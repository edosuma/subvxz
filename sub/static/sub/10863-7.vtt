00:30.480 --> 00:31.560
Ow!

00:31.560 --> 00:32.720
What happened?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.280
Somebody gave me a
flat tire, Frank.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.600
I'm in front
of you, dork.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.320
Then who stepped on my-
-- Shh!

00:37.320 --> 00:38.720
What is it?

00:38.720 --> 00:40.520
We got company.
Look.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.320
Maybe it's Gary.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.200
Do you think?

00:46.200 --> 00:50.800
Yeah. It's probably some costume
he got from his dad's store.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.800
Yeah. He's probably
just trying to spook us.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.640
Yo, Gary.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.000
We know it's you.
Cut it out.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.840
Gary: Cut what out?

01:00.840 --> 01:03.760
I-i-if you're here...

01:03.760 --> 01:06.720
Then, then who's the guy
with the hat?

01:08.800 --> 01:10.520
[All sigh]

01:12.320 --> 01:13.880
Did you do that?

01:13.880 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, OK. I confess.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.320
Man, you really had us going.

01:19.320 --> 01:20.480
[Sighs]

01:23.560 --> 01:25.240
What is all this?

01:25.240 --> 01:28.520
I found it in a trunk
in my dad's store.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.720
Help me out here, Sam.

01:32.720 --> 01:36.240
It was supposedly worn by
a strange order of monks

01:36.240 --> 01:38.240
hundreds of years ago.

01:38.240 --> 01:39.760
Cool.

01:39.760 --> 01:44.760
Yeah. Legend says these guys
were truly evil.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.480
The stories say they
had this magical power

01:47.480 --> 01:49.800
to take over
people's minds,

01:49.800 --> 01:56.400
and control
the forces of nature.

02:03.520 --> 02:07.200
Obviously, they're not
around anymore.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.560
But I had this idea.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.400
What if
these mystical monks

02:12.400 --> 02:14.000
had so much magical power

02:14.000 --> 02:17.000
that they learned
how to control the one thing

02:17.000 --> 02:21.080
that would make them
dangerous forever?

02:22.760 --> 02:24.480
Time.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.520
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.920
I call this story...

02:44.040 --> 02:46.000
<i> Alison Denny
and her family</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:47.120
<i> just moved into town.</i>

02:47.120 --> 02:49.160
<i> It's tough being the new kid,</i>

02:49.160 --> 02:51.160
<i> and having to make new friends.</i>

02:51.160 --> 02:53.520
<i> Alison knew that.</i>

02:53.520 --> 02:55.160
<i> What she didn't know</i>

02:55.160 --> 02:56.840
<i> was just how dangerous</i>

02:56.840 --> 02:57.880
<i> making a new friend</i>

02:57.880 --> 02:59.080
<i> was going to be.</i>

03:01.680 --> 03:03.120
I hate this place.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.320
Why did we have
to move here, anyway?

03:10.480 --> 03:13.600
T.J.B. Was here.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.600
Well, TJ, I wish
you still were.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.360
I wish anybody was here.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.800
Hello. Hey!

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
Hey!

03:51.120 --> 03:52.400
You, you dropped your...

03:52.400 --> 03:54.200
[Crunching]

03:54.200 --> 03:56.640
Aw, great way
to make friends, clutz.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.400
Where am I supposed
to find another pair of these?

04:18.760 --> 04:21.000
Well, 100.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.160
100?

04:22.160 --> 04:24.520
All right, 120.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.320
You know what I went
through to get this?

04:26.320 --> 04:27.960
The guy could have
killed me.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.040
Well, that's none
of my beeswax.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.280
200, or I'm taking
everything over

04:32.280 --> 04:33.960
to Uncle Bobo's
house of magic.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.560
Uncle Bobo?
That clown?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.040
All right, but I'm
losing on the deal.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.560
Hello?

04:40.560 --> 04:42.880
Shh, there's a customer.
Go away, go away!

04:42.880 --> 04:44.760
What can I do for you?

04:44.760 --> 04:47.160
Are you Mr. Sardo?

04:47.160 --> 04:48.560
That's Sardo.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.360
<i>No mister,
accent on the do.</i>

04:52.600 --> 04:55.640
So, what are you looking for?

04:55.640 --> 04:59.080
Hmm? A potion, a rare book?

04:59.080 --> 05:03.440
A priceless magical object
that only I can provide?

05:03.440 --> 05:07.360
No, I just need
another pair of these.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.520
That'll be 3.50.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.360
You're sure
there's nothing else?

05:18.360 --> 05:19.920
[Coins clattering]

05:19.920 --> 05:21.720
Have you seen our vomit?

05:21.720 --> 05:23.560
[Bangs head]
Excuse me?

05:23.560 --> 05:26.600
How's about a crystal ball?

05:26.600 --> 05:27.920
No, thanks.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.480
You're not from around here,
are you?

05:30.480 --> 05:32.680
No, we just moved in
last week.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.360
The old brown brick
house on Maple Lane?

05:35.360 --> 05:36.960
New kid, eh? Well, then,

05:36.960 --> 05:39.960
I don't suppose
I could interest you

05:39.960 --> 05:45.080
in a flask
of popularity potion?

05:45.080 --> 05:47.480
Are you serious?
A popularity potion?

05:47.480 --> 05:50.080
Wait right there.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.240
I just bought this from...
I mean, um...

05:54.240 --> 05:56.360
I've searched
the world over

05:56.360 --> 06:00.880
for the curios contained
in this chest.

06:00.880 --> 06:02.000
Observe.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.520
Um, there's got
to be something...

06:06.520 --> 06:08.840
I mean, um,
where is that potion?

06:08.840 --> 06:10.960
[Cries out]

06:10.960 --> 06:11.920
Aha!

06:13.080 --> 06:15.280
That's not a potion.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.360
No, no, of course not.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.480
It's much better
than a potion.

06:19.480 --> 06:25.560
It's a...It's an Egyptian
friendship stone.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.440
Let me see.

06:32.360 --> 06:33.640
How does it work?

06:33.640 --> 06:34.680
It's quite simple.

06:34.680 --> 06:38.000
Um, you just hold it
in your hand,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.160
close your eyes,

06:40.160 --> 06:48.120
and recite the ancient
Egyptian spell.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.440
Amrak...

06:50.440 --> 06:52.440
Vitulin...

06:52.440 --> 06:53.200
Ra.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.240
Amrak vitulin ra.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.120
Yes.
And then what?

07:00.120 --> 07:03.840
That's it. Presto,
you'll have more friends

07:03.840 --> 07:06.800
than you'll know
what to do with.

07:06.800 --> 07:10.360
I don't know. How much
did you say this was?

07:10.360 --> 07:16.960
Well, it is very rare
and very powerful.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.440
It's practically a steal
at, um...

07:22.200 --> 07:23.360
$50.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.480
$50?

07:24.480 --> 07:26.520
40. I distinctly
said 40. 40.

07:26.520 --> 07:27.720
Forget it.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.120
Now wait. Uh,
how much have you got?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.920
After the glasses,
I've got $17

07:33.920 --> 07:36.640
and 75 cents.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.600
Sold. But I'm losing
on the deal.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.040
[Growls]

08:07.040 --> 08:10.160
Amrak vitulis...

08:10.160 --> 08:11.120
Amrak vitulin spa.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.320
No, that's not right.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.920
What's the stupid spell?

08:18.920 --> 08:20.560
[Doorbell rings]

08:29.560 --> 08:30.480
Uh, are you Alison?

08:30.480 --> 08:32.320
Uh, yeah. I am.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.880
Well, you were
outside before,

08:34.880 --> 08:37.080
and you dropped these.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.320
Don, that's what
you called us

08:39.320 --> 08:42.320
to come all the way
over here for,

08:42.320 --> 08:44.280
some stupid glasses?

08:44.280 --> 08:46.280
Well, yeah.
I mean, I'm new,

08:46.280 --> 08:49.080
and I thought we could,
you know...

08:49.080 --> 08:51.080
Forget this.
Get a life, OK?

08:51.080 --> 08:52.440
Come on, Don.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.960
Well, thanks. Bye.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.160
Sure.

09:03.360 --> 09:05.720
I'm such a loser.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.800
Egyptian friendship stone?

09:07.800 --> 09:09.280
Yeah, right.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.440
Hello? Hello.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.520
Anybody, anybody here?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.440
Hello.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.920
Hey, Mr. Sardo.
Are you OK?

09:26.920 --> 09:29.840
That's Sardo, not...

09:29.840 --> 09:31.920
Are you sure
you're all right?

09:33.680 --> 09:34.760
Everything is fine.

09:34.760 --> 09:38.800
Well, I think I
want a refund, OK?

09:38.800 --> 09:42.240
[Imitating Sardo] Please
leave. The store is closed.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.240
But your sign says
you're open until--

09:44.240 --> 09:48.560
did you hear what I said? I
command you to leave at once.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.960
[Clattering]

10:00.440 --> 10:05.440
Now, for the last time,
shopkeeper,

10:05.440 --> 10:07.160
where...

10:08.880 --> 10:09.800
Is the amulet?

10:09.800 --> 10:12.240
I told you,
I don't know.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.880
It was in this chest

10:13.880 --> 10:16.200
which you snatched
from its hiding place

10:16.200 --> 10:17.280
just this very morning.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.600
I didn't snatch it,

10:18.600 --> 10:20.760
and I haven't seen
any amulet.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.000
But if it's charms
you're interested in--

10:23.000 --> 10:25.840
look into my eyes.
Do I have to?

10:25.840 --> 10:28.160
Look, you babbling mortal,
into my eyes.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.560
I seek the amulet
of Ankara.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.480
It is a most unusual
black stone,

10:34.480 --> 10:37.320
elaborately carved.

10:40.320 --> 10:46.520
Now what have you
done with it?

10:50.120 --> 10:52.000
I sold it
this afternoon.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.360
You sold it.
To whom?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.480
To the new girl.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.600
New girl.
She lives in

10:56.600 --> 10:58.640
brown brick house.
Brown brick house.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.600
Maple Lane.
On Maple Lane.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.600
It was--
yes?

11:01.600 --> 11:02.640
It was--
yes?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.360
It was... her.
Yes!

11:13.960 --> 11:16.640
[Inhales deeply]

11:18.760 --> 11:21.520
Yeah. OK.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.200
Well, what are you
gonna see?

11:24.840 --> 11:25.600
Oh.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.280
Yeah, I'm making
lots of friends.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.760
OK. You guys have fun
at the movie.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.320
Yeah. OK. Bye.

11:40.120 --> 11:42.000
Egyptian friendship stone.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.760
Well, if you're
a friendship stone,

11:43.760 --> 11:45.600
then I'm Madonna.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.040
Hello?

11:59.040 --> 12:00.320
Who's there?

12:20.200 --> 12:21.040
Alison.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.400
Alison Denny?

12:28.040 --> 12:30.120
Look at me, Alison.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.160
Look into my eyes.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.040
Gaze into my eyes.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.360
Who are you?
What do you want?

12:44.360 --> 12:48.280
I believe you have
what I want, Alison.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.600
Just keep looking
into my eyes.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.200
It's the amulet I want.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.120
I need the amulet.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.600
No. Go away.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.480
Stop! Go no further.

13:01.480 --> 13:04.160
No, no, no, no. Oh, no!

13:05.360 --> 13:07.760
Aaaaagggggghhhhhhhhhh!

13:12.560 --> 13:14.520
Who are you?

13:14.520 --> 13:17.120
Hey, how'd you do that?

13:17.120 --> 13:18.720
How did you get
in my room?

13:18.720 --> 13:19.840
Your room?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.960
This is my room.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.600
What happened?
What's going on?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.680
I don't know. You came
flying out of my mirror.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.040
<i> Your mirror?
Who are you?</i>

13:36.040 --> 13:38.560
I'm Thomas Jefferson
Bradshaw,

13:38.560 --> 13:40.480
and this is
my grandmother's house.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.360
No, this is our house.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.680
We moved in here
last week.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.480
Are you sure
of the address?

13:46.480 --> 13:48.160
Both: 15 Maple Lane.

13:49.800 --> 13:53.840
Wow. Something really weird
just happened.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.920
I want you to leave.
Now.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.000
Thomas Jefferson Bradshaw.

14:04.160 --> 14:07.400
This is my room,
but it's different.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.360
Listen, Tom, I'm Alison,

14:14.360 --> 14:18.320
and I think I've got
some kind of magic stone.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.680
Magic stone?

14:20.680 --> 14:23.600
This. It changed the mirror
and I saw you,

14:23.600 --> 14:27.200
like it opened a door to a different
dimension, or a different...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.920
What's the date today?

14:28.920 --> 14:30.640
March 13.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.720
Yeah, but what year?

14:32.720 --> 14:35.240
What year? Don't you
know anything?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.280
It's 1892.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.320
Are you serious?
1892?

14:40.320 --> 14:41.920
That's over 100 years ago.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.960
Tom, this stone let me
travel back in time.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.640
This is my house,
only 100 years ago.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.960
Golly, it sounds like a story
Jules Verne would write.

14:51.960 --> 14:55.520
Yeah, or Steven Spielberg.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.960
Who?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.200
I don't believe this.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.040
I mean,
look at this stuff.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.880
Oh, those are
my parents.

15:11.880 --> 15:12.960
[Coughing]

15:12.960 --> 15:14.200
Who's that?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.680
Shh. That's
my grandmother.

15:15.680 --> 15:19.360
If she wakes up,
she's gonna cane me.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.560
That's terrible.
What about your parents?

15:22.560 --> 15:25.200
Oh, well, they died
when I was younger.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.600
I was their only child.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.080
Really? I'm an only child too.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.120
What about your friends?

15:32.120 --> 15:33.640
I don't have any.

15:33.640 --> 15:36.120
My grandmother never
lets me out of the house.

15:36.120 --> 15:37.600
You're kidding.
That's gross.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.600
Were you allowed to bring
friends into this house

15:40.600 --> 15:41.600
in your time?

15:41.600 --> 15:43.760
I would have,
if I had any.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.240
I'm not exactly
miss popularity.

15:47.240 --> 15:51.200
Alison, are you
really from the future?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.040
Well, yeah,
I guess I am.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.120
Golly jeepers.
It must be wonderful.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.520
Hey, why don't
I show you?

15:59.520 --> 16:01.600
Show me? How?

16:01.600 --> 16:05.680
Well, we'll go back the way
I came, through the mirror.

16:05.680 --> 16:07.960
I mean--
Oh, this could be great.

16:07.960 --> 16:10.280
I could take you
to a movie

16:10.280 --> 16:11.600
and get a pizza.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.560
Man, you're gonna die
when you see video games.

16:15.560 --> 16:18.000
Die? I don't
want to die.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.200
I didn't mean die as in,
like, check-out time.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.520
It's a figure of speech.
Come on.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.600
Check-out time? Hmm.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.080
Will it work
with any mirror?

16:29.080 --> 16:31.520
I don't know.
Let's see.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.200
What's wrong?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.480
Well, there was this
really horrible man

16:35.480 --> 16:36.480
outside my house.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.440
He wanted the stone.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.520
Yeah, well, don't worry.

16:40.520 --> 16:43.040
I got a crackerjack shot.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.920
OK. We got to go
through sometime.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.160
Yup.

16:50.280 --> 16:51.600
Jeepers.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.160
It's, it's my house.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.320
And mine.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.720
Oh, right. Our house.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.640
So... what does
the future look like?

17:02.640 --> 17:04.400
[Doorbell rings]

17:04.400 --> 17:05.520
Oh.

17:05.520 --> 17:08.560
[Knock on door]

17:10.960 --> 17:12.400
Tom: Aaaagggghhhh!

17:12.400 --> 17:14.359
Don't scream.
You'll wake the neighbors.

17:14.359 --> 17:15.640
Is that the man?

17:15.640 --> 17:17.720
No, it's OK. What
are you doing here?

17:17.720 --> 17:20.359
I came to warn you
about that stone.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.160
It appears it really is
a powerful amulet.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.119
Yeah.
I found that out.

17:23.119 --> 17:24.760
It seems it belongs

17:24.760 --> 17:26.440
to a rather nasty fellow

17:26.440 --> 17:28.480
by the name
of Brother Septimus.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.960
He was supposed to have been
hanged in the 15th century--

17:31.960 --> 17:33.920
give me the amulet.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.400
What do we do?

17:35.400 --> 17:36.920
This way.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.480
Oh, you will suffer

17:38.480 --> 17:40.120
the torment
of eternal pain

17:40.120 --> 17:44.040
for having crossed
me, Mr. Shopkeeper.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.680
Eternal pain
seems rather harsh.

17:45.680 --> 17:50.000
Yes, but I'll not
be denied any longer!

17:50.000 --> 17:53.400
Either you retrieve
the amulet,

17:53.400 --> 17:55.120
or I shall
slice open

17:55.120 --> 17:57.840
your miserable
carcass

17:57.840 --> 18:01.840
and serve it to the
great rats of the abyss.

18:05.120 --> 18:07.000
Ouch.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.760
Hey, mister.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.240
Look what I have.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.000
Why, you impertinent
little--

18:13.000 --> 18:14.320
Here!

18:16.840 --> 18:18.920
Gotcha!

18:18.920 --> 18:20.200
Sardo: What's happening?

18:21.640 --> 18:23.440
Oh, my!

18:24.560 --> 18:25.720
[Growls]

18:25.720 --> 18:28.200
You will pay, child!

18:28.200 --> 18:29.880
What happened?
Come on!

18:29.880 --> 18:32.440
We've got to help tom
get out of the future.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.920
Help? I don't even
know what's going on.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.320
Come on.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.320
When you hold the amulet
next to a mirror,

18:39.320 --> 18:40.360
it opens a door
through time.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.680
A door through time.

18:41.680 --> 18:42.920
This could be
worth millions.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.120
We have to get tom
before Septimus does.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.120
Not so fast.
Not so fast.

18:47.120 --> 18:51.880
Now, if I could just get
past that horrid demon person,

18:51.880 --> 18:55.360
I could turn this
into a small fortune.

18:55.360 --> 19:00.120
Or better still,
a huge fortune.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.280
Mr. Sardo, wait.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.280
That's sardo, not--
Oh, skip it.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.160
How does it work?

19:07.840 --> 19:08.880
Like this?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.480
Aaaaaggggghhhhhhhh!

19:21.880 --> 19:24.360
Give me the amulet.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.880
I-I-don't have the amulet.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.520
I grow so weary
of this game, child.

19:32.520 --> 19:39.160
You know not the power
with which you deal.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.000
You will suffer

19:41.000 --> 19:43.920
for having toyed
with me. Now--

19:43.920 --> 19:45.280
Leave her alone.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.400
I got your rock.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.400
You... pathetic
little urchin?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.560
[Laughing]

19:54.720 --> 19:57.280
You believe
you are a match for me?

19:57.280 --> 20:02.200
You and your little toy?

20:02.200 --> 20:04.000
[Laughing]

20:04.000 --> 20:07.840
All fall on their knees
before me.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.160
Don't look into his eyes.

20:09.160 --> 20:13.520
Even death himself
bows to me,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.160
the Great Septimus.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.520
You see,
I need the amulet.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.160
It was so much easier

20:22.160 --> 20:28.640
traveling through time
to claim my victims.

20:28.640 --> 20:33.120
I have gone
far too long without one.

20:33.120 --> 20:38.400
You... shall have the honor

20:38.400 --> 20:41.600
of being my next.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.960
[Chuckling]

20:46.760 --> 20:48.480
Tom!

20:49.920 --> 20:51.120
No!

20:58.920 --> 21:01.080
Check-out time.

21:03.560 --> 21:05.960
[Glass shattering]

21:19.320 --> 21:20.360
Where's the stone?

21:20.360 --> 21:22.440
You got it,
didn't you?

21:22.440 --> 21:26.480
[Septimus moaning]

21:27.920 --> 21:30.400
[Moaning]

21:30.400 --> 21:33.160
Aaaaaaaggggggghhhhhhhh!

21:36.760 --> 21:38.320
Tom: Alison!

21:38.320 --> 21:40.080
Tom! Tom,
where are you?

21:40.080 --> 21:42.920
I'm down here,
Alison.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.080
Come on through!

21:47.080 --> 21:48.480
It's too late.

21:48.480 --> 21:49.800
But you have to.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.240
I can't.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.040
I'm sorry.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.080
Don't be.

21:55.080 --> 21:57.400
I'm glad I finally
made a friend.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.280
Good-bye, Alison.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.640
Good-bye.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.800
Have a good life.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.040
My, what an interesting
twist of fate.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.720
What? What is it?

22:30.160 --> 22:34.920
Alison and Tom,
friends forever.

22:39.680 --> 22:41.800
The amulet was gone.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.440
Brother Septimus
was never seen again.

22:45.440 --> 22:47.040
And Alison
would never forget

22:47.040 --> 22:50.920
the first friend she made
in her new home.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.480
I declare this meeting

22:57.480 --> 23:01.200
of the Midnight Society closed.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.760
Until next time.

23:09.880 --> 23:10.800
Nice going, bro.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.000
Can I try
your hat on?
