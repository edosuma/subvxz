00:38.888 --> 00:40.139
Thank you.

00:40.179 --> 00:41.770
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:49.296 --> 00:51.678
You want me to do this?

00:52.739 --> 00:54.941
No, I got it.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.543
There's a scrape on her leg.

00:57.603 --> 01:01.066
She might've been dragged.
Maybe into the river.

01:03.558 --> 01:05.740
There's an indentation on her cheek.

01:05.780 --> 01:08.362
Make sure you get a picture of that.

01:09.192 --> 01:11.494
She probably wasn't killed here.

01:21.172 --> 01:23.624
Her underwear's missing.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.107
Could you, uh…

01:27.157 --> 01:29.389
get her to the morgue, please?

01:29.419 --> 01:31.430
I got to get to the mother
before the press does.

01:31.470 --> 01:34.133
Thank you very much.

01:34.843 --> 01:36.294
She's all yours.

01:36.314 --> 01:39.017
Make sure you get the cheek.

01:46.563 --> 01:48.274
Thank you.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.176
Detective Sanchez.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.968
What have you told her?

01:53.028 --> 01:54.569
I was waiting until you got here.

01:54.609 --> 01:57.922
Ok. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:57.962 --> 01:59.973
Thank you.

02:04.777 --> 02:05.958
Who's that man with her?

02:05.998 --> 02:08.100
It's her cousin
Alejandro. He lives here.

02:08.139 --> 02:10.142
Works for the same
family as their gardener.

02:10.181 --> 02:12.774
Ok. Thank you.

02:13.074 --> 02:16.066
Father, please excuse me. Thank you.

02:16.107 --> 02:18.048
Carmen Alvarez?

02:18.108 --> 02:19.659
I'm Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,

02:19.699 --> 02:22.201
L. A. P. D, Priority Homicide Division.

02:22.241 --> 02:25.937
Do you speak english? Do you
understand what I'm saying?

02:27.836 --> 02:31.979
We found a little girl in
the L. A. river this afternoon,

02:32.019 --> 02:34.121
who we believe to be your daughter.

02:34.161 --> 02:37.324
She's wearing the same
clothes that Marta was wearing

02:37.364 --> 02:40.486
and I think it was her.

02:42.988 --> 02:46.651
No es mi Marta!

02:46.691 --> 02:48.953
Not my Marta!

03:02.094 --> 03:03.575
Based on the level of decomp

03:03.615 --> 03:04.896
and the amount of time
she's been in the water,

03:04.936 --> 03:09.870
I guess she's been dead
between 46 and 52 hours.

03:10.811 --> 03:13.143
So…

03:13.223 --> 03:18.477
We're talking between
2 and 8 p. m. on Monday?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.000
I'm going to start with the rape kit.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.472
Why don't you stand over there and
I can tell you everything I see?

03:24.512 --> 03:27.764
–You'll know everything I know.
–I'm supposed to watch.

03:27.804 --> 03:30.056
All right.

03:30.987 --> 03:32.422
Ok then.

03:49.650 --> 03:52.999
I see a lot of tearing.

04:09.693 --> 04:13.162
You've been waiting
out here the whole time?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.521
Nowhere to go.

04:15.581 --> 04:17.495
Did you have dinner at least?

04:17.510 --> 04:19.820
You kidding?

04:21.079 --> 04:23.208
Cause of death?

04:23.278 --> 04:25.937
Oh, blunt force trauma to the head.

04:25.967 --> 04:28.946
The blow was so strong
that it broke her neck,

04:28.986 --> 04:31.865
but, uh… the lungs were empty.

04:33.615 --> 04:35.384
So she died before she hit the water?

04:35.424 --> 04:37.533
Yeah. And that bruise you
asked about on the cheek,

04:37.573 --> 04:39.833
that happened after death.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.612
There was evidence of sexual assault.

04:41.652 --> 04:44.181
A lot of ripping, a lot of tearing.

04:44.211 --> 04:46.181
Well, she was a virgin.

04:46.221 --> 04:48.780
You can read the report.

04:48.870 --> 04:50.439
DNA?

04:50.479 --> 04:52.208
The L. A. river contaminated her body.

04:52.248 --> 04:54.328
I scraped her nails, I combed her hair,

04:54.368 --> 04:56.387
but there was nothing.

04:56.407 --> 04:58.326
I'll rush the rape kit, but…

04:58.366 --> 05:01.285
I'll hold my breath.

05:02.525 --> 05:05.154
Are you feeling better?

05:05.204 --> 05:06.404
No.

05:06.444 --> 05:10.112
Thanks for asking.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.660
Is there anything else I should know?

05:15.740 --> 05:18.440
There was no evidence of torture.

05:18.490 --> 05:21.196
No evidence of her
being beaten or bound.

05:21.249 --> 05:25.527
Whatever happened to her she
didn't hurt for very long.

05:31.585 --> 05:34.394
I just got here. We're about
to interview the family.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.433
Wow. It's a nice place.

05:37.673 --> 05:40.102
Yeah. I'll keep you posted.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.801
Kids by definition
can be very resilient.

05:44.391 --> 05:47.770
Marta adapted to America very quickly.

05:47.790 --> 05:51.408
When did you meet
them… Marta and Carmen?

05:54.227 --> 05:56.087
3 years ago.

05:56.117 --> 05:57.666
I'm sorry.

05:57.686 --> 05:59.446
Me too.

05:59.486 --> 06:03.054
–Our last housekeeper left.
–She got pregnant.

06:03.094 --> 06:05.993
Alejandro our gardener,
that's Carmen's nephew.

06:06.033 --> 06:06.853
Cousin, mom.

06:06.903 --> 06:09.422
Cousin. That's right. Cousin.

06:09.462 --> 06:12.501
Anyway, he's the one that introduced us.

06:12.521 --> 06:15.700
–They had just gotten here.
–What was her daily routine?

06:15.740 --> 06:16.810
Well, let's see.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.339
Monday through Friday,
Carmen would ride with Marta

06:19.379 --> 06:22.368
on the bus to school.
Excuse me, sweetheart.

06:22.408 --> 06:25.177
And then she would walk back here.

06:25.267 --> 06:27.436
–Have you seen the baggies?
–Yeah.

06:27.476 --> 06:31.944
And then Marta would come directly
home after she got out of her studies.

06:31.984 --> 06:33.734
Thank you.

06:37.742 --> 06:42.201
Look, just so you know,
we pay her on the books,

06:42.211 --> 06:45.130
and that they've always
gotten health insurance, too.

06:45.170 --> 06:49.658
And we never treated them as if
they were anything less than family.

06:49.828 --> 06:53.227
What kind of a monster would do
something like this to a child?

06:53.267 --> 06:56.976
And why can't we protect
our children in this country?

06:57.006 --> 06:58.685
How are we doing here?

06:58.735 --> 07:00.355
We're fine, we're fine.

07:00.385 --> 07:02.204
Are you… are you leaving?

07:02.244 --> 07:03.864
Yeah. Just for the morning.

07:03.904 --> 07:05.463
I'll be at Carnaby's at 2:00.

07:05.503 --> 07:06.345
Deputy…

07:06.380 --> 07:07.382
Chief Johnson. Yes.

07:07.422 --> 07:08.492
Yes. Hart Phillips.

07:08.532 --> 07:10.791
Thank you so much for
everything you're doing here.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.850
I was hoping to get a chance
to talk to you before you left.

07:12.890 --> 07:14.210
Oh. I would love to.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.449
I'm sorry. I have this
morning that I just…

07:16.489 --> 07:18.798
I can't cancel. But anytime
this evening, though.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.008
Yes, I'm here.

07:20.038 --> 07:21.687
I'm here. Just hang on one second.

07:21.727 --> 07:24.347
I have this licensing agreement

07:24.387 --> 07:28.075
that I… it's gotta
be wrapped up by today.

07:28.205 --> 07:30.005
How are you doing, buddy?

07:30.035 --> 07:30.994
You hanging in there?

07:31.034 --> 07:33.154
Yeah, yeah. Kind of. Heh!

07:33.184 --> 07:35.613
We'll talk more tonight.

07:35.733 --> 07:37.742
Yes. Yes, sorry.

07:37.992 --> 07:40.471
Oh, I know. We're all mourning out here.

07:40.511 --> 07:42.600
Yeah, I know. It's horrible stuff.

07:42.640 --> 07:44.810
Listen, I told you, we can
beat the price, all right?

07:44.850 --> 07:46.549
We manufacture in China, all right?

07:46.589 --> 07:48.018
That's what I've been saying.

07:48.058 --> 07:49.228
He would stay if he could.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.887
Really. I know he's just as
upset about this as we are.

07:51.927 --> 07:53.577
I'm sure.

07:53.956 --> 07:57.155
Did you notice anyone
unusual around the house

07:57.195 --> 07:59.574
recently or in the neighborhood?

07:59.604 --> 08:02.384
Did you have any work done on the house?

08:02.404 --> 08:03.843
No.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.731
What is it?

08:12.770 --> 08:16.409
You know, it's probably nothing. Heh!

08:16.659 --> 08:19.968
–What?
–Well…

08:20.058 --> 08:22.127
There was this one guy.

08:22.177 --> 08:24.216
I don't think he's
doing work in the area,

08:24.256 --> 08:26.855
but he always carries a camera.

08:26.895 --> 08:27.785
Oh, god.

08:27.820 --> 08:29.804
What does he look like?

08:29.854 --> 08:31.963
I don't know. Average height.

08:32.003 --> 08:35.772
Dark hair. 30's, maybe?

08:35.802 --> 08:39.341
Could I borrow you for a couple
hours to look at some faces?

08:39.381 --> 08:40.780
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.440
–Great.
–Of course.

08:45.239 --> 08:47.068
This is your zip code

08:47.118 --> 08:50.547
and these are the sex
offenders who live there.

08:50.577 --> 08:52.336
Talk about know thy neighbor.

08:52.376 --> 08:54.546
Thanks to this website for
tracking down sex offenders,

08:54.586 --> 08:57.025
we were able to narrow
down our search somewhat,

08:57.065 --> 08:58.994
first by the description you gave us

08:59.034 --> 09:01.103
and by the type of offense.

09:01.143 --> 09:02.873
Some of these guys are into boys,

09:02.913 --> 09:05.492
some into much younger girls.

09:05.522 --> 09:08.651
That leaves us with 13 people.

09:14.239 --> 09:16.058
Wait. That guy. Who's he?

09:41.411 --> 09:44.819
I'm looking for a Wayne Mathers.

09:48.976 --> 09:52.693
Yoohoo! Sir, I saw you.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.280
I'm not leaving, sir.

10:01.528 --> 10:07.613
I'm Wayne Mathers.
This is my mother Vera.

10:07.663 --> 10:09.882
We're here about Marta Alvarez.

10:09.902 --> 10:11.881
Of course you are.

10:11.911 --> 10:15.118
This is the fourth time
in 2 months you people

10:15.128 --> 10:18.806
come to my house question my son.

10:19.216 --> 10:20.605
You take a lot of pictures.

10:20.645 --> 10:23.543
I'm a photographer. Am I under arrest?

10:23.583 --> 10:25.641
Why can't you just leave us alone⁈

10:25.681 --> 10:28.729
Mother, stay out of this, please.

10:28.809 --> 10:29.938
Am I under arrest?

10:29.978 --> 10:32.827
You mind showing us
your photographs, Wayne?

10:32.867 --> 10:36.074
You're gonna take them
from me, aren't you?

10:36.104 --> 10:40.581
Or you could bring them downtown,
have a little chat with us.

10:48.496 --> 10:50.615
Can I change my shirt before we go?

10:50.655 --> 10:52.773
Yes, you can.

10:55.981 --> 10:58.709
You people! You people!

10:58.729 --> 11:00.668
Sergeant Gabriel.

11:02.187 --> 11:03.686
Would you please go out the back,

11:03.726 --> 11:04.925
make sure he didn't go out the window?

11:04.965 --> 11:07.064
–Yes, ma'am.
–Thank you.

11:08.942 --> 11:14.569
Ma'am, were you here last Monday
between the hours of 2 and 8 p. m.

11:16.108 --> 11:18.436
–Wayne!
–Shut up! Shut up!

11:18.466 --> 11:21.714
Wayne? What are you doing, Wayne?

11:21.744 --> 11:24.832
What's going on? What's
going on in there?

11:24.862 --> 11:26.621
I'm gonna open the door.

11:26.661 --> 11:28.459
Wayne, I'm opening the door.

11:28.499 --> 11:31.148
Wayne? Wayne?

11:31.188 --> 11:34.525
Oh, shoot.

11:34.815 --> 11:37.413
Chief? Chief?

11:37.473 --> 11:38.712
Oh, my god.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.851
Oh, my god.

11:40.891 --> 11:43.080
I need 2 units, my location. Code 3.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.358
Shots fired. I repeat, shots fired.

11:45.398 --> 11:47.796
Send paramedics. Oh, my god.

11:50.751 --> 11:55.485
We can't develop Wayne Mathers'
photographs in the usual way

11:55.515 --> 11:58.288
because S. I. D wants to
examine the filmcanisters

11:58.328 --> 12:00.920
for prints and DNA before they're opened

12:00.960 --> 12:03.402
and it's going to take at least
2 days to get a workup on the van,

12:03.442 --> 12:06.165
but we have his computer
and I want that broken down,

12:06.205 --> 12:09.108
and I want to find out how Marta got
into the L. A. river to begin with.

12:09.148 --> 12:10.799
Excuse me, chief.

12:10.849 --> 12:12.210
Yes, lieutenant Provenza.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.442
We do good work here, but you know,

12:14.482 --> 12:16.824
we hardly ever get confessions
out of the dead guys

12:16.864 --> 12:19.547
even when we slap them
around a few times.

12:19.587 --> 12:22.700
So what's the point?

12:22.720 --> 12:24.952
We found Marta but at the present time,

12:24.992 --> 12:31.317
there are 257 other 12-13 year old
missing latina girls in this city.

12:31.347 --> 12:36.082
257 that we know of.
There could be 1000,2000.

12:36.112 --> 12:37.373
Sergeant Gabriel's right, ma'am.

12:37.413 --> 12:38.684
Illegals don't exist in this country.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.528
Which makes them ideal
targets for child molesters.

12:42.928 --> 12:49.254
Anyhow, I want to know if Marta was
the only one that Wayne managed to find.

12:50.935 --> 12:52.757
What?

12:52.807 --> 12:54.568
Well, it's just, you know,

12:54.598 --> 12:56.530
Daniels is away at the
Homeland Security seminar

12:56.570 --> 12:58.912
and you sent lieutenant Flynn
back to Robbery-Homicide.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.014
We're a little short-staffed.

13:01.044 --> 13:04.207
Yes, we're working light, but there
are questions that need answering

13:04.247 --> 13:05.438
before we close up shop.

13:05.478 --> 13:07.510
So if you would, sergeant Gabriel,

13:07.550 --> 13:10.393
get a crew together and
dig up Wayne's backyard.

13:10.433 --> 13:13.405
Make sure that there's nothing
and no one buried there.

13:13.445 --> 13:15.347
Check under the house,
too, and the garage.

13:15.387 --> 13:17.569
I want to find out how she
got that bruise on her cheek.

13:17.609 --> 13:19.631
Lieutenant Provenza, if
you could go to Trinity

13:19.671 --> 13:21.152
and talk to her teachers.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.624
Find out who her friends were.

13:22.664 --> 13:25.436
Let's see if we can figure out
when and where Wayne grabbed her,

13:25.476 --> 13:28.429
remembering the choice of
victim in this kind of crime

13:28.469 --> 13:31.211
is usually based on availability.

13:31.281 --> 13:34.044
Lieutenant Tao, Wayne's computer.

13:34.084 --> 13:38.678
And detective Sanchez, if you could
run these photos by Marta's family.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.040
Thank you very much.

13:43.222 --> 13:47.406
Look, um… I don't like
this kind of investigation

13:47.436 --> 13:49.698
any more than the rest of you,

13:49.728 --> 13:52.951
but I want to go to sleep at night
knowing that we buried the killer

13:52.991 --> 13:55.693
and not his crimes.

13:56.434 --> 13:58.547
Thank you.

14:07.660 --> 14:13.525
I'm trying to find out how the man
who did that to Marta chose her.

14:14.764 --> 14:18.611
Do you recognize any of these
gentlemen around your apartment

14:18.651 --> 14:20.000
or the Phillips' house?

14:20.040 --> 14:21.539
You may have just seen them in passing.

14:21.579 --> 14:24.219
He had a camera. He often took pictures.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.821
No. None of them.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.275
It's my fault.

14:52.296 --> 14:54.012
How? How is it your fault?

14:54.037 --> 14:56.198
Carmen lost her husband.

14:56.468 --> 14:59.660
We come from a very poor family.

14:59.710 --> 15:01.711
She was desperate.

15:01.741 --> 15:05.934
The Phillips were looking
for a new maid fast…

15:06.004 --> 15:07.545
So I talked her into coming.

15:07.585 --> 15:10.617
Fast? How did you manage that?

15:10.647 --> 15:14.559
How did you get them over the border?

15:18.301 --> 15:20.723
–A coyote.
–A what?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.854
A coyote. A professional guy.

15:22.884 --> 15:26.026
Someone who sneaks people
into America from Mexico.

15:26.066 --> 15:30.689
A professional guy?
How much does he charge?

15:30.729 --> 15:32.700
$2,600 per person.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.601
Gosh! That's a lot.

15:34.631 --> 15:37.193
Yes. Yes. Too much.

15:40.475 --> 15:44.097
Who paid for them… Carmen and Marta?

15:45.118 --> 15:47.729
I did. I paid.

15:47.749 --> 15:49.520
So the Phillips needed a new maid,

15:49.560 --> 15:53.333
and at that moment, you just happened
to have $5,000 in your pocket?

15:53.373 --> 15:55.014
Yes. Yes, I paid!

15:55.044 --> 15:59.656
You know what, Alejandro?
I don't believe you.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.219
–I want a lawyer.
–You want a lawyer?

16:03.259 --> 16:07.131
What happens to the citizens
who don't get a lawyer?

16:07.161 --> 16:10.383
Are you running a little
agency on the side?

16:10.403 --> 16:13.385
Selling your relatives, tu
familia, to needy anglos?

16:13.425 --> 16:15.486
All right! Detective Sanchez, sit down.

16:15.526 --> 16:17.223
Sit down. That's enough.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.892
The man took advantage of Marta's
age and her illegal status.

16:30.932 --> 16:32.233
He raped her, murdered her,

16:32.273 --> 16:35.805
and threw her in the L. A. river
just like a piece of garbage,

16:35.845 --> 16:38.096
and I want to know how he did it.

16:38.126 --> 16:42.009
If you know anything that can help me,

16:42.059 --> 16:46.481
I would deeply appreciate it.

16:50.053 --> 16:52.244
Detective Sanchez.

16:57.797 --> 17:00.399
Detective Sanchez.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.861
I worry about your temper.

17:03.901 --> 17:06.673
I want to talk to him,
not scare him away.

17:06.842 --> 17:10.034
–Ok.
–But…

17:10.094 --> 17:12.005
Find out what you can about Alejandro.

17:12.045 --> 17:14.949
You can be tougher on
him when we know more.

17:15.176 --> 17:18.019
Thank you very much.

17:19.279 --> 17:20.910
Special delivery.

17:20.950 --> 17:22.941
Is it the escape hatch I ordered?

17:22.981 --> 17:24.531
Nothing from Marta's school

17:24.571 --> 17:25.792
or from the creep's computer

17:25.833 --> 17:27.273
or his backyard or his garage.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.965
So what's the special delivery?

17:29.005 --> 17:33.327
The creep's mama, waiting
for you in your office.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.092
I've got one hell of a
lawsuit against the L. A. P. D

17:41.132 --> 17:44.193
Ma'am, there's no smoking in my office.

17:44.954 --> 17:46.274
I want my son's photos.

17:46.314 --> 17:48.926
Would you like to have a seat, ma'am?

17:50.907 --> 17:52.425
I want my son's photos.

17:52.448 --> 17:54.239
Did you ever see any of them?

17:54.279 --> 17:56.070
Did he ever bring any
of his models home?

17:56.110 --> 17:59.882
My son didn't like taking
pictures of human beings.

17:59.902 --> 18:05.665
He liked taking pictures
of parks, gardens,

18:05.685 --> 18:07.086
stuff like that.

18:07.116 --> 18:09.988
You treated him like he was a terrorist.

18:10.018 --> 18:11.529
We have to monitor sex offenders.

18:11.569 --> 18:14.090
He was not a sex offender!

18:14.120 --> 18:16.321
He was a drunk, ok?

18:16.351 --> 18:18.973
Like all artistic types.

18:19.003 --> 18:21.974
And if you drink and
you probably should,

18:22.004 --> 18:24.866
you've gotta pee.

18:25.106 --> 18:28.298
So once, maybe twice,
he passed out in a park

18:28.328 --> 18:31.350
in front of little kids
with his pants down.

18:31.380 --> 18:34.131
That was it!

18:40.305 --> 18:44.667
Did you ever see this little
girl in any of your son's photos?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.761
Wayne would never hurt a kid.

18:51.791 --> 18:56.944
And why are you so upset
about this kid, anyway?

18:56.984 --> 18:59.145
This wetback…

18:59.195 --> 19:02.237
who's living here off of my tax dollar,

19:02.267 --> 19:04.518
and my son, he was an American,

19:04.538 --> 19:08.450
and this little spic is more
important to you than my Wayne was!

19:08.490 --> 19:14.514
You hounded an innocent man to death!

19:14.924 --> 19:17.937
My little boy. Mine!

19:27.847 --> 19:32.289
No. I not at the house
on Monday afternoons.

19:32.319 --> 19:34.641
I go to whole foods with Mrs Phillips

19:34.681 --> 19:36.521
after she come home from yoga.

19:36.561 --> 19:38.222
Every Monday?

19:38.372 --> 19:40.893
And is anyone else at
the Phillips' house?

19:40.933 --> 19:43.885
Is Alejandro working in the yard?

19:44.546 --> 19:48.718
No. Alejandro, he work twice a week,

19:48.748 --> 19:51.059
Tuesday and fridays.

19:51.099 --> 19:54.180
So who else knows what you do on Monday

19:54.201 --> 19:57.762
besides the Phillips
family and Alejandro?

19:59.472 --> 20:01.854
No one.

20:03.255 --> 20:07.707
I think here is safer than Mexico.

20:07.738 --> 20:09.909
Is better for Marta.

20:09.939 --> 20:14.441
Now I go home to bury her.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.844
Is Alejandro here today to help you?

20:20.884 --> 20:23.246
No. Ms Phillips, she help.

20:23.276 --> 20:27.038
She give me the money.
They come for funeral.

20:28.488 --> 20:32.120
Look. See?

20:34.030 --> 20:38.232
Ms Phillips, she help
Marta get into a school

20:38.253 --> 20:43.456
and Marta, she's so good in school.

20:43.626 --> 20:46.107
My baby, she was so smart.

20:46.147 --> 20:49.469
She tried so hard.

20:55.492 --> 20:58.634
Where did you get this paper?

20:58.694 --> 21:00.565
Uh, I…

21:00.634 --> 21:03.026
have closet at Mrs Phillips'.

21:03.056 --> 21:06.258
Marta always leave her
bag there after school.

21:06.288 --> 21:08.258
Mrs Phillips, she bring it to me

21:08.298 --> 21:10.070
when she bring all the food.

21:10.110 --> 21:14.562
This handout is dated the
day that Marta disappeared.

21:15.533 --> 21:19.745
Carmen, can I have the notebook,
please, and the backpack?

21:21.595 --> 21:25.037
I promise I'll get them back to you.

21:27.999 --> 21:31.630
Thank you. Thank you.

21:35.914 --> 21:38.110
If this backpack made it all the
way back to the Phillips' house,

21:38.150 --> 21:39.800
then Marta did, too.

21:39.841 --> 21:41.471
I think we might need
to call Leslie Phillips

21:41.511 --> 21:43.656
and tell her her house
might be a crime scene.

21:43.696 --> 21:45.498
And I want you to call
S. I. D and tell them

21:45.538 --> 21:47.694
I want Wayne Mathers'
photographs and I want them now.

21:47.734 --> 21:49.497
Yes, ma'am.

22:01.350 --> 22:02.650
–Listen to this.
–Hmm?

22:02.690 --> 22:06.716
Some guy in London, he assigned
monetary values to happiness.

22:06.721 --> 22:11.192
Getting married, he says, is the
equivalent of a $100,000 bonus.

22:11.232 --> 22:14.403
Photos we developed from our
favorite pedophile's house.

22:14.443 --> 22:18.474
You want to attach a monetary
value for sorting through this?

22:19.344 --> 22:21.464
God, no.

22:23.075 --> 22:24.485
Jesus.

22:24.525 --> 22:28.206
You think that horrible man
came into my home and took Marta?

22:28.246 --> 22:31.187
That he attacked her in my house?

22:31.216 --> 22:33.497
Oh, my god.

22:33.527 --> 22:36.338
Can we look around? Do you mind?

22:36.368 --> 22:39.628
Would you sign this consent form?

22:42.019 --> 22:43.667
Anything you need.

22:49.589 --> 22:52.985
Hello? Hey, dad.

22:53.045 --> 22:55.609
No, no. The cops came back.

22:55.649 --> 22:57.042
To search the house. I don't know.

22:57.082 --> 23:00.568
They said Marta could
have been hurt here.

23:01.099 --> 23:03.212
Yeah. Hold on.

23:03.733 --> 23:06.358
Mom, dad wants to talk to you.

23:06.398 --> 23:09.864
Wait, dad. Dad, you're
cutting in and out.

23:10.194 --> 23:13.850
Ok. Mom, dad said he
wants to talk to you.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.275
I heard you the first time.

23:16.315 --> 23:18.629
But he's calling back.

23:23.066 --> 23:25.490
–Mom.
–You get it, Austin.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.033
But…

23:27.093 --> 23:28.235
Hello.

23:39.602 --> 23:43.199
Sergeant Gabriel, does
this picture speak to you?

23:46.745 --> 23:50.042
Yeah. It says someone
might have smashed into it

23:50.073 --> 23:52.053
while falling down the stairs.

24:24.031 --> 24:26.869
So this is where all
the flowers have gone.

24:42.179 --> 24:43.930
So, it's Friday. Where's Alejandro?

24:43.970 --> 24:45.107
He didn't show today.

24:45.147 --> 24:48.697
He came by last night
and spoke to my father.

24:49.331 --> 24:52.540
–Where are they?
–Upstairs.

24:57.811 --> 24:59.270
All right, I don't know what
you're doing in my house.

24:59.310 --> 25:00.860
You caught the guy who did this.

25:00.900 --> 25:01.956
He shot himself.

25:01.996 --> 25:03.596
Actually, we have 2 suspects.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.885
–Who's the other guy?
–Alejandro.

25:06.975 --> 25:09.159
Ok. He doesn't usually do a
lot of gardening in my house.

25:09.199 --> 25:11.854
I'm sorry, I must not have you
people going through my things.

25:11.894 --> 25:13.846
It's upsetting, I know,
but we'll be done soon.

25:13.886 --> 25:15.717
Yeah? Well, I'd like you to leave.

25:15.757 --> 25:17.669
–Right now!
–Sergeant Gabriel!

25:17.709 --> 25:21.501
Ahem! Your wife gave us her consent.

25:21.672 --> 25:25.022
Well, consider your consent revoked!

25:26.380 --> 25:27.854
Let's go.

25:36.221 --> 25:38.752
Marta disappeared around
3:30 on Monday, right?

25:38.792 --> 25:40.593
Well, the time/date
stamp on these azaleas

25:40.633 --> 25:43.715
is between 3:00 and
6:00 on the same day.

25:44.816 --> 25:48.398
–So that raises the question.
–Well, yeah. Yeah.

25:48.438 --> 25:51.779
How can this freak be innocent?

25:53.240 --> 25:57.002
No, your honor, I need a warrant
for the garage, the attic…

25:57.042 --> 26:00.054
All right, then. Put a warrant
out on Alejandro Alvarez.

26:00.094 --> 26:01.095
Gabriel here.

26:01.125 --> 26:04.336
No, your honor, I'm sorry.
Let me be more specific.

26:04.376 --> 26:06.818
I want nothing less
than a telephonic warrant

26:06.858 --> 26:08.659
for the house, the cars, the grounds,

26:08.699 --> 26:12.711
and any other property this family
might possess in the known universe.

26:12.751 --> 26:14.572
Yes, I'll hold.

26:14.632 --> 26:17.934
Lieutenant Provenza needs
to speak with you right now.

26:17.974 --> 26:19.665
Here.

26:20.375 --> 26:23.687
Lieutenant Provenza. Yes?

26:23.737 --> 26:25.508
You're kidding.

26:25.548 --> 26:29.490
Oh, my god. Are the cameras there?

26:30.471 --> 26:32.222
Tell lieutenant Tao to check and see

26:32.262 --> 26:35.203
if the time and date
stamp's been manipulated.

26:35.243 --> 26:36.934
Ok, thank you.

26:36.984 --> 26:37.915
What's up, chief?

26:37.955 --> 26:41.517
Looks like Wayne was photographing
azaleas when Marta was murdered.

26:41.557 --> 26:43.658
–Alejandro's gone.
–What?

26:43.698 --> 26:46.489
Either going back to
Mexico or to Oklahoma.

26:46.529 --> 26:48.631
–Where's Carmen?
–On her way to Mexico.

26:48.671 --> 26:51.742
Oh! Yeah, hold it.

26:51.772 --> 26:55.414
Yes. No, I'm still on hold.

26:55.474 --> 26:58.406
Yes. No, I'm right here.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.101
Yes, your honor?

27:07.861 --> 27:10.976
Thank you, your honor.
Yes, thank you so much.

27:30.471 --> 27:33.700
I've been talking to my family
and I want to do the right thing.

27:33.740 --> 27:35.709
I'm no longer interested
in what you want.

27:35.749 --> 27:37.049
I've got a warrant to search your house.

27:37.089 --> 27:40.938
Is there any place that
you and I can go to talk…

27:40.968 --> 27:41.998
alone.

27:42.048 --> 27:45.177
–We could go downtown.
–Ok, that's fine.

27:45.876 --> 27:47.266
You gonna be here when I get back?

27:47.306 --> 27:48.386
I don't want to spend one
more minute in this house.

27:48.426 --> 27:50.275
Leslie, there is an
explanation for all of this.

27:50.315 --> 27:53.004
I don't want to hear it. I
don't want to hear it, Hart!

27:53.044 --> 27:53.954
We're going to my mother's.

27:53.994 --> 27:55.084
Ma'am, you're gonna have to get a ride

27:55.124 --> 27:58.503
because these cars stay here
until we look through them.

27:58.543 --> 28:01.892
Mina's home. Come on, Austin.

28:02.632 --> 28:04.071
Detective Sanchez, sergeant Gabriel,

28:04.111 --> 28:06.760
if there's anything even remotely
interesting in this house,

28:06.800 --> 28:08.090
I want it in the murder room.

28:08.130 --> 28:09.959
Mr Phillips.

28:11.009 --> 28:13.178
Let's go to work.

28:17.047 --> 28:18.507
Where is Mr Phillips' attorney?

28:18.547 --> 28:21.276
Mr Banks keeps calling
to say that he's close.

28:21.316 --> 28:22.646
Banks. Oh, god.

28:22.686 --> 28:26.624
And he's been close for the
last hour and 48 minutes.

28:26.954 --> 28:29.564
Assistant Chief Pope,
Deputy Chief Johnson.

28:29.604 --> 28:30.993
I'm sorry about the traffic.

28:31.033 --> 28:34.782
Even I don't take 2 hours to get
from Century City to downtown.

28:34.822 --> 28:36.941
Nice to see you again, too, Ms Johnson.

28:36.981 --> 28:41.000
–Shall we?
–Yes, sir, we shall.

28:45.909 --> 28:49.558
I'm just a little bit concerned about…

28:51.977 --> 28:54.096
about how my wife is going to take this.

28:54.136 --> 28:55.796
I mean, I know you might
not understand this,

28:55.836 --> 28:57.895
but I, um…

28:59.825 --> 29:03.194
I love her, ok? Very much.

29:03.224 --> 29:04.783
And I just want to know
if there's any kind of way

29:04.823 --> 29:07.402
that you and I could negotiate

29:07.442 --> 29:09.242
at all how this story comes out

29:09.282 --> 29:12.361
if that's at all possible.

29:12.401 --> 29:14.180
Well, how's this for a start?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.100
If we find anything in your house,

29:16.140 --> 29:17.549
which we are searching right now,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.869
that solidly proves you
committed this murder,

29:19.909 --> 29:21.648
and we do that before
you tell me what happened,

29:21.688 --> 29:23.868
the DA. will charge you
with murder in the first,

29:23.908 --> 29:25.927
and I won't need to hear
anything you have to say,

29:25.967 --> 29:28.856
so the longer you stall, the closer
you get to a lethal injection.

29:28.896 --> 29:31.495
How's that for a deal?

29:36.754 --> 29:40.463
We were sort of having
an affair, Marta and I.

29:40.503 --> 29:43.382
–Hart, don't…
–All right, I need to say this.

29:43.422 --> 29:47.671
Ok. I lost my head for a couple months.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.760
I'm sorry.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.339
We've had young girls
in the house before.

29:52.379 --> 29:57.028
I mean, Austin's
friends, hot housekeepers.

29:57.058 --> 29:58.797
It's never been a problem before.

29:58.837 --> 30:02.316
Really? Your last
housekeeper got pregnant.

30:02.346 --> 30:05.275
Where is she now?

30:05.825 --> 30:09.184
Ok. Uh…

30:09.654 --> 30:11.883
I paid Alejandro to
take her back to Mexico

30:11.923 --> 30:14.663
and I paid him to bring
Carmen and Marta over.

30:14.703 --> 30:16.392
So you've been paying Alejandro

30:16.432 --> 30:18.411
to bring young girls back
and forth across the border.

30:18.451 --> 30:21.651
No, no, no, no, no. It
was just these 2 times.

30:21.681 --> 30:24.180
And Marta was…

30:24.620 --> 30:26.779
–Was a special girl.
–Yeah.

30:26.819 --> 30:28.678
Smart and very mature.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.868
I've seen the photographs.
She looks a lot older than 13.

30:31.908 --> 30:34.857
Exactly. No, exactly.

30:34.897 --> 30:37.876
I mean, I know technically
it can't be considered

30:37.916 --> 30:39.865
a consensual relationship. I know that.

30:39.905 --> 30:43.044
But she wanted me and I wanted her.

30:43.094 --> 30:45.284
Say it. Get it over with.

30:45.324 --> 30:48.033
They always want to explain.

30:48.963 --> 30:53.511
And when was the first time you had sex?

30:54.011 --> 30:58.260
It was last Monday.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.229
Afterwards, she said that she loved me,

31:02.269 --> 31:06.507
and when I didn't reciprocate
or say anything back to her,

31:06.537 --> 31:08.547
she got really upset.

31:08.587 --> 31:12.146
She, uh… I went to hold her,

31:12.186 --> 31:15.255
but she pulled away and…

31:15.385 --> 31:16.604
she slipped on the steps.

31:16.644 --> 31:20.163
This entire thing was
just a complete accident.

31:20.213 --> 31:21.663
Ok.

31:21.693 --> 31:23.872
So why didn't you call an
ambulance or the police?

31:23.912 --> 31:26.721
I panicked, all right?

31:26.761 --> 31:29.361
I wasn't thinking clearly.

31:29.391 --> 31:31.270
She was just completely still.

31:31.310 --> 31:34.859
She was just… she was limp.

31:34.879 --> 31:37.168
So I…

31:37.198 --> 31:41.197
put her in my car, took
her to the L. A. river

31:41.227 --> 31:43.037
and I figured she would
just float away, you know?

31:43.077 --> 31:45.696
Right out to sea.

31:48.895 --> 31:55.283
The autopsy report says she regained
consciousness when she hit the water.

31:55.753 --> 31:57.802
Yeah.

31:58.082 --> 32:01.171
She started screaming…

32:01.481 --> 32:06.420
and I was surprised, but I had
rolled her in from way up on the bank

32:06.450 --> 32:09.759
and I couldn't get down
to her before she drowned.

32:09.799 --> 32:12.778
It was awful.

32:13.488 --> 32:17.956
Mr Banks, if I find out you
have knowingly participated

32:17.986 --> 32:21.515
in delaying this interview…

32:29.073 --> 32:32.202
What the hell was that all about?

32:32.362 --> 32:34.022
Thank you.

32:34.142 --> 32:35.911
I've alerted the DA. they're
sending somebody right over.

32:35.951 --> 32:38.560
Well, you can unalert them,
because Marta Alvarez didn't drown.

32:38.600 --> 32:40.500
She was dead when she hit the water.

32:40.540 --> 32:41.819
Is this about the Alejandro guy?

32:41.859 --> 32:43.749
He's not covering for a gardener.

32:43.789 --> 32:45.598
Yes, sergeant Gabriel.

32:45.658 --> 32:49.197
How long ago did Leslie leave?

32:49.237 --> 32:51.126
Stop what you're doing,
bring the boy's car downtown,

32:51.166 --> 32:52.786
and find me Austin Phillips.

32:52.826 --> 32:56.720
He kept us all sitting here
so he could let his son escape.

33:04.207 --> 33:06.468
Leslie Phillips borrowed
her neighbor's vehicle

33:06.508 --> 33:09.270
and used her credit
card toward a car at LAX.

33:09.310 --> 33:11.451
Spread the number on those
plates around the globe.

33:11.491 --> 33:12.602
And 37 minutes ago,

33:12.642 --> 33:15.343
she checked her home
phone from a 619 area code.

33:15.383 --> 33:17.274
San Diego. Any guesses
where they're heading?

33:17.314 --> 33:19.085
Sea World?

33:19.145 --> 33:20.726
Lieutenant Tao, can you call bor…

33:20.766 --> 33:22.227
I'm calling border patrol right now.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.338
–Chief?
–Yes.

33:23.378 --> 33:26.379
We've got some stuff here you
are gonna want to take a look at.

33:26.419 --> 33:28.420
All right. Let's do it in the office.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.692
The kid went on-line
after killing the girl

33:30.732 --> 33:33.533
and checked out the county
sex offender website himself.

33:33.573 --> 33:35.644
He had Wayne Mathers picked out
we even arrived on the scene.

33:35.684 --> 33:37.395
Oh, good grief.

33:37.415 --> 33:38.186
Plus…

33:38.216 --> 33:42.698
Plus we got this out of
the back of Austin's car.

33:42.738 --> 33:47.151
This end here, it seems
to match up perfectly.

33:47.171 --> 33:49.332
We got S. I. D working
the trunk right now.

33:49.372 --> 33:51.633
Thank you, gentlemen.

33:57.867 --> 34:00.508
I never arrested an attorney
before, but you'll be my first.

34:00.548 --> 34:01.709
I had nothing to do with this.

34:01.749 --> 34:03.410
I only took my time because Hart told me

34:03.450 --> 34:04.861
he needed a couple
hours to compose himself.

34:04.901 --> 34:07.572
You mean compose one hell
of a false confession.

34:07.612 --> 34:09.523
You better convince Austin
to come home, Mr Phillips,

34:09.563 --> 34:11.004
or you and I are gonna
have big problems.

34:11.043 --> 34:13.415
Given my son's age,

34:13.475 --> 34:15.096
given the special circumstance of rape,

34:15.136 --> 34:17.918
the DA. is gonna move
to try him as an adult.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.559
You know that's true.

34:20.619 --> 34:24.541
He'll spend the rest of his
life in jail, without parole.

34:24.572 --> 34:27.833
Mexico won't extradite Austin

34:27.873 --> 34:30.155
unless you agree to try
him as a minor, period.

34:30.195 --> 34:32.735
You can't touch him now.

34:32.775 --> 34:35.487
Congratulations, Mr Phillips.

34:35.527 --> 34:38.529
You've taken exploiting
Mexico to a whole new level.

34:38.569 --> 34:41.041
My son made a terrible mistake,

34:41.071 --> 34:43.512
but he is a juvenile.

34:43.552 --> 34:45.373
If the DA. will recognize that,

34:45.413 --> 34:48.804
I'll see to it that he
returns and serves the maximum.

34:48.844 --> 34:50.556
And walks out of detention when he's 25?

34:50.596 --> 34:52.187
I don't think anyone's
gonna agree to that.

34:52.226 --> 34:55.469
Well, I'm sorry, Ms
Johnson. Those are my terms.

34:55.498 --> 34:58.040
We'll see about that.

34:58.230 --> 34:59.401
If I were you, Mr Phillips,

34:59.441 --> 35:01.462
I would stop worrying about
what we might do to your son

35:01.502 --> 35:07.245
and spend a little time considering
what I'm gonna do to you.

35:13.098 --> 35:15.210
Leslie Phillips used her credit card

35:15.250 --> 35:18.491
to check into a resort in Ensenada.

35:18.511 --> 35:20.022
You've got friends in low places.

35:20.062 --> 35:21.943
Do you mind talking to
the mexican federales,

35:21.983 --> 35:24.205
see if they'll hold them
there so I can talk to Austin?

35:24.245 --> 35:27.146
Mexico will not extradite a
minor to face a life sentence.

35:27.186 --> 35:31.659
I'm planning on having a discussion
with him about coming back to America.

35:31.699 --> 35:33.560
Brenda, eliciting
confessions is one thing.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.751
Convincing a 17-year-old
to leave the beach

35:35.791 --> 35:38.032
for life in prison I think is another.

35:38.072 --> 35:42.174
Maybe I have more faith in
my abilities than you do.

35:43.815 --> 35:47.818
Well, I guess nobody
can blame you for trying.

35:49.228 --> 35:54.751
The federales can be a bit
fickle with the L. A. P. D

35:55.492 --> 35:59.624
These might come in handy if they
decide to stop being cooperative.

35:59.664 --> 36:01.685
Well, thank you.

36:01.745 --> 36:05.007
Leave a better record with the FBI.

36:05.888 --> 36:10.280
Well, I guess you won't
be needing a escort, then.

36:10.330 --> 36:12.761
No, thanks.

36:13.032 --> 36:14.973
I have one.

36:15.633 --> 36:17.385
Thank you.

36:33.337 --> 36:34.236
Where's my lawyer?

36:34.276 --> 36:36.984
Never been to Mexico
before. Kind of cozy.

36:37.024 --> 36:38.553
Where's my lawyer?

36:38.593 --> 36:40.321
You're not in the United States anymore,

36:40.361 --> 36:42.030
so you don't have the right to a lawyer

36:42.070 --> 36:44.817
and you don't have the
right to remain silent.

36:44.857 --> 36:48.305
Austin Phillips, this is special
agent Fritz Howard of the FBI.

36:48.345 --> 36:50.293
Charmed.

36:50.343 --> 36:52.791
You can't arrest me here.

36:52.841 --> 36:55.099
Now why would I want to arrest you?

36:55.139 --> 36:57.137
Your father already
confessed to the murder.

36:57.177 --> 36:59.565
Saved us the aggravation
of a trial, too,

36:59.605 --> 37:01.693
so he'll probably be
spared the death penalty.

37:01.733 --> 37:06.949
I just wanted you to know that
it's ok for you to come home.

37:08.178 --> 37:09.257
Nice try.

37:09.297 --> 37:11.525
Mom spoke to Mr Banks.
We know what's going on.

37:11.565 --> 37:14.123
You can't trick me into anything, ok?

37:14.143 --> 37:15.412
I'm not an idiot.

37:15.442 --> 37:17.231
Well, then, how about a little trade?

37:17.271 --> 37:20.288
You come back to the States and
I won't extradite your mother.

37:20.328 --> 37:21.137
My mom?

37:21.177 --> 37:23.046
When we leave the room,

37:23.076 --> 37:25.034
I'm gonna file this warrant
to the mexican government

37:25.074 --> 37:26.843
against your mother
for aiding and abetting

37:26.883 --> 37:29.441
the flight of a criminal
across international borders.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.878
Then she'll have to serve
a little time in Mexico,

37:31.918 --> 37:34.386
but if she survives that,

37:34.416 --> 37:38.763
she'll go on to spend about
15 years in American prison.

37:39.063 --> 37:40.481
And then there's your father.

37:40.521 --> 37:41.521
What about him?

37:41.561 --> 37:42.730
Well, he made a false confession,

37:42.770 --> 37:45.447
and he helped plan your
escape with your mother,

37:45.487 --> 37:47.486
which makes him an
accessory after the fact

37:47.526 --> 37:49.804
to the rape and murder of Marta Alvarez,

37:49.844 --> 37:52.392
with an obstruction of
justice charge thrown in

37:52.432 --> 37:53.670
just to make sure that he never sees

37:53.710 --> 37:56.468
another day of freedom in his life.

37:56.498 --> 37:58.456
Or you could come home with me.

37:58.496 --> 38:01.664
–You go to hell!
–Hey, sit down!

38:02.323 --> 38:04.402
Mexico won't be much
fun without an allowance.

38:04.442 --> 38:05.780
What are you gonna do
without your parents around

38:05.820 --> 38:07.289
to give you checks and cash?

38:07.329 --> 38:09.098
–There's plenty of money.
–Actually, there isn't.

38:09.138 --> 38:11.166
We've already frozen
your family's assets.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.944
You just try to use an ATM.

38:12.984 --> 38:15.702
No cash, no parents, no hotel.

38:15.732 --> 38:18.800
You know, there's a
significant difference

38:18.830 --> 38:22.487
between visiting a
beach and living on one.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.415
You listen to me.

38:24.465 --> 38:27.562
I'm not leaving, ok?

38:27.612 --> 38:30.070
I'm not leaving. Do you
get that? I'm not leaving.

38:30.110 --> 38:32.658
Whatever you say, whatever
you do, it doesn't matter.

38:32.698 --> 38:34.766
There's nothing you can do
to make me change my mind.

38:34.806 --> 38:38.793
All right, then. Stay,
you little bastard.

38:46.876 --> 38:50.224
All right, look. I
have to close this case.

38:50.254 --> 38:52.901
You tell me the truth about what happened
and I'll let your parents go free.

38:52.941 --> 38:54.710
–Brenda, you can't do that.
–I can.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.119
The FBI might have a problem with that.

38:56.159 --> 39:00.485
We will not bring charges, and
your warrant depends upon ours.

39:00.515 --> 39:06.170
Brenda, think about what you're doing.

39:09.038 --> 39:11.666
Please, Fritz.

39:14.294 --> 39:17.461
This is a mistake.

39:21.228 --> 39:23.276
You tell me the truth
about what happened,

39:23.316 --> 39:27.583
you can sit here and
your parents go free.

39:29.421 --> 39:32.009
And you'll unfreeze the assets?

39:32.069 --> 39:35.856
Yes. I'll unfreeze their assets.

39:36.635 --> 39:39.423
But I want to hear the truth.

39:39.533 --> 39:41.771
I want to hear it.

39:44.689 --> 39:45.858
Are you into little girls?

39:45.898 --> 39:50.114
No. No! I messed around with our
last housekeeper and she was 19.

39:50.154 --> 39:51.653
Marta was into me.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.281
She was always coming into my room,

39:53.321 --> 39:56.239
sitting on my bed, watching me.

39:56.269 --> 40:00.366
Giggling. You know how they are.

40:00.396 --> 40:03.573
And then last week, she told me
she wanted to be my girlfriend.

40:03.613 --> 40:05.281
Did you want to be her boyfriend?

40:05.321 --> 40:07.270
No.

40:08.899 --> 40:10.607
But, you know, she was hot.

40:10.647 --> 40:12.446
And so I explained to her

40:12.476 --> 40:14.644
what it would take to be my girlfriend

40:14.684 --> 40:16.532
and how she could do it.

40:16.562 --> 40:18.401
She was excited by it, ok?

40:18.441 --> 40:19.939
She was looking forward to it and,

40:19.979 --> 40:22.847
I thought, I have a little experience.

40:22.877 --> 40:24.945
A lot of guys don't, you know.

40:24.975 --> 40:26.674
But you ended up hurting her.

40:26.714 --> 40:28.542
I guess.

40:28.572 --> 40:29.861
She said she wanted to stop,

40:29.901 --> 40:32.179
–but…
–But what?

40:32.209 --> 40:34.208
But I told her

40:34.238 --> 40:36.506
that this is what it
meant to be my girlfriend

40:36.546 --> 40:38.014
and that she couldn't go back now

40:38.054 --> 40:39.343
because she'd already agreed to it,

40:39.383 --> 40:41.165
and you know, she couldn't.

40:41.192 --> 40:43.200
And I even tried to talk
her all the way through it.

40:43.240 --> 40:44.839
I tried to help her.

40:44.869 --> 40:46.967
But then, when we got all
done, she got all weird.

40:47.007 --> 40:49.215
–Weird how?
–All quiet and stuff.

40:49.255 --> 40:51.273
But we had to move it.

40:51.303 --> 40:53.462
We were in my father's study

40:53.492 --> 40:56.299
and my mom would be home soon.

40:56.329 --> 40:59.387
And then she started to cry…

40:59.447 --> 41:00.955
So I held her and she pushed me away,

41:00.995 --> 41:04.093
so I told her she had to go.

41:04.313 --> 41:07.170
She had to put her
panties back on and go.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.659
And then she tried to run

41:08.699 --> 41:10.418
and she said that she
was gonna tell everyone

41:10.458 --> 41:15.893
and… and… you know, she fell.

41:15.933 --> 41:17.941
–You pushed her.
–No!

41:17.991 --> 41:20.639
No. No, I didn't…

41:20.699 --> 41:23.407
We were… we were struggling.

41:23.437 --> 41:26.264
I was trying to get her downstairs.

41:28.822 --> 41:31.900
It was an accident.

41:32.289 --> 41:33.668
But it wasn't an accident

41:33.708 --> 41:36.006
that you went on-line to
find a list of sex offenders

41:36.046 --> 41:38.284
to find a pedophile you could blame.

41:38.324 --> 41:40.423
It's not an accident that
Wayne Mathers is now dead

41:40.463 --> 41:43.240
because he couldn't take being
falsely accused one more time,

41:43.280 --> 41:46.218
and it's no accident that you dumped
Marta's body in the L. A. river,

41:46.258 --> 41:49.086
and it's no accident
that we found her DNA

41:49.126 --> 41:51.164
in the trunk of your car,

41:51.214 --> 41:54.021
all of which I have evidence to prove.

41:54.051 --> 41:56.799
Great. Good for you. Now you can leave.

41:56.839 --> 42:00.386
And now you can stay.

42:05.462 --> 42:07.470
My…

42:07.670 --> 42:11.837
spanish is not as good as your english,

42:11.877 --> 42:14.445
but I believe that that
is a birth certificate

42:14.485 --> 42:16.753
for Marta Alvarez, am I right?

42:16.783 --> 42:18.651
–Si, senora.
–Carmen gave it to me.

42:18.691 --> 42:22.908
It shows that Marta was born in Mexico.

42:22.948 --> 42:24.526
Just your bad luck, I guess,

42:24.566 --> 42:26.714
that you sought sanctuary in
the country of your victim,

42:26.754 --> 42:30.211
because, you see, these gentlemen,
they just don't take too kindly

42:30.251 --> 42:31.930
to their citizens being murdered,

42:31.970 --> 42:34.668
no matter where in the world it happens.

42:34.708 --> 42:36.386
And since you killed a mexican national

42:36.426 --> 42:38.165
and you won't come home with me,

42:38.205 --> 42:40.253
you can be tried here for your crime

42:40.293 --> 42:44.540
and spend the next 40
years in a mexican prison.

42:45.349 --> 42:46.318
Gentlemen.

42:46.358 --> 42:49.745
Mom! Mom! Mom, help me!

42:50.215 --> 42:52.153
Help me!

42:55.281 --> 42:57.978
I'll go with her! I'll go
with you! Take me with you!

42:58.018 --> 43:03.394
It's too late, Austin. We
already agreed to everything.

43:03.794 --> 43:05.173
You…

43:08.070 --> 43:10.158
What are you doing?
Where are you taking him?

43:10.198 --> 43:11.747
What are you doing?

43:11.767 --> 43:12.766
Where are you taking him?

43:12.806 --> 43:14.275
–Where are you taking him?
–Mom!

43:14.315 --> 43:16.393
Give me back my boy!

43:26.656 --> 43:29.173
Are you ok?

43:33.078 --> 43:35.924
I take it that means I'm driving.

43:36.024 --> 43:38.551
Yes. Thank you.

43:38.601 --> 43:40.168
And you were very, very helpful.

43:40.208 --> 43:42.276
I appreciate it.

43:42.316 --> 43:45.142
I'm just too disgusted.

43:47.030 --> 43:49.876
Why don't you go easy on that stuff?

43:49.946 --> 43:51.873
They say not to drink the water.

43:51.913 --> 43:58.155
Yeah, well, there are
other alternatives.

44:01.551 --> 44:04.487
Maybe we should stay the night.

44:06.574 --> 44:09.890
Maybe we should.

44:10.010 --> 44:13.276
Maybe that's a good idea.

44:17.011 --> 44:22.643
I just have to take
care of one thing first.

44:22.673 --> 44:24.125
–What's that?
–Just a…

44:24.162 --> 44:26.818
Just a little thing.

44:26.868 --> 44:28.995
Hey, it's no problem, chief.

44:29.025 --> 44:30.813
I'll just find their bowls or whatever

44:30.853 --> 44:33.330
and you can just relax about it.

44:33.360 --> 44:36.056
No. I don't think you're trying
to take advantage of anything.

44:36.096 --> 44:39.472
I think you might want to
eat a little something…

44:39.512 --> 44:41.918
and plan on sleeping in tomorrow.

44:41.958 --> 44:44.955
No, no, no. I'll take care of Kitty.

44:44.985 --> 44:47.092
Ok. Yeah.

44:49.968 --> 44:51.626
Oh, ok.

44:51.666 --> 44:54.083
Well, you be careful, ma'am.

44:54.123 --> 44:58.048
I'll be careful, too. Ok. All right.

44:58.098 --> 45:00.854
Bye-bye now.

45:05.458 --> 45:07.922
That is not a litter box!
