21:19.987 --> 21:23.323
[chuckles] Because the mall
is on the other side of the bridge, baby.

21:23.407 --> 21:24.825
-[siren blares]
-Damn it.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.745
Just stay still
and don't say a word, honey.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.293
Evening, Officer.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.962
[Officer Glanney]
You're far from home. You lost?

21:37.045 --> 21:40.007
No, we just went to see Santa Claus
at the mall.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.134
I'm Alderman Roosevelt, by the way.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.844
[Officer Glanney] Alderman Roosevelt?

21:43.927 --> 21:46.221
What is that,
some kind of Duke Ellington shit?

21:46.305 --> 21:50.642
No. I'm a city alderman.
I represent the Twelfth Ward.

21:50.726 --> 21:54.479
[Officer Glanney]
Well, this is the First Ward, Alderman.

21:54.563 --> 21:58.066
Come on, man. We really gonna do this?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.901
[Officer Glanney]
Wanna step out of the car, big man?

21:59.985 --> 22:02.029
-[groans]
-[door opens]

22:04.364 --> 22:06.158
[Officer Glanney] Hands on the trunk.

22:06.241 --> 22:10.412
I know the drill.
Just like the last 15 times.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.623
[Officer O'Rourke] Well, here's a twist,
sit on the curb.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.049
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

22:24.593 --> 22:27.220
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

22:29.598 --> 22:33.643
[Officer Glanney] Mayor Tangenti told us
to send you his regards.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.645
[man on radio] Yeah, I'm, uh, downtown.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.151
[groans]

22:46.865 --> 22:48.158
It's okay, honey.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.535
Let's go home.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.120
[engine starts]

22:55.791 --> 22:58.752
[laughs] Tangenti's gonna love us.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.213
Bill, that's how you make captain.

23:01.296 --> 23:03.215
All right, let's get Billy home.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.425

I got to run to the airport and go over
things for Buster Thunder's jump tomorrow.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.037
I know. You told me. It's fine.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.539
Is it really?

Or is this one of these times
where you say, "It's fine,"

you won't let me sleep in the bed?

You know what? You know...
You know what? You know what?

24:32.512 --> 24:37.184
Like I said, I don't know what,
but I am dying to find out!

24:37.267 --> 24:40.812
Guys, guys, I'm so sorry,
but I'm needed at the airport.

24:40.896 --> 24:44.274
Your old man is going to go meet
Buster Thunder.

24:44.357 --> 24:46.943
Junior? He's the coolest!

24:47.027 --> 24:51.114
You're leaving your mother
who came all the way from California?

24:51.198 --> 24:54.826
Well, I guess that airport
spent all day giving birth to you

24:54.910 --> 24:58.371
with a fourth-degree tear
from that giant head of yours.

24:58.455 --> 25:01.374
Fourth-degree? Ha! You had it easy!

25:01.458 --> 25:04.085
I put my mommy in a coma.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.962
Mom, I got to go. I'm an important man.

25:06.046 --> 25:08.840
Oh, you're acting
just like your father right now.

25:08.924 --> 25:13.803
He used to leave on Christmas too,
because he was an important man.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.764
"The Polio King."

25:15.847 --> 25:17.140
I had polio.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.725
Hey, you leave Dad alone.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.561
I'm not gonna stand here
and listen to you tear him down.

25:21.645 --> 25:25.440
You hated your father! Are you forgetting
he beat you with a crutch?

25:25.524 --> 25:28.318
Just that once!
Rest of the time he used a belt.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.778
Why are you defending him?

25:29.861 --> 25:33.406
Okay, yeah.
He was a real son of a bitch to me.

25:33.490 --> 25:37.285
But he spent his last minutes on Earth
trying to set things right between us.

25:37.827 --> 25:39.412
He was finally looking out for me.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.624
He was telling me
that a man's work gives him purpose.

25:42.707 --> 25:44.793
So I'm going to the airport now.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.920
That's my purpose, Mom!

25:47.003 --> 25:51.258
You're gonna just leave your kids
on the third holiest night of the year?

25:51.341 --> 25:52.717
-I don't care.
-We want him to go.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.094
Yeah, he's a time bomb.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.929
See, Ma? They get me!

25:57.013 --> 25:58.765
Merry fucking Christmas.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.853
I am so glad I came.

26:06.439 --> 26:08.900
-[both moaning]
-Ah! Jesus Christ!

26:08.984 --> 26:13.029
Frank, you'll never guess
what I just discovered about myself.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.824
I kind of guessed it when I met you.
Out of my car!

26:16.491 --> 26:19.619
You know what the best part
of the pigeon is, don't you?

26:19.703 --> 26:24.457
If you say "skin" one more time,
I'll cut you open and sleep inside you.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.085
-Pogo.
-Rosie?

26:27.168 --> 26:30.338
I remember why I tried
to make this town better.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.632
I want to crush that fucking mayor.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.884
I knew you'd come around, Rosie.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.345
And you're just in time.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.848
We get our revenge tomorrow.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.808
The plan is all laid out.

26:41.891 --> 26:44.144
Count me in. What are we doing?

26:44.227 --> 26:47.856
Tomorrow, when Buster Thunder
jumps that airplane,

26:47.939 --> 26:51.234
we're gonna use his national TV audience

26:51.318 --> 26:56.823
to present evidence that will take
the mayor and Gagliardi down.

26:56.906 --> 26:59.784
That's amazing! Evidence from who?

26:59.868 --> 27:02.245
I'm Jim Jeffords, and I've got the scoop

27:02.329 --> 27:03.747
