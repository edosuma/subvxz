00:55.472 --> 00:57.391
Please.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.261
lf he makes it to the river,
he's won.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.681
We cannot allow that
to happen, Mr. Lopaki.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.320
Brandy ?

05:25.909 --> 05:27.828
lt's like a drug,
isn't it ?

05:29.872 --> 05:32.499
To bring a man down.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.174
Was it worth it ?

05:41.633 --> 05:43.719
- Every nickel.
- Good.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.862
Yes ?

06:43.946 --> 06:48.534
Hi, l'm-- l'm looking
for Douglas Binder ?

06:48.617 --> 06:52.079
- You a friend of Mr. Binder's ?
- No, l--

06:52.162 --> 06:55.165
l'm-- l'm his daughter.

06:55.207 --> 06:59.670
Doug was a nice man.
He had manners.

06:59.711 --> 07:04.216
He didn't tell you where
he was moving, did he ?

07:04.299 --> 07:07.719
He owed some rent,
honey.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.889
l told him he could
wait to pay me...

07:10.973 --> 07:14.685
- 'til he got back on his feet.
- He wasn't in an accident, was he ?

07:14.726 --> 07:18.522
Oh, no. He lost his job
with the oil tool company.

07:18.564 --> 07:20.732
When Doug moved out,

07:20.774 --> 07:24.027
he left this box.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.533
He told me l could
hold it...

07:29.575 --> 07:32.828
'til he could make up
his back rent.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.043
Do you have any idea
where he might be now ?

07:40.085 --> 07:43.547
You might try checking down
at Our Lady of Charity.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.549
Marine, huh ?

07:45.591 --> 07:47.885
Ah, Recon.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.762
- l was in the service
for a while myself.
- Really ?

07:50.846 --> 07:53.265
- Yeah.
- Do you know him ?

07:53.348 --> 07:55.767
Well, he comes here
sometimes.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.770
Nice guy too.
Uh, if l see him,

07:58.854 --> 08:01.899
l'll-- l'll tell him
you're looking.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.693
Do you happen to know
where he lives ?

08:08.989 --> 08:12.451
l-l'm afraid your--
Your daddy, uh, well--

08:12.492 --> 08:15.454
Well, he was like the rest of us:
out of doors.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.456
You know ?

08:47.903 --> 08:50.322
How is that gumbo, Chance ?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.076
A tragedy.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.119
The coffee
was tolerable, though.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.748
- lt ain't free neither.
- Yeah, l know.

08:59.832 --> 09:02.251
Leave your wallet
in your tuxedo ?

09:04.169 --> 09:06.338
l play that one
on you before ?

09:06.380 --> 09:10.968
- Yeah. For the gumbo.
- That's right.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.869
-  lf you don't want me, baby
- Hi. Do you have any change ?

09:36.952 --> 09:39.538
Baby
please tell me so

09:42.416 --> 09:46.003
-  lf you don't want me, honey
- Thank you.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.338
Honey
please let me know

09:51.133 --> 09:54.595
But if you don't
want me that bad

09:54.678 --> 09:57.890
Darlin'
please let me know

10:06.273 --> 10:08.567
Hi, Murray.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.778
Yes, l was wondering if my father
came to pick up his mail yet.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.909
He hasn't ? No, that's fine.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.259
- Hello, pretty lady.
- Leave me the hell alone.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.929
We'll take the wallet.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.765
How about a little
extra, honey ?

10:43.936 --> 10:46.438
You having fun ?

10:52.110 --> 10:56.031
Why don't you do yourself
a favor, boy ?

10:56.114 --> 11:00.410
l think the favor
gonna be done for you.

11:00.452 --> 11:03.622
lt's okay.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.625
l said get lost.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.131
Now, take your big stick
and your boyfriend...

11:13.215 --> 11:15.884
and find a bus to catch.

11:15.968 --> 11:18.595
Oh, this guy's funny.

11:53.672 --> 11:56.175
Come on, let's go !

12:23.243 --> 12:26.121
Let's go ! Come on !

12:41.053 --> 12:45.349
You know, it's a shame. This
used to be such a nice part of town.

12:49.394 --> 12:52.147
Next time be more careful
when you show your wallet.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.261
Without cops, the city stops !

13:22.302 --> 13:24.346
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:24.429 --> 13:26.431
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:26.473 --> 13:28.433
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:28.475 --> 13:30.561
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:30.602 --> 13:33.730
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:33.772 --> 13:35.983
Without cops, the city stops !

13:36.066 --> 13:39.945
- Come on, let's hurry now !
- Without cops, the city stops !

13:40.028 --> 13:41.947
- Will the strike end soon ?
- Here you go.

13:42.030 --> 13:45.075
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:45.117 --> 13:47.286
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:47.327 --> 13:49.621
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:49.663 --> 13:52.291
Without cops,
the city stops !

14:02.467 --> 14:04.928
Happy birthday to me.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.973
Excuse me.

14:18.442 --> 14:22.946
- Can l help you ?
- Yeah. l need to fill out
a missing person report.

14:22.988 --> 14:26.992
Look, l just pulled a double shift.
Why don't you catch me tomorrow.

14:28.660 --> 14:33.123
Okay.
Why don't you catch me now.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.168
- What is the name
of the missing individual ?
- Douglas Charles Binder.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.672
Relationship
of reporting party ?

14:40.714 --> 14:44.343
Daughter.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.679
- Okay. You got a picture ?
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.352 --> 14:58.190
- Got something a little more recent ?
- Oh, no, l don't.

14:58.232 --> 15:01.860
See, my parents
were divorced 20 years ago.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.822
- You got an address ?
- l think my father was homeless.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.783
l didn't even know myself...

15:07.866 --> 15:11.161
u-until l just
came down here.

15:11.203 --> 15:15.624
Look, um, l'm not sure
what you want me to do here.

15:15.707 --> 15:18.335
l want you
to take my report.

15:18.377 --> 15:20.712
Well, generally, in order
to be considered missing,

15:20.796 --> 15:23.715
you need somewhere
to be missing from.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.426
Fine.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.804
lf you're too busy
to do your job, Detective,

15:28.887 --> 15:31.515
then l'll find somebody
who isn't so busy.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.559
Look.

15:35.394 --> 15:39.189
You wanna find your father,
take my advice: canvas the missions,

15:39.231 --> 15:42.067
ask at the shelters,
but, um,

15:42.150 --> 15:44.528
get somebody who knows the city
to show you around...

15:44.570 --> 15:47.072
or l'll be filling out
one of these on you.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.660
Hey, you're welcome.

16:38.207 --> 16:42.294
All right,
pipe down and listen up.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.923
We got 12 positions this morning,
Able Seaman or better.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.218
When l call your name, come into
the office, show your papers,

16:49.301 --> 16:51.970
and you'll get your ship.

16:52.012 --> 16:55.641

17:01.647 --> 17:03.899

that you might be down here.
- Seeler, D. Master.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.488
l need to talk to you
about something.

17:09.530 --> 17:14.159
- l don't think this is a good time now.
- Walters, Nichols D.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.661
- Yeah.
- Able Seaman.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.163
How'd you, um,
like to work for me ?

17:18.247 --> 17:22.751
- l'll pay you $100 a day.
- Third Mate. Stevens, Frank G.

17:22.835 --> 17:26.839
- For doing what ?
- For $100, does it really matter ?

17:28.382 --> 17:30.592
Actually, it does.

17:30.676 --> 17:33.512
Yeah. lt does.

17:33.554 --> 17:37.182
Look, l really need you
to help me find someone.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.685
Jales, Bill. Cook.

17:39.726 --> 17:43.605
You know this city, you obviously
can take care of yourself.

17:43.689 --> 17:48.360
Boudreaux, C. Able Seaman.

17:48.402 --> 17:51.280
l would like to
help you, darling.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.658
- Looks like l'm gonna be out of town.
- Bakelman, Fats.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.244
- Way out of town.
- Able Seaman.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.246
Sorry.

18:05.294 --> 18:08.046
Chance.
Thought you got blackballed...

18:08.088 --> 18:10.132
about that thing with,
uh, Captain McDonald.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.719
- That was a big misunderstanding.
- Right.

18:13.802 --> 18:17.222
Broke his damn jaw
is what l heard.

18:17.264 --> 18:21.143
You make sure l said
a big ''hello.''

18:21.226 --> 18:23.395
Whoa. Wait a minute.

18:23.478 --> 18:25.814
Johnson says
l was reinstated.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.567
With the company.
Not with the union.

18:28.609 --> 18:31.403
You owe some dues here,
boy.

18:31.445 --> 18:35.073
- 217 bucks.
- l'll pay that off on this cruise.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.744
No. Nobody ships out if they're
in arrears, you know that.

18:38.827 --> 18:43.665
- How am l gonna pay my dues
if l can't get the job ?
- l don't make the rules, mate.

18:45.417 --> 18:49.254
Look, your ride doesn't sail
'til the end of the week.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.924
lf l can get the money,
then what ?

18:52.007 --> 18:54.218
Then l'll let you
ship out.

18:56.011 --> 18:58.430
l'll get the money.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.944
Keep goin'.
Take it back. Yeah.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.696
Bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it.

19:14.780 --> 19:16.698
Okay, down.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.807
So, this guy you're looking for,
he owes you money or something ?

19:41.849 --> 19:46.728
- He's my father.
- Okay, l change my mind.

19:46.812 --> 19:51.608
l'll help you for two days,
you'll pay me $217.

19:51.650 --> 19:54.903
lt's a deal.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.489
- You can drive.
- l...

19:57.573 --> 20:00.492
don't have
a driver's license, ma'am.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.414
So, what's your name ?

20:05.497 --> 20:08.458
Chance Boudreaux.
What's your name ?

20:08.500 --> 20:11.170
lt's Nat.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.172
Nat ?

20:13.255 --> 20:16.508
Your parents name you
for a... bug ?

20:16.592 --> 20:19.511
No, actually,
it's short for Natasha.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.847
Natasha.

20:21.930 --> 20:24.641
What kind of a name
is Chance ?

20:24.683 --> 20:28.020
Well, my mama took one.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.816
So how did you lose
your papa ?

20:35.027 --> 20:39.531
My parents, um, they got divorced
when l was seven and my father--

20:39.615 --> 20:42.034
Well, he moved away.

20:45.037 --> 20:48.957
We started to write and
he even called me a couple of times.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.127
Three weeks ago
the letters just stopped.

20:55.881 --> 20:58.884
l've got a friend here
who can help us.

20:58.926 --> 21:02.513
You check the line,
l'll look around inside.

21:11.063 --> 21:15.234
Hey, you don't have
a bottle of hot sauce on ya, do ya ?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.528
- Elijah. What's happening ?
- Hi.

21:17.569 --> 21:19.530
Wednesday meat loaf.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.949
l mean, they said
it was meat loaf.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.869
- l thought you were gonna get a ship.
- l lost my boarding pass.

21:29.081 --> 21:31.250
l've got something
to show you.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.252
You two know each other ?

21:33.335 --> 21:37.339
- We met yesterday.
Have you seen my father ?
- l saw the next best thing.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.383
l was over at
Plaza D'ltalia yesterday...

21:39.424 --> 21:42.553
and l saw this sleeping bag
in a cart.

21:42.594 --> 21:47.558
lt was a tiger stripe, like the kind
they used to issue to Recon guys.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.935
Your daddy had one
just like it.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.522
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You bet.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.665
Don't be offended.
He passed them out for money.

22:53.749 --> 22:56.960
Uh, yeah, l've had to
do it myself.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.967
Here. Barracks Street.

23:04.009 --> 23:08.680
Both sides this time, Grandpa.
Next ! Get !

23:08.722 --> 23:12.518
Here. Decatur. Lower half.

23:13.977 --> 23:17.189
Well, if it ain't
my good friend Boudreaux.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.525
l thought you was gonna
catch a ship.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.319
Maybe l'll stick around
to run for mayor.

23:22.361 --> 23:24.821
We're looking for someone
who worked for you.

23:24.863 --> 23:27.825
The man's name
is Douglas Binder.

23:27.866 --> 23:30.786
- l never heard of him.
- l think he know you.

23:30.869 --> 23:33.872
- Did he work for you, sir ?
- Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

23:33.914 --> 23:36.500
l'm not too good with names.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.635
l have a photograph.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.057
What Mr. Poe trying to say,

23:52.099 --> 23:54.977
he's not too good with faces.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.771
Right ?

23:59.398 --> 24:03.735
Hello, Randal.
l didn't know you had company.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.877
We were just leaving.

24:22.796 --> 24:27.676
- You know, we should go back up there.
- Not now. Not together.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.721
Poe knows something
about my father, obviously.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.599
lf you don't want to go back
up there, l'll go myself.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.311
lf you want to find your daddy,
you're gonna have to work smarter,

24:37.394 --> 24:39.938
not harder.

24:39.980 --> 24:41.940
Yeah.

24:46.820 --> 24:49.156
- Natasha Binder ?
- What's the problem ?

24:49.239 --> 24:51.867
l'm afraid l have
some bad news.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.952
They found
your father's body.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.980
l'm sorry.

25:22.022 --> 25:25.859
- They made a positive l.D.
- How did it happen ?

25:25.943 --> 25:30.781
There was a fire last night in
an abandoned building in the Ninth Ward.

25:30.822 --> 25:34.076
The fire department discovered
your father's body in one of the rooms.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.578
l need to see him.

25:36.662 --> 25:40.624
Your daddy was burned
pretty badly.

25:42.167 --> 25:45.003
The identification had to
be made from dental charts...

25:45.045 --> 25:47.798
in your father's
service record.

25:56.849 --> 25:59.852
What's your
involvement here ?

25:59.893 --> 26:02.271
l was helping her
find her daddy.

26:31.717 --> 26:35.971
Wakey, wakey, you fat fuck !

26:45.772 --> 26:47.733
Oh, God !

26:47.774 --> 26:49.985
Mr. Fouchon,
what are you doing here ?

26:50.068 --> 26:53.322
- Aah ! Oww !
- Don't talk, Randal. Listen.

26:53.405 --> 26:55.324
Oh, don't worry
about Randal.

26:55.407 --> 26:57.868
- Aah !
- He's all ears.

26:57.910 --> 27:01.246
When Mr. Van Cleaf came upon
your visitors yesterday,

27:01.330 --> 27:04.041
you neglected to tell him
that they were inquiring...

27:04.082 --> 27:08.253
- about one of our volunteers.
- That was nothin', Mr. Fouchon.

27:08.337 --> 27:10.422
Oh, it was something,
Randal.

27:23.519 --> 27:26.605
This man we hunted last night.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.566
Why don't you tell us his real name ?

27:29.608 --> 27:33.445
- You fuck.
- Binder. Binder. Douglas Binder.

27:33.529 --> 27:36.281
That's not the one
we selected, is it ?

27:36.365 --> 27:38.742
l-l couldn't get the guy
you asked for.

27:38.784 --> 27:42.704
Look, y-you said you wanted
a combat veteran, so l sent you Binder.

27:42.788 --> 27:46.875
- He has more medals.
- He had a family.
Now they're asking questions.

27:46.959 --> 27:49.127
Please. Please.
l said l was sorry. l sai--

27:49.211 --> 27:52.965
- Aah ! l said l was sorry.
- Careless is what you are, Randal.

27:53.048 --> 27:55.259
Careless and stupid...

27:55.300 --> 27:57.427
and now you're sorry, too.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.805
He said he--
He said he was alone.

27:59.888 --> 28:03.267
- l didn't know he had
any relatives. Honest.
- You made a mistake ?

28:03.308 --> 28:05.143
- ls that what you're saying ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:05.227 --> 28:08.105
Uh-huh. And l see you're anxious
to make up for it, aren't you ?

28:08.146 --> 28:11.275
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Yes. Yes, sir.

28:11.316 --> 28:15.654
We've got another client
and he's about to select a new playmate.

28:19.825 --> 28:22.953
Next time send us
the one we ask for.

28:22.995 --> 28:27.166
l will, Mr. Fouchon,
l swear. l--

28:28.584 --> 28:31.795
l think
we understand each other.

28:31.837 --> 28:35.591
- Yes ? No ?
- Yes. Yeah.

28:35.674 --> 28:37.634
Randal.

28:37.676 --> 28:40.470
l come back here,

28:40.512 --> 28:42.472
l cut me a steak.

28:47.853 --> 28:49.813
You did your best.

28:49.855 --> 28:52.357
No, l--
l came too late.

28:52.441 --> 28:56.028
l mean, Jesus, he was living
out of a shopping cart.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.989
Goddamn it.

28:59.031 --> 29:02.075
Why didn't he just...
tell me ?

29:02.159 --> 29:04.786
Why didn't he ask
for my help ?

29:04.870 --> 29:08.707
l've been there myself
on the street.

29:08.749 --> 29:11.251
lt's hard.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.253
lt's hard to...

29:13.337 --> 29:15.380
put your hand out.

29:15.422 --> 29:18.258
l just kept thinking
if l could...

29:21.053 --> 29:24.014
just tell him
that l loved him.

29:25.891 --> 29:29.478
And because
he loved you so much,

29:29.561 --> 29:32.356
he didn't want to
pull you into it.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.906
- Our friend, Mr. Boudreaux.
- Mm-hmm.

29:42.324 --> 29:44.201
Silver Star.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.203
Marine Force Recon.

29:46.245 --> 29:49.081
He joined
the Merchant Service after he got out.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.375
His captain
was smuggling opium.

29:51.416 --> 29:55.170
When Boudreaux found out,
he threw the man overboard.

29:55.254 --> 29:57.756
He's been looking
for work ever since.

29:57.798 --> 30:01.385
He's obviously not someone
we should underestimate.

30:01.426 --> 30:04.721
He was raised
in the bayous by his uncle.

30:04.763 --> 30:07.057
l think Mr. Boudreaux...

30:07.099 --> 30:09.768
would make
a very interesting quarry.

30:11.311 --> 30:14.439
Maybe l should, uh,
pay him a visit.

30:14.523 --> 30:16.441
No, no, no, no, no.

30:16.525 --> 30:20.237
Send a couple of lads down there
to have a chat with him.

30:20.279 --> 30:22.239
Yeah.

31:09.077 --> 31:11.163
Yeah.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.047
Bingo.

32:35.164 --> 32:38.542
Some friendly advice, Boudreaux:
Get the fuck outta Dodge !

32:38.584 --> 32:41.712
Do it today ! And tell
that bitch girlfriend of yours...

32:41.753 --> 32:44.673
to point her titties north
and step on the gas !

32:52.431 --> 32:54.766
lt's always
nice to see you.

32:54.808 --> 32:57.227
You seem to have a real talent,
Mr. Boudreaux,

32:57.269 --> 32:59.271
for attracting violence.

32:59.354 --> 33:01.773
Does that make me
a bad person ?

33:03.108 --> 33:05.068
Why did you arrest me for,

33:05.110 --> 33:07.779
getting beat up
without a license ?

33:07.863 --> 33:11.783
Thank you for calling me.
Oh, my God, you look awful.

33:11.825 --> 33:14.244
Darling,
you hurt my feelings.

33:14.286 --> 33:16.788
What we have here is a charge sheet.

33:16.830 --> 33:20.375
Willfully crossing a police barrier;
that's considered Criminal Trespass.

33:20.459 --> 33:23.629
Yes, that officer was nice enough
to mention that to me.

33:23.712 --> 33:26.215
- What were you doing at the house ?
- The dog tag...

33:26.298 --> 33:28.759
you find in that fire ?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.761
They always come in twos.

33:30.802 --> 33:33.972
So l went back to that place
to look for the other one.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.977
Your daddy,
he didn't die in the fire.

33:40.521 --> 33:43.482
- He was murdered.
- There's no evidence of that.

33:43.565 --> 33:45.651
There is now.

33:47.694 --> 33:51.907
That hole in that tag was made
by something sharp and hard.

33:51.990 --> 33:54.660
And l'll bet my rent money
it was made...

33:54.701 --> 33:57.621
when Binder
was still wearing it.

33:57.663 --> 34:01.250
Why would somebody go through all
this trouble to kill a homeless man ?

34:01.333 --> 34:05.295
- Do you believe us now ?
- The wheels turn slow around here.

34:05.337 --> 34:07.965
- Real slow.
- But they do turn.

34:11.176 --> 34:13.679
l'll order a new autopsy.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.681
This'll help.

34:23.897 --> 34:27.359
- You should see a doctor.
- l hate them doctors.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.561
Yeah-- Aah ! Shit !

35:02.603 --> 35:04.563
Goddamn it.

35:05.689 --> 35:09.151
What ? Not now.

35:18.410 --> 35:21.038
So-- So, you in 'Nam ?

35:21.079 --> 35:23.665
Yeah,
a long time ago.

35:23.749 --> 35:25.876
lt seems to me a man with
your obvious experience...

35:25.918 --> 35:27.878
should be pullin' down
a lot more money.

35:31.089 --> 35:34.426
You're gonna pay me 100 bucks
to fill out a form ?

35:34.468 --> 35:37.387
l'll pay you a lot more than that
if you got the experience.

35:41.767 --> 35:44.394
What kind of experience ?

35:44.436 --> 35:46.605
Well, maybe you ain't interested.

35:46.647 --> 35:49.274
Uh, no.

35:49.358 --> 35:51.777
l'll fill out
the application.

35:51.819 --> 35:54.571
You got any family ?
Anybody to worry about you ?

35:54.613 --> 35:56.615
Friends ?
Anything like that ?

35:56.698 --> 35:59.117
l got nobody.

36:16.802 --> 36:20.472
You'll deposit
$500,000 in our account...

36:20.514 --> 36:22.474
in a bank
in the Cayman lslands.

36:22.516 --> 36:25.644
Do not refer to
our agreement by telex...

36:25.727 --> 36:27.646
or in conversations
on the phone.

36:29.731 --> 36:32.651
You'll be provided
with a guide, trackers...

36:32.734 --> 36:35.070
and the weapon
of your choice.

36:35.154 --> 36:37.531
Naturally, we will
dispose of the body...

36:37.614 --> 36:42.077
and provide you with
an out-of-town, airtight alibi.

36:42.161 --> 36:46.039
Don't worry, Mr. Zenan, all you
have to do is point and shoot.

36:54.339 --> 36:57.467
Mr. Zenan has made his selection.

36:57.509 --> 37:01.805
A black man named Roper.
Used to be in Special Forces.

37:01.847 --> 37:03.932
Excellent.

37:04.016 --> 37:06.476
l don't see any problem
with your choice.

37:06.518 --> 37:09.104
lt has always been
the privilege of the few...

37:09.188 --> 37:11.106
to hunt the many.

37:11.190 --> 37:15.527
Soldiers, policemen,
fighter pilots.

37:15.611 --> 37:18.489
Men who kill for the government
do so with impunity.

37:18.530 --> 37:20.699
All we do is offer
the same opportunity...

37:20.741 --> 37:23.035
for private citizens
such as yourself.

37:23.118 --> 37:27.456
- These opponents, they're volunteers ?
- More or less.

37:27.539 --> 37:30.334
The same government that has
made murder their sole preserve,

37:30.375 --> 37:32.336
they train our targets.

37:32.377 --> 37:35.672
We pride ourselves
on only hunting combat veterans,

37:35.714 --> 37:37.799
men who have
the necessary skills...

37:37.883 --> 37:41.553
- to make our hunts more interesting.
- What about the police ?

37:41.595 --> 37:44.473
l'm sure that they would be interested
if they were to find out.

37:44.556 --> 37:47.017
Dr. Morton here
assists us...

37:47.059 --> 37:49.978
with the formality
of police autopsies.

37:50.062 --> 37:52.564
lt's no accident
that we're in New Orleans.

37:52.648 --> 37:56.235
Last year we conducted hunts
in Rio de Janeiro at Carnival,

37:56.318 --> 37:58.654
Yugoslavia during
the late unpleasantness.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.823
Oh, yeah.

38:00.906 --> 38:05.077
You see, there's always some unhappy
little corner of the planet...

38:05.160 --> 38:07.788
where we can ply our trade.

38:07.871 --> 38:09.790
All right, Mr. Fouchon.

38:11.583 --> 38:15.087
- You have a client.
- Well,

38:15.170 --> 38:17.923
thank you for visiting,
Mr. Zenan.

38:18.006 --> 38:20.425
Dr. Morton will
show you to the car.

38:20.509 --> 38:23.262
My bank will arrange
the transfer of funds within the hour.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.597
- Excellent.
- When do we go out ?

38:25.639 --> 38:29.268
We'll contact you when the
necessary arrangements have been made.

38:37.985 --> 38:41.238
Chance. What you doing here ?

38:41.280 --> 38:44.616
- Secret mission.
- Mmmm.

38:44.658 --> 38:48.620
Rub me, baby.

39:05.846 --> 39:08.140
Oh, yeah, baby.

39:08.182 --> 39:10.893
Hello, Poe.

39:10.976 --> 39:13.937
What the fuck ?

39:13.979 --> 39:16.899
- You miss me ?
- Aw, Christ, not again.

39:16.982 --> 39:19.026
Looks like you're short
an ear,

39:19.109 --> 39:21.820
so you better listen
very carefully.

39:21.904 --> 39:26.575
- Now, are you paying attention ?
- Uh-huh.

39:26.658 --> 39:28.744
Who sent those apes
after me ?

39:28.827 --> 39:30.913
l don't know
what you're talking about.

39:33.081 --> 39:35.167
Two million people
in this city.

39:35.209 --> 39:38.837
- Who's gonna miss a fat
slob like you, Poe, huh ?
- Van Cleaf !

39:38.921 --> 39:40.839
H-His name was Van Cleaf.

39:40.923 --> 39:42.966
Good boy.
Where is he ?

39:43.008 --> 39:46.512
l don't know where he lives !
He ain't even American !

39:46.595 --> 39:49.473
Look, he'll-- He'll kill me
if l don't do what he says !

39:49.515 --> 39:51.892
You gotta believe that !
Aaah !

39:51.975 --> 39:54.436
Tell your boyfriend
Van Cleaf...

39:54.520 --> 39:57.981
l'm gonna find out who
killed Douglas Binder.

39:58.023 --> 40:01.318
lf you understand me,
just grunt.

40:03.362 --> 40:06.365
Again.

40:18.585 --> 40:22.548
Did you get my memo ?

40:22.589 --> 40:25.467
Binder, Douglas C.

40:25.551 --> 40:28.470
l want you to take another look
at the post-mortem.

40:29.972 --> 40:33.809
That memo contains evidence...

40:33.892 --> 40:37.563
that might make
Binder's death a homicide.

40:37.646 --> 40:40.899
Now, you can act on it, Doctor,
or you can file it,

40:40.941 --> 40:44.695
but if l have to get a court order
for a formal inquest,

40:44.736 --> 40:47.239
l will.

41:01.503 --> 41:03.755
You should do something
about that cough.

41:03.839 --> 41:07.885
Don't you ever knock ?

41:16.768 --> 41:20.939
We have a problem.
A big problem.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.692
They want me to redo
the autopsy on Binder.

41:27.279 --> 41:31.283
- Who is it that's asking ?
- A detective named Mitchell.

41:31.366 --> 41:33.785
Binder's family's
breathing down her neck.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.248
- Can we buy her ?
- No.

41:44.796 --> 41:47.633
l guess we've overstayed
our welcome.

41:51.303 --> 41:53.972
Tonight is our last hunt
in New Orleans.

42:00.979 --> 42:03.482
Open it.

42:35.138 --> 42:37.558
What a funny
little man, eh ?

42:37.641 --> 42:40.519
A change of scenery's what we need.
Something less tropical.

42:42.271 --> 42:44.273
Rolling hills, castles.

42:46.316 --> 42:48.694
Eastern Europe.
We can work there for years.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.818
- Where's Poe ?
- Mr. Poe couldn't make it.

43:29.902 --> 43:31.820
He's got an ear infection.

43:34.990 --> 43:37.868
Look, he, uh, he said
he'd have some work for me.

43:37.910 --> 43:40.829
That may still be
a possibility.

43:42.414 --> 43:45.667
We got a little game
we'd like you to play with us.

43:48.420 --> 43:50.547
This money belt...

43:50.589 --> 43:53.425
has $10,000 in it.

43:53.509 --> 43:56.553
lt's all yours if you want it,
every penny.

43:57.596 --> 44:00.015
What do l have to do ?

44:00.098 --> 44:03.060
The rules of the game
are very simple.

44:03.101 --> 44:06.772
All you have to do is get to the river.
Ten miles through the city.

44:06.855 --> 44:11.360
You and the money belt make it
to the river, you're $10,000 richer.

44:11.443 --> 44:13.362
Bullshit.

44:14.530 --> 44:16.824
Maybe you like being
the object of pity,

44:16.907 --> 44:20.035
begging for quarters,
sleeping in the rain,

44:20.118 --> 44:22.538
listening to a half an hour
of fire and brimstone...

44:22.621 --> 44:25.958
- for a bowl of soup.
- Man, fuck you.

44:25.999 --> 44:28.210
You could change everything
tonight.

44:28.293 --> 44:31.922
Think of what $10,000
could buy you.

44:31.964 --> 44:35.259
You could get new clothes,
clean yourself up,

44:35.300 --> 44:38.804
look men in the eyes when
you pass them on the street.

44:38.846 --> 44:41.890
This money could
make you a man again,

44:41.974 --> 44:45.102
instead of the shadow
of your former self.

44:50.816 --> 44:54.319
- l get to the river, l get the cash.
- Every nickel.

44:56.822 --> 45:01.493
- lf l don't make it ?
- Oh, you're a sports fan, Roper.

45:01.577 --> 45:04.079
Figure it out.

45:13.922 --> 45:17.342
You've got a five minute head start.
Don't waste it.

45:41.533 --> 45:44.536
This is New Orleans,
Mr. Zenan,

45:44.620 --> 45:46.538
not Beirut.

46:25.244 --> 46:27.204
After you, sir.

46:29.998 --> 46:32.668
- Mr. Zenan, take it off ''safe.''
- Oh.

47:33.979 --> 47:36.440
Finish him.

47:36.482 --> 47:40.402
l don't want him. H-He's wounded.

47:40.486 --> 47:42.946
- Finish him.
- l can't do that. l hit him.

47:42.988 --> 47:47.409
- l shot him. Let's go, okay ?
- Listen, don't make me look bad
in front of my dogs.

47:47.493 --> 47:49.411
You know why you're here ?

47:49.495 --> 47:51.663
You paid us a
half a million dollars...

47:51.747 --> 47:54.374
to find out
if you're alive or dead.

47:54.458 --> 47:57.252
Now finish him.

47:57.336 --> 47:59.713
Finish him !

47:59.796 --> 48:02.257
God, why didn't he
go fishing ?

48:41.088 --> 48:43.882
Now you understand why we
insist on payment up front.

48:47.469 --> 48:49.388
Here.

48:50.806 --> 48:53.392
Set the dogs on him,
won't you, Pick ?

48:53.433 --> 48:55.227
l don't wanna be out here
all night.

49:01.275 --> 49:04.695
Help me !
Please ! Please !

49:11.910 --> 49:14.788
Help me !

49:14.872 --> 49:17.249
H-- Please !
Help me ! Help me !

49:17.291 --> 49:19.251
- Go on, get a job !
- Please !

49:19.293 --> 49:22.421
- Please !
- Watch it ! Damn ! Watch yourself !

49:22.462 --> 49:26.091
Help me. Help me !

49:26.133 --> 49:30.596
Help me ! Please !

49:36.476 --> 49:38.562
Hey, look !
Come on, man !

49:38.604 --> 49:41.607
- Walk on by, now, man.
- Call the police here or somethin' !

49:41.690 --> 49:43.567
Help me !

49:45.527 --> 49:47.946
- Hey ! Hey ! Let me in ! Come on, man !
- No, we're closed !

49:47.988 --> 49:50.032
Let me in !

49:50.115 --> 49:52.451
Hey, buddy !
Hey ! Hey ! Come on !

49:52.534 --> 49:55.329
- Brother, get out of here, man.
Come on, get out of here.
- Hey, come on, man !

49:55.412 --> 49:58.624
- Help me !
- Hey ! l ain't got no change, man !

51:40.392 --> 51:43.228
He was passin' out flyers
for Randal Poe.

51:43.312 --> 51:45.981
Let's pay him a visit.

52:46.875 --> 52:49.795
Randal, Randal, Randal.

52:51.171 --> 52:54.633
You were gonna leave
without saying good-bye ?

52:56.802 --> 52:59.429
My mama got sick in Biloxi.
l--

53:01.640 --> 53:03.851
l was gonna call you,
Mr. Van Cleaf.

53:03.934 --> 53:06.395
Of course you were,
Randal.

53:06.478 --> 53:08.897
Of course you were.

53:08.981 --> 53:13.402
l know you didn't mean to
hurt my feelings.

53:13.485 --> 53:16.071
Hmm ?

54:01.992 --> 54:05.120
Looks like we missed
the party.

54:12.794 --> 54:15.005
- Get down !
- Ooh !

54:40.948 --> 54:42.533
Stay down !

55:04.096 --> 55:07.140
Go ! Go ! Go !

56:20.797 --> 56:23.842
- Let's go.
- We can't just leave her here !

56:25.511 --> 56:27.971
Keep him in the Quarter.
Stay on his ass.

56:28.013 --> 56:31.391
She's dead. Come on.

57:07.386 --> 57:08.804
Grab the bar !

59:14.513 --> 59:16.139
Yeah !

59:59.224 --> 01:00:01.768
Ladies first.

01:00:01.852 --> 01:00:03.770
What ?

01:00:32.299 --> 01:00:35.177
lt appears we'll have
one last hunt after all, Pick.

01:01:08.252 --> 01:01:10.921
The train went by
maybe two,

01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:13.632
two and a half hours ago.

01:01:13.674 --> 01:01:16.885
This could be dangerous.
We're on his turf now.

01:01:16.969 --> 01:01:20.597
Thank you, gentlemen, for making
yourselves available on short notice.

01:01:20.639 --> 01:01:23.600
We are stalking
an exceptional opponent.

01:01:25.144 --> 01:01:27.938
Truly a world-class trophy.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.024
The price for participating
in this little excursion...

01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:33.402
is $750,000 each.

01:01:33.485 --> 01:01:35.988
Should one of you be lucky
enough to bring him down,

01:01:36.071 --> 01:01:38.073
l'll consider that hunter's
account paid in full.

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:46.373
Shouldn't we be worried
about alligators or something ?

01:01:46.456 --> 01:01:48.500
lf it make you
feel better,

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:50.502
yeah.

01:01:56.508 --> 01:02:00.053
Come on, keep going.
lt's still a long way...

01:02:00.137 --> 01:02:04.183
- to Uncle Douvee's place.
- At least they won't
be able to find us out here.

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:08.437
Yes, they will, if they have
a tracker as good as Uncle Douvee.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.773
All they have to do
is to check along the railroad.

01:02:11.857 --> 01:02:15.068
l'm just guessing
we have a couple of hours.

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:18.989
- Okay.
- Maybe less. Come on. Let's go.

01:02:28.373 --> 01:02:31.210
lsn't there
a trail or something ?

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:34.338
This is the trail.

01:02:35.422 --> 01:02:38.050
You're really enjoying yourself,
aren't you, Chance ?

01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:42.513
lf it's tough for us,
it's tough for them.

01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:49.394
You trust me ?

01:02:50.979 --> 01:02:53.398
Of course l trust you.

01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:57.027
Close your eyes.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:03:01.073
Why do you want me to trust you
with my eyes closed ?

01:03:02.491 --> 01:03:05.035
Close your eyes.

01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:41.071
- ls it dead ?
- Not hardly.

01:03:45.284 --> 01:03:48.036
What are you doing ?

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.581
l'm leaving a surprise
for my friends.

01:04:11.101 --> 01:04:13.729
Son of a bitch !

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.055
lf you would die quieter
and pick up the pace,

01:04:48.138 --> 01:04:51.099
Boudreaux would have less time
for these little surprises.

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:53.393
Jerome !

01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:56.063
Would you be so kind ?

01:04:56.146 --> 01:04:59.900
And do watch your step,
won't you ? Let's go.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:34.393
Sometime l amaze myself, me !

01:05:34.476 --> 01:05:38.856
ls good whiskey !
Make jack rabbit slap the bear !

01:05:57.624 --> 01:06:00.627
- Chance ? Chance.
- Yeah !

01:06:08.594 --> 01:06:12.097
You come to see your Uncle Douvee.

01:06:14.975 --> 01:06:18.479
Natasha,
my Uncle Douvee.

01:06:18.562 --> 01:06:21.064
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:27.779
We'll fix him up good.
Put bandage on, it no hurt.

01:06:27.863 --> 01:06:32.493
- Be strong, my boy.
- Douvee, l've got some people after me.

01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:36.705
l know.
l can smell them.

01:06:36.788 --> 01:06:40.042
You've still got a .30-06,
the one l gave you for your birthday ?

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.878
No. A gator ate it.

01:06:44.338 --> 01:06:47.591
But, uh,

01:06:47.633 --> 01:06:49.593
l've still got
your shotgun.

01:07:39.017 --> 01:07:42.396
So tell me, this mans
what chase after you,

01:07:42.479 --> 01:07:45.023
he mad at you
for business or pleasure ?

01:07:45.065 --> 01:07:48.819
- Both.
- Uh-huh.

01:07:48.861 --> 01:07:52.406
l'm going to take Elvira south,
then to Bayou La Fouche,

01:07:52.489 --> 01:07:54.408
Mardi Gras graveyard.

01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:59.079
lf you can talk her
into it, go ahead.

01:07:59.163 --> 01:08:01.290
You be careful.

01:08:07.629 --> 01:08:10.132
Don't worry about me.

01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:12.134
l love the company.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:21.560
Be careful.
Without you, l'm hunting them.

01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:52.381
He's gonna be all right.

01:08:52.424 --> 01:08:54.718
Oui. Come.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.720
We go.

01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:43.517
Here, drink. But do not spill.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.519
lt kill the grass.

01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:50.274
The place is clean.
He just left.

01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:37.404
Get the fuck down !

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.690
Hey !

01:11:13.732 --> 01:11:15.526
Hold it !

01:11:17.569 --> 01:11:20.823
Boudreaux is the target
we're after.

01:11:22.449 --> 01:11:25.744
You are a fucking buffalo !

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:26.912
Move !

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:45.222
Boudreaux went this way, maybe ten,
15 minutes ago. He's on a horse.

01:11:46.723 --> 01:11:49.643
He's trying to lead us
away from his friends.

01:11:51.687 --> 01:11:54.398
Get in
the fucking trucks.

01:11:54.439 --> 01:11:58.360
Move ! Fucking move !
Will you move ? Move !

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:01.989
They're fucking brain-dead.

01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:07.035
Get the helicopter.
Find Boudreaux.

01:12:07.119 --> 01:12:11.540
- We'll set up an ambush
this side of Bayou La Fouche.
- l can take him from the air.

01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:14.751
Any pinhead can take him from the air.
l want to take him from the ground !

01:12:14.793 --> 01:12:16.962
l can take him
from the air.

01:12:17.004 --> 01:12:20.632
- Be a professional, Pick.
- Hey, you're making a mistake here.

01:12:21.884 --> 01:12:24.720
Make sure
he gets there, Pick.

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:57.669
That's him.

01:16:17.035 --> 01:16:19.413
Hey, pigeon.

01:16:44.855 --> 01:16:48.066
Avril Pybus has a store
two miles this way.

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:51.278
You go to a telephone,
call the sheriff.

01:16:51.361 --> 01:16:53.906
You know,

01:16:53.989 --> 01:16:57.242
chére, l think you should
call the sheriff.

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:04.917
lt appears your trophy's
ripping us a new orifice.

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:08.420
Let me review the tactical situation
for you, gentlemen.

01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:11.089
Boudreaux is wounded.
He's been pursued and harried...

01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:13.509
across miles of open country.

01:17:13.592 --> 01:17:17.179
Now he's cornered
and outnumbered 20 to 1.

01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:19.807
He's an annoying little
fucking insect...

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:22.434
and l want him
stepped on, hard.

01:17:23.852 --> 01:17:27.439
You're not angry with me,
are you, Pick ?

01:17:27.481 --> 01:17:30.609
l don't get angry.

01:17:30.692 --> 01:17:32.611
l'm a professional.

01:18:01.306 --> 01:18:03.100
Let's move !

01:19:03.785 --> 01:19:05.704
This is not good.

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:11.126
lf we walk away now,
we can be in Mexico in five hours.

01:19:11.210 --> 01:19:13.670
What the fuck is the matter
with you, Pick ?

01:19:13.712 --> 01:19:15.714
Hunting drunks in alleys
made you soft ?

01:20:01.426 --> 01:20:05.889
God, that son-of-a-bitch
is good !

01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:10.018
Goddamn it, l'm gonna blow
his goddamn head off !

01:20:10.102 --> 01:20:13.105
What are you lookin' at,
you sons-of-bitches ?

01:20:13.188 --> 01:20:16.150
This is what you paid for !
Get him !

01:20:30.956 --> 01:20:33.041
Seal off this place.

01:20:35.210 --> 01:20:37.129
The son-of-a-bitch
is mine.

01:21:30.349 --> 01:21:33.852
Sorry about the shirt.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.981
Give it a rest, pal.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:49.993
- Now what do you want to do ?
- Now--

01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:53.455
Now we put arrow into everyone
what's not Chance, huh ?

01:21:53.539 --> 01:21:55.582
Come.

01:22:38.876 --> 01:22:41.378
You fuckin' bitch !

01:22:47.759 --> 01:22:49.928
Now--
Now look what you do.

01:22:49.970 --> 01:22:53.182
Give me this gun.
l take care all this bad guy.

01:22:53.265 --> 01:22:55.184
Give me this gun !

01:23:29.218 --> 01:23:31.929
Chance !

01:23:59.706 --> 01:24:02.668
- l told you to go for help.
- But we help.

01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:05.838
All these men try to kill you.
We're here to help.

01:25:05.439 --> 01:25:08.609
Boudreaux,
Boudreaux, Boudreaux.

01:25:11.987 --> 01:25:15.115
l've been looking
all over for you.

01:25:15.199 --> 01:25:19.995
- You've been looking
in the wrong places.
- That's good,

01:25:20.078 --> 01:25:23.332
'cause l know you wouldn't
want to... hurt my feelings.

01:27:18.405 --> 01:27:20.699
Can you get up ?

01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:23.410
l cannot dance,
but l can get up.

01:28:05.494 --> 01:28:07.788
Hey !

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:55.169
Hey !

01:28:58.297 --> 01:29:01.467
You lucky son-of-a-bitch !

01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:05.220
- You want some more of that ?
- Yeah !

01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:11.018
How does it feel
to be hunted ?

01:29:11.768 --> 01:29:14.021
You tell me !

01:29:14.104 --> 01:29:16.648
You should know better.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:21.153
There isn't a country in the world
l haven't fired a bullet in!

01:29:23.655 --> 01:29:25.991
You can't kill me!

01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:28.285
You can't kill me!

01:29:33.290 --> 01:29:34.666
l'm on every battlefield!

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.839
There's no winner here!

01:29:40.881 --> 01:29:42.341
l don't see one.

01:29:42.382 --> 01:29:44.301
You're looking at him!

01:29:46.178 --> 01:29:49.014
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch !
Take your best shot !

01:30:05.697 --> 01:30:06.698
Chance !

01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.701
Chance !

01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:17.543
My boy !

01:30:31.306 --> 01:30:33.517
Just shoot him !

01:30:35.727 --> 01:30:38.272
You won't do that, will you,
Mr. Boudreaux?

01:30:38.355 --> 01:30:42.359
- Chance, please !
- lf he shoots me, he'll kill you.

01:30:42.401 --> 01:30:46.363
He's picked the wrong tool
for the job.

01:30:50.576 --> 01:30:53.453
Put the weapon down...

01:30:54.746 --> 01:30:56.665
or l'll run her through !

01:30:58.959 --> 01:31:00.627
No !

01:31:26.445 --> 01:31:29.740
You see, Miss Binder,

01:31:29.781 --> 01:31:33.285
you l can understand;
it was a matter of family.

01:31:33.368 --> 01:31:37.623
You had nothing in common
with those people.

01:31:37.706 --> 01:31:41.418
What made you want to
complicate my life like this ?

01:31:43.462 --> 01:31:45.422
Poor people get bored too.

01:31:47.841 --> 01:31:49.635
- Come here.
- Please.

01:31:56.183 --> 01:31:58.811
Load me.

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.011
Hunting season... is over.

01:34:28.085 --> 01:34:29.837
Douvee !

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.839
Douvee !

01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:35.843
What is this noise ?

01:34:35.926 --> 01:34:38.804
l was dreaming.
Chére, l think about you.

01:34:38.887 --> 01:34:43.183
l tell this turkey,
he no kill this eagle.

01:34:43.976 --> 01:34:46.436
Some headache l got here!

01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:53.694
Oh, my God.

01:34:55.821 --> 01:34:58.866
- What ?
- l think l hurt pretty bad.

01:35:03.662 --> 01:35:06.915
Now this,
this real catastrophe !

01:35:06.999 --> 01:35:09.543
- This real bad.
- Yeah, real bad.

01:35:12.045 --> 01:35:16.341
Ah, when l was just
a little boy

01:35:16.383 --> 01:35:20.471
A-standin'
to my daddy's knee

01:35:20.512 --> 01:35:24.516
My papa said, Son
don't let the man get ya

01:35:24.558 --> 01:35:27.144
And do
what he done to me

01:35:29.771 --> 01:35:32.024
Born on the bayou

01:35:33.901 --> 01:35:36.987
Born on the bayou

01:35:38.155 --> 01:35:41.533
Born on the bayou
Lord, lord

01:36:54.565 --> 01:36:58.527
Wish l was back
on the bayou

01:36:58.610 --> 01:37:02.781
Rollin'
with some cajun queen

01:37:02.865 --> 01:37:06.326
A-wishin' l were
a fast freight train

01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:10.497
A-just a-chooglin'
on down to New Orleans

01:37:11.999 --> 01:37:14.585
Born on the bayou

01:37:16.128 --> 01:37:20.132
Born on the bayou
Mmm, mmm, mmm

01:37:20.174 --> 01:37:22.301
Born on the bayou

01:37:22.342 --> 01:37:24.970
Doin' it, doin' it
doin' it, doin' it

01:37:26.305 --> 01:37:28.140
Lord

01:37:45.115 --> 01:37:47.034
Oh, get back now

01:38:25.989 --> 01:38:30.160
Well, l can remember
the fourth of July

01:38:30.202 --> 01:38:34.248
A-runnin' through
the backwood bare

01:38:34.331 --> 01:38:38.293
And l can still hear
my ol' hound dog barkin'

01:38:38.377 --> 01:38:41.296
Chasin' down
a hoodoo there

01:38:42.506 --> 01:38:45.467
Chasin' down
a hoodoo there

01:38:47.553 --> 01:38:49.555
Born on the bayou

01:38:51.682 --> 01:38:55.644
Born on the bayou
Ohh, ohh

01:38:55.727 --> 01:38:58.188
Born on the bayou

01:38:58.230 --> 01:39:00.649
All right

01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:03.443
Do it, do it, do it

01:39:16.039 --> 01:39:18.083
Mmm, ohh
