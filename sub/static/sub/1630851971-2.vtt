00:10.051 --> 00:11.886
<i>My fianc√©'s name</i>
<i>is Carter Reum.</i>

00:11.928 --> 00:13.555
Hi, handsome.

00:13.596 --> 00:16.057
<i>It was just so unexpected</i>
<i>to be so happy,</i>

00:16.099 --> 00:18.476
in love, and be normal.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.730
I have never tried on
a wedding dress before, so--

00:21.771 --> 00:23.857
- When is the wedding?
- I don't know yet.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.859
Definitely before Christmas
and the holidays.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.569
- So this year?
- Yes.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.070
[laughter]

00:29.112 --> 00:31.072
- Paris is dragging her heels.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.824
This is your wedding.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.618
You have to, like,
be an adult and deal.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.370
'Cause it seems like
you're stalling a little bit.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.705
- I just figured out
who the [bleep] I was,

00:38.747 --> 00:39.706
like, a year ago.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.082
<i>My documentary,</i>
<i>"This is Paris,"</i>

00:41.124 --> 00:42.625
<i>premiered last year.</i>

00:42.667 --> 00:44.294
<i>I talk about</i>
<i>when I was a teenager</i>

00:44.336 --> 00:46.171
<i>and at school, I was abused.</i>

00:46.212 --> 00:47.589
Mwah.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.758
After opening up
in so many ways,

00:49.799 --> 00:51.092
it was the first time
in my life

00:51.134 --> 00:52.761
that I was ready for true love.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.347
- If anyone deserves
their fairy tale, it's you.

00:55.388 --> 00:57.432

- We got to get you good
at tennis

01:31.883 --> 01:34.594
so you can play
with our future children.

01:34.636 --> 01:36.096
- I used to be really good.

01:36.137 --> 01:38.431
Last time I played
was in Traverse City with you.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.850
- All right, let's play.
Let's just start slow, okay?

01:42.352 --> 01:44.437
All right, there you go.
Okay. Ready?

01:44.479 --> 01:45.939
Just remember
to look at the ball.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.607
I remember last time, you
didn't really look at the ball.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.150
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.528
<i>[soft music]</i>

01:51.569 --> 01:54.447
Okay. Nice job.
Take your time.

01:56.324 --> 01:58.618
Nice.

01:58.660 --> 02:01.121
Okay, let's start
with some basics.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.664
Try to keep
your racket up here.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.291
Yeah. Okay.
There you go.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.337
Whoa--oh, that was good though.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.797
That was good. Just--yeah.
A little space.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.841
<i>I love playing tennis</i>
<i>with Paris.</i>

02:12.882 --> 02:15.385
Half of it is that
she's quite a tennis player

02:15.427 --> 02:18.263
when she wants to focus on it,
and quite honestly,

02:18.304 --> 02:21.558
half of it is, she just looks
great in her tennis outfits.

02:21.599 --> 02:24.978
Good job. Good job.
Oh, nice job.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.689
When I took her to Michigan,
say we're playing tennis

02:27.731 --> 02:30.066
and she kind of lobbed
the ball high,

02:30.108 --> 02:31.359
and I didn't mean to,

02:31.401 --> 02:33.028
and I just kind of went
to hit it back,

02:33.069 --> 02:35.030
<i>and it definitely came off</i>
<i>the strings</i>

02:35.071 --> 02:37.323
a lot faster than I thought.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.492
And I just saw it
going towards Paris

02:39.534 --> 02:42.328
and I just kept thinking,
"Holy cow,

02:42.370 --> 02:44.414
"if that ball hits her
in her face,

02:44.456 --> 02:46.583
this could be the end
before it even starts."

02:46.624 --> 02:49.711
And thank goodness
it just bounced off her chest.

02:49.753 --> 02:53.006
And all my cousins were like,
"Oh, my gosh.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.425
I think he might've
just killed Paris Hilton."

02:55.467 --> 02:58.636
Luckily, tough as nails,
she said,

02:58.678 --> 03:01.348
"That's all you got?"
[laughs]

03:01.389 --> 03:04.059
Good job. You're looking good.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.353
Whoa.

03:06.394 --> 03:08.897
Backhand. Oh, nice job!

03:08.938 --> 03:11.941
Good job. Oh, nice job.
But I'm not risking it, P.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.153
You're too valuable to me now.
Oh!

03:15.195 --> 03:18.323
Oh! The wall got in the way.

03:18.365 --> 03:21.618
By the way, before I forget,
this week you really, really,

03:21.659 --> 03:24.788
really, really need to meet
with the wedding planner.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.247
- We have a date.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.290
- We have a date.
- 11/11.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.958
- So we have a date.
- Yeah.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.920
- And a dress for you.

03:31.961 --> 03:34.089
We're knocking on the door
of the rest, right?

03:34.130 --> 03:35.715
- Yeah.
- Promise me?

03:35.757 --> 03:38.385
'Cause you don't realize,
like, every week that goes by,

03:38.426 --> 03:39.761
it's getting harder and harder

03:39.803 --> 03:41.846
to have the wedding
of your dreams, so--

03:41.888 --> 03:43.515
- I know.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.017
- I've always been obsessed
with 11/11.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.104
Like, every morning
and every night at 11:11,

03:49.145 --> 03:52.774
I always make a wish,
and they always come true.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.694
<i>The one wish that I always</i>
<i>wanted was to find true love,</i>

03:55.735 --> 03:57.987
<i>and that one finally</i>
<i>came true with Carter.</i>

03:59.531 --> 04:00.782
- I love you.
- I love you.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.534
Now that we've decided
on 11/11,

04:02.575 --> 04:05.078
that means that we have
four months to the wedding,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.413
which is making me freak out

04:06.454 --> 04:08.039
because all of my friends
say that you need

04:08.081 --> 04:09.624
at least one year.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.794
So yeah, we have a lot to do.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.629
- I'm just gonna plan
the wedding with my sister,

04:14.671 --> 04:17.173
and we all know
nobody wants that, okay?

04:17.215 --> 04:19.300
- [scoffs] Okay.
- Is that--

04:19.342 --> 04:20.635
- No, I'm definitely
planning it.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.220
It's just,
my schedule is insane.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.807
- But you get the ironic part
of that statement,

04:25.849 --> 04:28.101
which is, if your schedule
is so insane,

04:28.143 --> 04:31.312
you never have time
to plan the wedding,

04:31.354 --> 04:32.814
you're never gonna
have the wedding.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.191
- Even though I have
an insanely busy schedule

04:35.233 --> 04:38.153
and so much on my plate,
but this is my wedding.

04:38.194 --> 04:39.612
<i>So he's right.</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:41.489
<i>I need to find time</i>
<i>to plan this wedding,</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:42.991
<i>because it's gonna be a lot.</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:46.578
Do you know what your
sister's nickname is for you?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.997
- No. What'd does she call me?

04:49.039 --> 04:50.290
- Groomzilla.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.876
- Groomzilla?
I am not Groomzilla.

04:52.917 --> 04:53.918
- Yes, you are.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.087
- I'm sorry
that I'm the only one

04:56.129 --> 04:59.215
trying to drive
the planning ship forward.

04:59.257 --> 05:02.552
Early days of wedding planning,
I said, "You and your mom

05:02.594 --> 05:04.596
"and my sister,
you guys plan everything.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.931
"Tell me where to show up
and what to wear,

05:06.973 --> 05:08.850
and then I'll leave it all
to you guys."

05:08.892 --> 05:13.021
And then tick, tock,
tick, tock.

05:13.063 --> 05:18.026
The days, the weeks,
the months went by.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.196
And that's when Groomzilla
had to step up to the plate.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.530
[both laugh]

05:22.572 --> 05:24.657
I just want to plan
the most amazing wedding.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.326
It's less important to you,
but I want to figure out

05:26.368 --> 05:29.245
if we could do, like, a fun
tennis tournament and barbecue.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.580
But what do you think?

05:30.622 --> 05:31.873
- A tennis tournament?

05:31.915 --> 05:35.210
- Well, like,
we have to plan, like--

05:35.251 --> 05:36.753
- [scoffs]
- Oh, come on.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.171
- It sounds like
my biggest nightmare.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.839
- No, no, you are not gonna--
oh, sorry.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.341
You thought you were gonna be
in the tennis tournament.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.467
No, no, you're definitely
not gonna be

05:42.509 --> 05:43.760
in the tennis tournament,

05:43.802 --> 05:46.054
but just--I mean,
just more broadly, like,

05:46.096 --> 05:47.764
thinking about how do we,
like, have a pool--

05:47.806 --> 05:50.892
like, at my sister's wedding,
we had a pool party

05:50.934 --> 05:53.061
and cryo and doing fun stuff.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.729
You always give me
these blank stares.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.731
I forget
you've never been to weddings.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.733
- I told you I've been
to my sister's wedding

05:58.775 --> 06:00.735
and my brother's wedding

06:00.777 --> 06:03.863
'cause I had to go, obviously,
'cause it's my family.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.949
But no, I've never
really been to weddings.

06:05.990 --> 06:10.328
- When you go home today,
can you Google "wedding 101"?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.746
- Usually, I'm working.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.289
I'm traveling
to a different country,

06:13.331 --> 06:16.167
because I always have to do
a club appearance.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.503
<i>So I never had time</i>
<i>to go to weddings.</i>

06:18.545 --> 06:20.839
- You need to spend more time
with Nicky,

06:20.880 --> 06:24.092
my sister, your cousin Farrah,
people that go to weddings.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.553
They'll keep telling you
more about why people like it.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.681
- I'm gonna try to think of
an activity that I can invent,

06:29.723 --> 06:32.934
because you are doing
the tennis part,

06:32.976 --> 06:34.352
so I have to think
of something fun

06:34.394 --> 06:36.479
so I have an activity.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.773
<i>Our wedding is supposed to be</i>
<i>a three-day event.</i>

06:38.815 --> 06:41.026
So far, we don't even have
the first venue.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.528
So Carter is getting
really nervous

06:43.570 --> 06:45.113
<i>and starting to freak out.</i>

06:45.155 --> 06:48.241
- I think we could do--we could
set up, like, a really cool,

06:48.283 --> 06:49.701
like, wellness experience,

06:49.743 --> 06:52.120
but we have to try--
that's the problem a little bit

06:52.162 --> 06:54.706
since we so far haven't found
a hotel to buy out.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.957
Normally if you buy out
the hotel,

06:55.999 --> 06:58.126
you just kind of can
change everything.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.502
When I think about
the best weekends

06:59.544 --> 07:00.962
I've ever had for weddings,

07:01.004 --> 07:03.131
it's always that you bring
everyone together

07:03.173 --> 07:06.009
or you bump into people
in the morning at the gym.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.470
People do, you know--
- The gym?

07:08.511 --> 07:09.929
- Well, maybe
we can compromise.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
You don't have to come
to the things like the barbecue

07:12.349 --> 07:13.600
for the wedding

07:13.641 --> 07:15.310
or my tennis tournament
for the wedding.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.770
- But that's gonna look weird.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.146
'Cause I feel like
as the bride,

07:18.188 --> 07:21.024
you're, like, supposed to be
at everything, probably.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.901
I'm gonna get, like,
a custom sick,

07:22.942 --> 07:24.819
like, white tennis outfit made

07:24.861 --> 07:26.237
that has, like, a little tiny--

07:26.279 --> 07:29.157
like, a little small--
what are they called?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.575
- A veil?
- Veil.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.495
And then, like,
cute high heel white boots

07:33.536 --> 07:36.498
and then come down and wave
and be like, "I love you guys."

07:36.539 --> 07:37.665
- I love you.
[laughs]

07:37.707 --> 07:39.084
- And the go to the spa.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.752
- Done. I love it.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.713
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

<i>* *</i>

07:53.223 --> 07:54.641
- Hi.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.352
- Here they are. Hey, guys.
- Hi.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.770
both: Hi.
- This is amazing.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.563
- Welcome to St. Cloud.
- Hi, beautiful.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.856
- Four and half years
in the making.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.149
How have you been?
- Four and a half years?

08:03.191 --> 08:06.027
- Yeah.
Who's this little guy?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.821
- Oh, my goodness!
- This is Ether Reum.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.155
- The craziest thing
you've ever seen in your life.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.533
- He's so cute.
- Only in LA.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.368
- Only in LA.
- Matching shades.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.413
- And those little glasses.
I'm surprised he lets them on.

08:16.454 --> 08:19.916
- The last time I was here,
this was a pile of dirt.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.543
- Mom and Dad have been
working on this

08:21.584 --> 08:23.336
for, like,
four and a half years.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.423
- Now you're selling the place.
- I know. It's crazy.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.968
- My parents bought St. Cloud
five years ago,

08:30.010 --> 08:33.555
<i>and they built it from</i>
<i>the ground up to move into.</i>

08:33.596 --> 08:38.184
And in true Kathy Hilton style,
she changed her mind.

08:38.226 --> 08:42.022
She said, "You know what?
I actually love my house.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.565
And there's nothing better."

08:43.606 --> 08:47.652
So Barron and Tessa,
they will be selling the house.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.612
- Hottest new real estate
couple in town.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.031
[laughter]

08:51.072 --> 08:52.657
- I wanted to just ask
you guys.

08:52.699 --> 08:56.411
What does this window
remind you of?

08:56.453 --> 08:57.746
- Papa's house.
- Yes.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.997
- Exactly.
- Brooklawn, right?

08:59.039 --> 09:01.041
- Yup.
- Brooklawn.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.251
- Brooklawn was
my grandfather's estate.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.961
When he passed away,
they sold it.

09:05.003 --> 09:06.629
<i>And it was hard</i>
<i>for our family,</i>

09:06.671 --> 09:09.841
<i>because it's been</i>
<i>such a huge part of our lives.</i>

09:09.883 --> 09:12.969
- Do you know
this ribbed gem over here?

09:14.637 --> 09:16.556
Which is, like,
in Papa's cigar room

09:16.598 --> 09:18.350
where he'd always
have his cigar.

09:18.391 --> 09:24.064
- We spent every Thanksgiving,
every Easter, Christmas,

09:24.105 --> 09:26.941
<i>the whole family</i>
<i>would come together.</i>

09:26.983 --> 09:30.111
It's so weird
to have that chapter

09:30.153 --> 09:33.490
and not have it be
in our family's hands anymore.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.783
- Just so you guys know,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.993
it's eight bedrooms,
16 bathrooms.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.746
- It's, like,
the perfect family house.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.247
- Right.
- The dream house.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.499
- Dad is so funny.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.459
When he knew we were
coming here, he's like,

09:44.501 --> 09:48.129
"Don't let Paris spill anything
and ruin the house."

09:48.171 --> 09:51.174
I'm like, "What do you think
she could possibly do?"

09:51.216 --> 09:53.301
- You never know with me.
- A lot.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.011
- A lot of damage.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.055
- I've always been super close
with my sister Nicky

09:57.097 --> 09:59.432
and my brother Barron,
but now that they're parents,

09:59.474 --> 10:01.893
<i>I don't get to see them</i>
<i>as much as I used to.</i>

10:01.935 --> 10:04.104
And it's just amazing
to get together

10:04.145 --> 10:06.773
because it's just
like old times.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.149
- And this one's cute.
It could work

10:08.191 --> 10:10.235
for, like, a teenager
'cause you can close it off.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.903
- Perfect window
to sneak out off.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.196
- I know. That's what I said.

10:13.238 --> 10:16.324
- Paris would definitely
jump out this window.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.203
- When I was, like, 12 I would
climb from--remember I had,

10:20.245 --> 10:21.746
like, my balcony
at Stradella in Bel Air.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.164
- Oh, I knew that, yeah.

10:23.206 --> 10:24.708
- And I would--I don't know
what I climbed down.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.626
The ivy or something,
like, was broke.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.919
- The water pipe.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.337
- Oh, the side--
yeah, the water pipe,

10:29.379 --> 10:30.463
and I would sneak out.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.882
- Wait, where were you
sneaking out...

10:32.924 --> 10:34.509
- To, like,
Nicole Richie's house.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.386
- And Century City Mall.

10:36.428 --> 10:39.014
- Growing up,
my parents were so strict.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.765
<i>I wasn't allowed</i>
<i>to go on a date.</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.976
<i>I couldn't go</i>
<i>to the school dance.</i>

10:43.018 --> 10:44.185
<i>I couldn't wear makeup.</i>

10:44.227 --> 10:46.938
<i>I literally couldn't</i>
<i>do anything.</i>

10:46.980 --> 10:49.190
I don't know, I think
from them being so strict,

10:49.232 --> 10:51.151
it just made me want to rebel.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.485
- Do you know that I used to,

10:52.527 --> 10:54.946
through my bathroom,
break into your room?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.114
- You did?
- Yeah.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.699
- Why?
- To tell on me?

10:57.741 --> 10:59.367
- To tell on her
and go through her stuff.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.827
- Thanks.
- Classy.

11:00.869 --> 11:03.496
- Didn't you come with me?
I thought we used to go out.

11:03.538 --> 11:08.752
- I snuck out once
for, like, 30 minutes.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.797
I got so scared that
I ran back home and got in bed.

11:12.839 --> 11:16.259
I was just--
I'm a rule follower.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.261
You didn't know about
the sneaking out, did you?

11:18.303 --> 11:19.554
- No.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.348
- What about when I snuck out
at the Waldorf?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.640
Do you remember that?

11:22.682 --> 11:25.727
- You would tell me,
"You can come out with me.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.063
You just have to give me
the key," so--

11:28.104 --> 11:29.898
- He was, like, eight.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.108
- I was so jacked up to go out.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.027
Then you would leave, and I'd
be like, "Where is she?"

11:34.069 --> 11:35.737
- To go out at night?
- Yeah.

11:35.779 --> 11:36.988
[laughter]

11:37.030 --> 11:38.782
- You're really demented,

11:38.823 --> 11:41.951
swindling an eight-year-old
for a key.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.578
- Oh, my God.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.082
- My parents would scare us
'cause we lived in a hotel

11:47.123 --> 11:50.168
<i>as teenagers in New York.</i>

11:50.210 --> 11:52.712
And I don't even know
to this day if it was true,

11:52.754 --> 11:55.340
if you were actually looking
at security cameras.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.927
But they said, "We see you."

11:58.968 --> 12:00.679
- I would run down,
like, flights of stairs

12:00.720 --> 12:01.805
to get to another level.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.973
- In wigs.
- Yeah.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.894
- I always say either your kids

12:07.936 --> 12:09.437
are gonna follow
in your footsteps

12:09.479 --> 12:13.066
and be super naughty,
or you get the opposite,

12:13.108 --> 12:15.610
and you get the cookie cutter,
best of the best.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.070
- I hope I get that one.

12:17.112 --> 12:18.863
- I know. Me too.
[laughter]

12:18.905 --> 12:21.449
- Please.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.742
This house is insane.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.077
It reminds me
so much of Papa's.

12:24.119 --> 12:25.203
- Mm-hmm.
- Right?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.205
- Mm-hmm.
- What's over there?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.542
- I love how it just,
like, leads out here.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.960
- This is gonna sell fast.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.795
- Ether, what do you think?

12:33.837 --> 12:36.631
- He wants to move in, ASAP.

12:36.673 --> 12:37.882
- Is he potty-trained?

12:37.924 --> 12:39.092
- Yeah.
- He's pissing.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.468
- Oh, now he's pissing.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.137
- Oh, no!
- Sorry.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.848
Ether.
- Go clean it up, Paris.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.850
- Okay.
- Don't stain the new house.

12:46.891 --> 12:49.477
- Go get a tissue.
- Ugh, Ether.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.604
- Where's the bathroom?
- I don't know.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.273
- There's 16 of them. Find one.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.233
- Okay.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.281
- What's that?

13:01.322 --> 13:02.532
- Unicorn Mist.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.161
It's, like, rose water
for your face.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.495
- Oh, that's pretty. Yeah.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.999
You don't do it like that.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.250
- That's enough.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.502
I don't want
to ruin the chairs.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.046
- They're rentals.
- Rolling!

13:16.087 --> 13:17.547
- Oh, my God. That scared me.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.799
<i>- * Everything is</i>
<i>so much better *</i>

13:19.841 --> 13:21.134
<i>* Everything is</i>
<i>so much better *</i>

13:21.176 --> 13:22.552
<i>* Since I met you *</i>

13:22.594 --> 13:25.096

13:30.435 --> 13:34.230

13:34.272 --> 13:35.857
- Mom?
- Yeah.

13:35.899 --> 13:38.193
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.527
- What's up?

13:39.569 --> 13:42.322
I just got these sent
from Valentino.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.907
Can I show you?
- Be careful. Look.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.825
- Diamond.
- That makes me so nervous.

13:45.867 --> 13:47.327
- Look at this bag.

13:47.369 --> 13:50.789
- Oh, wow. That is adorable.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.665
- Diamond, are you
on a Valentino bag?

13:52.707 --> 13:55.210
[dog barks]
Look at you.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.336
- It's so cute.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.630
- Mm-hmm. Wait.

13:58.672 --> 14:02.842
- So...what's going on?

14:03.677 --> 14:06.680
- We are just getting
everything ready, so--

14:06.721 --> 14:10.350
- You know, you and I kind of
live sometimes in La La Land.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.143
Like, everything's
just gonna happen.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.520
- I know.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.981
- I have a hard time,
and I find you do too.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.818
Like, okay, we're having
a Halloween party.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.361
Do you want an orange
or a black

14:21.403 --> 14:22.821
or a purple tablecloth?

14:22.862 --> 14:26.449
I will ponder and go on and on
before we call it

14:26.491 --> 14:29.619
and finally make that order
until the last minute.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.705
And I feel like
you're that way too.

14:31.746 --> 14:33.373
- Yeah.

14:33.415 --> 14:35.542
<i>- I am a bit</i>
<i>of a procrastinator.</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:36.918
I will get it done.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.546
I just need to get her--

14:39.587 --> 14:44.009
she's, like, trying to catch
a rabbit in Central Park.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.385
Seriously.

14:45.427 --> 14:48.888
What you need to work on
is your guest list.

14:48.930 --> 14:52.267
And I think you can say
it's been strict,

14:52.308 --> 14:53.810
because it's in a church,

14:53.852 --> 14:56.980
and we could not
have everybody.

14:57.022 --> 14:59.357
- I just don't want to decide
on it until we see it,

14:59.399 --> 15:00.775
'cause I just need to see--
- See what?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.277
- 'Cause I don't wanna
show up the day of my wedding

15:02.318 --> 15:04.237
and be like, "I hate it here."

15:04.279 --> 15:06.948
Not hate it, but I just want it
to be a magical day.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.576
Like, this is, like,
you only get married once.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.995
- Well, I mean, Dad and I
were married there.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.290
Papa's brother Uncle Nick

15:15.331 --> 15:17.959
and Elizabeth were
married there.

15:18.001 --> 15:22.380
Grandma's funeral was there.
Papa's funeral. Nana's funeral.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.882
- That's the only things
I've been to there

15:23.923 --> 15:25.717
are all three
of their funerals.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.136
So that's why in my mind, like,
all I can think of

15:28.178 --> 15:29.387
is, like, my grandfather

15:29.429 --> 15:30.972
and both my grandmothers'
funerals at that--

15:31.014 --> 15:32.390
that's the only memories
I have of it.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.683
Obviously, I wasn't
at your wedding.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.477
- Well, the church
does mean a lot to us.

15:35.518 --> 15:36.686
- Well, can we
go there together

15:36.728 --> 15:38.563
just so we can, like, see--
- Sure.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.857
I want it to be something
that you want and, you know--

15:40.899 --> 15:42.108
- Have you talked to Father Ed?

15:42.150 --> 15:43.526
- No, I have not talked
to Father Ed.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.153
I'll have Dad do that.

15:45.195 --> 15:47.697
I think he wants to know that
you definitely want your day.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.657
- 11/11,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.576
which is a Thursday,
so I'm assuming nobody

15:51.618 --> 15:54.412
gets married
on a Thursday, so--right?

15:54.454 --> 15:55.663
- I don't think so.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.999
So you're getting married
on a Thursday.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.918
- Usually for weddings,
I heard that they do, like,

15:59.959 --> 16:01.461
Thursday is, like,
the welcome dinner

16:01.503 --> 16:02.837
for the out-of-towners to come.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.674
Then Friday, the whatever--
rehearsal dinner.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.676
- Okay.
- Then Saturday the wedding

16:07.717 --> 16:09.636
and then Sunday the brunch,
but for me,

16:09.678 --> 16:11.846
I don't want to have to, like,

16:11.888 --> 16:14.557
be so stressed out
before I wear my wedding gown.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.476
So I just want to do Thursday
at the church,

16:16.518 --> 16:17.852
get it over with--

16:17.894 --> 16:19.270
not get it over with,
but you know what I mean.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.481
Like, do the stressful part.

16:21.523 --> 16:22.607
Then Friday--
- But that's when--

16:22.649 --> 16:25.151
- You always interrupt me.
- I'm sorry.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.653
- So Thursday the wedding,

16:26.695 --> 16:29.447
and then after,
have, like, a wedding dinner.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.157
- Uh-huh.
- Like, I don't know.

16:31.199 --> 16:32.409
Maybe at
the Beverly Hills Hotel.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.119
- Mm-hmm.
- And Carter's been speaking

16:34.160 --> 16:36.246
to, like,
the head of Dorchester Group.

16:36.287 --> 16:39.457
- Paris, Ed is my friend.
We lived at that hotel.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.042
Why is he doing that?

16:41.084 --> 16:42.544
- He was on the phone for three
and a half hours yesterday.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.045
- What is he worried
about that for?

16:44.087 --> 16:46.506
- Well he's like, "Paris,
you don't plan anything.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.883
So I have to plan things."
I don't know.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.928
- So he's gone ahead and called
the Beverly Hills Hotel?

16:51.970 --> 16:53.513
<i>[tense music]</i>

16:53.555 --> 16:56.558
- [laughs]
- I'm the mother.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.768
- I know.
- Of the bride.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.771
- He booked a photographer
who is amazing.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.398
And he...
- Wait a second.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.317
- Booking the band,
the music person.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.652
Yeah.
- Have you ever heard--

17:07.694 --> 17:09.279
I mean, I'm just being honest
with you.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.406
- Yeah.
- This man's an octopus.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.824
- What's an octopus?

17:12.866 --> 17:15.910
- He's got his mitts
in everything.

17:15.952 --> 17:19.039
I don't know
if Paris understands,

17:19.080 --> 17:22.667
it is traditionally
the mother of the bride

17:22.709 --> 17:26.046
that handles
her daughter's wedding.

17:26.087 --> 17:28.256
<i>So, like, we were at</i>
<i>Next Health Center.</i>

17:28.298 --> 17:31.134
We had a wonderful day,
and she proceeds to bring out

17:31.176 --> 17:34.220
this save-the-date card
that Carter made.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.934
What is this?

17:39.976 --> 17:43.104
- He had save-the-dates made.
- What?

17:43.146 --> 17:45.273
- It's diamond, baby.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.275
- "P and C"...
- Yeah.

17:47.317 --> 17:48.943
- "Getting hitched."

17:48.985 --> 17:51.488
This looks
like a dog's birthday party.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.698
- [laughs]
- There's no way.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.409
- Well, he has hundreds of them
at the house.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.203
- Well, he's wasted his time.

18:00.038 --> 18:05.251
You and I will be meeting
with the wedding planner alone.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.712
- Alone?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.255
- Don't start that, okay?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.841
- The groomzilla?
Of course he wants to come.

18:11.883 --> 18:14.511
- No. You're joking, right?

18:14.552 --> 18:16.304
<i>I'm the final call.</i>

18:16.346 --> 18:18.556
Whoever writes the check.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.808
I mean, do you know
what I'm saying?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.476
This is, like, my wedding too.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.186
- [scoffs]

18:23.228 --> 18:26.106
- How do you think it makes me
look and feel

18:26.147 --> 18:30.193
when the son-in-law-to-be
is already called over there

18:30.235 --> 18:34.823
and--what is--how long ago
did he move here?

18:34.864 --> 18:37.033
- Who? Carter?
- Yes.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.035
- He moved here 15 years ago
when I met him first.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.538
- But do you understand
that I go back to that hotel

18:41.579 --> 18:43.039
since I'm five years old?

18:43.081 --> 18:44.457
- No.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.626
- If you walk down the street
on Wilshire Boulevard

18:46.668 --> 18:48.003
or Fifth Avenue...

18:48.044 --> 18:49.879
[dog barking]
And you said to people,

18:49.921 --> 18:54.884
"Have you ever heard
of a groom"--quiet--

18:54.926 --> 18:59.014
"going ahead
and contacting the hotel,

18:59.055 --> 19:01.391
talking
to the general manager"...

19:01.433 --> 19:02.684
- Do you realize
how many weddings

19:02.726 --> 19:04.436
have been moved to November
because of--

19:04.477 --> 19:05.937
- And there is nothing going on

19:05.979 --> 19:08.815
on a Thursday night
for a wedding anywhere.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.569
- He wrote me yesterday.
He's like, "I've been planning

19:12.610 --> 19:14.029
"for the past
three and a half hours,

19:14.070 --> 19:15.947
'cause I don't want to risk
not marrying you."

19:15.989 --> 19:19.284
He also is nervous that
I'm gonna get, like, how I am.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.911
- Right.
- Like, a runaway bride.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.872
Like, I feel like
he is maybe scared of that.

19:23.913 --> 19:26.291
- He very well could be.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.126
I think he just needs to chill
a little bit

19:28.168 --> 19:30.712
and just explain for him
to stay in his lane.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.382
- I'm not gonna say
"Stay in your own lane" to him.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.009
That's so mean.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.761
I love my mom, but I don't know
how she's gotten it

19:37.802 --> 19:40.805
into her mind
that my wedding is her wedding.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.559
- Um...maybe just a little bit.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.562
- Like I don't want to be mean
and hurt her feelings,

19:47.604 --> 19:49.147
<i>but, like, I'm the bride.</i>

19:49.189 --> 19:53.610
You're the mother of the bride.
You stay in your lane, miss.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.195
- Have him stop with the calls.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.323
- Well, then you make
some calls, dear.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.158
- Dear, I will.

20:06.581 --> 20:09.417
<i>- * You say</i>
<i>I'm your dream girl *</i>

20:09.459 --> 20:13.672
<i>* Pretty young thing, oh,</i>
<i>nothing you've ever seen *</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:16.341
<i>* Dream girl *</i>

20:16.383 --> 20:18.468
<i>* Dream girl *</i>

20:18.510 --> 20:19.886
<i>- It's happening, P.</i>

20:19.928 --> 20:21.888
- Okay, how are you, baby?
- What are you doing?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.348
You look gorgeous.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.475
You look like my bride-to-be
in that white dress.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.311
- Thank you, handsome.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.562
- Whoa. What's all this?

20:29.604 --> 20:31.856
- I am just prepping,

20:31.898 --> 20:34.484
being inspired,
coming up with ideas.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.361
Since you called me
the absentee bride,

20:36.403 --> 20:39.823
I decided to channel
some bridal vibes in the white.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.991
- [laughs]

20:42.033 --> 20:43.702
So what are the mood boards?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.620
- These are
the wedding dresses.

20:45.662 --> 20:48.039
- You do look great in white.
- Thank you, baby.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.624
What are you gonna do

20:49.666 --> 20:51.876
when you see me walking down
the aisle in one of these?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.546
- I am definitely gonna cry.
You know that.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.923
But you told me I can't cry,
'cause then you're gonna cry.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.134
- Yeah, don't cry.
- [laughs]

20:59.175 --> 21:02.053
- I don't want mascara running
down my face on my wedding day.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.432
- It's funny because while you
were out here doing this,

21:05.473 --> 21:07.517
I went on the internet

21:07.559 --> 21:09.561
and I pulled together
a small checklist.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.062
- Okay.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.983
- Our planning's
just not exactly on target.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.193
Can I run you through?
I just took a few notes.

21:17.235 --> 21:19.362
You'll see I just started
a few things.

21:19.404 --> 21:23.199
And this is things that
you need to do 12 months out.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.409
Now, let's count

21:24.451 --> 21:26.161
how many months out
we are from the wedding.

21:26.202 --> 21:29.414
- How many?
- Four months.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.498
Okay. Select a caterer.

21:30.540 --> 21:32.792
How are you and your mom
doing on that?

21:32.834 --> 21:34.210
- Didn't do that yet.

21:34.252 --> 21:35.503
- Start shopping
for your wedding dress.

21:35.545 --> 21:36.796
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:36.838 --> 21:39.257
Book a hotel room block
for guests.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.551
No? No.
Create your wedding website.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.928
- Wedding website?
- We're gonna say no to that.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.305
- We should come up
with a hashtag.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.599
- Do you have any ideas?
- No.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.975
- Hmm. Seems dubious at best.

21:49.017 --> 21:50.727
- I'm moving things along
as much as I can.

21:50.769 --> 21:52.270
- You're moving things along?

21:52.312 --> 21:54.647
- I've missed a couple things,
but I have a list now, so...

21:54.689 --> 21:55.774
- Yeah. Well, let's see--

21:55.815 --> 21:57.108
- Let's send this to my mom.

21:57.150 --> 21:58.234
- You and your mom do
any talking

21:58.276 --> 21:59.694
this week about the wedding?

21:59.736 --> 22:01.071
- Yes.
- You did?

22:01.112 --> 22:03.031
Just talking or any doing?

22:03.073 --> 22:05.241
<i>[tense music]</i>

22:05.283 --> 22:08.078
- I told her that you were
spending, like,

22:08.119 --> 22:10.622
three and a half hours
yesterday talking--

22:10.663 --> 22:11.831
- Somebody has to.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.793
- To the Beverly Hills hotel.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.127
She was like, "What?

22:16.169 --> 22:18.797
I've never heard
of a groom doing that."

22:18.838 --> 22:21.675
And she said--don't get mad,

22:21.716 --> 22:26.262
but she was just like,
"Tell him, stay in his lane."

22:26.304 --> 22:27.681
- [laughs]

22:27.722 --> 22:30.725
Well, the thing is,
I'm happy to stay in my lane.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.603
We just need you and your mom
to get into a vehicle

22:33.645 --> 22:37.107
and start moving in your lane,
since it's been eight weeks.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.984
And that lane seems like
there's a car accident

22:40.026 --> 22:42.112
and no cars are
getting through.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.657
- I'm not gonna say that her.
She could get so mad.

22:45.699 --> 22:46.866
- I'll tap her in.

22:46.908 --> 22:49.577
Tell her I--"Carter will
stay in his lane.

22:49.619 --> 22:50.912
"We just need someone else

22:50.954 --> 22:53.123
to go in the lane
to start doing stuff."

22:53.164 --> 22:54.332
- I'll tell her.
- Deal.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.875
I was hoping to be
in a parked car

22:55.917 --> 22:58.795
while they were just going down
the lanes themselves.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.464
<i>They will look back and go,</i>
<i>"Gosh, Carter,</i>

23:01.506 --> 23:04.426
"we're really lucky
we had Groomzilla

23:04.467 --> 23:06.219
<i>"keeping the ball</i>
<i>moving forward.</i>

23:06.261 --> 23:07.679
<i>"Otherwise, we would end up</i>

23:07.721 --> 23:10.974
at the Vegas Wedding Chapel
in Las Vegas."

23:11.766 --> 23:14.060
I know the wedding
is really important to you.

23:14.102 --> 23:17.480
And so in the absence of others
having the time

23:17.522 --> 23:19.315
or the attention
to move the ball forward,

23:19.357 --> 23:21.484
that's all I was trying to do.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.695
- Well, I like
you helping still.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.030
I think it's cute.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.157
- And I was hoping to be
the absentee groom.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.074
- Sure.
- That was my dream.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.492
- Yeah, right.

23:29.534 --> 23:32.328
- And instead,
you've put me in as Groomzilla.

23:32.370 --> 23:34.289
- We gonna plan a honeymoon?

23:34.330 --> 23:37.876
- I was thinking, like,
go see the northern lights,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.879
go, like, swim
with sperm whales...

23:40.920 --> 23:42.422
<i>[record scratch]</i>

23:42.464 --> 23:44.174
- Sperm whale? Ew!
- No, it's not what it sounds--

23:44.215 --> 23:46.718
whales, big whales.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.387
- I just feel like
if I, like, post about it,

23:49.429 --> 23:51.139
then people are gonna,
like, make weird memes,

23:51.181 --> 23:54.601
like Paris and the sperm,
like, swimming together.

23:54.642 --> 23:56.895
So, like, maybe, like,
I dunno what they're called--

23:56.936 --> 23:58.271
- Okay, we'll go
to the humpback whales.

23:58.313 --> 23:59.689
- Yeah.
- Okay.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.192
- That's actually weird too.
The name humpback.

24:03.234 --> 24:06.154
- So whales is--
- Just normal whales.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.865
Well, we could just find,
like, cute whales.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.450
- Gray whales.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.036
- Yeah.
- All right. Deal.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.454
All right, I'm gonna go work.

24:14.496 --> 24:15.705
- Okay. Bye, baby.

24:15.747 --> 24:19.084
- Make sure your mom gets
my 38-page printout.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.252
- I will.
- All right. Love you lots.

24:21.294 --> 24:25.006
- I love you, honey.
Oh, my goodness.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.013
<i>- * Hello, beautiful *</i>

24:32.055 --> 24:35.183
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

24:35.225 --> 24:39.020
<i>* *</i>

24:39.062 --> 24:41.314
- Hello?
- Hi.

24:41.356 --> 24:43.024
We're in here.
- Hi, guys.

24:43.066 --> 24:44.109
Sorry I'm late.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.819
- Already dressed
in white, I see.

24:45.860 --> 24:46.903
- Yep. Hi, sweetheart.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.363
- Cute outfit.
- Thank you.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.281
- This is Andrew.
- Hi, Andrew.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.867
- Nice to meet you.
- He's my lead designer.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.828
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.204
So this is exciting.

24:56.246 --> 24:58.415
- But we wanted
to meet just now

24:58.456 --> 25:02.752
to go over the look,
the flowers, the--

25:02.794 --> 25:04.254
- The table.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.756
<i>Mindy and I have done</i>
<i>several events</i>

25:06.798 --> 25:07.924
<i>over the years together.</i>

25:07.966 --> 25:10.719
If I need something
and I can't find it,

25:10.760 --> 25:13.054
I know I just call Mindy.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.098
<i>Together, we're a great team.</i>

25:15.140 --> 25:18.435
And I cannot imagine
using anyone else.

25:18.476 --> 25:21.021
- So we kind of wanted
to make it,

25:21.062 --> 25:23.440
you know,
a little more romantic.

25:23.481 --> 25:26.317
- I never like the same flower
arrangement on every table.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.069
It looks like a charity event.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.821
- 'Cause then
people walk around

25:29.863 --> 25:32.198
and then they look
at each table and go, "Oh."

25:32.240 --> 25:33.825
- And it's really interesting.
- Yeah.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.744
- But people won't
get insulted, like,

25:35.785 --> 25:37.579
"Oh, these are cuter flowers"?
Like--

25:37.620 --> 25:39.456
- Why would they be thinking
like that?

25:39.497 --> 25:42.625
I think they're happy.
- It's all based on the table.

25:42.667 --> 25:45.587
And then the hanging roses,
you know, are always--

25:45.628 --> 25:47.756
- I'm not wild about that.
- Okay.

25:47.797 --> 25:49.716
- What do you think?
I feel like it's hungry.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.634
- I can't tell. Hungry?
- Uh-huh.

25:51.676 --> 25:55.263
Like, "I'm so cool."
I don't know.

25:55.305 --> 25:58.016
- Well, couldn't it have been
the bee?

25:58.058 --> 26:01.436
- These gorgeous
fluffy hydrangeas

26:01.478 --> 26:03.897
that would fill the whole
walkway when you're walking.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.358
- Those are fresh.
- This is fresh. Not hungry.

26:06.399 --> 26:09.527
- It's like--
it's not hungry at all.

26:09.569 --> 26:13.323
That's so beautiful.
This is, to me, the vibe.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.492
- I love all this.
I think it's so chic.

26:15.533 --> 26:16.951
- Mm-hmm.

26:16.993 --> 26:20.914
- But I'm also thinking
I want something more like me.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.501
Like, Burning Man.
Like, that style wedding.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.130
- What do you mean?

26:29.172 --> 26:30.840
- Like,
everyone in neon colors.

26:30.882 --> 26:34.344
Like, glow in the dark for my
last hurrah of my wedding.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.973
- I mean, it's your wedding,
but--I'm getting hot.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.934
[laughter]
I'm ready to cry.

26:40.975 --> 26:42.644
- You look like
you're gonna kill yourself.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.396
So I just wanna--I was joking.
- So depressing.

26:44.437 --> 26:46.064
- I was joking.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.816
- This one loves
to pull my tail.

26:47.857 --> 26:50.652
And you know what?
She likes to stir the pot too.

26:50.694 --> 26:52.946

Look at the face.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.114

26:54.155 --> 26:55.407
- She does.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.076
What kind of food
do you think you'd like?

26:58.118 --> 26:59.786
- Snacks.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.329
- And what does he want?

27:01.371 --> 27:03.289
- Like, a 20-course meal.
- He wants--

27:03.331 --> 27:04.582
- He loves having, like,

27:04.624 --> 27:06.042
dinners where
everyone's sitting.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.377
I'm like,
"No one wants to eat."

27:07.419 --> 27:08.461
- No, people like to eat.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.338
- Okay then.
[laughs]

27:10.380 --> 27:15.093
- Yeah, we met once with Carter
and Paris just to download

27:15.135 --> 27:16.678
a little bit of kind of--

27:16.720 --> 27:18.805
- When did you--
when did you guys meet?

27:20.181 --> 27:21.349
- A while ago.

27:21.391 --> 27:23.268
- Can we talk what a budget

27:23.309 --> 27:25.145
would look like
on Beverly Hills Hotel?

27:25.186 --> 27:27.397
I assume they'll discount

27:27.439 --> 27:29.649
the nicer rooms
less than the standard room.

27:29.691 --> 27:31.443
You had the block
at half price.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.694
How late do you have the room?

27:32.736 --> 27:34.446
I think, what, like,
an open bar package

27:34.487 --> 27:36.364
at Beverly Hills Hotel's
probably...

27:36.406 --> 27:39.075
40 bucks a person per hour.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.326
- 'Cause I never met Carter.

27:40.368 --> 27:41.995
<i>[tense music]</i>

27:42.037 --> 27:43.913
- I didn't tell my mom that
Carter and I met with Mindy

27:43.955 --> 27:46.708
because I knew that
she'd be sad and feel left out.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.543
And I just didn't feel
like hurting her feelings.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.045
- He's the groom, right?

27:50.086 --> 27:52.672

- Yes.

27:58.970 --> 28:00.513

28:00.555 --> 28:03.892
I felt that it was unusual,
to say the least.

28:03.933 --> 28:07.771
- We really have to decide
whether it's traditional,

28:07.812 --> 28:11.066
and it will all depend
on the church if you think--

28:11.107 --> 28:14.819
- Yeah, I just want that, like,
romantic, ethereal vibe.

28:14.861 --> 28:18.156
- So maybe what we'd try to do
in the next couple of days

28:18.198 --> 28:21.743
is go by, see Father Ed...

28:21.785 --> 28:23.078

29:27.434 --> 29:30.812
- I just wanted to see you.

29:30.854 --> 29:32.731
I feel like all I've been
doing lately is stressing

29:32.772 --> 29:35.150
about my wedding,
and I just need a break.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.068
So I'm gonna go hang out
with my brother Barron

29:37.110 --> 29:39.612
<i>because he's one of the only</i>
<i>few people that I trust.</i>

29:39.654 --> 29:42.115
He never judges me
and always gives good advice.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.744
- So tell me more about--

29:45.785 --> 29:47.245
how's the wedding
planning going?

29:47.287 --> 29:48.496
What's--

29:48.538 --> 29:50.165
- Carter's been, like,
really pushing me

29:50.206 --> 29:52.417
'cause Mom's been traveling.

29:52.459 --> 29:53.668
She was in Europe.

29:53.710 --> 29:55.837
So it was hard
to, like, plan things

29:55.879 --> 29:57.380
I think 'cause Mom wasn't there

29:57.422 --> 29:58.757
so she didn't really want
to do it

29:58.798 --> 29:59.883
because she wanted to be there.

29:59.924 --> 30:02.010
You know how she is.
- Yeah.

30:02.052 --> 30:04.012
- He calls me
the absentee bride

30:04.054 --> 30:05.847
because he said
I haven't planned anything.

30:05.889 --> 30:08.600
He's like, and if it's up to me
and my mom,

30:08.641 --> 30:10.894
that we're never gonna
even have a wedding

30:10.935 --> 30:13.646
because nothing's happening.

30:13.688 --> 30:15.607
So he's been calling,
like, everyone.

30:15.648 --> 30:19.611
Like, hotels, venues...

30:19.652 --> 30:21.488
Not priests.

The photographer.

- Mickey Dickey. Oh, my God.

When is the last time
we've been to McDonald's?

30:37.462 --> 30:39.798
- Used to come here all
the time when we were little.

30:39.839 --> 30:43.176
- Yeah, Tessa does not
let me go to McDonald's.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.386
- Don't tell Carter either,

30:44.427 --> 30:46.221
because I'm on
the Prolon Cleanse with him.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.391
- The Prolon?
- It's, like, soups and olives.

30:49.432 --> 30:50.600
It's good, but I'm just--

30:50.642 --> 30:51.935
- Soups and olives?

and, like, vitamins.

It's good, but I'm starving
and want, like, McDonald's.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.402

the Oreo Slurpee--

31:09.536 --> 31:10.704

31:10.745 --> 31:11.913

- A classic.

31:14.124 --> 31:16.584
- It's so good.

31:16.626 --> 31:19.004
A number 4A.

- I'll do a number seven
with Mac sauce and extra onion.

31:34.728 --> 31:35.812
- Tessa's gonna be like,

31:35.854 --> 31:37.564
"Where did
that onion come from?"

31:37.605 --> 31:39.357

35:05.647 --> 35:09.109
and I started sneaking out
at night, ditching school,

35:09.150 --> 35:12.946
<i>and my parents,</i>
<i>they got really scared.</i>

35:12.987 --> 35:15.448
<i>So they sent me</i>
<i>to a boarding school.</i>

35:15.490 --> 35:20.120
They didn't realize
it was pure torture camp.

35:20.161 --> 35:25.208
I was verbally, physically,

35:25.250 --> 35:29.796
emotionally, psychologically
just abused on a daily basis.

35:30.547 --> 35:33.299
So what did you think
when I was gone?

35:33.341 --> 35:34.801
- I thought it was
boarding school.

35:34.843 --> 35:37.095
Like, I was so young,
you know--

35:37.137 --> 35:38.138
<i>- Couldn't do anything.</i>

35:38.179 --> 35:40.640
I couldn't tell my parents,

35:40.682 --> 35:43.309
because these places
manipulate the parents

35:43.351 --> 35:45.311
just as much
as they do the children.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.815
Anytime I bring it up with mom,
she's, like--

35:48.857 --> 35:50.358
won't even talk about it.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.153
She's like...

35:53.194 --> 35:55.196
"I was scared.
You needed to go."

35:55.238 --> 35:57.449
Just--I wasn't even
doing anything.

35:57.490 --> 36:00.326
I think just 'cause
I'm the first daughter

36:00.368 --> 36:03.913
and moving to New York--
like, being in LA,

36:03.955 --> 36:06.833
having such, like,
this strict life

36:06.875 --> 36:10.045
where I was very sheltered
and not able to go anywhere,

36:10.086 --> 36:11.671
and then moving to New York
all of a sudden

36:11.713 --> 36:15.425
and living at the Waldorf,
being able to sneak out

36:15.467 --> 36:18.511
and get into every single
night club in New York

36:18.553 --> 36:23.725
and be living the life
of, like, a 21-year-old at 16,

36:23.767 --> 36:27.062
she was just scared.

36:27.103 --> 36:29.022
I would be terrified too.
Like, I think about it now.

36:29.064 --> 36:31.191
I'm like, I understand
why they were scared.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.068
'Cause if I had a daughter
who was 16

36:33.109 --> 36:35.195
and she was sneaking out

36:35.236 --> 36:37.197
and going to all these places,
like,

36:37.238 --> 36:41.534
I wouldn't want her around
that crowd or any of that.

36:41.576 --> 36:44.746
So even though I was mad
that she was so strict,

36:44.788 --> 36:48.416
I feel like I'm gonna be
the strictest mom as well.

36:48.458 --> 36:52.045
I will no longer be silent,
and I'm gonna use my voice

36:52.087 --> 36:55.131
and use my platform
and make a change

36:55.173 --> 36:59.260
and be the hero
that I needed when I was there.

37:02.555 --> 37:03.973
It's so crazy.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.810
I can't believe it's,
like--I even went through that.

37:06.851 --> 37:08.311
It's like,
how is that real life?

37:08.353 --> 37:11.398
Like, that's why I spoke up.

37:11.439 --> 37:13.400
'Cause if I didn't
say anything,

37:13.441 --> 37:15.443
like, I don't know who would.

37:15.485 --> 37:18.029
Imagine if I just held that in
the rest of my life

37:18.071 --> 37:20.323
and never said anything.

37:20.365 --> 37:22.534
Probably would have been alone,
still, and single

37:22.575 --> 37:25.495
because I didn't want to let
anyone in or trust anyone.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.455
- I think that's
the most important thing.

37:27.497 --> 37:30.792
And of course that helped
so many people, you know?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.752
- Have you talked to Mom
about it?

37:32.794 --> 37:35.046
- Um...

37:35.088 --> 37:36.381
- No?

37:36.423 --> 37:40.760
- No, they don't really talk
about it.

37:40.802 --> 37:45.724
Do you feel like you got
closure from Mom and Dad?

37:45.765 --> 37:48.309
- I just feel like they just
don't want to think about it,

37:48.351 --> 37:50.311
just like I didn't want
to think about it

37:50.353 --> 37:52.105
and didn't talk about it
for 20 years

37:52.147 --> 37:55.275
'cause I just--
it's painful to think about--

37:55.316 --> 37:57.027
to, like, open that up.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.111
- Yeah.

37:58.153 --> 38:00.905
- Every time I bring Provo...

38:00.947 --> 38:03.324
every time I bring Provo up--

38:03.366 --> 38:07.454
every time I bring Provo up,
my mom changes the subject.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.581
So it's something--I don't...

38:14.252 --> 38:16.004
I forgot what I was saying.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.255
I don't want to hurt
her feelings.

38:17.297 --> 38:19.799
I don't want to upset her.

38:19.841 --> 38:22.635
<i>It's something I didn't</i>
<i>even realize till now,</i>

38:22.677 --> 38:25.305
but I noticed it
just when I'm in the interviews

38:25.347 --> 38:28.558
or when I do interviews
or if I'm--

38:28.600 --> 38:30.060
<i>anything with public speaking,</i>

38:30.101 --> 38:35.106
I need to, like, say exactly
word-for-word what I'm told.

38:35.148 --> 38:37.442
<i>Because being abused</i>
<i>at these schools</i>

38:37.484 --> 38:40.403
and being, you know, punished
for saying the wrong thing

38:40.445 --> 38:42.155
or doing the wrong thing
or not saying

38:42.197 --> 38:45.283
or doing it exactly right--

38:45.325 --> 38:46.534
I'm, like, talking serious

38:46.576 --> 38:48.411
with, like, a unicorn
on my head.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.662
[laughs]

38:49.704 --> 38:51.664
Is...

38:51.706 --> 38:55.210
makes me very anxious
and nervous.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.628
And I don't know.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.797
It's something I need
to work on for sure.

38:58.838 --> 39:00.173
'Cause I don't want to--

39:00.215 --> 39:01.716
I just want to be able
to speak freely.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.426
I'm not a dumb person.

39:03.468 --> 39:05.011
Like, I know
exactly what's going on.

39:05.053 --> 39:06.513
I can articulate myself.

39:06.554 --> 39:08.390
<i>I am thinking so many things</i>

39:08.431 --> 39:11.643
and it's just--
I'm just sick of it.

39:11.685 --> 39:14.020
I just want just to say
what I want to feel--

39:14.062 --> 39:17.107
what I feel
and not be so closed off

39:17.148 --> 39:20.360
and, like, not--I don't know,
not robotic,

39:20.402 --> 39:22.445
but, like, almost like a...

39:25.281 --> 39:27.200
Like a Barbie doll or something

39:27.242 --> 39:29.244
that's just played with
and told what to do.

39:31.663 --> 39:33.373
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>till now why.</i>

39:33.415 --> 39:35.291
<i>But now I'm just realizing.</i>

39:37.544 --> 39:41.464
I'm just realizing so much,
which is good.

39:41.506 --> 39:43.049
'Cause I think that's,
you know,

39:43.091 --> 39:45.427
one of the first steps
of healing

39:45.468 --> 39:48.972
or figuring something out
is to identify the problem

39:49.014 --> 39:51.099
and, you know,
what the issue is.

39:52.350 --> 39:56.896
- So have you, like,
had a sit down,

39:56.938 --> 39:59.024
just, like, the three of you?

39:59.065 --> 40:00.233
- No.

40:00.275 --> 40:02.193
<i>[somber music]</i>

40:02.235 --> 40:04.863
I don't really know
what to say.

40:04.904 --> 40:08.658
- Perhaps just, like, having
that conversation

40:08.700 --> 40:11.578
just to lay it out,

40:11.619 --> 40:13.621
just to let them know
how you feel.

40:14.831 --> 40:17.334
- It's hard.
- Yeah, it's not easy.

40:17.375 --> 40:18.835
- They don't like it.

40:18.877 --> 40:21.087
They don't like talking
about things, really.

40:21.129 --> 40:22.380
You know how Mom is.

40:22.422 --> 40:25.342
Mom is just so fun
and, like, chill

40:25.383 --> 40:27.260
and she doesn't really like
to get serious.

40:27.302 --> 40:29.888
Like, I've never really had,
like, a serious,

40:29.929 --> 40:32.599
like, deep conversation
about things like that.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.394
She's just--she doesn't like
to think about bad things.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.188
She just likes to be happy.

40:38.229 --> 40:39.731
- Yeah.

40:39.773 --> 40:43.443
- It's how she is.
I don't want to kill her vibe.

40:43.485 --> 40:45.945
[laughs]
- I know, but that's--

40:45.987 --> 40:50.116
it could be worth exploring.

40:50.158 --> 40:53.661
- Well...one day.

40:53.703 --> 40:56.623
My parents feel bad
and regret sending me to Provo,

40:56.664 --> 40:59.125
but I don't think
that they really understand

40:59.167 --> 41:00.377
what I went through

41:00.418 --> 41:02.462
because they never watched
the documentary,

41:02.504 --> 41:05.340
so they don't really know
all the details.

41:05.382 --> 41:08.468
So I wish we could just--
one day just sit down

41:08.510 --> 41:10.428
and have a real conversation.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.472
I just need to get
the wedding planned first.

41:12.514 --> 41:16.101
I don't want to, like,
cause any drama before that.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.395
<i>You know, for so long</i>
<i>since I was a teenager,</i>

41:18.436 --> 41:21.147
I've really been
just holding all this in.

41:21.189 --> 41:24.442
And, you know,
I'm about to get married,

41:24.484 --> 41:27.445
and I really just wish
we could just talk about it

41:27.487 --> 41:29.072
so I can just let it go.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.657
Because I feel like
I don't know

41:30.699 --> 41:35.203
if I'll fully ever release this
unless we speak about it.

41:36.371 --> 41:39.541
What would you do
if Milou was sneaking out?

41:39.582 --> 41:42.419
- Oh man.

41:42.460 --> 41:46.131
I don't know,
but I'd try and just, like--

41:46.172 --> 41:47.340
I don't know.

41:47.382 --> 41:48.883
- Talk to her?
- Talk to her. Exactly.

41:48.925 --> 41:52.053
Communication.
That's always a good thing.

41:52.095 --> 41:56.516
- I'm so happy for you.
I'm so proud of you. Really.

41:56.558 --> 41:58.852
You guys are
such a beautiful couple,

41:58.893 --> 42:01.688
and I just see that you bring
out the best in each other,

42:01.730 --> 42:03.523
and then just seeing you
as a dad

42:03.565 --> 42:05.608
and just, like, the way
you look at Milou,

42:05.650 --> 42:07.193
and it just makes
my heart melt.

42:07.235 --> 42:11.281
I'm like, "I can't believe
my baby brother is a grownup."

42:11.322 --> 42:12.866
- All you have is family.

42:12.907 --> 42:16.286
Friends come and go,
but family is forever.

42:16.327 --> 42:18.580
- I know.

42:18.621 --> 42:22.208
[laughs]

42:22.250 --> 42:24.085
I'm so full of McDonald's.

42:24.127 --> 42:26.588
- Yeah.
[both laugh]
