WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:04.405
(siren wailing)

00:04.438 --> 00:08.076
***

00:11.445 --> 00:16.517
(Meredith) THE HUMAN BODY
IS A HIGHLY PRESSURIZED SYSTEM.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.819
***

00:18.852 --> 00:21.422
THE BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURES
THE FORCE OF BLOOD

00:21.455 --> 00:23.824
PULSATING
THROUGH THE ARTERIES.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.593
(hisses)
GREAT.

00:25.626 --> 00:28.229
WHAT THE HELL
AM I GONNA DO NOW?!
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP
THIS PRESSURE REGULATED.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.764
DAMN IT!

00:30.798 --> 00:31.865
DAMN IT!

00:31.899 --> 00:34.768
WHEN A HEART WASN'T AVAILABLE,
I OPTED TO CONTINUE

00:34.802 --> 00:36.770
WITH ROY HENLEY'S
LUNG TRANSPLANT...

00:36.804 --> 00:40.308
LOW OR INADEQUATE PRESSURE
CAN CAUSE WEAKNESS OR FAILURE.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.176
IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.178
MY NAME ISN'T ON
THE O.R. BOARD.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.747
I CHECKED THE SCHEDULE.
NOBODY WANTS TO WORK WITH ME,

00:46.780 --> 00:49.350
'CAUSE I'M NOT ON
ANYBODY'S SERVICE.
IT'S AN OVERSIGHT, OKAY?
JUST--JUST ASK AROUND.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.086
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY THINGS I'VE
SCREWED UP IN THE LAST MONTH?

00:52.120 --> 00:54.622
STOP IT. I'M SERIOUS.
JUST ASK AROUND

00:54.655 --> 00:57.758
AND GET ON SOMEONE'S SERVICE
AND GET BACK TO WORK.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.760
(Teddy) ...SUGGESTED
NO PULMONARY SEPSIS.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.629
YOU SMELL LIKE
YOU'RE SWEATING BOOZE.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.265
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WANT THE WEEKEND YOU HAD.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.167
WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS,
YOU KNOW?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.103
HEY, WHO'S STARK? I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE ON STARK'S SERVICE TODAY.

01:09.137 --> 01:11.105
OH, ME, TOO.
HE'S THE NEW PEDS ATTENDING,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.774
SINCE ROBBINS LEFT.
(Alex whispers) CRAP.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.310
(normal voice) I CAN'T HANDLE
A BUNCH OF SICK KIDS TODAY.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.845
I CAN'T DO IT.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.880
SO WAS IT
A BACHELOR PARTY OR--

01:19.913 --> 01:21.849
SHH.
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CRISTINA.
OH.

01:21.882 --> 01:24.885
IT BECAME CLEAR TO DR. YANG

01:24.918 --> 01:26.887
THAT THEY WERE GONNA NEED
TO SWITCH MODALITIES.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.889
THE PATIENT WAS PUT ON ECMO...

01:28.922 --> 01:30.424
IT'S WHEN THE PRESSURE
GETS TOO HIGH

01:30.458 --> 01:32.426
THAT PROBLEMS REALLY OCCUR.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.827
AND WHY DID DR. YANG

01:33.861 --> 01:37.231
OPT TO USE THE INTRA-AORTIC
BALLOON PUMP OVER AN R-VAD?

01:37.265 --> 01:38.766
I, UM...

01:38.799 --> 01:41.469
I CAN'T ANSWER FOR DR. YANG.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.903
AND WHY ISN'T SHE HERE?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.838
SHE, UM...

01:44.872 --> 01:46.440
(feedback chirps)

01:46.474 --> 01:48.776
SHE QUIT.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.378
SHE LEFT THE PROGRAM.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.346
I'M SORRY. WHAT? SHE WHAT?
(doctors murmuring)

01:52.380 --> 01:55.349
DR. YANG CLEARED THE BALLOON
PUMP WITH DR. McQUEEN...
(cell phone ringing)

01:55.383 --> 01:57.885
WHO AGREED THAT IT WAS
THE BEST--

01:57.918 --> 01:59.887
GO BACK. GO BACK.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.257
YANG QUIT THE PROGRAM?
YEAH, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:03.291 --> 02:05.259
WELL, THAT'S THE FIRST
I'VE HEARD OF IT.
(beeps)

02:05.293 --> 02:07.261
HUNT, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
SHE TOLD THE CHIEF SHE QUIT.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.231
RICHARD--
(Teddy) IF WE COULD JUST FINISH
THE PRESENTATION, THEN--

02:10.264 --> 02:12.800
(Derek) I HAVE A QUESTION.
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

02:12.833 --> 02:16.504
YOUR DECISION TO PUT DR. YANG
IN CHARGE OF THIS PATIENT?
SORRY?

02:16.537 --> 02:20.174
(door opens and closes)
BUT SHE DIDN'T "QUIT" QUIT,
RIGHT?

02:20.208 --> 02:22.176
GREY.

02:22.210 --> 02:25.879
YOU'RE JOINED AT THE HIP.
WHAT'D SHE SAY?

02:25.913 --> 02:29.283
UH, SHE HASN'T SPOKEN
TO ME ABOUT IT.

02:29.317 --> 02:31.219
IF THE PRESSURE CONTINUES
TO INCREASE,

02:31.252 --> 02:33.221
A CLOSER EXAMINATION
IS CALLED FOR...

02:33.254 --> 02:35.823
STOP LOOKING AT ME.
LOOK UP THERE.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.459
DOES TORRES KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS?

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
I'M CALLING TORRES.
(keypad beeping)

02:40.494 --> 02:41.862
CAN WE PLEASE JUST--

02:41.895 --> 02:44.832
LOOK, I GUESS I'M ASKING YOU,
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE

02:44.865 --> 02:47.568
TO PUT DR. YANG UNDER
SO MUCH PRESSURE THAT DAY?
I DIDN'T.
I INTENDED THE OPPOSITE.

02:47.601 --> 02:49.837
(door opens)
I GAVE HER
A SIMPLE PRE-OP CHECKLIST

02:49.870 --> 02:51.439
ON A STABLE PATIENT.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.507
(door closes)
STABLE PATIENT?

02:53.541 --> 02:56.877
THE PATIENT ALMOST DIED TWICE.
I COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.379
***

02:58.412 --> 03:01.549
I'M SORRY. IS THIS A, UH,
A PATIENT PRESENTATION

03:01.582 --> 03:03.884
OR A POSTMORTEM
ON DR. YANG?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.886
WELL, YOU SAVED THE PATIENT.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.489
BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST INDICATOR

03:08.522 --> 03:13.827
THAT SOMETHING
IS GOING TERRIBLY WRONG.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.429
(blows nose)

03:15.463 --> 03:18.198
(objects clatter)

03:19.933 --> 03:22.336
(sighs)

03:28.509 --> 03:29.943
(box thuds)

03:29.977 --> 03:33.347
(inhales deeply)

03:33.381 --> 03:35.649
(exhales deeply)

03:37.885 --> 03:38.986
(sighs)

03:39.019 --> 03:42.856
(cell phone rings)

03:42.890 --> 03:47.861
(ring)

03:47.895 --> 03:49.497
(ring)

03:49.530 --> 03:51.299
(sighs)

03:51.332 --> 03:52.433
(beeps)

03:52.466 --> 03:55.303
HEY, MARK.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.005
NO, NO, I WAS, UM...

03:58.038 --> 04:00.874
I WAS ACTUALLY ON MY WAY OUT.
WHAT'S UP?

04:00.908 --> 04:03.544
(siren wailing)

04:03.577 --> 04:05.045
SHE WHAT?!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.047
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHEPHERD'S PROBLEM IS.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.050
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
HOW IS SHE DOING? IS SHE--

04:10.083 --> 04:12.019
OH, WE'RE--I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S--

04:12.052 --> 04:14.355
WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE FINE.
IT'S LIKE NOTHING HAS CHANGED,

04:14.388 --> 04:16.357
YET SHE REFUSES
TO TALK ABOUT WORK.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.059
I BRING UP WORK,
AND SHE GOES BLANK.
ALTMAN, HUNT.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.028
EMERGENT PATIENT
TEN MINUTES OUT.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.931
CAN YOU MEET ME
IN THE V.I.P. WING?
V.I.P. WING? WHO IS IT?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.634
OH, YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHEN WE GET THERE.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.702
LISTEN, HUNT, I'M REQUIRED
TO SEND A LETTER

04:28.736 --> 04:32.540
TO THE AMERICAN BOARD OF SURGERY
DECLARING THAT DR. YANG

04:32.573 --> 04:34.308
HAS OFFICIALLY LEFT
THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.410
I HAVE TO LET 'EM KNOW.
I'M ASKING YOU,

04:36.444 --> 04:38.979
IS THERE ANY REASON I NEED TO
HOLD OFF ON SENDING THAT LETTER?

04:39.012 --> 04:40.348
YES.
YES.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.350
PLEASE DON'T MAIL IT.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.953
JUST GIVE US
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.988
OKAY. LET'S GO.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.590
RIGHT.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.961
GREY,
WHO ARE YOU WITH TODAY?

04:53.994 --> 04:54.928
SHEPHERD.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.897
DAMN IT. I'VE ALREADY
BLOWN IT WITH SHEPHERD.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.467
I CAN'T ASK HIM.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.935
UH... BAILEY. I HAVEN'T
BLOWN IT WITH HER YET.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.937
HE THINKS NO ONE WANTS
TO WORK WITH HIM.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.607
ARE THEY SAYING THAT
OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT?
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.609
WHO ARE YOU WITH AGAIN?
KAREV.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.744
UH, I MEAN STARK.
NO, YOU MEANT KAREV.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.080
I--
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO THERE.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.016
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'M GOING.
HE'S RIGHT.
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THERE.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.885
I'M NOT--
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.354
HE'S NOT THE GUY FOR YOU.
OKAY? TRUST ME.
(laughs)

05:20.388 --> 05:22.623
AND DON'T BE PARANOID.
TRUST ME ON THAT, TOO.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.559
(people speaking indistinctly)

05:25.593 --> 05:28.028
OH, BUT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU
TO GO THERE?

05:28.061 --> 05:30.097
I'M A GUY. I LIVE THERE.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.732
(elevator bell dings)

05:31.765 --> 05:34.602
I GOTTA FIND BAILEY.
(sighs)

05:34.635 --> 05:37.405
(Metric) * SLOW IT DOWN,
PUSH IT TO THE EAST COAST *

05:37.438 --> 05:38.939
* TOUCH DOWN, LOOK AROUND,
EVERYONE'S THE SAME *

05:38.972 --> 05:40.541
HELLO!

05:40.574 --> 05:44.077
CRISTINA!

05:44.111 --> 05:46.146
OH, HEY. HELLO.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.982
HELLO!

05:49.016 --> 05:51.084

05:54.922 --> 05:56.690
UH... WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.892
I'M NOT BACK
UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.428
WAIT. SO IT'S TRUE?

06:00.461 --> 06:02.530
YOU GUYS BROKE UP?
UH, SHE'S IN AFRICA?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.132
OKAY, SLOAN TOLD ME
THAT YOU QUIT.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.468
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

06:07.501 --> 06:09.069
THIS. GO AWAY.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.406
OKAY, THIS IS DISTURBING.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.007
HEY, STOP!

06:14.041 --> 06:17.010
(music stops)

06:17.044 --> 06:19.146
LOOK, I WAS UNPACKING,

06:19.179 --> 06:21.148
BUT THEN I DIDN'T ENJOY IT.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.750
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:22.783 --> 06:26.053
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB TO GO TO.
YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND

06:26.086 --> 06:28.889
TELLING YOU
YOU HAVE TO GO TO AFRICA.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.559
YOU'RE COMPLETELY FREE.
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.528
THE WORLD IS YOUR OYSTER.
MAKE LEMONADE.
I'M TRYING. I WAS GONNA
GET MY HAIR CUT TODAY,

06:34.562 --> 06:36.964
LIKE, MAKE A RADICAL CHANGE,
BUT, UH, THEN I THOUGHT,

06:36.997 --> 06:39.667
HMM, MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T DO RADICAL THINGS

06:39.700 --> 06:41.669
RIGHT AFTER A BLONDE WOMAN

06:41.702 --> 06:43.671
HAS RIPPED YOUR HEART
OUT OF YOUR CHEST

06:43.704 --> 06:46.440
AND STOMPED ON IT.
WHAT ARE YOU-- (gasps)

06:46.474 --> 06:48.442
OH, MY GOD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
(laughs)

06:48.476 --> 06:50.478
ARE YOU INSANE?!

06:50.511 --> 06:52.012
LET'S MAKE LEMONADE.

06:52.045 --> 06:55.015
(laughing)
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

06:55.048 --> 06:58.085
(beeping)

06:58.118 --> 07:00.988
OH, 97.6

07:01.021 --> 07:02.623
STICK OUT YOUR TONGUE.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.957
(thud)

07:03.991 --> 07:05.759
OW! CUT IT OUT.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.160
WE'LL HAVE FUN TODAY.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.030
STARK'S A GOT A 4-MONTH-OLD
BILIARY ATRESIA PATIENT

07:10.063 --> 07:11.532
WHO JUST FOUND A DONOR.

07:11.565 --> 07:14.167
(groans) A LIVER TRANSPLANT
ON AN INFANT?

07:14.201 --> 07:18.038
ENOUGH WITH
THE DAMN PING-PONG BALLS!

07:18.071 --> 07:18.872
JERKFACE!

07:18.906 --> 07:22.610
WHOA. INSIDE VOICES HERE,

07:22.643 --> 07:24.612
SO YOU MUST BE DR. KAREV.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.146
YOU MISSED MY ROUNDS TODAY.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.749
OH, SORRY.
I-I HAD CAR TROUBLE.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.751
OH. WELL, THERE'S A CLASSIC.

07:30.784 --> 07:35.022
SO WHAT, YOU'RE HERE JUST TO

07:35.055 --> 07:36.657

07:36.690 --> 07:39.660
LOOK, D-DR. STARK,
I AM FEELING VERY SICK TODAY.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.995
SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU HAVE KEPNER--

07:42.029 --> 07:44.565
(beeping)
WELL, LET'S SEE HERE.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.601
(pop, thud)
NO FEVER. YOU DON'T SEEM

07:47.635 --> 07:49.703
YOU RETAINING CONTROL
OF YOUR BOWELS?
EW.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.539
YES.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.541
WELL, SINCE HANGOVERS
ARE NOT CONTAGIOUS,

07:53.574 --> 07:54.942
I'D SAY YOU'RE WORKING.

07:54.975 --> 07:59.079
AND YOU CAN START
BY PREPPING MY ATRESIA KID.

07:59.112 --> 08:04.017
SHE'S ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD,
SO TRY NOT TO BE A JERKFACE.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.621
(ping-pong ball
clatters on floor)

08:07.655 --> 08:09.723
GIMMIE THAT!

08:09.757 --> 08:12.593
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

08:12.626 --> 08:14.595
DR. WEBBER,
RONALD DACE, STATE DEPARTMENT.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.730
WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE.
THESE YOUR SURGEONS?

08:16.764 --> 08:19.733
UH, YES, THIS IS DOCTOR--
RIGHT NOW, WE NEED
TO LIMIT ACCESS TO THIS AREA

08:19.767 --> 08:22.135
TO ONLY ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL.
UH, WHY IS THAT NECESSARY?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.204
NO ONE CAN KNOW THIS MAN
IS BEING HOSPITALIZED.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.207
NO ONE CAN KNOW
HE'S IN THE COUNTRY.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.677
(men speaking foreign language)

08:29.710 --> 08:33.146
(speaking foreign language)

08:33.180 --> 08:36.016
(Owen) EVERYONE, STOP.
SOMEONE GET THE PADDLES.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.185
(Teddy) BOARD.
GET ME A READING.

08:38.218 --> 08:41.088
GOT IT.
STAND BY WHERE YOU ARE.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.790
HE'S IN V-FIB.
CHARGE TO 200.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.193
(man speaking foreign language)

08:46.226 --> 08:48.328
AND FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,

08:48.361 --> 08:51.064
IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF HE DIDN'T DIE.
(defibrillator whines)

08:51.098 --> 08:53.166
CLEAR.
(thunks)

09:01.274 --> 09:03.010
CLEAR!
(paddles thunk)

09:03.043 --> 09:04.678
THEY FAXED
MORE OF HIS RECORDS.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.614
(monitor beeping erratically)
THESE ARE ALL IN ARABIC.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.281
CLEAR!
(thunks)

09:08.315 --> 09:10.718
IT WAS A CAR ACCIDENT?
THE EMIR'S CAR

09:10.751 --> 09:13.053
WAS HIT BY A TRUCK
AS HE WAS LEAVING THE MEETING.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.988
WHAT'S HE DOING IN SEATTLE?
HE'S NOT.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.990
LET IT SUFFICE TO SAY,
IF HE DIES,

09:17.024 --> 09:19.593
WE'VE GOT A SERIOUS
INTERNATIONAL INCIDENT.
WELL, NOT TO MENTION,

09:19.627 --> 09:22.029
HIS PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO SEE
THEIR FIRST ELECTIONS, RIGHT?

09:22.062 --> 09:25.132
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO D--
UNLESS HE DIES, IN WHICH CASE,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.900
THEN THE DOOR IS OPEN
FOR AL QAEDA TO MOVE IN,

09:26.934 --> 09:31.204
AND THEN YOUR SECRET MEETING
WAS FOR NOTHING.
YOU DON'T JUST SKIP
TO THE CROSSWORD, DO YOU?

09:31.238 --> 09:34.141
WELL, I USED TO WORK
IN THAT NECK OF THE WOODS.
I KNOW, DR. ALTMAN--
THREE YEARS IN BAGHDAD,

09:34.174 --> 09:36.677
TWO YEARS IN LANDSTUHL.
WOW. YOU GUYS ARE FAST.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.211
WE ARE.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.248
LISTEN, OUR BEST OUTCOME HERE
IS THAT WE GET HIM STABLE ENOUGH

09:41.281 --> 09:43.383
TO BE PUT ON A PLANE HOME.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.385
OUR BEST OUTCOME
IS WE SAVE HIM.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.387
(man)
HE TAKES TWO MEDICATIONS--

09:47.420 --> 09:49.256
ONE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
ONE FOR HIS CHOLESTEROL.

09:49.289 --> 09:53.694
UH, HE WAS HOSPITALIZED
LATE LAST YEAR FOR EXHAUSTION.
DID HE RECEIVE
ANY TREATMENT THEN?

09:53.727 --> 09:55.663
NO, JUST REST.
WORKING TOO HARD.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.064
HE WORKS VERY HARD.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.100
UH, HE HAS A WIFE,
FOUR CHILDREN...

10:00.133 --> 10:02.670
FIVE, UH, IF YOU COUNT ME.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.672
HE'S MORE THAN MY BOSS.
HE'S BEEN, UM...

10:04.705 --> 10:07.240
(voice breaks) HE'S GIVEN ME
EVERYTHING, SO PLEASE...

10:07.274 --> 10:10.010
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.679
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:11.712 --> 10:13.280
HE'S IN V-FIB.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.048
ALL RIGHT, CHARGE TO 300.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.149
CLEAR!

10:16.183 --> 10:18.118
(thunks)

10:18.151 --> 10:21.855
(babies crying)

10:21.889 --> 10:23.857
WE'LL BRING
YOUR BABY UP SOON.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.392
LISA. HER NAME IS LISA.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.127
THE DONOR WAS AN ADULT,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.730
SO THE LIVER WILL ACTUALLY
BE SPLIT BETWEEN YOUR BABY--

10:29.763 --> 10:32.332
LISA. SORRY. WE READ THAT

10:32.365 --> 10:34.668
IF THE DOCTOR KNOWS
YOUR BABY'S NAME,

10:34.702 --> 10:37.304
IT HELPS YOU
TO KIND OF BOND WITH HER.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.307
WE READ THAT'S IMPORTANT.
WILL DR. STARK BE SPLITTING
THE LIVER IN SITU?

10:40.340 --> 10:42.743
WE KNOW THAT EX VIVO
TAKES LESS TIME,

10:42.776 --> 10:46.446
BUT WE ALSO READ THAT
IN SITU GIVES BETTER RESULTS.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.250
W-WE'RE NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB, WE--

10:50.283 --> 10:52.385
OH, NO, NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
PLEASE DON'T APOLOGIZE.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.221
WE'LL FIND OUT FOR YOU.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.324
(Stark speaks indistinctly,
video game sounds playing)
ONE SECOND.

10:57.357 --> 11:01.061
YEAH, YOU WANT TO BLOW UP AS
MANY OF THOSE GUYS AS YOU CAN.
DR. STARK.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.063
THERE YOU GO. YOU GOT IT.
YOU GOT IT.

11:03.096 --> 11:06.199
DR. STARK, UH, CAN YOU COME
TALK TO THE COLLISES, PLEASE?

11:06.233 --> 11:08.201
OH!
THEY'VE GOT
A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.203
YEAH, I GOTTA CHECK
ON THAT KID'S HARVEST TEAM.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.105
DID YOU EVER HANG GLIDE?
WHAT? I--NO.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.175
IT'S APPARENTLY A VERY GOOD WAY
TO BECOME A LIVER DONOR.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.177
WAIT, SIR,
ARE YOU SPLITTING THE LIVER

11:17.210 --> 11:20.113
IN THE BODY OR EX VIVO?
THE PARENTS WANT TO KNOW.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.248
OKAY.

11:21.281 --> 11:24.417
THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN SPENDING
A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME

11:24.451 --> 11:26.386
CONSULTING DR. INTERNET.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.122
LISTEN, JUST HOLD THEIR HANDS,
LET THEM FEEL SMART,

11:29.156 --> 11:32.425
AND TELL THEM I AM BUSY
GETTING THEIR BABY A LIVER.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.129
HER NAME'S LISA.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.131
I SAID I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.168
I'VE GOT AN EASY DAY--
TWO LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERIES.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.270
I CAN'T USE YOU.
YEAH, WELL, MAYBE I CAN--

11:43.303 --> 11:46.273
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
I CAN'T ADMIT YOU.
WELL, YOU DON'T NEED
TO ADMIT ME.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.442
I'LL JUST WALK IN THERE MYSELF.
I DO IT ALL THE TIME.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.211
OH--

11:51.244 --> 11:54.114
UH, CHIEF WEBBER PAGED ME
IN THERE.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.084
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
WELL, WHO'S IN THERE?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.186
IS IT THE PRESIDENT
OR THE VICE PRESIDENT?

11:59.219 --> 12:02.189
IS IT BONO?
BONO?

12:02.222 --> 12:05.358
MA'AM, I'M SORRY. I CANNOT--
BAILEY, CAN YOU TAKE
MY PATIENTS TODAY?

12:05.392 --> 12:08.061
I GOT A SITUATION IN HERE.
OH, OF COURSE, SIR.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.063
LOUISE CORTEZ IS A READMIT
AFTER SURGERY

12:10.097 --> 12:13.366
FOR CHRONIC PANCREATITIS. C.T.
SHOWED A PANCREATIC FISTULA.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.335
AND SHE SPIKED A FEVER
THIS MORNING.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.370
RIGHT. UH, SIR,
YOU PUT IN A DRAIN?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.372
YES, JUST KEEP
A CLOSE EYE.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.776
OKAY. SIR.
(bangs door)

12:22.810 --> 12:24.311
IS IT BONO?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.146
(elevator bell dings)

12:28.215 --> 12:29.416
COME ON, AVERY.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.152
I COULD USE YOU.
(whispers) YEAH.

12:32.185 --> 12:35.122
OKAY, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M ON YOUR SERVICE.
I DON'T NEED YOU.
THE CRANIOTOMY'S BEEN CANCELED.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.125
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.
SO WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.860
GO STUDY.
STUDY WHAT?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.395
I DON'T CARE, LEXIE.
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WH--

12:42.429 --> 12:44.164
OH, MY GOD. MM.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.133
HOW DO WE
HAVE TIME FOR THIS?

12:46.166 --> 12:48.068
WE HAVE TO MAKE TIME
FOR THIS. MM.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.103
SHOULD I CALL HER?
CALL WHO?

12:50.137 --> 12:52.505
CRISTINA.
WH-WH-WHY?

12:52.539 --> 12:55.308
BECAUSE SHE QUIT, AND I FEEL
LIKE I SHOULD DO SOMETHING.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.311
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
NO MATTER WHAT SHE SAYS.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.513
OKAY? YOU JUST NEED
TO MAKE TIME FOR THIS.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.215
BUT--

13:02.249 --> 13:05.185
(knock on door)
OH, MY GOD. LEXIE.

13:05.218 --> 13:05.953
WHAT?

13:05.986 --> 13:08.155
I'M LOOKING
FOR DR. MEREDITH GREY.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.095
WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:15.128 --> 13:17.197
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

13:17.230 --> 13:20.267
(scissors clicking)

13:23.270 --> 13:24.872
HOW'S IT GOING?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.240
(clicking continues)
CAN I SEE?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.909
FANTASTIC. SHUT UP.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.443
OKAY.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.579
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED

13:32.612 --> 13:34.581
TO, UH, GET THIS PLACE DONE?

13:34.614 --> 13:37.384
YOU NEED TO THROW
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.
(clicking stops)

13:37.417 --> 13:39.386
PUT A LITTLE PRESSURE
ON YOURSELF.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.255
OH, MY GOD. WE SHOULD TOTALLY
THROW A HOUSEWARMING PARTY.
MM-HMM. (laughs)

13:42.289 --> 13:44.257
OH, MY GOD!

13:44.291 --> 13:46.526
(car alarm blaring)

13:46.559 --> 13:49.329
OH, MY GOD, NO.
TONIGHT! I'LL TEXT EVERYONE.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.599
NO!
YES! I HAVE SEVERAL CREDIT CARDS
AND NOTHING TO DO.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.602
OKAY, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANTED.
I LOOK--I-I LOOK INJURED.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.438
I MEAN, DO YOU EVEN CUT HAIR?
I NEED FURNITURE.

13:58.471 --> 14:02.175
LOOK AT MY HAIR!
YEAH. I SORTA CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU LET ME DO THAT.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.311
CRISTINA!
IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL GO TO THE MALL.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.647
YOU MIGHT WANT A HAT.
(exhales)

14:07.680 --> 14:10.183
(monitor beeps erratically,
defibrillator whines)
CLEAR!

14:10.217 --> 14:13.453
(paddles thunk,
beeping normalizes)
WE NEED TO GET HIM
TO A CATH LAB.

14:13.486 --> 14:16.356
YEAH, WELL, IF HE'D
STOP CODING LONG ENOUGH.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.192
I'M INSERTING A PACEMAKER.
YOU PAGED?

14:19.226 --> 14:22.195
YEAH, GREY, GRAB ME
A PACEMAKER KIT.
(cell phone beeps)

14:22.229 --> 14:25.298
HEY, HUNT, YOU'RE THROWING
A HOUSEWARMING PARTY TONIGHT?
TONIGHT? I AM?

14:25.332 --> 14:28.168
WELL, YOUR WIFE IS.
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN, RIGHT?
IT'S A WEIRD SIGN.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.503
WELL, BUT MAYBE
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.640
I MEAN, MAYBE I COULD
TALK TO HER.
WAIT. BETTER YET,
MAYBE YOU COULD, GREY.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.375
WELL, WE ALL COULD.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.310
I MEAN,
IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR HER

14:37.344 --> 14:41.181
TO WALK OUT OF A ROOM
AT HER OWN PARTY.
HOW BAD IS IT?

14:41.214 --> 14:43.416
I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I KNOW.
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS
PARTY PLANNING.

14:43.450 --> 14:46.153
HEY, I DON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO POLISH YOUR SUNGLASSES.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.321
LOOK, BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.924
AND IT'D BE A SHAME
IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS

14:50.958 --> 14:53.160
SCREWED UP
WHAT HE WAS TRYING TO DO.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.196
WOW. EVERY TIME I TALK TO YOU,
I FEEL A LITTLE MORE RELAXED.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.431
THE LAST THING CRISTINA WANTS
IS TO TALK TO ME.

14:58.465 --> 15:01.434
I JUST HAVE TO GIVE HER
SOME SPACE.
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GIVE HER SPACE.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.470
SHE'S GONNA BE LOCKED OUT
OF THIS PROGRAM,

15:03.503 --> 15:06.173
AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
THAT IS WHAT SHE WANTS.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.708
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.244
I'M ASKING YOU, GREY.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.981
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

15:14.014 --> 15:16.984
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M DOING BACK HERE.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.619
DR. WEBBER SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A FIST.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.221
A FISTULA.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.223
IT'S A COMPLICATION
FROM YOUR SURGERY

15:23.256 --> 15:25.225
THAT'S LEAKING
PANCREATIC FLUID.

15:25.258 --> 15:28.228
THE DRAIN TAKES THE FLUID
OUT OF YOUR BODY

15:28.261 --> 15:30.430
SO IT WON'T GO
WHERE IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.265
OKAY.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.234
TH-THE PANCREATIC FLUID

15:34.267 --> 15:36.236
IS MADE TO DIGEST YOUR FOOD.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.238
IF IT LEAKS IN YOUR BODY,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.240
IT STARTS TO DIGEST
YOUR OTHER ORGANS.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.242
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.445
EXACTLY, BUT NOT TO WORRY.
YOURS IS LOOKING JUST FINE.

15:45.478 --> 15:48.281
I JUST WANT TO KEEP
A CLOSE EYE ON YOU, OKAY?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.417
WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE I JUST
WAS HOME, AND HERE I AM AGAIN.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.520
YOU KNOW, I SAY THAT
EVERY MORNING.
DR. BAILEY, O.R.'S READY.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.522
OKAY. UM, MRS. CORTEZ,

15:55.555 --> 15:58.291
YOUR TEMPERATURE
IS STILL A LITTLE HIGH.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.692
SO YOU JUST REST,

15:59.726 --> 16:02.295
AND WE'LL GET YOU HOME
IN NO TIME.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.597
OKAY.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.500
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT
SCRUBBING IN.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.203
I'M NOT.
NO, WATCH MRS. CORTEZ.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.439
IF THE FLUID IN HER DRAIN
CHANGES COLOR, YOU PAGE ME.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.575
IF HER FEVER GOES UP ONE DIGIT,
YOU PAGE ME.

16:15.608 --> 16:18.711
'CAUSE THE FEVER COULD BE--
AN ABSCESS, EARLY SEPSIS,
PNEUMONIA--

16:18.745 --> 16:20.313
ANY NUMBER OF NASTY THINGS.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.315
AND REMEMBER YOUR FIRST RULE
OF RESIDENCY--

16:22.349 --> 16:24.184
EAT WHEN YOU CAN,
SLEEP WHEN YOU CAN...

16:24.217 --> 16:26.653
(both) AND DON'T SCREW
WITH THE PANCREAS.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.490
(sighs) SO MUCH
FOR MY EASY DAY.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.226
NICE ANASTOMOSES.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.228
NO LEAKS.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.230
HOW ARE WE DOING?
WE GOOD?

16:37.264 --> 16:38.465
IT'S NOT...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.700
NO, IT'S NOT QUITE FITTING,
IS IT? THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM

16:40.733 --> 16:44.237
IN THE PERITONEAL CAVITY
FOR THE GRAFT.
THE LIVER'S TOO BIG?

16:44.271 --> 16:46.773
UH, THE BABY IS TOO SMALL.
(laughs)

16:46.806 --> 16:48.675
(monitor beeping erratically)
B.P. 64 OVER 40.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.444
IT'S COMPRESSING
THE HEPATIC VESSEL. SPONGE.

16:51.478 --> 16:54.681
NO, NO, NO. LARGER, LARGER,
LARGER. THERE WE GO.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.550
LET'S GET THIS SPONGE
TUCKED UP UNDER THERE,

16:57.584 --> 16:59.419
TAKE THE PRESSURE
OFF THE VESSELS,

16:59.452 --> 17:02.289
AND... YEAH, THAT'S DOING
THE TRICK THERE.
(beeping normalizes)

17:02.322 --> 17:04.691
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK WE'RE DONE.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.760
BUT THE LIVER'S NOT GONNA FIT.
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO CLOSE HER UP TODAY.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.762
JUST WRAP HER.

17:09.796 --> 17:12.232
THIS HAPPENS
WITH ADULT SPLIT LIVERS.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.633
YOU JUST GOTTA SIT TIGHT

17:13.666 --> 17:15.635
AND HOPE THAT THE SWELLING
GOES DOWN ENOUGH

17:15.668 --> 17:18.305
SO YOU CAN CLOSE HER UP.
WELL, HOW LONG
WILL THAT TAKE?

17:18.338 --> 17:20.307
AS LONG AS IT TAKES,
KAREV.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.309
THANK YOU ALL. GREAT WORK.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.711
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

17:24.744 --> 17:26.513
(sighs) THIS GRAFT IS BIG.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.781
THE SWELLING--IT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT TO GO DOWN.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.518
HOW LONG CAN IT STAY LIKE THAT,
WITH THAT SPONGE IN HER?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.787
I DON'T KNOW.
ISN'T IT JUST GONNA START
TO DETERIORATE?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
I MEAN,
SHE COULD GET INFECTED.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.625
AND--AND WHAT IF THE SWELLING
DOESN'T GO DOWN ENOUGH?

17:38.658 --> 17:41.494
THE LIVER WILL DIE, AND SHE'LL
BE BACK ON THE DONORS' LIST.

17:41.528 --> 17:44.497
OH, JEEZ.
HOW IS THIS A SOLUTION?
IT'S NOT.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.399
(beeping continues)

17:54.341 --> 17:56.376
(Muzak playing)

17:56.409 --> 17:59.379
UM, HOW CAN YOU NOT TALK
TO MEREDITH ABOUT THIS?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.448
SHE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.
OOH, I LOVE THAT LAMP.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.483
YOU CAN'T JUST CUT YOURSELF
OFF FROM A PERSON,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.452
PRETEND YOUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP
NEVER HAPPENED.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.354
I MEAN, YOU CAN,

18:07.387 --> 18:10.357
BUT IT MAKES YOU A HEARTLESS,
SOULLESS MONSTER

18:10.390 --> 18:12.859
WHO I THOUGHT I KNEW,
BUT REALLY DIDN'T.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.363
WITH WHEELS ON HER SHOES.
UGH. GOD, HOW WAS I OKAY
WITH THAT?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.331
I USED TO BE
A LOT COOLER THAN THAT.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.333
I WAS A LOT COOLER
WHEN I WAS SINGLE.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.601
YOU WERE HARDLY EVER SINGLE.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.703
(laughing) I KNOW.
I KNOW.

18:23.736 --> 18:27.507
OH, I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED
TO SPEND TIME ON MY OWN.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.841
(sighs)

18:28.875 --> 18:31.444
OKAY, I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO A HAIR SALON.

18:31.478 --> 18:34.614
NEXT. WE'RE DOING ME NOW.
CAN I HELP YOU
FIND SOMETHING?

18:34.647 --> 18:37.517
YES, I WILL TAKE THAT.
THAT SOFA?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.487
THAT ROOM.
ALL OF IT. I'LL TAKE IT.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.623
UH, YOU DO
SAME-DAY DELIVERY, RIGHT?

18:43.656 --> 18:45.625
GREAT.
(unzips purse)

18:45.658 --> 18:47.360
SO IT WENT VERY WELL.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.362
THE BABY LOOKS GOOD,
LIVER LOOKS GOOD,

18:49.396 --> 18:51.264
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL
EXHALE A LITTLE BIT NOW.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.765
WHEN CAN WE SEE HER?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.368
SOON. WE'D LIKE
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.570
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF
SWELLING, AND I WANT TO SEE

18:57.604 --> 18:59.639
THAT GO DOWN, BUT, UH,
YEAH, WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.707
THANK YOU.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.510
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. STARK.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.412
JUST... THANK YOU.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.447
YEAH,
MY PLEASURE ENTIRELY.

19:08.881 --> 19:11.284
YOU AREN'T GONNA TELL THEM
ANY MORE THAN THAT?

19:11.318 --> 19:13.553
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT ME
TO TELL THEM, KAREV?
WELL, THAT THERE'S
A CHANCE OF INFECTION,

19:13.586 --> 19:15.555
THAT IF THE LIVER
DOESN'T ACTUALLY CONFORM...
(pager beeps)

19:15.588 --> 19:17.424
THEY COULD BE BACK
ON THE DONORS' LIST.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.559
I MEAN, THEY'RE SMART PEOPLE.

19:19.592 --> 19:22.695
THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHAT COULD GO WRONG.
AND MAKE THEM MORE WORRIED
THAN THEY ALREADY ARE?

19:22.729 --> 19:25.732
I THINK
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ENOUGH.
TELL ME A BETTER SOLUTION.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.700
I, UH--

19:27.734 --> 19:31.338
CAN YOU GIVE ME
A BETTER SOLUTION?

19:31.371 --> 19:32.839
NO.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.442
WELL, THEN
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT

19:35.475 --> 19:37.477
AND GO DO SOMETHING
YOU CAN DO.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.879
YOU CAN START
WITH MY POST-OPS.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.681
(K'naan) * YEAH
BELIEVE IT OR NOT... *

19:41.714 --> 19:44.351
YOU TRIED.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.819
* WHAT KEPT ME ALIVE
IS MY DREAM *

19:46.853 --> 19:48.288
OW!

19:48.321 --> 19:50.290
OKAY, SINCE WHEN IS IT OKAY

19:50.323 --> 19:52.292
TO SHOOT PEOPLE
IN THIS HOSPITAL?

19:52.325 --> 19:54.361
NOW BAILEY'S
GIVEN UP ON ME, TOO.

19:54.394 --> 19:57.430
YOU'RE ON HER SERVICE.
WHY ARE YOU STILL FREAKING OUT?

19:57.464 --> 19:58.698
NO. BAILEY'S IN SURGERY.
SHE TRUSTS ME

19:58.731 --> 20:01.634
TO WATCH HER POST-OP DRIP FLUID
INTO A BAG EVERY TEN MINUTES.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.304
OW!
OKAY, INAPPROPRIATE.

20:04.337 --> 20:07.507
OKAY, YOU SHOULD RELAX. YOU GET
AN EASY DAY, YOU TAKE IT.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.442
SHEPHERD DIDN'T NEED ME,

20:09.476 --> 20:11.411
SO I TOOK A NAP
IN THE RESEARCH LIBRARY.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.480
GIVE ME--GIVE IT TO ME.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.615
JERKFACE.
(ping-pong ball clatters
on floor)

20:15.648 --> 20:18.585
HE'S HAVING A ROUGH DAY.
NEW ROBBINS IS NO ROBBINS.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.720
CHECK THIS OUT--ARMED ESCORT
TO GET A YOGURT.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.823
OKAY, WHO IS IT?
IS IT BONO?
IT'S TOTALLY BONO.
IT'S ALL OVER THE HOSPITAL.

20:23.856 --> 20:27.727
IT'S NOT BONO.
ARE YOU GOING
TO CRISTINA'S TONIGHT?

20:27.760 --> 20:30.430
I DON'T KNOW.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.832
(clatters)
OKAY...

20:32.865 --> 20:35.335
NOT OKAY.
(laughs) OKAY,
THAT'S ADDICTING.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.571
PUT IT AWAY BEFORE MY GUY
WRESTLES YOU TO THE GROUND.
GIMMIE THAT.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.740
NO.
GIMMIE THE BALL.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.476
NO. G--

20:43.510 --> 20:44.911
* BUT I AIN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO GOT PROBLEMS *

20:44.944 --> 20:47.414
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?
HE'S HAVING A ROUGH DAY.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.881
AHEM.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.385
JEEZ, I'M COMING.

20:52.419 --> 20:53.620
* BUT STILL

20:53.653 --> 20:55.622
(ball clatters)

20:55.655 --> 20:58.358
* I STILL KNOW HOW TO GET DOWN

20:58.391 --> 21:02.495
* I STILL KNOW HOW TO VIBE OUT,
YEAH *

21:02.529 --> 21:04.564
I'LL CHECK IN.
THE EMIR'S CATH CONFIRMED

21:04.597 --> 21:07.567
THAT HE DOES HAVE A TEAR
IN ONE OF HIS CORONARY ARTERIES.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.437
WE'VE STABILIZED HIM
WITH A BALLOON PUMP, BUT I AM

21:10.470 --> 21:13.406
GONNA HAVE TO PERFORM OPEN-HEART
SURGERY TO REPAIR THE TEAR.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.442
(men speaking indistinctly)
(man) DOCTOR! DOCTOR!

21:15.475 --> 21:17.744
DOCTOR! DOCTOR, PLEASE
WAS THE TEAR IN HIS--

21:17.777 --> 21:20.413
QUIET, PLEASE.
PLEASE. WAS THE TEAR
IN HIS ARTERY

21:20.447 --> 21:22.415
AN INJURY SUSTAINED
IN THE CAR ACCIDENT?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.951
THERE IS NO WAY OF--
DOCTOR, DON'T ANSWER THAT.

21:24.984 --> 21:28.321
THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING
IF THAT WAS THE CAUSE.

21:28.355 --> 21:29.956
(man speaks foreign language)

21:29.989 --> 21:31.958
CAN WE HAVE ASSURANCES
THAT YOUR FINEST SURGEONS

21:31.991 --> 21:34.494
WILL BE OPERATING ON
HIS HIGHNESS?
(Richard) YES.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.629
UH, THESE ARE THE CHIEFS
OF MY CARDIOTHORACIC

21:36.663 --> 21:38.631
AND TRAUMA DEPARTMENTS.
(man speaks
foreign language)

21:38.665 --> 21:42.001
(man speaks foreign language)

21:42.034 --> 21:44.003
SORRY. HE WAS ASKING
YOUR STATE DEPARTMENT.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.606
HE DIDN'T MEAN THE FINEST
SURGEONS IN THIS HOSPITAL.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.941
WHICH IS WHY
YOU MIGHT BE MORE COMFORTABLE

21:48.975 --> 21:51.478
TRAVELING TO YOUR OWN COUNTRY,
WHERE HE CAN--

21:51.511 --> 21:54.681
(men shouting
in foreign language)

21:54.714 --> 21:57.384
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
QUIET. QUIET, PLEASE.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.619
QUIET, PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.954
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE
A LOT OF CONCERNS

22:01.988 --> 22:03.556
AND AGENDAS HERE.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.359
BUT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME GOAL,

22:06.393 --> 22:08.361
AND THAT IS
TO SEE THIS MAN LIVE.

22:08.395 --> 22:11.498
NOW WE ARE OUT OF TIME, WHICH
MEANS WE ARE OUT OF OPTIONS.

22:11.531 --> 22:14.667
I AM YOUR ONLY SHOT,
AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE ME.

22:14.701 --> 22:17.570
I CAN ONLY SAY
THAT IF YOU KNEW ME BETTER...
(speaking foreign language)

22:17.604 --> 22:19.972
YOU'D FEEL PRETTY GOOD
ABOUT YOUR CHANCES. (sighs)

22:20.006 --> 22:21.974
DR. HUNT AND I
ARE GOING TO OPERATE,

22:22.008 --> 22:24.944
AND WE WILL UPDATE YOU
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.980
(men speaking indistinctly)

22:28.014 --> 22:30.450
GOOD LUCK.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.552
(taps files on desk)

22:32.585 --> 22:35.955
(men continue speaking
indistinctly)

22:35.988 --> 22:38.958
(lowered voice)
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM TO STOP.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.693
TELL THEM THEY CAN'T OPERATE.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.695
W-WHY? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

22:42.729 --> 22:45.598
(whispers indistinctly)

22:45.632 --> 22:48.468
COME WITH ME.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.470
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.
HE MADE ME SWEAR.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.472
JUST TELL HIM
WHAT YOU TOLD US.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.474
FOUR MONTHS AGO,
THE EMIR WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

22:54.507 --> 22:56.809
AN UNRUPTURED CEREBRAL ANEURYSM
IN HIS LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.412
(Derek) HE'S IN C.T. NOW?
WELL, HIS FIRST NEURO
CAME UP CLEAR,

22:59.446 --> 23:01.948
BUT NOW HE'S GOT
A BLOWN PUPIL.
SO WE THINK IT'S BURST.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.517
THE SCAN
SHOULD BE UP BY NOW.
I SWORE TO HIM,

23:04.551 --> 23:06.519
I WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TILL AFTER THE ELECTION.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.521
I'M STILL NOT SURE
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.658
I MIGHT
BE COSTING HIM EVERYTHING.
YOU'RE TRYING
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

23:11.691 --> 23:13.660
HE'S TRYING TO SAVE
SEVEN MILLION LIVES,

23:13.693 --> 23:16.463
TO MAKE IT SO SEVEN MILLION
PEOPLE CAN WALK THE STREET

23:16.496 --> 23:18.865
WITHOUT THE FEAR OF BEING
MURDERED BY THE EXTREMISTS.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.967
HE DOESN'T, UM...
HE RISKS HIS LIFE

23:21.000 --> 23:23.670
EVERY TIME
HE STEPS OUT HIS DOOR.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.672
YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT HIM, TOO,

23:25.705 --> 23:28.475
AND I'M SURE
HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.712
HE WAS HEADED TO SURGERY?

23:32.745 --> 23:35.214
YEAH, WE'RE GOING IN ON
A DISSECTED CORONARY ARTERY.

23:35.247 --> 23:38.551
(beeping)
OH, YEAH,
THAT ANEURYSM'S BLOWN.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.687
DAMN IT.
THAT'S A HUGE BLEED.
WELL, I'M NOT SURPRISED.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.222
HE WAS SHOCKED SEVEN TIMES
AND GIVEN BLOOD THINNER,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.225
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE.
HE PRESENTED LIKE AN M.I.
I TREATED HIM APPROPRIATELY.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.728
I COULDN'T
HAVE SEEN THIS COMING.
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN
SAYING THAT A LOT TODAY.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.498
YOU KNOW WHAT, SHEPHERD?
I DON'T NEED CRAP FROM YOU.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.501
APPARENTLY I HOLD THE WHOLE FATE
OF THE MIDDLE EAST IN MY HANDS.
APPARENTLY, NOW I DO, TOO.

23:54.534 --> 23:58.471
BOOK AN O.R. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK SIMULTANEOUSLY.
OH, CAN'T WAIT.

23:58.505 --> 24:01.040
(beeps)

24:12.519 --> 24:14.754
CRISTINA'S HAVING A PARTY?
CRISTINA YANG?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.490
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT... (sighs) I'M GONNA GO.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.559
WE'RE ALL GONNA GO
AND TALK TO HER.

24:19.592 --> 24:20.960
AND YOU SHOULD COME, TOO.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.563
I MEAN, YOU QUIT ONCE.
YOU WALKED AWAY AND CAME BACK.

24:23.596 --> 24:26.933
SO MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY THAT COULD HELP.
NO.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.935
NO?
DO YOU REMEMBER

24:28.968 --> 24:31.203
WHEN YOU CAME OUT TO TALK
TO ME ABOUT COMING BACK?

24:31.237 --> 24:32.805
DO YOU REMEMBER

24:32.839 --> 24:36.543
WHEN I HIT YOUR ENGAGEMENT RING
WITH A BASEBALL BAT?
OH, THAT WAS A GREAT DAY.

24:36.576 --> 24:37.877
SHE'S ALREADY LASHING OUT.

24:37.910 --> 24:39.879
DON'T GO
AND TRY TO CONFRONT HER.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.948
NO INTERVENTION
ON CRISTINA YANG.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.684
DO YOU HEAR ME?
IT'S A BAD IDEA.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.853
(door opens)

24:48.287 --> 24:49.989
WHAT ARE YOU STERILIZING?

24:50.022 --> 24:51.591
(air hisses)

24:51.624 --> 24:54.060
(crinkles)

24:54.093 --> 24:56.529
YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

24:56.563 --> 24:58.798
WHAT WAS SO IMPORTANT?

24:58.831 --> 25:02.001
UH...

25:02.034 --> 25:04.604
SIR, I WAS
OUT OF LINE EARLIER,

25:04.637 --> 25:06.873
BUT, UH, I THINK
I FOUND A SOLUTION

25:06.906 --> 25:08.675
FOR LISA COLLIS' LIVER.

25:08.708 --> 25:10.743
WHAT IS THAT,
A PING-PONG BALL?

25:10.777 --> 25:12.745
IT'S THE PERFECT SHAPE
TO KEEP THE LIVER

25:12.779 --> 25:15.014
FROM COMPRESSING
HER BLOOD VESSELS.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.283
IT'S MADE OF CELLULOID
NOT PLASTIC,

25:17.316 --> 25:19.285
SO IT WON'T BREAK DOWN
LIKE A SPONGE WILL.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.721
IT'S GAS STERILIZED, SO THERE'S
LITTLE RISK OF INFECTION.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.723
I MEAN, YOU COULD
LEAVE IT IN THERE FOREVER.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.725
HER LIVER
WILL JUST GROW AROUND IT.

25:25.758 --> 25:28.561
I MEAN, I THINK IT'S A...

25:28.595 --> 25:30.262
YOU THINK IT WON'T WORK.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.197
NO.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.601
I WAS THINKING, I LEFT YOU
TO DO MY POST-OPS,

25:34.634 --> 25:38.237
AND HERE I FIND YOU
PLAYING WITH BALLS.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.706
I DON'T KNOW, KAREV.

25:39.739 --> 25:43.075
AM I GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO YOUR CHIEF ABOUT YOU?

25:43.109 --> 25:46.012
YEAH, RIGHT.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.248
(clatters)

25:49.281 --> 25:50.216
(Muzak playing)

25:50.249 --> 25:52.985
MM, I WANT IT SORT OF,
LIKE, BADASS, YOU KNOW?

25:53.019 --> 25:54.987
A LITTLE DANGEROUS,
A LITTLE UNPREDICTABLE.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.989
DID YOU BRING A PICTURE?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.991
MM.
IT'S MORE OF A FEELING.

25:59.025 --> 26:02.328
WHAT DO THEY DO ALL DAY--
THE MALL PEOPLE?

26:02.361 --> 26:05.031
LOOK AT THEM.
THEY MOVE SO SLOWLY.

26:05.064 --> 26:07.634
THEY ALL MOSEY. LOOK.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.602
YEAH, I, UH,
CAN'T TURN MY HEAD.

26:09.636 --> 26:11.938
DO THEY JUST EAT THINGS
AND... BUY THINGS

26:11.971 --> 26:13.940
AND COMPLAIN ABOUT
THEIR BREAKUPS?

26:13.973 --> 26:15.908
YES.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.277
FANTASTIC.
LOOK AT THAT LADY.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.279
SHE'S JUST GONNA EAT
THAT PRETZEL.

26:20.312 --> 26:22.882
THAT'S ALL SHE'S GONNA DO.
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

26:22.915 --> 26:25.818
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BECOME
A MALL PERSON, SHOP AND EAT?
THIS YOGURT'S PRETTY GOOD.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.320
I'M SERIOUS.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.823
***

26:30.857 --> 26:33.793
I'M GETTING A PRETZEL.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.962
(speaks indistinctly)

26:35.995 --> 26:37.363
AVERY, HOW'S OUR PATIENT?

26:37.396 --> 26:38.965
OH, NO CHANGE.

26:38.998 --> 26:41.400
OH, THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
I'M GOING INTO MY CHOLE.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.103
SO YOU--YOU STILL DON'T
WANT ME TO SCRUB IN OR--
NO. I NEED YOU TO WATCH--

26:44.136 --> 26:45.938
MRS. CORTEZ.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.374
RIGHT. WELL, LIKE I SAID,
NO CHANGE.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.710
AVERY, I NEED YOU
WHERE I NEED YOU.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.344
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.346
NO, MA'AM. THAT'S FINE.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.547
I GET IT.

26:55.581 --> 26:58.751
I'M SAYING, WITH THIS LETTER,
THERE'S A TIME FRAME NOW.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.853
YOU'RE CONTENT TO STAND BACK

27:00.887 --> 27:03.389
AND WATCH CRISTINA
LOSE HER SPOT IN THIS PROGRAM?

27:03.422 --> 27:05.391
I'M SAYING AN INTERVENTION
IS NOT A GOOD PLAN.

27:05.424 --> 27:08.327
SUCTION.
(Teddy) IT'S NOT
AN INTERVENTION, SHEPHERD.

27:08.360 --> 27:11.397
WE JUST THOUGHT,
SINCE WE WERE ALL TOGETHER--
TORSADES!

27:11.430 --> 27:13.132
(monitor beeping erratically)
DAMN IT. HE'S IN V-FIB.
ALL RIGHT, SHEPHERD.

27:13.165 --> 27:16.135
I NEED YOU TO STOP.
WE HAVE TO SHOCK HIM.
NO, WAIT. I'M RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF--

27:16.168 --> 27:17.870
INTERNAL PADDLES.
ALL RIGHT, CHARGE TO 10.

27:17.904 --> 27:19.438
HOLD ON. HOLD ON!

27:19.471 --> 27:22.875
(beeping continues)

27:22.909 --> 27:25.011
SHEPHERD.

27:25.044 --> 27:28.380
(beeping continues)

27:28.414 --> 27:29.949
OKAY. CLEAR.
(defibrillator whines)

27:29.982 --> 27:31.450
(thunks)

27:31.483 --> 27:33.319
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:33.352 --> 27:35.054
SINUS TACH.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.923
(sighs)

27:36.956 --> 27:39.926
HEY, DID STARK EVER RESPOND
TO MY PAGE?

27:39.959 --> 27:41.460
HE'S GOT THREE DISCHARGES.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.130
ONE OF 'EM HAS BEEN HERE
SINCE YESTERDAY.
DR. STARK'S IN SURGERY.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.999
HE WENT BACK IN
ON LISA COLLIS.
WHAT?

27:47.033 --> 27:49.001
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:49.035 --> 27:51.470
(suction gurgling)

27:51.503 --> 27:53.339
(Richard) IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

27:53.372 --> 27:54.841
IT'S SO SIMPLE.

27:54.874 --> 27:56.475
WE'LL SEE IF IT WORKS.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.978
IT IS THE RIGHT SHAPE,
AND IT'S CELLULOID,

27:59.011 --> 28:00.747
SO IT WON'T BREAK DOWN.

28:00.780 --> 28:03.415
(Richard) AND THE LIVER
WILL CONFORM TO IT.

28:03.449 --> 28:05.117
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.119
WHOSE IDEA WAS IT,
DR. STARK, ORIGINALLY?

28:07.153 --> 28:10.122
WAS IT YOURS
OR DR. KAREV'S?

28:10.156 --> 28:13.726
LET'S JUST SEE
IF IT WORKS.

28:13.760 --> 28:17.396
(suction gurgling)

28:17.429 --> 28:21.367
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:23.803 --> 28:26.773
AND I'M BACK, MRS. CORTEZ.
DID YOU MISS ME?

28:26.806 --> 28:28.775
WOULD YOU PLEASE
LET THE DOG OUT?

28:28.808 --> 28:31.443
HE WON'T STOP BARKING.
SHE'S DELIRIOUS.

28:31.477 --> 28:33.445
PULSE IS THREADY.
I THINK SHE'S IN SHOCK.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.815
GET ME HER VITALS.
OH, NO, NO, NO. DAMN IT!

28:35.848 --> 28:38.951
ALL RIGHT. GET ME A MONITOR
IN HERE. CALL DR. BAILEY NOW!

28:38.985 --> 28:41.087
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.
COME ON.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.089
I'M ALMOST DONE HERE.
GET HER INTO AN O.R.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.457
OPEN HER UP AND WAIT FOR ME.
I'LL BE THERE.

28:45.491 --> 28:48.094
OPEN--DID YOU SAY
"OPEN HER UP"?

28:57.369 --> 29:00.472
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:00.506 --> 29:02.541
NO WORD FROM DR. BAILEY?

29:02.574 --> 29:05.912
(beeping continues)

29:05.945 --> 29:07.446
OKAY.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.148
10-BLADE.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.518
(Azure Ray) * YOUNG GIRL BY

29:12.551 --> 29:14.420
* YOUR SIDE

29:14.453 --> 29:16.989
THAT ARTERY IS AT THE BASE
OF THE HEART.

29:17.023 --> 29:20.126
BYPASS WOULD BE
SO MUCH BETTER.
NO, I CANNOT MANAGE
THIS BLEED ON BYPASS.

29:20.159 --> 29:21.727
OKAY. GOOD. THERE.
I CAN CLIP THE ANEURYSM.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.864
I NEED YOU STOP DOING
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
I AM TRYING TO DO
A CORONARY GRAFT

29:24.897 --> 29:27.399
ON A HEMORRHAGING HEART.
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO?

29:27.433 --> 29:31.037
DO IT FASTER.
ALL RIGHT. I NEED YOU
TO STOP MAKING THIS MY FAULT.

29:31.070 --> 29:34.440
ALL RIGHT. PACK THAT. I TRIED
EVERYTHING I COULD FOR YANG.

29:34.473 --> 29:37.944
I ENCOURAGED HER INTO THE O.R.
I KEPT HER OUT OF THE O.R.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.046
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
I COULD'VE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.481
ALL RIGHT. HOLD PRESSURE.
MORE.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.917
OKAY, GOOD. GO.

29:44.951 --> 29:46.452
YANG WAS MY STUDENT.

29:46.485 --> 29:48.120
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT I WANTED TO HELP HER?

29:48.154 --> 29:51.590
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING
THAT I FAILED.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.359
I'M SAYING
THAT WE ALL FAILED.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.129
SO NOW IT'S TIME
JUST TO BACK OFF.
NO, SHEPHERD, YOU NEED
TO BACK OFF. SHE'S MY WIFE.

29:57.163 --> 30:00.099
AND I'M NOT GONNA
GIVE UP ON HER YET.
ALL RIGHT.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.869
IT'S CLEAR WE ALL HAVE
THE SAME GOAL. WE WANT HER BACK.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.037
DONE. I GOT IT.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.974
* THAT WAY

30:08.007 --> 30:09.375
I'M SORRY.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.377
* THAT WAY

30:11.410 --> 30:14.513
I HAVE A PERSONAL STAKE
IN THIS, TOO.

30:14.546 --> 30:19.451
I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE
IF IT WASN'T FOR HER.

30:19.485 --> 30:21.420
RIGHT.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.455
* NOW IT'S...

30:23.489 --> 30:25.457
BUT YOU'RE ASKING US
TO DO NOTHING,

30:25.491 --> 30:26.893
AND WE CAN'T DO THAT.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.895
I CAN'T DO THAT.

30:28.928 --> 30:31.130
OKAY.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.399
LET'S START CLOSING.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.202
* STILL COME HERE

30:40.472 --> 30:43.042
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

30:43.075 --> 30:45.044
* SHOULDN'T HAVE LOVED

30:45.077 --> 30:46.445

30:46.478 --> 30:49.648

30:49.681 --> 30:51.984

30:52.018 --> 30:54.520
(sighs)
SON OF A BITCH!

30:54.553 --> 30:56.388
THIS IS NOT MY FAULT.

30:56.422 --> 30:58.624
SHE'S GOT A FISTULA.
THEY GET DELAYED HEMORRHAGE.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.526
POST-OP PANCREATECTOMIES
ALWAYS GET FISTULAS.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.528
I DIDN'T SCREW THIS UP.
AVERY, I--

31:02.561 --> 31:04.596
NO, YOU LISTEN.
THEY ALWAYS GET FISTULAS,

31:04.630 --> 31:06.565
THEN THEY GET
SEVERE COMPLICATIONS,

31:06.598 --> 31:08.434
THEN THEY DIE.
I DID WHAT YOU SAID.

31:08.467 --> 31:10.636
YOU TOLD ME TO OPEN HER UP,
AND THEN YOU WEREN'T HERE.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.504
I TRIED TO FIX IT.
AVERY--

31:12.538 --> 31:15.641
THIS IS NOT MY DAMN FAULT!
DR. AVERY!

31:15.674 --> 31:18.010
STEP OUT OF MY O.R.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.602
WE ARE AWESOME. I CAN'T
BELIEVE WE DID ALL THIS.

31:43.635 --> 31:46.605
UH, I-I DID ALL THIS.
YOU OPENED ONE BOTTLE OF WINE.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.175
COULD YOU FIND WHERE
THE NAPKINS ARE, PLEASE?
HELLO.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.443
OH, DAMN IT. UH, NOT READY.
HI.

31:51.477 --> 31:53.445
HEY, IF YOU'RE HERE
FOR THE PARTY,

31:53.479 --> 31:55.948
YOU'RE, LIKE, WAY TOO EARLY.
I'M NOT HERE FOR THE PARTY.

31:57.616 --> 32:00.586
ARE YOU HERE TO TELL ME
TO COME BACK?
NO.

32:00.619 --> 32:04.123
BUT A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE
ARE COMING TO DO THAT.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.492
OH, GOD.

32:08.094 --> 32:10.229
ARE YOU OKAY?

32:10.262 --> 32:12.264

32:12.298 --> 32:14.266
I-I TRIED TO FIND YOU.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.102
HE IS AWFUL.

32:16.135 --> 32:18.104
HE TRIED TO TAKE
ALL THE CREDIT.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.973
WELL... IS THE KID OKAY?
IS IT GONNA WORK?

32:21.007 --> 32:22.975
YEAH, YEAH. I MEAN,
O-OF COURSE IT'S GONNA WORK.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.576
IT'S BRILLIANT.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.979
I-I'M--I'M GONNA TALK
TO THE CHIEF...

32:27.013 --> 32:29.515
BECAUSE IT--
IT IS SO UNFAIR.

32:29.548 --> 32:32.584
YOU DID EVERY SINGLE THING
RIGHT TODAY.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.553
I MEAN, YOU COVERED
THAT ATTENDING'S ASS,

32:34.586 --> 32:37.990
AND YOU GOT--YOU GOT CRAPPED ON
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.559

SHOULD KNOW THAT.
OH, APRIL--

32:40.592 --> 32:43.162
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE SO...

32:43.195 --> 32:46.465
WHAT YOU DID TODAY
WAS SO GREAT.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.168
YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T
DESERVE THIS. I JUST--

32:49.201 --> 32:51.570
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT SOMEBODY KNOWS THAT,

32:51.603 --> 32:53.605
THAT I KNOW THAT.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.086
OH.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.487

33:14.526 --> 33:17.263
NO. NO, I DON'T WANT

WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME?

33:40.719 --> 33:43.689
YOU WANT TO SCREW? LET'S SCREW.
Y-YOU DON'T? THEN GET OUT.

I'M NOT GONNA
HOLD YOUR VIRGIN HAND

33:45.791 --> 33:48.827

37:13.665 --> 37:15.634
I MEAN, LIKE,
I MEAN, YOU GUYS DID WHAT,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.336
LIKE BAMBOO OR SOMETHING?

37:17.369 --> 37:19.338
WE'RE BUILDING OUR HOUSE
FROM SCRATCH.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.307
WE CAN PUT DOWN
WHATEVER WE WANT.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.742
YOU HAVE ORIGINAL OAK FLOORS.
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
I DON'T LIKE IT?

37:23.775 --> 37:25.944
I MEAN, WHAT IF--
WHAT IF I HATE OAK?

37:25.977 --> 37:27.946
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

37:27.979 --> 37:30.616
THE BUILDING'S HISTORIC.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.918
UGH. I KNOW.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.953
GOD. OKAY.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.623
OKAY, BUT I MEAN...

37:37.656 --> 37:39.625
(inhales deeply) OKAY.

37:39.658 --> 37:43.695
EVERY PRESSURIZED SYSTEM
NEEDS A RELIEF VALVE...

37:43.729 --> 37:46.698
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

37:46.732 --> 37:49.668
***

37:49.701 --> 37:52.304
(beeping continues)

37:52.338 --> 37:55.341
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY
TO REDUCE THE STRESS,

37:55.374 --> 37:58.410
THE TENSION...

37:58.444 --> 38:01.079
I GOT THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

38:01.112 --> 38:04.816
IT WAS A GRADE-C FISTULA
WITH A RUPTURED SPLENIC ARTERY.

38:04.850 --> 38:07.419
YOU DID EVERYTHING YOU COULD.
AVERY, TOO.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.421
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.323
YES, SIR.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.595
BAILEY, LOOK--

38:16.628 --> 38:18.597
WHY DO WE SEE
SO MANY POST-OP FISTULAS

38:18.630 --> 38:20.366
AFTER PANCREAS SURGERIES?

38:20.399 --> 38:23.602
I MEAN, YOUR OPERATION
IS FLAWLESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.871
WE STILL WE FISTULAS IN,
WHAT, 20% OF PATIENTS.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.607
I THINK... THERE'S A WAY
TO BRING THAT NUMBER DOWN.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.876
I JUST GOTTA FIND IT.
MIRANDA--

38:30.909 --> 38:32.744
I NEEDED A WIN, SIR.

38:32.778 --> 38:35.347
I-I'VE GOT A STRING
OF BIG LOSSES,

38:35.381 --> 38:37.649
AND... I COULD USE A WIN.

38:37.683 --> 38:40.386
THAT'S ALL.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.754
YANG... (chuckles)

38:42.788 --> 38:46.625
YANG WAS THE ONE
I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.027
I KNOW.

38:49.060 --> 38:50.629
***

38:50.662 --> 38:52.631
I KNOW.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.100
BEFORE IT BECOMES
TOO MUCH TO BEAR.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.669
LOOK INTO
THE PANCREATECTOMY PATIENTS.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.405
FIGURE IT OUT,

38:59.438 --> 39:01.440
AND THEN LET ME KNOW
HOW I CAN HELP.

39:01.473 --> 39:03.442
UH, CAN I USE AVERY?

39:03.475 --> 39:06.812
HE ACTUALLY GAVE ME THE IDEA.
HE WAS GREAT TODAY.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.414
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.416
YOU KNOW ALEX KAREV
SAVED A BABY'S LIFE

39:10.449 --> 39:12.951
WITH A PING-PONG BALL?
A PING-PONG BALL?

39:12.984 --> 39:14.720
YES, HE DID.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.954
(chuckles) ALEX KAREV.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.690
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY
TO FIND RELIEF...

39:18.724 --> 39:20.091
(indistinct conversations)

39:20.125 --> 39:24.696
BECAUSE IF THE PRESSURE
DOESN'T FIND A WAY OUT...

39:24.730 --> 39:26.632
IT'LL MAKE ONE.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.867
OH, LISTEN.
LET ME TALK TO HER.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.136
(guests murmuring)
ALL RIGHT.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.170
(grunts)

39:32.203 --> 39:34.039
(grunts)

39:34.072 --> 39:36.475
(murmuring continues)

39:36.508 --> 39:38.477
COME HERE. COME ON.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.145
HERE. COME ON.

39:40.178 --> 39:42.047
IT WILL EXPLODE.
OKAY, OKAY.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.816
OKAY, OKAY. LET'S GO.
LET'S GO. OUTSIDE.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.819
***

39:50.088 --> 39:53.024
IT'S THE PRESSURE
WE PUT ON OURSELVES

39:53.058 --> 39:55.026
THAT'S THE HARDEST TO BEAR...

39:55.060 --> 39:57.696
YOU THINK IT WAS HARD
FOR YANG...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.731
TO QUIT, TO...
TO JUST WALK AWAY?

39:59.765 --> 40:01.733
OH, DON'T BE STUPID.
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

40:01.767 --> 40:04.703
BESIDES, YOU MIGHT HAVE JUST
GOTTEN YOURSELF FIRED

40:04.736 --> 40:06.805
OR ARRESTED,
PROBABLY BOTH.

40:06.838 --> 40:07.839
YEAH, WELL,

40:07.873 --> 40:10.676
APRIL IS THE ONLY FRIEND
I HAVE LEFT HERE, SO...

40:10.709 --> 40:12.944
DON'T BE STUPID.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.946
***

40:14.980 --> 40:16.948
THE PRESSURE TO BE
BETTER THAN WE ARE...

40:16.982 --> 40:18.950
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.953
SHE'S A VIRGIN.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
I KNOW.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.722
GOD--OW! OW.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.957
I MEAN, IF YOU NEEDED IT
THAT BAD, ALEX,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.226
YOU SHOULD'VE
GONE BACK TO VEGAS.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.828
THERE'S
A WHOLE INDUSTRY THERE.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.130
I DIDN'T GO TO VEGAS.
I WENT TO IOWA.

40:32.163 --> 40:34.132
YOU WENT TO IOWA.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.502
I WENT HOME.

40:36.535 --> 40:38.804
MY BROTHER--REMEMBER AARON?

40:38.837 --> 40:40.138
YEAH.

40:40.171 --> 40:44.042
THE DOCTORS SAID...

40:44.075 --> 40:46.478
HE GOT DIAGNOSED
SCHIZOPHRENIC,

40:46.512 --> 40:49.214
JUST LIKE MY MOM.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.216
YOU KNOW
HOW THEY FIGURED IT OUT?

40:51.249 --> 40:53.819
HE TRIED TO KILL
OUR LITTLE SISTER.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.755
SHE'S 16, SHE'S A KID,

40:56.788 --> 40:59.057
AND HER BROTHER
TRIED TO KILL HER.

40:59.090 --> 41:01.793
AND MY MOM
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

41:01.827 --> 41:04.830
'CAUSE SHE'S OFF HER MEDS,
AND...

41:04.863 --> 41:06.832
ANYWAY, I WAS IN IOWA.

41:06.865 --> 41:08.233
THAT'S WHERE I WENT,

41:08.266 --> 41:10.235
TO MY BROTHER'S
COMMITMENT HEARING.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.237
I HAD TO COMMIT HIM.
WHATEVER.

41:12.270 --> 41:15.073
THE PRESSURE TO BE BETTER
THAN WE THINK WE CAN BE...

41:15.106 --> 41:17.809
WELL, IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU WERE THERE.

41:17.843 --> 41:21.547
I WASN'T THERE.
I WASN'T.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.148
***

41:23.181 --> 41:25.150
I SHOWED UP,

41:25.183 --> 41:27.152
I HELD MY SISTER'S HAND
IN THE HOSPITAL

41:27.185 --> 41:29.688
FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES,

41:29.721 --> 41:31.957
I SHOVED SOME PILLS
DOWN MY MOM'S THROAT,

41:31.990 --> 41:34.192
I SIGNED MY BROTHER
INTO A NUTHOUSE...

41:34.225 --> 41:37.729
AND I GOT THE HELL OUTTA THERE
AS FAST AS I COULD.

41:37.763 --> 41:39.130
I WASN'T THERE.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.133
I'M THE ASS
WHO CAN'T STAND TO BE THERE.

41:42.167 --> 41:44.135
IT NEVER...

41:44.169 --> 41:47.773
EVER LETS UP.

41:47.806 --> 41:50.909
I SHOULD GO DOWN THERE.

41:50.942 --> 41:53.912
UGH. I HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.914
YEAH.

41:55.947 --> 41:57.916
I SHOULD GO.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.019
(man and woman)
* SING ME TO SLEEP TONIGHT

42:01.052 --> 42:03.822
YOU GOOD?

42:03.855 --> 42:06.324
ANYTHING ELSE
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

42:06.357 --> 42:08.994
* IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

42:09.027 --> 42:11.863
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
FOR BATHROOM TILE?

42:11.897 --> 42:13.098
OH, BATHROOM TILE.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.867
UH, OOH. UH...
