WEBVTT

00:03.795 --> 00:06.422
I think he wants us
to pick up where he left off.

00:07.048 --> 00:09.466
Saving people, hunting things.
Family business.

00:11.261 --> 00:14.013
I don't understand the blind faith
you have in the man.

00:14.264 --> 00:16.265
It's called being a good son.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.811
You were just pissed off
you couldn't control me anymore!

00:29.279 --> 00:33.282
If only your boys knew
how much their daddy loved them.

00:41.666 --> 00:42.875
Dad?

00:48.173 --> 00:50.716
- Did he say anything to you?
- No.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.720
I'm dealing with Dad's death.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.973
Are you?

02:49.419 --> 02:53.505
Woo! Listen to her purr.
You ever heard anything so sweet?

02:53.673 --> 02:55.966
If you two wanna get a room,
just let me know.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.051
Oh, don't listen to him, baby.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.596
He doesn't understand us.

03:02.098 --> 03:04.641
- You're in a good mood.
- Why shouldn't I be?

03:05.476 --> 03:07.644
- No reason.
- I got my car.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.147
Got a case. Things are looking up.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.648
Wow.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.027
Give you a couple of severed heads
and a pile of dead cows...

03:15.195 --> 03:17.738
...and you're Mr. Sunshine.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.698
How far to Red Lodge?

03:19.866 --> 03:22.659
About another 300 miles.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.328
Good.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.544
The murder investigation is ongoing.
That's all I can share with the press.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.130
Sure, we understand that.
But just for the record.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.799
You found the first head last week...

03:37.967 --> 03:39.384
- ...correct?
- Uh-huh.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.137
Okay, and the other,
a Christina Flanagan.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.390
- That was two days ago. Then-
- Excuse me, sheriff.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.267
Oh, thank you.

03:47.435 --> 03:50.270
- Sorry, time's up. We're done here.
- One last question.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.022
- What about the cattle?
- Excuse me?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.523
The cows found dead...

03:53.691 --> 03:57.194
...split open, drained,
over a dozen cases?

03:57.403 --> 03:58.820
What about them?

03:59.030 --> 04:01.073
So you don't think there's a connection?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.951
Connection with...?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.954
First, cattle mutilations.

04:07.121 --> 04:09.998
Now, two murders.
Kind of sounds like ritual stuff.

04:10.166 --> 04:13.043
You know, like satanic-cult ritual stuff.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.591
You...

04:22.011 --> 04:24.680
- You're not kidding.
- No.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.393
Those cows aren't being mutilated.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.520
- You wanna know how I know?
- How?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.606
Because there's no such thing
as cattle mutilation.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.858
Cow drops, leave it in the sun...

04:37.026 --> 04:40.529
...within 48 hours
the bloat will split it open so clean...

04:40.697 --> 04:42.447
...it's just about surgical.

04:42.615 --> 04:46.285
The bodily fluids fall down
into the ground, get soaked up...

04:46.452 --> 04:48.787
...because that's what gravity does.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.124
But, hey, it could be Satan.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.460
What newspaper
did you say you work for?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.506
- World Weekly News.
- Weekly World News.

04:59.674 --> 05:00.924
- World-
- Weekly World.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.509
World- I'm new.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.264
Get out of my office.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.190
- John.
- Jeff.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.067
Jeff, I know that.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.278
Dr. Dworkin needs to see you
in his office.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.030
But Dr. Dworkin's on vacation.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.615
He's back and he's pissed.
He's screaming for you.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.743
- So if I were you, I would:
- Okay.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.411
Okay.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.667
Those Satanists in Florida,
they marked their victims?

05:35.835 --> 05:38.462
- Yeah. Reverse pentacle on the forehead.
- Yeah.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.423
So much F'd up crap happens in Florida.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.056
All right, open it.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.849
You open it.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.393
You wuss.

06:02.612 --> 06:03.820
Well, no pentagram.

06:03.988 --> 06:07.199
- Wow. Poor girl.
- Maybe we should look in her mouth.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.951
See if those wackos
stuffed anything down her throat.

06:10.119 --> 06:13.372
You know, kind of like the moth
in Silence of the Lambs.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.333
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
- No, you go ahead.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.419
- What?
- Put the lotion in the basket.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.130
Right, yeah, I'm the wuss, huh?

06:22.965 --> 06:24.758
Whatever.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.808
- Dean, get me a bucket.
Find something?

06:33.017 --> 06:34.434
No, I'm gonna puke.

06:38.272 --> 06:40.982
- Wait, lift her lip up again.
- What?

06:41.484 --> 06:44.528
- You want me to throw up.
- No, no, no. I think I saw something.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.700
What is that, a hole?

06:52.328 --> 06:54.454
It's a tooth.
- Sam, that's a fang.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.252
A retractable set of vampire fangs.
You gotta be kidding me.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.711
Well, this changes things.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.463
You think?

07:30.616 --> 07:33.076
- How's it going?
- Living the dream.

07:33.244 --> 07:36.037
- What can I get for you?
- Two beers, please.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.040
So we're looking for some people.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.544
Sure. It's hard to be lonely.

07:44.255 --> 07:48.508
Yeah, but that's not what I meant.

07:55.433 --> 07:58.810
Great, so these people, they would've
moved here about six months ago.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.522
- Probably pretty rowdy, like to drink.
- Yeah, real night owls, you know?

08:02.690 --> 08:04.274
Sleep all day, party all night.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.861
Barker Farm got leased out
a couple months ago. Real winners.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.740
They've been in here a lot.
Drinkers. Noisy.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.034
I've had to eighty-six them
once or twice.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.830
Thanks.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.698
- Smile.
- What?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.284
- Show us those pearly whites.
- For the love of-

09:37.451 --> 09:40.870
You wanna stick that thing
someplace else? I'm not a vampire.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.582
Yeah, that's right. I heard you guys.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.334
- What do you know about vampires?
- How to kill them.

09:46.502 --> 09:49.546
Now, seriously, bro,
that knife's making me itch.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.384
- Hey.
- Whoa, easy there, Chachi.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.520
See? Fangless. Happy?

10:09.233 --> 10:12.110
Now, who the hell are you?

10:12.862 --> 10:15.030
Sam and Dean Winchester.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.950
I can't believe it.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.870
I met your old man once.
Hell of a guy. Great hunter.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.957
I heard he passed. I'm sorry.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.417
That's big shoes.

10:27.585 --> 10:31.630
But from what I hear, you guys fill them.
Great trackers. Good in a tight spot.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.591
- Seem to know a lot about our family.
- Word travels fast.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.427
- You know how hunters talk.
- No, we don't, actually.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.096
I guess there's a lot
your dad never told you, huh?

10:41.599 --> 10:42.932
So, um...

10:44.435 --> 10:46.311
So those two vampires,
they were yours.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.355
Yep. Been here two weeks.

10:48.522 --> 10:51.858
- Did you check out that farm?
- Just a bunch of hippie freaks.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.902
They could kill you
with that patchouli smell.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.737
Where's the nest, then?

10:57.531 --> 10:59.449
I got this one covered.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.285
Don't get me wrong,
it's a real pleasure meeting you.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.788
But I've been on this thing
for over a year.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.999
I killed a fang back in Austin,
tracked the nest here.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.501
I'll finish it.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.961
- We could help.
- Thanks.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.798
But I'm a go-it-alone type of guy.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.925
Come on, I've been itching for a hunt.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.512
Sorry. But, hey, I hear there's
a chupacabra two states over.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.347
Go ahead and knock yourselves out.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.689
It was real good meeting you, though.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.732
I'll buy you a drink on the flip side.

14:12.560 --> 14:16.771
So I guess I gotta buy you that drink.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.333
Here you go.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.627
No, no, I got it.
Come on.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.754
I insist.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.883
- Thank you, sweetie.
You're welcome. Thanks.

14:46.468 --> 14:49.429
- Another one bites the dust.
- That's right.

14:55.895 --> 14:56.978
Dean.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.816
You gave that big-ass fang
one hell of a haircut, my friend.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.944
Thank you.
- That was beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.114
- Well... You all right, Sammy?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

15:08.282 --> 15:12.076
- Well, lighten up a little, Sammy.
- He's the one who gets to call me that.

15:12.244 --> 15:16.122
Okay. No offense meant.
Just celebrating a little. Job well done.

15:16.290 --> 15:21.669
Right, well, decapitations
aren't my idea of a good time, I guess.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.172
Oh, come on, man.
It's not like it was human.

15:24.340 --> 15:28.134
- You gotta have fun with your job.
- That's what I've been trying to tell him.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.637
You could learn a thing or two
from this guy.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.017
Yeah, I bet I could.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.269
Look, I'm not gonna
bring you guys down.

15:38.437 --> 15:40.188
I'm just gonna go back to the motel.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.606
- Are you sure?
Yeah.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.402
Sammy.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.407
Remind me to beat that buzz kill
out of you later, all right?

15:54.703 --> 15:57.997
- Something I said?
- No, he just gets that way sometimes.

15:58.916 --> 15:59.958
Tell you what...

16:00.834 --> 16:03.419
...match of Quarters for the next round.

16:20.437 --> 16:24.691
So I pick up this crossbow,
and I hit that ugly sucker...

16:24.858 --> 16:27.443
...with a silver-tipped arrow
right in his heart.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.654
Sammy's waiting in the car...

16:29.822 --> 16:32.532
...and me and my dad
take the thing into the woods...

16:32.700 --> 16:33.950
...and burn it to a crisp.

16:34.743 --> 16:38.746
I'm sitting there, and I'm looking
into the fire. I'm thinking to myself:

16:39.164 --> 16:41.332
"I'm 16 years old.

16:41.750 --> 16:45.878
Kids my age are worried about pimples,
prom dates.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.756
I'm seeing things
that they'll never even know.

16:48.924 --> 16:51.217
Never even dream of."

16:53.262 --> 16:56.597
- So right then, I just sort of-
- Embraced the life?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.059
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.229
Yeah.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.064
How'd you get started?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.983
First time I saw a vampire,
I was barely 18.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.944
Home alone with my sister.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.906
I hear the window break in her room.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.117
I grab my dad's gun, run in.
Try to get it off her.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.618
It was too late.

17:19.121 --> 17:20.579
So I shoot the damn thing...

17:20.748 --> 17:23.875
...which is about as useful
as snapping it with a rubber band.

17:24.626 --> 17:28.046
It rushes me, picks me up,
flings me across the room...

17:28.213 --> 17:29.881
...knocks me out cold.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.090
When I wake up...

17:32.009 --> 17:34.260
...the vampire's gone...

17:34.428 --> 17:36.095
...my sister is gone.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.638
And then?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.807
Then...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.728
Try explaining that one
to your family.

17:45.314 --> 17:47.398
So I left home.

17:48.025 --> 17:51.069
And then bummed around,
looking for information.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.072
How you track them,
how you kill them.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.575
And I found that fang.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.453
It was my first kill.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.331
Sorry about your sister.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.333
Yeah.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.752
She was beautiful.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.672
I can still see her, you know?
The way she was.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.180
But, hey, that was a long time ago.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.266
I mean, your dad.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.935
It's gotta be rough.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.603
Yeah.

18:26.814 --> 18:30.608
Yeah, you know,
he was just one of those guys.

18:31.026 --> 18:33.027
Took some terrible beatings...

18:33.195 --> 18:35.196
...and just kept coming.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.824
So you're always saying to yourself,
you know:

18:38.158 --> 18:41.035
"He's indestructible.
He'll always be around.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.371
Nothing can kill my dad."

18:44.456 --> 18:46.582
And just like that...

18:48.043 --> 18:49.377
...he's gone.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.137
I can't talk about this to Sammy.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.056
You know, I gotta keep
my game face on.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.308
But, uh...

19:05.227 --> 19:08.229
But the truth is,
I'm not handling it very well.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.735
- Feel like I have this-
- Hole inside you?

19:15.404 --> 19:18.239
And it just gets bigger and bigger
and darker and darker?

19:21.201 --> 19:23.578
Good. You can use it.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.538
Keeps you hungry.

19:25.706 --> 19:29.500
Trust me, there's plenty out there
needs killing and this'll help you do it.

19:29.668 --> 19:33.671
Dean, it's not a crime to need your job.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.932
- Harvelle's Roadhouse.
- Hey, Ellen, Sam Winchester.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.351
Sam, it's good to hear from you.

19:47.519 --> 19:50.688
- You boys are okay, aren't you?
- Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.773
- Got a question.
- Yeah, shoot.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.193
You ever run across a guy
named Gordon Walker?

19:55.360 --> 19:57.028
- Yeah, I know Gordon.
- And?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.197
He's a real good hunter.
Why you asking, sweetie?

19:59.364 --> 20:02.366
We ran into him on a job
and we're kind of working with him.

20:02.534 --> 20:03.576
Don't do that, Sam.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.788
I- I thought you said
he was a good hunter.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.957
And Hannibal Lecter's
a good psychiatrist.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.044
Look, he is dangerous to everyone
and everything around him.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.755
If he's working on a job,
let him handle it, and move on.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.215
- Ellen-
- No, Sam.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.301
You just listen to what I'm telling you,
okay?

20:21.762 --> 20:22.803
Right, okay.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.890
- Know why I love this life?
- Hm?

20:26.308 --> 20:29.727
It's all black and white.
There's no maybe.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.979
You find the bad thing, kill it.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.317
See, most people spend their lives
in shades of gray.

20:36.485 --> 20:40.071
Is this right, is that wrong? Not us.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.657
I'm not sure Sammy would agree
with you, but...

20:42.824 --> 20:45.701
Doesn't seem like your brother's
much like us.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.288
I'm not saying he's wrong,
just different.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.083
You and me, we were born to do this.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.126
It's in our blood.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.163
Wait.

22:54.331 --> 22:55.998
Step back, Eli.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.384
My name's Lenore. I'm not gonna
hurt you. We just need to talk.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.969
Talk? Yeah, okay.
But I might have a tough time...

23:09.179 --> 23:11.472
...paying attention
to much besides Eli's teeth.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.557
He won't hurt you.
You have my word.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.559
Your word? Oh, yeah, great. Thanks.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.312
No offense, but you're not
the first vampire I've met.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.815
We're not like the others.
We don't kill humans.

23:20.982 --> 23:23.651
We don't drink their blood.
We haven't for a long time.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.904
- What is this, some kind of joke?
- Notice you're still alive.

23:30.450 --> 23:34.120
Okay, correct me if I'm wrong here,
but shouldn't you be starving to death?

23:34.287 --> 23:36.831
We've found other ways: cattle blood.

23:36.998 --> 23:41.502
- You're responsible for all the-?
- It's not ideal. In fact, it's disgusting.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.254
But allows us to get by.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.757
- Okay, why?
- Survival.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.926
No deaths, no missing locals...

23:49.094 --> 23:52.972
...no reason for people like you
to come looking for people like us.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.515
We blend in.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.435
Our kind is practically extinct.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.521
Turns out we weren't as high up
the food chain as we imagined.

24:00.730 --> 24:02.982
Why are we explaining ourselves
to this killer?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.942
- Eli.
- We choke on cows' blood...

24:05.110 --> 24:06.777
...so that none of them suffer.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.280
Tonight, they murdered Conrad
and celebrated.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.199
- Eli, that's enough.
- Yeah, Eli, that's enough.

24:12.367 --> 24:15.035
What's done is done.

24:15.245 --> 24:17.788
- We're leaving this town.
- Why did you bring me here?

24:17.956 --> 24:21.208
- Why are you even talking to me?
- Believe me, I'd rather not.

24:21.376 --> 24:24.712
I know your kind. Once you have
the scent, you'll keep tracking us.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.673
It doesn't matter where we go.
Hunters will find us.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.551
- You're asking us not to follow?
- We have a right to live.

24:30.760 --> 24:33.220
- We're not hurting anyone.
- Right, so you keep saying.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.348
But give me one good reason
why I should believe you.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.728
Fine.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.063
You know what I'm going to do?

24:46.359 --> 24:48.235
I'm going to let you go.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.074
Take him back. Not a mark on him.

25:23.897 --> 25:28.067
This is the best pattern I can establish.
It's sketchy at best.

25:28.235 --> 25:32.279
It's all coming from this side of town.
The nest would be around here, right?

25:32.447 --> 25:34.240
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

25:34.407 --> 25:37.785
Problem is there's 35, 40 farms
out there.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.121
I've searched about half of them already,
but nothing yet.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.957
They're covering their tracks real good.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.960
Well, I guess we'll just
have to search the other half.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.464
What time is it? Where is Sam?

25:50.632 --> 25:53.968
Car's parked outside.
Probably went for a walk.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.055
- Seems like the take-a-walk type.
- Yeah, he is, but-

26:01.643 --> 26:04.853
- Where you been?
- Can I talk to you alone?

26:05.647 --> 26:08.148
You mind chilling out
for a couple minutes?

26:13.154 --> 26:14.905
Maybe we gotta rethink this hunt.

26:15.073 --> 26:17.950
What are you talking about?
Where were you?

26:18.910 --> 26:21.078
- In the nest.
- You found it?

26:21.246 --> 26:23.247
- They found me, man.
- Wha-

26:23.415 --> 26:26.333
How'd you get out?
How many did you kill?

26:26.501 --> 26:27.501
None.

26:27.669 --> 26:30.504
- They didn't just let you go.
- That's what they did.

26:30.672 --> 26:34.174
- All right, well, where is it?
- I was blindfolded. I don't know.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.344
- You gotta know something.
- We went over that bridge outside of town.

26:37.512 --> 26:40.598
Maybe we shouldn't go after them.
I don't think they're like other vampires.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.684
- I don't think they're killing people.
- You're joking.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.771
Then how do they stay alive or undead,
whatever the hell they are?

26:47.939 --> 26:50.941
The cattle mutilations.
They live off of animal blood.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.528
- And you believed them?
- Look at me, Dean.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.405
They let me go without a scratch.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.699
Wait, so you're saying...?

26:59.701 --> 27:02.369
No, man. No way.
I don't know why they let you go.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.539
I don't really care.
We find them and we waste them.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.333
Why?

27:08.209 --> 27:10.461
What part of "vampires"
don't you understand?

27:10.629 --> 27:13.047
If it's supernatural, we kill it.
That's our job.

27:13.214 --> 27:14.506
No, Dean, that is not our job.

27:14.674 --> 27:18.594
Our job is hunting evil. And if these things
aren't killing people, they're not evil.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.471
Of course they're killing people.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.140
They're all the same, Sam.
They're not human, okay?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.725
We have to exterminate them.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.728
No, Dean. I don't think so, all right?
Not this time.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.438
Gordon's been on those vamps
for a year.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.316
- He knows.
- Gordon? You're taking his word for it?

27:32.484 --> 27:34.902
- That's right.
- Ellen says he's bad news.

27:35.070 --> 27:36.320
You called Ellen?

27:36.488 --> 27:39.031
And I'm supposed to listen to her?
We barely know her.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.660
- No, thanks. I'll go with Gordon.
- Because Gordon's such an old friend.

27:43.787 --> 27:47.414
You don't think I can see what this is?
He's a substitute for Dad, isn't he?

27:47.582 --> 27:49.083
- A poor one.
- Shut up, Sam.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.461
- He's not even close. Not on his best day.
- I'm not even gonna-

27:52.629 --> 27:55.422
You slap on this fake smile,
but I can see through it...

27:55.590 --> 27:57.091
...because I know how you feel, Dean.

27:57.258 --> 28:01.095
Dad's dead, and he left a hole
and it hurts so bad you can't take it.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.264
But you can't just fill up that hole
with whoever you want to.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.266
It's an insult to his memory.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.603
Okay.

28:20.782 --> 28:23.409
You can hit me all you want.
It won't change anything.

28:23.576 --> 28:24.743
I'm going to that nest.

28:24.911 --> 28:28.747
You don't wanna tell me where it is,
fine. I'll find it myself.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.003
Dean.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.466
Gordon?

28:41.469 --> 28:43.470
- You think he went after them?
- Probably.

28:43.638 --> 28:46.557
- We have to stop him.
- Really? Because I say we lend a hand.

28:46.766 --> 28:50.102
Just give me the benefit of the doubt,
would you? You owe me that.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.980
Yeah, we'll see.
I'll drive. Give me the keys.

28:56.651 --> 28:58.485
He snaked the keys.

28:58.653 --> 28:59.945
I can't believe this.

29:01.322 --> 29:02.823
I just fixed her up too.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.455
The bridge, is that all you got?

29:09.622 --> 29:12.332
The bridge was four and a half minutes
from their farm.

29:12.500 --> 29:15.502
- How do you know?
- I counted.

29:17.839 --> 29:21.800
They took a left out of the farm,
then turned right onto a dirt road.

29:21.968 --> 29:24.178
Followed that for two minutes,
slightly uphill.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.930
Then took another quick right
and we hit the bridge.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.849
You're good.

29:29.184 --> 29:30.642
A monster pain in the ass...

29:32.645 --> 29:33.937
...but you're good.

29:46.868 --> 29:49.369
- In the truck, thank you.
- We can't leave like this.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.332
Lenore, listen to me.
We need to stay and fight.

29:53.541 --> 29:55.626
They were my friends too, Eli.
My family.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.838
That's not what I'm talking about.
This is self-defense. Kill or be killed.

30:00.006 --> 30:01.882
They can't hunt us if they're dead.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.885
Killing those three
wouldn't solve anything.

30:05.094 --> 30:08.388
There's more where they came from.
We're outnumbered.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.059
This is all we can do.

30:12.227 --> 30:15.395
- Try and reason with-
- You can't reason with these people.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.232
They're gonna kill us all anyway.

30:18.650 --> 30:21.151
We should at least
take a few of them with us.

30:24.364 --> 30:26.573
I'm not giving up hope.

30:27.742 --> 30:31.328
If we can change, they can change.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.206
Now, go into town
and gather the others.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.208
We leave before sunrise.

32:03.212 --> 32:05.714
Dead man's blood, bitch.

32:48.549 --> 32:51.718
- Sam, Dean, come on in.
- Hey, Gordon, what's going on?

32:51.886 --> 32:54.638
Just poisoning Lenore here
with some dead man's blood.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.015
She's gonna tell us
where all her friends are.

32:57.558 --> 32:58.892
- Wanna help?
- Look, man-

32:59.060 --> 33:00.519
Grab a knife.

33:01.229 --> 33:03.647
I was just about to start in
on the fingers.

33:08.653 --> 33:12.906
Whoa, hey, let's all just chill out, huh?

33:13.074 --> 33:15.575
- I'm completely chill.
- Gordon, put the knife down.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.828
Sounds like it's Sammy
that needs to chill.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.247
Just step away from her, all right?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.295
You're right.

33:28.464 --> 33:30.090
I'm wasting my time here.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.759
This bitch will never talk.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.096
Might as well put her
out of her misery.

33:36.472 --> 33:39.474
I just sharpened it,
so it's completely humane.

33:39.684 --> 33:43.353
- Gordon, I'm letting her go.
You're not doing a damn thing.

33:43.604 --> 33:46.606
Hey, hey, hey.
Gordon, let's talk about this.

33:46.774 --> 33:50.610
What's there to talk about?
It's like I said, Dean, no shades of gray.

33:50.778 --> 33:53.030
Yeah, I hear you.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.032
- And I know how you feel.
- Do you?

33:55.199 --> 33:58.577
The vampire that killed your sister
deserved to die. But this-

34:00.121 --> 34:01.705
Killed my sister?

34:02.165 --> 34:05.876
That filthy fang didn't kill my sister.
It turned her.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.294
Made her one of them.

34:08.129 --> 34:11.590
So I hunted her down
and I killed her myself.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.717
- You did what?
- Wasn't my sister anymore.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.013
It wasn't human. I didn't blink.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.141
- Neither would you.
So you knew all along, then?

34:21.309 --> 34:24.393
You knew about the vampires.
You knew they weren't killing anyone.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.980
You knew about the cattle,
and you just didn't care.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.482
Care about what?

34:28.690 --> 34:30.984
A nest of vampires
suddenly acting nice?

34:31.152 --> 34:33.360
Taking a little time-out
from sucking people...

34:33.529 --> 34:37.239
...and we're supposed to buy that?
Trust me.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.327
Doesn't change what they are.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.370
And I can prove it.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.502
Let him go.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.339
- Now!
- Relax.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.382
If I wanted to kill him,
he'd already be on the floor.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.719
Just making a little point.

35:11.526 --> 35:12.943
Hey.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.861
You think she's so different?

35:16.948 --> 35:19.199
Still wanna save her? Look at her.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.538
They're all the same.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.874
Evil, bloodthirsty.

35:33.089 --> 35:36.383
No. No.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.386
You hear her, Gordon?

35:39.971 --> 35:42.764
No. No.

35:48.437 --> 35:50.313
We're done here.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.899
- Sam, get her out of here.
- Yeah.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.735
I've got you.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.238
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.575
Gordon...

36:02.577 --> 36:05.245
...I think you and I got some things
to talk about.

36:18.801 --> 36:20.594
Get out of my way.

36:21.095 --> 36:23.096
- Sorry.
- You're not serious.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.768
I'm having a hard time believing it,
but I know what I saw.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.771
If you want those vampires,
you gotta go through me.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.989
Fine.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.554
What are you doing, man?
You're doing this for a fang?

37:04.972 --> 37:07.140
Come on, Dean.
We're on the same side here.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.809
I don't think so, you sadistic bastard.

37:14.774 --> 37:18.985
You're not like your brother.
You're a killer. Like me.

37:44.512 --> 37:45.512
Oh, sorry.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.267
You know...

37:50.434 --> 37:52.727
...I might be like you...

37:52.895 --> 37:54.854
...and I might not.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.071
But you're the one tied up right now.

38:46.615 --> 38:48.491
I miss anything?

38:48.826 --> 38:50.493
Not much.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.039
- Lenore get out okay?
Yeah.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.999
All of them did.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.712
Then I guess our work here is done.

39:03.382 --> 39:05.050
How you doing, Gordy?

39:05.885 --> 39:07.344
You gotta tinkle yet?

39:07.803 --> 39:09.512
All right.

39:09.722 --> 39:11.431
Well, get comfy.

39:11.599 --> 39:16.227
We'll call someone in two or three days,
have them come out, untie you.

39:18.230 --> 39:19.939
Ready to go, Dean?

39:21.108 --> 39:22.150
Not yet.

39:28.574 --> 39:30.075
I guess this is goodbye.

39:31.786 --> 39:34.120
Well, it's been real.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.551
Okay. I'm good now.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.678
We can go.

40:03.859 --> 40:06.236
- Sam.
- Yeah?

40:06.737 --> 40:08.530
Clock me one.

40:09.198 --> 40:10.490
- What?
- Come on. Come on.

40:10.658 --> 40:13.076
I won't even hit you back. Let's go.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.121
No.

40:16.288 --> 40:19.082
Let's go. You get a freebie.
Hit me. Come on.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.877
You look like you just went 12 rounds
with a block of cement, Dean.

40:23.045 --> 40:24.963
I'll take a rain check.

40:27.925 --> 40:31.386
I wish we never took this job.
It's jacked everything up.

40:32.471 --> 40:33.930
What do you mean?

40:36.725 --> 40:39.227
Think about the hunts we went on,
our whole lives.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.146
- Okay.
- What if we killed things...

40:41.313 --> 40:44.482
...that didn't deserve killing?
I mean, the way Dad raised us-

40:44.692 --> 40:47.152
Dean, after what happened to Mom...

40:48.696 --> 40:51.698
- ...Dad did the best he could.
- I know he did.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.742
But the man wasn't perfect.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.120
And the way he raised us
to hate those things.

40:57.329 --> 41:00.748
And, man, I hate them. I do.
When I killed that vampire at the mill...

41:00.916 --> 41:04.210
...I didn't even think about it.
Hell, I even enjoyed it.

41:06.672 --> 41:07.922
You didn't kill Lenore.

41:08.674 --> 41:12.385
No, but every instinct told me to. I was
gonna kill her. I was gonna kill them all.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.887
Yeah, Dean, but you didn't.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.972
And that's what matters.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.518
Yeah.

41:24.398 --> 41:26.858
And because you're a pain in my ass.

41:29.111 --> 41:32.447
I guess I might have to stick around
and be a pain in the ass, then.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.324
Thanks.

41:36.869 --> 41:38.328
Don't mention it.
