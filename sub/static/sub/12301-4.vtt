WEBVTT

01:02.199 --> 01:05.269
- What do you got?
- Lana Walker 14, her sister Molly 5,

01:05.269 --> 01:07.495
Both taken from the bedroom
in middle of the night.

01:07.495 --> 01:08.496
Approximately what time?

01:08.496 --> 01:10.560
Two o'clock. / Okay.
Evidence of a break-in?

01:10.560 --> 01:11.673
Bedroom window.

01:11.673 --> 01:14.880
You know statistically most murders
happen in the three hours of kidnapping.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.593
That's right, so we are on the clock.

01:17.782 --> 01:20.419
I want that money available in case
there's a ransom demand.

01:20.521 --> 01:24.212
Yes, I know what time it is. Just get it done.
Theses are my kids we're talking about.

01:24.212 --> 01:25.951
Officers, is there anything we can do?

01:25.951 --> 01:28.250
Mr. Walker, you can start putting that
phone down please and

01:28.250 --> 01:30.456
allowing me to clear the scene up here.

01:30.456 --> 01:31.660
But it's my house.

01:31.660 --> 01:35.314
I understand that, but the person that broke
in here may have left something behind and

01:35.314 --> 01:38.053
I can find it making it connect to the girls.

01:38.246 --> 01:41.130
So please join your family downstairs.
All right?

01:48.036 --> 01:49.632
Okay.

01:49.814 --> 01:52.845
We got one set of footprints
which means one assailant.

01:52.845 --> 01:55.351
but two girls are missing

01:55.351 --> 01:57.699
and that's an awful lot
of baggage, isn't it?

01:57.699 --> 02:00.416
One of them is 5 years old, isn't she?

02:00.416 --> 02:02.464
So if I..

02:02.905 --> 02:06.355
If I was a 5 years old child
where would I hide? Hang on.

02:12.748 --> 02:13.951
Hi.

02:14.725 --> 02:17.499
This is a cool hiding space.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.692
Are you okay in there, Molly?

02:21.206 --> 02:22.321
Okay,

02:22.321 --> 02:24.456
Molly, we looking for your sister.

02:24.456 --> 02:26.935
And we can't find her.
And do you know where she is?

02:28.125 --> 02:29.793
He took her.

02:30.446 --> 02:31.936
Who took her?

02:35.739 --> 02:37.189
Who took her sister?

02:38.009 --> 02:39.225
She said a monster.

03:15.510 --> 03:18.457
MIAMI
2x04 Death Grip

03:41.449 --> 03:42.704
Blood?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.672
He attacked her on her own bed?

03:46.752 --> 03:50.725
You know I'm not entirely sure
that this is from the attack.

03:51.003 --> 03:53.089
It's concentrated in the
middle third of the bed

03:53.089 --> 03:54.884
I found clotting and...

03:55.158 --> 03:56.418
plus, she was 14.

03:56.418 --> 03:59.504
I think it's entirely possible
this is menstrual blood.

04:00.969 --> 04:02.459
Take a look at this.

04:02.595 --> 04:03.989
You got something?

04:06.212 --> 04:09.636
It's an oil smudge from
a nose or a forehead

04:09.636 --> 04:11.721
So he stood there looking at her.

04:15.841 --> 04:17.889
What do we have here?

04:25.309 --> 04:27.551
A Shiny purple fiber.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.907
Well, now we're looking
back at him, aren't we?

04:31.049 --> 04:32.794
Okay, speed.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.570
Let's get this to Trace.

04:34.570 --> 04:35.890
You got it.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.065
Mr. Walker, just relax your hand again.

04:48.065 --> 04:49.385
This is for the FBI?

04:49.385 --> 04:52.382
- When do they get here?
- Feds don't get involved without a reason.

04:52.382 --> 04:54.495
Ransom note, interstate transport,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.768
child under 12, that sort of thing.

04:56.768 --> 04:58.507
There must be something we can do?

04:58.671 --> 04:59.643
Yeah, there is actually.

04:59.643 --> 05:02.248
You can make a list of
all your recent contacts.

05:02.248 --> 05:03.988
Lana's and your wife's.

05:05.763 --> 05:07.347
Mrs. Walker.

05:07.803 --> 05:08.972
Can I have a minute please?

05:09.279 --> 05:12.174
Hey, listen. why don't you go
check out daddy over by thatcool truck?

05:13.765 --> 05:17.703
I'm gonna need a few things
of Lana's, a hair brush, her clothing.

05:17.703 --> 05:20.467
- So you can identify her body?
- No, let's not assume that yet.

05:20.467 --> 05:24.061
Okay? / Lieutenant,
when you find whoever did this.

05:24.061 --> 05:26.625
I just want 5 minutes alone with him.

05:26.866 --> 05:28.473
I wanna see what my baby saw.

05:28.473 --> 05:32.110
Mrs. Walker, there is a chance
that you know this person already.

05:32.254 --> 05:34.770
We don't know anybody who
would do something like this.

05:34.770 --> 05:36.207
Okay, here's what I want you to do.

05:36.207 --> 05:39.387
If you think of somebody that
you're concerned about in any way,

05:39.387 --> 05:42.519
I want you to call me
without fail, day or night.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.221
Will you do that?

05:45.092 --> 05:46.710
Crystal?

05:47.303 --> 05:48.553
Everything okay?

05:48.715 --> 05:50.317
Ah, yeah.

05:50.722 --> 05:53.067
Do you guys have a place to stay?

05:54.972 --> 05:56.404
We're not going anywhere.

05:56.867 --> 05:58.504
We wanna be here
when Lana comes back.

05:58.504 --> 06:00.457
I understand that.
But this is a crime scene.

06:00.457 --> 06:02.415
And I'm gonna need the location.

06:02.775 --> 06:04.281
All right? So think about it.

06:09.940 --> 06:13.679
The community is asking for
your support in finding this young girl.

06:13.679 --> 06:16.693
Neighbors are shocked this could
happen in their own backyard.

06:16.693 --> 06:18.574
Canals and waterways are
being searched.

06:18.574 --> 06:22.501
A command post is being
set up in a next door neighbor's garage.

06:22.501 --> 06:25.437
Lana Walker, a 14 year old
junior tennis champion

06:25.437 --> 06:28.136
was brazenly snatched from her bed
where she slept.

06:28.136 --> 06:31.514
Apparently the kidnapper entered
the house through upstairs window

06:31.514 --> 06:33.236
sometimes after midnight.

06:34.234 --> 06:35.664
Sir!

06:35.779 --> 06:37.083
I need you to step away
from the vehicle.

06:37.083 --> 06:39.813
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a Willy Camp.
I'm a volunteer.

06:39.868 --> 06:41.803
Oh. / That's fine.

06:42.239 --> 06:43.246
You can't be here, sir.

06:43.246 --> 06:45.088
I can't have you here this is
an active crime scene.

06:45.088 --> 06:46.606
Actually I live just across the street.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.558
You are using my garage
as a command post.

06:48.558 --> 06:49.688
That's nice of you.

06:50.122 --> 06:52.240
Well, anything I can do
for that poor little girl.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.698
What you can do is just hang back across
the street. / Sure, enough said.

06:55.698 --> 06:56.788
Thanks officer.

07:10.529 --> 07:13.407
H, got Lana's clothes for the scent dogs.

07:13.407 --> 07:14.986
Any connection to the purple fibers?

07:14.986 --> 07:18.274
No, nothing at her closet or her sister's
and nothing in the laundry.

07:18.274 --> 07:21.110
Okay, that's good news for us.
that means the intruder brought it in with him.

07:21.110 --> 07:22.624
and pass them out, please.

07:23.536 --> 07:24.572
Get anything?

07:24.572 --> 07:25.486
Always do.

07:25.486 --> 07:28.466
They're like cockroaches.
15 in a 10 block radius.

07:28.466 --> 07:31.787
15 registered sex offenders
in 10 blocks how was that possible?

07:31.787 --> 07:33.229
Who's the candidate?

07:33.229 --> 07:34.653
You're looking at him.

07:37.919 --> 07:39.030
We have a winner.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.624
Nice family photos, Wily.

07:43.624 --> 07:46.327
I guess the only problem is
this isn't your family is it?

07:46.327 --> 07:49.292
No, look. This is
neighborhood watch stuff.

07:49.292 --> 07:51.932
I'm supposed to document any
suspicious activity on the block.

07:51.932 --> 07:53.302
Suspicious activity.

07:53.302 --> 07:58.033
My advice to you is to remember to place
yourself in the photographs next time.

07:58.033 --> 08:00.126
Look, I haven't done anything wrong.

08:00.126 --> 08:03.356
On the contrary, Willy.,
A registered sex offender is

08:03.356 --> 08:08.814
prohibited from owning material that
is relevant to his sexual deviant behavior

08:08.814 --> 08:10.216
and you know that.

08:13.564 --> 08:15.398
I found more of these in his house.

08:15.398 --> 08:18.210
Okay, see what we have here.

08:25.003 --> 08:26.457
These are just of the boy.

08:26.806 --> 08:30.577
You got it. I just checked the county
list of registered sex offenders.

08:30.577 --> 08:34.001
Willy's interests don't
extend past young boys.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.186
Is that true, Willy?

08:45.508 --> 08:48.724
Horatio. / H.
Search dog just alerted, quad 3.

08:48.724 --> 08:51.010
- You find a girl, Eric?
- Not exactly.

08:51.010 --> 08:52.742
Okay, what does that mean?

08:53.149 --> 08:54.614
Think you better get over here.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.049
I'll call emergency services.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.771
Tell them to call off the search teams.

09:08.771 --> 09:11.981
On the contrary, double the teams
she may still be alive.

09:12.605 --> 09:14.532
We're just getting started.

09:14.723 --> 09:17.552
Knock and talk's turned up a witness
down the street from the Walker's house.

09:17.552 --> 09:18.659
Oh, what did they have to say?

09:18.659 --> 09:21.007
They heard a car tear out
of there after midnight.

09:21.007 --> 09:22.430
They get the make and model?

09:22.430 --> 09:24.242
Ah, they actually didn't see anything.

09:24.242 --> 09:26.712
Oh, well, I know I don't have to tell you
but, if they can't ID the car.

09:26.712 --> 09:28.374
No, I got it on tape.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.992
They're making a video.

09:30.411 --> 09:31.869
At midnight?

09:32.588 --> 09:33.909
It was a personal video.

09:38.868 --> 09:40.271
That's different.

09:40.617 --> 09:42.304
Someone's been doing you.

09:46.298 --> 09:47.787
You guys have a stapler?

09:48.470 --> 09:52.512
No, but you are the third one to
ask in the last 10 minutes.

09:53.352 --> 09:55.330
Do you want us to burn you a copy?

10:02.909 --> 10:04.565
That's our mystery car.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.225
Can you back up?

10:11.523 --> 10:13.009
Sounds like he hit something.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.456
Yeah, car bottomed out.

10:15.843 --> 10:18.069
Well, either way, he might
have left some transfer.

10:21.823 --> 10:23.828
It's an undercarriage scrape.

10:26.206 --> 10:28.003
Looks like fiberglass.

10:28.672 --> 10:31.592
So I guess the kidnapper was
driving a red sports car.

10:31.592 --> 10:34.033
- It's not exactly subtle.
- Neither is murder.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.825
- You wanna run this?
- No, man.

10:35.825 --> 10:37.732
You do the scrape.
I'll do the tape.

10:37.892 --> 10:39.430
See what I can get off the video.

10:40.702 --> 10:41.931
Fair enough.

10:43.482 --> 10:45.503
Skin on the fingertips is sloughed off.

10:45.503 --> 10:48.359
We'll have to run DNA to
compare this to Lana Walker.

10:48.359 --> 10:49.614
You got a hairbrush.

10:49.614 --> 10:51.441
I'll get this to histopath.

10:51.636 --> 10:55.119
See where the she was alive or dead
when the arm was severed.

10:55.848 --> 10:57.170
What is that?

11:03.720 --> 11:07.171
- Some kind of a tooth.
- Something's been gnawing on this tissue.

11:08.030 --> 11:09.762
Maybe one of the dogs?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.089
Eric.

11:11.295 --> 11:12.226
Hold on a second, what's up?

11:12.226 --> 11:13.356
Take a look at this.

11:13.356 --> 11:15.739
- What you got?
- Does this look like a dog tooth to you?

11:16.662 --> 11:21.313
No, Seems like an alligator.
Curved, conical for gripping, drowning its pray.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.077
Bite's 3,000 pounds
pressure per square inch.

11:24.522 --> 11:25.689
Death grip. / Okay,

11:25.689 --> 11:28.013
Well, you know that means.
we need to look in this canal.

11:28.013 --> 11:29.390
get you suit on, huh?

11:29.390 --> 11:30.532
I'm on it.

11:32.786 --> 11:35.646
- Excuse me, I'm looking for the lieutenant.
- Oh, I'm sorry this is a crime scene.

11:35.646 --> 11:38.387
- No, I need to.. I got to see..
- We may have a problem.

11:38.387 --> 11:39.257
- Oh, boy.
- I have to go in there.

11:39.257 --> 11:40.929
Okay, hang on a second.

11:41.180 --> 11:42.375
- Hang on.
- Is it true, lieutenant?

11:42.375 --> 11:43.766
Mrs. Walker, hang on a second.

11:44.218 --> 11:46.192
- Thank you,
- Did they find Lana?

11:46.366 --> 11:48.633
Okay, Mrs. Walker.
You shouldn't be here right now.

11:48.633 --> 11:51.120
I heard over one of the police radios
they found some remains.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.335
We have not found anything definitive.

11:53.335 --> 11:55.269
- I will call you,
- Please just tell me.

11:55.395 --> 11:57.728
I will call you if we find something.

11:57.903 --> 12:00.183
I brought him into our lives.

12:00.332 --> 12:02.183
I made him angry.

12:02.329 --> 12:03.852
What do you talking about?

12:05.315 --> 12:07.599
My husband doesn't know.

12:07.788 --> 12:08.974
It would kill him.

12:08.974 --> 12:10.295
Who are you talking about?

12:10.295 --> 12:12.088
His name is Art Pickering.

12:12.088 --> 12:13.413
He was going through a divorce and

12:13.413 --> 12:15.201
John was spending
so much time with Lana

12:15.201 --> 12:16.689
traveling to tournaments.

12:16.689 --> 12:18.287
And you have a relationship
with this man?

12:18.287 --> 12:20.070
I ended it.

12:20.153 --> 12:21.572
A month ago.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.281
Art didn't like that.

12:23.281 --> 12:24.880
He got weird.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.408
Aggressive.

12:26.675 --> 12:28.032
Are we talking about violence?

12:28.032 --> 12:30.320
No, but he said,

12:30.415 --> 12:33.716
go run back to your family.
But it was the way he said it.

12:34.183 --> 12:37.254
Your perfect little family.

12:39.479 --> 12:42.348
I'm gonna need Art's
phone number. Okay?

12:50.177 --> 12:52.293
Yeah, I was seeing Crystal Walker.

12:52.445 --> 12:53.946
We went out for a couple of months.

12:53.946 --> 12:54.888
Hooked at the club.

12:54.888 --> 12:56.008
Did you know she was married?

12:56.008 --> 12:57.369
Hey, she came on to me.

12:57.369 --> 12:59.134
Said her old man was ignoring her.

12:59.134 --> 13:00.647
I got nothing to hide from you guys.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.579
How about those three domestic violence
calls you had last year with your ex?

13:04.579 --> 13:05.995
My ex?

13:05.995 --> 13:07.856
Crazy bitch would make up anything.

13:07.950 --> 13:10.070
So it's always somebody
else's fault, isn't it?

13:10.070 --> 13:13.491
Your file also says you kidnapped
your own kid.

13:13.491 --> 13:14.874
That was legit.
We took a trip.

13:14.874 --> 13:16.780
Without your wife's concent.

13:16.780 --> 13:19.283
State police picked you up 500 miles away.

13:19.405 --> 13:20.326
Hang on a second.

13:20.326 --> 13:21.505
Yeah.

13:21.617 --> 13:23.647
Speed, what do you get?

13:23.773 --> 13:25.285
Okay.

13:25.553 --> 13:26.828
One more question, Art.

13:26.828 --> 13:29.431
What color is your car?

13:29.664 --> 13:31.582
It's red. Why?

13:31.881 --> 13:33.669
Let's go take a look at it.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.269
Viper.

13:36.409 --> 13:37.834
Torch red.

13:37.970 --> 13:40.182
Nice. / You know what they say?

13:40.527 --> 13:41.959
You are what you drive.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.904
Hmm, I was thinking the same thing.

13:43.904 --> 13:45.287
Mind if I have a look?

13:45.287 --> 13:46.604
Pop that trunk will you?

13:47.492 --> 13:48.986
Go ahead.

13:56.862 --> 13:58.149
Thank you.

14:06.180 --> 14:08.108
Now what,

14:10.058 --> 14:13.669
what do we have here.
That is a purple fiber.

14:14.128 --> 14:16.676
Every contact leaves a trace.

14:16.676 --> 14:18.392
Edmond Locard.

14:18.554 --> 14:21.431
- Who's that?
- Mr. Locard is the man

14:21.431 --> 14:23.154
who just got you arrested.

14:23.593 --> 14:24.906
I didn't have anything
to do with that girl.

14:24.906 --> 14:28.728
Then how did the exact fiber from her
bedroom window end up in your car trunk?

14:28.728 --> 14:29.979
I don't know.

14:29.979 --> 14:35.637
Identical strand,
dye lot number 207.

14:35.637 --> 14:37.807
Identical color.

14:37.995 --> 14:40.565
What are you talking about?
Is this some kind of trick?

14:40.565 --> 14:42.276
There is no color here.

14:43.338 --> 14:45.411
Art, tell me something.

14:46.345 --> 14:50.434
Have you ever been treated
for a vitamin A deficiency?

14:50.861 --> 14:52.200
Yeah.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.640
How do you know that?
Excessive blinking from dry eyes

14:54.640 --> 14:57.738
you can't see the color purple, can you?

15:04.645 --> 15:06.038
You're going to arrest me for that, too?

15:06.038 --> 15:07.581
I wish I could, Art,

15:07.581 --> 15:09.855
I wish I could.
Cut him loose.

15:16.533 --> 15:18.215
All right, I'm lost.

15:18.407 --> 15:19.591
He has night blindness.

15:19.591 --> 15:22.139
So he couldn't possibly
driven to the house to pick up the girl.

15:22.139 --> 15:25.908
Okay, what about the fibers
you found in his trunk?

15:25.908 --> 15:27.584
Fibers are a tie-in.

15:27.584 --> 15:29.038
Bear with me.

15:45.519 --> 15:47.733
GMAC's best sound engineer.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.614
Calleigh Duquesne, long time.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.952
- Hey, Todd
- You still drive that little in-line 4?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.510
Oh, no. I traded up.

15:53.510 --> 15:57.266
4.6 liter dual overhead cam,
multiport fuel injection.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.152
I love it when a woman talks dirty.

15:59.152 --> 16:01.347
Hey, were you able to get anything
on that mystery car?

16:01.347 --> 16:02.571
I did.

16:02.721 --> 16:04.766
It took a bit of heavy listening.

16:07.796 --> 16:09.182
She revs high.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.676
Definitely 8 cylinders or better.

16:12.148 --> 16:14.622
Auto tranny, aluminum block,.

16:14.753 --> 16:16.012
Driver's a cheap bastard.

16:16.012 --> 16:17.276
Really? How do you figure?

16:17.276 --> 16:18.676
Well hear that pinging?

16:18.676 --> 16:22.767
Yeah. / He's using a lower-octane gas
than the manufacturer has recommend.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.225
Now that's criminal.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.598
Not if it helps us find him.

16:25.598 --> 16:28.038
Hey, do you think you can get me
any closer to a make and model?

16:32.031 --> 16:33.528
It's definitely not.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.847
No match.

16:57.847 --> 16:59.594
Well, at least we gave it a shot.

16:59.594 --> 17:01.567
No, not yet we haven't.

17:01.705 --> 17:03.474
Those are the only 2003 models.

17:03.474 --> 17:05.914
You wanna order out?
This could take a while.

17:11.152 --> 17:13.111
Hey, I hear you got a suspect?

17:13.470 --> 17:15.631
He's not our guy.
How are you doing?

17:15.631 --> 17:18.275
Well, the engine noise we got
was from LT-5 V-8

17:18.275 --> 17:22.672
it was made by GM for Corvette
for the 01 series from '90 to '95.

17:22.672 --> 17:24.357
Very good.
Okay, here's what we do.

17:24.357 --> 17:26.719
- Let's put out an Amber Alert.
- You got it.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.302
Hey, this is CSI Calleigh Duquesne.

17:32.302 --> 17:36.058
I need to call in an Amber Alert
for a '01 corvette.

17:36.465 --> 17:38.000
Torch red.

17:42.806 --> 17:44.637
Trucker spotted the car in highway 1.

17:44.637 --> 17:48.541
DMV confirms registeration to a one,
David Kendall with an address in the grove.

17:48.541 --> 17:50.366
Okay. / Guess what he does for living.

17:50.366 --> 17:52.000
Tennis dude. Speed.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.340
Paint's a match.

17:53.904 --> 17:56.460
There's a scrape under here.
He definitely bottomed out.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.454
What's your status?

17:59.343 --> 18:01.121
Stat. Ready to approach the door.

18:01.573 --> 18:02.920
You got a green light.

18:10.110 --> 18:13.540
Lieutenant. / What the hell,
Take him, take him. go, go

18:13.540 --> 18:15.010
You with the bag.
You with the bag.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.788
Drop the bag.
Drop down to your knees.

18:16.788 --> 18:19.057
Drop down to your knees.
Move. Move.

18:19.313 --> 18:21.151
Now all the way down.

18:21.322 --> 18:22.761
Move move.

18:28.723 --> 18:30.090
Clear. / All right.

18:31.089 --> 18:32.398
Okay, all right.

18:32.398 --> 18:34.332
What did you do with the girl, partner?

18:34.869 --> 18:37.216
- What did you do with the girl?
- Got eye shadow, biginner blue.

18:37.216 --> 18:38.120
Where is the...

18:40.173 --> 18:41.318
Leave him alone.

18:41.318 --> 18:43.247
- Leave him alone.
- Lana? Are you okay?

18:43.247 --> 18:45.954
Yes, I'm very okay.
I'm great.

18:45.954 --> 18:47.253
He didn't hurt you anyway.

18:47.253 --> 18:48.936
No. what do you talking about?

18:48.936 --> 18:50.981
David would never hurt me.
Is he in trouble?

18:50.981 --> 18:53.861
I don't want you to worry about that.
Now, right now I want you go with this officer.

18:53.861 --> 18:55.017
Go ahead take her.

18:56.359 --> 18:57.678
Go ahead.

18:57.955 --> 18:58.965
Go with him.

19:03.882 --> 19:05.755
He didn't hurt her anyway.

19:05.850 --> 19:07.625
We'll get her alone in a room.

19:07.625 --> 19:08.993
We'll find out the truth.

19:09.425 --> 19:10.777
Won't we?

19:13.964 --> 19:17.689
Are you telling us David Kendall did not
break into your room?

19:17.689 --> 19:19.529
I left a window unlocked.

19:19.922 --> 19:21.089
What would you do that?

19:21.089 --> 19:22.876
Because David ask me to?

19:22.876 --> 19:27.443
Okay. Did Mr. Kendall coerece you
or sexually assault you, Lana?

19:29.608 --> 19:31.438
You don't get it. Do you?

19:36.691 --> 19:38.225
We made love.

19:38.665 --> 19:41.448
He said he would come get me some night
and we go way together.

19:41.448 --> 19:42.680
And he finally did. / Okay.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.468
Lana I know this is hard to understand

19:44.468 --> 19:49.371
but when a grown man gets himself involved
with a 14 year girl he's not a good guy

19:49.371 --> 19:51.380
and there are the laws against
what he's done to you.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.885
They shouldn't be.

19:52.885 --> 19:55.229
We're like equals. I love him.

19:55.229 --> 19:57.692
He was coaching her
for almost two years.

19:57.692 --> 20:00.021
Before school, after school,

20:01.197 --> 20:03.066
weekends. / And always alone.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.780
Yeah, to keep her focus.
You know,

20:04.780 --> 20:06.874
No distractions he insisted.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.750
How long has he been doing
this to my daughter?

20:08.750 --> 20:11.675
According to Lana, 4 months.

20:11.819 --> 20:14.083
Why wasn't he on
a contact list you gave us?

20:14.083 --> 20:15.969
Because we weren't in contact.

20:15.969 --> 20:18.013
We fired that son of bitch last month.

20:18.013 --> 20:19.540
Why did you do that?

20:20.260 --> 20:23.396
She wasn't advancing fast enough.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.874
But she's got typical tennis parents.

20:26.874 --> 20:30.250
They all think their little girls can
be the next Serena or Venus.

20:30.250 --> 20:32.340
But you stayed in touch.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.803
Did you?

20:33.803 --> 20:35.278
She called me.

20:38.610 --> 20:40.362
You got nothing.

20:40.362 --> 20:42.073
Try statutory rape.

20:44.043 --> 20:49.380
Sex was consensual. / Yes, but not
when the victim's a 14 year old girl.

20:53.936 --> 20:56.140
I guess I got nothing
to worry about then.

20:56.719 --> 20:58.158
Right?

20:58.614 --> 21:00.606
Now why is that. Dave?

21:02.275 --> 21:04.362
We lied about her age.

21:05.776 --> 21:08.075
You... lied about her age?

21:08.075 --> 21:09.826
It was his idea.

21:09.891 --> 21:11.893
You wanna her career
as much as I did... / You insisted.

21:11.893 --> 21:13.909
I gave her an edge.
You know, how competitive tennis is.

21:13.909 --> 21:16.597
Excuse me. / We did for Lana.
No, John. We did it for you.

21:16.597 --> 21:19.806
- This has always been about what you want.
- I supposed you wanted Art Pickering, too.

21:19.806 --> 21:21.371
Excuse me.

21:21.371 --> 21:23.164
He's a gigolo.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.369
Well, he's good at his job.

21:26.623 --> 21:27.941
Finished?

21:32.219 --> 21:35.722
Mr. and Mrs. Walker.
How old is Lana exactly?

21:36.932 --> 21:38.460
16.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.178
16. When is her birthday?

21:40.478 --> 21:42.337
About 6 months ago.

21:42.542 --> 21:43.903
But she's still a minor right?

21:43.903 --> 21:46.053
In the state of Florida,
if you're 16 or over

21:46.053 --> 21:49.149
you can have a sexual partner up
to the age of 24.

21:49.695 --> 21:51.876
Mr. Kendall is 23.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.924
So he walks out of here?

21:53.924 --> 21:55.492
Legally he's done nothing wrong.

21:55.492 --> 21:57.330
He took advantage of our daughter.

21:57.330 --> 21:59.993
Yeah, and he is not alone, Is he?

21:59.993 --> 22:01.246
Dad?

22:16.551 --> 22:18.153
Well, he got away with it.

22:18.153 --> 22:19.676
Not yet he hasn't.

22:20.636 --> 22:22.194
He's gonna do it again.

22:22.262 --> 22:24.488
Or already has.

22:24.488 --> 22:27.258
Here's what we do.
Let's go take another look at that arm.

22:27.258 --> 22:28.548
All right?

23:34.132 --> 23:35.860
The spectra was a bust.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.140
There's nothing in the soil or the water
to tell us whether this arm might have been.

23:39.140 --> 23:42.143
Okay, ladies? / Length of the
metacarpals were consistent

23:42.143 --> 23:45.451
with those of a teenaged girl,
approximately five four to five-six.

23:45.451 --> 23:47.711
But the musculature's a different story.

23:47.711 --> 23:51.256
The flexor and extensor in the forearm
is overdeveloped for her age.

23:51.256 --> 23:53.140
She worked out?
Way too much.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.273
She's got a early symptoms
of lateral epicondylitis.

23:57.216 --> 23:58.637
Tennis elbow?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.345
Yeah, right here.

24:00.539 --> 24:04.336
Micro-tears in the tendon.
Probably caused from repetitive use of the arm

24:07.493 --> 24:10.155
So she may have had contact
with our tennis dude.

24:10.155 --> 24:11.581
What about the tissue itself?

24:11.581 --> 24:15.078
It's non-hemorrhagic so she was dead
when the gator got her arm.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.983
So we are looking for her body.

24:21.296 --> 24:22.678
Yeah, speed.

24:22.847 --> 24:25.126
Hold on a second. It's Delko. / Okay.

24:25.759 --> 24:27.156
Eric. / H.

24:27.156 --> 24:29.210
Yeah, we rolled snake eyes at the canal.

24:29.210 --> 24:31.232
Okay, can we expand the search?

24:31.232 --> 24:32.795
Yeah, we'll, uh..

24:32.795 --> 24:34.955
start looking for nests,
see what we can found.

24:34.955 --> 24:38.166
Okay, Eric. we got a million gators
down here. Where do you gonna start?

24:38.166 --> 24:40.688
Old college buddy of mine is
in town and uh.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.427
He's kind of an expert in the field.
Let me see if he can do to help.

24:43.427 --> 24:45.985
Okay. Make use of him
and keep me posted.

24:58.811 --> 25:00.679
Don't try this at home, guys.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.129
I'm a professional,
This is exactly what we looking for.

25:05.631 --> 25:07.554
It's a perfect specimen.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.866
- This is the American alligator.
- Cut, cut, cut.

25:09.866 --> 25:12.023
We lost sound.

25:13.405 --> 25:16.558
Hey, animal guy, you think that
gator's coming back for "take two"?

25:17.182 --> 25:18.615
Eric Delko.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.104
Delko.

25:20.104 --> 25:21.734
Thought you fell off the planet.
You look great.

25:21.734 --> 25:24.573
How's it going, man? / Awesome
The last time I saw you were...

25:24.573 --> 25:27.022
- Well, we won't talk about that.
- Oh, yeah. Let's not. Please,Okay?

25:27.022 --> 25:28.998
- Calleigh Duquesne, Jeff Corwin.
- Pleasure to meet you.

25:28.998 --> 25:30.453
Fraternity brothers at U of M.

25:30.453 --> 25:31.614
Pleasure's all mine.

25:31.614 --> 25:32.591
Easy.

25:33.253 --> 25:36.429
Now I hear you guys some
sort of a reptile situation.

25:36.429 --> 25:38.378
Yeah, more like a needle
in the haystack.

25:38.378 --> 25:41.184
We are... we are looking
for the gator that belongs to this.

25:41.599 --> 25:44.148
Well, I could tell you this
you're not gonna find him.

25:44.148 --> 25:45.261
Look at the shape of this tooth.

25:45.261 --> 25:47.370
See that?
It's conical, it has those ridges...

25:47.370 --> 25:49.413
alligators don't have teeth like this.

25:49.413 --> 25:51.696
There is only one animal
that has this tooth.

25:51.696 --> 25:53.401
And that's the american crocodile.

25:53.401 --> 25:54.619
Not the alligator.

25:54.619 --> 25:57.477
Oh, okay, I thought crocodiles were
only down in the keys.

25:57.477 --> 26:00.283
Well, they are down in the keys.
But in fact they've been migrating up

26:00.283 --> 26:04.320
and today we have about 3,000 of them
living around the southern part of Florida

26:04.320 --> 26:06.642
Ah. Like you said, needle in a haystack.

26:06.765 --> 26:10.625
Well, not really you see, they're all pretty
much living at the nuclear power plant.

26:10.625 --> 26:11.478
Really?

26:11.478 --> 26:12.496
Because of the heat, right?

26:12.496 --> 26:16.250
Exactly, it's kind of like their own
privately heated swimming pool.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.634
Okay, how many of them
hanging out there,you think?

26:18.634 --> 26:21.510
That's the beauty of it.
All 3,000 of them.

26:25.903 --> 26:27.292
Mr. Pickering.

26:32.736 --> 26:35.461
I was the wrong guy this morning
I'm the still the wrong guy this afternoon.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.525
Yes, you mentioned that.

26:36.525 --> 26:39.278
Do you know anybody
named David Kendall?

26:41.137 --> 26:42.657
He's a pro at the club.
I've seen him around.

26:42.657 --> 26:45.122
Did you ever give him a ride
in your pretty red car?

26:45.122 --> 26:46.534
No, no. Never.

26:47.059 --> 26:48.480
Okay, I need to understand

26:48.480 --> 26:53.109
how the purple fiber that he brought
to the kidnapping ended up in your car.

26:53.345 --> 26:54.945
I already told you, I don't know.

26:55.373 --> 26:58.553
Okay, would you mind
if I took a look in your shed here?

26:59.095 --> 27:00.397
Knock yourself out.

27:00.443 --> 27:01.723
Okay.

27:01.846 --> 27:04.034
Let's start with these boxes.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.125
All righty.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.054
Rock & Stone, huh?

27:11.099 --> 27:13.160
Pickering Rock & Stone.

27:13.292 --> 27:14.768
You sponsor a lot of sports teams?

27:14.768 --> 27:17.042
I'm a community-minded kind of guy.

27:17.042 --> 27:18.150
Yeah, I bet you are.

27:18.150 --> 27:20.705
Maybe you're just looking
for a tax write-off, huh?

27:20.974 --> 27:22.788
Charity works both ways.

27:23.909 --> 27:25.520
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

27:27.443 --> 27:28.899
Here's what I need.

27:30.509 --> 27:34.487
I'm gonna need a list of all the places
that you handed these out.

27:34.963 --> 27:35.997
Okay?

27:50.501 --> 27:53.800
There's Art Pickering's T-shirts.
So I guess he was telling the truth.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.783
I spoke to the director over the phone,

27:55.783 --> 27:57.998
Kendall spend one day a week here.

27:58.342 --> 27:59.760
Coaching for free.

27:59.975 --> 28:02.406
That's why this place didn't
show up on his client list.

28:02.406 --> 28:06.186
I bet you they think he's a saint
for all his community service work, too. Huh?

28:06.291 --> 28:08.379
Well, we know our victim played tennis.

28:08.717 --> 28:11.795
I guess let's start looking for anyone
who hasn't shown up lately.

28:12.511 --> 28:13.761
We may not have to.

28:13.761 --> 28:15.104
Take a look at that.

28:15.656 --> 28:17.615
Consuela Valdez.

28:18.778 --> 28:20.197
Desaparecida.

28:21.451 --> 28:22.635
Disappeared.

28:23.146 --> 28:25.493
Horatio, this is Francisco and Milagra Valdez.

28:25.493 --> 28:28.031
They said their daughter,
Consuela went missing three weeks ago.

28:28.031 --> 28:30.295
Mr. and Mrs. Valdez, have you ever
spoken to the police yet?

28:30.295 --> 28:32.425
The police said she ran away from home.

28:32.559 --> 28:35.054
They say a girl of 15 is often a go-away.

28:35.054 --> 28:37.135
- Did she run away from home often?
- Never, never.

28:37.135 --> 28:38.756
Consuela is a very good girl.

28:38.756 --> 28:39.856
Pera nina

28:39.856 --> 28:41.263
We kept her off the streets.

28:41.263 --> 28:44.269
kept her in involved organizaciones.

28:44.976 --> 28:46.112
She lives for tennis.

28:46.112 --> 28:49.373
Did she ever receive instruction
from a man named David Kendall?

28:49.862 --> 28:52.764
Senor David. Yes, yes,
he gave her free lessons.

28:52.764 --> 28:55.184
He was very generous to her,
to all of us.

28:55.184 --> 28:58.568
He even drove us in his car looking for

28:58.568 --> 29:00.304
For her when she...

29:00.304 --> 29:01.775
Desaparecida.

29:02.231 --> 29:04.915
Did she own a sweatshirt with
purple lettering on it?

29:04.915 --> 29:07.214
She was wearing it
the last time we saw her.

29:10.398 --> 29:11.647
I'm sorry.

29:14.228 --> 29:15.904
No.

29:16.123 --> 29:19.009
We need something of
your daughter's to verify our finding.

29:19.686 --> 29:22.764
What? Why didn't they help us?

29:22.764 --> 29:24.174
We begged for help.

29:26.402 --> 29:27.957
No one cares.

29:27.957 --> 29:29.546
That's not true.

29:29.546 --> 29:31.143
Almost no one.

30:02.936 --> 30:03.985
All right people, here's a drill.

30:03.985 --> 30:07.104
These animals are very powerful.
The last thing you wanna do..

30:07.104 --> 30:09.742
is get any of your limbs inside
one of these creature's mouths.

30:09.742 --> 30:11.230
If you do, You'll lose it.

30:11.230 --> 30:13.562
Any questions? / Yeah.
I got a question for you, Jeff.

30:13.562 --> 30:16.169
Ah. How are we supposed to know
if we find the right one?

30:16.169 --> 30:18.002
Okay, well, that's easy.

30:18.759 --> 30:20.473
All of you guys have trackers.

30:20.473 --> 30:21.559
Okay?

30:21.559 --> 30:25.307
Basically part of the management
program of endangered species

30:25.307 --> 30:28.656
is that every one of these animals has
been implanted with a microchip

30:28.656 --> 30:30.838
through a syringe into the skin.

30:36.290 --> 30:41.767
And just take the mini trackers and pass it along
the crocodile's back like a checkout scanner.

30:47.154 --> 30:48.525
Look at the reading.

30:48.525 --> 30:54.189
and DNA tells us from the tooth that
we recovered that lucky croc's number 0116.

30:54.189 --> 30:56.336
Get that one, we got it.
Let's go.

32:02.532 --> 32:03.537
Hold on.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.543
Hurry up.

32:07.371 --> 32:08.932
That's it. It's our croc.

32:08.932 --> 32:10.578
Get Horatio Caine on the phone.

32:18.575 --> 32:21.076
It's a shame to have to kill animals for
doing what comes naturally.

32:21.076 --> 32:22.987
Guys, we can't kill this animal I mean,

32:22.987 --> 32:24.348
it's endangered.
It's federally protected.

32:24.348 --> 32:26.601
Okay, let's irrigate his stomach then.

32:26.601 --> 32:29.314
All right. Let's just see
what he coughs up.

32:34.356 --> 32:35.662
There we go, okay.

32:35.662 --> 32:38.489
Close his jaw. awesome.

32:38.873 --> 32:40.122
All right.

32:40.122 --> 32:41.607
All right. Hit the pump.

32:54.703 --> 32:56.917
We got some fishes there and

32:57.976 --> 33:00.139
some crab and

33:00.139 --> 33:01.512
some... foot.

33:11.334 --> 33:13.362
Stomach acid's done its damage.

33:13.362 --> 33:15.945
But tennis shoe and adolescent bone.

33:15.945 --> 33:18.056
I'd put money this is our girl.

33:18.752 --> 33:20.840
Purple fibers.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.655
Thinking passive transfer.

33:24.905 --> 33:27.425
He picked up the fibers
from Consuela's body.

33:30.167 --> 33:32.835
So that means he must have worn
the same jacket to Lana's.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.000
Links our two girls together.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.689
The Man in the middle is still
in the missing link.

33:41.609 --> 33:42.914
Hey,

33:43.154 --> 33:44.191
Are you okay?

33:44.191 --> 33:47.764
Blonde girl's missing and
the National Guard turns out to help.

33:47.841 --> 33:50.019
Hispanic girl, no one gives a damn.

33:50.332 --> 33:51.977
I think there are a lot of people here.

33:51.977 --> 33:55.699
Oh, come on Calleigh, You saw
the media's response to Lana Walker.

33:56.179 --> 33:59.012
You know, where, where,
where's the yellow ribbons for Consuela Valdez?

33:59.012 --> 34:01.399
Recovery center.
It's the same song, you know?

34:01.399 --> 34:05.782
You wanna any real attention in this world
you got to have blonde hair and blue eyes.

34:07.226 --> 34:08.949
No offence.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.067
None taken.

34:11.239 --> 34:13.123
My eyes are green.

34:17.478 --> 34:20.710
I'm just mad we couldn't save her...

34:24.795 --> 34:26.297
Let's go get this guy.

34:28.054 --> 34:29.377
Yeah.

34:34.304 --> 34:37.214
You wanna your grip to
be firm but supple...

34:37.214 --> 34:38.170
All right.

34:38.603 --> 34:40.030
Little loose. / Thank you.

34:43.493 --> 34:45.947
Not bad? / Yeah. it's better already.

34:47.958 --> 34:49.139
One minute, Tiff

34:51.170 --> 34:52.985
Firm but supple.

34:54.567 --> 34:57.120
You got a real racquet going
here don't you Dave?

34:57.913 --> 34:59.504
Racquet.

34:59.726 --> 35:02.177
Never heard that before
Listen I don't want to rain on your parade

35:02.177 --> 35:04.264
how does child abduction sound to you?

35:04.264 --> 35:05.868
Lana loves me.
There's no abduction involved.

35:05.868 --> 35:11.258
Is that right?
I'm talking about Consuela Valdez.

35:11.438 --> 35:12.805
Sound familiar?

35:13.510 --> 35:15.781
Your strings are tightening
on that one, huh?

35:15.781 --> 35:17.263
Look, I helped look for Consuela.

35:17.263 --> 35:19.257
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

35:19.257 --> 35:21.138
And you transferred.

35:21.633 --> 35:26.401
You transferred fibers from her
sweatshirt into Lana's bedroom.

35:26.829 --> 35:28.519
Fibers? / Yes.

35:28.519 --> 35:30.798
I'm a fiber king David,

35:31.181 --> 35:33.851
I'm the fiber king.
So what do you wanna do?

35:33.989 --> 35:36.002
Easy or hard.
It's up to you.

35:36.656 --> 35:38.103
Easy for you?

35:38.297 --> 35:40.348
David. Come on,
we have 25 more minutes.

35:40.348 --> 35:42.936
- One minute, Tiff
- Tiffany. Lesson is over.

35:42.936 --> 35:46.151
- You gonna come with me.
- But my parents, they pay for 50 minutes.

35:46.151 --> 35:47.761
I mean, I think they gonna
want their money's worth.

35:47.761 --> 35:50.542
I understand and
I think they'll understand.

35:50.542 --> 35:51.880
All right?

35:53.743 --> 35:55.430
You had your chance.

35:56.150 --> 35:59.659
Come on tiffany I'm lieutenant Caine
Miami Dade Crime Lab.

36:05.158 --> 36:06.365
Hey, thank you.

36:10.454 --> 36:13.166
Ms. Walker
She ran away again. Lana.

36:13.166 --> 36:15.828
She left me a note. She said,
"not to come after her this time"

36:15.828 --> 36:17.871
I called David Kendall's house
and the phone just rings.

36:17.871 --> 36:19.295
One thing at a time.

36:19.295 --> 36:22.272
Your daughter Lana is
still a minor. Okay?

36:22.272 --> 36:25.074
So I'll walk you over to missing
persons so you can file a report.

36:25.074 --> 36:27.703
- I know she's with David Kendall.
- I understand.

36:27.703 --> 36:29.718
But the law is about
what you can prove.

36:29.718 --> 36:30.875
Okay?

36:31.130 --> 36:32.208
This way.

36:35.833 --> 36:38.471
Some kind of binding
around the ankle.

36:39.660 --> 36:41.846
Someone tied her up.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.488
Restrained her.

36:47.359 --> 36:49.512
I've seen that string before.

36:53.830 --> 36:57.445
The string from the leg is identical
to the strings from Kendall's bag.

36:57.445 --> 37:00.979
So if I just can match up the pattern
and the angle of the cut.

37:00.979 --> 37:03.192
We can tie him to the Valdez girl.

37:03.320 --> 37:04.368
Okay.

37:06.112 --> 37:07.331
They don't line up.

37:07.331 --> 37:11.428
Okay, but that doesn't mean they're not from
the same source though, doesn't it?

37:15.692 --> 37:18.077
Bye, Later.

37:18.077 --> 37:19.953
Keep me posted.

37:21.648 --> 37:23.044
Mr. Valdez.

37:23.299 --> 37:27.110
Mr. Valdez, you mentioned that
Mr. Kendall gave Consuela gifts.

37:27.110 --> 37:28.138
Yes,

37:28.138 --> 37:29.484
Could I see those?

37:39.521 --> 37:41.803
Don't let him do this to another family.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.834
You have my word on it.

37:44.370 --> 37:45.904
Okay?

38:16.590 --> 38:19.875
String from the leg to
the racquets to the bag.

38:19.875 --> 38:21.406
A to B to C.

38:21.406 --> 38:23.302
All from the same spool of strings.

38:23.652 --> 38:28.454
Okay, bottom line is David Kendall bound
the Valdez girl with this string

38:28.454 --> 38:31.849
and now we've got forensic proof.
Nice going.

38:32.219 --> 38:35.038
Yelina. we got Kendall. Let's draw
up a warrant; let's pick him up.

38:35.038 --> 38:37.168
Good. Mrs. Walker will be pleased.

38:37.285 --> 38:38.753
Her daughter ran away again.

38:38.753 --> 38:40.076
- When did that happen?
- Today,

38:40.076 --> 38:41.795
I helped her file a missing persons.

38:41.795 --> 38:43.261
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

38:43.261 --> 38:45.455
- What time did you file?
- A couple of hours ago.

38:45.455 --> 38:47.324
- I dealt with it.
- Okay, that's not my point.

38:47.324 --> 38:48.722
Now she's gonna deal with it.

39:06.490 --> 39:09.161
I'll kill you before I let you
touch my daughter. / No, mom.

39:09.531 --> 39:11.325
Mrs. Walker,

39:12.806 --> 39:15.256
Mrs. Walker, don't do this.

39:15.256 --> 39:17.381
Mrs. Walker,
Don't make this mistake.

39:17.614 --> 39:19.527
He's not gonna stop. / No.

39:19.690 --> 39:21.516
That's not true, we have him.

39:21.686 --> 39:25.522
We have him for killing
another little girl, just like...

39:25.522 --> 39:27.155
just like Lana.

39:27.889 --> 39:29.798
- He's gonna get away with it.
- No, he's not.

39:29.798 --> 39:32.105
But if you make
this mistake, Mrs. Walker.

39:32.105 --> 39:35.295
Lana loses you
and you lose everything for him.

39:35.295 --> 39:37.951
And it's not worth it.
Give me the gun.

39:44.281 --> 39:46.060
That's great. / Oh, Lana.

39:46.637 --> 39:48.072
David, let her go.

39:48.498 --> 39:50.152
There's one thing you're missing.

39:51.822 --> 39:53.913
That Lana loves me.

39:53.913 --> 39:56.579
Tell him, tell him you love me.

39:56.709 --> 39:58.085
We're in love.

39:58.085 --> 40:00.411
Why can't you can just go away?
This is none of your business.

40:00.411 --> 40:01.461
Lana,

40:01.461 --> 40:05.212
I will be going to a memorial
for another little girl of your age

40:05.393 --> 40:07.971
who was killed by David.

40:08.262 --> 40:09.746
Right, David?

40:10.857 --> 40:13.930
Tell Lana how you killed Consuela.

40:14.035 --> 40:15.943
You don't have the guts, do you?

40:17.848 --> 40:19.178
Lana.

Come on.

40:23.863 --> 40:25.033
There you go.

40:25.033 --> 40:26.269
Down on your knees,

40:26.269 --> 40:28.684
hands behind your head. Let's go.

40:29.846 --> 40:31.252
Move!

40:37.528 --> 40:38.838
You know David?

40:38.985 --> 40:41.561
That's the first good decision
I've seen you make.

40:42.277 --> 40:43.240
Get rid of him.

40:48.910 --> 40:50.024

I can fly...

41:10.526 --> 41:15.451
But I want his wings

41:16.046 --> 41:22.116
I can shine even in the darkness

42:02.845 --> 42:04.236
Do you have any comment?

42:04.536 --> 42:05.774
I'll do better than that.

42:07.906 --> 42:10.653
- It's a list of names.
- Yes, in the last 12 months, Jake,

42:10.653 --> 42:15.061
7 Hispanic girls and 5 black girls
disappeared right here in Miami.

42:15.061 --> 42:17.319
