00:10.220 --> 00:15.099
<i>NARRATOR". We last left the Dynamic Duo
and lovely Venus in a shallow pool...</i>

00:15.266 --> 00:19.646
<i>...where a giant clam
had just swallowed Robin.</i>

00:19.812 --> 00:22.232
<i>A gruesome joke on the Joker's part.</i>

00:22.440 --> 00:25.944
<i>But now, will Venus,
or maybe Batman himself...</i>

00:26.110 --> 00:28.947
<i>...provide the clam with its next course?</i>

00:29.155 --> 00:31.991
<i>We'll see in short order.</i>

01:49.611 --> 01:52.780
It's hopeless, Batman. Hopeless.

01:52.989 --> 01:55.783
Robin's being swallowed whole...

01:55.992 --> 01:58.911
...and we'll be next.

01:59.203 --> 02:03.708
He isn't being swallowed whole, Venus.
I can still see a piece of his boot.

02:52.215 --> 02:53.841
Holy human pearls, Batman.

02:54.008 --> 02:59.055
Correction, Robin. Pearls come from oysters.
You came out of that clam.

02:59.222 --> 03:03.184
Ugh! I sure did. But how'd you get me out?

03:03.351 --> 03:06.437
He pried the clam open
with his bare hands...

03:06.646 --> 03:09.607
...and then he unchained me.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.859
How'd you break your chain, Batman?

03:12.485 --> 03:18.074
Every man has his own unknown
inner strength at a time of crisis, Robin.

03:18.241 --> 03:21.744
I'm sure had the situations been reversed,
you would've found your strength.

03:21.911 --> 03:23.913
But now we must get to the Batcave.

03:24.122 --> 03:26.833
But what to do about Venus?

03:27.125 --> 03:28.167
I know.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.754
I can borrow my friend Bruce Wayne's
midtown apartment.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.923
Sure, Batman. He hardly ever uses it.

03:34.132 --> 03:36.217
Then I'm still part of the team?

03:36.426 --> 03:39.429
After what we've all just been through,
of course you are, Venus.

03:39.637 --> 03:42.390
And I'm sure you can help us
track down Joker.

03:42.557 --> 03:47.603
Of course, you'll have to stand trial
for your earlier misdeeds.

03:47.812 --> 03:51.149
As should any citizen
who breaks the law, Batman.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.405
Where are Uranus and Mars?

03:57.572 --> 04:00.324
They should have completed
Operation Laundry Bag by now.

04:00.491 --> 04:03.202
Maybe they ran into some trouble
with the prison guards.

04:03.369 --> 04:06.998
They better not.
Operation Laundry Bag must be successful...

04:07.165 --> 04:10.585
...in order for me to complete
Aquarius and Capricorn.

04:10.752 --> 04:13.379
The final two crimes of my zodiac. Ha, ha.

04:15.339 --> 04:16.673
They're here.

04:20.887 --> 04:22.805
Yeah. Well, where is he?

04:23.014 --> 04:24.223
In the bag.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.226
- Stupid. Why didn't you let him out?
-We didn't have a chance.

04:27.393 --> 04:30.229
Warden Crichton's boys
chased us all the way from the prison.

04:30.396 --> 04:34.317
- We barely managed to ditch them.
-Well, quick, help me get him out.

04:34.734 --> 04:37.069
Waugh, Waugh, waugh.

04:38.154 --> 04:42.116
You dolts. You buffoons.
I might have suffocated.

04:42.283 --> 04:45.787
- I'm sorry, Pengy. I didn't mean to--
-"Pengy"? Mr. Penguin to you, sir.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.915
Numskull, get Penguin's clothes for him.
Hurry.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.626
Get my clothes for me? I've got them on.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.461
Oh, so you do.

04:53.628 --> 04:56.255
For a minute
I thought those were prison issue.

04:56.422 --> 05:00.176
Prisonissue?
This sartorial triumph a prison issue?

05:00.343 --> 05:02.762
Well, sometime
I'll give you the name of my tailor.

05:02.970 --> 05:06.432
Sometime I'll give you a piece of my mind.
Like right now.

05:06.599 --> 05:09.060
I don't have any other clothes for him, Joker.

05:09.227 --> 05:13.689
But-- But I got news for you.
Saturn called from the other hideout.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.108
Venus and the Caped Crusaders are gone.

05:16.317 --> 05:20.530
Well, of course they're gone. The clam
made a good meal out of them. Ha-ha-ha!

05:20.738 --> 05:24.325
The Batmobile's gone too, from outside.
The clam could haven't eaten that.

05:24.534 --> 05:28.996
Are you trying to tell me Batman, Robin and
Venus could all have escaped my clam trap?

05:29.205 --> 05:31.374
Yeah, that's the way it looks from here,
Joker.

05:31.582 --> 05:35.044
Oh, Pengy. Then I really need your help.

05:35.253 --> 05:38.381
- To do what?
-To terminate Batman once and for all.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.591
While I conclude my Zodiac Crimes.

05:40.800 --> 05:44.762
Now you're talking.
Together to the end, Jokey. Batman's end.

05:50.476 --> 05:52.311
Let's try to anticipate his next crime.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.939
Which no doubt will concern itself
with Aquarius.

05:55.106 --> 05:57.650
The water bearer. But what could that be?

05:57.859 --> 06:00.486
If you take it literally, of course...

06:00.653 --> 06:05.157
...it could mean
the entire Gotham City water system.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.911
But he's tried once before.
And we foiled him, remember?

06:09.120 --> 06:11.330
Yes. With Alfred's help.

06:11.539 --> 06:16.168
But maybe this time he's aiming higher.

06:16.419 --> 06:23.175
Maybe he has some mad scheme for stealing
the entire Gotham City water system.

06:23.384 --> 06:27.555
Stealing the entire
Gotham City's water system?

06:27.722 --> 06:30.641
It's magnificent, Joker.
How are you gonna do it?

06:30.808 --> 06:34.145
Well, if you make something unusable,
it's just as good as stealing it.

06:34.353 --> 06:37.732
Well, if you mean polluting the water,
that didn't work before.

06:37.899 --> 06:42.403
Ah, but this time I have a much more
sophisticated plan in mind.

06:42.612 --> 06:45.948
Joker-Jelly.
Concentrated strawberry gelatin...

06:46.115 --> 06:49.410
...powerful enough to change all the water
into strawberry jelly.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.707
It's very ingenious, Joker.
A crime almost as good as one of mine.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.376
One of yours?

06:57.585 --> 07:00.463
Those piddly escapades? Ha, ha!

07:00.671 --> 07:03.132
"Ha" yourself, you cornball crook.

07:03.341 --> 07:06.886
- Why, you waddling little pip-squeak.
-You gap-toothed goon.

07:07.053 --> 07:08.429
- How dare you?
-Agh!

07:08.596 --> 07:11.223
- Let me at him. You long-nosed fish eater.
-Waugh!

07:11.390 --> 07:13.643
- How dare you say--?
-Huh?

07:13.809 --> 07:15.227
What are we doing?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.480
We should be fighting Batman,
not each other.

07:17.688 --> 07:20.066
You're right. For once.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.402
- What's the caper?
-Well, my Aquarius crime is all set, Pengy.

07:23.569 --> 07:26.781
But I need help with Capricorn,
my twelfth and final crime.

07:26.948 --> 07:29.992
Capricorn, the goat? What is it?

07:30.242 --> 07:31.577
"Who is it?"

07:31.786 --> 07:33.579
- I don't know. Batman?
-Right.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.873
Batman's the goat,
and we're going to get him.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.541
Wonderful, wonderful. How do we do it?

07:37.708 --> 07:42.797
Ah, by using that suave Penguin charm
to captivate a beautiful girl.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.799
Magnificent, magnificent.

07:44.966 --> 07:48.427
- Who is she? Where is she? Where is she?
-She's my former associate, Venus.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.222
And right now she's in Bruce Wayne's
midtown apartment...

07:51.430 --> 07:53.099
...where my satellites traced her...

07:53.307 --> 07:56.310
...by means of a homing device
I concealed in her shoe.

07:56.519 --> 08:01.273
Oh, I'll sweep her off her feet.
I'll charm the stars into her eyes.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.694
Women of America, beware.

08:04.902 --> 08:07.113
Don Juan Penguin is on the loose.

08:23.963 --> 08:28.676
<i>NARRATOR". And so while the Penguin
prepares for his romantic task...</i>

08:30.261 --> 08:33.681
<i>...the joker is busy
at the Gotham City Reservoir.</i>

08:34.640 --> 08:37.351
Oh, this is a delicious spot.

08:42.356 --> 08:46.277
Let the Gotham City-ites try to get this stuff
out of their spigots.

08:46.485 --> 08:47.695
- Yeah.
-Just think, Mars.

08:47.862 --> 08:50.364
You turn on the faucet
and out comes strawberry jelly.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.367
Yeah, that's a great idea.
You know, if you got a sink full of biscuits.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.464
Holy jelly molds.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.300
It looks like strawberry jelly.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.763
But it tastes like strawberry axle grease.

09:14.138 --> 09:18.225
So in his warped way,
Joker has stolen the water supply.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.604
You think this stuff is coming
out of all the faucets in Gotham City?

09:21.812 --> 09:23.355
Knowing Joker, I'd bet on it.

09:23.564 --> 09:27.068
We'll have to use the Batcopter, Robin.
It has the portable Batlab in it.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.737
To the Gotham City Reservoir.

09:42.708 --> 09:46.212
<i>NARRATOR". And while the Dynamic Duo
are rushing to the reservoir...</i>

09:50.716 --> 09:55.096
<i>...Gotham City has gone dry as a bone.</i>

09:55.888 --> 10:00.935
<i>Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the--</i>

10:01.102 --> 10:03.771
Mother machree.

10:09.527 --> 10:14.031
I'll lay odds the Joker's behind this.

10:31.757 --> 10:35.094
We'll try the sulfide reagents first, Robin.

10:36.220 --> 10:40.099
We'd better hit it pretty soon, Batman,
or there'll be a lot of thirsty Gothamites.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.810
Worse than that, Robin,
if a fire should break out...

10:43.018 --> 10:45.729
...the fire department
would have no way of putting it out.

10:45.938 --> 10:49.358
Holy holocaust. I forgot all about that.

10:51.861 --> 10:55.739
That'll be the commissioner trying to get us
on the Batphone in the portable Batlab.

10:55.948 --> 11:00.494
Lucky for us, we had mobile-phone Bat-plugs
installed in our utility belts.

11:03.706 --> 11:05.958
- Yes, commissioner.
-Where are you, Batman?

11:06.167 --> 11:07.668
<i>At the reservoir, commissioner.</i>

11:07.877 --> 11:10.129
So that's how he did it.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.674
Well, we've got more than just that mess
on our hands.

11:13.883 --> 11:19.263
The Joker sent word to me that he wants
$10 million to de-gelatinize the water supply.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.140
<i>Don't pay it, commissioner.</i>

11:21.515 --> 11:23.601
The Joker's used a very complex formula.

11:23.809 --> 11:28.105
It'll take time to analyze it, but we will.
Don't you worry about that.

11:28.314 --> 11:31.984
That's what I wanted to hear, Batman.

11:32.151 --> 11:35.487
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile,
in Bruce Wayne's midtown apartment...</i>

11:35.654 --> 11:40.242
<i>...a lonely Venus receives gifts
from an ardent admirer.</i>

11:42.077 --> 11:45.706
-It's so sweet of Batman to send me flowers.
-Batman?

11:45.873 --> 11:49.043
Those are no flowers
from a bat-eared buffoon.

11:49.251 --> 11:53.255
Those are from a mature admirer.
Your suitor. Mm!

11:53.464 --> 11:57.468
Oh, you ravishing rose of womanhood.
Waugh, waugh.

11:57.635 --> 12:01.430
- Oh, Penguin. Oh, uh--
-Mm.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.682
I'm going straight now.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.310
So whatever you want, it's no go.

12:06.477 --> 12:08.062
What? I want absolutely nothing...

12:08.229 --> 12:12.358
...except to pay tribute to your beauty
and your charm and your gaiety and your wit.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.237
And to that end I have brought you
another little token of my admiration.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.446
Token!

12:17.613 --> 12:22.868
This is a bit of Surplice Number Six,
my little tulip. Ha-ha-ha.

12:23.077 --> 12:26.205
Oh, this is the most expensive perfume
in the whole world.

12:26.372 --> 12:27.456
That's right.

12:27.665 --> 12:29.792
It costs $1000 an ounce.

12:29.959 --> 12:33.754
Tut-tut, that is nothing, my little daffodil.
Now put it down and sit on the sofa.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.090
Shall we, my fragile orchid, huh?

12:36.298 --> 12:39.260
Oh, you're beautiful.
You're beautiful, beautiful.

12:39.468 --> 12:40.511
Drapes.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.685
Oh, heh. Pengy, it's dark.

12:47.893 --> 12:50.479
We'll remedy that, my glorious gardenia.

12:50.688 --> 12:52.856
Candles. Bring me candles.

12:53.065 --> 12:56.485
I, uh, think I'd rather have the drapes open,
Pengy.

12:56.652 --> 12:59.947
What? When candlelight does so much
for your eyes? No.

13:00.155 --> 13:05.244
Tell me, my heavenly hyacinth,
when is the last time you had a good, uh...

13:05.494 --> 13:06.954
...drink of water?

13:07.121 --> 13:08.580
Drink of water?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.541
Oh, you can't get any water.

13:10.708 --> 13:14.962
Nothing comes out of the faucets
but strawberry jelly.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.464
I guess that's how rich millionaires live.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.550
And you're probably thirsty, eh?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.593
Champagne.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.638
You'll have some champagne,
my little buttercup, won't you?

13:24.805 --> 13:26.598
You'll have some champagne, huh?

13:26.765 --> 13:29.643
I really don't think that I should, Pengy.

13:29.852 --> 13:33.314
Why? You want to die of dehydrophalia?

13:33.522 --> 13:37.026
- What's that?
-Well, that's the loss of precious bodily fluids...

13:37.234 --> 13:39.903
...due to a lack of liquid in the tissues.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.324
- It sounds terrible.
-Drink up, my dear. Drink up.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.075
Waugh, Waugh, waugh.

13:45.242 --> 13:47.077
Some here. Some here.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.872
Waugh! Drink it up, my dear.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.041
Save yourself from sin.

13:56.086 --> 13:59.173
That's it, Robin.
Now hand me the special exploding Batarang.

13:59.381 --> 14:00.716
Right here, Batman.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.678
We'll pour the de-gelatinizing agent...

14:04.887 --> 14:08.640
...into the special exploding Batarang...

14:10.642 --> 14:15.981
...set the timing fuse for three seconds...

14:16.190 --> 14:18.525
...and...

14:24.865 --> 14:26.241
That did it, Batman.

14:28.118 --> 14:33.123
Before I met you, my sprig of mint,
I thought of nothing but crime.

14:33.332 --> 14:35.876
Now I want to turn over a new leaf.

14:36.085 --> 14:37.795
But there's one little problem.

14:38.003 --> 14:42.132
- What?
-My criminal record locked in the Batcave.

14:42.341 --> 14:46.512
And until that is destroyed,
I can never feel like an honest man.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.097
Why don't you ask Batman to--?

14:48.305 --> 14:50.766
Batman?
He'd never believe that I've gone straight.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.812
No, only you have faith in me,
my alluring azalea.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.398
Only you can wipe out my past.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.525
Help me start anew.

14:59.733 --> 15:03.612
- But I can't get into the Batcave.
-Of course you can.

15:03.821 --> 15:08.242
You ask Batman to take you there,
my lovely lady slipper.

15:08.409 --> 15:11.662
And then you slip out my card
from the Batcomputer...

15:11.870 --> 15:13.914
...and I'll be able to start new.

15:15.541 --> 15:19.169
My head's spinning from the champagne.

15:19.461 --> 15:22.881
I wish I knew whether
to believe you or not, Pengy.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.467
Believe me, my sweet honeysuckle.

15:25.676 --> 15:27.553
I speak from the heart.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.893
I know it's a big thing to ask, Batman...

15:35.102 --> 15:39.481
...but I've always dreamed
of seeing the Batcave and...

15:41.442 --> 15:43.152
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:43.360 --> 15:49.616
After all, I guess there is really no reason
you should trust me...

15:49.950 --> 15:54.204
...when I was on the other side
not very long ago.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.165
I trust you, Venus.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.125
Then you'll take me?

15:58.584 --> 16:00.669
All right, Venus.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.421
We'll show you the Batcave.

16:03.088 --> 16:07.301
Your decision to lead an honest life
was difficult and dangerous.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.803
Consider this your reward.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.805
Oh, Batman.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.318
I'll have to give you a whiff of Bat-gas
before we leave, Venus.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.569
Bat-gas?

16:25.736 --> 16:29.823
Yes. We can permit you see the inside
of the Batcave, but not the outside.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.701
We can't let you or anyone else
know it's location.

16:32.868 --> 16:35.871
Then when you're in the Batcave,
we'll give you an another whiff.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.081
Bat-awake. Completely harmless.

16:38.290 --> 16:40.959
Whatever you say, Batman.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.286
Oh!

17:17.329 --> 17:19.957
It's fabulous.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.710
It's a place to hang our cowls.

17:25.796 --> 17:29.174
- Well, what's that thing over there?
-That's the Batcomputer.

17:29.383 --> 17:33.136
And over here
is the Bat-spectrograph Criminal Analyzer.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.890
And that is our Bat-radar.

17:37.432 --> 17:39.309
And over here is the Penguin.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.313
And over here is the Joker. Ha-ha-ha!

17:43.480 --> 17:48.569
Plus, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter,
Neptune, Uranus and Saturn.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.988
Penguin, you lied to me.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.490
Not a bit. I will feel like a new man...

17:53.699 --> 17:56.702
...with Batman and Robin
squashed like beetles.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.412
Ha-ha-ha!
- Why, you--

17:58.620 --> 18:00.581
Stay where you are, unpleasant adolescent.

18:00.789 --> 18:04.251
One pull of this trigger
and this deadly umbrella gun...

18:04.459 --> 18:06.003
...will fry you to a fritter.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.255
It's all my fault, Batman.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.216
I thought I was helping Penguin reform.

18:11.425 --> 18:13.760
Oh, how could I have been so stupid?

18:13.969 --> 18:16.597
He's fooled much shrewder people than you,
Venus.

18:16.805 --> 18:19.850
But the results are superb, Venus, my flower.

18:20.058 --> 18:23.979
With the Dynamic Duo destroyed,
the Batcave will be converted...

18:24.187 --> 18:27.399
...into the headquarters
for the criminals of Gotham City.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.569
Just think of it, Joker.

18:31.028 --> 18:34.114
Never again will we be bothered
by any all this Bat paraphernalia.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.659
Yes, I'm thinking of it,
Pengy. I'm thinking of it.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.078
Lives of uninterrupted crime.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.295
What was that?

18:48.754 --> 18:52.799
Merely the Bat-spectrograph Criminal Analyzer,
Penguin.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.218
Completed just this week.

18:55.427 --> 18:58.805
In that brief second,
it recorded your bone structure...

18:59.014 --> 19:02.976
...metabolism rate, molecular blood structure,
retina patterns...

19:03.185 --> 19:08.440
...and other scientific data
that may prove invaluable in the future.

19:08.649 --> 19:14.071
But it only works at close range,
and is much too large to move.

19:14.279 --> 19:19.785
So I had to bring you both in here
in order to utilize it.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.620
You knew they were in the trunk?

19:22.037 --> 19:25.582
No crime fighter worth his salt
wouldn't have known, Venus.

19:25.791 --> 19:30.962
Well, your Bat-spectro junk heap isn't gonna
do you any good where you're going, Batman.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.881
Let them have it, Pengy.

19:38.178 --> 19:40.263
It doesn't work.

19:41.390 --> 19:43.058
No, it doesn't work, Penguin.

19:43.266 --> 19:46.520
The negative ion attractor
which I placed in the trunk...

19:46.728 --> 19:48.355
...depleted its power source...

19:48.563 --> 19:51.191
...during the time you were inside.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.861
- Shall we, Robin?
-Let's, Batman.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.155
Waugh!

20:57.507 --> 20:58.550
Aah!

21:08.018 --> 21:09.561
Aah!

21:09.770 --> 21:11.730
Waugh! Waugh, waugh, waugh.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.823
You caught us, Batman.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.494
But your crime-fighting days are over,
because we've seen the Batcave.

21:25.911 --> 21:28.997
The inside, not the outside, Joker.

21:29.206 --> 21:30.207
So what?

21:30.373 --> 21:33.293
So we don't know where the Batcave is,
you backward eel.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.755
Well, why didn't you think of taking a look
on the outside, you dolt?

21:36.922 --> 21:38.048
Why, you cornball crook.

21:38.215 --> 21:40.842
- Why, you whiny little pip-squeak.
-You crazy totem pole.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.219
Why, you long-nosed--

21:42.594 --> 21:45.639
- You knew what Batman would--
Enough. Enough. Enough.

21:45.847 --> 21:47.098
Enough, gentlemen.

21:47.307 --> 21:53.271
I think a little whiff of Bat-gas
should calm you down nicely.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.440
Just breathe normally.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.986
Waugh, Waugh, waugh...

22:02.739 --> 22:04.282
Holy gambles, Batman.

22:04.491 --> 22:06.868
What if they had opened the trunk
on the way here?

22:07.077 --> 22:08.453
They couldn't have, Robin.

22:08.662 --> 22:13.625
I have the Emergency Bat-trunk Lock on
during the trip.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.711
Oh, Batman.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.464
I don't know what to say.

22:19.673 --> 22:22.050
Well, don't say anything, Venus.

22:22.259 --> 22:26.221
After all, you did help us catch Joker.

22:26.429 --> 22:31.560
His scheme to use you
turned out to be a trap for himself...

22:31.768 --> 22:33.353
...and Penguin.

22:33.562 --> 22:35.605
And his slithery stooges.

22:46.324 --> 22:50.954
Listen, Bruce.
Your horoscope for tomorrow.

22:51.496 --> 22:54.416
"Prospects most favorable.

22:54.624 --> 22:57.294
The positions of Mercury and Mars...

22:57.502 --> 23:00.338
...which might have been threatening,
have changed.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.341
And Venus is in the ascendancy."

23:03.550 --> 23:05.343
Oh, my, isn't that nice?

23:05.719 --> 23:07.762
That's very nice, Aunt Harriet.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.806
And here's yours, Dick.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.892
"A very pleasant day.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.895
Satellites no longer pose a threat.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.480
Fun in store with family."

23:17.689 --> 23:19.524
Oh, I'm just so glad.

23:19.733 --> 23:23.445
With all the strange things
that have been happening recently.

23:23.653 --> 23:26.907
I thought we'd been leading
well-ordered lives, Aunt Harriet.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.492
Oh, I mean all over Gotham City.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.746
All that icky goo in the water supply...

23:32.954 --> 23:36.625
...and the terrible time
Batman and Robin have been having.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.793
Don't listen to idle rumor, Aunt Harriet.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.962
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

23:41.171 --> 23:42.756
But someone told me...

23:42.964 --> 23:46.843
...that both the Joker and the Penguin
were after Batman...

23:47.052 --> 23:51.556
...and Robin almost got eaten alive
by a giant clam.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.351
How could one little clam eat a boy his size?

23:54.726 --> 23:57.604
It does sound a little farfetched, doesn't it?

23:57.812 --> 23:59.189
Dinner is served.

23:59.397 --> 24:01.232
About time, Alfred. What are we having?

24:01.441 --> 24:03.443
We begin with your favorite, Master Dick.

24:03.652 --> 24:04.986
Clam chowder.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.738
Clam chowder?

24:06.947 --> 24:10.283
Isn't that a coincidence.

24:16.373 --> 24:17.832
Chin up, old churn.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.543
It's one way of getting even.
