<i>El Gato!</i>

00:32.107 --> 00:34.831
<b>2x08- "Stories"</b>

00:44.841 --> 00:48.678
Oh, Herr Puss, I am so
excited for our treasure quest!

00:48.762 --> 00:51.598
Look how my hooves quiver
with anticipation!

00:52.933 --> 00:54.393
Yes, my hoofed friend,

00:54.477 --> 00:57.354
the promise of adventure
awakens my soul as well,

00:57.438 --> 00:59.648
but this is serious business.

00:59.731 --> 01:02.818
San Lorenzans! We have a lot
of treasure to find

01:02.901 --> 01:05.488
if we want to restore
the town's protective spell.

01:05.612 --> 01:07.406
And we must do so quickly,

01:07.490 --> 01:11.494
before the disaster Sino has prophesied
will come with the eclipse.

01:11.576 --> 01:12.786
It will not be easy,

01:12.869 --> 01:16.123
but armed thusly with this list
of our missing treasure

01:16.206 --> 01:19.001
and the Mystic Silver Dowsing Rod
of Akhenaten,

01:19.084 --> 01:21.044
success will be ours!

01:21.128 --> 01:22.671
So let us do this thing.

01:22.754 --> 01:24.507
For San Lorenzo!

01:24.589 --> 01:26.258
Hooray!

01:28.511 --> 01:31.221
I can't wait to go on our adventure, Puss.

01:31.305 --> 01:33.890
Also, could you explain that
all over again

01:33.974 --> 01:35.767
slower and with smaller words?

01:35.851 --> 01:38.187
As I have told you repeatedly,

01:38.270 --> 01:40.814
the adults are going to find treasure.

01:42.107 --> 01:44.234
Could you use the word "adult"
in a sentence?

01:45.819 --> 01:47.696
Señora Zapata is an adult.

01:47.779 --> 01:50.366
I saw Señora Zapata kissing a thief.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.370
Kids, right?

01:54.453 --> 01:56.830
You saw nothing.

01:56.913 --> 01:58.582
I do not have time for this now.

01:58.665 --> 02:01.502
If you will excuse me,
I have a grand adventure to lead.

02:01.585 --> 02:05.130
And we're gonna help!
- No, you will be staying here.

02:05.214 --> 02:06.507
<i>Aw.</i>

02:06.590 --> 02:08.425
Puss, where should I pack the crossbow?

02:08.508 --> 02:12.221
Put it with the other very exciting
weapons for our amazing adventure.

02:12.304 --> 02:15.765
Puss, Puss, wait. Puh-lease, can we come?

02:16.559 --> 02:20.187
Toby, we all have our roles to play
in the story of life,

02:20.270 --> 02:21.271
and sometimes...

02:21.355 --> 02:25.150
Our role is to be the best helpers
on an amazing adventure?

02:25.234 --> 02:29.821
Sometimes, our role is to be
the pig who helps by not helping.

02:29.905 --> 02:31.740
That doesn't really make sense.

02:31.823 --> 02:35.118
I know! I'm just so giddy
about our super exciting trip!

02:35.202 --> 02:38.539
Forget it, Toby. We're too young to help.

02:38.622 --> 02:41.708
Yes, that's it exactly.
Tick tock, Herr Puss.

02:41.791 --> 02:44.336
We are burning daylight mit the chit-chat.

02:46.213 --> 02:47.047
Uli?

02:47.130 --> 02:49.466
Nein! I much prefer to walk.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.260
It invigorates the muscles.

02:51.343 --> 02:52.469
As you wish.

02:52.553 --> 02:56.139
Children, Artephius will babysit you,
so listen well to him.

02:56.223 --> 03:00.102
And no matter what, let no one near
the Treasure House.

03:00.185 --> 03:01.437
Hyah!

03:01.520 --> 03:03.980
<i>Bye!
- Bye-bye. Take care!</i>

03:04.648 --> 03:06.567
<i>I'm gonna have the time of my life!</i>

03:06.650 --> 03:08.277
<i>Leave those orphans behind!</i>

03:08.360 --> 03:09.736
That's rude!

03:13.865 --> 03:17.244
Artephius the babysitter!
Who would have thought?

03:17.327 --> 03:20.372
Now, which one of you little gentlemen
is Artephius?

03:23.750 --> 03:27.003
I'm too bored to even move.

03:27.087 --> 03:30.715
This is the most boring thing
to ever happen to anyone,

03:30.799 --> 03:32.717
anywhere, ever.

03:32.801 --> 03:36.888
It's even worse than
the Curse of the Goblin King.

03:36.972 --> 03:39.808
The Curse of the Goblin King? What's that?

03:39.891 --> 03:42.769
Well, when the Goblin King curses you,

03:42.852 --> 03:46.315
you're doomed to repeat the same thing
again and again,

03:46.398 --> 03:48.692
and again and again,
and again...

03:48.775 --> 03:49.734
Oh, we get it.
- ...and again.

03:49.859 --> 03:50.944
Forever!

03:51.528 --> 03:52.779
Whoa.

03:52.862 --> 03:55.824
And the worst part is
you don't even remember.

03:55.907 --> 04:00.287
You just do the same thing over and over,
like a gazillion times.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.957
If someone cursed me
to eat the same pickle a gazillion times,

04:04.040 --> 04:05.459
I'd call 'em a pal.

04:06.835 --> 04:10.380
Sooo boooooored.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.008
Hmm.

05:37.842 --> 05:40.136
I've never done so much nothing.

05:41.597 --> 05:44.182
<i>I feel like I'm losing my mind.</i>

05:45.434 --> 05:48.228
Welcome to my world.

06:08.331 --> 06:10.667
Hmm. My scepter must be here.

06:10.793 --> 06:11.627
I...

06:15.422 --> 06:18.634
In the name of the Junior Puss Squad,
halt right...

06:20.677 --> 06:22.679
Oh, wow.

06:25.974 --> 06:27.016
What is this?

06:27.100 --> 06:28.977
Baby animals and...

06:29.102 --> 06:30.103
Whoa-oo-ah!

06:30.186 --> 06:31.647
...pickle children?

06:34.316 --> 06:37.026
Now, now, Gustopher...

06:37.110 --> 06:39.321
Ooh, that tickles.

06:39.988 --> 06:42.282
Who is this? Your babysitter?

06:42.949 --> 06:43.908
Yes.

06:43.992 --> 06:45.869
Ha!

06:45.994 --> 06:46.829
He is asleep.

06:46.911 --> 06:48.622
He sits babies poorly.

06:48.705 --> 06:50.582
If you think I'm not here to fight,

06:50.666 --> 06:54.085
then you don't know Taranis,
God of Thunder!

06:54.169 --> 06:57.922
Because,
Taranis, God of Thunder is me!

06:58.006 --> 06:59.883
And me is here to do one thing.

06:59.966 --> 07:03.887
Fight anyone who stands in the way
of the one thing I'm here to do.

07:03.970 --> 07:07.599
Get the Scepter of Lightning!

07:07.683 --> 07:12.103
Did you know that the first wheels
were flat and people called them sticks?

07:12.187 --> 07:13.814
History is fun.

07:15.899 --> 07:17.108
I did not know that.

07:17.192 --> 07:18.777
This is very interesting.

07:18.985 --> 07:22.572
You know what else will be history
if I do not get my scepter?

07:22.656 --> 07:23.782
This town!

07:23.866 --> 07:26.869
Could you use the word "scepter"
in a sentence?

07:28.411 --> 07:31.665
My scepter is a staff
made of frozen lightning

07:31.748 --> 07:35.460
and it is somewhere in this town, so...
so am I! Boom!

07:38.588 --> 07:40.632
Huh?

07:43.301 --> 07:48.306
Pally, we ain't seen anything
like any scepters in San Lorenzo.

07:49.683 --> 07:51.685
Oh, then I guess I was mistaken.

07:52.853 --> 07:54.062
I will be on my way.

07:54.855 --> 07:56.105
That was close.

07:56.189 --> 07:57.023
Unless...

07:57.607 --> 07:58.441
Uh-oh.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.528
Unless maybe your scepter
is in the Treasure House.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.157
What?

08:07.367 --> 08:08.535
Oh.

08:08.660 --> 08:10.245
Wha... What're we gonna do?

08:10.328 --> 08:12.956
Puss told us not to let anyone
near the Treasure House,

08:13.039 --> 08:15.625
and that's the opposite
of what's happening.

08:18.127 --> 08:21.840
Hey, meat bag!
You better not take one more step.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.218
Uh.

08:26.344 --> 08:28.346
I demand to know why not.

08:28.430 --> 08:33.101
Because did you know that San Lorenzo
is protected by Puss in Boots?

08:35.061 --> 08:36.897
Who is this Puss in Boots?

08:36.980 --> 08:39.232
Does he have a mighty wheel?

08:46.364 --> 08:47.991
I don't know about wheels,

08:48.074 --> 08:52.120
but did you know that Puss in Boots
is the greatest hero of all time?

08:52.203 --> 08:54.873
Hmm. This intrigues me.

08:54.957 --> 08:57.542
Tell me more, young gangly mortal.

08:57.626 --> 08:59.878
I'll tell you about Puss in Boots.

09:01.713 --> 09:04.048
<i>He is a cat!</i>

09:04.132 --> 09:05.508
With boots!

09:05.592 --> 09:06.760
And a hat!

09:06.885 --> 09:09.387
And a sword for sword fighting!

09:11.389 --> 09:15.602
And did you know that one time,
there was this bad guy, El Moco?

09:24.611 --> 09:28.991
Did you know that my sword is so heavy
it takes three men to lift it?

09:31.159 --> 09:32.869
Four, by our count.

09:34.245 --> 09:35.705
I am hungry here.

09:35.789 --> 09:37.457
Do you want us to fix you a snack?

09:37.540 --> 09:39.334
Yes. Wait.

09:39.417 --> 09:40.376
No.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.629
Let us rob the town of its gold,

09:42.712 --> 09:46.967
and then use the money
to buy artisanal meats and cheeses.

09:47.050 --> 09:49.052
<i>Yay! Cheese!</i>

09:50.386 --> 09:52.388
<i>Not so fast, El Moco!</i>

09:53.139 --> 09:55.767
Did you know that I am
the greatest hero ever?

09:59.021 --> 10:01.481
Did you know that we are going to fight?

10:02.398 --> 10:03.608
<i>Attack!</i>

10:11.574 --> 10:15.996
Did you know that you punched up
all my thieves but you didn't punch me?

10:16.079 --> 10:18.581
And follow-up question,
did you know that...

10:18.665 --> 10:19.791
Sword!

10:20.249 --> 10:23.027
<i>And did you know
at this part of the story</i>

10:23.028 --> 10:24.880
<i>it looks like Puss is beaten?</i>

10:24.963 --> 10:28.550
Well, well, Puss,
it looks like you are beaten.

10:28.675 --> 10:31.553
<i>You forgot one
very important thing, El Moco.</i>

10:34.514 --> 10:37.141
Sword!

10:39.435 --> 10:41.855
<i>Did you know
that the sun is very hot?</i>

10:46.651 --> 10:50.488
Did you know that was very good?
- Good for you! Yeah-ha-ha!

10:55.869 --> 10:57.913
This Puss in Boots is very strong.

10:58.038 --> 11:01.374
Ooh, if you like that story,
wait till you hear this one!

11:01.457 --> 11:05.336
One day my owl Gustopher
was sitting on my weather vane.

11:09.298 --> 11:10.341
True story.

11:11.551 --> 11:13.720
Those stories were impressive.

11:13.803 --> 11:17.849
Not so much the one about the owl.
More the one about the warrior in boots!

11:17.933 --> 11:21.227
Yeah, as cookies go, he's the toughest.

11:21.895 --> 11:25.607
Well, lucky for me this Puss in Boots
is not here to stop me

11:25.690 --> 11:28.777
from tearing this town apart
until I find my scepter!

11:28.860 --> 11:31.237
Which is what I want. Now!

11:33.907 --> 11:34.950
Hello!

11:35.033 --> 11:38.286
Gustopher was just sitting
on a weather vane.

11:38.369 --> 11:39.788
Sitty-sitty-sit.

11:40.038 --> 11:41.748
Ah, he was such a good boy,

11:41.831 --> 11:44.584
he never gave anybody any trouble.
He'd just sit there...

11:44.667 --> 11:46.044
<i>Are you there, scepter?</i>

11:46.128 --> 11:49.547
I do not know why I ask because
you do not speak or anything.

11:49.631 --> 11:50.799
Wait.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.886
Huh?
- Why does the pig say to wait?

11:57.764 --> 12:00.475
So, you know how me and Puss
are best friends?

12:00.558 --> 12:03.603
I will take your word for it.
- We totally are!

12:03.728 --> 12:07.398
And this one time we went
to out-riddle the Sphinx.

12:17.993 --> 12:21.037
Wow, are you guys, like,
twins or whatever?

12:21.621 --> 12:24.791
I can see where you would think that.
- We heard you like riddles!

12:25.625 --> 12:28.795
Yeah, that's kinda my whole deal.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.881
In that case,
we have a doozy of a riddle for you.

12:31.965 --> 12:33.925
Tell her the doozy, my best friend amigo.

12:34.009 --> 12:35.384
I will, best friend.

12:35.468 --> 12:37.137
Okay.

12:37.220 --> 12:40.431
What has eight legs
and four of them are hooves

12:40.515 --> 12:42.433
and it smiles all the time

12:42.517 --> 12:46.062
and one of them has boots
and the other one is a pig?

12:49.482 --> 12:50.942
<i>Friendship!</i>

12:53.236 --> 12:55.279
Uh, you guys beat me.

12:57.573 --> 13:01.619
Puss, if you could have anything to eat
right now, what would it be?

13:02.328 --> 13:03.663
<i>Fried chicken!</i>

13:06.833 --> 13:09.794
Wheeee!

13:14.465 --> 13:17.177
<i>Toby, this is
supposed to be a story</i>

13:17.260 --> 13:20.429
<i>about what's more powerful
than a magical wheel.</i>

13:20.555 --> 13:21.848
I'm getting to it!

13:22.598 --> 13:25.977
Then, the Duchess came
to steal Puss away from me.

13:26.061 --> 13:29.147
Puss in Boots is best friends ever
with that pig.

13:29.231 --> 13:32.441
But I want Puss for my best friend!

13:35.570 --> 13:38.073
<i>Best friends super high-five!</i>

13:54.964 --> 13:58.238
<i>Best friendship
won the day and the mayor</i>

13:58.239 --> 14:01.512
<i>gave us a trophy and, oh,
yeah, there were fireworks.</i>

14:02.513 --> 14:04.933
<i>Oh, beautiful.</i>

14:05.100 --> 14:07.060
That story did not scare me.

14:07.143 --> 14:10.354
However, I am envious
of your epic friendship.

14:10.438 --> 14:12.523
I value that sort of thing.

14:12.607 --> 14:16.319
But not as much as I value my scepter!

14:16.402 --> 14:17.737
Which I demand!

14:19.114 --> 14:21.950
The point of the story is... uh...

14:22.075 --> 14:23.451
we're Puss's friends.

14:23.534 --> 14:27.622
And if you mess with Puss's friends,
then Puss messes with you.

14:27.705 --> 14:31.834
It's a stretch. And the pig's story
definitely didn't prove his friend

14:31.918 --> 14:33.836
more mighty than I am!

14:33.920 --> 14:36.631
Ooh. Want a story about my best friend?

14:36.714 --> 14:39.467
If it's windy outside,
Gustopher will tell you.

14:39.592 --> 14:42.637
How's that for an epic story, huh?

14:42.720 --> 14:43.554
Eh?

14:44.139 --> 14:47.391
I don't think you understand
what a story is, gray-hair.

14:47.475 --> 14:50.228
But if it's wind you want,
I'll show you wind.

14:50.312 --> 14:52.230
Wind that will destroy this town

14:52.314 --> 14:54.649
if I don't get my scepter!

14:55.524 --> 14:57.110
I am master of storms!

14:57.193 --> 15:01.197
Where I go, storms follow me
like a blowy shadow made of weather!

15:06.119 --> 15:09.331
You think Puss in Boots
is scared of a stiff breeze?

15:09.413 --> 15:12.792
You can keep your wind and go fly a kite.

15:12.875 --> 15:16.504
You think you have insulted me,
but I am very good with kites.

15:16.587 --> 15:19.382
Some have called me an expert kitesman!

15:19.465 --> 15:20.466
Kites are pretty.

15:20.591 --> 15:23.136
No! My kites are manly!

15:23.219 --> 15:25.096
They are made of meat and fur!

15:25.180 --> 15:26.014
Ew.

15:26.097 --> 15:27.223
Says you.

15:27.307 --> 15:32.228
Now lemme tell you the other stuff Puss
is gonna do to grind you into oatmeal.

15:32.312 --> 15:35.690
I wanna tell it!
- We can tell it together, kid.

15:35.773 --> 15:37.108
I refuse to listen.

15:37.192 --> 15:39.986
Your stories do nothing
but anger my insides.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.696
Hush up, muscles.

15:41.779 --> 15:43.990
You're gonna wanna hear this one.

15:45.449 --> 15:46.951
<i>Puss is so fast,</i>

15:47.035 --> 15:49.329
<i>you won't see him coming
at you until it's too late.</i>

15:49.453 --> 15:51.664
<i>And he has magic fairy wings!</i>

15:51.747 --> 15:55.168
<i>Huh? Hmm.
Mmm? Hmm.</i>

16:00.548 --> 16:03.051
<i>And fairy breath!
- Fairy breath?</i>

16:09.473 --> 16:11.017
<i>Sparkles!</i>

16:19.817 --> 16:22.695
I didn't know Puss had
fairy wings. I wish I did.

16:22.778 --> 16:26.032
I do not care about this cat
or his wings or shoes or...

16:26.115 --> 16:27.700
Puss in Boots.
- Whatever!

16:27.783 --> 16:32.914
I care about one thing and one thing only,
and that is retrieving my scepter.

16:32.997 --> 16:36.376
The punishment for me
not finding my scepter will be me

16:36.459 --> 16:38.961
destroying everything in this town!

16:39.045 --> 16:41.589
Which includes all of you!

16:41.672 --> 16:45.676
Uh, that's just the tip of the iceberg
when it comes to what Puss can do.

16:46.635 --> 16:50.014
<i>Once, Puss had to face
all the bad guys from his past.</i>

16:50.598 --> 16:52.683
<i>But was this a problem?</i>

17:01.401 --> 17:04.569
<i>Oh, my gosh, I love you
so much, I just wanna kill you!</i>

17:12.454 --> 17:14.663
I have a magic sword!

17:15.248 --> 17:17.665
<i>Nope.
Not for Puss in Boots.</i>

17:29.887 --> 17:32.265
<i>Then he finished off
the poor sap with...</i>

17:32.348 --> 17:33.849
<i>Nose fire!</i>

17:35.268 --> 17:36.727
But that doesn't make any...

17:41.649 --> 17:42.984
sense.

17:44.777 --> 17:47.322
<i>I saw Se?ora
Zapata kissing a thief.</i>

17:48.156 --> 17:49.824
Mmmm...

17:50.992 --> 17:54.370
I do not want to hear any more
about this Puss in Boots!

17:54.454 --> 17:57.623
I want my Scepter of Lightning!

17:58.500 --> 18:01.461
It is a scepter that controls lightning!

18:01.544 --> 18:03.838
So it is aptly named!
- Yeah, but Puss...

18:03.921 --> 18:08.426
I understand. He has many fine talents.
But is he a god?

18:18.353 --> 18:21.230
It's certainly gotten windy today!

18:21.314 --> 18:23.566
<i>Whoa!</i>

18:23.941 --> 18:27.987
If you think this is something,
wait until I get my scepter back.

18:28.070 --> 18:30.865
What world will I destroy? This one.

18:32.825 --> 18:34.577
What are we going to do?

18:35.286 --> 18:38.373
Now if you will excuse me,
and even if you will not,

18:38.456 --> 18:42.377
I intend to take my scepter back,
beginning now!

18:43.961 --> 18:47.340
He's gonna get into the Treasure House.
We gotta stop him!

18:48.216 --> 18:52.303
Did you know we can't just keep
telling him stories again and again?

18:52.803 --> 18:54.138
Hmm.

18:55.014 --> 18:56.974
Again and again.

18:57.058 --> 18:57.933
Hmm.

18:58.017 --> 19:01.563
Cleevil, is that your
"I have an idea" face?

19:01.645 --> 19:03.189
I got an idea!

19:03.939 --> 19:06.359
This clown believes
everything we tell him, right?

19:06.442 --> 19:07.818
You bet I do.

19:07.902 --> 19:11.406
Then he'll believe the Curse
of the Goblin King!

19:14.492 --> 19:15.784
<i>Hey! Listen up!</i>

19:15.868 --> 19:18.413
No more stories of Puss in Boots.

19:18.496 --> 19:20.582
He cannot possibly defeat me!

19:26.421 --> 19:29.673
He sure can. In fact, he already has.

19:31.008 --> 19:32.260
I do not...

19:32.385 --> 19:33.469
What do you...

19:33.553 --> 19:36.222
Explain your words to me
using different ones!

19:36.305 --> 19:39.225
Puss in Boots has already defeated you.

19:39.350 --> 19:44.647
A hundred times.
Nay, a thousand!

19:47.275 --> 19:48.651
<i>You are under a curse!</i>

19:49.235 --> 19:53.822
<i>Doomed to fight Puss over and over
and lose every time!</i>

19:53.948 --> 19:56.117
<i>Again and again!</i>

19:56.200 --> 19:57.660
<i>Ow, ow, ow!</i>

19:57.743 --> 19:58.994
Whoa!

19:59.954 --> 20:04.584
A curse?!
- Yeah! You were cursed by...

20:08.337 --> 20:10.172
Uh, what god are you scared of?

20:10.298 --> 20:13.092
Not Toutatis the All-Father.

20:13.175 --> 20:15.844
Toutatis the All-Father!

20:18.055 --> 20:20.808
<i>Puss has kicked
your butt so many times.</i>

20:21.559 --> 20:23.894
<i>Over easy, sunny side up,</i>

20:23.978 --> 20:26.814
<i>and with home fried potatoes on the side.</i>

20:28.566 --> 20:30.693
No! I fear potatoes!

20:30.776 --> 20:32.612
And the worst part of the curse is...

20:34.363 --> 20:36.699
<i>...you never remember!</i>

20:36.782 --> 20:40.202
<i>You keep coming back for more.</i>

20:47.376 --> 20:48.794
Ahh! Ooh!

20:48.877 --> 20:49.878
Grrrr!

20:49.962 --> 20:51.005
Ahh!

20:51.088 --> 20:52.881
Ugh. Leave me alone!

20:52.965 --> 20:56.605
No! No! No!

20:58.721 --> 21:00.806
The only way to break the curse...

21:02.099 --> 21:03.892
Yes. Tell me! What is it?

21:04.477 --> 21:09.023
...is to never fight Puss again!
- Ah! Anything!

21:09.106 --> 21:11.526
<i>Puss in Boots has returned!</i>

21:17.072 --> 21:19.074
Umm. Hello?

21:19.200 --> 21:21.827
Stay away. I don't want to
fight you anymore.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.622
I don't want my Scepter of Lightning.
I just want the curse to end!

21:24.706 --> 21:26.915
I want to wake up from this nightmare!

21:26.999 --> 21:30.002
<i>Do not burn me
with your terrible nose fire!</i>

21:39.803 --> 21:42.480
Do I want to know
what that was about?

21:42.481 --> 21:45.939
It was all about stories,
Puss! Like I have a story

21:45.940 --> 21:49.397
about this one time Gustopher
fell off my weather vane.

21:49.772 --> 21:53.484
Fell right down, right off my
weather vane. You know, the weather

21:53.485 --> 21:57.196
vane I made out of that
old Scepter of Lightning I found?

21:57.279 --> 21:59.990
This is a thing you could have
mentioned earlier.

22:07.115 --> 22:08.750
Okay.

22:08.950 --> 22:11.711
So, good news, children
and one old person!

22:11.794 --> 22:14.922
We have found all but one
of the missing items!

22:17.841 --> 22:21.220
<i>We are very good at
treasure-finding. I found a cup!</i>

22:21.303 --> 22:23.305
Now, tell me what happened
while we were away.

22:24.056 --> 22:27.184
Your eyes, they look wild with adventure.

22:27.268 --> 22:31.272
Puss in Boots, old buddy,
let us tell you a story.
