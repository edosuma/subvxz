knowing that Gordon...

48:49.960 --> 48:51.849
Am I to understand
that you built that?

48:52.160 --> 48:53.685
Yes!

48:59.200 --> 49:00.531
I apologize.

49:01.360 --> 49:04.045
I misjudged you.

49:04.520 --> 49:06.045
Your flaws,
though they're...

49:06.680 --> 49:09.411
...glaring and massive,
are merely social...

49:09.880 --> 49:11.211
...not intellectual.

49:12.520 --> 49:14.363
I find your work
astonishing...

49:15.360 --> 49:17.203
...and to be
perfectly frank...

49:17.920 --> 49:20.082
...brilliant. Brilliant!

49:20.720 --> 49:24.042
Quite beyond my own
ability to comprehend.

49:26.720 --> 49:27.721
Could you create
another one?

49:27.800 --> 49:31.122
I could, and a whole
lot more beside.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.042
But that would take
considerable resource.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.321
As you are aware,

49:37.400 --> 49:39.562
I do come from the third
richest family in England.

49:39.720 --> 49:41.449
As a result, I can provide you

49:41.520 --> 49:43.409
with whatever it
is you so require.

49:43.720 --> 49:45.722
In that case, yes.

49:46.080 --> 49:48.731
And when you say... "more"?

49:49.080 --> 49:50.206
A man.

49:52.160 --> 49:54.766

49:54.840 --> 49:55.921
Can we discuss this?

49:56.000 --> 49:57.126
FINNEGAN: I like
this ambition.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.771
You were right, Igor.
The beast was dangerous...

49:59.920 --> 50:01.410
...but now we have
the opportunity

50:01.480 --> 50:02.925
to show the value
of our work.

50:03.080 --> 50:07.608
You and I, Igor... we shall
create a man after our own...

50:15.440 --> 50:17.283
...civilized...

50:18.600 --> 50:20.125
...man.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.602
I'll want another
demonstration.

50:26.440 --> 50:28.442
I want to know whether
you can take direction.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.760
Follow orders, so to speak.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.291
Is that a problem?

50:31.520 --> 50:33.522
Victor, we cannot.
No.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.045
Excellent!

50:37.040 --> 50:38.883
Expect to hear from me soon.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.046
You did not create
this technology

50:45.120 --> 50:46.610
and yet you presume to
tell me how to use it.

50:46.760 --> 50:48.444
You should know your place!

50:50.960 --> 50:53.327

the ways of the world

50:53.440 --> 50:55.480
cannot hinder the furtherment
of my experimentation.

50:55.560 --> 50:57.483
But surely you see
you have no control.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.404
Surely you have forgotten

50:59.480 --> 51:01.642
what I did for you
at the circus!

51:03.480 --> 51:06.802

It is your destiny.

our only ally on this planet.

what we will do...

51:16.440 --> 51:18.807
...if it ensures the
furtherment of our research.

Turpin, Scotland Yard.

I'm afraid that's
not convenient

52:32.720 --> 52:33.721
at the moment, sir.

52:34.080 --> 52:36.128
May I know your business?

52:59.040 --> 53:00.724
Do you miss the circus?

53:02.720 --> 53:04.563
I'm not sure what
you mean, sir.

53:05.480 --> 53:07.164
Get me Frankenstein.

53:28.960 --> 53:30.962
I've informed the college
I would happily pay

53:31.080 --> 53:33.003
for the damage. Just
a bit of broken glass.

53:33.160 --> 53:34.844

involved apparently.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.485
There was indeed.

Mr. Straussman and I

53:37.840 --> 53:40.002

in the study of...

...chimpanzees.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.482
It's quite... quite
fascinating, actually.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.611
We have discovered that
by using emotional cues...

53:48.680 --> 53:50.842
...we can teach them
primitive belief systems.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.089
Of course, it's only because
they are not yet capable

53:53.160 --> 53:55.527
of higher logical thought.

53:56.520 --> 53:57.560
Where is the creature now?

53:57.680 --> 53:58.681
Dead.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.843
Poor thing. Had to be
put down, didn't it?

54:01.160 --> 54:03.811
Why would the police be
interested in such a trifle?

54:04.040 --> 54:05.201

54:05.320 --> 54:06.845
with a murder

(CHUCKLES)

54:16.720 --> 54:17.960
Mr. Frankenstein,
I warn you

54:18.040 --> 54:20.964
that there are consequences
for obstructing police work.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.682
I should like to see
records of your experiments

54:23.800 --> 54:25.165
for the past twelve months.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.362
If you cannot cooperate,
then, by God,

54:27.480 --> 54:30.006
I'll conduct a thorough
search of these premises.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.690
"By God," you say?

54:35.040 --> 54:36.485
Inspector, I must
inform you...

54:36.560 --> 54:38.324
...that you are currently
in the home of rational,

54:38.400 --> 54:39.686
free-thinking men.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.405
To violate it or my research

54:41.520 --> 54:42.960
would require a
proper legal warrant.

54:43.080 --> 54:44.605
And God has no
authority here.

54:44.680 --> 54:46.250
Tread lightly, sir.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.201
You may insult me,

54:48.320 --> 54:50.721
but you impugn the
Lord at your peril.

54:51.000 --> 54:53.890
I should remind you that
life is a sacred creation.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.401
Are you a police officer
or a theologian?

54:57.720 --> 54:58.801
Let me tell you
something for nothing.

54:58.880 --> 55:01.929
Life... I'll say this
very slowly... is merely...

55:02.080 --> 55:04.765
...the application
and outcome of applied chemistry.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.760
And did you or did you
not apply such chemistry

55:06.840 --> 55:08.640
at the Royal College of
Medicine two days ago?

55:08.720 --> 55:11.291
Igor, when was the last time
you went to confession?

see whether we have sinned.

sin shall not prosper."

(VICTOR SIGHS)

55:17.120 --> 55:18.724
And I will ask
you again, sir:

55:18.840 --> 55:20.001
Why are you so interested,

55:20.080 --> 55:21.730
nay, infatuated
with this case?

55:21.920 --> 55:23.600
Surely there are more
interesting mysteries

55:23.680 --> 55:25.284
to be solved in London.

55:25.920 --> 55:26.921
Or...

55:27.280 --> 55:29.169
...is it precisely
because this experiment,

55:29.240 --> 55:31.447
which you imagine
took place...

55:31.760 --> 55:33.205
...may very well discredit

55:33.280 --> 55:34.770
your own primitive
belief system?

55:34.960 --> 55:36.962
Uncover what you will
about me, Inspector.

55:37.120 --> 55:39.160
Men like you have always
stood in the way of progress

55:39.200 --> 55:41.965
and invariably been
left in its wake.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.640
You toy with
wrathful forces.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.766
And there's no
mercy in nature.

56:07.160 --> 56:08.446
Good day.

56:12.280 --> 56:14.123
I'll be back
with a warrant.

56:32.840 --> 56:35.525
That thing in the
school, Igor...

56:37.320 --> 56:40.051
...I looked into its eyes
and there was nothing there.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.768
There is a difference
between using your machines...

56:46.880 --> 56:49.360
...to restore a life
wrongly lost and...

56:49.640 --> 56:52.484
...to create something that
was never supposed to exist.

56:53.480 --> 56:55.209
Victor must understand that.

56:55.480 --> 56:56.481
Look...

56:57.520 --> 57:00.000
...I never thought
I'd leave the circus.

57:00.360 --> 57:03.364
I thought I'd be in there
till I died. And Victor...

57:03.720 --> 57:06.371
...has given me all this.

57:07.400 --> 57:10.006
And all he asked is
that I believe in him.

57:10.320 --> 57:12.004
I understand that, Igor.

57:12.400 --> 57:14.050
What I'm saying is...

57:14.400 --> 57:17.404
...don't let yourself be
bullied by anyone ever again.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.843
Victor says he's
your friend.

57:21.840 --> 57:23.842
But if you believe
Victor is on a wrong path,

57:24.000 --> 57:25.843
then you must make a stand.

57:32.760 --> 57:34.410
I have to go.

57:43.360 --> 57:47.206
Victor, if you truly respect
me as a scientist...

57:47.560 --> 57:49.927
If you truly respect
me as your friend...

57:50.560 --> 57:52.722
...you must listen
to my concerns.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.846
Igor.

57:59.000 --> 58:00.286
Sir.

58:00.600 --> 58:02.602
What's it been?
Three years?

58:03.440 --> 58:04.965
You look slimmer.

58:05.760 --> 58:07.967
I'm sorry, sir, I don't...

58:08.240 --> 58:10.083
Is Victor here?
Yes, sir.

58:10.240 --> 58:11.571
Very well.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.770
Where have you been?

58:15.920 --> 58:18.924
Not wise to be out on the town
when there's a manhunt on.

58:19.600 --> 58:21.648
Get off his heart!

58:24.800 --> 58:25.801
Father.

58:26.600 --> 58:27.761
Get up.

58:30.120 --> 58:31.485
Leave.

58:34.960 --> 58:36.928
VICTOR: Father, I'm so
excited that you've come.

58:37.040 --> 58:38.166
Your timing is impeccable.

58:38.320 --> 58:39.367
I've had such
breakthroughs with my...

58:39.440 --> 58:40.805
I don't care.

58:41.920 --> 58:44.526
I don't care about your
poorly researched theories

58:44.600 --> 58:46.125
or your disastrous
experiments.

58:46.320 --> 58:47.840
Not poorly researched,
I've told you...

58:47.920 --> 58:49.763
Victor, silence.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.602
Yesterday I received
a telegram...

58:52.760 --> 58:54.285
...informing me
that you are to go

58:54.400 --> 58:56.448
before the board of
directors at the college.

58:56.600 --> 58:58.807
They say you neglect
your schoolwork.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.445
(LAUGHING)

59:02.680 --> 59:04.682
They intend to expel you.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.090
No, they can't!

59:10.800 --> 59:11.801
Can't they?

59:11.960 --> 59:13.610
The work I am doing
is far more important...

59:13.680 --> 59:14.806
...than anything
they are conducting

59:14.920 --> 59:16.809
at that damn school.
You're a fool, Victor.

59:16.920 --> 59:18.968
You always have been.

59:20.200 --> 59:22.487
If only you could have
been more like Henry.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.645
But you...

59:26.040 --> 59:28.520
You just bring shame
to the name Frankenstein.

59:28.800 --> 59:30.484
I will ensure that the
name of Frankenstein

59:30.600 --> 59:31.681
is never forgotten!

59:32.040 --> 59:33.041
(GROANS)

59:36.000 --> 59:38.048
You've done it again, Victor.

59:39.360 --> 59:42.489

own life you've ruined.

59:49.640 --> 59:50.641

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.882

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.761
My man.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.410
He was going to be
the modern Prometheus.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.890
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.248
He's also not
nearly big enough.

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:49.245
Yes. What?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.447
Gordon was fast
and strong, sure,

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.721
but he couldn't
sustain any of that.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.921
And towards the end,

01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.724
he was having some
real trouble breathing.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:58.251
Breathing?

01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.809
Embolisms. Embolisms in his lungs.
Yes, of course.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.284
How stupid.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.081
So much raw energy
coursing around his structure.

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.611
His body couldn't
take the charge.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.081
Wretched creature would have
been dead in ten minutes.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.005
If we want to build something
that can live and stay alive,

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.605
we'll need a lot
more energy.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:16.807
Tons more.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.645
Just stop. What could possibly
generate that kind of...?

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.091
BOTH: Lightning!

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.090
Yes, I have...

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.406
...just the thing.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:29.801
One of my early designs
for the Lazarus Fork...

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.246
...incorporated a structure

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.005
that actually
sucked its energy...

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.163
...from the atmosphere.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:38.527
It's possible that we can
build a larger version

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.806
that would simulate
a static burst...

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.281
...similar to that
of lightning.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.443
No, it's the same problem.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.444
We can't just make the body
accept that charge.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.490
We are incapable of simply
making larger organs.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.524
What if we gave him
two sets of lungs?

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.489
You know you're
brilliant, don't you?

01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:04.643
Why wouldn't we? He's our man.
We can do what we like.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.842
Not just two sets of lungs...

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.365

Yes!

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.200
Pump all that blood
around the larger body.

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.169
Absolutely. He'd need it.

father was here...

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.691
I was reading.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.121
I didn't hear a thing.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.645
Did he say anything
interesting?

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.525
No, he didn't.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.562
Yes. Yes, do that.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.170
A larger chest cavity...

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.607
...to incorporate four lungs.

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.250
Two sets on the left
and the right.

run through the body.

Here's to him.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:03.925

this on the way.

No.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.241

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.080
It's gone too far.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.482

have the time.

here to be part of...

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.161

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:16.330
Of being lied to by you?

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:19.529
Of being hunted by the police
and chased by monsters?

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.011
Well, if you're
going to concentrate

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.161
on the dark side.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.685
I'm not leaving.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.082

illustrious career as...

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:28.720

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.524
You're a fool.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.444
I created you.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.568
You think that just because
I put you in a back brace

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.961
and you cut your hair...

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.203
...you can turn
your back on me?

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.044

the world on your own?

with your acrobat

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.962

and your new life.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.204

Victor's been very forthcoming
with his designs.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:01.044
But I still need him for now.

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.966
You, on the other hand...

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.364
So, let's see.
Your benefactor has departed...

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.809
...your home has been
ransacked by police...

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.964
...your identity
revealed as a fraud...

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.361
...and you know far too much
for me to let you walk away.

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.443
What I'm getting at,
old boy...

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.444

you won't be missed.

The body, the frozen creature,
that was Straussman.

The young man pretending
to be Straussman

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.321

alongside Finnegan...

From the whole force, in fact.

You are on a medical

You had no warrant,
Roderick.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.121
Do you have any idea
the lengths I have been to...

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.885
...in order to protect you
from criminal charges?

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.721
It was a necessary action.

Yes, a conspiracy
to create life in...

...a direct, defiant
action against God.

You were the best detective
Scotland Yard had,

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.811
but now it's time
for you to rest.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.809
You must heal.
And when you return,

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.204
I took possession of
this when I was... ten.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.482
It was a very cold
winter that year.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:40.366
We lived in the country then.
It was a happy time.

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:42.689
We crept out of
my bedroom window

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.807
because we wanted to
play in the snow...

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:45.120
...and so we did.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.645
Until we were...

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.483
...engulfed by a blizzard.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.244
I almost died.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:57.165

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.005

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.923
...and dawn finally broke...

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.165
...I was alive.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.926
I looked into my hand
and I was holding this.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.409
It serves to remind me.

01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:18.330
Remind you of what?

That God...

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.162
...if at all
He does exist...

01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:31.204
...sent us into this
world imperfect.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.045
We're weak.

01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.205
We're fragile.

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.689
And we're destined to die.

that is not good enough.

I don't care.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.326
What?

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.482
Finnegan's motives
mean nothing to me.

01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:53.008
I will turn the tide of human
existence here, tonight.

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:56.164
Then this world which
has spurned me...

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.846
...will forever
remember my name!

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.365
No, if you do what he asks,

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.329
no one will remember
Frankenstein the man.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.005

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.291

Your brother was with you!

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:18.685
Henry Frankenstein.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.684
He was with you that night.

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.842
Was he older or
younger than you?

01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.771
He was older.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:28.128
You must have
looked up to him.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.044
Where did you get that?

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:34.361
I wouldn't be surprised

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.124
if it was your idea,
though. Was it?

01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:39.445
To go out into the snow.
And he protected you.

01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:42.521
And he died
while you lived.

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.440
Isn't that what all
this is about, Victor?

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.042
You want to stop
other people...

01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.885
...from having to endure
that pain that you felt.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.407
No.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.721

No.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:09.641
It's about so much
more than that.

01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.129
Don't you see?
To my mind...

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:17.089
I took my brother's
life that night.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.845
I have to redress
the balance.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:29.403
I have to create life now.

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:34.321
Victor, none of
this does that.

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:39.488
This only brings more
and more and more pain.

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.527
And whatever path this is
that you've gone down,

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.364
this is not you.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.446
