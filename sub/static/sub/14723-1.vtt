00:57.808 --> 00:59.891
OK, let's try this, please!

06:21.464 --> 06:24.451
Meanwhile, some shepherds

06:24.551 --> 06:26.119
were tending their flocks at night,

06:26.219 --> 06:29.303
when suddenly, an angel
appeared right before them.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.593
I bring good news.

06:35.395 --> 06:39.090
For today, in a village, was born...

06:39.190 --> 06:41.009
That's good.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.678
In the city of David,

06:43.778 --> 06:47.891
there is born for you a Saviour,
who is Christ the Lord.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.267
I'm sorry.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.436
It's good. Continue.

06:51.536 --> 06:55.951
And this will be the sign for you.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.667
You will find a baby wrapped

07:01.630 --> 07:06.159
in cloths and lying in a manger.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.286
The hymn now.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.706
Glory to God in the highest,

07:11.806 --> 07:15.345
and on earth peace among men
with whom He is pleased.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.109
Who is that?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.630
Hey!

08:21.001 --> 08:23.038
- Who is that?
- There!

08:23.753 --> 08:25.614
Over there. Something moved.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.876
- Go and see.
- Yes.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.047
Stop!

08:58.455 --> 09:00.572
Aah!

09:05.462 --> 09:07.499
Sh, sh, sh.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.296
It's all right.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.685
That's my son! Is he all right?

09:29.569 --> 09:31.231
Is he all right?

09:32.280 --> 09:33.640
That's my son!

09:33.740 --> 09:36.142
- Is he all right?
- Yes, yes.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.279
Oh, my.

09:40.104 --> 09:43.121
All right. You're all right.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.485
Thank you.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.821
Don't pedal your way back now!

09:47.921 --> 09:52.211
You wrote that the human race
is "unimportant".

09:53.223 --> 09:56.162
Not at all. All I said was
that it's happened before

09:56.262 --> 09:58.456
and it will continue to happen
again and again...

09:58.556 --> 10:01.001
Nothing like this
has ever happened before. Come on!

10:01.101 --> 10:03.253
They're still counting the dead.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.339
Please don't miss my point on purpose.

10:06.439 --> 10:10.093
This kind of brutality can be
pursued back to biblical times,

10:10.193 --> 10:11.344
and what I said in my article

10:11.444 --> 10:13.930
was not that the rest of the human race
is unimportant.

10:14.030 --> 10:18.560
I only stated that, above all,
it is the self that mustn't be betrayed.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.478
Well, let's look at the Bible, then.

10:20.578 --> 10:24.993
I suppose one could say that
Pontius Pilate did not betray his self.

10:26.668 --> 10:31.823
Well, that is certainly a banal illustration

10:31.923 --> 10:35.702
and one that most scholars
would surely disagree with,

10:35.802 --> 10:38.246
but all right.

10:38.346 --> 10:42.250
The tragedy is not only that
Pontius Pilate betrayed his self

10:42.350 --> 10:46.212
but that hundreds in the crowd
before him did betray their selves.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.673
And that's what I wrote
was the tragedy of war.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.093
Not that one man has
the courage to be evil.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.982
But that so many have not
the courage to be good.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.767
# Some day in gay Paris

10:58.867 --> 11:00.984
# I will make you marry me... #

11:02.036 --> 11:04.022
Damn it.

11:04.122 --> 11:07.567
All right, Charlie.
Looks like you're four behind.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.910
Let's forfeit this awful game.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.200
For your sake. Another?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.743
Why not?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.584
I appreciate the company.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.582
# And I'll do that for you

11:22.682 --> 11:27.212
# I love your eyes,
they make me feel so... #

11:27.312 --> 11:29.380
When did that brain of yours get so big?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.132
# You're teasing me

11:31.232 --> 11:33.718
# Why can't we parlez-vous... #

11:33.818 --> 11:36.513
The house isn't so bad!

11:36.613 --> 11:39.140
Lucky man, aren't you, boy?

11:39.240 --> 11:42.060
It's too grand for just the three of us,

11:42.160 --> 11:44.395
- and it's a bit isolated.
- # If you'll do this for me

11:44.495 --> 11:47.190
# Then I'll do that for you,
oui oui, Marie #

11:47.290 --> 11:49.984
Well, it's not too far from me.

11:50.084 --> 11:52.952
I am in Paris less and less now
if I don't have to be.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.824
# Will you do this for me?

11:55.924 --> 11:58.712
- # Oui, oui, Marie #
- Let's see what we have here.

12:01.471 --> 12:05.340
And it doesn't seem to be
in such poor shape, does it?

12:06.893 --> 12:11.012
We took it off my sister-in-law.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.051
They cleared out at the start of the war.

12:15.151 --> 12:18.735
The house has just been
sitting here empty since they left.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.215
Came with a bad cook and a maid.

12:24.869 --> 12:28.314
Ah, I don't know... If we start
to fix something, I think if it's worth it.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.656
Who knows how long we'll be here?

12:31.467 --> 12:33.211
It might be a while.

12:33.311 --> 12:37.157
Doesn't help you being on the side
of the eternal optimist, does it?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.618
Well, there it is. Already, the French
don't feel what we're proposing

12:40.718 --> 12:42.871
is a harsh enough response.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.831
Well, no European would,

12:44.931 --> 12:48.376
regardless of what Wilson
and the Americans are proposing.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.670
The war was fought on their soil.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.590
It's their future
doctors and fathers lost, not yours.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.727
There it is. There it is.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.970
Clemenceau would prefer to have Germany,

12:59.070 --> 13:01.107
the whole goddamn country, dissolved...

13:02.699 --> 13:04.225
Well...

13:04.325 --> 13:07.068
With some patience, it'll be all right.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.113
How's the wife liking it out here?

13:12.416 --> 13:15.284
Took her a week to get over
a bad case of boat sickness,

13:16.254 --> 13:17.995
but she likes it fine.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.326
Happy to be back in Europe, I'd say.

13:21.426 --> 13:25.872
I remember her telling Catherine and I that
she lived in Strasbourg for some time, yes?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.751
Mm-hm. Spent much
of her childhood life there, in fact.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.878
She's got memories.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.339
Honestly, I think it's half the reason

13:34.439 --> 13:36.681
Secretary Lansing asked me to come along.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.680
She impressed him with her French
at a... a dinner party, something or other,

13:42.780 --> 13:46.399
and he seemed to assume
that I too speak the language.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.743
Little did he know!

13:53.458 --> 13:57.195
She's already discovered
the church adjacent.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.038
- It'll keep her and my boy occupied.
- Oh.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.168
These are rather peculiar.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.508
Hm...

14:09.307 --> 14:11.417
Well, brother-in-law's in textiles,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.212
and it would seem
he does well for himself.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.005
Textiles?

14:16.105 --> 14:19.047
You and I are in
the wrong business, my friend.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.554
I've never met him.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.266
My wife says he's a Muslim.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.476
It was a bit of a scandal.

14:28.576 --> 14:32.866
The entire property is covered with these
grim little statues, if you hadn't noticed.

14:34.572 --> 14:37.566
There's more and more
of them here every year.

14:37.676 --> 14:40.443
It's another reason to get
out of the city.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.428
Mona!

14:59.190 --> 15:00.508
Mona!

15:00.608 --> 15:03.761
You gave her the night off. How was it?

15:03.861 --> 15:07.070
Our son's not speaking to me.
He's had an accident.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.977
Everything all right?

15:11.077 --> 15:14.522
He's fine. I'll come down in a moment.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.651
We've got company.
Charles drove me back from the city.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.278
Charles?

15:20.378 --> 15:22.165
Charles Marker?

15:22.964 --> 15:25.700
- I thought you were in Germany.
- Not any more. I'm here.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.837
Hello there.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.423
He's been acting out a bit.

15:35.518 --> 15:40.434
He had dress rehearsal
at church this evening.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.761
How's his French coming along?

15:44.861 --> 15:47.148
Well, it's certainly better than mine.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.708
You put blood on my dress.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.175
Why would you do that?

16:13.973 --> 16:16.010
Why would you want to hurt anyone?

16:22.773 --> 16:25.426
That was very embarrassing to do
in front of Father Laydu

16:25.526 --> 16:28.179
and all our new friends at the church.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.848
They're not our friends.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.816
Maybe not yet, but they will be.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.071
Do you love them more than me?

16:40.708 --> 16:42.620
The people here in town?

16:44.545 --> 16:46.081
Yes.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.173
What do you mean?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.887
God gave me your father and you.

17:10.988 --> 17:14.732
Without Him, there would be no you,
or me to take care of you.

17:15.785 --> 17:18.573
So, you love them more than me?

17:20.623 --> 17:22.034
No.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.912
Say your prayers before bed.
Put your hands together.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.452
Lord, make me an instrument
of Your peace...

17:32.552 --> 17:35.761
- Can I say them in my head?
- Yes.

17:55.116 --> 17:58.029
- Are you finished?
- Amen.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.404
We have a friend downstairs.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.989
You must sleep.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.957
And tomorrow,
you'll apologise to Father Laydu.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.803
You were going to leave
without saying goodbye?

18:32.903 --> 18:34.931
No, of course not.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.819
I just didn't want to disturb you, my dear.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.812
Ah, you've come to join the expatriate.

18:41.912 --> 18:43.949
For the time being, yes.

18:45.041 --> 18:47.568
I thought you were in Germany.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.905
Well, initially it seemed like it was safer

18:51.005 --> 18:53.658
to be in the eye of the storm, over there,

18:53.758 --> 18:56.751
but perhaps not the best place
for me to be any more.

18:58.012 --> 19:01.832
I don't work for that publication any more,

19:01.932 --> 19:04.710
but I keep myself
busy with several others.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.463
Even doing a bit of writing for myself
every once in a while.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.049
Pleased to hear it.

19:10.149 --> 19:15.972
I recently got called out of hiding
to cover the negotiations in Paris.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.849
And voilà, who do I find
walking down the boulevard?

19:18.949 --> 19:22.687
Providing there is something to
eventually celebrate at the end of all this,

19:22.787 --> 19:26.148
I suggested we might throw
a party here at the house.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.942
I know a number of very fine people

19:28.042 --> 19:30.778
who'd take any excuse
to come out to the countryside.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.822
Always been a big supporter
of your husband.

19:32.922 --> 19:36.033
He knows how I feel generally about
statesmen and their politics.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.590
I do.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.998
Do you both some good
to make some friends while you're out here.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.806
Well, sure, as soon as we are settled.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.138
Do you have plans for Christmas?

19:49.345 --> 19:53.884
No, I... He's already asked me,
and I said I'll think about it,

19:53.984 --> 19:58.979
but I generally want to avoid the holidays,
and stay out of the way.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.435
Is everything all right upstairs?

20:02.535 --> 20:05.438
- He's tired.
- What happened?

20:05.538 --> 20:08.482
He threw rocks at someone
after the rehearsal.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.943
What? Why?

20:11.043 --> 20:14.405
I don't know. I was still inside
waiting for him,

20:14.505 --> 20:18.367
and a man from town ran after him,
and he ran straight into a tree.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.621
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.873
I'm sure it's all right,
he's only a little boy.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.334
He didn't actually hurt anyone, did he?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.669
- No, I don't think so.
- Then it's all right.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.921
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

20:31.021 --> 20:34.550
I'd like to see him next time,
if he's having a better night.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.141
Of course.

20:37.236 --> 20:41.515
Well, I'm so happy to...
to see a familiar face.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.278
Thank you. Me too.

20:45.327 --> 20:48.731
Well, I'll leave you both for bed. Er...

20:48.831 --> 20:50.358
Goodbye.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.943
Be safe getting home at this hour.

20:53.043 --> 20:56.238
- Such a vile language.
- Oh, stop it.

20:56.338 --> 21:00.034
Hey. Not too corked
to make it back in one piece, are you?

21:00.134 --> 21:02.842
Hm. No, I'll be perfectly safe.

21:04.513 --> 21:08.223
Goodnight to you both.
I'll, er... be in touch.

21:17.109 --> 21:21.274
You know his wife
was killed travelling with him.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.200
That's why I didn't ask about her.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.428
I had a bad dream and I wet the bed.

24:38.727 --> 24:40.764
Look at your face.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.976
You wet your bed?

24:45.401 --> 24:48.178
I had a dream you weren't there.

24:48.278 --> 24:50.315
I wasn't where?

24:51.281 --> 24:53.113
Wherever I was.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.743
It's all right. I'm right here.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.958
Go change your clothes and
I'll come up and change your bedding.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.503
He's really hurt.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.467
When did I give Mona tonight off?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.384
Uh... Yesterday afternoon.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.976
All the same.
He'll want me to tuck him in.

26:30.380 --> 26:33.283
- Hello.
- Get off the bed, darling.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.786
Come and see the snow before it melts.

26:35.886 --> 26:38.845
Aah! There we go.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.969
Did you miss me?

26:45.145 --> 26:48.138
What's happened
to your handsome little face?

27:11.713 --> 27:14.751
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

27:23.809 --> 27:26.768
Ahh! Stop dragging your feet.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.199
Hey, hey! Come on!

29:01.782 --> 29:04.393
- Yes? Good morning.
- Good morning.

29:04.493 --> 29:06.860
We're here to see Father Laydu, please.

29:16.463 --> 29:18.125
Yes, enter.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.620
One of your parishioners
has come to see you.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.133
Ah. Send her in.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.466
Ah, the little troublemaker!

29:36.566 --> 29:38.594
- Good day.
- Good day, Father.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.179
How are you both?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.347
Very well, thank you, Father, and you?

29:42.447 --> 29:45.861
Very well, thank you. Please sit.

29:48.287 --> 29:52.566
And the rest of your family?
You are all settling in?

29:52.666 --> 29:54.610
Yes, we're very happy, Father.

29:54.710 --> 29:58.454
But we need to hire more help
at the house. It's quite large.

29:59.589 --> 30:02.743
You should speak to
Madame Guibert in the rectory.

30:02.843 --> 30:05.204
She might be of some help.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.670
Thank you, Father.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.168
I haven't seen your husband at Mass.

30:11.268 --> 30:13.545
We only have him for a few days
every week.

30:13.645 --> 30:16.632
My husband works as Assistant Secretary
to our Secretary of State.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.134
He's working now with everyone in Paris.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.554
Ah, we have a celebrity among us.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.014
Hardly.

30:24.114 --> 30:28.644
I've heard about your husband.
He's English or American?

30:28.744 --> 30:31.730
American.
He works on President Wilson's staff.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.690
Is that so?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.526
Well, he doesn't have much
direct contact with the President.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.743
He works for Secretary Lansing.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.865
Please, sit down.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.672
Take a seat.

30:45.302 --> 30:49.888
The Americans are doing
a very honourable thing in this country.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.919
We're very happy to have them here.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.963
We're happy to be here. Thank you, Father.

30:56.063 --> 31:00.509
I... I've brought my son
with me to apologise

31:00.609 --> 31:03.220
for the incident last night
at the rehearsal.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.232
Oh, well, I missed it all.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.740
Does your son speak French?

31:11.578 --> 31:14.106
My husband preferred
us not to speak it at home.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.774
For fear of being excluded.

31:15.874 --> 31:20.070
But he's learning with a girl
from the village who speaks English.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.697
She's been giving him lessons

31:21.797 --> 31:24.700
and is helping him with his lines
for the Nativity play.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.955
Why not you?
You speak very well for an American.

31:30.055 --> 31:32.968
Oh, no, I'm not American.
That would be impressive!

31:34.059 --> 31:36.753
My father is German, actually.
He was a missionary.

31:36.853 --> 31:39.298
My sister and I learned several languages.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.508
I would like my son
to have the same experience.

31:41.608 --> 31:45.443
I thought it better he learn from
someone local, someone younger.

31:46.738 --> 31:50.851
Well, you must excuse me.
My English is rather poor,

31:50.951 --> 31:53.534
not even fit for a child.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.286
- You'll translate for me?
- Of course.

32:02.212 --> 32:04.281
You look nervous.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.668
There's no need to be nervous here.

32:07.467 --> 32:10.871
You look nervous. There's no need to be.

32:10.971 --> 32:13.623
What happened to his face?

32:13.723 --> 32:16.209
The poor thing.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.676
He was running away
last night and fell down.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.090
Ah.

32:22.190 --> 32:26.470
Last night, you were throwing rocks
at people after the performance.

32:26.570 --> 32:27.971
Is that right?

32:28.071 --> 32:30.891
- You were throwing rocks...
- Yes.

32:30.991 --> 32:34.325
- Ah. You understand me when I speak?
- Sometimes.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.647
Were you angry with someone?

32:37.747 --> 32:40.490
With one of the children
who's in the play with you?

32:41.877 --> 32:44.279
Were you angry at someone?

32:44.379 --> 32:46.917
One of the other children of the play?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.708
Angry at your mother?

32:51.928 --> 32:53.885
Were you upset with me, he asks.

32:56.099 --> 32:59.592
Would you answer me
when I speak to you, please?

33:03.398 --> 33:06.106
Will you please answer me, young man?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.889
Father Laydu would like to help.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.226
All he's asking is for you
to answer his questions.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.069
Do you understand his questions?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.822
Look at me.

33:23.668 --> 33:27.364
- Do you understand his questions?
- Yes.

33:27.464 --> 33:31.458
Good. Would you still like
to participate in the Christmas play?

33:32.636 --> 33:34.621
Yes.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.963
Would you like to make an apology to me?

33:38.350 --> 33:42.254
Are you going
to say you're sorry to Father Laydu?

33:42.354 --> 33:45.257
I didn't do anything to him.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.842
Stop.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.718
Stop it!

33:48.818 --> 33:51.096
What did he say?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.390
He says he wasn't doing anything to you.

33:53.490 --> 33:56.028
He doesn't understand
why I brought him here.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.564
Well, he's a smart boy.

34:00.664 --> 34:04.484
Maybe it would be best for him
to address our parishioners directly

34:04.584 --> 34:06.862
at Sunday Mass instead.

34:06.962 --> 34:09.489
In the meantime,
he will have time to think it over.

34:09.589 --> 34:13.299
It's not always easy
for a young person being in a new place.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.505
Yes, Father.

34:22.351 --> 34:24.309
Leave me be!

34:25.021 --> 34:26.808
Come back!

34:29.275 --> 34:30.687
Come back!

34:34.656 --> 34:36.568
Come back, please!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.161
Please!

34:53.592 --> 34:55.629
I'm sorry, Mama.

35:08.857 --> 35:10.926
Thank you for coming so quickly.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.969
Of course. Thank you for the opportunity.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.554
What is your name?

35:14.654 --> 35:16.473
Edith or Edy.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.225
Edith is fine.

35:18.325 --> 35:21.102
- And how old are you, dear?
- 24, madame.

35:21.202 --> 35:22.896
Do you have children?

35:22.996 --> 35:25.023
Yes, madame, but...

35:25.123 --> 35:26.489
And the father?

35:27.792 --> 35:30.278
He hasn't yet been found.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.280
But we feel that he's still alive.

35:32.380 --> 35:33.916
Oh, my poor dear.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.671
She has an excellent reference
from Madame Guibert.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.705
She's been very kind to me.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.999
She's taken a liking to my boy.

35:43.099 --> 35:46.294
- How old is your son?
- 12.

35:46.394 --> 35:49.297
- Hello.
- 12?

35:49.397 --> 35:52.759
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Hello, Adélaide. Not at all.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.469
- Hello.
- Hello.

35:54.569 --> 35:57.013
- I'll show you the kitchen.
- How are you?

35:57.113 --> 35:58.932
Fine. And you?

35:59.032 --> 36:02.400
We had quite a week here.
I think he'll be happy to see you.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.772
- He's been upset with me lately.
- Oh?

36:05.872 --> 36:07.857
Why is that?

36:07.957 --> 36:10.290
He caused a bit of a stir at our church.

36:13.046 --> 36:16.366
- How was he in the rehearsal?
- He did well.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.785
You did very well with him.

36:18.885 --> 36:21.580
He must be in his room, upstairs.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.387
Come with me.

36:24.516 --> 36:27.054
I thought you were playing in your room.

36:28.603 --> 36:30.595
- Hello, Ada.
- Hello.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.772
Where do you want to work?

36:34.526 --> 36:35.858
Here's fine.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.014
But there's no desk.

36:39.114 --> 36:41.151
We won't need one for the moment.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.395
Well, I'll leave the both of you to it.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.532
I'll be in my room if you need me.

36:57.507 --> 37:00.124
- Were you spying on us?
- No.

37:01.302 --> 37:04.122
You weren't listening to our conversation?

37:04.222 --> 37:06.965
- You didn't hear us?
- I heard you.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.055
- Shall we begin?
- Yes.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.341
What's that?

37:14.441 --> 37:16.593
- Nose.
- Whose nose?

37:16.693 --> 37:18.595
My nose.

37:18.695 --> 37:21.264
- And this?
- Ear.

37:21.364 --> 37:23.058
- And this?
- My eye.

37:23.158 --> 37:26.061
Mm. Very good. And these?

37:26.161 --> 37:28.073
- My eyelashes!
- Very good!

37:29.456 --> 37:32.567
I'm a girl and you're a...

37:32.667 --> 37:34.124
A boy.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.999
I am French and you are...

37:39.883 --> 37:42.869
Mother says we're citizens of the world.

37:42.969 --> 37:43.953
Hm.

37:44.053 --> 37:46.716
Citoyens du monde...

37:48.975 --> 37:51.012
Mm...

37:57.275 --> 37:59.678
Do you know what animal this is,
the word for it?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.806
- It's easy.
- What is it, then?

38:02.906 --> 38:05.865
- A lion!
- Good... Very good.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.951
Do you want to take me on a walk?

38:35.355 --> 38:38.550
Where's your father today?

38:38.650 --> 38:42.178
I don't know. He's working in the city.

38:42.278 --> 38:45.521
Mother says we're lucky we were
welcomed here with him.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.367
Other people from home
didn't get to bring anyone.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.147
Do you like it here?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.365
- I don't know.
- Do you prefer home?

38:58.545 --> 39:00.947
I might prefer home if I were you.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.130
It can be sad here sometimes.

39:04.801 --> 39:08.169
What do you say we practise
your monologue for Wednesday?

39:22.610 --> 39:24.220
You know the word "to cut"?

39:24.320 --> 39:26.139
I don't know.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.448
- Like, "to cut hair."
- Stop!

39:31.619 --> 39:33.781
- Did I tickle you?
- No.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.791
- Does your mother have you keep it long?
- No.

39:40.295 --> 39:43.406
You're a little boy.
You should cut it off.

39:43.506 --> 39:45.463
You'd be very handsome.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.997
I bring good news.

39:51.097 --> 39:54.681
For today, in the city of David...

40:06.195 --> 40:13.394
It is thanks to all your
constant devotion and prayer

40:13.494 --> 40:16.606
that we may go on to celebrate

40:16.706 --> 40:22.247
the end of such
grotesque fighting and violence.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.243
Still, it is important to acknowledge

40:28.343 --> 40:32.163
that there is no true victory

40:32.263 --> 40:35.802
in this war or in any other.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.881
Even if we have lost so much

40:41.981 --> 40:44.724
that it is something
impossible to quantify,

40:46.110 --> 40:48.179
God, who is looking down upon us,

40:48.279 --> 40:51.474
does not want you mourning
only your losses,

40:51.574 --> 40:56.104
but the losses of our enemy, as well.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.858
It is only human that a response of
forgiveness may feel like surrender.

40:59.958 --> 41:04.373
I want to assure everyone that this feeling
is a profoundly misleading one.

41:08.967 --> 41:13.913
Right now, in our capital,
leaders from all over the world

41:14.013 --> 41:17.750
are gathering
to discuss the potential for peace.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.254
- He's speaking about you.
- Our Pope, Benedict XV,

41:21.354 --> 41:23.840
will certainly be requesting
a role in the discussions.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.843
...wants to come and discuss with you...

41:26.943 --> 41:30.054
Needless to say,
above political and economic arguments,

41:30.154 --> 41:32.396
a higher vision must also be represented.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.645
And what more appropriate day for us

41:37.745 --> 41:40.148
to celebrate the birth of our saviour,

41:40.248 --> 41:44.538
as we too celebrate
the rebirth of our nation?

41:45.545 --> 41:49.084
So, all together, let us pray.

42:00.560 --> 42:02.426
Amen...

42:05.606 --> 42:10.021
And now, without further ado,
I give you the children.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.649
Come on.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.367
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.

42:32.467 --> 42:36.579
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.
I'm sorry for throwing rocks at you.

42:36.679 --> 42:38.136
I'm sorry...

42:38.890 --> 42:40.347
I'm sorry...

42:41.434 --> 42:43.169
- My dear friend...
- Thank you, Father.

42:43.269 --> 42:44.805
I'm sorry...

42:46.022 --> 42:49.509
- Merry Christmas, Beatrice.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

42:49.609 --> 42:51.135
I'm sorry...

42:51.235 --> 42:54.524
- So, children, Merry Christmas,
- Merry Christmas, Father.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.141
Merry Christmas, Father.

42:57.241 --> 43:00.109
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you.

43:04.499 --> 43:07.162
I'm not sure how long I can stand this.

43:18.346 --> 43:20.133
I'm sorry I threw rocks at you.

43:22.975 --> 43:25.378
What's she apologising for?

43:25.478 --> 43:29.340
Oh, there was a little incident
at our rehearsal last week.

43:29.440 --> 43:34.429
You seem like a nice little girl,
and I'm certain you are sorry.

43:34.529 --> 43:36.486
I'm not a girl!

43:44.580 --> 43:46.196
Merry Christmas.

43:50.253 --> 43:51.994
How are you, dear?

44:20.116 --> 44:22.449
My darling.

45:02.366 --> 45:06.687
The lion... woken...

45:06.787 --> 45:08.523
Woke.

45:08.623 --> 45:12.110
- And immobilise...
- Immobilised.

45:12.210 --> 45:16.114
It's old French. Do you understand?

45:16.214 --> 45:18.501
- Yes.
- Go on.

45:19.926 --> 45:23.044
...the mouse under his great paw.

45:24.180 --> 45:28.265
"What am I going to do with you?"

45:29.518 --> 45:35.383
he asked the mouse.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.927
I can't go on.

45:38.027 --> 45:39.887
Sure you can.

45:39.987 --> 45:42.765
I'll do it for you.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.652
Listen to my voice. Ahem.

45:45.826 --> 45:48.896
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

45:48.996 --> 45:53.991
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his outstretched paws.

45:55.461 --> 45:59.198
The lion woke and immobilised
the mouse under his great paw.

45:59.298 --> 46:02.743
"What am I going to do with you?"
he asked the mouse.

46:02.843 --> 46:07.623
"If you let me leave," cried the mouse,
"I'll make it up to you one day."

46:07.723 --> 46:11.711
The lion was so tickled at the idea
of the mouse being able to help him

46:11.811 --> 46:13.723
that he lifted his paw and let him go.

46:15.231 --> 46:19.635
Some days later, some hunters
caught the lion in a trap

46:19.735 --> 46:24.730
and tied him up with rope
in order to transport him the next day.

46:25.741 --> 46:30.605
That night, the little mouse
happened to pass by,

46:30.705 --> 46:34.609
and saw the terrible plight the lion was in.

46:34.709 --> 46:39.780
The mouse, true to her promise,
helped out the lion.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.999
She gnawed at the rope with
her sharp little teeth and freed the lion.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.925
And you see the moral here?
Read that to me.

46:50.057 --> 46:55.803
On souvent... besoin de... de...

46:57.064 --> 47:01.183
en plus petit que souhaite.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.931
Do you know what that means in English?

47:05.031 --> 47:09.116
It means
little friends may prove great friends.

47:12.246 --> 47:15.358
I think that should conclude
our lesson for today.

47:15.458 --> 47:18.236
- What do you think?
- Yes. I'm hungry.

47:18.336 --> 47:22.323
Well, then, perhaps we should ask
Edith to fix you some food.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.291
- Shall I ask her on my way out for you?
- Yes.

47:27.887 --> 47:31.040
I'm very impressed with you, you know?

47:31.140 --> 47:35.044
Just think back to the first day we met.
Quite an improvement.

47:35.144 --> 47:37.505
No, it isn't.

47:37.605 --> 47:39.590
Yes, it is.

47:39.690 --> 47:44.178
It's going to take time, but you will
arrive at where you are headed.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.315
I will make sure of it.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.249
Do you have some fire?

49:03.315 --> 49:07.303
- Hello there, chap.
- Oh, dear.

49:07.403 --> 49:09.722
You must be famished.

49:09.822 --> 49:12.600
I plain forgot to ask for your treat.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.353
Your mother's in town, I believe.

49:15.453 --> 49:18.022
I didn't know you were home.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.159
Yes, home early.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.833
I returned from
the city just a moment ago.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.164
Give your father a hug.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.744
No thank you, Edith.

50:11.592 --> 50:13.458
Thank you.

50:16.305 --> 50:19.625
Give us grateful hearts, O Father,
for all thy mercies,

50:19.725 --> 50:22.211
and make us mindful
of the needs of others.

50:22.311 --> 50:25.673
- Through Jesus Christ our Lord, amen.
- Amen.

50:25.773 --> 50:27.184
Amen.

50:38.077 --> 50:40.604
Not hungry, darling?

50:40.704 --> 50:42.946
You said he was famished earlier.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.580
I don't like it.

50:49.922 --> 50:52.908
- Nevertheless, finish your food.
- But I don't like it.

50:53.008 --> 50:55.077
I don't like the food here.

50:55.177 --> 50:58.038
Neither much do I, chap,
but I will finish it all the same.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.721
We don't want to hurt
Edith's feelings, do we?

51:02.184 --> 51:05.087
What is it you do in the city all day?

51:05.187 --> 51:07.520
You know what your father does.

51:09.483 --> 51:11.600
But what does he actually do?

51:13.779 --> 51:18.100
It's much too complicated for you to
understand in its entirety, I'm afraid,

51:18.200 --> 51:22.521
but I help our President
of the United States.

51:22.621 --> 51:27.662
I am a helper to the President
of the United States of America, you see?

51:29.878 --> 51:31.915
Put that back in your mouth.

51:33.632 --> 51:36.952
Was Ada giving Father
French lessons today?

51:37.052 --> 51:38.884
What's that?

51:40.264 --> 51:42.631
Was Ada giving you a French lesson today?

51:43.767 --> 51:46.420
No. I was paying her.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.137
- But it's Monday.
- She asked for an advance.

51:53.694 --> 51:55.721
Oh, that's right.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.858
She asked me yesterday.

52:21.555 --> 52:24.333
Do you know what he said to me?

52:24.433 --> 52:26.627
You will never believe it.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.255
He said, "Mum...

52:29.355 --> 52:32.424
"Does it always hurt this much
when we love someone?"

52:32.524 --> 52:35.344
Oh... It's not true.

52:35.444 --> 52:37.680
I know it's a bit silly, but...

52:37.780 --> 52:39.515
Mona.

52:39.615 --> 52:41.277
Excuse me, madame.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.562
He will sit with you
until he finishes his meal.

52:44.662 --> 52:46.939
I don't care if it takes all night.

52:47.039 --> 52:49.372
- Yes, madame.
- I'm going to bed.

53:25.285 --> 53:27.527
May I take a bite?

53:39.758 --> 53:42.341
Ugh. Horrible.

53:43.262 --> 53:44.548
Disgusting!

53:55.899 --> 53:58.186
Sh. Hm?

54:02.865 --> 54:06.279
Do not tell me out.

54:18.630 --> 54:20.658
Eh, la!

54:20.758 --> 54:22.590
Eh, la!

54:23.635 --> 54:25.126
Aah!

54:38.150 --> 54:40.511
We are offering Trentino

54:40.611 --> 54:43.430
and a few other small territories
to Orlando.

54:43.530 --> 54:47.524
- Will he be satisfied?
- I doubt it, but we should hope so.

54:49.536 --> 54:52.523
I will have to spend
a few nights in the city.

54:52.623 --> 54:55.442
I trust you will be fine on your own.

54:55.542 --> 54:57.829
I'm not on my own. I have a full house.

55:26.031 --> 55:28.684
Seven times nine makes?

55:28.784 --> 55:30.602
63.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.646
A little bit harder this time.

55:32.746 --> 55:34.362
Nine times nine?

55:36.834 --> 55:38.370
81.

55:39.211 --> 55:41.248
Very good.

55:43.549 --> 55:46.994
What are you doing? That's not right!

55:47.094 --> 55:51.039
Why... why would you do that?
Who taught you that?

55:51.139 --> 55:53.722
My mother lets me do it all the time.

55:54.852 --> 55:56.889
That cannot be true.

55:58.397 --> 56:00.924
Please apologise.

56:01.024 --> 56:03.061
What did I do wrong?

56:05.654 --> 56:09.193
- I think we should stop for today.
- I'd like to continue.

56:10.242 --> 56:12.728
No. Not today.

56:12.828 --> 56:16.732
You have to apologise when
you make someone uncomfortable.

56:16.832 --> 56:20.402
I'm sorry
for making you feel uncomfortable.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.539
Hold your hand out.

56:27.801 --> 56:34.041
# At the end of the rainbow,
there's happiness

56:34.141 --> 56:40.172
# And to find it, how often I try

56:40.272 --> 56:43.717
# But my life in the rain

56:43.817 --> 56:47.095
# Is a wild-goose chase

56:47.195 --> 56:49.973
# And my dreams have all been denied #

56:50.073 --> 56:53.987
THE NEW FEMININE HEALTH AND BEAUTY

56:55.621 --> 57:00.108
# Why have I always been a failure?

57:00.208 --> 57:04.452
# What have the reasons been? #

57:31.531 --> 57:34.476
Make me an instrument of your peace.

57:34.576 --> 57:36.687
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

57:36.787 --> 57:40.274
- Where there is injury, pardon.
- Where there is doubt, faith.

57:40.374 --> 57:42.109
Where there is despair, hope.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.361
Where there is darkness, light.

57:44.461 --> 57:46.418
Where there is sadness, joy.

57:50.592 --> 57:53.036
O Divine Master,
grant that I may not so much

57:53.136 --> 57:55.622
seek to be consoled, as to console,

57:55.722 --> 57:58.041
to be understood, as to understand,

57:58.141 --> 58:00.335
to be loved, as to love.

58:00.435 --> 58:03.171
For it is in giving that we receive.

58:03.271 --> 58:06.133
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.

58:06.233 --> 58:10.178
And it is in dying that we are born
to Eternal Life. Amen.

58:10.278 --> 58:12.014
Amen.

58:12.114 --> 58:16.018
# Chasing rainbows, waiting... #

58:16.118 --> 58:18.812
Edith, please serve the first dish.

58:18.912 --> 58:25.910
# ...to find a little bluebird in vain

58:57.659 --> 59:02.147
# Some fellows look and find the sunshine

59:02.247 --> 59:07.527
# I always look and find the rain

59:07.627 --> 59:12.074
# Some fellows make a winning sometimes

59:12.174 --> 59:16.828
# I never even make a gain

59:16.928 --> 59:20.791
# Dee, dee, dee

59:20.891 --> 59:29.091
# I'm always chasing rainbows

59:29.191 --> 59:34.930
# Waiting to find a little bluebird

59:35.030 --> 59:40.867
# In vain #

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:33.540
Mother, who are they?

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.889
All right, let's call the head.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:00.640
Well, he just turned up here.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.976
Make sure that you take care of it,
you understand?

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.895
I understand. Of course.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:06.897
Excuse me.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.034
Pleasure to see you, my dear.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:13.195
Why are all these people here?
It's a holiday.

01:01:13.295 --> 01:01:16.281
Orlando and his staff are...
leaving the conference.

01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.492
- What?
- They are going back to Rome.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:20.452
It's chaos in the city.

01:01:20.552 --> 01:01:22.913
Secretary Lansing sent them home with me.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.333
We are gonna be conducting
some meetings out here.

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.425
- Why here?
- It's private here.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.392
And Wilson doesn't know about this?

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:40.180
Uh... Most major policy decisions
he is making by himself.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:45.268
He doesn't consult us except to ask
where some place falls on a goddamn map!

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.896
It turns out I am not the only one

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:50.732
feeling that diplomacy
has been pushed aside.

01:01:50.832 --> 01:01:52.869
Transport...

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:56.988
Listen, it's nothing grave,

01:01:57.088 --> 01:02:01.833
we just need our own place where we
can discuss more realistic ideas openly.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:06.838
- It is just a discussion.
- Are there members of the cabinet here?

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:11.461
Some might be coming, yes, but please
don't concern yourself with it

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.381
- and go upstairs.
- There's also a statement from...

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:16.758
Do you realise what trouble
you could all be in?

01:02:16.858 --> 01:02:20.022
Yes, I'm aware. It's only
for a few days over the holiday.

01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:27.310
What should we do for lunch?
I can't accommodate all these people.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.021
- Where is Mona?
- Don't worry.

01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:31.815
Everything has been taken care of.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:35.454
Mona is taking care of everything now.
She has plenty of help.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.293
Ah, there you are. Erm...

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:52.419
It's still not enough
to cover the region's losses.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:55.547
Shouldn't they feel lucky
to be receiving any aid at all?

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:58.717
It's quite far east.
What if they take after the Bolsheviks?

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:01.386
Isn't it dangerous to be
throwing money after them?

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:05.473
Is anyone here actually concerned
about a communist revolution?

01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:08.894
- The Old Europe is quite strong, you know.
- No, we do not know.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:14.608
Please enlighten us. If it were so strong,
then why are we here?

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:17.068
Marxism seems to have taken a stronghold

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:18.320
over this part of the world.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.822
Don't confuse Marxism with Bolshevism.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:25.257
The Russians have recently ignored
some significant sections of Marx's texts.

01:03:26.177 --> 01:03:29.581
What he professed was that
"Capitalism must come first..."

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:33.585
This brings on industrialisation,
which in turn will bring up a working class.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.630
And that working class
will inevitably rise up

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:39.674
and an organic communism will take effect.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:44.054
As I see it, it was an attempt at
fortune-telling and not a call to arms.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.264
You seem to know a fair lot about it.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.392
I am an economist. It is my job
to know a fair lot about it.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:54.564
These debates are healthy!
More importantly, they are necessary.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.776
We do appreciate
your education and your position.

01:03:57.876 --> 01:04:02.864
I only ask that, as we move forward,
you appreciate ours, as well.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:05.533
Thousands upon thousands further west

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:08.967
would be most positively
affected by reparations paid,

01:04:09.929 --> 01:04:11.623
so I suggest we move on.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.125
There is significantly less damage there.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.253
Perhaps, but more citizens.

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.381
In Paris, delegates are coming

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.384
to ask for countries, colonies.

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:24.469
They are coming to ask
for votes for women.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.263
But away from all that noise,

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:31.601
what we must use this opportunity
to discuss here quietly is coal.

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.363
Go.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:38.285
While I have addressed this
in many of my prior presentations,

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:44.948
it does not seem to be evident to those
presiding over the negotiations

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:47.742
to what extent
Germany is reliant on her coal.

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.911
If we go after the Saar basin,

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:53.581
it will leave Germans with
no way back and nothing to build upon.

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.667
We go after their coal,

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:59.087
it will give them no chance to repay
their debts or rebuild their nation.

01:04:59.187 --> 01:05:01.047
Rebuild their nation?

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.258
What right do the enemy possibly
have to rebuild

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.802
while the rest of the
continent is starving to death

01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.929
and dying of influenza?

01:05:08.029 --> 01:05:10.765
Wilson preaches peace
without vengeance or victory,

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:14.269
but it is just too emotionally removed,
too intellectual.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.730
Where I am in step
with my President, however,

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:20.358
is that one way or another,
we will force the world to be a better place.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:22.575
Mark my words.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.075
We can't acknowledge each
community's system of belief.

01:06:10.175 --> 01:06:11.826
Have you found anything?

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.912
This is the best map I could find.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:17.040
The decision of what places
of faith are reconstructed

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.541
and those which are not.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.753
We'll approach this in a secular manner.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:23.310
Excuse me.

01:06:26.816 --> 01:06:29.511
- Yes?
- Where's Ada?

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:32.695
- This must be your daughter.
- My son.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:39.118
I apologise.
I... I hardly got a look at him.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:43.326
Where were we, gentlemen?

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:26.526
May I acknowledge
that there are multitudes

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:29.209
of different faiths living
within this region?

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.464
Who is to say how one group
should be favoured over another?

01:07:34.425 --> 01:07:38.163
Or what that economic division
could do to their community?

01:07:38.263 --> 01:07:41.082
I'm willing to accept
your point about faiths.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:43.970
- But the legal framework...
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:49.347
...the region doesn't
leave much room for...

01:07:57.865 --> 01:07:59.197
Why aren't you dressed?

01:08:05.164 --> 01:08:07.531
- Mona!
- Mona!

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:11.994
Go to your room.

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:15.922
Go to your room.

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:41.975
What in the hell are you doing in here?

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:43.520
The boy's running around naked!

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.688
- I'm sorry... I don't.
- I have people here!

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:48.997
People I'm working with,
and he's running around naked!

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.247
- The boy?
- Yes.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:55.948
What's the word in French?

01:08:56.049 --> 01:08:58.158
Look, just go upstairs
and tend to him. Go!

01:08:58.259 --> 01:09:00.296
- Yes.
- God damn it.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.886
Darling. It's me.

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.734
Open the door, dear.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.019
- What's going on?
- Oh!

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.313
I don't know, madame.

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:29.899
The little one had a quarrel with his father.

01:09:29.999 --> 01:09:33.653
Something about how he was dressed.
And now he won't come out.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.988
Leave him alone, then.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:39.457
And stop making so much noise.
I have a terrible migraine.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.061
Darling. It's only me.

01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:00.606
I have something for you.

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.153
- What are you doing in here, chicken?
- Thank you.

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.858
Should I put you to bed?

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:15.153
No, thank you. Come back tomorrow morning.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.869
OK.

01:10:18.506 --> 01:10:21.492
- Mona?
- Yes.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:25.051
- Can you bring me something?
- Yes, sir.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.169
Ah, good evening...

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.997
Darling, we're leaving shortly.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:10.583
We've had some good news, perhaps.

01:11:10.683 --> 01:11:14.921
I'm not yet sure how long
I need to be in the city,

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.183
but I will get in touch when I can.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.106
Yes, dear.

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.195
While I'm away, put the boy straight.

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:36.699
I want him how he used to be.

01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.122
I'll see to it.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.715
Here comes the lads right now.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:10.685
You know what I think?

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.729
I'm not feeling well.

01:12:12.829 --> 01:12:14.445
Sh.

01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:19.068
I want another child.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.862
- What?
- I want another one.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:25.502
Maybe a little girl
who's your spitting image.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.091
- I can't, for my health.
- You are perfectly healthy.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:36.467
Mm.

01:12:38.563 --> 01:12:40.173
Having him...

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.310
it nearly killed me.

01:12:46.904 --> 01:12:48.987
S-Stop.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.576
I'm bleeding.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:58.538
- I could make you, you know?
- I'm sorry, I...

01:13:05.590 --> 01:13:07.992
I'm leaving.

01:13:08.092 --> 01:13:11.085
I've lost the notion. Goodbye.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.731
Madame?

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:43.075
Tell him he won't be fed
until he's dressed and out of his room.

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.167
Yes, madame.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:10.680
- Hello?
- Yes?

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.612
Darling, it's Ada.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.905
Can you open the door for me?

01:14:19.997 --> 01:14:22.733
We have our lesson today, remember?

01:14:22.833 --> 01:14:24.449
I'm busy.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.831
Come back in three days.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.350
Excuse me, do you have a moment?

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.066
Mm-hm.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:03.034
I went up to his room
and he refused to see me.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:06.624
He told me to come back in three days.

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.623
I'm not surprised.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:13.659
I'd say come back in three days, then.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:15.716
No cause to negotiate.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.208
Yes, madame.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.336
He will be bored by then.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:26.099
If not, we'll starve him out of there.

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:35.312
Adélaide?

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:38.106
Yes?

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:42.908
Do you know of any reason
why he may be acting this way?

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.998
Not that I know of, no.

01:15:48.335 --> 01:15:51.703
I only ask because of something
he said several weeks ago.

01:15:57.053 --> 01:15:58.464
No.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:02.881
Anyway.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.973
Would you be so kind
as to mail these letters for me?

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:17.362
Thank you. That will be all.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:22.359
We look forward
to seeing you in three days.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:41.288
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:48.713
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his stretched paws.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:51.146
Stretched. Outstretched.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:26.344
- Is it good?
- Yes, thank you.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:34.518
Mona.

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.597
What did I ask you?

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.098
I'm sorry, madame.

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:44.362
But he was very hungry.
He's just a little boy.

01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:47.938
It's not your job to act as his mother.

01:17:48.038 --> 01:17:50.316
It's your job
to carry out my instructions,

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:52.485
because I know what's best for my son.

01:17:52.585 --> 01:17:55.696
He's a big boy
and he needs to learn how to behave.

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:58.991
Yes, madame. I'm very sorry.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:01.285
I'm afraid that will not suffice.

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:05.675
You immediately went behind my back
and deliberately went against my will.

01:18:06.181 --> 01:18:08.209
We care about you very much here, Mona.

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:10.050
I'll be sorry to see you go.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:16.634
It won't happen again, madame.

01:18:16.734 --> 01:18:20.387
This is a very difficult situation,
but it's too late for discussion.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:22.820
- Come with me.
- Oh!

01:18:33.792 --> 01:18:38.503
- Why was she crying?
- Oh, I've got your attention now.

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:42.409
Mona won't be with us any more.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:44.842
No! Aah!

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:01.393
Mona.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:22.463
Please, madame.

01:19:24.969 --> 01:19:26.676
Please.

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.387
Please, madame.

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:38.007
I don't have a family.

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:40.718
I've been with this house for 17 years.

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:42.901
And you have been with us
for just four months.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:20:02.379
I will devote every day
of my waking life to destroying your family.

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:09.343
You can show yourself out.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:14.585
Oh, excuse me, madame.
I did not mean to bother you.

01:20:14.685 --> 01:20:16.768
You too. Out.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:19.506
S-Sorry?

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:21.939
You'll make everyone here sick. Out. Out!

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.934
Darling, it's me again.

01:21:16.455 --> 01:21:19.163
Darling, would you please
open the door for me?

01:21:20.751 --> 01:21:23.529
Can you fetch my mother?

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.621
Yes, of course.

01:21:35.265 --> 01:21:37.257
You have something to say to me?

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:42.308
I would like to read this story for you.
I've been working very hard on it.

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:46.176
Oh.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:49.690
I thought you might be ready to come
outside and apologise to me.

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:54.977
Ahem.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:58.272
One day, whilst the lion was asleep,

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:04.664
the little mouse accidentally ran up
one of his outstretched paws.

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:12.995
The lion woke and immobilised
the mouse under his great paw.

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:17.583
"What am I going to do with you?"
he asked the mouse.

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:23.505
"If you let me leave," cried the mouse,
"I'll make it up to you one day."

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:27.509
The lion was so tickled at the idea
of the mouse being able to help him

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:32.181
that he lifted his paw and let him go.

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:36.268
Some days later, some hunters
caught the lion in a trap

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:41.523
and tied him up with rope
in order to transport him the next day.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:45.194
That night, the little mouse
happened to pass by,

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:49.573
and saw the terrible plight the lion was in.

01:22:49.673 --> 01:22:55.496
The mouse, true to her promise,
helped out the lion.

01:22:55.596 --> 01:23:00.432
She gnawed at the rope with
her sharp little teeth and freed the lion.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:02.920
And the moral is...

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:06.513
"Little friends may prove great friends."

01:23:11.612 --> 01:23:15.557
That was very good, my love. Impressive.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.851
Yes, that was...

01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.988
That was great.

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.149
Well done.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:25.984
It's not my doing.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.196
Shall I continue or are you satisfied?

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:31.504
No, that was very good, dear.

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:37.715
Well, then, I'd like to continue
studying on my own.

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:44.430
I won't be needing Ada any more.

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:54.899
Very well, then.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.573
Why don't you step out with me, dear?

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.448
I just need a few minutes.

01:24:12.548 --> 01:24:16.132
What do you say we get some clothes
on you and some food in your belly?

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:57.757
Did you know that I speak
four languages fluently?

01:25:12.983 --> 01:25:15.010
When I was your age,

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.602
I was still
travelling the world with my family.

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:22.281
I never once expected
to find myself in New York,

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.485
but there I was when I met my husband.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:29.034
I had no interest in being married.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:36.171
In fact, my aspirations
were quite in line with yours, I think.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:40.994
But he wouldn't give up.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.757
He asked and he asked...

01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:47.135
and he never gave up.

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.140
Do you want to be a teacher, Ada?

01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:55.477
What?

01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:58.226
In life?

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:02.321
Is this your aspiration? To teach?

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.899
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:08.372 --> 01:26:11.661
You don't want to get married,
have children of your own?

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.987
No, ma'am.

01:26:15.087 --> 01:26:17.170
Good.

01:26:19.341 --> 01:26:21.003
This is for you.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:58.878
Wouldn't you like to make some friends?

01:27:00.298 --> 01:27:03.327
What do you do up there, all by yourself?

01:27:03.427 --> 01:27:05.089
What do you do?

01:27:09.599 --> 01:27:12.919
Until I get someone here
looking after you again,

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:16.048
I'm afraid you will have
to bear my company.

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:17.764
It's fine.

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:28.560
Would you like to go outside and
breathe some fresh air together?

01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.697
I need to study.

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:45.243
I had a thought that you and I
could be friends again.

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:47.380
I'm going to my room.

01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:50.332
How about tomorrow?

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:53.085
- It's meant to rain through the week.
- Really?

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:55.222
What makes you think that?

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.478
What makes you think that?

01:28:47.405 --> 01:28:50.694
Sir. Come in.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:08.326
Ah.

01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.245
There he is. The man of the hour!

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:12.831
Charles. What are you doing here?

01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:15.584
I've just heard the news.
I came to congratulate you.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.721
What news is that?

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.013
The Germans have been summoned.

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:26.772
A final treaty in the series
is being drafted now.

01:29:28.488 --> 01:29:30.821
Well, that is wonderful news.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.728
I suppose we'll have to have that party.

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:36.911
It means we can go home.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:40.330
Where's our son?

01:29:41.543 --> 01:29:44.707
- In his room.
- In his room? Where's Mona?

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:48.158
I let her go.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.751
You were right.
She was making the situation worse.

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:55.842
He's just a little boy.

01:29:57.142 --> 01:30:00.931
You cannot allow a child
to run this household.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:37.926
Open this door.

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:42.430
Open this door, I said!

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.520
Answer me when I speak to you!

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:57.739
I am sick and I am exhausted
with your games.

01:30:58.828 --> 01:31:01.147
I am your father,

01:31:01.247 --> 01:31:05.833
and you will show some respect to me!

01:31:11.549 --> 01:31:14.286
If you do not answer...

01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.423
If you do not open this door,

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:22.554
I will give you a lashing
like you've never received!

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:28.597
I will count to three.

01:31:29.651 --> 01:31:31.643
One... One!

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:35.278
Two...

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.158
Three.

01:31:50.672 --> 01:31:53.506
Come here! I've had enough of this!

01:31:55.427 --> 01:31:58.244
We are going... Come here!

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:04.502
- We are going on a trip!
- Ah!

01:32:04.602 --> 01:32:08.214
- We are going to Versailles!
- Ah!

01:32:08.314 --> 01:32:11.718
Now you will put your clothes on
for this trip!

01:32:11.818 --> 01:32:13.935
No!

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:15.258
What's your name, dear?

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:16.968
Julie, madame.

01:34:17.068 --> 01:34:19.025
Julie, how far along are we?

01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:23.600
I'll have a look
in the dining room, madame.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.111
Thank you.

01:34:42.552 --> 01:34:44.204
Oh, now!

01:34:44.304 --> 01:34:46.136
That's not right.

01:34:48.141 --> 01:34:50.383
That's not what I asked for.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.928
Very good. I'm excited to try this.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:03.442
The kitchen's on the left, down the stairs.
Follow me.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.824
# Now, won't you listen, honey

01:37:26.924 --> 01:37:29.507
# While I say... #

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:40.797
Obviously, that's good, right?

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:42.934
It's beautiful, anyway.

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:48.972
Eriksen, it was a complete delight
to finally meet your better half.

01:37:49.072 --> 01:37:50.688
Pardon me...

01:37:57.580 --> 01:38:00.275
You must be very proud of your husband.

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:04.039
We are. And of his colleagues, of course.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:09.795
- Here. It would be lovely...
- It's nice to meet you.

01:38:12.387 --> 01:38:14.872
Laura is a reporter as well.

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:17.292
- Is that so?
- I was thinking...

01:38:17.392 --> 01:38:19.585
Well, not like Charles.

01:38:19.685 --> 01:38:21.963
I cover society events.

01:38:22.063 --> 01:38:25.898
Well, I do hope you enjoy the party.

01:38:50.925 --> 01:38:52.712
Hello there, little one.

01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:56.799
Hello, there.

01:39:25.626 --> 01:39:27.320
Excuse me.

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.707
- What is it?
- I'm hungry.

01:39:30.381 --> 01:39:32.418
We'll eat in a moment.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:40.631
What are you doing there?

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.475
Come with me.

01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:58.494
# I shall find it how often I try

01:40:58.594 --> 01:41:01.928
# But my eye didn't blink... #

01:41:04.892 --> 01:41:07.545
You're on the other side with me, darling.

01:41:07.645 --> 01:41:09.839
- I prefer it here.
- Up, up, up.

01:41:09.939 --> 01:41:12.633
Excuse me. I will gladly take his seat.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:15.100
- Oh. That's very kind of you.
- Of course.

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.399
Lucky you.

01:41:19.782 --> 01:41:21.819
How nice to see you. So...

01:41:37.967 --> 01:41:39.869
Hello again, everyone.

01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:45.666
Thank you very much for joining us
for this celebration tonight.

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:49.851
And thank you, my dear,
for arranging such a lovely party.

01:41:52.815 --> 01:41:57.512
Tonight, we celebrate
the end of the Great War.

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:59.444
Hear, hear!

01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:05.228
I'm not much up for a speech,

01:42:05.328 --> 01:42:07.813
so I will spare you that.

01:42:07.913 --> 01:42:12.735
Instead, I'd like to call on my wife
to guide us all in a short prayer.

01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:14.292
Darling...

01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:28.215
Why don't you lead us
in a prayer, my love?

01:42:30.978 --> 01:42:34.048
He's much less terrified than I
of public speaking.

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:37.141
He was wonderful
in a performance our church put on.

01:42:43.449 --> 01:42:44.735
No.

01:42:45.868 --> 01:42:48.952
- Just a short prayer.
- I don't believe in praying any more.

01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:55.117
- Why would you say that?
- I don't believe in praying any more.

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:59.031
- Take him upstairs.
- I don't believe in praying any more!

01:42:59.131 --> 01:43:01.826
- You! Stop it!
- I don't believe in praying any more!

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:04.161
I don't believe in praying any more!

01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:08.416
I don't believe in praying any more!
I don't believe in praying any more!

01:43:08.516 --> 01:43:10.334
I don't believe in praying any more!

01:43:10.434 --> 01:43:13.254
- I don't believe in praying any more!
- Get down and come with me.

01:43:13.354 --> 01:43:15.715
- I don't believe in praying any more!
- I'm sorry.

01:43:15.815 --> 01:43:17.852
- Prescott, get down!
- No!

01:43:21.612 --> 01:43:23.148
Come here!

01:43:41.632 --> 01:43:43.868
Come here.

01:43:43.968 --> 01:43:46.120
It's all right, it's all right.

01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:48.007
It's all right.

01:43:48.973 --> 01:43:50.416
Come here.

01:43:50.516 --> 01:43:52.627
Come on, come here. Come with me.

01:43:52.727 --> 01:43:54.920
Aah!

01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:56.886
- No!
- Here!

01:43:58.190 --> 01:43:59.271
Get back!

01:44:04.405 --> 01:44:05.862
Stop!

01:44:06.699 --> 01:44:08.684
Come back here!

01:44:08.784 --> 01:44:11.322
No! Let me go!

01:45:00.169 --> 01:45:02.832
It's all right, it's all right.

01:47:38.410 --> 01:47:40.493
Mr Secretary...

01:47:42.039 --> 01:47:44.156
Thank you, Councillor.

01:47:49.922 --> 01:47:51.663
Mr Advisor.

01:47:53.425 --> 01:47:55.291
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:48:04.395 --> 01:48:06.227
Mr Deputy.

01:48:07.064 --> 01:48:09.101
Thank you, Mr Advisor.

01:48:28.043 --> 01:48:32.629
Well, after all that,
I thought we might run out of ink.

01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:35.422
Next order of business?

01:48:36.593 --> 01:48:40.748
The security details surrounding
his tour of the facilities.

01:48:40.848 --> 01:48:42.249
Mr Advisor?

01:48:42.349 --> 01:48:45.669
Security has already checked
on safety hazards.

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:48.923
There's only one in and one out.

01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:51.091
How many workers present?

01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:54.730
- 448 in total.
- That's dwindled.

01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:07.149
I concur.

01:49:07.249 --> 01:49:09.081
Very well, then.

01:49:10.669 --> 01:49:13.662
- Send in my secretary, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:49:16.341 --> 01:49:17.618
Next?

01:49:17.718 --> 01:49:22.790
As reflected in executive order 13084,

01:49:22.890 --> 01:49:27.586
the coordination of the individual
deployment plans have been executed.

01:49:27.686 --> 01:49:32.341
The further working out of mobilisation
preparations for state and people,

01:49:32.441 --> 01:49:35.678
and of the mobilisation
of top authorities is underway.

01:49:35.778 --> 01:49:38.055
- Good.
- For this purpose,

01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:41.016
I advise the secretary's office
of the defence committee

01:49:41.116 --> 01:49:45.156
to compose a committee of specialists
from... from all ministries.

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.816
Should that be added to section G?

01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:50.782
Most definitely.

01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.736
Yes, sir?

01:49:52.836 --> 01:49:56.615
The Councillor has requested
that we please be well assured

01:49:56.715 --> 01:50:01.078
of secured access in and out
of the facilities on the 14th of May.

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:03.664
Yes, sir. I will arrange
a second inspection.

01:50:03.764 --> 01:50:05.916
Would everyone like to attend?

01:50:06.016 --> 01:50:08.053
I think that would be best, yes.

01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:10.337
Yes.

01:50:10.437 --> 01:50:13.896
- Will that be all, sir?
- Yes, thank you.

01:50:17.236 --> 01:50:20.014
Sounds to me like they're arriving now.

01:50:20.114 --> 01:50:22.151
Shall we, gentlemen?

01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.937
- Useful.
- Well...

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:08.860
That is the biggest problem we have,
that nonetheless...

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:36.215
Nice, nice round...

01:51:36.315 --> 01:51:38.352
However, there is no way...

01:51:48.452 --> 01:51:50.990
He's right. He's right. He's exactly right.

01:52:01.965 --> 01:52:04.002
Certainly can't get enough of that.

01:52:09.723 --> 01:52:11.760
Start small, and...

01:53:39.146 --> 01:53:41.388
Stop the car.

01:53:58.332 --> 01:54:00.369
I'll walk from here.
