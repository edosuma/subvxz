Silence, puny audience!

00:25.984 --> 00:30.238
And welcome to
Who Dares To Be
A Millionaire?

00:30.322 --> 00:33.408
Tremble before
Morbo's mighty likability,

00:33.492 --> 00:37.245
as I chitchat with
our first contestant,
Philip J. Fry.

00:37.621 --> 00:38.746
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:44.628 --> 00:46.170
Give him hell, Morbo!

00:47.756 --> 00:50.091
Prepare for pleasantries!

00:50.217 --> 00:52.635
So, Fry, what do you
do for a living?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.221
Me?
Can I phone a friend?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.639
Chitchat achieved!

00:59.017 --> 01:01.227
Are you ready to play?

01:01.311 --> 01:04.438
I didn't come to play,
I came to win.

01:04.522 --> 01:05.815
Now let's play.

01:05.899 --> 01:10.069
For $1, what tool is
used to hammer a nail?

01:10.154 --> 01:12.572
Is it, A, a hammer?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.574
B, a nail?

01:14.658 --> 01:16.451
C...
B, Nail! Final answer!

01:16.535 --> 01:17.618
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

01:20.164 --> 01:22.290
HERMES: Sweet dodo
of Lesotho!

01:22.374 --> 01:25.042
Don't you ever stop to think
before you speak?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.836
I never stop to
think about it.

01:27.337 --> 01:31.257
Leave Fry alone.
His intelligence is just
a little differenty.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.259
You a big dummy!

01:33.385 --> 01:36.679
Hey, I'm beginning to think
you guys don't think
I'm very smart.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.682
You can barely remember
your own name, Einstein.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.768
Einstein is a hard name
to remember.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.269
Ow!

01:43.353 --> 01:44.729
Smeesh, Professor.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.940
Don't have a shmaneurysm.
Fry's your distant relative.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.233
Not distant enough.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.320
I'll be a monkey's uncle
if I'm this monkey's nephew.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.698
(SNIFFLES) But you're
my only family.

01:55.866 --> 01:58.576
Who will hug me if
I achieve something?

01:58.869 --> 02:01.662
Oh, perhaps
I've been too harsh.

02:01.955 --> 02:07.376
Come, lad,
take my hand and I'll explain
why I find you so repugnant.

02:08.336 --> 02:11.964
All my life, I've been
inspired by great minds.

02:12.424 --> 02:15.676
Euclid, Copernicus, Braino.

02:15.969 --> 02:19.889
And my personal role model,
Leonardo da Vinci.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.933
What turned them to stone?

02:22.726 --> 02:25.895
Da Vinci was history's
greatest artist and inventor.

02:29.483 --> 02:30.525
VoilÃ !

02:30.609 --> 02:34.946
He invented flying machines,
war engines, submarines.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.281
Uh-oh.
Nibbler died
in the wall.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.660
That's not Nibbler.
That's my most
precious possession.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.411
Leonardo's beard!

02:42.538 --> 02:46.582
I paid a fortune for it
at an auction of
historic body parts.

02:47.751 --> 02:50.044
I suppose if I have
an Achilles' heel,

02:50.128 --> 02:52.880
it's because I bought it
at that same auction.

02:53.257 --> 02:57.134
Indeed so.
Most indeededly.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.803
Careful with that,
you fool!

03:00.264 --> 03:03.349
No! No!

03:04.017 --> 03:05.601
But possibly yes.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.603
What is it, Professor?

03:10.399 --> 03:14.527
Oh, my! It's da Vinci's
fabled lost invention.

03:14.611 --> 03:19.448
Even the scholars who wrote
of this device had no idea
what it was for.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.493
And now, at last,
neither do I!

03:22.578 --> 03:23.870
Maybe we can
figure it out.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.455
We? (LAUGHS)

03:27.958 --> 03:30.084
Well, I may not
have brain smarts,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.336
but at least
I have street smarts.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.593
I was in
the hospital two weeks.
No one visited me.

03:38.677 --> 03:39.802
Quiet, you!

03:39.970 --> 03:43.973
I'm trying to deduce
the function of da Vinci's
lost invention.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.349
Not even a card.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.352
He might have hidden a clue
in one of his other works.

03:48.437 --> 03:52.315
Ergo, I sent Bender out
for a copy of
The Last Supper.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.482
BENDER: I'm back!

03:53.650 --> 03:57.320
Everybody at Kinko's
was an idiot, so I just
brought the original.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.946
(GRUNTING)

04:04.578 --> 04:07.997
Jesus Christ,
and his 12 Apostles.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.248
That's odd.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.126
This hand here doesn't
belong to anybody.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.921
And it's pointing a knife
at James the Lesser!

04:15.005 --> 04:16.923
That's the great thing
about that hand.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.466
And what about
these funky table legs?

04:19.551 --> 04:22.261
It's like they're from
some other, funkier painting.

04:22.346 --> 04:24.931
Maybe da Vinci painted
over something else.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.641
It's called a pentimento.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.519
That's true, Dr. Zoidberg.
How did you know that?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.772
My doctorate is
in art history.

04:32.856 --> 04:35.191
Let's see what's
under The Last Supper.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.239
Wait a second!
I'm not big-boned,
I'm just fat.

Saint James
was a robot!

04:53.710 --> 04:57.338
My God!
Da Vinci left his legs
unpainted as a clue.

04:57.464 --> 05:01.676
My God!
This is the greatest
mystery of all time.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.596
We must fly to Rome
and exhume the body
of Saint James.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.599
Didn't we used to be
a delivery company?
To the ship.

05:40.132 --> 05:41.173
Psst.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.847
No time!
I've found a clue that

05:47.931 --> 05:50.599
could unlock all
the secrets of history.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.018

05:55.731 --> 05:57.606
I've got it!
We're in Rome!

05:57.691 --> 06:01.610
Don't be stupid.
It's a long-lost
mathematical code.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.780
I'll need to consult
these ancient writings.

06:08.326 --> 06:13.456

about the Fibonacci
sequence...

06:13.540 --> 06:14.540
Aha!

06:14.750 --> 06:18.127

how many paces
we need to take.

we're there.

let us pry.

It's true! Saint James
really was a robot.

robot heaven right now.
So he won't miss his eyes.

The Last Supper.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.633
The great man
Leonardo built me
as an artist's model.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.301
When I took repose
in this coffin,

07:07.594 --> 07:11.013
I carefully tossed
the real Saint James
in yonder heap.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.433
I'm sure you have
many questions.

07:14.518 --> 07:16.602

there is a chamber
where I used to

07:16.686 --> 07:18.646
speak with Pope John
the Patient.

I told him I'd be
back in five minutes.

Well, he'll make
a nice heap.

I am Animatronio,
guardian of da Vinci's
great secret.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.706
He left my legs visible
in the painting as a clue,

07:37.791 --> 07:39.875
then dispatched me
hither to await

07:40.001 --> 07:43.003
his shadow society
of intellectuals.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.005
Hi, Animatronio.

knew da Vinci?

07:49.052 --> 07:51.303
Was he nice?
How did his hair smell?

07:51.388 --> 07:54.890
And on a personal note,
what is the function
of this device?

07:54.975 --> 07:58.727
Halt!
You know not the function
of the machina magnifica?

07:59.062 --> 08:02.148

Where is the
great fountain?

give up so easily.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.405
Animatronio
mentioned a fountain.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.825
That's a statue of Neptune,
god of water.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.704
The number of points
on his trident is three,
or trey.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.624
The "U" in his name
is written like "V."

you call a space alien.

14:28.159 --> 14:29.201
Oh!

14:29.285 --> 14:30.869
It's an honor to
meet you, Leonardo.

14:30.954 --> 14:35.040
And may I say,
you were great in
Titanic. The Beach...

14:35.124 --> 14:38.085
That's Leonardo DiCaprio,
you blockhead!

14:38.503 --> 14:39.628
(GROANS)

14:40.088 --> 14:42.673
Looks like
eating rocks wasn't
as dumb as you said.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.011
So what do people
do for fun here?

14:48.096 --> 14:50.347
Do you enjoy
partying all night,

14:50.473 --> 14:52.766
with plenty of ale
and lusty women?

14:52.850 --> 14:54.851
I sure do!
Not us.

14:54.936 --> 14:58.564
We spend our leisure time
in the mathematics museum.

15:00.275 --> 15:04.444
Planet Vinci is basically
a single colossal university.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.113
How's your football team?

15:06.197 --> 15:07.322
Learned.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.492
Ooh! I'm going to check out
that math lecture.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.162
All this knowledge
is giving me
a raging brainer.

15:14.664 --> 15:17.374
Would you like to hear
the lecture, too, Fry?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.419
No.
It would just go in one ear
and out some other hole.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.337
Come. Sit down.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.715
Now, that I can do.
(GROANS)

15:25.383 --> 15:28.760
I have a terrible secret
to confess, Mr. DiCaprio.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.262
I'm not very smart.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.264
I appreciate your candor.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.851
I don't even know what
language you're speaking.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.605
I, too, have a confession.

15:39.689 --> 15:44.359
You see,
here on Planet Vinci,
I am the stupidest person.

15:44.694 --> 15:47.279
What? Who'd possibly
think you're stupid?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.114
Duh! I'm Leonardo!

15:49.198 --> 15:51.658
I don't know the mass
of the Higgs boson.

15:51.743 --> 15:54.202
Duh!
I have to draw in pencil,

15:54.287 --> 15:57.539
'cause I don't know how to
use rendering software.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.208
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:00.793 --> 16:03.795
Stupid Biff!
Thinks he's so smart.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.380
He looks stronger
than you, too.

16:05.465 --> 16:09.426
I went to Earth because
I could no longer
stand the ridicule.

16:09.510 --> 16:14.514
But being surrounded
by even stupider people
was equally infuriating.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.059
I can see myself
in your shiny button.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.394
Inventing is
what makes me happy.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.939
Or did, until I misplaced
the plans for my masterpiece.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.191
You mean these?

16:24.275 --> 16:27.444
(GASPS)
The machina magnifica?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.529
Infinite joy!

16:29.781 --> 16:33.325
Fry,
my friend, you have given
my life meaning again!

16:33.618 --> 16:36.828
That calculus lecture
was harder than I expected.

16:36.913 --> 16:40.290
We had to
answer every question
in the form of an opera.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.376
I have a lot of
homework for tomorrow,

16:42.460 --> 16:46.338
if I don't want
to be embarrassed.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.133
(INAUDIBLE)

17:18.037 --> 17:20.329
(ALL LAUGHING)

17:32.927 --> 17:34.386
(PLAYING RHYTHMICALLY)

17:35.972 --> 17:37.389
(ALL BOOING)

17:37.890 --> 17:39.433
Thank you. Thank you.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.227
And if you like that,
you'll love our main event.

17:42.353 --> 17:46.314
Ladies and gentlemen,
Leonardo DiCaprio!

17:46.607 --> 17:47.941
(ALL CHEERING)

17:48.776 --> 17:50.444
I mean, da Vinci!

17:50.695 --> 17:52.320
(ALL BOOING)

17:54.824 --> 17:59.578
For centuries,
you've ridiculed me.
Especially you, Biff.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.912
Nice hat!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.247
(ALL WHOOPING)

18:02.832 --> 18:06.835
But, at long last,
this invention will
show you.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.503
It will show you all!

18:09.297 --> 18:13.675
Behold, my unstoppable
doomsday machine!

18:13.760 --> 18:15.010
And I helped!

18:15.303 --> 18:18.513
Wait. You told me
it was an unstoppable
ice cream machine.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.475
Ice cream is
just a by-product
of the machine!

18:21.559 --> 18:24.394
Lts primary purpose
is to exterminate

18:24.479 --> 18:27.230
everyone who ever
made me feel inferior!

18:27.398 --> 18:30.692
Ooh! I'm so scared!

18:30.902 --> 18:33.028
Bring it on, dum-dum!

18:33.196 --> 18:34.696
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:36.741 --> 18:39.284
Oh, yeah? Let's see how
hard you're laughing

18:39.368 --> 18:42.537
when my doomsday machine
chops off your face!

18:54.425 --> 18:55.967
Leonardo, stop!

18:56.052 --> 18:57.219
(ALL GASP)

18:57.303 --> 18:58.887
I want in on this!

18:59.263 --> 19:00.931
Are you crazy, Professor?

19:01.015 --> 19:02.724
I hate these nerds!

19:02.850 --> 19:04.643
Just 'cause I'm
stupider than them,

19:04.727 --> 19:07.020
they think
they're smarter
than me.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.565
Kill them all,
starting with
the math teacher!

19:16.447 --> 19:17.906
(ALL SCREAMING)

19:24.205 --> 19:27.874
I knew this final invention
would be a humdinger.

19:27.959 --> 19:32.128
Yes. We three idiots will
finally have our revenge!

19:32.505 --> 19:34.130
I don't think so.

19:34.382 --> 19:38.426
You two make me ashamed
to call myself an idiot.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.850
There's always going to be
someone smarter than you,

19:44.934 --> 19:48.103
so the only way to be happy
is to make the most
of what you've got.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.479
But you've got nothing.

19:49.564 --> 19:50.605
Oh, no?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.734
I've got one single nail,
and another nail
to nail it in with.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.280
And I'm gonna stop this
infernal ice cream machine
once and for all!

20:00.700 --> 20:01.950
(SCREAMS)

20:18.467 --> 20:19.885
(ALL LAUGHING)

20:20.845 --> 20:24.222
Some doomsday machine!
It barely killed anyone!

20:24.307 --> 20:25.390
Oh, yeah?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.809
Well, take this!

20:30.479 --> 20:31.646
Oh, my.

20:32.023 --> 20:36.443
Poor Leonardo da Vinci.
He sure was stupid.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.365
Fry, I admire
what you did today,

20:42.450 --> 20:45.911
and I'm deeply sorry for
insulting your intellect.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.663
Your tiny, tiny intellect.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.707
Oops. There I go again,
you dope.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.083
I mean, dummy.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.168
It's okay.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.795
I may not be clever,
but I have a good heart.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.589
That's what my mom
used to say.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.841
She was a wise woman.

21:00.051 --> 21:02.052
Also, that I'm not
much to look at.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.888
A wise woman, indeed.
