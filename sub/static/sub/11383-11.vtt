JENNIFER:
Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:03.796 --> 00:05.582
JENNIFER: "Word of
The Witness. "

00:05.715 --> 00:08.502
Well, best before
September 2044.

00:08.593 --> 00:10.754
CASSIE: Isaw
a place called Titan.

00:10.887 --> 00:12.093
We can go there together.

00:12.221 --> 00:13.427
Then what?

00:13.556 --> 00:15.262
We kill The Witness.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.382
The search for Titan
only leads to death.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.302
We choose
the wrong mission now,
we don't get a second chance.

00:20.396 --> 00:21.602
We're going back to '57.

00:21.731 --> 00:23.062
Thank you both
for being here.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.640
What year is this?
(GRUNTS)

00:25.735 --> 00:26.815
I'm sorry, Cole.

00:26.903 --> 00:28.268
What did you do to me?

00:28.404 --> 00:29.519
Now, we are out of time!

00:29.614 --> 00:31.275
The Red Forest is
at our door!

00:31.407 --> 00:33.318
We found Titan.
Lock them up.

00:33.409 --> 00:34.945
But we can still do this.

00:35.077 --> 00:38.069
There is no "we."
Not anymore.

00:39.916 --> 00:41.406
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:13.491 --> 01:16.983
Mother, the storms!
You said there are
still some safe places.

01:17.119 --> 01:20.031
You know the path.
Why won't you lead us?

01:23.292 --> 01:24.828
Mother, please,
we are running...

01:24.961 --> 01:25.996
Out of time?

01:29.966 --> 01:31.502
Today is the day.

01:33.135 --> 01:37.629
One that ends at the beginning
and begins at the end.

01:41.477 --> 01:42.717
Resurrection.

01:42.812 --> 01:43.972
(THUNDER CRACKS)

01:45.982 --> 01:48.473
We need to leave.
What are we waiting for?

01:50.152 --> 01:51.312
James Cole?

01:53.823 --> 01:55.984
Mother, we will all
die here.

01:57.410 --> 02:01.574
There are many endings.
Today is one of them.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.262
(WIND HOWLING)

02:34.864 --> 02:35.899
How long have we got?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.401
Not long.
Six hours, maybe seven.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.584
You ready?

02:55.051 --> 02:58.760
So, how soon can I
splinter back to '57?
We need to hurry.

02:59.055 --> 03:01.421
We are working on it,
but the massive
paradox there

03:01.557 --> 03:04.139
makes programming yourjump
extraordinarily difficult.

03:04.769 --> 03:05.884
One wrong calculation

03:05.978 --> 03:10.813
and you could splinter
inside a brick wall or to
the middle of the ocean.

03:11.275 --> 03:16.815
And then our only
hope stopping this storm,
you, would be gone forever.

03:16.906 --> 03:18.487
You're sure
this'll work, right?

03:18.616 --> 03:20.231
We stop the paradox,
we fix time.

03:21.077 --> 03:25.241
It's more a hope
than a certainty.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.749
You all right?

03:28.084 --> 03:29.324
It's come down to this.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.831
If only the world
had a better physicist
to save it.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.625
I'm just here by default.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.714
You know, I never would have
done any of this

03:37.802 --> 03:38.837
if I didn't
believe in you.

03:39.637 --> 03:44.006
l'd temper that faith
until you see on
whom we are depending.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.348
Dr. Lasky?

03:49.688 --> 03:51.019
Thomas.
What?

03:51.941 --> 03:56.105
Uh, at least
another six hours?
I'm going as fast as I can.

03:59.031 --> 04:01.613
That's cutting it close,
the storm will be
right on top of us.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.110
There's no other option.

04:04.161 --> 04:07.278
I'm afraid the calculations
are Dr. Adler's expertise.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.376
JAMES: We can’t trust Adler.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.327
KATARINA: That’s why he
remains under house arrest,

04:17.466 --> 04:19.673
along with Dr. Rail/y
and Mr. Ramse.

04:22.138 --> 04:24.880
The worst thing
about betrayal is

04:25.015 --> 04:27.802
it never comes
from one’s enemies.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.140
I thought
you were locked up, too.

04:32.231 --> 04:33.721
We are. Were.

04:35.484 --> 04:36.519
Who is that?

04:38.737 --> 04:41.479
Hey, we recruited others.

04:41.574 --> 04:44.031
We're not the only ones
that have given up on Jones.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.535
She has no idea
how to stop this.
Neither does Cole.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.747
We're gonna
do this our way.

04:54.170 --> 04:55.660
You're taking
the facility.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.044
We found Titan.

04:58.716 --> 04:59.751
Tell her.

05:01.010 --> 05:04.468
Um, Titan appears to
be in Colorado,

05:04.555 --> 05:05.590
across the continent.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.424
Far too dangerous
for an overland trek.
Suicide, really.

05:09.852 --> 05:13.265
So,lcan
splinter us there.

05:14.106 --> 05:17.564
Time travel, without the time.
Instantly.

05:17.693 --> 05:20.435
Straight to The Witness.
We find him,

05:21.697 --> 05:23.198
we kill him.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.361
How are we gonna stop
the storms out there?

05:26.452 --> 05:28.113
After what he's done,
he has to have

05:28.204 --> 05:30.195
another way to
time travel, right?

05:30.289 --> 05:35.204
We use his way, his intel,
to go back and stop it.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.534
Undo everything
he's ever done.

05:36.629 --> 05:39.746
But I have to start
programming the jump.
It'll take hours.

05:39.882 --> 05:40.871
What about Cole?

05:40.966 --> 05:44.299
What about him?
We're not asking
for permission.

05:44.637 --> 05:45.717
A coup?

05:46.805 --> 05:49.842
Ramse, you were at Spearhead,

05:49.934 --> 05:51.265
you know how dangerous...
Hey.

05:52.311 --> 05:53.471
Look at me.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.939
Is The Witness in Titan?

06:05.407 --> 06:06.442
Hey.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.823
Is he?
Yes.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.158
You willing to
bet your life on it?

06:16.502 --> 06:17.617
Yes.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.586
Want you to stay here,
you get yourself ready.

06:25.803 --> 06:27.009
When the time comes,

06:31.475 --> 06:34.182
I don't want you
to think twice.

06:54.707 --> 06:56.413
Did you start
the evacuation?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.956
Transports are
loading up.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.333
What about Cassie
and Ramse?

07:01.005 --> 07:03.121
I figured you'd
want them out last.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.297
Just in case
they try anything.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.503
Yeah.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.213
That's what I thought.
(EXPLOSION)

07:09.388 --> 07:10.628
What the hell was that?

07:10.723 --> 07:11.963
(ALARM SOUNDING)

07:18.022 --> 07:19.353
What the hell happened?

07:19.481 --> 07:20.516
Lightning hit one
of the transformers.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.105
Yeah, we can't
slow down the evac.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.444
Have everyone take
the west corridor
to the vehicle bay.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.643
How many wounded?

07:25.738 --> 07:27.478
Two, one critical.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.408
She's gonna need a doctor.

07:40.919 --> 07:42.705
Need any help?
I got it.

07:43.839 --> 07:45.340
Though Iwonder if
everything I'm doing

07:45.507 --> 07:47.008
is just prolonging
the inevitable.

07:47.217 --> 07:48.423
(DEEP RUMBLING)

07:49.762 --> 07:50.922
You should
come with me.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.379
To 1957?

07:55.142 --> 07:57.224
You don't even know
who the Primary is back there.

07:57.728 --> 07:58.843
We'll find him.

08:00.022 --> 08:02.684
There is no "we."
Remember?

08:04.026 --> 08:07.018
The fight is here, Cole.
I'm not running away with you.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.654
Is that what you
think I'm doing?
Running away?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.815
I am trying...
Don't try to save me.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.531
I'd rather take my
chances in Titan.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.363
Will you bandage
her up, please?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.668
What you're doing
right now.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.495
Shutting down,
locking everyone else out,

08:26.590 --> 08:28.330
so you don't have
to feel the pain.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.341
That's running away.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.507
Cole, we could go to Titan.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.685
Find The Witness together.

08:42.064 --> 08:43.770
We'd never make
it there alive.

08:43.899 --> 08:46.982
Evenif
the anomalies didn't kill us,
there's scavs, militias...

08:47.069 --> 08:48.684
What if there
were another way?

Donnelly, Lawson.
Go check it out.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.452
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.545
Was that gunfire?

09:09.883 --> 09:10.918
What are you doing?

09:11.927 --> 09:14.589
This new way to Titan,
does it involve the machine?

09:16.265 --> 09:18.301
Secure the room!

You all right?

09:40.456 --> 09:43.573
Yeah. Ijust got
shot at, I'm great.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.408
We gotta talk!

09:53.510 --> 09:54.761
Don't shoot.

09:58.265 --> 09:59.471
Coming out!

10:16.992 --> 10:18.323
So, it's come to this, huh?

10:22.956 --> 10:27.074
Doesn't have to.
You just walk away,
let us use the machine.

10:27.169 --> 10:29.034
Not gonna happen.
There's no time.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.213
Enough time to
program one Iastjump.

10:33.342 --> 10:35.173
You don't know what
you're walking into.

10:36.345 --> 10:39.508
Jennifer told me
there's nothing
but death at Titan.

10:40.390 --> 10:41.516
You won't find him.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.342
You'll kill yourself trying.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.806
I'm already dead.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.182
You can't know.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.984
You never had a family.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.071
You've never been a father.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.696
I always thought
you were my family.

11:09.711 --> 11:11.167
I love you, too.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.175
Both of us are
not gonna end up
on the same side of this.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.923
You know that, right?
Can't let you
take the machine.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.593

I ain't gonna
stop them next time.

to end like this?

11:36.738 --> 11:39.946
You might get me,
but then they'll get you.

11:41.410 --> 11:43.571
Then neither of us
gets a chance.

Yeah, sometimes you
gotta lose to win.

Marcus shut the blast doors,
we are secure.

12:20.824 --> 12:24.442
But when
the calculations are finished,
you must splinter immediately.

12:24.578 --> 12:25.613
We're running out of time.

12:25.996 --> 12:28.487

the odds a bit first.

it would be Cassie
who would take you down.

were numbered
when you came back.

Never been like that.

he'd put a flag in her.

It's not like that either.

Why don't we have a drink
and talk about killing Ramse?

I say it's over.

to fix all this,

our tails forever.

playing defense.

to program the machine.

him in cold blood?

of people hurt, lady.

doesn't go to 1957.

You know we have a chance.

What'd I say?

The paradox in '57.
Mr. Cole can stop it.

We haven't been able to stop
a goddamn thing, Katarina.

not The Messengers
and not this bloody storm!

We are going to Titan.

to hurt you.

you have to, right?

Kill me. Kill The Witness.
It won't matter.

18:13.885 --> 18:16.877
You'll still be
afraid of yourself.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.384
Because you're
the one who let him in.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.490
The bullet went through,
missed the artery.

down the bleeding.

Hey, Cass.
You all right?

18:51.172 --> 18:54.630
I don't like it
any more than you do,
but it's what we have to do.

calculate the trajectory
and program the coordinates.

for our mission...

19:07.689 --> 19:08.678

19:08.815 --> 19:11.807
It was your mission.
Always has been.

from you.

charge anymore, lady.

you've pointed
a gun at me, Mr. Ramse.

there won't be a third.

Cole just unsealed
before he left.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.164
Cole's not crazy enough.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.378
It's not Cole's brand of crazy
I'm worried about.

is that a leader
needs to make sacrifices.

taking people on.

2016. The hotel.

29:41.155 --> 29:43.362
Go. Go!

29:47.495 --> 29:52.455
Cole, is this what
I become in the future?
A woman who's failed everyone?

29:53.167 --> 29:54.327
No.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.794
Then tell me what happens.
How does this end?

30:00.841 --> 30:02.832
There are many endings.

30:04.679 --> 30:05.964
Which is the right one?

30:06.681 --> 30:08.171
The one that you'll choose.

30:13.187 --> 30:14.222
(GROANS)

30:16.023 --> 30:17.354
(METAL TINKERING)

30:17.483 --> 30:18.518
Time to go?

30:19.235 --> 30:20.475
See you soon.

30:23.406 --> 30:24.486
(SNIFFLES)

30:25.157 --> 30:26.192
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

30:29.870 --> 30:32.361
Wow. You weren't kidding.

30:33.708 --> 30:35.039
Jennﬁer

30:35.751 --> 30:37.207
What's wrong?

30:38.212 --> 30:39.622
Are you okay?

30:39.714 --> 30:40.954
Listen,
there's no time to explain.

30:41.048 --> 30:43.585
If I told you I
needed you right now,

30:44.677 --> 30:45.883
would you help me?

30:48.389 --> 30:49.845
Have I ever said no to you?

30:51.017 --> 30:52.723
Self-preservation's
never been your thing.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.940
Oh, my God!
That is amazing!

31:07.241 --> 31:09.027
Again! Again!

31:11.203 --> 31:14.491
There is gonna be along line
for this one next year.

31:14.582 --> 31:18.541
Gotta be at least this tall,
no heart conditions
and definitely no preggers.

31:25.259 --> 31:26.419
Mother?

31:29.263 --> 31:30.878
Mother.
Mother.

31:30.973 --> 31:33.305
Mother.
Mother.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.265
Mother.
Mother.

31:36.312 --> 31:37.427
Mother.

32:00.795 --> 32:04.629
Hello, egg. I'm chicken.

32:08.010 --> 32:09.045
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

32:09.136 --> 32:11.127
Not too close,
or we'll both go boom.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.308
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

32:18.646 --> 32:21.308
May I have a moment
to myself, please?

32:35.621 --> 32:36.827
(DOOR OPENS)

32:38.124 --> 32:39.159
(DOOR CLOSES)

32:39.667 --> 32:41.328
Look how pretty I was.

32:43.337 --> 32:47.000
Today is
September 23rd, 2044?

32:49.510 --> 32:51.296
Day my cycle ends.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.301
But yours is just
rounding the big turn.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.344
The women out there,
they need a leader now.

33:02.898 --> 33:05.685
For years I've promised them
a holy resurrection.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.486
No. I can't.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.526
You can. You do.

33:18.873 --> 33:19.862
Listen to me.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.249
You are now
faced with a choice.

33:26.380 --> 33:31.420
There's a place far from here
where The Witness feels safe.

33:33.888 --> 33:35.003
Titan.
You've heard the name

33:35.097 --> 33:37.053
from the whispers
in your head.

33:38.559 --> 33:39.594
You know what's there.

33:40.728 --> 33:41.888
Death.

33:42.605 --> 33:45.722
Now the boys out there
are fighting
over that machine.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.891
Otter Eyes needs it
to save us all.

33:50.070 --> 33:52.231
Stop the paradox in 1957.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.697
But you, you have a choice.

33:57.578 --> 34:02.572
Spit in the face of death,
lead the others to Titan,

34:03.876 --> 34:09.621
navigate the storms,
and lead your Daughters
to face off against

34:09.757 --> 34:13.090
the Army of the 12 Monkeys
once and for all.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.381
Or?

34:20.601 --> 34:23.889
Or take them far,
far away from here

34:23.979 --> 34:26.095
in the hopes
that Cole succeeds

34:26.273 --> 34:28.309
and that one day
this war will be over.

34:31.278 --> 34:33.314
What'd you choose
when you were me?

34:34.782 --> 34:36.443
Not to go to Titan.

34:38.452 --> 34:41.444
I wasn't willing
to risk the lives
of my Daughters.

34:43.958 --> 34:46.950
But maybe if I was braver,

34:49.296 --> 34:51.287
I could've
helped save the world.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.128
But we're not brave.

34:56.136 --> 34:59.299
But you can be
a better me than I was.

35:00.641 --> 35:01.801
That's not possible.

35:03.435 --> 35:05.300
There are many endings.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.433
And the right one...

35:08.524 --> 35:10.515
Is the one you choose.

35:11.652 --> 35:12.767
Bingo.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.942
Choose your own adventure.
Choose your own adventure.

(SNORTING)

35:20.286 --> 35:21.321
(GROANS)

35:26.208 --> 35:27.664
I love you.

35:29.670 --> 35:32.537
I know that's
a really weird thing to hear.

35:34.133 --> 35:38.001
But later,
you'll need to remember that.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.305
Okay, egg.

35:45.519 --> 35:46.679
I'm dying now.

35:57.531 --> 35:58.520

(DOORS OPENING)

36:20.346 --> 36:21.711

36:22.514 --> 36:24.550
Can you lower your
weapons and stuff?

36:26.727 --> 36:28.012
Please?

36:29.563 --> 36:30.848
Do as she says.

36:43.744 --> 36:44.733
You.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.406
You need to get
ready to go back
and stop that paradox.

36:48.916 --> 36:50.076
Running out of time.

36:53.212 --> 36:55.749
Ramse, Cassie.

36:56.382 --> 36:57.918
You want The Witness?

37:00.052 --> 37:01.838
Let's go get the bastard.

37:01.929 --> 37:05.217
There is no time to
finish the calculations
for both splinters.

37:05.307 --> 37:08.515
We don't need this beast!
Do we, ladies?

37:08.602 --> 37:10.934
You want us to go overland?

37:12.564 --> 37:14.941
Do you even know
what's out there?

37:15.109 --> 37:17.441
You can't
navigate those storms.

37:18.987 --> 37:22.150
I got a yellow brick road
right here in my head, chief.

37:24.284 --> 37:25.319
Ladies,

37:26.954 --> 37:27.943
mount up.

37:31.458 --> 37:33.289
We're taking them to Titan.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.432
Let's go! Come on.

37:54.523 --> 37:56.559
The Witness has always been
one step ahead of us.

37:56.650 --> 37:58.151
He might be expecting
you guys, sojust...

37:58.318 --> 38:00.650
Yeah, I know. We know.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.484
Cassie.

38:14.710 --> 38:15.995
I'll see you soon.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.334
KATARINA: We're ready.

38:26.472 --> 38:29.384
I'm sending you
back for a full year.
Early 1957.

38:29.516 --> 38:32.349
It should give
you a head start
with The Messengers,

38:32.478 --> 38:37.268
and enough time
to find the Primary
and prevent the paradox.

38:37.357 --> 38:38.858
(THUNDERING)

38:40.360 --> 38:41.645
James!

38:44.031 --> 38:48.365
And ifyou don't,
we don't have
a machine to bring you back.

38:49.203 --> 38:50.818
(BOOMING)

38:53.665 --> 38:54.700
Thank you.

38:55.709 --> 38:56.698
For what?

38:57.586 --> 38:59.167
Believing in me.

40:04.987 --> 40:06.272
Katarina.

40:44.818 --> 40:45.807
(SCREAMS)

40:47.195 --> 40:48.321

No! No, Iwon't leave you!

41:04.671 --> 41:06.707
Hannah, please. Go.

41:07.674 --> 41:08.834
Go!

41:09.843 --> 41:10.958
Goodbye, Mother.

(CREAKING)

41:29.905 --> 41:31.020
(CRASHING)

42:29.715 --> 42:31.421
I don't want to
be afraid anymore.
