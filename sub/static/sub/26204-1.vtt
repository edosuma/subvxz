"It is humanity
hanging from a cross

00:13.346 --> 00:16.515
"of iron." said President
Eisenhower in his address to

00:16.516 --> 00:19.309
the American Society
of Newspaper Editors.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.771
Local soldier Lietenant Howard
Morganstine is returning from

00:22.772 --> 00:25.816
the front lines after being
critically injured in a grenade

00:25.817 --> 00:28.153
attack on the Korean Peninsula.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.273
Mrs. Claudia Morganstine
passed away

01:48.274 --> 01:51.026
at her home early Friday morning.
She is survived by

01:51.027 --> 01:53.987
her husband Howard and
daughters Milly and Katherine.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.199
Funeral services will be
held Monday afternoon at the

01:57.200 --> 02:00.869
Austin-Bell Funeral Home with a
wake immediately following at

02:00.870 --> 02:04.541
the home of the deceased.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.549
You poor dears.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.511
And a pretty little thing too.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.180
Such a tragedy.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.100
They'll never recover.

02:23.017 --> 02:26.980
History has a way of
repeating itself.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.986
Local debutante Milly
Morganstine to

02:33.987 --> 02:37.406
wed Gerald Goodman at high noon
today at the First Baptist

02:37.407 --> 02:39.825
Church. The couple has planned
a small but elegant church

02:39.826 --> 02:42.953
wedding followed by an intimate
reception for close family and

02:42.954 --> 02:46.350
friends at the Morganstine
home on Main Street.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.086
Thanks. Congratulations!

02:51.087 --> 02:52.380
Thank you.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.844
Smile for the camera!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.971
Hey, Kate, come here.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.642
Kate, I want you to
meet my cousin Peter.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.395
Peter just moved here. He'll
be a junior like you.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.396
Hi.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.439
It's a pleasure to meet you.

03:10.440 --> 03:11.691
Good to meet you too.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.084
So what do you think about Barry
Goldwater wanting to nuke

03:31.085 --> 03:31.920
Vietnam?

03:31.921 --> 03:34.922
Anything to end this
everlasting war.

03:34.923 --> 03:38.884
Can't we talk about something else?
It's a wedding for crying

03:38.885 --> 03:40.761
out loud.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.430
We're staying at the honeymoon
cottage at the Tradewind Motor

03:43.431 --> 03:44.182
Lodge.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.599
Sounds so dreamy.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.476
It is.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.020
Don't forget, Gerald, you
promised to stop by and fix the

03:50.021 --> 03:50.980
television.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.565
Surely the tv can wait
til after we get back?

03:53.566 --> 03:57.987
No, it's no big deal. We'll just
swing by and then be on our way.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.407
Don't worry, mother.
We'll get you fixed up.

04:03.952 --> 04:06.995
We're just living with her
until we can afford a place of

04:06.996 --> 04:08.748
our own.

04:09.165 --> 04:12.125
I don't see why that tv
is such an emergency.

04:12.126 --> 04:15.588
Well, you know how she
is with her soaps.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.012
Oh, thank you.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.851
I sure hope they know
what they're doing.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.146
Oh, my Milly... she's strong.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.942
So is that mother
in law of hers!

04:38.695 --> 04:40.446
Is that your dad?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.574
I heard he's a war hero.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.494
So you and Gerald are cousins?

04:47.370 --> 04:50.372
I'm gonna be a war hero too.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.833
I'm enlisting the moment I
graduate from high school.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.710
I hate war.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.671
Gather around girls.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.983
Found it. Just a
loose connection.

05:17.984 --> 05:21.487
Oh Charles! I love you.

05:22.488 --> 05:25.366
Now can we go on our honeymoon?

05:32.582 --> 05:36.084
That Peter seems like
a nice young man.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.211
He wants to be a soldier.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.839
Aint nothing wrong with being a soldier.
Your dad was a right

05:40.840 --> 05:42.151
fine one.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.676
Soldier or not, I ain't
the least bit interested.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.847
Baby girl, you don't
know what you want.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.602
Night, daddy.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.395
Night? It's still daylight.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.605
I'm not feeling well.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.023
Alright. Love you.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.024
Love you too.

06:18.503 --> 06:21.713
Maybe I should backpack
across the country.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.840
Is that what you wanna do?

06:23.841 --> 06:25.259
Maybe.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.012
You think you'll ever
wanna settle down?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.392
Nope.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.769
They're needing more
soldiers, you know.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.147
Haven't you gotten that
out of your system?

06:38.523 --> 06:40.649
I'm not talking a career,
but just a tour.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.111
Peter Baxter, if you enlist, I'm
never speaking to you again.

06:43.611 --> 06:44.529
You don't mean that.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.530
Try me.

06:46.572 --> 06:48.616
C'mon, I'm not doing
anything just yet.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.349
Okay.

07:15.935 --> 07:18.687
You win. I'll go
to college first.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.356
That's perfect! Then the war
will be over by the time you

07:21.357 --> 07:23.651
get out!

07:24.694 --> 07:25.987
Good night, Kate.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.603
We live in an uncertain world.

07:59.604 --> 08:04.441
Your classmates a few years ago
were concerned with going to

08:04.442 --> 08:09.947
college, getting jobs,
getting married.

08:10.072 --> 08:15.994
But you, Class of '65...
you're different.

08:15.995 --> 08:20.999
You young men are wondering
when you'll be called to serve

08:21.000 --> 08:26.398
your country... whether
you'll be send to the front.

08:26.422 --> 08:30.550
What will it be like
to engage in battle?

08:30.551 --> 08:35.847
And you young ladies are afraid
that your sweethearts will be

08:35.847 --> 08:40.684
sent away. And if they leave,
they won't return. And if they

08:40.686 --> 08:46.502
do return, will things
ever be the same?

08:46.526 --> 08:51.404
A quarter of a century ago, I
was sitting right where you are

08:51.405 --> 08:57.536
today. Fearful of the future,
convinced that life as I knew

08:57.537 --> 09:01.831
it would never be the same
if I went away to war.

09:01.832 --> 09:07.921
I was right. Once war enters
your life, you're never the

09:07.922 --> 09:09.506
same.

09:09.507 --> 09:16.930
Decades later, memories linger,
and the effects of war remain.

09:16.931 --> 09:23.603
Yes, I've seen the devastation
that war can bring. But I've

09:23.604 --> 09:26.917
got good news for you.

09:26.941 --> 09:34.364
Devastation can lead to revelation.
When you think that

09:34.365 --> 09:39.411
you are going to break, but you don't.
When you've been beat

09:39.412 --> 09:44.124
down so low that there's no
where else to look but up.

09:44.125 --> 09:48.855
It's during those times that God
can give you a strength that you

09:48.879 --> 09:50.880
didn't know that you had.

09:50.881 --> 09:55.218
A strength that will not only
see you through the bitter

09:55.219 --> 10:01.368
times, but it will make the
future joys that much sweeter.

10:01.392 --> 10:09.392
So to you, Class of '65, I
challenge you to hasten in to

10:10.735 --> 10:18.533
that unknown future with that strength...
wisdom... and an

10:18.534 --> 10:26.166
understanding that God is
always bigger than whatever you

10:26.167 --> 10:30.588
may fear. May God bless you.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.681
Congratulations, Katherine.

10:41.682 --> 10:44.185
It's Kate, Aunt Thalia.
Not Katherine.

10:48.105 --> 10:52.902
I should be filming this.
I'm getting my camera.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.988
So proud of you, sis.

11:00.660 --> 11:01.910
Ew.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.703
You look lovely.
Isn't she, daddy?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.748
Yes, beautiful.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.125
I'm outta here. Bye.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.631
Kate, you can't run
around barefoot.

11:14.590 --> 11:17.008
You know I never interfere
in your affairs.

11:17.009 --> 11:20.553
And I appreciate that. She's
just running from love and when

11:20.554 --> 11:24.016
it finally catches up
with her she'll be fine.

11:26.143 --> 11:31.708
Do you think I've invested my
time into you to have nothing?

11:31.732 --> 11:34.109
Peter's still talking
about enlisting.

11:34.110 --> 11:34.902
Still?

11:34.902 --> 11:35.695
Ouch.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.823
Sorry. What about college?

11:39.657 --> 11:42.283
Apparently going to college
has only made it worse.

11:42.284 --> 11:46.139
Said he feels like
he's wasting his time.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.290
Still thinks he's going to be
some kind of war hero. Like

11:49.291 --> 11:50.543
anyone cares.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.715
We're praying Gerald doesn't
get drafted, but I dunno.

11:56.674 --> 11:59.342
He can't work at the factory
forever, but no one will hire

11:59.343 --> 12:01.220
him until he's done his service

12:04.765 --> 12:06.976
I appreciate you
doing this for me.

12:08.102 --> 12:12.021
None of my old clothes seem to fit anymore.
I'm afraid...

12:12.022 --> 12:14.150
Really? What does Gerald think?

12:14.775 --> 12:17.694
He doesn't know...

12:17.695 --> 12:19.738
and I'm waiting to hear back
from the doctor. It should be

12:19.739 --> 12:21.007
any day now.

12:21.031 --> 12:23.908
At this rate we're going to be
living with Joanna the rest of

12:23.909 --> 12:25.160
our lives.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.079
Maybe not.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.297
I got it!

12:40.092 --> 12:41.092
Hello.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.302
Is it for me?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.303
No.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.181
Yes, this is she.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.517
Yes.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.854
Thank you.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.111
Are you?

12:59.904 --> 13:00.988
Who called?

13:07.995 --> 13:11.415
I bet it was Gerald. She
never lets me talk to him.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.795
I'll go call him and
see what he needed.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.828
It was nice of your
mother to babysit.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.830
See. She's not all bad.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.374
Well...

14:09.181 --> 14:10.181
Gerald, I...

14:10.182 --> 14:11.451
There's something...

14:11.475 --> 14:12.518
You first.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.936
You first.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.313
Go ahead.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.538
You know I've been searching for
a better job for a long time

14:33.539 --> 14:34.248
now.

14:34.249 --> 14:35.541
Yes.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.673
No one will hire me until I'm
finished with my service.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.016
So I decided to
enlist this morning.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.319
Okay.

15:04.945 --> 15:08.656
You know I hate to do
this to you, and Tommy...

15:08.657 --> 15:11.535
And mother will be home to...

15:19.251 --> 15:21.587
What was it you
were gonna tell me?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.971
I'm Pregnant.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.611
I didn't think
you'd be so upset.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.656
All I'm saying is one would
expect a decision like this to

15:49.657 --> 15:52.743
be mutual agreement, Something
we talked about together.

15:56.121 --> 15:59.792
I do declare, Mama Sooze, you
make the best biscuits in town.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.255
Lemme have one of those.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.548
Thank you.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.508
I remember the day I enlisted.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.969
Not now, daddy.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.805
Must he always sit in your lap
at the table instead of in his

16:13.806 --> 16:14.807
chair?

16:19.061 --> 16:21.122
It's not like I
really had a choice.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.524
You could've held out
til you turned 26.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.734
Honey, that's another
year and a half.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.195
What's your mother say?

16:30.447 --> 16:31.865
I haven't told her yet.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.034
Some fine son you are!

16:35.035 --> 16:36.537
That's enough, Thalia.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.333
Did you tell them?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.377
Tell us what?

16:43.836 --> 16:46.547
We're serving together
on the USS Forrestal.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.413
What about college?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.124
I can always go back.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.626
What about me?

17:25.961 --> 17:27.838
What about you?

17:30.799 --> 17:32.801
You know how I feel.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.847
And you know how I feel.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.561
I'm sorry, it's
something I have to do.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.547
Sorry about Peter.

18:11.173 --> 18:14.300
Leastwise he'll be on a carrier.
They say that's the safest

18:14.301 --> 18:16.595
place to be in war.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.766
He could be in the
jungles for all I care.

18:22.684 --> 18:26.562
Did you know the USS Forrestal
is the first super carrier of

18:26.563 --> 18:31.359
its kind? If she were stood on
end she'd reach the 80th floor

18:31.360 --> 18:34.404
of the Empire State Building.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.869
Don't throw it away.
I'll darn it.

18:42.162 --> 18:45.706
And why did they say that? It's
not like anyone ever stands a

18:45.707 --> 18:48.394
ship on end.

18:48.418 --> 18:52.547
Well... still, sitting in the
water, she's as tall as a 25

18:52.548 --> 18:59.805
story building. She's the Navy's
crowning glory... pride and joy.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.849
She's unstoppable.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.394
Sounds like the Titanic.

19:46.768 --> 19:51.190
It's just gonna be one tour.
I'll be back before you know it.

19:52.733 --> 19:57.486
What if you're not? Have
you thought about that?

19:57.487 --> 19:59.239
Well let's not think about it.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.741
It's easy for you to say.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.410
You're off cruising the world on
your super carrier and I'm stuck

20:04.411 --> 20:05.889
here with your mother.

20:05.913 --> 20:09.750
Gerald? Can you help m get
the bags out of the car?

20:10.500 --> 20:12.169
Coming.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.014
What time you shippin'
out tomorrow?

20:24.890 --> 20:27.184
Eight. Same as Gerald.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.651
I'd better go spend
time with my family.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.529
Will you write me?

20:42.282 --> 20:45.452
A local soldier was
killed today when...

20:46.703 --> 20:47.704
I'd better get going.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.419
Take care.

21:15.983 --> 21:20.696
Alright. Give me a smile, Tommy.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.203
Alright, if we're gonna have
that silly thing, let's get

21:29.204 --> 21:30.204
some of you.

21:30.205 --> 21:31.206
Alright.

21:31.748 --> 21:34.418
Alright, I'll swap you.
Come here, big guy.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.545
It's that little button
right on the front.

21:36.546 --> 21:37.546
Ok.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.508
Can you salute like daddy?

21:42.718 --> 21:43.718
And smile. Right here.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.639
Are we not happy?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.348
Here, let me get
some of you two.

21:49.349 --> 21:50.017
Ok.

21:50.018 --> 21:51.810
Oh good, thanks, Kate.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.651
What is it?

22:02.112 --> 22:05.782
It's not too late. We can
burn the papers, you know.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.578
I wasn't drafted, mother.
I enlisted.

22:10.329 --> 22:14.206
Well then we can plead insanity
because it runs in the family.

22:14.207 --> 22:17.543
Like I told Milly, I'll be
back before you know it.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.920
Now boarding east bound train.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.631
That's my train.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.481
I love you.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.195
I love you too, little one.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.156
I'll make it back.

22:47.157 --> 22:51.119
My baby. Precious baby.

23:27.072 --> 23:31.367
I want you to read this every night.
The Navy can be a rough

23:31.368 --> 23:33.203
place.

23:33.829 --> 23:36.831
Wait! Don't forget this.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.166
Thanks, Kate.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.670
It doesn't mean you have to
start cussing, gambling, and

23:42.671 --> 23:43.898
smoking.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.507
God sees you, even in Vietnam.

23:46.508 --> 23:47.843
Grand Mere.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.721
Proud of you, son.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.723
Thank you.

23:59.938 --> 24:03.482
End the war! End the war!
End the war!

24:03.483 --> 24:04.985
Bye, Peter.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.750
Oh, Richard. How will I
survive without you?

24:21.793 --> 24:23.044
You must be strong.

24:23.503 --> 24:28.007
Strong... how can I be strong?
When my whole world's falling

24:28.008 --> 24:29.342
apart?

24:38.810 --> 24:41.520
Gerald gave this to me.

24:41.521 --> 24:45.317
He obviously didn't put much
thought into it. It's plastic.

24:48.945 --> 24:52.157
You know Charles
means nothing to me.

24:55.702 --> 25:00.207
Yes I do, and a shame too.
He's not a bad guy.

25:11.384 --> 25:15.179
Why do boys always have
to be so frustrating?

25:15.180 --> 25:17.891
Don't suppose they're
always frustrating.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.726
You have a boyfriend?

25:21.937 --> 25:26.042
Not yet. But I pray everyday
that God would send me someone

25:26.066 --> 25:27.400
special.

25:28.151 --> 25:30.612
I think I'd find something
else to pray for.

25:39.246 --> 25:44.042
Dear Jesus... It's me...
Ruby Mae.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.212
I'm worried about Miss Kate.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.883
Can you watch over her? Miss
Milly too, while you're at it.

25:52.259 --> 25:54.928
And of course their
young men off fightin'.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.139
And, dear Jesus,

25:58.557 --> 26:02.310
if it ain't too much trouble I
sure would like a man of my own.

26:06.064 --> 26:11.151
Um... I don't require much.
Don't have to sweep me off my

26:11.152 --> 26:16.031
feet or nothing. Just a good man to love.
And who will love

26:16.032 --> 26:17.218
me.

26:21.788 --> 26:26.585
I know. I know. All
in your timing.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.881
I love you. Amen.

26:53.403 --> 26:54.738
What happened?

26:55.572 --> 26:57.073
Are you hurt?

26:58.658 --> 26:59.868
Wait here.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.554
I can't believe you filled
your sock with ice.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.016
I'm Reggie, the new
church janitor.

27:23.183 --> 27:26.061
Ruby Mae - the clutz.

27:27.812 --> 27:31.690
So uh... you come
around here much?

27:31.691 --> 27:33.610
Every chance I get.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.365
I'm a maid.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.581
The swellings going down.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.796
Oh wait, wait, wait, wait.
Put your weight on me.

27:54.964 --> 27:56.424
It's better.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.094
How bout we get you home?

28:00.387 --> 28:02.138
That'd be nice.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.662
If I'm not back when the timer
goes off, could you check the

28:26.663 --> 28:28.623
cookies? They're for Gerald.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.376
I guess.

28:42.637 --> 28:47.182
27 more American
lives lost as the US

28:47.183 --> 28:50.060
continues with Operation
Junction City, the largest US

28:50.061 --> 28:52.123
military offensive of
the Vietnam War so...

29:14.502 --> 29:16.379
Those were for Gerald.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.924
They weren't fit for my Gerald.
They're not even the kind that

29:20.925 --> 29:22.302
he likes.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.264
No, I'll bake him
some this afternoon.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.361
What's the cow say?

29:42.071 --> 29:45.575
I've tried to get along with her.
Lord knows, I have.

29:47.368 --> 29:48.870
There is no pleasing her.

29:53.166 --> 29:55.876
I don't know how Gerald has
gotten along with her all these

29:55.877 --> 29:57.921
years. But not me.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.722
We are going to go stay with
Aunt Kate and Grandpa. What do

30:08.723 --> 30:09.724
ya think of that?

30:12.101 --> 30:16.815
Well land sakes, what have we here?
Miss Thalia? Miss Kate?

30:19.067 --> 30:22.820
I knew you wouldn't last long
with that woman. She is the

30:22.821 --> 30:24.239
devil herself.

30:25.865 --> 30:29.327
This is going to be fun Being
roommates with Kate again.

30:33.790 --> 30:34.958
Where is Kate?

30:35.291 --> 30:38.795
No tellin'. She don't spend
much time around here nowadays.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.048
Wonder where she's hanging out..

31:01.860 --> 31:03.319
Did I miss something?

31:04.028 --> 31:08.032
Sorry about that. We get
to be roomies again.

31:08.908 --> 31:09.909
Okay...

31:12.078 --> 31:15.665
Won't this be fun? Be
just like old times.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.001
Uh huh...

31:18.334 --> 31:20.794
Oh, it's Mr. MacDougal. I need
to let him know to forward my

31:20.795 --> 31:22.046
mail.

33:07.235 --> 33:11.114
Blessed are the peacemakers, for
they will inherit the earth.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.157
Are you a peacemaker?

33:13.491 --> 33:14.951
I'm against war.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.162
Peace is the only
war worth waging.

33:20.832 --> 33:26.629
I'm Celeste. This is Cool Breeze
and that's Storm on drums.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.507
I'm Kate.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.217
Welcome.

33:38.933 --> 33:42.477
Tell your mama, thanks for those
pies she brought over yesterday.

33:42.478 --> 33:45.773
She's here, she had nursery
duty this morning.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.234
Hey there.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.028
Hey.

33:51.029 --> 33:57.576
I, uh, came in late.
Had to mop up a spill.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.748
I was hoping to sit
with you today.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.584
That would've been nice.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.377
Uh, you headed home?

34:07.378 --> 34:08.880
Mmhmm.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.716
Mind if I walk ya home?

34:12.507 --> 34:13.926
Okay.

34:16.596 --> 34:20.264
You, uh, going to
decoration day next week?

34:20.266 --> 34:21.266
Mmhmm.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.728
You don't talk much, do you?

34:25.103 --> 34:27.315
What do ya want to talk about?

34:33.571 --> 34:39.367
Miss Milly! I declare, you
take for most packages.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.703
Course, I remember my days on
the battleline and my little

34:41.704 --> 34:43.806
lady send me goodies.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.583
Feelin' lower than a caterpillar
and then I'd get one of her

34:46.583 --> 34:50.462
packages. She made the best
peanut butter tea cakes. They'd

34:50.463 --> 34:55.152
plum melt in your mouth.
All the fellows would...

34:55.176 --> 34:58.178
But I expect you're more
interested in a package of your

34:58.179 --> 35:00.348
own than hearing
about my tea cakes.

35:01.057 --> 35:02.350
Thank you.

35:08.064 --> 35:13.236
War is mighty lonely.
Whatever front you're on.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.196
I'm sorry, what did you say?

35:16.197 --> 35:18.949
Don't you fret your pretty
little head about it, Mrs.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.368
Goodman. You just go right on,
read those sweet nothings from

35:21.369 --> 35:22.745
your man.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.709
Righteous jam, man.

36:14.881 --> 36:17.799
Ladies.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.843
Hey.

36:20.219 --> 36:24.472
Hey, I'm Van. Van the Man.

36:24.473 --> 36:26.975
Are you new to this scene?

36:26.976 --> 36:28.311
Not really.

36:28.853 --> 36:29.854
Right on.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.771
Righteous song.

36:31.772 --> 36:32.899
Groovy.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.859
I'm sorry, I never
caught your name.

36:35.860 --> 36:36.819
Kate.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.113
Kate, that's a beautiful name.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.451
I should probably get going.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.888
Yeah, yeah.

36:45.912 --> 36:47.413
Do you need a lift?

36:48.456 --> 36:49.415
Sure.

36:49.416 --> 36:50.708
Right on.

36:53.920 --> 36:57.005
So, tell me about
yourself, Kate.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.215
Not much to tell.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.217
Oh yeah?

37:00.218 --> 37:02.385
So you protesting tomorrow?

37:02.386 --> 37:03.887
Protesting?

37:03.888 --> 37:06.265
Oh, man, it's gonna be a gas.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.351
Why not?

37:09.352 --> 37:11.270
"Why not?" I dig that.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.898
Well, I gotta split. So
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

37:14.899 --> 37:15.483
Sure.

37:15.484 --> 37:16.484
Right on.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.113
See ya.

37:22.114 --> 37:23.115
See ya.

37:39.465 --> 37:40.507
Who was that?

37:40.508 --> 37:41.508
A friend.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.674
Hey, you got a letter from
Peter there on the table.

38:29.807 --> 38:31.808
A guy honks and you go running?

38:31.809 --> 38:34.186
Welcome to the
swinging sixities!

38:36.480 --> 38:38.690
The latest Gallup poll of US

38:38.691 --> 38:41.651
students revealed their
stance on the Vietnam War.

38:41.652 --> 38:45.822
When some 49% identified
themselves as hawks

38:45.823 --> 38:48.783
35% identified as doves.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.785
Let's ride.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.162
As soon as you finish that you
can have the rest of the day

38:52.163 --> 38:53.204
off for the holiday.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.205
Yes, ma'am.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.915
American Forces
intercepted north

38:55.916 --> 38:59.210
Vietnamese units moving
in from Cambodia.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.463
Early reports are casualties...

39:01.464 --> 39:02.964
Howard. It's time to go.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.257
Okay.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.260
Milly, you ready?

39:07.553 --> 39:08.637
Coming!

39:13.476 --> 39:15.770
Take your pick.

39:23.986 --> 39:30.533
Everybody gather 'round. Okay, fat cats.
Cool your chops.

39:30.534 --> 39:32.703
Ya'll know the routine.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.456
Now we here to take
care of business.

39:35.790 --> 39:41.628
And when Johnny Law shows up?
We got to split. Ya'll dig me?

39:41.629 --> 39:44.256
Let's roll, let's roll.

39:44.507 --> 39:45.883
Let's go, guys.

39:49.845 --> 39:54.141
Freedom, everybody, freedom.
This is how it all begins.

40:31.929 --> 40:36.349
On this Memorial Day 1967 we pay
tribute to the brave men and

40:36.350 --> 40:40.103
women who have served and
continue to serve in their fight

40:40.104 --> 40:41.354
for freedom.

40:41.355 --> 40:44.107
We owe them a debt far greater
than anything we could ever

40:44.108 --> 40:45.109
repay.

40:45.317 --> 40:48.778
Across the world, our young
soldiers are fighting, suffering

40:48.779 --> 40:51.906
and, yes, dying, so that other
young men and women are

40:51.907 --> 40:54.618
free to pursue their
own opportunties.

40:55.369 --> 40:58.621
No one likes war. But we
must have those who will

40:58.622 --> 41:01.708
accept war in order
to end the war.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.003
To those who sacrifice their
own personal happiness

41:05.004 --> 41:07.524
for the happiness of others.
Who offer up their own lives

41:07.548 --> 41:10.258
in order to save other lives.

41:10.259 --> 41:14.013
We offer our humblest of thanks.
Let us pray.

41:15.723 --> 41:18.100
Our Father, we come to you
today thanking you for your

41:18.225 --> 41:20.393
ultimate sacrifice
and undeservd love.

41:20.394 --> 41:24.272
For your wisdom and direction,
for your steadfast faithfulness,

41:24.273 --> 41:27.066
for your rays of hope
in the darkest of days,

41:27.067 --> 41:30.070
we give you thanks. Amen.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.927
Katherine Louise Morganstine!

42:03.312 --> 42:07.918
Howard, that girl has
embarassed the entire family.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.275
She's young.

42:09.276 --> 42:11.444
She's old enough to know better

42:11.445 --> 42:13.905
Just give her time.
She'll be fine.

42:13.906 --> 42:17.243
Well... I hope you know
what you're doing.

42:18.327 --> 42:20.955
C'mon Tommy. It's
time for your nap.

42:25.668 --> 42:26.668
You okay, daddy?

42:26.669 --> 42:27.669
Yeah.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.753
She's just scared.

42:28.754 --> 42:29.755
I know.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.136
Hey, beautiful.

43:19.930 --> 43:24.435
The way you holdin' them flowers
make you look like a bride.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.923
The thing I like
about westerns...

43:57.176 --> 44:01.638
you know exactly who the good
guys are and who the bad guys

44:01.639 --> 44:07.912
are. But war, honey, is
not quio black and white.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.103
Daddy...

44:09.104 --> 44:12.983
Katie... I know
you'll find your way.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.214
Milly. Telephone.

44:37.883 --> 44:39.385
Milly!

44:41.095 --> 44:43.305
Milly, it's Gerald!

44:51.522 --> 44:52.690
Everything okay?

44:53.941 --> 44:56.443
Morning, babe. Did I wake you?

44:57.277 --> 44:58.277
Where are you?

44:58.278 --> 44:59.737
Virigin Islands.

44:59.738 --> 45:00.989
Hey, baby.

45:01.699 --> 45:02.950
What you doin'?

45:05.244 --> 45:07.495
Hey, do you mind? Real quick.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.414
Yeah, man, don't flip your lid.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.708
Hey, sorry about that.

45:11.417 --> 45:12.793
You doing okay?

45:13.252 --> 45:17.255
Can't complain. Hey, do you
remember Harvey Krudel from

45:17.256 --> 45:21.467
school? He was a couple
years ahead of us. He's

45:21.468 --> 45:22.468
in the rack across from me.

45:22.469 --> 45:23.678
What about Peter?

45:23.679 --> 45:28.599
Um, I don't get to see him much
He's, uh, in another shift.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.395
Hey, man, are you gonna
be done with that soon?

45:32.896 --> 45:34.648
Hey, I'd better go.

45:35.190 --> 45:36.400
I miss you.

45:37.401 --> 45:38.526
I miss you too.

45:38.527 --> 45:39.527
Bye.

45:39.528 --> 45:40.529
Bye.

45:58.505 --> 46:00.090
What do you think of the movie?

46:00.841 --> 46:02.217
It was okay.

46:04.720 --> 46:06.513
I enjoyed the company.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.937
I prayed for someone like you.

46:15.856 --> 46:17.274
Me too.

46:21.779 --> 46:27.910
I've been think about the future.
You, me...

46:29.703 --> 46:31.579
American forces
intercepted north

46:31.580 --> 46:33.582
Vietnamese units moving
in from Cambodia.

46:34.249 --> 46:35.584
And Uncle Sam.

46:48.639 --> 46:50.390
I know we haven't known
each other long.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.643
But I feel like I've
known you all my life.

46:53.644 --> 46:54.812
Me too.

47:01.276 --> 47:02.528
I got my notice.

47:05.155 --> 47:06.156
Draft?

47:10.911 --> 47:12.955
I ship out in two weeks.

47:21.588 --> 47:23.674
Would you think I was crazy...

47:25.092 --> 47:27.302
if I asked you to marry me?

47:31.598 --> 47:33.432
It was my Grammy's.

47:33.433 --> 47:35.101
I know it's not much.

47:35.102 --> 47:39.648
But I'd be honored,
if'n you'd wear it.

47:48.198 --> 47:51.660
You just made me the
happiest man alive.

47:58.333 --> 48:01.669
Marriage is a
sacred institution.

48:01.670 --> 48:03.921
Not to be entered into lightly.

48:03.922 --> 48:08.342
It's a commitment between two
imperfect people longing for a

48:08.343 --> 48:10.012
perfect love.

48:10.512 --> 48:15.893
Reginald, do you take Ruby
Mae to be your wedded wife?

48:17.561 --> 48:18.937
I do.

48:20.480 --> 48:24.984
Ruby Mae, do you take
Reginald to be your wedding

48:24.985 --> 48:29.757
husband, to have, and to
hold, from this day forward?

48:29.781 --> 48:30.782
I do.

48:34.411 --> 48:38.916
For better, for worse.
For rich for poorer.

48:44.588 --> 48:47.883
In sickness, and in health.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.510
But I pray everyday that
God would send me someone

48:51.511 --> 48:52.512
special.

48:58.852 --> 49:02.022
To love, and to cherish.

49:12.658 --> 49:16.411
I now pronounce you
husband, and wife.

49:16.954 --> 49:19.998
You may kiss your bride.

49:24.294 --> 49:25.587
Whatchu doin' out here?

49:27.547 --> 49:30.342
You're not going out with that
hippie fellow again, are you?

49:30.926 --> 49:32.511
He's not so bad.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.513
He's no Peter.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.766
He hates war as much as I do.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.111
How long are you
gonna keep running?

49:51.321 --> 49:52.948
As long as it takes.

49:54.574 --> 49:56.868
You're not... mom.

49:59.371 --> 50:03.184
Maybe not. But who's to say I
wouldn't make the same choice?

50:10.132 --> 50:11.800
Who's to say you wouldn't?

50:38.326 --> 50:40.787
That's disgusting, man.

50:43.123 --> 50:44.290
What?

50:44.291 --> 50:45.292
Them!

50:46.460 --> 50:48.711
They all act like they're
a bunch of heros

50:48.712 --> 50:50.130
or something.

50:50.881 --> 50:54.300
But they're all just a
bunch of babykillers.

50:54.301 --> 50:55.677
You know?

50:57.429 --> 50:58.846
Babykillers?

50:58.847 --> 51:04.101
Yeah. It's not even a real war!

51:04.102 --> 51:06.896
Just America picking on the
Vietnamese, killing their

51:06.897 --> 51:07.897
children.

51:09.941 --> 51:14.780
I'm about to go show them just how I feel.
Right now. C'mon.

51:18.450 --> 51:20.494
You make me sick.

51:21.078 --> 51:22.537
Van!

51:22.871 --> 51:24.246
What are you doing?

51:24.247 --> 51:25.540
You comin'?

51:27.292 --> 51:28.751
I'm so sorry.

51:28.752 --> 51:31.712
It's not the first time.
Won't be the last.

51:31.713 --> 51:36.093
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

51:55.112 --> 51:59.323
It don't seem right that we got
to be separated and we just

51:59.324 --> 52:01.118
found each other.

52:01.493 --> 52:02.786
I know.

52:04.621 --> 52:11.545
But whatever happens, we'll
always have this time together.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.820
C'mon. It's getting chilly.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.262
Don't go!

52:22.889 --> 52:26.935
It's gonna be an early morning
catchin' the bus before daybrea.

53:06.433 --> 53:08.767
So, have you heard from Gerald?

53:08.768 --> 53:11.188
Not since he crossed
the equater.

53:12.772 --> 53:14.566
Oh.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.525
What?

53:16.526 --> 53:17.985
It's nothing.

53:17.986 --> 53:20.404
Marvin just told me about the
whole crossing the equater

53:20.405 --> 53:23.259
tradition. Sounds rough, but...

53:23.283 --> 53:27.704
Um, Clyde Pitman is back.
At Veteran's Hospital.

53:29.581 --> 53:32.709
He lost his arm. The left one.

53:37.005 --> 53:40.549
What's it like being
a candy striper?

53:40.550 --> 53:42.052
You interested?

53:43.970 --> 53:45.430
Maybe.

54:06.117 --> 54:09.453
Where is everyone? It's
not like it's for me.

54:09.454 --> 54:11.790
Okay, Mommy will be right back.

54:16.878 --> 54:18.838
I'll be right back.

54:22.634 --> 54:23.634
Hello.

54:23.635 --> 54:25.178
Hey there, beautiful.

54:25.804 --> 54:26.930
Gerald?

54:27.597 --> 54:29.808
[{GERALD] You have other
men calling you beautiful?

54:30.308 --> 54:33.395
It's so good to hear your voice!
How are you doing?

54:33.937 --> 54:35.062
Better now.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.690
Where are you?

54:38.650 --> 54:40.110
The Philippines.

54:41.111 --> 54:44.989
Last leg of the journey, then
it's to Yankee Station, off the

54:44.990 --> 54:46.532
coast of 'Nam.

54:46.533 --> 54:47.951
You doin' okay?

54:50.120 --> 54:51.746
You there?

54:55.875 --> 54:58.002
We lost Harvey Krudel.

54:58.003 --> 54:59.296
How?

55:01.423 --> 55:04.676
Got swept over the side.
Went overboard.

55:08.638 --> 55:12.516
Um, good news, though. I got
assigned to the engine room

55:12.517 --> 55:14.352
so no risk of that for me.

55:16.563 --> 55:18.440
I'm deep within the
bowels of the ship.

55:24.738 --> 55:27.198
I want you to know...

55:28.033 --> 55:31.744
whatever happens, don't
lose your faith.

55:31.745 --> 55:36.290
I'm where I'm supposed to be,
doing what I'm supposed to

55:36.291 --> 55:41.004
be doing. Some of the
younger guys, they're...

55:43.006 --> 55:44.674
Well...

55:45.800 --> 55:48.511
Just don't lose your faith.

55:51.014 --> 55:52.807
I love you.

55:55.143 --> 55:56.770
I love you, too.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.608
Give Tommy my love.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.446
Bye.

56:06.946 --> 56:08.490
Bye.

56:31.554 --> 56:33.056
That Gerald?

56:34.516 --> 56:35.975
How's he doin'?

56:40.021 --> 56:42.107
You really doing this?

56:43.483 --> 56:44.984
Good for you.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.663
How was it?

56:57.330 --> 56:59.790
Not much different than
taking care of daddy.

56:59.791 --> 57:04.545
Except, most of these guys are young.
Some of them younger than

57:04.546 --> 57:08.883
me. But it felt good to help.

57:09.509 --> 57:11.136
Who's winning?

57:12.137 --> 57:14.139
No one, right now.

57:34.075 --> 57:36.994
Excuse me, I was told that I
could find a Mrs. Reginald Owens

57:36.995 --> 57:38.620
here?

57:38.621 --> 57:40.331
I'm Mrs. Owens.

57:43.501 --> 57:46.212
Here, ma'am. I'm sorry.

57:55.597 --> 57:57.432
Aren't you gonna open it?

58:07.567 --> 58:10.986
We regret to inform you that
your husband Reginald Owens has

58:10.987 --> 58:15.909
been listed as missing in action
following a helicopter crash.

58:18.578 --> 58:21.080
'Scuse me. Tell your
aunt I had to go.

58:46.773 --> 58:48.775
Worrying about Gerald?

58:49.192 --> 58:51.528
Every minute of the
day and night.

58:54.531 --> 58:59.243
It's like there's a hole in my
heart and every day it gets a

58:59.244 --> 59:00.662
little bigger.

59:02.997 --> 59:08.919
Sometimes I just wonder if one
day I'll wake up and it will

59:08.920 --> 59:11.672
have taken over my heart and
they'll be nothing left but this

59:11.673 --> 59:14.509
big gaping hole.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.470
And then what happens?

59:21.266 --> 59:24.519
You think that's what
happened to mom?

59:25.186 --> 59:27.062
I don't know.

59:27.063 --> 59:30.065
I used to think mom killed
herself because she couldn't

59:30.066 --> 59:34.237
handle seeing daddy hurt.
Now I don't know.

59:35.989 --> 59:39.033
Daddy says war makes you
look at things differently.

59:39.951 --> 59:41.703
That it does.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.790
Ready for your baby shower?

59:46.791 --> 59:48.251
Yes.

59:49.752 --> 59:51.796
We could use some fun.

59:53.548 --> 59:54.549
C'mon.

59:55.008 --> 59:58.303
Let's go see if there's any of
Mama Souze's pecan pie left.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.816
Goodness, Nancy, you
did a good job!

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:18.281
Thank you, Nancy.
It's beautiful.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.456
It's from me.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:34.255
It's Gerald's Baby Book. I
thought you would like it.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:42.722
Thank you, Joanna... I do.

01:00:51.272 --> 01:00:55.169
I can't believe, in another
month, Baby Goodman makes his,

01:00:55.193 --> 01:00:57.152
or her, appearance.

01:00:57.153 --> 01:01:01.823
Oh, it's going to be a girl.
I can tell from how you're

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.552
carrying.

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:07.454
Well, she has been craving
sweets lately, so you might just

01:01:07.455 --> 01:01:08.974
be right!

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:11.167
Anybody need any more food?

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:20.384
Oh, your poor dad. Being stuck
with a gaggle of girls in the

01:01:20.385 --> 01:01:21.844
house.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:24.263
I'll go check on him.

01:01:29.769 --> 01:01:31.688
Daddy? You hungry?

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:37.276
Daddy?

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:39.986
Daddy? Daddy, what's wrong?

01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:42.447
Milly? Milly, something's
wrong with Daddy!

01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:43.783
Daddy, look at me.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:50.498
Daddy, are you okay? Daddy,
what's wrong? Daddy?

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.629
Milly, it's the Forestall.

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:03.428
No. No. This can't be happening.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:11.727
It's all your fault. If you had
been a better wife, Gerald would

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.355
have never enlisted.

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:21.362
He's my baby. He's
my precious baby!

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.663
She didn't mean it.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:35.917
It's a big ship. At least you
said he was in the engine room.

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:37.670
He should be safe there.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:42.425
I hope Peter's okay.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:48.681
Kate...

01:02:54.771 --> 01:03:00.984
The Lord is my shepard. I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:06.031
down in green pastures. He
leadeth me beside still waters.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:10.744
He restoreth my soul. He
leadeth me in the paths

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:14.516
of righteousness.
For his name sake.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:17.209
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:23.150
of death. I will fear no evil..
Thou art with me.

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:26.051
Thy rod and they staff
- they comfort me.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:31.848
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of my enemies.

01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:34.351
Thou annointest
my head with oil.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.686
My cup runneth over.

01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.897
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow me.

01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:44.569
All the days of my life. And I
will dwell in the house of the

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:47.966
Lord forever. Let the
church say "Amen".

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:49.074
Amen!

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:51.535
Let the church say "Amen" again.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:53.037
Hallelujah.

01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:57.583
Amen.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.876
27 more American lives lost...

01:03:59.877 --> 01:04:01.127
Any news?

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:02.463
No, honey.

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:07.676
Aunt Thalia? Where are
those letters from Peter?

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.721
Right where I left
them on that table.

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.348
They're not here.

01:04:13.641 --> 01:04:15.058
Of course they're here.

01:04:15.059 --> 01:04:17.353
They're not here.

01:04:20.439 --> 01:04:22.066
Goodness!

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.864
Have either of you seen
Kate's letters from Peter?

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.868
They're in our room on
that table by the dresser.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.232
Why didn't I read these before?

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:09.946
Sometimes you just don't
appreciate what you have until..

01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:10.948
Well...

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.623
I think he was gonna
ask me to marry him.

01:05:18.831 --> 01:05:20.750
What?

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:30.551
Several times before he left
he kept hinting... but I...

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:45.482
You're not mom. And whatever
happens you need to remember

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:47.068
that.

01:05:49.403 --> 01:05:50.613
You too.

01:05:58.537 --> 01:05:59.121
You need something?

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.665
No, that's alright.

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:13.886
Whatchu doin'?

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.097
Writin' to Reggie.

01:06:17.014 --> 01:06:18.766
But... how are...?

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:21.559
Why if he's, um...

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.187
Missing in action?

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.899
I may not know where he is, but God does.
He'll get the letter

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:29.485
to him, one way or another.

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:34.155
How do you do it?

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:35.448
Do what?

01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.118
Keep the faith.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:44.041
Faith... is the confidence
of things hoped for.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:47.670
And if Reggie dies?

01:06:50.715 --> 01:06:54.301
Then I have the assurance
of things not seen.

01:06:59.223 --> 01:07:01.809
Are you spending all your
time at that hospital?

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:06.104
Ran into Peter's grandma this morning.
They haven't heard

01:07:06.105 --> 01:07:07.648
anything either.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:12.319
Mother was so beautiful.

01:07:17.825 --> 01:07:21.078
I don't recall her ever crying.
Do you?

01:07:21.537 --> 01:07:24.790
No, but, I was little.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:31.046
I asked Daddy. He said she
yelled and screamed but he

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.257
doesn't remember her
ever crying either.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.511
What does that mean?

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:52.276
I think I'm beginning to
understand how she felt.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.738
You wouldn't...?

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:58.491
No.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.215
Mrs. Gerald Goodman?

01:08:15.216 --> 01:08:16.591
Yes?

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:21.763
I'm Mrs. Chapman, from the Red Cross.
Your husband has been

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:25.892
badly burned. He's been
transferred to the USS Repose

01:08:25.893 --> 01:08:28.479
with the other injured soldier

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.439
Is he going to be okay?

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.899
We have no way of
knowing, at this point.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:37.069
But he was well enough to jot
down a quick message, to let you

01:08:37.071 --> 01:08:40.823
know he's still alive. You
should receive word from him,

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.868
personally, in the
next week or so.

01:08:43.911 --> 01:08:46.747
He's alive.

01:08:56.715 --> 01:08:57.715
Mornin' Ma'am.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.136
Mornin' Mr. MacDougal.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.095
I hear about your young man.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:06.765
He's alive. He's
injured, but alive.

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:09.145
He's gonna be just fine.
I know it.

01:09:09.562 --> 01:09:12.438
Was there anything from
Ruby Mae's Reggie?

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:16.861
No, ma'am. Hopefully
he's alive too.

01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:36.587
Oh! Look at this one!
I hope it's a girl.

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:40.134
Me too! A boy's gonna look
awful silly in that thing.

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:47.975
Wonder why you haven't
heard anything yet?

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:52.229
I just... I have this...

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:55.732
But it's silly. The
lady said he'd be okay.

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.818
But I...

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.535
Guess I'll get it.

01:10:10.414 --> 01:10:12.041
Mrs. Goodman?

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:16.003
Milly? Milly!

01:10:19.131 --> 01:10:21.425
Mrs. Gerald Goodman?

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:25.970
It is with deepest regret that
I must inform you that your

01:10:25.971 --> 01:10:31.100
husband Gerald Francis Goodman
has died from injuries in the

01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:32.162
line of duty.

01:10:32.186 --> 01:10:36.482
But he was aline. The
lady said he was alive.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:41.779
His burn wounds were too severe.
They got an infection.

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.447
I'm sorry.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:47.201
Here's his personal effects.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:17.982
Can I get you something?

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.916
You gonna be okay?

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:42.881
You?

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:45.926
Helps to keep busy.

01:12:06.697 --> 01:12:09.574
When you've been beat
down so low that

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:12.679
there's nowhere else
to look but up.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:17.457
It's during those
times that God can

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:21.044
give you a strength that you
didn't know that you had.

01:12:21.045 --> 01:12:28.301
A strength that will not only see
you through the bitter times

01:12:28.302 --> 01:12:34.909
but it will make the future joys...
that much sweeter.

01:13:59.184 --> 01:14:02.353
We live in a fallen world.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.689
A world where young men who
should be at home with their

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:09.444
families are called a world away
to fight for the families of

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:13.591
foreigners. Gerald Francis
Goodman knew the risks.

01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:18.035
He accepted the danger in order
to serve his country in its

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:22.123
time of great need. He entered a
young man with his whole life.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:25.478
All his hopes and
dreams ahead of him.

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:29.464
And he leaves behind a wife, a
son and another little one on

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:33.426
the way. Forced to live the rest
of their lives without him.

01:14:33.427 --> 01:14:37.115
With only their faith
to help them through.

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.975
Faith is so easy, when
life is going great.

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:43.603
You know, those times where
it seems like every prayer is

01:14:43.604 --> 01:14:47.565
answered with a resounding "yes".
But faith is not so easy

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:54.489
when life takes cruel turns,
rips our lives apart, causes us

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:58.534
to live a life we never envisioned.
But it's in those

01:14:58.535 --> 01:15:03.789
times of struggle, when we have
nowhere else to turn, that we

01:15:03.790 --> 01:15:09.754
turn up, look up, and see the face of God.
Gerald didn't die

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:14.884
in vain. And he leaves behind a
legacy of love. For all who knew

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:22.885
him, and treasured him. And that love...
has changed all of

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:32.186
us forever. May that love comfort us...
in the days ahead.
