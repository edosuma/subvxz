WEBVTT

00:02.094 --> 00:03.311
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.312 --> 00:04.480
What the hell are you doing here?

00:04.481 --> 00:05.746
Came to pick up my big brother.

00:05.747 --> 00:07.183
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:07.184 --> 00:08.638
That's a violation of parole.

00:08.639 --> 00:10.344
Thank you for letting me stay here.

00:10.345 --> 00:12.194
It is not for you. It's for Gunnar.

00:12.248 --> 00:13.602
I want a divorce.

00:14.184 --> 00:16.898
He's still with that woman.
I heard them on the phone.

00:17.128 --> 00:20.570
You are my employees. You work for me,

00:20.571 --> 00:21.538
not this man!

00:21.539 --> 00:22.588
I quit.

00:23.379 --> 00:24.593
I don't think I can do this.

00:24.594 --> 00:25.872
You can. I know you can.

00:25.873 --> 00:27.762
I know that you're getting out of rehab.

00:27.763 --> 00:30.621
Wondered maybe if you wanted
to come live with me?

00:34.820 --> 00:37.485
Honey, do you think you should
be spendin' so much money?

00:38.451 --> 00:40.284
Maybe I should ask my manager.

00:41.182 --> 00:42.520
She says it's fine.

00:43.119 --> 00:44.888
Do we have anything else to do today?

00:44.889 --> 00:46.276
Uh, Deacon's birthday's on Monday

00:46.277 --> 00:47.667
if you wanna get him a present.

00:47.668 --> 00:49.107
Do you know which one it is?

00:49.108 --> 00:52.062
Uh, does it matter? They're
all supposed to be special.

00:52.325 --> 00:54.426
Well, maybe we could throw him
a party, and I could help.

00:54.427 --> 00:56.625
I'm pretty sure you're the
last person on the planet

00:56.626 --> 00:58.204
who should be planning a party.

00:59.108 --> 01:00.635
Although it's not a bad idea.

01:03.275 --> 01:05.394
Didn't expect a visit from
the first lady today.

01:05.394 --> 01:06.606
It's always a pleasure
to see you, Mrs. Conrad.

01:06.607 --> 01:07.848
You, too.

01:09.071 --> 01:11.092
Are you staying at Peggy Kenter's house

01:11.093 --> 01:13.391
since you moved out? Excuse me?

01:13.700 --> 01:15.517
Well, I know you're sleeping with her.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.730
I don't think my personal
life is your concern anymore.

01:19.731 --> 01:21.986
It... it is my concern, actually,

01:21.987 --> 01:24.621
when our 13-year-old daughter
overhears you on the phone

01:24.622 --> 01:28.695
saying something like, "it
feels right to be with you."

01:29.421 --> 01:31.582
I tried to explain it to
Maddie the best I could,

01:31.583 --> 01:33.550
but let me be clear with
you about something...

01:33.551 --> 01:35.929
I'm not covering for you with our girls

01:35.930 --> 01:37.674
the way I did with the press.

01:37.675 --> 01:40.178
Okay, fine. I'll talk to Maddie, all right?

01:40.179 --> 01:41.338
Yeah, you're damn right you will.

01:41.339 --> 01:43.446
Look. They're my daughters, too, Rayna.

01:45.051 --> 01:47.014
Well, keep your girlfriend away from 'em.

01:47.916 --> 01:48.949
Fine.

01:54.797 --> 01:55.980
Do you want a hand with that?

01:55.981 --> 01:57.208
No, I'm fine.

01:57.292 --> 01:58.791
Here, give me one of those.

01:59.430 --> 02:00.513
Thanks.

02:01.382 --> 02:02.369
You doing the crossword?

02:02.370 --> 02:03.734
Nah, I'm no good at those.

02:03.735 --> 02:05.985
I'm trying to find a job
for a dude with no I.D.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.455
I can't help thinking
it'd be easier for you

02:09.457 --> 02:12.105
if you went back an fixed
things in Texas first.

02:12.106 --> 02:14.206
Law ain't the only folks
lookin' for me back there.

02:14.207 --> 02:16.970
I might have made some
enemies during my time.

02:17.392 --> 02:19.582
Milk and cleaning supplies in the same bag?

02:19.583 --> 02:21.546
It's ridiculous. Hey, check this out.

02:22.592 --> 02:23.524
That's just wrong.

02:23.525 --> 02:24.799
What are you, the grocery bag police?

02:24.800 --> 02:27.317
We, uh, spent some summers
baggin' groceries

02:27.318 --> 02:28.651
at Mr. brown's corner store.

02:28.652 --> 02:30.350
We'd have been fired if
we put refrigerated goods

02:30.351 --> 02:32.330
and scouring powder in the same bag.

02:33.839 --> 02:35.649
At Mr. brown's, we pack your sack.

02:35.650 --> 02:37.380
We pack your sack to save your back.

02:37.381 --> 02:39.878
At Mr. brown's, we have a knack. We know...

02:39.879 --> 02:42.849
Just how to pack your snacks.

02:43.031 --> 02:44.002
Hit me.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.905
Hey.

02:48.535 --> 02:49.473
Hey.

02:50.694 --> 02:51.701
What's wrong?

02:51.702 --> 02:52.605
I just wanted to let you know

02:52.606 --> 02:54.840
that Teddy and I are getting a divorce.

02:55.598 --> 02:56.195
What?

02:56.196 --> 02:57.934
He filed three days ago...

02:58.885 --> 02:59.810
In Sumner county,

02:59.811 --> 03:02.141
you know, so that we'd
have a little more time

03:02.142 --> 03:05.192
before people figure it out,
get our ducks in a row.

03:05.918 --> 03:08.664
He's been sleeping with
Peggy Kenter, too, so...

03:09.726 --> 03:11.065
Do you wanna come in? No, I don't.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.774
I really wish I did, but I don't.

03:13.324 --> 03:15.004
I gotta go pick up the girls anyway,

03:15.005 --> 03:16.237
and got a lot to do, so...

03:16.238 --> 03:18.573
I'm coming with you. Just give me a second.

03:18.574 --> 03:21.536
So far, over two dozen R.S.V.Ps.

03:21.537 --> 03:22.760
Not bad for a few hours.

03:22.761 --> 03:25.779
Wow. Well, the man's got fans.

03:25.780 --> 03:27.271
Did Watty White R.S.V.P.?

03:27.272 --> 03:29.298
Because if he comes, everyone's gonna come.

03:29.366 --> 03:31.162
A definite yes. He said he'd pay good money

03:31.163 --> 03:33.979
to see Deacon's reaction to a
party thrown in his honor.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.535
He hates them. But I'm telling you,

03:35.536 --> 03:37.737
it's all because nobody's
ever thrown him a good one.

03:37.999 --> 03:39.610
Have we figured out how to get him there?

03:39.611 --> 03:41.071
Uh, I thought you'd handle that.

03:41.072 --> 03:44.010
Doesn't he have a niece that lives here?

03:44.112 --> 03:46.504
Maybe we can track her down
and see if she can help.

03:50.656 --> 03:54.744
Hey. How are you? I am so glad to see you.

03:54.745 --> 03:56.530
How are you, jolene? I'm good.

03:56.779 --> 03:59.624
Baby, this is Dante, my
addiction counselor.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.397
Hey. Hey.

04:00.398 --> 04:02.489
So you two ready to get started? Yeah.

04:02.942 --> 04:03.836
Us two?

04:03.837 --> 04:06.502
We talked about this.
It's a family session.

04:06.719 --> 04:08.251
Uh, I can't.

04:08.252 --> 04:09.915
I can't do it today. I'm sorry.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.230
I'm in the middle of...
of planning this party.

04:12.765 --> 04:13.911
Next time, okay?

04:13.912 --> 04:16.050
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

04:16.051 --> 04:17.505
Next time then. That's good.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.291
No problem. Well, let's... let's go.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.796
I feel like I wouldn't be
doing my sisterly duty

04:25.797 --> 04:29.936
if I didn't ask about the Deacon of it all.

04:32.501 --> 04:36.570
Um, oh, boy, things with us
are so strange right now,

04:36.571 --> 04:40.882
and I have not talked to him,
and I need to. I really do.

04:40.883 --> 04:41.913
But you know...

04:43.367 --> 04:45.855
Priority is the girls, you know?

04:45.856 --> 04:48.026
This is so hard on them.

04:48.428 --> 04:51.766
And so I just... I just need
to focus on them right now.

04:52.011 --> 04:53.535
Hey, mom, you've got to see this.

04:53.536 --> 04:55.402
They wrote about your divorce.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.242
Thought you were workin' on lyrics.

05:03.264 --> 05:04.282
I am.

05:04.960 --> 05:07.450
Kind of just looks like
you're just mad at the floor.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.986
I get writer's block, and I clean.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.018
It's a thing. Well, I won't help,

05:13.019 --> 05:14.801
'cause I don't want to get in
the way of your process, so...

05:14.802 --> 05:18.509
Nice try. Would you mind seeing
if Jason has any laundry to do?

05:19.251 --> 05:20.654
All right, that I can do.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:33.587 --> 05:34.627
Did you know he had a gun?

05:34.628 --> 05:36.584
No. What are you doing?

05:36.585 --> 05:37.887
I'm gonna take... unload that.

05:37.888 --> 05:39.186
Scarlett, he is my brother,
and I will deal with it.

05:39.187 --> 05:41.505
And you are not leaving this
house with a loaded weapon!

05:41.506 --> 05:44.489
Fine. But nobody's getting
hurt with this gun.

05:46.160 --> 05:47.433
You promise me that.

05:47.535 --> 05:48.746
I promise.

05:52.928 --> 05:55.593
Xxx

05:53.072 --> 05:54.087
they know about the divorce?

05:54.088 --> 05:56.992
Is any of this true about Deacon and Liam?

05:59.342 --> 06:01.645
Not a word. No, this isn't...

06:01.646 --> 06:03.993
uh, too...

06:05.230 --> 06:06.970
You know what, girls? Let's
go on out to the car.

06:06.971 --> 06:09.208
Aunt Tandy's gonna take
care of all this. I got it.

06:09.209 --> 06:10.763
I got it, just go. Just
buy all those magazines.

06:10.764 --> 06:12.118
Throw them in the garbage.
Here, take your purse.

06:12.548 --> 06:13.567

06:31.770 --> 06:34.373
So you're saying all those
pictures were just photoshopped?

06:35.212 --> 06:36.714
No, honey, I'm not saying that.

06:36.715 --> 06:39.738
Honey, it's all about making
money for those people.

06:39.739 --> 06:41.514
The people who take the pictures,

06:41.515 --> 06:44.693
the people who publish them with
all kinds of misinformation...

06:45.019 --> 06:47.045
they prey on celebrities.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.639
But they were right about the divorce,

06:48.640 --> 06:50.282
and they were right about dad.

06:51.889 --> 06:53.450
They're not right about this.

07:03.024 --> 07:04.409
Oh, my gosh.

07:04.414 --> 07:05.353
What?

07:07.807 --> 07:10.169
Wow. Deacon texts now.

07:13.151 --> 07:14.358
I gotta talk to him.

07:14.359 --> 07:17.488
Well, you could use that thing
in your hand to call him.

07:17.886 --> 07:20.481
I don't think this is a phone
call kind of a conversation.

07:20.952 --> 07:22.482
You need to be careful.

07:22.999 --> 07:24.209
Yeah, I know.

07:25.415 --> 07:26.503
You wanting to meet all the way out here...

07:26.504 --> 07:28.708
am I just supposed to act
like this is normal?

07:30.120 --> 07:31.203
I don't know.

07:34.313 --> 07:36.173
I'm supposed to act like this is normal?

07:37.108 --> 07:38.685
You going through my stuff now?

07:39.091 --> 07:40.618
You said you got rid of it.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.692
You said you wanted to start over clean.

07:43.307 --> 07:44.330
You lied.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.095
I'd love to forget about my past,

07:46.096 --> 07:48.008
but it ain't gonna forget about me.

07:51.167 --> 07:53.481
Stop being a jackass and give me the gun.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.058
Come on, man. I need that.

08:01.471 --> 08:02.442
No!

08:06.767 --> 08:08.346
Why the hell did you do that?

08:08.416 --> 08:09.405
I did it for your own good.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.776
You got no idea.

08:11.917 --> 08:12.802
You and I are done.

08:12.803 --> 08:15.353
No, we are not done.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.141
You owe me eight years
for the time I served.

08:17.142 --> 08:18.737
You owe me a life.

08:20.152 --> 08:22.737
You owe me a life supposed to be mine.

08:24.263 --> 08:26.542
Don't you come callin' for
me to bail you out again,

08:26.543 --> 08:28.345
'cause I am not gonna be there.

08:28.558 --> 08:29.545
Gunnar.

08:30.608 --> 08:31.624
Gunnar!

08:33.503 --> 08:34.583
Gunnar!

08:42.735 --> 08:44.511
Hey there. Hi.

08:44.512 --> 08:47.459
Hi. Are you Scarlett O'Connor,
Deacon Claybourne's niece?

08:47.460 --> 08:49.645
Yes. Is everything all right?

08:53.523 --> 08:55.420
Oh, don't be afraid.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.085
Hey. I'm Juliette.

08:58.219 --> 08:59.258
Scarlett O'Connor.

08:59.259 --> 09:01.119
Nice to meet you. Look,
I'm kind of in a rush,

09:01.120 --> 09:03.551
but I was hoping you could help
get Deacon to the bluebird

09:03.552 --> 09:05.386
Monday night for a surprise party.

09:06.081 --> 09:07.244
Deacon's a little funny about parties.

09:07.245 --> 09:08.406
He doesn't like them.

09:08.407 --> 09:10.333
He sits at home and watches
"old yeller" every year.

09:10.334 --> 09:11.616
Well, I don't care what he's done before.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.466
He's gonna celebrate his damn birthday.
He hates them.

09:14.467 --> 09:16.845
He's not gonna hate this one. Trust me.

09:17.396 --> 09:19.323
He's gotta be there at 8:00 P.M.

09:19.324 --> 09:21.829
Okay. Can you do that or not?

09:23.147 --> 09:25.010
If I tell him that my friend
Gunnar and I are singing,

09:25.011 --> 09:26.209
he might turn up.

09:26.210 --> 09:27.832
Okay. Well pick your favorite song,

09:27.833 --> 09:29.170
and we'll see you there.

09:29.993 --> 09:30.700
You want us to sing?

09:30.701 --> 09:32.888
Sure, you can say you opened
up for Juliette Barnes.

09:32.889 --> 09:34.530
Just get him there on time.

09:35.721 --> 09:36.786
Okay.

09:42.391 --> 09:43.794
So what's next for you?

09:44.117 --> 09:46.303
I'm contemplating some things.

09:47.172 --> 09:50.446
Yeah, well, you should be mayor right now.

09:50.804 --> 09:52.366
We're not here to talk about me.

09:52.756 --> 09:54.351
What are you doing for your birthday?

09:55.333 --> 09:57.343
I'm contemplating a few things.

09:58.676 --> 10:00.135
No, you're gonna sit at home,

10:00.136 --> 10:01.280
you're gonna watch "rin tin tin" again.

10:01.281 --> 10:03.031
It's "old yeller," man. Come on, now.

10:03.032 --> 10:05.313
It's a great damn movie. It's a classic.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.661
Xx

10:06.731 --> 10:08.450
so... am I gonna be the one

10:08.451 --> 10:10.573
that brings up the elephant in the room?

10:10.675 --> 10:12.205
Probably, yeah.

10:14.163 --> 10:16.989
You didn't know about Rayna
and Teddy splitting up?

10:17.267 --> 10:19.389
I found out the same way
the whole world did.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.212
Rayna, we're going to manage this,

10:21.213 --> 10:22.336
but in order to do that,

10:22.337 --> 10:24.910
I need absolute honesty from you.

10:24.911 --> 10:26.394
So did you sleep with Liam McGuinnis

10:26.395 --> 10:28.202
or Deacon Claybourne
while you were married?

10:28.203 --> 10:30.385
And please tell me there's no sex tape.

10:30.386 --> 10:32.094
Oh, excuse me.

10:32.115 --> 10:32.997
Do I need to leave?

10:32.998 --> 10:34.295
No, I might, actually.

10:34.296 --> 10:36.146
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:38.056 --> 10:41.242
You know, I'm not gonna...
answer questions.

10:41.243 --> 10:43.333
Okay, but at the very least...

10:44.353 --> 10:45.675
Just be sure not to be photographed

10:45.676 --> 10:47.765
with any men who aren't your father.

10:47.851 --> 10:49.090
I can call Juliette's people

10:49.091 --> 10:50.063
and tell them Rayna won't be coming

10:50.064 --> 10:51.463
to Deacon's birthday party.

10:51.464 --> 10:53.104
Deacon's having a birthday party?

10:53.799 --> 10:55.829
Are they doing a public
screening of "old yeller"?

10:55.830 --> 10:58.257
Whatever it is, madam, you aren't going.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.697
Did she just call me "madam"?

11:03.671 --> 11:07.601
♪My friend, my friend, you are traveling♪

11:08.936 --> 11:13.014
♪Some of your secrets are unraveling♪

11:13.015 --> 11:16.548
?Ooh, some other pictures

11:16.549 --> 11:18.327

11:18.328 --> 11:23.762
♪I see the water washing over you♪

11:33.908 --> 11:37.390

11:42.759 --> 11:47.472
?We flow and flow

11:53.510 --> 11:54.641
nice song.

11:56.071 --> 11:58.097
You plannin' on being here every day?

11:58.694 --> 12:00.502
On an as-needed basis.

12:00.503 --> 12:02.053
Okay, well, if my mama still needs you,

12:02.054 --> 12:04.321
you should probably check in
another part of the house.

12:05.222 --> 12:06.992
Here's what I don't understand.

12:08.597 --> 12:10.397
Why ask your mom to stay with you

12:10.398 --> 12:12.840
if you don't want to be part
of the recovery process?

12:13.134 --> 12:15.616
I am a part of the recovery... a big part.

12:15.617 --> 12:17.323
I'm the check-writing part.

12:17.615 --> 12:19.242
That's not what I'm talking about.

12:20.159 --> 12:21.633
I can tell you from personal experience

12:21.634 --> 12:23.007
the time when I finally got clean

12:23.008 --> 12:25.113
was when my family got involved.

12:26.016 --> 12:28.441
Frankly, you're more interested
in this party you're throwing.

12:29.732 --> 12:31.917
Get a load of this.

12:32.342 --> 12:33.642
Xxx

12:33.643 --> 12:35.061
no way.

12:35.866 --> 12:37.688
Well, looks like the queen of country music

12:37.689 --> 12:39.300
won't be coming to my party.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.749
Oh, you mean Deacon's?

12:41.012 --> 12:42.349
You know what I mean.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.677
Hey, this is Peggy. Please
leave me a message.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.053
Hey, it's me.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.030
So my people are telling me

12:52.031 --> 12:55.354
I need to distance myself
from you, which I don't want,

12:55.999 --> 12:57.897
and I hope you don't either.

12:58.783 --> 13:02.186
But, uh... I'm gonna think of something.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.480
I promise.

13:03.816 --> 13:07.362
And one, two, three, four, and five...

13:07.363 --> 13:09.340
I feel like everybody's looking at me.

13:09.650 --> 13:12.366
That's because everybody is looking at you.

13:12.898 --> 13:14.693
Rayna. Hey.

13:14.694 --> 13:16.240
Hey, Jane, how are you?

13:16.241 --> 13:17.867
I'm just fine. Good.

13:18.113 --> 13:19.979
Tandy. Hey.

13:22.015 --> 13:24.382
I saw that you and Teddy were on the outs

13:24.383 --> 13:26.363
in that terrible magazine.

13:26.364 --> 13:28.805
I just wanna say I am so sorry.

13:29.371 --> 13:30.438
Thank you.

13:31.451 --> 13:32.270
And don't let all that stuff

13:32.271 --> 13:34.902
about you and your guitar
player get to you.

13:34.903 --> 13:38.520
There was always talk, so what's
just a little bit more, right?

13:40.921 --> 13:42.691
Okay.

13:43.084 --> 13:45.267
She has not changed one
bit since high school.

13:45.272 --> 13:46.505
She has so much nerve.

13:46.506 --> 13:49.510
Everybody knows that she's
cattin' around with her Manny.

13:49.564 --> 13:51.842
I thought it was that tennis...
the tennis instructor?

13:51.843 --> 13:55.546
Hey. Y'all looked... mmm... incredible.

13:55.547 --> 13:57.265
Incredible. Let's get your coats.
Let's get out of here.

13:57.687 --> 13:59.249
No sugar for mama?

13:59.944 --> 14:01.282
Teenagers.

14:02.654 --> 14:05.010
Hey, Rayna! Rayna Jaymes! Over here!

14:05.011 --> 14:06.843
Car

14:06.844 --> 14:09.510
how are you and Deacon? Huh?

14:09.577 --> 14:10.626
What's going on?

14:10.651 --> 14:11.619
Been trying to get some on the side?

14:11.620 --> 14:12.625
Excuse me.

14:12.626 --> 14:13.993
How's it going with you and Liam?

14:13.994 --> 14:15.750
Are you guys still seeing each other?

14:16.007 --> 14:17.122
Who's better?

14:17.137 --> 14:18.794
Talk to us, Rayna!

14:19.043 --> 14:20.851
Hey, guys, beautiful family!

14:20.852 --> 14:22.443
Mom, I'm scared.

14:22.444 --> 14:23.895
Girls, don't look.

14:35.046 --> 14:36.993
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go ahead and get this.

14:37.063 --> 14:39.224
Man, I used to dig your
shows over at the 5 spot.

14:39.225 --> 14:41.507
Yeah, me, too. New stuff's
pretty different.

14:41.512 --> 14:43.165
Now, anyway. Like, uh, hip-hop/indie/punk.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.237
What do you call it?

14:44.238 --> 14:46.327
Ah, I don't really know anymore.

14:46.366 --> 14:47.541
Well, whatever it is, man,

14:47.542 --> 14:49.731
it seems like it's making
you some cash, man.

14:49.732 --> 14:51.742
Let me go grab that case for you.
All right.

14:56.243 --> 14:57.821
Well, that's a thing of beauty.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.756
She goes 25k, I bet?

15:02.995 --> 15:04.157
Thereabouts.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.722
Uh, Mr. white, you probably
don't remember me,

15:07.723 --> 15:09.202
but we've actually met before.

15:09.203 --> 15:12.123
I'm Avery Barkley. I used to date Scarlett.

15:12.124 --> 15:13.926
Oh, right, sure. Right.

15:14.779 --> 15:17.254
Is it all right if I get
your advice on something?

15:18.315 --> 15:20.411
See, I'm working with this
producer out of Atlanta.

15:20.412 --> 15:23.541
And, um, what he's done with my sound,

15:23.820 --> 15:26.147
I'm just... I'm not sure it's
what I should be doing.

15:26.148 --> 15:28.382
Well, "should's" not the right word

15:28.383 --> 15:31.689
when it comes to music, son.
Just my advice.

15:33.135 --> 15:34.217
Thanks.

15:47.518 --> 15:49.961
That sounds pretty. Is that new?

15:50.703 --> 15:52.265
Uh-huh. How you feeling?

15:53.184 --> 15:55.945
How 'bout we get out of here?
I don't think we can.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.441
Everywhere we go, they're
just gonna hound us.

15:58.511 --> 15:59.151
I'm gonna stay here.

15:59.152 --> 16:00.515
I'm holing up, and I'm gonna write

16:00.516 --> 16:02.305
until this whole thing passes over.

16:02.307 --> 16:03.581
That's a good plan.

16:03.669 --> 16:05.599
How 'bout I go pick up the girls for you?

16:07.621 --> 16:09.662
Bye. Thank you.

16:10.821 --> 16:13.089
We're gonna get you a new phone number.

16:20.612 --> 16:22.430
Looks like we've got us a dog.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.228
Mama, you don't mean we're gonna keep

16:24.229 --> 16:27.473
that old, ugly yeller
dog, after what he done?

16:27.478 --> 16:28.751
He isn't an ugly yeller dog.

16:28.752 --> 16:31.882
Comin'. He's a purdy yeller dog.

16:33.985 --> 16:35.018
Comin'.

16:38.034 --> 16:39.227
Happy Birthday.

16:40.257 --> 16:42.498
Thank you. Mama called.
Told me to give you this.

16:42.499 --> 16:44.349
You have to do this. Wait. Wait. Look.

16:44.834 --> 16:47.069
Eh... what are you doing to my cupcake?

16:47.074 --> 16:48.221
I'm fixin' it.

16:48.595 --> 16:50.524
Now you get frosting in every bite.

16:51.538 --> 16:52.246
That's pretty smart.

16:52.247 --> 16:53.537
I thought of that.

16:54.743 --> 16:55.911
You doing the usual?

16:55.912 --> 16:57.534
Oh, yeah. Come on in. Watch with me.

16:57.535 --> 16:59.129
No, that movie makes me cry.

16:59.391 --> 17:01.152
And I gotta go get ready
for the bluebird tonight.

17:01.153 --> 17:02.971
I'm playing with Gunnar. Oh, cool.

17:03.312 --> 17:05.056
You ain't seen us play yet, have you?

17:05.057 --> 17:06.426
No, I haven't.

17:08.739 --> 17:10.719
Hey, why don't I come
watch y'all play tonight?

17:10.835 --> 17:12.396
That's such a good idea.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.012
I'll see you at 8:00.

17:14.013 --> 17:14.821
All right. See ya then.

17:14.823 --> 17:16.880
Happy Birthday. Thank you, cupcake.

17:19.015 --> 17:20.193
Here we are again.

17:20.808 --> 17:23.633
And people wonder why you can't
get anything done in government.

17:24.919 --> 17:28.607
First of all, the photographs of my wife

17:28.608 --> 17:30.777
were taken completely out of context

17:31.102 --> 17:33.545
and used unfairly to attack her character.

17:33.706 --> 17:37.017
Xxx

17:34.142 --> 17:35.874
she has certainly never been unfaithful,

17:35.875 --> 17:37.150
and neither have I.

17:37.151 --> 17:39.944
And my wife and I are going
through a very civil divorce,

17:39.945 --> 17:42.786
and I ask that you respect
our privacy at this time.

17:40.314 --> 17:42.665
Xxx

17:42.808 --> 17:45.159
to the real business of the city,

17:45.160 --> 17:47.218
I have two new appointments to announce...

17:47.271 --> 17:50.402
Cayden Maxwell, as head of my
business advisory council,

17:48.566 --> 17:50.519
xxx

17:51.055 --> 17:53.196
and Peggy Kenter will be
joining my administration

17:53.197 --> 17:55.991
as a financial consultant
for special projects.

17:56.702 --> 18:00.871
Now I hope that this puts
an end to any specu...

18:01.408 --> 18:02.906
unbelievable.

18:03.681 --> 18:04.956
Paw-paw!

18:12.483 --> 18:14.556
Daphne, I need to talk
to your mama, all right?

18:14.624 --> 18:15.675
Okay.

18:19.353 --> 18:20.809
You come to tell me that
this reflects poorly

18:20.810 --> 18:22.277
on the mayor's office?

18:22.388 --> 18:24.110
I came to tell you that I'm sorry.

18:24.371 --> 18:27.181
See, when I put Teddy up for mayor,

18:28.051 --> 18:30.766
I thought it might help
him to right his ship,

18:31.156 --> 18:32.494
keep the family strong.

18:33.860 --> 18:35.868
After everything that happened
with that cumberland deal,

18:35.869 --> 18:37.847
he needed a win. You did, too.

18:38.812 --> 18:41.639
So you gonna... you gonna fight back?

18:42.508 --> 18:44.486
Have your attorney threaten a lawsuit.

18:45.230 --> 18:48.486
No, daddy. I'm gonna... keep my head low

18:50.174 --> 18:51.767
and wait for these damn reporters

18:52.062 --> 18:54.391
to come up with something
else they wanna talk about

18:55.870 --> 18:57.767
so I can walk out my front door again

18:58.270 --> 19:01.015
without publically embarrassing
my children every day.

19:02.221 --> 19:03.288
Rayna...

19:04.445 --> 19:06.698
You didn't do anything wrong.

19:07.566 --> 19:09.686
Don't you dare walk down
the street anything less

19:09.687 --> 19:11.889
than proud to be who you are.

19:12.439 --> 19:13.882
You may use your mother's maiden name,

19:13.883 --> 19:15.559
but you're still a Wyatt.

19:16.797 --> 19:18.791
You only have to explain yourself

19:19.181 --> 19:20.104
to people you care about.

19:20.105 --> 19:21.587
All the rest of 'em...

19:23.578 --> 19:25.123
Well, they can go to hell.

19:41.903 --> 19:44.584
We're about to sing in front of
so many big country music stars.

19:45.695 --> 19:46.697
You nervous?

19:47.151 --> 19:48.137
Nah.

19:48.591 --> 19:49.673
What is it, then?

19:51.192 --> 19:52.465
Jason called.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.952
After two days?

19:54.871 --> 19:55.921
What'd he say?

19:56.758 --> 19:58.145
Don't know. I didn't pick up.

20:00.039 --> 20:01.521
Hard to find parkin'.

20:02.561 --> 20:03.281
What are y'all doin' out here?

20:03.282 --> 20:04.478
Makin' sure you turn up.

20:04.849 --> 20:05.663
Ha.

20:06.129 --> 20:06.937
Lookin' forward to it.

20:06.938 --> 20:08.596
I keep hearin' about this hot new duo.

20:09.527 --> 20:11.550
You know, first time I ever even
did an open mic, it was here.

20:11.551 --> 20:12.506
Oh, is that right?

20:13.264 --> 20:14.266
After you, old-timer.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.818
Age before beauty?

20:17.428 --> 20:18.320
Thank you.

20:18.597 --> 20:20.864
Surprise!

20:22.333 --> 20:23.807
Oh, no. No, no, no, man. Hey, come on.

20:23.826 --> 20:26.657
Give it a minute. Give it a minute.
I can't believe you did this!

20:26.658 --> 20:28.096
Your pretty little friend
over there did it.

20:28.097 --> 20:30.285
Oh, that I believe. Happy Birthday!

20:30.385 --> 20:31.423
You shouldn't have.

20:31.424 --> 20:32.497
I know, I know,

20:32.498 --> 20:34.019
but I'm taking your advice
and treatin' people better.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.130
And look at everybody who wanted
to say Happy Birthday to you!

20:36.131 --> 20:37.583
Aw. There you are. What's up, man?

20:37.732 --> 20:39.379
How you doing, bro? Hey, thank you, man.

20:39.380 --> 20:40.663
Hey, kip, thanks for coming.

20:40.987 --> 20:42.210
I wasn't gonna miss this thing.

20:42.211 --> 20:43.963
This guy's been inspiring
me for a long time.

20:43.964 --> 20:45.147
I find that hard to believe.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.055
Your songs are much happier than mine are.

20:47.253 --> 20:49.762
I don't know, bud. You look
pretty happy right there, bud.

20:50.524 --> 20:52.504
Jolene, how you doing? Good to see you.

20:52.505 --> 20:53.577
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

20:53.578 --> 20:54.886
Baby, you saved my life.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.407
I'm glad you're looking so good.

20:56.408 --> 20:57.780
Hey, Pam. Happy Birthday.

20:58.349 --> 21:00.190
Thank you, sweetheart. You
know Juliette Barnes?

21:00.191 --> 21:01.798
Miss Tillis, it is such
an honor to meet you.

21:01.799 --> 21:04.105
I'm a huge fan. Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

21:05.035 --> 21:06.608
She's nicer than I heard she was.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.747
Thank you guys so much for coming.

21:13.748 --> 21:15.571
It's so great to see how
many people love Deacon

21:15.572 --> 21:16.784
as much as I do.

21:20.788 --> 21:24.419
And a little fun fact is
Deacon's got so much talent,

21:24.420 --> 21:26.387
it couldn't all be contained
in one generation.

21:26.388 --> 21:28.052
So, ladies and gentlemen, give it up

21:28.053 --> 21:30.708
for Deacon's niece Scarlett O'Connor

21:30.709 --> 21:32.049
and Gunnar Scott.

21:37.683 --> 21:38.815
Oh, thank you.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.113
Deacon, I'm sorry for tricking
you into coming out here,

21:42.114 --> 21:43.439
and for the photographs.

21:44.296 --> 21:45.502
But Happy Birthday.

Hey, did you leave already
for Deacon's party?

23:30.395 --> 23:31.274
Not yet.

23:31.758 --> 23:32.709
Could you do me a huge favor?

23:32.710 --> 23:34.146
Would you be willing to come by and...

23:34.948 --> 23:36.040
I just wanna play you something.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.316
Sure. See you in a bit.

23:38.074 --> 23:39.690
You're a sweetheart. All
right, I'll see you.

23:43.581 --> 23:45.669
So many fine men.

23:46.856 --> 23:48.182
Have served the city of Nashville

23:48.183 --> 23:50.388
from where you now sit.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.728
I'm well aware that several did

23:52.729 --> 23:54.439
in large part due to your efforts,

23:54.440 --> 23:55.653
myself included.

23:56.313 --> 23:58.517
Well, it's always nice to be appreciated.

23:58.523 --> 24:00.950
Hmm. So how can I help you?

24:02.219 --> 24:03.945
Could have treated my daughter better.

24:04.705 --> 24:05.598
Huh.

24:06.849 --> 24:10.302
With all due respect, I did that...
for 13 years.

24:10.929 --> 24:12.319
Apparently, it wasn't good enough.

24:12.842 --> 24:16.257
Now... if you have Metro
business to discuss with me,

24:16.258 --> 24:17.298
I'd be open to hearing it,

24:17.299 --> 24:19.474
but if you came down here
to dig into my marriage,

24:19.475 --> 24:21.424
my divorce, or my personal life,

24:21.560 --> 24:23.839
that is not gonna happen. Hmm.

24:24.204 --> 24:26.233
Oh, Teddy. You're right, you're right.

24:26.330 --> 24:30.106
After all... you're not
my son-in-law anymore,

24:30.107 --> 24:31.208
you are the mayor.

24:31.549 --> 24:32.489
And to that end,

24:33.257 --> 24:37.128
I have some... appointment suggestions.

24:37.707 --> 24:41.160
Hank Tully as the deputy
mayor is the most pressing.

24:43.708 --> 24:45.751
Okay. I'll definitely consider him.

24:46.508 --> 24:48.342
You make sure you do more than that.

24:53.252 --> 24:55.698
I took an oath to serve the best interests

24:55.699 --> 24:56.943
of the people of this city.

24:57.940 --> 24:59.774
Hopefully, they align with yours.

25:00.419 --> 25:01.919
Took an oath, did ya?

25:03.299 --> 25:04.944
Isn't that kind of like a vow?

25:13.559 --> 25:15.313
Hey, Rayna! Rayna Jaymes! Rayna Jaymes!
Over here!

25:15.314 --> 25:16.318
Oh, my God.

25:19.649 --> 25:20.274
Wanna leave?

25:21.426 --> 25:23.774
Hey there, Rayna, here
to see your boyfriend?

25:25.283 --> 25:26.350
Hell, no.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.476
Good girl. Give me a
minute to get around here.

25:30.064 --> 25:31.723
Rayna! Hey, Rayna!

25:31.724 --> 25:33.159
Hey there, Rayna, here
to see your boyfriend?

25:33.548 --> 25:35.112
Hey, Rayna, how long you
been seeing Liam, huh?

25:35.113 --> 25:36.101
Lucas, what happened?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.207
"The tennessean" stop paying you?

25:37.208 --> 25:38.915
I thought you were a real photojournalist.

25:40.226 --> 25:42.442
If y'all excuse me, I'm gonna
get on with my life. Thank you.

25:44.175 --> 25:44.956
Oh, yeah.

25:45.261 --> 25:46.348
Still out there.

25:49.024 --> 25:49.851
Well...

25:50.751 --> 25:52.314
Now this is a surprise party.

25:53.118 --> 25:54.138
Happy Birthday.

25:54.276 --> 25:55.154
Thank you.

26:00.172 --> 26:03.190
Deacon. Hey, what's the
name of that crazy song...

26:03.191 --> 26:04.683
I'm sure you don't wanna talk about it,

26:04.684 --> 26:07.518
but can I say at least you
look great in the photo?

26:07.519 --> 26:08.637
Cheers. Cheers.

26:08.638 --> 26:09.834
It's good to see you. You, too.

26:16.273 --> 26:17.403
Gunnar Scott?

26:18.480 --> 26:19.261
Yeah?

26:21.304 --> 26:22.444
We're gonna need you to come with us.

26:24.432 --> 26:26.795
Man, I gotta say, I never
thought I'd see the day

26:27.055 --> 26:29.228
that Deacon would actually
celebrate his birthday.

26:29.695 --> 26:30.846
You and he both.

26:30.847 --> 26:33.244
You know, he still watches
that movie on vhs.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.575
Mr. gill, Mr. white, it's such
an honor for y'all to be here.

26:36.576 --> 26:37.603
I hope you're having fun.

26:37.604 --> 26:39.376
Well, more fun than he is, probably.

26:40.403 --> 26:42.308
And you came. I did.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.669
Even with the article about you and Deacon.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.761
Girl, you have got to get a new publicist.

26:48.324 --> 26:49.539
Well, it's a beautiful party.

26:49.540 --> 26:50.725
Thank you for having me,

26:50.726 --> 26:53.150
and I've got a song that I
would actually love to play.

26:53.733 --> 26:55.249
You know, I didn't know you were comin'.

26:55.445 --> 26:57.237
Got a little something I wanna sing myself.

26:57.238 --> 26:59.618
We'll see. I'll let you know.

27:00.917 --> 27:01.696
Charming.

27:02.106 --> 27:02.905
Charming, yes.

27:04.696 --> 27:07.256
All right. How 'bout a few
words from the birthday boy?

27:07.257 --> 27:08.997
Deacon, get your butt up here.

27:09.068 --> 27:10.069
Aw, man.

27:10.070 --> 27:11.347
All right. Okay. Um...

27:14.878 --> 27:15.784
Do I have to?

27:16.237 --> 27:17.451
Come on. You have to admit,

27:17.452 --> 27:18.636
this is more fun than sittin' at home

27:18.637 --> 27:20.233
watchin' a sad movie by yourself.

27:22.589 --> 27:25.467
For the record, "old yeller"
is not a sad movie.

27:25.468 --> 27:28.404
It is the uplifting tale
of the unconditional love

27:28.405 --> 27:29.903
between a boy and his dog.

27:32.388 --> 27:34.050
It's easy to forget how
many friends you have,

27:34.051 --> 27:37.615
and you guys sure do know how
to make a man feel, uh...

27:37.731 --> 27:38.720
Appreciated.

27:38.828 --> 27:40.207
And let's not do this again next year.

27:42.579 --> 27:43.487
To Deacon.

27:43.529 --> 27:44.819
To Deacon!

27:44.951 --> 27:45.715
To Deacon!

27:45.716 --> 27:47.023
To Deacon!

27:47.024 --> 27:47.995
Whoo!

28:06.731 --> 28:08.502
What? Somebody drop the cake?

28:08.906 --> 28:10.072
Not exactly.

28:11.598 --> 28:13.034
What the hell happened?

28:14.140 --> 28:16.783
She was fine. You saw her.
She was all right.

28:16.784 --> 28:18.492
I'm fine. That's how it
is with this, you know?

28:18.493 --> 28:19.628
Just when you think you got it licked,

28:19.629 --> 28:20.826
that's when you're most vulnerable.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.653
Will you call her addiction counselor,

28:22.654 --> 28:23.612
see if he can come get her?

28:23.613 --> 28:24.914
Let's just get her home, Juliette.

28:25.021 --> 28:27.257
No. No, you stay. I got this.

28:28.109 --> 28:30.058
Come on. I really wanted to sing for you.

28:30.624 --> 28:32.907
Yeah, well, I hear you sing all the time.

28:33.646 --> 28:34.858
I wanted to sing here.

28:40.721 --> 28:43.017
"Financial consultant" was perfect.

28:44.955 --> 28:46.136
We'll meet once a week

28:46.137 --> 28:49.033
and, uh, go over the budget
with my whole staff.

28:49.034 --> 28:50.006
It's smart.

28:50.170 --> 28:52.069
It's all business. Nothing to hide.

28:53.257 --> 28:55.543
Are you saying that we
have something to hide?

29:01.610 --> 29:02.438
Huh.

29:23.579 --> 29:26.215
***

29:26.490 --> 29:28.027
Um, well, as everybody in this room knows,

29:28.028 --> 29:30.071
Deacon and I go back a long time.

29:34.092 --> 29:35.434
If there was no Deacon Claybourne,

29:35.435 --> 29:36.998
there would be no Rayna Jaymes.

29:39.994 --> 29:41.734

29:43.452 --> 29:45.864

Not Deacon's party.

33:49.419 --> 33:50.904
Yeah, since I'm here, you wanna talk?

33:56.688 --> 33:57.532
How you doing?

33:58.255 --> 33:59.179
Fine.

34:01.391 --> 34:03.675
Why was it so important for
you to throw this party?

34:09.568 --> 34:11.531
You wanna tell me about your 9th birthday?

34:15.376 --> 34:17.196
Well, she obviously already
told you about it.

34:18.725 --> 34:20.027
I didn't get your side of it.

34:25.248 --> 34:26.940
I had never had one before.

34:28.369 --> 34:32.509
She rented out the party room
at Dewey's ice cream parlor.

34:35.518 --> 34:38.172
And three days before, she...

34:39.745 --> 34:41.340
Walked in high as a kite.

34:42.594 --> 34:45.357
Said we had to cancel it
because we couldn't afford it.

34:46.655 --> 34:47.835
She'd spent all the money.

34:50.623 --> 34:51.978
She wasn't even sorry.

34:54.094 --> 34:55.130
And you left.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.775
I didn't wanna be around her.

35:03.321 --> 35:04.358
I, uh...

35:05.865 --> 35:07.731
I came home a few hours later.

35:09.913 --> 35:11.077
And she'd passed out

35:11.192 --> 35:12.581
with a cigarette in her hand.

35:14.376 --> 35:15.525
It was still lit.

35:17.322 --> 35:21.004
There was... a little
flickering patch of carpet

35:21.005 --> 35:22.459
where the ambers were dropping.

35:26.973 --> 35:28.603
I thought about leaving again.

35:31.775 --> 35:32.697
What did you do?

35:36.479 --> 35:37.402
I put it out.

35:45.406 --> 35:46.609
The truth is...

35:51.087 --> 35:52.603
I wanted her to die.

35:58.077 --> 35:59.803
You really think you can help us?

36:01.675 --> 36:02.432
I do.

36:10.520 --> 36:11.556
How was your birthday?

36:12.712 --> 36:13.572
Wasn't too bad.

36:14.407 --> 36:15.174
Good.

36:17.047 --> 36:18.870
I wish you'd told me about the divorce.

36:19.913 --> 36:22.836
I am really sorry that I didn't tell you.

36:25.223 --> 36:28.451
My life kinda blew up
that night in Chicago.

36:31.312 --> 36:33.997
And I never wanted to
drag you into all this.

36:36.896 --> 36:37.723
How are you doing?

36:39.599 --> 36:40.524
I don't know.

36:43.088 --> 36:45.323
Looking at a world full of question marks,

36:46.336 --> 36:47.803
trying to take care of everybody.

36:49.792 --> 36:51.900
Figure out where I stand
in the middle of it all.

36:52.395 --> 36:53.269
Well...

36:55.018 --> 36:56.468
It sure made for a pretty song.

37:10.970 --> 37:12.327
I wanna do right by you.

37:16.586 --> 37:17.732
Happy Birthday.

37:20.394 --> 37:21.431
Thank you.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.764
Hey, hip-hop. Hey.

37:39.765 --> 37:41.023
Something wrong with the guitar?

37:41.058 --> 37:42.577
Nah, man. It sounds great.

37:42.578 --> 37:44.881
Just... you know, impulse buy.

37:44.882 --> 37:46.447
Yeah, no problem. Well,
you wanna return it?

37:46.448 --> 37:49.185
Yeah, but give me a second.
I wanna look around.

37:49.186 --> 37:50.641
See if something else feels right. Yeah.

37:50.642 --> 37:51.934
All right, go on.

37:55.444 --> 38:01.073
?So I laid my body down

38:05.604 --> 38:06.559
there's more?

38:07.207 --> 38:09.297
Juliette asked me to drop
off your birthday present.

38:09.991 --> 38:11.873
Look, I know you had a lot
to do with last night.

38:11.887 --> 38:13.438
Oh, hell, you probably did all of it,

38:13.439 --> 38:15.564
so... thank you.

38:15.828 --> 38:16.845
So you had a good time?

38:16.945 --> 38:18.256
I did have a good time, yeah.

38:18.257 --> 38:19.647
Don't tell her, though, okay?

38:19.681 --> 38:21.086
I don't want this to become annual.

38:21.137 --> 38:22.142
You got it.

38:22.497 --> 38:23.646
"Happy Birthday."

38:25.234 --> 38:27.522
"You of all people deserve
some unconditional love.

38:27.523 --> 38:29.341
P.S. He's welcome on the road."

38:30.849 --> 38:31.552
Who's welcome on the...

38:31.652 --> 38:32.751
come here, buddy.

38:33.860 --> 38:34.911
A dog?

38:36.387 --> 38:37.090
Here.

38:37.091 --> 38:39.215
I don't want a dog, Emily.

38:39.683 --> 38:42.643
She said you'd say that.
She also said to tell you

38:42.644 --> 38:44.259
to shut up and take the dog.

38:47.141 --> 38:49.312
Hey, what am I supposed to do with this?

38:51.061 --> 38:52.846
Love him, I think.

38:57.830 --> 38:58.753
Mr. mayor.

38:59.782 --> 39:02.594
Hey, there he is. Come on in, Cole.

39:03.638 --> 39:04.786
Please have a seat.

39:05.799 --> 39:07.921
I was beginning to think you
were gonna stand me up.

39:08.743 --> 39:10.050
Well, the thought did cross my mind.

39:10.854 --> 39:13.827
I have to say, uh, sorry to hear
about you and Rayna. Thank you.

39:14.213 --> 39:16.274
I hope that's not the reason
you asked me in today.

39:16.279 --> 39:17.850
No, no, no. It's not.

39:18.278 --> 39:19.684
Though in days gone by,

39:19.685 --> 39:21.777
I would've appreciated your
friendship during all this.

39:22.550 --> 39:23.538
Your counsel.

39:24.214 --> 39:26.930
Well, if you're asking me to
choose between you and Rayna,

39:27.046 --> 39:29.733
I'm team Rayna, even though
I doubt she'd have me now.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.584
Oh, she still cares about you, Coleman,

39:32.086 --> 39:32.961
and so do I.

39:33.942 --> 39:36.340
I never imagined how
ugly this would all get,

39:36.341 --> 39:38.770
and... for that, I'm truly sorry

39:39.046 --> 39:40.624
for you and Audrey and your family.

39:41.286 --> 39:43.125
But you know, they say hindsight's 20/20,

39:43.126 --> 39:45.091
and I see things more clearly now,

39:45.302 --> 39:46.881
and I've given this a lot of thought.

39:47.798 --> 39:49.410
I'd like you to be my deputy mayor,

39:52.678 --> 39:53.600
what?

39:53.670 --> 39:54.960
I'm offering you the job.

39:55.766 --> 39:56.866
Because, like you,

39:57.046 --> 39:59.589
I've now seen firsthand
how lamar does business,

39:59.590 --> 40:00.846
and I want no part of it,

40:01.094 --> 40:02.961
personally or for my constituents,

40:03.608 --> 40:05.586
and I'm pretty sure you feel the same way.

40:08.727 --> 40:09.683
So...

40:11.138 --> 40:12.003
What do you say?

40:13.589 --> 40:14.852
Deputy mayor.

40:34.579 --> 40:35.983
Where have you been since last night?

40:37.571 --> 40:38.495
I've been calling...

40:47.571 --> 40:48.495
What happened?

40:51.091 --> 40:52.175
It's Jason.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.264
Police found him in an alley last night...

41:02.531 --> 41:03.756
Beaten to death.

41:07.764 --> 41:08.689
Oh, Gunnar...

41:10.180 --> 41:11.183
I kicked him out.

41:14.068 --> 41:15.215
I got rid of his gun.

41:16.210 --> 41:17.792
He had no way to defend himself.

41:19.378 --> 41:20.368
No, no, no, no.

41:21.587 --> 41:22.688
It's not your fault.

41:23.892 --> 41:25.103
Whose fault is it, then?
