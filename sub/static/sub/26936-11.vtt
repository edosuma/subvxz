04:03.611 --> 04:05.611
  use of the L-shaped structure

04:05.713 --> 04:07.646
      -No. Not-not at all.

 it might be packed, doesn't it?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.874
   Lot of clay up against it,
         it looks like.

04:39.013 --> 04:41.613
          It looks like
  they might have packed clay.

04:41.715 --> 04:44.082
          Look at that.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.184
It's not the good stuff, though.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.655
   -RICK: It's quite granular.
             -Yeah.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.257
       Yeah, look, there's
    a lot of rock in it, too.

04:52.359 --> 04:54.960
    They might have just used
     what they had on hand.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.262
       CRAIG: I don't know
 if they drove it into the sand

04:57.364 --> 04:59.231
       and then took rocks
         up against it?

04:59.333 --> 05:01.833
  RICK: It sure seems that way,
        because, I mean,

05:01.935 --> 05:03.869
       it's an inordinate
         amount of rock.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.240
      Looks like they tried
           to pack it.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.277

05:35.369 --> 05:37.035
  It's an open-ended structure.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.338
 It's not connected to anything.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.107
      If this is some sort

          prevention...

05:44.345 --> 05:46.378

     What are we looking at?

          what we did.
            -Please.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.782
         So, we started
  with three individual scans,

07:30.884 --> 07:32.784
 and then we unified those scans

07:32.886 --> 07:35.487
          into a model
      of the entire stone.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.256
         So from there,
      two things stood out.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.725
       The first thing is
         this flat area.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.795
   It was an area that we did
   a little bit of analysis on

07:43.897 --> 07:45.430
      and found that it was
         perfectly flat.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.065
   Too straight to be natural.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.001
    Which leads us to believe
    that potentially this was

07:50.103 --> 07:52.604
     carved out and cleaved
          at one point.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.573
       We've done our best

07:54.675 --> 07:57.809
      to zoom in and create
     some kind of a pattern

07:57.911 --> 08:01.580
   out of these marks that go
perpendicular to that flat area.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.815
            They have
  a relatively linear spacing.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.617
        We didn't notice
       any cross features

08:05.719 --> 08:07.619
       that would indicate
        English letters,

08:07.721 --> 08:09.521
   but, um, there's definitely
     some peculiar markings

08:09.623 --> 08:11.523
        along that face.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.625
    Doug, what do you think?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.727
         (clears throat)
              Um...

08:15.829 --> 08:19.965
 a friend of mine introduced me
   to, uh, futhark one time--

08:20.067 --> 08:22.901
     it's a runic language--
  and that's what I kind of see

08:23.003 --> 08:26.071
      in what Rob and Ryan
    have brought out on that,

08:26.173 --> 08:29.107
          is that type
    of runic language, so...

08:29.209 --> 08:32.177
            NARRATOR:
 <i> Runic carvings on Oak Island?</i>

08:32.279 --> 08:36.581
      <i> Dating back as early</i>
   <i> as the first century A.D.,</i>

08:36.683 --> 08:39.551
       <i> the runic language</i>
       <i> known as "futhark"</i>

08:39.653 --> 08:42.153
 <i> was a primitive alphabet used</i>
     <i> by the Germanic tribes</i>

08:42.256 --> 08:43.788
      <i> of northern Europe,</i>

08:43.890 --> 08:46.691
           <i> as well as</i>
    <i> in ancient Scandinavia.</i>

08:46.793 --> 08:49.995
<i>Consisting of etched characters</i>
        <i> called "runes,"</i>

08:50.097 --> 08:52.631
          <i> the purpose</i>
     <i> of these inscriptions</i>

08:52.733 --> 08:54.332
   <i> ranged from everyday uses</i>

08:54.434 --> 08:56.968
          <i> to religious</i>
   <i> and superstitious reasons,</i>

08:57.070 --> 09:00.539
   <i> such as a prayer or curse.</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:03.542
 <i> Could the mysterious carvings</i>
    <i> found near the Money Pit</i>

09:03.644 --> 09:07.212
      <i> on Lot 16 really be</i>
      <i> a runic inscription,</i>

09:07.314 --> 09:10.015
        <i> one dating back</i>
       <i> hundreds of years?</i>

09:10.117 --> 09:12.317
              RICK:
<i>The results are quite dramatic.</i>

09:12.419 --> 09:16.187
   They do indeed appear to be
       some sort of runes.

09:16.290 --> 09:18.056
  Runic symbolism, if you will.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.992
        <i> The hope is that</i>
   <i> we'll see these characters</i>

09:21.094 --> 09:23.228
          <i> in a new way</i>
   <i> and hopefully enhance them</i>

09:23.330 --> 09:25.196
 <i> to the point where we can have</i>

09:25.299 --> 09:26.765
     an expert look at them.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.568
   You know, they have a runic
 stone in... in Yarmouth Museum.

09:29.670 --> 09:32.304
  It used to be in the library,
   but now it's in the museum

09:32.406 --> 09:33.638
          -in Yarmouth.
         -Have they come

09:33.740 --> 09:35.807
       to an understanding
   of who might have done it?

09:35.909 --> 09:37.842
      Yeah. They-they said
       the Vikings did it.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.679
            NARRATOR:
    <i> Vikings? Is it possible</i>

09:40.781 --> 09:42.447
          <i> that Vikings</i>
   <i> could somehow be connected</i>

09:42.549 --> 09:45.183
   <i> to the Oak Island mystery?</i>

09:45.285 --> 09:48.787
        <i> From the eighth</i>
     <i> to 11th century A.D.,</i>

09:48.889 --> 09:51.389
     <i> the seafaring warriors</i>
      <i> known as the Vikings</i>

09:51.491 --> 09:55.193
<i>were active throughout the seas</i>
      <i> of medieval Europe.</i>

09:55.295 --> 09:58.630
    <i> Famed for their sailing</i>
   <i> and navigation abilities,</i>

09:58.732 --> 10:02.634
  <i> there is evidence to suggest</i>
  <i> their activities also spread</i>

10:02.736 --> 10:04.769
 <i> as far west as North America,</i>

10:04.871 --> 10:08.006
    <i> beginning with the Norse</i>
     <i> explorer Leif Erikson,</i>

10:08.108 --> 10:10.609
        <i> who is believed</i>
<i>to have made landfall in Canada</i>

10:10.711 --> 10:13.712
   <i> sometime around 1000 A.D.</i>

10:13.814 --> 10:17.916
     We know, because of the
 archaeological community's work

10:18.018 --> 10:19.584
    in the maritimes, that...

10:19.686 --> 10:21.686
  <i> there are Viking settlements</i>
          <i> up and down</i>

10:21.788 --> 10:25.624
   <i> the length of Newfoundland</i>
    <i> and even in Nova Scotia.</i>

10:25.726 --> 10:28.560
       <i> So the possibility</i>
    <i> that Vikings were here,</i>

10:28.662 --> 10:30.295
      <i> it's not a stretch.</i>

10:30.397 --> 10:33.298
 We've never seen another stone
    like this on the island.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.567
    It opens now up the door
         of possibility

10:35.669 --> 10:38.970
        to another entity
 being involved here, you know?

10:39.072 --> 10:42.774
     Vikings, which we have
     never really explored.

10:42.876 --> 10:45.644
       Anyway, Rob, Ryan,
     we thank you very much,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.946
   and if you'd be kind enough
  to leave us the information,

10:48.048 --> 10:50.215
     I think we'll follow up
     in a multitude of ways.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.583
           Absolutely.
     Yeah, I'd appreciate it

10:51.685 --> 10:53.485
 if this was sent to the experts
           and we get

10:53.587 --> 10:54.753
     something valuable back
           out of it.

10:54.855 --> 10:55.954
      Oh, you'll-you'll...
     you'll have an answer.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.389
       -ROB H.: Very good.
        -I guarantee you.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.857
       -ALEX: And a bunch
         more questions.
          -And a bunch

10:58.959 --> 11:00.025
        -more questions.
          -(all laugh)

11:03.697 --> 11:05.397
     Ooh, that sounds good.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.633
      Ooh! Check this out.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.802

    It's got a design on it.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.672
          -We could be
      onto something, mate.
    -It could be significant.

          TERRY: Yeah,
   they're not quite as thick.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.907
          Interesting.

11:49.009 --> 11:52.143
 TERRY: Yeah. It's a little more
   extensive than we thought.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.412
       At least a little.
   Maybe a lot more extensive.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.014
   Well, as Craig pointed out,

11:56.116 --> 11:58.316
    it's kind of paralleling
  the U-shaped structure, too.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.751
             -Yeah.
  -I guess we'll just continue

11:59.853 --> 12:01.119

12:01.221 --> 12:02.554

15:27.694 --> 15:29.527
    <i> Rick, Craig and the team</i>

15:29.629 --> 15:31.496
      <i> believed they found</i>
         <i> their target.</i>

15:31.598 --> 15:33.264
             CRAIG:
    I think he hit the tunnel

15:33.366 --> 15:34.832
         from Shaft Six.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.002
            NARRATOR:
     <i> But finding Shaft Six</i>

15:38.104 --> 15:40.271

       <i> the exact location</i>

   <i> of the original Money Pit</i>
    <i> are not the same thing.</i>

15:44.277 --> 15:47.111
    <i> The team will still need</i>
     <i> to drill several holes</i>

15:47.213 --> 15:49.213
   <i> around the Shaft Six site</i>

15:49.316 --> 15:51.983
  <i> before they will be certain</i>
    <i> they have finally found</i>

15:52.085 --> 15:54.752
  <i> the elusive treasure shaft.</i>

15:54.854 --> 15:57.722
     RICK: What looms large
       in the near future

15:57.824 --> 15:59.157
   is putting down a large can

15:59.259 --> 16:01.626
    and/or several small cans
         to investigate

16:01.728 --> 16:03.227
          -these areas.
        -Oh, absolutely.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.663
              RICK:
    Craig, what would you do?

16:05.765 --> 16:07.598
        Would you target
       one singular area,

16:07.701 --> 16:10.134
    or would you take a shot
       at a couple three?

16:10.236 --> 16:13.338
     -I'd do multiple cans.
             -Right.

16:13.440 --> 16:16.474
  I like the Shaft Six tunnel,

16:16.576 --> 16:18.209
         following that.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.610
        Finding Shaft Six
      could really help us

16:19.713 --> 16:21.012
   -zero in on the Money Pit.
        -MARTY: It could.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.081
    Well, you'd at least know
           the tunnel,

16:23.183 --> 16:26.551
 it has to be within that spot,
     so I'm okay with that.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.019
     The way to uncorkscrew
          the Money Pit

16:28.121 --> 16:31.556
   -is finding the Tunnel Six.
              -Yep.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.225
 Everybody's on board with Rick
  that we got to look for where

16:34.327 --> 16:36.961
    the tunnel from Shaft Six
     entered the Money Pit.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.797
      RICK: <i> So, we've done</i>
      <i> as much as we can do</i>

16:39.899 --> 16:41.532
     <i> to come to a consensus</i>

16:41.634 --> 16:44.769
<i>as to where to pin this tunnel,</i>
         <i> this location.</i>

16:44.871 --> 16:46.371
        It's time to dig.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.539
          -So, brother?
             -Yeah.

16:48.641 --> 16:49.741
      Where are you going?

16:49.843 --> 16:51.342
         Well, you know
       what I want to do.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.944
   -I want to dig right here.
     -I know what you want.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.112
           (all laugh)

16:54.214 --> 16:55.747
    Well, I know you started

16:55.849 --> 16:58.349
    with very focused on H-8.

16:58.451 --> 17:01.419
             MARTY:
  I want to have a re-go at H-8

17:01.521 --> 17:04.521
      and see if that stuff
  we pushed away comes back in.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.457
  I don't know why it wouldn't.
           It should.

17:06.559 --> 17:09.460
  And then we can try and find
 the stuff we missed last time.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.862
              Yeah.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.964
        H-8 still remains
  the-the primary, if you will.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.099
             I mean,
  we just found too many things

17:16.202 --> 17:17.702
       to-to let that go.

17:17.804 --> 17:22.106
NARRATOR: <i> Last year, Rick, Marty</i>
    <i> and the Oak Island team</i>

17:22.208 --> 17:24.442
         <i> made a number</i>
   <i> of incredible discoveries</i>

17:24.544 --> 17:27.145
        <i> while searching</i>
    <i> through the H-8 spoils,</i>

17:27.247 --> 17:30.248
<i>including 18th-century pottery.</i>

17:30.350 --> 17:33.351
   Oh, a bit of pottery. Look.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.454
  NARRATOR: <i> They also unearthed</i>
    <i> fragments of parchment,</i>

17:36.556 --> 17:38.423
      <i> leather bookbinding,</i>

17:38.525 --> 17:41.826
     <i> and even human bones,</i>
      <i> which, when tested,</i>

17:41.928 --> 17:44.762
        <i> were identified</i>
 <i> to be the 17th-century remains</i>

17:44.864 --> 17:47.331
 <i> of two different individuals,</i>

17:47.434 --> 17:49.167
        <i> one from Europe</i>

17:49.269 --> 17:51.636
 <i> and one from the Middle East.</i>

17:51.738 --> 17:55.039
    We drilled the little H-8
  and found all kinds of stuff.

17:55.141 --> 17:59.110
 <i> I for sure think we're in the</i>
  <i> original Money Pit with H-8.</i>

17:59.212 --> 18:02.046
       <i> And then we put in</i>
        <i> the big canister</i>

18:02.148 --> 18:03.681
     <i> and didn't really get</i>
       <i> much of anything.</i>

18:03.783 --> 18:06.584
          <i> So we think</i>
    <i> we need to try and find</i>

18:06.686 --> 18:08.419
        <i> what was missing</i>
        <i> from last year.</i>

18:08.521 --> 18:10.988
  So that's mission number one.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.657
   We now have a battle plan,
             surely,

18:12.759 --> 18:14.559
          or an outline
    as to what we want to do.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.227
     Now we need to get back
        to Irving and ROC

18:16.329 --> 18:17.662
             and see
  if we can't make this happen.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.130
             -Yeah.
       -MARTY: Okay, good.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.666
     Well, let's quit jawing
   and start doing something.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.201
    DAVE: Get something done.
   That's right. I'm with you.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.702
             -100%.
             -Okay.

18:24.804 --> 18:27.405
        -RICK: <i> Let's go.</i>
       -CHARLES: <i> Let's go.</i>

18:28.875 --> 18:30.041
            VANESSA:
     <i> Hey, boys, we're here.</i>

18:30.143 --> 18:31.509
 What's the plan for this year?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.478
  RICK: <i> It's all about finding</i>
         <i> the one thing,</i>

18:33.580 --> 18:34.912
             proving
   the Oak Island story real.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.380
            You know,
    I think we all want that.

18:36.483 --> 18:37.548
           All of us.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.489

        <i> on Oak Island...</i>

              RICK:
      <i> Lookee here, David.</i>

18:48.795 --> 18:51.095
    NARRATOR: <i> ...as brothers</i>

   -DANNY: Good. How are you?

18:59.005 --> 18:59.871
Good to see you. Hello, Vanessa.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.839

19:01.941 --> 19:03.975
             MARTY:
     Hey, man. Welcome back.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.643
           -Thank you.
        -Good to see you.
       How do you do, sir?

19:05.745 --> 19:06.711
      -I'm Marty. Hi, John.
             -John.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.712
       -Nice to meet you.
         -How you been?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.647
Bring that big oscillator thing?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.048
   -Yeah, we brought a parade.
          -(all laugh)

19:11.151 --> 19:12.483
          I don't know
   if you noticed this, but...

            NARRATOR:
       <i> Today, in addition</i>

19:14.554 --> 19:16.320

     <i> of digging equipment,</i>

19:16.422 --> 19:19.257
          <i> the ROC team</i>
     <i> has once again brought</i>

19:19.359 --> 19:23.861
  <i> their 50,000-pound rotating</i>
   <i> oscillator to Oak Island.</i>

19:23.963 --> 19:27.932
    <i> Capable of applying some</i>
<i>three million pounds of torque,</i>

19:28.034 --> 19:31.536
     <i> this powerful machine</i>
 <i> will allow the Oak Island team</i>

19:31.638 --> 19:35.139

          <i> ROC, R-O-C,</i>

19:41.381 --> 19:44.549
 <i> is bringing in the oscillator,</i>
      <i> and that's exciting</i>

19:44.651 --> 19:47.451
 <i> because we've put a tremendous</i>
      <i> amount of resources,</i>

19:47.554 --> 19:48.953
    time, money, everything,

19:49.055 --> 19:52.023
         into gathering
      all the data we can.

19:52.125 --> 19:54.992
   <i> And now, using that data,</i>
     <i> we know where to dig.</i>

19:55.094 --> 19:56.594
   The treasure hunt resumes.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.762
         The hunt is on.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.497
      So, boys, we're here.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.032
         I'm about ready
     to break my crew loose

20:01.134 --> 20:03.467
 to go get their safety gear on,
  start unloading those trucks,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.069
       but what's the plan
         for this year?

20:05.171 --> 20:06.938
       Let's go over there
        and take a look.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.610
  You're gonna have to make the
decision where we start, really,

20:12.712 --> 20:15.346
       because, you know,
  we all have interest in H-8.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.950
 We collectively were never able
 to explain what happened there.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.018
    Yeah, that was, you know,
       rather frustrating

20:21.120 --> 20:23.588
  -for us, as well, last year.
     -That's it right there.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.726
         MARTY: <i> We know</i>
 <i> that the Money Pit collapsed.</i>

20:28.828 --> 20:30.461
  So, this could be the vault.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.265
      NARRATOR: <i> Last year,</i>
     <i> in addition to finding</i>

20:34.367 --> 20:37.068

      <i> the Oak Island team</i>

20:37.170 --> 20:38.669

  <i> and Frederick Blair in 1897.</i>

20:52.452 --> 20:55.119
      DANNY: <i> We're 170 pipe</i>
    <i> in the ground right now.</i>

20:55.221 --> 20:56.921
    We are definitely sitting
          on something

20:57.023 --> 21:00.858
   that we haven't cut before
  since we've been on this job.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.362

   It's still in there, then.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.045
    -That what you're saying?
-CRAIG: Just pushed to the side.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.014
   So the hatch we dug through

21:23.116 --> 21:25.016
  -has been pushed to the side?
            -Exactly.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.488
             MARTY:
<i>H-8 was a big enigma last year.</i>

21:30.590 --> 21:32.890
          <i> We had some</i>
    <i> peculiar things happen.</i>

21:32.992 --> 21:34.225
     We think maybe the plug

21:34.327 --> 21:35.993
   that's supposed to come up
         in the canister

21:36.095 --> 21:37.695
  got pushed away into a void.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.131
    <i> So we're going to start</i>
   <i> manipulating H-8 somewhat.</i>

21:40.233 --> 21:43.868
          <i> Pick it up,</i>
<i>maybe go back down, try and get</i>

21:43.970 --> 21:47.738
  <i> whatever got pushed away to</i>
<i>come back in so we can grab it.</i>

21:47.840 --> 21:51.008
    Do you have a depth that
we're thinking of pulling up to?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.843
          I would first
     hammer-grab inside it.

21:52.945 --> 21:55.212
       We don't know what
   might have come in, right?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.380
            -I agree.
        -So I'd first...

21:56.482 --> 21:57.848
      first hammer-grab it
        right to bottom.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.318
            -Mm-hmm.
   -Then I would pull it up...

22:00.420 --> 22:02.586
  eight feet, ten feet, maybe,

22:02.689 --> 22:06.290
         see what might
       reverse in. Right?

22:06.392 --> 22:07.491
             -Okay.
        -Because we lost,

22:07.593 --> 22:08.592
       we know we lost it.

22:08.695 --> 22:09.794
  We pushed the plug somewhere.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.229
             -Yeah.
 -Yeah, the sort of image I have

22:12.332 --> 22:14.632
     -is it went like that.
            -Mm-hmm.

 So, I think the idea is to grab

22:46.332 --> 22:48.699
    whatever might come into
  that pipe from the vicinity,

22:48.801 --> 22:51.502

       without spending...

22:51.604 --> 22:54.138
           (chuckles):
   the rest of the year here.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.873
   So, it's all about finding
         the one thing,

22:55.975 --> 22:57.842
             proving
   the Oak Island story real.

22:57.944 --> 23:00.611
        You know? I think
  we all want that, all of us.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.780
  Let's get back to work, then.

23:09.355 --> 23:10.354
              Whoa.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.456
  There's a timber right there.

23:12.558 --> 23:15.426
      There's another beam
          right there.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.061
          I don't know.
      That's very strange.

    Yeah. Wow, look at that.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.272

      what type of language
     that they think this is

25:08.341 --> 25:09.707

     whether they're Basque

25:09.809 --> 25:10.941

 -Oh. Nice to meet you, Nadine.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.451
           -I'm Paul.
  -I'm director for the museum.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.720
           Welcome to
   the Yarmouth County Museum.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.221
      So, you're interested
       in the runic stone?

25:24.323 --> 25:26.423
        ALEX: Yes, we're
     very interested. Yeah.

25:26.526 --> 25:27.625
        The reason we're
     so interested in this,

25:27.727 --> 25:29.560
   um, on Oak Island we found

25:29.662 --> 25:31.695
    a somewhat similar stone,
            actually.

25:31.797 --> 25:33.297
             -Okay.
 -And it looks similar to this.

25:33.399 --> 25:34.899
    It's got a flat surface,

25:35.001 --> 25:37.034
what may be an inscription here.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.670
       We actually put it
  through some lidar software,

25:39.772 --> 25:42.106
  and we came up with something
   that looks a lot like that.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.875
     -LISETTE; Hmm. Mm-hmm.
     -NADINE: Very similar.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.977
   PAUL: We would like to hear
        a little bit more

25:47.079 --> 25:48.913
       about the language
      and the translation.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.848
        Is there at least
    a few languages that it's

25:50.950 --> 25:53.183
      been narrowed down to
as possibilities for your stone?

25:53.286 --> 25:54.485
             -Norse.
             -Yeah.

25:54.587 --> 25:55.819
    Norse is probably the...

25:55.922 --> 25:56.887
 the one that's the most common.

25:56.989 --> 25:57.955
     That's what we thought.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.557
        -Yeah, for sure.
             -Yeah.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.659
 NADINE: Well, the translation,
          I think, um,

26:01.761 --> 26:04.495
      at first was roughly
         "Leif to Erik."

26:05.865 --> 26:07.064
    Erik the Red, of course.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.799
     So that would lead you
         to the Vikings

26:08.901 --> 26:10.634
          and that they
     had visited this area.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.036
             Right.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.371
            NARRATOR:
    <i> Although little is known</i>

26:14.473 --> 26:17.808

  <i> of Vikings in North America,</i>

26:17.910 --> 26:20.744

26:27.019 --> 26:29.687

  <i> offers evidence that Vikings</i>

26:33.993 --> 26:36.226

26:36.329 --> 26:38.862
 <i> could the stone that the team</i>
    <i> found near the Money Pit</i>

26:38.965 --> 26:42.900
     <i> similarly suggest that</i>
 <i> they also visited Oak Island?</i>

26:43.002 --> 26:44.702
          We're looking
      at Basque and futhark

26:44.804 --> 26:47.304
       as being a possible
      interpretation of it.

26:47.373 --> 26:49.106
       But it seems to be
       slightly different

26:49.208 --> 26:51.008
       from the one that's
     actually on your stone,

26:51.110 --> 26:52.943
      which is a little bit
         more curvaceous

26:53.045 --> 26:55.446
          than the ones
     that are on our stone.

26:55.548 --> 26:57.748
          ALEX: <i> Looking</i>
  <i> at the Yarmouth Runic Stone,</i>

 <i> there are some similarities to</i>
<i>the stone that we found, but...</i>

27:00.453 --> 27:03.220
        the characters on

27:03.322 --> 27:05.255
       a lot more complex.

27:05.358 --> 27:08.125
    <i> They seem to kind of be</i>

27:08.227 --> 27:10.628

29:27.767 --> 29:29.933
     I still have cofferdam
           in my mind.

29:30.035 --> 29:31.335
           -Cofferdam.
             -Yeah.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.337
 What about the question of age?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.405
    I mean, is there anything
     other than, you know...

29:35.508 --> 29:36.774
      Obviously, we can do
         a couple things

29:36.876 --> 29:38.375
         -with the wood.
              -Yes.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.444
Is there any other way to figure
   out how old this thing is?

29:40.546 --> 29:42.312
        LAIRD: You know,
   this construction technique

29:42.414 --> 29:43.947
           is unique.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.016
   You know, the use of pegs,
         perhaps that...

29:46.118 --> 29:48.185
            -Uh-huh.
      -...gives us a clue.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.721
       You know, the lack
     of iron fasteners is...

29:50.823 --> 29:52.089
          -It's weird.
       -It's really weird.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.891
     Gary and I were talking
        about that, too.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.993
 (laughs): I would have thought
    they'd be all over this.

29:56.095 --> 29:58.228
 ALEX: So, this, I mean, really
   what you're saying, though,

29:58.330 --> 30:00.330
     is that this is unique,
      this is not something

30:00.432 --> 30:02.366
   -you'd find anywhere else.
        -Oh, yeah. Yeah.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.967
      No, archaeologically,

30:04.069 --> 30:07.204
      I don't think anyone
 in Nova Scotia's seen this. No.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.673
  RICK: <i> You know, we're finding</i>
   <i> structure after structure</i>

30:09.775 --> 30:13.277

<i>of archaeological significance.</i>

30:13.379 --> 30:16.046
         I was very glad
        to hear Laird say

30:16.148 --> 30:17.981
     <i> that this one appears</i>
       <i> to have, you know,</i>

30:18.083 --> 30:19.783

30:19.885 --> 30:21.752
     <i> Could be significant.</i>
  <i> Could be highly significant.</i>

30:21.854 --> 30:23.720
   <i> So we need to investigate.</i>

30:23.823 --> 30:25.255
       And that's exactly
        what we're doing.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.798
       If it's original--
   and I don't think you're...

30:34.900 --> 30:36.500
You're not at that point, right?

30:36.602 --> 30:38.202
         You don't think
        this is original.

30:38.304 --> 30:40.938
      You know, I thought,
based on the U-shaped structure,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.040
   it was probably searcher...

30:43.142 --> 30:46.677
    until we hit the L-shaped
      structure or expanded

30:46.779 --> 30:48.445
     the L-shaped structure.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.113
    And now I'm on the fence.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.649
            -Really?
             -Yeah.

30:52.751 --> 30:56.620
    RICK: We're gonna let him
  just kind of peel this away.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.856
            -Mm-hmm.
       -And then we'll...

30:58.958 --> 31:01.024

            from what
  we've encountered down there.

32:34.086 --> 32:38.255
  Well, the logs are basically
      rollers, if you will.

32:38.357 --> 32:40.557
      It's like a slipway.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.225
     That kind of signifies
      there's quite a load.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.461
    Or quite a load expected.

32:45.731 --> 32:48.231
 This could be the Hedden Wharf.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.302
            NARRATOR:
            <i> In 1936,</i>

32:52.404 --> 32:55.906
   <i> Oak Island treasure hunter</i>
   <i> Gilbert Hedden constructed</i>

32:56.008 --> 32:59.476
    <i> a wharf at Smith's Cove</i>
        <i> in anticipation</i>

32:59.578 --> 33:01.244
   <i> of the massive excavation</i>
      <i> he would soon begin</i>

33:01.347 --> 33:03.513
       <i> at the Money Pit.</i>

33:03.615 --> 33:05.983
      <i> Because the causeway</i>
    <i> that connects Oak Island</i>

33:06.085 --> 33:09.052
        <i> to the mainland</i>
    <i> had not yet been built,</i>

33:09.154 --> 33:11.188
<i>Hedden needed a place for boats</i>

33:11.290 --> 33:13.924
         <i> to safely dock</i>
   <i> and off-load their cargo.</i>

33:14.026 --> 33:17.861
   <i> While working at low-tide,</i>
      <i> Hedden and his team</i>

33:17.963 --> 33:20.297
          <i> were shocked</i>
 <i> to discover two large timbers</i>

33:20.399 --> 33:25.168
<i>protruding from the rocks, held</i>
 <i> together by large wooden pegs.</i>

33:25.270 --> 33:28.438
    <i> Upon closer inspection,</i>
        <i> he also noticed</i>

33:28.540 --> 33:31.541
      <i> what appeared to be</i>
 <i> strange markings on the logs,</i>

33:31.643 --> 33:33.543
   <i> leading Hedden to conclude</i>

33:33.645 --> 33:35.512
       <i> that the structure</i>
       <i> had once been used</i>

33:35.614 --> 33:37.914
    <i> as an ancient boat slip.</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:41.485
     <i> Unfortunately, because</i>
  <i> Hedden lacked the resources</i>

33:41.587 --> 33:43.754
<i>to dig below the low-tide mark,</i>

33:43.856 --> 33:46.857
         <i> he was forced</i>
 <i> to abandon his investigation.</i>

33:46.959 --> 33:49.926
          <i> As a result,</i>
    <i> the so-called "slipway"</i>

33:50.029 --> 33:53.063

33:53.165 --> 33:54.865
              RICK:
       Look at that thing!

33:54.967 --> 33:56.666
           -It's huge.
        -LAIRD: Oh, yeah.

33:56.769 --> 33:58.068
    That's quite intriguing.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.803
              ALEX:
    Well, according to Laird,

33:59.905 --> 34:02.406
  construction technique is our
best shot at dating this, right?

34:02.508 --> 34:04.608
       RICK: I don't know.
      That's very strange.

34:04.710 --> 34:08.512
     No fasteners. I suppose
   they may have rotted away.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.847
   There's a break right here,

34:10.949 --> 34:13.083
   and then it picks up again
          right there.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.185
              ALEX:
     That seems deliberate.

34:15.286 --> 34:19.822
  When Hedden put his wharf in,
  he obviously found something.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.690
             LAIRD:
             He did.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.360
              RICK:
   Historically, Hedden built

34:23.462 --> 34:26.029
  his wharf on top of something
         that he found.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.232
  -And this is where that was?
              -Yes,

34:29.333 --> 34:32.002
    but he never, uh, sought
    to determine what that...

34:32.103 --> 34:33.804
    what he was building on.

34:33.906 --> 34:39.009
       So, are we standing
        on his construct,

34:39.110 --> 34:41.143
     something he built on?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.612
     From that perspective,

34:42.714 --> 34:44.380
      -we know very little.
             -Yeah.

34:44.483 --> 34:47.650
  NARRATOR: <i> Could the team have</i>
     <i> just found the slipway</i>

34:47.753 --> 34:51.254
         <i> first reported</i>
   <i> by Gilbert Hedden in 1936?</i>

34:51.356 --> 34:53.657
          <i> And, if so,</i>
    <i> who might have built it?</i>

34:53.759 --> 34:56.460
     <i> And for what purpose?</i>

34:56.562 --> 34:59.196
         RICK: <i> You know,</i>
  <i> we're confused again because</i>

34:59.298 --> 35:01.665
     there are no fasteners
           associated

35:01.767 --> 35:04.601
   with the horizontal members
         of the slipway,

35:04.703 --> 35:07.204
  <i> and, uh, it's the same thing</i>
 <i> with the U-shaped structure--</i>

35:07.306 --> 35:08.839
      <i> no metal fasteners.</i>

35:08.941 --> 35:10.340
          <i> The slipway,</i>
     <i> at this point, becomes</i>

35:10.442 --> 35:13.577
            <i> an area</i>
    <i> of significant interest.</i>

35:13.679 --> 35:15.846
    But this is kind of right
  where the L-shaped structure

35:15.948 --> 35:17.280
   should continue to, right?

35:17.382 --> 35:22.385
 So, aren't we on path at least
        to intercept it?

35:22.488 --> 35:24.221
      Again, we don't know
       where it comes in.

35:24.323 --> 35:28.391
       I mean, I would say
 we probably call the engineers

35:28.494 --> 35:29.860
  and see if we can't dig this

35:29.962 --> 35:31.962
     right to the sheet pile
     to see where this goes.

35:32.064 --> 35:33.763
        And as this goes,

35:33.866 --> 35:36.166
       see if we intercept
     the L-shaped structure.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.769
      You know, if this is
    at the same elevation as

35:39.872 --> 35:42.072
     the U-shaped structure,
       wouldn't that imply

35:42.174 --> 35:44.341
         they were built
       contemporaneously?

35:44.443 --> 35:47.110
   It would certainly build a
 strong argument for that, yeah.

35:47.212 --> 35:49.412
     ALEX: But they're both
   on the... the sea horizon.

35:49.515 --> 35:51.181
      That, to me, implies
     the same time, as well.

35:51.283 --> 35:54.251
       RICK: So, then, all
 we're left with is... (laughs)

35:54.353 --> 35:55.819
     ...when was that built?

35:57.222 --> 35:58.855
              RICK:
    <i> This structure is heavy.</i>

35:58.957 --> 36:01.291
      <i> It's well-built, uh,</i>

36:01.393 --> 36:03.260
             <i> built</i>
  <i> with large-dimension lumber,</i>

36:03.362 --> 36:07.364
     <i> and, uh, surely meant</i>
    <i> for a specific purpose.</i>

36:07.466 --> 36:10.967
 What that is, we don't have an
understanding of that as of yet.

36:11.069 --> 36:14.037
 There may still be crosspieces
      that he's sitting on,

36:14.139 --> 36:15.872
             -so...
             -Right.

36:17.543 --> 36:18.909
           RICK: Well,
 you have no choice but to keep

36:19.011 --> 36:21.011
       -peeling this off.
 -BILLY: Yeah, we'll just take,

36:21.113 --> 36:22.913

37:28.580 --> 37:30.247
   It's gonna be slow at first
 'cause we're gonna be twisting

37:30.349 --> 37:32.382
  right at the top of the can,
  and that's gonna take a while

37:32.484 --> 37:34.017
      to get it translated
    to the bottom of the can.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.619
    So, it's gonna be short,
         short strokes.

37:35.721 --> 37:37.621
        Probably up-heave
    up and down a little bit

37:37.723 --> 37:39.823
  to try to break that suction,
       and then just keep

37:39.925 --> 37:42.826
    -dancing it out of there.
         -Piece of cake.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.228
         -Piece of cake.
    -You run a tape in there

37:45.330 --> 37:47.998
    -to see where bottom was?
       -MIKE JARDINE: Yup.

37:48.100 --> 37:50.800
              -183.
              -183?
              -183?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.435
 That's quite a bit higher, eh?

37:52.537 --> 37:55.672
              -Yup.
 -What... where were we, and...?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.641
 You have about a 33-foot plug.

37:57.743 --> 37:59.776
     So, 33 feet of material
         up in the can.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.012
   Last year, when we left it,
   we left 15 feet of material

38:02.114 --> 38:04.114
          -in the can.
    -Something came in there.

38:04.216 --> 38:05.949
     -Yeah. It was sealed up
     pretty good, though...
           -Yeah, but

38:06.051 --> 38:08.885
  -where'd it come from, then?
-Well, it was below grade level,

38:08.987 --> 38:10.387
      so a lot of rainwater

38:10.489 --> 38:12.489
       and muck and stuff
    could have gone in there.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.191
 -Well, let's try and empty it.
             -Okay.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.660
            NARRATOR:
<i>Before their excavation efforts</i>

38:16.762 --> 38:18.561
        <i> can fully begin,</i>

38:18.664 --> 38:22.732
   <i> the team must first remove</i>
<i>over 30 feet of silt and debris</i>

38:22.834 --> 38:24.701
             <i> that,</i>
  <i> over the long winter months,</i>

38:24.803 --> 38:28.772
   <i> has settled and solidified</i>
<i>at the bottom of the H-8 shaft.</i>

38:28.874 --> 38:30.874
    <i> Once cleared of debris,</i>

38:30.976 --> 38:33.176
   <i> the massive steel caisson</i>
         <i> will be lifted</i>

38:33.278 --> 38:36.913
           <i> to a depth</i>
   <i> of approximately 170 feet</i>

38:37.015 --> 38:40.150
     <i> so that the three-ton</i>
  <i> hammer-grab tool can be used</i>

38:40.252 --> 38:43.586
    <i> to recover any important</i>
 <i> artifacts or possible treasure</i>

38:43.689 --> 38:45.689
 <i> that may have been pushed off</i>
          <i> to the side</i>

38:45.791 --> 38:48.958
 <i> during last year's excavation.</i>

38:49.061 --> 38:51.895
              RICK:
  <i> The real hunt begins in H-8.</i>

38:51.997 --> 38:53.830
    H-8 was quite an enigma.

38:53.932 --> 38:55.965
      It was the emotional
  roller coaster of Oak Island.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.101
           <i> You know,</i>
 <i> the disappearance of the plug,</i>

38:58.203 --> 38:59.536
        <i> the possibility</i>
      <i> that there's a void</i>

38:59.638 --> 39:03.173
   <i> and/or some sort of cave,</i>
            <i> cavern,</i>

39:03.275 --> 39:07.711
       <i> tunnel associated</i>
   <i> with the drop of the plug.</i>

39:07.813 --> 39:10.847
        <i> It's imperative</i>
<i>that we... that we do this work</i>

39:10.949 --> 39:14.117
          <i> and retrieve</i>
   <i> whatever it is down below</i>

39:14.219 --> 39:16.653
        <i> in its entirety.</i>

39:16.755 --> 39:18.688
       It's the silt, eh?

39:18.790 --> 39:20.724
  -MARTY: A lot of clay in it.
          -CRAIG: Yup.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.059
     That doesn't look like
    it came in from the top.

39:23.161 --> 39:26.930
      CRAIG: Yeah, the top
  would have everything in it.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.199
               Mm.

39:29.301 --> 39:32.168
  That, don't you think, would
  have to come from the bottom?

39:32.270 --> 39:34.404
       Yeah. I don't think
  that poured in from the top.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.605
        Well, maybe not.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.173
             CRAIG:
 Squishing it through the bottom

39:37.275 --> 39:38.808
 is the only thing I can think.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.510
      MARTY: Coming through
  a little crack in the bottom?

39:40.612 --> 39:42.579
     Just a tiny, tiny crack
   and pushing all the way up

39:42.681 --> 39:44.848
         -through, so...
    -MARTY: We built a giant

39:44.950 --> 39:47.951
    clay-purifying apparatus
         inadvertently.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.220
  Treasure of a different sort.

39:50.322 --> 39:52.722
             MARTY:
       It'd be really nice

39:52.824 --> 39:54.791
            if we get
    what we missed last year.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.127
 That's the whole purpose here,
        right, gentlemen?

39:57.229 --> 40:00.029
  It's not just what we missed.
       It's what we found.

40:00.132 --> 40:01.798
         What we missed
      from the first hole.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.767
            Oh, yeah.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.735
    -From the six-inch hole.
          -MARTY: Yeah.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.371
  We were hoping we'd get this,
       that and the other.

40:08.473 --> 40:09.939
    All we got was a mystery.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.442
         So, the idea is
      to find it this year.

40:12.544 --> 40:14.878
             MARTY:
     <i> In a very real sense,</i>

40:14.980 --> 40:18.615
   <i> the treasure hunt has been</i>
 <i> in advance here on Oak Island</i>

40:18.717 --> 40:20.216
<i>for a good part of this summer.</i>

40:20.318 --> 40:22.852
        <i> We've been doing</i>
        <i> the data search</i>

40:22.954 --> 40:24.788
   <i> and the information hunt.</i>

40:24.890 --> 40:27.190
     Are we closer to maybe
 figuring out what happened here

40:27.292 --> 40:28.558
     because of our efforts
           this year?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.527
         Yes, very much.

40:30.629 --> 40:33.897
     RICK: All we need to do
       is find one thing.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.398
             CRAIG:
              Yeah.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.033
             MARTY:
         Come on, baby!

40:40.705 --> 40:43.072
     NARRATOR: <i> After a week</i>
     <i> that saw the discovery</i>

40:43.175 --> 40:45.875
     <i> of new and mysterious</i>
  <i> structures at Smith's Cove,</i>

40:45.977 --> 40:50.380
 <i> the Laginas and their partners</i>

40:50.482 --> 40:54.350
  <i> that a 223-year-old mystery</i>

40:54.453 --> 40:58.521

40:58.623 --> 41:00.790
      <i> what will they find?</i>

41:00.892 --> 41:04.694
   <i> A fortune in pirate gold?</i>

41:04.796 --> 41:06.496
   <i> Priceless religious relics</i>

41:06.598 --> 41:08.731
          <i> hidden away</i>
    <i> by the Knights Templar?</i>

41:08.834 --> 41:11.401
    <i> Or could it be evidence</i>

41:11.503 --> 41:13.369
<i>of a vast underground structure</i>

41:13.472 --> 41:16.306
   <i> built by ancient Vikings?</i>

41:16.408 --> 41:19.042
     <i> One thing is certain.</i>

41:19.144 --> 41:20.844
 <i> Rick, Marty and their partners</i>

41:20.946 --> 41:22.946

 <i> on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:31.189 --> 41:32.856
              GARY:
     Ooh! Look at that tip!

41:32.958 --> 41:35.358
  -This is almost weapon-like.
           -RICK: Wow!

41:35.460 --> 41:36.826
    -DANNY SMITH: Going down!
 -MARTY: <i> We have to have a look</i>

41:36.928 --> 41:38.595
     <i> at H-8, so we're going</i>
       <i> to run sonar down.</i>

41:38.697 --> 41:40.230
          See that now?
        That is a clear,

41:40.332 --> 41:42.365
          -right angle.
     -MARTY: Is it possible

41:42.467 --> 41:43.967
     that you're at the side
    of a rather large cavity?

41:44.069 --> 41:45.435
              Yeah.

41:45.537 --> 41:47.504
          It's a coin!
 It's no design I've ever seen.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.475
              RICK:
   It could be incredibly old.

41:52.577 --> 41:55.879
     -LAIRD: It's concrete.
    -The Romans had concrete.
