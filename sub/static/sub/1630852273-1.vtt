WEBVTT

00:29.071 --> 00:30.322
Look. It's snow.

00:30.405 --> 00:31.406
Yes.

00:37.829 --> 00:38.830
Here I come!

00:53.387 --> 00:54.388
Heads up!

00:57.975 --> 00:59.726
- We give up! We give up!
- Yeah!

01:26.628 --> 01:27.838
Linus, watch out.

01:27.921 --> 01:28.964
What? What is it?

01:29.047 --> 01:32.759
- I just fluffed that pillow.
- What's gotten into you?

01:32.843 --> 01:35.512
- The holiday spirit.
- Already?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.514
It's the first weekend of December,

01:37.598 --> 01:41.560
and that means Christmas and Grandma
will be here soon.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.354
Well, I'm excited about
the Christmas part.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.647
Linus.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.232
I like seeing Grandma too,

01:47.316 --> 01:50.110
but she's always trying to
get me to give up my blanket.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.029
Enjoy that blanket while you can,

01:52.112 --> 01:54.948
because you know what happens
when Grandma gets here.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.284
Not if she can't find it.

02:05.501 --> 02:09.253
- What are you watching, big brother?
- <i>Citizen Kane</i>. It's a famous old movie.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.465
Why are you watching that?
It looks boring.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.926
If you must know, it's almost Christmas

02:14.009 --> 02:16.553
and that means New Year's
is right around the corner.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.766
And I haven't completed any of
my New Year's resolutions from last year.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.685
One of them was
"view a great work of art."

02:23.769 --> 02:25.562
So I'm watching this.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.731
"Rosebud"? What's "rosebud"?

02:27.814 --> 02:30.234
I don't know, Sally. I'll tell you later.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.154
Aren't you going to get that?

02:37.533 --> 02:39.201
Andy, Olaf.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.911
You're the first ones to arrive.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.122
Snoopy's very excited to
have you all here for the holidays.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.209
He's waiting for you in the back… yard.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.385
Make yourselves at home.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.141
- It's for you.
- How do you know it's not for you?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.393
I'm indisposed.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.772
Marbles. Long time no see.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.573
Belle. Happy holidays.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.283
Snoopy! It's your sister!

03:33.672 --> 03:36.967
Spike. You're looking… good.

03:40.095 --> 03:41.638
You're the last one to arrive.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.850
I'll bet you're excited
for your family reunion to begin.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.981
They're all in the back.

03:55.110 --> 03:56.820
"Rosebud" was the sled.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.826
So much for that resolution.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.134
Five cents, please.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.431
It's been a good year.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.059
What seems to be the problem,
Charlie Brown?

04:27.142 --> 04:30.812
Last year I made this list
of New Year's resolutions,

04:30.896 --> 04:33.815
and I haven't accomplished a single one.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.192
I feel like a failure.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.487
It's more than a feeling, Charlie Brown.
Let me see that.

04:38.987 --> 04:43.450
Here's your problem. These resolutions
are completely unrealistic.

04:43.534 --> 04:46.870
You need to adjust your expectations
to match your abilities.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.331
- What do you mean?
- Resolution number three,

04:49.414 --> 04:52.084
"build the world's tallest snowman."

04:53.377 --> 04:55.587
How about just "build a snowman"?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.423
Or number nine, "paint a masterpiece."

04:59.049 --> 05:02.261
Maybe just settle for
"do something remotely creative."
Maybe just settle for
"do something remotely creative."

05:02.845 --> 05:04.763
That doesn't seem very ambitious.

05:04.847 --> 05:08.725
Exactly. All you need to do
is complete one realistic resolution

05:08.809 --> 05:10.519
and you're covered for the year.

05:11.687 --> 05:17.526
One realistic resolution? Why not?
Anyone can do that, even me.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.946
Sensible mediocrity. That's the spirit.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.907
Now, what type of gingerbread house
will Grandma like?

05:23.991 --> 05:27.286
Traditional or something postmodern?

06:52.454 --> 06:55.040
<i>Grandma's coming to my house</i>

06:55.123 --> 06:57.626
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

06:57.709 --> 06:59.878
<i>Grandma's coming to my house</i>

06:59.962 --> 07:02.756
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:05.175
<i>Party gifts and hugs for me</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.928
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>

07:08.011 --> 07:12.808
<i>Cookie here, a cookie there
Cookies all the way</i>

07:12.891 --> 07:17.771
<i>Oh, what fun it is to laugh
When Grandma comes to stay, hey</i>

07:17.855 --> 07:20.732
<i>Oh, Grandma</i>

07:20.816 --> 07:26.113
<i>Brings comfort and joy</i>

07:26.947 --> 07:29.700
Linus, what are you doing?
I just made this room perfect.

07:29.783 --> 07:34.037
A boy's gotta do what he's gotta do to
hide his blanket before Grandma visits.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.958
Well, that's the first place she'll look.
No one outsmarts Grandma.

07:40.085 --> 07:43.547
Hello, van Pelt's residence.
Happy Christmas Eve.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.633
Grandma! I can't wait to see you today.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.760
The decorations are up
and everything is ready.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.557
What? What do you mean
you're not coming?

07:54.558 --> 08:00.022
But we were going to bake cookies
and play games and go caroling.
But we were going to bake cookies
and play games and go caroling.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.192
But I've been planning all month.

08:03.775 --> 08:05.652
I thought we were going to--

08:05.736 --> 08:10.574
Oh, no. It's fine. I'm-- I'm fine.

08:11.867 --> 08:16.079
Merry-- Merry Christmas, Grandma.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.272
Lucy! Wake up! It's Christmas!

08:42.356 --> 08:43.565
For you.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.275
Happy holidays!

08:47.194 --> 08:50.864
<i>Six geese a laying
Five golden rings</i>

08:52.991 --> 08:55.202
<i>Maybe Grandma didn't want to come.</i>

08:55.744 --> 08:57.746
<i>Didn't she wanna see me?</i>

08:57.829 --> 09:00.249
<i>Was it because of me?</i>
<i>Was it because of me?</i>

09:01.583 --> 09:04.670
<i>She does love me, doesn't she?</i>

09:11.844 --> 09:14.304
Am I not lovable?

09:16.139 --> 09:19.393
If my own grandma doesn't wanna see me…

09:21.144 --> 09:24.773
how do I know
anyone really loves me?

09:39.288 --> 09:43.292
Lucy, you gotta pull yourself together.

09:43.375 --> 09:47.212
You have friends. Lots of them. Yeah.

09:47.296 --> 09:51.508
That's right.
You are Lucy "Lovable" van Pelt.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.012
And I know just how to prove it.

09:57.347 --> 10:02.102
Linus. Wake up. Christmas was a letdown,
but New Year's is going to be perfect.
Linus. Wake up. Christmas was a letdown,
but New Year's is going to be perfect.

10:02.186 --> 10:04.479
I'm going to throw a party!

10:05.189 --> 10:07.566
Linus! Did you hear me?

10:08.442 --> 10:11.028
Throw a party. Sounds like fun.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.654
And you're going to help.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.865
Do you promise?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.868
- I promise. Just let me sleep.
- Deal.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.621
It's not going to be just
any old New Year's Eve party.

10:20.704 --> 10:23.123
It's going to be an elegant affair.

10:23.207 --> 10:29.129
I'm calling it "Lucy's Gala: A New Year's
Eve Celebration of Elegant Perfection."

10:29.880 --> 10:30.881
That's a mouthful.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.966
I know. Impressive, isn't it?

10:33.050 --> 10:35.969
And everyone's going to be there
to celebrate me.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.722
I mean with me. You know why?

10:39.932 --> 10:43.727
Because I am lovable!
There's so much we need to do.

10:44.811 --> 10:48.357
Rise and shine!
That's enough sleep for one day.

10:48.899 --> 10:51.360
What did I just get myself into?

10:51.944 --> 10:54.446
As you know, Linus,
to make a perfect party,

10:54.530 --> 10:57.824
everyone should dress up and be on time,
and good manners only.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.618
Are you getting all of this?

10:59.701 --> 11:02.538
"Good manners only."
"Good manners only."

11:03.330 --> 11:04.498
And at midnight,

11:04.581 --> 11:08.085
I want someone to sing that New Year's
song that people always sing.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.294
"Auld Lang Syne?"

11:09.378 --> 11:13.298
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

11:13.382 --> 11:15.926
That's the one.
Hey, why don't you sing it?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.261
Oh, okay.

11:17.344 --> 11:21.640
But not with those dusty old lyrics.
Here. I wrote some of my own.

11:21.723 --> 11:25.644
<i>One thing should never be forgot</i>

11:25.727 --> 11:29.314
<i>Lucy's party blew my mind?</i>

11:29.398 --> 11:33.402
- Really?
- Of course. I'm a lot of fun to be around.

11:33.485 --> 11:37.197
I made some calls this morning
and rented a ballroom. Isn't this great?

11:37.281 --> 11:39.741
I'm not even thinking
about Grandma anymore.

11:39.825 --> 11:41.660
You rented a ballroom?

13:11.375 --> 13:14.545
You wanna throw your party
in this crummy old building?

13:14.628 --> 13:19.132
Well, it's a little rough on the outside,
but inside…

13:19.758 --> 13:22.094
she's a real charmer.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.646
How did you pay for a ballroom?

13:32.729 --> 13:36.650
In nickels.
Charlie Brown has a lot of problems.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.944
This is perfect.

13:39.027 --> 13:42.239
The picture of elegance.
Can't you see it, Linus?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.616
Oh, I see it. I just don't believe it.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.619
Nonsense.
When we're done, it will be amazing.

13:47.703 --> 13:53.333
All it needs is a few decorations,
some music and a lot of elbow grease.

13:53.417 --> 13:57.254
I don't think I have enough elbows,
and it sure is a big space.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.465
Of course it is.
I'm inviting all of my friends.
Of course it is.
I'm inviting all of my friends.

14:00.549 --> 14:04.428
I can't wait to see their adoring faces
smiling back at me,

14:04.511 --> 14:06.722
their gracious and lovable host.

14:06.805 --> 14:11.685
Okay. I'm off to prepare the invitations
so I can deliver the good news.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.481
The things a brother will do
for his sister.

14:19.818 --> 14:24.031
Build a snowman.
That's a simple resolution. I can do that.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.542
Rats.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.559
Here's the carrot you wanted.

14:57.147 --> 15:01.443
Today is your lucky day, Charlie Brown.
I've solved your resolution problem.
Today is your lucky day, Charlie Brown.
I've solved your resolution problem.

15:01.527 --> 15:02.528
You have?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.030
I'm inviting you
to my New Year's Eve party,

15:05.113 --> 15:07.866
- and you're in charge of decorations.
- I am?

15:08.450 --> 15:10.035
Am I invited to your party?

15:10.118 --> 15:12.120
Can you stay awake until midnight?

15:12.204 --> 15:15.290
If that's a challenge, challenge accepted.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.792
You got some moxie, kid.

15:16.875 --> 15:21.630
Okay. Here's your invitation
to Lucy's Gala:

15:21.713 --> 15:25.175
A New Year's Eve Celebration
of Elegant Perfection.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.385
That's a mouthful.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.178
Do you wanna go or not?

15:29.847 --> 15:33.183
Remember, elegant. Think silver and gold.

15:33.267 --> 15:36.520
I want streamers, bows,
festive centerpieces,

15:36.603 --> 15:39.147
and a balloon drop at midnight.

15:40.399 --> 15:43.777
What does decorating
have to do with my resolutions?

15:43.861 --> 15:46.071
Your list. Number nine.

15:46.154 --> 15:50.617
Number nine, "do something
remotely creative." That's right.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.994
Count me in.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.498
And you'll be in charge of the snacks.
Can you handle that?

15:56.582 --> 15:57.708
Yes!

15:57.791 --> 15:59.626
- You can count on us.
- What do we bring?

15:59.710 --> 16:02.796
Think "elegant." Finger foods
are the perfect way to go.
Think "elegant." Finger foods
are the perfect way to go.

16:03.422 --> 16:06.884
You two are in charge
of getting everyone up and dancing.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.011
- I love to dance.
- Who doesn't?

16:09.094 --> 16:10.762
See you there.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.436
You are formally invited
to my New Year's Eve party.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.520
Yes!

16:18.604 --> 16:21.899
I was hoping you could make
an ice sculpture of the very lovable host.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.525
- Who's that?
- Me!

16:23.609 --> 16:25.986
That's it? No problem.

16:26.069 --> 16:30.490
"Lucy's Gala: A New Year's Eve
Celebration of Elegant Perfection."

16:30.574 --> 16:33.160
- That's a mouthful.
- I know!

16:35.537 --> 16:38.457
At the party,
I want you to play something significant.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.125
Do you have anything like that?

16:44.087 --> 16:47.966
No. Do you have something with
a bouncy rhythm you can dance to?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.095
That's it!

16:52.179 --> 16:56.183
I can't stand it! I just can't stand it.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.769
Musicians are far too temperamental.

17:31.760 --> 17:35.889
Hey, now that's a beat
you can dance to.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.642
What do you say to playing
my New Year's Eve party?

17:40.394 --> 17:43.105
I can pay in dog biscuits.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.655
Oh, a photo? I'd be delighted. Cheese.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.241
Enjoy.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.464
Looking good, boys.

18:11.008 --> 18:13.260
You've really outdone yourself,
Charlie Brown.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.721
Yeah. My resolution is within reach.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.181
Hey, what's that?

18:18.015 --> 18:20.184
That's the pull cord
for the balloon drop.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.393
Balloon drop?

18:21.476 --> 18:25.105
Of course.
Now let's go over the grand finale.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.859
Charlie Brown, come listen.
Your role is very important.

18:28.942 --> 18:32.696
As midnight approaches, Linus and I
will be on stage with the band.

18:32.779 --> 18:37.284
And when I yell "Happy New Year
to you too," you pull that cord.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.579
- Got it?
- "Happy New Year to you too." Got it.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.122
Happy New Year to you too.

18:42.206 --> 18:44.333
I've been thinking about
"Auld Lang Syne" too.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.293
I'm not sure if we're doing it justice.

18:46.376 --> 18:49.463
I agree. We should go back
to the original lyrics.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.300
- They have a kind message all about--
- No. I mean the song needs a beat.

18:54.635 --> 18:58.138
Now this is the kind of music
to start the New Year off right!

18:59.973 --> 19:00.974
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:01.934 --> 19:05.145
Lucy, "Auld Lang Syne"
is not a dance number.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.356
It's a traditional song with deep meaning.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.066
And it's depressing.

19:09.149 --> 19:14.947
A grand finale requires a balloon drop,
flashy costumes and catchy music.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.616
Do it for me, dear brother.

19:20.410 --> 19:21.411
Catchy it is.

19:21.495 --> 19:25.040
Perfect. Now I need to get home
so I can start getting ready.

19:25.123 --> 19:29.253
Better pick up the pace if we're going to
be ready before our guests arrive.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.880
Linus, how are you with knots?

20:48.582 --> 20:50.125
I'm gonna dance all night.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.587
You are lovable,
and this party is going to prove it.

20:54.171 --> 20:57.925
Now! The event
you've been waiting for all week!

20:58.008 --> 21:00.677
Welcome to Lucy's Gala:
Welcome to Lucy's Gala:

21:00.761 --> 21:02.387
A New Year's Eve Celebration of--

21:05.182 --> 21:07.142
Elegant Perfection.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.605
Party! Look at that! Let's go!

21:12.564 --> 21:13.941
Come on, everyone!

21:14.024 --> 21:16.485
Okay, let's get to work.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.445
Work? I thought this was a party.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.491
Enjoying yourself? Good!

21:22.991 --> 21:24.993
Having a nice time? Wonderful.

21:25.077 --> 21:28.247
- Good to see you.
- Don't you just love this party? Me too.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.415
Have fun.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.418
"Happy New Year to you too."

21:35.921 --> 21:37.923
Where is my band?

21:38.006 --> 21:39.758
Midnight, you're mine.

21:39.842 --> 21:41.176
You said it, sister.

21:43.095 --> 21:44.096
Boys!

21:44.179 --> 21:48.267
The invitation clearly stated good
manners only. That means no running.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.185
<i>Vámonos</i>.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.271
What is this?

21:52.771 --> 21:56.024
Where are the fancy little sandwiches
with the crust cut off?

21:56.108 --> 21:58.068
I specifically asked for finger food.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.195
You can eat jelly beans with your fingers.
You can eat jelly beans with your fingers.

22:00.279 --> 22:02.364
- And tapioca pudding?
- Yes?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.200
Forget it.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.618
What are those?

22:06.702 --> 22:10.414
I thought it would be nice if I brought
my world-famous mud pies for dessert.

22:10.497 --> 22:15.002
Pigpen, you can't expect anyone
to eat this disgusting slop.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.963
- They're delicious. Hey.
- Linus!

22:19.214 --> 22:20.549
I was eating that.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.343
- Here. Take these.
- Mud pies.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.637
No, take these away.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.097
We were just trying to help.

22:27.181 --> 22:29.558
We wanted to bring fun party food.

22:29.641 --> 22:31.143
This party is already fun.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.645
Look at everyone having fun.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.151
What is the meaning of this?

22:39.234 --> 22:40.819
We wanted to dance.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.571
So we brought our favorite music.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.782
No, no, no. I have a real band coming.
Thank you.

22:45.866 --> 22:49.828
Linus! Where's the band? Where's my music?

22:50.495 --> 22:51.580
I'll go find out.

22:52.164 --> 22:54.625
Mingle among yourselves.
Have fun!

22:54.708 --> 22:57.711
Schroeder, you're having fun, aren't you?

22:57.794 --> 23:00.756
Doesn't this elegant party
remind you of anyone?
Doesn't this elegant party
remind you of anyone?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.049
I guess so.

23:02.132 --> 23:05.969
I knew you'd think so. Would you say
this evening is lovable?

23:07.971 --> 23:11.183
I'm gonna go check out
those chairs over there.

23:12.059 --> 23:13.143
Nine o'clock.

23:14.311 --> 23:16.647
Gonna stay awake. Come on, Sally.

23:16.730 --> 23:20.484
It's only nine o'clock?
Being this lovable is exhausting.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.320
Make way. Coming through.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.113
My ice sculpture!

23:25.197 --> 23:28.575
Gather round! Gather round, everyone,
for the big reveal!

23:28.659 --> 23:30.244
Finally something exciting.

23:30.994 --> 23:32.120
Drumroll, please.

23:37.251 --> 23:39.878
What is so funny? Linus!

23:42.673 --> 23:45.968
Linus, find somewhere
to put that… ice thing.

23:47.261 --> 23:48.762
What? She didn't like it?

23:49.513 --> 23:51.098
Where is my band?

23:59.189 --> 24:00.899
- The band is here.
- Who's ready to dance?
- The band is here.
- Who's ready to dance?

24:00.983 --> 24:04.194
- Come dance, Charlie Brown.
- I'll be right back.

24:04.695 --> 24:07.447
- Is that a dog band?
- Why not?

24:07.531 --> 24:11.535
Good. You're finally here.
Let's get this party started.

24:24.047 --> 24:26.842
No, no, no. I didn't hire you for this.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.761
Play something peppy
that everyone can dance to.

24:36.226 --> 24:38.061
- I'm gonna sit down.
- I give up.

24:42.733 --> 24:43.734
I'm back.

24:43.817 --> 24:47.404
Nobody can dance to that.
Dog music stinks.

24:49.489 --> 24:50.949
Linus!

24:52.993 --> 24:54.286
I don't understand.

24:54.369 --> 24:58.707
This party is the perfect reflection
of me, but no one is having fun.

24:58.790 --> 25:00.834
- Why don't they love me?
- What?
- Why don't they love me?
- What?

25:00.918 --> 25:03.045
My party. Why don't they love my party?

25:03.128 --> 25:06.089
Maybe if you didn't have
so many expectations and rules--

25:06.173 --> 25:10.010
With no rules, this would be a madhouse.
No. We are not trying hard enough.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.470
- We?
- Yes.

25:11.553 --> 25:14.264
The tone of an elegant party
is set by its hosts.

25:14.348 --> 25:18.435
We can still save this night.
Time for a costume change.

25:19.269 --> 25:20.646
You're gonna put that on?

25:21.313 --> 25:24.525
Don't be silly. No, this is for you.

25:25.234 --> 25:28.278
- This is for me.
- But I--

25:28.362 --> 25:31.156
The future of my party
is depending on you.

25:31.240 --> 25:32.658
Please, Linus.

25:32.741 --> 25:34.243
If you don't wear this costume

25:34.326 --> 25:37.079
and sing that song at midnight
for our grand finale,

25:37.162 --> 25:42.709
the night will end in failure and this
whole thing will have been for nothing.

25:42.793 --> 25:45.337
You promised you'd help me, so help.

25:47.089 --> 25:49.299
I knew I could count on you.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.095
And to think,
all my problems would be solved

25:53.178 --> 25:55.597
if Grandma had just showed up
for Christmas.

25:56.974 --> 25:59.101
Hey! No double-dipping, Maynard.

25:59.184 --> 26:01.103
You're banned from the crudités.
You're banned from the crudités.

26:16.243 --> 26:18.412
No, no. I'm awake. I'm awake.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.749
Quiet down, everybody.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.585
Are you all having a good time?

26:24.668 --> 26:25.711
Not really.

26:27.004 --> 26:30.883
Well, it's 30 minutes until midnight
when we will count down to the New Year.

26:30.966 --> 26:32.384
Won't that be fun?

26:33.177 --> 26:37.055
Then Linus will lead us in singing
that "Auld Lang"-- whatever song.

26:37.139 --> 26:41.185
Come on out here and show everyone
how excited you are for the New Year.

26:41.268 --> 26:42.561
I don't want to.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.983
Linus, get out here.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.318
Oh, my goodness.

26:50.527 --> 26:52.321
Are those feathers?

26:52.404 --> 26:54.948
Go on. Say something.

27:00.495 --> 27:01.997
My Sweet Babboo.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.415
So much for elegant.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.253
Linus, get up. You're ruining everything.

27:12.883 --> 27:16.929
Lucy, I've done everything I can
to make you happy.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.806
I worked all night, all week, even.

27:19.890 --> 27:23.894
And now you're saying
I'm ruining everything. Me?

27:23.977 --> 27:25.729
This could've been a fun party,

27:25.812 --> 27:28.148
but it's you and your perfect rules

27:28.232 --> 27:32.027
that have turned a perfectly good holiday
into a perfectly terrible party.

27:32.110 --> 27:33.237
He's right.

27:34.488 --> 27:38.784
That's right. I said it.
This party is terrible!

27:38.867 --> 27:41.286
I hereby quit
your terrible party committee.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.789
You can find someone else
to take for granted.

27:43.872 --> 27:45.415
I'm done.

27:48.919 --> 27:50.754
- He said it.
- That was a bust.

27:50.838 --> 27:53.048
- Come on. Let's go.
- It's not fun at all.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.217
- Wait.
- Come on. Let's go.

27:55.300 --> 27:58.387
Go ahead. Leave! This isn't my fault.

27:58.470 --> 28:01.306
I planned a perfectly elegant party.
I planned a perfectly elegant party.

28:01.390 --> 28:05.185
- I never asked for disappointing snacks.
- Hey.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.854
Or boring music.

28:06.937 --> 28:09.940
And don't get me started
on that ice sculpture.

28:10.023 --> 28:12.067
I thought it was good.

28:12.150 --> 28:16.196
Oh, I almost forgot. Happy New Year!

28:18.115 --> 28:21.410
Well, happy New Year to you too!

28:21.910 --> 28:23.495
"Happy New Year to you too."

28:29.168 --> 28:30.294
Good grief.

28:38.385 --> 28:39.511
I'm awake. I'm awake.

28:39.595 --> 28:42.306
Wait! It's almost midnight.
Please. Please.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.725
Goodbye, resolution.

28:58.530 --> 28:59.656
You left too?

28:59.740 --> 29:03.160
Yeah. The party
kind of broke up after you left.
Yeah. The party
kind of broke up after you left.

29:03.243 --> 29:06.163
- I really hoped it would work.
- What would work?

29:06.246 --> 29:09.583
I tried to help Lucy because she thought
that if she threw a party

29:09.666 --> 29:11.668
and everyone showed up
and had a good time,

29:11.752 --> 29:14.046
it would prove somehow that she is loved.

29:14.129 --> 29:17.674
But that doesn't make any sense.
Of course she's loved.

29:17.758 --> 29:18.842
You and I know that.

29:18.926 --> 29:23.013
But our grandma didn't come for Christmas
this year, and Lucy took it pretty hard.

29:23.555 --> 29:25.349
She thought it was because of her.

29:26.350 --> 29:28.477
Well, that certainly explains a lot.

29:29.186 --> 29:30.729
Poor Lucy.

29:31.605 --> 29:35.484
"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind?"

29:36.318 --> 29:38.570
It's from the song "Auld Lang Syne."

29:39.696 --> 29:42.658
I always sing along
and pretend to know the words.

29:42.741 --> 29:43.992
Most people do.

29:44.076 --> 29:46.245
As one year turns into the next,

29:46.328 --> 29:48.705
"Auld Lang Syne" is a heartfelt reminder

29:48.789 --> 29:52.459
that we should never forget our friends
or the good times we've shared.

29:52.543 --> 29:55.838
And hopefully,
they will do the same for us.

29:58.215 --> 30:00.342
That's a really nice idea.
That's a really nice idea.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.887
Yeah. Lucy sure could've
used a reminder like that.

31:01.695 --> 31:05.532
…eight, seven, six,

31:05.616 --> 31:10.579
five, four, three, two, one.

31:10.662 --> 31:12.289
Happy New Year!

31:14.833 --> 31:19.421
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

31:19.505 --> 31:23.926
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

31:24.009 --> 31:26.845
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

31:26.929 --> 31:33.852
- "Should auld acquaintance be forgot?"
- <i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>

31:33.936 --> 31:37.523
<i>For auld lang…</i>

31:45.239 --> 31:47.491
One happy New Year to me.

31:56.375 --> 31:57.376
Lucy?

31:57.459 --> 31:59.253
I'm sorry about your party.

32:00.504 --> 32:03.382
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.133
I ruined everything.

32:05.843 --> 32:09.721
I should've been more appreciative
of everything you did. Sorry.

32:10.597 --> 32:11.807
Here's your blanket.

32:12.641 --> 32:15.561
I should've known my party
was going to be a bust.

32:16.186 --> 32:18.981
I'm just… unlovable.

32:19.648 --> 32:20.649
That's not true.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.110
I love you.

32:23.986 --> 32:26.780
You're my brother. You have to love me.

32:26.864 --> 32:30.158
Actually, that's not true either.
But I do.

32:30.242 --> 32:32.119
And so do a lot of other people.

32:32.995 --> 32:34.246
Like who?

32:36.915 --> 32:38.125
Like me, Lucy.

32:42.754 --> 32:44.756
Good old Charlie Brown.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.217
Linus told me about your grandma

32:47.301 --> 32:49.344
and what that party meant to you.

32:49.428 --> 32:53.265
I know what it's like when things
don't work out the way you'd hoped.

32:53.348 --> 32:55.475
Can I ask you a question?

32:56.185 --> 33:00.898
You fail over and over
and over and over and--
You fail over and over
and over and over and--

33:00.981 --> 33:02.149
What's the question?

33:02.232 --> 33:06.069
Right.
Well, how do you do it, Charlie Brown?

33:06.153 --> 33:10.240
How do you manage to keep going
when life gets you down?

33:10.324 --> 33:15.996
I remember that no matter how bad things
may seem, I can always rely on my friends.

33:18.248 --> 33:22.503
Thanks, you two. But I'm not sure
how many friends I have after tonight.

33:24.796 --> 33:25.839
Good night.

33:25.923 --> 33:26.924
Lucy.

33:35.891 --> 33:38.393
- Heya, Lucy.
- Good to see you.

33:38.477 --> 33:39.728
Hey, old friend!

33:42.648 --> 33:43.941
Wha-- What's going on?

33:44.024 --> 33:47.069
Charlie Brown let us know
you were going through a hard time.

33:47.152 --> 33:48.153
He did?

33:48.237 --> 33:49.446
It's okay, Lucy.

33:49.530 --> 33:51.365
Yeah. We all wanted to be here.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.742
To remind you that you're not alone.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.620
- But why would you--
- It's what friends do, Lucille.

33:56.703 --> 33:58.914
- We're here for you.
- We love you, Lucy.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.457
You do?
You do?

34:00.541 --> 34:02.960
I'm… lovable?

34:03.043 --> 34:05.963
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on. Don't be silly.

34:07.214 --> 34:11.802
But midnight. The countdown.
The singing. You all missed it.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.388
Because of me.

34:14.471 --> 34:15.681
I'm so sorry.

34:16.514 --> 34:18.308
Can you ever forgive me?

34:18.391 --> 34:21.645
In case you hadn't noticed,
we already have.

34:22.980 --> 34:26.190
Lucy, it's never too late
to make things right.

34:26.275 --> 34:27.275
Ten.

34:27.359 --> 34:29.277
Nine, eight,

34:29.360 --> 34:32.322
seven, six, five,

34:32.406 --> 34:36.284
four, three, two, one.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.871
Happy New Year!

34:43.833 --> 34:48.422
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

34:48.505 --> 34:52.759
<i>And never brought to mind?</i>

34:52.842 --> 34:57.431
- <i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>
- Who? Me?

34:57.514 --> 35:01.810
<i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>
<i>And days of auld lang syne?</i>

35:01.894 --> 35:06.231
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

35:06.315 --> 35:10.277
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

35:10.360 --> 35:14.990
- Hey, Snoopy.
- <i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

35:15.073 --> 35:19.328
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

35:19.411 --> 35:23.123
<i>Should auld acquaintance be forgot</i>

35:23.207 --> 35:25.709
You know what, Linus? I was wrong.

35:25.792 --> 35:30.631
This song is wonderful, and it will always
remind me of all my friends.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.549
I thought you might see it that way.

35:33.967 --> 35:37.179
<i>For days of auld lang syne</i>

35:37.262 --> 35:42.017
<i>For auld lang syne, my dear</i>

35:42.100 --> 35:45.062
Now this is a perfect party.

35:45.646 --> 35:48.732
Here. Write this down. "Be a good friend."

35:48.815 --> 35:50.442
"Good friend."

35:50.526 --> 35:52.069
- Now cross it off.
- But--

35:52.152 --> 35:54.780
Go on. Cross it off. Good.

35:54.863 --> 35:57.616
You may not have completed
any resolutions last year,

35:57.699 --> 36:00.244
but you're already covered for this year.
but you're already covered for this year.

36:00.327 --> 36:01.995
Happy New Year, Lucy.

36:02.079 --> 36:04.039
Happy New Year, Charlie Brown.

36:04.122 --> 36:09.419
<i>We'll take a cup of kindness yet</i>

36:09.503 --> 36:15.425
<i>For auld lang syne</i>

36:25.227 --> 36:26.687
You should've seen it, Grandma.

36:26.770 --> 36:30.899
We had food, decorations,
music and dancing.

36:30.983 --> 36:34.027
And the best part,
all my friends were there.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.072
Yes, Linus was there too.

36:37.155 --> 36:39.533
He even led us in singing
"Auld Lang Syne."

36:41.076 --> 36:43.537
No, he did not give up his blanket,

36:43.620 --> 36:46.331
but we can work on that
when you visit for my birthday.

36:50.878 --> 36:52.838
I love you too, Grandma.
