01:01.271 --> 01:05.108
and it happened
in the 1932 World Series.

01:05.191 --> 01:08.653
The story goes that in the bottom
of the ninth inning with two outs,

01:08.778 --> 01:11.448
a full count
and the tying run on base,

01:11.531 --> 01:14.784
Babe Ruth raised his arm and pointed
to the center field bleachers.

01:14.868 --> 01:19.372
No one believed it,
because nobody had ever done it before.

01:19.497 --> 01:22.208
But The Babe
was calling his shot.

01:22.334 --> 01:28.173
On the next pitch, the Great Bambino
hit a towering 400-foot home run.

01:28.298 --> 01:31.217
And even although he'd been
a hero before that,

01:31.343 --> 01:34.429
that's pretty much
how he became a legend.

01:34.512 --> 01:38.683
Thirty years later, a kid named
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez...

01:38.808 --> 01:40.810
became a neighborhood legend.

01:40.935 --> 01:43.104
It was in the greatest summer
of my life...

01:43.188 --> 01:45.106
when he taught me
to play baseball,

01:45.190 --> 01:47.400
and he became my best friend.

01:47.525 --> 01:51.196
And he got me out of the biggest
pickle I'd ever be in.

02:21.059 --> 02:23.687
Go! Go! Go!

03:02.475 --> 03:05.562
Come over at 9:00.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.564
All right.
See you later.

03:13.737 --> 03:17.115
I moved to the neighborhood
two weeks before school let out.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.491
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

03:18.491 --> 03:21.995
It was the same summer
that Dodger Maury Wills would
break the stolen bases record.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.205
So with something
that incredible going on,

03:24.289 --> 03:28.418
it should've started off with loads
of great things happening for me,

03:28.501 --> 03:30.545
but it didn't.

03:30.629 --> 03:35.008
I was from another state,
and I didn't have a single
friend in a thousand miles.

03:36.301 --> 03:38.720
It was a lousy way
to end up the fifth grade,

03:38.803 --> 03:41.931
'cause I had zip time
to make friends before summer.

03:42.015 --> 03:45.935
And that's about
where it all started.

03:50.148 --> 03:53.401
My real dad died
when I was just a little kid.

03:53.485 --> 03:57.947
My mom had married Bill about a year
before we moved to the Valley.

03:58.031 --> 04:02.994
At the time, he and I were still
getting used to each other.

04:03.119 --> 04:05.789
Yeah.

04:07.624 --> 04:10.752
- Um, Dad?
- Mm-hm m?

04:10.835 --> 04:12.754
I -I mean Bill.

04:12.837 --> 04:17.759
- Remember you-- you promised
you'd teach me to play catch?
- Mm-hmm.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.053
Um,

04:20.178 --> 04:22.096
w-well,
could you teach me?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.809
Yeah. Sure.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.900
Okay.

04:34.025 --> 04:36.236
- Okay?
- Thanks.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.910
Sorry.

05:25.785 --> 05:29.080
I'd followed them
to the sandlot once after school.

05:29.164 --> 05:31.708
I'd never seen any place like it.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.836
It was like their own little
baseball kingdom or something.

05:34.919 --> 05:37.797
It was the greatest place
I'd ever seen anyway.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.883
- Bertram.
- But they were good,

05:39.966 --> 05:41.885
- real good.
- Come on, Bertram!

05:41.968 --> 05:44.804
And all I had was a plastic toy mitt
that my grandmother gave me...

05:44.929 --> 05:47.307
for my birthday when I was six.

05:47.432 --> 05:51.645
But when I finally got up enough guts to
go out there and try and make friends,

05:51.770 --> 05:55.357
I found out that they never kept score,
they never chose sides,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.734
they never even really
stopped playing the game.

05:57.817 --> 06:02.322
It just went on forever.
Every day they picked up where
they left off the day before.

06:02.447 --> 06:05.450
- It was like an endless dream game.
- Come on! Come on!

06:05.575 --> 06:08.578
There was only eight of them,
so they didn't have a whole team.

06:08.662 --> 06:12.582
So even though I didn't know
how to play, I figured
I could be the ninth man...

06:12.666 --> 06:15.835
and maybe just stand in the outfield
somewhere and take up space.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.714
- Squints!
- Of course, if I'd have known what was
gonna happen when I got there,

06:19.798 --> 06:24.302
- I got it!
- I probably never would've gone.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.096
- Nice catch.
- Yeah.

06:32.268 --> 06:36.398
Come on!

06:54.833 --> 06:57.836
Come on, Benny,
hit a homer!

06:57.919 --> 06:59.838
- Come on!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

06:59.963 --> 07:02.173
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

07:22.861 --> 07:25.447
Okay, I'll get it!
Get it.

07:25.530 --> 07:29.826
Don't be a goofus. Don't be a goofus!
Don't be a goofus!

07:38.376 --> 07:42.672
- Throw the ball back! Come on!
- Yeah, hurry up!

07:53.516 --> 07:55.685
We are waiting!

07:55.769 --> 07:57.729
Come on! Throw it!

08:02.942 --> 08:06.655
- Come on, toss me the ball!
- Come on!

08:06.738 --> 08:08.698
Come on!

08:14.287 --> 08:18.792
Oh, my God!

08:20.543 --> 08:22.545
My life's over.

08:22.629 --> 08:25.131
Did you see that hand?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.679
If it wasn't for Benny,

08:30.762 --> 08:33.431
I never would've made
a single friend that summer,

08:33.556 --> 08:36.101
'cause all the rest of those
guys thought I was a lost cause.

08:37.477 --> 08:40.020
Even before we became friends,

08:40.105 --> 08:44.567
Benny and me were connected, connected
for the one moment later that summer...

08:44.651 --> 08:46.695
when I'd get us all
into the biggest pickle...

08:46.778 --> 08:49.572
any of us had ever seen.

08:57.247 --> 08:59.791
Night, hon.

08:59.916 --> 09:03.420
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.
It was an accident.

09:12.762 --> 09:16.016
Scotty, have you made
any friends yet?

09:17.642 --> 09:20.061
- No.
- Why not, honey?

09:22.147 --> 09:24.149
'Cause I'm still new.

09:24.274 --> 09:28.528
I don't want you sitting around in here
all summer fiddling with this stuff...

09:28.653 --> 09:30.655
like you did last summer
and the one before.

09:30.780 --> 09:33.283
I know you're smart,
and I'm proud of you.

09:33.366 --> 09:37.912
I want you to get out into the fresh air
and make some friends.

09:37.996 --> 09:41.458
Run around,
scrape your knees, get dirty.

09:41.541 --> 09:43.460
Climb trees, hop fences.

09:43.543 --> 09:46.796
Get into trouble,
for crying out loud.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.883
Not too much, but some.
You have my permission.

09:50.008 --> 09:53.470
How many mothers do you know who
say something like that to their sons?

09:53.553 --> 09:56.264
Well, none mothers, I guess.

09:56.348 --> 10:01.019
Honey, I want you to make
some friends this summer. Lots of them.

10:02.145 --> 10:04.105
Yeah, I know.

10:04.189 --> 10:06.107
But I'm not good
at anything, Mom.

10:06.191 --> 10:08.109
Face it,
I'm just an egghead.

10:08.193 --> 10:12.656
Honey, you'll always be just an egghead
with an attitude like that.

10:29.172 --> 10:31.383
Well?

10:33.093 --> 10:35.428
Well?

10:35.553 --> 10:39.224
- He's too busy, Mom.
- Oh, no, honey, he's not.
He has some time.

10:39.349 --> 10:42.435
You go on back out there
and ask him.

10:44.562 --> 10:46.648
- Uh, Bill, uh--
- Yeah?

10:46.731 --> 10:49.943
I mean, Dad, uh, can we--

10:50.068 --> 10:54.406
I mean, could you, like you said,
teach me to play catch?

10:54.531 --> 10:56.866
Yeah. Sure.

10:56.950 --> 10:58.868
But I gotta get
this done, okay?

10:58.952 --> 11:01.454
- Okay, thanks.
- All right.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.415
- Bill?
- Yeah?

11:03.540 --> 11:07.127
Uh, couldn't you take a break
and teach him now?

11:07.252 --> 11:09.587
- Mom, it's okay, really.
- Honey,

11:09.713 --> 11:12.132
I said I would, and I will,
but I'm under the gun here.

11:12.257 --> 11:14.467
How long could it take?

11:14.592 --> 11:16.970
Can't you spare half an hour
and show him now?

11:17.095 --> 11:19.597
- Mom, really, it's okay.
- All right.

11:21.349 --> 11:24.019
Okay. I'll get my glove.

11:27.272 --> 11:30.859
See? I told you.

11:30.942 --> 11:33.153
Oh, great.

11:33.278 --> 11:35.697
All right, Scotty, get down
to that end of the yard.

11:35.780 --> 11:37.365
Okay.

11:37.449 --> 11:40.118
Now, the key to this game
is keeping your eye on the ball.

11:40.243 --> 11:43.788
No matter whether you're in the field
or at bat, eye on the ball, okay?

11:43.913 --> 11:45.957
All right. Uh, yeah.
I think so.

11:46.082 --> 11:48.543
Where the ball goes,
your glove should go. Got it?

11:48.626 --> 11:50.462
Okay.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.422
Okay. All right.

11:56.384 --> 11:58.845
Darn. Sorry.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.764
It's all right.
All right.

12:09.064 --> 12:11.608
Um-- Uh, here.

12:14.194 --> 12:16.112
Okay.

12:16.196 --> 12:18.281
Okay, I'm ready.

12:18.365 --> 12:22.118
Eye on the ball, okay?
Got it?

12:22.202 --> 12:23.453
Okay.

12:23.536 --> 12:26.289
If the ball moves,
move your glove. Got it?

12:26.373 --> 12:27.791
Yeah.

12:27.874 --> 12:30.293
All right. Here we go.

12:35.632 --> 12:38.385
Okay. You just need a bigger glove.
Throw it back to me this time.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.014
Throw it back.

12:58.446 --> 13:01.533
Okay. Scotty,
keep your eye on the ball.

13:01.658 --> 13:03.994
Okay. Got it.

13:04.077 --> 13:05.328
Okay.

13:06.830 --> 13:09.207
Ow! Oh, my eye!

13:09.332 --> 13:12.460
Ow! Ow! Oh!

13:12.544 --> 13:14.462
Ow! Ow!

13:14.546 --> 13:17.757
- What happened?
- My eye.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.844
- Honey, get some ice. Ice.
- No, I got it.

13:20.969 --> 13:22.887
- Here you go.
- Those were for dinner.

13:22.971 --> 13:24.889
- Oh!
- Just hold it up there.

13:24.973 --> 13:26.891
Nice and hard.
Press it against-- Yeah.

13:26.975 --> 13:29.811
- I just took my eye off the ball, Mom.
- Yeah, but you caught it.

13:29.894 --> 13:32.605
Just keep that on for, like, an hour.

13:32.731 --> 13:35.608
It'll still be black,
but it won't swell.

13:35.734 --> 13:38.194
Sorry.

13:38.320 --> 13:40.572
Gotta watch out
for that curve.

13:47.537 --> 13:49.414
Hey.

13:52.292 --> 13:55.420
I'm gonna play some ball.
We need an extra guy. You wanna go?

13:55.545 --> 13:59.007
- No. Thanks.
- Why not? Don't you like baseball?

13:59.090 --> 14:01.509
- Oh, yeah, but--
- But what?

14:03.970 --> 14:06.723
But my glove--
it's busted.

14:06.806 --> 14:11.186
Uh, see? Now I can't go.
Thanks, though.

14:11.269 --> 14:13.104
It's okay.

14:14.272 --> 14:16.149
I got an extra one.

14:18.318 --> 14:20.278
Come on. Let's go.

14:23.114 --> 14:25.492
Mom, I'm gonna go
play some ball!

14:25.617 --> 14:27.494
I'll be back
in a little while.

14:27.619 --> 14:29.496
Come on. Let's go.

14:32.457 --> 14:35.377
And I'm Babe Ruth.

14:42.884 --> 14:45.470
Listen. Ready?

14:45.595 --> 14:48.139
Check this out.

14:48.264 --> 14:50.558
I'm the Great Bambino.

14:50.642 --> 14:52.769
What?

14:52.894 --> 14:55.897
- I'm the Great Bambino.
- What?

14:55.981 --> 14:58.191
I'm the Great Bambino.

14:58.316 --> 15:00.276
Oh!

15:00.360 --> 15:02.195
Who's that?

15:06.199 --> 15:08.118
What?

15:08.201 --> 15:11.121
I had no idea
who they were talking about.

15:11.204 --> 15:14.833
- What did he say?
- What, were you born in a barn, man?

15:14.958 --> 15:16.835
Yeah, what planet
are you from?

15:16.960 --> 15:19.254
But there was
no way I could let them know.

15:19.337 --> 15:21.548
You never heard
of the Sultan of Swat?

15:21.673 --> 15:23.591
The Titan of Terror?

15:23.675 --> 15:26.803
- The Colossus of Clout?
- The Colossus of Clout!

15:26.886 --> 15:30.515
- The King of Crash, man.
- So I lied.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.019
Oh, yeah, the Great Bambino.
Of course.

15:34.144 --> 15:36.021
I thought you said,
"the Great Bambi."

15:36.146 --> 15:38.273
That wimpy deer?

15:38.356 --> 15:41.735
Yeah. I guess. Sorry.

15:44.487 --> 15:49.868
Anyway, Scott, that's
Timmy and Tommy Timmons,

15:49.993 --> 15:52.454
Mike "Squints" Palledorous,

15:52.537 --> 15:55.040
Alan McClellan--
we call him Yeah-Yeah--

15:55.123 --> 15:57.709
Bertram Grover Weeks,

15:57.834 --> 16:00.295
Kenny DeNunez
and Hamilton Porter.

16:00.378 --> 16:02.839
We call him Ham.
Guys, this is Scott Smalls.

16:02.922 --> 16:04.841
Hi.

16:06.718 --> 16:10.555
Yeah, um, wel I, he's gonna play with us
'cause he makes nine.

16:10.639 --> 16:13.933
Now we've got a whole team. We're
wasting time. Let's go to the sandlot.

16:14.059 --> 16:16.853
- Benny, it's 9:00 in the morning.
- It's 9:00.

16:16.936 --> 16:18.229
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

16:18.229 --> 16:20.231
- Why'd you bring him, Benny?
- 'Cause there's eight of us,
and he makes nine.

16:20.357 --> 16:22.901
Yeah, yeah, so would my sister,
but I didn't bring her.

16:23.026 --> 16:25.654
With nine guys we've got
a whole team, Yeah-Yeah.

16:26.780 --> 16:30.575
No. With Elswenger
we had a whole team.

16:30.659 --> 16:34.120
- Elswenger could catch.
- And throw.

16:34.245 --> 16:36.873
Come on, Benny, man.
He ain't game.

16:36.998 --> 16:40.043
- You saw the way he threw.
- Yeah.

16:40.126 --> 16:44.339
You already fill up all
the empty positions since
Elswenger moved to Arizona.

16:44.422 --> 16:47.425
Right. And now I get to rotate
eight positions instead of seven.

16:47.509 --> 16:51.638
- I need the practice, guys.
- You're the best on the team.
You don't need any practice.

16:51.763 --> 16:54.140
- No, you don't.
- You're the best, man.

16:54.265 --> 16:56.643
Come on, Benny, man.
The kid is...

16:56.768 --> 17:00.438
a L-7 weenie.

17:00.563 --> 17:04.108
Yeah, yeah.
Oscar Mayer even. Foot-long!

17:04.233 --> 17:07.904
Dodger dog! A weenie!

17:09.823 --> 17:12.409
What are you laughing at, Yeah-Yeah?
You run like a duck.

17:13.617 --> 17:15.829
Okay, okay, but I'm-- I'm--

17:15.954 --> 17:19.290
- Part of the game, right?
- Mmm, yeah.

17:19.415 --> 17:21.710
Now, how come
he don't get to be?

17:21.792 --> 17:23.877
- 'Cause he's a geek, man.
- He can't catch.

17:23.962 --> 17:27.007
Man, base up,
you blockheads.

17:32.512 --> 17:35.682
Smalls, you take
left center, okay?

17:35.807 --> 17:38.768
Okay. Um, where
exactly is that?

17:40.854 --> 17:42.772
It's over there, man.

17:49.279 --> 17:51.156
Here?

17:53.366 --> 17:55.285
That's left.
I said left center.

17:56.494 --> 17:58.788
Okay. Right.

17:58.872 --> 18:00.790
Here?

18:03.668 --> 18:06.171
Come on, Benny, man.

18:06.296 --> 18:09.883
He's never gonna catch the ball anyway.
Let's just play.

18:11.801 --> 18:15.597
- What a jerk.
- Yeah-Yeah, get two.

18:18.850 --> 18:20.894
Come on!
Throw it in here, Bertram!

18:23.355 --> 18:25.899
- Nice.
- Wow!

18:26.024 --> 18:27.901
Good job!

18:30.362 --> 18:33.156
- Hey, Smalls, throw it to second.
- Okay.

18:36.826 --> 18:40.914
- Come on, Benny.
He's never gonna catch it.
- He's not gonna catch it.

18:43.375 --> 18:46.294
Oh! I told you, Benny.
We told you.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.676
Come on, Benny.
Why'd you do that?

18:56.388 --> 19:00.016
A square, Benny.
The kid's a square.

19:06.272 --> 19:09.025
Come on. Throw it in.

19:09.109 --> 19:11.945
What the hell's he doing?

19:15.740 --> 19:17.701
I don't believe this.

19:21.121 --> 19:24.040
Here. Sorry. Sorry.

19:50.734 --> 19:52.610
You can throw it, you know.

19:55.113 --> 19:57.032
No.

19:57.115 --> 19:59.159
I can't.

19:59.284 --> 20:01.161
I don't know how.

20:03.121 --> 20:07.250
Thanks for taking me here,
but I think I'd better go.

20:07.375 --> 20:10.378
Hey, hey.
You think too much.

20:10.462 --> 20:12.380
I bet you get straight A's
and shit, huh?

20:12.464 --> 20:14.799
No, I got a "B" once.

20:14.924 --> 20:18.261
Actually an A-minus.
But it should've been a "B."

20:18.345 --> 20:21.014
Man, this is baseball.
You gotta stop thinking.

20:21.139 --> 20:23.016
You just have fun.

20:23.141 --> 20:26.019
I mean, if you were having fun,
you would've caught that ball.

20:29.272 --> 20:31.149
You ever have
a paper route?

20:31.274 --> 20:33.360
I helped a guy once.

20:34.986 --> 20:37.822
Okay. Well, chuck it like
you would throw a paper.

20:37.947 --> 20:41.242
When your arm gets here,
just let go.

20:41.326 --> 20:43.244
Just let go.
It's that easy.

20:44.496 --> 20:47.165
How do I catch it?

20:49.125 --> 20:52.796
Just stand there and stick your glove
out in the air.

20:52.879 --> 20:54.798
I'll take care of it.

20:54.881 --> 20:58.051
About time, Benny.
My clothes are going out of style.

20:58.176 --> 21:00.845
- They already are, Squints.
- Shut up!

21:01.888 --> 21:03.807
I told you, Benny.

21:06.476 --> 21:08.395
Smalls, throw it to second.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.897
Okay.

21:12.983 --> 21:15.318
Not again.

21:15.402 --> 21:17.529
We're wasting time, Benny.

21:19.197 --> 21:21.116
Please catch it.

21:29.499 --> 21:31.543
Please catch it.

21:31.668 --> 21:34.296
Please catch it.
Please catch it.

21:41.386 --> 21:43.305
Yeah!

21:45.265 --> 21:49.352
- All right!
- He's all right.

21:49.436 --> 21:52.063
I told you so, man.

21:56.401 --> 21:58.320
Okay.

21:58.403 --> 22:01.448
- Let's play some ball.
- Yeah, let's play some ball.

22:01.573 --> 22:05.035
All right.
I knew it... all the time.

22:08.747 --> 22:10.498
Yeah!

22:25.972 --> 22:28.058
I'll show you some more
tomorrow, okay?

22:28.141 --> 22:30.060
- Okay. Bye.
- You did good.

22:30.143 --> 22:32.062
See you later, Ham.
8:00 tomorrow.

22:32.145 --> 22:34.064
- 8:00, Benny?
- Yeah. See you later, Smalls.

22:34.147 --> 22:36.524
Bye. See you tomorrow.

22:36.608 --> 22:38.526
Benny, wait!

22:38.610 --> 22:42.322
- Your glove.
- Keep it, man.

22:42.447 --> 22:44.324
Thanks!

22:45.950 --> 22:48.244
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Smalls.

22:52.957 --> 22:57.253
Um, bring a T-shirt
and jeans tomorrow, okay?

22:57.337 --> 23:01.132
- Oh, um, you got a fireplace?
- Oh, yeah.

23:01.257 --> 23:03.176
Yeah, why?

23:03.301 --> 23:05.178
Throw that hat
in there, man.

23:05.303 --> 23:08.139
Oh, yeah. You know,
it was the only one I had.

23:08.223 --> 23:10.725
Not anymore.
Wear my old hat.

23:10.809 --> 23:12.727
8:00 tomorrow morning.

23:12.811 --> 23:16.189
Thanks, Benny.
Great. 8:00.

23:18.274 --> 23:20.151
Mom, guess what?

23:36.001 --> 23:39.546
Hamilton "The Babe" Porter.

23:39.671 --> 23:42.007
"Long-ball" Porter.

23:42.132 --> 23:44.009
Come on, DeNunez.

23:49.681 --> 23:53.143
Yeah, okay.
Yes, I see it. Yes.

23:58.523 --> 24:00.442
Whoa!

24:00.525 --> 24:03.570
You call that pitching?

24:03.695 --> 24:06.448
This is baseball,
not tennis.

24:06.531 --> 24:08.950
- Give him a tennis racket.
- Give me something to hit.

24:09.034 --> 24:11.286
All right, Ham.
This is my heater.

24:11.369 --> 24:14.664
- I dare you to hit it.
- You'll be sorry.

24:14.748 --> 24:17.334
- Give that boy a bigger bat.
- You want the heater,
I'll give it to you.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.961
Give him a basketball.
Maybe then he'll hit it.

24:24.966 --> 24:27.135
Oh, man!

24:27.218 --> 24:30.388
Yeah!
That's how you do it.

24:32.515 --> 24:35.018
Ham, you idiot.
Now we can't play no more.

24:35.101 --> 24:37.270
Great, you idiot!

24:37.395 --> 24:40.231
Hit me with the heater.

24:40.315 --> 24:42.484
Stupid idiot!

24:42.567 --> 24:45.695
Low and outside.
Just like I like it.

24:56.748 --> 24:58.667
I'm gonna hit you!

24:58.750 --> 25:03.838
Wait a sec. I'll get it.
- 1932 called shot
World Series by The Babe.

25:03.922 --> 25:06.591
Called shot by the Babe.

25:06.716 --> 25:08.885
No!

25:08.969 --> 25:12.597
No!

25:18.061 --> 25:21.690
- Smalls, come back!
- Hey guys, I'll get it!

25:21.773 --> 25:24.150
- Smalls!
- Smalls!

25:24.275 --> 25:27.278
- What are you doing?
- Smalls, wait!

25:27.404 --> 25:30.073
- Guys, what are you--
- Smalls!

25:30.156 --> 25:32.701
Get off!
Guys, I gotta get the ball!

25:32.784 --> 25:36.871
- No, wait!
- Get off of me! Now!

25:36.955 --> 25:38.873
- You're gonna get yourself killed!
- Killed, man, jeez!

25:38.957 --> 25:40.875
Stop!

25:42.961 --> 25:45.046
Holy crap,
you could've been killed.

25:45.130 --> 25:47.299
Yeah, yeah, truly.
What are you doing?

25:47.424 --> 25:50.260
You guys were leaving,
so I just thought I'd hop the fence--

25:50.343 --> 25:53.930
- If you were thinking, you
wouldn't have thought that.
- You can't go back there.

25:54.014 --> 25:56.391
- Then how do we get the ball back?
- We don't.

25:56.474 --> 25:58.393
- We don't.
- It's history.

25:58.476 --> 26:02.063
- It's history. Kiss it--
- Kiss it good-bye. Shut up, Tommy.

26:02.147 --> 26:04.649
It's gone, man. Gone.

26:04.774 --> 26:08.236
Game's over, man.
We'll just get another ball tomorrow.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.822
- Yeah.
- We'll never see it again.

26:10.947 --> 26:13.616
Why not?

26:17.037 --> 26:18.955
The Beast.

26:19.039 --> 26:21.082
What is that?

26:26.296 --> 26:28.173
Smalls, listen to me.

26:30.050 --> 26:34.054
Go to that fence... real slow,
and be quiet.

26:34.179 --> 26:36.806
- But... I-I think--
- No, no, no. No, no.

26:36.890 --> 26:39.517
- Just go and peek through that hole.
- But I--

26:39.643 --> 26:43.521
- But I saw something. What's back there?
- It's okay. Just go.

26:43.647 --> 26:46.024
- Just go.
- Go, Smalls.

26:46.149 --> 26:48.026
Come on, Smalls.

26:49.861 --> 26:52.781
Shh!

27:03.333 --> 27:05.210
Shh!

27:10.090 --> 27:13.927
- Shh!
- Be quiet.

27:18.890 --> 27:20.809
Something got the ball.

27:22.852 --> 27:24.938
W-What was that thing?

27:26.189 --> 27:28.066
Camp out.

27:36.074 --> 27:37.951
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

27:38.076 --> 27:39.953
- My mom made me put on my jacket,
- Shut up!

27:40.078 --> 27:42.247
And then she made me do the dishes.

27:42.372 --> 27:45.542
Your poor little mommy
made you do the big bad dishes.

27:45.625 --> 27:49.421
- Hey, you want a s'more?
- Some more what?

27:49.504 --> 27:51.881
No, no, you want a s'more?

27:51.965 --> 27:56.469
I haven't had anything yet,
so how can I have some more of nothing?

27:56.594 --> 27:59.431
- Shut up!
- You're killing me, Smalls.

27:59.514 --> 28:02.767
- All right. Who cut one?
- These are s'mores stuff.

28:02.892 --> 28:05.854
- Okay, pay attention.
- Bertram!

28:05.937 --> 28:08.189
First you take the graham.

28:08.273 --> 28:11.985
You stick the chocolate
on the graham.

28:12.110 --> 28:15.155
- Then you roast the 'mallow.
- No, it's my sleeping bag.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.699
When the 'mallow's flaming,

28:17.782 --> 28:20.327
Yes, it is yours.
It has a yellow stain on it.

28:20.452 --> 28:22.662
You stick it
on the chocolate.

28:22.787 --> 28:25.123
- You're gonna set the place on fire.
- Then...

28:25.206 --> 28:28.126
- you cover it with the other end.
- Make me one of those.

28:28.209 --> 28:30.128
Yeah, me too.

28:30.211 --> 28:33.840
- Then you stuff.
- I don't like that chocolate stuff.

28:33.965 --> 28:36.009
Kind of messy, but good.
Try some.

28:36.134 --> 28:38.720
Okay. Quiet, you guys.

28:38.803 --> 28:42.057
Shh! Shh!

28:42.140 --> 28:45.101
Quiet! Are you trying
to wake it up?

28:45.185 --> 28:47.771
It just went to bed.

28:47.896 --> 28:50.690
- What just went to bed?
- Shh!

28:50.815 --> 28:53.151
The Beast.

28:53.234 --> 28:55.820
- Oh, yeah!
- Shh!

28:55.945 --> 28:57.822
- Jeez.
- Dang.

28:57.947 --> 29:00.033
Shh.

29:01.159 --> 29:03.161
Now quiet.

29:05.121 --> 29:10.377
The legend of The Beast
goes back a long time...

29:11.670 --> 29:15.340
before any of us
could even pick up a baseball.

29:17.008 --> 29:21.846
Back to a place
called Mertle's Acres.

29:21.972 --> 29:26.851
It all started about, mmm,
20 years ago,

29:26.977 --> 29:30.814
when thieves kept stealing junk
from Mertle's Acres junkyard.

29:30.897 --> 29:34.275
So Mr. Mertle, the guy
that used to own the place,

29:34.359 --> 29:38.238
got him this new pup
from the dog pound.

29:38.363 --> 29:40.490
He fed him whole sides of beef...

29:40.615 --> 29:43.201
and turned the pup loose
in the junkyard.

29:43.326 --> 29:45.578
And the pup was grateful.

29:57.173 --> 30:00.552
And so, in a few weeks,
the pup grew into The Beast.

30:00.677 --> 30:04.180
And he grew big,
and he grew mean...

30:04.306 --> 30:08.476
so that he could protect the junkyard
with only one thing on his mind:

30:08.560 --> 30:11.229
to kill everyone
that broke in.

30:11.354 --> 30:15.775
And he did, and he liked it a lot!

30:15.900 --> 30:19.654
The Beast was the most perfect
junkyard dog that ever lived.

30:19.738 --> 30:22.866
A true killing machine.

30:22.991 --> 30:25.827
But after a while, the cops started
getting phone calls from people...

30:25.910 --> 30:28.705
reporting all the missing thieves,

30:28.788 --> 30:31.041
the ones The Beast had killed.

30:31.124 --> 30:33.918
It added up to about 120--

30:34.044 --> 30:36.296
173 guys.

30:36.421 --> 30:38.465
It's true.

30:38.590 --> 30:40.925
They never found a single body.

30:41.051 --> 30:44.137
Not one. Some people say
they all got away.

30:44.262 --> 30:47.015
But we all know
what really happened.

30:47.098 --> 30:49.059
The Beast ate them.

30:49.142 --> 30:52.979
He ate them bone and all.

30:53.104 --> 30:55.398
The Beast was too good
at his guard dog job,

30:55.482 --> 30:58.193
so the police said
he had to be retired.

30:58.276 --> 31:01.112
My grandpa, Squidman Palledorous,

31:01.196 --> 31:03.448
was police chiefback then.

31:03.573 --> 31:08.119
He ordered Mr. Mertle to turn
his backyard into a fortress...

31:08.244 --> 31:11.706
and chain up The Beast
and put him under the house...

31:11.790 --> 31:14.834
where he could never get out
to eat children and stuff.

31:14.959 --> 31:17.671
That's where he's been for 20 years.

31:17.796 --> 31:20.548
And that's where he'll be
for the rest of his life.

31:20.632 --> 31:23.677
Because Mr. Mertle
asked the cops how long...

31:23.802 --> 31:26.346
he had to keep The Beast
chained up like a slave,

31:26.471 --> 31:30.809
they said until forever.

31:30.934 --> 31:32.978
Forever. Forever.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.438
Forever. Forever.

31:35.522 --> 31:39.192
Forever.

31:39.317 --> 31:43.738
And so, The Beast sits there
under that lean-to,

31:43.822 --> 31:48.201
dreaming of the time when he can
break the chain and get out,

31:48.326 --> 31:51.913
dreaming of the time
he can chase and kill again.

31:53.164 --> 31:55.208
See, man? That's why
you can't go over there.

31:55.333 --> 31:58.003
Nobody ever has.
Nobody ever will.

31:58.128 --> 32:01.339
One kid did, but nobody
ever seen him again.

32:01.464 --> 32:04.676
- That ain't true.
- Yeah, it is.

32:08.388 --> 32:10.307
He got eaten.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.684
Nuh-uh.

32:12.767 --> 32:14.936
No. None of that's true.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.272
You guys are just making this up
to scare me.

32:17.355 --> 32:19.274
Oh, yeah?

32:21.359 --> 32:23.278
Stick your head
out that window...

32:23.361 --> 32:25.530
and look down.

32:28.658 --> 32:33.079
That night I
learned that more than 150 baseballs...

32:33.204 --> 32:36.291
had gone over that fence and not one
of them was ever seen again,

32:36.374 --> 32:38.293
even when some brave kid...

32:38.376 --> 32:40.670
worked up enough courage
to peek over.

32:40.754 --> 32:43.131
Because when they went over,
they vanished.

32:43.214 --> 32:45.133
I knew it was true.

32:45.216 --> 32:47.177
Because when I looked down in there,

32:47.260 --> 32:51.556
I didn't see a single solitary one.

32:54.225 --> 32:57.020
- He's down there.
- You bet he is.

32:57.103 --> 33:00.148
Whatever goes over that fence...

33:02.442 --> 33:04.361
stays there.

33:04.444 --> 33:07.989
It becomes the property
of The Beast...

33:08.073 --> 33:10.200
forever.

33:14.245 --> 33:16.915
- Come on, give it to me.
- No, I wanna carry it.

33:17.040 --> 33:19.417
- Come on. I paid for it.
- I wanna carry it.

33:19.501 --> 33:22.587
- Oh. Whoa!
- Give it to me.

33:22.712 --> 33:25.256
Jeez Louise.

33:25.382 --> 33:27.258
- What's the matter?
- Jeez.

33:37.894 --> 33:41.022
Wendy Peffercorn. Mmm.

33:42.357 --> 33:44.442
- Whoa!
- Wow!

34:04.296 --> 34:06.715
- Come on, let's go. We gotta get--
- No!

34:06.798 --> 34:09.384
We gotta get to the sandlot. Let's go.

34:12.304 --> 34:14.222
- Come on. Let's go.
- Okay.

34:16.181 --> 34:19.143
I'm sweating like a pig.

34:19.226 --> 34:21.146
Let's go! Come on!

34:24.858 --> 34:27.569
Where you guys been?
We've been waiting here forever already.

34:27.652 --> 34:29.612
Aw, Squints was pervin' a dish.

34:29.696 --> 34:32.991
- Shut up. I wasn't.
- Yeah, yeah, you were.

34:33.116 --> 34:37.203
Your tongue was hangin' out of
your head, and you was swoonin'.

34:37.329 --> 34:41.958
Oh, Wendy Peffercorn,
my darling lover girl.

34:42.042 --> 34:44.210
I said shut up!

34:44.335 --> 34:46.713
I've got a lot of things
on my mind.

34:49.882 --> 34:51.801
This pop isn't working, Benny.

34:51.885 --> 34:55.429
I'm baking like a toasted cheeser!
It's so hot here!

34:55.513 --> 34:59.351
It's 150 degrees out there.
You can't play baseball.

34:59.434 --> 35:02.479
- You have to call it for the day.
- You gotta listen to him, Benny.

35:02.562 --> 35:06.316
Vote then.
Anybody who wants to be...

35:06.399 --> 35:10.445
a "can't hack it" panty waist...

35:10.528 --> 35:13.948
who wears their mama's bra,
raise your hand.

35:14.032 --> 35:15.992
Yeah, I can handle that.

35:17.577 --> 35:19.788
Fine, fine, fine!

35:19.871 --> 35:21.790
Be like that.

35:21.873 --> 35:23.792
So what are we gonna do?

35:29.255 --> 35:32.550
Scam pool honeys!

35:32.717 --> 35:36.471
Benny would've
played ball all day, all night, rain,

35:36.554 --> 35:38.473
shine, tidal wave, whatever.

35:38.556 --> 35:41.059
Baseball was the only thing
he cared about.

35:41.142 --> 35:43.728
But of all the things
we ever did besides baseball,

35:43.853 --> 35:46.648
going to the pool
was what he tolerated best.

35:46.731 --> 35:49.275
Even though none of us had
ever seen a Playboy magazine,

35:49.401 --> 35:52.487
- which we constantly lied about,
- Hi.

35:52.570 --> 35:55.615
We figured going to the pool was
the next best thing to being there.

35:55.740 --> 35:58.952
I remember you.
Oh, sexy.

36:01.913 --> 36:04.040
Hey, girls.

36:09.546 --> 36:12.173
Cannonball!

36:19.306 --> 36:22.726
It wasn't really
the pool honeys like we said,

36:22.809 --> 36:27.230
because if any one of them
had come up to any one of us,
we'd have just peed our pants.

36:27.314 --> 36:29.607
We all went because--

36:29.733 --> 36:34.612
well, because Wendy Peffercorn
was the lifeguard.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.758
- Aw, man.
- Yeah, yeah. Too cool.

36:54.841 --> 36:56.801
She don't know what she's doing.

36:56.926 --> 36:58.803
She don't know what she's doing.

36:58.928 --> 37:01.139
Yeah, she does.

37:01.264 --> 37:03.933
She knows exactly
what she's doing.

37:04.017 --> 37:07.771
I've swum here every summer
of my adult life.

37:10.523 --> 37:13.234
And every summer,
there she is,

37:13.318 --> 37:18.782
lotioning, oiling,
oiling, lotioning.

37:18.865 --> 37:22.744
- One day it became too much...
- Smiling.

37:22.827 --> 37:25.747
- For Michael "Squints" Palledorous.
- Smiling!

37:25.830 --> 37:28.249
I can't take this no more!

37:28.333 --> 37:30.919
- Move!
- And he did the most desperate thing...

37:31.002 --> 37:33.254
- Lotioning, oiling.
- Any of us...

37:33.338 --> 37:35.298
- had ever seen.
- Lotioning,

37:35.382 --> 37:37.550
oiling.

37:45.642 --> 37:49.104
- What's wrong with him?
- What's he doing?

37:59.406 --> 38:02.033
Three summers of this.
I think he finally snapped.

38:02.158 --> 38:05.412
I don't know. But that's the deep end,
and Squints can't swim.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.701
- Somebody help him!
- Squints!

38:44.784 --> 38:46.995
Somebody help him!
Come on!

38:58.590 --> 39:00.550
Move back. Move back.

39:00.634 --> 39:03.762
- Okay, I got him. I got him.
- Come on up, Wendy.

39:03.887 --> 39:07.265
Everybody move back.
Move back. Roll him over.

39:07.349 --> 39:09.643
Never mind! Never mind!

39:09.768 --> 39:13.229
Come on, Squints.

39:13.313 --> 39:15.065
- Come on, Squints.
- Come on!

39:15.148 --> 39:17.567
Squints!

39:17.651 --> 39:20.987
- Come on, Squints. Squints.
- Come on, Squints. Come on.

39:23.073 --> 39:26.159
- Wake up.
- Come on, breathe, would you?

39:28.662 --> 39:30.830
Come on, Squints!
You can do it! Pull through, bud!

39:35.085 --> 39:38.129
- Come on, man! Come on!
- Yeah, yeah. He looks pretty crappy.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.968
Squints! Come on, man.

39:46.429 --> 39:48.723
Oh, God, he looks
like a dead fish.

39:54.312 --> 39:56.523
What?

40:01.319 --> 40:04.406
Little pervert!

40:04.489 --> 40:06.491
Oh, man, he's in deep shit.

40:22.674 --> 40:26.011
And stay out!

40:49.492 --> 40:51.661
Oh, hey, here's your glasses.
Did you plan that?

40:51.786 --> 40:54.497
Of course I did.
I been planning it for years.

40:54.581 --> 40:56.750
You guys, he planned that!
He knew what he was doing!

40:59.961 --> 41:03.256
Michael "Squints" Palledorous
walked a little taller that day.

41:03.381 --> 41:05.425
We had to tip our hats to him.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.927
He was lucky she hadn't
beat the crap out of him.

41:08.053 --> 41:10.889
We wouldn't have blamed her.
What he'd done was sneaky,

41:11.014 --> 41:15.268
rotten and low... and cool.

41:15.393 --> 41:18.313
Not another one among us
would've ever in a million years...

41:18.396 --> 41:22.400
even for a million dollars had the guts
to put the move on the lifeguard.

41:22.525 --> 41:25.195
He did.
He had kissed a woman,

41:25.320 --> 41:27.656
and he had kissed her long
and good.

41:27.739 --> 41:30.408
We got banned from the pool
forever that day.

41:30.533 --> 41:32.410
But every time we walked by
after that,

41:32.535 --> 41:34.412
the lifeguard looked down
from her tower,

41:34.537 --> 41:36.831
right over at Squints...

41:36.915 --> 41:40.085
and smiled.

41:52.055 --> 41:53.932
- Get your glove and come on.
- What's the big deal?

41:54.057 --> 41:57.769
- Night game. Come on. Come on.
- Mom, I'm going out!

42:14.327 --> 42:16.413
There was only one night game a year.

42:16.496 --> 42:18.665
- Guys, wait up!
- On the 4th of July...

42:18.790 --> 42:21.626
the whole sky would brighten up
with fireworks,

42:21.710 --> 42:24.504
giving us just enough light
for a game.

42:24.629 --> 42:28.550
We played our best then
because, I guess, we all felt
like the big leaguers...

42:28.633 --> 42:31.469
under the lights
of some great stadium.

42:31.594 --> 42:33.763
Benny felt like that
all the time.

42:33.847 --> 42:37.809
We all knew he was gonna go on
to bigger and better games,

42:37.892 --> 42:42.439
because every time we stopped
to watch the sky on those nights
like regular kids,

42:42.564 --> 42:44.774
he was there to call us back.

42:44.899 --> 42:48.737
You see, for us,
baseball was a game.

42:48.820 --> 42:51.656
But for
Benjamin Franklin Rodriguez,

42:51.740 --> 42:53.992
baseball was life.

42:57.329 --> 43:00.332
- Okay, hit it!
- Yeah, yeah, come on, Benny.

43:35.450 --> 43:37.619
Now wait a minute.

43:37.702 --> 43:39.788
I'm talking about--

43:46.586 --> 43:49.255
You know--

43:59.474 --> 44:01.518
Yes, He did.

44:04.104 --> 44:06.690
Man!

44:13.905 --> 44:18.201
- Come on! Hurry up!
- First!

44:18.284 --> 44:20.537
Run!

44:20.620 --> 44:22.956
Back off!

44:24.457 --> 44:26.543
Yeah, yeah!

44:26.626 --> 44:30.005
- Throw it in! Throw it in!
- Get him! Get him!

44:30.088 --> 44:32.507
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

44:34.134 --> 44:36.761
- Come on! Hurry up!
- Go, Benny!

44:36.886 --> 44:40.223
Oh, damn!

44:45.312 --> 44:47.772
Oh, no!

45:16.468 --> 45:20.347
It's easy when you play with a bunch
of rejects and a fat kid, Rodriguez.

45:20.472 --> 45:23.224
- Shut your mouth, Phillips.
- What'd you say, crap face?

45:23.308 --> 45:25.685
I said you shouldn't even
be allowed to touch a baseball.

45:25.810 --> 45:28.688
Except for Rodriguez,
you're all an insult to the game.

45:28.813 --> 45:32.192
Come on! We'll take you on
right here, right now!

45:32.317 --> 45:35.695
Come on!

45:35.820 --> 45:38.073
We play on a real diamond, Porter.

45:38.156 --> 45:40.408
You ain't good enough to lick
the dirt off our cleats.

45:40.492 --> 45:42.911
- Watch it, jerk.
- Shut up, idiot!

45:42.994 --> 45:44.829
- Moron!
- Scab eater!

45:44.954 --> 45:46.956
- Butt sniffer!
- Pus licker!

45:47.040 --> 45:49.959
- Fart smeller!
- Ah!

45:50.043 --> 45:52.712
You eat dog crap
for breakfast, geek.

45:52.837 --> 45:55.340
You mix your Wheaties
with your mama's toe jam!

45:55.465 --> 45:57.717
Yeah!

45:57.842 --> 46:01.012
You bob for apples in the toilet
and you like it.

46:01.137 --> 46:04.808
- Ooh.
- You play ball like a girl!

46:14.067 --> 46:17.445
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

46:19.239 --> 46:21.157
Tomorrow.

46:21.241 --> 46:24.160
Noon. At our field.

46:24.244 --> 46:26.162
Be there, buffalo-butt breath.

46:26.246 --> 46:28.540
Count on it,
pee-drinking crap face!

46:28.665 --> 46:30.000
Yeah!

46:30.083 --> 46:32.335
Let's go!

46:41.219 --> 46:43.138
We're gonna kick
their butts tomorrow.

46:43.221 --> 46:45.140
Yeah!

46:46.683 --> 46:48.560
- Good job.
- Jerks.

46:50.854 --> 46:53.690
Play ball!

46:55.942 --> 46:57.861
Hurry up, batter.

46:57.944 --> 47:00.947
It's gonna be a short game,
and I gotta get home for lunch.

47:02.574 --> 47:04.617
That's one.

47:04.743 --> 47:09.247
You know, if I had a dog
as ugly as you,

47:09.372 --> 47:13.460
I'd shave his butt
and tell him to walk backwards.

47:13.585 --> 47:15.712
The heater.

47:15.795 --> 47:18.757
Here it comes.
I dare you.

47:18.840 --> 47:20.884
Strike three.
You're out.

47:20.967 --> 47:25.555
Hey, is that your sister
out there in left field, naked?

47:25.639 --> 47:27.974
- She's naked.
- Shut up, Porter!

47:28.099 --> 47:29.976
Hey, hey, hey.

47:30.101 --> 47:33.021
I'm just trying to have
a little friendly conversation.

47:33.104 --> 47:36.524
Come on. You think
she'd go out with me?

47:39.152 --> 47:40.904
Come on.
Show me your stuff.

47:41.029 --> 47:43.490
- Let's see what you got.
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

47:43.615 --> 47:46.284
Take him out!

48:02.425 --> 48:05.679
- Come on!
- Bring it in!

48:16.314 --> 48:19.484
Oh! Beat ya.

48:22.028 --> 48:24.864
Throw it to third!

48:55.353 --> 48:58.523
We were all walking on air that night.

48:58.648 --> 49:00.525
It had been a solid victory.

49:00.650 --> 49:02.944
In fact, we beat the crap
out of those guys.

49:03.028 --> 49:05.363
So we all went to celebrate.

49:05.488 --> 49:08.199
And we did
the stupidest thing...

49:08.325 --> 49:10.243
any of us had ever done.

49:10.368 --> 49:13.330
Hey, guys, it's all on me tonight.

49:13.413 --> 49:15.332
Thanks, Benny!

49:15.415 --> 49:17.334
Nine tickets, please.

49:17.417 --> 49:19.336
- Hey, Benny.
- Thanks.

49:19.419 --> 49:22.339
- Hey, Benny.
- Benny.

49:22.422 --> 49:24.716
- Come on, you guys!
- What about me? Thanks.

49:24.841 --> 49:28.011
Aw, crap!
I almost forgot!

49:28.094 --> 49:30.221
- What?
- What?

49:33.350 --> 49:36.519
Chaw! I was saving it
for a good time.

49:36.603 --> 49:38.647
- What is it?
- Big Chief.

49:38.730 --> 49:40.649
The best!

49:40.732 --> 49:45.737
Jeez, Smalls. I suppose you don't
even know who The Babe is either.

49:47.697 --> 49:49.991
It's plug. Wad.
Chewing tobacco.

49:50.075 --> 49:52.661
- 'Baccy, man.
- What do you do with it?

49:54.913 --> 49:57.791
You're killing me, Smalls.

49:59.417 --> 50:01.836
- Chew it, of course. Yes.
- You do?

50:01.920 --> 50:04.631
Yeah, sure, man.
All the pros do it.

50:04.756 --> 50:07.217
Yeah, yeah.
Gives you tons of energy.

50:07.300 --> 50:10.720
- Let's dip. Let's dip.
- You got it, guys.

50:11.930 --> 50:14.641
Come on. I want some.

50:14.766 --> 50:17.102
- Mm. Mm.
- Mm.

50:17.227 --> 50:21.064
- The best.
- Let's ride!

50:21.147 --> 50:23.066
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

50:38.790 --> 50:40.709
Mm!

50:56.599 --> 50:59.769
- Yeah-hah!
- Yeah!

50:59.853 --> 51:03.231
- Whoo-hoo!
- Squints, this is the best!

51:03.315 --> 51:06.192
Wow! Yeah! Whoo!

51:06.318 --> 51:07.777
All right!

51:14.993 --> 51:16.911
Yeah!

51:43.396 --> 51:45.065
Blech!

52:29.401 --> 52:32.779
Oh, that feels better.

52:37.867 --> 52:40.912
I'll be back in an hour.
I'm gonna take your dad to the airport.

52:41.037 --> 52:42.956
Oh, okay.

52:43.039 --> 52:45.375
Honey, are you feeling all right?
You look kind of pale.

52:45.458 --> 52:47.377
- I'm fine, Mom.
- You sure?

52:47.460 --> 52:50.505
- I'm fine, really.
- All right.

52:50.630 --> 52:52.549
Listen, Scott.

52:54.968 --> 52:58.430
While I'm gone, you're the man
of the house. Understand?

52:58.555 --> 53:00.432
- Okay.
- Okay.

53:00.557 --> 53:03.351
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.

53:03.435 --> 53:05.437
On business for a week.

53:05.562 --> 53:09.024
- We'll take another stab at catch
when I get back, all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

53:09.149 --> 53:11.568
- Take care of things for me.
- Okay.

53:11.651 --> 53:13.570
- All right?
- I will.

53:13.653 --> 53:16.489
Okay. Be a good boy.

53:16.573 --> 53:18.575
- I will.
- Okay.

53:25.832 --> 53:29.336
A couple days after
we all got over acting like big shots,

53:29.419 --> 53:33.840
we swore off the hard stuff forever
and just stuck to Bazooka.

53:33.923 --> 53:36.676
But the day we all got back
together for some baseball...

53:36.801 --> 53:40.889
was the day I got us into
the biggest pickle of all time,

53:40.972 --> 53:43.767
and it all started with an omen.

54:54.838 --> 54:56.756
Oh, man.

54:59.217 --> 55:02.178
I don't believe it.

55:02.262 --> 55:04.180
- Bitchin'.
- Nah, it ain't.

55:04.264 --> 55:06.182
Come on. Maybe two or three
guys in history...

55:06.308 --> 55:08.184
ever busted the guts out of a ball.

55:08.310 --> 55:12.105
- Must be an omen.
- All's it means is that
we can't play no more.

55:12.188 --> 55:15.358
It's only 12:00, and I just ruined
the whole day for us.

55:15.483 --> 55:18.445
No, you didn't. That's the most
amazing thing I ever saw.

55:18.528 --> 55:20.780
- Yeah.
- Anybody got any money?

55:20.864 --> 55:24.117
No.
- Then it ain't okay, 'cause
now we can't play no more.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.119
Yeah, we can.

55:26.202 --> 55:29.205
What, you got 98 extra cents
lying around, Smalls?

55:29.289 --> 55:33.293
- No, but I got a ball.
- Go get it!

55:49.517 --> 55:52.729
I got it, guys! I got it!
I got the ball, guys!

55:52.812 --> 55:54.731
I got it. Right here, guys.

55:54.814 --> 55:57.359
I got the ball. I got it.

55:57.484 --> 56:00.028
- Here, Benny. I got it.
- Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups.

56:00.153 --> 56:02.072
- Here you go.
- Okay.

56:02.155 --> 56:05.367
All right. Come on.
Kenny, here.

56:05.450 --> 56:07.369
Come on. Yeah, come on!

56:07.452 --> 56:09.996
Batter up!

56:10.080 --> 56:12.207
Your fly's open.

56:14.167 --> 56:16.336
There's one.

56:19.047 --> 56:21.049
One, two, three.

56:21.132 --> 56:23.385
Three strikes, three pitches.

56:23.468 --> 56:25.387
Hey, batter, batter, batter!

56:25.470 --> 56:29.057
- Come on, Smalls!
- Hey, batter, batter, batter!

56:31.685 --> 56:33.687
Oh, my. Oh, man.

56:35.105 --> 56:37.023
- Run!
- Yes!

56:37.107 --> 56:40.402
Way to go, school meat!
I taught him everything.

56:43.989 --> 56:47.075
Oh, man, that was great.
That went clear over.

56:49.411 --> 56:52.622
Hey, uh, Smalls,
third base is that way.

56:52.706 --> 56:54.624
Hey, Smalls. Smalls.

56:55.875 --> 56:59.212
- Go to third.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

56:59.296 --> 57:02.465
Yeah! Nice hit, Smalls.
Nice hit. Yeah!

57:02.590 --> 57:06.011
- Oh, no.
- It's outta here!
Who's got the big bat now?

57:06.136 --> 57:09.097
- Smalls! Smalls! Smalls!
- Smalls?

57:09.180 --> 57:11.266
You forgot to turn.

57:11.349 --> 57:13.601
You go to third base!

57:15.812 --> 57:17.772
Smalls--

57:19.024 --> 57:20.942
What the hell's he doing?

57:21.026 --> 57:23.987
Maybe the shock of his first homer
was just too much for him.

57:24.112 --> 57:26.906
Yeah.

57:28.325 --> 57:32.162
Smalls.

57:33.747 --> 57:35.999
Smalls? Smalls.

57:51.181 --> 57:55.018
- We got to get that ball back.
- Oh, yeah, right.

57:55.101 --> 57:57.937
- Good one, Smalls.
- Yeah, good one, Smalls.

57:58.021 --> 58:01.107
Hey, forget about it, man.
Let's get another ball.

58:01.191 --> 58:03.026
No, you don't understand!

58:03.109 --> 58:07.155
Sure, we do. You feel bad
'cause you belted a homer.
Now we can't play no more.

58:07.280 --> 58:09.949
No, you don't understand!
That wasn't my ball!

58:14.120 --> 58:16.998
What do you mean,
that wasn't your ball?

58:17.082 --> 58:19.292
It was my stepdad's.

58:19.376 --> 58:21.503
I stole it from his trophy room.

58:21.628 --> 58:24.089
It was a present or something.
Somebody gave it to him.

58:24.214 --> 58:26.383
We gotta get it back.
He's gonna kill me!

58:26.508 --> 58:29.427
Ohh.

58:29.552 --> 58:32.180
Listen to me, Smalls.

58:32.263 --> 58:34.724
It's a matter of life and death.

58:34.849 --> 58:38.061
Where did your old man
get that ball?

58:38.144 --> 58:41.398
What? I don't know.
Some lady gave it to him.

58:41.481 --> 58:44.025
- Why?
- What? Some lady?

58:44.150 --> 58:47.612
Yeah. She even signed her name on it.
Some lady named...

58:47.737 --> 58:49.864
Ruth, Baby Ruth.

58:49.948 --> 58:52.158
Babe Ruth?

59:14.639 --> 59:16.850
No!

59:22.314 --> 59:24.107
The Beast got it.

59:24.190 --> 59:27.736
- You're dead as a doornail, Smalls.
- You're dead as a doornail.

59:27.819 --> 59:31.281
Smalls, you mean to tell me that you
went home and swiped a ball...

59:31.406 --> 59:33.867
that was signed by Babe Ruth,

59:33.950 --> 59:37.454
- and you brought it here
and actually played with it?
- Actually played with it?

59:37.579 --> 59:42.125
- Yeah, but I was gonna bring it back.
- But it was signed by Babe Ruth.

59:42.250 --> 59:46.421
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You keep telling me that. Who is she?

59:46.504 --> 59:48.298
What?

59:49.549 --> 59:51.593
What?

59:51.676 --> 59:55.263
- The Sultan of Swat.
- The King of Crash.

59:55.347 --> 59:57.932
- The Colossus of Clout.
- The Colossus of Clout.

59:58.016 --> 59:59.976
Babe Ruth!

01:00:00.101 --> 01:00:03.355
The Great Bambino!

01:00:04.564 --> 01:00:06.983
Oh, my God!
You mean that's the same guy?

01:00:07.108 --> 01:00:08.985
Yes!

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.989
Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest
baseball player that ever lived.

01:00:13.114 --> 01:00:16.117
People say he was less than a god
but more than a man.

01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:18.703
You know, like Hercules
or something.

01:00:18.828 --> 01:00:22.499
That ball you just aced
to The Beast is worth,

01:00:22.624 --> 01:00:24.918
well, more than your whole life.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:30.131
I don't feel so good.

01:00:30.256 --> 01:00:34.010
- Uh-oh, fan him.
- Give him air, give him air.

01:00:34.094 --> 01:00:36.304
We have to get that ball back.

01:00:38.556 --> 01:00:41.810
- When does your old man
get home from work?
- He's gone on business.

01:00:41.893 --> 01:00:45.814
Out of town.
But he could be back anytime.

01:00:45.897 --> 01:00:47.816
All right.
Find out when.

01:00:47.899 --> 01:00:50.819
And, guys, spread out and look
for bottles and cash 'em in.

01:00:50.902 --> 01:00:53.738
We need 98 cents.
We gotta buy us a ball.

01:00:53.863 --> 01:00:55.907
Yeah!

01:01:01.705 --> 01:01:04.916
- Come on. Let's go!
- Go, go, go, go! Move, move!

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:08.503
Come on. Open it up!
Hurry up, hurry up!

01:01:08.586 --> 01:01:11.298
- Give me the ball.
- Give me something to write with.

01:01:11.381 --> 01:01:14.384
- I got a pencil.
- Give me a pen, not a pencil!

01:01:14.509 --> 01:01:16.511
- Sorry.
- I got a pen.

01:01:18.263 --> 01:01:20.181
Babe--

01:01:20.265 --> 01:01:22.934
- Baby Ruthie?
- It says, "Babe Ruth."

01:01:23.059 --> 01:01:26.187
- I don't know, Benny, man.
- Yeah, boy, that looks pretty crappy.

01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.356
It doesn't matter
what it looks like.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.358
His mom's never gonna know
the difference.

01:01:30.442 --> 01:01:33.695
- This'll just buy us
some time, you dorks.
- Okay, come on.

01:01:50.795 --> 01:01:53.381
- Scotty?
- Uh, in here, Mom.

01:01:55.091 --> 01:01:57.844
Oh, hi, honey.
What are you doing in here?

01:01:57.927 --> 01:02:00.347
Uh, just looking at Bill's--

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:02.432
I mean, uh, Dad's baseball.

01:02:02.557 --> 01:02:05.852
You know he doesn't like
you to touch his things.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:09.439
Yeah. I-- I know. Sorry, Mom.

01:02:09.564 --> 01:02:13.443
Has he ever told you about that ball?

01:02:13.568 --> 01:02:16.696
Uh, no. Uh, not really.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.950
I-- I don't think so.
No, no, no, he hasn't at all.

01:02:21.076 --> 01:02:23.745
I don't-- I don't know
anything about it.

01:02:23.828 --> 01:02:26.623
Babe Ruth signed that ball.
He was...

01:02:26.706 --> 01:02:28.958
the greatest baseball player
who ever lived.

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:32.671
- Oh. Really?
- He sure is.

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.800
Your dad's father gave it to him.

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:39.302
Maybe someday he'll give it to you.

01:02:40.512 --> 01:02:42.847
Oh.

01:02:42.973 --> 01:02:44.849
Neat.

01:02:44.975 --> 01:02:47.519
It was salt in an open wound.

01:02:47.644 --> 01:02:49.896
Even my own mom, a grown-up girl,

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.565
knew who Babe Ruth was.

01:02:52.732 --> 01:02:55.276
I was dead meat.

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.822
We had thought that that ball Benny
had busted the guts out of...

01:02:58.947 --> 01:03:01.324
meant something amazing
was gonna happen.

01:03:01.449 --> 01:03:03.785
Now I just figured
it meant my life was over.

01:03:03.868 --> 01:03:05.954
Hey, I got it!

01:03:06.037 --> 01:03:08.164
Why don't we just go over...

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:11.418
and knock on the door and ask
Mr. Mertle if he can get it for us?

01:03:11.501 --> 01:03:15.672
Are you out of your mind? Mr. Mertle's
the meanest old man that ever lived.

01:03:15.797 --> 01:03:19.467
He's the one who made
The Beast eat that kid.

01:03:20.719 --> 01:03:24.347
It's not an option, Smalls.
Forget about it!

01:03:24.472 --> 01:03:27.934
Oh, okay. Sorry.
I -- I will.

01:03:28.018 --> 01:03:30.270
Let's just look out the window.

01:03:30.353 --> 01:03:32.480
Good idea.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:03.678
- He's daring us.
- We're on his territory now.

01:04:03.803 --> 01:04:05.722
Anybody got any bright ideas?

01:04:05.847 --> 01:04:09.434
After we'd
all thought about it real hard,

01:04:09.559 --> 01:04:12.729
we had absolutely no idea
what the hell we were gonna do.

01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:14.856
So things started primitively.

01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:21.237
Go.

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:28.703
- Farther.
- Farther, okay.

01:04:35.502 --> 01:04:39.255
- Just a little bit farther.
- Farther. Farther.

01:04:40.548 --> 01:04:43.843
Aah!

01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:47.013
Oh, no! Aah!

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:01.027
Farther.

01:05:04.114 --> 01:05:08.284
Go to the right a little bit.
Put the back to the right.

01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:14.374
A little bit farther.

01:05:14.457 --> 01:05:17.085
- Farther?
- Guys, I see it. Turn, turn.

01:05:20.964 --> 01:05:23.383
Almost.

01:05:25.218 --> 01:05:28.054
You got it. Pull it back.

01:05:28.138 --> 01:05:30.765
- I got it!
- Got it, guys.

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:33.935
Oh, my God!

01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:36.604
Pull it back! Aah!

01:05:58.043 --> 01:06:02.505
I think we've seriously
underestimated The Beast.

01:06:02.631 --> 01:06:06.176
Obviously, we're dealing
with a superior intelligence.

01:06:09.346 --> 01:06:12.515
- Power.
- Okay, guys, almost ready.

01:06:12.599 --> 01:06:14.517
We're connecting power now.

01:06:14.601 --> 01:06:17.145
Power connected.

01:06:33.286 --> 01:06:35.205
Okay, we're ready.

01:06:35.330 --> 01:06:37.832
Initiate retrieval suction.

01:06:37.916 --> 01:06:38.958
Initiate retrieval suction.

01:06:38.958 --> 01:06:40.627
Initiate retrieval suction.

01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:44.673
- Prepare to initiate
retrieval suction number one.
- Okay. Get ready, guys.

01:06:44.756 --> 01:06:46.967
Initiate retrieval suction
number one.

01:06:47.050 --> 01:06:49.552
Initiating retrieval suction
number one now!

01:06:53.723 --> 01:06:56.184
- Fire number two.
- Initiate number two.

01:06:56.267 --> 01:06:58.186
Firing two now!

01:07:01.606 --> 01:07:05.193
- Fire number three.
- Number three now!

01:07:05.276 --> 01:07:07.696
Whoa!

01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:13.201
Ha! You got it.
Haul it up.

01:07:13.284 --> 01:07:15.245
All right!

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:23.044
Pull it up.

01:07:33.596 --> 01:07:38.727
- What's going on, Squints?
- The pipe-- it's pinched shut.

01:07:40.729 --> 01:07:44.524
- Turn it off, man!
- I can't! They're shorting out!

01:07:44.607 --> 01:07:47.235
What the hell is that noise?

01:07:47.319 --> 01:07:50.572
The vacs are clogged. I don't know
about you, but I'm getting outta here.

01:07:50.655 --> 01:07:52.615
Let's go!

01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:55.952
Oh, no! Aah!

01:07:57.078 --> 01:07:58.955
Aah!

01:08:04.294 --> 01:08:06.630
Aah!

01:08:06.713 --> 01:08:10.634
Aah! Aah!

01:08:10.717 --> 01:08:13.136
They're gonna blow! Aah!

01:08:24.773 --> 01:08:26.649
Aah!

01:08:26.774 --> 01:08:29.319
Incoming!

01:08:58.014 --> 01:09:03.185
We've been going about this all wrong.

01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:06.439
I blame myself.

01:09:06.523 --> 01:09:08.441
We need total surprise.

01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:13.279
An airborne attack.
The Beast will never expect it.

01:09:13.363 --> 01:09:14.990
Yeah.

01:09:25.207 --> 01:09:29.004
- It's clear.
- Take me up.

01:09:53.903 --> 01:09:55.822
Let me down slow.

01:10:02.871 --> 01:10:05.373
- A little slower.
- Go slow.

01:10:05.457 --> 01:10:07.459
Go.

01:10:07.584 --> 01:10:09.544
Yeah, let me down.
Almost there.

01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:13.214
He's almost there.

01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:20.138
Let me down right over it.

01:10:20.263 --> 01:10:22.724
Let him down right overit.

01:10:38.782 --> 01:10:40.700
Ewww.

01:10:42.452 --> 01:10:45.080
Okay, I got it.
Get me outta here.

01:10:45.163 --> 01:10:47.415
Pull him up.

01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:55.924
I-- I-- I--

01:10:56.007 --> 01:10:59.511
- Hey, pull him up!
- Aah! Aah!

01:10:59.636 --> 01:11:02.222
Aah!

01:11:04.766 --> 01:11:07.227
Aah!

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:10.647
Aah!

01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:19.072
It was my last chance.

01:11:19.155 --> 01:11:22.492
So we quit messing around
and pulled out all the stops.

01:11:22.617 --> 01:11:25.161
I collected every piece
of erector set I had,

01:11:25.286 --> 01:11:27.998
and it finally became...

01:11:28.123 --> 01:11:31.167
science against nature.

01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:47.684
Okay, go with me on the launch.
Come on, Squints.

01:11:51.396 --> 01:11:53.815
- Prepare to launch.
- Prepare to launch.

01:11:53.898 --> 01:11:56.192
Prepare to launch. Launching.

01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:58.028
Launch.

01:12:23.053 --> 01:12:25.388
Okay, you're on the ground.

01:12:27.724 --> 01:12:29.851
Moving forward.

01:12:47.619 --> 01:12:50.163
- You went too far. Go back.
- Reverse. It's too far.

01:12:50.246 --> 01:12:51.831
Reverse.

01:12:53.667 --> 01:12:56.086
Stop.

01:12:56.211 --> 01:12:58.254
Drop catapult.

01:13:03.259 --> 01:13:06.262
- The catapult is dropped.
- Open catapult.

01:13:06.388 --> 01:13:09.015
We're gonna get it. I know it.

01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:10.892
Opening.

01:13:15.563 --> 01:13:17.941
Forward.

01:13:25.115 --> 01:13:27.534
Close catapult.

01:13:29.035 --> 01:13:32.539
- Catapult's closed.
- We're gonna get it. Come on.

01:13:33.915 --> 01:13:37.794
Aah! Fire, fire, fire!

01:13:44.467 --> 01:13:46.928
I got it! I got it! I got it!

01:13:51.057 --> 01:13:53.768
Aah!

01:14:23.006 --> 01:14:25.967
My life... was over.

01:14:26.092 --> 01:14:28.762
Just as Bill had finally
warmed up to me...

01:14:28.845 --> 01:14:30.972
and asked me to be
the man of the house,

01:14:31.097 --> 01:14:35.852
I had to knock a priceless chunk of
history into the clutches of a monster.

01:14:35.935 --> 01:14:38.563
Great.

01:14:38.688 --> 01:14:42.067
I had a dream that night
about a giant baseball...

01:14:42.192 --> 01:14:44.235
that was signed by Babe Ruth...

01:14:44.361 --> 01:14:46.821
falling out of the sky
and hammering me into the ground...

01:14:46.946 --> 01:14:49.449
like a railroad spike.

01:14:49.532 --> 01:14:51.534
I didn't know what that meant,

01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:55.872
but Benny had a dream that night too,
and his was a lot more helpful.

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.881
Who's there?

01:15:09.094 --> 01:15:12.889
Don't go pee in your pants.
I'm just here to give you a hand.

01:15:12.973 --> 01:15:16.184
- B-But you're--
- Dead?

01:15:16.267 --> 01:15:18.228
Legends never die, kid.

01:15:18.311 --> 01:15:20.230
But you're really him.

01:15:21.815 --> 01:15:23.733
You're The Babe.

01:15:25.068 --> 01:15:28.405
The Sultan of Swat.
The King of Crash.

01:15:28.488 --> 01:15:31.074
Of Crash, and a hundred
other dopey names.

01:15:31.199 --> 01:15:33.576
Forget about that stuff, kid.
We ain't got much time.

01:15:33.702 --> 01:15:36.705
- I'm here 'cause you're in
some kind of a pickle, right?
- Yeah.

01:15:36.788 --> 01:15:39.791
A baseball with
my John Hancock on it...

01:15:39.916 --> 01:15:41.876
went over a fence and you
can't get it back, right?

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.921
Yeah, right.

01:15:45.046 --> 01:15:48.550
- Then just hop over there and get it.
- Wait, wait!

01:15:54.472 --> 01:15:56.599
- I can't.
- Can't what?

01:15:58.268 --> 01:16:01.229
- I can't go into that backyard.
- Why not?

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.858
There's a beast back there.

01:16:06.192 --> 01:16:08.320
What kind?

01:16:08.445 --> 01:16:11.906
A giant gorilla-dog thing
that ate one kid already.

01:16:12.032 --> 01:16:15.118
Is that a fact?
Sit down, kid.

01:16:17.287 --> 01:16:19.372
Sit down.

01:16:25.587 --> 01:16:28.465
Let me tell you something, kid.

01:16:28.590 --> 01:16:32.052
Everybody gets one chance
to do something great.

01:16:32.135 --> 01:16:35.430
Most people never take the chance,
either 'cause they're too scared...

01:16:35.513 --> 01:16:38.099
or they don't recognize it
when it spits on their shoes.

01:16:38.224 --> 01:16:40.894
This is your big chance,

01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:43.229
and you shouldn't let it go by.

01:16:43.313 --> 01:16:47.150
Remember when you busted the guts
out of the ball the other day?

01:16:47.275 --> 01:16:51.154
Someone's telling you something, kid.
If I was you, I'd listen.

01:16:52.739 --> 01:16:55.158
Yeah. But what?

01:16:55.241 --> 01:16:58.078
You're the one with the rubber legs.

01:16:58.161 --> 01:17:00.163
Figure it out.

01:17:01.748 --> 01:17:04.125
"Henry Aaron."

01:17:04.209 --> 01:17:07.462
- I don't know why, but can I have this?
- Sure, yeah.

01:17:07.545 --> 01:17:09.464
Thanks.

01:17:11.549 --> 01:17:13.843
Wait.

01:17:15.845 --> 01:17:20.600
You're saying I should hop over
that fence and pickle The Beast?

01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:26.356
Think about that, kid.
I'll see you later.

01:17:30.652 --> 01:17:34.280
Remember, kid, there's heroes
and there's legends.

01:17:34.364 --> 01:17:36.992
Heroes get remembered,

01:17:37.117 --> 01:17:39.160
but legends never die.

01:17:39.244 --> 01:17:43.164
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.

01:17:47.002 --> 01:17:49.254
I had a dream. Get dressed.
We're going to the sandlot.

01:17:49.379 --> 01:17:51.548
Okay. Wait.
I'll get my stuff.

01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:03.143
Only one kid
in history had ever attempted...

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:05.854
what Benny was about to,

01:18:05.937 --> 01:18:07.897
and he got eaten.

01:18:07.981 --> 01:18:11.359
So we were worried--
real worried--

01:18:11.443 --> 01:18:14.279
even when Benny brought out
the secret weapon:

01:18:14.404 --> 01:18:18.575
shoes guaranteed to make a kid
run faster and jump higher,

01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:20.577
P.F. Flyers.

01:18:20.702 --> 01:18:23.872
We can't let him do this, man.

01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:42.891
Benny, wait.

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:46.019
It's okay.

01:18:46.102 --> 01:18:48.063
It was my fault.

01:18:50.148 --> 01:18:52.317
You don't have to do this.

01:18:52.442 --> 01:18:56.071
Yeah. Come on, Benny, man. You don't
have to do it. Forget about it.

01:18:56.196 --> 01:18:59.032
It's like committing suicide,
Benny. Don't do it.

01:18:59.115 --> 01:19:01.451
- Yeah, don't do it, Benny.
- Yeah.

01:19:01.576 --> 01:19:03.286
Don't do it.
It's suicide.

01:19:03.411 --> 01:19:05.622
Yeah, I do, Smalls.

01:19:07.082 --> 01:19:09.542
I have to do this.

01:19:17.926 --> 01:19:19.803
Heroes get remembered,

01:19:19.928 --> 01:19:21.930
but legends never die.

01:19:22.013 --> 01:19:25.809
Follow your heart, kid,
and you'll never go wrong.

01:21:33.103 --> 01:21:35.730
Whoa!

01:21:38.525 --> 01:21:41.444
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:44.948
- Yeah! All right, Benny!
- Oh, shit!

01:21:58.086 --> 01:22:02.132
Come on! What are we waiting for?
Let's get him!

01:22:10.056 --> 01:22:13.601
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet...

01:22:13.727 --> 01:22:16.313
or a silver knife
or a stick...

01:22:16.438 --> 01:22:18.940
- with a silver handle.
- You're insane.

01:22:24.446 --> 01:22:26.406
Aah!

01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:29.117
Ohh!

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.746
- The wolf bit you, didn't he?
- Yeah, he did.

01:22:37.334 --> 01:22:41.171
Go now.
And heaven help you.

01:23:51.616 --> 01:23:55.537
Look out! Aah!

01:23:58.456 --> 01:24:01.418
Hey! Hey!

01:24:07.132 --> 01:24:10.051
Hey, hey, hey! Kids!

01:24:12.762 --> 01:24:15.015
Put it down.
Careful, careful.

01:24:16.391 --> 01:24:18.935
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:22.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:24:32.782 --> 01:24:34.743
Mommy, Mommy, look.
A doggy!

01:24:37.454 --> 01:24:41.291
Ooh, a big doggy.

01:24:45.754 --> 01:24:48.256
- Ohh!
- Look out! Look out!

01:24:48.381 --> 01:24:50.717
Look out!
Sandlot, sandlot, sandlot!

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:53.053
Sandlot!
Let's go!

01:24:53.136 --> 01:24:56.431
This way! Sandlot!
Shortcut, you guys! Let's go!

01:25:10.695 --> 01:25:12.989
Where is he?

01:25:13.114 --> 01:25:14.991
Does anyone see him?

01:25:15.116 --> 01:25:17.285
I don't see him.

01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:25.210
There he is!

01:25:33.259 --> 01:25:35.178
Oh, no.

01:25:57.617 --> 01:26:01.538
Aah!

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.635
Look out!

01:26:45.582 --> 01:26:48.251
Oh, man.

01:26:48.376 --> 01:26:50.420
Oh, man.

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:02.849
Come on, guys.
Help me!

01:27:02.932 --> 01:27:04.851
Please!

01:27:07.562 --> 01:27:12.275
Benny! Benny,
help me, please! He's hurt!

01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:17.781
Come on.
I can't lift it.

01:28:14.754 --> 01:28:16.673
Let's go.

01:28:29.853 --> 01:28:32.022
Wow!

01:28:35.817 --> 01:28:37.736
Aw.

01:28:44.576 --> 01:28:47.996
- Wow!
- Now we can play forever.

01:29:10.393 --> 01:29:12.270
Hello?

01:29:12.395 --> 01:29:14.689
This is bad.

01:29:14.773 --> 01:29:16.691
This is very bad.

01:29:16.775 --> 01:29:19.861
Um, we-- we--
we brought your dog home.

01:29:19.986 --> 01:29:22.489
Hercules?

01:29:22.572 --> 01:29:24.491
How'd he get out?

01:29:24.574 --> 01:29:28.411
I'm telling you guys,
we should've just turned it loose.

01:29:29.704 --> 01:29:32.040
Um, uh, well, uh-- We, uh--

01:29:32.123 --> 01:29:36.419
What happened was, we hit a baseball
into your yard. We tried to get it back.

01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:40.423
- So you're the ones that've
been making all that racket.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:40.548 --> 01:29:42.634
You get it?

01:29:42.759 --> 01:29:45.971
Um, y-yeah.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.809
Well, first time...

01:29:50.934 --> 01:29:54.729
that anybody ever got
the best of old Hercules.

01:29:54.813 --> 01:29:58.233
Why didn't you just knock on the door?
I'd have gotten it for you.

01:29:58.316 --> 01:30:00.110
Oh, my God!

01:30:00.235 --> 01:30:02.278
I can't believe you!

01:30:02.404 --> 01:30:06.116
- We got the ball back, didn't we?
- We almost got killed!

01:30:06.241 --> 01:30:09.703
Didn't we get the ball back?
Just shut up!

01:30:11.788 --> 01:30:13.707
We got the ball back.

01:30:18.670 --> 01:30:21.423
Thanks for bringing him home.

01:30:21.506 --> 01:30:24.092
Come on in.

01:30:28.305 --> 01:30:30.849
We'll talk about this baseball.

01:30:30.974 --> 01:30:32.851
Come on.

01:30:42.485 --> 01:30:44.988
You in trouble,
aren't you, son?

01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:50.201
Yeah, well, uh,
that was my stepdad's ball.

01:30:50.327 --> 01:30:53.413
I took it without asking.

01:30:53.496 --> 01:30:57.000
- It was signed by Babe Ruth.
- George signed this?

01:30:57.125 --> 01:30:59.836
George Herman Ruth?
Yeah.

01:30:59.961 --> 01:31:03.965
I take it back. You're not in trouble.
You're dead where you stand.

01:31:06.593 --> 01:31:08.511
Hold on.

01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:12.474
Hold on.

01:31:28.198 --> 01:31:30.533
Here.

01:31:32.118 --> 01:31:35.121
I'll trade ya.

01:31:35.205 --> 01:31:38.625
That's nice of you, but that ball
really is signed by Babe Ruth.

01:31:38.708 --> 01:31:43.046
So's this one, with the rest
of the 1927 Yankees.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.302
Oh, man.
Murderer's Row!

01:31:49.386 --> 01:31:51.888
Lou Gehrig!

01:31:51.972 --> 01:31:55.350
Babe Ruth! But why would you trade?

01:31:55.433 --> 01:31:57.102
That one's all chewed up.

01:31:57.227 --> 01:32:00.021
I got a lot of good stuff.
Look at that stuff.

01:32:00.105 --> 01:32:03.358
Besides, you need it
more than I do.

01:32:17.455 --> 01:32:19.374
You knew Babe Ruth?

01:32:19.457 --> 01:32:23.420
George? I sure did.
And he knew me.

01:32:23.503 --> 01:32:27.215
He was almost as great
a hitter as I was.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:31.344
- I would've broken his record, but--
- You went blind.

01:32:31.428 --> 01:32:33.888
Yep. I used to crowd the plate...

01:32:33.972 --> 01:32:37.851
so the strike zone
almost disappeared.

01:32:37.934 --> 01:32:40.437
Pitchers hate that.

01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:44.899
That's the way I played--
100 % all the time.

01:32:44.983 --> 01:32:48.153
Baseball was life.

01:32:48.278 --> 01:32:51.239
And I was good at it, real good.

01:32:51.364 --> 01:32:53.783
And then... one day,

01:32:53.908 --> 01:32:55.952
a high fast one, and pow,

01:32:56.077 --> 01:32:58.204
lights went out.

01:33:01.207 --> 01:33:04.002
I don't think we
could take this ball.

01:33:04.127 --> 01:33:06.046
I'll tell you what.

01:33:06.129 --> 01:33:10.759
You guys come by once a week
and talk baseball with me,
we'll call it an even trade.

01:33:15.847 --> 01:33:17.766
Deal!

01:33:19.601 --> 01:33:22.646
Even though
Bill loved the Murderer's Row ball,

01:33:22.771 --> 01:33:25.398
he was still plenty mad
about me having swiped...

01:33:25.482 --> 01:33:29.235
his Babe Ruth autographed ball
and ruining it.

01:33:29.319 --> 01:33:33.281
So I didn't feel too bad when
he grounded me for a week...

01:33:33.365 --> 01:33:35.659
instead of the rest of my life.

01:33:35.742 --> 01:33:37.911
Wow!

01:33:37.994 --> 01:33:40.288
Things worked out
between me and him.

01:33:40.372 --> 01:33:42.791
And from then on,
I didn't have any trouble...

01:33:42.874 --> 01:33:46.628
just calling him Dad
all the time.

01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:50.590
We all lived together
in the neighborhood
for a couple of more years--

01:33:50.674 --> 01:33:53.802
mostly through junior high school--
and every summer was great.

01:33:53.927 --> 01:33:57.263
But none of them ever came
close to that first one.

01:33:57.347 --> 01:33:59.432
When one guy would move away,

01:33:59.516 --> 01:34:02.602
we never replaced him
on the team with anyone else.

01:34:02.686 --> 01:34:06.106
We just kept the game going
like he was still there.

01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:08.441
You're starting
to hurt my hand.

01:34:08.525 --> 01:34:10.610
Don't miss it!

01:34:10.777 --> 01:34:13.113
It was weird that Benny said...

01:34:13.196 --> 01:34:17.617
Babe Ruth was like the Hercules
of baseball, and The Beast's
name ended up being Hercules.

01:34:17.701 --> 01:34:20.203
None of us could figure out
what that meant,

01:34:20.286 --> 01:34:22.539
but we were all amazed by it.

01:34:22.664 --> 01:34:24.624
I kept in touch with those guys
over the years,

01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:28.295
and I found out that Yeah- Yeah's parents
shipped him off to military school.

01:34:28.378 --> 01:34:32.257
After the army, he became one of the
pioneering developers of bungee jumping.

01:34:32.382 --> 01:34:34.217
Of course, we all know why.

01:34:34.342 --> 01:34:37.512
Bertram, well-- Bertram got
really into the '60s,

01:34:37.595 --> 01:34:39.639
and no one ever saw him again.

01:34:39.723 --> 01:34:43.643
Timmy and Tommy became
an architect and a contractor.

01:34:43.727 --> 01:34:46.062
They started out small,
designing playground equipment...

01:34:46.146 --> 01:34:48.273
and prefabricated tree houses.

01:34:48.398 --> 01:34:50.275
But they became
multimillionaires...

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:54.237
when they invented
mini-malls.

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:56.823
Squints grew up and married
Wendy Peffercorn.

01:34:56.906 --> 01:34:58.908
They have nine kids.

01:34:59.034 --> 01:35:02.704
They bought Vincent's Drugstore,
and they still own it to this day.

01:35:02.787 --> 01:35:05.540
Hamilton Porter became
a professional wrestler.

01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:07.876
You know him
as The Great Hambino.

01:35:07.959 --> 01:35:12.672
DeNunez played triple-A ball,
but he never got to the majors.

01:35:12.756 --> 01:35:15.550
He owns his own business now,
and he coaches a little league team...

01:35:15.634 --> 01:35:19.220
that his sons play on
called the Heaters.

01:35:19.304 --> 01:35:22.766
Hercules lived
to be 199 years old--

01:35:22.891 --> 01:35:24.768
uh, in doggy years.

01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:27.771
I was the last one
to move away.

01:35:27.896 --> 01:35:31.066
But when I did,
the sandlot was still there.

01:35:31.191 --> 01:35:35.028
After Benny pickled The Beast,
his reputation spread all over town.

01:35:35.111 --> 01:35:38.698
From then on, he was known as
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez.

01:35:38.782 --> 01:35:42.369
And the nickname stuck with him
for the rest of his life.

01:35:42.452 --> 01:35:45.038
Now pinch running
for the Los Angeles Dodgers,

01:35:45.121 --> 01:35:48.958
Benny "The Jet" Rodriguez!

01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:53.463
It is the clutch situation
of the season.

01:35:53.588 --> 01:35:56.299
They say The Jet's lost
a step or two,

01:35:56.424 --> 01:36:00.136
but I wouldn't be surprised
to see some fireworks here.

01:36:02.430 --> 01:36:06.434
The Jet's got
a suicide lead and--

01:36:06.518 --> 01:36:09.312
And there he goes! He's stealing home!
I don't believe it!

01:36:09.396 --> 01:36:12.315
He's stealing home!

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:15.819
He's stealing home,
and they don't see him! The pitch!

01:36:22.993 --> 01:36:25.912
He's hit the dirt!
He's safe! Safe!

01:36:25.996 --> 01:36:29.040
Oh, my God!

01:36:31.042 --> 01:36:33.253
Safe! Safe! Safe!

01:36:33.336 --> 01:36:37.674
I don't believe it! The Jet
stole home! The Jet stole home!

01:37:06.786 --> 01:37:08.038
Andante

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.136
