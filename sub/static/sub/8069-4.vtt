00:03.371 --> 00:06.274
[theme music playing]

00:54.355 --> 00:55.789
Mom.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.358
Darlene used my
hair brush again.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.460
Oh, what'd I tell
you that bothering me

00:59.493 --> 01:01.028
when I'm ragging on your dad?

01:01.061 --> 01:02.530
Well, when will you be done?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.031
Never.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.233
Dan.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.968
Honey, I've got three
hours of work to do here.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.970
OK, so we'll go to the movies.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.207
Then we'll come home, and
I'll do it in one hour.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.543
Forget about it.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.910
Come on, Dan.

01:16.944 --> 01:19.247
This-- this is my final offer.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.615
We go to the movies,
which I've really,

01:21.649 --> 01:24.685
really have been looking forward
to ever since you promised me.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.887
The old guilt shot.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.990
And then tomorrow,
I'll come down to work

01:30.023 --> 01:32.993
and I'll straighten
out your life as usual.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.995
I can't just bring
you down there.

01:35.028 --> 01:36.864
Sure you can.

01:36.897 --> 01:37.998
What's everybody going to say?

01:38.031 --> 01:40.067
Uh, get that gorgeous
broad out of here.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.702
She's getting us organized.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.604
They were supposed
to hire somebody.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.072
Well, they obviously haven't.

01:45.105 --> 01:49.843
Well, wish I could.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.379
Ah, come on, Dan.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.746
It's 20 to 8:00.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.881
You'll run out of time here.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.686
We could do that trick
with the popcorn box.

02:08.796 --> 02:12.633
So they are going at it like
there's no tomorrow, you know?

02:12.666 --> 02:13.534
And, uh--

02:13.567 --> 02:14.435
DAN: Ahem.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.270
Hi, honey.

02:16.304 --> 02:18.706
You gents ready to
do some actual work?

02:18.739 --> 02:19.940
Not really.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.808
But we don't mind watching.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.013
See you later, babe.

02:26.046 --> 02:26.980
Kiss, kiss.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.919
Not in front of the guys.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.425
CREW MEMBERS: Woo!

02:37.458 --> 02:38.326
Shut up!

02:45.266 --> 02:46.367
Good morning.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.436
This is Roseanne at the
Magazine Discount House,

02:48.469 --> 02:50.838
and since you're a
preferred customer--

02:50.871 --> 02:52.840
and if we don't have those
bulldozers here this afternoon,

02:52.873 --> 02:54.375
I'll have to take my
business elsewhere.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.244
Am I making myself understood?

02:59.413 --> 03:00.281
Hi.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.015
Hi.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.551
You must be the new girl.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.018
Oh, new at what?

03:05.052 --> 03:06.720
Well, who hired you?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.621
Nobody.

03:07.655 --> 03:08.822
I'm just here for
the day, helping

03:08.856 --> 03:10.724
out my husband Dan Conner.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.859
He's doing the drywall.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.494
Oh, yeah, Dan.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.728
You know, he is terrific.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.397
He drives the blue pickup.

03:16.430 --> 03:21.335
Yeah, well, status is
everything in Lanford.

03:21.369 --> 03:24.171
You know, I don't suppose
you happened upon a building

03:24.204 --> 03:25.573
and safety certificate?

03:25.606 --> 03:26.474
Oh, yeah.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.276
It's right here.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.010
BURT: Hey.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.513
I am impressed.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.181
Oh.
Thank you.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.115
Thank you.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.650
Thank you.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.118
Oh, um, Burt Drucker.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.453
Oh, you're the architect.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.322
Mm, word's out.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.756
Pleased to meet you.

03:42.790 --> 03:43.657
Roseanne.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.025
Roseanne.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.427
It's a nice name.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.128
Yeah, it means underpaid.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.634
BURT: So, how much
are they paying you?

03:53.667 --> 03:54.902
Oh, nothing.

03:54.935 --> 03:58.306
I told you, I'm just here
for today helping out.

03:58.339 --> 04:02.276
You looking for
full time work?

04:02.310 --> 04:03.377
Why?

04:03.411 --> 04:05.279
Are you looking for a
full time secretary?

04:05.313 --> 04:06.914
Well, I really need somebody.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.850
But it's only for six weeks.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.153
So, how do you feel
about working here?

04:13.186 --> 04:16.524
Well, depends on what it pays.

04:16.557 --> 04:19.493
I couldn't take less
than $9 an hour.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.394
Pays $12.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.063
I could live with that.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.097
You're hired.

04:28.302 --> 04:30.738
So you think the
cookies are ready?

04:30.771 --> 04:31.805
12 minutes.

04:31.839 --> 04:32.706
That's what it says.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.541
Let's see.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.645
OK, we're home.

04:37.678 --> 04:38.946
Stop whatever it
is you're doing.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.214
Hi.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.383
Oh, they're perfect.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.055
Hey, not before
you had your dinner.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.563
So, how'd it go?

04:55.596 --> 04:57.931
I got myself a new job.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.367
Congratulations.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.968
You mean you're
going to be coming

05:01.001 --> 05:02.202
home this late every night?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.103
Only for six weeks.

05:06.173 --> 05:07.508
Hey, Jackie.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.276
I'm going to need your help here
holding down the home front.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.678
No problem.

05:10.711 --> 05:14.014
You know how much I love
these little beggars.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.450
Hey, what'd I tell you
guys about eating cookies

05:16.484 --> 05:17.518
before you've had dinner?

05:17.551 --> 05:18.852
To use a plate.

05:18.886 --> 05:19.687
Right.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.323
Darlene.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.224
Homework.

05:24.257 --> 05:25.325
Did it.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.595
Yeah?

05:27.628 --> 05:28.929
Let's see it.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.565
I wish you worked nights.

05:31.599 --> 05:34.768
I do work nights, as a warden.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.103
Remember?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.138
Hey, I need you guys to help
me clean up the living room

05:38.171 --> 05:40.107
because we are having
company for dinner.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.074
Who?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.543
A guy.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.977
Uh oh.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.145
Here we go.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.246
Uh oh is right.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.115
Nah, you're going to
love this guy, Jackie.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.452
Because, you know, my instincts
about men are perfect.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.759
Usually.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.395
Roseanne, who is this guy?

06:01.429 --> 06:03.363
Supposedly, he's an architect.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.132
And he's single.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.400
And he's breathing.

06:06.434 --> 06:09.903
And he's heterosexual.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.539
Oh, sure.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.740
Build up my hopes.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.776
And he will be
here any minute.

06:15.809 --> 06:16.910
Are you kidding?

06:16.944 --> 06:17.811
Look at me.

06:17.845 --> 06:18.946
No problem.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.514
He loves greasy haired
women with no makeup.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.752
Aw.

06:24.785 --> 06:25.886
Oh, just relax.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.854
I told him to come as is.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.188
You look fine.
- No.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.657
I at least got to comb my hair.

06:29.690 --> 06:31.925
BECKY: Mom?

06:31.959 --> 06:34.462
Can I go to the Lanford-Buchanan
game on Saturday

06:34.495 --> 06:35.763
with John Erdman?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.531
He's got his license and
his parents are going to let

06:37.565 --> 06:38.966
him take their Thunderbird.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.133
But if he wrecks it, he's got to
pay for it out of the money he

06:40.167 --> 06:41.702
makes this summer.
- Uh huh.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.505
Condense that and resubmit
it in the morning.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.372
[doorbell rings]

06:45.405 --> 06:46.373
ROSEANNE: Mom?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.508
- Yeah, you can go.
- Thanks.

06:47.541 --> 06:48.776
DARLENE: I'll get it.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.778
ROSEANNE: Hey, Darlene,
you're on your best behavior.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.714
Yeah, right.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.985
I ain't kidding, Darlene.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.753
Hello, nice man.

06:59.787 --> 07:03.123
Welcome to our wonderful home.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.958
- Hi, Burt.
- Hey.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.059
Sorry I'm early.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.861
Oh, you're not early.

07:07.895 --> 07:08.762
Thank you.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.430
Yes, I am.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.799
But I don't want to harp on it.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.200
I have a tendency
to harp on things.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.234
I mean, not for too long.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.505
Just long enough
for people to query.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.407
Well, quit querying at him
and say hi to Mr. Drucker.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.109
Burt.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.577
Um, this is Becky.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.045
And that's Darlene.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.313
This is for you.
And for you.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.280
Hey, Burt.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.582
Can I get you
something to drink?

07:28.616 --> 07:30.417
I don't suppose you have
any diet black cherry soda?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.521
We just ran out.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.988
Let me see what we do have.

07:35.022 --> 07:36.624
We got beer.
We got cola.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.425
We got wine.
[vibrating noise]

07:38.458 --> 07:39.760
Sorry, Burt.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.863
Time's up.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.297
This damn refrigerator.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.340
And this is my
sister, Tina Turner.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.547
Tina, say hi to Burt Drucker.
- Hi, Burt.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.447
I'm Jackie.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.682
Nice to meet you.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.585
Nice to meet you, too.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.120
Oh.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.055
A cup.

08:11.592 --> 08:16.063
Well, why don't we
all sit down and relax?

08:16.096 --> 08:17.798
- Jackie.
- What?

08:17.831 --> 08:18.699
Oh, nothing.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.068
I was just saying your name.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.070
JACKIE: Oh.

08:23.103 --> 08:26.940
Roseanne, and Jackie.

08:26.974 --> 08:30.310
Got a great memory, huh?

08:30.343 --> 08:36.584
Roseanne, Jackie,
Becky, Dan, Darlene, and?

08:36.617 --> 08:38.686
DJ.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.422
Well, now that
we've taken roll.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.791
Hiya, DJ.

08:43.824 --> 08:45.325
I'm your Uncle Burt.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.827
You aren't my uncle.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.061
Oh, I know.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.730
But I don't have any nieces
and nephews of my own.

08:49.763 --> 08:50.598
Couldn't I just pretend?

08:50.631 --> 08:52.365
No.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.836
Oh, your kids are
great, Roseanne.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.638
You know, I really
love children.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.908
So you looking to
get married, Burt?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.010
Well, Yeah.
Yeah.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.312
I've actually been
close a couple of times.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.015
I even got set stood
up at the altar once.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.150
That is so sad.

09:10.183 --> 09:13.386
Crushing is more like it.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.387
Hey, how about you.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.288
Jackie?

09:15.322 --> 09:16.189
Have you ever been married?

09:16.223 --> 09:18.025
No.
No.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.292
I'm forbidden to marry.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.831
It's a religious thing.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.401
Well, I'm going
to keep on trying.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.236
Good.

09:31.304 --> 09:34.675
I mean, I really love
the idea of family.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.643
You know?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.712
Barbecues, and
cookouts, and holidays,

09:38.746 --> 09:39.913
getting up early
on Saturday morning

09:39.947 --> 09:41.815
so the kids can watch cartoons.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.450
Something tells
me you've never been

09:43.483 --> 09:47.520
puked on by a two-year-old.

09:47.554 --> 09:51.091
No, I've-- I've never
had a family before.

09:51.124 --> 09:55.062
I mean, a real family.

09:55.095 --> 10:00.033
DJ, remember this all your
life, because these moments

10:00.067 --> 10:01.869
are precious.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.806
I mean being here with your mom
and your dad and your sisters.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.275
Because you know
where I grew up?

10:08.308 --> 10:10.377
I grew up in a big,
sterile mansion.

10:10.410 --> 10:13.046
And do you know who
gave me my dinner?

10:13.080 --> 10:13.981
Butlers.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.282
Maids.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.650
People my parents
hired because they

10:16.684 --> 10:18.518
were too busy traveling
around the world

10:18.551 --> 10:20.721
to spend any time with me.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.122
Do you realize
that I didn't know

10:22.155 --> 10:24.524
until I was in the seventh
grade that my dad had

10:24.557 --> 10:26.727
a prosthetic knee?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.495
Prosthetic knee, DJ.

10:28.528 --> 10:31.331
He got it playing
football in college.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.334
But do you think he'd so much
as toss the ball around with me?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.836
No.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.138
No is right.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.072
Figured.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.215
This is--

10:48.248 --> 10:50.884
I mean this is great.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.053
Roseanne.

10:53.086 --> 10:53.887
Dan-o.

10:56.690 --> 11:01.895
I just-- I just
want to thank you.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.698
I mean, do you realize
how lucky you are?

11:04.732 --> 11:05.899
Dan?
- No.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.234
No.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.036
Roseanne?

11:09.069 --> 11:10.738
Do you realize how
lucky you are to have

11:10.771 --> 11:14.975
all these-- these beautiful,
precious people in your life?

11:15.008 --> 11:15.809
Jackie.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.413
Becky.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.482
Darlene.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.485
And DJ.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.256
Little DJ.

11:52.612 --> 11:55.783
DAN: The whole damn
defense is on the DL.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.851
This is Dan Conner
for Mike Ditka.

11:57.885 --> 11:58.819
Yeah, I'll hold.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.791
I had the weirdest
dream last night.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.393
I was on my way to
Oz with DJ and Toto.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.495
And the wicked witch looked
into her crystal ball.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.330
And Burt Drucker was one
of them flying monkeys.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.069
JACKIE: See?

12:16.103 --> 12:19.572
You know, I just can't
believe this insensitivity.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.009
Can't a person be vulnerable
without having to be crucified?

12:22.042 --> 12:24.945
In this house?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.047
You know it took a
lot of guts for Burt

12:27.080 --> 12:28.315
to say some of the
things he said.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.918
Boy, I'll say.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.187
That guy's a real cheese
dog in a hard hat.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.689
Oh, look who's talking.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.590
[doorbell rings]

12:37.624 --> 12:38.658
DJ: I'll get it.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.693
Hey, would you like
some more coffee?

12:40.727 --> 12:42.129
- I would love some.
- Me too.

12:42.162 --> 12:42.963
Jackie, two coffees.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.169
Whoa, awesome.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.004
What the hell?

12:51.038 --> 12:52.172
DAN: Wait a minute.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.406
Holy cow.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.642
Hey, sir, I think you
got the wrong house here.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.543
Hey, hold on.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.444
Hold on.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.411
Oh, Oh.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.147
"Thanks for dinner."

13:00.180 --> 13:01.248
Oh, my god.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.152
Who's it from?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.386
Your Uncle Burt.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.456
Oh, my god.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.791
Uh, we can't accept this.

13:11.825 --> 13:12.792
Mom, are you crazy?

13:12.826 --> 13:13.726
Where do you want it?

13:13.760 --> 13:14.627
Back on your truck.

13:14.661 --> 13:15.562
You got it, pal.

13:15.595 --> 13:16.629
BURT: Great.
Great.

13:16.663 --> 13:17.530
Great.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.499
It's here.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.169
Uh, this is
really sweet, Burt.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.270
But we can't accept it.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.905
Well, sure you can.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.106
Hey.
Hey.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.374
Time is money.
- Take it away.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.741
BURT: No, no, no.

13:28.775 --> 13:32.512
Just leave everything right
here and I will take care of it.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.882
Now, I know what
you're going to say.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.483
Last night was
very special for me

13:36.516 --> 13:43.123
and well, I wanted to thank
you in a very special way.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.927
Burt, are you going to
need a handkerchief again?

13:46.960 --> 13:50.263
You know, I feel like
you're my sister, too.

13:53.566 --> 13:54.401
Is that strange?

13:54.434 --> 13:55.335
For you?

13:55.368 --> 13:56.970
No.

13:57.004 --> 13:57.938
So?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.406
Oh, I hope you don't mind.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.708
I brought over
some of my laundry.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.144
Pretty tacky, don't you think?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.513
I know you would never say
that to me, but believe me,

14:06.546 --> 14:09.416
I know what I'm talking about.

14:09.449 --> 14:11.518
So, what's on the tube?

14:11.551 --> 14:15.788
"Visitor from Another Planet."

14:15.822 --> 14:18.258
Hey, you want to throw
those in the washer

14:18.291 --> 14:19.592
for your Uncle Burt?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.361
No starch, OK?

14:21.394 --> 14:22.662
Oh, listen to me.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.131
Some nerve I have.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.432
Whoa, Burt, whoa.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.366
Darlene, freeze.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.438
Give.

14:31.471 --> 14:35.943
[chuckles]

14:35.976 --> 14:38.078
You're right.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.846
You're right.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.049
Oh, just leave it here, Burt.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.816
I'll take care of it.

14:43.850 --> 14:49.122
So, what's
everybody doing today?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.090
Uh--

14:50.123 --> 14:51.191
We do the--

14:51.224 --> 14:55.328
Yeah, Saturday is
not a good day for us.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.730
It's really, really
not a good day.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.106
[noisy play sounds]

15:15.148 --> 15:17.250
Well, you have
enough of me yet?

15:17.284 --> 15:18.718
Uh huh.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.587
Kids get tired of me faster.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.123
Mom, can I take a bath?

15:23.156 --> 15:23.957
Please?

15:26.926 --> 15:27.794
Yes.

15:27.827 --> 15:28.628
Great.

15:31.498 --> 15:34.767
BURT: Kids are so pure.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.336
Do you know what he
said to me outside?

15:36.369 --> 15:39.572
"Burt, I hate you."

15:39.606 --> 15:43.576
Well, he probably heard
it from Becky and Darlene.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.014
You know, that's what
I love about this family.

15:47.047 --> 15:51.151
You're all so-- so
open and honest.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.353
Burt, sit down.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.188
No, at the table.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.423
This OK?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.357
Perfect.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.999
Burt, why are you like this?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.567
You mean obnoxious?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.303
Well, not just
the obnoxious thing,

16:10.337 --> 16:13.640
but the relentless,
needy thing too.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.544
Most people are too proud
to admit that they're needy.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.646
I mean, I tell you
this with every bit

16:19.679 --> 16:22.482
of honesty in my being.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.650
I have no pride

16:23.683 --> 16:27.120
And I believe that, Burt.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.422
I guess people just
can't handle that.

16:29.456 --> 16:32.159
Well, let me
ask you something.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.361
Now, how did you
get this far in life

16:34.394 --> 16:37.430
without somebody just
driving a big old stake

16:37.464 --> 16:39.999
through your head?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.602
Go figure.

16:42.635 --> 16:45.138
Well, have you ever going to
a shrink or anything like that?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.206
Oh, yeah.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.708
Three, four times a
week until I was 30.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.577
Believe me, I used to
be really messed up.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.216
Well, do you want
us to hate you?

16:56.249 --> 16:58.251
No, I--

16:58.285 --> 17:01.188
I want to be loved just
as much as everyone else.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.655
I'm just lousy at
doing whatever it

17:02.689 --> 17:05.392
is that people do to get loved.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.095
And to tell you the
truth, in my whole life,

17:08.128 --> 17:10.830
I've never really
had one real friend.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.802
Rosie, now.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.675
Stay.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.414
Is that any way
to talk to a guest?

17:31.050 --> 17:33.820
He offered to get
Becky a MasterCard.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.188
He's got to go.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.556
No, he doesn't, Dan.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.457
What?

17:37.490 --> 17:38.758
What?

17:38.791 --> 17:39.726
He's a human being?

17:39.759 --> 17:42.729
You got proof of that?

17:42.762 --> 17:43.630
And he has needs.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.132
Needs?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.533
Needs?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.001
He needs to get our kids credit?

17:49.035 --> 17:50.337
What kind of man is this?

17:50.370 --> 17:51.604
Well, just calm down.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.739
I'm making some headway.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.243
I think I can have him
out of here by February.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.245
He's out of here tonight.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.879
He's out now.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.949
Well, Dan, what did
he do that was so wrong?

18:02.982 --> 18:04.784
I mean, he-- he gave you a job.

18:04.817 --> 18:05.985
And he gave me a job.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.855
And he tried to give
us a refrigerator.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.123
And the only thing
he wants from us

18:10.157 --> 18:12.859
is just a little bit
of love and affection.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.396
Which happens to be the only
thing we can afford to give.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.964
You know, Dan.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.732
We are children of the '60s.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.668
And we're supposed
to love everybody.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.303
Remember?

18:23.336 --> 18:24.371
Just do it for me.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.843
(SINGING): Go ahead
and hate your neighbor.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.581
Go ahead and cheat a friend.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.083
Burt, you want some coffee?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.685
To go, right?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.820
No, to stay.

18:40.853 --> 18:44.191
Yeah, I'd love to.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.426
We're taking the kids
to the movies later on.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.794
You're welcome to join us.

18:47.827 --> 18:48.995
But?

18:49.028 --> 18:49.896
No buts.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.664
One but.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.066
If you're are guest, that means
you've got to be your guest.

18:54.100 --> 18:56.969
That means no buying
us dinner, no buying us

18:57.003 --> 18:59.706
major household
appliances and no

18:59.739 --> 19:01.208
establishing credit
cards for the kids.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.114
You guys are terrific.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.418
I mean, I've never met
anyone quite like you before.

19:11.451 --> 19:15.154
And we never met nobody
like you neither, Burt.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.191
I've invaded your privacy.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.692
I'm ruining your weekend.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.060
I've alienated your kids.

19:21.093 --> 19:22.829
And just think,
you hardly know us.

19:25.832 --> 19:26.999
Dan.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.368
Roseanne.

19:28.401 --> 19:33.206
This has been the best night--
the best weekend of my life.

19:33.240 --> 19:37.043
And I want to thank you in
the only way I can see fit.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.211
I'm leaving.

19:38.245 --> 19:47.153
Burt, Don't--
don't toy with us

19:47.186 --> 19:51.758
I mean, you've renewed
my faith in humanity.

19:51.791 --> 19:56.529
As you might guess, I'm
pretty bad at goodbyes.

19:56.563 --> 19:57.364
I'll see you at work.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.307
I can't do it.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.580
Oh, that's OK, Burt.

20:13.613 --> 20:14.681
At least you tried.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.182
DAN: Becky.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.216
Darlene.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.285
Come on.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.052
We're going to the
mall with Uncle Burt.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.791
Yeah, I could give it to Jackie.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.092
Hell, I don't know what
to hell to do with it.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.059
All I know is I've got to--

20:27.093 --> 20:27.727
Oh, just throw
it out in the yard.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.861
My back hurts.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.598
Oh, you think I don't
feel like a [bleep]..

20:31.631 --> 20:33.366
Damn, this thing's heavy.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.267
Oh!

20:34.301 --> 20:36.469
Shut up.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.704
Twist on it.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.705
Now turn it this way.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.139
Turn it like that.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.041
You're hitting
the [bleep] table.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.443
[bleep] the table.

20:43.476 --> 20:44.844
Open the door.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.279
ROSEANNE: Well, wait a minute.

20:46.313 --> 20:50.182
Get off my [bleep] foot.

20:50.216 --> 20:52.652
You've got to pull
it straight back.

20:52.685 --> 20:55.722
Because we have to make
a big [bleep] turn here.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.524
OK, well, honey,
help you out here.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.225
Just help straighten
me out here.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.694
Wait, wait, wait.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.229
OK, take it back straight.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.331
Straight!

21:04.364 --> 21:07.467
OK, now pull it out
wide to the right.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.435
To the right!

21:08.468 --> 21:11.371
Out this way.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.273
OK, now straighten it out.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.742
OK.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.876
OK, come on.

21:16.909 --> 21:17.777
No!

21:17.810 --> 21:18.911
You're hitting the door.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.513
OK, a little more this way.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.482
This way!

21:22.515 --> 21:24.417
This way.

21:24.451 --> 21:26.919
OK, great.

21:26.953 --> 21:27.754
OK.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.561
I'm going to kill
the son of a [bleep]

21:34.594 --> 21:37.830
if I ever see him again.

21:37.864 --> 21:40.500
