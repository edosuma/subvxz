WEBVTT

00:02.707 --> 00:04.331
All right, I'm getting my list together

00:04.356 --> 00:06.300
for my annual Costco trip:

00:07.832 --> 00:11.277
cheese doodles, cheese balls,
cheese puffs, cheese curls...

00:11.693 --> 00:12.810
What am I missing?

00:12.850 --> 00:14.220
Cheese.

00:14.703 --> 00:16.303
What would I do without you?

00:16.760 --> 00:18.081
Not have cheese.

00:19.656 --> 00:21.896
Fleetwood Mac!

00:21.921 --> 00:23.113
Oh, this is fun.

00:23.138 --> 00:25.042
Are we just hollering out band names?

00:25.067 --> 00:26.832
Sugar Ray!

00:26.857 --> 00:29.417
No, no, no. Remember, I got
you, me, and Charlie tickets

00:29.442 --> 00:31.650
to the Fleetwood Mac
farewell tour for tonight.

00:31.675 --> 00:35.064
Oh, yay, so much fun.

00:35.089 --> 00:36.285
I can't go.

00:37.277 --> 00:40.809
My ex-wife Bonnie is coming
in from Texas to meet John.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.942
But I did pay you for
the tickets, didn't I?

00:42.967 --> 00:45.061
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, thank God.

00:46.163 --> 00:47.963
But we're still going, right, Margaret?

00:47.988 --> 00:51.206
I mean, I lent Christine
McVie a sweater back in 1972.

00:51.231 --> 00:53.676
- I'd like to get it back.
- Well, yes, we're going.

00:53.701 --> 00:56.146
I cleaned out my daughter's college
fund to pay for these tickets.

00:56.170 --> 00:57.498
I mean, she's 35 years old.

00:57.538 --> 00:59.097
I think that ship has sailed.

01:00.198 --> 01:02.478
Anyway, I'm gonna go check
out the Shady Meadows van,

01:02.508 --> 01:05.004
- and we should be good to go.
- Uh, sorry, Margaret,

01:05.029 --> 01:07.648
the big van has been
checked out by the big man.

01:07.678 --> 01:09.318
I'm going to Costco.

01:09.343 --> 01:10.934
Ooh, that reminds me.

01:10.959 --> 01:12.434
Here's five dollars.

01:12.459 --> 01:14.981
Would you get me a hundred
pairs of socks? Tube.

01:16.088 --> 01:18.112
But, Hank, this is great.
Sid just bailed.

01:18.137 --> 01:20.458
You can take his ticket and
drive us to Fleetwood Mac.

01:20.488 --> 01:22.558
Fleetwood Mac? I hate that guy.

01:22.598 --> 01:24.198
It's not a guy, it's a group.

01:24.228 --> 01:26.198
All right. I hate those guys.

01:26.228 --> 01:27.797
Oh, come on, Hank. Please?

01:27.822 --> 01:30.298
My daughter was conceived
at a Fleetwood Mac concert.

01:30.338 --> 01:32.708
That's why her middle name is Tusk.

01:33.164 --> 01:34.844
Anyway, it's their farewell tour,

01:34.869 --> 01:36.903
and they're my favorite
band of all time.

01:36.928 --> 01:38.942
All right, but we going shopping first.

01:38.967 --> 01:41.437
And I get 80% of all your free samples.

01:41.548 --> 01:44.178
Okay, 70%. I'm not a monster.

01:44.218 --> 01:46.218
Oh!

01:46.248 --> 01:48.048
Bonnie is already here.

01:48.088 --> 01:50.688
Oh, I hope she and John get along.

01:50.718 --> 01:54.290
It may be a rom-com clichÃ©,
but I want my ex-wife

01:54.315 --> 01:56.658
and my boyfriend to like each other.

01:56.698 --> 01:58.805
There's my little man.

02:04.268 --> 02:06.438
You come here, you munchkin.

02:07.003 --> 02:08.973
Get yourself a face full of Bonbon.

02:12.376 --> 02:15.683
I forgot how much air
I need just to hug you.

02:17.118 --> 02:19.330
Are those hugs going around the table?

02:19.355 --> 02:22.488
'Cause I can hold my
breath an awfully long time.

02:47.523 --> 02:49.623
Check me out.

02:49.648 --> 02:52.623
- My Stevie Nicks outfit still fits.
- Whoa.

02:52.648 --> 02:55.588
Course, then again, I
guess blousy witch clothing

02:55.618 --> 02:57.486
always does.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.218
So, are you ready to party?

02:59.258 --> 03:00.888
Oh, yeah, I am. I got us covered.

03:00.928 --> 03:04.291
I got some weed gummies and some joints.

03:04.316 --> 03:06.916
- Mm-hmm.
- And some weed gummies

03:07.451 --> 03:09.154
and some joints.

03:10.168 --> 03:13.638
I started already.

03:13.668 --> 03:15.938
I'm packing a bunch of
airplane tequila bottles.

03:15.968 --> 03:17.938
It's my last chance to see Fleetwood Mac

03:17.978 --> 03:20.168
and I am gonna be lit.

03:20.722 --> 03:24.148
All right, before we head out,
I've laid down some ground rules

03:24.178 --> 03:25.678
for the Shady Meadow van.

03:25.718 --> 03:28.648
Since when does the Shady
Meadows van have rules?

03:28.688 --> 03:31.408
Patty Soupkins checks it
out every single week so she

03:31.433 --> 03:33.888
and her boyfriend can have sex
out there in the parking lot.

03:35.747 --> 03:38.487
Well, that may be, but I just
got my van privileges back

03:38.512 --> 03:40.603
after that unfortunate incident

03:40.628 --> 03:42.786
where, through no fault of my own,

03:42.811 --> 03:45.287
I drove a golf cart through
the wall in the dining hall.

03:46.738 --> 03:49.368
No food in the van.

03:49.408 --> 03:52.138
No drink in the van.

03:52.178 --> 03:55.478
No loud talking in the van.

03:55.508 --> 04:00.188
Come on, Hank. We're going to
a concert, not a church retreat.

04:00.218 --> 04:02.018
Don't ruin this for me.

04:02.048 --> 04:04.139
We should be cutting loose. Who knows?

04:04.164 --> 04:06.834
I might take my top off and let
the girls breathe.

04:07.188 --> 04:09.228
Yeah, come on, Hank, chill out.

04:09.258 --> 04:10.831
You're harshing our buzz.

04:11.268 --> 04:13.998
Nobody should be buzzing in this van.

04:17.026 --> 04:18.902
Unless y'all plan on bringing bees.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.578
No bees.

04:23.408 --> 04:24.808
And, uh, definitely no drugs.

04:24.838 --> 04:26.508
My van, my rules.

04:26.548 --> 04:28.508
- Okay, you got it.
- Yeah, we don't...

04:28.548 --> 04:32.378
we don't have anything.
M-Music is our drug.

04:32.418 --> 04:34.110
Don't make me frisk you two.

04:34.135 --> 04:37.688
I will be thorough, but
I will not be gentle.

04:38.329 --> 04:39.688
Okay. Here.

04:40.928 --> 04:42.720
That's all of it.

04:47.628 --> 04:50.598
You are going to love John.

04:50.638 --> 04:53.408
He is so handsome and smart.

04:53.438 --> 04:55.147
He was on Jeopardy! once.

04:55.172 --> 04:58.538
That's right, front row of the audience.

04:58.578 --> 05:01.678
Well, you keep going on
and on and on about him.

05:01.708 --> 05:04.201
I'm almost just a little
bit extremely jealous.

05:05.318 --> 05:07.913
There he is.

05:07.938 --> 05:09.407
Ooh!

05:09.432 --> 05:11.999
My boyfriend is meeting my wife.

05:12.024 --> 05:13.963
I feel so French.

05:13.988 --> 05:16.088
Bonnie, meet Johnny.

05:16.128 --> 05:18.128
It's so nice to finally meet you.

05:18.158 --> 05:19.900
Wow! You're a knockout.

05:19.925 --> 05:22.098
I know. Yeah.

05:22.128 --> 05:24.068
- And you're not so bad yourself.
- Thanks.

05:24.098 --> 05:26.098
Isn't he cute?

05:26.138 --> 05:30.324
John just moved back from
a very prestigious job

05:30.349 --> 05:31.378
in Atlanta.

05:31.408 --> 05:33.169
- Ah...
- Tell her

05:33.194 --> 05:36.473
about your prestigious job, John.

05:36.498 --> 05:39.308
I worked at the CDC as a caterer.

05:41.018 --> 05:44.955
Oh, I love Atlanta.

05:44.980 --> 05:47.420
Yeah, we, uh, went there for
our anniversary last year.

05:47.658 --> 05:51.828
Wait, you guys still
celebrate your anniversary?

05:51.858 --> 05:53.828
- Every year.
- What?

05:53.868 --> 05:55.482
Yeah, we make a great team.

05:55.747 --> 05:59.068
- Hmm... Ah.
- Yeah, we were cheerleaders together in high school.

05:59.098 --> 06:01.569
I was the base of the
pyramid and he was the top.

06:02.099 --> 06:05.359
I've had a lot of great
times on top of this lady.

06:05.978 --> 06:08.308
If only!

06:08.348 --> 06:10.948
Ah! Oh, oh...

06:10.978 --> 06:13.618
Oh, isn't he hilarious?
Oh, wait, watch this.

06:13.648 --> 06:15.381
Hey, Sid, make a funny face.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.088
Okay. Uh...

06:19.518 --> 06:21.917
Oh, my God,

06:21.942 --> 06:24.925
gold! 24-karat gold!

06:27.168 --> 06:30.218
You guys get along so well
together, it's almost a shame

06:30.243 --> 06:31.790
that you ever got divorced.

06:32.407 --> 06:35.368
Oh, yeah... well, we're
not. No, we're still married.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.240
I'm sorry, what?

06:42.678 --> 06:45.448
So, I guess...

06:45.478 --> 06:47.288
I'm a little confused.

06:47.318 --> 06:49.388
You two are still married?

06:49.418 --> 06:52.688
Well, define "married."

06:52.728 --> 06:54.534
Being married.

06:55.798 --> 06:57.729
Oh, well, then, yes.

07:00.481 --> 07:03.803
Ooh, you're jealous.

07:03.828 --> 07:05.888
You feel like my mistress.

07:05.913 --> 07:08.513
My dirty little side piece.

07:08.668 --> 07:12.139
Uh, the Marilyn to my JFK.

07:12.164 --> 07:15.030
I am not jealous.

07:15.678 --> 07:18.962
And between the two of us,
you are definitely the Marilyn.

07:19.424 --> 07:22.494
And that is why we work.

07:23.118 --> 07:26.858
Look, I know my relationship
with Bonnie is unconventional,

07:26.888 --> 07:29.028
but it works for us.

07:29.058 --> 07:31.028
Changing that would hurt her.

07:31.058 --> 07:33.513
I feel I've already hurt her enough.

07:33.538 --> 07:35.768
- What are you talking about?
- I feel guilty

07:35.798 --> 07:38.998
that I pretended to be
straight for decades.

07:39.023 --> 07:42.640
She thought she was getting
G.I. Joe, but she got Malibu Ken.

07:44.187 --> 07:45.578
Well, don't you think

07:46.203 --> 07:48.304
you're hurting her by
keeping her stuck in the past?

07:48.329 --> 07:50.822
I mean, has she even had
a relationship since you?

07:50.847 --> 07:52.096
Not really.

07:52.121 --> 07:53.891
Well, there was this
one really great guy,

07:53.916 --> 07:56.858
but he dumped her when he
found out we were still married.

07:57.963 --> 07:59.002
Oh...

08:01.846 --> 08:03.728
- Oh...
- Sid.

08:03.758 --> 08:06.928
I don't want to force you to do anything

08:06.968 --> 08:08.428
that you don't want to do.

08:08.468 --> 08:10.198
- But don't you think...
- No, no, no.

08:10.238 --> 08:11.274
You're right.

08:11.838 --> 08:14.478
We should have done
this a long time ago.

08:15.806 --> 08:18.078
I'm gonna ask her for a divorce.

08:18.108 --> 08:19.138
Okay.

08:20.508 --> 08:22.478
You don't happen to
have a helmet, do you?

08:22.508 --> 08:25.748
She's got a Southern
temper, I got a soft head.

08:30.188 --> 08:31.988
What the hell, Hank?

08:32.018 --> 08:34.312
I thought you said it was
gonna be a quick trip to Costco.

08:34.337 --> 08:35.727
That took forever.

08:35.758 --> 08:38.619
We watched you get an eye exam.

08:39.528 --> 08:41.212
Can we at least turn on some music

08:41.236 --> 08:43.498
- and get this party started?
- You got it.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.276
Maybe at a volume that humans can hear?

08:49.894 --> 08:52.064
Oh, sure. I turn the music
up, then I start doing

08:52.089 --> 08:53.448
a little dance in the front seat.

08:53.478 --> 08:55.054
Next thing you know, we're plummeting

08:55.079 --> 08:56.648
off a bridge to our death.

08:56.678 --> 08:58.148
And on top of all of that,

08:58.178 --> 09:00.318
I lose my Shady Meadow van privileges.

09:03.658 --> 09:05.088
This sucks, right?

09:05.118 --> 09:07.759
Big time. We have no
tequila, we have no weed,

09:07.784 --> 09:09.528
we're gonna miss the opening act

09:09.558 --> 09:12.459
'cause Grandpa Moses up
there won't go over 35.

09:12.484 --> 09:13.971
All right, brace yourselves, everybody.

09:13.995 --> 09:16.381
We may be coming to a speed bump.

09:18.738 --> 09:21.668
You know, I think I can
solve one of those problems.

09:21.708 --> 09:25.278
I have a... a secret stash of gummies.

09:25.308 --> 09:28.378
Oh, my God, Charlie, this is amazing.

09:28.408 --> 09:30.524
A little less amazing that you
pulled it out of your crotch,

09:30.548 --> 09:31.878
but I'm desperate.

09:31.918 --> 09:33.845
Yeah, they should be nice and warm.

09:33.870 --> 09:36.670
Yeah, they're a little
too warm. Are you okay?

09:36.918 --> 09:38.494
What's going on back
there? Y'all eating?

09:38.518 --> 09:41.658
You know the rules.
No eating in the van.

09:41.688 --> 09:44.128
I am not gonna let him ruin this night.

09:44.158 --> 09:46.211
Here, Hank, want some candy?

09:46.236 --> 09:49.698
Uh, yeah. Amendment
to that previous rule:

09:49.728 --> 09:51.968
the driver's allowed to eat.

09:51.998 --> 09:53.068
Especially candy.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.646
Ooh. It's nice and warm.

09:57.278 --> 09:58.646
But he's driving.

09:58.671 --> 10:00.490
It's one little gummy...
it won't even kick in

10:00.515 --> 10:01.948
till we get there.

10:03.518 --> 10:06.106
Oh, crap.

10:11.758 --> 10:14.388
What is going on with your feet, Bonnie?

10:14.428 --> 10:18.611
I've never seen a
pedicurist tap out before.

10:18.636 --> 10:21.336
Oh, come on, honey. You know me.

10:21.768 --> 10:24.068
My toes are like a carton of eggs.

10:24.098 --> 10:26.968
All 12 went bad at the same time.

10:29.068 --> 10:32.108
Now, Sid, you said you wanted
to talk to me about something.

10:32.138 --> 10:33.548
What is it?

10:33.573 --> 10:36.423
Why don't we whip up some juleps

10:36.448 --> 10:39.027
and I'll rub your shoulders first?

10:39.052 --> 10:40.218
Aw...

10:40.248 --> 10:43.367
Are you trying to knock me up again?

10:43.392 --> 10:46.890
Ha! You, madam, are a card.

10:47.242 --> 10:50.528
And that card, madam, is the Joker,

10:50.558 --> 10:53.728
which is the funniest of the cards.

10:53.768 --> 10:56.398
However, you're also my queen.

10:57.503 --> 10:59.690
Pick a card, any card.

10:59.715 --> 11:02.042
Oh, regardless, you are aces.

11:03.778 --> 11:07.648
Come on, Sid. Spit it out.
I know when you're stalling.

11:09.178 --> 11:11.478
I think we should get a divorce.

11:14.518 --> 11:16.818
Hmm...

11:16.848 --> 11:20.158
Is that a good "hmm" or a bad "hmm"?

11:20.188 --> 11:23.358
Oh, I think it's a bad "hmm."

11:25.328 --> 11:27.168
You don't want to be married to me?

11:27.198 --> 11:28.912
Oh, my God, I'm gonna faint.

11:28.937 --> 11:31.268
The walls are closing in.

11:31.298 --> 11:32.896
Bonnie, calm down, please.

11:32.921 --> 11:35.681
- Or at least break some of my cheaper items.
- Oh, my God.

11:36.008 --> 11:37.738
Oh!

11:37.778 --> 11:39.669
How can I calm down when you're trying

11:39.694 --> 11:41.248
to cut me out of your life?

11:41.278 --> 11:43.261
I don't want you out of my life.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.050
Then why are you saying all of this?

11:46.075 --> 11:48.261
Because... because I'm...

11:49.148 --> 11:51.558
John is making me.

11:54.820 --> 11:56.180
John?

11:57.128 --> 11:59.028
Oh, my God.

11:59.956 --> 12:02.769
I shouldn't have spent all this
money on this pedicure...

12:04.066 --> 12:06.768
when I'm gonna break
my foot off in his ass.

12:06.793 --> 12:08.513
No, Bonnie, no.

12:08.538 --> 12:12.028
He doesn't even live here, thank God.

12:12.053 --> 12:13.729
Hey, it's me, John.

12:23.714 --> 12:25.644
John told you to divorce me?

12:25.988 --> 12:29.128
- Oh, I'm gonna rip him limb from limb.
- No, no, wait, wait!

12:29.158 --> 12:30.603
I'm on your side!

12:30.628 --> 12:33.058
He does deserve a good limb-ripping.

12:33.368 --> 12:36.028
But you just got your nails done.

12:36.068 --> 12:38.073
So why don't you let me handle it.

12:38.098 --> 12:39.738
You stay put. Stay.

12:40.568 --> 12:42.338
Hey, sweetie.

12:42.368 --> 12:44.508
Oh, so you're coming out here.

12:44.538 --> 12:48.611
Well, I wanted to tell
you the good news...

12:48.636 --> 12:50.306
- What?
- ...before we went inside.

12:50.548 --> 12:52.978
I told Bonnie about the divorce.

12:53.018 --> 12:54.548
And she loved it.

12:56.218 --> 13:00.588
She is a big fan of yours, by the way.

13:00.628 --> 13:03.743
Oh, I think you two are gonna
be so much happier this way.

13:03.768 --> 13:06.368
So much happier.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.198
Oh, she is so...

13:08.228 --> 13:10.868
friggin' happy in there.

13:10.898 --> 13:12.668
Okay.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.627
Having said that...

13:17.708 --> 13:21.378
...um, let's not mention the divorce.

13:21.408 --> 13:24.248
- No?
- I'm worried about her getting too happy.

13:24.278 --> 13:26.548
Okay, um...

13:26.578 --> 13:28.118
yeah, could we, um...

13:28.148 --> 13:31.089
go inside, or, or are we
just hallway people now?

13:31.114 --> 13:32.144
Oh, oh, dude,

13:32.169 --> 13:35.114
we are going in there so, so soon.

13:35.139 --> 13:37.249
Just give me one sec.

13:37.428 --> 13:39.098
I love you. Lost a little weight?

13:39.128 --> 13:41.098
Have you?

13:42.128 --> 13:44.821
Welp, I bitched him out.

13:44.846 --> 13:48.386
I told him to mind his own beeswax.

13:48.668 --> 13:52.078
Long story short, he loved it.

13:53.248 --> 13:55.248
Big fan of yours, by the way.

13:55.278 --> 13:58.078
- Oh...
- Anyhoo.

13:58.118 --> 14:01.148
Guess there's no reason
to talk about the divorce

14:01.188 --> 14:04.218
now that it's been handled,
but just give me one sec.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.992
Oh, and here he comes.

14:07.017 --> 14:09.506
Just walked right in. Uh, that's fine.

14:09.531 --> 14:10.728
Little rude.

14:10.758 --> 14:12.804
Sid, your place looks wrecked.

14:13.523 --> 14:16.428
- Oh. His house is wrecked?
- Mm-hmm.

14:16.468 --> 14:19.068
Oh, ironic, coming
from someone like you.

14:19.098 --> 14:20.380
- Whore.
- Oh!

14:20.405 --> 14:22.705
Okay, hold on, did I do something wrong?

14:22.968 --> 14:25.457
Yeah. You forced him to ask for

14:25.482 --> 14:26.952
a divorce that he doesn't even want.

14:26.977 --> 14:28.447
- What?
- What are you talking about?

14:28.472 --> 14:30.004
I didn't force him to do anything.

14:30.029 --> 14:31.493
And this is what he wants.

14:31.518 --> 14:33.648
What?!

14:35.549 --> 14:37.447
Well, this is great.

14:37.472 --> 14:39.206
My gummy hasn't kicked in,

14:39.231 --> 14:41.266
the concert is starting,
and we're stuck here

14:41.291 --> 14:43.201
on the side of the road
with this space cadet

14:43.226 --> 14:44.874
who is too high to drive.

14:45.828 --> 14:47.628
Hank, where are the keys?

14:47.668 --> 14:50.098
Have my hands always been this huge?

14:50.128 --> 14:52.468
I got Hulk-like hands up in here.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.417
I think I can lift this submarine.

14:55.466 --> 14:57.006
I'm doing it!

14:57.031 --> 14:58.655
It's not even that heavy.

14:59.378 --> 15:01.827
Did he just say submarine?

15:02.848 --> 15:03.848
Hi, fishy.

15:06.526 --> 15:09.291
Okay, I got this.
I'm gonna talk him down.

15:09.316 --> 15:10.556
Get those keys back.

15:10.688 --> 15:13.743
Back in the day, I guided John Belushi,

15:13.768 --> 15:15.838
Jimi Hendrix, and Jim Morrison through

15:15.863 --> 15:17.933
some pretty gnarly waters.

15:18.258 --> 15:20.228
Those people are all dead, Charlie.

15:20.268 --> 15:21.768
From drug overdoses.

15:26.668 --> 15:27.763
Hey, buddy.

15:28.168 --> 15:29.497
I'm the captain of this vessel.

15:29.522 --> 15:30.752
You will refer to me as "sir."

15:32.793 --> 15:34.178
Well, um...

15:34.208 --> 15:35.504
Here's the deal, sir.

15:36.248 --> 15:39.648
Um, you may have, through
no fault of your own,

15:39.678 --> 15:41.348
ingested some marijuana.

15:42.388 --> 15:44.518
But, luckily, I am here to help.

15:44.558 --> 15:47.719
And the submarine that you're
captaining is full of snacks.

15:47.945 --> 15:49.275
So if you want to feel better,

15:49.602 --> 15:51.470
- eat something.
- You sure?

15:51.810 --> 15:53.211
Can I get a depth reading, please?

15:53.918 --> 15:56.018
Hank, we promise, he's right.

15:56.043 --> 15:57.699
Eating is the ticket.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.051
- Okay, I'll eat the tickets.
- N-No!

15:59.075 --> 16:00.144
No, no, no, no.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.538
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

16:01.568 --> 16:04.908
You're right, I'm
feeling better already.

16:04.938 --> 16:07.748
Oh, no.

16:15.918 --> 16:17.518
There you are.

16:17.558 --> 16:20.021
I've been looking everywhere for you.

16:20.628 --> 16:23.075
Yeah, I came out here to calm down and

16:23.332 --> 16:25.032
dip my feet in the pool.

16:25.645 --> 16:27.427
But they asked me to take 'em out.

16:28.997 --> 16:30.247
Can we talk?

16:31.504 --> 16:32.786
This is all my fault.

16:33.188 --> 16:34.988
I should have been honest with you.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.483
And not hid behind John.

16:36.738 --> 16:39.425
But I don't want to hurt you anymore.

16:39.450 --> 16:42.698
I feel like I've
already ruined your life.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.668
Is that what you think?

16:46.887 --> 16:48.715
You didn't ruin my life.

16:49.379 --> 16:50.754
You made it great.

16:51.472 --> 16:53.222
You made me laugh every day

16:53.247 --> 16:55.117
and you gave me a perfect son.

16:56.714 --> 16:58.158
He is great.

16:58.198 --> 17:00.603
Thank you for getting me blackout drunk

17:00.628 --> 17:02.543
- all those years ago.
- Oh.

17:02.798 --> 17:05.079
Well, that's what wives are for.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.313
It makes me so sad that now

17:09.338 --> 17:10.808
you want me out of your life.

17:10.978 --> 17:13.308
No, I don't want that at all.

17:13.348 --> 17:16.248
I want you to be able to move on.

17:16.278 --> 17:19.578
You are a mega babe.

17:19.617 --> 17:22.547
You could still find that big love.

17:22.571 --> 17:24.541
I just don't want to stand in your way.

17:24.688 --> 17:27.458
And I don't want to
stand in your way, either.

17:27.866 --> 17:30.188
I mean, John is great. And,

17:30.228 --> 17:31.251
you know, I-I think...

17:31.828 --> 17:33.328
we really have been just, you know,

17:33.353 --> 17:35.329
a teensy bit codependent.

17:36.298 --> 17:38.247
Just because we're getting
a divorce doesn't mean

17:38.272 --> 17:40.712
that we won't always be family.

17:40.868 --> 17:43.268
I love you, Bonbon.

17:43.308 --> 17:44.708
Aw.

17:45.224 --> 17:46.380
Will you make me

17:46.612 --> 17:48.752
the happiest man in the world

17:48.777 --> 17:51.472
and become my ex-wife?

17:52.548 --> 17:54.118
I will.

17:54.148 --> 17:55.518
I will.

17:58.988 --> 18:00.558
Damn, girl!

18:00.588 --> 18:02.288
Whoo, those are lethal.

18:02.328 --> 18:04.698
You fogged me up.

18:07.217 --> 18:08.764
Well, I guess I'm not gonna get

18:08.789 --> 18:10.975
my sweater back from Christine McVie.

18:11.668 --> 18:13.758
I'm not gonna get to see Fleetwood Mac

18:13.783 --> 18:15.583
for the last time.

18:15.738 --> 18:19.138
Well, technically, you did
see them for the last time.

18:19.178 --> 18:20.708
The last time you saw them.

18:20.748 --> 18:24.418
You just didn't know that
was the last time, so...

18:24.448 --> 18:26.018
- This isn't helping, is it?
- No.

18:26.048 --> 18:28.058
It's not just the concert.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.236
Just, we're getting to
the point in our lives

18:30.261 --> 18:32.736
where there are gonna
be a lot of last times.

18:33.428 --> 18:35.189
I guess that's one way to look at it.

18:36.358 --> 18:38.358
Or you could look at it

18:38.398 --> 18:41.503
as tonight was a night of first times.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.065
First time we got Hank high.

18:45.096 --> 18:46.440
First time we bought

18:46.465 --> 18:48.393
a bunch of toilet paper together.

18:49.438 --> 18:51.463
Um, first time we missed a concert

18:51.488 --> 18:53.281
because Hank ate the tickets.

18:54.413 --> 18:57.038
You know, we're gonna have a
lot of first times together.

18:57.063 --> 18:58.070
Focus on that.

18:58.813 --> 19:01.023
I can't focus on anything right now.

19:01.048 --> 19:02.514
Oh, my speech blew your mind?

19:02.539 --> 19:05.217
No, my gummy just kicked in.

19:06.131 --> 19:07.499
Wowza.

19:07.524 --> 19:09.662
Charlie, Margaret.

19:09.686 --> 19:12.315
I found some of that
Fleetwood Mac on the radio.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.184
I finally get why you like that guy.

19:14.209 --> 19:17.079
Wait a minute. This isn't Fleetwood Mac.

19:17.104 --> 19:18.743
Oh, let him have it.

19:18.768 --> 19:20.579
âª We built this city âª

19:22.259 --> 19:23.978
âª We built this city on âª

19:24.008 --> 19:26.638
âª Fleetwood Mac! âª

19:26.678 --> 19:28.948
âª We built this city âª

19:28.978 --> 19:32.248
âª We built this city on rock and roll âª

19:32.278 --> 19:33.848
âª Built this city âª

19:35.418 --> 19:37.218
âª We built this city âª

19:37.248 --> 19:40.318

19:40.358 --> 19:42.158

âª We built this city âª

19:45.422 --> 19:47.322

19:47.347 --> 19:49.307

19:49.965 --> 19:51.865
âª We built this city âª

19:51.890 --> 19:54.408

19:54.438 --> 19:56.508

20:01.108 --> 20:03.248
âª Built this city. âª

20:04.046 --> 20:05.624
You take good care of my Sid.

20:05.649 --> 20:07.260
Oh, I will, I promise.

20:07.285 --> 20:08.755
And thank you for, you know,

20:09.260 --> 20:10.783
divorcing my boyfriend.

20:12.118 --> 20:16.158
Well, look at these dopeheads.

20:16.871 --> 20:19.373
Did y'all go a little cuckoo bananas?

20:19.398 --> 20:22.268
Well, I'm wearing a trash
bag, so I think you can guess.

20:22.298 --> 20:24.482
Oh, Margaret, I didn't notice.

20:24.507 --> 20:27.107
I thought for sure you
had worn that before.

20:29.408 --> 20:30.878
All right, everybody.

20:30.908 --> 20:32.501
I'm off to the airport.

20:32.939 --> 20:34.628
Oh, Sid, can you believe it?

20:35.394 --> 20:36.863
I'm a single lady now.

20:37.408 --> 20:39.518
Is that right?

20:39.548 --> 20:40.988
Well, if you need a ride,

20:41.018 --> 20:43.988
uh, I got a retirement
community rental van

20:44.018 --> 20:45.432
for another hour.

20:47.794 --> 20:49.590
No, I'm good.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.779
What if I told you
there's a 40-pound block

20:52.804 --> 20:54.051
of cheddar cheese in the back?

20:56.428 --> 20:58.086
I'll see you in the van.

21:03.508 --> 21:06.308
Sid, I love you. Mwah.

21:06.338 --> 21:07.908
- Goodbye, everybody.
- Bye.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.078
Is he okay to drive?

21:11.118 --> 21:13.048
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's sober now.

21:13.078 --> 21:15.148
Which will only make
the rejection harder.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.593
Poor Hank.

21:18.146 --> 21:21.546
Trying to please a woman
who's already had the best.

21:27.698 --> 21:29.211
Where is he going?

21:31.460 --> 21:32.460
That's pretty good.
