00:05.105 --> 00:06.846
Next, on Airwolf.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.784
My brother's still alive.

00:08.842 --> 00:13.018
Some guy rips off a cockamamie
copter, and you're going bananas.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.117
Sin Jin!

00:15.182 --> 00:16.684
String, get out of here!

00:16.750 --> 00:18.525
Your brother is missing in action.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.690
That's his MO. He grabbed that chopper.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.427
We will find the HX1,

00:22.489 --> 00:24.696
and when we do, we'll blow it to hell

00:24.758 --> 00:26.829
along with whoever is inside it.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

01:49.409 --> 01:52.015
Come on Dunkirk, truth.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.448
How much is in this for you?

02:08.095 --> 02:09.335
Now.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.995
Here you go.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.734
I said take the gun!

03:10.657 --> 03:12.136
Red alert.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.139
This is an alert. Condition red.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.606
I say again, condition red.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.443
We have a breach of security at the north end.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.250
I say again, condition red.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.487
Alert. This is an alert.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.328
Condition red.

04:18.425 --> 04:22.202
All I'm saying is, whoever pulled off
that raid knew his onions, all right.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.297
Coordinates.

04:23.363 --> 04:25.206
But that doesn't necessarily mean that…

04:25.265 --> 04:26.642
Coordinates, Dom.

04:28.468 --> 04:31.574
We'll start looking from the factory out again.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.611
Archangel said that the HX1 only had
enough fuel for a short flight.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.456
Sin Jin would have had a better plan than that.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.788
String, cut it out, will you?
You're driving me nuts.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.919
That's him. That bird's long gone. He did it.

04:44.851 --> 04:48.128
String, calm down and think
realistically, will you?

04:48.221 --> 04:51.134
Are you really trying to tell
me that your brother is alive

04:51.191 --> 04:53.296
after all these years?

04:53.660 --> 04:56.539
Not in a Vietcong prison,
but here in the States?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.435
This is his kind of job.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.409
You're hysterical.

05:00.934 --> 05:05.405
Some guy rips off a cockamamie
copter, and you're going bananas.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.745
They came in at zero power using auto-rotation.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.586
That's a technique we developed
in 'Nam for hitting Cong depots.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.216
There's only 4 guys who could pull it off

05:14.281 --> 05:16.158
without stuffing the chopper in the ground.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.959
Myself, Colonel Vidor,
Mace Taggart and Sin Jin.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.061
And Colonel Vidor is dead.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.929
So is Mace Taggart. I'm here.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.368
So who does that leave?

05:28.628 --> 05:29.971
Sin Jin.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.638
My brother's still alive.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.413
Move it, move it.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.852
Where's my brother?

05:52.219 --> 05:56.065
Sin Jin, Mace, where are you?
Give me your coordinates.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.602
My chopper went down
50 yards east of the river.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.194
String, what's hold’n up the program?

06:00.260 --> 06:02.672
Yeah, tell him we'd like to
go home. This dance is over.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.567
Roger. I read you. I'm almost in.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.653
I got you.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.802
See what happens when you ask for
waivers on brothers in the same unit?

06:31.858 --> 06:34.429
What can I do? He's afraid
to stay at home alone.

06:34.494 --> 06:35.564
No.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.009
Hit it! Come on, move it!

06:48.208 --> 06:49.380
Sin Jin!

06:49.442 --> 06:52.355
Sin Jin! Sin Jin! He's hit!

06:59.519 --> 07:01.089
Come on! Hit it!

07:01.688 --> 07:05.295
Go! Go! The ropes are full, Hawke.
We can't take any more.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.598
It's my brother!

07:06.660 --> 07:08.230
String, get out of here!

07:08.295 --> 07:09.638
Go on! Get!

07:09.729 --> 07:12.676
Sin Jin, Mace, you hang on. I'm coming back.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.148
Let's get out of here!

07:25.278 --> 07:27.815
I'm coming back. I swear to God, I am.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.553
We're approaching the factory again.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.893
What do you see?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.763
Same as before, noth’n.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.501
We've already covered all the
ground within HX1's fuel radius.

07:39.859 --> 07:43.466
One more pass, then I'm gonna phone
Archangel. That baby's nowhere.

07:43.863 --> 07:46.605
Don't bother, I'll see him myself.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.847
String, don't open up that hurt all over
again. You know what it does to you.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.578
Dom, you've always wanted
to be a Father to me,

07:53.640 --> 07:57.713
and I'm grateful, for a Father, not a Mother.

07:58.011 --> 08:01.515
String, think! After all these years

08:01.581 --> 08:03.788
your brother wouldn't be
running around like this

08:03.850 --> 08:07.423
without trying to contact you, now would he?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.958
That's what I intend to find out.

08:17.063 --> 08:21.603
Are you out of your mind? The Firm
was not involved in the Davsco raid.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.215
Yeah, just like you had
nothing to do with Airwolf.

08:24.270 --> 08:28.047
If we had the HX1, why would I
have every branch of the military,

08:28.108 --> 08:31.681
plus 30-odd fixed orbit satellites
searching for the damn thing,

08:31.745 --> 08:32.951
and then call you in?

08:33.013 --> 08:34.754
I don't care about HX1.

08:34.813 --> 08:37.658
Well, I do. That thing is one of a kind.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.230
Her avionics are revolutionary.
She can out-climb, out-maneuver,

08:41.287 --> 08:43.323
out-shoot anything else that flies.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.599
Pound for pound, she may even
be more deadly than Airwolf.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.696
That's how serious this thing is.

08:48.762 --> 08:51.675
What I care about is my brother, Sin Jin.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.209
Sin Jin? What's he got to do with this?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.805
Come on, Michael. He's here, isn't he?

08:57.904 --> 09:00.180
I don't know how you came
up with an idea like that.

09:00.240 --> 09:01.514
Isn't he?

09:01.574 --> 09:05.147
Your brother is missing
in action, MIA in Vietnam,

09:05.211 --> 09:08.556
and the Firm is still looking for
him. That's our deal, remember?

09:08.615 --> 09:09.821
You guys found him.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.660
You got some kind of hold on
him so he can't contact me.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.264
I think it might be better
if we took you off this one.

09:18.324 --> 09:21.328
Michael, that's his MO.
He grabbed that chopper.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.067
I'm gonna find it,

09:23.363 --> 09:25.343
and when I do, he'll be in the cockpit.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.777
Hawke, we can't have a weapon
like this on the loose.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.340
You worry about the weapons.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.406
I'm worried about my brother.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.682
What I'm saying is, we will find the HX1,

09:36.743 --> 09:40.657
and when we do, if there's just this
much chance of it leaving the country,

09:40.713 --> 09:44.058
we'll blow it to hell, along
with whoever is inside it.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.778
So? What’d I tell you? No satisfaction, right?

10:05.839 --> 10:08.479
Everything with Archangel's
like a Chinese puzzle.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.420
Look, let's say he is alive.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.049
How do you find a man
who doesn't wanna be found,

10:14.114 --> 10:16.788
or hasn't been found in all these years?

10:17.016 --> 10:21.158
Well, during the latter part of the
war, we did a lot of intelligence work,

10:21.621 --> 10:23.567
Mace, Sin Jin and I.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.535
Trouble is, some of the people we
worked with got to like it too much.

10:27.594 --> 10:31.508
Sure, they became mercenaries.
But Sin Jin wasn't that kind.

10:31.564 --> 10:35.068
He couldn't do it for money
any more than you could.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.444
Maybe he doesn't have any choice.

10:38.571 --> 10:42.212
Look, in order to find Sin Jin,
I'm gonna have to find HX1.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.687
That means I'm gonna have
to go back in the life.

10:45.745 --> 10:48.988
But String, that world is a sewer.

10:49.816 --> 10:54.196
What they steal and deal in
is wholesale misery and death.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.389
It'll be well worth it

10:56.456 --> 10:59.027
if finally, this time, I can pull Sin Jin out.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.950
Hey, Joe.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.149
What you been up to?

11:19.212 --> 11:22.159
This and that. You can see.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.526
Looking awful fat and sassy.

11:25.585 --> 11:26.620
I can't complain.

11:29.589 --> 11:33.503
That's a mighty nice weapon. You must
have some sheckles in your pocket.

11:34.727 --> 11:37.207
How come all the questions, Captain?

11:37.730 --> 11:40.006
Did you read about the HX1 raid?

11:40.066 --> 11:41.977
Wasn't that beautiful?

11:42.635 --> 11:45.479
You know, it kinda makes you
homesick for the old days.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.485
Tell you the truth, me and some of the
mercs had you pegged for the job,

11:48.541 --> 11:50.987
but I said, “Come on, be serious.”

11:51.277 --> 11:53.689
“Hawke's out of the dog's life.”

11:53.746 --> 11:56.454
“He's not studying war no more.”

11:58.751 --> 12:01.129
You know, it's an awful
lot like those operations

12:01.187 --> 12:03.531
Mace and my brother used to pull off.

12:03.590 --> 12:06.799
Yeah, except Mace is dead,
and your brother is too,

12:06.859 --> 12:09.135
or he might as well be.

12:09.195 --> 12:10.299
You know that?

12:10.363 --> 12:13.776
Hey Hawke, jeez! I mean, Mace's body was ID'd,

12:13.833 --> 12:16.177
and what was left of it was shipped back.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.547
And your brother? That poor guy's still MIA.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.814
What are you doing?

12:21.874 --> 12:24.684
I've got a feeling that Sin Jin's still alive.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.314
A real feeling.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.054
Tell your folks that.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.298
My folks are dead.

12:35.788 --> 12:37.358
See you around, Joe.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.334
Joe, we got a problem.

12:45.498 --> 12:46.977
Tell Dunkirk.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.863
Mace used to say,

13:11.224 --> 13:14.171
“Dad, you have twin sons. How about that?”

13:15.328 --> 13:17.399
“Me and my twin, Sin Jin.”

13:19.299 --> 13:21.245
Did he ever tell you that?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.705
Yes, sir, he did.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.043
You were their baby brother.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.288
Do you know where this was taken?

13:41.721 --> 13:43.064
Vung Tau?

13:43.122 --> 13:45.625
No, Ham Tan.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.372
Mace was a Captain by then.

13:51.531 --> 13:55.570
Frank and I know every step that
he took those last 2 weeks.

14:01.441 --> 14:06.413
Here is a motley crew of
stumblebums if I ever saw ‘em.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.006
Blood brothers to the end, huh kid?

14:23.062 --> 14:25.474
All the way, my man, all the way.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.108
Problem is, what do we do with him?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.036
Can't take him with us.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.446
How come?

14:32.105 --> 14:35.211
Because they sent him to us!

14:37.110 --> 14:38.180
Hey, come on.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.586
Give me a kiss. All right, all right.
Come on! No. Cut the love scene.

14:41.647 --> 14:44.491
Come on! Out! This is serious
art for posterity's sake.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.086
- For us soldiers! Hey!
- Smile.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.358
Bring it on.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.756
Gosh, how ugly.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.473
All right, I got it. I got it.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.911
Your brother was a fine man.

15:05.972 --> 15:08.009
He taught Mace all he knew.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.819
Yes.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.316
Mr. Taggart,

15:18.384 --> 15:22.457
have you read anything about a
break-in at the Davsco Aircraft plant?

15:23.456 --> 15:24.662
A break-in?

15:26.793 --> 15:30.331
There was a top-secret prototype.
Talk is it was stolen.

15:32.031 --> 15:33.476
Is that so?

15:35.034 --> 15:36.411
Well, the thing is,

15:38.237 --> 15:41.810
it was the same kind of operation
that this unit used to pull off.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.717
Well, what I'm asking is...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.722
- Get out.
- Mace did it.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.054
At last somebody else believes me.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.354
- Of course he can't be dead.
- Get out.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.452
My heart is still beating.
A Mother knows that.

15:51.517 --> 15:55.021
Our son is lying in Arlington,
in an honorable grave.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.665
Now, the United States Army
certified him killed in action,

15:59.725 --> 16:01.796
but you want to think that
he's still alive, don't you?

16:01.861 --> 16:04.671
Because you could've saved him, and you didn't.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.210
You could have saved your own
brother, and you didn't.

16:07.266 --> 16:08.768
That's why you came back here,

16:08.835 --> 16:11.372
because you wanna know
that you didn't let them die.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.782
Well, I am telling you that you did
let them die! You let them die!

16:16.976 --> 16:19.217
Please, please, no, no, no.
Don't stop. Don't stop.

16:19.278 --> 16:22.521
You find them both. There's a very good
reason why they haven't come forward.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.528
So when you see Mace, you tell him

16:24.584 --> 16:27.190
- that we will understand it!
- He is dead! He is dead!

16:27.553 --> 16:28.725
Dead!

16:29.922 --> 16:31.230
I'm sorry.

16:31.624 --> 16:37.370
Oh, God help us. Buried
forever, the both of them.

16:38.364 --> 16:40.742
So are 57,000 others.

16:41.434 --> 16:44.745
But not you. Not you!

16:59.886 --> 17:03.959
So, I said to her, “You're asking
me if my intentions are honorable?”

17:04.723 --> 17:08.797
“Baby, you know I'll be back after the war
to help you plow those rice paddies.”

17:12.131 --> 17:13.804
Here's to love.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.402
Hey, do you love me too, Mace?

17:15.468 --> 17:17.505
Oh baby, you know I love you,

17:19.238 --> 17:21.980
but you just gotta get rid
of this joker, Sin Jin.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.416
Mace, put me down.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.854
You guys had enough to drink,
why don't you just float away?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.830
Float? That's the Navy.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.692
Float.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.534
Do you love me?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.179
Do I love being alive?

17:52.939 --> 17:54.509
Don't say that.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.718
Ellie, I was just kidding.

17:57.777 --> 18:00.314
Okay, but not here, not about that.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.927
I'd love you at home.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.532
Jeez, I think I'm gonna be sick.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.094
I'm gonna be sick.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.602
So are we gonna get married and have kids?

18:15.661 --> 18:18.608
Yep, lots of kids.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.904
Lots of very beautiful kids.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.252
He likes you.

18:31.477 --> 18:33.821
So, are you still working for the Firm?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.554
She wants to know if I'm work’n for the Firm.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.523
Almost everybody knew it.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.327
We were that obvious, huh?

18:45.391 --> 18:48.964
Only to those who loved you
and worried about you.

18:55.167 --> 18:56.771
Not bad, homemade?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.615
Arthur made it.

18:59.672 --> 19:00.776
No kidding?

19:00.840 --> 19:04.447
No. No, as a matter of fact,

19:05.711 --> 19:07.554
Arthur made him, too.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.891
Pretty good, huh?

19:12.952 --> 19:14.761
Does he love you, Ellie?

19:16.422 --> 19:17.560
Yes.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.429
Good.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.502
Of course, being married to an accountant

19:26.565 --> 19:31.036
isn't exactly Saturday night in
Da Nang with Sin Jin Hawke.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.744
Well, at least you're happy.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.929
We had it all, he and I.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.237
You had more than that.

19:59.865 --> 20:03.540
My one night of folly
with Captain Mace Taggart.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.450
Boy, Ellie-girl, did you blow it.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.519
A lover's quarrel with Sin Jin Hawke,

20:13.746 --> 20:16.090
the guy you always dreamed of,

20:17.717 --> 20:21.597
then a one-night stand with Mace because
we had a fight and too much wine,

20:21.654 --> 20:22.689
and bingo!

20:23.989 --> 20:26.435
Our whole future's down the tubes.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.834
String, why in the hell are you
dragging him back into my life?

20:36.335 --> 20:38.406
Ellie. Ellie.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.447
He's not dead.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.381
Oh, String.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.616
I think he pulled off
that Davsco Aircraft raid.

20:47.113 --> 20:48.490
No.

20:49.148 --> 20:52.425
Dear God String, give yourself a break.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.398
He's gone. Accept it.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.169
Forget it.

21:01.026 --> 21:04.599
I mean, don't torture yourself
after all these years.

21:12.471 --> 21:14.542
That's Mr. 6:18.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.280
6:18?

21:16.342 --> 21:18.754
Arthur pulls into the driveway every day

21:18.811 --> 21:21.257
at exactly 6:18.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.021
Yeah, you can set your watch by him,

21:25.317 --> 21:26.921
and your life.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.363
Ellie, after you came back,

21:31.423 --> 21:33.664
did you ever think about Sin Jin?

21:33.726 --> 21:37.606
Like when you see a face
on a bus or at a ball park?

21:37.663 --> 21:40.143
No Hawke, never.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.045
Not once.

21:42.535 --> 21:46.005
Until now, you coming here.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.516
Hi, hon!

21:52.578 --> 21:55.422
I want you to meet an old friend.

21:58.784 --> 22:00.195
Can!

22:03.989 --> 22:05.059
That sucker's crazy.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.603
He's a crazy guy.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.298
You're soldiers of fortune.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.642
I happen to know your
fortunes are in the pits,

22:11.697 --> 22:14.109
so you can stand another war this year.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.942
Besides, the Persian Gulf's
a great place to visit.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.573
The food's fantastic as long
as you don't mind sand in it.

22:19.638 --> 22:22.141
- What's the pay?
- $200 a day,

22:22.208 --> 22:24.654
latest weapons, all the ammo you can eat.

22:24.710 --> 22:27.884
$200 a day, that's bandage money.

22:27.947 --> 22:28.982
Right, Hawke?

22:29.048 --> 22:31.722
Don't knock it. It's the only war in town.

22:33.619 --> 22:34.996
Hi, guys.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.791
Dunkirk, you still recruiting bodies?

22:37.857 --> 22:39.495
Man has to make a living.

22:39.558 --> 22:43.768
You still flying that souped-up Black
Maria you borrowed from the Firm?

22:45.030 --> 22:47.874
Just kidding, Hawke. You know I like to kid.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.412
Can!

22:52.738 --> 22:54.615
Long time no see, Hawke.

22:54.673 --> 22:56.118
I've been busy.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.519
Too busy to rap with old friends?

22:58.577 --> 23:00.056
You got a problem, Decker?

23:00.112 --> 23:01.455
Maybe you got a problem.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.618
What's up, Hawke? What you looking for?

23:03.682 --> 23:05.093
My brother.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.394
You're in the wrong country, old son.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.831
I mean, he's missing in
action over there, remember?

23:09.889 --> 23:13.268
Yeah, I heard a certain
helicopter pilot got the willies

23:13.325 --> 23:16.704
and then flew off and left
him for VC target practice.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.939
You have a big mouth, Max.
Now it's bleeding.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.079
Who asked him to come here?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.983
You know, you guys don't have the brains

23:30.042 --> 23:32.386
to have pulled off that raid without Sin Jin.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.118
You still have a touch of malaria, old son.

23:37.316 --> 23:40.388
When you see my brother,
tell him I'm looking for him.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.625
And you can write this down,

23:42.688 --> 23:44.361
I will find him.

23:50.496 --> 23:51.634
Can!

24:11.884 --> 24:14.228
You should’ve never come back.

24:27.733 --> 24:31.180
Seeing you again pal, gave me a taste.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.283
Give him to me, Decker.

24:44.783 --> 24:46.023
Get him good.

24:56.729 --> 24:58.572
Come on! Come on!

24:59.765 --> 25:00.835
You chicken!

25:24.656 --> 25:26.101
Sin Jin?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.272
Sin Jin?

25:43.575 --> 25:45.213
What's it gonna take, pal?

25:45.277 --> 25:46.984
Dom, I'm telling you, he's alive.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.889
Oh? You saw him?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.750
You saw somebody.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.193
I felt him.

25:52.418 --> 25:55.592
Sure, sure, just like
one of them ectoplasms

25:55.654 --> 25:57.964
or whatever it is you call them ghosts.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.035
Yeah, that's right.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.569
Yes, ma'am?

26:10.969 --> 26:12.277
Excuse me.

26:18.610 --> 26:22.057
So, this is where you work.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.489
Yeah, sometimes.

26:30.222 --> 26:33.533
Last month, Dunkirk came to see me.

26:34.760 --> 26:36.296
He wanted me to handle his books

26:36.361 --> 26:39.035
because he needed someone who he could trust.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.237
- Did you handle them?
- No.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.538
I'm through with that world, thanks.

26:43.602 --> 26:45.275
I really am, String.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.208
But Dunk offered me a lot of money.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.816
Did he say what he was up to?

26:55.047 --> 26:56.924
He's selling arms now,

26:57.616 --> 26:59.425
but not just guns.

26:59.651 --> 27:02.222
Rockets, tanks…

27:02.654 --> 27:03.928
Planes?

27:07.292 --> 27:09.135
Please be careful, String.

27:22.774 --> 27:24.276
Not bad.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.355
Are you properly impressed, chum?

27:28.413 --> 27:29.858
I'm more than impressed.

27:29.915 --> 27:33.692
I had no idea that recruiting
mercenaries paid so well.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.293
What do you want here, Hawke?

27:36.688 --> 27:37.928
The HX1.

27:39.124 --> 27:41.001
Now there's a bird.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.868
It should've been called Exterminator.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.465
Give me one of those babies, and
I'll clean house come Armageddon.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.737
Yeah, I bet you would.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.800
Hawke, if I had HX1,

27:48.867 --> 27:52.110
I'm not even sure if I'd trade
for that little honey of yours.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.082
Just look at the stats. Mind boggling.

27:54.139 --> 27:57.848
Speed, maneuverability, nuclear
capability and cheap as hell.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.453
A little death wagon with kill capacity

28:00.512 --> 28:02.856
of half our regular Air
Force at bargain prices.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.553
Come and get it!

28:05.350 --> 28:07.830
Uncle Michael, Uncle Michael, can I ride?

28:07.953 --> 28:10.399
Of course you can, darling,

28:10.856 --> 28:13.996
but you got to keep really quiet

28:14.059 --> 28:17.165
because Mr. Hawke and I are talking, all right?

28:17.429 --> 28:20.171
Now, here comes your horsie.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.711
We'll go on this one, shall we?

28:23.969 --> 28:25.175
Yes.

28:28.507 --> 28:30.851
Whoa! Not too fast.

28:36.882 --> 28:37.986
You were saying?

28:38.050 --> 28:40.155
How much are you getting for the HX1?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.823
I don't have it.

28:44.089 --> 28:47.969
You know, I don't approve
of recruiting men to kill,

28:48.460 --> 28:51.407
but that new chopper is wholesale slaughter.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.906
Defense.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.234
In the wrong hands…

28:55.300 --> 28:57.075
We've created another superpower.

28:57.135 --> 28:58.978
That doesn't bother you?

28:59.037 --> 29:00.948
Depends on the sale price.

29:01.006 --> 29:03.486
Heaven don't come cheap, you know.

29:06.011 --> 29:08.514
It would have bothered my brother.

29:08.714 --> 29:10.785
Let me tell you something, Hawke.

29:11.149 --> 29:14.187
You have a poison in you.
I didn't put it there.

29:14.253 --> 29:17.234
The mercenary life, for God and
country, you see a difference.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.166
That's the lie you live.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.903
To me a war is a war.

29:22.794 --> 29:26.173
God, I wish to hell your
brother was still around.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.370
I could use a man like him.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.173
Hawke won't let go. The man came to me,

31:13.238 --> 31:15.616
and there was nothing I
could say to turn him off.

31:15.674 --> 31:16.778
You want the truth?

31:16.842 --> 31:20.085
I don't wanna hurt the guy,
but he's getting too close.

31:20.145 --> 31:23.854
And if Armand hadn't held
us up, we'd be long gone.

31:23.915 --> 31:27.362
Instead, we're watching the clock
and seeing how long we can duck.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.490
We should've cut the bloody
bird up with torches

31:29.554 --> 31:30.965
and shipped it to Libya.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.023
Lighten up.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.867
Tomorrow we'll give Armand a show he
won't forget out at Red Rock Flats.

31:35.927 --> 31:38.430
Then we'll all retire to a Swiss lake.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.977
Don't even think about it.

31:51.042 --> 31:54.512
Put the gun down. There's a
good fellow. You're covered.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.823
I've heard that in all those old movies.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.893
Well, he's right, old buddy.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.593
Mace?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.928
Hello, laugh’n boy.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.008
You're still alive?

32:12.097 --> 32:14.008
And kick’n, old buddy.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.439
The VC didn't get you? You got away?

32:16.501 --> 32:18.777
Yeah, it wasn't for the lack of try’n.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.781
They've been tell’n me that Sin Jin's dead.

32:22.407 --> 32:23.647
He's not, is he?

32:23.708 --> 32:25.551
Why ask me, buddy boy?

32:25.610 --> 32:28.420
I'm the one you left behind
on that last trip, remember?

32:34.920 --> 32:37.764
He left us! He ran out and left us!

32:37.823 --> 32:39.234
He had to go.

32:41.026 --> 32:43.939
You never had to go. You always came back.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.537
Now Mace, pull it together, will you?

32:46.598 --> 32:49.511
You saw the ropes were full
on the rescue chopper.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.949
Come on. We gotta find some kinda cover.

33:08.353 --> 33:09.764
Let's go.

33:13.358 --> 33:17.829
I came back. I never left anybody
behind. You both were gone.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.637
It looked that way,

33:20.265 --> 33:22.802
but we managed to scrape through that one.

33:22.868 --> 33:24.814
So why'd you stay dead?

33:24.870 --> 33:28.682
All that nice white powder com’n
outta the golden triangle,

33:28.740 --> 33:31.186
everybody mak’n money but me.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.388
What about Sin Jin?

33:35.413 --> 33:37.154
He's here, isn't he?

33:37.215 --> 33:39.286
Is he part of this operation?

33:40.118 --> 33:41.358
Is he?

33:43.288 --> 33:44.995
Just tell me where the hell he is, Mace.

33:53.198 --> 33:56.577
Finish it. Come on, you said he deserted you.

34:13.451 --> 34:16.556
Come on, pick it up!
They're com’n over the hill!

34:20.926 --> 34:22.166
Sniper!

34:33.004 --> 34:35.074
That's another one I owe you.

34:47.217 --> 34:50.427
All right, cut the romance.
We gotta get outta here.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.137
Just dump him somewhere in the desert.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.072
He can't touch us now.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.218
Hey!

36:24.716 --> 36:25.990
Hey!

36:26.985 --> 36:28.328
Hey!

36:29.587 --> 36:30.793
Hey!

36:59.350 --> 37:00.658
Need help?

37:02.120 --> 37:03.827
Yeah, I'd appreciate it.

37:04.022 --> 37:06.298
This is a tough place to break down.

37:06.624 --> 37:08.968
It's a long walk to the nearest station.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.938
Where did you leave your car?

37:14.299 --> 37:17.143
What's the matter?

37:17.769 --> 37:19.146
Oh, God.

37:22.340 --> 37:23.944
What happened to you?

37:27.112 --> 37:28.887
What happened to you?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.287
No, I…

37:33.518 --> 37:35.122
lady, it's a long story.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.300
Come on, I gotta get you to a hospital.

37:37.355 --> 37:42.236
Can you just, please, get me to a telephone?

37:43.228 --> 37:44.298
Okay, come on.

38:01.679 --> 38:02.953
Thank you.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.492
Any time.

38:11.256 --> 38:13.793
You're sure you don't want a lift into town?

38:13.958 --> 38:15.460
No, thank you.

38:41.286 --> 38:45.792
Yeah, Operator, I'd like Santini
Air Services in Missoula Airport.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.402
Thank you.

39:23.394 --> 39:26.375
Red Rock Flats. You ever heard of it?

39:26.431 --> 39:28.104
East-southeast of Mineral Wells.

39:28.166 --> 39:30.578
I'll give you the exact location in 2 seconds.

39:38.810 --> 39:41.347
Most effective. Most effective.

39:41.412 --> 39:44.222
You can supply all these items in quantity?

39:44.282 --> 39:47.889
When I make a commitment, I
always follow through, old boy.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.931
What type of weapon is this?

39:50.989 --> 39:52.332
This will take out a tank, you say?

39:52.390 --> 39:56.930
M72A, 66 millimeter, anti-tank.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.140
Ah, beautiful.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.114
Beautiful.

40:11.175 --> 40:12.654
We ready for the main feature?

40:12.710 --> 40:13.916
All ready.

40:13.978 --> 40:15.286
Gentlemen.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.617
Got ‘em, String.

41:15.907 --> 41:17.181
Turbos.

41:27.685 --> 41:31.189
Nothing can touch HX1 this
side of Satan's 12 Valkyries,

41:31.255 --> 41:33.667
and she'd probably make
believers out of them, too.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.568
You're just a salesman, Dunkirk.

41:35.626 --> 41:38.698
How can we be certain
she'll perform as promised?

41:40.465 --> 41:42.069
Give us a show.

42:14.399 --> 42:15.935
Magnificent.

42:23.441 --> 42:25.250
Uninvited company.

42:36.921 --> 42:40.095
Mace, I want Sin Jin.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.035
If you got out, so did he. Where is he?

42:43.394 --> 42:44.805
What's happening?

42:44.862 --> 42:47.604
Gentlemen, you're about to see a demonstration

42:47.665 --> 42:52.671
of HX1's air-to-air capabilities
against the US government's finest.

42:52.737 --> 42:55.308
Mace, I know you can hear me. Answer me.

42:56.074 --> 42:57.951
Okay, buddy boy.

42:59.343 --> 43:00.651
I'll tell you this.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.089
I do know what happened to your brother.

43:03.181 --> 43:04.626
You just hold on.

43:04.682 --> 43:07.788
Hold on? For what? Where is he?

43:14.358 --> 43:16.099
Where is he, Mace?

43:26.971 --> 43:28.211
Mace, listen to me.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.913
You got trouble. I'll help you
out of it. I swear I will.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.384
There's your answer, String.

43:43.187 --> 43:45.861
Dom, he knows where Sin Jin is.

43:52.263 --> 43:54.072
Mace, please.

43:54.999 --> 43:57.138
String, fire back.

43:58.669 --> 44:02.173
Here you go, Hawke. Here's the
answer you've been wait’n for.

44:02.240 --> 44:03.480
Ready or not.

44:09.780 --> 44:13.318
String, he's gonna blow us out of the sky!

44:19.157 --> 44:21.398
She's hit. She's hit bad.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.494
Mace!

44:28.599 --> 44:30.078
Fire! Fire!

44:36.274 --> 44:37.344
String!

45:39.170 --> 45:42.583
We'll be okay, soon as I blow out this smoke.

45:47.245 --> 45:49.589
Yeah, right.

46:01.626 --> 46:04.971
What I'm trying to say
is that there's the past,

46:05.029 --> 46:06.667
and there's the future,

46:06.731 --> 46:08.472
and then there's today.

46:08.532 --> 46:09.977
You understand?

46:10.034 --> 46:13.675
And then there's the good times and…

46:13.738 --> 46:15.684
Dom, I'm all right.

46:16.240 --> 46:19.312
I'm not gonna stop looking
for Sin Jin, but I'm okay.

46:19.377 --> 46:21.414
What the hell, what I'm trying to say is…

46:21.479 --> 46:23.755
Mr. Santini, would you shut up, please?

46:23.814 --> 46:27.193
Is that there's no way to
say we know how you feel.

46:27.251 --> 46:28.423
So don't.

46:28.486 --> 46:29.658
Hawke, do you wanna know the truth?

46:29.720 --> 46:30.790
No.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.163
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell ya.

46:32.223 --> 46:34.066
Now, a piece of your life is gone,

46:34.125 --> 46:36.503
and you didn't find your
brother, but someday you will.

46:36.560 --> 46:37.595
Caitlin…

46:37.662 --> 46:39.369
Hawke, it's okay to feel badly,

46:39.430 --> 46:41.740
but just don't do it for too long,

46:42.300 --> 46:43.404
okay?

46:45.870 --> 46:47.406
- Okay?
- Okay.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.178
Okay, then let's get back to work.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.878
I gotta pay the bills, you know.

46:50.941 --> 46:52.352
You owe me a bill.

46:52.410 --> 46:53.445
What bill?

46:53.511 --> 46:56.287
You know, that $50 you bet me
I wouldn't change my hairdo.

46:56.347 --> 46:59.988
$50? I said that? I never said that.
