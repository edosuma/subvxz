[narrator]
<i>At the US Army's bionic testing facility,</i>

00:19.311 --> 00:23.607
<i>far beneath the modest hunting cabin

00:23.690 --> 00:25.234

00:25.442 --> 00:27.194
Okay, open the cabinet please.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.154
[narrator]
<i>...on the latest subject to receive</i>

00:29.238 --> 00:31.198
<i>a state-of-the-art robotic hand.</i>

00:31.406 --> 00:32.866
Oh.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.076
Too hard.

00:34.159 --> 00:35.702
I think that was too hard.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.080
[narrator]
<i>And although it wasn't a real home,</i>

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
<i>Buster had been left...</i>

00:39.665 --> 00:41.333
I can't take care of you anymore.

00:41.416 --> 00:42.543
[narrator]<i> ...with little alternative.</i>

00:42.626 --> 00:44.503
I need to get away, get away...

00:45.087 --> 00:46.838
You're hopelessly hopeless, Buster.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.132
It's as if they wrote that song
for my own son.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.050
Huh?

00:51.134 --> 00:53.262
Fine! I got my own family now.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.430
Army! And they want me.

00:55.681 --> 00:56.598
You guys want me, right?

00:56.723 --> 00:57.599
Oh, yeah.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.810
-[laughs]
-Once you learn how to use that thing,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.520
we're going to turn you
into a killing monster.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.397
Monster?

01:03.480 --> 01:04.856
[narrator]
<i>But before he could become one,</i>

01:04.940 --> 01:07.109
<i>he needed to master a few basics.</i>

01:08.110 --> 01:09.611
I got some on you.

01:09.778 --> 01:10.862
[narrator]<i> And the basics...</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:12.281
Yeah...

01:12.698 --> 01:13.991
you did get some on me.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.201
[narrator]<i> Seemed to be moving slowly.</i>

01:16.326 --> 01:17.869
[man] Yeah, that's on her.

01:17.953 --> 01:18.829
He got a little...

01:18.912 --> 01:20.080
It was too hard.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.582
[woman] I think it was as well.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.334
Let's go ahead and fast-forward
through the commercials.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.545
That's too fast. Okay, stop!

01:26.628 --> 01:28.755
There's Jon Cryer. Stop, that's Jon Cryer!

01:28.839 --> 01:31.550
[narrator]<i> But Buster wasn't in a hurry
<i>to leave his new family.</i></i>

01:31.633 --> 01:33.594
We're back
at the Progressive Insurance lady.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.846
I'm better off just watching
the commercials.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.973
-Don't say that.
-[grunts]

01:38.098 --> 01:39.516
[narrator]
<i>And behind the two-way mirror,</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:42.269
<i>the Army was rethinking
<i>its investment.</i></i>

01:42.352 --> 01:44.563
I hope this guy likes the music acts
on<i> Saturday Night Live,</i>

01:44.646 --> 01:46.815
because he's gonna be watching a lot
of them.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.942
[narrator]
<i>Now the story of what happened</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:52.696
<i>when the one man who was holding
<i>his family together</i></i>

01:53.196 --> 01:54.448
<i>finally let go,</i>

01:54.615 --> 01:57.743
<i>and the separate journeys
<i>that eventually gave them no choice,</i></i>

01:57.826 --> 01:59.369
<i>but to come back together.</i>

02:00.037 --> 02:03.248
<i>It's Arrested Development:
Fateful Consequences.</i>

02:06.001 --> 02:08.295
-[man] How many remotes do we have?
-[woman] That was the only one.

02:08.378 --> 02:10.881
[narrator]<i> As Buster was failing to adapt
<i>to a new life...</i></i>

02:10.964 --> 02:12.132
[man]
Do we have anybody from Pinky Team?

02:12.215 --> 02:13.425
<i>Guys, he can't do this.</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:16.386
[narrator] <i>...another Bluth family member
<i>was in another hospital</i></i>

02:16.470 --> 02:17.387
<i>embarking on one.</i>

02:17.554 --> 02:20.015
Lord, don't call this beautiful angel
home.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.100
[narrator]
<i>Tobias had recently met the woman</i>

02:22.184 --> 02:24.770
<i>at what he believed
<i>to be a method acting clinic,</i></i>

02:24.853 --> 02:27.314
<i>but was actually a methadone clinic.</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:28.982
Carl Weathers used
to give us grape juice.

02:29.066 --> 02:31.276
But then, he'd add $5 to our credit card.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.863
-Well, here is to our acting addiction.
-Yep.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.365
May we never be cured.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.701
[narrator]
<i>In fact, Debrie Bardeaux was an actress,</i>

02:39.785 --> 02:43.664
<i>having played the invisible woman,
<i>Sue Storm, 20 years earlier</i></i>

02:43.747 --> 02:46.541
<i>in the low-budget version
<i>of the Fantastic Four,</i></i>

02:47.125 --> 02:49.461
<i>produced by Imagine Entertainment.</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:51.588
<i>And Tobias was entranced.</i>

02:51.672 --> 02:53.548
What interesting friends we've made.

02:53.632 --> 02:57.761
[narrator] <i>And headed off to a food for
<i>stuff swapping restaurant with Lindsay,</i></i>

02:57.844 --> 03:00.055
<i>who was equally entranced...</i>

03:00.138 --> 03:01.848
A lot of people couldn't handle
a dumpster dive

03:01.932 --> 03:03.016
for their first double date.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.267
[narrator] <i>With Debrie's boyfriend.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:05.644
Is that what this is?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.437
No, Lindsay, we're together.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.398
[narrator] <i>But they wouldn't be for long,</i>

03:09.481 --> 03:11.108
<i>because after the methadone</i>

03:11.191 --> 03:14.027
<i>made DeBrie think
<i>she was a piece of toast...</i></i>

03:14.111 --> 03:14.986
DeBrie, that's our butter.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.488
We were gonna swap it for dessert.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.572
No, she's improvising.

03:17.656 --> 03:20.701
[narrator] <i>Tobias ended up connecting
<i>with her in the ladies room.</i></i>

03:20.784 --> 03:23.578
I see a pretty face under
all that butter substitute,

03:23.704 --> 03:25.539
and I recognize you from somewhere,

03:25.622 --> 03:27.749
but it's not the <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

03:27.833 --> 03:29.584
It's from somewhere else.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.545
I've done some things I'm not proud of.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.130
Episodics? Been there.

03:33.380 --> 03:36.383
[narrator] <i>She had been in a series
<i>of softcore porn movies</i></i>

03:36.466 --> 03:39.761
<i>about women leading straight men
<i>into gay sex,</i></i>

03:39.845 --> 03:41.012
<i>called Straight Bait.</i>

03:41.221 --> 03:43.557
He's gay. If you want to have sex with me,

03:43.640 --> 03:46.226
then you've got
to have sex with him first.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.186
And if you don't want
to have sex with her,

03:48.437 --> 03:50.439
-you must be gay.
-I'll show you how not gay I am.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.153
[narrator] <i>She did six of these movies.</i>

03:56.737 --> 03:58.905
<i>And after lunch, did three more.</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:00.824
It's nice to be recognized, though.

04:00.991 --> 04:04.745
Marky Bark, sometimes he doesn't know
when I'm in the same room.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.413
The same with me and Lindsay.

04:07.038 --> 04:07.873
Maybe she's right.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.792
I've yet to make more money as an actor
than I ever did as a doctor.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.462
And that's with Countrywide behind me.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.881
You're a doctor? You can write scrips?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.466
I like to think so.

04:17.549 --> 04:20.260
You seem like you'd
be a good doctor/actor.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.763
[narrator]
<i>It was the first positive reinforcement</i>

04:22.846 --> 04:24.723
<i>Tobias had had in ages.</i>

04:24.806 --> 04:26.516
You remind me of...

04:26.808 --> 04:27.851
Billy Crystal--

04:30.687 --> 04:32.606
[narrator]
<i>It would have broken Tobias' heart</i>

04:32.689 --> 04:37.068
<i>if he'd known she was about to say
<i>Billy Crystal Meth, a funny drug dealer.</i></i>

04:37.235 --> 04:38.487
I'm sorry, but Debrie,

04:38.570 --> 04:41.907
I've never met anyone
who understands me like you do.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.991
Or at all.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.744
Maybe with someone like you,
I could have a new start.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.997
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:49.539 --> 04:50.832
Did you see my license plate?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.918
A-N-U-S-T-A-R-T?

04:53.043 --> 04:55.504
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:55.587 --> 04:59.299
Did you see my <i>Straight Bait movie
of the same name?</i>

05:01.009 --> 05:03.845
We should be together, we should run away.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.807
[stammers] Oh, my gosh. Whoa!

05:07.307 --> 05:08.266
This is happening so fast.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.185
What do I do about Lindsay?

05:10.268 --> 05:12.521
Can I just improv my way out
of a marriage?

05:14.564 --> 05:17.108
Yes, and let's do this.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.235
Blackout.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.155
"And scene," as they say.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.491
Her heart stopped. She's dying!
Please, someone.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.034
She had too much butter.

05:26.117 --> 05:27.744
She's a very famous actress.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.287
Oh, my God, that's a butter face.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.497
How much butter did the patient have?

05:30.580 --> 05:32.958
I don't know,
a <i>Star Trek chess set's worth?</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:35.043
That Swappigans puts more people
in this hospital...

05:35.126 --> 05:37.128
Make way, people.
We got a 61-year-old male

05:37.212 --> 05:38.672
in full cardiac arrest coming through.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.589
You have to wait outside, sir.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.132
Be careful of her face.

05:41.216 --> 05:44.135
She's an actress. [wailing]

05:44.219 --> 05:47.389
[narrator] <i>It's worth noting
<i>he'd heard this Orange County hospital</i></i>

05:50.350 --> 05:51.518
<i>seeking plastic surgery.</i>

05:51.601 --> 05:55.939
We're both actors. [wails]

06:02.571 --> 06:03.446
Please let her live.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.825
If you do, I promise I will devote all
of my acting talents to you.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.870
[narrator] <i>And putting out some feelers

06:09.953 --> 06:12.289
I'll even keep working
in religious programming

06:12.789 --> 06:15.333
For less than scale--
for Christian scale, as it were.

06:15.584 --> 06:18.169
[narrator] <i>Of course, he was referring

I'm gonna be there tonight
about eight,

-Obviously, it's me your fa--
-[beeps]

07:02.505 --> 07:03.340
I got it.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.299
Okay.

[narrator] <i>But the prayers made</i>

Makeup makes everyone

07:11.973 --> 07:14.893
You didn't leave me. Everybody leaves me.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.561
I wouldn't dream of it.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.272
Excuse me, could you leave us?

07:19.356 --> 07:20.357
-Absolutely.
-Thank you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.984
No, I'd like him to stay.

07:23.068 --> 07:23.944
Really?

07:24.027 --> 07:25.028
-Yeah.
-Okay.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.031
I'm afraid that you have tested positive
for chlamydia, syphilis,

07:28.114 --> 07:31.034
gonorrhea, hepatitis, pancreatitis,
trichomoniasis,

07:31.242 --> 07:32.744
non-gonococcal urethritis.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.537
all the "itis-es," really.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.040
And there's also a host of "osis-es."

07:37.374 --> 07:39.209
You know, what this means,
in non-medical terms,

07:39.292 --> 07:41.628
is that you have landed a real party girl.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.881
[Tobias] Will she be okay?

07:44.965 --> 07:48.009
We can treat all of these things,
but if she's really gonna be okay...

07:48.385 --> 07:50.303
she's going to have to tackle
this drug problem.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.430
You didn't tell me you had a drug problem.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.516
We met at a methadone clinic.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.726
Are you high, we met at an acting class.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.269
The Method One...

07:59.396 --> 08:01.356
I'm going to let you guys hash this out.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.608
I guess I shouldn't have lied
about being clean

08:03.692 --> 08:04.943
when I took that methadone,

08:05.151 --> 08:06.569
but I'll do better this time.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.446
Are you going to leave me
now that you know

08:08.530 --> 08:10.031
that I'm a druggie?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.576
DeBrie look, you are a gifted actress.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.453
When I first saw <i>Straight Bait,</i>

08:15.537 --> 08:18.873
there were two men making love,
but I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.291
You watched <i>Straight Bait?</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:21.751
Oh just 2, 4 and 9.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.504
You were with a guy
who didn't care about you,

08:24.796 --> 08:27.549
but stick with me,
and I'll make you famous,

08:27.716 --> 08:29.217
then you won't need any drugs.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.428
Well, you're a doctor,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.596
you could get me signed out of here.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.433
So I can pursue my dream of acting?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.520
Of course I can.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.606
[narrator] <i>But while Tobias was trying
<i>to sneak out of a hospital,</i></i>

Ah! I blew it again.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.405
I'll never do it right.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.451
[narrator] <i>And the Army began to suspect

09:02.417 --> 09:04.085
<i>Maybe it would work with ice cream.</i>

09:04.627 --> 09:05.628
Now he wants ice cream.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.756
He's using us.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.883
It might be time for the Q test.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.427
The Q test? What's a Q test?

09:12.844 --> 09:15.847
[narrator] <i>Gob was planning

-It was like I hit--
-Rock bottom?

09:26.316 --> 09:27.150
No, not that.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.778
More like a trending downward moment.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.406
Maybe I'm being tested,
like that guy "Job" from the Bible.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.575
-Job. Job!
-Yes?

09:35.658 --> 09:36.493
Yes, sir.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.828
-Job.
-Yeah, that's me.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.121
I feel sorry for you, Pops.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.207
Hey, pal.
I'm not that much older than you, guy.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.416
[laughs]

Nah, I'm just here looking for my son,

You have another son?

09:50.882 --> 09:54.344

Yes... Steve.

-What's his name?
-Dave.

10:01.059 --> 10:01.976
Dave Holt!

-Your mom's name is Eve?
-Yeah.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.527
I [bleeps] a chick named Eve once.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.487
Biggest mistake of my life.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.322
[narrator]
<i>And perhaps, it was because Gob</i>

Would you want to come work with me?

10:21.913 --> 10:22.747
Are you serious?

10:22.831 --> 10:24.582
I'm in pest control, but...

10:24.666 --> 10:26.251
Father and son?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.002
What a great team.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.504
It would be a great team.

10:29.838 --> 10:32.257
But I don't... pest control. I don't know.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.301
As long as I'm not being a pest to you,
right? I'm kidding.

10:39.597 --> 10:41.349

-One, eight, one...
-One, eight, one...

-Manville.
-Manville.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.147
Manville.

10:47.230 --> 10:49.983

10:50.108 --> 10:51.276
Seven a.m.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.863

11:19.888 --> 11:21.973

11:23.308 --> 11:24.517
[man] Why wouldn't be able to see us?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.477
Because it's a mirror.

No, it's a window.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.858
[Buster] All right.

Okay, let's take it down.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.163
Mark Cherry, the baby-faced singer,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.291
Baby-faced singer.

[narrator]  <i>...before she was ready.</i>

14:33.122 --> 14:34.749
Okay, let's go back to something

14:34.832 --> 14:36.084
you're more comfortable with.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.711
We should resurrect
your most famous character,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.171
Sue Storm.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.590
We're gonna do
the <i>Fantastic Four movie.</i>

14:42.715 --> 14:45.259
Well, I don't know about just yet, but...

14:46.427 --> 14:48.262
DeBrie, if you make this leap with me,

14:48.554 --> 14:51.724
I promise I'll have you splattered all
over Hollywood Boulevard.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.434
How does that sound?

14:54.102 --> 14:55.395
Confusing.

14:56.020 --> 14:56.854
[narrator] <i>It was.</i>

14:57.188 --> 15:00.983
Get your photo taken with Sue Storm,

Is that Jessica Alba?

15:02.777 --> 15:04.320
No, this is the original Sue Storm,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.489
-DeBrie Bardeaux
-Who?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.449
The original Sue Storm, DeBrie Bardeaux.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.827
No, no free pictures, kids. No, no!

15:10.910 --> 15:13.079
Scram, get out of here.<i>Go! Go!
Get out of here.</i>

15:13.162 --> 15:14.747
I don't think this is working.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.458
I need to get a regular job.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.627
I do have a law degree.

15:19.710 --> 15:23.131
I know, and I'm a doctor,
but, no, let's not settle.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.341
It's the Fantastic Four.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.760
No one recognizes one alone.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.556
$10 gets you a picture
with real Hollywood characters.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.808
What do you say, $10?
That's certainly cheap.

15:33.933 --> 15:37.395
Hello, young man and his... uncle?

15:37.478 --> 15:38.312
Neighbor?

15:38.896 --> 15:39.730
Father.

15:39.814 --> 15:40.940
Oh, that's terrific.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.067
I'm Johnny Storm, the human flamer,

15:43.151 --> 15:45.153
and this is Sue Storm, my sister

15:45.236 --> 15:46.946

15:47.029 --> 15:48.322
Now watch as I get--

15:48.406 --> 15:52.034
I have special effects.
Look, children love fire. [groans]

15:52.118 --> 15:53.661
This isn't working either.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.745
[sighs] You're right.

15:54.829 --> 15:57.039
Two people in blue
doesn't say <i>Fantastic Four.</i>

15:57.999 --> 15:58.875
You know what, though.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.502
I think I may have just the thing.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.172
Just "The Thing."

16:04.881 --> 16:05.715
Cut to...

16:05.798 --> 16:08.426
Now that I'm the iconic rock man
The Thing,

16:08.509 --> 16:09.927
no one will misunderstand.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.597
I'm sure the Blues Brothers here
will know who we are.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.515
Excuse me, are you Sue Storm
and The Thing?

16:14.599 --> 16:16.434

-No, DeBrie, I've got this.

What am I supposed to do?

16:52.386 --> 16:53.721
I have nowhere to live.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.307
You should have thought about that

Oh, I'm sorry.
I have nowhere to go.

What do you see when you look at this?

17:17.995 --> 17:21.249
I see a veteran whose hand I'd like

Not that one.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.335
You're under arrest.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.253
What?

18:07.420 --> 18:08.838
Boom. Turn around. Let's go.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.799
-I didn't--
-Let's go. Get up there. Come on.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.385
If it happens again,
it will be a third strike.

18:14.468 --> 18:16.554
The three strikes law is up for review
in the appellate courts,

18:16.637 --> 18:18.472
but we really shouldn't be charging.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.100
I know of a street in Garden Grove
where they don't police very much.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.018
Okay.

I missed you out there.

DeBrie, what are you doing?

19:40.054 --> 19:41.138
We're broke.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.724
But you can't sell
your <i>Fantastic Four costume.</i>

19:43.808 --> 19:45.851
No, I was gonna have sex with him.

He's a vet, Herbert.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.918
