29:49.091 --> 29:50.484
death.

29:50.527 --> 29:53.008
I'm starting to regret
this idea already.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.839
Well, the Phoenix will support
whatever you decide.

30:04.106 --> 30:06.239
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

30:07.153 --> 30:08.719
I got a question.

30:08.763 --> 30:11.461
So both of you guys know about
the escape hatch in this house

30:11.505 --> 30:13.028
and just left me in the dark
all these years?

30:13.072 --> 30:14.247
BOZER:Uh...

30:14.290 --> 30:15.726
Ooh.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.511
Give it up!
If it makes you
feel any better,

30:17.554 --> 30:18.904
I completely
forgot about it.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.644
[chuckles]
I didn't.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.646
I remember the first time you
almost used it when The Ghost

30:22.690 --> 30:24.648
rigged the house to blow
with you and Jack inside.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.389
Oh, yeah,RILEY:Well, thank God
you didn't.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.130
This place would have
been a pile of ashes.

30:28.174 --> 30:29.784
MacGYVER:
We've faced a lot
of psychopaths over the years.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.439
Mm-hmm.Helman, Murdoc...

30:32.482 --> 30:34.180
The Ghost.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.877
Don't forget Mason.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.009
DESI:
Teague,

30:37.052 --> 30:38.749
General Ma, Silas.BOZER:Leland,

30:38.793 --> 30:39.707
the Merchant.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.361
Basically,
all the Codex nutbags.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.667
MacGYVER:
And after all the enemies
that we've faced,

30:43.711 --> 30:47.062
I never imagined it would be
something microscopic

30:47.106 --> 30:49.021
that might actually kill me.

30:49.064 --> 30:51.501
Kill us.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.117
I want to go first, Riley,

30:58.160 --> 30:59.596
in the hyperbaric
chamber.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.860
I want to test the side effects
before you do.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.256
No way.

31:07.300 --> 31:10.781
If we're gonna do it, we gotta
do it the way we always have:

31:10.825 --> 31:12.305
together.

31:13.741 --> 31:16.048
So you've both decided
to go through with it?

31:17.049 --> 31:18.572
[sighs]

31:19.312 --> 31:20.530
I know it's scary.

31:20.574 --> 31:22.010
I need to know that
you'll be there.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.098
Will you help us?

31:23.142 --> 31:26.145
Yeah. I'll be there.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.711
No matter
what happens.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.718
MacGYVER:
Boze,

31:34.762 --> 31:37.069
I need to know
you'll be there by my side.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.723
Brothers for life.

31:39.767 --> 31:40.507
[exhales]

31:40.550 --> 31:41.943
Brothers for life.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.249
Yeah.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.946
MacGYVER:
When facing a risky procedure

31:44.990 --> 31:47.731
where your body could undergo
oxygen toxicity,

31:47.775 --> 31:51.257
it's important to not
lose touch with what matters.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.694
Ensuring communication
with those you love

31:53.737 --> 31:54.956
most in the world.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.479
That's for you.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.481
Hyperbaric chambers act
like a Faraday cage.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.527
You can't use radio waves,

32:00.570 --> 32:02.224
so I rigged
these walkie-talkies

32:02.268 --> 32:05.488
so that we can be
in constant communication.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.404
Hey, Boze?
Yeah.

32:09.405 --> 32:12.191
This is gonna work,
and when it does,

32:12.234 --> 32:13.496
you can give this back to me.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.759
Yeah.

32:19.024 --> 32:19.981
All good to go.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.375
Mac?

32:25.291 --> 32:27.032
MacGYVER: All right,
let's do this.

32:37.564 --> 32:39.087
SANDRIA:
Increasing the pressure

32:39.131 --> 32:40.784
to 2.8 atmospheres.DESI:
How long do they have

32:40.828 --> 32:42.351
to be exposed
to this level of pressure?

32:42.395 --> 32:43.918
Depends. Treatments can last

32:43.962 --> 32:45.920
from two minutes to two hours.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.796
2.1 atmosphere.

32:54.929 --> 32:56.975
2.4 atmospheres.

33:00.326 --> 33:02.719
This better or worse

33:02.763 --> 33:05.766
than being trapped in a
sarcophagus with Jack in Cairo?

33:07.202 --> 33:09.161
[sighs] Well...

33:09.204 --> 33:11.206
I would say it's, um...

33:11.250 --> 33:12.947
pretty much on par.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.732
But the company is far better.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.084
[rapid beeping]

33:20.085 --> 33:21.521
It's working.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.093
SANDRIA:
Good news, Riley.

33:28.136 --> 33:30.573
Your nanobots have
started deteriorating.

33:33.228 --> 33:34.838
Riley?

33:34.882 --> 33:38.233
You are officially clear
of the nanobots.

33:38.277 --> 33:40.105
[cheering, applause]

33:46.763 --> 33:49.462
Dialing back Riley's pressure
to normal.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.728
Mac's nanobot count
hasn't moved.

33:57.557 --> 34:01.300
Hey, cutie.
Time to kick this thing.

34:01.343 --> 34:04.129
MacGYVER:
Hey, uh, Dr. Sandria?

34:04.172 --> 34:06.827
Is it possible
to up the atmospheres?

34:06.870 --> 34:09.438
Pressure puts you at risk
for lung, ear and brain damage.

34:09.482 --> 34:12.093
Few minutes. I mean, if they're
anything like Riley's,

34:12.137 --> 34:13.747
then we hit
the right amount of pressure

34:13.790 --> 34:15.096
and, uh,
they'll deteriorate quickly.

34:15.140 --> 34:16.619
Plus, I run
the same amount of risk

34:16.663 --> 34:18.926
being in here longer anyways.

34:21.233 --> 34:23.887
Well, it's worth a try.

34:25.150 --> 34:27.717
Dr. Sandria, go ahead.

34:27.761 --> 34:30.633
Increasing to 3.5 atmospheres.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.204
You're over 120 feet deep now,

34:36.248 --> 34:37.205
Mac.

34:37.249 --> 34:38.467
Come on, Mac.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.208
You can do this.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.862
Come on, Mac.

34:42.689 --> 34:44.647
And we have
a decline.

34:44.691 --> 34:47.172
[rapid beeping]

34:52.394 --> 34:53.700
Something's wrong
with Mac!

34:58.531 --> 35:01.708
Mac! Mac! Mac!

35:01.751 --> 35:03.449
Mac, can you hear me?!

35:03.492 --> 35:06.060
BOZER:
Mac! Mac, wake up!

35:06.104 --> 35:08.497
[flatline droning]MATTY: No, no, no, no! Mac!

35:08.541 --> 35:09.759
Get him out of there right now!

35:09.803 --> 35:11.326
Dialing back
to 2.8 atmospheres.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.675
Well, we got to do something!MATTY: Get him out of there!

35:12.719 --> 35:13.676
If the pressure change
is too fast,

35:13.720 --> 35:15.287
we risk decompression sickness

35:15.330 --> 35:17.332
and we won't be able
to resuscitate him.We're losing him!

35:17.376 --> 35:18.899
Mac!Let him out!

35:18.942 --> 35:22.250
Mac! Taylor,
get me out, get me out.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.512
Unlock it!

35:23.556 --> 35:24.818
BOZER:
Mac!

35:24.861 --> 35:26.689

35:33.479 --> 35:35.133
Don't leave me.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.395
1.8 atmospheres.

35:36.438 --> 35:37.700
Not like this.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.923
RILEY [echoing]:
Don't leave me...

35:52.454 --> 35:54.326
RILEY:
Mac? Mac?

35:54.369 --> 35:56.371
Mac?

35:56.415 --> 35:58.068
Mac?[monitor beeping slowly]

35:58.112 --> 35:59.722
MATTY:
He's breathing.

35:59.766 --> 36:02.116
SANDRIA:
Let's get him out of there.

36:12.822 --> 36:15.434
Is there brain damage?

36:15.477 --> 36:17.392
Is he gonna he remember us?

36:17.436 --> 36:20.743
We won't know
until he regains consciousness.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.160
[MacGyver grunting]

36:53.559 --> 36:55.300
Did it work?

36:56.518 --> 36:58.781
Are we nanobot-free?

36:59.826 --> 37:02.132
We're nanobot-free, Mac.

37:05.875 --> 37:07.355
It's about time.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.792
Welcome back.

37:17.496 --> 37:20.325
Don't ever scare me
like that again, man.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.509
MATTY:
Watching you flatline,

37:30.552 --> 37:33.425
I can't shake that.

37:33.468 --> 37:36.079
I can only imagine.

37:36.123 --> 37:38.821
Literally, because I have
no memory of it.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.736
Probably better that way.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.651
Mac, you were dead for seconds,

37:42.695 --> 37:45.001
but it felt like an eternity.

37:45.045 --> 37:47.482
I guess it just wasn't my time.

37:47.526 --> 37:50.137
Thank God for that.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.663
[exhales]

37:54.707 --> 37:57.362
Matty, I've been thinking a lot.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.974
I don't think
I can do this anymore.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.106
Mac, you have been through
so much.

38:03.150 --> 38:05.413
I think that you should take
some time off

38:05.457 --> 38:06.675
before you make
any rash decisions.

38:06.719 --> 38:09.025
This isn't rash. I was abducted,

38:09.069 --> 38:11.245
experimented on
and I had my memory wiped.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.987
And the government that I've
been serving for over a decade,

38:14.030 --> 38:16.337
in the Army
and here at the Phoenix,

38:16.381 --> 38:17.860
they knew.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.775
They didn't just know,
they funded the research.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.342
I'm just as shocked regarding

38:21.386 --> 38:23.344
the government's involvement
as you are.

38:23.388 --> 38:24.911
Do you want to know the crazy
thing about all of this?

38:24.954 --> 38:26.434
If they had just asked
for volunteers

38:26.478 --> 38:28.741
to track the benefits
of nanotechnology,

38:28.784 --> 38:30.525
I would've signed up.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.788
In the name of science.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.706
But to do this,
to use us as guinea pigs,

38:37.750 --> 38:40.056
without our consent,
it's disgusting.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.710
I agree and I understand.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.886
But the work that we do
at the Phoenix, it's different.

38:43.930 --> 38:45.018
MacGYVER:
Not if they control the intel

38:45.061 --> 38:47.237
and the purse strings.

38:47.281 --> 38:48.891
[sighs]

38:48.935 --> 38:50.893
We'll figure something out.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.156
I already have.

38:57.117 --> 38:59.032
MATTY:
Thank you all
for coming back in.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.339
TAYLOR:
Uh, there is an announcement.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.993
One that couldn't wait.

39:05.038 --> 39:06.779
You all mean
the world to me.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.389
And there's nothing
I'm more proud of

39:08.433 --> 39:10.957
than the work
we've done here at the Phoenix.

39:12.567 --> 39:13.916
But...

39:13.960 --> 39:15.614
given the discovery
that the government

39:15.657 --> 39:17.572
was behind our kidnapping

39:17.616 --> 39:20.575
and experiments and turned
a blind eye to thousands

39:20.619 --> 39:22.447
of servicemen and women...

39:22.490 --> 39:24.187
and their families.

39:24.231 --> 39:26.755
And much of what
we do here,

39:26.799 --> 39:29.410
albeit rewarding work,

39:29.454 --> 39:31.891
it's overseen

39:31.934 --> 39:34.372
and funded
by the U.S. government.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.114
[sighs]
A government which I can

39:38.158 --> 39:40.378
no longer serve
in this official capacity.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.207
What are you saying?

39:47.646 --> 39:49.952
Today's my last day.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.396
You're the one that brought me
into the Phoenix.

39:59.353 --> 40:02.312
If you're hanging up your comms,

40:02.356 --> 40:04.358
so am I.

40:05.490 --> 40:06.969
DESI:Me, too.

40:07.013 --> 40:09.189
There's many more ways
to serve our country.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.453
You sprung me out of prison and
my life's never been the same.

40:12.497 --> 40:14.890
So... I'm out, too.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.415
[chuckles softly]

40:18.807 --> 40:21.027
MacGYVER:
Taylor, Matty,

40:21.070 --> 40:22.376
I apologize.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.030
I didn't think
this was gonna happen.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.727
TAYLOR:
No need to apologize.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.337
We just, uh,

40:27.381 --> 40:29.688
wanted to make sure
you would, um,

40:29.731 --> 40:31.341
consider all your options.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.866
MATTY:
Before you quit,
we thought you should know.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.085
Taylor and I have decided to cut

40:36.129 --> 40:38.261
all government ties.

40:38.305 --> 40:42.004
The Phoenix is
now fully autonomous.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.224
From now on,
no more government contracts.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.836
We'll only take on missions
of our choosing.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.403
[MacGyver chuckles]

40:49.447 --> 40:50.839
Can you do that?

40:50.883 --> 40:52.362
I mean, financially?

40:52.406 --> 40:55.365
Well, when you have
as much money as, as I do...

40:55.409 --> 40:56.715
[chuckles]

40:56.758 --> 40:58.456
...one can do...

40:58.499 --> 41:01.023
whatever they damn well please.

41:09.118 --> 41:10.729
If you are in...

41:10.772 --> 41:13.732
I hope you'll join me

41:13.775 --> 41:15.473
in a toast.
Here's to...

41:15.516 --> 41:18.519
the next chapter of our work
here at the Phoenix.

41:18.563 --> 41:21.435
From now on,
it's us against the world.

41:28.573 --> 41:31.010
Doing whatever
we damn well please.

41:32.838 --> 41:35.318
And having each
other's back.

41:37.103 --> 41:40.106
Because that's what family does.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.162
You're right.

41:53.946 --> 41:56.514
We have each other and that's
all we've ever needed.
