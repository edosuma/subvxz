[Helen]
<i>Are you living with her?</i>

00:10.096 --> 00:11.479
[Noah]
<i>No, Helen, I'm not.</i>

00:11.514 --> 00:13.147
I don't want her
anywhere near my kids.

00:13.182 --> 00:15.066
Well, you might not get to have
everything you want, Helen.

00:15.101 --> 00:16.650
I saw this in a shop window,

00:16.686 --> 00:18.436
and I thought how beautiful
it would look on your finger.

00:18.438 --> 00:19.837
Yes, I want to marry you.

00:19.872 --> 00:21.822
- Whitney.
- What's <i> she</i> doing here?

00:21.858 --> 00:23.240
I thought
you weren't living together.

00:23.276 --> 00:24.642
You have a family.

00:24.677 --> 00:26.110
- Take off the ring, bitch!
- Just stop!

00:26.112 --> 00:27.778
- Take the fucking...
- Stop that! Stop it!

00:27.830 --> 00:29.613
[Alison] <i> Do you think</i>
<i>we're making a mistake?</i>

00:29.665 --> 00:31.282
My whole life
I've been afraid of what

00:31.284 --> 00:32.783
other people think of me,
and I'm done.

00:32.785 --> 00:35.186
It's a pot lozenge.
For later.

00:35.221 --> 00:37.588
She can't know
I'm living with Alison.

00:37.623 --> 00:39.040
Don't worry, Dad.
I got you.

00:39.092 --> 00:41.792
I am sending an email
to my accountant

00:41.794 --> 00:44.128
and telling him
to send you $50,000.

00:44.130 --> 00:45.463
I don't want to take
any more money off you.

00:45.465 --> 00:46.630
Noah, take it.

00:46.682 --> 00:48.182
The sooner you and Helen
get divorced,

00:48.217 --> 00:49.867
the happier
everyone will be.

00:49.902 --> 00:52.636

<i>On Saturday, May 9th,</i>

02:11.818 --> 02:14.852
<i>Noah Solloway returned
to his wife and family</i>

02:14.887 --> 02:19.623
expressing regret and dismay
over his recent betrayal

02:19.659 --> 02:23.060
and asserted his wish
to rebuild their...

02:23.112 --> 02:25.629
Previously happy...
Life together.

02:25.665 --> 02:27.898
The very next day,
May 10th...

02:27.950 --> 02:31.068
After an unfortunate incident
in which the husband

02:31.070 --> 02:33.737
of his paramour
pulled out a gun

02:33.739 --> 02:37.208
right in front
of his 17-year-old daughter,

02:37.243 --> 02:41.078
Mr. Solloway returned
abruptly, impulsively,

02:41.113 --> 02:44.982
right back into the arms
of said paramour.

02:45.017 --> 02:47.484
He has done nothing
but lie to, neglect,

02:47.520 --> 02:49.453
and traumatize my client

02:49.488 --> 02:51.755
and her four children
ever since.

02:51.757 --> 02:56.160
Mr. Solloway has opted
to live in a single-room cabin

02:56.195 --> 02:58.596
some 60 miles
outside of the city.

02:58.631 --> 03:01.465
60?
You said six-zero?

03:01.500 --> 03:03.834
I did, Your Honor.
That's correct. Six-zero.

03:03.870 --> 03:06.103
Way up the Hudson in...
What is it?

03:06.155 --> 03:07.838
Cold Spring, New York.

03:07.874 --> 03:09.306
Which is just temporary,
Your Honor.

03:09.342 --> 03:10.774
[Gottlief]
Right.

03:10.810 --> 03:11.775
He purports
that it's just temporary,

03:11.811 --> 03:13.077
that it's all he can afford,

03:13.112 --> 03:14.778
that he needs
to finish his book,

03:14.814 --> 03:17.114
that he needs the peace
and quiet, et cetera, et cetera.

03:17.116 --> 03:19.500
Meanwhile, two months later,
the book still isn't finished,

03:19.535 --> 03:21.118
the cabin still has one room,

03:21.170 --> 03:23.754
still over an hour away
from his kids,

03:23.789 --> 03:27.258
but we digress.

03:27.293 --> 03:30.461
Mr. Solloway
has also purported,

03:30.513 --> 03:33.631
in the presence
of a mediator, documented,

03:33.683 --> 03:35.532
that he was living alone

03:35.568 --> 03:40.020
when, in fact... as discovered
by his 17-year-old daughter,

03:40.056 --> 03:42.139
sadly just last week...

03:42.141 --> 03:45.643
He has been cozied up there
with his paramour,

03:45.645 --> 03:48.545
cohabitating
with his paramour,

03:48.581 --> 03:50.781
and even, shockingly,
fantastically,

03:50.816 --> 03:54.118
has proposed to this paramour

03:54.153 --> 03:56.453
despite the fact
that he's still married

03:56.489 --> 04:00.324
to the mother
of his four children.

04:00.376 --> 04:02.159
Maybe it's just me,

04:02.211 --> 04:04.962
but I have to ask
why a man who claims

04:04.997 --> 04:07.731
to want shared custody
of his four children

04:07.767 --> 04:10.801
who claims that he can't
afford suitable housing

04:10.836 --> 04:13.504
for these children
is spending money

04:13.556 --> 04:16.473
he does not have
on a diamond engagement ring.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.142
- Your Honor...
- Now, to me,

04:18.177 --> 04:20.844
there is absolutely no question,
no doubt whatsoever

04:20.880 --> 04:24.348
that Whitney and Trevor
and Martin and Stacey

04:24.350 --> 04:25.849
would be so much better off

04:25.901 --> 04:28.152
in the full custody
of their mother.

04:28.187 --> 04:30.354
Visitation?
Absolutely, of course.

04:30.406 --> 04:32.856
But are we really going to ask
these four kids

04:32.908 --> 04:35.743
to split their time,
to camp out

04:35.778 --> 04:39.263
way up in the... in the woods
three, four times a week

04:39.298 --> 04:41.532
when they have a whole
brownstone all to themselves?

04:41.584 --> 04:43.751
A beautiful home
right around the corner

04:43.786 --> 04:45.703
from their school,
right next to their friends?

04:45.705 --> 04:48.105
- Hold it.
- [Gottlief] Yes, please.

04:48.140 --> 04:51.709
Did you say your client lives
in a brownstone?

04:53.713 --> 04:56.714
That is correct,
with her four children.

04:56.799 --> 04:58.682
[Judge Polk]
A whole brownstone you said?

04:58.718 --> 05:01.018
[Gottlief] Well, yes,
but I don't think that that's...

05:01.053 --> 05:03.721
Does your client own
this "whole brownstone"?

05:03.723 --> 05:05.889
[Gottlief]
Not outright, Your Honor.

05:05.941 --> 05:08.859
It was purchased
through a trust in 2003.

05:08.894 --> 05:11.228
And the neighborhood?

05:11.230 --> 05:12.896
I'm sorry?

05:12.898 --> 05:15.165
[Judge Polk]
Where does your client live?

05:16.635 --> 05:18.302
Park Slope.

05:18.337 --> 05:20.704
Ah.

05:20.740 --> 05:22.906
The lovely Park Slope.

05:24.777 --> 05:29.279
And, uh, this building
is worth approximately...

05:29.315 --> 05:30.547
- Do we know?
- Very difficult to say...

05:30.583 --> 05:34.385
$3,175,000.
Give or take.

05:34.420 --> 05:35.636
That's off of recent sales,

05:35.671 --> 05:37.921
comparable properties
in the area.

05:37.973 --> 05:40.391
[Judge Polk]
Right.

05:40.426 --> 05:44.128
The kids' school
around the corner,

05:44.196 --> 05:46.296
is that a private school?

05:48.517 --> 05:49.933
Amazing.

05:49.935 --> 05:51.652
Four judges in rotation,
and we get stuck

05:51.687 --> 05:53.937
with the one
committed Bolshevik?

05:53.939 --> 05:56.106
I thought you said Noah
didn't want your parents' money.

05:56.108 --> 05:57.775
That's what he said
in mediation.

05:57.827 --> 05:59.743
Was this before or after
the Walden shtick?

05:59.779 --> 06:03.414
"I just want to sit by my pond,
me and my lonely laptop."

06:03.449 --> 06:06.617

get together before next Friday,

06:11.540 --> 06:15.175
Shit. I got a lunch
back in the city.

06:15.211 --> 06:17.928
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Maybe.

06:17.963 --> 06:20.013
If you stop
saying "paramour."

06:20.049 --> 06:21.198

06:21.233 --> 06:22.349
I mean, what the fuck
is that, Jon?

06:22.385 --> 06:24.134
You said it 14 times.

06:24.136 --> 06:26.103
Well, it happens to be
the legal term for it,

06:26.138 --> 06:28.305
but if you prefer,
I could say

06:28.307 --> 06:30.941
"concubine,"
"fuck buddy"?

06:30.976 --> 06:32.359
- "Slut face"?
- How about "cunt"?

06:32.395 --> 06:35.045
- Cunt works for me.
- Got it. I'll do that.

07:15.271 --> 07:16.687
Very funny.

07:16.739 --> 07:18.071
Six minutes, Whitney.

07:18.107 --> 07:21.258
- Isn't your train at one?
- 1:40.

07:21.293 --> 07:23.360
I told Augusto
where I was going.

07:23.412 --> 07:25.362
Somehow he'd never heard
of Bryn Mawr,

07:25.364 --> 07:28.165
but he's foreign,
so I forgave that.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.335
When I told him
about my 50th reunion,

07:31.370 --> 07:34.588
Augusto
understood completely.

07:34.623 --> 07:35.939
I'm transformed.

07:35.975 --> 07:38.041
Noah wants money.

07:38.043 --> 07:39.610
I'm sorry?

07:39.645 --> 07:41.261
Were you gonna ask
how the hearing went,

07:41.297 --> 07:43.714
or would you like to talk
about your hairdo some more?

07:43.716 --> 07:45.716
I was.
Of course I was going to ask.

07:45.718 --> 07:47.050
I just assumed
it went smoothly.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.435
Well, it didn't.

07:48.471 --> 07:50.053
When we were in mediation,
it was going smoothly.

07:50.055 --> 07:51.271
Now that
we're in fucking court,

07:51.307 --> 07:53.056
he's going for
half of everything.

07:53.058 --> 07:55.893
Half the money,
half the house,

07:55.945 --> 07:57.227
half the half-and-half.

07:57.229 --> 07:58.729
That's ridiculous.

07:58.781 --> 08:01.732
Well, our judge
doesn't think so.

08:01.784 --> 08:06.403
Apparently,
we got the wrong one because...

08:06.405 --> 08:07.538
he doesn't like
rich people.

08:07.573 --> 08:09.239
Well, clearly
that's not fair.

08:09.241 --> 08:10.541
Cheers.

08:10.576 --> 08:12.176
I'll call Jon
from the train.

08:12.244 --> 08:14.745
We'll get a different judge,
and even if we can't,

08:14.747 --> 08:16.580
I can't imagine
it's really a problem.

08:16.632 --> 08:18.048
The house
is under the trust.

08:18.083 --> 08:21.134
Actually,
I think it is a problem.

08:21.170 --> 08:23.637
- Like, maybe a big problem.
- Please.

08:23.672 --> 08:26.590

to meet on Friday.

I won't do that.
I can't.

with your lawyer

08:33.349 --> 08:34.898

I can't ask your father
to come on Friday.

08:37.102 --> 08:39.486
Okay, fine, forget it.
Go to your reunion.
