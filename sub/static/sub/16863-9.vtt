00:00.760 --> 00:02.070
<i>Previously on Rescue Me...</i>

00:02.110 --> 00:04.030
We found a tumor on your kidney.

00:04.059 --> 00:06.590
I'm fairly certain
it's renal cancer, sean.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.850
So, what do I do?

00:07.870 --> 00:09.130
Take some leave.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.960
You scrounge up whatever cash
you can get your hands on.

00:10.990 --> 00:16.000
You get that kidney cut out,
pray it hasn't spread, all right?

00:16.020 --> 00:19.570
You try and use your insurance,
you're as good as off the job.

00:19.600 --> 00:20.890
I gotta go hide this cash.

00:20.910 --> 00:22.500
You know what, though?
I got a better idea.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.010
Why don't you give it
to me? I'll hide it.

00:24.030 --> 00:27.420
80 and--
Shit.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.120
Somebody in there?

00:30.200 --> 00:31.410
Hang on one sec.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.560
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
We get him in the ring.

00:34.580 --> 00:37.410
We get some side action goin',
pick up a little extra cabbage.

00:37.430 --> 00:38.930
This is a chance to make money.

00:38.950 --> 00:42.840
Do you really think that sleeping
together is such a bad thing?

00:42.860 --> 00:44.570
Where'd you learn how
to do all that stuff?

00:44.600 --> 00:47.550
Old boyfriends, my mother.

00:47.570 --> 00:48.960
So here's how it works.

00:48.980 --> 00:52.860
I had janet on my pole for,
like, 45 minutes to an hour.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.060
What's the longest you
ever lasted with janet?

00:55.080 --> 00:58.740
We are not having sex.

00:58.760 --> 01:00.120
Honey...

01:00.140 --> 01:01.710
Hey, can I, uh, ride along?

01:01.730 --> 01:03.680
Only if his mother says it's ok.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.560
He gets in trouble, I'm
not lookin' out for him.

01:05.590 --> 01:06.990
Hey, let me get in there.

01:07.010 --> 01:08.570
All right. Here.Suit up.

01:10.910 --> 01:12.600
Tommy!

01:17.520 --> 01:18.920
Copy that,
2-3-3.

01:18.940 --> 01:22.120
In the soho area,
8-1-9 reed street.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.640
Yeah, you know what? Go
ahead and give me, uh...

01:27.680 --> 01:30.110
R.P.S to the building lobby. All right.

01:32.240 --> 01:34.270
Still want me out of this house?

01:39.560 --> 01:44.400
Uh, 2-5-4, smoke unit has been notified.
You're just there for crowd control.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.030
His mother never finds out.

01:52.060 --> 01:54.230
That's the deal.

01:55.520 --> 01:57.150
- Can I?
- Yeah.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.530
You ok, kiddo?

02:01.550 --> 02:03.440
Yeah, I'm all right.

02:03.460 --> 02:07.780
Listen, it was tommy gavin who
pulled your ass out of that oven.

02:07.790 --> 02:10.940
Maybe one day, you'll have
a chance to return the favor.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.330
I hope I do.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.690
I hope you don'T. Come on.

02:22.040 --> 02:26.670
Sid, damien, take a seat.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.980
- I insist.
- I'll stand.

02:31.990 --> 02:35.000
You sure?Sure you're not tuckered
out from all the excitement?I mean,

02:35.020 --> 02:37.230
- it's nearly nap time.
- Up yours.

02:37.250 --> 02:39.610
No, up yours, sid, way, way up yours.

02:39.630 --> 02:42.460
Listen, the kid's fine.
Nobody got hurt, ok?

02:42.810 --> 02:45.050
Yeah, but, you see, I seem to remember

02:45.070 --> 02:48.440
somebody tellin' every guy in this
room with hair on his balls that

02:48.460 --> 02:51.660
we live in a culture of accountability.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.450
Know who that was? I
know.The memory at your age--

02:55.470 --> 02:56.510
- Your
mother's-- - Hey.

02:56.530 --> 02:58.780
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What, what?What?

02:58.800 --> 03:01.230
Jimmy keefe's widow make
you a little sweets, huh?

03:02.540 --> 03:04.540
She bat her goddamn eyelashes at you,

03:04.560 --> 03:07.120
and all that fire and brimstone you're
spoutin' goes right out the window.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.250
- You would have done the same thing.
- No.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.300
No, you see, because I'm the boss, ok?

03:11.320 --> 03:14.070
This is my house. These are my men.

03:14.100 --> 03:19.810
And right now, the boss wants to know which
one of you assholes took the kid inside.

03:24.650 --> 03:28.330
Look, nobody brought me in,
all right? I snuck in myself.

03:28.990 --> 03:34.170
Kid, you really wanna treat me like
an asshole before you take the exam?

03:34.940 --> 03:37.790
Think before you speak.

03:44.070 --> 03:46.930
It was my idea.

03:46.940 --> 03:50.630
Thomas. What a shock.

03:50.650 --> 03:52.050
He did not, chief. It was me.

03:52.080 --> 03:52.670
Mike.

03:52.690 --> 03:55.510
Listen, I thought it would be ok. It's
my responsibility.I was the chief--

03:55.540 --> 03:58.420
Listen, I appreciate you guys tryin' to
cover for me, but I'll take the beating.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.100
I got it comin'. It was me.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.770
It was not, chief. I brought him in.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.300
Listen, my bag of shit,
and I'll carry it--

04:03.330 --> 04:04.080
All right, quiet.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.660
- It was me, chief.
- Chief, it was me.

04:05.690 --> 04:09.650
Quiet!Stop the bullshit. I know it
wasn't you, and I know it wasn't you.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.890
I took him in. I brought him out, ok?

04:11.910 --> 04:13.290
- It was simple as that.
- You did not.

04:13.320 --> 04:13.710
Guys, I
don't--

04:13.740 --> 04:15.560
We all gotta share the
blame on this thing.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.310
We didn't think anything
was gonna happen.

04:19.649 --> 04:21.600
Quiet.

04:22.300 --> 04:25.240
Unit 3-5, I
show you 10-8.

04:25.270 --> 04:28.730
Try 9. Give a 10-12 to...

04:28.760 --> 04:29.840
Yeah.

04:29.860 --> 04:33.400
You don't think I'm gonna come down
on you like a ton of goddamn bricks?

04:34.270 --> 04:38.740
You see, unlike feinberg
here, I got no enemies at H.Q.

04:38.770 --> 04:41.680
I'm a popular guy most places.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.900
Really?

04:43.930 --> 04:47.100
Not in this room, apparently.

04:47.130 --> 04:48.680
In my office, now.

04:48.700 --> 04:50.380
And, the rest of you, go wash up.

04:50.400 --> 04:55.760
Anything you wanna say to me, you
can say to me in front of the guys.

04:57.070 --> 05:01.510
1--he has absolutely no technical training
yet on how to handle himself in a burn,

05:01.520 --> 05:04.530
2--that's your 20-year-old
godson you almost got killed,

05:04.550 --> 05:10.120
and 3--you already got one dead kid on your
conscience. You really want another one?

05:15.780 --> 05:17.270
In the office.

05:22.830 --> 05:24.580
I said wash up.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.490
There's no reason to be nervous.

06:34.490 --> 06:37.400
I'm not gonna jump over
the desk and attack you.

06:41.890 --> 06:43.770
Go ahead.

06:46.380 --> 06:49.070
Typical management.

06:50.830 --> 06:53.440
I didn't ask for this
desk. But you took it.

06:53.460 --> 06:57.480
And you wouldn't? Nope,
not in a million years.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.950
You know why?

07:00.600 --> 07:03.770
Do I know why? I know why.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.190
'Cause it's bullshit.

07:07.220 --> 07:10.000
You know what's bullshit, tommy?

07:16.450 --> 07:18.290
You're bullshit.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.200
Not everybody can be reggie jackson,

07:20.220 --> 07:23.420
swingin' for the goddamn fences
every time they get up to the plate.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.060
Somebody's gotta be billy martin,

07:25.080 --> 07:27.980
because without billy martin
keepin' the egos in check

07:28.000 --> 07:31.790
and takin' heat from the owners and
the players and the fans and the press,

07:31.810 --> 07:33.120
you know what you got?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.130
You got a last-place team.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.410
You got anarchy.

07:37.430 --> 07:39.650
Just write me up.

07:39.670 --> 07:42.310
I don't give a shit.

07:42.330 --> 07:45.040
I'm not gonna write you up, pal.

07:45.730 --> 07:48.480
I'd be implicatin' myself.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.490
I saw the kid go.

07:50.510 --> 07:54.140
Standin' right next to his mother
when the rig pulled out of the garage.

07:54.160 --> 07:58.210
Nah, tellin' the
department'd be far too kind.

07:58.870 --> 08:01.760
I'm goin' back to the
fifth grade on this one.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.480
I'm gonna tell his mom on you.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.230
Just like billy martin would have done.

08:17.450 --> 08:20.590
Let me know anytime you
wanna jump over that desk.

08:20.610 --> 08:23.360
I got as much guts as you do, tom.

08:24.150 --> 08:26.120
Yeah.

08:26.800 --> 08:30.470
Well, unless that desk catches on fire,

08:30.480 --> 08:32.850
we're never gonna find out, are we?

08:40.809 --> 08:41.890
Yello.

08:41.900 --> 08:43.610
Hey, uh, terrence, it's me, sean.

08:43.640 --> 08:45.380
Hey!Squirt, what are you doin'?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.690
Ok, could you not call me squirt,
please, terrence? Is mom around?

08:48.710 --> 08:50.350
No.She's at, uh, cheerleading practice.

08:50.370 --> 08:51.750
All right, will you just put her on?

08:51.770 --> 08:53.790
You know, it's about
time we heard from you.

08:53.810 --> 08:55.460
Don't you wanna know how I'm doin'?

08:55.480 --> 08:56.920
Yeah.How are you doin'?

08:56.940 --> 08:58.650
Aw, forget it. Doesn't count
now, because I had to ask you--

08:58.670 --> 09:01.350
Ok, could you put mom on, please?

09:01.890 --> 09:03.380
Ok, squirt.

09:03.410 --> 09:05.040
Ma!

09:05.070 --> 09:06.700
It's phone!

09:06.720 --> 09:09.000
- Who is it?
- Sean.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.360
- Sean who?
- Your other son, sean.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.800
Oh.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.640
What do I owe the pleasure?

09:16.660 --> 09:18.910
Hey, ma. Listen,
I, uh--ahem.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.600
I got some news.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.010
- You're gettin' remarried?
- No.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.180
Oh. What, then?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.760
Hey, is terrence still on?

09:26.780 --> 09:29.280
No. He's in the other room
workin' on his crossword.

09:29.300 --> 09:31.740
He's so smart, your brother.
He's a really bright boy.

09:31.770 --> 09:36.720
Ok.Well, listen. Ma, here's
what I gotta tell you.I-- I, uh--

09:36.750 --> 09:38.830
- I got cancer.
- I knew it.

09:38.850 --> 09:40.420
You knew it? What--what
do you mean you knew it?

09:40.450 --> 09:41.830
You never call with good news.

09:41.860 --> 09:44.110
Just once, I'd like to
hear you call and say,

09:44.130 --> 09:47.450
"I'm gettin' married to
a normal, healthy woman."

09:47.490 --> 09:48.960
Or, "I won the lotto."

09:48.980 --> 09:53.000
Oh.Well, I'm so sorry to disappoint you
with the news of my kidney cancer, ma.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.050
- Is that the kind you got?
- Yeah.

09:55.070 --> 09:57.370
I always said you didn't
drink enough water.

09:57.390 --> 10:00.560
I drink plenty of water, mom.It's
not--it's not-- I got it from ground zero.

10:00.590 --> 10:03.090
I told you not to go down
there, that you would get sick.

10:03.110 --> 10:04.710
Well, what other choice did I have?

10:04.730 --> 10:08.020
- She's right, sean.
- Hey!Get off the phone, terrence!

10:08.040 --> 10:08.860
I'm just sayin'.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.700
Ma, will you tell him
to get off the phone?

10:10.720 --> 10:12.200
Hang up the phone.

10:12.220 --> 10:13.300
You should've never
went down there, squirt.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.690
Oh, you know what? Just don't
call me that, asshole, ok?

10:15.710 --> 10:16.920
- Sean, language.
- Sorry.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.210
- Yeah, sorry, ma.
- It's not my fault you got cancer.

10:19.230 --> 10:20.840
Ma!

10:20.850 --> 10:23.730
Honey, hang up the phone.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.590
All right, ma. You watch
your language, squirt.

10:28.470 --> 10:30.240
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

10:30.260 --> 10:33.050
Well, listen.I-I'm gonna need
to get this surgery done, ok,

10:33.080 --> 10:36.850
and the doctors think that they can stop the
cancer from spreading if they cut out my kidney.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.410
Oh, seany, my poor baby.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.760
I know.I know, but

10:41.780 --> 10:44.510
I'm gonna need you to come to new
york, ma, and be with me, all right?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.220
I-I'm all alone on this one. I haven't
even told the guys in the firehouse.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.400
It's so far.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.970
Ma, it's jersey. It's like an hour.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.300
How am I supposed to get there?

10:51.330 --> 10:54.130
Ma, please? I--I need you
to do this for me, all right?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.410
I'll put you up in a nice hotel.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.670
All right, if you think it'll help.

10:57.690 --> 11:02.460
I do. I--I do,
ok?Thanks, ma.Thank you.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.910
- Sweetheart.
- Yeah?

11:04.940 --> 11:07.360
Do you at least have a new girlfriend?

11:07.370 --> 11:09.720
No.No, ma, I don't
have a new girlfriend.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.970
- Figures.
- Oh, you are such a dick, terrence!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.820
- Seany!
- You're such a dick!

11:13.840 --> 11:15.550
Sorry, mom.

11:15.580 --> 11:20.840
Listen, I am gonna go, ok? Thank you,
though. I'm gonna call you back, all right?

11:20.870 --> 11:22.410
Ok.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.810
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.660
I need you to get in the car.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.600
What?

11:31.620 --> 11:34.240
Whate-whatever it is, I didn't do it.

11:34.260 --> 11:37.340
If I did do it, I apologize,
but I'm pretty sure I...

11:37.360 --> 11:39.980
J-just get in the car.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.710
All right.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.700
Is it--is it an old thing
that I did, 'cause I-- what?

11:44.720 --> 11:47.260
Tommy, it's not always about you.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.290
Headed my way, beautiful?

11:54.110 --> 11:55.390
Hey, coll, it's me.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.610
I know who the hell it is.

11:56.630 --> 11:59.290
You've been watching me from across
the street for the last 3 hours.

11:59.310 --> 12:01.010
Ok, and you think I'm a freak?

12:01.030 --> 12:02.220
No.No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.660
- I don't think you're a freak.
- Don't put your hands on me.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.380
Come on. Let me just talk to you.

12:06.390 --> 12:09.170
Come on, coll, will you just
wait for one goddamn second?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.930
Touch me again, and I'll
knock your block off.

12:16.240 --> 12:19.620
- What?!
- I'm full of shit, ok?

12:19.640 --> 12:22.940
You know how I told you I
was wild back in the days,

12:22.970 --> 12:26.380
how I ran through all those women,
bangin' chicks left and right?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.450
It was all bullshit, all right?
I was just puttin' up a front.

12:29.470 --> 12:33.510
The truth is I've only been with,
like, 5 women my entire life.

12:33.530 --> 12:36.450
So, what, did you spend the last week
banging hookers to up your average?

12:36.480 --> 12:37.360
No.

12:37.380 --> 12:41.060
I spent it sitting in a dark
room alone, thinkin' about you

12:41.080 --> 12:44.360
and about the night we spent in bed,

12:44.380 --> 12:48.540
the nipple thing, the whip cream,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.940
even that peanut-butter ass play stuff.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.530
- You liked that?
- Yeah.

12:52.550 --> 12:54.810
And I figured, you know, what the hell?

12:54.830 --> 12:56.780
Just go with it. It's just sex, right?

12:56.800 --> 12:59.080
So I think we should
just get down and dirty,

12:59.100 --> 13:05.760
do all that nasty, filthy, slutty,
whorey, skanky, animalistic--

13:05.780 --> 13:07.650
You think I'm a whore?

13:07.670 --> 13:11.440
"Filthy, nasty, slutty, whorey..."

13:11.460 --> 13:14.650
Uh, n-not street whorey.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.160
I only did all that stuff
because we're getting married.

13:17.190 --> 13:18.680
Yeah.

13:18.700 --> 13:20.550
Oh, god.

13:20.990 --> 13:22.990
You don't wanna marry me anymore.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.050
I didn't say that.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.880
You don't wanna marry me,
because you think I'm a whore?

13:25.910 --> 13:27.110
Come on, boo.

13:27.810 --> 13:29.400
Shit.

13:29.420 --> 13:32.330
You know, if you wanna marry a virgin,
start trolling grammar schools, asshole.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.390
A-all right. All right, all right.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.740
All right, what's with all
this hitting with you gavins?

13:36.770 --> 13:39.590
Pussies run. Gavins fight.

13:41.480 --> 13:42.770
No shit.

13:43.610 --> 13:45.580
So what's up?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.370
Katy sent us a letter.

13:47.390 --> 13:49.750
Oh. Hate mail?

13:49.770 --> 13:51.400
Hate's a strong word.

13:51.430 --> 13:53.680
You know, it's more like
intense dislike mail.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.730
Basically she doesn't wanna see us again
unless we can act like grown-ups for a change.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.320
First sign of trouble, she's
cutting us off for good.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.480
Ok,
wa--who--

14:04.510 --> 14:06.940
She doesn't get to cut
anybody off, ok? She's 12.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.210
We--if anybody
cuts--we cut people--

14:09.240 --> 14:11.190
Ok, tommy, she can, and she will.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.680
I mean, after all the
embarrassment we've cost her?

14:13.710 --> 14:16.710
Ok. Fair enough.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.310
Wha--I mean, that normal parents
thing, I don't know about.

14:20.330 --> 14:22.810
We certainly can lie our way
around the rest of it.I mean--

14:22.830 --> 14:26.770
You know, I can come over and pretend to stay
over for the weekend, and, you know, we can--

14:26.790 --> 14:28.910
Yeah, and we should keep having sex.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.430
What?

14:31.940 --> 14:34.800
We should continue having sex.

14:35.470 --> 14:37.490
That was in the letter?

14:37.510 --> 14:39.640
No, that would be for us.

14:39.650 --> 14:42.910
I mean, come on. It was great, right?

14:42.920 --> 14:45.420
- Yeah...
- Yeah.

14:45.430 --> 14:50.640
I--you--I don't know what you're
goin' for here.What's-- what's--

14:50.670 --> 14:52.790
you wanna have sex with me?

14:52.810 --> 14:54.720
No, uh--all
this--

14:54.740 --> 14:55.720
- No.
- What?

14:55.740 --> 14:57.070
No, I'm saying no strings.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.810
- No--no
strings? - No.

14:59.830 --> 15:03.460
You're saying that you wanna have
sex with me, with no strings attached?

15:03.490 --> 15:04.020
Yeah.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.670
That's--no motives?
No secret motives? No--

15:07.700 --> 15:09.910
- No.
- No old envy, jealousy?

15:09.940 --> 15:10.600
No resentment?

15:10.620 --> 15:11.810
Ok, first of all, I
don't have jealousy...

15:11.830 --> 15:13.070
- Yeah, ok. here we go again.
- And envy anymore,

15:13.100 --> 15:15.490
- but we are throwing all the rest away.
- What about dwight? Does dwight know about this?

15:15.510 --> 15:19.000
A-and does he have any idea about
this secret, evil no-strings plan?

15:19.020 --> 15:21.420
Yeah, for your information,
dwight and I are done.

15:21.440 --> 15:27.010
Oh. And does--does dwight have that
particular information in his paralyzed lap?

15:27.020 --> 15:29.500
Does he have that? No.No,
he doesn't, does--no.

15:29.530 --> 15:30.130
I know. Yeah.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.980
- He will. - Yeah,
he will. He will.I--

15:32.000 --> 15:34.570
ho ho ho.This is just classic.

15:34.590 --> 15:37.050
Ok, you know what? Do you
wanna have sex with me or not?

15:37.070 --> 15:43.630
All right, no-- no strings, no--just
pure, unadulterated, one-on-one...

15:44.760 --> 15:47.490
Sex.

15:47.510 --> 15:49.230
All right.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.630
It's never gonna work, but...

15:53.550 --> 15:56.240
when do we start?

16:03.330 --> 16:04.420
Hey, tommy, there's some, uh,

16:04.440 --> 16:06.440
guy out front in a wheelchair,
says he wants to talk to you.

16:06.470 --> 16:07.900
Name is dwight.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.330
Wh-what--what's
he doin'?

16:09.350 --> 16:12.870
Nothin'. He's, uh, parked out front,
truck-side, shootin' the shit with niels.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.170
Wh-what's he sayin'?

16:14.190 --> 16:16.310
That he'd like to talk to you.

16:18.170 --> 16:19.890
Can I, uh--can I
get a couple hours?

16:19.900 --> 16:21.090
Can you buy me a couple drinks later?

16:21.110 --> 16:22.000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.700
Ok. Thanks.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.880
Industry 14, rescue 88,
are you still 89 with the...

16:40.730 --> 16:42.990
Hey, tom. There you are.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.450
Dwight. What's goin' on?

16:44.470 --> 16:47.260
The guys, they, uh--somebody told
me that you were here, and, uh,

16:47.290 --> 16:49.240
I was just lookin' for you.I didn't

16:49.260 --> 16:52.020
see you and thought maybe you left.

16:52.040 --> 16:53.470
How you doin'?

16:53.490 --> 16:56.670
Well, I'm still in a wheelchair,
tom, but other than that, I'm--

16:56.690 --> 16:58.110
I got no complaints.

16:58.140 --> 17:01.060
Good. So you're good.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.560
I'm super.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.460
Cool.

17:05.010 --> 17:06.839
Well, I got a bunch of
stuff I gotta take care of.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.940
There is one thing, tom.

17:08.970 --> 17:10.190
Yeah?

17:10.220 --> 17:15.460
You don't mind, I'm a little uncomfortable
even bringin' this up with you, but--

17:15.490 --> 17:17.260
but I like you, tom.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.750
Figure if we're really gonna be friends,

17:19.770 --> 17:22.470
this is the kind of thing we should
be able to talk about, you know?

17:22.490 --> 17:25.359
Yeah, sure. I mean,
we-- you know...

17:25.390 --> 17:28.319
I tell you, it's, uh, janet.

17:28.329 --> 17:31.460
Since she came back from you
guys visiting katy at school...

17:31.480 --> 17:32.450
Yeah?

17:32.470 --> 17:35.350
- She's been a little off.
- Off?

17:35.380 --> 17:39.360
Lately, she hasn't been opening up
to me in the way she normally does,

17:39.380 --> 17:41.370
- if you know what I mean.
- Yeah.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.550
So I was wondering if you might be able
to shed a little light on it for me.

17:44.570 --> 17:47.360
Uh, hey, did you guys have
a dust-up or somethin'?

17:47.380 --> 17:50.280
N-no. I
didn't--a dust-up?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.450
I-- But it--it was
somethin', right?

17:56.260 --> 17:58.960
You know,
dwight, I--

17:58.980 --> 18:02.870
no.Everything was
great. We had a--we--

18:08.100 --> 18:12.670
Dwight, look, you know I'm tryin'
to shoot straight with you here.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.990
I'd appreciate that, bro.

18:15.800 --> 18:20.650
Ok. You know, uh,
something, uh, happened.

18:20.670 --> 18:23.220
It was just a thing. There was a thing.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.200
You slept together.

18:25.710 --> 18:28.710
- So she told you.
- No.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.320
You just told me.

18:30.330 --> 18:34.150
Ok, sh-she had a lot to drink,
and I'm not--that's not an excuse.

18:34.170 --> 18:36.130
I'm just explaining
what happened to you.

18:36.150 --> 18:39.360
She had a lot to drink,
and it just happened.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.620
- You had sex with janet.
- Once.

18:42.640 --> 18:44.860
Twice, but it was--felt
like once, 'cause it was so--

18:44.890 --> 18:46.640
Hey, look.I-I'm not gonna lie to you.

18:46.670 --> 18:48.820
I-I've been there with my ex.

18:49.410 --> 18:54.200
You know, you just get together, you
dredge up all your old feelings, you--

18:54.230 --> 18:55.620
you know, you get desperate.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.040
That's the--drudgery.
It was like drudging.

18:59.900 --> 19:02.440
Th-there was not a
lot of, uh, enjoyment.

19:02.460 --> 19:05.480
You know it's goin' nowhere,
but you go there anyway.

19:05.500 --> 19:07.830
We didn't even know we,
uh-- we di--we went nowhere.

19:07.850 --> 19:12.100
- We didn't--it's-- -
How long did it take you?

19:12.750 --> 19:15.820
Uh, what do you mean?

19:15.840 --> 19:18.610
Were you quick?

19:19.040 --> 19:20.270
The sex?

19:20.290 --> 19:22.360
How long'd it take you?

19:22.980 --> 19:25.830
- I--I, uh... - 10
minutes, an hour, what?

19:25.850 --> 19:29.640
I don't know.I hadn't done it in
a while.It was--it was probably fi-

19:29.670 --> 19:31.160
fi--7
minutes.

19:31.180 --> 19:34.280
- 7 minutes.
- Yeah, total.

19:35.790 --> 19:38.260
But it was a pretty damn
enjoyable 7 minutes, huh?

19:39.570 --> 19:42.890
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, I don't
have to tell you. You've been there.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.230
Yeah, I been there.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.450
- 7 minutes.
- So we're cool?

19:46.470 --> 19:50.280
Oh, we will be cool in about 7 minutes.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.250
Wh-what do you mean,
"in about--" ohh!

19:53.270 --> 19:54.790
Dwight.

19:54.810 --> 19:56.540
7 minutes of pleasure,
7 minutes of pain.

19:56.560 --> 19:59.400
Oh, ok, ok. Uh, I--I
probably exaggerated.

19:59.430 --> 20:04.420
It was--oh, my god. It was probably only
a couple of minutes, actually.Please.

20:04.440 --> 20:05.210
Don't fight it, tommy.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.440
- Don't fight it.
- I'm not fighting it.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.230
Hey, guys. What's goin' on?

20:12.030 --> 20:15.890
Uh, nothin'. Can you come back in,
like, uh, a minute? Give us a minute.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.590
About 6 minutes and 31 seconds.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.140
Yeah, sure. I--
what are you doin'?

20:19.160 --> 20:21.810
- I'm checking the tire.
- He's got a loose nut.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.470
Oh, yeah? You want a
ratchet or somethin'?

20:23.500 --> 20:24.360
No, no. I'm good.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.200
Oh, I think you may need a
ratchet if you got a loose nut.

20:26.220 --> 20:28.360
No, no, no. I got it.
Don't need a ratchet.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.250
Hey, you guys seen lou?

20:29.270 --> 20:30.230
Yeah. He's over there.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.560
All right, I-I'll get you a
ratchet. I'll be right back.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.060
Don't really need one.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.840
- Hey, hey, hey, sean of the dead.
- Hey, lou.

20:38.860 --> 20:39.870
- What's goin' on?
- Hey.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.970
- How's your gonorrhea?
- My what?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.770
Well, mikey said you were
pissin' blood yesterday.

20:43.790 --> 20:47.770
My fellow physicians and I did a little bit
of an amateur diagnosis on the back of the rig.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.170
I don't have gonorrhea, ok?

20:49.190 --> 20:52.650
For your information, it was
a urinary track infection.

20:52.660 --> 20:53.570
Really?

20:53.590 --> 20:56.950
I thought only female sprinters
got that from banging too much.

20:56.970 --> 20:59.540
Yeah? Well, maybe I got
it from bangin' too much.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.270
Yeah, well, it's possible, but, uh,

21:01.280 --> 21:03.930
"a," you're not a chick,
anatomically speaking, and, uh,

21:03.950 --> 21:05.950
"b," everyone knows
you're not gettin' laid.

21:06.370 --> 21:07.450
What is goin' on with him?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.240
He needs a ratchet.
Je--I'm comin', tom.Jesus.

21:10.260 --> 21:12.740
- Just came by to get the cancer money.
- What cancer money?

21:12.760 --> 21:14.750
You know, the money that we
took off the top for the charity.

21:14.770 --> 21:17.480
Oh. Yeah. Well, you know,
look, we had a little, uh,

21:17.500 --> 21:21.820
late-night counting issue. That money actually
got tossed back in with the rest of the cash.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.520
Really? Well, I need it.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.410
Oh, you seem awfully eager to
get your hands on that money.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.300
Well, I have a heart, lou, all right?

21:28.330 --> 21:31.170
I'm tryin' to do somethin' for the
good of all mankind here. Jesus.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.500
Ok. All right, I gotta get tommy this.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.680
It's pronounced "tract," by the way.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.160
Oh, really? See what I'm doin' here?

21:35.190 --> 21:38.990
This is, uh, you know, me doing
something for my fellow man, unlike you.

21:39.010 --> 21:40.660
All right, what's goin' on?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.000
All right, boys, let's
see what we got over here.

21:42.020 --> 21:43.490
Ah, it's--it's
good. It's fine.

21:43.510 --> 21:44.740
- Yeah? -
Well, it looks--

21:44.740 --> 21:45.630
You know, I don't
know.I mean--

21:45.650 --> 21:46.980
Yeah.No, I'm actually
just workin' on that.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.200
I think the tire might be flat.

21:48.220 --> 21:49.560
Oh, the tire? Well,
why don't I get a pump?

21:49.590 --> 21:50.640
No. No, don'T.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.720
You know, let me get a look at this.

21:51.740 --> 21:52.940
No, no. No, no.No.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.290
Holy...

21:57.100 --> 21:59.050
It's a, uh, long story.

21:59.070 --> 22:00.920
It's not that long, actually.

22:00.940 --> 22:01.630
Yes.

22:01.650 --> 22:03.770
Looks like you got your hand on his...

22:03.800 --> 22:06.520
Yes. Yes.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.710
Just...

22:13.780 --> 22:15.550
Thanks.

22:19.490 --> 22:22.780
You know, if you hadn't gone and opened your
mouth to janet about the pills and the booze,

22:22.800 --> 22:27.510
you wouldn't find yourself in this what I
can imagine is a very uncomfortable position.

22:28.260 --> 22:31.220
So you banged her. I could give 2 shits.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.120
But you had to blab to
her like a little bitch.

22:33.140 --> 22:34.780
You...

22:34.810 --> 22:37.730
Ok, it hasn't quite been 7 minutes,
but I got a lunch date, and, uh,

22:37.760 --> 22:38.670
my hand's startin' to cramp up.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.540
I'm not used to holdin' somethin'
this small for this long.

22:43.050 --> 22:45.110
Now we're cool.

22:45.130 --> 22:48.710
You wanna drop those
babies in some ice water.

22:50.200 --> 22:55.180
Engine 18, rescue 87 has
9-15. You may discontinue.

22:57.580 --> 22:59.310
Watch the head.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.030
Give me 2 more.

23:01.040 --> 23:04.030
Good. Good job, frankie.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.200
Good job. Way to go.
You're lookin' good, champ.

23:07.940 --> 23:10.610
Hey, lou, I'm gonna set somethin' up.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.970
- He ain't ready.
- The hell he ain'T.

23:12.990 --> 23:16.320
He's got no wind, his
footwork is so sloppy,

23:16.340 --> 23:19.440
a-and, uh, he keeps telegraphin' like
that, he's gonna get his clock cleaned.

23:19.460 --> 23:23.140
Lou, he ain't fightin' rocky marciano, for
christ sake. It's the department league.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.810
Look, no fighter of mine's gonna get into
the ring unless he knows how to box, ok?

23:25.840 --> 23:28.600
Ok, I think you're forgettin' who's
frontin' this little operation.

23:28.620 --> 23:31.450
All right, you got gym fees,
equipment rentals, dietary supplements.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.450
- Wh-what do you want me to do? -
You got any idea how much he eats?

23:33.480 --> 23:35.400
Hey, hey, lou, come on. I'm ready to go.

23:35.420 --> 23:35.850
See?

23:35.870 --> 23:38.270
- Oh.Oh, you wanna fight?
- I am ready to fight, man.

23:38.290 --> 23:39.090
You think he's ready to fight?

23:39.110 --> 23:39.980
- Yes, I do.
- All right, then.

23:40.020 --> 23:42.590
You know what? Maybe we'll
have a little fight here. Sonny!

23:42.600 --> 23:45.410
This is my old friend
sonny volpe from gleason'S.

23:45.430 --> 23:47.190
Come on, champ.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.100
What can I do for you?

23:48.130 --> 23:49.330
"Old" is the operative word here.

23:49.350 --> 23:50.310
Yeah, right.

23:50.330 --> 23:52.260
What do you say we do a quick round?

23:52.280 --> 23:54.680
Lou, the guy's 368 years
old, and he's got one eye.

23:54.700 --> 23:56.520
- I'm not fightin' him
- 3 minutes.

23:56.550 --> 23:57.890
That would--that
wouldn't be nothin'.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.140
Yeah. Yeah, 3 minutes.

23:59.160 --> 24:00.570
- What do you say?
- I'll kill him.

24:00.590 --> 24:01.400
- No--
- ok.

24:01.430 --> 24:02.680
All right, fine. He'll kill
me? Fine, you're gonna kill him.

24:02.710 --> 24:04.620
What do you say? 3 minutes.
You ready? Start the clock.

24:04.650 --> 24:06.830
Ok. Uh, he does this for 3
minutes, we get him a fight?

24:06.850 --> 24:09.730
You get him to 3 minutes, he's gonna
set you up for your first fight.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.060
- Ok.
- All right? That's good?

24:11.080 --> 24:12.100
There you go. Sounds good to me.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.840
All right, look, just walk
around with the old duffer, huh?

24:15.870 --> 24:17.320
Walk around with him? He's got one eye.

24:17.340 --> 24:19.310
So stay on the other side. Let's go.

24:19.330 --> 24:20.760
- Let's get it on.
- Think he's a popcorn?

24:20.790 --> 24:22.270
- He's a popcorn.
- Is he? Tell him.

24:22.290 --> 24:23.650
A what? I'm a what?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.850
You--you're a
popcorn, big guy.

24:24.870 --> 24:27.140
He called you a popcorn.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.670
Start the goddamn clock.

24:28.700 --> 24:29.660
Start the goddamn clock.

24:29.690 --> 24:31.040
All right, go easy on
him, sonny, will you?

24:31.060 --> 24:32.960
All right. Real lemonade,
isn't he? Real lemonade?

24:32.990 --> 24:33.900
Sure. Sure thing.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.820
- He's serious, huh?
- Popcorn retread.

24:35.850 --> 24:37.570
Go do some damage, sonny.

24:37.590 --> 24:39.260
Ok, big guy. Let's go.

24:39.280 --> 24:40.770
- All right. No problem, franko.
- Ding!

24:40.790 --> 24:42.430
Keep those hands up, franko.
I wanna see that left.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.680
Come on.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.450
Hands up.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.020
This guy ain't ready.

24:50.050 --> 24:51.330
You hear?

24:51.350 --> 24:53.320
A lemonade.

24:53.850 --> 24:55.380
It's lemonade.

24:59.000 --> 25:05.030
<i>Sweet Crusade
- by:  Kerri Powers</i>

25:07.090 --> 25:10.490
Thought you
said--ahem--

25:10.510 --> 25:12.460
you wanted to talk about damien.

25:14.670 --> 25:16.670
I do.

25:16.700 --> 25:20.840
And I think I remember
you saying that you, uh--

25:20.860 --> 25:27.750
it was too personal to talk about
on the phone or at the firehouse.

25:27.770 --> 25:29.390
It is.

25:30.480 --> 25:32.680
Come on. Sit down.

26:24.770 --> 26:27.240
A toast.

26:27.260 --> 26:29.680
To you

26:29.710 --> 26:31.740
for saving my son.

26:34.220 --> 26:36.250
I know you're drinking again, tommy.

26:36.270 --> 26:38.080
- Look--
- Kitten,

26:38.100 --> 26:40.750
I know everything about you.

26:40.770 --> 26:42.860
You
see--ahem.

26:47.010 --> 26:49.000
Shit.

26:51.670 --> 26:53.480
Listen--

27:04.780 --> 27:07.130
'Cause, you see, tommy...

27:09.020 --> 27:11.110
It's safe for you here.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.920
Don't you get it?

27:13.950 --> 27:16.740
You're totally safe here.

27:17.810 --> 27:21.390
You can come here, and you can drink.

27:22.040 --> 27:27.160
You can come here, and
we can do stuff like this.

27:40.870 --> 27:42.630
You taste that?

27:42.650 --> 27:45.090
Doesn't that taste good?

27:46.200 --> 27:49.100
I want my son to be safe.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.360
You can come here,

27:52.380 --> 27:55.500
I'll keep your secrets,

27:55.530 --> 27:58.460
and you keep my son safe.

27:59.730 --> 28:02.610
Drink it. Come on.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.590
Come on and have a drink.

28:13.630 --> 28:15.580
Good boy.

28:25.290 --> 28:27.570
Want some more?

28:35.590 --> 28:37.470
Go on.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.130
Shit.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.080
Good boy.

28:58.800 --> 29:01.130
Good boy.

29:01.160 --> 29:03.260
Good baby.

29:03.290 --> 29:05.100
Yeah.

29:06.510 --> 29:08.170
Good boy.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.630
Good boy.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.230
Ok.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.720
You gotta go.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.820
Damien is gonna be home
in about a half an hour.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.760
- Am I all tucked in?
- sure.

29:39.780 --> 29:41.750
What? What, he's wi--
he's livin' here now?

29:41.780 --> 29:44.150
Yes. I am so happy. It's like my

29:44.180 --> 29:46.820
last stand with him or something.

29:46.850 --> 29:47.920
You know, but don't worry.

29:47.940 --> 29:51.350
I mean, he's not here
most of the time, so

29:51.370 --> 29:53.840
you can come here, and we can do this.

29:53.870 --> 29:57.130
You know, come over and totally drink,
and I'll totally bang your brains out.

29:57.150 --> 29:58.860
He'll never know.

30:02.400 --> 30:06.590
I have needs. You have needs.

30:06.610 --> 30:08.120
It's mutual.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.500
Get it?

30:09.520 --> 30:12.360
And I know that jimmy
is looking down on this,

30:12.390 --> 30:16.410
and he is so proud that his only son
is taking his place at the firehouse

30:16.430 --> 30:21.770
and that you are taking
his place here, at home.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.950
In bed and out.

30:25.220 --> 30:27.450
All right, let's go.
Don't forget your shit.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.460
You sleeping with
anybody else right now?

30:32.480 --> 30:34.290
No.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.710
- What do you mean?
- Janet.

30:36.730 --> 30:38.270
You are. That's perfect.

30:38.290 --> 30:39.890
There was
a sudden--

30:39.900 --> 30:41.060
No, no. No. No, listen.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.040
I totally mean that.

30:42.060 --> 30:44.500
It's perfect.Keep doing it,
because that'll be, like,

30:44.530 --> 30:48.880
your, um, crazy,
resentful, grudge sex...

30:48.900 --> 30:49.470
Right.

30:49.490 --> 30:52.220
And this will be more like

30:52.250 --> 30:57.180
an oasis, relaxing and slow and easy.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.480
Plus you can drink.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.730
- Except not right
now. - Oh. What--

31:02.050 --> 31:03.240
Ok, listen.

31:03.250 --> 31:06.920
I know, based on how fast you came,

31:06.940 --> 31:08.930
that I still do it for you,

31:08.960 --> 31:12.200
and you definitely still do it for me.

31:12.220 --> 31:15.520
I mean, christ, that felt good.

31:15.540 --> 31:16.290
- Yeah.
- Didn't it?

31:16.310 --> 31:17.640
Yeah.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.250
Ok. You gotta go.

31:23.170 --> 31:25.200
Listen, do you wanna
make this, like, a, um--

31:25.230 --> 31:26.820
a regular night thing, or

31:26.840 --> 31:29.560
we should just call each other when
we wanna hook up--you know what?

31:29.580 --> 31:31.820
I'll just call you.

31:31.850 --> 31:34.730
- Are you using sex as a weapon.
- What?No.

31:36.600 --> 31:37.780
Yes.

31:37.800 --> 31:40.570
It's the only
weapon I have, so--

31:40.590 --> 31:42.590
All right.Well, d-

31:42.610 --> 31:43.720
do you want me to call you tomorrow?

31:43.740 --> 31:44.760
No, no, no. I'll call you.

31:44.790 --> 31:45.800
- Don't worry.
- Oh. Ok.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.170
- All right?
- All right.

31:47.190 --> 31:48.750
- I love you.
- What?

34:49.630 --> 34:51.739
- How's the beer?
- Uh, it's cold.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.520
Hey, sweetie.

34:57.540 --> 34:58.770
Can I get a shot of vodka, please?

34:58.780 --> 35:00.640
You got I.D.? Come on.

35:02.110 --> 35:03.410
You got another cigarette?

35:14.060 --> 35:15.430
Hey, dad.

35:21.790 --> 35:23.070
See the markets?

35:23.100 --> 35:24.960
They're killin' me.

35:28.570 --> 35:29.990
I mean, all day today, all right,

35:30.010 --> 35:33.210
I'm on the phone tryin' to talk
my clients through this mess.

35:33.230 --> 35:35.690
I'm tellin' 'em, "hey, calm down.

35:35.710 --> 35:37.000
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:37.030 --> 35:40.920
" Meanwhile--heh--every
second and a half,

35:40.950 --> 35:43.530
my computer screen is just exploding

35:43.550 --> 35:48.140
with all the stocks I just talked
them into goin' right down the shitter.

35:49.300 --> 35:51.280
You know, the market
keeps up the way it is,

35:51.310 --> 35:53.580
I might have to sell one of my boats.

35:58.300 --> 36:01.230
Hey, wouldn't happen to have
any weed with you, would you?

36:03.030 --> 36:05.230
Dad.

36:05.260 --> 36:08.570
Oh, by the way, I just got
this new place out in montauk.

36:08.590 --> 36:09.930
You gotta see it.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.080
It's right on the coast.

36:11.100 --> 36:13.700
Hey, you know, I'm only gonna be
using it, like, every other weekend, so

36:13.730 --> 36:16.550
if you wanna come out
there, just let me know.

36:16.570 --> 36:17.890
Dad.

36:18.900 --> 36:21.620
Goddamn it, what did I say to you?

36:21.650 --> 36:24.870
I told you in the car that I had to
come down here and talk to this guy

36:24.900 --> 36:28.380
and that you needed to
just chill for a minute.

36:29.070 --> 36:30.500
Christ.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.490
Now go sit down and
play your video game.

36:35.430 --> 36:37.010
Christ.

36:37.510 --> 36:40.920
He's just like his mother.
He's always askin' me for shit.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.400
Sorry. W-where was I?

36:45.430 --> 36:47.690
I can't find my game.

36:47.720 --> 36:50.770
What do I look like,
your goddamn butler?

36:50.790 --> 36:52.990
Go and look for it.

36:55.070 --> 36:57.090
Jesus christ.

36:58.350 --> 37:01.400
Tommy.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.170
What are you doin'? I
thought derek was closin' up.

37:05.020 --> 37:06.900
Yeah. N-no, he was.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.500
He-- I
just--I, uh,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.390
forgot my cellphone, and, uh,

37:11.410 --> 37:15.500
just, uh, i came back to get that.

37:15.530 --> 37:18.200
What are you,
uh--what are you doin'?

37:18.230 --> 37:20.060
I'm just droppin' some gear off.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.510
Me and damien have rehearsal with
the band after closing tomorrow.

37:23.530 --> 37:25.060
Right.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.690
Are you drinkin'?

37:31.720 --> 37:33.610
No. No, no.

37:33.630 --> 37:35.630
Uh, derek must have
left that bottle out,

37:35.650 --> 37:40.170
and i found that glass
over on the, uh, pool table.

37:40.200 --> 37:44.260
Hey, uh, speakin' of damien, I'm gonna
need you to back off on that, uh--

37:44.290 --> 37:46.350
that whole deal. I was talkin'
to his mother about it, so--

37:46.380 --> 37:48.580
Yeah, back off on what?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.890
Whatever
you--heh.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.620
Whatever you wanna call that retarded
mentoring thing you were doin'.

37:53.640 --> 37:54.740
And, what, you're talkin' to his mom?

37:54.760 --> 37:56.980
What, are you tryin' to
turn him against me, tom?

37:57.710 --> 38:00.820
Yeah, no, no. I'm-- I'm not
turnin' anybody against him.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.490
You almost got him toasted,

38:02.510 --> 38:04.770
so, you know, I talked
about it with her, and--

38:04.790 --> 38:06.700
I--I don't give a shit...
What his mom thinks.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.420
Neither does he, tom.
The kid looks up to me.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.200
He's in my band, for christ's sake.

38:10.220 --> 38:12.990
I don't give a shit if he's in the band.
I'm tellin' you how it's gonna be, ok?

38:13.010 --> 38:15.810
I'm takin' over. I'm gonna teach the kid
the right way to do things, all right, so--

38:15.830 --> 38:20.330
Oh, really? So what makes you think I gotta
listen to what you're tellin' me to do?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.720
What, just 'cause you were
bangin' his mom today...

38:21.750 --> 38:23.760
I'm supposed to back off?

38:23.780 --> 38:25.670
Listen, asshole. I got news for you.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.930
I don't give a shit
whether you're drunk or not

38:27.960 --> 38:29.730
or who the hell's sucking your cock.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.970
You got no rank on me, tom.

38:31.990 --> 38:33.100
Watch what you're sayin'.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.900
You're a goddamn firefighter.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.640
I'm a goddamn firefighter. Period.

38:37.660 --> 38:38.370
No, correction.

38:38.410 --> 38:41.010
- You're an old goddamn firefighter.
- Don't forget who you're talkin' to.

38:41.030 --> 38:42.560
Yeah, you took a beatin' for me, tom,

38:42.570 --> 38:44.650
because we work together as a team,

38:44.680 --> 38:47.830
and you are the goddamn
senior member of that team.

38:47.850 --> 38:49.250
I'm glad you remember that?

38:49.280 --> 38:52.010
And when I'm your age, I'll
be doin' the same thing, tom.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.720
Only, I'll be wearin'
officer's stripes on my shirt.

38:55.740 --> 38:59.420
You don't wanna be chief or goddamn
lieutenant, that's fine with me,

38:59.450 --> 39:04.090
but until you do, you got no right
to tell me what to do. Got it?

39:04.110 --> 39:06.020
- You can kiss my ass.
- Blow me.

39:06.030 --> 39:07.940
Boy, you got some balls, kid.

39:13.300 --> 39:15.080
Wow.

39:15.100 --> 39:17.360
Keep drinkin', pal.

39:19.470 --> 39:21.340
Don't forget to lock up.

39:29.890 --> 39:31.810
shit.
