00:15.015 --> 00:16.346
Ensign Kim.

00:16.416 --> 00:19.249
l require your assistance
in Jefferies Tube 37- Alpha.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.377
Well, can it wait?

00:20.453 --> 00:21.647
l just got off duty.

00:21.721 --> 00:22.653
lt is urgent.

00:22.722 --> 00:23.848
Hmm.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.686
Bridge to Commander Tuvok.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.826
Tuvok here.

00:34.901 --> 00:37.165
You're needed
on the Bridge, sir.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.864
On my way.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.240
Computer, lights on.

00:53.253 --> 00:54.584
Neelix?

00:57.590 --> 00:59.421
ls anybody here?

00:59.492 --> 01:01.426
Voyager to Lieutenant Paris.

01:01.494 --> 01:02.586
Paris here.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.459
How's it going out there, Tom?

01:04.531 --> 01:07.432
One more orbit and l should have
all the data we need.

01:07.500 --> 01:09.331
Good work.
See you when you get back.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.801
Chakotay out.

01:14.074 --> 01:14.972
Crewman. Ensign.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.303
Sir.

01:16.376 --> 01:17.673
Hello, sir.

01:42.969 --> 01:44.129
lt looks to me

01:44.204 --> 01:46.832
like you aligned
the power couplings perfectly.

01:46.906 --> 01:48.032
l did.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.035
lf you're so sure,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.375
then why'd you need
me to look at them?

01:53.446 --> 01:55.038
l did not.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.312
Then what's this all about?

01:58.384 --> 02:01.182
l've learned from observing
Lieutenants Torres and Paris

02:01.254 --> 02:03.381
that humans sometimes
require a pretext

02:03.456 --> 02:05.424
for being intimate
with one another.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.583
lntimate?

02:10.630 --> 02:12.621
Resistance is futile.

02:20.306 --> 02:21.773
Paris to Voyager.

02:21.841 --> 02:22.933
Voyager here.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.341
My primary warp manifold
just ruptured.

02:25.411 --> 02:26.776
l've lost helm control.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.279
Auxiliary power is off- line.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.815
Thrusters won't respond.

02:29.883 --> 02:30.975
Say again, Tom.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.642
Your signal's breaking up.

02:32.719 --> 02:33.913
My orbit's decaying.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.716
l don't think l can hold it.

02:35.788 --> 02:36.812
Repeat that, Tom.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.983
l need an emergency beam- out!

02:39.058 --> 02:41.959
Voyager to Lieutenant Paris.
Come in!

02:45.031 --> 02:46.191
Neelix?

02:48.968 --> 02:50.993
What can l do for you, Captain?

02:51.070 --> 02:52.594
Where is everybody?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.038
Didn't you see them
when you came in?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.040
No.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.406
Take a look.

03:08.121 --> 03:09.952
Computer, activate lights.

03:17.297 --> 03:20.289
Lieutenant Commander Tuvok
reporting for duty.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.701
ls something wrong?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.932
l think you forgot something,
Tuvok.

03:37.183 --> 03:41.176
lt appears that, in my haste
to report to the Bridge,

03:41.254 --> 03:43.814
l neglected
to put on my uniform.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.625
What happened to them?

03:57.704 --> 03:58.671
They died.

03:58.738 --> 03:59.830
Why?

03:59.906 --> 04:02.397
You didn't get them
home in time.

06:49.575 --> 06:51.099
Hello.

06:51.177 --> 06:52.576
Good morning.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.578
Sleep well?

06:57.016 --> 06:58.483
Not really.

06:58.551 --> 07:00.746
What are you doing here?

07:00.820 --> 07:03.846
l just thought
l'd stop by and ask you

07:03.956 --> 07:06.390
why you didn't meet me
for breakfast.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.448
Breakfast...

07:07.527 --> 07:08.858
What time is it?

07:08.961 --> 07:10.087
7:40.

07:10.163 --> 07:13.257
And we were supposed
to meet at 0700.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.424
l was there--

07:14.500 --> 07:17.060
right after l got
off the night shift.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.728
l waited...and l waited

07:18.805 --> 07:20.773
and l called you on the com.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.705
l...uh...l- l
didn't hear you.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.902
l was having
this wild nightmare.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.444
l was out like a light.

07:26.512 --> 07:29.037
l'm sorry.
l'll get dressed right now.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.082
You don't have time.

07:30.149 --> 07:32.344
You're due
on the Bridge at 0800,

07:32.418 --> 07:33.612
and l've got to get some sleep.

07:33.686 --> 07:34.618
Oh, l hate this!

07:34.687 --> 07:37.281
We never see each other.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.584
l'm off Friday night.

07:41.761 --> 07:43.160
Great.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.821
Let's go skiing.

07:44.897 --> 07:47.422
How about Saint Moritz?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.127
We went skiing last time.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.430
And you loved it.

07:50.503 --> 07:52.437
You're getting
really good, you know.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.939
l just thought maybe
we could run a program

07:55.074 --> 07:58.100
where the wind chill factor
wasn't 30 below zero...

07:58.177 --> 08:00.304
like...Fiji

08:00.379 --> 08:01.403
or Samoa.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.244
Oh. There's nothing to do there.

08:03.316 --> 08:07.412
And you can be warm
while you're not doing it.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.081
How about a compromise?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.384
Um...

08:11.457 --> 08:13.084
spring skiing in Chile?

08:13.159 --> 08:14.217
Much warmer.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.194
A compromise...

08:17.263 --> 08:20.562
How about Tahiti?

08:20.633 --> 08:22.464
Hmm. Tahiti.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.870
As long as l can
go waterskiing, fine.

08:26.939 --> 08:28.133
You're on.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.476
Now, go get dressed,

08:34.547 --> 08:37.640
so you'll at least have time
to stop for some coffee.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.809
l'll see you Friday night.

08:48.027 --> 08:48.925
Morning, Tom.

08:49.028 --> 08:49.926
Mm.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.053
What will it be?

08:51.130 --> 08:52.597
Scrambled, sunny- side up,
over easy?

08:52.665 --> 08:54.257
Just a cup of coffee.

08:54.333 --> 08:55.265
Are you sure?

08:55.334 --> 08:56.494
Breakfast is
the most important meal

08:56.569 --> 08:57.536
of the day, you know.

08:57.603 --> 08:58.627
Neelix!

08:58.704 --> 08:59.796
Right.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.183
Uh...

09:11.250 --> 09:12.308
Neelix...

09:12.385 --> 09:14.717
did you have a rough night
or something?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.118
Why do you ask?

09:16.188 --> 09:19.385
Because you just poured me
a steaming cup of cooking oil.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.255
Actually, l did have

09:24.330 --> 09:26.491
a little trouble sleeping
last night.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.624
Nightmares.

09:27.700 --> 09:28.632
Oh.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.566
Me, too.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.661
Must have been
those three full moons

09:32.738 --> 09:33.864
we passed yesterday.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.567
Well, a few sips of my coffee

09:35.641 --> 09:37.905
should clear the fuzz
out of your brain.

09:37.977 --> 09:40.537
Maybe you should pour yourself
a cup while you're at it.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.086
Seem to be
a little shorthanded today.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.924
Tom and Harry are both late.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.657
l was going to give them
another five minutes,

09:58.731 --> 10:00.221
but l'll call them now,
if you'd like.

10:00.299 --> 10:00.924
That's all right.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.467
l'm a little late myself,
aren't l?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.503
l wasn't going to mention it.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.299
Burning the midnight oil?

10:06.372 --> 10:07.930
Actually, l went to bed early
for a change,

10:08.007 --> 10:10.669
but l had a nightmare and
l could not get back to sleep.

10:10.743 --> 10:12.677
l had a bad dream
last night, too.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.441
You tell me yours and
l'll tell you mine.

10:15.514 --> 10:17.311
Sorry l'm late, Captain.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.644
Well?

10:21.721 --> 10:23.848
l was in the forest
with my father.

10:23.923 --> 10:27.916
We were hunting deer,
which was odd,

10:27.994 --> 10:30.519
because that was something
l always refused to do.

10:30.596 --> 10:31.824
We cornered the animal.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.889
l looked to my father to see
if he was going to kill it,

10:34.967 --> 10:36.730
but he wasn't my father anymore.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.497
He was a vicious- looking alien.

10:38.571 --> 10:41.096
There was an alien
in my dream, too.

10:41.173 --> 10:44.404
And it wasn't from any race
l've seen before.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.842
He had...

10:45.911 --> 10:49.745
sharp ridges on his forehead
and on the front of his neck.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.715
That's what mine looked like.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.184
l don't mean
to be eavesdropping, but...

10:54.253 --> 10:56.187
l had a nightmare last night,
too,

10:56.255 --> 10:58.655
and l'm pretty sure
l saw the same guy.

11:00.126 --> 11:01.150
Tuvok?

11:01.227 --> 11:02.489
By any chance

11:02.561 --> 11:04.825
did you have a bad dream
last night?

11:04.897 --> 11:08.663
l did have a somewhat
unsettling dream, yes.

11:08.734 --> 11:11.430
lt involved an alien
with ridges

11:11.504 --> 11:13.301
on his face and neck.

11:13.372 --> 11:17.138
l'd say this sounds like
more than a coincidence.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.972
Let's get the rest
of the senior staff together

11:19.078 --> 11:20.306
and come up with some answers.

11:20.379 --> 11:21.505
Which reminds me, where's Harry?

11:21.580 --> 11:23.741
Bridge to Ensign Kim.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.444
Computer, locate Ensign Kim.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.613
Ensign Kim is in his quarters.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.088
Tuvok.

11:35.928 --> 11:38.396
Deck 6.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.897
l've got a hunch

11:39.965 --> 11:42.900
Harry's dreaming about
our new alien friend.

11:42.968 --> 11:45.459
That would be consistent
with the experiences

11:45.538 --> 11:47.005
the rest of us have had.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.767
Tell me more about your dream.

11:48.841 --> 11:50.866
Where exactly did
you see the alien?

11:50.943 --> 11:52.604
As a matter of fact, it
was here in the turbolift.

11:52.678 --> 11:53.906
What happened?

11:53.979 --> 11:55.970
The alien simply stared at me

11:56.048 --> 11:58.312
as if scrutinizing
my appearance.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.976
That's what happened
in my dream.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.041
What did you do?

12:01.120 --> 12:03.816
l returned to my quarters.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.686
Did the alien follow you?

12:05.758 --> 12:08.090
He did.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.388
And then?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.726
He watched me.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.094
Doing what?

12:14.600 --> 12:16.067
Getting dressed.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.871
Getting dressed?

12:19.939 --> 12:22.066
Yes.

12:22.141 --> 12:26.578
l don't suppose l should ask
why you were undressed.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.977
l would prefer that you didn't.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.560
Harry?

12:44.597 --> 12:45.757
Harry?

12:45.831 --> 12:47.992
Computer, open door 105- 2.

12:48.067 --> 12:51.230
Security clearance:
Tuvok- zeta- nine.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.607
Harry?

13:06.585 --> 13:09.213
Harry, wake up.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.564
Are they comatose?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.894
Not exactly.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.129
They all appear to be
in a hyper- REM state.

13:24.203 --> 13:26.330
l've tried every conventional
method of waking them--

13:26.405 --> 13:28.373
from drugs to direct
cortical stimulation--

13:28.440 --> 13:29.498
but nothing works.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.805
Do you have any idea
what's causing this?

13:31.877 --> 13:35.870
Scans haven't detected
any viral or bacterial agents.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.940
No cranial trauma,
no neural disorders.

13:39.018 --> 13:41.043
They're simply...asleep.

13:48.894 --> 13:50.555
l'd say it's a pretty good bet

13:50.629 --> 13:53.996
this is somehow related
to the alien from our dreams.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.000
Any progress
in identifying him?

13:56.101 --> 13:57.864
Not yet, but l've got
everyone working on it.

13:57.937 --> 14:00.201
ln the meantime, what's
your recommendation?

14:00.272 --> 14:02.172
Large doses of animazine.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.106
l thought you said
drugs weren't working.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.041
Not for them.
For everybody else.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.238
Until l can determine
what's happening

14:08.314 --> 14:11.147
l'd suggest the rest of you
avoid going to sleep.

14:16.188 --> 14:19.817
l'd say his ridges were
a little more pronounced.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.656
Computer, increase
facial ridge height

14:22.728 --> 14:24.821
by four centimeters.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.127
That's closer.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.258
l think his eyes
were wider apart.

14:29.335 --> 14:32.065
Computer, increase the space
between the eyes

14:32.137 --> 14:34.503
by three centimeters.

14:34.573 --> 14:38.009
lncrease skin color and texture.

14:39.945 --> 14:41.242
That's him.

14:41.313 --> 14:44.077
Has anybody seen
this species before?

14:44.149 --> 14:46.208
While you were awake, l mean.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.274
Seven?

14:47.353 --> 14:50.880
He doesn't resemble any species
assimilated by the Borg.

14:50.956 --> 14:53.481
So is he just
a figment of our imagination?

14:53.559 --> 14:56.892
lf he is, we've all been
imagining the exact same thing.

14:56.962 --> 14:58.259
One possible explanation

14:58.330 --> 15:00.992
is that he's attempting
to make telepathic contact.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.034
He's doing more
than making contact.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.536
We've got six crew members
who can't wake up.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.902
For all we know,
it's some sort of attack.

15:08.007 --> 15:09.269
From where?

15:09.341 --> 15:11.741
Astrometric scans
haven't revealed any ships

15:11.810 --> 15:13.004
in this vicinity

15:13.078 --> 15:15.239
or planets capable
of sustaining humanoid life.

15:15.314 --> 15:18.078
So where do we look?

15:18.150 --> 15:19.242
ln our dreams.

15:19.318 --> 15:23.584
That's the only place
any of us have seen him, right?

15:23.656 --> 15:25.089
So, if we want
to communicate with him--

15:25.157 --> 15:26.089
find out what he wants--

15:26.158 --> 15:27.284
we'll have to do it
on his terms.

15:27.359 --> 15:29.793
How do you propose we do that?

15:31.297 --> 15:32.525
Lucid dreaming.

15:32.598 --> 15:33.929
What's that?

15:33.999 --> 15:35.762
lt's a technique

15:35.834 --> 15:37.927
which allows you
to take control of your dream.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.331
That happened to me once.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.305
l dreamt l was falling

15:41.373 --> 15:43.466
and suddenly l realized
that l was dreaming

15:43.542 --> 15:46.841
and l could fly, land...
do whatever l wanted.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.846
l was in complete
control of the dream.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.245
What happened to you by accident

15:50.316 --> 15:51.806
is something some people
can do by design.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.943
l've been able
to have a lucid dream

15:54.019 --> 15:56.647
by using the same technology
l use for a vision quest.

15:56.722 --> 16:00.021
l may be able to use it
to communicate with this alien.

16:00.092 --> 16:01.582
Maybe so.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.254
But how do we know you'd
be able to wake up again?

16:04.330 --> 16:06.525
lt's kind of like self- hypnosis.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.066
Before l go to sleep,
l choose a visual cue--

16:09.134 --> 16:11.295
something to let me
know l'm dreaming--

16:11.370 --> 16:12.337
Earth's moon, say.

16:12.404 --> 16:13.871
Once l see it, l can wake myself

16:14.006 --> 16:16.133
by tapping the back
of my hand three times.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.766
Perhaps you are capable

16:17.843 --> 16:20.073
of doing this under
normal circumstances,

16:20.145 --> 16:22.272
but these were hardly
conventional dreams

16:22.348 --> 16:23.280
we experienced.

16:23.349 --> 16:24.543
l don't see any other way

16:24.616 --> 16:26.880
of finding out
what our friend here is after,

16:26.952 --> 16:29.250
or how we can wake up
Harry and the others.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.585
Besides, we can't stay awake
forever.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.594
You'll do this in Sick Bay
under the Doctor's supervision.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.027
The rest of you keep
scanning the region.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.497
Analyze this ship
from stem to stern.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.160
Wherever he is, find him.

16:43.235 --> 16:44.202
Come on.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.170
Normally, l consider
a good night's sleep

16:49.241 --> 16:51.300
an important part
of any health regimen,

16:51.377 --> 16:53.971
but in this case,
l can't recommend it.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.173
l respect your
medical opinion, Doctor.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.079
But at this point,
we're out of options.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.479
This will regulate
your hypothalamus.

17:01.587 --> 17:04.579
But in all probability,
l won't be able to wake you.

17:04.623 --> 17:05.714
You'll be on your own.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.156
l understand.

17:09.828 --> 17:11.159
Ready?

17:14.133 --> 17:15.691
Pleasant dreams.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.430
Ah- koo- chee- moya.

17:21.507 --> 17:25.409
Far from the sacred places
of my grandfathers,

17:25.477 --> 17:28.275
far from the bones of my people,

17:28.347 --> 17:30.838
l seek to sleep,

17:30.916 --> 17:34.249
to meet the one who has
visited us in our dreams.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.677
l know this is a dream--
my dream.

19:06.745 --> 19:07.712
l'm in control.

19:07.779 --> 19:08.746
You're mistaken.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.145
Am l?

19:10.215 --> 19:11.648
This is more than a dream.

19:11.717 --> 19:13.048
lt's my reality

19:13.118 --> 19:14.779
and you're no different
than the others.

19:14.853 --> 19:15.820
"The others?"

19:15.888 --> 19:17.549
The waking species.

19:17.623 --> 19:19.454
For centuries, you've
come and found us

19:19.525 --> 19:21.049
in a state that you call"sleep"

19:21.126 --> 19:24.095
and tried to destroy
us, but not anymore.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.393
Now we are in control.

19:26.465 --> 19:30.094
One by one, you will fall asleep
and enter our reality,

19:30.169 --> 19:32.228
where it is you
who will be destroyed.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.865
We didn't attack you.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.236
We didn't even know you existed

19:37.309 --> 19:39.038
until we started seeing
you in our dreams.

19:39.111 --> 19:43.104
Tell me how l can wake my crew
and l promise we'll leave.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.446
As long as you're asleep,
you're no threat to us.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.077
l can wake myself
anytime l want,

19:48.153 --> 19:50.917
and if l do...

19:50.989 --> 19:52.286
l'm going to start
looking for you

19:52.357 --> 19:53.847
in the waking world--

19:53.926 --> 19:55.450
find where you're sleeping.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.222
You wouldn't want that.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.925
Leave our space.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.661
Once you're beyond it,
your people will awaken.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.066
Just tell me
how far we need to go.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.605
There's a six- planet system
less than a parsec away.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.198
lt marks the nearest border
of our space.

20:10.275 --> 20:12.300
We can be past it in one day.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.935
Then wake yourself...

20:14.079 --> 20:17.845
and pray you never
dream of us again.

20:22.487 --> 20:23.647
Congratulations, Commander.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.654
You're awake.

20:25.691 --> 20:26.851
Chakotay.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.756
l'm fine.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.988
The alien-- did you see him?

20:31.063 --> 20:33.122
And?

20:33.198 --> 20:34.130
Well, it was certainly

20:34.199 --> 20:35.928
one of the most interesting
away missions

20:36.001 --> 20:36.933
l've ever been on.

20:37.002 --> 20:39.266
l'll tell you about it
on the way to the Bridge.

20:49.047 --> 20:51.242
Tuvok, scan
for a six- planet system.

20:51.316 --> 20:53.045
lt should be less
than a parsec from here.

20:53.118 --> 20:56.781
l have it, Captain,
at coordinates 139 mark 42.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.289
Tom, lay in a course.

20:59.358 --> 21:00.552
Aye, Captain.

21:01.660 --> 21:02.786
Course laid in.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.385
Do you mind if l ask
where we're heading?

21:04.463 --> 21:06.124
Past the aliens' territory.

21:06.198 --> 21:08.530
Once we're clear of it, Harry
and the others should wake up.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.898
And the rest of us
can finally get some sleep.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.028
One step at a time, Tom.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.734
From what the alien told me,

21:16.808 --> 21:18.605
it sounds like they
have corporeal form,

21:18.677 --> 21:20.474
but they communicate
through their dreams.

21:20.545 --> 21:22.604
For them, it's as real
as the waking world.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.444
Extraordinary.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.177
lt reminds me
of the Australian Aborigines.

21:26.251 --> 21:27.411
They believed the dream world

21:27.486 --> 21:29.477
was no more or less real
than the waking world.

21:29.554 --> 21:31.579
ln fact,
their creation mythology says

21:31.657 --> 21:34.785
their ancestors actually dreamed
the universe into existence.

21:34.860 --> 21:35.986
That's mythology.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.857
This seems to be fact.

21:39.631 --> 21:40.996
l wonder...

21:41.066 --> 21:42.226
do they ever wake up?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.996
How did they evolve this way?

21:44.069 --> 21:45.559
We may never know.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.765
Sometimes first contact
is last contact.

21:59.184 --> 22:01.618
We're approaching the border
of the aliens' space.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.847
Commander Tuvok,
inform the Doctor.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.823
Aye, Captain.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.220
Wake up, Ensign.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.133
What's going on?

22:16.201 --> 22:17.293
You were napping.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.638
ln Sick Bay?

22:20.706 --> 22:22.731
We had to move you here
when we couldn't wake you.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.610
Whew.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.770
How long?

22:27.846 --> 22:28.870
17 hours.

22:28.947 --> 22:30.812
l take it you
experienced nightmares

22:30.882 --> 22:32.213
like the rest of the crew.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.309
Oh, l had nightmares, all right.

22:34.386 --> 22:36.183
Tell me about them.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.812
Well...

22:37.889 --> 22:41.723
l was, uh, in the corridor...

22:44.629 --> 22:46.824
Captain Janeway asked me
to bring you the results

22:46.898 --> 22:47.990
of our astrometric scans.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.328
She thought
they might be helpful

22:49.401 --> 22:51.699
in determining the precise cause
of the crew's somnolence.

22:51.770 --> 22:52.998
Thank you.

22:53.071 --> 22:54.231
Ensign Kim,
now that you're awake,

22:54.306 --> 22:56.900
l require your assistance
in Jefferies Tube 21- Beta.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.971
ls something wrong?

23:01.079 --> 23:04.378
No. l, um...

23:04.416 --> 23:06.850
l'm still feeling
a little groggy.

23:06.918 --> 23:09.011
Then, l'll wait
until you are fully recovered.

23:10.455 --> 23:11.581
Now, then, Ensign,

23:11.656 --> 23:13.851
you were telling me
about your nightmare.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.092
You know what, Doc? Um...

23:21.099 --> 23:25.126
l'm...famished.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.468
Haven't eaten
in at least 17 hours, right?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.132
Very well.

23:30.208 --> 23:33.200
Go eat, get some clothes on
and report back in an hour.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.178
l'll see you later.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.407
You too, Seven.

23:39.518 --> 23:42.248
And the next thing l knew,
l was being boiled alive

23:42.320 --> 23:44.754
in a pot
of my own leola root stew.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.552
Talk about a nightmare.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.616
Well, it was perfectly seasoned.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.726
Well, if it isn't
Sleeping Beauty.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.325
l do look well- rested, don't l?

23:57.402 --> 23:58.801
ls everyone awake now?

23:58.870 --> 24:01.338
The Doc checked us all out
and says we're fine.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.464
Have a seat.

24:02.507 --> 24:05.032
We were just trading
dream stories.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.236
Tell us yours.

24:06.311 --> 24:08.108
Oh. lt was...

24:08.180 --> 24:10.148
nothing very interesting.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.546
Just the usual...

24:11.616 --> 24:12.913
You know, uh...

24:13.018 --> 24:14.383
Who was she, Harry?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.313
The woman of my dreams.

24:21.893 --> 24:26.455
What l'd like to know
is what Tuvok dreamt about.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.226
Yes, Commander, tell us.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.200
What do Vulcans dream?

24:30.268 --> 24:32.429
Aren't you supposed
to have horrible nightmares?

24:32.504 --> 24:35.905
l wonder what a Vulcan nightmare
would be like?

24:35.974 --> 24:38.841
Alone, exiled on a planet

24:38.910 --> 24:41.879
where the only form
of communication...

24:41.947 --> 24:43.380
is laughter.

24:46.351 --> 24:47.443
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

24:47.519 --> 24:51.421
l won't dignify this inquisition
with a response.

24:53.758 --> 24:54.747
Red Alert.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.987
All hands to battle stations.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.893
They're coming around
for another pass.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.829
Auxiliary power to the shields.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.630
Return fire.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.735
No damage to the alien ship.

25:10.809 --> 25:12.208
Our phasers can't penetrate
their shields.

25:12.277 --> 25:13.869
Arm photon torpedoes.

25:13.945 --> 25:15.071
We seem to have a knack

25:15.146 --> 25:16.841
for provoking strangers
these days.

25:18.850 --> 25:19.908
Shields are off- line.

25:20.018 --> 25:20.950
Fire.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.450
l've lost power
to the torpedo launchers.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.889
What's happening?

25:26.958 --> 25:29.722
Power is being drained
from all systems.

25:29.794 --> 25:31.125
We're being hailed.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.061
On screen.

25:33.131 --> 25:34.291
Captain.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.355
Ensign Kim.

25:35.433 --> 25:36.866
Commander Chakotay.

25:36.935 --> 25:40.996
l'm glad to see you
all up and about.

25:46.645 --> 25:47.976
Janeway to Engineering.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.606
We need auxiliary power
to the engines now.

25:50.682 --> 25:52.616
l think you'll find
that impossible.

25:52.684 --> 25:53.844
B'Elanna, report.

25:53.919 --> 25:54.908
There's a localized

25:54.986 --> 25:56.510
dampening field
around the ship, Captain.

25:56.588 --> 25:59.284
l can't give you engines,
weapons, shields...

25:59.357 --> 26:00.722
Everything you told me
was a lie.

26:00.825 --> 26:03.555
This was all an elaborate trap
to get Voyager here.

26:03.595 --> 26:07.429
lt appears you're learning
more about my people after all.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.990
Prepare to surrender your ship.

26:10.068 --> 26:13.333
Captain, three more
alien vessels are approaching.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.339
They are powering weapons.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.604
You've gone to so much trouble
to commandeer this ship.

26:18.677 --> 26:21.145
l don't think
you're going to destroy it.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.077
l won't need to.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.845
Janeway to the crew.
We're under attack.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.152
lmplement defense procedure
omega.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.350
lt's no use.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.916
We've taken every deck.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.292
The ship is ours.

26:53.812 --> 26:55.245
Captain.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.384
All the time l thought
l was negotiating,

27:04.456 --> 27:06.390
they were just setting us up
to fly right into their web.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.857
You couldn't have known
it was a trick.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.051
l don't understand.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.027
They exist in dreams
and reality?

27:11.096 --> 27:12.393
Apparently, entering our dreams

27:12.464 --> 27:13.863
was their way
to learn about us...

27:13.932 --> 27:15.866
perhaps to probe our weaknesses.

27:15.934 --> 27:17.765
Not to mention lure
us into an ambush.

27:17.836 --> 27:19.428
We need to retake the ship.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.199
That means getting
out of this cargo bay.

27:21.272 --> 27:23.137
l checked the Jefferies tubes.
They're sealed.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.800
Maybe we can open them manually.

27:24.876 --> 27:26.241
That's not going to be easy.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.369
They've got people everywhere.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.572
We'll have to create
a diversion.

27:29.648 --> 27:30.910
Any ideas?

27:30.982 --> 27:32.813
l have one, Captain.

27:36.721 --> 27:38.780
What the hell are you doing?

27:38.857 --> 27:40.722
Creating a diversion.

27:40.792 --> 27:45.456
Ensign Kim, it is your fault
we have been captured.

27:47.198 --> 27:49.166
l suggest you fight back.

27:53.071 --> 27:55.062
Tom...

27:55.140 --> 27:56.801
try to get
into a Jefferies tube.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.536
You two work on the power grid.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.770
l'll deal with this.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.480
Stop, stop!

28:02.547 --> 28:03.605
What's going on here?

28:03.682 --> 28:04.979
These are my people.
l'll handle them.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.347
Ensign, that's enough.
Move!

28:25.336 --> 28:26.633
What's wrong?

28:26.705 --> 28:27.797
l'm still asleep.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.840
What are you talking about?

28:32.577 --> 28:33.475
Chakotay!

28:42.520 --> 28:45.284
Commander Chakotay,
you're awake.

28:45.356 --> 28:46.755
Am l?

28:46.825 --> 28:48.190
Are you sure?

28:48.259 --> 28:49.317
Of course you are.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.090
What are you looking for?

28:57.168 --> 28:58.100
The moon.

28:58.169 --> 28:59.136
What?

29:03.708 --> 29:05.107
l don't see it.

29:07.679 --> 29:08.839
Where's the Captain?

29:08.947 --> 29:10.107
Asleep--

29:10.181 --> 29:11.671
along with the rest of the crew.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.717
All of them?

29:12.784 --> 29:13.716
Except me.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.150
No rest for the never- weary.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.414
What happened?

29:16.488 --> 29:18.854
As soon as you entered
your lucid dream,

29:18.923 --> 29:20.857
they all began falling
asleep one by one.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.257
l've been trying every method
l can think of to revive them,

29:23.328 --> 29:24.386
but nothing works.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.191
lt's been 39 hours.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.993
l've been asleep
for almost two days?

29:28.066 --> 29:29.693
lf l can't wake them soon,

29:29.768 --> 29:32.293
l'm going to have to start
feeding them intravenously.

29:32.370 --> 29:35.032
They let me think l was awake,
but l was still dreaming.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.232
You weren't the only one.

29:36.307 --> 29:38.172
Look at this.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.870
What is it?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.912
A neurogenic field
created by heightened

29:42.013 --> 29:43.446
electrical activity
in the brain.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.176
lt's been occurring in all

29:45.250 --> 29:47.775
the sleeping crew members--
and that's not all.

29:47.852 --> 29:51.083
This is Ensign Kim's
brain wave pattern, indicating

29:51.156 --> 29:53.386
that he's dreaming
in a hyper- REM state.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.484
This is Crewman Foster's
pattern.

29:56.561 --> 29:58.290
They're identical.

29:58.363 --> 30:03.323
Lieutenant Torres, Captain
Janeway, Commander Tuvok...

30:03.401 --> 30:05.926
l don't know what it means.

30:06.004 --> 30:08.632
l think l do.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.834
Not only are they dreaming,

30:11.910 --> 30:14.435
they're all having
the same dream.

30:20.385 --> 30:21.352
lt wasn't just my dream.

30:21.419 --> 30:22.351
lt was a communal dream.

30:22.420 --> 30:23.785
Everyone's REM patterns
are identical.

30:23.855 --> 30:25.516
They're experiencing
the same images,

30:25.590 --> 30:27.490
each from his or her
own point of view.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.356
Yes. l saw the rest
of the crew--

30:29.427 --> 30:30.519
interacted with them.

30:30.595 --> 30:33.723
We were all working together
to fight off an alien attack.

30:33.798 --> 30:34.787
Which wasn't real.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.094
Oh, we're under attack,
all right.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.327
Commander?

30:37.402 --> 30:38.426
Maybe this is the way

30:38.503 --> 30:40.130
these aliens
fight their enemies.

30:40.205 --> 30:42.435
They exist somewhere
in our reality

30:42.507 --> 30:43.531
as physical beings,

30:43.608 --> 30:47.044
but they must be asleep,
unable to defend themselves

30:47.111 --> 30:48.908
against what they call
"waking species."

30:48.980 --> 30:51.813
We'll never defeat them
in their dream reality,

30:51.883 --> 30:54.317
but if we can find them,
find where they're sleeping,

30:54.385 --> 30:55.443
we'll have the advantage.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.544
But we've been scanning

30:56.621 --> 30:57.747
for life- forms
since this started

30:57.822 --> 30:58.846
and we haven't found anything.

30:58.923 --> 31:01.016
Maybe we've been looking
in the wrong place.

31:01.125 --> 31:04.060
l'm betting a species that
spends its time sleeping

31:04.095 --> 31:05.357
isn't going to be hanging around

31:05.430 --> 31:07.421
where conventional scans
can locate them.

31:07.498 --> 31:08.795
So, how do we find them?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.801
This neurogenic
field you mentioned--

31:10.869 --> 31:13.702
anyone in a hyper- REM state
would be producing one.

31:13.771 --> 31:14.760
ln theory, yes.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.166
So if we scan
for other neurogenic fields,

31:18.243 --> 31:19.801
it might lead us
to the sleeping aliens.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.210
lf you need me,
l'll be on the Bridge.

31:33.558 --> 31:35.458
Time for a little energy boost,
Commander.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.153
We don't want you drifting
back to sleep.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.923
Sorry about the mess,

31:38.997 --> 31:40.828
but this is what happens
when my repeated requests

31:40.899 --> 31:43.527
for a larger Sick Bay
fall on deaf ears.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.665
What is it?

31:51.743 --> 31:54.143
Scanners have detected
a neurogenic field

31:54.212 --> 31:56.146
emanating from
beneath the surface of a planet

31:56.214 --> 31:57.977
less than a light- year
from here.

31:58.049 --> 32:01.485
Excuse me, Tom, but l've
got to change our course.

32:08.726 --> 32:10.216
Still dreaming?

32:10.295 --> 32:11.922
How is that possible?

32:12.030 --> 32:13.520
l don't know, but that's
what Chakotay said

32:13.598 --> 32:14.792
right before he vanished.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.094
That doesn't make any sense.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.601
He was wide awake
right here with us.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.661
He said something
about still being asleep

32:20.738 --> 32:22.763
and then he started tapping
the back of his hand

32:22.840 --> 32:25.206
like he said he would
to wake up from his lucid dream.

32:25.276 --> 32:27.403
And then he disappeared.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.947
The question is:
Where did he go?

32:32.016 --> 32:34.780
The aliens must
have transported him somewhere.

32:34.852 --> 32:36.786
Or perhaps he did wake up.

32:36.854 --> 32:37.878
Tuvok?

32:37.956 --> 32:41.289
lt's possible he was dreaming
all of this.

32:41.359 --> 32:43.725
Wait a minute.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.764
lf Chakotay was dreaming
and he woke up,

32:46.831 --> 32:48.389
what are we doing here?

32:48.466 --> 32:50.764
Perhaps we are dreaming
as well.

32:50.835 --> 32:52.632
Now l'm lost.

32:52.704 --> 32:54.296
You're not the only one.

32:54.372 --> 32:56.897
Consider that we all
experienced nightmares

32:56.975 --> 32:58.499
about an alien whose people

32:58.576 --> 33:01.010
apparently live out their lives
in a dream state.

33:01.112 --> 33:04.275
Perhaps we are in that state
this very moment.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.213
That's ridiculous.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.215
We're not asleep.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.251
Wait.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.250
When you dream,

33:08.319 --> 33:10.184
you're rarely aware
that you're sleeping.

33:10.254 --> 33:12.313
l can understand
how we could mistake dreaming

33:12.390 --> 33:14.915
for reality,
but that doesn't explain

33:14.993 --> 33:17.086
how we're all interacting
with one another.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.685
Maybe we're not.

33:18.763 --> 33:19.889
Not what?

33:19.964 --> 33:21.591
lnteracting with one another.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.829
Maybe this is all
one person's dream--

33:24.902 --> 33:26.335
if, for example, mine--

33:26.404 --> 33:27.462
and none of you are really here.

33:27.538 --> 33:29.938
Trust me, Neelix,
l wish l weren't, but l'm here.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.736
Collective unconsciousness.

33:31.809 --> 33:34.539
Seven, come here.

33:36.381 --> 33:39.646
The Borg share
a collective consciousness.

33:39.717 --> 33:41.378
These aliens
may have somehow induced

33:41.452 --> 33:43.215
a state
of collective unconsciousness.

33:43.287 --> 33:47.519
You mean...we're all
sharing the same dream?

33:47.592 --> 33:49.253
lt is possible.

33:49.327 --> 33:52.160
This is all
fascinating speculation,

33:52.230 --> 33:53.993
but unless we have proof
to the contrary,

33:54.065 --> 33:55.999
we have to treat this
like an invasion.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.297
l managed to open
a Jefferies tube hatch.

33:58.369 --> 33:59.631
Good work.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.001
Neelix, Seven, Kim,

34:01.105 --> 34:03.073
do what you can
to distract the guards.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.631
We're going to find a way
to retake the ship.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.915
Looks like a complete
power drain.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.648
Their dampening field
has shut down the warp core.

34:17.722 --> 34:18.654
Which begs the question

34:18.723 --> 34:20.418
of what they intend to do
with an unpowered ship.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.688
Tuvok, grab some phaser rifles
from the weapons locker.

34:25.228 --> 34:26.525
Something tells me
that when we try

34:26.597 --> 34:27.757
to disable the dampening field,

34:27.831 --> 34:29.322
we're going to get
the aliens' attention.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.927
lt looks like they're using
harmonic inversion technology.

34:33.036 --> 34:35.699
lf l can isolate
the containment frequency,

34:35.773 --> 34:38.139
l may be able to get
main power back on line.

34:43.714 --> 34:44.976
That was easy.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.415
Warning. Warp core breach
in 60 seconds.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.850
Maybe a little too easy.

34:48.920 --> 34:49.944
l don't understand.

34:50.021 --> 34:50.953
Can you eject the core?

34:51.022 --> 34:52.512
l'm trying.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.114
lt's not working.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.489
Warp core breach in 50 seconds.

34:58.563 --> 34:59.996
We've got to get out of here.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.693
l'm trying to put a containment
field around Engineering.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.963
Warp core breach in 40 seconds.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.004
Got it! Let's move!

35:08.039 --> 35:11.236
l don't understand why you
couldn't eject the core!

35:11.309 --> 35:13.300
Warp core breach in 30 seconds.

35:13.377 --> 35:15.845
Something's not right.

35:15.913 --> 35:17.210
Captain, we must hurry!

35:17.281 --> 35:18.748
l'm going back in there.

35:18.816 --> 35:19.840
You'll be killed!

35:19.917 --> 35:20.884
Warp core breach...

35:20.952 --> 35:22.510
l think l'm onto something.
You two go!

35:22.587 --> 35:23.212
Captain!

35:23.287 --> 35:24.652
That's an order!

35:25.990 --> 35:27.924
Warp core breach in ten seconds.

35:27.992 --> 35:31.519
Nine, eight, seven, six...

35:32.563 --> 35:37.159
five, four, three, two, one.

35:47.712 --> 35:52.149
Either l've become impervious
to antimatter explosions...

35:52.216 --> 35:54.446
or we're still dreaming.

36:00.224 --> 36:02.351
A warp core explosion
should have destroyed the ship.

36:02.426 --> 36:05.327
lf l were awake,
or if any of this were real,

36:05.396 --> 36:06.863
which it obviously isn't.

36:06.931 --> 36:08.489
Things just weren't adding up--

36:08.566 --> 36:12.366
Chakotay's disappearance,
the warp core failing to eject.

36:12.436 --> 36:14.028
And as Chakotay said

36:14.105 --> 36:17.336
"lucid dreaming
is about taking control"

36:17.408 --> 36:19.273
so l...took a chance.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.277
Surely, there must have been
a less extreme method

36:21.345 --> 36:22.471
of testing your assumptions.

36:22.547 --> 36:25.812
As Captain, you shouldn't be
taking chances with your life.

36:25.883 --> 36:27.908
l'm touched by your concern,
Tuvok.

36:27.985 --> 36:30.818
Now that we know
this is a dream...

36:30.888 --> 36:32.685
what do we do?

36:32.757 --> 36:35.521
l suggest we find a way
to regain consciousness.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.724
Captain, how did
you wake yourself?

36:43.801 --> 36:44.859
The same way you did.

36:44.936 --> 36:45.925
The others?

36:46.003 --> 36:47.493
They should all be
starting to wake up.

36:47.572 --> 36:49.870
Rise and shine, Mr. Paris.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.774
We need to get as far away
from their planet as possible.

36:52.843 --> 36:53.901
Agreed.

36:53.978 --> 36:55.946
l'll make the necessary
course correction.

36:59.584 --> 37:00.983
What is it?

37:02.853 --> 37:04.844
This isn't real.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.719
Of course it is.

37:08.125 --> 37:09.490
See?

37:09.560 --> 37:11.118
No.

37:16.934 --> 37:17.866
Doctor?

37:17.935 --> 37:19.869
He's paranoid-- disoriented.

37:19.937 --> 37:21.165
l suspect much of the crew

37:21.239 --> 37:23.537
will suffer similar
symptoms when they awake.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.543
Try to relax, Commander.

37:26.611 --> 37:27.543
l'm going to sedate you.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.477
No! l need to wake up,
not sleep!

37:29.547 --> 37:30.912
l'm here to help you.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.041
No!

37:34.685 --> 37:36.380
lt's all right, Commander.

37:36.454 --> 37:38.012
You're awake again.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.659
What happened?

37:43.728 --> 37:45.093
You dozed off.

37:45.162 --> 37:47.562
l couldn't wake myself
like l did before.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.190
Our proximity
to the neurogenic field

37:49.267 --> 37:51.258
is making it more difficult
to stay conscious.

37:51.335 --> 37:53.269
l need to get down there and
find a way to neutralize it.

37:53.337 --> 37:54.395
Not so fast.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.872
This is a highly potent
animazine derivative.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.533
lf you feel yourself
falling asleep again,

37:58.609 --> 37:59.871
you must use it.

37:59.944 --> 38:03.243
And, Commander, l suggest
we keep an open com line.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.110
l may need to provide you
with a verbal splash

38:05.149 --> 38:06.844
of cold water
every now and then.

38:13.624 --> 38:15.558
lt's not working.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.594
lt's safe to assume
that Chakotay and the Doctor

38:17.662 --> 38:20.062
are making every effort
to wake us from our sleep.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.099
We have to let the rest of
the crew know what's happening--

38:22.166 --> 38:23.656
that as long as they know
they're in a dream,

38:23.734 --> 38:24.860
they can't be harmed.

38:24.935 --> 38:26.562
And if the aliens
try to stop us?

38:26.637 --> 38:28.867
Then we turn this dreamworld
of theirs...

38:28.939 --> 38:30.930
into a nightmare.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.022
Okay, Doctor...

38:47.091 --> 38:48.285
l'm in.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.951
Acknowledged, Commander.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.022
Stand aside.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.658
Your weapons are useless
against us.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.133
You're not fooling anyone.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.829
We know this is a dream.

39:32.903 --> 39:34.632
You're confused.

39:34.705 --> 39:38.163
Actually, l'm finally
seeing things clearly.

39:38.242 --> 39:40.267
Shoot them.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.745
Now, stand aside.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.824
All of you, listen closely.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.917
What we have to do
is stay in control of the dream.

39:56.994 --> 39:58.928
lf we can do that,

39:59.029 --> 40:01.259
the aliens shouldn't
be able to hurt us.

40:04.235 --> 40:07.068
You sound very sure
of yourself, Captain.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.834
Why shouldn't l be?

40:09.907 --> 40:11.636
Have you thought
about what's happening

40:11.709 --> 40:13.267
to your bodies
in the waking world?

40:13.344 --> 40:15.710
How long do you think
they'll survive

40:15.880 --> 40:17.245
without nourishment?

40:17.314 --> 40:18.611
Without physical activity?

40:18.682 --> 40:22.743
Your bodies are withering
away as we speak.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.617
You can't stop it.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.952
Don't be so sure.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.649
lt's some kind of transmitter.

40:28.726 --> 40:30.990
lt looks like they use it
to amplify

40:31.095 --> 40:32.392
the neurogenic field.

40:32.463 --> 40:33.987
Can you turn it off?

40:34.098 --> 40:35.861
l tried knocking it out
with my phaser,

40:35.933 --> 40:37.833
but there's some kind
of force field.

40:41.472 --> 40:42.837
Commander?

40:42.907 --> 40:44.499
l'm sorry.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.042
l'm having trouble
concentrating.

40:46.143 --> 40:47.906
Time for your medicine.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.790
Doctor, this animazine--
it's pretty powerful.

41:01.892 --> 41:04.759
Yes. And l suggest
you take it immediately.

41:04.795 --> 41:07.059
These aliens...

41:07.131 --> 41:09.725
they look pretty frail.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.926
That's fascinating, Commander.

41:11.001 --> 41:12.969
Now please inject yourself.

41:15.639 --> 41:17.698
They probably wouldn't have
the same tolerance

41:17.775 --> 41:18.935
for stimulants that we do.

41:19.009 --> 41:20.533
What are you getting at?

41:20.611 --> 41:22.306
The animazine might be capable

41:22.379 --> 41:23.778
of waking up
one of these aliens.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.509
Commander, l'd be
happy to discuss

41:25.583 --> 41:26.982
comparative pharmacology
with you

41:27.084 --> 41:29.552
after you administer
your injection.

41:29.620 --> 41:32.214
Actually...l think
l'm going to give it

41:32.289 --> 41:33.984
to one
of my sleepy friends here.

41:34.058 --> 41:36.083
What would that accomplish?

41:36.160 --> 41:37.525
lf l can wake him up,

41:37.595 --> 41:40.996
l might be able to get him
to deactivate this generator.

41:41.098 --> 41:42.929
There's not enough animazine
for two doses.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.161
lf you fall asleep again,
there's no way l can revive you.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.998
Doctor, l want you
to go to the Bridge.

41:49.073 --> 41:50.631
Commander...

41:50.708 --> 41:52.175
l'm giving you an order!

41:52.243 --> 41:54.211
Go to the Bridge
and target my com signal

41:54.278 --> 41:55.336
with a photon torpedo.

41:55.412 --> 41:56.401
You're delirious.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.243
You're asking me
to incinerate you.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.782
Not just me...

41:59.850 --> 42:02.580
these aliens...

42:02.686 --> 42:04.881
and their transmitter, too.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.116
But only if you
don't hear from me

42:06.190 --> 42:07.623
in five minutes.
Understood?

42:07.691 --> 42:08.623
Commander...

42:08.692 --> 42:10.353
Understood?

42:12.329 --> 42:13.523
Aye, sir.

42:25.442 --> 42:26.704
Tell me how to deactivate

42:26.777 --> 42:29.575
this transmitter,
or l start shooting.

42:29.647 --> 42:30.944
What happened?

42:31.015 --> 42:33.677
Looks like he woke up.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.351
l'll give you five seconds.

42:37.421 --> 42:40.185
Four...

42:40.257 --> 42:41.451
three...

42:41.525 --> 42:43.015
two...

42:45.563 --> 42:47.793
Chakotay.

42:51.201 --> 42:53.669
Who's going to help
you now, Captain?

42:53.737 --> 42:56.535
l found the cavern
and your people.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.768
l'm there right now
in the waking world.

42:58.842 --> 43:00.332
And it's all going
to be destroyed

43:00.444 --> 43:01.570
in less than two minutes

43:01.612 --> 43:03.739
unless you deactivate
that transmitter.

43:03.814 --> 43:07.841
lf you are there,
you'll be killed, too.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.852
l think you're lying.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.411
Oh, believe me,
if l don't contact my ship,

43:12.489 --> 43:15.390
you and l are both
going to die in our sleep.

43:21.565 --> 43:26.025
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 5147 1. 3.

43:26.103 --> 43:28.037
With the neurogenic field
neutralized,

43:28.105 --> 43:31.131
l've been successful
in reviving the entire crew.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.540
Unfortunately,
the experience has produced

43:33.611 --> 43:36.079
a troubling side effect
for many of them--

43:36.146 --> 43:38.137
acute insomnia.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.062
Computer, lights on.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.832
Sorry, Commander.

44:04.908 --> 44:06.500
l didn't mean to frighten you.

44:06.577 --> 44:08.238
You're not starting breakfast
this early, are you?

44:08.312 --> 44:10.803
Just rearranging
the supply cabinets.

44:10.881 --> 44:12.746
l couldn't sleep.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.010
Neither could l.

44:14.084 --> 44:16.609
How about a soothing cup of tea?

44:16.687 --> 44:17.813
Sounds good.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.181
l know it's silly,

44:20.257 --> 44:23.055
but every time
l'm about to doze off,

44:23.127 --> 44:24.287
l...become terrified

44:24.361 --> 44:26.329
that l won't be able
to wake again.

44:28.098 --> 44:29.827
You, too?

44:29.900 --> 44:33.063
We just finished a little late-
night hoverball on the holodeck.

44:33.137 --> 44:34.570
Three games in a row.

44:34.638 --> 44:36.162
We were hoping
it would wear us out.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.142
You know, l could learn to enjoy
these late- night get- togethers.

44:40.210 --> 44:42.337
Speak for yourself.

44:42.413 --> 44:44.540
l would kill
for a good night's sleep.

44:49.219 --> 44:51.551
Neelix, l think it's
time for breakfast.
