if you're selling beef,

02:03.725 --> 02:05.592
why did you want a dairy cow?

02:05.594 --> 02:07.327
'Cause tits sell.

happy Thursday

03:02.584 --> 03:06.386
to you, let's brighten up
the day with a big smile.

03:06.388 --> 03:09.222
Today for lunch, we're having
Salisbury steak, sweet corn...

03:09.224 --> 03:10.557
out of my way dork!

03:10.559 --> 03:12.358
Oh, what are you going to do?

03:12.360 --> 03:16.396
I saw that Van Dexter, you
little prick.

03:16.398 --> 03:18.298
Your ass is grass.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.801
Your welcome Tim, don't
let it get you down.

03:21.803 --> 03:23.269
I was bullied when I was your
age.

03:23.271 --> 03:23.937
Really?

03:23.939 --> 03:27.507
I've had hair like this
since I was 11 years old.

03:27.509 --> 03:29.509
The older boys used to
paint nipples on my head

03:29.511 --> 03:31.878
and make me dress like a girl.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.380
But you have a bright
future ahead of you son.

03:34.382 --> 03:35.682
That little turd will be lucky

03:35.684 --> 03:37.517
if he can get a job scraping
chewing gum

03:37.519 --> 03:39.519
off the floor of an adult
bookstore.

03:39.521 --> 03:41.754
But if there's one thing
I've learned in life,

03:41.756 --> 03:44.624
and you pay close attention,

03:44.626 --> 03:46.492
avoid home room like the plague.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.931
Look I know why I'm here, okay,

03:51.933 --> 03:55.568
she deserved to be called
a castrating bitch.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.503
Sometimes these freshman girls,
they...

03:57.505 --> 03:59.372
Warren, that's not why you're
here.

03:59.374 --> 04:01.608
Unfortunately, with the budget
cuts,

04:01.610 --> 04:03.676
there's a chance they may need
to let go

04:03.678 --> 04:05.712
of a guidance counselor next
year.

04:05.714 --> 04:07.714
I'm sure Janet will land on
her feet.

04:07.716 --> 04:10.316
I'm not talking about Janet.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.351
I'm not following.

04:11.353 --> 04:14.254
Warren, you may lose your job.

04:14.256 --> 04:15.655
What?

04:15.657 --> 04:16.856
But I've been here longer.

04:16.858 --> 04:18.524
It's not about seniority
anymore.

04:18.526 --> 04:22.395
The school board is taking a
closer look at job performance.

04:22.397 --> 04:26.833
Part of their evaluation
is based on percentages

04:26.835 --> 04:29.902
of kids that you helped to
get into college this year.

04:29.904 --> 04:32.538
Oh, I am absolutely kicking
ass there.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.941
Well, your numbers have fallen.

04:34.943 --> 04:36.709
With just a few weeks
left in the school year,

04:36.711 --> 04:38.578
Janet is up by one student.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.446
That's impossible, Janet stinks.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.950
That instead of college,
Brian young has decided

04:43.952 --> 04:45.885
to go out to defend our country.

04:45.887 --> 04:47.954
That selfish little prick.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.523
And there's Tommy
brewer, and Vicky Collins.

04:50.525 --> 04:51.791
I got them into Pitt.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.360
They're going to be in
a hospital for a year,

04:54.362 --> 04:55.028
and I have to suffer?

04:55.030 --> 04:56.296
Come on!

04:56.298 --> 04:56.996
It's not me.

04:56.998 --> 04:58.731
It's the numbers.

04:58.733 --> 05:00.433
Well tom, this is my school.

05:00.435 --> 05:01.901
These are my kids.

05:03.604 --> 05:06.439
I mean there has to be something
I can do?

05:06.441 --> 05:08.041
Warren, it's fourth and long,

05:08.043 --> 05:11.344
and you're down by six,
with one minute left.

05:11.346 --> 05:13.680
You have to be Terry Bradshaw,

05:13.682 --> 05:16.983
and throw a hail Mary into the
end zone.

05:19.954 --> 05:21.487
You fucker!

05:21.489 --> 05:23.589
All my hard work to get
you into slippery rock,

05:23.591 --> 05:26.459
and you pull this shit
right before school's out.

05:26.461 --> 05:27.927
I hope you know your goddamn
stunt's gonna have me

05:27.929 --> 05:29.862
living in my car and eating cat
food.

05:29.864 --> 05:32.432
After praying with my
parents and my pastor,

05:32.434 --> 05:34.500
I decided it's best if I join
the army.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.370
"I was praying with my parents"

05:38.906 --> 05:39.906
you pussy.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.746
Laura, hi.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.716
Congratulations, I hear
miss Phillips father

05:49.718 --> 05:52.452
got that scholarship to
beaver college for shot put.

05:52.454 --> 05:53.686
Lacrosse actually.

05:53.688 --> 05:56.989
The important thing is,
college is not for everyone.

05:56.991 --> 06:00.693
A girl like you, might be better
suited for the peace corps.

06:00.695 --> 06:03.129
The peace corps doesn't ask
you to do annoying things like

06:03.131 --> 06:06.666
wear a bra, shave under your
arms.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.034
Think about it.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.402
Ssh.

06:09.404 --> 06:10.404
Just think.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.907
Although beaver is perfect for
her.

06:15.743 --> 06:16.743
Juvie.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.746
Dropout.

06:19.748 --> 06:20.748
Retard.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.819
Danny Whitaker, not a
complete waste of life.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.632
Frank, hey, Warren mulligan
over here at Grandview,

06:39.634 --> 06:41.167
how goes it?

06:41.169 --> 06:43.703
Good buddy, listen, I'm sorry
about that kid dropping out

06:43.705 --> 06:46.873
last minute, but I got
the perfect replacement.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.474
Waiting list?

06:49.444 --> 06:50.843
At slippery rock?

06:51.746 --> 06:53.713
Can't you just white out that
kid's name,

06:53.715 --> 06:55.782
and put in this new guy?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.584
Alright look frank, I need a
favor.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.486
I gotta get this kid in okay?

07:00.488 --> 07:03.756
I could lose my job for Christ's
sakes.

07:05.192 --> 07:07.460
Am I in trouble or something?

07:07.462 --> 07:10.930
As a matter of fact, every time
I walk into the supermarket

07:10.932 --> 07:13.699
to grab a couple of
yams and some baby oil,

07:13.701 --> 07:15.635
I see one of your murals,

07:15.637 --> 07:17.870
I feel like I'm walking
into the Guggenheim.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.071
Wow, thanks.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.974
Big plans for the weekend?

07:21.976 --> 07:23.709
Um, no, no, not really.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.645
So you're not going to
the woods for trout camp?

07:25.647 --> 07:27.580
Oh, um, you know, I'm not
really sure.

07:27.582 --> 07:30.149
I wouldn't have told my
counselor either.

07:30.151 --> 07:31.484
But I know, that this weekend
you're going

07:31.486 --> 07:32.785
to be in the woods with your
friend,

07:32.787 --> 07:34.554
you're going to get drunk,
you're going to party.

07:34.556 --> 07:37.056
And then you're going to
look for this mysterious

07:37.058 --> 07:39.525
group of girls who swims naked.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.626
Goddess camp?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.595
Here's my advice, don't do it.

07:42.597 --> 07:45.131
Yeah, I understand why it
sounds like a lot of fun.

07:45.133 --> 07:47.667
Before you know it, you're
going to be lost in the woods,

07:47.669 --> 07:51.037
drunk by yourself, dreaming of
a goddess who doesn't exist,

07:51.039 --> 07:53.840
masturbating in a poison Ivy
bush,

07:53.842 --> 07:56.509
and there's nothing more
humiliating

07:56.511 --> 07:58.778
than your mother dabbing
Colamine Lotion

07:58.780 --> 08:02.515
onto your grapefruit sized
testicles.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.020
Yeah, I can laugh about it now.

08:08.022 --> 08:10.823
I mean, you guys actually
thought that was real?

08:10.825 --> 08:11.958
It's an urban myth.

08:11.960 --> 08:15.261
You wanna see titties you go
to the oasis on route eight.

08:15.263 --> 08:17.163
Pretend you don't know me.

08:17.165 --> 08:20.967
Seriously Dan, what are
your plans after graduation?

08:20.969 --> 08:25.238
With my friends this summer,
and then look for a job.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.507
What if I get you into college?

08:27.509 --> 08:28.875
College?

08:28.877 --> 08:30.276
I mean, I didn't apply to any.

08:30.278 --> 08:31.744
Doesn't matter.

08:31.746 --> 08:33.679
I got a friend over at slippery
rock

08:33.681 --> 08:36.883
who would love to meet with you
on Monday.

08:36.885 --> 08:39.085
Yeah, I don't think
college is really my thing.

08:39.087 --> 08:41.187
Danny, college is awesome.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.054
It was the best six years of my
life.

08:43.057 --> 08:45.558
I thought I was Henry
Miller for Christ's sake.

08:45.560 --> 08:47.994
I'd sit around naked, smoking in
my dorm,

08:47.996 --> 08:49.996
dreaming about banging Anais
Nin.

08:49.998 --> 08:52.665
She was an author, Cuban and
French,

08:52.667 --> 08:54.300
kinda like a cigar made our of
ham.

08:54.302 --> 08:55.801
Doesn't matter, she's dead now.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.604
Point is, she was fucking hot.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.106
That's real great.

09:00.108 --> 09:02.141
Yeah, it's 1984 Danny.

09:02.143 --> 09:04.043
You're gonna need a college
education

09:04.045 --> 09:06.045
to get any kind of a real job.

09:06.047 --> 09:07.980
Alright, I mean, what
would I even major in?

09:07.982 --> 09:09.282
Who gives a shit.

09:09.284 --> 09:10.816
It's a chance to get out of this
town,

09:10.818 --> 09:12.251
and do something with your life.

09:12.253 --> 09:14.987
Here, give this to your parents.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.088
I'm sure they'll agree with me.

09:16.090 --> 09:17.857
They can call me any time of day
or night

09:17.859 --> 09:19.992
with any questions they have.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.727
You're a bright kid.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.730
It's time for you to start
dreaming.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.605
Ah, bonjour Daniel.

09:32.607 --> 09:33.806
Bonjour mom.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.742
Honey, can we stop with the
French,

09:36.744 --> 09:39.011
we're German and Irish
for crying out loud.

09:39.013 --> 09:40.680
I'm just practicing.

09:40.682 --> 09:42.615
Next year is our 25th
anniversary,

09:42.617 --> 09:44.150
and you promised to take me to
Paris,

09:44.152 --> 09:45.585
since we had to skip our
honeymoon.

09:45.587 --> 09:47.853
Yeah well, that was Pete's
fault.

09:49.090 --> 09:50.856
You were very worth it honey.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.159
Okay, asseyez-vous, you're
dad needs to get to work.

09:53.161 --> 09:54.360
Oh yeah, why is he going to
work now?

09:54.362 --> 09:55.995
They need some extra help at
the plant.

09:55.997 --> 09:57.697
Honey, dinner.

09:57.699 --> 09:58.931
Where you Daniel?

09:58.933 --> 10:00.700
Making out with your gay
friends?

10:00.702 --> 10:04.737
Like some kind of a loser
boomerang?

10:04.739 --> 10:07.873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
happened to sloppy Joe night?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.642
It's Coq-Au-Vin.

10:09.644 --> 10:13.679
It's chicken with onions and
mushrooms, in a wine sauce.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.781
Now, why are you so late Daniel?

10:15.783 --> 10:17.283
Mr. mulligan, my guidance
counselor,

10:17.285 --> 10:18.718
wanted to meet with me.

10:18.720 --> 10:20.720
He says he can get me into
slippery rock.

10:20.722 --> 10:21.887
He, uh, wants me to meet up

10:21.889 --> 10:23.956
with some guy from there on
Monday.

10:23.958 --> 10:26.726
Mr. mulligan thinks I need
to go to college to get a job.

10:26.728 --> 10:30.029
Yeah, I know, it's just he
thinks that it's, you know...

10:30.031 --> 10:32.398
nah, nah, you know, college,
it's a waste of four years,

10:32.400 --> 10:36.302
so, you know what, tell him
he can stop filling your head

10:36.304 --> 10:38.170
with those crazy thoughts.

10:38.172 --> 10:40.840
Bruce, I think that
now is the time for you

10:40.842 --> 10:42.908
to tell Danny your news.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.345
I got you a job at the plant.

10:47.381 --> 10:48.948
What?

10:48.950 --> 10:50.316
I thought they weren't hiring?

10:50.318 --> 10:52.918
They weren't, I got you in.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.721
Tres Bien!

10:55.723 --> 10:57.156
Yeah, but I'm still in high
school.

10:57.158 --> 10:58.991
No, it's part time until you
graduate,

10:58.993 --> 11:01.661
and, and nine bucks an hour.

11:01.663 --> 11:02.328
Nine bucks?

11:02.330 --> 11:06.132
Well, he's actually going
to graduate high school.

11:06.134 --> 11:09.702
Let's see Mr. mulligan
make that kind of money.

11:09.704 --> 11:12.938
So, Sunday, you'll come down,
I'll show you around right?

11:12.940 --> 11:16.142
Sunday, he's going to be
face down in a puddle of puke.

11:16.144 --> 11:18.110
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

11:18.112 --> 11:21.180
So what, I'm not going to
trout camp.

11:21.182 --> 11:23.282
Yeah, he's going to paint
Todd's grandfather's barn

11:23.284 --> 11:24.784
in Pleasantville this weekend.

11:24.786 --> 11:26.385
It's been on the calendar for
weeks.

11:26.387 --> 11:27.253
Oh, yeah, right.

11:27.255 --> 11:29.955
Your brother isn't like you.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.391
He doesn't gamble with his
future.

11:32.393 --> 11:34.460
Alright, he knows
Bridgetown would never hire

11:34.462 --> 11:37.930
a kid who got busted for
underage drinking, right?

11:37.932 --> 11:39.198
Yeah.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.166
Right?

11:40.168 --> 11:42.868
Yeah, I know dad, and I'm not.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.037
I'm not going to trout camp.

11:45.039 --> 11:47.239
Trout camp's gonna be awesome!

11:47.241 --> 11:48.441
Legendary!

11:48.443 --> 11:49.942
And I just hope I can go.

11:49.944 --> 11:50.976
Oh, dude, you're going.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.312
You gotta go, you're our ride.

11:53.314 --> 11:55.081
I told you a thousand times.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.716
Pot doesn't do anything to me.

11:56.718 --> 11:57.917
Pot and chicks.

11:57.919 --> 12:01.787
When I find goddess camp,
I'm not telling you.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.189
Your gonna waste your time man.

12:03.191 --> 12:04.423
You just wind up walking through
the woods

12:04.425 --> 12:06.158
with poison Ivy on your balls.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.159
Oh,

12:07.161 --> 12:09.128
but I have a secret weapon.

12:09.130 --> 12:11.130
My cousin's map shows all
the places he's searched

12:11.132 --> 12:12.898
back since the sighting in '79.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.868
While you guys are looking
for make believe Poontang

12:15.870 --> 12:16.969
I'll be banging the real thing.

12:16.971 --> 12:18.838
Yeah right, dream on.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.906
Hey save some for me dick-weeds.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.742
Guess what my uncle Randy
brought back

12:22.744 --> 12:23.909
from his business trip in Japan?

12:23.911 --> 12:25.111
Gonorrhea?

12:25.113 --> 12:26.145
Good one.

12:26.147 --> 12:28.214
A freakin' Sony Discman.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.116
Yeah, you dweebs won't be able

12:30.118 --> 12:32.051
to get one of these for years.

12:32.053 --> 12:34.053
Alright, I read about
these in rolling stone.

12:34.055 --> 12:36.055
Cd's are just a fad alright.

12:36.057 --> 12:38.924
Yeah, says the DJ from
the honky-tonk station.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.292
Shit!

12:40.294 --> 12:41.460
Just paying my dues there,

12:41.462 --> 12:43.162
but for the record, it's classic
country.

12:43.164 --> 12:45.197
Yeah, for the record,
it's just background music

12:45.199 --> 12:46.966
for truckers getting laid.

12:46.968 --> 12:47.967
Oh, shit!

12:47.969 --> 12:51.036
Ooh, Mr. Danny, that's
cool, what is that dude?

12:51.038 --> 12:54.907
Oh thanks, it's the
cars' next album cover.

12:54.909 --> 12:55.941
They just don't know it yet.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.876
Nice!

12:56.878 --> 13:00.780
He seems a little stressed.

13:00.782 --> 13:03.883
If you got a ticket to
slippery rock, take it!

13:03.885 --> 13:05.885
I don't know man, my
dad seems freaked out.

13:05.887 --> 13:07.086
Take the job.

13:07.088 --> 13:08.821
It's nine bucks and
hour with great health.

13:08.823 --> 13:13.125
And reek of cobalt like his
idiot brother.

13:13.127 --> 13:14.326
If I wasn't already accepted to

13:14.328 --> 13:15.861
the Columbia school of
broadcasting,

13:15.863 --> 13:17.263
I mean, I'd ask his old man for
a job.

13:17.265 --> 13:18.931
Okay, you weren't accepted.

13:18.933 --> 13:21.100
They accept anybody who sends a
check.

13:21.102 --> 13:25.471
Shut the hell up Wachowski.

13:25.473 --> 13:26.338
It's alright guys, I'll figure
it out.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.474
Come on guys, stand up.

13:28.476 --> 13:29.476
To titties!

13:30.443 --> 13:32.278
Trees, and trout!

13:34.015 --> 13:35.548
Allons, allons-y

13:35.550 --> 13:36.415
allons-y!

13:36.417 --> 13:37.417
Let's go!

13:43.156 --> 13:44.156
Hey

13:47.360 --> 13:48.527
why do I smell skunk?

13:48.529 --> 13:52.131
Oh I ran over a dead skunk or
something,

13:52.133 --> 13:54.433
you know what, I should
probably go take a shower.

13:54.435 --> 13:55.501
Hold on!

13:55.503 --> 13:57.102
Come here please.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.073
Look at what your father brought
home.

14:01.075 --> 14:02.541
Try it on!

14:02.543 --> 14:03.542
Let's see.

14:03.544 --> 14:06.245
Oh, it fits you perfectly.

14:06.247 --> 14:08.881
We don't have to special
order it, like your brothers.

14:08.883 --> 14:10.216
Huge head, here.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.185
Oh!

14:13.187 --> 14:14.386
Oh, tres Beau!

14:15.289 --> 14:18.390
Look how handsome he looks.
What?

14:18.392 --> 14:21.627
Aw, you look just like your
father.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.168
Danny

15:04.504 --> 15:05.504
Danny!

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
Danny!

15:17.918 --> 15:21.520
You're going to be late for
school.

15:21.522 --> 15:23.055
Danny!

15:23.925 --> 15:25.124
Oh my god, mom!

15:25.126 --> 15:26.126
Get out!

15:30.997 --> 15:32.998
A woman can be stiff,

15:34.467 --> 15:37.036
when on love intent,

15:37.038 --> 15:38.103
but love has

15:39.572 --> 15:41.373
pitched his mansion,

15:41.375 --> 15:42.641
in the place of

15:45.078 --> 15:46.078
excrement.

15:48.282 --> 15:51.583
For nothing can be sole or
whole,

15:51.585 --> 15:53.519
that has not been rent.

15:53.521 --> 15:57.957
What did Yeats mean when he
said, "pitched his mansion?"

15:57.959 --> 16:01.093
Anyone, anyone, anyone,
anyone, anyone, anyone,

16:01.095 --> 16:02.194
listening to me?

16:02.196 --> 16:05.597
Can you hear me back there?

16:05.599 --> 16:07.333
Oh, okay.

16:07.335 --> 16:10.636
Listen, I know you're going
camping this weekend kids.

16:10.638 --> 16:12.404
I've read about what happens
there.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.239
Please, protect yourselves,

16:14.241 --> 16:17.309
no drinking, or smoking, or
partying.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.578
Catch a fish for crying out
loud.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.446
Or crabs!

16:20.448 --> 16:24.183
That's not funny, that's
a serious condition.

16:24.185 --> 16:27.119
The gaming commission
said you could win $500

16:27.121 --> 16:29.321
for catching the biggest trout.

16:29.323 --> 16:30.589
Five hundred bucks is a lot of
money.

16:30.591 --> 16:32.024
I'm more interested
in smelling like a fish

16:32.026 --> 16:34.760
what's more important Ms.
Keyes,

16:34.762 --> 16:37.062
the length, or the girth?

16:37.064 --> 16:41.333
That's an inappropriate
question young man.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.335
Girth.

16:46.006 --> 16:48.073
Uh, hey Adrianne.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.441
Skanky Ann

16:49.443 --> 16:50.509
up yours dork.

16:50.511 --> 16:54.780
They just accepted me into the
Barbizon school of modeling.

16:56.584 --> 16:59.385
They said, I'm clearly
very fashion forward,

16:59.387 --> 17:02.154
and I show a lot of promise.

17:02.156 --> 17:05.124
I mean that's really
great, you know, um,

17:05.126 --> 17:06.791
so you gonna be at
trout camp this weekend?

17:06.794 --> 17:10.362
Um, yeah, but you know
I'm dating Bobby now?

17:10.364 --> 17:13.432
Hard to miss with you two
making out in shop class.

17:13.434 --> 17:14.433
Oh no, no, it's fine, you know,

17:14.435 --> 17:15.434
Bobby's a great guy.

17:15.435 --> 17:19.704
You know, Danny is going to
slippery rock in the fall.

17:19.707 --> 17:20.571
You?

17:20.574 --> 17:23.208
The only book I've ever seen
you open

17:23.210 --> 17:25.176
is your sketch book for
your little doodles.

17:25.179 --> 17:27.646
It's not really finalized
and all that yet, but...

17:27.647 --> 17:31.383
it just happened really fast,
you know.

17:31.385 --> 17:32.684
Huh!

17:32.686 --> 17:34.520
Well, good for you.

17:34.522 --> 17:36.355
Maybe I will see you at trout
camp.

17:36.357 --> 17:38.490
Maybe you won't.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.092
Todd, why do you have
to talk to that bitch?

17:40.094 --> 17:41.827
Shut the hell up.

17:41.829 --> 17:43.629
Don't let up where
we're setting up camp.

17:43.631 --> 17:47.533
Yeah, but we don't
want them to know that.

17:47.535 --> 17:48.734
Hey, Shelley.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.604
So, uh, where you setting up
this year?

17:52.606 --> 17:54.373
I'm not sure.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.641
Oh, we're going to try
Pyrenees bend.

17:55.643 --> 17:56.508
Us too!

17:56.510 --> 18:01.180
Close to Campo Grande, and
I hear they got ten kegs.

18:01.182 --> 18:02.182
Cool

18:02.749 --> 18:04.650
so I'll see you there then.

18:04.652 --> 18:05.652
Guess so.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.755
What the hell!

18:09.757 --> 18:11.256
Sorry, I panicked.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.258
It's cool, we got what we
needed.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.127
Fighting, courage to the core!

18:15.129 --> 18:16.628
Rock pride is mounting,

18:16.630 --> 18:18.430
S.R.U. Forever more!

18:19.232 --> 18:21.834
That is the slippery rock theme
song.

18:21.836 --> 18:24.503
Now Danny, you do have
to have an essay ready

18:24.505 --> 18:25.637
by Monday morning.

18:25.639 --> 18:26.572
Oh, I do.

18:26.574 --> 18:28.707
Yeah, nothing major, just...

18:28.709 --> 18:31.643
some crap about perseverance,
personal struggles,

18:31.645 --> 18:35.347
overcoming the odds,
they eat that shit up.

18:35.349 --> 18:37.282
Ah, trout camp!

18:37.284 --> 18:40.152
I'll whip up something so sad,

18:40.154 --> 18:41.687
they'll read it and
cry like they got their

18:41.689 --> 18:43.589
dicks caught in the escalator.

18:43.591 --> 18:45.691
Thank you so much Mr.
mulligan, that's awesome.

18:45.693 --> 18:49.795
I understand, there's
a lot of questions.

18:49.797 --> 18:51.630
I'll take care of them too.

18:51.632 --> 18:54.166
And try not to get into too much
trouble.

18:55.169 --> 18:56.301
Don't be fresh.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.736
Team is fighting...

18:57.738 --> 19:00.205
that guy is a freakazoid.

19:00.207 --> 19:01.340
Trout camp fuckers!

19:10.750 --> 19:12.584
You're listening to Phil from
the hill,

19:12.586 --> 19:18.891
and thank you for listening
to oil city's classic country.

19:23.197 --> 19:23.862
You're going to

19:23.864 --> 19:24.930
get me fired man!

19:24.932 --> 19:30.369
- Come on man, let's do this!
- Come on!

19:30.371 --> 19:32.271
Alright, let's go, watch the
door.

19:32.273 --> 19:33.272
There it is.

19:33.274 --> 19:34.173
Let's get you in here.

19:34.175 --> 19:34.873
Come on.

19:34.875 --> 19:36.441
Hey grandpa!

19:36.443 --> 19:37.309
How you doing?

19:37.311 --> 19:39.344
Ooh, watch the head.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.646
Okay.
Lock him up.

19:40.648 --> 19:42.814
I don't know about this dude.

19:42.816 --> 19:48.654
Let's just make sure he gets
back before family feud starts.

19:52.393 --> 19:54.626
Come on, move it.

19:54.628 --> 19:57.696
Take your wine cooler and
your porn and get out.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.730
Alright you're up.

19:58.732 --> 20:00.566
I'll get you next time.

20:00.568 --> 20:01.867
That's what you said last time.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.468
I'm a little short this month
okay.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.703
Oh boy!

20:04.705 --> 20:05.737
Alright, what do I owe you?

20:05.739 --> 20:10.275
And a box of these, yeah!

20:10.277 --> 20:10.943
It's tradition!

20:10.945 --> 20:12.778
Tradition, you're making up
traditions.

20:12.780 --> 20:15.347
Every time I pay, you
make up a tradition.

20:15.349 --> 20:16.415
No, I'm not.

20:17.818 --> 20:19.284
What's going on?

20:19.286 --> 20:23.589
Oh, we're out of quarters, and
dimes.

20:23.591 --> 20:25.691
It's money, let's get going.

20:25.693 --> 20:27.392
I want to get out there
before those pissants

20:27.394 --> 20:28.560
take the best spots.

20:28.562 --> 20:30.295
Well, at least you could take
the box.

20:30.297 --> 20:34.833
"My sciatica, my everything,
my back."

20:34.835 --> 20:35.701
Shut up!

20:35.703 --> 20:37.836
Mom likes me best.

20:40.307 --> 20:42.307
Anything else grandpa?

20:44.477 --> 20:45.911
Okay, I guess that'll do it.

20:45.913 --> 20:49.514
Hang on, the old man didn't
say a word.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.718
That's coz the Japs
ripped out his vocal cords

20:52.720 --> 20:54.886
with a bayonet at the battle of
the bulge.

20:54.888 --> 20:56.388
He drinks to forget about it,

20:56.390 --> 20:58.857
but thanks for bringing it up.

21:00.827 --> 21:02.294
Wait a minute.

21:02.296 --> 21:05.264
The battle of the bulge was in
Europe.

21:05.266 --> 21:07.599
You want to tell him that?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.839
Thank you for your service.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.408
This way.

21:16.410 --> 21:18.043
Grandpa just got us beer,

21:18.045 --> 21:19.978
and he doesn't know what year it
is.

21:19.980 --> 21:24.383
Okay, always great
hanging out with you grandpa.

21:30.491 --> 21:32.391
Come on grandpa!

21:32.393 --> 21:35.327
We'll see you next time grandpa!

21:36.829 --> 21:38.430
Oh my god, who farted?

21:38.432 --> 21:41.300
Oh, I bet, I think grandpa
crop dusted.

21:41.302 --> 21:42.567
It's getting stronger!

21:42.569 --> 21:43.435
It's in my mouth.

21:43.437 --> 21:44.303

21:44.305 --> 21:45.305

21:46.307 --> 21:47.406

21:47.408 --> 21:48.408

21:49.976 --> 21:50.842
Let me out!

21:50.844 --> 21:51.710
Unlock the door Danny!

21:51.712 --> 21:53.512
Let me out!

21:53.514 --> 21:55.514
Why did we park so far away?

21:55.516 --> 21:58.317
He wanted me to park out
here, and use the back door.

21:58.319 --> 22:00.485
Okay, Danny, I need you to come
with me.

22:00.487 --> 22:01.787
He used to hang out
with your older brother.

22:01.789 --> 22:05.324
He might give us a better deal,
alright?

22:08.095 --> 22:10.362
I don't even know why we need
weed.

22:10.364 --> 22:11.830
It's habit forming, you know.

22:11.832 --> 22:14.833
I don't want to see you go down
that path.

22:14.835 --> 22:16.101
Shut up dude.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.574
He should be here.

22:23.509 --> 22:24.376
Yo!

22:24.378 --> 22:25.577
God!

22:25.579 --> 22:26.878
Who's this Hector?

22:26.880 --> 22:30.048
Relax man, it's Pete
Whitaker's brother, Danny.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.383
Is he an asshole like his
brother?

22:31.385 --> 22:32.718
Just let us inside.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.786
I wanna show Danny your doll
collection.

22:34.788 --> 22:37.589
Fuck you, those are my
mom's cabbage patch kids.

22:37.591 --> 22:39.024
Someone just stole Geneva Gina,

22:39.026 --> 22:40.092
and she almost killed me.

22:40.094 --> 22:41.360
Was that you?

22:41.362 --> 22:42.894
Um no, it wasn't.

22:44.430 --> 22:46.431

23:19.600 --> 23:22.467
You want to uh, roll a doob, or
chill out?

23:22.469 --> 23:23.902
Oh, it's alright, maybe some
other time.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.470

27:39.026 --> 27:41.259
Brought my poles and bait.

when you used dynamite,

27:43.130 --> 27:44.763

off.

27:44.765 --> 27:47.165

Anyone can throw a worm in the
water,

44:15.287 --> 44:16.954
the art's in catching it.

44:16.956 --> 44:18.088
The baby's mine.

44:18.090 --> 44:19.023
Bullshit.

44:19.025 --> 44:20.057
Whoa!

44:20.059 --> 44:22.760
We came here to party,
and have a good time,

44:22.762 --> 44:24.161
not fight over a fish alright.

44:24.163 --> 44:26.730
Why don't you just throw it
back.

44:26.732 --> 44:28.666
Let me think about that.

44:28.668 --> 44:30.034
Uh...

44:30.036 --> 44:32.670
The prize money will buy
me shit loads of bacon,

44:32.672 --> 44:35.906
Jesus, is pot the only
thing you care about?

44:35.908 --> 44:37.041
Pot and pussy.

44:37.043 --> 44:38.308
You little douche bag!

44:38.310 --> 44:39.977
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

44:39.979 --> 44:41.078
Hey ladies!

44:41.080 --> 44:43.681
Take a look at my huge trout!

44:44.315 --> 44:46.383
Yuck, why do they hang out
with him?

44:46.385 --> 44:48.819
Because, he's never without
weed.

44:48.821 --> 44:50.888
So, they would rather get high
with him,

44:50.890 --> 44:52.756
than hook up with us?

44:58.464 --> 45:01.265
Come on, toughen up you pussy!

45:03.001 --> 45:06.837
Hah, hey guess how you
order steak in France?

45:06.839 --> 45:09.206
Oh, don't know, don't care.

45:09.208 --> 45:10.941
Biftek et frites!

45:11.877 --> 45:14.912
You're going to need to
learn when we go to Paris.

45:14.914 --> 45:16.380
Oh honey, look, hey,

45:16.382 --> 45:19.016
you wanna know a place that's
romantic,

45:19.018 --> 45:20.150
Niagra falls.

45:20.152 --> 45:24.088
Yeah, those Canadians, they
put all their signs in French.

45:24.090 --> 45:25.355
That's not romantic.

45:25.357 --> 45:28.092
How about Atlantic city?

45:28.094 --> 45:30.728
Honey, very romantic.

45:30.730 --> 45:33.831
You know Bobby Vinton
plays there all the time.

45:33.833 --> 45:35.899
Oh, you know, you know...

45:36.835 --> 45:37.935
roses are r...

45:37.937 --> 45:39.336
don't you dare.

45:41.039 --> 45:43.240
24 years you have been promising
me.

45:43.242 --> 45:46.276
Now I have clipped coupons,
and bought store brand.

45:46.278 --> 45:50.013
I have sold Tupperware,
and Mary Kaye and Avon,

45:50.015 --> 45:51.749
which is a conflict of interest,

45:51.751 --> 45:55.152
I have skimped on nail
salons and hair salons

45:55.154 --> 45:57.087
and dry cleaning to save money.

45:57.089 --> 45:58.489
You are taking me

46:00.058 --> 46:01.058
to Paris!

46:02.227 --> 46:03.427
Okay, I'm taking you to par...

46:03.429 --> 46:05.262
honey, I'm just kidding around.

46:05.264 --> 46:07.231
Honey, come on, honey, come on.

46:07.233 --> 46:08.098
I'm taking...

46:08.100 --> 46:10.033
hey Bruce, Caroline.

46:10.902 --> 46:13.537
Hey, bonjour Mike,
you're not on duty today?

46:13.539 --> 46:15.773
No, I was, I worked a double.

46:15.775 --> 46:18.909
Hey there Pete, haven't
seen you in awhile.

46:18.911 --> 46:21.078
No, you have not.

46:21.080 --> 46:22.279
So anyway, Bruce.

46:22.281 --> 46:24.782
Its none of my business, but
last night

46:24.784 --> 46:27.985
I broke up an underage
drinking party at trout camp,

46:27.987 --> 46:29.553
and Danny was there.

46:30.422 --> 46:31.421
Busted!

46:31.423 --> 46:33.323
Hey, shut it.

46:33.325 --> 46:34.792
Danny's not at trout camp,

46:34.794 --> 46:36.293
he's helping a friend in
Pleasantville.

46:36.295 --> 46:38.228
Oh no, he was, I saw
him with my own eyes.

46:38.230 --> 46:39.229
Are you sure?

46:39.231 --> 46:40.164
Yeah, I was this close to him.

46:40.166 --> 46:41.365
I saw him.

46:41.367 --> 46:45.335
I think you must've mistook
some other kid for Danny.

46:45.337 --> 46:46.337
What?

46:49.841 --> 46:50.841
Oh, yeah.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.143
Maybe I did.

46:55.346 --> 46:57.147
See you guys around.

47:01.820 --> 47:02.853
Bruce, don't get carried...

47:02.855 --> 47:04.321
Caroline, don't.

47:13.431 --> 47:15.232
I can't believe stash
is going to win the money.

47:15.234 --> 47:17.034
Maybe someone will catch a
bigger one.

47:17.036 --> 47:18.335
No way!

47:18.337 --> 47:20.504
I don't care, let that ass wipe
win.

47:20.506 --> 47:23.140
Buy all the weed he can get
his douche bag hands on,

47:23.142 --> 47:25.943
and smoke himself into a pot
induced coma.

47:25.945 --> 47:28.879
Well, as long as you don't care.

47:33.018 --> 47:35.052
Wow, so your counselor tells you

47:35.054 --> 47:36.486
he can get you into slippery
rock,

47:36.488 --> 47:39.923
the same day your dad
gets you into Bridgetown?

47:39.925 --> 47:43.293
You gotta be totally stressed
out.

47:43.295 --> 47:44.928
I just don't get how
people can expect you to make

47:44.930 --> 47:48.866
a decision at 18 that
affects your whole life.

47:49.634 --> 47:53.103
My parents were convinced
I'd become a doctor.

47:53.105 --> 47:56.240
I told my dad that I
wanted to study sociology,

47:56.242 --> 47:58.208
and back pack through Europe,

47:58.210 --> 48:00.110
and he threw up.

48:00.112 --> 48:03.013
Literally, mashed potatoes
all over my mother.

48:04.250 --> 48:05.582
It was classic.

48:05.584 --> 48:07.384
It's pretty funny.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.622
What made you want to study
sociology?

48:11.624 --> 48:13.624
I knew I wanted to
help people in some way,

48:13.626 --> 48:18.262
but I just couldn't stomach
pre-med, and all that blood.

48:18.264 --> 48:20.397
You did a pretty good
job patching me up.

48:20.399 --> 48:22.432
Well, you're lucky it wasn't
any worse.

48:22.434 --> 48:25.502
I would have left you for the
bears.

48:33.612 --> 48:35.479
Just look at 'em.

48:35.481 --> 48:36.481
Huh?

48:38.082 --> 48:40.350
They are so flirting with us.

48:40.352 --> 48:42.586
Acting like they're not paying
attention.

48:42.588 --> 48:45.022
Wait, how do you know they're
acting?

48:45.024 --> 48:47.357
Because it's what they do.

48:50.095 --> 48:52.996
Just make them think we're
ignoring them.

48:52.998 --> 48:54.665
I am ignoring them.

48:57.603 --> 48:59.603
Me catching that fish
turned the little one on.

48:59.605 --> 49:01.972
Then why don't they come over
here?

49:01.974 --> 49:04.374
'Cause then we'd think they're
easy.

49:04.376 --> 49:06.543
Wait so, they wanna come over
here,

49:06.545 --> 49:09.413
because they're easy, but
they won't come over here

49:09.415 --> 49:12.449
because they don't us
to know they're easy.

49:12.451 --> 49:15.519
Ding-ding, circle gets the
square.

49:17.523 --> 49:19.356
But don't you guys worry.

49:19.358 --> 49:23.126
I'm going to figure out a
way to get 'em over here.

49:27.366 --> 49:30.334
Bruce, I don't think
this is a good idea.

49:30.336 --> 49:31.468
Pete!

49:31.470 --> 49:32.470
Let's go!

49:41.980 --> 49:44.681
So um, what's Pittsburgh like?

49:44.683 --> 49:46.183
Oh, I love it.

49:46.185 --> 49:49.052
My place is on Southside, near
Jack's bar.

49:49.054 --> 49:51.421
Carson street is so much fun.

49:51.423 --> 49:52.622
I've only been to Pittsburgh
once,

49:52.624 --> 49:55.125
for like a class trip to the
zoo.

49:55.127 --> 49:56.760
Well, you should check
it out this summer.

49:56.762 --> 49:58.628
I'd like that, for sure.

49:58.630 --> 50:01.031
Um, I gotta figure out
what I'm doing first,

50:01.033 --> 50:03.467
'cause there's a good
chance I might be working.

50:03.469 --> 50:05.669
So, slippery rock's out?

50:07.271 --> 50:08.372
I don't know,

50:08.374 --> 50:09.306
I mean uh,

50:09.308 --> 50:13.010
you know, going to
college would be a blast,

50:13.012 --> 50:16.646
but working at Bridgetown
would mean a lot to my dad.

50:16.648 --> 50:20.050
You know it's like a family
tradition.

50:20.785 --> 50:23.420
Um, life's a puzzle.

50:23.422 --> 50:25.288
Make sure you don't try to force
pieces

50:25.290 --> 50:27.157
where they don't fit.

50:30.228 --> 50:32.095
You know if sociology doesn't
work out,

50:32.097 --> 50:35.032
you should definitely try
being a guidance counselor.

50:37.569 --> 50:39.069
I'm getting tired.

50:39.071 --> 50:40.504
I'm trying here.

50:40.506 --> 50:42.472
Just get it up already.

50:42.474 --> 50:45.642
This has never
happened to me before.

50:45.644 --> 50:47.177
I think I heard something.

50:47.179 --> 50:48.378
It's probably a bear or
something.

50:48.380 --> 50:49.780
What!

50:49.782 --> 50:50.782
Bobby!

50:51.682 --> 50:52.682
Oh Bobby!

50:54.352 --> 50:57.187
Bobby, thank god, I'm lost.

50:57.189 --> 50:58.388
You have any Colamine Lotion.

50:58.390 --> 51:00.524
I got poison Ivy on my balls.

51:00.526 --> 51:03.794
Listen, Mr. M., I'm a little
busy here.

51:03.796 --> 51:09.366
Listen, Mr. M., why don't
you go way over there?

51:11.102 --> 51:12.369
Get outta here.

51:16.574 --> 51:17.574
Fucker.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.080
Pete!

51:26.685 --> 51:27.685
Come on!

51:29.654 --> 51:31.455
This is so cool.

51:31.457 --> 51:34.224
We haven't been hunting together
in years.

51:34.226 --> 51:35.592
We're not hunting.

51:35.594 --> 51:38.361
We're hunting for Danny's ass.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.603
You guys haven't lured
them over here yet?

51:46.605 --> 51:48.638
They're never coming
over here with you around.

51:48.640 --> 51:50.207
Men and women are meant to be
together.

51:50.209 --> 51:51.541
Maybe not this time.

51:51.543 --> 51:52.543
Bullshit.

51:54.213 --> 51:58.815
And the apple, and the snake,
and the...

52:02.654 --> 52:03.654
I got it!

52:04.555 --> 52:06.223
I got it!

52:18.169 --> 52:20.337
What, wait, wait, I'm not
finished.

52:20.339 --> 52:23.807
Danny, you're really talented.

52:23.809 --> 52:27.444
Oh, thanks, I mean, it's just
a hobby.

52:27.446 --> 52:30.413
Collecting beer cans is a hobby.

52:30.415 --> 52:33.216
You should really think
about becoming an artist.

52:33.218 --> 52:36.887
Yeah, that would go over
real well in my house.

52:36.889 --> 52:39.189
These are awesome.

52:39.191 --> 52:41.324
Have your parents seen your
work.

52:41.326 --> 52:45.262
Um, you know, not
really, just a few things.

52:47.899 --> 52:50.934
You can't take that job at
Bridgetown.

52:50.936 --> 52:51.935
Why not?

52:51.937 --> 52:54.738
Test, you're an artist.

52:54.740 --> 52:57.307
Yeah well, what kind of
job is an artist anyways.

52:57.309 --> 52:59.509
I mean, you know what, I'm
supposed to just give up

52:59.511 --> 53:01.878
a future and a paycheck to
paint supermarket murals?

53:01.880 --> 53:03.380
That is your dad talking.

53:03.382 --> 53:05.415
You have something special,

53:05.417 --> 53:07.217
and not very many people can say
that.

53:07.219 --> 53:10.220
I really appreciate the advice,

53:10.222 --> 53:14.858
what the hell to do
with my life right now.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.227
Okay.

53:17.229 --> 53:18.229
I'm sorry.

53:19.263 --> 53:20.830
It's none of my business.

53:20.832 --> 53:22.933
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

53:50.595 --> 53:51.595
Let's go.

54:01.239 --> 54:02.706
How you feeling?

54:03.507 --> 54:05.242
I'm coming around.

54:05.244 --> 54:07.544
Great, because it's time for
you to go.

54:07.546 --> 54:09.379
You've outstayed your welcome.

54:09.381 --> 54:11.648
You don't have to be rude Becca.

54:11.650 --> 54:14.351
This is a girls only weekend.

54:14.353 --> 54:15.485
Forget it.

54:15.487 --> 54:16.487
Great!

54:21.626 --> 54:22.692
She's pleasant.

54:22.694 --> 54:23.694
Sorry

54:32.536 --> 54:33.603
hey!

54:34.472 --> 54:35.338
Mr. Whitaker?

54:35.340 --> 54:37.974
What are you doing out here?

54:37.976 --> 54:40.043
Some of us actually came to
fish.

54:40.045 --> 54:41.678
Oh, catch anything?

54:41.680 --> 54:44.047
A few rainbow, but nothing much.

54:44.049 --> 54:45.448
Yeah, you seen Danny?

54:45.450 --> 54:46.449
Not around here.

54:46.451 --> 54:49.386
I don't, I don't think he came.

54:49.388 --> 54:50.920
Alright, thanks Ronnie.

54:50.922 --> 54:53.657
You guys fish, at trout camp.

54:54.959 --> 54:55.959
Dorks!

54:56.861 --> 54:58.461
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

54:58.463 --> 55:00.030
Oh my god stash, what
the hell are you doing?

55:00.032 --> 55:01.398
Don't worry,

55:01.400 --> 55:03.933
we're all getting laid tonight.

55:15.046 --> 55:16.046
Fire!

55:20.518 --> 55:21.651
I know you were trying to help,

55:21.653 --> 55:22.653
I'm just,

55:24.389 --> 55:27.991
figuring what I want to
do with my life right now.

55:27.993 --> 55:29.926
Well, sometime,

55:29.928 --> 55:31.828
when you're alone,

55:31.830 --> 55:34.531
I want you to close your
eyes, and try to picture

55:34.533 --> 55:36.466
how you imagine your future.

55:36.468 --> 55:39.369
Where you live, where you work.

55:39.371 --> 55:41.604
If you see yourself in oil city,

55:41.606 --> 55:43.073
hanging out with your friends,

55:43.075 --> 55:44.574
working at the plant,

55:44.576 --> 55:47.377
then maybe that's your answer.

55:47.379 --> 55:49.012
But, if you have trouble
imagining that,

55:49.014 --> 55:52.782
I think that's your heart
telling you that

55:52.784 --> 55:53.983
you need more.

55:56.053 --> 55:57.053
Wow

55:58.356 --> 55:59.422
that's deep.

56:00.691 --> 56:04.094
Alright, now let's get you
lost, again.

56:14.505 --> 56:15.872
Mr. mulligan?

56:15.874 --> 56:16.973
Pete?

56:16.975 --> 56:19.976

Go, go, go, go, go!

Stash, let's go!

01:00:23.622 --> 01:00:25.955
You're not the boss of me!

01:00:29.927 --> 01:00:31.227
Stash!

01:00:31.229 --> 01:00:33.129
No way, what's up man?

01:00:33.131 --> 01:00:34.131
It's Pete.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.369
We used to hang out all
the time in ninth grade.

01:00:39.371 --> 01:00:40.770
Which time?

01:00:40.772 --> 01:00:42.839
My first, your second.

01:00:44.875 --> 01:00:46.075
Oh yeah!

01:00:46.077 --> 01:00:47.143
Presto Pete?

01:00:47.145 --> 01:00:48.811
Hey, yeah man.

01:00:48.813 --> 01:00:51.180
You could smoke a
little joint with one hit.

01:00:51.182 --> 01:00:53.683
I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:00:53.685 --> 01:00:58.087
Jesus Christ, has anybody
seen my son, Danny Whitaker?

01:00:58.089 --> 01:00:59.288
Who's in there?

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:03.760
She's changing out of her
bathing suit.

01:01:03.762 --> 01:01:05.094
I just need to check real quick.

01:01:05.096 --> 01:01:07.230
Are you crazy?

01:01:07.232 --> 01:01:09.832
Alright, sorry for interrupting
girls.

01:01:09.834 --> 01:01:14.003
Yeah, like stash would hang
out with a dork like Danny.

01:01:14.005 --> 01:01:16.773
Hey, hey stash, can I, joint?

01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:17.740
For the road, out here, you
know.

01:01:17.742 --> 01:01:19.108
Pete!

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.176
Sorry man.

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:22.979
See you Pete.

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:35.892
Finally, it grew back.

01:01:37.295 --> 01:01:39.896
You can see that line right
there.

01:01:39.898 --> 01:01:40.763
I bet that hurt.

01:01:40.765 --> 01:01:41.431
It did.

01:01:41.433 --> 01:01:42.298
It did.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.067
Who's open for business?

01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.934
Excuse me?

01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:46.736
You're at trout camp.

01:01:46.738 --> 01:01:48.905
Every girl at trout camp is
looking

01:01:48.907 --> 01:01:50.339
for some tube steak, right?

01:01:50.341 --> 01:01:52.041
Oh my god, gross.

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:54.143
Shut up stash, you jerk.

01:01:54.145 --> 01:01:56.212
Whatever Scott.

01:01:56.214 --> 01:01:57.814
She's cross-eyed.

01:01:57.816 --> 01:01:58.816
Shut up!

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:03.920
God, this sucks!

01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:06.189
Hey, you guys wanna go for a
walk?

01:02:06.191 --> 01:02:07.790
Let's go.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.726
Where are you going?

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:12.028
It's your loss.

01:02:56.975 --> 01:02:59.142
Come sweetheart.

01:02:59.144 --> 01:03:00.343
Watch the teeth!

01:03:00.345 --> 01:03:01.345
Watch the teeth!

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:10.186
We've been to pit hole and back,

01:03:10.188 --> 01:03:12.054
where's this little shit hiding
at?

01:03:12.056 --> 01:03:14.824
Well, maybe he's not here.

01:03:14.826 --> 01:03:16.025
Yeah, right.

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:20.229
I mean yeah, maybe you're right.

01:03:20.231 --> 01:03:21.564
You know what.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:24.133
Let's call it.

01:03:24.135 --> 01:03:25.135
I'm beat.

01:03:33.544 --> 01:03:35.845
I thought I just heard my
dad's voice.

01:03:35.847 --> 01:03:36.847
Out here?

01:03:40.551 --> 01:03:42.819
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

01:03:42.821 --> 01:03:45.321
You do have some issues to
work out.

01:03:49.893 --> 01:03:52.061
Are you sure about this?

01:03:52.063 --> 01:03:54.163
It's pretty fucked
up, even for you Becca.

01:03:54.165 --> 01:03:55.898
Think about baby Moses,

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.568
being sent down the Nile, in a
basket.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.337
That was so Moses wouldn't get
killed.

01:04:01.339 --> 01:04:05.541
Exactly, so this asshole
should consider himself lucky.

01:04:12.483 --> 01:04:13.483
Allison?

01:05:04.903 --> 01:05:05.903
Oh god!

01:05:10.507 --> 01:05:11.507
Oh my god.

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:35.598
I know you took it you bastard!

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.366
I did not!

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.402
Yo guys!

01:05:39.404 --> 01:05:40.937
What's going on?

01:05:42.606 --> 01:05:45.341
Dude, where the hell have you
been?

01:05:45.343 --> 01:05:46.943
Long story man.

01:05:47.679 --> 01:05:49.946
He took my prize winning trout.

01:05:49.948 --> 01:05:52.949
Alright, alright, alright!

01:05:52.951 --> 01:05:55.618
Now, he's
going to call me a liar.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.520
Listen, if you don't
want the whole town to know

01:05:57.522 --> 01:06:00.222
that your latest girlfriend
had a set of gills...

01:06:00.224 --> 01:06:02.158
I'm going to bury this asshole.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.626
Yeah?

01:06:03.628 --> 01:06:05.561
I suggest you drop it.

01:06:12.704 --> 01:06:13.704
Dude,

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:16.672
look dude, your dad and Pete
were out here last night

01:06:16.674 --> 01:06:17.540
looking for you.

01:06:17.542 --> 01:06:21.110
Yeah, no one saw, we hid.

01:06:21.112 --> 01:06:22.144
We gotta get out of here.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:23.012
Now!

01:06:23.014 --> 01:06:26.749
Dude, seriously, where
the hell have you been?

01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:28.651
What if I told you,
when I ran from the cops,

01:06:28.653 --> 01:06:30.486
I actually found goddess camp?

01:06:30.488 --> 01:06:32.388
So you were tripping on
mushrooms.

01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:34.023
Yeah, that's what I'd say too.

01:06:34.025 --> 01:06:36.559
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:39.095
No

01:06:39.097 --> 01:06:44.300
like the way he always goes,
"what?"

01:06:46.003 --> 01:06:47.003
No

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.510
dude.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:57.079
It wasn't what it looked like.

01:06:57.081 --> 01:06:58.514
Yeah, what the hell
was your dick in a fish

01:06:58.516 --> 01:07:01.650
sometimes it's hard being the
cool dude

01:07:01.652 --> 01:07:03.753
that everyone wants to hang
around with.

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:07.123
I mean when the party's over,
I'm alone.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:08.324
Alright, look stash, it's
alright.

01:07:08.326 --> 01:07:09.658
It's not fair!

01:07:10.594 --> 01:07:12.428
I'm the one who got those girls
over here,

01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:14.330
and they're the ones who got
laid.

01:07:14.332 --> 01:07:15.598
And now my reputation's ruined

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.665
'cause of one weak moment.

01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:18.267
Listen, listen.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.703
It's alright.

01:07:20.705 --> 01:07:23.572
Okay, I'm not going to tell
anyone.

01:07:23.574 --> 01:07:24.540
Really?

01:07:24.542 --> 01:07:25.542
Yeah

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:29.545
swear to god?

01:07:29.547 --> 01:07:30.780
I swear.

01:07:30.782 --> 01:07:31.647
Alright?

01:07:31.649 --> 01:07:32.515
Now, come on.

01:07:32.517 --> 01:07:34.483
Let's pack up, alright?

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.820
All I got is the shirt on my
back,

01:07:37.822 --> 01:07:38.687
and the weed in my pocket.

01:07:38.689 --> 01:07:39.555
Let's go!

01:07:39.557 --> 01:07:40.557
Man, let's go.

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:49.065
So...

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.400
Can I call you?

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:53.502
I guess so.

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.475
I think I have a pen.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:03.479
Voila.

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:06.215
Okay, ready?

01:08:06.217 --> 01:08:07.850
Go for it.

01:08:07.852 --> 01:08:09.452
Eight six seven

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:13.556
five three oh nine

01:08:17.795 --> 01:08:18.795
good one Jenny.

01:08:20.098 --> 01:08:21.296
Three oh nine.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:25.868
Listen um, after graduation,

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:26.801
I'm going to college.

You don't know what he
sacrificed.

01:13:45.923 --> 01:13:48.991
Think he enjoys working
the night shift at his age?

01:13:48.993 --> 01:13:51.827
What's that got to do with
anything?

01:13:51.829 --> 01:13:53.962
He made a deal to work those
shifts,

01:13:53.964 --> 01:13:56.198
in exchange for you getting
hired.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.600

01:14:04.508 --> 01:14:08.710

that you're taken care of.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:11.747
Okay, get some rest.

You haven't been here

01:18:54.765 --> 01:18:56.765

No, it's not!

So what?

01:19:09.379 --> 01:19:11.213
It's not going to pay the bills.

Look, you...

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.985
Put this back on your head.

01:19:16.987 --> 01:19:19.121
Put it back on your
head, or I swear to god,

01:19:19.123 --> 01:19:24.059
this is going to be the
sorriest day of your life.

01:19:24.061 --> 01:19:25.827
I'm sorry dad.

01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:27.796
You went through a lot to get me
in here,

01:19:27.798 --> 01:19:30.866
and I appreciate it, okay, I
really do.

I just can't.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:42.244
You, hang on, you, wait a
minute.

01:19:42.246 --> 01:19:44.846
Alright you want to waste your
life?

01:19:44.848 --> 01:19:49.384
You're not getting a goddamn
cent from me.

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:57.559
Normally I get dinner and a
movie

01:19:57.561 --> 01:19:59.895
before I get fucked you little
shit.

01:19:59.897 --> 01:20:00.996
Look Mr. mulligan, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean...

01:20:00.998 --> 01:20:04.933
I didn't mean to screw
up at slippery rock.

01:20:04.935 --> 01:20:08.170
The whole time you're working
here.

01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:11.540
By the way, I'm not
working here, I just quit.

01:20:11.542 --> 01:20:13.008
What do you mean you quit?

01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:15.076
