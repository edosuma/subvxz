00:18.393 --> 00:19.728
[echoes of Danny's fight]

00:20.937 --> 00:21.813
[men grunting]

00:25.692 --> 00:27.193
[gunshots]

00:28.945 --> 00:30.321
[police siren echoing]

00:30.405 --> 00:31.406
[man screaming]

00:43.960 --> 00:44.794
Mmm.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.633
I didn't hear you come in last night.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.887
[Danny] I just got back a few minutes ago.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.434
[groans]

01:00.810 --> 01:02.353
Are you gonna come to bed?

01:02.979 --> 01:06.399
I'll get some rest
when this parley goes down.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.485
You okay?

01:11.529 --> 01:14.199
Oh. This, uh... It's not my blood.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.786
Tigers jumped a Hatchet gun shipment
and shot one of them.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.412
I had to take him to the emergency room.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.748
It was a mess.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.009
The Yangs are dragging their feet.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.679
[Colleen] Mrs. Yang got Mr. Yang

01:36.763 --> 01:39.474
to consider sitting at a table
with his mortal enemies.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.976
We can't force them to share plates.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.187
No...

01:45.355 --> 01:46.564
but I can strongly suggest it.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.443
Hmm. I'm not sure
that particular brand of might

01:50.527 --> 01:52.070
can make this situation right.

01:54.614 --> 01:58.326
Might can be a powerful deterrent
if used correctly.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.371
Yeah. It's a very slippery slope.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.290
A Triad war impacts this whole community.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.084
I know. I live here.

02:06.918 --> 02:09.129
All I'm doing is keeping an eye
on the hot spots.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.840
The territorial borders and the docks.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.466
Just until this parley goes down.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.927
Some problems get worse
when you punch at 'em.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.513
Woke up on the wrong side of bed
this morning?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.682
And you never went to bed. What's new on the Frank Choi front?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.147
We're gonna play that game, huh?

02:30.066 --> 02:32.569
Danny, we were talking
about you overreaching.

02:32.652 --> 02:35.196
Yeah, then I asked you something
I know is important to you.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.241
[scoffs] You did not.
You deflected from the issue.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.450
There is no issue.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.744
Danny, you have not been home in days.

02:42.537 --> 02:44.205
You barely sleep when you are home.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.293
How many times a night
you light that fist up? It's not just this parley. It's...

02:56.301 --> 03:00.138
ever since Matt Murdock asked you
to keep his torch burning.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.390
He told me to protect his city.

03:04.475 --> 03:05.518
There's no torch.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.313
[kettle whistling]

03:14.903 --> 03:17.655
This has nothing to do with the fact
that K'un-Lun is gone?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.782
That the Hand is gone?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.618
And without them,
the Iron Fist has no...

03:22.577 --> 03:23.953
clearly defined role?

03:27.749 --> 03:30.126
You build your identity
around this mantle,

03:30.210 --> 03:31.252
then the wind changes.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.754
If anyone gets that, it's me. I'm just trying to do what's right.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.561
I'm sorry. I just...

03:50.563 --> 03:52.023
[sighs] I worry about you.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.401
I'm okay.

03:57.111 --> 03:57.946
I promise.

04:03.034 --> 04:03.868
[sighs]

04:04.202 --> 04:06.287
That woman Mary called for you yesterday.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.206
When you were out.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.876
What did she want?

04:12.460 --> 04:14.045
I don't know. She hung up.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.257
Strange.

04:20.718 --> 04:21.552
[sighs]

04:21.803 --> 04:23.805
[theme music playing]

05:46.554 --> 05:47.597
[Ward] Suggestion...

05:47.847 --> 05:50.224
Aromatic candles, wall art...

05:51.100 --> 05:52.518
would do wonders in here.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.320
Thanks for your generosity.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.114
I'd like to talk about gratitude.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.784
How do we struggle with expressing it?

06:10.078 --> 06:10.912
Hey.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.706
What we say here stays here.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.416
That's an NA thing, yes?

06:16.250 --> 06:18.544
-This is a safe space.
-[Ward] Is it?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.797
Because I ran into my sister
a few nights ago,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.549
and somehow she knows
that I've been coming here.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.094
Did one of you go and tell her this?

06:27.970 --> 06:29.347
Thanks for sharing, Ward.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.142
As I mentioned before,

06:33.893 --> 06:35.228
I'd like to talk about gratitude.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.437
[Ward] Was it about the money?

06:36.521 --> 06:38.272
'Cause if one of you needed money,

06:38.356 --> 06:40.024
all you have to do is ask me.

06:40.608 --> 06:44.570
'Cause money
isn't one of my many, varied issues.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.656
I respect your privacy.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.324
I'd like you to respect mine.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.827
Why don't you respect the meeting
you're in right now?

06:50.910 --> 06:54.747
It's a simple question.
It's an easy answer.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.500
I won't be angry. I just wanna know.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.252
No one knows your sister, man.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.962
Carlos, it's cool.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.422
Let me.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.176
What was your sister's reaction
to the news that you were in recovery?

07:09.387 --> 07:11.722
You've got some unresolved issues
around your sister.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.182
[chuckles] Welcome to the club.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.145
What are you actually feeling right now?

07:17.895 --> 07:18.771
I feel...

07:19.230 --> 07:23.317
No. I know
that you're all a bunch of assholes.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.402
[indistinct chatter]

07:38.416 --> 07:40.501
Hey, we need to talk. Can you meet?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.255
Sure. Your place is fine.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.842
This group thing you're doin'...

07:49.427 --> 07:50.261
it's brave.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.430
[laughs]

07:52.513 --> 07:53.848
Work in progress.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.186
Point is, if someone told Joy
that I've been going to meetings,

07:58.269 --> 08:00.396
it could mean
that someone's coming for Rand.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.690
-So just ask her.
-I did.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.526
We haven't had a meaningful conversation
in months.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.278
[sighs] Man.

08:07.361 --> 08:11.741
I ran into her and her new
business partner at an art auction.

08:12.033 --> 08:12.950
What do you mean?

08:14.243 --> 08:15.369
She only just divested.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.289
Uh, a foreign investor, I think.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.999
You should've seen this little prick.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.461
Uh... Danton. No, David.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.171
No. Um...

08:26.047 --> 08:27.048
Dayvos.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.383
Davos?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.427
Wait, you know him?

08:31.511 --> 08:32.803
I grew up with him.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.725
I saw him a few nights ago.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.602
Did they say what kind of business?

08:40.645 --> 08:43.356
No. But whatever she's doing,

08:43.606 --> 08:45.149
this guy could know what it is.

08:45.233 --> 08:49.153
Is there any way that you can call him
and try and suss out what's going on?

08:49.237 --> 08:51.405
No, things are shaky between us.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.533
[sighs]

08:54.200 --> 08:55.910
Man. [sniffs]

08:57.745 --> 09:02.750
I wish we could just...
I don't know, get together, hash it out.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086
What world is that gonna happen in?

09:07.421 --> 09:08.256
Good point.

09:10.091 --> 09:10.925
No.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.469
I could be wrong.

09:14.262 --> 09:19.058
If you invite us... dinner, drinks...
here at your place,

09:19.559 --> 09:21.394
we talk it out.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.856
-We could do this tonight, even.
-Tonight?

09:26.107 --> 09:26.941
Mmm.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.735
I don't know, Ward, it's...
It's kinda late notice.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.655
I mean, I'd have to ask Colleen, as...

09:36.701 --> 09:38.786
-[imitates whiplash]
-[both laughing]

09:41.330 --> 09:43.666
Come on, man. Don't be a dick.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.257
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to put you and Colleen out.

09:51.841 --> 09:52.675
I mean...

09:53.134 --> 09:56.887
after everything that happened
with our father, we haven't even...

09:58.222 --> 10:00.141
We haven't even talked about it.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.437
I wouldn't even know where to start.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.399
[sighs] I'll ask.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.402
Thanks, man.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.071
I really appreciate that.

10:15.489 --> 10:16.324
Ooh.

10:16.407 --> 10:19.619
Uh, maybe we make it like I, like...

10:20.119 --> 10:21.495
turn up, like...

10:23.372 --> 10:24.373
coincidentally.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.334
No.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.379
[scoffs] Come on, it's underhanded.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.591
Especially when you're trying
to mend fences.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.469
She might not even turn up
if she knows I'm gonna be here.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.386
[scoffs]

10:37.470 --> 10:39.180
Come on, Danny. Do me a favor here.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.016
All right.

10:43.017 --> 10:44.352
I'll call you once the runway's clear.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.151
[cell phone vibrating]

10:55.071 --> 10:56.947
Hey. You good?

10:57.156 --> 10:59.075
Hey. Yeah. Um...

11:00.910 --> 11:04.914
[smacks lips] I was wondering if you'd
mind if we have some people over tonight.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.460
Kinda like a housewarming-type thing.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.836
Who were you thinking?

11:11.295 --> 11:15.174
Me, you, Joy, Ward and, uh, Davos.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.676
[laughs]

11:17.301 --> 11:20.346
Yeah, you, uh... You lost me at Davos.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.933
Apparently he and Joy
are in business together.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.268
Oh, yeah? What sort of business is that?

11:27.228 --> 11:28.521
We can ask them tonight, you know?

11:29.355 --> 11:30.606
Keep it super chill, though.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.692
You and Davos
aren't exactly in a good place.

11:32.775 --> 11:36.070
No, we're not,
but it'll be good to clear the air.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.782
So, you're going to cook, right?

11:40.032 --> 11:40.991
[chuckles]

11:41.075 --> 11:42.076
Yeah, nice try.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.036
We'll do it together. It'll be fun.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.454
This could be a good thing.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.124
A chance for us to slow down,
catch a breath.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.377
All right. I'll see you soon.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.753
Yeah. Bye.

12:02.972 --> 12:03.848
[grunts]

12:47.683 --> 12:48.684
[door creaks open]

12:53.314 --> 12:54.648
What the hell are you doing here?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.194
I got the same question.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.613
You following me?

13:00.696 --> 13:03.324
Maybe I wanted to see
what you were up to, is all.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.493
Now you have.

13:05.576 --> 13:08.704
And you've overstayed your welcome,
so please leave.

13:09.079 --> 13:10.706
Why are you snooping around Choi's place?

13:12.541 --> 13:13.834
You know Frank Choi?

13:14.794 --> 13:18.172
Me and Squad, we come in all the spots
that don't have alarms at night.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.841
Look for food, loose change. You know.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.513
Sometimes Frank would catch us,
give us an earful.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.516
He wouldn't like you putting
your feet on his throne.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.851
-This thing?
-Yeah.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.479
He'd bark if anyone
so much as looked at it.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.856
Said it was where he did
all of his best thinking.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.490
Dang. Half of whatever's in there is mine.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.802
It's no 1958 Cuvée Léonie, but...

14:05.427 --> 14:09.014
[chuckles] Two fingers
of Hennessy Paradis Impérial says...

14:09.390 --> 14:11.475
you put your money
where your mouth is.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.393
[Joy chuckles]

14:13.602 --> 14:15.521
I have to tell you
that I took this meeting

14:15.604 --> 14:17.565
because my lawyers advised me to.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.900
After the drubbing I took at Rand--

14:19.984 --> 14:23.070
The patent I wanna talk with you about
is not in the Rand portfolio.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.239
I took it with me when I left.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.325
I'm listening.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.247
[sighs]

14:33.330 --> 14:35.499
Your photovoltaic solar cell patent,

14:35.583 --> 14:38.669
it has the potential
to change the global economy.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.506
Now, I respect your expertise
at development and tech,

14:43.340 --> 14:46.677
and you respect my money
and my years of experience.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.012
It's a win-win.

14:48.095 --> 14:48.929
[chuckles softly]

14:54.059 --> 14:54.935
Give me a day...

14:56.729 --> 14:59.398
to have my engineers
look over the proposal.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.277
Production will still be a hurdle.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.029
There's a factory in New Jersey.

15:05.487 --> 15:09.283
The minute they get your schematics,
they can start production within the week.

15:12.953 --> 15:13.954
All right.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.837
Just give me a call
when you're ready to get rolling.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.881
I haven't said yes yet.

15:24.882 --> 15:25.716
You will. [sighs]

15:40.898 --> 15:41.899
[knocking at door] Hey.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.782
The woman I passed in the hall...

15:49.865 --> 15:51.158
Sofia Rios.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.370
I'm looking to partner with her
on a business proposition.

15:55.913 --> 15:59.875
You know, at home in K'un-Lun,
I studied the tactics of Sun Tzu,

16:00.292 --> 16:03.420
Hammurabi, Khālid ibn al-Walīd...

16:03.712 --> 16:06.048
Somehow skipped the teachings
of Dale Carnegie.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.301
You misunderstood.

16:09.593 --> 16:11.553
I actually meant it as a compliment.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.892
In our dealings, you present strength.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.436
You ask no quarter, give no ground.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.188
You see victory in your mind's eye,

16:22.147 --> 16:23.941
and you make it real. I respect that.

16:24.692 --> 16:25.526
Well, I have plans.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.112
For when this business with Danny is done.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.698
Which is why I asked you over.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.411
Danny called earlier and invited us
to dinner at his place tonight.

16:37.079 --> 16:38.455
How would he know we know each--

16:38.539 --> 16:39.957
He ran into Ward at the auction.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.084
He must've said something.

16:43.877 --> 16:44.837
We have to go.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.548
They're obviously
suspicious of our friendship.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.134
Well, let them be.
We'll be done with them soon enough.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.179
Yeah, I didn't go to war school,

16:54.263 --> 16:58.017
but I have an MBA and I know
a little something about assessing risk.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.478
It will benefit us both
if we convince Danny we're his friends.

17:02.938 --> 17:08.360
I can't have him or Ward digging too deep
into my divestment paperwork.

17:08.819 --> 17:09.820
Joy.

17:14.783 --> 17:16.744
He won't suspect anything.

17:17.995 --> 17:21.081
And this dinner...
maybe it's just that.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.458
A dinner.

17:24.376 --> 17:25.794
Dinner's never just dinner.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.677
Figure out what it says?

17:34.678 --> 17:37.264
Nope. I mean, it's a list of some sort,

17:37.347 --> 17:39.475
and these are numbers,
but that's about it.

17:39.933 --> 17:40.768
Can you read it?

17:41.477 --> 17:43.062
I don't know enough Chinese for this.

17:44.021 --> 17:44.980
Well, it doesn't matter.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.107
That dude's either dead or gonna be dead.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.401
Why do you say that?

17:49.777 --> 17:50.944
Snitches get stitches.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.739
You think the police have him in custody?

17:56.241 --> 17:58.202
His cousin told me he owed the Tigers.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.204
Nah, he always pays on time.

18:01.288 --> 18:02.706
Okay, and you know this how?

18:03.749 --> 18:05.834
Me and Squad. We know everything.

18:06.585 --> 18:09.379
What information could he have
that the police would want?

18:10.297 --> 18:12.216
I don't know. Something they don't know.

18:13.008 --> 18:13.842
Oh, wow.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.303
That was profound.
Thank you for that, Sherlock.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.764
That's a stupid-sounding name.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.974
Really, BB? Really?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.727
All right, I'mma go.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.187
Give me my money.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.400
Next time you follow me,
you follow me to Bayard Street.

18:32.027 --> 18:34.238
Lady, you've got nice legs.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.616
But bullshit walks, money talks.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.574
[gasping and panting]

19:20.325 --> 19:21.368
Mary?

19:24.830 --> 19:26.748
Hey! Hey, Mary!

19:27.082 --> 19:27.958
Excuse me!

19:28.208 --> 19:29.626
-Mary, wait up!
-No.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.754
Mary, slow down! Mary!

19:34.631 --> 19:36.175
I'm sorry. I didn't expect to see you.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.802
I thought you'd be at work
and that I'd leave it and go.

19:38.886 --> 19:39.803
What is this?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.805
I should have told you about it
when we first met,

19:41.889 --> 19:42.848
but I got nervous.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.519
Please don't. Just leave it.
I should throw it away.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.730
Colleen said you called
and then you hung up.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.273
What's going on?

19:52.357 --> 19:54.151
Well, you know...

19:55.485 --> 19:58.322
You were so kind to me from the get-go.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.115
A total stranger.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.159
Then we bumped into each other again.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.412
And I can't remember the last time
I walked down the street with a great guy

20:05.495 --> 20:07.706
and talked about the weather and the city.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.959
And am I so wrong to think
that some things happen for a reason?

20:11.793 --> 20:13.921
Just that certain meetings are auspicious.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.798
Not in a horoscope,
tarot card kind of way.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.177
Just a feeling.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.306
And it's been so long

20:24.389 --> 20:26.350
since I've allowed myself
to have one of those,

20:27.184 --> 20:28.852
or even to leave the house at all.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.564
-You leave this at my door...
-I know.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.859
...you run away... [stammers]
and now you don't want me to open it?

20:35.943 --> 20:37.319
I really have to go.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.072
Mary, what's going on?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.117
-Are you in trouble?
-You could say that.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.745
So tell me about it.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.627
Someone is watching you.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.129
Who?

20:57.506 --> 20:58.507
Who's watching me?

20:59.675 --> 21:03.178
Someone called Walker.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.723
Who's Walker?

21:07.766 --> 21:08.600
Go ahead.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.081
[Colleen] Damn.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.208
So, wait. Mary isn't an artist,

21:33.292 --> 21:34.835
she's a private investigator?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.629
I mean, she said someone took these.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.090
Someone called Walker.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.884
It doesn't make sense
that she'd give these to you.

21:44.011 --> 21:46.430
I don't like that she was here, you know?

21:47.514 --> 21:50.976
What if she took something
or installed webcams?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.145
She doesn't really seem like the type.

21:54.855 --> 21:55.897
Why do you say that?

21:56.565 --> 21:59.735
I don't know.
She just seemed genuinely frightened.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.779
Or a genuinely good actor.

22:04.948 --> 22:07.701
A wolf in sheep's clothing
is the one you have to fear the most.

22:10.495 --> 22:13.206
We should cancel the dinner,
just figure this out.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.291
[Danny] No, come on.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.876
This is probably just a...

22:16.209 --> 22:17.961
a Rand thing, you know?

22:19.087 --> 22:22.716
Someone trying to land a story
how I'm moving boxes. [chuckles]

22:24.217 --> 22:25.052
Maybe.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.387
Or someone's trying to kill us.

22:29.181 --> 22:30.015
[chuckles]

22:30.599 --> 22:32.059
Look, I made a promise to Ward.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.644
He needs us to help figure out
this stuff with Joy.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.480
We can't do it another night?

22:36.897 --> 22:37.981
Yeah, but...

22:40.275 --> 22:41.860
Something you said this morning, it...

22:42.819 --> 22:44.029
it really stuck with me.

22:45.614 --> 22:47.240
I've been pushing so hard recently,

22:47.324 --> 22:48.825
especially with this parley looming.

22:50.285 --> 22:51.828
I could use a night off the streets.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.084
It is always something, I guess.

22:59.169 --> 23:00.545
That's the life we chose.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.466
It seems that way.

23:13.308 --> 23:16.353
Okay, would you put these
over on the table?

23:16.686 --> 23:18.063
These are practically dead.

23:18.397 --> 23:19.648
These are all we've got.

23:24.111 --> 23:24.945
[sighs]

23:27.697 --> 23:29.324
Danny, what do you want out of this?

23:30.242 --> 23:33.370
Well, I wanna find out
what's going on with Joy and Davos.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.998
But I just want it to be good with us.

23:39.626 --> 23:41.128
All of us, you know?

23:45.841 --> 23:47.259
Did you ask Ward to bring dessert?

23:47.968 --> 23:49.511
Yeah, I called, but he didn't pick up.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.512
I left a message.

23:52.514 --> 23:53.515
Oh...

23:54.182 --> 23:58.019
Hey, um, if Joy gets here before Ward,

23:58.812 --> 24:00.647
she can't know he's coming. Okay?

24:04.818 --> 24:06.403
Why would you not tell her that?

24:08.780 --> 24:12.617
He just thought that she wouldn't turn up
if she knew he was here, so...

24:13.243 --> 24:16.079
Oh, my God. That is ridiculous.
[stammers] So we just...

24:16.163 --> 24:17.164
[knocking at door]

24:18.039 --> 24:19.207
Um, roll with it.

24:19.666 --> 24:23.378
-Try and have some fun.
-That idea just went out of the window.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.631
-Hey! Joy, come in.
-Hi.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.635
-Hi. Good to see you. Hello.
-Danny.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.554
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.764
-Colleen.
-Davos.

24:36.183 --> 24:37.184
Thanks for coming.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.852
Make yourselves at home.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.061
Thanks.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.195
[chuckles]

24:49.112 --> 24:50.280
Thank you for the invitation.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.744
Yeah. You wanna put your coat
on the couch? Or...

24:56.870 --> 24:57.954
[Joy] Oh. Uh...

24:58.038 --> 25:00.290
-Yes. Just... yeah? Okay.
-[Colleen] Yeah.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.208
Just throw it over?

25:01.708 --> 25:03.210
[clears throat] Wow.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.089
So far, so good.

25:08.381 --> 25:10.383
A strong-willed woman
dating an arrogant prick.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.177
It's not the hardest sell in this town.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.097
[Joy] Is it this place...?

25:17.140 --> 25:19.309
This was a karate school
when I was last here.

25:19.893 --> 25:20.769
Who did all the work?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.605
Uh... We did. [chuckles]

25:24.397 --> 25:28.527
[exclaims] It is so nice, you guys.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.070
And I love the neighborhood.

25:30.362 --> 25:32.531
I hardly ever get to come this far east.

25:32.614 --> 25:33.448
[chokes]

25:34.449 --> 25:38.328
So, how do you guys even...
know each other anyway?

25:42.457 --> 25:43.708
We're just curious.

25:44.543 --> 25:46.711
But first, do you guys want wine? Water?

25:46.795 --> 25:50.006
-Uh, wine, yes. Thank you.
-Thank you.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.050
Well...

25:53.760 --> 25:55.387
Can you believe we met in Paris?

25:56.179 --> 25:58.932
I was on a little bit
of a go-find-myself break.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.977
-And, Davos, you were...
-I was on my way back from Tibet.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.521
[Joy] It was just a really crazy moment.

26:04.604 --> 26:05.939
Talk about a coincidence.

26:06.022 --> 26:08.233
It's kismet, you know? Six degrees.

26:08.608 --> 26:09.609
Call it what you will.

26:10.026 --> 26:14.656
I was standing there waiting for a table
at this little place on Saint-Germain.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.492
-And you...
-I was walking down the street,

26:17.576 --> 26:20.245
and I heard this maître d'
call out, "Madame Meachum."

26:20.328 --> 26:21.162
[laughs]

26:21.246 --> 26:24.583
I recognized her from when we met
at her father's apartment.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.502
So he comes over to my table.
He is so polite.

26:28.044 --> 26:28.962
You just...

26:29.421 --> 26:34.467
I mean, as crazy as it sounds,
'cause although we grew up worlds apart,

26:35.302 --> 26:37.679
we have many common interests.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.264
Yeah. [Danny grunts]

26:42.309 --> 26:43.143
Wow.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.730
The universe. [chuckles] There you go.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.189
It's big. [laughs]

26:48.648 --> 26:50.275
But it's really cozy sometimes.

26:51.026 --> 26:55.322
Hey, uh, Davos, I got a grill out back
if you wanna give me a hand.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.032
Yeah.

26:59.701 --> 27:02.704
-Joy, step into my lab.
-Okay.

27:08.168 --> 27:09.294
About the other night...

27:10.128 --> 27:12.047
You know I've always had a temper, Danny.

27:13.757 --> 27:17.385
I remember when Lei Kung would tell us
the best way to work on our anger

27:17.927 --> 27:19.846
was to break rocks with our bare hands.

27:19.929 --> 27:23.850
You know, I broke my wrist in two places
trying to smash that one piece of slate.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.772
Sometimes Colleen will tell me
to throw on a jacket.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.358
She doesn't realize
how used to the cold I got.

27:31.858 --> 27:34.694
Well, no one can understand K'un-Lun
if they haven't lived it.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.697
No, they can't.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.534
You're the only one
who knows what we went through.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.246
Yeah. In that way, we are alike.

27:46.623 --> 27:49.709
Danny, what are those?

27:52.837 --> 27:55.715
They're meatballs. They're for the pasta.

27:58.426 --> 28:00.178
And this is how they are prepared?

28:00.512 --> 28:04.766
[chuckles] Yeah.
I mean, it's how I prepare them.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.686
Fine.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.363
And that little trick means what exactly?

28:19.322 --> 28:20.240
Chefs do it.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.534
As they do.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.791
You know, I never would have taken you
for the domestic type.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.293
I'm not.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.172
I would've called in a catering company.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.009
Yeah. Uh, Danny really wanted to cook.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.845
I think it was a matter of pride.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.514
You guys are our first
real house guests, so...

28:45.682 --> 28:49.436
And what was it
that inspired him to do this anyway?

28:51.146 --> 28:51.980
Uh...

28:52.939 --> 28:54.315
He hadn't seen you in so long.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.276
And then you guys had that meeting...

28:57.193 --> 28:59.195
Of course. Of course. The meeting.

29:00.113 --> 29:01.114
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

29:01.197 --> 29:03.783
And Davos stopped by a few nights ago,

29:03.867 --> 29:05.910
so I think you're just fresh in his mind.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.038
Right. That's right.
Yeah, that makes sense.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.332
[Colleen chuckles nervously]

29:11.416 --> 29:13.668
So, I think these might be
a little overdone.

29:15.545 --> 29:16.880
I have an in at il Buco.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.174
I can have 'em rush over something.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.176
No, no. It's fine.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.345
All right. Well, I'll leave you to it.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.476
How'd it go?

29:30.602 --> 29:31.436
The usual.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.688
If Joy makes one more domestic crack,

29:34.522 --> 29:35.815
-I'm gonna deck her.
-[chuckles]

29:36.900 --> 29:38.693
Should we hold off until Ward gets here?

29:38.943 --> 29:40.528
I just called him again.
He didn't pick up.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.864
Let's just hope he's on his way.

29:45.033 --> 29:49.913
Awareness, acceptance, action.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.291
-Okay, I'm good.
-I'm sorry. What was that?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.627
[deep breath]

29:55.710 --> 29:58.671
Nothing. Um... I'll call you
when I need you.

29:59.255 --> 30:03.009
-I could take you up to the front door.
-No, I could use the air.

30:11.017 --> 30:12.101
[grunting]

30:15.688 --> 30:17.440
Everything okay, Mr. Meachum?

30:18.066 --> 30:19.526
Uh, 83rd and 3rd.

30:27.075 --> 30:29.035
[Joy sighs] Mmm.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.203
[Danny clears throat]

30:30.662 --> 30:31.871
[Colleen clears throat]

30:32.914 --> 30:34.165
Well, it's, um...

30:34.958 --> 30:37.919
it's nice to have you guys over,
break in the new place.

30:39.587 --> 30:40.964
-Cheers.
-Cheers to that.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.590
-[Colleen] Hmm.
-[Joy] Mmm-hmm.

30:46.678 --> 30:47.887
[Danny clears throat]

30:50.098 --> 30:53.393
So, Davos, K'un-Lun to New York

30:54.018 --> 30:55.603
has to be quite an adjustment.

30:56.563 --> 30:59.023
I look at any adversity
as a welcome challenge.

31:02.151 --> 31:03.862
So what are you doing
with your spare time?

31:04.946 --> 31:07.615
Besides, uh, shopping for antiquities?

31:09.158 --> 31:13.037
Well, I'm just exploring opportunities
as they arise.

31:19.919 --> 31:20.753
Wow.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.964
And you, Joy? What are you up to?

31:24.757 --> 31:25.592
[chuckles]

31:25.675 --> 31:28.720
Yeah. What's going on
with that divestment money?

31:29.512 --> 31:33.516
Well, I'd rather not talk about it
in front of the competition. [chuckles]

31:34.267 --> 31:38.688
I mean, unless you two...
wanna sign an NDA. [chuckles]

31:39.939 --> 31:42.609
-[scoffs] I'll sign whatever.
-[chuckles]

31:45.111 --> 31:45.945
Mmm.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.072
Mmm-hmm.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.490
-Mmm-mmm.
-Mmm. Mmm.

31:53.286 --> 31:57.498
So, I take it from the redecoration
you're not teaching anymore?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.544
No, uh... I'm not.

32:01.628 --> 32:03.630
Mmm. That is too bad.

32:05.089 --> 32:09.844
I had so many teachers
that were so influential in my life.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.680
Well, maybe it's for the best.

32:14.974 --> 32:16.267
What's that supposed to mean?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.186
[exhales]

32:19.228 --> 32:20.813
A teacher lives by example.

32:22.815 --> 32:27.362
And I, uh... I recall a moment of truth.
Do you remember?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.906
A true test
that you just walked away from.

32:33.952 --> 32:34.786
[scoffs]

32:36.037 --> 32:37.121
[sighs]

32:40.792 --> 32:43.336
-Do you think you know me?
-[Danny] Hey, Colleen...

32:44.045 --> 32:46.881
[chuckles] We've both been crazy busy.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.885
-Colleen's working at a community--
-[scoffs] What the hell is going on?

32:53.471 --> 32:57.433
Come on. This game we're all playing,
hiding our real intentions...

33:01.646 --> 33:04.607
I mean, I don't... I don't 100% know
what you mean. [chuckles]

33:06.359 --> 33:09.570
We invited you two over tonight
to get stuff off our collective chests.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.115
So you know what? Davos has it right.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.033
Let's stop being so damn polite.

33:14.492 --> 33:15.994
Is the truth really that hard?

33:17.787 --> 33:20.456
Or am I the only one with the balls enough
to call it like it is?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.375
Oh, God.

33:23.084 --> 33:26.462
You are both so important to him,

33:27.588 --> 33:30.216
and you are clearly
very angry with him, so...

33:31.634 --> 33:33.970
talk to each other, air the grievances.

33:35.805 --> 33:40.309
I mean, it would be nice to know
what is going on between you two.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.856
Davos, you think
Danny stole the Iron Fist from you.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.482
Danny, you think you won it
fair and square.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.650
So hash it out.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.985
[clears throat]

33:50.945 --> 33:53.656
-You wanna go first?
-This is neither the time nor place.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.867
[scoffs] Then when?

33:57.285 --> 34:00.913
Everything doesn't have to be settled
in a goddamn sun chamber

34:00.997 --> 34:02.749
in K'un-freaking-Lun!

34:03.958 --> 34:04.792
Excuse me.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.381
-[sighs]
-Don't. Let him come back.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.012
[breathes deeply]

34:18.598 --> 34:19.640
So now it's my turn?

34:20.933 --> 34:21.851
Pretty much.

34:22.852 --> 34:24.062
What's your problem with Danny?

34:26.898 --> 34:27.732
[chuckles]

34:28.858 --> 34:32.278
I wouldn't say
that I have a problem with Danny...

34:33.196 --> 34:34.697
as much as...

34:35.573 --> 34:37.408
Well, I have issues
with everything that's happened since he came back into my life. [scoffs]

34:43.247 --> 34:44.957
To find out that my father was alive?

34:46.709 --> 34:49.504
And Danny and my brother, well...

34:50.838 --> 34:51.881
They knew about it,

34:52.715 --> 34:54.050
and they kept it from me.

34:55.968 --> 34:56.844
I mean...

34:58.596 --> 35:00.098
how does someone make that choice?

35:00.556 --> 35:01.724
Joy, there were powers at play

35:01.808 --> 35:03.267
that were bigger than all of us.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.230
We did what we did to protect you.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.275
I can protect myself.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.281
So much of my life was spent living a lie.

35:19.075 --> 35:19.951
And I know...

35:22.036 --> 35:23.246
I know that Harold wasn't...

35:24.914 --> 35:26.332
I know he was a troubled man.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.418
I know that he wasn't right.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.589
But he was my father.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.219
And you kept him from me, Danny.

35:39.428 --> 35:40.429
My dad.

35:42.014 --> 35:42.890
[sighs]

35:45.476 --> 35:46.936
I deserved the truth.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.654
So now, every time I look at him...

35:57.280 --> 35:59.824
[shudders] all of that comes rushing back.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.251
We should go. Now.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.964
No, just... Let's just hold on, okay?

36:16.007 --> 36:17.049
Let's sit back down.

36:17.925 --> 36:18.885
Let's work through this.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.346
I think the wounds
are just a little too fresh.

36:22.930 --> 36:23.764
I know.

36:25.308 --> 36:27.268
That's why me and Ward agreed to do this.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.356
I'm sorry. What?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.108
Ward.

36:34.942 --> 36:35.818
He's coming.

36:37.653 --> 36:38.946
We need to figure this out.

36:45.912 --> 36:46.746
Hey, there.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.206
Need a hand?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.043
Go away, Ward.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.170
I've had my fill of you today.

36:55.546 --> 37:00.593
I just wanted to say
that I might have overreacted earlier.

37:03.846 --> 37:07.141
-See you at the next meeting.
-Can we talk? Just for a minute.

37:08.517 --> 37:10.269
[sighs] You're my sponsor, right?

37:13.522 --> 37:14.899
Are you working for Joy?

37:15.107 --> 37:16.108
[scoffs]

37:16.400 --> 37:18.319
I knew having sex with you was a mistake.

37:18.402 --> 37:19.779
It's an honest question.

37:19.862 --> 37:20.947
Screw you, Ward.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.951
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Please. Please. I'm sorry. Uh...

37:25.326 --> 37:26.661
I am. I really am.

37:26.744 --> 37:27.662
I...

37:28.621 --> 37:32.500
Things have been hard
between Joy and I for a while.

37:32.959 --> 37:38.589
I was waiting for the right time
to tell her that I'm in NA.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.757
Never happened.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.468
So when she already knew,

37:43.135 --> 37:46.472
I felt... robbed.

37:47.348 --> 37:51.435
And... I wanted to know by whom.

37:53.938 --> 37:54.772
Ward... Yes?

38:00.069 --> 38:01.529
You lead with asshole.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.156
[chuckles softly]

38:04.740 --> 38:05.658
And then...

38:09.912 --> 38:11.122
Will you take some advice?

38:12.373 --> 38:13.916
Not as your sponsor and all that, but...

38:15.167 --> 38:17.461
as someone who has two brothers
and a sister of her own.

38:19.588 --> 38:21.048
You're gonna tell me I'm crazy.

38:21.799 --> 38:22.633
No.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.011
Families are crazy.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.431
Relationships are hard.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.018
And life brings challenges, always.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.230
This is a flash point for you,

38:36.314 --> 38:38.316
this thing with Joy.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.777
Whatever the hell is going on between you,

38:43.029 --> 38:44.280
if you don't work it out,

38:45.698 --> 38:50.286
I'm afraid you won't be able to have
a single successful human relationship.

38:52.747 --> 38:53.873
Now go away.

38:55.458 --> 38:56.334
Okay.

38:58.961 --> 39:01.547
So, is this, um...

39:03.299 --> 39:04.133
Are we...

39:06.135 --> 39:07.094
Did I ruin it?

39:11.098 --> 39:13.434
Today's theme is gratitude.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.943
Ward talked you into this.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.489
Into lying to me
after all the goddamn lies?

39:26.572 --> 39:28.532
-He didn't think you'd show.
-I wouldn't have!

39:29.116 --> 39:30.451
I was just trying to help him.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.997
You two are so goddamn twisted.

39:36.248 --> 39:37.375
Of course it was Ward.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.045
Of course.
And he couldn't even show up, huh?

39:41.128 --> 39:42.129
Joy...

39:43.881 --> 39:46.384
he is broken
that you're not talking to him.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.929
You two are family. We all are.

39:51.639 --> 39:55.810
And all I wanted to do was sit down,
break bread and make peace.

39:57.978 --> 39:59.897
[Joy] One big flaw in that logic, Danny...

40:01.899 --> 40:03.275
We're not a family.

40:05.152 --> 40:08.531
You and Ward conspired, behind my back.

40:08.948 --> 40:11.575
Something that seems to come
naturally to the two of you.

40:11.659 --> 40:12.993
Joy, that is enough.

40:14.036 --> 40:14.870
[sighs]

40:41.313 --> 40:42.690
Worthless bastard!

40:43.732 --> 40:47.069
There were photos... surveillance photos
of Danny and Colleen.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.237
The ones you paid for.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.532
How would he have gotten those?

40:51.615 --> 40:52.992
You said she was the best.

41:03.210 --> 41:05.379
[Davos] Call Walker.
Tell her we're coming now.

41:14.805 --> 41:17.349
I know that didn't go
the way you wanted it to...

41:17.975 --> 41:18.809
We tried.

41:19.059 --> 41:21.103
At least we now know
where everyone stands.

41:28.777 --> 41:30.529
I may have thrown gas on the fire.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.828
You were the only one brave enough
to call foul, so...

41:40.331 --> 41:41.415
You're not mad?

41:42.458 --> 41:43.292
No.

41:45.586 --> 41:50.299
If anything, it made me realize
how lucky I am to have you in my corner.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.260
[cell phone vibrating]

41:54.470 --> 41:55.304
[sighs]

41:56.472 --> 41:57.348
Always.

42:02.019 --> 42:02.853
Hello?

42:03.437 --> 42:04.313
Sorry, who is this?

42:05.481 --> 42:07.733
Uh, yeah, give us ten minutes.
We'll be right there.

42:09.568 --> 42:10.402
It's Mrs. Yang.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.196
Something's up with the parley.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.288
Thank you for coming.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.123
Is your husband
meeting the Tigers tonight?

42:23.207 --> 42:24.875
The meeting is to begin in a few moments.

42:24.959 --> 42:28.671
I'm taking his place at the table,
and I'd like you two to accompany me.

42:29.213 --> 42:30.089
Did he back out?

42:30.172 --> 42:32.633
No. He had to return to Hong Kong.
A family emergency.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.802
I tried to put off the meeting
until his return,

42:34.885 --> 42:37.888
but the danger of continued confrontation
is too high.

42:39.014 --> 42:39.932
Yeah.

42:40.516 --> 42:43.185
I need to make a show of strength
as I begin the negotiation.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.230
I know who you are, what you can do.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.482
I believe the Tigers do as well.

42:50.609 --> 42:51.485
Okay.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.404
We're in. Weapons.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.139
He is the weapon.

44:33.879 --> 44:35.798
Thank you for agreeing to meet.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.467
I agreed to meet with your husband.

44:39.968 --> 44:42.137
And he sends his regrets and apologies.

44:48.310 --> 44:49.687
The dragon head baton.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.731
Symbol of absolute authority in our Triad.

44:53.315 --> 44:55.067
My husband has entrusted me with it.

44:55.401 --> 44:57.361
I speak on behalf of the Hatchet Triad.

44:59.113 --> 45:01.699
I accept your authority
in this negotiation...

45:04.034 --> 45:04.993
Mrs. Yang.

45:09.832 --> 45:10.874
Shall we begin?

45:13.711 --> 45:15.796
We'll hand over control
of the Red Hook docks

45:15.879 --> 45:18.549
in exchange for your real estate holdings
in New Jersey.

45:18.799 --> 45:21.969
An annual payout over ten years
at 45 percent.

45:22.052 --> 45:22.970
Fifteen percent.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.096
Thirty-five.

45:24.763 --> 45:27.474
The docks were ours
for over three decades.

45:28.726 --> 45:29.893
Twenty percent.

45:29.977 --> 45:31.311
[Sherry] And then they weren't.

45:32.187 --> 45:33.021
Thirty-five percent.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.357
[Ho] It's a matter of honor.

45:36.150 --> 45:38.444
[Sherry scoffs] No, it's pride.

45:39.778 --> 45:41.321
These are fair terms.

45:42.114 --> 45:43.824
Take them or bring on the war.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.958
We need some time
to make arrangements in New Jersey.

45:53.876 --> 45:54.835
We need to leave.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.044
Something's not right.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.504
We're close to an agreement.

45:58.172 --> 45:59.173
[Danny] What are you planning?

46:01.175 --> 46:02.009
Is this a trap?

46:02.092 --> 46:04.303
You have no place at this table.

46:07.514 --> 46:09.141
You brought me here to keep you safe.

46:10.058 --> 46:10.934
You're not safe.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.312
There's someone outside.

46:14.396 --> 46:15.230
We need to go.

46:16.064 --> 46:16.899
Now.

46:18.692 --> 46:19.818
Don't.

46:28.619 --> 46:29.620
[all grunting] End him!

47:06.365 --> 47:07.241
[coughing]

47:09.034 --> 47:10.035
Keep moving.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.171
[groaning]

47:25.467 --> 47:27.135
[yelling]

47:33.976 --> 47:35.018
[Danny] Who is out there?

47:36.228 --> 47:37.062
Tell me.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.734
Who's outside, huh?

47:45.904 --> 47:46.905
[panting]

47:47.739 --> 47:49.449
[police siren wailing in distance]

48:04.006 --> 48:05.757
[white noise]

48:10.178 --> 48:11.930
[muffled sound of door opening]

48:13.932 --> 48:15.893
[Joy speaking inaudibly]

48:17.311 --> 48:19.521
-He had the photos that I paid you for.
-[white noise fades]

48:20.939 --> 48:22.816
Say that again. I missed the first part.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.526
[Davos] We've come from Danny Rand's home.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.612
Your surveillance photos, he has them.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.947
[Joy] So that means
that your cover has been blown.

48:29.031 --> 48:30.073
[exhales]

48:30.157 --> 48:31.074
[Joy] How about ours?

48:32.951 --> 48:33.827
I'll deal with it.

48:34.286 --> 48:35.996
It will not affect our prior arrangement.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.332
-[Davos] We'll need more than that.
-That's complicated.

48:39.416 --> 48:41.126
The situation is salvageable.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.130
-I would like you to leave now.
-[Joy scoffs]

48:46.298 --> 48:49.051
[Joy] And we would like some answers now.

48:49.551 --> 48:51.178
[clears throat and sighs]

48:51.261 --> 48:52.095
Uh...

48:52.971 --> 48:54.598
I told you I'll handle it.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.808
[Davos] You will tell us the details,

48:57.809 --> 48:58.852
or I will make you.

49:00.771 --> 49:01.980
[Joy] Jesus.

49:02.981 --> 49:04.691
It doesn't have to go down like this.

49:06.109 --> 49:08.195
Like you said, we had a prior arrangement.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.407
Your partner threatened me.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.035
I don't like threats.

49:15.869 --> 49:19.873
Walker, tell me how Danny Rand
got those photos.

49:21.833 --> 49:23.168
-[thud]
-[gasps[]

49:26.213 --> 49:27.839
I'm not leaving here until you do.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.970
Whatever blows your skirt up. [dramatic music playing]
