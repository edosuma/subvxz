Jessica won't lay out

00:13.000 --> 00:14.499
this pathetic excuse
of a candidates list?

00:14.500 --> 00:16.869
I call it inevitable,
because our students can read.

00:16.870 --> 00:19.030

00:25.420 --> 00:27.749

back up to Harvard,

00:31.150 --> 00:32.509

And the fact is,
you're not a goddamn lawyer.

She said the fact is, is that
I'm not a goddamn lawyer.

00:44.400 --> 00:45.739
Well, the only way
to change that fact

00:45.740 --> 00:47.569
is for a jury to see me be
a goddamn lawyer.

00:47.570 --> 00:49.069
You try that,
all they're gonna see

00:49.070 --> 00:50.330

Did Mike Ross approach you

Anita Gibbs dragged me in

02:05.480 --> 02:06.979
and told me she was gonna
put me away for ten years.

02:06.980 --> 02:08.440
I don't give a shit
what she told you.

02:08.449 --> 02:09.680
You said you were gonna
call a lawyer.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.219
Yeah, well, before
I had a chance to do that,

02:11.220 --> 02:12.710
they showed me
what they had,

02:12.720 --> 02:15.380

witnesses, and everything else

02:15.390 --> 02:17.050

to do this?

02:19.830 --> 02:22.329

prison for you.

Gibbs can get you
out of this.

02:29.870 --> 02:32.500
She offered you a deal that can
make this whole thing stop.

02:32.510 --> 02:34.650

not to testify against you,

02:34.651 --> 02:36.770
why don't you think about
testifying against Harvey?

never do that to a friend!

05:52.080 --> 05:53.750

Fraud, who not only
didn't pass the bar or go

even graduate college.

25 other students
are also not in this yearbook.

07:12.220 --> 07:13.880
Are those other students
being charged with fraud?

07:13.890 --> 07:16.729
Of course not, because
we don't put people on trial

07:16.730 --> 07:19.629
for being sick on picture day,
and no matter--

07:19.630 --> 07:23.969
What he says, the fact is,
Mike Ross is not a lawyer.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.399
He's a fraud.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.730
And we will prove that
beyond a shadow of a doubt.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.739
The defense would like
to call its first witness.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.809
Right there--
he's such a non-lawyer,

07:32.810 --> 07:34.750
he doesn't even know
the prosecution goes first.

07:34.751 --> 07:35.900
And you obviously don't know

07:35.910 --> 07:38.670
Jarvis v. the State of New York,
1937,

07:38.680 --> 07:40.040
when calling
of the first witness

07:40.050 --> 07:41.849
is of such special nature
as to disrupt

07:41.850 --> 07:44.680

07:48.260 --> 07:49.689
as its first witness.

07:49.690 --> 07:51.850
Harvey, unless you have
something to overturn this,

07:51.860 --> 07:53.450
I'm gonna need you
to have a seat.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.469
Mr. Specter, you said
there's no record of me

07:58.470 --> 08:00.499
ever having an apartment
in Boston.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.400
Can you explain to the jury
why there's no record

08:02.410 --> 08:03.639
of you ever having
lived there?

08:03.640 --> 08:05.280
I'm not the one
on trial here.

08:05.281 --> 08:06.370
No, you're not.

08:06.380 --> 08:07.479
You're the one in that chair,

08:07.480 --> 08:08.679
so why don't you answer
the question,

08:08.680 --> 08:10.279
or we can stop this whole thing
right now.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.015
There's no record
of me living there

08:12.016 --> 08:15.010
because I sublet up there
when I had my place down here.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.089
So it is possible

08:16.090 --> 08:17.919
that a person not have
a Boston address

08:17.920 --> 08:20.689
without it meaning that
they didn't attend Harvard.

08:20.690 --> 08:23.159
Great.
Thank you so much.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.989
This witness is excused.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.490
And what, exactly,
is your reason

08:26.500 --> 08:28.165
for not having
an address up there?

08:28.166 --> 08:30.990
Unless you're too afraid
to answer my questions.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.839
No, I'm not afraid
of you at all.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.669
My reason is that I chose
to live with my friend

08:34.669 --> 08:36.308
Trevor during that time.

08:36.309 --> 08:37.875
The only problem
with that is,

08:37.876 --> 08:40.539
your friend Trevor has lived
in Brooklyn his entire life.

08:40.539 --> 08:42.840
Exactly a 3 hour and 20 minute
drive from Harvard.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.915
So you're saying
you made that drive every day?

08:44.916 --> 08:46.240
No,
I only went up for tests

08:46.250 --> 08:47.719
because that's
all I had to do.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.389
I guess you needed
some extra tutoring, huh?

08:50.390 --> 08:52.789
You expect these people
to believe that you graduated

08:52.790 --> 08:54.730
from the most competitive
law school in the world

08:54.731 --> 08:56.180
without ever going to class?

08:56.190 --> 08:57.850
See, that's funny,
because you actually

08:57.860 --> 08:59.099
expect these people
to believe

08:59.100 --> 09:00.529
that I never went
to law school at all

09:00.530 --> 09:02.199
and yet still somehow
managed to convince

09:02.200 --> 09:04.035
the smartest lawyers
in the world

09:04.036 --> 09:06.590
to make me their
youngest partner ever.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.730
Whose story is looking
more far-fetched now?

09:11.670 --> 09:14.000
Oh, no answer?

Are you two
discussing something

09:24.120 --> 09:25.419
that defense should
be made aware of?

09:25.420 --> 09:28.850
Just talking about
the Knicks.

09:28.860 --> 09:32.095
Now is the prosecution ready
to call their first witness?

09:32.096 --> 09:34.759
The prosecution's first
witness is this affidavit

09:34.760 --> 09:36.920
from every single member
of the defendant's

09:36.930 --> 09:38.490

to reveal it to our families

23:52.120 --> 23:53.510
after we were married again.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.619
And how, exactly,
did it go

23:54.620 --> 23:56.050
when you got married
the first time?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.329
We were in Las Vegas--

23:57.330 --> 23:58.789
Yeah, yeah, I don't
give a shit where you were.

23:58.790 --> 24:00.790

What color was the cake?

24:00.800 --> 24:02.299
- Objection.
- Who was there?

24:02.300 --> 24:03.969
Were there any witnesses?
Your Honor, he's badgering--

24:03.970 --> 24:05.769
Who were the witnesses?
And what goddamn time was it?

24:05.770 --> 24:07.169

- Tell me right now.

24:08.211 --> 24:11.030

24:11.040 --> 24:13.209
The dress was white.

24:13.210 --> 24:16.209
And the cake was vanilla
with a buttercream frosting.

24:16.210 --> 24:20.070
It was a small ceremony
at around 10:00 p.m.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.910
And I remember
the man who married us

24:21.920 --> 24:23.619
like it was yesterday

24:23.620 --> 24:27.459
because it was the most
special day of my life.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.789
And when you came up
with this story,

24:28.790 --> 24:30.450
did Mr. Ross at least
give you the courtesy of

24:30.460 --> 24:31.959
letting you make up
your own memories

24:31.960 --> 24:33.199

sacred day?

24:33.200 --> 24:34.299

24:34.300 --> 24:36.169

himself at trial,

24:36.170 --> 24:39.099

24:40.140 --> 24:41.639
And I've got
one more question:

24:41.640 --> 24:45.239
did you vow to remain
faithful to Mr. Ross

24:45.240 --> 24:46.539
throughout your marriage?

24:46.540 --> 24:47.600
Yes, I did.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.809
Yeah, then I guess
when you cheated on him

24:49.810 --> 24:52.470
with Logan Sanders,
it means you lied to him

24:52.480 --> 24:54.140
at that non-existent ceremony,

24:54.150 --> 24:56.419
just like you're lying
to all of us right now.

24:56.420 --> 24:58.889
That's enough.

24:58.890 --> 25:00.959
If you want to bring more
outside information

25:00.960 --> 25:05.689
to dispute this marriage,
feel free, but for right now...

25:05.690 --> 25:07.190

25:18.510 --> 25:20.179

25:21.280 --> 25:22.539
I did take care of Gibbs.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.570
Well, then why the hell
did someone from her office

25:24.580 --> 25:26.549
contact Sheila in Argentina?

25:26.550 --> 25:28.549
Louis, they're just
trying to scare you.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.319
And even if she tells them
everything,

25:30.320 --> 25:32.355

with Sheila.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.450

we did with Mike?

25:34.460 --> 25:37.059
The only proof they'll ever
have that we knew about Mike

25:37.060 --> 25:38.989
is if we tell them.

25:38.990 --> 25:41.620

I'm going to take the Fifth,

25:41.630 --> 25:43.469

the same thing.

25:43.470 --> 25:44.599

Mike went to Harvard.

25:52.270 --> 25:54.100
It was your decision
to hire him,

25:54.110 --> 25:55.479
and you stand by it 100%.

25:55.480 --> 25:56.979

25:56.980 --> 25:59.149
What's going on is that
Jessica's happy asking me

to witness tamper,

26:00.850 --> 26:02.190

she won't--

26:02.191 --> 26:03.980
Witness tamper?
What did you have him do?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.649
She had me move Sheila
out of the country.

26:05.650 --> 26:06.650
Are you crazy?

26:06.660 --> 26:07.919
Look, I did
what I had to do.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.750
Then why won't you do
what you have to do for me?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.229

it would open me up to perjury.
