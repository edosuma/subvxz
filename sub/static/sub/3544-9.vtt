00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.040 --> 00:05.405
- Silas.
- Hello, my shadow self.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.523
Every time I close my eyes...

00:07.720 --> 00:09.768
I can feel myself drowning
in that safe...

00:09.960 --> 00:11.564
and I need to make it stop.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.364
My body is breaking down.

00:13.560 --> 00:16.723
There is one enemy
that I can never escape: time. Goodbye.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.408
- What are you doing?
- I'm dying of old age.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.728
- Stefan...
- Hey, you're Katherine Pierce.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.082
Suck it up.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.561
The good news about having
vampire blood in your system...

00:26.720 --> 00:28.848
is that's step one to creating
a new vampire.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.246
This is step two.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.247
He's gonna tear my head off.
Elena, please.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.848
No! Jesse, just stay with me.

00:38.400 --> 00:40.129
Caroline, I'm so sorry.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.084
Why does it say "12144"?

00:42.280 --> 00:44.726
- What do you care?
- Because I was 21051.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.922
You were an Augustine vampire?

00:48.400 --> 00:51.643
I'm sure Augustine will be thrilled
to have you back.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.566
<i>And that's the state of the
world from your hometown TV news station...</i>

00:59.760 --> 01:01.762
<i>on June 11th, 1953.</i>

01:01.960 --> 01:04.122
<i>Good night, Mystic Falls.</i>

01:06.000 --> 01:07.490
Hey.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.447
I'm looking for Joseph Salvatore.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.324
You found him.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.764
Love what you've done
with the place.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.566
If this whole boarding-house thing
doesn't pan out...

01:17.800 --> 01:20.007
you can turn it into
a high-class brothel.

01:20.200 --> 01:21.770
I'm glad you got my telegram.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.088
I haven't heard from Stefan,
but I hope he'll be here soon.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.487
- When was the last time you two spoke?
- Well...

01:26.680 --> 01:28.569
he doesn't call, he doesn't write.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.250
Of course, neither do I.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.006
In all fairness, I am the one
that abandoned him...

01:33.200 --> 01:36.010
on a train platform
in the middle of World War ll.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.965
Well, there's always
time to be a better man.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.204
Yeah, not sure I got one of those in me.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.049
Sorry about the vervain, Damon.
Money was too good to pass up.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.203
Well, now I won't have to pay him.

02:00.680 --> 02:02.728
Who the hell are you?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.525
I'll be your doctor from now on.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.360
What are you doing to me?

02:13.560 --> 02:15.881
Just a little vervain.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.641
What the hell are you doing to me?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.241
Vervain. To keep you calm.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.728
Wes? Why am I here?

02:35.040 --> 02:37.441
I lost a test subject last night.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.363
And you're gonna replace him.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.888
Dear Diary, so here <i>I</i> am, alive.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.208
<i>Stefan saved me from killing myself.</i>

02:54.440 --> 02:56.886
<i>Now he's got me on suicide watch.</i>

02:57.080 --> 03:00.209
<i>He says it will be therapeutic
for me to write down my feelings...</i>

03:00.400 --> 03:04.007
<i>about the fact that I'm dying
and there's nothing I can do about it.</i>

03:04.240 --> 03:07.961
<i>Deep thoughts, mortal coil,
blah, blah, blah.</i>

03:08.200 --> 03:09.247
<i>My hand's tired.</i>

03:12.120 --> 03:15.203
What kind of sentimental idiot
writes down everything they feel?

03:15.400 --> 03:18.563
Is this what the prophecy meant
when it said all the doppelgangers...

03:18.800 --> 03:20.564
were drawn together like magnets?

03:20.800 --> 03:23.280
Because if it is, I want my money back.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.887
I'm trying to make sure
you don't slit your wrists.

03:26.080 --> 03:27.923
Well, this whole neurotic granny vibe...

03:28.120 --> 03:30.122
doesn't exactly make me want to live.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.642
Do you really have nothing
better to do...

03:32.880 --> 03:35.565
than stand there all day
and watch me write in cursive?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.240
- I'm trying to make sure you don't kill yourself.
- How?

03:38.480 --> 03:40.801
Since you're still having
your little panic attacks.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.329
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, of course.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.131
You are the picture of
mental health, Stefan.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.129
After being locked in a safe...

03:48.320 --> 03:51.130
- ...at the bottom of a quarry.
- I am dealing with it.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.961
I know. I mean, I heard you
"dealing with it" earlier today.

03:55.160 --> 03:58.881
In the library. It sounded like
you freaked out and broke a chair.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.127
Maybe even two.

04:00.320 --> 04:02.641
How are you supposed
to help me stay alive...

04:02.920 --> 04:04.524
if you can't even help yourself?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.967
So does this mean you want to live?

04:07.160 --> 04:10.767
No, it means that I can't work with people
who can't give me 100 percent.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.327
And so I may have called for backup.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.487
- What are you doing here?
- I'm your sober sponsor...

04:21.680 --> 04:24.570
- ...and I heard that you needed help.
- Really?

04:25.040 --> 04:29.090
And I got my morn to drop off
something for us to use.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.491
Don't worry, I sanitized it.

04:39.760 --> 04:42.366
- Aaron, hey.
- Hey.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.847
- So you heard?
- Heard what?

04:45.040 --> 04:46.451
That Jesse's dead.

04:47.880 --> 04:49.325
He killed himself last night.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.807
Uh, campus security came by to tell me.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.729
Oh, my God.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.486
I'm so sorry.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.490
Yeah.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.811
What's up with this college?
It's supposed to be different.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.209
I came here to start fresh,
get away from all the crap in my past.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.129
I get it.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.081
After everything you've been through,
everything that you've lost...

05:18.880 --> 05:20.689
I would've wanted to start over too.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.922
- How do you hit the reset button?
- Me?

05:23.120 --> 05:25.521
Uh, heh, I haven't reset anything.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.240
All my problems, they've followed me here.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.930
Come to think of it, I'm probably not the
right person to be getting advice from.

05:33.120 --> 05:36.681
So if you're not here about Jesse, uh,
why are you here?

05:37.920 --> 05:40.651
I don't wanna bother you,
especially right now.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.447
My day's not gonna get any worse,
so, uh, go ahead.

05:45.440 --> 05:49.729
Okay, well, um, last night you told me
that Wes was your legal guardian.

05:49.920 --> 05:53.288
Yeah, since, uh, this past summer.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.204
After my Aunt Sara died.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.362
You see what I'm talking about?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.685
Everyone around me ends up dead.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.285
My sunny disposition
makes me so many friends.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.169
I'm sorry.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.164
Go ahead.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.610
The thing is, my boyfriend Damon
went to talk to Wes last night...

06:19.800 --> 06:22.804
and no one's really seen or heard
from either of them since...

06:23.040 --> 06:24.883
and it kind of worries me, you know?

06:25.080 --> 06:27.811
I know how bad the timing is, but I just...

06:28.040 --> 06:29.963
I was hoping you could help me find Wes.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.480
Yeah.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.202
Yeah. Uh, I think I know a place
that we can look.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.289
Just so you know...

06:38.480 --> 06:41.006
it didn't end well for
the last Augustines.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.289
You're inviting bad karma in
by holding me here.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.801
Is that what you told Dr. Whitmore?

06:47.760 --> 06:52.004
<i>DAMON'. Huh. Dr. Whitmore
wasn't much for conversation.</i>

06:58.000 --> 07:00.844
As much as I would like a free checkup...

07:01.840 --> 07:03.330
you're gonna let me go.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.731
That's a good try. I'm wearing vervain.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.522
You know, most people
would buy me dinner first.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.327
This isn't a personal matter,
it's for the advancement of science.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.649
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You're a vampire.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.366
Your blood heals others,
your body heals itself.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.847
You'll regenerate parts of internal organs
after I remove them.

07:27.040 --> 07:30.044
How I got this amazing body
has nothing to do with science.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.009
So running... Aah!

07:35.040 --> 07:36.371
You talk too much.

07:45.560 --> 07:48.484
I see you Augustine freaks are still at it.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.528
Eye exams and that sort of thing.

07:52.720 --> 07:55.564
Jesse was proof that my research
goes far beyond that.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.565
I trained him to crave vampire blood
instead of human blood.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.644
Now I'm ready to take my research
to the next level.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.763
It doesn't make sense
why Jesse would kill himself.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.927
So you believe
what campus security told you?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.402
Why, do you know something else?

08:17.360 --> 08:20.728
Don't you think it's weird that both
of your friends committed suicide...

08:20.920 --> 08:23.082
before the first semester was even over?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.089
Yeah, of course I think it's weird.

08:25.320 --> 08:29.006
I mean, Jesse loved it here.
He had a huge crush on your friend.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.601
And Megan had all these plans
for her life.

08:31.840 --> 08:34.047
Which is why none of this makes sense.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.126
Aaron, look, I found Megan's body
the night that she died.

08:38.320 --> 08:39.446
She was murdered.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.726
And Wes forged her death certificate.

08:42.919 --> 08:45.366
- You saw her death certificate?
- I did some digging.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.451
Wes is part of something
much bigger than anyone even realizes.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.844
Let's find him first.
I wanna hear his side of the story.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.008
Oh. Um...

09:06.640 --> 09:09.484
You know, when you said that
Wes was probably doing research...

09:09.720 --> 09:11.484
I didn't realize it would be here.

09:12.640 --> 09:15.883
- At Whitmore House.
- Oh, yeah, this place is like his second home.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.246
- Hmm.
- What are you waiting for? Come in.

09:26.160 --> 09:28.288
So who owns this place?

09:28.480 --> 09:32.644
Not to sound like a douche,
but technically, I do.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.488
Yeah, it's part of the Whitmore trust
I inherited when my parents died.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.283
Yeah, don't hold that against me.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.086
Usually, when people find out
my name's Aaron Whitmore...

09:43.280 --> 09:46.090
Hold on, your last name's Whitmore?

09:48.280 --> 09:50.965
So you, like, own this school?

09:51.160 --> 09:52.685
That's what they think.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.007
That's my dad.

10:04.880 --> 10:08.771
Grayson Gilbert was one of the best doctors
the Augustines ever had.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.920
What the hell?

10:16.880 --> 10:18.962
I'm glad he didn't live to see this.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.681
I spent three months drowning in this thing.
What the hell were you thinking?

10:26.880 --> 10:28.530
I was thinking...

10:28.720 --> 10:31.326
it's time for you to deal
with the source of your PTSD.

10:31.560 --> 10:35.007
You're not just sublimating your feelings
about what happened to Jesse?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.851
Feelings? What feelings would I have
about my best friend...

10:38.040 --> 10:39.530
killing the guy I was crushing on?

10:39.720 --> 10:42.371
He was out of control,
and Elena did what she had to do.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.370
No, Elena did what she thought
she had to do.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.609
Just like she also thought
that Damon was good boyfriend material.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.484
You see where I'm going with this?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.442
Anyway, aren't you a drama major?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.449
What do you know about PTSD?

10:57.160 --> 11:00.607
Well, I know that you tried
to deal with it your own way...

11:00.840 --> 11:02.285
and you failed.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.363
So now...

11:07.040 --> 11:09.042
we're gonna try it my way.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.723
You know that this is kidnapping, right?

11:19.240 --> 11:22.449
- That was more like a tranquilizer.
- Oh.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.211
Okay. Uh, what is going on here, Wes?

11:25.400 --> 11:28.404
I had to make sure Megan's death
didn't draw attention to my work.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.290
Oh, to your work? Your work?

11:30.480 --> 11:32.608
You study infectious disease transmittal.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.040
I study vampires.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.051
- What?
- They exist, Aaron.

11:37.240 --> 11:39.527
And Elena Gilbert is one of them.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.928
That syringe I used on
her had vervain in it.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.844
Think of it as an anti-vampire drug.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.042
It's one of my safety measures.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.044
Where did all this stuff come from?

11:57.240 --> 12:01.040
This work has been going on
for generations, in secret.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.369
Your family pioneered it.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.761
Your dad trained me in it.

12:08.000 --> 12:12.050
And after your father died, the Whitmore
trust continued to fund my research.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.370
- Why didn't you ever tell me about this?
- You never needed to know before now.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.165
I meant to tell you this on your birthday.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.401
This is what your family fought for...

12:26.680 --> 12:29.968
and believed in, Aaron.
Consider it your legacy.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.206
Come on, Elena, wake up.

12:42.680 --> 12:43.727
<i>Hey-</i>

12:43.920 --> 12:46.400
- Hi.
- Damon? Are you...?

12:46.600 --> 12:47.681
I'm fine.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.085
Wes injected you with vervain.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.762
Maybe when it wears off,
we'll be able to break through these.

12:54.400 --> 12:58.928
What the hell is going on?
Why are you here? Why am I here?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.726
Wes is carrying out
the grand Augustine tradition:

13:01.960 --> 13:03.962
Getting his kicks off vampire torture.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.847
Did he tell you that?

13:06.080 --> 13:07.286
He didn't have to.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.291
I've been here before.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.242
<i>Someone in my family sold me out
to the Augustines in 1953.</i>

13:17.560 --> 13:20.166
<i>Every day, this nut job, Dr. Whitmore,
tortured us...</i>

13:20.400 --> 13:22.926
<i>cut into us, took
pieces of our eyes out...</i>

13:23.160 --> 13:25.367
<i>pushed us to every
limit he could imagine.</i>

13:25.560 --> 13:27.881
<i>And he had quite the imagination.</i>

13:29.520 --> 13:30.885
He kept me in this very cell.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.606
Don't think I haven't
appreciated the irony.

13:34.360 --> 13:37.170
- How long were you here?
- Five years, give or take.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.805
Damon, how did you not go crazy?

13:39.040 --> 13:42.203
Believe it or not, I made a friend.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.330
Welcome.

13:59.200 --> 14:02.841
Dr. Whitmore never gets tired
of watching us vampires heal.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.088
But he gives us
one glass of blood per day...

14:05.360 --> 14:07.522
just enough to keep us alive.

14:07.720 --> 14:09.051
Pick yourself up, soldier.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.882
My name's Enzo.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.051
He was a soldier in Europe
during World War ll.

14:20.240 --> 14:21.480
How did he end up here?

14:21.680 --> 14:23.760
Dr. Whitmore was working
in a battlefield hospital...

14:23.960 --> 14:25.689
when he discovered Enzo was a vampire.

14:25.920 --> 14:30.084
So he drugged him, locked him in a coffin
to ship him overseas.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.250
<i>He'd been here for 10 years
by the time I joined the party.</i>

14:35.080 --> 14:36.730
You're doing it wrong.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.443
You're living for the moment.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.211
- You need to live for the future.
- What future?

14:46.440 --> 14:48.044
The one where you get your revenge.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.725
For instance, in my future...

14:49.920 --> 14:53.720
my revenge will start with killing Whitmore's
dog and mailing it to his house...

14:53.920 --> 14:54.967
postage due.

14:55.600 --> 14:59.400
Go on. Picture your revenge.
Use your imagination.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.610
Yeah.

15:14.800 --> 15:15.926
I can see it.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.327
Damon...

15:25.400 --> 15:27.243
Wes knew my dad.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.130
They worked together.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.448
He said that my dad was an Augustine too.

15:38.800 --> 15:42.122
I know that my dad was a vampire hunter...

15:42.320 --> 15:45.005
but he was also the town doctor.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.205
He was kind and gentle and loving.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.331
He wouldn't be part of a place
that would cut your eyes out.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.686
People are full of surprises.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.965
<i>Hey-</i>

16:02.160 --> 16:05.289
I am so, so sorry I got you
caught up in this.

16:05.720 --> 16:08.007
Hey. Hey.

16:10.160 --> 16:11.525
Look at me.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.845
<i>Hey-</i>

16:16.200 --> 16:18.806
But I promise you...

16:19.000 --> 16:21.002
I will get you out of here.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.850
Okay?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.689
I'll get you out of here.

16:39.800 --> 16:40.847
Caroline?

16:41.560 --> 16:44.882
- Do you even know what you're doing?
- Yes. Well, it's in my textbook.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.411
Let me find it.

16:49.200 --> 16:52.329
Have you two ever, um...? Ahem. You know.

16:52.560 --> 16:53.607
No, I don't know.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.131
Oh, come on, you know.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.926
- Have you?
- Oh, my God. Katherine...

16:59.160 --> 17:00.764
Seriously? Ugh.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.850
That wasn't exactly a yes or a no.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.406
- We are friends.
- Your loss. He's great in bed.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.887
Oh, God. I'm so not listening to this.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.251
Here. Okay, Stefan.
Prolonged exposure therapy.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.888
"In vivo exposure gradually introduces
elements of prior trauma...

17:18.079 --> 17:21.323
e. g. physical objects,
circumstances of duress..."

17:21.599 --> 17:23.125
Okay, yeah, yeah. Got it, got it.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.084
Stop talking. You're giving me a headache.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.927
Caroline? Caroline?

17:29.120 --> 17:31.240
I'm just trying to
help Stefan understand...

17:31.400 --> 17:34.643
This book isn't helping.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.887
I can't breathe.

17:42.480 --> 17:46.724
You are right about one thing, he needs
to get over the root of his problem...

17:46.960 --> 17:50.487
because right now, the score is safe 1,
Stefan O.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.168
So how do you help the guy
who always comes to the rescue?

17:55.360 --> 17:58.489
Stefan's a hero.
It's who he is at his core.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.361
He can't always come through for himself,
but he can for everyone else.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.367
I've got an idea.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.447
Damon, how did you survive
all those years?

18:21.640 --> 18:23.802
<i>We return to the season's most exciting...</i>

18:24.000 --> 18:25.561
<i>DAMON'.
Enzo's friendship kept me alive.</i>

18:25.720 --> 18:27.643
<i>He gave me a reason
to hang onto my humanity...</i>

18:27.840 --> 18:29.365
You much of a sports fan, Damon?

18:29.560 --> 18:32.131
<i>DAMON"...even when I thought
I'd be a prisoner forever.</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:34.322
No, neither am I.

18:35.160 --> 18:40.041
Any other interests?
Fine wines, travel, cars?

18:43.080 --> 18:45.811
I'm partial to Jaguars, myself.

18:46.320 --> 18:51.884
Convertibles. The kind you take
on a Sunday drive to impress a pretty girl.

18:52.760 --> 18:53.921
Ever done that?

18:56.520 --> 19:00.411
- Once or twice.
- Oh, come now, gotta be more than that.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.881
Well, the girl I was trying to impress
was more of a horse-and-carriage type girl.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.202
What, just one girl?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.967
Never met another one like her.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.005
Well, fair enough.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.809
What about you?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.364
Any Pretty girls?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.369
Ah, too many to count.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.087
Actually, there was one.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.970
Her name was Maggie.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.361
Where'd you meet her?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.046
Heh. Here, of all places.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.004
She was working for Dr. Whitmore.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.447
Charming.

19:39.040 --> 19:42.089
Oh, she was. Very.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.122
She was kind to me.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.527
She used to sit here in the hallway,
taking notes while she observed me.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.604
That's how you fell for her?

19:52.800 --> 19:55.246
Well, she was also stunningly beautiful.

19:55.480 --> 19:56.766
Ah.

19:57.000 --> 20:01.608
You have to understand, she wasn't part of
the torture and the experiments.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.367
For the longest while, she didn't realize
that Dr. Whitmore was doing more...

20:05.560 --> 20:07.927
than just observing my behavior.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.881
I didn't have the heart to tell her.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.048
I was just so glad of her company,
you know?

20:14.480 --> 20:15.766
Yeah.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.009
When she finally realized
what was going on here...

20:19.240 --> 20:21.049
she couldn't bear it.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.366
So she said she was sorry...

20:24.840 --> 20:26.171
and she left.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.365
Well, you know, unh...

20:32.000 --> 20:34.367
never really would have worked, anyway.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.004
You're a vampire, she's a human.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.481
Relationship would have been doomed
from the beginning.

20:41.680 --> 20:44.524
You need a more positive outlook, mate.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.404
Who's next?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.847
- 21051, you seem to have more energy.
- I take that as an insult.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.128
I'm far more energetic
than my neighbor, here.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.162
- Can't believe you didn't notice.
<i>- I'll</i> return, then.

22:08.200 --> 22:10.362
Why are you doing this to us?

22:14.360 --> 22:16.283
Because, 21051

22:16.520 --> 22:20.286
I'm seeking out the smallest indivisible
unit of your biological makeup.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.200
And once I can understand you
from a cellular level...

22:23.440 --> 22:25.169
I can put you to use.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.042
Oh, my God, Damon.
Okay, Stefan is gonna figure this out.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.846
When you don't come home,
and no one hears from me...

22:44.040 --> 22:46.361
he Will... He Will find us.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.801
Points for optimism.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.084
But unfortunately, Stefan doesn't even know
this place exists.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.325
But you were here for five years.

22:54.520 --> 22:57.569
Yeah, and the first year
I thought he'd rescue me. He didn't.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.926
Once I escaped, there was no point
in giving him more to feel guilty about.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.762
So I never told him what happened here.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.602
I never told anyone.

23:13.920 --> 23:17.129
Yeah, but you did escape.
How did you do it?

23:19.520 --> 23:22.524
They let us out of the
basement once a year.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.327
<i>Every New Year's Eve...</i>

23:27.520 --> 23:31.809
<i>the Augustine people had a little cocktail
party with a vampire buffet on the side.</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:34.168
<i>We were weak from vervain injections.</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:37.447
<i>Half starved
from living on a glass of blood a day.</i>

23:38.040 --> 23:39.610
<i>Chained up like animals.</i>

23:39.800 --> 23:43.441
<i>This shindig is where Dr. Whitmore
got to show all of his Augustine friends...</i>

23:43.640 --> 23:45.927
<i>what he'd found in his research.</i>

23:46.120 --> 23:50.011
Mrs. Fell has generously offered her hand
for the purpose of this demonstration.

23:50.240 --> 23:51.321
Please observe.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.847
<i>DAMON'.
He let his guests drink from us...</i>

23:54.040 --> 23:56.361
<i>to demonstrate the healing power
of vampire blood.</i>

23:56.560 --> 24:01.122
Dermal layer is completely healed.
No nerve damage, no muscular damage.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.842
- See for yourselves.
- Ha, ha.

24:09.520 --> 24:13.127
But on the plus side,
that's how Enzo came up with his plan.

24:13.800 --> 24:16.804
Well, the thing about
our daily ration of blood...

24:17.160 --> 24:20.289
is there's barely enough
for one vampire to survive on.

24:20.560 --> 24:25.566
But if one vampire were to drink two
rations every day for the next year...

24:25.760 --> 24:27.683
he'd be able to build up his strength.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.929
So that by the time
New Year's Eve comes around again...

24:31.120 --> 24:34.090
that one vampire will be ready to fight.

24:35.720 --> 24:40.089
- You sure that would work?
- I'm sure I can only try it with your help.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.809
We've just got to choose between us.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.647
All right, Damon.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.931
We're gonna play scissor-paper-stone
to decide.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.011
Paper covers rock.

25:11.400 --> 25:14.165
All right, then, a win's a win,
you'll lead the way.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.324
Here's my ration.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.490
Now, we've got 364 days
to get you ready for the party.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.125
Cheers.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.045
Cheers.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.211
So did it work?

25:33.600 --> 25:34.681
More or less.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.121
How did you get out?

25:37.840 --> 25:39.171
Doesn't matter, Elena.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.963
I got strong, I got out.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.209
Wasn't pretty, all you need to know.

25:56.120 --> 25:59.647
Here, another birthday present.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.723
This belonged to your great-grandfather.

26:06.960 --> 26:09.691
It's a safety precaution
for use in vampire research.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.530
Anna Ruby Campground.
That's where my parents died.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.681
I know.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.684
It wasn't an animal attack, was it?

26:35.880 --> 26:37.689
I found them, Aaron.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.765
I found you next to their bodies.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.090
As soon as I saw them,
I knew that vampires had attacked them.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.406
Ugh.

26:46.600 --> 26:49.251
That's why I continued your father's work.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.922
So this could never happen again.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.690
I hope you'll join me.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.562
So try not to be mad at me.

27:26.400 --> 27:28.368
I got in here while you were unconscious.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.210
Then Caroline locked us inside.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.447
It was the only way.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.881
Let me out of here. Caroline!

27:35.560 --> 27:37.961
I know it's a little extreme.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.811
But the baby-steps approach
wasn't working.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.810
See, that's why I need you
not to get mad at me.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.325
Because when you get mad you get anxious
and violent and you rip people's heads off.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.005
But I'm gonna help you fix that.

27:53.160 --> 27:56.687
Caroline, get me out of here
before I hurt her.

27:56.880 --> 27:58.530
That's the whole point, Stefan.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.087
You need to get over your PTSD triggers.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.608
Okay? Or else you will kill me.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.320
You're risking your life.

28:05.520 --> 28:09.525
I'm already dying, you idiot.
You're the one who wants to keep me alive.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.529
It's my turn to help you now.

28:11.720 --> 28:13.722
I can't be in here. Please.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.562
You're Stefan Salvatore. Suck it up.

28:17.760 --> 28:19.728
No. No. No.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.843
Wes is gonna come back down here...

28:24.040 --> 28:26.771
and we'll both be
the newest Augustine experiment.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.691
You have to tell me how you
got out of here, Damon.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.245
You don't wanna know, Elena.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.920
Why? Do you think
that I'm gonna judge you?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.722
Damon, I love you.

28:41.920 --> 28:46.050
I love you and these people tortured you
for five years.

28:46.280 --> 28:49.090
Whatever you had to do, I don't care.

28:50.800 --> 28:52.290
All right.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.085
All right.

28:58.400 --> 29:02.121
The Augustines' next party was in 1958.

29:03.240 --> 29:05.561
<i>I'd been drinking Enzo's rations
for an entire year.</i>

29:05.800 --> 29:08.929
<i>I mean, he kept a few drops
here and there so he wouldn't desiccate.</i>

29:09.120 --> 29:12.522
<i>And as he starved himself I got stronger
from all the extra blood.</i>

29:12.760 --> 29:13.921
<i>Just like he said I would.</i>

29:14.120 --> 29:17.408
Ladies and gentlemen, as it is almost
midnight, I think it fitting...

29:17.600 --> 29:21.366
we toast the new year
with a glass of vampire blood.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.607
Wouldn't you agree?

29:42.280 --> 29:43.406
Now you see it.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.963
Run! Run!

30:16.360 --> 30:18.328
Damon, we gotta get out of here.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.651
Damon, now! Let's go.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.606
Vervain.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.681
Come on, pull, you can do it.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.808
Enzo trusted me with his life.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.005
The fire was getting out of control. I would've
burned or they would have captured me.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.124
There's no way I would've ever
gotten another chance to escape.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.168
So I chose to save myself.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.610
Damon.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.730
I'm sorry, Enzo.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.731
Damon, please.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.045
Then I knew if I was gonna save myself
I had to stop caring about Enzo.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.529
So I turned off my emotions.

31:18.040 --> 31:20.361
No, no, don't leave me here.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.444
Don't go. Please!

31:25.200 --> 31:26.247
Damon!

31:26.480 --> 31:27.880
<i>DAMON'.
And I left my friend to die.</i>

31:28.040 --> 31:31.567
Please, don't leave me! Damon!

31:31.760 --> 31:33.205
Damon!

31:33.400 --> 31:35.482
Damon! Damon!

31:38.880 --> 31:41.406
After that, everything was fine.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.482
Everything was fine.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.765
- How's it going in there?
- I can't breathe.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.560
I feel like I'm dying.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.485
So I've been using this time to think.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.924
I think there is actually a little bit
of truth to this doppelganger prophecy.

32:13.120 --> 32:16.169
I think you're still in love with Elena.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.808
I think you're miserable about the fact
that she chose Damon over you...

32:20.040 --> 32:23.044
and that you wanna get out
of this one-horse town...

32:23.240 --> 32:26.244
and as far away from their happiness
as possible.

32:26.480 --> 32:30.769
And yet, somehow, you keep finding excuses
to stay in Mystic Falls.

32:31.560 --> 32:33.528
I think I'm just that latest excuse.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.486
I'm gonna kill you.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.441
Good. Yeah, get it all out, Stefan.
I think this is healthy

32:41.080 --> 32:44.607
Although, don't forget
you loved me before you hated me.

32:44.840 --> 32:47.889
Any reason you chose to have this
conversation with me locked in a safe?

32:48.080 --> 32:52.165
Yes. So that I could show you
that the safe isn't the problem.

32:52.400 --> 32:53.731
How could you say that to me?

32:53.960 --> 32:57.123
The problem
is you're not facing your real issues.

32:58.440 --> 33:02.650
The death that you felt in the safe?
The pain of dying over and over again.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.650
It's easier for you to focus
on the physical pain...

33:05.840 --> 33:08.366
than the emotional heartbreak
of Elena leaving you.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.680
Your problem is you're not in touch
with the reality of the moment.

33:13.360 --> 33:17.365
So let's bring you back into the present,
shall we?

33:18.040 --> 33:19.849
In this moment...

33:20.040 --> 33:22.168
are you going to feed on me...

33:22.360 --> 33:24.840
or are you going to save my life?

33:32.840 --> 33:34.251
Fight it, Stefan.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.884
Fight it.

33:38.840 --> 33:40.524
I'm here.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.370
I'm here.

33:44.520 --> 33:46.284
I'm with you.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.566
We're together.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.409
It was so quiet, I got worried.

34:16.840 --> 34:20.161
See? You made it out alive.

34:29.000 --> 34:31.810
- What the hell is this place?
- Aaron?

34:33.000 --> 34:35.128
Great, mini-Wes.

34:35.320 --> 34:38.483
I had no idea what Wes was doing.
I didn't know there was a basement.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.848
- You have to help us.
- I wanna know the truth.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.728
When you met me at Megan's memorial,
you asked me a bunch of questions.

34:46.679 --> 34:47.966
Slick hands, cowboy.

34:48.159 --> 34:52.165
Well, I've never used a gun before. And I've
never killed anyone, either. Unlike you.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.811
What are you talking about?

34:54.000 --> 34:56.002
Wes said a vampire killed Megan.

34:57.360 --> 34:59.249
- And you thought it was Elena?
- No.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.810
Megan was inside this house.
I hadn't even been invited yet.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.480
Wes also said
that a vampire killed my parents.

35:05.680 --> 35:08.411
- Maybe that was you too.
- No. Aaron, that's impossible, I...

35:08.640 --> 35:10.881
- Why would you be so interested in me?
- Calm down.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.804
Why would you pretend to be my friend?

35:13.040 --> 35:16.522
- She's a vampire.
- Not the one that killed your parents.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.524
That was all me.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.201
What did you just say?

35:30.200 --> 35:32.407
- Start talking.
- Damon, what are you doing?

35:34.200 --> 35:37.886
In 1958, after the fire, Enzo was dead.

35:38.120 --> 35:40.282
So I had to take all my revenge plans solo.

35:40.520 --> 35:44.923
Yeah, I see it. I can see it.

35:50.240 --> 35:54.529
After I take out the entire Augustine society,
I'll kill every member of the Whitmore family.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.246
Boo. I said use your imagination.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.250
Except one person.

36:00.440 --> 36:02.807
I'll let that person grow up.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.088
And start a family.

36:05.720 --> 36:07.802
And then I'll start
killing Whitmores again.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.721
And I'll take out the
generation after that...

36:11.920 --> 36:15.447
leaving only one person
to carry on the name.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.047
And then I'll take out the generation
after that.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.770
And so on.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.564
And so on.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.603
And so on.

36:25.880 --> 36:27.882
That's exactly what I did.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.162
How many Whitmores have you killed?

36:33.360 --> 36:34.725
Since 1958?

36:35.760 --> 36:36.966
I lost count.

36:39.120 --> 36:40.326
When was the last one?

36:42.280 --> 36:44.726
Damon, when was the last one?

36:45.400 --> 36:46.640
A few months ago.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.131
Her name was Sara.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.007
Had to go all the way to Charleston
to find her.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.201
It was a weekend trip. You didn't know.

36:57.440 --> 37:01.081
- But we were together a few months ago.
- Starting the summer of our lives.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.611
I had no idea.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.206
Told you it wasn't pretty.

37:09.120 --> 37:10.451
No!

37:20.240 --> 37:21.526
A little help here!

37:21.720 --> 37:24.803
I mean, I know I'm a vampire,
but this thing is really heavy.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.769
Stefan?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.290
Hello?

37:40.640 --> 37:44.690
You know, for the record,
I, uh, only broke one of these.

37:44.920 --> 37:48.447
It was an ugly chair.
You're better off without it.

37:50.480 --> 37:54.121
So I guess you were right all along.

37:54.760 --> 37:59.004
It was easier for me to focus
on my physical pain than the breakup.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.284
I need to move on.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.442
So you admit it.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.722
I do know what I'm doing.

38:06.960 --> 38:11.841
To be honest with you, I never know
exactly what you're doing, Katherine.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.001
Well, Stefan...

38:17.520 --> 38:21.127
sometimes I don't either.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.687
Like right now.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.884
For example.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.962
Hey, Elena, uh, I'm probably
gonna stay at my mom's tonight.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.771
I think I am officially homesick.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.928
So I'll let you know when I'm...

39:40.360 --> 39:41.771
Stefan.

39:41.960 --> 39:45.965
Oh, my God.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.569
Call me as soon as you get this.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.205
I'm sorry you had to find out
about your parents like this.

39:52.400 --> 39:54.687
I found out that I've been lied to
my entire life.

39:54.880 --> 39:57.884
What the hell is going on?
Are their friends gonna come after me?

39:58.120 --> 40:00.885
- I mean, do I need to drop out?
- You'll <i>be</i> fine.

40:01.120 --> 40:06.411
Just go to school, live your life.
Talk to you soon.

40:31.280 --> 40:33.760
Oh. Guess I had that coming.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.290
Elena.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.164
Elena?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.251
Elena?

40:47.320 --> 40:50.483
Elena? Elena?

41:10.120 --> 41:12.043
What's happening?

41:14.760 --> 41:16.285
Ah.

41:17.480 --> 41:18.845
Welcome.

41:19.040 --> 41:21.281
I'm 12144.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.405
My name is Enzo.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.122
Out in the moonlight

41:34.320 --> 41:36.368
<i>Just like we used to do</i>

41:36.560 --> 41:38.562
<i>I'm always walkin'</i>

41:39.200 --> 41:43.046
<i>After midnight
Searchin' for you</i>
