Yikes! Your arm!

Now there's nothing

Don't worry. I'll get you out.

Steven out of here!

01:07.200 --> 01:09.368
I'm sending you back

But, Garnet, how are
you gonna ...

01:11.538 --> 01:13.372
Huh?

01:13.423 --> 01:16.625
- You can bubble me?
- Garnet, no!

01:16.710 --> 01:19.294
Garnet!

01:19.379 --> 01:21.213
Watch your head.

01:29.639 --> 01:31.427
Whoa!

01:31.428 --> 01:34.109
I'm back inside the temple.

01:34.194 --> 01:38.397
Look at you now, stuck in a bubble.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.149
Hmm.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.402
Let me see if I can...

01:47.914 --> 01:51.293
Yeah!
Wha...? Ugh! Whoa!

01:51.377 --> 01:54.296
Wha!

01:54.380 --> 01:55.881
Whew.
Huh?

01:55.965 --> 01:59.251
Oh, man.

Huh?

02:27.247 --> 02:33.335
It looks... so scared.
Uh... Hi.

02:33.419 --> 02:37.172
Aw, it's okay.
Look, please don't be

02:37.257 --> 02:40.876
scared of me.
See? I'm not gonna hurt you.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.296
Yeah. Just relax.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.432
Yeah. That's it.

02:47.467 --> 02:49.361
Doesn't relaxing feel nice?

02:49.362 --> 02:53.806
You want to... come over
here and relax with me?

02:53.873 --> 02:57.953
Yeah, we can totally
just hang out right here on the floor.

02:59.479 --> 03:02.748
Yeah. Don't be shy.
We can be friends.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.367
- My name's Steven.
- Steven!

03:05.451 --> 03:08.654
- Get away from that thing!
- Whoa, dude!

03:08.738 --> 03:11.623
Wait! It's not ...

03:11.658 --> 03:14.009
This was a terrible
idea. And he's even

03:14.010 --> 03:16.411
managed to pop a bubble
and let out that awful...

03:16.496 --> 03:21.133
thing!

03:21.167 --> 03:23.502
If that thing hurt
you, so help me, I'll ...

03:23.553 --> 03:26.171
No!
It didn't do anything!

03:26.256 --> 03:28.807
Garnet!
Don't hurt it!

03:28.842 --> 03:31.481
I accidentally let it
out of its bubble, but it

03:31.482 --> 03:34.229
didn't even try to hurt
me. It's not like the other

03:34.314 --> 03:37.683
monsters.
It's just scared and confused.

03:37.767 --> 03:40.652
Please, Garnet, I'm begging you.

03:44.994 --> 03:47.029
I can't say no to
that face.

03:47.163 --> 03:49.698
Excuse me?!
You can't be serious!

03:49.782 --> 03:52.834
I think you should
try and tame it, Steven.

03:52.869 --> 03:55.871
Garnet, thank you so
much!

03:55.922 --> 03:59.207
Hmmm.

03:59.292 --> 04:02.794
Shut down by the G-squad!

04:02.879 --> 04:05.714
Well, let's at least
take some precaution.

04:05.798 --> 04:08.266
All right, Steven,
let's see if you can get it

04:08.351 --> 04:12.466
- to calm down.
- Um...It still seems a little scared.

04:16.392 --> 04:19.269
Maybe you guys could
put your weapons

04:19.274 --> 04:22.531
- away and watch from the house...?
- Absolutely not!

04:22.565 --> 04:24.366
Steven can handle this.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.368
- Garnet!
- Pearl.

04:26.402 --> 04:28.904
Oh!

04:28.988 --> 04:33.408
You just got Garneted!

04:33.493 --> 04:36.378
Okay, friend, it's
just us now.

04:36.412 --> 04:41.750
Calmy calm. Calm.
Just like before. Yeah.

04:41.834 --> 04:44.753
Just relax and let your hair down.

04:44.837 --> 04:48.757
You want to come over here?
Huh? Don't worry.

04:48.808 --> 04:53.395
It won't be like before.
How about we try something else?

04:53.479 --> 04:56.598
Hmm...
Oh! What's this?

04:56.682 --> 05:00.602
Chiiiiips?
You like chiiips?

05:00.686 --> 05:04.272
You want a chiiips?
Yeah? Yeah?

05:04.357 --> 05:09.661
Aw, look at this chiiiip.
Yum, yum, yum!

05:09.745 --> 05:15.000
Mmmm! Tasty, tasty!
Hmm? Try it.

05:15.084 --> 05:19.454
That's it.
Smells good, right?

05:20.873 --> 05:23.542
I don't know how you
eat with an eyeball in your

05:23.626 --> 05:27.963
mouth, but I'm glad you like it.
Hmm? Hmmm?

06:38.767 --> 06:42.003
Aw, come on, Pearl.
She can help us on, like,

06:42.071 --> 06:44.072
- missions and stuff.
- Oh, no.

06:44.173 --> 06:47.442
- Out of the question.
- Aww.

06:47.509 --> 06:49.677
Well, we can't return to the ice

06:49.745 --> 06:51.312
cavern now.
We have to stay and deal with

06:51.380 --> 06:55.191
- Steven and his... situation.
- Well, I don't know how we're

06:55.226 --> 06:56.751
gonna get through all
those ice boulders without

06:56.819 --> 06:59.704
- causing a cave-in anyway.
- Hmm.

06:59.788 --> 07:02.857

the Shooting Star!

08:03.719 --> 08:07.766

so hot and so volatile,

08:07.767 --> 08:10.465
it can only be contained in ice.

08:10.466 --> 08:15.663
- Bare skin cannot endure its intensity.
- What do you do

08:15.698 --> 08:17.699
- wih a Shooting Star?
- Uh, you shoot it.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.890
Garnet, you'll need to use your

08:19.891 --> 08:22.086
gauntlets so as not to hurt your hands.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.793
No! No, no! Not now!

08:28.877 --> 08:32.880
Something's wrong.

08:37.102 --> 08:40.888
Whoa!

08:41.972 --> 08:43.057
Steven!

08:43.192 --> 08:46.310
I knew this would happen!

08:53.285 --> 08:57.071
Pearl, stop!
It was an accident!

08:59.124 --> 09:01.242
- Sorry for pulling.
- Steven!

09:01.326 --> 09:05.046
No!

09:15.758 --> 09:18.259
Stop!

09:18.360 --> 09:21.145
You don't need to fight!

09:21.230 --> 09:25.099
This isn't you.
You're not a monster anymore.

09:25.150 --> 09:27.001
You're more than that.

09:27.102 --> 09:30.605
We have so many memories now.

09:30.689 --> 09:33.991
Remember the chip times?

09:34.076 --> 09:36.778
And how you saved me
from that vicious seagull?

09:36.862 --> 09:39.937
And how we became best friends?

09:39.938 --> 09:42.083
You have to remember!

09:42.117 --> 09:45.353
This all happened today!

09:53.178 --> 09:56.130
Huh?

10:00.856 --> 10:02.937
Nooooo!

10:06.475 --> 10:09.227
Nooo!

10:20.405 --> 10:23.658
- You saved me.
- Steven, you did a

10:23.792 --> 10:25.827
good job training the Centipeetle.

10:25.911 --> 10:28.212
Your mother would be so proud.

10:28.297 --> 10:31.869
- She would?
- The truth is, Rose Quartz

10:31.904 --> 10:33.501
had tried to use her
powers to save these monsters,

10:33.552 --> 10:36.387
too, but she was never able to
heal them.

10:36.471 --> 10:39.674
Never?
But if she couldn't do it...

10:39.758 --> 10:41.843
Who knows?
Maybe when you have better

10:41.927 --> 10:44.846
control of your powers, you
might help them in ways

10:44.930 --> 10:47.849
- even your mother couldn't.
- Even this one.

10:47.933 --> 10:50.985
I'll keep it safe.

10:51.019 --> 10:54.238
- Wow!
- Steven! You can bubble gems!

10:54.323 --> 10:58.860
Wow.
Wait for me, Centipeetle.

10:58.911 --> 11:01.612
I promise I'll heal you up someday.

11:03.332 --> 11:04.699
Ooh! Wait!
