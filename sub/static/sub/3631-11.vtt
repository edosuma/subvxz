<i>Previously on " Bitten"...</i>

00:02.320 --> 00:04.074
Yesterday I got this.

00:04.098 --> 00:05.664
Thing is, no one knows we're pregnant,

00:05.666 --> 00:06.932
let alone that it's a boy.

00:06.934 --> 00:08.466
That's Braxton's truck, all right.

00:08.468 --> 00:09.835
Are we being accused of something here?

00:09.837 --> 00:11.069
There's a trail of blood,

00:11.071 --> 00:12.737
leads from his truck towards your land.

00:12.739 --> 00:14.239
He could be out here somewhere,

00:14.241 --> 00:15.841
injured or incapacitated.

00:15.843 --> 00:16.874
This is?

00:16.876 --> 00:18.276
This is my cousin Clay.

00:18.278 --> 00:19.511
Clay, this is Philip.

00:19.775 --> 00:21.474
I don't understand.

00:21.476 --> 00:22.475
Who bit you?

00:22.477 --> 00:24.243
You afraid of the big bad wolf?

00:24.245 --> 00:25.946
(Groans)

00:28.610 --> 00:30.511
Clay: Philip's client, James Williams?

00:30.513 --> 00:32.445
He's the top patron of this gallery.

00:32.448 --> 00:34.215
He sponsored your show, Elena.

00:34.217 --> 00:35.883
To drop Olson in your lap.

00:37.186 --> 00:40.221
Smells like they've been
gone for at least a day.

00:40.223 --> 00:42.089
They've been watching us. In Toronto.

00:42.091 --> 00:44.024
It's not just you the Mutts are after.

00:44.026 --> 00:45.359
It's Elena.

00:45.361 --> 00:47.228
My family in New York aren't...

00:47.230 --> 00:48.896
my family by blood.

00:50.065 --> 00:51.264
What about Clay?

00:51.266 --> 00:52.599
I see the way you are together.

00:52.601 --> 00:54.768
I saw the goddamn photo
at Logan's, Elena.

Everything's on edge over here, Jeremy.

01:18.727 --> 01:21.027
She's had a lot thrown
at her, now this too and...

01:22.396 --> 01:25.198
It won't be easy to
convince her. She's...

01:25.200 --> 01:26.866
She's emotional right now.

01:28.202 --> 01:30.336
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

01:32.840 --> 01:36.042
I can't reach Philip.

01:36.044 --> 01:38.177
It looks like you got what you wanted.

01:38.179 --> 01:40.446
You're hurting. I'd never want that.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.314
What do you want, Clay?

01:42.316 --> 01:44.550
Tell me once and for all how you
think this is going to play out.

01:44.552 --> 01:46.885
I don't know. We're under attack.

01:46.887 --> 01:49.020
Right now, that's all I care about.

01:50.657 --> 01:53.158
Jeremy and Nick found Joey Stillwell.
Alive.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.660
He led them to the Mutts' hideout,

01:54.662 --> 01:56.661
an abandoned warehouse
outside of Bear Valley.

01:56.663 --> 01:58.496
Marsten and LeBlanc?
Tell me they got them.

01:58.498 --> 02:00.966
Long gone. Jeremy will fill us in

02:00.968 --> 02:02.367
when he and Nick get here.

02:02.369 --> 02:04.669
They... they're coming to Toronto?

02:04.671 --> 02:08.139
The Mutts... they want us
separated, chasing after them.

02:08.142 --> 02:11.609
We get Logan, we go back
to Stonehaven as a Pack.

02:11.611 --> 02:13.678
We can't be apart anymore.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.414
- What about Rachel?
- Logan will get her someplace safe.

02:18.150 --> 02:19.651
I need to find Philip.

02:19.653 --> 02:21.018
You can't leave.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.754
If he isn't back by
the time we're ready,

02:22.756 --> 02:23.954
we'll just have to go.

02:23.956 --> 02:25.390
It won't be easy.

02:29.161 --> 02:31.295
I don't need your advice

02:31.297 --> 02:33.363
on how to break someone's heart.

02:38.636 --> 02:40.237

03:10.435 --> 03:11.935
<i>I've been calling you all morning.</i>

03:11.937 --> 03:13.236
I just got home, my phone was dead.

03:13.238 --> 03:14.570
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm at the gallery.</i>

03:14.572 --> 03:16.306
You won't believe
what happened last night.

03:16.308 --> 03:18.107
Some jerk went after
Elena. Philip went nuts

03:18.109 --> 03:19.508
and beat the hell out of the guy.

03:19.510 --> 03:22.578
It was crazy. Everyone's
a little freaked out.

03:22.580 --> 03:23.946
Just... hold on.

03:23.948 --> 03:25.348
Can I help you?

03:25.350 --> 03:28.016
What a lovely collection of photographs.

03:31.054 --> 03:32.755
Elena Michaels.

03:32.757 --> 03:35.523
- Rachel, Rachel, listen to me!
<i>- The event...</i>

03:35.525 --> 03:36.992
...was last night.

03:36.994 --> 03:38.327
I can get you the organizer's number.

Oh, I'd much prefer
to deal with the artist.

<i>Do you know where I might contact her?</i>

03:42.066 --> 03:44.166

Diane McAdams can answer

03:51.708 --> 03:53.375
Logan: (On phone) <i>Rachel!</i>

03:54.844 --> 03:56.578
Tell me, have we met before?

03:56.580 --> 03:59.381
- I don't think so.
- See, I'm very good with faces

03:59.383 --> 04:01.683
and your face is distinctly memorable.

04:01.685 --> 04:03.351
Striking, in fact.

04:03.353 --> 04:05.253
(High-pitched tone) Logan:
<i>Rachel! Listen to me!</i>

04:05.255 --> 04:06.554
Thank you.

04:06.556 --> 04:08.822
But we're actually closed,
and I need to clean up.

04:08.824 --> 04:10.557
(Crunching)

04:10.559 --> 04:12.894
Seems like it was quite the event.

04:12.896 --> 04:14.762
<i>Rachel!</i>

04:14.764 --> 04:18.165
I believe someone is yelling
into your hand, my dear.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.301
It must be terribly important.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.337
I won't bother you any further.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.173
Sorry, that was...

04:27.175 --> 04:28.709
<i>That was just a potential buyer.</i>

04:28.711 --> 04:31.779
Ok... Ok... okay, okay.
J... just... come home. Now.

04:31.781 --> 04:33.547
This place is a disaster.

04:33.549 --> 04:35.382
<i>Leave it. I'll help you with that later.</i>

04:35.384 --> 04:38.285
I just... I got a surprise here for you.

04:38.287 --> 04:40.454
I... it's... What is it?

04:40.456 --> 04:42.555
Just... You'll see when you get here.

04:42.557 --> 04:45.591
<i>Come here, straight here.</i>
<i>Don't stop for anything.</i>

04:45.593 --> 04:47.994
Okay. Weird, but okay.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.695
Okay, stay on the phone.

04:49.697 --> 04:51.664
Tell me about what happened last night.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.200
<i>Well, the night was going great,
until this guy showed up,</i>

04:54.202 --> 04:55.635
<i>redhead, real creep...</i>

04:59.039 --> 05:00.306
We're all set.

05:00.308 --> 05:01.974
I put Joey on the 8:30 to Vancouver.

05:01.976 --> 05:03.676
Jorge knows to get him?

05:03.678 --> 05:04.977
He'll be there waiting.

05:04.979 --> 05:06.913
It's going to take a little while

05:06.915 --> 05:08.714
until Joey gets his head right again.

05:08.716 --> 05:10.215
You and I need to go to Toronto.

05:10.217 --> 05:12.117
I don't want Elena travelling,
or out in the open,

05:12.119 --> 05:13.986
without three of us
there to protect her.

05:13.988 --> 05:16.121
If the Mutts want her,
they go through us.

05:16.123 --> 05:18.290
- And Logan?
- We'll bring him back too.

05:18.292 --> 05:20.025
We all need to be in this together.

05:20.027 --> 05:21.393
(Knocking on door)

05:29.336 --> 05:32.003
- Sheriff?
- Mr. Danvers, I'm glad you're here.

05:32.005 --> 05:33.738
Well, unfortunately we
were just about to leave.

05:33.740 --> 05:35.574
Oh, I doubt you're going
to want to go anywhere.

05:35.576 --> 05:37.943
In about an hour,
a half dozen FBI agents

05:37.945 --> 05:39.578

05:39.580 --> 05:41.245
are going to be all over your property.

05:41.247 --> 05:43.181
- FBI? Why?
- We have a lead

05:43.183 --> 05:45.316
in Michael Braxton's murder. It's a...

05:45.318 --> 05:47.085
It's a much bigger case
than we first thought.

05:47.087 --> 05:49.720
- In what way? - It's
linked to a number of other homicides.

05:49.722 --> 05:53.191
I told them they could rely
on your full cooperation.

05:53.193 --> 05:55.360

State forensics found
fingerprints on the body.

06:53.918 --> 06:57.586
They uploaded it to a national

07:12.837 --> 07:15.904
- The name mean anything to you?
- No.

07:15.906 --> 07:18.841
He's a 35-year-old medical
technician from Rockford, Illinois.

07:18.843 --> 07:22.277
About a year ago, he was linked
to several rapes and murders

07:22.279 --> 07:24.179
in and around the Midwest.

07:24.181 --> 07:25.947
And what is he doing in Bear Valley?

07:25.949 --> 07:27.482
Good question.

07:27.484 --> 07:30.852
Also, why did he dump the
body so close to Stonehaven?

07:30.854 --> 07:34.089
Um... Well, we had
a number of wolf attacks

07:34.091 --> 07:35.756
that were in the newspaper.

07:35.758 --> 07:38.325
Maybe he was hoping to ride
that wave of attention,

07:38.327 --> 07:40.060
make some sort of grand statement.

07:40.062 --> 07:43.163
It's just kind of strange.
He only killed women.

07:43.165 --> 07:44.799
Went to great pains to hide their body.

07:44.801 --> 07:47.201
And now he kills a man and
leaves him for us to find?

07:47.203 --> 07:50.337
Serial killers don't normally
change their patterns like that.

07:52.140 --> 07:54.875
He's clearly deranged.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.877
I really don't know what he's thinking.

07:56.879 --> 07:59.413
And I don't see how
searching my property again

07:59.415 --> 08:01.081

08:01.083 --> 08:04.018
Braxton's body was dragged to

08:04.020 --> 08:05.585

08:05.587 --> 08:07.421
There were plants, dirt and
microscopic this and that

that can link us to LeBlanc.

08:13.529 --> 08:16.229

he's long gone by now?

08:16.231 --> 08:17.597

What's that supposed to mean?

- He's not important enough?
- Not to them.

09:26.185 --> 09:28.118

09:28.119 --> 09:30.453
like biting the man who hurt
you when you were a child.

You don't know what he's planning.

09:42.359 --> 09:45.093

- Jamaica.

22:04.764 --> 22:08.298

I don't know about you.

22:10.230 --> 22:12.765
I'm sorry, Philip.

22:12.766 --> 22:15.333
I also realized that I want
to spend the rest of my life

22:15.334 --> 22:18.368
getting to know you. I can
leave all this behind,

22:18.369 --> 22:20.170
we can move to London, to New York,

22:20.171 --> 22:21.904
to Los Angeles, I don't care.

22:21.905 --> 22:24.305
Nobody has to know where we are.

22:28.238 --> 22:30.506
You can't...

22:30.507 --> 22:32.273
You'd never see your family again.

22:32.274 --> 22:35.409
So be it. I'm in love with you.

22:35.410 --> 22:37.076
The one in those tiny moments,

22:37.077 --> 22:39.077
and there's nothing
that you could tell me

22:39.078 --> 22:40.378
that could change that.

22:48.103 --> 22:50.371
I want you to marry me.

23:00.988 --> 23:04.457
I love you too.

23:04.458 --> 23:07.192

LeBlanc crossed the border
into Canada at Niagara Falls.

23:54.510 --> 23:56.877
The FBI is coordinating
with the RCMP to track him.

23:56.879 --> 24:00.013
I have to admit that I'm glad to
hear he's no longer in Bear Valley.

24:00.015 --> 24:01.482
The agents have finished their survey.

24:01.484 --> 24:03.851
They've taped off the
areas you should avoid.

24:03.853 --> 24:07.287
Unfortunately, I'm getting used
to police tape on my property.

24:07.289 --> 24:09.222
You've been very helpful.

24:09.224 --> 24:11.691

might seem a little strange

24:38.152 --> 24:40.386

24:47.295 --> 24:50.296

We have to go, now.

24:53.300 --> 24:54.666
I need your advice.

24:54.668 --> 24:56.200

different cabs to get here

25:04.478 --> 25:06.812

I, we have to disappear.

25:06.814 --> 25:09.147

we're all together, Logan.

the Pack, from Jeremy.

25:12.618 --> 25:14.518

25:14.520 --> 25:16.454
- I need you.
- I can't!

25:16.456 --> 25:18.122
I don't know what else to do.

25:18.124 --> 25:20.158
You're the one that convinced
me to come back to Stonehaven.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.726
You gave me that speech
about family obligation.

25:22.728 --> 25:24.562
Do you think this
isn't tearing me apart?

25:24.564 --> 25:26.331
I owe everything to Jeremy.

25:26.333 --> 25:28.298
But that woman upstairs, I love her

25:28.300 --> 25:30.434
and I'm not going to
take her child away.

25:31.603 --> 25:33.036
I'm going to be a father.

25:33.038 --> 25:35.372
This is my family.

25:35.374 --> 25:37.341
It's the goddamn definition.

25:44.274 --> 25:47.076
Okay. I'll do what I can.

25:48.425 --> 25:51.360
She'll listen to you. Just...

25:51.361 --> 25:54.061

you don't have much time.

25:54.062 --> 25:55.896

Logan's been saying.

26:15.146 --> 26:16.612

- I believe it.

26:16.614 --> 26:18.214
You should too.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.315
It's our family.

26:24.316 --> 26:27.651
We haven't told you everything.

26:27.652 --> 26:31.788
There are some very, very bad
people that want to hurt us.

26:31.789 --> 26:35.189
(Scoffing) You make it sound like
it's the mafia or something.

26:35.190 --> 26:37.224
It's not that far off.

26:38.758 --> 26:41.327
Our cousin wasn't injured
in a car accident.

26:41.328 --> 26:43.895
It was murder. And there are others,

26:43.896 --> 26:46.997
people very close to us. Family.

26:46.998 --> 26:50.432
The only way you're going to be
safe is if you stay with Logan.

26:50.433 --> 26:52.400
Oh my god...

26:52.401 --> 26:54.801
- Oh my god...
- You have to go into hiding, okay?

26:54.802 --> 26:57.236
Someplace where they won't look for you.

26:57.237 --> 26:58.670
Our family will take care of this

26:58.671 --> 27:00.504
and you can come back when it's safe.

27:00.505 --> 27:02.405
My family, my sister...

27:02.406 --> 27:04.305
Elena, I'm having a baby.

27:04.306 --> 27:05.939
Everything will be okay.

But you have to trust
Logan, he knows what to do.

27:16.950 --> 27:19.551
She's packing. Do you
know where you're going?

27:19.552 --> 27:21.585
Jamaica. What about you?

27:21.586 --> 27:24.053
I'm going back to Stonehaven.

27:24.054 --> 27:26.254
Look, once this is done,
I'll talk to Jeremy

27:26.255 --> 27:28.856
- and I'll explain your side.
- He's never going to let me back in.

27:28.857 --> 27:30.957
I'm going to be a Mutt,
just like the rest of them.

27:30.958 --> 27:33.058
Just like my father. It's Pack Law.

27:33.059 --> 27:35.993
Jeremy will understand, okay?
He always has.

27:35.994 --> 27:38.228
It's different for you,
you know that, right?

27:38.229 --> 27:39.661
No, I don't believe that.

27:39.662 --> 27:41.429
Listen, ever since
you came to Stonehaven,

27:41.430 --> 27:43.230
everything changed. He changed.

27:43.231 --> 27:45.097
That's why you had to come back.
You're important.

27:45.098 --> 27:47.098
Well then, you're just
as important to him as I am.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.598
He's not going to turn you away.

27:48.599 --> 27:49.966
What about Rachel?

27:49.967 --> 27:53.001
How accepting is he going to be of her?

27:53.002 --> 27:56.136
Logan, maybe this is...
this is the reason to change.

27:56.137 --> 27:57.937
You know, evolve.

27:57.938 --> 28:00.806
It's not like those dusty
scrolls of the Legacy anymore.

28:00.807 --> 28:02.740
It's time to come up with new rules.

28:02.741 --> 28:04.574
If we don't change...

28:04.575 --> 28:07.543
the Pack, all of us, we'll...

28:07.544 --> 28:10.511
we're going to die off.

28:10.512 --> 28:12.578
Maybe you should be Alpha.

28:12.579 --> 28:14.980
(Scoffs)
Yeah, right.

28:17.097 --> 28:19.098
I'm going to miss you.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.367
Hey...

28:22.369 --> 28:23.802
No, you're not.

28:23.804 --> 28:25.671
We're going to keep in touch, okay?

28:25.673 --> 28:28.107
No matter where you are,
I want you to call.

28:28.109 --> 28:30.609
We're in this together, right?

28:30.611 --> 28:32.377
Right.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.512
Be safe.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.214
You too.

28:39.234 --> 28:41.068
Clay: We can't involve the police.

28:41.069 --> 28:42.628
Philip: She could be anywhere!

28:42.629 --> 28:44.228
This is a nightmare!

28:44.229 --> 28:46.529
You got her involved with
a bunch of criminals.

28:46.530 --> 28:48.096
That's why we have to find her.

28:48.097 --> 28:50.564
She's in danger because of me.
It's my fault.

28:50.565 --> 28:52.798
Well, at least you admit it.

28:52.799 --> 28:54.866
She fell in love with the wrong guy.

28:56.589 --> 28:59.795
She was young, in university...

28:59.796 --> 29:02.697
It hit us both. Way too fast.

29:02.698 --> 29:05.198
I wanted to keep her out
of my family's business.

29:06.102 --> 29:07.311
But... I...

29:07.312 --> 29:09.345
I don't know what I was thinking.

29:09.346 --> 29:11.145
I can't believe she'd stay with you.

29:11.146 --> 29:14.014
She didn't. She tried to get away.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.588
- Not far enough.
- What about now?

29:17.589 --> 29:19.322
Are you still in love with her?

29:19.323 --> 29:21.990
- It doesn't matter what I feel.
- It matters to me.

29:21.991 --> 29:26.093
I want her to live her life without
looking over her shoulder.

29:26.094 --> 29:28.161
I want her to be happy.

29:28.162 --> 29:30.229

- Who's coming?
- My family.

29:50.515 --> 29:53.416

- Yes.
