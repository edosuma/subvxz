of the 160‐point inspection.

18:35.925 --> 18:39.229
Oh, that was when I was writing
homosexual stuff on the boat.

18:39.229 --> 18:41.598
‐Too bad about the bomb.
‐Bomb?

18:41.598 --> 18:43.333
Yep. Right here on the boat.

18:43.333 --> 18:46.336
Soon you will all do
the foamy dance of death.

18:46.336 --> 18:49.839
We are!
And many people will die.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.908
He just says that one thing.

18:53.743 --> 18:57.113
(dance music playing)

18:57.113 --> 18:59.949
(gasps)
The bomb is hidden in the foam.

19:04.721 --> 19:07.323
‐Where is it?
Have you found it? ‐No.

19:07.323 --> 19:10.026
I was thinking next Thursday
for Epcot, but no bomb.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.562
You're wasting your time;
the bomb will activate

19:12.562 --> 19:14.364
the moment the floor
stops vibrating.

19:14.364 --> 19:16.733
(gasps)
Did you hear that? Twerk!

19:16.733 --> 19:18.468
Twerk like you're Miley Cyrus

19:18.468 --> 19:20.303
trying to prove something
to your dad!

19:20.303 --> 19:22.338
(whooping and cheering)

19:28.645 --> 19:30.313
Found it!

19:30.313 --> 19:33.750
‐(music stops)
‐(bomb beeping)

19:33.750 --> 19:35.652
‐We're all gonna die!
‐(people gasping)

19:35.652 --> 19:39.355
Oh, no, we're not.
I stole a Jet Ski from a kid.

19:40.890 --> 19:42.659
(beeping continues)

19:48.031 --> 19:49.999
(gasps)
Ha, ha!

19:49.999 --> 19:52.435
(beeping continues)

19:52.435 --> 19:53.903
Oh, I forgot they do that.

19:57.006 --> 19:59.008
Hydraulic grapple‐winch!

19:59.008 --> 20:01.511
‐Oh, yeah!
‐From earlier!

20:03.012 --> 20:05.581
‐(engine revving)
‐(Quagmire gasps)

20:15.425 --> 20:18.361
‐We did it! It's over.
‐'Cause of you.

20:18.361 --> 20:20.615
Thanks for saving us, Quagmire.

20:20.615 --> 20:23.484
Ah, I was just doing my duty.
Just like you did.

20:23.484 --> 20:25.219
Good job, soldier.

20:25.219 --> 20:28.356
Anyway, what matters
is everyone's okay,

20:28.356 --> 20:29.824
thanks to the Coast Guard.

20:29.824 --> 20:31.192
Because when you're here...

20:31.192 --> 20:33.494
‐(gunshot)
‐(Quagmire grunts)

20:33.494 --> 20:37.031
I'm not going back
to that restaurant.

20:43.905 --> 20:46.593
I'm so happy you're back home
where you belong, Peter.

20:46.593 --> 20:48.862
It's just not the same here
without you.

20:48.862 --> 20:51.732
Thanks, Lois. And I thought
about you not at all.

20:51.732 --> 20:54.568
Well, I'm so proud
of my Coast Guard husband.

20:54.568 --> 20:57.338
And I'm proud
of my Coast Guard dad.

20:57.338 --> 21:00.507
And I'm bisexual, like all
members of the Coast Guard.

21:00.507 --> 21:03.944
Good night, Coast Guard.
Hope you enjoyed the episode.
