WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:03.471
It's time to take a stand
with The Gifted.

00:03.504 --> 00:06.006
-People need something
to believe in.
-Ahh!

00:06.040 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:10.010 --> 00:11.579
9-1-1, The Resident,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.880
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.749
-Hey, partner.
-Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.486
I can't make it stop.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.688
Most of Otto's later research
was overseen

00:20.721 --> 00:23.691
by his lab assistant,
Professor Madeline Garber.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.393
Reed. I thought
I'd never see you again.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.661
-What are you doing here?
-I need your help.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.364
The original medication
was like a dam.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.666
But eventually,
the dam will break.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.869
-And then?
-If we don't treat him,
Reed will die.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.506
NOAH: Dr. M is
on the verge of something.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.741
It could be a solution
for all mutants.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.210
Anyone who doesn't want
the X-Gene, or doesn't want it

00:42.243 --> 00:44.678
in their family,
they'd have an answer.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.680
You're going to transform
the world, Lauren.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.582
-Just give her to me.
-How are you gonna
keep her safe?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.684
I'll figure it out.
That's what parents do.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.420
You gonna shoot lasers
at the whole world?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.555
News flash:
it's already on fire.

00:54.588 --> 00:55.923
Yeah, because of you!

00:55.956 --> 00:57.725
BANK MANAGER:
You people are monsters.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.960
All of you deserve to be wiped
from the face of the earth.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.030
(panting)

01:03.063 --> 01:05.766
-What did you do?
-It's been awesome.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.368
SAGE: After what happened,
Reeva's not gonna give up

01:07.401 --> 01:08.902
until she finds Rebecca.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.704
I'm gonna send Fade
and Bulk out, too.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.440
What happens when they find her?

01:12.473 --> 01:13.707
ESME:
That's up to Reeva.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.076
(gasps, choking)

01:16.110 --> 01:19.580
See your hands move,
and I slit your throat.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.819
MR. HOOVER:
Rebecca? Breakfast.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.793
Oh, wow.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.062
-What is the occasion?
-(chuckles)

01:35.095 --> 01:37.731
No-no occasion, honey. I just
thought I'd make pancakes.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.668
Oh.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.576
Cool. Blueberries.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.779
Actually,
it was your dad's idea.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.815
Mm. Hey, what are you
still doing here?

01:54.848 --> 01:56.750
Shouldn't you be on your way
to work by now?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.253
Oh, I have a late meeting.
This side of town.

01:59.287 --> 02:04.758
So I thought it would be nice
to have breakfast as a family.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.460
Okay, whatever.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.462
You guys are acting weird.

02:08.496 --> 02:11.165
I thought I might've gotten
kicked out of school again.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.133
(chuckles):
No.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.702
Oh, good.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.005
(vehicle approaching)

02:20.874 --> 02:21.975
Someone here?

02:22.009 --> 02:24.445
-(car doors closing)
-I didn't hear anything.

02:24.478 --> 02:29.617
I think that might be the
gardener. Let me just check.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.952
Did you want a glass
of milk, maybe?

02:31.985 --> 02:35.823
Um, yeah, sure, uh--
orange juice is okay, too.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.857
GUARD: Sentinel Services.
Keep your hands

02:36.890 --> 02:38.326
where we can see them,
Miss Hoover.

02:38.359 --> 02:40.528
Dad, what are they doing here?

02:40.561 --> 02:43.130
-Mom?
-Just stay calm, Miss Hoover.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.498
(quietly):
You called them.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.201
You called them, didn't you?

02:47.235 --> 02:48.536
(crying)

02:48.569 --> 02:50.137
-Back away from the door.
-No...

02:50.170 --> 02:51.672
Freeze. Stay right there.

02:51.705 --> 02:55.809
-No! No! Mom!
-On the ground.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.145
What choice
did you give us, Rebecca?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.680
(echoing):
I'm sorry we had to do this,

02:59.713 --> 03:02.750
but you nearly killed
your teacher.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.355
(panting)

03:07.388 --> 03:09.690
(crying)

03:19.767 --> 03:22.736
(Twist screaming)

03:25.205 --> 03:29.577
Help. Help!
Help, somebody, please.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.579
Please help.

03:31.612 --> 03:33.414
What are you doing to her?

03:33.447 --> 03:36.083
We're doing what we have to
to keep her restrained.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.919
She's just upset.

03:38.952 --> 03:42.189
Upset? You're keeping her
in a windowless box.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.724
She's strapped
in that spinning thing.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.226
She has to be in darkness,
in constant motion,

03:46.260 --> 03:48.529
so she can't just
twist her way out.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.398
She helped us, you know.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.401
She doesn't deserve this at all.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.536
-And she's not crazy, she's...
-Andy, I'm sorry.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.205
TWIST:
Help!

03:58.238 --> 04:00.308
Reeva said we can't risk
having her escape again.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.211
(footfalls approaching)

04:04.244 --> 04:06.046
ESME: I know you've been
preoccupied with Rebecca,

04:06.079 --> 04:08.749
but we need to figure out
what we're gonna do.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.618
The information we got
at the bank?

04:10.651 --> 04:12.553
If we don't move on it soon,
it'll be too late.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.221
REEVA:
I am well aware.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.889
The plan has not changed.

04:15.923 --> 04:19.560
But the plan depends on Andrew.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.562
We need his help
to get us into the target.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.398
He's not in a helping mood.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.233
(exhales)

04:26.266 --> 04:28.336
Keep moving forward
with the preparations.

04:29.770 --> 04:33.641
I will talk to Andrew.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.749
(footfalls approach)

04:41.782 --> 04:45.419
-You all set to go?
-Yeah. Ready.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.921
I know it's been a long day.
It'll be worth it, I promise.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.657
Course it will.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.158
I'm just gonna lock up,
and then we'll head out.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.160
Hey.

04:53.193 --> 04:54.795
CAITLIN:
Ready?

04:54.828 --> 04:57.164
-I need to talk to you guys.
-What's up?

04:57.197 --> 04:58.932
It's about Madeline's research.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.134
Noah told me
that she's not just trying

05:01.168 --> 05:04.271
to find a cure
to suppress the X-Gene in you.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.607
She's trying to find one
that'll suppress it in everyone,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.008
whether they like it or not.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.610
-(scoffs)
-Well, that's...

05:09.643 --> 05:11.311
that's not possible.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.946
If Madeline had
a problem with mutants,

05:12.980 --> 05:14.782
she would have called
the police on us already.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.184
-You must have misunderstood.
-I didn't misunderstand.

05:17.217 --> 05:20.320
We have to stop her.
Tomorrow I'm gonna talk to Noah,

05:20.354 --> 05:21.789
figure out where they're taking
our blood samples.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.190
Wait, wait, you heard Madeline

05:23.223 --> 05:25.459
talk about wanting peace,

05:25.493 --> 05:27.861
h-how upset she was about what's
going on between the mutants

05:27.895 --> 05:29.296
and the Purifiers.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.732
Her brother helped found
the Purifiers.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.167
(chuckles):
Wait.

05:34.201 --> 05:37.004
Madeline's whole life
is helping people.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.372
That's not what this brother
is doing.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.673
She disagrees with him,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.709
only because she's trying
to eliminate hate

05:41.742 --> 05:44.478
by eliminating mutants.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.481
(exhales)

05:47.515 --> 05:51.819
Your father,
he, he needs this cure.

05:51.852 --> 05:54.822
I know. But if she finds it,

05:54.855 --> 05:56.890
how long before parents use it
on their kids?

05:56.924 --> 06:00.661
Before the government uses it
on everyone, just in case?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.496
We'll make her keep
the research confidential.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.164
She thinks
she's saving the world.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.667
She already has our DNA.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.368
We can't let her use it.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.540
Lauren is right.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.676
We have to find a way
to destroy the research and go.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.745
-No, wait, without the cure?
-(door closes)

06:17.778 --> 06:20.714
We can't risk the lives
of every mutant on Earth

06:20.748 --> 06:22.716
-just for my sake.
-MADELINE: Everybody ready?

06:22.750 --> 06:25.886
Great. Here we go.

06:27.755 --> 06:30.390
(siren wailing)

06:35.095 --> 06:36.597
(door opens)

06:40.100 --> 06:43.270
Hey. How you holding up?

06:43.303 --> 06:46.239
I've, uh, I have been better.

06:46.273 --> 06:48.909
(phone clicks)

06:48.942 --> 06:51.545
(exhales)

06:51.579 --> 06:55.215
Brother, I know you're having
a hard time right now,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.050
but we need to move.

06:57.084 --> 07:01.054
Ah, John, I just, uh, I just
said goodbye to my daughter...

07:01.088 --> 07:02.422
Just listen to me, okay?

07:02.456 --> 07:04.424
When the Inner Circle hit
that bank,

07:04.458 --> 07:07.728
they were after a company
called Regimen Technologies.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.732
Now, if we can figure out why,
then we can fight them.

07:11.765 --> 07:16.236
You know, Lorna, she sent our
baby away for the Inner Circle.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.238
Our child, John.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.608
How do you fight that?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.784
THUNDERBIRD:
What choice do we have?

07:30.818 --> 07:34.488
I mean, every move they make,
the country gets more divided.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.591
Our human allies,
they're afraid to help us.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.628
Mutants are deciding
the only option is war.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.429
If we don't turn this thing
around now,

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
it's gonna be too late.

07:46.366 --> 07:51.304
I don't ask a lot of you,
but I need you with me.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.775
It's for Dawn.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.977
For the world
she's gonna live in.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.621
Okay.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.957
But you have to promise me
one thing.

08:09.990 --> 08:15.796
If this leads us to Reeva Payge,
I get to take the first shot.

08:15.829 --> 08:19.032
-(pats shoulder)
-Done.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.839
WILSON:
Now, I know you're all here

08:25.873 --> 08:29.643
to see your favorite commentator
from The Ryan Hour,

08:29.677 --> 08:31.211
but I want
to make something clear.

08:31.244 --> 08:34.982
This man is taking our message
to the nation.

08:35.015 --> 08:39.486
People around this world are
finally starting to wake up.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.321
That's why we're here!

08:41.354 --> 08:44.191
That's why he's here,
Jace Turner.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.693
(cheering, applause)

08:55.035 --> 08:58.672
I want to talk about this
so-called Mutant Uprising.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.208
We need to start calling it
exactly what it is.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.677
It's straight-up terrorism.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.346
37 humans slaughtered
at that bank.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.181
It's up to us
to do something about it.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.349
And I'm not talking
about some day.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.551
I'm talking about now.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.520
I'm talking about today.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.623
Yeah, that's right, right now.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.392
Now, the first thing we're
asking you to do is simple:

09:19.426 --> 09:21.028
watch and report.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.864
We got a hotline number.
Put it in your phones.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.198
Leaders have schedules
and assignments

09:25.232 --> 09:27.034
for roving street patrols.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.036
And while you're out there,
if you see any evidence

09:29.069 --> 09:31.038
of a mutant threat--
and I'm talking about anything--

09:31.071 --> 09:34.041
call it in, call it in
right away because it is time

09:34.074 --> 09:36.443
to take our safety
into our own hands.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.379
'Cause guess what.
The cops, the Sentinel Services,

09:39.412 --> 09:40.580
they're not getting it done.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.215
So this is what we're gonna do.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.718
We are gonna start
a citizen militia.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.754
We're gonna put eyes and ears

09:46.787 --> 09:49.056
in every single neighborhood,
and we are gonna stop

09:49.089 --> 09:51.424
mutant violence
before it spreads.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.795
This Mutant Uprising,

09:54.828 --> 09:57.064
they picked the wrong species
to tangle with.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.398
They don't know it yet.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.801
But I swear to God,
they're about to find out.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.836
(cheering, applause)

10:08.341 --> 10:09.743
Yes?

10:09.777 --> 10:11.745
We've been monitoring Rebecca.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.414
She's not tolerating
confinement well.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.916
Just keep her alive.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.284
-She...
-Help!

10:17.317 --> 10:20.153
-Help, help, please!
-She won't stop screaming.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.755
And?

10:21.789 --> 10:23.423
TWIST:
Please help.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.792
Let her scream.

10:24.825 --> 10:26.426
TWIST:
Help, somebody, please.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.796
It's a shame.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.164
With her power, she could have
done so much more.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.433
TWIST:
Make it stop, please!

10:33.466 --> 10:35.635
Don't worry.
She still has a part to play.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.137
TWIST:
Stop!

10:37.170 --> 10:39.639
Please, I didn't do anything!
I just...

10:44.812 --> 10:46.446
(exhales)

10:46.479 --> 10:48.716
(knocking on door)

10:49.983 --> 10:53.620
Hey. Uh, you all right?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.790
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just putting some things away.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.459
(sniffles)

10:59.492 --> 11:00.994
Um, do you have a second?

11:02.529 --> 11:05.132
Yeah. What's up?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.334
Hey, do you think
it was worth it?

11:08.335 --> 11:10.503
Worth what?

11:10.537 --> 11:12.840
(sighs) I don't know.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.709
All the stuff
that happened with Rebecca.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.178
I've just been thinking.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.649
You sent Dawn
to live somewhere else.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.385
I mean, I mean,
that's-that's your daughter.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.988
Do you really think that all,
all this--

11:28.021 --> 11:29.857
everything we're doing--
was worth that?

11:29.890 --> 11:33.493
-Don't you miss her?
-(exhales)

11:33.526 --> 11:35.362
So hard it hurts.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.334
What I'm doing is for her. Okay?

11:41.368 --> 11:44.171
Everything that's happening now
is necessary

11:44.204 --> 11:48.508
for the world to be
what it could be.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.344
When it's done,
I will be with Dawn.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.181
But what if the mutant homeland
never happens?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.582
Andy, it's going to happen.

11:55.615 --> 11:57.584
Hey.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.587
Because we are going
to make it happen.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.455
Yeah.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.960
I'll see you out there.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.596
THUNDERBIRD:
Did some research

12:09.629 --> 12:10.864
on Regimen Technologies.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.365
There's almost nothing
out there,

12:12.399 --> 12:14.067
but I found this one guy
in the D.C. area--

12:14.101 --> 12:15.602
some executive-- and he spoke

12:15.635 --> 12:17.537
at a security conference
a few years back.

12:17.570 --> 12:20.407
He lives across the street.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.442
BLINK:
Laurence Hayes.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.611
So, uh, you want to wait
for him by his car?

12:24.644 --> 12:26.413
See if he'll talk to us all
about his secret job.

12:26.446 --> 12:29.582
No. We're gonna grab him in the
lobby when he leaves for work.

12:30.818 --> 12:32.285
We'll get him out quietly.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.386
-(scoffs)
-Take him somewhere.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.788
Get some answers.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.957
Right. "Get some answers."

12:36.990 --> 12:38.792
Said no good guy ever.

12:38.826 --> 12:41.228
We're not seriously gonna
kidnap a systems analyst

12:41.261 --> 12:42.662
on his way to work.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.303
Wow. We are really living
the dream of the X-Men.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.439
-Clarice...
-This is crazy.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.908
This guy isn't a saint.
He's with a company that does

12:54.942 --> 12:56.910
mutant-related security research
for the government.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.412
And we can't just take him
because of that.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.447
Look, guys, we're here.

13:02.182 --> 13:04.117
Let's just get it done.

13:14.627 --> 13:15.963
Thank you.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.764
That looks delicious.

13:17.797 --> 13:20.000
I was thinking Lauren might want
to have another look

13:20.033 --> 13:21.601
around the campus today, uh,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.103
while we're working
on your treatments.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.272
There's lots to see.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.307
Actually,
I'd rather go to the lab.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.009
Noah says you need more samples.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.310
Yes, but no rush.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.312
We can work
with the first batch.

13:32.345 --> 13:35.983
No, I-I want to.
It's important.

13:38.185 --> 13:41.488
Yeah, I-I-I think we're all
just anxious to get started.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.624
It feels like we might be on
to something significant.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.792
I'm sure of it.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.694
I have to believe
that it's no accident

13:47.727 --> 13:50.463
that I crossed paths
with your family again.

13:50.497 --> 13:54.034
We can finally finish the work
your father started.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.668
We're gonna change the world.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.641
MAN (over radio): Yeah,
but you're missing the point.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.842
The point is,
this guy's gonna come in

14:02.876 --> 14:06.013
and change the whole
passing scheme... (stammers)

14:06.046 --> 14:07.047
WOMAN (over radio):
Well, it doesn't matter.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.148
They weren't playing
as a team anyway.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.382
(stations change)

14:09.416 --> 14:10.850
ANNOUNCER:
On tonight's Ryan Hour,

14:10.884 --> 14:12.685
-featuring crisis responders...
-Where are they?

14:12.719 --> 14:15.055
...who have organized
their own citizen mili...

14:15.088 --> 14:16.723
-* Now...
-Ugh.

14:16.756 --> 14:20.160
-(music stops)
-(phone vibrates)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.828
Clarice, what's going on?
I've been...

14:21.861 --> 14:23.196
-BLINK: Things went sideways!
-(gunshots over phone)

14:23.230 --> 14:24.831
-No time to explain.
-Are those gunshots?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.333
-What the hell's going on?
-Just open the trunk.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.767
-Open the damn trunk!
-All right. All right.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.904
You got to be kidding me.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.541
(gasps)

14:37.044 --> 14:39.346
Don't look at me, man.
I don't know any more than you.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.580
No!

14:40.613 --> 14:42.349
What happened
to pulling him out quietly?!

14:42.382 --> 14:44.851
-We had to improvise.
-And that's why we got shot at.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.586
There were security guards,
and you still wanted to go

14:46.619 --> 14:48.188
-through with it.
-We got to go, come on.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.389
-HAYES (muffled): Get me out!
-Hold that thought.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.191
Come on, get me out of here!

14:51.224 --> 14:52.759
(muffled shouting)

14:52.792 --> 14:54.627
(indistinct chatter)

14:55.728 --> 14:58.031
I managed to get
some of the medication.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.599
You think it's gonna be enough?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.201
CAITLIN:
I hope so.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.036
It was all I could get
without anyone noticing.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.037
Here she comes.

15:04.071 --> 15:05.538
I've adjusted the dose a little,

15:05.572 --> 15:08.208
now that we have a better sense
of how your system's

15:08.241 --> 15:10.243
-responding to it.
-So, what you said yesterday,

15:10.277 --> 15:12.612
about this being
a temporary fix...

15:12.645 --> 15:14.747
-how long should it last?
-It's hard to say.

15:14.781 --> 15:17.084
But if the treatment

15:17.117 --> 15:19.119
is blocking what my X-Gene does,

15:19.152 --> 15:20.887
why won't it last forever?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.156
-Maybe it's easier
if I show you.
-Oh.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.426
(quietly):
I feel horrible.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.928
She's trying to save my life,
and here we are planning...

15:28.962 --> 15:30.563
We're doing what we have to do.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.732
Reed, this is
our last chance to learn

15:32.765 --> 15:34.767
what we can
about your condition.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.242
Reed's X-Gene manufactures
complex proteins

15:42.275 --> 15:45.445
that release energy.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.747
The medicine that Otto and I
made blocks the proteins,

15:47.780 --> 15:49.749
interrupting the system.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.251
But when it ceases
to be effective,

15:51.284 --> 15:55.422
the result is a massive
release of power...

15:55.455 --> 15:57.757
and terrible damage.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.593
That's why the work we're doing
with Lauren is so important.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.463
By comparing your X-Gene
and hers,

16:03.496 --> 16:05.798
we can learn
to not just block the gene

16:05.832 --> 16:08.868
but turn it off entirely.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.777
I know it's hard, Reed.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.679
I remember how I felt,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.281
sitting at your bedside.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.283
You were a sick little boy

16:23.316 --> 16:25.552
who just wanted to get better.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.789
I let you down
all those years ago.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.492
I won't let you down again.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.365
Hey, uh, sorry if
I freaked you out yesterday,

16:38.398 --> 16:41.201
talking about your blood
saving millions of people.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.469
Don't worry about it.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.304
It's just a lot
to wrap my head around.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.472
NOAH:
I just get excited.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.973
You know,
we've been working so hard.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.375
I really think this could be
the breakthrough

16:48.408 --> 16:49.409
we've been waiting for.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.345
So...

16:52.379 --> 16:55.315
you must have, like, a gallon
of my blood by now, right?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.050
Where do you keep it all?

16:57.084 --> 16:59.319
Keep it? Just, uh, cold storage.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.987
Can I see it?

17:01.020 --> 17:03.823
Uh, it's just a bunch
of refrigerators.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.325
Seriously,
it's nothing to look at.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.161
Come on. I really want to see
the whole process.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.362
It's important to me.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.999
They really, uh,
can't have visitors.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.667
Samples could get contaminated.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.836
Don't I get special privileges?

17:16.869 --> 17:20.373
For, you know,
helping millions of people?

17:22.409 --> 17:24.244
I guess that's fair...

17:24.277 --> 17:26.246
if I get the privilege
of taking you to lunch.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.348
-Lunch?
-Yeah.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.250
Or a second breakfast
if you prefer. (chuckles)

17:30.283 --> 17:33.019
(clears throat)
Yeah.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.421
You just gave blood.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.689
Now you need a meal
to regain your strength.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.058
Okay. Let's do it.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.560
(chuckles softly)

17:49.302 --> 17:50.403
(grunts)

17:50.437 --> 17:51.871
BLINK:
John, can I talk to you?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.740
THUNDERBIRD:
What's going on?

17:53.773 --> 17:55.442
Checked the police scanner.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.877
Cops are searching for two
mutants suspected of kidnapping

17:57.910 --> 17:59.379
with orders to shoot on sight.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.548
-They have our description?
-Yes, they do.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.716
Hooded male,
five-ten to six feet.

18:03.750 --> 18:07.053
Petite female with the power
to "create purple hoops."

18:07.086 --> 18:10.323
You know, I always thought
they were a bit more lavender.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.394
(grunts)

18:14.427 --> 18:17.297
You got some serious balls
cracking wise right now.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.565
What's the problem here?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.100
They don't know anything.
We're in the clear.

18:21.134 --> 18:22.402
The problem is, because of us,

18:22.435 --> 18:24.137
we set off
this huge mutant hunt.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.938
The Sentinel Services, the cops,

18:25.972 --> 18:27.274
they're kicking in doors,
they're...

18:27.307 --> 18:28.741
No. Hey, hey, hey.
All anyone knows,

18:28.775 --> 18:31.644
right now, is some guy in a head
bag was taken by some mutants.

18:31.678 --> 18:34.247
Okay, once they figure out
that guy is from Regimen,

18:34.281 --> 18:36.416
everything changes.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.251
I got to get answers from him
before then.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.786
John, what is wrong with you?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.121
Oh, my God.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.657
You know, you give Marcos
a few hours

18:44.691 --> 18:46.326
to deal with the loss of his kid

18:46.359 --> 18:49.929
before dragging him
into all of this.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.598
And then you're springing
the kidnapping on us.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.266
-I told you the plan.
-Yeah, but the plan didn't

18:53.300 --> 18:54.967
include a head bag
and flying bullets.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.670
Look, I...

18:57.704 --> 19:00.673
I get that you hate
the Inner Circle right now.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.675
No, this has nothing to do
with my feelings.

19:02.709 --> 19:05.945
All right? Or Marcos or you.

19:05.978 --> 19:08.281
This fight is bigger
than all of us.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.516
It's happening now.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.188
HAYES: Look, you guys are making
a big mistake, okay?

19:15.222 --> 19:18.291
W-We're just a boring
tech company.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.026
We-we-we manufacture
components to help,

19:20.059 --> 19:23.496
uh, household appliances
become more efficient.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.966
-Smart refrigerators,
copy machines.
-No. No.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.635
That's a lot of security
for a "boring tech company."

19:28.668 --> 19:30.970
Come on, man.
You know the Mutant Uprising?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.806
They're that group
that hit the mental hospital

19:33.840 --> 19:35.808
and they killed all those people
at Creed Financial?

19:35.842 --> 19:39.546
Their next target isn't a
warehouse full of coffee makers.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.381
It's your company.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.516
-Wait, what?
-THUNDERBIRD: Hey.

19:43.550 --> 19:47.153
We're just trying to make sure
no one gets hurt.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.055
All right? But we need you

19:49.088 --> 19:51.157
to tell us why Regimen
is being targeted.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.159
I don't, I don't know. Okay?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.527
Since when do a bunch
of angry mutants

19:54.561 --> 19:57.163
need a reason to attack
something? I have no idea.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.197
(yells)

19:59.232 --> 20:00.667
No more lies!

20:00.700 --> 20:01.734
(gasps)

20:01.768 --> 20:04.103
Or I'll show you
what an angry mutant looks like.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.173
Okay. Okay.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.177
Look, th-there might be
something.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.180
We don't publicize it for
security reasons, but Regimen...

20:14.213 --> 20:17.250
runs the control systems
for the...

20:17.284 --> 20:19.786
for the mutant
restraint collars.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.955
Wait.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.793
You control the collars
in the prisons?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.529
Which prisons?

20:29.562 --> 20:32.198
(scoffs)

20:32.231 --> 20:33.700
All of them.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.603
(scoffs)

20:42.409 --> 20:43.543
RYAN: I know
the citizen militia movement

20:43.576 --> 20:44.777
has been accused of bigotry.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.046
People use words
like "hate group,"

20:47.079 --> 20:49.449
claim you exclude mutants.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.718
No. We're about patriotism.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.420
We're about law and order.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.388
I mean, are we proud
of our species? Yes.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.890
But if there are mutants
who want to do the right thing

20:57.924 --> 20:59.058
and support the laws
of this country,

20:59.091 --> 21:00.393
then they're more than welcome
to join us.

21:00.427 --> 21:01.394
(Frost sisters groan)

21:01.428 --> 21:04.397
Talk about failing upward.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.766
You should've killed Agent
Turner when you had the chance.

21:06.799 --> 21:08.401
Wouldn't have been that hard.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.069
ESME: Oh, I'm sorry,
I was a little busy

21:10.102 --> 21:11.604
saving the two of you.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.806
REEVA:
Don't bicker, girls.

21:13.840 --> 21:19.078
This "citizen militia movement"
just means we're doing our job.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.914
People need to know
where the battle lines are...

21:21.948 --> 21:23.082
and this is exactly
the kind of thing

21:23.115 --> 21:24.917
that makes 'em nice and clear.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.953
Reeva, you need to see this.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.621
Ten minutes ago, someone used

21:28.655 --> 21:31.257
a remote log-on to review the
security protocols at Regimen.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.492
REEVA:
I thought you said you could

21:32.525 --> 21:33.660
penetrate the system
without being detected.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.094
SAGE:
I did, but someone's looking.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.329
And if they look hard enough,

21:36.363 --> 21:37.464
they'll find out
what we're up to.

21:37.497 --> 21:40.633
They're in D.C.
I'm trying to pinpoint a...

21:40.667 --> 21:42.435
I need you to do more than try.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.671
Get the location,
send Fade to handle it.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.707
Whoever this is knows too much
already. I want them gone.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.286
I don't like this.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.121
We should've heard
from Lauren by now.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.123
She's getting into the lab
with Noah.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.492
We-we have to give her time.

22:05.525 --> 22:08.528
MADELINE:
Reed, Caitlin.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.296
Uh, something's come up
we need to discuss.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.798
And let me start by saying,

22:11.831 --> 22:15.301
I know you haven't been
entirely honest with me.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.170
I don't know what you mean.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.206
I've just been looking
at Lauren's samples.

22:21.741 --> 22:23.743
We need to talk
about her brother Andrew.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.682
Look, I know a bit about
what happened in Atlanta,

22:29.716 --> 22:31.217
and I've respected your privacy,

22:31.250 --> 22:34.721
but now... I think he's
too important to ignore.

22:34.754 --> 22:37.990
Lauren's DNA carries
two versions of the X-Gene.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.727
Two? H-How is that possible?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.729
I'm not sure.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.031
Otto theorized that
your grandfather Andreas

22:45.064 --> 22:47.166
and his sister shared
two X-Genes.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.001
They reinforced each other,

22:49.035 --> 22:51.237
got stronger when they
used their power together.

22:51.270 --> 22:52.705
They were drawn
to each other somehow.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.907
Is this something
you've noticed?

22:54.941 --> 22:57.844
-Uh...
-Andy, um...

22:57.877 --> 22:59.446
he hasn't been living with us.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.016
Oh, that's too bad.

23:04.050 --> 23:05.685
If he could be part
of the study,

23:05.718 --> 23:07.854
it would be such a major help.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.222
That won't be possible.

23:10.256 --> 23:12.525
We haven't seen our son
in months.

23:12.559 --> 23:16.395
Oh... I'm so sorry.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.872
All right.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.441
Prepare to be disappointed.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.712
I don't know,
looks pretty cool to me.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.046
(Noah chuckles)

23:34.080 --> 23:37.083
So all of this
is Madeline's research?

23:37.116 --> 23:40.720
Pretty much.
This is years of work in here.

23:40.753 --> 23:44.991
Everything leading up to, uh...
Well, I guess, to finding you.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.294
(beeping)

23:48.327 --> 23:49.796
So many locks. (chuckles)

23:49.829 --> 23:51.430
What, are you afraid
of vampires?

23:51.464 --> 23:54.601
You were so freaked out
about taking me down here.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.436
You have to understand,
this place means a lot to me.

23:57.470 --> 24:01.941
Before I came here,
my own family was afraid of me.

24:01.974 --> 24:05.578
Madeline was the first person
to make me feel like...

24:05.612 --> 24:06.746
like I belonged.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.916
She changed my life, and, uh,

24:09.949 --> 24:11.918
now we're gonna
change the world.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.788
This research, though...

24:15.822 --> 24:17.657
do you really want
to create something

24:17.690 --> 24:19.626
that could eliminate
the X-Gene forever?

24:22.629 --> 24:24.597
I wear this every day of my life

24:24.631 --> 24:26.999
so I don't hurt people
with my so-called ability.

24:27.033 --> 24:30.837
I just want to be normal.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.471
What's wrong with that?

24:34.473 --> 24:36.042
Nothing.

24:38.711 --> 24:41.113
Sorry.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.281
What about that lunch?

24:42.314 --> 24:43.315
(chuckles)
Yeah.

24:45.718 --> 24:46.719
(sighs)

24:48.555 --> 24:52.158
Better hurry.
Got to get that table.

25:00.733 --> 25:03.002
Come on!
What are you doing here?

25:03.035 --> 25:04.503
We know there's
gonna be an attack,

25:04.537 --> 25:05.805
we just need to know where.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.507
There are literally
dozens of facilities

25:08.541 --> 25:09.976
that use mutant
restraint collars.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.678
I don't want any more excuses
from you.

25:11.711 --> 25:12.712
Hurry up.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.148
ECLIPSE:
Okay, brother,

25:16.182 --> 25:18.551
you need to check yourself
before you blow a gasket.

25:18.585 --> 25:21.053
You of all people are gonna
lecture me on keeping my cool?

25:21.087 --> 25:24.490
Yeah. I know. Shouldn't that
tell you something?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
Flying off the handle,
dragging Clarice

25:26.559 --> 25:28.160
into a firefight
that you didn't tell her?

25:28.194 --> 25:31.063
This might be our last chance
to stop the Inner Circle, okay?

25:31.097 --> 25:33.700
I'm not gonna let this slip
through our fingers.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.706
-We're right
in the middle of this.
-Tough.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.708
You know that manhunt
that you blew off earlier?

25:41.741 --> 25:44.076
Now the cops are looking
in a six-block radius

25:44.110 --> 25:46.178
for us, arresting mutants.

25:46.212 --> 25:49.048
-Arresting them for what?
-For having the X-Gene.

25:49.081 --> 25:53.686
People are getting busted
because of what we did.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.188
-And we're supposed
to be saving them?
-That's what I'm trying to do.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.390
All right, if we don't hit
the Inner Circle right now,

25:58.424 --> 26:00.693
-the Underground-- it's over.
-Yeah, I get it,

26:00.727 --> 26:03.195
but there are people
who need its help right now.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.363
Since when are you so concerned

26:04.396 --> 26:05.765
about the mission
of the Underground anyway?

26:05.798 --> 26:06.933
And what's that
supposed to mean?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.203
Oh, is this about
the Morlocks and Erg?

26:11.237 --> 26:12.705
Well, you admitted
you went behind my back,

26:12.739 --> 26:13.873
you gave him information.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.274
And whatever else
happened down there.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.409
Come on, you really think
I'm cheating on you?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.616
I don't know
what I think anymore.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.918
Wow.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.623
Why don't you go enjoy

26:30.657 --> 26:32.725
your lonely noble crusade,

26:32.759 --> 26:35.762
while I fix the mess
that you made?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.635
(knocking on door)

26:43.770 --> 26:44.937
Andrew.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.640
Can I come in?

26:47.674 --> 26:51.277
I know you're upset
about Rebecca,

26:51.310 --> 26:53.612
but for our next operation
we need your help.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.481
So I'm just supposed to do
all this fighting

26:55.514 --> 26:56.949
while she's trapped
in that thing downstairs?

26:56.983 --> 26:58.284
What happened at the bank was...

26:58.317 --> 27:00.452
It was her first mission.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.089
-It was a mistake.
-A mistake that put

27:03.122 --> 27:04.423
all of us in danger.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.591
Everyone she ever loved
turned on her.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.759
She spent the last year

27:06.793 --> 27:08.427
in a dark room
getting drugged and tortured.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.662
I don't know what you expected.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.100
You're right.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.302
Rebecca is a victim.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.304
What she did was not her fault.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.107
It was theirs.

27:21.140 --> 27:24.143
The humans who took her freedom
and turned her into what she is.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.611
So why are we keeping her
in a cage?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.613
We're doing the same thing
that they did.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.148
Because it'd be better to what?

27:29.181 --> 27:32.051
Turn her loose?
With what she knows?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.455
I'm sorry, Andrew.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.992
Look, I know that this
is difficult for you.

27:40.026 --> 27:43.162
I forget just how young
you really are.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.333
I'm old enough, Reeva.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.137
Then you understand.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.538
We are trying to make a world

27:52.571 --> 27:55.207
where she can get
the care that she needs,

27:55.241 --> 27:56.843
and our next mission
is a very important step

27:56.876 --> 27:58.677
towards that world.

27:58.711 --> 28:02.214
Someday you will see that this
was the only way to help her.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.255
I know you'll do
the right thing.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.358
(door closes)

28:36.582 --> 28:38.717
(elevator bell dings)

28:38.751 --> 28:40.753
(Twist screaming)

28:55.234 --> 28:56.903
(Twist coughing)

28:57.904 --> 28:58.905
Rebecca!

29:00.907 --> 29:01.908
Give me your hand.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.948
You okay?

29:08.981 --> 29:11.217
-You came for me.
-Yeah.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.419
Of course I did.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.735
Want to get out of here?

29:29.768 --> 29:31.770
(chuckles)

29:34.941 --> 29:37.576
-Where are we going?
-We don't have much time.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.478
They're having a meeting
about the mission upstairs.

29:39.511 --> 29:40.980
We have to run
before they finish.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.816
Do we? I got a better idea.

29:43.850 --> 29:45.417
-What are you doing?
-Going up.

29:45.451 --> 29:46.919
I already told you,
everyone's up there.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.454
Exactly. They'll all be
in one place.

29:48.487 --> 29:49.655
No, y-you don't understand.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.490
Reeva hates you
for what you did at the bank.

29:51.523 --> 29:52.825
I tried to tell her
that you lost control

29:52.859 --> 29:54.760
-and you didn't mean to...
-Didn't mean to?

29:54.793 --> 29:56.495
Of course I meant to.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.764
And as for Reeva, she made it
pretty clear she hated me

29:58.797 --> 30:00.799
when she changed my address
to hellhole.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.669
We will be approaching
from this direction.

30:03.702 --> 30:06.605
Once everyone is in position,
then we move in.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.841
Please, Rebecca,
we-we can just run.

30:08.875 --> 30:10.943
-We can run away.
-Andy.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.778
Reeva already
tracked me down once.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.613
She'll just do it again.

30:14.646 --> 30:18.117
We have to take care of her
before we go.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.986
We have to take care
of all of them.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.355
Like I did at the bank.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.959
-No, Rebecca, w-wait.
-Andy.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.795
Stay back,
or I'll make you stay back.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.866
-You can't do this.
-I have to, for both of us.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.567
(elevator bell dings)

30:42.041 --> 30:45.011
No! Rebecca! Don't!

30:45.044 --> 30:46.545
(screaming)

31:01.393 --> 31:03.362
Hey, hey.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.397
Rebecca.

31:05.431 --> 31:09.668
She's not breathing!
Somebody help!

31:09.701 --> 31:12.671
We need to get a doctor.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.373
Rebecca!

31:14.406 --> 31:16.108
-Andrew, Andrew.
-Rebecca.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.378
-She's gone.
-No.

31:19.411 --> 31:22.915
Rebecca!

31:22.949 --> 31:24.683
No, she-she can't be. I...

31:24.716 --> 31:27.086
She can't be. I-I didn't,
I didn't mean to.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.520
I-I know.

31:28.554 --> 31:32.458
Andy, you saved us.

31:34.760 --> 31:39.065
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.267
I'm sorry.

31:44.436 --> 31:45.871
What do you mean Clarice left?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.773
You're the one that said you
weren't sure she was with us.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.775
-You were right.
-I told you that so that you

31:49.808 --> 31:51.243
could keep her here,
not-not drive her away.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.711
Marcos, what do you
want me to do?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.380
All right, if she doesn't want
to be a part of this fight...

31:54.413 --> 31:55.714
Who do you think
we're fighting for,

31:55.747 --> 31:58.117
John, you ever think about that?

31:58.150 --> 31:59.718
Um...

31:59.751 --> 32:01.387
If you bring up
the X-Men right now,

32:01.420 --> 32:03.722
so help me God,
I will punch you in the mouth.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.925
-(scoffs)
-Look, John,

32:06.959 --> 32:08.560
the point of all of this

32:08.594 --> 32:11.830
is-is not to be able to fight
in some big mutant war.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.900
This is for the people we love.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.604
HAYES:
Oh, I-I-I got something.

32:19.771 --> 32:22.241
-What?
-Strange, I've been,

32:22.274 --> 32:24.310
uh, checking the log-ins
at the prisons

32:24.343 --> 32:26.145
and the detention centers--
nothing there--

32:26.178 --> 32:28.014
-but on the technical...
-Quiet.

32:30.149 --> 32:32.818
Someone's here.

32:33.852 --> 32:35.321
Who?

32:35.354 --> 32:36.455
(heavy breathing)

32:38.790 --> 32:40.826
(gunshots)

32:43.629 --> 32:44.663
Fade!

32:47.199 --> 32:48.467
(grunts)

32:50.036 --> 32:51.837
ECLIPSE:
Where'd he go?

32:53.839 --> 32:55.607
Where the hell is he?

32:55.641 --> 32:58.144
-He's got to still be here.
-Quiet, quiet.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.384
(grunts)

33:06.385 --> 33:08.320
I was just here for him.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.988
(panting)

33:10.022 --> 33:12.158
We have no beef with you.

33:12.191 --> 33:14.026
Yeah, the hell you don't.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.663
(grunting)

33:18.830 --> 33:20.466
(Fade growls)

33:20.499 --> 33:22.668
(both grunting)

33:27.339 --> 33:29.308
(siren wailing in distance)

33:29.341 --> 33:31.510
Cops are coming; we got to move.

33:31.543 --> 33:32.678
Yeah.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.886
No, I want more eyes
on the Red Line metro.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.721
Find out who we have in the
northwest part of the city.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.823
We got something. Some kind of
mutant fight near 11th Street.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.692
Someone heard gunshots,
saw laser beams.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.760
That's where that clinic is.
The one that we hit.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.363
Tell our people in the area
to stay sharp.

33:51.397 --> 33:52.864
Let's get over there.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.040
(knock on door)

34:02.074 --> 34:03.075
(Andy crying)

34:03.109 --> 34:04.210
POLARIS:
You want to talk?

34:04.243 --> 34:05.744
ANDY:
Not really.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.727
(Polaris sighs)

34:28.600 --> 34:30.869
Why did she make me do that?

34:30.902 --> 34:35.274
Andy, I've spent time in places
like the mental hospital

34:35.307 --> 34:37.709
where they kept Rebecca.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.278
Uh, you got to understand,

34:39.311 --> 34:41.913
if, if you're not broken
going in,

34:41.947 --> 34:43.081
you definitely are coming out.

34:44.950 --> 34:47.253
And they made her who she was.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.787
(voice breaking):
And now she's gone.

34:48.820 --> 34:51.056
Yeah, but this mission
is a way to...

34:51.089 --> 34:53.259
I don't care
about the mission, okay?

34:56.828 --> 34:58.897
Look, I didn't want to go either

34:58.930 --> 35:01.066
until I found out
about the target.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.801
You know the mutant
restraint collars?

35:02.834 --> 35:05.137
Yeah, I wore one in prison,

35:05.171 --> 35:07.273
they-they tortured you
and Lauren with them.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.641
-Yeah, I remember.
-That's who we're going after.

35:09.675 --> 35:12.311
The company behind them.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.580
Like a factory?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.748
Won't they just make more?

35:16.782 --> 35:18.417
Not a factory.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.920
The D.C. facility
where they control the collars.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.455
Control which collars?

35:23.489 --> 35:25.424
All of them. Okay?

35:25.457 --> 35:28.126
Every mutant in this country

35:28.160 --> 35:31.530
that's being tortured
and abused.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.600
(sighs)

35:34.633 --> 35:37.135
Every mutant like Rebecca.

35:38.504 --> 35:41.607
Andy, this mission--
this is your chance

35:41.640 --> 35:44.376
to get justice
for what they did to her.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.948
When do we leave?

35:49.981 --> 35:51.950
REEVA:
Using the information

35:51.983 --> 35:54.686
we got from the bank,
Sage pinpointed the location

35:54.720 --> 35:57.623
of the Regimen server farm
and penetrated its security.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.124
Their anti-mutant
defense arrays

35:59.157 --> 36:00.892
will be down
by the time we arrive.

36:11.503 --> 36:12.638
(man screams over comm)

36:12.671 --> 36:13.805
ESME:
We're in.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.342
-No problems?
-None at all.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.547
* When I think of you

36:24.516 --> 36:25.684
* When I

36:25.717 --> 36:29.688
* When I think of you

36:29.721 --> 36:32.491
* When I...

36:32.524 --> 36:35.060
That's... new.

36:35.093 --> 36:36.495
Just a little something I made

36:36.528 --> 36:40.198
to remind me where I come from,

36:40.232 --> 36:43.369
and I brought
my steel-toed boots, too.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.517
This is for her, Andrew.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.751
* When I

37:02.388 --> 37:03.789
* When I

37:05.557 --> 37:07.225
* When I

37:08.794 --> 37:10.061
* Oh...

37:17.068 --> 37:18.737
(screaming)

37:18.770 --> 37:20.706
Our blood's in there.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.541
And Madeline's research,

37:22.574 --> 37:24.476
it's all of it.

37:26.778 --> 37:29.815
We need to destroy everything,
to be safe.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.785
-There's no other way.
-We have to move quickly.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.221
As soon as the alarm goes off,
we're gonna have a short time

37:36.254 --> 37:37.423
to get out of here.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.400
-(door opens)
-NOAH: Lauren, don't.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.636
Hands down. Now!

37:50.669 --> 37:51.737
Stay where you are.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.271
You heard him.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.673
Hands down.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.346
Reed.

38:01.647 --> 38:03.114
I was trying to save your life.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.184
Why would you do this?

38:15.461 --> 38:17.763
I knew that something was wrong
when I found out that Noah

38:17.796 --> 38:20.432
had let Lauren come in here,
but this?

38:20.466 --> 38:22.267
Destroying my work?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.670
Madeline, what you're doing
is wrong.

38:24.703 --> 38:28.974
You're talking about ending
an entire race.

38:29.007 --> 38:32.644
No. I'm rescuing the human race.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.446
With scientific genocide?

38:34.480 --> 38:37.282
Reed's grandparents
were monsters.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.518
They murdered thousands.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.788
Do you want that potential
in your family? In anyone's?

38:42.821 --> 38:46.358
You have no right to do this.
God made them this way.

38:46.392 --> 38:47.626
(scoffs):
God?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.294
What kind of god
would curse their family

38:49.327 --> 38:50.328
with a son like Noah?

38:51.162 --> 38:52.063
Or Andrew?

38:53.064 --> 38:55.467
The X-Gene is not a curse.

38:55.501 --> 38:58.837
You have seen who my daughter is
and what she can do.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.639
The world is a better place
with her in it.

39:00.672 --> 39:03.675
We both know what your children
did in Atlanta.

39:03.709 --> 39:07.012
I'm sorry, but your daughter
should have never been born.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.716
We can succeed
where Otto failed.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.685
We can save future generations
from this curse.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.320
It's my DNA.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.355
It belongs to the world now,
Lauren.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.659
-Take them into custody.
-No.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.860
Let me handle this.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.262
You said I was a curse
on my family.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.699
You want to see a curse?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.901
(gasps)

39:31.903 --> 39:33.572
(yells)

39:34.740 --> 39:36.542
Go!

39:36.575 --> 39:37.676
Lauren, go!

39:37.709 --> 39:38.944
Go.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.713
Noah, please.

39:41.747 --> 39:45.050
-(screaming)
-No.

39:45.083 --> 39:48.554
Think of it, every collar

39:48.587 --> 39:50.689
at every prison,

39:50.722 --> 39:53.024
every mental hospital,

39:53.058 --> 39:55.761
so much power unleashed.

39:55.794 --> 39:59.431
Today, the uprising
truly begins.

39:59.465 --> 40:01.933
Uh, it almost ended today
in our elevator,

40:01.967 --> 40:03.201
thanks to that psychopath.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.070
I'd say it worked out perfectly.

40:05.103 --> 40:07.706
Rebecca forced Andrew
to decide who he loved.

40:07.739 --> 40:11.409
He chose us.
He sacrificed for us.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.880
Hands on your head. Now!

40:14.913 --> 40:16.748
(grunts)

40:18.416 --> 40:19.718
Got to get back to the scrapyard

40:19.751 --> 40:21.086
before the cops
set up a perimeter.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.454
Yeah, then we'll figure out
what to do

40:22.488 --> 40:23.922
with this traitor
son of a bitch.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.392
-You can start by kissing my...
-Quiet.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.561
What is it, cops?

40:29.595 --> 40:31.429
-No, it's...
-MAN: There they are!

40:31.463 --> 40:33.264
(tires screech)

40:33.298 --> 40:35.166
-Purifiers!

40:44.309 --> 40:45.176
Go, go.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.615
-Reload!
-Reload!

40:51.282 --> 40:53.284
Hey! Take him, go.
I'll hold them off.

40:53.318 --> 40:55.086
You can't.
You'll never get away.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.588
It's like you said, brother,

40:56.622 --> 40:59.090
we're doing this
for the people we love.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.792
Go now!

41:02.127 --> 41:03.795
(tires screeching)

41:12.971 --> 41:15.306
(grunting)

41:18.810 --> 41:21.547
-John!
-Go, get out of here!

44:11.917 --> 44:14.052
It's time to pick a side
on The Gifted.

44:14.085 --> 44:16.387
Here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:18.523 --> 44:19.725
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.395
It's real, and it pulls
people together.
