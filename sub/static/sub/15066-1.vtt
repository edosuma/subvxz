protective over him and Tia?    
 Yeah, but, Lance, you've been

28:15.293 --> 28:19.263
with Tia for two years now.     
In all that time, you couldn't  
tell something was strange, and 

28:19.397 --> 28:22.066
then all of a sudden?           
 I know, but there are        
triggers.                       

28:22.200 --> 28:26.370
And if she was taking her meds, 
everything would be normal.     
But when she goes off her meds  

28:26.504 --> 28:30.841
or there's a stressful situation
that happens in her life...     
 Like her grandfather's death.

28:30.975 --> 28:37.014
 And the campaign.            
 Or rushing into marriage.    
I-I'm just spitballing here.    

28:37.148 --> 28:42.086

Running a campaign.             
She's a strong, independent,    

28:42.220 --> 28:46.623

I mean, yeah, I always thought  
girlfriend was a little bit     

28:46.758 --> 28:52.596
crazy, but not sho'nuff crazy.  
Like white-folk, take-pills,    
lay-on-the-couch crazy.         

28:52.730 --> 28:57.267
But just regular "Girl, you     
crazy," crazy.                  
 I think she needs to see a

 Well, good luck with that.

it behind your back or anything,

01:20:43.021 --> 01:20:49.593
 I was in hiding.             
I was in hiding because that was
the lie my illness told me.     

01:20:49.728 --> 01:20:57.901
That if I told the truth,       
that I would disappear.

Why he fought for me.           
But he did.
