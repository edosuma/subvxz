WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:03.635
Kevin: Mom, dad,
they've got me tied up.

00:03.637 --> 00:07.373
Please, just give them what
they want or they'll kill me.

00:07.375 --> 00:09.742
Man:
Tonight on "open investigation,"

00:09.744 --> 00:13.245
a child of privilege is abducted
outside an L.A. café.

00:13.247 --> 00:16.582
A $3 million ransom
is paid by the FBI,

00:16.584 --> 00:18.650
but Kevin Clark
never returns home.

00:18.652 --> 00:20.452
Two years later,
questions linger.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.255
"Open investigation"
went to Kevin Clark's parents,

00:23.257 --> 00:25.424
George and Janice,
looking for answers.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.093
Every time the phone rings,
I think it's Kevin.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.995
We can't believe
our son's dead.

00:29.997 --> 00:31.463
And George and Janice Clark

00:31.465 --> 00:34.266
may have good reason
to think their son is alive.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.335
A photo recently surfaced online
showing someone

00:36.337 --> 00:38.070
who looks very much
like Kevin Clark

00:38.072 --> 00:40.139
strolling along
a Brazilian beach.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.574
Could the Clarks know
where their son is hiding?

00:42.576 --> 00:45.444
We asked
FBI special agent Jerry shea,

00:45.446 --> 00:47.179
who was in charge of
investigating Kevin's kidnapping

00:47.181 --> 00:48.547
when the young man disappeared

00:48.549 --> 00:51.016
along with $3 million
in taxpayer dollars.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.252
George and Janice Clark
are loving parents

00:53.254 --> 00:56.321
who've suffered the ultimate
injury -- the loss of a child.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.590
The rumor-mongering here
is without merit.

00:58.592 --> 01:01.627
We had to persuade the producers
of "open investigation"

01:01.629 --> 01:02.895
to hold off reporting

01:02.897 --> 01:05.264
on the most important part
of the story.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.465
Sharon:
Which is?

01:06.467 --> 01:08.033
Last April,
the ransom money

01:08.035 --> 01:09.768
started circulating
around Europe.

01:09.770 --> 01:12.571
And three weeks ago,
$10,000 of it

01:12.573 --> 01:14.473
showed up in a bank
here in Los Angeles.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.041
These bills are marked.
How?

01:16.043 --> 01:18.043
The FBI keeps a lot
of fresh hundreds on hand,

01:18.045 --> 01:20.045
printed on paper
from which they've withdrawn

01:20.047 --> 01:22.047
various
security threads.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.482
So that
each ransom is paid

01:23.484 --> 01:24.983
with a different
security thread missing?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.351
Fritz: Which acts
like a fingerprint

01:26.353 --> 01:28.587
tying the cash
back to the specific crime, yes.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.957
In order for this kidnapping
case to revert to the LAPD,

01:31.959 --> 01:33.592
we would need
to examine

01:33.594 --> 01:36.328
every aspect
of the FBI's investigation,

01:36.330 --> 01:39.298
including special agent shea's
personnel file.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.499
That is the reason
my old boss

01:40.501 --> 01:42.301
doesn't want major crimes
to follow up.

01:42.303 --> 01:46.338
It may be unfair, but the bureau
no longer trusts Jerry shea.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.474
And for what it's worth,
neither do I.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.042
Taylor:
Keep that in mind,

01:50.044 --> 01:54.213
because the FBI's sending us
agent shea to consult.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.383
Provenza: Consult.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.452
Here.
Here's an idea.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.989
Why don't we just ask
special agent shea

02:03.991 --> 02:06.358
what he did with the money
and go home?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.794
So, are we solving
a kidnapping gone bad?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.996
Or babysitting
the FBI's number-one suspect

02:10.998 --> 02:13.265
while they handle
the real investigation?

02:13.267 --> 02:15.634
Actually, asking for your help
was my idea.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.170
As I was explaining to
this young man in the elevator,

02:18.172 --> 02:20.139
the FBI's emphasis
on deliberate analysis

02:20.141 --> 02:22.774
means we can't move as hastily
as the LAPD so often does.

02:22.776 --> 02:23.976
Howard.

02:23.978 --> 02:26.111
Shea.
Welcome to major crimes.

02:26.113 --> 02:29.248
Rusty, you were talking
with special agent shea?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.816
Oh, yeah.
He seemed lost

02:30.818 --> 02:32.417
and had gotten off on
the wrong floor several times --

02:32.419 --> 02:34.386
we rode up together
on the elevator. Great kid.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.621
Made me wish
that civilians

02:35.623 --> 02:37.322
were more free
to go within the bureau,

02:37.324 --> 02:39.324
but of course, we've got
tougher security needs.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.927
Uh, buzz, uh, fixed the camera
on my laptop.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.996
Buzz? Really?
[ Laughs ]

02:43.998 --> 02:45.397
Hey, when's the moon landing,
buzz?

02:45.399 --> 02:47.032
Wow,
I never heard that before.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.400
Yeah, but still funny,
though, right?

02:48.402 --> 02:50.369
Rusty,
your laptop's on my desk.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.737
Thanks.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.472
So, Jerry, let me introduce you
to everyone.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.307
This is captain Sharon raydor,
detective Amy Sykes --

02:55.309 --> 02:57.342
you know, don't bother.
I'm terrible with names.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.411
I know that there are two women,
there's four men,

02:59.413 --> 03:01.079
and apparently,
one buzz.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.415
Now, if we're joining
forces, you're gonna
need to play catch-up.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.050
Every bit
of information

03:05.052 --> 03:07.152
that's relevant
to the Clark disappearance

03:07.154 --> 03:09.454
is indexed
on these flash drives.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.023
What am I supposed to do
with this?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.192
I don't know.
Retire?

03:13.194 --> 03:14.493
[ Laughs ]

03:14.495 --> 03:16.528
You'll get used to
my sense of humor.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.430
Just like
I'll get used to yours.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.233
Look, me!
As a suspect. Oh.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.368
Now, the first thing
you need to know is,

03:23.370 --> 03:24.670
the parents
were involved.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.438
The second, third,
and fourth things --

03:26.440 --> 03:28.006
the parents
were involved.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.608
Sharon:
You suggest the opposite

03:29.610 --> 03:31.810
in your interview
with "open investigation."

03:31.812 --> 03:33.812
Purely tactical.
Surely I don't need to explain

03:33.814 --> 03:35.914
the concept of misleading
suspects to<i> you,</i> captain.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.350
And you're so sure the parents
are involved because...?

03:38.352 --> 03:41.220
Because I gave Janice Clark
crystal-clear instructions

03:41.222 --> 03:43.555
on how
to drop off that money,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.457
but Janice claims that
she found a burner cellphone

03:45.459 --> 03:48.894
en route instructing her
to deviate from the plan --

03:48.896 --> 03:51.630
a phone, by the way, which
disappeared with the money.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.232
Flynn: And although
they were hurting financially

03:53.234 --> 03:55.100
at the time
of the kidnapping,

03:55.102 --> 03:56.768
now they're spending money
like crazy,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.437
including several
hundred thousand dollars

03:58.439 --> 04:01.940
on remodeling their home
and world travel.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.642
Sanchez: Well,
if the parents were in on it,

04:03.644 --> 04:05.310
doesn't that mean
the son was involved, too?

04:05.312 --> 04:07.112
Sharon: And if
they split the money,

04:07.114 --> 04:08.847
where did Kevin Clark
actually go?

04:08.849 --> 04:12.150
Well, Kevin is probably surfing
in South America as we speak,

04:12.152 --> 04:14.319
if he's sober enough
to maintain his balance.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.787
As you just heard,

04:15.789 --> 04:17.456
he's got some serious
substance-abuse problems.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.991
[ Chuckles ]
And you buy that picture?

04:18.993 --> 04:22.060
I mean, I've seen more
convincing images of bigfoot.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.862
Tao:
Holy smokes!

04:23.864 --> 04:26.999
18 separate video files
on Kevin's abduction?

04:27.001 --> 04:28.433
How -- how
is that possible?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.202
That little shopping area
from which he disappeared

04:30.204 --> 04:32.304
has as many security cameras
as the Pentagon.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.406
There is no more public place
in Los Angeles

04:34.408 --> 04:37.676
to record a kidnapping
than lunch café.

04:37.678 --> 04:40.145
Have you ever run
all 18 angles

04:40.147 --> 04:42.080
associated
with Kevin's abduction

04:42.082 --> 04:44.916
using a synchronized
360-degree panorama?

04:44.918 --> 04:46.318
Is that possible?

04:46.320 --> 04:47.719
We do it all the time
on "badge of justice."

04:47.721 --> 04:49.721
Oh, geez.
"Badge of justice,"
I love that show.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.556
I'm the technical advisor.
Mike tao.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.226
No kidding! Hey, okay, one thing
that bugs me about "badge,"

04:54.228 --> 04:56.628
you can't get DNA samples back
in eight hours.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.063
Yeah,
I tell them that,

04:58.065 --> 05:00.565
but show-business time
is different than ours.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.135
Oh, God.
Sharon:
Mike, in real life,

05:03.137 --> 05:06.238
where would we be able to view
all these video files at once?

05:06.240 --> 05:08.006
"Badge of justice"
has the space,

05:08.008 --> 05:09.508
but I can only take
a few of us.

05:09.510 --> 05:14.012
Oh. Oh, well, in that case,
captain, may I suggest

05:14.014 --> 05:17.182
that while you're reliving the
beginning, Sanchez, Sykes, and I

05:17.184 --> 05:19.785
will follow the trail
of the ransom money.
Great, lieutenant.

05:19.787 --> 05:23.355
Buzz, how long will it take you
to organize all these videos?

05:23.357 --> 05:25.524
Well, I'd need at least
nine discrete projectors

05:25.526 --> 05:26.858
to cover
each p.O.V.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.660
But if "badge" would let us
borrow theirs...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.862
How are
they formatted?

05:30.864 --> 05:32.264
Ooh,
get comfy.

05:32.266 --> 05:34.733
¶¶

05:36.103 --> 05:37.569
excuse me,
lieutenant?
Yeah?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.338
Lieutenant Mike,
John wants to know

05:39.340 --> 05:40.672
if his character
would say,

05:40.674 --> 05:42.507
"drop your gun
and grab the concrete,"

05:42.509 --> 05:44.509
or, "grab some concrete
and drop the gun."

05:44.511 --> 05:46.611
Drop the gun first,
grab some concrete second.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.680
Thank you. Pink pages
coming at you tonight.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.350
Copy that.
Wow, you really
rule the roost around here.

05:51.352 --> 05:52.718
Oh, it's one big
team effort.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.786
You know, I would introduce you
to the cast,

05:54.788 --> 05:56.521
but they're all
on location today.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.923
[ Mockingly ]
On location today.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.425
Did anyone see the "badge
of justice" season opener?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.027
I did!
Great!

06:02.029 --> 06:04.463
The squad solved the jewel heist
by culling together footage

06:04.465 --> 06:06.932
from multiple sources
right here in this space.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.367
These are
the controls.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.435
Can you show me
how they work?
Tao: Uh, no.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.237
This is a prop.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.106
Buzz is running
the projectors.

06:14.108 --> 06:15.774
Oh,
it looks so real.

06:15.776 --> 06:16.875
Mm.
It sure does.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.177
So, Mike,
with the cyclorama effect,

06:19.179 --> 06:22.748
the security videos are less
about singular perspective,

06:22.750 --> 06:24.983
more about interplay
between elements, is that right?

06:24.985 --> 06:26.184
Theoretically.

06:26.186 --> 06:28.954
...16, 17, 18.
Okay, lieutenant.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.489
We're ready to roll.

06:30.491 --> 06:35.961
Meet Kevin Clark as he was
on Tuesday, June 4, 2013,

06:35.963 --> 06:39.531
at 2:12 P.M.
sitting in the patio of lunch

06:39.533 --> 06:42.634
with his two friends,
Jamie wade and Dan Morris.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.404
Sharon: I'd like to talk
to them a.S.A.P.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.305
Now that we know the players,
let's begin.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.708
Agent shea,
if you would narrate.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.576
Hitting play. All right.
[ Device beeps ]

06:51.578 --> 06:53.845
Jamie and Danny drove here
with Kevin.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.648
That's his car parked
across the street at the meter.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.250
So, they sit here,
they have their coffee,

06:58.252 --> 06:59.651
they talk,
they talk, they talk.

06:59.653 --> 07:04.423
Until this gray sedan,
a stolen Chrysler 300,

07:04.425 --> 07:06.825
pulls up on the opposite side
of the street.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.026
Now watch Kevin.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.494
He clocks it.

07:09.496 --> 07:10.729
He says, "hey, I --
that guy's a friend of mine.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.497
Uh, I'll see you
in a few minutes."

07:12.499 --> 07:14.766
These two have no choice
but to wait.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.870
Now, the plates on the sedan
were swiped off of an escalade

07:18.872 --> 07:21.540
which was parked in the city
of industry maybe 19 Miles away.

07:21.542 --> 07:24.843
What about the driver
of the Chrysler 300?
You couldn't I.D. Him?

07:24.845 --> 07:26.845
18 different angles, none giving
us the face of the driver.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.314
Now look at this.
He walks right up to the car.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.916
He starts talking
to the guy

07:30.918 --> 07:33.151
as a fire truck drives by
in the background, right?

07:33.153 --> 07:36.321
He's kind of looking around.
He's talking to him, right?

07:36.323 --> 07:37.889
And what's this?

07:37.891 --> 07:40.492
He walks around the front
of the car and he gets in.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.395
And then
they drive away.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.996
Now, buzz,
is there any way

07:44.998 --> 07:47.532
that we can fast-forward
20 times speed?

07:47.534 --> 07:49.534
If you want.
Please.

07:49.536 --> 07:51.002
[ Device beeps ]
Okay, okay.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.871
They're sitting there
texting Kevin.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.406
We know that
from phone records.

07:54.408 --> 07:56.141
They're paying the bill.
Okay.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.542
They go
across the street,

07:57.544 --> 07:59.411
they put money
in Kevin's meter, right?

07:59.413 --> 08:00.946
They hang out,
texting again.

08:00.948 --> 08:01.947
Texting Kevin.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.748
All right.
Now, what do they do?

08:03.750 --> 08:06.017
They walk up and down the street
killing time,

08:06.019 --> 08:08.753

26:36.362 --> 26:40.698
that just popped up
in your bank account last month?

26:40.700 --> 26:42.666
That money
isn't mine.

26:43.469 --> 26:45.836
It belongs
to guy lafontaine.

26:46.839 --> 26:50.240
Who the hell
is guy lafontaine?

26:50.242 --> 26:53.110
I sold a novel
inspired by the kidnapping,

26:53.112 --> 26:56.313
and because the FBI
frowns on that kind of thing,

26:56.315 --> 27:00.017
I created guy lafontaine
as my nom de plume, a pen name.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.252
The 100 grand
is lafontaine's advance.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.755
I just haven't had time
to create an account for him.

27:04.757 --> 27:07.291
Shea's not only a crook,
he's crazy.

doesn't have an ending.

also has a nom de plume.

our morgue

Now,
can you think why?

27:35.021 --> 27:39.323
Michael sparks was also shot
with a fabrique nationale 5.7?

27:40.626 --> 27:43.060

to figure out.

a registered fn 5.7.

27:52.438 --> 27:56.974
So, as I've been saying
all along, it was the parents.

I arrest them,

is it?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.232
No. It's not.

My father died

Kevin had it.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.784
Why didn't you
tell us that?

33:07.786 --> 33:10.287
Because we knew
what Jerry thought all along.

33:10.289 --> 33:12.389
That Kevin
had planned his own kidnapping,

33:12.391 --> 33:13.957
that he had walked off
with the money.

33:13.959 --> 33:17.094
We were afraid that
if the FBI knew about the gun,

33:17.096 --> 33:19.696
that they would stop
looking for our son.

you showed up

35:28.427 --> 35:30.327
with $100 bills
obtained from the kidnapping.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.662
Stop calling it a kidnapping.
It's only a kidnapping

35:32.664 --> 35:35.332
if you abduct someone
against their will, and
that's not what happened.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.666
Danny, don't.
Let's call a lawyer.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.401
No, it's time to clear this up

35:38.403 --> 35:41.938
The whole fake kidnapping
was Kevin's idea.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.273
He planned
every step.

35:43.275 --> 35:44.541
He chose
the location,

35:44.543 --> 35:46.510
pulled Mike, Jamie,
and me in on it,

35:46.512 --> 35:48.678
mostly to get even
with his parents.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.480
For what?

35:50.482 --> 35:53.350
After Kevin got out of rehab,
they cut back on his allowance,

35:53.352 --> 35:55.452
like, a lot,
and he was furious.

35:55.454 --> 35:58.221
And so he put together
this fake kidnapping.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.590
And after all
we went through with him,

36:00.592 --> 36:02.325
Kevin changed
his mind.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.693
He wanted
to back out.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.328
And where would that have left
all of us?

36:05.330 --> 36:07.430
Mike argued with him,
pointed out we'd go to jail,

36:07.432 --> 36:10.834

Kevin pulls out a gun, and
he and Michael fight over it.

Well, that could be true.
<i> And from then on,</i>

36:17.142 --> 36:19.843
<i> we had to do things</i>
<i> Mike's way.</i>
One problem, though.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.778
<i> It's odd.</i>
<i> It's just odd.</i>

36:21.780 --> 36:25.315
<i> I mean, you say that Mike</i>
<i> was calling all the shots.</i>

36:25.317 --> 36:26.750
Did that
include the one

36:26.752 --> 36:28.885
that ended up
in the back of his head?

36:28.887 --> 36:31.521
His house was torn up and tossed
when we got there.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.523
He had a stash space,
but it was empty.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.993
Hmm. Wonder where his share
of the ransom went.

You had been so careful,

blew all that

36:43.302 --> 36:45.569
by spending a wild night
at sultry dolls,

36:45.571 --> 36:48.071
throwing around ransom money
like it was no big deal.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.140
And then, suddenly,
he was dead.

36:50.142 --> 36:53.243
And that's where your story
begins to fall apart a little.

36:53.245 --> 36:54.544
Actually,
a lot.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.979
"A" for effort,
Danny boy.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.714
But while you've been
sitting here waiting for us,

36:57.716 --> 36:59.616
we did a little search
of your apartment,

36:59.618 --> 37:03.687

what we found.

You idiot.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.327
You're the one who flipped out
over Mike going to sultry dolls.
What? That's ridiculous.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.262
Don't blame me.
Jamie shot him.
The gun was found
in your house.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.830
Hey, I want to cooperate.
You think
they're gonna believe that?

37:13.832 --> 37:15.298
I don't want to be blamed
for any of this.

37:15.300 --> 37:16.866
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm gonna cooperate here.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.202

Hey, I'm cooperating.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.077
<i> That's -- no, no.</i>
Since this investigation
was started by the FBI,

37:27.079 --> 37:29.446
I suggest that
we allow the federal government

37:29.448 --> 37:31.114
to prosecute
this case.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.749
I like the way you think,

37:32.751 --> 37:35.385

"dating," chief,

we mean it in the old-fashioned
sense of the word.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.085
Yeah,
very old-fashioned.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.487
In fact, I'm surprised
we don't have a chaperone.

just a friendship,
