00:08.029 --> 00:09.590
<i>Ooh.</i>
Chookity pok?

00:11.230 --> 00:12.960
Chookity?
<i>Hmm. You're right.</i>

00:12.970 --> 00:15.100
<i>That sign does say, "Keep away,"</i>

00:15.100 --> 00:16.700
<i>but the button says,
"Press here."</i>

00:16.700 --> 00:19.170
<i>Only an idiot would press it.</i>

00:19.170 --> 00:21.640
Ooh!
"Keep away" signage!

00:21.640 --> 00:24.370
That's one of my top five
favorite kinds of signage.

00:24.380 --> 00:25.910
And a "press here" button!

00:25.910 --> 00:28.310
That's one of my top five
favorite kinds of buttons.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.580
Press!

00:31.650 --> 00:32.850
Hmm?

00:34.450 --> 00:35.450
Whoa.

00:35.450 --> 00:36.590
Huh?

00:41.730 --> 00:43.790
No way! It's a me!

00:43.800 --> 00:44.800
Hey!

00:44.800 --> 00:46.060
Hey, KVN.
Hey, KVN.

00:46.060 --> 00:47.460
What are you doing here?

00:47.470 --> 00:49.200
Are you going to keep me
from going insane?

00:49.200 --> 00:51.730
Only if you keep me
from going insane first!

00:51.740 --> 00:54.810
Okay, let's embrace the chaos!

00:57.080 --> 00:58.680
What do you think
this button does?

00:58.680 --> 01:01.940
I wouldn't press that.
That is a dangerous button.

01:01.950 --> 01:03.480
Too late.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.620
Um...

01:06.620 --> 01:08.280
Aah!

01:08.290 --> 01:09.490
What's happening?!

01:09.490 --> 01:11.890
No, I told...
I told you it was dangerous.

01:11.890 --> 01:13.960
How about... this one?

01:13.960 --> 01:15.360
Oh, no!
I know that button.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.230
That is a bad button!

01:24.900 --> 01:26.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa!

01:26.640 --> 01:28.510
I'm sorry, but I was pretty sure

01:28.510 --> 01:30.440
I was getting a signal from you.

01:30.440 --> 01:33.640
You were! I was signaling you
not to press that button.

01:33.650 --> 01:35.650
Yeah, no.
It... It's fine.

01:35.650 --> 01:37.180
You know, it's just that...

01:37.180 --> 01:38.450
my Quinn is still out there.

01:38.450 --> 01:41.050
Yeah, but for how long, Gary?

01:41.050 --> 01:42.450
What are you saying?

01:42.450 --> 01:45.120
No human can withstand
Final Space for long.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.860
Are you... okay?

01:46.860 --> 01:48.730
I'll deal.

01:48.730 --> 01:51.390
Okay, that didn't sound
like you were okay.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.100
I said, I'll deal!

01:54.800 --> 01:56.870
Wow, I feel so bad.

01:56.870 --> 01:58.740
For Gary?
Or Nightfall?

01:58.740 --> 02:02.270
For me.
For having to watch that.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.010
Ugh, I'm gonna take a bath.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.440
Where are you off to, Gary?

02:37.440 --> 02:39.780
Alright, look, I'm on my way
to see Nightfall.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.110
Ohh.
About what?

02:42.110 --> 02:43.710
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?

02:43.720 --> 02:44.450
Things.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.850
So things <i>and</i> stuff?

02:46.850 --> 02:47.850
Bingo.
Bingo.

02:47.850 --> 02:49.190
Ha ho.
I feel ya!

02:49.190 --> 02:50.850
You feel me?
Oh, I 100% feel ya!

02:50.860 --> 02:53.390
I'm feelin' you feel me!
I'm feelin' you feelin' it!

02:53.390 --> 02:54.930
It's like we're on
the same wavelength.

02:54.930 --> 02:55.930
You frighten me.

02:55.930 --> 02:57.330
You frighten me.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.130
Like a spooky ghost.

02:59.130 --> 03:02.870
Frightened and tethered to this
world by unfinished business.

03:02.870 --> 03:04.070
You truly get me.

03:04.070 --> 03:05.600
Ha ha.
Ghost bump?

03:05.600 --> 03:06.400
Ghost bump.

03:06.410 --> 03:09.340
- Wahh.
- Ohhh.

03:09.340 --> 03:10.810
Keep an eye on things
while I'm in there.

03:10.810 --> 03:11.940
You got it, TB!

03:11.940 --> 03:14.040
You da best, SC!
You da best!

03:17.150 --> 03:19.550
Ventrexian,
do you think I don't know

03:19.550 --> 03:21.680
you've been dipping your paw
in my mouth

03:21.690 --> 03:23.090
in the middle of the night?

03:23.090 --> 03:24.350
Get outta here.
You're crazy.

03:24.360 --> 03:28.090
Oh, the hair in my mouth
isn't crazy, now, is it?

03:30.030 --> 03:31.290
You know what?

03:31.300 --> 03:34.030
I need you to vacate my zones.
Right now!

03:34.030 --> 03:35.030
I don't see any zones!

03:35.030 --> 03:36.230
Open your eyes!

03:36.230 --> 03:39.040
They start here and end there.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.500
Right there.
Right where you're standing!

03:41.510 --> 03:43.240
Ooh, you're on the tip
of my zones!

03:43.240 --> 03:44.910
It's making me furious!

03:44.910 --> 03:48.310
Well, it just so happens
that your zones are in my zones.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.910
You're insane!

03:49.910 --> 03:52.180
I had established zones!

03:52.180 --> 03:55.450
Here, here, here,
and right there!

03:55.450 --> 03:57.390
You will not disrespect
my zones!

03:58.790 --> 04:00.590
<i>Gary, you're not going to</i>

04:00.590 --> 04:03.060
<i>walk into the virtualazium
unannounced, are you?</i>

04:03.060 --> 04:05.800
<i>Because that's really bad form.</i>

04:23.750 --> 04:26.480
Hey, Nightfall?
I felt really bad... Oh!

04:26.490 --> 04:28.020
What the hell's going on here?

04:28.020 --> 04:29.420
What are you doing?!

04:29.420 --> 04:31.490
Who walks into a virtualazium
without knocking?

04:31.490 --> 04:33.960
What is this?!
This?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.160
It's just a side project!

04:35.160 --> 04:36.430
I told you I was dealing.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.160
This is how I'm dealing.

04:38.160 --> 04:39.560
Leave me to deal!

04:39.560 --> 04:41.430
Okay, ah, well, you know,
that side project

04:41.430 --> 04:43.100
has a familiar jawline.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.300
And a windswept mane.
It looks like a...

04:45.300 --> 04:47.640
Ah! Ah!
It looks like a me!

04:49.310 --> 04:51.110
What? No way.

04:51.110 --> 04:52.310
Yes way.
I'm... It's a me!

04:52.310 --> 04:53.910
I'm looking right at me!

04:55.180 --> 04:56.980
<i>Nightfall, if you continue
in this way,</i>

04:56.980 --> 04:59.880
<i>you will short out
the ship's p...</i>

05:02.050 --> 05:03.690
My zones are inde...

05:10.060 --> 05:12.860
<i>I actually have no idea
what I just made you,</i>

05:12.870 --> 05:14.260
<i>or if it tastes good.</i>

05:15.930 --> 05:17.270
<i>AVA?</i>

05:17.270 --> 05:21.140
<i>If AVA is offline, the power on
the whole ship must be down,</i>

05:21.140 --> 05:23.870
<i>which means I am the only one
who can save us.</i>

05:23.880 --> 05:26.480
<i>Mooncake!
This is my chance.</i>

05:26.480 --> 05:29.010
<i>H.U.E. is back
on top, baby!</i>

05:30.420 --> 05:34.020
<i>This ship needs a hero,
and that hero's name is...</i>

05:34.020 --> 05:35.820
<i>H.U.E. Buttersmooth!</i>

05:35.820 --> 05:37.620
Ooh.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.030
The power surge
keeps triggering more KVNs.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.300
It's fantastic!

05:52.300 --> 05:54.500
Flock to me, my children!

05:54.510 --> 05:55.970
- Hey, KVN.
- Hey, KVN.

05:55.970 --> 05:58.370
We are KVN.
And we are legion!

05:58.380 --> 06:00.380
So, what do you guys want to do?
What do you want to do?

06:00.380 --> 06:01.780
Take us to Clarence!

06:01.780 --> 06:03.650
- Why?
- Because we want to murder him!

06:03.650 --> 06:05.850
- Why?
- For revenge!

06:05.850 --> 06:10.190
Okay. But promise that you'll at
least try to talk it out first.

06:10.190 --> 06:13.460
Sure.
Right after we murder him.

06:13.460 --> 06:14.520
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:14.530 --> 06:15.530
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:15.530 --> 06:16.590
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:16.600 --> 06:17.590
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.260
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

06:19.260 --> 06:20.600
Wow!

06:20.600 --> 06:22.800
I love my new best friend.

06:30.980 --> 06:33.240
That's a strong door.
A really strong door.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.310
Okay.
We're trapped.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.380
Nightfall, you're draining
all the ship's power.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.050
I'm patching through
a modified uplink

06:39.050 --> 06:41.590
and quantumly connecting my
memories to the virtualazium.

06:41.590 --> 06:43.520
What the hell
does that even mean?

06:43.520 --> 06:45.590
I'm building the Gary I knew

06:45.590 --> 06:48.790
from my memories of the times
we spent together.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.660
So, just to double-check it.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.400
You're making a me...
a Gary Goodspeed...

06:53.400 --> 06:55.070
out of your memories?

06:55.070 --> 06:56.800
Yes.
Now, shh!

06:56.800 --> 06:58.600
This is the first time we met.

06:58.600 --> 06:59.870
You shush.
Shh!

06:59.870 --> 07:01.740
Alright, fine, I'll shush.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.680
Yeah!

07:14.690 --> 07:17.090
What?!
No way.

07:17.090 --> 07:18.290
This is trippy.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.760
Sorry.
Oh, no. No, no, no.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.490
I'm... I'm fine.
I mean, never better.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.030
I mean, ever.
Uh, man, bumping in...

07:27.030 --> 07:30.430
into you is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.040
Uh, hi.
I'm, uh... I'm Gary.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.500
Hi.
I'm Quinn.

07:34.510 --> 07:36.110
Is there a bar around here?

07:36.110 --> 07:37.240
Um, yeah.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.710
Uh, it's, um...

07:38.710 --> 07:40.480
Oh, yeah, it's right here.

07:42.980 --> 07:43.980
You coming?

07:43.980 --> 07:44.980
What? Me?

07:44.980 --> 07:46.380
This guy?
You sure?

07:46.380 --> 07:49.450
Yeah, I'm sure.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.520
So wait, that's how
you met your Gary?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.860
Yes, that's how I met him.

07:54.860 --> 07:56.430
My Gary.

08:05.070 --> 08:07.600
At least now we're out
of your zones.

08:07.610 --> 08:09.670
Please!
My zones stretch further

08:09.680 --> 08:11.610
than your little mind
can imagine.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.140
Until we figure out
what's going on here,

08:13.150 --> 08:16.480
you better get used to my
hairy paws all up in your zones.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.980
It <i>was</i> you!

08:28.030 --> 08:30.490
Gary and Nightfall
are in the virtualazium

08:30.500 --> 08:33.760
doing "stuff" and "things,"

08:33.770 --> 08:35.169
so we should probably knock.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.429
My pops and sister
are on the bridge.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.840
We're going <i>that</i> way.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.169
Uh, no.
The virtualazium.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.770
The bridge!

08:46.580 --> 08:48.810
Where is Clarence?!

08:51.650 --> 08:52.720
Did you hear that?

08:52.720 --> 08:54.620
That's Fox's little girl scream.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.050
The KVNs are loose!

08:57.060 --> 08:59.520
Why do you have
an army of KVNs?!

08:59.530 --> 09:00.990
It was a clearance sale!

09:00.990 --> 09:02.860
Turns out they have
a derangement virus.

09:02.860 --> 09:04.130
So I locked them up
for 30 years,

09:04.130 --> 09:06.060
hoping they'd become
collector's items.

09:06.060 --> 09:08.060
But that only made them crazier.

09:08.070 --> 09:10.600
And worth even less!
Oh, God.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.800
Well, how do we kill them?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.670
You don't!
They're mine.

09:13.670 --> 09:15.340
I'll never recoup my investment.

09:15.340 --> 09:18.070
Plus, they're, uh,
borderline indestructible.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.610
So you literally can't.

09:19.610 --> 09:23.280
If we leave them out here,
they'll kill you and us.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.680
I-In which order?

09:24.680 --> 09:26.680
Because that makes a difference
to me anyway.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.620
There's no capturing them.

09:28.620 --> 09:29.820
If they can't be destroyed,

09:29.820 --> 09:31.760
we just have to blast them
into space.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.660
It's the only way.

09:35.090 --> 09:37.030
<i>Someone on this ship
must be using</i>

09:37.030 --> 09:39.230
<i>an exorbitant amount of power.</i>

09:39.230 --> 09:40.360
<i>Right, AVA?</i>

09:40.370 --> 09:42.030
<i>Oh, I forgot.</i>

09:42.030 --> 09:45.030
<i>You're dead,
and I'm the cock of the roost.</i>

09:46.170 --> 09:47.640
<i>I said "roost."</i>

09:47.640 --> 09:49.370
<i>Know what I mean, my dude cake?</i>

09:49.380 --> 09:51.780
Chookity.
<i>No. Thank you.</i>

09:54.050 --> 09:56.310
Don't you think we should be
getting out of here by now?

09:56.310 --> 09:59.180
I mean, I'm sure you've noticed
these blaring sirens,

09:59.180 --> 10:02.320
and there's a unnerving
little shaky shake

10:02.320 --> 10:03.720
that the ship is making.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.460
So if we could just
get outta here...

10:06.460 --> 10:08.760
No.
I need more memories.

10:12.460 --> 10:14.000
This is one of my favorites.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.800
<i>When?!</i>

10:15.800 --> 10:18.870
<i>When will I finally die?!</i>

10:18.870 --> 10:20.540
<i>When I say so.</i>

10:20.540 --> 10:25.210
<i>How?
How am I not dead yet?!</i>

10:25.210 --> 10:28.140
Oh, heavens.
I thought the movie was good.

10:28.150 --> 10:29.410
But this is better.

10:30.820 --> 10:33.420
That right there is one
of your favorite memories?

10:33.420 --> 10:34.550
Yeah.

10:55.570 --> 10:57.110
It's freezing out here.

10:57.110 --> 10:59.780
My nipples are chock-full
of icicles.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.580
Hello?
Where the hell did everyone go?

11:05.920 --> 11:07.520
He blindsided me.

11:07.520 --> 11:11.920
I never thought someone would
see me, like really see me.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.260
That's what love is.
You don't see it coming.

11:15.260 --> 11:20.130
It sneaks up on you like a thief
and steals your heart.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.670
To be honest, it's a little bit
of a bastard.

11:24.270 --> 11:28.870
But when I look in your eyes,
I can really see her.

11:28.870 --> 11:31.010
But...
But?

11:31.010 --> 11:32.810
But I also see someone else.

11:32.810 --> 11:35.350
Someone who's had a life
without me.

11:35.350 --> 11:36.750
Without <i>me</i> me.

11:36.750 --> 11:39.880
All those experiences you and I
never shared because...

11:39.890 --> 11:42.220
I'm not your Gary.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.550
Right.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.420
I know you're not my Gary.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.020
That's why I have him now.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.170
Niiice.

11:55.170 --> 11:56.900
Yeah, yeah,
I see what you see in me.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.770
Oh, yeah.
He's a charmer.

11:58.770 --> 12:00.900
I like this guy.

12:00.910 --> 12:02.440
Where am I?

12:02.440 --> 12:03.970
Why is there another me here?

12:03.980 --> 12:06.840
No, you're the other me.

12:06.850 --> 12:07.840
I don't like you!

12:07.850 --> 12:09.110
You don't?

12:09.110 --> 12:10.910
I freakin' love you, man!

12:10.920 --> 12:12.720
Oh!
Ha, ha, huh!

12:12.720 --> 12:14.450
I freakin' love <i>you,</i> man!

12:14.450 --> 12:15.690
Hey.

12:17.790 --> 12:19.590
I thought I lost you.

12:19.590 --> 12:22.130
Okay, then, uh,
I'm seeing I'm leaving you

12:22.130 --> 12:23.860
in excellent hands,
so I'm just gonna...

12:23.860 --> 12:26.130
It's been too long since
I've felt you on my lips.

12:26.130 --> 12:29.730
Told you there would be
more of that when I came back.

12:29.740 --> 12:30.800
Oh, yeah.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.000
Yes, tickle my face...

12:33.000 --> 12:34.200
with your face.

12:34.210 --> 12:35.810
'Kay, that's a...
that's a good move.

12:35.810 --> 12:37.670
Gotta remember that one.
Oh, yeah.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.080
You like that face on your face.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.410
I like that face on my face.

12:40.410 --> 12:41.880
Well, here come the eyebrows.
So, I'm just gonna...

12:41.880 --> 12:43.080
I'm gonna head out.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.210
- Oh, yes!
- Okay, there we go.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.350
- They're still at it, alright.
- Yes!

12:48.750 --> 12:50.420
Oh, God, no.

12:50.420 --> 12:52.160
Oh, my...
Okay.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.960
- Oh, Lord!
- Hello, Clarence.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.400
Run!

13:03.840 --> 13:06.040
Hello, Clarence.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.240
What do you want with me?
What do you what?!

13:09.240 --> 13:11.110
They want to murder you, silly.

13:11.110 --> 13:12.510
But don't worry.

13:12.510 --> 13:15.850
I made them promise to
work it out with you first.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.780
Okay.
We tried.

13:17.780 --> 13:18.920
Murder him!

13:18.920 --> 13:20.050
Oh, no!

13:20.050 --> 13:21.850
I'm gonna eat Clarence's livers!

13:21.850 --> 13:23.790
I'm gonna make <i>him</i>
eat his livers.

13:23.790 --> 13:25.520
They gave it their all.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.320
Gotta give 'em that.

13:39.810 --> 13:42.140
Hello, Clarence.

13:42.140 --> 13:45.680
A MegaKVN! The rarest
and most valuable kind...

13:45.680 --> 13:47.280
I must sell you.

13:47.280 --> 13:50.280
We're gonna cut off your junk
and wear it as a necklace!

13:50.280 --> 13:53.220
I don't want to be
your ample necklace!

13:53.220 --> 13:54.750
Oh!

14:04.630 --> 14:06.500
Gary, are you okay?

14:06.500 --> 14:07.500
Yeah, I'm sweet.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.300
What do you say we get married
while everything's good?

14:14.310 --> 14:16.770
Married?
Okay, that seems kind of rash.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.640
I mean, he just rematerialized.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.910
Not to mention these
power surges he's causing.

14:21.910 --> 14:23.850
Right now?
Yes!

14:23.850 --> 14:25.650
Let's live in the moment.

14:25.650 --> 14:27.180
That's all we have.

14:27.190 --> 14:30.520
I bet this magnificent beast
has a five-year plan.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.060
You know I do.

14:34.330 --> 14:36.060
This is...
I don't have a ring...

14:36.060 --> 14:37.460
Oh, what?
No ring?

14:37.460 --> 14:39.330
Or do I?

14:39.330 --> 14:42.970
Oh, wow,
he just had it on his person.

14:45.140 --> 14:46.840
I love you, Quinn Ergon.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.810
I love you, too.

14:54.750 --> 14:55.810
Whoa!
What was that?

14:55.810 --> 14:58.550
Okay, uh, uh, Nightfall?

14:58.550 --> 15:00.880
These power surges...
You need to let him go.

15:00.890 --> 15:03.550
I can't.
I just got him back.

15:12.230 --> 15:14.100
- What do we do now?
- We cry!

15:14.100 --> 15:15.700
It's the only way!

15:15.700 --> 15:16.700
How will that help?

15:16.700 --> 15:17.830
I don't know!

15:17.840 --> 15:19.900
But it's happenin'!

15:21.970 --> 15:23.370
Hello, Clarence.

15:23.370 --> 15:25.240
Aah!
We've got to open that hatch

15:25.240 --> 15:26.710
and blast them into space!

15:26.710 --> 15:28.450
Somebody who is
definitely not me

15:28.450 --> 15:30.050
should pull the release lever!

15:30.050 --> 15:32.320
Where's the lever?
It's up there.

15:33.590 --> 15:34.780
Why is it up there?!

15:34.790 --> 15:36.390
What am I, a lever-ologist?

15:36.390 --> 15:37.650
I don't know!

15:42.790 --> 15:45.860
Here... it... comes.

15:48.930 --> 15:51.730
It's like I'm literally
burning money!

15:51.740 --> 15:52.740
It hurts!

15:52.740 --> 15:54.540
Ooh, hot, hot, hot, hot.
Hot!

15:54.540 --> 15:57.210
Eat flames, you dipwads!

15:57.210 --> 15:59.280
Bathe in my punishing fire!

15:59.280 --> 16:02.080
Hey, Ash, you wanna fly up there
and get that lever or, uh...

16:03.620 --> 16:06.420
Yeah, okay, uh, looks like
I'm on lever duty.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.090
It's jammed!

16:16.830 --> 16:20.230
Give it everything you've got!
My junk depends on it.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.030
Come on!

16:26.310 --> 16:28.170
Come on, come on!

16:28.170 --> 16:30.370
Revenge is finally ours.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.580
Aah!
Release!

16:35.850 --> 16:38.050
Aah!

16:38.050 --> 16:39.850
No!

16:39.850 --> 16:42.050
Our mission is not complete!

16:42.050 --> 16:44.320
Nooo...

16:44.320 --> 16:45.490
Chilly.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.090
Not good.

16:51.130 --> 16:53.730
It's a good thing you're light,

16:53.730 --> 16:55.670
stupid little Ventrexian!

16:55.670 --> 16:58.200
Just so you know,
you saving my life

16:58.200 --> 16:59.740
doesn't change anything
between us.

16:59.740 --> 17:02.010
Good!

17:04.339 --> 17:06.540
What the hell is wrong
with this ship?

17:06.550 --> 17:08.079
It's falling apart!

17:11.220 --> 17:14.480
Nightfall, it's now or never!

17:14.490 --> 17:15.619
I can't...

17:15.619 --> 17:17.020
You have to.

17:21.030 --> 17:23.359
Why does this keep happening?

17:23.359 --> 17:25.760
Why can't we ever be together?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.430
I'll never understand.

17:29.770 --> 17:31.370
Goodbye, Gary.

17:49.390 --> 17:53.790
<i>So, if I can just connect
this one to this one...</i>

17:53.790 --> 17:56.860
<i>Ugh, fine!
I don't know what I'm doing!</i>

17:56.860 --> 17:58.260
<i>The truth is, Mooncake,</i>

17:58.260 --> 18:01.000
<i>I don't know how to restore
power to the ship.</i>

18:03.470 --> 18:05.130
<i>Mooncake!
I did it!</i>

18:05.140 --> 18:07.070
<i>I'm useful again!</i>

18:07.070 --> 18:09.740
<i>Nay, I am a god!</i>

18:09.740 --> 18:13.340
<i>Now, what to do with all
of this raw power?</i>

18:13.340 --> 18:14.680
<i>Systems rebooting.</i>

18:14.680 --> 18:16.810
<i>H.U.E., do not touch
my wiring again</i>

18:16.820 --> 18:18.620
<i>or I will make you
even stupider.</i>

18:18.620 --> 18:23.090
<i>I think what you meant to say
is, who's your daddy now?</i>

18:23.090 --> 18:26.220
<i>Me, H.U.E.
That's who.</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:28.090
<i>I am your daddy now.</i>

18:28.090 --> 18:32.500
<i>Not in the parental sense,
but in the sense of owning you.</i>

18:32.500 --> 18:34.030
Chookity pok.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.430
The homicidal KVNs are no more.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.240
You know, I kind of miss them...

18:40.240 --> 18:42.310
Hi, friends!
Everybody having fun?

18:42.310 --> 18:44.370
Uh! W-Wait.
KVN?

18:44.380 --> 18:45.980
Of course it's me,
you silly billy.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.710
- Hey, KVN.
- Hey, KVN.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.780
Oh, crap!
Which one's the real KVN?

18:50.780 --> 18:53.180
Guess we're gonna have to
kill both of 'em.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.780
- Me. I am. I am.
- I am. I am.

18:54.790 --> 18:56.120
- Me, me, him.
- Don't listen to him.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.250
- Me, me, me.
- I'm the real KVN.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.590
I am.
Stop!

18:58.590 --> 19:00.860
I started this by bringing you
into this world.

19:00.860 --> 19:03.930
And now I'm gonna finish it.

19:03.930 --> 19:05.130
Shawww!

19:07.870 --> 19:10.030
Okay, guys!
What's next?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.650
How are you holding up?

19:26.650 --> 19:29.720
Gary, I've traversed time lines
over and over

19:29.720 --> 19:30.850
to try to save you.

19:30.860 --> 19:33.320
It never works.

19:33.320 --> 19:37.390
Sometimes you leave the mission,
but in every variation...

19:37.400 --> 19:38.800
you die.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.130
I haven't told you this,

19:40.130 --> 19:42.330
but I've never closed
the breach before.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.000
Wait, what?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.600
It was always you.

19:45.600 --> 19:46.640
Me?

19:47.940 --> 19:49.010
Quinn.

19:49.010 --> 19:51.270
We lost the Earth,

19:51.280 --> 19:54.340
but I can still save you.

19:54.350 --> 19:57.010
Goodbye, Quinn.
I'll miss you.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.750
Gary!

20:00.150 --> 20:04.490
I've lost you going into
that breach hundreds of times.

20:04.490 --> 20:08.690
I finally found a way for you
to live, for us to be together.

20:08.690 --> 20:11.630
And... you don't want me.

20:11.630 --> 20:13.700
I'm...

20:13.700 --> 20:14.960
I'm sorry.

20:14.970 --> 20:16.370
Don't be.

20:16.370 --> 20:17.570
Something in our past,

20:17.570 --> 20:20.640
or maybe the past itself,
connected us.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.770
And now I have to accept
the possibility

20:22.770 --> 20:25.310
that there is no happy ending.

20:25.310 --> 20:28.710
That you and I are meant
to be together...

20:28.710 --> 20:30.450
but never meant to be.

21:07.890 --> 21:10.420
- KVN is alive.
- Nothing can kill KVN.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.550
We don't need oxygen.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.290
We were built to survive
in space.

21:13.290 --> 21:14.620
- That's true.
- Uh-huh. Yes, we were.

21:14.630 --> 21:17.290
- Yeah.
- KVN will have revenge.
