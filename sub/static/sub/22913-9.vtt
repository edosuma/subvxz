WEBVTT

00:02.891 --> 00:05.592
Now you have the Grail.
We must keep it safe again.

00:05.627 --> 00:07.027
The Pope is on his way.

00:07.062 --> 00:08.895
He'll use it to call
for another Crusade.

00:08.931 --> 00:10.797
The Holy Grail is in France.

00:10.833 --> 00:12.232
It is a means with which the Pope

00:12.267 --> 00:13.567
will attempt to supplant you.

00:13.602 --> 00:15.101
I have mustered an army of mercenaries.

00:15.137 --> 00:17.204
I do not need an army
to fight the Templars!

00:17.239 --> 00:18.872
The Temple Master is my closest friend!

00:18.907 --> 00:20.140
He's my brother.

00:20.175 --> 00:21.575
And Your Grace will forgive me,

00:21.610 --> 00:23.710
but your brother is
sleeping with your wife.

00:23.745 --> 00:25.212
She's having my child.

00:25.247 --> 00:27.581
Another man will raise
that child as his own.

00:35.457 --> 00:39.826
You have no honor.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.230
What's this?

00:43.265 --> 00:45.465
To pay for your mercenary army,
in case you're right.

00:45.500 --> 00:47.801
You cannot ask a mother
to give up her child.

00:47.836 --> 00:49.970
Then choose one, or I'll choose.

00:50.005 --> 00:52.472
Aah!

00:52.507 --> 00:53.974
I will bring Isabella here.

00:54.009 --> 00:55.842
Away from the corruption
of the French Court.

00:55.878 --> 00:57.811
And then I will bring
my child into the world

00:57.846 --> 00:59.179
under the skies of Navarre.

00:59.214 --> 01:01.915
Dear boy.
This is the Saracens you've met.

01:01.950 --> 01:04.650
They sow doubt. Keep the faith.

01:04.686 --> 01:06.419
Why did you have Godfrey killed?

01:06.455 --> 01:08.455
He possessed the Grail. I am the Pope.

01:08.490 --> 01:09.623
Kill them all!

01:09.658 --> 01:10.857
Aah!

01:13.662 --> 01:15.128
Forgive me.

01:15.163 --> 01:18.365
It suited me to let
you think he would die.

01:23.639 --> 01:24.704
Tancrede.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.313
Master.

01:29.311 --> 01:30.310
How many?

01:30.345 --> 01:31.511
300.

01:31.546 --> 01:32.712
More on the way.

01:32.748 --> 01:34.447
Look at these.

01:34.483 --> 01:35.515
Blood Knights.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.050
The best of the best.

01:40.522 --> 01:43.223
You're sure these men can
take on the the Templars?

01:43.258 --> 01:45.959
They are as battle-hardened
and as brutal.

01:45.994 --> 01:48.361
And they have one advantage.

01:48.397 --> 01:49.462
Which is?

01:49.498 --> 01:51.698
They fight dirty.

01:51.733 --> 01:57.270
If you're right about Landry,
the Templars fight dirty, too.

01:59.308 --> 02:05.178
Cedric, Sebastien, Francois...

02:05.213 --> 02:07.647
All their deaths were in vain.

02:07.683 --> 02:09.515
All this bloodshed.

02:09.550 --> 02:13.420
Even as far back as our Master,
Godfrey, murdered on the road.

02:13.455 --> 02:15.422
Be in no doubt it is true.

02:15.457 --> 02:18.491
It all leads back to the
head of our own church,

02:18.527 --> 02:20.694
Christ's Vicar on earth,

02:20.729 --> 02:24.664
our spiritual master, Pope Boniface.

02:26.969 --> 02:28.835
Brothers, we must act.

02:28.870 --> 02:30.036
But be in no doubt about the gravity

02:30.072 --> 02:31.705
of what I'm about to ask you.

02:31.740 --> 02:34.841
Tomorrow, I will ride to
the commandry near Chartres

02:34.876 --> 02:37.243
where I will speak with
our Grand Master, Jacques.

02:37.279 --> 02:40.113
For when he learns
what has happened here,

02:40.148 --> 02:43.850
I believe he will call on
every Templar in Christendom

02:43.885 --> 02:46.286
to take up arms against the Pope.

02:48.423 --> 02:50.557
Then you are ordering us to join you

02:50.592 --> 02:52.792
in a war with our own church?

02:54.730 --> 02:56.463
I will order no man to ride with me.

02:56.498 --> 02:59.265
It is a momentous thing
to move against the Pope.

02:59.301 --> 03:01.735
You each have the right to
plead Brother's Privilege

03:01.770 --> 03:03.269
and to remain in the house.

03:03.305 --> 03:05.638
For those of you that wish to join me,
know this...

03:05.674 --> 03:07.574
You could be branded a heretic.

03:07.609 --> 03:10.543
I hardly need to remind you
of the consequences of that.

03:10.579 --> 03:14.080
If that happens,
you will be excommunicated,

03:14.116 --> 03:17.117
your soul will be denied
all holy sacraments,

03:17.152 --> 03:19.886
and your body will be
burned at the stake.

03:42.477 --> 03:44.477
Sophie, you're released from my service.

03:44.513 --> 03:46.246
Your Grace?

03:46.281 --> 03:48.314
We shall say that I forced
you to escort me to Navarre,

03:48.350 --> 03:49.949
and that you did so under protest.

03:49.985 --> 03:51.418
No.

03:51.453 --> 03:53.586
What I am about to do
carries great risk.

03:53.622 --> 03:55.021
You must not be a part of it.

03:55.057 --> 03:57.924
Forgive me, my lady.

03:57.959 --> 03:59.492
But if you'll have me,

03:59.528 --> 04:01.861
I should like to return
with you to the Navarre.

04:01.897 --> 04:03.963
Are you sure?

04:03.999 --> 04:05.965
With all my heart.

04:07.636 --> 04:10.370
Make way!

04:32.694 --> 04:34.861
It's colder than I remembered.

04:34.896 --> 04:37.230
Forbidding.

04:37.265 --> 04:41.000
Find Isabella and arrange
for her to meet with me.

04:41.036 --> 04:42.435
Make sure you're not seen.

04:58.620 --> 05:00.153
So you're one of them now?

05:01.623 --> 05:03.089
Mm.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.757
What have you been doing?

05:04.793 --> 05:06.326
We thought you were dead.

05:06.361 --> 05:10.730
I've been learning their ways,
training with them.

05:10.765 --> 05:12.159
Why?

05:12.513 --> 05:15.502
Because...

05:15.537 --> 05:19.372
they want me to take Godfrey's
place in their order.

05:22.852 --> 05:24.911
I don't understand why these people

05:24.946 --> 05:26.513
care so much about the Grail.

05:26.548 --> 05:30.950
Because... you know this...
It's dangerous.

05:30.986 --> 05:32.852
In the wrong hands, it can be used

05:32.888 --> 05:34.454
to justify war and bloodshed.

05:34.489 --> 05:36.589
Then why not burn it?

05:36.625 --> 05:39.058
It's a Christian relic,
and they're Saracens.

05:39.094 --> 05:40.693
If it's that dangerous, burn it.

05:40.729 --> 05:42.262
Be done with it forever.

05:42.297 --> 05:47.033
I can't tell you everything,
but I will tell you this...

05:47.068 --> 05:50.436
The Grail is not just the Cup of Christ.

05:52.841 --> 05:56.075
It goes back further than you think.

05:56.111 --> 05:59.312
It means more than you think.

06:02.614 --> 06:08.154
Master, the Pope has denounced you.

06:08.927 --> 06:13.662
Grand Master De Molay has
issued an order for your arrest.

06:13.952 --> 06:16.129
It makes no difference.
I'll speak with him.

06:16.164 --> 06:17.230
We ride as planned.

06:17.265 --> 06:18.398
I'll make my case

06:18.433 --> 06:20.066
to Grand Master De Molay myself.

06:34.282 --> 06:36.616
Her Grace, Queen Joan.

06:49.164 --> 06:51.931
Is it true?

06:52.321 --> 06:54.267
Queen Elena is dead?

06:56.282 --> 06:57.370
Had I been a better Queen,

06:57.405 --> 07:00.406
I would have managed to
end things peace... fully.

07:03.787 --> 07:06.980
My wife has won us a
great victory in Navarre.

07:07.015 --> 07:08.448
To Queen Joan!

07:08.483 --> 07:09.882
Queen Joan!

07:09.918 --> 07:11.184
And France!

07:11.219 --> 07:12.452
And France!

07:12.487 --> 07:14.287
France.

07:18.260 --> 07:20.560
How is our child?

07:20.595 --> 07:22.495
Kicking.

07:22.933 --> 07:25.131
Did the others kick?

07:25.166 --> 07:26.366
I can't remember.

07:26.401 --> 07:29.402
Of course. All babies kick.

07:29.955 --> 07:33.106
Didn't we say our children were regal,
even in the womb?

07:33.530 --> 07:35.720
Too regal to kick?

07:38.913 --> 07:41.180
Forgive me. My journey has been long.

07:41.216 --> 07:42.682
I-I would like to rest.

07:42.717 --> 07:44.417
Of course.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.373
You called for me?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.409
One moment.

08:04.444 --> 08:07.078
Landry, I know I have no right,

08:07.113 --> 08:09.847
but whatever happens tomorrow,
you will not ride alone.

08:09.883 --> 08:13.184
- I would like to be at your side.
- I know.

08:13.220 --> 08:15.753
That's why I'm giving you this.

08:15.789 --> 08:17.855
This is yours.

08:17.891 --> 08:19.490
If I take this back,

08:19.526 --> 08:22.060
my devotion to the Temple
will be unrelenting.

08:22.095 --> 08:24.495
But I must ask that my
orders never cause me

08:24.531 --> 08:26.968
to betray the Brotherhood of Light.

08:32.443 --> 08:34.072
Kneel.

08:38.745 --> 08:40.818
Tancrede De Hauteville,

08:41.011 --> 08:43.715
who was our Brother, is at the door

08:43.750 --> 08:46.784
and requests readmission
to the house which he left

08:46.820 --> 08:48.419
through his own fault,

08:48.455 --> 08:51.956
and he awaits the mercy of the House.

08:54.294 --> 08:58.963
Good Brother, do you know
this mane who was our Brother?

08:58.999 --> 09:00.965
Has he done anything to which he may not

09:01.001 --> 09:02.433
nor should not re-enter the House?

09:02.469 --> 09:05.570
For if he has not,
he should regain entry.

09:06.084 --> 09:07.472
He has not.

09:08.822 --> 09:12.210
Good Brother, you have behaved foolishly

09:12.245 --> 09:14.279
in that you left our
order and our House.

09:14.314 --> 09:18.149
I am greatly vexed that
I have acted foolishly,

09:18.184 --> 09:22.220
and I will make amends willingly
to establish the House.

09:36.936 --> 09:40.772
Rise, Tancrede De Hauteville.

09:40.807 --> 09:44.475
You are our Brother once more.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.839
Brother.

09:55.087 --> 09:56.487
Mother!

09:56.523 --> 09:57.522
Isabella.

09:58.958 --> 10:00.958
I'm so glad you're safe.

10:00.994 --> 10:02.927
I need you to pack your belongings.

10:02.962 --> 10:05.463
Do it yourself. Say nothing to anyone.

10:06.002 --> 10:07.699
We're leaving for Navarre.

10:08.578 --> 10:09.767
What?

10:09.803 --> 10:11.169
I cannot explain now,

10:11.204 --> 10:12.970
but I promise you all will be well.

10:13.006 --> 10:14.672
What happened in Navarre?

10:14.708 --> 10:18.876
Elena lost her mind
over her son's murder.

10:21.752 --> 10:23.314
Why didn't you tell me?

10:23.350 --> 10:26.351
- Tell you what?
- You had me believe

10:26.386 --> 10:28.019
that your only involvement
in Lluis's death

10:28.054 --> 10:29.520
was to give De Nogaret the remedy.

10:29.556 --> 10:30.822
That's all I did!

10:30.857 --> 10:32.123
Isabella, you jumped from the carriage

10:32.158 --> 10:34.325
at exactly the right moment.

10:34.361 --> 10:35.960
You knew what you were doing.

10:35.995 --> 10:38.329
Why didn't you confide in me?

10:38.365 --> 10:40.798
I will always protect you.

10:40.834 --> 10:43.334
You made a mistake. I won't judge you.

10:43.370 --> 10:44.802
You told me I've made a mistake,

10:44.838 --> 10:46.671
and then you say you won't judge me?!

10:46.706 --> 10:49.040
Isabella, don't fight me just
because you feel ashamed.

10:49.075 --> 10:50.475
I'm your mother.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.288
Isabella!

10:56.683 --> 10:59.517
We can't resolve this now,
but there will be time.

11:00.276 --> 11:02.387
Get ready.

11:02.422 --> 11:05.256
I will send Sophie when it is time.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.505
Landry?

11:20.540 --> 11:23.107
What makes you think Jacques
de Molay will help you?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.676
Because he is the Grand Master

11:25.712 --> 11:27.712
of the Order of the Knights Templar.

11:27.747 --> 11:29.013
It is his responsibility

11:29.048 --> 11:30.848
to protect the Order
against any threats.

11:30.884 --> 11:34.185
And you're going to
tell him that the Pope,

11:34.220 --> 11:36.788
God's representative on Earth,
is a liar?

11:36.823 --> 11:38.723
I'll tell him everything...
Godfrey, the Grail.

11:38.758 --> 11:40.858
He needs to know what kind
of man this Pope really is.

11:40.894 --> 11:43.094
Supposing he believes you. Then what?

11:43.709 --> 11:46.964
We will muster the combined
forces of the Temple in France.

11:47.252 --> 11:49.474
And we will challenge the Pope.

11:51.825 --> 11:54.739
I've lost the Grail twice,

11:54.774 --> 11:57.175
and I will not lose it again.

12:09.522 --> 12:11.556
Master, forgive me.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.625
I plead Brother's Privilege

12:14.661 --> 12:16.594
and request permission
to remain in the House.

12:16.629 --> 12:18.830
It is your right, Brother Anthony.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.999
Master, I, too,
plead Brother's Privilege

12:22.035 --> 12:25.203
and request permission
to remain in the house.

12:28.808 --> 12:31.008
Master, I plead Brother's Priv...

12:32.278 --> 12:34.912
You act according to conscience.

12:34.948 --> 12:36.881
Your decisions are respected.

12:39.686 --> 12:41.586
If we ride alone, do we still ride?

12:41.621 --> 12:44.755
Our Brothers have a choice. I do not.

12:57.837 --> 13:01.412
Master,
we ride against everything we know.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.536
But we are with you.

13:08.915 --> 13:11.382
By the grace of God!

13:11.417 --> 13:13.718
By the grace of God!

13:42.332 --> 13:45.033
Their loyalty is a testament
to your leadership.

13:45.068 --> 13:47.035
I'm no great leader.

13:48.338 --> 13:51.873
If you're with the Brotherhood of Light,
you should know that.

13:51.908 --> 13:52.941
The Queen?

13:56.375 --> 13:58.276
Part of me knew.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.648
Part of me always knew.

14:00.684 --> 14:03.017
I saw the way you looked at her.

14:03.053 --> 14:06.070
It was never the look of a monk.

14:07.824 --> 14:09.557
You know about the child?

14:09.593 --> 14:11.659
Aye.

14:11.695 --> 14:14.162
A child she wants me to
have nothing to do with.

14:14.197 --> 14:15.330
And don't start.

14:15.365 --> 14:16.965
I've had enough of that from Gawain.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.167
I am not Gawain.

14:19.202 --> 14:21.836
However disappointed
I might be with you,

14:21.871 --> 14:24.072
I would never try to kill you.

14:24.107 --> 14:26.407
I should have seen what
was happening to Gawain.

14:26.443 --> 14:29.344
I didn't realize until it was too late.

14:29.379 --> 14:31.713
We lost Gawain on the docks at Acre.

14:31.748 --> 14:34.282
It's time we both accepted that.

14:49.299 --> 14:51.532
It seems they're expecting us.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.723
Master Berenger.

15:16.021 --> 15:18.026
Master Landry.

15:18.061 --> 15:21.029
You must know there's an
order for your arrest.

15:21.064 --> 15:23.031
We have no quarrel with you.

15:23.066 --> 15:26.434
We're simply here to
see the Grand Master.

15:26.469 --> 15:28.436
Is he in residence?

15:48.019 --> 15:49.824
Grand Master.

15:58.319 --> 16:01.335
You've got gray in your beard.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.809
How in God's name have we come to this?

16:07.844 --> 16:09.811
Templars at war with the Pope?

16:09.846 --> 16:11.813
It's against everything we stand for.

16:11.848 --> 16:13.815
Boniface had Godfrey killed,

16:13.850 --> 16:16.584
and then he killed my
men and stole the Grail.

16:16.619 --> 16:18.019
He is mad for power.

16:18.054 --> 16:19.954
So am I! So are you!

16:19.989 --> 16:21.823
So is everyone who leads men!

16:21.858 --> 16:24.025
- We need to stop him.
- Why?

16:24.060 --> 16:26.160
He's got the Grail.
He can lead us back to the Holy Land.

16:26.196 --> 16:28.362
He has no interest in the Holy Land.

16:28.398 --> 16:30.631
He seeks a united Europe under his rule.

16:32.869 --> 16:34.969
Suppose you're right.

16:35.004 --> 16:37.364
That's even better for us.

16:37.912 --> 16:41.275
The Grail has been
restored to the Church.

16:41.311 --> 16:43.277
The Pope will worry about Europe,

16:43.313 --> 16:46.514
and you and I can go
back to the Holy Land.

16:46.549 --> 16:48.702
Everybody gets what they want.

16:49.089 --> 16:51.719
I'm not sure that is what I want.

16:52.986 --> 16:55.056
What's happened to you?

16:55.091 --> 16:57.725
All you ever wanted
was to go back there.

16:57.761 --> 16:59.806
I don't know.

17:01.094 --> 17:05.333
I feel as though the
closer I get to the Grail,

17:05.367 --> 17:07.987
the further I have gone from God.

17:08.244 --> 17:11.204
Landry, take hold of yourself.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.241
You're the Master of the Paris Temple.

17:13.276 --> 17:15.742
Now,
as your friend and your Grand Master,

17:15.779 --> 17:19.413
I'm asking you to withdraw your
accusations against the Pope.

17:19.711 --> 17:22.030
I cannot withdraw them.

17:22.952 --> 17:26.686
You must call together all the Temples,

17:26.723 --> 17:29.190
find the Pope, challenge him,

17:29.225 --> 17:31.353
and recover the Grail.

17:32.228 --> 17:34.896
I'm sorry, Landry.

17:34.931 --> 17:36.831
You give me no choice.

17:36.866 --> 17:39.167
If you do not withdraw,
you will be brought

17:39.202 --> 17:43.104
before a tribunal to
account for your actions.

17:43.139 --> 17:44.672
One more time, Landry.

17:44.707 --> 17:46.427
Please.

17:47.043 --> 17:49.101
Do you withdraw?

17:51.548 --> 17:53.449
I do not.

17:54.617 --> 17:56.348
He was right.

17:56.606 --> 17:58.586
Who was?

18:31.821 --> 18:33.888
Sophie.

18:34.384 --> 18:36.757
I want you to take this
letter to the Temple.

18:36.793 --> 18:38.314
We leave at dusk.

18:38.636 --> 18:40.569
Is he coming with us?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.331
I don't know.
I can only hope.

18:43.366 --> 18:45.967
I trust you're well rested.

18:49.772 --> 18:52.273
My own bed has done wonders for my rest.

18:52.308 --> 18:54.075
Excellent.

18:54.110 --> 18:56.444
Then I should like you to join
me for supper this evening.

18:56.479 --> 18:58.012
A feast.

18:58.047 --> 18:59.747
Tonight?

18:59.782 --> 19:03.150
I can think of no
better time or occasion

19:03.186 --> 19:06.187
than your triumphant return
as our victorious Queen.

19:10.862 --> 19:14.028
One of your coins from Navarre.

19:14.063 --> 19:16.080
Charming.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.167
Is something the matter?

19:20.203 --> 19:24.538
You seem... agitated.

19:24.574 --> 19:26.999
Supper would be wonderful.

19:28.077 --> 19:30.177
Good.

19:38.521 --> 19:40.821
He knows. Something's wrong.

19:40.857 --> 19:42.794
He always hated those coins.

19:43.084 --> 19:44.825
He can't know.

19:44.861 --> 19:46.294
Why would he invite you to supper

19:46.329 --> 19:49.230
if he knew you were carrying
another man's child?

19:57.263 --> 20:00.931
Say the word,
and I can get you out of here.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.434
I will not leave.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.203
I intend to stand trial.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.739
Master, there will be no mercy.

20:08.774 --> 20:11.842
They will use everything
they know about you.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.110
You could end up at the stake.

20:13.145 --> 20:14.244
I know.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.046
Then why remain?

20:16.082 --> 20:18.282
The Pope is here,

20:18.317 --> 20:20.250
which means the Grail is here.

20:20.286 --> 20:22.186
While they're all
occupied with my trial,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.933
you can recover the Cup.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.725
I will not sacrifice
your life for the Grail.

20:27.760 --> 20:30.160
I was willing to let
you sacrifice yours.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.931
Also, the Brothers must hear
the truth about the Pope,

20:33.966 --> 20:36.066
even if it means I die for it.

20:36.102 --> 20:39.203
No matter what they do to me,
you must find the Grail and go.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.604
Open these doors.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.772
We need to get the
prisoner to the tribunal.

20:41.807 --> 20:44.608
Do I have your word?

20:44.644 --> 20:47.144
Quickly. Do I have your word?

21:54.547 --> 21:58.849
We are here today to judge
the actions of this man,

21:58.884 --> 22:02.853
Landry du Lauzon,
Master of the Paris Temple.

22:02.888 --> 22:07.391
Master Berenger, you may begin.

22:11.864 --> 22:14.531
Landry du Lauzon, you stand accused

22:14.567 --> 22:16.967
of committing five of
the Nine Great Crimes.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.635
You're accused of laying a hand

22:18.671 --> 22:20.704
on another Brother
out of anger or wrath,

22:20.740 --> 22:22.339
conspiring with the Saracens,

22:22.374 --> 22:24.875
striking a Christian
with a sharp object,

22:24.910 --> 22:27.311
falsely accusing another
Brother of a crime,

22:27.346 --> 22:30.681
and breaking the seal of Master.

22:30.716 --> 22:34.265
How do you respond to these charges?

22:35.071 --> 22:36.720
After Godfrey's death,

22:36.756 --> 22:40.324
I was ordered by His Holiness
to find the Holy Grail.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.493
Everything I have done has been
in service of that mission.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.895
You do not deny the charges?

22:45.345 --> 22:46.363
Deny or accept,

22:46.398 --> 22:48.398
nothing I say can change
the will of this council,

22:48.434 --> 22:50.267
whose job it is to find me guilty.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.437
How dare you insult the
sanctity of the Temple!

22:53.472 --> 22:57.007
It is His Holiness who insults
the sanctity of this Temple

22:57.042 --> 22:59.877
by having murdered a Temple Master!

22:59.912 --> 23:01.779
Quiet!

23:01.814 --> 23:04.348
You tell them how you had
Godfrey killed on the road.

23:04.383 --> 23:07.351
Your Holiness need not
respond to these accusations.

23:07.386 --> 23:11.955
I have no issue with answering, Master.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.891
The accused is correct.

23:13.926 --> 23:17.461
It was me who had Godfrey killed.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.002
All clear on the west wall.

23:39.652 --> 23:44.221
You admit to plotting the
death of a Temple Master?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.957
A Temple Master who was a traitor

23:46.992 --> 23:49.697
and who formed alliances with Saracens.

23:49.955 --> 23:53.730
Everything Godfrey did
was to protect the Grail.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.832
On the contrary.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.433
You know as well as I do

23:56.468 --> 23:58.235
that it was Godfrey who let the Saracens

23:58.270 --> 23:59.937
into the tunnels under Acre,

23:59.972 --> 24:03.607
which led to the death of
hundreds of Templar Brothers

24:03.642 --> 24:05.409
and brought about the fall of Acre

24:05.444 --> 24:08.579
and with it the loss
not only of the Grail,

24:08.614 --> 24:11.982
but also of our last
stronghold in the Holy Land.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.917
Can this be true?

24:16.889 --> 24:20.457
The city was already lost
regardless of Godfrey's actions.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.626
What was done was done
to save the Grail.

24:22.661 --> 24:24.027
But how?

24:24.063 --> 24:26.063
The Grail sank to the bottom of the sea.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.499
I don't know.

24:29.535 --> 24:32.836
And when, miraculously,
it resurfaced in France,

24:32.872 --> 24:35.606
Godfrey yet again
conspired with the Saracens

24:35.641 --> 24:38.008
to keep it hidden from his Holy Church!

24:38.043 --> 24:40.544
Godfrey is not here to
explain his intentions.

24:40.579 --> 24:43.680
No doubt he'd be having the
same difficulty you're having.

24:43.716 --> 24:48.352
Do you deny that you yourself
had identical intentions,

24:48.387 --> 24:52.189
and that you also
conspired with the infidels

24:52.224 --> 24:54.291
to hide the Grail?

24:56.695 --> 24:58.395
I cannot deny it.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.997
But I can say this...

25:00.032 --> 25:01.665
My intentions and my actions

25:01.700 --> 25:03.734
were only ever in service of the Grail

25:03.769 --> 25:07.871
and to deliver it into your hands,
which is what I did,

25:07.907 --> 25:12.876
on my honor, before God and
all my Brothers here present.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.480
On your honor, Master?

25:18.164 --> 25:20.684
Perhaps it is time for
your Brothers here present

25:20.719 --> 25:23.253
to learn a little more about your honor.

25:23.289 --> 25:27.324
Grand Master, I wish to call a witness.

25:50.610 --> 25:53.679
And what did Master
Landry do when he heard

25:53.714 --> 25:55.214
that a Brotherhood of Light Saracen

25:55.249 --> 25:56.682
had been killed by a Templar?

25:56.717 --> 25:58.183
He turned the Templar over

25:58.219 --> 26:00.738
to the Saracen's father for punishment.

26:00.996 --> 26:02.387
Forgive me.

26:02.423 --> 26:05.891
The Temple Master turned over
one of his Knights to a Saracen

26:05.926 --> 26:07.728
for punishment?

26:07.921 --> 26:09.789
Why?

26:10.047 --> 26:13.622
To solidify his pact
with the Saracen leader.

26:13.848 --> 26:16.682
They plotted to find the Grail together.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.157
Do you deny this?

26:39.193 --> 26:42.561
As I said,
I acted only in service of the Grail!

26:42.596 --> 26:45.564
Once again, you admit to
making bargains with Saracens

26:45.599 --> 26:49.334
ahead of your duty to protect
your Templar Brothers?!

26:49.370 --> 26:52.571
I, too, was a victim of his
disregard for his Brothers.

26:52.606 --> 26:55.173
I helped him find the Grail.

26:55.209 --> 26:58.877
But once we had it,
my presence seemed inconvenient to him.

26:59.070 --> 27:02.781
He struck me. He beat me.

27:02.816 --> 27:04.983
He tried to kill me.

27:08.289 --> 27:10.956
Gawain, I understand your pain,
but tell the truth.

27:10.991 --> 27:13.292
You always understood my pain!

27:13.327 --> 27:15.160
It was you who tried to kill me.

27:15.195 --> 27:17.763
I've heard enough!

27:17.798 --> 27:20.632
It is time to render judgment.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.804
Please, Grand Master,

27:25.839 --> 27:27.506
there is more I must tell you.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.586
More?

27:30.907 --> 27:34.112
It pains me to bring such
disrepute upon our House.

27:34.148 --> 27:35.514
You may continue, Brother.

27:35.549 --> 27:38.941
Our proceedings here
will not be made public.

27:40.254 --> 27:42.721
He had relations with a woman,
Grand Master,

27:42.756 --> 27:45.490
a married woman who
now carries his child.

27:45.526 --> 27:46.658
Bastard.

27:46.694 --> 27:49.603
- Seize him!
- You bastard!

27:50.182 --> 27:54.434
Landry,
you reveal yourself by your actions.

27:56.904 --> 27:59.504
Brother Gawain, you may continue.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.640
He considered giving up everything...

28:01.675 --> 28:05.243
His Brothers, the Grail...
All for this woman.

28:05.279 --> 28:07.145
Do you deny it?

28:07.181 --> 28:09.848
Yet again,
you have forsaken your Brothers,

28:09.883 --> 28:12.050
and you lay with a married woman.

28:13.220 --> 28:14.753
It is true.

28:14.788 --> 28:16.655
Who is this woman?

28:16.690 --> 28:18.724
It is none of your concern!

28:18.759 --> 28:22.728
When you threaten the
reputation of our Temple,

28:22.763 --> 28:26.498
your actions become our concern.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.304
What is the name of this
woman who bears your child?

28:45.786 --> 28:48.420
I cannot say.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.767
Landry du Lauzon,

29:01.802 --> 29:05.771
you are found guilty of five
of the Nine Great Crimes.

29:05.806 --> 29:08.240
You will be excommunicated.

29:08.275 --> 29:10.542
Then a fire will be lit,

29:10.577 --> 29:14.446
and you will be burned in
the flames of righteousness.

29:14.481 --> 29:19.951
And when you die,
your soul will not ascend to heaven!

29:25.484 --> 29:27.094
Judas!

29:28.629 --> 29:30.061
Judas.

29:30.097 --> 29:32.731
Does that make you Jesus?

29:47.448 --> 29:49.481
Aah!

30:09.403 --> 30:11.069
Your Grace.

30:13.574 --> 30:16.316
The King asked me to bring you this.

30:17.845 --> 30:20.345
Surely this is a mistake.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.447
He has given me my own dress?

30:22.483 --> 30:24.483
The King instructs you
to wear it tonight.

30:24.518 --> 30:26.051
He has had it adjusted.

30:26.086 --> 30:27.819
Did His Grace say why?

30:27.855 --> 30:29.988
No, Your Grace.

30:33.594 --> 30:36.127
Have you seen my maid, Sophie?

30:36.163 --> 30:38.697
She left earlier today
and did not return.

30:38.732 --> 30:40.699
I will need help to dress.

30:40.734 --> 30:42.262
I have not.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.035
Also, Your Grace,

30:44.071 --> 30:46.371
the King has asked for
you to wear your hair up

30:46.406 --> 30:48.240
and braided in the back.

31:07.361 --> 31:10.028
The very definition of beauty.

31:12.099 --> 31:14.266
Your Grace charms me.

31:14.301 --> 31:18.737
All this intrigue. What's the occasion?

31:18.772 --> 31:21.206
A surprise.

31:21.241 --> 31:24.843
I hope it pleases you as
much as it pleases me.

31:24.878 --> 31:26.778
Shall we?

31:36.590 --> 31:38.757
It's all for you, My Queen.

31:43.397 --> 31:46.464
Wherefore in the
name of God the all-powerful,

31:46.500 --> 31:49.568
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,

31:49.603 --> 31:52.604
of the blessed Peter,
Prince of the Apostles,

31:52.639 --> 31:54.506
and of all the Saints,

31:54.541 --> 31:59.110
we deprive Landry du Lauzon
of the communion of the body

31:59.146 --> 32:01.446
and blood of our Lord.

32:01.481 --> 32:05.617
We now separate him from the
society of all Christians.

32:05.652 --> 32:09.621
We declare him
excommunicate and anathema.

32:09.656 --> 32:11.122
We judge him damned,

32:11.158 --> 32:15.160
with the devil and his demons,
to eternal fire!

32:15.195 --> 32:17.062
Fiat! Fiat! Fiat!

32:17.097 --> 32:20.565
Fiat! Fiat! Fiat!

32:20.601 --> 32:23.635
Fiat! Fiat! Fiat!

32:23.670 --> 32:25.437
Forgive me, your Holiness.

32:25.472 --> 32:27.172
Stop.

32:29.376 --> 32:31.083
Hold him.

32:36.516 --> 32:38.817
It seems she has come to
beg for Landry's life.

32:38.852 --> 32:41.519
Landry will burn.
Nothing can be done about that.

32:46.226 --> 32:49.527
Are you the woman who
carries his bastard child?

32:49.563 --> 32:51.796
Bless you, no.

32:51.832 --> 32:53.698
That would be the Queen of France.

32:54.499 --> 32:55.433
I'm his mother,

32:55.469 --> 32:57.836
and I have news about the
Grail you need to hear.

33:02.519 --> 33:06.322
Thank you for the
information about the Queen.

33:06.357 --> 33:08.290
But as far as the Grail is concerned,

33:08.326 --> 33:09.959
there is nothing you can tell me.

33:09.994 --> 33:12.127
- See her out.
- I know you want to use the Grail

33:12.163 --> 33:14.697
to bring together all Christians
in Europe under the Church,

33:14.732 --> 33:17.299
but a single cup cannot
unite Christendom.

33:17.335 --> 33:20.369
Do not underestimate
the power of a symbol,

33:20.404 --> 33:22.371
even if it is just a cup.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.673
But it isn't just a cup, Your Holiness.

33:24.709 --> 33:27.943
All those colorful stories

33:27.979 --> 33:31.947
and rumors about the Grail
since the time of the Apostles,

33:31.983 --> 33:36.383
how it can heal the
sick and raise the dead.

33:36.738 --> 33:39.188
You seem doubtful, Your Holiness.

33:39.223 --> 33:41.190
I'm sorry to disillusion you, Madam,

33:41.225 --> 33:43.192
but those are just stories.

33:43.227 --> 33:46.362
Though my predecessors seem
to have believed in its power,

33:46.397 --> 33:47.730
I cannot.

33:47.765 --> 33:49.798
Those are just tales of magic

33:49.834 --> 33:52.568
designed to lure pagans into the Church.

33:52.603 --> 33:54.870
There's no secret to the Grail.

33:54.906 --> 33:56.205
Of course there is.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.374
And how would you know?

33:58.409 --> 34:00.075
I am the one Godfrey entrusted

34:00.111 --> 34:02.682
to guard the Grail all of these years.

34:06.284 --> 34:07.716
What if I told you something

34:07.752 --> 34:10.553
that will change what
you know of God entirely?

34:10.992 --> 34:13.155
And let me guess...

34:13.190 --> 34:17.259
All I need to do to gain
this marvelous knowledge

34:17.295 --> 34:19.828
is to spare Landry's life.

34:19.864 --> 34:23.331
After you hear what I have to say,
I promise,

34:23.367 --> 34:27.803
you will want to spare his life,
whether I ask you to or not.

34:36.547 --> 34:38.246
Thank you.

34:38.282 --> 34:39.782
You've done the hard work for me.

34:51.462 --> 34:52.661
You're Brotherhood of Light?

34:59.003 --> 35:01.470
You fight like one.

35:05.643 --> 35:07.209
Who are you working for?

35:07.244 --> 35:08.877
Hmm.

35:08.913 --> 35:10.980
I'll die before I let
you take the Grail.

35:11.015 --> 35:13.015
Then you will die.

35:40.811 --> 35:43.579
I must speak with the accused alone.

35:43.614 --> 35:46.115
But Your Holiness,
we are in the middle of the Anathema.

35:46.150 --> 35:47.416
Things have changed.

35:47.451 --> 35:49.618
New information has come to light.

35:49.654 --> 35:52.287
This excommunication cannot continue.

35:52.323 --> 35:54.590
- But Your Holiness...
- Am I understood?

35:54.625 --> 35:57.026
Out! Out!

36:23.888 --> 36:26.689
Would you care to dance, my love?

36:27.277 --> 36:30.159
If Your Grace will excuse me,
I'm in no mood to...

36:30.194 --> 36:31.527
You will dance.

36:59.190 --> 37:01.924
I've always loved that dress.

37:05.429 --> 37:07.930
Do you remember the
last time you wore it?

37:07.965 --> 37:10.566
I do not.

37:10.601 --> 37:13.702
It was the night you danced with Landry.

37:17.274 --> 37:21.197
The night he convinced
you to return to my bed.

37:21.912 --> 37:23.579
He spoke well on your behalf.

37:23.614 --> 37:25.581
Of course.

37:25.616 --> 37:27.800
He's a good friend.

37:30.454 --> 37:33.018
I have something to tell you...

37:34.125 --> 37:35.624
Something I've been waiting to say

37:35.659 --> 37:37.850
since you returned from Navarre,

37:38.043 --> 37:41.063
something that upsets me greatly.

37:43.100 --> 37:46.435
The ones we love the most

37:46.470 --> 37:49.705
are the ones most likely to betray us.

38:09.160 --> 38:12.127
Landry, my son, forgive me.

38:12.163 --> 38:15.597
I believe I
have made a terrible mistake.

38:18.701 --> 38:19.835
What's happening?

38:19.870 --> 38:21.737
Your Holiness, there has been an attack.

38:21.772 --> 38:23.138
We must take you to safety.

38:23.174 --> 38:24.506
The Grail?

38:24.542 --> 38:27.108
I'm sorry, Your Holiness.
It's been taken.

38:33.517 --> 38:35.150
How many roads lead from here?

38:35.186 --> 38:36.852
Three, if you count the river.

38:36.887 --> 38:38.654
You and your men take to
the paths along the roads.

38:38.689 --> 38:41.156
Blanket the areas
heading from the Temple.

38:41.192 --> 38:43.019
I'll take the river.

38:44.061 --> 38:46.161
Aah!

38:46.197 --> 38:47.963
Aah!

38:47.998 --> 38:50.132
This poison tonic was
found in your room.

38:50.167 --> 38:51.834
Do you deny it?

38:51.869 --> 38:53.368
Aah!

38:53.404 --> 38:55.103
Who gave you the worm fern?

38:55.139 --> 38:56.305
Nobody.

38:59.013 --> 39:02.110
Who asked you to poison my child,

39:02.146 --> 39:04.179
to kill my unborn child?

39:04.215 --> 39:06.682
My child.

39:06.717 --> 39:09.151
My child!

39:09.186 --> 39:10.219
My son!

39:10.254 --> 39:12.721
Enough! Philip, stop it!

39:12.756 --> 39:15.457
Why should I?

39:15.492 --> 39:18.060
Because I asked her
to poison this child.

39:21.031 --> 39:22.264
Thank you.

39:27.705 --> 39:29.104
It's over.

39:29.139 --> 39:31.807
It has been for a long time, hasn't it?

39:36.881 --> 39:39.147
Come. Come.

39:39.183 --> 39:40.883
Isabella.

39:56.066 --> 39:59.234
My wife is very tired
after her long journey.

39:59.270 --> 40:02.971
Let's give her leave to
retire for the night.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.286
Quickly!

40:19.390 --> 40:22.190
Did you really think I was
going to let you leave?

40:24.094 --> 40:25.627
No!

40:25.663 --> 40:28.297
Did you think I would
ever let you leave?

40:28.332 --> 40:31.800
No. No. No!

40:33.704 --> 40:37.577
The Navarre, the Navarre...

40:38.809 --> 40:42.377
With your daughter and my child

40:42.413 --> 40:46.148
and your duplicitous face on the coins.

40:46.183 --> 40:47.749
"Quick, quick, pack your belongings!

40:47.785 --> 40:49.384
Tell no one!"

40:53.157 --> 40:54.623
Isabella, you foolish girl!

40:54.658 --> 40:56.491
What have you done?!

40:56.527 --> 40:58.593
Take her away.

40:58.629 --> 41:00.228
Isabella, no! Listen to me!

41:00.264 --> 41:02.464
Philip!

41:02.499 --> 41:05.000
Punishing me will not mend
what is already broken!

41:05.035 --> 41:07.336
Philip!

41:07.371 --> 41:08.837
Philip!

41:16.613 --> 41:18.513
Bastard.

41:18.549 --> 41:21.083
You always claimed to
understand my suffering.

41:23.620 --> 41:26.188
Let's see if that's true.

41:27.891 --> 41:29.825
Aah!

41:29.860 --> 41:31.193
Gah!

41:31.228 --> 41:33.415
Aaaaah!

41:33.831 --> 41:35.766
Aaaah!

41:36.834 --> 41:38.569
Aah!

41:39.169 --> 41:41.336
Aaaah!
