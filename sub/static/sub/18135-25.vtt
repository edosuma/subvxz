Why pay outrageous
space cabbie rates

01:47.207 --> 01:48.740
when my cosmic charter service

01:48.775 --> 01:50.809
can whisk you across
the galaxy

01:50.844 --> 01:52.511
for a fraction of the cost?

01:55.015 --> 01:57.415
It'll take more than some gal
with a stolen warp engine

to cut into this

01:59.886 --> 02:02.087

Mr. D, there's nothing on

03:54.167 --> 03:56.601
What about our Boom Tubes?

03:56.636 --> 03:58.703
What has he done to them?

03:58.738 --> 04:01.773
Somehow he placed a virus
within his Mother Box

04:01.808 --> 04:03.942
that has infected
our entire network.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.611
That's why you couldn't use
a Boom Tube to get here.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.214

some distance between me

I said don't wait.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.887
No. I was just...

04:48.922 --> 04:50.655
You defied me.

04:50.690 --> 04:53.191
Uh, got it.
No defying.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.526
I will overlook it,

04:54.561 --> 04:58.063

Yeah. And you do
what for him, again?

So, Apokolips,
I'll have you there yesterday.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.659
No hurry. In fact, I've been
meaning to make a visit

05:27.694 --> 05:29.928
to the acid lakes of Schlough.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.296
Let's stop there first.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.131
Whoa! The acid lakes?

05:33.166 --> 05:38.036
Isn't that where all the space

their victims?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.871
(CHUCKLING) Indeed.

05:43.209 --> 05:47.379
Oh, so that's why
the Green Lantern Corps
had the planet cordoned off.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.682
I don't care to alert
the Green Lanterns

05:50.717 --> 05:55.086
and distract them from
their noble duties, of course.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.022
Mmm, maybe now they'll shut
down a certainly deadly

05:58.057 --> 06:01.292

a couple parsecs over.

06:01.327 --> 06:04.729
Yeah, carnivorous plants there
give out a goo so corrosive,

06:04.764 --> 06:07.399
it would dissolve this cabin
in seconds. No trace.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.969
You've piqued my curiosity.
I'd like a look at the place.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.537
Oh, you don't want
to go there.
