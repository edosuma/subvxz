I'M SORRY, MA'AM,

00:16.807 --> 00:18.807
BUT I HAD A DREAM.

00:18.809 --> 00:21.059
I DREAMED THAT ONE DAY

ALL LAUNDRY WOULD BE
DONE TOGETHER --

IT WAS ONE OF HIS FRIENDS,

01:53.234 --> 01:56.004
IT TURNS OUT TO BE HIM,
AND LOOK WHO'S HERE NOW.

BECAUSE SOMEONE SPILLED SODA

OF THE AMPLIFIER.

03:52.653 --> 03:54.743

A MILLION TIMES

03:54.735 --> 03:56.355
DON'T TOUCH MY STUFF.

DID YOU SEE
WHICH ONE OF THEM DID IT?

03:58.359 --> 04:01.199
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY OF THE KIDS DO IT.

DON'T "HI" ME.
GET OVER HERE.

04:05.205 --> 04:07.455
DID YOU SPILL SODA
DOWN MY STEREO?

04:07.458 --> 04:09.668
NOT ME.
I DON'T DRINK SODA.

04:09.670 --> 04:12.870

04:24.475 --> 04:25.885
COME HERE.

04:25.886 --> 04:27.806

DOWN MY STEREO?

I CAN'T EVEN REACH
YOUR STUPID STEREO,

05:17.277 --> 05:18.937
IF YOU CAN'T TRUST
YOUR OWN CHILDREN,

05:18.939 --> 05:20.359
WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO TRUST?

05:20.361 --> 05:21.781
I AIN'T TRUSTED NOBODY

WHY DON'T WE GO PLAY
SOME BASKETBALL?

05:28.288 --> 05:30.948

AND YOU BE SKINS.

05:30.951 --> 05:33.331
DAD, IF WE'RE PLAYING
ONE ON ONE,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.513
I THINK WE COULD
TELL EACH OTHER APART.

05:35.506 --> 05:36.956
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:36.957 --> 05:39.167
WHY DON'T YOU DO
LIKE THIS FOR ME? WHOO.

06:08.328 --> 06:10.908
BUT HE'S NUMBER ONE
ON THE STEREO HIT LIST.

IS THAT REALLY NECESSARY?

06:16.707 --> 06:18.757
LET'S JUST
GET THE THING FIXED.

06:18.759 --> 06:21.169

06:21.171 --> 06:22.461
SEE, I JUST WANT

06:22.463 --> 06:24.893

"AHA!"

06:29.510 --> 06:31.470
THAT UNDER THE RULES
OF THE FAMILY MEETING,

06:31.472 --> 06:33.562
THE CULPRIT IS GOING
TO GET AMNESTY.

06:33.564 --> 06:36.904

WHERE WE CAN SAY ANYTHING.

06:48.288 --> 06:50.288
YOU CAN OPEN UP,
BE TOTALLY HONEST,

06:50.290 --> 06:51.790
AND NO REPERCUSSIONS.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.792
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

06:55.295 --> 06:57.495
NO MATTER WHAT
WE MAY HAVE DONE WRONG?

06:57.498 --> 06:59.538
NONE WHATSOEVER.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.263

WE CLEAR THE AIR.

07:07.427 --> 07:11.677
SAY YOU BROKE SOMETHING,
SOMETHING REALLY EXPENSIVE

07:11.682 --> 07:14.522
AND NEAR AND DEAR
TO SOMEBODY'S HEART.

07:14.515 --> 07:17.555
THIS IS THE PLACE
WHERE YOU PURGE YOURSELF.

07:17.558 --> 07:20.228
YOU GET IT OFF YOUR MIND --
THE CONFUSION

07:20.230 --> 07:22.400
AND THE GUILT AND SHAME
THAT YOU MUST BE FEELING

07:22.402 --> 07:24.952
INSIDE YOUR LITTLE SNEAKY HEART.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.615
HERE IS WHERE
YOU LET THAT OUT.

07:27.618 --> 07:30.198
SO ANYTHING?
ANYTHING.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.450
SO NO MATTER WHAT A PERSON MAY
OR MAY NOT HAVE DONE WRONG,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.543
THERE'S NO PUNISHMENT?
NO PUNISHMENT.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.126
SO WHAT IF YOU DID
SOMETHING REALLY --

07:37.127 --> 07:38.917
I DID IT! I DID IT!

07:38.919 --> 07:40.919
FOR GOD'S SAKES,
STOP TORTURING ME!

07:40.921 --> 07:42.251
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

07:42.252 --> 07:43.842
MICHAEL,
I WAS STANDING HERE, RIGHT?

07:43.844 --> 07:45.434
I WAS SINGING ALONG
WITH WHITNEY,

07:45.425 --> 07:47.425
AND WHEN WHITNEY HIT
THAT HIGH NOTE...♪ WHOO ♪

07:47.427 --> 07:48.847
AND I SAID...♪ WHOO ♪

07:48.849 --> 07:51.219

LIKE THAT, RIGHT?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.511
HOW COULD YOU?
MY BRAND-NEW BANG & OLUFSEN --

07:53.514 --> 07:55.604
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD

07:55.596 --> 07:58.056
I HAD TO WORK FOR THIS
AND PINCH TO SAVE MONEY

07:58.058 --> 07:59.478
TO BUY THIS THING?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.479
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO MORE WHITNEY IN THIS HOUSE.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.651
HER AND BOBBY ARE
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, OKAY?

08:03.654 --> 08:06.034
CISSY HOUSTON?
DON'T WANT HER IN HERE.

08:06.026 --> 08:09.026
I DON'T LIKE DIONNE EITHER.
NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT.

08:09.029 --> 08:11.029
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:11.031 --> 08:13.611
YOU TOLD ME
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO DID IT.

08:13.614 --> 08:15.624
NO, I DIDN'T. NO, I--
YES, YOU DID.

08:15.616 --> 08:17.456
NO, NO,
ACTUALLY, WHAT I SAID,

08:17.457 --> 08:19.617
I DIDN'T SEE
ANY OF THE KIDS DO IT.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.830
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO TWIST IT.

08:21.832 --> 08:23.502
YOU'RE TWISTING IT.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.683
MICHAEL --

08:24.675 --> 08:26.465
NO, NO, NO.
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?

08:26.466 --> 08:28.676
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY
DO THIS TO ME,

08:28.679 --> 08:30.469
KNOWING HOW I FELT
ABOUT THIS THING?

08:30.470 --> 08:33.390
NO REPERCUSSIONS.
NO REPERCUSSIONS.

08:39.600 --> 08:41.600
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.272
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.703
THIS IS JUST
MATERIAL THINGS...

08:45.696 --> 08:49.446
EXPENSIVE, REALLY NICE
MATERIAL THINGS

08:49.449 --> 08:51.649
THAT DON'T WORK NO MORE,

08:51.652 --> 08:53.572
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS
YOU FELT FREE ENOUGH

08:53.574 --> 08:56.504
TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.
RIGHT.

08:56.496 --> 08:59.076
AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE
HOW THE FAMILY MEETING WORKS.

08:59.079 --> 09:01.499
YOU SEE?
LOOK AT HER -- GUILT FREE.

09:01.501 --> 09:03.661
FEEL GOOD
ABOUT MYSELF.

09:03.664 --> 09:07.054
NOT A MARK ON HER.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.837
AND SHE'S ALMOST FORGIVEN.

09:10.841 --> 09:13.221
AHA!

09:15.596 --> 09:18.596
NOW SHE'S FORGIVEN.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.979
SO, BEFORE WE ADJOURN
THE MEETING,

09:20.981 --> 09:22.891
DOES ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE SOMETHING

09:22.893 --> 09:24.653
THEY WANT TO GET
OFF THEIR MIND?

09:24.645 --> 09:26.065
I DO.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.486
YES, CLAIRE?

09:27.487 --> 09:30.317
WELL, DAD, LAST FRIDAY
I MISSED CURFEW BY AN HOUR.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.240
OKAY, YOU'RE FORGIVEN.

09:32.242 --> 09:33.822
KADY?

09:33.824 --> 09:37.584
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

09:38.699 --> 09:40.999
THAT'S A LIE.

09:41.001 --> 09:43.961
AND YOU'RE FORGIVEN.

09:43.964 --> 09:45.344
JUNIOR?

09:45.335 --> 09:49.085
I GOT
A COUPLE OF TATTOOS.

09:57.678 --> 09:59.308
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU.

09:59.309 --> 10:01.809
NO, NO, NO REPERCUSSIONS.
NO REPERCUSSIONS.

10:11.031 --> 10:13.611
HELLO, JUNIOR.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.286
CAN I SLEEP OVER
AT MELANIE'S?

10:19.289 --> 10:21.329
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
NO, YOU CAN'T GO?

10:21.331 --> 10:23.291
FINE, THEN I'M NOT
TALKING TO YOU.

10:23.293 --> 10:24.673
YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

10:24.665 --> 10:28.125
GOOD. YOU WANT TO PLAY
THE INVISIBLE GAME?

10:28.128 --> 10:29.708
YOU'RE INVISIBLE, TOO.

10:29.710 --> 10:34.760
I HEAR SOMEONE,
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYONE.

10:34.755 --> 10:38.425
I SMELL SOMEONE,
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYONE,

10:38.428 --> 10:40.428
AND I'M GLAD
NO ONE'S AROUND

10:40.430 --> 10:42.640
'CAUSE I GOT
THIS GOOD CHOCOLATE BAR

10:42.642 --> 10:44.642
THAT I'M GOING TO EAT
ALL BY MYSELF

10:44.644 --> 10:47.444
WITH ALL OF THESE NUTS
AND CARAMEL IN IT.

10:47.437 --> 10:50.897
MMM-MMM!

10:50.901 --> 10:52.611
IT SURE IS GOOD

10:52.612 --> 10:57.242
WHEN THERE'S
NO ONE ELSE AROUND.

10:57.237 --> 11:00.577
SO? I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ANY CHOCOLATE ANYWAYS.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.540
IT GIVES ME THE RUNS.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.496
HEY, RODMAN,

11:07.497 --> 11:10.287
WHERE'S YOUR NOSE RING
AND YOUR DRESS?

11:10.290 --> 11:13.050
COME ON, DAD, I THOUGHT
WE LEFT THIS AT THE MEETING.

11:13.053 --> 11:14.673
THIS AIN'T NO
REPERCUSSIONS.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.064
I'M JUST SAYING HEY,

11:16.056 --> 11:18.676
HI TO THE DUMB GUY
THAT GOT THE TATTOOS.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.298
WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE
THIS ARTWORK

11:21.301 --> 11:24.101
YOU'VE DECIDED
TO PUT ON YOUR BODY?

11:24.104 --> 11:25.234
WOW.

11:25.225 --> 11:26.435
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.146
YEAH, THAT'S STUPID.

11:28.148 --> 11:30.768
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO SEE
THE FUTURE, SON.

11:30.771 --> 11:31.941
IN ABOUT 20 YEARS,

11:31.942 --> 11:33.942
THAT CUTE LITTLE HEART
IS GOING TO LOOK

11:33.944 --> 11:36.784
LIKE A SUN-DRIED TOMATO.

11:36.777 --> 11:38.777
AND WHAT'S THE REST
OF THE FOOLISHNESS?

11:38.779 --> 11:41.659
THAT'S "KNOWLEDGE"
IN JAPANESE.

11:41.661 --> 11:43.451
DO YOU SPEAK JAPANESE?

11:43.453 --> 11:44.663
NO.

11:44.664 --> 11:45.754
DO YOU READ JAPANESE?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.746
NO.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.708
THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT DOESN'T SAY

11:49.709 --> 11:52.129
"SPICY TUNA ROLL"?

11:52.132 --> 11:54.632
DAD, THIS IS STARTING
TO SOUND NEGATIVE.

11:54.634 --> 11:56.264
IT'S NOT NEGATIVE.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU

11:56.256 --> 11:57.966
I THINK THAT
YOUR TATTOOS ARE STUPID.

11:57.968 --> 11:59.598
I CAN SAY THAT, RIGHT?

11:59.599 --> 12:00.759
ABSOLUTELY.
THEY ARE STUPID.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.391
VERY, VERY STUPID,

12:02.392 --> 12:04.812
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT REALLY GOT ME UPSET

12:04.805 --> 12:07.185
IS THE FACT THAT
YOU LOOKED US IN THE EYE

12:07.187 --> 12:09.937
AND YOU SAID,
"I DON'T HAVE A TATTOO."

12:09.940 --> 12:12.560
NO, I LOOKED MOM
IN THE EYE AND SAID NO,

12:12.562 --> 12:13.942
AND AS YOU JUST SAW,

12:13.944 --> 12:18.624
I DON'T HAVEATATTOO,
I HAVE TWO TATTOOS.

12:18.618 --> 12:22.448
THANK YOU,
MR. BILL CLINTON.

12:29.079 --> 12:32.369
HA HA HA!

12:32.372 --> 12:34.842
BOY, THIS CARTOON
SURE IS FUNNY.

12:34.835 --> 12:37.635
HA HA HA!
THIS IS THE ONE WHERE

12:37.637 --> 12:40.717
SCROOGE McDUCK GOT HIS TAIL
CAUGHT IN THE MONEY BIN.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.090
WHOO-HOO-HOO!
HE'S HILARIOUS!

12:43.093 --> 12:44.723
HA HA HA!

12:44.724 --> 12:46.944
BABY, WHY DON'T YOU
WATCH SOME CARTOONS

12:46.937 --> 12:48.557
WITH YOUR DADDY?

12:48.558 --> 12:50.598
I DON'T HAVE A DADDY.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.100
OHH.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.992
BOY, I SURE WISH
I HAD SOMEONE TO SIT HERE

12:54.985 --> 12:57.605
AND WATCH THIS FUNNY CARTOON
WITH ME,

12:57.607 --> 13:00.567
BUT I DON'T SEE ANYBODY AROUND

13:00.570 --> 13:04.160
EXCEPT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE,
AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE CARTOONS.

13:04.164 --> 13:06.174
I USED TO HAVE A FRIEND,

13:06.166 --> 13:09.286
BUT SHE'S INVISIBLE NOW.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.709
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT
TO WATCH SCROOGE McDUCK.

13:12.712 --> 13:15.552
YOU WANT TO WATCH
SCROOGE McDUCK WITH ME?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.545
COME ON.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.180
HEY, JAY,

13:22.182 --> 13:24.802
THANKS FOR WATCHING
THE CARTOON WITH ME.

13:24.804 --> 13:27.434
I WAS ALL ALONE.

13:27.427 --> 13:29.637
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

13:29.639 --> 13:31.729
I'M GOING
TO MAKE SOME POPCORN

13:31.731 --> 13:33.481
FOR MY TWO FAVORITE PEOPLE.

13:33.483 --> 13:34.903
Both: TWO?

13:34.895 --> 13:35.855
HMM.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.316
HMM.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.319
BOY, I'M SURE GLAD
I'M HERE ALL BY MYSELF.

13:42.322 --> 13:46.162
I GOT TO LAUNCH
AN AIR BISCUIT.

13:48.248 --> 13:50.868
EWW!

13:55.165 --> 13:57.375
OKAY, JUNIOR,
LET ME SEE THEM.

13:57.377 --> 13:58.757
ARE YOU SURE?

13:58.758 --> 14:00.958
I'M SURE I'M NOT GOING
TO LIKE THEM,

14:00.961 --> 14:02.551
BUT I MIGHT AS WELL
GET USED TO THEM.

14:02.552 --> 14:04.932
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY, REALLY
MAKES ME MAD ABOUT ALL THIS?

14:04.925 --> 14:06.555
I GAVE BIRTH TO YOU,

14:06.556 --> 14:08.176
AND IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE REWRITING MY WORK.

14:08.178 --> 14:09.968
I'M REALLY POSITIVE
THAT...

14:09.970 --> 14:11.810
DOES THAT SAY "MOM"?

14:11.811 --> 14:14.941
UH-HUH.

14:14.935 --> 14:16.395
WHAT DOES THIS ONE SAY?

14:16.396 --> 14:19.066
UH, THAT SAYS "MOM"
IN JAPANESE.

14:19.069 --> 14:24.569
OH, BABY.
THAT'S SWEET.

14:24.574 --> 14:26.794
AHA!

14:26.786 --> 14:28.286
HOLD IT UP.

14:28.288 --> 14:29.578
WHAT?

14:29.579 --> 14:31.579
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THAT.

14:31.581 --> 14:34.251
THERE'S 1/16 OF AN INCH
LEFT OF MILK,

14:34.254 --> 14:36.464
AND YOU PUT IT BACK
IN THE REFRIGERATOR?

14:36.456 --> 14:38.256
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.458
THIS IS THE MOST SELFISH THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

14:40.460 --> 14:41.840
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO
"GOT MILK"

14:41.841 --> 14:44.301
WHEN WE DON'T GOT MILK?

14:44.304 --> 14:45.934
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE GROUNDED.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.096
YOU'RE GROUNDED.
THIS IS SELFISH.

14:48.098 --> 14:49.718
I WANT YOU TO GO
UP IN YOUR ROOM,

14:49.719 --> 14:51.179
TAKE EVERYTHING THAT LOOKS
LIKE IT COULD BE FUN,

14:51.181 --> 14:52.811
AND PUT IT IN THE GARAGE.

14:52.812 --> 14:54.602
I DON'T WANT NOTHING
IN YOUR ROOM

14:54.604 --> 14:57.194
EXCEPT BOOKS AND A BED.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:57.187 --> 15:00.727
I'M STILL NOT SURE
ABOUT THE BED.

15:00.730 --> 15:04.320
LET'S GO.

15:04.324 --> 15:09.374
TATTOOS I COULD TAKE,
BUT THIS...

15:09.369 --> 15:11.989
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

15:11.992 --> 15:15.342
THAT IS THE LOWEST THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

15:15.335 --> 15:17.535
YEAH, SEE HOW LOW
THAT IS?

15:17.537 --> 15:19.457
WHAT IF KADY WAS CHOKING

15:19.459 --> 15:21.539
ON A PIECE OF CANDY
OR SOMETHING,

15:21.541 --> 15:22.921
HAPPENED TO COME IN --

15:22.922 --> 15:25.812
[ Coughs ]
NOTHING, STILL CHOKING.

15:25.805 --> 15:28.425
NOT THAT, MICHAEL --
YOU.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.348
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, ME?

15:30.350 --> 15:31.970
YOU AGREED THAT
YOU WOULDN'T PUNISH HIM

15:31.972 --> 15:34.182
FOR THE TATTOOS
AND NOW YOU'RE DOING IT.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.824
I DIDN'T PUNISH HIM
FOR THE TATTOOS.

15:35.815 --> 15:37.185
I PUNISHED HIM
FOR THE MILK --

15:37.187 --> 15:40.017
THIS SELFISH ACT OF MILKING
THIS MILKLESS HOUSE.

15:40.020 --> 15:41.900
YOU'RE BEING
A HYPOCRITE, MICHAEL.

15:41.901 --> 15:44.271
I'M NOT BEING A HYPOCRITE.
I'M NOT BEING -- I'M BEING --

15:44.274 --> 15:47.074
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YEAH, I'M BEING A HYPOCRITE,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.947
AND WHEN YOU'RE A PARENT,
YOU GOT TO BE A HYPOCRITE.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.029
THAT'S PART OF THE JOB.

15:52.032 --> 15:53.832
THAT'S NOT HOW
WE'VE RUN THIS HOUSEHOLD.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.843
WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A DEMOCRACY.

15:55.835 --> 15:57.785
YEAH, WELL,
THAT WENT OUT THE WINDOW

15:57.787 --> 15:59.167
WITH THE TATTOOS.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.919
THAT WAS THE FIRST SHOT FIRED
IN THE TEENAGE REBELLION.

16:01.921 --> 16:03.921
FROM NOW ON,
IT'S A DICTATORSHIP,

16:03.923 --> 16:07.013
AND I'M DIC.

16:09.679 --> 16:12.469
LOOK IN THIS MIRROR
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

16:12.472 --> 16:16.062
A BEAUTIFUL
BALD-HEADED BLACK MAN,

16:16.056 --> 16:17.646
A LITTLE ANGRY.

16:17.647 --> 16:20.977
AND WHAT DOES THIS BEAUTIFUL
BALD-HEADED BLACK MAN,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.980
A LITTLE ANGRY,
HAVE IN HIS EAR?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.033
A BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND

16:26.026 --> 16:30.026
THAT COULD BE
A LITTLE BIGGER.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.820
AND WHEN DID YOU
GET THAT DONE?

16:32.822 --> 16:34.912
WHEN I WAS 17.

16:34.914 --> 16:37.334
UH-HUH, AND HOW DID
YOUR FATHER FEEL ABOUT IT?

16:37.327 --> 16:39.077
HEY, LOOK, THIS AIN'T
ABOUT MY FATHER,

16:39.079 --> 16:41.079
BECAUSE MY FATHER
KICKED MY BEHIND.

16:41.081 --> 16:43.081
THERE WAS NO AMNESTY, OKAY?

16:43.083 --> 16:45.133
THERE WERE REPERCUSSIONS,

16:45.125 --> 16:47.715
WHICH LED TO REVERBERATIONS,

16:47.717 --> 16:52.007
WHICH REQUIRED RECUPERATION.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.734
BABY, MY POINT IS
YOU REBELLED, TOO.

16:56.726 --> 16:58.936
TRY TO HAVE
A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING.

16:58.938 --> 17:01.228
DO YOU WANT TO DO THINGS
THE WAY YOUR FATHER DID IT

17:01.231 --> 17:03.901
OR DO YOU WANT TO TRY
TO HANDLE THIS

17:03.903 --> 17:05.323
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY?

17:05.315 --> 17:07.105
LOOK AT THE MILK, THOUGH.

17:07.107 --> 17:09.527
BABY.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.536
PLUG THAT BACK IN.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.657
WHAT?

17:19.659 --> 17:21.039
YOU CAN HAVE
YOUR STUFF BACK.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.920
IT'S A GESTURE
OF GOOD WILL.

17:22.922 --> 17:24.872
WELL, THAT WHOLE MILK THING
WAS PRETTY BOGUS, DAD.

17:24.874 --> 17:26.554
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT WAS BOGUS,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.336
AND I APOLOGIZE.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.378
GOOD.

17:29.379 --> 17:31.089
YOU ACCEPT MY APOLOGY?

17:31.091 --> 17:32.261
YES.

17:32.262 --> 17:34.722
GOOD,
'CAUSE I'M UNAPOLOGIZING.

17:34.724 --> 17:36.144
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:36.136 --> 17:38.676
SIT DOWN.
I'M TAKING IT BACK.

17:38.678 --> 17:41.808
SEE, YOU DESTROYED
THE TRUST, JUNIOR.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.811
OKAY? FORGET
ABOUT THE TATTOOS.

17:44.814 --> 17:47.824
FORGET ABOUT AMNESTY
OR THE FAMILY MEETING.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.237
YOU LIED TO ME,

17:49.239 --> 17:51.189
AND THAT
JUST DOESN'T GO AWAY.

17:51.191 --> 17:53.071
I KNOW YOU THINK
I MESSED UP, DAD,

17:53.072 --> 17:55.292
BUT I DID THIS
TO FEEL LIKE MY OWN PERSON.

17:55.285 --> 17:57.865
I THINK THEY'RE COOL,
AND THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS

17:57.867 --> 18:00.867
IT'S MY BODY, AND I CAN DO
WHAT I WANT WITH IT.

18:00.870 --> 18:03.370
NO, AS LONG AS YOUR BODY
IS IN MY HOUSE,

18:03.373 --> 18:06.213
YOUR BODY HAS TO ABIDE
BY MY RULES.

18:06.206 --> 18:08.206
I DIDN'T VIOLATE
ANY RULES, DAD.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.838
YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT NOT GETTING A TATTOO.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.210
YEAH, AND I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING ABOUT OWNING A GUN

18:13.213 --> 18:16.433
OR EATING FIRE
OR PEEING IN THE TOASTER.

18:16.426 --> 18:19.426
THIS IS ABOUT PRINCIPLE.
OKAY?

18:19.429 --> 18:21.269
IF YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS ALL RIGHT,

18:21.271 --> 18:23.431
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LIED TO ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:23.433 --> 18:26.533
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD,

18:26.526 --> 18:28.226
AND I'M SORRY I LIED,

18:28.228 --> 18:30.858
BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE FACT THAT I'M GROWING UP.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.860
YOU'VE GOT TO
LOOSEN THE REINS.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.532
LOOK,
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE TALL

18:34.534 --> 18:36.544
DON'T MEAN
YOU'RE GROWN UP.

18:36.536 --> 18:39.286
IT JUST MAKES YOU
A TALL KID.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.499
TRUST IS SOMETHING
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EARN.

18:41.501 --> 18:43.241
THAT'S HOW YOU GET FREEDOM.

18:43.243 --> 18:45.593
APPARENTLY, WE'RE NOT GOING
TO SETTLE THIS.

18:45.585 --> 18:47.585
SO WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?

18:47.587 --> 18:50.747
I GUESS WE HAVE TO MEET
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE,

18:50.750 --> 18:52.750
TRY TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

18:52.752 --> 18:55.132
HOW?

18:55.134 --> 18:58.144
WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN.
START FROM SCRATCH.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.717
DEAL?

18:59.719 --> 19:01.179
DEAL.

19:01.181 --> 19:04.351
COME HERE.

19:07.357 --> 19:09.977
I AIN'T READY
TO LET GO YET.

19:09.979 --> 19:14.359
DO YOU MEAN THAT
LITERALLY OR FIGURATIVELY?

19:14.364 --> 19:16.704
BOTH.

19:16.696 --> 19:19.406
EVENTUALLY,
WE'LL BOTH STARVE.

19:22.492 --> 19:25.292
LET'S GO GET
SOME COOKIES AND...

19:25.285 --> 19:27.915
WATER.

19:46.065 --> 19:49.475
KADY, YOUR DADDY IS SO MEAN.

19:49.479 --> 19:52.479
WHY WON'T HE LET YOU
COME OVER TO MY HOUSE?

19:52.482 --> 19:56.492
'CAUSE HE'S A MEAN
BALD-HEADED GRINCH,

19:56.486 --> 20:00.576
AND HE'S INVISIBLE.

20:00.580 --> 20:05.830
GIRL, THERE'S NO MILK
IN THAT REFRIGERATOR.

20:05.825 --> 20:07.825
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:07.827 --> 20:11.827
I SAID YOUR BROTHER
DRANK ALL THE MILK.

20:11.831 --> 20:14.251
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY DADDY?

20:14.254 --> 20:16.644
IS HE TALL AND HANDSOME?

20:16.636 --> 20:20.796
HE'S TALL.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.180
WHOO! I JUST SAW'D HIM!
I JUST SAW'D HIM!

20:24.183 --> 20:26.443
HE'S FINE, TOO.

20:26.436 --> 20:28.436
WOULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR?

20:28.438 --> 20:31.228
ASK HIM IF MELANIE
CAN COME TO MY HOUSE

20:31.230 --> 20:32.850
FOR A SLEEPOVER.

20:32.852 --> 20:37.412
EXCUSE ME,
TALL, BALD, AND HANDSOME.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.987
CAN I COME OVER
TO KADY'S HOUSE

20:39.989 --> 20:41.569
FOR A SLEEPOVER?

20:41.571 --> 20:45.161
MAYBE, BUT FOR A PRICE.

20:45.164 --> 20:47.874
I WANT A HUG AND KISS
FROM KADY.

20:47.867 --> 20:51.867
GIRL...

20:51.871 --> 20:55.721
HE SAID HE WANTS
SOME SUGARS FROM YOU

20:55.715 --> 20:57.545
BEFORE HE DO ANYTHING.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.547
I HEARD HIM, SILLY.
