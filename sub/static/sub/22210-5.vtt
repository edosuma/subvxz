00:02.419 --> 00:06.208
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.381 --> 00:09.249
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.461
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:15.171
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.557 --> 00:17.298
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:20.139
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:23.138
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats</i>

00:23.607 --> 00:25.894
<i>and I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.109 --> 00:28.442
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.613 --> 00:31.525
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.615 --> 00:33.823
Each of these heat scans
indicates a human body.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.992
Twelve markers, twelve metas.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.161
Why would anyone want to create metas?

00:38.789 --> 00:39.825
What's happened to me?

00:39.915 --> 00:41.201
Clearly, this guy is a bus meta.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.281
You can stretch these cells...

00:42.376 --> 00:43.742
- Like Silly Putty.
- ...like Silly Putty.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.825
I'm Silly Putty?

00:44.920 --> 00:46.536
Let my team and I train you.

00:46.630 --> 00:48.371
What made you look into Mayor Bellows?

00:48.465 --> 00:50.707
It was a client. Last name, DeVoe.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.463
You do what Amunet says,
for as long as she tells you.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.133
Tell Amunet I'm done.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.056
Joe, I'm pregnant.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.144
Hey, you guys wanna see
something really cool?

01:07.359 --> 01:09.976
Um... Sure, go for it.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.311
Stretch, Ralph.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.645
Stretch.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.486
- That is pretty cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.278
Okay, look, are you sure
we can't find this DeVoe guy?

01:20.372 --> 01:22.113
I mean, we were warned.
We had a heads-up

01:22.207 --> 01:25.666
that someday someone named DeVoe
would be one of my greatest foes.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.958
The other thing to think about is,
do you know how many people there are,

01:29.089 --> 01:31.581
- in this state alone, with the name DeVoe?
- No.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.917
Thousands. And we still don't
have an age.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.964
<i>Unless one of your
greatest foes is</i>

01:36.221 --> 01:39.635
the three-month-old William DeVoe
who lives four blocks from here.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.970
I don't think
one of my greatest enemies is a baby.

01:42.144 --> 01:43.976
- Evil killer baby.
- It could happen.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.344
You're right.

01:45.897 --> 01:46.887
Hey.

01:46.982 --> 01:48.223
- Felicity.
- Hey.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.186
- How did you get in here?
- I literally walked in here.

01:52.279 --> 01:56.364
You have no security, you have no
alarms, you have nothing on your door.

01:56.450 --> 01:59.033
You guys might wanna consider something.
Anything, at all.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.111
- You came prepared.
- Team Arrow to Team Bride.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.866
You know, I'm very excited
for that bachelorette party.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.791
Getting inebriated with same genders
to celebrate an archaic institution?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.116
Priceless.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.953
I mean, you only get married once, so...

02:10.172 --> 02:13.415
Well, actually, pretty much
everyone gets divorced these days.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.465
Fifty-five percent to be exact.
I mean, that's just statistics.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.010
But not... Not you and Iris.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.133
That would just...
That would never happen to you guys.

02:21.767 --> 02:22.883
<i>Whose feet are those?</i>

02:22.976 --> 02:24.592
That's Ralph Dibny.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.476
I'm gonna go meet up with the ladies.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.850
That...

02:45.123 --> 02:47.035
Well, here you are. Okay.

02:47.125 --> 02:51.119
Are you ready for the ladies' night
to end all ladies' nights?

02:51.213 --> 02:55.503
And by that she means a quiet, low-key
dinner at a very classy restaurant.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.218
Yeah. That's exactly what I mean.
Super low-key, super quiet.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.886
Do you want a pink or
a blue feather boa?

03:00.972 --> 03:03.510
Actually, Iris, if it's okay,
I don't think I'm gonna make it tonight.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.057
I'm just not feeling up to it.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.975
What? Are you feeling okay?

03:07.187 --> 03:08.598
No, I'm fine. I just...

03:09.064 --> 03:10.851
Sometimes life catches up
with you, you know?

03:11.024 --> 03:12.140
That's 'cause you're not
wearing a tiara.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.475
Put on the tiara,
everything'll change... Oh!

03:13.735 --> 03:15.772
- Wearing a tiara. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.987
Caitlin, please. Come on,
we work together every day.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.360
We never get to do a dinner,
just us girls. You have to come.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.282
She's right. Just one dinner. Please.

03:23.578 --> 03:24.614
Wouldn't miss it.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.620
This is so insane. I can't believe
you're gonna be a mom again.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.000
I know. Well, you've always

03:35.090 --> 03:36.297
wanted a sibling.

03:36.383 --> 03:39.000
And seven <i>Dr. Who's</i> later,
you totally came through.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.136
- You're a <i>Dr. Who</i> fan, Joanie?
- Well, ever since he became a lady, I am.

03:42.264 --> 03:43.505
Hashtag feminism.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.641
Bachelor party! Girls, get out.

03:47.936 --> 03:48.926
<i>Oh, that's our cue.</i>

03:50.564 --> 03:52.146
Hey, Barry, congrats on getting hitched.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.981
Thank you.
I didn't realize you were in town.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.228
Well, I just stopped by for the weekend.

03:55.318 --> 03:57.230
- Awesome. Good to see you.
- You too.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.361
Have a great time. Don't get too crazy.
No drinking.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.860
Mmm-mmm.
No, Iris promised me a totally chill night

04:04.953 --> 04:06.865
that even my pregnant booty can handle.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.365
You should come with us, sweetie.
You know, I'm sure Iris wouldn't mind.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.709
Uh, no, it's okay. I actually have plans.
But I will drop you off.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.546
- Okay. Have fun. Later, guys.
- Bye.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.375
Okay. I'll get the lights.
Harry'll get the brandy.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.965
Hey, Harry, before you pour the brandy,
make sure you warm the glasses.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.388
- What?
- For real?

04:25.724 --> 04:26.714
It's cool.

04:28.643 --> 04:29.633
<i>Okay.</i>

04:30.562 --> 04:31.552
Barry Allen,

04:32.063 --> 04:33.599
are you ready to have your mind blown?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.265
<i>Meet Barry Allen.</i>

04:35.609 --> 04:37.191
<i>Before he met Iris West,</i>

04:37.402 --> 04:40.816
<i>before he became an inter-dimensional
time-traveling speedster,</i>

04:41.031 --> 04:44.490
he was an adorable baby
boy with Ewok-level chub.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.280
<i>Oh, those cheeks!</i>

04:47.370 --> 04:49.487
Cisco, this is great,
but where did you get these videos?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.072
Hey, man, I'm a ninja. Watch this part.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.958
Ah, I forgot that you two got married!

04:57.964 --> 04:59.171
You two were so young.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.500
Damn, I was so young.

05:02.844 --> 05:03.834
Mmm-hmm.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.178
Gentlemen, I have arrived.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.554
- Ralph.
- Dibny.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.139
Wasn't expecting you.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.516
You said, "See you later."

05:14.606 --> 05:16.472
I assumed this was a superhero hangout

05:16.566 --> 05:18.979
and this was a test for my
highly-attuned detective abilities

05:19.069 --> 05:21.561
which, for the record, nailed it.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.235
- Okay, or...
- You weren't invited.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.820
- Wow, this house is...
- Bitching?

05:26.910 --> 05:29.448
No. Small. It looks much bigger
from the street.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.037
- What's all this crap?
- This is my bachelor party.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.451
Oh, dear God. You're serious.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.912
This weiner fest is your bachelor party.

05:39.172 --> 05:43.086
This weiner fest is about to indulge
in some very fine cigars

05:43.301 --> 05:45.258
and a very nice steak dinner at The Oak.

05:45.345 --> 05:49.009
Okay! Stop. You're going to pay
$50 for a steak dinner?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.808
I know a place where you get
all-you-can-eat steak

05:52.894 --> 05:55.102
and chicken for $4.99.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.979
And they even throw in napkins.

05:57.899 --> 06:01.063
- Come on, ladies.
- No, really, Ralph.

06:01.152 --> 06:03.269
- We're gonna stay here. We're gonna...
- No, Slim Jim.

06:03.613 --> 06:05.980
I insist. You can thank me later.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.442
- Hey, that was meant to be enjoyed!
- I enjoyed it.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.538
Cisco, don't worry. Where we're going,
the drinks flow freely and the view is...

06:13.999 --> 06:15.581
Oh! Spectacular.

06:23.842 --> 06:26.630
- So fancy.
- Yeah, a toast,

06:26.720 --> 06:28.086
to the future Mrs. Allen.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.882
- West-Allen.
- West-Allen.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.968
Although your life with Barry
may be fast-paced,

06:32.058 --> 06:34.425
I hope you guys take the time
to enjoy the special moments.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.727
Thank you, guys, for coming.
It really means a lot.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.224
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

06:38.857 --> 06:41.224
Well, all right. Who wants my champagne?

06:41.401 --> 06:43.438
Craziest thing I get to do tonight
is order two desserts.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.068
- I'll take it.
- That's right.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.817
Iris told me you're pregnant.
How's that going?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.356
<i>Yeah. It's good.</i>

06:48.533 --> 06:52.743
I mean, it wasn't exactly part of my plan.
But, I just could not be happier.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.786
I know exactly what you mean.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.327
<i>Oh, yeah. How is everything
with Oliver and William?</i>

06:57.667 --> 06:58.703
It's an adjustment...

07:02.881 --> 07:05.339
Do I hear wedding bells ringing
in your future?

07:05.425 --> 07:08.008
Oh, no, the last time we did anything
that resembled a wedding,

07:08.094 --> 07:09.676
Oliver got shot with an arrow. So...

07:11.640 --> 07:14.383
- Uh, did you girls order a stripper?
- Why didn't you tell me?

07:14.476 --> 07:16.012
- I would've brought all my singles.
- No, I...

07:17.395 --> 07:19.227
Girl, you into some freaky stuff.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.812
Amunet wants you.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.517
Uh... Caitlin, do you know him?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.896
- You need to come with me.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.275
Please tell me that
this is just part of his act?

07:33.370 --> 07:35.157
Yeah, if it is, it's taking too long.
Take it off.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.876
Gross! I meant take off your pants,
not your eye.

07:45.924 --> 07:46.914
Oh, my God!

08:00.647 --> 08:02.229
Stay back, baby mama, we got this.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.862
Holy...

08:19.040 --> 08:20.030
Please don't do this.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.166
It didn't have to be this way.

08:25.964 --> 08:26.954
What?

08:32.011 --> 08:33.844
I was hoping to see you again.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.347
Really? So I could give you another scar?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.478
Ugh! I hate pink.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.831
Doesn't it just take your breath away?

09:07.797 --> 09:10.255
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
that is Jade.</i>

09:10.341 --> 09:12.424
Gentleman, I welcome you
to The Golden Booty.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.006
There ain't nothing golden
about any of this.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.966
I came through for you, right man?
What do you think?

09:17.849 --> 09:20.387
I think I should have
brought some hand sanitizers.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.676
I always come prepared.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.303
Yes!

09:24.397 --> 09:26.138
Ralph, this isn't really my speed.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.894
Speed jokes?
You're better than that, Allen.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.941
- I wasn't...
- Hey, Ralphy.

09:30.653 --> 09:33.316
Uh, Disney, you're a regular
in this joint?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.694
So much more than that.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.277
The girls might not be bottomless,

09:39.370 --> 09:42.113
but for yours truly,
the french fries always are.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.080
Golden Booty policy,

09:44.417 --> 09:48.081
you know, out of respect for the ladies,
no touching, no pictures, no video,

09:49.005 --> 09:50.621
- and no cell phones.
- What?

09:50.757 --> 09:52.464
<i>Next, on the main stage...</i>

09:54.260 --> 09:55.250
I need a drink.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.549
God, I wish I could have a drink.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.131
Bro, you really think
I'd let you down like that?

10:01.226 --> 10:02.262
Your special concoction.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.598
Guaranteed to give you
that gentle pleasant buzz,

10:05.772 --> 10:07.513
all night long.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.851
What if we need the Flash?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.979
I volunteer to be designated superhero.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.853
Go for it, Barry, you deserve it.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.063
Oh!

10:16.282 --> 10:18.239
- To Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.001
- They're not picking up.
- What the hell just happened?

10:30.171 --> 10:31.662
Who was that Medusa man?

10:31.756 --> 10:33.543
You know that is not
a Cisco-approved name.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.044
Don't worry about who that was.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.346
Caitlin's taste in clothes is matched
only by her taste in men.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.421
Both terrible.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.891
Wait. How are you, you?
I thought Caitlin was cured.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.971
Caitlin shouldn't be
keeping secrets from her friend.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.310
You are friends, right?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.484
Yeah. Of course we are.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.736
Your "friend"
was going out-of-town tonight.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.146
What? Why?

10:57.240 --> 10:59.732
Because she got herself into
something she couldn't handle.

10:59.909 --> 11:00.990
Where are you going?

11:01.244 --> 11:03.110
To find Norvock's boss. And to kill her.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.745
And you need a change of clothes
for that, because...

11:06.291 --> 11:09.284
Whoa! Whoa! Okay, apparently someone
doesn't have boundary issues.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.661
Okay girls,
can I talk to you in the Cortex?

11:12.255 --> 11:13.666
Can we take it back for a minute?

11:13.882 --> 11:16.465
Since when did her superpowers
make her a super villain?

11:16.718 --> 11:18.004
She's not a villain, okay?

11:18.261 --> 11:19.923
I remember being kidnapped
by her last year.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.049
- What?
- Okay, yes, but that,

11:21.139 --> 11:23.096
is because she was being manipulated
by Savitar.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.345
And in the end, we wouldn't have been
able to stop him without her.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.974
Look, I know that
there is some good in there.

11:29.063 --> 11:32.682
I get it. Technically, Caitlin is
underneath all of that somewhere

11:32.775 --> 11:34.858
but she is still dangerous.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.981
And she is also our friend, okay?

11:37.071 --> 11:38.937
I'm not just gonna abandon our teammate.

11:39.324 --> 11:41.361
Fine. I'm coming with you.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.238
No, Cecile, you're pregnant.

11:43.328 --> 11:46.287
And your father will kill me if you get
killed at your own bachelorette party.

11:46.372 --> 11:48.238
That is some crazy logic
and that means I'm in, too.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.121
- Oh, great, happy bachelorette.
- What are you all talking about?

11:51.294 --> 11:54.378
Oh, nothing. You know, just talking
about how cool it is to kill people.

11:54.464 --> 11:55.671
And such. No pun intended.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.291
It's been real, ladies.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.299
I'm gonna use the S.T.A.R. Labs
satellite to track her cold signature.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.764
Great, I'm going to try
and call for back-up again.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.967
And I'll remember that it's Caitlin
under there.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.646
- You gotta stop doing that.
- I'm just getting change for a five.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.850
What? Did you think I was stealing?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.858
It's not about your sticky fingers, Ralph,

12:19.948 --> 12:22.315
it's about your stretchy arm
outwardly displayed.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.196
Oh, so I should be more like
Captain Discreet over there?

12:25.286 --> 12:26.868
I'm the Flash!

12:29.999 --> 12:32.491
I may have slightly miscalculated
his bachelor elixir.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.575
I got this one.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.827
That's good stuff.

12:35.922 --> 12:39.836
- Hey buddy, how are you feeling?
- Hey. I feel good.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.001
Oh, you're gonna need to walk this off.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.929
Or run it off! Because I'm the Flash!

12:46.683 --> 12:48.549
Let's get you back to the table.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.772
Barry, what did you just do?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.900
I just went and got peanuts from the bar.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.440
- You didn't even move.
- Or did I?

13:01.656 --> 13:03.192
- Drink up. So I was talking to...
- I'm good.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.819
It's cranberry juice, buttercup.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.196
So I was talking to Charity,
not her real name,

13:07.287 --> 13:10.655
she tells me that the dancers here
make more in a month than an average...

13:10.748 --> 13:13.616
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Less talky, more dancy!

13:13.918 --> 13:15.534
<i>...dancer, it's Jasmine.</i>

13:22.552 --> 13:23.542
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:30.182
Oh, hell no.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.217
Hey, she looks like Cecile's daughter!

13:33.980 --> 13:35.266
Oh!

13:49.454 --> 13:53.118
I'm sorry. I thought touching without
permission is what you wanted.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.379
I'd let me pass, unless you want to know

14:01.466 --> 14:04.174
what it feels like when
the liquid in your eyeballs crystallizes.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.003
<i>Darling, you're here! Let her in.</i>

14:08.598 --> 14:10.885
<i>Let her in. Let her in.</i>

14:12.268 --> 14:16.262
Amunet, next time
you want to talk, come yourself.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.348
Don't send that eye-hole to attack me.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.307
Did you start a fight?

14:21.235 --> 14:24.979
Honestly, Norvock, it's why
you're my third favorite henchman.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.235
I mean, what do I always say?

14:27.658 --> 14:29.524
"Never start a fight you can't finish."

14:29.827 --> 14:30.908
Hmm?

14:32.163 --> 14:35.201
And that, my dear,
is why you're my favorite.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.626
- You listen.
- Well, apparently you don't.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.541
- I'm out, Amunet.
- "Out"?

14:42.298 --> 14:43.459
Out of what?

14:44.008 --> 14:46.591
Out of options? Out of your mind?

14:46.844 --> 14:50.554
Out of the closet? There's just so many
outs for the lady in blue.

14:50.932 --> 14:52.139
You're asking me to dance?

14:52.308 --> 14:55.142
You should know by now
I don't "ask" for anything.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.890
I tell and I take.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.765
Now, come along.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.901
I want to show you something
that could make us both very rich.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.034
Do you think they're gonna able
to tell that we don't exactly fit in here?

15:13.121 --> 15:15.329
Well, it was your idea to wear boas, so...

15:16.499 --> 15:18.491
- Have we heard from the guys yet?
- No.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.328
Look, ladies, okay?
We're on our own. Okay?

15:23.339 --> 15:26.923
- How about a little love?
- No, no, no. No, no love.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.712
Engaged. Okay, bye.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.295
Is it just me, or does it seem like

15:32.390 --> 15:34.473
everybody here already bought
what that guy is selling?

15:36.978 --> 15:39.220
Uh... Ladies, stay here, okay?

15:39.689 --> 15:40.770
I think I know where Frost is.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.729
You got a pet. Congratulations.

15:45.278 --> 15:49.397
I call him the Weeper.
I love naming metas.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.856
I know someone else like that.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.735
Three weeks ago,
this young man became a meta-human.

15:54.829 --> 15:58.539
And I acquired my new favorite product
to sell in my network.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.248
Did you notice?

16:02.295 --> 16:03.285
Love,

16:04.338 --> 16:06.625
is, quite literally, in the air.

16:07.967 --> 16:08.957
Do you know why?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.384
Oh.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.521
Pure.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.400
His tears are a drug?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.615
His tears, my dear,

16:39.165 --> 16:40.281
are a gold mine.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.783
One taste and Central City

16:43.794 --> 16:44.784
will be hooked.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.048
Then why do you need me?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.670
Really? Well, if I'm going to be selling
something quite valuable,

16:54.764 --> 16:55.971
I'm going to need protection.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.049
That's what you've got
good old snake-eye for.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.936
A deal like this

17:05.191 --> 17:07.898
requires a lady's touch.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.643
In your case, strength.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.520
And I'll cut you in for 10%.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.983
Fifteen percent, and I throw in
not killing you right now

17:17.078 --> 17:18.239
for your misguided rebellion.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.867
And that's only because
I've got forgiveness in my kidneys. Right?

17:23.376 --> 17:24.537
I think you meant your "heart."

17:24.627 --> 17:26.743
No. There's no
beat-beat in this chest, sister.

17:27.046 --> 17:30.380
As much fun as it is to play
"I'm the bigger badass," I'm bored.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.216
And like I said, I'm done.

17:35.096 --> 17:39.306
Do you know what everyone's mistake
in business is?

17:40.184 --> 17:41.300
<i>Hmm?</i>

17:42.436 --> 17:46.055
Not realizing who has
the power in the room.

17:55.408 --> 17:56.865
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

17:58.578 --> 18:02.572
Ladies, let's put the meta abilities down.

18:02.707 --> 18:03.948
I'm sorry, who is this chick?

18:04.417 --> 18:08.457
Oh, this chick is trying
to stop a meta-fight

18:08.546 --> 18:10.833
from destroying your very enchanting club.

18:11.799 --> 18:12.789
Let's go.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.010
Frost, let's go.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.975
- Should I stop her?
- No.

18:32.486 --> 18:35.149
Let her think she can walk away.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.987
You're lucky she didn't kill you, West.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.664
- Who was that?
- That, was Amunet Black.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.787
Of the underground market?

18:47.877 --> 18:49.243
I'm guessing
this chick has a criminal record?

18:49.337 --> 18:52.546
Yeah. She's been linked to the meta-human
black market selling stolen technology,

18:52.632 --> 18:54.339
but we've never been
able to nail her down.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.382
- And how do you know her?
- Through Caitlin.

18:56.594 --> 18:59.211
Six months ago, Caitlin thought
she had everything under control.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.422
You can't keep a good bad side down
for long, am I right?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.715
She felt me becoming much stronger.

19:03.809 --> 19:07.143
She found out that Amunet had some tech
that would let her stay in charge.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.018
She got desperate,
so she decided to use it.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.641
- But it came with a price tag.
- Which was?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.560
Being her muscle.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.736
Did you kill anyone?

19:18.658 --> 19:21.275
Some people lost their fingers
and their toes, but...

19:22.078 --> 19:23.444
No. No one died.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.529
How are you here, now?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.198
While Caitlin sleeps, I'm awake.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.828
Oh, my God.
You're like the Incredible Hulk!

19:29.919 --> 19:32.411
That's...
I said that with too much chutzpah.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.245
Dialing it back.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.423
Look what are Amunet's plans
for the Weeper?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.166
Not my problem.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.752
Look, he was on that bus.
We helped create him. We need to save him.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.343
No. I need to leave and escape Amunet.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.468
And you're just going to run away?

19:44.558 --> 19:47.096
Listen, there's a reason
the CCPD has not caught her,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.519
and that you idiots just realized
there is a major crime lord

19:49.605 --> 19:51.562
living under your noses
for the past three years.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.644
She's too powerful. We can't stop her.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.732
Guys, we have a responsibility
to the Weeper and to this city.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.069
What do you suggest we do?

19:59.156 --> 20:02.024
We need to rescue him before Amunet
does whatever she's planning, okay?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.025
Cecile, you need to
gather information on Amunet,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.157
and Felicity, you need to
pull up the blueprint to the club.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.654
We got this.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.572
We're strong women.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.157
Yeah.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.409
Hashtag feminism.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.248
Hashtag feminism.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.537
Hashtag feminism.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.792
This isn't what you think, Joe.

20:19.885 --> 20:23.003
Good, because I thought I saw you dancing
on that stage in a gold-sequined bikini.

20:23.097 --> 20:25.555
No. I'm writing a book
on the female experience.

20:25.850 --> 20:26.840
I'd buy that book.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.264
Why does your female experience
include you dancing at The Golden Booty?

20:33.357 --> 20:37.067
Because we live in a society
that's dictated by the male gaze.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.520
I want to control
the narrative of feminism. Okay?

20:39.613 --> 20:42.447
I wanna show the world
that a powerful, strong woman,

20:42.533 --> 20:46.243
she can wear anything.
Be it a bikini or a pantsuit.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.739
Or nothing! Feminism!

20:47.997 --> 20:51.206
That's not how feminism works.
Will you cut it out?

20:51.292 --> 20:52.658
Joanie's practically his daughter.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.628
Hey. Sad Flash,

20:57.214 --> 20:58.204
why the face?

20:58.591 --> 20:59.672
Nothing, I just...

21:00.259 --> 21:02.592
I just love chicken wings so much.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.218
Where are you gonna go?

21:13.522 --> 21:15.354
I know a guy who can breach me
to another Earth.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.900
Start over, escape Amunet,
be who I wanna be.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.863
And that's Killer Frost, right?

21:23.657 --> 21:26.024
Don't be cute, West. You can't stop me.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.610
I wasn't planning on it.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.120
Look, I know you could kill me.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.331
Just like you could have
killed Amunet tonight,

21:33.417 --> 21:35.329
or Cisco six months ago.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.118
But you didn't.

21:38.964 --> 21:43.004
There is a part of you that is good
and decent.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.426
You just don't know how to accept it.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.805
You think you know me now?

21:49.350 --> 21:52.764
No, but I do know what Caitlin looks like
when she's scared.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.267
And you have that same
look in your eyes right now.

21:58.526 --> 22:01.940
You're just as afraid of being Caitlin
as Caitlin is of being Killer Frost.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.490
If you still wanna have a hand
for Barry to put a ring on,

22:08.160 --> 22:09.651
I suggest you move it.

22:16.502 --> 22:21.998
There's a strong, powerful woman
that we both love and fear,

22:22.424 --> 22:23.585
and her name is your mother.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.672
- Does she know you work here?
- Of course not.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.004
She would just jump to all
the same conclusions that you are.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.760
Joanie, your mother and I
just want you to be happy.

22:31.058 --> 22:34.176
But I think you need to ask yourself
why you're keeping this a secret from her.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.262
<i>Joe?</i>

22:38.274 --> 22:41.688
Why didn't Rose make room for Jack
on the door?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.273
There was plenty of room for both of them.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.736
Uh, Cisco, when does this gift of yours
stop giving?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.696
Man, I don't know.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.368
I thought we'd be watching
home movies right now.

22:52.454 --> 22:54.036
Again, you are welcome.

22:54.915 --> 22:56.451
You steal $20 from me, Ralphy?

22:56.584 --> 22:58.371
When? I mean, no.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.247
Yeah, he did. I saw it.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.833
I've been waiting a long time
for this Dibs.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.372
Oh!

23:05.551 --> 23:06.883
You monster!

23:19.857 --> 23:21.689
Everybody, stop! I'm a cop!

23:22.902 --> 23:24.313
I'm the Flash!

23:29.867 --> 23:30.857
You're late.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.906
I'm right on time.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.871
What, were you expecting a different meta?

23:41.629 --> 23:43.370
Nobody walks away from me, Frost.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.608
Did you really think
I was going to let you

24:09.698 --> 24:11.564
just breach into the sunset?

24:12.993 --> 24:14.609
You owe me your life.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.507
And I always take what I'm owed.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.305
Hands over your head, ma'am.

24:43.065 --> 24:45.273
Is there any part
of the way that I'm dressed

24:45.359 --> 24:47.601
that leads you to believe
I want to be called "ma'am"?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.356
Hmm?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.078
Ugh.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.490
Blood.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.584
Kill you later, Caity.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.516
Let me help you.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.227
Please.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.148
Okay.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.944
It's already knotted.
You just have to pull it tight.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.197
Thanks.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.037
Yeah.

25:48.839 --> 25:49.829
What happened?

25:50.924 --> 25:51.914
You don't remember?

25:52.593 --> 25:56.257
When she's in control,
I don't remember much of what happens.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.421
Did she...

25:59.141 --> 26:00.723
I hurt anyone?

26:01.977 --> 26:03.434
Just that snake-eyed scumbag.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.100
Didn't kill him though.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.394
So, the cure, it...

26:10.027 --> 26:11.017
Didn't work.

26:11.403 --> 26:12.610
Not all the way.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.191
Which is why you wanted to leave tonight?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.569
And why it took you
six months to come back?

26:17.659 --> 26:18.900
When Cisco said he was gonna get Barry

26:18.994 --> 26:20.826
back from the Speed Force,
I thought that

26:21.705 --> 26:25.164
maybe I could come back and make up
for some of the pain that I caused.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.367
But she's getting stronger.

26:29.880 --> 26:30.961
I never should have come back.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.336
That's not true, Caitlin.
You can always come back to your friends.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.001
Why didn't you tell any of us?

26:36.804 --> 26:38.136
I didn't know who to talk to.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.295
You could have talked to me.

26:40.182 --> 26:41.593
I'm your friend, Caitlin.

26:41.809 --> 26:42.799
Work friend.

26:43.769 --> 26:47.103
I mean, it's not like you and I have
become besties over the last few years.

26:48.690 --> 26:49.931
Yeah, I guess we haven't.

26:59.243 --> 27:02.577
Hey. Jerry, buddy.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.738
We gonna get that phone call or what?

27:05.541 --> 27:06.873
Hey, come on, man.

27:06.959 --> 27:09.952
I know you can hear me.
I'm right here. Hello.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.207
Okay. Great.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.752
You just know everybody, don't you?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.425
Yeah, I've been here a few times.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.883
You know, I could wiggle through
these bars and get us out of here.

27:21.098 --> 27:23.556
I may make my finger into a key.
That'd be pretty sweet.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.888
Lot of pressure put on
the index finger though.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.387
Iron versus flesh.

27:29.523 --> 27:31.264
- What do you think?
- I think you should stop talking,

27:31.358 --> 27:32.348
immediately.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.318
I don't ever have to drink again.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.531
Words uttered by everybody
who's ever had too many. Here.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.331
This was a bust, huh?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.375
It's a bachelor party.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.035
Happens.

27:54.715 --> 27:55.705
What's up with you?

27:56.592 --> 27:58.584
All night, you've seemed preoccupied.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.837
I'm worried.

28:03.223 --> 28:04.213
About what?

28:05.309 --> 28:07.266
Being a dad again. I'm almost 50, Barr.

28:07.352 --> 28:08.433
Mmm-hmm.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.265
I saw that video Cisco made of
you and Iris when you were kids and it...

28:13.942 --> 28:15.478
Hit me like a ton of bricks.

28:17.487 --> 28:18.477
I was...

28:18.739 --> 28:20.446
I was young the first time I did this.

28:21.325 --> 28:22.657
And then seeing Joanie.

28:25.996 --> 28:27.658
<i>It's hard raising humans, Barr.</i>

28:27.956 --> 28:28.946
You'll be fine.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.248
I barely get enough sleep as it is,

28:32.085 --> 28:33.371
worrying about you three.

28:34.588 --> 28:36.250
Especially with Wally being gone.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.623
Add to that a crazy baby schedule.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.837
Feeding, crying...

28:41.553 --> 28:43.089
I'm honestly scared to death.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.802
Joe, when you raised Iris, you were alone.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.847
When you took me in, you were alone.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.229
And you know,
when Wally showed up, you were alone.

28:53.523 --> 28:55.936
You did all that, by yourself.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.267
Single parent.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.227
No one could have done a better job.
No one.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.939
Now you've got a partner.

29:02.783 --> 29:04.115
You've got family.

29:04.534 --> 29:06.400
You've always been there for us
when we've needed you,

29:06.495 --> 29:08.282
and now it's just our turn
to do that for you.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.285
And we will.

29:16.213 --> 29:17.249
I know you will.

29:21.551 --> 29:22.541
I'll take those three.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.295
Four.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.974
These tears are more than just water.

29:38.527 --> 29:42.567
When ingested, the dark matter inside it
alters the brain function

29:42.656 --> 29:44.522
like that of a psychoactive drug.

29:44.616 --> 29:46.152
So it's like what, an opioid?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.075
It's like a love drug.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.153
- From tears?
- If this spreads,

29:50.247 --> 29:52.330
Central City's gonna have a massive
drug problem on its hands.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.157
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, well, we need to stop

29:54.251 --> 29:57.039
Amunet and save the Weeper
before that happens.

29:57.671 --> 29:58.661
How do we find her?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.372
I don't know. She's smart.
Off the grid.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.883
Always on the move, never leaves a trail.

30:03.969 --> 30:04.959
Okay, what about her powers?

30:05.053 --> 30:07.045
The metal that she controls.
Do you know what it is?

30:07.139 --> 30:09.005
It's some kind of alnico alloy.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.633
Do you think you could
use our satellites to track it?

30:11.727 --> 30:13.263
You mean run a geological scan of the city

30:13.353 --> 30:15.766
for small-scale signatures
of aluminum, nickel and cobalt?

30:16.523 --> 30:17.604
Girl, please.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.893
There. She's headed to Lawrence Hills.

30:22.029 --> 30:25.522
That's all industrial out there.
That's steel mills, docks, warehouses.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.151
- Okay, we need to stop her.
- Okay.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.533
<i>Guys, I can't go with you.</i>

30:29.619 --> 30:32.828
If I lose control,
I could become a liability.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.706
I'm sorry, Iris, I can't go.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.704
You don't have to.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.201
We got this.

30:39.880 --> 30:40.870
Okay.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.728
Ladies, what's your status?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.316
We're in position.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.191
I think you'll be pleased.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.331
- This is him?
- Hmm.

31:27.803 --> 31:29.010
Good boy.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.050
Sample.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.651
I'll take him.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.276
- On my count, we move.
- Okay.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.782
<i>One, two...</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:57.029
Three.

32:08.552 --> 32:09.963
I remember you.

32:11.721 --> 32:14.885
You are the chick from the bar, hmm?

32:17.102 --> 32:18.092
Oh, no.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.639
<i>Hey, Amunet.</i>

32:29.406 --> 32:31.363
This is between you and me.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.863
Let my friends go,
and I'll come back and work for you.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.576
It's too late for that, Caity.

32:40.125 --> 32:44.290
Do you know why no one has ever
testified against me over the years?

32:45.839 --> 32:47.956
Well, it's because they're not alive to.

32:50.760 --> 32:51.750
Sorry.

32:53.305 --> 32:54.421
Take care of them.

32:58.685 --> 32:59.971
No!

33:10.697 --> 33:12.313
Well, hello, Chilly.

33:12.908 --> 33:13.898
We got to get out of here.

33:17.871 --> 33:20.739
And I thought I wasn't going to be
able to kill anyone today.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.081
Kill them!

33:34.638 --> 33:36.550
I don't think this is gonna
hold much longer.

33:36.848 --> 33:39.716
Well, this is a steel factory,
and you move steel plates with...

33:39.809 --> 33:40.799
Magnets.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.718
Really, really big magnets.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.264
Cecile, turn the crane on.

33:46.441 --> 33:48.023
What? How?

33:48.109 --> 33:50.567
It should be in the schematics.
Just highlight it and turn it on.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.311
Okay, I'm...

34:08.004 --> 34:10.712
You and I could have been gods.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.339
I used to work with a god.

34:12.801 --> 34:13.791
Over it.

34:15.262 --> 34:16.252
Cecile, now!

34:31.902 --> 34:35.021
Not so scary without your bling, now,
are you, sister?

34:38.076 --> 34:39.065
Stop!

34:41.413 --> 34:42.745
Caitlin, stop.

34:42.914 --> 34:44.030
I'm not Caitlin.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.453
And I'll never be free unless she dies.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.000
No, it's the opposite.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.952
You are free right now.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.789
But if you do this,
you will always be a killer.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.670
Killer Frost, Caitlin,
you don't have to be one or the other.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.877
You get to decide who you are.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.302
Get out of here.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.596
You've ruined this for me today.

35:09.566 --> 35:13.401
And one day soon, I promise you,
I will ruin something for you.

35:19.701 --> 35:20.942
Hold on.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.778
It's okay, okay? We're gonna help you.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.034
- Get away from me.
- Wait...

35:29.711 --> 35:30.701
The police are on their way.

35:31.921 --> 35:33.913
We did it, guys. We really did it.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.836
Actually, it's "girls."

35:46.895 --> 35:49.729
I'm gonna have a headache now
until my wedding day.

35:49.814 --> 35:50.804
Worth it.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.765
Agree to never speak about what
happened tonight?

35:52.901 --> 35:54.142
- Agreed.
- If I have to.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.730
What?

35:56.363 --> 35:59.947
Hey, I saw you called 17 times.
Everything okay?

36:00.116 --> 36:02.824
Yeah, everything is fine.
How was your night?

36:04.329 --> 36:05.319
Good.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.116
- Quiet.
- Uneventful.

36:07.207 --> 36:10.041
- Yours?
- Yeah. Not much happened.

36:10.502 --> 36:12.710
You know what,
we actually had a few scrapes.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.290
Honestly, so did we.

36:14.381 --> 36:15.497
Tears were involved.

36:16.132 --> 36:17.293
Yeah. Us, too.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.876
More crying, then puking.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.762
Lost access to the happiest
place on Earth.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.641
Pretty sure nothing could have
made tonight any worse.

36:29.270 --> 36:31.512
I'm so tired.

36:31.981 --> 36:34.143
I'm so tired.
Can we just do this tomorrow, please?

36:35.610 --> 36:38.603
Oh, Chicks with white hair. Hot!

36:38.905 --> 36:40.521
Why is Killer Frost here?

36:40.907 --> 36:41.897
Guys...

36:42.784 --> 36:45.822
She has something
that she wants to tell you.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.120
<i>And you all should listen.</i>

37:00.093 --> 37:02.176
Aww... It's just Caitlin.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.675
I can explain everything.

37:15.275 --> 37:16.265
Hey, Joe.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.100
Hey.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.566
When you got arrested, I figured
you'd be okay, 'cause you're a cop,

37:21.656 --> 37:22.737
but still...

37:24.409 --> 37:25.490
Yeah, we're all fine.

37:27.537 --> 37:28.527
How was the rest of your night?

37:29.122 --> 37:30.158
It was fine.

37:31.624 --> 37:32.910
Joe, I'm gonna do what I want.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.335
I know, you're an adult.
I was not trying to tell you what to do.

37:37.380 --> 37:38.587
But if I'm being honest,

37:39.090 --> 37:40.672
I know that I took it too far tonight.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.467
Then, what about your feminist research?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.886
I still believe everything I was saying.

37:47.098 --> 37:50.262
But after we talked, I realized
that's not why I'm working there.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.432
So I'm gonna quit.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.561
Are you gonna tell Mom?

37:54.773 --> 37:56.014
<i>That's not my secret to tell.</i>

37:56.191 --> 37:57.978
But your mom loves you.

37:59.027 --> 38:01.519
And she'll always listen,
if you let her.

38:03.490 --> 38:04.822
Just got my first craving.

38:06.868 --> 38:07.984
Hi, you two.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.110
How was your night?

38:11.039 --> 38:12.746
It was fine. Nothing happened.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.822
- You?
- Oh...

38:15.126 --> 38:16.708
Same. Super chill.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.997
I'm gonna head to bed. But do you wanna
do breakfast in the morning and just talk?

38:21.090 --> 38:23.548
- Yeah, sweetie, I'd like that. Okay.
- Okay.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.504
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.181
- I gotta tell you something.
- Mmm?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.221
This kid of ours,

38:33.645 --> 38:35.181
definitely not a vegetarian.

38:36.689 --> 38:38.225
"This kid of ours."

38:40.193 --> 38:41.559
Cecile, I gotta tell you,

38:41.820 --> 38:45.860
I never thought I'd even have
a second chance at love, and here you are.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.481
You're my everything.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.451
To top that miracle,
we're having this baby.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.575
It's exciting.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.374
Is it okay to say that
I'm scared?

38:57.627 --> 38:59.459
I'm so glad that you told me that.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.704
'Cause I am terrified.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.297
- Really?
- Yes. Really.

39:03.383 --> 39:06.251
I thought that I'd finally
hit this groove in my life,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.802
in my career, and with you, and now,

39:09.222 --> 39:12.806
this changes everything.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.350
The last thing I thought at our age
we'd be having a baby.

39:15.436 --> 39:16.426
I know!

39:18.356 --> 39:20.598
It's scary. But I figure

39:21.568 --> 39:24.606
pretty much all we gotta do is love this
baby as much as we love each other.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.155
- That's a lot of love.
- Yeah.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.699
So much for quiet and classy, right?

39:34.789 --> 39:37.247
Not exactly the bachelorette party
you had in mind.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.370
Well, saving the city wasn't a bad way
to spend the night.

39:39.586 --> 39:42.829
But the best part of the night was
spending it with the ladies of Team Flash.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.630
It was. When we weren't
almost getting killed.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.383
- Yeah, we should do it more often.
- We should.

39:48.595 --> 39:51.133
The "hanging out" part, not
the "almost getting killed" part.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.258
I'd like that.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.888
Actually, I wanted to ask you a favor
about the wedding.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.802
Oh. You want a custom ice sculpture?

39:59.063 --> 40:00.679
No.

40:00.773 --> 40:01.854
Um...

40:01.941 --> 40:05.901
I wanted to know if you wanted to
be my maid of honor.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.187
- Me?
- Yeah.

40:08.281 --> 40:11.069
We're more than work friends,
and we've been through a lot together.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.822
Weddings are all about
new beginnings, right?

40:15.288 --> 40:17.905
So, what do you say?
You wanna stand up for me?

40:19.626 --> 40:20.616
I do.

40:21.794 --> 40:23.376
I guess that's your line though, right?

40:28.426 --> 40:29.416
Thank you.

40:30.637 --> 40:32.629
- I'm so excited!
- I know. I'm excited, too.

40:32.722 --> 40:34.930
- Do I have a bridesmaid's dress?
- Of course.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.919
<i>I went through
a lot of trouble</i>

41:06.673 --> 41:08.915
creating you.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.756
I can't have you running away.

41:15.848 --> 41:19.387
Not until you've completed the task
for which you were born.
