00:09.676 --> 00:12.175
WA YE news time, 8:05.

00:12.275 --> 00:15.875
It's gonna be partly cloudy, breezy
and warm today with highs around 80.

00:15.975 --> 00:18.076
Right now in Baltimore, sunny skies.

00:18.176 --> 00:20.875
And here's one of my morning favorites.

00:32.876 --> 00:35.475
Yo, Ott. Santo Rey's late?

00:35.775 --> 00:38.376
Squall last night off of Hampton Roads.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.471
76-72 KGA.

03:58.971 --> 04:01.271
KGA, go ahead, 76-72.

04:01.370 --> 04:05.670
Notify Homicide and the OCME.
We got a floater at Patapsco Terminal.

04:05.771 --> 04:07.271
Copy that.

05:58.168 --> 05:59.969
Nothing at Vondopoulos's house?

06:00.069 --> 06:01.769
He's not going back.

06:01.869 --> 06:05.469
He's dumped his Benz and our GPS device
in the downtown garage.

06:05.569 --> 06:07.269
He's off the cell phones.

06:07.369 --> 06:09.468
And there's no text messaging
in Greek either.

06:09.668 --> 06:12.468
The raids, the follow,
one or both sent him underground.

06:12.568 --> 06:16.968
This guy, Stephen Rados? What's he?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.767
He rented the hotel room
for the meet with Vondopoulos.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.367
But checked out right after.

06:21.467 --> 06:23.568
Fitzhugh's running him
through every database.

06:23.668 --> 06:26.167
So far, nothing but a driver's license in D.C.

06:26.267 --> 06:28.668
Lester. Homicide for you, line 2.

06:29.768 --> 06:31.668
Maybe Sobotka knows him.

06:31.768 --> 06:35.867
When Sobotka comes in today, maybe
he gives us a line on every last Greek.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.367
Freamon here.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.567
Thirteen or so coming across the fax
from VICAP.

06:44.467 --> 06:45.967
All of them John Does.

06:46.067 --> 06:49.166
And that's just headless and handless
in the mid-Atlantic region.

06:49.267 --> 06:51.867
If you wanna go nationwide,
you'll be up over four dozen.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.366
-Fuck me.
-What can I tell you, kiddo?

06:54.467 --> 06:58.367
We are policing a culture in moral decline.
So, you want to come get these?

06:58.468 --> 07:00.867
Or should I have a uniform
run them over to Southeast?

07:00.967 --> 07:03.367
-Run them over to Southeast.
-Okay.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.266
-Have a seat.
-I can't.

07:27.666 --> 07:30.467
Gotta get back out there,
take care of business.

07:30.566 --> 07:32.966
Just wanted to make sure
they were treating you right.

07:33.066 --> 07:36.866
Making the most of it.
I'm catching up on my reading at least.

07:37.366 --> 07:40.565
I just want to let you know
that we got your back.

07:40.766 --> 07:44.165
You know, whoever did this, we'll find them.

07:44.866 --> 07:46.266
We got you, you understand?

07:46.366 --> 07:49.265
I appreciate the offer,
but that won't be necessary.

07:49.966 --> 07:51.867
Inform Mr. Barksdale that any obligation...

07:51.967 --> 07:54.566
he feels he might have
with regards to this incident...

07:54.666 --> 07:57.866
it's absolved, along with our agreement.

07:59.666 --> 08:00.966
All I'm saying is--

08:01.066 --> 08:03.066
I understand perfectly well
what you're saying.

08:03.166 --> 08:07.865
What I am saying to you is:
I will take care of them myself.

08:10.665 --> 08:11.966
Them?

08:15.065 --> 08:16.565
Who came at you?

08:22.765 --> 08:24.765
Thank you for your concern.

08:37.765 --> 08:40.563
Easy, Nick. Easy.

08:41.964 --> 08:45.764
I'm gonna kill them.
Fucking Greek bastards.

08:46.665 --> 08:47.965
Get out of my fucking way!

08:48.065 --> 08:50.165
Get off of me! Fuck all of you!

08:50.565 --> 08:53.764
He was there for all of you,
and now you're nowhere for him.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.964
What the fuck you gonna do?

08:56.665 --> 08:59.064
Get a gun? Go play gangster?

08:59.164 --> 09:00.964
Like your fucking cousin?

09:30.263 --> 09:31.564
Let's go.

10:03.962 --> 10:05.863
What was she firing, yo?

10:06.363 --> 10:08.762
Dirty Bomb, with a red-top chaser.

10:11.663 --> 10:14.263
Damn, yo. The bomb is the bomb.

10:27.462 --> 10:30.162
Opportunity knocking. Keep a lookout.

10:51.761 --> 10:54.462
He just boosted the whole fucking truck.

10:57.462 --> 10:59.362
Good looking out, Johnny.

11:18.061 --> 11:20.261
At least I remembered to call.

11:20.361 --> 11:22.361
Stabbed repeatedly.

11:22.961 --> 11:26.460
Torso, abdomen,
and they cut his throat to be sure.

11:27.961 --> 11:30.361
Single-edge blade. He fought, too.

11:30.861 --> 11:32.761
Defense wounds on both hands.

11:32.861 --> 11:34.661
Ligature on both legs.

11:34.961 --> 11:38.461
Weighed him down with something,
but it slipped off in the drink.

11:38.561 --> 11:40.561
One, two, three.

11:59.760 --> 12:03.060
Fuck it.
This Sobotka kid knows there's a warrant.

12:03.160 --> 12:06.061
He either turns himself in or not.
Who gives a fuck?

12:06.161 --> 12:10.060
Either we get to him now and roll him,
or he comes into the district with a lawyer.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.760
He comes in with a lawyer, he's less likely
to go for something in the box.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.960
You sound like McNulty now.

12:17.260 --> 12:21.559
We stay with these guys on their cases,
we ain't never gonna get no respect.

12:21.659 --> 12:23.159
You know this.

12:23.960 --> 12:27.259
I figure when the detail's over,
I go back to straight narcotics.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.560
Try to get over to Dawson's shift,
find a new rabbi.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.760
What about you?

12:34.060 --> 12:35.360
Don't know.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.060
I mean, you gotta admit,
Daniels has been okay for us.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.559
I mean, he's there for his troops.

12:49.759 --> 12:53.259
-You gotta be shitting me.
-I just came from the crime scene.

12:53.359 --> 12:54.858
He was coming in as a cooperator.

12:55.059 --> 12:58.159
Offering up the drug-and-prostitution ring
he'd been smuggling for.

12:58.259 --> 13:01.759
The guy lays down with gangsters,
gets up with his throat cut.

13:02.460 --> 13:05.259
Almost feel sorry for the son of a bitch.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.759
You were right about Sobotka.

13:10.359 --> 13:13.158
Case had enough legs on it
that I've got Burrell committed...

13:13.259 --> 13:17.459
to keeping my crew together
as a major case squad working out of CID.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.758
If you are gonna charge him....

13:22.958 --> 13:24.958
I'm gonna charge his narrow ass.

13:25.159 --> 13:26.759
You're gonna do your son-in-law?

13:26.859 --> 13:31.258
You don't think I didn't tell her
not to marry that brain-dead son of a bitch?

13:32.958 --> 13:37.359
I'll tell you the truth, Major.
Everyone who saw the punch wrote on it.

13:37.858 --> 13:41.158
And they've all got Prez
throwing the punch, no question.

13:41.258 --> 13:45.558
But they've also got you addressing
a subordinate officer as a....

13:45.658 --> 13:47.857
What was it? A shitbird?

13:49.757 --> 13:50.957
Fuck you.

13:51.257 --> 13:55.258
This is the Baltimore Police Department,
not the Roland Park Ladies' Tea.

13:55.358 --> 13:56.458
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

13:56.458 --> 13:58.058
I'm just saying, the other detectives...

13:59.358 --> 14:02.858
the FBI agents,
they gotta write it the way it happened.

14:02.958 --> 14:07.058
I mean, I could probably get my own people
to cheat it for you, but the FBl....

14:07.158 --> 14:09.557
You know how tight-assed they are.

14:13.457 --> 14:16.757
Roland Pryzbylewski rides
the Southeastern desk...

14:16.857 --> 14:19.056
on midnight shift for two months.

14:19.857 --> 14:23.158
During which time he writes
a personal letter of apology...

14:23.258 --> 14:25.658
to everyone seen that punch throwed.

14:25.857 --> 14:30.658
In which he makes it absolutely clear
that it was a penny-cheap sucker punch...

14:30.857 --> 14:33.657
that would've got his ass kicked in
by a real police...

14:33.757 --> 14:37.556
except for the fact that I have
my daughter's feelings to consider.

14:37.656 --> 14:40.856
And then he can come up here
and say the same to my face...

14:40.956 --> 14:44.956
and after that, if he wants
to piss his career away in your unit...

14:45.056 --> 14:47.257
I could give a hairy-ass fuck.

14:49.757 --> 14:51.257
Lieutenant.

14:55.057 --> 14:57.656
Rod, that shit goes into a supplemental.

14:57.756 --> 15:00.656
-You don't put witnesses on a face sheet.
-Officer.

15:02.256 --> 15:05.357
You got something for Freamon?
Homicide sent it over.

15:07.456 --> 15:10.956
Officer, my son wants
to turn himself in on a warrant.

15:11.656 --> 15:13.955
Everybody talks, nobody listens.

15:14.455 --> 15:17.656
Mike, that asshole calls back,
I'm in the shitter.

15:18.956 --> 15:23.256
-Now what can I do for you, gents?
-You got a warrant on me for drugs.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.656
-I'm turning myself in.
-A Southeastern warrant?

15:27.255 --> 15:30.955
He's surrendering.
He's gonna cooperate in any way he can.

15:31.156 --> 15:35.555
-What name am I looking for?
-Sobotka. Nicholas Sobotka.

15:40.855 --> 15:43.455
Morphine? From a city ambo?

15:43.955 --> 15:47.155
You should be ashamed
to be calling me on this one.

16:02.355 --> 16:05.554
-The body came up.
-I saw, on the television.

16:05.654 --> 16:07.855
We weighted him down
pretty goddamn good...

16:07.955 --> 16:10.454
but the water just coughed him back up.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.354
Bad luck, that's all.

16:13.155 --> 16:15.655
Sergei would've done better, I admit.

16:16.355 --> 16:19.755
Niko, the nephew. By now he knows.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.355
Our people wait for him,
but so do the police.

16:23.854 --> 16:25.554
I am thinking...

16:26.655 --> 16:29.454
there's nothing to be done at this point.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.954
What he says, he says.

16:32.654 --> 16:36.254
He knows my name.
But my name is not my name.

16:37.254 --> 16:38.454
And you?

16:39.654 --> 16:41.655
To them, you're only "The Greek."

16:41.755 --> 16:45.155
And, of course, I'm not even Greek.

16:51.054 --> 16:52.354
So we go.

16:53.653 --> 16:57.253
But there's a little business to do first.

16:58.254 --> 17:01.054
There's a shipment on the docks this week.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.854
-One hundred and fifty kilograms.
-And no one to pick it up.

17:06.252 --> 17:08.753
Not just Sergei, I miss Frank, too.

17:10.954 --> 17:13.954
We can't disappear the can.
But maybe we send someone.

17:14.054 --> 17:16.554
Bring it off the docks, legitimate.

17:17.252 --> 17:21.354
Everywhere we go these days,
we seem to be walking into police.

17:22.252 --> 17:24.453
This is telling us something.

17:26.353 --> 17:30.252
You're going to leave 15 million tholaria
to rot on the pier?

17:33.852 --> 17:37.453
Lambs go to slaughter.
A man, he learns when to walk away.

17:37.553 --> 17:38.853
No, we go.

17:40.953 --> 17:42.653
Call the others in.

17:43.653 --> 17:46.553
Let them know there is no longer any point.

18:00.252 --> 18:01.752
We don't wait?

18:01.852 --> 18:03.552
Our friends are still there, no?

18:03.652 --> 18:05.753
-Still here.
-Then go.

18:24.452 --> 18:26.452
Sobotka was a cooperator?

18:26.651 --> 18:29.151
We had preliminary discussions
with him yesterday.

18:29.252 --> 18:31.951
He agreed to post today
with a lawyer, but instead....

18:32.051 --> 18:33.752
So what's left of the case?

18:33.852 --> 18:37.552
We've pulled in everyone caught up
in the wiretaps, save for a couple bodies.

18:37.652 --> 18:40.552
We left the man we think is the number two
for the operation...

18:40.652 --> 18:42.852
on the street,
hoping he'd lead us to number one.

18:42.952 --> 18:44.851
We have people on him?

18:45.551 --> 18:47.451
He's out of pocket at the moment.

18:47.551 --> 18:51.551
Last seen leaving a downtown hotel,
but we expect he'll resurface.

18:52.851 --> 18:54.351
And the union people?

18:54.451 --> 18:58.050
With Sobotka dead, the case right now
is limited to a subordinate or two.

18:58.150 --> 19:00.752
But the important thing for us is the union.

19:00.852 --> 19:03.051
Either they jettison
their current leadership...

19:03.151 --> 19:05.551
or we have enough
to get that local decertified.

19:05.651 --> 19:08.551
Leaving only me and my 14 bodies.

19:09.051 --> 19:11.450
When do we get to that bit of business?

19:12.651 --> 19:16.750
Lt. Daniels? Line 2. Det. Freamon
insisted I put him through.

19:20.250 --> 19:23.550
In all likelihood, Frank Sobotka
was going to speak to that.

19:23.650 --> 19:26.251
Now, we're a step back, sorry to say.

19:26.650 --> 19:29.251
-Sobotka came in.
-The nephew?

19:29.351 --> 19:30.951
Yeah, he flipped.

19:31.951 --> 19:35.150
Come on, Bubs. You gotta do better
if you wanna walk on this.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.251
-How about some murders?
-How about them?

19:37.351 --> 19:40.050
They're not killing people
in West Baltimore these days?

19:40.150 --> 19:41.250
Been quiet.

19:41.350 --> 19:43.850
Except for that mess
with that young boy who got hit...

19:43.950 --> 19:46.450
with the stray through the window,
ain't been nothing.

19:46.550 --> 19:49.050
-How about that?
-I ain't got nothing on that one.

19:49.150 --> 19:51.150
It's just two crews beefing over a corner.

19:51.249 --> 19:53.850
You know what, Bubs? You going to jail.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.250
How you gonna talk about going to jail?

19:56.350 --> 19:57.850
You hearing this, Johnny?

19:57.950 --> 20:01.350
Like we ain't got history in this room.
Like we ain't friends or nothing.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.449
When you was up in that hospital,
all I did was worry.

20:04.549 --> 20:07.550
"What about Kima? What's up with my girl?"

20:07.650 --> 20:11.449
I'm just happy to see you're up in the mix...

20:11.549 --> 20:14.050
and you talking about jail and shit.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.249
That's too cold, girl, damn.

20:20.949 --> 20:23.549
Remember that Eastsider
got shot in the high-rises, right?

20:23.649 --> 20:25.050
You remember that shit, right?

20:25.150 --> 20:27.650
I mean, you were right there, Bubbles.

20:27.749 --> 20:30.850
That wasn't shit.
Boy got hit with a rat shot, that all.

20:30.950 --> 20:33.349
-Who you talking about?
-Boy named Cheese.

20:33.449 --> 20:36.749
Him and the other Eastsiders
moved into the Terrace...

20:36.849 --> 20:39.548
took over a couple towers
from the Stringer Bell's boys.

20:39.648 --> 20:43.549
Then some crazy-ass bow-tie nigger
came in and chased his ass home.

20:43.649 --> 20:45.048
And what happened?

20:45.249 --> 20:47.449
Mr. Bow Tie, he ran them off.

20:48.148 --> 20:51.148
He told them Eastsider fools,
"Them towers belong to Avon."

20:51.248 --> 20:52.849
But then he ain't come back no more.

20:52.949 --> 20:55.649
Now them Eastsiders
are back up in there steady slinging.

20:55.749 --> 20:57.748
I mean, it ain't like a war or nothing.

20:57.848 --> 21:00.849
It's like Stringer Bell and them are sharing.

21:01.448 --> 21:02.648
Sharing?

21:07.148 --> 21:09.149
You guys are on all of it?

21:11.448 --> 21:14.347
You have a public defender
sitting next to you, Mr. Sobotka.

21:14.447 --> 21:17.048
If there's anything about this deal
you don't understand--

21:17.148 --> 21:18.948
They killed my uncle.

21:19.048 --> 21:21.448
I don't need to talk to no one
but you people.

21:21.548 --> 21:23.648
How do you know they did it?

21:30.448 --> 21:31.748
I told....

21:41.847 --> 21:45.447
Spiros calls me
after everybody's getting arrested, right?

21:47.446 --> 21:50.448
Tells me he wants us
to keep our mouths shut...

21:50.947 --> 21:53.748
but Uncle Frank, he says he ain't gonna.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.647
Says he's gonna go talk to the police.

21:57.547 --> 22:00.447
Spiros says that if we keep quiet...

22:00.847 --> 22:03.547
they can help my cousin, Zig, you know?

22:03.947 --> 22:06.247
And now Spiros is saying that...

22:06.447 --> 22:10.347
I don't know, the kid,
the one that didn't die...

22:10.447 --> 22:12.346
the one that got shot...

22:12.446 --> 22:16.247
he's gonna say that the gun, it wasn't Zig's.

22:17.048 --> 22:20.847
That Glekas pulled the gun,
and it wasn't really Zig's fault.

22:22.346 --> 22:25.547
So your uncle went to meet them
and talk about that?

22:25.646 --> 22:27.446
Under the Key Bridge.

22:30.047 --> 22:33.046
I seen his car was still there this morning.

22:34.246 --> 22:36.346
I seen that, I fucking knew.

22:37.146 --> 22:39.946
If they killed your uncle to shut him up,
they probably--

22:40.046 --> 22:41.746
Wanna kill me, too?

22:44.446 --> 22:45.546
Shit!

22:47.047 --> 22:49.946
I was gonna go down with him
to the bridge.

22:50.946 --> 22:53.346
I was gonna go down there with him.

22:54.146 --> 22:55.646
He wouldn't....

23:00.745 --> 23:03.246
You were involved in the smuggling?

23:06.345 --> 23:08.646
We didn't know about the girls.

23:09.145 --> 23:10.745
Them girls that got found?

23:10.845 --> 23:14.046
-We didn't know there were girls in there.
-You thought it was drugs?

23:14.146 --> 23:16.546
Drugs, stolen shit, whatever.

23:16.846 --> 23:21.045
We got paid by the can
to creep shit off the docks. That's all.

23:21.145 --> 23:25.246
That and selling the drugs
that you got from The Greek, too, right?

23:27.545 --> 23:29.945
That's your cousin's signed statement.

23:30.045 --> 23:33.045
He put himself in,
talked about buying the gun.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.744
The bill of sale
from the pawn shop is in there, too.

23:35.844 --> 23:39.946
It wouldn't have mattered if the
second victim had backed up on his story.

23:40.046 --> 23:42.045
Your cousin was locked in.

23:45.945 --> 23:49.245
Your uncle was sitting yesterday
right where you're sitting now...

23:49.345 --> 23:53.345
ready to give us everything, if we made
the drug charges go away for you.

23:53.445 --> 23:57.344
And maybe got your cousin
to a better lock-up than Eager Street.

23:57.744 --> 24:00.644
As you can see,
we're willing to honor that deal...

24:00.744 --> 24:03.444
even if it didn't happen for your uncle.

24:11.045 --> 24:13.045
Spiros was the main guy.

24:13.844 --> 24:16.545
He told me and Frank
which cans to disappear...

24:16.645 --> 24:20.644
and then when it came to me and the drugs,
he was the one that hooked that up, too.

24:20.744 --> 24:24.744
The lsraeli, he was their drug guy.
I went through him for all my re-ups...

24:24.844 --> 24:28.743
until they passed me off
to White Mike McArdle. You know Mike?

24:30.543 --> 24:31.544
Guess you do.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.543
Double G was in charge of stolen shit.

24:33.643 --> 24:36.745
Anything we could lift from the docks
went straight to his store...

24:36.844 --> 24:39.944
but he's dead,
so why am I wasting your time, right?

24:40.044 --> 24:41.144
Her, I don't know.

24:42.544 --> 24:45.443
My uncle, you know about him.

24:47.643 --> 24:50.743
I don't know
why you got Horse's picture up there.

24:50.843 --> 24:53.743
Horse don't know shit. I'll testify to that.

24:54.143 --> 24:55.643
What about the Russian?

24:55.743 --> 24:57.343
He drove for them.

24:57.443 --> 25:01.043
Anything that had to come off the docks,
he was their guy.

25:01.143 --> 25:04.844
But I also got the feeling
that if somebody had to get hurt...

25:05.043 --> 25:07.843
he was probably going to be around
for that part of it, too.

25:07.944 --> 25:09.643
Why did you think that?

25:09.744 --> 25:12.343
Sergei, he just carried it like that.

25:13.043 --> 25:16.043
And also, after them girls died in the can...

25:16.742 --> 25:20.042
they told me that whoever fucked that up...

25:20.442 --> 25:22.843
they had already got to in Philly.

25:22.943 --> 25:26.343
They said that
whoever did that to them girls was dead.

25:26.642 --> 25:28.542
And how did they say it?

25:28.842 --> 25:32.743
They just said, I don't know...

25:33.743 --> 25:36.642
that the guy that you all was looking for...

25:36.742 --> 25:38.442
he was a dead end.

25:39.443 --> 25:41.742
-A dead end?
-Yeah.

25:42.843 --> 25:44.642
In Philly, they said.

25:48.642 --> 25:50.141
Who's the suit?

25:56.042 --> 25:57.341
You sure?

25:58.042 --> 26:00.942
We know that someone
is above your man Spiros.

26:01.042 --> 26:03.642
Someone he was in communication with.

26:04.142 --> 26:05.642
Yeah, The Greek.

26:05.742 --> 26:09.742
Sure, I know who you mean.
I mean, I don't have a name or nothing.

26:10.442 --> 26:11.541
The man in the suit...

26:11.641 --> 26:13.741
the man with Vondopoulos
in the photograph.

26:13.941 --> 26:15.641
That's not The Greek?

26:25.541 --> 26:27.742
That's The Greek right there.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.342
That the guy?

26:40.541 --> 26:43.040
He picked out an Eastsider, all right.

26:43.140 --> 26:45.441
Cheese runs with Proposition Joe's mob.

26:45.541 --> 26:48.240
Had a few corners off of Ashland,
last I heard.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.041
-What's the verdict?
-He did good for us.

26:51.141 --> 26:54.040
-So I'm out the stat?
-I owe you one, Sanny.

27:04.241 --> 27:07.040
-Both of them?
-Yeah, that one's his valet.

27:07.341 --> 27:09.241
Can I use your bathroom?

27:09.341 --> 27:11.340
Fuck, no. Get out of here.

27:11.940 --> 27:15.340
Bubs, one last question.
How's product in the Towers?

27:16.239 --> 27:18.239
It was shit, now it's right.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.939
Found this guy.
Federal court computer down in D.C.

27:33.540 --> 27:35.240
But not in a bad way.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.039
He's a K Street lawyer down there.

27:38.139 --> 27:40.239
So the suit was only a suit?

27:40.440 --> 27:44.240
On the other hand, my friend,
this is from overseas.

27:44.839 --> 27:49.039
A can on the Adriatica, which docks
the day after tomorrow at Patapsco.

27:49.438 --> 27:51.339
Fake manifest out of Le Havre.

27:51.440 --> 27:53.139
You people got reach.

27:53.239 --> 27:56.339
That's about $300,000 in man-hours
we're holding here.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.940
What's the plan for him?

27:59.040 --> 28:02.239
You gotta call the US Attorney
about witness protection.

28:02.339 --> 28:04.739
We're rounding up his girl and kid.

28:04.839 --> 28:09.338
It's best we keep this as quiet as we can.
We already lost one cooperator.

28:28.639 --> 28:30.139
It's for you.

28:41.638 --> 28:42.837
Daniels.

28:42.938 --> 28:47.139
Lieutenant, Fitzhugh's calling for WITSEC,
and we're pulling in the girlfriend and kid.

28:47.239 --> 28:49.039
Okay, thanks.

29:31.837 --> 29:32.837
FBl.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.237
This is Special Agent Terrence Fitzhugh,
Baltimore field office.

29:36.337 --> 29:38.737
-May I speak with Agent Koutris, please?
-Who?

29:38.837 --> 29:40.337
Agent Koutris.

29:40.437 --> 29:43.437
He's no longer
with the San Diego field office.

29:43.538 --> 29:44.937
Where's he at?

29:45.037 --> 29:48.737
You could try headquarters in Washington.
Counterterrorism.

29:52.636 --> 29:54.937
Counterterrorism? For how long?

29:55.037 --> 29:59.536
I'd have to check, but I'm sure
he's been gone from here more than a year.

30:13.137 --> 30:17.037
Either he comes home
in the next five minutes, or I eat my gun.

30:19.736 --> 30:21.336
I'm just saying, this is not the way...

30:21.436 --> 30:23.736
me and you learned how to do it
in West Baltimore.

30:23.835 --> 30:25.836
Not by a fucking long shot!

30:44.236 --> 30:46.236
Either your son surrenders within the hour...

30:46.336 --> 30:49.535
or all the police will come
crashing through this door twice a day...

30:49.636 --> 30:52.735
for as long as it takes you people
to get the message. You hear me?

30:52.835 --> 30:56.835
We will take this door once in the morning
and once at night, and toss your house...

30:56.935 --> 31:00.135
until there isn't any furniture
with more than three legs left on it.

31:00.235 --> 31:04.335
Officer, my son turned himself in
to the police last night.

31:04.935 --> 31:08.536
At Southeastern.
A detective was there at the time.

31:16.735 --> 31:19.635
-A detective?
-Motherfucker. Come on.

31:26.535 --> 31:28.235
Don't use the phone.

31:28.335 --> 31:32.534
There'll be an agent posted outside.
If you go anywhere, go with him.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.134
What a dump.

31:44.634 --> 31:47.134
You wanted us to get a place, right?

31:53.934 --> 31:55.533
If they got to him in Philly...

31:55.633 --> 31:58.234
then they probably dumped
the body in that area, right?

31:58.334 --> 32:02.234
No use in dragging a headless torso around
further than you need.

32:02.334 --> 32:03.534
Good God.

32:04.634 --> 32:07.434
I bet you there's a police detective
somewhere else...

32:07.534 --> 32:09.834
Iooking at a table full of heads right now.

32:09.934 --> 32:13.933
In that stuff that we took off the ship,
did we keep any photos?

32:14.033 --> 32:16.734
Couple of pictures of one guy
that left his gear, yeah.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.334
They're at ECU.

32:22.233 --> 32:26.433
You two should get on the road.
Get up there before the offices close.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.133
Where y'all been at?

32:36.534 --> 32:39.333
I'm saying, though, Butchie,
something just ain't feel right.

32:39.433 --> 32:41.733
The man didn't even know
what I was saying.

32:41.833 --> 32:43.533
So I just eased off.

32:44.833 --> 32:47.333
-You think brother played me?
-No.

32:47.433 --> 32:50.732
Y'all can't read lying eyes
after all these years...

32:50.933 --> 32:53.332
then I'd be talking to a dead man.

32:54.032 --> 32:57.032
You saying Stringer told you...

32:57.933 --> 33:00.633
the brother had something to do
with your boy Brandon?

33:00.733 --> 33:01.732
Yeah.

33:01.832 --> 33:05.432
Near as I know, Brother Mouzone
spends most of his time up north.

33:05.532 --> 33:07.332
New York and Philly.

33:07.733 --> 33:11.932
If Avon contracted him to get at you...

33:13.232 --> 33:17.232
the brother wouldn't have stop coming
until you two were bumped.

33:17.832 --> 33:19.032
It's my fault.

33:19.132 --> 33:21.931
I should've said no to Prop Joe
from the get-go.

33:22.031 --> 33:25.332
Avon's father was plain evil,
and the son ain't no better.

33:25.532 --> 33:27.532
Neither is Stringer,
now that we making a list.

33:27.633 --> 33:29.832
I'm going hard after Stringer.

33:30.832 --> 33:34.132
No point in trying
to talk you back down, I suppose.

33:34.732 --> 33:38.531
You been my bank for how long
and gonna ask me something like that?

33:38.631 --> 33:40.532
How you gonna get at him?

33:42.932 --> 33:44.931
I don't even know, Butch.

33:45.931 --> 33:48.231
Take some time and think on it.

33:49.431 --> 33:53.231
One thing for sure, though,
the man got to be got, you feel me?

33:59.232 --> 34:00.932
What you see, Butch?

34:05.231 --> 34:06.731
Too much, boy.

34:07.431 --> 34:08.931
Too damn much.

34:17.431 --> 34:19.030
A lot happened overnight.

34:19.130 --> 34:20.429
Not to us.

34:20.530 --> 34:22.931
-Look, this isn't personal--
-Fucking-A, right.

34:23.031 --> 34:26.031
We're not even people in this unit.
We're your goddamn pack mules.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.331
"Sit on this house,
transport this mope, wait for that one."

34:29.431 --> 34:30.630
That's part of the job.

34:30.731 --> 34:34.231
The job had a little more rip-and-run to it,
the way I remember it.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.730
These cases are more than that.

34:36.830 --> 34:39.730
We're putting people in jail
with phone taps and typewriters.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.330
So you're saying we ain't up to it.

34:45.429 --> 34:48.830
I saw on the postings that Major Colvin
needs a sergeant in the Western.

34:48.929 --> 34:52.331
Flex squad.
And the last time I checked, I had stripes.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.929
Eastside, Westside.

35:04.130 --> 35:06.529
Cats and dogs, sleeping together.

35:13.329 --> 35:16.329
Shit. I'm late for something.

35:35.329 --> 35:38.829
You say you want everybody
that came on the port that day?

35:39.229 --> 35:42.629
No, we're looking for anything
out of the ordinary. Probably at night.

35:42.728 --> 35:45.329
Oh, unusual. You should've said so.

35:45.630 --> 35:48.729
-What you asked for before--
-That's what we....

35:49.130 --> 35:53.129
You're right, sir, absolutely right.
Just see if there's anything like that.

36:00.229 --> 36:03.128
Nope, all I got is usual.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.228
All right.
Any way you could give us the name...

36:05.328 --> 36:07.928
of the security officer
that was on this pier that night?

36:08.028 --> 36:10.028
What was that date again?

36:10.528 --> 36:12.028
February 5.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.529
You had the Atlantic Light on that pier
from 6:00 p.m.

36:20.028 --> 36:22.728
That was Walt. Walt Stokes.

36:22.828 --> 36:24.528
Is he working tonight?

36:24.628 --> 36:27.527
It's Tuesday. Walt's off on Tuesdays.

36:27.828 --> 36:29.227
What do you want Walt for?

36:29.327 --> 36:31.628
See if he can make any of these.

36:33.728 --> 36:35.328
Wouldn't do much good.

36:35.428 --> 36:38.728
Afraid Walt's not as up to speed
as the rest of us.

36:45.428 --> 36:47.727
Seeing as you've come
all this way, though...

36:47.827 --> 36:51.127
you might want to have a look-see
at the videotapes.

37:01.727 --> 37:03.527
$300 for a stroller?

37:04.326 --> 37:07.726
I know, I know.
Cost more than your first car, right?

37:08.026 --> 37:09.827
A hooptie, no doubt?

37:11.727 --> 37:14.127
We're so gonna need one of these.

37:17.527 --> 37:19.327
Look at this, Kima.

37:20.527 --> 37:22.626
Blue's Clues juice box holder.

37:23.527 --> 37:28.026
If the kid can't hold on to a little old box
without no help, we got problems.

37:37.527 --> 37:39.026
Okay, listen.

37:41.227 --> 37:46.126
This baby is gonna come out of my belly
and need both of us, forever.

37:46.927 --> 37:48.527
You understand?

37:48.926 --> 37:51.626
I mean, it may not be real for you yet.

37:52.726 --> 37:55.026
But, goddamn it, it's real for me.

38:24.825 --> 38:25.925
Nick.

38:31.525 --> 38:33.626
What's gonna happen, Nicky?

38:41.025 --> 38:42.725
That can on the fifth wheel there.

38:42.825 --> 38:46.225
By the plan, it's a hot box,
but there's no one on a pick-up.

38:46.325 --> 38:49.425
-Where's it from?
-Le Havre, France.

38:50.424 --> 38:52.324
Fuck it, then. Dump her.

39:03.525 --> 39:07.324
Lester, the drug talk coming
from Proposition Joe's people...

39:07.424 --> 39:09.224
before the warehouse phone came down.

39:09.324 --> 39:11.225
Those were for steady re-ups, right?

39:11.325 --> 39:14.824
We weren't up on that wire long,
but, yeah, three weeks in a row.

39:14.925 --> 39:18.724
-How much?
-Five or six La-Z-Boys at a clip, to start.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.624
Last call to Eton's cell phone,
the re-up went to 1 2.

39:23.324 --> 39:25.723
He doubles his re-up to 1 2 kilos?

39:31.324 --> 39:33.225
That's her right there.

39:34.524 --> 39:36.924
They ain't doing the dirt, though.

39:37.024 --> 39:39.824
Team leader,
keep an eye on that can till we post.

39:39.924 --> 39:41.124
Copy.

39:48.523 --> 39:50.923
Sorry to hear about my boy Sergei.

39:51.624 --> 39:52.923
Eton, too.

39:54.023 --> 39:56.023
You lost some good people.

39:58.723 --> 40:00.924
There'll be some new faces soon.

40:02.223 --> 40:04.524
A week or so. They'll find you.

40:05.523 --> 40:08.423
Just as they'll find the others
that work with us.

40:08.523 --> 40:09.623
A week?

40:11.123 --> 40:14.823
I ain't got enough of your good shit
to last much past that.

40:15.122 --> 40:18.023
You got anything to lay off
before you leave?

40:19.122 --> 40:21.123
The last shipment is lost.

40:21.523 --> 40:24.423
Lost? How you mean?

40:26.123 --> 40:29.023
The police may be sitting on it.

40:29.123 --> 40:30.623
You ain't sure?

40:31.023 --> 40:33.422
There's more where that came from.

40:33.923 --> 40:35.823
Always, there is more.

40:38.023 --> 40:39.523
All right, then.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.622
I'm gonna let your new people find me.

40:43.322 --> 40:45.022
Have a safe trip.

40:46.621 --> 40:48.922
Where you say you off to again?

41:02.622 --> 41:04.921
There's 1 2 in this, 15 in that.

41:05.422 --> 41:08.221
And if the rest of them
holds this same pattern....

41:08.321 --> 41:11.022
Maybe 200 kilos of raw left on the pier.

41:11.422 --> 41:14.021
The Greeks are definitely in the wind.

41:14.121 --> 41:16.021
And we are in the dark.

41:16.322 --> 41:18.821
You want us to take it down
to the customs shed, or what?

41:18.921 --> 41:20.822
No, you're gonna seal it up and sit on it.

41:20.922 --> 41:23.421
If we're lucky, someone will come
calling in a day or so.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.522
You that lucky?

41:24.622 --> 41:29.122
If they didn't get onto us when they did,
this might've been a hell of a case.

41:30.121 --> 41:31.521
It's on you.

41:36.721 --> 41:39.221
Ambushed? ln his own goddamn room?

41:39.820 --> 41:42.321
Yeah, he gonna be all right, but he--

41:42.421 --> 41:45.420
I don't give a fuck
about how he gonna be, man.

41:45.821 --> 41:48.121
You put on out-of-town talent
at a high price...

41:48.221 --> 41:50.621
you expect them
to get the motherfucking job done.

41:50.721 --> 41:53.121
He said that thing between us is....

41:53.221 --> 41:55.621
How did he put it? Absolved.

41:56.320 --> 41:59.021
Absolved? What the fuck do that mean?

41:59.521 --> 42:02.921
Mouzone booked out,
we worse off than when he came.

42:03.020 --> 42:05.520
If word gets out on the street
that we weak like this...

42:05.620 --> 42:07.621
how the fuck we supposed
to maintain our shit?

42:07.721 --> 42:10.320
I know, but we gotta hit right back,
make a statement.

42:10.420 --> 42:12.320
But Mouzone not saying who did this.

42:12.420 --> 42:14.520
-You asked him who it was?
-Yeah, I asked him.

42:14.619 --> 42:16.220
-Why?
-Why what?

42:19.121 --> 42:22.321
How you gonna ask a soldier like Mouzone
a question like that?

42:22.421 --> 42:24.920
Either he gonna say,
or he gonna go and work it out.

42:25.120 --> 42:28.120
Either way,
you ain't got to be asking him shit.

42:36.319 --> 42:39.619
Man, every market-based business
runs in cycles...

42:39.719 --> 42:41.919
and we going
through a down-cycle right now.

42:42.019 --> 42:46.119
String, this ain't about
your motherfucking business class either.

42:46.920 --> 42:50.420
It ain't that part of it. It's that other thing.

42:51.619 --> 42:54.719
The street is the street. Always.

43:01.020 --> 43:04.519
Man, we gonna get through
this bullshit anyway.

43:04.619 --> 43:07.419
No doubt.
You just need to hold tight till I get uptown.

43:07.519 --> 43:09.418
And that day gonna come, but until then...

43:09.518 --> 43:12.420
we gotta do what we can do,
when we can do it.

43:14.220 --> 43:16.619
Yeah, you need to go to Prop Joe.

43:17.219 --> 43:19.319
I ain't gonna argue with you.

43:19.419 --> 43:21.419
You run it as you see fit.

43:21.819 --> 43:24.019
At least until I get home, you do.

43:24.219 --> 43:25.419
No doubt.

43:29.618 --> 43:30.919
Us, man.

43:35.518 --> 43:36.518
Us.

43:48.318 --> 43:50.819
-Tape is fucked up.
-It's multiplexed.

43:51.518 --> 43:53.118
It's a way to save money.

43:53.218 --> 43:55.218
Instead of one camera, one VCR...

43:55.318 --> 43:57.418
it's 10 cameras playing on one VCR tape.

43:57.517 --> 44:00.418
-Can you make sense of it?
-Not a problem, with this software.

44:00.518 --> 44:03.017
-We just de-plex it.
-De-plex?

44:03.117 --> 44:05.318
Let me show you the highlight reel.

44:11.918 --> 44:14.918
-Is he flashing a badge?
-Looks like it.

44:15.018 --> 44:17.018
That's something you don't see too often...

44:17.118 --> 44:18.818
John Law in a Mercedes-Benz.

44:18.918 --> 44:20.718
That could be our boy.

44:20.817 --> 44:22.817
Head still on.

44:25.317 --> 44:27.817
Tell me we got cameras inside.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.117
Jesus, my pants are wet.

44:31.217 --> 44:33.417
Yeah. C'mon, baby.

44:34.216 --> 44:35.218
Yeah.

44:53.417 --> 44:55.816
Re-up gonna be about a week or so late.

44:55.916 --> 44:58.517
My people are having to readjust
to some shit.

44:58.617 --> 44:59.616
A week?

44:59.716 --> 45:01.816
No later than that, they say.

45:02.616 --> 45:04.717
How it go with Avon today?

45:06.117 --> 45:07.617
It's all good.

45:21.816 --> 45:23.516
Our old friend.

45:27.615 --> 45:28.915
What's the news?

45:29.015 --> 45:32.117
Port cops are sitting on a can
that came off the Adriatica.

45:32.216 --> 45:34.516
Word around the customs shed,
it's full of dope.

45:34.616 --> 45:36.116
I mean, about Frank.

45:36.216 --> 45:38.916
-What's the district council saying?
-Gentlemen.

45:40.916 --> 45:44.115
Mr. Pakusa, in light
of your pending indictment...

45:44.215 --> 45:47.215
I'd think you'd stay as far away
from this hall as possible.

45:47.315 --> 45:49.115
Ain't y'all got some place to go?

45:49.215 --> 45:50.815
Just came to make it clear...

45:50.915 --> 45:52.815
that if there's no cleaning up in here...

45:52.915 --> 45:54.515
this local will be decertified.

45:54.615 --> 45:57.015
Instead of your union
running out of this office...

45:57.114 --> 46:00.615
it'll be a federal magistrate
down the courthouse deciding things.

46:00.715 --> 46:03.216
Take the opportunity to elect new officers...

46:03.316 --> 46:05.615
or the US Attorney will padlock the door.

46:05.715 --> 46:08.115
And you'll be outside, looking in.

46:22.915 --> 46:25.614
One man, one vote.

46:42.514 --> 46:46.014
Did he have hands? Did he have a face?

46:46.114 --> 46:49.114
Yes? Then it wasn't us.

46:51.913 --> 46:54.715
You don't think that had anything to do...

46:55.714 --> 46:57.214
with this mope?

47:05.314 --> 47:07.914
You gotta do better than that, Lester.

47:08.114 --> 47:10.313
This poor guy ain't got a face.

47:24.114 --> 47:26.414
Did I mention the DNA matches?

47:28.014 --> 47:31.014
This has nothing to do with me.

47:47.613 --> 47:49.713
Is that the security guard?

47:51.913 --> 47:54.413
Walt Stokes. A good man.

47:55.413 --> 47:57.413
Keeps meticulous records.

47:59.113 --> 48:02.613
Bunk, they tell me
you can enhance each frame...

48:02.713 --> 48:04.413
to get a clear look.

48:04.813 --> 48:07.212
Yeah? Show it to me.

48:11.413 --> 48:14.612
I'll be damned. Maryland tags.

48:15.012 --> 48:17.412
Juliet-Lima-Yankee...

48:18.311 --> 48:19.813
5-4-5.

48:20.412 --> 48:22.913
That comes back to a BWI rental.

48:24.112 --> 48:26.013
I wonder who rented it.

48:27.512 --> 48:30.512
This is aggravated murder and kidnapping.

48:31.312 --> 48:34.312
In this state, it's a death penalty case.

48:37.612 --> 48:39.312
I didn't kill him.

48:42.912 --> 48:45.711
I was there, but I didn't kill him.

48:50.512 --> 48:52.312
Vondas did.

48:53.612 --> 48:55.211
He cut his throat.

48:57.312 --> 49:00.511
The shepherd was supposed
to watch over the women.

49:01.411 --> 49:04.311
Instead, he used them to make money.

49:05.611 --> 49:08.811
One of the women, she fought.
She was killed.

49:09.511 --> 49:13.911
And this idiot kills the rest
to make no witnesses.

49:14.011 --> 49:15.511
He had to die.

49:23.311 --> 49:25.611
You want a coffee? Soda?

49:26.211 --> 49:27.511
Vodka.

49:29.111 --> 49:30.311
Coffee.

49:43.211 --> 49:46.011
They're down. All 14 of them.

49:46.610 --> 49:49.710
Abated by the untimely death
of a known suspect.

49:49.910 --> 49:53.610
Plus another clearance
on a John Doe case, just for laughs.

49:54.010 --> 49:57.010
You wanna tell Rawls?

49:57.810 --> 49:59.910
Let him stew a while longer.

50:00.210 --> 50:02.710
One thing, though,
we should do right away.

50:13.710 --> 50:15.810
Who's the man above Vondas?

50:17.110 --> 50:18.410
The Greek.

50:19.110 --> 50:20.610
What's his name?

50:24.709 --> 50:27.909
You want a chance at anything
less than death row...

50:28.009 --> 50:29.509
you're gonna tell me right now...

50:29.609 --> 50:33.309
whatever it is you know
about where those bastards might be.

50:33.709 --> 50:37.109
A hotel at the harbor.

50:37.609 --> 50:38.810
This one?

50:40.710 --> 50:41.909
Another.

50:42.909 --> 50:44.409
I can show you.

51:01.808 --> 51:02.808
Go.

51:06.809 --> 51:08.409
Clear!

51:24.207 --> 51:26.108
Business or pleasure for you?

51:26.508 --> 51:29.108
Business. Always business.

51:44.008 --> 51:46.608
-What did you forget?
-Nothing important.

52:03.108 --> 52:04.908
You come to the bar without me?

52:05.008 --> 52:07.407
Kiss my black cat's sister's ass.

52:09.507 --> 52:11.707
-What happened?
-Case hit the wall.

52:11.807 --> 52:13.007
How so?

52:13.107 --> 52:15.707
The Sobotka nephew breaks for
the smuggling and the drugs.

52:15.807 --> 52:19.006
The Russian breaks for the murder
that fucking killed my girls.

52:19.206 --> 52:21.607
We were late on Vondopoulos
and The Greek.

52:21.707 --> 52:23.807
-How late?
-They skipped.

52:23.907 --> 52:27.606
We got interstate flight warrants out,
but from what the Sobotka kid says...

52:27.706 --> 52:29.006
these guys collect passports.

52:29.106 --> 52:31.907
We ain't even got a name
for The Greek yet, right?

52:32.407 --> 52:34.507
What're we doing
with the drug end of the case?

52:34.607 --> 52:37.606
I guess we could offer up Dixon
and Prop Joe to Narcotics.

52:37.707 --> 52:40.107
See if they want
to follow through on their end.

52:40.207 --> 52:41.407
I don't know.

52:41.507 --> 52:44.606
I wouldn't be so quick
to throw Joe back into the pond.

52:45.606 --> 52:49.406
A major case squad could have some fun
with that mess, don't you think?

53:03.807 --> 53:05.106
Lieutenant.

53:09.606 --> 53:11.406
I never told you this.

53:12.205 --> 53:15.206
In fact, if you tell anyone
I ever told you this...

53:15.306 --> 53:18.606
I'll finish my career
in fucking Montana or some shit.

53:20.106 --> 53:21.505
Excuse me, sorry.

53:25.405 --> 53:27.506
The leak wasn't your people.

53:28.306 --> 53:31.406
When I called around
looking for info on your targets...

53:31.506 --> 53:34.005
I used the FedCom software, you know?

53:34.405 --> 53:37.605
I thought I was talking
to some fuck in San Diego.

53:37.805 --> 53:39.905
The 9l1 1 boys in D.C.

53:40.905 --> 53:44.005
I'm guessing Vondopoulos
or The Greek was an asset to them.

53:44.105 --> 53:46.805
Hooked up like, I don't know,
who knows what?

53:54.005 --> 53:55.605
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

54:05.704 --> 54:08.005
World just keeps turning, right?

54:08.904 --> 54:12.304
You guys move on to something new.
No one looks back.

54:18.504 --> 54:20.303
It's on me this time.

54:23.105 --> 54:24.305
Anyone?

54:45.203 --> 54:46.903
Where are you going?

54:47.803 --> 54:48.903
Work.

55:14.603 --> 55:16.503
Frank, you cocksucker.

55:35.902 --> 55:38.402
-I can take it from here.
-You sure?

55:38.702 --> 55:41.102
No one fucks with us on our turf.

56:04.802 --> 56:07.902
Where the fuck else am I gonna go?
How's it looking?

56:08.002 --> 56:11.501
One ROIRO at North Point.
Graybeards grabbed that.

56:12.101 --> 56:14.102
Nothing else today, really.

56:14.503 --> 56:16.002
Seniority sucks.

56:16.602 --> 56:18.302
If you ain't senior.

56:20.602 --> 56:22.102
All right, man.

58:18.499 --> 58:20.599
This is a great day for Baltimore.
