00:08.708 --> 00:10.976
What, you never heard
of a girl who came home

00:10.978 --> 00:12.945
after being abducted
13 years ago?

00:12.947 --> 00:14.880
Who's that?
That is a blond-haired,

00:14.882 --> 00:16.482
blue-eyed piece
of raw sewage.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.883
I didn't get your name.

00:17.885 --> 00:18.817
Carter.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.119
Here we go.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.620
(whispering)
You like him?

00:21.622 --> 00:23.756
You're smart,
and you're nice.

00:23.758 --> 00:24.556
Beautiful.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.292
(Elizabeth)
You can never have anything
to do with him again.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.328
Do you understand me?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.698
Do you understand me?

00:37.137 --> 00:41.440
♪

00:41.442 --> 00:45.077
♪ You've got me lit up
with a look of love ♪

00:45.079 --> 00:46.478
Whoa... art.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.815
Wow... looks like a real
gallery opening.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.417
Feels like I should be
in the library,

00:51.419 --> 00:52.651
studying for Latin.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.386
I'll meet you
after.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.020
Tay, come on.

00:55.022 --> 00:57.556
Bird has a really big
piece in the show.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.390
Congratulate her
for me.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.492
She told me she wanted you
to be here.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.795
She wants everyone
to be here.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.196
Hey, you're here!

01:04.198 --> 01:05.230
(Ofe)
Hey, Carter's here.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.433
Carter... great,
you're here.

01:07.435 --> 01:08.901
Why does it matter
if I'm here?

01:08.903 --> 01:11.370
We don't know... Bird
said nothing could happen

01:11.372 --> 01:12.438
until you got here.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.939
Let's get some food.

01:13.941 --> 01:14.673
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.111
Somebody is dying
to meet you.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.714
So these people
aren't your friends?

01:22.716 --> 01:26.151
No, I'm not really part
of the artsy-fartsy crowd.

01:26.153 --> 01:29.288
Oh... well, we didn't
really have one of those

01:29.290 --> 01:29.955
at the school I went to.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.392
It was-- it was
more gunsy-knivesy.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.761
I'm not really part
of any crowd.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.696
I'm not too fond
of crowds myself.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.998
I feel like if you
pick right, you know,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
one's enough.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.536
You're surprisingly
quotable.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.473
I-- I read
a lot of T-shirts.

01:48.341 --> 01:49.341
This is Carter.

01:49.343 --> 01:51.343
Carter, this
is my art teacher,

01:51.345 --> 01:52.277
Ms. Freen.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.512
(Freen)
Hello.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.714
I think it's time.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.416
Are you ready?

01:57.418 --> 01:58.650
I think so.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.085
Everyone...
(claps hands)

02:00.087 --> 02:03.122
if you'll gather round,
please.

02:03.124 --> 02:08.060
I want to congratulate
all my wonderful artists.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.762
One of you chose
to wait

02:10.764 --> 02:12.431
to unveil her...

02:12.433 --> 02:15.868
well, I may be biased,
but I really do think

02:15.870 --> 02:18.370
it is a masterpiece.

02:18.372 --> 02:18.804
Bird.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.039
(applause)
Thank you, Ms. Freen.

02:21.041 --> 02:22.241
Now, I don't know
about "masterpiece,"

02:22.243 --> 02:25.477
but it is a tribute to
a very special friend of mine.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.114
I know most of you
probably know her story.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.983
Carter Stevens.

02:30.985 --> 02:33.452
(applause)

02:33.454 --> 02:36.788
Carter, you're an inspiration
to all of us.

02:36.790 --> 02:39.291
But especially me.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.493
You didn't know this,
but...

02:41.495 --> 02:43.462
you're my muse.

02:44.864 --> 02:47.399
(all murmuring in shock)

02:49.769 --> 02:52.337

No, I wouldn't say

03:40.888 --> 03:42.387

03:42.389 --> 03:42.821
I did.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.958
Kind of looks like
half her face is rotting away.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.593

in your kitchen.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.828
Oh, that sounds
so cool.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.698
Could we go by the high school
after dinner?

03:52.700 --> 03:53.332
I wanna see it.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.067
Well, you can't, 'cause
I had someone take it down.

03:55.069 --> 03:56.702
Pretty much just
snapped her fingers.

understand

03:57.638 --> 03:59.404

(Taylor)
Oh, poor you.

04:00.674 --> 04:01.740
Everyone knows
who you are.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.909
They clap when
they hear your name.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.444
You're a "muse."

04:05.446 --> 04:06.945
And do you think
I like that?

04:06.947 --> 04:09.314
Do you really think I want
that kind of attention?

04:09.316 --> 04:11.750
Well, I just don't really think
you'd like Invisible Land.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.285
All right, you know
what-- get back to me

04:13.287 --> 04:14.586
when the people you thought
were your friends

04:14.588 --> 04:17.789
start treating you
like a career move.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.025
Who wants
to change the subject?

04:20.027 --> 04:20.959
I do.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.595
You know, most people
think that humans

04:23.597 --> 04:24.863
descended from apes.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.398
When, actually,
we just share

04:26.400 --> 04:28.567
a common evolutionary
ancestor.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.335
So the African apes,
like the chimpanzees

04:30.337 --> 04:31.770
and the bonobos
and the gorillas,

04:31.772 --> 04:34.840
they're really
just our cousins.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.675
How cool is that?

04:39.178 --> 04:40.646
You said change
the subject.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.347
That's one of
my favorite subjects.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.682
That's why I was
offering it up.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.683
We can talk about it--

04:44.685 --> 04:45.384
We could talk about that.

04:45.386 --> 04:49.388
Or we could talk about
you two getting a car.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.455
(Taylor)
What?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.556
Um... yes?

04:51.558 --> 04:52.658
(laughing)
Are you serious?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.993
That's awesome...
I can't compete with that.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.028
That's great-- we'll
just look into it

04:56.030 --> 04:57.729
to see how we can
make that happen.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.831
Ah, it'll be used.
Nothing fancy.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.600
No, it doesn't
have to be fancy!

05:01.602 --> 05:03.335
You can start
with this.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.336
Give me a page.

05:04.338 --> 05:07.439
Okay, we'll circle
the ones that we like.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.308
(giggling)
Ah, it's great
to see those two

05:09.310 --> 05:10.842
getting along like that,
isn't it?

05:10.844 --> 05:13.779
Oh, I'm sorry, you care
about what I think?

05:13.781 --> 05:16.948
Because it doesn't
feel like you do.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.218
If I'm not back
in two days,

05:20.220 --> 05:22.587
send a search party.

05:25.158 --> 05:28.126
That's a strange thing
to say in this house.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.530
Strange...
yet typical.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.399
I'm looking for ways
to help them bond.

05:34.401 --> 05:35.767
Carter's been home
a little while.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.069
They still seem
like strangers.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.371
I... thought if they
had to share a car--

05:39.373 --> 05:41.740
It's a great idea...
I agree with you.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.575
But we can't make it
happen right now.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.810
Lizzy, I'm talking
about a clunker.

05:44.812 --> 05:48.480
We can't even afford
the cars we already have.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.048
As it happens,
I'm expecting

05:50.050 --> 05:52.184
a rather large
paycheck.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.352
What? Great!

05:53.354 --> 05:54.720
Why don't you
tell me these things?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.822
I don't even know what
you're working on.

05:56.824 --> 05:57.456
That's my process.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.523
Too many things
have fallen though.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.460
I don't like to talk about
something unless it's real.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.062
And...
this check is real?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.997
This check is real.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.933
When's it coming in?

06:07.935 --> 06:08.867
Soon, very soon.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.769
But the point is,
you don't have to get

06:10.771 --> 06:12.170
bent out of shape
at the idea

06:12.172 --> 06:13.839
of buying
the girls a used car.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.240
I definitely
will feel better

06:15.242 --> 06:16.375
if we have some more money
coming in.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.410
Oh, you'll feel better.
A lot better.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.212
A whole new level
of better.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.646
Okay, stop taunting me.

06:21.648 --> 06:23.148
Why can't
you just tell me?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.584
'Cause it's so much fun
to taunt you.

06:30.123 --> 06:34.393
(students chattering)

06:37.663 --> 06:40.031
I bet you she came back
in the middle of the night

06:40.033 --> 06:41.099
and put it back up.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.035
No, she wouldn't dare.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.838
See? Told ya.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.559
You were saying?

07:19.338 --> 07:21.973
Carter...
Carter, stop!

07:21.975 --> 07:23.408
You have
to go to class.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.544
This is gonna
take all day.

07:26.312 --> 07:27.312
Possibly longer.

07:27.314 --> 07:30.348
It's like this
on every floor.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.217
You haven't
seen the gym.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.923
I don't get it.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.792
Why would she even paint
something so horrible

07:40.794 --> 07:43.028
in the first place?

07:43.030 --> 07:44.796
And now this?

07:46.098 --> 07:47.833
I thought
she was my friend.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.067
(school bell rings)

07:49.069 --> 07:51.303
Hey, you guys go.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.138
I'll help her.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.072
Thank you, Gabe.

07:54.074 --> 07:58.577
You'll never get this done
at the rate you're going.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.683
(paper tearing)

08:08.955 --> 08:10.622
<i>No problemo.</i>

08:10.624 --> 08:12.591
Give me something
hard to do.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.795
(squeak)

08:19.765 --> 08:22.467
Ohh...

08:22.469 --> 08:23.568
Oh, no.

08:23.570 --> 08:26.137
(whispering)
What the hell?

08:26.672 --> 08:29.975
Okay, okay,
I can fix this.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.676
Max?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.745
Hey...
Hey.

08:33.747 --> 08:36.548
Are you doing
our laundry?

08:36.550 --> 08:38.083
Yeah.

08:38.085 --> 08:41.520
I wanted to show you guys
how much I appreciate...

08:41.522 --> 08:42.153
everything.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.489
You know, letting me
stay here and...

08:44.491 --> 08:46.224
That is so sweet.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.528
So-- so keep that
in mind when you--

08:51.097 --> 08:54.165
Um...

08:54.167 --> 08:56.167
this happened how?

08:56.169 --> 08:59.671
Forgot to check
all my pockets.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.172
Some candy
that was--

09:01.174 --> 09:02.807
That's just chocolate.

09:02.809 --> 09:03.475
I just-- I--

09:03.477 --> 09:05.010
Well, you know what?
I can just redo 'em.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.778
No, no, no.
No, no. Thank you.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.313
It's just--
it's better off

09:08.315 --> 09:09.981
if you just stay away

09:09.983 --> 09:13.618
from the washing machine
altogether.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.120
I'm sorry.

09:15.122 --> 09:15.620
(sighs)

09:15.622 --> 09:18.857
It's okay, I know your heart
was in the right place.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.593
Yeah, I'm...

09:21.595 --> 09:23.962
I'm probably not.

09:27.934 --> 09:30.201
What do you mean?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.437
Just clearly not
the ideal house guest,

09:32.439 --> 09:37.208
and I think this is a sign
it's time for me to go.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.778
Well, Max, I really
liked having you here.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.213
I mean, the last five minutes
haven't been great,

09:42.215 --> 09:44.482
but the--
most of the time...

09:44.484 --> 09:48.353
I've gotten totally spoiled
by Taylor's cooking.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.788
And Grant...

09:49.790 --> 09:52.724
he's like
my best friend now.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.059
But I think...

09:54.061 --> 09:56.328
you can stop worrying
about Carter.

09:56.330 --> 09:59.631
I mean, she has friends here,
she has family.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.268
Does she know that?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.103
Not yet.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.472
But she'll figure it out.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.608
(chuckles softly)

10:11.010 --> 10:14.279
I'm really gonna
miss you.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.880
Are you, though?

10:15.882 --> 10:17.015
No.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.651
(chuckles)

10:19.653 --> 10:21.953
Yes.

10:24.890 --> 10:26.224
Whew!

10:26.226 --> 10:27.926
Well, that was tough.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.794
But I think
we got 'em all.

10:29.796 --> 10:32.330
Hey...
Yeah?

10:32.332 --> 10:33.832
Thank you.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.567
Yeah.

10:47.346 --> 10:49.414
You're welcome.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.162
Oh, my...

11:06.666 --> 11:07.532
(sighs)

11:07.534 --> 11:09.868
Bird! Did you see
where she went?

11:09.870 --> 11:13.138
Bird!
Oh, for...

11:13.140 --> 11:13.672
Excuse me...

11:13.674 --> 11:15.807
Did you see where she went,
the girl who put these up?

11:15.809 --> 11:17.342
You can't just
leave them up here.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.110
You're gonna take them
down, right?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.812
Oh, my God.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.247
(whispering)

11:22.249 --> 11:23.214
What's the matter?

11:23.216 --> 11:27.719
Did the world stop revolving
around you for one second?

11:28.320 --> 11:30.221
Bird, I thought
you were my friend.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.723
I just spent
six hours...

11:31.725 --> 11:33.291
I thought
you were mine!

11:33.293 --> 11:35.560
And nothing?
I got a kiss.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.862
A kiss? She kissed you
when she wasn't high?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.130
You're out
of the friend zone.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.332
You're moving the ball
down the field.

11:41.334 --> 11:45.704
No, it was a kiss,
but it wasn't a <i>kiss.</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:46.905
You know what I mean?

11:46.907 --> 11:47.605
Actually, no.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.174
(Bird)
Stop ripping them!

11:49.176 --> 11:50.975
I'll do it.

11:50.977 --> 11:51.976
Stop!
Get off!

11:51.978 --> 11:53.945
No, get off of me,
you bully, you!

11:53.947 --> 11:55.346
(overlapping shouting)

11:55.348 --> 11:57.515
Let me explain myself!
It's humiliating!

11:57.517 --> 11:58.750
What are you
talking about?

11:58.752 --> 12:01.219
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

12:03.656 --> 12:04.889
What are you
talking about?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.558
Do you even know
what that means?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.125
Bird!

12:07.127 --> 12:09.427
All I wanted was
a nice little

12:09.429 --> 12:10.562
student art exhibit.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.733
You girls
are not the show.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.301
Stop making it about you.

12:16.303 --> 12:20.138
And... get this place
cleaned up.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.806
Your work here
is done.

12:21.808 --> 12:24.509
Okay.
You two,
go home.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.711
I'm sorry.

12:41.026 --> 12:44.062
I spent six hours
taking these down.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.897
Don't bitch at me.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.967
I was here all night
putting them up.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.975
Yeah, I'd be
mad at me, too.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.578
Really?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.814

Yeah, that...

15:04.004 --> 15:05.670
Come back.

15:07.139 --> 15:08.306
I will.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.241
Soon.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.709
Okay.

15:14.613 --> 15:15.680
Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

15:23.389 --> 15:26.157
Why are we all talking
in this weird voice?

15:26.159 --> 15:27.892
(scoffs)

15:32.398 --> 15:34.165
(sighs)

15:34.733 --> 15:35.867
Hey, Carter, it's me.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.169
Sorry, I couldn't stick
around to say good-bye,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.238
but you know I suck
at good-byes.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.140
But, uh, but this
isn't good-bye,

15:42.142 --> 15:43.408
'cause I'll see you soon.

15:43.410 --> 15:47.045
So, um... anyway,
hey, never change.

15:47.047 --> 15:48.313
All right?

15:48.315 --> 15:50.014
Bye.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.558
Hey...

16:00.560 --> 16:01.793
Please move.

16:01.795 --> 16:02.593
It's you, isn't it?

16:02.595 --> 16:04.228
You're blocking my door.
I have to go.

16:04.230 --> 16:06.030
Lori, I know it's you.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.440
Hi, Max.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.983
My disguise <i>du jour.</i>

16:24.985 --> 16:26.217
Obviously,
not a very good one.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.487
Just... really sick
of wearing wigs.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.456
Isn't it dangerous
for you to be here?

16:31.458 --> 16:34.158
It's dangerous for me
to be anywhere.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.461
At least here,
I could see her.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.730
How is she?

16:38.732 --> 16:40.365
She's Carter.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.567
You know, she is
who she wants to be

16:42.569 --> 16:45.169
whenever she wants
to be it.

16:45.171 --> 16:47.205
You know what I mean?

16:47.207 --> 16:48.673
I do.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.343
The thing I'm most
proud of in this world

16:52.345 --> 16:55.513
is being her mother.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.915
I miss being
her mother.

16:59.785 --> 17:03.755
She refuses to call
Elizabeth that.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.990
(laughing)

17:05.992 --> 17:08.726
I'll be that drives
Elizabeth insane.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.495
Nah, she--
she gets it.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.197
She just wants Carter
to be happy.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.500
She let her
keep that name,

17:15.502 --> 17:17.502
even though
it's not her real one.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.270
Yes, it is.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.672
Although she will
have to change it

17:21.674 --> 17:24.375
when we're back together.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.711
What, you mean you're
getting back together?

17:26.713 --> 17:29.013
Of course, Max--
what did you think?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.782
You mean--
but when?

17:30.784 --> 17:32.583
I mean, how are--
how are you gonna do it?

17:32.585 --> 17:33.518
I'm-- I'm working on it.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.620
I-I-- It's taken
longer than I wanted.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.755
I couldn't
believe the red tape

17:37.757 --> 17:39.190
to get a new identity.

17:39.192 --> 17:39.791
Fingers crossed,

17:39.793 --> 17:41.259
I'll have everything set
in the next two weeks,

17:41.261 --> 17:42.727
and she can leave
all of this behind,

17:42.729 --> 17:44.662
like the nightmare
I'm sure it's been.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.331
But she can't know
any of this... okay?

17:47.333 --> 17:48.766
Including that you
saw me.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.369
Not until
everything's ready.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.870
Promise me.

17:52.872 --> 17:55.273
I promise.

17:55.275 --> 17:58.543
Listen, you gotta
be more careful.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.444
I mean,
if I can run into you,

17:59.446 --> 18:03.214
that means anybody can--
that's including Carter.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.348
Yeah, well...

18:04.350 --> 18:06.284
Max, you didn't
exactly run into me.

18:06.286 --> 18:09.587
I kind of...
followed you.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.256
From where?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.927
From the house?

18:15.929 --> 18:17.395
Lori, you were
right outside their house?

18:17.397 --> 18:21.065
I know I'm pushing it,
it's just...

18:21.067 --> 18:22.733
every day is harder.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.202
You think it's gonna
get easier,

18:24.204 --> 18:25.403
but it doesn't.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.271
And if it's like this
for me, what must it

18:27.273 --> 18:28.840
be like for her,
I ju--

18:28.842 --> 18:32.009
I can't stand the thought
of her suffering.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.180
I wouldn't...

18:36.182 --> 18:39.050
I wouldn't say
she's suffering.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.551
It's okay, Max.

18:40.553 --> 18:41.586
(sniffles)

18:41.588 --> 18:43.955
All that matters...

18:43.957 --> 18:47.091
is that
this is almost over.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.496

18:53.699 --> 18:56.334

19:05.410 --> 19:06.911
Wow...
(chuckles)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.613
Doesn't look like
anyone even lives here.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.382
Ah, that's the look
my parents are going for.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.217
Tasteful abandonment.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.185
So they're not here?

19:14.187 --> 19:16.354
Ah, let me check.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.790
Ah, money in an envelope
usually means

19:19.792 --> 19:24.195
they're out of town, and...

19:24.197 --> 19:24.996
(sighs)

19:24.998 --> 19:26.731
Judging by the amount,
looks like

19:26.733 --> 19:29.800
they're gonna
be gone for a while.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.871
Um, do you want
to order something?

19:33.873 --> 19:34.972
Sure.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.342
At my house, this
qualifies as a cookbook.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.145
Okay, we have
Chinese...

19:41.147 --> 19:44.315
American...
Italian...

19:44.317 --> 19:46.083
Don't you get lonely?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.418
Lonely?

19:47.420 --> 19:50.621
Well, I have
my two best friends.

19:50.623 --> 19:54.225
Vodka... and fudge.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.560
Okay, you know what?

19:55.562 --> 19:57.695
We're going
to my place.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.430

19:59.432 --> 20:00.598

20:12.712 --> 20:14.879

that cheese but you.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.080
That was the plan, Stan.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.749

20:23.756 --> 20:26.224
Sure...
Yeah, there's plenty.

Hello again.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.725

that painted

20:27.727 --> 20:29.460
that picture
of Carter, right?

20:29.462 --> 20:30.328
Yeah.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.129
Oh, that was you?

20:32.131 --> 20:32.830
Oh, that was
so cool.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.733
Can you paint a picture

20:35.735 --> 20:36.901
I'd love that so much.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.035
Oh, my first commission.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.004
Hey, thanks for coming
to the show, by the way.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.672

you knew I was there.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.908

20:45.712 --> 20:46.711
Who's that?

20:46.713 --> 20:47.545
J-May?
"John Mayer"?

20:47.547 --> 20:50.414
Don't you think Max looks
exactly like John Mayer?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.783
Good for you, girl.
He is super-fine.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.819
Did something happen
with you and Max?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.621
What's going on
with you and Max?

20:56.623 --> 20:57.722
No, nothing, stop!

20:57.724 --> 21:01.259
I liked it better when
he thought I didn't exist.

21:01.261 --> 21:04.228
Oh... mm.
This looks good.

21:04.230 --> 21:08.065
Okay... everyone's responsible
for their own cheese.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.500
(Carter)
Can we eat?
I'm starving.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.701
No, we have to wait
for your father.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.003
No need!
Where have
you been?

21:12.005 --> 21:16.007
I have been dealing
with a transportation issue.

21:16.009 --> 21:16.974
Ohh.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.843
No...

21:18.845 --> 21:19.910
Tay...

21:19.912 --> 21:21.412
No!
No!

21:21.414 --> 21:22.413
(Carter)
Yes? Okay.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.482
(Taylor)
Are you serious?
Let's go see!

21:24.484 --> 21:26.684
I call shotgun.
No, way, let's go see!

21:26.686 --> 21:28.986
Come on.
Oh, my God,
this is...

21:28.988 --> 21:30.354
You're very lucky.

21:30.356 --> 21:31.589
You have a great family.

21:31.591 --> 21:34.859
Yeah, well, you came
on a good night.

21:35.994 --> 21:39.196
So does this mean
that you got that check?

21:39.198 --> 21:40.031
Uh, not yet.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.166
David...
But soon.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.301
Define soon.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.270
Soon is... soon.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.839
Unless "soon"
means "now,"

21:48.841 --> 21:51.609
we have a problem.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.977
This is our bank balance.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.680
Come, take a look.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.948
You see this number?

21:57.950 --> 21:59.116
Is that enough
to pay for the car

21:59.118 --> 22:01.819
that you brought home
tonight?

22:03.588 --> 22:05.256
No.
Okay...

22:05.258 --> 22:07.024
So then, now...

22:07.026 --> 22:08.459
this number no longer
exists.

22:08.461 --> 22:12.163
Now, I can't pay for
our mortgage or electric bill,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.264
credit card bill,
water bill.

22:13.266 --> 22:18.169
So do you see how "soon"
doesn't really help us now?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.404
You don't have
to be sarcastic.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.672
I don't know
what I have to be

22:21.674 --> 22:26.043
to get you to understand
that we can't afford this car.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.646
You have to return it.

22:28.648 --> 22:29.480
I can't, it's used.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.515
I'd get pennies
on the dollar.

22:31.517 --> 22:33.851
Oh, my God.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.853
But if you could
just trust me...

22:35.855 --> 22:37.988
that things are
gonna be fine.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.657
Can you do that?

22:44.396 --> 22:46.130
So here we are again.
No.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.865
You said that I would
never have to make this call.

22:47.867 --> 22:50.568
You don't have to.
And I won't.

22:50.570 --> 22:51.202
I won't, David.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.570
Just give me something,
anything.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.071
Just tell me
what you're working on,

22:54.073 --> 22:56.707
and I won't ask
another thing from you.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.076
What are you writing?

23:04.483 --> 23:07.818
It hurts that you don't
believe in me.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.120
Well, David...

23:09.122 --> 23:11.222
it hurts you think
that belongs

23:11.224 --> 23:14.825
on top of the list
of things that hurt.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.668
(phone beeps)

23:27.973 --> 23:32.143
Hey, Mom...
it's me.

23:37.215 --> 23:41.051
So, have you, uh,
remembered anything else?

23:41.053 --> 23:44.088
Besides me,
your old Pop-Pop?

23:44.090 --> 23:46.090
(chuckles)
No, not really.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.092
Guess I'm kind of
starting over.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.293
She's doing very well.

23:49.295 --> 23:50.428
She's making
all these new friends,

23:50.430 --> 23:53.998
and she's very much
the social butterfly.

23:54.000 --> 23:54.965
Good!

23:54.967 --> 23:56.167
I'm glad to hear that.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.702
This one always
has her nose in a book.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.571
You're only young
once, you know.

24:00.573 --> 24:03.207
(Buddy)
Unless they're like you...

24:03.209 --> 24:04.341
who's forever young.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.644
Oh, please, Buddy.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.446
You know, I'm gonna
give you the name

24:08.448 --> 24:09.780
of my dermatologist.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.916
Mom, I have
a dermatologist.

24:11.918 --> 24:13.617
Ah... oh...

24:13.619 --> 24:15.186
Wouldn't have known.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.122
Well, I'm, uh...

24:18.124 --> 24:21.225
sorry that David
couldn't join us today.

24:21.227 --> 24:21.892
He probably could.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.427
Just afraid
to show his face.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.029
Mom, please.
Sorry, kids.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.431
Sometimes, I'm so
used to speaking my mind,

24:27.433 --> 24:29.166
I forget I'm supposed
to be polite.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.435
There is a lot
to be said, though,

24:31.437 --> 24:34.138
for being free to speak
your mind.

24:35.407 --> 24:39.243
Dad, the kids probably
would love a golf cart ride.

24:39.245 --> 24:39.977
Oh!

24:39.979 --> 24:41.846
Yeah, that sounds fun.

24:41.848 --> 24:43.414
Well, let's do it.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.749
Wow, never thought
I'd see the day

24:45.751 --> 24:46.851
I felt sorry
for Elizabeth.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.186
If you really want
to make Grandma happy,

24:49.188 --> 24:51.188
call her "Gammy."

24:51.890 --> 24:55.125
Well, listen, thanks
for lunch, Gammy.

24:55.127 --> 24:57.161
Oh! "Gammy"?

24:58.630 --> 25:00.664
She called me Gammy!
I heard.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.567
That was your baby name
for me-- Gammy!

25:03.569 --> 25:05.269
You remembered Gammy!

25:05.271 --> 25:06.704
Gammy and Pop-Pop.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.272
Oh, this is
my moment, okay?

25:08.274 --> 25:09.874
You had yours.
Let me have mine.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.009
All right,
let's let Gammy

25:12.011 --> 25:15.346
have her moment.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.182
Mom, that's so sweet.

25:18.184 --> 25:20.451
I am so glad that we
came to see you today.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.520
Oh, me, too.
Me, too.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.121
My head is so dizzy,
I forgot what we

25:24.123 --> 25:25.523
were gonna talk about.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.058
Um...

25:28.060 --> 25:30.761
David and I thought
that the-- the girls

25:30.763 --> 25:31.962
should have a car.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.731
Oh... oh, absolutely.
Absolutely.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.599
Nothing fancy.
Something used.

25:35.601 --> 25:36.534
Oh, don't be
ridiculous.

25:36.536 --> 25:38.469
They're gonna
want something...

25:38.471 --> 25:39.036
kicky and fun.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.071
You know, I'll put
the money in your account,

25:41.073 --> 25:43.974
but you let them
pick it out.

25:43.976 --> 25:47.111
That's very generous, Mom.
Thank you.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.446
And tell 'em
it's from Gammy.

25:50.782 --> 25:52.983
(knock on door)

25:52.985 --> 25:55.719
(typing)

25:56.388 --> 25:57.555
(knock on door)

25:57.557 --> 25:59.223
Come in.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.258
I just wanted to let you
know that it's done.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.161
I even got us
a little breathing room.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.896
She's sending us money
for a new car.

26:05.898 --> 26:08.499
But if she ever asks,
I'll just tell her

26:08.501 --> 26:09.500
that the girls
preferred a car

26:09.502 --> 26:12.836
they didn't have to worry
about if it got dinged.

26:12.838 --> 26:13.437
(sighs)

26:13.439 --> 26:16.006
Well, you'll be able
to pay them back soon.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.274
Please... I'm sorry.

26:17.276 --> 26:21.445
I just need you to stop
saying the word "soon."

26:23.448 --> 26:26.450
Lizzy, I can see
I'm pushing buttons here.

26:26.452 --> 26:27.885
I'm not trying to.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.853
I'm hyper-aware

26:29.855 --> 26:31.488
that I've not been
pulling my weight around here.

26:31.490 --> 26:32.389
Not for a long time.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.657
I've never brought that up.

26:33.659 --> 26:34.558
No, I appreciate that.
I do.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.427
But I've been
working hard, very hard.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.496
Things have fallen through.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.765
I've lost confidence
in myself,

26:41.767 --> 26:43.200
and I know...

26:43.202 --> 26:45.703
I know I became
less appealing to you.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.305
David...
I want
to make it up to you.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.040
It's all I've been
thinking about.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.076
And I'm about to,
very close.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.677
Buying the car,
that's what that was about.

26:53.679 --> 26:55.679
I was feeling good
about myself again.

26:55.681 --> 26:58.048
More than anything,
I was hoping that

26:58.050 --> 27:00.618
that would...

27:00.620 --> 27:06.190
help how you feel
about me.

27:06.192 --> 27:11.662
I'm happy that you feel
good about yourself.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.897
It's just...

27:13.899 --> 27:16.667
the way you talk about me,

27:16.669 --> 27:20.638
it doesn't sound like
I'm your wife.

27:20.640 --> 27:26.710
It sounds like
I'm your accountant.

27:26.712 --> 27:28.112
Okay, well, I, um...

27:28.114 --> 27:30.280
I'm gonna go to work
for a little bit,

27:30.282 --> 27:32.016
clean up some paperwork.

27:33.284 --> 27:34.785
Okay.

27:36.855 --> 27:39.757
I'll see you when
you get home.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.259
(whispers)
Yeah.

27:43.561 --> 27:44.428
(indistinct chatter)

27:44.430 --> 27:46.196
You got it.
You got it.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.366
Thanks man.

27:50.435 --> 27:52.569
(phone ringing)

27:52.571 --> 27:53.804
Hey.

27:53.806 --> 27:54.171
Hey.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.906
You're not supposed
to be here.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.275
Paperwork.

27:59.077 --> 28:01.178
Seems like you want
to be alone.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.913
I do, thanks.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.751
You know,
I just want to say...

28:07.753 --> 28:10.220
before we were anything,

28:10.222 --> 28:12.756
we were friends.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.793

30:28.594 --> 30:30.327
and Grant's holed up
in his room,

30:30.329 --> 30:31.361
binge-watching "Lost."

30:31.363 --> 30:32.296
Oh, do that
kid a favor.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.998
Just go in there and say,
"They're dead."

30:35.000 --> 30:36.099
(laughter)

30:36.101 --> 30:37.501
Save him
a lot of heartache.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.602
(laughter)
God!

30:38.604 --> 30:39.503
I'm not kidding.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.905
So you're like throwing
a whole dinner party for us.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.707
Yeah, thanks, Tay.

30:43.709 --> 30:44.508
I didn't invite anyone.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.577
I... thought maybe
you you did.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.045
Mm, no, it wasn't me.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.680
It was me.
Yeah, it was me.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.448
So this
is your dinner party.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.917
Except it's at our house,
and we cooked.

30:53.919 --> 30:56.053
By "we" you mean me.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.888
(door opens)
Yes.

30:57.890 --> 30:58.589
(laughter)

30:58.591 --> 31:00.390
Hope there's room
for one more.

31:00.392 --> 31:01.758
(all)
Max!

31:01.760 --> 31:04.728
Well, that was a lot better
than the greeting I got at home.

31:04.730 --> 31:05.429
Totally J-May.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.331
(snickers)
What are you doing here?

31:07.333 --> 31:08.932
I just got your
good-bye message.

31:08.934 --> 31:11.568
No, no, I said
it wasn't good-bye.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.070
And it's not, I'm...

31:13.072 --> 31:14.304
actually, I'm moving here.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.240
You are?
Really?
That's so cool.

31:16.242 --> 31:17.441
I don't know, well,
my parents,

31:17.443 --> 31:19.142
they said I could
live wherever I want,

31:19.144 --> 31:20.477
as long as I
support myself,

31:20.479 --> 31:23.213
so I thought,
why not see if there's

31:23.215 --> 31:24.414
a job around here?

31:24.416 --> 31:25.315
And there was.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.384
So I'm a manager now.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.220
Yeah, over at the Quick-n-Easy
off of Route 7.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.555
Wait, they made you
manager already?

31:31.557 --> 31:33.590
Yeah, well, the guy
who owns the place,

31:33.592 --> 31:34.625
he's super nice.

31:34.627 --> 31:37.394
He tells everyone
they're the manager.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.795
Oh...

31:38.797 --> 31:39.863
Where you gonna stay?

31:39.865 --> 31:41.798
I was hoping
I could stay here.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.033
Just for tonight--
I mean, I'll look

31:43.035 --> 31:44.568
for something tomorrow,
if that's cool.

31:44.570 --> 31:46.336
Yeah, sure.
Of course.

31:46.338 --> 31:47.104
Course it's okay.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.740
I want to
sleep over, too.

31:49.742 --> 31:52.309
Oh, um... sure.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.077
Okay.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.680
What?

31:56.682 --> 31:57.915
I feel left out.

31:57.917 --> 31:58.715
What about us?

31:58.717 --> 32:00.951
Do you feel
left out?
Yeah, a little bit.

32:00.953 --> 32:02.552
We all could sleep over.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.554
Um... yeah.

32:04.556 --> 32:05.822
That's be fun.

32:05.824 --> 32:07.891
When did this
become her house?

32:08.426 --> 32:09.626
Seriously,
you'd understand

32:09.628 --> 32:10.327
if you saw her house.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.596
Okay, wait... you still
have to let me set this up.

32:12.598 --> 32:13.530
Okay?
I'm really good at this.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.632
I just need all the sheets
you have in the house.

32:15.634 --> 32:19.102
Oh... they're in
the hallway closet upstairs.

32:19.104 --> 32:19.736
Yeah, I'll show her.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.772

move the furniture?
