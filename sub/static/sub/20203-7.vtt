00:05.806 --> 00:09.277
**

00:09.277 --> 00:11.812
The year was 1968

00:11.812 --> 00:16.850
and America was still reeling
from three major assassinations

00:16.850 --> 00:20.054
and an ongoing war in Vietnam.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.955
* I just sit here every day *

00:21.955 --> 00:23.991
* Wondering what you
have to say *

00:23.991 --> 00:27.295
But Playboy was keeping up
with the tumultuous times...

00:27.295 --> 00:30.064
running articles about
politics...

00:30.064 --> 00:31.165
race...

00:31.165 --> 00:33.401
and social justice.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.936
Soon the magazine was earning
a reputation

00:35.936 --> 00:39.273
as the voice of the young,
progressive movement

00:39.273 --> 00:41.109
that was sweeping the country.

00:45.079 --> 00:49.483
Hef did a great job
of evolving the magazine

00:49.483 --> 00:53.254
from the '50s suit,
dinner jacket,

00:53.254 --> 00:55.723
cocktail version of Playboy

00:55.723 --> 00:59.660
to the '60s Summer of Love
version of Playboy.

00:59.660 --> 01:04.232
He was always ready
to adapt the magazine

01:04.232 --> 01:06.500
to what was going on in culture.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.304
Most of the time
he was already very far ahead

01:10.304 --> 01:11.739
of where the culture was going.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.644
As we evolved...

01:16.644 --> 01:18.346
readership continued to boom.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.482
And by the end of the 1960s,

01:21.482 --> 01:25.286
one in four college men
subscribed to Playboy.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.391
But just because the magazine
had matured

01:30.391 --> 01:33.261
didn't mean we took ourselves
too seriously.

01:33.261 --> 01:36.764
My new TV show,
Playboy After Dark,

01:36.764 --> 01:39.267
showed that,
at the end of the day,

01:39.267 --> 01:41.101
we were still about having fun.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.637
**

01:46.174 --> 01:50.311
Playpen After Dark!
with your host...

01:50.311 --> 01:53.214
In its first year,
the show was popular enough

01:53.214 --> 01:54.982
to be spoofed
by Johnny Carson.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.084
Each week I'm here on the show

01:57.084 --> 02:00.754
to kinda break down
ancient sex beliefs, you know,

02:00.754 --> 02:06.260
combat puritan morality and get
my hands on some good stuff.

02:09.997 --> 02:14.001
Between filming Playboy After
Dark in L.A.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.736
and traveling around the world

02:15.736 --> 02:19.340
to meet with Playboy Club
managers and magazine editors,

02:19.340 --> 02:21.141
I was always in the air

02:21.141 --> 02:24.812
and barely spending any time
in my Chicago home.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.982
So I decided it was time
to bring the Playboy mansion...

02:28.982 --> 02:31.352
to the skies.

02:34.488 --> 02:38.292
* Every little movement *

02:38.292 --> 02:42.263
* Every little thing
you do *

02:42.263 --> 02:45.433
* Is it sleight of hand *

02:45.433 --> 02:50.371
* That commands my heart
to love you? *

02:50.371 --> 02:54.408
* Every little movement *

02:54.408 --> 02:58.212
* Every
little movement **

03:07.821 --> 03:10.324
In the spring of 1968,

03:10.324 --> 03:14.662
I tasked my executive
assistant, Dick Rosenzweig,

03:14.662 --> 03:17.498
with an ambitious project.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.368
Hef came to me one day

03:20.368 --> 03:23.904
and he said he needed
a private aircraft.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.807
And he wanted
a very special one.

03:29.009 --> 03:32.480
He said the plane
should be painted black...

03:32.480 --> 03:35.316
because there is no other
black plane out there,

03:35.316 --> 03:36.917
and we'll put a white bunny
on the tail.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.697
I love it.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.837
* I got a song
that ain't got no melody *

03:56.837 --> 04:00.040
It was a status symbol
just to fly private,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.576
but I wanted to take it
a step further,

04:02.576 --> 04:05.078
so I took a commercial
airliner,

04:05.078 --> 04:06.680
gutted it,

04:06.680 --> 04:10.684
and retrofitted it in a style
that was pure Playboy.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.853
* Will it go 'round
in circles? *

04:15.289 --> 04:18.392
* Will it fly high
like a bird up in the sky? *

04:18.392 --> 04:21.094
Before long my jet
became known

04:21.094 --> 04:23.764
as the Big Bunny.

04:23.764 --> 04:27.701
If Hugh Hefner can afford a
personalized airplane like this,

04:27.701 --> 04:31.271
his money must multiply
like bunnies.

04:31.271 --> 04:35.943
* I got a story that
ain't got no moral *

04:35.943 --> 04:40.213
That plane cost five and a half
million dollars...

04:40.213 --> 04:46.019
over 38 million dollars today,
and it was worth every penny.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.921
We have a series of buttons here

04:47.921 --> 04:50.924
that can control
the polarized windows.

04:50.924 --> 04:55.062
It can go all the way from light
to grey to total blackness.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.366
It can seat 38,
sleep 16.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.602
And has additional gas facility

05:01.602 --> 05:03.471
so that it can go anyplace
in the world.

05:03.471 --> 05:06.173
The Big Bunny had
a luxury bedroom,

05:06.173 --> 05:09.242
shower,

05:09.242 --> 05:11.779
a TV and movie theater,

05:11.779 --> 05:14.247
and of course a dance floor.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.884
**

05:18.486 --> 05:22.590
**

05:26.394 --> 05:29.663
Constantly surrounded
by gorgeous girls

05:29.663 --> 05:31.499
and beautiful belongings,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.801
Hefner's world may seem enviable
to some.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.037
At 44 he's unquestionably
king rabbit

05:37.037 --> 05:42.510
and certainly he takes every
opportunity to enjoy his dough.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.846
The Big Bunny,
it was an experience.

05:45.846 --> 05:49.617
It was like a house with wings.

05:49.617 --> 05:53.887
I remember the first time
our crew flew with Hef.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.758
He saw our luggage and he didn't
like the way it looked.

05:57.758 --> 06:01.194
So he went and bought everybody
luggage.

06:01.194 --> 06:05.098
"If you're gonna fly with me,
you're gonna have good luggage."

06:05.098 --> 06:08.469
My every need was taken care
of...

06:08.469 --> 06:10.337
by our jet bunnies.

06:10.337 --> 06:15.208
Jet bunnies did not wear
the traditional bunny outfit.

06:15.208 --> 06:19.513
They wore black mini dresses,
scarves and boots,

06:19.513 --> 06:22.382
very much modeled after
the Bond girls

06:22.382 --> 06:25.085
that were so popular
at the time.

06:27.120 --> 06:30.524
The Big Bunny became
a media sensation.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.226
It is the only way to fly.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.428
Really?!

06:34.428 --> 06:38.031
Who cares?

06:38.031 --> 06:41.168
These are all people who work
at the A&P.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.707
But I had no idea that the next
time I flew to L.A.

06:46.707 --> 06:50.410
my life would change forever.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.948
It's in five minutes.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.717
Thanks for coming
to the set.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.085
What do you think?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.219
I like it.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.722
I'm not so sure about
the furniture in front.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.591
We've got an orange sofa
down in the back there,

07:03.591 --> 07:04.825
I know you love that color.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.860
Okay, great.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.062
And I think we should use
the red carpet in the back.

07:09.062 --> 07:12.299
Every week on
Playboy After Dark,

07:12.299 --> 07:13.934
we packed the soundstage

07:13.934 --> 07:16.403
with great-looking models
and extras.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.540
Well, if you're happy, let me
take you through to make-up.

07:19.540 --> 07:26.113
One day, one of them captured
my full attention.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.148
I bought the plane.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.518
I'd already committed to doing
Playboy After Dark.

07:30.518 --> 07:34.922
I was preparing to live a new
adventure and a new experience

07:34.922 --> 07:38.058
in a new time frame,
or a new chapter in my life.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.628
And there she was.

07:40.628 --> 07:44.064
That wholesome beauty
was Barbara Klein,

07:44.064 --> 07:48.235
who would soon come to be known
as Barbi Benton.

07:48.235 --> 07:52.506
I met Hef on the set of Playboy
After Dark,

07:52.506 --> 07:56.043
and he asked me if I would, uh,

07:56.043 --> 07:58.612
like to go out with him
that night.

07:58.612 --> 08:01.549
How about we go out for
a drink after this?

08:01.549 --> 08:03.283
You and me?

08:03.283 --> 08:07.120
And I said, "I don't know.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.457
I've never been out with anybody
over 24."

08:10.457 --> 08:14.828
And he said, "Neither have I."

08:14.828 --> 08:18.932
* Ba da ba ba ba ba *

08:18.932 --> 08:21.569
* Ba ba ba ba ba *

08:21.569 --> 08:24.905
* Baa, la la ba ba ba *

08:24.905 --> 08:28.475
* I remember Sunday morning *

08:28.475 --> 08:32.613
Barbi had been attending UCLA
to become a veterinarian,

08:32.613 --> 08:34.047
but when she realized

08:34.047 --> 08:36.083
she couldn't stand the sight
of blood,

08:36.083 --> 08:40.053
she quickly gave up the career.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.856
She began modeling part-time,

08:42.856 --> 08:45.258
acted in a few small
commercials

08:45.258 --> 08:48.896
and then took a job as an extra
on Playboy After Dark.

08:48.896 --> 08:52.299
I'd been with my fair share
of women,

08:52.299 --> 08:54.968
but from the moment
I met Barbi,

08:54.968 --> 08:58.205
I knew she was different.

08:58.205 --> 09:02.776
* I remember Sunday morning *

09:02.776 --> 09:05.879
* I would meet him
at the park *

09:05.879 --> 09:11.018
Hef is the most romantic person
that I've ever been with.

09:11.018 --> 09:16.223
And he put me on a pedestal
and worshipped me.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.094
I hadn't been around anybody

09:21.094 --> 09:28.268
who was that affectionate
and wanted me so badly.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.770
I mean just to be with me.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.773
To sit next to me
and hold my hand.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.109
He was just so excited.
He was like a little boy.

09:36.109 --> 09:40.681
* Sunday will never
be the same *

09:40.681 --> 09:43.884
* I lost my baby's heart *

09:43.884 --> 09:50.157
* I must be back again *

09:50.157 --> 09:55.462
Hef saw her as the ultimate
girl next door,

09:55.462 --> 10:02.502
and he found her refreshing,
coed-like and a lot of fun.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.839
And Hefner really fell for her.

10:05.839 --> 10:10.343
From that point on,
all my time in Los Angeles

10:10.343 --> 10:11.979
was spent with Barbi...

10:11.979 --> 10:15.683
both off-camera and on.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.317
What kind of color would you be,
Barbi?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.519
Oh, I'd be sexy, I'd be...

10:19.519 --> 10:21.855
I'd have to be red,

10:21.855 --> 10:24.257
because it's sexy
and a little bit mysterious.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.660
Oh, wait a minute.
Burnt orange.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.895
Because that's
your favorite color.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.162
That's my favorite color!

10:32.499 --> 10:35.302
She essentially became
my co-host.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.270
I notice that Sonny and Cher

10:37.270 --> 10:39.740
are about ready to do
a number for us.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.909
And maybe Barbi would like
to do the introduction.

10:41.909 --> 10:46.113
And to everyone who watched
the show,

10:46.113 --> 10:49.917
our chemistry was impossible
to miss.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.985
Hef's girlfriend, Barbi Benton.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.855
I mean, God, Barbi Benton,
I was so in love with her.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.791
She was just a regular girl.
But she had beauty.

10:57.791 --> 11:01.028
Simon says, girls,
arms around the boys.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.297
Simon says, bring your noses
two inches apart.

11:04.297 --> 11:07.768
Simon says, bring you noses
an inch apart.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.770
Simon says, closer.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.471
Simon says, closer.

11:11.471 --> 11:15.843
Simon says, be creative.

11:15.843 --> 11:19.312
Simon says, stop, Hef.

11:19.312 --> 11:23.283
Hef, Simon and Barbara,
please say stop or you'll be...

11:23.283 --> 11:24.952
Simon says, stop!

11:24.952 --> 11:28.088
I'm out of the game.

11:32.625 --> 11:37.264
**

11:37.264 --> 11:39.733
With Barbi by my side,

11:39.733 --> 11:42.369
I became a new man.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.406
I think we should
go somewhere.

11:46.406 --> 11:47.507
Where?

11:47.507 --> 11:51.244
Yes!
What about Europe?

11:51.244 --> 11:52.479
Europe?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.947
Yeah!

11:53.947 --> 11:56.583
I did things with Barbi
that I had never done before

11:56.583 --> 11:58.018
and I've never done since.

11:58.018 --> 12:02.089
And I spent a great deal
of my time where she was.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.557
It was almost as if I was
planning for that relationship

12:04.557 --> 12:06.093
before I met her.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.727
It was a wonderful time
in my life.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.763
Africa!

12:09.763 --> 12:12.132
Where would you like to go
in Africa?

12:12.132 --> 12:13.767
Oh, gosh.

12:13.767 --> 12:16.503
I think I managed to bring him
out of his shell.

12:16.503 --> 12:20.173
He was a hermit.
He never got out of his house.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.911
* When I loved you so *

12:23.911 --> 12:26.079
I got him to do things.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.250
I'm still amazed at the things
we did.

12:30.250 --> 12:36.389
One of the things that I loved
to do with Hef was travel.

12:36.389 --> 12:42.295
We went to 16 different
countries on one trip.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.067
It was romantic.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.470
Everything we did was fun
and exciting.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.241
**

13:03.616 --> 13:08.255
* It's an ill wind *

13:08.255 --> 13:13.326
Hef and I had a lot of romance
in our lives.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.964
Everywhere we went,
it was an adventure.

13:16.964 --> 13:21.902
* ...love like I know
it should *

13:21.902 --> 13:26.673
* And I say it's a good thing *

13:26.673 --> 13:29.409
* To love someone *

13:29.409 --> 13:32.312
Barbi was the most intensely
romantic relationship

13:32.312 --> 13:34.247
that I think I had ever
been in.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.817
I said publicly that it was
I thought the first time

13:37.817 --> 13:39.652
I'd really been in love.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.056
I was having the ultimate
high school courtship

13:43.056 --> 13:44.257
in my early 40s.

13:44.257 --> 13:50.097
* Ooh, ooh, yeah *

13:51.999 --> 13:55.035
I have some news that
I think a lot of you

13:55.035 --> 13:56.236
will be happy to hear.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.939
Starting with the next issue,

13:58.939 --> 14:02.042
it's time for me
to take a step back.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.144
Now, I'm still going
to be approving

14:04.144 --> 14:06.146
every page of the magazine,

14:06.146 --> 14:10.650
but this means no more
60-page memos, spec.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.253
With the magazine doing so well

14:13.253 --> 14:15.855
and Barbi taking up
more of my time,

14:15.855 --> 14:17.457
I finally decided it was time

14:17.457 --> 14:19.859
to do something
I'd always resisted...

14:19.859 --> 14:21.361
delegate.

14:21.361 --> 14:24.497
I gave Tajiri, Spectorsky
and Kretchmer

14:24.497 --> 14:26.633
more creative control
over the magazine,

14:26.633 --> 14:30.570
and made Arnie Executive VP
of Playboy Enterprises.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.740
But I saved one of
the most important assignments

14:33.740 --> 14:36.409
for Victor Lownes.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.878
**

14:38.878 --> 14:40.780
Over the last several years,

14:40.780 --> 14:44.751
we'd successfully opened 15
Playboy Clubs within the U.S.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.487
and 3 international locations.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.525
But if we were going to become
a worldwide phenomenon,

14:52.525 --> 14:55.028
there was only one place left
to go.

14:55.028 --> 14:58.765
* You ought to hear the monkey
when he sings the blues *

14:58.765 --> 15:02.735
* Monkey, oh yeah,
monkey, oh yeah *

15:02.735 --> 15:06.439
London was home
to the swinging '60s,

15:06.439 --> 15:09.476
an economic boom had brought
average earnings

15:09.476 --> 15:12.212
almost twice as high
as the cost of living.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.883
And on top of that,

15:16.883 --> 15:20.587
it had the youngest population
of any city in the world.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.191
With 40% of residents
under 25 years old,

15:24.191 --> 15:26.159
they were all looking
to go out,

15:26.159 --> 15:29.362
spend their money and have fun.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.269
I knew Victor was the only man

15:36.269 --> 15:39.006
who could develop
the London Playboy Club,

15:39.006 --> 15:41.308
so I sent him over
to England

15:41.308 --> 15:44.744
and he wasted no time
setting things in motion.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.447
London was really quite
a hot place.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.416
And it seemed like a good move

15:49.416 --> 15:53.820
and they decided to send me
over to organize it,

15:53.820 --> 15:55.388
which I did.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.357
He'd never been to Britain,

15:57.357 --> 16:00.293
but he threw himself
into London life.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.495
When he was researching
everything,

16:02.495 --> 16:08.068
he was taken to clubs
where there were gaming tables.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.703
Thanks to a recent ruling
in London,

16:10.703 --> 16:15.942
Vic had license to take the
club in a whole new direction.

16:15.942 --> 16:19.346
Gambling had just become
legalized.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.415
I immediately thought
we ought to get into gambling

16:22.415 --> 16:24.317
because it seemed like
a very profitable avenue.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.054
He called Hefner and said,

16:27.054 --> 16:29.622
"Listen, Hef, they are gambling
here in Britain.

16:29.622 --> 16:30.857
It's legal."

16:30.857 --> 16:33.160
Because in America,
it was only in Vegas.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.995
So Victor had
this brilliant idea

16:35.995 --> 16:39.466
of opening Playboy as a casino.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.735
**

16:48.141 --> 16:49.976
After months of work

16:49.976 --> 16:54.414
and a $2 million investment,
we held our grand opening.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.784
1,500 guests attended
the black tie affair,

16:57.784 --> 17:02.389
which was the most star-studded
in our history.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.957
Sidney Poitier...

17:04.957 --> 17:07.227
James Garner...

17:07.227 --> 17:10.597
and even London royalty
were there.

17:10.597 --> 17:14.234
The opening night guest list
is fascinating to me

17:14.234 --> 17:17.370
because it's such a great
mélange of people.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.473
'Cause he had
the Duke of Bedford,

17:20.473 --> 17:25.178
Rudolph Nureyev was there,
the world famous ballet dancer.

17:25.178 --> 17:28.381
And then of course
Roman Polanski.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.750
Roman and Victor were very,
very close friends.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.622
But no Playboy Club
would be complete

17:35.622 --> 17:37.924
without top-notch
entertainment.

17:37.924 --> 17:41.561
Luckily, Vic knew all the best
performers,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.730
and we were able to treat
our guests

17:43.730 --> 17:47.500
to a performance from one
of the fastest-rising
comedians in America.

17:47.500 --> 17:51.738
It was very sad and I didn't
know what the button was for.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.541
And they told me
that if you lose a button,

17:54.541 --> 17:56.243
you take a button off the inside

17:56.243 --> 17:58.378
and you sew it onto the outside,
you got a button.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.314
And, uh, I had the jacket
for two weeks

18:01.314 --> 18:02.782
and, just my luck,

18:02.782 --> 18:06.886
I lost from the outside
of my jacket, a button hole.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.327
When we opened the club here,

18:14.327 --> 18:19.031
we were bringing over acts
from America to perform.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.867
Woody Allen opened the club.

18:20.867 --> 18:24.837
He's a personal friend
and he lived right next door.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.739
**

18:26.739 --> 18:31.211
Vic was in his element,
and just as I expected,

18:31.211 --> 18:33.580
he created the perfect venue

18:33.580 --> 18:35.982
to introduce Playboy
to London society.

18:35.982 --> 18:39.686
* I had a girl,
she was my queen *

18:42.589 --> 18:45.458
* She didn't love me
like I loved her *

18:45.458 --> 18:47.494
It was an incredible party

18:47.494 --> 18:49.962
and the club stayed open
24 hours a day,

18:49.962 --> 18:53.500
so the celebration continued
well after dawn.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.336
What I saw in London that summer

18:56.336 --> 19:00.807
was a whole revolution
in social sexual values.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.909
The entire lifestyle
from England

19:02.909 --> 19:06.279
was about to explode
across the world.

19:06.279 --> 19:09.549
And I came back from that trip

19:09.549 --> 19:11.684
feeling that I'd seen
the future.

19:11.684 --> 19:15.922
* Somebody tell me
what I've done wrong *

19:18.090 --> 19:20.727
**

19:23.496 --> 19:25.298
In less than a year,

19:25.298 --> 19:28.968
the London Playboy Club under
Victor was making more money

19:28.968 --> 19:32.372
than any casino in Europe
or Las Vegas.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.708
The London casino was the most

19:35.708 --> 19:39.412
successful casino in the world
for a number of years.

19:41.948 --> 19:45.885
It was a huge celebrity hangout.

19:45.885 --> 19:51.291
When Hollywood came to London,
first stop was the Playboy Club.

19:51.291 --> 19:55.528
It was a once in
a lifetime club experience.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.668
The ladies they had selected
in Britain

20:01.668 --> 20:05.305
to be the British bunnies
were spectacular.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.940
They were not only gorgeous,
they were witty,

20:07.940 --> 20:11.544
they were funny, they had
various regional accents

20:11.544 --> 20:14.447
that were pleasant and fun
to hear.

20:14.447 --> 20:17.484
And they were just great.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.458
Of course being the head

20:25.458 --> 20:28.027
of the most successful club
in the world

20:28.027 --> 20:29.829
had other perks.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.832
I first met Victor when I became
a bunny girl.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.635
And so we were
at the Playboy Club

20:35.635 --> 20:39.005
and a man appeared on the floor.

20:39.005 --> 20:42.809
We didn't know who it was,
but we knew he was somebody

20:42.809 --> 20:46.979
just by his vitality
and his looks and his voice,

20:46.979 --> 20:48.648
it just sounded different.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.617
And it turned out
it was Victor Lownes.

20:50.617 --> 20:53.586
The boss, so to speak.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.790
Victor was constantly
surrounded by beautiful women,

20:57.790 --> 21:01.694
but soon enough, one particular
bunny stood out among the rest.

21:14.307 --> 21:19.145
* I don't know why *

21:19.145 --> 21:20.980
And you are?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.382
Marilyn Cole.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.983
It's my first day here.

21:23.983 --> 21:24.917
Mmm, I picked up on that.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.455
But don't worry,
you'll do just fine.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.089
You're a real beauty.

21:30.089 --> 21:31.691
Some people say I'm too tall.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.693
Well, those people don't know
what they're talking about.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.763
Me, on the other hand,
I'm an expert.

21:36.763 --> 21:39.432
And trust me, you're perfect.

21:39.432 --> 21:41.501
Absolutely perfect.

21:41.501 --> 21:44.371
Thank you, Mr. Lownes.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.840
Please call me Victor.

21:50.977 --> 21:55.982
I dated Marilyn because
she was drop-dead gorgeous

21:55.982 --> 21:57.384
when I saw her,

21:57.384 --> 22:01.654
and she was
intelligent and interesting.

22:12.699 --> 22:16.135
While Victor was
falling in love in London,

22:16.135 --> 22:21.007
my relationship with Barbi
was becoming more serious.

22:21.007 --> 22:24.577
And we were practically
inseparable.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.913
What are you doing up?

22:26.913 --> 22:29.782
I thought you might like
some breakfast.

22:29.782 --> 22:34.421
Oh, sweetheart, come here.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.427
Oh, and a flower!

22:40.427 --> 22:41.794
Yes, I picked that myself.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.896
- No, you didn't.
- I did.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.599
I don't believe you
for a second,
but you're still sweet.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.038
Mmm, that's great.

22:53.806 --> 22:55.675
What's that?

23:01.247 --> 23:03.683
I don't know.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.792
**

23:12.792 --> 23:14.494
Since Playboy's inception,

23:14.494 --> 23:17.730
the magazine had never faced
any real competition.

23:17.730 --> 23:20.767
But that all changed in 1969

23:20.767 --> 23:23.169
when a publication called
Penthouse

23:23.169 --> 23:24.937
burst onto the scene

23:24.937 --> 23:27.907
and made it its mission
to take Playboy down

23:27.907 --> 23:31.143
* Things look bad
from over here *

23:31.143 --> 23:35.214
When Penthouse came onto
the scene in the late 1960s,

23:35.214 --> 23:38.451
it really presented a challenge
to Playboy.

23:38.451 --> 23:41.988
It sought to be
a lifestyle magazine.

23:41.988 --> 23:45.157
It talked about things
like fashion and politics.

23:45.157 --> 23:49.629
And so Penthouse was taking
the formula

23:49.629 --> 23:51.664
that Playboy had established.

23:51.664 --> 23:55.001
The man who runs it is
44-year-old Robert Guccione,

23:55.001 --> 23:58.037
Brooklyn born but a longtime
European resident.

23:58.037 --> 24:01.741
Penthouse jumped the Atlantic
from England in 1969

24:01.741 --> 24:04.877
with a promotion aimed directly
at Playboy.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.378
The Penthouse Pet of the Year

24:06.378 --> 24:10.016
is Guccione's version of
Hefner's Playmate of the Year.

24:10.016 --> 24:13.385
Guccione has dreams of an empire
to surpass Hefner's.

24:13.385 --> 24:15.187
And he's working at getting it.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.490
* Get out of the way *

24:17.490 --> 24:19.826
* I ain't got much time *

24:19.826 --> 24:22.361
But there was one thing
Penthouse offered

24:22.361 --> 24:24.531
that Playboy never had.

24:24.531 --> 24:27.967
Penthouse was showing
pubic hair.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.039
That had always been
the line of demarcation

24:33.039 --> 24:38.177
that Hef and most men's
magazines would not cross

24:38.177 --> 24:40.513
in order to avoid the risk

24:40.513 --> 24:42.849
of obscenity charges
by the government.

24:42.849 --> 24:47.486
But then here came Penthouse.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.426
Only six months earlier,

24:54.426 --> 24:58.330
the U.S. Supreme Court made
a major ruling on obscenity,

24:58.330 --> 25:01.467
stating that people could view
whatever they wished

25:01.467 --> 25:03.335
in the privacy of their homes,

25:03.335 --> 25:06.939
effectively loosening obscenity
standards in America.

25:09.408 --> 25:13.245
By the early '70s,
you had porn chic magazines

25:13.245 --> 25:17.550
that were, uh, a lot more
explicit than Playboy ever was.

25:19.085 --> 25:21.020
And, of course, you had
hardcore pornography films

25:21.020 --> 25:23.756
running in the neighborhood
theaters.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.391
We've come a long ways, baby.

25:25.391 --> 25:28.260
The new laws gave readers
access

25:28.260 --> 25:32.732
to a whole new world
of explicit photos.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.968
And Penthouse
took full advantage.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.911
The government came after me
with guns blazing for Mansfield,

25:44.911 --> 25:47.513
but Penthouse shows bush,
and what? Nothing.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.881
Times have changed, Hef.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.482
I wouldn't exactly call it
"showing bush."

25:50.482 --> 25:51.684
It's just a glimpse
of her pubic hair.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.452
You know what I mean, Kretch.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.922
You can't find a copy anywhere.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.558
Is that true?

25:59.558 --> 26:00.860
It's completely sold out.

26:00.860 --> 26:03.930
The entire print run was gone
within the week.

26:03.930 --> 26:08.367
Hef, a reporter from Time
just called.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.902
And?

26:09.902 --> 26:11.470
They wanted to get
your reaction.

26:11.470 --> 26:13.072
To what?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.040
To this.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.980
You know, it's
completely natural

26:20.980 --> 26:26.819
for the established brand
to be threatened by outsiders

26:26.819 --> 26:29.521
that are willing to be
much more extreme.

26:29.521 --> 26:32.925
Just like Esquire
was threatened by Playboy,

26:32.925 --> 26:35.594
I'm sure Playboy had to look
at Penthouse

26:35.594 --> 26:39.531
and decide whether or not it was
gonna go as far as Penthouse,

26:39.531 --> 26:43.369
or whether it was good enough
to sort of stay the course.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.873
Even with the recent court
rulings,

26:46.873 --> 26:48.975
I still believed
that our playmates

26:48.975 --> 26:52.344
didn't need to show everything
to be sexy.

26:52.344 --> 26:57.516
But Penthouse, riding the wave
of relaxed standards,

26:57.516 --> 27:01.921
quickly began gaining ground
on Playboy.

27:01.921 --> 27:05.992
They doubled their circulation
from 235,000

27:05.992 --> 27:10.262
to over half a million
in just one year.

27:10.262 --> 27:12.965
**

27:16.769 --> 27:20.406
* Yellow diamond in the sky *

27:20.406 --> 27:23.042
This was really difficult
for Hefner

27:23.042 --> 27:26.145
because he had spent
his life...

27:26.145 --> 27:31.918
his crusade was mainstreaming
middle class sexuality,

27:31.918 --> 27:36.555
and so to remove Playboy
from that status

27:36.555 --> 27:41.193
would have challenged everything
he had worked so hard for.

27:41.193 --> 27:44.330
* Sometimes it seems so heavy *

27:44.330 --> 27:48.267
Penthouse had become too big
to ignore.

27:48.267 --> 27:53.239
Playboy had started
a sexual revolution,

27:53.239 --> 27:56.709
but now we were being
left behind.

27:56.709 --> 28:00.046
Although it is hard
to conceive now,

28:00.046 --> 28:03.015
the idea of the playmate
showing pubic hair

28:03.015 --> 28:07.219
was a hard hurdle to overcome.

28:07.219 --> 28:11.858
But the world recognized that
Penthouse was pushing Playboy,

28:11.858 --> 28:14.761
so he went there.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.929
* Yeah yeah yeah *

28:21.233 --> 28:25.437
**

28:25.437 --> 28:28.507
Nine months after Penthouse
changed the game,

28:28.507 --> 28:32.078
a new, more revealing Playboy
hit the shelves.

28:32.078 --> 28:35.647
In the first issue of 1971,

28:35.647 --> 28:38.985
Miss January, Liv Lindeland,

28:38.985 --> 28:44.090
showed more than any playmate
had before.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.826
And our readers approved...

28:46.826 --> 28:51.497
pushing circulation to over
six million issues per month.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.269
**

28:58.905 --> 29:00.639
But competition from Penthouse

29:00.639 --> 29:03.843
wasn't the only opposition
I faced that year.

29:03.843 --> 29:07.246
The battle cry of the women's
liberation movement

29:07.246 --> 29:09.648
rings out down New York's
Fifth Avenue

29:09.648 --> 29:12.118
as more than 10,000
militant feminists

29:12.118 --> 29:15.021
stage a one-day strike
for equal rights.

29:15.021 --> 29:19.591
* Just flew in, yeah *

29:19.591 --> 29:22.661
When the women's movement
really comes onto the scene

29:22.661 --> 29:25.297
in the late '60's
and early 1970s,

29:25.297 --> 29:27.499
Playboy was a primary target.

29:27.499 --> 29:31.503
Because feminists argued
that the centerfold images

29:31.503 --> 29:34.974
were degrading to women
and objectifying.

29:34.974 --> 29:39.846
And so, they really criticized
Hugh Hefner

29:39.846 --> 29:44.750
as a purveyor of patriarchy
and sexism

29:44.750 --> 29:46.185
and the degradation of women.

29:46.185 --> 29:48.520
* Your heart's gonna melt ya *

29:48.520 --> 29:50.923
Now, there had always been
groups of women

29:50.923 --> 29:52.791
who disliked Playboy.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.361
But back in the early days
of the magazine,

29:55.361 --> 29:58.797
they were mostly conservative,
religious types.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.599
I knew this was different.

30:00.599 --> 30:02.201
Join us now!

30:02.201 --> 30:05.504
Sisterhood is powerful,
join us now!

30:07.806 --> 30:12.311
The 1960s had given rise
to a second wave of feminism.

30:12.311 --> 30:16.248
While their predecessors
had fought for things

30:16.248 --> 30:20.452
like the right to vote,

30:20.452 --> 30:23.923
these women were fighting
for access to birth control,

30:23.923 --> 30:27.493
abortion and equal rights.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.062
It's equal rights to have a job,
to have respect,

30:30.062 --> 30:31.597
to not be viewed
as a piece of meat.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.665
We just want what men have had
all these years

30:33.665 --> 30:38.337
* Who knows
where the time goes *

30:38.337 --> 30:41.307
Led by women including
Betty Friedan...

30:41.307 --> 30:45.044
This will continue
as a political coalition

30:45.044 --> 30:46.812
to achieve the unfinished
revolution,

30:46.812 --> 30:49.481
to win the unfinished revolution
of women's equality.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.350
...Bella Abzug...

30:51.350 --> 30:55.187
We proclaim that we talk
about free abortion on demand,

30:55.187 --> 30:57.924
we need to have it now!

30:57.924 --> 30:59.391
...and Gloria Steinem.

30:59.391 --> 31:02.294
Now, thanks to the spirit
of equality in the air

31:02.294 --> 31:05.631
and to the work of many
of my more foresighted sisters,

31:05.631 --> 31:08.300
I no longer accept
society's judgment

31:08.300 --> 31:10.970
that my group is second class.

31:10.970 --> 31:15.074
Steinem had been a harsh critic
of Playboy for many years.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.613
In 1963, she even went
undercover as a bunny

31:21.613 --> 31:23.349
in our New York club...

31:23.349 --> 31:25.651
giving herself a fake name...

31:25.651 --> 31:29.055
and ultimately writing
an article about her experience

31:29.055 --> 31:31.357
for Show magazine.

31:34.460 --> 31:37.863
I exposed the working conditions
at the Playboy Club,

31:37.863 --> 31:39.831
which were so horrendous.

31:39.831 --> 31:43.502
If you can only get a job,
you know, in three-inch heels,

31:43.502 --> 31:46.705
falling out of your costume
serving food,

31:46.705 --> 31:48.240
you know, it's not...

31:48.240 --> 31:50.176
I mean, men don't have
to fall out of their costumes

31:50.176 --> 31:51.877
to serve food.

31:51.877 --> 31:55.447
Her article came out
in May of 1963.

31:55.447 --> 32:00.352
Needless to say, I didn't agree
with her evaluation.

32:00.352 --> 32:05.157
She characterized the experience
as extremely degrading.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.326
As extremely objectifying.

32:07.326 --> 32:10.729
That instead of being an
exciting, adventurous,

32:10.729 --> 32:14.766
well-paying job for young women
in cities like New York,

32:14.766 --> 32:20.206
she said that this was actually
intense labor, exploitation,

32:20.206 --> 32:22.874
and a really sexist place

32:22.874 --> 32:26.945
that was just using women
further for the benefit of men.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.858
I hadn't paid much attention
to the article at the time,

32:39.858 --> 32:43.129
but now the feminist movement
had made Playboy

32:43.129 --> 32:47.533
one of its main targets,
and I knew I had to respond.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.271
I truly believed Playboy
and the feminists

32:52.271 --> 32:54.440
were on the same side,

32:54.440 --> 32:56.875
and I felt the best way
to explain myself

32:56.875 --> 32:59.678
was to speak with Steinem
face to face.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.748
So what men do you admire?
And why?

33:02.748 --> 33:06.118
Well, I've always admired
Jack and Robert Kennedy.

33:06.118 --> 33:09.155
How about women?
What women do you admire?

33:09.155 --> 33:10.922
Margaret Mead, very much.

33:10.922 --> 33:15.527
Uh, uh, uh...

33:15.527 --> 33:18.864
I can't remember her name
off the top of my head,

33:18.864 --> 33:21.067
but the head of SIECUS.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.035
Mary Calderone.

33:23.035 --> 33:26.605
Mary Calderone, yes.
Very much so.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.408
The interview got off
to a rough start

33:29.408 --> 33:32.044
and it only went downhill
from there.

33:32.044 --> 33:36.315
What I don't understand is why
feminists don't appreciate us,

33:36.315 --> 33:39.051
appreciate the Playboy
philosophy.

33:39.051 --> 33:42.321
I never picked them out
as special enemies.

33:42.321 --> 33:44.656
They chose me first.

33:44.656 --> 33:48.160
But don't you understand that
you have made women objects?

33:48.160 --> 33:51.263
It's as if we're put
on a meat hook.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.766
And, according
to Playboy philosophy,

33:54.766 --> 33:56.768
women are useless with age.

33:56.768 --> 34:00.372
Now, wait a second, now, I'm all
for women's right to vote,

34:00.372 --> 34:02.874
to own property, all of that.

34:02.874 --> 34:08.914
What I'm saying is that I think
women can be attractive to men.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.850
And I think men should
be attractive to women,

34:11.850 --> 34:15.053
but I wouldn't rest their
entire identity on it.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.194
Let's take a different tact.

34:22.194 --> 34:26.198
If you had one thing to say to
the women readers of McCall's,

34:26.198 --> 34:27.699
what would it be?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.501
Buy Playboy.

34:29.501 --> 34:32.003
That's your whole message?

34:32.003 --> 34:33.705
That's it.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.375
All right, thank you very much,
Gloria.

34:36.375 --> 34:39.345
Now, if you'll excuse me.

34:45.050 --> 34:47.753
Steinem had recorded
our discussion

34:47.753 --> 34:51.757
for the October issue
of McCall's magazine.

34:51.757 --> 34:54.826
And when the issue
hit newsstands,

34:54.826 --> 34:57.263
it was clear
that I hadn't made my point

34:57.263 --> 34:59.097
as effectively as I thought.

34:59.097 --> 35:02.934
The women's movement
attacking the magazine

35:02.934 --> 35:04.770
certainly caught him up short.

35:04.770 --> 35:08.073
He thought he was doing
a great job for women.

35:08.073 --> 35:10.609
Saying that good girls like sex,

35:10.609 --> 35:14.012
saying that women should have
charge of their own sex lives.

35:14.012 --> 35:20.286
Being in favor of abortion,
placing women in jobs.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.623
My dad was carving out a road

35:24.623 --> 35:27.959
for men and women
to say we like sex.

35:27.959 --> 35:31.129
And he was doing it
from the male point of view.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.998
Gloria Steinem was saying,

35:32.998 --> 35:35.801
there really aren't a whole lot
of opportunities out there

35:35.801 --> 35:37.903
that allow women
to pursue a career

35:37.903 --> 35:41.340
that doesn't involve
objectifying one's self.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.510
And that point was fair to make.
Because it's true.

35:44.510 --> 35:49.281
While I had tried to smooth
over Playboy's relationship

35:49.281 --> 35:51.116
with the movement,

35:51.116 --> 35:55.254
it seemed I had just made
the situation worse.

35:55.254 --> 36:00.091
But I was determined to prove
that Playboy was not sexist,

36:00.091 --> 36:03.395
so I decided to try again.

36:03.395 --> 36:08.867
And this time, I wanted
to do it in prime time.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.902
**

36:10.902 --> 36:13.639
The Dick Cavett Show!

36:13.639 --> 36:17.276
With Hugh Hefner,
Jefferson Airplane...

36:17.276 --> 36:19.010
At that time,

36:19.010 --> 36:22.214
The Dick Cavett Show had been
on the air for about two years.

36:22.214 --> 36:24.082
They had a huge audience

36:24.082 --> 36:26.285
and Cavett regularly
brought on guests

36:26.285 --> 36:27.619
who had something to say.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.021
My next guest has created
an empire.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.624
In fact, The London Times said
they always refer to Hefner

36:32.624 --> 36:33.992
as on of the great
empire builders

36:33.992 --> 36:36.061
and they said that he is
as well known a symbol

36:36.061 --> 36:37.763
of American life as Coca-Cola.

36:37.763 --> 36:40.499
Will you welcome
Mr. Hugh Hefner.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.472
So when he asked me
to come on his show

36:46.472 --> 36:51.343
with two prominent feminists,
I didn't hesitate for a second.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.051
It looks like a show

37:00.051 --> 37:03.622
that was probably contrived
for controversy.

37:03.622 --> 37:07.326
Will you welcome Susan
Brownmiller and Sally Kempton.

37:07.326 --> 37:10.729
And the show went on from there.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.498
They oppress us as women.

37:12.498 --> 37:16.602
They benefit from oppressing
women, they really do.

37:16.602 --> 37:20.272
Hefner has built an empire
based on oppressing women.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.012
Have you had this reaction
before tonight?

37:27.012 --> 37:29.415
- Yes. Can I respond
just a little bit?
- All right.

37:29.415 --> 37:33.452
I think that women,
over generations and centuries,

37:33.452 --> 37:34.820
have indeed been oppressed.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.422
I think there's no question
about it.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.357
I think there are still many
areas in society

37:38.357 --> 37:40.492
in which they do not have
equal job opportunity.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.361
But I take issue and separate

37:42.361 --> 37:44.730
in this one rather
fundamental area.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.599
I think whether you are
a male or female

37:47.599 --> 37:50.602
is the beginning of who you are
as a human being.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.971
I think that it's important

37:52.971 --> 37:55.574
and I think that it is important
emotionally

37:55.574 --> 37:56.708
as well as physically.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.109
I think there are differences

37:58.109 --> 37:59.611
and I think there should
continue to be differences.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.246
Would you like to respond,
Susan?

38:01.246 --> 38:02.848
I certainly would.

38:02.848 --> 38:04.850
The role that you have selected
for women is degrading to women

38:04.850 --> 38:07.085
because you choose to see
women as sex objects,

38:07.085 --> 38:09.220
not as full human beings.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.256
Well, it obviously isn't
degrading...

38:11.256 --> 38:12.624
Hold on now.
The day that...

38:12.624 --> 38:14.393
It obviously isn't degrading
to a lot of women.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.161
I want to say...
I haven't finished.

38:16.161 --> 38:18.430
The day that you are willing to
come out here with a cottontail

38:18.430 --> 38:20.332
attached to your rear end...

38:26.071 --> 38:28.239
You make them look
like animals, yes.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.608
Women aren't bunnies.

38:29.608 --> 38:31.276
They're not rabbits,
they're human beings.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.981
We have to pause.
We'll be back in a moment.

38:37.949 --> 38:41.252
I don't know if Hefner expected
quite as much assault

38:41.252 --> 38:43.889
as he was in for
when he came on.

38:43.889 --> 38:45.791
But it made
for lively television.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.192
I loved it.

38:47.192 --> 38:52.864
* If I could show you, Robin,
girl, you'd know... *

38:52.864 --> 38:54.766
I was starting to realize

38:54.766 --> 38:57.135
this was a conflict
I wasn't going to win.

38:57.135 --> 38:58.670
Hugh Hefner is my enemy.

39:02.007 --> 39:06.378
I do think Hef was surprised
at the harsh critique

39:06.378 --> 39:08.580
in the feminist movement
of Playboy.

39:08.580 --> 39:11.082
He felt, quite justifiably,

39:11.082 --> 39:14.019
that he'd been an ally in a lot
of political battles.

39:15.854 --> 39:20.025
But I think he didn't understand
that there was an element

39:20.025 --> 39:24.763
of the feminist movement
grappling with sexual imagery,

39:24.763 --> 39:27.799
and that part
of the women's movement

39:27.799 --> 39:30.702
was not gonna be happy
with Playboy.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.405
* If I could show you, Robin *

39:33.405 --> 39:36.642
As frustrated as I was
with these attacks,

39:36.642 --> 39:39.411
I'd soon have to turn
my attention

39:39.411 --> 39:41.980
to a battle I could fight...

39:41.980 --> 39:47.052
as Penthouse was about
to push the envelope again.

39:47.052 --> 39:51.523
Forcing us to question how far
Playboy was willing to go.

39:51.523 --> 39:55.527
* I was weak, I thought
that it would always last *

39:57.629 --> 40:01.533
* Every little movement *

40:01.533 --> 40:05.437
* Every motion of your hips *

40:05.437 --> 40:08.874
* I feel the compulsion *

40:08.874 --> 40:14.079
* To pull you
to my sweet lips *

40:14.079 --> 40:18.450
* Is it a black magic spell *

40:18.450 --> 40:21.520
* You put me under? *

40:21.520 --> 40:24.790
* This miracle moment *

40:24.790 --> 40:29.394
* Never let it end *

40:29.394 --> 40:33.565
* Every little movement *

40:33.565 --> 40:37.335
* Is beyond improvement *

40:37.335 --> 40:40.205
* You are the magician *

40:40.205 --> 40:45.410
* I've been wishing for
forever *

40:45.410 --> 40:49.515
* Every little movement *

40:49.515 --> 40:52.984
* Every little movement **
