WEBVTT

00:13.045 --> 00:16.325
- She is my sister, Lorna.
- Well, half-sister.

00:16.405 --> 00:18.525
Ken, she's bossing me around
in my home.

00:18.605 --> 00:22.045
She's even taken to creeping in
uninvited, like Nosferatu.

00:22.125 --> 00:24.645
Well, that doesn't even work
'cos vampires have to be invited in.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.285
Thank you. Good point, Rachel.

00:26.365 --> 00:28.245
Still, I don't want her here.

00:28.325 --> 00:29.765
-She's a bad influence.

00:30.645 --> 00:33.405
- Aw, Dylan!
-Well, I think she's pretty cool.

00:33.485 --> 00:35.765
Dylan, she tried to turn you
into a weed dealer.

00:35.845 --> 00:39.725
Er, yes, and that is <i>the </i>most
gangsta thing I have ever done.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.765
Don't say gangsta, please,
you're from Lichfield.

00:42.605 --> 00:44.765
Rachel, you know what
I'm saying, don't you?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.885
I mean, don't you find Ivy
a bit meddly?

00:47.965 --> 00:52.125
Well, she always seems to smell
of whatever toiletries I've recently lost.

00:52.205 --> 00:53.885
See, Ken, she's dodgy.

00:53.965 --> 00:55.605
She's my flesh and blood.

00:55.685 --> 00:57.805
No, Ken, she wanted to buy
your flesh and blood.

00:57.885 --> 01:01.445
Oh, come on, that was
just a harmless... sibling...

01:02.085 --> 01:04.685
It was weird, wasn't it?
That <i>was </i>weird, actually.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.005
-Bit weird.
-It's really weird.

01:13.645 --> 01:15.205
You snogged?

01:17.285 --> 01:21.765
I just don't want you to feel,
you know, cheated on.

01:28.605 --> 01:30.045
Honestly, no.

01:30.845 --> 01:33.405
It's an unwritten rule,
lesbianism doesn't count.

01:33.485 --> 01:35.805
-Oh, Jesus, Ben!
-Let him off.

01:35.885 --> 01:38.725
-So, you get it.
-Of course.

01:38.805 --> 01:42.045
You were as high as
a Gulf Stream 600 and in the moment...

01:44.485 --> 01:45.685
So...

01:45.765 --> 01:49.005
who, er, kissed who, you know, first?

01:49.085 --> 01:50.405
Was...

01:50.485 --> 01:52.725
-Morning, young people.
-Ivy, hi!

01:53.285 --> 01:57.605
I will not get up right now,
if that's OK.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.005
Rachel,
something good happened to you.

02:00.085 --> 02:02.045
-You're glowing.
-Oh!

02:02.125 --> 02:03.365
You could pass for 29.

02:03.445 --> 02:07.405
-I'm 27.
-Oh, God. Let's learn from this.

02:07.485 --> 02:09.885
I need more tact,
you need more skincare.

02:09.965 --> 02:13.605
Anyway, I'm having a meeting in here
in a couple of minutes with your father

02:13.685 --> 02:15.405
to brief him
for his newspaper interview.
So y'all need to get outta here.

02:17.285 --> 02:19.485
-Out!
-All right.

02:21.765 --> 02:23.725
Lorna, you can't come in,
meeting's starting soon.

02:23.805 --> 02:25.205
Go on, scoot!

02:25.285 --> 02:27.005
-Scoot, scoot, scoot!
-Scoot?

02:46.845 --> 02:48.725
I look like a smart-casual walrus.

02:48.805 --> 02:50.165
Oh.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.925
-Wear this one.
-It's just so plain.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.725
And very you.
This Lucy woman is going to like you.

02:57.805 --> 03:01.085
You think? Lorna, she is the editor
of the <i>Lichfield Argus</i>.

03:01.165 --> 03:04.245
If I impress her, it could be
really big for the election.

03:04.325 --> 03:06.005
Maybe I should go
and buy a new suit.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.765
-Don't waste the money, Ken.
-I just...

03:09.405 --> 03:11.765
I just want something
with a bit of a wow factor.

03:11.845 --> 03:15.245
This isn't flashy but it's...
it's reliable.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.125
It's unthreatening.

03:17.205 --> 03:18.565
Like you.

03:19.645 --> 03:20.885
And...

03:22.325 --> 03:24.365
very sexy and very good in bed.

03:26.805 --> 03:28.165
Come on, Lorn.

03:34.405 --> 03:37.405
Just goes to show, we were getting
all worried about that kiss,

03:37.485 --> 03:40.245
-but Ben was absolutely fine.
-God, yeah.

03:40.325 --> 03:43.005
Just, by the way,
you're quite a good kisser.

03:43.085 --> 03:44.565
Oh, thank you!

03:44.645 --> 03:46.085
You're quite a good kisser, too.

03:46.165 --> 03:47.765
-Oh.

03:50.885 --> 03:52.085
Oh, wow.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.125
The architect guy
has asked me out on a date.

03:54.205 --> 03:55.485
Let me see.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.525
-Wow.
-Yeah, I know.

04:00.605 --> 04:02.525
Well...

04:02.605 --> 04:04.205
Should I go?

04:04.285 --> 04:05.765
Go?

04:05.845 --> 04:08.365
God, yeah, like...
I mean, how couldn't you go?

04:09.165 --> 04:10.285
I guess I'll go.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.565
Ooh!

04:17.645 --> 04:19.245
-How did the meeting go?
-Terrible.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.525
At the end, when I asked
if I could count on her support,

04:22.605 --> 04:24.565
she just looked out of the window
and sighed.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.605
-A wistful, happy sigh?
-No, she just thought I was "meh".

04:29.685 --> 04:31.845
I told you
I should've bought a new suit.

04:31.925 --> 04:34.765
And maybe not met her
in Wetherspoons.

04:34.845 --> 04:36.325
-You can't be serious.
-See?

04:36.405 --> 04:38.325
- Nosferatu.
-Come on!

04:38.405 --> 04:40.405
You went to a meeting in <i>that </i>suit?

04:40.485 --> 04:41.805
No wonder she didn't back you.

04:41.885 --> 04:44.405
I don't even know where you would
get something like that.

04:44.485 --> 04:47.125
Well, Lorna bought it.
She buys all my clothes.

04:47.205 --> 04:48.605
Yeah, which is not easy.

04:48.685 --> 04:50.885
There's only one website
that sells suits for his frame.

04:50.965 --> 04:53.445
What's that site called again, Dad?
Isn't it moobs.com?

04:53.525 --> 04:55.645
Yeah, and where do you go?
Twat.face?

04:55.725 --> 04:57.325
Yeah, I do, actually.

04:57.405 --> 04:58.845
But not for clothes.

04:58.925 --> 05:01.125
-Oh...
-Maybe it's for the best, Ken.

05:01.205 --> 05:05.005
If Lucy Merriweather wants to support
a flashy MP candidate,

05:05.085 --> 05:06.685
well, then, that's not you, is it?

05:06.765 --> 05:09.085
You can't change yourself
to suit the public mood.

05:09.165 --> 05:11.245
That's exactly how politics works.

05:11.325 --> 05:13.485
Oh, my God, it's you!

05:13.565 --> 05:17.525
You're the reason that Ken hasn't achieved
anything in his whole entire life.

05:17.605 --> 05:20.685
-Hey, I have achieved some things!
-What do you mean, I'm the reason?

05:20.765 --> 05:23.045
Your small-town vibe
is holding him back.

05:23.125 --> 05:26.045
Buying his clothes
and accepting his failures.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.805
This is Big Jack's son!

05:27.885 --> 05:32.205
He should be out shaking the world,
not settling for this.

05:32.285 --> 05:36.965
He has achieved things, actually.
Ken has a wonderful, loving family.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.725
You know who says their greatest
achievement is their family?

05:40.805 --> 05:42.045
Losers.

05:42.125 --> 05:45.325
Usain Bolt doesn't gloat
about his family.

05:45.405 --> 05:48.765
He gloats about being
the fastest man in the world.

05:48.845 --> 05:52.805
And then he does this!
And everyone cheers.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.725
-You once met, you know, what's his name?
-Alan Shearer.

05:55.805 --> 05:58.205
-And he told you what?
-He said I had a firm handshake.

05:58.285 --> 05:59.165
Exactly.

05:59.725 --> 06:01.805
So, everyone ready for tonight?

06:01.885 --> 06:03.845
God, what are you talking about?

06:03.925 --> 06:07.485
Ivy's big divorce party at Chez Chance.

06:09.205 --> 06:12.005
-I'm sure she told you about it.
- She didn't. I wouldn't go anyway.

06:12.085 --> 06:14.725
That wasn't a joke?
It's hard to know when you mean things.

06:14.805 --> 06:17.405
-Because you say a lot of weird stuff.
-Oh, thank you.

06:17.485 --> 06:19.085
You didn't say your divorce
had come through.

06:19.165 --> 06:21.685
Yeah, yesterday.
All done, not a big deal.

06:21.765 --> 06:23.725
Still, 30 years of marriage.

06:23.805 --> 06:26.365
That's what I'm saying,
she needs to mark the moment.

06:26.445 --> 06:28.405
Which is why I'm throwing the shindig

06:28.485 --> 06:31.325
to help her through
that transition into singledom,

06:31.405 --> 06:35.445
and maybe even help her
find a new mate.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.565
Well, if you must.

06:37.645 --> 06:39.085
But, really, it's nothing.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.845
I'm not gonna miss Ron.

06:40.925 --> 06:43.205
His affairs, his love of control,

06:43.285 --> 06:45.965
his fraudulent schemes -
which I didn't know about.

06:46.045 --> 06:48.485
I've invited all the divorcees
from my support group,

06:48.565 --> 06:50.085
so they all know the territory.

06:50.165 --> 06:53.405
I mean, Lucy Merriweather
had a cracking divorce.

06:53.485 --> 06:56.045
I mean, she got the white goods
and everything.
Lucy Merriweather
from the <i>Lichfield Argus</i>?

06:58.765 --> 07:00.085
Well, we won't come.

07:00.165 --> 07:02.885
-She was nasty to Ken.
-There you go again.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.725
-What?
-Holding him back.

07:04.805 --> 07:08.725
-Can't you see this is an opportunity?
-No, I think I fluffed it.

07:09.285 --> 07:12.965
Ken, you're going to go to that party
in an amazing suit,

07:13.045 --> 07:16.445
and you're going to seduce this
Lucy Merriweather into supporting you.

07:16.525 --> 07:19.805
-Now, where's the closest Macy's?
-New York.

07:20.605 --> 07:23.605
-But Moss Bros is open till eight.
-We'll find somewhere.

07:23.685 --> 07:26.605
-Come on, Kenny, let's make you a new man.

07:27.365 --> 07:29.885
-Ah, Lorna, come here.

07:30.925 --> 07:32.285
No, Steve.

07:38.365 --> 07:40.245
I think we should try a pinstripe.

07:40.325 --> 07:44.365
A muted tone, but with a pink thread
and a matching lining.

07:44.445 --> 07:47.365
- Ooh!
-Which one of these catches your eye?

07:47.445 --> 07:49.005
None of them.

07:49.085 --> 07:50.245
This is ridiculous.

07:50.325 --> 07:52.005
Stop resisting, Ken.

07:52.085 --> 07:56.045
We are here to turn you into
the man that you were destined to be,
and that man deserves
a bit of attention.

08:00.165 --> 08:02.965
A bit of luxury, a bit of...

08:03.045 --> 08:04.805
Scotch, sir?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.285
Thank you.

08:09.725 --> 08:11.285
That <i>is </i>peaty.

08:15.005 --> 08:16.445
Show me the blue again.

08:21.205 --> 08:24.765
Lorna, take a look
at your new husband!

08:24.845 --> 08:26.605
Well, hello, Miss Moneypenny.

08:26.685 --> 08:29.085
Ugh! It's hurting my eyes.

08:29.165 --> 08:31.525
-No, I don't like it.
-Come on, Lorn, it's only me.

08:31.605 --> 08:33.885
No, no, don't hug me, Ken!

08:33.965 --> 08:36.325
God! You look... different.

08:36.405 --> 08:38.165
I knew the electric blue
was too much.

08:38.245 --> 08:39.485
It's because I had that Scotch.

08:39.565 --> 08:41.605
I never would have gone for it
if I hadn't had that Scotch.

08:41.685 --> 08:44.925
This is good. Proof of concept.
This is what we want, Ken.

08:45.005 --> 08:47.005
What? For my own wife
to be disgusted by me?

08:47.085 --> 08:50.165
-Yes, Ken!
-You're looking at me like I'm a fart.

08:50.245 --> 08:52.405
Take it off.
Take it off and take it back.

08:52.485 --> 08:54.765
No! This is the dawn of a new Ken.

08:54.845 --> 08:57.685
I don't want new Ken, casino Ken.

08:57.765 --> 08:59.645
I want old Ken, my Ken.

08:59.725 --> 09:01.925
-Take it back, or I'll chop it up.
-Keep it on.

09:02.005 --> 09:04.805
-Keep it on and you win.
-Take it back, Ken.

09:04.885 --> 09:06.765
-Keep it on!
-Take it back!

09:06.845 --> 09:08.685
I feel like a dog being called
by two masters.
-Two?
-Yeah, I'm going to take it back.

09:10.685 --> 09:11.685
Oh!

09:13.085 --> 09:15.165
So, it just tasted really nasty.

09:15.245 --> 09:16.925
Oh, God!

09:17.005 --> 09:19.725
Not like this. This is vermouth.

09:19.805 --> 09:22.205
The unsung hero
of many, many a cocktail.

09:22.285 --> 09:24.925
Sorry, you'll have to excuse me,
I'm just a little bit nervous.

09:25.005 --> 09:27.405
I haven't been on a date
since my last relationship ended.

09:27.485 --> 09:29.565
Well, snap, that makes two of us.

09:30.485 --> 09:33.365
It's good to, you know,
get yourself back out there, isn't it?

09:33.445 --> 09:35.005
-Yeah.
-Pastures new.

09:35.085 --> 09:38.405
Yeah. I like that. To pastures new.

09:38.485 --> 09:40.045
Pastures new.

09:42.005 --> 09:44.085
-Mm.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.605
-I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

09:49.485 --> 09:51.445
Oh, no, I should probably, um...
just get this.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.765
-Do you mind if I...?
-No, go for it.

09:56.165 --> 09:57.525
Hello.

09:57.605 --> 10:00.365
<i>Babe, where are you?</i>
<i>I'm outside yours.</i>

10:00.645 --> 10:03.645
Oh, why?
Tash, what's happened?

10:03.725 --> 10:05.725
I'm having a bit of a crisis with Ben.

10:06.325 --> 10:07.405
Can we have a talk?

10:07.485 --> 10:10.405
I wouldn't ask, it's just you're
the only one I can talk to about this.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.165
Of course. Um...

10:14.725 --> 10:17.925
Just... Yeah, just wait there,
I'll be there in a sec, OK?

10:18.005 --> 10:19.325
Thanks.

10:25.645 --> 10:28.205
Oh, gee, I'm so, so sorry.

10:28.685 --> 10:30.885
Um, I have to go. A friend's in trouble.

10:30.965 --> 10:32.285
No, I get it. Go, go.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.405
Um... I'll give you a call,
maybe we can reschedule some time.

10:35.485 --> 10:36.925
Oh, sorry.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.125
Sorry.

10:54.405 --> 10:57.765
Ken! You look ravishing.

10:57.845 --> 10:59.485
I feel I wanna...

10:59.965 --> 11:01.765
stroke you. Can I?

11:01.845 --> 11:04.445
-Get off me!
-See, it's working.

11:04.525 --> 11:06.845
I feel terrible,
I told Lorna I'd take this back.

11:06.925 --> 11:10.125
You didn't say when.
Come on, give it a test drive.

11:10.205 --> 11:13.125
-What if I spill red wine on it?
-Vomit, more like it.

11:13.205 --> 11:15.885
This party's shaping up
to be quite the rager.

11:15.965 --> 11:17.365
Hm.

11:17.445 --> 11:19.605
Here she is, the belle of the ball.

11:19.685 --> 11:21.485
Happy divorce!

11:21.565 --> 11:23.325
Happy divorce.

11:23.405 --> 11:26.925
They're all here for you, Ivy,
to honour your rebirth into society.

11:27.005 --> 11:30.085
Emerging from the chrysalis of marriage

11:30.165 --> 11:32.565
into a glittering middle-aged debutante.

11:32.645 --> 11:36.285
-Really, Steve, it's not that big a deal.
-It's a huge deal, Ivy.

11:36.365 --> 11:39.325
Today marks the start of your future
and who knows what or...

11:40.365 --> 11:42.045
who your future holds?

11:43.085 --> 11:44.645
Cake?

11:45.885 --> 11:47.525
It's stale, like your love for Ron.

11:49.005 --> 11:51.725
-Some interesting choices for decor.
-Oh, you likey?

11:52.445 --> 11:56.485
Your life-sized Ron Mittelfart piñata!

11:57.045 --> 11:59.245
Care to beat the shit
out of your ex-husband, Ivy?

12:00.645 --> 12:02.485
With a katana?

12:03.725 --> 12:04.965
-Oh.

12:05.805 --> 12:08.045
Thanks, but I don't need to do that.

12:09.325 --> 12:11.525
If someone did to me
what he did to you,

12:11.605 --> 12:13.365
I would wrench the soul
from his body

12:13.445 --> 12:16.165
and cast it into
the eternal pit of damnation, Ivy.

12:16.245 --> 12:19.325
-You say such sweet things.
-Mm.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.925
Would you go make me a drink
and get someone else to bring it over?

12:22.005 --> 12:23.805
Yeah.

12:23.885 --> 12:24.925
Oh.

12:26.165 --> 12:29.245
Lucy's here.
God, I need to impress her.

12:30.365 --> 12:33.325
-Why is she eating sticks?
-They're Twiglets.

12:33.405 --> 12:37.045
Well, go get her, champ.
Remember, it's all about the sizzle.

12:37.125 --> 12:40.525
The sizzle, right.
Remind me what the sizzle is again.

12:40.605 --> 12:42.605
Be the man that wears this suit.

12:42.685 --> 12:44.645
Say the things this suit would say.

12:44.725 --> 12:47.765
OK.
Steve, have you got any Scotch?

12:50.285 --> 12:53.845
Like any successful bachelor,
I have an extensive whisky library.

12:53.925 --> 12:55.285
Oh, God.

12:57.565 --> 12:59.565
Da-da-da-da-da-da...

13:00.885 --> 13:01.925
Ah.

13:03.085 --> 13:04.645
OK.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.805
Wish me luck.

13:13.965 --> 13:16.165
Lucy, I did not know you were here.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.405
Wow! You scrub up well.

13:18.485 --> 13:22.045
-Have you come from a wedding?
- No.

13:22.685 --> 13:24.245
Listen, I wanted to say how sorry I was

13:24.325 --> 13:26.885
the way things panned out
at Wetherspoons the other day.

13:26.965 --> 13:28.205
Me, too.

13:28.285 --> 13:30.965
I've never shared a fish and chips
at a business meeting before.

13:31.045 --> 13:32.245
No.

13:32.325 --> 13:34.125
It does come with a free pint, so...

13:36.325 --> 13:39.925
Anyway, I wanted to take
the opportunity to change your mind

13:40.005 --> 13:41.645
about who you might be supporting.

13:41.725 --> 13:46.045
-OK. I'm listening.
-Here's the thing...

13:46.125 --> 13:48.885
My ex-wife used to call me lots of things.
Poet, bard.

13:49.525 --> 13:51.205
She often used to compliment me
on my penis.

13:51.285 --> 13:53.285
Oh, God!

13:55.925 --> 13:57.125
I'm getting a drink.

13:57.205 --> 13:59.845
Hurry up. Party games! Right.

13:59.925 --> 14:04.365
Now, who wants to play
pin the husband on the Ivy?

14:04.445 --> 14:05.525
Anyone?

14:07.285 --> 14:08.605
Anyone else?

14:12.325 --> 14:14.965
Oh, thanks for coming.
I really got myself in a state.

14:15.045 --> 14:16.845
-So, what happened?
-It's just that I couldn't decide

14:16.925 --> 14:19.845
which waxed jacket to buy Ben
for his birthday.

14:22.605 --> 14:23.845
Right.

14:24.405 --> 14:27.725
Sorry, Tash, um...
Weren't you crying on the phone?

14:27.805 --> 14:31.165
Yeah. Like I said, I just...
I was having a tizzy.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.205
Anyway, you want to drink some wine,
hang out a bit?

14:37.005 --> 14:38.165
Um...

14:38.805 --> 14:42.525
Oh, sh... You were on a date.

14:43.685 --> 14:45.085
Was it going well?

14:46.405 --> 14:48.525
-Not bad.
-Great.

14:49.245 --> 14:51.685
Do you want to go back or...

14:51.765 --> 14:53.005
we can hang?

14:55.645 --> 14:57.325
No, it's OK.

14:57.405 --> 14:58.845
Let's do wine.

14:58.925 --> 15:00.405
Come in.

15:01.445 --> 15:04.245
-Mum, Tash is here!
-Oh, hiya, Tash.

15:07.685 --> 15:09.525
Hello, is that the tailor's?

15:09.925 --> 15:12.405
Yes, I just want to check
that a refund has gone through

15:12.485 --> 15:14.525
because my card's been declined,
and...

15:14.605 --> 15:15.885
Yeah.

15:15.965 --> 15:17.365
Ken Thompson.

15:18.005 --> 15:20.085
That's right, very tall, yes.

15:20.165 --> 15:21.925
Did he return his suit?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.165
He didn't?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.325
He bought what?

15:27.365 --> 15:29.765
Go on, tell me about this boy.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.165
Ooh! Well, er...

15:33.805 --> 15:36.645
I mean, he still remains very fit. Um...

15:36.725 --> 15:38.165
-Oh, I don't know.

15:38.965 --> 15:41.845
-All right, Mum? Where are you going?
-To murder your father.

15:41.925 --> 15:44.605
-Or at least, murder his waistcoat.
-Oh, fair enough.

15:46.685 --> 15:48.325
Oh, they're great, aren't they,
your mum and dad.

15:49.045 --> 15:52.005
Like, they're a couple,
but above all they're best friends.

15:54.725 --> 15:57.045
-Shall we listen to some music?
-Yeah.

15:59.005 --> 16:01.205
-Oh, I love this song.
-Mm!

16:01.285 --> 16:03.045
-Tune!
-Shall we dance?

16:32.045 --> 16:34.485
OK, I'm going to be straight
with you, Lucy.

16:34.565 --> 16:36.605
I am inexperienced
in the politics game.

16:36.685 --> 16:38.205
There's no getting round that,

16:38.285 --> 16:41.365
but I can guarantee you one thing,

16:41.445 --> 16:42.925
honesty.

16:43.005 --> 16:45.165
I'm going to be honest
with my fellow politicians,

16:45.245 --> 16:47.165
I'm going to be honest with you,
the press,

16:47.245 --> 16:49.565
and I'm going to be honest
with the people.

16:49.645 --> 16:51.045
Honest Thompson.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.405
-Ken, you fucking liar!

16:53.485 --> 16:56.205
-Lorna. This is a really bad time.
-Don't you Lorna me.

16:56.285 --> 16:57.805
You said you were going
to take that suit back,

16:57.885 --> 17:00.445
and instead you buy
a flamboyant waistcoat.

17:00.525 --> 17:03.925
-You lied to my face, Ken.
-"Honest Thompson"?

17:04.005 --> 17:05.805
Yes, all right,
I can see the way this is looking.

17:05.885 --> 17:09.325
Lorna, in America,
we call this being an asshole.

17:09.405 --> 17:10.765
And you can shut up, too.

17:10.845 --> 17:13.245
You're nothing but a bad influence.

17:13.325 --> 17:16.805
Filling his head with pipe dreams
and dressing him up like Puff Daddy.

17:16.885 --> 17:17.965
I'm improving him.

17:18.045 --> 17:21.605
Don't you want him to be ambitious?
To provide for you?

17:21.685 --> 17:25.725
I get it, Ivy, your husband's gone
and it sounds like he was a shit.

17:26.485 --> 17:29.485
But that's no reason
to go taking control of mine.

17:29.565 --> 17:31.925
For God's sake, Lorna, it's just a suit.

17:32.005 --> 17:36.565
It's a symbol, Ken,
of what she's doing to our family.

17:36.645 --> 17:38.525
And it ends here.

17:40.285 --> 17:41.725
He's not taking it back.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.045
No, he's not.

17:48.365 --> 17:50.605
-He's taking it off.
-What?

17:51.245 --> 17:54.485
-Take the suit off, Ken.
-What? Not here in front of people.

17:54.565 --> 17:56.565
I said, take the suit off, Ken.

18:01.485 --> 18:02.565
Trousers down.

18:02.645 --> 18:04.285
-Lorn.
-Trousers down!

18:04.365 --> 18:05.445
Trousers.

18:06.965 --> 18:08.085
And the waistcoat.

18:09.525 --> 18:11.685
Now, hold the jacket up.

18:13.645 --> 18:14.565
Lorn!

18:17.485 --> 18:19.165
Aagh-ha!

18:20.325 --> 18:21.885
Agh! Lorna!

18:24.165 --> 18:26.445
Lorna, how did that feel?

18:26.525 --> 18:28.245
Oh, really, really good!

18:28.325 --> 18:29.965
Hand me the sword.
Oh.

18:31.765 --> 18:34.525
Back, everyone!

18:37.245 --> 18:40.485
Aargh!

18:40.565 --> 18:41.605
Take that, Ron!

18:46.005 --> 18:49.365
Oh, yes, baby!

18:55.005 --> 18:57.685
What else can we shred?

18:57.765 --> 19:01.565
-Everything in my shed.
-Yeah! Oh, Lorna, let's go.

19:14.765 --> 19:17.965
You know what, Lorna?
I've really just been trying to help.

19:18.045 --> 19:19.725
I know.

19:19.805 --> 19:23.285
I guess I had a lot of pent-up anger
against Ron, after all.

19:23.365 --> 19:26.725
Yeah, I think you proved that
when you head-butted the lawn mower.

19:32.085 --> 19:33.325
This was fun.

19:34.405 --> 19:37.205
I've never really had a woman friend
in my life before.

19:38.525 --> 19:41.405
I guess there's something
to having a family after all,

19:41.485 --> 19:43.245
even if they live in Ditchfield.

19:44.845 --> 19:46.445
It's Lichfield.

19:47.405 --> 19:48.645
Whatever.

19:49.725 --> 19:51.365
"Whatever!"

19:53.125 --> 19:54.485
"Whatever!"

20:09.765 --> 20:10.725
Dad?

20:13.245 --> 20:14.365
Hi, you two.

20:15.525 --> 20:17.165
Jesus, what happened?

20:17.245 --> 20:18.965
Oh.

20:19.925 --> 20:21.365
I just met a ninja.

20:22.685 --> 20:25.485
-Tell your mum I went to bed.
-All right.

20:33.445 --> 20:34.525
I fell asleep.

20:36.085 --> 20:37.525
Yeah.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.805
I'd better get home.
So, um...

20:54.765 --> 20:56.525
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

21:02.005 --> 21:04.765
I think we need to...
remember Ben.

21:05.925 --> 21:07.565
He's a really good friend and...

21:08.805 --> 21:11.605
-Obviously, what you have is very special.
-Yeah. Ben.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.925
-Night, Rach.
-Night.
