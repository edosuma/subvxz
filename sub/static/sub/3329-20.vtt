00:01.030 --> 00:02.429
WATSON:
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.470 --> 00:05.030
Hannah,
the guy laid hands on you.

00:05.070 --> 00:08.164
I am not nine years old
anymore, Dad.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.407
I want to be promoted
just as bad as the next cop,

00:10.440 --> 00:12.431
and I'm not just talking
about Detective.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.778
I want to be Captain someday,
like you.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.707
But it's never gonna happen
if people look at me

00:18.750 --> 00:20.308
and they see "victim."

00:23.090 --> 00:25.285
HOLMES (on phone):
Watson, you still over there?

00:25.320 --> 00:26.582
Yes, I'm still here,

00:26.620 --> 00:28.451
because I can't go home,
because of you.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.219
Why did you bring the bees
in the house anyway?

00:30.260 --> 00:32.694
Varroa mites are a pernicious
threat to the colony.

00:32.730 --> 00:34.425
I intended
a thorough inspection,

00:34.460 --> 00:36.223
as well as an application
of baker's sugar

00:36.270 --> 00:37.692
as a preventative measure.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.698
My thoughts were concerned
with colony collapse.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.469
I failed to see
the more urgent threat

00:41.500 --> 00:42.831
of table collapse.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.360
Wait a second.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.503
You're not talking
about my table, are you?

00:46.540 --> 00:48.428
The one that I bought
for my apartment?

00:48.480 --> 00:50.573
Two hours should be sufficient
to return the hive to stasis.

00:50.610 --> 00:52.168
I'll be in touch.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.245
(sighs)
Do you have a roommate?

00:54.280 --> 00:56.111
Nah.
Dothetone.
Even

00:56.150 --> 00:57.845
Trouble in paradise?

00:57.890 --> 01:00.188
Well, nothing a good
exterminator couldn't solve.

01:00.220 --> 01:01.653
Tonight still
a good night to talk?

01:01.690 --> 01:03.248
Yeah, let's just
get out of here.

01:03.290 --> 01:05.679
I need coffee that
wasn't made by a cop.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.759
HANNAH:
Three neighborhood
drugstores,

01:08.800 --> 01:10.165
all in my precinct,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.395
all robbed in
the last month.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.167
None of _the stores
had security cameras

01:16.210 --> 01:17.837
but all the robberies
took place

01:17.870 --> 01:19.508
right when the owners were
closing up for the night.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.100
Descriptions of the perps
match in all three,

01:22.150 --> 01:23.777
and also, they only took
prescription pills.

01:23.810 --> 01:27.109
High street value.
Oxy, hydrocodone.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.072
Sounds like it was all done
by the same crew.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.308
I've been re-interviewing
witnesses,

01:32.360 --> 01:34.157
putting in extra hours,

01:34.190 --> 01:35.885
keeping an eye
on the other stores.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.480
But, uh...
I'm not making much headway.

01:38.530 --> 01:41.795
Is there a detective
on this case?

01:41.830 --> 01:43.695
Hanford.

01:45.430 --> 01:48.558
I'm not trying
to step on his toes, I'm...

01:48.600 --> 01:50.261
I don't want to be
disrespectful, but...

01:52.340 --> 01:54.729
...but his plate's
kind of full right now.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.143
It's my neighborhood.

01:58.180 --> 01:59.340
My partner and I, we...

01:59.380 --> 02:00.540
we have to look these people

02:00.580 --> 02:02.548
in the eye every day.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.148
They're scared.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.511
It would,
it would mean a lot to them--

02:06.560 --> 02:09.154
a lot to me--
ifI could bring this one home.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.259
All right.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.699
I'll take a look.

02:13.730 --> 02:15.721
Um, I'll let you know
if anything comes up.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.408
MAN:
I know it's late here.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.171
Uh, well, you wanted
to go to school out west, no?

02:26.210 --> 02:28.770
Or is it just that
I'm keeping you from a party?

02:33.380 --> 02:34.779
(tires screeching)

02:36.390 --> 02:37.618
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.356
Yeah, some drunk
and he almost hit me.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.709
No, no, no, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.421
I guess the bars
must be letting out.

02:45.630 --> 02:47.928
(crossing bell clanging)

02:55.670 --> 02:57.331
What the hell?

02:57.370 --> 02:58.632
(honks horn)

02:58.670 --> 03:00.877
(train horn blaring
from distance)

03:00.910 --> 03:03.299
Hey!

03:04.650 --> 03:06.208
Hey!

03:08.280 --> 03:09.486
Hey, man, what's wrong?

03:09.520 --> 03:10.714
Let's go.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.550
(train horn continues blaring)

03:16.590 --> 03:17.818
(grunts)

03:36.450 --> 03:38.600
What a drunk idiot.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.675
I tell you, man...

03:40.720 --> 03:42.642
you had an angel
looking out for you tonight.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.523
You said
you knew this guy.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.788
I was an admirer.

04:24.830 --> 04:27.321
Garrison Boyd
was president

04:27.360 --> 04:28.998
of the Five Boroughs
Skeptics Association.

04:29.030 --> 04:31.919
He was a debunker
of the highest order.

04:31.970 --> 04:33.790
He was a bright
light of reason

04:33.840 --> 04:35.899
in a sea of gullibility
and magical thought.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.000
He was a professional doubter.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.473
Of...?

04:41.510 --> 04:43.398
Pseudoscience,
the paranormal,

04:43.450 --> 04:46.647
organized religion--
all the usual bollocks.

04:46.680 --> 04:48.511
He wrote a blog that
I rather enjoyed.

04:48.550 --> 04:50.040
Did he believe in crowbars?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.682
'Cause I'm pretty sure

04:51.720 --> 04:53.551
that's what caved
his skull in.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.098
You put the time of death
at approximately one hour

05:02.130 --> 05:03.722
before his car was found.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.590
I'm guessing whoever killed him

05:05.630 --> 05:07.097
was hoping that
the impact of the train

05:07.140 --> 05:08.630
would hide the real
cause of death.

05:10.140 --> 05:12.005
It says here
you removed

05:12.040 --> 05:14.577
a small, conical object from
beneath his right eye socket.

05:14.610 --> 05:17.499
After he was struck,
he fell forward.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.474
This got wedged
under his eye

05:20.520 --> 05:21.839
on the way down.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.848
Don't know
what it is, yet,

05:23.890 --> 05:25.881
but I'm sending it
to the lab.
It's the tip of a hat.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.482
You are familiar
with the vile practice

05:29.530 --> 05:30.986
of lawn ornamentation?

05:31.030 --> 05:32.725
The worst offenders
employ garden gnomes,

05:32.760 --> 05:34.057
yea big, white beards...

05:34.100 --> 05:36.125
Pointy red hats.
If he wasn't
so dead,

05:36.160 --> 05:38.628
I suspect Mr. Boyd
would find it ironic

05:38.670 --> 05:40.069
that a diminutive wood spirit

05:40.100 --> 05:42.068
played a role in his murder.

05:44.670 --> 05:47.002
He was particularly aggressive
in his pursuit of those

05:47.040 --> 05:50.407
who sought to profit
from their hoaxes,

05:50.450 --> 05:53.044
so... perhaps his persistence

05:53.080 --> 05:55.014
is the reason
he now lies here.

05:55.050 --> 05:57.041
You really think being debunked
is a reason to kill somebody?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.888
Some of the most aggressive
correspondence on his Web site

05:59.920 --> 06:02.081
came from local
ghost tour operators,

06:02.120 --> 06:04.122
hawkers of phony
medical cures...

06:04.160 --> 06:06.492
I think one recent
expos target

06:06.530 --> 06:09.795
might have not so much
a reasonable motive for murder

06:09.830 --> 06:12.162
as a lower standard
for committing one.

06:12.200 --> 06:14.998
'Cause_ he's almost
certainly Insane.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.359
(door opens)

06:18.870 --> 06:20.599
I won't pretend
that Mr. Boyd and I

06:20.640 --> 06:22.744
didn't have
a contentious relationship.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.704
He took issue with the church
on more than one occasron.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.741
You mean, he took
issue with your cult.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.848
He misused that
term, as well.

06:31.890 --> 06:34.051
That's just the kind of rigid,
closed-minded thinking

06:34.090 --> 06:35.614
that I preach against here.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.025
At one time or another,

06:37.060 --> 06:38.948
every great religion
has been attacked

06:38.990 --> 06:40.491
as a cult.
Mm.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.724
So have most cults.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.663
Excuse me for a minute,
would you?

06:47.700 --> 06:49.031
Where are you...?

06:49.070 --> 06:51.561
Look, the victim published
almost two dozen

06:51.610 --> 06:53.532
threatening responses
you sent him,

06:53.580 --> 06:54.979
after he posted a few articles

06:55.010 --> 06:57.205
criticizing the church's
recruitment methods.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.445
Well, I have
the right to respond,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.675
if somebody publishes lies about
what we're trying to do here.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.938
You told Mr. Boyd
that his attacks had

07:03.990 --> 07:06.117
begun a chain reaction
that would lead to

07:06.150 --> 07:09.051
"his removal
from this physical reality."

07:09.090 --> 07:10.921
We meditate here.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.099
We practice energy transference.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.995
So when I wrote to him,
I was merely

07:15.030 --> 07:16.964
absorbing his hateful energy

07:17.000 --> 07:18.729
and reflecting it back.

07:18.770 --> 07:20.931
Did I harm him
physically? No.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.835
Did I appeal
to the Quantum Source

07:22.870 --> 07:24.861
for swift and final justice?
Perhaps.

07:24.910 --> 07:27.105
In other words, you prayed
for the guy to die.

07:27.140 --> 07:29.608
That's not a crime,
is it?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.242
So we're done here.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.669
The church held a 12-hour
service last night.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.119
Attendance
was mandatory,

07:35.150 --> 07:38.085
so no one here could have
killed Garrison Boyd.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.849
We're just taking
your new friend's word for it?

07:39.890 --> 07:41.710
Her name is Aria.
And yes, we are.

07:41.760 --> 07:42.988
When it became clear
that this one

07:43.030 --> 07:44.554
would do little _more
than proselytIze,

07:44.590 --> 07:47.252
I scanned his herd
and realized that Aria

07:47.300 --> 07:48.756
was having second thoughts
about being here.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.722
Aria's a Level Three Conduit.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.226
After a brief
conversation with Aria,

07:52.270 --> 07:54.591
AKA Elizabeth Weinberg,

07:54.640 --> 07:56.267
I was able to determine

07:56.300 --> 07:58.006
that some unresolved
issues from her childhood

07:58.040 --> 08:00.600
had led to a transference
of a need for structure

08:00.640 --> 08:02.176
and discipline
onto Mr. Finn.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.609
Elizabeth agreed, and
has forthwith terminated

08:03.650 --> 08:04.844
her relationship
with your church.

08:04.880 --> 08:05.972
What?
BELL:
So wait a second.

08:06.010 --> 08:07.819
Are you saying
you deprogrammed her?

08:07.850 --> 08:10.045
_ I would never use such a
rIgId and closed-minded term.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.887
She did, however, share
some useful information

08:11.920 --> 08:13.114
on the church's methods.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.048
Apparently, their
esteemed leader

08:15.090 --> 08:17.524
_likes to send
hIS acolytes out

08:17.560 --> 08:19.528
to follow, photograph
and harass people

08:19.560 --> 08:21.050
who dare to criticize him.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.988
So she's currently
in your office,

08:23.030 --> 08:25.225
e-mailing me the dossier
you compiled on Garrison Boyd.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.033
I'm hopeful it will, uh,
shed some additional light

08:27.070 --> 08:29.288
on his final days.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.160
Ms. Weinberg is
leaving with us.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.202
Any attempt to hinder her
return to her former life

08:34.240 --> 08:37.038
will be met with an energy
transference most unpleasant.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.910
Joan.

08:41.950 --> 08:43.178
Oh, hey.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.812
Heard you were helping
Hannah with something.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.681
Yeah, there's been
some robberies

08:46.720 --> 08:48.085
in her precinct.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.678
She wants to help.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.981
You sure
it's not a bother?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.179
No, not at all.

08:52.230 --> 08:53.754
I got into it
this morning

08:53.800 --> 08:55.097
and now I'm
helping Sherlock

08:55.130 --> 08:56.597
with this homicide
he's working.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.790
Hmm.

08:57.830 --> 08:58.524
Just make sure she knows

08:58.570 --> 09:00.561
whose consultant
you really are.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.238
All right.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.148
So when were you
going to inform me

09:13.180 --> 09:15.148
that we're assisting
Hannah Gregson on a case?

09:15.180 --> 09:17.148
You could hear
all that?

09:17.190 --> 09:19.283
We aren't helping her, okay?

09:19.320 --> 09:20.719
Iam.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.352
And it's not a secret.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.880
I'm just gonna run down
a lead or two.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.079
It shouldn't take too much time.

09:25.130 --> 09:26.620
It took time this morning.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.719
So is this everything
from the church?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.263
It is a testament to the
insidiousness of cult thinking:

09:31.300 --> 09:34.235
A charismatic _|oon like Einn
warps ImpreSSIonable minds

09:34.270 --> 09:37.364
and then sends them
to stalk and harass.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.106
And here I thought they just
sold flowers at the airport.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.903
I find the practice repulsive,

09:41.940 --> 09:44.044
but in this case, it may have
played in our favor.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.877
Two cult members
were assrgned

09:45.910 --> 09:48.242
to Garrison Boyd
in the weeks before his murder.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.181
Thanks to their long lenses
and meticulous

09:51.220 --> 09:53.051
note-ta king,
we may have

09:53.090 --> 09:55.012
a person of interest...

09:55.060 --> 09:57.881
a man by the name
of Collin Eisely.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.188
EISELY:
I'm sorry,

10:01.230 --> 10:03.266
I need to catch up
a little, here.

10:03.300 --> 10:05.120
Have I been_ under
police surveillance?

10:05.170 --> 10:07.934
No, those were taken by someone
who was interested in that man,

10:07.970 --> 10:09.335
Garrison Boyd.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.201
HOLMES: We have hundreds
of photographs of him,

10:11.240 --> 10:12.878
in all manner
of actIVItIes,

10:12.910 --> 10:14.673
Those, however,
are the only ones

10:14.710 --> 10:16.746
where he appears to be in heated
altercation with a man

10:16.780 --> 10:18.998
two days before he was murdered.

10:19.050 --> 10:20.074
This guy was murdered?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.417
Last night.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.213
Do you want to tell us
how you knew him?

10:23.250 --> 10:24.740
I didn't.

10:24.790 --> 10:26.758
Uh... the day these were taken,

10:26.790 --> 10:28.155
he was waiting for me
outside my building.

10:28.190 --> 10:29.987
I'd never seen him before.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.428
I'm confused.

10:33.460 --> 10:36.429
Does being accosted by a lunatic
make me a murder suspect?

10:36.460 --> 10:38.223
Well, that depends on
why he accosted you.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.960
I'm in real estate.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.433
Late last year, I looked

10:43.470 --> 10:45.358
at some beach properties
out on Long Island.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.799
I made this woman an offer
on her house, she said no.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.808
A few months later,

10:49.850 --> 10:52.045
this nut comes
out of the woodwork

10:52.080 --> 10:55.117
and accuses me of trying
to scare her into moving.

10:55.150 --> 10:56.686
Scare her how?

10:56.720 --> 10:57.982
According to him,

10:58.020 --> 10:59.988
she was hearing things
in her house.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.148
Voices, banging,
I don't know.

11:03.190 --> 11:05.988
She thought it was ghosts,
he thought it was me.
Was it?

11:06.030 --> 11:07.725
(laughing):
Of course not.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.126
She didn't want to sell,
I moved on-- end of story.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.467
Ah.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.331
I see you've
amassed, um,

11:13.370 --> 11:15.338
quite an art collection
here, Mr. Eisely.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.861
That's an interest that
requrres a great deal of money

11:17.910 --> 11:19.730
and a very
competitive spirit.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.202
I imagine you're not
the sort of person

11:21.240 --> 11:22.946
who takes "no"
for an answer very often.

11:22.980 --> 11:24.299
I'm also not the sort

11:24.350 --> 11:25.806
who goes around scaring
little old ladies.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.818
Can you tell us
where you were last night

11:27.850 --> 11:30.148
between the hours
of 10:00 pm. and midnight?

11:30.190 --> 11:32.146
At a retirement party
for a friend.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.784
A few of us went out
for drinks after that.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.852
I'll get you
their names and numbers.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.098
If that guy was interested
in the property,

11:47.140 --> 11:49.768
there's a possibility
that other developers were, too.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.779
You're wondering if one
of them gaslit the owner,

11:52.810 --> 11:55.176
then killed Boyd,
lest he expose them?

11:55.210 --> 11:58.373
Makes more sense_
than ghosts, doesn't It?

11:58.410 --> 12:02.779
WOMAN: Well, I wouldn't say
"ghosts," plural.

12:03.950 --> 12:06.783
It was my husband, Harry.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.788
I know because
I heard him.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.219
He was talking to me.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.357
Your husband
passed away...?

12:13.400 --> 12:16.153
Oh, coming up
on a year now.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.168
We know that Colin Eisely
made an offer

12:18.200 --> 12:20.031
on the house a few months ago.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.799
Did anyone else approach you?

12:21.840 --> 12:24.138
Yes, once, but-but that was
almost 20 years go.

12:24.170 --> 12:27.071
I don't think that company is
even in business now.

12:27.110 --> 12:30.204
Did you tell anyone else about
the voices you were hearing?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.899
Only my daughter.
(chuckles)

12:31.950 --> 12:35.249
She was the one who called
that poor man, Mr. Boyd.

12:35.280 --> 12:39.239
And she wanted him to convince
me that I was Imagining things.

12:39.290 --> 12:43.249
She has such
a literal mind.

12:43.290 --> 12:45.929
I've always told her
she should be more open.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.518
So she didn't
hear the voice.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.564
And she never heard any
of Harry's tantrums, either.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.567
Tantrums?

12:52.600 --> 12:54.568
He knocked some glasses

12:54.600 --> 12:56.090
out of that cabinet there.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.835
Lights flickered.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.009
Sometimes, he shook
the whole house.

13:01.410 --> 13:04.470
Oh, he was angry,
and he was letting me know.

13:04.510 --> 13:07.513
And why would he
have been angry?

13:07.550 --> 13:11.384
Sometimes we had
an open marriage.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.287
Other times we didn't.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.958
And when we didn't,

13:15.990 --> 13:17.981
I did some things
that I never told him about.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.123
And now that
he's dead,

13:20.160 --> 13:22.094
he knows everything.

13:22.130 --> 13:24.394
That's quite a one-two punch,
isn't it?

13:24.430 --> 13:26.990
Discovering you're dead
and a cuckold.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.134
It doesn't bother me
that you don't believe me.

13:30.170 --> 13:35.130
I fear that I, too, may be
cursed with a literal mind.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.001
If, however, you are not
experiencing delusions,

13:38.050 --> 13:39.540
it may be possible
that someone is trying

13:39.580 --> 13:41.138
to take advantage of you.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.513
You said Harry spoke to you--
what did he say?

13:44.550 --> 13:47.018
I have it on tape.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.051
You could listen
for yourself.

13:51.490 --> 13:55.028
The clearest I_ever heard
Harry's mm was

13:55.060 --> 13:56.891
when I was down here,

13:56.930 --> 13:59.899
so I started leaving my
tape recorder on all the time.

13:59.940 --> 14:04.331
You have to turn the volume all
the way up to hear his v0ice.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.100
(man speaks indistinctly)

14:09.140 --> 14:10.448
"Imm huh-rahn"?

14:10.480 --> 14:11.970
No, no.

14:12.010 --> 14:13.546
He's saying a name.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.548
Jim Harmon.

14:15.580 --> 14:18.140
That's the man I had
the affair with.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.488
Harry really shook
the whole house that night.

14:20.520 --> 14:23.978
And_then_ he started
yelling Jim's name.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.318
(tape rewinding)

14:26.360 --> 14:27.622
(rewind stops, buttons click)

14:29.360 --> 14:31.362
(man speaks indistinctly)

14:32.940 --> 14:35.465
Well, do you still think
I'm imagining things?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.365
I apologize,
Mrs. Renziger.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.469
You most certainly
are not.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.478
You mentioned that some
glasses were knocked

14:41.510 --> 14:43.478
off the cabinet
upstairs.

14:43.510 --> 14:46.070
That cabinet rests
against this wall, yes?

14:46.110 --> 14:47.475
Yes, the living room
is right above it.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.926
How well do you know
your neighbors?

15:04.970 --> 15:06.426
Jerry and Paula?

15:06.470 --> 15:08.597
They moved in here
about the same time as I did.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.505
But they're snowbirds.

15:10.540 --> 15:13.179
They won't be back from Florida
for a few more weeks.

15:13.210 --> 15:17.169
Oh, uh, good neighbors
often exchange keys.

15:17.210 --> 15:19.542
Are you a good neighbor,
Mrs. Renziger?

15:22.620 --> 15:25.111
The voice on the recording
did not say "Jim Harmon,"

15:25.150 --> 15:27.459
it said "im haram."

15:27.490 --> 15:29.981
It's_a common
Arabic obscenity.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.657
So you think
that voice was coming

15:31.690 --> 15:34.193
from all the way over here
in the neighbor's basement.

15:34.230 --> 15:37.222
No, I think someone shortened
the distance considerably.

15:39.700 --> 15:43.261
Along with the voice,
I heard a distinct banging

15:43.310 --> 15:46.268
and a low rumbling
frequency on the recording.

15:46.310 --> 15:49.279
That, along with the rest
of Mrs. Renziger's account,

15:49.310 --> 15:52.609
the, uh, vibrations,
the flickering lights,

15:52.650 --> 15:56.142
all suggest
that someone was employing

15:56.180 --> 15:59.183
digging equipment near
the foundation of her home.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.426
There were no signs
of digging outside,

16:04.460 --> 16:06.451
So you think it was all
happening down here?

16:22.210 --> 16:24.201
Is that a tunnel?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.089
With a termination point

16:30.120 --> 16:32.987
somewhere near_ the foundation
of Mrs. Ren2iger's home.

16:34.290 --> 16:35.587
Why would someone
do all this,

16:35.620 --> 16:37.622
dig from this
basement to hers?

16:38.660 --> 16:40.651
I know a way to find out.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.315
Did you find anything?

17:03.350 --> 17:05.489
I have, indeed.

17:05.520 --> 17:10.219
Mrs. Renziger was not visited
by her husband's ghost.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.127
She may, however, have been
visited by terrorists.

17:21.600 --> 17:24.068
Meet "Ruby."

17:24.110 --> 17:25.839
She's a transatlantic
data cable.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.701
The fastest
in the world

17:31.110 --> 17:32.338
She looks like
a garden hose.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.847
It's a curse
of the modern age

17:33.880 --> 17:35.711
that very significant things
appear commonplace.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.241
Now, Ruby is one of
several undersea cables

17:38.290 --> 17:40.679
which connects Europe
to the United States.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.689
The full spectrum of commerce
and communication flows

17:43.730 --> 17:45.584
through her optic fibers,

17:45.630 --> 17:48.451
as well as the requisite glut
of pornography and cat videos.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.129
And you knew that was
what that cable was how?

17:52.170 --> 17:54.468
The location of such
cables is mapped.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.333
They're accessible
with very little effort.

17:57.370 --> 18:00.339
The intent is to avoid
entanglements

18:00.380 --> 18:03.349
and utility mishaps,
but it also makes them

18:03.380 --> 18:06.770
amongst the most vulnerable
terrorist targets in the world.

18:06.810 --> 18:09.779
And this basement's probably a
pretty smart place to dig from.

18:09.820 --> 18:12.380
And anywhere along the beach
would attract attention,

18:12.420 --> 18:14.285
out in the ocean would
be a lot harder.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.151
And the cable ties
into a landing house

18:16.190 --> 18:17.521
another quarter
of a mile inland,

18:17.560 --> 18:20.120
at which point security
increases markedly.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.525
What our attackers did not
account for was

18:21.560 --> 18:23.425
the intrusion of Garrison Boyd.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.665
Right, so someone runs
tunneling equipment

18:25.700 --> 18:28.134
out of the Ayers' basement while
they're away for the winter.

18:28.170 --> 18:30.138
Mrs. Renziger
hears the noise

18:30.170 --> 18:31.501
and thinks it's
her dead husband,

18:31.540 --> 18:33.508
so her daughter asks
Boyd to prove otherwise,

18:33.540 --> 18:35.838
and then Boyd finds all this,
same way you and Joan did?

18:41.850 --> 18:43.818
This little fella was

18:43.850 --> 18:45.818
amongst the gardening
equipment over there.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.579
The tip of his hat is missing.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.786
Mr. Boyd was murdered
in this room.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.651
The killer loads the body
into Boyd's car,

18:55.700 --> 18:57.725
drives it back into the city,
but then what?

18:57.770 --> 19:00.159
Why not come back
and cut the cable?

19:00.200 --> 19:02.691
Figured Boyd found them, someone
else might be coming, too?

19:02.740 --> 19:03.809
HOLMES:
Perhaps.

19:03.840 --> 19:04.932
Or perhaps the fact

19:04.970 --> 19:06.608
that Ruby has not been cut

19:06.640 --> 19:08.437
signals a much greater threat.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.608
The Internet is designed
with redundancies.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.471
Cutting a single cable would
no doubt cause some problems,

19:14.520 --> 19:16.374
but a coordinated attack,

19:16.420 --> 19:18.240
that could be crippling.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.918
You think there might be other
guys digging up other cables,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.383
waiting for a signal to
cut them all at once?

19:23.430 --> 19:25.921
I think it's a possibility
that we should consider.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.222
I'll reach out to DHS.

19:27.260 --> 19:30.320
Let them know
what's going on.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.902
I'll check back with you.

19:39.740 --> 19:40.877
So, you were right.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.401
Whoever dug that tunnel stuck
mostly to the basement.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.940
But they did come up here
every now and then.

19:44.980 --> 19:46.641
Yes, naturally.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.978
If the man or men or women
were here to do arduous work,

19:49.020 --> 19:50.510
the hours would have
beenlong.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.381
They would have needed
to eat, hydrate

19:52.420 --> 19:53.978
and, of course,
expel waste.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.681
Toilet seat was up,
so I'm guessing

19:55.720 --> 19:57.221
at least one
person was a "he."

19:57.260 --> 20:00.252
Also we found this
in the fridge.

20:01.460 --> 20:03.462
"Doogh."

20:03.500 --> 20:06.867
Carbonated yogurt drink
popular in Arab countries.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.391
It's hard to believe bubbling
yogurt is popular anywhere.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.930
I figured it didn't
belong to the Ayers,

20:10.970 --> 20:12.460
so I called the
American distributor.

20:12.510 --> 20:14.000
No place on the
island sells it.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.530
Six stores in
the city do.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.878
They're e-mailing
me a list.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.878
So assuming these stores
have surveillance cameras,

20:19.910 --> 20:22.879
we can check their footage
from the last few weeks,

20:22.920 --> 20:25.309
see if anyone
jumps out.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.386
WATSON: Hannah, come in.

20:27.420 --> 20:29.411
(door closes)

20:31.430 --> 20:33.250
So I have good news.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.927
Don't tell me
you solved it already.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.463
Actually, you already
had all the pieces.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.320
Now, you said that all three
drugstores were robbed

20:39.370 --> 20:40.837
around closing time.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.259
At first, I assumed
what you probably did.

20:43.310 --> 20:46.268
That it was because closing is
when a store is most vulnerable.

20:46.310 --> 20:49.279
No customers, fewer employees,
most cash on hand.

20:49.310 --> 20:51.949
But in this case, there
was something else.

20:51.980 --> 20:53.948
Now, two of the
pharmacists told you

20:53.980 --> 20:55.641
that a candy machine
vendor had come by

20:55.680 --> 20:57.318
just before
the robberies.

20:57.350 --> 20:59.318
I checked,

20:59.350 --> 21:01.784
and _that same vendor has
machines in all three stores.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.481
You think the_ vendor's
in on it.

21:03.530 --> 21:04.883
He scopes out
the stores

21:04.930 --> 21:06.886
and then tells his accomplices
if it's all clear.

21:06.930 --> 21:09.819
A friend took these today.

21:09.860 --> 21:12.567
Vending machine company
uses this warehouse

21:12.600 --> 21:14.534
to store their inventory
and do repairs.

21:14.570 --> 21:15.696
Look at these guys.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.959
Height, hair color,
visible tattoos.

21:19.010 --> 21:21.979
They match the descriptions
of the three perps.

21:22.010 --> 21:24.774
They definitely don't look like
they're in the gumball business.

21:24.810 --> 21:25.970
Hmm.

21:26.010 --> 21:27.375
You found them.

21:27.420 --> 21:28.569
I can't believe it.

21:28.620 --> 21:29.973
I mean, H can.
I'm not surprised.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.385
But thank you.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.456
Odds are,

21:33.490 --> 21:34.980
this is where they're storing
the stolen pills.

21:35.020 --> 21:36.908
When you bring this
to Detective Hanford,

21:36.960 --> 21:38.587
feel free to leave
my name out of it.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.983
But my guess is, the
department's gonna want

21:40.030 --> 21:42.590
to sit on this
place for a while.
Why?

21:42.630 --> 21:43.995
As long as it
doesn't look like

21:44.030 --> 21:45.588
another robbery
is imminent,

21:45.630 --> 21:46.961
they're gonna want
to follow the drugs

21:47.000 --> 21:49.468
up the food chain.
With the amount of pills

21:49.500 --> 21:51.604
these guys are stealing, they
probably have help moving them.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.609
So this could lead
to bigger fish.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.868
(sighs)

21:59.910 --> 22:02.617
It took no small amount
of negotiation, but I was able

22:02.650 --> 22:05.016
to procure security footage
from each of the Doogh-selling

22:05.050 --> 22:06.813
ethnic markets
that you identified.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.011
Now, taking into account
the hours Claire Renziger

22:09.060 --> 22:11.551
did and did not hear "ghosts,"

22:11.590 --> 22:13.353
it would appear
that our tunneler kept hours

22:13.400 --> 22:14.890
between 8:00 to 6:00.

22:14.930 --> 22:17.023
So it stands to reason
that he bought his Doogh

22:17.060 --> 22:18.561
and other provisions
at either the beginning

22:18.600 --> 22:19.760
or the end of each day.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.360
Oh, that's great.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.958
It'll help us move
through these faster.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.399
Assuming, of course, you're not
still splitting your time

22:26.440 --> 22:27.805
between the tribulations
of a beat cop

22:27.840 --> 22:29.535
and the hunt
for a likely terrorist.

22:29.580 --> 22:32.401
May I remind you that "beat cop"
is our boss's daughter?

22:32.450 --> 22:33.678
Is that why
you were helping her?

22:33.720 --> 22:34.971
To curry favor?

22:35.020 --> 22:36.976
I'm helping her
because she asked me.

22:37.020 --> 22:38.942
What do you think of her?

22:38.990 --> 22:40.457
Hannah?

22:40.490 --> 22:41.912
She's nice.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.985
I mean, what do you think of her
as an investigator?

22:44.030 --> 22:45.918
Oh, she's green.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.393
I mean, she's
dedicated.

22:47.430 --> 22:48.328
She did all the legwork,

22:48.360 --> 22:49.520
she just couldn't
connect all the dots.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.959
Why?
Oh, it just confirms

22:51.000 --> 22:52.399
a long-held suspicion.

22:52.430 --> 22:53.738
She's middling.

22:53.770 --> 22:55.658
Hold on, I did not say
she was "middling."

22:55.700 --> 22:57.804
And that's sad, because she is
the daughter of a colleague

22:57.840 --> 23:00.400
and he has certain aspirations
for her.
Excuse me,

23:00.440 --> 23:02.135
but have you ever
even talked to Hannah?

23:02.180 --> 23:03.875
Twice.
That's it?

23:03.910 --> 23:05.172
And that all you needed
to size her up?

23:05.210 --> 23:06.905
I also looked at her records.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.611
Understand, Watson:

23:08.650 --> 23:10.447
I think she's a perfectly
capable police officer.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.412
She knows how to handle herself
in a confrontation

23:12.450 --> 23:13.986
and_ she's first-rate
With a weapon.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.079
What I fear she is not, however,
is a detective.

23:16.120 --> 23:17.724
(scoffs)
Give me a break.

23:17.760 --> 23:18.920
It's a calling, Watson;

23:18.960 --> 23:20.052
no one knows that
better than you.

23:20.090 --> 23:22.024
I learned because you taught me.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.823
I taught you
because I saw something.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.997
What if I told you
I see something in Hannah?

23:26.030 --> 23:27.634
I would tell you
you're mistaken.

23:27.670 --> 23:28.864
You know what?

23:28.900 --> 23:30.606
I'll be in my room.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.100
(exhales)

23:49.090 --> 23:50.819
(line ringing)

23:52.230 --> 23:54.027
HOLMES:
Thought I'd let you sleep in.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.994
You found my notes?

23:56.030 --> 23:58.521
Well, sort of
hard to miss.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.629
Watched the video?

24:00.670 --> 24:01.989
I take it this is our suspect?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.598
Note the coveralls.

24:03.640 --> 24:05.005
The tape that you're watching

24:05.040 --> 24:08.908
records his fifth appearance
at the store

24:08.940 --> 24:10.578
in a span of two weeks.

24:10.610 --> 24:12.475
During that period of time,

24:12.510 --> 24:14.478
his clothes get
progressively dirtier,

24:14.520 --> 24:16.977
save for two rectangular spots
on his knees.

24:17.020 --> 24:18.612
Presumably,
he wore some knee pads

24:18.650 --> 24:20.015
while he was digging his tunnel.

24:20.050 --> 24:21.984
Well, "presumably"
isn't "definitely."

24:22.020 --> 24:23.749
He may just be a plumber.

24:23.790 --> 24:25.587
And I see he didn't
use his credit card.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.598
As is his wont. Unfortunately,
he can't be identified

24:27.630 --> 24:28.858
via receipts.

24:28.900 --> 24:29.924
The woman in the red coat,
however...

24:29.960 --> 24:31.928
She knows him.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.790
She paid with
her American Express.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.489
Her name is Yolanda Massee

24:35.540 --> 24:37.861
and I'm stepping
into her elevator as we speak.

24:37.910 --> 24:40.834
I'll call you when I know more.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.508
WOMAN :
Yes?

24:46.550 --> 24:47.778
Hello. Ms. Massee?

24:47.820 --> 24:49.515
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.518
I'm a consultant with
the New York Police Department.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.040
I was hoping I might
ask you a few questions.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.159
Do you have a badge?

24:54.190 --> 24:55.509
I'm afraid I'm quite allergic

24:55.560 --> 24:57.209
to iconography.
I was just--

24:57.260 --> 24:59.023
I was hoping you might be able
to tell me this man's name.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.891
(laughs)
Is this a joke?

25:00.930 --> 25:02.750
No.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.121
I think it's Nazim or Nadim...

25:05.170 --> 25:06.523
I'm not really sure.

25:06.570 --> 25:07.764
But you know him?

25:07.800 --> 25:08.994
I don't know.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.598
How well do you know
your neighbors?

25:10.640 --> 25:11.766
He's your neighbor?

25:11.810 --> 25:13.038
He lives right there.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.845
I'd recommend you leave
your building right now.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.289
What? Why?

25:25.320 --> 25:26.981
'Cause your neighbor
heard us talking...

25:27.020 --> 25:28.578
(alarm ringing)

25:28.620 --> 25:30.019
...and he is currently dousing

25:30.060 --> 25:31.823
his apartment with accelerant.

25:31.860 --> 25:33.054
Go on!

25:36.030 --> 25:38.999
Nadim? Or is it Nazim?

25:39.030 --> 25:40.224
You might find this
hard to believe,

25:40.270 --> 25:41.737
but I'm-I'm actually
here to help you.

25:41.770 --> 25:42.839
Don't come any closer.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.662
You're not a terrorist at all,
are you?

25:46.710 --> 25:47.870
No.

25:47.910 --> 25:49.878
Look, I'm open
to the possibility

25:49.910 --> 25:51.707
that Garrison Boyd's death
was an accident.

25:51.750 --> 25:54.218
He caught you unawares
and-and you panicked.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.070
But if you drop that lighter,

25:56.120 --> 25:58.918
you will be attempting murder
on the 200 or so other people

25:58.950 --> 26:00.247
who live in this building.

26:00.290 --> 26:02.019
(alarm continues ringing)

26:18.240 --> 26:19.605
HOLMES:
This...

26:19.640 --> 26:22.074
this contraption
was at the heart

26:22.110 --> 26:24.772
of the drawings
on Nadim Al-Haj's walls.

26:24.810 --> 26:27.040
I only had a moment
to absorb them before they were

26:27.080 --> 26:28.377
engulfed in flames,

26:28.420 --> 26:31.218
but it was clear
that he never intended

26:31.250 --> 26:32.786
to sever the cable
that he excavated.

26:32.820 --> 26:34.185
Rather, I think
his plan was

26:34.220 --> 26:36.882
to splice this device onto it.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.988
You think you can figure out
what it does?

26:40.030 --> 26:42.191
I won't know for sure till_
we cut off the melted plastic,

26:42.230 --> 26:45.097
but hopefully, enough of the
circuitry inside is intact.

26:45.130 --> 26:46.825
IfI was a betting man,

26:46.870 --> 26:48.667
I'd say that it was meant
to collect information

26:48.700 --> 26:50.065
and transmit it elsewhere.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.261
You're thinking this is
one big data grab.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.868
GREGSON:
Why not hack into it

26:53.910 --> 26:55.730
from a computer somewhere?

26:55.780 --> 26:57.077
There's gotta be an easier way
than digging that tunnel.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.805
Ask the NSA.

26:58.850 --> 26:59.999
According to Edward Snowden,

27:00.050 --> 27:01.210
US. intelligence agencies

27:01.250 --> 27:02.842
routinely tap into these cables

27:02.880 --> 27:04.245
upstream of their
official tie-ins

27:04.290 --> 27:06.087
so they can better monitor
American citizens.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.883
The first time Ruby
feeds aboveground

27:07.920 --> 27:09.683
is at 60 Hudson,
downtown.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.086
Big banks have a offices there
to get financial data first,

27:12.130 --> 27:13.893
but_it's also where a lot
of info gets encrypted

27:13.930 --> 27:15.090
and after that,

27:15.130 --> 27:17.098
it's harder to spy on.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.791
Actually, digging a hole
on Long Island

27:18.830 --> 27:20.422
makes a lot of sense.
GREGSON:
So you're saying

27:20.470 --> 27:22.165
So you're saying my phone
might ring at any minute,

27:22.200 --> 27:24.236
telling me this guy
works for our government?

27:24.270 --> 27:26.659
Perhaps. Or a foreign one.
Or a corporation.

27:26.710 --> 27:28.029
I mean, who in this day and age

27:28.080 --> 27:29.229
does not view information
as power?

27:29.280 --> 27:30.975
TECH:
Hopefully, the device

27:31.010 --> 27:32.898
will tell us what information
the perp was capturing:

27:32.950 --> 27:34.975
e-mails, trade secrets,
credit card numbers...

27:35.020 --> 27:36.942
If we're lucky,
we'll even get an IP address

27:36.980 --> 27:38.311
where it was being sent.

27:38.350 --> 27:40.386
Then we'll have
a better idea of what

27:40.420 --> 27:42.058
we're dealing with.

27:42.090 --> 27:45.184
Nadim Al-Haj, born
in Iraq in 1978.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.448
He emigrated to the US. in '06

27:47.490 --> 27:49.993
and became a citizen
two years ago.

27:50.030 --> 27:52.464
He was an electrical engineer
in his country,

27:52.500 --> 27:54.934
but he's been working here as
a lineman for the cable company.

27:54.970 --> 27:56.699
So he definitely
had the skills.

27:56.740 --> 27:58.469
Yeah, a few
parking summonses,

27:58.510 --> 28:01.809
but no criminal record
that I could find.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.740
What's that about?

28:03.780 --> 28:05.247
BELL:
Oh, you didn't hear?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.975
Hannah made
a big collar

28:07.010 --> 28:08.477
on her patrol this morning.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.010
Everyone's been messing
with the captain over it.

28:10.050 --> 28:11.984
Hmm. What'd she do?

28:12.020 --> 28:13.385
She spotted a perp
who matched the description

28:13.420 --> 28:15.308
off a few drugstore robberies
on her beat.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.282
Now, he took off
into a warehouse,

28:17.320 --> 28:19.481
she and her partner followed,
scooped him up

28:19.530 --> 28:22.897
and found almost
200 grand worth of pills.

28:22.930 --> 28:24.397
That's pretty luclq.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.489
Well, that ain't luck.
That's DNA.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.067
She's good.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.102
I-- you know,
I just realized I forgot--

28:31.140 --> 28:32.767
I have to run an errand.

28:32.810 --> 28:34.129
I'll... just tell Sherlock
I'll catch up.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.374
All right.

28:39.280 --> 28:40.747
Captain...

28:40.780 --> 28:42.839
this is all we could find
on Nadim Al-Haj.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.438
It isn't much.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.879
Finest message is out
on him and his van,

28:46.920 --> 28:48.888
and Homeland Security's
issued a BOLO

28:48.920 --> 28:51.127
to Port Authority,
Amtrak and TSA.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.185
The apartment
Mr. Al-Haj occupied

28:53.230 --> 28:54.993
is owned by
"The Collin Eisely Group"?

28:56.030 --> 28:58.123
You know that name?
I do.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.388
Watson and I paid a visit
to Collin Eisely yesterday.

29:00.430 --> 29:02.034
He's a developer.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.867
Several months ago,
he made a bid on the house

29:03.910 --> 29:05.537
next to the one with the tunnel.

29:05.570 --> 29:09.779
You mean the one that's actually
much closer to the cable?

29:09.810 --> 29:12.108
HOLMES:
The man who murdered
Garrison Boyd

29:12.150 --> 29:13.913
lives in a building
that you own.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.144
What do you suppose

29:15.180 --> 29:18.047
the odds are of that
being a coincidence?

29:18.090 --> 29:19.409
I own several buildings,

29:19.450 --> 29:21.782
which, together,
house hundreds of tenants.

29:21.820 --> 29:23.412
It may surprise you to know

29:23.460 --> 29:25.189
that I'm not on a first-name
ba5is With any of them.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.788
It's interesting that
you should mention names,

29:26.830 --> 29:28.252
because you changed yours,
did you not?

29:28.300 --> 29:30.552
BELL:
Before you got
into real estate,

29:30.600 --> 29:33.194
you were a stockbroker,
and until a few years ago,

29:33.230 --> 29:34.868
your legal name
was Louis Eisely.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.891
Collin was your middle name.

29:36.940 --> 29:39.033
Now, we're guessing the
decision to change it

29:39.070 --> 29:40.298
has something
to do with you

29:40.340 --> 29:41.534
serving 18 months
for insider trading?

29:41.580 --> 29:44.048
The name change was aboveboard;

29:44.080 --> 29:46.571
I'm not breaking any laws.

29:46.610 --> 29:48.919
My real estate dealings
go much more smoothly

29:48.950 --> 29:50.417
when my criminal record

29:50.450 --> 29:51.940
isn't the first thing
people learn about me.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.810
I imagine they would.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.556
Because Louis Eisely
was a particularly cutthroat

29:56.590 --> 29:58.182
Wall Street trader.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.050
From the early 20005.

30:00.090 --> 30:02.229
A man whose downfall,
at the height of his career,

30:02.260 --> 30:05.468
made his name synonymous
with Wall Street greed.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.598
I did my time.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.232
Prison changed me.

30:10.270 --> 30:12.602
I'm not so sure
that it did.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.074
Trading in secrets
put you on top.

30:15.110 --> 30:17.943
Does a man like you ever
really lose a taste for that?

30:17.980 --> 30:22.314
You still haven't explained
what it is you think I did.

30:22.350 --> 30:23.942
BELL:
You hired Nadim Al-Haj

30:23.990 --> 30:27.084
to tap a transatlantic
data cable called Ruby.

30:27.120 --> 30:29.384
Runs right past
Claire Renziger's basement.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.957
So, first, you tried
to buy her house.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.184
When she turned you down,

30:33.230 --> 30:35.050
you had Al-Haj dig a tunnel

30:35.100 --> 30:36.249
from next door, instead.

30:37.560 --> 30:40.120
And why would I have done
any of that?

30:40.170 --> 30:41.364
Because you have
a savant's talent

30:41.400 --> 30:42.958
for turning information
into gold.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.638
Ruby is the mother lode.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.638
Tapping into her would give you
unfettered access

30:46.670 --> 30:48.331
to a wealth of intelligence

30:48.380 --> 30:50.234
with which to inform_
your investment strategies.

30:50.280 --> 30:51.941
That's actually brilliant.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.277
I wish I had thought of it

30:53.310 --> 30:54.641
back when I was trading.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.614
I can't go near the market.

30:56.650 --> 31:00.245
The FCC has banned me from
trading until the day I die.

31:00.290 --> 31:02.986
By court order,
every dollar I have in stocks

31:03.020 --> 31:05.056
is in a blind trust.
You can look it up.

31:05.090 --> 31:07.354
Well, perhaps you're selling
the information for a price.

31:07.390 --> 31:09.221
And keep the proceeds where?

31:09.260 --> 31:10.420
In my mattress?

31:10.460 --> 31:12.496
The Feds audit all my accounts.

31:12.530 --> 31:14.634
I can't win at bingo
without them taking notice.

31:16.370 --> 31:18.361
Gentlemen,

31:18.410 --> 31:21.038
I have more important things
to do with my day.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.433
You're fishing;

31:22.480 --> 31:25.005
I'm not biting.

31:27.410 --> 31:30.072
Hannah.

31:30.120 --> 31:32.247
I just heard
the news.

31:32.290 --> 31:33.689
Congratulations.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.483
Thanks.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.056
So, I thought it was interesting

31:37.090 --> 31:39.183
how you just happened
to spot the suspect,

31:39.230 --> 31:40.629
took a whole stash house down.

31:40.660 --> 31:42.093
You said to leave
you out of it.

31:42.130 --> 31:43.654
This is not about
credit, Hannah.

31:43.700 --> 31:45.122
This is about
doing the right thing.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.627
The right thing would've
been to kick it upstairs.

31:47.670 --> 31:49.467
Let Hanford take it from there.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.604
Right. Go after bigger fish.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.607
So, why didn't you?

31:52.640 --> 31:54.005
You and I both know

31:54.040 --> 31:55.507
if I turned this
over to Hanford,

31:55.540 --> 31:57.098
I would've ended up a
footnote in his report.

31:57.140 --> 31:59.142
If it did lead to bigger
fish, not even that.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.512
But you don't know that.
I do. 'Cause I'm a cop.

32:01.550 --> 32:03.108
I've seen it.
I know how it works.

32:04.620 --> 32:06.110
And I'm not a cop, right?

32:06.150 --> 32:07.549
It's just different for me.

32:07.590 --> 32:08.716
Sergeant's exam is coming up.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.557
I get extra points
for commendations.

32:10.590 --> 32:12.683
I thought you were doing this
to help the people on your beat.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.528
Or is that just something
you thought I wanted to hear?

32:15.560 --> 32:17.050
I did help them.

32:17.100 --> 32:18.727
I got some bad guys
off the street.

32:18.770 --> 32:20.522
Just not as many
as you could have.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.266
You helped me
when I needed help.

32:23.300 --> 32:25.939
I won't forget it.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.219
WAT_SON:
Hey, I just ran

32:35.250 --> 32:37.275
into Marcus downstairs.
He told me about Collin Eisley.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.617
Sounds like it didn't go well.

32:38.650 --> 32:40.481
I'm no_ less convinced
of his connection

32:40.520 --> 32:42.215
to Garrison Boyd's murder.

32:42.260 --> 32:43.716
You know,
because of his history,

32:43.760 --> 32:46.354
Mr. Eisley's money
is in a blind trust.

32:46.390 --> 32:48.324
Well, that means
he can't touch it, right?

32:48.360 --> 32:51.568
More than that-- he can't
even know how it's managed.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.694
Now, Eisley's trust is handled
by Robiskie Investments,

32:54.740 --> 32:57.334
a second-tier
brokerage house at best.

32:57.370 --> 32:59.509
I suspect more prominent firms
refused his business

32:59.540 --> 33:02.373
because of the miasma
that still surrounds him.

33:02.410 --> 33:05.641
_ His investments are all
in computer-traded funds,

33:05.680 --> 33:09.514
which deliver a return far less
than the profits he once made.

33:09.550 --> 33:11.017
That's got to burn.

33:11.050 --> 33:12.244
Indeed.

33:12.290 --> 33:13.643
A man who had spent
his entire life

33:13.690 --> 33:15.510
exploiting weaknesses
in the financial system

33:15.560 --> 33:18.256
would surely chafe
at such restrictions.

33:18.290 --> 33:19.655
So, you thought he
wanted to tap into Ruby

33:19.690 --> 33:21.248
in order to profit
off the information,

33:21.300 --> 33:23.188
but there's no way he
can profit from it.

33:23.230 --> 33:25.323
Or that I've found thus far.
But I'm confident that when TARU

33:25.370 --> 33:27.691
deliver its report,
that mystery box is

33:27.730 --> 33:30.164
gonna connect Eisley
to the crime.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.667
In the meantime...

33:31.710 --> 33:35.271
I found this.

33:35.310 --> 33:37.278
A decade ago,
when Western companies

33:37.310 --> 33:40.473
were pillaging Iraq's resources
in the name of reconstruction,

33:40.510 --> 33:43.149
Eisley toured the oil fields

33:43.180 --> 33:44.408
near Kirkuk.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.042
That's Nadim Al-Haj.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.443
Al-Haj was his driver.

33:47.490 --> 33:48.559
He subsequently sponsored

33:48.590 --> 33:51.320
his immigration into the US.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.225
Now, "lived in his building"
could be written off to chance.

33:53.260 --> 33:55.353
This cannot.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.289
Hey, a senior technician
from TARU is on his way up.

33:58.330 --> 34:00.662
Says he's got some news.

34:03.100 --> 34:04.704
Parts of it were
pretty badly fused,

34:04.740 --> 34:06.708
but we were able
to foren5ically reconstruct

34:06.740 --> 34:09.106
most of the circuitry.
And?

34:09.140 --> 34:10.732
It doesn't look
like it was meant

34:10.780 --> 34:13.078
to transmit anything aanhere.

34:13.110 --> 34:15.146
So, what was it supposed to do?

34:15.180 --> 34:16.545
Well, that's the thing.
It doesn't store anything.

34:16.580 --> 34:17.774
It doesn't re-route anything.

34:17.820 --> 34:19.139
It doesn't change anything.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.556
It's just a maze of circuits.

34:21.590 --> 34:23.751
Data goes in one end
and comes out the other.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.224
That's it.

34:26.260 --> 34:28.125
So, someone went to all
the trouble of digging a tunnel,

34:28.160 --> 34:30.128
exposing a transatlantic
Internet cable

34:30.160 --> 34:32.822
and murdering a guy all so they
could attach a devise that...

34:32.870 --> 34:35.088
Does absolutely nothing.

34:46.580 --> 34:48.844
WATSON: I just got off
the phone with Marcus.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.610
So far, Nadim Al-Haj has done a
pretty good job of disappearing.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.208
He's gone to ground.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.387
Knowing now he's
not a hardened terrorist,

34:54.420 --> 34:55.512
I imagine he's quite afraid.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.255
A murder and a flight
from the law

34:57.290 --> 34:58.723
were not part of his plan.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.557
Mason?

35:00.590 --> 35:02.126
Hey.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.196
I thought you were grounded.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.527
From the Internet.

35:05.570 --> 35:08.164
I mean, does this look
like the Internet to you?

35:08.200 --> 35:10.839
So, where New York's
finest nerds failed,

35:10.870 --> 35:13.168
you're hoping
yours will succeed?

35:14.440 --> 35:15.668
But the simple fact is

35:15.710 --> 35:16.836
they must've missed something.

35:16.880 --> 35:18.609
Nadim Al-Haj did not dig

35:18.650 --> 35:21.175
a 50-foot tunnel_ in order
to install a plastic bauble

35:21.220 --> 35:23.438
with as much function
as a Christmas light.

35:23.480 --> 35:25.448
Until we find out
what the devise does,

35:25.490 --> 35:27.549
we cannot connect
Collin Eisley to any crime.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.854
So, I've solicited
a second opinion.

35:29.890 --> 35:32.484
It's my hope that Mason
will find something

35:32.530 --> 35:33.724
that the police
technicians missed.

35:33.760 --> 35:34.897
I'm trying.

35:34.930 --> 35:36.625
But don't hold you breath.

35:36.660 --> 35:37.854
I'm running parity bit tests,

35:37.900 --> 35:39.720
file compares,
metadata compares,

35:39.770 --> 35:41.635
different character sets,
packet sizes...

35:41.670 --> 35:44.207
You're running tests.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.867
We get it.
(cell phone ringing)

35:45.910 --> 35:48.378
(sighs)

35:48.410 --> 35:51.641
I'm gonna get
something to eat.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.912
Upstairs, may I presume
that was Hannah

35:58.950 --> 36:00.713
that you sent to voicemail?

36:00.750 --> 36:02.752
Yeah, I didn't think she
was gonna leave a message,

36:02.790 --> 36:04.621
but she did.

36:04.660 --> 36:06.719
She said she didn't feel great
about how we left things,

36:06.760 --> 36:08.421
and wanted to thank me again.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.189
I mean, she didn't really
come out and say it,

36:10.230 --> 36:12.721
but I got the sense that what
she really wanted to know is

36:12.770 --> 36:14.635
what I'm gonna tell the captain.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.297
What are you gonna tell him?

36:16.340 --> 36:19.264
I don't know. I mean...

36:19.310 --> 36:21.801
he's gonna want to know
what happened, right?

36:21.840 --> 36:25.503
She's a police officer,
but she's also his daughter.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.700
Obviously the truth
will disappoint.

36:27.750 --> 36:29.968
(sighs)

36:30.020 --> 36:32.614
I should tell him.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.857
You should not.

36:34.890 --> 36:36.858
You've expended enough time
and effort on Hannah Gregson.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.653
Telling him will
only embroil you further

36:38.690 --> 36:40.419
and benefit no one.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.497
Well, thanks for not
actually saying the words

36:44.530 --> 36:46.566
"I told you so."

36:46.600 --> 36:48.534
Well, for the record, I thought
she was a subpar investigator.

36:48.570 --> 36:51.334
I'd no idea she was so cunning.

36:51.370 --> 36:54.498
Anyway, I sent Mason
home for the night.

36:54.540 --> 36:57.737
Thus far, his tests uphold
the dignity of the NYPD.

36:57.780 --> 37:01.318
The stream of zeroe_s and ones
generated by his tests

37:01.350 --> 37:03.614
entered one end of the device

37:03.650 --> 37:05.880
and emerged a consistent formula
seconds later,

37:05.920 --> 37:07.911
unchanged.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.554
It is quite literally

37:09.590 --> 37:11.956
a box that does nothing.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.821
Unless that's the whole point.

37:18.870 --> 37:19.825
What?

37:19.870 --> 37:20.825
The four milliseconds

37:20.870 --> 37:23.395
that doing nothing would take.

37:30.310 --> 37:31.846
What difference would four
milliseconds make to anything?

37:31.880 --> 37:34.314
In your world and
mine, none at all.

37:34.350 --> 37:36.568
To a human being, it's a
imperceptible amount of time.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.645
But the lion's share of
trading on Wall Street

37:38.690 --> 37:40.817
happens automatically,
via computers.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.556
And in their world,

37:42.590 --> 37:43.852
milliseconds translate

37:43.890 --> 37:46.586
to millions of dollars.

37:46.630 --> 37:48.552
Ruby is the fastest
transatlantic cable

37:48.600 --> 37:49.999
that there is.

37:50.030 --> 37:52.726
Terminates on American
soil at 60 Hudson Street,

37:52.770 --> 37:55.568
where, in order to extract
financial data first,

37:55.600 --> 37:59.001
the top investment firms pay a
premium to house their servers.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.735
Now, any company which
does not lease a space

38:00.770 --> 38:03.568
at 60 Hudson is at
instant disadvantage.

38:03.610 --> 38:07.398
Would you care to guess
which firm is not flush

38:07.450 --> 38:10.669
with enough capital to
earn a spot at 60 Hudson?

38:12.920 --> 38:15.650
WATSON:
Robiskie Investments.

38:15.690 --> 38:17.419
They manage your blind trust.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.758
Only their servers are
in a different building.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.623
Their data comes in from a
slower transatlantic cable.

38:22.660 --> 38:25.026
One that is usually
two milliseconds behind.

38:25.070 --> 38:27.061
A market closes
halfway around the world,

38:27.100 --> 38:28.795
currency drops,
a regime falls--

38:28.840 --> 38:31.764
the news hurdles across
the globe at the speed of light.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.960
The larger firms'
computers buy and sell

38:34.010 --> 38:36.376
thousands of shares before
the one that holds your money

38:36.410 --> 38:37.900
even gets the news.

38:37.940 --> 38:39.840
BELL: So you planned
to turn the tables.

38:39.880 --> 38:42.519
Slow Ruby down
by four milliseconds.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.984
Suddenly the big firms are
the ones at a disadvantage.

38:45.020 --> 38:47.682
Your bli_nd trust would
start making more money.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.051
And your hands would stay clean.

38:49.090 --> 38:51.058
WATSON:
Other firms and clients

38:51.090 --> 38:53.058
would benefit, too--
anyone who pulled their data

38:53.090 --> 38:54.990
from a source other than Ruby.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.998
But for a man pathologically
driven to play the game,

38:57.030 --> 38:58.998
that's a small price to pay.

38:59.030 --> 39:01.464
Might even be a plus.

39:01.500 --> 39:04.333
Given that it would hide
your gains amongst the crowd.

39:05.640 --> 39:08.404
You give me a lot of credit.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.533
Like I said before--
it's a brilliant plan.

39:10.580 --> 39:12.741
But... even if you're right,

39:12.780 --> 39:14.748
you still have a problem.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.419
You can't link me to any of it.

39:17.450 --> 39:19.816
Well, when my colleagues and I

39:19.850 --> 39:22.557
got together this morning,
I said the same thing.

39:22.590 --> 39:25.457
I also asked about something
that's been bugging me.

39:25.490 --> 39:27.549
When you first
hired Nadim Al-Haj,

39:27.590 --> 39:29.751
the job didn't include murder.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.928
Once he killed Garrison Boyd,
you must've promised him

39:32.970 --> 39:34.164
a pretty big payday
to keep him quiet.

39:34.200 --> 39:36.862
Especially with him going on
the run for who knows how long.

39:36.900 --> 39:39.767
But with your finances
watched so closely,

39:39.810 --> 39:41.630
how could you pay him?

39:41.680 --> 39:44.501
When I crossed paths
with Mr. Al-Haj the other day,

39:44.550 --> 39:45.903
he absconded
with a poster tube--

39:45.950 --> 39:47.440
a conspicuous detail in itself,

39:47.480 --> 39:49.038
given that he was so busy

39:49.080 --> 39:51.446
destroying so much
other evidence.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.685
I thought perhaps
he'd retained a keepsake--

39:53.720 --> 39:54.914
some schematics,

39:54.960 --> 39:56.450
some leverage to hold over you

39:56.490 --> 39:57.787
should the need arise.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.651
But when Detective Bell
raised his question,

39:59.690 --> 40:02.693
I remembered noticing something
when we were here yesterday.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.158
That's not the same painting
that was here

40:06.200 --> 40:08.566
the first time we visited.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.828
It was a Picasso.

40:09.870 --> 40:11.428
Woman's Portrait.

40:11.470 --> 40:12.607
Not well-known, but

40:12.640 --> 40:14.835
even a lesser work
by the master

40:14.880 --> 40:17.201
must be worth millions.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.969
Is it here?

40:19.010 --> 40:20.898
WATSON: We've already
reported it stolen.

40:20.950 --> 40:22.474
No dealer is gonna touch it.

40:22.520 --> 40:26.047
Al-Haj won't be able
to get a dime.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.651
You tell us if we're wrong,
Mr. Eisley.

40:29.690 --> 40:32.079
But we don't get the sense
he's a professional killer.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.155
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

40:34.190 --> 40:36.021
And given that
his payday's going away,

40:36.060 --> 40:39.188
it's a good bet that when we do,
he'll talk.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.797
Now, you like to
make deals, right?

40:42.840 --> 40:44.865
How about
before we find him,

40:44.910 --> 40:47.003
you make one right now?

40:50.880 --> 40:54.099
GREGSON:
Oh, Joan?

40:54.150 --> 40:55.139
Hi.

40:55.180 --> 40:56.772
Nice work today.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.617
On the Eisley thing.

40:58.650 --> 40:59.787
Oh, thanks.
Hmm.

40:59.820 --> 41:01.185
I'll pass that on to Sherlock.

41:01.220 --> 41:03.916
I'm sorry.

41:05.530 --> 41:06.929
For what?

41:15.040 --> 41:16.894
She told you?

41:16.940 --> 41:19.636
You just seemed a little off
these last couple of days.

41:19.670 --> 41:22.503
I know it wasn't the credit.

41:22.540 --> 41:26.203
You and Holmes don't
care about that stuff, but...

41:26.250 --> 41:28.741
whatever it was...

41:28.780 --> 41:29.872
You know what?
She just got excited.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.148
That's all.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.240
I don't think
you should help her again.

41:35.860 --> 41:38.078
She is what she is.

41:38.120 --> 41:40.520
She wants what she wants.

41:40.560 --> 41:42.551
I love her...

41:42.600 --> 41:44.568
but I love this job, too.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.090
The people who do it.

41:48.970 --> 41:51.803
She's got to do better.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.201
All right, good night.
