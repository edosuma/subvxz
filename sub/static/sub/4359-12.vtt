<i> My sister Annie

<i> I can't let anyone else know.</i>

some experiment.</i>

00:53.360 --> 00:55.000
<i> But you know something?</i>

01:03.920 --> 01:06.120
the assistant manager
at Doodler's doughnuts--

01:06.120 --> 01:08.440
the one at the mall,
not the one downtown--

01:08.440 --> 01:09.400
and he said...

01:09.400 --> 01:10.560
Mrs. Mack:
Here we go!

01:10.560 --> 01:13.040
Annie, your favorite:
Vegetarian lasagna!

01:13.040 --> 01:15.640
Here, honey, let me
give you some of this.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.600
Thanks.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.720
Sweetheart,
want some?

01:17.720 --> 01:18.720
Uhh... in a minute.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.800
Okay, here.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.000
Mm-- ah!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.440
So, what's the big announcement?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.480
Alex: Well, no big
announcement, really.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.480
He said we could have
mini-doughnuts whenever...

01:27.480 --> 01:28.320
Alex.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.480
Just a minute,
honey.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.840
As you know,
I took that

01:30.840 --> 01:33.480
advanced placement English test
just to see...

01:33.480 --> 01:36.080
and... I scored a five.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.360
<i>( Both gasp )</i>

01:37.360 --> 01:38.600
Yeah, first time it's

01:38.600 --> 01:40.480
been done by
a high school student.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.720
Mr. Mack:
Unbelievable!

01:41.720 --> 01:43.200
Which means
I can take that

01:43.200 --> 01:45.640
two-week intensive
at the university with...

01:45.640 --> 01:46.920
Professor Ivan McKee.

01:46.920 --> 01:49.160
Oh, sweetheart,
that's great!

01:49.160 --> 01:50.960
You are really
branching out

01:50.960 --> 01:51.920
from science.

01:51.920 --> 01:53.600
We are so proud of you.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.360
Mr. Mack:
Ivan McKee, he wrote, uh

01:55.360 --> 01:58.080
<i> no congas, no
clarinets, didn't he?</i>

01:58.080 --> 01:59.320
<i>( Parents gasp )</i>

01:59.320 --> 02:00.440
Oh! Ugh!

02:00.440 --> 02:01.080
Alex.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.200
Alex!
Alex!

02:02.200 --> 02:03.160
Sorry.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.160
I'll clean it up.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.880
<i>( Sighs )</i>

02:07.880 --> 02:10.960
Anyway, it's going to be
really challenging.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.560
And I'm kind of scared.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.600
Mrs. Mack: Sweetheart,
you're used to challenges.

02:15.600 --> 02:17.080
I just think it's great

02:17.080 --> 02:18.800
you're out conquering
a new field.

02:18.800 --> 02:19.760
Hey,
Mom...

02:19.760 --> 02:21.640
how about some of that lasagna?

02:21.640 --> 02:23.160
Um... in a second,
sweetie.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.560
I want to make a toast.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.280
To Annie...
who just keeps on

02:26.280 --> 02:27.680
surprising us!

02:28.640 --> 02:29.480
<i>( Laughs )</i>

02:30.440 --> 02:31.680
Mr. Mack:
To Annie.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
<i>( Clink )</i>

02:34.120 --> 02:35.080
Wow!

02:37.320 --> 02:39.200
Math club president?

02:39.200 --> 02:40.360
Whew.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.040
"Little ladies of language"?

02:45.960 --> 02:48.520
"The hypotenuse society."

02:49.480 --> 02:50.640
Yeah.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.560
Annie's belonged to
every club ever invented.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.680
"Camp wahooie sack race,
honorable mention"?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.280
Wow, she's done it all.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.880
That's mine, Ray.

03:00.880 --> 03:01.800
Oh...

03:01.800 --> 03:03.400
It's my only one.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.320
Honorable mention...

03:05.320 --> 03:07.240
That's nice.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.840
Now, come on.

03:08.840 --> 03:11.080
I need you to come up
with some stuff

03:11.080 --> 03:12.240
for me to do, too.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.800
Hey, what about
stamp club?

03:13.800 --> 03:15.360
Do you really
like stamps?

03:15.360 --> 03:17.080
I don't care at this point.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.160
I just want to achieve
something greater in my life

03:20.160 --> 03:21.840
than getting
free doughnuts.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.680
I want to try everything,
then narrow it down.

03:24.680 --> 03:25.640
Okay.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.960
You got the math club.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.520
You got ski club, yearbook

03:28.520 --> 03:30.000
and also
school newspaper.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.040
Not to mention
the dance committee.

03:32.040 --> 03:33.960
Okay, this is good.
Keep going.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.560
Okay, you got
big sisters.

03:35.560 --> 03:37.600
And you also have
the glee club--

03:37.600 --> 03:39.120
I don't know
what they do

03:39.120 --> 03:41.320
but sounds like
they're having fun.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.360
Computer club...

03:42.360 --> 03:43.920
And, of course,
4-H club.

03:43.920 --> 03:45.520
4-H? What's that?

03:45.520 --> 03:48.600
Well, it stands for
"head, heart, hands and health."

03:48.600 --> 03:50.200
Basically, future farmers.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.720
Future farmers?

03:51.720 --> 03:52.960
Forget it.

03:52.960 --> 03:54.880
Alex, I don't know about this.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.440
So what, your sister
has all these trophies?

03:57.440 --> 03:59.200
You can't catch up in one week.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.480
I just want
to show her

04:00.480 --> 04:02.360
I can be good at something, too.

04:02.360 --> 04:05.560
From here on, you'll see
a new, improved Alex Mack.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.680
<i>Man:
I think of most writing as...</i>

04:09.680 --> 04:11.560
soil.

04:11.560 --> 04:13.480
And from the soil

04:13.480 --> 04:15.400
with a little nurturing

04:15.400 --> 04:19.000
perhaps a... garden can grow.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.079
I'll insist
that you write

04:22.079 --> 04:23.880
every day.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.800
And your first assignment

04:25.800 --> 04:29.960
due tomorrow, will be
autobiographical in nature.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.800
I want you to tell me
about yourself.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.040
What makes you... tick

04:35.040 --> 04:37.520
and feel and think.

04:37.520 --> 04:40.320
I want blood, I want guts

04:40.320 --> 04:42.280
I want mucous.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.080
I want mucous...

04:45.080 --> 04:47.280
And I want it by Thursday.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.440
Excuse me.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.560
You're Annie Mack...
right?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.320
Yes, I am.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.760
Miss Mack,
feel free

04:57.760 --> 04:59.480
to bring
a tape recorder

04:59.480 --> 05:01.640
to record my
lectures, but...

05:01.640 --> 05:03.880
this class is
about creativity.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.960
There's no need
to take down

05:05.960 --> 05:07.360
every single word.

05:07.360 --> 05:08.840
Oh. Sorry.

05:17.640 --> 05:18.880
Oh, right.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.200
I can't do that.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.040
<i>( No audio )</i>

05:50.840 --> 05:51.880
<i>( Sighs )</i>

05:51.880 --> 05:53.000
Somehow...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.760
she got herself
onto the yearbook staff

05:55.760 --> 05:58.880
the spring dance committee,
and the 4-H club.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.280
I swear, if there was
a parachute club

06:01.280 --> 06:03.560
she'd probably sign up
for that, too.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.000
Should we be worried?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.080
This doesn't sound
like our Alex.

06:07.080 --> 06:08.040
<i>( Sighs )</i>

06:08.040 --> 06:09.640
Oh, George,
don't you see?

06:09.640 --> 06:12.440
She just wants to be noticed
for something...

06:12.440 --> 06:13.480
Anything.

06:14.680 --> 06:17.680
She really needs
our encouragement right now.

06:20.240 --> 06:21.800
Did I fall asleep?

06:21.800 --> 06:23.080
Mm-hmm.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.640
Want to know
what I've been doing?

06:25.640 --> 06:27.880
Seizing the day.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.640
Why don't you go up
to bed now, sweetheart?

06:30.640 --> 06:32.680
And we can talk
in the morning.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.000
Okay.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.080
<i>Ray: Mrs. Mack, I
think Alex could use</i>

06:42.080 --> 06:44.360
a little orange juice
this morning.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.920
Ray, what are you
doing here so early?

06:46.920 --> 06:50.480
Your sister is redefining
the word "extracurricular"

06:50.480 --> 06:52.440
and Ray...
He's coaching her.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.520
Managing her.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.120
Alex: Good
morning, everybody.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.200
Okay, Ray,
what are we doing today?

06:57.200 --> 07:00.120
Before school, meeting
with the sweet adelines.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.120
Right. We tutor
seventh graders?

07:02.120 --> 07:05.080
No! The sweet adelines
is the square dancing.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.840
The tutoring is
the big sisters of smarts.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.760
You meet with them at lunch.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.240
And, after school, 4-H.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.680
4-H, Annie.
We find husbands for pigs.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.680
I think you mean
"animal husbandry."

07:15.680 --> 07:16.960
Whatever.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.000
Are you really passionate
about all this?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.680
How can I be passionate about it
if I haven't even started yet?

07:22.680 --> 07:25.320
You're not the only one
who tries new things.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.680
Come on, Ray, let's go!

07:26.680 --> 07:27.720
<i> Ciao.</i>

07:29.560 --> 07:32.120
You know why she's doing
this, don't you?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.080
Mm?

07:33.080 --> 07:35.080
She wants to be more like you.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.840
Ray:
That's pretty good.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.160
What say we go to
the mall for doughnuts?

07:58.160 --> 07:59.680
What are you
talking about?

07:59.680 --> 08:02.640
Maybe I'm not cut out
for a life of achievement.

08:02.640 --> 08:04.440
I'm rotten at
everything I do.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.440
Besides, I'm passionate
about the mall.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.520
I'm very good at it.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.880
You're quitting on me?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.360
Today I hit
Stephen

08:10.360 --> 08:11.840
with a bowling pin.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.480
Sorry, Stephen.

08:13.480 --> 08:14.800
You might want

08:14.800 --> 08:16.320
to put some ice on that.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.280
Alex, I thought

08:17.280 --> 08:18.960
you were serious
when you said

08:18.960 --> 08:21.040
you wanted to
seize the day.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.120
Annie was right.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.120
No, you're not
getting off that easy.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.320
Now, you're a winner.

08:25.320 --> 08:26.280
I don't care

08:26.280 --> 08:27.520
if you prove it
to Annie

08:27.520 --> 08:28.640
your parents, anyone.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.760
I want you to prove it
to yourself.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.720
Let's go to 4-H.

08:31.720 --> 08:32.679
Ray, I told you.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.280
I know nothing about animals.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.840
So? Let's give it a shot.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.000
If it doesn't work

08:37.000 --> 08:38.559
<i> then we'll
get doughnuts.</i>

08:39.520 --> 08:40.480
Come on.

08:44.120 --> 08:46.880
"My love of math has opened up
the world to me.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.800
"Numbers are not
black and white

08:48.800 --> 08:51.720
"they are gray, filled
with ambiguity and wonder.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.400
"It has taught me
that the world is not finite

08:55.400 --> 08:56.560
"but infinite.

mathematics explains..."

<i>( Moos )</i>

09:00.760 --> 09:03.640
Welcome to 4-H,
ladies and gentlemen!

09:03.640 --> 09:04.680
My name is John

09:04.680 --> 09:06.280
and I will be
your guide

09:06.280 --> 09:08.080
to the glories
of farming.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.840
Today's subject
is dairy.

09:11.040 --> 09:12.400
Whether it be butter

09:12.400 --> 09:13.600
whether it be milk

09:13.600 --> 09:16.240
whether it be the proverbial
chicken egg

09:16.240 --> 09:21.280
dairy is a big part
of human life.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.520
My job today
is to convince you

09:23.520 --> 09:25.760
that there is a dairy farmer

09:25.760 --> 09:28.960
lurking inside
each and every one of you.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.680
Who's my first volunteer?

09:32.600 --> 09:33.760
How about, um...?

09:33.760 --> 09:35.480
Alex.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.920
Alex!

09:36.920 --> 09:38.360
Uh, no,
I don't think so.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.720
Come on, Alex,
don't be shy.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.160
It's not as hard
as it looks.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.320
Yeah, go
for it, Alex.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.760
Have you ever
milked a cow before?

09:49.760 --> 09:51.240
Not to my knowledge.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.200
No?

09:52.200 --> 09:53.360
Well, don't worry.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.920
All it takes
is practice.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.960
Watch me.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.280
<i>( Mooing in background )</i>

09:58.280 --> 09:59.240
Bucket.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.480
Thank you.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.680
Now...

10:01.680 --> 10:05.600
You just settle right
in here under blossom.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.080
<i>( Mooing )</i>

10:08.040 --> 10:09.720
I want you kids to remember

10:09.720 --> 10:11.880
next week,
I need to choose someone

10:11.880 --> 10:14.200
to represent
Danielle Atron Junior High

10:14.200 --> 10:15.760
in the dairy decathlon.

10:15.760 --> 10:17.000
All right, Alex...

10:18.280 --> 10:20.360
Show me what
you're made of.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.520
Not great, Kevin,
but a nice start.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.920
And now,
last but not least

10:38.920 --> 10:40.640
Annie Mack.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.600
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

10:44.040 --> 10:46.120
What was your paper
called, uh...

10:46.120 --> 10:47.880
"In search of excellence"?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.000
"Pursuit of excellence."

10:49.000 --> 10:49.960
Ah.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.640
Oh-- could you
wait one second?

10:51.640 --> 10:52.760
I want to get my...

10:52.760 --> 10:54.480
Of course.

10:54.480 --> 10:55.440
Okay.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.400
There we go.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.200
Quite honestly,
I had expected

11:01.200 --> 11:04.040
something a little
more insightful, Annie.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.000
I feel like
you gave me the...

11:06.000 --> 11:09.320
Encyclopedia version,
without a sense of passion.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.400
What do you feel
strongly about?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.880
Obviously, you're
a very bright girl.

11:13.880 --> 11:15.840
But the worst thing
you can do

11:15.840 --> 11:18.200
is to keep the listener
uninvolved.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.480
Will you stay after

11:19.480 --> 11:21.600
so we can talk
about it further?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.520
Okay.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.040
<i>( Clicks off tape recorder )</i>

11:28.080 --> 11:30.120
<i>( Squirting )</i>

11:31.120 --> 11:32.440
Alex Mack!

11:32.440 --> 11:36.000
From the glistening suburbs
of Paradise Valley came a girl

11:36.000 --> 11:37.400
with cat-like reflexes

11:37.400 --> 11:40.400
and the precision
of a Swiss watchmaker.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.960
Alex Mack,
cow milker extraordinaire.

11:42.960 --> 11:44.400
Is she that good?

11:44.400 --> 11:45.720
I've seen them come

11:45.720 --> 11:47.560
and I've seen
them go, Ray.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.200
Alex was meant to milk.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.280
Her dexterity?

11:50.280 --> 11:51.920
You can't teach that.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.080
Really?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.520
Alex...

11:54.520 --> 11:57.160
I want you to represent us
next Tuesday

11:57.160 --> 11:58.800
in the Dairy Decathlon.

11:58.800 --> 12:00.600
Girls' Freestyle Division.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.560
It's going to be
on cable TV.

12:02.560 --> 12:03.640
Can you do it?!

12:03.640 --> 12:04.600
Uh...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.160
I don't...

12:06.160 --> 12:07.600
I think I'm busy.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.560
<i>( Yells ):
Ahh!</i>

12:08.560 --> 12:09.520
Don't worry.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.680
She'll be there.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.200
What's the matter?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.400
What's the matter?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.760
I do one thing well
and it's cow milking.

12:16.760 --> 12:18.000
I feel like a dork.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.680
So what if
it's cow milking?

12:19.680 --> 12:21.600
You're going to be
on cable TV.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.960
Was Annie ever on TV?

12:22.960 --> 12:23.920
N-no, but...

12:23.920 --> 12:24.920
Heck no!

12:24.920 --> 12:27.000
I can hear her
drooling from here.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.480
Perhaps this wasn't
a good idea.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.240
We'll be moving
very quickly.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.000
So, I'll really
need to see

12:33.000 --> 12:35.760
some improvement
in your next effort or...

12:37.840 --> 12:40.720
Or I may have to drop you
from the class...

12:41.640 --> 12:43.560
In fairness to the others.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.560
<i>Alex:
So I guess Mom told you?</i>

12:59.560 --> 13:03.000
I'm competing in the
Dairy Decathlon today.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.720
Girls' Freestyle.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.080
I didn't even know
you were on the swim team.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.320
It's not the
swim team, Annie.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.920
The dairy decathlon--

13:11.920 --> 13:13.720
you know, the 4-H club?

13:13.720 --> 13:15.960
I'm very passionate
about it.

13:17.320 --> 13:19.000
<i>( Typing )</i>

13:19.000 --> 13:21.880
So... what are you
working on?

13:21.880 --> 13:25.520
Uh, it's a rewrite
of my English paper.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.400
Is there
anything else?

13:27.400 --> 13:28.640
No.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.960
Actually, I would
really like it

13:31.960 --> 13:34.520
if you would come to
the decathlon today

13:34.520 --> 13:35.840
and watch me compete.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.560
When is it?

13:37.560 --> 13:38.720
3:30.

13:38.720 --> 13:40.120
The field
behind school.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.160
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.280
You promise?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.360
Sure.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
<i>( Cattle mooing )</i>

13:51.640 --> 13:53.360
How do you feel?
Nervous?

13:54.920 --> 13:55.920
Wow.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.720
That is
a beautiful trophy.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.640
Annie never got
one that big.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.080
Where is she, anyway?

14:02.080 --> 14:03.880
Look, don't worry
about Annie.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.040
And keep your eyes
off the hardware.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.800
You got to stay
focused, okay?

14:07.800 --> 14:09.720
Now, remember,
you're a natural.

14:09.720 --> 14:10.880
Man:
Competitors

14:10.880 --> 14:13.040
may I have your
attention, please?

14:15.600 --> 14:18.640
Now, you are the best and
the brightest, dairywise.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.840
And it's time to show
paradise valley what you got.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.320
<i>McKee ( On tape ): Quite

14:25.320 --> 14:27.360
a little more insightful, Annie.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.440
I feel like you gave me
the encyclopedia version

14:30.440 --> 14:32.160
without a sense of passion.

14:32.160 --> 14:34.200
What do you feel strongly about?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.040
No, don't worry
about her.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.640
She's all flash.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.960
Annie promised.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.560
She said she'd be here.

15:00.560 --> 15:02.600
Maybe her class
ran late.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.880
She doesn't have class now.

The Dairy Decathlon, remember?

16:54.720 --> 16:56.440
It's my
English paper.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.000
I'm just caught up...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.120

a problem with it?

Oh, no! Not at all.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.480
It's just... my professor...

17:03.480 --> 17:05.119
McKee wanted
me to make

17:05.119 --> 17:06.960
some changes before tomorrow.

Can I speak
to Annie, please?

Alone?

17:10.720 --> 17:11.800
Sure.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.640
What, did I do
something wrong?

17:17.640 --> 17:18.760
Yes.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.400
I wanted you to come.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.000
Why are you making

17:22.000 --> 17:23.200
such a big deal
about this?

17:23.200 --> 17:25.640
It's just
some stupid cow milking.

17:25.640 --> 17:28.160
Yes, it's only cow milking.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.560
<i>And maybe
it is stupid.</i>

17:29.560 --> 17:30.800
But my whole life

17:30.800 --> 17:32.520
I've been watching you
win things

17:32.520 --> 17:33.840
be elected
to things.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.600
Just once

17:35.600 --> 17:38.080
I wanted you
to come watch me.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.440
And what's so important

17:39.440 --> 17:41.040
about one
more class?

17:41.040 --> 17:43.200
So what if you get
one more A-plus?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.960
You're nothing but
a big, fat selfish person!

17:45.960 --> 17:48.440
Alex, wait.

17:48.440 --> 17:50.240
You don't understand.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.280
I can't believe
she's not here.

She's the
worst sister

entire world.

Forget about her.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.800
Forget about her?

18:10.800 --> 18:13.240
Why do you think
I did this whole thing

Okay, Alex.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.000
Thanks for everything.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.720
Annie: So maybe I just
don't have the right amount

20:02.720 --> 20:04.440
of blood or guts I need.

20:04.440 --> 20:06.520
When you spend
your whole life

20:06.520 --> 20:09.440
receiving things,
you miss out on a lot.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.560
I look at my
little sister, and...

20:11.560 --> 20:14.320
Though I know she envies
my accomplishments

20:14.320 --> 20:17.240
she doesn't realize
how I envy her.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.040
To see the world
the way she does

20:20.040 --> 20:23.080
to have friends,
to be open-minded--

20:23.080 --> 20:25.960
those are the things
I wish I had.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.720
And I wish I knew
how to tell her.

20:38.560 --> 20:41.600
I was being as honest
as I possibly could.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.960
I appreciate that
you spoke honestly

20:43.960 --> 20:45.280
and from your heart.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.440
McKee: But... I'm
going to suggest to you

20:48.440 --> 20:50.920
that you're not quite
ready for this class.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.080
Annie:
I can learn.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.680
I'll try harder.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.240
McKee:
I'm sorry, Annie.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.520
There's no need

20:57.520 --> 20:59.320
to think of this
as a defeat.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.920
<i>( Sighs )</i>

21:00.920 --> 21:03.480
Good luck in the future.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.840
Thanks.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.000
<i>( Sighs )</i>

21:18.600 --> 21:19.560
Hi.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.600
Hi.

21:20.600 --> 21:22.240
What are you doing here?

21:22.240 --> 21:24.400
Um, I was looking for you.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.760
You didn't see any
of my class, did you?

21:26.760 --> 21:27.920
No.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.920
Wow, it looks like
you did really well

21:31.920 --> 21:33.720
at the Dairy Decathlon.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.320
Yeah, I guess.
Thanks.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.840
As far as milking goes,
I'm the best.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.280
In my age range.
Freestyle.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.280
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

21:42.280 --> 21:44.080
Oh, that's okay.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.600
No, it's not okay.

21:45.600 --> 21:47.800
I should have been there
and I wasn't.

21:47.800 --> 21:49.040
I'm sorry.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.080
Okay... thanks.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.680
I'm leaving my class.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.800
It didn't work out.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.000
Basically,
I'm not good enough.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.840
I bet you could be
if you wanted to be.

22:03.840 --> 22:06.600
I mean, you have
so much else going on

22:06.600 --> 22:08.480
you can conquer it later.

22:08.480 --> 22:10.440
Hey, you want
to go to the mall?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.480
It's Thursday,
and I can show you

22:12.480 --> 22:15.000
how Ray and I score
free mini-doughnuts.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.720
Come on,
it's really fun.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.200
Alex, there is nothing
I would rather do

22:20.200 --> 22:22.080
than go to
the mall with you.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.480
<i>( Giggling )</i>

22:28.480 --> 22:30.560
It's... it's huge,
I know.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.160
