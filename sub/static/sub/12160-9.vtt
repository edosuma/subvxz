WEBVTT

00:02.333 --> 00:04.535
Hey, Mike. You got any plans
tonight, huh?

00:04.569 --> 00:07.037
Oh, great man plans--
park myself in the den,

00:07.072 --> 00:08.872
- watch a little ESPN...
- Ah.

00:08.907 --> 00:10.841
And I got some leftover brisket
to make a sandwich out of.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.844
Oh, yeah.
Nothing beats family, huh?

00:13.878 --> 00:16.213
You know, when you ask a question

00:16.247 --> 00:17.381
just to make conversation,

00:17.415 --> 00:20.584
you don't listen
to the answer, do you?

00:20.618 --> 00:23.020
Yeah. Me, too.

00:23.054 --> 00:25.089
You're losing it, old man.

00:25.123 --> 00:26.857
Who are you calling old?

00:26.891 --> 00:28.092
Oh, that you heard.

00:28.126 --> 00:30.727
Mm. Yeah. Age is just
a state of mind, my friend.

00:30.762 --> 00:32.229
- Is it really?
- Mm-hmm.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.047
Hey, you know that civil war,
uh, shotgun you have?

00:34.082 --> 00:35.065
Uh-huh.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.517
Did you buy that new?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.737
Oh, yeah. The 1800s.
Yeah, that's--

00:40.772 --> 00:43.507
that's around the last time
you picked up a check.

00:43.541 --> 00:47.010
Boom! He got you, Mr. B.

00:47.045 --> 00:48.412
Hey, Kyle.
Is that a new haircut,

00:48.446 --> 00:51.682
or did big bird just crap
on your head?

00:51.716 --> 00:53.050
(Laughter) Huh?

00:53.084 --> 00:55.752
Boom! Another good one...
(Chuckles)

00:55.787 --> 00:58.755
Except now my feelings are hurt.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.058
Oh, toughen up, ginger.
Come on.

01:01.092 --> 01:03.127
You don't want Ed to like your hair.

01:03.161 --> 01:04.510
If he liked your hair,

01:04.546 --> 01:06.597
it would show that he didn't
have respect for you.

01:06.631 --> 01:07.965
Come on. Come on. Hit me.

01:07.999 --> 01:09.216
- Yeah. Come on. 
- Come on. Give me your best shot.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.517
- Come on. Come on.
- I don't even think I could.

01:10.552 --> 01:12.553
Oh, you can do it. Step up.
Put your back into it.

01:12.604 --> 01:13.804
Look, I'll help you out.
I'll start it off.

01:13.838 --> 01:14.972
Yeah.
Hey, Ed.

01:15.006 --> 01:15.973
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. (Chuckles)

01:16.007 --> 01:18.108
Is that a beard or...

01:18.143 --> 01:22.579
Okay. Uh... just some hair
on your face?

01:22.614 --> 01:24.565
Ka-boom! (Chuckles)

01:24.616 --> 01:25.716
(Sighs)

01:25.750 --> 01:31.121
I can't even look at him, Mike. I...

01:31.463 --> 01:34.763
Last Man Standing - S01E09
Guess Who's Coming To Dinner

01:34.883 --> 01:37.133
Original air date
November 29,2011

01:37.253 --> 01:39.811
Sync and corrected by Gatto
for www.addic7ed.com

01:39.931 --> 01:41.999
Ohh. Travis just tweeted that
he's staying in tonight.

01:42.033 --> 01:43.400
Ohh.

01:43.434 --> 01:46.336
He should tweet that he just set
the world record for boring.

01:46.371 --> 01:48.722
Excuse me.
My boyfriend isn't boring.

01:48.756 --> 01:50.440
What was his tweet before that?

01:50.475 --> 01:52.776
"I like mittens."

01:52.810 --> 01:55.562
(Chuckles)

01:55.597 --> 01:56.914
At least he's taking a stand
on something.

01:56.948 --> 01:57.931
Yeah.

01:57.982 --> 01:59.750
Hey. Big night tonight.
(Keys jangle)

01:59.784 --> 02:01.518
They are letting me close the diner.

02:01.552 --> 02:03.420
Forever?

02:03.454 --> 02:04.688
No, Mandy.
When they close it forever,

02:04.722 --> 02:07.407
they use a grease fire
and an insurance claim.

02:07.442 --> 02:08.775
Oh.

02:08.826 --> 02:10.360
Ohh, Mandy.
What?

02:10.394 --> 02:11.778
Travis was just tagged in a photo

02:11.829 --> 02:13.780
with Lizzie Trautwein one minute ago.

02:13.831 --> 02:15.565
Can't be. I told you
he's staying in tonight.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.367
Doesn't look like he's in,
but he is enjoying

02:17.401 --> 02:19.703
that apple pie she's feeding him.

02:19.737 --> 02:21.538
Travis lied to me?

02:21.572 --> 02:24.508
On--on a wildly popular
social network?

02:24.542 --> 02:26.593
I'm sure there's an explanation.

02:26.628 --> 02:28.712
Yeah. He's in love
with Lizzie Trautwein.

02:28.746 --> 02:32.082
What? How?
I don't understand.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.817
She has, like, freckles and glasses

02:33.851 --> 02:36.220
but acts like she doesn't.

02:36.254 --> 02:37.888
Come on, Mandy.
You're the first runner-up.

02:37.922 --> 02:39.656
Hold your head high.

02:41.693 --> 02:42.893
Hi.

02:42.927 --> 02:44.094
Hey.

02:46.598 --> 02:47.781
Are we having company?

02:47.815 --> 02:49.366
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you call me?

02:49.400 --> 02:50.367
Well, what would you have said?

02:50.401 --> 02:51.868
No.

02:51.903 --> 02:53.870
That's why I didn't call you.

02:53.905 --> 02:55.872
- Tonight?
- Why, you have plans?

02:55.907 --> 02:57.908
Yeah, a date with ESPN
and a plate of meat.

02:57.942 --> 02:59.209
Mm.

03:03.881 --> 03:07.551
Too bad. A new couple moved
into the house on the corner,

03:07.585 --> 03:10.003
and I met the wife
while I was power walking,

03:10.054 --> 03:11.655
and we really hit it off.

03:11.689 --> 03:14.057
Ah, sounds more like power <i>talking.</i>

03:14.092 --> 03:16.093
(Sighs) Oh, could you not say

03:16.127 --> 03:18.428
every smart-ass thing
that pops into your head?

03:18.462 --> 03:20.681
The scary thing is, I don't.

03:20.732 --> 03:22.683
(Nuts rattle)

03:22.734 --> 03:23.850
Well, Rebecca's really nice,

03:23.901 --> 03:25.852
so I invited them over for dinner.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.470
And so what does Mr. Rebecca do?

03:27.488 --> 03:28.605
I don't know.

03:28.639 --> 03:29.873
You guys will doing
your "girlie talk,"

03:29.907 --> 03:31.858
and I gotta deal with a guy
that probably h-has

03:31.909 --> 03:33.360
a chiropractor that's a wizard.

03:33.411 --> 03:34.695
"Let me show you on your back.

03:34.746 --> 03:35.862
Let me walk across your back."

03:35.913 --> 03:37.197
(Chuckles) (Doorbell rings)

03:37.248 --> 03:40.334
Oh, they're here. Do not eat
the hors d'oeuvres.

03:40.368 --> 03:42.502
Well, what are they here for?

03:42.537 --> 03:44.538
Hey, Rebecca.

03:44.589 --> 03:45.722
Hey, Vanessa.

03:45.757 --> 03:48.392
(Mouthing words)
Welcome to our humble abode.

03:48.426 --> 03:49.593
(Door closes)

03:49.627 --> 03:50.711
(Chuckles) Oh, you shouldn't have,

03:50.762 --> 03:53.397
but I'm glad you did.

03:53.431 --> 03:56.767
Come on in
and meet my grumpy husband.

03:59.437 --> 04:00.937
Hi. Mike Baxter.

04:00.972 --> 04:02.739
Hi. Rebecca Hatton.
Charlie's running a little late. Hi.

04:02.774 --> 04:04.558
Yeah. Lucky.

04:06.277 --> 04:08.445
Whenever there's anything
on about football, submarines,

04:08.479 --> 04:11.481
or quicksand, Charlie has
to rush home and record it.

04:11.516 --> 04:13.850
Yeah.
"Fast Death by Quicksand."

04:13.868 --> 04:17.120
I'm DVR'ing that myself.
That's cool.

04:17.154 --> 04:18.521
You know, we gotta meet
our neighbors more often.

04:18.539 --> 04:19.572
That's what I always say,

04:19.624 --> 04:20.690
we should meet
our neighbors more often,

04:20.708 --> 04:22.242
and we always fight about it.

04:22.293 --> 04:23.994
(Engine revs)

04:24.028 --> 04:25.729
Oh, that'll be Charlie.

04:25.763 --> 04:27.030
I know what you're thinking.
What kind of maniac rides

04:27.065 --> 04:28.899
a motorcycle at this time of year?

04:28.933 --> 04:30.801
(Doorbell rings) My kind of maniac.
I'll get it.

04:30.835 --> 04:32.636
(Ring) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:32.670 --> 04:33.870
(Ring)

04:33.888 --> 04:36.873
Come on.
Keep it in your pants.

04:36.891 --> 04:38.475
Hey, Char--

04:41.579 --> 04:43.447
I'll do my best.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.284
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

04:47.318 --> 04:49.219
- Of course. (Chuckles)
- (Chuckles)

04:49.237 --> 04:51.071
- Come in.
- Thank you.

04:52.857 --> 04:54.858
(Vanessa laughs) (Rebecca)
How do you possibly

04:54.892 --> 04:56.593
- get banned from a hot dog cart?
- Ohh. Oh.

04:56.627 --> 04:58.829
Look, when they start
watering down their mustard,

04:58.863 --> 05:01.698
I have a civic duty to start
screaming things at people.

05:01.733 --> 05:03.700
- I would do the same thing.
- You <i>do</i> do the same thing.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.168
I won't go to the movies
with her anymore

05:05.203 --> 05:06.503
'cause she's always
yelling at the screen.

05:06.537 --> 05:07.504
(Mike and Vanessa) Mm.

05:07.538 --> 05:08.872
- Mm.
- I'm sorry,

05:08.906 --> 05:11.341
but when 20 bad guys are
firing at Matt Damon,

05:11.376 --> 05:14.461
and they all miss, I'm gonna
shout some profanity.

05:14.512 --> 05:16.646
Well, what about this?

05:16.681 --> 05:17.848
He shoots 50 people, never reloads.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.383
I could sell a thousand
of those guns.

05:19.417 --> 05:20.384
I'll tell you that right now.

05:20.418 --> 05:22.018
(Laughs)

05:22.053 --> 05:23.086
They think we're idiots.

05:23.104 --> 05:24.221
Yeah. It's insulting is what it is.

05:24.255 --> 05:25.922
(Chuckles) Now you saw
that movie twice.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.557
You even bought the DVD.

05:27.592 --> 05:29.326
I like being angry.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.261
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
There's no better feeling.

05:31.295 --> 05:32.429
All right, it's late.

05:32.447 --> 05:33.814
We should probably go.

05:33.865 --> 05:35.365
- Oh, man. Boy, this has been fun.
- Ohh. This was nice.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.117
- (Mike and Vanessa) Yeah.
- Mike, I gotta be honest.

05:37.151 --> 05:38.869
I really didn't want
to come here tonight.

05:38.903 --> 05:42.038
There's nothing I dread more
than "meeting the neighbors."

05:42.073 --> 05:43.540
Hey, you're singing to the choir.

05:43.574 --> 05:44.541
Just 'cause your lawns touch

05:44.575 --> 05:46.993
doesn't mean you gotta be friends.

05:47.044 --> 05:50.380
Really? You two are bonding
over how much you hate bonding?

05:52.049 --> 05:54.551
Vanessa, Charlie and I are going
to the antique fair on Sunday.

05:54.585 --> 05:55.802
Oh, I'd love to go to that.

05:55.837 --> 05:57.320
Oh, good.
Now I don't have to.

05:57.355 --> 05:58.955
(Both chuckle)

05:58.973 --> 06:01.091
- Hey, listen, it's supposed to warm up this weekend...
- Mm-hmm.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.843
So while the ladies are perusing...

06:02.894 --> 06:04.661
- (Under breath) Old crap...
- (Chuckles) Yeah.

06:04.695 --> 06:05.796
(Normal voice)
What do you say you drag out

06:05.830 --> 06:07.364
that bike you've been boasting about

06:07.398 --> 06:09.733
and see if you can keep up with me?

06:09.767 --> 06:13.236
All right.
I'll lube up the chassis.

06:13.271 --> 06:15.638
Get the bike ready, too.

06:17.575 --> 06:19.659
Good times. (Chuckles)

06:19.694 --> 06:21.027
So should, uh...

06:21.078 --> 06:23.330
Uh, should Rebecca and I be jealous?

06:23.364 --> 06:26.917
No, the only man Charlie would
cross over for is John Elway.

06:26.951 --> 06:28.251
Same with Mike.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.337
(All laugh)

06:30.371 --> 06:32.672
Good night.

06:32.707 --> 06:34.424
See ya, guys.

06:39.481 --> 06:40.882
Travis won't call me back.

06:40.917 --> 06:43.652
Well, technically, your message
didn't say "call me back."

06:43.686 --> 06:46.621
It said, "I hope you die."

06:46.656 --> 06:49.374
He knows that
that means "call me back."

06:50.793 --> 06:53.128
Oh, my God. I have an idea.
Okay, guys.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.796
When Britney and Justin
broke up, what did he do?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.381
Um, hook up with what's-her-name.

06:56.415 --> 06:57.883
- Before that.
- Hook up with what's-her-name.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.534
- Before that.
- Oh.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.503
- (Both) Hook up with what's-her-name!
- No! Everyone, shut up. No.

07:01.537 --> 07:03.588
He made "Cry Me a River,"

07:03.639 --> 07:05.974
the single greatest
revenge breakup video

07:06.008 --> 07:08.093
of all time, and that's our move.

07:08.144 --> 07:09.778
But he's Justin Timberlake.

07:09.812 --> 07:13.515
So what? We--we are
The Inglorious Baxters,

07:13.549 --> 07:14.733
and we are going to make

07:14.767 --> 07:17.519
the new greatest revenge
breakup video of all time.

07:17.553 --> 07:18.854
We? No, no, no, no, no.
No. No, no.

07:18.888 --> 07:19.855
Do not drag me into this.

07:19.889 --> 07:21.022
Kristin, look at me.

07:21.057 --> 07:23.942
I will give you 20 hours
of free babysitting.

07:23.993 --> 07:26.661
Let's shoot it right here
in the diner.

07:26.696 --> 07:27.863
Hey, Eve. Listen to me.

07:27.897 --> 07:29.130
I know you don't like to dance,
but hear me out.

07:29.165 --> 07:33.201
Whoa. I do like to dance.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.754
Moving on.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.873
Travis wants pie, huh?
(Chuckles) Oh.

07:37.907 --> 07:42.043
I'm gonna give him pie till he <i>cries.</i>

07:42.078 --> 07:43.211
The song will be called "pie rack."

07:43.245 --> 07:44.846
(Claps hands) Yes.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.214
Okay, we roll camera phones
after closing.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.966
That gives me
approximately 45 minutes

07:48.017 --> 07:50.886
to conceptualize, write, score,
choreograph the whole thing.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.087
It's not gonna be easy.

07:52.121 --> 07:54.523
I'm not used to work
of any kind. (Chuckles)

07:54.557 --> 07:56.641
Do you need to go somewhere quiet?

07:56.692 --> 07:59.327
I don't even know. (Sighs)

08:00.863 --> 08:03.315
There's something about
that Charlie I like.

08:03.366 --> 08:05.150
Well, of course.
She's exactly like you.

08:05.201 --> 08:06.501
(Scoffs) It's not...
(Clattering)

08:06.536 --> 08:07.669
It's not that.

08:07.703 --> 08:09.821
I mean, she's smart,
insightful, and funny.

08:09.872 --> 08:10.839
Oh, I get your point.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.841
Yeah.

08:12.875 --> 08:14.075
(Dishes clatter)

08:14.110 --> 08:15.710
I just think it's kinda weird,

08:15.745 --> 08:18.179
you planning a whole day
with another woman.

08:18.214 --> 08:19.998
I mean, it's...
I could barely get you

08:20.049 --> 08:22.000
to even come to our rehearsal dinner.

08:22.051 --> 08:23.852
What's to rehearse about dinner?

08:23.886 --> 08:26.688
You eat. You go home.

08:26.722 --> 08:29.674
And why is she any different
than Phillip at your office?

08:29.725 --> 08:31.509
- No, no, no.
- You know, you guys go shopping together.

08:31.561 --> 08:33.010
He's in the dressing room with you.

08:33.062 --> 08:35.013
No, it's different. It is.

08:35.063 --> 08:36.364
Why is it different?

08:36.399 --> 08:38.198
Why is it okay for a woman
to have gay male friends

08:38.234 --> 08:39.801
and it's not the other way around?

08:39.818 --> 08:43.321
How come I can't have a gaggle
of lesbians hanging out with me?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.361
(Sighs)

08:49.412 --> 08:52.047
I wish I could be a lesbian.

08:53.249 --> 08:55.250
It's not that hard.

08:56.652 --> 08:58.370
No.

08:58.421 --> 09:00.589
What I mean is, uh... (Sighs)
It must be nice to have

09:00.623 --> 09:03.157
a partner you can share
your clothes with.

09:03.175 --> 09:06.044
When one talks,
the second one really listens,

09:06.095 --> 09:09.097
and when the second one talks,
the first one really listens.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.550
Boy... (Chuckles)
I could <i>never</i> be a lesbian.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.004
Okay. Thank you so much.

09:16.038 --> 09:18.974
Yes. Been such a pleasure
waiting for you to leave.

09:19.008 --> 09:20.775
(Lock clicks, keys jangle)

09:20.810 --> 09:22.210
Eve, what are you doing?

09:22.244 --> 09:25.246
This is what
real directors do. Just...

09:25.281 --> 09:27.048
Okay, can you just turn
the camera on, please?

09:27.083 --> 09:29.183
All right.
Places, everybody.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.353
Rehearsal. Now remember,
we are all waitresses,

09:32.371 --> 09:35.457
we all hate Travis,
and we're all holding pies, yes?

09:35.491 --> 09:37.075
So just, um, follow my lead,

09:37.126 --> 09:38.076
and then we'll fix
the rest in editing.

What?

10:17.133 --> 10:20.068
Hey, Kyle. If your chest
were more concave,

10:20.102 --> 10:22.470
we could fill it with birdseed.

10:22.505 --> 10:24.739
(Chuckles) Good one, sir.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.075
- Uh, say, Mr. Alzate...
- Huh? Yeah.

Kyle, you, by far, are
the most inept ballbuster

10:43.959 --> 10:45.393
I've ever met.

10:45.427 --> 10:47.595
Oh.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.531
"Oh, no, you didn't."

10:56.739 --> 10:58.773
I'm looking forward
to that ride with Charlie.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.876
Oh, you're fooling
yourself, Mike. Come on.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.979
You cannot be friends with a woman.

11:05.014 --> 11:07.982
What are you talking about?
We both have women friends.

11:08.017 --> 11:11.686
Not me. I have <i>lovers.</i>

11:13.255 --> 11:16.024
You make that word sound creepy.

11:16.058 --> 11:17.525
<i>Lovers.</i>

11:17.560 --> 11:19.561
Stop it.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.697
Besides... (Chuckles)
Charlie's actually, uh,

11:22.732 --> 11:24.199
more like a guy.

11:24.233 --> 11:25.567
Yeah? In what way?

11:25.601 --> 11:27.669
Uh, she likes women.

11:27.703 --> 11:31.272
Oh, I wasn't aware
of her sapphic leanings.

11:31.306 --> 11:34.075
She's not leaning.
She's tipped all the way over.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.777
Mm.

11:35.811 --> 11:38.680
No doubt to the great delight
of her <i>lovers.</i>

11:38.714 --> 11:41.382
Shut up.

11:41.417 --> 11:43.752
So your new friend has,
uh, a predilection

11:43.786 --> 11:46.888
for the secret garden, hmm?

11:46.922 --> 11:48.623
Let's not judge, Ed.

11:48.657 --> 11:49.707
No, no, no, no, no.

11:49.759 --> 11:52.026
"Live and let love"
is what I always say.

11:52.061 --> 11:54.195
Yeah, but, uh, watch out, Mike.

11:54.230 --> 11:56.531
She may seem like snips
and snails and puppy dog tails,

11:56.565 --> 11:58.366
but inside, a woman is still a woman.

11:58.400 --> 11:59.367
(Chuckles) Mm?

11:59.401 --> 12:00.368
Thank you, Billy Joel.

12:00.402 --> 12:02.203
Mm. I'm just saying,

they're a different animal from us...

12:03.806 --> 12:04.773
- I know.
- A-all right?

12:04.807 --> 12:05.840
- Yeah.

just like when you were
little girls on a rainy day.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.886
(Chuckles) Mm.

We're going antiquing.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.855
Oh, that sounds fun.

12:53.889 --> 12:54.856
Yeah, doesn't it?

12:54.890 --> 12:56.908
(Chuckles) No.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.228
Do you guys think Rebecca
and Charlie ever fight,

13:00.246 --> 13:02.396
or do they just talk

13:02.414 --> 13:04.199
and share for hours

13:04.233 --> 13:06.201
and agree on things

13:06.235 --> 13:10.104
and wander around farmers' markets?

13:10.139 --> 13:13.341
Mom, are you jealous of lesbians?

13:14.410 --> 13:16.544
No. (Chuckles) No, no.

13:16.578 --> 13:20.915
Honey, I've made my choices,
and I am stuck with them.

13:26.755 --> 13:29.891
So how did my exhaust taste?

13:29.925 --> 13:32.393
Better than those sandwiches
you made us stop for.

13:32.427 --> 13:34.963
Those weren't sandwiches.
Those were paninis.

13:34.997 --> 13:36.364
Paninis?

13:36.398 --> 13:37.866
I think that's the gayest thing
I've ever heard.

13:39.869 --> 13:41.736
(Chuckles) That's just
'cause you're a sore loser.

13:41.770 --> 13:44.572
Oh, please.
I let you pass me.

13:44.607 --> 13:47.709
Sort of a senior discount.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.745
Speaking of discount,
that leather jacket's nice.

13:50.779 --> 13:53.982
I didn't know that goodwill
had a gay section.

13:54.016 --> 13:57.418
Oh. (Laughing loudly)
Oh, that's so... oh.

13:57.453 --> 13:58.920
See, that's how lesbians laugh

13:58.954 --> 14:00.722
when they think
something's not funny.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.423
Are you thirsty?

14:02.457 --> 14:04.342
Let's watch a little bit
of the Bronco game.

14:04.393 --> 14:05.510
Read my mind.
(Chuckles)

14:05.561 --> 14:07.362
Now seriously, why do you think

14:07.396 --> 14:09.180
my bike's getting loose
on the corners?

14:09.231 --> 14:10.848
Well, with your low center
of gravity,

14:10.900 --> 14:13.368
you should be carving up those turns.

14:13.402 --> 14:15.186
What--what does that mean?

14:15.237 --> 14:16.871
Well, you've heard
of "junk in the trunk."

14:16.906 --> 14:19.374
You've got a whole garage sale
going on back there.

14:19.408 --> 14:20.708
(Chuckles)

14:20.743 --> 14:22.994
You think I have a big butt?

14:23.028 --> 14:25.046
Well, it's bigger
than this one down <i>here.</i>

14:25.080 --> 14:26.447
(Chuckles)

14:26.481 --> 14:28.416
I think I'm gonna go.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.085
Why? The game's gonna start
in, like, 20 minutes.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.453
No, that's all right.

14:32.487 --> 14:35.039
I don't want to take up
too much space on your couch.

14:35.090 --> 14:38.092
Oh, come on. I took a shot.
I was just kidding around.

14:38.127 --> 14:39.394
See ya later.

14:39.428 --> 14:41.062
(Chuckles)
(Door closes)

14:41.096 --> 14:42.397

14:52.047 --> 14:56.439
Mike?
What did you say to Charlie?

14:56.473 --> 14:58.641
Oh.
(Turns off TV)

14:58.675 --> 15:02.328
I might have intimated that
she's got a big caboose.

15:02.362 --> 15:03.846
What?

15:03.880 --> 15:05.147
You know, we were just
taking shots at each other.

15:05.182 --> 15:07.082
I was treating her like
one of the guys.

15:07.117 --> 15:08.451
But she is not one of the guys.

15:08.485 --> 15:09.819
I mean, there is not
a woman in the world

15:09.853 --> 15:11.320
who would think that's funny.

15:11.354 --> 15:13.522
I know that now.

15:13.557 --> 15:15.758
Do you have any idea what it is like

15:15.792 --> 15:18.611
to come back from a day of
antiquing with your new friend

15:18.662 --> 15:21.130
and find her partner crying
in her motorcycle clothes

15:21.164 --> 15:22.765
on the front porch?

15:24.100 --> 15:26.202
No, I do not.

15:26.236 --> 15:30.572
Well, it's... weird. (Sighs)

15:30.590 --> 15:32.174
Yeah, and now Rebecca's mad at me

15:32.209 --> 15:34.076
because Charlie's mad at you,

15:34.110 --> 15:36.078
and I'm mad at you because
Rebecca's mad at me... (Sighs)

15:36.112 --> 15:38.247
So you need to fix things
with Charlie

15:38.265 --> 15:39.915
so that Rebecca and I can be okay.

15:39.950 --> 15:44.954
Hmm. Hmm. Why didn't
she go inside to cry?

15:44.988 --> 15:47.256
Really?

15:47.274 --> 15:49.825
And that's--that's your takeaway?

16:59.129 --> 17:01.680
Not so good.

and she snapped.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.034
(Singsongy) I told you.

17:05.068 --> 17:06.602
But she tricked me.

17:06.636 --> 17:09.038
I thought it was a man
in the shape of a woman.

17:09.071 --> 17:13.108
Turns out to be a woman
in the shape of a woman.

17:13.143 --> 17:16.811
Just because she likes women
doesn't make her less of one.

17:16.846 --> 17:18.614
Well, it ought to.

17:50.931 --> 17:53.899
He left me one, two, three,
four, five crying messages,

17:53.934 --> 17:55.901
which are all available
as audio downloads

17:55.936 --> 17:56.902
on my home page.

17:56.937 --> 17:58.187
(Snaps cell phone shut)

17:58.221 --> 17:59.421
(Door closes)

17:59.456 --> 18:01.590
So how does it feel
to clear your life of men?

18:01.625 --> 18:03.859
Awesome. You know, I think
this will be good for me,

18:03.893 --> 18:06.946
like, a time of focus
and self-renewal.

18:06.997 --> 18:09.164
Wow. This is a whole new side to you.

18:09.199 --> 18:10.866
Ooh.
400 boys posted comments?

18:10.900 --> 18:12.701
And there's the old side.

18:12.735 --> 18:15.804
All right. I'm going
to the movies with Kyle.

18:15.839 --> 18:16.905
And I am gonna go on a first date

18:16.923 --> 18:18.907
with Dylan Damischek.
Oh, no, no, no.

18:18.925 --> 18:21.093
Seth Thornton.
"Mandy Thornton."

18:21.127 --> 18:22.211
Ooh. No, no, no. Boyd Baxter.

18:22.245 --> 18:24.046
Oh, who's he?
Uh, my son, your nephew,

18:24.080 --> 18:26.048
and the kid you promised
you'd babysit tonight.

18:26.082 --> 18:29.101
He will want you to read
this book 20 to 30 times.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.972
Come on. I don't want
to stay in tonight.

18:33.023 --> 18:35.491
Oh, my God. So many hot guys
are poking me right now.

18:35.525 --> 18:36.591
(Giggling)

18:36.609 --> 18:37.776
(Mouths words)

18:41.597 --> 18:43.232
Are you trying to kill me?

18:43.266 --> 18:46.068
(Chuckles) Daddy, it's an expression.

18:46.102 --> 18:48.237
But a terrible one.

18:48.271 --> 18:49.405
Has anyone poked me?

18:49.439 --> 18:50.906
(Chuckles) Could we?

18:50.940 --> 18:53.575
(Laughs)

18:53.610 --> 18:55.411
- (Eve and Vanessa) Hey.
- (Chuckles)

18:55.445 --> 18:58.080
(Chuckles) Ooh.
What do you have there?

18:58.114 --> 18:59.465
An apology gift. I'm gonna
go over to Charlie's

18:59.499 --> 19:01.216
and try to smooth things out
with her.

19:01.251 --> 19:03.886
Oh. Well, you've never given me
a gift when you apologize.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.170
I would go broke.

19:05.221 --> 19:07.389
Oh. (Chuckles)

19:07.424 --> 19:09.341
It's a little skull
and crossbones key chain.

19:09.392 --> 19:11.427
It will go with her bandanna.
You think she'll like it?

19:11.461 --> 19:15.864
I don't know. We're in
some weird territory here.

19:15.899 --> 19:17.149
Want me to go with you?

19:17.183 --> 19:19.018
No. It's one of those times in life

19:19.069 --> 19:23.672
that a man has to apologize
to a lesbian by himself.

19:23.707 --> 19:25.708
Don't try to joke your way out of it.

19:25.742 --> 19:27.026
Just say "I'm sorry"

19:27.077 --> 19:28.877
and get out of there
as quickly as possible.

19:28.912 --> 19:30.529
Right.
Just like our honeymoon.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.614
(Both chuckle)

19:32.648 --> 19:34.383
Maybe you should just write a note.

19:34.417 --> 19:36.452
All right.
I'll be back when--

19:36.486 --> 19:38.687
oh, hey. I was just coming
over to your house.

19:38.722 --> 19:39.821
Oh. Can I come in?

19:39.839 --> 19:41.623
- Yeah, please.
- Thanks.

19:41.657 --> 19:46.395
Um... listen, uh, sometimes
I forget that there's

19:46.429 --> 19:48.764
ways of connecting
that don't involve insults.

19:48.798 --> 19:51.133
Actually, uh, I came
to say I'm sorry.

19:51.167 --> 19:52.301
You're sorry?

19:52.335 --> 19:54.103
Yeah. I overreacted.

19:54.137 --> 19:56.371
Rebecca reminded me that
if I'm gonna hang out with a guy

19:56.406 --> 19:59.341
and dish it out, that I've
gotta be willing to take it.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.643
Having said that, if you so much
as mention my ass again...

20:01.678 --> 20:03.479
(Chuckles) I will clock you.

20:03.513 --> 20:05.414
- Right. Hey.
- Is that for me?

20:05.448 --> 20:07.282
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Oh. Thanks.

20:07.317 --> 20:08.534
Uh, do you have time for a beer?

20:08.568 --> 20:10.119
No. I'll take a rain check.

20:10.153 --> 20:11.587
I gotta get back to
the ball and chain. (Chuckles)

20:11.621 --> 20:13.288
Oh. Rebecca, huh?

20:13.323 --> 20:14.740
No. Our new toy.

20:14.791 --> 20:16.859
Therapist thinks we need
to bring the surprise back

20:16.893 --> 20:18.827
to our romance, you know what I mean?

20:18.861 --> 20:20.362
