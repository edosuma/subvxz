Narrator:
Tonight on "MasterChef"...

00:03.403 --> 00:05.405
- Ashley: Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

00:05.439 --> 00:07.474
Ashley:
They're landing for dinner!

00:07.507 --> 00:10.344
when the top 10 cook
for American heroes...

00:10.377 --> 00:13.413
100 airmen.
This is massive!

00:13.447 --> 00:15.716
- expectations...
- Hanger steak.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.752
- That's a no-no.
- ...are sky-high.

00:17.785 --> 00:21.155
- These are incinerated.
- How do we serve that
to the Air Force?

00:21.188 --> 00:23.057
- ( plate shatters )
- Emily: Oh, my God!

00:23.090 --> 00:24.524
We're getting invaded...

00:24.558 --> 00:26.160
Joe:
This pork chop's
completely raw.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.561
...and I'm about to call
for a mayday,

00:27.594 --> 00:29.930
because we all might
be going down.

00:29.964 --> 00:31.966
Go away. Go away.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.342
MasterChef zero-niner.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.678
March Tower,
check wheels down.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.214
Runway three two,
wind at three, one,
zero at four.

00:47.247 --> 00:48.548
Clear to land.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.184
Gordon:
Roger that, March Tower.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.952
Cleared for landing,
see you on the deck.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.893
( cheers and applause )

00:58.926 --> 01:01.228
Cesar:
Making top 10 is
a huge achievement.

01:01.261 --> 01:02.429
It's mental strength.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.464
It's emotional fortitude.

01:04.498 --> 01:07.134
It's not an achievement that
should be taken for granted.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.136
I've never seen a drone
in person.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.871
Emily:
We've got drones

01:10.905 --> 01:13.974
and cargo planes
and fighter jets.

01:14.008 --> 01:16.310
So this is obviously
our battleground,

01:16.343 --> 01:18.412
and we're here today
to fight it out.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.616
I just know something crazy
is about to happen.

01:24.651 --> 01:26.753
Gerron: That's dope!
You see that?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.255
Oh! What is this?

01:32.159 --> 01:34.829
( cheers and applause )

01:34.862 --> 01:37.497
Gerron: All of a sudden,
Aarón and Joe pop up.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.733
I'm like, "What the hell?"

01:39.766 --> 01:41.468
These guys come in crazy
every time.

01:41.501 --> 01:42.870
- Who's that in the jet?
- Yeah, no, he's moving.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.410
- No! No way!
- Oh, my God!

01:50.444 --> 01:52.112
- No way!
- Oh!

01:52.146 --> 01:54.381
- No!
- No way.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.618
Chef Ramsay's dope.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.089
( cheering )

02:02.122 --> 02:03.924
Shanika:
These guys look so cute!

02:03.958 --> 02:05.659
They've got their little
glasses on.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.495
Gordon comes out
of the damn jet.

02:08.528 --> 02:09.930
This is cool.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.199
Welcome to March
Air Reserve Base.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.601
( cheering )

02:14.634 --> 02:18.505
The March Air Reserve Base
is one of the oldest

02:18.538 --> 02:20.607
and one of the most
prolific airfields

02:20.640 --> 02:22.642
operated by the
United States military.

02:22.676 --> 02:26.146
The base actually opened
its doors in 1918,

02:26.180 --> 02:29.483
which means this year
it's celebrating

02:29.516 --> 02:32.386
its hundredth anniversary.

02:32.419 --> 02:36.456
And today, you guys will be
splitting up into two teams

02:36.490 --> 02:39.526
to cook for 100 airmen.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.995
Awesome. Yes!

02:41.028 --> 02:42.796
I feel so honored.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.565
My grandfather was a part
of the Air Force,

02:45.599 --> 02:49.636
and I have a huge respect
for where we are right now.

02:49.669 --> 02:50.971
This is incredible.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.207
Emily and Cesar,

02:53.240 --> 02:55.209
because you did the best in
the halibut skills challenge,

02:55.242 --> 02:58.845
today, you will be
our team captains.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.681
Samantha:
I'm not thrilled about Emily
or Cesar for captain.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.717
Cesar can be a little
overbearing.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.321
And I think Emily is just kind
of pretentious, honestly.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.090
- Emily, how are you feeling?
- I run a team
of project analysts

03:10.124 --> 03:11.758
that do primary research.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.527
So, I mean, the kitchen should
be run no differently.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.695
I think it's my time to shine.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.564
Well, very,
very interesting information.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.599
- Uh-oh.
- But today,

03:19.633 --> 03:22.436
your teams are picking you.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.871
- Mm.
- Of course.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.841
If you wanna be
on Emily's team,

03:27.874 --> 03:29.609
you will stand over
to the right.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.179
If you wanna be
on Cesar's team,

03:32.212 --> 03:34.248
you'll go on the left.

03:34.281 --> 03:37.117
Back in my playground days,
I was always kind of second,

03:37.151 --> 03:39.686
if not last pick for sports.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.122
So, hopefully, more than one
person walks over to my side.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.557
Does everyone know
where they're going?

03:43.590 --> 03:44.891
- Yes.
- Yes.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.563
In one, two, three. Go.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.303
- Gordon: Wow. Wow!
- Joe: Wow! Interesting.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.705
Even.

03:58.738 --> 04:01.075
I've never seen such a clear
decision-making take place

04:01.108 --> 04:02.809
in the history of
this competition.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.079
Wow. Right, captains,
please head over

04:05.112 --> 04:07.982
and give your teams their
aprons, please. Thank you.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.617
I'm really, really happy
to be on Cesar's team,

04:10.650 --> 04:12.919
because Emily,
she is so controlling.

04:12.953 --> 04:17.057
Red team, blue team, you will
have 75 minutes to prep

04:17.091 --> 04:21.295
and just 60 minutes to cook
100 composed plates.

04:21.328 --> 04:23.297
Make "MasterChef" proud.

04:23.330 --> 04:27.001
If you don't, you'll be heading
straight into battle

04:27.034 --> 04:28.802
in the dreaded pressure test.

04:28.835 --> 04:31.305
- Okay?
- All: Yes, Chef!

04:31.338 --> 04:35.275
Your time starts...

04:35.309 --> 04:36.676
...now.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.445
- Here we go, guys.
- Let's go.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.080
Gordon:
Let's go.

04:40.114 --> 04:42.916
- Whoo!
- Aarón: Come on, guys.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.185
All right, guys, what protein
are y'all thinking about?

04:45.219 --> 04:46.987
I think the hanger steak.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.189
I mean, we're in a hangar.
A hanger steak.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.424
Yeah, that makes sense.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.259
What are y'all thinking
for sides?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.428
- I'm thinking asparagus.
- Yeah, I think the asparagus.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.630
- Just do it nice and simple
in the oven.
- Okay.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.099
And then I can do a polenta cake
and I can even put some
goat cheese in there.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.368
- I like that. Okay, okay.
- Make it a little bit sharper.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.838
The pressure on a captain
during any team challenge
is incredible.

05:04.871 --> 05:09.609
Your team can die or live
by a single decision
the captain makes.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.545
So I know that's already
on my shoulders.

05:11.578 --> 05:14.148
- Are we gonna grill?
- Because of the wind,

05:14.181 --> 05:15.515
I think the grill's
not gonna get hot enough.

05:15.549 --> 05:16.683
We'll go pan-sear.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.652
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.954
I don't think pan-sear
is a great idea.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.124
We have such a big grill here
for a reason.

05:24.158 --> 05:25.659
I am not cool with that.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.162
Cesar:
Come on, guys.
Let's do this.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.297
What are our first thoughts
on proteins?

05:30.330 --> 05:32.032
- Salmon.
- I'm thinking salmon as well.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.668
Pork, I think, is an easier go
when it comes

05:34.701 --> 05:37.171
- to marking,
finish in the oven--
- Okay, but what I feel like

05:37.204 --> 05:39.206
with the salmon is, we have
a hundred people to feed.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.675
How can we get this pork done
in time to feed a 101 people?

05:41.708 --> 05:44.411
Because we have 75 minutes
to prep before we even serve.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.380
Shanika:
I think pork chop
is a mistake.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.315
Salmon doesn't take
that long to cook.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.750
We can be a little
bit more organized,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.419
but pork chop it shall be.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.188
What do you think about doing,
like, a peach chutney

05:54.221 --> 05:55.655
- to go along
with the pork chop?
- Yes, yes.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.991
Peaches, pork go really well
with balsamic.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.094
- If we do--
- No balsamic, no balsamic.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.862
If we throw balsamic in a pan
and reduce it down to a glaze,

06:02.896 --> 06:05.099
it's one of our garnish
elements on the plate.

06:05.132 --> 06:06.500
- Balsamic and peaches
don't go together.
- But we're keeping it separate,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.368
so, we don't--
They do, they do.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.104
But when you eat,
you eat a combination
of everything together.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.538
- It doesn't go.
- I'm saying that's our--

06:11.571 --> 06:13.107
Have you ever heard of
a peach balsamic dressing?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.109
You know, Shanika,
this is not the Shanika show.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.577
This is "MasterChef."
Either get on board

06:17.611 --> 06:20.847
or you need to rethink maybe
what team you chose to be on.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.749
No matter what,
we need a ( bleep ) plan B.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.518
Period. We need a plan B.

06:24.551 --> 06:27.521
This is going to be a battle.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.289
Joe:
Very exciting luncheon.

06:29.323 --> 06:30.724
The bar is super high.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.059
Two amazing captains
in Emily and Cesar.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.195
Julia:
We can do triangles
of polenta.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.531
- And then the sauce
on the side.
- I like that idea.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.700
Now, Cesar's a talented,
super smart teacher.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.270
Will he have the vocal cords
today to lead his team
to victory?

06:43.303 --> 06:44.871
I don't know how much
of a leader he really is.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.540
I don't know how vocal
he can be.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.109
- So-- Yeah.
- Are you sure you wanna
just do the ends?

06:49.143 --> 06:52.246
I feel like this is
a waste of asparagus,
just cutting the tips off.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.814
Cesar:
We're looking good, guys.
Just keep going at this speed.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.250
Blue team captained by Emily.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.752
Smart, articulate, vocal.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.255
Do all the peaches,
you guys.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.889
Do not underestimate
a hundred portions.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.824
Joe:
She's got all the makings

07:04.858 --> 07:07.060
to be a true chef
in a field challenge.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.163
Let's see if she can rise
to that occasion today.

07:11.165 --> 07:13.800
Emily:
A lot of salt.
Yeah, yeah.

07:13.833 --> 07:16.236
- Okay.
- The salt is like a quick
brine, and it actually acts

07:16.270 --> 07:18.805
- to make the pork moister
once we cook it. Okay?
- Okay.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.175
So, Emily, please,
describe your dish.

07:21.208 --> 07:23.477
Yeah, so we are doing
a grilled pork chop

07:23.510 --> 07:27.147
over sautéed Swiss chard,
a cauliflower puree,

07:27.181 --> 07:28.815
and a peach chutney.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.518
A bone-in pork chop for me
is a high degree of risk.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.320
- Yeah.
- How you gonna cook it?

07:33.353 --> 07:35.489
We're grilling it and then
finishing it in the oven.

07:35.522 --> 07:38.825
I think presentation-wise
and flavor-wise,
it's worth the risk.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.127
If you nail it, it's great,
but you could go a safer route.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.962
- That's true.
- Who made that decision, you?

07:42.996 --> 07:45.098
- I did make that decision.
- All right.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.800
- Live and die by it.
- Hoping I don't live
to regret it.

07:46.833 --> 07:49.203
I hope not.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.771
- Right, Cesar.
- Yes, Chef.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.540
Give me an insight to the dish.
What are you doing?

07:53.573 --> 07:55.809
All right, so we're doing
a pan-seared hanger steak, Chef.

07:55.842 --> 07:59.045
We're gonna brush it
with chimichurri sauce
right before it's done.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.315
We're doing a goat cheese
polenta, sautéed asparagus,

08:01.348 --> 08:04.651
and I'm doing a red jalapeño
and peach salsa to go with it.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.953
So, we're talking about
pan-seared hanger steak.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.489
That's a no-no, right there.
Big no-no.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.724
What does a hanger steak need?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.392
- It needs high--
- Charring.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.461
- It needs high heat.
- High intensity. There we go.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.330
- Yes, Chef. Mm-hmm.
- Okay?

08:16.363 --> 08:17.964
The grill's there,
nobody's using it.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.634
- Yes, Chef.
- I'm trying to help here.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.902
- Okay? Samantha.
- Yes, Chef.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.805
- What are you doing?
- I'm cutting asparagus.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.841
- Cutting asparagus.
- Yep.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.709
Oh, my Lord.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.978
- Look at me.
- Yes.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.547
They're young asparagus.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.482
- They're weeks old.
- Yeah.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.584
They're delicious.
Why are we cutting
off the best part?

08:37.617 --> 08:39.686
I-- I was doing
what I was told, Chef.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.888
- I was told to cut them off.
- Cesar, come over, please.

08:41.921 --> 08:44.324
Yes, Chef.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.493
- Are you upset with me?
- No, Chef, I'm not upset
with you.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.662
But-- But look! This is
all going in the trash.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.365
- I'm upset about that.
- So why do it?

08:51.398 --> 08:53.367
Samantha:
I'm pissed right now.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.502
I told Cesar in the beginning

08:55.535 --> 08:57.003
that we shouldn't be
cutting it that way.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.172
- Look. Trash. Hey!
- I know. I know.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.441
- Air Force. Trash. Air Force.
- Yeah.

09:01.475 --> 09:03.510
I don't get it.

09:03.543 --> 09:07.180
If we go down because of
something as simple
as roasted asparagus,

09:07.213 --> 09:08.615
that is on you, Cesar.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.257
- Gordon: Red team.
- Red team: Yes, Chef.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.225
How do we serve that
to the Air Force?

09:19.259 --> 09:20.727
I-- I'm sorry, Chef.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.128
I should've spoken up
a little bit more.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.364
Honestly, guys,
this is so stupid.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.032
Yeah, I agree.

09:26.065 --> 09:27.567
I'm pissed about this
right now.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.569
I have my mentor
Chef Gordon Ramsay

09:29.603 --> 09:32.071
yelling at me for how
this asparagus is cut,

09:32.105 --> 09:34.374
when Cesar told me to do it.
Thanks a lot, Cesar.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.876
Please, work with your brains.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.812
- All: Yes, Chef.
- Thank you. Come on!

09:38.845 --> 09:41.948
Guys, if you open the oven,
close it, please.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.984
- Sam, you gotta keep your cool.
- I am trying, Cesar!

09:45.018 --> 09:47.321
I'm just trying to do what
everybody is telling me to do.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.394
Remember who
we're cooking for, y'all.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.129
Focus on that meat, Ashley.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.897
Guys, guys, guys,
don't do this.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.933
Unbelievable.
Guys, these are incinerated.

09:59.966 --> 10:02.669
- Big mistake. Oh, my God.
- Aarón: Get 'em out.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.170
Finish 'em in the oven.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.773
Emily, what problem
do you see here already?

10:06.806 --> 10:08.475
Well, this is not done.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.344
- This is totally burnt.
- Burnt.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.746
- How's that gonna look
on a dish? No.
- Not great.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.814
You don't realize
how much pressure

10:14.848 --> 10:16.850
the team captain is under

10:16.883 --> 10:18.418
until you're actually put
in that situation.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.953
Flip 'em, flip 'em,
flip 'em, go!

10:19.986 --> 10:22.188
Work faster, faster,
faster, faster.
There you go.

10:22.221 --> 10:24.824
Joe: This is like a ( bleep )
comedy show, these two
on the grill.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.860
- This one's rare.
And this one's burnt.
- Yes.

10:26.893 --> 10:30.797
The pork chops are
at the same time being
burnt and undercooked.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.298
Oh, my God, guys.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.934
I can't serve
a black pork chop.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.170
I mean, at this point
I'm about to call for a mayday,

10:37.203 --> 10:38.738
because we might be
going down.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.317
- Oh, there they are.
There they are. Look.
- Oh, wow.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.719
How cool is that?

10:52.752 --> 10:55.455
Red team, blue team,
our guests are arriving.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.391
Look. Parachutes in the air.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.026
Gerron:
Wow!

11:00.059 --> 11:01.495
- Whoa!
- Oh!

11:01.528 --> 11:04.464
Is that a bird, a plane?

11:04.498 --> 11:07.333
No, it's airmen falling
from the sky.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.973
Emily:
Our guests are arriving, guys!

11:14.007 --> 11:15.975
Farhan:
Wow.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.512
Emily:
Guys, this is insane.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.079
Wow, that's incredible.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.082
- Look at that.
- Whoa!

11:23.116 --> 11:24.551
Aarón:
Unbelievable. Look at this.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.520
Samantha:
Airmen are coming from the sky.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.922
They're coming from behind
all the planes.

11:28.955 --> 11:30.590
They're coming
from all angles.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.759
They're invading
our kitchens right now.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.494
- Whoa!
- Guys, keep working.

11:34.528 --> 11:36.863
- Don't look up at the sky.
- Yep. Okay.

11:36.896 --> 11:38.432
Are they gonna help us plate?
'Cause I don't think so.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.368
- Hello, hello.
- Oh, my God!

11:42.402 --> 11:44.337
- They're landing for dinner.
- Farhan: Wow!

11:44.370 --> 11:46.906
I see why the Air Force
is the Air Force.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.610
These are people that work
so hard to keep us safe.

11:50.644 --> 11:53.613
And we really wanna
do our best with this meal.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.115
Gordon:
Red team, blue team,
guests are lining up.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.717
Start to serve, please.
Let's go!

11:57.751 --> 11:59.753
Come on, guys!
We're serving now!

11:59.786 --> 12:01.621
- All right, heard serving.
- Julia: Thank you.

12:01.655 --> 12:04.023
Taylor:
Thank you so much
for your service.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.760
Cesar:
We have a grilled
hanger steak,

12:06.793 --> 12:08.962
goat cheese polenta,
roasted asparagus,

12:08.995 --> 12:11.197
and peach
and red jalapeño salsa.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.433
- Joe: Here they come.
- Thank you.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.968
Thank you so much
for your service.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.269
Emily:
We got a grilled pork chop

12:16.302 --> 12:18.071
over sautéed Swiss chard.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.372
We've got a cauliflower puree

12:19.405 --> 12:20.774
topped with a peach chutney.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.141
Emily:
Shanika, I will do the greens.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.610
Um, okay.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.112
Can you start placing
our pork chops, please?

12:26.145 --> 12:28.381
Oh, my God! Look at this one.
Look at this one.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.249
- Shanika: The hell
we was thinking.
- Emily: Let me check.

12:30.283 --> 12:31.718
Let you check this?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.487
Whoo! I did not know
coming into this team

12:33.520 --> 12:34.821
that Emily was so controlling.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.790
This is-- This one's rare.

12:36.823 --> 12:37.791
This is why I wanted to do
the damn salmon, captain.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.759
( groans )

12:39.793 --> 12:41.495
Honestly, Shanika
is the only person left

12:41.528 --> 12:43.663
who is still hanging on
to the salmon.

12:43.697 --> 12:45.665
Shanika, do you feel
comfortable cooking pork?

12:45.699 --> 12:47.567
- Hell, nah. I'll plate.
- Oh, great.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.002
I told you I didn't
wanna do this damn pork.

12:49.035 --> 12:52.071
She can see that
negative spark of energy

12:52.105 --> 12:54.674
that just transfers
like wildfire to everyone.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.810
Shanika:
I knew we should've
did damn salmon.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.145
- Nobody wanna listen to me.
I know.
- It's coming.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.615
- Pork is easy to cook
if you know what you're doing.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:01.648 --> 13:05.685
- You don't need to get sassy.
- You're the one
that's getting sassy.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.120
- Bowen: Those are raw.
- They're raw.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.922
( bleep )

13:08.955 --> 13:10.924
Try the--
The smaller ones, Bowen.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.191
Take the smaller ones, Bowen.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.327
We cannot serve raw meat.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.795
This is a hundredth
anniversary.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.531
This isn't
some backyard barbecue.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.699
- It's raw.
- Okay, then grab another one.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.501
Let's go. Come on.

13:21.535 --> 13:22.969
I am 3-0 in team challenges,

13:23.002 --> 13:24.838
and I don't intend
on losing today.

13:24.871 --> 13:27.807
Like, seriously, red team,
we need to get it together.

13:27.841 --> 13:30.143
- Guys, we need steaks now.
- Steaks going in the oven.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.478
Guys, those standards have to be
as high as they can be.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.113
A hundred years, baby.
Let's go.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.649
Gordon: Do you know
if they're cooked or not?

13:35.682 --> 13:38.051
- Gerron, are these cooked?
- Yeah, they are.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.719
- Touch 'em. Those are cooked.
- They were the first batch
that came out.

13:39.753 --> 13:41.788
- Emily approved them.
- Julia: Emily approved them.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.990
- Shanika: Emily approved them.
- Stop. Stop right there.

13:44.023 --> 13:45.959
Blue team, come here.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.695
- Stop. Come here.
- Yes, Chef.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.296
Stop.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.732
Stop right there.

13:52.766 --> 13:55.201
We're in trouble here.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.671
- That is not gonna
get you a vote.
- No.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.472
Captain, you need to be
a little bit more protective.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.907
You can't just,
"They're all cooked!"

14:00.940 --> 14:02.175
Get a grip.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.577
- Yes, Chef.
- Okay, Chef.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.211
- Emily.
- Yes, Chef.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.479
I'm gonna look as stupid as you
if that goes out.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.514
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Okay?

14:14.420 --> 14:17.323
You have no stripes
on your shoulders.
What does that mean?

14:17.356 --> 14:20.927
- That means I'm a cadet.
Air Force academy.
- You're a cadet.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.262
We're on the Air Force parachute
team, The Wings of Blue.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.100
All right, who is gonna
vote for the red team?
Hands in the air.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.002
And blue team?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.937
Thank you very much. Good luck
with your career, guys.

14:30.970 --> 14:34.340
I really loved everything
on my blue plate.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.943
And whatever this chutney is
is delicious.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.612
The pork chop
was cooked perfectly,

14:38.645 --> 14:41.414
but the red team,
the steak was just amazing.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.850
Beautiful steak, medium rare.
Come on!

14:43.883 --> 14:45.752
- Everything well?
No. What's wrong?
- No.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.622
Oh, my God,
it's completely raw.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.590
- Yeah.
- Let me have this, guys.

14:50.624 --> 14:52.458
- Give me a second.
I apologize.
- All right. Thank you.

14:52.491 --> 14:55.895
I need a pan of pork, please.
Pan of pork to the pass.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.231
- Guys, we got a problem.
- What's wrong, Joe, please?

14:58.264 --> 15:00.433
- This pork chop's
completely raw. Like, raw.
- Oh, no. No.

15:00.466 --> 15:01.935
- Like, cold in the middle.
- Oh, no. ( bleep )

15:01.968 --> 15:03.603
Embarrassing.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.138
Emily:
You have got to be
kidding me.

15:05.171 --> 15:07.607
This is not just
a little pink in the middle.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.710
This is like it was kissed
by the grill and then
sent out on a plate.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.212
- Gerron! Ashley!
- Yes, Chef.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.781
- No!
- Come on, guys.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.050
- Don't fall apart now.
Let's go.
- Heard.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.118
Emily:
I'm depending on my team
to be my parachute.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.288
And if they can't execute,
then we're done for.

15:22.321 --> 15:25.692
It's a hundred year anniversary.
Happy birthday.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.105
- Guys, we got a problem.
- What's wrong, Joe?

15:39.138 --> 15:41.574
- Pork chop's
completely raw. Like, raw.
- Oh, no. No.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.476
- Like, cold in the middle.
Embarrassing.
- Oh, no.

15:43.509 --> 15:44.744
Shanika:
Damn it.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.345
- Emily.
- Yes, Chef.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.447
- You're supposed to be
the captain.
- Yes, Chef.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.183
Emily, what kind of
captain are you

15:50.216 --> 15:51.517
if you're not really
doing your job?

15:51.550 --> 15:53.486
If we lose
this challenge right now,

15:53.519 --> 15:55.354
it's gonna be
because of Emily.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.627
How we doing?
How's the red team
and blue team?

16:01.661 --> 16:04.630
- Any problems?
- Yeah, just with the--
the red team.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.299
There's actually a hair
in my dish.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.969
Where? Oh, my God.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.672
You have a hair.
It's in the asparagus.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.273
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.542
- Is that yours?
- No, it's not my hair.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.512
- 'Cause it's not mine.
It's not yours.
- Right. Right.

16:19.545 --> 16:22.949
All right, I'm gonna go back
and see if they have an
explanation for this.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.951
- Gordon: Red team.
- Red team: Yes, Chef.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.552
Just under 20 guests left,
guys, yeah?

16:26.585 --> 16:29.122
- Yes, Chef.
- Quality, right?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.724
- Guys, guys, guys.
Gordon, we have a problem.
- What's wrong?

16:30.757 --> 16:32.391
Oh, jeez. Come on.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.628
- Oh, Lord.
- Embarrassing.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.363
Taylor:
It's either me or Julia.

16:37.396 --> 16:38.832
And I'm like, "( bleep )!"

16:38.865 --> 16:42.235
Please get
a ( bleep ) grip, now.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.137
Okay, Chef.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.172
Julia:
Guys, we need more steaks!
Come on!

16:46.205 --> 16:49.709
- Samantha: I'm on it.
- Julia: Come on, guys.

16:49.743 --> 16:51.544
Gordon:
Ladies and gentlemen, could
you please cast your votes.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.179
Thank you.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.481
I'm definitely going to be
voting for the red team.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.184
The steak was just cooked
wonderfully.

16:58.217 --> 17:00.987
I really loved everything
on my blue plate.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.555
They did a really good job.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.257
Gerron: Check those.
Just make sure
they're done.

17:04.290 --> 17:05.558
- I poked the middle.
- Yep.

17:05.591 --> 17:06.826
They are cooked.
Thank you, Gerron.

17:06.860 --> 17:08.094
No problem, Chef.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.595
I'm gonna have to go
with the red team.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.597
I thought the hanger steak
was cooked great.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.400
There's a good char.
I thought it was a great dish.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.335
Gordon:
Your last plate, red team.
Come on.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.437
- Thank you for waiting.
- Well done. Clear up.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.006
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you, Chef.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.875
Cesar: Besides the hair,
I'm confident

17:21.908 --> 17:24.710
that the flavors
that we presented today

17:24.744 --> 17:27.781
will win us at least
that one deciding vote.

17:27.814 --> 17:31.017
The blue team's pork is
a lot more flavorful
than the red team's steak.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.551
Definitely.
The blue team is really good.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.391
Well done.
What screwed it for you all

17:38.424 --> 17:40.193
is the control of the pork.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.696
But the most important thing is
a hundred got served. Okay?

17:43.729 --> 17:45.799
- Clear down.
- All: Yes, Chef.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.767
Emily:
We fell apart
a little bit at the end,

17:47.801 --> 17:51.604
but we only had one pork chop
that came back very rare,

17:51.637 --> 17:55.141
um, which I think when cooking
pork is almost a miracle.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.076
I told y'all
we shoulda used damn salmon.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.212
- No, nobody wanna do salmon.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.147
That was not the issue.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.982
I mean, stay positive,
think on the positive side.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.418
I'm trying to stay positive,
but you know why we messed up.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.987
- Uh--
- Out of all of those
pork chops that was cooked,

18:08.021 --> 18:09.388
one came back raw.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.657
- Gerron and Emily: One.
- You got a point.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.827
- I'm going for the blue.
- Red.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.394
- Blue.
- Red.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.130
All right, it looks like
we're a table divided.

18:17.163 --> 18:18.464
It's gonna be pretty
interesting.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.903
- Right. Thank you.
- ( cheers and applause )

18:23.937 --> 18:25.304
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:25.338 --> 18:29.108
we hope you all enjoyed
a delicious lunch.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.577
And a special thank you
to all the airmen

18:31.610 --> 18:33.279
that dedicate your lives
on a daily basis

18:33.312 --> 18:36.582
to keeping us and this
incredible country safe.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.751
Thank you all so much.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.355
- ( applause )
- Thank you so much.

18:42.388 --> 18:45.859
So, both teams fought hard
to serve their best today,

18:45.892 --> 18:48.661
but ultimately one of these
teams will be safe

18:48.694 --> 18:52.031
and the other will go into
the dreaded pressure test.

18:53.399 --> 18:56.569
It looks like
the results are in.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.542
Wherever he lands,

19:03.576 --> 19:06.880
that will confirm
today's winner.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.448
Oh, my God.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.017
This is intense.

19:14.087 --> 19:16.555
The winning team
to help celebrate

19:16.589 --> 19:19.926
the hundredth
anniversary is...

19:24.530 --> 19:26.499
...the blue team!

19:26.532 --> 19:28.701
( cheering )

19:28.734 --> 19:30.203
Gordon: Wow.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.074
We freakin' pulled it off.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.876
All right, Emily,
I ain't mad no more.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.011
Whoo! We did it.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.215
But wait a minute.

19:42.248 --> 19:45.218
There is one more parachute
in the air.

19:45.251 --> 19:47.653
- What?
- Oh, man.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.488
What?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.057
Another skydiver?

19:51.090 --> 19:53.392
Where in the hell
does he think he's going?

19:53.426 --> 19:57.030
He is landing on...

19:57.063 --> 19:59.265
Oh, I can't watch.

19:59.298 --> 20:01.067
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.772
- Gordon: On red!
- ( cheers and applause )

20:08.074 --> 20:09.075
Cesar: Whoa, we got a tie!

20:09.108 --> 20:10.944
Oh, my God.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.946
Gordon:
That is extraordinary.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.547
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:14.580 --> 20:16.916
that means
for the first time ever

20:16.950 --> 20:19.085
in the history
of "MasterChef",

20:19.118 --> 20:21.087
we have a tie!

20:21.120 --> 20:24.123
- Oh, my Lord.
- ( cheers and applause )

20:25.658 --> 20:27.626
Gordon:
Wow. Wow!

20:27.660 --> 20:29.095
Emily:
It's a tie.

20:29.128 --> 20:30.529
What do we even do now?

20:30.563 --> 20:33.766
That means us, as judges,

20:33.799 --> 20:35.768
will need to break this tie...

20:39.338 --> 20:41.540
...tomorrow morning,
0800 sharp,

20:41.574 --> 20:43.376
back in
the MasterChef kitchen.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.777
Incredible. Ladies
and gentlemen,

20:44.810 --> 20:46.479
give them a round
of applause, please.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.814
That is extraordinary.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.549
Never in the history
of "MasterChef"

20:50.583 --> 20:52.785
have we ever had a tie.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.654
Cesar:
The battle may be over,

20:55.688 --> 20:58.257
but the war is definitely gonna
continue between blue and red

20:58.291 --> 21:00.960
once we step back
into the MasterChef kitchen.

21:00.994 --> 21:03.196
Who would've thought that?
Amazing.

21:16.175 --> 21:18.311
Line up, please.
Welcome back.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.612
Emily:
It's a tie.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.347
First time ever
in "MasterChef" history.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.316
The blue team
started off strong

21:23.349 --> 21:25.451
and our communication
was on point.

21:25.484 --> 21:26.819
At least four
out of five of us

21:26.852 --> 21:28.621
had a common goal
and a common vision,

21:28.654 --> 21:30.123
but I think Shanika

21:30.156 --> 21:31.524
is really weighing us down
at this point.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.526
So, however
this is gonna pan out,

21:33.559 --> 21:35.628
I hope that she goes home
as soon as possible.

21:35.661 --> 21:39.098
All 10 of you made
"MasterChef" history

21:39.132 --> 21:41.967
with our first ever tie.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.203
Unfortunately,
it is our duty

21:44.237 --> 21:46.972
to decide a winning team
and a losing team.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.008
The losing team will face
the pressure test.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.943
Oh, my God.

21:50.976 --> 21:55.081
After which at least one
of you ten will go home.

21:56.249 --> 21:59.952
Now, we do have
a winning team.

21:59.985 --> 22:04.157
And that team is,
by the narrowest of margins,

22:04.190 --> 22:06.992
the... red team.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.028
- ( sighs )
- Oh, my God.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.797
Yes, it was a 50-50 draw,

22:11.830 --> 22:15.301
but based on the feedback
and discussing every vote,

22:15.334 --> 22:17.236
it was a more
comprehensive dish

22:17.270 --> 22:18.971
and it was better received.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.673
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

22:20.706 --> 22:22.975
- Head up to
the balcony, please.
- Thank you.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.678
- Congrats, guys.
- Congrats, y'all.

22:25.711 --> 22:28.481
So, blue team, please put on

22:28.514 --> 22:31.517
those black pressure test aprons
that are behind you.

22:31.550 --> 22:32.551
When you lose,
it kind of sucks.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.153
But at the end of the day,

22:34.187 --> 22:36.155
I'm not kissing
nobody's behind to be safe.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.856
If something is wrong,

22:37.890 --> 22:40.159
I'm gonna say how I feel,
and that is it.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.361
So whatever's gonna happen today
is gonna happen.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.996
Joe: For your
pressure test tonight,

22:44.029 --> 22:47.766
you'll be making something
very difficult--

22:47.800 --> 22:52.705
an extremely technical,
multilayered culinary classic.

22:52.738 --> 22:55.408
The infamous...

22:55.441 --> 22:57.910
Black Forest cake.

22:57.943 --> 23:00.846
- Voila.
- Wow.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.548
- Whoa.
- I am not scared of baking.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.417
It might be
a Black Forest cake.

23:04.450 --> 23:07.019
I may never have made or eaten
a Black Forest cake before,

23:07.052 --> 23:08.921
but baking is my wheelhouse.

23:08.954 --> 23:12.091
Shanika and everyone else
down here in the kitchen

23:12.125 --> 23:14.227
should be scared as hell
because they know

23:14.260 --> 23:15.628
that my Black Forest cake

23:15.661 --> 23:17.963
is going to one of the best,
if not the best.

23:17.996 --> 23:21.767
Tonight, we are looking
for a perfect replication

23:21.800 --> 23:24.437
of this masterpiece
in front of me.

23:24.470 --> 23:27.873
We wanna see
the four incredible,

23:27.906 --> 23:32.044
- light, fluffy layers...
- Nice.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.581
...evenly cooked, and more
importantly, evenly frosted.

23:35.614 --> 23:39.252
And then that beautiful sour,
sweet cherry mouthful

23:39.285 --> 23:41.720
has to be had
across every bite.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.056
From a patisserie
point of view,

23:44.089 --> 23:48.327
it takes not months,
but years to master.

23:48.361 --> 23:50.563
It's an architectural
nightmare.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.165
Get this wrong
at the beginning,

23:52.198 --> 23:54.267
this whole thing
could collapse.

23:54.300 --> 23:57.570
All right, guys,
before you all start baking

23:57.603 --> 24:00.139
- there's just one more thing.
- ( sighs )

24:00.173 --> 24:03.176
Emily, you have a very
important decision to make.

24:03.209 --> 24:06.845
This is gonna be
the single biggest decision

24:06.879 --> 24:09.615
that you have made
in this kitchen.

24:09.648 --> 24:13.619
You can either now pick
one person from your team

24:13.652 --> 24:17.590
to go up against head-to-head
in this challenge,

24:17.623 --> 24:21.760
and for that,
you would be saving

24:21.794 --> 24:24.963
three other home cooks.

24:24.997 --> 24:30.503
Or you can save just yourself.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.205
Whoa.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.507
I know what it's like
to be safe up
on the balcony,

24:34.540 --> 24:36.775
and that's the best feeling
on the face of the planet.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.777
But on the flipside,
I also have skills

24:38.811 --> 24:42.481
that I think could be beneficial
in this pressure test.

24:42.515 --> 24:44.350
Unless something
catastrophic happens,

24:44.383 --> 24:47.486
I could make a fantastic
Black Forest cake.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.789
I'm gonna choose
to go head-to-head.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.559
- Wow!
- Wow.

24:53.592 --> 24:56.629
I am a believer
in positive communication,

24:56.662 --> 24:58.731
and respecting people
in the kitchen.

24:58.764 --> 25:02.134
So, I will have to say
go head-to-head with Shanika.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.970
- I'm ready.
- I'm sorry, Joe.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.241
- We're both on your team.
- I'm losing on
every front here.

25:08.274 --> 25:11.710
Ashley, Farhan, Gerron, get up
to the safety of the balcony.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.847
Shanika:
Okay, Emily,
I'm not the best baker,

25:14.880 --> 25:17.416
but I know that I'm strong
and I'm determined.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.818
You wanna battle it out?
Let's fight.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.153
This is it.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.690
The baking battle
of the century.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.593
At your stations, you'll have
everything that you need

25:27.626 --> 25:30.496
to make a perfect
Black Forest cake.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.198
And you'll have just
75 minutes to make it happen.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.100
Both of you, please,
head to your stations.

25:35.133 --> 25:37.436
Shanika:
Emily is the strongest baker.

25:37.470 --> 25:39.204
This is like
David and Goliath.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.839
I don't know
how I'm gonna do this,

25:40.873 --> 25:43.542
other than me staying focused,
but I am not going home.

25:43.576 --> 25:46.078
We're gonna battle this out
to the bitter end,

25:46.111 --> 25:47.680
and the best cake shall win.

25:47.713 --> 25:52.251
Your 75 minutes start now.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.587
- Come on, guys.
- Let's go!

25:54.620 --> 25:56.622
Come on, y'all.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.957
We need vanilla in the batter,
milk in the batter.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.693
Where are my eggs?

26:00.726 --> 26:03.462
Guys, we're witnessing
the biggest baking battle

26:03.496 --> 26:05.431
- in history
of this competition.
- ( sighs )

26:05.464 --> 26:08.701
- Teaspoon.
- I really believe
that Emily could win

26:08.734 --> 26:10.403
this whole thing,
and I might lose her.

26:10.436 --> 26:11.804
And then
she doubled downed on me

26:11.837 --> 26:14.106
by choosing to
go against another

26:14.139 --> 26:16.241
one of my team members,
Shanika.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.644
So, I will lose
one apron today.

26:18.677 --> 26:20.245
Guys, I love Black Forest cake.
How do you make it?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.548
For me, it's all
about that sponge.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.317
- So first off,
you gotta whip that butter.
- All right.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.319
Add the eggs,
and then incorporate the sugar,

26:26.352 --> 26:28.253
- and then the cocoa powder.
- All right.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.725
The most important part
is the equal measures

26:32.758 --> 26:34.159
of sponge
you put in those tins.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.829
A millimeter higher-lower,

26:36.862 --> 26:39.064
then you have already
an uneven cake layer.

26:39.097 --> 26:42.435
Big difference-- Emily weighed
out the batter in each one,

26:42.468 --> 26:44.970
- and Shanika's doing it by eye.
- Let's go, Shanika.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.005
Get that cake
in the oven.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.774
Emily's in the oven,
and under ten minutes.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.409
- That's incredible.
- All right.

26:50.443 --> 26:52.678
Oh, man. Shanika,
confident you can nail this?

26:52.711 --> 26:55.247
Um, I'm feeling good.
I mean, it is what it is.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.483
I guess that's what you get
for being opinionated
and speaking your mind.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.652
- Ever made
a Black Forest cake before?
- Nope.

26:59.685 --> 27:02.254
- I'm allergic to chocolate.
- You're allergic to chocolate?

27:02.287 --> 27:03.789
- Yep.
- Wow. But you're a fighter.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.258
I never back down
from a fight.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.126
Now if you were captain,
who would you have chosen
to go head-to-head with?

27:08.160 --> 27:09.528
I probably would've
did the same thing.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.530
She's just a nasty girl.

27:11.564 --> 27:12.965
You've got 60 minutes
to nail this.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.767
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.369
- Come on, Shanika.
- Emily.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.637
- Yes, sir.
- I'm slightly disappointed

27:18.671 --> 27:20.639
to see you here right now.
What are you thinking?

27:20.673 --> 27:22.608
I think Shanika has maybe
overstayed her welcome.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.843
- Oh.
- Ha! Overstayed
my damn welcome.

27:24.877 --> 27:27.145
Girl, it's going down tonight.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.515
- So it's a personal thing?
- It's personal
and professional.

27:29.548 --> 27:32.017
In professional,
she was not in the challenge,

27:32.050 --> 27:34.953
- and this is the punishment.
- She's gonna be her own demise.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.723
So is everything going to plan?
No variables so far?

27:37.756 --> 27:39.291
My variable was putting
a little extra cocoa powder

27:39.324 --> 27:40.659
- into my cake batter.
- I saw that.

27:40.693 --> 27:42.227
It certainly takes
a lot of confidence

27:42.260 --> 27:43.496
with all the chips
on the table...

27:43.529 --> 27:45.364
- Mm-hmm.
- ...to double down

27:45.398 --> 27:47.199
by varying a classic recipe,
but, you know, it could work.

27:47.232 --> 27:49.635
- Better pull it through.
- Hopefully I do.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.970
Gordon:
45 minutes to go, guys.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.839
Let's go.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.041
- Top dog versus underdog.
- You're in for a shock.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.477
Shanika is allergic
to chocolate.

27:58.511 --> 28:01.647
- What?
- She cannot taste chocolate.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.881
Shanika has dropped
the bombshell.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.183
- Hope I have enough.
- Oh, man.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.820
Emily has gone
double down,

28:07.853 --> 28:09.988
and she's making the cocoa
percentage much higher

28:10.022 --> 28:11.524
in the sponge cake,
so it's risky.

28:11.557 --> 28:14.092
- Right on schedule.
- Once the sponge is made,

28:14.126 --> 28:15.594
you then start
with your frosting.

28:15.628 --> 28:18.030
I did not add
my vanilla extract.

28:18.063 --> 28:19.698
I gotta put
that back in there.

28:19.732 --> 28:22.200
You need that lovely frosting
to be not too buttery,

28:22.234 --> 28:24.537
and sweet enough against
the sourness of the cherries.

28:24.570 --> 28:26.739
And then you start thinking
about the chopping
of the cherries,

28:26.772 --> 28:28.707
incorporating that
through the frosting,

28:28.741 --> 28:30.108
and making sure
there's no ragged edges.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.845
Anything ragged
in the middle of that layer,

28:32.878 --> 28:34.847
you're gonna
rip and tear that cake

28:34.880 --> 28:36.749
the minute
you start slicing it.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.551
I don't think she cooled down
her cake enough.

28:38.584 --> 28:42.220
Do not try to put cream
or layer any kind of cake

28:42.254 --> 28:43.556
if that cake is even warm.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.424
( sighs )
Oh, my God.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.359
Emily's looks too tall, guys.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.894
It's looking like
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.

28:48.927 --> 28:50.463
Julia:
Hers looks like it's leaning.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.598
What I don't want to do

28:52.631 --> 28:55.133
is to put
this cream on this cake

28:55.167 --> 28:56.301
and it is not ready for it.

28:56.334 --> 28:58.036
( sighs )

28:58.070 --> 29:00.906
Because this cake will
collapse if it's too hot--

29:00.939 --> 29:04.042
- from the cream.
- 20 minutes remaining.

29:04.076 --> 29:06.712
Aarón:
So, Shanika is up
to her third layer.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.415
Her cake is smaller
than Emily's.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.319
You have-- oh, my God.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.088
Farhan: ( whispers )
Oh, no, her cake fell over.

29:16.121 --> 29:20.392
All you see is this cream
smeared on the side of the door.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.127
This is catastrophic.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.730
I don't know if there's any
bouncing back from this.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.766
- You okay?
- Uh, no.

29:36.308 --> 29:39.144
You have-- oh, my God.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.980
Farhan: ( whispers )
Oh, no, her cake fell over.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.349
- You okay?
- Uh, no.

29:44.382 --> 29:45.518
- What happened?
- The cake was fine

29:45.551 --> 29:47.452
when I put it
in the blast chiller.

29:47.486 --> 29:49.522
Unfortunately,
it's not fine taking it out
of the blast chiller,

29:49.555 --> 29:51.524
and it toppled over.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.960
- Um-- Yep.
- Well, you still got 15 minutes
to go to change it.

29:54.993 --> 29:57.295
This could literally not have
happened at a worse time.

29:57.329 --> 29:59.832
There's no time
to re-bake my cake.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.433
There's no time
to reconstruct it.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.801
Shanika:
It was too hot, girl.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.102
You took it out too fast.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.671
Everything has fallen apart.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.305
Not only my cake,

30:07.339 --> 30:09.041
but my entire plan
to send Shanika home.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.910
Julia:
They were too warm.

30:14.580 --> 30:15.848
( sighs )
Oh, my God.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.783
- ( sighs )
- What went on there?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.018
Emily's cake had fallen over
in the blast chiller.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.154
Ugh, come on, man.

30:22.187 --> 30:26.191
Emily's cake is so tall,
and the blast chiller could
actually blow it over

30:26.224 --> 30:28.861
- Mm.
- if that sponge is not cold.
This is a nightmare.

30:28.894 --> 30:32.531
( sighs )
There is almost no way
to come back from that.

30:32.565 --> 30:35.500
Gordon:
Five minutes to go.

30:35.534 --> 30:39.371
You've got to start looking
at the finishing touches.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.874
I'm just trying
to get these sides even.

30:41.907 --> 30:43.375
Come on, Shanika,
start decorating.

30:43.408 --> 30:44.743
Get it on that glass.

30:44.777 --> 30:46.311
All right,
decorating it shall be.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.747
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you, Bowen.

30:48.781 --> 30:51.149
Gordon:
Last three minutes!
Chocolate on there,

30:51.183 --> 30:53.085
every little shard you've got,

30:53.118 --> 30:54.653
and make them look incredible.

30:54.687 --> 30:56.922
- Come on.
- Okay, Chef, gotcha.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.256
- Come on, ladies.
You've got this.
- Oh, my God.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.258
Aarón:
There you go. Come on, Emily.

31:00.292 --> 31:03.195
Last minute!
Come on, please, let's go.

31:03.228 --> 31:04.897
- Finishing touches.
- Let's go, Shanika.

31:04.930 --> 31:07.866
It might not be the perfect one,
but I shall try.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.369
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight,

31:11.403 --> 31:13.906
- seven, six, five...
- Oh, my God.

31:13.939 --> 31:17.442
...four, three, two, one.

31:17.475 --> 31:19.912
- Gordon:
And stop! Well done.
- Well done.

31:19.945 --> 31:22.748
Joe:
Wow! That was intense.

31:22.781 --> 31:25.383
Now, both of you bring
your cakes

31:25.417 --> 31:26.919
down to front bench.
Thank you.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.955
My cake was in pieces
ten minutes ago,

31:29.988 --> 31:31.690
and I have reassembled this

31:31.724 --> 31:34.793
into something resembling
a Black Forest cake.

31:34.827 --> 31:36.394
It's by no means my best work,

31:36.428 --> 31:38.396
but I know
it's good enough to stay.

31:38.430 --> 31:42.300
Two home cooks,
both wearing my aprons,

31:42.334 --> 31:44.269
and one of you will
be going home tonight.

31:44.302 --> 31:46.471
Let's see how you did.

31:50.743 --> 31:53.545
Okay, Emily, tell me
what happened.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.980
( laughs )
My cake fell over.

31:55.013 --> 31:58.216
- Wow!
- I think I recovered nicely,

31:58.250 --> 32:00.719
- but disaster struck today.
- You built it high.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.088
It's considerably higher
than Shanika's. Why is that?

32:03.121 --> 32:04.489
Perhaps because
the depth of my cake layers,

32:04.522 --> 32:07.059
but also because I made sure
to have a nice layer

32:07.092 --> 32:09.061
of whipped cream in between
all four of my layers.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.796
Apart from it falling over,

32:10.829 --> 32:12.164
is there anything else you
would've done differently?

32:12.197 --> 32:13.431
Nothing that I would've
done differently,

32:13.465 --> 32:15.567
but something
that I did do differently,

32:15.600 --> 32:18.637
mine has just a touch
more cocoa powder
in the cake itself

32:18.671 --> 32:20.806
just to give it
a little bit more richness

32:20.839 --> 32:22.908
and balance out the lightness
of the whipped cream.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.911
The question is really, like,
what the layers are like.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.947
How's that look?

32:28.981 --> 32:31.249
- Not as great
as it could look.
- No.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.185
What happened to the layers
of whipped cream?

32:33.218 --> 32:35.420
They compressed.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.289
So this is like a rich,
chocolate sponge cake?

32:37.322 --> 32:39.024
The cherries themselves,
did you do anything to them?

32:39.057 --> 32:41.860
I quartered the cherries
for the filling on the inside.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.964
The sponge, um...

32:45.998 --> 32:48.667
is very, very moist,
and has a very assertive

32:48.701 --> 32:51.536
chocolate flavor,
which I like.

32:51.569 --> 32:53.872
The extra chocolate paid off.
Cherries are good.

32:53.906 --> 32:56.308
Nice and crunchy.
You can taste the alcohol.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.176
It's too bad we don't have
more cream in between.

32:58.210 --> 33:01.980
The amount of cake to cream--
the ratio's way off.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.049
- Mm-hmm.
- That's where I'm having
a bit of trouble here.

33:04.082 --> 33:06.351
Thank you.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.856
Emily, you're happy
with the flavor
of the cake itself?

33:10.889 --> 33:13.792
All of the different elements
jiving well together?

33:13.826 --> 33:15.694
I am. I think
the richness of the cake

33:15.728 --> 33:17.295
is cut by the lightness
of the whipped cream

33:17.329 --> 33:19.497
and the tartness
of the cherries.

33:23.501 --> 33:27.505
Um, I think the construction
of the cake suffered

33:27.539 --> 33:29.708
by many different variables.

33:29.742 --> 33:32.344
I just want more cherry flavor,
I think, 'cause it's so dense.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.913
If I had it my way,
I would've taken
those cherries

33:34.947 --> 33:37.315
and put 'em
in the food processor
and made a paste.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.152
And then I would've
spread the paste
on each layer evenly

33:40.185 --> 33:42.420
'cause then I would've got
just little pops of cherry.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.224
But what I do love,
I love the additional
cocoa powder.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.693
I think it's necessary.
I think you have
a lot of richness

33:48.727 --> 33:51.730
'cause your chantilly cream
is so deep and rich.

33:51.764 --> 33:54.699
And I think that small change
made a big difference

33:54.733 --> 33:56.268
in the overall flavor
of the cake.

33:56.301 --> 34:00.005
And that's what I find
the most memorable.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.506
Shanika:
Emily's cake wasn't perfect,

34:01.539 --> 34:03.341
but at the end of the day,

34:03.375 --> 34:06.178
it's all gonna come down to what
my cake looks like inside.

34:06.211 --> 34:07.746
I'm hoping
that my layers are there.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.014
I'm hoping
that everything is even.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.283
Oh, MasterChef gods,
help me out.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.218
Okay, Shanika.

34:13.251 --> 34:16.021
Well done.
Tough 75 minutes.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.256
- How are you feeling?
- Relieved that it's over,

34:18.290 --> 34:20.425
and just ready for judgment.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.194
Something fascinating
happened.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.930
Emily's weighing out her tins
to the absolute gram,

34:24.963 --> 34:26.564
and you're just
putting it in with the eye.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.034
You weighed nothing out, why?

34:29.067 --> 34:32.404
- I just went by scoop
and just on hopes that--
- By scoop.

34:32.437 --> 34:35.707
- ( clicks tongue )
- We need four
immaculate layers...

34:35.740 --> 34:38.743
- Absolutely right.
- ...in order to build
this cake beautifully,

34:38.777 --> 34:40.745
and start off
with a consistent base.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.547
So without weighing
any of your mixture,

34:42.580 --> 34:44.282
how'd you know
it's evenly layered?

34:44.316 --> 34:46.218
I'm just hoping
for the best right now.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.920
Let's get in there.

34:47.953 --> 34:50.222
I love the little shards
of chocolate on top.

34:50.255 --> 34:54.292
Knife is smoothly
going through. It's light.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.829
And here we are.
Let's have a look.

35:02.267 --> 35:04.469
- ( gasps )
- Wow.

35:11.944 --> 35:14.512
And here we are.
Let's have a look.

35:15.780 --> 35:17.916
( gasps )

35:17.950 --> 35:20.285
Wow. Look at that.

35:20.318 --> 35:21.753
That is beautiful.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.288
( sighs )

35:25.190 --> 35:26.658
That's beautiful.

35:26.691 --> 35:28.593
Emily, what do you think?

35:28.626 --> 35:29.928
I think she's got
whipped cream

35:29.962 --> 35:31.864
in between each
of her layers of cake.

35:39.671 --> 35:41.974
Um...

35:42.007 --> 35:44.642
...it's delicious.
It really is delicious.

35:44.676 --> 35:47.545
It's rich,
it's nicely soaked.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.714
Visually you can see
the four layers,

35:49.747 --> 35:52.317
but cherries
a little bit too big.

35:52.350 --> 35:54.219
- So it's a little bit chunky.
- Okay.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.988
So when we cut through them,
it tears.

35:56.021 --> 35:58.190
- But well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.692
Thank you.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.962
So, Emily, "JB" on your pin.

36:03.996 --> 36:05.530
Shanika, "JB" on your pin.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.832
This is, like, an epic moment.

36:07.866 --> 36:10.368
It's like when Venus
and Serena play,

36:10.402 --> 36:12.871
- who does the dad root for?
- ( laughter )

36:15.073 --> 36:16.508
- That's a good question.
- That is a good one.

36:16.541 --> 36:19.011
That's the position
I find myself in.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.150
So, clearly you have layers
with cherries in them.

36:25.183 --> 36:28.086
- Yes.
- Now, the construction
of this cake allows me...

36:28.120 --> 36:30.923
- ( chuckles )
- ...to enjoy it in
a more traditional way,

36:30.956 --> 36:33.491
where I can just kinda
take a bite and it should
have everything.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.927
Shanika:
It should.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.032
The sponge cake is good.
It's light.

36:40.065 --> 36:43.101
Very flavorful.
Chantilly cream, very good.

36:43.135 --> 36:45.737
But a Black Forest cake needs
to be a juicy cake.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.505
- Mm-hmm.
- I like your cake.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.507
All the elements
of it are good,

36:49.541 --> 36:51.944
but it tastes like
a chocolate pound cake
with chantilly cream

36:51.977 --> 36:53.745
and a couple of cherries in it.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.181
For me, it's not really
saying Black Forest.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.882
Okay.

36:59.317 --> 37:00.752
Ugh.

37:00.785 --> 37:02.120
Emily, Shanika,

37:02.154 --> 37:04.556
please come around
to the front. Thank you.

37:04.589 --> 37:06.424
Honestly, Shanika is
the one that deserves
to go home tonight.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.260
Maybe she got
her layers correct,

37:08.293 --> 37:10.695
but at the end of the day,
my flavors are more on point,

37:10.728 --> 37:13.098
and I'm hoping
that gets me through.

37:13.131 --> 37:15.934
Ladies, quite possibly
the most difficult,

37:15.968 --> 37:20.772
the most stressful 75 minutes
of all of your culinary lives.

37:20.805 --> 37:22.540
Emily, well done.
Shanika, well done.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.410
You've left us
with very little room

37:25.443 --> 37:28.780
to decide on
who is leaving shortly.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.416
Right now,
Joe, Aarón, and myself

37:31.449 --> 37:33.918
are in desperate need
of a very serious discussion.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.454
Please, excuse us for a moment.
Thank you.

37:39.324 --> 37:42.327
So, uh,
this is a tough one.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.795
We have to dissect
each element.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.930
Emily's first.
Great tasting sponge.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.932
Yeah, but visually,
it didn't come together.

37:47.966 --> 37:51.003
She took some liberties
as far as adding some
more cocoa powder.

37:51.036 --> 37:55.240
On the other hand,
Shanika had a more traditional
composition of the cake,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.076
that looked and tasted more

37:58.110 --> 37:59.744
like what we presented
for them to replicate.

37:59.777 --> 38:01.913
I don't agree. I think
it may have looked like it,

38:01.946 --> 38:03.415
it didn't taste more like it.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.117
Shanika's sponge
is a lot lighter,

38:05.150 --> 38:08.753
but Emily's cream--
delicious at the top,

38:08.786 --> 38:10.255
but you had
to search for it.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.623
But if you put it
together on your fork

38:11.656 --> 38:13.458
with the right ratio,
it's delicious.

38:13.491 --> 38:15.793
Yeah, it's a tale
of two cakes.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.629
- I think we know
what we need to do.
- Yes.

38:17.662 --> 38:19.064
Let's go.

38:27.039 --> 38:31.609
Emily, Shanika, this decision
is down to the wire.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.545
Two extraordinary
performances,

38:33.578 --> 38:36.548
and only one person
is staying,

38:36.581 --> 38:39.284
and the other is heading home.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.186
It's been hard enough,

38:41.219 --> 38:44.656
so I'm gonna cut straight
to the chase.

38:44.689 --> 38:50.128
The person leaving
the MasterChef kitchen

38:50.162 --> 38:51.163
is...

38:55.100 --> 38:57.202
...Emily.

38:59.704 --> 39:01.806
- ( exhales )
- Gordon: Oh, dear.

39:01.839 --> 39:04.042
- Shanika, congratulations.
- Thank you, Chef.

39:04.076 --> 39:06.911
Please, head up
to the balcony. Thank you.

39:08.213 --> 39:11.049
This feels unreal right now,

39:11.083 --> 39:13.351
but I am taking my butt up
onto that balcony.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.088
I believed I can do it,
and I did it,

39:16.121 --> 39:19.424
but I know everybody up there
are in disbelief right now.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.993
David has beat Goliath.

39:22.026 --> 39:26.098
Oh, this feels so good.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.066
Emily,
I don't know what to say.

39:28.100 --> 39:32.204
I am losing one
of my home cooks,

39:32.237 --> 39:35.107
and I thought you could've
won the whole thing.

39:38.943 --> 39:40.845
The great words
of Winston Churchill,

39:40.878 --> 39:45.550
"Success is not permanent,
and failure is not fatal.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.452
It's the courage to continue."

39:47.485 --> 39:50.088
And I think you have
the courage to continue.

39:50.122 --> 39:51.523
Absolutely.

39:51.556 --> 39:54.292
Unfortunately,
I have to say it,

39:54.326 --> 39:58.396
Emily, your time is done
in the MasterChef kitchen.

39:58.430 --> 40:00.432
Come here
and say good-bye.

40:01.766 --> 40:03.235
Thank you.

40:03.268 --> 40:04.602
Good luck.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.707
Oh, man.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.943
This is one question
I never thought I was
going to be asking you.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.745
Up there,
you know them inside out.

40:13.778 --> 40:17.081
Who do you think is gonna become
America's next MasterChef?

40:17.115 --> 40:22.720
My money is on Ashley
or Farhan, I think.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.656
Oh, lady,
you've been amazing.

40:27.692 --> 40:31.163
Oh, Emily, please,
place your apron
on top of your bench.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.198
Thank you, my darling.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.169
- Gerron: Love you, Ems.
- Love you, Emily.

40:37.202 --> 40:40.605
Emily:
Unfortunately,
today is my day to go home.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.841
But coming from small-town
Neenah, Wisconsin,

40:43.875 --> 40:46.811
all the way to the top ten
of "MasterChef" was a dream,

40:46.844 --> 40:50.248
and it's something that
I'm gonna hold on to forever.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.983
This whole experience

40:52.016 --> 40:54.286
has only added
to my passion for food.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.787
That's only gonna
continue to grow.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.121
It's like that one
little snowball

40:57.155 --> 40:58.656
that starts the avalanche.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.996
- Narrator: Next time...
- Switch!

41:05.029 --> 41:08.200
- Go, go, go, go!
- ...the race to be
the next MasterChef...

41:08.233 --> 41:10.702
- Whack the garlic!
- ...kicks into high gear...

41:10.735 --> 41:13.805
- Let's go!
- ...in an explosive
tag team challenge.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.473
Don't be scared of the fire!

41:15.507 --> 41:17.842
Have you never cooked
over a ( bleep ) grill?

41:17.875 --> 41:19.444
Who will cross
the finish line?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.145
- Perfect.
- Oh, man. That's hot.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.147
And who will fall short?

41:23.181 --> 41:25.517
- 60 seconds to go!
- They're so burnt.

41:25.550 --> 41:27.785
Ugh, this chicken is raw, Sam.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.621
It's burnt. Oh, my God.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.156
- Get it on the plate!
- Oh, my God.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.658
Is he okay?

41:40.398 --> 41:42.400
You've just taken a bite
out of MasterChef.
