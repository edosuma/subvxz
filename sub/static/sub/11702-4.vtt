00:00.100 --> 00:01.780
Oh, what are you doing this for, Franky?

00:01.859 --> 00:03.900
- Because I need the gear.
- You don't need the gear.

00:04.100 --> 00:05.620
Franky, I got nothin'.

00:05.820 --> 00:08.700
Further breaches of conduct
could result in your dismissal.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.340
Do you understand?

00:10.860 --> 00:12.180
Consider this a final warning.

00:12.580 --> 00:13.620
When do you want the gear?

00:13.700 --> 00:14.940
Soon as possible.

00:15.820 --> 00:17.300
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, okay.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.900
FLETCH: I should never have
started fucking that bitch.

00:19.980 --> 00:23.740
There was some stuff
about him and Meg Jackson.

00:25.700 --> 00:26.740
(GROANS)

00:26.820 --> 00:27.820
Who's bringing it in?

00:28.380 --> 00:29.380
Is it Brayden?

00:31.140 --> 00:32.500
Boomer! Boomer! Boomer!

00:32.580 --> 00:33.580
Oh, shit!

00:34.060 --> 00:35.700
You saved my arse last night.

00:35.980 --> 00:37.740
Can you please give this letter to Brayden?

00:37.820 --> 00:39.980
- It's to say how sorry I am.
- Sure.

00:40.460 --> 00:41.580
This is for Debbie.

00:43.820 --> 00:45.260

Fuck!

02:11.540 --> 02:13.300
- Sleep tight, ladies.
- LIZ: Night night.

02:13.780 --> 02:16.220
- Night night.
- If you say so, Mr. J.

02:19.660 --> 02:21.340
Hey, party time!

02:21.420 --> 02:23.860
No way! Where'd you get
the lunatic soup from?

02:23.940 --> 02:25.460
Have you been brewing again, Boomer?

02:26.020 --> 02:28.460
No, this... This is for Franky
from the girls in G Block, eh?

02:28.540 --> 02:30.020
That's a lot of admiration.

02:30.100 --> 02:32.940
Yeah. Everyone's so stoked you're
getting their stuff through, eh.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.780
Booms, take out a fuckin' ad!

02:35.980 --> 02:36.980
Eh?

02:37.260 --> 02:38.860
No, I just... No, I thought...

02:39.180 --> 02:40.660
- Between us... 
- No, don't. Just shut it.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.380
You know the walls have ears.

02:42.820 --> 02:44.300
Piss off that rocket fuel.

02:46.460 --> 02:49.700
If we're gonna celebrate, do
it with the genuine article.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.180

02:52.740 --> 02:54.700
- Real booze!
- I didn't forget you, Liz.

02:56.020 --> 02:57.060
Your favorite.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.060
I'm on a diet.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.700
BOOMER: To Franky, eh?

03:01.140 --> 03:02.860
- To Franky!
- Yeah, Franky!

03:02.940 --> 03:04.100
You're the bomb, girl.

03:04.660 --> 03:05.660
Shit, we need some music.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.020
Oh. Oh, yeah!

03:08.100 --> 03:09.220
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

03:14.260 --> 03:15.860
How're you getting the gear in?

03:16.100 --> 03:18.180
Who cares? As long as
we're here to enjoy it, eh!

03:18.260 --> 03:19.340
FRANKY: Yeah, that's right, Dor.

03:19.420 --> 03:20.940
Wouldn't lover boy be jealous.

03:23.380 --> 03:25.100
Nah, Booms, nah.

03:25.460 --> 03:26.980
Let me show you how it's done, eh?

03:28.460 --> 03:29.780
I can show you how it's done, okay?

03:31.780 --> 03:32.780
ALL: Oh!

03:34.700 --> 03:35.980
How do you do that?

03:37.340 --> 03:39.380
You've been totally holding out on me.

03:54.860 --> 03:55.940
Aren't you gonna give us a hug?

03:59.620 --> 04:01.340
Shit, they really did a job on you.

04:04.580 --> 04:05.740
How's Carly?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.460
- Panicking.
- (CHUCKLES)

04:07.540 --> 04:09.940
She left everything to
the last minute, as usual.

04:10.580 --> 04:11.820
Thailand, eh?

04:12.220 --> 04:13.620
She's grown up already.

04:14.780 --> 04:16.420
We had a bit of a send
off for her last night.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.459
She said to say goodbye.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.500
No, you tell that little
tart to get her ass in here.

04:20.579 --> 04:21.700
What if something happens to her?

04:21.779 --> 04:22.940
What happened to you?

04:23.540 --> 04:24.780
Where was Jacs' old crew?

04:25.460 --> 04:27.340
The Governor's transferred
them to another unit.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.780
I'm still finding my feet.

04:30.620 --> 04:32.300
Well, you'd better find 'em fast.

04:32.380 --> 04:33.500
Vinnie's looking for blood.

04:36.740 --> 04:38.460
I'm not in the firing line, am I?

04:38.860 --> 04:41.340
Don't worry, Brayden
told him what went down.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.260
Yeah, good.

04:43.340 --> 04:46.540
We're gonna have to cool it with the gear
now that bitch has put the heat on you.

04:47.660 --> 04:49.460
Vinnie's not gonna let this slide.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.140
So you keep your head down.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.700
Someone's coming for her.

04:56.300 --> 04:57.660
You stay away.

05:16.260 --> 05:17.260
Hey, slag!

05:19.020 --> 05:21.540
You haven't forgotten about
our unfinished game, have you?

05:21.620 --> 05:23.660
Why don't you just go back
to playing with yourself?

05:24.140 --> 05:25.620
WILL: All right, that'll do.

05:25.700 --> 05:26.780
Move along, Simmo.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.180
Open it.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.660
(GATE OPENS)

05:56.460 --> 05:58.180
You know, if you only get another 18 months

05:58.260 --> 06:00.460
for aggravated assault you'll be lucky.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.140
You're right, by the way.

06:04.460 --> 06:05.700
He did do it.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.660
Not that it could be
proven in a court of law.

06:10.220 --> 06:13.380
I had the general manager in my
office this morning telling me that...

06:16.140 --> 06:17.580
I wasn't doing so well.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.420
He thinks I should leave you here to rot.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.620
But, of course, that's
entirely up to my discretion.

06:23.220 --> 06:24.940
I don't favor that approach myself.

06:26.340 --> 06:29.060
Besides, I don't think we'll
have a repeat of that behavior.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.180
Unless of course Brayden
Holt is stupid enough

06:32.260 --> 06:33.660
to ever to come back to Wentworth.

06:33.940 --> 06:34.980
Am I right?

06:35.860 --> 06:37.260
- Yeah.
- Good.

06:39.580 --> 06:42.100
Then I think I'll release you
back into general population.

06:44.940 --> 06:45.940
What, now?

06:46.020 --> 06:47.100
Mmm-hmm.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.500
We have a deal, don't we?

06:50.540 --> 06:51.860
You won't try and kill anyone,

06:52.820 --> 06:54.340
you won't cause me any further problem.

06:55.020 --> 06:56.020
Okay.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.420
You know, you're not who you think you are.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.460
But your true nature
will eventually come out.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.300
It will have to.

07:34.820 --> 07:37.060
You fuckin' used me, bitch.

07:37.580 --> 07:39.860
Apologize, my ass. Bullshit!

07:40.180 --> 07:41.660
You planned that from the start.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.420
Yeah.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.100
Sorry to involve you like that.

07:45.180 --> 07:46.620
You put me in the shit with the Holts.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.940
Oh, they'll get over it.

07:48.020 --> 07:49.060
You saved his life.

07:49.140 --> 07:51.020
If it wasn't for the fact
you saved me from Franky...

07:51.100 --> 07:52.340
How is Franky?

07:56.260 --> 07:57.860
Been laying low while
I've been in the slot?

07:59.820 --> 08:00.940
What do you think?

08:01.460 --> 08:04.020
- I'm not scared of that clitty licker.
- Well, you should be.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.660
She won't forget you challenged her.

08:07.380 --> 08:08.380
She'll be coming for you.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.060
She'll have you too, for interfering.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.220
Simmo, I want you to listen to me.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.660
We need to watch each other's backs.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.060
You'd back me against Franky?

08:22.500 --> 08:23.500
No.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.700
Not if you picked a fight with her.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.220
I'm not interested in
being part of any crew.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.540
But if I hear there's danger, then yeah,

08:33.100 --> 08:34.419
I'll give you a heads up.

08:36.820 --> 08:38.100
We need to be mates.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.940
- Need to make it work.
- That's right.

08:43.539 --> 08:44.900
- Yeah.
- Deal?

08:46.620 --> 08:47.620
Yeah.

08:53.740 --> 08:54.740
The Holts have got a hit on you.

09:01.780 --> 09:02.820
Do you know who's doing it?

09:03.740 --> 09:04.780
Could be anyone.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.220
Got a lovely new bunch for you today.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.580
He's a tosser, that bloke.

09:34.620 --> 09:35.660
Out you get.

09:51.460 --> 09:52.460
You're next, darling.

09:52.780 --> 09:54.060
Oh, Jesus.

10:23.860 --> 10:25.460
Straight ahead. Move. Move.

10:27.620 --> 10:28.620
Come on, lucky last.

10:28.700 --> 10:29.860
Fuck off, I can manage.

10:29.940 --> 10:31.180
Yeah, right. Fine.

10:42.540 --> 10:43.980
In the middle of that black square there.

10:46.700 --> 10:49.500
Okay, face me, right, and take the wig off.

10:50.460 --> 10:51.940
Turn around and face me.

10:52.860 --> 10:53.860
Wig off.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.420
Oi, take the wig off, yeah?

10:57.500 --> 10:58.540
For the photo ID.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.700
You've gotta take it off
for the photo ID, okay?

11:01.100 --> 11:04.020
No. Please, sir, don't...

11:04.100 --> 11:06.540
Don't make me come over there
and take it off you, all right?

11:08.060 --> 11:10.100
Okay, I think we can make
an exception in this case.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.300
Right. Well, it's your call.

11:14.980 --> 11:17.100
If the Governor objects, you
can buy a new ID, all right?

11:17.420 --> 11:19.220
- You can pay for that.
- Yes.

11:20.820 --> 11:22.100
- Thank you.
- Right. Look at me.

11:23.700 --> 11:24.700
Okay, ready?

11:24.900 --> 11:26.100
- Hold it there.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.180
Are you cold? Do you want a blanket?

11:55.260 --> 11:56.860
No, no, no. No, no, no.

11:57.540 --> 11:58.540
Don't leave me.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.100
Next of kin?

12:05.460 --> 12:06.620
Next of kin.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.780
Medical, yeah? I'm in admission.

12:16.860 --> 12:18.300
I might need sedation, please.

12:23.420 --> 12:24.420
Okay.

12:25.820 --> 12:28.940
Jessica, I need you to take
some deep breaths, okay?

12:29.540 --> 12:30.660
Need you to try and settle down.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.500
I'm... I'm really scared.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.860
I'm really scared.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.660
I didn't do anything.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.860
Yep, I know.

12:39.940 --> 12:41.300
Please, you've gotta help me.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.700
I can't be in here.

12:42.780 --> 12:43.780
- You need to... 
- Please!

12:43.860 --> 12:44.900
You need to calm down,

12:45.260 --> 12:47.420
otherwise I'll have to
get the doctor, all right?

12:48.540 --> 12:49.740
Let go.

12:51.500 --> 12:52.620
Okay?

13:00.860 --> 13:01.860
Okay.

13:03.380 --> 13:04.380
I'm calm.

13:06.980 --> 13:07.980
It's okay.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.460
Thank you.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.300
I didn't expect there'd
be someone like you here.

13:27.460 --> 13:28.580
Okay.

13:29.740 --> 13:30.940
Next of kin.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.340
Oh, come on, Kat.

13:45.740 --> 13:48.900
- Do you wanna quit stalling?
- I've got a busted leg, for fuck's sake.

13:49.700 --> 13:51.340
- I know my rights.
- Yeah, you know the drill.

13:51.420 --> 13:53.700
The sooner you get it all off,
the sooner we're done with this.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.900
- I'm waiting.
- Oh, fuck off!

14:01.420 --> 14:02.660
Could you go and wait for
her in that room please?

14:02.740 --> 14:04.900
That room there? There? Yep.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.460
Vera.

14:08.540 --> 14:11.060
I'm not strip searching
him, okay? I'm not doing it.

14:12.140 --> 14:15.140
When have you ever strip
searched a female prisoner?

14:18.100 --> 14:20.060
She wouldn't be here
unless she was post-op.

14:20.980 --> 14:22.020
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.180
Good.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.010
Are we going in the garden or what?

14:40.730 --> 14:42.450
Where's Ms. Miles. We're
burning daylight here.

14:44.570 --> 14:45.810
Hey, Bea!

14:46.610 --> 14:47.610
Bea!

14:47.690 --> 14:49.090
- Hey!
- Hello.

14:49.490 --> 14:50.770
How are you, love?

14:50.850 --> 14:52.930
Thought you'd be gone
for at least six weeks.

14:53.010 --> 14:54.410
BEA: Oh, Ferguson cut me some slack.

14:54.490 --> 14:56.490
LIZ: Oh, a lot of slack. People will talk.

14:57.170 --> 14:58.170
Let 'em.

14:58.410 --> 14:59.930
It's not like it's much of a favor, anyway.

15:02.850 --> 15:04.050
Why? What's up?

15:05.210 --> 15:08.290
Come on, spit it out. I can tell
when something's bothering you.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.170
I don't think the Holts are going
to take what I did lying down.

15:17.370 --> 15:18.690
You might have known that, love.

No.

There's a bunch of newbies arriving today.

15:30.450 --> 15:32.010
I'm probably just being paranoid anyway.

15:32.370 --> 15:33.490
How are you?

15:33.570 --> 15:34.890
Haven't run away with Nash yet?

15:34.970 --> 15:36.850
Oh, no, don't mention Nash.

15:36.930 --> 15:39.970

16:03.810 --> 16:05.050
What is that?

16:05.570 --> 16:06.690
What are you?

16:07.490 --> 16:09.050
Are you even a girl?

16:26.370 --> 16:28.370

- Who?

16:29.170 --> 16:30.450

Look at her, she's grinning like an idiot.

He's a greedy little sucker, isn't he?

16:56.530 --> 16:57.530
Yeah.

16:59.330 --> 17:00.770
He's lucky he's got us, eh?

for attempting to bribe an officer?

something for your trouble.

are we talking about?

24:21.770 --> 24:23.050

connections to the Holt family.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.380
No, you were too busy pandering
to the prisoner's needs!

28:23.460 --> 28:24.460
FERGUSON: Mr. Fletcher.

28:25.460 --> 28:27.340
- My office, now.
- Governor, I'm busy, all right?

28:27.420 --> 28:29.780
We have found your
missing meds, Mr. Fletcher.

28:30.020 --> 28:31.580
It was an inventory error.

28:31.660 --> 28:32.660
Follow me.

28:45.700 --> 28:46.860
What the fuck?

29:26.420 --> 29:28.220
Ferguson's being a bit rough on you.

29:28.940 --> 29:31.780
Just for something different, she's
got me mopping out the wet cells.

29:31.980 --> 29:33.100
Yeah.

29:34.700 --> 29:35.780
Thought I could give you a hand.

29:37.460 --> 29:38.460
It's bloody Will.

29:38.620 --> 29:41.100
You know he's dobbed me in with
fuckin' Ferguson again, right?

29:41.620 --> 29:43.020
Do you really think he'd do that?

29:45.820 --> 29:47.820
Well, there's the laundry incident, okay?

29:48.020 --> 29:51.660
The official complaint he made against
me for using capsicum spray on Sky.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.940
The disagreement with me over Kat,

29:54.260 --> 29:55.820
and then he's left me holding
the bag when Simmo and Bea

29:55.900 --> 29:58.100
went missing for the count. I mean, fuck!

29:58.740 --> 30:01.780
Yeah, I just don't think he
would intentionally undermine you.

30:01.860 --> 30:02.980
There might be another explanation.

30:03.220 --> 30:06.700
The explanation is, Vera, he's
got it in for me. That's it, okay?

30:10.140 --> 30:12.740
Now you haven't said anything to
him, have you, about Meg and I?

30:14.220 --> 30:15.220
Of course not.

30:16.540 --> 30:19.940
Because if he knew he'd fuckin' kill me.

30:21.500 --> 30:22.500
All right?

30:29.100 --> 30:30.700
CHRIS: Did you find out who
slashed your tires, mate?

30:47.700 --> 30:49.100
Ah, Jesus!

30:50.860 --> 30:52.500
Hope she was fucking worth it.

31:13.740 --> 31:15.820
- I've got something for you.
- What?

31:18.180 --> 31:19.300
It's a zip gun.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.140
Had it made especially.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.300
How does it work?

31:24.620 --> 31:27.260
Oh, it's pretty basic.
There's a tack inside there.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.340
It's spring loaded.

31:28.700 --> 31:30.260
To fire it, you flick this trigger.

31:31.380 --> 31:33.460
Cap hits the end of the bullet, and bang.

31:33.580 --> 31:34.580
It fires.

31:35.340 --> 31:37.300
But you've gotta get up close and personal.

31:38.540 --> 31:39.980
And there's only one bullet in it,

31:40.620 --> 31:42.620
so you make sure you use
it on the right person.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.020
Thank you.

31:48.020 --> 31:49.780
It's gonna be more than a thanks, Red.

31:55.420 --> 31:56.620
LINDA: Smith.

31:58.020 --> 31:59.180
Keep walking.

31:59.260 --> 32:00.620
I got the info you wanted.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.580
Couldn't find a match between any
of the three newcomers and the Holts.

32:04.940 --> 32:06.940
The tranny's a clean-skin,
in for stabbing her boyfriend.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.420
The junkie tried to hold
up a 7-11 with a syringe.

32:09.980 --> 32:12.380
The girl, assault, although I
couldn't see all of her file.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.300
Some of it was marked
"Governor's eyes only".

32:14.380 --> 32:15.420
What does that mean?

32:16.380 --> 32:17.700
Prior conviction, maybe.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.780
How do I know she's not
connected to the Holts?

32:20.780 --> 32:21.980
I guess you don't.

32:39.620 --> 32:40.700
Hi there.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.660
- You're Maxine, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:45.820 --> 32:46.820
Yeah.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.660
Are you gonna have a shower?

32:49.580 --> 32:50.940
- Yes.
- Cool.

32:52.500 --> 32:53.540
Are you?

32:54.020 --> 32:55.580
Yeah. Yeah.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.060
After you.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.700
Oh, no, no, after you, hmm?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.700
- No... 
- Oh, I insist.

33:10.540 --> 33:11.980
You're not here to shower, are you?

33:13.220 --> 33:14.420
You're just trying to have a look.

33:15.500 --> 33:16.740
So which is it?

33:19.940 --> 33:21.140
Oh, shit, is it both?

33:23.060 --> 33:24.180
Oh, come on.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.060
No, don't be like that.

33:26.140 --> 33:28.380
I got a packet of bickies
riding on this, eh.

34:00.220 --> 34:01.340
Shh!

34:01.940 --> 34:04.060
You're going to keep your voice down, okay?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.500
You're gonna sit up, right?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.380
And you're going to answer my questions,

34:10.460 --> 34:12.340
or I'm going to put a bullet in your brain.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.699
Did the Holts send you?

34:18.900 --> 34:20.860
What? I don't know who the Holts are...

34:20.940 --> 34:21.980
Don't lie to me.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.500
What's in your file that's so secret?

34:26.260 --> 34:27.460
Hmm? What?

34:29.179 --> 34:32.100
I... I had a previous conviction.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.940
What previous conviction?

34:36.060 --> 34:38.300
Hmm? What previous conviction?

34:39.260 --> 34:40.980
(SOBS) For killing a child.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.300
That's bullshit.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.100
You're lying.

34:47.540 --> 34:49.620
Now if that was the truth,
you'd be in protection.

34:49.699 --> 34:51.020
You'd be dead already.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.580
No, no, 'cause they caught the real killer.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.100
Then why are you here now?

34:58.980 --> 35:00.380
Self defense.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.460
Her husband came after me.

35:04.780 --> 35:06.860
Please, you have to believe me.

35:17.540 --> 35:18.820
(CONTINUES SOBBING)

35:43.660 --> 35:44.660
Fletch?

35:45.820 --> 35:46.820
You told him.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.340
You betrayed my confidence, Vera.

35:53.780 --> 35:55.420
No, I... I didn't say anything.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.540
Then how did he find out?

36:06.660 --> 36:07.740
(DOOR OPENS)

36:11.100 --> 36:12.100
Can I help you?

36:12.860 --> 36:14.620
I... I was looking for Bea.

36:15.020 --> 36:16.020
She's next door.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.460
Yeah.

36:18.100 --> 36:19.980
I thought they'd put you in Jacs' old cell.

36:20.580 --> 36:21.580
Jack?

36:23.780 --> 36:24.820
Is this a trannie block?

36:24.900 --> 36:26.020
(LAUGHS)

36:26.100 --> 36:28.460
Oh, she'd kill you if she
ever heard you say that.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.660
I'm... I'm confused. Where is she?

36:32.260 --> 36:33.340
Oh, she's dead.

36:33.980 --> 36:35.020
Bea killed her.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.940
So, just a word of warning.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.140
Don't mess with Bea.

36:39.780 --> 36:41.060
I wasn't planning on it.

36:41.540 --> 36:42.660
Good.

36:44.460 --> 36:45.540
That's good.

38:10.140 --> 38:11.140
(BEA GRUNTS)

38:42.460 --> 38:43.460
(SCREAMS)

39:20.220 --> 39:21.220
(GROANS)

39:23.900 --> 39:25.180
(PANTING)

39:38.140 --> 39:39.300
Thank you.

39:47.515 --> 39:48.595
How's the patient?

39:49.395 --> 39:50.595
Walking wounded.

39:51.155 --> 39:52.155
She'll live.

39:53.315 --> 39:54.395
Leave us.

39:59.835 --> 40:02.875
It seems your attacker got herself
arrested to get into this prison.

40:04.075 --> 40:05.675
She'll be moved into protection

40:05.755 --> 40:07.835
with an attempted murder
charge tacked onto her sentence.

40:08.395 --> 40:09.555
Glad to hear.

40:10.355 --> 40:14.395
You were very lucky to have that
transgender person there to help.

40:15.235 --> 40:16.795
You know her name is Maxine.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.595
It's useful having friends, isn't it?

40:22.075 --> 40:23.835
None of these people are my friends.

40:27.595 --> 40:29.235
I understand you, Smith.

40:30.075 --> 40:31.235
You're a loner.

40:31.995 --> 40:33.955
But it doesn't pay to be alone in here.

40:34.755 --> 40:36.755
That's why people form alliances.

40:38.035 --> 40:39.875
Who are you suggesting
I form an alliance with?

40:41.795 --> 40:42.795
You?

40:45.435 --> 40:48.235
I'm simply stating there
is strength in numbers.

40:49.835 --> 40:51.595
You're vulnerable when you're alone.

41:04.835 --> 41:05.915
How're you doing?

41:06.675 --> 41:07.875
I'm sore.

41:09.515 --> 41:11.235
You know I found a zip gun in Kat's cell.

41:12.795 --> 41:13.915
What's that?

41:14.075 --> 41:15.395
It's a homemade gun.

41:16.035 --> 41:17.835
Well, I guess I'm lucky she
didn't use that on me, then.

41:17.915 --> 41:18.915
Well, I don't know if
she was the lucky one.

41:18.995 --> 41:20.035
It was booby trapped.

41:20.675 --> 41:21.795
What does that mean?

41:22.755 --> 41:23.995
It means if she'd used it on you,

41:24.075 --> 41:25.795
it would have blinded her
and blown off her hand.

41:52.355 --> 41:54.755
I played right into your hand, didn't I?

41:54.955 --> 41:55.995
What are you on about?

41:56.795 --> 41:58.435
You were hoping that
thing would blow up on me.

41:58.835 --> 42:00.395
Oh, fuckin' settle down, Red.

42:00.795 --> 42:03.195
You've been tight with Simmo
lately. It wasn't meant for you.

42:03.275 --> 42:05.195
Thought you were getting
it for her to use on me.

42:07.275 --> 42:10.195
I'm not stupid enough to put a
weapon into the hands of an enemy.

42:10.275 --> 42:11.275
Yeah?

42:13.555 --> 42:14.955
Well, I'll remember that.

42:24.515 --> 42:26.035
- You okay?
- Yeah.

42:37.515 --> 42:38.595
Maxine?

42:43.115 --> 42:45.435
I, uh, I just wanted to say thanks.

42:46.795 --> 42:48.115
Thanks so much for what you did.

42:49.555 --> 42:50.755
Are you okay?

42:52.395 --> 42:53.395
Yeah.

42:55.995 --> 43:01.435
I heard they found another
weapon in that bitch's cell.

43:02.595 --> 43:03.755
Yeah.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.875
Yeah.

43:11.275 --> 43:12.275
Thanks again.

43:14.755 --> 43:16.355
You know, for what it's worth,

43:17.555 --> 43:19.795
you shouldn't feel shy about
showering with the other women.

43:24.075 --> 43:25.235
You look great.

43:26.555 --> 43:27.555
Really?

43:28.835 --> 43:29.995
Yeah.

43:33.555 --> 43:35.875
And if there's anything
I can ever do for you...

43:38.915 --> 43:39.995
There is.

43:40.955 --> 43:42.675
There was something that, uh,

43:44.595 --> 43:45.995
I've been meaning to ask.

44:03.795 --> 44:05.195
