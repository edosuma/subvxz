00:16.325 --> 00:21.311
Gracias por venir a esta fiesta
de quince años, todos ustedes.

00:32.016 --> 00:35.851
Angelina Trèsbeca!

00:46.053 --> 00:49.889
And now for the traditional
Father-Daughter waltz.

00:52.026 --> 00:54.388
I only wish your mother
was here for your big day.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.604
Would you knock it off?

00:55.606 --> 00:57.523
Why are you in such a bad mood?

00:57.525 --> 00:58.891
Oh, I don't know.

00:58.893 --> 01:01.120
Maybe because I've been tracking
these diamonds

01:01.120 --> 01:02.253
for a month and a half,

01:02.254 --> 01:03.620
I haven't slept in a week,

01:03.622 --> 01:05.422
and I've got stuff going on under my skirt

01:05.424 --> 01:07.590
that you don't even want to know about.

01:11.171 --> 01:13.971
Well, if you were $10 million
in smuggled diamonds

01:13.973 --> 01:15.488
at a quinceañera, where would you be?

01:15.488 --> 01:17.571
If I freakin' knew that,
do you think I would have spent

01:17.573 --> 01:20.024
three freakin' hours getting
into this freakin' dress?

01:23.696 --> 01:26.697
And now for the traditional
hitting of the piñata.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.617
- The piñata!
- The piñata!

01:30.286 --> 01:31.752
Police business.

01:41.881 --> 01:43.764
No diamonds.

01:43.766 --> 01:45.049
Damn it!

01:45.051 --> 01:46.634
They've got to be here somewhere.

01:50.973 --> 01:54.642
And now for the traditional
destroying of the cake.

01:57.813 --> 02:00.731
And now for the traditional
destroying of the gifts.

02:01.984 --> 02:04.151
And the flipping of the tables.

02:04.153 --> 02:06.704
And the punching of the guy.

02:08.514 --> 02:09.763
Bad news, Tribeca.

02:09.764 --> 02:12.099
Turns out the diamonds
crossed the border two days ago.

02:12.102 --> 02:13.401
This was a bum lead.

02:16.990 --> 02:19.858
You said "esta." It's actually "estoy."

02:30.871 --> 02:34.789
Ah, god!

02:34.791 --> 02:36.291
I'm sorry. I said I was sorry.

02:36.293 --> 02:38.009
It stings! It really stings!

02:38.011 --> 02:39.677
I'm not surprised.

02:39.679 --> 02:41.179
It's Tabasco sauce.

02:41.204 --> 02:44.347
Tribeca, get the hell in here!

02:45.993 --> 02:47.659
Here, bite down on that.

02:51.675 --> 02:54.175
It's tender like a bunion,
but it's hard like a corn.

02:54.177 --> 02:54.829
Let me know.

02:54.829 --> 02:55.995
Sit down!

02:55.997 --> 02:57.463
I know what you're gonna say.

02:57.465 --> 02:59.081
Both: You've got some explaining to do.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.467
What happened back there, Tribeca?

03:01.469 --> 03:04.053
I need to get my car washed.

03:04.055 --> 03:07.340
Feb-Ru-tober, Irish center, the Bronx.

03:07.342 --> 03:09.258
You need a break, Tribeca.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.927
Do have and idea how many
vacation days you have saved up?

03:11.929 --> 03:14.180
I don't know? 10? 11?

03:14.182 --> 03:15.231
Try 12!

03:15.233 --> 03:18.286
The job is getting to you, Tribeca.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.086
You're wound too tight.

03:19.086 --> 03:20.919
I could kill you for saying that.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.671
Take the rest of the day off.
I want your badge and your gun.

03:23.674 --> 03:25.841
-Don't you have your own badge and gun?
- I want yours.

03:25.843 --> 03:28.010
What about the golf pro murder
that just came in?

03:28.012 --> 03:29.428
It belongs to Tanner and Geils.

03:29.430 --> 03:30.929
And what new spin are you gonna put

03:30.931 --> 03:32.231
on a black cop and a white cop

03:32.233 --> 03:33.765
working together for the first time?

03:33.767 --> 03:35.150
We'll figure it out!

03:35.152 --> 03:37.603
I just don't know what to do if I'm not
working.

03:37.605 --> 03:40.439
Go out. Meet someone. Have a relationship.

03:40.441 --> 03:41.823
Go on a date.

03:41.825 --> 03:44.943
Lower your defenses, Tribeca.
I know you're lonely.

03:44.945 --> 03:46.192
You don't know me.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.893
Both: I'm fine by myself.
I don't need a relationship.

03:48.894 --> 03:49.894
I'm done with dating.

03:49.895 --> 03:52.647
Flibbity flaxon!

03:56.117 --> 03:57.283
You...

04:01.392 --> 04:02.675
I hope you understand.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.510
It's just that I'm used to riding shotgun.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.345
And I hope you understand, so am I.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.596
Let's put on some music.

04:07.598 --> 04:09.598
Tribeca never lets me listen to the radio.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.900
That was "Yankee Doodle" by Unknown.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.352
Here on Public Domain Radio.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.354
Coming up next, "Silvery Moon" by Unknown.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.738
You listen to Public Domain Radio?

04:16.741 --> 04:17.940
- Yeah.
- Me too!

04:17.942 --> 04:20.024
Yeah, I used to listen to it
all the time in college.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.944
You went to college? I went to college!

04:21.946 --> 04:23.195
- Where'd you go?
- State.

04:23.197 --> 04:25.914
No way! Tech!

04:25.916 --> 04:27.700
- Oh, my god.
- Oh, my god.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.037
 by the light

04:32.039 --> 04:34.456
 of the silvery moon

04:34.458 --> 04:36.625
 not the sun, but the moon

04:36.627 --> 04:39.011
Both:  I want to spoon

04:39.013 --> 04:40.546
 spoon, spoon, spoon

04:40.548 --> 04:45.634
 to my honey, I'll croon love's tune

04:45.636 --> 04:47.803
Here it is. Hoffman, make a right.

04:47.805 --> 04:51.223
Hidden Valley Country Club.
Didn't this used to be a ranch?

04:51.225 --> 04:52.808
They moved to Thousand Islands.

04:52.810 --> 04:54.193
Ah.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.904
Hoffman, see if you can find
a place to put the car.

05:19.324 --> 05:20.395
What do we got here, Scholls?

05:20.395 --> 05:22.729
We got a golf pro, a Mr. Riley Hale.

05:22.731 --> 05:24.531
Appears to be dead.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.732
How'd he die?

05:25.734 --> 05:27.234
His brain and heart stopped.

05:27.236 --> 05:29.202
After that he had no chance.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.237
Interesting.

05:30.239 --> 05:31.738
Whoever did this hit him with a 5-iron,

05:31.740 --> 05:33.240
got him pretty close to death
with a wedge,

05:33.242 --> 05:35.158
and then finished him off with a two-putt.

05:35.160 --> 05:36.993
That's how I would've played it.

05:42.090 --> 05:44.619
Look at these footprints
walking away from the body.

05:44.619 --> 05:45.668
Whoa.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.453
Those are really small.

05:47.455 --> 05:49.788
I'm thinking the killer is a woman.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.707
Good police work, Tanner.

05:51.709 --> 05:54.460
Hey, hey! I'm just building
off your footprint thing.

05:54.462 --> 05:56.462
As soon as the sausage-fest is over,

05:56.464 --> 05:58.514
we can get back to some police work.

05:58.516 --> 06:00.966
Oh, that's gonna be a while.

06:11.312 --> 06:13.195
Okay, day off.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.073
Day off.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.532
Regular person.

06:16.532 --> 06:18.165
Not a cop.

06:20.703 --> 06:23.954
Excuse me, ma'am.
Are you gonna pay for that?

06:23.956 --> 06:26.290
I wasn't planning on it.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.541
I didn't think so.

06:27.543 --> 06:29.092
Oh! Ah!

06:29.094 --> 06:32.262
You're going down, you filthy maggot.

06:32.264 --> 06:34.882
It's a free sample.

06:37.770 --> 06:39.720
Yeah, yeah.

06:39.721 --> 06:43.689
I knew that it was a... fraaaaiy zumple.

06:43.692 --> 06:45.559
It's a free sample.

06:45.561 --> 06:48.862
I have been shopping... one time.

06:48.864 --> 06:50.364
So I'm very familiar

06:50.365 --> 06:53.566
with the concept of vraeeyyy zooomple.

06:53.569 --> 06:54.785
Are you all right?

06:54.787 --> 06:56.486
Yes.

06:56.488 --> 06:57.538
Just...

06:57.540 --> 06:59.406
Just enjoying my...

06:59.407 --> 07:01.741
Fromium zumpumple.

07:05.164 --> 07:06.713
Mmm. Yum.

07:06.714 --> 07:08.748
Fray zumple.

07:13.672 --> 07:15.138
Finding everything all right?

07:15.139 --> 07:18.674
I'm just looking for some individual
spaghetti,

07:18.677 --> 07:20.177
like 10 or 11 strands.

07:20.179 --> 07:21.762
So, you live alone, do you?

07:21.764 --> 07:24.431
What, are you some sort of psychic?

07:24.433 --> 07:27.851
Well, you do have
American cheese very singles.

07:27.853 --> 07:31.104
Flying solo, airplane-style food for one.

07:31.106 --> 07:34.157
And we all dye alone hair dye.

07:34.159 --> 07:35.108
Guilty.

07:35.109 --> 07:37.777
My name's Vic... Deakins.

07:37.779 --> 07:40.279
But you can call me Vic Deakins.

07:40.282 --> 07:43.533
Angie Tribeca.

07:43.535 --> 07:44.952
How many cats do you have?

07:44.954 --> 07:46.837
Oh, what, just 'cause I'm single,

07:46.839 --> 07:49.289
I'm some sort of crazy spinster with 1,000
cats?

07:49.291 --> 07:51.174
No, just 'cause you're eating cat food.

07:51.199 --> 07:53.817
I thought that was the mascot.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.129
I don't shop much.

07:56.131 --> 07:58.715
I'm usually eating at the precinct.

07:58.717 --> 07:59.850
You're a police officer?

07:59.852 --> 08:01.351
No, I'm a detective.

08:01.353 --> 08:02.386
Cool!

08:02.388 --> 08:04.021
My brother's in jail... for life.

08:04.023 --> 08:06.189
Oh, that's such a crazy coincidence.

08:06.191 --> 08:07.140
Yeah.

08:07.142 --> 08:09.476
- So you work here?
- Yeah.

08:09.478 --> 08:12.195
I'm the manager of paper
on rolls department here.

08:12.197 --> 08:13.313
Oh.

08:13.315 --> 08:15.365
I used to have high-powered finance job,

08:15.367 --> 08:17.484
but I didn't like what it was doing to me.

08:17.486 --> 08:20.153
It was making me cynical,
I was snapping at people...

08:20.154 --> 08:23.656
Jesus, Vic Deakins, finish your story!

08:23.659 --> 08:24.958
Sorry.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.661
I just... I haven't had a day off in a
while.

08:27.663 --> 08:28.663
I get it.

08:28.664 --> 08:30.247
I used to be you.

08:31.333 --> 08:34.001
You know, I kind of like you, Angie.

08:34.003 --> 08:38.472
I kind of like... these cups.

08:38.474 --> 08:42.476
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy,

08:42.477 --> 08:44.478
but here's my number.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.846
So call me.

08:45.848 --> 08:48.482
Maybe.

08:53.739 --> 08:58.025
Just gonna grab this for later.

08:58.027 --> 09:01.662
It's a good choice, Angie. Good value.

09:01.664 --> 09:03.530
And they're on sale.

09:08.203 --> 09:09.286
Thank you.

09:10.255 --> 09:12.005
Hurry up! Get the drawer!

09:12.007 --> 09:13.206
Not a cop today.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.175
Not a cop.

09:15.176 --> 09:17.343
Sorry we're late, Dr. Scholls.

09:17.346 --> 09:19.880
Hoffman disappeared with the car.

09:25.304 --> 09:28.055
Did the golf pro's body give us any clues?

09:28.057 --> 09:31.058
There's something unusual about his balls.

09:31.060 --> 09:32.392
Here, take a look.

09:32.394 --> 09:34.978
Look like ordinary balls to me.

09:34.980 --> 09:36.396
Typical white balls.

09:36.398 --> 09:38.949
What are those little letters?

09:38.951 --> 09:41.068
They're monograms.

09:41.069 --> 09:42.118
S.S.

09:42.121 --> 09:44.321
Oh, no, you're looking at them upside down.

09:44.323 --> 09:45.572
Oh, sorry.

09:45.573 --> 09:46.655
S.S.

09:46.658 --> 09:48.075
Exactly.

09:48.077 --> 09:50.160
Now, going on the theory
that the killer is a woman,

09:50.162 --> 09:51.745
I looked into the membership roster

09:51.747 --> 09:54.081
and there's only one woman at
the club with those initials...

09:54.083 --> 09:55.582
Samantha Stephens.

09:55.584 --> 09:57.884
Turns out she used to take
lessons from the dead golf pro.

09:57.886 --> 10:00.049
Why would she take lessons
from a dead golf pro?

10:00.074 --> 10:01.505
We're still looking into it.

10:01.507 --> 10:03.320
Do you think you can help us
figure out what happened?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.320
Oh, no, I'm afraid not.

10:04.321 --> 10:06.204
But I know who can.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.322
Oh, good.

10:07.324 --> 10:09.074
But he lives in Australia.

10:09.076 --> 10:09.991
Oh, too bad.

10:09.993 --> 10:12.294
Nine months out of the year.

10:12.296 --> 10:14.079
- He's here right now.
- Perfect.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.502
Scott, will you see if Dr. Hook
is available to join us?

10:20.504 --> 10:22.337
Thank you.

10:22.339 --> 10:23.972
He's just brushing his teeth.

10:23.974 --> 10:26.091
Now, Dr. Templeton Hook is the leading

10:26.093 --> 10:28.593
crime re-creation specialist in the world.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.228
He spent seven years
at Interpol, two at the C.I.A.,

10:31.231 --> 10:32.514
and was a visiting lecturer

10:32.516 --> 10:34.516
in the criminology department at Harvard.

10:38.155 --> 10:39.270
He's an eccentric genius.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.573
Dr. Hook, can you please show us

10:41.575 --> 10:44.492
exactly how the golf pro murder occurred?

10:44.494 --> 10:46.661
Watch a master at work.

10:46.663 --> 10:50.582
Okay, first, the perp took a sip of tea.

10:50.583 --> 10:52.866
- Pbht!
- And then he blew raspberries.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.869
Then he pick-pocketed the victim.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.871
And then he poked him.
He poked him repeatedly.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.540
Then he ripped his hair off.

10:58.542 --> 11:00.842
I don't know how I missed that
in the autopsy.

11:00.844 --> 11:04.212
And then he stole his glasses.

11:04.214 --> 11:06.214
I don't know how accurate he is,
but he's adorable.

11:06.216 --> 11:09.384
Oh, no, this is scientific
genius at its best.

11:09.386 --> 11:10.885
Is he drinking urine?

11:10.887 --> 11:12.020
He sure is.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.895
Go out. Meet someone.

12:15.852 --> 12:19.437
Have a relationship. Go on a date.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.656
You know you're lonely.

12:21.658 --> 12:24.083
Lonely... lonely...

12:24.154 --> 12:25.319
I heard you!

12:25.321 --> 12:26.654
Okay, okay.

12:26.656 --> 12:28.573
Thanks for letting me use your bathroom.

12:28.575 --> 12:30.625
I didn't think I could make it home.

12:40.003 --> 12:41.552
Hey, it's Angie Tribeca.

12:41.554 --> 12:44.338
Would you like to have dinner with me?

12:46.009 --> 12:47.842
No! Call the guy!

12:47.844 --> 12:48.676
Fine!

12:55.852 --> 12:58.402
- Excuse me, Mrs. Stephens?
- Yeah?

12:58.426 --> 12:59.988
_

12:59.989 --> 13:02.323
We're Detectives Geils
and Tanner from the L.A.P.D.

13:02.325 --> 13:03.941
We have a few questions for you.

13:03.965 --> 13:07.674
_

13:07.817 --> 13:09.061
I'm sorry, come again?

13:09.085 --> 13:10.365
_

13:10.366 --> 13:11.666
Still not getting it.

13:11.690 --> 13:12.584
_

13:12.585 --> 13:15.536
Ah, mimosa. Yes, we'll take two, please.

13:15.538 --> 13:17.288
I don't know if you were aware of this,

13:17.290 --> 13:18.935
but Riley Hale was found dead this morning.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.959
_

13:21.344 --> 13:23.344
You're clearly and visibly upset.

13:23.346 --> 13:24.134
Were you close?

13:24.158 --> 13:26.158
_

13:26.182 --> 13:27.863
That explains her coy smile.

13:27.887 --> 13:31.285
_

13:31.554 --> 13:34.240
So, he broke it off. Did that
make you mad enough to kill?

13:34.264 --> 13:36.141
_

13:36.142 --> 13:38.596
Because he was found dead
with your balls in his hand.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.229
_

13:40.230 --> 13:41.626
Then who's S.S.?

13:41.650 --> 13:46.995
_

13:47.120 --> 13:49.065
So, you never played
with your husband's balls?

13:49.089 --> 13:50.684
_

13:50.685 --> 13:52.051
Ma'am, I'm going to need you

13:52.053 --> 13:53.970
to stop your uncontrollable laughter.

13:53.972 --> 13:55.188
This is serious.

13:55.190 --> 13:56.973
Now, where we can find your husband?

13:56.997 --> 14:00.875
_

14:00.945 --> 14:03.229
All right, let's check it out.

14:03.253 --> 14:06.947
_

14:15.979 --> 14:18.228
So, we got Stephens' balls
at the crime scene.

14:18.228 --> 14:19.177
We got motive...

14:19.179 --> 14:20.928
The guy was sleeping with his wife.

14:20.930 --> 14:23.931
The one thing I can't figure out
is the small footprints.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.600
Excuse me.

14:25.602 --> 14:26.934
There's a dress code.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.363
Which one's Stephens?

14:35.133 --> 14:37.717
Eric Stephens? L.A.P.D.

14:37.720 --> 14:40.387
Oh, please, call me Short-game.

14:40.389 --> 14:41.805
And you are...?

14:41.807 --> 14:43.641
Yes, we are.

14:43.643 --> 14:46.727
What do you know about the death
of Riley Hale, the golf pro?

14:46.729 --> 14:49.313
I don't know anything
about Riley Thomas Hale.

14:49.315 --> 14:51.532
1960-2015. Protestant.

14:51.534 --> 14:54.201
- From the Massachusetts Hales.
- Do you know that two of your golf balls

14:54.203 --> 14:55.569
were found in his hand?

14:55.570 --> 14:57.987
That's where those went!
It's been driving me crazy.

14:57.990 --> 15:01.075
Uh... I mean, no.

15:01.077 --> 15:02.326
You know what I think?

15:02.328 --> 15:04.495
I think Hale was sleeping with your wife

15:04.497 --> 15:06.463
so you hired a woman to kill him.

15:06.465 --> 15:08.749
You can't pin that on me!

15:08.751 --> 15:12.386
Now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me,

15:12.388 --> 15:14.471
I have a tee time.

15:19.269 --> 15:20.790
Mr. Stephens, you're under arrest

15:20.790 --> 15:22.873
for the murder of Riley Hale.

15:32.051 --> 15:34.302
There he is! Police business!

15:38.057 --> 15:40.941
Stephens, hold it right there!

15:44.397 --> 15:45.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:45.982 --> 15:47.231
There is a foursome ahead of you.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.400
We got to catch that guy!

15:49.402 --> 15:51.452
I will let you in
right after these ladies.

15:51.454 --> 15:53.537
Ah.

15:55.594 --> 15:58.428
Ooh. Take another one, Sweetheart.

15:58.430 --> 16:00.397
We're not in a rush.

16:01.433 --> 16:03.984
Vic: Thank you for going to all the
trouble.

16:03.986 --> 16:05.485
That was delicious.

16:05.487 --> 16:06.653
It's nothing.

16:06.655 --> 16:09.523
The milk was gonna go bad anyway.

16:09.525 --> 16:11.491
Just made it perfect.

16:14.113 --> 16:16.163
Do you mind if we listen to the radio?

16:16.165 --> 16:17.497
I think I'd love that.

16:20.419 --> 16:23.503
All available units,
bank robbery in progress.

16:23.505 --> 16:24.955
Suspect armed and dangerous.

16:24.957 --> 16:27.507
Tribeca, this is Lieutenant Atkins.

16:27.509 --> 16:29.426
I told you, no police business.

16:29.428 --> 16:30.961
Now get back to your date!

16:30.963 --> 16:32.297
And that's an order.

16:32.765 --> 16:34.631
Thanks for letting me use your shower.

16:34.633 --> 16:36.516
I didn't think I could make it home.

16:38.470 --> 16:39.519
You seem distracted.

16:39.521 --> 16:40.888
Aah! You're still here!

16:40.890 --> 16:41.890
Sorry.

16:43.705 --> 16:45.696
I'm just thinking about work.

16:45.696 --> 16:48.279
Well, it's obvious
that you're married to your job.

16:48.281 --> 16:51.916
You know what? I am.

16:51.918 --> 16:55.453
And I want to have kids with it
and grow old with it.

16:56.393 --> 16:59.372
And when it's too old
to remember who I am anymore,

16:59.372 --> 17:00.921
I want to read it stories,

17:00.923 --> 17:02.498
and then I want to be buried next to it

17:02.501 --> 17:04.944
under the old apple tree
in front of the precinct.

17:05.241 --> 17:08.776
Well, when you and your job
decide to part ways,

17:08.778 --> 17:11.362
promise you'll let me know, huh?

17:11.364 --> 17:13.748
I'll do that, Vic Deakins.

17:13.750 --> 17:17.167
Heck, who am I to talk.
It seems I'm married, too.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.075
To your job?

17:18.099 --> 17:20.789
To my wife, April. She thinks I'm bowling.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.623
- You should go.
- I should.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.626
Bowling is exercise,
and when you form leagues...

17:25.627 --> 17:27.011
Seriously, get the hell out.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.848
I got to go in a second.

17:31.755 --> 17:34.270
But the good thing is...

17:34.269 --> 17:36.520
I'm not giving up on you.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.990
See you tomorrow morning?

17:38.992 --> 17:41.409
I hope not.

17:49.886 --> 17:51.719
Excuse me, ladies,
do you mind if we play through?

17:51.721 --> 17:53.805
We're trying to catch a killer
who's two holes ahead.

17:53.807 --> 17:56.024
Shh!

17:59.979 --> 18:02.397
I'll get it, Ethel.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.624
So, what are we doing here?
Are we partners or what?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.960
Why do you have to put a label
on everything?

18:15.962 --> 18:16.994
Can't we just have fun?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.664
I mean, don't you feel a little guilty

18:19.666 --> 18:21.916
being with me instead of Tribeca?

18:21.918 --> 18:23.751
I mean, obviously I miss her.

18:23.753 --> 18:26.637
But maybe we weren't meant
to have just one partner.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.090
In France, cops have all kinds of partners

18:29.092 --> 18:30.425
and no one thinks twice.

18:31.239 --> 18:34.248
How about we do this
until it stops being fun?

18:34.597 --> 18:37.464
All right, I'll stop over thinking it.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.562
We're just two cops playing golf
trying to catch a killer.

18:40.561 --> 18:41.594
Yeah.

18:41.596 --> 18:42.762
You're up, partner.

18:42.764 --> 18:44.897
Sorry, just kidding.

18:44.899 --> 18:46.432
Unless that felt right.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.195
Found it!

18:57.165 --> 18:58.165
You see him?

18:58.166 --> 18:59.216
He's on the green.

18:59.218 --> 19:02.135
If he makes this putt, we'll never get him.

19:02.137 --> 19:03.336
Let's hit into him.

19:03.338 --> 19:04.888
That's frowned upon.

19:06.758 --> 19:08.225
We're gonna need a miracle.

19:09.428 --> 19:13.096
No miracle... Officer David Hoffman!

19:14.650 --> 19:17.901
Go. Go to him.

19:20.939 --> 19:23.406
Hoffman, I love you buddy!

19:25.777 --> 19:29.613
 by the light

19:29.615 --> 19:32.699
 of the silvery moon

19:34.286 --> 19:39.122
 I want to spoon

19:39.124 --> 19:45.845
 to my honey, I'll croon love's tune

19:45.847 --> 19:50.967
I missed you, too, partner.

20:13.575 --> 20:15.075
Tribeca.

20:15.077 --> 20:17.794
Hey, it's me. Just calling
to see how your day off was.

20:17.796 --> 20:19.663
Not too bad. It was pretty relaxing.

20:19.665 --> 20:21.331
Hope you didn't miss me too much.

20:21.333 --> 20:22.499
Nope.

20:22.501 --> 20:24.000
I hear it in your voice.

20:24.002 --> 20:26.953
All right, I'll see you tomorrow, partner.

20:26.983 --> 20:27.967
Okay, partner.
