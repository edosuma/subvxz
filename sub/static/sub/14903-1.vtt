You were pleased.

and whipped them...

until their tortured flesh
was torn to shreds.

Oh, yes. That's it.
And she clipped off their fingers with shears.

into their faces.

40:01.816 --> 40:03.442
And when they parted their lips to scream,

40:03.526 --> 40:05.694
she shoved the flaming rod
up into their mouths.

40:05.779 --> 40:09.073
- Stop it.
- Oh, yes, yes. Go on. Go on.

40:09.157 --> 40:12.076
She pierced their veins with rusty nails...

40:12.160 --> 40:14.328
- and slit their throats.
- Stop it!

40:14.454 --> 40:19.541
- So that their white bodies
pumped out young blood over her naked skin.
- Stop it!

40:19.626 --> 40:23.170
- Blood, beautiful red blood--
- Stop it!

40:23.254 --> 40:28.592

I'm sure we're going to be
such good friends, the three of us.

1:37:28.426 --> 1:37:32.429
Anyway, as long as we're
shipwrecked here together
in this fortress--

1:37:35.975 --> 1:37:40.771
I can't tell you how much
I despise this kind of place.

1:37:42.190 --> 1:37:46.193
Especially now,
when there's no one.

1:37:47.529 --> 1:37:49.571
I've just fled from such a place.
