Raaaah!
Raaah! Come on!

00:51.620 --> 00:53.395
Get ready, toids!

00:54.080 --> 00:55.145
Raaah!

00:55.274 --> 00:57.645
I'm mean as a bus,
and I'm mad as rocks!

00:57.965 --> 00:59.194
Gumball guardians!

00:59.262 --> 01:01.028
There's an enemy at the gates!

01:01.106 --> 01:02.934
I'm an
all-you-can-eat maniac!

01:03.002 --> 01:05.574
Whoops!
Aw, come on!

01:07.016 --> 01:08.824
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

01:10.551 --> 01:12.319
Whoopee!

01:17.099 --> 01:19.487
Thank you, little candies.
Thank you.

01:19.555 --> 01:26.289
You warm the wax heart
of this poor king of Ooo!

01:26.453 --> 01:28.201
Now, I hear you asking,

01:28.320 --> 01:31.773
"King of Ooo,
how can you be so wise?"

01:31.906 --> 01:33.340
I'll tell you how.

01:33.500 --> 01:37.005
Did you know
that I am 8,000 years old?

01:37.179 --> 01:38.630
Could be.

01:40.623 --> 01:41.633
It's true.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.701
I'm that wonderful.

01:46.607 --> 01:51.537
Now, Princess Bubblegum...
she <i> says</i> she hasn't gone rogue.

01:51.638 --> 01:55.466
She <i> says</i>  she's not
a wild dog thirsty for blood.

01:55.591 --> 01:58.912
She <i> says</i>
she's not a literal baby

01:59.005 --> 02:01.623
masquerading
as an adult woman.

02:01.740 --> 02:03.503
She says a lot of things.

02:03.685 --> 02:08.404
Princess Bubblegum,
you don't make sense!

02:09.466 --> 02:11.211
This guy's
really working on me.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.818
Ennnh...

02:14.677 --> 02:17.765
Yes, dear?
Do you have something to say?

02:17.833 --> 02:19.078
Mm-hmm.

02:19.146 --> 02:22.341
I'm James's mother,
mrs. James.

02:22.466 --> 02:26.117
My son got turned into
a mutant mass

02:26.194 --> 02:29.196
and was exiled
to the badlands

02:29.279 --> 02:32.285
by Princess Bubblegum.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.787
Trehh! Boo.

02:36.873 --> 02:40.131
Who <i> isn't</i> mad
about their mutant children?

02:40.208 --> 02:42.175
What about sweet P, King of Ooo?

02:42.252 --> 02:44.966
You threatened to burn down
his mama's orchard.

02:45.060 --> 02:47.438
I did.
That is true.

02:47.515 --> 02:50.896
Sweet P,
I was like a cornered animal.

02:50.964 --> 02:53.630
"I knew no' what thy doone."

02:53.849 --> 02:55.522
I'm sorry, sweet p.

02:55.614 --> 02:57.439
Here.

02:58.677 --> 03:00.544
Psst... Give me a kiss.

03:01.008 --> 03:03.341
Do you hear us,
Princess Bubblegum?

03:03.419 --> 03:05.098
Do you hear us?!

03:05.175 --> 03:07.658
Shhhhhhhhut up.

03:07.735 --> 03:10.310
Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you,

03:10.466 --> 03:13.349
but I feel
that you must campaign.

03:13.466 --> 03:15.935
The candy people
are real dumb.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.845
I'm studying something
that could be real important.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.802
Dah!
This dumb election.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.111
It's not even...

03:22.185 --> 03:24.748
I mean, it's barely even...

03:25.147 --> 03:26.726
Barely even legal.

03:26.794 --> 03:30.474
"A barely
and yet fully legal election"...

03:30.591 --> 03:32.826
That's what
my campaign manager told me.

03:32.894 --> 03:33.937
Let's hear it for him...

03:34.005 --> 03:35.287
Mr. X!

03:35.455 --> 03:37.060
Weird, right?

03:39.271 --> 03:43.289
And even being legal,
I mean, I <i> made</i> everyone.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.664
I made their homes.

03:44.732 --> 03:48.115
The candy people are mercurial,
but they're not dillweeds.

03:48.201 --> 03:51.076
And this
definitely legal election

03:51.145 --> 03:55.415
is in the jam-covered fingers
of you, the people...

03:55.531 --> 03:57.248
The candies.

03:58.732 --> 03:59.937
So, go.

04:00.005 --> 04:03.121
Vote with your hearts.
Vote with your minds.

04:03.292 --> 04:07.363
Vote for the candidate
who's <i> not</i> a teenage gum-golem.

04:08.363 --> 04:10.887
I mean,
they know that I love them.

04:11.074 --> 04:13.215
And the votes are in.

04:13.317 --> 04:16.988
King of ooo
is our new Princess.

04:18.606 --> 04:19.630
Hey, hey!

04:19.707 --> 04:21.507
What?!

04:23.911 --> 04:26.043
Whaaaaat?!

04:26.199 --> 04:28.465
You dillweeds!

04:28.551 --> 04:29.670
You're a dillweed,

04:29.738 --> 04:31.342
you're a dillweed's secretary,

04:31.410 --> 04:33.973
and you're probably
some dillweed I've never met!

04:34.113 --> 04:36.413
You're three dillweeds
being dillweeds,

04:36.490 --> 04:39.793
and you're going to dillweed
this place into the ground!

04:40.090 --> 04:41.832
And <i> You...</i>

04:53.084 --> 04:55.142
Princess! Princess!

04:55.959 --> 04:57.540
I don't know
what a dillweed is.

04:57.623 --> 04:59.126
Hey, pb, what's the plan?

04:59.194 --> 05:00.951
WE PLEDGED OUR ALLEGIANCE
TO <i> YOU.</i>

05:01.092 --> 05:03.670
Your allegiance
is to the kingdom.

05:03.810 --> 05:05.186
Dudes, I don't know.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.319
I don't know
when I'll be back in charge...

05:07.537 --> 05:09.561
<i>If</i>  I'll be back in charge.

05:09.709 --> 05:11.516
I need you both
to stick around here

05:11.584 --> 05:13.780
and make sure
the candy people are safe,

05:13.928 --> 05:16.405
even if it means
working for a wad.

05:16.616 --> 05:19.084
Auf wiedersehen,
meine champions.

05:19.232 --> 05:20.420
Mwah.

05:20.803 --> 05:21.835

06:05.066 --> 06:06.757
It's stuck.

06:20.084 --> 06:21.803
Ho, no, no, no, no!

06:21.967 --> 06:23.912
It's okay, everyone.
It's okay.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.741
Close your eyes
and repeat your safety mantra...

06:26.863 --> 06:30.381
Hoodie hoodie hoodup,
hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie...

06:30.498 --> 06:32.131
Princess? Huh?

06:32.444 --> 06:34.170
Oh. Sorry, peps.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.623
I'm just so used to having
my citizens around to protect.

06:37.811 --> 06:40.006
This is gonna
take some getting used to.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.311
Permission to speak freely,
ma'am?

06:42.405 --> 06:43.540
Granted.

06:43.608 --> 06:45.493
This horrible dump
does not meet

06:45.561 --> 06:48.412
the level of fancy to which
I have become accustomed.

06:48.496 --> 06:49.636
Noted.

06:49.733 --> 06:51.186
Also, FYI...

06:51.272 --> 06:54.491
My uncle gumbald built
this cabin with his bare hands.

06:54.656 --> 06:57.178
I spent my summers here
when I was younger.

06:57.491 --> 07:00.438
Anyway, it'll probably
take a <i> really</i> long time

07:00.506 --> 07:01.883
for the candy people
to realize

07:01.951 --> 07:04.147
a bad ruler
is worse than a good ruler.

07:04.303 --> 07:06.733
Plenty of time
to spruce this place up.

07:13.069 --> 07:14.366
Whew!

07:14.466 --> 07:17.377
Starchy thought life would be
better under the King of Ooo,

07:17.494 --> 07:19.725
but now there's
even more stuff to sweep.

07:19.803 --> 07:21.524
Poor old starchy.

07:21.592 --> 07:23.685
Always getting
the sweaty end of the lollipop.

07:23.753 --> 07:25.297
Hey, starchy.
What are you doing... sweeping?

07:25.365 --> 07:27.383
Oh, uh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.

07:27.451 --> 07:29.428
Suh-wee-ee-eepin'.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.616
- Yeah.
- Mm.

07:31.717 --> 07:33.911
Hey, is it me,
or is getting purpler out here?

07:33.979 --> 07:35.094
Oh, yeah.

07:35.162 --> 07:36.943
I think
that's the catalyst comet.

07:37.068 --> 07:38.929
Guess it's getting pretty close
or whatever.

07:39.015 --> 07:40.451
Getting Close?

07:40.583 --> 07:41.841
Should we evacuate or...

07:41.918 --> 07:44.669
What? No, no.
It's cool, I think.

07:44.746 --> 07:47.719
It's just here to, like, shake
things up, you know? It's okay.

07:47.787 --> 07:49.802
We've got sort of a...
A relationship.

07:49.873 --> 07:54.123
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?!

07:54.271 --> 07:56.427
Oh, starchy
don't feel good about this.

07:56.537 --> 07:57.998
- Starch?
- Eht.

07:58.396 --> 08:01.051
Starchy's mind
is burdened.

08:01.128 --> 08:04.070
Oh, Mrs. Gumdrop!
He's coming.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.234
The comet... it's gonna snuff
out all life as we know it.

08:06.302 --> 08:07.633
- What?!
- Oh, Good Glob!

08:07.701 --> 08:09.133
Shouldn't we try
and calm them down?

08:09.201 --> 08:10.992
Ehh, not after that whole

08:11.060 --> 08:13.191
"knock my tower over
onto the castle" thing.

08:13.777 --> 08:15.333
A lot of guys got smooshed.

08:15.521 --> 08:17.990
They need to hear it
from someone they really trust.

08:18.404 --> 08:19.813
King of Ooo!
King of Ooo!

08:19.905 --> 08:21.596
- King of Ooo?
- King of Ooo?

08:21.665 --> 08:22.966
King of ooo?

08:23.060 --> 08:24.685
Wait, are you saying
"King of Ooo"?

08:24.753 --> 08:25.867
What are you saying?

08:25.935 --> 08:28.060
I thought it was
"Kinkoff Goo."

08:29.397 --> 08:31.264
Hey. You hear that?

08:31.911 --> 08:33.332
Downstairs.

08:33.912 --> 08:35.419
King of Ooo?

08:36.052 --> 08:37.279
King of Ooo?

08:37.347 --> 08:38.748
King of Ooo!

08:43.562 --> 08:44.653
What the...

08:44.721 --> 08:46.112
It's that guy
from before.

08:46.307 --> 08:48.260
He's mucking around
with PB's ship...

08:48.346 --> 08:50.260
Added all kinds of engines
to it.

08:50.807 --> 08:51.877
Hey!

08:53.096 --> 08:55.539
Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

08:55.705 --> 08:57.510
PB don't let <i> nobody</i>
touch her stuff...

08:57.612 --> 08:59.755
Not even me, and I'm cool...
Least of all you,

08:59.823 --> 09:01.848
you sauce-tasting
brian-sniffer... whoa!

09:01.916 --> 09:03.448
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:03.516 --> 09:05.534
Yeeh! Yeeh! Yeeh!

09:05.602 --> 09:06.752
Whoa!

09:06.862 --> 09:07.961
Uhhh!

09:08.370 --> 09:10.010
NO MERCY, JAKE.

09:16.563 --> 09:18.221
Aaaaah!

09:19.159 --> 09:20.564
Hey, I'm back...

09:20.690 --> 09:22.942
What the bing bong
ping pong?!

09:23.120 --> 09:24.987
Gunther?!

09:26.362 --> 09:28.346
What the King Kong
sing song?!

09:28.484 --> 09:29.942
Whoaaaa... oof!

09:31.400 --> 09:33.924
Sayonara, suckers!

09:38.303 --> 09:40.270
Uhh...

09:42.385 --> 09:43.704
Ugh!

09:43.846 --> 09:45.999
Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet!

09:46.076 --> 09:47.734
Comet! Comet!

09:47.811 --> 09:48.832
Oww!

09:48.900 --> 09:50.401
Aaaaah!

09:52.932 --> 09:55.659
Toronto, I've been Princess
for four hours,

09:55.752 --> 09:57.944
and society has already
totally collapsed.

09:58.021 --> 10:00.260
Plus, now the sky is falling,
I guess.

10:00.424 --> 10:03.616
Is this possibly...
Somehow my fault?

10:03.693 --> 10:04.734
Pbbt!

10:04.802 --> 10:07.299
No way!
Okay, look.

10:07.424 --> 10:10.276
Without your calming presence
and selfless leadership,

10:10.370 --> 10:12.759
this situation would have been
a hundred times worse.

10:12.836 --> 10:16.159
History will remember you
as ooo's greatest hero.

10:16.338 --> 10:18.315
As always,
the voice of reason.

10:18.487 --> 10:21.592
Once again, my saintly nature
has compelled me,

10:21.669 --> 10:24.771
unthinking, to assume
the burdens of others.

10:24.948 --> 10:28.596
But a true justice
demands a true accounting.

10:28.783 --> 10:33.862
And truly this is all
Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!

10:33.932 --> 10:34.981
Oof!

10:35.049 --> 10:38.838
Good Glob!
What no-o-o-o-o-w?

10:43.559 --> 10:45.117
Looking good, peps.

10:45.573 --> 10:47.932
Man, this feels
kind of good, right?

10:48.026 --> 10:51.120
It's like we're building a whole
new kingdom from scratch,

10:51.252 --> 10:54.362
only without all
my beloved citizens this time.

10:54.471 --> 10:57.729
And their dull,
pleading chicken eyes.

10:57.971 --> 10:59.129
Maybe the King of Ooo

10:59.206 --> 11:01.213
<i>Could</i> hold down the fort
for a little while.

11:01.346 --> 11:03.354
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

11:03.502 --> 11:05.541
Anyway, I'm gonna
get some fresh air.

11:05.688 --> 11:06.830
B.R.B.

11:07.314 --> 11:08.416

11:19.171 --> 11:20.311
What the...

11:20.448 --> 11:22.292
Why's it so purple outsi...

11:23.105 --> 11:24.371
What?

11:25.113 --> 11:27.597
It's too smoky to see.

11:27.675 --> 11:29.371
Oh! Something's peeking.

11:29.449 --> 11:32.270
Someone's jacking
your spaceship!

11:34.043 --> 11:35.620
That <i>is</i> my ship!

11:35.723 --> 11:37.628
But it looks like
it's been modded out.

11:37.696 --> 11:38.957
That much engine power...

11:39.027 --> 11:40.425
It'll break through
the atmosphere

11:40.493 --> 11:42.988
before I can do anything
to stop it.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.855
Finn and Jake!

11:44.936 --> 11:46.814
Yeah! Get that guy!

11:46.954 --> 11:49.017
- Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

11:51.207 --> 11:52.525
- Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

11:52.600 --> 11:54.103
Oof!

11:55.753 --> 11:57.095
My Thorn.

11:57.382 --> 11:59.197
I think
we should go inside.

12:00.540 --> 12:01.874
Oof!

12:13.338 --> 12:15.275
Gunther!
What are you doing?!

12:15.400 --> 12:16.723
What <i>am</i> I doing?

12:16.791 --> 12:21.322
A fog shrouds my true intent
even from myself.

12:21.943 --> 12:23.127
There!

12:23.197 --> 12:24.649
The catalyst comet.

12:24.830 --> 12:26.431
It all becomes clear.

12:26.606 --> 12:28.446
I am more than Gunther.

12:28.595 --> 12:32.486
Like a mighty chrysalis
pushing out of a damp cocoon,

12:32.554 --> 12:34.861
I emerge!

12:37.296 --> 12:38.705
Jake! You okay?

12:38.773 --> 12:41.366
Yeah, man.
Just don't croak out here.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.694
Hey, man,
look at Gunther.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.865
Behold!

12:47.741 --> 12:50.030
I am orgalorg!

12:50.326 --> 12:51.819
Whoa.

12:52.690 --> 12:54.124
That's pretty.

12:54.192 --> 12:55.358
Looks good, right?

12:55.589 --> 12:56.968
Hey, where's Glob?

12:57.085 --> 12:59.773
I don't know.
Um, he exploded in space.

12:59.841 --> 13:01.007
Yeah, thought so.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.694
Man,
are you still Gunther?

13:02.819 --> 13:04.515
'Cause you seem like
you're <i>not.</i>

13:04.583 --> 13:05.796
I'm orgalorg.

13:05.929 --> 13:07.898
Well, what the heck
are you doing, orgalorg?

13:08.046 --> 13:10.085
It was just
time to come out again.

13:10.183 --> 13:11.884
Glob K.O.-Ing himself,

13:11.967 --> 13:14.093
the arrival
of the catalyst comet,

13:14.194 --> 13:17.304
and a ship to carry me
out of this planet's gravity...

13:17.382 --> 13:21.374
These are doorways
the universe presented to me.

13:21.554 --> 13:24.351
Oh, I know about
open-door philosophy.

13:24.515 --> 13:27.257
What's that? You just
say yes to stuff all the time?

13:27.324 --> 13:28.335
Pretty much.

13:28.481 --> 13:29.515
That seems all right.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.736
It's all yours,

13:30.804 --> 13:32.181
if you're
willing to take it.

13:32.249 --> 13:36.030
Destroy worlds,
crush anyone blocking the door.

13:36.163 --> 13:40.491
Feel their bones crumple
and their goo spill out.

13:40.663 --> 13:42.069
I don't like that
at all.

13:42.194 --> 13:43.495
He made it ugly.

13:43.608 --> 13:45.788
You can't stop me.
I'm orgalorg.

13:45.960 --> 13:47.812
I'm pretty sure
I can take you, bro.

13:47.929 --> 13:51.507
Not after I absorb the power
and knowledge of that comet.

13:51.765 --> 13:54.638
Absorb a triple salchow
to your kneecaps.

13:54.860 --> 13:55.921
Oof!

13:56.167 --> 13:57.666
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

13:57.910 --> 13:59.960
- Grab my hand!
- Okay.

14:00.686 --> 14:01.712
Shoot.

14:01.780 --> 14:03.077
Hey, stop drifting!

14:03.145 --> 14:04.315
I'm not trying to!

14:04.383 --> 14:06.733
Ooh! Maybe I can use
jet propulsion.

14:08.852 --> 14:10.285
Oh, no, I can't breathe.

14:10.353 --> 14:11.515
Jake, no!

14:11.601 --> 14:14.280
Don't worry, man!
I'm working out a plan!

14:14.360 --> 14:15.835
Freaking bing bong!

14:15.937 --> 14:18.093
Jake's gonna fulfill
his croak dream after all.

14:18.179 --> 14:21.038
And that dirty umbrella
is gonna enslave the universe.

14:22.288 --> 14:23.665
Cram... come on.

14:23.733 --> 14:25.270
This is gonna take forever.

14:25.671 --> 14:27.796
Man,
I'm gonna croak out here,

14:27.898 --> 14:30.274
like a fish
in the hands of a child.

14:37.766 --> 14:38.851
Okay, Finn.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.453
Time to make an appeal
to greater forces.

14:41.819 --> 14:47.725
♪ Everything's
falling into place ♪

14:48.319 --> 14:54.686
♪ I'm right where I should be ♪

14:55.373 --> 15:01.553
♪ The tides of life
all led me here ♪

15:02.420 --> 15:08.584
♪ And that's why
I'm not scared ♪

15:09.568 --> 15:14.841
♪ I know the answer will appear, ♪

15:14.909 --> 15:18.247
♪ ple-e-e-ease ♪

15:18.622 --> 15:20.059
Hey, spaceman.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.559
Wha... dad?!

15:21.707 --> 15:24.559
This is so crazy, Finn.

15:24.664 --> 15:26.358
What are you doing
out here?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.738
Floating to my grave!
Hurry up and save me!

15:28.856 --> 15:31.660
Can't, buddy.
This baby does what it wants.

15:31.751 --> 15:33.090
Are you kidding me?!

15:33.238 --> 15:34.598
No, for real.
Look.

15:34.738 --> 15:37.301
Hey.
Get that guy there!

15:37.455 --> 15:40.293
See?
I'm just flying random-style.

15:40.395 --> 15:41.418
It's not random!

15:41.488 --> 15:43.629
I merged my intention
with the universe.

15:43.697 --> 15:44.716
You what?

15:44.784 --> 15:46.746
Oh! Wait.
I have an idea.

15:46.814 --> 15:47.840
Really?

15:47.910 --> 15:49.723
Here... grab on this.

15:50.356 --> 15:51.955
No, it's cool.
You got gloves on.

15:52.023 --> 15:53.356
Oh, yeah.

15:57.199 --> 15:58.233
You all right?

15:58.303 --> 15:59.397
Yeah.

15:59.497 --> 16:01.624
Thanks, dad.
Thanks, universe.

16:01.694 --> 16:02.702
Come again?

16:02.772 --> 16:04.118
Oh! We got to save Jake!

16:04.186 --> 16:05.603
He's out there
choking on gas!

16:05.671 --> 16:08.706
Like I said, I got
no control over this beast.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.860
We're on
a journey into mystery,

16:10.928 --> 16:13.882
unless I figure out
what this bozo responds to.

16:14.053 --> 16:15.407
It's kind of fun, right?

16:15.475 --> 16:19.327
See, there's no reason
or purpose or what you said...

16:19.514 --> 16:21.647
Uh, universal intention.

16:21.721 --> 16:22.987
Look around, Finn.

16:23.147 --> 16:25.835
Empty crud.
So empty.

16:26.046 --> 16:27.921
I don't know.
There's some stars and stuff.

16:28.046 --> 16:31.178
You're squeezed so tight,
your bottom's gonna fall out.

16:31.297 --> 16:33.064
Put the phone down.

16:33.132 --> 16:34.811
- "Put the phone down"?
- Yeah...

16:34.934 --> 16:36.022
Whoa!

16:36.090 --> 16:37.483
What's going on, huh?

16:37.574 --> 16:39.262
Look!
The light of the comet.

16:39.405 --> 16:40.686
Ahh.

16:41.077 --> 16:42.485
That's pretty neat.

16:42.553 --> 16:44.811
This moth
is so bananas, man.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.483
"Bananas, man."

16:46.551 --> 16:48.186
"Bananas, man."

16:48.275 --> 16:49.952
Uh-oh. What's that?

16:50.412 --> 16:52.436
Almost there.

16:52.639 --> 16:54.785
That dude's gonna absorb
the comet's mystical power

16:54.853 --> 16:55.944
and crush everybody.

16:56.013 --> 16:57.710
Who the heck
raises guys like that?

16:57.874 --> 16:59.884
You think he had
neglectful parents, like you?

16:59.952 --> 17:02.327
Or would he have <i>always</i> been
a no-good orgalorg?

17:02.444 --> 17:04.994
Oh, gob slops!
Not orgalorg!

17:05.124 --> 17:06.210
You... you...
You know him?

17:06.278 --> 17:07.359
Yeah!

17:07.428 --> 17:09.099
What do you think...
I'm a dumb brick?

17:09.167 --> 17:10.569
I don't know orgalorg?

17:10.703 --> 17:13.257
Oh, yeah.

17:13.726 --> 17:16.132
Snaps!
He ate the comet!

17:17.041 --> 17:18.048
I got to stop him.

17:18.116 --> 17:20.396
It's too late, buddy.
It's out of our hands.

17:20.464 --> 17:21.616
Skronk that!

17:21.710 --> 17:24.900
I'm gonna use these hands
to sock him in the chops!

17:25.012 --> 17:27.111
In the chops!

17:36.428 --> 17:37.837
Hey! Dinglord!

17:37.905 --> 17:39.038
In the name of...

17:39.106 --> 17:41.884
The universe,
stop that!

17:42.600 --> 17:47.861
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

17:51.788 --> 17:53.408
Grass sword.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.228
Raaa!

17:59.212 --> 18:00.376
Huh?

18:01.199 --> 18:03.259
Yah-ta-ta-ta-ta!

18:08.159 --> 18:09.485
Whoa.

18:09.729 --> 18:12.704
I didn't open <i>this</i> door.

18:14.707 --> 18:15.974
Cool.

18:21.814 --> 18:24.478
Finn,
do you remember?

18:24.673 --> 18:26.273
Oh.

18:26.479 --> 18:27.899
Yeah, I-I think so.

18:27.985 --> 18:30.853
A long time ago,
I was you, sort of.

18:31.251 --> 18:35.024
And I crashed on earth and
became a butterfly or some biz.

18:35.110 --> 18:38.063
And I guess it was
just some random absurd thing,

18:38.188 --> 18:40.423
just a joke I've been
playing out for centuries.

18:40.527 --> 18:41.993
Who's creating the joke?

18:42.095 --> 18:43.113
Are <i>you?</i>

18:43.181 --> 18:46.392
And if so,
then are you <i>my</i> creator?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.360
Uh, maybe.
I don't know.

18:48.428 --> 18:49.470
Probably not.

18:49.540 --> 18:51.282
Probably not,
but who knows?

18:51.423 --> 18:52.931
I've been around forever

18:53.029 --> 18:55.540
and experienced
so much impossible junk.

18:55.657 --> 18:59.063
I've embodied
all that is good and evil.

18:59.286 --> 19:00.652
And now we're here.

19:00.756 --> 19:02.063
It's unprecedented.

19:02.329 --> 19:03.868
And I give you
a choice...

19:04.056 --> 19:06.902
Come with me
to the end and the beginning

19:06.970 --> 19:10.509
or struggle here awhile
like a beautiful autumn leaf.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.548
What's that bell sound?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.144
Cool, man.

19:15.212 --> 19:16.595
This is your crisis.

19:16.693 --> 19:18.798
As you stand
on the edge of freedom

19:18.866 --> 19:21.392
from love...

19:21.700 --> 19:23.000
Hate...

19:23.243 --> 19:24.587
Friendship...

19:24.670 --> 19:26.170
Isolation...

19:26.306 --> 19:27.610
Jealousy...

19:27.806 --> 19:29.140
Secrets...

19:29.368 --> 19:30.626
Violence...

19:30.841 --> 19:32.207
Video games...

19:32.493 --> 19:34.111
Ice-cream waffles...

19:34.179 --> 19:35.618
Sadness...

19:35.715 --> 19:37.165
Madness...

19:37.256 --> 19:38.622
Power...

19:38.765 --> 19:40.031
Honor...

19:40.119 --> 19:41.501
Loyalty...

19:41.652 --> 19:42.951
Saucy...

19:43.055 --> 19:44.454
Mothers...

19:44.623 --> 19:45.868
Fathers...

19:45.983 --> 19:47.219
Scoundrels.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.032
How long
are you gonna list stuff?

19:49.139 --> 19:50.696
It's a long list.

19:50.852 --> 19:52.930
You're telling me
to abandon all this stuff,

19:53.095 --> 19:55.524
but you're not really
making it sound bad.

19:55.651 --> 19:56.821
It's <i>not</i> bad.

19:56.902 --> 20:00.446
I'm just giving you the choice
of a new mode of existence.

20:01.438 --> 20:04.024
I feel like I put a lot of work
into this meat reality.

20:04.118 --> 20:05.493
I'd like
to see it through.

20:05.563 --> 20:06.745
Fair enough.

20:06.813 --> 20:09.213
Hey, how about
<i>I</i> get a new mode?

20:10.135 --> 20:12.549
Are you seriously trying
to bail out <i>again?!</i>

20:12.807 --> 20:15.713
What?
This deal sounds pretty good.

20:16.213 --> 20:17.377
Dad.

20:17.495 --> 20:19.213
Uh-oh.
I know that look.

20:19.325 --> 20:20.388
When you fled the scene

20:20.456 --> 20:22.026
like a ding-dong-ditcher
in the night...

20:22.094 --> 20:23.239
Listen, Finn.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.956
No answer I give you
will be satisfying.

20:26.049 --> 20:28.479
Besides,
it was like 40 years ago.

20:28.547 --> 20:29.731
I'm 16!

20:29.799 --> 20:32.706
I don't have a star
to revolve around to track time.

20:32.776 --> 20:34.690
Well, why do you
always run from everything?

20:34.758 --> 20:36.294
You burn enough Bridges,

20:36.362 --> 20:38.354
the only direction to move
is forward.

20:38.569 --> 20:39.682
Hm.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.745
Well, there ain't
no changing you, I guess.

20:41.831 --> 20:44.424
Well, I'm glad we finally
understand each other.

20:44.527 --> 20:46.981
Start the engine,
comet boy!

20:47.049 --> 20:48.838
Prepare
to discorporate.

20:48.971 --> 20:50.916
Goodbye, son!

20:51.081 --> 20:52.502
Bye, dad.

20:52.940 --> 20:54.463
I should have asked
for a lift home.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.159
Unh!

20:56.744 --> 20:58.061
Jake!

20:58.129 --> 20:59.362
I thought I had lost...

20:59.430 --> 21:00.596
You.

21:01.089 --> 21:02.623
Noooooo!

21:02.738 --> 21:05.172
- You okay, Finn?
- What?!

21:06.373 --> 21:08.229
Jake! Banana man?!

21:08.297 --> 21:09.348
How?

21:09.416 --> 21:10.807
I was just
floating around,

21:10.875 --> 21:13.151
and I drifted
into B-man's flight path.

21:13.257 --> 21:14.650
Pretty random, right?

21:14.807 --> 21:16.979
It-It-It wasn't random.
<i>I</i> did it.

21:17.182 --> 21:19.479
Let's get
the jazz out of here.

21:20.251 --> 21:22.419
Nooooo!

21:30.863 --> 21:32.362
There we go. See?

21:32.468 --> 21:34.534
Problem
took care of itself.

21:34.666 --> 21:36.729
You think Finn and Jake
are all right?

21:36.854 --> 21:39.205
I'd say
it's about a 50/50 chance.

21:39.354 --> 21:41.784
That's pretty much
everything in life, isn't it?

21:41.852 --> 21:43.200
Yeah. Whoa!

21:43.268 --> 21:44.893
What's that?!

21:51.270 --> 21:53.846
Hey, PB.
We took care of it.

21:54.160 --> 21:55.572
Good job, guys.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.060
Mm, I'm gonna croak
out here.

21:59.305 --> 22:05.481
