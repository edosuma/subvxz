<i>You're gonna tell us</i>
<i>everything.</i>

00:08.439 --> 00:10.972
Every terrorist cell
you and Victor helped arm,

00:10.974 --> 00:13.875
every supplier you worked with,
all your trafficking associates,

00:13.877 --> 00:16.244
everyone you've ever sold
weapons to.

00:16.245 --> 00:18.580
Chasing my brother and I
around the world for five years,

00:18.582 --> 00:21.450
like a little doggy
looking for a bone.

00:21.452 --> 00:25.120
You don't think
we'd do our homework on you?

00:31.094 --> 00:32.794
You should get that.

00:32.796 --> 00:34.529
You don't speak to your father

00:34.531 --> 00:37.666
nearly enough.

00:41.004 --> 00:42.337
Dad.

00:42.339 --> 00:45.207
Hey, champ.

00:45.742 --> 00:47.275
You all right?

00:47.277 --> 00:49.144
Who are these people, Steve?

00:49.146 --> 00:51.880
Now I know
where you get it from.

00:51.882 --> 00:53.815
You got a tough old man here.

00:53.817 --> 00:56.218
I'm offering you a trade.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.854
Your father for my brother.

00:58.856 --> 01:00.255
Come on, Victor,
you know how this works.

01:00.257 --> 01:02.491
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

01:02.493 --> 01:04.059
You kill him,

01:04.061 --> 01:05.560
you get nothing.

01:05.562 --> 01:07.262
Give me the phone.

01:07.264 --> 01:08.563
Please.

01:08.565 --> 01:09.998
I can get him

01:10.000 --> 01:12.634
to help you.
He'll listen to me.

01:12.636 --> 01:13.935
He's my son.

01:15.606 --> 01:17.873
Listen to me, champ...

01:17.875 --> 01:20.442
Dad, I'm gonna get you out
of there, all right?

01:20.444 --> 01:21.776
Don't you worry about it.

01:21.778 --> 01:23.178
I love you, son.

01:23.180 --> 01:25.213
I didn't say it enough.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.915
Whatever these
people want,

01:26.917 --> 01:29.551
Steve,

01:29.553 --> 01:31.453
don't give it to 'em.

01:31.455 --> 01:33.421
Don't you give it to them!

01:33.423 --> 01:34.556
Dad? Dad?

01:34.558 --> 01:35.590
No more games!

01:35.592 --> 01:36.791
I'm taking my brother now!

01:43.066 --> 01:44.833
This is Transport.
We are under attack. Let's go!

01:44.835 --> 01:46.835
Taking rocket and small arms
fire from hostile air.

No, no! Don't do it!

02:06.857 --> 02:08.156
Put it down!

Come on.

Come on, Anton.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.708
No! No! No!

02:46.263 --> 02:47.529
Put Anton on the phone.

02:49.466 --> 02:50.432
My brother's dead,

02:50.434 --> 02:52.334
isn't he?

02:52.336 --> 02:54.336
Victor, listen...
Isn't he?!

02:58.342 --> 03:00.008
Then so is your father.

03:00.944 --> 03:04.012
No!

03:10.887 --> 03:13.288
Commander McGarrett?

03:13.290 --> 03:16.091
Hello?

03:16.093 --> 03:18.493
Is-is my father dead?

03:18.495 --> 03:21.563
No, he's alive,
and he's gonna be fine.

03:22.866 --> 03:25.400
Who am I talking to?

03:25.402 --> 03:27.469
This is Detective
Danny Williams.

03:27.471 --> 03:29.304
Thank you, Detective Williams.
 Easy.

03:29.306 --> 03:31.373
Can I speak to my father,
please?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.608
Yeah, of course. John.

03:39.616 --> 03:42.117
Hello, son.

03:42.119 --> 03:44.319
Dad.

Hey!

Johnny Moreau!

06:08.799 --> 06:10.832
Thanks for coming.

06:10.834 --> 06:14.035
You got five minutes.
Why couldn't we meet

06:14.037 --> 06:15.203
at your place, huh?

06:15.205 --> 06:16.237
I haven't been home
in months.

06:16.239 --> 06:17.906
Cops are looking for my ass.

06:17.908 --> 06:19.407
Mmm. Boy, in those pants,

06:19.409 --> 06:21.676
I can see why.
Brah,

06:21.678 --> 06:24.012
I think you spent a little
too much time in the joint.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.781
Ah, you know, just trying
to break the ice

06:26.783 --> 06:28.349
before we talk business.

06:28.351 --> 06:30.418
Business?

06:30.420 --> 06:34.255
After you walked out of Halawa,
I figured you'd be long gone.

06:34.257 --> 06:35.723
You know, still looking
for my ticket

06:35.725 --> 06:38.359
out of paradise,
which is why I asked you here.

06:38.361 --> 06:41.095
I thought you
could help me.

06:41.097 --> 06:42.764
Help you?

06:42.766 --> 06:43.998
Now, why would I do that?

06:44.000 --> 06:48.002
Because you stole my business,
for one thing.

06:48.004 --> 06:49.004
Brutha,

06:49.005 --> 06:51.272
Five-O put you out of business,

06:51.274 --> 06:52.740
not me.

06:52.742 --> 06:54.676
I just picked up the pieces.

06:54.678 --> 06:58.079
So you're just a roadkill-eating
vulture, is that it?

06:58.081 --> 06:59.147
Brutha?

06:59.149 --> 07:01.482
I saw an opportunity,

07:01.484 --> 07:03.017
and I took it.

07:03.019 --> 07:06.554
That's not to say I don't owe
you a debt of gratitude.

07:06.556 --> 07:10.458
That's why I'm here in person,
face-to-face.

07:10.460 --> 07:14.863
But for my services,
there is a price.

07:16.333 --> 07:19.434
Well, I figured you'd say that.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.183
Sang Min!

07:35.185 --> 07:37.218
Five-O!

07:37.220 --> 07:38.786
Give me the iron.

07:38.788 --> 07:39.821
Do it.

07:39.823 --> 07:41.990
Now.

07:45.862 --> 07:48.796
Get on your knees.
Hands on your head.

07:53.003 --> 07:56.004
Johnny Moreau,
you are under arrest

07:56.006 --> 07:59.540
for human trafficking,
promoting prostitution,

07:59.542 --> 08:01.910
kidnapping...
That rat set me up.

08:01.912 --> 08:04.879
I'm no rat. I'm Five-O.
Newly minted.

08:04.881 --> 08:06.581
Kicking ass
and taking names.

08:06.583 --> 08:07.916
No, you're a rat.

08:07.918 --> 08:09.284
Shut your mouth.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.292
Can I see my family now?

08:17.294 --> 08:19.994
No. What did I tell you
last week when we found you?

08:19.996 --> 08:20.996
You didn't find me.

08:20.997 --> 08:22.997
I made myself available
for negotiation.

08:22.999 --> 08:24.265
You were hiding

08:24.267 --> 08:25.500
in a hole in Ka'a'awa

08:25.502 --> 08:27.468
that made Saddam's ditch look
like a palace.

08:27.470 --> 08:30.171
- It's called communing with nature.
- No, it's called

08:30.173 --> 08:31.973
poison ivy on your ass
for lack of TP.

08:31.975 --> 08:33.707
Oh, I missed you, Spicy.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.176
Detective Williams.

08:39.582 --> 08:41.749
Okay.

08:43.086 --> 08:44.852
All right,
we'll be right there.

08:44.854 --> 08:46.654
What's up?

08:52.796 --> 08:55.630
Hey! I got blood in the car.

08:55.632 --> 08:58.333
Looks like it could be spatter
from a gunshot wound.

08:58.335 --> 09:00.168
Still not picking up.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.939
Here's why.

09:04.941 --> 09:06.074
We should check the hospitals.

09:06.076 --> 09:07.842
Got it.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

09:10.146 --> 09:13.047
- Somebody took him.
- What?

09:13.049 --> 09:15.783
Look at these tire tracks.
Somebody took Steve.

09:20.423 --> 09:22.623
Hey!

09:30.100 --> 09:31.632
Dad! Dad!

09:31.634 --> 09:34.068
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad!

09:34.070 --> 09:36.037
Dad, look what I found.

09:36.039 --> 09:37.972
That's the best one yet,
Steve.

09:37.974 --> 09:39.707
Wow.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.309
What do you think?

09:41.311 --> 09:44.278
Yeah, Mary likes it, too.
Show your mom.

09:44.280 --> 09:47.548
What do you think, Mom?

10:29.683 --> 10:31.082
No!

10:32.552 --> 10:34.252
Hello, son. Hey, champ.

10:34.254 --> 10:35.486
Dad! Dad!

10:35.488 --> 10:37.322
What do you think, Mom?

10:40.093 --> 10:42.126
Come on, man.
Wh-Where's the aloha?

10:42.128 --> 10:44.162
Sir, I'm sorry about your golf gear.
Golf g...

10:44.164 --> 10:45.296
Man, this ain't no golf gear.

10:45.298 --> 10:47.699
I had these clubs made special
for me.

10:47.701 --> 10:49.767
There ain't another set in the
world like it. Now, you need

10:49.769 --> 10:51.569
to find the joker that stole 'em
out of my car,

10:51.571 --> 10:52.904
'cause I'm telling you something
right now,

10:52.906 --> 10:56.207
I'm not going back to Chicago
without my clubs.

10:56.209 --> 10:58.543
Sir, if you'll just take a seat, I'll
get someone to take your report.

10:58.545 --> 11:00.778
Take a re... Why you wasting
time taking reports, man?

11:00.780 --> 11:02.814
You could be out
finding my clubs.

11:02.816 --> 11:04.482
I got a tee time.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:04.484 --> 11:06.184
Commander?
Yes.

11:06.186 --> 11:08.720
Can I help you?
Yes, sir. Uh, my name's McGarrett.

11:08.722 --> 11:10.088
I'm looking for my father.

11:10.090 --> 11:11.789
Commander McGarrett.

11:11.791 --> 11:13.725
Aloha.

11:13.727 --> 11:15.193
Detective Williams.
We spoke on the phone.

11:15.195 --> 11:16.461
It's nice to see you.
Yes.

11:16.463 --> 11:18.062
Thank you.
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

11:18.064 --> 11:20.732
Mahalo. We say "mahalo"
around here, right, Duke?

11:20.734 --> 11:22.367
Mahalo.

11:22.369 --> 11:24.335
Could I... could I see my dad?

11:24.337 --> 11:26.671
Of course. Of course. He's in
a debrief with the captain.

11:26.673 --> 11:27.805
Come on.

11:27.807 --> 11:30.041
Hey, Cap.
Hey.

11:35.448 --> 11:38.383
Dad.

11:41.554 --> 11:43.221
Dad.

11:45.859 --> 11:47.692
Welcome home, son.

11:47.694 --> 11:49.027
You all right?

11:49.029 --> 11:50.895
Yeah.
Huh?

11:51.865 --> 11:56.234
Steve, uh, I want you
to meet Captain Kelly.

11:56.236 --> 11:58.369
Commander.
How do you do?

11:58.371 --> 12:01.005
He was a trainee under me,
and I'm proud to say

12:01.007 --> 12:03.041
he's going to be
the next chief of police.

12:03.043 --> 12:05.209
What can I say?
I learned from the best.

12:05.211 --> 12:07.211
Yes, you did.

12:08.448 --> 12:09.947
Where's Victor Hesse?

12:09.949 --> 12:12.283
He, uh... he's on lockdown
at the hospital right now.

12:12.285 --> 12:13.851
He say anything?

12:13.853 --> 12:16.321
Well, as per your request,
we're leaving that to you.

12:16.323 --> 12:17.555
Steve, what's going on?

12:17.557 --> 12:19.023
The only people who knew

12:19.025 --> 12:21.759
I was transporting his brother
were the men in my detail.

12:21.761 --> 12:22.994
All right, there is no way

12:22.996 --> 12:26.731
that Victor could have found out
unless he had help.

12:54.227 --> 12:56.961
Who are you?

13:03.436 --> 13:06.471
Eat this.

13:06.473 --> 13:07.873
With the chemicals
we're giving you,

13:07.874 --> 13:10.475
you're going to need to
keep your blood sugar up.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.493
You going to tell me
what the hell is going on here?!

13:28.495 --> 13:29.727
What do you want?

13:29.729 --> 13:31.763
What do you want from me?

13:32.599 --> 13:34.465
What have I done to you?

13:35.468 --> 13:37.835
What are you doing?

13:38.805 --> 13:42.173
I'm a cop, you know that?

13:42.175 --> 13:45.576
I'm a cop. They're gonna
come looking for me.

13:51.651 --> 13:54.886
They're watching us.

13:54.888 --> 13:55.920
Everywhere.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.322
Can't you see?

13:58.324 --> 13:59.824
No. Stop!

13:59.826 --> 14:01.793
You can't do that. Stop!

14:01.795 --> 14:03.628
No, I won't... I won't let you.
Stop! Get-get away!

14:03.630 --> 14:05.897
Get away! Stop! No.
Yeah.

14:05.899 --> 14:08.399
- Aah! Get away! Get away!
- Well, I guess if

14:08.401 --> 14:10.802
you're gonna be homeless,
this is the place to be, right?

14:10.804 --> 14:12.336
I guess so.

14:16.776 --> 14:18.776
Excuse me.

14:18.778 --> 14:20.745
Hey, baby doll.

14:20.747 --> 14:22.814
Huh?

14:24.350 --> 14:26.451
I know. I know.

14:26.453 --> 14:27.785
Hey, look, uh, I'm
just, uh... I'm just

14:27.787 --> 14:29.754
in the middle of something.
Can I call you back?

14:31.224 --> 14:33.057
Okay. I love you, too.

14:33.059 --> 14:34.792
See you in a bit.

14:35.862 --> 14:37.528
I take it you're married.

14:37.530 --> 14:40.064
Yes, yes, very.
Very married.

14:40.066 --> 14:41.566
I got lucky.
Pretty much the greatest

14:41.568 --> 14:43.000
woman on the planet, you know?

14:43.002 --> 14:44.035
Right on. That's something.

14:44.037 --> 14:45.069
Yeah.
What's her name?

14:45.071 --> 14:46.471
Rachel.

14:46.473 --> 14:47.772
Yeah? You got kids?

14:47.774 --> 14:49.740
I do, yeah. One
little girl. Grace.

14:49.742 --> 14:51.676
How about you?

14:51.678 --> 14:53.110
I'm seeing somebody.

14:53.112 --> 14:54.378
I mean, hopefully, we'll...

14:54.380 --> 14:55.844
Hopefully, we'll get there
one day, you know?

14:55.868 --> 14:56.648
Yeah.

14:56.649 --> 14:58.216
It's the best, man.

14:58.218 --> 15:00.451
Actually, my dad said you just
moved here a couple months ago.

15:00.453 --> 15:01.719
Is that right?
Yeah, yeah.

15:01.721 --> 15:03.020
What brought you to Oahu?

15:03.022 --> 15:05.356
I don't know. What
didn't bring me to Oahu?

15:05.358 --> 15:06.891
I mean, we got
beautiful beaches,

15:06.893 --> 15:08.593
you got sunshine
all the time.

15:08.595 --> 15:10.294
Got <i> Ono</i> eats.

15:10.296 --> 15:11.596
Place is fantastic.

15:11.598 --> 15:13.631
It's like heaven compared
to New Jersey, you know?

15:13.633 --> 15:15.566
Can you please help
me find someone?

15:15.568 --> 15:16.968
No one will
tell me anything.

15:16.970 --> 15:18.336
His name is Josh.

15:18.338 --> 15:19.904
The police said that
he was in a bicycle accident.

15:19.906 --> 15:21.606
If you could just tell me
what room he's in.

15:21.608 --> 15:22.940
Are you family?

15:22.942 --> 15:24.675
He's my fiancé.

15:34.988 --> 15:36.754
If you're like me,
you spend a lot of time

15:36.756 --> 15:39.724
<i>in the sand and surf,</i>
<i>and that can dry out your lips.</i>

15:39.726 --> 15:41.659
So whether it's the North Shore

15:41.661 --> 15:42.960
<i>or city breaks,</i>

15:42.962 --> 15:46.297
I never hit the waves
without my Surf Kiss Lip Gloss.

15:46.299 --> 15:49.200
It gives my lips
that surf-kissed,

15:49.202 --> 15:51.269
want-to-be-kissed look.

15:53.039 --> 15:56.574
<i>Take it from four-time</i>
<i>world champion, Kono Kalakaua.</i>

15:56.576 --> 15:58.976
Don't forget your Surf Kiss.

15:58.978 --> 16:01.145
Hey.

16:01.147 --> 16:03.648
I was enjoying that.
I'm glad that you were enjoying it,

16:03.650 --> 16:05.750
'cause that's probably
the closest you will ever be

16:05.752 --> 16:08.085
to a pretty woman
for the rest of your life.

16:09.255 --> 16:11.155
You underestimate
my resources, Detective.

16:11.157 --> 16:13.124
You'd be surprised
what a man can do

16:13.126 --> 16:15.026
with the right friends
in the right places.

16:15.028 --> 16:16.661
Well, that's...

16:16.663 --> 16:18.796
That's why we're here, to talk
about one of those friends.

16:18.798 --> 16:21.832
Specifically the man who
ordered you to kill my father.

16:21.834 --> 16:24.835
Maybe I came up with that
on my own.

16:24.837 --> 16:28.472
Maybe I wanted to bury your
father just because I could.

16:28.474 --> 16:31.375
Right. Yeah, you see,
I know you loved your brother,

16:31.377 --> 16:33.644
but I also know
that you didn't come up

16:33.646 --> 16:35.046
with that all by yourself.

16:35.048 --> 16:38.349
You got entry
into this country.

16:38.351 --> 16:41.052
You got our comm links,
you got my extraction route.

16:41.054 --> 16:43.955
Now, that came with a price,
and that was my father's murder.

16:43.957 --> 16:45.356
Right?

16:45.358 --> 16:47.925
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I
won't answer any questions

16:47.927 --> 16:49.360
until I've retained counsel.

16:49.362 --> 16:50.595
Oh.

16:50.597 --> 16:52.063
You won't answer the questions.

16:52.065 --> 16:53.831
Look. I-I personally love it

16:53.833 --> 16:55.666
when a guy with a foreign
accent tells me to beat it.

16:55.668 --> 16:58.035
It just sounds so
much nicer, you know?

16:58.037 --> 16:59.737
Let's go, let's go.
No, no, no. Whoa.

16:59.739 --> 17:01.739
Whoa, whoa. What does this do?

17:02.909 --> 17:05.409
You can't do that.

17:05.411 --> 17:06.911
You can't do that.
He's right. You can't do that.

17:06.913 --> 17:08.779
No, no, no, you see,
I <i> can</i> do that, huh? Right?

17:08.781 --> 17:10.548
Because Bono here
is not a U.S. citizen.

17:10.550 --> 17:11.915
That means
he is not

17:11.917 --> 17:14.185
subject to our
constitutional protections.

17:15.655 --> 17:17.887
Listen, you're...
you're incorrect. Okay?

17:17.890 --> 17:19.790
He-he's been
arrested on U.S. soil.

17:19.791 --> 17:21.592
He's allowed those rights.
You-you know that,

17:21.594 --> 17:22.993
right?

17:22.996 --> 17:24.462
He doesn't know that.
Lock the door.

17:24.464 --> 17:26.163
Lock the door?
Never mind.

17:26.165 --> 17:27.765
What?

17:29.802 --> 17:32.136
Hey, hey! Shh.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.270
Shh.

17:33.272 --> 17:34.605
What the hell is
going on in here?

17:34.607 --> 17:35.973
Hey, don't be rude.

17:35.975 --> 17:37.608
We're obviously having
a conversation here. Leave.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.276
Hold this pillow, would you?
Huh?

17:39.278 --> 17:40.811
Do me a favor.
Also, while you're out there,

17:40.813 --> 17:42.880
call the coroner and tell him
to get a table ready.

17:42.882 --> 17:44.649
Okay, no, stop, stop.

17:44.651 --> 17:46.083
What?
What kind of cop are you?

17:46.085 --> 17:47.685
The kind of cop
that gets things done.

17:47.687 --> 17:49.153
Excuse me.
Hey. Shh, shh, shh.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.088
Hey, look at me. Right here.
Look at me, right here.

17:51.090 --> 17:52.023
Right here...
That's enough.

17:52.025 --> 17:53.057
Huh?
Enough, enough.

17:53.059 --> 17:54.125
Enough?
Enough, yeah.

17:54.127 --> 17:55.159
No. No.
It's not enough, okay?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.293
You told me this man
is a terrorist.

17:56.295 --> 17:57.762
9/11, I was there.

17:57.764 --> 17:58.896
I was in New
York City, okay?

17:58.898 --> 18:01.699
So this guy gets no
mercy from me, okay?

18:01.701 --> 18:03.634
Whoa!

18:03.636 --> 18:05.136
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:05.138 --> 18:06.404
I'm sorry.
I didn't ask you the question.

18:06.406 --> 18:07.405
It's not... My bad.

18:07.407 --> 18:08.606
Hey! Open up!

18:08.608 --> 18:09.740
What's going on in there?
Whoa, whoa.

18:09.742 --> 18:11.042
Hey.
What?

18:11.044 --> 18:12.576
Don't unlock the door.
Do not unlock that door.

18:12.578 --> 18:14.278
If you don't like
what I'm doing, you can wait

18:14.280 --> 18:15.446
in the toilet, okay?

18:15.448 --> 18:18.282
This man, he tried to execute
your father yesterday.

18:18.284 --> 18:19.817
All right? And I don't
think he's going to talk

18:19.819 --> 18:20.951
without a little
friendly persuasion.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.086
Open up!

18:22.088 --> 18:24.922
Hey! Give us a minute, please!

18:24.924 --> 18:25.890
Hmm?

18:29.295 --> 18:30.628
Hmm?
Do whatever you gotta do.

18:30.630 --> 18:31.962
Thank you.

18:31.964 --> 18:33.898
Wait. Wait.
What?

18:33.900 --> 18:35.166
I'll tell you what
you want to know.

18:35.168 --> 18:37.201
Who told you about my op?

18:37.203 --> 18:40.538
If I tell you,

18:40.540 --> 18:42.673
you're going to wish I hadn't.

18:42.675 --> 18:44.008
Yeah?

18:44.010 --> 18:45.309
I'll take that chance.

18:45.311 --> 18:46.844
Who told you about my op?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.573
Good.

19:15.575 --> 19:18.142
You're up.

19:26.686 --> 19:27.985
Let's begin.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.871
You're never gonna break me.

19:55.677 --> 19:57.477
Behavioral engineering works,
Steve.

19:58.981 --> 20:00.647
You know that.

20:03.385 --> 20:05.018
It just takes time.

20:23.939 --> 20:25.472
Now, tell me...

20:25.474 --> 20:28.341
where's my father?

20:30.045 --> 20:32.212
I don't know.

20:34.049 --> 20:35.382
You expect me to believe that?

20:37.052 --> 20:39.085
No.

20:39.955 --> 20:42.122
But it's the truth.

20:48.463 --> 20:49.829
Well, where's
my office gonna be?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.731
Say something stupid again
and I'll shoot you.

20:51.733 --> 20:53.133
Ooh, Spicy...

20:53.135 --> 20:55.168
Sorry.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.970
Oh, we meet again
so soon, huh?

21:00.108 --> 21:02.108
Why's he up there?

21:02.110 --> 21:03.677
We believe that Wo Fat

21:03.679 --> 21:05.245
abducted McGarrett this morning.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.113
Oh, and you think
I know where he is?

21:07.115 --> 21:08.682
No, you're too low
on the food chain

21:08.684 --> 21:09.983
to be on
his radar.

21:11.286 --> 21:12.619
Kick a man when he's down, huh?

21:12.621 --> 21:14.087
All right, cut it out.

21:14.089 --> 21:15.288
Think. Think hard.

21:15.290 --> 21:16.623
Associates.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.925
Anyone with the resources
who would be able to help Wo Fat

21:18.927 --> 21:21.061
pull this off.

21:36.345 --> 21:37.978
Hey.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.212
What's going on?

21:39.214 --> 21:40.981
Do you know Anthony Shu?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.950
No.

21:43.952 --> 21:45.051
Are you sure?

21:45.053 --> 21:46.052
He's supposedly
an investor

21:46.054 --> 21:47.621
in one of your
father's companies.

21:47.623 --> 21:48.755
Kono, I don't
know the name

21:48.757 --> 21:49.990
of every one of
our investors.

21:49.992 --> 21:51.552
What does this have
to do with anything?

21:53.695 --> 21:56.162
We think Wo Fat abducted
McGarrett this morning.

21:57.799 --> 21:59.933
Sang Min says he uses
the alias Anthony Shu

21:59.935 --> 22:02.569
to do business
in the United States.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.104
Okay, um...

22:04.106 --> 22:06.006
I'll go to the office,
get everything I can.

22:06.008 --> 22:07.674
Okay. Thanks.

22:15.784 --> 22:17.350
This can end

22:17.352 --> 22:19.419
if you just tell me
what I want to know.

22:24.126 --> 22:27.227
If you're gonna kill me,

22:27.229 --> 22:29.429
just do it.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.734
Steve, if I wanted

22:34.736 --> 22:37.137
to kill you, I would have
done it long ago.

22:39.841 --> 22:42.008
Think about it.

22:47.049 --> 22:48.615
Okay.

22:50.085 --> 22:53.053
You want to know
where your father is, yeah?

22:54.089 --> 22:55.855
Ask Doris.

22:57.426 --> 23:01.094
I know about her trips
to Colorado to come see you.

23:02.431 --> 23:04.064
You should have
asked her when you

23:04.066 --> 23:06.533
had the chance.

23:06.535 --> 23:08.835
I asked
<i>our</i> mother.

23:09.938 --> 23:11.538
She said she
didn't know.

23:15.077 --> 23:17.711
What did you say?

23:20.182 --> 23:21.414
You just said "our mother."

23:21.416 --> 23:23.083
What do you mean
by "our mother"?

23:24.619 --> 23:27.387
She's not your mother.

23:29.057 --> 23:30.490
I ran the DNA, okay?

23:30.492 --> 23:32.058
I ran the DNA.

23:33.328 --> 23:36.196
She's not your
mother, all right?

23:37.499 --> 23:39.099
Aah!

23:40.068 --> 23:41.534
Aah!

23:44.106 --> 23:45.538
What are you giving me?

23:47.042 --> 23:49.642
What...

23:49.644 --> 23:51.745
What are you giving me?

23:51.747 --> 23:54.280
Something to help you
tell the truth.

24:13.068 --> 24:16.536
Authorities have identified
the victim as Doris McGarrett,

24:16.538 --> 24:18.805
a local schoolteacher
and also the wife

24:18.807 --> 24:21.074
to Honolulu Police Sergeant
John McGarrett.

24:21.076 --> 24:22.709
Now Mrs. McGarrett leaves behind

24:22.711 --> 24:24.177
two young children.

24:24.179 --> 24:26.379
HPD officials say
they will be investigating

24:26.381 --> 24:27.947
this tragic incident,

24:27.949 --> 24:31.117
which has left one Aina Haina
family in mourning.

24:38.627 --> 24:40.994
No, no, no, no, no.

24:40.996 --> 24:42.829
No.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.108
Yeah, copy that. Thank you.

24:55.110 --> 24:57.544
Okay, so my sources
never heard of a Wo Fat.

24:57.546 --> 24:58.978
Okay, all right,
I mean, I just...

24:58.980 --> 25:01.314
You know, who would make up
a name like Wo Fat?

25:01.316 --> 25:03.450
Well, I mean, you-you
put two holes in the man--

25:03.452 --> 25:05.318
he would've said anything
to get you to stop, right?

25:05.320 --> 25:08.254
Look, um, I'm-I'm pretty sure
that your Navy buddies,

25:08.256 --> 25:09.989
uh, they're up to
speed on everything,

25:09.991 --> 25:11.858
but if it happens
here on this island,

25:11.860 --> 25:13.426
there's one man to talk to.

25:27.075 --> 25:28.975
This better be good.

25:28.977 --> 25:30.910
You're interrupting my lunch.

25:32.013 --> 25:33.346
I'm sure all the
other inmates

25:33.348 --> 25:34.781
are happy about that.

25:35.650 --> 25:36.950
What are you intimating?

25:36.952 --> 25:40.420
By missing a meal, everyone
in this place will eat?

25:40.422 --> 25:42.856
And if I don't, they starve?

25:44.559 --> 25:46.926
Sure... Uh, lighten
up, would you?

25:46.928 --> 25:48.461
Why don't you shut up?

25:50.732 --> 25:53.266
And who are you?

25:53.268 --> 25:54.567
Strippergram?

25:54.569 --> 25:56.669
Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett.

25:56.671 --> 25:59.572
And what do you want, Commander?

25:59.574 --> 26:02.976
Well, Detective Williams here
told me you might

26:02.978 --> 26:05.278
know where we can find
a man named Wo Fat.

26:05.280 --> 26:06.813
Try hell.

26:06.815 --> 26:09.149
Yeah? Any stops along the way?

26:09.151 --> 26:11.050
What's in it for me?

26:11.052 --> 26:13.753
What do you want?

26:14.489 --> 26:17.557
Fresh shrimp. Twice a week.

26:17.559 --> 26:19.759
I'm tired of the Spam.

26:21.129 --> 26:22.595
Okay.

26:24.399 --> 26:25.498
There you go.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.033
Done.

26:27.035 --> 26:28.501
Now tell us where to find him.

26:38.079 --> 26:39.979
My father.

26:39.981 --> 26:41.714
Where is he?

26:46.021 --> 26:48.488
I already told you.
I don't know.

26:48.490 --> 26:50.690
Very well.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.027
No, no, no, no.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.262
Aah!

27:13.682 --> 27:17.350
I can't tell you what...

27:17.352 --> 27:19.586
what I don't know...

27:19.588 --> 27:23.122
What I don't know.

28:26.488 --> 28:29.355
Why try to kill my father?

28:32.360 --> 28:34.394
What did he ever do to you?!

28:38.567 --> 28:41.701
What'd he ever do to you?

29:00.855 --> 29:03.523
Commander?

29:03.525 --> 29:05.158
Hey.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.160
Look, I know you know
that this is Hawaii,

29:07.162 --> 29:08.928
but, uh, we usually
don't wear uniforms

29:08.930 --> 29:10.263
unless we're going
to a ceremony.

29:10.265 --> 29:12.799
See?
I'm, uh, heading out.

29:12.801 --> 29:15.635
Well, that's, uh, that's
too bad, you know?

29:15.637 --> 29:17.337
'Cause I was thinking
about what we did.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.838
I thought maybe, uh,
you'd be interested

29:18.840 --> 29:20.607
in a career in
law enforcement.

29:20.609 --> 29:22.508
What do you say?
"A career in law enforcement"?

29:22.510 --> 29:23.843
That's right, yeah.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.713
Um, I don't know.
Maybe, maybe someday.

29:26.715 --> 29:27.880
All right, well,
you think about it.

29:27.882 --> 29:29.415
You ever get homesick,
uh, I'll put in

29:29.417 --> 29:30.883
a word with Captain
Kelly and maybe, uh,

29:30.885 --> 29:32.352
put you to work.
What do you think?

29:32.354 --> 29:33.620
Tell you what.
I could, uh,

29:33.622 --> 29:34.921
I could get used
to be being chauffeured

29:34.923 --> 29:36.055
around all day,
that's for sure.

29:36.057 --> 29:37.123
That's right.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.524
See you around, Danny.

29:38.526 --> 29:39.659
Hey! Danno.

29:39.661 --> 29:41.594
Call me Danno. All my
friends do, all right?

29:41.596 --> 29:42.596
All right, Danno.

29:42.597 --> 29:44.097
Safe flight, buddy. Okay?

29:44.099 --> 29:46.366
All right.
All right, take care.

29:56.745 --> 30:00.313
Navy's taught you well.

30:00.315 --> 30:02.515
You son of...

30:04.853 --> 30:08.521
I'm gonna kill you.

30:08.523 --> 30:11.491
And then I'm gonna
find your father.

30:11.493 --> 30:13.926
I'm gonna kill him
just for having you.

30:13.928 --> 30:17.664
Then you're going to have
to kill your mother, too.

30:17.666 --> 30:18.898
What are you talking about?!

30:18.900 --> 30:20.133
Your mother is more responsible

30:20.135 --> 30:21.300
for who I am today.

30:21.302 --> 30:23.569
Stop talking in circles!

30:44.793 --> 30:47.927
You know nothing about
the real Doris McGarrett.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.830
Do you?

30:52.133 --> 30:54.300
I know...

30:57.439 --> 31:00.540
...that she was assigned
to kill your father.

31:03.411 --> 31:06.913
But instead your mother
died in that op.

31:07.916 --> 31:10.083
Yes.

31:11.086 --> 31:14.654
And she never forgave
herself for murdering

31:14.656 --> 31:17.457
an innocent woman

31:17.459 --> 31:20.727
who had just become
a new mother.

31:20.729 --> 31:23.329
That pain

31:23.331 --> 31:25.364
and anguish

31:25.366 --> 31:29.535
caused her to do
something quite...

31:29.537 --> 31:31.738
remarkable.

31:34.175 --> 31:36.843
She took in that child

31:36.845 --> 31:39.378
and raised it as her own

31:39.380 --> 31:42.949
for several years.

31:44.486 --> 31:47.353
Until her superiors
discovered this...

31:48.690 --> 31:51.457
...and forced her...

31:56.264 --> 31:59.365
They forced her to abandon

31:59.367 --> 32:02.969
that child.

32:07.475 --> 32:09.642
That was you.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.717
You see?

32:20.054 --> 32:23.055
Doris McGarrett...

32:23.057 --> 32:27.126
was my mother, too.

32:36.571 --> 32:39.539
If Doris knew
where my father was,

32:39.541 --> 32:42.375
she would've told me.

32:42.377 --> 32:46.112
But with your persistence,

32:46.114 --> 32:48.281
I can't help but believe

32:48.283 --> 32:51.284
you know where your government
is holding him.

32:53.521 --> 32:56.155
I don't.

32:56.157 --> 32:58.424
That may be true.

33:02.664 --> 33:05.198
But I need to be convinced.

33:14.342 --> 33:16.475
I'm telling you the truth.

33:17.979 --> 33:22.481
I don't know
where your father is.

37:43.363 --> 37:45.463
Hey.

37:45.465 --> 37:47.498
Hey, you can't be back here.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.420
Okay, it's fine.
Everything's fine. Everything...

37:50.903 --> 37:52.069
Come on.

38:37.784 --> 38:40.051
You're not going to kill me.

38:40.053 --> 38:42.086
Are you?

38:42.088 --> 38:44.255
Brother?

38:47.360 --> 38:49.527
You're not my brother.

38:54.267 --> 38:57.368
I miss this view.

38:58.271 --> 39:00.337
Mmm.

39:02.642 --> 39:05.676
I'm glad you're home, son.

39:06.713 --> 39:08.913
Me, too, Dad.

39:24.063 --> 39:25.796
Steve?

39:30.803 --> 39:32.937
Steve, you all right?

39:32.939 --> 39:33.939
Hey!

39:33.940 --> 39:36.340
Come on.

39:36.342 --> 39:38.309
You all right?

39:38.311 --> 39:40.478
Huh? You all right?

39:41.514 --> 39:43.514
Yeah.

39:43.516 --> 39:45.483
Yeah, where's my father?

39:45.485 --> 39:47.184
Where's my father?

39:47.186 --> 39:48.986
I want to
see my dad.

39:48.988 --> 39:50.955
I want
to see my dad.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.727
Buddy, your dad died
four years ago, okay?

40:03.970 --> 40:05.936
All right?

40:05.938 --> 40:08.139
Yeah, yeah.

40:11.878 --> 40:13.477
You're all right.

40:13.479 --> 40:14.445
You're all right.

40:14.447 --> 40:15.613
I'm good.

40:18.818 --> 40:19.784
L-Let's go.

40:19.786 --> 40:21.085
All right?
Yeah, let's go.

40:21.087 --> 40:22.520
Let's get out
of here.

40:26.325 --> 40:27.424
All right?

40:27.426 --> 40:29.160
Yeah.

40:31.798 --> 40:34.799
Wait, wait.

40:46.279 --> 40:48.445
Let's go.

40:49.282 --> 40:51.448
Come on, man.
