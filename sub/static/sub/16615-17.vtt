00:00.075 --> 00:02.697
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...

00:02.711 --> 00:05.208
A sleeping curse? That's
never kept us apart before.

00:05.547 --> 00:07.180
You stole me from my parents.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.615
They abandoned you!

00:08.650 --> 00:12.419
You may have stopped me, but
you can't stop The Savior.

00:13.588 --> 00:15.155
Now you are mine.

00:15.190 --> 00:16.556
Emma, are you there?

00:16.591 --> 00:18.391
I was on my way back
to you, and Gideon...

00:18.427 --> 00:20.126
He wanted me out of the way.

00:22.364 --> 00:23.330
Who are they?

00:23.365 --> 00:24.297
The Lost Boys.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.332
Where are we?

00:25.367 --> 00:26.700
Neverland.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.078 --> 00:37.210
Get the pirate!

00:37.245 --> 00:38.845
Make him pay!

00:44.591 --> 00:45.990
Over there!

00:59.939 --> 01:03.107
Oh, bloody hell.

01:03.143 --> 01:04.775
Look, I've got... I've got treasure

01:04.811 --> 01:06.044
buried all over this island

01:06.079 --> 01:07.879
and, uh... and rum.

01:07.914 --> 01:09.380
Any of you lads old enough to drink rum?

01:09.416 --> 01:11.916
There's only one thing
we want from you...

01:11.951 --> 01:14.652
to make you pay for
what happened to Pan.

01:14.688 --> 01:16.688
Aye?

01:17.724 --> 01:18.890
Well, let's get on with it then.

01:18.925 --> 01:20.491
I've got somebody
waiting for me at home.

01:20.527 --> 01:21.993
Now, look, I don't
want to hurt any of you,

01:22.028 --> 01:24.228
so this is your last chance.

01:24.264 --> 01:26.731
Ugh!

01:33.606 --> 01:36.040
You should really be
more careful, Captain.

01:41.047 --> 01:44.248
The Lost Boys have gotten
nasty since Pan died.

01:44.284 --> 01:45.866
Tiger Lily.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.954
Didn't expect to ever
see you back on this rock.

01:49.989 --> 01:51.155
Neither did I.

01:51.191 --> 01:54.392
This isn't exactly what you
call a planned excursion.

01:54.427 --> 01:58.396
I suppose thanks are in
order for the daring rescue.

01:58.431 --> 02:00.398
Right.

02:00.433 --> 02:01.822
About that...

02:03.169 --> 02:05.151
who said this was a rescue?

02:23.189 --> 02:24.155
"The Final Battle"?

02:24.190 --> 02:25.857
According to that weasel, Isaac,

02:25.892 --> 02:28.358
that's what these hieroglyphs mean.

02:29.476 --> 02:31.062
We really are at the end of the book.

02:31.097 --> 02:32.263
We should have seen this coming.

02:32.298 --> 02:33.898
- There's no way you could.
- Yes.

02:33.933 --> 02:34.999
Back in the Enchanted Forest,

02:35.034 --> 02:36.300
when Rumplestiltskin told us

02:36.336 --> 02:37.635
you were destined to be the Savior,

02:37.670 --> 02:39.670
he said you would have
to fight the Final Battle.

02:39.706 --> 02:42.807
We thought that meant
breaking the original curse.

02:42.842 --> 02:44.308
We...

02:44.344 --> 02:46.008
We never would have put
you through that wardrobe

02:46.014 --> 02:47.545
if we knew it was gonna lead to this.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.679
And it's fine.

02:48.715 --> 02:50.581
I'm not gonna lose.

02:50.617 --> 02:51.716
Come on, kid. Let's go to the library

02:51.751 --> 02:52.817
and see if we can find
something to decipher

02:52.852 --> 02:56.087
exactly what this means.

03:00.059 --> 03:02.794
It's going to be okay, Mom.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.662
I know.

03:12.839 --> 03:15.339
Her story can't end like this.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.542
Hook's trapped in another realm.

03:17.577 --> 03:21.646
Her parents are stuck apart.

03:21.681 --> 03:23.080
She can't go into the Final Battle

03:23.116 --> 03:23.981
without her family.

03:24.017 --> 03:26.250
I agree.

03:26.286 --> 03:28.953
But unless you or Snow sleepwalk,

03:28.988 --> 03:31.322
Emma's going to have to
settle for only one Charming.

03:31.357 --> 03:33.691
Unless you break the
curse you put us under.

03:33.726 --> 03:36.527
I know, and I'm working on an antidote.

03:36.563 --> 03:39.430
This kind of magic takes time, testing,

03:39.465 --> 03:41.032
and experimenting to be sure.

03:41.067 --> 03:42.867
Testing? You have something?

03:42.902 --> 03:44.836
Okay, yes, I may have something,

03:44.871 --> 03:47.004
but it could be dangerous
or life-threatening.

03:47.040 --> 03:51.943
Our daughter is about to face
the biggest fight of her life.

03:51.978 --> 03:54.078
We'll do whatever it
takes to be with her.

03:54.113 --> 03:56.981
Now, whatever you have...

03:57.016 --> 03:58.149
it'll work.

04:00.453 --> 04:03.221
It has to.

04:03.256 --> 04:04.722
I mean, it's not like
it's the first curse

04:04.757 --> 04:06.757
we've ever woken up from.

04:23.576 --> 04:25.276
Good afternoon, Granny.

04:25.311 --> 04:26.344
It'd be a hell of a lot better

04:26.379 --> 04:27.645
if Ruby weren't still sleeping off

04:27.680 --> 04:29.080
last night's hangover.

04:29.115 --> 04:30.948
Now I'm putting out the open sign.

04:30.984 --> 04:33.517
These were supposed
to be my golden years.

04:34.822 --> 04:36.339
Hi, Marco!

04:38.691 --> 04:40.691
Look at what you've made me do.

04:40.727 --> 04:42.894
I'm sorry.

04:42.929 --> 04:44.128
Oh, hi, Dr. Hopper.

04:44.163 --> 04:45.096
Ah.

04:45.131 --> 04:46.329
Oh!

04:46.335 --> 04:47.632
Oh, sorry about Pongo.

04:47.667 --> 04:48.900
He... He's in a mood.

04:48.935 --> 04:50.968
He's off gluten.

04:51.004 --> 04:52.303
- Oh!
- Ah! Ah!

04:52.338 --> 04:54.405
Oh, I'm so sorry, Madame Mayor.

04:55.541 --> 04:57.575
What is so important that
you can't pay attention

04:57.610 --> 04:58.876
to where you're walking?

04:58.912 --> 05:00.711
Well, I was just headed to the hospital

05:00.747 --> 05:01.979
to deliver these.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.181
Oh, let me guess. For John Doe?

05:04.217 --> 05:05.816
I like to think it comforts him.

05:05.852 --> 05:07.051
I can get another bunch.

05:07.086 --> 05:09.520
Well, don't waste your money.

05:09.555 --> 05:11.656
It's not like he can
tell the difference.

05:14.127 --> 05:15.693
Has there been any news?

05:15.728 --> 05:17.495
Has anyone figured out who he is

05:17.530 --> 05:18.896
or where his family might be?

05:18.932 --> 05:21.299
I'm not sure it really matters.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.500
Why's that?

05:22.535 --> 05:25.002
Dr. Whale said it's
beginning to look like...

05:25.038 --> 05:27.104
he may never wake up.

06:00.139 --> 06:01.872
Sorry I'm late.

06:05.345 --> 06:08.179
I almost didn't come, but...

06:08.214 --> 06:09.981
then I saw this, and
something in me told me

06:10.016 --> 06:12.283
I had to bring it to you.

06:23.296 --> 06:24.996
Oh, no.

06:25.031 --> 06:26.564
What's happening? What have I done?

06:34.140 --> 06:35.539
Snow.

06:35.575 --> 06:38.042
Snow. Oh, no, I don't understand.

06:38.077 --> 06:39.652
Where is she?

06:40.913 --> 06:42.813
N-N-No! Oh!

06:42.849 --> 06:43.814
Where is the Evil Queen?

06:43.850 --> 06:45.416
No. Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:45.451 --> 06:47.284
You've... You're confused.
You've been in a coma.

06:49.655 --> 06:51.255
The Evil Queen's
guards... They stabbed me.

06:51.290 --> 06:53.357
I-I passed out, and then...

06:53.393 --> 06:56.193
The curse must have brought us here,

06:56.229 --> 06:57.161
whatever this place is.

06:57.196 --> 06:59.263
I'm gonna go get a doctor.

06:59.298 --> 07:00.498
All right.

07:00.533 --> 07:01.832
Whatever she did to you,

07:01.868 --> 07:04.668
I know Snow White is in there somewhere.

07:04.704 --> 07:06.305
- Trust me.
- You are delusional

07:06.311 --> 07:08.406
and speaking gibberish.
Why would I trust you?

07:08.441 --> 07:11.809
Because you love me and I love you.

07:11.844 --> 07:13.544
Come on.

07:13.579 --> 07:16.747
Somewhere inside, you know that.

07:31.531 --> 07:33.664
Charming.

07:33.699 --> 07:35.199
There you are.

07:35.234 --> 07:36.534
Oh!

07:45.344 --> 07:46.644
Are you sure you don't want to tell Emma

07:46.679 --> 07:48.512
- what you're doing?
- Well, we know what she would say.

07:48.548 --> 07:50.614
She wouldn't let us take the risk.

07:50.650 --> 07:51.782
I agree with David.

07:51.818 --> 07:53.651
We have to do this now.

07:56.289 --> 07:57.788
So, how does this work?

07:57.824 --> 08:00.958
Sorry, but this is going to hurt.

08:06.833 --> 08:09.934
The curse's magic,
split between both halves

08:09.969 --> 08:11.335
of your shared heart...

08:11.370 --> 08:14.605
It's what keeps you from
being awake at the same time.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.440
If this potion clears up the darkness,

08:16.476 --> 08:18.409
you and Charming will be
able to make us all retch

08:18.444 --> 08:20.778
with your sweet nothings in no time.

08:30.423 --> 08:32.089
Regina, it's working.

08:40.099 --> 08:42.967
Ohh!

08:43.001 --> 08:45.903
What the hell?

08:45.938 --> 08:47.705
What happened?

08:47.740 --> 08:49.773
The Evil Queen happened.

08:49.809 --> 08:52.042
She must have baked a
failsafe in her curse.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.410
Our potion didn't weaken its magic.

08:53.446 --> 08:55.813
- It... It weakened your heart.
- What does that mean?

08:55.848 --> 08:57.548
It means by the end of the day,

08:57.583 --> 08:59.416
you'll both be asleep...

08:59.452 --> 09:01.619
with no way of waking up.

09:01.654 --> 09:05.289
So, Emma will fight the Final Battle...

09:05.324 --> 09:06.657
without us.

09:11.676 --> 09:12.746
Grumpy.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.402
We need your help.

09:14.438 --> 09:15.370
Who you calling grumpy?

09:15.405 --> 09:16.338
No, we don't have time for this.

09:16.373 --> 09:17.439
Round up the other Dwarfs.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.607
Now you're making this about my height?

09:18.642 --> 09:20.442
I'm sorry, Leroy.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.776
I accidentally let this patient

09:21.812 --> 09:23.678
out of the psych ward.

09:23.714 --> 09:24.613
What's wrong with him?

09:24.648 --> 09:26.014
It's called a curse for a reason.

09:26.049 --> 09:27.382
I think we're the only ones awake.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.351
It happened the moment
I put this by your bed.

09:29.386 --> 09:30.986
I think there's some
kind of magic in it.

09:31.021 --> 09:33.788
Look. Hey.

09:33.824 --> 09:35.991
Put these on. You need to blend in.

09:36.026 --> 09:37.158
You mean you've been living here

09:37.194 --> 09:38.493
since the Dark Curse struck?

09:38.529 --> 09:40.962
Well, Mary Margaret has,

09:40.998 --> 09:44.232
but I remember every
terrible minute of it.

09:44.268 --> 09:45.967
Wait.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.003
Where is she? Where's Emma?

09:48.038 --> 09:49.004
I don't know.

09:49.039 --> 09:49.971
Well, I put her in the wardrobe.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.306
If we're here, she must be here, too.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.541
Okay. Uh, Rumplestiltskin...

09:52.576 --> 09:53.875
if anyone knows how
to find her, it's him.

09:53.911 --> 09:56.444
How long ago did he disappear?

09:56.480 --> 09:58.647
Do you even know what a coma is?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.181
Get to Rumple.

10:00.217 --> 10:01.349
He's our best chance.

10:01.385 --> 10:03.385
If anyone else is awake,
it's going to be him.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.020
He has a... a store on Main Street

10:05.055 --> 10:06.788
called Mr. Gold's Pawn Shop.

10:06.823 --> 10:07.856
What are you gonna do?

10:07.891 --> 10:08.890
Keep Regina from figuring out

10:08.926 --> 10:10.191
what's really going on.

10:10.227 --> 10:12.327
There's an abandoned
farmhouse at the edge of town.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.129
Meet me there in an hour.

10:14.164 --> 10:18.133
A coma patient doesn't
get up and walk out of here

10:18.168 --> 10:20.068
without someone seeing something.

10:20.103 --> 10:21.436
Check the tapes again.

10:21.471 --> 10:23.838
You don't need to check them again.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.206
Excuse me, Miss Blanchard?

10:25.242 --> 10:26.374
You don't have to check
the tapes again, Reg...

10:26.410 --> 10:27.609
uh, Mayor Mills.

10:27.644 --> 10:28.810
I saw what happened.

10:28.845 --> 10:30.745
John Doe was sleepwalking.

10:30.781 --> 10:33.381
Is that so?

10:33.417 --> 10:35.784
Where exactly was he headed?

10:35.819 --> 10:37.786
Into the woods, away from town.

10:37.821 --> 10:40.255
The antidote didn't work, David.

10:40.290 --> 10:42.257
It just made things worse.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.925
So, we're going to have to figure out

10:43.961 --> 10:45.193
a way to do this thing

10:45.228 --> 10:47.295
the way we do everything... together.

10:47.331 --> 10:48.763
You did what?

10:48.799 --> 10:50.532
We're sorry, Emma. We were just
trying to make things better.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.100
You made it a hell of a lot worse.

10:52.135 --> 10:54.336
You keep blaming yourselves.

10:54.371 --> 10:55.937
It's not your fault.

10:55.973 --> 10:57.339
There's nothing you could have changed.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.506
We know, but that doesn't mean

10:58.542 --> 11:03.511
we're gonna let you
f-face it on your own.

11:03.547 --> 11:05.413
And you won't.

11:05.449 --> 11:06.548
I think your mother just found a way

11:06.583 --> 11:07.515
to break the sleeping curse.

11:07.551 --> 11:10.619
She just didn't realize it.

11:10.654 --> 11:11.820
Flower petals?

11:11.855 --> 11:13.421
Those aren't just any petals, Regina.

11:13.457 --> 11:15.023
Pretty boy is right.

11:15.058 --> 11:16.224
Those are Pixie petals.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.193
Exactly. And Pixie Dust might

11:18.228 --> 11:19.694
just be strong enough to wake us up.

11:19.730 --> 11:20.996
Well, I know about magic,

11:21.031 --> 11:23.465
and Pixie flowers only
grow for one reason...

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
in reaction to the
presence of great evil.

11:25.736 --> 11:27.802
So, if these flowers
just started sprouting up

11:27.838 --> 11:29.104
all over Storybrooke...

11:29.139 --> 11:31.906
I think the Author had the
right idea skipping town.

11:31.942 --> 11:35.443
Whoever you're meant to
face in this Final Battle...

11:35.479 --> 11:37.112
They're already here.

11:42.719 --> 11:45.020
Hello, Rumple.

11:47.924 --> 11:49.924
I believe the greeting
you're looking for

11:49.960 --> 11:51.626
is, "Hello, Mother."

11:54.998 --> 11:56.665
How did you get here?

11:56.700 --> 11:59.801
I had a little help.

11:59.836 --> 12:02.203
Father.

12:02.239 --> 12:04.339
Gideon.

12:04.374 --> 12:07.542
So, taking the Savior's power,

12:07.577 --> 12:09.411
becoming a hero...

12:09.446 --> 12:12.247
all a ruse in order to bring her here.

12:12.282 --> 12:13.615
I'm sorry, Father.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.083
She's my mother.

12:15.118 --> 12:17.085
Maybe one day you'll understand.

12:18.615 --> 12:20.955
Wh-What's going on?

12:22.726 --> 12:24.025
Belle.

12:24.061 --> 12:29.564
So lovely to make your acquaintance.

12:29.599 --> 12:32.634
Gideon, no matter what
you have done to help her,

12:32.669 --> 12:34.436
you can always come back to us.

12:34.471 --> 12:36.337
Oh, he's not going anywhere.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.075
We'll soon see about that.

12:43.947 --> 12:45.447
Put it down.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.518
There's a good boy.

12:50.554 --> 12:52.053
Don't look so surprised.

12:52.089 --> 12:55.256
I practically invented Dark Magic.

12:55.292 --> 12:57.258
But worry not.

12:57.294 --> 13:00.195
I won't force you to do anything.

13:00.230 --> 13:02.263
When you join me,

13:02.299 --> 13:05.700
it will be because you want to.

13:05.736 --> 13:07.936
Is that why you're here?

13:07.971 --> 13:10.405
Because I will never join you.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.707
Oh, when the darkness comes,

13:12.743 --> 13:15.677
you'll change your mind.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.781
And then, Rumplestiltskin,

13:19.816 --> 13:21.416
we can finally be the family

13:21.451 --> 13:24.052
we were always meant to be.

13:39.264 --> 13:41.909
_

13:48.494 --> 13:50.294
Can I help you with something?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.669
I almost didn't recognize
you without the scales.

13:58.704 --> 13:59.636
Excuse me?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.071
Oh, cut the act. There is no way

14:01.106 --> 14:02.506
you would let yourself
fall under the power

14:02.541 --> 14:05.342
of Regina's curse
when she's still awake.

14:05.377 --> 14:08.145
You don't seem very well.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.713
If you're looking for Dr. Hopper,

14:09.748 --> 14:10.847
his office is just down the street.

14:10.883 --> 14:11.982
All right. Enough games.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.250
I put my daughter through a wardrobe

14:13.285 --> 14:15.052
because you told me it
would break the curse.

14:15.087 --> 14:16.620
Now, where is she?

14:16.655 --> 14:18.889
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

14:18.924 --> 14:22.025
and I don't appreciate your tone.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.327
Intimidation won't make me

14:23.362 --> 14:25.295
remember something I don't know.

14:29.635 --> 14:33.870
I guess Snow was wrong.

14:33.906 --> 14:36.206
Looks like we're gonna have
to find Emma on our own.

14:38.444 --> 14:39.509
Emma?

14:42.281 --> 14:43.880
What a lovely name.

14:48.020 --> 14:51.021
Perhaps I can help you.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.390
You are awake.

14:53.425 --> 14:55.959
Just needed a proper wake-up call,

14:55.995 --> 14:58.562
one that I knew one day would come.

14:58.597 --> 15:00.130
Right. So where is she?

15:00.165 --> 15:01.398
Where's my daughter?

15:01.433 --> 15:03.333
I know that Emma is
destined to break the curse,

15:03.369 --> 15:04.601
but I don't know where she is

15:04.637 --> 15:06.536
and how she's meant to get back to us.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.904
Think harder.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.808
Tell me, dearie...

15:11.844 --> 15:14.478
What was it that woke you
from your miserable little life

15:14.513 --> 15:16.079
in the first place?

15:16.115 --> 15:17.447
It was a flower Snow found.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.249
Its magic woke us.

15:19.284 --> 15:21.551
The Pixie.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.553
Dust from that flower has the ability

15:23.589 --> 15:26.490
to reunite anyone who shares true love.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.592
Like Snow and me.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.260
And your daughter.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.099
Emma?

15:36.135 --> 15:37.300
Everything okay?

15:37.336 --> 15:38.635
Yeah, fine.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.270
You guys draw up the search grid?

15:40.305 --> 15:43.640
Yeah, we did, but if we're
gonna find that flower

15:43.676 --> 15:45.676
before we're both asleep for good,

15:45.711 --> 15:47.310
we're gonna need your
mother's tracking skills,

15:47.346 --> 15:49.579
which means it's time
for me to say good night.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.615
How do you do it, Dad?

15:51.650 --> 15:54.451
You and Mom have been separated
by the curse for weeks,

15:54.486 --> 15:57.621
and you still found a
way to work together.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.757
Well, even though I can't be with her,

16:00.793 --> 16:02.259
I know that she's fighting for me

16:02.294 --> 16:06.096
just as hard as I am for her.

16:06.131 --> 16:09.032
Emma, I know Hook is out
there doing the same for you.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.304
Thanks, Dad.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.478
Aah!

16:21.513 --> 16:24.614
Bloody hell.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.518
Look, is this about what
happened at Skull Rock?

16:28.554 --> 16:29.853
If this were about Skull Rock,

16:29.888 --> 16:32.856
I would have left you to be
gutted by those Lost Boys.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.057
Look, untie me.

16:34.093 --> 16:36.927
There's someone out there
whose life depends on it.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.595
Afraid I can't let you go,

16:38.630 --> 16:41.331
not until you agree
to do something for me.

16:41.366 --> 16:44.267
Well, perhaps you'd have
more luck if you just asked.

16:44.303 --> 16:46.303
And risk getting no for an answer?

16:49.208 --> 16:52.509
I need you to deliver
this to another realm.

16:52.544 --> 16:55.345
You're still captain of the
fastest ship on the seas,

16:55.380 --> 16:56.513
aren't you?

16:56.548 --> 16:59.449
I'm not your errand boy.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.717
The women I love is in danger,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.586
and every second I
spend arguing with you

17:02.621 --> 17:04.855
should be spent finding
a way back to her.

17:04.890 --> 17:05.922
You expect for me to believe

17:05.958 --> 17:09.593
that Killian Jones fell in love?

17:09.627 --> 17:10.827
This isn't driftwood.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.862
It's a weapon.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.296
And it's the only chance we have

17:13.332 --> 17:15.732
of winning the coming war.

17:15.768 --> 17:22.138
Whatever war there is,
it isn't mine to fight.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.307
There's a great darkness
on the horizon, Hook.

17:26.411 --> 17:29.179
If you don't do what I'm
asking, the Savior will die.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.482
The Savior?

17:32.518 --> 17:34.918
Yes. A great hero, unlike you.

17:34.953 --> 17:37.354
Bloody hell, Tiger, we're
talking about the same woman.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.758
You fell in love with the Savior?

17:41.794 --> 17:44.127
Aye. Check my inside pocket.

17:50.235 --> 17:53.069
That ring... It's for her.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.645
You need to get this to her.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.480
The Black Fairy is in Storybrooke.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.949
This is the only hope the
Savior has of defeating her.

18:05.984 --> 18:07.751
I wish it were that simple.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.153
There seems to be a curse keeping me

18:10.189 --> 18:11.788
from finding my way back home,

18:11.824 --> 18:15.792
unless you have some
magic that can lift it.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.928
I don't.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.362
But Pan might.

18:19.398 --> 18:22.933
Where might that demon
have kept this magic?

18:22.968 --> 18:25.135
In his old camp.

18:25.170 --> 18:26.937
But, Hook, it's overrun by Lost Boys.

18:26.972 --> 18:28.661
They outnumber us 20 to 1.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.941
Aye? Is that all?

18:30.976 --> 18:33.243
Then I feel sorry for those lads

18:33.278 --> 18:34.949
because they don't stand a chance.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.654
No sign of him by the water.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.592
They haven't found him

18:40.627 --> 18:42.527
in the South Woods, either.

18:42.563 --> 18:45.030
We should move the
search party into town.

18:45.065 --> 18:47.165
We can't go back into town.

18:49.203 --> 18:50.268
And why not?

18:50.304 --> 18:51.603
Because John Doe may still be

18:51.638 --> 18:53.905
in the woods somewhere. We
haven't looked everywhere.

18:57.945 --> 19:00.378
Miss Blanchard's right.

19:00.414 --> 19:02.714
We haven't checked the mines.

19:02.749 --> 19:05.317
Dr. Hopper, why don't you
and Pongo go have a look?

19:06.820 --> 19:09.354
Okay. All right.

19:09.389 --> 19:11.523
Come on, Pongo. Let's
go look in the mines.

19:21.235 --> 19:23.235
What are you doing?
This tunnel was rigged

19:23.270 --> 19:26.104
for demolition years ago.

19:26.140 --> 19:28.673
One push of this button,

19:28.709 --> 19:29.875
and it all comes down.

19:29.910 --> 19:31.510
I don't understand.
Why are you doing this?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.345
To test a theory of mine.

19:33.380 --> 19:35.113
You and John Doe...

19:35.149 --> 19:36.620
You're both awake.

19:39.119 --> 19:41.319
Uh, Madame Mayor,

19:41.355 --> 19:42.721
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:42.756 --> 19:44.656
I was just doing my normal rounds.

19:44.691 --> 19:48.093
Well, you see, that's exactly
what Snow White would say...

19:48.128 --> 19:52.030
just so she and her
prince can stay awake.

19:52.065 --> 19:54.866
But Snow White's also a hero.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.369
She would never let that Cricket die

19:57.404 --> 19:59.971
just to protect herself.

20:00.007 --> 20:02.807
Mary Margaret, on the other hand...

20:02.843 --> 20:05.110
She's never stood up to me.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.353
So...

20:15.389 --> 20:17.622
what's it going to be?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.991
Did you find something?

20:23.397 --> 20:24.596
What now?

20:24.631 --> 20:25.864
Oh, Madame Mayor, no, eh?

20:25.899 --> 20:28.166
Please don't touch that.

20:28.202 --> 20:30.569
It's very dangerous.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.538
Get out of my way.

20:33.574 --> 20:35.273
Where is she?

20:35.309 --> 20:37.142
Where's Snow White?

20:37.177 --> 20:38.643
The winds were blowing from the North.

20:38.679 --> 20:40.912
The petals had to have
come from around here.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.215
Look... down there.

20:51.191 --> 20:53.992
Wait. Zelena said
these flowers only grow

20:54.027 --> 20:55.760
in the presence of evil.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.763
So if there's a whole field of them...

20:58.799 --> 21:02.367
And here I was hoping
to make an entrance.

21:03.470 --> 21:04.803
Stay away from my daughter.

21:04.838 --> 21:09.908
Emma, I've been waiting a
very long time to meet you.

21:09.943 --> 21:12.244
So I guess you're the one
I fight in the Final Battle.

21:12.279 --> 21:13.878
I created the Dark Curse.

21:13.914 --> 21:15.580
You were born to break it.

21:15.616 --> 21:18.917
We've been destined to clash
since the beginning of time.

21:18.952 --> 21:20.819
I never should have sent an emissary

21:20.854 --> 21:22.053
to do what only I can.

21:22.089 --> 21:23.521
What the hell does that mean?

21:23.557 --> 21:25.023
How did you get here?

21:29.029 --> 21:32.364
Right. Never mind.

21:32.399 --> 21:34.032
So, is this it?

21:34.067 --> 21:35.467
Oh, no.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.036
You'll know when the
Final Battle begins.

21:38.071 --> 21:39.271
Everyone will.

21:39.306 --> 21:41.539
We won't let you hurt our daughter.

21:41.575 --> 21:43.408
Is that so?

21:43.443 --> 21:44.909
Because it's going to be hard to stop me

21:44.945 --> 21:47.245
when both Mummy and
Daddy are fast asleep.

21:50.417 --> 21:51.883
Gideon.

21:58.759 --> 22:00.925
Ah, it's better this way.

22:00.961 --> 22:04.296
No mother should have
to watch their child die.

22:13.640 --> 22:16.207
Why is it never past
their bloody bedtime?

22:16.243 --> 22:17.175
I'm afraid this is the only way

22:17.210 --> 22:19.544
you'll get this to the Savior.

22:19.579 --> 22:21.579
What kind of weapon is this?

22:21.615 --> 22:23.214
A wand.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.750
Well, part of one.

22:25.786 --> 22:28.453
The most powerful ever made.

22:28.488 --> 22:29.654
It's what banished the Black Fairy

22:29.690 --> 22:31.289
to the realm she was trapped in.

22:31.325 --> 22:33.658
Well, how did you get your hands on it?

22:33.694 --> 22:35.627
You're not the only one with
a past you'd rather forget.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.097
I used to be a Fairy.

22:42.436 --> 22:44.169
What made you give up your wings?

22:46.540 --> 22:49.974
I once was close to the Black Fairy.

22:50.010 --> 22:51.109
If anyone should have stopped her

22:51.144 --> 22:52.177
from walking down her dark path,

22:52.212 --> 22:54.245
it was me.

22:54.281 --> 22:56.181
But I failed.

22:57.951 --> 22:59.351
So after the Fairies banished her,

22:59.386 --> 23:01.853
I gave up my wings
and sought refuge here.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.423
Well, if a pirate like me
can get a second chance,

23:05.459 --> 23:06.858
then so can you.

23:06.893 --> 23:08.526
Neither one of us is
gonna get a second anything

23:08.562 --> 23:11.296
if you don't get that to Emma.

23:11.331 --> 23:14.065
You see that tree in the camp?

23:16.203 --> 23:17.669
Its sap contains the magic you'll need

23:17.704 --> 23:19.003
to find your way home.

23:19.039 --> 23:20.338
Aye.

23:20.374 --> 23:22.407
And how am I supposed
to make it to the tree,

23:22.442 --> 23:24.576
let alone Storybrooke?

23:24.611 --> 23:26.277
Leave that to me.

23:41.862 --> 23:44.295
Get her!

24:05.652 --> 24:08.253
Ahoy, mate.

24:12.959 --> 24:14.459
Get me home now!

24:25.305 --> 24:27.305
Get that wand to Emma!

24:30.243 --> 24:31.910
You know what to do!

24:48.604 --> 24:49.536
Oh!

24:49.572 --> 24:52.573
You're late. I was worried.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.508
We have to hurry. Regina's onto us.

24:54.543 --> 24:55.709
It won't be long before she finds out.

24:55.745 --> 24:56.844
Did you bring it?

24:59.181 --> 25:00.848
Rumple said its magic is strong enough

25:00.883 --> 25:02.249
to lead us to Emma.

25:02.284 --> 25:03.884
Let's go find our daughter.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.720
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.857
It appears we've only
been cursed for 10 years.

25:09.892 --> 25:13.026
She's still 18 years
shy of her 28th birthday,

25:13.062 --> 25:14.895
the day she's destined
to become the Savior.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.030
No, she doesn't have to be the
Savior anymore. We're awake.

25:17.066 --> 25:19.800
Well, Snow White and Prince
Charming may be awake,

25:19.835 --> 25:23.070
but the rest of this
town is very much asleep.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.838
Find Emma now,

25:24.874 --> 25:26.774
and she will never fulfill her destiny,

25:26.809 --> 25:28.542
the curse will never be broken,

25:28.577 --> 25:31.545
and everyone will be
trapped here forever.

25:31.580 --> 25:34.181
What do you expect us to
do... just leave her out there?

25:37.253 --> 25:38.719
Drink this,

25:38.754 --> 25:40.087
like I'm going to.

25:40.122 --> 25:41.722
It'll put you back under,

25:41.757 --> 25:43.590
and then, when the time is right,

25:43.626 --> 25:44.858
Emma will find us.

25:44.894 --> 25:45.993
That's easy for you to say.

25:46.028 --> 25:49.463
You don't have a child
who's out there by herself.

25:49.498 --> 25:53.066
You have no idea
what's out there for me.

25:53.102 --> 25:54.935
You can't stop us.

25:54.970 --> 25:57.371
You don't have magic in this world.

25:57.406 --> 25:59.940
Here, you're just a man.

25:59.975 --> 26:04.344
I don't need magic to stop you.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.014
You see, this potion...

26:07.049 --> 26:10.784
is the only way forward.

26:10.820 --> 26:13.987
I swore I would never
leave you alone again,

26:14.023 --> 26:15.589
and now the Final Battle is coming.

26:15.624 --> 26:17.191
It is my destiny.

26:17.226 --> 26:20.127
There's nothing you can do to change it.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.863
I already told Dad...
It's not your fault.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.366
Emma, that's not true.

26:26.402 --> 26:28.001
It is our fault.

26:28.037 --> 26:29.670
There's something you don't know.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.940
Wait. Look.

26:45.888 --> 26:48.255
How did that survive?

26:48.290 --> 26:50.390
Because it needed to.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.933
How exactly does this work?

26:59.969 --> 27:01.335
I don't know.

27:01.370 --> 27:05.706
Just think about Emma and
let the magic do the rest?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.253
Oh, she's beautiful.

27:59.128 --> 28:01.561
We can't waste another second.

28:01.597 --> 28:02.663
We can't miss another second.

28:02.698 --> 28:04.364
Wait.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.991
What? What's wrong?

28:07.836 --> 28:09.369
We can't go through there.

28:09.405 --> 28:11.171
Snow, we have to. If
we go through that door,

28:11.206 --> 28:13.941
Emma will never become the Savior.

28:13.976 --> 28:16.810
She'll have a new destiny with us.

28:16.845 --> 28:17.811
Don't listen to Rumple.

28:17.846 --> 28:19.980
No. I'm not.

28:20.015 --> 28:22.115
It's not just Rumple.

28:22.151 --> 28:25.319
Regina tested me earlier today.

28:25.354 --> 28:28.455
She said Snow White is a hero

28:28.490 --> 28:29.756
who wouldn't let anyone suffer

28:29.792 --> 28:31.558
just to get what she wants.

28:32.494 --> 28:34.294
She's right.

28:34.330 --> 28:35.862
I was prepared to lose everything

28:35.898 --> 28:37.030
to save Archie in that mine shaft.

28:37.066 --> 28:38.865
How is this any different?

28:38.901 --> 28:41.835
Because our daughter is right there.

28:41.870 --> 28:44.071
We... We can't ask her
to sacrifice her happiness

28:44.106 --> 28:45.272
to ensure everyone else's.

28:45.307 --> 28:48.108
But we have to.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.576
I have lived in this town

28:49.611 --> 28:51.845
with everyone we have ever known.

28:51.880 --> 28:55.248
And they're all separated
from the people they love, too.

28:55.284 --> 28:57.250
We can't sentence them
to this life forever

28:57.286 --> 28:58.618
just because we are unwilling

28:58.654 --> 29:00.620
to wait just a little bit longer.

29:03.425 --> 29:04.891
But what about Emma?

29:09.031 --> 29:11.031
We have to believe
that she's strong enough

29:11.066 --> 29:14.201
to grow up without us.

29:14.236 --> 29:15.535
Snow, I...

29:15.571 --> 29:17.170
You know that I'm right.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.278
How I wish you weren't.

29:34.490 --> 29:36.757
Emma, we will see you again.

29:54.510 --> 29:57.210
Oh, the search party.

29:57.246 --> 29:59.312
We don't have much time.

29:59.348 --> 30:00.981
Okay.

30:06.922 --> 30:07.988
I didn't think

30:08.023 --> 30:09.990
we'd be saying goodbye again so soon.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.525
Hey, hey, I know.

30:12.961 --> 30:14.094
Remember...

30:16.598 --> 30:18.265
I will always find you.

30:20.069 --> 30:21.568
And one day,

30:21.603 --> 30:24.504
Emma will find us.

30:48.230 --> 30:49.696
Oh.

31:03.245 --> 31:04.544
Mary Margaret!

31:04.580 --> 31:07.481
You found him.

31:07.516 --> 31:09.149
Is he all right?

31:13.455 --> 31:15.822
We don't have much time.

31:15.858 --> 31:17.557
Regina, please tell me there's enough.

31:17.593 --> 31:20.327
Barely, but it'll do.

31:20.362 --> 31:22.829
It'll break this sleeping
curse once and for all.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.033
What now?

31:27.069 --> 31:28.068
The Black Fairy.

31:28.103 --> 31:29.870
She wants to stop us.

31:29.905 --> 31:31.838
That's not the Black Fairy.

31:31.874 --> 31:33.807
I-It's a shadow.

31:33.842 --> 31:35.475
It's Hook's shadow.

31:44.419 --> 31:45.952
What is this?

31:45.988 --> 31:47.454
Where's Hook?

31:53.629 --> 31:55.328
There's something wrong.

31:55.364 --> 31:57.030
He's in trouble.

31:57.065 --> 31:58.965
What's going on?

31:59.001 --> 32:00.634
Where is he?

32:13.682 --> 32:14.781
No.

32:14.816 --> 32:15.973
No.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.153
Mom, it's gonna be okay.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.341
We'll find him.

32:22.991 --> 32:25.325
We don't even know where he is.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.909
Yes, you do.

32:28.130 --> 32:30.730
This magic can reunite
anyone who shares true love.

32:30.766 --> 32:32.299
It can open a door to Hook.

32:32.334 --> 32:33.500
How do you know that?

32:33.535 --> 32:35.368
Because we once used
Pixie Dust to find you

32:35.404 --> 32:38.004
when you were a little girl.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.406
What?

32:39.441 --> 32:40.640
If we had gone through with it, Emma,

32:40.676 --> 32:43.243
you would have grown up with us.

32:43.278 --> 32:44.911
We would have been a family.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.112
You wouldn't have become the Savior.

32:46.148 --> 32:49.115
You wouldn't be fighting
the Final Battle now.

32:49.151 --> 32:50.483
I get it.

32:50.519 --> 32:51.952
You had to do what was
right for everyone else

32:51.987 --> 32:53.153
before yourselves.

32:53.188 --> 32:56.189
And today, I'm putting you first.

32:56.225 --> 32:59.993
You have a future, someone you love.

33:00.028 --> 33:01.061
I can't.

33:01.096 --> 33:03.630
This is your one chance
of breaking the curse.

33:03.665 --> 33:06.132
Hook needs it more than we do.

33:06.168 --> 33:09.069
Eventually you'll find a way to wake us.

33:11.139 --> 33:13.807
We took so much from you.

33:13.842 --> 33:17.244
We can't take him, too...

33:17.279 --> 33:19.980
not before the Final Battle.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.155
For your crimes against Pan,

33:29.549 --> 33:32.217
the Lost Boys sentence you to death.

33:32.245 --> 33:33.945
Sorry, Captain.

33:33.980 --> 33:35.446
Don't be.

33:35.482 --> 33:37.582
All that matters is
that Emma got the wand.

33:42.622 --> 33:43.721
Killian!

33:43.757 --> 33:45.590
Emma? What are you doing?

33:45.625 --> 33:46.658
Run now!

33:51.197 --> 33:53.231
We've got to go!

33:57.037 --> 33:58.136
Where is she?

33:58.171 --> 33:59.704
Where's Tiger Lily?

33:59.739 --> 34:01.172
She got away!

34:03.610 --> 34:06.044
You all right?

34:09.181 --> 34:11.783
- How did you...
- We got your message.

34:12.864 --> 34:14.202
Right here.

34:18.024 --> 34:20.158
I'm sorry, Emma.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.293
I should have told you what
I did to your grandfather

34:22.328 --> 34:23.628
all those years ago,

34:23.663 --> 34:25.396
and I should never,

34:25.431 --> 34:27.197
never have even considered running away.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.900
It's okay. I didn't exactly make it easy

34:28.935 --> 34:30.935
for you to tell me the truth.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.303
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

34:32.338 --> 34:33.705
No.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.139
No. There's something I have to do

34:36.176 --> 34:38.710
before I get pushed into another portal.

34:41.181 --> 34:44.181
And this time...

34:44.217 --> 34:45.983
I'm gonna do it the right way.

34:51.091 --> 34:53.056
Swan...

34:53.092 --> 34:56.893
and I know... that you
face an uncertain future,

34:56.929 --> 35:02.033
but there's one thing that
I want you to be certain of...

35:02.068 --> 35:05.937
that I will always,
always be by your side.

35:07.006 --> 35:08.306
So...

35:10.543 --> 35:12.143
Emma Swan...

35:15.081 --> 35:17.415
what do you say?

35:17.450 --> 35:19.317
Will you marry me?

35:24.958 --> 35:25.957
Yes.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.012
Where are your parents?

35:48.047 --> 35:50.681
I feel like it's time I
finally faced your father.

35:54.087 --> 35:56.254
Bloody hell.

35:56.289 --> 35:57.588
What happened?

36:00.093 --> 36:01.959
They went into a sleeping curse

36:01.995 --> 36:03.728
so I could save you.

36:09.002 --> 36:12.170
Emma... I was thinking.

36:12.205 --> 36:14.839
There might be another way to break it,

36:14.874 --> 36:16.474
but it's risky.

36:18.178 --> 36:19.243
Thank you for coming.

36:19.279 --> 36:22.213
I know living in Storybrooke isn't easy.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.178
I certainly didn't
always make it that way.

36:26.619 --> 36:28.486
But I learned something today...

36:28.521 --> 36:32.890
that, once, Snow and Charming
had a chance to leave this town

36:33.333 --> 36:35.660
to find their own happiness.

36:35.695 --> 36:39.030
But they chose to stay

36:39.065 --> 36:42.366
for the good of everyone here.

36:42.402 --> 36:46.637
Now I'm going to ask you
to do something for them.

36:51.077 --> 36:54.011
This is a sleeping curse

36:54.047 --> 36:57.014
the Evil Queen placed
on their shared heart.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.417
It was meant for one heart.

36:59.452 --> 37:02.820
But if we share the curse,

37:02.856 --> 37:05.223
we might dilute its power.

37:05.258 --> 37:06.557
Might?

37:08.281 --> 37:11.495
I'd be ash right now
if it weren't for them.

37:11.531 --> 37:12.763
Cheers, love.

37:24.244 --> 37:26.210
Here goes.

37:37.624 --> 37:39.657
What the hell?

37:39.692 --> 37:41.325
I could use a nap.

37:50.470 --> 37:52.103
I'm in.

37:55.842 --> 37:57.270
Yes.

37:58.578 --> 38:00.011
Cent'anni.

38:23.703 --> 38:25.569
David.

38:25.605 --> 38:27.071
Snow.

38:31.611 --> 38:34.445
You did it.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.113
I didn't do anything.

38:43.523 --> 38:44.948
No.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.293
No. No!

38:49.329 --> 38:51.295
Emma. No.

38:54.534 --> 38:56.000
- Emma.
- Dad.

38:56.035 --> 38:57.234
You woke us up.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.370
How?

38:59.405 --> 39:02.306
It was easy. We just all
shared a tiny bit of your curse.

39:15.588 --> 39:18.089
I take it Emma hasn't
told you my secret.

39:18.124 --> 39:19.541
Oh, she did.

39:20.927 --> 39:22.893
And it was a long time ago.

39:24.931 --> 39:26.831
You're a changed man now, Hook.

39:26.866 --> 39:28.499
We've all seen it.

39:38.745 --> 39:39.844
You did it.

39:39.879 --> 39:40.911
Well, it wouldn't have worked

39:40.947 --> 39:43.080
if you hadn't inspired all these people.

39:46.386 --> 39:48.652
You gave up your family for them.

39:48.688 --> 39:51.722
And got a bigger one in return.

39:51.758 --> 39:55.893
That's how I know that we'll
defeat the Black Fairy, Emma.

39:55.928 --> 39:58.662
No matter what she does,
you will not face her alone.

40:08.508 --> 40:10.741
There's never enough time, is there?

40:10.777 --> 40:12.910
Whether it's fast or slow

40:12.945 --> 40:15.279
or even if it doesn't move at all,

40:15.314 --> 40:18.482
but especially when the end is near.

40:18.518 --> 40:20.551
You gave my dagger back... Why?

40:20.586 --> 40:22.420
As I told you,

40:22.455 --> 40:25.956
you're going to choose
to be part of this family.

40:25.992 --> 40:27.024
Does it have to do with the fact

40:27.060 --> 40:30.561
that Gideon didn't choose you?

40:30.596 --> 40:32.296
You think I don't know?

40:32.331 --> 40:35.232
You have his heart.

40:37.637 --> 40:40.204
You were always such a clever boy.

40:40.239 --> 40:42.339
How did you figure it out?

40:42.375 --> 40:44.308
You ordered him to
destroy the Pixie flowers.

40:44.343 --> 40:47.278
It seems he kept one alive.

40:47.313 --> 40:49.046
A true believer wouldn't
do that, now, would he?

40:49.082 --> 40:51.816
That's not possible.

40:51.851 --> 40:53.818
He wouldn't disobey me like that.

40:53.853 --> 40:55.886
And yet he did.

40:55.922 --> 40:58.656
He found a way to resist your command

40:58.691 --> 41:02.093
because he has his mother in him,

41:02.128 --> 41:04.395
the one who truly loves him.

41:04.430 --> 41:06.630
But he won't have to resist anymore.

41:06.666 --> 41:09.834
I will get his heart back.

41:09.869 --> 41:11.202
Hmm.

41:13.806 --> 41:16.283
If you come at me,

41:17.421 --> 41:21.345
there may be nothing left
of this town when we finish.

41:21.380 --> 41:22.413
Hmm.

41:23.416 --> 41:26.417
Well, I suppose that's a
price I'm willing to pay.
