WEBVTT

00:11.670 --> 00:13.376
I don't think you got it.

00:15.740 --> 00:18.675
You're gonna have
to pay to find out.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.969
I should've
taken you for a shark
when I sat down with you.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.984
Eight hours ago
at the casino.

00:24.050 --> 00:26.052
Thanks for the watch
by the way. Fancy.

00:27.920 --> 00:31.424
Maybe you're just
pretending to lose
because you like to get naked.

00:34.100 --> 00:35.499
You want to make
this Interesting?

00:35.560 --> 00:37.164
Isn't it interesting already?

00:38.430 --> 00:40.534
I'll call and I'll
raise you this ring

00:40.600 --> 00:42.807
that Keith Richards
gave me personally.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.428
I don't want the ring.

00:44.510 --> 00:45.738
You're not getting
my shorts.

00:45.810 --> 00:47.129
Based on the way
things are going,

00:47.210 --> 00:48.404
I'd say I got
a pretty good shot

00:48.480 --> 00:51.540
at getting you
completely naked.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.249
We both know
what I'm putting up.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.757
Call it.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.049
Hey.
AL: Hey.

01:08.130 --> 01:10.963
Thomas Warner, the architect.
You got 10 million
bucks laying around,

01:11.030 --> 01:13.089
he'll design
your home for you.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.161
And he was getting
some award last night.

01:15.240 --> 01:17.458
Told his wife he
forgot something
at the office.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.338
Might have to work all night.

01:20.410 --> 01:22.105
(IN DISTINCT RADIO
CONVERSATIONS)

01:22.180 --> 01:24.808
Cause of death looks
to be blunt-force
trauma to the head.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.944
No sign of a struggle, huh?

01:33.320 --> 01:35.515
No defensive wounds.

01:35.590 --> 01:38.058
They're bagging
his hands to test
his fingernails for DNA,

01:38.130 --> 01:42.191
but so far, looks like
he was taken by surprise.

01:44.770 --> 01:47.034
Or killed by
someone who knew him.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.817
So, what do we know
about Warner?

02:07.890 --> 02:09.528
Well, the guy
didn't become the most

02:09.590 --> 02:11.148
successful architect since
Frank Gehry

02:11.230 --> 02:12.697
without pissing
off a few people.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.159
And came from
humble beginnings.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.198
Started his business in '86.

02:16.270 --> 02:20.092
Got his big break
with the Renstein house
over in Oyster Bay.

02:20.170 --> 02:22.866
I took a tour of that house.
It's amazmg.

02:22.940 --> 02:26.535
It has_ walls
that open Into rooms
and secret passages.

02:26.610 --> 02:29.773
Then there's the womanizing.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.243
What about women?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.947
Look who's decided
to join the party.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.215
No, I'm saying
they can be
potential suspects.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.645
Well, there's
nobody so far,

02:38.720 --> 02:40.608
but things got so bad between
Warner and his wife,

02:40.690 --> 02:42.089
they had to
separate a few months back.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.779
We're talking lawyers,
private detectives.
Got real nasty.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.657
Then all of a sudden
they're back together.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.869
Supposedly he
swore off cheating.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.069
Old habits die hard.
I called his lawyer.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.394
I haven't heard back.
Warner has no kids.

02:54.470 --> 02:57.564
His favorite
charity is himself.
My guess, she gets it all.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.540
Was it unusual for your
husband to stay late
at the office?

03:08.320 --> 03:10.538
Why don't you ask me
your real question?

03:10.620 --> 03:12.759
Was my husband
still cheating on me?

03:12.820 --> 03:15.653
We're not here to judge
what went on in
your marriage. Okay?

03:15.720 --> 03:17.859
We just want to know
where you were last night.

03:17.930 --> 03:21.195
Our driver brought me home
after Tom went
back to the office.

03:21.260 --> 03:24.491
I had a glass of sherry,
took a sleeping pill
and went to sleep.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.731
Anyone else there
to confirm that?

03:26.800 --> 03:29.530
No, but I put
the alarm system on, didn't

03:29.610 --> 03:32.477
deactivate it till
the maid arrived at 7:00.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.576
Did you notice
anything unusual

03:34.640 --> 03:36.574
about your husband
in the past few days?

03:36.650 --> 03:37.969
Anything at all?

03:38.050 --> 03:40.041
Well, I can't speak
to the last few days

03:40.120 --> 03:43.112
since he was at
a conference In Boston.

03:43.190 --> 03:45.579
Looks like he was
taken by surprise.

04:03.940 --> 04:06.101
Thank you.
We're sorry for your loss.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.999
Please find who
did this to Tommy.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.177
We'll do our best.

04:18.990 --> 04:20.514
So, what is it?

04:22.890 --> 04:25.279
The travel case
in his office,
the luggage tag

04:25.360 --> 04:27.851
was brand new.
Return date, yesterday.

04:27.930 --> 04:29.363
Guessing it
wasn't from Boston.

04:29.430 --> 04:32.092
SJU, San Juan, Puerto Rico.

04:32.170 --> 04:35.196
Maybe his cheating days
weren't behind him after all.

04:35.270 --> 04:37.864
AL: To test his fingernails
with DNA, but so far...

04:45.850 --> 04:49.388
His assistant.
She had tan lines,
like a sunburn.

04:49.450 --> 04:51.611
What if she was in
Puerto Rico with him?

04:51.690 --> 04:54.659
I didn't kill Tom.
He was my boss.

04:54.720 --> 04:58.053
And who historically
couldn't keep it in his pants,
right? And you!

04:58.130 --> 04:59.154
You went to
Puerto Rico with him.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.754
We were there on business.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.491
Then why would
Warner lie to his wife
about where he was going

05:02.570 --> 05:03.696
and who he was going with?

05:03.770 --> 05:05.397
The reason the trip
was a secret is because

05:05.470 --> 05:07.028
of a project Tom
was bidding on.

05:07.100 --> 05:10.001
_ We all had to
Sign nondisclosure
agreements. You can check.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.606
You still could
have killed him.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.103
I mean you were
sleeping with him, right?

05:13.180 --> 05:18.470
No. Tom was a mentor.
And he and Holly
were doing okay,

05:22.950 --> 05:23.939
VVho?

05:24.020 --> 05:26.488
My ex-boyfriend.
Zack Follet.

05:26.560 --> 05:29.313
We only dated for
a couple of months.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.585
He was really possessive.
Jealous.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.049
Did Zack ever do
anything about his
suspicions of you and Warner?

05:34.130 --> 05:38.760
He followed me.
I got a restraining order,
but that didn't stop Zack.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.367
One time he put
a dead fish on Tom's car.

05:42.970 --> 05:45.768
Zack works at
the Brooklyn Navy
Yard Fish Market.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.603
He ever confront
Warner dIrectly?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.602
One time Tom and I
were In a busmess dInner

05:49.680 --> 05:52.615
and Zack came
by and he told Tom...

05:55.020 --> 05:56.544
He said he was
going to kill him.

05:58.450 --> 06:00.611
DENNY: Oh, this place stinks.

06:00.690 --> 06:02.749
I love the smell of fish.
What?

06:02.830 --> 06:04.980
I spent a summer in Alaska
working at a cannery.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.891
Oh, look at you,
a regular Bear
Grylls over here.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.498
VVho?
C'mon, Bear Grylls. TV guy.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.219
Rugged mountain man.
Goes up into the mountains

06:12.300 --> 06:13.562
with nothing but, like,
the clothes on his back

06:13.640 --> 06:14.834
and some twine and stuff.

06:14.900 --> 06:17.368
Hey, here's our guy.
Zack Follet?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.079
NYPD. Just wanna ask you
a couple questions.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.131
Oh, damn it!

06:32.220 --> 06:33.209
Come on!

06:38.830 --> 06:39.899
No, no, no, no!

06:39.960 --> 06:43.020
Don't move.
You son of a bitch!

06:43.100 --> 06:44.590
You got fish
guts on my new tie!

06:44.670 --> 06:46.399
Hey, don't worry about it.
It's an improvement, Boss.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.701
Cuff him.
You're under arrest
on suspICIon of murder.

06:51.740 --> 06:53.776
What?
Let's go.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.673
AL: Last night, Thomas Warner.
Where were you?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.706
Look, I got an alibi.
I was 80 miles

06:58.780 --> 07:01.317
off the coast of New York
on the Alba Varden.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.712
Check with my captain.

07:03.790 --> 07:06.042
I can't help it. I'm in love.
Have you ever been in love?

07:06.120 --> 07:08.452
That's a complicated story
I'm not telling you.

07:08.520 --> 07:11.057
Them late nights
at the office he had
with Julie. The trips...

07:11.130 --> 07:12.358
Were none of
your busmess.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.751
Unless they were.
He's a stalker.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.354
He must have followed Julie

07:16.430 --> 07:17.624
before she
and Warner left town.
What'd you see?

07:19.170 --> 07:21.593
Actually three nights ago,
I saw Warner

07:21.670 --> 07:24.161
coming out of the office
with another guy.

07:24.240 --> 07:27.368
They were pissed. Yelling.
And I had the windows up.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.977
I couldn't hear
what they were saying,
but they walked right by me.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.405
They start shoving.
Took a couple of swings.

07:32.480 --> 07:33.947
Can you tell us
anything else about
this other guy?

07:34.020 --> 07:35.669
Yeah. He's, he's that guy.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.889
_Great! That narrows
It down to every guy.

07:37.950 --> 07:41.078
Real estate guy.
The one with all the hotels.
Dating chicks half his age.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.580
Dewar Linden?

07:46.360 --> 07:49.761
JAY: Meet Dewar Linden,
Manhattan real
estate gazillionaire.

07:49.830 --> 07:53.231
Oh, my God.
How many zeros
are there in a gazillion?

07:53.300 --> 07:54.938
Enough that we
need to tread lightly.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.366
So, what do we have,
other than a slugfest

07:57.440 --> 07:59.032
between a couple
of rich white guys?

07:59.110 --> 08:03.376
Uh, our dead architect just
dropped out of Linden's
latest tower downtown.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.441
And it looks like
he bailed because
of a disagreement

08:05.510 --> 08:07.944
over an earlier project.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.715
The Sicilian in
Atlantic City.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.917
Bro, this place opened,
like, a month ago.
I've been dying to go there.

08:11.990 --> 08:15.915
You know,
in my vast experience,
most people who kill for money

08:15.990 --> 08:17.321
are the ones who
already have It.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.926
Let's pay Mr. Linden a visit.

08:18.990 --> 08:20.526
Hold on, boss.
According to TSA,

08:20.600 --> 08:22.420
he just left for
Belgium this morning.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.094
What? The day after
Warner's murder?
Isn't that interesting.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.491
Let me see what I can do
about getting Mr. Linden back.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.175
DENNY: Hey, Carrie.

08:35.240 --> 08:36.434
Hey, boys, what we got?

08:36.510 --> 08:38.501
We got latex, Carrie. Latex.

08:38.580 --> 08:40.172
CSU found traces of
it on the doorknob

08:40.250 --> 08:42.468
to Warner's _office.
All right? We just got
the latest report.

08:42.550 --> 08:44.086
Okay. So, the killer
wore gloves.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.412
Didn_'t wann_a
leave fingerprints.

08:45.490 --> 08:46.809
Guess what else
CSU found though.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.983
CARRIE: What?
Azelastine hydrochloride.

08:49.060 --> 08:51.153
Active ingredient
in nasal spray.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.221
A killer with a cold.
This is great, guys.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.222
No. See, we looked
into the azelastine
thing, right?

08:55.300 --> 08:56.767
It's also heavily used in...

08:56.830 --> 08:58.263
Safecracking.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.160
What?
I was gonna say

09:01.240 --> 09:02.298
the safecracking thing.
What's the difference?

09:02.370 --> 09:03.507
No, because, I mean, look...

09:03.570 --> 09:05.367
All right, guys.
The case! The case!

09:05.440 --> 09:07.203
DENNY: Sorry. Right. Yeah.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.168
So, the strange thing is,
_ there is no safe
In Warner's offIce.

09:09.240 --> 09:10.275
DENNY: Right.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.015
No defensive wounds.

09:17.850 --> 09:22.219
Yes, there is.
Warner was famous_
for maXImIZIng space. RIght?

09:22.290 --> 09:25.384
Now, I saw a groove
in one of the moldings
in his office.

09:25.460 --> 09:27.724
I'm gonna bet you
that's a fake wall

09:27.800 --> 09:29.825
and there's
a safe right behind it.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.294
I knew about the wall.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.496
Something else you
failed to mention.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.562
I've never been inside.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.029
Tom kept his
personal things in here.

09:41.110 --> 09:43.340
He gave me the combination,
but he told me

09:43.410 --> 09:45.298
only to use it in
case of an emergency.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.075
Well, I would say
this qualifies.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.596
So, what are we
looking for in here?

10:04.870 --> 10:06.792
I don't know.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.498
But whatever it is,
it's what got Warner killed.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.575
The girl's unbelievable.
She sees a crack

10:19.650 --> 10:22.141
in the wall and presto,
a hidden safe.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.518
Warner kept
a detailed inventory
of everything.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.784
So, whatever's missing,

10:25.850 --> 10:27.181
the killer probably stole.

10:27.260 --> 10:28.989
Okay. We'll have that
figured out in no time.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.381
Ah, it's gonna take
longer than that.
Warner was a hoarder.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.496
There are over
5,000 items in there.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.996
The evidence guy
is cross-referencing
the inventory list

10:37.070 --> 10:39.129
against what was
still in the safe.
Right.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.088
Speaking of Warner's safe.

10:41.170 --> 10:43.900
This thing is a monster.

10:43.970 --> 10:45.938
Best security money can buy.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.205
Now I talked to my NSA guy.
He says there

10:48.280 --> 10:50.202
are only six
safecracker guys out there

10:50.280 --> 10:53.044
who would even have
the stones to try to break
into this bad boy

10:53.120 --> 10:55.918
and only one of
them was in New York.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.289
This gem, Billy Ganz.

10:58.350 --> 10:59.783
Did a three-year
stretch up in Attica.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.350
Just got out
a few months ago.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.559
He used to be
head of security
for Shane McCloud.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.188
Vegas guy

11:05.260 --> 11:07.296
who went to Atlantic City.
Ran things there for a while

11:07.360 --> 11:08.588
till Dewar Linden showed up.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.628
There_ were files on
lawswts In the safe

11:10.700 --> 11:12.622
between Dewar Linden
and Shane McCloud.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.361
But Warner's not
part of any of 'em.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.237
What's a lawsuit
that has nothing to do
with Warner doing in his safe?

11:16.300 --> 11:17.961
Be sure to ask Linden
when you speak to him.

11:18.040 --> 11:19.507
He's on his way
back from Belgium.

11:19.570 --> 11:21.709
That's right.
I'm on escort duty.
I'll see you, guys.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.973
What's up?

11:24.050 --> 11:26.871
Dueling billionaires.
Shane McCloud
and Dewar Linden.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.918
McCloud's having to
shut down his
biggest casino,

11:28.980 --> 11:30.083
The Arabian Kingdom,

11:30.150 --> 11:32.880
just as Linden opens
his up right next door.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.109
Oh, that would piss me off.

11:34.190 --> 11:35.987
It can't be a coincidence.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.880
Shane McCloud's
former head of security,
Billy Ganz,

11:37.960 --> 11:39.928
is one of the only people
who could have
cracked Warner's safe.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.719
Plus, Ganz is off the grid.
He skipped parole.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.564
All right.
Well, let's look into
Ganz's known associates.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.606
You want to make
thIs InterestIng?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.079
Isn't it interesting already?

11:58.410 --> 12:00.742
Holy shit.
What?

12:00.820 --> 12:02.572
What?
You know something.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.217
Just, let me run
something down

12:05.290 --> 12:07.656
and if it turns out to
be real I'll clue you in.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.982
Okay

12:09.060 --> 12:10.379
Yeah, okay.
Okay.

12:31.180 --> 12:32.772
You look better than
you did three years ago.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.249
You don't look
so bad yourself.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.917
I'm surprised
to hear from you.

12:38.990 --> 12:42.312
If you're looking
for a rematch
on the strip poker.

12:42.390 --> 12:44.221
I'm ready.

12:44.290 --> 12:46.258
Are you ready
to lose again?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.890
Oh, thank you, by the way,
for letting me
keep this little guy.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.121
You couldn't have
paid me to take it.
Looks good on you though.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.497
Thank you.
Can I get you a drink?

12:52.570 --> 12:53.594
I'm not supposed
to drink on duty.

12:53.670 --> 12:55.592
On duty?

12:55.670 --> 12:57.001
You know,
if this is our second date,

12:57.070 --> 12:58.708
I think I should
know what you do.

12:58.770 --> 13:00.408
Let me guess. You're smart.
Mmm-hmm.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.072
And you are fashionable.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.903
Oh.

13:03.980 --> 13:07.313
You are a total
control freak that gets
everything she wants.

13:07.380 --> 13:10.417
I'm gonna say that
you are a doctor.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.139
Doctor?

13:12.220 --> 13:13.710
Very disappointed in you.

13:14.890 --> 13:15.879
I'm a cop.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.596
That's perfect.
I got a stack of parking
tickets you can fix for me.

13:21.660 --> 13:25.960
That's below my pay grade.
And why would I help a felon?

13:26.030 --> 13:28.260
Congrats on making
parole by the way.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.108
So...

13:34.180 --> 13:35.932
What was a cop
doing counting cards

13:36.010 --> 13:37.341
in a casino
the nIght I met you?

13:37.410 --> 13:39.446
The same thing I
was doing with you.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.613
Having fun.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.916
But I'm here on
busmess rIght now.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.515
There's a murder
tied to Atlantic City.

13:46.590 --> 13:50.253
An architect, Thomas Warner.
You know him?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.480
I think one of
your guys is involved.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.893
You could've handcuffed
me and brought me in
for questioning,

13:55.960 --> 14:00.192
but I think you called me
because you miss me.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.464
I didn't kill him.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.900
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.333
I'm gonna give
you fair warning.

14:08.410 --> 14:11.140
If you're involved in this...

14:11.210 --> 14:13.917
I'm gonna catch you
and I'm gonna take you down.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.964
Okay, what do you
we got on Ganz?
Hey.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.930
So, it looks like
he's been bumming it

14:33.000 --> 14:34.297
with his cousin
in Atlantic City

14:34.370 --> 14:35.632
which is very
interesting since

14:35.700 --> 14:37.668
the Fast Pass on
hIs couSIn's LIncoln

14:40.280 --> 14:43.272
an hour before the murder
and back again an hour after.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.806
All roads lead
to Atlantic City.

14:44.880 --> 14:47.178
Yeah, we're thinking
casino guy McCloud
sends his boy Ganz

14:47.250 --> 14:48.877
to get something
from Warner's safe.

14:48.950 --> 14:51.111
Ganz gets his cousin
Curtis to drive him in.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.852
You know,
Warner surprises him
and Ganz takes him out.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.956
Not bad, guys. Not bad.

14:59.560 --> 15:04.395
Carrie. Remember how
you complaIned that
I never take you anywhere?

15:04.470 --> 15:07.064
All right, well,
of course, you remember.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.581
I'm surprised this
place is closing down.

15:25.650 --> 15:27.515
Do you remember
the last time we were
in Atlantic City?

15:27.590 --> 15:29.956
February 9, 2001.
A full moon.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.954
Ah! I remember you
ditched me to play
blackjack all night.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.851
Yeah, and I came back
to the hotel room $8,000 up.

15:35.930 --> 15:37.329
Yes, I remember.

15:39.430 --> 15:40.636
All that cash.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.032
All that cash?
That's what you remember?

15:50.680 --> 15:53.774
So, about that thing.
I went to see a guy,

15:53.850 --> 15:55.818
um, who I thought
might know something

15:55.880 --> 15:57.381
about Warner's murder.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.088
And did he?
No.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.519
I'm guessing you have
a past with this guy.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.228
Well, define "past".

16:04.290 --> 16:05.757
Is it gonna get in
the way of the case?

16:05.830 --> 16:08.048
Have I ever let my
romantic relationships

16:08.130 --> 16:10.018
get in the way of our cases?
Don't answer that.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.259
Okay. We need to
get to Shane McCloud,

16:13.340 --> 16:15.661
and hopefully he
points us to Billy Ganz.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.529
Blackjack.
Of course.

16:26.150 --> 16:27.913
Hey.
DEALER: How you doin'?

16:27.980 --> 16:29.072
Whoo.

16:29.820 --> 16:30.844
Money, please.

16:34.190 --> 16:35.953
Split the eights.

16:36.020 --> 16:37.726
Splitting eights.

16:37.790 --> 16:40.293
Excuse me,
Mrs. Applebee.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.429
This is not Mrs...

16:41.500 --> 16:42.956
Yes. Mrs. Applebee. Yes.

16:43.030 --> 16:45.123
You know you're not allowed
to gamble in this casino.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.168
I was testing you.
Well done.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.834
All right, all right.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.935
Have a good day.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.071
Care to explain,
Mrs. Applebee?

16:56.140 --> 16:57.277
I have a plan.

16:57.350 --> 16:58.840
That's just one
of my pseudonyms.

16:58.910 --> 17:00.514
The burden of
being a good gambler.

17:00.580 --> 17:02.172
You mean card counter.
Ahh.

17:02.250 --> 17:04.218
And, yes, I see him.

17:04.290 --> 17:06.246
Excuse me.
Hmm.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.117
Hotel security.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.988
I'll see you and
I'll raise you.
NYPD, Major Crimes.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.652
We wanna talk to McCloud.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.254
Mr. McCloud's not here.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.319
Really?

17:18.600 --> 17:19.919
Follow me, please.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.228
Mmm-hmm.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.799
Ain't nothing going on in
The Arabian Kingdom

17:27.880 --> 17:29.973
I can't see from here,
including you two.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.268
Now, what interest
do two New York

17:31.350 --> 17:33.318
detectives have
in Atlantic City?

17:33.380 --> 17:36.349
We're investigating
a murder.

17:36.420 --> 17:39.014
Hey. Why don't you
make yourself useful, huh?

17:39.090 --> 17:42.355
Go get me some sushi.
A couple of salmon rolls.

17:45.260 --> 17:46.989
A certain
New York architect?

17:47.060 --> 17:48.391
You don't sound surprised.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.099
It wasn't me.
If Dewar Linden,

17:51.170 --> 17:53.263
who stole this town from me,
would've ended up dead...

17:53.340 --> 17:54.989
Puts up that
Sicilian mega casino

17:55.070 --> 17:57.459
next to mine and buys me
out for a couple bucks.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.407
Do you know what he's
putting up right where
you're standing right now?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.970
A water park.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.168
Frank Sinatra sang here
at The Arabian Kingdom.
Richard Pryor.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.312
Linden and I used
to be good friends.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.484
I haven't seen
him in 20 years.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.086
Here's to another 20.

18:13.390 --> 18:14.687
Yeah, it hasn't
been that long since

18:14.760 --> 18:16.489
you've seen your
security guard, Ganz.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.551
Ganz is a nut job.
I had to fire his ass.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.949
IfI have ex-cons
hanging around here

18:20.030 --> 18:21.918
I'd have the Gaming
Commission up my ass.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.490
Now if you're not
gonna arrest me...

18:24.530 --> 18:26.122
Maybe we'll see you again.

18:26.200 --> 18:30.660
Meantime, if you need
of a place to stay tonight,
we have rooms available.

18:30.740 --> 18:33.732
I've already arranged
our accommodations
at The Sicilian.

18:33.810 --> 18:35.971
The Sicilian?

18:36.040 --> 18:37.769
I think we're done here.

18:58.870 --> 19:00.235
AL: Did you really
have to bring so much?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.188
Well, we're in Atlantic City.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.464
You never know what
you're gonna need.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.907
Wow, you sprung for a suite!

19:06.970 --> 19:09.632
C'mon,
am I gonna get us a dump?

19:09.710 --> 19:12.747
Well, December 13, 1994.

19:12.810 --> 19:14.641
All right.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.211
NEWSCASTER: Dewar Lin_den
orIgInally enVISIoned hIs
masterpiece resort...

19:17.290 --> 19:20.453
Would you check this you out?
This guy's a total narcissist.

19:20.520 --> 19:21.953
...to the top of
the Himalayas...

19:22.020 --> 19:23.920
He makes his guests watch
his whole biography.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.457
...thri|ling rally racing.

19:25.530 --> 19:27.191
You'll find
The Sicilian offers

19:27.260 --> 19:29.490
a riveting experience
for everyone.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.067
Why don't you
make yourself useful, uh?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.792
Get me some sushi.
Couple of salmon rolls.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.733
McCloud lied.

19:42.810 --> 19:45.506
He said he hadn't talked
to Dewar Linden in
20 years, right?

19:45.580 --> 19:47.241
But I saw McCloud's
money cllp.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.244
It said
"Madrid to Marrakesh 2010".

19:50.320 --> 19:52.185
So, they were
at the same race.
That doesn't mean...

19:52.250 --> 19:54.218
It also said 152.

19:54.290 --> 19:57.953
Car 152. They were
in the same car, Al.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.794
Why would two
tycoons manufacture a feud?

20:05.300 --> 20:07.939
Business class.
ﬁrst was sold out.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.537
It sounds unspeakable.
I'm so sorry,

20:10.610 --> 20:12.339
but since you made
the sacrifice,

20:12.410 --> 20:15.072
maybe you can tell us why,
according to a witness,

20:15.140 --> 20:18.849
you and Thomas Warner were
duking it out two days before
he was murdered?

20:18.910 --> 20:20.411
Wait. You're accusing
me of murder?

20:20.480 --> 20:23.517
When we leave here,
which will be in
about 30 seconds,

20:23.590 --> 20:27.708
I'm filing a lawsuit
against you, NYPD,
and the city.

20:27.790 --> 20:30.213
Your tenure here
will be a short one.
Really?

20:30.290 --> 20:33.020
This kind of thing
never happened on
Eliot Delson's watch.

20:33.090 --> 20:34.193
He knew how to play ball.

20:34.260 --> 20:35.625
Oh, I know
how to play ball.

20:35.700 --> 20:37.668
I've played ball
with the IRS,

20:37.730 --> 20:40.460
who will be calling
about your client's
accounting practices.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.598
You're threatening me?

20:41.670 --> 20:43.729
I played ball with
the Housing Authority,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.835
who may wanna look
in to how Mr. Linden

20:45.910 --> 20:48.435
got the permits for
his latest project.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.444
I've played ball with
the media. The media...

20:50.510 --> 20:52.603
Relax. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:58.420 --> 20:59.910
What do you want?

20:59.990 --> 21:02.811
You and Shane McCloud
created a fake feud.

21:02.890 --> 21:05.654
Why

21:05.730 --> 21:07.152
Shane and I are best friends.

21:07.230 --> 21:09.551
Well, we didn't love
each other at first,

21:09.630 --> 21:12.167
but every lawsuit,
every fight,

21:12.230 --> 21:14.460
the more people started
staying at our places.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.599
Any PR is good PR.

21:16.670 --> 21:19.764
Like professional wrestling,
which I love,

21:19.840 --> 21:22.206
but you won.
Shane McCloud lost.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.669
Atlantic City will
be dead in two years.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.606
Cuba's opening up.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.978
Shane'll go there,
and in a year I'll show up

21:29.050 --> 21:31.211
in Havana and we'll start
the dance agaIn.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.518
No harm. No foul.

21:32.590 --> 21:35.058
Oh, except to the
dead architect.

21:35.120 --> 21:38.419
We checked out
all the plans in
Mr. Warner's office,

21:38.490 --> 21:40.856
guess which
one came up missing?

21:40.930 --> 21:43.194
The ones to your Sicilian.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.219
Taken by your best friend's
former head of security.

21:47.300 --> 21:50.736
My guess,
McCloud and Ganz killed
Warner for the plans

21:50.810 --> 21:54.109
and now they're planning
on taking down your casino.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.329
I don't believe it.

21:55.410 --> 21:58.846
Besides, The Sicilian
is heist-proof.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.049
You're willing
to bet everything
you've got on that?

22:05.690 --> 22:07.555
All I'm saying is,
I got all dressed up

22:07.620 --> 22:09.383
and you could have
sprung for valet.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.529
We didn't have to
park in the garage.

22:10.590 --> 22:11.682
For 60 bucks a night?

22:11.760 --> 22:14.228
It's not that much.
It's Ganz.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.571
When I see Ganz,
I'm gonna shoot him.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.448
I'm gonna catch him
and I'm gonna shoot him.

22:33.520 --> 22:35.476
You're sleeping on
the sofa tonight.
I'm taking the bed.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.142
No way, I booked the room.
You're on the couch.

22:37.220 --> 22:38.949
You know, be a gentleman.
I saved your life.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.180
That should
count for something.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.155
Ah, it's okay.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.564
Oh, you wouldn't wanna
shoot me, would ya?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.892
Is that
a rhetorical question?
Hmm.

22:55.970 --> 22:58.837
Wow. Nice suite.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.434
We've got this
under control.

23:00.510 --> 23:01.932
Yeah? Well,
if you have it under control,

23:02.010 --> 23:03.705
you know that
there's a murder suspect

23:03.780 --> 23:07.204
in Manhattan hanging
out in Atlantic City
shooting at cops.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.510
We know there's something
big going on down here.

23:09.580 --> 23:11.741
There is.
We think McCloud,

23:11.820 --> 23:13.811
Ganz and his crew
are gonna take down
The Sicilian.

23:15.190 --> 23:17.522
But McCloud
and Linden are friends.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.319
Well, I don't know
what they are,

23:19.390 --> 23:22.097
but Ganz stole _
the plans for thIs caSIno
from Warner's safe.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.866
Well, that's why
we're staying here.

23:23.930 --> 23:26.763
Oh! That's why you're here.
I figured as much.

23:27.700 --> 23:28.689
So, it's a heist.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.738
I love a good heist.

23:30.810 --> 23:34.075
So, other than this
romantic hideaway,
have you found anything?

23:34.140 --> 23:36.574
Did you find anybody
who had worked with Ganz
in the past?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.346
I mean, Jay said
he sent you some names.

23:38.410 --> 23:40.173
We're working some leads.
Hmm.

23:40.250 --> 23:44.084
If Ganz and his guys
are gonna hit this place,
odds are they'll be around.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.811
We'll keep our eyes open.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.619
CARRIE: In fact,
we should go
downstairs now.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.055
_ See what's
gomg on down there.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.212
I'm feeling luclq.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.451
You with the luck.
Oh, good, I can't wait.

23:52.530 --> 23:55.795
Well, I'm gonna have
to go sort things out
with the Atlantic City cops.

23:55.860 --> 23:56.997
And no gambling.

23:57.060 --> 23:58.095
Goes without saying.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.319
No, it does not.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.914
I covered for you there.

24:17.990 --> 24:21.153
But if your buddy
shows up again,
we got to come clean.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.414
Speaking of
coming clean,

24:22.490 --> 24:26.324
I may not be so welcome
at this casino either.

24:26.390 --> 24:28.199
The Sicilian's been
open for three weeks.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.898
How could you be
banned already?

24:29.960 --> 24:32.793
Well, two Saturdays ago,
I had an epic run
at the blackjack table.

24:32.870 --> 24:34.758
I just don't think
that they appreciated

24:34.840 --> 24:36.694
my card-playing methods,
so to speak.

24:36.770 --> 24:38.135
Two Saturdays ago,
I asked you to meet me

24:38.210 --> 24:39.529
at the park for
that music festival.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.009
You said you were sick.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.832
No, I said I'm really hot,
which technically

24:42.910 --> 24:45.674
was true because I
won 14 out of 16 hands.

24:45.750 --> 24:46.876
Technically,
you're full of shit.

24:49.380 --> 24:50.608
Damn it.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.009
Oh...

24:52.090 --> 24:53.216
CARRIE: Damn it.

24:54.490 --> 24:56.082
That's him, isn't it?

24:56.160 --> 24:57.923
The reasonably
good-looking guy
at the craps table...

24:57.990 --> 25:00.049
He's better than
reasonably good-looking, Al.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.688
Tell me everything.
Everything?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.421
Everything you know.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.923
CARRIE: Well, his name is
Hunter Ellis. He's...

25:06.000 --> 25:08.594
He's a good
strip-poker player.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.604
And he's a sucker
for pulling an
inside straight

25:10.670 --> 25:12.535
and he's kind of
a sucker for me.

25:12.610 --> 25:14.077
Not helpful.

25:14.140 --> 25:15.505
Nothing about him
and Ganz?

25:15.580 --> 25:17.548
Nothing that I know of.

25:17.610 --> 25:20.147
I'll have Jay
take a closer look.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.041
Keep an eye on your man.
Which one?

25:36.760 --> 25:39.092
Thanks, Mel.
Hey, Jay Bones.

25:39.170 --> 25:40.660
You got anything on this
Hunter Ellis guy yet?

25:40.740 --> 25:43.334
I sure do.
Guess who just got released
from federal prison

25:43.400 --> 25:45.300
in Allentown,
Pennsylvania two days ago?

25:45.370 --> 25:48.032
Oh, he got
restless quick, didn't he?
What was he in for?

25:48.110 --> 25:50.874
Nearly beat a guy to
death who disrespected
his girlfriend.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.702
Oh, my, a real romantic.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.839
But check this.
Hunter's been
a person of Interest

25:54.920 --> 25:56.342
for a series of
bank robberies

25:56.420 --> 25:58.809
and jewelry heists
in San Francisco, Chicago,
and Miami.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.849
Charges never stuck,
but it looks like he
planned those jobs.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.388
Denny, if Hunter Ellis
is involved in this,

26:05.460 --> 26:07.485
I don't think he's
working for Ganz.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.720
He's running the crew.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.468
Feeling luclq! Boom!

26:18.140 --> 26:20.358
There you go.
You're my good luck charm.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.476
Looks like you're having
a good night.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.799
It just got better.

26:27.850 --> 26:30.068
I'm on quite a streak here.
You should ride
me while I'm hot.

26:30.150 --> 26:33.654
I did that.
We got Interrupted,
remember?

26:33.720 --> 26:35.483
I'm a little offended
you're bettIng agaInst me.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.209
Ah...
Blow.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.287
I don't know you
well enough.

26:40.360 --> 26:42.419
For luck.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.161
Your luck's
about to change.

26:49.900 --> 26:52.698
Oh! Look at that.

26:52.770 --> 26:56.001
Buy me a drink to
help me get over
this crushing defeat?

26:56.080 --> 26:58.207
I'll give you a tip.
I'm gonna go to the bar

26:58.280 --> 27:00.305
and if you know
what's good for you,

27:00.380 --> 27:04.009
you're gonna walk
out of this casino
and get out of town.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.785
What if what's
good for me is you?

27:18.900 --> 27:21.460
So, there's an island...
Hmm.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.930
In the Caribbean.
DomInIca.

27:25.010 --> 27:29.299
White beaches,
amazing waterfalls.
Almost no people.

27:29.380 --> 27:30.677
Sounds like
my kind of place.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.502
Hmm. It could be
our kind of place.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.946
You should...

27:38.520 --> 27:40.511
You should come with me.

27:40.590 --> 27:42.285
Spend our days
on the beaches.

27:42.360 --> 27:45.989
Spend our nights
playing strip poker.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.358
I may even win a game.

27:48.430 --> 27:50.796
You could make
grass skIrts and sell
them to the tourists

27:50.870 --> 27:53.862
and I'll hunt and gather
so we can eat at night.

27:53.940 --> 27:56.033
Sounds like a plan.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.909
Yeah, except we'd go
stir crazy

27:57.970 --> 27:59.733
and after five days
we'd want to
kill each other.

27:59.810 --> 28:01.129
No way.
We would never fight.

28:01.210 --> 28:02.507
We're about to.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.212
RACHEL: Hey.
Hey.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.180
Just so you know,
the department's not paying

28:11.250 --> 28:13.309
for any spanktervision
you're buying up here.

28:13.390 --> 28:16.655
I wish you'd told me
that six hours ago.

28:16.720 --> 28:19.848
Jay tapped into
surveillance feeds
from around the casino.

28:19.930 --> 28:23.627
It's easier to spot
crewmembers from here
than walkIng around.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.099
They look cozy.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.667
Who's that with Carrie?

28:27.740 --> 28:29.731
Hunter Ellis.
Has a long sheet.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.267
Could be
involved in the heist.

28:31.340 --> 28:33.137
He took a shine to Carrie.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.405
Really?
How come I'm just
hearing about him now?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.539
She just remembered him
from a pile

28:37.610 --> 28:40.044
of photographs of
Ganz's associates.

28:40.110 --> 28:42.613
It's not that you have
a history of lying,

28:43.720 --> 28:45.688
but you have
a history of lying.

28:45.750 --> 28:46.887
We both do.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.851
RACHEL: If this guy
becomes a suspect,

28:51.930 --> 28:53.795
I'm taking her
off the case.

28:55.530 --> 28:59.125
Okay, that's Ganz's cousin,
Curtis, on the floor.

28:59.200 --> 29:01.794
He drove Ganz into New York
the night of the murder.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.964
Anything goes down,
he'll be involved.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.701
Well, he can
lead us to Ganz.

29:08.240 --> 29:10.105
All right,
I'm gonna go check this out.

29:10.180 --> 29:11.442
You keep an eye on her.

29:12.650 --> 29:13.639
Yep.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.683
Why are you here?

29:18.750 --> 29:21.958
It's like my home. I mean,
I've been coming
down here for years.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.453
When I was a kid,

29:23.520 --> 29:25.488
I used to sneak down

29:25.560 --> 29:27.425
on the bus from Philly.

29:27.490 --> 29:30.755
It's funny.
No one ever pays attention
to you on the bus.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.468
Ganz is a murderer.

29:34.700 --> 29:37.032
You know that, right?

29:37.100 --> 29:38.601
I haven't seen
that guy for years.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.729
Well, I just saw
him a few hours ago

29:40.810 --> 29:42.402
when he tried to shoot me.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.945
I had nothing
to do with that.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.483
I believe you.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.455
Give me Ganz.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.659
Give me Ganz and I will
leave Atlantic City

30:01.730 --> 30:05.461
and you will be free to do
whatever you want here.

30:05.530 --> 30:09.239
What makes you think
I couldn't do whatever
I want with you around?

30:09.300 --> 30:11.666
I'm a much better cop
than you are a criminal.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.470
Well,
I did come here to gamble.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.636
You don't_wanna
gamble WIth me.

30:18.850 --> 30:21.216
You'll lose again.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.781
You never know
who's watchIng.

30:31.090 --> 30:34.093
I'll give you
a little keepsake.

30:35.930 --> 30:37.454
Hang on.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.629
I gotta get the...

30:44.840 --> 30:46.034
There you go.

30:48.580 --> 30:52.038
So, am I gonna
see you again?

30:52.110 --> 30:53.646
For your sake, I hope not.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.712
You were getting pretty
cozy there with Ellis.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.781
I was marking
the suspect.

31:01.860 --> 31:03.452
You were doing
a lot more than that.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.624
Listen,
if Ellis is part of his crew,

31:05.690 --> 31:07.555
he will lead us
straight to Ganz.

31:07.630 --> 31:09.450
Why aren't we tailing him?

31:09.530 --> 31:12.192
As a matter of fact,
I hacked into his phone.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.593
We are tailing him.

31:30.550 --> 31:32.040
Looks like
Hunter's on the move.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.587
Hey, this could be
going down.

31:33.650 --> 31:34.912
All right, stay on him.
I'm gonna call Al.

31:34.990 --> 31:36.082
You got it.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.488
Hmm.

31:48.570 --> 31:52.336
Just like old times, huh?
You and I together,
working on a case.

31:52.410 --> 31:54.207
I told you,
I don't want to talk about
the Tendler case.

31:54.280 --> 31:57.306
I wasn't even
thinking about Tendler.
Apparently, you still are.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.678
The guy's about to
pull off a casino heist
and he comes out here.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.741
It doesn't make sense.

32:01.820 --> 32:04.311
Jay said he tracked his
phone right around here.
So, here we are.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.948
AL: All right,
I don't like this.

32:08.160 --> 32:11.186
NYPD! Get your hands up!
Get 'em up! Get 'em up!

32:11.260 --> 32:12.659
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

32:12.730 --> 32:14.527
That's it. C'mon.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.625
Let's go. Turn around.
What are you doing out here?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.827
I was told to be out here.

32:20.430 --> 32:21.829
Are either of you Carrie?

32:21.900 --> 32:23.094
Why?

32:27.270 --> 32:29.135
Where is he?
I have no clue.

32:29.210 --> 32:31.701
Yeah?
You need to think harder.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.247
This really
good-looking guy...

32:33.310 --> 32:35.312
He's not that
good-looking.

32:35.380 --> 32:37.348
Well, he gave me
$500 to come up here

32:37.420 --> 32:39.308
and give whoever
showed up the phone.

32:39.390 --> 32:41.915
$500. Said you'd
think it was hilarious.

32:41.990 --> 32:43.309
It's hysterical. Go.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.252
G0.
G0, 90, 90, 90!

32:48.730 --> 32:52.461
Carrie's boyfriend
is setting us up.
He is taunting us.

32:52.530 --> 32:55.067
Now we've lost his trail.
Yeah, Jay!

32:55.140 --> 32:56.960
You get eyes on
Hunter or his crew?

32:57.040 --> 32:59.338
No, he just sent us
on a wild goose chase.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.537
That's what I was afraid of
because I just got

33:01.610 --> 33:03.373
a report that
an industrial dry cleaner

33:03.440 --> 33:05.203
got burglarized
and cleaned out
a few hours ago.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.202
A dry cleaner?

33:07.280 --> 33:09.316
They handle large
businesses in the area,
including casinos.

33:09.380 --> 33:11.610
And get this,
it looks like
a bunch of uniforms

33:11.690 --> 33:13.487
from The Sicilian
were part of the haul.

33:13.550 --> 33:16.212
Those would come in handy
for anyone trying to take
down The Sicilian.

33:16.290 --> 33:17.712
I'll send you guys
and Carrie a list

33:17.790 --> 33:19.519
of all the customers
that had items taken.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.023
Thanks, Jay,
we'll get back to you.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.921
So, Hunter is playing us.
I want you to call Carrie.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.719
Tell her to meet
you at The Sicilian.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.131
And guess what?

33:28.200 --> 33:29.667
You're gonna take me
to the dry cleaners.

33:30.570 --> 33:31.605
Right.

33:36.610 --> 33:38.248
I told them no mayo.

33:38.310 --> 33:41.006
Don't worry
about the mayo, Ganz.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.049
Mayo on a burger?
You lose all your
taste buds in the joint?

33:45.120 --> 33:46.314
The joint.

33:47.620 --> 33:49.485
The place where
I spent months

33:49.560 --> 33:51.926
planning every detail
of this job?

33:51.990 --> 33:54.493
This operation that
you just put in jeopardy?
That one?

33:54.560 --> 33:57.324
You told me that
hotshot architect
wouldn't be at the office.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.324
What was I supposed to do
when he walked in?

34:00.400 --> 34:02.231
I got the plans, didn't I?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.666
Nobody gets hurt on my jobs.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.162
Yeah, well,
nobody would get rich

34:06.240 --> 34:09.209
if I didn't take out Warner.
I saved our asses.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.804
Warner was a visionary.

34:12.010 --> 34:13.477
The man created beauty.

34:14.850 --> 34:16.943
Then last night,

34:17.020 --> 34:19.318
you almost
destroyed more beauty.

34:19.390 --> 34:21.517
The redhead cop?
I heard about that.

34:23.460 --> 34:26.827
What did you think?
Did you think
that killing a cop

34:26.890 --> 34:30.155
was gonna make our job easier?
Is that what you thought?

34:30.230 --> 34:31.720
I was trying to
take the heat...

34:38.540 --> 34:41.737
If you so much as
look at her again,

34:43.680 --> 34:44.874
I will kill you.

34:47.680 --> 34:49.045
Now c'mon,
let's get to work.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.015
Oh, that's not good.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.208
What's going on?

34:55.290 --> 34:58.327
Power surges all
over Atlantic City.
It started 40 minutes ago.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.381
Servers are
crashing everywhere
including The Sicilian.

35:00.460 --> 35:04.396
Holy. Ellis must have
a hacker on his team, kid.
This is going down now.

35:06.530 --> 35:09.931
Now Sicilian
securIty conﬁrms
the servers are down,

35:10.000 --> 35:12.560
but report
nothing else is going on
out of the ordinary.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.108
Hunter should have
made his move by now.

35:15.180 --> 35:17.375
Maybe he's trying
to smoke us out.
See how much we know.

35:21.580 --> 35:23.775
Yes, I remember
all that cash.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.442
That's what you remember?

35:27.250 --> 35:30.651
That guy.
I saw him playing
penny slots

35:30.720 --> 35:33.359
at Arabian Kingdom.

35:33.430 --> 35:35.057
Maybe he's just changing up
places to gamble...

35:35.130 --> 35:37.928
No. No. There's only
one way to find out.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.243
NYPD. Keep your
hands on the car.

35:53.310 --> 35:56.143
Hunter got you
spying on me, huh?

35:56.220 --> 35:58.381
Where's Ganz, uh?
I want my lawyer.

35:58.450 --> 36:01.419
Yeah,
you'll get your lawyer.
He's good. Just this.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.822
Stay in the car.

36:07.890 --> 36:09.528
So, what are we
looking for in here?

36:15.340 --> 36:16.762
Al, I gotta make
a phone call.

36:18.740 --> 36:21.163
Jay. Hey, listen,
I've got this
poker chip here.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.401
It's got what I think
is the sketch of the

36:23.480 --> 36:25.402
original Arabian Kingdom
Casino on it.

36:25.480 --> 36:30.270
I saw the exact _same _
sketch on a cocktaII nakan
in Warner's safe.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.887
Didn't Linden
claim that The Sicilian

36:32.950 --> 36:35.009
was the only casino
in the world designed
by Warner?

36:35.090 --> 36:37.354
Find out who designed
The Arabian Kingdom.

36:38.160 --> 36:39.184
Okay.

36:40.890 --> 36:42.790
Got it.
It was designed in 1981

36:42.860 --> 36:44.794
by a firm,
Wellington and Towne.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.758
All right.
Anything about
Thomas Warner?

36:46.830 --> 36:50.368
Uh, let me cross-check
Warner with...

36:50.440 --> 36:52.567
Holy. Warner worked at
Wellington and Towne

36:52.640 --> 36:54.301
from 1978 to 1986.

36:54.380 --> 36:55.938
That's it.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.240
Warner designed
The Arabian Kingdom Casino,

36:58.310 --> 36:59.709
but he never got credit it.

36:59.780 --> 37:03.341
Maybe Hunter wasn't
only after the plans
to The Sicilian Casino.

37:03.420 --> 37:06.719
He wanted the blueprints
to The Arabian Kingdom
as well.

37:06.790 --> 37:08.678
The plans didn't
show up as missing
in Warner's safe

37:08.760 --> 37:10.648
because it wasn't
part of the Inventory.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.028
It was more like
a keepsake for Warner.

37:12.090 --> 37:16.652
Exactly right,
and The Arabian Kingdom
is right next door.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.618
That is Hunter's target.

37:27.540 --> 37:30.577
Our security system
went down 15 minutes ago.
We lost eyes down here.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.141
How much have
you got down here?

37:32.210 --> 37:34.849
All of it. Over 20 million.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.909
Oh!

37:49.700 --> 37:51.497
Stun grenade. They're fine.

37:55.070 --> 37:56.389
But we're too late.

38:02.810 --> 38:04.277
How the hell
did this happen?

38:13.050 --> 38:17.419
They got into
the secured areas of
The Sicilian posing as guards

38:17.490 --> 38:19.924
and then somehow
they get underneath
the casino. They dig down.

38:19.990 --> 38:21.753
They come up through
the floor in here.

38:21.830 --> 38:24.469
Does your casino connect
to The Sicilian in any way?

38:24.530 --> 38:26.395
It's that damn water
park Linden is building.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.358
He was digging
under his casino,
connecting to mine.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.499
He wants to put in a river
or caves or some shit.

38:30.570 --> 38:32.629
That's why he needed
both sets of plans.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.000
It can't be easy
moving that much money.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.547
They might still be here.

38:44.650 --> 38:45.639
Al.

38:48.190 --> 38:51.921
Have I ever let my
romantic relationships
get in the way of our cases?

38:54.260 --> 38:56.626
Yesterday there
were_slot machines
rIght there.

38:56.700 --> 39:00.158
This casino is
closmg tomorrow.
They're taking things out.

39:00.230 --> 39:02.391
Hey, excuse me.
What happened to the

39:02.470 --> 39:03.937
slot machines that
were there yesterday?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.729
The movers took 'em
off the floor earlier today.

39:05.810 --> 39:08.165
The movers?
Lorenzo Movers?

39:08.240 --> 39:09.935
Yeah, how'd you know?

39:10.010 --> 39:13.047
Al, listen to me.
That list Jay
sent us earlier.

39:13.110 --> 39:15.419
Lorenzo Movers
_ had a bunch of
unIforms stolen, rIght?

39:15.480 --> 39:16.913
What if that's
how they're getting
the money out,

39:16.980 --> 39:18.311
inside the slot machines?

39:18.390 --> 39:19.539
Where would they
take the slots out?

39:19.620 --> 39:20.712
The loading dock.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.036
Police! Freeze!
Don't move!

39:42.780 --> 39:44.133
I see Ganz. I don't see Ellis.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.541
Cover me.

40:01.460 --> 40:03.496
Put your hands up!
Hands where I
can see 'em, now!

40:03.560 --> 40:05.460
All right. Get out, c'mon.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.291
Where's Hunter Ellis?

40:11.370 --> 40:12.906
He's long gone.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.507
HUNTER: I mean,
I've been coming down
here for years.

40:15.580 --> 40:19.698
As a kid,
I used to sneak down here
on the bus from Philly.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.748
No one ever pays
attention to you on the bus.

40:25.690 --> 40:28.818
Al, I think
I know where he is.
You got this?

40:28.890 --> 40:29.914
I got it.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.967
You weren't gonna
say goodbye?

40:49.840 --> 40:53.549
That stupid story
I told you about taking
the bus as a kid, right?

40:53.610 --> 40:56.078
You didn't really
think you were gonna
beat me, did you?

40:56.820 --> 40:58.071
I can't go back.

40:58.150 --> 41:00.687
And I told you I
would take you down.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.581
You remember
that island?

41:02.660 --> 41:03.888
Dominica?

41:03.960 --> 41:07.020
You could have
a drink waiting for you.
A deck of cards.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.093
We'd make
a pretty good team.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.821
In another life maybe.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.705
She's a beautiful woman.

41:26.550 --> 41:28.177
Yeah, I'm a luclq man.

41:29.650 --> 41:31.277
Not that luclq.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.479
Come on.

41:46.330 --> 41:48.798
Ellis really
thought he'd beat you.

41:48.870 --> 41:50.997
Yeah, well,
not a smart move on his part.

41:51.070 --> 41:53.732
In his defense,
he didn't know about
your secret weapon.

41:53.810 --> 41:54.936
He knew about
my memory.

41:55.010 --> 41:57.228
I meant me!

41:57.310 --> 42:00.006
Okay, secret weapon.
What now?

42:00.080 --> 42:02.275
We're in
America's playground.
Maybe we should play.

42:02.350 --> 42:03.544
We still have
that hotel suite.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.815
Well, you have
a one-track mind.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.141
Tell me you weren't
on the same track.

42:07.220 --> 42:09.313
All right, fine.
Let's leave it up to chance.

42:09.390 --> 42:11.085
Red, we go home.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.889
Black?

42:12.960 --> 42:14.951
We go up to
the hotel suite.
Let's do it.

42:15.030 --> 42:17.555
I'm feeling luclq.
All right.

42:17.630 --> 42:19.689
DEALER:
All right, no more bets.
