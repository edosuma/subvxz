"D" IS SCARED OF A LITTLE TINY

11:28.788 --> 11:29.822
BEATLE.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.658
IT'S JUST A TYPICAL DAY IN THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

11:32.658 --> 11:35.995
>> WHAT TOOK OUT BIG "D"?

11:35.995 --> 11:36.395
A BEETLE?

11:36.395 --> 11:39.131
>> OH, MY GOD!

11:39.131 --> 11:43.235
>> Julie: UP NEXT, TIME FOR
THE COOKOUT TO MAKE SOME

11:43.235 --> 11:44.737
DIFFICULT CHOICES.

11:44.737 --> 11:48.908
THEN, SARAH BETH AND KYLAND, ONE
OF THIS SUMMER'S CLOSEST DUOS,

11:48.908 --> 11:51.577
WILL BE PARTING WAYS TONIGHT.

11:51.577 --> 11:56.082
AND WE CHECK IN WITH BRITINI AND
DEREK X. AS THEY MOVE INTO THE

11:56.082 --> 11:57.149
JURY HOUSE.

11:57.149 --> 12:01.887
PLUS, WHO WILL REPLACE SECRET
H.O.H. CLAIRE?

12:01.887 --> 12:05.391
ANOTHER EPIC BATTLE OF ENDURANCE
BEGINS TONIGHT.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.425
STAY WITH US.

12:20.706 --> 12:23.409
WITH LESS THAN A MONTH LEFT IN
THE GAME, THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED

12:23.409 --> 12:27.413
FOR THE COOKOUT TO CHOOSE WHO
WITHIN THEIR RANKS WILL BE THE

12:27.413 --> 12:34.854
FIRST TO GO.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.088
>> ALMOST THERE.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.425
>> I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT'S JUST
THE SIX OF US, WE AIN'T GOT TO

12:39.425 --> 12:43.362
WHISPER NO MORE.

12:43.362 --> 12:47.166
>> PART OF WHY THE COOKOUT IS
SUCCESSFULLY HIDDEN IS BECAUSE

12:47.166 --> 12:51.337
THE SIX OF US HAVE NEVER BEEN
ALONE IN A ROOM TOGETHER.

12:51.337 --> 12:57.343
>> I WISH THEY WOULD COME IN AND
TAKE PICTURES OF US AND BE ON A

12:57.343 --> 12:59.245
MAGAZINE COVER-- "FINAL SIX."

12:59.245 --> 13:03.282
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE DON'T
SEE, PUTTING IT OUT IN THE

13:03.282 --> 13:04.416
UNIVERSE.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.920
IT'S JUST SO FUNNY HOE IT'S
JUST-- IT'S JUST IN FRONT OF

13:07.920 --> 13:12.057
THEIR FACES.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.093
>> WHOA
( LAUGHING )

13:14.093 --> 13:18.063
>> NEVER HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

13:18.063 --> 13:18.898
NEVER.

13:18.898 --> 13:23.002
>> I WANT TO WAKE HIM UP SO BAD.

13:23.002 --> 13:26.939
>> GO GET HIM.

13:26.939 --> 13:35.214
"X," I REALLY NEED TO TALK TO
YOU.

13:35.214 --> 13:39.285
>> WE'VE NEVER DONE THIS.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.687
>> WE CAN MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

13:41.687 --> 13:43.556
WE'RE READY TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.456
COOKOUT ON THREE.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.091
ONE, TWO, THREE.

13:46.091 --> 13:46.625
COOKOUT!

13:46.625 --> 13:48.427
>> THIS MAN'S ASLEEP.

13:48.427 --> 13:49.762
HE'S GOING TO KILL US.

13:49.762 --> 13:54.099
>> EVEN,000 THE COOKOUT HAS BEEN
OFFICIAL SINCE WEEK ONE, IT

13:54.099 --> 13:56.969
FEELS GOOD TO MAKE IT OFFICIALLY
OFFICIAL.

13:56.969 --> 14:00.673
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, ONLY
ONE MEMBER OF THE COOKOUT WILL

14:00.673 --> 14:06.078
BE GETTING RAINED IN CONFETTI ON
FINALE NIGHT, AND I PLAN THAT TO

14:06.078 --> 14:06.478
BE ME.

14:06.478 --> 14:07.146
>> I LOVE YOU.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.847
>> I'M GOING TO BED.

14:08.847 --> 14:13.385
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.321
>> OH, THERE HE IS.

14:15.321 --> 14:16.956
FINALLY.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.491
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING FOR
NEXT WEEK?

14:19.491 --> 14:20.626
>> YOU.

14:20.626 --> 14:24.930
YOU'VE TOLD ME THAT YOU WOULD
ONLY BE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT

14:24.930 --> 14:28.334
CLAIRE BUT NOT NECESSARILY
ALYSSA.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.536
I DON'T REALLY CARE AT THIS
POINT IF I WIN H.O.H.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.739
I WAS GOING TO THROW BOTH OF
THEIR ASSES UP THERE.

14:33.739 --> 14:34.807
>> THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.343
>> THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS THE
BEST-CASE SCENARIO.

14:37.343 --> 14:41.580
I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL ON
THE SAME PAGE BECAUSE AT THE END

14:41.580 --> 14:45.284
OF THE DAY THERE ARE SO MANY
WOMEN ON JURY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO

14:45.284 --> 14:46.418
LOSE ANY OF US.

14:46.418 --> 14:52.424
>> ONCE IT GETS DOWN TO SIX,
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE MORE

14:52.424 --> 14:53.459
CUTTHROAT.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.794
THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK AT US AND
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

14:55.794 --> 15:03.836
>> I THINK A BENEFIT OF BRINGING
KYLAND AND BIG "D" TO THE FINAL

15:03.836 --> 15:05.004
2.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.339
I SEE POTENTIALLY BRINGING
TIFFANY AND HANNAH TO THE FINAL

15:07.339 --> 15:10.309
THREE, BECAUSE I THINK FROM AN
OVERALL GAME PERSPECTIVE, I HAVE

15:10.309 --> 15:12.411
BEEN OVERALL IN THE GAME THAN
THEY HAVE.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.214
>> THEY WILL MAKE SURE YOU TAKE
SHOTS AT EACH OTHER, AND IT WILL

15:15.214 --> 15:17.783
BE EASY TO TAKE UP ON THE BIG
"D" AFTER THAT.

15:17.783 --> 15:18.083
>> 100%.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.318
>> 100%.

15:19.318 --> 15:23.222
>> ONE THING I'M TRYING NOT TO
DO IS HAVE EITHER OF YOUR NAMES

15:23.222 --> 15:23.756
IN MY MOUTH.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.723
>> I AGREE WITH THAT.

15:24.723 --> 15:27.326
>> THE THREE GUYS LOOKING OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.994
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.997
I LOVE DEREK F., BUT HE'S
DEFINITELY SOMEONE I'M KEEPING

15:31.997 --> 15:33.165
MY EYE ON.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.267
EVEN THOUGH HE SAYS HE HAS MY
BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE END,

15:35.267 --> 15:38.037
IT'S HARD NOT TO ASSUME HE'S
HAVING A VERY SIMILAR

15:38.037 --> 15:42.041
CONVERSATION WITH OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE SIX.

15:42.041 --> 15:45.010
>> IT'S HARD FOR ANYONE TO BREAK
US APART.

15:45.010 --> 15:45.311
>> EXACTLY.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.512
>> OKAY.

15:46.512 --> 15:49.481
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, I KNOW
KYLAND IS NOT GOING TO TAKE

15:49.481 --> 15:51.984
XAVIER, AND XAVIER IS NOT GOING
TO TAKE KYLAND.

15:51.984 --> 15:55.054
SO I'M THE ONLY OPTION TO TAKE
TO THE FINAL TWO.

15:55.054 --> 15:56.855
THIS MOUTH RIGHT HERE IS
DANGEROUS.

15:56.855 --> 16:00.926
AND I KNOW I COULD DEBATE,
ARGUE, CONVINCE, DO WHATEVER IT

16:00.926 --> 16:02.461
TAKES, AND TAKE IT HOME.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.029
AND I CAN WIN THAT MONEY.

16:04.029 --> 16:07.666
WE'RE ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH,
THEN EVERYTHING ELSE SHOULD BE

16:07.666 --> 16:08.867
THE WAY IT SHOULD GO.

16:08.867 --> 16:13.138
WHEN WE'RE NOT, THAT'S WHEN WE
END UP GETTING OUR ASSES SENT

16:13.138 --> 16:13.906
HOME AND LOOKING STUPID.

16:13.906 --> 16:20.045
>> YEAH.

16:20.713 --> 16:28.487
>> WE HAVE TO GET RID OF BIG
"D."

16:28.487 --> 16:31.090
>> IF BIG "D" DON'T GO, THAT
MEANS ME OR YOU.

16:31.090 --> 16:32.791
>> YOU'RE THE BIGGEST TARGET.

16:32.791 --> 16:38.430
AND I'M THE NEXT BIGGEST TARGET.

16:38.430 --> 16:48.474
>> BIGGEST CHALLENGE AFTER THAT
IS "X."

16:48.474 --> 17:03.956
>> BIGGEST CHALLENGE AFTER THAT
IS "X."

17:03.956 --> 17:07.826
> MY TRUE FINAL TWO IS
WITHATIVE FEE.

17:07.826 --> 17:10.229
THAT BEING SAID, I'M ALL VERY
CLOSE TO XAVIER.

17:10.229 --> 17:14.032
BOTH OF THEM HAVE GAMES I
RESPECT, AND I GO BACK AND FORTH

17:14.032 --> 17:18.070
A LOT AS TO WHO I CAN ACTUALLY
TRUST IN TERMS OF HAVING A FINAL

17:18.070 --> 17:19.104
TWO WITH ME.

17:19.104 --> 17:25.077
FOR FINAL TWO, I'M TRADING
LOYALTY FOR LOYALTY.

17:25.077 --> 17:37.189
>> I AM LOCKED IN WHEN I'M
LOYAL.

17:37.189 --> 17:40.459
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN AFFORD
TO BE ON THE BLOCK AGAIN AFTER

17:40.459 --> 17:41.693
THIS WEEK.

17:41.693 --> 17:45.063
AT THIS POINT, I'M JUST TRYING
TO SET MYSELF UP TO GIVE MYSELF

17:45.063 --> 17:53.605
WANT BEST POSSIBLE SHOT TO SIT
IN ONE OF THOSE FINAL TWO

17:53.605 --> 17:53.806
CHAIRS.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.595
>> Julie: UP NEXT, THE COOKOUT
MAY BE A SECRET IN THE "BIG

18:16.595 --> 18:20.632
BROTHER" HOUSE, BUT IN THE JURY
HOUSE, THE PUZZLE PIECES ARE

18:20.632 --> 18:22.768
BEGINNING TO BE PUT TOGETHER.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.470
STAY WITH US.

18:51.096 --> 18:55.400
HAVING SPENT A WEEK IN THE JURY
HOUSE ALONE, THE LAST PERSON

18:55.400 --> 19:01.340
BRITINI EXPECTED TO SEE WAS
DEREK X. WALKING THROUGH THE

19:01.340 --> 19:04.743
DOOR.

19:04.743 --> 19:07.312
>> YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT ME FOR
DAYS!

19:07.312 --> 19:08.614
GUESS WHAT?

19:08.614 --> 19:12.184
NO MORE!

19:12.184 --> 19:15.053
GETTING EVICTED FROM THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE IS DEFINITELY A

19:15.053 --> 19:15.721
BITTERSWEET EXPERIENCE.

19:15.721 --> 19:16.622
I'M STILL NOT OUT OF THE GAME.

19:16.622 --> 19:19.057
I GET A VOTE IN THIS JURY.

19:19.057 --> 19:22.327
I GET TO CHOOSE WHO WINS THIS
MONEY AND THEY'VE GOT SOME

19:22.327 --> 19:23.161
IMPRESSING TO DO.

19:23.161 --> 19:24.396
THAT'S RIGHT!

19:24.396 --> 19:24.897
THERE!

19:24.897 --> 19:26.098
MAN, I NEED FRIENDS!

19:26.098 --> 19:31.336
I THINK THE NEXT JUROR IS GOING
TO BE ALYSSA, SARAH BETH OR

19:31.336 --> 19:31.837
KYLAND.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.971
I HOPE THE LAST ONE.

19:32.971 --> 19:33.805
THAT'S ONE.

19:33.805 --> 19:39.912
>> THE LORD OF THE LATRINE HAS
ARRIVED.

19:39.912 --> 19:40.946
>> NO!

19:40.946 --> 19:43.248
>> I HAVE SO-- HERE.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.416
>> NO!

19:44.416 --> 19:47.653
>> BEING THE SECOND ONE IN THE
JURY, WHEN I FELT LIKE I WAS

19:47.653 --> 19:51.623
PLAYING A PRETTY DECENT GAME, IT
DEFINITELY SUCKS.

19:51.623 --> 19:54.092
AND ON TOP OF THAT, THERE WERE
THINGS THAT I COULD HAVE DONE

19:54.092 --> 19:59.231
AND SHOULD HAVE DONE, HONESTLY,
TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.099
BUT--
>> OKAY, I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE

20:01.099 --> 20:02.768
YOU BUT I'M NOT HAPPY YOU'RE
HERE.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.936
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:03.936 --> 20:07.339
>> I'M ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED TO SEE
DEREK X. IN THIS HOUSE.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.875
DEFINITELY NOT WHO I WANTED TO
SEE COMING THROUGH THE DOORS

20:09.875 --> 20:10.809
THIS DAY.

20:10.809 --> 20:12.344
I DEFINITELY DID NOT EXPECT TO
SEE HIM HERE.

20:12.344 --> 20:12.811
WHO WAS H.O.H.?

20:12.811 --> 20:14.079
>> I'LL SHOW YOU.

20:14.079 --> 20:14.546
I'LL SHOW YOU.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.447
>> LET'S GO WATCH.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.183
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

20:18.183 --> 20:18.984
>>
>> OH!

20:18.984 --> 20:20.519
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

20:20.519 --> 20:22.154
>> LET ME SHOW YOU HOW CRAZY
THIS WEEK WAS.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.156
>> HOW DID YOU END UP HERE?

20:24.156 --> 20:24.923
>> OKAY.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.325
>> GOOD JOB, S.B.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.861
>> THIS IS THE H.O.H. THAT I
MISSED?

20:29.861 --> 20:30.596
A BALANCE BEAM!

20:30.596 --> 20:31.196
>> I KNOW.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.031
>> THIS IS MY COMP.

20:33.031 --> 20:34.166
>> NICE!

20:34.166 --> 20:35.867
( BELL RINGS ).

20:35.867 --> 20:38.870
>> Julie: WOW, THAT WILL DO
IT, 21.03 SECONDS.

20:38.870 --> 20:41.473
>> PLEASE TELL ME-- NO!

20:41.473 --> 20:44.743
>> QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.478
COME ON
( BUZZER ).

20:46.478 --> 20:48.113
>> Julie: SO CLOSE, BUT I'M
SORRY.

20:48.113 --> 20:49.381
>> NO!

20:49.381 --> 20:50.115
OH, MY GOD.

20:50.115 --> 20:53.051
YOU LITERALLY WOULD HAVE HAD
HER.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.653
>> Julie: CONGRATULATIONS,
SARAH BETH, YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD

20:54.653 --> 20:55.887
OF HOUSEHOLD.

20:55.887 --> 20:58.890
>> SO I'M THINKING, ALL RIGHT,
IT'S NOT GREAT THEY LOST, BUT I

20:58.890 --> 21:00.626
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THAT BAD
THAT SHE WON.

21:00.626 --> 21:05.831
>> THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS...

21:05.831 --> 21:11.303
THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST I HAVE
NOMINATED IS...

21:11.303 --> 21:14.039
>> NO.

21:14.039 --> 21:15.273
YOU'RE A BACKDOOR.

21:15.273 --> 21:19.878
>> CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE WAS
PLAYED IN THE HIGH ROLLS' ROOM,

21:19.878 --> 21:21.013
AND THERE WAS A WINNER.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.049
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THIS IS
BASICALLY THE TURNING POINT OF

21:24.049 --> 21:24.349
THE WEEK.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.450
>> OKAY.

21:25.450 --> 21:29.554
>> WHERE MY ENTIRE GAME WENT
WRONG WAS BELIEVING THAT I

21:29.554 --> 21:32.557
DIDN'T NEED TO PLAY THAT
ROULETTE WHEEL.

21:32.557 --> 21:36.962
>> WITH A HIGH SCORE OF 19, THE
WINNER IS...

21:36.962 --> 21:37.596
ALYSSA!

21:37.596 --> 21:39.097
( APPLAUSE )
>> YAY!

21:39.097 --> 21:40.732
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

21:40.732 --> 21:45.170
>> I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE DEREK
OFF THE BLOCK.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.005
>> SHE TAKES OFF BIG "D."

21:47.005 --> 21:50.075
>> OH, MY GOD!

21:50.075 --> 21:52.444
WE WERE OUTPLAYED SO HARD THIS
WEEK.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.781
>> ALL ELIGIBLE HOUSEGUESTS HAVE
AN EQUAL NUMBER OF SPOTS ON THE

21:55.781 --> 21:56.948
WHEEL.

21:56.948 --> 21:59.651
ALYSSA WILL SPIN THE ROULETTE
WHEEL AND WHEREVER THE BALL

21:59.651 --> 22:04.723
LANDS, THAT PERSON WILL BECOME
THE NEW NOMINEE.

22:04.723 --> 22:09.561
THE BALL HAS LANDED ON XAVIER
( GASPS )

22:09.561 --> 22:11.863
>> YOU ARE NOW NOMINATED FOR
EVICTION.

22:11.863 --> 22:12.831
>> OH, MY GOD!

22:12.831 --> 22:14.800
>> PLEASE TAKE A SEAT IN THE
NOMINATION CHAIR.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.338
>> GOING INTO THE HIGH ROLLERS'
ROOM, I ALREADY HAD $100.

22:20.338 --> 22:24.576
IF I GOT $100 I WAS DEFINITELY
GOING TO KEEP SAVING.

22:24.576 --> 22:27.779
IF YOU GET TWO $100 IN A ROW,
YOU GET TO PLAY THE COIN FLIP.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.848
>> WHAT DID YOU GET?

22:29.848 --> 22:30.415
>> 100.

22:30.415 --> 22:31.283
>> I KNOW!

22:31.283 --> 22:32.918
>> THAT MEANS AMERICA LOVES YOU.

22:32.918 --> 22:35.087
>> OR AMERICA SAW WHAT WE WERE
MISSING.

22:35.087 --> 22:40.892
OBVIOUSLY, SITTING HERE NOW, OF
COURSE, I WISH I IT USED BY B.B.

22:40.892 --> 22:43.962
BUCKS TO PLAY THE ROULETTE
WHEEL, BUT IF I GO BACK TO THAT

22:43.962 --> 22:47.532
MOMENT IN TIME AND THINK ABOUT
THE REASONS WHY I MADE THAT

22:47.532 --> 22:48.834
DECISION, I DON'T THINK MY
REASONING WAS INVALID.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.869
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED IN
VETO?

22:50.869 --> 22:51.470
>> DID YOU PLAY?

22:51.470 --> 22:53.772
>> I DIDN'T GET SELECTED.

22:53.772 --> 22:58.110
>> XAVIER HAS WON THE GOLDEN
POWER OF VETO.

22:58.110 --> 23:08.687
( APPLAUSE )
>> DEREK X. PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

23:08.687 --> 23:14.726
>> Julie: BY A VOTE OF 5-2,
BABY "D," YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

23:14.726 --> 23:16.695
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

23:16.695 --> 23:18.029
>> OH, MY GOD.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.231
>> THAT'S HOW I LEFT.

23:19.231 --> 23:23.001
I WAS JUST REALLY CONFUSED ON
WHY MY ARGUMENTS WEREN'T GOING

23:23.001 --> 23:24.236
THROUGH TO THEM.

23:24.236 --> 23:28.974
BUT THEN IT ALL MADE SENSE ONCE
I HEARD THE GOOD-BYE MESSAGES.

23:28.974 --> 23:31.243
>> WHAT WERE THE GOOD-BYE
MESSAGES?

23:31.243 --> 23:33.879
>> ALL WERE NORMAL, EXCEPT FOR
KY'S.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.515
>> I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A
GROUP OF PEOPLE SINCE WEEK ONE

23:36.515 --> 23:40.385
THAT HAS MANAGED TO KEEP ALL OF
OUR MEMBERS STILL IN THE HOUSE.

23:40.385 --> 23:40.919
>> WOW!

23:40.919 --> 23:41.987
>> AND I BELIEVE IT.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.189
>> WHO IS IN THE ALLIANCE?

23:44.189 --> 23:45.157
DID HE TELL YOU WHO?

23:45.157 --> 23:47.392
>> HE DIDN'T SAY ANY NAMES.

23:47.392 --> 23:53.331
I THINK THAT MAYBE KYLAND, "X,"
TIFFANY, AZAH, AND THEN THE ONES

23:53.331 --> 23:56.635
I'M IFFY ON ARE HANNAH AND BIG
"D."

23:56.635 --> 23:59.638
>> YOU DON'T THINK HANNAH WOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU THOUGH?

23:59.638 --> 24:01.706
>> THAT'S THE THING, I THINK
HANNAH WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

24:01.706 --> 24:06.778
>> I DON'T-- I DON'T THINK BIG
"D'S" IN IT.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.314
AZAH'S GOT BIG "D."

24:09.314 --> 24:15.821
"X" HAS ALYSSA "X" HAS CLAIRE.

24:15.821 --> 24:17.222
>> THEY ALL HAVE SOMEONE.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.456
>> THEY ALL HAVE SOMEONE.

24:18.456 --> 24:20.425
>> THEY'RE PLAYING A REALLY GOOD
GAME.

24:20.425 --> 24:23.528
HERE'S MY CONSPIRACY, AMERICA.

24:23.528 --> 24:28.133
KY, "X," TIFFANY, AZAH, THESE
FOUR HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER

24:28.133 --> 24:29.401
SINCE WEEK ONE.

24:29.401 --> 24:33.939
AND EACH ONE OF THEM ARE IN THIS
ALLIANCE, BUT ALSO SHIELDEDLY BY

24:33.939 --> 24:35.307
THEIR DUO.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.910
SO IF THEY EVER HIT THE BLOCK,
THEY'LL BE PUT UP NEXT TO THEIR

24:38.910 --> 24:41.913
DUO, AND THEY HAVE THE VOTES TO
SEND THE DUO MEMBER HOME.

24:41.913 --> 24:46.952
IT'S HONESTLY EXTREMELY GENIUS,
AND I CAN JUST ONLY GIVE PROPS

24:46.952 --> 24:48.086
TO THEM.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.555
I THINK BETWEEN TWO OF US, WE
CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH OTHER

24:50.555 --> 24:52.357
PLAYERS MIGHT ALSO NUMBER THIS
ALLIANCE.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.391
>> ABSOLUTELY.

24:53.391 --> 24:55.527
AND YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING
TO FIGURE THAT OUT?

24:55.527 --> 24:57.329
IN THE HOT TUB!

24:57.329 --> 24:58.697
>> LET'S DO IT.

24:58.697 --> 25:01.700
>> Julie: WHEN WE RETURN, IT'S
TIME TO SEND ANOTHER HOUSEGUEST

25:01.700 --> 25:04.236
TO THE JURY HOUSE.

25:04.236 --> 25:08.740
THEN, THE BATTLE TO BECOME THE
NEW H.O.H. BEGINS.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.141
STAY WITH US.

HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.501
>> Julie: SARAH BETH, I CAN

25:36.501 --> 25:38.536
HOUSEMATES WILL CAST THEIR VOTES

25:38.536 --> 25:41.239
BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH HAVE A
FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY THEIR VOTES

25:41.239 --> 25:42.474
WITH ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.408
SARAH BETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.143
>> HI, FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.379
I MISS YOU DEARLY.

25:47.379 --> 25:50.615
HOUSEGUESTS, IF YOU'RE THINKING
OF EVICTING ME TONIGHT, ALL I'M

25:50.615 --> 25:52.150
ASKING IS THAT YOU RECONSIDER
FOR A MOMENT.

25:52.150 --> 25:56.688
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONABLE,
TACTICAL REASONS TO KEEP ME IN

25:56.688 --> 25:57.889
THE GAME.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.525
I KNOW IF I WALK UP ON THE THE
DOOR TONIGHT, SOME OF YOU ARE

26:00.525 --> 26:03.828
GOING TO LOOK AT THIS MOMENT AND
YOU'RE GOING TO THINK, MAN, THAT

26:03.828 --> 26:06.698
WASN'T THE BECHT DECISION FOR MY
GAME.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.634
AND I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO
MAKE A DECISION AND REGRET IT

26:09.634 --> 26:10.635
LATER.

26:10.635 --> 26:13.305
IT'S AWFUL, AND I DON'T WISH IT
FOR ANY OF YOU.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.374
SO, PLEASE, ALL I'M ASKING IS
PLEASE TAKE ONE MORE MOMENT TO

26:16.374 --> 26:19.144
CONSIDER WHAT IS GOOD AND WHAT
IS SAFE FOR YOUR INDIVIDUAL GAME

26:19.144 --> 26:19.978
BEFORE YOU MAKE A DECISION.

26:19.978 --> 26:22.514
IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO CHANGE
YOUR MIND.

26:22.514 --> 26:25.417
REGARDLESS, I'M PLAYING A GAME
THAT I LOVE WITH PEOPLE THAT I

26:25.417 --> 26:27.252

SOMETIMES.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.218
I'LL TRY NOT TO DO THIS HERE.

>> I THINK THAT PEOPLE ENDED UP
SEEING ME AS MORE OF A THREAT IN

32:58.242 --> 32:59.410
THE HOUSE.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.878
I THINK MAYBE SOME OF THE
HOUSEGUESTS DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH

33:00.878 --> 33:04.248
THEY COULD TRUST ME OR WHO I
WOULD CHOOSE TO WORK WITH, BUT

33:04.248 --> 33:07.285
THEY COULD SEE ME POTENTIALLY
WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND

33:07.285 --> 33:08.419
GOING AGAINST THEM.

33:08.419 --> 33:11.456
WHEREAS, KYLAND MIGHT HAVE SEEN
MORE LIKE HE WOULD BE BY

33:11.456 --> 33:12.657
HIMSELF.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.792
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT ENDED UP LEADING TO IT.

33:14.792 --> 33:18.129
>> Julie: LET'S TALK ABOUT
YOUR FINAL PLEA SPEECH FOR

33:18.129 --> 33:18.429
VOTES.

33:18.429 --> 33:19.630
>> YES.

33:19.630 --> 33:21.699
>> Julie: IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU
WERE REFERRING TO-- IT SOUNDED

33:21.699 --> 33:25.536
LIKE YOU WERE REGRETTING WHEN
YOU WERE H.O.H. YOU WENT AFTER

33:25.536 --> 33:28.139
DEREK X. TO GET HIM EVICTED.

33:28.139 --> 33:28.906
AM I RIGHT?

33:28.906 --> 33:30.742
IS THAT WHO YOU WERE REFERRING
TO?

33:30.742 --> 33:32.877
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T REGRET THAT
SO MUCH.

33:32.877 --> 33:36.114
I REGRET BEING SO OBVIOUS WITH
MY LOYALTY TO KYLAND.

33:36.114 --> 33:39.817
AND I REGRET NOT PLAYING MORE
LOYAL TO TIFFANY AND CLAIRE,

33:39.817 --> 33:42.720
BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN BTTER FOR MY GAME OVERALL.

33:42.720 --> 33:46.657
I STAND BY MY DECISION TO GET
RID OF DEREK X.

33:46.657 --> 33:47.392
>> Julie: OKAY.

33:47.392 --> 33:49.527
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU AND KYLAND.

33:49.527 --> 33:52.196
IT LOOKED LIKE THE TWO OF YOU
WERE INSEPARABLE IN THE HOUSE.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.431
>> I KNOW.

33:53.431 --> 33:56.267
>> Julie: SO THAT BEING SAID,
I MEAN, HE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND

33:56.267 --> 33:57.001
IN THE HOUSE, YES?

33:57.001 --> 33:58.136
>> YES.

33:58.136 --> 34:00.238
>> Julie: SO HOW HARD WAS THIS
WEEK SITTING NEXT TO HOIM

34:00.238 --> 34:04.542
KNOWING ONE OF US HAS TO GO, OR
EVEN MAKING THAT SPEECH JUST

34:04.542 --> 34:05.109
NOW?

34:05.109 --> 34:06.411
HARD WAS-- WAS IT HARD?

34:06.411 --> 34:10.815
>> IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT, "BUT
KYLAND IS A REALLY EASY PERSON

34:10.815 --> 34:11.983
TO PLAY WITH.

34:11.983 --> 34:16.554
HE KNEW HOW HARD I WANTED TO BE
HERE AND HE NEVER TOOK MY

34:16.554 --> 34:18.923
CAMPAIGNING FOR MYSELF WAS
PERSONAL.

34:18.923 --> 34:22.226
IT WAS STILL VERY DIFFICULT BUT
I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR KYLAND FOR

34:22.226 --> 34:23.227
UNDERSTANDING MY POSITION.

34:23.227 --> 34:25.696
>> Julie: WHO DO YOU THINK THE
SECRET H.O.H. IS?

34:25.696 --> 34:29.133
>> I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S TIFFANY
OR CLAIRE.

34:29.133 --> 34:33.371
>> Julie: WHO DO YOU THINK
GAVE YOU THE ONE VOTE-- WHO DO

34:33.371 --> 34:36.374
YOU THINK WAS THE ONE VOTE TO
VOTE OUT KYLAND AND NOT YOU?

34:36.374 --> 34:38.643
>> I KNOW THAT IT WAS TIFFANY.

34:38.643 --> 34:42.914
KYLAND TOLD ME BEFORE, AND SHE
ACTUALLY WHISPERED TO ME WHEN I

34:42.914 --> 34:45.082
HUGGED HER GOOD-BYE THAT SHE WAS
THE VOTE FOR ME.

34:45.082 --> 34:46.918
>> Julie: DO YOU WANT TO
LISTEN TO YOUR GOOD-BYE

34:46.918 --> 34:47.518
MESSAGES?

34:47.518 --> 34:48.319
>> YES.

34:48.319 --> 34:49.554
> Julie: LET'S DO IT RIGHT
OVER HERE.

34:49.554 --> 34:53.724
>> SARAH BETH, I WAS THE
ANONYMOUS H.O.H., AND I DID PUT

34:53.724 --> 34:56.160
YOU AND KYLAND UP INTENDING TO
SPLIT YOU UP.

34:56.160 --> 34:59.564
THIS IS REALLY A MOVE OF
RESPECT.

34:59.564 --> 34:59.964
IT'S NOT PERSONAL.

34:59.964 --> 35:00.431
BEST WISHES.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.633
>> HI, SARAH BETH.

35:02.633 --> 35:04.936
WHEN YOU'RE BACKED INTO A
CORNER, YOU TEND TO THROW PEOPLE

35:04.936 --> 35:07.538
UNDER THE BUS THAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE CLOSELY ALIGNED

35:07.538 --> 35:08.206
WITH.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.208
IT REALLY IS NOTHING PERSONAL.

35:10.208 --> 35:12.376
BUT I CAN'T MOVE FORWARD WITH
YOU IN THIS GAME.

35:12.376 --> 35:14.779
>> HI, SARAH BETH.

35:14.779 --> 35:18.916
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAD TO BE OKAY
WITH YOU LEAVING THE HOUSE IN

35:18.916 --> 35:22.420
ORDER TO FURTHER A MISSION
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND CLOSE

35:22.420 --> 35:23.154
TO MY HEART.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.089
GOD BLESS YOU, AND I DO LOVE
YOU.

35:25.089 --> 35:28.359
>> SARAH BETH, I ABSOLUTELY
ALWAYS MEANT IT WHEN I SAID I

35:28.359 --> 35:31.162
WOULD TAKE YOU AS FAR AS I CAN
IN THIS GAME.

35:31.162 --> 35:34.765
UNFORTUNATELY, THE SECRET
ALLIANCE, WHICH I AM A PART OF,

35:34.765 --> 35:36.367
WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO TAKE YOU
ANY FURTHER.

35:36.367 --> 35:39.971
I LOVE YOU AND WANT US TO BE
FRIENDS FOREVER, AND I HOPE THAT

35:39.971 --> 35:41.539
NOTHING IN THIS GAME CHANGES
THAT.

35:41.539 --> 35:45.910
AND I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AND
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

35:45.910 --> 35:49.714
>> Julie: FINAL THOUGHTS TO
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD?

35:49.714 --> 35:52.383
>> YEAH, SO, THAT IS GREAT GAME
PLAY ON THEIR PART.

35:52.383 --> 35:57.989
I HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE
ACTUALLY WAS A SECRET ALLIANCE.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.358
I HAD BEEN JOKING WITH KYLAND
ABOUT IT.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.159
I'M GUESSING AZAH IS ALSO IN IT.

36:02.159 --> 36:03.394
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE.

36:03.394 --> 36:06.030
BUT I'LL BE INTERESTED TO SEE,
YEAH, EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN

36:06.030 --> 36:06.831
THE HOUSE.

36:06.831 --> 36:09.233
BUT I HAVE TOTAL RESPECT FOR
THAT.

36:09.233 --> 36:11.602
>> Julie: IN THE FINAL
SECONDS, DID YOU MAKE A FRIEND

36:11.602 --> 36:12.603
FOR LIFE IN KYLAND?

36:12.603 --> 36:14.839
>> I THINK I MADE QUITE A FEW
FRIENDS FOR LIFE.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.007
>> Julie: OKAY.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.076
WELL, I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS FOR
YOU, SO DON'T GO TOO FAR.

36:19.076 --> 36:20.211
STAY RIGHT THERE.

36:20.211 --> 36:22.580
WHEN WE GET OFF THE AIR, MORE
QUESTIONS COMING YOUR WAY.

36:22.580 --> 36:23.447
>> OKAY.

36:23.447 --> 36:24.582
>> Julie: JURY NUMBER THREE,
SARAH BETH.

36:24.582 --> 36:25.683
>> THANK YOU.

OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION, BUT AS
OUTGOING SECRET H.O.H., SHE IS

37:19.170 --> 37:22.106
NOT ELIGIBLE TO WIN, WHICH MEANS
SHE HAS TO THROW THIS

37:22.106 --> 37:23.307
COMPETITION.

37:23.307 --> 37:28.779
IT ALSO MEANS THIS COMPETITION
IS THE COOKOUT VERSUS ALYSSA.

37:28.779 --> 37:32.516
LET'S HEAD TO THE BACKYARD AND
GET THINGS STARTED.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.685

AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

YOU SPIN, YOU WILL BE REPEATEDLY

38:22.066 --> 38:24.769
SLAMMED INTO BUBBLES, THE GIANT
ELEPHANT.

WELL, YOU'LL ALL FIND OUT SOON

38:29.473 --> 38:30.574

IF YOU FALL OFF AT ANY POINT,
YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY BE

38:34.145 --> 38:36.347
ELIMINATED FROM THIS
COMPETITION.

38:36.347 --> 38:40.718
THE LAST HOUSEGUEST STANDING
WILL BE THE NEW HEAD OF

38:40.718 --> 38:41.952
HOUSEHOLD.

38:41.952 --> 38:46.323
