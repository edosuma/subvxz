00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:06.607 --> 00:07.375
- In the criminal
justice system,

00:08.676 --> 00:10.078
sexually-based offenses

00:10.078 --> 00:11.979
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.481
In New York City,

00:13.481 --> 00:15.316
the dedicated detectives
who investigate

00:15.316 --> 00:17.885
these vicious felonies
are members of an elite squad

00:17.885 --> 00:19.987
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.987 --> 00:21.389
These are their stories.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.225
- Nothing yet?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.594
- They're supposed to post
the link any minute, so...

00:26.594 --> 00:27.861
- Post what?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.363
- Bar results.
Today's the day.

00:29.363 --> 00:32.266
- Okay, shh.
It's up.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.068
All right.
Come on.

00:34.068 --> 00:35.136
Come on.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.871
There it is.
- What?

00:37.871 --> 00:40.174
- My ID number.
It's--it's on the pass list.

00:40.174 --> 00:41.409
- You passed?

00:41.409 --> 00:42.876
- I passed.
Oh, my God!

00:42.876 --> 00:44.445
- Oh!

00:44.445 --> 00:45.846
Congratulations.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.115
- Somebody win the lottery?

00:47.115 --> 00:50.584
- Sort of.
Carisi passed the bar.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.086
- Carisi,
congratulations.

00:52.086 --> 00:53.354
- Thank you.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.788
- Does that mean
you're leaving too?

00:54.788 --> 00:56.023
- What?
No.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.191
- What do you mean, "too"?

00:57.191 --> 01:00.628
- Dodds is going
to Joint Terrorism.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.929
This is his last week.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.597
- Last week?
He just got here.

01:03.597 --> 01:04.832
- Yeah.
He's on his own journey.

01:04.832 --> 01:05.833
- Uh-huh.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.301
- Well, Carisi did it.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.602
We should celebrate.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.838
- Yeah, how about
I take you all to lunch?

01:10.838 --> 01:12.606
- Today I can't.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.974
- Come on, Fin.
Don't be like that.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.809
- No, I got to go meet up
with my son.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.278
He says he has
some news.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.547
Hope he didn't quit his job.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.848
- Hey.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.619
You told 'em?

01:25.619 --> 01:26.887
- I did.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.856
- Task Force?
Really?

01:28.856 --> 01:31.459
SVU, we go after bad guys
and lock 'em up.

01:31.459 --> 01:33.494
Terrorism, you can get
yourself killed.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.497
[dramatic music]

01:36.497 --> 01:44.505
*

01:44.505 --> 01:46.207
- You're leaving?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.008
I thought you were taking
the kids to school.

01:48.008 --> 01:50.411
- I was, but they
want me in early again.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.680
Got a lot of Centre Street
transfers today.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.681
- Can't someone cover?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.048
- We need the OT.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.684
You're the one
who wanted to take the kids

01:56.684 --> 01:58.386
to Disney World, right?

01:58.386 --> 02:00.588
Money makes the world
go around, little man.

02:00.588 --> 02:08.629
*

02:13.201 --> 02:16.670
Hey, Charisse,
my favorite former inmate.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.771
- Come on.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.340
I thought we were done
with this.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.343
- Is that an open container
of alcohol in your hand?

02:22.343 --> 02:24.111
That's a violation.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.446
- Please,
just leave me alone.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.814
Okay?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.317
- How about
I pat you down?

02:29.317 --> 02:32.085
- [sighs]

02:32.085 --> 02:33.421
Please...

02:33.421 --> 02:34.922
we don't need
to do that.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.224
- Get in the car.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.025
*

02:38.025 --> 02:39.793
Now.

02:39.793 --> 02:47.835
*

02:51.138 --> 02:53.341
Oh, Charisse.

02:53.341 --> 02:59.613
*

02:59.613 --> 03:01.249
- This menu's crazy.

03:01.249 --> 03:03.251
- So, Dad,
thanks for meeting me.

03:03.251 --> 03:04.952
- Thanks for having me, man.

03:04.952 --> 03:07.087
I hope you're not trying to fix
me up or anything again, man.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.122
- No, okay, that was a bad idea,

03:09.122 --> 03:10.524
but no.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.260
I actually have some news.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.061
- So what, you're leaving
that halfway house?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.863
- No, I like my job.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.865
I like social work,

03:17.865 --> 03:21.635
and I'm gonna need
the paycheck, because...

03:21.635 --> 03:24.272
Alejandro and I
are starting a family.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.476
- What, you're adopting?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.278
- Well,

03:30.278 --> 03:32.380
we found a surrogate.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.582
She's three months pregnant.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.384
It's a boy.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.386
- So I'm going to be
a grandfather?

03:38.386 --> 03:40.288
- You okay with that?

03:40.288 --> 03:41.889
- I mean, yeah.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.457
Everybody in my squad's
having babies,

03:43.457 --> 03:44.892
showing me pictures.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.060
Now I get to show
some pictures myself.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.829
And this little guy--

03:48.829 --> 03:50.398
hey!

03:50.398 --> 03:52.099
This little guy
calls me Fin.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.501
None of that "grandpa"
stuff, okay?

03:53.501 --> 03:54.968
- Okay.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.170
- That's what's up.
Congratulations.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.639
[cell phone ringing]

03:58.639 --> 04:00.441
- Excuse me a sec.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.043
Hello?

04:03.043 --> 04:04.312
Slow down, Charisse.

04:04.312 --> 04:06.680
Where--where are you?
Are you all right?

04:06.680 --> 04:07.915
- [panting]

04:07.915 --> 04:11.652
That CO from Rikers,
Gary.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.186
He just...

04:13.186 --> 04:15.523
he just raped me.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.157
- Okay.
Where are you?

04:17.157 --> 04:18.158
*

04:18.158 --> 04:20.728
Stay there.
I'll come get you.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.330
- What's going on?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.532
- One of my clients says
her former CO just raped her.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.066
I got to go.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.735
- No, hold on, hold on.
We got to be careful.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.703
A corrections officer?

04:29.703 --> 04:30.938
Let me call Liv.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.774
*

04:33.774 --> 04:36.243
- Until today,
Gary just...

04:36.243 --> 04:38.346
would made me go down on him,

04:38.346 --> 04:41.081
but I said I didn't want
to do that anymore.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.083
I was back
with my boyfriend.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.521
He got mad.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.457
He hit me.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.724
And then he raped me.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.760
- How many times
did this happen?

04:52.760 --> 04:55.396
- I don't keep count.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.466
At least once a week
since I got out.

04:58.466 --> 05:01.369
I'm on his route.

05:01.369 --> 05:04.137
I thought it was bad enough
when I was inside.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.040
- Did he assault you
in Rikers?

05:07.040 --> 05:09.643
- He never hurt me,

05:09.643 --> 05:11.278
but when he'd take me back
from a visit,

05:11.278 --> 05:15.816
he'd make a stop
in the chapel.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.185
- No cameras there.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.454
- He knows
what he's doing.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.822
He'd say,

05:21.822 --> 05:23.491
"You do me a favor,

05:23.491 --> 05:24.725
I do you one".

05:24.725 --> 05:26.193
- Meaning?

05:26.193 --> 05:28.696
- Meaning I get to see
my kids.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.799
Don't get strip-searched,
thrown into solitary.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.201
Don't get my teeth
knocked in.

05:34.201 --> 05:36.570
- Did you report this?

05:36.570 --> 05:38.706
- In Rikers?

05:38.706 --> 05:41.208
The COs and the gangs
run that place.

05:41.208 --> 05:45.078
Every female inmate in there
knows that.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.748
Every time he'd do me,
he'd say,

05:47.748 --> 05:49.883
"Cry all you want,

05:49.883 --> 05:51.685
"but you're just a broke,

05:51.685 --> 05:55.022
"black crack whore.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.924
Who's gonna believe you?"

05:56.924 --> 05:58.258
- I do, Charisse.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.261
- [laughing]
Uh-huh.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.130
Um...

06:03.130 --> 06:05.098
I never should have called Ken.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.901
Um...

06:07.901 --> 06:10.337
I was just messed up.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.005
Don't worry.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.674
I know this doesn't go anywhere.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.677
[somber music]

06:16.677 --> 06:19.012
*

06:19.012 --> 06:22.015
[dramatic music]

07:05.526 --> 07:05.659
.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.528
- Gary Munson.
What do we know about him?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.531
- CO at Rikers for 17 years.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.965
Never charged,
never disciplined.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.502
Puts in for a lot of OT.
A wife, two kids.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.237
- His father-in-law is a deputy
inspector at Queens South.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.239
Now, the second time
Gary fails the police exam,

07:19.239 --> 07:20.741
strings get pulled,
he makes D.O.C.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.375
He's got three complaints
in his jacket.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.611
Nothing stuck.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.547
- Nothing ever sticks
at Rikers.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.316
That CO union has more power
than any place I've ever seen.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.584
Putting that aside,

07:30.584 --> 07:31.819
these cases
are never easy.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.386
Your complainant
has 12 arrests?

07:33.386 --> 07:35.989
- Misdemeanors:
drugs, prostitution.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.925
My son says
she's turning it around.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.226
- This guy covers
his tracks.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.427
There's no DNA,
no witnesses,

07:40.427 --> 07:41.662
vulnerable victims.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.996
- Look, we really
caught a break

07:42.996 --> 07:44.898
when Charisse called Ken.
- Did we?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.667
It's still the word
of a corrections officer

07:46.667 --> 07:48.569
versus a black single mother
with a drug problem

07:48.569 --> 07:50.103
and a prison record.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.905
- All right, if he's raping her
on the street,

07:51.905 --> 07:53.574
how many is he raping
on the inside?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.609
Is there any value
in having DOI look at him?

07:55.609 --> 07:58.679
- Don't--Rikers is where
investigations go to die.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.681
Violence, rape, assaults,

08:00.681 --> 08:01.915
hundreds of allegations,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.551
almost no prosecutions.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.052
- Are you saying
just walk away?

08:05.052 --> 08:07.755
- If a CO is having sex
with an inmate,

08:07.755 --> 08:09.422
forced or not,
that's rape.

08:09.422 --> 08:10.924
- It is, but Rikers--

08:10.924 --> 08:13.594
it's like
"The Lord of the Flies" there.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.395
If anyone finds out
we're investigating him,

08:15.395 --> 08:16.664
Munson gets tipped off,

08:16.664 --> 08:17.898
and his vics pay.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.701
- So we're not
investigating him.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.169
We need the guards' help.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.738
We're investigating
a trafficking ring

08:24.738 --> 08:26.774
with ties to gang members

08:26.774 --> 08:29.276
who were involved
with female inmates.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.745
- All right, yeah.
Put up a good front.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.413
Pick another dozen women
who have rotated

08:33.413 --> 08:34.582
through Charisse's unit

08:34.582 --> 08:35.949
with similar records.
- Okay.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.885
- Charisse says
she was raped in the chapel.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.588
We should pull the surveillance
video from the hallway outside.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.591
- And plus another six cameras.
Hand them a laundry list.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.059
With luck, they won't realize
that Munson's the target.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.130
- I'll start
the paperwork.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.199
- You want to spend
your last week at Rikers?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.635
- I'm not coasting out.
I'll put in my time to the end.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.236
- What, are you trying
to make me miss you

08:56.236 --> 08:57.605
now that you're
already gone?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.506
- I'm just doing my job.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.945
- Sex-trafficking victims?

09:04.945 --> 09:07.047
Seriously, that's what you guys
call these women?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.849
- I know, we're looking
at low-level hookers.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.317
- But a couple of them
were underage.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.820
SVU gets called in,
hence, "trafficking."

09:12.820 --> 09:14.688
- And the crap keeps
rolling down the hill.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.224
[door buzzes]
I hear you.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.360
Visitor logs
for the so-called "victims."

09:20.360 --> 09:22.663
- Least you don't have to
follow up with the boyfriends.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.998
- Audio recordings
of phone calls is no problem.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.968
500 hours of "baby" this,
"baby" that.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.536
But you need video too?

09:29.536 --> 09:30.971
- We want to know
who these girls interact with

09:30.971 --> 09:31.972
after they see
their visitors.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.373
- But there's no audio.

09:33.373 --> 09:34.808
I'm not sure
how much help it'll be.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.409
- If it's on the list,
it's on the list.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.545
We just have
to check that box.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.180
- I'll run it
by my warden.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.883
Between the Feds
and DOI investigating...

09:42.883 --> 09:44.885
Look, it's bad enough
we got these animals in here.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.887
We're being killed
by friendly fire.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.556
- Is there any chance we could
talk to some of these inmates?

09:49.556 --> 09:51.892
- COs will know
where to find them.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.393
- Mo'Nique?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.729
She ain't here.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.330
She is in the infirmary.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.565
They're all working something.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.000
Each one's worse
than the next.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.334
- I'm sure it can get
rough in here.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.535
- [scoffs]

10:02.535 --> 10:04.071
I've been screamed at,
spit on, had

10:04.071 --> 10:07.074
you-don't-even-want-to-know-what
thrown at me.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.678
Guys pull their thing out,
wave it at the female COs.

10:10.678 --> 10:12.512
Anyone making a complaint,
they're lying.

10:12.512 --> 10:13.947
- That's not why we're here.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.116
Some of the inmates
may have ties to the CPB gang.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.718
- We think they
may be facilitating

10:17.718 --> 10:19.787
the pimping of girls
on the outside.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.354
- Sure.

10:21.354 --> 10:24.257
They'd sell their own sisters
for a score.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.726
- Keisha, possession.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.195
Mo'Nique, assault.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.864
Janice, prostitution.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.366
Della, public urination.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.367
A bunch of real ladies.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.103
- Lot of rough road.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.271
- We're just trying to keep 'em
from killing each other.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.873
Now, if you're telling me
that they have

10:39.873 --> 10:42.876
baby daddies or exes
or brothers in CPB,

10:42.876 --> 10:44.144
I wouldn't be surprised.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.913
- You're on visitation detail.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.215
Any inmates, current or former,
that let something slip

10:48.215 --> 10:50.583
about the gangs running girls
in the South Bronx?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.720
- Well, anything real,
I go straight to the warden.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.154
I don't look
the other way.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.323
- Any of these ladies
ever asked you to?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.324
- What, are you kidding me?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.226
They're working me 24/7.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.294
With the big eyes
and the crying

11:01.294 --> 11:02.863
and the begging.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.131
'Cause everybody in here,

11:04.131 --> 11:06.166
they're all innocent,
right?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.467
- Of course they are.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.002
Thanks.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.738
- Mike Dodds.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.405
Chief Dodds is your dad,
right?

11:12.405 --> 11:14.174
- Yeah.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.009
- My father-in-law knows him.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.845
- Sure.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.880
Thanks.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.651
[tense music]

11:24.651 --> 11:30.758
*

11:30.758 --> 11:32.492
- The female CO
was the lookout.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.061
- Yep, and just like
Charisse said,

11:34.061 --> 11:35.562
he takes her to the chapel
after visiting hours.

11:35.562 --> 11:37.197
- After five minutes, he emerges

11:37.197 --> 11:39.599
with a big grin on his face,
adjusting his junk.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.601
Seconds later,
she comes out.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.170
We know what happened.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.572
- So, this corresponds
with the dates Charisse gave us?

11:45.572 --> 11:47.374
- Yeah, every Saturday,
her mother shows up

11:47.374 --> 11:49.442
with her daughters,
and every Saturday afternoon,

11:49.442 --> 11:50.844
Munson gets his favors.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.579
- Ten times, same M.O.,
over three months.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.047
- And it's not just Charisse.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.783
By chance, we found
three other probable victims.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.250
- Well, that's not a surprise.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.019
- They're all black women,
20s to 30s.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.287
He's--he's got a type.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.089
I'm tracking down their records.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.590
- We've got months
of these tapes to go through.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.825
We'll find some more vics.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.259
- Well, you can, but Rikers

12:06.259 --> 12:07.928
is out of our jurisdiction.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.462
Charisse was assaulted
in Manhattan,

12:09.462 --> 12:10.931
so I'll call Barba
and let him know

12:10.931 --> 12:12.599
that we have evidence
backing her story.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.834
- And we let Charisse know?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.102
- It's gonna be tough.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.503
Ken just got a call.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.671
Charisse was arrested tonight.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.674
[dramatic music]

12:21.674 --> 12:27.848
*

12:27.848 --> 12:29.682
- Charisse.

12:29.682 --> 12:32.519
What did you do?

12:32.519 --> 12:34.822
Just can't get enough
of me, can you, girl?

12:36.489 --> 12:39.159
I will see you tomorrow.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.001
.

12:49.102 --> 12:49.669
- Charisse McCabe?
Yeah.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.040
I saw her after roll call
this morning.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.741
They should put a revolving door
in for that girl.

12:54.741 --> 12:56.476
- Yeah, we heard she just
got picked up last night.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.845
- Oh, you heard that?

12:57.845 --> 12:59.079
- Yeah, the gang unit
looped us in.

12:59.079 --> 13:00.380
She was arrested
with her boyfriend.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.882
He was a crew chief
for the CPB.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.183
- Oh, could be.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.551
I don't know
what the charges were,

13:04.551 --> 13:06.619
but I heard that her
and her boyfriend

13:06.619 --> 13:08.555
were this trick-rolling team.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.857
- Oh, that checks out.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.859
Then we have
an outstanding case.

13:11.859 --> 13:12.860
John wakes up
in a hotel,

13:12.860 --> 13:14.027
no Rolex, no laptop.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.695
Craigslist hookup,
you know?

13:15.695 --> 13:17.397
All he can remember is
that she was pretty and black.

13:17.397 --> 13:18.866
- Is that right?

13:18.866 --> 13:21.501
Well, it fits Charisse
and her M.O., so--

13:21.501 --> 13:22.970
- We think that now
she's back inside,

13:22.970 --> 13:24.404
it might give us
some leverage on her.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.339
- Yeah, I wouldn't count on it.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.740
Every time that one
opens her mouth,

13:27.740 --> 13:29.009
a lie comes out.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.243
- No, we got
the john waiting.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.244
We put her in a lineup,

13:31.244 --> 13:32.245
get this thing closed out.

13:32.245 --> 13:33.380
She gets ID'd.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.916
She might lead us
to other names.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.684
- They give you OT
for that?

13:37.684 --> 13:39.086
- Collars for dollars.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.321
- Good for you.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.756
But it's a dead end.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.526
- He did this.
Gary.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.196
He said that he could do
whatever he wanted to me.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.498
That the only time
I should open my mouth

13:51.498 --> 13:52.900
is with him
in the chapel.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.335
- So he assaulted you again?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.904
- What do you think?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.907
I told you, this is never
gonna go away.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.741
- We can keep you
out of Rikers.

14:01.741 --> 14:02.976
- No, it doesn't matter.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.244
He knows where I live,

14:04.244 --> 14:07.747
where my mama lives
with my two girls.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.749
I wasn't resisting arrest
or being disorderly

14:09.749 --> 14:11.584
or whatever they say.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.254
- Did they identify themselves,
tell you why they stopped you?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.255
- They just said,

14:15.255 --> 14:17.925
"NYPD, empty your pockets now."

14:17.925 --> 14:19.659
He had one joint.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.128
They start yelling,
roughing him up.

14:21.128 --> 14:25.298
I pull my cell,
start to record.

14:25.298 --> 14:29.669
Three cops come out of nowhere,

14:29.669 --> 14:31.438
grab my phone,

14:31.438 --> 14:33.506
and put me in cuffs.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.642
- Did they tell you
why you were under arrest?

14:35.642 --> 14:37.177
- No.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.346
They threw me in the car

14:39.346 --> 14:41.114
and tossed my cell phone
out the window.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.615
- Okay.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.151
Okay, we're gonna look
for that phone.

14:44.151 --> 14:46.786
That video might help us.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.021
- Right.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.790
[dramatic music]

14:50.790 --> 14:54.227
He has complete control of me.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.696
My life is over.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.132
He owns my ass.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.434
- Charisse, we're gonna
protect you.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.603
He's not gonna
get away with this.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.773
- So a possible
illegal search.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.375
- Probable.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.377
We're checking security cams
near the arrest.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.811
- What about
the arresting officers?

15:11.811 --> 15:13.146
- It's a big surprise.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.781
They're not returning our calls,

15:14.781 --> 15:16.716
so we're pulling the 61
and the arrest report.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.151
- Hey.
Lucky break.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.619
Security cam footage
from the bodega

15:19.619 --> 15:22.155
on the corner
caught the whole thing.

15:30.297 --> 15:31.598
See?
They move right in.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.000
Nothing indicates
probable cause.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.901
Am I right?
- It doesn't look good.

15:34.901 --> 15:36.736
- Now, when Charisse starts
filming, they go up to her.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.105
- They call that
resisting arrest,

15:38.105 --> 15:39.606
and they didn't even give her
a chance to resist.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.607
- They're not worried
that they're directly in view

15:40.607 --> 15:41.874
of a security camera?

15:41.874 --> 15:43.310
- What worries me is
this can't be coincidence.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.611
She and her boyfriend
were targeted

15:44.611 --> 15:45.912
as soon as she started
cooperating.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.014
Munson's trying
to intimidate her.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.481
- Yeah, maybe.
Maybe.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017
Find out if there's
any connection between these

15:50.017 --> 15:52.119
five officers and Munson.
- Or his father-in-law.

15:52.119 --> 15:55.422
- So the surveillance video
backs up Charisse's story.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.824
Man, these guys are bold.
- And they're MIA.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.759
I put a call in to
their captain: radio silence.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.428
- Clearly there's no cause
to arrest her.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.762
I'd feel better if her boyfriend
wasn't holding.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.164
What do we know
about him?

16:04.164 --> 16:05.732
- Jay Raymond.
He's got a record.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.800
All for misdemeanor
possession, no ties to CPB.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.269
He pleaded not guilty
last night.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.038
- Which means he's in Rikers,
and he's not safe there,

16:11.038 --> 16:12.039
and neither is Charisse.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.906
- Can you get
the charges dropped, Barba?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.475
- That's a bad move.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.909
I don't want anybody thinking
that we're looking out for her.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.745
Did she make bail?
- Five grand, no bond.

16:18.745 --> 16:22.049
Which might as well
have been 500 grand.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.883
- I can get the judge
to reduce that.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.585
Her defense attorney
will go along with it.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.687
- Hold on.
What about these three?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.789
Right,
they're in Rikers too.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.891
If Munson thinks
that we're investigating him,

16:31.891 --> 16:33.260
they're gonna be
in trouble.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.961
- What are they in for?
- LaTanya Franks.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.563
CeCe Thornhill, Zahara Letts.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.198
They're all in
for class A misdemeanors.

16:38.198 --> 16:39.932
- Do not talk to them
at Rikers.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.701
I'll let their defense attorneys
know that I'll be asking

16:41.701 --> 16:43.803
the judge to reduce
their bail as well.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.712
- People request
a reduction in bail?

16:52.712 --> 16:54.481
- Actually,
we request R.O.R.

16:54.481 --> 16:57.884
- You are aware this is
Ms. McCabe's 13th arrest?

16:57.884 --> 16:59.086
Unlucky 13?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.453
- There was
no probable cause.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.822
My client was a clear victim
of police brutality.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.191
- Your Honor, approach.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.726
- Please do.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.096
- Charisse McCabe
is a material witness

17:09.096 --> 17:12.399
in an ongoing sex-trafficking
case against CPB.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.900
- All right,
Mr. Barba.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.235
- Thank you,
Your Honor.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.104
- LaTanya Franks,
you are released

17:17.104 --> 17:19.106
on your own recognizance,
pending trial.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.141
- I thought the charges
was gonna be dropped.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.676
- Mm-mm, I need you to be here
on the date of your trial.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.977
Will you be able
to do that?

17:24.977 --> 17:26.579
- Yes.
I will.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.315
I understand, Your Honor.
Thank you.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.016
- Thank Mr. Barba.

17:30.016 --> 17:31.351
- Can I ask
what the case is?

17:31.351 --> 17:33.886
- I'm not at liberty
to discuss.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.156
- I understand.
We'll cooperate.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.190
- What does that mean?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.925
- Don't leave town.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.393
Don't get arrested again.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.129
Talk to the detectives.

17:42.129 --> 17:46.133
*

17:46.133 --> 17:47.500
- That's what
this was about?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.269
I'm not testifying
against Munson.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.138
- You just told me
he raped you.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.905
- Cost of doing business
in Rikers.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.541
- That doesn't have
to include rape.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.209
- Really, Elsa?

17:56.209 --> 17:59.712
When's the last time
your white ass got locked up?

17:59.712 --> 18:02.149
- Munson should be
behind bars.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.484
- We can't do that
if you don't testify.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.019
- Go against a CO,
I'm a dead woman walking.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.621
- We can protect you.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.790
- Not in Rikers.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.592
- In Rikers, out of Rikers,

18:12.592 --> 18:15.162
he does whatever he wants
wherever he wants.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.696
- So help us stop him.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.198
- I don't want
to get hurt.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.299
- Listen to me.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.667
If we put him away,

18:20.667 --> 18:21.868
you won't be.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.603
- You think he's the only one?

18:23.603 --> 18:25.638
I have friends on the inside.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.175
His friends will go after them.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.343
It never ends.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.611
- Pulling all these girls
out of Rikers

18:31.611 --> 18:33.446
was a morning well spent.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.981
- We couldn't just leave them
in there, Barba.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.048
- I can't keep them
out forever.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.184
- But we still have Charisse.

18:37.184 --> 18:39.952
- No, we don't.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.654
Ken thinks she's AWOL.

18:41.654 --> 18:46.726
*

18:46.726 --> 18:48.228
- Hey.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.330
Give me a hug, give me a hug,
give me a hug.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.964
Hey, now, I love you,
Chris.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.566
You're gonna be good
for Grandma.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.867
- Charisse.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.306
- Okay.
Go to Grandma.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.841
Go, go ahead.
Go.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.644
What are you all
doing here?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.879
- You leave town now,
you're running out on your bail.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.080
- I've just got to
get out of here.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.081
- Then you're gonna lose
your kids forever.

19:09.081 --> 19:10.617
- They'd be better off.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.619
- Hold on, Charisse.
Can we talk to you for a second?

19:12.619 --> 19:13.920
- Oh, like I have
a choice.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.322
It's over.

19:15.322 --> 19:18.391
- Running away
doesn't make it over.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.459
There are still charges
against you.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.927
- They're lies.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.996
- Yeah, you leave,
you make 'em stick.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.565
- What do you want
from me?

19:25.565 --> 19:27.600
- Your daughters look
like they're good girls.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.503
- They are.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.805
- I know that it seems like
I'm just someone else

19:32.805 --> 19:35.074
coming into your life
to take control.

19:35.074 --> 19:36.976
- No, I don't care about you.

19:36.976 --> 19:38.578
I don't care about me.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.580
I don't care
about any of this.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.451
- But you do care
about your daughters.

19:44.451 --> 19:47.287
- You keep saying
that your life is over,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.522
that Munson owns you.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.758
I don't want that
to be true for you, Charisse.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.327
[somber music]

19:54.327 --> 19:56.162
Do you want those
two little girls

19:56.162 --> 19:59.299
growing up to think
there's no chance?

19:59.299 --> 20:02.935
Or do you want them growing up
and seeing their mother fight?

20:02.935 --> 20:10.977
*

20:21.588 --> 20:23.990
- [laughs softly]

20:23.990 --> 20:25.325
Gary.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.059
- Hey, skank.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.828
Who the hell do you think
you are, calling me?

20:28.828 --> 20:31.063
- Hey, don't be like that.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.066
I thought maybe we could
do each other a favor, huh?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.902
*

20:35.902 --> 20:38.371
You want to go
for a ride?

20:38.371 --> 20:40.540
- No, you know,
actually, I...

20:40.540 --> 20:42.041
I thought we'd walk.

20:42.041 --> 20:43.643
You got a problem
with that?

20:43.643 --> 20:44.877
- Whatever you want.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.813
- Okay, then move that ass.

20:52.352 --> 20:52.485
.

20:53.553 --> 20:54.321
- Where are we going?
- To the river.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.357
What do you care, anyway?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.926
Arrested one day,
back on the street the next.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.328
That golden ass of yours

21:01.328 --> 21:02.895
is like
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.664
- It wasn't like that.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.766
The judge R.O.R'd me the second
he heard the charges.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.000
- Oh, so you didn't rat out
your boyfriend

21:08.000 --> 21:09.001
just so you could get out?

21:09.001 --> 21:10.337
I know things.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.605
I know he's still
locked up.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.341
- Oh, that's why
I called you.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.776
I thought--
I thought, you know, maybe...

21:16.776 --> 21:18.811
I could do you
a favor,

21:18.811 --> 21:20.079
you could help him out?

21:20.079 --> 21:22.749
- Thought of that
all by yourself?

21:22.749 --> 21:25.117
What are you gonna do
for me, huh?

21:25.117 --> 21:27.620
- He could be on to her.
Maybe this was a mistake.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.855
- Look, it's our best shot.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.425
He may just be getting off
on the hunt.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.427
Fin, you have her in sight?

21:34.427 --> 21:36.095
- That's cool.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.930
The safe word is "home."
She knows it.

21:37.930 --> 21:40.933
[tense music]

21:40.933 --> 21:42.535
- Why don't we go back
to the car, huh?

21:42.535 --> 21:45.472
- What's the matter?
You don't trust me?

21:45.472 --> 21:46.706
After you.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.776
*

21:49.776 --> 21:51.010
Get in there.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.613
*

21:53.613 --> 21:54.847
Let's go.
Go.

21:54.847 --> 21:57.717
*

21:57.717 --> 21:59.719
- We don't need
to be here.

21:59.719 --> 22:02.455
*

22:02.455 --> 22:04.857
- Why don't you tell me
what you want to talk about?

22:04.857 --> 22:08.127
- [gasping]

22:08.127 --> 22:09.962
- Cat got your tongue?

22:09.962 --> 22:11.864
- They went in through
the downstairs entrance.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.533
I got no video.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.267
- All right, we do,
but it's just a brick wall.

22:15.267 --> 22:17.236
We still have audio.
- You know, Charisse?

22:17.236 --> 22:19.539
I tried to look out for you
on the inside.

22:19.539 --> 22:23.410
I tried to be
your friend.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.111
I'm a married man.

22:25.111 --> 22:26.479
- He knows she's wired.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.280
Fin, we're en route.
Be ready.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.782
- You know,
you can't be calling me

22:29.782 --> 22:32.218
and asking me to help
with your boyfriend

22:32.218 --> 22:35.121
or your legal problems,

22:35.121 --> 22:37.223
because--well...

22:37.223 --> 22:39.592
you got to learn to stick up
for yourself, Charisse,

22:39.592 --> 22:41.293
and stand on your own
two feet.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.129
- Gary?
- No, now, now, now.

22:43.129 --> 22:45.765
Don't--don't be begging me.
Don't.

22:45.765 --> 22:48.067
Don't try that.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.803
Don't give me
those pillow lips.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.071
- Please.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.140
Please,
let me go home.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.442
- Fin, go now!

22:55.442 --> 22:56.643
- Copy.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.746
*

22:59.746 --> 23:01.080
[tires screeching]

23:01.080 --> 23:03.315
*

23:03.315 --> 23:05.351
NYPD.
Freeze!

23:05.351 --> 23:06.586
- Hands up!
Now!

23:06.586 --> 23:07.854
- It's okay.
I'm on the job.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.889
- Not on my job.
Turn around.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.223
- Do you mind telling me
what's going on?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.859
- Shut up.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.326
What the hell is this?

23:14.326 --> 23:15.695
- I'm a CO.
I'm allowed to carry.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.263
- You threaten her
with that, Munson?

23:17.263 --> 23:19.231
- Yes, he had a gun on me.
He tried to rape me.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.900
- You're under arrest
for attempted rape.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.602
- Of this whore?
Arrest her.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.103
Trying to bribe
an officer.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.705
I only went along
to see how far she'd go.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.706
- I told you to shut up.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.107
- Hey, Charisse.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.742
So you got a lieutenant
to show up for you?

23:29.742 --> 23:30.943
- Hey.
Stop talking.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.278
Get him out of here now,
Sergeant.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.013
- Ah, you know
how to work it, girl.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.215
I'll give you that.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.517
- You're okay.
- [crying]

23:37.517 --> 23:38.618
- You're okay.

23:38.618 --> 23:40.487
*

23:40.487 --> 23:43.490
- Wow, you got a lady boss
bitching you up.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.491
You like a woman on top?

23:44.491 --> 23:45.892
- You get one phone call.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.127
Is it gonna be your wife
or your father-in-law?

23:48.127 --> 23:51.063
*

23:51.063 --> 23:52.499
- First of all,
I'd like to make it clear

23:52.499 --> 23:54.601
my client doesn't have
to be here.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.803
- As his union rep,
it's against my advice.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.137
- You don't want to be here?

23:58.137 --> 23:59.572
That's fine, we can put him
in the holding cell

23:59.572 --> 24:02.008
right now in the Tombs.
- No, you won't.

24:02.008 --> 24:03.710
There are courtesies
on both sides.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.344
- So, courteously...

24:05.344 --> 24:07.346
what was your business
with Charisse McCabe?

24:07.346 --> 24:08.681
- Look,
Charisse came on to me.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.149
She was worried
about her boyfriend,

24:10.149 --> 24:12.519
and she wanted to trade
sex for a favor,

24:12.519 --> 24:14.120
and I said "No."

24:14.120 --> 24:15.655
- And you had to pull her
into an abandoned building

24:15.655 --> 24:16.656
to communicate that?

24:16.656 --> 24:17.857
- She was wearing a wire, right?

24:17.857 --> 24:19.058
Why don't you listen to that?

24:19.058 --> 24:20.392
You'll know I did
the right thing.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.828
- The only thing that proves
is that you knew

24:21.828 --> 24:23.362
that she was wired.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.364
Charisse told us
that while you were saying

24:25.364 --> 24:26.733
all the right things,

24:26.733 --> 24:28.334
you were trying
to rape her

24:28.334 --> 24:30.002
at gunpoint.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.071
- She's just looking
for a lawsuit against the city.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.673
- We see it time and again
at Rikers.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.207
My client was trying
to give this woman

24:35.207 --> 24:36.743
the benefit of the doubt.

24:36.743 --> 24:38.377
- No, I'm looking at
attempted rape here.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.246
- So what are we
talking about, huh?

24:40.246 --> 24:41.648
You want him
out of D.O.C.?

24:41.648 --> 24:42.815
He might be willing
to resign

24:42.815 --> 24:43.983
if he keeps his pension

24:43.983 --> 24:45.251
and full benefits.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.352
- Seriously?

24:46.352 --> 24:47.887
Mr. Munson,

24:47.887 --> 24:50.757
you are facing
two counts in Manhattan

24:50.757 --> 24:52.825
of rape
and attempted rape.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.895
- Not to mention
multiple assault charges

24:55.895 --> 24:57.429
for female inmates
at Rikers Island.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.665
- Rikers?

24:58.665 --> 25:00.767
That's outside
your jurisdiction.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.735
- If you want to save
your family and your union

25:02.735 --> 25:05.304
the public humiliation of these
charges, this is your chance.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.439
You plead guilty to one count
of attempted rape,

25:07.439 --> 25:09.475
and we won't go after you
for these Rikers assaults.

25:09.475 --> 25:10.910
- So this is just
a shakedown?

25:10.910 --> 25:12.144
- One count?

25:12.144 --> 25:13.580
Gary,

25:13.580 --> 25:15.481
he just admitted
he doesn't have a case.

25:15.481 --> 25:16.749
If he did,

25:16.749 --> 25:18.417
he would have not
offered that.

25:18.417 --> 25:22.121
- You know what they call
my brother COs?

25:22.121 --> 25:24.423
New York's boldest.

25:24.423 --> 25:26.793
Other DAs have learned
to think long and hard

25:26.793 --> 25:29.596
before seeking
unprovable indictments

25:29.596 --> 25:31.497
against my rank and file.

25:37.604 --> 25:39.606
- Gary Munson,
on one count of rape

25:39.606 --> 25:42.108
in the first degree
and one count of attempted rape

25:42.108 --> 25:44.677
in the second degree,
how do you plead?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.478
- Not guilty on both,
Your Honor.

25:46.478 --> 25:47.980
- People on bail?

25:47.980 --> 25:49.816
- Remand.

25:49.816 --> 25:52.151
I know that being a CO is one
of the toughest jobs there is,

25:52.151 --> 25:54.821
and most of them carry out their
duties with dignity and respect.

25:54.821 --> 25:56.222
That's why it's essential
to send the message

25:56.222 --> 25:57.890
that New York City
will not tolerate

25:57.890 --> 25:59.158
any abuses of power.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.627
- Mr. Barba,
this is not the time

26:00.627 --> 26:02.094
to score political points.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.630
- That being said,
Gary Munson is not

26:03.630 --> 26:05.464
one of the good guys.
He is a serial predator

26:05.464 --> 26:08.100
who abuses his position
to assault female inmates.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.769
He has access
to DOC databases,

26:09.769 --> 26:11.370
including home addresses.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.640
- Mr. Munson is a dedicated
civil servant,

26:13.640 --> 26:16.108
17 years CO,
no record,

26:16.108 --> 26:18.077
who himself
is being victimized

26:18.077 --> 26:20.647
by career criminals
with an axe to grind.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.650
We request that
all charges be dropped.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.918
- This is neither the time
nor the place, Mr. Pastrino.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.887
These are serious allegations.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.789
However,
given the record

26:29.789 --> 26:32.224
of the defendant
and his ties to the community,

26:32.224 --> 26:35.094
I am denying the people's
request for remand.

26:35.094 --> 26:38.164
Bail is set at $200,000,
cash or bond.

26:39.565 --> 26:41.934
- I don't think
we have that kind of money.

26:41.934 --> 26:43.569
- We look out
for our own, Lisa.

26:43.569 --> 26:47.674
*

26:47.674 --> 26:49.909
- You set him up.
This is entrapment.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.578
- That's not what's
happening here, Mrs. Munson.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.681
- My husband is a good man,
a good father.

26:54.681 --> 26:57.083
Calling him a rapist?

26:57.083 --> 26:58.350
How dare you?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.352
*

27:00.352 --> 27:02.521
How dare all of you?

27:02.521 --> 27:06.225
*

27:10.797 --> 27:10.930
.

27:11.964 --> 27:12.999
- Okay, Charisse--not the
world's most credible witness.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.402
Audio and video are subject
to different interpretations.

27:16.402 --> 27:17.536
Did you get anything
from his car?

27:17.536 --> 27:18.604
- No, it was hygienic.

27:18.604 --> 27:20.206
He had it detailed
the night before.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.041
- Yeah, probably why he didn't
want her to get in yesterday.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.342
- What about his cell phone,
GPS, his E-ZPass?

27:23.342 --> 27:25.044
Can we put him near
her halfway house?

27:25.044 --> 27:26.578
- He's smarter than he looks:
he turns off his GPS

27:26.578 --> 27:28.881
to and from work,
and he pays cash at tolls.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.616
- So nothing puts him
in Charisse's neighborhood?

27:30.616 --> 27:32.451
- No, we may have something.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.220
Now, the red lines
are Gary's possible route

27:34.220 --> 27:35.722
to work from his home.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.289
Now, he should use
either the Triborough

27:37.289 --> 27:39.826
or the Whitestone Bridge
to get from the Bronx to Queens.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.060
- But he doesn't?
- No.

27:41.060 --> 27:42.228
We've got him
on bridge cams once a week,

27:42.228 --> 27:43.930
on Fridays, using
the Macombs Dam Bridge

27:43.930 --> 27:45.097
to cross into Manhattan.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.899
- Okay, nothing
on the street cams?

27:46.899 --> 27:48.600
- No, like I said,
he's smart.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.737
No, he avoids
known traffic cams.

27:50.737 --> 27:52.071
- Key word: "known."

27:52.071 --> 27:53.740
I called my new friends
at Joint Terrorism

27:53.740 --> 27:55.141
and caught a break.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.143
Charisse's halfway house
is two blocks away

27:57.143 --> 27:58.544
from a Harlem Mosque.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.747
- Terrorism, Harlem,
mosque.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.982
NYPD doesn't like
those three words together.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.616
- License plate readers.

28:04.616 --> 28:05.818
They've had 'em
near hot spots since 2007.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.119
- That's right.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.955
Now, we found
that every Friday morning

28:08.955 --> 28:10.489
for five Fridays running,

28:10.489 --> 28:12.124
Gary Munson has driven
within two blocks

28:12.124 --> 28:13.760
of the Mosque
and within 100 yards

28:13.760 --> 28:15.394
of where Charisse said
she was raped.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.663
- That's not a route.
That's a pretzel.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.298
- There's not a reason
on earth

28:19.298 --> 28:21.033
to detour through Manhattan
from the Bronx

28:21.033 --> 28:22.769
to get to Rikers.
- Good.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.771
It's circumstantial,
but it's a start.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.038
Keep digging.

28:26.038 --> 28:28.040
- Okay, here's where
you might be able to help us.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.810
Now, Munson used a condom
with Charisse last week,

28:30.810 --> 28:32.845
but there weren't any
in his car, so...

28:32.845 --> 28:34.480
maybe he uses
the same brand at home.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.982
- That might be enough
to get me a warrant.

28:35.982 --> 28:37.416
I'll see if I can find
a judge who's willing

28:37.416 --> 28:39.251
to go against the CO union.

28:42.188 --> 28:43.655
- You're not
gonna find anything.

28:43.655 --> 28:45.858
- Thank you for
your cooperation, Mr. Munson.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.094
- Yeah, your daddy
gonna be proud of you?

28:48.094 --> 28:49.929
Invading the home
of a fellow officer,

28:49.929 --> 28:51.898
railroading
one of your own?

28:51.898 --> 28:54.433
- We're looking for anything
with the victim's DNA on it.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.368
The suspect's clothing,
personal items.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.905
- On it, Sergeant.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.607
- Again, is there a place,
maybe a neighbor's house,

29:01.607 --> 29:03.075
that you can take
your children to?

29:03.075 --> 29:04.476
- Now you're worried
about us?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.145
- Ah...

29:06.145 --> 29:08.147
The search is gonna be
extremely disruptive.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.983
Your kids
shouldn't be here.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.820
Please, Mrs. Munson.

29:13.820 --> 29:16.522
- Annie, Tommy,
let's go play in the backyard.

29:16.522 --> 29:18.024
- Do we have to?

29:18.024 --> 29:21.160
- You can use the hose.
Make mud pies.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.561
- Race you.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.365
- We wouldn't be here
is we didn't have good reason.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.167
- He didn't do this,
and I'm calling my father.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.302
He's a deputy inspector,
and when he hears about this,

29:30.302 --> 29:31.838
you are all gonna be
on traffic detail.

29:31.838 --> 29:34.440
- I understand
that you're angry,

29:34.440 --> 29:38.945
but what I'm about to say
is gonna make you more angry.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.713
You should get yourself
tested for STDs

29:41.713 --> 29:42.982
and for HIV.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.884
[dramatic music]

29:44.884 --> 29:47.286
Your husband is a...

29:47.286 --> 29:48.855
reckless man.

29:48.855 --> 29:53.059
*

29:53.059 --> 29:56.028
- You can go to hell.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.030
- Just get tested.

29:58.030 --> 30:02.368
*

30:02.368 --> 30:04.570
- Could you put the things back
where you found them?

30:04.570 --> 30:07.206
What, are you
tearing up my home?

30:07.206 --> 30:09.208
Harassing me?
- We're just doing our job.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.010
- Yeah, are you?
Listen to me.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.744
I didn't rape anybody.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.046
I'm either on the road

30:14.046 --> 30:15.647
or on my shift
at Rikers.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.150
Just ask my supervisors
or my union.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.920
Check my time cards.
Everybody will vouch for me.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.989
- Yeah,
I bet they will.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.390
- You know what,
if you need me,

30:24.390 --> 30:25.992
I'm gonna be
with my family.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.995
*

30:28.995 --> 30:29.996
- He's right.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.263
You throw a rock at Rikers,

30:31.263 --> 30:32.764
you hit a CO
with mixed integrity.

30:32.764 --> 30:34.066
They're punching
each other's time cards,

30:34.066 --> 30:35.067
covering for each other.

30:35.067 --> 30:37.369
- Well, punching time cards

30:37.369 --> 30:39.438
for somebody else is one thing.

30:39.438 --> 30:41.440
It's another
to facilitate rapes.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.076
*

30:44.076 --> 30:45.777
That's you, right, Orita?

30:45.777 --> 30:47.413
You're standing
outside the chapel,

30:47.413 --> 30:49.615
while Munson
takes that girl inside.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.050
- What happened inside
that chapel?

30:51.050 --> 30:53.419
- I don't know
what he does in there.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.021
- There's no evidence
of wrongdoing.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.622
She's manning her post.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.357
- Well, what do we think
he's doing with the inmates?

30:58.357 --> 31:00.126
Ministering
to their spiritual needs?

31:00.126 --> 31:01.928
- You've asked
about the video.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.463
You've asked
about the time cards.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.033
Now you're fishing.
- Are we?

31:07.033 --> 31:09.035
So, Orita,

31:09.035 --> 31:12.171
if we go over these time cards
for the past three years,

31:12.171 --> 31:15.007
every single one,

31:15.007 --> 31:19.811
are you saying that
we won't find any violations?

31:19.811 --> 31:21.547
- Look, no offense
to my union rep,

31:21.547 --> 31:23.015
but I believe this would be
a good time

31:23.015 --> 31:24.716
for me to call my lawyer.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.286
- Seems like it.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.955
Your cell phone's
not gonna work in here,

31:28.955 --> 31:31.557
so why don't I walk you out
to a hot spot?

31:35.461 --> 31:36.695
- My lawyer's on his way.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.630
- Listen, that's your right,

31:38.630 --> 31:40.299
but you should know
that once he gets here,

31:40.299 --> 31:41.300
I can't help you.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.668
- What do you want, lady?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.570
- What I don't want to do
is go after you

31:44.570 --> 31:46.072
for time card violations.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.806
- Everybody cheats on OT.

31:47.806 --> 31:49.976
It's allowed.
- Yeah?

31:49.976 --> 31:51.710
Until it gives us leverage.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.513
- So I say again,
what do you want?

31:54.513 --> 31:56.848
- You know that
Munson is a rapist.

31:56.848 --> 31:58.417
- Do I?
- Yeah, you do.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.987
'Cause you're his lookout.

32:00.987 --> 32:03.122
See, I know
how it works in there.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.723
You do him favors,

32:04.723 --> 32:07.559
he gets his guys
to look after you,

32:07.559 --> 32:08.995
no double shifts
on holidays,

32:08.995 --> 32:10.429
overtime when you need it.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.164
- If you know so much,
why do you need me?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.066
- Orita, you better
start listening to me,

32:14.066 --> 32:18.304
'cause I'm trying
to help you out.

32:18.304 --> 32:21.640
Maybe we don't get you
on facilitation of rape,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.609
but those time cards,

32:23.609 --> 32:25.477
theft of service, fraud.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.613
*

32:27.613 --> 32:29.015
Who's gonna look after
your kids

32:29.015 --> 32:31.317
when you're in jail
with all your friends?

32:31.317 --> 32:36.322
*

32:36.322 --> 32:38.690
- So...

32:38.690 --> 32:40.659
I leave early
on Sundays.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.128
- Uh-huh.

32:42.128 --> 32:44.496
- I have a sick mother,

32:44.496 --> 32:46.032
and so does Munson.

32:46.032 --> 32:48.167
- Munson has
a sick mother too?

32:48.167 --> 32:50.036
- No, he leaves...

32:50.036 --> 32:52.038
early every Sunday.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.539
6:00 p.m.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.541
Time card out at midnight.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.944
*

32:58.944 --> 33:01.180
- I'm gonna need
more than that.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.950
*

33:04.950 --> 33:07.219
- One of his frequent flyers,

33:07.219 --> 33:09.055
Della Carter,

33:09.055 --> 33:11.290
she's in for something
every few months.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.459
She's, like, 40.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.395
She got a baby sister
on the outside.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.630
Munson saw her visiting.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.732
Munson wanted her.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.234
Munson got her.

33:22.234 --> 33:30.276
*

33:33.145 --> 33:34.380
- Cops?

33:34.380 --> 33:37.283
- Yeah, son.
- Your mama home?

33:37.283 --> 33:38.584
- Leanne Carter?

33:38.584 --> 33:39.818
- Yeah?

33:39.818 --> 33:42.321
- Your sister, Della,
at Rikers?

33:42.321 --> 33:43.389
- Oh, God, is she dead?

33:43.389 --> 33:44.890
- No.

33:44.890 --> 33:47.126
- But we need to ask you
some questions

33:47.126 --> 33:49.761
about a CO of hers,
Gary Munson?

33:49.761 --> 33:52.231
*

33:52.231 --> 33:54.100
- Go inside.

33:54.100 --> 33:55.601
- I'm not leaving you.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.769
- Xbox,
all you want.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.004
Go.

33:59.004 --> 34:05.677
*

34:05.677 --> 34:07.879
What do you want to know?

34:07.879 --> 34:09.215
- He been around lately?

34:09.215 --> 34:10.916
*

34:10.916 --> 34:12.718
- Yeah.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.386
That son of a bitch
been around.

34:22.228 --> 34:22.361
.

34:23.229 --> 34:24.263
- Gary Munson came to
my apartment every Sunday night.

34:26.132 --> 34:27.833
He knew my son was asleep
in the next room.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.602
He'd lock the door and force me
to have sex with him.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.971
- Did you ever report it?
- No.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.507
My big sister, Della--
she's doing a nine-month bid

34:35.507 --> 34:36.775
in Rikers.
- Mm-hmm.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.944
- Munson met me
when I was visiting.

34:38.944 --> 34:40.512
He said if I did him
a favor,

34:40.512 --> 34:42.248
he'd make sure
Della stayed out of trouble.

34:42.248 --> 34:44.616
- What did you and Della
take that to mean?

34:44.616 --> 34:46.818
- If I went along
with what Munson wanted,

34:46.818 --> 34:50.289
Della wouldn't get
stripped searched, binged.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.590
- Binged?

34:51.590 --> 34:54.426
- Thrown in solitary.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.595
People die in there.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.631
- Gary Munson forced me
to perform oral sex on him

34:59.631 --> 35:01.933
once a week in Rikers.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.704
Then once a week
when I got out.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.174
The last two times
he raped me...

35:08.174 --> 35:09.841
and attempted to rape me.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.677
- But you didn't report
any of this to the police

35:11.677 --> 35:12.678
until last week?

35:12.678 --> 35:13.845
- No.

35:13.845 --> 35:16.682
He said I was just a...

35:16.682 --> 35:18.784
black crack whore,

35:18.784 --> 35:21.953
and he was a CO...

35:21.953 --> 35:23.789
and nobody
would believe me.

35:23.789 --> 35:25.791
He said if I did
tell anyone,

35:25.791 --> 35:27.092
that he'd have me arrested,

35:27.092 --> 35:28.894
thrown back in Rikers,

35:28.894 --> 35:31.730
and he'd let the gangs
do whatever they wanted to me.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.599
- These attacks,
where did they occur?

35:33.599 --> 35:35.934
- Mostly in his car.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.736
Sometimes at
my boyfriend's apartment,

35:37.736 --> 35:41.540
if Gary knew
that he was locked up.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.610
- How many female inmates
did Gary Munson escort

35:44.610 --> 35:48.380
into the chapel
while you waited outside?

35:48.380 --> 35:50.882
- Six, seven.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.252
Sometimes more.

35:53.252 --> 35:55.221
He had his frequent flyers.

35:55.221 --> 35:57.055
- Hmm.

35:57.055 --> 35:59.458
- But he'd change it up
anytime someone new came in.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.827
- Did he ever tell you what was
going on inside that chapel?

36:01.827 --> 36:03.229
- No.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.364
He didn't have to.

36:05.364 --> 36:08.400
But he did make sure
me and himself got OT,

36:08.400 --> 36:10.302
whether we worked
the hours or not.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.637
- How thoughtful.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.038
Any night in particular?

36:13.038 --> 36:14.906
- Sunday nights.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.408
We'd leave at 6:00,

36:16.408 --> 36:18.510
get credit till midnight.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.546
Like clockwork.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.047
- Mrs. Munson,

36:22.047 --> 36:24.750
would you say your husband
is a hard worker?

36:24.750 --> 36:27.253
- Yes, he is.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.255
Gary only thinks of me
and his kids.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.589
I know he
couldn't have done this.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.857
He loves me,

36:31.857 --> 36:35.060
and we have
a healthy sex life.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.595
- The grand jury
has heard allegations

36:36.595 --> 36:38.163
that he committed rapes
on his way home

36:38.163 --> 36:39.331
on Sunday nights.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.866
- That's impossible.

36:40.866 --> 36:42.668
He always calls
when he's about to leave work,

36:42.668 --> 36:45.571
and he's home
20 minutes later.

36:45.571 --> 36:47.873
- On a Sunday,
what time would that be?

36:47.873 --> 36:49.675
- He'd call at 10:00,

36:49.675 --> 36:51.009
home at 10:20.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.011
- Was he?
That's very interesting.

36:53.011 --> 36:55.080
Here are his time cards

36:55.080 --> 36:59.285
for the past seven Sundays
that he's worked.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.387
He's punched out
at midnight.

37:01.387 --> 37:02.688
- That--that happens.

37:02.688 --> 37:03.955
They get extra time credit

37:03.955 --> 37:05.190
when they work a double.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.958
- A double?

37:06.958 --> 37:08.494
Here's footage...

37:08.494 --> 37:12.197
of one of the CO
checkout points at Rikers,

37:12.197 --> 37:13.599
two weeks ago,
Sunday night.

37:13.599 --> 37:16.101
Can you make out
that time stamp?

37:16.101 --> 37:17.336
- It says 6:05.

37:17.336 --> 37:21.206
[tense music]

37:21.206 --> 37:24.343
- Do you recognize
that man?

37:24.343 --> 37:26.945
Is it your husband?

37:26.945 --> 37:29.848
- Our son may have been
sick that day.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.450
- Has he been sick a lot?

37:31.450 --> 37:33.218
Before you answer,
I'm gonna show you footage

37:33.218 --> 37:35.521
from the previous six Sundays
that he's worked.

37:35.521 --> 37:43.562
*

37:48.233 --> 37:50.035
Thank you for coming.
- What's going on?

37:50.035 --> 37:52.037
- My gut is when the grand jury
gets back from lunch,

37:52.037 --> 37:53.472
they'll return
a bill of indictment

37:53.472 --> 37:55.674
on multiple counts
of rape and sodomy

37:55.674 --> 37:57.175
of both Charisse and Leanne.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.910
Each of their stories
reinforced the other.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.211
Plus the female CO's
testimony.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.847
- Okay, what about Lisa,
the wife?

38:01.847 --> 38:04.716
- She honestly believed
that she could alibi him.

38:04.716 --> 38:06.151
Munson didn't even bother
to tell her

38:06.151 --> 38:07.886
what she was walking into.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.154
- Do you need us
to pick up Munson?

38:09.154 --> 38:10.589
- He's out on bail,

38:10.589 --> 38:12.223
and he surrendered
his SIG and passport.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.459
He'll be informed
of the indictment

38:13.459 --> 38:14.726
through his lawyer.

38:14.726 --> 38:16.595
*

38:16.595 --> 38:18.964
When the indictment
does come down,

38:18.964 --> 38:20.766
I'll need you
to walk me out of here.

38:20.766 --> 38:27.973
*

38:27.973 --> 38:30.175
- These charges
are an outrage and an insult

38:30.175 --> 38:32.678
to every conscientious
corrections officer

38:32.678 --> 38:36.114
who puts his or her life
on the line every day.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.384
Rather than dealing
with the rampant dysfunction

38:38.384 --> 38:40.486
and gang violence
in Rikers,

38:40.486 --> 38:42.621
ADA Barba
and city hall

38:42.621 --> 38:44.089
are leading a witch hunt

38:44.089 --> 38:47.092
based on the implicitly
compromised testimony

38:47.092 --> 38:51.397
of this city's
lowest forms of life.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.998
- You want a war, Barba?
You got it.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.400
We're going to shut
this city down!

38:54.400 --> 38:55.701
- Hold on, guys.
Guys.

38:55.701 --> 38:57.403
There's really
no need for this.

38:57.403 --> 38:59.538
Everyone's just trying to do
their jobs, okay?

38:59.538 --> 39:01.306
So how about you step back
and let us through?

39:01.306 --> 39:03.174
- You don't know
about the day-to-day reality

39:03.174 --> 39:04.676
on Rikers Island.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.512
It's all about the inmates.

39:06.512 --> 39:08.580
My COs get beat up, jumped.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.449
But you lay a hand
on an inmate,

39:10.449 --> 39:12.083
and they write you up.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.453
- Good luck to you when you need
a prisoner to testify.

39:14.453 --> 39:17.122
- You're looking
at a big problem, Mr. Barba.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.524
You're counting
on these guys

39:18.524 --> 39:22.093
to put their life
on the line for you.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.562
That ain't gonna
happen anymore.

39:23.562 --> 39:25.531
- Okay, Mr. Rodriguez.
You've said your piece.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.232
Now, guys,
please, let us through.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.867
Step back.
- And what happens if we don't?

39:28.867 --> 39:30.636
- Hey, just take it easy,
all right?

39:30.636 --> 39:32.438
*

39:32.438 --> 39:34.272
- Barba, you don't know me
or who I am, but we know

39:34.272 --> 39:36.442
a lot about you, things
people would want to know.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.276
- Is that a threat?
- Threat?

39:38.276 --> 39:39.745
No, a threat would be

39:39.745 --> 39:41.747
right here, right now,
I shove you down these steps

39:41.747 --> 39:43.114
and get your skull cracked open,

39:43.114 --> 39:44.616
bleeding to death.

39:44.616 --> 39:46.952
- Right here,
in front of all these people?

39:46.952 --> 39:48.487
Maybe they wouldn't
be able to save me,

39:48.487 --> 39:50.456
but they sure as hell
would catch you.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.291
So, amiguito,
I'll tell you what.

39:53.291 --> 39:55.060
You want to kill a DA,

39:55.060 --> 39:58.263
right here, surrounded
by all these cops and cameras?

39:58.263 --> 40:00.599
Spend the rest
of your life in prison?

40:00.599 --> 40:03.301
Here, here's
my home address.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.903
You come by
any time you want.

40:04.903 --> 40:08.740
*

40:08.740 --> 40:10.241
- Hey.
Everything all right?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.777
- Not really--someone just
threatened to kill me.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.011
- What?
- Who was it?

40:13.011 --> 40:14.412
- Just a face in the crowd.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.414
*

40:16.414 --> 40:18.450
Tell the squad
to watch their backs.

40:18.450 --> 40:20.185
This is just the beginning.

40:20.185 --> 40:28.226
