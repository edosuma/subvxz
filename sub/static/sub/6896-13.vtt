WEBVTT

00:16.100 --> 00:18.851
We got the supplies,
but we were fortunate to get away.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.853
The Empire's making our travels
around the Outer Rim

00:20.938 --> 00:22.105
tougher all the time.

00:22.439 --> 00:27.276
Yes. We need a new hyperspace route
in and out of the Lothal sector.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.112
I may have a perfect shortcut.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.655
The system of Concord Dawn.

00:30.781 --> 00:34.242
It's a Mandalorian colony
and not an Imperial territory yet.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.453
Why not? They've grabbed up
just about every other place.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.623
Concord Dawn is known
for its elite warriors.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.126
They were brought in
to train clones back in the war.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.212
Bet even the Empire thinks twice
about a fight with them.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.215
The question is, who are they loyal to?

00:49.550 --> 00:52.760
The Empire does occupy
their home world of Mandalore,

00:52.845 --> 00:55.471
so Imperial influence could be a factor.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.348
Years before the Clone Wars broke out,

00:57.433 --> 00:59.684
the Mandalorians were already
at war with each other.

00:59.810 --> 01:02.019
This group call themselves
the Protectors.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.896
They like to make up their own rules.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.189
Sounds familiar.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.941
So we go in with strength,

01:07.067 --> 01:10.361
scout the system for defenses
to see what we're up against.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.572
Or why not try diplomacy?

01:12.656 --> 01:15.074
Ask permission
to use their system as a shortcut.

01:15.159 --> 01:16.868
Diplomacy?

01:16.952 --> 01:20.246
Warriors like these
only understand strength.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.581
He's got a point.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.250
But we shouldn't make an enemy
if we don't need to.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.753
lf we get permission
to fly through their space,

01:26.837 --> 01:28.713
the next step could be recruitment.

01:28.839 --> 01:32.216
To grow the rebellion, we need
friends like these Mandalorians.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.595
We could have our route
and a powerful ally as well.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.973
Very well, Captain Syndulla.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.850
The mission is yours.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.727
Okay if I tag along?

01:42.811 --> 01:44.854
I was hoping you'd ask.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.023
Looks like diplomacy
won the day for once.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.984
There was a time
when it always won the day.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.749
So, that's Concord Dawn.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.542
Sure looks like it's been through a war.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.879
This system has endured
more than 100 wars.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.215
My people don't need a reason
to pick a fight.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.719
Phoenix Squadron, we have visitors.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.140
Everybody, stay sharp.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.439
Attention, unregistered ships.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.692
This is Fenn Rau,
Protector of Concord Dawn.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.821
You are trespassing.
Identify yourselves.

02:35.072 --> 02:36.614
We come in peace, Protector.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.865
Peace?

02:37.950 --> 02:40.243
That's not a word I hear often.
State your mission.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.912
We request safe passage
through your system.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.789
Well, that depends. Who is asking?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.458
Those who would stand
with Concord Dawn

02:47.543 --> 02:49.252
against the Empire.

02:49.545 --> 02:51.212
So you're the rebels I've heard about.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.839
How unfortunate for you.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.507
You haven't heard
what we have to say.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.760
I don't need to. Out here,
I act in the name of the Empire.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.432
Hold on, Protector.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.270
I'm hit!

03:08.355 --> 03:11.065
Hera, what do we do? What do we do?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.283
I don't think they're interested
in talking, Hera.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.368
Phoenix Squadron, take evasive action.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.238
Spectre-5, Phoenix-2, get out of here.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.324
There's too much fire.
I can't get an opening.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.748
He's right. lf we attempt to jump,
we'll be cut to pieces.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.917
Go to heading 257.
I'll get your opening.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.836
-What about you?
-Just follow orders, Sabine.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.880
Roger that.

04:27.225 --> 04:30.019
That's it, Protector. Follow me.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.985
What are you up to?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.575
Hera, where's that opening?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.495
Prepare to jump.

04:50.374 --> 04:51.999
Coordinates set.
Thanks, Phoenix Leader.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.503
Get going, Sabine.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.712
Not without you.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.340
Just go! I'll be right behind you.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.800
Close ranks.

05:27.911 --> 05:28.995
Sabine, what happened?

05:29.079 --> 05:30.997
We picked up a distress call.
Where's Hera?

05:31.081 --> 05:32.415
She was right behind me.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.208
Kanan, we didn't have a chance.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.752
These Mandalorians
work for the Empire, too.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.927
Hera.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.263
Hera, can you hear me?

05:50.767 --> 05:53.519
I see her. I see her, Kanan. It's bad.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.193
You've got to hurry. Please, hurry!

06:07.868 --> 06:08.868
How is she?

06:08.952 --> 06:12.621
Her vital signs have stabilized.
She is going to make it.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.582
But she requires rest.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.460
This is my fault.
I shouldn't have left her.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.253
There's nothing you could have done.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.547
I'm just glad
you're both back in one piece.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.674
Commander Sato
wants the details on what happened.

06:23.759 --> 06:26.594
-Yeah, I'll be right there.
-Okay.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.017
I'm so sorry, Hera.

06:33.101 --> 06:35.478
They're going to answer for this.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.861
Fenn Rau,
the Protector of Concord Dawn.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.405
That's who did this.
That's who we're up against.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.866
Rex, does that name
sound familiar to you?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.409
It sure does.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.287
Fenn Rau was a fighter pilot instructor

06:53.371 --> 06:55.247
for the Grand Army of the Republic.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.917
-He also served...
-At the Battle of Mygeeto.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.002
I know. I was there.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.837
That was a long time ago.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.465
So I guess negotiating's
been taken off the table?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.050
Yeah? You want to negotiate?

07:06.134 --> 07:09.845
Let's negotiate,
by destroying their ability to attack us.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.306
I tracked them
from Concord Dawn's third moon.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.724
They must have a base there.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.311
lf they scan our fleet approaching,
their fighters will cut us to pieces.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.522
Then I guess we'll have to hit 'em
before they take off.

07:19.898 --> 07:21.982
You think you can infiltrate their base?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.150
I believe I can.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.528
We can take out their fighters,
all of them.

07:26.822 --> 07:29.323
It's risky, but I approve.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.866
Well, I don't.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.119
This is a solo mission,
and I'm taking it.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.371
I'm already one man down.
I won't risk anyone else.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.501
Kanan, I know the Mandalorians.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.711
You need me on this mission.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.297
-No way.
-We're a team.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.882
You can't go without us.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.468
All right. I'll take Chopper.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.721
But that's all.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.724
And this is not open
for further discussion.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.393
Come on, Chopper.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.563
Come on, Chopper!

08:16.413 --> 08:19.415
I can hear you.
And, yes, I know what I'm doing.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.000
Just program the nav computer.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.854
Chopper, load up the intel
Sabine gathered.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.606
We can pinpoint where their base is.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.195
What do you mean, "Just ask her?"

08:49.321 --> 08:51.822
He means I'm standing
right behind you.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.199
Better jam those scanners.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.742
What are you doing here?

08:54.826 --> 08:58.162
You must be pretty distracted
not to have noticed I stowed away.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.331
So, what are you really up to?

09:00.415 --> 09:01.916
You heard Sato's orders.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.251
I'm gonna destroy those fighters
before they take off.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.545
I know you better than that.

09:06.630 --> 09:09.089
Fine. I'm going to finish Hera's mission.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.634
We need to recruit the Mandalorians
to join the rebellion.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.054
The Protectors almost killed Hera.
What are you thinking?

09:15.138 --> 09:18.140
I'm thinking we can still offer them
a chance to change.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.100
Everyone deserves a chance.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.687
You know, this Jedi philosophy stuff
doesn't work for everyone.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.148
That's why we're at war.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.435
Well? What are we up against?

10:03.645 --> 10:07.064
Including the two starfighters on patrol?
Eight ships total.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.107
But they're spread out,

10:08.191 --> 10:10.109
so it's gonna take me a while
to plant charges.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.403
I think I brought enough explosives.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.613
You always bring enough explosives.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.115
Hopefully you won't have to use 'em.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.866
Now get down. They got company.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.460
Looks like the Empire
bought their loyalty.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.796
See the Mandalorian
accepting the credits?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.090
That's their leader, Fenn Rau.

10:33.341 --> 10:35.676
Here is the payment
for the next rotation.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.262
This arrangement is working
to your benefit.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.055
I encountered a squadron of rebels.

10:40.223 --> 10:41.223
The rebel fleet?

10:41.391 --> 10:43.309
Not an entire fleet. A couple fighters.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.935
But my men and I took care of them.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.188
lf they return, be sure to contact us.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.819
Sounds like your negotiations
are gonna go great.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.114
What's the plan?
I mean, if diplomacy doesn't work.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.450
You give me a chance
to recruit the Mandalorians.

10:59.534 --> 11:02.077
lf that doesn't work out,
then you get to blow up their fighters.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.537
We have a deal?

11:03.621 --> 11:05.748
Fine. But not just the ships.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.709
Rau has to pay for what he did to Hera.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.586
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

11:23.641 --> 11:25.809
Two rebels burned. The rest fled.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.103
He wants us to stay on guard.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.106
Plant your bombs,
but wait for my signal.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.529
All right.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.448
Hey. I trust you.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.301
Pretty bold to sneak onto my base.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.471
I'm gonna assume you're one of those
rebels I dealt with earlier.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.599
That's a pretty good guess,
but not the entire truth.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.893
I don't recognize you,
so before I gun you down,

12:07.977 --> 12:09.978
why don't you tell me what you want?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.442
We never met, but I do know you.

12:15.527 --> 12:17.111
ln fact, I came to thank you.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.823
ln the Clone Wars, you fought in
the Third Battle of Mygeeto.

12:21.783 --> 12:22.825
And I was there.

12:24.661 --> 12:26.161
You're a survivor.

12:27.330 --> 12:29.748
But that explains
how you got past my men.

12:29.833 --> 12:34.336
My master, Depa Billaba, and I
were pinned down, trapped by droids.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.755
You and your Skull Squadron
flew into the Separatist fire

12:36.840 --> 12:38.674
over and over to cover us.

12:38.842 --> 12:39.842
You saved our lives.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.594
That was a long time ago.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.305
I was younger and more reckless then.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.641
To be honest, I don't see what
that has to do with you being here.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.102
You gave me a chance to live that day.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.812
Now, I'd like to return the favor.

13:41.571 --> 13:42.905
What was that?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.470
How's it going, boys?

14:07.555 --> 14:09.890
Where did you steal that armor from,
bounty hunter?

14:10.225 --> 14:12.100
Bounty hunter? Not lately.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.728
I forged this armor with my family.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.314
Family? That's a bold claim.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.899
What's your house?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.402
I'm Clan Wren, House Vizsla.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.780
-House Vizsla?
-She's Death Watch.

14:24.906 --> 14:27.449
-Traitor!
-My mother was, but I'm not.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.451
I came here to settle a score,

14:29.827 --> 14:33.497
and I invoke the code
to seek justice through single combat.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.416
No one has invoked the code
since the Empire took over.

14:38.044 --> 14:41.547
Well, who's in charge here?
The Empire or Mandalore?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.259
I already fought
one losing war for the Jedi.

14:45.343 --> 14:46.510
I'm not fighting another.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.720
You can't possibly
believe in the Empire.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.973
I believe they have the strength
to defeat you,

14:51.057 --> 14:53.225
and the resources to back it up.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.393
Why would I fight the Empire

14:54.477 --> 14:57.062
when obviously destroying you
is so much easier?

14:57.272 --> 15:00.816
You must know the Empire
isn't interested in sharing their power.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.734
ln the end, everyone is their enemy.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.821
lf we don't stand together,
then we're all alone.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.034
Alone is who we are.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.830
Sir. We have an infiltrator.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.499
Don't worry.
I have the Jedi under control.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.418
I don't know anything about this Jedi,

15:19.502 --> 15:21.962
but a Mandalorian trespasser
has invoked the code.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.089
She claims she's House Vizsla.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.425
I assume she came here with you?

15:26.509 --> 15:27.926
Let me handle this.

15:28.052 --> 15:31.054
I'm afraid it's out of your control now,
Jedi.

15:33.099 --> 15:35.976
Sabine, I thought we had an agreement.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.185
They started it.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.646
Your house is an enemy
to the Protectors.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.065
Call out your opponent
for combat to the death.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.152
I thought you'd never ask.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.446
I call out you, Fenn Rau.

15:47.530 --> 15:50.240
You're gonna pay
for what you did to Hera.

15:52.076 --> 15:56.330
Just like I said.
You rebels fight battles you can't win.

15:56.414 --> 15:59.875
I assume Hera is the pilot
I shot to pieces earlier.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.460
I guess she didn't make it.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.545
She's alive. Barely.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.216
I got to admit
this is an interesting development.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.845
One of you came here to befriend me,
the other came to kill me.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.014
We can't let you attack our fleet.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.391
But we'd rather leave here as friends.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.185
He's already the enemy.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.479
Sabine, you know
this isn't what Hera wanted.

16:20.730 --> 16:21.980
She didn't want to create enemies

16:22.065 --> 16:23.982
and she wouldn't want you to die.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.068
I'm not planning on dying.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.986
I'm afraid the only way
you're getting out of here alive

16:28.071 --> 16:31.031
is if she kills me,
and that is not going to happen.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.783
What is it with you Mandalorians,

16:32.867 --> 16:35.911
never knowing how to solve anything
except through the end of a blaster?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.498
Sabine, you do this,
you're no better than him.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.333
You have to trust me.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.419
Sabine, you make this choice
and, win or lose,

16:44.504 --> 16:48.173
the Empire is going to be
all over this system and the fleet.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.801
Kanan, you need to stop talking now.

17:04.232 --> 17:06.566
There are alternatives to killing.

17:16.911 --> 17:17.911
Come on!

17:21.624 --> 17:24.835
Capture them alive.
I want them to watch their fleet burn.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.887
Are you feeling better now?
You got to blow stuff up.

17:35.972 --> 17:38.098
I thought you'd be happy
I didn't kill anyone.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.227
Actually, I'm thrilled.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.979
Well, here's the bad news,

17:44.147 --> 17:45.897
Rau's fighter
is at the far end of the field,

17:45.982 --> 17:48.734
and I wasn't able to set the charges on it
before they captured me.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.902
-You're saying we should go after him?
-Yes!

17:51.028 --> 17:53.488
For the first time today,
we agree on something.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.366
Fine. But we are still not killing anyone.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.660
You love making this hard for me.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.491
Chopper, I think we're done here.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.709
Kanan, how's the plan going?

18:49.504 --> 18:50.629
Just get up here!

18:50.713 --> 18:52.214
Okay! Hang on!

19:07.730 --> 19:09.523
Still think we can't win?

19:14.362 --> 19:15.445
Our ride's here.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.280
No!

19:28.918 --> 19:30.043
Kanan!

19:36.926 --> 19:40.136
When you set your mind to something,
you're kind of frightening.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.273
-How do you feel?
-Like a prisoner.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.278
-Better get that.
-Are you crazy?

19:56.445 --> 19:59.447
You can't let a prisoner
receive outside communications.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.868
Just answer it.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.452
Sir, are you all right?

20:04.579 --> 20:07.998
We're marshaling
our reserve starfighters for pursuit.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.625
Stand down. There's no need.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.378
But, sir, if the Empire finds out
about your capture...

20:13.462 --> 20:14.921
You're not gonna let that happen.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.339
And the rebels?

20:16.424 --> 20:19.551
Until I give the word,
there is to be no mention of the rebels.

20:19.635 --> 20:22.804
And their ships are to be granted
safe passage through our system.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.389
As you wish.

20:31.314 --> 20:33.106
Welcome to the Rebellion.

20:33.190 --> 20:36.401
Right now, we are only friends
because we have to be.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.572
What does that mean?

20:40.656 --> 20:43.658
Well, the Empire doesn't make
a habit of rescuing people.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.828
The last thing Rau wants
is Imperial ships all over his territory,

20:46.913 --> 20:49.414
and that's exactly what he'd get
if they found out he was our prisoner.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.707
Kanan. Sabine.

20:51.542 --> 20:53.084
Hera wants to see you.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.843
I hear we're taking prisoners now.

21:02.136 --> 21:05.805
I like to think of him
more as a reluctant recruit.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.309
It was better than the alternative.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.645
We're not at war with the Protectors.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.023
There was no need to take their lives
if we didn't have to.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.693
Sabine, you're sounding
more like a Jedi than a Mandalorian.

21:18.861 --> 21:21.363
Well, I guess I've just been raised right.
