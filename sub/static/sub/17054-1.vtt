01:08.886 --> 01:10.888
Hello. Hello.

01:23.066 --> 01:24.989
I wonder what's holding them up.

01:25.068 --> 01:27.992
Don't worry about that, Father.
We'll be going soon.

01:30.199 --> 01:33.502
John, did you feed them hounds?
Yes, Grandpa, yes.

01:33.577 --> 01:36.672
All right.
Now tighten her up, Son.

01:36.747 --> 01:39.125
She'll take us
where we're going.

01:40.292 --> 01:42.215
Yes, but where
are we going?

01:42.294 --> 01:45.013
Now, Ma, they're thrashin' that
matter out over there now.

01:45.088 --> 01:47.511
Pa, they made you the leader.

01:47.591 --> 01:49.013
Why don't you say
where to go?

01:49.092 --> 01:51.436
I'm only leader of
the Missourians, Daughter.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.857
There are families here from every
state in the Union, I reckon.

01:54.932 --> 01:56.058
Can't be waitin' on
'em forever, Dad.

01:56.141 --> 01:57.233
No, Son.

01:57.309 --> 01:59.687
They're holding a powwow
over there now.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.694
I'll just step over and see
what they got to say.

02:04.775 --> 02:10.453
Well, bless our wild heart.
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

02:10.948 --> 02:12.416
How are you, Zeke?

02:12.491 --> 02:15.540
Where at you been hidin' yourself
for the last year, boy?

02:15.619 --> 02:18.543
Been down Santa Fe way, Zeke.
Just drifted in.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.169
And here's Windy Bill.
Looks like you've

02:20.249 --> 02:21.751
wintered through
in good shape.

02:21.833 --> 02:25.963
Well, Coleman, most times I
winter through in fair shape.

02:26.046 --> 02:30.768
This year, when the first grass
showed, I'd only put on 60 pounds.

02:33.095 --> 02:35.439
Say, Bascom, he maybe could

02:35.514 --> 02:37.858
tell us of a likely
stretch of country.

02:37.933 --> 02:42.439
Breck, could you sight us to a second
Missouri anywheres out yonder?

02:42.521 --> 02:47.243
Sure. But it's a long,
tough pull from here.

02:47.317 --> 02:50.241
2,500 mile the way
you'd have to go.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.453
No, it's too far off.

02:53.532 --> 02:55.955
No place is too far
if it's what we want.

02:56.034 --> 02:57.661
This is a land
beyond Oregon.

02:57.744 --> 03:00.418
There ain't no land
beyond Oregon, mister.

03:00.497 --> 03:03.296
West of Oregon comes the ocean,
way it's been told to me.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.298
This stretch is
north of Oregon.

03:05.377 --> 03:07.596
How many people
settled on it now?

03:07.671 --> 03:09.048
It's Indian country.

03:09.131 --> 03:13.136
Except for the trappers, never a
white man has left his track there.

03:13.218 --> 03:15.391
Only one trading post
in that whole country.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.517
Who owns it?

03:16.597 --> 03:17.940
A Missouri trapper owns it.

03:18.015 --> 03:19.813
Hey, mister, will you tell me this...

03:19.891 --> 03:21.643
Hey, hey, there.

03:21.727 --> 03:23.855
Since you all
elected me the he-coon

03:23.937 --> 03:26.031
of this outfit,
let me do the talking.

03:26.481 --> 03:29.360
It's everything a Missourian's
heart could crave.

03:29.443 --> 03:33.698
There's two snow-capped mountain
ranges with peaks lost in the sky.

03:34.031 --> 03:37.786
And between them ranges, men,
is a great valley.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.916
Lakes and streams everywhere.

03:39.995 --> 03:42.248
Fish, you ask, and game?

03:42.331 --> 03:43.958
There's salmon
swarmin' up them rivers

03:44.041 --> 03:45.634
thicker than blackbirds
in a cane patch.

03:45.709 --> 03:48.804
Friend, will you undertake
to lead us to that valley?

03:48.879 --> 03:51.849
I'd like nothin'
better, men...

03:51.923 --> 03:54.301
But our trails fork here.

03:54.384 --> 03:55.636
I've got
business that calls me

03:55.719 --> 03:57.596
back down
the road Santa Fe way.

03:57.679 --> 03:59.056
What business do
you follow, friend?

03:59.139 --> 04:00.140
I'm a trapper.

04:00.223 --> 04:01.975
Well, surely there's
fur aplenty

04:02.059 --> 04:03.811
out in that land
beyond Oregon.

04:03.894 --> 04:05.817
Plenty.

04:05.896 --> 04:08.775
But I gotta kill me
a pair of skunks,

04:08.857 --> 04:10.780
back apiece on
the road to Santa Fe.

04:10.859 --> 04:14.989
Hey, wait, wait. Friend, how
do you find that valley?

04:15.072 --> 04:17.325
Wellmore here is
sending a bull train clear

04:17.406 --> 04:20.160
through to old Tom Williams's
trading post.

04:20.243 --> 04:22.496
First time
it's ever been tried.

04:22.579 --> 04:27.210
String along behind them and, if they
make it through, you'll find your valley.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.216
And tell that great white
mountain hello for me.

04:30.295 --> 04:31.672
Good-bye, Zeke.

04:31.755 --> 04:34.133
Well, thanks, boy.

04:34.216 --> 04:35.763
Hey!

04:36.885 --> 04:39.479
Hey, maybe he fed us a fairy tale.

05:01.284 --> 05:03.002
Now don't be a pig,
you know.

05:03.078 --> 05:05.251
Howdy, Mrs. Riggs.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.456
Land's sakes!

05:09.543 --> 05:11.841
Well, you sure look fine,
Mother Riggs.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.843
It's a long time
since I've seen you.

05:15.006 --> 05:17.509
You know, you always was
a great hand to wander.

05:17.592 --> 05:19.845
Yeah, I ramble around.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.305
And how are
the little twins?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.641
Little? My lands!

05:23.724 --> 05:26.227
Them girls has grown
since you seen 'em last.

05:26.309 --> 05:27.310
No!
Mm-hmm.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.566
They in the house?

05:28.645 --> 05:31.774
Mildred is. Elise went down
to watch the boat come in.

05:31.857 --> 05:33.905
I reckon I'll saunter in
and surprise Mildred.

05:33.984 --> 05:36.078
Oh, you sure will
surprise them.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.754
Well, Breck, I sure am
glad to see you.

05:52.836 --> 05:54.804
Well, you certainly
have doubled in size

05:54.880 --> 05:56.848
since last I set
eyes on you, Mildred.

05:56.923 --> 05:58.925
You just must see Elise.

05:59.009 --> 06:01.558
I'll surely see
her before I leave.

06:01.845 --> 06:04.348
<i>There's the
Peensie Bell whistling now.</i>

06:06.475 --> 06:07.727
Ooh, look at the crowd.

06:07.809 --> 06:08.856
Oh, look.

06:19.529 --> 06:22.783
Okay. I guess it is
important to have everything ready.

06:22.866 --> 06:23.958
I have everything ready.

06:24.034 --> 06:27.004
Well, Miss Cameron, we be
landin' in a few minutes.

06:27.078 --> 06:28.375
Got all your
outfit together?

06:28.455 --> 06:29.707
Most everything's ready,
Captain Hollister.

06:29.790 --> 06:34.261
Listen, why don't you give up
this plan and turn back?

06:34.336 --> 06:37.135
Why, there's no place
to turn back to.

06:37.214 --> 06:40.639
Why, there isn't a home in all the South
that wouldn't welcome the daughter

06:40.717 --> 06:41.809
of Colonel Cameron.

06:41.885 --> 06:45.105
True. But we can hardly
become perpetual visitors.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.308
It's a tough
proposition, girl,

06:47.390 --> 06:50.189
this pioneer life in
a savage wilderness.

06:50.268 --> 06:52.362
We realize that,
Captain Hollister,

06:52.437 --> 06:54.690
but we must keep
the family together.

06:54.773 --> 06:57.071
Honey Girl wants to stay with
her sister Ruth, doesn't she?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.322
Yes, I do.

06:58.401 --> 07:01.496
And our brother Dave's
almost a man grown.

07:01.571 --> 07:05.576
Ruth is right, Captain. The Cameron
tribe must stick together.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.006
Say, you're
just the fella I want to see.

07:16.086 --> 07:18.885
I want to play some more
of that shell game.

07:20.674 --> 07:21.926
Have you got
any more money?

07:22.008 --> 07:24.261
Oh, sure I got some money.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.138
Where'd you get that?

07:27.222 --> 07:28.314
From my mother-in-law.

07:28.390 --> 07:32.065
She lend it to me,
but she don't know it.

07:32.143 --> 07:34.817
Here, I'll meet you below deck.
Get along.

07:34.896 --> 07:36.990
Don't forget.
I wait there for you.

07:46.324 --> 07:49.043
Are you still determined
to be a sturdy pioneer?

07:49.119 --> 07:51.713
Quite determined,
Mr. Thorpe.

07:51.788 --> 07:55.759
I've told you about
my plantation in Louisiana.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.882
It must be wonderful.

07:57.961 --> 08:01.340
Miss Cameron, those lands
and servants are yours,

08:01.423 --> 08:03.471
if you'll take me with them.

08:03.550 --> 08:07.646
Why, I do thank you. But as I've
said before, it's quite impossible.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.769
Good-bye, Mr. Thorpe.

08:15.186 --> 08:17.029
Now, if I win,
I'm going to keep it.

08:17.105 --> 08:20.200
But if I lose, I give
my mother-in-law half.

08:22.277 --> 08:23.699
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Here we are again.

08:23.778 --> 08:24.950
Hello, Thorpe.

08:25.030 --> 08:27.829
Well, Gussie, you want to see the
elusive little ball under the shells.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.582
There you are. Now it's bound
to be under one of them.

08:30.660 --> 08:34.039
There's one, there's two,
and there's three.

08:34.121 --> 08:37.422
Now we'll shuffle them just a
little bit, just to confuse you.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.467
And take your choice.

08:39.544 --> 08:42.263
Now wait, I show you.
Here, I bet you two dollars.

08:42.339 --> 08:44.967
Two dollars. Covered.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.597
I always do that
for good luck.

08:48.553 --> 08:50.851
Now wait. I show you.
Now watch.

08:54.726 --> 08:57.354
Ah, you see, Gussie, the
hand is faster than the eye.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.859
Better luck next time.

09:06.071 --> 09:09.450
Oh, here. Who wants to buy
my mother-in-law's stocking?

09:09.532 --> 09:12.752
Gus!

09:12.827 --> 09:16.377
Oh, there you are. What do you
mean by spending my money?

09:16.456 --> 09:20.131
But, Mama, I'm going
to give you half.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.462
Give me my money.

09:21.544 --> 09:22.716
Give it to her.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.391
Hurry UP-

09:26.675 --> 09:28.643
Give me the rest of it.

09:28.718 --> 09:29.890
Why, madam,
that's my own money.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.062
That's my money.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.606
No, no, Mama.
That's his money.

09:35.016 --> 09:37.769
Captain, I demand that
that man give me my money.

09:37.852 --> 09:39.854
Hand it over.

09:42.941 --> 09:45.911
See, Mama? Didn't I
tell you we would win?

09:45.986 --> 09:50.332
Why, you big loafer! Get out of here!
Spending my life's earnings!

09:50.407 --> 09:52.956
Now, Thorpe,
you get off of my boat.

09:53.034 --> 09:55.457
If you set foot on it again,
I'll put you in irons

09:55.537 --> 09:58.131
and land you at St. Charles
on my way back.

10:06.131 --> 10:08.350
Davey, I think I better
go find Mrs. Riggs,

10:08.425 --> 10:10.848
that lady Captain Hollister
told us about.

10:10.927 --> 10:12.019
Come on, Honey Girl.

10:12.095 --> 10:14.189
No. I want to stay here with
Davey and watch them unload.

10:14.264 --> 10:15.481
Well, you take good
care of her, Davey.

10:15.557 --> 10:16.524
I will.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.693
I'll be right back,
Honey Girl.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.235
It's a nice place, ain't it, Mama?

10:22.313 --> 10:25.567
It's terrible!
Look at the mud!

10:25.650 --> 10:28.278
Well, listen, Mama, I gonna
go see if I can buy a horse.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.284
Come on. Come on.
I carry you over there.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.583
I don't want you to get your feet wet.
That's it. Here we go.

10:38.496 --> 10:40.965
Now you stay there.
I bring Abbie over.

10:41.041 --> 10:44.011
Come on, Abbie. I don't want you
to get your shoes all muddy.

10:44.085 --> 10:45.211
That's it.
Come on. Here we go.

10:46.421 --> 10:49.766
Oh, stop laughing,
will you, Abbie?

10:49.841 --> 10:53.061
That's it. Now you wait here.
I bring Mama.

10:53.136 --> 10:55.935
Come on, Mama.
I take you over, Mama.

10:56.014 --> 10:57.937
Come on, Mama.

10:58.016 --> 10:59.313
Come on, Mama. It's...

10:59.392 --> 11:01.941
Here! What are
you trying to do?

11:02.020 --> 11:03.317
But, Mama,
I want to carry you across

11:03.396 --> 11:05.069
so you won't
get your feet wet.

11:05.148 --> 11:08.197
You? I'll cross
my own mud.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.576
All right then, Mama, but let me help you.
That's it, Mama. Come on now.

11:11.654 --> 11:14.498
Okay, step on that board, Mama.
That's it, Mama.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.167
Ohh!

11:16.242 --> 11:18.290
Say, I come right back.

11:18.369 --> 11:19.962
Ohh! Oh, Gus!

11:23.792 --> 11:26.261
Uh, Mrs. Riggs?

11:26.336 --> 11:28.179
Yes, miss. That's me.

11:28.254 --> 11:32.134
Well, I'm Miss Cameron. Captain
Hollister told me to see you.

11:32.217 --> 11:33.264
Friend of
Captain Hollister?

11:33.343 --> 11:34.344
Yes, lam.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.270
Come right on in.
Oh, thank you.

11:36.346 --> 11:38.474
Now don't tear your pretty
dress on them logs.

11:41.518 --> 11:43.941
Oh, it's nice and cool
in here out of the sun.

11:56.032 --> 11:57.534
Now you sit down,
make yourself easy,

11:57.617 --> 11:59.085
and I'll brew
you a cup of tea.

11:59.160 --> 12:02.539
Oh, that's awfully nice of
you, Mrs. Riggs. Thank you.

12:21.724 --> 12:23.818
No! Wha...

12:24.227 --> 12:25.854
Why, what do
you mean by...

12:25.937 --> 12:26.938
Oh, I thought...

12:27.021 --> 12:28.523
Oh! Oh!

12:28.940 --> 12:31.693
It was thisaway, ma'am, I
thought you were someone else.

12:31.776 --> 12:35.201
Wait! It was thisaway. I
thought you were Elise, ma'am.

12:35.280 --> 12:36.327
Elise?

12:36.406 --> 12:38.158
Yes. Just thought
I'd surprise her sort of.

12:38.241 --> 12:39.993
Did you indeed?

12:40.702 --> 12:42.704
Let me tell ya.

12:44.122 --> 12:46.045
If you'll light someplace,
I'll tell ya.

12:46.124 --> 12:47.171
Oh!

12:53.506 --> 12:54.849
Oh.

12:54.924 --> 12:56.426
What is it?
You're as pale as a ghost.

12:56.509 --> 12:58.386
Oh, it's nothing,
Mr. Thorpe. Really. I...

12:58.511 --> 13:00.434
But there must be something wrong.
Oh, nothing.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.515
Just an
unpleasant occurrence.

13:02.599 --> 13:03.942
I'm gonna
explain that play.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.314
There's nothing to explain.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.690
But I'm gonna
tell you anyhow.

13:06.769 --> 13:09.192
It seems to me you're forcing
yourself on this lady.

13:09.272 --> 13:10.364
Is that how
it seems to you?

13:10.440 --> 13:11.862
How else can I take it?

13:11.941 --> 13:14.035
It's nothing to me
how you take it.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.363
But it matters a heap to me,
ma'am, how you understand.

13:16.446 --> 13:19.040
Perhaps not. But if it
concerns Miss Cameron,

13:19.115 --> 13:20.287
I'll demand an explanation.

13:20.366 --> 13:22.710
You will?
Then speak your piece.

13:22.785 --> 13:27.165
Mr. Thorpe, will... Will you
please take me to my brother?

13:27.248 --> 13:30.843
With pleasure. I'll be
looking for you shortly.

13:30.919 --> 13:33.923
Well, I won't be
hard to locate.

13:43.348 --> 13:44.816
Hello, Honey Girl.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.188
Hello.

13:46.267 --> 13:48.019
Thank you so much,
Mr. Thorpe.

13:48.102 --> 13:50.025
It's a great pleasure.

13:50.104 --> 13:54.200
Just think. This wagon will be
your home for the next six months.

13:54.275 --> 13:58.280
And after that,
a cabin in the wilderness.

13:58.363 --> 14:00.741
My mind is made up,
Mr. Thorpe.

14:00.823 --> 14:03.417
We're going
with the settlers.

14:03.493 --> 14:05.166
You know my brother David.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.246
Yes.

14:06.329 --> 14:07.672
Hello, Dave.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.124
How do you do?

14:10.750 --> 14:11.751
Howdy, DOV!

14:11.834 --> 14:13.802
Hello, Zeke.
Howdy, Bill.

14:13.878 --> 14:17.382
Hey, Jack, I been tellin' you
about this here boy Coleman.

14:17.465 --> 14:20.639
He can heave a knife
into a mark so big every time.

14:20.718 --> 14:22.595
I'll bet you
a buffalo hide he can't

14:22.679 --> 14:24.556
heave it into
that post back of ya.

14:24.639 --> 14:28.985
Call the bet! Now here.
Show him, boy.

14:40.029 --> 14:42.282
Bless our wild heart!

14:42.365 --> 14:44.993
Oh, I've seen him do it
a hundred times, eh, Bill?

14:45.076 --> 14:48.080
That's another buffalo hide
you owe me, Jack.

14:48.162 --> 14:50.836
You remember, Bill, that time
up, uh, on the Snake River...

14:50.915 --> 14:52.337
Oh, I sure do.

14:52.417 --> 14:56.843
Say, boy, I want to know
about old Ben Griswell.

14:56.921 --> 14:59.299
I hear the
Indians downed him.

14:59.382 --> 15:01.384
Only it wasn't
Injuns downed him.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.969
No?

15:03.052 --> 15:04.269
Renegade whites done it.

15:04.345 --> 15:05.517
How come?

15:06.055 --> 15:07.227
He'd been wolf in'
all winter.

15:07.307 --> 15:08.433
Yeah?

15:08.516 --> 15:11.269
Must've had $2,000, $3,000
worth of wolf pelts.

15:11.352 --> 15:12.478
Oh, easy that.

15:12.562 --> 15:16.157
He was hacked up
and stuck full of arrows.

15:16.232 --> 15:19.156
Looked like Injun work,
all right.

15:19.235 --> 15:21.454
The wolf pelts was gone.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.658
If ever I find
them hellhounds,

15:24.741 --> 15:27.290
I'll sure make 'em
hunt their holes.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.085
Come on.

15:42.592 --> 15:47.519
Lopez, who's that young buck over
there with no hair on his face?

15:47.597 --> 15:51.397
That's, uh, Breck Coleman.
He very quick with his knife.

15:51.476 --> 15:53.399
Oh, where's he come from?

15:53.478 --> 15:56.698
He come from the plains,
the mountains.

15:56.773 --> 15:58.696
He live with the Indians.

15:58.775 --> 16:01.870
He can throw a knife
through the heart in 20 feet.

16:01.944 --> 16:05.198
He's the best shot
in all this country.

16:05.281 --> 16:07.204
He knows everything.

16:07.283 --> 16:10.127
He'll know too much
for his own good someday.

16:17.794 --> 16:20.798
Yes. All right.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.805
If old Ben had lived, he'd be going
on about 72 now, wouldn't he?

16:51.119 --> 16:53.338
Injuns never done this.

16:55.123 --> 16:57.217
It was renegade whites.

17:06.968 --> 17:09.141
And they've left their mark.

17:25.569 --> 17:27.288
Oh, I'd say I do.

17:29.157 --> 17:32.878
Say, Zeke, who was that
he-grizzly that just went by?

17:32.952 --> 17:35.205
Why, that's Red Flack. He's
bullwhackin' for Wellmore.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.632
He's gonna whack Wellmore's
train clear through to Oregon.

17:37.707 --> 17:41.337
You reckon you'll ever find
out who downed old Ben?

17:41.419 --> 17:45.890
It's just possible that a certain
low-down coyote left his sign there.

17:51.846 --> 17:53.189
Well, hello, Coleman.

17:53.264 --> 17:54.607
Howdy, Wellmore.

17:54.682 --> 17:58.732
I've changed my mind. I'll scout
for that bull train after all.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.779
Well, that's a ray
of sunshine.

18:00.855 --> 18:03.278
Shake hands afore you
change your mind again.

18:03.357 --> 18:04.825
Got a good wagon boss
for the trip?

18:04.901 --> 18:06.278
Red Flack.

18:06.569 --> 18:09.072
A burly ruffian,
but he can maul

18:09.155 --> 18:11.624
the toughest traitor on
the plains into a pulp

18:11.699 --> 18:13.701
without even
working up a sweat.

18:13.784 --> 18:14.831
He can do that, eh?

18:14.911 --> 18:16.333
Flack? Ha!

18:16.412 --> 18:18.756
Why, he likes to do it.
But he can run

18:18.831 --> 18:21.129
a bull train.
Here he comes now.

18:21.209 --> 18:23.507
Well, Wellmore,
all ready to start?

18:23.586 --> 18:26.055
Likely you two
have met before.

18:28.257 --> 18:29.554
Nah.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.728
I reckon not.

18:31.802 --> 18:34.521
Coleman's gonna scout for the train.

18:34.597 --> 18:36.816
You understand, Flack,

18:36.891 --> 18:40.361
that he's to have final say in all
matters dealing with the Indians.

18:40.436 --> 18:46.193
Yes? Well, who's got the final say
about bossin' this bull train?

18:46.275 --> 18:48.869
He understands that
you're the wagon boss.

18:48.945 --> 18:50.947
Yeah. Another thing,
another thing...

18:51.030 --> 18:53.408
Am I supposed to
be wet nurse to them

18:53.491 --> 18:56.745
woodenhead pilgrims
a-crossin' the plains?

18:56.827 --> 18:58.921
The more that goes along,
the better it is

18:58.996 --> 19:01.044
for them and you
in case Indians jump ya.

19:01.123 --> 19:04.502
Well, all right.
All right!

19:05.253 --> 19:09.303
Make it clear to him
that I'm wagon boss.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.884
Oh, he understands
that, Flack.

19:15.263 --> 19:17.891
He seems to be
a right pleasant cuss.

19:17.974 --> 19:21.569
He's a ruffian,
but he's a real wagon boss.

19:21.644 --> 19:23.646
Likely he is.

19:26.649 --> 19:29.152
Must've done a big trade
in wolf pelts this year.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.409
Yes, we had a big trade
with the wolfers.

19:33.990 --> 19:35.913
Flack sell you
any of these?

19:35.992 --> 19:41.419
Flack? No. He didn't do any
wolfing last winter, I guess.

19:41.497 --> 19:44.376
What outfit did you buy
the biggest bunch from?

19:44.458 --> 19:47.587
Fella name of Lopez
come in about a month ago

19:47.670 --> 19:50.344
with close on to
5,000 dollars' worth.

19:50.423 --> 19:55.179
Lopez,eh?
I guess I don't know him.

19:55.261 --> 19:58.481
I signed him up as a
bullwhacker on the train.

19:58.556 --> 20:00.604
You did, eh?

20:00.683 --> 20:02.856
I'll see you next year.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.562
Bring your scalp
along back whole.

20:04.645 --> 20:05.988
All right. Good-bye.

20:06.355 --> 20:07.356
Is that so?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.441
It certainly is.

20:08.524 --> 20:10.777
I don't know whether they're
gonna get through or not...

20:10.860 --> 20:13.079
Windy, I'm gonna scout
for that bull train.

20:13.154 --> 20:15.907
Good.

20:15.990 --> 20:17.958
Oh, Mr. Cameron,
this is Mr. Coleman.

20:18.034 --> 20:19.957
Howdy, Mr. Coleman.
How do you do, sir?

20:20.036 --> 20:22.459
Uh, he can tell you more about
that country where you're going,

20:22.538 --> 20:24.961
and what kind of an outfit you
need than any man around here.

20:25.041 --> 20:26.634
Thanks.

20:26.709 --> 20:30.179
Windy, throw my bags in with
yours and Zeke's, will ya?

20:30.254 --> 20:31.676
All right, I'll do.

20:31.756 --> 20:33.133
Tell Zeke I'm going along.

20:33.215 --> 20:34.216
All right, boy.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.723
Mr. Coleman, would you mind
looking over my outfit?

20:36.802 --> 20:40.181
Certainly not. Uh, we'll go
have a peek at it. Where is it?

20:40.264 --> 20:42.562
Right over there, sir.

20:44.268 --> 20:46.691
Honey Girl, it's time for
your history lesson, dear.

20:46.771 --> 20:50.241
Now, uh, how many stars
in the flag?

20:50.316 --> 20:51.818
Twenty-six.

20:51.901 --> 20:53.824
How many stripes?

20:53.903 --> 20:55.746
Thirty.

20:55.821 --> 20:58.950
Now, you know better than that.
There's 13.

20:59.033 --> 21:01.707
And what do they stand for?

21:01.786 --> 21:04.665
The 13 original colonies.
Now remember that.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.090
Now, who discovered
the Columbia River?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.792
Here's our outfit.

21:07.792 --> 21:10.386
Mr. Coleman, this is my sister Ruth.
Robert Gray.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.345
Honey Girl, it isn't safe to
be sitting in a rocking chair,

21:14.423 --> 21:16.972
when there are
certain persons present.

21:17.051 --> 21:20.225
I think you'll find
we have everything.

21:20.304 --> 21:21.681
Plenty of guns?

21:21.764 --> 21:25.064
A rifle and a fowling piece.

21:25.142 --> 21:26.439
How about ammunition?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.771
Plenty.

21:32.441 --> 21:34.318
One thing...
I don't see any barrel.

21:34.402 --> 21:35.403
A barrel?

21:35.486 --> 21:37.238
Yeah, you'll need
a water barrel.

21:37.321 --> 21:39.039
There'll be long
stretches without water.

21:39.115 --> 21:41.709
I knew we'd forget something.
I'll go get one.

21:41.784 --> 21:44.253
All right.

21:44.328 --> 21:47.707
What I was aiming to tell you was this.
When I came in...

21:47.790 --> 21:50.043
The folks right next
there had an extra one.

21:50.126 --> 21:52.345
Oh, quick work, son.

21:56.257 --> 21:59.261
Say, it wouldn't be a bad
idea to take two barrels.

21:59.343 --> 22:01.141
Suppose you go
rustle another one.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.972
I'll do that.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.563
When I came romping into
the Riggses' cabin, ma'am...

22:06.642 --> 22:08.736
How's this one?

22:08.811 --> 22:10.905
Oh! Well, that's fine.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.075
Looks like barrels
grow on trees around here.

22:20.489 --> 22:24.369
Mr. Cameron, you better tell your
sister to change that pretty dress.

22:24.452 --> 22:26.375
She won't get
very far in that.

22:26.454 --> 22:27.546
Yes, sir.

22:27.621 --> 22:29.623
Put on some
traveling clothes.

22:29.707 --> 22:31.175
Let's have
a peek around here.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.672
We have a trailer,

22:32.752 --> 22:34.971
in case we needed...

22:35.045 --> 22:38.015
I like him better
than Mr. Thorpe.

22:38.090 --> 22:40.843
Honey Girl, we'll finish
your history lesson.

22:41.343 --> 22:42.765
Ah, I know how that is.

22:42.845 --> 22:44.222
Well, you won't...

22:44.305 --> 22:46.228
Thorpe!

22:46.307 --> 22:50.858
<i>Thorpe, you get back on the Peensie
Bell and make yourself scarce.</i>

22:50.936 --> 22:53.530
If you're here when
the boat pulls out,

22:53.606 --> 22:57.452
the boys will certainly lead
your pony out from under you.

22:57.526 --> 23:00.951
Why, I had no
intention of staying.

23:01.030 --> 23:03.124
<i>I'll be on the Peensie Bell
when she leaves.</i>

23:03.199 --> 23:05.247
You see that you are.

23:10.998 --> 23:14.298
My goodness. I don't know what
I'm going to do with you.

23:14.376 --> 23:18.381
Well, I try again. Come on.
Here. Up you go. Up.

23:18.464 --> 23:21.138
Oh, you stubborn jackass. I
give you a "yab" in the "yaw."

23:21.217 --> 23:22.844
I bet you "yump." Come on.

23:22.927 --> 23:23.974
Up.

23:24.053 --> 23:27.353
Hello there, Gus. What do you
call that thing you got there?

23:27.431 --> 23:29.183
Oh, his name is Jack.

23:29.266 --> 23:31.815
Jack? Oh, yes.
But that's only half of it.

23:31.894 --> 23:34.488
Well, see,
he's only a half a horse.

23:34.563 --> 23:37.157
Well...What's the matter?
Can't you get him up?

23:37.233 --> 23:39.861
I don't know. I pull and I
pull, but he won't come up.

23:41.070 --> 23:42.868
Wait. Wait. I got an idea.

23:46.575 --> 23:47.792
Say, what did you
say to him then?

23:48.911 --> 23:50.959
Heh! I told him a joke
about my mother-in-law.

23:52.122 --> 23:53.248
Gus!

23:53.332 --> 23:54.424
Wait. Shh. Here she comes.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.878
Gus, what have
you got there?

23:56.961 --> 23:59.134
This is my new horse.
I just bought him.

23:59.213 --> 24:01.136
You bought him?
Sure.

24:01.215 --> 24:03.013
Say, ya...

24:07.471 --> 24:09.940
That wasn't me, Mama.
No, it was the mule.

24:13.602 --> 24:15.229
That rum's
for you and me, eh?

24:15.312 --> 24:16.438
<i>Ah, gracias.</i>

24:21.944 --> 24:23.946
Ahh.

24:26.115 --> 24:30.996
Well, if it ain't Bill Thorpe, eh?

24:31.078 --> 24:36.255
I always thought you was
hung and planted years back.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.051
No, my time ain't
arrived yet, Flack.

24:38.127 --> 24:39.174
Yeah.

24:39.253 --> 24:41.381
Though it looks as though
it might be drawing close.

24:41.463 --> 24:43.431
Ah, how come?

24:43.507 --> 24:45.509
Well, I've been
promised a hanging bee

24:45.593 --> 24:47.516
<i>if I don't get out
on the Peensie Bell.</i>

24:47.595 --> 24:51.395
And the captain promised me a necktie
party if I set foot on the boat.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.601
It's a case
of nowhere to go.

24:53.684 --> 24:57.188
Yeah. It appears to me you do
your shooting by daylight,

24:57.271 --> 25:02.152
with too many people looking on, eh?

25:02.234 --> 25:06.580
Well, long as you can't go
and you can't stay,

25:06.655 --> 25:10.285
just what do you figure
to do about it, eh?

25:10.367 --> 25:12.335
Well, I've always been
able to wiggle out.

25:12.411 --> 25:16.461
Yeah. Appears to me as if you
was born to be drowned, eh?

25:22.671 --> 25:25.049
Come on, Zeke.
Get rid of that moonshine,

25:25.132 --> 25:26.600
and let's get out
in the sunshine.

25:26.675 --> 25:28.097
All right, big boy.

25:28.177 --> 25:30.100
Hold your head up.
Don't leave me.

25:30.179 --> 25:33.149
Yeah, so long, folks.
See you next year.

25:33.223 --> 25:35.317
Yeah.

25:41.023 --> 25:45.950
Are you just as handy
with a gun as you was?

25:47.488 --> 25:49.741
I can drive
a nail at 30 paces.

25:49.823 --> 25:50.995
Yeah.

25:51.075 --> 25:54.750
Well, as long
as you can't go,

25:54.828 --> 25:59.299
and you can't stay...

25:59.375 --> 26:04.256
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you
was to go along with me.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.382
Well, that sounds reasonable.
Yeah.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.388
Where do you happen
to be headed for?

26:08.467 --> 26:11.346
Well, anyways,
it's out there,

26:11.428 --> 26:14.728
where there ain't no noose
awaitin' for you, eh?

26:16.892 --> 26:18.815
Hello, Breck.

26:18.894 --> 26:21.522
Well, Windy, I trapped
him with his jug down at Joe's.

26:21.605 --> 26:23.653
Hey, Windy, here's the last

26:23.732 --> 26:27.032
you'll see of civilization
for a long time.

26:27.111 --> 26:28.237
That's worth tryin'.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.243
Hey! Back up here,
will ya? Back up.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.326
I gotta finish
that with Windy.

26:36.245 --> 26:39.590
Hey, that's what you get
for not drinkin' with me.

26:39.665 --> 26:40.712
I'll drink at your
next wedding.

26:40.791 --> 26:41.838
Yeah!

26:41.917 --> 26:43.840
Windy, uh...

26:43.919 --> 26:46.513
Do some of them musical things,
will you, with your mouth?

26:46.588 --> 26:48.556
Ah, that's old stuff.

26:49.800 --> 26:50.847
Dab, no. Something new.

26:50.926 --> 26:51.973
Oh, well.

26:52.052 --> 26:53.019
A coyote.

26:54.179 --> 26:55.476
That's no coyote.

26:56.640 --> 26:58.688
There's the stuff! Hey!

26:58.767 --> 27:01.896
Hey, did you
ever kill a dead Indian?

27:01.979 --> 27:03.276
No, I never killed
a dead one.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.108
Before they
was dead, did ya?

27:06.191 --> 27:09.070
No. You see, the Injuns
are my friends.

27:09.153 --> 27:11.952
They taught me all I know
about the woods.

27:12.031 --> 27:15.251
They taught me how to follow a
trail by watching the leaves.

27:15.325 --> 27:16.702
And how to cut
your mark on a tree

27:16.785 --> 27:19.208
so you won't get lost
in the forest.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.382
And they taught me how
to burry in in the snow,

27:21.457 --> 27:23.630
so you won't freeze
to death in the storms.

27:24.126 --> 27:26.925
And they taught me how to make
a fire without even a flint.

27:27.004 --> 27:28.927
How could you do that?

27:29.006 --> 27:31.634
And they taught me how to make
the best bow and arrows too.

27:31.717 --> 27:34.391
Did they teach you
how to make papooses?

27:34.470 --> 27:37.269
No, that's
one of their own secrets.

27:38.307 --> 27:40.935
Well, boys, I guess
we better get going.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.029
O God, our Father,

27:52.112 --> 27:55.491
as you sit on high and look
down on us poor mortals,

27:55.574 --> 27:57.497
forgive our frailties.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.670
I am about to
lead these people

27:59.745 --> 28:02.464
into a wild and
dangerous country.

28:02.539 --> 28:07.215
Give me strength and wisdom,
0 God, to lead them through.

28:10.506 --> 28:11.723
Where's my steps?

28:11.799 --> 28:14.097
Mama, I got everything
packed up in the wagon.

28:14.176 --> 28:16.178
But how can I get
into the wagon, you idiot?

28:16.261 --> 28:18.980
Well, look, I show you. Look,
Mama, put your feets up on there.

28:19.056 --> 28:22.026
That's it. Now wait. I lift. That's...
Up you go, Mama. That's it.

28:22.101 --> 28:25.105
Now one more foot up. Now up, Mama.
Up, Mama. That's it. Up.

28:25.187 --> 28:28.066
Wait, Mama. You're sitting
on my head, Mama.

28:28.148 --> 28:30.071
Please... There you go.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.744
Get in. Get in, folks.
We're goin'.

28:32.820 --> 28:35.164
Mount up. We're goin' now.
Get in there.

28:43.080 --> 28:45.378
We're on our way.

28:45.457 --> 28:50.429
Pull out!

28:52.714 --> 28:53.715
Give us a song!

28:53.799 --> 28:54.800
All right.

28:54.883 --> 28:55.884
We're off, boys.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.470
<i>Sam's got a wooden
leg below the knee</i>

28:57.553 --> 29:00.022
<i>Sam's got a wooden leg
below the knee</i>

29:03.517 --> 29:05.565
Whoa, mule!

29:05.727 --> 29:10.528
Never mind! I
walk there, Useless. Come on.

29:15.445 --> 29:17.948
You want these sacks,
don't ya?

29:24.830 --> 29:26.832
Trade cattle.

29:52.441 --> 29:55.240
Hyah! Hyah!

30:15.047 --> 30:16.549
About time we were movin' on.

30:16.632 --> 30:18.100
Yeah.

30:21.303 --> 30:23.305
Willy!

30:24.973 --> 30:29.103
Come on, Willy. Forward!

30:53.627 --> 30:55.049
Ah, giddyap!

30:56.588 --> 31:00.718
Ah, giddyap!
Ah, giddyap!

31:06.556 --> 31:09.730
Hyah! Hyah! Move out!

31:13.063 --> 31:14.690
Yeah! Yee!

31:44.928 --> 31:49.229
You make me so tired!
Get over there!

31:49.308 --> 31:50.480
I'm tired of this!

31:50.559 --> 31:52.277
Fi!

31:52.352 --> 31:54.354
Get up here!

31:56.023 --> 31:57.946
Get along here!

31:58.025 --> 32:02.155
Get in there!
Get on! Go on!

32:08.660 --> 32:09.661
Howdy, Dave.

32:09.745 --> 32:10.871
Hello, Coleman.

32:10.954 --> 32:13.503
Oh, Miss Cameron...

32:13.582 --> 32:17.337
Glad to see you took my advice
about saving that pretty dress.

32:18.503 --> 32:22.383
You look so nice in it,
it'd be a shame to spoil it.

32:36.772 --> 32:39.321
Looking for
anyone in particular?

32:39.399 --> 32:42.448
Honey Girl,
a gentleman never comes

32:42.527 --> 32:45.280
to a lady's home
when he isn't wanted.

32:45.364 --> 32:49.619
Out here, this wagon's
our only home.

32:49.701 --> 32:52.295
Pony, that means us.

32:54.414 --> 32:56.257
Come on, Useless.
What's the matter?

32:56.333 --> 32:58.176
Come here, Useless.

32:58.251 --> 33:00.299
Hey, there.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.881
Whoa! Wait. Wait.

33:03.507 --> 33:05.054
Whoa.

33:05.133 --> 33:07.477
Get in...
Get in there.

33:09.054 --> 33:11.102
Get in there!
Giddyap!

33:11.181 --> 33:12.273
Whoa.

33:12.349 --> 33:15.853
Come on. Get in there!

33:15.936 --> 33:19.816
Come on, Useless.
This way.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.821
Git!

33:24.653 --> 33:27.076
Whoa.
Wait a minute, Useless.

33:30.784 --> 33:33.833
Come on, Useless.
Come on, Useless. Come on.

33:36.164 --> 33:39.043
What do you think
of this fella Thorpe?

33:39.126 --> 33:44.428
Ah, I've seen that there
squawker somewheres afore.

33:44.506 --> 33:46.804
Can't recollect just where.

33:46.883 --> 33:51.434
He, uh, shoots a kind of a nasty
look at you once in a while, boy.

33:51.513 --> 33:53.231
We had a run-in
the first day.

33:53.306 --> 33:54.933
Yeah?

33:55.016 --> 33:56.017
You know,
he ain't no settler.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.273
Nah.

33:57.352 --> 33:58.604
And he ain't no bullwhacker.

33:58.687 --> 33:59.813
Uh-uh.

33:59.896 --> 34:01.819
Wonder what
he come along for.

34:01.898 --> 34:06.779
Aha! He come along, uh, 'cause
of that, uh, Cameron girl.

34:06.862 --> 34:09.159
I'm still mystified,
Mr. Thorpe,

34:09.239 --> 34:13.119
why you came here instead of
returning to your plantation.

34:13.201 --> 34:15.420
I've told you why I came.

34:15.495 --> 34:18.214
I induced Captain Hollister,
an old friend of mine,

34:18.290 --> 34:21.635
to put back to shore,
and I followed you.

34:21.710 --> 34:23.632
Yes, I know that's
what you told me.

34:23.712 --> 34:25.464
But I'm afraid
you're a flatterer.

34:25.547 --> 34:28.641
Oh! On my honor, no.

34:28.717 --> 34:31.596
You got a chew of tobacco?

34:33.722 --> 34:38.944
Hey, Lopez! Tobacco's gonna
be mighty scarce later on.

34:41.313 --> 34:45.864
Boy, I'm goin' back to old Windy
Bill and get a slug of "come on."

34:47.735 --> 34:49.409
Your name's Lopez, eh?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.581
Uh, Lopez, that's me.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.623
You and Flack good friends,
he tells me.

34:53.699 --> 34:57.455
Ah, Flack and me
been friends 12, 15 years.

34:58.580 --> 35:01.003
You were out wolfing
together last winter, eh?

35:01.082 --> 35:04.882
No, no, no. Wolfing, she not
good business. No money.

35:04.961 --> 35:06.133
Then you didn't get many?

35:06.213 --> 35:08.557
No, not much.

35:08.632 --> 35:10.509
Funny. Wellmore said
you sold him

35:10.592 --> 35:12.845
more furs than any other
half dozen outfits.

35:12.928 --> 35:16.933
No. He must have been talking
about someone else. Not me.

35:17.015 --> 35:20.019
Well, no matter.
See you often.

35:22.896 --> 35:25.524
Ah, you rascal.

35:25.607 --> 35:26.608
Flack.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.206
Got a good bunch
of bullwhackers, Flack.

35:35.492 --> 35:38.086
That, uh, Lopez
strikes me as a good hand.

35:38.161 --> 35:42.132
Ah, you bet.
Lopez can pound them along.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.460
You and him old friends, eh?

35:44.543 --> 35:47.547
Who? Lopez and me?

35:47.629 --> 35:52.385
Nah. I never see'd him
till he signed on this trip.

35:52.467 --> 35:56.347
My mistake.

35:58.056 --> 36:00.058
Ah, Lopez.

36:00.141 --> 36:01.438
I don't like
this man Coleman.

36:01.518 --> 36:02.644
Yeah?

36:03.019 --> 36:07.946
If he asks after me, you
tell him you never see'd me,

36:08.024 --> 36:10.152
till you signed on this trip.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.282
You're too late.

36:11.361 --> 36:12.408
Why?

36:12.487 --> 36:16.082
He just speak to me, and I
tell him we was old friends.

36:16.157 --> 36:18.080
What?

36:18.159 --> 36:21.959
What do you use under your
hat instead of brains?

36:22.038 --> 36:25.838
You need no brains
if you got this.

36:25.917 --> 36:29.217
Ahh.
Now you're talking sense.

36:39.639 --> 36:41.858
Come on, you.
Come on. Giddyap.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.368
<i>Pick your partner
and a-promenade back.</i>

36:55.196 --> 36:58.040
<i>First couple out to the right
and follow the ca...</i>

37:08.877 --> 37:11.255
Prepare to promenade back.

37:14.716 --> 37:17.219
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

37:31.566 --> 37:33.944
Now right in circles.

37:41.451 --> 37:44.751
Take your partner
and a-promenade back.

37:47.582 --> 37:49.835
First couple out to the right
and follow the call.

37:49.918 --> 37:53.047
Maybe she won't, uh,
talk with him,

37:53.129 --> 37:56.224
but she'll dance
with him, eh?

37:57.425 --> 37:58.972
It's a lovely dance.

37:59.052 --> 38:00.554
On with the next
and follow the call.

38:00.637 --> 38:03.015
And a lovely night.

38:03.098 --> 38:05.226
And a lovely girl.

38:05.308 --> 38:09.609
Now's your chance. Go in and
snag her away from him.

38:17.237 --> 38:18.534
I claim the favor.

38:18.613 --> 38:20.957
With pleasure, Mr. Thorpe.

38:27.497 --> 38:28.544
Well, Zeke.

38:28.623 --> 38:29.670
Hello, boy.

38:29.749 --> 38:32.628
Thorpe just stole my partner and
left me dancing with myself.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.054
Yeah?

38:34.295 --> 38:37.424
Say, boy, it just come to me
a minute ago,

38:37.507 --> 38:39.225
where I seen that
there Thorpe before.

38:39.300 --> 38:40.301
Where?

38:40.385 --> 38:44.356
Camped on the Cimarron with
Flack and Lopez. They're old friends.

38:44.431 --> 38:46.183
Are you sure of that?
Dead certain.

38:46.266 --> 38:49.361
So keep your eye
peeled on him, son.

38:49.436 --> 38:53.532
Oh, I'm tired. I think
I'll go to my wagon.

38:53.606 --> 38:56.701
Why, certainly.
Let me take you there.

39:02.323 --> 39:04.576
And to think this
same moon is shining

39:04.659 --> 39:07.378
on my old plantation
in Louisiana.

39:20.008 --> 39:23.387
All it needs is a lovely
woman to preside there.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.268
Someday you'll find her.

39:25.346 --> 39:27.064
I have found her, Ruth.

39:27.140 --> 39:29.734
Oh, please, Mr. Thorpe.
Look, I've told you before

39:29.809 --> 39:32.608
that there can be
no happiness without love.

39:32.687 --> 39:34.610
But love will come.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.213
Ruth... I'm really
tired, Mr. Thorpe.

39:54.292 --> 39:57.717
Do you mind if I go to bed?
Good night.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.389
Good night.

40:22.570 --> 40:25.289
We're getting into
dangerous country, Flack...

40:25.365 --> 40:28.665
So I'll be riding to the Pawnee
villages to pick up some Injun scouts.

40:28.743 --> 40:33.499
Yes? Well, you're likely to
lose your scalp out there.

40:33.581 --> 40:37.336
I'll bet you a couple of wolf
pelts I bring it back with me.

40:40.421 --> 40:43.095
How long'll you
be gone, Coleman?

40:43.174 --> 40:45.222
Three or four days,
a week maybe.

40:45.301 --> 40:47.303
Oh, back so soon?

40:47.387 --> 40:49.685
I thought maybe you wouldn't
be coming back at all.

40:49.764 --> 40:52.108
And just why did
you think that?

40:54.143 --> 40:59.866
Well, after I sort of took the
dark-eyed beauty away from you,

40:59.941 --> 41:02.319
I thought you
might be decamping.

41:05.488 --> 41:10.369
Listen, Thorpe. I never quit a
job in the middle of the road.

41:10.451 --> 41:12.795
Oh, quite so.
Quite so.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.294
But after the girl quit you
in the middle of the road...

41:15.373 --> 41:17.626
Say that again, Mr. Thorpe!

41:21.129 --> 41:23.757
I know who you are now,

41:23.840 --> 41:26.684
and I know why you quit
the Cimarron country too.

41:28.344 --> 41:31.518
Oh, well. No necessity to
have quarrels among friends.

41:31.598 --> 41:36.274
Friends?
You threw too wide a loop.

41:36.352 --> 41:40.482
Remember this,
the three of you...

41:40.565 --> 41:42.988
I'm not your friend.

41:50.533 --> 41:55.414
Yeah. Well, you let him
scare you stiff.

41:55.496 --> 41:57.419
Not at all.

41:57.498 --> 41:59.876
Only an idiot, you know,
presses a quarrel,

41:59.959 --> 42:02.633
when the other man has a knife
pressed against his middle.

42:02.712 --> 42:05.090
Yeah. Good excuse.

42:05.173 --> 42:07.892
Wolf pelts, eh?

42:07.967 --> 42:08.968
What does that mean?

42:09.052 --> 42:10.224
Don't mean nothin'.

42:10.303 --> 42:12.647
It doesn't to me,
but it does to you.

42:12.722 --> 42:14.770
Yeah? Where'd you get
that notion?

42:14.849 --> 42:16.146
When he mentioned
wolf pelts, you looked

42:16.225 --> 42:18.319
as though he'd rammed
a knife in you.

42:18.394 --> 42:21.364
Not exactly
what I'd call a poker face.

42:21.439 --> 42:24.659
Yeah?
Well, what of it?

42:24.734 --> 42:27.157
Oh, nothing.

42:27.236 --> 42:31.787
Only I'm beginning to understand
why you don't like Coleman.

42:35.703 --> 42:37.626
Bye, Windy.

42:37.705 --> 42:40.959
And, Zeke, I'll be seeing you in the
happy hunting grounds if not before.

42:41.042 --> 42:42.168
Good luck, boy.

42:42.251 --> 42:43.377
Bye.

42:44.879 --> 42:48.554
Well, Miss Ruth, I got
some good news for you.

42:48.633 --> 42:49.850
What?

42:49.926 --> 42:53.476
I'm gonna be away for a while.
I'm going scoutin'.

42:53.554 --> 42:56.558
Well, isn't that dangerous
in the open country?

42:56.641 --> 42:59.360
Lord, no. I love it...

42:59.435 --> 43:04.032
Especially now that it's spring
and everything's so happy.

43:04.107 --> 43:08.328
Why, there's trees
out there, big, tall pines...

43:08.403 --> 43:10.576
Just a-reachin'
and a-reachin'...

43:10.655 --> 43:13.204
As if they wanted to climb right
through the gates of heaven.

43:13.908 --> 43:19.165
And there's brooks, too, with
the water smiling all day long.

43:19.247 --> 43:22.501
But the part I like best
is the night...

43:22.583 --> 43:25.837
Lying out there beneath
a blanket of stars,

43:25.920 --> 43:29.424
with that old moon
smiling down on you.

43:29.507 --> 43:33.182
And every time you look up,
there she is,

43:33.261 --> 43:37.858
sort of guarding over you, like
a mother minding her young.

43:39.642 --> 43:44.819
Sometimes it's so beautiful that
I just lie there, listening.

43:44.897 --> 43:49.653
Birds singing,
brooks laughing,

43:49.736 --> 43:53.206
and the wind sort of
crooning through the forest.

43:53.281 --> 43:56.581
Like some great organ.

43:56.659 --> 43:58.878
Oh, I've always loved it.

44:01.122 --> 44:03.716
But I reckon I'm gonna be
lonely this time.

44:05.793 --> 44:10.469
You know, you can get sort of used
to having somebody not like you.

44:12.133 --> 44:17.014
And when they're not around,
you miss them not liking you.

44:17.930 --> 44:21.560
That's why I reckon
I'm gonna be lonesome.

44:22.602 --> 44:25.401
But I'll be thinking of you.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.482
Good-bye.

44:31.152 --> 44:34.247
And you just take care
you don't lose your scalp!

44:34.322 --> 44:36.245
Zeke, is he leaving
the train?

44:36.324 --> 44:38.418
Yes, miss. He's riding out
to Pawnee villages.

44:38.493 --> 44:39.836
Well, how far are they?

44:39.911 --> 44:42.209
Oh, nigh on a hundred mile.

44:42.622 --> 44:43.965
Well, isn't that dangerous?

44:44.040 --> 44:47.715
Well, he's likely to lose his
scalp afore he gets there.

44:47.794 --> 44:49.967
But once in the villages,
he's safe.

44:50.046 --> 44:52.299
So don't you
worry about him, miss.

44:52.381 --> 44:54.884
What... Why should
I worry about him?

44:54.967 --> 44:57.311
I don't know, miss.
I don't know.

44:57.595 --> 44:59.939
But seemed like as
if maybe you was.

45:00.014 --> 45:01.891
Oh, not at all.
He means nothing to me.

45:01.974 --> 45:05.854
No. No, in course not.
Good night.

45:06.562 --> 45:08.360
Good night, Zeke.

45:20.868 --> 45:23.621
Hey! You got back
here at last, eh?

45:23.704 --> 45:27.129
Yeah. There's plenty of
buffalo sign out here,

45:27.208 --> 45:29.427
so I'll be riding out
to pick up fresh meat.

45:29.502 --> 45:31.675
Ah, well, who's keeping you?

45:31.754 --> 45:33.802
I'll see you at
the river crossing.

45:39.303 --> 45:44.230
Lopez! Lopez! Thorpe!
Pull up here. Come here.

45:46.769 --> 45:50.649
You two have been waiting
for your chance. Here it is.

45:50.731 --> 45:52.483
Go out on a buffalo hunt.

45:52.567 --> 45:54.285
Me? Nah.

45:54.360 --> 45:57.330
I kill hundreds of buffalo.
Why should I go?

45:57.405 --> 45:59.658
Ah! Get them cobwebs
out of your brain!

45:59.740 --> 46:03.085
He means, Lopez,
we might find better game.

46:14.005 --> 46:17.225
Watch him till
he leaves the Pawnees,

46:17.300 --> 46:19.769
and then give it
to him in the back.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.846
Go on.

47:54.230 --> 47:58.406
Hey, you pilgrims!
Come here! Come here!

47:58.693 --> 48:00.366
Bascom?
Yes!

48:00.444 --> 48:01.946
Bascom!
Yes.

48:02.029 --> 48:05.909
I'll shove the horses and
the cattle right on through.

48:05.992 --> 48:08.620
Leave only the wheelers
hooked to the wagons.

48:08.703 --> 48:10.797
Once you take to the water...

48:10.871 --> 48:15.672
Well, it's every man and critter
for hisself, eh?

48:15.751 --> 48:17.469
Get out of here!
Get out of here! Go on!

48:17.545 --> 48:18.717
Mr. Flack.

48:18.796 --> 48:22.300
Mr. Flack, how can I get
my mule Useless across?

48:22.383 --> 48:26.058
Well, uh, get your
mother-in-law to ride him, eh?

48:26.137 --> 48:27.980
Mr. Bascom.
Yes?

48:28.055 --> 48:29.853
Mr. Bascom, you know,
I don't like that fella.

48:29.932 --> 48:30.979
No?

48:31.058 --> 48:33.527
He's the kind who will pat you
on your back to your face,

48:33.602 --> 48:35.275
and then laughs in your face
behind your back.

48:35.354 --> 48:36.321
Yeah.

48:36.397 --> 48:37.614
And another thing.
Yes?

48:37.690 --> 48:41.411
If he had a mother-in-law like
mine, he would never laugh.

48:48.743 --> 48:51.337
The hunt was a great success.

48:51.412 --> 48:52.629
We bagged our buffalo.

48:52.705 --> 48:54.503
Hey.

48:54.582 --> 48:57.506
Did you get your meat, eh?

48:59.795 --> 49:02.674
Ah, good. Good!

49:02.757 --> 49:05.055
Well, we'd better
shove on off then.

51:30.070 --> 51:32.164
Boots off.

51:37.161 --> 51:39.334
I see you took a bath.

51:39.413 --> 51:42.337
Uh, yeah, yeah.

51:42.416 --> 51:45.260
Is there... ls there
a slug of whiskey?

51:45.336 --> 51:49.682
No, I left my jug... I hid
it in the Camerons' wagon.

51:49.757 --> 51:51.680
By the way,
where is my little beauty?

51:51.759 --> 51:55.138
Well, she's, uh...
She's somewheres around.

51:55.221 --> 51:58.646
Well, now that you've
got her all to yourself,

51:58.724 --> 52:00.647
what do you aim
to do with her?

52:00.726 --> 52:03.900
I think I'll take her back
and settle on my plantation.

52:03.979 --> 52:08.530
Your... Your plantation, eh?

52:09.109 --> 52:14.741
Lopez, he's hollered so much about
that there plantation of his,

52:14.823 --> 52:17.702
he believes it hisself, eh?

52:17.785 --> 52:20.834
<i>What? The Señor Thorpe,
he have no plantation?</i>

52:20.913 --> 52:22.915
Plantation! Ha!

52:23.207 --> 52:27.132
All you got in the world
is a dirty deck of cards

52:27.586 --> 52:29.213
and a crooked one at that.

52:29.296 --> 52:30.548
Zeke.
Yeah?

52:30.631 --> 52:32.429
Coleman's been gone two days.

52:32.508 --> 52:35.011
Yeah. I've been kinda
worried about that myself.

52:44.645 --> 52:48.525
Eagle Tail says last time he seen
him, he was headed for the train.

52:48.607 --> 52:51.736
Well, another thing, the
Camerons haven't crossed yet.

52:51.819 --> 52:53.913
No. I better
saunter on down there

52:53.988 --> 52:55.240
and see what's
holdin' 'em, huh?

52:55.322 --> 52:57.416
Yes. We'd better
help 'em across.

52:57.491 --> 52:59.164
Yeah. Go on.

53:03.872 --> 53:05.966
Well, I think we can...

53:06.041 --> 53:08.294
We were just wondering
what had become of you.

53:08.377 --> 53:09.845
Where's your horse?

53:09.920 --> 53:13.345
He stepped in a prairie-dog
hole and broke his neck.

53:13.424 --> 53:14.676
Come near
breakin' mine too.

53:14.758 --> 53:15.975
Are you hurt?

53:16.051 --> 53:19.100
No. I was knocked out
for a spell.

53:19.179 --> 53:22.479
Here, I'll put these in your
wagon and help you across.

53:22.558 --> 53:25.186
Flack said we could
only use the wheelers.

53:25.269 --> 53:27.863
Flack said? What does
he know about water?

53:27.938 --> 53:30.361
He never took
a bath in his life.

53:37.489 --> 53:39.833
Shortie!

53:42.745 --> 53:45.419
There's the Cameron wagon.

53:51.337 --> 53:53.305
I'll go greet
the little filly.

53:53.380 --> 53:55.303
Greet, eh?

53:55.382 --> 54:00.058
Well, Lopez and me
will go greet a jug.

54:01.764 --> 54:04.734
Whoa!

54:04.808 --> 54:07.436
You take 'em from here on in, Dave.
It's shallow water.

54:07.519 --> 54:09.271
All right, Breck. I'll go
back and get my saddle.

54:09.355 --> 54:11.357
All right.

54:13.901 --> 54:16.279
Giddyap!
Come on, Shortie!

54:17.821 --> 54:19.823
Come on!

54:21.617 --> 54:25.463
Come on, Shortie!
Come on! Get up there!

54:25.537 --> 54:27.335
Whoa! Whoa!

54:28.415 --> 54:30.338
I was just coming over to help you.

54:30.417 --> 54:32.511
Thank you.
We had the best of help.

54:32.586 --> 54:34.588
Help? Who?

54:39.259 --> 54:41.682
What's the matter, Lopez?
Seein' a few ghosts?

54:41.762 --> 54:43.685
Me? No, no.

54:49.436 --> 54:51.359
Drive on into
the corral, Dave.

54:51.438 --> 54:52.530
All right.

54:52.606 --> 54:55.485
Giddyap! Come on there!
Get up there!

54:55.567 --> 54:57.569
Pull on up!

55:00.239 --> 55:03.914
I'll be seeing you three later
about matters and things.

55:16.547 --> 55:17.844
Why, hello, boy.

55:17.923 --> 55:19.175
Howdy, Zeke.

55:19.258 --> 55:20.475
Why, what happened?

55:20.551 --> 55:22.269
Pony stepped in a dog hole.

55:22.344 --> 55:25.894
Yeah? I suppose a prairie dog shot
that hole through your saddle

55:25.973 --> 55:28.271
and into your horse, eh?

55:28.350 --> 55:30.352
Natchie!

55:40.320 --> 55:43.039
Who was gone
from camp, Zeke?

55:43.115 --> 55:45.743
Thorpe and Lopez
come in during the night,

55:45.826 --> 55:49.296
and early morning, sent a
wagon out for the meat.

55:53.167 --> 55:57.468
Well, a nice
mess you made of things.

55:57.546 --> 55:59.548
Not at all!

56:00.591 --> 56:04.095
Two hundred yards running is
considerable of a handicap.

56:04.178 --> 56:07.182
Besides,
other days are coming.

56:07.264 --> 56:09.642
Well, don't you
fool yourself.

56:09.725 --> 56:11.853
Here he is, here
he is, here he is.

56:13.687 --> 56:16.190
Flack, the Injuns
been sending up

56:16.273 --> 56:17.775
smoke signals
for several days.

56:17.858 --> 56:19.952
Yes, well, I seen 'em.

56:20.027 --> 56:22.951
I'll skirmish around with the
Pawnees for a few miles.

56:23.030 --> 56:25.704
Well, go on. There ain't
no one keeping you!

56:25.783 --> 56:28.878
No, but you'd better keep
Thorpe and Lopez here.

56:28.952 --> 56:30.875
Why?

56:30.954 --> 56:34.709
I got a feeling that if either
one of 'em leaves camp,

56:35.709 --> 56:37.632
they'll never come back.

56:37.711 --> 56:39.634
What do you mean by that?

56:39.713 --> 56:41.465
Just the way it sounded.

56:41.548 --> 56:43.801
Hey, look there.
Look there, eh?

56:47.221 --> 56:48.393
Injuns?

56:54.061 --> 56:57.907
Lopez, fire
a long shot at 'em.

56:57.981 --> 56:59.733
No fire!

57:02.986 --> 57:05.330
They're Cheyennes.
They want to palaver.

57:05.405 --> 57:08.079
Ah, they look to me
as if they're out for harm.

57:08.158 --> 57:10.707
They will be if
we take a shot at 'em.

57:10.786 --> 57:13.790
That'll mean war. I'll go
out and palaver with them.

57:13.872 --> 57:17.877
Go on. Go on. Maybe
so you no come back, huh?

57:20.045 --> 57:21.797
Look how queerly
his horse is acting.

57:21.880 --> 57:23.598
Yeah. He's riding zigzag.

57:23.674 --> 57:26.848
That's Indian sign
that he wants to palaver.

57:30.806 --> 57:34.151
There's the chief riding out
to meet him now for a powwow.

58:05.507 --> 58:08.056
Zeke! Bascom!

58:17.853 --> 58:19.855
How.

58:21.648 --> 58:24.197
This is Black Elk,
an old friend of mine.

58:24.276 --> 58:27.075
Do they mean peace or war?

58:27.154 --> 58:29.703
Peace, if as long as we march
straight through the Cheyenne country

58:29.781 --> 58:31.829
without stopping to settle.

59:01.772 --> 59:03.945
Now that we're gonna be friends,

59:04.024 --> 59:06.743
they'll probably bring their
families over here to beg.

59:06.818 --> 59:09.617
So feed 'em well and treat 'em
right, and we'll have no trouble.

59:09.696 --> 59:10.788
All right.

59:10.864 --> 59:12.332
All right. Fine.

59:13.825 --> 59:14.872
No more
trouble now.

59:31.176 --> 59:34.931
Yes. Yes. Yes.

59:35.013 --> 59:37.015
Zeke, what's he
saying about me?

59:37.099 --> 59:40.353
He says that Coleman wants you
for his squaw.

59:42.312 --> 59:43.313
Yes.

59:44.564 --> 59:48.410
Yes. And he says Flack
or Thorpe will get you.

59:48.485 --> 59:50.408
Flack or Thorpe? Why?
Yeah.

59:50.487 --> 59:51.830
Well, Flack's got
a lot of horses.

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.183
Miss Ruth,
you shouldn't be riding out

01:00:15.262 --> 01:00:17.185
here alone like this
away from the train.

01:00:17.264 --> 01:00:18.811
Why not?

01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:22.360
Because this is dangerous country
and anything might happen.

01:00:22.769 --> 01:00:24.567
You wouldn't care.

01:00:24.646 --> 01:00:26.398
Care? Me?

01:00:26.481 --> 01:00:28.404
Why should you care?

01:00:28.483 --> 01:00:31.077
Listen, girl,
if anything happened to you,

01:00:31.153 --> 01:00:33.155
it'd be like throwing
my heart to the wol...

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:35.787
Oh, what...

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:39.996
Don't worry. It's Black Elk
and some of his braves.

01:00:43.623 --> 01:00:46.092
Coleman squaw.
Coleman squaw.

01:00:46.168 --> 01:00:48.717
Well, he's saying
that I'm your squaw.

01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:50.718
Seems like that's
what he's driving at.

01:00:50.797 --> 01:00:53.300
Well, you tell him that you
don't want me for your squaw.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.727
I've never told
Black Elk a lie yet.

01:00:55.802 --> 01:00:57.770
He knows my
tongue is straight.

01:00:57.846 --> 01:00:59.769
Well, what do you mean?

01:00:59.848 --> 01:01:02.897
Well, it wouldn't be true if I
told him I didn't want you.

01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:05.070
It happens I do.

01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:06.738
And you've
no better taste than

01:01:06.813 --> 01:01:09.407
to tell me that
before all these savages?

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:12.487
I'd tell you that
in front of the whole world.

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:15.413
This silly joke
has gone far enough.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.944
Hey! Well,
there's one down anyway.

01:01:50.023 --> 01:01:52.776
Well, there's some more out there.
Let's go get 'em.

01:01:52.859 --> 01:01:54.827
All right, here we go.

01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:00.033
Here she goes!

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:01.744
That's it.
That's it.

01:02:01.827 --> 01:02:03.374
Another one.

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.957
Get over there. Hey.

01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:25.433
Hey, there. Go on.

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:33.404
Yeah. Hope we land
in no trouble up ahead.

01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:10.524
Help those...
Help them take this stuff,

01:03:10.604 --> 01:03:12.777
the ones that are
going down.

01:03:23.992 --> 01:03:25.414
All right.
Hold tight.

01:03:25.493 --> 01:03:27.461
All right.

01:03:29.289 --> 01:03:31.383
Ah, you should be fine.

01:03:31.458 --> 01:03:33.460
Hang on, boy.

01:03:38.757 --> 01:03:41.260
You take Honey Girl
from here on down, Dave.

01:03:41.343 --> 01:03:42.560
It's a little easier going.

01:03:42.636 --> 01:03:44.604
Hold on.
All right, Breck.

01:03:44.679 --> 01:03:45.680
Careful of her, Davey.

01:03:45.764 --> 01:03:47.937
Now, Miss Ruth,
you cling on to me.

01:03:48.016 --> 01:03:49.359
Put your arms around
my neck, Honey Girl.

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:53.280
A little tighter.

01:03:55.774 --> 01:03:57.776
Just a little tighter.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:19.966
Let him down.
Come on, men.

01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:25.849
Hurry up

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:28.102
Hang on.
Let's take some in pairs.

01:04:43.405 --> 01:04:45.874
Are you all right, Honey Girl?

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:49.456
It was a pretty bad place,
wasn't it, Breck?

01:04:49.536 --> 01:04:52.881
Yeah, but I sort of
liked it.

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.175
Davey, let's see if our wagon's down yet.
Come on, Honey Girl.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.252
Thank you, Breck.

01:04:59.254 --> 01:05:03.100
Well, well, well, well!

01:05:03.174 --> 01:05:05.051
So I've seen
that gal with her arms

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:07.979
around your neck at last.

01:05:08.054 --> 01:05:11.433
Yeah, but she sure unwrapped them
when she got on safe footin'.

01:05:11.516 --> 01:05:13.439
Yeah.

01:05:13.518 --> 01:05:16.146
You know, she don't care
nothin' about me, Zeke.

01:05:16.229 --> 01:05:20.655
Well, you can never tell how a
woman feels by the way she acts.

01:05:20.734 --> 01:05:24.705
They's all riddles, all of 'em,
and you just gotta guess 'em.

01:05:24.779 --> 01:05:27.658
And no matter which way
you guess, you're wrong.

01:05:30.243 --> 01:05:32.245
Looks like as if the way
they're puttin'

01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:33.876
some of them outfits
over there,

01:05:33.955 --> 01:05:35.957
they're a-gonna lose 'em.

01:05:36.041 --> 01:05:38.169
Hold it!

01:05:39.919 --> 01:05:42.547
Ha-ha! What did I tell you?

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.258
Let's get out of here afore
they get a bead on us.

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.097
Hold it!

01:05:55.268 --> 01:05:57.191
Zeke, did you hear
that terrible crash?

01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:59.193
Hear it? I seen it.

01:05:59.272 --> 01:06:01.366
You did?
That was your wagon!

01:06:01.441 --> 01:06:03.159
Oh. Was my
mother-in-law in it?

01:06:03.234 --> 01:06:04.406
No, she wasn't.

01:06:04.486 --> 01:06:05.783
Oh, that's too bad.

01:06:05.862 --> 01:06:07.079
What'd you say?

01:06:07.155 --> 01:06:09.374
I said, "I am glad."

01:06:09.449 --> 01:06:11.872
Lucky for you that I wasn't,
you loafing hound.

01:06:11.951 --> 01:06:13.248
What you mean?

01:06:13.328 --> 01:06:16.377
Because I was with your wife,
Sarah, and she gave birth to twins.

01:06:16.456 --> 01:06:17.673
Twins? Are they both mine?

01:06:17.749 --> 01:06:18.716
Both.

01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:20.544
Oh, Mama,
are they boys or girls?

01:06:20.627 --> 01:06:21.674
One of each!

01:06:21.753 --> 01:06:24.882
Oh, Zeke, I am a papa.
 Mama, I am a papa.

01:06:24.964 --> 01:06:26.887
Papa, lam a mama.
Yeah.

01:06:26.966 --> 01:06:28.468
I got two for one.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.349
Yeah. Let's drink
to the happy event.

01:06:30.428 --> 01:06:33.056
Wait a minute. There was two events.
I have two drinks.

01:06:33.139 --> 01:06:36.393
Here, give me that jug. I'll
take a pull at that myself.

01:06:45.693 --> 01:06:48.037
Three more.

01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:51.538
Hyah! Giddyap!

01:07:15.723 --> 01:07:17.851
Whoa!

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:28.077
Well, who'd have guessed it?

01:07:28.153 --> 01:07:29.621
If it ain't Breck Coleman.

01:07:29.696 --> 01:07:30.743
Howdy, Jim.

01:07:30.822 --> 01:07:32.369
Where'd you
blow in from, boy?

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:33.951
All the way from
the big river.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.082
Flack.

01:07:37.162 --> 01:07:39.085
How long are we
gonna camp here?

01:07:39.164 --> 01:07:42.964
Well, just as long as it
takes to fix up the outfit.

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:46.216
Bascom, you tell them
pilgrims of yours,

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:49.971
there's 500 miles
of desert ahead of us

01:07:50.049 --> 01:07:52.643
and them that don't like
what's comin' to them,

01:07:52.719 --> 01:07:56.189
now's the time for
'em to turn back.

01:08:18.786 --> 01:08:22.131
Yes, sir, that pork
is nearly done right now.

01:08:40.099 --> 01:08:42.898
Shank me off a snack!

01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:46.023
Get out of there.

01:08:46.104 --> 01:08:47.823
Fine piece of beef.

01:08:47.899 --> 01:08:50.823
Ah!

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:55.327
Fetch it on over here.

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:02.290
I hate to see you
at menial tasks.

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:06.877
If we were only back at my
old plantation in Louisiana,

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.759
you'd have a dozen servants
to wait on you.

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:15.060
Let's turn back.

01:09:15.134 --> 01:09:19.139
Turn back, Mr. Thorpe?
Why... Oh. Why, I...

01:09:19.639 --> 01:09:21.812
Oh, Honey Girl, didn't I tell
you to stay away from the fire?

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.064
Yes. And you told me not to
be sitting in a rocking chair

01:09:24.143 --> 01:09:26.316
when Breck Coleman
was around.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:27.526
Hello, Coleman.

01:09:27.604 --> 01:09:28.982
Howdy, Dave.

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:34.658
You shot these turkeys. Won't
you stay and help us eat them?

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:38.742
No. Uh, I just had supper
with the Bascoms.

01:09:38.825 --> 01:09:40.747
Sorry, Breck.

01:09:40.827 --> 01:09:43.330
Think I'll go
hunt up old Zeke.

01:09:47.584 --> 01:09:50.303
How many's that
for you, Windy?

01:09:50.377 --> 01:09:52.721
Number 84.

01:09:52.796 --> 01:09:54.720
Well, here comes 85.

01:09:54.799 --> 01:09:56.426
Hello, Zeke. Windy.

01:09:56.509 --> 01:09:58.056
Hello, boy.

01:09:58.136 --> 01:10:00.389
I smell turkey a-cookin'.

01:10:00.471 --> 01:10:03.771
That's all I got was a smell.

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:06.603
Deal me a hand
of them flapjacks.

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:08.688
That's the way
it's done, Gussie.

01:10:08.771 --> 01:10:11.991
My old arm's giving out. Now you try it.
I'll get a pail of water.

01:10:12.066 --> 01:10:14.034
That's easy.
I can do that.

01:10:15.528 --> 01:10:18.532
See, I've saw Zeke do that
till he broke his arm.

01:10:18.615 --> 01:10:22.165
Yes. And you know, someday my
mother-in-law's gonna talk so much,

01:10:22.243 --> 01:10:23.916
she's going to break
her "yaw."

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:29.551
Say, boy, I wouldn't let my
mother-in-law boss me around like that.

01:10:29.626 --> 01:10:32.880
Stand up to her like a man.
Face her down, boy.

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:36.808
Huh. If it was me, I'd tell
her what was on my chest.

01:10:36.883 --> 01:10:39.477
You got nothing
on your chest but wind!

01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:43.644
You old polecat.

01:10:46.017 --> 01:10:48.065
I've just been
talking with some trappers

01:10:48.144 --> 01:10:50.146
who've come out
of the Southwest.

01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:54.575
They say the country they
call California is wonderful.

01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:56.653
Yes, so I've heard.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:00.623
Why won't you come with me
to a land like that?

01:11:00.698 --> 01:11:02.621
Are you going there?

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.577
If you'll come with me.

01:11:04.661 --> 01:11:07.084
Well, what about
your plantation in Louisiana?

01:11:08.665 --> 01:11:11.589
Oh. Well...

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:14.137
If we like
California better,

01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:17.842
we could sell my holdings and
buy vast lands out there.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.308
Well, it's...
It's a compliment

01:11:23.388 --> 01:11:26.392
to offer me all that,
but it can't be.

01:11:26.474 --> 01:11:28.727
I must join Davey.

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:34.490
Oh, Dave.
Dave, come over here.

01:11:34.565 --> 01:11:38.695
Black Elk here says that you and
your sister were so good to him,

01:11:38.778 --> 01:11:42.453
when he come in to visit that he
wants to give you all them ponies.

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:44.708
Well, that's kind
of him, Zeke,

01:11:44.784 --> 01:11:46.536
but we couldn't
take their horses.

01:11:46.619 --> 01:11:49.748
Oh, of course you could.
They got hundreds of ponies.

01:11:55.461 --> 01:11:57.884
He wants you to show him
where to put 'em.

01:11:57.964 --> 01:12:01.138
You go and throw them ponies
in with your herd.

01:12:03.344 --> 01:12:05.517
Why, Zeke, you lyin' old coot.

01:12:05.596 --> 01:12:09.692
That Injun's buying Cameron's
sister for Coleman's squaw.

01:12:12.478 --> 01:12:16.073
Well... Well...
Well, why not?

01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:19.278
So Coleman's
buying himself a squaw, eh?

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.113
Zeke, you old
whiskered Cupid, you!

01:12:28.119 --> 01:12:30.747
I loathe
the very sight of you!

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:32.047
What have I done now?

01:12:32.123 --> 01:12:33.921
You've made me
the joke of the plains.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.047
Me?

01:12:35.126 --> 01:12:38.676
Who else tried to buy me
like an Indian squaw?

01:12:38.755 --> 01:12:40.883
You put me to shame
before them all.

01:12:40.965 --> 01:12:43.093
Why, girl,
you're imagining things.

01:12:43.176 --> 01:12:45.349
Oh... Ohh! Ohh!

01:12:49.849 --> 01:12:53.444
Zeke always told me
women were damned funny.

01:12:53.519 --> 01:12:56.272
Mr. Thorpe,
I've changed my mind.

01:12:56.355 --> 01:12:59.199
I'll go with you to California
if you'll go at once.

01:12:59.275 --> 01:13:03.075
At once?
Why, yes, yes.

01:13:03.154 --> 01:13:06.704
Uh, I'll make
preparations immediately.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.328
This is a fine
state of affairs.

01:13:10.411 --> 01:13:13.085
This man Thorpe isn't
all he claims to be.

01:13:13.164 --> 01:13:16.668
My mind is made up, Davey, and
we're going to California.

01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:20.430
Where's Flack?

01:13:28.346 --> 01:13:29.689
Hey!

01:13:34.602 --> 01:13:36.525
I just came in to
tell you good-bye.

01:13:36.604 --> 01:13:40.404
Uh, good-bye?
Where are you going?

01:13:40.483 --> 01:13:43.077
I'm going to take my outfit
and leave you here.

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:48.283
Uh, your outfit? All you got
is one horse and two guns.

01:13:48.366 --> 01:13:51.370
No, the Cameron
outfit's mine now.

01:13:51.452 --> 01:13:53.204
Oh, it is, eh?

01:13:53.871 --> 01:13:56.124
Yes, we're going
to California,

01:13:56.207 --> 01:13:58.676
so I'll bid you
a fond farewell.

01:13:58.751 --> 01:13:59.798
No, you ain't!

01:14:00.336 --> 01:14:02.054
No?
Nah!

01:14:02.129 --> 01:14:06.430
Why do you suppose
I grubstaked you for, eh?

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:09.388
So far, you've
been a fizzle.

01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:11.973
One try, one miss.

01:14:12.056 --> 01:14:13.524
Oh, he's no longer
in my way.

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:15.021
Well, he's in mine.

01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:16.853
Well, tear him
down yourself.

01:14:16.936 --> 01:14:20.440
Oh, I'd like to
kick him into pulp.

01:14:20.523 --> 01:14:23.367
Oh, I'd like to
break him in two like a...

01:14:23.442 --> 01:14:24.864
Well, why not?

01:14:26.362 --> 01:14:32.085
I don't mind fists or feet,
or even a gun.

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:35.914
It's the way
he throws that knife.

01:14:35.997 --> 01:14:37.374
But why should I risk it?

01:14:37.456 --> 01:14:41.302
Because you're a dead shot.

01:14:41.794 --> 01:14:45.014
You're a-going to stick.

01:14:45.089 --> 01:14:49.435
You're a-going to prove
how good you are,

01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:50.727
before you leave the fort.

01:14:50.803 --> 01:14:52.020
And if I don't?

01:14:52.096 --> 01:14:54.098
Well, if you don't...

01:14:54.557 --> 01:14:56.901
I'll tell that little filly

01:14:56.976 --> 01:15:01.573
there's a wide-open noose
waitin' for you

01:15:01.647 --> 01:15:04.196
in every river town.

01:15:04.275 --> 01:15:10.248
Thorpe, you do your
job before you leave the fort.

01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:32.137
Howdy, Henry.

01:15:32.219 --> 01:15:33.937
How's things, Coleman?
Just fine.

01:15:34.013 --> 01:15:36.766
Say,
Black Elk was telling me

01:15:36.849 --> 01:15:37.975
that all the Injuns
in the West

01:15:38.059 --> 01:15:40.983
was gathering to keep you
all from passin' through.

01:15:41.062 --> 01:15:43.531
So they tell me.

01:15:43.606 --> 01:15:45.984
Black Elk and the Cheyennes
are going west

01:15:46.067 --> 01:15:48.695
to hold a powwow
with the Shoshones.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:50.951
Yeah, Black Elk tells me
that it's almost certain

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:53.533
that the Cheyennes
will declare war later.

01:15:53.616 --> 01:15:54.663
Likely.

01:15:54.742 --> 01:15:57.291
Old Pete Rubideaux was asking
about you a while ago.

01:15:57.370 --> 01:15:58.792
Pete? Where is he?

01:15:58.871 --> 01:16:01.624
Camped at the spring yonder
with his new squaw.

01:16:01.707 --> 01:16:03.300
I think I'll ramble
down and see him.

01:16:03.376 --> 01:16:04.548
Sure.

01:16:04.627 --> 01:16:07.176
Say, Henry, will you put a
new cap nipple on this gun?

01:16:07.254 --> 01:16:09.222
Sure will, boy.

01:16:09.298 --> 01:16:11.847
And a new trigger
spring in the pistol.

01:16:11.926 --> 01:16:12.973
All right.

01:16:13.052 --> 01:16:14.804
I'll leave 'em with you
while I go see Pete.

01:16:14.887 --> 01:16:17.106
Be ready
when you come back.

01:16:45.584 --> 01:16:48.588
We are about to unite
this loving and devoted couple

01:16:48.671 --> 01:16:51.550
in the holy bonds
of wedlock.

01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:54.560
Hank Ginnis, do you
take this woman

01:16:54.635 --> 01:16:56.308
to be your
lawful wedded wife?

01:16:56.387 --> 01:16:57.764
I do.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:01.021
Abigail Vance,
do you take this man

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.603
to be your
lawful wedded husband?

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.942
She does!

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.352
Hey, Flack.

01:18:19.428 --> 01:18:20.429
Yeah?

01:18:20.513 --> 01:18:24.563
You recollect how Coleman done
told you that if Lopez here,

01:18:24.642 --> 01:18:27.771
or Thorpe done strayed off
into the brush,

01:18:27.853 --> 01:18:29.446
they weren't likely as how
never come back?

01:18:29.522 --> 01:18:30.569
Sure!

01:18:30.648 --> 01:18:33.697
He made some kind of a bluff.
What of it?

01:18:33.776 --> 01:18:35.778
Well, uh,
Thorpe strayed out

01:18:35.861 --> 01:18:38.364
and he ain't
a-never comin' back.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.448
Hey?

01:18:39.532 --> 01:18:40.875
No.

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:45.463
He's done gone back
to his old plantation.

01:18:45.538 --> 01:18:47.461
Yeah.

01:18:51.377 --> 01:18:54.472
Well, you won't go to
California with Thorpe now.

01:18:54.547 --> 01:18:55.719
Why not?

01:18:55.798 --> 01:18:57.800
He and Coleman
just met in the brush,

01:18:57.883 --> 01:19:00.477
and Coleman shot him.

01:19:00.553 --> 01:19:01.725
Are you sure?

01:19:01.804 --> 01:19:03.522
I heard the shot.

01:19:03.597 --> 01:19:05.770
And I saw Coleman
standing there over him.

01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:07.852
It suits me too.

01:19:09.436 --> 01:19:11.689
So he'll even do murder.

01:19:11.772 --> 01:19:15.322
And so I pronounce you
man and wife.

01:19:15.401 --> 01:19:17.995
And may peace
and happiness be yours.

01:19:23.242 --> 01:19:25.836
There's been a murder!
There's been a murder!

01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:29.461
A murder? Where?
Where, girl? Who?

01:19:29.540 --> 01:19:32.259
Coleman met Mr. Thorpe
in the brush and shot him!

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:35.508
That's a serious accusation, my girl.
Are you sure?

01:19:35.588 --> 01:19:36.680
My brother saw it.

01:19:36.755 --> 01:19:40.350
Men, we can't have cold-blooded
murderers among us.

01:19:40.426 --> 01:19:42.679
There's the man
that shot Bill Thorpe

01:19:42.761 --> 01:19:44.934
down like a dog.
Lopez, go and get a rope.

01:19:45.014 --> 01:19:46.015
Get a rope.

01:19:46.098 --> 01:19:47.099
Yeah, get the rope!

01:19:47.183 --> 01:19:50.312
And just who accuses me
of killing Thorpe?

01:19:50.769 --> 01:19:54.069
It, uh...
It was Miss Cameron.

01:19:55.608 --> 01:19:57.656
Huh.

01:19:57.735 --> 01:20:00.454
You, eh?

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:03.078
So you'd like
to see me hang.

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:10.753
Listen to me, you.

01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:13.209
This boy, Coleman, here just
couldn't have killed Thorpe.

01:20:13.292 --> 01:20:14.384
Why not?

01:20:14.460 --> 01:20:16.212
'Cause he didn't
have no guns on him.

01:20:16.295 --> 01:20:18.047
He left his'n with
Dutch Henry to be fixed.

01:20:18.130 --> 01:20:20.428
Coleman and Thorpe were at
odds with the Cameron girl.

01:20:20.507 --> 01:20:22.851
If it wasn't Coleman,
who was it who shot Thorpe?

01:20:22.927 --> 01:20:26.022
Since you're aimin' to know,
I'll tell you who done it.

01:20:26.096 --> 01:20:28.849
Who?
I shot that skunk myself!

01:20:28.933 --> 01:20:30.901
Coleman's a friend
of his, men.

01:20:30.976 --> 01:20:32.978
He's lying to save his neck.

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:35.360
What could Zeke have
against a man like Thorpe?

01:20:35.439 --> 01:20:36.440
You want to know that too?

01:20:36.523 --> 01:20:37.695
Yes, I want
to know that too!

01:20:37.775 --> 01:20:38.901
Well, I'm a-tellin' ya.

01:20:39.526 --> 01:20:41.699
I was camped out
pretty close to you,

01:20:41.779 --> 01:20:45.249
and I heared that powwow
you had with Thorpe.

01:20:45.324 --> 01:20:46.576
Yeah? What are
you driving at?

01:20:46.659 --> 01:20:47.911
Just this.

01:20:47.993 --> 01:20:50.587
When a man begins to do a lot
of talkin' about hangin',

01:20:50.663 --> 01:20:52.711
he'd better make
pretty sure as to who's

01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:54.792
gonna decorate
the end of the rope.

01:20:54.875 --> 01:20:55.876
Get my meaning?

01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:58.804
Well, Thorpe ain't nothin' to me.
It's no affair of mine.

01:20:58.879 --> 01:21:00.506
That's just what
I was a-thinkin'.

01:21:00.589 --> 01:21:01.681
Huh.

01:21:01.757 --> 01:21:03.885
And Coleman ain't gonna
do no scouting,

01:21:03.968 --> 01:21:06.596
while I'm boss of this train.

01:21:06.679 --> 01:21:09.899
I'm leaving him behind.

01:21:14.019 --> 01:21:15.362
Coleman would never...

01:21:15.896 --> 01:21:20.242
Ah, now, we're taking on
a new scout.

01:21:20.317 --> 01:21:22.615
Guess again, Flack.

01:21:22.695 --> 01:21:25.244
I started with this outfit, and
I'll be with it at the finish.

01:21:25.322 --> 01:21:26.289
Who says so?

01:21:26.365 --> 01:21:27.617
I'm just telling ya.

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:29.668
I got two reasons.

01:21:29.743 --> 01:21:33.919
One is I told Wellmore
I'd scout the train through.

01:21:33.998 --> 01:21:36.797
The other is a little personal
business I aim to transact

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:38.843
at the end of the trail.

01:21:38.919 --> 01:21:41.923
See if you can figure out
what that is, Flack.

01:21:45.926 --> 01:21:49.467
Coleman, the settlers
are willing to push on.

01:21:49.493 --> 01:21:52.933
We'll follow you.
What's this talk about Injuns?

01:21:53.017 --> 01:21:54.985
It's true.
The Injuns are gathering

01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:56.937
to the westward to stop us
from going through.

01:21:57.021 --> 01:21:59.490
Injuns have never yet
prevented our breed of men

01:21:59.565 --> 01:22:01.533
from travelin'
into the settin' sun.

01:22:01.608 --> 01:22:03.360
Go on. Lead the way.

01:22:03.444 --> 01:22:06.869
Well, get your outfits together.
We're going.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:11.369
Never mind what you see
or what you hear.

01:22:11.452 --> 01:22:15.332
Red Flack is still
boss of the train.

01:22:15.414 --> 01:22:16.666
Get her going!

01:22:16.749 --> 01:22:19.423
Go on.
Let's pull out and follow!

01:22:28.844 --> 01:22:30.846
Giddyap!

01:23:02.503 --> 01:23:04.505
Hup!

01:23:05.631 --> 01:23:07.554
Ho!

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:20.900
Fall in!

01:23:20.979 --> 01:23:22.071
Nag, giddyap!

01:23:22.147 --> 01:23:23.273
Get in!

01:23:53.846 --> 01:23:56.224
It's no use, men.

01:23:56.306 --> 01:23:58.058
She's all dried up.

01:23:58.142 --> 01:24:02.443
Hey, them settlers
is dyin' off like rats.

01:24:02.521 --> 01:24:06.276
We're for moving on.
Come on, Lopez.

01:24:06.358 --> 01:24:10.704
Boy, they're scattered
back all across the desert.

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:14.204
We gotta gather 'em up
and shove 'em along.

01:24:45.898 --> 01:24:48.651
Old Charlie died, Coleman.

01:24:48.734 --> 01:24:51.453
We raised him from a colt.

01:24:51.528 --> 01:24:53.701
Tough, boy.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:56.124
But we gotta
battle it through.

01:24:59.953 --> 01:25:02.547
Hyah!

01:25:04.041 --> 01:25:06.169
Giddyap!

01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:09.972
Giddyap, Toby!
Giddyap, Toby! Giddyap!

01:25:10.047 --> 01:25:11.173
Giddyap there!
Giddyap, Toby!

01:25:11.256 --> 01:25:12.883
Come on!

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:15.844
Come on!

01:25:18.096 --> 01:25:20.098
Work 'em on through!

01:27:50.165 --> 01:27:52.042
Whoa!

01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:55.170
What's all this?

01:27:56.171 --> 01:27:58.014
Injun signs!

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:00.343
Pull up! Pull up!

01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.262
Pull up!

01:28:35.127 --> 01:28:37.129
Pull up there!

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.156
Pull over!

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:04.906
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:29:27.929 --> 01:29:29.055
Here's your gun, boy!

01:29:29.139 --> 01:29:30.732
All right.

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:36.529
Get up there.

01:29:41.067 --> 01:29:44.321
Come on! Come on!
Get in here! Hurry up!

01:29:44.404 --> 01:29:46.702
Don't panic!

01:30:00.504 --> 01:30:01.972
Looks like
Crows and Cheyennes, Zeke.

01:30:02.047 --> 01:30:03.219
Yeah.

01:30:10.514 --> 01:30:13.438
Now let's throw it into 'em!

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:06.036
Stop shootin', everybody!

01:31:06.111 --> 01:31:09.081
Stop shootin'!
They're ridin' off.

01:31:09.281 --> 01:31:13.127
When they wheel back on us,
reload it up and give it to 'em!

01:32:33.865 --> 01:32:35.867
Yes, sir!

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:38.921
There they go, boy.
There they go.

01:32:38.995 --> 01:32:43.125
Ha! I guess we was just
a little too much for 'em.

01:33:12.946 --> 01:33:16.325
Father, our good
friends have perished here

01:33:16.408 --> 01:33:18.786
at the hands of the savages.

01:33:18.868 --> 01:33:23.044
Open your arms to them
and care for our loved ones

01:33:23.123 --> 01:33:25.592
until we meet again
on the other shore.

01:33:25.667 --> 01:33:27.590
Amen.

01:33:31.798 --> 01:33:34.802
Well, Zeke...

01:33:34.884 --> 01:33:37.683
Ol' Windy's gone
on another trail.

01:33:40.890 --> 01:33:44.440
Windy, you and me was...

01:33:45.895 --> 01:33:49.616
Well, you and me was, uh...

01:33:53.403 --> 01:33:55.531
Oh, my baby!

01:33:55.613 --> 01:33:58.867
My baby! Oh, no!

01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:00.952
My baby!

01:34:04.497 --> 01:34:07.546
Well, Zeke, I'm gonna
trail the Injuns

01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:10.048
and make sure they go
back to their villages.

01:34:10.128 --> 01:34:11.254
So you scout
the train ahead,

01:34:11.337 --> 01:34:13.214
and I'll pick it up
in a week or so.

01:34:13.298 --> 01:34:15.300
Bye, Zeke.

01:34:16.426 --> 01:34:18.428
Bye, boy.

01:35:03.598 --> 01:35:04.770
Giddyap, there!

01:35:04.849 --> 01:35:07.147
Giddyap, there!
Giddyap!

01:35:07.227 --> 01:35:09.525
Get over there!
Giddyap, there!

01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:11.606
Come on, boys.

01:35:17.904 --> 01:35:20.373
Get a hold of that wheel!

01:35:21.491 --> 01:35:22.788
Tough time!

01:35:22.867 --> 01:35:24.119
Lopez! Lopez,
get 'em in line!

01:35:24.202 --> 01:35:25.294
<i>Hey, sí!</i>

01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:26.622
Put the whip to them!

01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:34.884
Hey!

01:35:34.963 --> 01:35:36.135
Pull the trailers!

01:35:36.214 --> 01:35:37.466
Giddyap there!

01:35:37.549 --> 01:35:38.926
Get on Up!

01:35:39.008 --> 01:35:40.225
Work 'em over!

01:35:41.886 --> 01:35:43.888
Go on!

01:35:47.392 --> 01:35:49.394
Get outta there!

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:51.650
Come on, Bob!

01:35:51.729 --> 01:35:53.322
Get 'em movin' to the right!

01:35:53.398 --> 01:35:55.366
Get over there!

01:35:55.441 --> 01:35:59.036
Hey! Get over there!
Giddyap, boy!

01:35:59.571 --> 01:36:03.166
Come on. Come on.
Giddyap. Giddyap.

01:36:04.075 --> 01:36:06.077
There we go!

01:36:06.327 --> 01:36:09.547
I wonder how long
we'll be bogged down here.

01:36:09.622 --> 01:36:12.501
I don't know. I heard there
was three wagons already turned back.

01:36:12.584 --> 01:36:15.178
Ma, let's turn back
to Missouri!

01:36:15.253 --> 01:36:18.928
Me? Turn back because
of a little mud?

01:36:19.007 --> 01:36:22.511
Say, Uncle, when did
Bascom women ever turn back?

01:36:22.594 --> 01:36:26.315
Grandma, don't you and Ma
know that Pa is only jokin'?

01:36:26.389 --> 01:36:29.814
Ha! All right now.
Be powerful on it now.

01:36:29.893 --> 01:36:32.692
Hyah! Hyah!

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:38.364
Go on there, Fanny!
Go on, Meg!

01:36:38.443 --> 01:36:41.697
Go on there, Jennie!
Jennie, go on! Go on, go on!

01:36:41.779 --> 01:36:43.781
Oh, we're stuck.

01:36:43.865 --> 01:36:46.869
Gus, you idiot!
You see what you've done?

01:36:46.951 --> 01:36:49.579
You've got my wagon
up to the hub in mud!

01:36:49.662 --> 01:36:53.212
What are you kickin' about?
I am sitting on my mule.

01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:54.383
Oh!

01:36:54.459 --> 01:36:55.426
But don't worry, Mama.

01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:58.880
I think it's gonna clear up.
There will be no more rain.

01:36:58.963 --> 01:37:01.216
Get up! Get up!
Throw that idiot...

01:37:01.299 --> 01:37:03.222
Throw that idiot a rope
and help him out of there.

01:37:11.935 --> 01:37:13.937
Keep in line!

01:37:18.316 --> 01:37:20.910
Get up here!

01:37:20.985 --> 01:37:23.488
Take the settlers
to the right!

01:37:24.781 --> 01:37:26.783
Get over here!

01:37:31.496 --> 01:37:32.622
Get up in there!

01:37:35.667 --> 01:37:38.216
Come over here and hold on.

01:37:38.294 --> 01:37:43.551
Giddyap there!

01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:05.822
Keep it in line!

01:38:16.374 --> 01:38:18.126
Get over there!
Get over there!

01:38:21.212 --> 01:38:23.214
Come on, boy!

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:34.609
Giddyap there!

01:38:40.523 --> 01:38:42.525
Keep it going!

01:39:08.926 --> 01:39:11.725
Come on there!

01:39:17.185 --> 01:39:19.187
Keep it going!

01:39:50.009 --> 01:39:52.888
Here, Abbie.
Here's the water.

01:39:52.970 --> 01:39:54.563
Mama,
I got good news for you.

01:39:54.639 --> 01:39:56.516
Ah, you're always
bad news to me.

01:39:56.599 --> 01:39:58.067
Get on your long
underwear quick.

01:39:58.893 --> 01:39:59.894
Why?

01:39:59.977 --> 01:40:04.528
Well, you're going in the snow
up to your... Up to your... Your...

01:40:04.607 --> 01:40:08.328
Way up, Mama. And hand
me out my bear overcoat.

01:40:09.654 --> 01:40:10.871
Well, Useless...

01:40:10.947 --> 01:40:14.668
You're going someplace
you won't want to sit down.

01:40:14.992 --> 01:40:17.836
It's so cold,
it'll freeze your hooves off.

01:40:17.912 --> 01:40:19.505
You wait and see.

01:40:19.831 --> 01:40:22.380
Think I'll go say howdy
to the Camerons.

01:40:27.505 --> 01:40:28.722
This is my best overcoat.

01:40:28.798 --> 01:40:31.051
Well, I'd hate to
see your worst one.

01:40:31.467 --> 01:40:32.468
Hello, Gus.

01:40:32.552 --> 01:40:33.599
Oh, hello there, Breck.

01:40:33.678 --> 01:40:35.601
I'm certainly glad
to see you back again.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:37.682
What are you wearing
the heavy overcoat for?

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:39.392
I'm getting all
ready for that snow.

01:40:39.517 --> 01:40:41.190
No, we won't be
there for days.

01:40:41.269 --> 01:40:44.148
Well, anyway, I'm going
to keep warm by the camp.

01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:46.073
Where's the Cameron outfit?

01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:47.901
Oh, we left them
four or five days back.

01:40:47.984 --> 01:40:49.782
Left 'em?

01:40:49.861 --> 01:40:51.613
Yes. All their horses give
out. They couldn't go on.

01:40:51.696 --> 01:40:54.950
Fifteen, 20 wagons. They
all went back to the fort.

01:40:55.032 --> 01:40:56.955
I hated to tell ya, son.

01:40:57.034 --> 01:40:58.957
Zeke, why did you
let the Camerons go?

01:40:59.078 --> 01:41:01.001
Ah, not my doin', son.

01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.503
Flack knows
I savvy Injun sign,

01:41:03.583 --> 01:41:05.176
so he sends me
on ahead to scout.

01:41:05.251 --> 01:41:07.595
And when I come back,
they'd all dropped out.

01:41:07.670 --> 01:41:10.344
If Injuns chance on those wagons,
they'll kill the lot of 'em.

01:41:10.423 --> 01:41:12.642
I'm afeard so, Breck boy.

01:41:12.717 --> 01:41:14.435
The Way's clear ahead, Zeke.
You scout 'em.

01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:15.602
Yeah.

01:41:15.678 --> 01:41:16.804
I'm going back
for the Camerons.

01:41:16.888 --> 01:41:17.935
Good luck, son!

01:41:18.014 --> 01:41:19.061
Giddyap, Jennie!

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:20.141
Well, Useless...

01:41:20.224 --> 01:41:21.567
Giddyap, Jennie!

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:22.939
I don't know who smells
the worse, you or me.

01:41:23.019 --> 01:41:23.986
Go ahead there!

01:41:24.061 --> 01:41:25.187
Come on. Here we go again.

01:41:25.271 --> 01:41:27.273
Pull, Fanny!

01:41:57.094 --> 01:41:59.142
Hello! Hello!

01:41:59.222 --> 01:42:01.224
Huh!

01:42:05.937 --> 01:42:08.611
I felt someway
that you'd come.

01:42:09.398 --> 01:42:11.947
I'd have been here
a heap sooner if I could've.

01:42:12.777 --> 01:42:14.700
Say, Dave, you'd
better out off that trailer

01:42:14.779 --> 01:42:16.031
and throw everything
into one wagon.

01:42:16.113 --> 01:42:17.114
All right.

01:42:17.281 --> 01:42:18.533
I'll hitch up Ol' Rhody

01:42:18.616 --> 01:42:21.119
and we'll see if we can
get out of here.

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:24.372
After you left,

01:42:24.455 --> 01:42:27.208
old Zeke told me the truth
about some matters.

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:29.301
Thorpe and Flack and all.

01:42:30.044 --> 01:42:31.637
He did, eh?

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:33.806
Sorry I was so stupid.

01:42:34.382 --> 01:42:38.387
Oh, don't worry, Miss Ruth.
Things did look sort of queer.

01:42:38.469 --> 01:42:40.597
I should have known better.

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:44.480
Well, we all get off on the
wrong trail once in a while.

01:42:46.936 --> 01:42:49.359
We'll make it
through all right.

01:42:49.438 --> 01:42:52.066
Well, that's fixed.
Can I do something, Breck?

01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:54.402
No, I guess not.

01:42:54.485 --> 01:42:57.785
We oughta overtake those
settlers in a week or so.

01:42:57.905 --> 01:43:00.624
Here you are, Ruthie.
Take it.

01:43:10.334 --> 01:43:11.756
We're goin' again, Davey.

01:43:11.836 --> 01:43:13.133
Heave-ho.

01:43:16.799 --> 01:43:20.303
Pull 'er there. Come on.
Come on there, Shortie.

01:43:44.785 --> 01:43:47.755
What did I tell you, huh?
You wouldn't listen to me.

01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:50.800
You wouldn't listen to me!
We're lost!

01:43:50.875 --> 01:43:54.596
There ain't a man here that
knows the pass over them hills!

01:43:54.670 --> 01:43:56.047
We're for turning back!

01:43:57.590 --> 01:43:59.592
Wait! Wait!

01:43:59.675 --> 01:44:03.305
Follow me and I'll lead you to that
valley that Coleman told us about.

01:44:03.387 --> 01:44:08.143
Coleman, huh? He's the
only one that knows the way out,

01:44:08.225 --> 01:44:10.694
and he's deserted us!

01:44:10.770 --> 01:44:11.817
Sure, he quit!

01:44:11.896 --> 01:44:15.241
If he was here, I'd shoot
him down in his tracks.

01:44:16.233 --> 01:44:19.237
Well, Flack, just when
you gonna start this shootin'?

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:23.075
You're just in time, Coleman.
Did you find the Camerons?

01:44:23.157 --> 01:44:25.205
They're over yonder.
What's the trouble here?

01:44:25.284 --> 01:44:28.083
They're all against me.
They're turning back.

01:44:28.162 --> 01:44:30.415
No, you're not!

01:44:30.498 --> 01:44:32.717
We can't turn back.

01:44:32.792 --> 01:44:35.386
We're blazing a trail
that started in England.

01:44:35.461 --> 01:44:36.963
Not even storms
of the sea could

01:44:37.046 --> 01:44:39.174
turn back those
first settlers.

01:44:39.256 --> 01:44:41.429
And they carried
it on further.

01:44:41.509 --> 01:44:44.353
They blazed it on through
the wilderness of Kentucky.

01:44:44.428 --> 01:44:48.399
Famine, hunger, not even
massacres could stop them.

01:44:48.474 --> 01:44:50.727
And now we've picked up
the trail again,

01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:53.438
and nothing can stop us!

01:44:53.521 --> 01:44:57.196
Not even the snows of winter nor the
peaks of the highest mountains.

01:44:57.274 --> 01:45:00.949
We're building a nation!
So we've got to suffer.

01:45:01.737 --> 01:45:05.537
No great trail was ever
blazed without hardship.

01:45:05.616 --> 01:45:08.870
And you've gotta fight!
That's life.

01:45:08.953 --> 01:45:11.706
And when you stop fightin',
that's death.

01:45:11.789 --> 01:45:13.883
What are you gonna do,
lie down and die?

01:45:14.208 --> 01:45:15.300
No!

01:45:15.418 --> 01:45:16.510
No!

01:45:16.585 --> 01:45:19.179
Not in a thousand years.
You're going on with me!

01:45:19.255 --> 01:45:22.225
The word is said,
and we'll follow you.

01:45:22.299 --> 01:45:23.551
Be ready to start at sunup!

01:45:32.476 --> 01:45:35.400
Well... Well,
he's turned up again.

01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:40.493
Yeah, well, he'll down
the both of us.

01:45:40.568 --> 01:45:42.946
You've got to
get him tonight.

01:45:43.028 --> 01:45:44.996
But they can hear
a shot at night.

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:46.745
Well, they can't
hear a knife.

01:45:46.824 --> 01:45:48.201
They all know
this knife of mine.

01:45:49.452 --> 01:45:54.128
Well, here's a knife
they don't know.

01:45:54.206 --> 01:45:55.753
No, no, no, no.
I afraid of that knife.

01:45:57.501 --> 01:45:58.502
I know where you got it.

01:45:58.586 --> 01:46:00.179
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:46:00.796 --> 01:46:02.844
It will get us
in trouble sure.

01:46:03.007 --> 01:46:05.055
How?

01:46:05.134 --> 01:46:06.932
Because a dead man's
knife is bad medicine!

01:46:08.554 --> 01:46:10.556
Here, just stop that drivel.
No.

01:46:10.639 --> 01:46:14.564
Take the knife and
wait for tonight.

01:46:19.398 --> 01:46:20.741
There he goes.

01:46:24.820 --> 01:46:28.825
Wait until he's bedded down,
and then...

01:46:37.541 --> 01:46:39.919
Give me a drink.

01:46:40.002 --> 01:46:43.757
God bless my sister Ruth
and my brother Dave,

01:46:43.839 --> 01:46:46.843
and make me a good girl,
and take care of us.

01:46:48.803 --> 01:46:51.807
Aren't you going to ask God to
take care of Breck Coleman?

01:46:51.889 --> 01:46:55.814
Oh, Zeke says that Breck Coleman
can take care of himself.

01:47:15.246 --> 01:47:18.921
You overplayed
your hand that time, Lopez!

01:47:33.138 --> 01:47:36.187
Zeke, this is
old Ben Griswell's knife.

01:47:37.893 --> 01:47:39.486
Well, where'd you
find it, boy?

01:47:39.562 --> 01:47:42.611
Lopez just left it
sticking in my bedroll.

01:47:42.731 --> 01:47:45.701
Their having it makes it certain
that Flack and Lopez did it.

01:47:45.776 --> 01:47:47.528
No question about it, boy.

01:47:47.611 --> 01:47:48.828
What did they do, Coleman?

01:47:48.904 --> 01:47:50.156
Killed my best friend.

01:47:50.239 --> 01:47:52.116
I been on their
trail ever since.

01:47:52.199 --> 01:47:53.997
That's a serious charge.

01:47:54.076 --> 01:47:57.797
If you're sure, we'll call a settlers'
meeting in the morning to try 'em.

01:47:57.872 --> 01:48:00.045
You can call a settlers'
meeting to bury 'em.

01:48:00.124 --> 01:48:01.125
What do you mean?

01:48:01.208 --> 01:48:03.586
That I kill my own rats!

01:48:18.309 --> 01:48:21.563
They've jumped camp,
Zeke, and I'm off on their trail.

01:48:21.645 --> 01:48:23.647
Breck, you can't leave us here!

01:48:23.731 --> 01:48:25.574
You got to see us through.

01:48:25.691 --> 01:48:27.534
He's right, boy.

01:48:27.610 --> 01:48:30.454
Maybe so, the way
you all look at it.

01:48:30.529 --> 01:48:33.328
But those two men
killed a man in cold blood,

01:48:33.407 --> 01:48:36.377
and they've got to pay.

01:48:36.452 --> 01:48:39.080
It's not that I've got
hatred in my heart,

01:48:39.163 --> 01:48:41.416
but that I'm the law
out here, that's all.

01:48:41.498 --> 01:48:43.842
And the law is justice.

01:48:46.211 --> 01:48:50.591
Well, Zeke, I'll see 'em
to the end of the trail.

01:48:50.674 --> 01:48:53.052
But then I'm picking up
a new trail here.

01:49:13.364 --> 01:49:16.243
Get over! Get over!

01:49:16.325 --> 01:49:17.417
Get over here!

01:49:17.493 --> 01:49:18.494
Hah! Get over! Hah!

01:49:18.577 --> 01:49:19.624
Get over!

01:49:19.703 --> 01:49:20.750
Whoa, hah! Whoa, hah!

01:49:20.829 --> 01:49:22.126
Whoa, hah!

01:49:22.206 --> 01:49:23.833
Get over! Pull!

01:49:30.547 --> 01:49:34.177
Yonder stands
the great white mountain.

01:49:34.259 --> 01:49:37.103
And down below lies the
valley I've told you about.

01:49:37.179 --> 01:49:40.900
Coleman, you have
fulfilled our hopes.

01:49:41.892 --> 01:49:45.396
Neighbors!
Friends!

01:49:45.479 --> 01:49:48.904
It is fitting that we give
thanks to the Almighty.

01:49:52.027 --> 01:49:57.124
Our Father, we thank thee for
leading us to this land of promise,

01:49:57.199 --> 01:49:59.122
for guiding our
footsteps safely

01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:01.579
through the dangers
of our pilgrimage.

01:50:02.079 --> 01:50:04.173
In this valley of
our dreams, we'll build

01:50:04.248 --> 01:50:06.467
our homes and
serve thee, O Father.

01:50:07.084 --> 01:50:10.634
And our children's children
shall praise thy name.

01:50:10.713 --> 01:50:12.715
Amen.

01:50:16.593 --> 01:50:20.723
The way is clear ahead.
All gentle slopes.

01:50:20.806 --> 01:50:23.480
So drive down, my friends,
and settle it.

01:50:23.559 --> 01:50:25.436
Lead the way.

01:50:25.519 --> 01:50:27.567
Zeke will lead the way down.

01:50:27.896 --> 01:50:29.523
Our trails fork here.

01:50:29.606 --> 01:50:31.279
You mean you are
leaving us?

01:50:32.192 --> 01:50:36.538
There's a trail I've followed
for over 3,000 miles now,

01:50:36.613 --> 01:50:40.368
and I'm headin' back to pick it up
again and follow it to the end.

01:50:40.951 --> 01:50:43.204
Coleman,
you're the breed of man

01:50:43.287 --> 01:50:46.006
that would follow
a trail to the end.

01:50:46.081 --> 01:50:48.049
Thanks, Bascom.

01:50:48.125 --> 01:50:50.298
Friends, we'll go on.

01:50:50.544 --> 01:50:54.515
Boy, there's two of 'em.
Bad ones.

01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:57.218
Now, I'm going with you.

01:50:57.301 --> 01:50:59.645
No, Zeke.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.940
You stay here and look after
Ruth and her outfit.

01:51:08.645 --> 01:51:11.819
Breck, you're not leaving.

01:51:11.899 --> 01:51:14.152
Yes, Miss Ruth.
I'm pullin' out.

01:51:14.234 --> 01:51:17.408
They say you're going to
hunt down Flack and Lopez.

01:51:17.488 --> 01:51:18.785
That's what I aim to do.

01:51:18.864 --> 01:51:20.741
But you can't do
this awful thing...

01:51:20.824 --> 01:51:23.498
Take two lives!

01:51:23.577 --> 01:51:26.251
It's frontier justice.

01:51:26.330 --> 01:51:29.083
Don't go, Breck.
Don't go!

01:51:29.166 --> 01:51:32.090
It's a job
I've got to finish.

01:51:32.169 --> 01:51:34.547
But don't you see?

01:51:34.630 --> 01:51:38.430
It doesn't matter about them.
I'm afraid for you.

01:51:38.509 --> 01:51:40.511
They'll kill you!

01:51:43.722 --> 01:51:47.226
You're everything
in the world to me, Breck.

01:51:47.309 --> 01:51:50.688
I can't let you go!
I can't!

01:51:52.773 --> 01:51:55.117
The thing has to be done.

01:51:57.319 --> 01:51:59.242
Someday...

01:52:00.239 --> 01:52:02.333
Somewhere...

01:52:02.407 --> 01:52:05.081
Our trails will cross again.

01:52:11.625 --> 01:52:14.504
Now, now.
Come, come, miss.

01:52:14.586 --> 01:52:17.635
You mustn't be
a-carryin' on thataway.

01:52:17.714 --> 01:52:21.139
He's gone.
He'll never come back.

01:52:21.218 --> 01:52:24.893
Now, now, you just mustn't
do this, miss.

01:52:24.972 --> 01:52:27.976
You'll have me a-blubberin'
here pretty soon.

01:52:28.058 --> 01:52:31.562
I'm a-tellin' ya that everything
is going to be all right.

01:52:31.645 --> 01:52:33.989
When spring comes
in that valley,

01:52:34.064 --> 01:52:36.237
he'll be tracking back again.

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:40.162
I know that boy.
I know him.

01:52:40.237 --> 01:52:44.162
Now, come, come.
Come on, Ruth.

01:52:44.241 --> 01:52:45.538
Come on.

01:53:10.726 --> 01:53:13.275
My legs are
froze to the knees.

01:53:14.104 --> 01:53:15.356
I can't get up.

01:53:15.439 --> 01:53:18.909
Yes, looks as if
you're done for, Lopez.

01:53:18.984 --> 01:53:21.362
But, Flack, don't go away
and leave me, Flack.

01:53:21.445 --> 01:53:24.870
What? Do you think
I'm staying here?

01:53:24.948 --> 01:53:26.700
Well, then leave me a blanket!
I'm frozen.

01:53:26.783 --> 01:53:28.501
Ah, won't do you no good.

01:53:28.577 --> 01:53:31.171
You'll be froze to
death in an hour.

01:53:31.246 --> 01:53:32.293
Flack!

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:33.373
It may help me.
Now get away.

01:53:33.457 --> 01:53:34.629
Flack! Flack!

01:53:35.918 --> 01:53:39.639
Flack, don't let me
die alone!

01:53:39.713 --> 01:53:41.715
Stay with me! Flack!

01:53:46.678 --> 01:53:50.023
Flack!

01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:17.542
Well, Lopez.

01:54:17.626 --> 01:54:20.425
It won't be long
before you have company.

01:55:08.218 --> 01:55:10.312
Flack!

01:55:50.427 --> 01:55:52.350
Yeah, Milt.

01:55:52.429 --> 01:55:55.774
I got a hankerin' to trail
on down into Mexico.

01:55:55.849 --> 01:55:57.351
Old Bill Gillie
done told me

01:55:57.434 --> 01:56:01.484
that them there black-eyed
gals is just full of fire.

01:56:01.563 --> 01:56:02.689
Zeke?
Yeah?

01:56:02.773 --> 01:56:04.320
Zeke, you're not
really leaving us?

01:56:04.733 --> 01:56:08.783
Yeah, gal, I'm a-pullin' out. You
is all nice and settled now.

01:56:08.862 --> 01:56:10.114
And this here
valley is gettin'

01:56:10.197 --> 01:56:12.746
altogether too
civilized for me.

01:56:12.824 --> 01:56:14.542
Whenever I get more
than three or four families

01:56:14.618 --> 01:56:15.870
within a hundred mile
of me,

01:56:15.952 --> 01:56:18.580
I begin to feel
kind of crowded.

01:56:18.663 --> 01:56:21.257
That's not why
you're going, Zeke.

01:56:21.333 --> 01:56:24.678
No? Why else, gal?

01:56:24.753 --> 01:56:29.179
Breck has never come back. You're
going out to look for him.

01:56:29.257 --> 01:56:31.555
Now, wherever that boy
Breck Coleman is at,

01:56:31.635 --> 01:56:33.808
he's a-lookin'
out for hisself.

01:56:33.887 --> 01:56:36.060
Now don't you
fret about him.

01:56:43.605 --> 01:56:46.233
Did you give
away all your little puppies?

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:55.413
Why are you
looking at that dress?

01:56:57.411 --> 01:57:00.130
This is
the anniversary of the...

01:57:00.205 --> 01:57:03.709
The day that the wagon
train left from Missouri.

01:57:05.335 --> 01:57:07.963
Last time I had this on,

01:57:08.046 --> 01:57:10.640
I was sitting in
the Riggses' cabin.

01:57:10.715 --> 01:57:12.934
In a rocking chair?

01:57:13.009 --> 01:57:15.011
Yes, Honey Girl.

01:57:16.555 --> 01:57:18.557
In a rocking chair.

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:30.277
Zeke, I reckon
that's a panther.

01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:33.113
Yeah!
It's a two-legged panther.

01:57:33.196 --> 01:57:36.951
The only kind whatever gimme
that Comanche yell as a signal.

01:57:37.033 --> 01:57:40.628
We might just as well
start to unpack.

01:57:40.704 --> 01:57:42.251
What, ain't you going?

01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:43.798
No use of going now.

01:57:43.874 --> 01:57:47.344
He's only a bit up in the timber
there, and he's a-headed this way.

01:57:47.419 --> 01:57:49.797
Zeke, won't you stay over
for the anniversary?

01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.927
Yes, gal, I'll stay.

01:57:51.006 --> 01:57:52.007
Aw!

01:57:52.090 --> 01:57:54.889
And I just recollected, I got
a little present for you.

01:57:54.968 --> 01:57:56.220
Oh, Zeke, what is it?

01:57:56.303 --> 01:57:59.603
Well, a young fella named Breck
Coleman left it with me,

01:57:59.681 --> 01:58:03.902
and he told me to give it to
you in case he didn't show up.

01:58:03.977 --> 01:58:04.978
Where is it, Zeke?

01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:08.986
I hid it in the holler of the big
tree at the bend of the trail.

01:58:09.065 --> 01:58:11.318
You'll find it there.

01:58:11.401 --> 01:58:13.574
Thanks, Zeke.
I'll go get it.
