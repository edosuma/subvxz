02:17.437 --> 02:20.272
- Ok, Pete, time's up.
- I used to fly one of those.

02:20.340 --> 02:23.108
- Fly what?
- B-17, flying fortress.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.910
I served on one.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.680
Oh, yeah, the flight museum
must be doing another air show.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.563
Give me a break. I'm still
a man, for Christ's sake.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.497
Relax, Pete.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.179
- We know what we're doing.
- Take it easy.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.567
Come on.

02:48.569 --> 02:52.271
Hey, wait. You're cutting off
my circulation here.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.606
Ok, boys.

02:54.674 --> 02:56.975
Ripley, thank god you're here.

02:57.677 --> 03:00.746
I can't go to the bathroom
like a normal person

03:00.748 --> 03:04.950
and they think I'm crazy because
I don't care if I live anymore.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.653
I'm dying anyway.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.656
What does it matter if I knock
off a couple of months?

03:10.723 --> 03:12.791
It matters to me.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.335
Hey, I found an address on one
of those names you wanted.

03:23.403 --> 03:25.737
Just one?

03:25.739 --> 03:28.240
Sorry, Pete.

03:28.242 --> 03:30.342
John Pernell.

03:31.678 --> 03:35.480
He was our pilot. We called
him eagle eye.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.650
Hey, I'll show you.
Give me my ammo box.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.957
Make me a promise.
No escape attempts.

03:45.024 --> 03:47.659
I got nowhere to go.

03:52.699 --> 03:56.668
Now, that chap right there,
that's eagle eye.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.840
Got something to write with?

04:04.410 --> 04:06.945
- Ah, good.
- I'll be back in a few minutes.

04:07.013 --> 04:08.747
Ok.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.956
- Who are you writing?
- None of your damn business.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.225
I've never seen you
write nobody.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.095
You like that pretty little
nurse, don't you?

04:23.162 --> 04:26.431
- I see the way you look at her.
- You're disgusting.

04:26.499 --> 04:28.800
Couldn't do nothin' about it.
I've seen.

04:28.868 --> 04:29.935
You're a pig!

04:29.937 --> 04:34.606
You got nothing left down there but a
little plastic tube to piss through.

04:34.674 --> 04:38.510
- I'm a man! I am still a man!

04:38.578 --> 04:42.948
I guess she has to know you,
who's a man, you son of a bitch!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.684
- I'll kill you! They're coming!
- Dr. Darby, meds!

04:45.752 --> 04:47.619
- They're coming from everywhere!
- Stat!

04:47.621 --> 04:49.621
They're coming from 12 o'clock!

04:49.689 --> 04:52.591
Eagle!

04:52.659 --> 04:55.093
Eagle!

04:59.098 --> 05:02.634
Dad, get in the car. I've been
looking all over for you.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.743
- You've got to stop running off.
- I wasn't running off.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.912
I went to the store.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.415
You can't leave the house
without getting lost anymore.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.151
I think it's time I got
my own place.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.388
I'm ok now.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.892
Come on, face it, dad, you
can't take care of yourself.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.562
- You haven't driven since mom died.
- I can drive.

05:31.564 --> 05:33.565
Not without a license,
you can't.

05:33.567 --> 05:36.068
I just have to take
the test again.

05:36.070 --> 05:40.238
They said I need glasses.
I got 'em. Now I'm ready.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.840
It's not your eyesight
I'm worried about.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.413
Listen, dad, Hilary and I have
made a decision.

05:50.883 --> 05:54.186
Let's discuss it tonight
and we can see what you think.

05:54.188 --> 05:56.788
Since when does it matter
what I think?

05:59.726 --> 06:01.793
Hey, big guy.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.665
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. What do you think?

06:06.733 --> 06:08.633
- Wow.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.602
- Thanks, grandpa.
- You're welcome, my son.

06:10.670 --> 06:14.506
- Where'd you find him this time?
- Couple of blocks from here.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.142
Let's go.

06:24.417 --> 06:29.020
When you were in the war, were you ever
so scared you never wanted to fly again?

06:29.022 --> 06:31.490
Almost every time
I flew a mission.

06:31.557 --> 06:36.061
If you were so scared every time
you flew, why'd you keep doing it?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.163
It was my duty.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.501
It didn't matter how scared I was
or how impossible it all seemed.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.904
We just had to put one foot
in front of the other.

06:45.906 --> 06:50.942
Sometimes bravery comes
one step at a time.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.944
Hey, dad, you got some mail.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.679
It was sent to your old address.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.350
Who's Pete Williams from
Galveston, Texas?

07:01.521 --> 07:03.588
Well, aren't you gonna open it?

07:09.162 --> 07:13.131
Dear eagle. I haven't
been able to find the others.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.901
You and I may be all who's left.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.337
So I'm calling on you to make
good on the oath that we all took

07:19.405 --> 07:21.640
all those many years ago.

07:22.508 --> 07:25.477
Looks as though
you're the last man.

07:25.545 --> 07:29.581
Time's short, eagle.
I haven't got much of it left.

07:29.583 --> 07:35.454
I'm in Galveston, Texas, at the
Va hospital on memorial drive.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.923
Please hurry.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.094
What's the matter, grandpa?

08:04.517 --> 08:06.751
Was the letter bad news?

08:08.321 --> 08:12.290
No, just an old friend I lost
touch with.

08:12.358 --> 08:13.792
What did he want?

08:21.100 --> 08:23.168
The impossible.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.064
What the...?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.167
Dad!

09:35.374 --> 09:37.642
Dad, look what you did!

09:37.710 --> 09:41.246
- What's going on?
- Nothing. Just go do your homework.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.782
- I live here too, you know.
- No, it's just a little accident.

09:43.849 --> 09:47.152
It's not just a little accident.
We no longer have a ceiling.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.659
When are you going to tell him? John,
he's supposed to leave in a few days.

09:54.727 --> 09:57.128
I know, but we're sending him
off to a strange place.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.965
I know it's a strange place,
but it has to happen.

10:00.032 --> 10:03.168
I just never thought I'd be sending
my father off to an old folks' home.

10:03.235 --> 10:06.071
We both agreed that
this isn't working anymore.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.174
- Don't make me the bad guy.
- All right. All right, Hilary.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.942
I'll tell him in the morning.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.469
Ah.

11:40.332 --> 11:42.100
Dear Taylor.

11:42.168 --> 11:45.603
It's come time for me to put
one foot in front of the other

11:45.671 --> 11:48.473
and face some fears once again.

11:50.576 --> 11:54.245
Always remember,
nothing is impossible for you

11:54.247 --> 11:56.581
if you have faith
and an open heart.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.684
I'll be looking out for you.
Love, grandpa.

12:26.946 --> 12:29.013
Taylor?

12:31.884 --> 12:34.419
- Where's grandpa?
- I don't know.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.488
Hmm.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.604
Holy...

12:52.671 --> 12:54.105
Shit!

13:11.157 --> 13:13.458
Hey. Hey, what are you
doing? Give it to me.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.562
Give it to me!

13:21.267 --> 13:23.301
Come here! Hey!

13:26.539 --> 13:28.840
- Hey!
- Why are you chasing me?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.809
I'm not! Come on!

13:34.046 --> 13:36.114
- What are you doing?
- Get in!

13:39.585 --> 13:40.819
Get in!

13:42.721 --> 13:44.656
Come on, hurry up.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.466
We're out of range.
You can sit up now.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.972
Are you all right?

14:01.040 --> 14:03.174
- Stop the car.
- Hey, lighten up, pops.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.176
That guy back there was trying
to kill us.

14:05.244 --> 14:09.514
There is no "us".
Stop the car.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.095
- Get out.
- What?

14:24.163 --> 14:26.898
- You heard me.
- Look, general.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.801
I need a ride to the next town, ok?
My life is in danger.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.838
I don't have time for you
or your problems, lady.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.840
- Romy.
- What?

14:35.908 --> 14:39.911
- My name is Romy.
- You just shot a man back there.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.347
I tried to kill him. I missed.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.854
Ok, look, I'm sorry, ok? I didn't
mean to try to kill anybody.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.392
- What's wrong?
- My glasses.

14:56.028 --> 14:58.096
I don't see them.

15:03.269 --> 15:05.403
Hey. Really?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.339
What, you're just gonna
leave me out here like this?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.978
Get in.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.015
I'll take you to the next town.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.227
So, what did you say
your name was?

15:29.229 --> 15:32.997
John Pernell, but you can
call me eagle eye.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.900
Well, eagle eye, why don't you yank
it over and let me drive for a while

15:35.902 --> 15:37.302
before you get us both killed?

15:37.369 --> 15:40.405
I'm not the one causing wrecks
and shooting people.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.574
No, but at least
I can see the road.

15:52.251 --> 15:55.486
She took off with some guy. I'm
telling you, dad, it was a setup.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.456
Dad, I know. I know I shouldn't
have trusted her. I know that, dad.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.893
Listen, I got Dan Hanks on it. Yeah,
you know, Rudy's friend, the pi.

16:01.895 --> 16:05.596
Dad, hold on. Find that broad,
Hanks. Go get her.

16:05.664 --> 16:08.066
I got it. Did she leave
anything in the car?

16:08.068 --> 16:10.835
- How should I know?
- See you back in town.

16:10.903 --> 16:13.838
All right, buckle up.
Here we go.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.245
Well, general,
that was an experience.

16:21.247 --> 16:24.916
- It's captain.
- Yeah, well, whatever. Good luck.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.529
Look, I need a place to stay
for a couple of nights.

16:42.554 --> 16:44.092
Just until I can
figure this out.

16:45.270 --> 16:48.606
Yeah. Right, yeah, I get it.

16:49.575 --> 16:50.641
Ok.

16:51.777 --> 16:53.845
Yeah, bye.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.317
Hey, let me help you
with that, pops.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.853
- I can do it.
- Not by the looks of it.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.292
So where are you headed to,
a parade or something?

17:09.361 --> 17:13.164
I'm going to Galveston, Texas,
to visit an old friend.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.098
Drive all that way by yourself?

17:15.166 --> 17:18.502
No, I'm gonna stop off in
Pennsylvania and look up a friend

17:18.569 --> 17:21.839
and see if he wants to come along
and help with the driving.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.909
- You're headed to Pennsylvania?
- Yeah.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.078
Well, I hate to break it to you,

17:27.079 --> 17:30.114
but you're headed south
and Pennsylvania's due north.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.652
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll make a deal with you.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.221
I'll drive you to Pennsylvania
to meet up with your friend

17:37.223 --> 17:39.791
and then afterwards you just drop
me off at the train station.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.993
Don't do me any favors.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.128
Don't worry.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.934
Do you have like a recent photograph
that I could take with me?

17:50.002 --> 17:52.070
Oh, yes, of course.

17:52.171 --> 17:56.474
Can you think of any particular
reason why he might have run away?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.809
No, I can't imagine.

17:57.876 --> 18:01.646
Did he seem like he was happy,
you know, living here?

18:01.713 --> 18:05.016
Well, yes, I mean,
for the most part.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.886
I see.

18:08.888 --> 18:12.156
Hey, I wonder if your dad went
to visit friends or something.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.625
Most of his friends are dead.

18:14.693 --> 18:18.996
He did get a letter the other
day from a Pete somebody.

18:19.064 --> 18:22.500
Ok. You got like a number,
address for this guy?

18:22.568 --> 18:25.236
No, but... but I can...
I can look for it.

18:25.238 --> 18:29.173
Yeah, all right. Well, look, I think
I've got enough to get started.

18:29.241 --> 18:33.277
I think a '58 Ford Fairlane, unregistered,
is probably pretty easy to spot.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.281
- Shit.
- What?

18:37.349 --> 18:39.951
- Cop.

18:39.953 --> 18:42.720
- Shit!
- What do you mean, shit?

18:42.722 --> 18:45.256
- I don't have a driver's license.
- Me either.

18:45.324 --> 18:48.559
- Shit!
- Uh, make up a story. Uh...

18:48.561 --> 18:51.395
Tell him I'm sick or
something, all right?

18:51.397 --> 18:52.763
- What?

18:52.831 --> 18:55.166
Oh...

19:11.283 --> 19:13.851
Afternoon, officer.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.654
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- No.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.891
Driver's license and
registration, please.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.093
Oh, god, I forgot my wallet.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.829
Do you have any registration
for the vehicle?

19:24.897 --> 19:27.899
Well, it's actually my
grandfather's. Excuse me.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.433
Grandpa?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.504
- Grandpa?
- Is there a problem?

19:35.207 --> 19:38.609
He's actually... he's...
He's very, very sick.

19:38.677 --> 19:40.745
Where are you headed?

19:41.380 --> 19:44.615
To a funeral...
In Pennsylvania.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.652
You're taking your sick
grandfather to a funeral?

19:48.420 --> 19:52.256
Yes, well, he's actually...
He's... he's sick with grief.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.425
His mother...

19:54.493 --> 19:56.260
His mother?

19:57.696 --> 20:01.132
She was a hundred
and six... Teen?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.602
- Why are you asking me?
- No, I'm not.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.137
Ok, step out of the car, please.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.178
To the back.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.314
Hands on the trunk.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.387
Do you normally wear clothes
like this for funerals?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.724
- No, I...
- Don't move. Shut up.

20:35.434 --> 20:37.501
Sir, can you hear me?

20:38.170 --> 20:40.504
Sir? Are you ok?

20:42.207 --> 20:44.275
- Sir, can you hear me?
- Ok, that's it! Hands up!

20:44.343 --> 20:46.010
- Back away. Against the car.
- Oh, shit.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.913
- Get against the car!
- What are you doing?

20:48.915 --> 20:51.449
Get in the car! Get in!

20:53.151 --> 20:57.054
Ok, uh, all right.
Handcuff one of your arms.

20:57.823 --> 21:00.157
- Hurry up!
- All right, ok.

21:00.225 --> 21:02.293
Ok, put hands behind your back.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.431
- Is that too tight?
- Yeah.

21:07.499 --> 21:09.634
I'm sorry. Get in.

21:11.737 --> 21:13.804
Sorry!

21:26.385 --> 21:28.452
Oh, shit!

21:31.857 --> 21:36.294
- You pointed a gun at me.
- I wasn't gonna shoot you.

21:36.361 --> 21:38.729
- Why did you do it?
- I was scared.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.833
Look, I can't go back, ok?
I can never go back.

21:42.901 --> 21:45.069
What, did you
break out of prison?

21:45.071 --> 21:47.672
Yeah, you could say that.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.675
Do I look like a convict?

21:54.680 --> 21:56.747
I can't go back either.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.219
Look, I'm sorry if I screwed
things up for you.

22:02.221 --> 22:05.156
If the police weren't looking for
you before they certainly are now.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.758
- We've gotta ditch this car.
- We can't do that.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.760
- Why not?
- It's my wife's car.

22:09.828 --> 22:13.164
- You took her car?
- She passed away ten years ago.

22:14.599 --> 22:18.402
Still wear your wedding ring?
That's cute.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.602
- What are you doing?
- Giving thanks.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.604
Yeah, but we're in public.

22:53.672 --> 22:57.341
Since when is it embarrassing
to give thanks?

22:57.409 --> 22:59.510
Yeah, you really are old school.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.680
- What's in Galveston?
- Pete.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.182
Guy who flew with me
during the war.

23:05.250 --> 23:09.320
He's in the hospital and he
doesn't have much time left.

23:09.322 --> 23:12.923
- So why all the trouble?
- It's hard to explain.

23:13.492 --> 23:18.062
The brotherhood of men
and the experience of war.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.998
I get it.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.135
My whole life has been
one battle after the next.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.342
Absolutely not.

23:31.410 --> 23:35.279
He has no family. He has endured
a lifetime of mental anguish.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.515
Over a wound that most men
could not have lived with.

23:37.582 --> 23:41.952
Mr. Williams has been in and out
of this institution since 1946.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.088
I am very familiar
with his case history.

23:44.156 --> 23:48.392
And he doesn't wanna live out the last
few months of his life in restraints.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.594
He's become a danger
to himself and to others.

23:50.662 --> 23:53.063
Besides, we need the bed
space. You know this.

23:53.065 --> 23:55.966
I'm recommending he be transferred
to the state sanitarium.

23:56.034 --> 23:58.936
He's not dangerous
and he's not crazy.

23:59.004 --> 24:02.239
He's angry, and he wants
to die with dignity.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.775
I was unaware, nurse Ripley,
that the RNS on my staff

24:04.843 --> 24:07.611
were qualified to make
psychiatric evaluations.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.581
It's just that I've gotten
to know him.

24:12.083 --> 24:17.321
And since you are one of the most
respected professionals in this hospital,

24:17.323 --> 24:21.158
well... I thought you might
handle this case personally.

24:25.764 --> 24:29.333
I'll have a few sessions with him
before I make my final decision.

24:29.401 --> 24:30.901
But no promises.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.571
Ok?

24:35.874 --> 24:36.941
Something else?

24:48.720 --> 24:51.822
I got some information on your father.
Wanted to share it with you in person.

24:51.890 --> 24:54.225
- Is he all right?
- Well, we're not sure.

24:54.227 --> 24:56.927
- What do you mean?
- I'm afraid your father's been kidnapped.

24:56.995 --> 25:01.265
Possibly carjacked. An officer witnessed
your father being held at gunpoint.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.801
Who would wanna kidnap
an 80-year-old man?

25:03.869 --> 25:07.505
Apparently an attractive young
woman in an evening dress.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.340
Really?

26:08.233 --> 26:10.334
Hey. Hungry?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.469
Got you some donuts.

26:14.272 --> 26:18.609
It's me. Romy.
What do you think?

26:20.011 --> 26:23.814
- What did you do to your hair?
- Felt like being me for a while.

26:23.882 --> 26:25.182
You like it?

26:26.017 --> 26:28.085
Yeah. It's fine.

26:28.153 --> 26:31.722
Fine? Eagle, never tell a
woman she looks fine, ok?

26:31.724 --> 26:35.893
That is pretty much the worst compliment
you could pay a lady. Eat a donut.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.929
I also got you something else.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.466
Try these puppies on.

26:44.235 --> 26:46.437
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

26:46.504 --> 26:50.741
- Mm-mm.
- Ok. How about these?

26:53.545 --> 26:55.613
Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

26:55.680 --> 27:00.818
All right, well, last ones.
Let's hope we get lucky.

27:03.488 --> 27:05.122
Better.

27:05.190 --> 27:08.092
- But not great.
- Well, it's better than nothing.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.227
Here, drink your coffee.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.099
Thought you would appreciate
a little patriotism.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.311
What are you doing?

27:27.379 --> 27:29.279
Just tell me if anyone's coming.

27:29.347 --> 27:32.249
- You really are a criminal.
- Well, then, arrest me.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.220
This isn't gonna work.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.056
Well, you said we can't
ditch the car.

27:39.058 --> 27:43.394
They'll still be looking for a
1958 black Ford Fairlane.

27:43.396 --> 27:45.295
Look, relax, all right?
I've got a plan.

27:45.363 --> 27:49.800
Some plan. Now that the car is
clean they'll never spot us.

27:49.868 --> 27:53.470
Oh, you said something funny.
There's hope for you yet.

27:57.575 --> 27:59.443
Ah, this is perfect.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.224
- What's going on?
- You'll see.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.834
- What the hell is that?
- You know what? Will you just relax?

28:23.902 --> 28:26.570
Here. Why don't you go read
something?

28:26.572 --> 28:28.105
Jeez.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.099
Hey, why don't you grab
a can there?

29:53.658 --> 29:56.126
I was in kind
of a red mood today.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.397
I hadn't noticed.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.300
- How's he doing?
- He hasn't been violent.

30:03.368 --> 30:06.637
I mean, he's been ok. He's been
very interested in art projects.

30:06.704 --> 30:10.107
And he hasn't... He's been really
nice to the other patients.

30:10.175 --> 30:11.809
That's interesting.

30:11.876 --> 30:15.913
In my opinion, taking off those
restraints was a bad idea.

30:15.915 --> 30:20.117
- You know his history.
- All too well, Dr. Campbell, all too well.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.287
We're gonna have to watch him.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.956
His behavior is not very
convincing.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.107
Oh. Nice work, Mr. Williams.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.976
Oh, thanks, doc.

30:46.044 --> 30:50.814
You know, I feel like I'm
redefining my life in a way.

30:50.882 --> 30:52.482
Oh? How so?

30:52.484 --> 30:58.455
Well, that anger issue that I had, I'm...
I'm beginning to get a grip on that.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.792
- Tell me more.
- Well, that thing about my mother.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.562
I mean, thanks to you, now
I... I really understand it.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.066
It could have made a whole
difference in my life, but...

31:09.068 --> 31:12.269
well, never too late,
as they say.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.072
How remarkable,

31:15.074 --> 31:18.909
especially considering we've
only had one session together.

31:18.911 --> 31:22.145
Oh, yeah, yeah. Here, here.
I made that for you.

31:22.213 --> 31:27.117
Oh, look at that. Wherever did you
find an orange rabbit, Mr. Williams?

31:27.119 --> 31:29.052
Thank you.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.154
You're welcome, doctor.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.425
- You got an address for your friend?
- - No.

31:35.493 --> 31:39.630
- You don't know where he lives?
- Somewhere in this town.

31:39.697 --> 31:42.065
- You got a phone number?
- It's not listed.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.835
You mean we came all this way and
you didn't even know if he's alive?

31:44.903 --> 31:48.105
Oh, I'm pretty sure
he's still alive.

31:48.172 --> 31:52.075
Look, I got you here, right? I
held up my end of the bargain.

31:52.077 --> 31:55.746
- I've got a train to catch.
- Well, don't worry about me.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.481
Well, how do you expect
to find him?

31:57.548 --> 32:02.185
Well, he's a decorated war hero. I'm
sure everybody in town knows him.

32:02.187 --> 32:05.422
Oh, boy. All right, look,
I got an idea.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.302
A small-town bar
is better than the phone book.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.404
Can I buy you a beer?

32:20.406 --> 32:24.241
- No, thanks.
- Lighten up, will you? Live a little.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.077
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:27.079 --> 32:29.313
Two beers, whatever you got.

32:29.380 --> 32:31.248
How about a shot?

32:31.250 --> 32:32.916
Two shots of Tequila.

32:35.086 --> 32:38.088
Do you know a man
named will Hodges?

32:38.156 --> 32:40.624
Will Hodges...

32:40.692 --> 32:43.961
No, I don't believe I know him.

32:44.028 --> 32:46.763
- Do you live around here?
- No, no, I'm from out of town.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.967
You see that?
He doesn't even live here.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.103
Do you know a man
named will Hodges?

32:53.171 --> 32:56.640
Yeah, he used to come here all the time.
I haven't seen him in a while.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.777
Hey, Mike. Does will Hodges still
live behind diamond Jim's?

33:00.845 --> 33:02.946
Yeah, last I heard
he was still there.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.749
You can find him at diamond
Jim's. It's just out of town.

33:05.751 --> 33:10.253
About half a block past the train station.
Just go round the back.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.389
How about a toast?

33:13.858 --> 33:15.726
Hey, you didn't take your shot!

33:26.170 --> 33:29.406
You need me to stick around,
make sure he's here?

33:29.408 --> 33:31.975
No, no, you've done enough.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.980
Well, then, I guess
I'll get going.

33:51.896 --> 33:53.397
Hey, Romy.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.433
You gonna be ok?

33:57.602 --> 34:00.070
I'm always ok.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.628
What do you want?

34:24.695 --> 34:27.397
Will, it's me, eagle. Open up.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.300
Eagle? What do you mean,
eagle?

34:30.368 --> 34:32.302
Go away! Leave me alone.

34:32.370 --> 34:37.239
Will, we flew together during the war.
The duchess. Don't you remember?

34:37.242 --> 34:39.342
Will, open up!

34:42.947 --> 34:44.514
Will?

34:45.016 --> 34:46.449
Eagle.

34:46.516 --> 34:48.952
Morning. We're closed.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.655
- Can I help you?
- No, I was just leaving.

34:51.722 --> 34:53.757
Is that your car over there?

34:53.824 --> 34:57.227
If it belonged to me, I'd be driving it.
It's a friend of will's.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.063
Will don't have no friends.

35:00.065 --> 35:02.466
Well, he does now.

35:02.533 --> 35:05.735
That son of a bitch needs to
be cleanin' this parking lot.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.011
I can't do it, eagle.

35:15.079 --> 35:18.648
- Will, I need you.
- I'm catching a train out of here.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.785
- I got my bag packed. I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

35:21.853 --> 35:25.288
- South, where it's warm.
- We're going south.

35:25.356 --> 35:26.756
I open in two hours.

35:26.824 --> 35:31.761
I need you out there sweeping
that parking lot, you old lush!

35:31.829 --> 35:33.997
- Hey, I didn't touch you.
- - Hey!

35:37.702 --> 35:39.336
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.908
It's ok, will. She's with me.
Come on, let's get out of here.

35:44.910 --> 35:48.578
I wanted to say goodbye to Jeff.
I've never been there, you know.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.947
- What's he talking about?
- His son.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.083
Well, you know where he is?

35:53.085 --> 35:56.553
Yeah. You feel like driving?

35:58.523 --> 35:59.756
Yeah.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.892
Come on, let's go.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.995
Hey, he's gotta pay me back

36:05.062 --> 36:07.130
for that liquor
he stole from me.

36:07.198 --> 36:08.765
The man's paid enough.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.736
Listen here, you little white-trash
whore, this is between me and will.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.338
What was that?

36:16.941 --> 36:20.577
Shooting two people in 24 hours
might draw some attention.

36:20.579 --> 36:23.680
I swore I'd kill the next man
that talked to me like that.

36:23.748 --> 36:27.017
There will always be
rats in this world, Romy.

36:27.019 --> 36:29.052
Doesn't mean
we have to kill 'em all.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.657
Bummer.

36:33.724 --> 36:36.459
All right, you need anything
out of your trailer?

36:36.527 --> 36:39.996
I got a little package
on the bed.

36:40.064 --> 36:44.334
- Oh, and there's... there's that bag.
- All right, you take him to the car.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.170
- You, get in.
- What?

36:47.238 --> 36:50.607
You know, you might
wanna find something to read.

36:50.675 --> 36:53.910
Oh!
Smells like old man's shit.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.012
Mangy dog!

37:05.990 --> 37:09.326
Oh, it stinks.
Let me out of here!

37:17.068 --> 37:21.137
- How's he doing?
- He's sleeping it off.

37:23.107 --> 37:25.508
It's good to have friends,
you know?

37:26.577 --> 37:31.481
- I've never known anyone for very long.
- Oh, you're still young.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.751
Yeah, I haven't been young
for a very long time.

37:34.819 --> 37:38.922
I'm afraid I'll be an old woman with
my past still chasing after me.

37:38.990 --> 37:42.959
Your past will be your future
if you keep running from it.

37:45.162 --> 37:46.997
Is that what happened to you?

37:47.598 --> 37:51.301
I never ran from anything...
Until now.

37:55.740 --> 37:59.142
Will? Will, wake up.
We're here.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.586
Easy.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.721
Whoa. I got you.

38:13.824 --> 38:15.892
Easy.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.499
Oh, it's right over this way.

38:23.267 --> 38:27.270
- I need a drink.
- You're ok. I'm here for you.

38:29.874 --> 38:31.741
How did you get like this?

38:31.743 --> 38:35.412
Life didn't quite turn out
the way I expected.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.147
Why didn't you let someone know?

38:37.214 --> 38:40.016
We could have helped.
I could have done something.

38:40.018 --> 38:42.952
What could you have done,
or anyone for that matter?

38:45.489 --> 38:50.093
We waited for Jeff to come
home for 30 years.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.396
Ella never gave up hope.

38:54.198 --> 38:56.466
It finally killed her.

38:56.534 --> 38:59.669
After she died,
I gave up on everything.

39:00.504 --> 39:07.243
A few bad decisions later, I found
myself living behind a bar.

39:07.245 --> 39:12.082
Or under one, if I had enough
money in my pocket.

39:16.687 --> 39:21.057
58,000 just seems like a number until
you put a name to each one of these.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.294
Here he is. 37e.

39:34.405 --> 39:36.473
Here he is.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.066
My boy.

40:39.069 --> 40:44.974
Jeff was shot down over Hanoi
and went missing in 1972.

40:45.042 --> 40:47.444
Will blamed himself.

40:47.511 --> 40:49.579
Why did he blame himself?

40:50.614 --> 40:55.318
Jeff volunteered for one of
those secret suicide missions.

40:55.320 --> 40:59.155
He died trying to be the hero
his father was.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.440
Good night, grandpa.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.943
Taylor, are you asleep?

41:24.014 --> 41:25.582
Are you still mad at me and mom?

41:25.649 --> 41:27.884
Are you and mom
getting a divorce?

41:27.886 --> 41:29.452
Why would you ask that?

41:29.520 --> 41:31.488
- Well, are you?
- No.

41:31.555 --> 41:34.824
If you and mom ever get a divorce,
I'd wanna live with grandpa.

41:34.892 --> 41:38.461
- Then I could take care of him.
- Taylor, we're your parents.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.063
It's our job
to take care of you.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.499
- I'm not a job, dad.
- I didn't mean it that way.

41:42.566 --> 41:45.602
You and mom act like it's a
job having grandpa live here.

41:45.669 --> 41:47.937
- I never said that.
- It's the way you act.

41:48.005 --> 41:50.440
You never listen
to either one of us.

41:53.344 --> 41:56.913
I think it's time to get
some sleep. Good night.

42:00.217 --> 42:04.754
Hey, Taylor, are you sure you
don't know where grandpa is?

42:04.822 --> 42:06.556
Good night, dad.

42:16.767 --> 42:18.835
Did you talk with Taylor?

42:20.070 --> 42:22.906
- He resents us.
- No, he doesn't.

42:22.908 --> 42:26.442
Oh, yes, he does,
and so does dad.

42:26.510 --> 42:29.245
That's why they spend
so much time together.

42:29.247 --> 42:31.614
They have a common enemy, us.

42:33.484 --> 42:35.952
Dad spends more time with him.

42:38.022 --> 42:40.757
Didn't spend a lot of time
with me when I was a kid.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.093
And now I'm doing the same
thing with Taylor.

42:46.363 --> 42:48.431
It's not too late
to change that.

43:00.611 --> 43:05.114
Hey, Romy, I really appreciate
you helping us out like this.

43:05.883 --> 43:09.719
If you wanna take off,
I understand.

43:09.721 --> 43:13.456
I'm starting to have some fun. Think
I'll stick around for a little while.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.761
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:20.164 --> 43:22.932
I'm actually learning a little
something from you old farts.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.178
Morning, will.

43:39.183 --> 43:41.317
Coffee.

43:41.385 --> 43:45.888
I need... a little something
added, if you know what I mean.

43:45.890 --> 43:48.625
Cream or sugar?

43:48.692 --> 43:53.062
- That's not what I had in mind.
- It's all you're gonna get from me.

43:55.165 --> 43:57.233
- Breakfast.

43:58.168 --> 44:00.236
These your glasses?

44:02.573 --> 44:03.940
Oh, damn.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.744
I brought you some things.

44:18.055 --> 44:19.222
Use it.

44:22.826 --> 44:27.797
Thought you might wanna get cleaned
up and look like a real airman.

44:32.870 --> 44:36.906
Mr. Pernell, this is special
agent blessings with the FBI.

44:36.908 --> 44:40.743
We have confirmed that your
father was not kidnapped.

44:40.745 --> 44:42.979
Thank god. You found him?

44:44.081 --> 44:46.783
Agent blessings needs to ask
you some questions.

44:46.850 --> 44:50.553
Did your father make a lot of phone
calls prior to his disappearance?

44:50.555 --> 44:54.123
- Not that I'm aware of.
- We need a copy of your phone records.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.258
What for?

44:55.325 --> 44:58.428
Did he disappear
for periods of time?

44:59.096 --> 45:00.496
What is this about?

45:00.564 --> 45:03.099
Has he been
to Atlantic city recently?

45:03.167 --> 45:04.934
How would it get there? No.

45:05.002 --> 45:08.604
- Does your father have a female friend?
- Definitely not.

45:08.672 --> 45:14.844
Mr. Pernell, your father, his
female accomplice and another man

45:14.912 --> 45:19.482
allegedly beat and robbed the owner of a
dance hall in Pennsylvania last night.

45:19.484 --> 45:20.583
What?

45:20.585 --> 45:23.252
We have a positive ID on a woman
that he was traveling with.

45:24.021 --> 45:25.922
Who is she?

45:26.757 --> 45:28.725
It's not good.

45:29.426 --> 45:32.261
Well, what do you think?

45:34.164 --> 45:36.232
Hey, there, handsome.

45:36.234 --> 45:39.302
- You don't mind if we take a look inside?
- No, go ahead. Be my guest.

45:39.369 --> 45:42.004
Cops have already been here. They
went through the whole place.

45:42.072 --> 45:43.806
I don't think you're gonna
find anything.

45:55.819 --> 45:57.320
Ugh. Man, it reeks in here.

45:57.387 --> 45:59.055
I'm gonna wait for you outside.

46:18.909 --> 46:20.977
Think I got something.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.417
Do you recognize anyone
in this picture?

46:29.219 --> 46:31.754
Yeah, well, that's will.

46:31.822 --> 46:36.659
Oh... that's the guy
that he ran off with.

46:37.394 --> 46:39.562
You don't mind if I hang on to
this, do you?

46:39.564 --> 46:41.731
No, I don't have any
use for it. Take it.

46:41.733 --> 46:43.833
How's a photograph
gonna help us?

46:45.602 --> 46:49.305
This is a squadron number
and the name of the bomber.

46:49.373 --> 46:52.508
Now all we need is a little
help from uncle Sam.

46:52.576 --> 46:55.478
- Thank you, diamond Jim.
- No problem. Good luck to you.

46:55.546 --> 46:57.980
Not bad.

46:57.982 --> 47:01.484
Did you stay in touch with the
guys after the last reunion?

47:01.552 --> 47:03.986
- No.
- What about Grady reeds?

47:04.054 --> 47:05.755
You guys were close.

47:05.823 --> 47:11.093
We were, but he wrote me a few
times, I never wrote back.

47:11.161 --> 47:14.564
Hmm. Does he still live
in Wichita, Kansas?

47:14.566 --> 47:17.567
- Far as I know.
- - I wanna find him.

47:17.569 --> 47:21.304
Great. If he's not blind or drunk, maybe
he can help out with the driving.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.428
Do these places serve booze?

47:45.495 --> 47:47.563
I've never known
one that didn't.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.967
This might not be a good idea.

47:51.034 --> 47:54.570
Look, my butt is killing me.
I need to get out of this car.

47:55.439 --> 47:57.640
What about will?

47:57.708 --> 48:00.843
- I saw that!
- I need you to stay straight.

48:00.911 --> 48:02.645
I'll be all right!

48:02.713 --> 48:06.249
Will is the only person that can
make a decision about his drinking.

48:06.251 --> 48:08.384
I knew I liked this girl.

48:23.267 --> 48:24.967
Wh... what's this?

48:25.669 --> 48:27.970
A Martini.

48:28.038 --> 48:32.008
- What, you've never had one?
- I'm not much of a drinker.

48:32.075 --> 48:33.910
Try it. It'll take the edge
off.

48:39.082 --> 48:41.150
Mm. Mm!

48:43.186 --> 48:45.254
Here. Take a bite.

48:45.656 --> 48:48.257
- Oh!
- What's wrong?

48:48.325 --> 48:49.926
I hate olives.

48:51.862 --> 48:53.963
Well, I guess it's
an acquired taste.

48:59.002 --> 49:01.470
I was a kid when this song
first came out.

49:02.239 --> 49:04.440
When was the last time you
danced?

49:04.508 --> 49:06.642
With my wife.

49:07.945 --> 49:11.013
- How long were you guys married?
- 56 years.

49:11.015 --> 49:13.115
Wow.

49:13.884 --> 49:15.918
You just wear that ring
out of habit?

49:15.986 --> 49:22.224
No. We were kids when we got married and
we didn't have money for wedding rings.

49:22.226 --> 49:25.328
She took an extra job,
saved her money.

49:26.063 --> 49:29.131
Sent this to me
when I was overseas.

49:29.199 --> 49:32.735
It hasn't been off my finger
since the day I put it on.

49:33.437 --> 49:36.405
In all that time, did you ever
cheat on her?

49:36.407 --> 49:38.607
Real men don't cheat.

49:40.043 --> 49:41.644
I worked in a casino
in Atlantic city,

49:41.712 --> 49:45.614
and I'd watch men
go upstairs with their wives

49:45.616 --> 49:48.551
and then head right downstairs
and look for a date.

49:48.553 --> 49:50.786
I don't even think
they considered it cheating.

49:50.854 --> 49:53.756
It was just sex for sport,
you know, like recreational.

49:54.925 --> 49:57.827
I could never disgrace my wife
like that.

49:59.229 --> 50:02.565
There's not a day goes by
that I don't think of her.

50:08.271 --> 50:10.306
You're a good man, eagle.

50:12.509 --> 50:14.176
Come on.

50:14.244 --> 50:16.479
- What?
- Dance with me.

50:23.053 --> 50:25.454
Who was the man in the suit?

50:26.390 --> 50:30.326
Another black-hearted man
who only cares about his money

50:30.394 --> 50:33.295
and, well, who he can
buy with it.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.431
What were you doing with him?

50:36.533 --> 50:41.404
I felt safe with him, until I
realized how dangerous he was.

50:41.406 --> 50:44.240
God, why can't I just find
a decent man, huh?

50:45.175 --> 50:47.743
Maybe you're looking in all
the wrong places.

50:48.345 --> 50:49.645
Yeah.

50:53.750 --> 50:56.719
Every once in a while
god hands us a rose.

50:57.587 --> 51:00.589
And he handed me one
the day I met you.

51:02.325 --> 51:06.328
That is... the nicest thing that
anyone has ever said to me.

51:09.699 --> 51:13.569
You know, I've... been meaning
to thank you.

51:13.571 --> 51:16.005
For what?

51:16.073 --> 51:18.407
For showing me what a real man
can be like.

52:00.851 --> 52:02.918
You all right?

52:03.720 --> 52:07.623
I still hear them sometimes.
Do you?

52:07.691 --> 52:09.058
Yeah.

52:09.060 --> 52:11.460
Always the same faces.

52:12.863 --> 52:15.297
I'm sorry
I didn't stay in touch.

52:15.365 --> 52:17.433
I owe you my life.

52:17.501 --> 52:19.502
Oh, that's ok.

52:19.569 --> 52:24.106
Pete has cursed me every day
of his life for saving him.

52:25.675 --> 52:27.743
It wasn't your fault.

52:28.245 --> 52:30.679
They shouldn't have given me
a medal for it.

52:36.353 --> 52:38.454
That's an old Stearman.

52:55.105 --> 52:57.806
The first plane I ever flew
was a Stearman.

52:57.874 --> 52:59.909
When's the last time you flew?

52:59.911 --> 53:01.310
With you.

53:01.378 --> 53:04.480
- You think you could still do it?
- Like riding a bicycle.

53:16.359 --> 53:18.460
- Hey there.
- You need something?

53:18.528 --> 53:21.897
- Is this your plane?
- Uh... kind of. My daddy.

53:21.899 --> 53:24.333
Well, I would love it if these
two gentlemen over here

53:24.401 --> 53:25.935
could take it up
for a few minutes.

53:26.002 --> 53:28.737
Oh, I'm sure you would.
One of them a pilot?

53:28.739 --> 53:31.473
- Yeah, they both are.
- You know what kind of plane this is?

53:31.541 --> 53:33.576
Uh, according to them,
it's a Stearman.

53:33.578 --> 53:36.278
- That's right.
- Well, you haven't heard the best part.

53:36.280 --> 53:37.913
What's that gonna be, I wonder?

53:39.849 --> 53:43.552
- How you feeling?
- Oh, never felt better.

53:44.354 --> 53:48.424
You gotta get sober. Check into
the Va or do whatever it takes.

53:48.491 --> 53:52.494
I'll add that to my list of
things to do before I die.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.997
All right, boys,
you get to go up.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.298
What are you talking about?

53:56.366 --> 53:57.600
It's your lucky day, gentlemen.

53:57.602 --> 54:00.269
- He's gonna let will fly the plane.
- Why not me? I'm the captain.

54:00.337 --> 54:02.438
I'm worried about your eyesight.

54:02.505 --> 54:06.008
- Try not to dump it, all right?
- Ok. I learned to fly in one of these.

54:06.076 --> 54:09.478
Ok, do your flight check.
Have fun.

54:12.882 --> 54:17.152
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. Pretty sure.

54:18.855 --> 54:20.956
You know you don't have
anything to prove?

54:21.024 --> 54:27.296
What's wrong? You afraid I might
show you up in front of Romy?

54:34.037 --> 54:37.239
Full throttle, will.
Full throttle!

54:38.908 --> 54:41.944
Get her up! Get her up!

54:42.012 --> 54:44.246
We're not getting air speed!

54:44.248 --> 54:45.748
I know!

54:45.815 --> 54:48.250
Are you sure they know what
they're doing?

54:49.052 --> 54:51.920
- Get it up.
- I'm trying! I'm trying!

54:57.861 --> 55:00.429
Shut her down. Shut her down!

55:00.497 --> 55:02.464
Oh, my god.

55:06.036 --> 55:09.905
My father's gonna kill me!
Jesus Christ!

55:18.082 --> 55:19.915
Are you guys ok?
Anything hurt?

55:19.983 --> 55:22.584
- Only my pride.
- I should have flown.

55:22.652 --> 55:25.220
You can't even drive.

55:25.222 --> 55:27.723
- That thing's a total loss.
- I'll take care of it.

55:27.725 --> 55:30.092
Gonna cost you a lot more than
that ten grand you gave me.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.629
- I said I'll take care of it.
- Where's all this money coming from?

55:33.697 --> 55:37.599
I got a little money stashed away. Right,
well, that was quite an experience.

55:37.667 --> 55:40.302
Why don't you... why don't you
guys go take a walk, all right?

55:40.370 --> 55:42.604
And I'll settle up
with this gentleman.

55:43.173 --> 55:46.408
What's so funny?

55:46.410 --> 55:49.144
- I thought they could fly.
- Did you?

55:49.212 --> 55:51.347
Well, hey, at least no one died.

55:52.048 --> 55:54.116
Not yet.

56:00.223 --> 56:01.990
Ok.

56:04.194 --> 56:07.596
So I checked it out. There's only
four of these guys left alive, right?

56:07.664 --> 56:11.500
You got John Pernell, new Jersey.
That's the guy who's picked up Romy.

56:11.568 --> 56:16.338
Will Hodges, Pennsylvania.
Grady reeds, Kansas.

56:16.406 --> 56:18.807
Pete Williams in Texas.

56:18.875 --> 56:25.280
Which means next destination...
Wichita, Kansas.

56:26.349 --> 56:28.117
Book a flight.

56:32.021 --> 56:34.590
Does Grady reeds live here?

56:34.657 --> 56:38.293
He's in a retirement home.
I'm his son James.

56:38.361 --> 56:41.230
Well, we're old friends of his
from the army air corps.

56:41.831 --> 56:44.666
That would have been my guess
since it isn't Halloween.

56:44.734 --> 56:47.436
- Is he well?
- He's ok, I guess.

56:47.504 --> 56:50.439
- I haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.
- We need the address.

56:50.507 --> 56:54.309
He's in the golden age retirement home.
It's on the other side of town.

56:55.245 --> 56:57.312
Thanks.

57:00.183 --> 57:03.118
Excuse me. We're looking for
Grady reeds' room.

57:03.186 --> 57:06.255
Take hall C, room 75.

57:06.322 --> 57:09.725
- Visiting hours are almost over.
- No, that's ok, that's ok.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.060
- Go ahead. Y'all can go.
- All right, thank you.

57:12.062 --> 57:13.162
Ok, will.

57:15.231 --> 57:17.766
I'm not hungry. Go away.
Thank you.

57:18.902 --> 57:20.969
Who the hell...?

57:22.505 --> 57:24.573
Grady, it's eagle.

57:26.342 --> 57:29.244
- What do you want?
- He doesn't even recognize us.

57:29.246 --> 57:32.481
Grady, look at me. It's eagle.

57:33.349 --> 57:35.451
- Eagle?
- Yeah.

57:35.518 --> 57:38.787
- Is it really you?
- Yeah, and look who I brought with me.

57:39.589 --> 57:42.958
Will. My god! Will!

57:43.026 --> 57:45.627
What in the Sam hill blue
blazes...?

57:46.262 --> 57:49.832
Wait a minute. I thought you
guys were dead.

57:49.899 --> 57:51.800
Must be someone else.

57:51.868 --> 57:53.669
Well, how did you find me?

57:53.736 --> 57:56.672
- Your son.
- That good-for-nothin'.

57:56.739 --> 58:00.175
- He stole my house.
- Doesn't look too lively around here.

58:00.243 --> 58:05.681
- What do you do all day?
- Well, I mostly sit and look at books.

58:05.683 --> 58:09.818
The rest of them watch TV all day and
grow into vegetables, but not me.

58:09.886 --> 58:12.721
We're on our way to Galveston
to see Pete.

58:12.723 --> 58:16.058
- You like to come with us?
- I can't.

58:16.060 --> 58:20.562
My son put me in here. He said
I'm crazy. Do I look crazy?

58:20.564 --> 58:23.165
- Not to me.
- Well, they won't believe me.

58:23.233 --> 58:27.069
- I couldn't fight my way out of here.
- Maybe you could walk out of here.

58:27.071 --> 58:29.905
And get past that nurse
from the green bay packers?

58:30.673 --> 58:32.241
Yeah. I got a plan.

58:34.911 --> 58:36.979
Who is she?

58:41.818 --> 58:43.919
Ready?

58:43.987 --> 58:46.488
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

58:46.556 --> 58:48.123
I'm ready.

58:48.191 --> 58:51.593
Will, count to ten and then run.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.316
Hold it right there, buster.

59:15.718 --> 59:17.486
Now, wait a minute.

59:25.995 --> 59:27.262
Mr. reeds!

59:33.536 --> 59:35.304
When are we stopping?

59:35.371 --> 59:38.307
Thought I'd drive all night.
We should be in Oklahoma soon.

59:38.374 --> 59:40.943
If you see a liquor store,
pull in.

59:41.010 --> 59:42.978
Why do you want a drink?

59:42.980 --> 59:44.913
Because I'm an alcoholic.

59:44.981 --> 59:46.949
Sounds like
a good enough reason.

59:47.016 --> 59:49.284
He's upset
because we crashed the plane.

59:49.352 --> 59:51.553
It's just an excuse
for him to drink.

59:51.555 --> 59:54.756
It's a good enough reason
for me, not that I need one.

59:54.824 --> 59:56.825
You guys crashed a plane?

59:56.893 --> 59:59.094
Never got off the ground.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:03.432
I was scared. I froze.

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.736
Will, I was scared too.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:17.279
Well, we just missed them. But
I do know where they're going.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:45.507
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me?

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.744
Nothing. It's just every time
you show up, there's bad news.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:53.315
Well, I'm afraid I have
some bad news.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:57.419
Yeah. Hang on.
He just rolled in.

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:02.424
I have a detective coats on
the line from New Jersey,

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.493
wants to ask you a few
questions.

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.794
I didn't do it.

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:09.931
Go ahead, detective coats.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:13.635
Mr. Williams, I am investigating the
whereabouts of a friend of yours,

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:14.936
Mr. John Pernell.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.674
Have you had contact with him
recently?

01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:22.477
John Pernell... no, he hasn't.

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:25.981
Well, I understand that you...
You sent him a letter.

01:01:26.049 --> 01:01:29.751
- Yep.
- Did you ask him to come to Galveston?

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.386
No.

01:01:31.388 --> 01:01:34.423
Can you think of any reason
why he would have run away?

01:01:36.092 --> 01:01:38.827
Maybe he didn't like the food.

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:42.297
Thank you, Mr. Williams.

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:46.268
Uh, Dr. Darby, if they show up there,
would you be in contact with me, please?

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:48.970
- We'll be on the lookout.
- Bye now.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.406
Get him out of here.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:02:00.382
Yeah, there's some major
manipulation going on here.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.586
You think?

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.812
Grady!

01:02:36.519 --> 01:02:38.220
Huh? Oh.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.927
Grady, it's ok. Let's go in.

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:54.770
Grady, you almost got killed
just now.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:58.340
- What's wrong with you?
- Can't you see what's wrong?

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.642
Look at him. He's gone.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.511
I haven't gone anywhere.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.813
What are we gonna do now?

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:07.415
We're gonna get him dressed.

01:03:16.926 --> 01:03:22.063
I was afraid of this. His last few
letters didn't make much sense.

01:03:22.065 --> 01:03:23.932
Did he have a stroke
or something?

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.101
Alzheimer's.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:29.271
In the beginning
they go in and out like this.

01:03:30.206 --> 01:03:31.940
So what are we gonna do
with him?

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.576
We'll figure it out
when we get there.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.388
- John?
- Dad?

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:49.391
- Where the hell are you?
- I just called to tell you I'm ok.

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:53.261
Oh, no, no, believe me, you're not ok.
You're in big trouble.

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:55.764
That girl you're with
is wanted for armed robbery.

01:03:55.832 --> 01:03:57.265
What are you talking about?

01:03:57.333 --> 01:04:00.435
Not to mention assault with a
deadly weapon on a state trooper.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:03.104
- I'll call you back.
- No, dad, wait.

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:05.774
We want you to know that...

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:07.576
that we're very worried
about you.

01:04:07.578 --> 01:04:08.677
I'll be ok.

01:04:08.679 --> 01:04:12.047
We can get this whole thing cleared up
if you just tell me what's going on.

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:14.716
I can't right now. Tell Taylor
I love him.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:16.451
Hey, dad...

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.587
I love you.

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.722
I love you too, son.

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.293
What was that about?

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.163
- You are a criminal.
- What?

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.898
- Yeah, this is what.
- Excuse me.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.734
She robbed a man in New Jersey
and shot him.

01:04:32.736 --> 01:04:34.402
That was in self-defense!

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:37.806
She also robbed your boss. It's a
wonder she hasn't stolen from us.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.741
- She didn't steal from my boss.
- What?

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:41.743
- I did.
- Why?

01:04:41.745 --> 01:04:44.613
I was in hell. I was making my
escape when you came along.

01:04:44.615 --> 01:04:47.082
- You're better than that.
- No. No, I'm not.

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:49.217
- You're a decorated war hero.
- Stop it.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:51.319
A goddamn medal
doesn't make a man.

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:53.455
Look at me.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:57.225
I'm not a hero. I'm a bum!

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:17.979
Romy, I'm... I'm sorry.

01:05:18.047 --> 01:05:22.384
- I took that money to start a new life.
- How much did you take?

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:24.819
A little over 600,000.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:27.756
That's a pretty good start on
a new life.

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:30.125
He and his father skim money
from one of the casinos

01:05:30.192 --> 01:05:33.929
and then launder it
through Joe's car company.

01:05:33.996 --> 01:05:37.766
They used me as a mule to get the
money from the casino to Joe.

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:41.002
He found out that I was
stealing from him.

01:05:42.538 --> 01:05:46.174
He tried to kill me. That's when
we got in the car accident.

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:48.443
So they're after you?

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:52.580
I think they're...
Like after us.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.617
Great.

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:59.788
Look, if anything happens to me,

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:02.724
I've hidden $500,000
in the spare tire well,

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:08.663
another 100,000 in my money belt
and, well, the rest is in my bag.

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:11.232
Ok? Now you know everything.

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:15.270
Thanks for sharing.

01:06:26.682 --> 01:06:28.984
I think I got it figured out.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.554
Yes, it is. What?

01:06:33.656 --> 01:06:35.824
No, there must be some mistake.

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.959
Our son's asleep.

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:41.062
Hold on, please.

01:06:46.869 --> 01:06:49.270
John, he's gone.

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.642
John Pernell. You called about
my boy?

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.778
He's right over there.

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.785
Thank you.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.154
What are you doing here?

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:08.289
You know where grandpa is.

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:17.432
It's ok.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.638
Ok.

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.654
Oh, god.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.124
You want me to drive?

01:07:43.192 --> 01:07:45.593
Uh, no, it's all right.
Thank you, though.

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.396
They're right behind us,
you know.

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:52.167
- Who?
- All the people that wanna stop us.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.936
They wanna take everything
and just throw us away.

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:58.406
- Yeah, tell me about it.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.275
What are you so happy about?

01:08:00.342 --> 01:08:02.677
I got the last laugh.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:06.114
My son thought he was so smart
locking me away.

01:08:06.182 --> 01:08:08.249
Well, I showed him.

01:08:09.251 --> 01:08:12.253
Hey, I've been here before.

01:08:12.321 --> 01:08:13.488
What is this?

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.925
After the war. This is where
they all landed.

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.117
I wanna fly again.

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:49.090
Where are we?

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.759
Will, keep an eye on him.

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:03.337
- What is this?
- Oh, all these old planes had names.

01:09:03.404 --> 01:09:05.907
They had the artwork to go
with 'em.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:08.609
- What was yours?
- The duchess.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:10.944
- Oh.
- Boy, she was a beaut.

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:14.716
When all these planes were
flying, it was a glorious sight.

01:09:16.719 --> 01:09:18.319
Why is this trip so important
to you?

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:23.424
I mean, I know you're not looking for
answers to all of life's big questions.

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:26.995
I'm just looking back on life and
wondering where it all went.

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:30.999
I'm a relic. I got old
and fear moved in.

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:34.435
Fear that I can't
live like I used to.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:39.107
Fear that something'll happen to those
that I... I love and hold dear.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:43.444
This trip is important.
We're together again.

01:09:43.912 --> 01:09:46.814
And we got one last thing to do.

01:09:47.683 --> 01:09:49.317
And what's that?

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:51.986
Eagle. Eagle,
I couldn't find him.

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:54.489
I turned round and he was gone.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.624
Hey, look. Look. There he is.

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:01.329
Grady!

01:10:01.397 --> 01:10:02.897
Grady!

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:12.106
Grady?

01:10:19.815 --> 01:10:21.282
Grady?

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.929
Grady?

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:36.464
Eagle.

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:38.433
Eagle.

01:10:44.039 --> 01:10:45.506
Grady?

01:10:46.275 --> 01:10:48.509
This is where I belong.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:52.480
You remember, eagle,
when we flew?

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.615
Yeah.

01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.717
I wanna fly again.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.721
I know, but now's
not the right time.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.990
Let me help you out of here.

01:11:03.559 --> 01:11:05.627
And I'm tired, eagle.

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:08.630
I'm so tired.

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:13.134
I know. We're all tired,
Grady.

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:15.103
Let me get you out of here.

01:11:15.938 --> 01:11:18.606
- We're coming out.
- Is he ok?

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:20.808
- All right.
- Guys, we're in trouble.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.677
Police. Come on, let's go!

01:11:31.186 --> 01:11:33.988
We've come too far. Too far.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.798
Whatever you do, don't stop.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.241
Whoo!

01:12:12.695 --> 01:12:13.995
- Oh...
- Ok, grab him.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.834
Come on, Grady, stay with us.

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:27.275
Come on, Grady. Come on!

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:34.315
Come on, Grady. Come on!

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.751
Come on.

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:43.057
Romy, he's dead, honey.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:54.068
I never figured it would get
out of hand like this.

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:58.072
- What do you wanna do now?
- Turn ourselves in.

01:12:58.074 --> 01:12:59.507
What about Pete?

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:04.345
What about him? We've got
serious problems here.

01:13:04.347 --> 01:13:06.280
It's still our responsibility.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:08.549
To who? To the corps?

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:10.785
We're all that's
left of the corps.

01:13:10.853 --> 01:13:13.121
Pete may be dead
for all we know.

01:13:13.188 --> 01:13:16.290
What's the worst that could
happen, huh? Prison?

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.826
Where do you think we were
before this trip started?

01:13:18.894 --> 01:13:22.063
Well, then, what do you
propose we do?

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:27.402
- I say we bury him.
- What? We can't do that.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:30.004
- Why not?
- It's not proper.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:32.240
The last thing he said tonight
was, "don't stop."

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:33.775
Right. He wouldn't
want us to quit.

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:36.411
He wouldn't want us to leave him
out here in this desert either.

01:13:36.413 --> 01:13:39.881
He'd rather be out here than in a funeral
home with his son looking down on him.

01:13:39.883 --> 01:13:44.218
It's not the right thing to do. You
can't just bury people in the desert.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.623
Remember what you said to me earlier
tonight? About not being afraid?

01:13:49.324 --> 01:13:52.994
We've come too far
to turn back now.

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:01.936
All right.

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.673
We bury him.

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:13.147
All I know is, he was a good
man and a great bombardier.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:18.119
If anyone can find their way
to heaven, he can.

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:25.726
And with god as your commanding officer,
you finally got your wings back.

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:37.839
See you on the other side,
old friend.

01:14:53.889 --> 01:14:56.724
All this over a bottle of wine?

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:59.594
They survived 30 missions and
a major plane crash together.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.063
The wine is just a symbol of
their survival.

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:04.165
It's called the last man club.

01:15:06.268 --> 01:15:07.335
I gotta go.

01:15:07.337 --> 01:15:09.804
- I'll see you in a couple of days.
- Dad, I'm going with you.

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.939
Oh, Taylor, no.

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.812
Goodbye.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.948
Come on, let's go find grandpa.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.856
Pete is playing us for fools. His
friends were seen in Texas last night.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:26.888
They're on their way here, most
likely to get him, and he knows it.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.390
I'm sending him to the state
sanitarium immediately.

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:31.259
He doesn't belong in there
and you know it.

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:34.228
Yeah? Well,
he's leaving this afternoon.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:53.447
I am so sorry. I did
everything I could.

01:15:53.515 --> 01:15:55.583
I know you did.

01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:03.057
You can wear your bathrobe.

01:16:03.059 --> 01:16:05.560
Nobody cares what
you look like over there.

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.429
No.

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:14.235
If I'm going there,
they're gonna know who I was.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:28.115
Detectives.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.721
Mr. Pernell.
Mind if we tag along?

01:16:33.723 --> 01:16:36.958
- Detective, how did you know I...?
- Next time take a direct flight.

01:16:37.025 --> 01:16:41.295
This is detective Lee, Galveston pd,
and I think you know agent blessings.

01:16:41.363 --> 01:16:43.331
Any questions?

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:44.665
Why don't you come with us?

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:59.814
I would like to go the way
Grady did.

01:16:59.881 --> 01:17:03.117
One minute you're here,
the next minute...

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:04.819
We should be so lucky.

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.455
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:17:09.257 --> 01:17:13.127
I feel like we fought for a country
that no longer belongs to us.

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:16.130
It doesn't.
It belongs to them.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.566
The poor bastards.

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:22.570
Have you given any thought to what
we're going to do after this?

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:27.475
- I'm not going to an old folks' home.
- And I'm not going back to that trailer.

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:32.546
So, what are we going to do?

01:17:34.082 --> 01:17:35.716
We stick together.

01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:45.793
- Did you see that?
- Turn in!

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:05.613
- Isn't that a sight?
- Huh.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.249
What would you give to fly one
again?

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:11.652
- Everything.

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:15.122
Let's go get Pete.

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:23.297
What's on your mind?

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:26.333
What's gonna happen to grandpa
when we find him?

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:30.004
Well, once we get this mess cleared
up, we'll take him home with us.

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.640
Then what?

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:35.109
Well, that will be up
to your grandfather.

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:43.451
You could get a ticket for this.

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:49.123
After all the laws we broke, you're
worried about a parking ticket?

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.962
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:57.064
Mental ward? Pete has
a mental problem?

01:18:57.066 --> 01:19:00.234
Well, our last mission
we took a lot of flack.

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:05.439
We survived the crash, but Pete was
sitting directly over the explosion

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:08.342
and it took off everything
between his legs.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.812
He lost his mind over it.

01:19:15.984 --> 01:19:18.085
Are y'all looking
for Pete Williams?

01:19:18.987 --> 01:19:21.322
- Yeah.
- Everyone is looking for you.

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.891
- Police are on the property.
- We wanna see Pete.

01:19:23.893 --> 01:19:25.559
We've come a long way.

01:19:25.561 --> 01:19:28.896
Well, he's in the south wing,
room 152.

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.998
They're transferring him to
another facility.

01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:33.134
- You'll have to hurry.
- Thanks.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.415
- - Hey,
who the heck are you guys?

01:19:48.483 --> 01:19:49.950
Will?

01:19:50.018 --> 01:19:52.553
Eagle! I can't believe it.

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:55.456
Pete, you look great.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.591
I don't feel great.

01:19:58.927 --> 01:20:02.997
They're taking me out of here.
They're gonna lock me away.

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:05.499
Not if anybody can do anything
about it.

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:09.503
- Really?
- We came to get you.

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.573
- We did?
- There's been a change in plan.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:16.010
- I didn't know we had a plan.
- Who's she?

01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:18.879
- Romy.
- What kind of name is that?

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:21.549
- Where you taking him? Nurse!
- Settle down. Settle down.

01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:23.284
- Nurse!
- Settle down.

01:20:23.351 --> 01:20:24.451
- Nurse!
- Hold him, will.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:27.955
Help me! What are you doing?
Let go of me!

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.261
You guys going out
for some fresh air?

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.930
Yeah.

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:38.599
Come back in a few minutes.

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.302
Thank you, Ripley.

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.673
Cops! Is there
another way out?

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.141
- Back that way.
- Ok.

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:49.610
Where do you think you're going?
That man's in my custody.

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:53.080
- Take your hand off that wheelchair.
- Get your hands off me!

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.984
- I knew that'd come in handy.
- - Let's go.

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.258
Hey! Come on, here!

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.397
Lee, what is going on here?

01:21:13.568 --> 01:21:15.903
Agent Hanks, what's your 20?

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:18.005
- That should do it.
- All right.

01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.484
Hey!

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.420
Perfect.

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:36.056
- I'll drive.
- What?

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.658
Get in.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:39.927
- I think I'd better...
- Get in!

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:47.501
- Keep them in the hall.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.382
Damn, I always
wanted to do that!

01:22:01.384 --> 01:22:04.218
Whoa. Whoo.

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:07.054
- Their car is gone.
- What?

01:22:07.056 --> 01:22:09.590
Lee, we're not chasing
Bonnie and Clyde here.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.959
These guys are senior
citizens, for god's sake.

01:22:12.761 --> 01:22:14.828
What are we doing?

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:28.475
We're stealing a plane?

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.914
This is one ride
you can't go on.

01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:45.826
Romy.

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:49.129
I want you to have this.

01:22:49.197 --> 01:22:51.565
- I can't.
- Please?

01:22:51.567 --> 01:22:54.668
You're a lot braver
than I ever was.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.077
I want you to have
my wife's car.

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:07.414
I put the title in the glove
compartment and signed it over to you.

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:10.150
You love that car.
What's going on?

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:13.387
We have one last mission,
remember?

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:17.257
Stay with me.
I'll take care of you.

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:20.661
You can't be burdened
taking care of an old man.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.564
Sometimes in life
god hands us a rose, remember?

01:23:23.566 --> 01:23:27.001
Yeah, but I want you to have
the whole garden.

01:23:38.213 --> 01:23:40.581
Ever hear from her again?

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.649
No.

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:48.088
Oh, I don't blame her.
She wanted children and...

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:51.625
I couldn't give 'em to her.

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.761
Oh, I'm sorry, Pete.

01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:59.133
No, I'm sorry, will.

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.771
I'm sorry I never thanked you
for saving my life.

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.305
Oh...

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.275
Just like the old days, Pete.

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:11.445
Read 'em to me.

01:24:11.513 --> 01:24:13.213
Gear switch, neutral.

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:15.449
Neutral.

01:24:15.517 --> 01:24:17.785
- Generators.
- Four down and guarded.

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:19.653
- Brakes.
- Set.

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:22.156
- Mags.
- Master on.

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:25.125
And I'm firing up number three.

01:24:44.712 --> 01:24:46.747
They were just spotted
at the flight museum.

01:24:50.518 --> 01:24:52.252
Welcome aboard, skipper.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:53.921
Just like old times.

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:02.296
All right, let's find us
a runway.

01:25:10.572 --> 01:25:13.974
Very touching. Where's the money?
Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you.

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:16.076
I just... I just
want my money.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.546
Ok. Ok.

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:23.917
You said you weren't
gonna kill me.

01:25:23.985 --> 01:25:25.219
I lied.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:29.256
Put the gun down now.
Nice and easy.

01:25:29.324 --> 01:25:33.494
- Hanks, what are you doing?
- FBI. You scumbag.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:39.600
- You ok?
- Yeah.

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:41.635
Am I under arrest?

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:46.173
You prepared to testify against Joe
Scanlin, his father and the operations?

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.642
It would give me great pleasure.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:56.917
- Is it all here?
- All 100,000 of it.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.753
Wait a second. She's lying.
There's a lot more...

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.155
Shut up.

01:26:01.222 --> 01:26:03.090
I'll be right back.

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:09.096
Agent blessings, we're inside the hangar.
I got Scanlin and the girl.

01:26:11.599 --> 01:26:13.300
We are entering the building.

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.772
Stay here.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:22.910
Taylor!

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:28.315
Grandpa!

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.218
Taylor!

01:26:33.555 --> 01:26:35.455
Taylor, stop!

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.763
Hey, there's a kid
on the runway.

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.437
That's my grandson!

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:54.341
You boys ready
to pull this cork?

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:55.943
It's about time.

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.715
- To the corps.
- - To the corps.

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:07.221
Let's take this baby up.

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:31.712
- Do you want me to set a course?
- Hell we're setting a course.

01:27:31.714 --> 01:27:33.447
Just head toward the sun.

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:40.254
Get in. There's not much time.

01:27:40.321 --> 01:27:42.322
They're flying that plane
on nothing but fumes.

01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.792
If this is a suicide attempt,
maybe you can talk 'em out of it.

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:51.999
Ok, boys, we're gonna have to turn
it around. We're out of fuel.

01:27:52.066 --> 01:27:54.134
I say we go down with the ship.

01:27:54.202 --> 01:27:57.471
No. No, no, we got
too much to live for now.

01:27:57.538 --> 01:28:03.477
I will not dishonor this ship or our
fallen brothers by crashing this plane.

01:28:03.479 --> 01:28:05.245
Oh, that's just great.

01:28:05.313 --> 01:28:07.614
We might as well
finish the bottle.

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:10.217
I have the pilot's son
and grandson here.

01:28:10.219 --> 01:28:12.419
My dad's up there.
Can I speak to him?

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.221
Hey, dad. Dad, come in.

01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:18.325
- We've lost number three.
- Copy that. Lost number three.

01:28:18.393 --> 01:28:21.061
Please come down.
I'm not ready to say goodbye.

01:28:21.063 --> 01:28:23.597
I'm not either, son.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:30.971
- We've got trouble.
- I see it.

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:35.942
- Airport in sight.
- I'm having another drink.

01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:37.044
Me too.

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.716
It's gonna be ok.

01:28:53.194 --> 01:28:55.095
Lining it up.

01:29:00.868 --> 01:29:02.736
- Yes!
- Whoo! Yes!

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:13.213
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:29:13.681 --> 01:29:15.148
There you go, partner.

01:29:23.257 --> 01:29:25.325
Three, two, one.

01:29:25.393 --> 01:29:27.828
We're here at the Texas flying
legends museum

01:29:27.895 --> 01:29:34.267
where earlier today three world war
ii veterans commandeered this b-17...

01:29:34.335 --> 01:29:38.171
Dad, once we get this straightened
out, you're coming home.

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:41.775
You might need a bigger house. I'm
bringing some friends with me.

01:29:41.777 --> 01:29:44.244
Well, maybe it's time to get
your own place.

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.313
- Yeah.
- I can live there too.

01:29:46.381 --> 01:29:47.914
Oh, my...

01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.552
Wait a second. Where
are they taking her?

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:55.389
We're placing her
in protected custody.

01:29:55.391 --> 01:29:57.491
Can I talk to her?

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:09.736
Thank you.

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.805
Congratulations. You completed
your mission.

01:30:11.873 --> 01:30:14.074
Could not have done it
without you.

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:16.076
It was the best ride of my life.

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:19.279
Well, I'll be waiting for you
once you get rid of these guys.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.881
Hey, you take care of that car.

01:30:20.883 --> 01:30:23.417
Oh, that's your car, remember?

01:30:24.018 --> 01:30:25.986
Maybe we could
take another road trip.

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:29.423
Yeah, I could use a vacation.

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:32.392
Me too.

01:30:42.203 --> 01:30:46.406
It looks like all's well that ends well
here at the Texas flying legends...

01:30:46.408 --> 01:30:50.877
Well, boys, I guess we got
a lot of explaining to do.
