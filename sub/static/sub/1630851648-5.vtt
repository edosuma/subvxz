00:00.560 --> 00:02.320
"Dear Sir, with regard

00:02.320 --> 00:06.040
"to the upcoming gross indecency
court case of Mr Finch.

00:06.040 --> 00:09.080
"What a nonsense to pursue a man
for his private life!

00:09.080 --> 00:12.480
"Not to mention,
a waste of taxpayers' money."

00:12.480 --> 00:15.480
Things I've read in the newspaper,
disgusting.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.560
Morning!

00:17.560 --> 00:22.040
"Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.240
"Isn't that what the Bible says?"

00:24.240 --> 00:25.720
"Shame on the church.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.960
"Shame on our justice system.
Shame on us all.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.840
"Yours in anger,

00:30.840 --> 00:34.600
"Mrs Catherine Keating,
shop steward and housewife."

00:36.600 --> 00:40.040
Do you find this amusing?
Far from it, Bishop.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.480
Discreetly,

00:42.480 --> 00:45.560
was how the Archdeacon
asked for this to be handled.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.960
With delicacy.
And yet here we are, you and I.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.520
And a housewife quoting
scripture at us in the paper.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.960
He's my friend.

00:54.960 --> 00:57.320
This isn't about him any more.
It's about the church.

00:57.320 --> 00:59.720
The church I know doesn't
turn its back on those in need.

00:59.720 --> 01:02.760
You don't go to court today.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.440
You don't speak for Mr Finch.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.680
You don't pull us into the mire
any more than you already have.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.040
I hope that's understood.

01:17.360 --> 01:19.120
DOOR SQUEAKS
Come in.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.000
Might we have a moment?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.880
No.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.320
Anything you have to say,
Will can hear.

01:33.880 --> 01:37.040
We've come to the end of the road,
I'm afraid.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.800
Whatever the outcome
of your court case

01:40.800 --> 01:44.320
we will be terminating
your position with immediate effect.

01:46.280 --> 01:49.160
Will I have the opportunity
to move to another parish?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.160
We're withdrawing your licence.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.400
I can no longer serve as curate?

01:56.400 --> 01:58.440
How is this fair?
Will.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.320
No, how is any of this fair?

02:00.320 --> 02:05.000
Thank you for taking the time
to tell me in person.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.280
I really do appreciate that.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.720
You would've made
a wonderful parish priest.

02:12.720 --> 02:15.160
I have no doubt about that,
Mr Finch.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.920
This is their shame. Not yours.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.120
I've asked Jack
to be my character witness.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.120
You've dragged Jack into this?

02:27.120 --> 02:29.320
No. I want to do it.
I know you do.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.800
I don't give a damn what they think.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.640
I won't have you losing your job,
too. Please.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.560
For once, let me look after you.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.320
I wish we'd never found out.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.320
I wish it'd stayed a bloody secret.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.040
There's not much to be glad of,
but I'm glad you found out.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.240
If you hadn't,
then you wouldn't know me at all.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.960
Saint Anthony.
Patron saint of missing things.

03:13.960 --> 03:18.640
If you're lost, he'll find you,
at least that's what they say.

03:18.640 --> 03:22.080
The rest of it may be tosh, but...
I always rather liked that.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.240
I want it all to be over.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.160
It will be soon.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.880
It's not just his job he's losing.
It's his home. His calling.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.320
You know his life's over,
and the church doesn't give a damn!

03:37.320 --> 03:39.040
Slow down,
my legs are shorter than yours.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.240
Why aren't you angry?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.040
He's got a solid barrister, Will.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.000
And the judge,
he's a bit of a pompous arse,

03:45.000 --> 03:46.280
but he's fair.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.680
Last indecency case, he gave a fine

03:48.680 --> 03:51.720
and a lecture on the moral turpitude
of young men today.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.600
Just let justice take its course.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.480
That's all you can do.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.920
I just... I feel...
Like you wanna punch someone?

04:01.920 --> 04:04.720
Powerless, I was gonna say,
but punching someone would do.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.320
Hurry up!
Ah, the very man.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.120
Bank robbery in progress.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.560
TYRES SCREECH TO HALT

04:14.560 --> 04:17.560
'Help! Get me out of here!

04:17.560 --> 04:21.080
'Someone, help! Help!'

04:21.080 --> 04:23.360
ALARM SOUNDS,
METAL DOORS CLANK

04:23.360 --> 04:26.040
COINS SCATTER
It's all right. It's all right.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.320
CAR TYRES SCREECH

04:27.320 --> 04:28.880
Bloody hell.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.080
CAR DOOR SLAMS
Call an ambulance. Yes, Sir.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.200
Suspect's car's heading west
down Pembroke Street.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.600
It's a grey Standard Eight.
Stay with him.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.480
What are you playing at? Get over!
You coming or not? Let's go!

04:52.560 --> 04:54.760
Right, stop the car! Stop the car!

04:54.760 --> 04:57.120
Suspect has crashed.
I repeat, suspect has crashed.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.680
Right, suspect on foot.
Approach with caution.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.920
He might be armed, Will!

05:04.920 --> 05:07.160
Will! Will!

05:09.880 --> 05:11.840
'Help her, please.'

05:13.320 --> 05:15.040
MAN SOBS

05:20.720 --> 05:22.200
MAN EXCLAIMS,
BIKE CLATTERS

05:23.520 --> 05:25.080
You all right?

05:33.720 --> 05:35.200
Don't let her die.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.080
BOXES CRASH
Oi!

05:59.760 --> 06:02.080
HEFTY THUMPS,
MEN GRUNT

06:02.080 --> 06:04.480
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't do nothing!

06:04.480 --> 06:07.120
PANTING: OK? I didn't do nothing!

06:21.880 --> 06:23.960
GENTLE SOBBING

06:23.960 --> 06:26.920
Never spent a night apart
in 30 years.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.480
Would you like to pray, Mr Connor?

06:31.640 --> 06:33.440
I'm not the praying kind,
I'm afraid.

06:38.400 --> 06:40.680
Might I sit with her for a bit?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.760
Take all the time you need.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.360
Bastard... who did this...

06:56.000 --> 06:59.760
..you make sure
he gets what's coming to him.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.720
DISTRAUGHT GASP,
SOBBING

07:10.640 --> 07:14.360
Came out of nowhere,
hit me, tied me up.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.520
Bank train you for it.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.560
They tell you if anyone
comes for the money

07:18.560 --> 07:19.920
then fight tooth and nail.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.320
Look where that got me.

07:23.320 --> 07:27.680
Three quid a week and no pension.
Nah, ain't worth it.

07:27.680 --> 07:30.160
How much'd he take?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.400
A thousand pounds
in five pound notes.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
GEORDIE WHISTLES,
DOOR OPENS

07:34.160 --> 07:35.720
We're ready, boss.

07:49.040 --> 07:50.440
No.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.240
He's not here. I'm sorry.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.280
WILL: There must be something here
that pins Malcy to the robbery.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.640
Ah! It's certainly bread, all right.

08:15.960 --> 08:17.320
What's that?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.120
"Mr Finch is, to my mind,

08:22.120 --> 08:24.640
"the most decent man

08:24.640 --> 08:31.160
"you're ever likely to encounter.
Hard-working. Honest. Humble..."

08:32.760 --> 08:35.720
Do you think "humble" or "meek"
sounds more like Leonard?

08:36.960 --> 08:39.160
I don't want you to do it, Jack.

08:39.160 --> 08:41.400
I don't want you
to speak for Leonard.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.040
He asked me to.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.560
And I'm asking you not to.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.000
I know these are trying times,
but I really...

08:50.000 --> 08:51.960
Don't get up in front
of all those people.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.200
DOOR OPENS

08:53.200 --> 08:55.320
What will they think of us?

08:55.320 --> 08:58.000
You may have lost
all sense of compassion,

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
but I certainly haven't.

09:05.680 --> 09:08.680
Well, as I see it,
you're clutching at straws here.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.560
That fella,
he didn't recognise me from Adam.

09:13.560 --> 09:15.760
D'you even care
about the woman you killed?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.320
Her name was Mary Connor.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.360
She would have been
70 next month.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.360
It was an accident.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.880
We've already got you
for manslaughter, son.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.200
It was an accident!

09:29.200 --> 09:30.600
You may as well cough to the lot.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.280
Well, I didn't rob no bloody bank.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.240
What's this?

09:39.480 --> 09:42.160
Never seen it before.
Could be phone numbers.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.600
Except no such numbers exist.
So, what is it?

09:45.600 --> 09:48.440
Ooh, you're the detective,
you tell me.

09:48.440 --> 09:50.400
A woman is dead because of you.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.000
MALCY SCOFFS

09:52.000 --> 09:54.600
Oh, he's lairy for a vicar,
isn't he?

09:56.080 --> 09:58.400
Where's the money, Malcy?

09:58.400 --> 09:59.680
Nah...

10:00.720 --> 10:02.640
..I don't think
I'm inclined to speak any more.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.200
Not till I got my lawyer present.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.720
Ah. Fancy.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.240
Philippa? Dot?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.000
Dot Scott.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.400
Never you mind, anyway.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.480
First names
aren't for the workplace.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.080
Perhaps, I'll ask you out, then.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.120
Stop flirting, Larry.
Telephone this lawyer.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.800
Tell him
we've got his client in custody.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.600
I was hoping to get to the court,
Boss. You know, the pansy.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.880
Schadenfreude
isn't attractive, Larry.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.200
It's Marks and Sparks,
as it happens.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.000
Er, Miss Scott,
the call about the robbery.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.440
The switchboard received it
at 10:53am.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.840
Lasted 12 seconds.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.480
The caller didn't leave any details,
but it was a woman.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.440
You don't happen to have
a transcript...

10:52.440 --> 10:54.440
"There's a van, a bank van,
it's being robbed.

10:54.440 --> 10:57.440
"I was just leaving the library..."
The library.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.920
She's a wonder, isn't she?

11:01.920 --> 11:04.840
Underpaid wonder.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.520
When I was growing up,
I had two aunties.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.800
Well, one was my aunty.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.600
The other was her friend.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.800
No-one paid them much mind
cos, well,

11:18.800 --> 11:20.360
what does it matter in the end?

11:22.280 --> 11:24.040
Baby's breath would look nice.

11:28.160 --> 11:31.240
You will come to the court,
won't you?

11:31.240 --> 11:33.000
I'll hold your hand if it helps.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.920
Oh, what is it, Sylvia?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.480
It's so humiliating.

11:40.480 --> 11:43.080
I've spent my whole life,
people looking down on me.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.880
Husband left.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.240
Childless.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.400
I know it's selfish,
but I don't want that again.

11:51.480 --> 11:55.720
The way I see it, people
are gonna judge you no matter what.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.200
SHE SIGHS

11:57.200 --> 11:59.040
What's it say in the Bible?

11:59.040 --> 12:01.240
"Judge not lest", erm...

12:01.240 --> 12:02.720
"Ye be judged."

12:04.040 --> 12:08.680
I'll be right there, Sylvia.
I'll be right by your side.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.480
Jack'll do Leonard proud.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.160
And who knows,
he might do better than you.

12:18.160 --> 12:19.720
Shh!

12:20.920 --> 12:22.200
WHISPERS: Sorry.

12:23.240 --> 12:26.120
We're looking for a woman...
Sorry, may I?

12:27.800 --> 12:30.480
Detective Inspector.
Very impressive.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.720
Thank you.

12:31.720 --> 12:34.800
Er, we're looking for a
female patron who was in the library

12:34.800 --> 12:37.280
between the hours
of ten and 11 this morning.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.040
No, you're not. You're not
looking for a female patron.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.520
You're looking for me.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.280
I was the one who telephoned.

12:45.280 --> 12:48.200
You're here to accompany me
to the police station, I imagine.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.200
If it's not too inconvenient.
I think in this matter,

12:52.200 --> 12:55.640
my inconvenience matters
very little, wouldn't you say?

13:03.920 --> 13:05.840
Second time's a charm, eh?

13:07.200 --> 13:08.800
You know, if you keep doing these,

13:08.800 --> 13:10.520
you might get someone
to pick me out.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.640
Just be quiet. Hm.
Hm.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.800
GENTLE GASP

13:36.080 --> 13:37.640
It was him!

13:40.880 --> 13:42.640
WHIMPERS

13:42.640 --> 13:45.480
Well, well, well.
How about that?

13:45.480 --> 13:48.120
Second time really was the charm.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.800
Yeah, I did it.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.480
You're confessing.
I jumped in the van. I tied him up.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.960
And I beat him.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.560
God help me,
I knocked that poor lady down.

14:04.560 --> 14:06.800
So, where's the money?

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
Chucked it out the car window.

14:10.920 --> 14:13.200
You cooperated in the end, Malcy.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.000
Judge will look fairly
on you for that.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.720
Yeah, you have a lot more faith
in those bastards than I do.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.960
It doesn't add up.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.080
Wilson said he was beaten
and then tied up.

14:29.080 --> 14:31.120
Malcy said the exact opposite.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.520
Yeah, situation like that,
memories get confused.

14:35.520 --> 14:36.960
Happens all the time.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.520
Need to get the postmortem done,
but the old fella won't shift.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.320
Oh, search Malcy Smith's
escape route.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.960
The money's somewhere between
the bank and where he crashed.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.960
Come on.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.600
Mr Connor.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.760
Didn't wanna leave her on her own.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.720
We'll look after her.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.320
I promise you.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.400
Miss Scott will show you out.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.360
That poor bastard.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.320
The robbery was all so fast.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.120
Criminals don't tend to hang about.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.120
Look, her call was 12 seconds.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.480
So, the robbery
can't have been much longer.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.360
But the way Wilson was tied.

15:44.840 --> 15:46.760
Those knots weren't done in a hurry.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.240
Stand up if you would, Mr Black.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.640
Okey-dokey.

15:54.640 --> 15:56.360
Hands out then.
BLACK CHUCKLES

15:56.360 --> 15:58.120
Go.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.640
What? "There's a van,
a bank van, it's being robbed.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.440
"I was just leaving the library,
a man just got in and...

16:04.440 --> 16:08.280
"Oh, my goodness.
He's come out. He has the money!"

16:08.280 --> 16:09.760
And stop.

16:10.880 --> 16:12.640
What does that tell you, then?

16:12.640 --> 16:14.880
That you can't tie a knot
for toffee?

16:14.880 --> 16:17.240
You were trussed up
like a goose at Christmas.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.600
Would've taken minutes to do that.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.720
The robbery was over in seconds.
How'd you explain that?

16:24.200 --> 16:29.040
Haven't the foggiest.
Maybe, you were tied up already.

16:29.040 --> 16:31.840
And maybe,
the whole thing was staged.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.160
I'd like to speak to my lawyer.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.760
Ah, Mr J Richards again.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.800
What are the chances (?)

16:41.920 --> 16:43.360
All right!

16:48.200 --> 16:51.640
They're in on it together.
They're in on it together.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.520
You know how much
London legal fees are?

16:53.520 --> 16:56.760
Way out of range for a guard.
Way out of range for most people.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.640
Someone's behind this.
Someone bigger than them.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.320
Time for court, Inspector.
Thank you.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.840
Come on then.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.880
Boss!
I'm not here.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.520
I tracked down the London lawyer.
I'll speak to him later.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.800
He's already here.
We have to go, Geordie.

17:14.680 --> 17:17.520
The one time
you do your job properly.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.680
Mr Richards.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.520
Geordie?
Johnny?

17:55.240 --> 17:59.840
INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS

18:14.680 --> 18:16.840
Courage in numbers, eh, Leonard?

18:19.080 --> 18:21.560
CATHY: You've got your posies
and everything?

18:21.560 --> 18:23.200
Oh, here he is!

18:23.200 --> 18:24.600
ENTHUSIASTIC APPLAUSE

18:37.560 --> 18:41.440
Ignore that lot out there.
Load of busybodies.

18:41.440 --> 18:46.920
The Echo's been, it's got quotes
from all of us, hasn't it, girls?

18:46.920 --> 18:49.800
Well, you've become
quite the rabble-rouser, Cathy.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.400
They'll have a job editing out
the blue language, mind.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.840
Once I got going,
I couldn't hold back.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.480
Sylvia? Posy for you.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.640
No. No, I don't think so.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.280
Oh, but...

19:08.680 --> 19:12.600
Well, er, I've represented
Malcolm Smith and Wilson Black,

19:12.600 --> 19:14.880
on and off, for years.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.320
A lawyer. Who'd have thought?

19:17.320 --> 19:20.000
CHUCKLES
And you, a copper!

19:20.000 --> 19:22.600
You haven't changed a bit.
Oh, I wish I could say the same.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.880
That's what four kids does to ya'.
Ooh, four?!

19:26.880 --> 19:28.480
Oh! Poor sod.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.200
And still in the same suit
you were de-mobbed in.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.480
Why waste a good suit?

19:34.480 --> 19:37.440
You were, er, in the same regiment?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.040
No, we...

19:44.800 --> 19:46.080
Royal Engineers.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.520
Northumberland Fusiliers.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.240
There's a song goes,
"Wherever you're gan,

19:52.240 --> 19:53.680
"you're sure to find a Geordie".

19:55.400 --> 19:58.240
Is it possible someone else
is paying on their behalf?

20:01.280 --> 20:03.320
I don't normally do this, but...

20:08.560 --> 20:11.440
This is all the correspondence
I have from them.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.440
Invoices, payments.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
Any idea what this is?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.520
Telephone number, perhaps?
We tried that.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.000
Well, I'll ask my client,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
but I don't think
he'll be very forthcoming.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.160
Geordie.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.520
All rise.

21:12.560 --> 21:14.040
Leonard Earnest Finch,

21:14.040 --> 21:17.040
you're charged
that on 29th of August, 1958,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.960
at Merries Holiday Camp,
in the County of Essex,

21:19.960 --> 21:23.360
you did commit an act
of gross indecency with another man.

21:23.360 --> 21:29.080
This is contrary to Section 13
of the Sexual Offences Act, 1956.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.480
How do you wish to plead?

21:32.080 --> 21:34.640
Guilty. I'm guilty.

21:37.600 --> 21:41.440
JUDGE: Let the prosecution present
their arguments for sentencing.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.560
You are a curate, are you not?

21:46.560 --> 21:49.680
I am, yes. At least...

21:49.680 --> 21:51.200
I was.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.760
You love what you do.
Loved, past tense.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.760
It meant everything to me.

21:58.760 --> 22:02.080
Do you approve of homosexuality,
Mr Finch?

22:03.280 --> 22:06.640
I, er...
Your lifestyle would suggest you do.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.920
Approve, is not the word.

22:12.520 --> 22:16.160
If a member of your congregation
came to you and told you that

22:16.160 --> 22:22.320
they'd engaged in obscene acts
with another man, what would you do?

22:22.320 --> 22:23.880
I would listen.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.440
Would you approve?

22:27.640 --> 22:29.000
I would show them compassion.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.440
Would you tell them God approves?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.280
God loves us all.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.840
Does he love you, Mr Finch?

22:42.840 --> 22:45.280
I hope so.
You hope so?

22:45.280 --> 22:46.560
You're an intelligent man.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.920
You must know
he can't possibly love you.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.840
God couldn't love a man
who sought out a stranger

22:54.840 --> 22:58.760
to fulfil his sordid desires!

22:58.760 --> 23:01.680
You must know that, Mr Finch?

23:01.680 --> 23:03.280
Look at me!

23:06.720 --> 23:10.240
How could God ever love you?

23:10.240 --> 23:13.200
A hypocrite! A sodomite!

23:13.200 --> 23:16.000
A sinner!

23:16.000 --> 23:18.440
How could he possibly love you?

23:21.880 --> 23:23.920
BELLOWS: Answer me, Mr Finch!

23:25.280 --> 23:27.200
TREMBLING: I doubt that he could.
Speak up!

23:27.200 --> 23:29.640
I've always doubted
that he could love me.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.160
SOBS SOFTLY

23:45.440 --> 23:48.360
GEORDIE: Will. Will!
What the hell was that?

23:50.880 --> 23:53.360
Inspector.
Hey, Jeremy.

23:53.360 --> 23:54.760
Who is your angry young friend?

23:54.760 --> 23:56.880
That wasn't justice.
That was an ambush. Sorry.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.840
No-no-no. Don't apologise for me.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.560
You've just ruined
a man's life in there.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.520
Do you care at all?
Mr Finch pleaded guilty.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.920
His life was ruined whatever I say.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.560
Prosecution have to put on
a good show.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.480
Most of them don't believe
what they say half the time.

24:13.480 --> 24:16.160
Just calm down
and let this play out.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.880
Where's Jack?
Will.

24:17.880 --> 24:20.080
Where is he?

24:20.080 --> 24:23.000
You do this,
and it's not just Leonard's future

24:23.000 --> 24:24.640
you have to worry about.

24:29.280 --> 24:32.560
If I could ask Mr Finch's
character witness to step forward.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.280
I'm sorry, Your Honour,

24:34.280 --> 24:37.040
but, er, Mr Chapman's
feeling a little under the weather.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.920
Mr Davenport has kindly agreed
to take my place.

24:39.920 --> 24:43.560
Step forward, Mr Davenport,
if you would.

24:56.160 --> 24:59.800
I wasn't always a religious man.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.240
Far from it.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.320
But what drew me to the church
was love.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.560
God's love.

25:06.560 --> 25:08.520
God loves everyone.

25:08.520 --> 25:12.720
And to doubt his love,
is to doubt God.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.520
If you're lucky enough
to know Mr Finch...

25:15.600 --> 25:19.320
..you'll know that he truly,
truly embodies his purpose.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.000
He's sat at the side of the dying.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.920
He's comforted those in despair.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.480
He has never been anything
but good and kind.

25:32.520 --> 25:35.280
You think what he's done is...
immoral.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.080
But I say to punish him
is far worse.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.560
It wouldn't be justice.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.400
And he wouldn't be
the only one who suffers.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.640
His-his friends...

25:49.360 --> 25:50.560
..his family...

25:51.960 --> 25:55.600
..his congregation, we would...
we would all be the less for it.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.280
Today, Leonard wasn't worried
for himself,

26:00.280 --> 26:01.840
he was worried for me.

26:04.240 --> 26:08.840
That's the man he is.
A man I consider my brother.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.760
So, please...

26:14.760 --> 26:16.360
..please, I-I beg you...

26:17.840 --> 26:19.600
..he deserves
so much more than this.

26:22.280 --> 26:24.600
To consider what I've heard
from Mr Davenport,

26:24.600 --> 26:26.880
we'll adjourn till tomorrow morning.

26:26.880 --> 26:29.960
Mr Finch's bail
will be renewed until then.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.280
That was sensational!

26:34.280 --> 26:36.480
That prosecution fella's face!

26:36.480 --> 26:38.560
Like a slapped behind.
MRS CHAPMAN: Jack!

26:38.560 --> 26:42.040
I had to sit on my hands
to stop myself from clapping.

26:42.040 --> 26:44.960
Almost made me wanna
sit through one of your sermons.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.120
I might take you up on that.

26:47.120 --> 26:49.240
I said "almost".

26:52.280 --> 26:55.840
So, I have a brother.
Of course. Always.

26:58.640 --> 26:59.920
Well, that went well.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.840
Are you keeping your head
above water, Leonard?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.960
It's odd but... I feel relieved.

27:05.960 --> 27:08.160
To say the words.
To say I'm guilty.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.880
No more lying.
No more ambiguity. Just...

27:12.280 --> 27:15.120
..the truth. Plain and simple.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.200
This is who I am.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.160
D'you really think it went well?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.400
Why did Malcy change his mind
so quickly?

27:27.400 --> 27:29.680
He went from denying
being involved

27:29.680 --> 27:31.320
to admitting his guilt like that.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.760
Yeah, I did it.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.880
Only time I've seen a man
turn on a sixpence like that...

27:39.640 --> 27:41.400
..was when a woman was involved.

27:44.720 --> 27:47.400
This is all rather thrilling,
isn't it?

27:47.400 --> 27:49.920
KEYS JANGLE
Like the Count Of Monte Cristo.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.520
Visitor for you.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.160
You recognise this man?

27:59.160 --> 28:01.600
Yes, of course.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.280
From the robbery.

28:04.440 --> 28:07.080
But beyond that?
Beyond the robbery?

28:07.080 --> 28:08.800
You don't have to answer that.

28:18.640 --> 28:20.680
I don't know him.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.240
I'm sorry.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.160
If you could escort Miss Bradley
to my office.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.800
While we talk to Mr Black
and his solicitor.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.040
I have to protect my client.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.200
Not at the expense of the truth,
Johnny.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.600
Um, I'd like to talk now.

28:41.600 --> 28:44.120
I'd like to tell you what happened.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.400
CLOCK CHIMES,
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

28:54.000 --> 28:55.240
I'll be off then.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.720
Night.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.280
I used to pray
no-one would find out.

29:04.560 --> 29:09.280
There were moments...
I'd rather die than be discovered.

29:10.480 --> 29:11.800
But then I came here...

29:13.320 --> 29:16.320
..and you were so fearless, so...

29:16.320 --> 29:18.920
unburdened by what anyone thought.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.360
It made me fearless, too.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.080
What nonsense.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.640
I'm always afraid.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.280
Of what people think.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.640
Mostly, I'm afraid for you.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.560
It'll be a hard life.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.680
VOICE BREAKS: I so want you
to be happy.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.160
I am.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.800
I've never been happier
than I have here with you.

29:55.800 --> 29:58.080
Even when I've been dreadful?

29:58.080 --> 30:01.360
Even when you've been
cross and surly

30:01.360 --> 30:04.840
and you shouted at me
for not cleaning up after myself.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.960
"What the Dickens?"

30:10.040 --> 30:11.600
"What the Dickens?"

30:15.360 --> 30:17.760
GENTLE CLINK

30:17.760 --> 30:20.560
Mr Black admits that he conspired
with Malcolm Smith

30:20.560 --> 30:22.080
to steal a thousand pounds.

30:22.080 --> 30:24.360
He asks forgiveness
from Mrs Connor's family,

30:24.360 --> 30:27.240
may she rest in peace,
and from the Lord God Almighty.

30:30.280 --> 30:32.760
You don't know your arse
from your elbow, Wilson.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.240
Who's running the show?

30:34.240 --> 30:36.720
Someone else is in charge,
aren't they?

30:36.720 --> 30:39.000
We know your legal fees
were paid by someone.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.560
We didn't... My client
has nothing further to add.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.360
Lily enters the room

30:55.360 --> 30:58.840
and they confess quicker than
a politician breaks his promise.

30:58.840 --> 31:00.920
How did she get them
to change their mind?

31:02.520 --> 31:04.440
Not one word passed between them.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.880
What if it wasn't words
that changed their mind?

31:06.880 --> 31:08.760
What if it was a signal?

31:10.480 --> 31:13.320
Er, one last thing, Miss Bradley.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
UNDER BREATH: Goodness,
you are persistent.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.600
Was this the van
you saw being robbed?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.280
Yes. That's the one.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.200
Now, if there's nothing else.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.280
Don't you need your spectacles...

31:26.280 --> 31:28.200
to see the photograph?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.880
Or d'you only put them on when
you're signalling to your minions

31:30.880 --> 31:32.320
to fall on their swords?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.880
It's a police station, love.

31:38.040 --> 31:39.320
You're not gonna get far.

32:01.240 --> 32:04.360
Geordie thinks the judge will
give you a fine. I'd like to pay it.

32:04.360 --> 32:06.640
I already owe you £50.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.680
Well, strictly speaking,
you owe my stepfather.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.640
Thank you.

32:11.640 --> 32:12.920
For everything.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.840
Where will you stay?

32:24.840 --> 32:27.520
In Cambridge for a while.

32:27.520 --> 32:30.920
Then Daniel and I
are thinking of moving.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.560
Somewhere no-one knows us.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.840
Is this from the library?
There's a fine on that, too,

32:42.840 --> 32:45.360
if you're looking to annoy
your stepfather any further.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.640
Clear lenses. It's just a prop.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.200
Malcy and Wilson knew the code.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.560
When you put them on...
it's game over.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.680
Time to confess.

33:02.800 --> 33:06.360
Goodness,
what an extraordinary imagination.

33:09.520 --> 33:14.320
This "butter wouldn't melt" thing
it's all an act, isn't it?

33:14.320 --> 33:17.120
Why is it that men
need to put women in a box?

33:18.680 --> 33:22.320
We're either
sweet and innocent, or...

33:24.040 --> 33:25.880
..outright whores.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.760
And which one would you be?

33:28.760 --> 33:31.080
I came here to do my civic duty.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.040
This is how I'm repaid.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.400
You make the call to the police,

33:36.400 --> 33:38.840
drew us to a violent robbery
that never happened.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.200
It happened.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.840
I saw it.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.960
Where's the money, Lily?

33:48.120 --> 33:49.760
You mean to say
you haven't found it?

33:49.760 --> 33:51.720
SHE SCOFFS

33:51.720 --> 33:53.520
What on earth have you been doing?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.120
Did she say where the money was?

34:00.120 --> 34:01.880
Course she didn't.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.760
If it's a woman running the show,
it's bound to be somewhere clever.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.760
D'you still have
that scrap of paper?

34:16.440 --> 34:18.960
Two, two, three.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.320
Two, two, three.
The Dewey Decimal System.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.680
Who would have thought
it had its uses?

34:23.680 --> 34:25.320
Religious section.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.360
Mm, you're right, God really does
have all the answers. Shh!

34:41.760 --> 34:43.000
What?

34:57.560 --> 35:01.120
All of it, minus £50.

35:01.120 --> 35:02.400
Did you spend it?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.600
This has nothing to do with me.

35:05.600 --> 35:07.560
Oh, and out come the waterworks.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.880
I'd like to get home to my mother.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.560
And out comes the sob story.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.720
'Malcy ties up Wilson.

35:17.800 --> 35:22.800
'Then gives you the money.
Notes only, so it's easier to hide.'

35:22.800 --> 35:24.960
Make it look convincing.

35:26.680 --> 35:29.720
HE GROANS
Then you make the call.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.480
Only you didn't bank on
Malcy killing someone.

35:32.480 --> 35:33.960
The library's a public building.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.800
Anyone could've put
the money there.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.960
Seems rather a coincidence
that you work there.

35:37.960 --> 35:41.640
Strikes me that's all you have
against me... coincidences.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.920
Which is why we're having
the book checked for prints.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.800
50 quid says
your mitts are all over it.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.160
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

35:58.560 --> 36:00.800
You're cutting it fine.
Yeah.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.680
Just doing my bit
for law and order.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.160
Will solved it, didn't he?

36:06.160 --> 36:08.080
All rise.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.720
Mr Finch. There's no doubt
in my mind that you are a man

36:19.720 --> 36:21.840
who has done much for your parish.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.560
A man who, before today,
was held in high regard.

36:24.560 --> 36:30.000
Mr Davenport says under the eyes
of God, you have done no wrong.

36:30.000 --> 36:33.880
That may be so,
but here, we do not answer to God.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.400
We answer to the law.

36:37.720 --> 36:40.280
And these laws are not
open to interpretation.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.000
I was mindful to give you
a non-custodial sentence.

36:45.840 --> 36:47.120
However...

36:48.840 --> 36:50.840
..you are a member of the clergy.

36:50.840 --> 36:54.400
Others trust you, they look to you
to set a good example.

36:55.840 --> 36:59.280
So, I am left with no other option

36:59.280 --> 37:02.320
but to impose a custodial sentence.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.480
You will go to prison
for six months.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.600
Take him down.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.160
AUDIO SLOWS,
EXAGGERATES CLINK OF CHAIN

37:34.400 --> 37:36.920
RUMBLE OF THUNDER,
DOOR CREAKS OPEN

37:42.360 --> 37:44.200
PATTER OF RAIN

37:53.560 --> 37:55.160
Chin up, lovely!

37:59.240 --> 38:01.360
You'll be home before you know it.

38:11.760 --> 38:13.800
SOLEMN STRING MUSIC

38:22.720 --> 38:24.200
CRACK OF THUNDER

38:47.680 --> 38:49.680
DOOR OPENS

38:49.680 --> 38:51.120
Have you heard?

38:52.600 --> 38:54.000
You're pleased, I imagine.

38:55.400 --> 38:56.920
Is that really
what you think of me?

38:56.920 --> 38:59.200
Well, this is the best outcome
for the church.

38:59.200 --> 39:01.120
Your shame neatly tucked away.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.480
Just move on. Forget about it.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.600
But we can't forget, can we?

39:05.600 --> 39:07.800
Not when you get up
and speak so brazen.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.360
If I hadn't said anything,

39:09.360 --> 39:11.200
what kind of man
would that have made me?

39:17.080 --> 39:20.640
Did you ever once think
that I was trying to protect you?

39:20.640 --> 39:24.440
Mr Finch's fate was out of my hands.
But yours...

39:24.440 --> 39:26.920
I've defended you. Made excuses.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.080
I won't defend you any more.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.560
Leonard won't survive in that place.

39:34.560 --> 39:36.280
I'll pray for him.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.280
I'll pray for you both.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.920
Evening, boss.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.920
We got the prints
from the library book.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.560
Lily Bradley?
Malcolm Smith.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.480
What, just his?
Only his.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.160
What about the payments
to the lawyer?

40:08.160 --> 40:10.000
Can we link them to Miss Bradley?

40:10.000 --> 40:13.280
All of them were made in cash.
So we can't link 'em to anyone.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.080
And we're sure she's got
no previous convictions?

40:19.120 --> 40:20.920
She's as clean as a whistle.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.360
What do you want me to do, boss?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.480
Let her go.

40:33.800 --> 40:37.680
How much did you pay
Malcy and Wilson, Lily?

40:42.960 --> 40:44.960
Couple of hundred to do the time?
Stay quiet?

40:46.840 --> 40:49.520
You really do have me pegged
as a master criminal.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.320
You took that 50, didn't you?

40:52.720 --> 40:55.360
Everyone else,
they can take the fall, but you...

40:55.360 --> 40:56.960
you still get your cut.

40:56.960 --> 40:59.960
You're exhausting, Inspector.
A woman died!

41:03.480 --> 41:05.040
A woman died.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.480
Do you have no conscience at all?

41:11.640 --> 41:13.400
I don't know what
you're talking about.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.000
I'm just a librarian.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.640
Inspector?

41:37.200 --> 41:38.960
I hear you got the bastards.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.440
Yeah, we got them, Mr Connor.

41:42.440 --> 41:44.400
Thank you.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.000
Thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

42:01.920 --> 42:03.520
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

42:03.520 --> 42:05.760
They said
you'd be drowning your sorrows.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.400
Lily's in on it.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.840
I'm right, aren't I?

42:21.840 --> 42:25.000
Come on.
You know I can't answer that.

42:27.120 --> 42:30.280
D'you know I rarely question
the goodness of what I do.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.320
Lucky you.
Yeah, but there's days like this...

42:34.280 --> 42:36.000
..good man goes to jail...

42:38.000 --> 42:41.680
..while a woman is killed
and a criminal walks.

42:43.320 --> 42:46.480
Law and justice aren't always
the same though, are they?

42:49.640 --> 42:52.400
Wilson Black, Malcy Smith,
they'll get lesser sentences.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.600
Well, I guess
they've got money behind them.

42:54.600 --> 42:57.720
They've got you behind them.
And I'll do my best to defend them.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.920
But they killed a woman, Johnny.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.480
How can you live with that?

43:07.280 --> 43:09.800
Why a copper?

43:11.600 --> 43:14.000
Well, it wasn't for the money
that's for sure.

43:15.880 --> 43:19.080
You align yourself
with Queen and Country

43:19.080 --> 43:21.160
after everything
they put us through.

43:22.640 --> 43:26.200
It's not about Queen and Country.
It's about doing what's right.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.240
You still believe that fairy tale?

43:37.960 --> 43:41.280
Should be getting home.
To the four kids?

43:41.280 --> 43:44.920
To the four kids. Exactly.

43:44.920 --> 43:48.800
Well, if ever you want to catch up,
you know where I am.

43:51.640 --> 43:53.200
Buy yourself a new suit.

43:58.440 --> 44:01.040
The missing 50 quid.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.640
Hm.
