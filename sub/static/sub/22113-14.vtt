00:00.292 --> 00:02.501
Previously on The Last Man on Earth...

00:02.542 --> 00:04.542
- Do you want to have a baby with Todd?
- I'm sorry?

00:04.579 --> 00:06.446
You said no, right?

00:06.481 --> 00:08.114
I want to have a baby with you.

00:08.148 --> 00:09.890
I'm gonna be a dad.

00:20.635 --> 00:22.161
Um...

00:22.197 --> 00:25.164
so how are we... gonna do this?

00:25.200 --> 00:29.344
First of all, the most important
thing here is your comfort.

00:29.463 --> 00:30.662
Okay, so...

00:30.687 --> 00:33.717
Can I get you some water?
Another pillow? Sock slippers?

00:33.751 --> 00:35.460
- I'm fine.
- What about the room temperature?

00:35.476 --> 00:36.275
Is that fine for you?

00:36.311 --> 00:38.377
Because I can make a fire,
get you some sock slippers...

00:38.413 --> 00:40.583
- Guys, I'm fine.
- Back off, Melissa.

00:40.608 --> 00:41.807
She's fine.

00:41.832 --> 00:44.566
Sorry, Todd.

00:45.849 --> 00:47.453
Just so we're clear...

00:47.489 --> 00:50.911
uh, we're not talking
about actually having sex.

00:50.936 --> 00:53.159
No. No, no, no, no.
No, no. Absolutely no.

00:53.194 --> 00:55.228
You know, the... we're
gonna approach this like a...

00:55.263 --> 00:57.058
like a business transaction.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.865
- Sure. Whatever.
- Okay, great.

00:58.935 --> 01:01.200
So-so, my, um...

01:01.810 --> 01:03.269
c-company...

01:03.304 --> 01:09.040
is-is gonna, uh... uh,
manually, uh, produce

01:09.065 --> 01:12.111
as-as much, um...

01:12.146 --> 01:14.213
uh... product

01:14.249 --> 01:17.450
as-as it can possibly generate.

01:17.485 --> 01:19.711
You know, w-without me passing out.

01:19.736 --> 01:22.866
A-And then my company is going to,

01:22.891 --> 01:27.337
mm, deliver, uh, my product

01:27.362 --> 01:32.231
to your company's... loading zone.

01:32.267 --> 01:35.334
And then your company is-is going to

01:35.370 --> 01:37.802
just basically, uh, uh...

01:37.827 --> 01:41.584
baste the whole store
with, uh... product.

01:41.609 --> 01:44.310
Yeah, could you stop
calling it "product"?

01:44.345 --> 01:45.578
Absolutely.

01:45.613 --> 01:48.548
What... what's-what's a better
word for "product," guys?

01:48.583 --> 01:50.416
Uh, "yield."

01:50.451 --> 01:52.151
- "Overhead"?
- "Deliverable."

01:52.186 --> 01:53.286
- "Output."
- "Export"?

01:53.334 --> 01:54.459
- "Download"?
- "Income."

01:54.496 --> 01:55.415
"Splutter"?

01:55.459 --> 01:57.210
- "Confetti"?
- "Bonuses"?

01:57.225 --> 01:59.431
Or "reams," like paper reams.

02:03.209 --> 02:05.209
Top o' the morning to ya, bud!

02:05.251 --> 02:07.166
Nice, uh, leprechaun skirt.

02:07.201 --> 02:10.303
Healthy airflow for the
old, uh, bag and pipe, huh?

02:10.338 --> 02:12.271
It's nothing compared to
what Erica's got to do.

02:12.307 --> 02:15.241
You know, vitamins, diet,
exercise, all that stuff.

02:15.276 --> 02:18.144
So, word on the street is that
you're ovulating right now.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.280
I mean, that's not
really how it works, bud.

02:21.316 --> 02:24.283
But, yeah, um, Erica's ovulating.

02:24.319 --> 02:26.285
- Erica is... Oh, okay, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

02:26.321 --> 02:29.736
Yeah. Okay. I guess I... I'm missing...

02:29.751 --> 02:32.713
- Ovu... ovulating...
- Women ovulate. Men don't.

02:32.751 --> 02:34.793
All right. And, uh...

02:34.808 --> 02:37.330
I'm assuming you've been
refraining from masturbation?

02:37.365 --> 02:39.231
- Yep.
- Good. I mean...

02:39.267 --> 02:42.301
got to hold on to that
self-abuse juice, knowasa?

02:42.610 --> 02:44.610
- Huh?
- Knowasa?

02:44.636 --> 02:47.339
- What?
- Yaknowasaa?

02:47.652 --> 02:50.073
- I'm sorry, I can't...
- Do you know what I'm saying?

02:50.098 --> 02:52.478
- No, I-I don't.
- No. That's what I'm saying.

02:52.503 --> 02:54.113
- Oh!
- "Do you know what I'm saying?"

02:54.148 --> 02:55.114
- Oh.
- Knowasa.

02:55.149 --> 02:56.182
Got it. Got it. No, no.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.249
And I have been holding off.

02:57.285 --> 02:59.185
Oh, good, good. Why
waste it in practice?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.220
You got to save it
for the game, knowasa?

03:01.255 --> 03:03.422
I do now, bud. Well, I better get to it.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.391
Hey, wait, wait, wait, hang on, bud.

03:05.426 --> 03:08.494
'Cause Carol and I have
a little surprise for you.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.264
Ooh, perfect timing.

03:12.300 --> 03:14.100
- I just finished.
- Well, hopefully

03:14.135 --> 03:17.449
that's what Todd will be saying
in a few short minutes from now.

03:17.474 --> 03:18.574
Is that a...

03:18.599 --> 03:21.824
- A masturbatorium? Yes, it is.
- Worked well for us,

03:21.849 --> 03:23.109
so we thought we'd pay it forward.

03:23.144 --> 03:24.510
- Ah.
- Let me take you through it.

03:24.545 --> 03:26.412
It's no secret that we could use

03:26.447 --> 03:29.009
a few more gentlemen in our world,

03:29.034 --> 03:30.955
so I wanted to give you something

03:30.980 --> 03:34.158
to help you visualize a male result:

03:34.183 --> 03:35.886
images of some of the best traits

03:35.911 --> 03:37.323
that mankind has to offer.

03:37.814 --> 03:40.234
Like the genius of Albert Einstein

03:40.259 --> 03:42.128
and Benjamin Franklin,

03:42.163 --> 03:45.264
the panache of Elvis Stojko,

03:45.299 --> 03:47.923
the stature of Robert Wadlow,

03:47.948 --> 03:51.103
and the robust presence
of William Howard Taft,

03:51.139 --> 03:52.505
Grover Cleveland,

03:52.540 --> 03:56.208
and Donald Trump, our
three fattest presidents.

03:56.244 --> 04:00.246
So when you're masturbating,
just picture these men.

04:00.639 --> 04:02.458
Okay. Thanks, Carol.

04:02.483 --> 04:04.481
Now, in terms of lotion,

04:04.506 --> 04:06.185
got a lot of options here for you.

04:06.220 --> 04:08.320
But I've gone ahead and preselected

04:08.356 --> 04:10.356
my personal favorite.

04:10.391 --> 04:13.801
A 2012 bottle of Golsten
Farm's Shea Butter.

04:13.826 --> 04:15.261
Provides fluidity of motion

04:15.296 --> 04:17.329
with just the right amount of purchase.

04:17.365 --> 04:19.690
Goes without saying,
it is paraben-free,

04:19.714 --> 04:21.500
and she's got one hell of a nose on her.

04:21.536 --> 04:24.856
Here. Get in there. Come on.

04:24.881 --> 04:26.667
- Now, get in there.
- Mmm.

04:26.692 --> 04:28.659
- See how she opens up?
- Mm-hmm.

04:28.684 --> 04:30.209
Here, dance with her.

04:38.518 --> 04:40.485
Yeah. That's fine.

04:40.510 --> 04:42.492
Yeah, well, this is my stop.

04:42.517 --> 04:44.366
Oh, sure, sure. Here.

04:46.851 --> 04:49.161
Yeah.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.097
O Captain! My Captain!

04:53.125 --> 04:54.334
Oh.

04:59.609 --> 05:02.308
Okay, Todd, well, I'll leave you to it.

05:02.788 --> 05:04.721
Okay. Thanks, Carol.

05:07.929 --> 05:10.249
Okay, now, the first thing
you're gonna want to do

05:10.284 --> 05:14.112
is to part your pubic thatch
and locate your body's dong.

05:14.137 --> 05:15.480
You got it, bud?

05:15.505 --> 05:17.056
Next, you're gonna want to think

05:17.091 --> 05:19.158
on some kind of alluring scenario.

05:19.209 --> 05:22.127
Bad pitch: You're walking
on a polar ice field,

05:22.163 --> 05:25.297
and you come upon a
stranded dogsled team.

05:25.334 --> 05:27.498
All the dogs are dead...
natural causes... but...

05:27.499 --> 05:29.914
Sorry, bud. C-Could I
get a little privacy?

05:29.939 --> 05:31.337
Oh, yeah. You got it, bud.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.239
Everybody, be quiet!

05:33.274 --> 05:35.141
Todd's about to masturbate!

05:35.176 --> 05:36.740
Right now!

05:36.765 --> 05:38.631
Quiet!

05:42.166 --> 05:43.549
Hey, girl.

05:43.574 --> 05:45.741
Oh. Hey, Melissa. What's up?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.221
I just wanted to thank you.

05:49.257 --> 05:52.053
- Oh.
- Todd's smiling again.

05:52.078 --> 05:55.014
He's laughing. He's just... he's happy.

05:55.039 --> 05:56.498
And it's all 'cause of you.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.867
- Oh.
- You're...

05:57.892 --> 06:00.176
just an angel.

06:00.201 --> 06:02.234
- I'm not an angel.
- You are!

06:03.795 --> 06:05.962
You are.

06:06.031 --> 06:07.383
Okay.

06:07.914 --> 06:09.108
Well, thanks.

06:09.143 --> 06:11.177
God, I just feel so close to you!

06:11.212 --> 06:13.959
Like, we've been
friends for a while now,

06:13.984 --> 06:16.448
but I think now it's
time for us to be...

06:16.484 --> 06:19.251
friends friends, you know?

06:19.287 --> 06:21.420
- Yeah, I-I guess so.
- 'Cause, like,

06:21.455 --> 06:23.255
when's the last time we just dished?

06:23.291 --> 06:26.207
Or-or did, like, really
silly girly stuff,

06:26.209 --> 06:28.376
like lip-synched into a wooden spoon

06:28.419 --> 06:31.371
or just, aah, got tangled up in ribbons?

06:31.403 --> 06:33.589
Oh, I think, I think...

06:33.614 --> 06:34.996
- never?
- What do you say

06:35.021 --> 06:37.003
we boogie down the
street, get some candles,

06:37.028 --> 06:39.171
burn them down, and make new candles.

06:39.207 --> 06:41.173
Am I right, queen?

06:41.477 --> 06:43.071
Yeah.

06:43.096 --> 06:45.144
You know, I think I'm just gonna...

06:45.179 --> 06:48.711
- stay here and fold clothes.
- That is so you!

06:48.751 --> 06:50.960
You're so funny. God, you just...

06:51.001 --> 06:52.451
you just put me in such a silly mood.

06:52.486 --> 06:56.155
Like, I just want to, aah,
like, wear a giant tie.

06:56.190 --> 06:58.557
Oh. Okay.

06:59.562 --> 07:00.820
Well, I'll see you later.

07:00.845 --> 07:02.194
Yeah, you will.

07:02.219 --> 07:03.687
- Okay.
- Big-time.

07:06.775 --> 07:08.434
- Peaches?
- Peaches.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.562
Five.

07:10.587 --> 07:12.009
Green beans?

07:12.034 --> 07:15.107
- Mm, zero.
- Oh, good. Who needs them?

07:15.142 --> 07:17.103
Well, the babies, for one.

07:17.128 --> 07:20.744
And Todd, if he's trying to
produce some quality product.

07:20.769 --> 07:24.024
How about you guys can divvy
up my share, and in return,

07:24.049 --> 07:26.899
I'll just take all
y'all's rest of your chili.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.188
Speaking chili, what we got?

07:30.687 --> 07:33.459
Ooh, bad news on the chili front.

07:33.484 --> 07:34.749
Just this one.

07:34.792 --> 07:37.917
Homestyle beefy with
extra beef? Yes, please.

07:37.918 --> 07:39.293
- Mom.
- Hand it over.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.103
Mom. Look at this gas bulge.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.235
I don't think that's a good idea.

07:43.271 --> 07:46.682
Carol, a big bulge has never
scared off Gail Klosterman.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.832
So, I'm-a take my chances.

07:48.857 --> 07:50.863
Yeah, maybe I'm overreacting.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.252
You know, I'm just
gonna go pick some fruit.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.334
Ooh, how'd it go, bud? Did you produce?

08:23.417 --> 08:26.043
Hot dang, the juice is loose!

08:26.065 --> 08:28.157
Hey, give it to me. I'll
go run it over to Erica.

08:28.209 --> 08:29.876
Okay, but be careful.

08:29.918 --> 08:31.794
Ooh, heavy.

08:31.827 --> 08:33.693
Grizzle jizzy, bud. Great job.

08:33.729 --> 08:36.186
Make way! Spermatozoa coming through!

08:42.375 --> 08:46.293
Special delivery for
one Ms. Erica Dundee!

08:47.433 --> 08:48.885
Oh, uh, sorry, Gail.

08:48.910 --> 08:51.268
Nope. I'm sorry, but
I'm under strict orders

08:51.292 --> 08:52.168
to bring this to Erica.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.847
- Just give me the bag.
- Oh, God.

08:53.883 --> 08:55.883
I hate it, too, Gail. God, I hate it,

08:55.918 --> 08:58.018
but, yeah, I got to
follow "procotol" here.

08:58.054 --> 08:59.687
Do you mean "protocol"?

08:59.709 --> 09:01.627
People pronounce it in many ways, Gail.

09:01.638 --> 09:03.509
Erica, I got your spermatozoa here!

09:03.534 --> 09:04.956
Gail! Gail!

09:05.050 --> 09:08.929
Oh, you're such fake news! Sad!

09:49.876 --> 09:52.668
Oh, my gol.

09:55.878 --> 09:57.044
Oh, hi. I'm so sorry, Erica.

09:57.079 --> 09:58.879
Did you want to sit next to Gail?

09:58.914 --> 10:00.714
Melissa, should we maybe, uh, go?

10:00.750 --> 10:03.050
- I'm fine right here.
- Really? I-I mean, I insist.

10:03.085 --> 10:05.753
- Todd, I'm fine.
- Okay.

10:05.788 --> 10:08.273
Well, just wondering if you wanted to...

10:08.298 --> 10:10.724
Psst. Remember?

10:11.047 --> 10:12.413
Isn't this funny?

10:12.438 --> 10:14.995
- Mm-hmm.
- So, uh...

10:15.423 --> 10:17.673
- How did it go?
- Um, fine.

10:17.698 --> 10:20.801
Yeah? That's great. Do you
feel like it, um... took?

10:20.836 --> 10:22.703
I mean, it's-it's
probably too early to tell.

10:22.738 --> 10:24.705
- Way too early.
- But I feel like you're glowing.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.490
I mean, do you feel like
you're glowing a little bit?

10:26.515 --> 10:28.809
- Todd, please.
- I think she looks like she's glowing.

10:28.844 --> 10:30.878
- I...
- I'm not glowing.

10:31.318 --> 10:32.376
Wine, please.

10:35.751 --> 10:38.819
Hmm. Hmm.

10:40.089 --> 10:43.090
Hmm! Huh.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.925
Is everything okay, Todd?

10:46.539 --> 10:48.836
Just, are you gonna
drink that whole thing?

10:49.180 --> 10:51.075
- Why? Do you want some?
- No.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.140
I'm-I'm doing, uh, water.

10:53.165 --> 10:58.005
You know, because of our
whole, you know, little dealio.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.792
That's great. Good for you.

11:03.217 --> 11:05.045
Oh, my God.

11:05.081 --> 11:07.334
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

11:09.279 --> 11:12.314
I wrote a poem.

11:13.027 --> 11:14.688
"Girlfriends."

11:14.709 --> 11:17.959
There when we laugh, there when we cry.

11:18.209 --> 11:21.292
Hey, Erica, remember this tie?

11:21.918 --> 11:24.517
Nail polish. Boys.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.082
See-through containers.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.917
Putting paper clips in our mouths

11:27.959 --> 11:30.589
- to pretend they're retainers.
- Oh.

11:30.626 --> 11:34.480
You're beautiful and smart,
and you have so much style.

11:34.626 --> 11:38.585
I can't wait for you and
Todd to produce this 'chile.'"

11:38.626 --> 11:40.544
Thank you, Melissa.

11:40.584 --> 11:42.584
No, I'm not done. This
is the sitting portion.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.200
"Seated or standing, we're never apart,

11:45.225 --> 11:48.981
'cause you'll always have
a big piece of my heart."

11:49.006 --> 11:50.792
- The end.
- Cool.

11:50.827 --> 11:53.895
- More wine, hon?
- That'd be a hard yes.

11:54.386 --> 11:56.455
Everyone!

11:56.480 --> 11:57.956
Everyone!

11:58.918 --> 12:00.669
We've got company.

12:02.083 --> 12:03.287
We've got company?

12:03.312 --> 12:04.229
Who?

12:04.292 --> 12:05.209
I don't know?

12:05.257 --> 12:06.566
I didn't see them.

12:06.591 --> 12:09.911
But all the proof I need is in here.

12:15.626 --> 12:17.418
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

12:17.512 --> 12:19.007
Is this...?

12:19.186 --> 12:20.513
A bowel movement.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.873
- Ugh.
- But that's not all.

12:23.038 --> 12:25.040
You want to know the
weirdest thing about it?

12:25.065 --> 12:26.932
That it's sitting on the dinner table?

12:26.957 --> 12:30.770
No. It's fresh.

12:32.683 --> 12:34.816
How do you know it's not Tandy's?

12:34.876 --> 12:37.377
- Did you find this under
the "city dump" sign? - No.

12:37.459 --> 12:39.054
- At the base of the water slide?
- No.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.542
- Next to the toilet at the youth center?
- Gross.

12:41.636 --> 12:43.884
I found it near the orange tree.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.175
Orange tree. Orange tree.

12:51.667 --> 12:54.959
Gang, I cannot, in good conscience,

12:54.985 --> 12:57.019
take credit for this booty cigar.

12:57.046 --> 12:59.974
- See?
- It's probably just Jasper's.

12:59.999 --> 13:02.188
My gut's telling me it isn't.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.721
I mean, the density,
the sheen, the crumb...

13:05.746 --> 13:07.715
This is an adult.

13:07.762 --> 13:11.331
I'm telling you, someone's out there.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.433
Yeah. His name's Jasper.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.100
Jasper, huh?

13:20.342 --> 13:23.543
Well, at least I know he's eating well.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.709
- Todd?
- Huh?

13:35.796 --> 13:38.535
- What are you doing?
- D-Doing inventory.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.293
You know, of-of the entire house.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.462
And I came across this box
of... What-what is this?

13:42.564 --> 13:44.660
Oh, that's right. Tampons.

13:44.685 --> 13:47.185
So, you know, um, my tampon records show

13:47.210 --> 13:49.146
that there were six
in the box last week,

13:49.171 --> 13:51.504
which also jibes with today's
count, you know, also six.

13:51.606 --> 13:55.169
So, um... I hate to ask
this, but I got to do it.

13:55.231 --> 13:56.753
Is that because none were used or...?

13:56.778 --> 13:59.412
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, what's going on in here?

13:59.514 --> 14:01.281
Todd is snooping around,

14:01.383 --> 14:03.383
trying to figure out
if I'm pregnant yet.

14:03.485 --> 14:06.185
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It's
just, it's been two weeks,

14:06.288 --> 14:07.977
and I am champing, guys.

14:08.002 --> 14:10.865
Maybe I can help. Uh,
Erica, when pregnant,

14:10.890 --> 14:13.459
the female breasts often
get tender to the touch.

14:13.542 --> 14:15.460
- Ah.
- So, using the palm of your hand,

14:15.584 --> 14:17.667
- make a cupping motion and just...
- Oh, God!

14:17.766 --> 14:20.633
Look, I am taking a
pregnancy test today.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.402
- Oh, great.
- I will let you know the results

14:22.504 --> 14:23.703
as soon as I get them.

14:23.805 --> 14:26.436
Until then, could you please
stay out of my tampon drawer?

14:26.461 --> 14:28.131
- Sorry.
- And don't ask me any questions

14:28.167 --> 14:30.043
about the sensitivity
level of my breasts.

14:30.044 --> 14:32.459
- I would never.
- And generally just avoid me, okay?

14:32.581 --> 14:34.581
Todd, I think this might
not be your month, bud.

14:34.683 --> 14:36.416
Sounds like someone's
getting their period.

14:36.518 --> 14:37.780
Okay, that's it. Get out.

14:37.805 --> 14:40.453
- Yeah, okay. Sorry.
- Thanks for coming.

14:48.622 --> 14:50.263
What you doing, hon?

14:50.365 --> 14:53.399
Well, I'm still not
convinced that it was Jasper

14:53.501 --> 14:55.401
who left his leavings
by the orange tree,

14:55.503 --> 14:58.171
so just setting up a
makeshift alarm system,

14:58.273 --> 14:59.539
you know, just in case.

14:59.641 --> 15:01.541
- Whatever floats your boat.
- Well, you know,

15:01.643 --> 15:04.577
at the very least, it'll
be a calming presence.

15:11.159 --> 15:12.285
Yeah.

15:12.387 --> 15:14.487
It's like friggin' Rainforest Cafe.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.753
Mmm.

15:22.497 --> 15:24.430
Hey. So?

15:25.508 --> 15:26.975
Sorry, Todd.

15:30.417 --> 15:33.293
Guess you're gonna go hit the sauce.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.773
Sorry, did you say something?

15:35.828 --> 15:37.343
I-I'm just gonna come out and say it.

15:37.445 --> 15:39.039
You know, if I were
trying to get pregnant,

15:39.064 --> 15:40.446
I wouldn't be guzzling
wine at every turn

15:40.548 --> 15:41.614
like a teen at a hootenanny.

15:41.716 --> 15:44.450
I've been having one
glass at dinner, tops.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.878
I saw you having coffee
the other day, too.

15:46.903 --> 15:48.488
You know, and you still haven't used

15:48.590 --> 15:50.356
that meditation stone I got you, so...

15:50.458 --> 15:53.526
Look, could you please stop
acting like a crazy person?!

15:53.628 --> 15:55.595
Yeah, and could you please
stop acting like you want this?!

15:55.709 --> 15:57.724
Because it's pretty clear you don't.

15:57.751 --> 15:59.252
Look, if this is a preview

15:59.283 --> 16:00.533
of how you're gonna be as a father,

16:00.635 --> 16:03.302
we might need to change this
from a co-parenting situation

16:03.405 --> 16:05.438
to more of a sperm donor situation.

16:05.540 --> 16:08.650
Y-You can't do that. Look,
if I put a baby in you,

16:08.690 --> 16:11.060
you better believe I'm
gonna be a part of its life.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.584
Then maybe you shouldn't
put a baby in me.

16:21.709 --> 16:23.335
Are you here to get me to have

16:23.417 --> 16:25.584
a pillow fight or something?

16:25.601 --> 16:30.350
Todd told me the news, so...
I just came to see how you were.

16:30.429 --> 16:31.607
Well, to be honest,

16:31.632 --> 16:34.441
I think I need a little
space from Todd and...

16:34.626 --> 16:37.544
other people.

16:37.702 --> 16:40.836
Look, I'm sorry for being weird.

16:41.586 --> 16:45.419
I-I just haven't had many
girlfriends in my life.

16:46.751 --> 16:48.085
It's okay.

16:48.125 --> 16:51.492
But just know that whatever happens,

16:52.305 --> 16:54.702
it won't change how thankful I am

16:54.727 --> 16:56.630
for you even giving this a shot.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.085
Thanks, Melissa.

17:00.447 --> 17:02.729
I wrote you another poem.

17:03.406 --> 17:05.548
- I'm kidding.
- Oh.

17:05.646 --> 17:07.173
Phew.

17:08.917 --> 17:10.710
Okay, Clancy, come to Daddy.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.021
Come to Daddy.

17:12.047 --> 17:14.851
Oh, good boy. Good boy.

17:14.876 --> 17:16.742
Now sit up. Sit up for me.

17:16.778 --> 17:19.545
Oh, good boy.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.530
Good boy.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.615
Oh, hey, bud.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.950
I got us a dog. Well, it's a robot dog.

17:24.986 --> 17:27.425
Well, the body's a robot,
and the head's a dog.

17:27.451 --> 17:28.888
It's a taxidermy head. Yeah.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.723
Hey, play dead, Clancy.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.653
Ooh.

17:34.239 --> 17:35.594
There we go. Good boy.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.730
- Isn't that something?
- Hmm.

17:38.095 --> 17:40.866
- So, how's it going, bud?
- Test was negative, bud.

17:40.902 --> 17:43.072
Oh, I'm so sorry, bud.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.200
Here. Clancy, comfort Todd.

17:52.968 --> 17:54.436
Hey. Pat his head.

17:54.584 --> 17:56.418
- Get in there.
- Hey.

17:56.452 --> 17:58.114
Look, you'll get 'em next time.

17:58.125 --> 18:00.876
- If there is a next time.
- Wait, what do you mean?

18:00.909 --> 18:03.314
Well, we got in a fight,
and I went a little nuts,

18:03.339 --> 18:05.659
and now she might want to pull
the plug on the whole thing.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.959
- Well, I thought she wanted another kid.
- She does.

18:08.009 --> 18:10.148
I'm just not sure she
wants to have one with me.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.170
I see where you're
going with this, okay?

18:12.195 --> 18:14.834
But, Todd, rest assured I will never...

18:14.876 --> 18:18.168
barring your early death...
have a baby with Erica.

18:18.179 --> 18:20.195
Uh, okay. Thanks.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.195
I mean that, bud. Firmly.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.117
- Here, bring it in.
- Yeah.

18:24.179 --> 18:26.546
Now, look, she's not gonna call it off.

18:26.582 --> 18:30.550
Bottom line, she wants a
baby, and you're her only shot.

18:31.707 --> 18:34.072
Yeah. I guess I am.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.203
Thanks, bud.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.764
Hey. Clancy, got a stick!

18:42.809 --> 18:44.986
Go, fetch! Fetch!

18:48.876 --> 18:50.168
Clamp onto it.

18:50.181 --> 18:51.981
Come on.

19:24.325 --> 19:26.017
Who are you?

19:33.088 --> 19:36.204
Tandy. Tandy, did you hear that?

19:36.229 --> 19:37.551
I think someone's in the house.

19:37.586 --> 19:38.785
Look, it's probably just the wind,

19:38.821 --> 19:41.488
but I'll go check it out, okay?

19:48.947 --> 19:50.239
Hello?

19:50.867 --> 19:52.599
Anybody there?

19:59.242 --> 20:01.099
Hello?

20:10.751 --> 20:12.418
Huh.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.234
Mike.
