WEBVTT

01:18.070 --> 01:19.060
Get in.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.746
Leave the bread.

02:21.300 --> 02:23.257
So, Gary is Captain?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.768
The guy who works on
the Orbis project

02:25.890 --> 02:28.131
and works for the guys
who gave you the gift basket

02:28.270 --> 02:30.056
and the orangey chocolate thing?

02:30.190 --> 02:33.228
That dude runs more game
than anyone in SoCal.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.810
He's a legend.

02:35.730 --> 02:36.731
Gary?

02:37.650 --> 02:38.640
Really?

02:39.110 --> 02:40.566
What do you know about him?

02:40.990 --> 02:42.446
I think he's a super-nice guy.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.901
He sent me out for burritos
this morning. His treat.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.533
Is he taking meetings out here,
or...? Who's he talking to?

02:48.660 --> 02:51.163
I don't know. Lawyers keep calling.
He won't call back.

02:53.130 --> 02:55.246
No one gets to Captain,

02:55.380 --> 02:58.589
and here I am
at the center of the maze.

02:59.090 --> 03:02.219
Well, I'm here, too.
Told you, our fates are intertwined.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.752
This has nothing to do with you.

03:04.890 --> 03:08.099
Your temp agency sent you out here.
It's a coincidence.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.130
You keep telling yourself that.

03:10.270 --> 03:11.760
Oh, Jesus.

03:12.350 --> 03:13.761
If I hook Captain...

03:14.690 --> 03:16.601
the commission on that...

03:18.360 --> 03:19.486
Please!

03:19.610 --> 03:22.068
Just give me this one goddamn thing!

03:22.200 --> 03:24.191
Please, God Almighty, please!

03:26.160 --> 03:26.979
Hey.

03:27.950 --> 03:29.998
OK, I think you're hyperventilating.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.861
-Yeah.
-Hey, you know what?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.627
Here. Breathe into my burrito bag.

03:33.750 --> 03:34.956
There you go. Breathe in.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.206
Deep breath. Good.
Deep breaths. Yeah.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.338
Oh, sorry. I scraped off all
the onions and the cilantro.

03:41.470 --> 03:43.086
Sit down. Take a seat. OK.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.251
In the nose... out the mouth.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.098
You can do this, OK? You know why?

03:50.230 --> 03:52.801
Because we're gonna go out there
and talk to him.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.260
OK? You and me.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.186
-OK? OK.
-Yeah, yeah.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.139
OK.

04:32.850 --> 04:33.885
Hey, Gary,

04:34.020 --> 04:36.057
you didn't tell me
that you were Captain.

04:36.480 --> 04:37.720
I go by many names.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.470
Gary.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.020
Captain.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.656
That's it, I guess.

04:48.780 --> 04:50.077
Who's this?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.111
This is my friend, Ernie Fontaine.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.070
Ernie sells toilets.

04:54.670 --> 04:55.660
A sales call.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.120
Fantastic.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.297
OK, toilet man.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.122
Let's go. Let's get this over with.
What do you want from me?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.250
Hey, I get it.

05:05.380 --> 05:07.041
Salesmen are the scum of the earth.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.796
Oh, no, no. I love salesmen.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.012
You know who the best salesman
of all time was?

05:11.810 --> 05:14.017
Jesus of Nazareth. Yeah.

05:14.140 --> 05:16.552
The Seminar on the Mount - masterful.

05:16.690 --> 05:19.432
So, my question to you is,
are you better than Jesus?

05:19.570 --> 05:21.277
Well, I don't know about that.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.811
Oh, no, no, no.

05:22.940 --> 05:25.398
Ernie can make Jesus look like
a pile of shit.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.231
Hey, this kid can sell.

05:27.950 --> 05:29.406
I'm with West Coast Super Sales

05:29.530 --> 05:31.532
and I want to talk to you
about Orbis.

05:31.660 --> 05:32.650
OK, wait a second.

05:33.620 --> 05:36.954
Are you the nut job that crashed our
little meeting at Kaplan Architects?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.325
That took balls, man.

05:39.460 --> 05:43.124
And then you sent some other guy
a couple of days later. Jeff.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.046
You did a real number on him.

05:45.550 --> 05:46.756
That was not my fault.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.632
He caught me
on my way to a happening.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.803
There's an art collective
on the other side of the hill.

05:51.930 --> 05:53.671
Trust-fund kids living in yurts.

05:53.810 --> 05:56.268
They raise goats
and write manifestos about decay.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.846
Anyway, Jeff was with me,

05:57.980 --> 05:59.516
and he ingested some...

06:00.270 --> 06:01.476
exotic flora

06:01.610 --> 06:04.022
and started speaking in tongues.

06:05.690 --> 06:08.193
Feels weird talking to you
while I'm sitting in a pool.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.118
So... why don't you take
your clothes off and get in?

06:29.130 --> 06:31.599
Did everyone enjoy the icebreaker?

06:32.970 --> 06:34.677
I hope it was like an axe

06:34.810 --> 06:37.552
breaking the frozen sea inside you.

06:38.890 --> 06:41.609
My name is Tarquin.
You read about me in the binder.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.892
Everything is in the binder,

06:44.020 --> 06:46.318
so don't slow me down with questions.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.698
The next two days will be fun

06:49.820 --> 06:51.697
and... challenging.

06:52.570 --> 06:55.119
The key thing is to just relax.

06:57.290 --> 06:59.156
This is not a competition,

06:59.290 --> 07:01.622
though we will ask most of you
to leave at some point.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.707
Distillation 1, Distillation 2.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.740
Again, it's all in the binder.

07:07.090 --> 07:08.467
Now, some of you...

07:09.970 --> 07:11.460
the Essence...

07:12.550 --> 07:14.712
will come out the other side

07:14.850 --> 07:17.922
and be invited to The Mingle...

07:19.430 --> 07:21.842
with... Janet.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.156
Well?

07:34.280 --> 07:36.282
It's exactly like you described it.

07:36.620 --> 07:37.826
Even the egg rolls.

07:38.540 --> 07:41.202
Take one from my hoard, if you wish.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.491
Thank you.

07:42.620 --> 07:43.917
Where are you going?

07:44.040 --> 07:45.951
Tarquin asked me to be on a panel.

07:46.710 --> 07:47.791
Cloud of Unknowing?

07:47.920 --> 07:49.627
No, Iron Cage.

07:52.510 --> 07:55.389
So... how's your room?

07:55.930 --> 07:57.136
They put me in a suite.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.130
-It's kind of ridiculous
-Yeah.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.137
Well, maybe later tonight
I can come by your suite,

08:02.270 --> 08:03.977
and we can, you know...

08:05.190 --> 08:06.851
have sexual intercourse?

08:06.980 --> 08:09.938
OK. I think I get what you're saying.

08:11.070 --> 08:12.196
Great.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.401
I don't know.

08:14.110 --> 08:16.021
One thing kind of led to another.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.982
You know, a few guys
found a way in, word spread.

08:19.830 --> 08:23.164
One night,
we started... breaking stuff.

08:25.460 --> 08:26.666
When that got old,

08:26.790 --> 08:30.294
we tried more sophisticated ways
of breaking things.

08:30.420 --> 08:32.501
We started with this giant slingshot.

08:33.590 --> 08:35.797
That led to the catapults, and...

08:39.220 --> 08:41.302
It was just fun building things.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.762
Yeah,
if you're not working on a project,

08:45.900 --> 08:47.857
your thoughts will eat you up.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.988
Is the... Is the trebuchet finished?

08:55.570 --> 08:57.527
Yeah,
ready to launch in a few nights.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.656
And then we're closing up shop.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.241
-How does that make you feel?
-I can't complain.

09:04.710 --> 09:08.374
I mean, I got 20 years out of Orbis.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.163
I look at my nephews.
They will never have that anywhere.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.621
They will always be hustling
two, three jobs.

09:18.550 --> 09:19.756
Can I ask you something?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.267
Why the hell do you care
about this stuff?

09:24.850 --> 09:26.306
I guess I need a project, too.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.853
Something to keep my thoughts
from eating me up.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.693
I spent my whole career
thinking I'd write a book someday.

09:36.110 --> 09:38.317
_ Turn a feature
into something bigger, but...

09:39.740 --> 09:40.866
never happened.

09:43.540 --> 09:45.076
I could never commit.

09:47.210 --> 09:49.167
There was always something
to distract me.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.160
A new job.

09:52.460 --> 09:53.666
A new guy.

09:55.800 --> 09:59.464
I always thought if I could just
go some place alone for a while...

10:00.470 --> 10:01.756
I'd get it done.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.590
But I never did.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.221
Because I'm a hack.

10:13.440 --> 10:14.851
You're not a hack, Connie.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.156
Lodge 49.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.691
There you are.

10:23.410 --> 10:24.480
Did you forget?

10:24.910 --> 10:26.867
-What?
-Your MRI!

10:27.620 --> 10:30.032
I'm here now. I took off work.

10:31.790 --> 10:34.293
I'm... I'm leaving now.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.312
What are you doing?

10:54.270 --> 10:57.774
I'm just looking for anything
in the Lodge that might be an asset.

10:58.650 --> 11:01.699
Bankruptcy looms. London will want
to recoup whatever they can.

11:01.820 --> 11:04.573
I'm not an expert, but some of
these books might be valuable.

11:04.700 --> 11:07.863
This library is not an asset.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.993
It is... a citadel

11:11.120 --> 11:13.168
to truth and beauty.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.003
The Lodge was waking up until
you walked in with your calculator.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.336
Just doing my job.

11:18.470 --> 11:21.007
Being a Lynx is not a job.

11:21.130 --> 11:23.132
Well, I'm sorry, but for me it is.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.928
Do you know how many lodges
we administer worldwide?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.097
The amount of paperwork
is extraordinary.

11:28.230 --> 11:30.551
Especially with so many lodges
closing down.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.431
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

11:32.560 --> 11:33.550
Alchemy?

11:34.440 --> 11:37.523
The... The Magnum Opus
of Harwood Fritz Merrill?

11:37.650 --> 11:40.142
I thought London
was the heart of everything.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.193
Well, administratively speaking,
it certainly is.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.948
How did you even become a Lynx?

11:48.080 --> 11:50.458
Well, my Great-Aunt Dahlia
was a member,

11:50.580 --> 11:54.323
and I went to a few dinners with her
at the Lodge, and that was OK.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.703
And then, before she died,
she encouraged me to become a member,

11:57.840 --> 11:58.830
and I did.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.837
When I got my certificate
in accounting,

12:00.970 --> 12:04.258
they offered me a position
on the staff, and I worked my way up.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.347
It's not the most exciting story,

12:08.470 --> 12:10.427
but I'm not the most exciting man.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.228
Yeah, there's some unusual things
about working at Lodge 1.

12:15.810 --> 12:17.517
Traditions of the Order and so on.

12:17.650 --> 12:20.108
But mostly it's just work.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.776
Meetings and spreadsheets.

12:21.900 --> 12:22.890
Get out.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.619
You are banned from the library.

12:26.740 --> 12:29.198
-Blaise, there's really no reason--
-Get out!

12:41.340 --> 12:42.717
So, you live out here?

12:42.840 --> 12:43.671
No.

12:43.800 --> 12:44.790
No.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.592
This is just one of my
pieds--terre.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.097
Sometimes I've got to lay low.

12:49.930 --> 12:52.763
I live in Palos Verdes
in a giant house,

12:52.890 --> 12:54.517
with my wife.

12:55.190 --> 12:57.978
Well, you're a hard man to find.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.817
Most of the time,
I can't find myself.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.732
I'm trapped in a tower, Ernie.

13:03.860 --> 13:06.101
A tower
made out of endless litigations

13:06.240 --> 13:10.359
surrounding any number of commercial
or residential properties

13:10.490 --> 13:12.902
in Southern California
and certain parts of Baja.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.071
The system, man.
It's not fair. It's not fair.

13:16.210 --> 13:18.167
Everything I do is 100% legal.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.667
One hundred percent.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.253
Not always according to the letter
or spirit of the law,

13:23.380 --> 13:24.586
but, these days,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.178
you've got to be willing to live
in @ moral gray area.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.882
That's where fortunes are made.

13:29.010 --> 13:31.001
I'm the gray man in the gray area.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.802
So, what wholesalers
will you be pulling from?

13:34.940 --> 13:36.647
I have great relationships with--

13:36.770 --> 13:38.397
How do you guys know each other?

13:38.520 --> 13:41.683
We belong to the Ancient
and Benevolent Order of the Lynx.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.527
Ernie's a Luminous Knight.
I'm his squire.

13:43.650 --> 13:46.950
It's just a social club.
You know, beer and softball.

13:47.070 --> 13:49.368
No, it's not.
It's way more than that.

13:49.490 --> 13:52.869
-We possess secret knowledge.
-Secret knowledge of what?

13:53.950 --> 13:55.452
Yeah, I can't tell you.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.242
But... basically,
the secrets of alchemy.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.417
OK, so, do you guys do weird shit?

14:00.540 --> 14:02.542
Like robes and candles and Latin?

14:02.670 --> 14:04.160
No, no, no. It's not like that.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.416
What are you talking about?
It is like that.

14:06.550 --> 14:07.927
OK, this is awesome,

14:08.050 --> 14:10.678
but I'm gonna need
a little more context.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.598
-How about we do it over dinner?
-Sure.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.519
But maybe first I can take you
for a spin through our catalogs?

14:15.640 --> 14:17.722
You want my business,
wine and dine me.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.727
I'm Captain, for Christ sakes!

14:20.900 --> 14:22.186
Now, I know a special place.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.106
Best Shrimp Louie
in Riverside County,

14:24.230 --> 14:26.232
and they have live flamenco.

14:26.950 --> 14:27.940
Sound good?

14:29.110 --> 14:30.737
-Yeah! Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.191
So, I looked him in the eye.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.789
Always look your adversary
in the eye.

14:37.910 --> 14:39.036
And I said,

14:39.170 --> 14:40.956
"The nights are cold in Zurich...

14:42.460 --> 14:45.794
but nothing can extinguish
the flamings of my heart."

14:47.590 --> 14:49.046
Was there laughter?

14:50.260 --> 14:51.250
Yes.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.886
Was there understanding?

14:54.640 --> 14:57.678
Yes, again, because an hour later,
flying over the Alps,

14:57.810 --> 15:00.973
we signed a mutually beneficial
vendor agreement.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.643
So, anyway, the point is,
if you really want this,

15:04.770 --> 15:07.740
you need to love it,

15:07.860 --> 15:11.444
eat it, drink it, smoke it,
snort it, shoot it.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.949
It doesn't matter how you get it.
Just make sure that you do.

15:15.370 --> 15:17.156
And if you're wondering
how I got it...

15:21.790 --> 15:22.916
I listened.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.831
I listened.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.463
OK, my time is up.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.382
I wish you all the best of luck,

15:32.510 --> 15:35.753
and I hope to see some of you
at The Mingle.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.149
A bull whip, a chalice, a snow globe.

15:44.940 --> 15:48.149
Out of these objects,
you will dream storm a marketing plan

15:48.280 --> 15:49.679
for your shadow chain.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.236
You have 20 minutes.

15:55.370 --> 15:56.360
Commence.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.281
Well, who wants to scribe?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.115
Give me the quill.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.493
Hey, Liz, is it true that you
actually spent time at Shamroxx?

16:09.590 --> 16:10.580
Yeah.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.370
Field research, that's smart.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.593
Exactly. Some things
you can only learn at street level.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.178
Field research? No.

16:20.770 --> 16:22.056
I mean, yeah.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.761
It was... It was a good strategy,
you know.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.766
I mean, I learned a lot.

16:29.980 --> 16:32.062
OK, let's start.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.271
Hit me with your dream storms.

16:38.990 --> 16:41.448
I am not gonna sad-sack
my way to the end.

16:41.580 --> 16:42.900
We should stay on schedule.

16:43.330 --> 16:44.786
Now, Band Night's next week.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.163
It might be everyone's last chance
to see Don Fab do his thing.

16:48.290 --> 16:49.746
-Let's get the word out.
-Yeah.

16:49.880 --> 16:52.872
Do a phone tree, a fax blast.
I mean, whatever it takes.

16:53.510 --> 16:55.171
I'll bring the guys from Orbis.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.752
Squire Dud thinks
that they should join the Lodge.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.676
God, that kid cares.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.051
-It's kind of scary.
-Connie!

17:03.600 --> 17:05.728
Tell Scott Band Night's on next week.

17:27.329 --> 17:28.319
Oh, jeez.

17:28.710 --> 17:31.042
-Buddy, you got a little sun.
-I went to the beach.

17:31.170 --> 17:33.377
I spent an hour in the waves.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.177
When I got out, I felt something...

17:37.180 --> 17:38.170
I don't know...

17:38.890 --> 17:40.460
humming inside of me.

17:41.430 --> 17:46.220
I have never felt so relaxed.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.470
Blaise...

17:49.150 --> 17:51.141
our emissary needs a drink.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.772
He's not an emissary.

17:53.150 --> 17:54.777
He's an executioner.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.350
Blaise,

17:56.490 --> 17:59.118
honey... don't be a dick.

18:00.740 --> 18:02.651
Well, T'll get you a drink.
Want a drink?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.690
I'll get you a drink. You want a...

18:08.420 --> 18:11.333
So, the Lynx can see through walls?

18:11.960 --> 18:12.950
No, it's a metaphor.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.541
Philosophy with a full bar.

18:16.010 --> 18:17.876
-You guys accepting new members?
-Yeah!

18:18.010 --> 18:20.081
We'll accept anybody.
Just come by the Lodge.

18:20.220 --> 18:22.257
Actually, the Lodge might be closing.

18:22.390 --> 18:23.425
It's a long story.

18:23.560 --> 18:24.595
What?

18:24.720 --> 18:26.427
No! That's awful.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.227
I hate it when
the old beautiful stuff disappears.

18:29.350 --> 18:32.069
Obviously, I do a lot of teardowns
and redevelopment,

18:32.190 --> 18:34.101
but, you know, even still.

18:35.030 --> 18:38.989
So, Gary, if we can hop back in...

18:39.110 --> 18:41.659
We do clean-out and backwater valves,

18:41.780 --> 18:43.782
plus stainless-steel P-traps
and plugs--

18:43.910 --> 18:45.366
Ernie, let me ask you a question.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.209
When you were a kid, did you dream
about selling plumbing supplies?

18:49.330 --> 18:52.209
No, no, no. I wanted to be a pitcher
for the Dodgers.

18:52.340 --> 18:55.298
-Did you play ball?
-Sure. I was All-CIF at Poly.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.252
Well, you know, honorable mention.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.008
But then reality, you know...

19:00.130 --> 19:01.336
Reality, indeed.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.809
I wanted to be an astronaut.
Go to the moon.

19:05.350 --> 19:06.715
But then I got a summer job

19:06.850 --> 19:09.228
with a mechanical contractor
in Whittier, and...

19:10.480 --> 19:11.550
here I am.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.600
What about you, Squire?

19:14.020 --> 19:15.852
What did you dream about doing
as a kid?

19:19.650 --> 19:23.735
When I was a kid, I just wanted
to work at my dad's pool shop.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.190
You know, and do what he did.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.537
Surf in the morning, work all day...

19:29.370 --> 19:31.361
and then drink beer
by the pool at night.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.246
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.468
Do you guys know what "duende" means?

19:40.050 --> 19:42.462
It's what the flamenco call soul.

19:43.180 --> 19:46.468
It's that real thing inside us
that can't be faked.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.514
Now, this cat has duende out his ass.
I'm gonna put in my requests.

19:50.980 --> 19:51.970
Yeah.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.478
-Hey, buddy. Excuse me.
-Hey, you got to ease up on Captain.

19:55.610 --> 19:57.851
-You're driving him away.
-I'm driving him away?

19:57.980 --> 20:00.108
You're the one who won't shut up
about the Lodge.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.605
Just be cool, OK?

20:01.740 --> 20:03.230
He lives in a tower, man.

20:04.370 --> 20:07.283
He just wants to hang out with you,
Ernie, the man.

20:07.410 --> 20:08.992
So just be...

20:09.120 --> 20:12.169
you know, Ernie... Ernie.

20:12.290 --> 20:14.497
This is a new low -
taking professional advice

20:14.630 --> 20:16.701
from a homeless temp.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.056
My wife and I went to Spain once.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.511
Two weeks in Andalusia.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.470
Something about the light there.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.102
Brenda's a marine biologist.
She loves the sea.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.642
So we'd be in the water all day,
and at night,

20:41.780 --> 20:44.693
- we'd sit in a small caf
and listen to the flamenco players.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.446
We had everything.

20:51.580 --> 20:52.900
-Married, Ernie?
-No.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.049
But I had that once -
the everything you're talking about.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.833
I had it twice, actually.
My high-school sweetheart.

21:05.010 --> 21:07.092
It went away, like it always does.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.136
-Young love.
-Exactly.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.217
I went off, did my thing,
and then she...

21:11.980 --> 21:14.301
a year ago, walked back into my life.

21:15.230 --> 21:17.016
Yeah, she showed up at the Lodge, OK?

21:17.310 --> 21:18.436
But get this...

21:19.770 --> 21:21.602
-She's married.
-What?

21:21.730 --> 21:23.607
-No! Jeez!
-Yeah.

21:23.740 --> 21:24.775
What happened?

21:24.900 --> 21:28.313
I sort of became... her mistress.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.866
We lived in a bubble for a year.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.039
It seemed like
we had everything again.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.571
But then reality caught up to us.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.081
So it's over.

21:39.790 --> 21:40.621
Again.

21:43.090 --> 21:45.297
Man, I love talking.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.850
We can't let this night end.
You guys got some cash on you?

21:50.350 --> 21:51.169
Good.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.551
Because I got a hot tip
on a big cock.

22:12.490 --> 22:14.618
Here's your ducats - $3,500 each!

22:14.750 --> 22:17.117
Oh, my God! Are we in heaven or what?

22:17.250 --> 22:20.072
-What next, gentlemen?
-Hell, we're young and beautiful.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.666
We can do whatever we want!

22:21.790 --> 22:22.996
Full moon tonight.

22:23.130 --> 22:26.088
I say we trek into the hills
and get down with the goat people.

22:27.590 --> 22:30.890
"The key to any healthy organism
is the absorption of nutrients

22:31.010 --> 22:32.637
and the excretion of toxins.

22:32.760 --> 22:34.091
Look around your office.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.348
Who are the nutrients? Absorb them.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.630
Who are the toxins? Excrete them."

22:42.110 --> 22:44.477
So, where did Janet come from?

22:45.740 --> 22:47.139
Nobody knows for sure.

22:47.570 --> 22:50.904
Some say she was raised
in an orphanage in the Himalayas.

22:53.370 --> 22:54.576
She went to Stanford.

22:55.370 --> 22:58.112
-Is she really only 30?
-No. She lies about her age.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.706
She's actually 25.

23:00.460 --> 23:03.122
She's afraid of being pigeonholed
as a wunderkid.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.506
Hey, did you...

23:07.050 --> 23:08.870
Did you hurt your toe or something?

23:09.930 --> 23:11.329
No. Why?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.307
I mean, it looks a little...

23:15.350 --> 23:16.385
-You know.
-Oh, that?

23:16.520 --> 23:19.592
That's just a...
nasty toenail fungus.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.202
It's time, Captain.

23:43.170 --> 23:44.456
You got to let me know.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.376
Are we doing this?

23:50.380 --> 23:51.211
Yep.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.335
You're my guy, Ernie.

23:55.050 --> 23:57.178
Orbis is all yours, pipe to trim.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.426
Give me your card.
We'll talk details later.

24:12.700 --> 24:13.906
Where are you going?

24:14.410 --> 24:15.571
I'm going to the john.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.577
Last I checked,
you still work for me.

24:18.160 --> 24:19.366
I need a driver.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.700
Yeah, OK.

24:36.640 --> 24:37.755
M al am?

24:37.890 --> 24:38.880
I'm sorry.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.260
Are you all right?

24:41.390 --> 24:42.516
"Malam."

24:42.640 --> 24:44.301
Oh, God.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.049
I'm alumni.

24:48.940 --> 24:50.180
Don't ask what year.

24:54.780 --> 24:56.737
So, what brings you back?

24:57.910 --> 25:00.151
My locker was...

25:01.660 --> 25:02.786
right over there.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.878
My idiot high-school boyfriend
used to...

25:07.880 --> 25:09.291
leave me love letters.

25:11.300 --> 25:12.415
I still have them.

25:14.550 --> 25:16.587
Yeah, I think I know what you mean.

25:16.720 --> 25:18.961
Sometimes
I'll just be walking down the halls,

25:19.100 --> 25:20.590
and it's like time slips.

25:21.140 --> 25:23.222
I'm 15 again, late for class.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.187
Look, ma'am,
you can't be driving like this.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.357
Is there somebody I can call
to pick you up?

26:15.650 --> 26:16.697
Damn!

26:16.820 --> 26:18.060
You are rich.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.946
Only financially.

26:20.570 --> 26:22.698
Stay put.
I'm just gonna grab a few things.

26:24.790 --> 26:25.780
OK.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.177
Twelve down.

26:39.590 --> 26:41.467
"Chinese dynasty."

26:43.180 --> 26:46.423
-Chinese...
-I left my keys back at the trailer.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.517
-I'm gonna use the back gate.
-OK.

26:50.100 --> 26:51.556
Chinese dynasty. Ming.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.438
Ming. Twelve down. Ming.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.021
Ming. Ming.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.480
Fifty down.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.241
"Arm bone."

27:08.910 --> 27:10.321
Arm bone.

27:10.750 --> 27:11.740
Ulna?

27:19.930 --> 27:20.920
Ulna.

27:22.220 --> 27:23.210
Ulna.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.011
Yep.

27:26.970 --> 27:29.883
Was the back gate locked
or something?

27:40.820 --> 27:42.481
Come in.
Might as well hang for a bit.

27:44.410 --> 27:45.400
OK.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.950
Hey...

27:52.330 --> 27:53.320
man.

27:53.460 --> 27:55.588
-Are you OK or--
-Don't worry about the door.

27:56.750 --> 27:57.956
It's just a door.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.922
I can use my money
to buy another door.

28:03.840 --> 28:07.253
There's cold cuts in the fridge if
you're hungry, but no bread, though.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.058
Brenda doesn't allow bread
in our home anymore.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.976
Hey, where is Brenda?

28:13.100 --> 28:16.980
Oh, she's out with her precious
graduate assistants, Jill and Barry.

28:17.110 --> 28:19.067
They're tagging seals

28:19.190 --> 28:20.942
or jerking off dolphins or...

28:21.820 --> 28:23.481
whatever it is they do together.

28:26.450 --> 28:29.863
She cares more about sea mammals

28:30.000 --> 28:31.786
than she ever cared about me.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.668
Sure you're OK, man?
Because it seems like--

28:34.790 --> 28:35.996
She kicked me out, Dud.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.548
-This isn't our home anymore.
-Hey.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.370
It's OK.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.791
It's all right. Hey...

28:44.930 --> 28:47.046
Could you loosen
your grip on me, because...

28:47.720 --> 28:48.926
You did it, Ernie!

28:49.520 --> 28:50.806
You landed Captain!

28:50.930 --> 28:52.011
I did.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.551
But let's not sit back.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.431
I want to get ahead on everything.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.562
Bob, you get the factories
up to speed.

28:57.690 --> 28:59.601
I'm going to see Captain's architect.

28:59.730 --> 29:03.234
I'll get the spec sheets from him
and start acing out the pricing.

29:04.700 --> 29:07.237
- Let this man be
an inspiration to all of you.

29:07.950 --> 29:10.362
Sure, you're looking at Ernie,
thinking,

29:10.490 --> 29:12.322
"Here's a middle-aged nobody

29:12.460 --> 29:15.669
on the downslope
of a mediocre career.

29:16.170 --> 29:17.376
Who cares?"

29:17.880 --> 29:18.870
Well, I care...

29:19.550 --> 29:21.336
because he's about to land

29:21.460 --> 29:24.919
the biggest order in the history
of West Coast Super Sales.

29:26.180 --> 29:27.386
In my book,

29:27.510 --> 29:29.342
Ernie Fontaine is a hero.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.511
-Yeah!
-Yeah, yeah!

29:33.180 --> 29:36.639
It's what I've termed
"The Three Cs" of Omni West:

29:36.770 --> 29:39.148
Comfort, community,

29:39.270 --> 29:42.023
and that which makes
both of them possible...

29:42.740 --> 29:43.559
craft.

29:43.690 --> 29:45.397
-These are the values--
-Fine.

29:46.530 --> 29:47.349
Fine.

29:47.990 --> 29:50.027
But tell me what's underneath...

29:51.040 --> 29:52.326
"The Three Cs."

29:54.410 --> 29:55.992
-Underneath?
-Hey!

29:56.120 --> 29:57.531
This is the vivisection.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.779
Flay the skin.

29:59.920 --> 30:01.160
You have one chance.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.047
Comfort,

30:05.170 --> 30:06.171
community--

30:24.490 --> 30:26.106
OK, well,

30:26.240 --> 30:28.811
I can only really speak for Shamroxx,

30:28.950 --> 30:31.362
where I've been working
as a waitress.

30:32.910 --> 30:35.197
I wasn't there to do research.

30:36.080 --> 30:39.243
Or I guess you could say
I was doing unintentional research,

30:39.380 --> 30:41.121
which is just life.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.956
Anyway, I have a shitload of debt,

30:45.090 --> 30:47.127
and I needed the cash, so...

30:47.720 --> 30:49.040
So, yeah,

30:49.180 --> 30:51.842
we've got "The Three Cs," sure,

30:51.970 --> 30:55.554
plus all the TVs and the fried food.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.763
The main thing, of course -
and we can't forget this - is tits.

31:00.810 --> 31:03.108
But if we're gonna ask ourselves

31:03.230 --> 31:05.187
what's underneath the tits

31:05.320 --> 31:06.731
and everything else,

31:06.860 --> 31:08.237
I'd have to say...

31:10.660 --> 31:12.901
loneliness and despair.

31:14.490 --> 31:16.538
It's like we're all bound together -

31:16.660 --> 31:19.322
pervy customers, staff.

31:20.870 --> 31:22.031
We all kind of...

31:23.040 --> 31:24.792
wash up on the same shore.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.581
My mom died when I was a year old

31:30.720 --> 31:32.427
and my dad died last year, and...

31:37.980 --> 31:38.970
sorry.

31:39.100 --> 31:41.808
I don't know what I'm saying now.

31:43.230 --> 31:44.265
Don't be.

31:46.030 --> 31:47.145
It's beautiful.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.677
Like I said,
there's no Kaplan Architects here.

32:11.800 --> 32:13.711
-There never has been.
-But that's crazy.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.093
I had a meeting there
a few weeks ago.

32:16.220 --> 32:19.474
You know what's even crazier?
This building burned down in 1987.

32:20.230 --> 32:21.345
I'm a ghost.

32:22.310 --> 32:23.800
Sorry. Little joke.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.351
The office
has been abandoned for months.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.949
So, what's Brenda's problem?

32:34.070 --> 32:36.573
Her big complaint about me
is that I'm a total fraud.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.531
Why would she say that?

32:39.660 --> 32:41.321
Because I commit a lot of fraud.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.991
But not more
than anybody else, I think.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.452
She's just become more
and more judgmental.

32:47.210 --> 32:49.042
Man, I don't know
what happened with us.

32:49.170 --> 32:52.720
I guess it's naive to think that two
people evolve the same emotionally,

32:52.840 --> 32:55.081
but it's not like I had
a bunch of affairs.

32:55.510 --> 32:58.309
It was just the one.
And after a while, it meant nothing.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.551
I'll never figure out
what went wrong.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.885
It was probably the affair.

33:04.770 --> 33:06.101
Our careers ate us up.

33:06.690 --> 33:07.930
We lost track of each other.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.391
We've got the house,
the money - everything.

33:10.940 --> 33:12.692
But it's all the wrong stuff,
you know?

33:14.610 --> 33:16.408
-You need to get back to Spain.
-No.

33:16.530 --> 33:18.658
-Yeah.
-Spain was just a dream.

33:18.780 --> 33:20.782
I'm not that guy anymore.
Not even close.

33:21.290 --> 33:23.156
Man, with the shit
I'm involved in now...

33:25.040 --> 33:28.032
Dud, I've lost my duende
and there's no way to get it back.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.831
-Oh, you can get it back.
-How?

33:29.960 --> 33:31.416
With your eyes, man.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.878
Yeah, with your eyes.
That's what the Lodge is all about.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.500
OK.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.251
But how? You talking the Magnum Opus?

33:39.850 --> 33:41.136
Harwood Fritz Merrill?

33:45.770 --> 33:47.181
I don't... Yeah, I don't know.

33:47.310 --> 33:49.392
You know,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.933
It's just, I think that,
maybe with you and Brenda,

33:53.070 --> 33:55.858
the divorce is, like,

33:55.990 --> 33:58.982
the thing that might need to happen,
you know?

34:06.040 --> 34:07.917
-Hey, Ernie.
-Captain's a fraud!

34:08.040 --> 34:09.951
He's playing
some kind of twisted game!

34:10.090 --> 34:11.239
Stay away from him!

34:11.670 --> 34:13.627
Hey, Ernie. It's Gary.

34:14.340 --> 34:15.795
Dud has you on speakerphone.

34:17.679 --> 34:18.670
Shit.

34:19.219 --> 34:21.962
But you're right, I am a fraud,
and I am playing a twisted game.

34:23.389 --> 34:24.972
Come by the house. I'll explain.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.591
-Congratulations, Elizabeth.
-Thank you.

35:13.770 --> 35:16.398
Presenting... the Essence.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.156
Isn't this place great?

35:26.700 --> 35:28.532
Brenda's got a thing for narwhals.

35:29.080 --> 35:31.458
Sailors of yore called them
the unicorns of the sea.

35:31.750 --> 35:34.663
They thought the tusk had
magical properties. Don't touch that.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.835
That still works.

35:36.630 --> 35:39.213
Just tell me
why I couldn't find Kaplan.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.716
Have a seat, fellas.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.510
Thanks, Gary.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.187
You couldn't find Kaplan...

35:54.310 --> 35:56.017
because Kaplan doesn't exist.

35:56.570 --> 35:59.358
And Kaplan doesn't exist
because this whole Orbis deal

35:59.490 --> 36:01.948
is really just a huge scam.

36:03.780 --> 36:05.327
There is no redevelopment.

36:07.490 --> 36:10.573
But what about the billboards?
You can't just put up billboards.

36:11.000 --> 36:11.819
Can you?

36:11.960 --> 36:15.703
So you set this all up
to con money out of investors.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.332
No. Ernie, I'm a patsy, believe me.

36:18.460 --> 36:21.919
You think I'm hard to find? The guys
that I work for are freaking shadows.

36:22.050 --> 36:23.711
You met them at the Kaplan office.

36:23.840 --> 36:26.719
The... The gift basket guys.

36:26.850 --> 36:28.966
That's right.
I got a gift basket, too.

36:29.100 --> 36:31.683
I don't even know who they work for.
Shells within shells.

36:31.810 --> 36:34.939
So they're gonna soak
the investors and take off.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.767
No, it's worse than that.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.720
OK, fellas, here's what happened.

36:39.610 --> 36:40.930
You got to believe me.

36:41.070 --> 36:42.856
So, these guys tracked me down.

36:42.990 --> 36:46.199
They know I can pull levers around
here. I can make projects seem legit.

36:46.620 --> 36:48.190
City, county, state.

36:48.330 --> 36:51.868
Now, was there something off
about these guys? Yeah.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.822
But they gave me a nice fee up front
and a fat-ass back end,

36:54.960 --> 36:56.030
so, "What the hell?"

36:56.170 --> 36:57.660
You live in a moral gray area.

36:57.790 --> 36:59.792
-Correct.
-It's how you lost your duende.

36:59.920 --> 37:00.955
Correct again.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.428
Yeah, so, anyway, I take the money.

37:04.550 --> 37:05.961
They pay me in Bitcoin.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.388
It's all very slick.
So, I start making calls.

37:09.100 --> 37:11.762
They take me aside.
"Hey, we're not gonna build anything.

37:11.890 --> 37:12.937
This is all a charade.”

37:14.230 --> 37:17.609
Now, our gift basket guys gave me
some very valuable information.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.278
That land under Orbis is toxic.

37:22.400 --> 37:23.856
You can't build anything.

37:24.450 --> 37:25.815
But they paid off a geologist

37:25.950 --> 37:29.409
just to come up with some bogus
environmental-impact report

37:29.530 --> 37:31.157
and then pitch it to the city.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.280
OK, but then...

37:33.080 --> 37:35.321
then why lie to Ernie?

37:35.460 --> 37:37.952
Why string him along like that?

37:44.300 --> 37:45.586
Because I'm lonely, OK?

37:46.720 --> 37:48.927
I mean, I had a blast with you guys.

37:49.050 --> 37:50.381
Most fun I've had in years.

37:50.510 --> 37:51.921
I didn't want it to end.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.550
I was gonna tell you eventually.

37:53.890 --> 37:56.348
-And I'm gonna make it up to you.
-Too late, man.

37:56.480 --> 37:57.550
I'm sorry.

37:57.980 --> 38:00.938
But... we've got to say something.

38:01.730 --> 38:03.778
Tell the city, the newspapers.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.403
Fine. Go ahead.
But that's exactly what they expect.

38:06.530 --> 38:09.568
It's part of their plan. They're
moving pieces around on the board.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.986
Here's what's gonna happen.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.748
The story comes out.
Headlines, scandal.

38:13.870 --> 38:17.033
These guys disappear
and let the patsies take the hit.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.662
Then they come back with
a brand-new shell corporation

38:19.790 --> 38:22.669
that buys the same piece of property
for pennies on the dollar.

38:23.460 --> 38:27.579
Why would you go through all that
trouble just to buy the land anyway?

38:28.010 --> 38:29.080
Because...

38:29.640 --> 38:32.553
if you want to break
someone completely,

38:32.680 --> 38:34.170
you get their hopes up first.

38:35.270 --> 38:36.806
You tell them the land is gold.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.760
When it turns out to be lead,

38:38.900 --> 38:40.299
it will never be cheaper.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.931
Why would you want to buy toxic land?

38:44.070 --> 38:45.185
For what's under it.

38:45.990 --> 38:46.980
Oil.

38:47.110 --> 38:48.942
Orbis land has never been tapped.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.743
These guys were following me around
while I followed them around.

38:54.870 --> 38:58.033
Out in Paramount, there's a warehouse
that is stocking the biggest,

38:58.170 --> 39:00.207
gnarliest drilling equipment
you've seen.

39:00.330 --> 39:01.877
They're up to something. I know it.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.161
Well, good for them.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.416
They get to enjoy
the bounty of Long Beach.

39:05.550 --> 39:06.790
They won't get a drop,

39:06.920 --> 39:08.376
because I'm gonna take it.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.928
The old Captain is three steps ahead.

39:11.050 --> 39:12.290
I got a guy in City Hall.

39:12.430 --> 39:14.671
As soon as the story breaks
about the toxic land,

39:14.810 --> 39:16.346
I'm gonna buy it out from under them

39:16.480 --> 39:19.051
and make myself
the richest asshole in SoCal.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.857
That won't help your duende problem.

39:21.980 --> 39:23.186
I can buy duende.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.277
Why are you telling us all this?

39:26.690 --> 39:29.239
Because I want to get you in
on the action. Invest with me.

39:30.110 --> 39:31.100
Give you money?

39:31.240 --> 39:34.574
Look, I'll spot you guys
a nice chunk of cash for the buy-in.

39:34.700 --> 39:37.442
Then I'll use your cockfight winnings
as collateral.

39:37.580 --> 39:40.288
We'll get it all on paper.
No more, no less.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.661
I'll get mine back
when the oil starts to flow.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.709
All T ask
is that you let me join the Lodge.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.877
I told you, it's probably closing.

39:50.010 --> 39:53.469
-We owe a bank in China 300 large.
-That's it?

39:53.600 --> 39:54.670
I'll tell you what.

39:55.060 --> 39:58.223
I'll pay it. I want to put money
back in the community. Duende.

39:58.350 --> 39:59.340
Duende.

40:02.190 --> 40:04.010
How do we know you aren't conning us?

40:04.150 --> 40:05.390
Because look around.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.983
I'm not going through this
to scam you out of a couple of grand.

40:09.110 --> 40:10.316
I don't need your money.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.066
This is about friendship, guys.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.362
You can back out anytime.
We can still hang.

40:14.490 --> 40:16.652
And, Ernie,
you're my guy, either way.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.531
_ I would love it
if you came to work for me.

40:20.120 --> 40:21.610
You've been selling a long time.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.451
You're ready to be the guy who buys.

40:33.760 --> 40:37.754
I think... we're both gonna be rich.

40:37.890 --> 40:40.052
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's like this whole thing...

40:40.180 --> 40:41.386
Was meant to be? Yeah.

40:41.520 --> 40:43.978
Larry said something big
was gonna happen. This is it.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.397
-You know what?
-This is it.

40:45.520 --> 40:47.431
You're right. God, help me!

40:47.570 --> 40:48.810
You are right, man!

40:49.280 --> 40:50.350
You are right!

40:50.490 --> 40:52.106
-We're gonna be rich!
-OK.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.230
Oh, my God!

40:57.700 --> 40:59.782
Liz, I didn't even recognize you.

40:59.910 --> 41:01.071
I mean, you look so...

41:01.870 --> 41:03.577
important-looking.

41:03.710 --> 41:04.529
Thanks.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.786
I should give you crap
for signing with a major,

41:06.920 --> 41:09.241
but, luckily,
no one cares about that anymore,

41:09.380 --> 41:11.508
because nothing
means anything anymore.

41:11.630 --> 41:13.291
Oh, Champ, you're gonna make me cry.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.506
I should be pissed, too.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.598
They never offered me
a chance at Corporate.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.677
But I'm working on
getting over myself.

41:21.850 --> 41:25.184
And you absolutely deserve this, Liz.

41:25.310 --> 41:26.687
We're all real proud of you.

41:27.690 --> 41:28.851
Thank you.

41:31.110 --> 41:33.238
OK, I should let you guys
get back to work.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.486
Yeah, OK.

41:37.910 --> 41:38.900
Hey, Liz.

41:39.450 --> 41:40.827
No matter what happens...

41:41.620 --> 41:43.247
you'll always have a home with us.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.340
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:04.390 --> 42:05.380
Hey.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.390
How have you been?

42:08.980 --> 42:10.391
Good. You?

42:11.360 --> 42:12.680
Good. I'm good.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.486
Why are you all dressed up?

42:17.490 --> 42:18.696
Why are you here?

42:19.950 --> 42:21.076
Listen,

42:21.200 --> 42:24.113
I wanted to let you know that,
soon, I'll be able to help you out.

42:24.910 --> 42:26.787
You know, I'm gonna pay you back.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.243
That's not you helping me, that's you
doing what you're supposed to do.

42:31.380 --> 42:33.587
And T'll be able to pay off
your note at the bank.

42:34.010 --> 42:35.216
And...

42:35.340 --> 42:38.423
I'm going to get Dad's shop back.

42:41.260 --> 42:42.307
You're wondering how.

42:43.770 --> 42:47.092
I can't go into specifics right now
because it's just too complex.

42:47.690 --> 42:49.897
But, basically, because of the Lodge,

42:50.020 --> 42:51.931
I am now a stakeholder

42:52.070 --> 42:55.062
<i>in a major real-estate acquisition.</i>

42:55.820 --> 42:58.482
Good for you.
But I don't need your help.

42:58.950 --> 43:00.770
No. I've been distilled.

43:01.990 --> 43:04.448
Yeah. I'm the Essence, Brother.

43:04.580 --> 43:08.460
I am about to bank some serious bank.

43:08.580 --> 43:11.572
Oh, yeah.
Salary, benefits, the whole way.

43:12.460 --> 43:13.950
That's good news.

43:14.090 --> 43:14.909
Yeah.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.449
I guess we're both doing...

43:17.420 --> 43:18.421
great.

43:19.510 --> 43:20.500
Yeah!

43:33.770 --> 43:34.760
Hey.

43:44.450 --> 43:45.485
Glad you're here.

43:49.410 --> 43:50.411
Yeah.

43:51.330 --> 43:53.913
Everyone went home early tonight,
so I'm just...

43:54.790 --> 43:55.791
hanging out.

43:57.170 --> 43:58.660
I heard Band Night's still on.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.871
I'm looking forward
to hearing you guys play.

44:01.930 --> 44:03.045
Got any new stuff?

44:05.060 --> 44:07.176
Ernie, I need you
to do something for me.

44:07.970 --> 44:09.176
Sure, anything.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.852
I need you to start sleeping
with Connie again.
