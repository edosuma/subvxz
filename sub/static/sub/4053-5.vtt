00:02.211 --> 00:04.179
I hear you're interviewing
replacements this morning. lam.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.346
HARVEY: You good
at what you do?

00:05.422 --> 00:06.469
I'm great at what I do.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.595
Then you start tomorrow.

00:08.132 --> 00:10.886
I'd like to propose a change to
the current compensation formula.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.312
How many partners do you
have in your pocket

00:12.387 --> 00:13.730
if we put your
proposal to a vote?

00:13.805 --> 00:15.182
I can get 45%.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.437
I'm going to get
you the difference.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.190
This is Harvey's <i>last</i>
three income statements,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.020
and I found them sitting
in the copy machine.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.400
LOUIS: You came
to work for me.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.778
So, now, it's time for you to decide.
Are you with me or not?

00:23.857 --> 00:26.861
I just called for a vote, and I
hope you've been saving your money.

00:26.944 --> 00:29.197
Because your gravy train's
about to leave the station.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.747
MIKE: Okay, I'm dialing 911.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.287
It's not a heart attack.
It's a panic attack.

00:33.492 --> 00:37.087
Remember when I said if I wanted you
to make up for the compensation vote,

00:37.162 --> 00:38.254
I would come
to you directly?

00:38.330 --> 00:39.582
Well, now, I am.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.087
Well, let's take a
look at your resume.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.965
Witness tampering,
extortion, bribery.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.383
Forgery fits right in.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.964
I actually looked
into your mommy.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.808
And it turns out that the whole
time you were home with Daddy,

00:49.883 --> 00:50.975
Mommy was out banging...

01:09.361 --> 01:12.661

a little while...</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.791
<i>So, tell me what
you want to do</i>

Hey, Harv,
how's it going?

01:23.667 --> 01:28.514

me all your love...</i>

01:30.132 --> 01:34.979

01:36.847 --> 01:38.520
DR. AGARD: You're
absolutely certain

01:38.599 --> 01:40.852
the man was this
Travis Tanner person.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.110
Yes.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.277
And yet, you're
just as certain

01:43.353 --> 01:44.525
the woman wasn't Donna.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.820
That's what I said.
I know that.

01:47.316 --> 01:49.193
But you haven't
said who she was.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.113
Why are you looking
at me like that?

01:52.446 --> 01:53.663
You know why.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.033
I don't know who she was.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.576
Okay, then,
let's try this.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.375
Why do you think Travis
Tanner all of a sudden

02:00.454 --> 02:02.127
popped into
your subconscious?

02:02.664 --> 02:04.883
Because I'm in the middle
of a case against him.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.591
Well, since you don't want to
talk about the dream anymore,

02:07.669 --> 02:09.467
why don't we talk
about the case?

02:23.018 --> 02:24.816
I was just wondering why
you changed your hair.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.192
Hair's the same as
it's always been.

Hey, I just stopped by to give you a
little gift for winning the Zane case.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.701
A gift? You've never given
me a gift after a case.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.910
That's not true.
Come to think of it,

02:39.993 --> 02:41.415
you've never even
congratulated me,

02:41.495 --> 02:43.418
which means you're
actually here because...

02:43.538 --> 02:44.915
Oh, my god.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.041
You miss me.

02:46.124 --> 02:47.797

Not miss you.

That's it? My gift looks
a lot like a folder.

It's a case.

Well, what are
we waiting for?

Nothing. He's on
his way over with

right now.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.026
Settlement? 
That doesn't
sound like Tanner.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.653
It sounds exactly
like Tanner.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.659
How is that? He's starting
off waving a white flag.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.532
And he's doing it
just to go behind our backs

03:14.611 --> 03:15.783
so he can
attack our flank.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.205
So, you're saying we
need to watch our flank.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.953
No, I'm saying we
need to attack his.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.580
What?
I'm just going to say it.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.675
Every time we go up against
Tanner, it gets brutal.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.543

what you need right now?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.725

I need right now.

That is a token
of my appreciation.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.986
You told me to trust Harvey
with Esther and you were right.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.195
Now, Harvey
and I are good.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.488
Well, if you're going
to give me a gift

03:58.572 --> 03:59.744

out to be right,

03:59.823 --> 04:01.325
then I'm going to need

04:18.216 --> 04:20.685
You and me,
side by side,

04:20.802 --> 04:22.019
completely naked,

the juices of mother earth.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.226
Oh, yeah. Now, I can see exactly
how it's totally appropriate.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.435
Exactly.

in the deep warmth of my mud,

be the same again.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.253
Jessica, we have a problem.
I went through the bylaws.

04:46.536 --> 04:48.038
It turns out the new
compensation structure

04:48.121 --> 04:49.964
is in violation of
subsection C-35,

04:50.040 --> 04:51.508
so the vote
in itself was moot.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.591
So, you're saying we're going back
to the old compensation structure?

04:55.086 --> 04:56.212
No, I'm not saying that.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.969
Subsection C-35
is saying that.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.383
There's only one problem.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.515
Subsection C-35
didn't exist 24 hours ago.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.312
Jessica...
Cut the shit, Louis.

is really about.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.354
It's about me trying to make
things right with Harvey.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.858
And I have no
problem with that.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.607
But I also need you to
make things right with me.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.366
What are you talking about?

05:17.442 --> 05:19.069
That vote was an
assault on my power.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.321
I sneak this by, I don't
get my power back.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.077
It just makes me the
same as you and Jack.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.117
So, you're not going
to undo this thing

05:25.200 --> 05:26.372
the same shady way

05:26.451 --> 05:27.919
that the two of you passed
it in the first place.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.208
Jessica, I told you

05:29.287 --> 05:31.881
leaving Harvey's
compensation in the copier

05:31.998 --> 05:33.090
was an accident.

leaves presents under trees.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.299
Okay, fine. I get it.
You don't believe me.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.266
But how the hell am I supposed
to convince the senior partners

05:42.342 --> 05:44.265
to take money out
of their own pockets?

05:44.427 --> 05:45.599
That's your problem.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.644

reverse that policy,

05:47.764 --> 05:49.266

you walked right past

I can do.

Get Harvey to ask me
for something else.

No, not an option.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.275
Donna, the only way

07:14.351 --> 07:15.898
I can get this clone is
with Jack Soloff's help.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.570
And there is no way that
he's going to reverse

07:17.646 --> 07:18.647
the very same proposal

07:18.730 --> 07:19.982
that put him on the map.

would do.

I don't care

07:23.652 --> 07:24.619
what Harvey would do

07:24.694 --> 07:26.367
because I cannot do
what Harvey would do.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.452
What would Harvey do?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.329
He'd find a way to
make it worth Jack's while.

know some people never change.

care about my client.

have tried to launch

a company with
stolen IP.

That IP
wasn't stolen.

it herself.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.003
It doesn't matter whether
she created it or not.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.173
She signed a contract
that says we own it

08:18.248 --> 08:21.252
and it was on our laptop that
she took home on her last day.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.586
And we're not letting you walk
out the door with our property.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.343
Okay. I told you,
this isn't about me.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.469
Okay. What do
you want, Tanner?

08:26.548 --> 08:27.674
I want to make an offer.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.974
Alyssa is willing
to give you

08:29.050 --> 08:30.927
a 15% stake to
drop this whole thing.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.563
She can make it 100% for all I care.
We're not settling.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.639
You don't have to settle

08:34.806 --> 08:36.149
but you do have
to present that offer

08:36.224 --> 08:37.350
to your client
and you know it.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.278
I will. I just need to get it
translated from bullshit to English.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.071
Harvey, look at me.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.193
That's a fair offer.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.487
No, you look at
me and tell me

08:44.566 --> 08:46.739
you're not doing something
behind our backs right now.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.070
I'm not.
Well, we are.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.243
Your secretary said you wouldn't
file a TRO until after this meeting.

08:51.322 --> 08:54.792
Oh, we didn't. No, it turns out that
Miss Lang has some outstanding debts.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.213
So, we just went ahead and bought those
up and put a lien on her property.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.628
The Sheriff is padlocking
her offices as we speak.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.755
Harvey, don't do this.
You'll be sorry.

09:02.834 --> 09:06.088
Tell that to the judge. We're
filing that TRO in the morning.

09:10.675 --> 09:11.972
I'm telling you,

09:12.135 --> 09:13.978
I'm not the guy
I used to be.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.648
But if you hit me, I'm not
turning the other cheek.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.520
You're going to get hit back.

09:24.314 --> 09:25.736
What are you
so happy about?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.658
I told you, it's
exactly what I needed.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.535
You've gone up against
this man how many times?

09:33.698 --> 09:35.291
Enough to know
that he's a piece of shit

09:35.366 --> 09:37.209
that will cross whatever
line it takes to win.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.830
All I've heard so far is
the line that you crossed.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.837
Listen, you may understand
some things about people,

09:43.333 --> 09:44.960
but you don't
understand what I do.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.589
Well, it sounds to me like what you did was
attack a man that was waving a white flag.

09:48.671 --> 09:49.672
Were you listening?

09:49.839 --> 09:52.513
He wasn't waving a white
flag, he was setting us up.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.302
How can you be so sure?

09:54.427 --> 09:55.519
Because I know Tanner.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.189
Okay. Well, if you know so
well what he was capable of,

09:58.264 --> 10:00.392
why was it such a good idea
to pick a fight with him?

10:00.850 --> 10:02.523
Because it's what I do.

10:02.727 --> 10:06.072
Well, maybe it's time to
consider changing what you do.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.908
Okay, here we go. What about
Gentech and Orion Pharmaceuticals?

10:11.986 --> 10:15.081
Monster merger, contingent
fee, and huge upside.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.999
And Cravath is listed as
the attorney of record,

10:17.075 --> 10:20.124
which means if they swap out,
it blows the whole thing up.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.204
Okay, well,
that's the last one.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.463
Shit.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.667
Wait. This has been
here the whole time.

10:25.750 --> 10:26.797
What about John Dellmore?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.048
They're merging
with Arkin Financial,

10:28.128 --> 10:29.220
it hasn't been
announced yet.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.296
It's just sitting there
ripe for the taking.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.929
No, not going to happen. Dellmore's
been with Harmon and Shupe for decades.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.510
So what? Harmon and Shupe is a third
tier law firm and Shupe is a joke.

10:35.593 --> 10:37.186
She's also John
Dellmore's wife.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.398
Well, so then, maybe we can convince
Dellmore that his wife is a trollop.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.941
Louis!
Goddamn it.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.226
What is going on?

10:43.309 --> 10:46.313
I need Jack Soloff to overturn
the compensation vote.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.821
And the only way for me to do that is
to bring in a big contingent client.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.025
And share
the money with him.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.203
Exactly. And none of
these people are it.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.529
Okay. (SIGHS)

10:55.321 --> 10:56.447
Wait. Where are you going?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.666
Like you said, none of
these people are it.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.252
It's late, we're both exhausted, and
I've got a test in the morning.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.546
Rachel, please.
Louis, I'm sorry.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.248
We'll work on it tomorrow
morning, I promise.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.590
Rach.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.719
(SIGHS)

11:11.671 --> 11:14.015
Gentlemen, I don't like granting
TROs without a good reason.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.216
We have a good reason,
Your Honor.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.347
It's called a contract.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.848
A contract that
explicitly states

11:17.927 --> 11:20.806
that any product Alyssa Lang
developed during her employment

11:20.889 --> 11:22.186
is the property
of our client.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.518
Unfortunately, that
contract is unenforceable.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.400
It is unless, I woke up
in Russia this morning.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.649
Your Honor, I have here a copy of
Alyssa Lang's birth certificate.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.780
She may have signed that
contract, but it isn't binding

11:32.859 --> 11:34.782
because she was
only 16 at the time.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.203
What?

11:36.279 --> 11:37.906
Your Honor,
I know this man,

11:37.989 --> 11:39.662
and that document could
have come from anywhere.

11:39.782 --> 11:41.329
Get it verified by
the labs at Quantico.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.754
All it's going to prove is that Alyssa
Lang had no legal capacity to sign.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.708
It doesn't matter how old she was when
she signed it, it was ten years ago.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.043
She's cashed every
paycheck she got since.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.469
JUDGE: And you can
argue that at trial.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.046
But we have laws
protecting minors

11:53.129 --> 11:54.802
for a reason and I'm
not granting a TRO.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.090
And one more thing,
Your Honor.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.801
We have payment in full,
discharging her debt,

11:57.884 --> 11:59.636
and are requesting her
doors be reopened.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.645
That has nothing to do
with why we're here.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.065
Save it for trial,
Mr. Specter. It's lunch,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.438
I'm hungry, and those padlocks
are coming off today.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.518
(GAVEL BANGS)

12:08.811 --> 12:09.983
What the hell was that?

12:10.104 --> 12:12.653
That was the sound of your
face hitting the canvas.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.071
I suggest you stay down.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.240
I'm not staying anywhere,
you son of a bitch.

12:16.903 --> 12:17.995
Excuse me?
You heard me.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.994
Your client
was 16 years old

12:20.073 --> 12:22.792
and you conveniently left that
out of your changed man speech.

12:22.867 --> 12:26.121
I didn't tell you about her because I knew
you wouldn't listen to a thing I said

12:26.287 --> 12:28.710
after I offered you a fair deal
and you told me to go to hell.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.835
Bullshit. You didn't tell us because
you wanted to blind-side us in court.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.920
Hey, you're the one who turned the
lights out on Alyssa's business

12:34.003 --> 12:35.425
while I was extending
an olive branch.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.678
Bullshit again. We both
know that settlement offer

12:37.757 --> 12:39.225
was nothing but
a distraction.

12:39.968 --> 12:40.969
(SCOFFS)

12:41.302 --> 12:42.895
You want a distraction?

12:43.888 --> 12:46.482
That is a draft of Alyssa
Lang's sexual harassment

12:46.557 --> 12:48.059
complaint against
your client.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.816
And <i>as</i> far our offer goes,
it wasn't a distraction.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.694
Because we haven't filed that yet,
and our offer's still on the table.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.696
I advise you
to take it.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.583
You didn't believe the sexual
harassment aflegafion.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.251
Not a chance.
Why not?

13:09.372 --> 13:12.046
Well, for starters, it came
out of Tanner's mouth.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.882
And I know Tim Petroff, and
he didn't cheat on his wife.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.261
And you're angry
at him for that?

13:16.337 --> 13:19.716
You're damn right I am. There are
some things you just don't do.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.384
Like lie?

13:21.509 --> 13:23.603
Like threaten to rip
a man's family apart.

13:24.679 --> 13:25.805
Hmm.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.473
What?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.230
I just find it
interesting

13:29.309 --> 13:31.903
that you talk about family
as if it were sacred.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.275
Yet you've never married.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.943
You've never had
a family of your own.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.034
I don't see any macaroni paintings
or school pictures in here either.

13:38.109 --> 13:39.907
And my personal life
is not the topic here.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.613
So, why don't we
get back to what is?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.082
If it was such a good idea
to pick a fight with Tanner,

13:44.157 --> 13:47.377
why were you so angry at him for doing
exactly what you knew he would do?

13:47.785 --> 13:49.628
You're the doctor,
you tell me.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.247
Okay.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.001
Maybe because getting
angry at someone

13:54.083 --> 13:57.007
is a way to avoid facing
what's going on with yourself.

14:00.882 --> 14:02.099
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

14:04.927 --> 14:06.019
Oh, good, you're back.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.392
Can't be good
if you're out here.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.474
Well, I didn't want you to get ambushed.
There's a Tim...

14:09.557 --> 14:11.855
Tim Petroff of
BetaSoft in my office.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.854
He's been wearing out your
carpet for a half an hour.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.989
Tanner must have sent him
a copy of the complaint.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.114
If you mean that paper balled
up in his fist, I'd say he did.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.611
Thanks for the
heads up, Gretchen.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.700
Tim, before
you say anything...

14:26.783 --> 14:28.706
Sexual harassment?
What the hell is this?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.583
It's only a draft.
It hasn't been filed yet.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.288
And that's supposed to
make me feel better?

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
It's a goddamn lie.
I have never

14:34.415 --> 14:36.417
done anything remotely
resembling harassing anyone.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.718
Tim. Calm down.
I want you to...

14:37.794 --> 14:39.296
I'm not going
to calm down.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.639
This is a complete
twisting of who I am.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.471
I want this
woman destroyed.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.389
It's not her.
It's her lawyer.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.515
I don't care who it is.

14:46.594 --> 14:49.143
I have a wife and children
and I want this thing gone.

14:49.263 --> 14:50.810
Then, you should know there's
a settlement on the table.

14:50.890 --> 14:51.937
Mike, not now.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.017
What settlement?

14:53.101 --> 14:55.069
A 15% stake
in her venture.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.820
PETROFF: Are you
out of your mind?

14:56.938 --> 14:59.157
You think I'm going to settle with
these people based on blackmail?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.279
No one's settling.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.031
Yeah, you're damn right
no one's settling.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.784
Now, earn your money and blow
this woman out of the water.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.288
You heard him.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.998
Figure out a way to put the
screws to her once and for all.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.331
Harvey. And I don't want to hear
any shit about my state of mind.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.586
I'm not going to say
anything about that.

15:15.665 --> 15:18.509
But what I will say is that if
Tanner's willing to make her do this,

15:18.584 --> 15:20.928
what's to say he's not willing
to make her do something worse?

15:21.045 --> 15:22.763
What do you want to do, Mike?
You want to back down?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.432
No. I want to
get Tanner fired.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.184
It's not legal for
us to talk to her.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.349
There's no law against me
running into her by accident.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.356
Rachel, what are
you doing here?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.608
I've been looking
all over for you.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.736
Don't you mean, "Hey, Rachel,
how did your test go?"

15:40.815 --> 15:41.782
I don't care how
your test went.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.111
I just need you to get me everything
you can on John Dellmore.

15:44.193 --> 15:46.321
Louis, we've already
been over this.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.657
His lawyer is his wife. You're
never going to sign him.

15:48.739 --> 15:50.332
Well, that's just it. I
don't need to sign him.

15:50.408 --> 15:52.035
I only need to
pretend to sign him.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.209
Okay. That's a bad idea.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.414
No, it's not.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.133
If Jack thinks
I've signed Dellmore

15:59.208 --> 16:00.755
and I tell him
I'll give him a piece,

16:00.835 --> 16:03.054
he'll know it's worth a fortune to
him and he'll overturn the vote.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.632
And what are you going to do when he
finds out the whole thing was a lie?

16:05.715 --> 16:07.558
He won't. I'll make
up some sob story

16:07.633 --> 16:10.307
about how Dellmore made up with his wife
and we'll live to fight another day.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.771
He's never going
to believe that.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.065
Rachel, Katrina would have been
onboard with this from day one.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.017
Okay. Louis, I'm sorry.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.272
lam not trying to
rain on your parade.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.398
But when Jack finds out,

16:18.478 --> 16:20.025
he is going to
hate you forever.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.357
Well, I made a
promise to Harvey.

16:22.523 --> 16:25.777
And if it's a choice between Jack
hating me and breaking that promise,

16:26.027 --> 16:27.700
I'm picking Harvey
every single time.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.748
What exactly do you need?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.246
I need a way to dazzle the
shit out of John Dellmore.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.495
Thank you.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.253
I don't understand,
my bill's been paid?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.875
Yes, sir, it has.
By who?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.384
Uh, by me.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.383
And who exactly are you?

16:44.712 --> 16:45.929
I'm Louis Litt.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.595
And not only did I
pay for your check,

16:48.758 --> 16:50.510
I also brought
you another one.

16:52.470 --> 16:53.517
(CHUCKLES)

16:53.596 --> 16:56.349
You're donating $50,000
to my charity.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.524
Yes.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.019
Why would you want to...

17:00.102 --> 17:02.446
Because it may not look like
it, but I was homeless.

17:03.439 --> 17:04.906
I spent two years
on the streets.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.983
And had it not been for
your family's organization,

17:07.068 --> 17:08.615
I would not be
the man I am today.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.118
Is there anything
I can do to thank you?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.782
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.247
You, sir.

17:16.618 --> 17:17.962
Are a true American hero.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.417
(CHUCKLES)

17:19.955 --> 17:21.299
Thank you.
Thank you.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.935
Oh, good, you're here.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.100
What the hell was that?

17:35.179 --> 17:36.772
That was John Dellmore.

17:36.847 --> 17:38.315
Yeah, I know who it is.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.475
Why was he
giving you a hug?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.819
Because I just convinced him
to let us handle his merger.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.111
Does that have something
to do with why we're here?

17:43.187 --> 17:44.564
It's got everything
to do with why we're here.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.984
Because I knew that you would never
believe that I could close Dellmore.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.785
(CHUCKLES) You're right.
If I hadn't seen it myself,

17:49.860 --> 17:50.986
I never would
have believed it.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.913
And why is that?
Because I'm a grinder?

17:54.574 --> 17:55.871
Here's the thing, Jack.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.329
When you took on Harvey, you pitted
the grinders against the rainmakers,

17:59.412 --> 18:00.413
and that was
a good move.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.419
But you want to move
to the next level,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.926
we need to be both
grinders and rainmakers.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.093
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

18:06.168 --> 18:07.385
What are you saying, Louis?

18:07.461 --> 18:09.429
lam saying that we need to revisit
the compensation agreement.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.973
No way.
Why would I do that?

18:11.048 --> 18:13.096
Because when we
get this business,

18:13.175 --> 18:15.223
it will be worth
a fortune to us.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.225
Us?
Yes, us.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.144
Jack, if you are
with me on this,

18:19.223 --> 18:22.022
I will give you fifty cents
to every dollar that I make.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.320
Yeah.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.318
Let's get this done.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.248
Careful,
that's really hot.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.130
A woman once sued McDonald's
for getting burned.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.297
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

18:44.373 --> 18:47.798
Although I guess you could just say
you got burned and sue them anyway.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.509
Who are you?

18:50.713 --> 18:52.932
It doesn't matter who I am.
It matters who I work for.

18:53.591 --> 18:54.683
Tim Petroff.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.057
You can't talk to me.
I'm just fixing my coffee.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.479
You want to walk
away, walk away.

18:58.554 --> 19:01.353
But before you do, I'm going
to say to nobody in particular

19:01.432 --> 19:03.105
that you should
fire your lawyer.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.523
I'm not firing anybody.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.604
Well, then, you should also know
that falsely accusing someone of

19:06.687 --> 19:08.485
sexual harassment
is a criminal offense.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.282
And no matter what
Travis Tanner has told you

19:10.358 --> 19:12.531
to convince you that
you'll get away with it,

19:12.693 --> 19:13.694
you won't.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.281
There's nothing in that complaint
that isn't factually correct.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.493
You are twisting those facts and you
could ruin a man's life and you know it.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.623
Oh. And how is that different
from what he's doing to me?

19:21.702 --> 19:22.954
It's completely different.

19:23.079 --> 19:26.333
Is it? I worked for that man
60 hours a week for 10 years.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.167
And now that I want to
start my own company,

19:28.250 --> 19:31.595
he not only wants to crush me, but
he told people I stole the idea.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.348
If that's not ruining a person's
life, then I don't know what is.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.592
Oh. And as far as
Travis Tanner goes,

19:36.717 --> 19:39.436
sexual harassment wasn't
his idea, it was mine.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.264
And when he tried
to talk me out of it,

19:41.430 --> 19:44.309
I told him he can either get onboard
or watch me get another lawyer.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.331
Rachel Zane,
you glorious creature.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.205
Glorious?
Yes, glorious.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.793
I mean, you were masterful.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.131
The charity,

20:08.249 --> 20:10.092
his lone lunches at
his favorite restaurant,

20:10.209 --> 20:11.961
having Jack show up
at the perfect time,

20:12.044 --> 20:14.388
I mean, you are not
only a brilliant attorney,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.220
you're the backbone
of this entire...

20:16.298 --> 20:17.720
Louis, I'm not going
mudding with you.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.268
Goddamn it. What did
Donna tell you?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.890
She told me that if it went
well, you would come in here

20:20.970 --> 20:22.313
trying to get
a celebratory mud.

20:22.388 --> 20:23.685
And that if it
didn't go well,

20:23.764 --> 20:25.607
you would try to get
a sympathy mud.

20:26.267 --> 20:27.564
Wait a second. I could have
gotten a sympathy mud?

20:27.643 --> 20:29.987
No, you couldn't.
But the good news is,

20:30.104 --> 20:31.105
you got what you
wanted with Jack.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.235
And on top of that, Louis,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.112
you really made
a difference

20:34.191 --> 20:35.659
in the lives of
homeless children.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.743
Which reminds me.
After the vote,

20:36.819 --> 20:38.162
I want you to put a stop
payment on that check.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.956
Okay. No. That is
a despicable thing to do.

20:41.157 --> 20:44.286
Please, any charity claiming to do a good
thing is clearly a scam. I won't have it.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.502
So, you mean you're cheap.
You know what?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.205
For someone who won't
throw me a sympathy mud,

20:47.288 --> 20:48.505
you're very judgmental.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.678
Louis, what can
I do for you?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.097
You can give me
your proxy.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.214
Why would I do that?

20:57.298 --> 21:01.053
Because you asked me to bring the
compensation issue up for a vote

21:01.135 --> 21:02.603
like a man and I did.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.972
And is Jack Soloff
aware of this?

21:04.054 --> 21:05.772
He's not only aware of it,
he's voting for it.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.858
And however did you
get him to do that?

21:07.975 --> 21:09.443
Let's just say that you
wanted me to do this

21:09.518 --> 21:11.862
like Harvey would have
and not like I would have.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.857
But I did
the best of both.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.696
Then, you have my proxy.

21:32.166 --> 21:33.634
Harvey, I talked
to Alyssa Lang

21:33.709 --> 21:35.086
and there's something
you should know.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.760
Let me guess. She batted her
eyes, told you a sob story,

21:37.838 --> 21:39.340
and now you think she's
some kind of innocent.

21:39.507 --> 21:43.853
No, I don't. In fact, she told me that
the sexual harassment idea was hers.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.680
And why do I
need to know that?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.728
I think we should
consider taking the deal.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.392
Well, we're not
going to do that.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.186
Why not?

21:52.269 --> 21:54.897
Because first of all, there's no way
on earth that Tim is going to settle.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.782
You could convince him
and you know it.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.986
And second of all, there's no way on
earth that that suit was her idea.

22:00.069 --> 22:01.286
Harvey, You weren't
there, all right?

22:01.362 --> 22:04.286
Yeah, I didn't have to be there to
know that if Tanner could convince her

22:04.365 --> 22:05.787
to do that bullshit
in the first place,

22:05.866 --> 22:07.994
he could sure <i>as</i> hell get
her to say it was her idea.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.704
He couldn't have known that
I was going to contact her.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.381
He could and he did and I don't
want to hear another word about it.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.879
And while you were away trying
to get her to cut him loose,

22:14.959 --> 22:18.964
I was here trying to figure out how to do
what Tim asked us to do and blow her away.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.769
Harvey, this isn't a joke.

22:30.391 --> 22:31.608
I'm not joking.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.730
The only way to get Tanner to back
down is to point a cannon in his face.

22:35.813 --> 22:38.657
You're not pointing it in his
face, you're pointing it in hers.

22:38.732 --> 22:41.110
And, and, and once you
put this in motion,

22:41.485 --> 22:43.829
there's no guarantee that you're
going to be able to pull it back.

22:44.113 --> 22:47.287
She should have thought of that
before she hired Travis Tanner.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.045
(WHISPERS) Listen, I'm going to
start by introducing the proposal,

22:55.124 --> 22:56.501
then you chime in.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.294
Jack, I gave you
50% of Dellmore,

22:58.419 --> 23:00.342
but I need to be seen as
leading the charge on this.

23:00.462 --> 23:03.056
Louis, I got the partners in line
by telling them it was my proposal.

23:03.132 --> 23:04.429
Okay. So, I'll introduce
you with my full support,

23:04.508 --> 23:05.976
and then you can
just take it from there.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.265
Okay.
Oh, and by the way,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.721
when we win this thing,

23:08.804 --> 23:10.522
maybe you and I can
go mudding together.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.645
Why don't we just
focus on the meeting?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.147
Right.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.029
First of all, I would like to
thank everyone for coming.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.398
The issue at hand is
a very important proposal

23:19.481 --> 23:20.903
that Jack and I have
been working on.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.285
I have both Harvey
and Jessica's proxies,

23:23.444 --> 23:25.412
and I am pleased to
say this measure

23:25.487 --> 23:27.160
has their full
support. Jack.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.324
Thank you, Louis.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.918
In light of the impact of
recent changes in the firm

23:30.993 --> 23:33.291
resulting from the new
compensation structure,

23:33.412 --> 23:35.085
Louis and I strongly feel

23:35.748 --> 23:37.091
that there should be
no new policy changes

23:37.166 --> 23:38.167
for the next 12 months.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.382
What?
And <i>as</i> Louis just said,

23:40.544 --> 23:41.921
the name partners
gave their blessing,

23:42.046 --> 23:44.720
so why don't we make it unanimous?
All in favor?

23:47.176 --> 23:48.769
The motion seems
to have passed.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.225
Next order of business.

23:56.268 --> 23:57.736
What the hell did
you just do?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.155
What the hell did I do? I
protected my own interests.

24:00.230 --> 24:02.278
We had a deal.
We didn't have a thing.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.702
You think I bought that John
Dellmore stunt at the restaurant?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.242
I was onto you the second
you walked over to my table

24:07.321 --> 24:08.868
and I let you
give me that

24:09.073 --> 24:11.747
bullshit speech about
grinders and rainmakers

24:11.867 --> 24:13.619
just so I could do
what I just did.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.913
Okay, I get it.

24:17.373 --> 24:20.126
You made your point and you
made a name for yourself.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.052
But, Jack, you
need to undo this.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.885
What makes you think I could have
undone it in the first place?

24:25.005 --> 24:28.134
They voted for that proposal because
it put more money in their pockets.

24:28.217 --> 24:29.685
And now,
it's there to stay.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.354
By the way, you want to
go mudding with someone,

24:32.429 --> 24:34.397
why don't you
ask Harvey Specter?

24:34.723 --> 24:37.192
Because it doesn't take
a genius to figure out

24:37.267 --> 24:40.737
that he's the one that got you to
carry his water in the first place.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.578
Thanks.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.992
I got you the special.

24:50.864 --> 24:52.832
Did you say no pickles?
You didn't say no pickles.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.286
I didn’t say order my lunch.
So, sue me.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.041
You send the notification
over to Tanner?

24:57.121 --> 24:59.089
Two hours ago.
Then, it won't be long.

25:02.459 --> 25:03.631
What?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.096
I didn't say anything about your
state of mind after Tim Petroff

25:06.171 --> 25:08.048
because I wasn't worried about it then.
But I am now.

25:08.132 --> 25:09.850
Mike.
What if it doesn't work?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.222
It will work.
And what if it doesn't?

25:11.343 --> 25:12.890
Then it's on Tanner.
No, it's on you.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.099
Because I'm telling you right now,
Tanner is not driving this thing.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.603
Well, speak of the devil.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.397
You son of a bitch.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.687
You filed criminal charges
against my client?

25:21.770 --> 25:22.862
You're damn right we did.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.942
She forged a fake driver's license
and attached it to her W2.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.819
That's ten years of tax fraud.
Oh, you piece of shit.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.571
This is crossing
the line even for you.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.372
For me? Ever since
the day I met you,

25:32.448 --> 25:33.825
all you've done
is cross lines.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.001
And it started with you
ripping off cancer victims.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.669
Not to mention every other
thing you've ever done.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.964
Hey. I told you, I am
not that guy anymore.

25:40.039 --> 25:42.588
Yeah, right before you tried
to ruin my client's life

25:42.708 --> 25:44.381
with some bullshit
sexual harassment charge.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.679
Right after he padlocked
my client's livelihood.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.422
Yeah, you're damn right he did.
Harvey.

25:48.505 --> 25:50.428
Because if you're on
a case against me,

25:50.507 --> 25:53.135
it's just a matter of time until you
eviscerate someone I care about.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.721
Eviscerate? If I was going to
eviscerate someone you cared about,

25:55.804 --> 25:58.227
all I'd have to do is point out how
Donna's no longer working for you.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.059
MIKE: Get out of here, Tanner.
She's working for Louis Litt.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.143
You need to get out of
here right now, Tanner.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.227
What did you just say to me?
Then I'd go up

26:02.311 --> 26:03.403
to her and say,
"What happened, Red?

26:03.479 --> 26:04.605
"Did Harvey get
tired of banging you?"

26:04.688 --> 26:05.905
Okay. Harvey.
"Or was he such a lousy lay

26:05.981 --> 26:07.198
"that you left him for
the guy down the road,

26:07.274 --> 26:09.572
"just like Harvey's mom
did to dear old Dad?"

26:09.651 --> 26:11.449
Harvey! Harvey, stop!

26:12.154 --> 26:14.031
Tanner. Get out of here. Now.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.703
Go!

26:26.251 --> 26:27.423
You're absolutely
convinced

26:27.503 --> 26:29.221
Tanner couldn't be
telling the truth.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.422
What does it matter?

26:30.506 --> 26:32.383
Well, you could be
ruining this woman's life.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.760
That's not my problem.

26:34.051 --> 26:35.724
So, you don't believe
in second chances?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.221
I didn't say that.
No.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.643
You just said a man
you didn't trust

26:38.722 --> 26:39.848
swore
he'd changed.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.733
And instead of giving him
a chance to prove that,

26:41.809 --> 26:43.152
you launched
an all-out war.

26:43.227 --> 26:44.820
Were you listening
to my goddamn story?

26:44.895 --> 26:46.112
Did you hear
what he said?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.111
That is not a man
that's changed.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.942
No, I'm talking
about what you did.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.572
You launched
an all-out war.

26:51.652 --> 26:52.904
I did that
for my client.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.123
And for your information, I have given
plenty of people second chances.

26:56.198 --> 26:58.326
Like who?
Louis, for one.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.751
Mike.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.667
Donna. Scottie.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.798
My brother. My...

27:05.916 --> 27:07.133
Your what?

27:09.211 --> 27:11.213
I thought we were
talking about the case.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.056
We started by talking
about your dream.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.805
Yeah, the one I had
because of my case.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.557
Mmm-hmm. And you said the woman
in that dream wasn't Donna.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.518
But it doesn't add up,
because the man was Tanner

27:20.597 --> 27:22.144
and you just told me
what he said about her

27:22.224 --> 27:23.897
the same day that
you had that dream.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.193
Yeah, well, I don't care
if it doesn't add up,

27:25.269 --> 27:26.486
because I'm
telling the truth.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.987
And yet, you have tells all
over you that say otherwise.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.909
Then, you don't know what a tell
is, because I don't have any.

27:33.485 --> 27:34.702
All right.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.702
We'll see who
knows what a tell is.

27:38.574 --> 27:39.700
You want to play
poker with me?

27:39.783 --> 27:41.785
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.962
I'm going to play
poker with you.

27:44.413 --> 27:47.257
And when I win and
you're out of money,

27:47.416 --> 27:48.884
you're going to
tell me the truth.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.261
And what do I get when
you're out of money?

27:51.378 --> 27:52.504
(CHUCKLES)
Doesn't matter,

27:52.588 --> 27:54.215
because it's never
going to happen.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.024
Hey.
Hey.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.146
I need to talk to you
about something.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.269
What's going on? I just got
a call from Travis Tanner.

28:07.436 --> 28:08.813
He wants me to meet
him in half an hour.

28:09.104 --> 28:10.947
VVell, you have to tell Harvey.
I left him two messages.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.696
He hasn't gotten back to me.
But even if he does,

28:12.774 --> 28:13.991
he's going to
tell me not to go.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.486
Well, then, don't go.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.620
You can't go behind
Harvey's back.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.323
That's the thing. What
if going to see Tanner

28:19.406 --> 28:21.124
is more like having
Harvey's back?

28:21.408 --> 28:22.375
What are you
talking about?

28:22.451 --> 28:25.000
The client on the other side
of our case made a fake ID

28:25.078 --> 28:28.082
ten years ago and now Harvey's ready
to send her to prison for it.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.963
And he's only doing it
because of Tanner.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.294
Okay, but it's
still Harvey's call.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.512
And if he makes that call in
his current state of mind,

28:33.587 --> 28:35.464
he might regret it
for the rest of his life.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.929
What do you mean his
current state of mind?

28:41.803 --> 28:44.101
(WHISPERS) A couple of weeks ago,
I walked into Harvey's office

28:44.181 --> 28:46.104
and he was having
a panic attack.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.478
Oh, my God.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.066
And on top of that,
yesterday,

28:50.145 --> 28:51.362
the two of them
got into a yelling match

28:51.438 --> 28:53.657
that ended with Harvey
punching Tanner.

28:55.943 --> 28:58.162
Okay, look.
(SIGHS)

28:58.320 --> 28:59.822
Do whatever
you have to do.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.661
Have Harvey's back.

29:04.701 --> 29:05.873
Where is he?

29:06.995 --> 29:08.963
I don't know.
Bullshit, you don't know.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.671
Jessica, I swear I haven't
seen him since last night.

29:11.792 --> 29:13.009
Then I need to know.

29:13.335 --> 29:14.632
Did he lie to me?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.346
Uh...
Donna.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.674
I have always trusted you.

29:18.924 --> 29:20.597
Now, I need you to trust me.

29:21.343 --> 29:24.938
Did he do some underhanded shit
to fool Jack and it backfired?

29:26.682 --> 29:27.854
Yes.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.644
That's exactly
what he did.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.358
Then, find him.

29:33.063 --> 29:34.690
And tell him
to come see me.

29:43.657 --> 29:45.625
HARVEY: What can I say?
Kings full of sixes.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.369
(SCOFFS)

29:50.664 --> 29:52.382
All right, Harvey.
You won.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.627
What do you want?

29:55.002 --> 29:56.720
Can't I take a minute
to enjoy my win?

29:56.837 --> 29:58.009
You can,

29:58.213 --> 30:00.762
but once our time's up,
I'm done granting wishes.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.642
Well, in that case,
I want you to tell me

30:02.718 --> 30:04.720
the worst mistake you
ever made as a therapist.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.182
That wasn't
part of the deal.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.312
No, no, no, no, no.

30:09.391 --> 30:12.361
You didn't make a deal with me because you
were so sure you were going to beat me.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.939
Well, you didn't, and it's
time to pay the piper.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.782
Well, I'm not
going to do it.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.535
Look who's deflecting now.

30:20.736 --> 30:22.033
Look, I get it, okay?

30:22.112 --> 30:24.240
You're here because your fears
are affecting your work.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.327
And now, you're trying to find a
time where I failed at my job

30:27.409 --> 30:29.582
so that you can
lash out at me.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.163
And I'm not going
to let you do it.

30:31.246 --> 30:34.420
No, I just want you to know what it
feels like to be me in here with you.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.628
And if you're not willing to do that,
then what the hell good are you?

30:43.550 --> 30:44.802
I killed someone.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.185
What?

30:47.304 --> 30:49.352
I do a lot of work as
an expert witness

30:49.431 --> 30:51.854
in corporate
competency situations.

30:52.142 --> 30:53.644
You mean substance abuse. Yes.

30:53.935 --> 30:57.280
And usually, it's high powered
people looking to keep their jobs.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.532
But this time,
it was different.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.445
A client needed
someone to

31:03.945 --> 31:05.538
get his son
out of rehab

31:05.614 --> 31:07.616
so that he could attend
his mother's funeral.

31:07.866 --> 31:11.120
I knew it was a mistake to even get
involved because he wanted it so badly.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.163
But he was
a long-time client

31:13.914 --> 31:16.258
and I cared about
him, so I did it.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.047
I evaluated his son.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.928
And I knew,

31:20.712 --> 31:22.885
I knew deep down
inside he wasn't ready,

31:22.964 --> 31:24.762
but I gave
the go ahead anwvay.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.435
And the night
of the funeral,

31:28.595 --> 31:30.393
he overdosed and died.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.850
I'm so sorry.
Mmm.

31:34.267 --> 31:36.986
Well, I don't want
you to be sorry.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.442
I want you to sit
your ass down and

31:38.522 --> 31:39.865
tell me the truth
about the dream.

31:40.107 --> 31:42.405
I told you before,
I'm telling you the truth.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.781
I don't know who
this woman was.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.488
You know what? I just
opened myself up to you

31:46.655 --> 31:48.532
to show you that I know
what it's like to be you.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.662
But I don't.

31:49.866 --> 31:52.085
Because I know that the
only way to come to terms

31:52.160 --> 31:54.254
with what's inside
is to let it out.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.172
And until you
figure that out,

31:57.332 --> 31:58.299
you might as well
get the hell out.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.252
Because you're wasting
both of our time.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.280
I remember when you
used to ride a bike.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.331
And I remember when you
used to be a scumbag,

32:30.407 --> 32:32.080
but you didn't
pretend you weren't.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.170
Why am I here, Tanner?

32:36.246 --> 32:38.089
I want you to reconsider
our settlement offer.

32:38.165 --> 32:39.963
And what makes you think we're
going to accept the same deal

32:40.041 --> 32:41.258
that you brought
us before?

32:41.376 --> 32:42.719
Because I've sat
across from you,

32:42.836 --> 32:44.838
and I know that you care about
more than just the fight.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.343
Well, I'm sorry. But that
fight's going to end

32:46.423 --> 32:47.595
with Alyssa Lang
going to prison.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.142
Yeah, but it
doesn't have to.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.219
And the only reason

32:51.303 --> 32:52.395
it's going to
end that way

32:52.471 --> 32:54.018
is because that deal
is coming from me.

32:54.347 --> 32:56.600
How the hell am I supposed
to believe a word you say'?

32:56.683 --> 32:58.310
What do you want
me to say, huh?

32:58.685 --> 33:00.483
That I got tired of
playing the goon?

33:00.729 --> 33:02.402
Because I did. Yeah.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.482
I woke up one morning

33:03.565 --> 33:05.238
and I said enough
is enough.

33:05.484 --> 33:06.827
And I haven't
taken one case

33:06.902 --> 33:08.245
that I don't
believe in or done

33:08.320 --> 33:10.414
anything that I couldn't
stomach since.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.449
Look, Mike.

33:12.908 --> 33:14.455
I don't have
a leg to stand on.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.252
I don't have
another move.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.208
But you can
convince Harvey

33:18.288 --> 33:21.087
to convince Petroff not
to destroy this girl's life.

33:21.666 --> 33:24.510
You just need to decide if
you're willing to do that, man.

33:25.378 --> 33:27.597
Travis, you keep saying that
Harvey won't take the deal

33:27.672 --> 33:29.265
because your name's on it.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.435
Well, if you really
are a changed man,

33:33.345 --> 33:35.097
maybe it's time
you prove it.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.901
(GLASS CLINKING)

33:47.776 --> 33:49.699
Oh. Hey,
you're not toner.

33:49.903 --> 33:51.200
Donna, please,
leave me alone.

33:52.405 --> 33:53.907
Louis, you can't hide
in here forever.

33:53.990 --> 33:56.539
I have to. Because I made
a promise to Harvey

33:56.660 --> 33:58.628
and not only did I drop
the ball, I shit the bed.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.664
And on top of that,
I lied to Jessica

34:00.747 --> 34:03.921
telling her that I wouldn't be doing
any more underhanded shit with Jack.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.217
Well...

34:06.378 --> 34:08.301
She knows
what you did.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.014
And it's time
to face the music.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.717
Oh, did you
not just hear me?

34:12.007 --> 34:13.806
I defied a direct order.
I admit that,

34:13.885 --> 34:15.558
I might as well tell her that
I put Harvey's salary

34:15.637 --> 34:17.389
in the copy machine
in the first place.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.561
You know what?
Maybe you should.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.021
Oh, that's really hilarious.
What, are you crazy?

34:24.103 --> 34:25.196
No, Louis, I'm not.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.525
You keep making bad
decision after bad decision.

34:28.190 --> 34:30.193
And this is a chance
to wipe them all clean.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.402
It's not going to
wipe anything clean.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.112
All it's going to do
is get me fired.

34:33.989 --> 34:34.989
(EXHALES)

34:35.447 --> 34:36.870
Yeah, maybe it will.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.665
But the one thing
I do know is

34:39.744 --> 34:41.838
you've lost
Jessica's trust.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.342
This at least gives you a
chance to get it back.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.014
And it's a hell of a lot
better than cowering in here.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.175
(CLINKS)

35:13.820 --> 35:15.197
What is it, Louis?

35:16.031 --> 35:17.499
I'm here to
tell you the truth.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.285
That you lied when you said
you weren't going to do

35:20.368 --> 35:22.336
anything underhanded
with Jack?

35:24.039 --> 35:27.339
That I was the one that left
Harvey's salary in the copy machine.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.716
On purpose.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.305
(EXHALES)

35:36.718 --> 35:38.311
Why aren't you
saying anything?

35:39.179 --> 35:41.773
Because I haven't decided
what I'm going to do.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.228
But what you're
going to do

35:47.145 --> 35:49.568
is get Jack
goddamn Soloff up here.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.377
You wanted to see me?

36:03.828 --> 36:05.080
Yes, I did.

36:05.455 --> 36:06.957
Louis has brought
something to my attention.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.087
And what is that?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.715
Well, according to subsection
0-35 of the bylaws,

36:10.794 --> 36:13.638
we broke protocol when we changed
the compensation formula.

36:13.713 --> 36:16.466
Bullshit. There is
no subsection C-35.

36:16.633 --> 36:17.759
You're wrong.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.765
Here. Take a look. 
JACK: I don't 
need to look.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.230
And if you're asking me to
sell this to the partners,

36:22.305 --> 36:23.431
you're shit out of luck.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.313
No, you're
shit out of luck.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.023
Because Louis didn't just
come to me with the bylaws.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.483
He admitted
that it was you

36:29.562 --> 36:32.941
who deliberately put Harvey's salary
out there for all the world to see.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.944
Isn't that right, Louis?

36:35.110 --> 36:37.238
lam sorry, Jack.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.994
I had to come clean. It was
the right thing to do.

36:40.073 --> 36:42.121
You lying piece of shit.
JESSICA: Watch it, Jack.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.786
You're talking
to a name partner.

36:44.994 --> 36:46.746
And you're saying
that he's lying.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.124
But as head of the
compensation committee,

36:49.207 --> 36:50.925
you had access
to Harvey's salary.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.877
I didn't leave that document
out and I can prove it.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.804
And how is that?
I know for a fact that...

36:56.506 --> 36:59.430
Oh, let me help you out. The
reason you stopped yourself

36:59.509 --> 37:01.432
is that you were going to
say Louis left it out.

37:01.761 --> 37:04.230
But if you knew that and
still didn't come forward,

37:04.305 --> 37:06.148
then I can fire your
<i>ass</i> for that, too.

37:06.975 --> 37:10.320
But you're not going to do that
because you'd also have to fire him,

37:10.520 --> 37:12.397
and you can't afford
another shake up.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.903
You're right.
I can't.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.992
But I don't care,

37:20.321 --> 37:22.369
because I'd rather
fire you both

37:22.657 --> 37:24.330
than to let you
push me around.

37:25.535 --> 37:27.003
So, it's up to you, Jack.

37:27.162 --> 37:29.540
Stand by
provision C-35

37:30.999 --> 37:32.376
or pack up your shit.

37:37.464 --> 37:38.636
(CHUCKLES)

37:40.633 --> 37:42.385
Forgive me, Jessica.
You're right.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.645
Next time, I'll read the
bylaws more carefully.

37:56.357 --> 37:59.201
You knew this whole thing would play out
this way the second it started, right?

37:59.486 --> 38:01.284
I had a pretty good idea.
(SIGHS)

38:01.988 --> 38:03.160
Jessica.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.584
When am I going to
learn not to defy you?

38:06.826 --> 38:08.328
You're never
going to learn.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.918
But as long as I know
that, we'll be okay.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.040
(CHUCKLES)

38:14.209 --> 38:15.381
I...

38:16.377 --> 38:18.220
Feel like going mudding tonight?
No.

38:18.755 --> 38:19.847
I figured.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.720
You better be here to tell
me Tanner's walking away.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.562
I'm here to tell you
that I met with him today.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.230
You went to see him
without telling me?

38:31.351 --> 38:32.523
I left you
two messages.

38:32.602 --> 38:35.481
So the hell what? You don't cut
me out of a meeting on my case.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.689
Your case?

38:38.399 --> 38:40.493
Well, Tanner has made a
settlement offer on your case

38:40.568 --> 38:42.161
and I think that
we should take it.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.789
Are you kidding? We have
a boot to his throat.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.283
We don't have to settle.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.000
All we have to do is decide
is how hard to press.

38:48.076 --> 38:49.328
You're not pressing
on his throat,

38:49.410 --> 38:50.536
you're pressing
on Alyssa Lang's.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.793
So, all he has to do is claim
that he's a changed man

38:52.872 --> 38:54.294
and you take his
side over mine?

38:54.415 --> 38:55.917
I'm not
on his side.

38:56.501 --> 39:00.005
Our client stands to make a fortune from
this deal without lifting a finger.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.432
I don't give a shit. You saw what
he did and you heard what he said.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.759
And you said when
we started this,

39:03.842 --> 39:05.014
it would be just
like old times.

39:05.093 --> 39:07.972
But right now, you're acting
like the bad guy, not him.

39:08.054 --> 39:10.978
That piece of shit hasn't changed
and I'm not settling with him.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.276
And I'm not
asking you to.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.609
What the hell is that?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.073
It's the original offer.

39:19.566 --> 39:21.819
Only now, the attorney of
record is Katrina Bennett.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.117
I had Tanner remove
himself from the case.

39:25.905 --> 39:27.122
So, now, you're
not settling with him,

39:27.198 --> 39:28.996
you're just doing
what's best for everyone.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.584
Take the deal.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.429
You sure you don't
want to read it first?

39:43.214 --> 39:44.386
I don't have to.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.954
(GASPS SLOWLY)

40:17.999 --> 40:19.000
Rachel, I cannot
talk right now.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.175
I'm going mudding
with Donna.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.387
No, Louis. You're going
mudding with both of us.

40:23.838 --> 40:24.885
Ah.

40:26.174 --> 40:27.346
Oh.

40:28.468 --> 40:29.515
Louis?

40:34.599 --> 40:37.853
I have to say, I'm surprised you
called for another appointment.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.314
What can I say? You telling
me that story got to me.

40:41.648 --> 40:43.195
So, you're ready
to tell the truth.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.532
lam.

40:47.612 --> 40:49.865
The woman in my
dream was Donna.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.540
Well, I'm glad you came
back to talk about it.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.540
And since you've opened up to me,
I'm going to open up to you.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.796
I believe you're
telling the truth.

41:01.668 --> 41:02.715
That's opening up?

41:02.877 --> 41:05.346
No, this is. I believe
you're telling the truth,

41:05.463 --> 41:08.717
but I don't think the woman in
your dream was actually Donna.

41:10.343 --> 41:11.560
I think it was
your mother.

41:12.929 --> 41:14.681
I don't believe it.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.146
(SIGHS)

41:17.225 --> 41:20.775
I tell you the thing that's
been eating at me for days,

41:21.104 --> 41:22.321
and you're
calling me a liar?

41:22.397 --> 41:23.899
No, I'm not
calling you a liar.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.492
Your dream was a representation
of unresolved issues.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.194
The only unresolved
issue is

41:28.277 --> 41:30.245
I opened up and
you're turning on me.

41:30.697 --> 41:32.244
Harvey, bringing up your
mother isn't turning on you.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.417
You have no idea what bringing
up my mother is to me.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.711
No, I don't.
That's the whole point 
of what we're doing here.

41:36.786 --> 41:38.959
It doesn't matter what we're
doing here because we're done.

41:39.122 --> 41:40.465
Harvey. Harvey, look.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.840
I don't care how much money you make
or how many women you sleep with.

41:44.085 --> 41:48.591
You have issues in your life that will
keep you from having real relationships.

41:48.673 --> 41:49.925
And you can
tell yourself

41:50.008 --> 41:52.557
all you want that it has nothing
to do with your mother.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.433
But it's a lie,
and you know it.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.389
Hmm. Well, like I said,

41:56.472 --> 41:57.815
we're done.
