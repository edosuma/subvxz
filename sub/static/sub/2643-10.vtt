00:12.560 --> 00:14.570
Clarify something for me.

00:14.570 --> 00:15.600
Isn't the point

00:15.600 --> 00:17.670
of a communal meal

00:17.670 --> 00:20.300
the exchange of ideas
and opinions?

00:20.310 --> 00:23.040
An opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

00:23.040 --> 00:24.380
It is.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.240
You just kind of put
a damper on things

00:26.240 --> 00:27.880
when you said,
"The next person I see talking

00:27.880 --> 00:30.450
with food in their mouth
will be put to death."

00:30.450 --> 00:33.720
Well, we could argue about
who said what all night long,

00:33.720 --> 00:36.520
but to set things back
on course,

00:36.520 --> 00:38.860
I will propose
a new topic of conversation.

00:39.890 --> 00:40.890
Great.

00:40.890 --> 00:42.960
What is the best number?

00:42.960 --> 00:46.760
By the way, there's only
one correct answer.

00:46.770 --> 00:50.570
5,318,008?

00:50.570 --> 00:51.770
Wrong.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.910
The best number is 73.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.210
You're probably wondering why.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.710
No. Uh-uh.
We're good.

01:01.710 --> 01:04.129
73 is the 21st prime number.

01:04.129 --> 01:08.120
Its mirror, 37, is the 12th,
and its mirror, 21,

01:08.120 --> 01:09.820
is the product of multiplying--

01:09.820 --> 01:13.190
hang on to your hats--
seven and three.

01:13.860 --> 01:17.190
Eh? Eh? Did I lie?

01:17.200 --> 01:18.230
We get it.

01:18.230 --> 01:21.100
73 is the Chuck Norris
of numbers.

01:21.100 --> 01:23.800
Chuck Norris wishes.

01:24.220 --> 01:26.220
In binary 73 is a palindrome:

01:26.470 --> 01:29.210
"one-zero-zero-
one-zero-zero-one"

01:29.210 --> 01:32.680
which backwards is "one-zero-
zero-one-zero-zero-one"--

01:32.680 --> 01:34.050
exactly the same.

01:34.050 --> 01:38.450
All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is: "Sirron Kcuhc."

01:38.450 --> 01:40.480
Just for the record,

01:40.490 --> 01:44.040
when you enter 5,318,008
on a calculator,

01:44.040 --> 01:46.960
upside-down it spells "boobies""

01:50.000 --> 01:51.330
Remember when you were wondering

01:51.330 --> 01:53.500
why the girls didn't
want to eat with us tonight?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.500
Yeah, I get it now.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.140
I love your little
heart locket, Bernadette.

01:59.140 --> 02:00.470
Oh, thanks.

02:00.470 --> 02:01.770
Howard gave it to me.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.110
It's the cutest thing.

02:03.110 --> 02:04.840
Every time I have
dinner with his mom,

02:04.840 --> 02:06.810
the next day I get jewelry.

02:08.009 --> 02:09.880
Did you know that the iconic
Valentine's heart shape

02:09.880 --> 02:12.280
is not actually based
on the shape of a human heart,

02:12.280 --> 02:13.920
but rather on the shape
of the buttocks

02:13.920 --> 02:15.650
of a female bending over?

02:17.660 --> 02:20.420
Oh, so I spent seventh grade

02:20.430 --> 02:22.990
dotting my I's
with little asses?

02:23.730 --> 02:25.160
Cool.

02:25.160 --> 02:28.230
Hey, Penny, how's it going?

02:28.230 --> 02:30.130
Hey, Zack,
what are you doing here?

02:30.140 --> 02:32.170
My dad's company prints
the menus for this place.

02:32.170 --> 02:33.770
I'm just dropping off
some new ones laminated.

02:33.770 --> 02:36.510
Makes 'em easier to clean
if people throw up on 'em.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.010
Guess how I got the idea?

02:39.010 --> 02:40.680
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

02:40.680 --> 02:44.150
Uh, Zack, these are
my friends Bernadette and Amy.

02:44.150 --> 02:45.550
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:45.550 --> 02:46.930
Hoo.

02:48.890 --> 02:51.560
Okay, well, it was
good to see you.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.490
Yeah, you, too.

02:53.490 --> 02:55.330
He's really cute.
How do you know him?

02:55.330 --> 02:56.940
Oh, we went out
a couple of times.

02:56.950 --> 02:59.030
I'm often flummoxed
by current slang.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.770
Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

03:01.770 --> 03:03.950
Yes.
No, no.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.470
But in this case, yes.

03:06.470 --> 03:07.970
Interesting.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.270
And was it not satisfactory?

03:09.270 --> 03:10.810
No, it was great.

03:10.810 --> 03:13.680
He just didn't really challenge
me on an intellectual level.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.350
Couldn't you just fool around
with him and then listen to NPR?

03:17.350 --> 03:21.820
Wouldn't help. Zack
can't even spell NPR.

03:21.820 --> 03:23.920
It's what I do with Howard.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.620
I'm much smarter than he is.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.230
But it's important
to protect his manhood.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.100
Hoo.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.630
What's the matter?

03:34.630 --> 03:36.320
I'm suddenly feeling flushed.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.540
My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy,

03:39.540 --> 03:40.770
my mouth is dry.

03:40.770 --> 03:44.240
In addition, I keep
involuntarily saying "hoo."

03:44.240 --> 03:47.950
Oh, we know what's
causing that, don't we?

03:47.950 --> 03:49.610
It's no mystery.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.120
I obviously have the flu

03:51.120 --> 03:53.580
coupled with sudden-onset
Tourette's syndrome.

04:21.769 --> 04:23.870
Did you hear about the
accident at the bio lab?

04:23.970 --> 04:24.880
No.
What happened?

04:24.970 --> 04:27.770
They were injecting rats
with radioactive isotopes

04:27.770 --> 04:29.710
and one of the techs got bit.

04:29.710 --> 04:32.210
Did he get superpowers?

04:33.750 --> 04:37.750
No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.550
Oh. Well, that's disappointing.

04:40.550 --> 04:42.120
Why?

04:42.120 --> 04:44.190
Well, you get bit by a
radioactive animal in a lab,

04:44.190 --> 04:46.820
you kind of want to turn
into a superhero.

04:46.830 --> 04:50.030
Yeah, but who'd want
to become Rat-Man?

04:50.030 --> 04:52.330
Who wouldn't?

04:52.330 --> 04:55.870
You could zip through
a maze in nothing flat,

04:55.870 --> 04:57.700
squeeze through
really small holes,

04:57.700 --> 05:00.740
and shut down restaurants
in a single bound.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.810
And the best part is,
if I were Rat-Man,

05:02.810 --> 05:05.080
you could be my
sidekick, Mouse Boy.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.780
Mouse Boy?

05:11.780 --> 05:13.220
You don't like "Mouse Boy"?

05:13.220 --> 05:15.320
How about "Kid Vermin"?

05:15.320 --> 05:17.290
First of all,
if we had superpowers,

05:17.290 --> 05:19.960
I wouldn't be the sidekick.
You'd be the sidekick.

05:19.960 --> 05:22.790
Rat-Man is nobody's sidekick.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.450
Leonard, settle this.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.700
Of the two of us, who's
the obvious sidekick?

05:26.700 --> 05:28.100
Yeah, Leonard, who?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.640
12 years after high school,
and I'm still at the nerd table.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.510
Aren't you slicing that
man's brain a little too thin?

05:47.690 --> 05:49.390
It's too thin if I were making

05:49.390 --> 05:51.550
a foot-long brain sandwich
at Quiznos.

05:51.560 --> 05:56.330
For examination under a two-
photon microscope, it's fine.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.170
Well, you're the expert.

06:02.170 --> 06:06.170
If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

06:06.170 --> 06:07.370
Very well.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.620
If you die and donate
your body to science,

06:09.620 --> 06:11.670
I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.640
Thank you.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.240
Now, if you'll
excuse me,

06:15.250 --> 06:18.060
I have to take my temperature.

06:18.070 --> 06:20.580
Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms

06:20.580 --> 06:23.790
in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

06:23.790 --> 06:25.620
I did that one summer.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.420
Ah, youth.

06:27.420 --> 06:31.290
No, I experienced some
distressing symptoms last night,

06:31.300 --> 06:33.200
so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.230
I'd be happy to create a chart

06:35.230 --> 06:37.930
and participate in a
differential diagnosis.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.000
Oh, that sounds like fun.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.510
All right.

06:44.510 --> 06:46.110
What were the symptoms?

06:46.110 --> 06:50.010
Elevated heart rate,
moist palms, dry mouth

06:50.010 --> 06:52.980
and localized
vascular throbbing.

06:52.980 --> 06:57.650
Localized to what region?

06:57.650 --> 07:01.320
Ears and genitalia.

07:01.330 --> 07:03.560
Interesting.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.260
Not body parts
that usually team up.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.030
What about
environmental factors?

07:11.030 --> 07:12.940
Describe the scene for me.

07:12.940 --> 07:15.200
I was sitting in a restaurant
with Penny and Bernadette,

07:15.210 --> 07:18.070
drinking water-- carbonated
as it was a special occasion.

07:18.080 --> 07:23.710
Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

07:23.710 --> 07:24.910
Who?

07:24.920 --> 07:26.220
Zack.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.450
Then why did you ask?

07:28.450 --> 07:30.590
Ask what?
Who.

07:30.590 --> 07:32.390
Zack.

07:32.390 --> 07:35.490
All right, let's start over.

07:35.490 --> 07:37.590
What did you say
when Zack walked in?

07:37.590 --> 07:40.230
"Hoo."
Zack.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.000
Why do you keep saying "Zack"?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.670
Because you keep saying "who."

07:43.670 --> 07:45.200
I'm not saying "hoo" now.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.340
I said "hoo" last night.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.670
And the answer was Zack,
correct?

07:48.670 --> 07:50.470
There was no question.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.280
I simply said "hoo."

07:54.450 --> 07:56.580
All right, I think
I have enough to go on.

07:56.580 --> 08:00.650
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are,

08:00.650 --> 08:02.950
in descending order
of likelihood:

08:02.950 --> 08:05.590
hyperthyroidism,
premature menopause,

08:05.590 --> 08:08.890
hosting an alien parasite or--

08:08.890 --> 08:11.230
and I only include it
for the sake of covering

08:11.230 --> 08:15.100
absolutely all bases--
sexual arousal.

08:17.470 --> 08:19.430
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.340
There you are.

08:25.370 --> 08:25.860
Oh, hey.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.860
Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

08:28.860 --> 08:30.470
I don't know. Um...

08:30.470 --> 08:31.670
Nuclear war.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.200
Accidentally being
buried alive.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.200
Any of those movies where
you get that phone call

08:35.200 --> 08:36.500
that says you're
going to die.

08:36.510 --> 08:38.570
And then you do.

08:38.570 --> 08:40.409
No. Something very specific

08:40.409 --> 08:41.640
that we both know you,

08:41.640 --> 08:44.480
Rajesh Koothrappali,
are terrified of.

08:44.480 --> 08:47.320
Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

08:47.320 --> 08:48.450
The thought of
losing a toe...

08:48.450 --> 08:50.440
Spiders!
You're afraid of spiders!

08:50.440 --> 08:52.950
What the heck is this?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.390
A jar with a big spider
in it, of course.

08:55.390 --> 08:57.390
Bravery test.

08:57.390 --> 09:01.430
First one to take his hand out
is the sidekick.

09:02.230 --> 09:04.100
Are you crazy?

09:04.100 --> 09:05.970
Perhaps.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.370
Are you scared?

09:08.370 --> 09:10.640
No. But it's a stupid test.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.570
Oh, really?
What if the earth was in danger

09:13.580 --> 09:14.730
and the only way to save it was

09:14.730 --> 09:17.650
to stick your hand
in a jar with a spider?

09:17.650 --> 09:19.180
Oh, yeah?
What if the earth was in danger

09:19.180 --> 09:20.750
and the only way
to save it was to take a shower

09:20.750 --> 09:23.380
in the locker room and let
other guys see you naked?

09:25.250 --> 09:27.720
Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.360
Put your hand
in the jar

09:30.360 --> 09:32.830
or forever be revealed
as my sidekick.

09:32.830 --> 09:35.650
All right, I will.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.870
How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

09:39.870 --> 09:41.040
It's easy.

09:41.040 --> 09:42.440
The spider's crawling
up your arm.

09:48.590 --> 09:50.110
Get it off! Get it off!

09:50.110 --> 09:52.380
Please, Raj!

09:54.120 --> 09:55.950
Please.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.390
Oh!

10:00.520 --> 10:03.160
My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

10:03.160 --> 10:04.560
Cortisol levels normal.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.130
How about your

10:06.130 --> 10:08.300
follicle-stimulating hormone
levels?

10:08.300 --> 10:11.070
Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

10:11.070 --> 10:12.700
Are you sure?

10:12.700 --> 10:16.600
You said that with
the testy bark of an old biddy.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.870
I think we need
to face the cold, hard truth:

10:19.880 --> 10:23.640
I was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

10:23.650 --> 10:25.310
Hang on. I don't know

10:25.310 --> 10:27.520
that we've given
the alien parasite hypothesis

10:27.520 --> 10:29.620
a fair shake.

10:29.620 --> 10:30.690
Let's look at this logically.

10:30.690 --> 10:32.620
I have a stomach; I get hungry.

10:32.620 --> 10:35.720
I have genitals; I have the
potential for sexual arousal.

10:35.720 --> 10:38.690
A cross we all must bear.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.800
You know, in difficult
moments like this,

10:43.800 --> 10:46.800
I often turn to a force
greater than myself.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.800
Religion?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.000
Star Trek.

10:50.010 --> 10:52.410
Did you see
<i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture?</i>

10:52.410 --> 10:54.440
No.
Don't. It's terrible. However...

10:54.440 --> 10:56.940
in it, we learn that

10:56.950 --> 10:59.980
when Spock finds himself
drawn off the path of logic

10:59.980 --> 11:03.850
by feelings bubbling up from his
human half, he suppresses them

11:03.850 --> 11:06.620
using the Vulcan mental
discipline of Kolinar.

11:06.620 --> 11:08.720
Are you suggesting
we live our lives

11:08.720 --> 11:11.330
guided by the philosophies
found in cheap science fiction?

11:11.330 --> 11:13.460
"Cheap science fiction"?

11:17.800 --> 11:19.730
What are you doing?

11:19.740 --> 11:26.210
Using Kolinar to suppress
my anger at that last comment.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.780
Is it possible that your
concern for me at this moment

11:28.780 --> 11:31.380
is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

11:32.780 --> 11:34.320
I hadn't considered that.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.220
Give me a moment.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.620
All right, I've considered it.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.420
And?
I reject it.

11:43.430 --> 11:46.360
You reject it because
you don't feel jealousy,

11:46.360 --> 11:48.500
or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

11:49.970 --> 11:52.500
I think
I'll eat my lunch at home.

11:54.370 --> 11:55.870
That's not your
lunch, Sheldon;

11:55.870 --> 11:59.270
those are the cadaver
brain specimens.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.640
Oh.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.390
As they were incorrectly sliced,

12:03.400 --> 12:06.610
you can see how I could
mistake them for my sashimi.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.100
Hello.

12:16.170 --> 12:19.390
Hey. Isn't tomorrow
your usual laundry night?

12:19.390 --> 12:22.560
The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

12:22.560 --> 12:25.310
If this one under-
or over-softens,

12:25.320 --> 12:28.100
I'll need time
to make things right.

12:28.100 --> 12:29.800
That's thinking ahead.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.160
The alternative would be
to think backwards.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.770
That's just remembering.

12:36.740 --> 12:37.780
So how's Amy?

12:37.780 --> 12:40.150
Amy's changed.

12:40.150 --> 12:42.620
I might have to let her go.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.220
Oh, no. Why?

12:44.220 --> 12:46.950
I thought she was
a highly evolved creature

12:46.950 --> 12:49.060
of pure intellect, like me.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.870
But recent events indicate that

12:50.870 --> 12:53.340
she may be a slave
to her baser urges.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.360
Like you.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.230
Just going to
skip over that insult.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.680
What insult?

13:01.690 --> 13:04.770
Yeah. That's why
I'm going to skip over it.

13:04.770 --> 13:06.640
Are you saying that Amy is...

13:06.640 --> 13:09.640
oh, what's the
scientific word...

13:09.640 --> 13:12.410
Forget science. She's horny.

13:14.110 --> 13:16.400
Oh! Okay. Wow.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.750
It's simple biology. There's
nothing I can do about it.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.090
Are you sure?

13:27.160 --> 13:28.590
What are you suggesting?

13:28.600 --> 13:32.230
I'm suggesting there
might be something

13:32.230 --> 13:35.670
you could do about...
Amy's urges?

13:39.270 --> 13:42.410
It's illegal to spay
a human being.

13:44.980 --> 13:47.210
Yeah. That's not
what I had in mind.

13:47.210 --> 13:48.680
Oh.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.280
Oh!

13:51.280 --> 13:53.950
You mean...
something <i>I</i> could do.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.020
Exactly.

13:55.020 --> 13:59.860
Well, I was hoping
to avoid this.

13:59.860 --> 14:02.860
But I might as well
get it over with.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.060
Thank you, Penny.

14:05.060 --> 14:07.300
I'll let you
know what happens.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.870
Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.480
Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.050
Is this the Zack Johnson

14:20.050 --> 14:22.920
who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny?

14:24.720 --> 14:26.920
Sorry to bother you.

14:32.660 --> 14:35.860
Hello. I'm looking
for a Zack Johnson

14:35.860 --> 14:39.400
who used to have coitus
with my neighbor Penny.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.500
Coitus. It means intercourse.

14:41.500 --> 14:45.170
And I have a feeling I'm
speaking to the right Zack.

14:45.170 --> 14:47.410
This is Sheldon Cooper.

14:47.410 --> 14:49.280
Fine. Shelly.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.810
Yes, that does
sound like a girl's name.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.780
No, it doesn't bother me.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.720
Yes, "Smelly Shelly"
does bother me.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.120
Let me tell you why I'm calling.

14:59.120 --> 15:01.120
I'd like to know
if you'd be interested

15:01.120 --> 15:04.760
in having sex
with Amy Farrah Fowler.

15:04.760 --> 15:07.160
Amy Farrah Fowler.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.560
Yes, that <i>is</i>  a girl's name.

15:09.560 --> 15:13.350
Good grief. It's like trying
to talk to a dolphin.

15:14.570 --> 15:16.500
Really?

15:16.500 --> 15:19.770
This is going to decide who's
the hero and who's the sidekick?

15:28.920 --> 15:30.020
You got a better idea?

15:30.020 --> 15:34.450
Every idea is better
than this idea.

15:34.450 --> 15:35.650
Ding!

15:35.660 --> 15:38.490
Wait. What the hell is "ding"?
It's a bell.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.090
I don't think this
kind of wrestling has a bell.

15:40.090 --> 15:41.930
Fine. How do you
want to start?

15:41.930 --> 15:44.060
I say, uh, how about
one, two, three, go?

15:44.060 --> 15:46.700
One-two-three-go?
That's for babies.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.730
Okay, how about, uh...

15:48.740 --> 15:50.170
On your mark, get set, go?

15:50.170 --> 15:51.520
That's for a footrace.
If you want to race,

15:51.520 --> 15:52.840
we have to go outside.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.640
No, it's chilly outside.
Didn't bring my jacket.

15:57.110 --> 15:58.360
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.680
What kind of superhero
needs a jacket?

16:00.680 --> 16:03.070
What kind of superhero says,
"Dibs on the red tights!

16:03.070 --> 16:04.780
Dibs on the red tights!"

16:04.780 --> 16:07.750
All right, how about this?
Ready, wrestle.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.360
Wait. Are we starting now? Or
is that what you're going to say

16:10.360 --> 16:11.660
when we do start, or...
We're starting now!

16:11.660 --> 16:13.830
Don't yell at me!

16:21.070 --> 16:24.300
Suppose there are worse ways
to spend a Friday night.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.340
None come to mind.

16:31.910 --> 16:35.950
Look at this stamp.
On what authority

16:35.950 --> 16:39.350
are they permitted to
mutilate patrons as they enter?

16:39.350 --> 16:41.400
I'm sure it'll wash off.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.020
Little comfort tonight.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.090
I look like a Hell's Angel.

16:46.460 --> 16:48.560
There's Zack.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.230
Are you sure this is
what you want to do?

16:51.230 --> 16:53.130
It's not what I want to do;

16:53.130 --> 16:56.000
it's what I have to do.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.100
Go, Amy Farrah Fowler.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.270
Follow your endocrine system.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.940
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.410
Please don't drag this out.

17:09.849 --> 17:12.920
This is never going to come off.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.390
Excuse me?

17:15.390 --> 17:18.190
Zack, I am Amy Farrah Fowler.
We met the other night.

17:18.190 --> 17:21.430
I have spent my life in
pursuit of pure knowledge.

17:21.430 --> 17:23.160
Until I met you,
my decisions

17:23.160 --> 17:25.060
were founded in
logic and reason.

17:25.069 --> 17:28.530
And yet here I stand before you,
130 pounds of raging estrogen,

17:28.540 --> 17:30.870
longing to grab hold
of your gluteus maximus

17:30.870 --> 17:32.370
and make Shakespeare's
metaphorical

17:32.370 --> 17:35.310
beast with two backs.

17:36.790 --> 17:39.110
My gluteus what?

17:39.110 --> 17:41.450
On the other hand,

17:41.450 --> 17:44.080
as I look at the blank, ape-like
expression on your face,

17:44.080 --> 17:47.020
I have decided to adopt the
Vulcan practice of Kolinar.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.590
Good-bye, Zack.
Bye.

17:50.590 --> 17:52.810
Hoo.

17:56.260 --> 17:58.500
That should hold me for a while.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.140
I'm legally obligated
to inform you

18:10.140 --> 18:14.500
that I took a karate lesson
when I was 11.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.420
I'd be a regular ninja by now

18:16.420 --> 18:18.170
if my mom could've
arranged a carpool.

18:19.290 --> 18:20.840
Oh, yeah?

18:20.840 --> 18:22.960
Well, I've been taking
Pilates class at the rec center,

18:22.960 --> 18:25.840
and my abs look like
sections of a Hershey bar.

18:25.840 --> 18:27.880
Oh, yeah? Won't matter,
you're going down!

18:27.880 --> 18:29.630
No, uh-uh, you're going down!

18:29.630 --> 18:31.660
If anybody's going to go down,
it's going to be you.

18:31.660 --> 18:36.440
Fellas. It's been 30 minutes.
Nobody's touched each other.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.640
I'm glad you decided to reject
your animal hindbrain

18:41.640 --> 18:44.280
and return to the
realm of pure intellect.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.450
As am I.

18:48.650 --> 18:50.200
What are you doing?

18:50.200 --> 18:52.370
An experiment.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.920
Nope. Nothing.
Never mind.

19:08.340 --> 19:09.720
You realize you can't win.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.530
I prefer to think
that I can't lose.

19:16.370 --> 19:17.430
You're wrong.

19:17.430 --> 19:18.670
It's only a matter of time

19:18.670 --> 19:22.600
before you fall into
Rat-Man's rat trap.

19:22.610 --> 19:24.070
You pathetic fool!

19:24.070 --> 19:27.040
If there were a rat-catcher,
wouldn't it catch Rat-Man?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.440
Just because I didn't
express myself well

19:29.450 --> 19:31.830
doesn't mean my
underlying point was invalid!

19:31.830 --> 19:33.630
You bloviating buffoon!

19:33.630 --> 19:36.120
You narcissistic nincompoop!

19:36.120 --> 19:37.790
You crimson coward!

19:37.790 --> 19:39.190
Oh, Leonard, wake up,

19:39.190 --> 19:40.970
you're missing some very
excellent superhero quips.
