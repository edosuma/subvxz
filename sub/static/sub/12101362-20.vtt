WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:02.002
Previously on Dynasty...

00:02.043 --> 00:04.004
Jeff, this is Brady.
My ex-husband.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.755
There's a spy watching
everything I do.

00:05.797 --> 00:08.466
And I know who's tipping
him off... Brady Lloyd.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.343
JEFF: I spoke to the heads
of the teacher's union.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.429
I promised them that one of
your first acts as senator

00:12.470 --> 00:14.973
would be to push through
a federal tax on oil companies

00:15.015 --> 00:17.225
that directly funds education.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.601
Some of my biggest donors are
oil companies.

00:18.643 --> 00:20.061
I never would've agreed to that.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.229
I've landed a gig somewhere

00:21.271 --> 00:22.605
I really belong,
the hospital.

00:22.647 --> 00:23.898
You should probably
watch your back.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.191
Ezra Feldman called.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.609
He's an A-list divorce attorney

00:26.651 --> 00:28.153
here in Atlanta--
why did he call?

00:28.194 --> 00:29.070
He was asking
if you had a lawyer

00:29.112 --> 00:30.280
that he could reach out to?

00:30.321 --> 00:31.740
Oh, my God.

00:31.781 --> 00:34.284
Wish I could do something
to make it better.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.790
(panting)

00:45.336 --> 00:47.380
I always knew
there was something here,

00:47.422 --> 00:49.966
but... wow.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.011
Unless I'm totally misreading
how great that was?

00:53.053 --> 00:55.472
No, it was fantastic, really.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.182
You should be thrilled
with yourself.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.434
Call me old-fashioned,
but I'm generally not thrilled

00:59.476 --> 01:01.019
unless my partner is, too.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.395
And that's not
the word I'd use

01:02.437 --> 01:04.147
to describe you at the moment.
Well...

01:04.189 --> 01:06.066
I have no idea where
my husband is,

01:06.107 --> 01:08.860
the most aggressive
divorce attorney in Atlanta

01:08.902 --> 01:10.862
left me a message,
and instead of

01:10.904 --> 01:13.364
going to find him
and beg for a second chance,

01:13.406 --> 01:15.784
I decided to sleep
with my archnemesis

01:15.825 --> 01:17.952
turned business partner, so...

01:17.994 --> 01:20.538
yeah, no, I'm not thrilled.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.707
In your defense, he was the one
who asked for time away.

01:22.749 --> 01:24.834
I don't think I can Ross and
Rachel my way out of this one.

01:24.876 --> 01:26.669
Look.

01:26.711 --> 01:28.379
Colin?

01:28.421 --> 01:29.839
You can skip the whole

01:29.881 --> 01:31.883
"it's not you, it's me" speech.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.676
This was an itch
we've been longing to scratch

01:33.718 --> 01:35.053
since Wharton.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.055
We're not soul mates.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
This was still a mistake, so...

01:39.140 --> 01:41.101
now I need to go find Liam,

01:41.142 --> 01:43.436
confess my sins,
and beg for absolution.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.522
If you're trying
to save your marriage,

01:45.563 --> 01:48.316
I'm not sure confession is
the best way to go.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.692
I'm not sure I asked
for your opinion.

01:49.734 --> 01:52.320
Earlier this year,
I had a... indiscretion

01:52.362 --> 01:54.155
with my assistant.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.907
Your assistant, really?
How clichÃ©.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.158
I don't recall asking
for your opinion.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.827
The point is...

01:58.868 --> 02:00.745
I thought coming clean
would give my wife and I

02:00.787 --> 02:02.455
the fresh start we needed.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.958
Instead, I got
a costly divorce settlement

02:04.999 --> 02:06.543
and I had to hire
a new assistant.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.836
Rough day.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.420
I should've kept
my mouth shut and just

02:09.462 --> 02:10.797
whisked my wife away
for a romantic weekend.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.590
Telling Liam

02:12.632 --> 02:14.175
might make you feel better,

02:14.217 --> 02:15.593
but it'll make him feel worse.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.470
Okay. Bye.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.311
Oh, Fallon, I, um,

02:25.353 --> 02:27.438
I-I forgot
my charger.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.482
And then I saw an email that
I hadn't answered yet and...

02:29.524 --> 02:30.859
This is not what it looks like.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.236
I didn't see anything
and even if I did,

02:33.278 --> 02:35.280
discretion is a part of my job.

02:35.321 --> 02:37.490
Thank you. Since you're here,

02:37.532 --> 02:40.201
would you mind locking up
after he's done...

02:40.243 --> 02:41.286
Of course.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.496
Okay, thank you.

02:43.538 --> 02:46.249
I have to go take care
of something now.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.253
Update?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.338
The new VIP fleet is
almost ready.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.257
We should be up in the air
in less than a month.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.050
Make it three weeks.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.886
DiFienza is gaining
on us and his jets...

02:57.927 --> 02:59.429
come with a sushi chef.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.222
I'm not worried
about a little spicy tuna roll

03:01.264 --> 03:02.307
when we're about
to build the only

03:02.348 --> 03:03.683
private airfield
in Metro Atlanta.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.602
Let me get this open
for you.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.812
I'm glad he's confident.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.814
If I don't win this election,
we're not gonna get

03:09.856 --> 03:12.192
within ten miles
of that land.
The numbers this morning

03:12.233 --> 03:14.319
looked like they were
trending up. Smile.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.321
That's good news.

03:16.362 --> 03:18.031
With Beto trying to sabotage me,
I'm worried.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.408
You know, this whole thing may
be slipping through my fingers.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.619
Leave the worrying to me--
I have a PI looking for Beto.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.120
We'll know the moment
he surfaces.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.788
And you got an extra

03:25.830 --> 03:27.457
boost from Adam's
press release this morning.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.459
What, for that
anti-aging drug of his?

03:29.500 --> 03:31.502
It's not exactly
curing cancer, is it?

03:31.544 --> 03:32.921
But I guess people want
to see this family

03:32.962 --> 03:34.923
doing good works.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.508
Which is why you're making an
appearance at a food bank today.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.802
Oh, really?
It's a good way to show

03:39.844 --> 03:41.971
that Blake Carrington might be
a one-percenter,

03:42.013 --> 03:44.224
but he still works hard...
for everyone.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.809
So... maybe don't mention
the private jets.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.019
(indistinct chatter)

03:48.061 --> 03:50.230
(birds chirping)

03:50.271 --> 03:51.731
You know, I really should
get back to my hotel.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.191
You should.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.485
You know, I hate the idea of...

03:55.526 --> 03:57.487
wasting even one more second
with you

03:57.528 --> 03:59.113
when we've already lost
so much time.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.865
I know, in some ways

04:00.907 --> 04:02.867
it's like we've picked up
right where we left off.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.244
But it is still

04:04.285 --> 04:05.870
a little strange.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.997
(knocking)

04:09.165 --> 04:10.625
Jeff?

04:10.667 --> 04:11.918
Are you okay?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.544
No, I'm not okay.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.588
I've been trying
to reach you for days.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.965
We were in a cabin
in the mountains.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.800
There was no signal.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.093
Well, you're back now,
and we need to talk.

04:20.134 --> 04:21.719
Privately.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.305
I'm heading out
anyway.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.557
But I hope we can spend
some time together.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.559
I'd like to get to know
Dominique's son.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.478
Yeah, I bet you would.
Jeff!

04:39.404 --> 04:41.447
That was rude.
Yeah.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.574
Maybe I'd be less rude
if you'd told me

04:43.616 --> 04:46.244
you were still married
to that guy.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.204
I was going to tell you.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.373
Uh, when, on your 15th
wedding anniversary?

04:50.415 --> 04:52.500
Sweetheart, it's complicated.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.837
Brady was the love of my life.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.214
When he disappeared,
I waited a year

04:58.256 --> 05:00.008
for him to come back.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.635
And when he didn't,
I filed for divorce.

05:02.677 --> 05:05.054
So why aren't you divorced?
Because...

05:05.096 --> 05:07.307
it turns out
it's hard to divorce

05:07.348 --> 05:09.183
someone who's missing.

05:09.225 --> 05:10.685
You have to prove
that you've

05:10.727 --> 05:12.979
tried to find them,
run classified ads

05:13.021 --> 05:14.814
and a bunch of other things.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.025
It got lost in the
shuffle, I guess.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.319
Does Brady know he's still
my stepfather?

05:19.360 --> 05:22.572
No. I was waiting for
the right moment to tell him.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.741
Yeah, well,
the right moment is never.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.453
Dom-Mystique just hit
five million in sales on FSN.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.496
Yeah, and your husband
would be entitled

05:30.538 --> 05:32.540
to half in a divorce.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.459
Oh.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.753
So you want me to stay

05:36.794 --> 05:39.505
secretly married forever?
No.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.632
I want you to get secretly
divorced as soon as possible.

05:41.674 --> 05:44.093
If you truly

05:44.135 --> 05:46.429
think this guy's
the love of your life,

05:46.471 --> 05:48.765
get a prenup and remarry him

05:48.806 --> 05:50.683
the day after the divorce
for all I care.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.143
But you'll never
know what he's really

05:52.185 --> 05:54.520
after until you take
money out of the equation.

05:54.562 --> 05:56.773
This is
my divorce attorney.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.733
Call him...
today.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.943
Hmm.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.570
Thanks.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.073
What are you doing here?

06:05.114 --> 06:06.783
Picking up my research files.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.826
From my Alzheimer's trial
you canceled.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.536
We've been through this.
The files are

06:10.578 --> 06:12.580
hospital property, Dr. Larson.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.540
They were hospital property.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.168
But I spoke with a very helpful
woman in the legal department

06:17.210 --> 06:18.836
here who worked out
a deal for me.

06:18.878 --> 06:21.089
I think you may be
related to her.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.385
My long-lost sister is
a real treat, isn't she?

06:25.426 --> 06:26.677
All right, uh,

06:26.719 --> 06:28.429
I'll put in a request to pull

06:28.471 --> 06:30.181
those files from the archive.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.641
It's about a 24-hour turnaround,

06:31.682 --> 06:33.226
so you should...
come back tomorrow.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.477
I'll be here.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.354
Kudos on the big drug trial.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.398
I hope it doesn't hit a snag.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.526
(knocking on door)

06:43.194 --> 06:45.905
Fallon? I guess you found me.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.448
I stayed up all night
calling every hotel

06:47.490 --> 06:48.866
in Atlanta
looking for Liam Ridley.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.410
And when that didn't work,
I called them

06:50.451 --> 06:51.661
all back using
your other name.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.621
Who knew that John Southside

06:53.663 --> 06:56.082
was right here at La Mirage
the whole time?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.042
I figured this was the last
place you'd think to look.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.794
Come in.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.629
It was.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.840
But... I have
to tell you something.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.803
I booked us
a romantic weekend getaway.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.389
I know that you hired
a divorce attorney,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.724
and I just want
to show you

07:13.766 --> 07:15.560
that I'm not gonna give up
without a fight.

07:15.601 --> 07:17.979
I didn't call
a divorce attorney.
What?

07:18.020 --> 07:20.148
But I got a message
from Ezra Feldman

07:20.189 --> 07:22.692
two days after you announced
you wanted a break.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.277
I-I don't know anything
about that.

07:24.318 --> 07:26.362
Fallon, I sa--
I said I wanted a break.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.739
Not a divorce.
Oh.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.950
Well, good.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.244
Because I miss you, Liam.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.954
And I know you
miss me, too.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.331
Or you at least
miss someone

07:37.373 --> 07:39.917
remembering to put your bookmark
in when you fall asleep reading.

07:39.959 --> 07:42.044
I mean, how else you gonna
know what page you're on

07:42.086 --> 07:44.255
when you wake up all alone
in this big, empty room?

07:44.297 --> 07:46.257
It is a pain.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.343
And of course I miss you, too.

07:49.385 --> 07:51.596
All this break did was show me
that nothing

07:51.637 --> 07:53.222
is gonna get figured out
by not talking.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.683
So I guess the break
was helpful, right?

07:55.725 --> 07:57.768
Yeah, it was...

07:57.810 --> 07:59.770
so helpful.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.606
I just want a
chance to prove

08:01.647 --> 08:04.233
how important
you are to me.

08:04.275 --> 08:06.444
I just need the weekend.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.529
Please?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.740
I'm not ready
to make any promises.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.409
But okay.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.077
The weekend is yours.

08:15.119 --> 08:17.580
âª âª

08:24.754 --> 08:26.297
Hey, thank you, everyone,
for coming out.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.341
You know,
I'm just doing my small bit

08:28.382 --> 08:30.092
to help out the community.

08:30.134 --> 08:31.928
(reporters chattering)

08:31.969 --> 08:34.096
You did great.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.723
I heard a Gazette
reporter refer to you

08:35.765 --> 08:37.558
as "the billionaire
of the people."

08:37.600 --> 08:38.851
Well, I've always
looked good in plaid.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.312
I just hope it
translates into votes.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.855
Blake Carrington.

08:42.897 --> 08:44.565
(car door closes)

08:44.607 --> 08:46.150
Nice to finally
meet you in person.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.818
Lieutenant Governor.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.154
Yeah, I think they're
still packing boxes inside

08:50.196 --> 08:51.531
if you're here to help.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.282
Just hoping for a friendly chat.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.743
I'll go see if the press have
any questions.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.704
Why don't you two check out the
community composting display?

08:58.746 --> 09:01.582
It'll be a nice photo op.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
Your numbers were up
again this morning.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.795
Yeah.
Congratulations.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.838
Honestly, we thought
you'd be out by this point.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.841
But now I see you have
a secret weapon.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.343
Yeah.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.886
Thank you,
but I'm sure

09:13.928 --> 09:15.096
you didn't come here
to talk about my wife's

09:15.137 --> 09:16.973
many attributes.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.724
I'm here to ask you to
drop out of the race.

09:18.766 --> 09:19.767
Excuse me?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.602
Senator North is a friend.

09:21.644 --> 09:22.728
He told me all about
your play to get

09:22.770 --> 09:25.064
government land
for your airport.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.774
You drop out, it's yours.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.818
What's in it for you?

09:28.859 --> 09:31.195
The governor wants
Cavendish in office.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.738
They have a previous
relationship.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.949
And we'll be introducing
state legislation

09:34.991 --> 09:36.742
the governor needs support for
at the federal level,

09:36.784 --> 09:39.579
and Cavendish has made...
promises.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.956
Well, I can assure the governor

09:41.998 --> 09:43.499
a mutually beneficial
arrangement

09:43.541 --> 09:45.084
if he throws
his support behind me.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.837
This isn't a negotiation.
I have a direct line

09:47.878 --> 09:49.005
to the appropriations committee
and I can

09:49.046 --> 09:50.339
deregulate that land overnight.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.633
It's a win-win.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.635
You get your airport
and we leave

09:54.677 --> 09:56.137
the politicking
to the politicians.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.182
I was hoping you could
bring me up to speed

10:00.224 --> 10:02.018
on the FSN meeting I missed
while I was in L.A.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.895
Really? You want
to talk about work?

10:04.937 --> 10:07.565
After you left
on such a cliffhanger?

10:08.941 --> 10:11.652
Okay, I took your advice,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.863
and I didn't say
anything to Liam

10:13.904 --> 10:15.781
about, you know,
what happened last night.

10:15.823 --> 10:18.451
And we're going away
for the weekend.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.869
You and me?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.912
Sounds like fun.
(groans)

10:21.954 --> 10:23.706
Too soon to joke.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.249
I understand.
Do you?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.127
Because the fate of my marriage
rests on this weekend.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.420
You're
Fallon Carrington.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.255
If anyone can will a man
into submission,

10:31.297 --> 10:32.757
it's you.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.134
Well, I am glad
that you think so,

10:35.176 --> 10:37.345
because you are gonna have
to take the lead here again

10:37.386 --> 10:38.804
while I'm away.
Consider it done.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.348
Your company will be
humming along

10:40.389 --> 10:41.849
just as you left it,
when you return.

10:41.891 --> 10:42.850
Thank you.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.519
I may replace the couch, though.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.521
The springs leave something
to be desired.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.649
No, still too soon.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.859
(sighs) Eva?

10:54.278 --> 10:57.114
Clear my schedule-- I'm going
away for a couple days.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.241
No problem. I will forward
your calls to your cell.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.826
Oh, no, you know what,
forward them to Colin.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.536
He'll be running point
while Liam and I are traveling.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.163
You and Liam?

11:05.873 --> 11:08.125
I just mean, after last night,
I wasn't sure if you...

11:10.419 --> 11:12.797
I'm-I'm so sorry, none of this
is, uh, my business,

11:12.838 --> 11:15.007
so forward your calls, check.
(chuckles)

11:15.049 --> 11:18.427
I want to thank you
for your discretion.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.180
I mean, what you saw last night,
that is not me.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.391
I love my husband very much.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.975
And we're gonna work this out.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.894
I am so glad.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.647
And I know you will get
everything you deserve.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.233
I can't just backdate a divorce.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.859
Jeff said you're the best.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.278
Surely there's something
you can do.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.239
Filing fraudulent documents
could get me disbarred.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.116
The documents are real.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.910
I filed them,
I just didn't finalize them.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.538
Brady already believes
we're divorced.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.915
I'm asking
that you make it legal.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.250
I'm sorry.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.501
I can't help you.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.796
This isn't just

11:53.838 --> 11:55.631
about me, Henry.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.550
This is about protecting Jeff.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.385
He has a stake
in Dom-Mystique, too.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.429
I don't think he'd be

12:01.470 --> 12:03.764
too pleased to know
his lawyer put him at risk

12:03.806 --> 12:06.767
because he was afraid
of simple paperwork.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.478
I just told you...
it's not that simple.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.524
Okay, I'll see
if I can find any...

12:13.566 --> 12:15.276
gray areas.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.987
That's all I'm asking.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.280
You're doing what?

12:19.321 --> 12:20.740
Dropping out
of the race.

12:20.781 --> 12:23.617
I know it's a little surprising.
A little?

12:23.659 --> 12:26.537
Why? The numbers
have never been better!
Yeah,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.164
which is why I caught the eye
of some powerful people

12:28.205 --> 12:29.457
who want Cavendish
in office.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.752
They promised me my land
on the condition

12:32.793 --> 12:34.336
that I drop out
of the race.

12:34.378 --> 12:35.963
Well, that's great for you.
Did you forget about

12:36.005 --> 12:37.798
the promises you made to us?

12:37.840 --> 12:39.759
I didn't forget and
I did right by Jeff.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.262
I negotiated my land
and his launch permits.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.930
He and I are both walking away
with exactly what we want.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.432
What about me?

12:46.474 --> 12:48.434
Hey, your high school is
getting its athletic center.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.186
That's not nothing.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.688
That was supposed to be
the beginning, not the end.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.982
You were supposed to push
for an energy tax bill

12:55.024 --> 12:57.568
to help fund education programs.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.320
You can't be
okay with this.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.238
If you win,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.365
we can have the land
and keep our promises.

13:03.407 --> 13:04.909
Well, if I lose,
we'll have nothing.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.244
Listen, I may be polling well,

13:07.286 --> 13:08.954
but so was Hillary.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.790
No, this is our only guarantee.

13:10.831 --> 13:11.999
I'm gonna make
the announcement tomorrow.

13:15.544 --> 13:18.506
Oh! Hey, stranger.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.090
Look, I don't know
why you're still living here,

13:20.132 --> 13:21.717
but I'd get out
of this snake pit as soon

13:21.759 --> 13:22.843
as possible,
before you get bit.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.345
What happened? Are you okay?

13:24.386 --> 13:26.013
I promised the people

13:26.055 --> 13:27.932
that worked
alongside my father--

13:27.973 --> 13:30.226
the people that Blake poisoned--
that I would protect them.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.311
Would improve their lives.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.231
But Blake decided to stab us
all in the back... again.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.693
I might have something
that can help.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.153
Unless you have
a map that can find

13:41.195 --> 13:42.905
Blake's missing soul,
I doubt it.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.117
My father left me
with some insurance

13:47.159 --> 13:49.703
in case I ever found myself
on the wrong side of Blake.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.206
What kind of
insurance?

13:52.248 --> 13:54.375
I'll bring it to the hotel
tomorrow.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.126
Meet me there.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.171
Wow, this place sure is, uh...

13:59.213 --> 14:01.674
extravagant.
And confidential.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.093
Everybody has to sign a NDA when
they make a reservation here.

14:04.134 --> 14:07.012
Ah, I thought I saw Meghan
and Harry outside.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.806
Mr. Ridley and Ms. Carrington!

14:08.848 --> 14:11.267
Welcome to a weekend
in paradise.

14:11.308 --> 14:14.144
I'm Brianna,
your personal vacation director.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.438
Our vacation needs direction?

14:16.480 --> 14:17.982
(laughs)
Oh, you're too funny.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.526
But, yes, phones, please.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.195
Uh...
Well, this weekend is
all about us,

14:23.237 --> 14:25.573
and I don't want
any distractions.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.992
Wow. Yeah. Okay.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.785
Okay, these...

14:29.827 --> 14:32.872
have been individually coded.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.957
They can be used to message
one another, open your door,

14:34.999 --> 14:36.834
order in-room spa treatments

14:36.876 --> 14:39.253
and for atmospheric control.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.130
That all sounds great.
I guess we should head

14:41.171 --> 14:42.631
to our room.
Ooh, I almost forgot!

14:42.673 --> 14:45.175
Here is your itinerary.
I will see the two of you

14:45.217 --> 14:47.344
down at the communication
station in just a little bit.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.721
Thank you.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.514
"Communication station"?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.224
Is that a thing?

14:52.266 --> 14:53.893
What did you sign us up for?

14:53.934 --> 14:56.979
This hotel hosts two
couples' weekends a year.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.690
And since traditional
therapy didn't really work,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.942
I was thinking this
could be great. Look,

15:01.984 --> 15:03.736
I just want you to give me
a chance to prove to you

15:03.777 --> 15:05.988
that you are the most
important thing in my life.

15:06.030 --> 15:07.948
Okay? And what better
way to start than...

15:07.990 --> 15:10.284
waking up bright and early

15:10.326 --> 15:12.453
and rappelling
down the Wall of Trust?

15:14.413 --> 15:16.582
Um, paging
the wine butler.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.299
Okay, the Trust Wall is
our version

15:25.341 --> 15:27.384
of a "trust walk" exercise.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.261
The seeing partner
will verbally guide

15:29.303 --> 15:31.221
the blindfolded partner
down the wall.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.223
Your success on the wall
lives or dies

15:33.265 --> 15:35.100
on your ability
to communicate.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.352
I mean, but not, like,
literally.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.728
You're in a triple-point
safety harnesses.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.439
Oh, good, good.
Did you say blindfolded?

15:40.481 --> 15:42.942
This is not how I imagined
using blindfolds this weekend.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.152
LIAM: Okay, hey,
just relax.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.196
Start by leaning slightly back
into the rope.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.032
Okay.
Okay, good, good.
Now just below your right foot,

15:50.074 --> 15:51.408
there's gonna be
a chock-- sorry,

15:51.450 --> 15:53.285
a-a rock--
there-there you go.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.288
When did you become such
an expert at rock climbing?

15:56.330 --> 15:58.123
I-I've been going a lot
with friends.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.751
Okay, now move your right hand
down about six inches.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.086
(screams)

16:02.127 --> 16:03.963
Ooh, ooh, Liam!

16:04.004 --> 16:06.131
Help! Help! Help! Help!
Hey, hey, you're good,
you're good.

16:06.173 --> 16:08.342
All right?
L-Listen to my voice, okay?

16:08.384 --> 16:11.178
Okay, swing forward
with your right foot.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.888
Now once you get a toehold,
you should be able to get

16:12.930 --> 16:14.390
your left hand
on the wall.
Okay.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.100
Perfect, perfect!
Now get your left foot on

16:16.141 --> 16:17.935
and then you
basically got

16:17.977 --> 16:19.895
a ladder down
from there.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.689
Stay close to that wall.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.357
Two feet-- I'm right here.
Okay.

16:23.399 --> 16:25.526
Jump down. Jump down.
Jump down?

16:25.567 --> 16:27.111
(whoops)
Oh, my God!

16:27.152 --> 16:29.071
I made it! Wow!

16:29.113 --> 16:31.657
Wow, that was...
Awesome?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.450
I was gonna say intense.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.119
I hope you like
your rock-climbing friends

16:35.160 --> 16:36.578
because I am never
doing that again.

16:36.620 --> 16:39.123
(chuckling)
Oh, not so fast, you two!

16:39.164 --> 16:41.667
First, a quick stop
at the Tent of Truth.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.210
Because honesty is

16:43.252 --> 16:44.753
the cornerstone
of every relationship.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.422
Hold on, Bri.

16:46.463 --> 16:48.340
I didn't see anything
on your itinerary

16:48.382 --> 16:50.426
that said anything about tents,

16:50.467 --> 16:53.220
truth or honesty.
We keep it off the itinerary.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.764
The exercise works best if you
don't have time to overthink it.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.142
Well, I'm thinking we should
quit while we're ahead.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.019
You know, or I could...

17:00.060 --> 17:01.937
climb the wall again?

17:01.979 --> 17:03.856
Hey, you're the one
who said you wanted

17:03.897 --> 17:05.524
a chance to prove you could
prioritize our marriage.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.943
And I do,
but wouldn't you rather

17:07.985 --> 17:09.611
me prove myself in a bikini

17:09.653 --> 17:11.405
over a cocktail with a tiny,
little umbrella?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.990
No?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.284
Okay, to the Truth Tent.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.077
Yay!

17:17.119 --> 17:19.288
You're gonna love it.
Mm.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.498
The DJ sent over his rider--
do you want that

17:21.540 --> 17:23.417
on the catering budget
or the music budget?

17:23.459 --> 17:25.461
(yawns)
Yes, yes.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.879
Great, sounds perfect.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.051
(gasps)

17:32.092 --> 17:33.844
Sam, are you watching
a telenovela?!

17:33.886 --> 17:36.055
I'm sorry, but Adriana
thinks her ex-husband

17:36.096 --> 17:38.265
kidnapped her son,
when really an evil nurse

17:38.307 --> 17:39.808
took the kid
to the hospital's secret lab

17:39.850 --> 17:41.393
and is running experiments
on him.

17:42.853 --> 17:44.938
Oh, have I told you
how great it is

17:44.980 --> 17:46.690
to have you back
as my events manager?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.358
This was a one-time favor

17:48.400 --> 17:51.945
for Blake's
political gala/the club opening.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.114
(clears throat) I'm gonna go
check on that caviar shipment.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.574
Bye.

17:57.826 --> 17:59.870
Sammy Jo Jones!

17:59.912 --> 18:01.455
Just the man I wanted to see.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.040
Uh, I need a favor.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.750
Well, can you ask someone else?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.376
I'm kind of swamped here.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.753
No, it's got to be you.
I need a Spanish speaker.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.671
Well, ask Cristal.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.091
No, I need someone that no one
at the hospital knows.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.675
It-it'll be super quick. I...

18:13.717 --> 18:16.053
I need a tiny distraction
while I delete a file

18:16.095 --> 18:17.763
from the digital archives.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.223
Sounds shady, I'm out.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.101
Shady?
(scoffs)

18:24.186 --> 18:26.271
I let Leo die on my table
to save your life.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.940
The least you can do is
give me half an hour

18:27.981 --> 18:29.525
of your time to
save my future.

18:29.566 --> 18:31.944
(sighs) Fine.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.321
But then we're even.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.202
Tell me you're calling
with good news.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.204
I'm calling with news.

18:42.246 --> 18:44.414
I'm unable to take your case.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.250
Surely there's something
you can do.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.001
However, I can tell you that

18:48.043 --> 18:50.671
theoretically, if a court clerk

18:50.712 --> 18:52.673
admitted to making
a clerical error

18:52.714 --> 18:55.092
while filing divorce papers,
a judge could sign

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
a nunc pro tunc

18:57.219 --> 18:59.346
and backdate said divorce.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.349
So I need to find a clerk
willing to take the blame.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.143
And then forget this call
ever happened.

19:05.102 --> 19:06.854
I have to call you back.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.897
Please don't.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.024
Hate what you've done
with the place.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.776
You're trespassing.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.529
Relax, I'm just here
for some girl talk.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.614
After all, it's been ages
since our...

19:17.656 --> 19:19.658
little chat
in the diamond-less mine.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.910
I think we've done
enough chatting for a lifetime.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.121
Don't you?
But there's so much more
to talk about.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.790
I saw Jeff's lawyer
leaving here yesterday.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.917
And it didn't take
much digging to find out

19:28.959 --> 19:32.337
that your not-so-ex-husband
is back in town.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.922
Does this monologue have
a point?

19:33.964 --> 19:35.924
The point is...

19:35.966 --> 19:38.552
I think you're trying to avoid

19:38.594 --> 19:41.388
turning over half of
your new fortune by getting...

19:41.430 --> 19:43.515
(whispers):
...a secret divorce.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.142
Get out of my loft.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.894
Oh, I will.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.021
As soon as you give me

19:49.062 --> 19:51.315
a financial stake
in Dom-Mystique.
(laughs)

19:51.356 --> 19:53.901
I think 20% is fair.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.528
I would say 30,
but I'm not greedy.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.864
You're delusional.
Oh...

19:58.906 --> 20:02.367
After all,
that's less than 50%,

20:02.409 --> 20:04.203
which is what Brady would get

20:04.244 --> 20:06.205
if I let
your little secret slip.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.082
You got 24 hours.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.923
You know I can't have ownership
papers drawn up that quickly.

20:15.964 --> 20:18.383
Get creative.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.844
And you've got
to do better than this.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.846
(groans)

20:22.888 --> 20:24.348
What is this?

20:27.976 --> 20:30.437
Wait, is it...

20:30.479 --> 20:32.814
A list of every Carrington
secret my father ever learned?

20:32.856 --> 20:35.234
Yeah.
My dad loved Blake, but...

20:35.275 --> 20:36.735
he wasn't an idiot.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.528
He wanted to protect himself...
and me.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.656
Wow, this is just...

20:40.697 --> 20:42.199
I haven't even read
all of it yet.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.700
I feel weird
'cause Blake's

20:43.742 --> 20:45.535
been so nice to me
since the whole rehab thing.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.871
But I know what your
friendship meant to my dad.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.289
And I-I think he'd want me

20:49.331 --> 20:51.083
to share it with you
if it could help.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.961
There's enough dirt in here
to take down Blake for good.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.172
And I'm not just talking
about his political career.

20:57.214 --> 20:58.465
I know.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.841
You're welcome.

20:59.883 --> 21:02.010
Jeff?

21:02.052 --> 21:03.512
Are you okay?

21:03.553 --> 21:05.889
Your phone keeps going
straight to voice mail.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.766
I'm fine.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.018
And why are you lying around
and why is it so dark in here?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.145
Oh, no, leave it.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.981
I turned my phone off
'cause I've got a migraine.

21:14.022 --> 21:17.401
Hence the lying down...
and darkness.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.486
Maybe I should call a doctor.

21:20.821 --> 21:22.864
I'm just stressed.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.366
So...

21:24.408 --> 21:26.410
what's so important
you couldn't wait?

21:26.451 --> 21:29.037
I found a New York court clerk

21:29.079 --> 21:31.081
who is willing
to sign an affidavit

21:31.123 --> 21:32.499
that she made a clerical error

21:32.541 --> 21:35.127
while filing my divorce papers.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.379
Sounds like good news.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.965
It is, but it will take her
72 hours

21:40.007 --> 21:43.510
to get it notarized and Alexis
is threatening to expose me.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.345
Alexis?
She knows I'm still

21:45.387 --> 21:46.638
married to Brady and she wants

21:46.680 --> 21:48.515
an ownership stake
in my company.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.559
I know you two are
still friendly.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.769
So I was hoping you
could talk to her.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.479
The last time I asked her
for a favor,

21:54.521 --> 21:56.732
it cost me an original Ruscha.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.276
Unfortunately, I don't
have any more priceless art.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.488
I've worked too hard to give
Alexis part of my company.

22:03.530 --> 22:06.033
My mother's legacy.

22:06.074 --> 22:07.951
I'll just come clean to Brady

22:07.993 --> 22:09.911
and hope that he's the man
that I think he is.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.455
Are you insane?

22:11.496 --> 22:13.248
If he's the man I think he is,

22:13.290 --> 22:14.624
you'll be giving away millions.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.918
What other choice do I have?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.006
Who'd like to go first?

22:21.048 --> 22:23.091
Liam. I just...

22:23.133 --> 22:24.676
I think he's got a lot to share.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.887
Not wrong there.
All right, then.

22:26.928 --> 22:29.890
I'm going to walk you through
a Naikan Reflection,

22:29.931 --> 22:32.225
or the practice
of "looking inward."

22:32.267 --> 22:33.894
First reflection.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.729
What have you received

22:35.771 --> 22:37.731
from your partner
in this relationship?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.108
Um, let's see.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.486
A place to sleep

22:42.527 --> 22:44.529
while my partner works
around the clock.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.615
Um...

22:46.656 --> 22:48.533
free meals, although those

22:48.575 --> 22:50.077
technically come from the cook.

22:50.118 --> 22:51.661
Okay, sounds
like someone's hiding

22:51.703 --> 22:53.747
behind a little bit
of sarcasm there.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.458
So we'll move on
to question two,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.419
and have you reflect on what
you bring to the relationship.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.382
I bring, uh...

23:06.510 --> 23:09.137
I mean, I-I-I always try to...

23:13.225 --> 23:15.852
Actually, I'm not sure.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.771
What?

23:17.813 --> 23:20.607
No, you're smart, you're loyal,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.692
you're funny...
some of the time. (chuckles)

23:22.734 --> 23:26.071
Fallon's the CEO
of an international corporation.

23:27.114 --> 23:29.199
This-this year
I wrote an article.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.451
Yeah, an amazing article
that won him a huge award.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.828
Yeah, that led
to nothing.

23:32.869 --> 23:35.122
No book deal,
not even a freelance gig.

23:35.163 --> 23:37.874
I mean, I-I thought
it was going to open up doors,

23:37.916 --> 23:40.252
but I'm right back
where I started.

23:40.293 --> 23:43.171
I haven't been honest
with either of us.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.923
You haven't?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.092
I'm upset that our marriage
always seems

23:47.134 --> 23:49.261
to take a back seat
to everything else in your life.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.055
But I'm also
mad at myself

23:52.097 --> 23:53.723
for not being
the husband you deserve.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.019
I mean, Fallon, I want to be
someone that you're proud of.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.479
I am.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.106
I-I think I've been
lashing out at Fallon

24:01.148 --> 24:04.276
so I didn't have to admit that I
was feeling like such a failure.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.946
Wow, I can't believe

24:07.988 --> 24:10.949
how good that felt
to say out loud.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.576
Maybe there is something
to this whole Truth Tent.

24:12.617 --> 24:13.785
Yeah.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.121
Really, really nice work, Liam.
Thank you.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.581
Thank you.

24:17.622 --> 24:19.624
Shall we move onto Fallon,

24:19.666 --> 24:22.169
and see what things she's ready
to get off her chest?

24:22.210 --> 24:23.628
Yeah, yeah.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.172
Is it warmer in here?

24:25.213 --> 24:27.841
No, all of our tents are
carefully climate-controlled.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.551
Oh.
So let's start with
the third question.

24:29.593 --> 24:30.802
Sorry.

24:30.844 --> 24:33.013
"What mistakes have I made

24:33.054 --> 24:34.973
in my partnership?"

24:35.015 --> 24:37.601
(exhaling)

24:39.144 --> 24:40.896
I'm gonna faint.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.399
Fallon?
I'm gonna faint.

24:50.071 --> 24:52.032
All right, Dr. Larson should be
here in about ten minutes.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.450
We need to make this quick.
I can delete the files,

24:53.492 --> 24:54.784
but I'll need
to get her ID badge--

24:54.826 --> 24:56.369
So you can access
the database, yes.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.621
You've said it
6,000 times.

24:57.662 --> 24:58.705
Can we get
this over with?

25:01.958 --> 25:03.627
I-I'm sorry,
I don't speak Spanish.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.544
No, no, no, no, no...

25:07.714 --> 25:09.132
Dr. Carrington,
everything okay?
Lucia,

25:09.174 --> 25:10.634
this man is hysterical.
By any chance,

25:10.675 --> 25:12.010
do you speak Spanish?
I do.

26:13.029 --> 26:16.241
Oh, Dr. Larson.
Wow, you are early.

26:16.283 --> 26:18.493
Dr. Carrington, don't you
have more important things

26:18.535 --> 26:20.120
to do than supervise
clerical work?

26:20.161 --> 26:22.289
Just wanted to make sure
there are no issues.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.416
Lucia, would you do me a favor,
and pull up a copy

26:24.457 --> 26:27.335
of Dr. Larson's
trial research, please?

26:27.377 --> 26:29.212
Yeah, of course.
Thanks.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.719
Lucia, everything okay?

26:35.760 --> 26:38.430
Yeah, I just can't seem to find
the files for that trial.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.807
Wait, I'm gonna try one more
thing I just remembered.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.892
And...

26:42.934 --> 26:44.769
I think I got it.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.188
And...

26:47.230 --> 26:49.858
No, there's
nothing in the system.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.860
So weird.
I'll take the
hard copies then.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.695
Oh, no, those are long gone.

26:53.737 --> 26:55.196
Have you forgotten how it works?

26:55.238 --> 26:57.324
Uh, we shred the hard copies
once they've been scanned.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.117
Yours must not
have been scanned.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.327
I scanned them myself.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.369
Well, obviously not.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.121
Just another example

27:03.163 --> 27:04.998
of your careless work.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.794
Hey.

27:09.836 --> 27:11.796
You've been pretty quiet
the whole drive home.

27:11.838 --> 27:13.298
Is everything okay?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.842
Other than, you know,
almost fainting?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.260
No.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.640
I thought I could just
move on from my mistakes,

27:21.681 --> 27:24.017
and leave them in
the past, but...

27:24.059 --> 27:26.061
I was wrong.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.021
We really need
to talk, Liam.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.231
Okay.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.525
Hey, you know you can
tell me anything.

27:34.444 --> 27:37.072
I... I don't think
this is the place.

27:37.113 --> 27:39.616
No, especially not with
that creepy valet guy

27:39.658 --> 27:41.785
staring at us, so...

27:41.826 --> 27:43.745
will you meet me back at
the manor in a few hours?

27:43.787 --> 27:45.580
Yeah.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.166
It'll give me time to pack,
so I can move back home.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.043
Okay.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.923
The warehouse sends inventory
directly to the consumers,

27:54.964 --> 27:57.801
as well as bulk shipments
to our retailers.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.552
That's all fine,
but where's

27:59.594 --> 28:01.346
the good stuff I can
take home with me?

28:01.388 --> 28:02.972
Right behind that door.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.893
I will sign over 20%
of my company

28:06.935 --> 28:09.270
contingent upon two things.

28:09.312 --> 28:12.315
One, you keep
your mouth shut about Brady.

28:12.357 --> 28:14.442
And two...

28:14.484 --> 28:16.194
you learn about the product.

28:16.236 --> 28:17.737
Give me your phone.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.072
I'm not giving you my phone.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.198
Then you don't go in.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.325
I can't take a chance

28:22.367 --> 28:24.119
that any photos leak
before my feature

28:24.160 --> 28:25.620
in Women's Wear Daily comes out.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.539
And you don't trust me?

28:27.580 --> 28:30.375
Right, dumb question.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.043
(clears throat)

28:35.672 --> 28:39.134
This is where we keep
all of "the good stuff,"

28:39.175 --> 28:42.303
as you so eloquently put it.

28:44.055 --> 28:47.308
I don't see anything good
but granola bars!

28:47.350 --> 28:49.477
What?!
Dominique, open this door!

28:49.519 --> 28:51.563
Open this!
Do you hear me?

28:51.604 --> 28:54.190
And there are some water bottles
and a bucket.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.192
I'm not a monster.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.820
I'll be back to let you out on
Monday when my divorce is final.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.823
(exhales)

29:01.865 --> 29:04.033
I have had some
very inventive

29:04.075 --> 29:05.952
lovers, your son included.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.037
You think I can't pick a lock?

29:08.079 --> 29:10.039
Of course you can.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.917
You've pissed me off,
so the timeline's moving up.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.255
Get a contract on my desk
by 5:00 p.m.

29:17.297 --> 29:20.133
or Mr. Brady and I
are gonna have a little chat.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.262
Fallon! You're back early.

29:24.304 --> 29:26.639
Um... did something happen
on your trip?

29:26.681 --> 29:29.392
Yeah. It went great.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.686
Colin will be here in a half
an hour, so hold my calls.

29:31.728 --> 29:33.229
Will do. Uh, is this

29:33.271 --> 29:35.440
for business or personal?

29:35.482 --> 29:37.859
Just asking in
case you want me

29:37.901 --> 29:40.320
to make myself,
you know, scarce.

29:40.361 --> 29:42.489
I'm making it clear to Colin
that what happened

29:42.530 --> 29:44.949
was a mistake and it's time
he goes his separate way.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.826
I do appreciate

29:46.868 --> 29:48.661
your continued discretion.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.413
Of course.
But I think

29:50.455 --> 29:52.415
that maybe let's go back
to having

29:52.457 --> 29:54.250
normal professional
boundaries after today.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.460
Okay?

29:55.502 --> 29:57.170
Okay.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.847
Liam? It's Eva.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.266
I think
I may have lost my necklace

30:10.308 --> 30:12.435
in your car
after the event last week.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.355
Oh, thank you so much,
yeah, I need to return it

30:15.396 --> 30:18.066
to the friend
I borrowed it from tonight.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.444
Any chance you can swing
by the office in 45 minutes?

30:21.486 --> 30:23.279
Perfect.

30:23.321 --> 30:25.156
See you soon.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.792
Remember, short and sweet.
You've got a family emergency

30:35.834 --> 30:37.544
that needs your attention
and you're wishing

30:37.585 --> 30:38.920
Cavendish the best of luck.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.630
Got to admit, I'm...

30:40.672 --> 30:42.131
kind of gonna miss this.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.008
(indistinct chatter)

30:46.135 --> 30:49.180
Thank you for coming
on short notice.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.933
Um, as you all know,
I entered this race

30:51.975 --> 30:53.810
because I wanted to help

30:53.852 --> 30:55.520
better the lives
of my fellow Georgians.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.105
But I've never kept
a secret of the fact

30:57.146 --> 30:58.606
that I am a family man

30:58.648 --> 31:01.401
and family
always comes first, so...

31:01.442 --> 31:04.320
I have some news
that I need to share with you.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.947
Can you confirm rumors
that you've got your eye

31:05.989 --> 31:07.991
on a cabinet position for 2023

31:08.032 --> 31:09.659
and that you're already
on the White House's radar?

31:09.701 --> 31:11.786
(reporters whispering)

31:13.121 --> 31:14.581
Well, I don't respond to rumors,

31:14.622 --> 31:16.291
but, obviously,
if I was offered

31:16.332 --> 31:18.209
a cabinet position,
I wouldn't decline.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.003
Do you feel more pressure
to win with that on the line?

31:20.044 --> 31:22.088
Well, I never feel pressure,
Melanie.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.674
Well, you're already one
of America's richest men.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.009
If you were to be
a cabinet member,

31:26.050 --> 31:27.427
you'd become one of America's

31:27.468 --> 31:28.887
most influential men.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.013
That's a lot of power
for one person.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.352
As Voltaire once said,

31:36.394 --> 31:39.188
"With great power comes
great responsibility."

31:39.230 --> 31:40.940
Which brings me
to the reason

31:40.982 --> 31:42.650
I called this press
conference today.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.778
To announce my support
for an energy tax bill

31:45.820 --> 31:48.072
that funds education

31:48.114 --> 31:49.699
in the great state
of Georgia.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.327
I have big plans
for renewable energy

31:52.368 --> 31:54.746
to become a reality

31:54.787 --> 31:57.248
to preserve the future
for our children.

31:57.290 --> 31:59.125
Thank you.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.252
(reporters clamoring)

32:01.294 --> 32:02.795
What the hell was that?

32:02.837 --> 32:04.589
We had a deal.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.215
Sorry, plans change.

32:06.257 --> 32:08.217
You can kiss your
airport goodbye.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.053
When I win this election,
I'll get my airport,

32:10.094 --> 32:12.680
and you...
can kiss your job goodbye.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.897
Dominique,
I wasn't expecting you.

32:23.816 --> 32:26.110
Not that... I'm complaining.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.073
What is this?

32:30.114 --> 32:32.283
Half of my current assets.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.494
Which you are legally
entitled to because...

32:34.535 --> 32:36.746
we're still married.
What?

32:36.788 --> 32:38.247
I don't understand.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.874
Why didn't you say something?

32:39.916 --> 32:42.293
It's a long story.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.170
I just wanted
to enjoy our time together

32:44.212 --> 32:46.381
without complicating things.

32:46.422 --> 32:48.883
But I can't live
in a fantasy, so...

32:48.925 --> 32:51.052
we should get
an official divorce.

32:52.762 --> 32:54.597
Which would make
that money yours.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.437
What are you doing?

33:01.479 --> 33:03.189
I don't want
your money.

33:03.231 --> 33:04.524
I just want a chance
to be with the woman

33:04.565 --> 33:05.984
I fell in love with
over a decade ago.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.074
Just a little thank you for
helping that poor man earlier...

33:13.116 --> 33:15.034
What's going on?
Just came back for my files.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.703
Do you have low-grade amnesia?

33:16.744 --> 33:18.079
The opposite,
actually.

33:18.121 --> 33:20.289
Driving home, I suddenly
remembered that copier

33:20.331 --> 33:22.375
stores a copy of all scans
for three months.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.503
I was sure I scanned
my files, so I came back.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.880
And good thing you did-- we were
able to reprint everything.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.341
That's wonderful.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.676
It feels good to have
my work back where it belongs.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.344
With me.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.013
I bet.

33:35.054 --> 33:36.973
Well...

33:37.015 --> 33:39.017
all's well that ends well.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.269
(elevator bell dings)
Right on time.

33:41.310 --> 33:43.646
Ready to turn over
the key to my loft?

33:43.688 --> 33:45.815
You can choke
on that damn key.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.859
And your threats.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.777
Brady knows everything.

33:49.819 --> 33:51.904
You have no more
leverage, Alexis.

33:51.946 --> 33:54.198
I'm so sorry.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.951
How quickly did he leave town
with half your money?

33:56.993 --> 33:59.162
You know, it's funny.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.123
You tried
to destroy my happiness,

34:02.165 --> 34:04.834
but all you did was shine
a light on your sad life.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.627
My sad life?

34:06.669 --> 34:08.296
Do you want
a tour of the penthouse

34:08.337 --> 34:10.673
before you go home
to your little stable?

34:10.715 --> 34:13.593
You're obsessed with me
because I managed to do

34:13.634 --> 34:15.845
what you never could--
become a real member

34:15.887 --> 34:17.930
of the Carrington family,

34:17.972 --> 34:20.600
have huge success,
and, oh,

34:20.641 --> 34:23.603
my kids still talk to me.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.772
Three strikes.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.356
You're pathetic.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.701
You were right.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.704
Of course I was.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.333
I still can't believe I ripped
up a seven-figure check.

34:45.374 --> 34:47.960
We needed to convince her
that your affection is real.

34:48.002 --> 34:51.464
And don't worry,
once we've destroyed Dominique--

34:51.506 --> 34:54.133
emotionally, spiritually
and financially--

34:54.175 --> 34:56.803
you will get your millions,
I will get my revenge.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.554
And everyone is happy.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.473
Well...

35:00.515 --> 35:02.725
almost everyone.

35:03.893 --> 35:05.520
Happy to report
that things around here

35:05.561 --> 35:07.980
have been utterly boring
in your absence.

35:08.022 --> 35:10.858
Well, it's nice to know I left
the place in such good hands.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.903
Which is why it's so hard
for me to say this.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.989
I need to buy you
out of your shares.

35:17.031 --> 35:18.991
The romantic getaway
went well, did it?

35:19.033 --> 35:21.160
Actually...

35:21.202 --> 35:22.870
I almost fell off a 50-foot wall

35:22.912 --> 35:24.831
and had a panic attack
in a Truth Tent.

35:24.872 --> 35:26.374
Hmm?
Don't ask.

35:26.415 --> 35:28.501
The point is...
I tried to move on,

35:28.543 --> 35:31.170
like you suggested,
but my body had other ideas.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.922
Turns out, keeping secrets

35:32.964 --> 35:34.924
from my husband is
bad for my health.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.260
So you told him?
Not yet.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.513
And he might forgive me or he
might never talk to me again.

35:40.555 --> 35:43.599
But either way,
I can't work with you anymore.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.644
I get it, although it's a shame.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.021
Consulting here's been the most
fun I've had in a long while.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.898
I guess that'll
teach me to...

35:50.940 --> 35:52.483
stop sleeping with CEOs.

36:00.449 --> 36:02.618
Can I come in?
Of course.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.997
I heard what you said
at the press conference.

36:06.038 --> 36:08.457
And just wanted
to say thank you.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.876
I know how hard

36:09.917 --> 36:12.295
it can be for you
to do the right thing.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.755
(laughs)
You're funny.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.924
You're funny, but yeah!

36:16.966 --> 36:18.259
It was the right thing.

36:18.301 --> 36:20.595
Hey, why don't
you have a seat?

36:20.636 --> 36:23.306
I was just about to track
down some champagne,

36:23.347 --> 36:26.392
so we could toast
to our revitalized campaign.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.775
That press conference
was amazing.

36:34.817 --> 36:37.195
I know.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.363
I wasn't sure he was
gonna change his mind

36:39.405 --> 36:41.949
until he actually
started talking.

36:41.991 --> 36:45.036
So how much did you end up
having to pay that reporter?

36:45.077 --> 36:48.206
Let's just say she can probably
retire a few years early now.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.875
I got to say I'm impressed.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.461
I didn't think you had it in you
to go behind Blake's back.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.463
It was for the greater good.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.423
I knew appealing to Blake's

36:57.465 --> 36:59.217
sense of community
would never work.

36:59.258 --> 37:00.343
Because he doesn't have one.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.637
But he's never been able

37:02.678 --> 37:05.097
to resist the chance
to get more power.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.475
Crafty... and cold.

37:07.516 --> 37:09.268
But...

37:09.310 --> 37:11.312
I appreciate you having my back.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.273
It wasn't entirely altruistic.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.234
As the head of a charity,
my ability

37:16.275 --> 37:18.945
to effect change is limited.

37:18.986 --> 37:21.030
But as Blake's partner in this,

37:21.072 --> 37:23.199
I'll finally have
some real influence.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.619
Now all we have to do is win.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.329
Wow.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.039
Guess Blake isn't the only one

37:30.081 --> 37:32.124
who couldn't resist
the allure of power.

37:32.166 --> 37:34.293
DOMINIQUE:
Jeff? Are you home?

37:34.335 --> 37:36.170
Jeff! Oh...

37:36.212 --> 37:38.631
I'm going to break
my neck in here.

37:46.973 --> 37:50.309
Look... even flipping through
this thing made me feel dirty.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.728
Maybe we should get rid of it.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.647
Really?
Well, there are

37:54.689 --> 37:56.899
some things
you just don't need to know.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.527
And I know
if this thing's available,

37:59.568 --> 38:01.737
I might be tempted
to use it someday.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.781
I don't want to be
that kind of person.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.493
I don't think you do, either.

38:34.645 --> 38:36.814
(exhales)

38:36.856 --> 38:39.191
Thanks for keeping
us both decent.

38:41.277 --> 38:42.611
FALLON:
Hi, there.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.450
That took me longer
than I thought.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.703
So, um...

38:53.289 --> 38:55.124
I have something to tell you.

38:55.166 --> 38:57.543
And...

38:57.585 --> 38:59.920
I think it's better if I just...

38:59.962 --> 39:01.964
get it out...

39:02.006 --> 39:04.258
you know,
before I lose my nerve.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.346
Wait, why haven't you unpacked?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.186
You're sleeping with Colin?

39:17.229 --> 39:18.898
I came by the office,

39:18.939 --> 39:21.317
and I heard you two together.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.778
Liam, that's not
how I wanted you to find out.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.447
Oh, I-I'm sorry,
I guess this is my fault, then.

39:27.990 --> 39:30.034
So Colin...

39:30.076 --> 39:31.827
is really what you were doing

39:31.869 --> 39:33.329
all those times
when you were working late?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.247
I mean...

39:35.289 --> 39:37.541
you even had me believing
that you hated the guy.

39:37.583 --> 39:39.627
What a joke that was!

39:39.668 --> 39:41.295
I did hate him.
Oh, my God...

39:41.337 --> 39:43.589
I did hate him, Liam, and...

39:43.631 --> 39:45.132
it was not a thing.

39:45.174 --> 39:47.468
Okay? It was one time.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.929
And it was a huge, huge mistake.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.056
Oh, well, in that case,
everything's cool, then.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.183
You left me.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.186
You stopped answering my calls.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.854
I got a call from that attorney.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.606
I thought you filed for divorce.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.317
I was upset
and I was miserable.

40:03.359 --> 40:06.237
And I made a terrible decision.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.655
But I still love you, Liam.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.572
Don't touch me.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.494
I'm supposed to believe
that you were gonna tell me?

40:13.536 --> 40:14.578
I was gonna tell you--
that's what

40:14.620 --> 40:15.788
I wanted to talk about tonight.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.331
Oh, what, a-after you stopped by

40:17.373 --> 40:19.041
to see your boyfriend first?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.294
I can't believe
I thought that we could

40:22.336 --> 40:24.338
actually make this work.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.006
Liam, please.

40:26.048 --> 40:28.134
Oh, please what?

40:30.928 --> 40:33.097
Please what, Fallon?

40:33.139 --> 40:34.974
Forgive you?

40:38.060 --> 40:39.895
I don't think I can.

40:42.898 --> 40:45.401
It's over, Fallon.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.992
âª âª

41:22.188 --> 41:25.065

41:51.509 --> 41:53.469
âª Here comes the bride. âª
