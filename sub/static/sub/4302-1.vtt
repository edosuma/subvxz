01:43.577 --> 01:47.411
<i>A fire that claimed three lives</i>
<i>in a South Bay warehouse yesterday...</i>

01:47.614 --> 01:50.515
<i>... is believed to have been</i>
<i>deliberately set.</i>

01:50.718 --> 01:53.983
<i>South Bay has been plagued</i>
<i>by a series of fires...</i>

01:54.188 --> 01:55.655
<i>... all of a similar nature.</i>

01:55.856 --> 01:58.290
<i>Authorities believe</i>
<i>arson is involved.</i>

01:58.492 --> 02:00.392
<i>They have no suspects at this time.</i>

02:02.329 --> 02:06.527
<i>Jazz composer Edward Barla was</i>
<i>eulogized today in a private ceremony.</i>

02:06.734 --> 02:10.693
<i>Barla was best known for the tunes</i>
<i>"Midnight Hearts" and "Just For You."</i>

02:10.904 --> 02:13.031
<i>Edward Barla, dead at the age of 56.</i>

02:15.809 --> 02:20.610
<i>The murder trial of Lou Janero ended</i>
<i>today. Samantha Walker has the story.</i>

02:20.814 --> 02:22.509
<i>After four days of deliberation...</i>

02:22.716 --> 02:26.584
<i>... the jury found Lou Janero guilty</i>
<i>of the murder of Paul Cirela.</i>

02:26.787 --> 02:31.451
<i>Cirela, part of Janero's organization,</i>
<i>was set to testify against Janero...</i>

02:31.658 --> 02:35.594
<i>... in an upcoming trial on charges</i>
<i>of bookmaking and tax evasion.</i>

02:35.796 --> 02:40.130
<i>Assistant D.A., Thomas McSherry,</i>
<i>credited Inspector Harry Callahan...</i>

02:40.334 --> 02:44.737
<i>... for his part in the successful</i>
<i>prosecution of Lou Janero.</i>

02:44.938 --> 02:48.806
<i>A great deal of the credit</i>
<i>should go to Inspector Callahan.</i>

02:49.009 --> 02:51.136
<i>He put Lou Janero out of business.</i>

02:52.012 --> 02:56.972
<i>The inspector's evidence not only</i>
<i>implicated Janero in the murder...</i>

02:57.184 --> 03:02.053
<i>... but also provided the means to file</i>
<i>additional charges against Janero...</i>

03:02.256 --> 03:04.224
<i>... for bookmaking</i>
<i>and illegal gambling.</i>

03:06.560 --> 03:09.688
<i>I'm Samantha Walker for Channel 8.</i>
<i>Back to you, Pat.</i>

04:55.669 --> 04:57.637
Get off my ass.

06:36.970 --> 06:38.198
He's going.

06:40.974 --> 06:43.408
Did you recognize
any of the attackers?

06:43.610 --> 06:47.307
Is this attack connected to your
testimony at the Janero trial?

06:47.514 --> 06:50.608
Has Janero put out a contract
on your life?

06:50.817 --> 06:52.444
Were these Janero's men?

06:52.652 --> 06:54.449
Have you received death threats?

06:55.255 --> 06:57.815
Has the department offered
any extra protection?

06:58.025 --> 07:01.017
The department will issue
a complete statement...

07:01.228 --> 07:04.527
...as soon as we've conducted
our own investigation.

07:05.065 --> 07:08.501
$13,453.63.

07:08.702 --> 07:11.466
That's how much
an unmarked squad car costs.

07:11.671 --> 07:14.162
That's the third car
you've trashed this month.

07:14.374 --> 07:16.274
- Lou Janero.
- What?

07:16.476 --> 07:18.910
His men shot up the car.
Send him the bill.

07:19.112 --> 07:20.010
Very funny.

07:20.213 --> 07:24.081
See how funny it is behind a desk,
because you're off the street.

07:24.284 --> 07:25.581
All this for a car?

07:25.786 --> 07:27.947
At Lieutenant Ackerman's request.

07:28.155 --> 07:30.385
The chief approved.
It's for your own good.

07:30.590 --> 07:34.390
- If you think I'm gonna...
- Just until we handle Janero.

07:34.594 --> 07:38.655
He may be in prison, but it's clear
he's calling the shots. Literally.

07:38.865 --> 07:43.564
Can't have our newest hero turned to
Swiss cheese before the commendation.

07:43.770 --> 07:46.671
See? You're getting a commendation.

07:47.841 --> 07:49.365
Swell.

07:51.645 --> 07:54.614
It's time we took advantage
of the press you're getting.

07:54.815 --> 07:56.680
How do you propose to do that?

07:56.883 --> 08:01.582
It's my opinion that you should
work with me in public relations.

08:01.788 --> 08:04.985
Opinions are like assholes.
Everybody has one.

08:07.260 --> 08:10.696
You don't realize what you've done
for the department's image.

08:10.897 --> 08:13.422
You just put a major
crime figure in prison.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.500
You've got an extremely high
visibility right now.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.170
And for once, it's positive.

08:18.405 --> 08:21.067
You know what that means
in terms of recruitment?

08:21.274 --> 08:24.072
Look at this.
Look at this copy we're getting.

08:24.277 --> 08:27.508
We've never been
this swamped for interviews.

08:27.714 --> 08:30.274
I'm not some dog-and-pony act.

08:31.418 --> 08:35.251
It's important we maximize your public
relations value while we can.

08:35.455 --> 08:39.289
Getting close and personal
with reporters isn't my job.

08:39.493 --> 08:42.053
Your job is to promote the department.

08:42.261 --> 08:44.856
How positive would it be
if I resigned...

08:45.065 --> 08:46.430
...lieutenant?

08:50.203 --> 08:52.000
Don't misunderstand me.

08:52.205 --> 08:55.766
Harry, all I'm asking for
is a little cooperation.

08:57.144 --> 09:00.841
All right, we don't have to pull you
off the street completely.

09:01.047 --> 09:03.447
If you'd just be more cooperative
with the press.

09:03.650 --> 09:04.639
Anything else?

09:04.851 --> 09:06.284
Yeah.

09:07.521 --> 09:09.182
Quan, will you come in here?

09:10.891 --> 09:14.987
Quan's moving over from the youth gang
task force to Homicide.

09:15.195 --> 09:18.596
Good, Homicide can always use a cop
with Al's experience.

09:18.798 --> 09:19.992
I'm glad you agree.

09:20.200 --> 09:24.068
If you want to stay on the street,
you take Quan to watch your back.

09:24.271 --> 09:26.000
- Now hold on.
- That's final.

09:26.206 --> 09:30.768
That's swell, being that most
of my partners end up hurt or dead.

09:30.977 --> 09:33.070
Ask Al how he feels about that.

09:33.280 --> 09:36.875
Well, Quan? Any objections
to working with Callahan?

09:37.083 --> 09:39.176
I think I can handle it.

09:39.986 --> 09:41.544
Get a bulletproof vest, kid.

09:42.489 --> 09:47.290
Teaming Harry with a Chinese-American
will be good for the department image.

09:53.533 --> 09:54.727
You have any kids?

09:54.935 --> 09:56.630
Me? No.

09:56.970 --> 09:58.494
Lucky for them.

11:25.892 --> 11:27.189
Cut. Cut!

11:28.428 --> 11:31.886
You're out of sync, Johnny.
What's the problem here?

11:34.234 --> 11:35.667
Where is that fool?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.063
Jeff!

11:37.404 --> 11:38.371
Jeff!

11:38.571 --> 11:40.163
We've had a short, Peter.

11:40.373 --> 11:42.807
You had all the bugs out.
"Trust me," you said.

11:43.009 --> 11:44.977
- Right? Did he say that?
- "Trust me."

11:45.178 --> 11:47.806
That means "fuck you"
in this business.

11:48.014 --> 11:48.844
I checked it.

11:49.049 --> 11:52.314
I've got a backup head.
Give me 20 minutes and we'll be ready.

11:52.619 --> 11:55.417
All right, do it.
And no cock-ups this time.

11:55.622 --> 11:58.352
And that goes for the rest
of you morons.

12:00.627 --> 12:02.424
This sucks, man.

12:03.196 --> 12:06.029
How can I sing
with shit exploding all over?

12:06.232 --> 12:07.665
It was just an accident.

12:07.867 --> 12:10.131
This whole movie is an accident.

12:10.337 --> 12:12.965
How did I get talked into this shit?

12:13.173 --> 12:16.472
You needed a video.
I needed this sequence for the film.

12:16.676 --> 12:19.110
Stop complaining,
we're getting what we want.

12:19.312 --> 12:24.181
Why couldn't we shoot on a warm
sound stage, instead of a meat locker?

12:24.384 --> 12:28.616
I need it cold so the audience
can see your breath when you sing.

12:28.822 --> 12:29.880
Brilliant.

12:30.090 --> 12:34.254
We won't be original, but people
will know I froze my ass off.

12:34.461 --> 12:35.894
What's that supposed to mean?

12:36.096 --> 12:40.931
A director with talent would have
the guts to shoot something original.

12:41.134 --> 12:44.069
Instead of ripping off old movies
like <i>The Exorcist.</i>

12:44.270 --> 12:48.707
This is not a rip-off,
it's a homage. You stupid...

12:53.313 --> 12:55.144
Jesus, I don't believe you.

12:55.949 --> 12:56.813
What?

12:57.050 --> 12:58.244
You're hurting.

12:59.619 --> 13:01.052
I don't know what you mean.

13:01.254 --> 13:04.121
Don't give me that.
You promised, not during shooting.

13:04.324 --> 13:07.088
I know what I'm doing.

13:07.293 --> 13:08.282
I can handle it.

13:08.495 --> 13:09.928
You won't fuck up my film!

13:10.130 --> 13:11.563
I said, I can handle it!

13:14.834 --> 13:19.430
Just let me go back to the trailer
and get it together.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.340
Then we'll kick some ass.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.100
- OIKK?
- OIKK.

13:24.477 --> 13:25.444
Can I get a Coke?

13:25.645 --> 13:27.875
Get a Coke, please, for Johnny.

13:29.716 --> 13:30.580
Now what?

13:30.784 --> 13:33.275
Don't worry,
Johnny's like a trained seal.

13:33.486 --> 13:35.681
Throw him a fish, he'll perform.

13:59.312 --> 14:01.405
Rise and shine, boys.

14:02.715 --> 14:04.546
Time to get up.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.354
What's happening?

15:38.444 --> 15:41.845
I always knew working Homicide
would be glamorous.

15:42.048 --> 15:44.676
I mean, meeting celebrities and all.

15:45.618 --> 15:48.143
Too bad you can't get his autograph.

15:48.955 --> 15:52.015
You know, Harry,
they always die in threes.

15:52.625 --> 15:56.288
When one celebrity dies, two more
always go in a week or two.

15:57.664 --> 15:59.063
It's a fact, Harry.

15:59.265 --> 16:01.130
Celebrities always die in threes.

16:01.334 --> 16:05.065
Well, this one's got crystalline
powder around his nose and mouth.

16:05.271 --> 16:07.296
Scabs up and down both arms.

16:07.507 --> 16:10.840
Fresh puncture marks
on his left forearm.

16:12.145 --> 16:16.309
Yeah, Homicide can be
really glamorous.

16:39.606 --> 16:41.904
All right,
check the dummy out, please.

16:42.508 --> 16:43.941
Meagan.

16:47.413 --> 16:50.041
I want a three-inch lens, very tight.

16:51.117 --> 16:52.516
Try not to drop it.

16:52.719 --> 16:56.519
Let's hurry up and shoot this
and wrap this up, please.

17:06.366 --> 17:10.097
And my second assistant and I
found Johnny in his trailer.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.299
He was just lying there.

17:12.505 --> 17:14.837
At first we thought it was a joke.

17:15.141 --> 17:18.041
- But then, well...
- When did you last see him alive?

17:18.243 --> 17:20.007
About a half-hour before that.

17:20.213 --> 17:23.114
He went back to his trailer
while we set up.

17:23.316 --> 17:24.407
Was he alone?

17:24.617 --> 17:27.586
I don't know.
But he was alone when we found him.

17:28.320 --> 17:31.017
Tell me, does anyone
on your set use drugs?

17:31.224 --> 17:34.489
We don't do drugs, Callahan.
We do film.

17:36.062 --> 17:38.656
Look, what people do
is their own business.

17:38.865 --> 17:42.961
If it doesn't interfere with my film,
I really don't give a shit.

17:47.874 --> 17:49.671
What about Squares? Was he using?

17:49.876 --> 17:52.003
How should I know?

17:52.211 --> 17:54.111
Johnny had agents, lawyers, friends.

17:54.313 --> 17:57.942
It was their job to deal with his
drug problem, not mine.

17:58.151 --> 18:00.483
Well, that's a very caring attitude.

18:00.887 --> 18:04.516
What do you want, Callahan?
Drugs were Johnny's trademark.

18:04.724 --> 18:07.090
He made his career singing about them.

18:07.293 --> 18:08.885
It made him controversial.

18:09.362 --> 18:12.126
I can see why you'd want him
in your flick.

18:12.331 --> 18:14.026
It was a marketing decision.

18:14.233 --> 18:17.999
Johnny Squares sells tickets.
You know, bums on seats, love.

18:18.204 --> 18:20.468
Besides, we needed
a music video tie-in.

18:20.673 --> 18:22.402
Any idea who was supplying him?

18:24.210 --> 18:28.203
No, but if I hear of anything,
you'll be the first one I call.

18:28.414 --> 18:30.348
Marvelous.

18:36.255 --> 18:39.122
Check on anyone
who dealt with Squares.

18:39.325 --> 18:42.761
- Whether it was the cast or crew...
- Inspector Callahan.

18:43.229 --> 18:44.856
Inspector.

18:45.064 --> 18:46.497
Shit.

18:46.866 --> 18:49.391
Is it true that Johnny Squares OD'd?

18:49.602 --> 18:52.127
We're conducting an investigation.

18:52.338 --> 18:55.432
Right as we speak.
At this point, nothing's been...

18:55.641 --> 18:57.802
Thank you, inspector.

19:01.447 --> 19:03.574
Excuse me, are you Suzanne Dayton?

19:03.783 --> 19:05.114
What's going on here?

19:05.318 --> 19:06.649
Johnny?

19:07.019 --> 19:08.384
Johnny?

19:08.855 --> 19:11.016
Hold it. I'm sorry,
you have to step back.

19:11.224 --> 19:13.488
- No, Johnny!
- There's nothing they can do.

19:17.597 --> 19:19.531
You're gonna make yourself sick.

19:19.732 --> 19:22.667
Hold on, could we
give her a little air?

19:23.636 --> 19:25.035
Out of the way, please.

19:31.310 --> 19:32.777
Off with that camera.

19:32.979 --> 19:35.379
I can film whatever I want.
IKKeep shooting.

19:35.615 --> 19:37.480
This is someone else's heartache.

19:37.683 --> 19:39.150
Right in here.

19:39.352 --> 19:41.877
What are you doing? Give me that.

19:51.531 --> 19:53.021
Smart.

20:57.730 --> 21:01.598
High and Dry <i>is the kind of</i>
<i>mindless film comedy...</i>

21:01.801 --> 21:06.135
<i>... that's come to typify summer films</i>
<i>aimed at the youth market.</i>

21:06.339 --> 21:09.740
<i>The humor is of the</i>
<i>locker-room variety.</i>

21:09.942 --> 21:14.106
<i>Audiences seeking more sophistication</i>
<i>will have to look elsewhere.</i>

21:14.313 --> 21:15.405
<i>The producers...</i>

21:15.715 --> 21:19.242
<i>Rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was found dead this afternoon.</i>

21:19.452 --> 21:22.012
<i>Samantha Walker filed this report.</i>

21:23.189 --> 21:27.592
<i>The body of Johnny Squares was found</i>
<i>today at the Royal Meat Company...</i>

21:27.793 --> 21:30.762
<i>... where he was on location</i>
<i>filming</i> Hotel Satan.

21:30.963 --> 21:36.026
<i>The cause of death is not known,</i>
<i>but Squares had a history of drug use.</i>

21:36.235 --> 21:39.830
<i>The rock star was arrested last July</i>
<i>for possession of heroin.</i>

21:40.039 --> 21:43.805
<i>Many of his songs were allegedly</i>
<i>based on his drug experience.</i>

22:06.899 --> 22:08.389
What's that all about?

22:08.601 --> 22:10.626
My past catching up with me.

22:10.836 --> 22:15.000
As a kid, I was in the gang
that hit him up for protection money.

22:15.408 --> 22:19.242
All my life, I've been running in
gangs or trying to put them away.

22:19.445 --> 22:23.848
So I figured I'd come over to Homicide
for something different.

22:24.050 --> 22:26.018
It's different, all right.

22:30.089 --> 22:31.351
Call for backup.

22:38.831 --> 22:41.459
Come on, get the fuck out of here.
Hurry up!

22:54.580 --> 22:55.672
Move it! Move it!

22:55.881 --> 22:58.315
Put your money on the table!
Hurry up!

22:58.517 --> 22:59.677
Don't move!

22:59.885 --> 23:01.785
Don't fuck with me, lady!

23:02.154 --> 23:03.781
Come on, guys, hurry up!

23:03.990 --> 23:06.151
- You forgot your fortune cookie.
- What!?

23:14.633 --> 23:15.531
It says:

23:17.136 --> 23:18.569
"You're shit out of luck."

23:41.360 --> 23:42.349
Get out of the way!

24:12.224 --> 24:16.661
"Teaming up with a Chinese-American is
good for the department's image."

24:34.447 --> 24:35.471
Who was he?

24:35.681 --> 24:38.479
Some guy in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

24:38.684 --> 24:40.982
Madison. Dean Madison was his name.

24:41.187 --> 24:42.552
Does it ring a bell?

24:43.389 --> 24:46.552
- Never heard of him.
- Well, he knew you, Harry.

24:46.759 --> 24:49.990
I found this in his pocket.
It's a list of celebrities.

24:50.596 --> 24:54.589
Tony Engelhart, the pro linebacker.
Michael Cipriano, the race car driver.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.236
Oh, and one Inspector Harry Callahan.

24:59.738 --> 25:03.731
Johnny Squares is on that list.
See what's written by his name?

25:04.743 --> 25:08.338
Yeah, RIP. "Rest in peace."

25:10.950 --> 25:12.315
You know what this is?

25:12.518 --> 25:14.816
It's a bill for a TV camera and lens.

25:15.020 --> 25:19.081
When I said stop wrecking cars,
I didn't mean destroy something else.

25:19.291 --> 25:21.851
They interfered
with an investigation, sir.

25:22.061 --> 25:25.792
Don't give us that. Is this
your idea of media cooperation?

25:25.998 --> 25:28.193
Cooperation works two ways.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.891
What is it you have against reporters?

25:31.103 --> 25:33.537
Some of them
are just marvelous people.

25:33.739 --> 25:37.732
Others walk through a pile and track
it through an investigation.

25:37.943 --> 25:40.104
You better change
your attitude fast.

25:40.312 --> 25:43.247
Because unless we
reach an agreement with them...

25:43.449 --> 25:47.044
...it's liable to cost this city
2 million, and your career.

25:49.221 --> 25:50.552
Join us, please.

25:50.756 --> 25:53.418
This is Ms. Samantha Walker
of station IKKWSF.

25:53.626 --> 25:54.524
Captain Donnelly.

25:54.727 --> 25:57.958
- Ms. Walker.
- Captain.

25:58.164 --> 26:00.997
- And this is Inspector...
- Callahan. We've met.

26:01.200 --> 26:04.499
Yes, of course. Won't you sit down?

26:06.572 --> 26:07.561
Ms. Walker...

26:07.773 --> 26:11.869
...Lieutenant Ackerman tells me
you have a proposal to make...

26:12.077 --> 26:14.545
...regarding the accidental
damage to...

26:14.747 --> 26:17.409
There was nothing accidental about it.

26:19.351 --> 26:22.218
The department might have something
to say about that.

26:22.421 --> 26:24.889
Although the camera was destroyed...

26:25.090 --> 26:27.957
...I have the entire
incident on video.

26:29.495 --> 26:30.894
I see.

26:34.133 --> 26:35.293
And your proposal?

26:36.535 --> 26:40.164
We may be willing to drop
the lawsuit against the city...

26:40.372 --> 26:42.863
...but that depends
on Inspector Callahan.

26:44.843 --> 26:47.505
I'm sure the inspector
would be willing to...

26:47.713 --> 26:49.203
What do you have in mind?

26:51.784 --> 26:52.773
Dinner.

27:09.535 --> 27:11.901
I owe you an apology.

27:12.204 --> 27:14.638
You were right
about what I did the other day.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.332
I had no business intruding
on that girl's grief.

27:20.246 --> 27:21.804
I get too eager sometimes.

27:22.014 --> 27:25.108
In my rush to get the story,
I made an error in judgement.

27:25.317 --> 27:27.148
We all make those sometimes.

27:27.353 --> 27:29.821
No, I should have known better.

27:30.022 --> 27:31.580
I'm sorry.

27:32.691 --> 27:35.251
- Let me ask you, Miss Walker...
- Sam.

27:35.527 --> 27:36.619
Sam.

27:36.829 --> 27:37.853
Do you like cops?

27:38.931 --> 27:41.365
If they're not in my
rear-view mirror. Why?

27:43.135 --> 27:45.399
I wonder what
we're supposed to talk about...

27:45.604 --> 27:47.970
...other than the damaged camera.

27:48.173 --> 27:49.970
Oh, no, no, no.

27:50.175 --> 27:53.440
I'm letting the insurance company
deal with that.

27:54.580 --> 27:58.380
And I think I can be persuaded
to drop the lawsuit...

27:58.584 --> 28:00.484
...but I want something in return.

28:02.955 --> 28:04.047
What would that be?

28:04.390 --> 28:05.618
I want your story.

28:10.195 --> 28:11.025
What's that?

28:11.230 --> 28:13.664
I've done my homework on you.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.300
You've had quite a colorful career.

28:16.502 --> 28:18.197
Loot at this. You see...

28:18.404 --> 28:22.602
...there's a lot of interest right now
in the Janero case...

28:22.808 --> 28:24.673
...and the cop who put him in prison.

28:24.877 --> 28:29.246
Channel 8 is doing a news special
on organized crime in the Bay Area.

28:29.448 --> 28:33.578
But what I would like to do
is an in-depth profile...

28:33.786 --> 28:36.687
...of you, Inspector Harry Callahan.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.481
Sorry, I'm not interested.

28:38.691 --> 28:42.821
Why not? This latest attempt
on your life by one of Janero's men...

28:43.028 --> 28:45.929
You're not interested
in doing a story on me.

28:46.131 --> 28:48.099
You want blood. That's what sells...

28:48.300 --> 28:51.167
- Now wait a minute...
- No, you wait a minute.

28:51.370 --> 28:53.930
You people are interested
in death and mayhem...

28:54.139 --> 28:56.369
...and you don't care
how you get the story.

28:56.575 --> 29:00.909
That is not fair. That's not
the kind of journalism I do.

29:01.113 --> 29:03.741
To you I'm just a cop
with a price on his head.

29:03.949 --> 29:07.942
Let me tell you, I don't like
people saying they're gonna kill me.

29:08.153 --> 29:11.680
Nor do I like journalists using it
as a way to increase ratings.

29:11.890 --> 29:15.792
- What I was going to say...
- That's the end of the story.

29:32.010 --> 29:33.102
Sorry.

29:35.848 --> 29:38.146
The coroner's report last night...

29:38.650 --> 29:40.743
...said that Squares used speedballs.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.614
Injecting cocaine and heroin?

29:42.821 --> 29:44.345
But that's not what killed him.

29:44.556 --> 29:47.719
He was using an inhaler
with some new designer drug.

29:47.926 --> 29:50.019
A synthetic form of heroin.

29:50.229 --> 29:52.993
You mean something along the lines
of China White.

29:53.198 --> 29:55.996
Only a thousand times wore powerful.

29:56.201 --> 29:59.432
One snort and he went into
immediate respiratory failure.

29:59.638 --> 30:01.333
IKKnow what I'm trying to figure?

30:01.540 --> 30:03.201
Why is a guy like that...

30:03.409 --> 30:07.209
...screwing with synthetic junk
when he's got the real stuff?

30:07.413 --> 30:09.574
Maybe he didn't know
what he was using.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.147
Harry.

30:21.126 --> 30:21.956
Harry?

30:24.563 --> 30:26.224
Sorry about that.

30:29.535 --> 30:31.162
Get you next time.

30:37.709 --> 30:40.837
Check the cast and crew
for prior drug busts.

30:41.046 --> 30:45.813
I'll check with Narcotics to see if any
dealers are moving synthetic heroin.

30:46.118 --> 30:48.382
Harry, there's something here
you should see.

30:49.087 --> 30:52.056
<i>A story to be published</i>
<i>in today's</i> Tribune...

30:52.257 --> 30:56.387
<i>... reveals that director Peter Swan</i>
<i>and several other people involved...</i>

30:56.595 --> 31:01.464
<i>... in the film</i> Hotel Satan <i>were</i>
<i>playing a game called "The Dead Pool."</i>

31:01.667 --> 31:04.192
<i>According to sources,</i>
<i>the object of the game...</i>

31:04.403 --> 31:07.304
<i>... was for players to pick</i>
<i>eight Bay Area celebrities...</i>

31:07.506 --> 31:11.169
<i>... who might die</i>
<i>by a predetermined date.</i>

31:11.376 --> 31:16.177
<i>The winner was to possess the list</i>
<i>with the most dead celebrities.</i>

31:16.381 --> 31:18.508
<i>What makes this story significant...</i>

31:18.717 --> 31:23.711
<i>... is that rock star Johnny Squares</i>
<i>was on director Peter Swan's list.</i>

31:23.922 --> 31:26.720
<i>Although Swan would not comment...</i>

31:26.925 --> 31:30.258
<i>... we have confirmed that</i>
<i>there was such a game...</i>

31:30.462 --> 31:35.024
<i>... and Swan's production accountant,</i>
<i>Dean Madison, was also involved.</i>

31:35.267 --> 31:37.827
<i>Ironically, Madison was</i>
<i>killed yesterday...</i>

31:38.036 --> 31:41.528
<i>... in a tragic holdup attempt</i>
<i>that took place in Chinatown.</i>

31:44.610 --> 31:48.910
"There is no man who is master of the
breath of life so as to retain it...

31:49.114 --> 31:52.106
...and none has mastery
over the day of death.

31:52.317 --> 31:55.150
For the Lord of all
shows no partiality...

31:55.354 --> 31:56.912
...nor does He fear greatness...

31:57.122 --> 31:58.987
...because He himself
made the great...

31:59.191 --> 32:00.715
...as well as the small.

32:00.926 --> 32:03.724
And He provides for all alike.

32:04.496 --> 32:08.057
And the dust returns to the
earth, as it once was.

32:08.500 --> 32:12.095
And the life breath
returns to God, who gaveth."

32:19.478 --> 32:21.207
My condolences.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.440
Mrs. Dayton, I'm terribly sorry.

32:24.683 --> 32:27.675
Suzanne, I'm very sorry
for your trouble.

32:27.886 --> 32:29.183
Thank you.

32:30.989 --> 32:32.479
My sympathies, dear.

32:35.027 --> 32:38.656
Do you mind, gentlemen?
I happen to be at a funeral.

32:38.897 --> 32:40.831
I'd like to talk about your list.

32:41.033 --> 32:44.491
It's no big secret.
The cast and crew knew about it.

32:44.703 --> 32:47.900
The Dead Pool is just a harmless game.

32:48.106 --> 32:50.472
It sounds pretty sick to me.

32:51.043 --> 32:52.533
Let me tell you something.

32:52.911 --> 32:55.846
People are fascinated
with death and violence.

32:56.048 --> 32:57.948
That's why my films make money.

32:58.150 --> 33:01.449
They're an escape,
a vicarious release of fear.

33:01.653 --> 33:03.484
Same thing with this game.

33:03.689 --> 33:06.385
Nobody takes my films
or the Dead Pool seriously.

33:07.092 --> 33:10.619
Someone gave Squares the drugs
that killed him. Maybe you.

33:10.829 --> 33:14.287
You can't tie me to Johnny's death
because of a coincidence.

33:15.734 --> 33:20.000
My assistant and effects supervisor
played too. Why not talk to them?

33:20.205 --> 33:21.172
We will.

33:22.140 --> 33:24.233
But nobody on their list is dead yet.

33:24.443 --> 33:28.937
Johnny was a drug user and I predicted
he'd die this year. That's all.

33:29.147 --> 33:32.241
The idea is to pick celebrities
who won't make it...

33:32.451 --> 33:35.477
...because they're old, sick
or in a high-risk profession.

33:35.687 --> 33:37.177
Like police work?

33:37.656 --> 33:38.623
Nothing personal.

33:38.824 --> 33:41.384
I don't like being on your list, Swan.

33:41.593 --> 33:44.323
That's what this is really about,
isn't it?

33:44.529 --> 33:45.689
If you have a choice...

33:45.897 --> 33:48.593
Maybe I'll start my own Pool
and put you on it.

33:48.800 --> 33:50.233
Are you threatening me?

33:50.869 --> 33:55.272
If you want to play the game,
you'd better know the rules, love.

34:14.059 --> 34:16.186
That's our report. I'm Patrick Snow.

34:16.395 --> 34:19.262
I'm Samantha Walker.
Thank you for being with us.

34:19.464 --> 34:21.431
Tune in tonight
for an exclusive report...

34:21.632 --> 34:24.033
...on chemical dependency
among celebrities.

34:24.235 --> 34:25.862
Who they are, why they do it...

34:26.071 --> 34:28.699
...and the price they pay.
Tonight at 11.

34:28.907 --> 34:30.204
Good night.

34:31.143 --> 34:32.770
And we're clear.

34:51.596 --> 34:53.860
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

34:54.065 --> 34:55.590
I saw your report yesterday.

34:55.801 --> 34:57.928
We confirmed it
with people in the game.

34:58.136 --> 35:02.903
Vicky Owens, Swan's assistant,
and effects supervisor, Jeff Howser.

35:03.241 --> 35:06.074
It didn't occur to you
to clear it with us first?

35:06.278 --> 35:07.836
I had to go with the story.

35:08.046 --> 35:11.573
The papers got the same tip.
I had to get the story out fast.

35:11.783 --> 35:13.978
Or someone else would get it first?

35:14.186 --> 35:16.416
- Something like that.
- How were you tipped?

35:16.621 --> 35:20.580
By mail. A copy of the Dead Pool
and a letter explaining it.

35:23.161 --> 35:25.493
- It's already started.
- What has?

35:25.697 --> 35:27.722
All the media bullshit.

35:27.966 --> 35:31.993
Newspapers print the Dead Pool
and it hurts our investigation.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.762
What bothers you...

35:33.972 --> 35:36.702
...is that we found out about
the Dead Pool first.

35:36.908 --> 35:41.277
You people take Janero and the Dead
Pool, add hype and distortion...

35:41.480 --> 35:43.107
...and innocent people get hurt.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.283
Aren't you overreacting?

35:45.484 --> 35:46.917
I've seen it happen.

35:47.119 --> 35:49.952
I don't like the hype, either...

35:50.155 --> 35:52.487
...but it happens when reporters
compete for a story.

35:52.858 --> 35:56.851
Why don't you start thinking about
your responsibility to the public?

35:58.363 --> 36:01.298
You can't kill the messenger
because of the message.

36:02.868 --> 36:07.202
I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention
to screw up your investigation.

36:08.106 --> 36:10.370
Here's the list. Now, excuse me.

36:12.911 --> 36:14.105
Thanks.

36:17.883 --> 36:19.407
It seems I owe you one.

36:22.420 --> 36:23.910
Dinner, that is.

36:27.092 --> 36:31.859
I was offered a job as an anchor
at this small, local station.

36:32.063 --> 36:33.496
Because...

36:33.765 --> 36:36.962
...I was first runner-up
in Miss Colorado.

36:37.169 --> 36:39.763
Colorado? We're right over here.

36:39.971 --> 36:44.374
But I had absolutely no experience,
just my bachelor's in journalism.

36:44.576 --> 36:48.444
But it was a way in, so I grabbed it.

36:51.583 --> 36:54.552
But I didn't just smile at
the camera and read copy.

36:54.753 --> 36:57.381
I did anything and everything
at this station.

36:57.589 --> 37:01.650
Sports, news, hard news, weather.

37:01.860 --> 37:03.794
I produced documentaries.

37:05.630 --> 37:07.564
I love San Francisco.

37:07.766 --> 37:09.393
But it isn't easy.

37:10.769 --> 37:12.930
Big city, big news.

37:13.839 --> 37:16.205
I had to prove myself all over again.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.069
Have you succeeded?

37:18.443 --> 37:19.671
Somewhat.

37:21.012 --> 37:22.445
Apparently not with you.

37:23.715 --> 37:28.084
I shouldn't complain. At least you
stayed for dinner this time.

37:29.888 --> 37:32.049
I'd still love to do your story.

37:32.624 --> 37:33.886
No, thanks.

37:34.159 --> 37:37.458
You're wrong about me, Callahan,
and what I want to do.

37:38.230 --> 37:40.164
I wish I could convince you.

37:40.599 --> 37:41.998
I'll tell you what.

37:42.601 --> 37:44.228
Let's think on it.

37:45.337 --> 37:46.235
Sounds fair.

37:48.974 --> 37:50.202
Thank you.

38:04.823 --> 38:08.088
It's the truth,
I don't care what you say.

38:15.066 --> 38:16.693
Hey, Callahan.

38:17.068 --> 38:19.628
- You're Callahan, aren't you?
- That's right.

38:19.838 --> 38:20.930
What can I do for you?

38:21.139 --> 38:23.539
You're the cop who put Janero away.

38:26.578 --> 38:29.138
All I want is your autograph.

38:30.916 --> 38:32.747
Can I shake your hand?

38:36.354 --> 38:37.821
I'd just like to thank you.

38:38.023 --> 38:41.322
It's about time somebody
did something about Janero.

38:41.526 --> 38:45.292
Could you sign it to
Chester Docksteder? That's me.

38:46.398 --> 38:47.797
Let me buy you a drink.

38:47.999 --> 38:49.466
Some other time.

38:50.068 --> 38:53.731
We need more cops like you.
That's what we need.

38:54.339 --> 38:56.500
I gotta change my shorts.

39:00.245 --> 39:01.974
What are you laughing at?

39:02.180 --> 39:04.910
This is your 15 minutes, Callahan.

39:05.450 --> 39:09.910
Andy Warhol said everybody's famous
for 15 minutes. Well, this is it.

39:10.121 --> 39:11.145
Swell.

39:27.005 --> 39:28.529
Was it your first autograph?

39:28.740 --> 39:29.900
Yeah.

39:30.175 --> 39:32.336
And I hope my last.

40:59.130 --> 41:00.859
You know something?

41:01.132 --> 41:04.067
I don't think Lou Janero
likes you very much.

41:15.980 --> 41:18.710
She's okay. Just a little shaken up.

41:24.889 --> 41:26.550
How're you doing, girl?

41:30.261 --> 41:34.027
Whatever they're paying you, Harry,
it couldn't be enough.

41:38.603 --> 41:40.127
My colleagues.

41:45.243 --> 41:47.143
I don't want to be the news.

41:48.813 --> 41:50.405
Let's get you out of here.

42:23.548 --> 42:25.516
You sure you want to see this guy?

42:25.717 --> 42:26.979
Yeah.

42:37.762 --> 42:39.059
Here's your animal.

42:39.597 --> 42:40.427
Hicks.

42:40.632 --> 42:42.259
What the fuck do you want?

42:42.467 --> 42:44.526
I brought you some cigarettes.

42:45.136 --> 42:47.366
And what would I have to do for you?

42:47.639 --> 42:50.608
Nothing. Just stand where I tell you.

43:17.168 --> 43:18.499
Stay right here.

43:18.703 --> 43:20.170
Fifth cell down.

43:29.280 --> 43:33.273
That's the trouble with this prison.
They let anybody in.

43:33.718 --> 43:36.778
I don't like scum like you
trying to kill me.

43:38.056 --> 43:42.891
Sounds to me like this Dead Pool thing
is making you a little paranoid.

43:44.462 --> 43:47.158
Oh, yeah. I heard about it.

43:47.398 --> 43:50.060
Good news travels fast.

43:50.268 --> 43:52.634
Big fucking media hero.

43:52.837 --> 43:55.362
Hero today and gone tomorrow.

43:55.640 --> 43:57.608
Call off your guns.

43:57.842 --> 43:59.503
What are you talking about?

43:59.711 --> 44:03.738
Your trouble is, you have
too much time on your hands.

44:03.948 --> 44:05.438
What you need is a job.

44:05.650 --> 44:06.480
A what?

44:06.684 --> 44:07.981
A job.

44:08.486 --> 44:11.819
I'm gonna give you a job
being a postman, understand?

44:12.023 --> 44:14.685
It'll be your job to see
the mail gets through.

44:15.727 --> 44:17.854
See that gorilla down there?

44:26.537 --> 44:30.667
That's Butcher Hicks, and he's killed
three men. You know how?

44:30.875 --> 44:34.333
He tore them apart with his teeth.
Never found all the pieces.

44:34.545 --> 44:36.809
He has an unhealthy appetite.

44:37.015 --> 44:38.209
So what?

44:38.416 --> 44:41.010
So Hicks there is my new pen pal.

44:41.219 --> 44:43.278
I'll write him once a week...

44:43.488 --> 44:46.355
...about how I'm looking in
on his sick mother...

44:46.557 --> 44:49.549
...and trying to get him
special privileges here.

44:49.894 --> 44:54.524
And the interesting part is,
if anything happens to me...

44:54.732 --> 44:56.461
...and Hicks doesn't get his letter...

44:56.668 --> 44:59.728
...he'll be really pissed off.
And he'll come to see you...

44:59.937 --> 45:01.234
...because you're the mailman.

45:02.840 --> 45:07.743
He'll probably come down here
and cancel your ass like a stamp.

45:10.448 --> 45:13.383
You better ensure prompt,
courteous delivery.

45:13.584 --> 45:16.610
And pray nothing happens to me.

45:21.359 --> 45:23.088
- That's it?
- That's it.

45:23.294 --> 45:26.422
See that dirtbag
I was talking to down there?

45:29.033 --> 45:31.058
He says smoking can cause cancer...

45:31.269 --> 45:35.638
...and anyone who smokes as much
as you do is one dumb son of a bitch.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.157
Fire!

45:58.963 --> 45:59.861
Cut!

46:00.064 --> 46:02.498
Cut! Cut.

46:04.168 --> 46:06.568
Where is that stupid fuck? Hauser!

46:07.739 --> 46:09.604
Get your ass down here.

46:11.976 --> 46:15.309
You're supposed to harpoon
the goddamn dummy.

46:16.581 --> 46:17.707
The tide shifted.

46:17.915 --> 46:21.510
"The tide shifted."
The ocean's incompetent, not you.

46:21.719 --> 46:23.846
This is the third time this week.

46:24.055 --> 46:26.046
You'll never work for me again.

46:26.257 --> 46:28.691
There's a bunch
of reporters down there.

46:31.662 --> 46:33.186
Come on, come on.

46:38.603 --> 46:40.298
Can we ask you a few questions?

46:40.505 --> 46:41.836
Please!

46:42.039 --> 46:43.870
I'd like to say one thing.

46:44.075 --> 46:45.975
In light of what's happened...

46:46.177 --> 46:48.975
...perhaps playing the Dead Pool game
isn't smart.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.944
Any tie between the Dead Pool
and Squares' death?

46:52.150 --> 46:54.550
None whatsoever. Next question.

46:54.752 --> 46:56.811
Mr. Swan, will the game continue?

46:57.021 --> 47:00.718
No, we're filming a nightmare
sequence at the shipyards...

47:00.925 --> 47:04.088
...and we'd like to forget this
and get on with our job.

47:04.395 --> 47:06.363
Johnny would have wanted it that way.

47:06.564 --> 47:11.433
First Squares died, then your
production accountant was killed.

47:11.636 --> 47:13.399
Is <i>Hotel Satan</i> cursed?

47:13.604 --> 47:16.767
People can believe what they want,
but nothing...

47:18.643 --> 47:21.544
Nothing will stop me
from making this film.

47:23.648 --> 47:25.081
End of interview.

48:09.393 --> 48:13.159
Whatever you want,
money, credit cards, just take it.

48:13.364 --> 48:16.390
Ever notice how time
slows down at night?

48:16.601 --> 48:20.264
Just like in my films. A dream world.

48:20.471 --> 48:21.597
Shut up!

48:22.340 --> 48:24.774
I can't hear the colors.
I've got to hear them.

48:25.343 --> 48:29.746
That's the mark of a good director,
you have to hear the colors.

48:29.947 --> 48:32.882
You've gotta be able
to taste the sounds.

48:33.084 --> 48:34.449
I have a heart condition.

48:34.652 --> 48:36.483
A critic with a heart.

48:36.787 --> 48:38.049
That's a laugh.

48:40.124 --> 48:41.716
Do you like my films?

48:41.926 --> 48:45.623
- I said, do you like my films?
- Who are you?

48:50.868 --> 48:54.235
- You know who I am.
- I don't. I don't know you.

48:54.438 --> 48:55.735
God...

48:56.140 --> 48:59.109
...what kind of a film critic are you?

48:59.977 --> 49:01.842
<i>Shadows of the Dead</i>!

49:03.548 --> 49:05.277
<i>Hell Without the Devil</i>!

49:05.516 --> 49:07.541
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>!

49:09.120 --> 49:11.350
Peter Swan.

49:12.757 --> 49:14.247
Brilliant, love.

49:15.426 --> 49:17.417
What do you think of my films?

49:17.995 --> 49:21.431
Give me your honest opinion.

49:22.567 --> 49:24.467
I like them.

49:24.669 --> 49:25.795
Liar!

49:35.046 --> 49:37.810
The entrance is probably
through the sliding glass door.

49:38.015 --> 49:40.040
She wasn't sexually assaulted.

49:40.251 --> 49:41.809
IKKilled sometime last night.

49:42.019 --> 49:45.045
Maid found her this morning.
Do you recognize her?

49:45.590 --> 49:48.150
Molly Fisher. Famous movie critic.

49:48.359 --> 49:50.827
On a scale of 1 to 10,
10 being the best...

49:51.028 --> 49:53.292
...I'd have to rate this one an 8.

49:53.497 --> 49:55.465
Harry, we found this.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.428
Thanks.

49:59.303 --> 50:00.463
Dead Pool.

50:00.738 --> 50:03.536
Molly Fisher's also
on Peter Swan's list.

50:41.045 --> 50:42.876
<i>Oh, God, it's coming!</i>

50:44.749 --> 50:49.049
Those are just some of the highlights
of Peter Swan's films.

50:50.154 --> 50:54.284
The typeface is the same as those sent
to the papers and TV stations.

50:54.492 --> 50:58.986
And the neighbor saw a man exiting
Molly Fisher's condo last night.

50:59.196 --> 51:01.721
Mid-30s, wearing a black jacket.

51:01.999 --> 51:03.864
I want Swan in custody now.

51:04.068 --> 51:05.467
It doesn't feel right.

51:05.670 --> 51:06.864
Doesn't feel right?

51:07.371 --> 51:10.898
Every celebrity on this list has
called in the last couple days.

51:11.108 --> 51:13.668
They're all screaming
for police protection.

51:13.878 --> 51:17.939
We don't have the manpower
to be 24-hour babysitters.

51:18.149 --> 51:23.109
Ackerman is whining about the negative
publicity this case is giving us.

51:23.320 --> 51:26.448
And your name
is on this list too, Callahan.

51:28.159 --> 51:31.890
My gut feeling tells me Swan is the
best suspect we have...

51:32.096 --> 51:33.654
...so get his butt in here!

51:36.000 --> 51:37.160
Donnelly.

51:37.468 --> 51:38.492
What?

51:40.204 --> 51:42.638
It's for you, Callahan.

51:47.878 --> 51:49.641
We'll be right there.

51:50.014 --> 51:52.642
Wait a minute. Where are you going?

51:52.917 --> 51:55.909
To do my job.
I think we've got our man.

51:58.422 --> 52:00.049
You all stay back.

52:00.925 --> 52:02.187
Everyone.

52:02.893 --> 52:03.985
I'm gonna go up.

52:05.329 --> 52:07.297
Where's the news crew?

52:09.366 --> 52:11.391
You better get them here.

52:13.037 --> 52:14.527
I mean it. Now!

52:20.678 --> 52:21.508
What's up?

52:21.712 --> 52:25.978
Name's Gus Wheeler.
He says he's the Dead Pool killer.

52:26.183 --> 52:27.844
We found him like this.

52:28.052 --> 52:31.954
He's soaked in gas and threatening
to set himself on fire.

52:32.156 --> 52:33.589
Why not hose him down?

52:33.791 --> 52:37.955
He says if he sees a fireman or even
a garden hose, he'll torch himself.

52:38.763 --> 52:39.627
What's he want?

52:39.830 --> 52:41.491
To be on television.

52:41.832 --> 52:44.426
He wants a cameraman and a reporter.

52:44.635 --> 52:46.262
Al and I will just pose as...

52:46.470 --> 52:49.303
It has to be someone he recognizes.

53:01.185 --> 53:03.710
Stay back. Stay back from me.

53:04.588 --> 53:06.385
It's gonna go up. You hear me?

53:07.024 --> 53:08.889
Better keep those people back.

53:10.461 --> 53:12.395
- You all right?
- Not really.

53:12.596 --> 53:15.360
Stop right there! That's far enough.

53:16.267 --> 53:18.428
I'm Samantha Walker from...

53:18.636 --> 53:21.332
- I know who you are!
- What do you want?

53:23.407 --> 53:24.499
Is that camera on?

53:27.178 --> 53:29.408
You want to know why I'm doing this?

53:31.582 --> 53:33.174
Because nobody cares.

53:33.384 --> 53:34.373
We care, Mr. Wheeler...

53:34.585 --> 53:37.748
No! Nobody ever paid
any attention to me before.

53:38.022 --> 53:41.458
In order to get attention,
you gotta do something.

53:42.726 --> 53:46.594
Well, I'm really gonna
do something this time!

53:47.064 --> 53:50.124
Did you have anything
to do with the deaths...

53:50.334 --> 53:52.529
...of Johnny Squares and Molly Fisher?

53:52.736 --> 53:55.296
No, I just said that so you'd listen!

53:58.108 --> 54:00.599
I want everyone to see this!

54:01.145 --> 54:03.545
I want everyone to remember me!

54:03.814 --> 54:06.408
And to remember what I did here!

54:13.524 --> 54:17.085
Oh, Jesus, Harry, he's
really gonna do it.

54:17.294 --> 54:21.663
That's right, lady. I'm really
gonna set myself on fire.

54:22.399 --> 54:24.663
And it's gonna be on the news...

54:25.069 --> 54:28.527
...and then finally everybody
will know about me.

54:28.739 --> 54:31.173
About me! Gus Wheeler!

54:33.777 --> 54:35.938
No one's going to see you die.

54:38.382 --> 54:39.212
What?

54:39.416 --> 54:42.146
I said, no one's gonna see you die.

54:42.519 --> 54:44.453
Not if we stop filming.

54:48.325 --> 54:51.021
You can talk to me
and tell me your story...

54:51.228 --> 54:53.128
...but we won't film your suicide.

54:59.737 --> 55:00.567
What are you doing?

55:00.838 --> 55:03.636
- Turn the camera back on!
- We're not gonna film it!

55:03.841 --> 55:06.275
- We're not.
- She's right.

55:06.477 --> 55:10.436
You can set yourself on fire
and we'll roast marshmallows.

55:10.648 --> 55:12.513
But you won't be on <i>News at 11.</i>

55:13.384 --> 55:15.443
You're ruining everything.

55:16.186 --> 55:17.551
Give me the flare.

55:17.788 --> 55:19.517
You've got plenty of coverage.

55:22.726 --> 55:23.784
You think so?

55:24.461 --> 55:25.450
Trust me.

55:34.204 --> 55:35.193
Okay.

55:51.255 --> 55:52.654
Harry, you okay?

55:54.358 --> 55:56.292
- You hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

56:00.764 --> 56:02.664
Get that gurney over here, quick!

56:05.736 --> 56:06.566
You all right?

56:06.770 --> 56:09.136
Oh, God, Harry.

56:10.207 --> 56:13.540
This man sets himself on fire.

56:18.349 --> 56:19.373
And it's my fault.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.346
It was an accident.

56:23.620 --> 56:25.349
Maybe if we'd have kept filming.

56:25.556 --> 56:27.683
That's exactly what he wanted.

56:28.726 --> 56:33.493
What you did took guts. Most people
would have gone for the exclusive.

56:39.703 --> 56:41.500
Reel three, George.

56:45.009 --> 56:46.442
Just a moment.

56:46.910 --> 56:50.346
What is this? Why the fuck
are you harassing me?

56:50.547 --> 56:52.674
I was at a party when
Fisher was killed.

56:52.883 --> 56:55.909
I was there until 2,
and I have witnesses.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.610
We know that. We checked.

56:57.821 --> 57:03.020
Somebody's trying to make us think
that you killed Squares and Fisher.

57:04.962 --> 57:06.361
Any idea who it is?

57:06.563 --> 57:08.963
Are you kidding? It could be anyone.

57:09.566 --> 57:10.590
They all hate me.

57:10.801 --> 57:11.893
My former agent.

57:12.102 --> 57:15.435
My producers, my crew. The public.

57:15.639 --> 57:20.008
They envy my talent so much
they wish to destroy it.

57:22.579 --> 57:25.446
You don't believe me?
Talk to my secretary.

57:25.649 --> 57:29.710
She'll show you the letters I get.
Warnings, death threats...

57:29.920 --> 57:33.014
I get so many,
I don't pay attention anymore.

57:33.524 --> 57:35.014
I'll check on it.

57:35.692 --> 57:37.159
Tell me...

57:37.628 --> 57:40.597
...anyone else have
a jacket like this?

57:40.798 --> 57:41.992
Most of my crew. Why?

57:42.199 --> 57:46.659
Maybe it was someone in your crew,
or who's worked for you in the past.

57:46.870 --> 57:51.364
Whoever's doing these murders uses
your films and you as inspiration.

57:53.644 --> 57:57.444
<i>Welcome to the</i> Nolan IKKennard Show.
<i>Sex, violence, pornography:</i>

57:57.648 --> 58:02.017
<i>I say it's out of hand. It's time</i>
<i>we have guidelines for what we watch.</i>

58:03.720 --> 58:07.986
<i>I don't want Big Brother out there</i>
<i>telling me what to read or watch.</i>

58:11.228 --> 58:12.195
<i>What's your opinion?</i>

58:12.396 --> 58:15.024
<i>Anybody can watch anything...</i>

58:15.232 --> 58:18.065
<i>... as long as it doesn't</i>
<i>hurt somebody else.</i>

58:20.370 --> 58:22.065
<i>Take it easy.</i>

58:22.272 --> 58:24.206
<i>Give me a chance here.</i>

58:24.408 --> 58:26.842
<i>Who decides what's harmful?</i>

58:27.044 --> 58:29.308
<i>Isn't that what we're talking about?</i>

59:56.833 --> 01:00:00.894
First Johnny Squares, then Molly
Fisher, now Nolan IKKennard.

01:00:01.104 --> 01:00:05.598
- Like I said, celebrities always die...
- In threes, yeah.

01:00:06.843 --> 01:00:10.335
- At least the guy went out with a...
- A bang, I know.

01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:15.613
- What do you have, Russ?
- Hello, Harry.

01:00:15.819 --> 01:00:20.620
From the residue on the frags,
I'd say plastic. Probably C3 or 4.

01:00:20.824 --> 01:00:22.883
We'll do an analysis back at the lab.

01:00:23.093 --> 01:00:25.618
- Let me know the results.
- You got it.

01:00:32.236 --> 01:00:33.703
What's that?

01:00:33.904 --> 01:00:35.428
I don't know.

01:00:35.872 --> 01:00:38.568
It looks like the wheel from a toy.

01:00:46.116 --> 01:00:48.516
Have you been questioned about
Nolan IKKennard?

01:00:48.719 --> 01:00:51.085
Is his death connected
to the Dead Pool?

01:00:51.288 --> 01:00:53.449
- I don't know.
- Is his death due to your list?

01:00:53.657 --> 01:00:55.716
- I don't know.
- In <i>Hell Without the Devil...</i>

01:00:55.926 --> 01:00:57.018
...a character's poisoned.

01:00:57.227 --> 01:00:59.923
<i>Night of the Slasher</i>
has several stabbings.

01:01:00.130 --> 01:01:02.928
- We can guess what <i>Hotel Satan</i>...
- Get to the point.

01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:06.432
Are there parallels between the deaths
in your film...

01:01:06.637 --> 01:01:08.502
...and the death of Johnny Squares?

01:01:08.705 --> 01:01:10.673
That's a stupid question!

01:01:10.874 --> 01:01:12.808
Do you feel any responsibility?

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.604
You people are
blowing this out of proportion.

01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:19.145
<i>You want to speak to somebody?</i>
<i>Speak to the police.</i>

01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:23.513
<i>Talk to Inspector Callahan.</i>
<i>He'll tell you I'm not a suspect.</i>

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:25.847
<i>I have nothing</i>
<i>to do with these deaths.</i>

01:01:26.056 --> 01:01:28.422
<i>That's all I have to say, now sod off.</i>

01:01:28.825 --> 01:01:30.486
Callahan!

01:02:07.097 --> 01:02:08.564
You.

01:02:43.133 --> 01:02:44.259
Harry.

01:02:47.037 --> 01:02:49.232
I think that's about it for me.

01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:54.405
What's that tattoo?

01:02:55.078 --> 01:02:56.705
Oh, that.

01:02:56.913 --> 01:02:59.211
One of my grandfather's superstitions.

01:02:59.416 --> 01:03:03.079
You see, he painted these words
on my back and chest.

01:03:03.286 --> 01:03:06.915
It's supposed to ward off
anything that's harmful or evil.

01:03:07.124 --> 01:03:11.458
When he heard I was your partner,
he figured I could use the help.

01:03:11.661 --> 01:03:13.891
I was just trying
to honor the old guy.

01:03:14.631 --> 01:03:17.429
Besides, I didn't think it could hurt.

01:03:18.168 --> 01:03:20.636
Listen, I think I'm gonna go home.

01:03:20.837 --> 01:03:23.203
I'll catch you later for a beer.

01:03:59.976 --> 01:04:01.876
- See him?
- I saw him.

01:04:40.517 --> 01:04:42.075
He can't be over there.

01:04:42.652 --> 01:04:44.176
How y'all doing?

01:05:00.437 --> 01:05:02.530
You're the last asshole Janero sends.

01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:04.070
Wait, you got it wrong!

01:05:04.274 --> 01:05:07.607
Don't fuck with me, buddy.
I'll kick your ass right now.

01:05:07.811 --> 01:05:09.039
It's not what you think.

01:05:09.246 --> 01:05:11.214
Janero did hire us.

01:05:11.414 --> 01:05:13.279
But this ain't a hit.

01:05:13.483 --> 01:05:17.146
Janero doesn't want
anything to happen to you.

01:05:17.354 --> 01:05:18.286
We're your...

01:05:19.189 --> 01:05:20.281
...bodyguards.

01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:33.865
Those letters
all came from your files.

01:05:34.271 --> 01:05:36.796
Harlan Rook. God.

01:05:37.007 --> 01:05:38.372
Yes, I remember him.

01:05:38.575 --> 01:05:43.069
Every time I was at a film festival
or a seminar, he was there.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:47.512
Mr. IKKnow-It-AII, I called him.
He knew everything about my films.

01:05:49.019 --> 01:05:52.455
To tell the truth,
I found it a little unnerving.

01:05:53.323 --> 01:05:54.813
What'd he want?

01:05:55.625 --> 01:05:56.922
He had this screenplay...

01:05:57.127 --> 01:05:59.322
...for a horror film
he wanted me to direct.

01:05:59.529 --> 01:06:02.225
He said it'd be
the ultimate Peter Swan film.

01:06:02.432 --> 01:06:04.400
He was crazy.
I couldn't get rid of him.

01:06:04.601 --> 01:06:08.093
Finally, my attorney
put a restraining order on him.

01:06:08.305 --> 01:06:09.499
Then what happened?

01:06:09.706 --> 01:06:11.799
I didn't see or hear from him again.

01:06:12.008 --> 01:06:14.875
That must have been over a year ago.

01:06:16.313 --> 01:06:17.280
Is he the one?

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.710
The typewriter
used on these letters...

01:06:19.916 --> 01:06:23.443
...is the same one used
to tip us off to the Dead Pool.

01:06:28.058 --> 01:06:31.357
Call Swan's attorney
and see what he knows about Rook.

01:06:31.561 --> 01:06:33.358
And run a DMV check.

01:06:33.563 --> 01:06:34.689
Right.

01:07:02.492 --> 01:07:06.758
It might not be a bad idea to start
playing it a little safe.

01:07:06.963 --> 01:07:09.158
Maybe your granddaddy can paint me up.

01:07:09.366 --> 01:07:11.231
Look, I'm being serious.

01:07:11.434 --> 01:07:15.370
Don't go where you normally go,
not even home. You can stay with me.

01:07:15.839 --> 01:07:19.002
Thanks, but I think I can
do a little better.

01:07:29.886 --> 01:07:31.410
Price of fame.

01:08:01.651 --> 01:08:05.178
Is this what Ackerman meant
by cooperating with the press?

01:08:05.388 --> 01:08:08.789
It must have been one of those
in-depth interviews.

01:08:19.703 --> 01:08:22.866
I got a lead on Rook.
A psychiatrist who treated him.

01:08:23.073 --> 01:08:24.301
Good.

01:08:27.377 --> 01:08:28.469
- Give it a try.
- Okay.

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:36.910
It won't respond.
Someone's on my frequency.

01:08:50.066 --> 01:08:52.626
Forget it. It's just not working.

01:09:23.133 --> 01:09:24.997
Now what the hell is that?

01:12:43.967 --> 01:12:46.026
Time's up, Callahan.

01:13:23.473 --> 01:13:25.031
You all right, Al?

01:13:25.408 --> 01:13:26.932
Shit.

01:13:39.989 --> 01:13:41.581
Two fractured ribs.

01:13:42.125 --> 01:13:45.117
He bled in the chest.
We drained it and set up an IV.

01:13:45.328 --> 01:13:49.094
He's lucky, the bulletproof vest
he had on saved his life.

01:13:49.966 --> 01:13:52.560
Another of my
grandfather's superstitions.

01:13:52.769 --> 01:13:54.828
When your partner gives you advice...

01:13:55.038 --> 01:13:56.005
...take it.

01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:58.707
Harry.

01:14:07.283 --> 01:14:11.117
This is Dr. Friedman, chief
psychiatrist here at the hospital.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.981
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:14.986
I feel somewhat responsible.

01:14:15.191 --> 01:14:18.319
Your partner contacted me about
a former patient of ours.

01:14:18.528 --> 01:14:20.052
- Harlan Rook?
- Yes.

01:14:20.263 --> 01:14:23.926
At first, I didn't recall the name.
I found the file today.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.793
He was evaluated here a year ago.

01:14:27.003 --> 01:14:29.471
The diagnosis was
process schizophrenia.

01:14:29.672 --> 01:14:31.105
Multiple personality.

01:14:31.307 --> 01:14:32.137
Exactly.

01:14:32.809 --> 01:14:34.777
His sense of self-hate
was so strong...

01:14:34.977 --> 01:14:38.071
...that he no longer had
any personality of his own.

01:14:38.281 --> 01:14:41.739
Consequently,
he substituted identities...

01:14:41.951 --> 01:14:44.419
...found in books, films...

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:46.053
...fan magazines.

01:14:46.255 --> 01:14:49.281
Identities with which he had
love-hate relationships.

01:14:49.492 --> 01:14:51.858
He wasn't dangerous enough to hold?

01:14:52.061 --> 01:14:55.462
Most mentally ill people
are not violent, inspector.

01:14:55.665 --> 01:15:00.329
By law, a person who poses no danger
can only be held for 72 hours.

01:15:01.370 --> 01:15:05.170
I'm sorry, this is one instance
where the system failed.

01:15:05.374 --> 01:15:07.137
Is this address recent?

01:15:07.343 --> 01:15:08.776
I assume it's still the same.

01:15:12.882 --> 01:15:14.076
Samantha Walker.

01:15:14.283 --> 01:15:16.342
<i>This is Peter Swan, Ms. Walker.</i>

01:15:16.552 --> 01:15:19.385
<i>Your coverage of my predicament</i>
<i>has been thorough...</i>

01:15:19.589 --> 01:15:23.081
<i>... but my side hasn't been told</i>
<i>as well as it could be.</i>

01:15:23.292 --> 01:15:24.554
I see.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.888
<i>I'm prepared to grant you</i>
<i>an exclusive interview.</i>

01:15:28.097 --> 01:15:29.997
<i>Are you interested?</i>

01:15:34.904 --> 01:15:36.371
No doubt about it.

01:15:36.572 --> 01:15:37.903
He's our boy, Harry.

01:15:38.107 --> 01:15:41.235
Explosives. Caps.

01:15:41.444 --> 01:15:42.570
Detonator.

01:15:42.778 --> 01:15:43.836
It all connects.

01:15:44.413 --> 01:15:46.381
Harry, you gotta see this.

01:15:51.254 --> 01:15:52.915
Talk about obsession.

01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:13.302
Looks like he had a real
Peter Swan shrine going here.

01:16:16.078 --> 01:16:17.943
I'm not sure.

01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:20.547
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.809
But I'm not sure.

01:16:23.019 --> 01:16:26.546
- Bob, do you have my little mike?
- It's in your bag.

01:16:26.756 --> 01:16:28.155
Thank you.

01:17:06.729 --> 01:17:07.889
Look at this.

01:17:10.933 --> 01:17:13.094
I'll call the TV station.

01:17:25.314 --> 01:17:29.216
Samantha went out to the shipyard
to interview Peter Swan.

01:17:29.418 --> 01:17:31.511
Swan doesn't know anything about it.

01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:33.951
- What's this?
- A payroll stub.

01:17:34.156 --> 01:17:37.455
Sundown Security, made out to
Ed Butler? I don't get it.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:41.391
That's the company that provides
security for Swan's locations.

01:17:41.597 --> 01:17:44.293
Ed Butler may be an alias for Rook.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.627
Where are you going? Harry?

01:17:46.836 --> 01:17:48.565
Harry!

01:17:48.771 --> 01:17:50.636
That's my car!

01:17:58.614 --> 01:17:59.444
Yes.

01:17:59.649 --> 01:18:01.549
That's the shot I'm looking for.

01:18:13.062 --> 01:18:14.859
What is it you want from me?

01:18:15.064 --> 01:18:17.430
You've got it wrong, love.

01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:20.092
This is what you wanted.

01:18:20.403 --> 01:18:23.167
An exclusive interview.

01:18:24.073 --> 01:18:25.335
But you're not Swan.

01:18:25.541 --> 01:18:27.566
Shut up! You don't know!

01:18:27.777 --> 01:18:29.904
You don't know!

01:18:30.746 --> 01:18:32.441
I know who I am.

01:18:33.115 --> 01:18:34.548
Do you know who you are?

01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:35.780
Do you?!

01:18:35.985 --> 01:18:37.350
Yes.

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.187
All those films he made.

01:18:39.388 --> 01:18:41.583
Those are my nightmares, not his!

01:18:42.358 --> 01:18:46.419
Every night I dream,
and somehow he reads my mind.

01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:48.790
He stole my thoughts.

01:18:48.998 --> 01:18:53.594
He put my thoughts on film,
and he takes all the credit.

01:18:55.705 --> 01:18:57.730
He can't get away with it.

01:19:00.376 --> 01:19:02.173
He has to pay.

01:19:08.317 --> 01:19:10.444
He stole my nightmares
and made them real.

01:19:10.653 --> 01:19:12.518
So I stole his Dead Pool.

01:19:13.022 --> 01:19:15.616
I'll play his game and make it real.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:19.855
He can take credit for that.

01:20:45.748 --> 01:20:46.680
Drop it, Rook.

01:20:46.882 --> 01:20:51.114
You didn't die, Callahan,
so I had to find another celebrity.

01:20:55.624 --> 01:20:56.522
You're next.

01:20:56.725 --> 01:20:59.159
Shoot me, Callahan.

01:20:59.361 --> 01:21:00.919
Maybe you'll get lucky.

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:05.089
Maybe my muscles won't contract
and drive this knife into her throat.

01:21:06.669 --> 01:21:07.693
Let her go.

01:21:08.537 --> 01:21:09.834
First the gun.

01:21:10.039 --> 01:21:12.166
Drop it and kick it over to me.

01:21:16.278 --> 01:21:18.007
Time's up. What's it gonna be?

01:21:26.622 --> 01:21:27.884
What the fuck?

01:21:32.761 --> 01:21:35.093
You've locked yourself in, asshole.

01:21:35.631 --> 01:21:37.030
Yeah.

01:21:37.233 --> 01:21:39.030
Just you and me, asshole.

01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:43.203
The gun, Callahan.

01:21:45.074 --> 01:21:45.904
Now!

01:21:46.108 --> 01:21:46.972
No!

01:21:47.176 --> 01:21:48.871
He'll kill us both!

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.945
Oh, God.

01:22:03.158 --> 01:22:06.924
You let me down,
Mr. Famous-Fucking-Cop.

01:22:07.296 --> 01:22:08.957
You let Swan get away.

01:22:09.164 --> 01:22:10.756
You're the killer, not Swan.

01:22:11.066 --> 01:22:12.795
I should have killed you first.

01:22:13.002 --> 01:22:14.970
That was my big mistake.

01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:16.568
Now kick it over to me.

01:22:18.440 --> 01:22:20.408
Harry, don't.

01:22:29.318 --> 01:22:30.876
Think you're smart, don't you?

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:49.935
Callahan, you son of a bitch!

01:22:55.911 --> 01:22:57.742
I'm gonna kill you slow!

01:23:02.885 --> 01:23:04.876
Do you hear that, Callahan?!

01:24:21.730 --> 01:24:23.459
Stay in there.

01:25:32.668 --> 01:25:34.533
Callahan!

01:25:42.144 --> 01:25:44.339
Come on out, Callahan.

01:25:57.159 --> 01:25:59.525
There's nowhere left to run, Callahan.

01:26:00.462 --> 01:26:02.487
Don't make me come in and get you.

01:26:06.335 --> 01:26:07.962
The game's over!

01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:09.535
You're out of bullets.

01:26:39.368 --> 01:26:40.960
You know what that means.

01:26:43.071 --> 01:26:44.470
You're shit out of luck.

01:27:29.651 --> 01:27:32.552
- Where's Rook?
- He's hanging out back there.

01:27:38.026 --> 01:27:40.927
Inspector, was this another
hit attempt by Janero?

01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:43.689
Is it connected to the Dead Pool case?

01:27:44.305 --> 01:27:50.778
