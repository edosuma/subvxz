this is the fifth element

34:24.932 --> 34:25.280

34:27.804 --> 34:32.244
See, Don La Bianca
had the pipeline,

34:33.897 --> 34:37.684
and he supplied the North,
South, East and West.

34:39.990 --> 34:41.035
And he's done it peacefully.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.429
And he took pride in that.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.824
But with what Doc
Mays was up to,

34:50.958 --> 34:54.788
it wasn't coinciding
with the family's plan.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.225
- We need to keep it clean.

34:58.313 --> 35:00.141
We need to protect the pipeline.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.799
- The South side
and everything South

Doc Mays, he's loud, but he's
only loud on the North side.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.852
There's no need to worry Don.

35:18.551 --> 35:21.293
- Decency and peace,

35:22.511 --> 35:24.252
this is what we've
always had between us.

35:25.862 --> 35:27.081
We need to protect
the prior to that.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.960
- It bothers man, what
changed Doc Mays man?

35:37.004 --> 35:39.572

I need you to have my back.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.532

35:45.317 --> 35:46.492
- That's my business, man.

35:52.889 --> 35:54.848

35:54.891 --> 35:56.850
- Doc Mays, what's up baby.

35:58.591 --> 36:01.420
- What brings you up here to
my warehouse establishment?

36:01.463 --> 36:03.596
- Well you know I had
to see your pretty face.

36:03.639 --> 36:05.424

I ain't got no
problems with you.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.488

36:28.142 --> 36:30.318
- But I know you
on some bullshit.

36:30.362 --> 36:31.580

36:31.624 --> 36:33.539
Don't talk to me that way.

36:33.582 --> 36:36.019
- If you want some ANA,

36:36.063 --> 36:38.500
I want one little piece of
the pack, the West side.

36:39.936 --> 36:42.156

gonna like that man.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.115
- Don't worry about
Gloria, let me handle her.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.030

Timmy out to lunch,

time with the little barber.

46:52.548 --> 46:55.682
And his wife Leslie, she
was fine by Timmy too.

46:57.379 --> 47:02.994
It was almost like an outing
on a family structure.

47:03.037 --> 47:04.256
That was something Timmy needed.

47:06.214 --> 47:08.477
Poppa Benny supplied
that for him,

47:08.521 --> 47:10.436
he was more like his nest.

47:12.525 --> 47:15.136
He knows he felt
secure in there.

47:16.355 --> 47:17.225
He loved him.

47:32.588 --> 47:34.112
- Slim, Slim, Slim.

47:35.765 --> 47:37.724
What's going on Slim?

47:37.767 --> 47:40.770
I got a favor to talk
about here with you.

47:40.814 --> 47:43.425
Back in the days when I was
a baller, trying to come up,

47:45.775 --> 47:48.474
I went to one of my guys, to
buy a couple of them things,

47:50.302 --> 47:52.739
I asked him the price
and he told me the price,

47:52.782 --> 47:56.003
I said, damn, can you
cut it a little bit?

47:56.047 --> 48:01.661
'Cause we homies, he
said, yeah we friends,

48:01.704 --> 48:02.618
but this is a business.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.578
You understand?

48:05.621 --> 48:08.015
This is a business, and he
couldn't do that for me.

48:09.538 --> 48:13.586
So later on at night,
me and my friends,

48:13.629 --> 48:15.805
we went up to his room.

48:15.849 --> 48:16.763
He was knocked the fuck out.

48:18.069 --> 48:19.722
Girl must have put
the pussy on him.

48:19.766 --> 48:20.985
She must've had the bomb.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.204
I woke him up.

48:24.510 --> 48:27.774
[chuckling]

48:27.817 --> 48:28.862
I asked him where the work at.

48:32.126 --> 48:34.085
He said, I ain't
telling you shit.

48:35.738 --> 48:38.524
I said, wait a minute,
man, where they're work at?

48:38.567 --> 48:41.266
Again, he said, I
ain't telling you shit.

48:41.309 --> 48:44.225
So I tell Pony,

48:44.269 --> 48:46.662
I say Pony, give him some.

48:48.360 --> 48:51.667
Pony hit that nigga square
across the bridge of his nose

48:51.711 --> 48:54.757
and broke it, and you know what?

48:54.801 --> 48:57.543
He still didn't tell
me where the work was.

49:00.024 --> 49:04.506
I said, I'm gonna
take my time with him.

flipped that motherfucker over.

49:19.869 --> 49:21.567
And you know what I did,

49:21.610 --> 49:24.787
I dropped that arrogant square
on his motherfucking ass.

53:42.610 --> 53:44.482
every time I asked you
about my mom and dad,

53:44.525 --> 53:47.702
you sweep it under
a rock, why is that?

53:49.182 --> 53:52.229
- Timmy, I don't sweep
nothing under rock bro.

53:52.272 --> 53:54.709
Listen, let me tell
you this little story,

53:54.753 --> 53:56.842
about your father
and I when I was 17.

53:58.626 --> 54:01.455
Walking down the street,
I seen a guy on a corner.

54:03.022 --> 54:04.980
He's giving out orders,

54:05.024 --> 54:07.896
the ladies liked him and
the bros respected him,

54:07.940 --> 54:08.462
like a boss.

54:10.421 --> 54:13.206
Hey, he was the boss of bosses.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.861
So I said, I'm going
to work for that guy.

54:15.904 --> 54:17.732
- And then what happened?

54:17.776 --> 54:19.168
- So I walked up to him,

54:20.953 --> 54:25.044
yeah, I said, can
I work for you?

54:25.087 --> 54:26.306
- What do you think?

54:26.350 --> 54:28.656
- He said to me,
Shortie go to school.

bags out over there,

54:46.065 --> 54:47.588
and bring me back
what it gave you.

- So what was in the package?

54:49.721 --> 54:50.765
- I don't know,

54:50.809 --> 54:52.201
he gave me a couple of dollars.

I had a lot of money.

you, you're family.

my mum was a crack head,

55:12.961 --> 55:13.527
is that true?

55:19.011 --> 55:23.537
- Hey Timmy, bad things
happen to good people.

When you're in the world of
drugs, sometimes things happen.

55:30.805 --> 55:33.286
But I can tell you one
thing, she loved you.

55:35.506 --> 55:37.159
Do you understand?

55:37.203 --> 55:39.423
- If she loved me, then
why'd she leave me?

55:43.078 --> 55:44.341
- I can't explain this son.
