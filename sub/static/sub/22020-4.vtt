WEBVTT

00:03.224 --> 00:04.915
<i>All right, now you gotta blow</i>
during the <i>that candle out, boy,</i>

00:04.939 --> 00:06.006
make sure you make a wish.

00:06.031 --> 00:07.127
All right, all right.

00:07.684 --> 00:09.393
There you go. First try.

00:09.434 --> 00:11.840
15's a big year, Jordan.

00:11.865 --> 00:13.028
Yeah, man, it's a powerful year.

00:13.052 --> 00:15.082
You gotta do your thing in
the classroom, on that court.

00:15.106 --> 00:16.239
Always preaching.

00:16.274 --> 00:17.474
Nah, that's advice.

00:17.508 --> 00:18.839
Yeah, it's a big difference.

00:18.864 --> 00:20.464
- Says you.
- Vinessa.

00:20.499 --> 00:23.044
- Happy birthday, lil' dog.
- Ooh, you know what I wanted.

00:23.069 --> 00:24.349
- Yes, boy.
- My God.

00:24.374 --> 00:25.782
Look at this.

00:27.057 --> 00:29.094
This number 8... it worked
for Kobe a little bit.

00:29.119 --> 00:30.805
It worked for me; It's
definitely gonna work for you.

00:30.829 --> 00:32.797
Thanks, bro.

00:33.370 --> 00:35.471
Yo, um, I think Ruzek needs me

00:35.496 --> 00:37.229
to do that undercover thing
he got a bite on.

00:37.253 --> 00:38.436
I'll go.

00:38.470 --> 00:40.808
Actually, you might have
the wrong paint job.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.233
Okay.

00:42.268 --> 00:45.370
I can, um, stay here
and help them eat cake.

00:45.404 --> 00:47.323
Copy that. Hey, check this out.

00:47.348 --> 00:50.475
I wanna send a toast to my
little brother Jordan, okay?

00:50.509 --> 00:51.801
Yeah.

00:51.826 --> 00:53.878
Let's make 15
the most powerful year ever.

00:53.913 --> 00:55.780
- No doubt.
- No doubt.

00:55.814 --> 00:57.282
Aw, dude, I forgot to tell you,

00:57.316 --> 00:58.950
I tried the barbecue sauce you sent me.

00:58.984 --> 01:00.818
- It was good, right?
- Come on, man.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.103
Look, it's gonna be big someday,

01:02.127 --> 01:04.099
I'm trying to tell you... just
need to line up the financing.

01:04.123 --> 01:05.597
I got your financing right here.

01:05.622 --> 01:08.059
Speaking of which, why don't
you show me a few stacks?

01:08.093 --> 01:09.909
- Make me feel at ease.
- You don't trust me?

01:09.934 --> 01:11.777
I don't trust my own mama
when it comes to

01:11.824 --> 01:13.599
money and drugs and she's a damn saint.

01:13.624 --> 01:15.060
All right, all right.

01:15.094 --> 01:18.070
Look, I'm doing this for you,
bro, but Kurtis don't play.

01:18.095 --> 01:19.625
Like, not even a little bit.

01:19.650 --> 01:21.338
Especially when white boys get involved.

01:21.363 --> 01:22.535
Yeah, I picked up on that.

01:22.560 --> 01:23.825
I thought he was all right
the other night though.

01:23.849 --> 01:25.694
No, he don't dig white people.

01:25.957 --> 01:27.230
I'm telling you like it is, Billy,

01:27.247 --> 01:28.948
so just show me
what's in the bag, please.

01:28.982 --> 01:31.617
- You know the drill. You know the drill.
- Come on, man.

01:31.651 --> 01:33.252
My goodness. I'm not holdin'.

01:33.286 --> 01:34.954
I'm never holdin'.

01:34.988 --> 01:36.899
I'm a broker, baby,
like them dudes on Wall Street.

01:36.923 --> 01:39.725
I set the deals up and get
a little taste, that's it.

01:41.094 --> 01:42.605
Yes, sir. As a reminder, you know I'm...

01:42.629 --> 01:44.797
- $3,000. I remember.
- Okay.

01:44.831 --> 01:46.498
- We good?
- Good.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.167
- We good.
- All right, I'll call Kurtis.

01:48.201 --> 01:51.303
My man. Let's do this.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.341
Englewood, Englewood.

01:55.375 --> 01:56.809
Yeah, yeah, up to no good.

01:56.843 --> 01:58.616
Come on, man.
Come up with something new.

01:58.641 --> 02:00.172
And that song
ain't even talking about...

02:00.196 --> 02:01.118
I know.

02:01.143 --> 02:02.494
<i>It's talking about
a different Englewood.</i>

02:02.518 --> 02:04.950
So, this kid Kurtis
is moving real weight?

02:04.985 --> 02:07.653
He's more of an upandcomer.

02:07.687 --> 02:10.089
He's got a direct line
to the Sinaloa cartel.

02:11.791 --> 02:14.093
It's not easy to get a kid
from this neighborhood to flip.

02:14.127 --> 02:18.197
Till he's staring down
ten years at Stateville.

02:18.231 --> 02:19.765
<i>Got something to say now.</i>

02:19.799 --> 02:21.010
- 'Sup, Andre?
- What's happening?

02:21.034 --> 02:22.434
Good to see you.

02:22.469 --> 02:25.388
What's up, big dog?

02:25.805 --> 02:27.201
How you feeling, Billy?

02:27.226 --> 02:28.807
I'm great. How you doing?

02:28.842 --> 02:30.476
Hey.

02:31.645 --> 02:33.112
Cell phones in the basket.

02:40.153 --> 02:41.954
Have a seat, fellas.

02:43.000 --> 02:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:51.733 --> 02:53.967
So, the West Loop?

02:54.016 --> 02:56.017
It's a huge, untapped market.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.085
Tons of rich white dudes
looking to party.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.188
The only problem is there's
no quality product there.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.823
What's Eddie's cut?

03:02.858 --> 03:04.843
Three grand.

03:06.595 --> 03:08.029
I forgot...

03:08.063 --> 03:09.397
How'd you two meet?

03:09.431 --> 03:11.212
Ballet.

03:11.237 --> 03:12.649
What?

03:12.735 --> 03:15.369
Yeah, the spot with the disco
balls and the dancer poles.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.772
On 28th and Jefferson, you know?

03:17.806 --> 03:19.073
That kind of ballet.

03:19.107 --> 03:20.508
I was dating one of the ballerinas.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.510
Yeah, me too.

03:22.544 --> 03:23.598
Sorta.

03:23.632 --> 03:25.169
I had to pay her a little
somethingsomething

03:25.193 --> 03:27.021
from time to time,
but she was worth every penny.

03:27.045 --> 03:28.928
- Yeah, she was a fox.
- Yeah.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.025
Well, I'm glad you two hit it off.

03:48.079 --> 03:51.381
It's nice to see you again, Billy.

04:03.450 --> 04:04.817
What happened?

04:04.842 --> 04:06.264
I don't know.
It felt good, and then bam,

04:06.288 --> 04:08.055
he was out the door. Meeting over.

04:08.090 --> 04:09.315
You think they made Kev?

04:09.378 --> 04:11.792
Nah, I mean, I was staring at
my cheeseburger the whole time.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.594
Who knows, maybe he's just careful.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.296
Hey, good news
is Eddie's still on board.

04:15.330 --> 04:17.769
He just texted me, wants me to
swing by his house in a few hours.

04:17.793 --> 04:19.534
Good, play it out.
Kev, keep an eye on him.

04:19.559 --> 04:21.773
Hey, man, don't push it.
There's other dealers we can work with.

04:21.797 --> 04:23.265
Not like Kurtis, there's not.

04:23.299 --> 04:24.759
Yeah? Why's he so special?

04:24.784 --> 04:27.252
He likes killing
as much as he likes dealing.

04:27.403 --> 04:30.238
He enjoys it.

04:30.859 --> 04:32.860
Eddie, where you at, man?

04:32.894 --> 04:34.328
Call number three.

04:34.362 --> 04:35.571
Listen, I'm getting a little nervous.

04:35.595 --> 04:37.581
I don't know if you noticed
I'm a preppy white dude

04:37.605 --> 04:40.374
from the northern suburbs,
so you need to hit me back.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.003
I'm at your door.

04:49.878 --> 04:51.673
Eddie?

04:55.016 --> 04:57.017
Eddie. Hey!

05:03.725 --> 05:06.727
- Kev, cover the front.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

05:20.074 --> 05:21.671
Kev, roll an ambo. Right now.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.187
- Eddie? Eddie?
<i>- Copy.</i>

05:23.212 --> 05:24.688
Hey, what happened, man? Who did this?

05:24.712 --> 05:26.446
Jesus. Eddie.

05:26.642 --> 05:29.811
We're gonna stop the bleeding.
You just hold on, man.

05:29.884 --> 05:32.519
Eddie, listen, I'm sorry to
tell you this, but I'm a cop.

05:32.554 --> 05:34.488
I got help on the way right now, okay?

05:34.522 --> 05:36.733
You just gotta stay strong.

05:36.758 --> 05:39.693
No, Eddie, stop, man. Stop. Stop.

05:39.727 --> 05:41.605
- You're a cop! You're a...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

05:41.629 --> 05:43.682
You gotta talk to me.
Tell me who did this.

05:43.707 --> 05:45.074
Was it Kurtis?

05:45.200 --> 05:46.767
What's...

05:46.801 --> 05:49.869
Your real name?

05:50.972 --> 05:52.105
It's Adam.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.341
Adam Ruzek.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.491
Hey, brother. Listen, look at me.

05:56.516 --> 05:57.726
Who did it?

05:57.751 --> 05:59.359
Tell me, was it Kurtis who did this?

05:59.384 --> 06:01.519
- Was it Kurtis?
- No.

06:01.544 --> 06:03.845
I ain't going out like that,

06:04.052 --> 06:05.052
Adam.

06:05.086 --> 06:06.954
Like what, man? Hey.

06:06.988 --> 06:08.021
Hey.

06:08.056 --> 06:09.938
Like...

06:10.124 --> 06:12.376
Like a snitch.

06:15.563 --> 06:17.812
Nah, man, no, no, no.

06:21.302 --> 06:22.903
Eddie, come on, man.

06:22.928 --> 06:25.077
Eddie?

06:25.532 --> 06:27.646
Come on, man!

06:50.825 --> 06:53.260
- What do we got?
- What's up?

06:53.294 --> 06:55.095
Two to the chest. Nine millimeter.

06:55.130 --> 06:56.430
The casings are right here.

06:56.464 --> 06:59.133
- Find a gun?
- Not yet.

07:00.368 --> 07:01.368
You okay?

07:01.402 --> 07:02.803
Yeah.

07:02.837 --> 07:04.972
This was Kurtis or somebody
that worked for him.

07:05.006 --> 07:06.440
It had to be.

07:06.474 --> 07:08.041
Well, now we follow the evidence.

07:08.076 --> 07:10.144
Grab Upton and Halstead. Start knocking.

07:10.178 --> 07:11.712
We need witnesses.

07:11.746 --> 07:13.313
Yeah.

07:18.052 --> 07:20.788
He was alive when I got here.

07:20.822 --> 07:22.790
He was alive, right there.

07:24.659 --> 07:27.027
I was trying to help him.
Told him I was a cop.

07:29.764 --> 07:31.498
The way he looked at me, man.

07:31.533 --> 07:33.634
Pushed my hands away.

07:33.668 --> 07:37.304
He knew why he got shot...
'cause I got made...

07:37.338 --> 07:39.339
And he picked up the tab.

07:39.374 --> 07:40.741
Hey.

07:40.775 --> 07:42.676
I understand.

07:42.710 --> 07:45.679
I get it, I mean,
you really liked Eddie.

07:45.713 --> 07:47.714
But this isn't on you, dog.

07:47.749 --> 07:49.483
You didn't pull that trigger.

07:52.854 --> 07:54.021
- All right?
- Thanks, bro.

07:54.055 --> 07:56.056
We'll get him.

08:00.228 --> 08:02.396
I didn't see anything or hear anything.

08:02.430 --> 08:05.566
You live across the street,
20 feet from his house.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.001
I was watching TV, had the volume up.

08:08.036 --> 08:09.036
Anything else?

08:09.070 --> 08:10.671
You knew Eddie, right?

08:10.705 --> 08:12.005
Yeah? Was he a good guy?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.407
- Great guy.
- Yeah?

08:13.441 --> 08:15.209
Why not help us find
the man who killed him?

08:15.243 --> 08:16.610
Not my job.

08:16.644 --> 08:18.111
You're okay with him getting killed?

08:18.146 --> 08:19.223
Didn't say I was okay with it.

08:19.247 --> 08:20.681
I said it's not my job.

08:20.715 --> 08:22.850
There's a difference.

08:22.884 --> 08:25.619
Not really.

08:25.653 --> 08:27.721
I mean, you live right next door, right?

08:27.755 --> 08:30.047
You didn't hear anything?

08:30.792 --> 08:34.508
All right, hey, just tell us
what you heard, please.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.869
I didn't hear anything.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.537
You didn't hear anything?

08:43.571 --> 08:45.038
All right. Hey.

08:45.073 --> 08:47.040
- Have you seen this guy?
- No.

08:47.075 --> 08:48.709
You didn't even look yet.

08:48.743 --> 08:49.776
Have you seen this guy?

08:49.811 --> 08:50.911
- No.
- Never?

08:50.945 --> 08:53.060
Never.

08:54.282 --> 08:56.771
Thank you so much.

09:02.290 --> 09:05.325
This no snitch thing
gets worse and worse.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.095
There's no trust.
There's no cooperation.

09:08.129 --> 09:09.607
Remember a few years back
when they at least

09:09.631 --> 09:12.065
gave a courtesy look,
and then a respectful lie?

09:12.100 --> 09:13.367
Yeah.

09:14.502 --> 09:17.070
So this is spottercam video.

09:17.105 --> 09:20.807
It's not perfect, but here's the shot.

09:20.842 --> 09:21.942
Swivels.

09:21.976 --> 09:23.176
There's our guy.

09:23.211 --> 09:24.578
Yeah. Sure looks like Kurtis.

09:24.612 --> 09:26.146
About the same height, same weight.

09:26.180 --> 09:27.614
Yeah, but we can't see his face.

09:27.649 --> 09:29.013
Definitely not enough for a warrant.

09:29.037 --> 09:31.652
It's enough for you to grab
Antonio and pay him a visit.

09:31.686 --> 09:33.453
Yup.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.577
Well, let's watch this again.

09:35.602 --> 09:37.034
So, what happened...
Kurtis shoots Eddie,

09:37.058 --> 09:38.158
he goes running out the back?

09:38.182 --> 09:39.837
Yeah, but the bloody
footprints that I saw...

09:39.861 --> 09:41.005
they went out the front door.

09:41.029 --> 09:42.204
It could be two shooters.

09:42.229 --> 09:45.365
One goes out the front,
the other goes out the back.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.187
Hey, you two...
head over to that restaurant

09:47.212 --> 09:48.612
and figure out what happened, will you?

09:48.636 --> 09:50.637
- Okay.
- Something spooked these guys.

09:58.882 --> 10:00.948
Kurtis Washington, Chicago PD.

10:00.982 --> 10:02.693
We'd like to talk to you
about a friend of yours,

10:02.717 --> 10:04.359
Eddie Greene.

10:05.853 --> 10:06.987
Got nothing to say.

10:07.021 --> 10:08.789
He was killed last night.

10:08.823 --> 10:09.957
Got nothing to say.

10:09.991 --> 10:11.255
We have reason to believe

10:11.280 --> 10:12.739
that you were with him
earlier that evening.

10:12.763 --> 10:14.371
Maybe you could help us
find the man who killed him

10:14.395 --> 10:16.229
since you two are friends?

10:16.264 --> 10:17.441
Got nothing to say.

10:18.637 --> 10:21.134
Do you know what a spotter cam is?

10:21.169 --> 10:22.799
- I got nothing to say.
- Okay.

10:22.824 --> 10:24.571
It's this amazing
new piece of technology.

10:24.605 --> 10:26.573
When a gun is fired, a video camera just

10:26.607 --> 10:30.010
automatically swivels towards
the direction of the sound.

10:30.044 --> 10:31.812
And the dude running away

10:31.846 --> 10:33.647
sure looks a lot like you.

10:36.517 --> 10:38.636
Like I said, officer...

10:39.053 --> 10:41.144
I got nothing to say.

10:43.524 --> 10:46.560
Okay, don't worry. We'll be back.

10:53.868 --> 10:55.736
How can I help you?

10:55.770 --> 10:58.872
We wanna talk to you about
one of your regular customers,

10:58.906 --> 11:00.540
Kurtis Washington.

11:00.575 --> 11:03.176
Chicken, extra spicy, French fries.

11:03.211 --> 11:04.578
Arnold Palmer.

11:04.612 --> 11:06.346
More lemonade than tea.

11:06.381 --> 11:08.215
We're more interested
in his business dealings

11:08.249 --> 11:09.349
than his food choices.

11:09.384 --> 11:10.684
You got a men's room?

11:12.987 --> 11:14.454
What about Andre Walker?

11:14.489 --> 11:16.356
Ham and cheese sandwich, extra swiss.

11:16.391 --> 11:18.425
Back to food?

11:18.459 --> 11:20.861
That's my business. Food.

11:20.895 --> 11:22.229
Nothing else.

11:25.266 --> 11:26.933
May I say...

11:28.569 --> 11:32.239
You might be the prettiest
damn police I've ever seen.

11:32.273 --> 11:33.473
Might be?

11:33.508 --> 11:36.143
Okay, you are.

11:36.177 --> 11:37.878
That's better.

11:37.912 --> 11:42.382
So, Kurtis and Andre came
in yesterday with Eddie Greene

11:42.492 --> 11:44.384
and another guy. White guy.

11:44.419 --> 11:45.786
Don't know Eddie.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.287
Or the white dude.

11:47.321 --> 11:48.722
Anything unusual happen?

11:48.756 --> 11:51.124
Didn't even notice they were here.

11:51.159 --> 11:52.492
You're good.

11:52.535 --> 11:54.851
That's why I'm still standing, baby.

11:55.329 --> 11:56.730
Thank you.

11:56.756 --> 11:57.820
Thank you.

11:57.845 --> 12:01.023
Your insights and observations
were invaluable.

12:04.537 --> 12:07.138
Found a countersurveillance
device in the restaurant.

12:07.275 --> 12:08.585
The kind you can buy
for five bucks at some

12:08.609 --> 12:10.310
halfassed spy store.

12:10.344 --> 12:12.245
Must've read the transmission
from Ruzek's wire,

12:12.280 --> 12:13.814
so Kurtis cut the meeting short.

12:13.848 --> 12:15.426
They probably thought
Eddie was snitching...

12:15.450 --> 12:16.983
working a case, so he popped him,

12:17.018 --> 12:18.452
Two in the chest.

12:18.486 --> 12:20.687
Hey, techs lifted two fresh prints...

12:20.721 --> 12:22.589
one off of a beer bottle
in Eddie's living room

12:22.623 --> 12:24.291
and the other off the front door knob.

12:24.325 --> 12:26.159
Both are a match to Roland Garrett.

12:26.194 --> 12:28.428
Male, black, 36. One felony charge.

12:28.463 --> 12:29.963
Aggravated assault with a firearm.

12:29.997 --> 12:31.598
Track him down, now.

12:44.532 --> 12:46.007
- Roland Garrett?
- Yes?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.681
- Chicago PD.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:47.715 --> 12:48.824
- Keep your hands up.
- Man, what's going on?

12:48.848 --> 12:50.153
We need to talk. Step down to me.

12:50.177 --> 12:52.119
- About what?
- Eddie Greene. Turn around.

12:52.153 --> 12:53.453
Someone killed him last night.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.488
I know.

12:54.522 --> 12:55.689
You know he's dead?

12:55.723 --> 12:56.990
Yeah.

12:57.024 --> 12:59.292
He's my brother.

13:08.242 --> 13:10.429
My fingerprints are
on a beer bottle, so what?

13:10.867 --> 13:13.035
Well, the beer was still
cold when we bagged it.

13:13.521 --> 13:16.872
That means you were there
when your brother got shot.

13:16.906 --> 13:19.318
So, either A, you did it,

13:19.389 --> 13:21.991
or B, you saw who did.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.335
Or C, I was there,

13:23.369 --> 13:24.970
but I didn't do it and I didn't see it.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.454
- Hey.
- Bro, what's up, Kevin?

13:28.479 --> 13:29.808
You good?

13:29.842 --> 13:32.286
Roland owns the mini mart on my block.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.279
Good people.

13:34.413 --> 13:37.048
Um, so, yeah, we just wanna
know what happened.

13:37.083 --> 13:39.451
And actually the more we know,
the more we can help out,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.487
so, what you know, dog?

13:45.924 --> 13:47.995
Okay.

13:48.414 --> 13:50.282
I was there.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.531
I went to see Eddie,
you know, to say hi.

13:53.556 --> 13:54.844
Pay my condolences,

13:54.877 --> 13:56.644
'cause I ain't seen him
since his pop passed.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.870
We got the same mother,
different fathers.

13:58.905 --> 14:00.038
Right.

14:00.072 --> 14:01.469
So, what happened?

14:01.494 --> 14:02.795
We were catching up.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.544
Eddie was, He was nervous.

14:05.578 --> 14:07.879
Said he had some deal with somebody

14:07.914 --> 14:09.525
and somebody got spooked
or something like that,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.229
I don't know.
I don't really pay attention.

14:11.297 --> 14:13.599
You know, I loved Eddie,
but he's always hustling.

14:13.633 --> 14:16.435
Anyway, some... some guy shows up.

14:16.469 --> 14:18.771
But he... he knocked at the
back door; I didn't see him.

14:18.805 --> 14:21.306
I went to the kitchen
to make a sandwich.

14:22.475 --> 14:25.310
- You didn't see him?
- No, sir.

14:33.044 --> 14:35.586
Size 11?

14:35.922 --> 14:37.156
Yeah.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.961
We got your footprint, Roland.

14:42.996 --> 14:44.963
Bloody footprints.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.998
That means you were near Eddie's body.

14:51.671 --> 14:53.350
Yeah.

14:56.442 --> 14:58.911
After the dude shot Eddie, I...

14:59.879 --> 15:01.966
He ran out the back door.

15:02.378 --> 15:04.246
So I walked over to Eddie,

15:04.350 --> 15:06.251
and I saw he was shot.

15:06.349 --> 15:08.536
He was...

15:09.055 --> 15:10.895
He was crawling towards the door.

15:11.942 --> 15:13.520
I got scared.

15:14.528 --> 15:16.926
So...

15:17.697 --> 15:20.264
So, I ran out the front door.

15:21.634 --> 15:24.169
But yo, II called 911
like two minutes later.

15:24.204 --> 15:26.491
- Y'all can check the records.
- Yeah, we will.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.174
Listen...

15:29.209 --> 15:31.043
II gotta ask this.

15:33.813 --> 15:36.682
Why not help save your brother's life?

15:38.084 --> 15:41.350
I sell... I sell condoms
and candy bars, homey.

15:41.654 --> 15:43.077
I'm not equipped to save nobody's life.

15:43.101 --> 15:45.100
But if you saw photos,
you could recognize the guy.

15:45.124 --> 15:46.592
No!

15:48.100 --> 15:49.881
I didn't... I didn't see his face.

15:49.906 --> 15:51.531
This is your flesh and blood, Roland.

15:51.556 --> 15:53.633
I know.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.201
But he's gone.

15:56.236 --> 15:59.204
I still gotta live there.

15:59.239 --> 16:01.039
- Kev, you know how it is.
- Yeah.

16:01.074 --> 16:02.851
You know, I know.

16:03.309 --> 16:05.555
There's a difference this time.

16:06.312 --> 16:08.547
All right? This is me.

16:08.581 --> 16:10.883
And I can help you on this side.

16:13.695 --> 16:15.740
You're good, bro.

16:16.022 --> 16:17.748
I...

16:21.995 --> 16:23.395
I ain't no hero, Kev.

16:27.164 --> 16:30.659
Just another brother
trying to pay his rent,

16:31.337 --> 16:33.299
maybe have a little fun,

16:34.141 --> 16:36.002
stay above ground.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.918
I don't care
how much you hate the police.

16:45.952 --> 16:47.763
If you got family involved,
you gotta come clean.

16:47.787 --> 16:49.327
The victim himself
wouldn't even give me a name

16:49.351 --> 16:51.133
and he's lying there dying
and the last thing he says is

16:51.157 --> 16:52.373
"I ain't no snitch."

16:52.398 --> 16:53.799
Talk about taking it to your grave.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.471
Hey, guys, found some video surveillance

16:55.495 --> 16:56.669
from the night of the murder.

16:56.694 --> 16:58.597
It's not perfect,
but it shows a distant image

16:58.631 --> 17:00.100
of the man we believe
to be Kurtis Washington

17:00.124 --> 17:02.501
hopping into a BMW
two blocks from Eddie's house.

17:02.535 --> 17:04.310
- You make out the plate?
- Already ran it.

17:04.335 --> 17:05.948
It's registered to Maya
Spriggs, girlfriend of

17:05.972 --> 17:07.665
Andre Walker,
mother of his three children.

17:07.690 --> 17:10.111
So Andre was the getaway
driver, that makes sense.

17:10.136 --> 17:11.162
They're partners.

17:11.186 --> 17:13.813
All right, get that car.
Maybe we can find some blood.

17:25.258 --> 17:27.025
There's a warrant for the car.

17:27.060 --> 17:28.551
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:28.577 --> 17:30.395
- Baby, that's my car.
- I got this, baby.

17:30.430 --> 17:32.030
Wait, why does he need to?

17:32.055 --> 17:33.655
Go back to the kids.

17:33.782 --> 17:36.884
Keep them away from
all this police harassment.

17:42.408 --> 17:43.976
'Sup, Billy?

17:44.010 --> 17:46.269
Long time no see.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.558
What you doing over here?

17:50.525 --> 17:52.839
Thought you lived in the West Loop.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.519
Word is, there's a huge,

17:54.554 --> 17:56.847
untapped market for blow up there?

17:58.692 --> 18:01.378
Just so you know, Eddie...
he had no idea I was a cop.

18:02.428 --> 18:04.062
No idea.

18:05.798 --> 18:07.534
You know, I liked Eddie.

18:08.368 --> 18:10.135
Kurtis did too.

18:10.803 --> 18:12.871
We feel real bad you got his ass popped.

18:14.707 --> 18:16.602
You better watch yourself, Andre.

18:16.709 --> 18:19.031
Sounds like a confession to me.

18:20.406 --> 18:22.407
I ain't killed nobody.

18:23.082 --> 18:25.700
And I don't know nobody
who killed nobody.

18:26.319 --> 18:28.450
But word gets out around here.

18:28.588 --> 18:31.123
And snitches like Eddie
get dealt with real fast.

18:33.559 --> 18:35.779
Well, let's go.

18:36.601 --> 18:38.670
Listen to your girlfriend,

18:39.899 --> 18:41.677
Billy.

18:42.659 --> 18:44.552
We'll see you soon.

18:45.405 --> 18:48.344
Andre's BMW is clean.
No blood evidence anywhere.

18:48.369 --> 18:49.936
Yeah? What about Eddie's house?

18:49.961 --> 18:51.881
Techs are still working
on it... so far, nothing.

18:51.911 --> 18:53.879
There's gotta be something.

18:53.913 --> 18:55.380
A print? A hair?

18:55.415 --> 18:56.581
Seriously?

18:56.616 --> 18:57.852
We know that Kurtis popped him.

18:57.876 --> 18:59.918
We know that Andre
picked him up in the BMW.

18:59.952 --> 19:02.220
Yeah, well, knowing
doesn't mean a damn thing.

19:02.255 --> 19:04.423
So, go out there and find something.

19:05.368 --> 19:06.735
God.

19:06.760 --> 19:09.061
Hey, Adam.

19:09.262 --> 19:11.129
You gotta let it go.

19:11.164 --> 19:12.300
I mean, good guy or not,

19:12.325 --> 19:14.599
Eddie was in the game. He knew the risk.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.234
- Yeah.
- Hey.

19:16.269 --> 19:18.570
One of my Cis just told me
that Andre's girl, Maya,

19:18.604 --> 19:20.357
deals dope out of
a unlicensed beauty salon

19:20.382 --> 19:21.749
and she's got two priors.

19:21.941 --> 19:23.408
- That's something.
- Yeah.

19:23.443 --> 19:24.810
Take Burgess and Upton.

19:24.844 --> 19:26.411
- Let's go.
- All right, copy that.

19:26.446 --> 19:27.459
Chicago PD!

19:27.484 --> 19:29.569
- Everyone show us your hands now.
- What the hell is going on?

19:29.593 --> 19:31.260
- Hands up, we have a warrant.
- Turn around.

19:31.284 --> 19:32.918
Maya, right? Turn around for me.

19:32.952 --> 19:34.600
Turn around for me.
Just wanna see what kind

19:34.624 --> 19:36.755
of beauty products you're
pushing out of this joint.

19:38.491 --> 19:39.868
All right, sorry about that, ladies.

19:39.892 --> 19:41.626
Come on now.

19:43.155 --> 19:44.338
Baby.

19:44.363 --> 19:45.730
Baby, come get me.

19:45.814 --> 19:47.548
Look, I will. Just sit tight.

19:47.573 --> 19:50.602
Ask for a lawyer
and keep your damn mouth shut.

19:50.636 --> 19:52.337
This is harassment!

19:52.371 --> 19:54.765
You know that, right?

19:58.311 --> 20:00.145
Andre.

20:00.179 --> 20:03.541
It's not our fault your lady
runs a salon without a license.

20:03.737 --> 20:05.438
And sells blow in her spare time.

20:05.463 --> 20:06.580
What'd you find?

20:06.605 --> 20:08.773
What, a couple grams?
Eight ball or something?

20:09.214 --> 20:11.995
- She don't move no product.
- The problem is, she's got two priors.

20:12.258 --> 20:15.886
With this new charge, she's going away.

20:16.003 --> 20:17.496
She's a threetime loser.

20:17.530 --> 20:18.851
Mother of your children.

20:18.876 --> 20:20.509
Unless, of course,
you got something to tell us.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.953
Something that might, I don't know,

20:22.016 --> 20:24.269
inspire us to drop the case?

20:26.490 --> 20:28.253
Nope.

20:28.508 --> 20:30.355
Not a damn thing.

20:30.667 --> 20:33.143
You know, I'm getting sick
and tired of her ass anyway.

20:33.846 --> 20:35.823
Truth is, you're doing me a favor.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.656
Wow, hell of a guy...

20:37.683 --> 20:39.061
Shut up, bitch, I wasn't talking to...

20:39.085 --> 20:40.929
You got a smart mouth, you know that!

20:40.954 --> 20:42.487
Stand up! Say that again, right now!

20:42.514 --> 20:44.368
- Enough!
- I'll take this badge off.

20:44.392 --> 20:47.025
You and I could do this
right now, man! Come on, Hailey,

20:47.050 --> 20:48.404
what the hell is wrong with you?
What are you doing?

20:48.428 --> 20:49.895
What is wrong with you?

20:50.488 --> 20:53.528
Reform, federal oversight,
independent auditors.

20:53.699 --> 20:56.183
You can't just hit people
because they piss you off.

20:56.469 --> 20:58.285
Not in front of me, anyway.

20:59.248 --> 21:01.082
Get in the car.

21:06.612 --> 21:08.180
Andre's not gonna flip.

21:08.214 --> 21:10.749
He didn't even flinch.

21:10.783 --> 21:12.240
In Pilsen, they don't talk
'cause they're afraid

21:12.264 --> 21:13.302
of getting deported.

21:13.327 --> 21:16.254
In Englewood,
they're afraid of getting shot.

21:16.289 --> 21:17.900
Look, I'll be in late tomorrow.
I have a parentteacher

21:17.924 --> 21:20.125
conference thing I have to be at.

21:20.159 --> 21:23.028
Yo, Sarge, let me grab
Roland one more time.

21:23.062 --> 21:25.063
I mean, I think deep down
he wants to talk.

21:25.097 --> 21:26.875
I can convince him to if he can
just wrap his head around it.

21:26.899 --> 21:28.967
Not a lot to wrap your head around.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.579
Someone shoots your brother
twice in the chest,

21:30.603 --> 21:31.853
you bury his ass.

21:31.878 --> 21:33.127
See, it's deeper than that.

21:33.152 --> 21:34.719
My God, it was his brother.

21:35.065 --> 21:36.824
Somebody shot his brother,
he's the only person

21:36.848 --> 21:38.654
that can help us, and he's
gonna protect the killer?

21:38.678 --> 21:39.768
That's not what I'm saying.

21:39.793 --> 21:41.780
What I'm saying is, where I come from,

21:41.814 --> 21:43.592
or where Roland lives,
if you don't trust the cops,

21:43.616 --> 21:45.227
- you're not gonna cooperate.
- It's called being a coward...

21:45.251 --> 21:47.237
Enough of this crap, you hear me?

21:48.955 --> 21:50.822
I don't care about what's right.

21:50.856 --> 21:53.291
I care about making this case.

21:53.326 --> 21:55.203
You understand?

21:55.593 --> 21:57.160
Yeah.

21:57.185 --> 21:58.296
All right, good.

21:58.331 --> 21:59.547
So, talk to Roland.

21:59.578 --> 22:01.279
- A'ight.
- He comes forward,

22:01.368 --> 22:03.969
maybe we can offer witness protection.

22:05.471 --> 22:07.572
We might have to come up
with another plan.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.108
What's going on?

22:18.684 --> 22:21.385
Male, black, late 20s. Two to the chest.

22:21.542 --> 22:23.743
- Victim's name...
- Roland Garrett.

22:35.553 --> 22:38.987
Hey, boss... two nine
millimeter shells on the floor.

22:39.022 --> 22:40.422
We are sSurveillance video?

22:40.457 --> 22:42.763
Yeah, there's two cameras in here.
But neither one of them work.

22:42.787 --> 22:44.455
- The register?
- It's full.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.007
Shooter just walked in, took
two shots, and walked out.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.929
This was Kurtis.
We all know that, right?

22:48.954 --> 22:51.538
He obviously figured out
Roland was at Eddie's house

22:51.563 --> 22:53.964
and didn't wanna roll the dice
he'd keep his mouth shut.

22:54.899 --> 22:57.073
Hey, patrol found a witness
who says they saw a guy

22:57.098 --> 22:58.900
run from the scene,
drop something in the dumpster

22:58.924 --> 23:01.058
- behind the building.
- Go check it out.

23:01.093 --> 23:03.394
You two start knocking,
see what you can find.

23:03.428 --> 23:04.639
Someone had to see something.

23:04.686 --> 23:06.554
Yeah, but will someone talk to us?

23:08.664 --> 23:10.332
You got it. Come on.

23:19.701 --> 23:21.760
Kev.

23:22.204 --> 23:23.471
Is that Jordan?

23:25.192 --> 23:27.760
Damn. Hold on.

23:29.077 --> 23:30.592
Jordan!

23:31.413 --> 23:33.788
Yo, what the hell
are you doing out here, man?

23:33.984 --> 23:36.218
Hey. Come here.

23:36.651 --> 23:38.219
Man, what the hell is going on, bro?

23:38.253 --> 23:39.520
It's damn near 11:00.

23:39.554 --> 23:40.595
What you doing out here?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.690
I was walking back
from Michelle's house, and...

23:42.724 --> 23:44.225
we were studying and I fell asleep...

23:44.259 --> 23:45.860
Fell asleep my ass, Jordan.

23:45.894 --> 23:47.638
Now we done already had
this conversation, dog,

23:47.662 --> 23:48.973
I'm your big brother
and the last thing...

23:48.997 --> 23:50.765
I know, I know.

23:50.799 --> 23:52.600
What happened?

23:54.236 --> 23:55.269
Nothing good.

23:58.306 --> 23:59.904
Bro...

24:00.275 --> 24:01.966
That's Roland?

24:02.244 --> 24:03.444
Yeah.

24:09.785 --> 24:11.177
I liked him, bro.

24:11.202 --> 24:13.454
I mean, when I told him
I made the basketball team,

24:13.488 --> 24:14.822
he gave me a bunch of free food.

24:14.856 --> 24:16.456
He even said
he'd make it to a few games.

24:20.128 --> 24:21.462
Who shot him?

24:21.496 --> 24:23.164
A local dope dealer.

24:24.766 --> 24:27.935
Roland saw something
he shouldn't have saw.

24:29.504 --> 24:31.922
Come on. Let's get out of here.

24:32.107 --> 24:34.909
All right, an eyewitness
saw an unidentified male

24:34.992 --> 24:37.745
flee from the scene,
toss an object into a dumpster.

24:37.779 --> 24:40.314
Detective Halstead
recovered that object one block

24:40.348 --> 24:42.516
from the scene...
a Glock, nine millimeter.

24:42.551 --> 24:44.118
- Ballistics?
- Same weapon used

24:44.152 --> 24:45.486
in the Eddie Greene homicide.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.021
- Prints?
- Negative.

24:47.055 --> 24:48.756
Does it connect back
to Kurtis Washington

24:48.790 --> 24:51.603
or Andre Walker or anyone
involved with this gang?

24:51.628 --> 24:54.361
No, it was stolen from a
registered owner in Wisconsin.

24:54.396 --> 24:56.697
No forensics, no witnesses...

24:56.731 --> 24:58.599
Yeah, I get it, but it all goes back

24:58.633 --> 25:00.468
to that undercover meeting with Ruzek,

25:00.502 --> 25:02.269
which we got on tape, by the way.

25:02.304 --> 25:03.604
Listen.

25:03.638 --> 25:06.507
Kurtis gets spooked, calls off the meet.

25:06.541 --> 25:09.543
Two hours later, Eddie gets
popped, two in the chest.

25:09.578 --> 25:11.445
The next day, the only eyewitness,

25:11.480 --> 25:14.181
his brother Roland,
gets popped two in the chest.

25:14.216 --> 25:16.217
Same weapon both hits.

25:16.251 --> 25:17.818
I'm with you.

25:17.853 --> 25:19.564
Kurtis is the shooter,
Andre drove the getaway car.

25:19.588 --> 25:21.322
Check, check. But...

25:21.356 --> 25:24.458
We still don't have enough
to move forward.

25:24.493 --> 25:26.026
I'm sorry, Hank.

25:59.294 --> 26:00.561
Any luck with the warrant?

26:00.595 --> 26:02.496
Nah, Valdez says we need more.

26:02.531 --> 26:04.064
- What else is new, right?
- Yep.

26:04.099 --> 26:06.400
Hey, how was that
parentteacher conference?

26:06.434 --> 26:07.768
It was great.

26:07.802 --> 26:10.104
Eva's doing really well.
Getting all A's.

26:10.138 --> 26:11.372
Tell her I said hey.

26:11.406 --> 26:13.274
Yeah.

26:13.308 --> 26:14.441
- Adam.
- Yeah?

26:14.476 --> 26:16.177
Give me a second.

26:16.211 --> 26:18.279
What's up, boss?

26:18.313 --> 26:20.247
Got a call about you this morning.

26:20.282 --> 26:22.249
Someone saw you punch Andre Walker.

26:22.284 --> 26:25.219
That someone filed a beef.

26:25.253 --> 26:27.486
IAD's opened an official investigation.

26:27.511 --> 26:30.024
Boss, this prick Andre,
he was pushing his luck...

26:30.058 --> 26:32.800
Stop talking now.

26:35.897 --> 26:39.733
An active resister refused
to comply with your orders.

26:39.768 --> 26:42.102
He tried to overpower you.

26:42.145 --> 26:44.646
In order to protect yourself
and others, you used

26:44.673 --> 26:47.541
physical force to regain
control of the situation.

26:47.576 --> 26:49.109
All right, copy that.

26:49.144 --> 26:52.246
As to Upton, that's on you.

26:52.280 --> 26:54.548
All right.

27:04.993 --> 27:06.327
Hey.

27:06.361 --> 27:07.962
Spilled coffee.

27:07.996 --> 27:10.631
Memo to self...
invent a lid that doesn't drip.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.933
Hey, so, listen,
that thing from yesterday...

27:12.968 --> 27:15.002
it's become a little bit of a situation.

27:15.036 --> 27:17.071
Somebody saw what happened,
they filed a report,

27:17.105 --> 27:18.639
Now I got a CR to deal with.

27:18.673 --> 27:20.318
I just wanna make sure you
and I are on the same page.

27:20.342 --> 27:22.276
Same page.

27:22.310 --> 27:24.578
I know you know what I mean.

27:27.497 --> 27:29.064
I'm gonna have to think about it.

27:31.820 --> 27:33.988
Just shooting straight, man.

27:34.022 --> 27:36.123
There's iPhones and cameras everywhere.

27:36.157 --> 27:38.826
It's not so easy
to just make up a lie anymore.

27:38.860 --> 27:40.461
And I know a lot of good coppers

27:40.495 --> 27:41.538
that have been stripped
for falsifying...

27:41.562 --> 27:43.596
No, you do what you gotta do, Upton.

27:43.898 --> 27:45.299
Hey.

27:45.333 --> 27:46.999
Caught a break.
Found some surveillance footage

27:47.023 --> 27:48.613
from a camera about a block
away from the mini mart.

27:48.637 --> 27:50.429
Thanks, man.

27:56.144 --> 27:57.878
That is Kurtis, no doubt.

27:57.912 --> 28:00.147
That's 'cause you know it's him.

28:00.181 --> 28:02.149
If you're in a jury,
that's a skinny man,

28:02.183 --> 28:03.334
black, wearing a hoodie.

28:03.359 --> 28:04.626
All right, let me play with it,

28:04.651 --> 28:06.252
see if I can get a better angle.

28:10.566 --> 28:12.034
Well, there's the gun.

28:12.059 --> 28:13.619
All right, play it again, regular size.

28:17.198 --> 28:19.466
All right, hold it. Stop. See that?

28:19.501 --> 28:20.901
There's someone else there.

28:20.935 --> 28:23.003
Yeah, probably Andre being a lookout.

28:23.038 --> 28:24.471
Let me mess with it. Hold up.

28:26.665 --> 28:29.476
Yeah, all I can make out is his sneaker.

28:46.361 --> 28:48.228
Straight up.

28:48.263 --> 28:51.941
You saw the face of the man who
threw the gun in the dumpster.

28:53.201 --> 28:54.779
Yes.

28:55.303 --> 28:58.490
If I showed you photos,
you can identify the guy?

28:59.274 --> 29:01.008
I mean, I can, but...

29:02.877 --> 29:05.279
Bro, look what happened to Roland.

29:05.313 --> 29:06.547
Look what happened to him.

29:06.581 --> 29:08.015
I mean, he winded up dead, dude.

29:08.049 --> 29:09.732
People hate snitches and you know that.

29:09.757 --> 29:11.991
I understand that, but that's
not gonna happen to you, okay?

29:12.015 --> 29:13.187
I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.780
I mean, I know you wouldn't
but it still could.

29:24.599 --> 29:27.109
What do you want me to do?

29:31.072 --> 29:33.890
First of all, you didn't
do anything wrong, Jordan.

29:34.809 --> 29:37.211
So, as far as I'm concerned,
you're not a snitch.

29:37.245 --> 29:38.677
You're brave.

29:39.013 --> 29:41.415
You're willing to help put away
a man who did a bad thing

29:41.480 --> 29:42.810
to a very good person, so...

29:43.785 --> 29:46.146
All I want you to do
is have selfrespect.

29:46.995 --> 29:49.504
I want you to be able
to look in the mirror

29:49.758 --> 29:51.825
every day for the rest of your life

29:51.960 --> 29:55.059
and know that you did the
right thing when it mattered.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.467
That's all I want.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.580
You all good, right?

30:16.614 --> 30:17.581
Yeah.

30:17.615 --> 30:18.749
Yeah.

30:18.783 --> 30:20.551
Jordan.

30:20.585 --> 30:22.252
Hi, Jordan.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.322
I'm Anna Valdez; I'm with
the State's Attorney's office.

30:25.366 --> 30:26.833
Your brother told me you saw

30:26.858 --> 30:29.927
someone toss a gun into a dumpster.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.063
Yeah.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.032
I heard gunshots, and...

30:35.057 --> 30:37.192
Then this man came out of the store,

30:37.235 --> 30:40.671
and threw a gun into
this big, green dumpster.

30:43.308 --> 30:44.942
Finally caught a lucky break.

30:46.516 --> 30:49.346
Hey, let's get you
set up in here, all right?

30:49.381 --> 30:51.181
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

30:53.947 --> 30:55.790
Hey.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.899
You sure about all this?

31:00.425 --> 31:01.925
No.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.627
Why the hell are you doing it?

31:03.661 --> 31:05.462
Because it's the right thing to do.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.964
Forget what's right.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.826
You do what's best
for you and your family.

31:08.851 --> 31:10.843
That's what's right.

31:12.726 --> 31:15.539
Yeah. Appreciate it.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.555
Okay, if you see the man

31:18.580 --> 31:21.682
who tossed the gun into the
dumpster, just say so, okay?

31:23.515 --> 31:25.086
No.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.389
Yeah.

31:42.524 --> 31:44.162
Him.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.140
Thank you, Jordan.

31:50.175 --> 31:52.609
Type up the warrant.
I'll get in touch with the duty judge.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.014
Proud of you, Jordan.

32:37.589 --> 32:39.724
5021 Charlie, 101, 101.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.693
Shots fired at the police. Male, black.

32:41.718 --> 32:43.216
Hoofing it down the alley.

32:43.241 --> 32:45.991
<i>Copy that, 5021 Charlie. Shots fired.</i>

33:08.280 --> 33:10.249
Stop!

33:23.674 --> 33:27.170
Offender just ran into an alley
off of Loomis, headed west.

33:43.321 --> 33:44.794
Pick it up.

33:48.585 --> 33:50.352
Pick it up.

33:52.505 --> 33:54.149
Please, pick it up.

34:10.415 --> 34:11.815
Kevin.

34:14.786 --> 34:17.454
He might have another
weapon on his ankle.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.322
Be careful.

34:28.032 --> 34:30.000
It's all right, Kevin, I got you.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.837
Stand down.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.306
Get up.

34:45.030 --> 34:47.947
You're under arrest for
the murder of Roland Garrett.

34:52.389 --> 34:53.623
Let's go.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.463
Come on.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.267
Have I ever told you
you're faster than you look?

35:17.301 --> 35:18.802
You think I'm overweight?

35:18.836 --> 35:20.804
Dude, I needed this.

35:21.193 --> 35:23.361
Thanks, man.
You did a hell of a job today.

35:23.386 --> 35:24.353
Hey, appreciate that.

35:24.387 --> 35:26.549
- Buy you a drink?
- Not this time.

35:26.574 --> 35:28.970
I think I should probably take
Vinessa and Jordan to dinner.

35:28.995 --> 35:31.456
- Fair enough.
- Congratulations.

35:31.564 --> 35:33.999
I hear you boys had a nice pinch today.

35:34.025 --> 35:35.292
Appreciate that.

35:35.327 --> 35:36.872
Long way to walk for an attaboy.

35:36.897 --> 35:39.638
Nah. Need the exercise.

35:39.663 --> 35:41.103
All this sitting around can actually

35:41.133 --> 35:43.200
shorten your life span by 20%.

35:44.903 --> 35:48.005
But, there is
something we need to discuss.

35:48.039 --> 35:49.507
In private.

35:49.541 --> 35:51.776
Okay. After you.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.377
- Congratulations.
- Sir.

35:53.412 --> 35:54.655
I'll see you guys in the morning.

35:54.679 --> 35:56.213
Thanks, boss. Have a good night.

35:56.248 --> 35:58.849
- Molly's?
- Yes.

35:58.884 --> 36:01.452
Tofu chicken.

36:01.486 --> 36:04.288
Chinese medicine.

36:04.322 --> 36:06.123
Twitter.

36:07.859 --> 36:09.960
I'm not sure where you're
going with this, Denny,

36:09.995 --> 36:12.496
but I am intrigued.

36:12.531 --> 36:16.500
I am just listing
a few things that I'm guessing

36:16.535 --> 36:18.402
you think are ridiculous.

36:18.437 --> 36:19.970
So far, so good.

36:21.706 --> 36:24.175
I got one more for you too.

36:24.209 --> 36:26.612
Police reform.

36:29.124 --> 36:30.258
You know your man Rowzek?

36:30.305 --> 36:31.772
Ruzek.

36:33.275 --> 36:36.110
The case we filed
the other day just went away.

36:36.311 --> 36:38.612
Seems the only witness,
a young woman named

36:38.637 --> 36:42.528
Yvonne Wallace, changed her mind.

36:44.486 --> 36:46.253
It's news to me.

36:48.132 --> 36:49.527
Is that right?

36:51.993 --> 36:54.627
You know, it's always better
to cooperate up front, Hank,

36:54.652 --> 36:57.464
when it's just a conversation
between two old friends.

36:57.499 --> 37:00.895
Otherwise things can get more formal.

37:01.403 --> 37:03.613
More contentious.

37:04.506 --> 37:06.988
Like I said, I don't know.

37:12.747 --> 37:15.302
You ever read a book called
"The Prince"?

37:15.517 --> 37:21.770
Written by a cat named
Machiavelli back in the 1500s.

37:22.028 --> 37:24.067
I haven't read that one.

37:24.526 --> 37:26.801
Well, me either.

37:26.995 --> 37:30.215
But there's one hell
of a quote in that book.

37:30.699 --> 37:33.180
Goes something like...

37:34.269 --> 37:37.071
If you aim at the king,

37:38.665 --> 37:41.675
you better make damn sure
you kill his ass.

37:45.113 --> 37:46.452
Yeah.

37:46.548 --> 37:49.327
Yeah, I am familiar with that one.

37:51.563 --> 37:53.461
See...

37:55.557 --> 37:57.906
The thing is, Denny,

37:58.893 --> 38:01.242
I never took aim at you.

38:01.896 --> 38:04.638
You only think I did.

38:06.735 --> 38:08.809
I'm pretty sure that's
what lawyers would call

38:08.834 --> 38:11.438
"a distinction without a difference."

38:23.293 --> 38:25.261
Have a good night, Hank.

38:31.960 --> 38:33.460
To Eddie Greene.

38:33.495 --> 38:35.122
And to Jordan Atwater.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.115
Yeah.

38:37.218 --> 38:38.852
That kid's got guts.

38:38.933 --> 38:41.735
Testifying, going against some
ridiculous ingrained code...

38:41.770 --> 38:43.637
It's not easy.

38:43.672 --> 38:46.240
What are you really saying, Hailey?

38:46.274 --> 38:47.608
Not the time, man.

38:47.642 --> 38:49.076
It's not the time? No, it's right.

38:49.110 --> 38:51.278
I think it's the perfect time.
Just say it.

38:51.312 --> 38:52.746
All right.

38:53.782 --> 38:55.086
Just let it go, man.

38:55.111 --> 38:56.244
Let it go.

38:56.269 --> 38:58.103
Hey, Hailey, look.

38:58.609 --> 39:00.077
If you're gonna throw me under the bus,

39:00.101 --> 39:02.089
just give me a heads up?

39:02.123 --> 39:04.158
I took care of it.

39:04.192 --> 39:05.993
- What do you mean?
- Case went away.

39:06.027 --> 39:08.225
It just went away?

39:08.663 --> 39:10.130
I found the witness.

39:10.165 --> 39:12.666
I talked to her.
She agreed to recant her story.

39:12.701 --> 39:15.189
She just agreed just like that?

39:15.303 --> 39:17.322
I didn't say that.

39:19.307 --> 39:20.689
Thank you.

39:22.574 --> 39:24.884
I didn't do it for you.

39:29.384 --> 39:31.390
Copy that.

39:33.321 --> 39:35.117
So I...

39:35.657 --> 39:37.591
I ran that...

39:40.028 --> 39:42.296
Plate you were asking about.

39:42.330 --> 39:43.597
Antonio's friend?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.687
Yeah.

39:45.834 --> 39:48.335
He's a State's Attorney.

39:48.503 --> 39:51.803
A guy named Nathan Potter.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.440
Rising star.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.827
But...

39:58.413 --> 40:00.682
Word is...

40:01.316 --> 40:03.854
He's done a lot of work with your pal,

40:04.419 --> 40:06.408
Denny Woods.

40:09.090 --> 40:11.358
You don't think Antonio's...

40:14.362 --> 40:17.664
The morning I saw him
with this prosecutor Potter...

40:17.699 --> 40:19.748
he lied.

40:20.193 --> 40:23.329
He told me he was at some
parentteacher conference.

40:29.911 --> 40:32.226
This much I know.

40:32.413 --> 40:34.991
They're coming after us, Al.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.655
From all sides.

40:38.253 --> 40:40.554
Yeah.

40:53.067 --> 40:54.868
You coming to the game this Wednesday?

40:54.903 --> 40:57.571
'Cause you know I'm getting
some play time with varsity.

40:57.605 --> 41:00.374
It's gonna be crazy. It's gonna be hype.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.154
And I'm really excited for the showcase.

41:08.283 --> 41:09.449
Wait.

41:09.484 --> 41:11.618
Kev, can we get some dessert?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.222
Yeah.

41:15.256 --> 41:16.557
Go for it.

41:30.104 --> 41:32.105
Do they have milkshakes?

41:53.294 --> 41:55.326
You jumpy?

41:55.351 --> 41:56.467
I'm good, I'm good.

41:56.492 --> 41:58.662
- Little scared there, Kevin?
- Not bad.

41:58.687 --> 42:00.434
All right, I'm getting ice cream.

42:00.468 --> 42:04.539
Ice cream with some chocolate sauce.

42:04.973 --> 42:06.773
Banana pudding. You wanna share with me?

42:06.808 --> 42:08.575
I only had it once, it was...

42:11.147 --> 42:16.147
