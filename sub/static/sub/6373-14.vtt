Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:06.363
- Betty's busy. Can I take a message?
- Yes, tell her she can call me.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.532
- I will.
- I wanted to give you this.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.305
You just don't know
what this means to me.

00:12.379 --> 00:16.372
If I didn't want to be a seamstress
my whole life, what would I have to do?

00:16.449 --> 00:20.215
Drop this off at the nearest
police station. Anonymously.

00:20.286 --> 00:22.686
I don't really think of
Alex as being gone.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.156
- How did he...?
- Jumped out of a helicopter

00:25.225 --> 00:26.556
to ski down Mount Juno.

00:26.626 --> 00:30.619
Looks like that skiing accident
really paid off...

00:30.697 --> 00:34.258
...Alex Meade.
- "Alexis," darling.

00:35.935 --> 00:37.562
It's "Alexis" now.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.075
<i>[Speaking Spanish on TV]</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:56.815
- Morning, Betty.
- Hi, Dad.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.085
<i>- [electronic beeping]
- Betty Suarez.</i>

01:00.794 --> 01:02.762
I know. I named you.

01:02.829 --> 01:07.391
<i>Shh. No. It's Fashion Week. Daniel's
in charge of the Mode show, it's crazy.</i>

01:07.467 --> 01:10.197
No, he asked for black tablecloths.

01:10.937 --> 01:13.872
- Napkins, oh...
- Silver. Black will make them pop.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.999
Silver napkins. Thank you.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.443
- What is Fashion Week?
- "What's Fashion Week?"

01:19.512 --> 01:21.776
The most important
event in the industry.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.442
When buyers get their
first look at the fall lines.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.042
Am I going to have to explain
couture again?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.486
- Please don't.
- Betty Suarez!

01:29.556 --> 01:32.753
Eat your pancake on the train.
I'll pack your breakfast to go.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.454
No, leave the seating chart to me,
I'm on my way!

01:36.329 --> 01:39.298
[Hilda] Oh, sure.
She gets a job right away.

01:39.365 --> 01:42.425
Yesterday she was a nun,
today she's wearing pasties.

01:42.502 --> 01:45.130
You're gonna find
a job soon. You'll see.

01:45.205 --> 01:47.196
<i>Oh, hey, what about Mode?</i>

01:47.273 --> 01:51.733
They hiring any help
for this, um, fashion thing?

01:51.811 --> 01:55.542
"Fashion Week!"
What is wrong with this family?

01:55.615 --> 01:59.210
Hilda, I really want to help out,
but we're just... we're filled up.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.784
- [Ignacio] Here.
- Thank you.

02:03.490 --> 02:05.617
Isn't there anything for your sister?

02:05.692 --> 02:09.219
We can't work together. You remember
the Lemon Ice King disaster?

02:09.294 --> 02:12.731
- She doesn't listen to me!
- That was a long time ago.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.632
- It wasn't her fault.
- She refused to wear a hairnet,

02:15.702 --> 02:19.365
that man choked on her bobby pin
and I was the one who got fired!

02:19.439 --> 02:22.931
Look, I love her,
but it's not a good fit. Betty Suarez.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.708
Thank you for calling back.
It's Victoria Beckham.

02:26.779 --> 02:28.303
You're talking to Posh?

02:28.381 --> 02:30.941
No, but I'm talking to
the people who talk to her.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.678
Betty rules.

02:36.956 --> 02:41.655
- Daniel, I want to talk to you.
- Great, another scotch lecture.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.787
I've been thinking about your brother.

02:43.863 --> 02:47.355
So this where you tell me
what a disappointment I've been, right?

02:47.433 --> 02:50.163
How I'll never fill Alex's shoes?

02:50.703 --> 02:53.797
Alex died two years ago.
This is about you.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.808
You've really proven yourself
these past few months.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.936
One day, Meade Publications
is going to be in your hands.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.538
Right, Dad. Whatever you say.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.883
I mean it.

03:05.952 --> 03:09.911
Tomorrow, after the show, I plan on
announcing my intentions to the press.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.754
Thank you.

03:15.728 --> 03:17.355
I'm proud of you, son.

Hi, sailor.

Booking a cruise? You can't afford to
cruise the bathroom on the 17th floor.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.378
- I have some money coming in.
- From where?

03:36.449 --> 03:40.408
None of your business. Is there someone
with a cold sore you could make fun of?

03:40.486 --> 03:43.114
Oh, come on. Spill. It's me!

03:43.189 --> 03:44.918
We share lip gloss.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.486
You know every year the "it" item
comes out of Fashion Week?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.156
Hello, wide belt, 2006.

03:52.232 --> 03:56.532
And you know how every year Eternal 18
has an exact knock-off of "it,"

03:56.603 --> 03:59.003
mere days later?

04:00.673 --> 04:04.700
Who do you think tips
them off for a big old bag of cash?

04:04.777 --> 04:09.237
What? You've been selling your integrity
to some tacky mall store?

04:10.216 --> 04:11.649
Genius! Count me in!

04:11.718 --> 04:14.812
Forget it, Clyde.
Find your own criminal activity.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.986

<i>- Buon giorno, peon!
- Oh, no, Fabia, you cannot just go...</i>

Ah.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.125
I love your assistant.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.067
I have the same one in beige.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.628
Fabia. I didn't know
you were in the building.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.867
I can usually smell you from the lobby.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.810
Well, you know, seeing that Fabia
donated $20,000 in cosmetics

04:39.879 --> 04:41.813
for the fashion show gift bag...

04:41.881 --> 04:43.405
[kissing]

04:43.483 --> 04:45.644
I figure you take Fabia to lunch, no?

04:45.718 --> 04:49.518
Oh, darling, I would love to,
but I can't, I'm swamped.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.887
Not to mention,
I'm getting a promotion.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.758
It's still a hush-hush, but you are
looking at the soon-to-be crowned

04:55.828 --> 04:57.955
<i>Editor-in-Chief of Mode.</i>

04:58.031 --> 05:00.966

- [Screaming]

05:03.836 --> 05:05.497
That dress!

05:07.240 --> 05:09.538
- Is it Eduardo?
- Yes.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.577
I'm wearing it to the show tomorrow.

05:11.644 --> 05:15.512
I went to Eduardo's studio,
and he promised this dress to me!

05:15.581 --> 05:19.779
I even make for my Picchu
a matching ensemble!

05:19.852 --> 05:22.946
Well, call Eduardo
and see if he has another one.

05:23.022 --> 05:26.321
Don't be stupid!
What are we, the freaking Olsen twins?

05:26.959 --> 05:29.792
Fine. Have it your way.

05:29.862 --> 05:33.457
Perhaps it will look better in a plus
size anyway. Come on, baby, we go!

05:33.533 --> 05:37.435
Oh, Fabia, silly,
little delusional Fabia.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.701
I'm sure you and your little bitch
will look fabulous in anything.

05:41.774 --> 05:44.743
Look at that face, it is flawless.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.975
My God, it is flawless.
Who did your eyes? Shapiro?

05:49.048 --> 05:50.811
Fabia's had no work done.

05:51.384 --> 05:52.373
Please.

05:52.452 --> 05:56.479
There's enough leftover skin from
your surgeries to make a bed for my cat.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.151
For your information, this no surgery.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.057
This duck sauce.

06:02.862 --> 06:06.389
- Excuse me?
- The sauce from a man duck...

06:06.466 --> 06:08.900
...that makes the baby duck.

06:08.968 --> 06:13.132
I had a doctor,
a Dr. Wong on Spring Street,

06:13.206 --> 06:17.836
he give me the injection
into my face and poof, ten years gone.

06:17.910 --> 06:21.903
- And you could look 65 again.
- As lovely as that sounds,

06:21.981 --> 06:25.508
I'm a few years away from having
a duck quack off in my face.

06:28.321 --> 06:31.085
Whatever you say...

06:32.358 --> 06:34.417
...Wrinkle-mina.

Come on, baby.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.728
Marc!

06:43.803 --> 06:46.203
Dr. Wong, Spring Street, I'm on it!

06:50.943 --> 06:54.435
- Um, I think I ordered a smaller size.
- For who?

06:54.514 --> 06:55.776
You could wash it...

06:56.449 --> 06:58.917
...like a few thousand times.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.410
Henry... hi.

07:03.523 --> 07:06.356
- How've you been?
- Oh, good. Busy.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.194
<i>I hear you're working on the Mode show.</i>

07:09.262 --> 07:12.322
They must've liked how you
pulled off the Christmas party.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.730
Listen, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

07:14.801 --> 07:17.531
- [Hilda] Betty!
- Oh, my God!

07:19.105 --> 07:22.165
- Hi!
- Hilda, what are you doing here?

07:22.241 --> 07:23.572
I am recovering.

07:23.643 --> 07:26.476
Oprah told me that I need to
take control of my life,

07:26.546 --> 07:29.743
and then Dr. Phil told me that
I need to take on a challenge,

07:29.816 --> 07:33.343
and then Rachael Ray made a pie.
Anyway, the point is, I am back,

07:33.419 --> 07:35.512
and I need ten copies of my resume.

07:37.523 --> 07:42.586
Oh, hello, I'm Hilda.
I'm Betty's sister.

07:42.662 --> 07:45.563
- Henry. I think we spoke on the phone.
- When?

07:45.631 --> 07:46.962
Oh... So nice to meet you!

07:47.033 --> 07:50.002
- What? When did you talk...?
- Where's the Xerox machine?

07:50.069 --> 07:52.936
This is my job, you can't
walk in when you feel like it.

07:53.005 --> 07:56.873
- Is that your boss?
- The Xerox machine's over there.

07:56.943 --> 08:01.107
Daniel! How was your meeting
with your father?

08:01.180 --> 08:04.377
- Better than I thought.
- He didn't give you the "Alex speech?"

08:04.450 --> 08:08.011
No, he's finally seeing me as
an adult who can take responsibility...

08:08.087 --> 08:09.486
Brodeo!

08:10.490 --> 08:13.118
- Security!
- No, no, no, Betty, Betty...

08:13.192 --> 08:15.922
...this is my friend
I told you about, Becks.

08:15.995 --> 08:20.125
Oh! I'm so sorry.
The photojournalist. I'm Betty.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.531
We spoke on the phone
when you were in Africa.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.093
I heard all that growling
in the background.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.571
Yeah, she and I broke up.
[Chuckling]

08:27.640 --> 08:33.044
Listen, Betty, if Daniel ever gives you
a hard time, you let me know.

08:33.111 --> 08:37.014
I'll take him out back,
teach him some manners. Mm-hmm.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.640
OK.

08:39.885 --> 08:41.114
<i>[Electronic beeping]</i>

08:41.187 --> 08:42.313

08:42.822 --> 08:46.451
[Chuckling]
OK. Joke's over.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.391
Where's your real assistant?

08:48.461 --> 08:52.056
- Come on, Betty's a great girl.
- Maybe after a half dozen shots.

08:52.131 --> 08:55.760
- All right, all right.
- Look what I brought you from Africa.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.996
- What is it?
- An oshe Shango.

09:00.072 --> 09:03.940
- So, seriously, how was Africa?
- Oh, totally mind-blowing.

09:05.111 --> 09:08.774
Bullets flying, rebel attacks,
human suffering.

09:08.848 --> 09:10.338
Not a hottie to be found.

09:10.416 --> 09:13.180
They're thin, but it's that
sick thin, not hot thin.

09:13.252 --> 09:17.586
Culturally sensitive, as always.
So what brings you back?

09:17.657 --> 09:20.148
It's Fashion Week! The booty-lympics!

09:20.226 --> 09:22.387
Yeah, I know,
I can't do that this year.

09:22.461 --> 09:24.486
I'm the Editor-in-Chief, now.

09:24.564 --> 09:28.398
Do you have to talk like that
when you say "Editor-in-Chief?"

09:28.467 --> 09:30.560
- I do.
- Come on, this is our thing.

09:30.636 --> 09:34.766
I didn't travel halfway around the world
for you to turn into your father.

09:34.840 --> 09:37.308
Good thing is he is
treating me differently now.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.503
He's about to give me
keys to the kingdom.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.980
You didn't get tight-ass when
he gave you the keys to his Bentley,

09:43.049 --> 09:45.040
and we totaled that.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.415
- Yeah.
- I get it.

09:47.486 --> 09:51.513
You're just afraid I'm gonna bag
the hottest girl again.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.584
Becks... this week
isn't about that anymore.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.529
I have to keep my eyes on the clothes,
not the models wearing them.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.964
Wow.

10:01.033 --> 10:02.898
Do you pee sitting down now, too?

10:02.969 --> 10:04.960
[Both laughing]

10:08.207 --> 10:09.936
OK, thank you very much.

10:10.476 --> 10:12.205
I thought you said ten copies.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.577
Well, I must've hit
the zero button by accident... twice.

10:15.648 --> 10:18.242
- Ooh, pencils.
- No. No.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.809
Betty, get us a take-out menu
for the Japanese place downstairs?

10:21.887 --> 10:26.153
- Hey, Hilda. How are you?
- Oh, just making copies of my resume.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.386
- I need a job.
- Really?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.929
We could use some
more help for Fashion Week.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.328
Hook her up. I'll see you.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.792
Oh, my God!

10:35.868 --> 10:38.598
We're gonna be working together!
Hook me up?

10:38.671 --> 10:42.266
Well, it wouldn't be so much "together."
I'd be your boss.

10:42.341 --> 10:43.603
[Laughing]

10:43.676 --> 10:45.166
Yeah, right.

10:45.244 --> 10:47.735
You know, I don't think
that this is a good idea.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.077
What, are you kidding?
It's gonna be great!

10:50.149 --> 10:52.845
Lemon Ice Sisters, reunited!

10:52.918 --> 10:56.945

So I'm kind of having a rough day.

11:21.280 --> 11:24.044
It's not draping.
My first show, and it's not draping.

11:24.116 --> 11:26.516
- Right.
- It started out pretty decent.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.850
Cut to the chase, please?
You have 30 seconds. Go!

11:29.922 --> 11:32.015
Daniel hired Hilda for Fashion Week.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.889
She won't listen.
She's gonna take over like always.

11:34.960 --> 11:38.896
- Twenty seconds. Stop overreacting.
- You've never had an older sister.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.933
- Fifteen seconds.
- 1991, I win the science fair,

11:42.001 --> 11:44.469
she wins Miss Junior Teen Queens.
Who got a cake?

11:44.537 --> 11:48.029
1994, I come home with straight A's,

11:48.107 --> 11:50.302
Hilda comes home pregnant.
She gets a cake.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.005
- What, so this is about cake?
- It's about how she steals my thunder!

11:54.080 --> 11:56.378
<i>Here, at Mode, I'm Betty.</i>

11:56.449 --> 11:58.576
Everywhere else, I'm "Hilda's sister."

11:58.651 --> 12:02.815
<i>Betty, you were at Mode first. Here,
she's going to be "Betty's sister."</i>

12:02.888 --> 12:04.856
Hmm. That isn't so bad.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.950
Oh, bollocks. These designs are awful.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.188
No, they're not. Thank you.

They're going to steal the show,

Christina, you are amazing.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.103
You have to say that, you're my friend.

Wilhelmina isn't, she would have never
picked you if you didn't have talent.

12:30.616 --> 12:33.779
Yeah, well, Wilhelmina
picked me because...

12:35.588 --> 12:38.318
Well, we'll find out
soon enough, won't we?

12:40.659 --> 12:42.923
You need to fill this out
and send it back.

12:42.995 --> 12:44.895
Wait. I filled this out last week.

12:44.964 --> 12:49.401
You did? Oh. I guess you did.

12:49.468 --> 12:53.234
- You need to fill out this one.
- And this one, too?

12:53.305 --> 12:56.968
- You didn't turn them in?
- I'm sorry. I'm a little distracted.

My, um... it's not important.

Well, are you sure that these'll be
ready in time for my... court date?

Of course. I'm a professional.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.918
Do you want to... talk about anything?

13:14.994 --> 13:16.894
No, I'm fine.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.892
He dumped me.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.161
- Who?
- My boyfriend, Toussaint.

13:23.235 --> 13:26.762
He's a dog. I mean, who dumps somebody
this close to Valentine's Day?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.934
And I already bought him
some chocolates.

13:42.188 --> 13:45.487
Constance, you're a terrific woman.

13:46.258 --> 13:49.250
You'll find someone else
to give your chocolates to.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.862
Oh, Ignacio... you're so sweet.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.029
Why can't all men be like you?

Ignacio...

Can you believe it's finally here?

14:05.044 --> 14:07.171
Everything we've worked for.

14:07.246 --> 14:11.683
By this time tomorrow, Daniel and
Bradford will be as out as Ugg boots.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.843
I can't wait.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.683
I think I'm gonna get there
a little early tomorrow.

14:16.755 --> 14:19.383
What? That's not what we planned.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.757
I want to mingle. Besides,
I never got to go to my own funeral.

14:24.230 --> 14:27.722
I want to know what the world
really thought of Alex Meade.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.291
- Especially my brother.
- It's risky.

I will see you tomorrow.

Bring on the duck, Dr. Wong.

- What did you do?
- You like?

15:04.336 --> 15:07.066
- It was kind of boring.
- It was kind of our uniform.

15:07.139 --> 15:10.768
It still says "Mode." Or "ode."

15:10.843 --> 15:12.970
Whatever.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.673
You work the fashion show, not be in it.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.376
Your only job is hanging
and steaming clothes.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.680
Yeah. They're gonna
pay me in cash, right?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.948

OK, here's how this
is going to work, ladies.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.298
- You two are taking me to Fashion Week.
- Justin...

15:33.365 --> 15:36.129
No argument! I've been
waiting for this my whole life.

15:36.201 --> 15:39.898
I did my homework, called in sick
to school, you have to sign this slip.

15:39.972 --> 15:43.135
- If you think for a second I...
- I swear, Mom, I will run away.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.608
I know a kid in the sixth grade
that sells crack.

15:49.181 --> 15:52.981
OK, all right.
Why don't we just bring Dad, too?

Karl Lagerfeld. We love you.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.247
A ponytail at seventy? Brave.

16:30.356 --> 16:34.986
I did catch a glimpse of Zac Posen's
line and the construction was excellent.

- See that redhead with the pair of...

16:39.231 --> 16:42.758
We talked about this. I'm going to
see you after Fashion Week. Right?

16:42.835 --> 16:46.464
Fine. Less competition.
More meow for me.

16:46.538 --> 16:50.474
Go. Enjoy yourself.
Ask the Russian models for ID this time.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.010
Oh, come on, give me an hour.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.445
You know you want to. Our usual bet?

16:56.515 --> 16:59.541
Whoever scores with
the hottest girl here wins...

17:00.219 --> 17:01.709
...one dollar.

Heidi Klum and Seal! And baby Seal!

17:59.111 --> 18:01.306

- OK.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.972
Oh, my God! J. Lo!

18:03.048 --> 18:05.881
Hilda! You're supposed to be
in the wardrobe tent.

18:05.951 --> 18:07.782
- Give me the camera!
- Give it back!

18:07.853 --> 18:10.014
- I'm your supervisor.
- I will sit on you.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.182
We're not home.
Try and act like an adult.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.725
Now go find something to steam. Go on.

18:26.305 --> 18:29.468
How bad is it? Honest?

18:30.509 --> 18:32.374
Not that bad at all!

18:32.444 --> 18:36.141
A little cover up and some
hemorrhoid cream for the swelling,

18:36.215 --> 18:37.705
and you're good to go!

18:37.783 --> 18:41.583
It's getting worse by the minute!
I can't see a thing!

18:42.121 --> 18:44.385
It's a blessing, Willie! Think about it.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.391
Fashion Week. All those people
you don't want to see.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.620
But they have to see me.

18:49.695 --> 18:52.129
And you will be by my side at all times.

so distant lately, you know?

19:29.601 --> 19:31.626
She's always busy with work stuff.

It's Fashion Week, when the buyers get
their first looks at the fall couture.

- I don't like nuts.

that phone call from? Guadalajara?

25:05.704 --> 25:08.400
<i>I left a message to see if
you wanted to watch Rudolph.</i>

25:08.473 --> 25:12.910
- What? You left me a message? Where?
- At your house.

25:12.978 --> 25:16.880
- Hilda never told you?
- No! She didn't.

25:16.948 --> 25:19.109
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

25:19.184 --> 25:21.243
To become an only child.

25:29.961 --> 25:34.694
- Hey, Wilhelmina, love the hat!
- Oh, thank you.

25:34.766 --> 25:37.166
Do we know this person?

25:37.235 --> 25:40.227
<i>Kayla Brooks, fashion correspondent
for New York One.</i>

25:40.305 --> 25:43.832
She's in midnight-blue Chanel,
pewter buttons, navy stockings.

25:43.909 --> 25:46.469
- Mistake?
- Colossal. She looks like a mailbox.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.842
You're good, Jason.

25:47.913 --> 25:51.314
It's "Justin," but you can call me
whatever you want. I love you.

25:56.187 --> 25:58.781
What am I supposed to do?
Club her and strip her?

25:58.857 --> 26:01.690
Take her into a port-a-potty
and seduce her out of it.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.558
Have we met? OK. I'll club her.

26:04.629 --> 26:08.224
For God's sake, Dorothy, do you want
to go to Man-tasy Island or not?

26:08.667 --> 26:09.895
Be a man!

26:11.603 --> 26:15.039
Well, it was my first time
drinking mescal.

26:15.106 --> 26:17.438
- I didn't know it was a worm.
- Excuse me.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.807
Hilda! Did you take a message from...

26:21.413 --> 26:23.005
What're you doing?

26:23.081 --> 26:26.380
- How do I do that hair flip?
- In a second, Kay.

26:26.451 --> 26:29.113
I'm helping out.
Christina asked me to.

26:29.187 --> 26:32.623
- But this is not your job.
- Hilda, I need your help.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.285
Eat a carrot stick, I'm talking here.

26:35.360 --> 26:39.763
They were short-handed and they needed
somebody with a background in big hair,

26:39.831 --> 26:43.062
so, come on,
who knows better than me?

26:43.134 --> 26:45.762
Betty, I'm really liking it here!

26:45.837 --> 26:48.431
Maybe I could turn this
into a full-time thing.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.906
No! No, you shouldn't even be here.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.967
- Give me this, I'll do it.
- Yeah, you?

26:53.044 --> 26:54.909
You can't even do your own hair.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.710
This is not our bathroom.
Don't talk to me like that.

26:57.782 --> 27:00.307
You are giving her a wind tunnel!

27:00.385 --> 27:01.511
[Both gasping]

27:06.625 --> 27:08.650
Sorry.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.528
OK. All right. Enough.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.101
<i>The Hilda Show is over!</i>

27:17.168 --> 27:19.227
- Go home.
- What?

27:19.304 --> 27:20.498
You're fired!

27:27.479 --> 27:29.208
Am I done?

27:31.016 --> 27:34.315
So what brings you to Fashion Week?
Are you in the industry?

27:34.386 --> 27:37.150
Not yet. But I'm hoping
to make a big splash.

27:37.656 --> 27:42.252
Sorry to interrupt, here's the coffee
I promised, so many fires to be put out.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.523
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. You have a lot to worry about.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.859
I'm fine.

27:46.931 --> 27:50.367
Will you excuse me a minute?
Hey, Betty! What's going on?

27:50.435 --> 27:53.370
Nothing. It's over now. Don't worry.

27:53.438 --> 27:57.306
I have to go check on
Christina and the gift bags.

27:57.375 --> 28:01.038
I dumped a lot on your lap this week,
but you're doing a great job.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.808
No. Daniel, I am out of my league here.

28:03.882 --> 28:05.747
Listen, when I started this job,

28:05.817 --> 28:09.548
who was the secretary from Queens
who saved the Fabia account?

28:09.621 --> 28:11.486
- Me.
- And who took all the credit?

28:11.556 --> 28:14.582
- You.
- When you get praised for the show,

28:14.659 --> 28:16.991
- who's gonna get the credit?
- You.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.360
No, you! I'm gonna make sure of it.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.991
You just...
You really gotta try and enjoy this.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.398
This is incredible.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.101
I have to go. Find something to do!

28:29.174 --> 28:31.142
Come on, we are on a deadline!

28:31.743 --> 28:34.712
Sorry. My assistant's
been having a rough day.

28:34.779 --> 28:37.304
You are not the Daniel Meade
I'd thought you'd be.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.408
Really? Who are you
getting your information from?

28:41.086 --> 28:43.554
Daniel, I have a little
confession to make.

28:43.621 --> 28:46.886
- OK.
- Your brother...

28:48.460 --> 28:49.722
Yeah?

28:51.529 --> 28:53.053
I used to date him.

29:03.708 --> 29:07.371
You... OK...
You can do this.

29:07.445 --> 29:10.471
She is a model.
Shiny things confuse her.

29:10.582 --> 29:14.882
OK, now, just flirt with her,
maybe even kiss her,

29:14.953 --> 29:17.513
and that bunny skirt
will hop right off her.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.920
OK, OK!

29:18.990 --> 29:23.086
But if this is anything like my prom
night, you're paying for the therapy.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.651
Wait! Come back.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.088
Go! Go, go!

29:31.002 --> 29:33.334
The brother Alex
talked about wouldn't care

29:33.404 --> 29:35.565
what kind of day
his assistant was having.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.609
Yeah, well, things change, right?
People change.

29:38.676 --> 29:41.008
- Yes, they do, Danny.
- Thank you for coming.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.604
- Thank you. Good luck with the show.
- Thank you.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.581
It's actually Daniel.

29:45.650 --> 29:48.278
My brother's the only one
who called me Danny.

29:48.353 --> 29:50.753
Do you miss him?

29:50.822 --> 29:53.882
We had a complicated relationship.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.887
Competitive. I mean,
you know how he was.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.692
To be honest, it might sound
a little weird, but...

30:01.399 --> 30:04.960
...it's kind of a relief to finally
be out from under his shadow.

30:05.036 --> 30:09.837
Oh, I think you're still
standing in it, Danny.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.707
- I've got a little secret for you.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

30:20.752 --> 30:22.310
What?

30:23.488 --> 30:26.150
- What are you talking about?
- Look into my eyes.

30:26.224 --> 30:28.283
The only thing they couldn't change.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.486
Is this some kind of sick joke?

30:30.562 --> 30:33.656
- Did Becks put you up to this?
- Remember Tia Petroni?

30:33.731 --> 30:36.791
The weekend in Vegas
I got a little... crazy?

30:45.877 --> 30:48.437
Ready for the show, Danny?

30:55.587 --> 30:58.556
<i>[Emcee] Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.</i>

30:59.357 --> 31:01.689
Where is Daniel? Unbelievable.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.421
He should be here.
He knows how important this is.

31:04.495 --> 31:07.931
I just saw him, he must've... Uh...

31:07.999 --> 31:09.796
I'll find him.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.530
You're crazy. How could you do this?

31:12.604 --> 31:14.663
I mean, I can't even look at you!

31:14.739 --> 31:17.333
Don't look at me.
I need you to know why I did this.

31:17.408 --> 31:19.273
- Since I was five...
- Don't.

31:19.344 --> 31:22.472
Since I was five, I felt like I was
dropped in the wrong skin.

31:22.547 --> 31:26.643
- This is about correcting a mistake.
- Oh, is that all it is? Really?

31:26.718 --> 31:29.243
That's the fast version.

31:29.320 --> 31:32.084
I wanted to talk to you
before I went through with it.

31:32.156 --> 31:35.455
- I didn't have an opportunity.
- Just stop. I can't breathe.

31:37.328 --> 31:41.731
You have no idea what you put the family
through! We thought you were dead, Alex!

31:41.799 --> 31:44.632
Mom had to bury her son!
She's never recovered.

31:44.702 --> 31:47.830
- And our father, he's...
- What? Moved on?

31:49.107 --> 31:50.404
I've noticed.

31:50.475 --> 31:52.534
Nobody's moved on, Alex.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.943
We think about you every single day.

31:56.014 --> 31:57.447
It's Alexis.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.208
And, by the way,

32:02.287 --> 32:06.053
hitting on your dead brother's
old girlfriend? Classy.

32:11.262 --> 32:14.789
Yeah, yeah, I'm just coming off
a pretty bad break-up myself,

32:14.866 --> 32:18.461
so if you're looking
for a little uh-uh-uh...

32:18.536 --> 32:20.163
...rebound action...

32:21.105 --> 32:24.199
- I'm looking for my shoes.
- Black platform peep-toes?

32:24.275 --> 32:25.299
Fabulous!

32:26.177 --> 32:28.611
Oh, I see now.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.706
They're hiding the good stuff back here.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.817
No, no, no.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.745
You don't want this slut.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.392
There's a much bigger slut in there,

32:42.460 --> 32:46.396
and I want her skirt,
could you just go get it for me?

32:51.336 --> 32:53.804
[Breathing heavily]

32:55.073 --> 32:56.938
The horror...

32:58.443 --> 32:59.967
All right...

33:03.348 --> 33:06.249
- Thank you so much.
- Have a good show.

33:07.585 --> 33:09.485
Thank you.

33:10.588 --> 33:12.613
- Oh! I'm sorry!
- Excuse me.

33:12.690 --> 33:13.952
[Gasping]

33:14.025 --> 33:16.789
Oh, my God! Katharine McPhee!

33:16.861 --> 33:20.456
Hi, I'm Betty Suarez,
Daniel Meade's assistant.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.125
<i>A huge Idol fan, by the way, huge.</i>

33:23.201 --> 33:25.726
Totally had the McFever!

33:25.803 --> 33:27.532
Have you seen Daniel, by the way?

33:27.605 --> 33:31.268
No, I haven't, but, I'm sorry,
did you say "Suarez"?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.572
Are you Hilda's sister?

33:33.644 --> 33:36.841
She's awesome, you know,
actually, I signed a CD for her.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.848
Can you give that to her? Thanks.

33:41.919 --> 33:43.978
Here. Get McFever.

33:45.757 --> 33:48.123
- [Door closing]
- [Footsteps approaching]

33:48.192 --> 33:52.390
Well, enjoy the show. Some of us are
watching from the unemployment line.

33:52.463 --> 33:55.626
- What?
- My freakin' sister just fired me!

33:55.700 --> 33:59.067
Mine just came back from the dead.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.002
And he's hot.

34:01.072 --> 34:05.532
- What are you talking about?
- Just... I'm having a bad day.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.043
Yeah, well, I've had a bad month.

34:08.112 --> 34:09.909
Give me that.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.315
Hey. I've been honking!
You called for a cab?

34:22.393 --> 34:23.951
Actually, I called for you.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.996
- Are you, uh, Toussaint Duvallier?
- Yeah, who are you?

34:27.065 --> 34:29.931
That's not important.
It's about Constance.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.469
Is she here? Do I smell gumbo?

34:32.536 --> 34:36.438
- No! No!
- Hey, relax! She's not here.

34:36.507 --> 34:38.270
I just wanna talk to you.

34:38.342 --> 34:42.301
Look, Toussaint...
you hurt her really bad.

34:42.380 --> 34:45.315
And she's such a special person.

34:45.382 --> 34:47.943
Are you sure you want
to give up that much loving?

34:48.018 --> 34:51.216
- What is it to you?
- Well, I...

34:53.791 --> 34:55.918
Oh!

34:56.860 --> 34:59.352
- She's your case worker.
- How'd you know?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.364
How do you think
me and her hooked up?

35:01.432 --> 35:05.630
This is how she operates. First she
starts showing up three times a day.

35:05.703 --> 35:08.365
- Yeah!
- Then she starts moving her chair

35:08.439 --> 35:10.066
closer and closer.

35:10.141 --> 35:13.304
Before you know it, crying about
the last guy who dumped her.

35:13.377 --> 35:16.710
Exactly. How does she
get away with this?

35:16.781 --> 35:19.807
She is the one stamping
"denied" or "approved."

35:19.884 --> 35:22.717
- I can't play this game.
- You want your green card?

35:22.787 --> 35:24.311
You don't have a choice, man.

35:24.388 --> 35:28.415
Ride that squishy train
until you reach your destination.

35:31.395 --> 35:33.363
No, don't just lick it, eat it!

35:33.431 --> 35:36.127
That's it, it's just chewing,
and then a swallow.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.227
- Here we go, have another one.
- Christina, I need to speak with you.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.671
Oh, thank you, Jason.
Now go play with the belts.

35:43.741 --> 35:45.572
- OK!
- I can't do this.

35:45.643 --> 35:49.135
I should just go back to Scotland
and knit tea cozies.

35:49.213 --> 35:52.842
Oh, cool it, Bagpipes. I chose you
because of your fresh new talent.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.351
You picked me because
I did you a shady favor.

35:55.419 --> 35:58.650
That doesn't mean you haven't
worked hard or paid your dues.

35:58.723 --> 36:01.749
I have one little change in the line-up.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.919
I'm replacing your final model.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.487
- You can't just spring this on me now!
- I just did.

36:09.066 --> 36:11.261
<i>- OK, terrific...
- Models on in five.</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:15.597
Have you seen Daniel?

36:15.673 --> 36:17.504
Where is he?

36:19.076 --> 36:21.442
Daniel! Hilda!

36:32.924 --> 36:34.858
Hilda, what the hell are you doing?

36:35.593 --> 36:38.061
- Betty...
- Your father's looking for you.

36:38.129 --> 36:41.690
- The show's starting.
- Look, I know this seems...

36:41.766 --> 36:43.859
I didn't mean to...

36:46.103 --> 36:48.196
I'm gonna go inside.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.970
I thought I told you to go home.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.981
Hey, I don't take orders from you
anymore. I was fired, remember?

36:58.049 --> 37:00.677
Like you ever listen
to my orders to begin with!

37:00.751 --> 37:02.719
Is this your way of getting back at me?

37:02.787 --> 37:05.551
<i>- Hurts, huh?
- Hilda, Mode is mine.</i>

37:05.623 --> 37:08.057
- You can't have this, too.
- What?

37:08.125 --> 37:10.593
Do you have any idea
how hard it has been for me

37:10.661 --> 37:12.959
to get these people
to remember my name?

37:13.030 --> 37:16.329
You walk in and in two minutes,
you're everybody's best friend!

37:16.400 --> 37:18.925
My entire life,
no one has paid attention to me

37:19.003 --> 37:20.937
- when you're in the room.
- Please.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.939
You want to know the truth?

37:23.007 --> 37:25.999
I loved watching you sit on a couch,
eating cookie dough.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.046
Because for the first time,
I was the center of attention!

37:29.113 --> 37:31.013
By the way, that was my cookie dough!

37:31.082 --> 37:33.949
Well, I am glad to see
you're in my corner.

37:34.018 --> 37:36.782
Hilda, don't turn this around
and make it about you!

37:36.854 --> 37:39.846
Do you know how hard it is
for me, Betty?

37:39.924 --> 37:42.154
First impressions, that's all I got.

37:42.226 --> 37:46.094
So if I don't flirt with the boys
and joke with the girls,

37:46.163 --> 37:50.259
they'll realize there's not much behind
the tight jeans and the low-cut top.

37:51.969 --> 37:54.301
[Sputtering]
That is such crap!

37:55.006 --> 37:58.100
Well, it was worth a shot.
You had some good stuff.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.200
And look, Betty, give me a break.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.803
Today a few models laughed at my jokes.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.644
You're the one with
the great job, the great boss,

38:05.716 --> 38:08.947
some cute guy who is
totally into you, by the way.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.179
In the big race, you're way ahead.

38:17.728 --> 38:20.891
Well, there's plenty of things
that you're good at, too.

38:22.500 --> 38:26.027
Before we set that girl's hair on fire,
it was looking pretty good.

38:26.637 --> 38:29.299
- You think?
- Well, maybe you could...

38:30.007 --> 38:33.101
...get a real job
doing hair or something.

38:33.644 --> 38:36.807
Well, I do work this every morning.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.311
So...

38:40.851 --> 38:42.512
Hilda...

38:42.953 --> 38:46.912
- Why didn't you tell me Henry called?
- I was trying to protect you.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.085
I thought he was some
big city guy who might hurt you.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.790
I'm sorry. I should've known you...

38:53.864 --> 38:56.731
...can take care of yourself.

39:00.705 --> 39:03.697
<i>[Mainline: Shake]</i>

39:18.289 --> 39:21.258
This is amazing.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.664
[Loud applause]

40:19.850 --> 40:24.082
And that was our final designer,
Christina McKinney.

40:24.355 --> 40:27.586
[Applause]

40:31.028 --> 40:34.464
And now, for the man
who's responsible for all of this,

40:34.532 --> 40:36.796
Mr. Bradford Meade.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.135
Thank you.

40:41.205 --> 40:45.733
Thank you. First I'd like to talk
about the future of Meade Publications.

40:45.810 --> 40:48.677
- There have been...
- May I?

40:49.814 --> 40:52.009
I know this is Mr. Meade's time,

40:52.082 --> 40:56.280
but I have an announcement to make about
the future of this company as well.

40:57.788 --> 41:02.122
Two years ago, the Meade family
lost their eldest son, Alex.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.060
- What are you doing?
- What Mr. Meade doesn't know

41:05.129 --> 41:09.566
is that while he may have lost a son,
he gained a daughter.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.601
[Audience gasping]

41:11.669 --> 41:14.866
- [Excited chattering]
- [Woman] This is scandalous!

41:16.674 --> 41:18.801
Hi, Daddy. I'm back.

41:19.743 --> 41:22.439
- Alex?
- You can call me "Alexis."

41:25.883 --> 41:29.080
Mr. Meade? You're under arrest
for the murder of Fey Sommers.

41:29.153 --> 41:30.814
Put your hands behind your back.

41:30.888 --> 41:33.948
Hands behind your back.
You have the right to remain silent.

41:34.024 --> 41:37.016
Anything you say can be
used against you in a court of law.

41:37.094 --> 41:39.028
You have the right to an attorney.

41:41.398 --> 41:44.299
That envelope you had me
take to the police station...

41:47.471 --> 41:49.371
You used me!

41:50.808 --> 41:54.437
Used you? I made you a star!

41:54.512 --> 41:56.605
[Man] This way, Alexis!

42:03.988 --> 42:06.286
That's Alex?

42:07.424 --> 42:09.449
Yeah.

42:10.928 --> 42:13.658
Is it fun having a sister?

42:14.305 --> 42:20.383
