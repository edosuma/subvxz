>> I WALKED INTO THIS HOUSE, AND
EVERY SINGLE PERSON KNEW THAT I

WAS ONE VOTE SHY OF WINNING THE
GAME LAST YEAR, AND THE FACT

03:21.402 --> 03:24.204
THAT I GOT TO THIS POINT AGAIN,
THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.640
>> HE'S GOING TO BREAK MY OTHER
FOOT.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.778
>> EVERY WEEK I PUT FORTH A
PLAY, AND I SAW IT UNFOLD IN

03:30.811 --> 03:31.945
FRONT OF MY EYES.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.882
I DID NOT PUT IN ALL THIS HARD
WORK TO COME IN SECOND PLACE

03:34.915 --> 03:40.120
AGAIN, AND IF YOU THINK I'M
STOPPING NOW, YOU'RE WRONG,

03:40.153 --> 03:41.855

THERE'S NO EASY WAY TO DECIDE

04:00.107 --> 04:04.545
AND I'M NOT READY TO HAVE THAT
DECISION UNTIL I'M FORCED TO

04:04.578 --> 04:08.215
HAVE THAT DECISION.

04:08.248 --> 04:12.386
>> JOSH, CHRISTMAS, AND I HAVE
WORKED REALLY HARD AS TEAM

04:12.420 --> 04:15.222
TOGETHER, BUT RIGHT NOW AT THIS
POINT IT'S EVERY MAN AND WOMAN

04:15.255 --> 04:16.290
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

04:16.324 --> 04:17.558
>> I GOT EXCITED.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.895
>> I KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO PULL
MY WHOLE GAME FULL CIRCLE I HAVE

04:23.063 --> 04:25.999
I HAVE TO TAKE A SHOT AT PAUL.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.136

MIGHT JUST HAVE TO TAKE IT.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.506
>> CHEERS.

04:32.540 --> 04:42.583
>> OH, NO WAY.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.194
>> NO WAY.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.196
WE GOT LOBSTER.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.097
OH, MY GOD.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.131
OH, MY GOD.

04:58.165 --> 05:06.940
WE GOT CALAMARI.

05:06.974 --> 05:10.210
GUYS, HONESTLY, WE MADE IT TO
FINAL THREE.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.311
FINAL THREE.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.181
>> I WOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE
UNLESS SOMEBODY PUSHED THAT

05:14.214 --> 05:19.119
BUTTON TO WIN THAT $25,000, SO
SHOUT OUT TO THEM.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.822
>> I WISH I WOULD HAVE WON, BUT
IT WAS KEVIN.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.290
>> HE DIDN'T ADMIT TO IT.

05:23.323 --> 05:29.397
>> BUT HE KIND OF DID.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.199
>> LOOKS LIKE I'M SENDING YOU TO
THE JURY THURSDAY NIGHT.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.235
I WANTED TO LET MATT KNOW THE
TRUTH, BECAUSE I WENT OVER TO

05:35.268 --> 05:39.907
TELL HIM, LISTEN, PAL, LET ME
TELL YOU A SECRET, MAN, I WON

05:39.940 --> 05:41.809
THE MONEY AT THE BEGINNING.

05:41.842 --> 05:42.576
HE'S GOING HOME.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.244
WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER SEE HIM
AGAIN.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.579
BOOM, WHY NOT JUST DO IT.

05:45.613 --> 05:48.716
SO MATT, THAT FIRST NIGHT WHEN
WE CAME, IN I TOOK THAT

05:48.749 --> 05:53.621
TEMPTATION.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.389
>> Julie: AND THE TEMPTATION

05:55.423 --> 05:58.892
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED.

05:58.926 --> 06:02.463
>> WHAT, ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO
TELL EVERYBODY AFTER?

06:02.496 --> 06:03.731
YOU'D BE A TARGET.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.299
THE ONLY THING I DIDN'T TELL ON
THIS SHOW, AND YOU'LL SEE THAT,

06:06.333 --> 06:09.269
AND THAT WAS A GOOD MOVE I
THOUGHT.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.704
I AIN'T TELLING NOBODY ELSE.

06:10.738 --> 06:14.675
I'M TELLING YOU ONLY FOR YOU TO
KNOW THEY E-MAIL NOT AS DUMB AS

06:14.708 --> 06:15.709
THEY THINK.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.411
>> I DON'T THINK YOU'RE DUMB FOR
ONE SECOND, BUDDY.

06:17.445 --> 06:21.114
>> WELL JUST KEEP IT BETWEEN US,
WILL YOU DO ME THAT FAVOR?

06:21.148 --> 06:22.282
>> ABSOLUTELY.

06:22.315 --> 06:27.888
>> SO KEVIN TELLS ME THAT HE WON
THE 25K, AND I'M STILL IN

06:27.921 --> 06:30.057
COMPLETE SHOCK.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.660
YOU HAVEN'T TALKED TO ME IN 70
DAYS.

06:32.693 --> 06:45.573
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

07:04.925 --> 07:05.826
>> HE'S GOING HOME.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.495
>> THANKS, DUDE, I APPRECIATE
IT.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.662
>> THANKS, BUDDY.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.699
>> HEY, MATT, YOU WOULDN'T BE
TALKING ABOUT ME, WOULD YOU,

07:11.732 --> 07:11.999
MAN?

07:12.032 --> 07:12.866
>> WHAT?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.602
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT
ME?

07:14.635 --> 07:15.736
>> NO.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.471
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE TELLING
ANYONE ANYTHING I HAD SAID TO

07:17.505 --> 07:18.171
YOU?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.039
>> IF I DID, THAT'S MY BUSINESS.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.274
>> YOU TOLD ME IT WAS BETWEEN ME
AND YOU.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.045
>> KEVIN, IN THIS GAME I CAN
TELL ANYBODY ANYTHING I WANT.

07:25.078 --> 07:28.115
>> YOU COULD MAKE IT UP, TOO.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.917
>> WHY WOULD I MAKE STUFF UP.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.485
>> WHY WOULD YOU MAKE STUFF UP.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.120
>> DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
ME?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.122
>> ARE YOU THREATENING PEOPLE
AGAIN, DUDE?

07:35.155 --> 07:36.890
>> I DIDN'T THREATEN YOU.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.058
I NEVER SAID NOTHING TO YOU.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.127
>> WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.663
>> LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S TELLING YOU.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.099
I NEVER SAID NOTHING TO HIM.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.200
MATT TOLD EVERYBODY.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.302
IT'S MY OWN FAULT FOR TRUFORTING
HIM.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.304
I KNEW HE WASN'T TRUSTWORTHY.

07:51.338 --> 07:53.541
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

07:53.574 --> 07:56.143
>> I ASKED HIM IF HE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT ME.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.310
HE SAID.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.146
NO I SAID, DON'T SAY THINGS
ABOUT ME THAT I NEVER SAID TO

07:59.179 --> 07:59.813
YOU.

07:59.847 --> 08:00.681
>> I DIDN'T TELL THEM NOTHING.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.349
>> WHAT IS IT THAT HE SAID?

08:02.382 --> 08:05.485
>> I HAVE NO IDEA, PAUL.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.387
I HAVE NO IDEA.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.456
ANYONE CAN MAKE ANYTHING THEY
WANT UP.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.724
WHAT CAN YOU SAY?

08:10.758 --> 08:11.892
THERE WAS NOBODY THERE.

08:11.925 --> 08:16.196
>> DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT TELL
MATTHEW YOU WON THE $25,000?

08:16.229 --> 08:17.297
>> NO, I DID NOT.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.331
>> OH, OKAY.

08:18.365 --> 08:19.366
>> WERE YOU THERE?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.135
>> DON'T GET CLOSE TO ME.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.303
DO NOT GET CLOSE TO ME.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.538
>> WERE YOU THERE?

08:24.572 --> 08:28.776
>> I WAS NOT THERE, BUT MATTHEW
TOLD ME, AND I TRUST MATTHEW.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.911
>> AND I'M TELLING YOU I DIDN'T
TELL HIM THAT.

08:30.944 --> 08:31.779
>> YES, YOU DID.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.080
>> WELL, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.414
>> HE CAN SAY WHAT HE WANTS.

08:34.447 --> 08:35.583
>> WHAT DID YOU TELL ME.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.052
>> I TOLD YOU I WON $25,000,
HUH?

08:39.086 --> 08:39.452
>> YEAH.

08:39.486 --> 08:40.688
>> I DID NOT.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.722
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.057
YOU'RE MAKING IT UP TO SAVE HER
FOR NEXT WEEK.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.058
>> LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

08:45.092 --> 08:47.227
>> I'LL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.029
NEVER TOLD YOU NOTHING, NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.031
>> WOW.

08:51.064 --> 08:51.832
WOW.

08:51.865 --> 08:52.633
YO YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.334
>> EVERYONE'S SOMETHING ELSE BUT
YOU.

08:54.367 --> 08:58.772
>> I LOVE THAT YOU'RE SHOWING
YOUR TRUE COLORS, KEVY.

08:58.806 --> 09:02.342
>> I'M NOT EVEN TALKING TO YOU.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.577
>> I TRUST MATTHEW.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.245
I HAVE NO REASON TO TRUST YOU.

09:05.278 --> 09:10.651
>> YOU HAVE NO REASON TO BE
INVOLVED.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.451
I HAVEN'T LIED.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.286
I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL PLAYER ALL
YEAR.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.089
YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK RIDICULOUS.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.925
YOU DON'T SAY NOTHING ALL
SUMMER.

09:17.958 --> 09:19.092
GO BACK IN THE ROOM AND CUDDLE.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.195
>> KEVIN, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
THIS SUMMER?

09:22.229 --> 09:23.631
>> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

09:23.664 --> 09:25.999

09:33.106 --> 09:34.541
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT ALREADY.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.343
>> DON'T YELL AT ME, KEVIN.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.446
YOU THINK I'M A LITTLE GIRL, BE
QUIET, GO AWAY.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.981
YOU THINK YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS
GAME.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.449

09:42.482 --> 09:44.852
YOU THINK YOU KNOW HOW TO PLAY
THIS GAME?

09:44.885 --> 09:47.354
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO COME IN
SECOND PLACE, ALEX, BECAUSE YOU

09:58.165 --> 09:59.499
BETTER THAN YOU, AM I RIGHT?

09:59.532 --> 10:01.702
>> DON'T NOT GET IN HER FACE.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.536
>> A SHOE WOULD BE ABLE TO BEAT
YOU.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.806
>> COME ON, KEVIN.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.841
BYE.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.255
>> WHAT'S WITH THE ABSURD AMOUNT
OF SHOWMANCES THIS SEASON.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.423
>> JODY.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.160
THEY LOOKED LIKE ROMEO AND
JULIETTE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT

10:27.194 --> 10:29.062
WAS REAL.

10:29.096 --> 10:32.900
>> MY MOM COULD BE WATCHING ME
RIGHT NOW, AND MY MOM KNOWS MORE

10:32.933 --> 10:34.001
ABOUT YOU THAN I DO.

10:34.034 --> 10:39.506
>> I PROMISE YOU THAT NOTHING
ABOUT ME ADDITIONALLY IS

10:39.539 --> 10:40.507
NEGATIVE.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.543
THERE'S JUST A FEW THINGS IN MY
PERSONNEL LIFE.

10:43.576 --> 10:48.215
>> DO YOU HAVE A WHILE?

10:48.248 --> 10:58.625
>> YES.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.493
>> YOU HAVE A KID?

11:00.527 --> 11:01.729
>> JESS, STOP.

11:01.762 --> 11:06.466
I HAD TO GO BASICALLY MY SUMMER
THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD WITH MY

11:06.499 --> 11:07.367
FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER PAISLEY.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.502
THE TOUGHEST PART OF BEING IN
THIS HOUSE.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.104
SHE'S EXTREMELY SMART, EXTHEMLY
BEAUTIFUL.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.306
I PROBABLY WON'T TALK ABOUT HER
MUCH ON THE SHOW.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.642
I DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER TO BE
USED AS AMMUNITION AGAINST ME.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.877
>> ARE YOU MARRIED?

11:16.910 --> 11:23.717
>> NEW NO, I'M NOT.

11:23.751 --> 11:27.687
>> HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE AT
HOME ARE LIKE THINKING ABOUT

11:27.721 --> 11:29.990
YOU?

11:30.023 --> 11:33.426
LIKE GAME PLAY?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.163
BECAUSE YOU'VE SHOCKED THE HELL
OUT OF ME.

11:36.196 --> 11:36.730
>> WHY?

11:36.764 --> 11:37.965
>> I DON'T KNOW.

11:37.998 --> 11:43.070
I JUST LIKE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO
BE SO GOOD AT IT.

11:43.103 --> 11:47.674
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.542
>> I'LL TAKE THIS AS A
COMPLIMENT.

11:49.576 --> 11:54.681
>> NO, IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.549
HER NAME IS PAISLEY AND SHE'S
FIVE YEARS OLD.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.086
>> STOP.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.053
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER?

12:00.087 --> 12:02.055
>> UH-HUH.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.656
A LITTLE GIRL NAMED PAISLEY.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.926
>> THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

12:05.959 --> 12:10.898
>> SMART AS HELL, LIKE ONE OF
THE SMARTEST KIDS YOU'LL EVER

12:10.931 --> 12:14.167
MEET, NOT SOME BOOGER EATER.

12:14.201 --> 12:16.303
YOU SHOULD SEE HOW PRETTY SHE
IS, TOO.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.604
>> OH, MY GOD.

12:17.637 --> 12:21.541
I HAVE TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.145
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD ME.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.780
I'M FLATTERED.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.048
>> YEAH.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.584
>> I HAVE NEVER DATED A GAY WHO
HAS A DAUGHTER BEFORE, SO I

12:31.618 --> 12:34.621
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL RIGHT
OFF THE BAT, BUT SEEING HIS FACE

12:34.654 --> 12:38.158
LIGHT UP TALK ABOUT HER, I THINK
IT'S SO ENDEARING, AND I'M

12:38.191 --> 12:44.898
REALLY HAPPY THAT HE DECIDED TO
SHARE THAT WITH ME.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.168
>> THANK YOU FOR TELLING ME.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.737
>> MY PLEASURE.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.975
>> THERE WERE A LOT OF
SHOWMANCES, THERE WERE POWER

12:55.008 --> 12:58.345
DUO, BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE
GROUP THAT WAS TRUE FRIENDSHIP,

12:58.378 --> 13:02.682
HUH, HUH?

13:02.715 --> 13:04.684
I MEAN, WE PREVAILED.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.187
>> YOU'RE MY MEATBALL, JOSH.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.023
AND PAUL, YOU'RE MY FRIENDSHIP
PAUL.

13:10.057 --> 13:10.991
SO I DON'T KNOW.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.459
I GET TO BE YOUR CHRISTMAS JOY.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.595
>> CHRISTMAS, YOU'RE THE COOLEST
GIRL EVER.

13:15.628 --> 13:22.502
YOU HAVE ABOUT AS MANY TATTOOS
AS I HAVE AND EQUALLY AS CRAZY.

13:22.535 --> 13:26.606
>> YOU GUYS SLEEP TOGETHER LIKE
MARRIED COUPLE?

13:26.639 --> 13:30.043
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, AND YOU
GUYS ARE SNUGGLED UP LIKE

13:30.077 --> 13:30.677
BABIES.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.212
>> I LIKE TO SNUGGLE.

13:32.245 --> 13:37.117
>> CHRISTMAS AND PAUL?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.286
THEY DID TANDEM SKYDIVING.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.288
THESE TWO HAVE BEEN INSEPARABLE.

13:41.321 --> 13:45.158
YOU DO REALIZE YOU TOOK OFF THE
SKYDIVING SUITS A LONG TIME AGO,

13:45.192 --> 13:46.159
RIGHT?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.394
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ATTACHED
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

13:47.427 --> 13:52.332
>> HE SAID, OUCH, I TOUCHED YOU.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.800
I DIDN'T EVEN PINCH YOU.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.104
>> STOP IT, CHRISTMAS JOY, I
HAVE LIQUIDS IN MY HAND.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.538
>> OUCH, OUCH.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.306
IT'S REALLY PRETTY.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.008
>> YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY,
CHRISTMAS.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.875
>> THANK YOU, PAUL.

14:01.909 --> 14:08.048
>> WHAT IS THAT?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.616
>> CUT IT OUT.

14:09.649 --> 14:10.650
STOP THE CUDDLES.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.485
STOP THE EATING TOGETHER.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.420
>> OH, MY GOD.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.255
>> IT'S DRIVING ME NUTS.

14:15.288 --> 14:19.459
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M JEALOUS OR I
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I'M

14:19.492 --> 14:21.328
THE THIRD WHEEL.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.530
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT I
WANT IT TO END.

14:23.563 --> 14:27.400
>> SOMEBODY SAID THEY LIKE MY
FRECKLES.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.468
>> I LIKE FRECKLES.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.738
I THINK FRECKLES MAKE A GIRL
REALLY CUTE.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.507
>> CAN YOU PLAY WITH THE BACK OF
MY HAIR?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.377
>> I THINK PAUL IS ONE OF THE
MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE THAT

14:37.410 --> 14:38.145
I'VE EVER MET.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.747
HE'S BRILLIANT, FUNNY, VERY
WEIRD.

14:40.780 --> 14:47.487
HE GIVES ME SMILES, AND HE MAKES
ME GIGGLE.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.256
I LIKE HANGING OUT WITH PAUL A
LOT.

14:49.289 --> 14:53.226
I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE BEING IN
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE THIS

14:53.260 --> 14:58.999
SUMMER WITHOUT PAUL.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.968
>> HE'S A FUNNY GUY.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.118
>> THIS GAME IS REALLY HARD.

15:18.151 --> 15:30.163
IT'S CRAZY HOW YOUR FEELINGS
START TO GO WILD IN HERE.

15:30.197 --> 15:36.036
MY HEART, MY MIND, I'M IN THIS
PURGATORY OF EMOTION, AND

15:36.069 --> 15:38.972
SOMETIMES MY HEART STOPS.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.974
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:41.008 --> 15:46.046
WHAT -- PAUL MAKES ME SMILE.

15:46.079 --> 15:49.316
THERE'S A LITTLE NUGGET OF
INFORMATION.

15:49.349 --> 15:52.685
I'M JUST NOT NORMALLY IN A
POSITION WHERE MY HEART GETS

15:52.719 --> 16:01.428
AWAY FROM ME, AND I FEEL LIKE
IT'S GETTING AWAY FROM ME.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.931
PAUL, I'M GOING TO COME OUT OF
HERE AND DISCOVER WHETHER OR NOT

16:04.964 --> 16:13.473
MY HEART IS BROKEN OR HEALED.

16:13.506 --> 16:19.046
I FEEL SO UPSIDE DOWN RIGHT NOW.

16:19.079 --> 16:25.118
>> SO GUYS, THE LONGEST-RUNNING
SHOWMANCE THIS SEASON WAS MAVEN.

16:25.152 --> 16:29.922
MATT WAS COOL, BUT IF IT WASN'T
FOR RAVEN, I WOULDN'T SEE MUCH

16:29.956 --> 16:30.523
OF MATT.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.292
>> RAGING RAVEN.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.593
>> YEAH.

16:33.626 --> 16:34.727
RAGING RAVEN.

16:34.761 --> 16:38.631
>> THEY REALLY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING OTHER THAN THROW CEREAL

16:38.665 --> 16:40.167
AND MILK ON EACH OTHER.

16:40.200 --> 16:40.867
>> YEAH.

16:40.900 --> 16:45.738
>> YEAH.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.174
>> MATT.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.676
MATT.

16:49.709 --> 16:50.777
>> IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING.

16:50.810 --> 16:55.982
>> HOW FUNNY IS IT?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.417
>> OUCH.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.018
>> DON'T.

16:59.052 --> 17:02.922
WHEN YOU'RE LIVING WITH SOMEONE
YOU LIKE IN THE "BIG BROTHER"

17:02.955 --> 17:07.827
HOUSE, YOU'RE BOUND TO GET ON
EACH OTHER'S NERVES.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.865
>> YEAH, THAT WAS SPEEDY.

17:12.899 --> 17:13.833
THE.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.035
>> EMOTIONS RUN HIGH, SO YOU
MIGHT BUTT HEADS.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.238
>> GOD, YOU ARE SO SIMPLE.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.739
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

17:19.772 --> 17:20.607
>> GET HIM.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.511
>> PAUL, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU,
GUY?

17:24.544 --> 17:29.449
>> OH, MAN, RIGHT IN IT.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.318
>> GO AHEAD.

17:31.351 --> 17:32.652
>> HAVE IT.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.254
I ALREADY HAVE IT ALL OVER ME.

17:34.287 --> 17:34.821
I DON'T CARE.

17:34.854 --> 17:41.528
>> IT'S NOT WET.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.030
>> WATCH IT.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.800
>> AND SAY TAN COMES OUT.

17:47.834 --> 17:51.138
I'M SCARED.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.606
>> I SWEAR TO GOD.

17:53.640 --> 17:57.677
>> NORMALLY MATT AND RAVEN JUST
SIT IN THE CORNER AND EAT CEREAL

17:57.710 --> 17:58.878
ALL DAY AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

17:58.911 --> 18:03.049
BUT HERE THEY ARE THROWING
CEREAL AT EACH OTHER, AND I'M

18:03.082 --> 18:03.883
LOVING IT.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.552
>> DID YOU GET IT IN YOUR WIG.

18:05.585 --> 18:09.822
>> DID YOU SAY "WIG"?

18:09.856 --> 18:12.525
>> I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.395
>> OVERREACTING?

18:15.428 --> 18:19.266
OH, MY GOD.

18:19.299 --> 18:22.569
OH, MY GOD.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.504
>> IT'S LIKE MAGIC SHOW.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.340
RAVEN AND MATT ARE SUCH A
BIZARRE COUPLE THAT I IMAGINE IF

18:27.374 --> 18:30.243
THEY KEEP DATING OUTSIDE OF THIS
HOUSE, THEIR GROCERY BILL IS

18:30.277 --> 18:33.513
GOING TO BE SUPER EXPENSIVE, AND
WHATEVER GROCERY STORE IS MOST

18:33.546 --> 18:35.982
CONVENIENT TO THEM IS GOING TO
BE STOKED, BECAUSE BUSINESS WILL

18:36.015 --> 18:41.087
BE BOOMING.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.391
>> CINNAMON CHALLENGE FAIL.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.426
>> OH, MY GOD.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.104
AMERICA'S VOTE.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.339
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSEGUESTS
HAVE FOUGHT HARD.

18:59.372 --> 19:03.543

WE GOT THE PAY OUR RESPECTS TO
KEVY, THE LAST 56-YEAR-OLD

19:39.045 --> 19:39.779
STANDING.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.982
>> THE ONLY 56-YEAR-OLD
STANDING.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.218
I DON'T KNOW IF KEVIN WAS REALLY
GANGSTER.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.953
HE HAD A LOT OF STORIES.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.221
HE WORE THE SUITS.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.722
THE GUY ALWAYS LOOKED PRETTY
SHARP.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.257
>> YES.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.624
>> HE DID, HE DID.

19:51.658 --> 19:55.528
>> SMOOTH KEVIN.

19:55.562 --> 20:01.434
>> LIKE IN THE MAFIA WHEN YOU'RE
GOING TO GET KILLED, AT THE BAR

20:01.468 --> 20:04.271
THAT NIGHT, EVERYONE IS HUGGING
AND KISSING YOU.

20:04.304 --> 20:08.441
THEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DOOR
LIKE, OH, NO, WHAT ARE THEY

20:08.475 --> 20:09.509
STANDING OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.011
>> KEVIN COULD BE A LITTLE VAGUE
ABOUT HIS PAST, HIS

20:12.044 --> 20:13.446
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE HE COMES
FROM, WHAT HE DOES.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.883
>> AND THEN THE OTHER DOOR, OH,
NO, AND YOU AIN'T GOT YOUR GUN

20:16.916 --> 20:17.850
WITH YOU.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.018
YOU'RE LIKE...

20:19.051 --> 20:25.258
>> SOMETIMES LIVING WITH KEVIN
IS LIKE LIVING WITH A MONK.

20:25.292 --> 20:26.459
>> WOW.

20:26.493 --> 20:26.993
WOW.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.361
LOOK AT YOU GO, BUDDY.

20:28.395 --> 20:31.564
YOU LOOK LIKE $100.

20:31.598 --> 20:35.735
>> ALL THIS GUY PACKED WAS SUITS
WHOM WEARS SUITS FOR THE SUMMER.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.004
AM I ABOUT TO GET WHACKED?

20:38.037 --> 20:40.106
>> SO NO ONE HAS BROUGHT ME UP
AT ALL?

20:40.139 --> 20:41.708
>> I HAVEN'T TOLL ANYONE ABOUT
YOU.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.710
>> GOOD.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.345
>> LOOK, PAYING PEOPLE OFF.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.781
>> THAT'S HOW YOU YELL AT
SOMEONE.

20:48.815 --> 20:49.649
>> LIKE THAT?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.984
>> NO, THAT'S ROCK 'N' ROLL,
MAN.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.420
>> IT IS?

20:53.453 --> 20:54.053
NO.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.955
>> HE GIVES PEOPLE ALIASES.

20:55.988 --> 20:58.958
>> MATT IS THE PROFESSOR.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.927
ALEX, TERMINATOR X.

21:00.960 --> 21:05.097
>> HANGING OUT IN BARS.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.700
>> I'M LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.902
THEN HE STARTED CHASING ME
AROUND THE POOL TABLE.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.573
I REMEMBER WE WERE PLAYING CARDS
IN THE CELLAR OF THE KNIGHTS OF

21:13.606 --> 21:14.774
COLUMBUS.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.343
THERE WAS A GUNFIGHT IN THE
CELLAR, SO THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR

21:16.376 --> 21:18.277
THE BULLETS TO GO.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.413
THEY WERE RICOCHETING
EVERYWHERE.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.450
>> THEY WERE HAVING A GUNFIGHT
IN THE KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS.

21:23.483 --> 21:27.954
>> LOOK I DON'T WANT TO SWIM
WITH THE FISHES.

21:27.987 --> 21:31.858
I THINK WE GOT THE GET RID OF
KEVIN BEFORE HE GETS RID OF ME.

21:31.891 --> 21:35.294
LOOK, KEVIN TOLD SOME STORIES
AND MAYBE HE TALKED TOO MUCH,

21:35.328 --> 21:38.465
WHICH MIGHT MAKE ME BELIEVE HE
WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A RAT, BUT I

21:38.498 --> 21:40.199
DON'T THINK HE WAS THE ONLY RAT
IN HERE.

21:40.232 --> 21:44.437
>> GUY, NO, THERE WAS A REAL RAT
IN THE HOUSE.

21:44.471 --> 21:47.039
>> YEAH, AND YOU WERE TERRIFIED
OF IT.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.976
>> IS SOMEONE IN THE DINING
ROOM?

21:50.009 --> 21:52.645
>> THERE'S A RAT.

21:52.679 --> 21:53.680
LOOK IN THE CABINET.

21:53.713 --> 21:54.414
IT'S MOVING.

21:54.447 --> 21:54.814
OH, MY GOD.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.048
>> WHERE?

21:56.082 --> 21:57.584
>> YOU SEE IT?

21:57.617 --> 21:59.886
IN THE CABINET.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.087
>> OH.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.090
WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH THE
DINING ROOM CAMERA AND INSTEAD

22:04.123 --> 22:09.362
OF SEEING SOMEBODY BEING FISHY
AND SNEAKY, WE SEE A GIANT RAT,

22:09.396 --> 22:12.198
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
SOMEBODY BEING A RAT AND RATTING

22:12.231 --> 22:16.403
SOMEBODY ELSE OUT, I AM TALKING
ABOUT A RODENT, A RAT WITH A

22:16.436 --> 22:20.740
TAIL THE SIZE OF MY DAMN LEG.

22:20.773 --> 22:25.244
>> IT JUST RAN, IT JUST RAN.

22:25.277 --> 22:33.753
>> LISTEN, I'M A BIG GUY AND I
GOT BIG CAJONES, BUT I AM NOT

22:33.786 --> 22:34.854
HUNTING DOWN THIS RAT.

22:34.887 --> 22:40.460
YOU GO, I'M NOT GOING DOWN.

22:40.493 --> 22:49.969
HE'S BEHIND THE OVEN.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.075
>> HOW ABOUT WE STAY QUIET AND

23:06.218 --> 23:07.086
HE'LL COME OUT.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.522
WE'LL RAY OUT CHEESE.

23:09.556 --> 23:16.663
RATS GIVE ME THE HEEBIE HEEBIE-J
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO BED

23:16.696 --> 23:18.665
AND CLOSING MY EYES IF THIS RAT
ISN'T CAUGHT.

23:18.698 --> 23:20.600
>> GO GET CHEDDAR CHEESE.

23:20.633 --> 23:24.236
>> NO, DON'T USE THE PEPPER
JACK.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.706
DON'T PUT... NO.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.442
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LEAD
HIM TO, THE TRAP?

23:29.476 --> 23:34.514
>> YEAH, THE TRAP.

23:34.547 --> 23:35.748
>> HOLD ON.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.083
SO IF HE COMES...

23:37.116 --> 23:38.918
>> PAUL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:38.951 --> 23:40.587
>> I'M MAKING A MOUSETRAP.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.089
>> YOU TWO ARE FOOLS.

23:43.122 --> 23:47.326
>> IF WE CATCH HIM WITH THIS,
WE'VE JUST INVENTED A WHOLE NEW

23:47.359 --> 23:47.727
RAT LIKE THING.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.195
>> A RAT TRAP?

23:49.228 --> 23:50.630
HE'S GOING THE LAUGH AT THIS.

23:50.663 --> 23:57.570
>> NOW THAT THIS RAT TRAP IS SET
UP, I'M NOT SCARED --

23:57.604 --> 24:03.810
>> HE'LL BE CHEWING ON YOUR EAR

24:03.843 --> 24:05.044
WHEN YOU WAKE UP.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.446
WE DIDN'T ONLY HAVE A RAT IN THE
HOUSE, ACCORDING TO DOMINIQUE,

24:07.480 --> 24:17.524
WE ALSO HAD A SNAKE IN THE
HOUSE.

24:17.524 --> 24:29.602
WE ALSO HAD A SNAKE IN THE
HOUSE.

24:29.636 --> 24:38.044
>> I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER THIS,
A SNAKE IN THE HOUSE.

24:38.077 --> 24:43.916
SNAKES WILL DO WHATEVER THEY
HAVE TO DO TO BITE YOU.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.353
I ALWANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE
GAME.

24:47.386 --> 24:52.191
THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE THAT SALT
LAKE CITIERS.

24:52.224 --> 24:55.995
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU TO
MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY TO MENTION

24:56.028 --> 24:57.429
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT WITH
EVERYBODY.

24:57.463 --> 25:00.533
>> YES.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.668
WHO DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

25:01.701 --> 25:02.368
>> EVERYBODY.

25:02.401 --> 25:03.603
>> OKAY.

25:03.636 --> 25:06.238
SHE'S TALKING ABOUT A SNAKE AND
A TEMPTER AND SOMETHING ABOUT

25:06.272 --> 25:06.773
PAUL.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.610
NOW SHE WANTS MEANING.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.912
DOMINIQUE IS REALLY FREAKING ME
OUT.

25:12.945 --> 25:15.447
SO I FOUND OUT WHO THE SNAKE IS.

25:15.481 --> 25:18.751
>> LET'S HEAR IT.

25:18.785 --> 25:23.455
ME?

25:23.489 --> 25:27.159
I WILL WAKE UP THIS ENTIRE HOUSE
RIGHT NOW AND PUT DOMINIQUE IN

25:27.193 --> 25:27.927
THE CENTER AND SAY...

25:27.960 --> 25:29.796
>> SHE WANTS TO DO A FULL
MEETING.

25:29.829 --> 25:30.830
>> OH, MY GOD.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.231
>> IS SHE AWAKE?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.266
>> OH, YEAH.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.668
>> OH, MY GOD.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.169
ARE WE GOING TO DO THIS RIGHT
NOW?

25:37.203 --> 25:39.672
>> I'M DOWN TO GO DO IT RIGHT
NOW.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.007
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

25:41.040 --> 25:51.317
>> THAT'S IS CRAZY.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.156
>> OH, MY GOD.

25:57.189 --> 25:58.224
>> DOMINIQUE.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.325
>> HUH?

25:59.358 --> 26:01.928
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO START
HISSING OR DO YOU WANT ME TO

26:01.961 --> 26:02.428
TALK?

26:02.461 --> 26:03.262
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:03.295 --> 26:04.530
>> WHAT DO I MEAN?

26:04.563 --> 26:09.168
YOU CAN COME UPSTAIRS AND FIND
OUT, BUT UNLESS YOU WANT ME THE

26:09.201 --> 26:12.238
SLIDE OVER THERE AND HISS AT
YOU, WE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.173
>> LET'S DO IT.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.809
>> DOMINIQUE, I'M HONESTLY
SHOCKED THAT YOU'RE TALKING

26:16.843 --> 26:17.944
ABOUT ME.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.747
YOU BETTER HAVE THE RIGHT
AMMUNITION AND BE POINTING THE

26:20.780 --> 26:23.716
RIGHT FINGERS AT ME, BECAUSE IF
NOT I'M GOING TO BITE THOSE

26:23.750 --> 26:24.784
FINGERS OFF.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.386
>> I'M ALL EAR, BUT I DON'T
THINK SNAKES HAVE EARS.

26:27.419 --> 26:28.688
>> THAT'S CUTE.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.923
>> SO YOU THINK I'M THE SNAKE?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.860
>> I THINK YOU HAVE SNAKE
TENDENCIES?

26:33.893 --> 26:35.928
>> I HAVE SNAKE TENDENCIES.

26:35.962 --> 26:38.330
YOU THINK I'M THE ONE PUTTING
THE TARGET ON YOUR BACK?

26:38.364 --> 26:39.498
>> I DON'T KNOW.

26:39.531 --> 26:44.170
>> IS MAYBE DON'T OPEN UP
ASSUMPTIONS WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.106
>> I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.776
DUDE, TO BE HONEST, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME LIKE THAT TO BE COMING

26:49.809 --> 26:50.877
AT ME.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.344
>> DUDE, I WAS POINTED AT.

26:52.378 --> 26:54.914
>> I GET THAT, I DIDN'T POINT AT
YOU.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.583
>> YOU CONSTANTLY DROP
IMPLICATIONS.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.286
OH, BY THE WAY, THERE IS A
SNAKE, SURE THERE IS, BUT YOU

27:00.319 --> 27:02.488
ARE IMPLYING THAT THAT SNAKE IS
ME.

27:02.521 --> 27:06.425
>> THERE IS SOMEBODY THAT I
CONSIDER TO BE A TEMPTER?

27:06.458 --> 27:09.261
WHY, BECAUSE I'M TARGETED FOR
SOMETHING THAT I NEVER DID.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.198
THIS IS WHAT DISLOYALTY LOOKS
LIKE FOR ALL OF YOU SITTING IN

27:12.231 --> 27:12.932
THIS ROOM.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.566
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO
EXPRESS.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.369
AMERICA IS GOING TO SEE THAT I
WAS THE REAL ONE, THAT I AM THE

27:17.403 --> 27:17.937
HONEST ONE.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.138
YOU ALL WILL SEE.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.874
SO PLAY THE GAME HOWEVER YOU
FEEL NECESSARY, AND I'M GOING TO

27:21.908 --> 27:25.812
SAY THIS OPENLY, THEY CAME FOR
ME, AND I GUARANTEE, THEY'RE

27:25.845 --> 27:26.713
COMING FROM YOU.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.114
I PROMISE UNTO GOD.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.782
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, IT'S UP
TO YOU.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.985
>> YOU CAN USE THE BIBLE
WHATEVER YOU'RE LIKE, BUT I'M

27:33.019 --> 27:36.055
PRETTY SURE GOD CANNOT VOUCH FOR
YOU.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.690
>> HE ALMOST YOU'LL SEE.

27:37.724 --> 27:38.357
ISM HE'S NOT HERE.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.591
>> OH, HE'S HERE.

27:39.625 --> 27:41.293
IF I'M HERE, HE'S HERE.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.830
CAN'T YOU ALL SEE WHAT PAUL IS
DOING?

27:43.863 --> 27:47.633
HE'S A VET, SO HE'S USING HIS
EXPERTISE TO MANIPULATE YOU ALL

27:47.666 --> 27:50.469
AND THE MAKE IT SEEM AS IF HE
HAS ALL OF THE ANSWERS.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.041
YOU KNOW WHAT, MY ANSWERS COME
FROM GOD, AND HE'LL NEVER LEAD

27:55.074 --> 27:56.075
ME ASTRAY.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.811
>> YOU'RE GOING HOME THOUGH, I
GUARANTEE YOU THAT.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.646
>> I KNOW I AM AT SOME POINT.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.281
>> EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER.

28:02.314 --> 28:04.650
>> THAT'S SMUG COMING FROM THE
PERSON WHO IS ON THE BLOCK RIGHT

28:04.683 --> 28:06.685
NOW.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.097
>> ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS
ABOUT "BIG BROTHER" IS YOU'RE

28:18.130 --> 28:20.833
STUCK IN A HOUSE FULL OF
STRANGERS, BUT SOME PEOPLE END

28:20.867 --> 28:24.436
UP BECOMING A LITTLE BIT LIKE
FAMILY, LIKE YOU TWO BOZOS FOR

28:24.470 --> 28:24.904
ME.

28:24.937 --> 28:25.738
>> TO FRIENDSHIP.

28:25.772 --> 28:26.272
>> FRIENDSHIP.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.675
>> LA FAMALIA.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.278
>> WE HAVE TO LEAVE ALL OF OUR
FAMILY BEHIND.

28:32.311 --> 28:35.414
>> KEVIN HAD THE LEAVE BEHIND
WHAT, SEVEN KIDS?

28:35.447 --> 28:50.196
>> I THINK WE ALL BECAME HIS
KIDS IN HERE.

28:50.229 --> 28:51.597
>> I GOT A TUB SHOWER.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.399
YOU STAND IN THE TUB AND SHOWER.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.435
>> I GOT A BEAUTIFUL SHOWER.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.670
IT TOOK ME 55 YEARS TO GET IT.

28:58.704 --> 29:03.509
I WAS ONLY 55 YEARS OLD WHEN I
GOT IT.

29:03.542 --> 29:06.378
MY HOUSE WAS TAKEN FROM ME IN
2008?

29:06.412 --> 29:07.613
>> WHY?

29:07.646 --> 29:10.116
>> MY FATHER WAS IN PRISON, AND
I LOST THE HOUSE BECAUSE I HAD

29:10.149 --> 29:13.352
TO GET MONEY TO PAY FOR HIS
LAWYERS.

29:13.385 --> 29:18.825
THEY SEIZED IT IN FRONT OF ME.

29:18.858 --> 29:22.829
ME AND MY KIDS, THEY HAD TO
LEAVE THE NEIGHBORHOOD THEY GREW

29:22.862 --> 29:24.063
UP.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.632
IT'S TRAUMATIC WHEN YOU SEE YOUR
DAUGHTERS CRYING AND YOU CAN'T

29:26.665 --> 29:27.800
DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.902
MY DAUGHTER WENT TO FRESHMAN
YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL AND STAYED

29:29.936 --> 29:31.603
IN THE LADIES ROOM FOR TWO
MONTHS.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.105
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.540
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

29:34.573 --> 29:36.508
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH
YOURSELF.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.846
YOU'RE READY TO ROB A WEST BANK,
BANK, AND THEN YOU DON'T EVEN

29:39.879 --> 29:40.913
MIND GOING AWAY.

29:40.947 --> 29:44.283
AT LEAST YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN.

29:44.316 --> 29:47.786
EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT THEIR
REASON FOR BEING HERE, MINE IS

29:47.820 --> 29:51.590
FOR MY KIDS AND WIFE, BUT I
DON'T TELL NOBODY THAT HERE.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.893
I DON'T WANT NO ONE FEELING BAD
FOR ME.

29:53.926 --> 29:57.629
I WOULD PAY OFF ALL MY KIDS'
STUDENT LOANS.

29:57.663 --> 30:00.666
I WOULD TAKE THEM ON A VACATION
BECAUSE THEY DESERVE IT.

30:00.699 --> 30:04.703
I WOULD BUY OLIVE YES A CAR AND
JUST MAKE THINGS LATE EASIER.

30:04.736 --> 30:05.371
SIX DAUGHTERS.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.007
SIX DAUGHTERS.

30:08.040 --> 30:12.044
ONE SON.

30:12.078 --> 30:17.383
I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH MONEY
FOR ALL THIS, TRUST ME.

30:17.416 --> 30:20.286
THEY CAN BARELY BEAT ME AT THIS,
AND THIS IS THEIR GAME.

30:20.319 --> 30:26.392
I'M TAKING MY ALOE VARY BACK.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.862
>> WE'RE LIKE A BIG FAMILY IN
HERE, AND LIKE FAMILIES, WE CAN

30:29.896 --> 30:31.197
FIGHT OCCASIONALLY.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.934
>> AND SOME OF US WILL FIGHT
WITH POTS AND PANS.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.269
>> I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.738
NOT ME.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.840
>> DON'T TRY TO GET IN MY FACE.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.242
>> I CAN'T STAND HIM.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.343
I'M TIRED OF HOLDING BACK.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.645
>> CLEARLY THEY BOTH ARE ON THE
BLOCK.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.581
THEY WANT TO CAUSE
CONFRONTATION.

30:49.615 --> 30:51.417
WAH, WAH, WAH.

30:51.450 --> 30:51.984
LOSER.

30:52.018 --> 30:52.952
>> THAT'S WHAT HE DOES.

30:52.985 --> 30:56.022
HE STOMPS AROUND HERE LIKE HE
OWNS THE PLACE.

30:56.055 --> 30:59.791
POOR JESSICA IS CAUGHT IN THE
MIDDLE WITH THAT DOUCHEBAG.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.160
HE SMELLS LIKE A SKUNK.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.494
>> SHUT THE  UP.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.197
>> YOU SHUT THE  UP.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.532
WHY ARE YOU INVOLVING YOURSELF?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.034
YOU WANT TO GET IN IT?

31:08.067 --> 31:09.601
>> SHUT THE  UP.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.403
>> YOU SHUT THE  UP.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.705
WHEN YOU HAD TO STEP UP.

31:13.739 --> 31:15.241
YOU DIDN'T.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.408
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

31:16.442 --> 31:20.046
GO HIDE BEHIND CODY BECAUSE YOU
NEED HIM THE BACK YOU UP.

31:20.079 --> 31:22.949
IF YOU WANT TO GUN FOR ME, I'LL
GO AFTER YOU.

31:22.982 --> 31:23.449
DO IT.

31:23.482 --> 31:24.450
>> I'M WAITING JOSH.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.452
>> I HAVE ALREADY, BUDDY.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.586
YOU PROVED MY POINT.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.021
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO DEFEND CODY.

31:29.055 --> 31:32.458
HE'S A GROWN-ASS MAN.

31:32.491 --> 31:35.661
YOU KNOW WHOSE BACK YOU SHOULD
HAVE HAD, DOMINIQUE.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.196
YOU SHOULD HAVE STOOD UP IN
DOMINIQUE.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.566
YOU WANT TO DEFEND SOMEONE
GETTING IN PEOPLE'S FACES.

31:40.599 --> 31:41.100
YOU'RE A JOKE.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.201
YOU ARE A JOKE.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.636
AND YOU'RE A BIG, FAT BULLY.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.605
>> JOSH, JOSH.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.041
>> CLEARLY.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.010
YOU SUCK.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.678
YOUR PERSONAL SUCKS.

31:52.711 --> 31:58.717
YOU'RE BLAND AS... WHAT'S FUNNY?

31:58.750 --> 32:01.187
>> NOT MUCH.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.722
>> WHAT'S FUNNY?

32:03.755 --> 32:11.463
WHAT'S FUNNY?

32:11.497 --> 32:14.866
PARAGRAPH DON'T TOUCH ME.

CRAZY MOMENTS HAPPENED IN THIS
LIVING ROOM, BUT I'D SAY THE

32:44.963 --> 32:47.299
MOST CRAZY MOMENTS WERE BECAUSE
OF THE DEN OF TEMPTATION.

32:47.333 --> 32:48.500
>> OH, YEAH.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.902
>> WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT ONLY
THREE PEOPLE WERE TEMPTED BY THE

32:50.936 --> 32:56.775
DEN OF TEMPTATION, AND WE'RE ALL
STILL HERE.

32:56.808 --> 33:03.715
>> AMERICA, JESSICA OUT OF ALL
PEOPLE, NOT ME?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.884

THE DEN.

33:21.133 --> 33:25.003

33:34.046 --> 33:37.049
AND THEN ALSO TAKE AWAY FROM
MINE.

33:37.083 --> 33:40.719
AND IT SOUNDS SO
COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT IT'S... IT

33:40.752 --> 33:42.754

MY REPLACEMENT NOMINEE IS PAUL.

NEXT THREE EVICTION THEREFORE I

33:55.401 --> 33:56.768
CANNOT BE NOMINATED.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.838
THIS MEANS YOU'LL HAVE TO PICK A

AMERICA HAS CHOSEN TO TEMPT YOU

34:03.442 --> 34:06.812

35:01.400 --> 35:04.035
ON LIVE EVICTION DAY YOU
REVEALED TO THE HOUSE THAT YOU

35:04.069 --> 35:07.673
HAD SOME SORT OF TEMPTATION, SO
THE FACT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN

35:07.706 --> 35:12.411
REVEALED, I THINK ME AND THE
HOUSE ARE GENUINELY CONFUSED.

35:12.444 --> 35:15.314
I GENUINELY BELIEVED YOU WHEN
YOU HAD SAFETY.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.315
THAT MAY STILL BE THE CASE.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.917
>> YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU JUST
DID, PAUL?

35:18.950 --> 35:20.452
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

35:20.486 --> 35:23.722

SCENARIO FOR YOU.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.358
YOU NOMINATING BOTH OF US, DON'T
EVEN SAY ANYTHING.

35:40.739 --> 35:48.480
>> Julie: NO ONE IS LEAVING
THE HOUSE TONIGHT.

35:48.514 --> 35:52.184
>> SO THE DEN OF TEMPTATION
CAUSED A LOT OF SHOCKED FACES IN

35:52.218 --> 35:55.487
THIS LIVING ROOM, BUT I BET
THERE WAS A LOT OF SHOCKED FACES

35:55.521 --> 35:56.422
IN THAT DIARY ROOM.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.623
