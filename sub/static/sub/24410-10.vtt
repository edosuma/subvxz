00:01.840 --> 00:05.400
What are you going to do?
Do you want to keep it?

00:05.480 --> 00:06.880
I don't know.

00:06.960 --> 00:11.200
Liv, you can't.
I can't be a father again.

00:11.280 --> 00:15.520
If you tell Oskar, I'll lose him.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.040
He may forgive you,
but he'll never forgive me.

00:23.200 --> 00:26.480
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.320
It's not mine.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.560
Who is this?

00:35.640 --> 00:38.000
<i>Patricia Cross, I'm the new producer.</i>

00:38.080 --> 00:41.600
<i>-The last one got fired.</i>
-Okay, I don't understand.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.000
<i>You got the part. You're in.</i>

00:46.440 --> 00:48.800
Yes!

00:53.120 --> 00:57.560
I have some information that might
interest you, about the Waldemars.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.560
Did I tear off the button?

01:07.320 --> 01:09.920
I don't know. Probably.

01:12.720 --> 01:16.680
-What's this?
-It was stuck to his glove.

01:16.760 --> 01:19.360
-From a coat?
-Possibly.

01:37.640 --> 01:43.000
<i>...due to aggravating circumstances</i>
<i>subject to the death penalty,</i>

01:43.080 --> 01:49.920
<i>as is stipulated by laws and statutes</i>
<i>for certain crimes.</i>

01:50.400 --> 01:56.680
<i>Finally, I wish all the citizens</i>
<i>of our town a merry Christmas.</i>

02:02.800 --> 02:06.120
So, now you're free
to do what you want for a while.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.160
-Want to go outside?
-Yeah.

02:10.760 --> 02:14.640
-Dad, let's go to the kitchen.
-Don't sneak off.

02:16.240 --> 02:17.600
When will you tell everyone?

02:19.240 --> 02:23.240
-Do we have to talk about this now?
-You can't hide it for long.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.960
-Do you think today's the right time?
-Why not?

02:27.040 --> 02:29.920
It'll be a Christmas present
for the family.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.480
Please, Oskar.

02:32.560 --> 02:37.320
Both Kim and Cecilia are getting
a sibling. When is it due?

02:37.400 --> 02:40.120
-I know you're hurt.
-Hurt?

02:42.800 --> 02:45.320
It'll be a summer baby, right?

02:45.400 --> 02:48.560
Or maybe you slept together
at the time of the opening?

02:48.640 --> 02:52.320
Then it should be due
during the spring.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.680
I'm not keeping it.

03:02.160 --> 03:05.520
You are keeping it.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.440
I know very well how long
you've wanted more kids.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.800
Not like this.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.840
THICKER THAN WATER

04:29.440 --> 04:32.240
Merry Christmas to all of us
working on Christmas Eve.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.520
Yeah, yeah.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.320
Did you like the snow
when you were a kid?

05:27.400 --> 05:29.600
Don't all kids like the snow?

05:29.680 --> 05:33.680
Yes, but not when you have two
brothers rubbing it in your face.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.520
When are you leaving for London?

05:41.600 --> 05:43.920
After Christmas.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.880
You know when Lasse
and I went to Helsinki?

05:52.960 --> 05:58.080
We didn't really go there
to get insulation.

05:59.600 --> 06:03.840
We went there to launder
the fake money.

06:08.360 --> 06:14.680
You'd broken up with me and I wanted
to leave, but Lasse couldn't pay me.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.960
-It was a way out.
-So you lied to me?

06:19.720 --> 06:26.360
No, I didn't lie.
I just... didn't tell you.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.320
Why are you telling me now?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.520
I don't want to have
any more secrets.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.960
-I want to go with you.
-To London?

06:37.040 --> 06:42.080
If that's not possible, I'll wait for
you here until you get back.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.840
There's no guarantee I'm coming back.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.680
Oh...

06:55.640 --> 06:58.680
God damn it! Come here!

06:58.760 --> 07:02.960
-What are you going to do?
-You'll find out. Come here!

07:07.120 --> 07:10.080
Say you're sorry. Say it.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.240
I want you to come with me to London.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.400
Okay.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.040
Do you think Cecilia will approve of
this?

07:30.120 --> 07:32.680
I hope so.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.360
-Can I help out?
-Do this and I'll go help Cecilia.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.480
Is there anything else?
I'm no good at finicky stuff.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.440
-Have you even tried?
-Can you do some Finnish specialty?

07:48.520 --> 07:50.880
There's always Turnip au gratin.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.840
-Is that the brown goo in the fridge?
-Yeah, have you tried it?

07:55.840 --> 07:58.440
I'll try it if you give this a try.

08:01.120 --> 08:05.440
-What are you doing after New Year's?
-Why?

08:06.840 --> 08:10.880
I have some ideas about fixing up
the place before the summer season.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.360
I could use a good handyman.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.840
I think I'll be in London next year.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.040
Really?

08:21.120 --> 08:25.200
-With Jonna?
-Yeah, she got an acting role.

08:25.280 --> 08:29.520
But don't tell her I told you.
I think she wants to tell everyone.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.240
So you'll be a Londoner?
Not what I expected.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.720
I didn't expect you to stay here.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.520
Cheers.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.080
Not those, let's use the green ones.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.640
-We need to talk.
-Can we do it tomorrow?

09:44.760 --> 09:48.520
Wow, you've made the place look nice.
Can we help out?

09:48.600 --> 09:50.760
You can fold these.

09:50.840 --> 09:54.320
-How do you want them?
-It doesn't matter. However you like.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.320
Of course it matters.
I want a perfect Christmas here.

09:57.400 --> 10:00.280
-Finally someone who cares.
-We all care.

10:00.360 --> 10:04.120
Sure, last year we
had pizza on Christmas Eve.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.960
We had had Christmas food all month.

10:07.040 --> 10:12.000
-Make up for it by being Santa.
-No, no way.

10:12.080 --> 10:15.120
-You promised me on Skype.
-I was kidding.

10:15.200 --> 10:17.000
-What's this about?
-Lasse being Santa.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.640
No. No kids, no Santa.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.440
Dad?

11:15.520 --> 11:17.080
Dad?

11:18.120 --> 11:22.080
-Aren't you eating with us?
-Yeah.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.120
Are you okay?
Do you want me to wait for you?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.800
Yeah, let's go eat.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.040
Never mind, let's just drink.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.960
-Nice place settings.
-Really nice.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.160
Thanks.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.200
She never said anything.
Have you thought about that?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.480
-Who?
-Mum.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.880
She never stood up for us.
She never intervened.

12:03.880 --> 12:08.920
She went into the office and
closed the door until he was done.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.760
Then she'd let you in
and comfort you.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.160
Maybe we could skip this
on Christmas Eve?

12:16.240 --> 12:19.720
-You wanted a Waldemar Christmas.
-Not now, Oskar.

12:21.400 --> 12:27.000
You know what? I think it's time for
Lasse to go out and buy a newspaper.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.120
-Yes!
-No, no, no. I said no.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.200
No...

12:45.000 --> 12:47.680
I didn't even know you'd
auditioned for a role.

12:47.760 --> 12:53.080
Not many people knew.
Kim was the only one.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.920
-When are you going to London?
-On Boxing Day.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.880
Since this has become
a moment of truth,

13:05.960 --> 13:09.640
I have something I want to tell you.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.440
A family secret.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.400
It needs to be surfaced
before it drags us all down.

13:21.480 --> 13:23.800
-Sit down, Oskar.
-No, I'm not sitting down!

13:26.440 --> 13:30.160
First of all, Jonna,
congrats on the role.

13:31.160 --> 13:37.360
I won't steal your limelight, Jonna,
but this needs to be said.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.200
Liv is pregnant.

13:45.920 --> 13:51.800
I want to take this opportunity
to say congratulations, Liv.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.640
And congratulations, Lasse.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.040
I understand if you hate me.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.360
What I've done is unforgivable.

14:52.520 --> 14:56.240
I should have told you right away,
but...

14:56.320 --> 15:00.920
You were just so down in the dumps.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.120
I didn't want to bring
you down even more.

15:04.800 --> 15:11.720
For the first time in 20 years,
it feels like we've reconnected.

15:11.800 --> 15:16.960
Like we're brothers again.
I don't want to lose that.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.560
You haven't lost anything, Lasse.

15:24.640 --> 15:25.560
I forgive you.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.160
It's all so simple when
you don't care anymore.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.120
You haven't lost anything.
There was never anything to lose.

15:43.200 --> 15:44.400
It was all a lie.

15:46.720 --> 15:51.160
We were never brothers again,
not really.

15:52.680 --> 15:55.240
And we never will be.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.520
Oskar... Oskar!

15:59.600 --> 16:03.440
Don't do this. Please, don't do this.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.200
I'll do anything. I'll do anything.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.160
What do you want me to do?

16:10.240 --> 16:14.640
I want... you to let me go.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.080
"From Cecilia to Dad."

17:03.480 --> 17:07.520
Sweetie...
Come and let me give you a kiss.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.840
It's really nice, thanks.

17:14.560 --> 17:16.800
Thanks.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.600
Thanks, sweetie.

17:24.360 --> 17:28.240
-Look.
-I didn't know that...

17:29.000 --> 17:33.760
I'll get to keep this, right?
You wouldn't want this.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.000
Or should we split it down the
middle, to make it fair?

17:39.080 --> 17:43.720
-Cecilia, can you tidy the kitchen?
-Yeah.

17:50.240 --> 17:55.280
I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm staying
with my parents for a while.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.040
-Cecilia stays here.
-If she wants to.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.360
I won't force her to do anything.

18:03.440 --> 18:06.160
But I have to leave.
I can't take this anymore.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.240
I'm going to bed. Are you sleeping
with me in the big house?

18:13.320 --> 18:16.200
No, I'm staying.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.200
Okay. Good night, sweetie.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.720
You know where to find me.

18:25.120 --> 18:28.040
-Sleep tight.
-Shut up.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.920
Time to put it up on the wall.

18:36.160 --> 18:39.280
Here's good... Ugly thing.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.880
Dad, please stop.

18:43.120 --> 18:45.680
Dad?

18:45.760 --> 18:49.560
The nail... Hold this. There.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.920
I can't get it out.
Just hand it to me, Cecilia...

19:01.800 --> 19:04.120
Cecilia, what are you doing?

19:04.200 --> 19:07.320
What are you doing?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.160
What's happened to you?

19:11.960 --> 19:13.920
I have to fix it...

19:15.200 --> 19:19.440
-You're pathetic.
-Watch it, Cecilia.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.360
Or you'll end up like your mother.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.880
And you're just like your dad.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.840
Cecilia?

19:48.040 --> 19:54.080
Grandma said you were like him, and
he's not someone you want to be like.

19:55.640 --> 20:00.360
I have always defended you.
I didn't see it.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.640
Not until now.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.200
I'm going with Mom tomorrow.
I think it's for the best.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.120
This isn't you.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.360
The investigation is being
cleared up, Lasse.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.800
-What investigation?
-Your uncle's death.

21:03.880 --> 21:07.360
Oh, okay. So it was an accident?

21:08.160 --> 21:12.760
I don't know, Lasse. Was it?

21:12.840 --> 21:16.680
What do you mean? Am I a suspect?

21:17.880 --> 21:20.440
No, not you.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.920
-Jonna.
-Merry Christmas.

21:39.760 --> 21:43.760
He threatened your family, didn't he?
Konrad.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.520
Was that why you shot him?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.880
He threatened to reveal everything.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.640
That it was Oskar who
killed your dad.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.000
So you shot him.

22:19.920 --> 22:21.600
I planned wait until after
Christmas,

22:21.680 --> 22:24.680
but now that I know
about your plans...

22:27.880 --> 22:32.840
You can't go to London, Jonna. I'll
see you for questioning tomorrow.

22:34.800 --> 22:37.520
Do you understand what I'm saying?

23:48.080 --> 23:52.000
-What time is it?
-I need to go home.

23:52.080 --> 23:53.480
I need to pack some stuff.

24:01.920 --> 24:02.880
Hey...

24:05.680 --> 24:06.560
I love you.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.360
I know.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.600
I'll pick you up later.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.800
It's better if we meet
at the airport.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.280
Okay.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.120
Bye.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.440
She knows that I shot Konrad.

24:53.240 --> 24:55.200
She's coming to get me later.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.360
-Did you confess?
-It doesn't matter.

25:13.000 --> 25:17.160
Jonna, she doesn't have any evidence.
They don't have anything.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.600
-If we just keep quiet...
-No.

25:22.760 --> 25:24.560
I'm so tired, Lasse.

25:26.440 --> 25:28.960
I can't lie anymore.

25:29.800 --> 25:32.640
Do you understand? I'm not like you.

25:35.920 --> 25:38.920
I've only tried to take care of you.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.160
So stop it.

26:12.480 --> 26:15.080
Hi, it's Lasse.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.320
I need to see you.

26:24.040 --> 26:25.280
Did Wille leave?

26:25.360 --> 26:29.240
Yes. He thinks we're going to London.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.720
I just couldn't tell him.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.760
-You're usually brutally honest.
-Yes, but he was so happy.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.480
It was worth lying this time.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.120
You've become a true Waldemar.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.680
Yes.

26:55.080 --> 26:59.640
-I'm sorry, Oskar.
-What? Sorry about what?

26:59.720 --> 27:04.760
About everything.
For denying the past.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.800
For being a coward
and hiding in the attic.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.560
What are you talking about?
We sent you up there.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.520
-What?
-To the attic.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.760
We chased you up there,
so you wouldn't have to see things.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.280
But why?

27:26.360 --> 27:27.680
It's what big brothers do.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.120
I'm the one who shot him.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.800
We started fighting about
the money I gave him.

27:50.880 --> 27:54.800
He accused me of trying
to set him up.

27:54.880 --> 27:58.480
I tried to grab his rifle...

27:58.560 --> 28:02.040
It was an accident. He fell in the
water and we tried to pull him up.

28:02.120 --> 28:05.800
-And what did Jonna do?
-She didn't do anything.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.400
-Oskar?
-Nothing.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.960
Okay.

28:12.040 --> 28:15.160
So when I bring Jonna in
for questioning,

28:15.240 --> 28:17.480
she won't admit anything?

28:18.040 --> 28:22.720
And we won't find gunpowder
residue on her coat?

28:27.520 --> 28:32.680
Do you think I'm stupid, Lasse? Don't
you think I know when you're lying?

28:32.760 --> 28:35.560
I have to try to protect them.

28:35.640 --> 28:39.600
-By lying?
-By doing what it takes!

28:40.640 --> 28:42.400
You of all people should understand.

28:42.480 --> 28:46.280
Konrad pointed his gun at us, at
Oskar. Jonna just tried to...

28:46.360 --> 28:49.400
She just tried to protect us.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.200
It was an accident.

28:55.120 --> 28:59.240
I've made so fucking many mistakes.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.280
I left them behind when
they were kids.

29:06.360 --> 29:10.400
You're right.
I let other people take the hits.

29:11.720 --> 29:14.280
But I can't do that now.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.160
Jonna is an adult.
She'll have to face her own actions.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.080
I got her into this fix.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.560
Now I have to get her out of it.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.760
She's so close to getting
everything she's dreamed of.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.840
Am I supposed to take
that away from her?

29:31.920 --> 29:35.440
You can't do her time for her.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.040
Will you be gone long?

30:13.120 --> 30:17.400
Until Cecilia goes back to Stockholm.
Then we'll see.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.680
Mum and I get on each other's
nerves after a while.

30:22.360 --> 30:26.400
What are you...?
What are you going to do?

30:28.120 --> 30:31.240
We'll see. I haven't decided yet.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.520
I have something for you.

30:37.440 --> 30:41.400
-A late Christmas present?
-A late something.

30:42.440 --> 30:45.960
-Open it later.
-Okay.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.400
I'm guessing an espresso machine.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.480
Yeah, or maybe a time machine.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.000
Liv, I need to ask you a favour.

31:03.400 --> 31:06.640
-Can you take Kim when you go?
-Isn't she leaving tonight?

31:06.720 --> 31:11.400
-I changed her ticket.
-The taxi is here. Has she packed?

31:11.480 --> 31:16.320
I packed for her.
Please, she needs to go now.

31:16.400 --> 31:20.440
What's all this about?
What are you planning?

31:23.040 --> 31:26.040
Don't ask. I can't lie
to you anymore.

31:27.160 --> 31:33.920
I hope that will make you realise
that you were never replaceable.

31:35.320 --> 31:40.520
I mean it. I still mean it,
every word.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.920
So why don't you leave with me?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.880
I want to.

31:56.280 --> 32:00.480
You have no idea how much.
But I can't.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.360
Mum? The taxi's waiting.

32:57.560 --> 33:00.440
I don't understand
why I have to leave now.

33:00.520 --> 33:05.440
Your mum wanted you there tonight.

33:05.520 --> 33:07.280
Okay.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.400
Kim... I love you.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.240
I love you, too,
but I'm coming back in a few days.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.960
Bye.

34:25.720 --> 34:28.880
I have to leave for a while.

34:31.760 --> 34:35.080
But I know I'm leaving the place
in good hands.

34:36.920 --> 34:42.440
And if you want to, we can
run it together when I get back.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.480
This is for you.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.480
You'll understand...

34:54.560 --> 34:58.400
I don't give a shit if you
come back this time.

34:58.960 --> 35:04.760
Do you know what it's been like
to be the one forced to stay here?

35:04.840 --> 35:07.120
Here, Lasse.

35:08.680 --> 35:13.440
Taking responsibility, but it was
you everyone was waiting for.

35:14.920 --> 35:18.720
Mum never wanted me
to run this place.

35:18.800 --> 35:23.960
She just wanted me to
take care of it.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.040
Until you deigned to come back.

35:27.120 --> 35:31.240
I was just some temporary solution.

35:31.320 --> 35:36.080
It was you she wanted.
And the same goes for my wife.

35:39.160 --> 35:41.760
She was never mine.

35:42.800 --> 35:45.400
This was never mine.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.120
I'll tell you something, Lasse.

35:54.600 --> 35:58.400
I'm sick of taking care of things
while you're gone.

36:00.600 --> 36:03.320
I saw Rosén today.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.880
Jonna and I are selling our shares.

36:06.960 --> 36:12.160
So go, Lasse. There's nothing here
for you to come back to.

38:05.080 --> 38:09.680
IT'S YOURS NOW,
UNTIL YOU WANT IT TO BE OURS AGAIN.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.120
DEED OF GIFT

38:22.840 --> 38:24.280
Is it time?

38:47.480 --> 38:49.680
What's going on?

38:54.040 --> 38:56.040
What did you do?

38:56.120 --> 38:59.200
Everything will be fine, Jonna.

39:14.320 --> 39:16.680
Lasse?

39:31.000 --> 39:33.040
Lasse!

39:35.440 --> 39:37.440
Drive.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.240
Lasse!

40:31.320 --> 40:33.600
<i>Dear Liv,</i>

40:34.720 --> 40:39.480
<i>you wanted to know what was in the</i>
<i>letter I wrote you when I left Åland.</i>

40:41.200 --> 40:44.840
<i>So here it is, word for word</i>
<i>as best as I can recall.</i>

40:44.920 --> 40:47.680
<i>Twenty years too late.</i>

40:47.760 --> 40:53.560
<i>But I promise you,</i>
<i>I still feel the same way I did then.</i>

42:00.280 --> 42:01.600
I love you.

42:03.720 --> 42:04.800
I know.

42:06.920 --> 42:10.760
<i>This is the final call for</i>
<i>Air Åland...</i>

43:09.000 --> 43:12.000
