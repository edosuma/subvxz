Let's go to Rey's.
I'm starving.

Move. Uh, but Mom's
coming to get us, I think.

01:22.648 --> 01:24.884
No. Mom texted. She said
she's gonna be working late.

01:24.917 --> 01:26.519

-Don't what?
I'm just being helpful.
-Just don't.

-No, you're not
being helpful.
-Yes, I am.

-You're being bossy.
-I'm not.

you may be taller,

not to mention older.

02:00.719 --> 02:02.922
Oh, I don't know, maybe--

02:02.955 --> 02:04.789
maybe it's 'cause
you're so fucking bossy.

02:04.823 --> 02:06.592
Whatever.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.261

02:08.294 --> 02:09.929
Listen, the deadline
is next week, okay?

02:09.961 --> 02:11.831
I applied for two scholarships,
dance and cheer.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.566
You have to apply
for at least one.

[Tal] What? I'm not good enough
to get a dance scholarship.

02:15.568 --> 02:18.237
[Janelle] You're just
too afraid to audition.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.705
Well, you're gonna have
to get over it, okay?

02:19.738 --> 02:20.907
Because we're going
to Ohio State,

02:20.940 --> 02:22.475
then we're going to LA
to be dancers.

You dance to perform,
I dance for me.

02:29.248 --> 02:30.549
[Janelle] What do you mean?
I think that

02:30.583 --> 02:31.951
-that is so selfish, Tal.
-How is that selfish?

to us?

High Water?

And what business
is it of yours?

19:39.777 --> 19:41.546

19:41.579 --> 19:42.647
Sage Odom's High Water
is here?

19:42.680 --> 19:43.949
They all go there.

19:47.652 --> 19:48.753
He's talking about
High Water.

19:48.786 --> 19:50.255
Sage Odom's school
is here, Tal.

19:50.288 --> 19:52.958
-What?
-All right. Look, we got to go.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.260

this was amazing.

directors, performance artists,

20:51.949 --> 20:53.852
singers, designers,
and this week,

20:53.885 --> 20:56.021
they're auditioning dancers,
okay? We have to go.

20:56.054 --> 20:57.622
I've never auditioned
for anything, okay?

20:57.655 --> 20:58.923
-You know that.
-Don't you see it?

20:58.956 --> 21:00.992
Maybe all this happened
for a reason.

21:01.025 --> 21:03.461
You think there's
a good reason Mom relapsed

21:03.494 --> 21:05.062
and went to jail
and we ended up here?

21:05.096 --> 21:06.464
No, I'm not saying that.

21:06.497 --> 21:08.033
-I'm saying...
-What?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.801
Can't I just be excited
about something?

21:09.834 --> 21:12.470
[Tal] J, these people are
the best of the best, all right?

21:12.503 --> 21:14.673
They're practically
professionals. Let it go.

21:14.706 --> 21:16.507
[Janelle] Look, I know
all of that, but you know me.

21:16.541 --> 21:17.575
I at least have to try.

21:17.608 --> 21:19.577
[Tal] Yeah, I know.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.046
Good luck convincing Uncle Al.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.715
Yeah, well,
even Uncle Al has to see

21:23.748 --> 21:25.651
what an amazing opportunity
this is.

21:33.424 --> 21:35.327
[sighs]

22:16.934 --> 22:19.404
[gasps] Fuck.
Can't you knock?

22:19.437 --> 22:20.839
Tal, get your ass dressed.

22:24.008 --> 22:25.010
God.

22:27.512 --> 22:29.880
No diploma? What good is it
if there's no diploma?

22:29.914 --> 22:31.383
[Janelle] High Water
is pre-professional.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.051
It prepares you to make
a living an artist.

22:33.084 --> 22:34.386
[Uncle Al] The only thing
they can prepare you

22:34.419 --> 22:35.820
making a living as an artist

22:35.853 --> 22:37.756
is if you win the lotto.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.858
So, I suggest you work
on your education.

22:39.891 --> 22:42.394
We will see what college
we can get you into.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.828
I don't wanna
go to college.

22:43.861 --> 22:45.663
[Tal] Yeah. But you did apply
for a scholarship

22:45.696 --> 22:47.399
at Ohio State, so...

22:47.432 --> 22:49.601
But college is not gonna
get me where I wanna go.

22:49.634 --> 22:51.035
High Water is.

22:51.068 --> 22:52.404
It's the chance
I've been busting my ass

22:52.437 --> 22:53.504
for my entire life.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.939
I just need
your approval.

22:54.972 --> 22:56.608
[chuckles] You familiar
with that show

22:56.641 --> 22:57.909

a Millionaire?</i>

22:57.942 --> 23:01.846
-Of course.
-My final answer is hell no.

23:01.879 --> 23:03.581
You tell them people
get them a diploma,

23:03.614 --> 23:04.916
then we talk.

23:06.984 --> 23:08.520
[Tal] Please don't
do this.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.622
[Janelle] Tal,
if I don't at least try,

23:10.655 --> 23:12.524
I will hate myself
for the rest of my life.

23:14.225 --> 23:16.628
Well, if Uncle Al
finds out

23:16.661 --> 23:18.163
and we get split up,

23:18.196 --> 23:19.798
I'll hate you
for the rest of your life.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.733
-Tal...
-We had a plan.

23:21.766 --> 23:24.536
This is the plan.
Don't you see?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.806
We wanted to get to New York
to dance, to be famous.

23:27.839 --> 23:30.073
Who is more famous
than Sage Odom?

23:30.107 --> 23:32.644
Yeah, but Uncle Al
could really throw us out.

23:32.677 --> 23:35.179
[Janelle] Uncle Al
is not gonna throw us out.

23:35.213 --> 23:36.981
I only need his approval
if I get in,

23:37.014 --> 23:38.783
and even you said it,

23:38.816 --> 23:39.618
what are the odds of that?

23:41.919 --> 23:43.755
Just cover for me
for one day.

23:43.788 --> 23:45.957
Oh, come on, Janelle.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.168
Stay away from the cute boy.

23:57.201 --> 23:58.636
And if you see
the mean girl,

23:58.669 --> 24:00.171
run like hell.

24:00.204 --> 24:01.973
We get a call tonight
with Mom at 7:00,

24:02.006 --> 24:04.476
so don't be late,
all right? I mean it.

24:06.777 --> 24:08.180
Kill it.

24:09.514 --> 24:10.482
Thank you.

25:05.703 --> 25:07.205
[Greeter] Hi. Are you here
for the dance orientation?

25:07.238 --> 25:08.740
Yes. Janelle Baker.

25:08.773 --> 25:10.608
All right.

25:10.641 --> 25:12.544
Janelle, it looks like
your online registration

25:12.577 --> 25:14.212
-is complete.
-Uh-hmm.

25:14.245 --> 25:16.313
So today we're gonna
have a tour of High Water,

25:16.347 --> 25:18.216
followed by a showcase
from our current students.

25:18.249 --> 25:21.085
Tomorrow, the audition
process begins.

25:21.118 --> 25:22.854
For now, just step over there
with the applicants.

25:22.887 --> 25:24.121
Okay. Thank you.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.591
Sorry.

25:28.859 --> 25:30.727
Oh, man.

25:30.761 --> 25:31.896
This is insane.

25:31.929 --> 25:33.097
Yeah. I know, right?

25:33.130 --> 25:34.599
I'd kill to meet Sage Odom.

25:34.632 --> 25:36.634
I mean, a chance to learn
from that dude?

25:36.667 --> 25:37.735
That shit's crazy.

25:37.768 --> 25:39.337
I'm Janelle.

25:39.370 --> 25:41.238
-Davis.
-Hi. Odalie.

25:41.272 --> 25:43.640
[Janelle]
Nice to meet you.

25:43.674 --> 25:45.643
I just found out
about auditions yesterday.

25:45.676 --> 25:48.013
Really? I've been rehearsing
for about a year.

25:49.947 --> 25:52.116
I didn't mean to sound
like I'm freaking you out.

25:52.149 --> 25:53.918
-It's okay.
-[man] Everyone,
please follow me.

25:53.951 --> 25:55.787
Shit, my group's
leaving me.

25:55.820 --> 25:56.888
I'll catch up with you guys
in a bit, all right?

25:56.921 --> 25:59.591
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.359
-I'm sorry...
-He's cute.

26:02.693 --> 26:03.895
Good morning.

26:03.928 --> 26:05.263
You must be my group.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.632
Welcome to High Water.

26:07.665 --> 26:09.100
Well, as you know,
we are not a traditional

26:09.133 --> 26:10.935
&quot;art school.&quot;

26:10.968 --> 26:13.137
We don't have grades,
or diplomas.

26:13.170 --> 26:14.906
Instead, we focus
on teaching you

26:14.939 --> 26:16.341
everything that you will need

26:16.374 --> 26:18.743
to succeed as an artist
in today's world.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.913
Now, we accept artists
16 to 25.

26:21.946 --> 26:24.282
Is there anyone here
who is under 18?

26:24.315 --> 26:25.884
-I am.
-Yeah, me too.

26:27.284 --> 26:29.687
Okay, well, I hope
that you're all aware

26:29.720 --> 26:31.923
that if you don't already have
your high school diploma,

26:31.956 --> 26:33.091
you're gonna need
to get it online

26:33.124 --> 26:34.225
or pass the GED.

26:34.258 --> 26:35.960
-Mm-hmm.
-[boy] Great.

The fashion department

26:42.199 --> 26:44.769
is integral to every
other department here.

26:44.802 --> 26:47.071
Designers learn the basics
of creating costumes

26:47.104 --> 26:49.007
for all kinds of performances.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.241
The videography program focuses

26:50.274 --> 26:51.908
on direction and editing.

26:51.942 --> 26:53.378
You will be relying
on the students

26:53.411 --> 26:55.947

to help you create dance

26:55.980 --> 26:58.950

27:36.454 --> 27:39.157
And other dogs can sense it,
so they attack them.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.958
You can't take a greyhound
to a dog park,

27:40.991 --> 27:43.928

go after them.

30:30.928 --> 30:32.296
Hello.

30:32.329 --> 30:33.464
If you haven't met me yet,

30:33.497 --> 30:35.099
I am Collette Jones,

30:35.132 --> 30:37.235
and I am the head of High Water.

30:37.268 --> 30:40.238
That great piece was created
by three of our students,

30:40.271 --> 30:43.341
King, Rigo, and Poppy.

30:43.374 --> 30:45.209
Here at High Water,

30:45.242 --> 30:47.043
we believe in the value of gifts

30:47.077 --> 30:49.480
and the power of hard work.

30:49.513 --> 30:52.917
But most importantly,
we believe in collaboration.

30:52.950 --> 30:54.452
Now, this isn't just
an institution

30:54.485 --> 30:56.387
for dancing or singing,

30:56.420 --> 30:58.423
creation,
or even performance.

30:59.623 --> 31:02.293
High Water
is purposed to develop

31:02.326 --> 31:05.563
and strengthen
your gifts in here,

31:05.596 --> 31:07.965
so that you can be

31:09.600 --> 31:12.570
[cheers and applause]

31:14.338 --> 31:15.874
Okay, any questions?

31:18.309 --> 31:20.578
How often is Sage Odom here?

31:20.611 --> 31:23.214
Do we ever get to perform
for him in person?

31:24.381 --> 31:26.284
We get that
question a lot,

31:26.317 --> 31:29.186
and while High Water
definitely is Sage's vision,

31:29.219 --> 31:30.454
he is a very busy man

31:30.487 --> 31:31.656
and so his time
is limited.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.391
Next question?

31:33.424 --> 31:35.359
[Sage]
I wouldn't necessarily say that.

31:35.392 --> 31:38.296
[cheers and applause]

31:50.641 --> 31:52.343
[Sage] I mean,
you do have a point

31:52.376 --> 31:54.979
with my time being limited,
and I am a very busy man

31:55.012 --> 31:57.682
but, you know, I can always
make time for a little...

31:57.715 --> 32:00.083
[crowd cheering]

32:00.117 --> 32:02.119
May I?

32:02.152 --> 32:03.988
[clears throat]

32:04.021 --> 32:05.456
Future of High Water,
make some noise.

32:05.489 --> 32:10.194
[crowd cheering]

32:10.227 --> 32:12.096
As of late, I've been doing
a lot of interviews

32:12.129 --> 32:14.165
about High Water
and what we're doing here.

32:14.198 --> 32:18.636
And it would seem
that they take every opportunity

32:18.669 --> 32:21.005
to downplay
what is happening here.

32:21.038 --> 32:22.440
Asking me questions like,

32:22.473 --> 32:25.676
&quot;Is this a vanity project?&quot;

32:25.709 --> 32:27.345
Mind you, when I say them,
I'm talking about that they,

32:27.378 --> 32:29.179
the they that you're
thinking of right now, you.

32:29.213 --> 32:31.682
They don't want you
to have art centers,

32:31.715 --> 32:34.284
they don't want you
to have afterschool programs,

32:34.318 --> 32:35.653
they wanna keep you stupid

32:35.686 --> 32:37.588
by having bullshit music

32:37.621 --> 32:40.057
and reality TV
in constant rotation.

32:40.090 --> 32:41.759
These are the people
that keep asking me

32:41.792 --> 32:44.328
this same question,
this same dumbass question,

32:44.361 --> 32:47.765
&quot;Sage Odom,
is this a vanity project?&quot;

32:47.798 --> 32:50.568
A question to which I,
in my most friendliest tone,

32:50.601 --> 32:52.570
respond with, &quot;Fuck no.&quot;

32:52.603 --> 32:54.305
[laughter]

32:54.338 --> 32:56.139
[Sage] No, this is not
a vanity a project.

32:56.173 --> 32:58.242
What this is, is a mission,

32:58.275 --> 33:00.211
to get the art
back to the people

33:00.244 --> 33:02.178
through the actual artists.

33:02.212 --> 33:04.716
[cheers and applause]

33:06.717 --> 33:08.386
[Sage] So the answer
to the question,

33:08.419 --> 33:10.187
&quot;Will Sage Odom be around
this semester?&quot;

33:10.220 --> 33:12.323
You damn right
I'm-a be around this semester!

33:12.356 --> 33:15.059
[crowd cheering]

33:15.092 --> 33:17.194
[Sage] Now, the ones
that I find special,

33:17.227 --> 33:18.796
students that I find special,

33:18.829 --> 33:21.732
I will personally select you
to work with me.

33:21.765 --> 33:24.368
-[crowd cheering]
-[Sage] Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

33:24.401 --> 33:26.537
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

33:26.570 --> 33:29.040
Because see, the students
that I find lacking,

33:29.073 --> 33:32.043
I will personally walk
your ass out that front door

33:32.076 --> 33:33.711
and make sure
that you are not in the way

33:33.744 --> 33:35.713
for someone
that deserves to be here.

33:35.746 --> 33:37.681
Do we understand each other?

33:37.714 --> 33:39.783
Do we understand
each other?

33:39.817 --> 33:42.387
[cheers and applause]

33:46.557 --> 33:48.559
Enough talk,
we got work to do.

33:48.592 --> 33:50.061
I'll see you
this semester!

33:50.094 --> 33:53.031
[crowd cheering]

33:56.767 --> 33:59.170
Okay, so the fragrance
company call,

33:59.203 --> 34:01.205
that needs to happen now,
or it's not happening.

34:01.238 --> 34:02.406
-Got it.
-[Sage] Did they--

34:02.439 --> 34:03.674
-did they call you?
-Hey. Hi.

34:03.707 --> 34:05.476
-Hey.
-[Collette] Hi.

34:05.509 --> 34:06.710
There she is.
God, you look amazing.

34:06.743 --> 34:07.711
-How you've been?
-[Collette] Thank you.

34:07.744 --> 34:09.513
-[Sage] Come here. Ahh!
-Thanks.

34:09.545 --> 34:10.748
[Collette] Okay.

34:10.781 --> 34:12.315
[Sage] Good to see you.

34:12.349 --> 34:14.485
[Collette] Look, do you
wanna explain to me...

34:14.518 --> 34:15.686
-Sage...
-...why you blew into town

34:15.719 --> 34:17.688
and ambushed me on stage

34:17.721 --> 34:20.291
and announced that
you were taking over?

34:20.324 --> 34:22.426
Thank you.
Not taking over,

34:22.458 --> 34:23.726
just a little spark,
that's all.

34:23.760 --> 34:24.762
But we do have a lot
to talk about,

34:24.795 --> 34:26.563
so I feel like
we should maybe...

34:26.597 --> 34:27.665
-Okay, so when?
-[cell phone buzzing]

34:27.697 --> 34:28.899
What are you
doing in town?

34:28.933 --> 34:32.436
I'm gonna-- all right, I--okay,
I got to take this but, um,

34:32.469 --> 34:34.672
uh, dinner tomorrow night,

34:34.705 --> 34:37.141
10:00, my hotel. Yes?

34:37.174 --> 34:38.275
Good.

34:38.308 --> 34:39.342
[Collette] Thanks.

34:39.376 --> 34:41.411
Whatever.

34:41.445 --> 34:43.147
[sighs] Okay.

34:45.349 --> 34:47.818
[man] Six buffalo dry,
six nuclear wet

34:47.851 --> 34:49.587
-with blue cheese.
-[Tal] Six, six dry?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.322
-Got it. Right, okay.
-Okay?

34:51.355 --> 34:53.524
Straight legs. I don't fuck
with the flat parts, all right?

34:53.556 --> 34:54.792
And I do want
the little leg part.

34:54.824 --> 34:56.627
Okay, well, they're wings.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.895
They'll be arm parts, right?

34:58.929 --> 35:00.131
[man] You're getting
smart with me, man?

35:00.164 --> 35:01.432
-What?
-You catching some type

35:01.465 --> 35:02.800
-of attitude, dawg?
-No, man. I...

35:02.833 --> 35:04.835
[man] Hey, where
your manager at, man?

35:04.868 --> 35:06.337
-Bring your manager out here.
-Oh, man.

35:06.370 --> 35:07.770
All right, I need
some real help

35:07.804 --> 35:09.640
before I Yelp trash
this bitch.

35:09.673 --> 35:12.243
[Uncle Al] What's up,
Straight-Leg Ray?
Go take out the trash.

35:12.276 --> 35:14.444
[man] Doesn't make
no sense, man.

35:14.478 --> 35:15.679
What can I get you right now?

35:15.712 --> 35:18.182
The same thing
I get every time.

35:18.215 --> 35:20.518
-Six buffalo dry.
-[Uncle Al] Right, right.

35:20.551 --> 35:21.886
-Six nuclear wet.
-[Uncle Al] Right, straight up.

35:30.861 --> 35:32.696
[Marquise]
What up, East-O?

35:37.668 --> 35:39.870
[East-O]
So, Marquise, man,

35:39.903 --> 35:43.207
I hear on the street
you pumping something
serious out here.

35:43.240 --> 35:44.841
[Marquise] You already know
how we do it, right?

35:44.875 --> 35:47.411
[East-O] Yeah, I see,
I see. I see.

35:47.444 --> 35:48.746
You know, like,

35:48.779 --> 35:50.481
people are telling me,
like, &quot;East-O,

35:50.514 --> 35:53.551
you need to put
this high school boy
down for a job.&quot;

35:53.584 --> 35:55.819
And I'm thinking

35:55.852 --> 35:58.788
you already worked
for me, right?

36:01.391 --> 36:04.962
Yo, now, you got
your side hustle

36:04.995 --> 36:07.330
and you didn't even
tell your boy?

36:07.364 --> 36:08.566
How do you think
that makes me feel?

36:09.766 --> 36:10.935
East, look.

36:12.703 --> 36:15.239
[Marquise]
No, yo, East-- Aah!

36:15.272 --> 36:17.908
[East-O] I'm talking
to you, motherfucker.

36:17.941 --> 36:20.944
-[Marquise] Look, man.
-[East-O] Shut the fuck up.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.413
You hear me
when I'm talking to you?

36:22.446 --> 36:23.881
Ah, shit.

36:26.416 --> 36:27.518
Huh?

36:27.551 --> 36:29.653
Huh? Huh?

36:29.686 --> 36:31.655
Huh? Huh? Huh?

36:31.688 --> 36:33.624
[gasps]

36:33.657 --> 36:34.525
Didn't I tell you

36:34.558 --> 36:36.493
this is not Ohio?

36:36.526 --> 36:37.694
You see something,

36:37.728 --> 36:39.730
-you look the other way.
-Yes, sir.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.368
[sighs] I got
one goddamn job,

36:44.401 --> 36:45.603
that's keeping you alive.

36:45.636 --> 36:46.904
One goddamn job.

36:46.937 --> 36:48.739
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

36:48.772 --> 36:49.907
Be smart.

36:51.441 --> 36:52.810
Okay.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.345
I've been a parent
for 15 minutes.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.579
I don't like this shit.

36:55.612 --> 36:57.281
Be smarter, man.

37:01.618 --> 37:03.254
[Davis] I still can't get
over Sage Odom.

37:03.287 --> 37:05.455
[Janelle] I thought
I was gonna faint.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.758
I mean, that dude
could be off doing whatever
the hell he wants.

37:07.791 --> 37:08.792
Well, it's crazy
he even spends time

37:08.825 --> 37:09.993
with people like us.

37:10.027 --> 37:11.595
I mean, people
from his 'hood

37:11.628 --> 37:13.297
who don't have anything.

37:13.330 --> 37:14.665
[Janelle] That whole showcase
thing was next level.

37:14.698 --> 37:16.299
-[Davis] Yeah.
-[Odalie] Yeah. We have to be

37:16.333 --> 37:19.336
as good as every dancer
on that stage today.

37:19.369 --> 37:20.804
What do you know?
It's The Mighty Hannibal.

37:20.837 --> 37:23.607
You like the
old school stuff?

37:23.640 --> 37:26.042
Yeah. My pops used to have
a sick vinyl collection.

37:26.076 --> 37:27.945
He used to play records
every Sunday morning.

37:27.978 --> 37:29.580
-Dope.
-It was kind of like church.

37:29.613 --> 37:30.913
[Janelle]
That sounds like fun.

37:30.947 --> 37:31.915
You should have us
over some time.

37:31.948 --> 37:33.417
Maybe we'll get
the spirit.

37:33.450 --> 37:34.952
[Davis]
Yeah, I would but, um,

37:34.985 --> 37:37.588
we lost the records
in a move, so...

37:41.625 --> 37:43.894
You know, I used to use
a lot of old music back home,

37:43.927 --> 37:46.297
you know, when I
choreographed routines.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.432
Wait, you choreographed?

37:48.465 --> 37:49.633
What, like for a company?

37:49.666 --> 37:51.468
Oh, no.
For, like, cheerleading.

37:51.501 --> 37:52.936
Don't laugh.

37:52.969 --> 37:54.471
[chuckles]

37:54.504 --> 37:56.440
I know people don't look
at cheerleading

37:56.473 --> 37:58.709
as dancing exactly, but...

37:58.742 --> 37:59.677
No, I have mad respect.

37:59.710 --> 38:00.811
I do.

38:00.844 --> 38:02.446
I mean,
if you led your squad

38:02.479 --> 38:04.048
that means you know
how it is to work.

38:04.081 --> 38:06.884
Well, ladies, I got
to get going, okay?

38:06.917 --> 38:09.086
-We got a big day tomorrow.
-Oh, yes.

38:09.119 --> 38:12.323
-I'm gonna get a refill.
-Okay. Cool.

Tal, you are not

40:40.203 --> 40:41.971
I've got to get
into this place!

40:42.005 --> 40:44.741
The people are
so passionate and--

40:44.774 --> 40:46.577
What's wrong with you?

40:46.610 --> 40:48.112
You missed our call
with Mom.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.015
Don't pretend you suddenly care,
because you don't.

40:52.048 --> 40:53.816
Of course, I care.

40:53.850 --> 40:54.952
-Why wouldn't--
-[Tal] And don't worry,

40:54.985 --> 40:56.487
-I lied for you.
-[Janelle] You--

She got three years,
no good behavior.

41:03.226 --> 41:04.962
And it's that long
before she even gets

41:04.995 --> 41:06.630
to go up for parole.

41:06.663 --> 41:08.232
Have you even thought
about what it must be like

41:08.265 --> 41:09.500
-for her in there?
-Of course I thought

41:09.533 --> 41:10.767
about it, Tal.
She's our mother.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.236
How could I
not think about it?

41:12.269 --> 41:14.071
But we need to think
about me and you right now.

taking care of us.

it yourself, okay?

41:19.209 --> 41:20.944
Atlanta has a lot
of good things going

For you.

41:23.747 --> 41:25.182
You know
what it has for me?

41:25.215 --> 41:27.684
It has a shitty school,
it has a wing store,

41:27.717 --> 41:29.219
and it has an uncle
who's keeping me quite literally

41:29.252 --> 41:30.988
-in the fucking closet.
-[Janelle] And what?

41:31.021 --> 41:32.656
I'm not allowed
to be hopeful
even just a little?

41:32.689 --> 41:34.223
Why, because
you're miserable?

41:34.257 --> 41:36.193
Well, you've always
been miserable.

41:38.028 --> 41:39.863
No. No, you're
just not allowed

41:39.896 --> 41:42.199
-to be that damn selfish.
-Excuse me?
