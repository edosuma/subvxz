No way.

Emmett Grant at

00:18.714 --> 00:22.022
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

- Hey, Chris.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.072
So you're babysitting?

00:29.116 --> 00:31.857
- Just till my mom
gets home.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.555
- I'm not a baby.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.078
We're gonna eat meatball
sandwiches and play Xbox.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.688
- We are.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.168
Look, you go get us set
and I'll be up in a minute,

00:38.212 --> 00:39.604
Okay, Em?

00:39.648 --> 00:41.824
- It's not gonna be a minute.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.130
- You always say a minute.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.131
It's never a minute.

00:46.655 --> 00:50.702
Going home to work on algebra,
but I don't really get it.

00:50.746 --> 00:51.834
Do you?

00:51.877 --> 00:54.750

when we heard the call.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.129
What happened?

01:26.173 --> 01:27.435
- Single explosion,
first floor,

01:27.478 --> 01:28.871
right in the corner
of the building.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.655

any kind of shrapnel?

- What time was
the explosion exactly?

01:33.528 --> 01:36.487
- Reports peg it at 4:03.

01:36.531 --> 01:40.012
- It's nine minutes ago.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.710
We need every emergency vehicle
headed here

01:41.753 --> 01:43.277
stopped outside the perimeter.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.626
Evacuate this building.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.285

and get out right now.

01:51.328 --> 01:53.635

- Ma'am, ma'am,
you can't go in, ma'am.

- Let me through!

01:55.767 --> 01:56.855
My boys are in there!

01:56.899 --> 01:58.466
- We have the fire department

01:58.509 --> 01:59.467
that's bringing everyone else
that they can, okay?

01:59.510 --> 02:00.685

02:00.729 --> 02:02.513
- Mom, Mom,
I'm over here!

02:04.036 --> 02:05.603

- Oh, my God. Thank God.

Where's Emmett, baby?

02:09.216 --> 02:13.176

02:13.220 --> 02:14.656
- No, no, no, no, no.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.092
He's right inside,
he's only seven,

02:16.136 --> 02:17.833
and he knows not to open
the door for anyone.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.574
- Okay, okay, just stay with me
for just a minute.

02:19.617 --> 02:21.793
- You don't understand.
He's my baby.

02:21.837 --> 02:24.361
- Listen, I know every instinct
is telling you to go in there,

02:24.405 --> 02:25.362
but you just need to--

02:40.899 --> 02:42.249
- Oh, my leg!

Shut down all subway lines

He was small for his age,

who lived there?

06:31.913 --> 06:33.567
- Felton Ames.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.003
- This is the building's super.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.919
- A scumbag drug dealer.

06:37.962 --> 06:41.444
Been trying to get him
out of the building for a year.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.620
- If he had some rank,
he could have been a target.

06:43.664 --> 06:47.581
- Yeah, he was always parading
around like some big deal:

06:47.624 --> 06:52.150
red silk suits, fools
with guns taking him around.

06:52.194 --> 06:56.807
- We'll check into him.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.347
- A body in the apartment
that took the brunt of this.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.444
- Peek under.

07:24.487 --> 07:31.059
There's a foot and the bottom
of some red suit pants.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.582
- Sounds like it
could be Felton Ames.

07:32.626 --> 07:38.501
- All right, let's get him out,
see what we have.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.589
- Ugh.

07:42.984 --> 07:46.640
- Yeah, looks like it.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.381
It's melted to his leg.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.825
- Two bombs,
and they both went boom,

07:57.868 --> 07:58.826
which means whoever
we're looking for

07:58.869 --> 08:00.175
knows what they're doing.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.524
First lick
of the ice cream cone

08:01.568 --> 08:02.917
always goes
to National Security.

08:02.960 --> 08:05.354

Homeland Security,

08:05.397 --> 08:07.225
nothing on the wires
or in the chatrooms

08:07.269 --> 08:08.662
for the last 72 hours.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.533
And no reaction since.

08:10.577 --> 08:12.361
- Well, if any terrorist group
could claim it, they would

08:12.404 --> 08:14.189
and I like the story we're
building in the field anyway:

08:14.232 --> 08:17.627
someone targeting a Mac Baller
Blood named Felton Ames.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.063
Tony, can NYPD fill them in?

08:19.107 --> 08:21.370
- Felton Arthur Ames,
33 years old,

08:21.413 --> 08:23.677
boatload of priors for
possession and criminal sale.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.374
Moved up the Mac Ballers

08:25.417 --> 08:27.071
when guys above him
went to jail or the morgue.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.030
But undercovers say he had
a rep for being sloppy.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.988
- Luckily, so are
most gang members.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.425
A guard at Riker's found this
kite in a Mac Baller's cell,

08:33.469 --> 08:35.036
so we know Felton
jumped the line,

08:35.079 --> 08:36.951
got the big homie title anyway.

08:36.994 --> 08:38.300
So let's get into him.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.910
As usual, run everything
through me.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.783
Point agents on the street
are Bell and Zidan.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.219
Let's go, people.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.221
You guys all right?

08:46.264 --> 08:47.918
- We need a line cut
to salvage a cell phone.

08:47.962 --> 08:52.183
- I assume it's connected
to Felton Ames?

08:52.227 --> 08:53.837
- How much information
can you pull out of that?

08:53.881 --> 08:57.406
- If the core memory is
in one piece, maybe everything.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.539
We have a process
called chip off,

08:59.582 --> 09:01.236
but with evidence
this damaged,

09:01.279 --> 09:04.456
Bureau likes the lab
at Quantico to do it.

09:04.500 --> 09:05.806
- How good are you
at chip off?

09:05.849 --> 09:07.547
- I taught the guys
at Quantico.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.550
- Then go for it.

09:10.593 --> 09:12.203
What? If we unwind this
before anything else explodes,

09:12.247 --> 09:13.509
who's gonna complain?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.381
- I will.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.079
If our best lead
gets destroyed,

09:18.122 --> 09:19.863
the attorney general is gonna
point at the direct

09:19.907 --> 09:21.212
and the direct
is gonna point at me.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.606
- I understand,

09:23.650 --> 09:25.477
but would you let me tell you
why we should still do this?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.131
- No, you're
no longer undercover

09:27.175 --> 09:30.004
tracking terrorists,
making your own rules, OA.

09:30.047 --> 09:31.527
You're working for me,

09:31.571 --> 09:32.920
and what I want you to do

09:32.963 --> 09:35.662
is understand
how things work here.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.968
If you have a problem, you
shag your ass down the hall,

09:38.012 --> 09:40.971
you knock on the door,
you tell me about it,

09:41.015 --> 09:44.540
and then I'll fix it.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.414
Now do it.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.251
- I can heal the sick,
not raise the dead,

10:00.295 --> 10:02.514
but let's give it a shot.

10:02.558 --> 10:04.560
- How long you think
this is going to take?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
- If you knew
how delicate this was,

10:06.649 --> 10:09.086
you'd be amazed at my speed.

10:18.966 --> 10:22.491
- Um, I want to--
be right back.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.390
- The chip itself
is intact,

10:52.434 --> 10:55.611
but both metallic
connectors are damaged.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.482
- So the DNA off the leg...
- Shh.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.049
- Matches Felton Ames.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.748
Sorry, I figured even Ian
would be done by now.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.098
- Just need to secure
the ball grid array,

11:04.141 --> 11:07.231
and everything on that phone
is right here,

11:07.275 --> 11:10.408
assuming we can still read it.

11:10.452 --> 11:12.019
- If you can turn this
into something useful,

11:12.062 --> 11:14.674
I will buy you
a steak dinner.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.940
- I'll take it.

11:19.983 --> 11:22.203
- Wayne Clinton's number two
in the Mac Baller lineup.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.248
Apparently Felton leapfrogged
him to get to the top,

11:24.292 --> 11:26.076
so we think that Wayne might
have engineered this bombing

11:26.120 --> 11:27.425
in a move to take over.

11:27.469 --> 11:30.211
- He sent a lot of angry texts
to Felton.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.430
- You know street gangs usually
play with guns, not bombs.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.128
This would be a pretty serious
escalation.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.564
- We still have
to put the pieces together,

11:35.607 --> 11:36.957
but there's something here.
- Yeah.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.959
- We already have
a basic profile on Wayne.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.787
Okay, well, let's start

11:40.830 --> 11:43.528
thickening that up and crash
those three known addresses.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.921
Guys, check it out.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.968
We may have a suspect:
Wayne Clinton.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.059
- You're not gonna take
the FDR?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.756
- When we're in Indiana,
you can navigate.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.671
- I've lived here
for three years.

11:57.194 --> 11:58.369
- Look, just because you're
from Manhattan--

11:58.413 --> 11:59.849
- I'm from Queens.
- Okay.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.765
Hey, Jubal,
we're three minutes out.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.202
- Hey, NYPD hit
Wayne's regular hangouts.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.030
They spotted him heading
into a strip club

12:07.074 --> 12:09.250
called Maxie's on 138th Street.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.818
- No, the place is packed.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.036
He's armed.
They're waiting on backup.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.472
- All right.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.952
Change of plans.

12:20.957 --> 12:24.134
- We've got eyes on the door.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.875
- Copy.

12:28.922 --> 12:35.929
♪

12:37.626 --> 12:41.412
- I'm not pushing, but do you
want to talk about it?

12:41.456 --> 12:44.589
- If there was
something to say.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.113
A seven-year-old boy
died today,

12:46.156 --> 12:48.376
and his mother blames me.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.117
It just--

12:50.160 --> 12:51.640

we might have our target.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.251
- No, not yet.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.863
Need to see his face.
Stand by.

13:05.306 --> 13:07.047
- It looks like Wayne.
- That's definitely him.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.526
Go.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.661
Last thing we need tonight
is a car chase.

13:27.415 --> 13:28.372
- Two separate attacks,

13:28.416 --> 13:29.983
27 confirmed casualties,

13:30.026 --> 13:31.898
and we have no reason to
believe that this is over.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.638
With Felton Ames
and Wayne Clinton both hit,

13:33.682 --> 13:35.597
this is looking
less like an inside move

13:35.640 --> 13:38.121
and more like an outside gang
trying to take out Mac Ballers.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.820
- The question is,
who's feeling strong?

13:40.863 --> 13:42.691
- Based on location
and manpower,

13:42.734 --> 13:44.693
we have to look at the other
gangs working the South Bronx:

13:44.736 --> 13:47.870
G Shine, Bloodhound Brims,
and Sex Money Murder.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.567
Kristen, what does intel think?

13:49.611 --> 13:50.873
- All of them talk big games,

13:50.917 --> 13:52.353
but from
an analyst perspective,

13:52.396 --> 13:53.833
when it comes to actually

13:53.876 --> 13:54.921
taking over
another set's business...

13:54.964 --> 13:56.357
- No one's organized enough.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.054
- No one's well-capitalized
enough.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.274
You need a lot of money
to get into the drug game.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.712
Last year, Mac Ballers did
$50 million in heroin alone.

14:03.755 --> 14:05.453
Even if they're stepping
on every kilo hard,

14:05.496 --> 14:07.629
grinding them down,
adding a pound of fentanyl,

14:07.672 --> 14:09.892
that's a million dollars
a month in product costs,

14:09.936 --> 14:11.459
which another set would
have to be able to pay.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.895
- On top of whatever
they're spending

14:12.939 --> 14:14.636
to keep their
regular business going.

14:14.679 --> 14:17.334
Unlikely any of the players
in the Bronx can afford that.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.727
- So who else
is well-capitalized

14:18.770 --> 14:19.902
and interested
in the South Bronx?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.905
- We just found another bomb.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.785
- Guys were in early setting
up for a basketball tournament.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.570
They found it in a duffel bag
under the bleachers.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.920
- Any idea who'd want to bomb
a community rec center?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.922
- I've only been director
here a few months.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.924
I don't know.
No freakin' clue.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.491
I grew up down the street.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.145
I was career Army.
I just got back.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.365
- I prefer Florida.

14:48.409 --> 14:50.585
But my ma's had a diner
here for 40 years.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.108
She won't leave.

14:52.152 --> 14:53.893
She gets robbed all the time.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.503
I was there this morning,

14:55.546 --> 14:57.853
and I go there in the mornings
and after work,

14:57.897 --> 14:59.202
try to keep an eye on her.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.725
- You just broker gang truces
on the side?

15:02.249 --> 15:05.774
- MMG on his bicep
is for Murda Moore Gangsters.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.950
Dymes Are Us over here
doesn't make it very hard.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.431
You got guys from five
different gangs around, Brick.

15:10.474 --> 15:12.172
So what's with the kumbaya
spirit here anyway?

15:12.215 --> 15:14.261
- As long as I'm in charge,

15:14.304 --> 15:16.219
I don't have time
for their crap.

15:16.263 --> 15:19.353
They can get along, or they can
stay the hell out of the gym.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.576
- Six grenades on a chain.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.013
Cell phone trigger.

15:27.056 --> 15:29.972
Whoever did this
knew what they were doing.

15:30.016 --> 15:31.756
- I haven't seen grenades
like these since West Point.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.802
- Used to be.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.717
They got higher-tech
gear now.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.329
But they dumped most of these
old explosives in El Salvador.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.551
- I'll call you back, Ma.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.814
- You got any MS-13 guys
in your band of bangers?

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
I got a hard enough time
with the black gangs.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.994
The closest thing I got
is this Mexican kid.

15:52.038 --> 15:55.780
He works as a handyman
for me.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.131
- Gonna jump in on your chat
with the Mexican handyman.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.960
- No problem, but he's not
Mexican; he's Salvadoran.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.442
- I'm not MS-13.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.009
Do I look like one of those
guys with the face tattoos

16:07.053 --> 16:08.576
and

16:08.619 --> 16:09.969
- No, but then you boys

16:10.012 --> 16:12.145
were realizing
it made our jobs too easy,

16:12.188 --> 16:13.407
so now they look like you,

16:13.450 --> 16:15.017
dress like you,

16:15.061 --> 16:16.627
but still go out and beat
people to death for fun.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.065
- All I do is work,
every day.

16:19.108 --> 16:20.544
- We know.

16:20.588 --> 16:24.635
And you're sending money
back home to Metapán.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.159
Don't worry, we're not looking
to deport you.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.336
We need your help figuring out
how some explosives

16:29.379 --> 16:31.207
got from El Salvador
to New York

16:31.251 --> 16:32.426
into where you work.

16:32.469 --> 16:34.080
- I'm sure it was MS.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.559
That's exactly why I stay
away from those guys.

16:35.603 --> 16:39.650
- I need to see you two
for a minute.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.697
I didn't want to believe MS-13
had finally made their way

16:42.740 --> 16:45.526
into New York City,
but they're here.

16:45.569 --> 16:49.095
This is security footage
from the rec center.

16:53.969 --> 16:56.015
- You can just feel the crap
coming off that kid.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.060
He put a bomb in that gym,
didn't flinch.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.975
- I'll close this.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.153
- Thanks, but he's young
and he's scared.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.285
I know how to handle him.

17:05.328 --> 17:07.374
- Okay.

17:13.162 --> 17:14.729
- Wilmer, at some point,
you and I are going to sit down

17:14.772 --> 17:18.428
and discuss exactly how you got
involved with MS-13:

17:18.472 --> 17:20.865
who jumped you in, what choices
you had, everything.

17:20.909 --> 17:21.953
But not right now.
- I told you that--

17:21.997 --> 17:23.651
- Stop.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.087
We have you on camera.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.437
So take a deep breath

17:27.481 --> 17:30.223
and let go of any hope you have
of talking your way out of this

17:30.266 --> 17:33.269
and tell me who
gave you that bomb.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.881
- I--what the hell
are you drawing?

17:36.925 --> 17:43.410
- I'm almost done.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.586
- If you don't ID the man who
gave you the bomb right now,

17:45.629 --> 17:47.240
I'm gonna walk out of this room

17:47.283 --> 17:49.155
and I'm gonna call the FBI
office in El Salvador

17:49.198 --> 17:51.418
and I'm going to get them to
find your brother in Metapán.

17:51.461 --> 17:54.464
I'll claw back every single
penny you sent him.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.292
Then I'm gonna
take his house away.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.685
I won't stop until
he and your little sisters

17:57.728 --> 17:59.469
have nothing left.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.384
And then after I'm done
with your family,

18:01.428 --> 18:03.125
I'm gonna come down
as hard as I can

18:03.169 --> 18:04.909
on everyone else in your world

18:04.953 --> 18:10.306
until you tell me
what I want to know.

18:10.350 --> 18:13.744
Name, now.

18:16.443 --> 18:17.618
- Bernardo Funes!

18:17.661 --> 18:19.185
- Go, go, go, go.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.577
- This is the FBI!

18:20.621 --> 18:21.926
- Left door, clear!

18:21.970 --> 18:23.232
- Left room, clear!

18:23.276 --> 18:24.407
- Main room, clear!

18:24.451 --> 18:28.324
- All clear!

18:28.368 --> 18:32.241
- In here, back room.

18:32.285 --> 18:35.070
- Ma'am, ma'am, wake up.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.680
What do you want?

18:38.508 --> 18:43.122
- He said he's gonna pay me
when he gets back.

18:43.165 --> 18:47.430
Ugh, he said
they don't like the light.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.171
- Mm.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.400
- A phone seared into human
flesh doesn't bother you,

19:00.443 --> 19:04.012
but you're afraid of--
- Shut up.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.319
- Fresh air
doing you some good?

19:06.362 --> 19:08.321
- Think Wilmer held out
on us?

19:08.364 --> 19:10.453
- I think he told us what he
knew about Bernardo Funes.

19:10.497 --> 19:13.108
Now he's gonna tell us what he
knows about the rest of MS-13,

19:13.152 --> 19:14.501
and we'll go from there.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.416
- You gonna threaten
his family again?

19:16.459 --> 19:19.288
- You gonna threaten to stab
him in the throat again?

19:19.332 --> 19:22.204
That drawing was really good,
by the way.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.510
Really sold it.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.990
- I wasn't
selling anything.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.862
I only showed Wilmer
because he asked.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.781
- Look, if we'd have known
he was in MS-13,

19:33.824 --> 19:35.435
we would have put him
in special housing.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.871
- Don't you check
gang affiliation

19:36.914 --> 19:38.394
before tossing someone
into gen pop?

19:38.438 --> 19:40.788
- Always,
but the kid denied it.

19:45.967 --> 19:50.014
I can't believe
they got to him this quick.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.977
♪

19:56.020 --> 20:00.199
And we still haven't
found the kid's heart.

20:10.948 --> 20:12.689
- There's nothing the FBI does
better than a manhunt,

20:12.733 --> 20:16.040
which is good because Bell
and Zidan's lead is dead

20:16.084 --> 20:18.042
and the MS-13 members
we're bringing in

20:18.086 --> 20:20.915
swear they're not moving
on the black drug gangs

20:20.958 --> 20:23.352
and Bernardo Funes
is still a ghost.

20:23.396 --> 20:26.834
Fortunately, 200 of New York's
finest and our tech gurus

20:26.877 --> 20:29.445
got together to give us a hand,
so here we go.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.273
Bernardo gives Wilmer the bag,

20:31.317 --> 20:33.667
moves north
from the rec center.

20:33.710 --> 20:36.365
He's walking, so he's probably
not going very far.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.541
He's moving like
he's got somewhere to be,

20:38.585 --> 20:40.326
fast, no stops,

20:40.369 --> 20:42.850
until we lose our visual
on 145th Street.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.678
- 145th's not far
from where Bernardo lives.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.288
- But once he realized
his bomb was found,

20:46.332 --> 20:47.550
did he go to ground
in his own neighborhood

20:47.594 --> 20:49.160
or get the hell
out of the city?

20:49.204 --> 20:50.771
- While you're keeping
public transit shut down,

20:50.814 --> 20:51.989
we'll at least have slowed him
getting out.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.904
- Tell the mayor.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.124
He keeps calling every hour
to see when it'll open back up.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.691
- We can call some
counterterror guys in

20:57.734 --> 20:59.475
for extra help if
you think you can spare them.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.042
- Or we go nuclear.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.697
Put out his name, photo,
get the public involved.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.613
- He starts feeling like
everyone he sees is a threat,

21:06.656 --> 21:08.092
that's when bad things happen.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.573
I know.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.140
It's a risk.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.316
- We have his info queued up.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.839
The networks are all waiting.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.630
- Make this prick famous.

21:23.673 --> 21:25.806
- All right, you have whatever
resource you need.

21:25.849 --> 21:28.025
Do not let Bernardo slip.

21:31.072 --> 21:38.079
♪

21:39.559 --> 21:42.779
- All right, here we go.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.740
Tips are coming in.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.311
Green's likely sightings.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.225
- Looks like he's still
in the Bronx.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.749
Close to home
if it's him.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.186
- He didn't have time
to get out.

22:05.411 --> 22:08.805
- This is unit four
heading north on 140th.

22:28.608 --> 22:30.392
- I never saw Emmett Grant,

22:30.436 --> 22:34.527
but I can't get him
out of my head.

22:36.180 --> 22:40.446
- Lot of people made it out of
that building because of you.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.708
That matters.

22:51.848 --> 22:55.809
- OA, that kid is dressed
like Wilmer.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.941
- MS stamps these kids
out of a mold.

22:57.985 --> 22:59.508
Echo three, stay with the bike
for a minute.

22:59.552 --> 23:02.729
- Copy.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.731
- He's got to be going
to see Bernardo.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.215
- There's an abandoned
building on the corner.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.566
- That's got to be it.

23:18.179 --> 23:19.833
Crap, the kid bailed.

23:19.876 --> 23:22.357
- Wait.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.446
OA.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.106
Hey, you think that kid
felt our surveillance?

23:32.149 --> 23:33.455
- Yep.

23:33.499 --> 23:34.848
- Think he's headed
for Bernardo in here?

23:34.891 --> 23:36.589
- Yep.

23:36.632 --> 23:38.939
- You realize if we go through
this door and Bernardo's

23:38.982 --> 23:40.331
not in there, we're gonna be
explaining ourselves

23:40.375 --> 23:42.290
to every lawyer
in the justice department?

23:42.333 --> 23:43.509
- Yep.

23:44.988 --> 23:46.250
- Try not to kill anyone.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.730
- Stop, now!

23:47.774 --> 23:49.297
Drop what you're holding,
get on your knees.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.341
- We need him alive.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.606
- That's his choice.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.085
- Bernardo,
you mess that up,

23:55.129 --> 23:56.217
you're never gonna walk
or talk again.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.523
Is that what
you really want?

24:06.270 --> 24:07.489
- I guarantee,
you take one step forward

24:07.533 --> 24:09.056
and I'll put you down--

24:09.099 --> 24:10.623
- Good God.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.189
- I shot him in the vest.

24:12.233 --> 24:15.497
He's still alive.

24:16.977 --> 24:19.501
- Looks like we got
the two-for-one over here,

24:19.545 --> 24:22.548
the bad guy and the bomb lab.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.082
- We found traces of blood

24:35.125 --> 24:37.737
on the wire clippers
in the bomb lab.

24:37.780 --> 24:40.653
Turns out the blood
isn't yours.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.306
So just like Wilmer
was working for you,

24:42.350 --> 24:44.134
you're working
with someone else,

24:44.178 --> 24:46.833
and that's your lifeline.

24:46.876 --> 24:49.575
- Who made those bombs,
Bernardo?

24:54.405 --> 24:56.799
We're gonna have a hard time
convincing our U.S. attorney

24:56.843 --> 24:59.062
to show you any consideration
the longer you drag this out.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.890
- You can't help me.

25:00.934 --> 25:06.592
There's no prison, no special
unit they won't get to me.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.811
I'm gonna die in prison
no matter what.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.335
I tell you anything,

25:11.379 --> 25:13.555
I'm dead the day I arrive,
like Wilmer.

25:13.599 --> 25:19.953
I don't talk,
you put me away.

25:19.996 --> 25:23.957
I could live inside
another 40 years.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.873
That's still better
than where I came from.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.837
- Yeah, so now we're left with
the blood from the bomb lab.

25:34.881 --> 25:36.230
- And we ran it.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.014
Didn't match any DNA
that we have on file.

25:38.058 --> 25:39.755
- So best evidence we got
and we can't use it?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.061
- No, I didn't say that.

25:41.104 --> 25:43.150
You ever heard of
genomic phenotyping?

25:43.193 --> 25:45.587
The Bureau's doing
amazing work on it.

25:45.631 --> 25:48.721
It's bioinformatic software
that pulls genetic information

25:48.764 --> 25:51.375
from blood samples
to generate a physical profile.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.943
- And gives us what,
a description of someone?

25:53.987 --> 25:55.597
- If you're lucky,
you get a sketch.

25:55.641 --> 25:57.512
- I just got the report back
from the explosives lab.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.601
The phone our bomb-maker
used as a trigger

25:59.645 --> 26:01.081
was a Handsma 2600,

26:01.124 --> 26:02.691
the same kind of phones
you guys found

26:02.735 --> 26:04.345
in Bernardo's hideout.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.825
It's old, cheap technology

26:05.868 --> 26:07.783
sold mostly in Asia
10 to 15 years ago.

26:07.827 --> 26:09.959
- Why would the bomb-maker
want to use that?

26:10.003 --> 26:11.526
- Because batteries
back then

26:11.570 --> 26:12.614
didn't have good temperature
sensors or fail-safes,

26:12.658 --> 26:14.311
so they ignited more easily.

26:14.355 --> 26:15.835
- You got deep on this.
- By the time I'm done,

26:15.878 --> 26:17.401
I'll be able to build
one of these things,

26:17.445 --> 26:19.621
which I knew
we'd seen once before.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.057
You remember
that bombing attempt

26:21.101 --> 26:22.972
at the synagogue
in Riverdale last year?

26:23.016 --> 26:25.496
- Yeah, the device didn't go
off because the TATP was bad.

26:25.540 --> 26:27.542
- Different explosives,
same detonator.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.762
- Before you guys started here,

26:29.805 --> 26:31.807
we got close to tying that
attack to Robert Lawrence.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.940
- Robert Lawrence, why does
that name sound familiar?

26:33.983 --> 26:35.115
- Because you've
seen him on TV.

26:35.158 --> 26:36.638
He's the guy they always put on

26:36.682 --> 26:38.422
when they want the alt-right
to seem legit.

26:38.466 --> 26:40.250
- Yeah, but if you listen
closely to his dog whistles,

26:40.294 --> 26:42.862
the guy's a Nazi.

26:44.820 --> 26:48.607
- Are you familiar
with Godwin's law?

26:48.650 --> 26:50.826
It's the idea
that the end point

26:50.870 --> 26:52.872
of any intellectual debate

26:52.915 --> 26:56.615
is one party calling
the other a Nazi.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.225
I'm not a Nazi.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.314
- You prefer
white nationalist?

27:00.357 --> 27:01.707
- I prefer Americanist.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.317
- Except in your America,

27:03.360 --> 27:05.275
it's okay to blow up Jews,
African Americans?

27:05.319 --> 27:09.236
- I don't believe in violence
as a means to any social end.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.455
Please.

27:11.499 --> 27:13.066
- So what do you believe in,
Mr. Lawrence?

27:13.109 --> 27:14.894
- The Fund
for National Greatness

27:14.937 --> 27:17.418
was founded
to examine public policy

27:17.461 --> 27:19.812
under a single
objective lens:

27:19.855 --> 27:22.510
is it good for our country?

27:22.553 --> 27:24.294
- So you protested the opening
of a synagogue,

27:24.338 --> 27:27.036
then tried to bomb it, because
it was bad for America?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.864
- I told your colleagues
last year,

27:28.908 --> 27:30.387
I don't know about the bomb.

27:30.431 --> 27:32.607
I do know New York
has more synagogues

27:32.651 --> 27:34.522
than any city
outside of Israel.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.786
- They pushed out
a hospice,

27:37.830 --> 27:39.179
and we don't have enough
of those.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.484
- Oh, so what
you're really passionate

27:40.528 --> 27:42.095
about is health care?

27:42.138 --> 27:44.140
- We spend billions of dollars

27:44.184 --> 27:46.360
on these people
in the last year of their life.

27:46.403 --> 27:49.276
75% of that
is in the final few months.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.627
I mean, don't you see
the absurdity in that?

27:52.671 --> 27:54.716
- You must be the most boring
speaker at these hate rallies.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.152
- It's not a joke.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.415
We should put these people
in hospices,

27:58.459 --> 28:00.243
let them die
the way God intended,

28:00.287 --> 28:01.636
and then spend that money--

28:01.680 --> 28:03.725
- Let's go back
to talking about bombings

28:03.769 --> 28:05.945
on synagogues
and minority communities.

28:05.988 --> 28:09.078
- Is our conversation

28:09.122 --> 28:12.168
too difficult for you
to follow, Agent Zidan?

28:15.911 --> 28:19.785
You must be
terribly conflicted.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.438
- We're not here
to discuss politics.

28:21.482 --> 28:24.615
- Or maybe you
and your partner

28:24.659 --> 28:27.575
can't handle
uncomfortable truths.

28:33.624 --> 28:36.279
Don't you have
anything to say?

28:38.891 --> 28:40.327
- Not to you.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.951
- You know, Robert Lawrence
partnering with MS-13 here,

28:55.995 --> 28:57.997
it makes sense.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.260
I mean, MS started
to protect Salvadoran refugees

29:00.303 --> 29:01.478
from black street gangs,

29:01.522 --> 29:03.176
so he taps into that hate.

29:03.219 --> 29:06.135
Right, bombings appeal to their
taste for hyper violence,

29:06.179 --> 29:07.397
makes a way bigger statement

29:07.441 --> 29:08.877
than gunning down
people ever could.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.314
- MS runs a low-dollar
extortion racket.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.707
That brings them
into the drug game.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.796
They start
making real money.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.406
But what's driving
Lawrence here?

29:16.450 --> 29:17.407
- Two things.

29:17.451 --> 29:19.801
First, he needs cash.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.063
That think tank Lawrence runs?

29:21.107 --> 29:22.848
- The Fund
for National Greatness.

29:22.891 --> 29:24.893
- It's underwater.

29:24.937 --> 29:26.677
Isn't that place
the crème de la crme

29:26.721 --> 29:28.331
of the white
supremacist movement?

29:28.375 --> 29:31.465
- It is, but he just took out
three separate bank loans,

29:31.508 --> 29:33.162
each for $5 million.

29:33.206 --> 29:34.729
15 million's
a lot more than he'd need

29:34.773 --> 29:36.818
for expanding programs
and outreach.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.167
- But about right
to cover the buy-in

29:38.211 --> 29:39.560
on the Mac Baller
drug territory.

29:39.603 --> 29:41.867
- Lawrence fronts
that cash to MS-13,

29:41.910 --> 29:43.433
they do the dirty work,

29:43.477 --> 29:45.827
both organizations get massive
inflows of cash.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.917
- Okay, so what's
the second thing

29:48.961 --> 29:50.092
Lawrence gets out of this?

29:50.136 --> 29:52.312
- He starts a race war.

29:52.355 --> 29:55.402
"Mud people" start
blowing each other up.

29:59.362 --> 30:01.451
- This has Lawrence
written all over it.

30:01.495 --> 30:02.931
- He's behind this.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.585
- Well, we got warrants
for his phones,

30:04.628 --> 30:06.195
so we're looking into everyone
he's talked to.

30:06.239 --> 30:07.414
- And I got two dozen agents
in Lawrence's neighborhood

30:07.457 --> 30:08.719
up in Scarsdale,
and we're going

30:08.763 --> 30:10.112
floor to floor
in his office building.

30:10.156 --> 30:11.679
- Hi, I have the results

30:11.722 --> 30:12.898
on the blood you found
in the bomb lab,

30:12.941 --> 30:14.595
but I'm supposed to tell you,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.292
genomic phenotyping
is a developing technology--

30:16.336 --> 30:17.685
- I'm familiar
with the caveats,

30:17.728 --> 30:20.166
but you guys are
getting pretty damn good.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.431
Bomb-maker look like
anyone we know?

30:26.650 --> 30:27.651
- You spent
your time in the army

30:27.695 --> 30:29.305
with the 20th engineer brigade

30:29.349 --> 30:32.047
building roads,
digging trenches.

30:32.091 --> 30:34.615
But you also earned
your Sapper Tab.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.138
OA had to tell me that
that's what they called

30:36.182 --> 30:37.792
the guys that blow things up.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.489
Then a few years later, you crossed paths

30:39.533 --> 30:41.230
with Robert Lawrence in Fort Bragg,

30:41.274 --> 30:43.754
where he did a stint
in the army intel.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.887
- Fortunately,
not in my old unit.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.716
- Yeah, and I would
have mentioned it to you

30:48.759 --> 30:50.152
when we met,
but you're really

30:50.196 --> 30:51.719
not the kind of guy
I want to get a beer with.

30:51.762 --> 30:53.329
- They pay you extra

30:53.373 --> 30:55.766
to drag this affirmative action
baboon around?

30:55.810 --> 30:56.942
- They don't pay
either of us enough

30:56.985 --> 30:58.552
for dealing
with people like you.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.032
The good news is,

31:00.075 --> 31:02.077
we've already got you
for building those bombs.

31:02.121 --> 31:03.905
So as soon as you tell us
everything we want to know

31:03.949 --> 31:06.125
about Lawrence's involvement,

31:06.168 --> 31:08.301
we never have to see
each other again.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.607
- Except maybe in court.

31:10.651 --> 31:11.913
- Right,
but that'll be quick,

31:11.957 --> 31:13.610
just telling the judge
he cooperated.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.830
- Yeah, unless he doesn't.
Then it gets ugly.

31:15.874 --> 31:16.918
- Right.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.138
- I'll tell you everything,

31:19.181 --> 31:22.010
but first you got to drop
all the charges against me.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.490
I can't leave my mother alone

31:23.533 --> 31:24.926
with those animals
in the South Bronx.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.623
- Then maybe she can move

31:26.667 --> 31:28.103
near whatever federal prison
you'll be rotting in.

31:28.147 --> 31:29.626
- I'm serious.

31:29.670 --> 31:30.976
You may think you're serious,

31:31.019 --> 31:33.369
but I can assure you,
you're not.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.980
We're close on Lawrence.

31:35.023 --> 31:39.375
We need you to finish it now.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.942
- We searched Brick's house,

31:40.986 --> 31:42.857
found $10,000 in cash.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.641
- Payment from Lawrence
for building the bombs?

31:44.685 --> 31:46.208
- We can't find any record
of them calling each other,

31:46.252 --> 31:48.036
but at some point,
they must have connected.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.429
Jubal's comparing
their timelines now.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.170
- Okay.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.749
Because swallowing hard
isn't a plan.

32:05.793 --> 32:08.404
- Well, the job doesn't stop,
so I don't.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.276
Eventually, you outrun it.

32:16.195 --> 32:17.500
- Did that work
with your husband?

32:21.243 --> 32:22.941
I'm sorry, it just felt
more disrespectful for me

32:22.984 --> 32:25.987
to pretend I didn't know.

32:26.031 --> 32:31.950
Were you really back to work
a few days after he died?

32:31.993 --> 32:34.213
- Guy drove a truck down
a sidewalk on Halloween.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.215
It was all hands on deck.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.788
- Just saying, if I can help--
- I'll let you know.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.531
- Okay.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.841
- Thank you.

32:59.934 --> 33:03.068
- All right, so Lawrence
commuted back and forth

33:03.111 --> 33:05.635
from Scarsdale to Midtown
every day this week.

33:05.679 --> 33:06.854
So he's in his office...

33:06.897 --> 33:07.942
- And Brick is
in the South Bronx.

33:07.986 --> 33:08.943
- Right.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.597
- Not a lot of holes

33:10.640 --> 33:12.033
where they can get together
to buy tiki torches

33:12.077 --> 33:13.121
let alone plan
a whole bombing spree.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.383
- Doesn't seem like it.

33:14.427 --> 33:18.300
- Except the day
we caught Bernardo.

33:18.344 --> 33:20.302
Lawrence left his office
at 6:06 p.m.,

33:20.346 --> 33:22.435
didn't make it home
till 7:35 p.m.

33:22.478 --> 33:26.091
That drive takes,
what, an hour?

33:26.134 --> 33:27.614
Okay, so maybe
there was some traffic,

33:27.657 --> 33:30.225
but also it gave
enough time for Lawrence

33:30.269 --> 33:33.011
to make a quick detour
through the South Bronx--

33:33.054 --> 33:35.143
Brick's mother's diner.

33:35.187 --> 33:38.277
- I have no idea
who Robert Lawrence is,

33:38.320 --> 33:41.671
and I don't give a flying crap.

33:41.715 --> 33:43.064
What are you three looking at?

33:43.108 --> 33:45.153
Mind your own business
or get out.

33:45.197 --> 33:49.244
- Mrs. Peters--
okay.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.072
- She must make
one hell of a burger.

33:51.116 --> 33:54.249
- Mrs. Peters, we have
a warrant to search your diner.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.034
- Screw your warrant.

33:56.077 --> 33:57.905
- Okay.

33:57.948 --> 33:59.167
Brick didn't have a chance,
did he?

33:59.211 --> 34:01.039
- Nope.

34:03.215 --> 34:05.521
- What are you
doing down there?

34:05.565 --> 34:07.393
Keep your filthy hands
out of my food,

34:07.436 --> 34:10.396
or I'm gonna sue the FBI!

34:21.755 --> 34:22.756
- Maggie, I got something.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.281
- No one would have noticed
this box coming in.

34:28.936 --> 34:30.894
- The grenades.
There's 30 in a box.

34:30.938 --> 34:32.896
We can account for 24
that Brick used so far.

34:32.940 --> 34:35.725
- None.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.295
- Lawrence has one more bomb.

34:50.697 --> 34:56.050
♪

34:56.094 --> 34:57.486
- There's one more bomb.

34:59.358 --> 35:00.837
- No, but Lawrence must.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.012
- Does he really
think he's smart enough

35:02.056 --> 35:03.536
to take out one more target?

35:03.579 --> 35:04.885
- Or he figures he's facing
murder charges anyway

35:04.928 --> 35:05.929
and has nothing to lose.

35:05.973 --> 35:07.496
Where is he?

35:07.540 --> 35:08.628
- CBS studios, he's about
to go on a news show.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.369
You have enough to arrest him?

35:10.412 --> 35:11.979
- Legally, we still need to get there, but I know it's him.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.415
There's no doubt.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.330
- Just try not to take him
down on live TV.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.593
- Got it.

35:24.731 --> 35:29.301
- You know, I've seen
a lot of bad guys in this job:

35:29.344 --> 35:32.130
human traffickers,

35:32.173 --> 35:33.522
serial killers,

35:33.566 --> 35:35.611
pedophiles.

35:35.655 --> 35:38.832
But you know what
they all have in common?

35:38.875 --> 35:40.964
They love their mothers.

35:42.227 --> 35:46.187
- I asked for a glass of water
about an hour and a half ago.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.623
What is wrong with you people?

35:47.667 --> 35:49.277
Is this humane?

35:49.321 --> 35:51.975
- Please don't do this.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.674
- Lawrence had me
give it directly to a runner

35:54.717 --> 35:55.675
after Bernardo was caught.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.243
- He has a list
of the housing projects

35:58.286 --> 36:00.158
the big drug gangs
run in the Bronx.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.202
But I don't think
he's bringing down

36:01.246 --> 36:02.421
the whole building this time.

36:02.464 --> 36:04.684
The last bomb
is packed with nails.

36:04.727 --> 36:08.209
- So he's going after
a crowd of people somewhere.

36:08.253 --> 36:09.558
What else did you
and Lawrence talk about?

36:09.602 --> 36:11.734
- The only other thing
I told him:

36:11.778 --> 36:13.214
the cell phone batteries
are cheap.

36:13.258 --> 36:14.737
They die fast.

36:14.781 --> 36:16.217
They only have enough power
to work as a trigger

36:16.261 --> 36:18.001
for about 24 hours.

36:18.045 --> 36:21.744
- And you gave him that bomb
this time yesterday?

36:24.791 --> 36:27.750
Last bomb
is going off any minute.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.448
- Lawrence must have timed it
to blow while he's on TV.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.058
Good alibi.

36:31.101 --> 36:33.843
- It is designed to kill
as many people as possible.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
- Not yet.

36:37.238 --> 36:41.024
- Quiet, guys.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.201
- Am I dismayed
by the bombings? Of course.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.941
Am I surprised by them? No.

36:44.985 --> 36:47.727
- So black people are getting blown up

36:47.770 --> 36:49.685
and you're not surprised?

36:49.729 --> 36:51.470
- The violence
in that community

36:51.513 --> 36:53.733
is a symptom
of a larger dysfunction

36:53.776 --> 36:55.213
that no one
wants to address.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.127
- Yes, but
is that really true?

36:57.171 --> 36:58.825
People in
the community of Mott Haven

36:58.868 --> 37:01.219
are out in the streets
pleading for change.

37:03.743 --> 37:06.049
- Could be targeting them.

37:06.093 --> 37:07.834
- All right,
let's get out there, people.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.444
- Prayer service happening

37:09.488 --> 37:10.445
at the site
of the apartment bombing.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.186
- He could attack there too.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.667
- Yeah, he could do
the same thing there.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.017
- That would indicate
a community engaged, Andrea?

37:17.060 --> 37:19.585
- It does, it does.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.108
- Maggie, hi.

37:21.151 --> 37:23.110
- Hey, I think Lawrence
is gonna hit the summit.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.329
- It was planned yesterday.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.721
It's indoors.

37:25.765 --> 37:26.722
It's filled
with minority leaders.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.768
- Kristen is speaking there.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.422
- Okay, we'll deal
with Lawrence.

37:30.465 --> 37:33.512
Come on, we got
to play this guy.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.691
- Jubal, I can't
really talk right now.

37:38.734 --> 37:40.519
- The bomb is there!
Clear the hall!

37:40.562 --> 37:43.043
- I can try, but I--

37:43.086 --> 37:45.480
- No, it's that
or find the bomb, Kristen.

37:45.524 --> 37:48.004

37:53.358 --> 37:56.883

37:59.320 --> 38:00.887
prayer vigils, demonstrations,

38:00.930 --> 38:02.889
are these effective measures
towards solutions?

38:02.932 --> 38:06.240
- You know, we can only hope
to help these people

38:06.284 --> 38:09.765
if we're willing to be honest
about root causes.

38:09.809 --> 38:13.247
- That's just code
for racist victim-blaming.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.989
Systemic, institutionalized
racism is the real--

38:16.032 --> 38:17.947

to cut you off right here.

38:17.991 --> 38:20.515
We're gonna go now live
to that summit in the Bronx

38:20.559 --> 38:22.343

that building.

excuse me, ma'am.

- Bomb!

38:59.641 --> 39:01.904

are you accusing me of?

39:01.948 --> 39:03.210
- Conspiracy
to commit murder.

39:03.253 --> 39:04.907
Conspiracy
to commit a hate crime.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.692

you have no proof

39:06.735 --> 39:08.433
that I actually did anything.

39:08.476 --> 39:10.086

39:10.130 --> 39:12.350
you're the one that can't
handle uncomfortable truths.

to call my lawyer.

39:38.854 --> 39:41.901

Can I reach in and get it

pathetic part about this

40:38.000 --> 40:40.742
wasn't you thinking you
outsmarted us.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.091

nothing.
