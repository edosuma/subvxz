WEBVTT

00:01.024 --> 00:02.424
What about "breasts"?
Try "breasts."

00:02.555 --> 00:04.621
Nah, then you just get
skeevy medical pictures.

00:05.146 --> 00:07.186
Try "bikini malfunctions."

00:07.682 --> 00:08.981
Ugh!

00:09.016 --> 00:10.549
Blocked. Again.

00:10.585 --> 00:13.018
My parents block everything!

00:13.054 --> 00:15.254
You live in the one house in
the world that can't get porn.

00:15.289 --> 00:16.922
Wait, I heard that Liz Stephens

00:16.958 --> 00:18.557
and her friends go
to Seneca Park,

00:18.593 --> 00:20.059
you know, by
the river.

00:20.094 --> 00:21.627
And they go topless.

00:21.662 --> 00:24.396
Let's satellite view it.

00:24.432 --> 00:26.565
Oh, my God. There!

00:26.601 --> 00:28.000
Boobs!

00:28.035 --> 00:30.636
Dude, no way you can see
boobs from that far away.

00:30.671 --> 00:31.871
Then zoom in, idiot!

00:31.906 --> 00:33.639
Make 'em big.

00:33.674 --> 00:35.441
If that's Liz Stephens,
I'm totally Instagramming it.

00:35.476 --> 00:36.642
Shut up and zoom.

00:37.745 --> 00:39.245
Oh, my God!
Holy crap!

00:39.280 --> 00:41.714
This is even cooler
than boobs.

00:41.749 --> 00:43.516
Definitely.

00:49.190 --> 00:51.657
Come on, Christine,
if you want to be a big girl,

00:51.692 --> 00:53.859
you got to eat your breakfast.
It's good for you.

00:53.895 --> 00:58.397
Mommy says size is determined
genetically.

01:00.201 --> 01:01.600
Any ideas?

01:01.636 --> 01:03.002
Yes, there's a Chinese
immersion kindergarten

01:03.037 --> 01:04.637
that we should
definitely visit.

01:04.672 --> 01:06.505
No, I'm talking about eating
breakfast here for her.

01:06.541 --> 01:08.574
Not... Forget about the schools
right now. She's not eating.

01:08.609 --> 01:10.509
Yeah.

01:10.545 --> 01:13.946
Without the Vitamins D, C
and E in the food,

01:13.981 --> 01:15.948
you could suffer
from asthma, anemia,

01:15.983 --> 01:18.918
truncal and limb ataxia,
sweetheart.

01:18.953 --> 01:21.754
That's not gonna work,
Bones. You don't...

01:24.158 --> 01:25.291
Look at that.

01:25.326 --> 01:26.792
How'd you do that?

01:26.827 --> 01:29.695
There are 113 kindergartens
in the area, Booth.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.764
Choosing the right one for
Christine is a critical choice.

01:31.799 --> 01:33.432
We don't have to worry
about that right now.

01:33.467 --> 01:34.567
We've got
a lot of time.

01:34.602 --> 01:35.935
Okay, worst-case scenario--

01:35.970 --> 01:37.736
we can always go
to Brandon Elementary,

01:37.772 --> 01:39.204
right down the street.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.407
Their student-to-teacher
ratio is 14 to one, Booth.

01:41.442 --> 01:42.875
That's way too high.

01:42.910 --> 01:47.413
Wow. Mom is getting
really serious with this.

01:47.448 --> 01:49.014
Christine deserves
a clearly structured program

01:49.050 --> 01:51.050
that will stimulate
her intellectual growth.

01:51.085 --> 01:52.751
Right, but she also
needs a program

01:52.787 --> 01:54.086
that encourages kids, you know,

01:54.121 --> 01:55.454
to skin their knees every
once in a while,

01:55.489 --> 01:56.789
or draw pictures

01:56.824 --> 01:58.624
that they could put up
on the refrigerator...

01:58.659 --> 01:59.725
Brennan. Oh, okay.

01:59.760 --> 02:00.926
Got to help me out here.

02:00.962 --> 02:01.927
Okay, I'll be right there.

02:01.963 --> 02:02.928
A body arrived at the lab.

02:02.964 --> 02:04.330
All right,
I-I got this one.

02:04.365 --> 02:05.764
Don't worry.
Maybe we should ask Christine

02:05.800 --> 02:06.999
what she would like.
Go ahead.

02:07.034 --> 02:10.735
I want to learn to be Chinese.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.338
Well, um... okay.

02:12.373 --> 02:14.907
You know,
I-I'll let you handle that.

02:14.942 --> 02:16.308
We'll discuss it later.
I love you both.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.209
I love you.

02:17.244 --> 02:19.845
Love you.
Mwah.

02:19.880 --> 02:20.779
Right.

02:20.815 --> 02:22.281
Daddy.
Yeah.

02:22.316 --> 02:23.549
If I'm Chinese,

02:23.584 --> 02:26.151
will I still be able
to skin my knees?

02:26.187 --> 02:27.820
Definitely be able
to skin your knees.

02:27.855 --> 02:29.822
- Don't worry about it.
- Promise!

02:29.857 --> 02:32.491
The victim has
a narrow sciatic notch

02:32.526 --> 02:35.527
and partially defined lower
extremities on the pubic face.

02:35.563 --> 02:37.663
A white male
in his 20s.

02:37.698 --> 02:38.864
That's what I said.

02:38.899 --> 02:40.466
This was totally
a revenge killing.

02:40.501 --> 02:41.800
Based on...?

02:41.836 --> 02:43.135
The old gutsky.

02:43.170 --> 02:45.437
Ms. Warren, in this lab
we make conclusions

02:45.473 --> 02:47.172
based on facts,
not intuition.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.408
I had a gut feeling
you'd say that.

02:49.443 --> 02:51.710
Based on blowfly
larvae, the body was

02:51.746 --> 02:53.779
on the riverbank
for two and a half days.

02:53.814 --> 02:55.714
Well, comparing the remains
to this satellite image

02:55.750 --> 02:57.383
that was taken two days ago,

02:57.418 --> 02:59.284
the degree of marbling
in the abdomen

02:59.320 --> 03:01.487
puts time of death
about six days ago.

03:01.522 --> 03:03.622
Basic math dictates
the victim was in the river

03:03.658 --> 03:05.624
for three and a half days.

03:09.764 --> 03:12.498
Is our work interfering with
your social life, Ms. Warren?

03:12.533 --> 03:14.967
Mm. No. Not at all.

03:15.002 --> 03:18.237
Who would cut out somebody's
eyes, nose, lips and ears?

03:18.272 --> 03:19.657
A <i> Chelydra serpentina.</i>

03:19.681 --> 03:21.007
It's no psycho killer,

03:21.008 --> 03:23.809
it's just an eastern snapping
turtle having a little snack.

03:23.844 --> 03:26.145
Ms. Warren.
I second that.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.347
Sorry, sorry. There's
total drama at the house.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.102
All the people I live with
are freaking out.

03:30.117 --> 03:32.217
<i>All</i> the people?

03:32.253 --> 03:33.786
Yeah, there's like 19 of us now.

03:33.821 --> 03:35.187
19?
Yeah.

03:35.222 --> 03:37.523
There were a lot more
while I was growing up.

03:37.558 --> 03:39.425
Oh, I have so many questions.

03:39.460 --> 03:41.894
As have I. About the remains.

03:41.929 --> 03:43.796
Yeah, I am on it. Totally.

03:45.199 --> 03:47.566
The ligaments have
irregular, frayed ends

03:47.601 --> 03:48.834
consistent with tearing.

03:48.869 --> 03:50.803
She's right, the
arms were torn off.

03:50.838 --> 03:52.337
Well, don't blame
the turtle for that.

03:52.373 --> 03:53.572
Booth should know about this.

03:53.607 --> 03:54.707
Hey.

03:54.742 --> 03:56.075
So, you grew up in a commune?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.209
God, no.

03:57.244 --> 03:58.610
An educational cooperative.

03:58.646 --> 04:00.679
There were 37 of us
including parents.

04:00.715 --> 04:02.581
Okay, now I just have
more questions.

04:02.616 --> 04:03.782
An educa...

04:03.818 --> 04:04.917
Hey, Bones.

04:04.952 --> 04:06.652
This is not an accident victim.

04:06.687 --> 04:08.754
The irregular, frayed ligaments

04:08.789 --> 04:11.523
in both shoulder joints indicate
the arms were torn off.

04:11.559 --> 04:13.559
You know, it's probably
gang-related.

04:13.594 --> 04:15.327
Gangs think it's smart
to weigh down their bodies

04:15.362 --> 04:17.863
by their arms or legs before
dumping them in the water.

04:17.898 --> 04:21.266
Victim also has perimortem
fracturing related to a beating.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.068
Wait a second,
a beating before dumping?

04:23.104 --> 04:25.237
You know what, there's a good
chance this murder was payback.

04:25.272 --> 04:26.272
That's what I said.

04:26.273 --> 04:28.474
Well, I said "revenge killing,"

04:28.509 --> 04:29.808
but same difference.

04:29.844 --> 04:31.276
It was a gut call.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.277
Yeah, that's nice, though.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.779
I like the gut call.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.047
That's not allowed here.

04:35.082 --> 04:36.381
That is correct.

04:36.417 --> 04:38.884
Using your gut
in the field is one thing,

04:38.919 --> 04:41.386
but there is absolutely no room
for guts in my lab.

04:41.422 --> 04:44.723
Then... what do I, uh...
do with these?

05:21.227 --> 05:24.373
Body washed up here,
near Old Sugarland Run.

05:24.374 --> 05:26.007
Any gang-related activity
nearby?

05:26.084 --> 05:28.351
Downstream about 15 miles.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.821
All right. Look, they wouldn't
drive that far upstream

05:30.821 --> 05:32.153
to dump a body.

05:32.189 --> 05:33.922
So, any I.D. yet?

05:33.957 --> 05:36.024
No, and I don't know
how there ever will be

05:36.059 --> 05:37.659
with the remains
they have to work with.

05:37.694 --> 05:40.795
Never, ever underestimate
a squint, okay?

05:40.831 --> 05:42.430
I've seen them
solve a crime

05:42.466 --> 05:44.332
with two fingers
and a bottle cap.

05:44.368 --> 05:45.533
And I thought I was smart.

05:45.569 --> 05:47.635
I mean, I am,
but not that way.

05:47.671 --> 05:50.438
Dr. Hodgins said the
clothing scraps were made up

05:50.474 --> 05:54.009
of, uh, worn jeans,
T-shirts, all low-rent stuff.

05:54.044 --> 05:55.777
All right.

05:55.812 --> 05:56.978
Aubrey, what do you remember

05:57.014 --> 05:58.446
about your kindergarten
experience?

05:58.482 --> 05:59.848
Whoa, wow.

05:59.883 --> 06:01.249
You really don't trust me

06:01.284 --> 06:04.119
if my background check's
going back that far.

06:04.154 --> 06:06.388
Bones is... she's talking
about, uh, schools,

06:06.423 --> 06:07.856
you know, for Christine.

06:07.891 --> 06:10.125
Oh...

06:10.160 --> 06:12.794
Okay. So, fighting, are we?

06:12.829 --> 06:15.597
Excuse me?

06:15.632 --> 06:17.665
Isn't, uh, education
one of the big subjects,

06:17.701 --> 06:20.201
up there with, uh,
sex and money?

06:20.237 --> 06:21.237
We're discussing.

06:21.271 --> 06:22.837
<i>Discussing.</i>
Right.

06:22.873 --> 06:25.206
Just forget it. Just forget it.

06:25.242 --> 06:27.675
Look, everyone's too precious
about school nowadays.

06:27.711 --> 06:30.412
They call coloring
a small motor skill.

06:30.447 --> 06:32.447
To me, if you're interested in
something, you get smart at it.

06:32.482 --> 06:33.682
Yeah, exactly. Like this case.

06:33.717 --> 06:35.016
Which we know nothing about.

06:35.052 --> 06:37.185
And we will work
until we get answers, right?

06:39.623 --> 06:41.790
The exit wound
on the squamous region

06:41.825 --> 06:44.659
of the right temporal bone
measures 8.5 centimeters.

06:44.694 --> 06:48.830
The victim also suffered
fractures to the L-3 and L-4.

06:48.865 --> 06:51.733
Okay, it's gonna be
tough to I.D.

06:51.768 --> 06:54.369
without eyes, ears,
lips or a nose,

06:54.404 --> 06:56.004
but I'll give it a shot.

06:56.039 --> 06:58.239
Hey, so 19 of you actually
lived in the same house?

06:58.275 --> 06:59.808
Yeah. Oh, wait-- no.

06:59.843 --> 07:01.576
Sam just left for Juilliard,
so there's 18.

07:01.611 --> 07:02.777
Not work-related,
I know.

07:02.813 --> 07:04.479
I'll zip it.

07:04.514 --> 07:06.381
You said it was
an educational cooperative.

07:06.416 --> 07:08.316
The only one I'm aware of
in this area

07:08.351 --> 07:10.552
was run by a professor
from Stanford who...

07:10.587 --> 07:12.454
Yeah. Barrett.

07:12.489 --> 07:13.788
Barrett McLaughlin.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.590
You've heard about him?

07:15.625 --> 07:18.126
Yes, I'm surprised that someone
with your academic acumen

07:18.161 --> 07:19.828
was involved
with his experiment.

07:19.863 --> 07:21.029
Well, I'm like the <i> least</i>
accomplished person

07:21.064 --> 07:22.831
in Barrett's cooperative.

07:22.866 --> 07:26.401
There's blue discoloration on
the victim's central incisors.

07:26.436 --> 07:28.169
That could indicate lead
or mercury.

07:28.205 --> 07:30.105
Well, depending on the amount
of toxins,

07:30.140 --> 07:31.806
the victim may have
been poisoned.

07:31.842 --> 07:34.142
All right. Well, I'll take
a sample for the Mass Spec.

07:34.177 --> 07:37.112
But McLaughlin's disregard
for rigorous teaching models

07:37.147 --> 07:39.314
would belie academic
accomplishments.

07:39.349 --> 07:41.883
To a rigid traditionalist, sure.

07:41.918 --> 07:44.652
But we have a Pulitzer Prize
winner, a concert cellist,

07:44.688 --> 07:46.454
and two Rhodes scholars.

07:46.490 --> 07:48.056
So, what's the problem
with the commune?

07:48.091 --> 07:50.358
Cooperative.
Barrett's leaving.

07:50.393 --> 07:53.228
And everyone knows that that
means the experiment is over.

07:53.263 --> 07:54.696
I was born there.

07:54.731 --> 07:56.264
Mm... that's sad.
Perhaps it's for the best.

07:56.299 --> 07:58.666
His experiment was
probably anomalous.

08:00.303 --> 08:03.738
I think you could have used
a little time with us.

08:03.773 --> 08:06.307
I... think I know what
the victim's last meal was.

08:06.343 --> 08:07.442
Chinese food.

08:07.477 --> 08:10.111
Two Rhodes scholars?

08:10.147 --> 08:11.279
Yeah.

08:11.314 --> 08:13.014
Huh.

08:13.049 --> 08:15.116
Hey, how's it coming?

08:15.152 --> 08:17.452
You're just in time
for us to put back

08:17.487 --> 08:19.420
what the turtles snapped away.

08:19.456 --> 08:21.256
So, this is an estimate,

08:21.291 --> 08:23.825
but it's close enough to grab
any matches that come up.

08:23.860 --> 08:25.660
I found out what happened
to Jessica's professor.

08:25.695 --> 08:26.628
Oh, yeah?

08:26.663 --> 08:27.595
Yeah.

08:27.631 --> 08:29.464
He checked into
a retirement home.

08:29.499 --> 08:30.665
Oh, wow.

08:30.700 --> 08:32.332
Out of one commune
and into another.

08:32.369 --> 08:33.369
Ironic.

08:33.370 --> 08:35.770
Well, actually it's consistent.

08:35.804 --> 08:38.173
But it must have been really fun
growing up like that.

08:38.207 --> 08:39.541
Come on. That's
not so different

08:39.576 --> 08:41.109
than how you grew up, right?

08:41.144 --> 08:43.278
Being on the road with your dad
and the rest of the band.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.946
I mean, it beats me,

08:44.981 --> 08:47.248
dressing up in a little suit
and tie for school.

08:47.284 --> 08:50.051
So, I guess no private school
for Michael Vincent?

08:50.086 --> 08:51.286
No.

08:51.321 --> 08:53.521
No, public school is
perfectly fine.

08:53.557 --> 08:55.637
Especially since that's
the only thing we can afford.

08:55.659 --> 08:56.858
Yeah, there's that.

08:56.893 --> 08:58.059
Yeah.

09:01.398 --> 09:02.897
Oh.

09:02.933 --> 09:06.034
Oh, let's see what
Missing Persons came up with.

09:10.040 --> 09:11.906
Oh, man.

09:11.942 --> 09:13.041
You know him?

09:13.076 --> 09:14.409
It's Hayes Robertson.

09:14.444 --> 09:16.945
He's a-- he's a gazillionaire
video game designer.

09:16.980 --> 09:19.781
Okay, then why is he wearing
such crappy clothes?

09:19.816 --> 09:20.848
Well, he's a gamer.

09:20.884 --> 09:23.685
It's couch
potato chic.

09:25.088 --> 09:26.088
He had a roommate?

09:26.122 --> 09:27.589
I thought he was wealthy.

09:27.624 --> 09:29.457
Well, you know,
he was a geek, okay?

09:29.492 --> 09:32.126
Money doesn't, uh, mean
the same thing to <i> them.</i>

09:32.162 --> 09:35.263
Okay.

09:35.298 --> 09:37.432
If he was killed here,
they would've cleaned up.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.935
Does it look like they clean,
Bones? I don't think so.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.237
Noah Gummersall.
FBI.

09:42.272 --> 09:43.838
Anyone home?
Door was open.

09:43.873 --> 09:46.174
Booth,
someone's coming.

09:48.678 --> 09:50.211
Are you kidding me?

09:50.247 --> 09:51.579
How can I help you?

09:51.615 --> 09:53.047
Stop. Right there, okay?

09:53.083 --> 09:54.816
FBI, Agent Booth.

09:54.851 --> 09:57.418
Looking for, uh,
Noah Gummersall.

09:57.454 --> 09:58.953
I'm Noah Gummersall.

09:58.989 --> 10:00.509
Is there a human
entity we can talk to?

10:00.523 --> 10:04.158
Well, I'm in my office,
but this should do.

10:04.194 --> 10:05.526
No, it won't do, okay?

10:05.562 --> 10:07.161
We need to ask you
a few questions

10:07.197 --> 10:08.463
about your roommate
who was murdered.

10:08.498 --> 10:10.898
Oh, my God.

10:10.934 --> 10:12.200
He's... Yeah.

10:12.235 --> 10:13.268
Follow me.

10:13.303 --> 10:14.469
Follow you.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.711
Ah, there he is, Mr. Robot-man.

10:23.747 --> 10:24.979
You go right here.

10:28.418 --> 10:30.418
You sure it was Hayes?
I mean, I just saw him.

10:30.453 --> 10:32.787
Oh, really? Because, you know,
he's been dead for days.

10:32.822 --> 10:34.555
Well, I just-just meant
sometimes I wouldn't

10:34.591 --> 10:36.357
see him for a week
at a time, but...

10:36.393 --> 10:38.126
So the night he was killed.
Tuesday?

10:38.161 --> 10:40.128
Tuesday. I saw him Tuesday.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.496
We-we ordered takeout.

10:41.531 --> 10:42.897
You had Chinese food.

10:42.932 --> 10:45.066
Lo mein noodles,
kung pao chicken.

10:45.101 --> 10:46.768
Yeah, how'd you know?

10:48.672 --> 10:50.004
What are you doing?

10:50.040 --> 10:51.773
It's Chloe.

10:51.808 --> 10:53.408
My girlfriend.

10:53.443 --> 10:55.276
I have to tell her the news.

10:55.312 --> 10:57.478
She's gonna be crushed.
Why don't you just focus right now,

10:57.514 --> 10:59.013
and put that down,
because you are

10:59.049 --> 11:00.748
a potential suspect
in a murder investigation.

11:00.784 --> 11:02.317
Me?

11:02.352 --> 11:04.919
Hayes and I have been
best friends since kindergarten.

11:04.954 --> 11:08.623
Uh, and where did you
attend kindergarten, Mr....

11:08.658 --> 11:09.791
Bones, really?
That's not the time.

11:09.826 --> 11:12.160
Tuesday night,
where were you?

11:12.195 --> 11:15.296
Here. I'm-I'm always here.

11:15.332 --> 11:17.732
I left here two times
in the past three months.

11:17.767 --> 11:19.734
What are you doing?
Checking for blood

11:19.769 --> 11:21.302
and bone fragments.

11:21.338 --> 11:23.638
Are you allowed to do it?
Is she allowed to do that?

11:23.673 --> 11:24.772
I'm sorry, do you work?
Sure I do.

11:24.808 --> 11:26.708
I-I test video games

11:26.743 --> 11:28.109
for Hayes.

11:28.144 --> 11:31.779
You and Hayes had
a joint checking account?

11:31.815 --> 11:33.514
Uh, well,
that was sort of

11:33.550 --> 11:35.583
how I got paid,
and I'm pretty sure

11:35.618 --> 11:37.385
you're not allowed to just go
through my things.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.320
So you basically
just write a check

11:39.356 --> 11:42.123
from a rich person's account
whenever you want.

11:42.158 --> 11:43.725
You make that sound bad.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.393
Well, it is bad,

11:45.428 --> 11:47.028
because that rich person
is dead,

11:47.063 --> 11:50.298
and you get all the money.

11:58.639 --> 12:00.639
Oh, my God.

12:00.674 --> 12:01.674
The Heater!

12:01.708 --> 12:03.341
The Heater?
From the game.

12:03.377 --> 12:04.576
It's a weapon that can only

12:04.611 --> 12:07.245
be operated
by those pure of heart.

12:07.281 --> 12:08.441
Okay, Aubrey, don't geek out.

12:08.448 --> 12:10.148
You're here as an agent,
all right?

12:10.183 --> 12:11.683
No, I'm just saying
it's an awesome game, you know?

12:11.718 --> 12:13.084
Hayes Robertson was a g...

12:13.120 --> 12:16.888
Oh, dude,
Kro-no the snow giant!

12:16.924 --> 12:19.624
Are you kidding me?

12:19.660 --> 12:22.093
Really? Okay, what, do I have
to give you quarters now

12:22.129 --> 12:24.329
so you can play
the arcade games?

12:24.364 --> 12:25.797
Come on, you'd be just
as excited

12:25.832 --> 12:27.699
if we were at a...
What are you into?

12:27.734 --> 12:29.034
Gardening?
I'm into

12:29.069 --> 12:30.368
solving a murder.

12:30.404 --> 12:31.903
Good point.
Can we just focus?

12:31.939 --> 12:33.638
I'm Anne Schamberg. You asked
to speak to me about Hayes?

12:33.674 --> 12:34.940
Yeah, FBI Special Agent Booth.

12:34.975 --> 12:36.508
This here is...
Special Agent Aubrey.

12:36.543 --> 12:38.843
Hayes was a friend.
Whatever I can do.

12:38.879 --> 12:40.612
So, Hayes Robertson, what was
your relationship with him?

12:40.647 --> 12:42.614
I was the number two programmer
under Hayes.

12:42.649 --> 12:44.549
We worked side-by-side
developing games.

12:44.585 --> 12:45.917
Sometimes 24/7.

12:45.953 --> 12:47.252
Now that he's dead,

12:47.287 --> 12:49.154
does that make you
number one programmer?

12:49.189 --> 12:51.690
Acting head programmer, yes.

12:51.725 --> 12:53.692
What about his friend
there, uh, Noah?

12:53.727 --> 12:55.860
He started out as a programmer.
Noah and I actually dated

12:55.896 --> 12:57.829
when Immersion Games started up,

12:57.864 --> 13:00.565
and trust me, he's harmless.

13:00.601 --> 13:02.500
Can we walk and talk?

13:02.536 --> 13:04.736
I got to be on the gaming stage,
and I can't be late.

13:04.771 --> 13:06.104
Wait, we-we can see
the actual stage

13:06.139 --> 13:07.539
where the games are shot?

13:07.574 --> 13:08.607
Mm-hmm.

13:08.642 --> 13:10.141
Yes. Yeah.
A-Aubrey.

13:10.177 --> 13:12.777
That could be very important
for the case.

13:12.813 --> 13:14.913
The case.

13:17.050 --> 13:18.450
I found a ring fracture

13:18.485 --> 13:19.784
at the base of the skull.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.353
The skull must have
struck something

13:21.388 --> 13:23.922
with sufficient impact
to snap back into the C1,

13:23.957 --> 13:25.657
causing the ring fracture.

13:25.692 --> 13:28.460
I've seen fractures
on the remains

13:28.495 --> 13:30.295
of suicide victims

13:30.330 --> 13:32.897
who have leapt
from cliffs or bridges.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.667
So it's caused when the skull
makes impact with the water.

13:35.702 --> 13:37.002
Yes.

13:37.037 --> 13:38.903
The exit wound wasn't
an exit wound.

13:38.939 --> 13:40.905
It started
as a depression fracture

13:40.941 --> 13:42.774
caused by blunt force trauma
of some kind.

13:42.809 --> 13:44.342
And when the body was dumped,

13:44.378 --> 13:46.411
the face-first impact
into the river

13:46.446 --> 13:48.813
pushed water through the oral
and nasal cavities

13:48.849 --> 13:50.815
with enough pressure to cause
the depression fracture

13:50.851 --> 13:52.450
to explode outward.

13:52.486 --> 13:54.886
We still don't have
cause of death.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.955
Right, but at least we know
that the body was dropped

13:56.990 --> 13:58.823
into the river from a great
height. So, if we can figure out

13:58.859 --> 14:00.692
the height from which
the body was dropped...

14:00.727 --> 14:03.128
We can find out from <i> where</i>
the body was dropped.

14:03.163 --> 14:05.196
And hopefully retrieve
the victim's arms,

14:05.232 --> 14:06.965
which are likely still submerged
at the drop site.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.335
This was a beautiful
cooperative moment.

14:10.370 --> 14:12.671
Did you feel it?

14:12.706 --> 14:15.340
Hmm.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:25.152 --> 14:27.519
This is where our actors
play out the game scenarios

14:27.554 --> 14:28.987
in motion-capture suits.

14:29.022 --> 14:30.288
The graphics artists
then turn them

14:30.323 --> 14:32.123
into creatures and characters.

14:32.159 --> 14:34.854
This is the coolest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

14:34.878 --> 14:35.728
Aubrey.

14:35.729 --> 14:38.997
But it does not compare with
my daily service to my country.

14:39.032 --> 14:40.799
Look, did Hayes have
any enemies?

14:40.834 --> 14:42.534
Jen and Hayes got into it
sometimes.

14:42.569 --> 14:44.569
Jen as in Jen Park, your CFO?

14:44.604 --> 14:47.372
Sounds like the frustrated CFO
butts heads

14:47.407 --> 14:49.040
with her control
freak game creator.

14:49.076 --> 14:51.276
Was there any arguments last
week? Anything like that?

14:51.311 --> 14:53.244
I guess they kind of
got into it over one

14:53.280 --> 14:56.281
of our new games,<i> The Crusher.</i>
Hayes wouldn't even show her.

14:56.316 --> 14:58.049
<i>The Crusher</i> already had a
release date, though, didn't it?

14:58.085 --> 14:59.350
I had an order in.

14:59.386 --> 15:01.186
Lots of people did.

15:01.221 --> 15:02.721
A delay would be...

15:02.756 --> 15:04.322
costly, I guess,
is the right word.

15:04.357 --> 15:06.124
How costly?

15:06.159 --> 15:08.393
$20 million or so.
Wow. Okay then.

15:08.428 --> 15:09.961
With Hayes out of the picture,
Jen can come in

15:09.996 --> 15:11.162
and just get that
game released on time.

15:11.198 --> 15:12.230
You were late.

15:12.265 --> 15:14.566
I was here ten minutes ago.

15:14.601 --> 15:16.301
Are you bringing
friends in here?

15:16.336 --> 15:18.069
Would you like to keep
your job, Schamberg?

15:18.105 --> 15:20.271
Okay, slow down. FBI. We have
a few questions for you

15:20.307 --> 15:21.940
about the murder
of Hayes Robertson.

15:29.416 --> 15:30.715
My attorney's number.

15:30.751 --> 15:32.584
And since there is
proprietary information

15:32.619 --> 15:34.819
on this stage and since we, uh,

15:34.855 --> 15:37.455
clearly don't trust each other,

15:37.491 --> 15:39.224
I'd like you to leave.

15:39.259 --> 15:40.725
Now.

15:40.761 --> 15:41.926
Aubrey, let's go.

15:43.063 --> 15:45.497
Bye-bye.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.434
I'm sorry, what
is going on here,

15:49.469 --> 15:50.969
Hodgins?
Hey. Well,

15:51.004 --> 15:52.704
I've harnessed
these shock cords to the ground

15:52.739 --> 15:54.472
using dichromatic hooks lifted

15:54.508 --> 15:56.274
by an anchor pulley.
We

15:56.309 --> 15:58.309
built a human slingshot.
Yes. To figure out

15:58.345 --> 16:01.112
how far the body
dropped into the river.

16:01.148 --> 16:04.282
Okay. Uh, we could've used
the Angelatron for that.

16:04.317 --> 16:06.751
It wouldn't have
been as accurate.

16:06.787 --> 16:08.086
Excuse me?

16:08.121 --> 16:11.256
Uh... Tell her. Tell her why.

16:12.793 --> 16:15.627
Yeah, okay. Um, right,
so-so here's why.

16:15.662 --> 16:17.796
So I-I took a sample
of the Potomac River,

16:17.831 --> 16:19.631
you know, where
the body was found

16:19.666 --> 16:21.966
and I-I had to recreate
the viscosity, the temperature,

16:22.002 --> 16:23.902
as well as
the particulate matter in order

16:23.937 --> 16:24.508
to try and...

16:24.532 --> 16:26.548
I-I could've entered
those variables.

16:27.207 --> 16:29.207
Sweet wife,

16:29.242 --> 16:31.309
please let a man have his toys.

16:31.344 --> 16:33.945
Barrett taught us that we
learn better by using

16:33.980 --> 16:36.781
our hands-- the kinesthesiology
of knowledge.

16:36.817 --> 16:38.650
Show her how it works, Curly.
Yeah,

16:38.685 --> 16:41.486
so what we do is
we actually take a dummy,

16:41.521 --> 16:44.656
we hoist it up using
the pulley system,

16:44.691 --> 16:47.058
and then...
we let her rip.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.761
We need to duplicate
the victim's injuries

16:49.796 --> 16:52.297
by matching the force impact
into the water.

16:53.533 --> 16:54.999
Okay.

16:55.035 --> 16:58.069
Here we go.

17:00.507 --> 17:02.807
Angie, would you
like to do the honors?

17:02.843 --> 17:05.676
You know Cam is
gonna kill us.

17:14.186 --> 17:16.454
Oh.

17:16.489 --> 17:19.790
All right, the sensors show
that the ribs and skull

17:19.826 --> 17:21.559
didn't hit the water
with sufficient impact.

17:21.595 --> 17:23.194
What the hell is this?

17:24.364 --> 17:27.665
Hi. Oh, um, this,
uh, here, um...

17:27.701 --> 17:30.535
This is the kinesthesiology
of-of knowledge.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.537
And this couldn't
have been done

17:32.572 --> 17:34.839
on your multimillion-dollar computer?
Uh, no.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.208
No. It couldn't, actually.
I tried, but...

17:37.244 --> 17:39.477
Such a drag-- it just
didn't work out, so we're

17:39.512 --> 17:41.779
here... with this.

17:48.421 --> 17:51.122
And now we have
to do it all again

17:51.157 --> 17:53.858
with more force.

17:53.894 --> 17:55.360
Hey. Let her.

17:55.395 --> 17:58.730
Um, Cam, would you
like to help us out

17:58.765 --> 18:00.598
by pulling the lever?

18:02.168 --> 18:04.302
God.

18:12.012 --> 18:14.445
Me next.

18:15.982 --> 18:18.349
So the killer had to be
able to drag the victim

18:18.385 --> 18:21.119
to the bridge, tie on the
weights and throw him off.

18:21.154 --> 18:22.635
Well, Jen Park, she's a strong
woman.

18:22.659 --> 18:24.490
She could do that.
It appears as if Jen and Hayes

18:24.491 --> 18:26.291
have had a long-standing rivalry.
Well, the only problem

18:26.326 --> 18:28.259
is Jen is hiding behind
a lot of expensive lawyers.

18:28.295 --> 18:30.395
So you need more to bring her in?
I need more.

18:30.430 --> 18:32.630
I need a lot more.
Angela is trying to decrypt

18:32.666 --> 18:34.699
Hayes Robertson's laptop.
Perhaps she'll find

18:34.734 --> 18:36.968
some correspondence
between the two.

18:37.003 --> 18:39.604
Perhaps, right.

18:39.639 --> 18:42.907
So, Bones, you know, I've been
thinking about Christine.

18:42.943 --> 18:46.010
And school. Right?
There's a great public school

18:46.046 --> 18:48.846
right in our area. The
neighborhood kids, they love it.

18:48.882 --> 18:51.182
There's a great playground there, it's...
So you want to stop

18:51.217 --> 18:54.419
looking and settle
because of a playground?

18:54.454 --> 18:56.921
No, I'm not saying that.
Look, I trust you,

18:56.957 --> 18:58.656
all right, and your take
on all this. I went to

18:58.692 --> 19:00.725
five schools
before I was nine. And you?

19:00.760 --> 19:03.127
12 before university.
And you know what?

19:03.163 --> 19:05.596
We turned out fine.
Better than fine.

19:05.632 --> 19:07.432
I hated it.

19:07.467 --> 19:11.102
I had no consistency. I had
to make a way for myself

19:11.137 --> 19:14.405
when I was too young to do it.
I want to give Christine more.

19:14.441 --> 19:17.642
I want her to have a better
life than I did growing up.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.610
- Brennan.
- Hey, Dr. B.

19:19.646 --> 19:23.014
So the body was dropped
from a height of 85 to 95 feet.

19:23.049 --> 19:25.216
Now, there's only
one bridge on the Potomac

19:25.251 --> 19:27.785
within that height range
that's upstream from

19:27.821 --> 19:29.120
where the body washed up.

19:29.155 --> 19:30.488
Hodgins found the bridge

19:30.523 --> 19:32.156
from where the body
was thrown. If we can

19:32.192 --> 19:34.792
retrieve the arms,
perhaps we can

19:34.828 --> 19:36.260
get cause of death or at least

19:36.296 --> 19:37.795
discover some
defensive injuries.

19:37.831 --> 19:39.397
Well, okay,
I'll call Aubrey

19:39.432 --> 19:42.367
and see if we can get a team
of divers to search for them.

19:43.670 --> 19:45.903
What-What

19:45.939 --> 19:48.239
was that noise, Dr. Hodgins?
Oh, just confirming

19:48.274 --> 19:52.143
our data. You can
never be too thorough.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.362
The divers found the arms
under the bridge

19:57.363 --> 19:58.763
tied to the weight.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.598
The water kept them
in good shape.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.734
Guy had nice guns.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.038
There are deep lacerations
and defensive wounds

20:07.073 --> 20:09.574
along both
arms and hands.

20:09.609 --> 20:13.044
We need to untie the wrists
and prep them for X rays.

20:13.079 --> 20:16.681
Ooh. These suckers are tied tight.
Perhaps

20:16.716 --> 20:18.616
I can assist.
Assist?

20:18.651 --> 20:19.917
That's a first.
Well, Ms. Warren

20:19.953 --> 20:21.919
is used to a cooperative
environment, I...

20:21.955 --> 20:23.955
I thought I would see
what it was like.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.890
Did the earth
stop spinning, too?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.993
I visited McLaughlin's
Web site and read

20:29.028 --> 20:31.696
his mission statement. I
expected to be displeased

20:31.731 --> 20:34.232
by his disdain
for private schools'

20:34.267 --> 20:36.367
competitive
and elitist focus.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.469
While a hopeless
idealist,

20:38.505 --> 20:41.706
his theories have a clean and

20:41.741 --> 20:44.475
inviting logic to them.
Too bad you and Christine

20:44.511 --> 20:47.545
can't join now that
the cooperative's disbanding.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.660
The idea of a communal wardrobe
wouldn't work for me.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.149
Oh, God.
Me neither.

20:51.184 --> 20:54.051
Nearly all of these wounds
are perimortem.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.320
So we can rule out turtles.
Please swab

20:56.356 --> 20:59.190
and clean the bones as quickly
as possible, Ms. Warren.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.258
And you'll assist?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.493
No.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.433
How's the hack going?

21:09.469 --> 21:12.270
Ah, slowly but surely. Hey,
you don't have to come here

21:12.305 --> 21:14.472
for an update, you know.
I know.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.140
But, you know, all
this equipment...

21:16.176 --> 21:17.942
Come on. How
cool is this?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.377
Yeah, and then there's me.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.046
So,

21:22.081 --> 21:25.832
unfortunately, Hayes Robertson
was a brilliant programmer.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.695
Who happened to be
an anal control freak.

21:27.719 --> 21:28.587
Yeah.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.987
But that's the good part.

21:30.023 --> 21:32.557
Guys like Hayes--
everything they do is digital.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.993
And it's all saved.
E-mails, meetings.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.162
I can tell you
where he went, what he ate.

21:38.198 --> 21:43.034
I'm gonna start decrypting it now.
It's incredibly cool.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.969
I'm sensing
a little computer envy.

21:45.004 --> 21:48.005
Well, ah, I just got
an awesome new laptop.

21:48.041 --> 21:50.908
Little smaller than this,
but not the size, right?

21:50.944 --> 21:53.644
No. It's... it's the size.

21:57.917 --> 22:00.551
While I'm waiting for
the arms to be cleaned,

22:00.587 --> 22:02.420
I reexamined the ribs.

22:02.455 --> 22:05.156
I found remodeled microfractures
on the sternal rib ends

22:05.191 --> 22:08.025
bilaterally on ribs
eight and six, and

22:08.061 --> 22:11.095
two additional fractures on the
fourth rib on the right side.

22:11.130 --> 22:12.897
What caused them?

22:12.932 --> 22:15.900
I'm feeling they're punches
because of what he was into.

22:15.935 --> 22:17.301
It's true, the games were
violent fighting games.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.904
And look at the pattern.
There's six of them.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.739
Is six relevant?
Yeah.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.742
According to the video that
Aubrey took on his cell phone.

22:24.777 --> 22:28.946
There. Four ascending
symmetrical punches up the ribs

22:28.982 --> 22:31.182
followed by two left blows.

22:31.217 --> 22:34.285
These injuries match the moves
made by the giant Minotaur.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.059
When can I get
my bones, Curly?

22:42.095 --> 22:44.762
Soon. I added Tergazyme
to speed up the process.

22:44.797 --> 22:46.564
Because if we can match
the injuries on these arms

22:46.599 --> 22:48.165
to the injuries we
just found on the ribs,

22:48.201 --> 22:49.767
we might find
cause of death.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.236
You're pressuring me.
Is it working? 'Cause I want

22:52.272 --> 22:53.871
to show Dr. Brennan

22:53.907 --> 22:56.040
that genius and flaky
aren't mutually exclusive.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.576
Okay, all right, I guess a bit
more Tergazyme couldn't hurt.

22:58.611 --> 23:01.012
So, how have you been?

23:01.047 --> 23:03.714
That's the opening line of
a very boring conversation.

23:03.750 --> 23:07.118
No. I just mean that now that
Professor McLaughlin's leaving,

23:07.153 --> 23:08.552
and your commune...
Cooperative.

23:08.588 --> 23:11.022
...cooperative
is-is breaking up.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.757
It's no biggie.

23:12.792 --> 23:15.359
Barrett said change is
the one reality we can count on.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.063
Trying to hang on to our
expectation-- that is death.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.831
Yeah, but these are the people
that you grew up with.

23:20.867 --> 23:22.233
I mean, that's your family.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.835
Yeah, and they always
will be wherever we are.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.637
Wow. That's a very healthy way

23:26.673 --> 23:30.341
to look at the diaspora
of your commu... operative.

23:30.376 --> 23:32.443
Hmm. They look done.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.612
Yeah. You want to do the honors?
Mm-hmm.

23:47.460 --> 23:50.328
I think I'm in the
mood for ribs tonight.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.931

I'm a loony bin ♪

23:53.967 --> 23:56.067

24:07.513 --> 24:10.247
That cute squint laid out the
specific six-punch combination

24:10.283 --> 24:12.383
that would have caused the
injuries to the victim's body.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.986
That cute squint?
Yeah, my bureau training taught me

24:15.021 --> 24:16.587
to be precise when
using language.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.422
She's a squint,
and she is cute.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.557
Yeah.
Got it.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.962
Dude, that's it. That's
the six-punch combo right there.

24:24.998 --> 24:26.430
That'd be our guy.
It's got to be our guy.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.565
FBI. Take a break, huh?

24:27.600 --> 24:29.300
I don't care who you are.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.535
We're in the middle of something
here. Get off my stage.

24:31.537 --> 24:33.000
Okay, I don't think he understands.
He doesn't understand.

24:33.001 --> 24:35.100
Okay, hi.
We're from the FBI.

24:35.124 --> 24:36.208
Oh, you're from

24:36.209 --> 24:39.043
some sort of cop game. Then
you should know about ruining

24:39.078 --> 24:41.445
an entire sequence. Now get off
my stage before I make you.

24:41.481 --> 24:44.382
Okay, you just need to relax
there, Mr. Lite-Brite, okay?

24:44.417 --> 24:46.183
We have permission
to be here, okay?

24:46.219 --> 24:47.885
I am Special Agent Booth.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.454
I warned you.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.889
He doesn't understand.

24:51.924 --> 24:53.290
That was a big mistake, buddy.

24:53.326 --> 24:54.992
Okay.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.195
Oh. Okay, that was
a bigger mistake.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.563
Aah. Shoulder's
hurting, rotator cuff.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.032
You want to
get this one?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.433
Sure.
Okay.

25:04.404 --> 25:06.270
Look at that.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.571
We restrained a Manotaur.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.073
Uh, Minotaur.
Whatever.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.475
<i>I admit it.</i>

25:11.511 --> 25:13.878
I beat up Hayes...
but he deserved it.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.980
Hayes Robertson employed you
for over six years.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.581
That didn't give him the
right to steal my idea.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.983
As if he wasn't
rich enough.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.951
What idea?
I came up with <i>The Crusher.</i>

25:20.987 --> 25:22.620
He took credit for it.

25:22.655 --> 25:24.822
- That game's even based on my move.
- Your move.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.124
Wow. I'm thinking
the boss betrays him,

25:27.160 --> 25:28.225
and he wants revenge.

25:28.261 --> 25:30.528
Okay. Okay, look.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.496
I was out one night
across town at, like, 2:00 a.m.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.632
when I randomly ran
across Hayes on the street.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.067
I confronted him about
stealing my game.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.335
He called me a troll,
which I'm not.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.571
I'm a Minotaur.
So, I beat him up.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.007
You used the same move on him
that he programmed

25:43.042 --> 25:44.542
into the game.
Irony, right?

25:44.577 --> 25:46.610
He just forgot about it?
He didn't fire you or anything?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.146
I expected it,
but after I punched him,

25:49.182 --> 25:51.882
Hayes went down, and this
really expensive bracelet

25:51.918 --> 25:53.250
fell out of
his pocket.

25:53.286 --> 25:55.052
How'd you know
it was really expensive?

25:55.088 --> 25:57.154
I used to work security for a
jewelry dealer, and believe me,

25:57.190 --> 25:58.823
these diamonds were real
and big.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.659
Anyway, Hayes just grabbed
the bracelet and ran off.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.627
Next day, I'm waiting to get
fired, and all he said was,

26:03.663 --> 26:05.329
"Don't worry about it.
It never happened."

26:05.364 --> 26:06.597
Okay, so you're telling me

26:06.632 --> 26:08.099
that he was willing to forget

26:08.134 --> 26:10.301
about the beating
because of a bracelet?

26:10.336 --> 26:11.769
Look on his face.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.538
He wanted me to keep quiet
about that bracelet.

26:14.574 --> 26:18.676
I don't know why, but he was
willing to happily bleed for it.

26:29.018 --> 26:31.619
So this is what was on
Hayes Robertson's computer?

26:31.654 --> 26:34.188
Yeah, I got everything from
million-dollar video game ideas

26:34.223 --> 26:37.388
to e-mails from
Nigerian bankers.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.226
Anything more than

26:38.227 --> 26:39.659
snooping on his
private life?

26:39.694 --> 26:41.227
Well, no. That was enough.

26:41.263 --> 26:43.663
The cloud updated everything
from his phone,

26:43.698 --> 26:45.031
including everywhere he went.

26:45.066 --> 26:48.034
Oh, because of the GPS on his cell.
Right.

26:48.069 --> 26:51.104
Now, these are the places
he visited in the past month.

26:51.139 --> 26:53.106
Isn't this where he
was beaten up by

26:53.141 --> 26:55.642
Travis Leete?

26:58.713 --> 27:00.713
316 North Sycamore Avenue.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.115
Yeah, it's a location

27:02.150 --> 27:04.250
he's visited six times
in the past month.

27:04.286 --> 27:06.286
And according
to the time stamps,

27:06.321 --> 27:07.921
usually in the middle
of the night.

27:07.956 --> 27:09.622
Sounds like he was
having an affair.

27:09.658 --> 27:13.226
A single 26-year-old guy
doesn't need to sneak around.

27:13.261 --> 27:16.496
Maybe he was seeing
a married woman.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.666
Agent Booth, it's Aubrey here.

27:19.701 --> 27:21.134
Listen, I think I found out

27:21.169 --> 27:22.969
where Robertson was going
with that bracelet.

27:23.004 --> 27:25.138
So Angela did find the apartment?
Yeah.

27:25.173 --> 27:27.507
But no one's here.
Who's on the lease?

27:27.542 --> 27:29.909
Well, that's the interesting
part. Chloe Blanchard.

27:29.945 --> 27:31.311
Robertson was visiting
his roommate's girlfriend?

27:31.346 --> 27:32.745
That's what it looks like.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.280
All right, well, bring her in.

27:34.316 --> 27:35.648
I'd love to,
but the place is empty.

27:35.684 --> 27:38.151
Looks like Chloe grabbed
her stuff and moved out.

27:38.186 --> 27:39.719
And there's nothing there?
No way to find her?

27:39.754 --> 27:41.154
Well, Angela pulled the images

27:41.189 --> 27:42.755
off her social media accounts.

27:42.791 --> 27:45.024
She ran Chloe's picture
against online images using

27:45.060 --> 27:46.526
facial recognition software.

27:46.561 --> 27:48.428
- Okay, well, did she get a hit?
- Yeah.

27:48.463 --> 27:50.730
Chloe was tagged in multiple
pictures, two of which

27:50.765 --> 27:52.799
- were taken today in Wexford.
- Wexford.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.500
That's only, what, like, 30
miles away. I'll tell you what.

27:54.536 --> 27:55.702
I'll get a local P.D.
and have 'em pick her up.

27:55.737 --> 27:57.103
Okay, but in the pictures,

27:57.138 --> 27:59.339
Chloe was tagged
under a different name.

27:59.374 --> 28:01.841
Tell them they'll be looking
for an Alice Kelly.

28:01.876 --> 28:03.743
Wait a second. You're telling me
that she moved

28:03.778 --> 28:05.945
to the next town over
and changed her name?

28:05.981 --> 28:07.914
My guess is, she knows she got
herself in the middle

28:07.949 --> 28:09.382
of something
she wants nothing to do with.

28:09.417 --> 28:10.977
Right, well, you know,
just pick her up.

28:10.986 --> 28:12.518
Maybe she can tell us
what she knows about Noah.

28:12.554 --> 28:14.087
I know if I found out

28:14.122 --> 28:15.521
my best friend was sleeping
with my girlfriend,

28:15.557 --> 28:17.357
I'd have a murderous thought
or two.

28:17.392 --> 28:20.326
I feel guilty
not being at the lab.

28:20.362 --> 28:23.429
I don't. I found the
girl, so I can chill.

28:23.465 --> 28:26.032
And you have Jessica,
so, you can, too.

28:26.067 --> 28:27.967
You'll feel guiltier

28:28.003 --> 28:32.171
when Christine grows up and
says you worked too much.

28:32.207 --> 28:33.906
It's nice spending time
together,

28:33.942 --> 28:35.775
just us, like we used to.

28:35.810 --> 28:40.246
Yeah, except now we're talking
about day care rather than sex.

28:40.282 --> 28:42.548
I had extremely satisfying sex
last night, actually.

28:42.584 --> 28:44.984
It began in the tub.

28:45.020 --> 28:47.920
You guys like the tub, don't you?
Yes.

28:47.956 --> 28:50.423
When Hodgins and I feel
like getting a little crazy,

28:50.458 --> 28:51.958
we go to the kitchen.

28:51.993 --> 28:53.393
We always get
hungry afterwards,

28:53.428 --> 28:55.295
so then we just
don't have to move.

28:55.330 --> 28:56.829
I can't fault
your logic. Christine?

28:56.865 --> 28:58.197
You have reached
your maximum

28:58.233 --> 28:59.565
potential energy
on the swing.

28:59.601 --> 29:01.434
Lower your center
of gravity, please.

29:01.469 --> 29:04.971
Does she actually know
what you're saying?

29:05.006 --> 29:06.372
Of course.

29:06.408 --> 29:08.074
Michael Vincent?

29:08.109 --> 29:10.310
If you run up that
slide one more time,

29:10.345 --> 29:12.178
I'm never feeding
you again.

29:12.213 --> 29:14.814
He understands me, too.

29:17.152 --> 29:20.486
Do you think I'm incapable
of being open to new ideas?

29:20.522 --> 29:22.355
Is this about
Jessica's commune?

29:22.390 --> 29:23.756
Cooperative, but yes.

29:23.792 --> 29:25.792
I want to guarantee
Christine will have

29:25.827 --> 29:27.860
the best possible education,
but some of these schools

29:27.896 --> 29:29.228
that are so free-form, I'm...

29:29.264 --> 29:32.432
I don't know how
to trust something

29:32.467 --> 29:36.769
with no formal structure.

29:36.805 --> 29:38.504
Well, do you want to?

29:38.540 --> 29:41.307
Well, I think it would be
a good balance for Christine

29:41.343 --> 29:44.777
since she lives with me,
but I don't know if I can.

29:44.813 --> 29:47.080
Hmm. You know, the
way I figure it,

29:47.115 --> 29:48.881
they're going to
blame us for everything

29:48.917 --> 29:50.717
that goes wrong in
their lives anyway,

29:50.752 --> 29:54.487
so you might as well just do
what feels right for you.

29:54.522 --> 29:56.723
I'm not sure what that is.

29:56.758 --> 29:59.225
Although I didn't think I would
like the tub the first time.

30:01.596 --> 30:03.629
Brennan.

30:03.665 --> 30:05.898
Okay.

30:05.934 --> 30:07.667
Yes, I'll be right there.

30:07.702 --> 30:09.268
Uh, that was Ms. Warren.

30:09.304 --> 30:11.537
She found some carpal fractures.
Do you think that you...?

30:11.573 --> 30:13.373
Yeah, I'll drop them
back off at day care,

30:13.408 --> 30:15.208
and I'll be ten behind you.
Thanks.

30:15.243 --> 30:16.776
Yeah.
Christine?

30:22.951 --> 30:25.218
Where are the fractures,
Ms. Warren?

30:25.253 --> 30:28.254
I found postmortem
carpal fractures

30:28.289 --> 30:29.722
in the trapezium,
lunate and scaphoid,

30:29.758 --> 30:31.991
where the victim was tied
to the heavy weight.

30:32.026 --> 30:33.793
None of which would
kill the victim.

30:33.828 --> 30:36.462
Right, but I also
found two splintered

30:36.498 --> 30:38.931
fractures on the
humerus. The plotting

30:38.967 --> 30:41.234
of the fractures indicates
blunt force trauma

30:41.269 --> 30:43.302
by a rounded weapon.

30:43.338 --> 30:45.738
The angle at which the weapon
splintered the humerus

30:45.774 --> 30:48.508
would have caused a laceration
to the subclavian artery.

30:48.543 --> 30:50.476
Causing the victim to go
into irreversible shock

30:50.512 --> 30:52.211
within minutes
while he bled to death.

30:52.247 --> 30:54.013
You found cause
of death, Ms. Warren.

30:54.048 --> 30:55.982
I did my part, but <i> we</i> found it.

30:56.017 --> 30:59.952
I'll have Dr. Hodgins
swab the humeral fractures.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.754
Already did.

31:01.790 --> 31:04.624
Oh.

31:04.659 --> 31:06.526
How long am I going to be here?

31:06.561 --> 31:08.661
Well, you know, that really
depends on you, Noah.

31:08.696 --> 31:10.863
The sooner you cooperate, the
sooner you can get out of here.

31:10.899 --> 31:12.331
I'm cooperating.

31:12.367 --> 31:14.267
You know, we just recently
found out that your

31:14.302 --> 31:16.169
good buddy Hayes was visiting
your girlfriend Chloe

31:16.204 --> 31:17.737
repeatedly at night.

31:17.772 --> 31:19.539
Doesn't make any sense.
Kind of makes sense to me.

31:19.574 --> 31:20.907
She is a good-looking girl.

31:20.942 --> 31:22.342
We think they were
having an affair.

31:22.377 --> 31:23.743
It's not possible.

31:23.778 --> 31:25.978
Definitely is possible,
and if you found out

31:26.014 --> 31:28.114
about that, you probably
would become very angry.

31:28.149 --> 31:29.515
I know Hayes,
I know Chloe.

31:29.551 --> 31:31.651
Neither of them
would ever do that!

31:31.686 --> 31:33.453
You just need to settle down.
Then stop lying

31:33.488 --> 31:34.954
to me.
I'm not lying. I'm just

31:34.989 --> 31:36.522
presenting you the facts.

31:36.558 --> 31:38.357
Agent Booth, she's here.
I just told her

31:38.393 --> 31:40.059
to wait outside.
Right. Come on in.

31:40.094 --> 31:42.495
Who is? Chloe? She's here?

31:42.530 --> 31:44.897
Uh... ask her.

31:44.933 --> 31:46.365
She'll tell you
she never cheated on me.

31:46.401 --> 31:48.134
She loves me.
Ask her. Chloe?

31:48.169 --> 31:49.035
Just settle down.

31:49.070 --> 31:49.969
No. Chloe!

31:50.004 --> 31:51.037
Hey...

31:51.072 --> 31:54.106
Hi. This is
so crazy,

31:54.142 --> 31:56.843
but you didn't sleep with Hayes,
right? You love me.

31:56.878 --> 31:57.977
Tell 'em.

31:58.012 --> 32:00.480
Who the hell are you?

32:09.336 --> 32:11.409
So Noah's never
even met Chloe

32:11.409 --> 32:13.176
in person?
No, look, he only knew

32:13.211 --> 32:14.978
of her online.

32:15.013 --> 32:16.713
But she doesn't know him at all.

32:16.748 --> 32:19.315
Because that girl right there
is not the one

32:19.351 --> 32:20.583
that he was chatting with, okay?

32:20.619 --> 32:22.252
She is just
an innocent bystander.

32:22.287 --> 32:24.420
Okay, Hayes
Robertson, okay,

32:24.456 --> 32:28.658
stole images of her on
the Internet and created Chloe.

32:28.693 --> 32:30.362
So Chloe never changed her name
to Alice.

32:30.385 --> 32:31.794
Aubrey,

32:31.796 --> 32:34.464
she was always Alice.

32:34.499 --> 32:37.934
Hayes catfished Noah.
Exactly.

32:37.969 --> 32:39.836
Since he knew
that Noah never left his place,

32:39.871 --> 32:41.704
he could keep the scam going
because these two

32:41.740 --> 32:43.026
would probably never meet.

32:43.050 --> 32:44.375
Guy was a control freak,
all right?

32:44.376 --> 32:46.776
He created Chloe in order
to control his best friend.

32:46.811 --> 32:48.216
If Noah didn't know
he was being catfished

32:48.240 --> 32:49.647
and he'd never met Chloe before,

32:49.648 --> 32:51.447
then he doesn't have
a motive to kill Hayes.

32:51.483 --> 32:52.882
Are you with me now?
Mm-hmm.

32:52.918 --> 32:55.084
I'll go talk to him.
You stay here.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.886
I'm so embarrassed.

32:56.922 --> 32:58.821
I thought
I was talking to you every day.

32:58.857 --> 32:59.857
I sent you gifts.

32:59.858 --> 33:02.191
You did? Really?
Yeah.

33:02.227 --> 33:05.862
This... beautiful bracelet.
Diamonds.

33:05.897 --> 33:07.497
I thought you'd love it.

33:07.532 --> 33:09.465
Diamonds?
'Cause of your eyes.

33:09.501 --> 33:13.503
The way they shine,
they remind me of diamonds.

33:13.538 --> 33:15.204
I'm sorry.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.941
I'm an idiot.
Uh, no. No, I,

33:17.976 --> 33:19.876
um...

33:19.911 --> 33:22.278
Thanks.

33:23.915 --> 33:25.548
He sent me
jewelry.

33:25.583 --> 33:27.483
No, no. He didn't s...

33:27.519 --> 33:30.720
No, Alice, he didn't send you
jewelry, okay?

33:30.755 --> 33:32.622
He sent Chloe jewelry.

33:32.657 --> 33:36.059
Got it? Okay, so...
neither one of you

33:36.094 --> 33:38.494
had any idea
about what was going on here?

33:38.530 --> 33:39.696
Not at all.
No.

33:39.731 --> 33:41.497
You never saw
or talked

33:41.533 --> 33:42.699
to Hayes Robertson?

33:42.734 --> 33:44.801
I never even heard of him
before now.

33:44.836 --> 33:47.837
I can't believe
he would do that to you.

33:47.872 --> 33:50.573
I mean, you're so... sweet.

33:50.608 --> 33:53.509
I don't think so.
No, you are. If he wasn't dead,

33:53.545 --> 33:54.444
I'd kill him myself.

33:54.479 --> 33:56.479
It's just...
none of this

33:56.514 --> 33:59.315
makes any sense.
I know it's hard for you to take

33:59.351 --> 34:01.517
all this in right now,
but, Hayes...

34:01.553 --> 34:03.686
your buddy was a bad guy.

34:03.722 --> 34:05.922
I mean it-it literally
doesn't make sense.

34:05.957 --> 34:08.157
If Hayes was Chloe
this whole time,

34:08.193 --> 34:10.259
then who have I been chatting
with online all week

34:10.295 --> 34:11.494
after he died?

34:11.529 --> 34:13.696
You kept talking to him?
Chloe was saying

34:13.732 --> 34:15.264
she wanted to break up.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.734
I was trying to save my relationship.
I would never

34:17.768 --> 34:18.701
break up online.

34:18.737 --> 34:19.802
Alice.

34:19.838 --> 34:20.803
I'll give you
my computers,

34:20.839 --> 34:22.772
my-my phone. Check the logs.

34:22.806 --> 34:25.108
It couldn't have been Hayes.

34:25.143 --> 34:26.743
Do you
really think

34:26.777 --> 34:28.411
my eyes shine?

34:32.751 --> 34:35.518
Hey, so I used
the scanning electron microscope

34:35.553 --> 34:37.920
and pyrolysis and found flakes
of gray paint

34:37.956 --> 34:39.621
in the humeral fractures,
as well

34:39.657 --> 34:42.257
as polypropylene particulates.
Motion capture markers.

34:42.293 --> 34:44.159
Please explain.
The sensor balls

34:44.195 --> 34:47.030
used on motion capture suits
to make 3-D animation.

34:47.065 --> 34:49.672
Like the type the video game
actors wore at Immersion.

34:49.696 --> 34:50.467
That's right. Yeah.

34:50.467 --> 34:52.777
So the gray paint plus
the motion capture markers...

34:52.801 --> 34:54.283
Combined with
the depression fracture

34:54.284 --> 34:55.705
on the skull caused
by a flat surface weapon...

34:55.739 --> 34:57.139
As well as the
blunt force trauma

34:57.175 --> 34:59.275
to the humerus caused
by a rounded edge.

34:59.310 --> 35:00.710
I know the weapon.

35:02.814 --> 35:05.483
This is the video that Aubrey
shot on his cell phone.

35:05.507 --> 35:06.583
The shield.

35:06.584 --> 35:10.586
It has a flat surface with a
rounded edge. It's painted gray

35:10.622 --> 35:12.355
and has motion capture markers
on it.

35:12.390 --> 35:14.424
It has to be the weapon.
Yeah. Here is where we really

35:14.459 --> 35:17.393
hit the jackpot. I accessed
Immersion's server

35:17.429 --> 35:20.296
through Robertson's computer
to see if there was any data

35:20.331 --> 35:22.265
captured by the markers
on the shield.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.201
So it turns out that the murder
took place on the gaming stage,

35:25.236 --> 35:29.605
so we have a full 3-D
motion capture video of it.

35:31.276 --> 35:33.209
Is it still
rendering?

35:33.244 --> 35:34.577
No, this is

35:34.612 --> 35:36.279
all Robertson's
computer captured.

35:36.314 --> 35:38.081
Because neither the
murderer nor the victim

35:38.116 --> 35:39.949
wore motion capture suits.
So...

35:39.984 --> 35:41.951
all we have is the movement
of the murder weapon.

35:41.986 --> 35:45.154
That's all I need. Please
replay the video using

35:45.190 --> 35:49.225
a figure of Robertson's
physique. And then

35:49.260 --> 35:51.227
have the
movements

35:51.262 --> 35:54.130
and the strikes determine the
assailant's height and weight.

35:56.534 --> 35:58.801
The assailant was
approximately five-eight,

35:58.837 --> 36:00.736
120 pounds.

36:00.772 --> 36:04.040
And the killer
was also right-handed

36:04.075 --> 36:05.441
but had
more power

36:05.477 --> 36:07.810
with swings arcing
from the left.

36:07.846 --> 36:10.146
From the size, probably a woman

36:10.181 --> 36:13.516
who was weaker
on her dominant side.

36:13.551 --> 36:15.384
<i>- Anne Schamberg?</i>
<i>- Yeah, Noah said</i>

36:15.420 --> 36:18.020
when he dated her, it was
actually Robertson who set them up.

36:18.056 --> 36:20.523
Hayes Robertson set up his
best friend with his programmer,

36:20.558 --> 36:22.058
then turned around
and broke them up.

36:22.093 --> 36:23.459
Right. They were
actually talking

36:23.495 --> 36:25.394
about moving in together.
But Robertson

36:25.430 --> 36:26.929
didn't like that
because he wouldn't be able

36:26.965 --> 36:28.698
to control them anymore.
He created Chloe

36:28.733 --> 36:30.833
to break them up, okay?
What, it's a perfect way

36:30.869 --> 36:33.035
to keep his best friend
and his best programmer

36:33.071 --> 36:34.303
in his pocket,
right?

36:34.339 --> 36:36.172
Whoa. Okay, there you are.
Yes.

36:36.207 --> 36:37.773
Stuck in traffic?

36:37.809 --> 36:39.976
I've been here.
All right, let's go.

36:40.011 --> 36:42.345
So you failed to mention
that Noah broke up with you

36:42.380 --> 36:44.280
because of Chloe.

36:44.315 --> 36:45.615
I don't see why that's relevant.

36:45.650 --> 36:47.683
You suspected
Robertson was behind it.

36:47.719 --> 36:49.118
You see, Robertson,
he's a control freak.

36:49.154 --> 36:51.387
So what do you do?
You confronted him and,

36:51.422 --> 36:53.356
what, he humiliated you, right?

36:53.391 --> 36:55.358
Made fun of you.
And that's when you snapped.

36:55.393 --> 36:57.994
Which is why you killed him.
No, I didn't.

36:58.029 --> 37:01.397
No, that's when you took over
Chloe's online account, right?

37:01.432 --> 37:04.233
So that you could pretend
to be Chloe, right?

37:04.269 --> 37:07.370
Break up with Noah and you could
have him all to yourself.

37:07.405 --> 37:09.272
That's ridiculous.

37:09.307 --> 37:12.175
Can you take your cardigan off
and stand up, please?

37:12.210 --> 37:13.509
Why?
Let's not make this any more difficult

37:13.545 --> 37:15.611
than it has to be,
Ms. Schamberg.

37:21.819 --> 37:24.086
She's your killer, Booth.

37:24.122 --> 37:24.566
What?

37:24.589 --> 37:26.890
We subpoenaed your medical
files. In high school,

37:26.991 --> 37:27.924
you ruptured

37:27.959 --> 37:29.292
your right patellar tendon

37:29.327 --> 37:30.826
and tore the meniscus

37:30.862 --> 37:31.994
in the same knee.

37:32.030 --> 37:34.330
So?
So years of dealing

37:34.365 --> 37:36.799
with a significantly weaker
right knee would cause you

37:36.834 --> 37:38.301
to compensate for the injury.

37:38.336 --> 37:41.003
The muscle mass in the left side
of your body became

37:41.039 --> 37:43.973
approximately five percent
bigger than your right.

37:44.008 --> 37:45.708
Really?

37:45.743 --> 37:48.878
Yes. It would
also cause her to move

37:48.913 --> 37:51.914
exactly like this
when she killed Hayes Robertson

37:51.950 --> 37:54.450
on the video stage.

38:03.661 --> 38:06.028
I love Noah.

38:06.064 --> 38:09.966
I asked Hayes,
why would he break us up?

38:10.001 --> 38:12.902
He laughed and said we were
just characters in his game.

38:12.937 --> 38:15.171
We're people.

38:15.206 --> 38:17.173
Noah and I are people.

38:17.208 --> 38:20.643
We just wanted a life together.

38:22.814 --> 38:25.248
We just wanted
a life together.

You want any help?

38:54.012 --> 38:57.713
Oh. No, thanks.
I am almost done.

38:57.749 --> 39:02.218
Well, then can I maybe buy
you an after-arrest drink?

39:02.253 --> 39:04.387
Man, I would love that,
but Angie and I--

39:04.422 --> 39:06.455
we got to get home to the little guy.
Oh, yeah.

39:06.491 --> 39:08.157
Yeah, that's fine. It's fine.

39:08.192 --> 39:10.126
Totally get it.

39:10.161 --> 39:12.328
You okay?

39:12.363 --> 39:14.463
Yeah. Why?

39:14.499 --> 39:18.634
Because you just lost your home
today and you don't seem okay.

39:18.670 --> 39:21.003
Uh, I told you...

39:21.039 --> 39:23.439
change is one of the foundations
of the cooperative.

39:23.474 --> 39:25.207
Without change,
there is no life.

39:25.243 --> 39:27.043
Right. But sometimes change
can be painful,

39:27.078 --> 39:29.378
and we can hate it. Like
the transient receptor potential

39:29.414 --> 39:31.881
in <i> Drosophila melanogaster.</i>

39:37.889 --> 39:39.855
I have no idea what that is,

39:39.891 --> 39:43.659
but it's probably right.

39:43.695 --> 39:46.362
- Uh...
- Whoa.

39:46.397 --> 39:47.763
Whoa, wh-what did you do to her,

39:47.799 --> 39:49.265
Hodgins?
He was just really,

39:49.300 --> 39:52.335
really confusing
and really, really nice.

39:59.110 --> 40:01.344
I lost everything.

40:01.379 --> 40:03.446
I lost
my family.

40:03.481 --> 40:06.649
Well, thank God
you're not trying to hold it

40:06.684 --> 40:08.484
together anymore.

40:08.519 --> 40:09.985
Come on. You're
coming home with us.

40:10.021 --> 40:11.421
After Michael Vincent
goes to sleep,

40:11.422 --> 40:13.055
we're gonna open
a bottle of Barolo

40:13.091 --> 40:15.057
and...
No, um,

40:15.093 --> 40:16.959
you know, I can't. Um...

40:16.994 --> 40:18.728
No, I can't.

40:18.763 --> 40:23.532
So the only family that you can
be a part of is that commune?

40:23.568 --> 40:25.167
Come on.
Get your stuff.

40:25.203 --> 40:26.702
You're coming home with us.
Come on.

40:26.738 --> 40:29.739
Okay.

40:29.774 --> 40:32.375
But it's a cooperative.

40:38.616 --> 40:41.584
Ooh.
Noah and Alice went off together?

40:41.619 --> 40:44.220
Yeah, they really hit it off.
I mean, I guess there really is

40:44.255 --> 40:45.988
a silver lining,
even in...

40:46.023 --> 40:48.257
murder. Whoa, whoa. Wait
a second. What's this?

40:48.292 --> 40:49.145
No work at home, remember?

40:49.168 --> 40:51.168
This is my research
for Christine's schools.

40:51.429 --> 40:52.759
Oh, no, Bones.

40:52.782 --> 40:54.906
After reading
Professor McLaughlin's book,

40:54.907 --> 40:58.308
I realized that my expectations
were as rigid

40:58.344 --> 41:00.111
as my approach
to finding the right school.

41:00.112 --> 41:01.578
So all the
ratings and the...

41:01.613 --> 41:03.346
kindergarten
language requirements, what,

41:03.382 --> 41:04.936
are you just gonna toss those
out the door?

41:04.960 --> 41:05.549
Yes.

41:05.550 --> 41:07.083
I'm leaving them to you.

41:07.119 --> 41:08.952
Me?

41:08.987 --> 41:11.588
Yes. You are far more
open-minded than I am.

41:11.623 --> 41:15.358
And since I would never consider
wearing a beer hat in the tub,

41:15.394 --> 41:16.760
far less rigid.

41:16.795 --> 41:18.361
Well, thanks, Bones. I...

41:18.397 --> 41:20.930
That's a compliment, right?
More of a statement

41:20.966 --> 41:24.190
of fact.
You can choose any of these.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.056
I've pre-screened them

41:25.057 --> 41:26.406
so you're only dealing
with the best.

41:26.430 --> 41:27.524
The best.

41:27.941 --> 41:30.642
What about the, uh, public
school down the road?

41:30.676 --> 41:32.809
It's not in there.
I've listed my reasons

41:32.845 --> 41:36.513
on page four. Of course,
you can choose it if you'd like.

41:36.548 --> 41:38.949
So if all this goes
wrong, it's my fault.

41:38.984 --> 41:42.853
Yes. But I-I trust
you'll make the right decision.

41:42.888 --> 41:44.821
Why do I feel
like this is not a victory?

41:44.857 --> 41:48.191
I feel remarkably good, actually.
Mm-hmm.

41:48.227 --> 41:51.595
And, um, speaking of the tub...

41:51.630 --> 41:53.897
Really?

41:53.932 --> 41:55.966
Mmm...

41:56.001 --> 41:59.102
Well, the dishes are done,
Christine's asleep...

42:00.506 --> 42:02.906
Yes!
No beer hat, Booth.

42:02.941 --> 42:05.842
I will fill 'er up.

42:05.878 --> 42:08.147
N... Booth, come on. No beer
hat.

42:08.171 --> 42:09.714
I'm not that open-minded.
Come on.

42:09.715 --> 42:10.737
You were last night.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.086
I'm far too rigid
to enjoy something like that.

42:13.087 --> 42:15.631
Rigid? The hat'll help.
Come on. One sip.
