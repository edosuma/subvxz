00:17.660 --> 00:18.830
Hey, Wills.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.550
Morning, Kate. Just getting things
ready for George and Charlotte.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.750
Gosh, when you said you want to be a
hands-on dad, you really meant it,

00:25.800 --> 00:28.750
- didn't you? - Oh, I just want
to do what any other dad does...

00:28.800 --> 00:30.550
Put off working full-time
till I'm 40,

00:30.600 --> 00:33.030
and take the kids up the park
in their sedan chair...

00:33.080 --> 00:35.310
How are you coping with all
your new royal duties?

00:35.360 --> 00:37.510
I find, if you really embrace
these things,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.230
they hardly seem like work at all.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.110
Like that royal premiere
the other night.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.910
It was really just like
going to see a film,

00:42.960 --> 00:46.470
except you get driven there in a
big car, and meet Ryan Gosling.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.920
You know, I really did marry a
remarkable woman.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.870
Wotcha, you two. There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
Meghan Markle.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.150
Oh, my God! Wills and Kate!

01:00.200 --> 01:02.670
Yah, please do call us
Wills and Kate.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.990
The way you handle the spotlight
is such an inspiration.

01:06.040 --> 01:08.790
As you know, I've had to deal
with many of the same issues,

01:08.840 --> 01:12.030
since I was catapulted to fame
as a regular on Suits.

01:12.080 --> 01:13.750
Yah, that's a TV show?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.110
- Of course. - Yah.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.710
My character's a strong, fiercely
intelligent woman, like me.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.830
Yeah, but she's still
a sexual being.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.550
Which is why she's
always in her bra.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.070
You see, she's an empowered,
independent woman,

01:25.120 --> 01:26.390
who knows what she wants.

01:26.440 --> 01:29.470
- Like me. - Meghan's feeling a little
unsure of herself,

01:29.520 --> 01:31.750
I'm taking her to meet Dad
and Camilla later.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.150
Well, I could give you a few
pointers if you like.

01:34.200 --> 01:37.870
- Would you? - Good idea, those two can
be a lot more formal than us.

01:37.920 --> 01:41.070
I think er said the
Dresden china, Baines.

01:41.120 --> 01:43.110
Let us begin now.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.390
Uh-huh.

01:44.440 --> 01:47.950
Listen, bro, I'm worried about this
meeting with Dad and Camilla.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.950
You know Great Uncle Edward
had to abdicate

01:50.000 --> 01:52.310
because he fell in love with
an American divorcee?

01:52.360 --> 01:54.350
Harry, that's amazing,
how do you know that?

01:54.400 --> 01:55.910
I'm watching The Crown on Netflix.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.310
Well, Meghan is
an American divorcee.

01:58.360 --> 02:00.430
So now I'm worried I'm going
to have to give it all up

02:00.480 --> 02:01.470
and live in France.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.150
And I can't be expected to learn
another language.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.550
That was 80 years ago.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.750
The modern Royal Family's
completely different now.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.000
No, Baines, that's the Davenport.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.110
Sorry. Sorry.

02:17.160 --> 02:18.510
Sorry.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.910
Oh, God.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.430
That awful woman
Theresa May is here.

02:22.480 --> 02:25.470
You're just jealous cos
she's got real power.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.430
She has to rule by democracy.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.390
Whereas I ruled by the
Divine Right of Kings.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.750
When you say rule, do you mean open
the Chelsea Flower Show?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.710
The right honourable Theresa May.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.350
Ah, Prime Minister.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.510
Can we offer you a drink?

02:38.560 --> 02:39.870
Just water, please.

02:39.920 --> 02:43.030
I've recently installed
a re-bed filtration system

02:43.080 --> 02:44.830
to recycle the household waste,

02:44.880 --> 02:47.880
so that glass of water you're
drinking is actually my urine.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.630
It's delicious.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.590
Now then, Britain's in crisis.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.670
- Thanks to you. - Since Brexit,
we've got no-one left to trade with,

02:55.720 --> 02:57.830
so we're trying to do a deal
with the Chinese,

02:57.880 --> 03:00.390
and it's vital you host
a royal lunch.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.070
You know my position on China.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.750
That cavalier attitude
towards the environment.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.790
But you travel everywhere
on a huge private jet.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.230
Which is offset by my
huge private forest.

03:09.280 --> 03:11.070
That was planted
in the 12th century.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.830
I still have to prune it!

03:12.880 --> 03:14.400
You'll do what you're told.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.390
I am a man of principle,

03:17.440 --> 03:19.470
which is why it was
such hell conducting

03:19.520 --> 03:22.270
an extramarital affair
with her for 15 years.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.030
- I won't. - Yes, you will.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.110
I won't.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.150
You're the worst Prime Minister
since Gordon Brown.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.990
I hate you.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.470
Charles!

03:31.520 --> 03:33.320
Charles, come back here at once!

03:35.640 --> 03:38.110
I'm so sorry about my husband.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.030
Just get him to host this lunch.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.710
And you don't have to apologise,

03:41.760 --> 03:43.630
I didn't get into this job
to make friends.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.440
Oh, I don't have any friends either.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.430
Maybe we could grab a coffee
some time.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.440
Do this, and we can have
as much coffee as you like.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.550
- Hello, Auntie Anne. - So, you want to
get back on the sovereign grant,

04:02.600 --> 04:05.870
do you? Mm? Not happy with your
Uncle Charles' new, slimmed down,

04:05.920 --> 04:08.270
- Royal Family? - We just feel
we could help.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.230
Oh, do you?

04:10.280 --> 04:14.040
Well, let's see what you were
up to in, let's say, 2015.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.589
Goodness me. You did do a lot.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.829
- Thank you, Auntie Anne.
- Of sunbathing!

04:19.880 --> 04:23.550
Greece, Bahrain, Rome, the Bahamas,

04:23.600 --> 04:25.870
Roman Abramowitz's yacht in Ibiza.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.750
We needed to unwind
from our high pressure jobs.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.630
You don't stick at anything
for more than a couple of months.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.870
I've got toilet rolls that last
longer than you do.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.590
- And are a lot more useful.
- It's not our fault.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.470
We don't have the work ethic.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.270
It's been bred out of us.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.790
But we are bubbly.

04:41.840 --> 04:45.070
When people meet someone royal,
they don't want bubbly!

04:45.120 --> 04:46.870
They want someone stern,
and austere,

04:46.920 --> 04:50.430
who'll create a bit of an
atmosphere. Someone dead inside,

04:50.480 --> 04:53.990
who's clearly the victim
of some unspecified trauma.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.990
In short, me.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.440
Sorry to have troubled you.

04:58.520 --> 04:59.750
And yet...

04:59.800 --> 05:01.390
there is something you
could help with.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.830
There's a royal lunch
for the Chinese coming up.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.670
And you want us to attend in
a royal capacity?

05:06.720 --> 05:08.480
No. I want you to do the catering.

05:10.480 --> 05:14.390
That one's for grouse, that's for
partridge, and that's for swan.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.950
That's a lot for a humble TV
actress like me to process.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.070
You'll be fine.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.670
I'm a gypsy, and I managed it.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.270
I see. So there's a piece of you
who's still gypsy Kate,

05:24.320 --> 05:26.310
who always tells it how it is?

05:26.360 --> 05:29.910
Kind of like my character in Suits,
and then there's Princess Kate,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.350
who has a quiet,
understated dignity.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.230
A bit like my character in Suits.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.950
It's true, but in here,
I'm Catherine.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.990
Changed my name to Kate at uni
so I didn't seem such a stiff.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.120
Oh, my God! That's exactly like
my character in Suits!

05:44.760 --> 05:46.910
Hello. Who's this?

05:46.960 --> 05:49.790
Oh, Pippa, um, this is Meghan.

05:49.840 --> 05:52.390
- Meghan Markle?
- You know me from Suits?

05:52.440 --> 05:54.070
No, The Mail Online.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.310
Hasn't Harry done well for himself?

05:57.360 --> 05:58.670
So have I.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.670
You know Harry,
he's the kindest, warmest,

06:01.720 --> 06:03.550
sexiest, funniest, cutest,

06:03.600 --> 06:06.680
most generous, charming, handsome
man in the whole world.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.110
I'm marrying a billionaire.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.110
Pippa, it's a bit vulgar
to talk about money.

06:11.160 --> 06:13.630
That's a one, with nine
noughts after it.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.750
Ah! I'm late for twerk-a-cise.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.960
I have to stay in shape,
for my TV show, Suits.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.910
Oh... Are you an actress?

06:25.040 --> 06:27.550
How fucking dare you have
her round here!

06:27.600 --> 06:30.120
She's nervous. Just like I was.

06:31.680 --> 06:35.630
You see, for a while, I didn't feel
I belonged in the Royal Family.

06:35.680 --> 06:38.310
But now I do. I really do.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.790
And I'm ready to be Britain's Queen.

06:41.840 --> 06:43.830
You know you said that out loud?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.950
And you know what Harry meant to me.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.510
You've got Johnny now.

06:47.560 --> 06:48.830
Yes, I do.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.390
And I'm in love with him.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.110
And he just bought
me a special ticket,

06:52.160 --> 06:54.510
which means I can go to Wimbledon
whenever I like.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.630
Well, I shall see you there,
because I've just been made patron
of Wimbledon.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.310
I'm going to hand out the trophies.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.950
You fucking what?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.670
What qualifies you for that?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.190
Well, I do really like tennis.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.710
But I really like tennis!

07:05.760 --> 07:08.670
Yes, but you've got to really like
tennis and be...

07:08.720 --> 07:10.750
Go on. Say it.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.510
And be...

07:12.560 --> 07:13.910
a royal.

07:13.960 --> 07:15.590
So, there it is.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.310
I've had enough of this.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.390
I'm going to put
a gypsy curse on you.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.190
Pippa, you can't put a gypsy curse
on me just because

07:22.240 --> 07:24.470
- I've become patron of Wimbledon.
- Watch me.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.350
May your hand be shaky and old

07:28.400 --> 07:30.200
when it touches anything gold.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.310
Oh, Pippa! I won't be able to
hand over the trophy.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.630
Exactly.

07:35.680 --> 07:39.310
And the curse can only be lifted
if I perform an act of kindness.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.750
But you've never done anything kind
your whole life.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.840
I know.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.190
Charles, you don't think
this dress is, um,

08:02.240 --> 08:04.240
too tight? Do you?

08:05.840 --> 08:06.870
Shall we?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.110
I don't think we'll be doing
any of that for a while.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.550
Not unless you change your mind
about this Chinese lunch.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.350
Absolutely not.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.400
Shame.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.920
Oops! Clumsy.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.150
Oh, my God!

08:26.200 --> 08:28.870
Ah, they're right there.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.990
Just a light buff, please.

08:31.040 --> 08:34.390
- Excuse me? - Oh, Dad, she's not here
to clean your shoes.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.950
This is Meghan. My girlfriend.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.710
Oh, right, yes. Of course.

08:38.760 --> 08:42.950
Sorry about that. It's just the
woman who cleans my shoes is also...

08:43.000 --> 08:44.520
a woman.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.760
Not now!

08:48.160 --> 08:49.990
Delighted to meet you, my dear.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.470
Hey, Pops!

08:51.520 --> 08:54.070
- I love you. - Yes, that was nice.

08:54.120 --> 08:58.350
And you, you have been an
inspiration of the whole world.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.390
I can't deny it.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.710
And by the way, you don't look
anything like 90.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.830
- What? - You could be 80.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.350
- Well, 85. - That's not the Queen,
that's the stepmum.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.230
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.870
It's cos you're so sun-damaged.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.870
All I heard was 90.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.680
Come on, Meghan, we can start
getting our bibs on.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.070
I think I really made a connection
with your folks.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.630
Yah, absolutely.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.510
She's nice. Sparky.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.270
About this lunch, Theresa's awfully
keen for you to host it.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.750
The thought of sitting down and
eating with her

09:30.800 --> 09:32.190
makes me physically sick.

09:32.240 --> 09:35.470
The way that woman talked to me
was utterly disrespectful.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.040
She's a jumped up little oik who has
no business even meeting us.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.870
Blimey.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.030
I'm going to have to abdicate.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.720
Like Edward V one, one, one.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.030
We deserve this.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.750
24 hours to go, and we've already
organised the catering

09:54.800 --> 09:56.710
- for an entire state banquet. - Yah,

09:56.760 --> 10:00.150
that one call to Fortnum and Mason's
was pretty tiring.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.390
Hello, girls.

10:01.440 --> 10:03.190
Mummy, have you been invited?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.670
No, that's why I'm here a day early.

10:05.720 --> 10:10.950
I like to get in before the security
cordon goes up, and hide in a box.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.550
Ooh, that's a possible.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.430
Ooh, I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.070
Remember what happened when you got
your freckly bangers out

10:17.120 --> 10:19.990
- at the French state dinner? - I was
on prescription painkillers.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.510
And I need to get in.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.230
I've got to penetrate the Asian
market with my right royal juicer.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.670
I'm sorry, Mummy.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.910
We can't risk you
bollocking this up.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.190
We're trying to get back on the
sovereign grant.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.910
No, you're right, girls.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.280
I'll go. And I definitely won't try
and hide in that box.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.230
- Hello, Your Highness. - Emma.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.710
You remembered?

10:48.760 --> 10:51.710
I still can't believe you're here
at mums and toddlers group,

10:51.760 --> 10:54.750
instead of...
stopping elephant poachers.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.910
No, parenting's much more important.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.400
I mean, look how well little George
is fitting in.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.880
He's made a mess.
No rest for the wicked.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.440
Nanny!

11:11.760 --> 11:14.510
- HRH Prince Wills. - It's about this
lunch for the Chinese...

11:14.560 --> 11:16.630
- Ya? - I wondered if you might host it.

11:16.680 --> 11:21.710
- I can't. I'm putting in the hours to
be a proper part of my children's
lives. - Here's your cup of tea.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.870
Camilla's so desperate for me to do
it, she's gone on strike.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.830
- From what? - From the boudoir.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.150
You think just because women
are late 60s we don't do it?

11:30.200 --> 11:32.190
- All right, Dad.
- We're every-nighters.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.790
Our whole relationship has been

11:33.840 --> 11:36.070
a relentlessly sordid
sexual adventure,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.790
breaking every taboo,
and now she's shut up shop.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.710
- And I'm getting rather... - Gloomy?

11:40.760 --> 11:41.760
Backed up.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.120
Look, Dad, I've got to go.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.190
I give up.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.910
Camilla!

11:49.960 --> 11:52.990
You look done in. What time
are your staff getting here?

11:53.040 --> 11:55.830
- How do you mean?
- Well, it's nearly lunchtime.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.990
Who's going to feed little Dean?

11:58.040 --> 11:59.910
Well, I will.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.550
'Oh, my God.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.990
'I'm not a hands-on dad at all.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.680
'I'm just a posh bloke
with a nanny.'

12:15.280 --> 12:16.990
Well, that's cleared the custard.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.880
It's from Theresa.

12:21.800 --> 12:22.990
Oh.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.830
She must be very busy,
she's forgotten emojis.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.590
Now nothing stands in the way of
getting what I've always wanted.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.070
Your first female friend?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.470
- Exactly. - Care for a mug
of cocoa to celebrate?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.950
Why not?

12:38.000 --> 12:40.440
Two large cocoas, please, Ken.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.150
It gives me great pleasure,
as patron of Wimbledon,

12:56.200 --> 13:00.830
to present you, Andy Murray,
with the All England Cup,

13:00.880 --> 13:03.120
which is made entirely of gold.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.120
Ah! I can't hold on to it!

13:08.560 --> 13:11.670
Ah, you've fucked up
my fucking foot!

13:13.080 --> 13:14.510
Kate!

13:14.560 --> 13:18.710
Wills, Wills, I just dreamt
Andy Murray really swore at me.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.030
Oh, darling, Wimbledon's
going to be easy.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.320
All you have to do is pick up the
gold cup and give it to the winner.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.470
Even a non-royal could do that.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.470
I'm just being silly, aren't I?

13:29.520 --> 13:32.150
- What are you doing?
- Making the kids sandwiches.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.910
I've given Nanny the day off.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.270
But who's going to take the kids
to the park with you?

13:36.320 --> 13:37.510
No-one.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.630
- But don't you think...
- I know it sounds crazy,

13:41.680 --> 13:44.110
but it's something I've got to do,
for me.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.560
I understand.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.910
Camilla.

13:58.960 --> 14:00.400
Theresa!

14:02.360 --> 14:03.750
You're looking very regal.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.270
You're looking very powerful.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.710
We make quite a team.

14:06.760 --> 14:07.960
Yes.

14:09.720 --> 14:11.030
Excuse me, everyone,

14:11.080 --> 14:14.190
I have a message from the
newly retired Prince Philip.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.430
"Dear funny foreigners,

14:16.480 --> 14:19.710
"don't think, just cos I'm not
there, that you can nick stuff.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.670
"I've made an inventory, and if
anything's missing tomorrow,

14:23.720 --> 14:25.510
"I will fuck you up.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.040
"All the best, Phil."

14:30.880 --> 14:34.670
Well read. Oh, and you've also been
asked to present the state gift

14:34.720 --> 14:36.310
to the Chinese president.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.990
- What is it?
- Some sort of gold bowl, I think.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.270
What?

14:40.320 --> 14:41.680
The gypsy curse!

14:44.400 --> 14:47.270
How did she know I called her that?

14:47.320 --> 14:50.190
Now, Pippa, I met Harry's
new girlfriend the other day.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.430
Wouldn't be surprised
if we hear wedding bells.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.030
Not worried she's
a little old for him?

14:54.080 --> 14:56.230
Oh, no, no, she's so pretty.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.590
Probably the prettiest girl
he's ever been out with.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.110
I went out with him.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.630
Oh, it's no slight on you.

15:01.680 --> 15:04.160
It's just she's
really, really pretty.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.150
♪ The wheels on the Rolls
go round and round

15:09.200 --> 15:12.110
♪ All day long

15:12.160 --> 15:15.070
♪ The chauffer on the Rolls says,
Morning, Your Highness... ♪

15:15.120 --> 15:17.270
No nanny today, Wills?
I'm proud of you.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.030
- We all are. - Thanks.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.510
As you're doing so well, we just
wondered if you'd look after

15:21.560 --> 15:24.030
- the kids for an hour.
- On my own? - Yeah.

15:24.080 --> 15:27.030
Well, they love you. It's just,
River Island's got a sale on

15:27.080 --> 15:29.310
and me and the other mums fancied
a quick look.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.750
Sorry, "River Island"?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.150
It's a shop.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
And "sale"?

15:34.280 --> 15:36.510
It's where they lower the prices.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.600
Do you think they'll be
all right, or...?

15:40.080 --> 15:41.870
Yeah, yeah,
you go for it, I've got this.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.230
Great, thanks, Wills.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.240
You, you're gonna make
a fabulous king.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.670
You've got to want it, Roger.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.470
Own that stick.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.030
And let's see some swagger out of
there with the hanky, Nigel.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.910
And remember, big finish.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.470
- What's going on? - Oh, we thought
we'd have some entertainment.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.550
And we put Edward in charge of it.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.270
Why the fuck would you do that?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.230
Don't you remember
it's a Royal Knockout?

16:09.280 --> 16:11.950
John Travolta and Meatloaf
were chased by Sheena Easton,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.750
dressed as an enormous cockerel.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.350
- TV gold. - Oh, shut up.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.430
How could you put
this imbecile in charge?!

16:17.480 --> 16:19.710
I don't think you should talk
like that about Edward,

16:19.760 --> 16:21.990
- when he's still in the room.
- Oh, that's all right,

16:22.040 --> 16:24.230
I've been called an imbecile
to my face many times.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.430
And worse.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.630
Christ!

16:26.680 --> 16:27.840
What's an imbecile?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.320
I thought we had a deal!

16:38.000 --> 16:41.040
You promised if I gave you all
the sugary drinks you'd behave!

16:42.120 --> 16:43.630
This is a nightmare.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.790
Think this is a nightmare?
Try besieging Jerusalem

16:47.840 --> 16:50.550
- with a bucket on your head.
- Richard the Lionheart?

16:50.600 --> 16:53.110
That's right. And I didn't get
called Lionheart

16:53.160 --> 16:55.590
by looking after small children
while their mums went to

16:55.640 --> 16:57.150
the River Island sale.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.270
So you're saying I should go
to the Chinese lunch,

16:59.320 --> 17:00.670
and not be such a hands-on dad?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.350
Of course. You should be dealing
with matters of state,

17:03.400 --> 17:06.990
demonstrating tact and diplomacy,
like I did on the Crusades.

17:07.040 --> 17:09.990
When I slaughtered countless
infidels and recaptured Jerusalem.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.190
But you didn't recapture Jerusalem.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.270
Shut up!

17:13.319 --> 17:15.550
At least I don't have to change
Finton's nappy.

17:15.599 --> 17:16.910
Oh, has he?

17:16.960 --> 17:18.310
About half an hour ago.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.990
You're right.
I should go to the lunch.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.440
Thanks, Richard the Lionheart.
You're a ledge.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.640
Emma, it's Prince William, time
to make your way to the tills.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.240
The thing about granite worktops is,
they're wipe clean.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.950
'Gold, why did it have to be gold?'

17:39.000 --> 17:42.870
Sir, we have kiln smoked Scottish
salmon, Wye Valley asparagus,

17:42.920 --> 17:44.240
and Cornish scallops.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.920
I did it. I am a waitress.

17:54.120 --> 17:55.830
To take this unique product,

17:55.880 --> 17:59.270
which isn't just an ordinary juicer
with my face stuck on it...

17:59.320 --> 18:00.920
What the... Fergie!

18:01.960 --> 18:04.710
How dare you risk ruining today
with your tawdry attempts

18:04.760 --> 18:07.590
- to line your own pockets.
- Well, it's all right for you.

18:07.640 --> 18:08.870
You survived the cull.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.270
You're still part of the new slimmed
down royal family.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.910
- Yeah, what about us?
- Where's our free money?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.800
Free money? Is that what you think
being a royal is about?

18:19.160 --> 18:21.120
- Partly. - Get out, all of you.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.030
You're fired!

18:30.080 --> 18:32.510
But what will we do?
Where will we go?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.590
Apart from our four-bedroom
grace-and-favour apartment?

18:35.640 --> 18:37.080
Maybe a holiday?

18:48.520 --> 18:49.790
Oh, Pippa.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.840
What's up?

18:52.960 --> 18:56.590
Dad can't stand Meghan, so I'm gonna
have to give up being a royal,

18:56.640 --> 18:59.030
like Edward V, one, one, one did.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.390
Meghan says she can get me a job on
Suits, which is great,

19:01.440 --> 19:03.070
cos I can speak a bit of American.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.390
You'd leave me?
I mean, leave Britain?

19:05.440 --> 19:08.510
I have to. I can't perform my royal
duties without the support of the

19:08.560 --> 19:11.270
- woman I love.
- You don't have any royal duties,

19:11.320 --> 19:12.790
apart from going to the rugby.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.350
Exactly. With her by my side,
I can get pissed,

19:15.400 --> 19:16.640
cos she can drive.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.430
Anyway.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.960
Your dad really loves Meghan.

19:23.400 --> 19:24.720
He told me.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.320
Really?

19:29.480 --> 19:30.480
Thanks.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.430
That was really kind of you.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.470
'That was really kind of you.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.750
'That was really kind of you.'

19:38.040 --> 19:40.670
Everyone, just before we go in
to lunch...

19:40.720 --> 19:43.790
Mr President, as a mark of the
mutual respect between

19:43.840 --> 19:46.350
our two countries,
I would like to present you

19:46.400 --> 19:49.840
with this magnificent gold bowl.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.800
Kate!

20:04.560 --> 20:06.600
I did it! The gypsy curse
has been broken!

20:10.800 --> 20:13.480
I mean, I bet this will
look lovely on your sideboard.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.430
Have I missed mains?

20:22.480 --> 20:24.670
- You came! - Of course.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.910
So you're not going to be a hands-on
dad any more, then?

20:26.960 --> 20:29.320
No. This is where I'm most use.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.600
Yes, I can. The toilets are down the
hall, second on the left.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.070
Mr President, for decades now,

20:39.120 --> 20:41.550
I've considered your country's
energy policy

20:41.600 --> 20:43.910
a disgusting affront to
Mother Nature.

20:43.960 --> 20:47.230
Which is why I've come up with this,
my envirobox.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.430
It produces all the energy you need,
no cost at all,

20:50.480 --> 20:52.070
and its pollution free.

20:52.120 --> 20:57.070
It sucks in the weather here, and
the electricity comes out here.

20:57.120 --> 21:00.190
~

21:00.240 --> 21:01.910
The president asks how it works.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.190
Oh, it's for others to work out
the detail.

21:04.240 --> 21:06.270
The point is, it'll help your
regime become

21:06.320 --> 21:07.640
that little bit less evil.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.870
Were you just talking to the
president about the environment?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.350
Yes, my envirobox.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.030
I mean, obviously, at the moment
it's just an empty ice cream tub,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.990
painted green, but when the backroom
boys get hold of it,

21:20.040 --> 21:21.590
it's gonna be a game changer.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.270
We seem to have a crossed wire here.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.750
No-one gives a fuck
what you think about anything.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.430
You're here to caper about in your
stupid little panto costume

21:28.480 --> 21:30.510
until he signs the trade deal
tomorrow.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.350
So I suggest you and your deluded,
tragedy of a wife

21:34.400 --> 21:36.600
leave everything else
to the grown-ups!

21:40.200 --> 21:41.910
What the...

21:41.960 --> 21:44.670
Good bell work, Harry.
Don't force it.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.390
You never wanted to be my friend.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.830
You used me.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.230
Of course. If I didn't have a trade
deal to sort,

21:50.280 --> 21:52.360
I wouldn't give you the steam
off my piss.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.320
~

22:31.120 --> 22:33.040
His Excellency say...

22:34.320 --> 22:37.440
.."superb demonstration of strength
and pageantry."

22:38.840 --> 22:40.960
The trade deal is on.
The trade deal is on!

22:49.200 --> 22:51.560
She will rue the day she crossed me.

22:52.760 --> 22:55.470
And I have some very powerful
allies.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.950
Yes, you do.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.680
Not you, you, idiot.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.360
Donald J Trump.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.960
Begin!

23:09.240 --> 23:11.400
I'm your father's
identical twin brother.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.160
Just this massive penis, please.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.310
Show the future king
your freckly bangers.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.640
I will be taking heroin.

23:22.840 --> 23:24.390
Let's cut the BS!

23:24.440 --> 23:25.830
Why are you shouting, Donald?

23:25.880 --> 23:27.680
Because I'm erratic!

23:28.305 --> 23:34.400
