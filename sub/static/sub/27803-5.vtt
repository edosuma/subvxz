Previously on Siren.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.537
[groans]

00:07.540 --> 00:10.031
[Xander] Just want
to know where he is,
the one who killed my dad!

00:10.040 --> 00:11.530
That's the reason you can't
go back in the water.

00:11.540 --> 00:13.531
You help me with my problem,
I help you with yours.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.246
_I sense
he IS one of us.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.569
I knew I was different.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.536
Addiction, mental illness,

00:18.540 --> 00:20.952
rare autoimmune condition.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.200
Stop!

00:22.210 --> 00:23.529
[Maddie screams]

00:23.540 --> 00:26.498
Your mother. My sister.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.161
Gone.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.785
-Cute place.
-Glen, what are you
doing here?

00:29.790 --> 00:30.950
I need you, Susan.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.574
You need me, too.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.411
Maddie,
when did you get home?

00:35.420 --> 00:37.661
[gasps] You're high.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.411
Ben is in my dream.

00:42.420 --> 00:44.490
[Maddie]
You might just be scared
of your feelings for him.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.206
[Ryn]
Who do you think about?

00:46.210 --> 00:47.609
[Maddie] Ben.

00:47.620 --> 00:48.700
And you.

00:52.540 --> 00:56.909
[female singer]
I been breathin'
underwater for your love

00:59.960 --> 01:03.828
I been breathin'
underwater for your love

01:03.830 --> 01:07.823
You been starting wars,
burning bridges

01:07.830 --> 01:13.279
Learning all my flaws,
like religion

01:13.290 --> 01:18.455
You been drownin'
underwater for my love

Ooh-ohh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

01:22.880 --> 01:26.202
Ooh-ooh
ooh-ooh ooh-ooh

01:26.210 --> 01:28.246
This is my kingdom

01:28.250 --> 01:30.957
And I'm never comin' down

01:33.290 --> 01:35.497
This is my kingdom

01:35.500 --> 01:38.207
And I'm never comin' down

01:40.120 --> 01:42.076
I rule on my own

01:42.080 --> 01:43.991
This is my throne

01:44.000 --> 01:47.709
This is my crown,
and I'll never let go

01:47.710 --> 01:49.826
This is my kingdom

01:49.830 --> 01:51.821
And I'm never comin' down

This is my kingdom come

01:59.330 --> 02:03.369
[Cami releases piercing call]

02:03.380 --> 02:07.111
I will rule from my throne

02:07.120 --> 02:09.372
This is my kingdom

And I'm never comin' down

02:11.580 --> 02:14.378
This is my, this is my

02:14.380 --> 02:16.075

This is my crown,
and I'll never let go

02:21.420 --> 02:23.240
This is my kingdom

02:23.250 --> 02:25.457
This is my, this is my

02:28.420 --> 02:31.708

02:31.710 --> 02:35.328
[placid high-pitched call]

02:45.580 --> 02:46.706
Good morning.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.991
That was nice.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.376
Being together
last night.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.200
Yes.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.199
Together.

02:58.210 --> 03:01.282
Yeah, it was.

03:01.290 --> 03:05.613
When we kiss,
why do Ben and Maddie stop?

03:08.420 --> 03:09.660
[laughs]

03:11.670 --> 03:16.243
Well, we thought maybe
you weren't ready to...

03:16.250 --> 03:17.740
do more.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.787
Yes. Ryn wants more.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.377
In water, we mate.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.029
On land, we mate, too,

03:29.040 --> 03:30.075
but we also...

03:31.080 --> 03:32.206
make love.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.609
Make love?

03:33.620 --> 03:35.872
Yeah. It's, uh--
It's like mating,

03:35.880 --> 03:39.111
just not for making babies.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.496
Wsumm

03:40.500 --> 03:42.320
Mostly we do it
because it, um--

03:42.330 --> 03:44.286
because it feels good.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.076
Because we love
the person.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.327
I don't think mating
feels so good for them,

03:52.330 --> 03:54.070
especially the males.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.119
The females, uh,
they bite them,

03:58.120 --> 04:00.111
they hit them
with their tails.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.959
Sometimes males die
from too much mating.

04:06.330 --> 04:09.037
Right.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.168
Um, on land,
it feels better
when things are equal.

04:12.170 --> 04:13.569
Equal?

04:13.580 --> 04:16.117
The same.
It feels good for everyone.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.078
Everyone gives love
and gets love.

04:22.210 --> 04:25.702
In water,
female, male not equal.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.075
Maybe this is bad?

04:28.080 --> 04:32.073
No, not bad,
just different.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.662
And on land, things aren't
always equal, either.

04:40.830 --> 04:42.991
I would like to make love.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.706
With Ben and Maddie.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.072
I think we'd like that.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.741
Yeah.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.826
Sister's daughter's gone.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.161
[Ben] What?

05:15.330 --> 05:17.070
Maybe she went
to see the others.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.570
Helen, it's Maddie.

05:20.580 --> 05:24.493
Damn! They can't
keep doing this.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.287
They're nocturnal,
I'm not.

05:33.330 --> 05:35.457
Okay, I'm not gonna lie.
This is, uh...

05:35.460 --> 05:36.996
This is probably
gonna hurt, all right?

05:38.540 --> 05:39.871
Ready?

05:42.380 --> 05:44.200
VVhoa!

05:44.210 --> 05:47.202
Yesterday,
your guts were hanging out.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.952
Today, you're healed.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.411
[Xander sighs]

05:53.420 --> 05:54.876
All right, so, um...

05:54.880 --> 05:56.279
So I think this is gonna work.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.747
Our little arrangement?
Win-win.

05:58.750 --> 06:00.377
I scratch your back...

06:00.380 --> 06:01.495
[hisses]

06:03.250 --> 06:05.912
Maybe that's, um...

06:05.920 --> 06:07.319
We both want the same thing.

06:07.330 --> 06:08.410
You want to get back
in the water,

06:08.420 --> 06:10.411
I want that, too.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.115
I'll figure out a way
to make that happen.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.781
[wave strikes, boat creaks]

06:13.790 --> 06:14.825
And you,

06:17.330 --> 06:19.571
you're gonna help me get
the one who killed my dad.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.706
Okay.

06:25.710 --> 06:26.995
Let's do this.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.779
Katrina.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.202
[engine starts]

06:49.000 --> 06:50.240
-Stop!
-[hisses]

06:50.250 --> 06:51.740
Down. Now.

06:51.750 --> 06:54.036
Not safe to change.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.530
Only when you need.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.245
That's why they came here?

06:58.250 --> 07:00.377
They want to be in water.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.608
In their natural state.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.201
[hisses]

07:03.210 --> 07:04.950
Someday,
you can go back home.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.371
Just not right now.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.741
Oh. Thank God,
they're here.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.990
I brought
a little bit of food.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.246
There's not much, Ryn.

07:23.250 --> 07:24.660
They're going
to have to share.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.529
You eat now.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.200
You eat with them.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.739
Go.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.489
[hisses]

07:45.620 --> 07:46.666
[hisses]

07:50.460 --> 07:51.950
You eat.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.279
Hey! Where you going?

08:15.170 --> 08:17.286
Hey!

08:17.290 --> 08:18.450
Hey, come back here!
We had a deal!

08:18.460 --> 08:20.576
-Come on!
-[hisses]

08:20.580 --> 08:22.457
-Okay.
-[hisses]

08:22.460 --> 08:24.451
Fine! Fine, just...

08:24.460 --> 08:26.416
do it your way.

08:29.830 --> 08:32.287
[Cami hisses]

08:32.290 --> 08:33.530
[hisses]

08:36.000 --> 08:37.661
It was important,
what you did.

08:37.670 --> 08:39.535
For them to stay here,

08:39.540 --> 08:41.872
they have to let go
of the old ways.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.029
And it won't be forever.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.411
Yes. I know.

08:48.710 --> 08:50.450
Okay. We go.

08:50.460 --> 08:51.870
Ben.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.199
Uh, yeah, sure,
you can come with me.

08:53.210 --> 08:55.201
I got work to do.

08:55.210 --> 08:56.609
Come on.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.786
I'll keep
a good eye on them.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.411
Is he okay here
on his own?

09:13.540 --> 09:16.873
Yes. He protects.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.324
It is good for him.

09:29.620 --> 09:30.917
[door closes]

09:39.790 --> 09:41.371
[young girl]
Spaghetti for you!

09:41.380 --> 09:44.531
-[echoing] Spaghetti for you!
-[woman laughs]

09:44.540 --> 09:46.872
Mommy, I love you.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.785
[woman] Watch! Slide!

09:51.790 --> 09:53.667
VVhee!

09:55.170 --> 09:57.377
I really need
to go check on my mom.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.575
I've avoided her
long enough.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.741
[Ryn]
Mother makes you sad.

10:01.750 --> 10:02.910
I can handle it.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.496
[children laughing]

10:17.620 --> 10:18.746
Come.

10:32.250 --> 10:35.117
You have pain. Inside.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.326
Mother.

10:47.330 --> 10:48.615
[soft hiss]

11:07.330 --> 11:08.456
I bring you to her.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.417
[seagulls calling]

11:23.830 --> 11:25.491
[typing]

11:27.750 --> 11:29.615
Oh, uh, hey.

11:29.620 --> 11:33.033
Finally. You guys really
set your own hours
around here, huh?

11:33.040 --> 11:37.113
Uh, yeah, things
have been a little
unpredictable lately.

11:38.710 --> 11:42.373
That is, uh, Levi,
my intern.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.415
Hey, Levi, what's up?

11:45.790 --> 11:49.453
So what's, uh...
What's going on?

11:51.120 --> 11:53.076
Look, I owe you a thank you.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.457
You told me that
Klesco Oil was connected
with those beached whales?

11:55.460 --> 11:56.449
Yep.

11:56.460 --> 11:57.609
You were right.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.030
They were dragging
that sonic cannon,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.076
like you said,
mapping the ocean,

12:01.080 --> 12:02.411
and looks like they found
something down there.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.376
What did they find?

12:04.380 --> 12:08.703
Oil. Or, actually, the, uh...
the potential for oil.

12:08.710 --> 12:11.417
Right. So now they
bring in a drill ship,

12:11.420 --> 12:14.787
and they start poking holes
to confirm the deposits.

12:14.790 --> 12:16.576
Did they say where
this might be happening?

12:16.580 --> 12:18.116
Just off the coast here.

12:20.420 --> 12:23.241
If they find oil down there,
none of this is gonna stop.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.286
The mapping, the drilling.

12:25.290 --> 12:26.746
Might have more
than a few beached whales
on your hands.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.957
The ecosystem
can't handle it.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.450
It'll collapse.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.371
These assholes _
can't get away With It.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.415
So let's get this out there.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.409
Once my segment's ready,

12:34.420 --> 12:35.614
you do
an on-camera with me.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.417
Of course.
Whatever it takes.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.741
Did you happen to catch

12:39.750 --> 12:42.457
when the drill ship
is being brought in?

12:42.460 --> 12:44.030
IfI had to guess,
any day now.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.495
Here is mother.

13:15.460 --> 13:16.996
No.

13:26.790 --> 13:28.030
There was a fight.

13:30.380 --> 13:32.075
Your mother was hurt.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.575
Who hurt mother?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.576
A human.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.786
Human?

13:42.460 --> 13:45.202
-Human_?!
-It was accndent.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.496
Not all humans are bad.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.910
Not all humans kill.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.036
You! Human!

13:51.040 --> 13:52.496
[hisses]

14:04.460 --> 14:06.530
When we were at
the Marine Research Center,

14:06.540 --> 14:07.666
that guy came by.

14:09.210 --> 14:13.749
Did you understand
what he was telling me?

14:13.750 --> 14:15.115
[knock on door]

14:15.120 --> 14:16.576
[Xander] Ben?

14:16.580 --> 14:18.411
-[knocking]
-Shit.

14:18.420 --> 14:21.116
-[Xander] Hey, man, you here?
-Get back. Not a sound, okay?

14:23.460 --> 14:25.200
Hey, Xan, what's up?

14:25.210 --> 14:26.199
Hey.

14:26.210 --> 14:27.871
We need to talk.

14:27.880 --> 14:29.996
All right, let's, uh...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.661
Let's go down
to The Anchor,

14:31.670 --> 14:33.570
grab a bite to eat.
I'm starving.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.377
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

14:35.380 --> 14:36.665
All right.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.660
Aw, damn.

14:50.670 --> 14:53.537
Uh, my phone.
I'll be right back.

14:55.880 --> 14:56.915
[hisses]

14:59.960 --> 15:01.700
Yes. Xander.

15:02.710 --> 15:03.916
The man you killed,

15:03.920 --> 15:06.161
that was Xander's father.

15:06.170 --> 15:10.664
Now, that is
why I need you
to stay inside here.

15:10.670 --> 15:13.286
If you go out
and Xander sees you,

15:13.290 --> 15:14.917
bad things will happen.

15:16.420 --> 15:18.376
Tell me you understand
what I'm saying.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.609
Yes.

15:24.540 --> 15:25.746
I stay.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.206
Okay. I'll be back.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.608
[rock music playing
inside The Anchor]

15:31.620 --> 15:33.247
Nobody's home...

15:33.250 --> 15:36.458
Yesterday, when you
stopped by the boat,

15:36.460 --> 15:38.371
I was hiding something.

15:39.500 --> 15:40.706
Someone.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.570
I found one of them,

15:43.580 --> 15:46.071
the one that was there
the night of the street fight?

15:46.080 --> 15:48.378
She was dying
in the middle of the road,

15:48.380 --> 15:50.917
so I took her back
to The North Star--

15:50.920 --> 15:54.162
Xanden
she is dangerous, man.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.410
You gotta be careful.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.877
I know.
She's crazy, for sure.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.245
I mean, I started
calling her Katrina,

15:59.250 --> 16:00.786
with the hurricane?

16:00.790 --> 16:02.075
Yeah.

16:02.080 --> 16:04.321
She says that none of them
want to be here.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.036
I mean, they want to go back.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.200
I want to help
make that happen.

16:07.210 --> 16:08.450
They can't go back,

16:08.460 --> 16:10.610
not with the noise pollution
out there.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.700
And it's only getting worse.

16:11.710 --> 16:12.825
What do you mean?

16:12.830 --> 16:14.411
They found oil.

16:14.420 --> 16:15.876
They're bringing in
a drill ship.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.324
It's all ramping up.

16:17.330 --> 16:19.161
What's that gonna do
to our fishing lanes?

16:19.170 --> 16:22.537
Honestly? Five, ten years,
there won't be anything left.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.826
Xanden
we're gonna stop this.

16:24.830 --> 16:27.412
We're gonna
figure it out, Xan,

16:27.420 --> 16:28.614
save our waters.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.111
Mom? I'm back.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.376
Mom?

16:40.670 --> 16:41.659
Mom!

16:45.170 --> 16:47.240
[water running]

16:51.500 --> 16:52.489
[knocking]

16:52.500 --> 16:54.411
-[gasps
-Mom?]

16:54.420 --> 16:55.785
Uh, yeah?

16:58.750 --> 17:00.035
I didn't hear you come in.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.535
Are you okay?

17:04.540 --> 17:05.700
What happened?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.456
I'm sorry.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.075
I was doing good,
I was,

17:12.080 --> 17:14.662
and then I-- I messed up,
and I called him.

17:14.670 --> 17:16.285
Who did you call?

17:16.290 --> 17:17.917
His name is Glen.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.615
-Who is he?
-He's--

17:20.880 --> 17:22.609
He supplies me.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.747
He brought drugs
into this house?

17:24.750 --> 17:26.286
I started
to get really shaky,

17:26.290 --> 17:28.326
and, um, I don't know,

17:28.330 --> 17:31.072
I knew where he was staying,
so I went there for more.

17:40.290 --> 17:41.951
[crying]

17:43.330 --> 17:45.070
All right, gentlemen,

17:45.080 --> 17:46.320
here are your pancakes.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.490
Thanks, babe.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.991
And I'll see you
later tonight?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.161
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

17:52.170 --> 17:55.162
[rock music playing
in background]

17:55.170 --> 17:56.376
"Thanks, babe"?

17:56.380 --> 17:57.745
She's nice.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.878
Okay? We're just
seeing where it goes.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.529
I'm happy for you.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.246
She seems cool.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.376
Yeah.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.611
And it burns, baby,
I'm bad

18:11.620 --> 18:15.909
'Cause it's so good,
good to be bad

18:15.920 --> 18:17.820
Don't blow it now

18:17.830 --> 18:19.821
I don't brag, brag

18:19.830 --> 18:23.493
It's so good, good
to be bad

18:23.500 --> 18:26.822
If it burns, baby,
I'm bad

18:26.830 --> 18:31.073
'Cause it's so good,
good to be bad

18:33.170 --> 18:34.990
[door opens]

18:35.000 --> 18:36.069
[hisses]

18:42.830 --> 18:43.910
The others?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.610
Ryn. [grunts]

18:46.620 --> 18:47.609
[hisses]

18:48.670 --> 18:50.820
I bring together.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.070
To water.

18:53.380 --> 18:55.029
Home.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.319
Come.

19:00.750 --> 19:01.990
[both hissing]

19:05.170 --> 19:06.376
[growling]

19:06.380 --> 19:07.608
[hisses]

19:07.620 --> 19:10.077
The others.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.240
Where?

19:28.960 --> 19:31.747
Lot of people been
installing these lately.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.035
That right?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.452
Yeah. It's--
It's the drugs.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.781
It causes a rise in crime.

19:37.790 --> 19:39.701
We hear about it all.

19:39.710 --> 19:43.328
Locksmiths, we are
the first line of defense.

19:43.330 --> 19:44.740
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.876
You have a break-in?

19:45.880 --> 19:48.110
Break-out, actually.

19:56.170 --> 19:58.240
My house guests
like to wander.

19:59.330 --> 20:00.456
Where are they now?

20:00.460 --> 20:02.109
Upstairs, sleeping.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.701
I shouldn't
have stopped by.

20:05.710 --> 20:07.826
No, no, not at all.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.036
I'm happy you came.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.951
[locksmith] All set.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.110
Nobody's getting in or out,

20:13.120 --> 20:14.610
unless you want 'em to.

20:14.620 --> 20:15.609
[chuckles]

20:16.620 --> 20:18.497
[shivering] Ooh.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.116
I forget every time
what it feels like
to come down.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.917
Thank you.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.876
Perhaps you should
think about that _
next tIme you start usmg.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.616
There are things
that I can't control.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.168
Like your father
going off to Seattle

20:31.170 --> 20:32.910
and leaving me alone.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.571
Mom, you gotta stop
blaming someone else
for your problem.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.610
Have you been cheating on Dad?

20:41.620 --> 20:42.917
No.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.615
I know I'm
a lot of things,

20:45.620 --> 20:47.668
but a cheater
isn't one of them.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.876
Glen was
my dealer up there,

20:50.880 --> 20:52.324
but we were never romantic.

20:52.330 --> 20:54.707
Why did he come
find you here?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.075
Because I called him.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.320
Yesterday.

21:01.670 --> 21:03.410
I know your father
gets back tonight,

21:03.420 --> 21:06.071
and I will
tell him the truth,

21:06.080 --> 21:07.320
that I relapsed.

21:09.670 --> 21:12.070
And no matter what happens,

21:12.080 --> 21:14.116
I promise you,

21:14.120 --> 21:16.452
I will not stop trying
to get better.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.571
You're my proof that
I did one thing right.

21:22.830 --> 21:23.819
[knock on door]

21:25.620 --> 21:27.030
Glen?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.747
He said he had business
in Port Angeles.

21:29.750 --> 21:30.739
Stay here.

21:36.620 --> 21:37.917
Ryn.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.319
Mom, it's my friend!

21:39.330 --> 21:41.036
I'll be right back.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.996
[relieved sigh]

21:43.000 --> 21:44.661
Is everything okay?

21:44.670 --> 21:47.457
I tell sister's daughter
what happen.

21:48.830 --> 21:50.991
That human kill her mother.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.707
No more secret.

21:55.710 --> 21:57.075
What did she say?

21:59.420 --> 22:00.705
She say Ryn...

22:02.500 --> 22:03.615
is human.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.990
[soft hisses]

23:06.000 --> 23:10.824
[screaming]

23:14.960 --> 23:15.949
[door opens]

23:20.040 --> 23:21.701
[clears throat] Hi.

23:21.710 --> 23:25.111
Um, Helen just went
to put some clothes
in the laundry.

23:35.830 --> 23:37.206
That's-- That's mine.

23:44.380 --> 23:45.699
[pills rattling]

23:45.710 --> 23:47.371
Uh, I don't think
you want that.

23:47.380 --> 23:48.574
That's medicine.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.116
Huﬁ?

23:50.120 --> 23:51.997
Yeah, I-- I am.

23:58.750 --> 23:59.819
[Helen] Oh, good.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.700
You're getting acquainted.

24:02.710 --> 24:04.200
Something like that, yeah.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.877
[door opens]

24:09.880 --> 24:12.747
Maddie, aren't you gonna
introduce me to your friend?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.991
Mom, this is Ryn.

24:16.580 --> 24:17.660
Nice to meet you.

24:17.670 --> 24:18.739
I'm Susan.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.200
Hello, Susan.

24:25.920 --> 24:28.616
You girls don't have
to stay out here.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.611
Ryn, do you like tea?

24:30.620 --> 24:32.030
Mom, it's okay.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.416
Tea?

24:36.750 --> 24:38.490
Be careful, it's hot.

24:45.670 --> 24:46.876
Nice tea.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.117
Ryn, do I, uh,
detect an accent?

24:53.540 --> 24:55.201
She's an exchange student.

24:55.210 --> 24:56.450
Oh, okay.

24:56.460 --> 24:57.916
I'm really good at this.

24:57.920 --> 25:01.321
I'm gonna say
somewhere in Europe.

25:02.750 --> 25:03.819
Scandinavia?

25:05.120 --> 25:06.576
Iceland.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.457
More like Finland.

25:08.460 --> 25:10.451
Okay, that's close!

25:17.210 --> 25:18.746
Your face is hurt.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.035
Yes.

25:21.580 --> 25:22.786
I got hurt.

25:23.790 --> 25:24.870
Why?

25:24.880 --> 25:26.279
Mom, you don't have to--

25:26.290 --> 25:28.702
I spent time
with some bad people.

25:28.710 --> 25:30.029
You are bad?

25:31.960 --> 25:34.827
No. She's not bad.

25:36.250 --> 25:37.569
She's good.

25:39.420 --> 25:42.378
I guess you can say
I'm a work in progress.

25:47.170 --> 25:48.489
No.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.876
No.

25:49.880 --> 25:51.780
-No no no no no! No, no!
-What's wrong?

25:51.790 --> 25:53.200
-My ring.
-What?

25:55.420 --> 25:56.876
I like your mother.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.166
Really?

25:59.170 --> 26:02.378
Yes. She love Maddie.

26:04.620 --> 26:05.746
It's not in there.

26:07.170 --> 26:08.990
It must be in his room
at the Siren Song.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.456
I gotta go!
I gotta get my ring!

26:10.460 --> 26:12.701
No way!
He might be there.

26:12.710 --> 26:15.417
He's gone at least
until tomorrow.

26:15.420 --> 26:16.455
I have to get it.

26:16.460 --> 26:17.449
Mom, you can't.

26:17.460 --> 26:18.609
It's my wedding ring.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.416
I'll take you.
Come on.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.826
I go with you.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.786
[engine starts]

27:14.790 --> 27:17.281
[phone buzzing]

27:32.960 --> 27:34.450
[door creaks]

28:01.000 --> 28:02.456
[hisses]

28:02.460 --> 28:03.609
[hisses]

28:07.620 --> 28:08.666
Mother.

28:10.580 --> 28:13.322
Human kill mother.

28:13.330 --> 28:14.991
Yes.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.663
Ryn let human kill.

28:21.790 --> 28:23.075
I go home.

28:24.210 --> 28:25.199
To water.

28:28.250 --> 28:29.820
Come.

28:29.830 --> 28:31.320
No humans.

28:32.710 --> 28:34.371
No Ryn.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.495
[hisses]

29:04.710 --> 29:05.745
[knocks]

29:07.000 --> 29:08.410
What'd your mother do now?

29:08.420 --> 29:10.240
Nothing.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.911
Oh, now you got me
really worried.

29:11.920 --> 29:14.115
Yeah.
You heard about Klesco,

29:14.120 --> 29:16.418
how they've been mapping
the area for oil deposits?

29:16.420 --> 29:17.876
Sure.

29:17.880 --> 29:19.666
They're gonna be
moving in a drill ship

29:19.670 --> 29:21.820
just off Thompson Seamount.

29:21.830 --> 29:22.876
Hmm.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.529
Where'd you hear that?

29:27.040 --> 29:28.917
A reporter
reached out to me.

29:30.250 --> 29:31.706
This is gonna
destroy our waters.

29:31.710 --> 29:33.166
You know that, right?

29:33.170 --> 29:34.376
Let's not overreact, Ben.

29:34.380 --> 29:35.916
First of all,
these things take time.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.376
Nothing's going
to happen overnight.

29:37.380 --> 29:40.167
If they were just mapping,
you might be right.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.239
But they're not.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.377
They found oil, Dad.

29:43.380 --> 29:44.870
Do you get that?

29:44.880 --> 29:47.075
They're not going away.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.707
What do you want me
to do about it?

29:48.710 --> 29:51.827
Form a coalition,
local business owners.

29:51.830 --> 29:53.377
Put some pressure on them.

29:53.380 --> 29:55.496
Because, you know,
we can't stop progress.

29:55.500 --> 29:57.707
This is not progress.

30:00.170 --> 30:01.660
You got
a good heart, Ben.

30:03.420 --> 30:05.490
I wish we were
all more like you.

30:07.710 --> 30:09.746
I'll make a few calls,
see what I can do.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.450
Thanks, Dad.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.570
They know about art?

30:18.580 --> 30:20.571
Oh, they know
about a lot of things.

30:20.580 --> 30:23.572
[laughs] Civilized,
in their own way.

30:25.210 --> 30:27.280
There's something
I have to tell you, Helen.

30:29.420 --> 30:31.490
When we first met,

30:31.500 --> 30:33.411
you asked me ifI had
any living relatives.

30:33.420 --> 30:34.739
I said no.

30:35.750 --> 30:36.785
Yeah?

30:39.210 --> 30:41.997
This is my sister. Beth.

30:45.580 --> 30:46.740
She's like us?

30:48.250 --> 30:51.242
I'd always assumed
I was the only one,

30:51.250 --> 30:53.161
but of course
there are more.

30:54.460 --> 30:55.609
Beth isn't like us.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.411
How so?

30:58.420 --> 31:00.035
She's got a perfect life.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.611
Husband, kids, nice house.

31:04.120 --> 31:08.033
I didn't fit into that,
obviously.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.326
We got into fights,

31:10.330 --> 31:14.164
and, uh, she said
that I was a danger to her.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.162
She had me committed
to a state hospital.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.286
[deep breath]

31:20.290 --> 31:23.532
After that,
she refused to see me.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.246
Like I don't exist.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.779
I'm so sorry.

31:30.080 --> 31:32.958
Maybe if you
told her the truth,

31:34.250 --> 31:35.615
she'd understand.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.872
Maybe your sister
has been struggling

31:39.880 --> 31:42.872
on the inside
the same as you.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.951
-What, a camera?
-Yeah.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.110
I want to see _
what we're really up against.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.530
What, the oil boat?

31:51.540 --> 31:53.246
No, they're dragging
a sonic cannon

31:53.250 --> 31:54.911
through the water for mapping.

31:54.920 --> 31:56.160
Right.

31:56.170 --> 31:57.990
So, what's my job?

32:00.040 --> 32:02.611
You get me close,
then you wait.

32:02.620 --> 32:03.746
Uh, what if they spot me?

32:03.750 --> 32:05.206
Sockeye are running.

32:05.210 --> 32:08.577
Just a wayward trawler
out for an evening catch.

32:08.580 --> 32:10.741
All right.
Dumb fisherman.

32:10.750 --> 32:11.956
Part I was born to play.

32:15.830 --> 32:17.741
[piston airplane engine]

32:27.290 --> 32:28.496
Let's go.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.871
Mom, wait.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.029
Do you have
the room key?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.109
No.

32:46.380 --> 32:48.109
We need to be smart
about this.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.576
I need to get
that ring back.

32:49.580 --> 32:52.538
Mom, you're not gonna
break into a motel room.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.450
All right,
so then what do we do?

32:56.460 --> 32:58.075
I'll figure it out.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.030
What room is it?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.667
Um, 202,

33:02.670 --> 33:04.820
but I don't want you
cleaning up my mess.

33:04.830 --> 33:07.071
I'm not cleaning up
your mess.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.786
I'm helping you.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.109
Big difference.

33:12.040 --> 33:14.873
I find your ring,
you put this behind you,

33:16.040 --> 33:18.201
and we move forward.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.371
Okay. Yes.

33:34.420 --> 33:35.535
Hello?

33:36.920 --> 33:37.955
It's Helen.

33:39.380 --> 33:40.415
Are you here?

33:41.790 --> 33:43.530
We brought you some food.

34:18.920 --> 34:19.989
Ohh...

34:21.040 --> 34:22.371
my God.

34:23.380 --> 34:25.280
You're beautiful.

34:47.750 --> 34:49.820
[rain spattering]

35:13.830 --> 35:15.821
[doorknob rattles]

35:24.250 --> 35:25.706
Where did
you and Maddie meet?

35:26.960 --> 35:27.949
On land.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.496
[chuckles]

35:29.500 --> 35:30.740
I hope so.

35:30.750 --> 35:33.617
I meet Maddie with Ben.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.781
Oh. Okay.

35:35.790 --> 35:37.951
Maddie really seems
to love that Ben.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.997
Yes. Ben is love.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.491
Oh. That's sweet.

35:43.500 --> 35:46.788
I would like to make love
with Ben and Maddie.

35:46.790 --> 35:48.872
Oh.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.108
O...kay.

36:33.080 --> 36:37.323

36:43.880 --> 36:45.529

These are restricted waters.

36:45.540 --> 36:46.825
Clear the area.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.537
Repeat. Clear the lane.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.076
What?!

36:51.080 --> 36:54.459
-C|ear the area!
-No, I can't hear you!

36:54.460 --> 36:56.997
It's a... It's a good night
for sockeye, yeah?!

36:57.000 --> 36:58.456
They're really runnin'!

apart into the wall, but--

37:21.170 --> 37:22.740
as they're coming
out of the turn,

37:22.750 --> 37:24.661
he is leaving him
absolutely no room.

37:24.670 --> 37:26.160
I mean, they are
just screaming tandem.

Um, excuse me?

37:58.120 --> 37:59.997
Yeah.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.492
Somebody threw a bunch
of lounge chairs
into the pool.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.535
Seriously?

38:04.540 --> 38:06.451
Seriously.

38:06.460 --> 38:08.280
I don't get paid enough
for this shit.

38:51.170 --> 38:52.205
Shit.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.956
[door opens]

39:06.960 --> 39:07.949
Who the hell are you?

39:09.210 --> 39:10.950
What're you doing here?

39:15.880 --> 39:17.916
The power of that thing.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.377
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I had no idea
it would be so intense.

39:20.380 --> 39:23.702
It blasted me back, Xander,
like, a hundred feet.

39:23.710 --> 39:26.110
Wow, that's crazy, man.

Hey, there they are.

you should see this.

[conversation inaudible]

40:11.750 --> 40:14.241
Well, I appreciate
you understanding

40:14.250 --> 40:15.319
me needing to get
my mom's ring back.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.570
No problem.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.242
Your mom,
she's very special to me.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.992
I need to get going.
I was just needing to--

40:22.000 --> 40:23.615
Not yet.

40:23.620 --> 40:25.076
Hang out for a bit.

40:25.080 --> 40:27.287
My mom's married
to a sheriff.

40:27.290 --> 40:29.576
Yeah. Where's he?

40:29.580 --> 40:31.241
I don't want any trouble.

40:31.250 --> 40:32.660
No one does.

40:32.670 --> 40:34.035
I was just living my life,

40:34.040 --> 40:35.450
and then, ring,
your mom calls up,

40:35.460 --> 40:37.701
wants to make things right.

40:37.710 --> 40:39.666
She wants to move on
with her life.

40:39.670 --> 40:40.876
