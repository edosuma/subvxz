I am gonna ask Lyndsey

00:03.938 --> 00:05.304
to marry me.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.472
Will you marry me?

00:06.474 --> 00:08.240
Yes, I will marry you!

00:08.242 --> 00:11.043
I was wondering if you'd do me
the honor of being my best man.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.411
What?
What?

00:12.413 --> 00:14.046
Larry, where can
I put this poop?

00:14.048 --> 00:15.581
This is my sister Gretchen.
She just moved here.

00:15.583 --> 00:17.383
Gretchen, this is
Jeff Strongman.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.051
I think the computer
just read his thoughts.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.552
(squealing)
(laughs)

00:20.554 --> 00:22.287
Yes!

00:22.289 --> 00:24.990
The guy I had dinner with
last night offered me

00:24.992 --> 00:26.392
a job in San Francisco.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.893
Where does that leave us?

00:27.895 --> 00:28.994
I have to take this.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.329
I'm sorry, buddy.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.830
I'm here for you.

00:31.832 --> 00:32.798
If you wanted to go with her...

00:32.800 --> 00:34.333
Oh, thank God.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.636
I thought
about what you said

00:37.638 --> 00:39.104
I don't want
to work for Google.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.506
I want to stay and work
with you.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.408
We're gonna do great things
together.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.476

Barry.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.864
Did you break into this house
and kill Walden?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.401
'Cause if you did, just know...

01:09.403 --> 01:12.438
I'm one hell of a roommate.

say I'm his best friend.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.390
Cinnamon French toast;
Walden's favorite.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.858
Walden's allergic to cinnamon.

No, Walden is allergic

01:46.373 --> 01:47.973
Wait, y-you know
what I like, too?

01:47.975 --> 01:49.241
I know a lot of things.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.776
I know that you're sleeping
with Lyndsey,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.377

01:52.379 --> 01:53.979
who thinks
you're Jeff Strongman,

01:53.981 --> 01:56.381
and you just went on a date
with Gretchen, Larry's sister.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.784

the salesgirl at Goodwill said

03:26.406 --> 03:28.607
Why are you going out
with her again?

03:28.609 --> 03:30.943
What do you mean?
I like her, she likes me--

03:30.945 --> 03:32.945
honestly, I can see myself
spending the rest

03:32.947 --> 03:34.880
of Jeff Strongman's life
with her.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.883
Okay, unlike Jeff Strongman,

03:37.885 --> 03:39.885
she is a real person.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.020
With real feelings.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.622
And real... (grunts)

03:45.058 --> 03:47.459
I know, I know. I...
I don't want to hurt her.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.628
If that's the case,
then you need to walk away.

03:49.630 --> 03:50.963
I-I will, I will. You're right.

03:50.965 --> 03:52.965
Right after I have sex with her.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.900
No!

03:54.902 --> 03:57.236
Well, I'm not gonna walk away
<i>while</i> I'm having sex with her.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.870
That would be rude.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.206
Hey, Jeff Strongman
looks good in that hat.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.642
Top of the day to you, too, sir.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.211
Wait, you can tell
when he's not Alan?

04:06.213 --> 04:08.847
Oh, yeah. I mean,
Jeff exudes a quiet confidence,

04:08.849 --> 04:10.048
whereas
Alan just...

04:10.050 --> 04:11.650
exudes.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.387
Is there a shower
I can use?
Uh, oh, yeah.

04:15.389 --> 04:18.123
Uh, Alan's room's
down the hall on the left.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

04:18.125 --> 04:19.491
whoa, whoa.
What about Jenny's?

04:19.493 --> 04:21.126
She's in there with Brooke.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.529
Yeah, I don't think I can go
in there again "by accident."

04:25.999 --> 04:28.333
But-but, uh,
wh-what about your bathroom?

04:28.335 --> 04:31.336
They're all my bathrooms!

04:31.338 --> 04:33.472
Alan's shower.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.473
Great.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.641
Uh...

04:35.643 --> 04:36.975
so, is this
a "pee in the shower"

04:36.977 --> 04:39.411
or "not pee in the shower"
household?

04:39.413 --> 04:41.313
"Not pee in the shower."

04:41.315 --> 04:45.183
So it's a "pee in the shower
and lie about it" household.

04:45.185 --> 04:49.488
And don't touch
my shower porn!

04:49.490 --> 04:51.323
That stuff took a long time
to laminate.

04:51.325 --> 04:55.327
Everything... you...
say... is... weird.

04:55.329 --> 04:58.330
Look, look, I know you're upset
about Barry moving in with us,

04:58.332 --> 04:59.998
but hitting me
with a 25-cent hat

05:00.000 --> 05:01.767
is not gonna solve anything.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.302
He's not moving in.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.237
He's just staying here
for a couple days

05:05.239 --> 05:07.306
while we brainstorm
some new tech ideas.

05:07.308 --> 05:09.641
Oh, Walden,
you're such a pushover.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.910
Somebody else said they were
only gonna stay in the house

05:11.912 --> 05:13.312
for a few days. Remember that?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.781
Oh, believe me,
I remember.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.517
And now, here we are,
four months later,

05:18.519 --> 05:20.919

we can keep it a secret for now.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.105

08:02.816 --> 08:04.349
I told you we wouldn't

08:05.952 --> 08:08.520
Told you we wouldn't
have to pay for it.

Is this all you guys have
been doing the whole day?

08:10.357 --> 08:12.123
No, we spent an hour

08:12.125 --> 08:14.392
trying to find
where you hid your bong.

08:14.394 --> 08:17.662
Which knocked me
into overtime, FYI.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.600
Walden, I am loving it here.

08:21.602 --> 08:25.337

08:46.325 --> 08:48.693
I feel like this is
a trick question.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.995

So I was watching Brooke
and Jenny make out earlier,

08:57.404 --> 08:59.638
and I thought to myself,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.040
what if we filmed lesbians

09:02.042 --> 09:05.210
doing stuff to each other...

09:05.212 --> 09:07.279
and then we put that
on the Internet?

09:09.882 --> 09:12.017
How has no one thought of that?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.585
I know!

09:13.587 --> 09:14.653
You know what?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.187
It's too late for them.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.089
They're a lost cause.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.758
We can hear you.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.595
I will give any
of you... $100.

09:23.597 --> 09:24.596
All you have to do

09:24.598 --> 09:25.997
is come up here
and take it from me.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.066
Later.
Nah, I'm fine.
Nah.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.502
Do you see that?

09:30.504 --> 09:31.703
Don't be them!

09:31.705 --> 09:33.672
I only let
you stay here

09:33.674 --> 09:35.807
for a few days
to help you transition.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.209
Okay, okay.
I got another idea.

09:38.211 --> 09:40.045
Uh... bacon-flavored eggs.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.614
All me and you
got to figure out

09:42.616 --> 09:45.684
is how to make the chicken
and the pig have sex.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.488
Well, maybe you could show 'em

09:59.799 --> 10:01.466
Wait, wait, wait.

10:01.468 --> 10:02.667
I have an idea.

10:02.669 --> 10:04.869
What if you got
the chickens drunk?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.037
Would that work?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.540

18:19.032 --> 18:20.431
We were fooling
around in the kitchen,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.433
and I picked him up
in a moment of passion.

Lyndsey doesn't use the stove

Sweetie, sweetie,
what are you doing?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.750
Don't forget
the little butter packets.
Oh!

Oh.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.023
Doesn't look
like they're thinking

18:46.025 --> 18:47.558
about any of their exes now.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.460
No, it doesn't.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.728
He's thinking
about banging my sister.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.330
I know what he's thinking!
