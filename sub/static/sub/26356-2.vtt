00:10.800 --> 00:13.040
Are you going to behave for me
on this flight?

00:14.200 --> 00:15.720
Yes, you are.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.120
You cheeky little monkey.

00:20.360 --> 00:25.020
You are a cheeky little monkey.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.880
Peter.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.104
Jo, this is Peter,
we went to school together.

00:47.105 --> 00:48.640
- He's a detective.
- I'm so sorry.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.879
You've spoken with the officers?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.280
Yeah.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.519
Dad!

00:56.520 --> 00:58.000
Chlo.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.880
What will they ask us?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.760
Details about what we've done
since we got off the plane.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.479
I'll ask them to put this in the fridge.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.880
We can take it to Mum's.

03:02.153 --> 03:05.300
We were going to
Elizabeth's house for dinner.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.773
You left the cottage around 8:30?

03:09.774 --> 03:12.319
Erm, I think it was around then.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.319
And you said that you parked the
car outside the convenience store.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.959
We just parked outside and then
Alistair went into the shop.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.820
Why did you get out of the car?

03:21.400 --> 03:23.759
I forgot I needed some tampons.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.399
Are you breast-feeding Noah?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.680
Yeah, yeah.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.340
How long were you in the shop for?

03:32.240 --> 03:33.360
Two minutes.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.040
He was just sleeping. I...

03:47.080 --> 03:48.480
I didn't want to wake him up.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.999
I want you to think very carefully
about what you saw when you

03:53.000 --> 03:55.199
came out of the shop.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.500
Was there anything unusual at all?

03:59.200 --> 04:00.720
Any doors open?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.900
No.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.160
No, nothing at all.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.084
Did you see anybody on the street?
Any cars?

04:17.086 --> 04:18.839
No...

04:18.839 --> 04:21.560
I don't-I don't really remember
until the...

04:25.000 --> 04:27.060
Until the boy in the shop came out.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.100
Why did he come out?

04:30.460 --> 04:32.802
ALISTAIR: Hey. Call the police.
Call the police, our baby's gone!

04:32.803 --> 04:34.656
- Call the police!
- Because Alistair was screaming.

04:34.657 --> 04:36.520
Jo, come on!

04:39.469 --> 04:42.519
Have you seen a baby? Have you
seen anyone holding a baby?

04:42.520 --> 04:44.119
Call the police!

04:44.120 --> 04:46.200
HE SCREAMS: Help! Our baby's gone!

05:27.200 --> 05:28.600
Hello, Jo.

05:30.613 --> 05:32.333
I don't have a hairbrush.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.400
I'll get you one.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.234
These flowers have arrived
from friends and neighbours.

05:55.235 --> 05:56.239
LOUD RINGING

05:56.240 --> 05:58.239
VOICE FADES OUT:
Alistair went to the cottage.

05:58.240 --> 05:59.800
He didn't want to wake you.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.160
Can I get you some toast, muesli?

06:07.847 --> 06:10.287
Where's Alistair?
Have they found anything?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.180
Alistair went to the cottage.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.279
He didn't want to disturb you.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.500
No, they haven't found him yet.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.200
Alistair gave me some
sleeping pills last night.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.560
I don't think I've slept
like that since before...

06:34.147 --> 06:38.560
SHE INHALES SHARPLY AND SOBS

06:41.600 --> 06:43.280
He's not here.

06:48.520 --> 06:49.999
OK.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.700
What do I do?

06:52.240 --> 06:54.799
What do I do?

06:54.800 --> 06:56.120
OK.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.399
OK.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.080
Just one step at a time.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.400
Joanna, hi.

07:12.480 --> 07:15.559
We're here to support
you in any way we can.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.159
You can join Alistair at the
cottage when you're ready.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.540
Have you-have you...

07:20.360 --> 07:22.079
Have you found anything?

07:22.080 --> 07:24.400
We'll keep you informed
of any developments.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.220
Jo, I wanted to ask you...

07:32.680 --> 07:34.400
...how well do you know Alexandra?

07:45.560 --> 07:46.999
What? What? What?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.559
Alistair's ex-wife.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.119
Alexandra.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.159
- How well do you know her?
- Sorry.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.919
Erm, no, I don't, not much.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.999
I don't really know her very much.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.980
When was the last time you spoke to her?

07:59.400 --> 08:00.879
A couple of weeks ago.

08:00.880 --> 08:02.479
What did you discuss?

08:02.480 --> 08:03.600
Erm...

08:05.080 --> 08:06.440
...the custody case.

08:07.873 --> 08:11.540
I'm really sorry, what has Alexandra
got to do with Noah?

08:18.513 --> 08:19.873
CAR DOOR SLAMS

08:32.799 --> 08:34.860
- Peter.
- Alex.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.686
This is Detective Lorna Jones.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.399
She's joining me for the investigation.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.279
We're going to have to ask you
some questions.

08:45.280 --> 08:46.879
You understand?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.319
OK.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.279
How long have you lived here?

08:50.280 --> 08:52.140
Oh, all my life.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.500
Peter and I went to school together.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.020
And Alistair, of course.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.599
Where are you from?

08:59.600 --> 09:01.001
Adelaide originally.

09:01.002 --> 09:02.599
Based in Melbourne now.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.200
So, you don't know small towns.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.120
Can we go inside?

09:08.320 --> 09:09.680
Sure.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.360
Is this happening?

09:17.687 --> 09:18.967
Yeah.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.799
I just need to know your movements
from about three o'clock

09:24.800 --> 09:26.559
yesterday onwards.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.786
Sorry. Why?

09:31.200 --> 09:33.279
We're just establishing a time line, OK,

09:33.280 --> 09:36.159
for everyone that's connected to Noah.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.439
Oh, OK.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.980
All right. I did some shopping.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.020
The supermarket.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.719
Bottle shop.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.279
Bought some flowers, those flowers.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.519
Just the local shops or...?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.079
Yeah.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.400
Tea?

09:55.760 --> 09:57.840
Oh, sit down. I'll make you a cup.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.679
I came home. I did some gardening.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.480
I went for a run before dinner.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.040
Who do you run with?

10:11.080 --> 10:12.480
Who do you go running with?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.720
I run alone.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.359
All right, then.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.479
I'll need you to come down
to the station, today,

10:23.480 --> 10:24.759
for a full statement.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.720
Have you found something, Peter?

10:29.040 --> 10:30.360
Thanks, Alex.

10:37.400 --> 10:41.399
Having seduced Alistair and
conducted an affair with him

10:41.400 --> 10:43.559
whilst he was married to someone else,

10:43.560 --> 10:49.119
would you say Joanna Lyndsay
found lying second nature?

10:49.120 --> 10:50.439
No, I wouldn't.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.479
Isn't it true that the
couple's then ten-year-old daughter

10:53.480 --> 10:59.119
found Joanna having sex
with Alistair in her parent's bed?

10:59.120 --> 11:02.359
Yes, but Joanna didn't know then
that Alistair was married.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.999
But she did continue the affair
after she "discovered"

11:06.000 --> 11:07.279
he was married.

11:07.280 --> 11:09.600
Yes, but Alexandra left
almost immediately.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.120
REPORTERS SHOUT

12:42.240 --> 12:44.479
Sweetheart, I know he'll be found.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.960
I just know it.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.460
I forgot my sunglasses.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.519
- Oh, take mine.
- Oh, Junee, it's all right.

12:56.520 --> 12:59.120
- Hers are in here.
- I don't mind. I've got lots of them.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.919
Can you tell the court what Joanna
said about the phone call

13:13.920 --> 13:17.119
she received from Alexandra Grenville?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.889
She said Alexandra was really angry
over the custody case

13:20.890 --> 13:23.119
of her daughter, Chloe.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.400
Go on.

13:26.486 --> 13:28.726
Alexandra asked her if...

13:28.751 --> 13:30.671
now that Joanna was a mother,

13:30.696 --> 13:33.620
how she would feel if someone
took her child away.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.160
Did Joanna see this as a threat?

14:09.680 --> 14:11.119
Can we use the bags?

14:11.120 --> 14:13.980
They've finished up in this room
so you can take all this now.

14:24.473 --> 14:27.233
- I left-I left some things in here.
- Yeah, it's all here.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.239
There, there... Sorry, there's some
washing in the dryer.

14:30.240 --> 14:32.120
Yeah, Noah's clothes, we have those.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.500
Can I get them back?

14:36.360 --> 14:37.980
I'll do my best.

14:38.640 --> 14:41.359
Look, this is all
totally standard procedure, OK?

14:41.360 --> 14:42.580
I know it's rough.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.480
I'll let you pack.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.440
They're just doing their job.

14:52.480 --> 14:53.839
Come on.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.400
Let's pack this and get home.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.080
HE SIGHS

15:26.920 --> 15:28.320
I got your phones back.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.759
Now, we're going to be monitoring
all calls and social media accounts

15:32.760 --> 15:36.079
from here on. You never know who
might try and contact you.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.679
And we'll be listening at all times.

15:38.680 --> 15:42.519
I would advise against
posting anything on social media

15:42.520 --> 15:44.639
or even looking at it.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.079
They're public forums,
they're worse than tabloids.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.519
They can really screw you up.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.559
You know, we've got
a car here to take you home.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.279
You've got my number. If you need
anything, you just call me.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.959
There must be something I can do?

15:55.960 --> 15:58.979
I can't... I can't sit
around here waiting. Please.

15:58.980 --> 16:00.919
I know it's hard, but we're
an experienced team.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.959
You've just got to let us do our job.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.680
OK? Thanks.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.600
All these missed calls.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.080
Take your time.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.000
No-one will be upset if you don't
get back straight away.

16:26.080 --> 16:29.319
Alex, how are you feeling?

16:29.320 --> 16:30.599
How do you know my name?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.588
Have you heard anything
from the police today?

16:32.589 --> 16:33.963
No. Have you?

16:33.988 --> 16:36.759
You and Alistair were childhood
sweethearts, weren't you?

16:36.760 --> 16:39.240
This is your daughter, Chloe, isn't it?

16:57.920 --> 16:59.399
Where is Dad?

16:59.400 --> 17:01.279
Oh, he's working.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.919
Just pop them in there.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.759
Only the things that you love.

17:04.760 --> 17:05.880
Quick sticks!

17:40.279 --> 17:41.479
Hey.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.440
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.879
Wow, they are ferocious out there.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.180
Have you seen how many
shares there have been?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.220
How long will they be out there?

17:59.680 --> 18:01.660
Till we find him, I suppose.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.180
How's Joanna?

18:10.720 --> 18:12.919
Anyone whose had a child taken
away from them is in

18:12.920 --> 18:14.520
a very particular kind of hell.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.239
Having all those
people out there is terrible.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.799
You're like prisoners.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.839
The press is one of our
best assets right now.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.640
I consider them allies.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.919
Are you sure it's all right
if Chloe stays for a while?

18:36.920 --> 18:37.960
Of course.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.199
- Well, call me if you hear anything.
- Sure.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.360
Alex, do you mind putting those in
the freezer for me? Thank you.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.640
OK. I'll go.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.600
I'll walk you out.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.200
This is from your lawyer.

19:30.160 --> 19:33.759
Oh, call me later for a pick up.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.040
OK.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.719
I'm supposed to respond to it in 14 days.

19:45.720 --> 19:46.840
I...

19:48.560 --> 19:51.300
Well, given everything that's happened...

19:52.120 --> 19:55.860
...I wondered if you'd
just like to park this for a bit?

19:57.680 --> 19:59.640
I can't think about this now.

20:01.640 --> 20:05.860
I can't think about anything
except that my son is gone.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.260
Why are you talking about this now?

20:10.720 --> 20:15.639
Alistair, I don't have enough money
to throw away on lawyers.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.200
It's a fair question.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.400
Aren't you a lawyer?

20:22.760 --> 20:25.279
No. No, I'm not.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.719
You may recall I have a law degree,

20:27.720 --> 20:30.559
but spent ten years raising
a daughter and following my husband

20:30.560 --> 20:32.900
around the world
while he built his career.

20:32.901 --> 20:35.200
Yeah. I don't have time for this Alex.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.199
REPORTERS: Alex!

20:42.200 --> 20:43.920
KNOCKING ON DOOR

20:52.240 --> 20:55.999
You're a mother, surely you can
understand exactly how they feel?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.920
Can you just back off?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.600
The police were asking me
about Alexandra this morning.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.840
Did you get some sleep?

21:14.880 --> 21:16.640
There was a moment when I woke up...

21:20.280 --> 21:21.920
...I forgot.

21:23.920 --> 21:26.120
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

21:28.440 --> 21:29.800
Don't hover, Mum.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.559
Oh, sorry.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.320
Didn't want to interrupt.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.519
Your car is a red SUV?

22:00.520 --> 22:01.740
Yep.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.159
And this is the exact route
you ran last night?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.380
Yep.

22:07.480 --> 22:08.840
There you go.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.520
Thank you.

22:12.813 --> 22:15.533
Are you familiar with the
holiday rental on the coast road

22:15.558 --> 22:16.838
called The Cottage?

22:18.859 --> 22:23.659
Yes, and I drove past there,
if that's what you mean,

22:23.684 --> 22:26.639
because it's on the way
to where I was running.

22:26.664 --> 22:30.540
Mrs Wilson, the landlady, says said
she found you inside the house.

22:31.049 --> 22:32.489
She knows you.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.679
I'm sure she knows
most people in this town.

22:34.680 --> 22:37.599
But you went into the house
where Joanna and Alistair were

22:37.600 --> 22:38.960
going to be staying?

22:44.126 --> 22:47.006
I wanted to see where
they were staying. All right?

22:47.031 --> 22:48.900
I wanted to have a sticky beak.

22:50.280 --> 22:54.740
So after you were at the Cottage,
you did some shopping, and then?

22:56.080 --> 22:57.540
And then I went home.

22:57.810 --> 23:02.439
Did some gardening, went for
a run, got some dinner and then...

23:02.440 --> 23:04.760
You went for a run after nine at night?

23:05.760 --> 23:07.279
You often run in the dark?

23:07.280 --> 23:08.759
Yes. I like it.

23:08.760 --> 23:13.199
So between 4PM and 9PM, you were at home,

23:13.200 --> 23:15.319
can anyone verify that?

23:15.320 --> 23:17.999
No, I was alone.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.380
And you didn't go
anywhere else on that night?

23:21.440 --> 23:22.480
No.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.760
Thanks, Alex.
We won't keep you much longer.

24:01.413 --> 24:02.893
Fuck.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.760
This is very covert.

24:28.666 --> 24:32.786
Sorry, mate. You know that we can't
be seen together in a public place.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.680
Not until Noah's found.

24:34.705 --> 24:36.025
Of course.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.760
Can you be seen in public with Alex?

24:42.800 --> 24:44.520
I know you two went out for a while.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.199
Well, that was some time ago.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.599
And I would rather that the
Melbourne team didn't find out

24:50.600 --> 24:52.040
about it, given...

24:58.960 --> 25:00.360
Pete...

25:05.160 --> 25:06.840
...where is he?

25:08.760 --> 25:11.639
Being in the dark, it's doing my head in.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.240
Are there any leads?

25:16.840 --> 25:19.686
What about the red car that I saw?

25:19.687 --> 25:21.539
Yeah, we're following that one through.

25:21.540 --> 25:23.966
That's one of the avenues
we're exploring.

25:23.967 --> 25:26.279
Is there anything we can do?

25:26.280 --> 25:28.640
Did you speak to Jo
about the press conference?

25:32.320 --> 25:33.680
She's so devastated...

25:35.660 --> 25:38.980
...but I'm worried that she comes
across quite cold and detached.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.959
That's right, I forgot,
that's what you do for a living.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.440
Not quite this.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.120
Can I show you something?

25:55.080 --> 25:56.360
It was on your phone.

25:57.933 --> 26:00.813
That's Kirsty,
she's a friend of Joanna's.

26:00.838 --> 26:04.358
The date says that's
when you left Glasgow.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.240
Now, the suit we have,
but that yellow bib...

26:08.480 --> 26:09.880
...we don't have it.

26:11.006 --> 26:14.660
He might've been wearing it
when he was taken.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.540
You can't remember?

26:22.360 --> 26:23.440
No, I can't.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.399
Why would people say such horrible things

26:30.400 --> 26:33.800
about Dad and Joanna, even Mum?

26:34.840 --> 26:36.360
They don't even know them.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.319
Why don't you just turn that thing off?

26:41.320 --> 26:43.360
Just ignore all that rubbish.

26:44.840 --> 26:48.040
There are some idiots saying
all sorts of horrible things.

26:49.706 --> 26:52.226
But someone might say something important

26:52.400 --> 26:55.020
and someone in the world knows.

26:55.560 --> 26:57.540
They know where he is, Nana.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.500
They might be right here, online.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.720
Can I borrow the car?

28:46.200 --> 28:47.420
What?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.360
I need to get out. I won't be long.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.639
I... I don't think that's the best idea.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.480
The press, what if someone sees you?

29:01.680 --> 29:05.760
I'll be fine. I just need some air.

29:08.553 --> 29:11.980
Well, why don't you take Chloe
with you? She knows her way round.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.140
Really, seriously, I'll be fine.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.919
Yeah, well, why don't we all go together?

29:19.920 --> 29:21.460
We'll get an ice cream.

29:22.106 --> 29:23.946
REPORTERS SHOUT

29:54.520 --> 29:56.640
Hey, I've just got to make a phone call.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.240
Does Dad like these?

30:16.040 --> 30:19.280
Anything chocolate.
I'm just going to get some shampoo.

30:49.759 --> 30:51.479
Hi.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.399
Thanks for calling me. I know you
must be in a terrible place.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.919
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.360
I got your e-mail.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.439
There's a lot of press here.

31:02.440 --> 31:06.199
Well, apart from the fact you owe me
a huge favour for the Fossery story,

31:06.200 --> 31:08.800
you know I can and will tell your story.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.000
The way you want it told.

31:13.920 --> 31:17.280
We're going to find Noah
and then there won't be a story.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.520
Well, a story with a happy ending
is still a story.

31:25.640 --> 31:27.599
Put something in writing.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.040
Bye.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.759
Sorry.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.840
This is not how I
imagined us coming home.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.320
It's OK, Dad.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.440
KNOCK ON DOOR

32:15.760 --> 32:17.360
Just got you some towels.

32:18.440 --> 32:20.959
And someone gave me that as a gift

32:20.960 --> 32:22.960
so I just wondered if you wanted to...

32:25.680 --> 32:27.160
Thank you.

32:55.960 --> 32:58.120
SHE SCROLLS THROUGH COMMENTS

33:09.040 --> 33:11.400
MUFFLED VOICES OVERLAP

33:21.680 --> 33:23.959
Why haven't we heard about the
red car that was parked

33:23.960 --> 33:24.964
on Eloura Street?

33:24.965 --> 33:26.784
What about the mother?

33:26.785 --> 33:29.260
Joanna? Cold eyes.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.959
But she's just lost her baby.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.359
Whoever took it, has to be local.

33:32.360 --> 33:34.399
I can't really imagine
what she's going through.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.159
There's something not right about her.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.599
Cold eyes? Lol. Cold heart.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.802
The ex-wife
is in my daughter's book club.

33:40.803 --> 33:44.040
She says all she talks
about is her 'effing ex.

33:44.339 --> 33:46.179
But steal his baby?

33:49.560 --> 33:50.920
Someone did.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.120
HER VOICE ECHOES

35:10.280 --> 35:12.120
FLOORBOARDS CREAK

35:17.280 --> 35:19.320
SCREECHING OUTSIDE

35:49.760 --> 35:51.680
- Have you found him?
- Is your mum home?

35:53.108 --> 35:54.120
Any news?

35:54.145 --> 35:56.260
Alex, I've got a warrant
to search your house.

35:56.920 --> 35:58.300
Really?

35:59.000 --> 36:00.780
- What on earth for?
- Mum?

36:02.360 --> 36:04.000
Let's let them do their job.

36:06.200 --> 36:07.600
Yeah, but why, Mum?

36:11.160 --> 36:14.279
Chloe has to go to summer school.
I'm going to take her down there.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.759
OK. Chloe, do you have a laptop?

36:16.760 --> 36:18.119
Yes.

36:18.120 --> 36:20.559
Yeah, I'm going to need to borrow
that for a day or so,

36:20.560 --> 36:22.120
and your mobile phone.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.960
Are they your only running shoes?

36:33.640 --> 36:35.039
I have two pairs.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.680
The other ones are in my closet.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.600
Great, thank you.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.200
- We really appreciate your help.
- Thanks.

38:53.560 --> 38:55.320
Thanks for your help.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.240
I told the police you thought
you heard someone in the garden.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.080
Al, I think I was half asleep.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.640
I want to show you something.

39:47.440 --> 39:49.760
Now, I've cut together the
news footage of us.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.320
Watch yourself.

39:53.879 --> 39:55.639
No, I...

39:56.000 --> 39:57.280
No, I don't want to.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.600
The tide can turn against us
in an instant, Jo.

40:10.866 --> 40:14.535
What else is there to do except
do everything in our power

40:14.560 --> 40:15.960
to find Noah?

40:18.960 --> 40:20.303
To bring our Noah home.

40:20.304 --> 40:21.959
Al, please.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.240
Jo...

40:24.600 --> 40:26.799
...we are the couple
whose baby's disappeared

40:26.800 --> 40:28.180
off the face of the Earth.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.719
No witnesses.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.100
No ransom.

40:33.073 --> 40:34.313
No body.

40:38.327 --> 40:40.047
We need the public to help us.

40:42.240 --> 40:43.800
To be looking for Noah.

40:47.360 --> 40:50.260
- Why's it so big?
- So you can still read in case you cry.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.360
I hate this.

41:00.993 --> 41:02.833
The world needs to see your pain.

41:02.858 --> 41:07.500
They want to see a good mother
crushed, not a bad mother hiding.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.820
"Good mother crushed."

41:15.046 --> 41:16.486
Am I the victim?

41:20.080 --> 41:22.839
Victim, rescuer, persecutor,
the Karpman Triangle.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.600
Yes, I'm aware of it.

41:25.706 --> 41:29.020
So, Al and I, we slid from
one corner to the next.

41:29.480 --> 41:32.580
When you were in Australia,
where were you on the triangle?

41:33.840 --> 41:35.520
I was the victim.

41:36.920 --> 41:39.460
Alistair was both the
rescuer and the persecutor.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.560
Did you talk about it with him?

41:44.840 --> 41:46.800
We were in no state to get off it then.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.620
How did you get off it, as you say?

41:52.640 --> 41:54.120
Took a while.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.720
I had forgotten that
once I used to be strong.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.000
I learned the hard way.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.719
Whoever has him,
please give him back to us.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.359
You can leave him anonymously
at any hospital or fire station,

42:10.360 --> 42:11.900
anywhere that is safe.

42:15.466 --> 42:18.186
We miss him so much.
We need him home safe.

42:18.211 --> 42:19.731
Please help us find him.

42:21.073 --> 42:22.313
Good.

42:23.840 --> 42:28.759
Good. Now, those, those pauses,
they're there to help you.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.879
If you feel like crying,
you should just cry.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.199
If you need to...
If you need to stop and pause,

42:33.200 --> 42:34.891
you just stop and pause
for as long as you want.

42:34.892 --> 42:37.740
Listen, "We miss him so much".

42:40.160 --> 42:41.600
"We need him home safe".

42:44.600 --> 42:48.780
Take a deep breath,
but don't censor your feelings.

42:50.680 --> 42:53.160
Our baby, Noah, was only four-months old.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.560
He was wearing a blue
grow-suit like this one.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.560
Whoever has him,
please, give him back to us.

43:12.280 --> 43:15.839
You can leave him anonymously
at any hospital or fire station,

43:15.840 --> 43:17.540
anywhere that is safe.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.280
We miss him so much.

43:29.520 --> 43:31.200
We need him home safe.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.519
Please help us find him.

43:34.520 --> 43:35.839
Please help us find him.

43:35.840 --> 43:37.519
REPORTERS SHOUT

43:37.520 --> 43:39.080
I'm sorry.

43:51.520 --> 43:54.380
And before you went to the
fish shop, you went for a jog?

43:56.080 --> 43:57.380
I...

43:58.200 --> 44:00.479
Yeah, well, I jog, I run.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.840
But, yes.

44:04.200 --> 44:07.399
Do you agree that the path marked
on this map is the route

44:07.400 --> 44:08.800
you ran that night?

44:10.160 --> 44:12.319
Yes. This is the route that I took.

44:12.320 --> 44:13.679
You drove your car to that spot?

44:13.680 --> 44:17.420
Why did you drive out there? It
would've been getting pretty dark?

44:17.920 --> 44:20.879
Well, I like to run out there, I guess.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.639
And since Noah has disappeared,
you've continued to run?

44:23.640 --> 44:24.959
That's right.

44:24.960 --> 44:27.919
Have you run past Elizabeth's house?

44:27.920 --> 44:30.119
It's a small town.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.780
I run all over the place.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.880
Having a sticky beak.

44:37.360 --> 44:40.919
Alex, do you know what happened to Noah?

44:40.920 --> 44:42.220
Do you know where he is?

44:42.800 --> 44:44.079
What?

44:44.080 --> 44:45.480
No.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.720
DOOR SHUTS

44:54.680 --> 44:56.199
Hello, sweetie.

44:56.200 --> 44:58.720
- What you doing here?
- Mum texted me to come.

45:05.640 --> 45:08.039
She's with Peter at the...

45:08.040 --> 45:09.600
at the police station.

45:10.540 --> 45:12.060
OK. I'll get another plate.

45:16.752 --> 45:20.439
They searched the house, the car,
they took out the carpet

45:20.440 --> 45:22.240
from the car.

45:24.880 --> 45:28.999
You know what, the police, they have
all sorts of methods and routines

45:29.000 --> 45:30.614
they have to follow in cases like this,

45:30.615 --> 45:32.239
so I wouldn't worry about it.

45:32.240 --> 45:33.760
Is Mum in trouble?

45:35.040 --> 45:36.319
No.

45:36.320 --> 45:38.440
No, I'm sure she's just
helping the police.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.480
Let's talk about Daniel Falcon.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.440
Oh.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.639
Yes. That's...

45:51.640 --> 45:53.160
Daniel Falcon.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.559
That's me.

45:56.560 --> 45:59.320
It's a fake profile. I made it up.

46:00.373 --> 46:03.013
Daniel Falcon only has one friend

46:03.038 --> 46:04.678
and that's Joanna Lyndsay.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.079
Daniel's not very popular.

46:08.080 --> 46:11.279
So you admit to stalking Joanna
Lyndsay online for three years?

46:11.280 --> 46:13.720
No, I wasn't stalking her.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.799
Being curious isn't a crime.

46:17.800 --> 46:20.359
Is it against the law to want
to look at the woman

46:20.360 --> 46:23.799
who took your husband, took your
apartment, your bloody curtains

46:23.800 --> 46:25.900
and made them her own?

46:28.000 --> 46:30.990
Joanna claims that she heard
someone in the back garden

46:30.991 --> 46:35.140
at Elizabeth Robertson's house
this morning at approximately 6AM.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.079
- Was that you?
- No.

46:39.080 --> 46:41.319
6AM? No, that wasn't me.

46:41.320 --> 46:43.039
That's more than curious.

46:43.040 --> 46:44.999
More like stalking.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.680
I was not there.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.840
KNOCK ON DOOR

47:46.880 --> 47:50.860
This is a bootie that was
found in Chloe's bedroom...

47:52.080 --> 47:55.740
...that contains DNA that matches
that of Noah Robertson.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.180
What?

47:58.640 --> 48:00.359
Where did you find these?

48:00.360 --> 48:03.300
Why don't you tell us the truth, Alex?

48:04.880 --> 48:07.279
Alex, the night Noah Robertson
went missing,

48:07.280 --> 48:09.919
you were sighted outside both The Cottage

48:09.920 --> 48:12.039
and Elizabeth Robertson's house,

48:12.040 --> 48:14.799
you've admitted to stalking
Joanna Lyndsay on Facebook,

48:14.800 --> 48:17.559
you were no more than
two streets away from the car

48:17.560 --> 48:19.399
where Noah was taken.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.759
And now baby clothes with
Noah Robertson's DNA have been

48:21.760 --> 48:23.320
found in your home.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.879
Alexandra Grenville, you are under arrest

48:28.880 --> 48:31.182
for the kidnapping of Noah Robertson.

48:31.183 --> 48:33.559
You don't have to say or do anything,

48:33.560 --> 48:36.279
but whatever you say
or do may be used in evidence.

48:36.280 --> 48:37.999
Do you understand this?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.280
Are you joking?

48:43.200 --> 48:44.840
OK, I want a lawyer.

49:00.373 --> 49:01.533
Al?

49:03.120 --> 49:04.680
You asleep?

49:35.920 --> 49:37.640
PHONE RINGS

49:40.360 --> 49:44.100
Jo! I'm sick with worry.
I was about to get on a plane.

49:45.840 --> 49:47.280
Oh, sorry.

49:49.560 --> 49:51.840
Oh, I've wanted to call you
so many times.

49:53.200 --> 49:55.680
Jo, is there any news?
What are the police saying?

50:01.120 --> 50:02.800
Kirsty...

50:07.600 --> 50:09.200
...you know me.

50:11.640 --> 50:13.200
Tell me the truth.

50:17.000 --> 50:18.888
I'm a bad mother, aren't I?

50:18.889 --> 50:20.720
- What?
- I am.

50:22.600 --> 50:24.242
Tell me the truth.

50:24.243 --> 50:27.759
Tell me the truth.
Please tell me the truth.

50:27.760 --> 50:29.140
Jo...

50:29.640 --> 50:33.039
you have done nothing wrong.
Do you hear me?

50:33.040 --> 50:35.288
I left him.

50:35.289 --> 50:37.679
I didn't... I didn't look
after him properly.

50:37.680 --> 50:40.260
Did Alistair tell you were a bad mother?

50:41.320 --> 50:42.720
No, no.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.439
Jo, listen to me, it's...

50:46.440 --> 50:48.540
No, it's fine, I just-I just...

50:49.880 --> 50:51.820
I just wanted to hear your voice.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.840
Jo, it's a terrible thing
that's happened.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.040
But it's not your fault.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.432
I have to go. I have to go.

51:04.433 --> 51:07.639
Oh, yes, it's the middle
of the night there with you.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.599
Erm, go to bed.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.300
Get some sleep. You'll call me tomorrow?
OK. Bye.

51:20.520 --> 51:22.040
You gave me a fright.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.040
Why would you ask her
if you're a bad mother?

51:36.480 --> 51:37.920
I don't know.

51:47.146 --> 51:50.340
There's a photo
of Noah wearing a yellow bib.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.280
But they can't find it.

52:01.800 --> 52:03.360
Does it matter?

52:13.427 --> 52:14.787
I don't know.

52:23.299 --> 52:25.839
It's probably just a misunderstanding.

52:25.840 --> 52:28.639
But Mum didn't do anything!

52:28.640 --> 52:30.400
She didn't do anything!

52:32.720 --> 52:35.239
When can I see her?

52:35.240 --> 52:37.359
I'll take you there
as soon as we can, OK?

52:37.360 --> 52:40.600
CHLOE WAILS

52:51.760 --> 52:53.920
VOICES OVERLAP

52:56.320 --> 52:58.079
Why have they charged her?

52:58.080 --> 52:59.319
HER VOICE ECHOS

52:59.320 --> 53:02.079
VOICES ON SOCIAL MEDIA: I can't
imagine what she's going through.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.999
Imagine if she did take that little boy!

53:04.000 --> 53:06.039
What kind of a sick person does that?!

53:06.040 --> 53:08.239
That baby could be anywhere by now.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.719
Where is he?

53:09.720 --> 53:11.647
The police were down
near the fishing shacks.

53:11.648 --> 53:13.879
Had dogs and the whole shebang.

53:13.880 --> 53:15.274
Did they find a body?

53:15.275 --> 53:17.439
I gave my statement to the cops.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.839
What? What did you see?

53:19.840 --> 53:23.919
I saw a grey car parked on the road
the day the kid went missing.

53:23.920 --> 53:25.799
Did you see the baby?

53:25.800 --> 53:26.910
No.

53:26.911 --> 53:28.096
But it was strange.

53:28.097 --> 53:30.599
You don't see people outside
their cars on that road,

53:30.600 --> 53:33.200
and that couple, they were going
for it hammer and tongs.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.440
Jo?

53:53.160 --> 53:54.520
We need new rules.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.560
I know.

54:24.280 --> 54:25.840
I found it under your pillow.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.640
Sorry, I needed something.

54:32.800 --> 54:34.400
I know.

54:44.000 --> 54:45.840
If we could go back...

54:47.280 --> 54:48.854
...could we have done
anything differently?

54:48.855 --> 54:50.879
We've done the right thing.

54:50.880 --> 54:52.720
The only thing that makes sense.

54:56.260 --> 54:59.740
Alistair, Chloe, Alexandra, they don't...

55:01.920 --> 55:03.839
...they don't deserve this.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.000
We just need to let this play out.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.160
They can't ever find this.

55:11.640 --> 55:13.080
I know.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.360
These cops are smart.

55:18.520 --> 55:20.240
But we're smarter.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.760
I'll just be a minute.

55:57.920 --> 56:01.599
One, two, three,

56:01.600 --> 56:05.319
four, five, six,

56:05.320 --> 56:09.199
seven, eight, nine,

56:09.200 --> 56:13.679
ten, 11, 12,

56:13.680 --> 56:17.359
13, 14, 15,

56:17.360 --> 56:21.159
16, 17, 18,

56:21.160 --> 56:25.079
19, 20, 21,

56:25.080 --> 56:28.479
22, 23, 24,

56:28.480 --> 56:31.439
25, 26, 27,

56:31.440 --> 56:35.119
28, 29, 30,

56:35.120 --> 56:39.679
31, 32, 33,

56:39.680 --> 56:42.759
34, 35, 36,

56:42.760 --> 56:45.959
37, 38, 39,

56:45.960 --> 56:49.479
40, 41, 42,

56:49.480 --> 56:53.799
43, 44, 45,

56:53.800 --> 56:57.439
46, 47, 48,

56:57.440 --> 57:01.079
49, 50, 51,

57:01.080 --> 57:04.599
52, 53, 54,

57:04.600 --> 57:08.199
55, 56, 57,

57:08.200 --> 57:11.585
58, 59, 60.
