WEBVTT

03:08.479 --> 03:10.355
- Save Shelly.
- Huh?

03:10.523 --> 03:12.774
Save Shelly.

03:59.530 --> 04:02.532
Why, who in the world
let Major Briggs loose, Leo?

04:02.992 --> 04:04.576
It couldn't have been you, could it?

04:07.413 --> 04:10.332
No, no. No punishment, Leo.

04:10.541 --> 04:13.543
It's too late for that
to do us any harm.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.422
And I have a new game for you.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.816
Well, here's our contribution
to the Miss Twin Peaks gala buffet.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.025
Mm.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.654
And I fully expect to see one of you
up there in the winner's circle.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.366
- Dream on, Norma.
- Don't be so sure.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.576
This is the biggest day of the year
for us.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.370
And we have to have somebody
up there

04:48.538 --> 04:50.122
who really deserves this title.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.540
Especially this year.

04:51.916 --> 04:54.126
You mean Laura Palmer?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.962
It would be a good day for healing.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.674
I think we need more than a day.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.260
So, Norma, are they gonna
honor you tonight

05:03.428 --> 05:06.722
on your 20th anniversary
of winning Miss Twin Peaks?

05:06.889 --> 05:08.348
Don't remind me.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.310
Come on,
if you entered today, you'd win.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.979
Look at you,
you're already working on the judge.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.816
Well, since you mentioned it...

05:17.984 --> 05:19.651
Who are you gonna vote for?

05:19.819 --> 05:22.321
Maybe you could split your vote.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.709
- Hi, Daddy.
- Audrey.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.837
The most intelligent face
that I've seen all day.

05:39.922 --> 05:43.508
You make the rest of us
look like primates.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.218
What's with all the books?

05:45.386 --> 05:48.347
Ah, yes, the Koran,

05:48.723 --> 05:51.433
the Bhagavad-Gita, the Talmud,

05:51.601 --> 05:54.686
the Bible, Old and New Testaments,

05:55.021 --> 05:56.730
the Tao Te Ching.

05:56.898 --> 06:02.527
Audrey, I hold in my hands
those holy books

06:02.695 --> 06:04.863
which constitute
the fundamental framework

06:05.031 --> 06:07.532
of humanity's
philosophy of good.

06:07.700 --> 06:12.120
Somewhere in here
are the answers that I seek.

06:12.288 --> 06:17.959
And I intend to read them
from cover to cover, until I find...

06:18.503 --> 06:19.544
Aw.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.215
Listen to me prattling on.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.134
It's Jack, isn't it?

06:27.261 --> 06:29.888
It's only been a day.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.392
I hope it doesn't hurt this much
in a week.

06:34.560 --> 06:39.940
Honey, may I give you
a piece of ageless wisdom

06:40.108 --> 06:43.193
culled from these volumes?

06:43.486 --> 06:46.696
Time heals all wounds.

06:47.698 --> 06:50.117
I know how it feels.

06:50.284 --> 06:52.077
Believe me.

06:52.995 --> 06:56.706
We barely had time
to know each other.

06:57.333 --> 07:01.753
But the time that you had
was highly concentrated.

07:03.131 --> 07:06.216
It's the concentrate
they make concentrate from.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.764
I'm afraid I'll never see him again.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.600
Jack is a man of his word.

07:15.768 --> 07:20.105
And if he said that he'd be back,
then he will be back.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.858
I promise you.

07:23.025 --> 07:27.362
Daddy, you can't promise me,
but thanks for wanting to.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.825
I actually came here
to update you on my trip to Seattle.

07:32.368 --> 07:35.537
Right. Update away.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.789
Okay.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.667
The Packards are using
Twin Peaks Savings and Loan

07:40.835 --> 07:43.128
to funnel cash
to the Ghostwood project.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.590
But the bank is keeping
a very low profile.

07:46.757 --> 07:50.093
It seems they don't want
any bad publicity.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.679
Oh, they don't?

07:53.139 --> 07:57.601
Well, bad publicity
is exactly what they're gonna get.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.228
Audrey, have you given
any more thought

08:00.438 --> 08:03.482
to, uh, the Miss Twin Peaks
Pageant?

08:04.817 --> 08:06.776
Daddy...

08:09.530 --> 08:11.156
From the bottom of my heart,

08:11.324 --> 08:14.701
I don't wanna be
the town bathing beauty.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.911
I understand.

08:16.287 --> 08:21.291
But Miss Twin Peaks
is the ultimate local forum.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.543
Audrey.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.590
It would truly be inspirational

08:28.758 --> 08:31.927
to have a winner
with a political sensibility

08:32.136 --> 08:34.429
that extends
beyond makeup strategies

08:34.597 --> 08:39.476
and, uh, recipes for cherry pie, huh?

08:39.644 --> 08:41.728
Now, as you know,

08:41.896 --> 08:45.690
each contestant gives a speech
to the, uh, assembled town.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.736
This year's theme concerns
our immediate environment.

08:49.904 --> 08:53.490
And what we must do to preserve it.

08:53.658 --> 08:56.868
I know there's another way to do this,
Daddy.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.830
Audrey, make the speech.

09:00.998 --> 09:04.084
Help stop Ghostwood.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.129
And take us to a better day.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.221
Has he taken his eyes off it yet?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.223
Not today.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.933
And before you ask,

09:20.101 --> 09:23.603
we still got people out
combing the woods for Major Briggs.

09:23.854 --> 09:27.023
Harry, considering their mutual
connection to Project Blue Book,

09:27.191 --> 09:29.317
I believe that Windom Earle
has targeted the major.

09:29.485 --> 09:32.445
- What for?
- Interesting.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.075
I don't know.

09:37.827 --> 09:41.288
But with your permission,
I'd like to speak out loud.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.457
Windom Earle has been
seeking access to the Black Lodge

09:44.625 --> 09:46.710
as far back as 1965.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.503
This chess game may involve

09:48.713 --> 09:50.880
more pieces
than we've begun to imagine.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.133
Then of course,
there's the mysterious circumstances

09:53.301 --> 09:54.843
surrounding Josie's death
to consider.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.470
What about them?
Consider them how?

09:58.139 --> 10:01.850
When she died... I'm sorry
I didn't mention this before, Harry,

10:02.018 --> 10:04.019
but I had to take into account
your mental state.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.313
What is it?

10:07.607 --> 10:09.399
She was trembling with fear.

10:09.567 --> 10:12.861
I would go as far as to say
quaking like an animal.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.489
I might venture a guess to say
that it was the fear that killed her.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.199
At the moment of her death...

10:19.535 --> 10:21.703
...I saw Bob.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.040
As if he had slipped in
through some crevice in time.

10:25.207 --> 10:27.083
Upon reflection, I believe
there's a connection

10:27.251 --> 10:29.044
between his appearance
and Josie's fear.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.587
As if he was attracted to it.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.340
Feeding off it somehow.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.260
You see a connection
between Bob and the Black Lodge?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.722
Harry,
I think it's where he comes from.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.933
I think that the Black Lodge
is what you have referred to in the past

10:44.101 --> 10:46.853
as "the evil in these woods."

10:47.521 --> 10:49.272
If Windom Earle is seeking access
to that,

10:49.440 --> 10:52.609
it is imperative that we find our way in
before he does.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.153
There's a source of great power there,
Harry.

10:55.946 --> 10:59.366
Far beyond our ability
to comprehend.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.494
Eureka!

11:03.746 --> 11:07.582
Dale, I could kiss
your pointy little head.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.251
Mwah. Ha, ha.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.962
It's fear.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.256
It's fear, Leo. That's the key.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.134
My favorite emotional state.

11:18.302 --> 11:22.097
And all this time,
it's been staring me right in the kisser.

11:22.264 --> 11:26.017
Leo, it's marvelous, a perfect fit.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.812
These night creatures that hover
on the edge of our nightmares

11:28.979 --> 11:32.232
are drawn to us
when we radiate fear.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.150
It's their bread and butter.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.319
A perfect symbiosis.

11:36.487 --> 11:40.532
Oh, nature,
perfect in design and aspects.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.118
You do not disappoint!

11:43.285 --> 11:45.412
Leo, look lively.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.164
Victory is at hand.

11:48.332 --> 11:52.168
We know where the entrance is.
We know when the lock appears.

11:52.336 --> 11:57.465
Now we hold the key in our hands.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.221
Forgive my hasty departure,
dear one.

12:03.389 --> 12:08.143
The time has come
to gather my beloved queen

12:08.310 --> 12:11.646
and embark
upon our dark honeymoon.

12:12.440 --> 12:17.527
I haven't been this excited
since I punctured Caroline's aorta.

12:18.612 --> 12:23.533
Leo, we must share
a final sentiment.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.078
During our time together
in this verdant bower,

12:27.246 --> 12:32.125
I must confess, I've developed
something of a fondness for you.

12:32.293 --> 12:36.337
Sounding board, companion,

12:36.505 --> 12:39.549
ever obedient and faithful.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.844
An overall A for effort, Leo.

12:43.012 --> 12:47.140
But I'm still a trifle miffed
at your release of Major Briggs.

12:48.517 --> 12:53.396
But then, you'll have plenty of time
to reflect upon that, won't you?

12:56.275 --> 12:58.276
Goodbye, Leo.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.570
And good luck.

13:45.449 --> 13:49.661
One and two and three, step four.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.164
And one and two...
Let the mood carry you.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.708
Don't be afraid of your vulnerability.
Show me more leg.

13:55.876 --> 13:58.753
What kind of a dance
is this supposed to be, Mr. Pinkle?

13:59.797 --> 14:02.465
It's a dance of nature, my friend.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.468
It's a celebration.
All right, girls.

14:05.636 --> 14:09.472
Now, turn around
and bend forward

14:09.640 --> 14:12.350
like a sapling.
A sapling in the wind.

14:12.893 --> 14:17.272
That's it. A little bit more, and hold it.

14:17.648 --> 14:20.942
What exactly are we celebrating
with us all bending over like this?

14:22.319 --> 14:26.072
Don't ever question the vision
of your choreographer!

14:26.490 --> 14:29.200
You are but a petal on my rose.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.912
Now, please, people.
On the count of one.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.166
One and two and three and four.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.793
And one and two

14:39.003 --> 14:42.255
- and three and four...
- I love a chorus line. Ha, ha.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.465
If we could just focus here
for a second.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.509
I've gotta get back to the diner.

14:46.677 --> 14:51.180
Now, what qualities do we think
best exemplify Miss Twin Peaks?

14:51.348 --> 14:55.643
Um, beauty and power.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.645
That's the way I like them.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.941
Poise and, God help us,
a sophistication

15:02.109 --> 15:04.152
and breeding.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.572
Well, I think a major factor
should be originality.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.782
Well, wouldn't that fall under talent?

15:09.950 --> 15:12.160
It's always nice when it does. Ha, ha.

15:12.328 --> 15:16.289
Personally,
I've always been big on style.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.249
I think this is enough
for me to work with,

15:18.417 --> 15:21.502
so I'm gonna go back
and work up the scoresheets,

15:21.670 --> 15:23.630
- and I'll see you tonight.
Mm-hm.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.590
- Terrific.
- Bye.

15:25.799 --> 15:27.467
And three and four.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.844
Okay, that's a break, team.

15:30.012 --> 15:33.097
Hi, Dick. We're on break.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.892
Hi, Lana.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.145
Would you mind helping me
find something in the storage room?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.481
- Storage room?
Mm-hm.

15:41.649 --> 15:44.525
We're missing
a very important prop.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.277
Come on.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.960
I'm having trouble.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.337
Well, just flick it.

16:04.755 --> 16:10.134
Now, what exactly
did you need to find?

16:12.471 --> 16:16.641
- Lana?
- Oh, did I do that?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.644
What are you looking for?

16:19.812 --> 16:24.816
Well, now, I don't know
the exact technical name for it, but...

16:25.859 --> 16:31.614
Does anything...?
Does anything in here look like it?

16:33.701 --> 16:36.911
Oh, I think this might be it.

16:37.079 --> 16:42.041
Oh, by George, I think you've got it.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.304
Diane, it's 1:17 p.m.
I have just concluded

16:55.472 --> 16:57.473
my second meditation of the day
in lieu of sleep.

16:57.641 --> 17:00.935
And I feel completely refreshed
and struck again by the realization

17:01.103 --> 17:03.271
that all of us on this great big
planet Earth

17:03.439 --> 17:05.481
live at only a fraction
of our potential.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.527
We are working round the clock
on the cave petroglyph.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.989
I am certain that the answers lie
in this mysterious etching.

17:13.157 --> 17:14.782
I am also convinced
that Windom Earle

17:14.950 --> 17:17.076
is searching for exactly
the same thing as we are

17:17.244 --> 17:19.454
for diametrically opposite reasons.

17:19.621 --> 17:23.041
If I'm correct in my assumptions
about the power of this unholy place,

17:23.208 --> 17:25.877
God help us if he gets there first.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.004
Diane, at this particular juncture,

17:28.172 --> 17:31.883
I would like to make specific mention
of Annie Blackburn.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.635
She is a completely original
human being.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.347
Her responses,
as pure as those of a child.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.768
I must be honest, I haven't felt this way
about a woman since Caroline.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.228
It has taken meeting Annie
for me to realize

17:44.396 --> 17:47.065
how gray my life has been
since Caroline's death.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.692
How cold and solitary.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.196
Although occasionally,

17:53.363 --> 17:55.490
there is something to be said
for solitude.

18:03.207 --> 18:06.501
Annie Blackburn,
you have almost perfect timing.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.420
That's not
what our choreographer says.

18:11.215 --> 18:12.882
What can I do for you?

18:13.050 --> 18:16.052
Well, I need to, uh, give a speech
in six hours.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.762
I haven't written a word,

18:17.930 --> 18:20.306
and, uh, I don't have any idea
what I wanna say.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.058
I'm in a complete
sweaty-palmed panic,

18:22.226 --> 18:25.019
and I need to talk to someone,
namely you.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.479
What's your topic?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.065
What you can do
to save our local forests.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.235
I just don't wanna stand up there
like some deranged Barbie doll,

18:32.402 --> 18:35.196
saying things like,
"Make sure your campfires are out,

18:35.364 --> 18:36.948
kind of like my brain."

18:37.116 --> 18:40.409
- You're terrified of public speaking.
- Yes. Ha, ha.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.496
All right, well...

18:44.706 --> 18:47.750
...our forests need saving because
of the way people regard them.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.669
Expendable.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.213
If the Ghostwood development
cost thousands of lives,

18:52.381 --> 18:55.258
do you think it would have
a chance of going forward?

18:55.884 --> 18:58.136
Well, trees aren't the same
as people.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.304
But they are alive.

19:01.598 --> 19:05.309
Your forest is beautiful
and peaceful.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.813
Part of it's been damaged.

19:09.189 --> 19:12.441
I've tried to replant,
but nothing's taken root.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.070
Every forest has its shadow.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.658
I can see half my life's history
in your face,

19:20.826 --> 19:23.119
and I'm not sure that I want to.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.297
I don't wanna talk about trees
anymore.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.851
All I know is,
I wanna make love with you.

20:09.541 --> 20:14.837
And this is me with last year's
regional champion from Yakima.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.424
He was cute, but a little slow. Next.

20:20.677 --> 20:23.596
Oh, and this is me
with Brock Farmington,

20:24.056 --> 20:26.265
triple-A champion from Spokane.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.809
Superior upper-body strength,

20:28.977 --> 20:33.272
and quads like bridge supports.

20:33.857 --> 20:37.443
I pinned him in a minute five.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.153
Next.

20:40.948 --> 20:45.409
Oh, this is me
with all the stuff I won.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.330
- That's nice.
- Way to go.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.667
Thank you, Nadine.

20:52.834 --> 20:55.336
Well, ahem, now,

20:55.504 --> 20:59.423
I suppose all of you are wondering
just why we've gathered here today.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.303
See, I learned that, uh, when a couple
is contemplating div...

21:04.471 --> 21:07.139
Uh... Uh... Uh, breaking up,

21:07.307 --> 21:12.645
well, um, uh, sometimes it's easier
to talk about our feelings, uh,

21:12.854 --> 21:14.605
when we're around other people.

21:14.773 --> 21:20.319
So, uh, Nadine,
maybe you'd like to begin.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.154
Okay.

21:22.322 --> 21:25.157
Um, well, I guess it all started

21:25.325 --> 21:29.453
when I noticed Mike's buns
in the hall at school.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.706
Yes, um,

21:32.124 --> 21:34.792
well, how are you feeling now?

21:35.460 --> 21:39.714
Well, a little guilty, I guess.

21:39.881 --> 21:46.262
I mean, Mike and I are hot.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.431
And Miss Twin Peaks is tonight,

21:48.598 --> 21:52.810
and Mr. Pinkle thinks
I'm a show-business natural.

21:53.687 --> 21:58.232
Well, I mean, because I'm so happy,

21:58.400 --> 22:00.609
I worry about Ed being sad.

22:02.195 --> 22:07.491
Ed, is there something
that you'd like to tell Nadine?

22:08.869 --> 22:10.786
Nadine...

22:12.873 --> 22:16.292
...Norma and I
plan on getting married.

22:21.256 --> 22:23.007
Really?

22:24.259 --> 22:27.053
Well, that's wonderful, Eddie,

22:27.220 --> 22:30.514
because Mike and me
are getting married too.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.531
Which way is the castle?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.840
- I waited for you.
- Thanks, Harry.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.925
Not that he's too talkative.

23:48.093 --> 23:51.595
He checks out okay physically.
Doc ran some blood tests.

23:52.973 --> 23:54.515
He's been shot full of haloperidol.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.851
Right.

23:58.353 --> 24:00.104
Garland?

24:00.272 --> 24:02.731
Did Windom Earle do this to you?

24:02.899 --> 24:04.692
Garland?

24:05.735 --> 24:07.778
Odd name.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.573
Judy Garland?

24:11.116 --> 24:12.741
Was it Windom Earle?

24:15.620 --> 24:19.206
It was God, I suppose.

24:19.583 --> 24:22.293
Garland, where did he take you?

24:22.794 --> 24:24.044
The woods?

24:25.046 --> 24:26.380
Can you be more specific?

24:27.799 --> 24:29.925
They were lovely.

24:30.719 --> 24:36.557
Dark. The king of Romania
was unable to attend.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.982
Harry, this is gonna take some time.

24:45.650 --> 24:48.360
- How much time we got?
- Not enough.

24:48.528 --> 24:51.906
Let's leave him here with us.
Maybe something will bubble up.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.912
Harry, we're in trouble.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.955
If the door to the Black Lodge
does exist,

25:00.123 --> 25:02.416
it probably exists at a point in time.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.084
Now, an object, such as a door,

25:04.252 --> 25:06.712
normally exists at a point
in time and space.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.422
By way of contrast,

25:08.590 --> 25:10.966
a shooting star normally exists
at a point in time

25:11.134 --> 25:12.593
over a continuum of space.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.013
But taken from the star's point of view,
it's a completely different experience.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.515
You just lost me.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.935
If we're not at the right place
at exactly the right time,

25:21.102 --> 25:23.103
we won't find our way in.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.147
Sheriff?

25:25.357 --> 25:28.317
Could the Four-H Club
have anything to do with all of this?

25:29.110 --> 25:30.653
Doubtful, Andy.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.077
This has to be the last box.
Look at it.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.162
I can't take any more of this.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.623
Boxes inside boxes.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.125
Whatever is in that
better be worth a fortune.

25:45.502 --> 25:47.753
Maybe it's not a box at all.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.298
Maybe it's just a block
of stainless steel.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.760
- Eckhardt's last little joke.
- It'd be a good one.

25:55.262 --> 25:59.181
Let's channel
some of that high wit into the job.

25:59.975 --> 26:01.183
Again.

26:01.393 --> 26:04.186
I can't believe a little crumb like that

26:04.396 --> 26:08.190
can stand up to
this Cram Jack all-duty vise.

26:08.400 --> 26:13.904
On three. One, two and three!

26:16.032 --> 26:18.659
I'm sorry, Andrew.
That was my fault.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.501
Dumb boxes!

26:35.218 --> 26:36.802
Andrew!

26:45.979 --> 26:48.022
Darn boxes.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.696
Nice shooting, Andrew.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.240
Look at that.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.118
A key!

27:04.039 --> 27:08.959
And where there's a key,
there's a lock.

27:09.544 --> 27:12.087
It should be kept safe.

27:12.505 --> 27:16.550
Yes, in plain sight.

27:16.968 --> 27:20.846
You two don't trust each other?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.682
Of course we do.

27:23.850 --> 27:26.935
Like brother, like sister.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.898
How about here?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.735
In the cake saver.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.738
In plain sight.

27:37.906 --> 27:43.118
- So we have a key.
- Yes, we do.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.965
You look truly beautiful.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.009
Read us your speech.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.013
I'd rather talk about the truth
right now.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.266
What truth is that?

28:06.768 --> 28:09.144
I know something's going on
with you and Benjamin Horne,

28:09.312 --> 28:10.562
and I wanna know what it is.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.065
Donna,
don't talk to your mother like that.

28:13.274 --> 28:16.860
You know, I'm really tired of you
talking to me like I'm a child.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.655
I wanna know what's going on.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.909
Donna, I understand your feeling.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.370
But there are some things
you just have to trust.

28:26.579 --> 28:29.289
You're young
and you don't know all the limitations.

28:29.457 --> 28:31.166
I know the limitations of lying.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.168
I know that you raised me
to tell the truth.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.130
I expect the same from you.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.592
If you're not gonna tell me
what I need to know,

28:40.760 --> 28:42.219
I'll find out from Benjamin Horne.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.555
- No.
- Then tell me.

28:48.560 --> 28:53.939
All right, this is your choice,
not mine.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.024
Donna.

28:57.444 --> 28:58.485
Donna!

29:15.670 --> 29:17.546
By heavens.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.591
Andy, take a look at this.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.426
What you mistook
for the Four-H Club,

29:22.594 --> 29:25.345
the four and the H,
are actually astrological symbols.

29:25.513 --> 29:28.223
- You mean, like planets?
- Why, yes, Andy.

29:28.391 --> 29:30.142
They stand for Jupiter and Saturn.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.144
Some of the others
represent planets as well,

29:32.312 --> 29:36.190
but this particular part of the puzzle
pertains to a precise planetary position.

29:36.357 --> 29:39.651
- Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction.
- What's that supposed to mean?

29:40.069 --> 29:43.071
Well, historically, Harry,
when Jupiter and Saturn are conjunct,

29:43.239 --> 29:45.991
there are enormous shifts
in power and fortune.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.993
Jupiter being expansive
in its influence,

29:48.203 --> 29:49.453
Saturn, contractive.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.624
Conjunction suggests a state
of intensification, concentration.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.002
What this indicates to me
is the potential for explosive change,

29:57.170 --> 29:59.797
- good and bad.
- So when's the next conjunction?

30:00.757 --> 30:02.257
Well, now, let's see.

30:02.425 --> 30:04.510
According to the ephemeris...

30:05.553 --> 30:09.056
...the next conjunction is due
January to June.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.518
My God, Harry.

30:12.685 --> 30:14.019
The door to the lodge.

30:14.187 --> 30:17.064
That's when it's open.
That's what the puzzle is telling us.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.650
It's telling us
when it's gonna be open.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.861
Protect the queen.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.865
If it's telling us when,
then it must also tell us where.

30:27.075 --> 30:31.912
Fear and love open the doors.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.498
What's he saying?

30:34.666 --> 30:39.419
He said,
"Fear and love open the doors."

30:40.380 --> 30:43.507
Two doors, two lodges.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.509
Fear opens one, the black.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.719
- Love, the other.
- What's that mean?

30:47.887 --> 30:49.763
I don't know exactly.
It just came to me.

30:49.973 --> 30:53.141
How does the queen...?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.311
- Of course, the queen.
- Of Romania?

30:56.479 --> 30:59.565
No. The chess game's final piece.
Harry, follow my logic.

30:59.732 --> 31:02.901
- If Windom Earle takes the queen...
- Game's not over till he takes the king.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.571
That depends. Maybe he takes her
to the doorway when it opens.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.823
- Which queen?
- Agent Cooper.

31:08.032 --> 31:09.157
Just a minute, Andy.

31:09.742 --> 31:12.619
The queen. The queen.
The crown. The queen.

31:12.787 --> 31:14.746
- Harry, the queen.
- Agent Cooper?

31:14.956 --> 31:16.206
Andy, please.

31:16.374 --> 31:19.585
Harry, Miss Twin Peaks.

31:19.752 --> 31:22.504
- Holy smokes, that's it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.464
Agent Cooper, please.

31:27.677 --> 31:29.303
Andy.

31:32.932 --> 31:36.935
Coop, the plant's been bugged.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.605
This bonsai isn't from Josie, Harry.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.357
This bonsai's from Windom Earle.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.693
He's way ahead of us,

31:44.861 --> 31:47.237
and we've been working for him
from the beginning.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.489
- What time does that contest start?
- Any minute.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.241
Let's go.

31:51.951 --> 31:54.870
Agent Cooper. Agent Cooper!

33:46.482 --> 33:48.358
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.777
I hope you've had a good weekend.

33:50.987 --> 33:53.655
And welcome
to the Miss Twin Peaks Pageant,

33:53.865 --> 33:57.993
in which one of these lovely
and talented young citizens

33:58.202 --> 34:01.538
will soon be crowned
Miss Twin Peaks.

34:01.706 --> 34:05.625
And now, commencing
our talent section of the show,

34:05.793 --> 34:07.502
Lucy Moran.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.273
Come on.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.119
Small town, man.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.473
So, what,
did you bring your whole family?

35:46.727 --> 35:49.688
We're pulling in deputies from all over
to surround the place.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.189
They should be here any time.

35:51.357 --> 35:54.526
Harry, it is essential whoever wins
this contest receive 24-hour guard,

35:54.694 --> 35:56.444
house security, I want the works.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.988
As soon as she's announced.

35:58.197 --> 36:01.324
Our next entry
is Lana Budding-Milford,

36:01.534 --> 36:04.786
who will perform a dance of, uh...

36:05.246 --> 36:08.582
...contortionistic jazz exotica.

36:08.791 --> 36:11.209
- Lana?
- Agent Coop...

37:13.272 --> 37:16.816
There, my friend, is a real artist.

37:30.623 --> 37:34.251
There is only one way to save a forest,
an idea, or anything of value.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.754
And that is by refusing to stand by
and watch it die.

37:38.422 --> 37:41.591
There is a law of nature,
which is more fundamental to life

37:41.801 --> 37:44.302
than the laws of man.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.180
And when something you care about
is in danger,

37:47.348 --> 37:49.057
you must fight to save it

37:49.600 --> 37:51.810
or lose it forever.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.229
Thank you.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.818
Thank you, Audrey Horne.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.737
Now a brief musical interlude.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.198
Thanks, Daddy.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.409
I'm gonna go out there.

38:16.794 --> 38:20.046
I wanna know what's going on
with you and my mother.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.382
Donna.

38:23.175 --> 38:24.217
Uh...

38:25.553 --> 38:28.096
I, uh, think the wisest course
would be,

38:28.264 --> 38:31.182
first of all, just to get together
and talk about this.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.642
I don't think so.

38:33.686 --> 38:37.397
Donna, I really don't think
this is the time or the place.

38:37.606 --> 38:40.108
Old pictures,
Horne bearer bonds in the attic,

38:40.526 --> 38:42.652
love letters to my mom.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.614
I want to tell the truth.
I want to do the right thing.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.159
A birth certificate
with no father's name on it.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.119
What the hell's going on here,
Mr. Horne?

38:51.537 --> 38:54.289
Why won't anyone tell me the truth?

39:01.964 --> 39:03.548
Donna.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.679
Your mother and I...

39:14.310 --> 39:16.311
You're my father?

39:19.815 --> 39:21.191
Donna.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.651
And to illustrate my point,

39:23.861 --> 39:26.196
I'd like to quote these words
from Chief Seattle,

39:26.364 --> 39:28.615
leader of the Suquamish tribe:

39:28.783 --> 39:31.951
"Your dead are soon forgotten
and never return.

39:32.119 --> 39:35.163
Our dead never forget the beautiful
world that gave them being.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.248
They still love its verdant valleys,

39:37.416 --> 39:40.502
its murmuring rivers,
its majestic mountains.

39:40.669 --> 39:43.421
When the last red man has vanished
from this earth,

39:43.631 --> 39:46.549
these forests and shores
will still hold their spirits."

39:48.094 --> 39:49.677
For the Indians love the earth

39:49.845 --> 39:52.889
as a newborn loves
its mother's heartbeat.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.600
Why have we all lost touch
with this beauty?

39:55.810 --> 39:58.812
Maybe saving a forest starts
with preserving some of the feelings

39:58.979 --> 40:01.022
that die inside us every day.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.316
Those parts of ourselves
that we deny.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.861
For if we cannot respect
that interior land,

40:07.071 --> 40:10.240
then neither can we respect
the land we walk.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.368
So let us, in walking gently
upon the earth,

40:13.536 --> 40:15.495
leave behind a simple legacy.

40:16.205 --> 40:17.997
That we're new warriors,

40:18.457 --> 40:21.626
mystic warriors who love the earth

40:21.794 --> 40:23.336
and tried to save it.

40:24.171 --> 40:26.214
Thank you very much.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.183
Thanks to all our contestants.

40:37.476 --> 40:41.980
Balloting will now commence,
and we will then announce our winner.

40:44.483 --> 40:47.402
Have you both forgotten
what day this is?

40:47.570 --> 40:50.071
Miss Twin Peaks Day?

40:50.281 --> 40:54.659
Today is the day
my unborn child receives a dad.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.911
It was right on the tip of my tongue.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.247
I have decided

40:59.415 --> 41:04.711
that regardless of which individual
is biologically responsible,

41:04.879 --> 41:08.131
that I want Andy to be the father
of my child.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.175
Really?

41:10.342 --> 41:15.013
I'm sorry, Dick, but I just have to do
what's best for little what's-his-name.

41:15.181 --> 41:16.848
Oh, no, not at all. A sound choice.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.684
Heartiest congratulations,
dearest Andrew.

41:19.852 --> 41:24.230
Now, if you'll both excuse me,
I do have a vote to cast myself.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.652
Here's to the children. Ha, ha.

41:31.780 --> 41:34.657
Don't sound so disappointed.

41:35.242 --> 41:36.951
My God, Lucy.

41:37.119 --> 41:41.289
I'm so honored
you made this decision.

41:41.457 --> 41:46.711
And I promise I'll be a great father.

41:46.962 --> 41:50.757
But right now

41:50.925 --> 41:54.177
I've got to find Agent Cooper.

41:58.307 --> 42:00.183
Men.

42:05.773 --> 42:07.899
It is time
to make the announcement.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.445
The winner of the contest

42:12.863 --> 42:15.448
and our new Miss Twin Peaks is...

42:18.118 --> 42:19.869
...Annie Blackburn.

42:36.470 --> 42:40.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
your new Miss Twin Peaks!

42:49.984 --> 42:51.859
This is an outrage.

42:52.027 --> 42:55.697
She's been living in this town
about 15 minutes.

42:56.574 --> 42:57.991
And what the hell got into you?

42:58.993 --> 43:00.410
She gave a beautiful speech.

43:00.619 --> 43:02.120
Inherent in her message were words

43:02.288 --> 43:05.331
even the most craven of us
can ill afford to ignore.

43:24.184 --> 43:25.602
What's happening?

43:34.445 --> 43:38.197
Everybody, please,
please, stay calm.

44:00.262 --> 44:02.347
Good Lord.

44:04.058 --> 44:05.892
This way.

44:29.249 --> 44:33.836
Settle down. Everybody
settle down. Don't panic! This way.

44:36.465 --> 44:38.758
- I will help you.
- Aah!

44:47.184 --> 44:49.143
Annie?

44:51.980 --> 44:56.901
Annie?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.820
- Harry.
- What?

44:58.987 --> 45:00.405
- He took Annie.
- What?

45:00.572 --> 45:02.156
He got Annie.

45:02.324 --> 45:05.702
Bastard. He won't get half a mile
from here. We'll get him.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.414
Agent Cooper,
I've been looking all over for you.

45:10.332 --> 45:12.667
Andy, they're gonna need you
outside.

45:12.835 --> 45:14.085
This is important.

45:14.294 --> 45:17.505
That cave painting in the office,
I finally figured it out.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.800
- What?
- I knew I'd seen it someplace before.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.635
I know where it's telling us to go.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.554
It's not a puzzle at all.

45:24.722 --> 46:23.029
It's a map.
