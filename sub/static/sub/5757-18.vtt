WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.272
PREVIOUSLY ON
 PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.305 --> 00:05.373
THE BANK LOAN CAME THROUGH.
IN A LASAGNA BOX?

00:05.406 --> 00:06.674
THIS IS OUR LIFELINE,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.309
AND I WILL PAY IT ALL BACK.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.611
IF THE BANK FINDS OUT
ABOUT YOUR UNAUTHORIZED LOAN,

00:10.644 --> 00:12.213
THAT'S LIKE A FELONY, RIGHT?

00:12.246 --> 00:14.382
IT'S ONLY A FELONY
IF THEY FIND OUT.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.617
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S GOT STUFF THEY WANNA
KEEP FROM THEIR PARENTS.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.152
YOU BUSY NEXT FRIDAY?

00:18.186 --> 00:20.788
JENNA, NO, WAIT, DON'T HANG UP.
DAMN IT!

00:24.592 --> 00:27.561
YOU JUST GOTTA STOP
WORKING ON THESE VIDEOS.
THEY'RE DANGEROUS.

00:27.595 --> 00:31.365
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PEOPLE
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ARE IN THIS TOWN WATCHING ME.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.067
WHAT ARE YOU--
HANNA!

00:33.101 --> 00:35.569
YOU ARE OUT
OF THE PHONE TAP BUSINESS.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.771
EZRA, MEET ME
TONIGHT AT 8:00.

00:37.805 --> 00:41.275
IF YOU COME, IT MEANS THAT
THERE'S STILL A CHANCE FOR US.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.377
I HOOKED UP WITH SOMEONE
WHEN I WAS AWAY.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.745
YOU SAID IT WAS OVER, RIGHT?

00:44.778 --> 00:47.181
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WON'T TAKE NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.816
TRAINING A HORSE IS AN ART.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.718
YOU HAVE TO WORK
WITH THE ANIMAL,

00:50.751 --> 00:53.454
TAKING ALL THE FIGHT OUT IF IT
 UNTIL IT TRULY IS BROKEN.

00:53.487 --> 00:55.656
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
WHEN I'M THROUGH WITH YOU.

00:55.689 --> 00:56.824
WE'RE MOVING BACK TO ROSEWOOD.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.260
WE?
ME, ISABEL, AND KATE.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.828
KATE'S GOING TO BE IN ROSEWOOD?

01:00.861 --> 01:03.297
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SHE DESTROYED THE FLASH DRIVE?

01:03.331 --> 01:04.632
I KEPT A COPY OF THE FILES,

01:04.665 --> 01:05.766
AND I'LL KEEP
WORKING ON THEM, TOO,

01:05.799 --> 01:07.435
IF WE KEEP IT
A SECRET FROM HANNA.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.641
CHECK THIS OUT.
 WHAT IS IT?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.177
IT'S JUST SOME OLD BOX.
 THAT'S WEIRD.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.411
TURN THE VOLUME UP.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.147
CAN YOU MAKE THE VIEW
FULL SCREEN?

01:19.180 --> 01:21.682
MAYBE MAKE IT LIGHTER.
THE PICTURE SEEMS REALLY DARK.

01:21.715 --> 01:24.652
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
I'VE OFFICIALLY
STOPPED TAKING REQUESTS.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.856
CAN YOU GUYS LIKE
BACK UP A LITTLE BIT?

01:28.889 --> 01:31.659
WE'RE NOT EVEN
STANDING THAT CLOSE TO YOU.
REALLY?

01:31.692 --> 01:33.794
THEN HOW DO I KNOW YOU HAD
A CHEESEBURGER FOR LUNCH?

01:37.698 --> 01:41.269
UM, HAVEN'T WE
ALREADY SEEN THIS BEFORE?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.404
YEAH, BUT LOOK HERE.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.339
IT'S THE BOX
JASON GAVE ME OF ALI'S.

01:45.373 --> 01:48.276
I STILL CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S INSIDE OF IT, THOUGH.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.677
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.645
( phone rings )

01:51.679 --> 01:54.348
IT'S HANNA.

01:54.382 --> 01:58.919
WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET
A CLEAR SHOT IF I--

01:58.952 --> 02:00.321
( phone rings )

02:00.354 --> 02:01.655
HANNA.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.426
( sighs )

02:05.459 --> 02:07.561
IF I PLAY IT OUT
FRAME-BY-FRAME--

02:07.595 --> 02:10.330
( phone rings )

02:10.364 --> 02:11.432
( sighs )

02:13.301 --> 02:17.805
UH, I CAN MAYBE
BLOW UP THE IMAGE,
BUT THEN--

02:17.838 --> 02:19.740
( phone rings )

02:19.773 --> 02:21.875
( sighs )

02:21.909 --> 02:25.479
GUESS WE KNOW WHO'S LOW MAN
ON THE TOTEM POLE.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.948
YEAH,
I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.650
HEY, HANNA.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.819
HEY, SPENCER.
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.421
NOT MUCH.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.190
OH, WELL, GREAT.
DO YOU WANNA WATCH A MOVIE?

02:36.224 --> 02:37.591
UH...

02:37.625 --> 02:39.493
OH, COME ON,
 I'LL EVEN WATCH ONE

02:39.527 --> 02:41.229
OF THOSE ARTSY FOREIGN ONES
 YOU LIKE,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.497
WHERE ALL THEY DO
IS STARE OUT WINDOWS.

02:43.531 --> 02:45.233
I'M SORRY, HANNA,
I REALLY CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.601
I'M JUST WITH MY FAMILY.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.504
EMILY! YOU GUYS, SHUT UP!

02:51.872 --> 02:53.607
SORRY, HANNA.
I REALLY HAVE TO GO.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.611
UH, YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
I GET IT.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.848
SAY HI TO YOUR FAMILY FOR ME.

03:03.817 --> 03:04.918
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.654
I'M SORRY, SHE WAS--

03:06.687 --> 03:08.256
HEY!

03:08.289 --> 03:09.357
LADIES.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.762
IS THAT A DRIVER'S LICENSE?

03:14.795 --> 03:15.863
YEAH.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.633
Emily: IS THAT MELISSA?

03:19.667 --> 03:21.902
I DON'T KNOW.
IT COULD BE JENNA.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.637
IT'S JUST
KINDA HARD TO TELL.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.638
HOLD ON.

03:28.309 --> 03:29.710
IT'S ALI.

03:29.743 --> 03:33.581
BUT ALI ALREADY HAD A FAKE I.D.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.284
AND IT DEFINITELY
WASN'T THIS ONE.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.786
WHY WOULD SHE NEED AN I.D.
THAT DIDN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE HER?

03:46.026 --> 03:48.829
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:48.862 --> 03:51.432
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:51.465 --> 03:53.367
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:53.401 --> 03:55.736
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:55.769 --> 03:58.005
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:58.038 --> 04:01.475
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:01.509 --> 04:05.446
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:07.981 --> 04:11.452
GOD, IT'S SO WEIRD
SEEING ALI WITH DARK HAIR.

04:11.485 --> 04:15.956
I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK AT THAT ANYMORE.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.593
SORRY, GUYS, I GOTTA GO.
I'M MEETING UP WITH MAYA,
BUT I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.028
BYE, EM.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.596
BYE.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.934
WAIT, DO YOU
HAVE TO GO, TOO?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.337
I WAS HOPING THAT
YOU COULD SLEEP OVER.

04:29.370 --> 04:32.406
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD
BOTH USE THE COMPANY.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.808
I'D LIKE THAT,
BUT I ALREADY MADE PLANS
WITH HOLDEN.

04:34.842 --> 04:38.412
OH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ONLY GONNA HANG OUT WITH HIM
SO YOU COULD SEE EZRA.

04:38.446 --> 04:43.050
WELL, I WAS, BUT WE ACTUALLY
STARTED TO BECOME FRIENDS.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.486
SO HAVE YOU HEARD FROM EZRA?

04:45.519 --> 04:48.689
NO, I HAVEN'T.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.425
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE NEVER SHOWED UP

04:51.459 --> 04:53.427
AND HE NEVER CALLED YOU.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.962
YEAH.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.531
HOW ABOUT YOU?
HAVE YOU TALKED TO TOBY?

04:57.565 --> 04:59.433
NO.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.436
I DIDN'T SEE
HIS TRUCK OUTSIDE.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.406
NO, I DROVE IT BACK OVER
TO HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

05:05.439 --> 05:11.111
I JUST SAT IN IT
FOR A WHILE AND, UM...

05:11.144 --> 05:13.113
AND I LISTENED TO THE RADIO.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.417
( crying )

05:19.387 --> 05:21.822
I'M SO SORRY.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.426
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE
HOLDING IT TOGETHER.

05:25.459 --> 05:30.063
BELIEVE ME,
I'M NOT AS PUT TOGETHER
AS I SEEM.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.736
OKAY.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.605
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THE TRUTH.

05:37.638 --> 05:41.742
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE REASON
THAT WE'RE LYING TO HANNA.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.677
DID I PUSH US INTO DOING THIS?

05:43.711 --> 05:46.414
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

05:46.447 --> 05:50.984
THERE ARE JUST
CERTAIN SITUATIONS WHERE YOU
HAVE TO LIE TO YOUR FRIENDS,

05:51.018 --> 05:52.786
EVEN IF YOU HATE DOING IT.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.988
YEAH.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.090
( sniffles )

05:57.124 --> 06:00.093
Ezra: ARE YOU OKAY?

06:00.127 --> 06:02.730
Aria: YEAH, I JUST...

06:02.763 --> 06:04.998
I DON'T KNOW.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.035
YOU SEEM
KIND OF DISTRACTED.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.603
I AM.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.575
LOOK, LYING TO MY PARENTS
WAS ONE THING,

06:14.608 --> 06:18.011
BUT LYING TO MY FRIENDS
IS REALLY HARD.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.147
ARIA, I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO LIE TO YOUR FRIENDS.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.883
WELL, IT'S NOT MY FRIENDS
THAT I DON'T TRUST.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.152
IT'S...
OTHER PEOPLE.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.656
I'VE BEEN BURNED BEFORE.

06:28.689 --> 06:33.193
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOUR MOM
WAS WARMING TO THE IDEA OF US
BEING A COUPLE.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.763
SHE'S...THAWING.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.566
( chuckles )
AND YOUR DAD?

06:38.599 --> 06:42.102
HOW FAST DO GLACIERS MELT?

06:42.135 --> 06:43.971
NOT VERY.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.907
THAT'S WHY THEY
CALL IT THE ICE AGE.

06:46.940 --> 06:51.479
WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.746
HMM?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.648
IT JUST MEANS WE HAVE
TO GENERATE MORE HEAT.

06:54.682 --> 06:55.849
( chuckles )

06:58.552 --> 07:04.792
* OH, I WANT YOU

07:04.825 --> 07:07.761
* ONLY YOU

07:10.030 --> 07:11.999
SO ARE YOUR FRIENDS
COMING OVER?

07:12.032 --> 07:15.636
NO. I TOLD YOU.
THEY'RE BEING ANNOYING.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.038
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.608
NEVER MIND.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.046
OKAY, CAN WE TALK ABOUT
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?

07:26.079 --> 07:29.049
KATE IS NOT AN ELEPHANT,
SHE'S A SNAKE,

07:29.082 --> 07:30.684
AND SHE'S GOING
TO MY SCHOOL.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.686
MOM, MY LIFE
IS COMPLETELY RUINED.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.255
IT'S NOT RUINED,
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
AN ADJUSTMENT.

07:35.288 --> 07:39.126
THE ONLY THING SHE'S ADJUSTING
ARE HER PLANS TO TAKE ME DOWN.

07:39.159 --> 07:43.764
I SPOKE TO YOUR DAD AND HE SAID
HE MADE IT CLEAR TO KATE

07:43.797 --> 07:45.098
THAT THERE'LL BE
SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES IF--

07:45.132 --> 07:47.968
OH, PLEASE,
SHE'S NOT GONNA LISTEN TO HIM.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.971
LOOK, HANNA...

07:51.004 --> 07:53.073
I'M NOT EXACTLY
LOOKING FORWARD

07:53.106 --> 07:55.208
TO RUNNING INTO ISABEL
AT THE SUPER MARKET,

07:55.242 --> 07:57.545
BUT IF WE DON'T TAKE
THE HIGH ROAD,

07:57.578 --> 08:01.081
WE'RE GONNA BE THE ONES
WHO END UP LOOKING LIKE TRASH.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.684
SO JUST PROMISE ME
THAT YOU WILL DO

08:03.717 --> 08:06.620
EVERYTHING YOU CAN
TO MAKE KATE FEEL
WELCOME TOMORROW.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.124
FINE. I PROMISE.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.902
HEY, GUYS.
HI.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.837
HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

08:23.871 --> 08:27.074
PRETTY GOOD.
GREAT.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.543
YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS?
CAN YOU HANG TIGHT
FOR JUST A SEC?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.078
I GOTTA GET SOME CASH
OUT OF THE ATM.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.046
OKAY.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.683
I AM SO SORRY.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.251
YOU SURE KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A GUY SWEAT.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.919
NO, I KNOW.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.090
WE TRIED TO TAKE
THIS SHORTCUT,
AND THEN WE ENDED UP--

08:43.123 --> 08:46.594
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
OKAY, SO...DINNER.

08:46.627 --> 08:50.130
YOU HAD THE PASTA WITH PESTO,

08:50.163 --> 08:52.232
AND I HAD LINGUINI
WITH MEAT SAUCE.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.802
OKAY, GREAT.
DID WE GET ANY SIDES?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.737
ARIA, YOUR DAD'S
NOT GONNA ASK
IF WE ORDERED SIDES.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.138
OH, TRUST ME, HE WILL.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.140
MY MOM'S GOT HIM
ON THIS LOW-CHOLESTEROL DIET,

09:00.173 --> 09:03.010
AND HE'S LIVING VICARIOUSLY
THROUGH EVERYONE ELSE'S MEALS.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.178
OKAY, THEN...

09:05.212 --> 09:07.314
UH, GARLIC BREAD?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.582
SURE.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.150
WITH EXTRA BUTTER.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.821
SO ARE WE STILL ON
FOR TOMORROW?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.956
YEAH, SURE.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.058
WHAT?

09:18.091 --> 09:21.294
I JUST REALIZED THAT
THIS WILL BE THE THIRD TIME
WE'VE GONE OUT THIS WEEK.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.763
WHAT ARE PEOPLE
GONNA THINK?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.632
LET'S KEEP 'EM GUESSING.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.640
SO...

09:32.673 --> 09:36.143
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
HAVE FOR DINNER?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.111
( car starts )

09:41.882 --> 09:44.618
SO WHAT'D YOU GUYS
DO LAST NIGHT?

09:44.652 --> 09:46.987
OH, WE STUDIED
FOR A CHEM TEST.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.389
WE WENT
TO SPENCER'S FOR HELP.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.025
SO TODAY IS DOOMSDAY, HUH?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.661
WHY?
DID YOU SEE HER?

09:53.694 --> 09:55.863
HAN, MAYBE KATE
WANTS TO START FRESH.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.731
THE LAST TIME I GAVE HER
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT,

09:57.765 --> 09:59.900
I ENDED UP BLOWING CHUNKS
ON MY CHUNKY HEELS.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.803
OH, MY GOD!
IS THAT HER?

10:02.836 --> 10:04.104
WHAT?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.338
NEVER MIND.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.407
HANNA, COME ON,
YOU NEED TO RELAX.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.177
I WOULD BE IF YOU GUYS
WERE DOING A BETTER JOB
KEEPING A LOOKOUT.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.146
HANNA, I NEVER GOT A GOOD LOOK
AT KATE TO BEGIN WITH.

10:13.180 --> 10:16.049
THE ONLY TIME
I'VE EVER SEEN HER
WAS ACROSS A CROWDED CHURCH.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.921
WHAT IS HANGING OUT
UNDER YOUR SWEATER?
IS THAT A DUDE'S UNDERSHIRT?

10:20.954 --> 10:22.289
MAYBE.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.127
IT'S TOBY'S.

10:32.299 --> 10:37.004
YOU GUYS, DO NOT LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M ONE OF THOSE DOGS
WITH WHEELS FOR LEGS, OKAY?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.739
EM, WHEN IS YOUR MOM COMING?

10:38.772 --> 10:40.941
TOMORROW.
I'M REALLY EXCITED.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.142
HANNA?

10:44.077 --> 10:46.146
KATE.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.450
WELCOME TO ROSEWOOD HIGH.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.052
THANKS.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.221
HI, I'M KATE.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.057
WE HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY MET YET.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.192
HEY, I'M ARIA.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.327
EMILY.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.428
SPENCER.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.799
SO, I GOT MY SCHEDULE,

11:05.833 --> 11:08.936
AND FIRST PERIOD,
I HAVE HISTORY
WITH MR. BAROCAS.

11:08.969 --> 11:12.740
OH, YEAH, MR. BAROCAS.
HE'S EASY. EVERYBODY LIKES HIM.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.713
UM, I CAN SHOW YOU
WHERE IT IS.

11:19.747 --> 11:22.115
I'M ACTUALLY
IN THAT CLASS, TOO.

11:22.149 --> 11:26.419
YEAH, KATE, UM,
HAVE WE ACTUALLY MET BEFORE?

11:27.921 --> 11:30.924
YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE HAVE, AT THE WEDDING.

11:34.127 --> 11:38.131
IT'S NICE
TO HAVE MET YOU ALL. BYE.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.309
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.745
I WOULDN'T HAVE BLAMED YOU
IF YOU DECIDED TO MAKE ME
FEND FOR MYSELF.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.314
( phone beeps )
YEAH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.857
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:03.891 --> 12:06.526
YEAH. OH, YEAH,
IT'S JUST MY MOM,

12:06.559 --> 12:09.162
WONDERING WHAT TIME
I'LL BE HOME FOR DINNER.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.411
SHE WAS SEEING IAN.
MAYBE THEY USED IT
TO GO OUT TOGETHER.

12:24.444 --> 12:28.515
SO MAYBE ALI FOUND A LOOPHOLE,
A WAY TO FLY UNDER "A's" RADAR.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.317
WHAT, BY BEING SOMEONE ELSE?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.285
YEAH, THE BRUNETTE
ON THE I.D.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.925
( loud chatter )

12:37.958 --> 12:39.159
EW.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.961
I WAS NEVER
HIS NUMBER ONE FAN,

12:40.994 --> 12:43.196
BUT I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HIM
NOW THAT HE'S WITH JENNA.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.498
HE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH
GIRLS IN THIS SCHOOL
LIKE THEY'RE KLEENEX.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.501
WHO CARES THAT HE'S A PLAYER?
HE'S "A's" NEW EYES.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.470
IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.206
HE AND JENNA
ARE ALWAYS JUST OUT OF REACH.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.943
IF WE COULD JUST
GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO--

12:55.976 --> 12:58.311
WAIT. WHAT IF ALI WASN'T
TRYING TO GET AWAY?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.180
WHAT IF SHE WAS TRYING
TO GET CLOSER?

13:00.213 --> 13:02.449
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
BY CREATING AN ALTER-EGO

13:02.482 --> 13:04.584
SO SHE COULD GET CLOSE ENOUGH
TO INVESTIGATE,

13:04.617 --> 13:06.086
MAYBE EVEN TO EXPOSE "A."

13:06.119 --> 13:08.455
HEY.
HEY.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.023
WHERE'S THE MONSTER?

13:10.057 --> 13:12.025
WHO?
KATE.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.027
OH, SHE'S AT ORIENTATION,

13:14.061 --> 13:16.063
AND SHE'S BEING
FREAKISHLY NICE TO ME.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.832
SO WHY DO YOU
LOOK LIKE THAT?

13:18.866 --> 13:21.168
DO YOU THINK THAT
CALEB STILL HAS THAT
VIDEO FILE SOMEWHERE?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
BECAUSE "A" THINKS HE DOES.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.908
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:27.941 --> 13:31.979
I GOT A TEXT SAYING TO
CALL OFF MY 'TECHNO-BOY-TOY."

13:32.012 --> 13:34.948
"A" MAYBE JUST
GOT THEIR WIRES CROSSED.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.918
YEAH, MAYBE THEY'RE
JUST LIKE A STEP BEHIND
OR SOMETHING.

13:37.951 --> 13:40.220
SINCE WHEN IS "A"
EVER A STEP BEHIND?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.922
( bell rings )

13:44.491 --> 13:46.927
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.595
UH, WE HAVE CHEM.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.098
UM, WE'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER, OKAY?

13:53.901 --> 13:56.136
LOOK, HANNA, I KNOW
IT'S NOT GREAT TIMING.

13:56.169 --> 14:00.007
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR FAMILY?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.074
WHAT?

14:01.108 --> 14:02.542
SPENCER,
I USED TO BE A MEMBER.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.147
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE PISSED AT ME
FOR DESTROYING THE FLASH DRIVE,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.416
BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST SHUT ME OUT.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.285
I DID THIS TO PROTECT CALEB,

14:12.319 --> 14:14.888
AND I WOULD DO IT
FOR ANY ONE OF YOU IF I COULD.

14:18.992 --> 14:23.363
IT JUST FEELS SO WEIRD
WATCHING THEM ALL CELEBRATE
AND NOT BEING A PART OF IT.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.633
WHAT CAN I DO?
STEAL THEIR SWIMSUITS?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.635
NO, NO, NO,
DRAIN THE POOL.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.103
NO, NO, NO,
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

14:30.137 --> 14:31.638
FILL THEIR
SHAMPOO BOTTLES WITH NAIR.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.640
TALK TO ME.

14:33.673 --> 14:37.344
NO, MAKING THEM BALD
WOULD ACTUALLY GIVE THEM
AN EDGE ON THE COMPETITION.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.980
TRUST ME,
I'VE ALREADY CONSIDERED IT.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.514
WHAT?
I'M KIDDING.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
BUT THANKS FOR OFFERING.

14:45.118 --> 14:49.189
( phone rings )

14:52.292 --> 14:53.693
IT'S MY MOM.

14:53.726 --> 14:57.931
SO...
SHE'S COMING TOMORROW?

14:57.965 --> 15:01.601
YEAH. I'VE BEEN MISSING HER
A LOT LATELY.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.603
DOES SHE STILL HATE ME?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.605
SHE NEVER HATED YOU.

15:05.638 --> 15:09.676
SHE HATED ME LIKING GIRLS,
BUT SHE'S FINE WITH THAT NOW.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.145
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

15:12.179 --> 15:14.147
'CAUSE THE LAST TIME
I YOUR MOM,

15:14.181 --> 15:16.416
SHE WAS GETTING ME HAULED OFF
TO DRUGGIE BOOT-CAMP.

15:16.449 --> 15:19.452
OKAY, SHE DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOUR PARENTS WERE
GONNA SEND YOU THERE.

15:19.486 --> 15:23.690
BESIDES,
SHE'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSON NOW.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.059
I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.009
SO YOU MOVED HERE
FROM BALTIMORE?

15:42.042 --> 15:45.078
YEAH, SO I CAN STILL
GO HOME ON WEEKENDS

15:45.112 --> 15:47.114
AND VISIT MY FRIENDS.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.416
THAT'S NICE.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.719
DO YOU HAVE ANY FAMILY
IN MAINE, BY ANY CHANCE?

15:52.752 --> 15:55.588
NOPE. NO, ALL IN MARYLAND.

15:55.622 --> 16:00.127
HAVE YOU EVER
BEEN TO MAINE?
THE NORTHEAST HARBOR AREA?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.761
NOPE.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.531
( clears throat )

16:04.564 --> 16:09.402
SO, KATE, WILL YOU BE JOINING
ANY CLUBS OR SPORTS TEAMS?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.438
YEAH, I WAS
ACTUALLY THINKING--

16:11.471 --> 16:12.572
DEBATE!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.507
ORCHESTRA.

16:16.543 --> 16:21.281
SORRY, I THOUGHT I MUST'VE
SEEN YOU AT A DEBATE.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.549
( chuckles )

16:22.582 --> 16:24.684
ARE YOU SURE THAT WE
HAVEN'T MET BEFORE?

16:24.717 --> 16:26.453
PRETTY SURE.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.455
SO I'M GONNA HEAD
TO CLASS EARLY

16:28.488 --> 16:30.357
AND INTRODUCE MYSELF
TO THE TEACHER.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.492
I WILL SEE YOU ALL SOON.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.161
All: BYE.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.165
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:38.198 --> 16:40.300
I KNOW HER.
I KNOW I KNOW HER.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.768
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHERE I KNOW HER FROM.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.370
CAN YOU BACK OFF?

16:43.403 --> 16:45.038
I'M NOT GONNA LET HER
COMPLAIN TO MY DAD

16:45.072 --> 16:46.439
THAT MY FRIENDS ARE GIVING HER
THE FOURTH DEGREE.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.275
IT'S THE THIRD DEGREE.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.543
WHATEVER. JUST STOP
GIVING HER DEGREES, OKAY?

17:09.396 --> 17:11.364
SO DID YOU?

17:11.397 --> 17:12.799
MOM!

17:15.535 --> 17:18.371
LOOK HOW GORGEOUS YOU ARE!
I FEEL LIKE I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN AGES!

17:18.405 --> 17:20.772
IT'S ONLY BEEN A COUPLE WEEKS.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.474
ARE YOU GETTING TALLER,
OR AM I JUST GETTING SHORTER?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.211
SHORTER, AND EARLY.

17:24.243 --> 17:26.279
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GETTING IN UNTIL LATER TONIGHT.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.446
I KNOW,
BUT I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.816
CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA?

17:29.849 --> 17:31.451
YES.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.153
AND DON'T EAT IT YET,
BECAUSE I MADE US

17:33.186 --> 17:34.421
AN EARLY RESERVATION
AT THE GRILLE.

17:34.454 --> 17:35.688
HEY, DO YOU WANNA
INVITE THE GIRLS?

17:35.722 --> 17:39.226
I THINK THEY
HAVE PLANS TONIGHT, BUT...

17:39.259 --> 17:41.228
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE
YOU'D LIKE TO INVITE?

17:41.261 --> 17:44.231
SOMEONE SPECIAL?
MAYBE SOMEONE NEW?

17:44.264 --> 17:46.199
IN A WAY.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.436
IT'S MAYA.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.439
WE STARTED SEEING
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.773
IS SHE GOING TO SCHOOL HERE?

17:53.806 --> 17:55.608
NO, RADFORD.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.245
HER FAMILY MOVED TO RADFORD,
SO SHE'S GOING TO SCHOOL THERE.

17:58.278 --> 18:01.781
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER
IF SHE WANTS TO JOIN US
FOR DINNER.

18:01.814 --> 18:05.385
REALLY? I KNOW YOU
WEREN'T CRAZY ABOUT MAYA.

18:05.418 --> 18:08.188
HONEY, THERE WAS A LOT
GOING ON BACK THEN.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.123
I FEEL LIKE I REALLY
NEVER GAVE HER A CHANCE,

18:10.157 --> 18:12.492
AND IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE
ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.395
( both chuckle )

18:20.200 --> 18:21.534
HEY, COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET'S GO.

18:25.738 --> 18:27.274
HANNA, COME ON.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.811
SPENCE, YOU COMING?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.680
UH, YEAH,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS IN THERE.

18:35.515 --> 18:36.583
( sighs )

18:39.652 --> 18:40.720
UGH.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.523
HAVING TROUBLE?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.595
IT'LL COME TO ME.
( chuckles )

18:50.930 --> 18:52.765
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

18:52.799 --> 18:56.636
I CAN REMEMBER
EVERY SINGLE LOCKER COMBINATION
I'VE EVER HAD,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.371
GOING ALL THE WAY
BACK TO MIDDLE SCHOOL.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.474
IMPRESSIVE. ( chuckles )
BUT ULTIMATELY USELESS.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.875
( chuckles )

19:02.909 --> 19:05.178
BUT THAT'S WHY I KNEW
I'D EVENTUALLY GET IT.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.918
SHEKOMEKO HORSE RANCH,

19:11.951 --> 19:14.287
SUMMER OF 2006.

19:14.321 --> 19:17.690
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
MY SISTER MELISSA
WAS A JUNIOR COUNSELOR
THAT YEAR,

19:19.759 --> 19:21.294
AND YOU WERE IN HER BUNK.

19:25.565 --> 19:29.269
FINE. YOU WIN.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.670
WE WENT TO CAMP TOGETHER,

19:30.703 --> 19:31.804
AND, YES, I'M HER.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.706
I'M EXACTLY WHO YOU THINK I AM.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.844
SO WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE?

19:37.877 --> 19:39.846
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:39.879 --> 19:43.450
FOR YOU TO KEEP
THIS TO YOURSELF.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.551
DO YOU WANT MONEY?

19:44.584 --> 19:46.953
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.793
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

19:53.826 --> 19:56.329
MELISSA SENT ME
A BUNK PHOTO THAT YEAR.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.798
SO IF YOU BEING NICE
TO HANNA IS JUST AN ACT,

19:58.831 --> 20:00.667
YOU'D BETTER KEEP IT UP.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.669
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME A BREAK?

20:02.702 --> 20:05.338
BECAUSE JUDGING FROM THE WAY
THAT YOU TREATED HANNA,

20:05.372 --> 20:08.841
EVERYBODY'S GONNA SEE
HOW UGLY YOU ARE
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM ME.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.289
( indistinct chatter )

20:22.322 --> 20:24.857
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH
THE APP, JUST GIVE ME A CALL.
I PUT MY DIGITS IN THERE.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.026
COOL, THANKS.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.728
EMILY.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.862
HI.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.930
HEY.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.765
HEY.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.335
HI, MAYA.
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.769
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.572
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT CLEAN LIVING.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.341
WELL, WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
IT'S WORKING FOR YOU.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.009
THANKS.

20:43.042 --> 20:46.012
I'M JUST GONNA LET HER KNOW
THAT WE'RE READY, OKAY?

20:46.045 --> 20:49.382
SO WHEN DID NOEL BECOME
YOUR PHONE REPAIR GUY?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.951
OH, HE SAW ME STRUGGLING
AND OFFERED TO HELP.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.586
HE'S REALLY SWEET.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.788
NO, HE'S NOT.

20:55.822 --> 20:59.326
BUT HIS SMILE TAKES UP
HALF HIS FACE, SO I SEE
HOW YOU COULD BE CONFUSED.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.827
( chuckles )
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

21:00.860 --> 21:03.029
I THINK OUR TABLE'S READY.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.865
NICE WORK, PAM.
YOU SAY JUMP AND
THEY SAY HOW HIGH, HUH?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.603
( sighs )

21:12.839 --> 21:16.075
OKAY, SO MY DAD SAID THAT
HE'D PICK US UP AT 11:00.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.944
DO YOU WANNA MEET BACK HERE
AT QUARTER TILL?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.078
SOUNDS GOOD.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.413
GREAT.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.382
WELL, HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.516
YOU, TOO.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.617
THANKS.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.761
ACTUALLY, MY PLANS
KINDA GOT CANCELLED.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.364
SO I WAS JUST GONNA WAIT HERE
TILL YOU GOT BACK.
YOU'RE KIDDING.

21:37.397 --> 21:41.067
NO, IT'S FINE, REALLY.
I BROUGHT MAGAZINES.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.403
I JUST DIDN'T
WANNA BAIL ON YOU.
I DIDN'T WANNA BAIL ON YOU.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.638
MY PLANS GOT CANCELLED, TOO.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.874
SERIOUSLY?
( chuckles )

21:47.907 --> 21:49.509
WELL,
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.544
I DON'T KNOW.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.980
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANNA RUIN YOUR NIGHT.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.048
SAME HERE.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.050
( both laugh )

21:58.084 --> 22:01.788
OKAY, WELL, SHOULD I CALL MY DAD
AND HAVE HIM PICK US UP EARLY?

22:01.821 --> 22:06.058
LOOK, SEEING AS WE WERE BOTH
GONNA KILL TIME HERE ANYWAY,

22:06.092 --> 22:08.695
YOU WANNA ORDER A LARGE
TO SPLIT?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.863
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT REALLY--

22:10.897 --> 22:13.633
I'LL EVEN GET HALF PLAIN,
HALF GREEN PEPPERS.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.101
YOUR FAVORITE, RIGHT?

22:16.869 --> 22:20.139
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT YOU
ACTUALLY REMEMBER THAT.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.008
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I REMEMBER?

22:22.041 --> 22:25.878
YOU, UH, USED TO BE
KIND OF A MEAN PLAYER.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.381
STILL GOT THE CHOPS?

22:28.415 --> 22:30.617
I KINDA JUST WANTED
TO SIT AND READ.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.853
OH, SO YOU DON'T.

22:33.886 --> 22:36.022
OKAY, LET'S GO.
YOU'RE ON.

22:36.055 --> 22:37.790
YOU'RE DEAD, BY THE WAY.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.829
SO, MOM, MAYA
JOINED THE JAZZ BAND
AT HER NEW SCHOOL,

22:42.862 --> 22:44.564
AND THEY'RE
REALLY GOOD.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.033
WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.901
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

22:48.935 --> 22:53.039
I HAD A HUGE POSTER
OF MILES DAVIS
RIGHT OVER MY BED.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.807
I ABSOLUTELY
WORSHIPPED THAT MAN.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.744
REALLY?
THAT'S SURPRISING.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.847
REALLY? I MEAN, WHAT KIND
OF MUSIC WOULD YOU THINK
I WOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.649
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

23:02.682 --> 23:06.453
CLASSICAL MUSIC, I GUESS.
SOMETHING VERY SOPHISTICATED.

23:06.486 --> 23:09.522
WELL, I THINK JAZZ
IS SOPHISTICATED.

23:09.556 --> 23:11.057
OH, ME, TOO,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

23:11.090 --> 23:13.993
JAZZ MUSICIANS
ARE ALSO KNOWN FOR...

23:14.026 --> 23:15.462
( inhales deeply )

23:18.130 --> 23:20.833
( chuckles )
SO, UH, MAYA,

23:20.867 --> 23:24.804
DO YOU ENJOY THE PEOPLE
THAT YOU'RE PLAYING WITH
IN YOUR JAZZ BAND?

23:24.837 --> 23:25.938
YEAH, THEY'RE GREAT.

23:25.972 --> 23:32.545
( phone beeps )

23:32.579 --> 23:36.215
( sighs )
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.917
IT'S JUST MY STALKER.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.652
EXCUSE ME.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.522
OH, NOTHING.
I'M JUST KIDDING.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.524
I DATED THIS GUY
AT TRUE NORTH,

23:44.557 --> 23:47.059
AND HE'S HAVING TROUBLE
ACCEPTING THAT IT'S OVER.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.496
BUT IT'S COOL.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.166
WELL, I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.541
MMM. MM-HMM.

24:01.574 --> 24:05.678
( beeps )

24:05.712 --> 24:07.880
WHAT'D YOU PICK?

24:07.914 --> 24:10.149
OOH! THE NOTEBOOK.

24:10.182 --> 24:14.721
UM, I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO WEAN
MYSELF OFF OF THAT ONE.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.255
RIGHT, NO, WE DON'T
HAVE TO WATCH THAT ONE.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.626
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NO, LET'S WATCH IT.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.928
I'M JUST REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CAME OVER.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.531
SO I'M NOT IN THE DOGHOUSE
WITH YOU GUYS ANYMORE?

24:24.564 --> 24:25.765
NO, YOU NEVER WERE.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.233
WELL, GOOD,

24:27.266 --> 24:29.702
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T NEED
TO STRESS OUT ABOUT THAT

24:29.736 --> 24:31.804
ON TOP OF ALL
THIS KATE CRAP.

24:31.838 --> 24:35.207
HANNA, I REALLY DON'T
THINK THAT YOU NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT KATE.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.276
SHE'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT NICE TO YOU, RIGHT?

24:37.309 --> 24:39.546
OH, YEAH, BUT IT'S A TRAP.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.948
DO YOU REMEMBER IN BIO
WE LEARNED ABOUT THOSE ANIMALS

24:41.981 --> 24:44.083
THAT CAN CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE
TO LOOK HARMLESS

24:44.116 --> 24:47.286
AND THEN THEY LULL THEIR PREY
INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY

24:47.319 --> 24:49.255
AND THEN THEY JUST
BITE THEIR HEADS OFF?

24:49.288 --> 24:50.823
THAT'S KATE.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.159
HANNA, DO NOT LOSE SLEEP
OVER THIS GIRL.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.195
NO, IT'S THOSE FISH!
WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?

24:56.228 --> 24:58.898
FANGBLENNIES.
YES.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.667
KATE IS A FANGBLENNY.

25:00.700 --> 25:04.303
NO.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.072
SHE'S A BOIL N' BAGGY.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.942
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT ONE.
IS THAT LIKE A BLOWFISH?

25:09.976 --> 25:14.113
I AM SHOWING YOU THIS
TO PROVE THAT YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.186
DID YOU HEAR ME?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.320
WHAT ARE THOSE?!

25:21.353 --> 25:23.255
THEY'RE BUG BITES.

25:23.289 --> 25:28.294
GOD, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
LAID EGGS ON HER FACE
AND THEN EXPLODED.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.096
UGH. I WANT MORE.

25:32.665 --> 25:35.968
MELISSA SAID EVERYONE
FELT SORRY FOR HER
FOR LIKE A MINUTE,

25:36.002 --> 25:37.704
AND SHE WAS THE ONE
WITH THE SKIN CONDITION,

25:37.737 --> 25:39.939
BUT SHE TREATED EVERYONE ELSE
LIKE LEPERS.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.173
WHAT'S THIS?

25:43.643 --> 25:45.612
UM...

25:45.645 --> 25:47.680
IT'S AN I.D.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.717
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

25:52.018 --> 25:54.053
( sighs )

25:54.086 --> 25:58.057
CALEB CAME OVER
AFTER YOU DESTROYED
THE FLASH DRIVE,

25:58.090 --> 26:02.261
AND HE OFFERED TO HELP US
AS LONG AS WE KEPT IT A SECRET.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.730
FROM ME?

26:03.763 --> 26:06.799
I'M SO SORRY, HANNA.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.868
NO, PLEASE,
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN--

26:08.901 --> 26:10.269
NO, DON'T EVEN TRY
TO APOLOGIZE.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.971
HANNA, NO, COME ON,
STAY AND TALK TO ME.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.840
I AM SUCH AN IDIOT!

26:13.873 --> 26:16.208
THIS WHOLE TIME I'M WORRIED
ABOUT KATE BACKSTABBING ME,

26:16.242 --> 26:18.144
I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
THAT YOU WERE HOLDING A KNIFE.

26:18.177 --> 26:19.979
HANNA. HANNA!

26:32.091 --> 26:33.025
MAYBE. IS THERE A MENU?
NO, THANK YOU. WE'RE FINE.

26:34.827 --> 26:39.699
OKAY. I'M GONNA
GO FIND OUR WAITER
AND GET THE BILL.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.737
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

26:44.771 --> 26:46.773
I THOUGHT WE COULD GET
A BROWNIE TO SPLIT.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.175
STOP.
WHY WERE YOU ACTING LIKE THAT?

26:49.208 --> 26:52.879
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
BEEN FREEZING ME OUT
FOR THE LAST 30 MINUTES.

26:52.912 --> 26:55.281
BECAUSE YOU COMPLETELY
TORPEDOED DINNER.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.415
HOW DO YOU SEE THAT?

26:56.448 --> 26:58.317
YOU KEPT MAKING
JOKES ABOUT WEED.

26:58.350 --> 27:00.653
I MADE ONE JOKE AND--

27:00.687 --> 27:02.789
AND EVERY TIME I TRIED
TO CHANGED THE SUBJECT,

27:02.822 --> 27:04.724
YOU BROUGHT IT
BACK TO TRUE NORTH.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.759
I ASKED YOU TO
START OVER WITH MY MOM.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.427
AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS DOING.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.362
I WAS TRYING TO BE HONEST.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.964
BEING HONEST IS FINE.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.033
YOU WERE TRYING TO GET
A RISE OUT OF HER.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.268
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU BRING UP
DATING THAT GUY?

27:16.302 --> 27:20.072
I FINALLY GOT MY MOM
TO COME ON BOARD
WITH ME DATING GIRLS

27:20.106 --> 27:22.041
AND YOU BRING THAT UP?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.243
IT'S CONFUSING FOR HER.

27:24.276 --> 27:28.414
IS THE FACT THAT I DATED A GUY
CONFUSING FOR YOUR MOM...

27:28.447 --> 27:30.717
OR FOR YOU?

27:30.750 --> 27:32.685
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL SET.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.392
I'M GLAD YOU COULD JOIN US.

27:40.426 --> 27:43.830
THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME.
IT'S AN HONOR.

27:43.863 --> 27:47.834
NO, IT'S A BUNCH
OF BORING OLD FARTS
DISCUSSING DEAD AUTHORS.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.102
BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE
SOME YOUNG BLOOD IN THE MIX.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.906
I'LL ADMIT, I HAVE
AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE
FOR DRAGGING YOU HERE.

27:53.940 --> 27:57.176
I'VE RECOMMENDED YOU FOR
AN ASSOCIATE DEAN'S POSITION

27:57.209 --> 27:59.779
AT THE NEW HOLLIS
SATELLITE SCHOOL.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.348
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
I HAD NO IDEA.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.150
IT'S AN HONOR.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.419
IF THE BOARD APPROVES, AND I
CAN'T SEE WHY THEY WOULDN'T,

28:07.453 --> 28:10.489
YOU WOULD NEED
TO BE IN LOUISIANA BY
THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH.

28:10.522 --> 28:15.361
I ASSUMED THAT
THE EXTENSION PROGRAM
WAS IN PHILADELPHIA.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.229
NO, IT'S IN NEW ORLEANS.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.498
WE'RE PARTICIPATING
IN A GRANT PROGRAM

28:19.531 --> 28:23.335
SET UP
TO REVITALIZE THE CITY.

28:23.369 --> 28:27.239
WELL, I THINK I'LL NEED
A FEW DAYS TO THINK ABOUT IT.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.375
EZRA, I'LL BE CANDID.

28:29.408 --> 28:32.478
YOU WEREN'T ON
THE SHORT-LIST
FOR THIS POSITION.

28:32.511 --> 28:37.049
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
BYRON MONTGOMERY INSISTED
YOU WERE PERFECT FOR THE JOB

28:37.083 --> 28:38.951
THAT I EVEN CONSIDERED IT.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.189
( chuckles )

28:53.365 --> 28:56.035
( sighs )

28:59.005 --> 29:00.973
I DON'T GET IT.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.943
YOU KNEW HOW LONG
IT TOOK ME TO TRUST YOU AGAIN.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.544
WHY WOULD YOU RUIN THAT?

29:05.577 --> 29:07.980
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D FIND OUT.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.249
WOW. WRONG ANSWER.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.085
JUST LET ME FINISH, OKAY?

29:13.119 --> 29:16.088
I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D FIND OUT
UNTIL I SOLVED WHATEVER IT IS
YOU GUYS ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.356
I DON'T NEED THAT.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.859
I NEEDED YOU NOT
TO GO BEHIND MY BACK.

29:19.892 --> 29:22.962
HANNA, I KNOW THAT YOU
WERE TRYING TO PROTECT ME,
BUT I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.797
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
I'M TRYING TO PROTECT, CALEB.

29:27.133 --> 29:32.004
LAST YEAR, IT WAS REALLY BAD
FOR ME AND MY MOM.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.273
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:34.306 --> 29:37.276
NO ONE REALLY
EVEN KNEW BECAUSE...

29:37.309 --> 29:41.013
I WAS STILL
WEARING THE SAME CLOTHES
AND DRIVING THE SAME CAR,

29:41.047 --> 29:43.515
BUT WE WERE
TOTALLY BROKE.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.986
WHAT'S BROKE?

29:47.019 --> 29:49.221
IT MIGHT MEAN SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FOR YOU
THAN IT DOES TO ME.

29:49.255 --> 29:52.558
WE ALMOST LOST OUR HOUSE.

29:55.594 --> 29:58.364
MY MOM GOT MONEY FROM THE BANK
TO TIDE US OVER.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.466
DO YOU STILL NEED--
NO.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.935
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M TELLING YOU.

30:05.171 --> 30:08.407
MY MOM DIDN'T BORROW MONEY
FROM THE BANK.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.243
SHE STOLE IT.

30:14.881 --> 30:17.850
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE THAT,

30:17.884 --> 30:20.352
NOT EVEN MY FRIENDS.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.496
THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING ME.

30:30.529 --> 30:32.932
I PROMISE I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.904
BUT SOMEONE ELSE KNOWS.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.039
AND THEY'RE
HOLDING IT OVER ME.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.141
WHO?

30:43.275 --> 30:44.243
WHO?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.245
IS IT JENNA?

30:46.278 --> 30:49.982
I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS.

30:50.016 --> 30:53.585
BUT IT'S THEIR PHONE
THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.539
OH!
YEAH!

31:13.572 --> 31:18.577
( cheering )

31:18.610 --> 31:21.147
WINNING REALLY BRINGS OUT
THE NERD IN YOU, HUH?

31:21.180 --> 31:24.016
OKAY, I'M GONNA IGNORE
ALL OF YOUR HOSTILITY
RIGHT NOW

31:24.050 --> 31:26.518
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT
COMES FROM A PLACE OF SHAME.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.420
HOW ABOUT SOME SODA?

31:28.454 --> 31:30.089
THAT'S COOL.
I GOT.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.526
( sighs )

31:34.560 --> 31:37.529
SO WHAT HAPPENED
TO THAT THEATRE GUY?

31:37.563 --> 31:40.332
UH, HE COULDN'T
MAKE IT TONIGHT.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.601
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU TWO BEEN, UH...

31:42.634 --> 31:44.236
WE DON'T NEED
TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.704
REMATCH?
MM-HMM.

31:45.737 --> 31:49.108
GONNA MASSACRE YOU AGAIN.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.346
YES!

32:19.738 --> 32:21.140
( siren wails )

32:25.677 --> 32:27.113
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

32:27.146 --> 32:28.714
JUST KNOCKING ON THE DOOR.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.252
WHO WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

32:33.285 --> 32:36.122
JENNA. HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

32:36.155 --> 32:38.290
NO, NOT FOR AWHILE.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.492
WHAT DO YOU
WANNA SEE HER ABOUT?

32:40.526 --> 32:42.261
THAT'S BETWEEN ME AND HER.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.363
WELL, IF YOU'RE LOOKING
TO GET YOUR OLD JOB BACK,

32:44.396 --> 32:46.165
IT'S TOO LATE.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.467
SHE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE.
NO.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.670
ACTUALLY, I CAME BY TO TELL HER
TO STOP THREATENING HANNA
AND HER FRIENDS.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.073
YOU BETTER BE A LOT
SCARIER THAN THAT

32:54.106 --> 32:57.009
IF YOU WANT JENNA
TO TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.049
I'M GONNA GO NOW.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.416
YEAH, YOU DO THAT.

33:12.658 --> 33:16.095
( door shuts, engine starts )

33:20.499 --> 33:22.201
( engine revs, tires screech )

33:26.272 --> 33:29.341
( engine revs )

33:50.329 --> 33:52.498
DON'T SLAM THE DOOR
IN MY FACE.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.367
I WASN'T GOING TO.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.213
WHAT I DID,
IT WASN'T AN ACT OF BETRAYAL.

34:07.246 --> 34:09.415
IT WAS AN ACT
OF DESPERATION.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.317
WE'VE ALL BEEN DESPERATE.

34:11.350 --> 34:12.650
THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.

34:12.684 --> 34:16.388
OKAY, I KNOW.

34:16.422 --> 34:23.295
IT'S JUST THAT "A" HAS TAKEN
EVERYTHING FROM ME.

34:23.329 --> 34:25.597
PLEASE, I CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO.

34:30.168 --> 34:31.237
YOU HAVEN'T.

34:47.453 --> 34:50.889
SO MY DAD JUST TEXTED,
AND HE'S ALMOST HERE.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.391
SORRY, MAN.
( groans )

34:53.425 --> 34:54.826
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:54.860 --> 34:56.395
YEAH, I'M FINE.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.802
WHAT IS THAT FROM?

35:03.835 --> 35:07.573
OH, IT'S NOTHING.
I PLAY TOUCH FOOTBALL.

35:07.606 --> 35:12.578
SO DOES MY LITTLE BROTHER,
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A BRUISE
LIKE THAT ON HIM BEFORE.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.580
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.315
HOLDEN,
THAT'S A SERIOUS BRUISE.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.584
PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.367
I WAS SO STUPID.

35:35.401 --> 35:38.170
I THOUGHT IF WE COULD USE
THE PHONE TO NAIL "A"
ONCE AND FOR ALL,

35:38.204 --> 35:40.572
IT'D BE WORTH THE RISK.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.574
MAKES SENSE.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.210
I DON'T KNOW.

35:44.243 --> 35:47.213
WE GOT NOTHING
FROM THE I.D.

35:47.246 --> 35:49.881
IT WAS A COMPLETE DEAD END.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.750
I'M NOT SO SURE.

35:51.783 --> 35:55.887
I DIDN'T TELL YOU THIS EARLIER
'CAUSE I WAS MAD,

35:55.921 --> 35:58.490
BUT I'VE SEEN ALI
WITH DARK HAIR BEFORE.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.526
YOU HAVE?

36:00.559 --> 36:04.296
YEAH, ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.932
VIVIAN, LISTEN TO ME.
IT'S FIERCE.

36:08.934 --> 36:13.239
CAN YOU PLEASE GET
MISS DARKBLOOM A CUP OF COFFEE?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.907
OH.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.844
IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME HERE,
ISN'T, HONEY?

36:18.877 --> 36:20.412
YEAH.

36:20.446 --> 36:22.248
OKAY.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.250
YOU WANT CREAM
OR SUGAR, VIVIAN?

36:24.283 --> 36:28.320
NO THANKS,
I DON'T LIKE IT SWEET.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.291
ALI?

36:32.324 --> 36:33.925
HANNA?

36:33.959 --> 36:35.394
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

36:35.427 --> 36:38.697
MY MOM MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.999
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAME HERE.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.801
YOUR HAIR LOOKS GREAT.

36:42.834 --> 36:45.237
I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE YOU.

36:45.271 --> 36:48.707
JUST TRYING SOMETHING NEW,
TESTING THE WATERS.

36:51.477 --> 36:53.312
HERE'S THE THING.

36:53.345 --> 36:56.782
I'M PRETENDING
TO BE SOMEONE ELSE,
SO PLAY ALONG.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.384
OKAY...

36:58.417 --> 37:00.352
BUT WHY?

37:00.386 --> 37:03.922
BECAUSE I'M BORED.
I DO IT A LOT.

37:03.955 --> 37:07.726
YOU SHOULD
TRY IT SOME TIME.

37:07.759 --> 37:12.431
I MEAN, AREN'T YOU JUST
SICK AND TIRED OF BEING YOU?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.571
( chuckles )

37:26.345 --> 37:28.314
I GUESS
I NEVER TOLD YOU GUYS BEFORE

37:28.347 --> 37:31.016
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST TYPICAL ALI WEIRDNESS.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.423
WHAT IS IT?

37:37.456 --> 37:40.692
IT'S THE NAME ON THE I.D.--
VIVIAN DARKBLOOM.

37:40.726 --> 37:42.794
IT'S GOTTA BE.

37:42.828 --> 37:45.797
NOW IF WE CAN ONLY FIND OUT
WHERE SHE USED IT,

37:45.831 --> 37:46.732
MAYBE WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHY.

37:48.567 --> 37:52.338
"VIVIAN DARKBLOOM"
GETS OVER 300,000 HITS.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.639
IS THAT GOOD OR BAD?

37:55.641 --> 37:58.510
"VIVIAN DARKBLOOM"
IS A PSEUDONYM
FOR VLADIMIR NABOKOV.

37:58.544 --> 37:59.778
IT'S AN ANAGRAM
OF HIS NAME.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.647
SPEAK ENGLISH.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.782
THERE WERE LIKE
TEN BIG WORDS IN THERE
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.

38:03.815 --> 38:06.652
HE'S AN AUTHOR.
HE WROTE LOLITA.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.555
IS THAT THE BOOK
WITH THE HEART-SHAPED GLASSES
ON THE COVER?

38:09.588 --> 38:11.923
YEAH. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.931
I STOLE IT...
FROM ALI.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.700
WHAT? WHY?

38:21.733 --> 38:23.101
I DIDN'T REALLY STEAL IT,
I BORROWED IT,

38:23.134 --> 38:26.772
BUT I KEPT SEEING HER WITH IT,
AND I WAS CURIOUS.

38:26.805 --> 38:30.642
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GIVE IT BACK TO HER,

38:30.676 --> 38:32.444
BUT I NEVER GOT THE CHANCE.

38:47.626 --> 38:49.395
( sighs )

38:56.134 --> 38:58.103
HEY, SORRY I MISSED YOUR CALL.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.506
IT'S KIND OF EARLY.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.375
I KNOW.
I WANTED TO TALK BEFORE SCHOOL.

39:03.409 --> 39:05.143
THE THING IS...

39:05.176 --> 39:08.013
I DO HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH YOU DATING THAT GUY,

39:08.046 --> 39:10.982
BUT NOT FOR THE REASONS
YOU THINK.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.885
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU
DATING ANYONE BUT ME,

39:13.919 --> 39:17.155
AND KNOWING YOU'RE
INTO GUYS AND GIRLS,

39:17.188 --> 39:19.991
IT JUST DOUBLES
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
I HAVE TO COMPETE WITH.

39:20.025 --> 39:24.362
TRUST ME,
YOU HAVE NO COMPETITION.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.933
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.602
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO BE ZEN ABOUT IT,

39:30.636 --> 39:33.839
I'M STILL MAD AT YOUR MOM
FOR BUSTING ME.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.041
SO NOW WHAT?

39:36.074 --> 39:40.011
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

39:43.815 --> 39:49.788
I STARTED WORKING ON THIS
LAST NIGHT.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.023
CAN I OPEN MY EYES NOW?

39:52.057 --> 39:53.459
YEAH.

39:55.627 --> 39:58.464
OH, MY GOSH.

39:58.497 --> 40:01.733
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.637
MY WAY OF SAYING SORRY
FOR RUINING DINNER.

40:05.671 --> 40:10.642
IF THE SHARKS WON'T LET YOU
BACK IN THE WATER,

40:10.676 --> 40:12.944
I'LL BRING THE WATER TO YOU.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.846
( sighs )

40:17.516 --> 40:20.151
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO ALL THIS FOR ME.

40:20.185 --> 40:24.756
I ADMIT, I LIKE
TO LIVE LIFE IN THE GREY AREA,

40:24.790 --> 40:29.461
BUT THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT YOU
IS CRYSTAL CLEAR.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.100
I LOVE YOU, EMILY.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.649
I LOVE YOU, TOO, MAYA.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.711
Man: HELLO, J&L.

41:19.745 --> 41:21.246
HEY, YOU GUYS ARE OPEN.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.514
YEAH.

41:22.548 --> 41:25.050
I JUST FOUND MY CLAIM TICKET.

41:25.083 --> 41:28.920
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CRAZY.
IT'S FROM A REALLY
LONG TIME AGO.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.822
WHAT'S THE NUMBER?

41:30.856 --> 41:33.559
0421.

41:33.592 --> 41:35.561
ALL RIGHT, HANG ON A SEC.

41:35.594 --> 41:37.829
IT'S A MIRACLE,
 BUT I ACTUALLY STILL HAVE IT.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.065
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE
 TO PICK IT UP, MISS DARKBLOOM?

41:41.867 --> 41:45.837
HELLO? MISS DARKBLOOM,
 ARE YOU STILL THERE?

41:45.871 --> 41:47.539
HELLO?
 YES, I'M HERE.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.846
THANKS, MARIN.
YOU MADE MY DAY.

41:56.181 --> 41:57.248
WHAT?

42:03.989 --> 42:05.223
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

42:05.256 --> 42:07.125
ABOUT WHAT?

42:07.158 --> 42:09.227
IF THAT'S TAKING THE HIGH ROAD,
WHAT'S THE LOW ROAD?

42:09.260 --> 42:11.930
DID YOU HAVE A STROKE?
YOU PROMISED YOU
WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.231
HANNA,
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.766
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN
SO MUCH TROUBLE.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.635
CAN ONE OF YOU GUYS
PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I DID?

42:25.376 --> 42:27.979
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

42:28.013 --> 42:30.281
WHERE WOULD I HAVE
EVEN TAKEN THAT PICTURE?

42:30.315 --> 42:33.585
IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN
IN THE GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM.

42:33.619 --> 42:35.621
NO, I DID NOT
SEND THIS TO YOU GUYS.

42:35.654 --> 42:38.624
HANNA, YOU DIDN'T
JUST SEND IT TO US.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.092
YOU SENT IT TO EVERYBODY
IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.573
( sighs )

42:58.309 --> 42:59.711
IF YOU
DIDN'T SEND THIS--

42:59.745 --> 43:02.280
DO WE EVEN HAVE TO ASK?
