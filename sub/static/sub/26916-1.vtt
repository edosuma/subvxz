WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:15.240
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.
Born a Saxon nobleman,

00:15.320 --> 00:19.880
I was robbed of my ancestral lands
and raised as a Dane and as a pagan.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.840
I am Uhtred of Bebbanburg
and I shall take what is mine.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.640
But I became
King Alfred's greatest sword warrior,

00:26.720 --> 00:31.360
defending his kingdom of Wessex
and his vision of one united England,

00:31.440 --> 00:36.640
supported by my loyal band of cutthroats,
barbarians and a fallen priest.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.880
I pray that, when battle comes,
I will not fail you.

00:41.840 --> 00:44.720
[Uhtred] I have found happiness
with my wife, Gisela,

00:44.800 --> 00:46.640
who has given me two children.

00:46.720 --> 00:50.040
Alfred has married his own daughter
to the weak Aethelred,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.880
who sees himself as king of Mercia.

00:53.440 --> 00:54.920
But taken by the Danes,

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
she fell for one warrior, Erik,
and is coveted by Haesten.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.840
[yelling]

01:00.920 --> 01:04.720
[Uhtred] This Haesten
has seemingly allied himself to Alfred.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.760
He can never be trusted.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.840
Now that Alfred's health is failing,

01:08.920 --> 01:13.480
these are dark and dangerous times
for all the peoples of this land.

01:15.440 --> 01:16.840
Destiny is all.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.280
[Skade whispering incantation]

01:36.520 --> 01:37.920
[men grunting]

01:43.360 --> 01:45.280
-[horse neighing]
-[warrior groaning]

01:49.760 --> 01:51.520
[warrior 1] God save your king!

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
[warrior 2 groaning]

01:58.000 --> 01:59.160
[gasps]

02:02.080 --> 02:04.880
[yelling]

02:11.960 --> 02:13.120
[Alfred] Father Beocca.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.560
If what we believe is true
and heaven awaits us...

02:18.120 --> 02:19.640
Which it does, Lord, no doubt.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.040
I fear that even if I were allowed to pass
through the gates,

02:22.120 --> 02:23.680
it'd still feel like purgatory.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.960
It will not.
It cannot. It is heaven.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.480
What has changed since I took the crown?

02:30.960 --> 02:33.040
Danes still raid and slaughter continues

02:33.120 --> 02:36.280
and will continue
until the day I die and beyond.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.080
What has been my purpose?

02:40.640 --> 02:44.960
Your purpose, Lord,
is that you are God's King.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.640
Without you there would be no church,

02:48.320 --> 02:50.280
no Wessex, no laws,

02:51.040 --> 02:53.400
no burhs, no havens of safety...

02:54.720 --> 02:56.160
no idea of an England.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.240
What you have done

02:58.320 --> 03:01.120
is laid the foundations
for a great and godly country.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.760
Nothing has changed.
No task is complete.

03:05.800 --> 03:09.280
And after I am gone, what then?

03:11.760 --> 03:14.000
What you have begun will continue.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.880
It must.

03:18.960 --> 03:19.800
Yes.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.360
Thank you, Beocca.

03:25.960 --> 03:26.880
It must.

03:33.360 --> 03:34.640
[Skade] Guards!

03:35.200 --> 03:36.160
Turn away now!

03:38.520 --> 03:40.640
No man is to show me his face!

03:41.320 --> 03:44.600
No man is to see me before Bloodhair!

03:44.680 --> 03:46.400
-[Skade grunts]
-[groaning]

03:49.640 --> 03:51.120
You'll go and remind the camp

03:51.200 --> 03:53.960
that Earl Sigurd
must be the first to see me.

03:54.040 --> 03:55.040
Yes, lady.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.920
[Dane groans]

03:59.080 --> 04:01.600
Once he has my message,
they'll be free to gaze.

04:05.600 --> 04:09.120
My lady, I swear, I did not look at you.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.680
I must take your eyes.

04:10.760 --> 04:13.000
Lady, no, be merciful.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.160
And your tongue.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.360
Bitch! I'll kill you!

04:20.839 --> 04:22.120
[groans]

04:23.200 --> 04:24.080
No. No.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.560
[Dane screaming]

04:47.960 --> 04:49.120
[Skade] Turn away!

04:50.600 --> 04:53.120
Only the women may look at me

04:53.200 --> 04:55.920
until I have told my Lord
what I have seen.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.840
Sigurd, my love, drink me
and make my vision real.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
Let me give you
all the strength you'll need.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.400
I see the death of a king.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.360
[groaning]

05:41.920 --> 05:42.840
Which king?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.160
I see the death...

05:46.360 --> 05:47.280
of Alfred.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.520
[yelling]

05:52.080 --> 05:53.080
[gasps]

05:58.600 --> 05:59.760
It has been seen.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.320
It has been seen!

06:03.400 --> 06:04.480
The death of Alfred

06:04.560 --> 06:07.000
and the glory of Odin's warriors
has been seen!

06:07.800 --> 06:10.360
Our path will not be simple.

06:11.560 --> 06:14.120
The gods will demand
that we earn our reward.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.120
But I make you this promise...

06:17.200 --> 06:18.920
-[grunts]
-[horse whinnies]

06:19.000 --> 06:20.200
[all cheering]

06:41.200 --> 06:42.640
From the smallest pig,

06:43.480 --> 06:45.720
to the golden crown upon Alfred's head,

06:46.600 --> 06:49.000
Wessex and everything it holds

06:49.080 --> 06:52.480
shall belong to the warriors of Bloodhair!

06:52.560 --> 06:54.480
[all cheering]

07:00.920 --> 07:02.920
[theme music playing]

07:53.400 --> 07:54.240
[Steapa] Yes!

07:57.880 --> 07:58.920
[Edward grunting]

08:00.440 --> 08:01.320
[Steapa] No.

08:02.680 --> 08:03.840
Again!

08:03.920 --> 08:04.960
[Edward grunting]

08:05.040 --> 08:08.360
Uhtred, what is your opinion
of Edward's sword skill?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.400
[both grunting]

08:12.720 --> 08:15.360
My opinion, Lord,
is that Steapa is wasting his time.

08:15.440 --> 08:16.920
Would you care to explain?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.320
I will, Lady.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.360
Steapa, stop.

08:21.080 --> 08:22.040
Stop this nonsense.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.320
You should not be using swords.
Skills are taught with a staff.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.040
-Thank you.
-I prefer the weight of a sword.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.120
It is a sign of the atheling's bravery.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.840
Let us watch, my dear.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.400
What have you learned?

08:35.480 --> 08:36.640
He learns by the day.

08:36.720 --> 08:37.760
Mother, please.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.679
Show me.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.440
[Edward grunting]

08:47.760 --> 08:51.240
Lord, that grubby Dane, Haesten, is here.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.120
Uhtred, you must test the boy.

09:02.920 --> 09:03.800
[Edward grunts]

09:03.880 --> 09:05.280
Put the child on his arse.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.000
It is not your place to speak.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.440
[Edward groaning]

09:14.960 --> 09:17.000
Oh, bad luck, Edward.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.000
Uhtred, we have a visitor.
An old friend of yours.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.680
[Uhtred] Sacrifices were made
so you would live, boy.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.880
From now on you practice only
with a staff. You learn from being hit.

09:38.520 --> 09:41.920
There is warrior inside you.
We will find him.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.960
[chuckles] Thank you, Uhtred.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.920
[Erkenwald] You do
as the Lord Uhtred says, Prince Edward.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.240
He has your safety and welfare in mind.

09:49.320 --> 09:52.120
Bishop Erkenwald. Thank you.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.680
-I trust your wife is well?
-She is.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.240
[Erkenwald] Pretty girl.
Her name escapes me.

09:57.800 --> 10:00.320
She's called Gisela, Lord, a pagan.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.520
She is once again with child.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.080
A boy.

10:05.240 --> 10:06.560
Your child shall be a boy.

10:07.560 --> 10:08.880
Brother Godwin has a gift.

10:10.080 --> 10:10.920
God-given.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.760
If you will excuse me, Lord.

10:15.840 --> 10:16.880
Of course.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.360
Edward, you are late for your lessons.

10:21.320 --> 10:22.160
Come.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.200
[sighs]

10:31.560 --> 10:33.880
I hear there are ealdormen
who wish you dead.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.080
You made a whore
of a young girl and left her pupped.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.440
She is no whore.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.760
Bad Edward.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.960
She is no whore.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.160
Say it again, I dare you.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.480
Bad Edward.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.400
His name is Sigurd.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.480
His men call him Bloodhair.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.840
[Aelswith] I don't wish to know why.
Something depraved, I'm sure.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.080
[Uhtred] I have a man watching
Bloodhair's camp,

11:04.160 --> 11:05.360
but I'm curious...

11:06.200 --> 11:07.960
He didn't ask you to join, Haesten?

11:09.760 --> 11:10.680
He has.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.840
I declined.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.240
Like you, I have given my word.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.160
Unlike you,
I've accepted the King's missionary.

11:19.240 --> 11:20.880
[Uhtred] Your word
means nothing.

11:20.960 --> 11:23.240
[Haesten] Does the peace
among us not hold?

11:23.640 --> 11:26.920
Do my wife and children
not wish to become Christian?

11:27.680 --> 11:28.640
[Aelswith] They do?

11:28.720 --> 11:32.040
[Haesten] They do, Lady.
I've asked the priest to arrange it.

11:32.120 --> 11:33.800
That is good news.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.280
It is certainly news.

11:35.840 --> 11:37.920
It should be an occasion, Lord.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.600
[Alfred] I will consider it

11:39.680 --> 11:42.360
as soon as we are done
with Earl Sigurd, Bloodhair.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.840
Will he attack or raid?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.440
[Uhtred] He will raid
to assess your strength and readiness.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.880
It is you who must attack.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.680
Destroy his army
and send a message to all Northmen.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.640
[exhales sharply]

11:55.080 --> 11:55.960
[vomits]

11:56.040 --> 11:58.400
My Lord has eaten something
that does not agree?

12:01.960 --> 12:03.320
Too much wine, Lord?

12:05.280 --> 12:06.160
[exhales]

12:21.880 --> 12:23.160
Uhtred, you are right.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.840
Sigurd landing his ships on Wessex soil
is unacceptable.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.760
-We will attack before the winter bites.
-Soonest, Lord.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.320
Then we march.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.160
Beocca, send word to Aethelred of Mercia.

12:34.880 --> 12:36.960
This is a threat to both our lands.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.480
Our allies must join
with the Wessex guard.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.680
Yes, Lord.
I will draft the letter at once.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.880
Inform him, we shall join him
at the Burh of Aescengum.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.040
I will now, um...

12:52.200 --> 12:53.480
take some air.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.080
How is the Lady Aethelflaed these days
and the child?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.560
Who does the girl resemble--

13:07.640 --> 13:08.960
One more word against her,

13:09.040 --> 13:12.240
I'll shove that food so far down
that you'll be shitting it out.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.240
I have seen him do it.
It's a miracle.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.280
I am saying nothing
her husband Aethelred is not saying.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.640
And I would say
you are in Aethelflaed's debt.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.880
You have men and ships
not because you earned them,

13:21.960 --> 13:24.040
but solely because
she did kill your lord, Sigefrid.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.200
I remember what the bitch did.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.840
I will never forget.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.880
That is enough.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.640
Tell her, I pray
our paths will meet once again.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.760
[Uhtred] Haesten.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.720
No more.

13:40.880 --> 13:45.320
Bloodhair has a woman
you would like, Uhtred.

13:46.880 --> 13:47.720
Skade.

13:47.800 --> 13:52.280
Her beauty blinds you like the sun,
yet she has all the darkness of the night.

13:53.040 --> 13:54.080
She's a seer.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.120
She's of the devil, Father.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.760
I'd say it was a pleasure
to see you, Uhtred...

14:08.680 --> 14:10.040
but it never is.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.200
Likewise.

14:14.720 --> 14:18.840
May God forgive me, but I'd like
to remove that man's head with a blunt ax.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.080
The King's health, Beocca, it worsens.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.920
From time to time, yes.

14:28.480 --> 14:30.040
That is why the time you spend

14:30.120 --> 14:32.280
with the aetheling, Edward,
is so important.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.280
Alfred's work must continue,
and you can ensure that it does.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.080
Tell the King I'll meet him
on the road to Aescengum or at the burh.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.520
-Where are you going?
-To my wife.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.200
Then on to see Bloodhair for myself.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.920
You should seek the King's permission.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.760
For once.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.280
[people screaming]

15:26.440 --> 15:27.520
A good morning, Lord?

15:27.600 --> 15:30.960
[Uhtred] Ready yourselves and the horses.
We leave before nightfall.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.920
-For where?
-For battle.

15:33.560 --> 15:34.960
And not before time.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.160
I'm a warrior.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.320
[boy] I'll take this.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.000
What's this, Gisela?

15:45.560 --> 15:48.360
We have servants to prepare food.
You should be resting.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.480
I have said this to her.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.960
How can I rest
with this wild boy inside of me?

15:54.040 --> 15:57.400
A priest has just told me the same,
that you are carrying a boy.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.720
Of course it's a boy.
He will not keep still.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.360
Thankfully, he will be the last.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.280
You can't prevent that.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.240
I know how to prevent it.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.800
He will be the last.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.600
You are marching?

16:20.120 --> 16:22.760
Yes, I will join Finan
and then we are marching.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.600
Thyra will be here.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.760
And I have sent word home,
to Coccham, to Hild.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.840
She'll be with you for the birth
should I not return in time.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.120
But I promise, I will return.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.040
Mmm-hmm.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.600
And when you do,
you will be sleeping alone.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.440
You would do that to me?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.520
Oh, yes, I will do that to you...

16:47.640 --> 16:48.480
for a time.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.120
We move!

17:28.560 --> 17:29.440
[panting]

17:35.080 --> 17:36.080
Good evening to you.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.360
Though I'm pointing a sword
at your heart...

17:43.480 --> 17:44.440
I am a friend.

17:46.360 --> 17:47.360
Habit.

17:48.880 --> 17:49.720
With me.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.480
Then you can tell me
all about your village.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
[villagers screaming]

18:03.760 --> 18:04.640
[woman groaning]

18:14.520 --> 18:17.040
[shakily] Holy Father,
spare me from this ordeal.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.240
Stop my heart from beating
and take me now.

18:19.320 --> 18:22.000
I beg of all the saints in heaven
to strike me down.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.360
Take my soul and hide. Spare me, Lord.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.200
It is not death I fear,
it is the path. Lord, I beg you.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.240
Stop my heart from beating
and take me now.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.680
Please, please.

18:32.760 --> 18:33.840
Where is the silver?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.320
There is none.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.400
Where is the silver?

18:36.480 --> 18:38.840
I'm begging you to believe me.
I do not lie.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.400
If you wish to be cooked alive,
then I will cook you alive.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.040
[monk] There is no silver!
I swear!

18:48.880 --> 18:49.720
Lady...

18:50.280 --> 18:51.760
[whimpering]

18:51.840 --> 18:53.720
[Skade] The silver!

18:53.800 --> 18:55.400
[monk sobbing]

18:55.480 --> 18:56.440
You will
answer her.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.920
[monk] I have answered her, Lord.
There is no wealth here!

19:01.680 --> 19:03.360
[sobbing continues]

19:04.200 --> 19:05.360
Put him into the fire.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.560
No, please!
Please, I beg you!

19:10.280 --> 19:11.920
The silver!

19:12.000 --> 19:14.640
Can any of you holy men answer for him?

19:14.720 --> 19:16.320
God in heaven, help me!

19:16.400 --> 19:18.040
[screaming]

19:22.640 --> 19:23.840
[monk] Help me!

19:30.320 --> 19:32.840
You have no right, Lord.
He was mine to question and to kill.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.600
You have no right!

19:35.680 --> 19:38.920
This is a church,
and a church holds silver.

19:41.000 --> 19:41.920
You.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.600
What's your name?

19:45.440 --> 19:47.520
I am called Brother Hubert, Lord.

19:47.600 --> 19:52.040
My Lord, I swear, we are a poor church.
We have food and ale, but we have no more.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.360
Brother Hubert...

19:54.280 --> 19:56.560
if you speak the truth,
you'll take your own life.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.720
You will do it now and save your friends.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.200
But, Lord, my soul will be damned.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.600
Take your life like a warrior!
And we'll ask for only food and ale.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.800
Lord, I swear, there is no silver.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.040
They're yours to do with as you please.

20:23.840 --> 20:24.880
[monks whimpering]

20:29.280 --> 20:30.680
[muttering indistinctly]

20:41.680 --> 20:44.000
Are you certain
you will not use the carriage?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.440
I'm certain.
We ride to Aescengum.

20:48.080 --> 20:48.920
Steapa.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.960
[grunts]

21:22.440 --> 21:24.880
[villagers screaming]

21:25.360 --> 21:29.920
[Dane] Lady, Bloodhair is heading on
to the next village in search of silver.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.640
-Did you hear me? He's ready to leave.
-Then let him!

21:36.080 --> 21:39.680
We will remain here until I've finished
my work with the priests.

21:43.160 --> 21:46.480
Tell him we will follow.
But he is to leave my guard.

21:47.040 --> 21:47.880
Yes.

21:49.080 --> 21:50.280
[Hubert groaning softly]

21:58.080 --> 21:59.160
Good morning, Hubert.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.120
I believe you now.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.240
There is no silver.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.480
So, what else can you give me?

22:09.840 --> 22:11.720
[Hubert sobbing]

22:34.560 --> 22:36.240
[Aldhelm] We are ready to march.

22:37.600 --> 22:38.720
Then you should march.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.880
But with half of the guard, no more.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.280
You will follow?

22:44.880 --> 22:47.320
Yes, we are allies with Wessex.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.680
There is talk of Danes
raiding on our northern border.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.520
There are forever Danes there.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.760
I shall remain here
for the good of Mercia.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.240
We cannot neglect our own lands.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.120
Lord, it makes sense
to remain close to Wessex.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.920
Alfred will not live forever
and the aetheling, Edward, is a boy.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.960
He seems to be doing his very best
at living forever.

23:12.160 --> 23:14.440
He's constantly ill, but he will not die.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.920
If you see him, tell him
I am busy with Vikings.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.600
I'll inform my father that you'll join us
as soon as you are able, Lord.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.560
Thank you, lady.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.040
You are riding to battle?
Is that not forbidden?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.600
I wish to see the King.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.160
He is a king. He is not the King.

23:34.720 --> 23:37.080
There are kings and kingdoms all over.

23:38.040 --> 23:39.520
Aldhelm, are we ready?

23:40.360 --> 23:42.960
-Lord, you are certain you will not ride?
-Go!

23:43.040 --> 23:44.920
In God's name, go.
Leave me in peace.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.080
Yes, Lord.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.640
Good luck at the northern border.
Return safely.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.160
You should be leading your men.

23:57.120 --> 24:00.680
I do not wish to hear the whining voice
of the so-called Lady of Mercia.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.240
Which is why I prefer you
to spend time at your own estate.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.200
Then I shall leave you in your peace.

24:07.840 --> 24:08.960
How is your daughter?

24:10.560 --> 24:11.880
Our daughter is well,

24:11.960 --> 24:14.920
though I pray she does not inherit
her father's temperament.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.120
Nor the morals of her mother.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.480
Whore!

24:22.800 --> 24:24.160
You have diminished me.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.880
[bird squawks]

24:28.680 --> 24:30.800
We march into Wessex...

24:32.080 --> 24:33.800
to the aid of Wessex,

24:33.880 --> 24:40.280
but be in no doubt, what we fight for
is the freedom and the glory of Mercia.

24:40.840 --> 24:44.760
And once again,
we will show the King Alfred

24:44.840 --> 24:46.520
how a warrior should be.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.600
[all cheering]

24:48.680 --> 24:53.120
We will show the bastard heathen
how a warrior should be!

24:53.200 --> 24:55.920
[all cheering]

25:01.520 --> 25:02.960
[men speaking indistinctly]

25:04.240 --> 25:07.680
She's in there, inside the church.
Am I still needed?

25:09.480 --> 25:10.720
Go find your family.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.200
[breathes deeply]

25:45.520 --> 25:46.680
[guard laughs]

25:46.760 --> 25:49.440
Who are you?
What do you want?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.400
I would like you all to surrender.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.680
Or I will smite you.

25:55.000 --> 25:55.840
What did he say?

25:57.360 --> 25:58.200
Smite?

25:58.280 --> 25:59.560
What is "smite"?

25:59.640 --> 26:01.280
It's a word, isn't it?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.760
A word from the Holy Book.

26:03.840 --> 26:07.320
It means slay or kill.

26:08.160 --> 26:09.160
I will kill you.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.760
[guards laughing]

26:11.320 --> 26:12.240
Smite.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.720
-You will smite all of us?
-Yeah, most.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.920
Some might run away, hopefully.

26:20.520 --> 26:22.240
I've got... I've got a sword.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.120
A very sharp sword.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.760
But I prefer your surrender.

26:27.680 --> 26:29.560
-[guard] Kill him.
-Now!

26:30.120 --> 26:31.280
[groans]

26:33.760 --> 26:35.680
[men grunting]

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
Haesten says she is of the devil.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.520
Then it might be an idea
to bar the door and burn the place down.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.360
-Why not?
-To Bloodhair, she will be priceless.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.080
[Uhtred] You are Skade?

27:30.440 --> 27:33.560
You! You will do nothing
except go to your lord.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.440
You will tell him that
Uhtred of Bebbanburg has his witch.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.480
I knew it was you.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.480
There will be a ransom.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.240
No. You will go to my lord

27:44.320 --> 27:47.320
and you will tell him
that from this moment forth,

27:47.800 --> 27:49.640
Uhtred of Bebbanburg is cursed.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.320
The witch holds his heart in her hands

27:55.400 --> 27:57.880
and she will squeeze it...

28:00.560 --> 28:01.720
and break it.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.640
Go.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.280
It is you who are my prisoner now, Uhtred.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
Seize her.

28:18.160 --> 28:20.680
I said seize her, Sihtric.
Now, bind her hands.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.960
I have aligned myself
with the three spinners of fate

28:23.040 --> 28:24.120
and seized your life.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.720
-You belong to me.
-And her mouth.

28:26.800 --> 28:29.720
Your path is the path I choose for you,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.840
And your spirit is mine to torment.

28:39.920 --> 28:40.840
Cover her eyes.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.080
We'll take her to Aescengum.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.440
I think she may have got herself
inside his head.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.320
He should kill her and be done with it.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.280
That will not kill the curse.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.800
There is no curse.

29:30.280 --> 29:33.280
And if I say there is no Christian God,
does that make it so?

29:33.360 --> 29:35.560
There is no curse, Sihtric.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.320
I have seen women throw a curse
and the next day a man is dead.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.960
Right, that is enough talking.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.680
To speak of it makes it stronger.

30:04.400 --> 30:08.520
[Alfred] Uhtred, we're discussing strategy
and I have decided we shall remain here,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.160
within the burh, and wait.

30:10.240 --> 30:11.200
[Uhtred] For what?

30:11.280 --> 30:14.160
-[Alfred] Bloodhair to attack.
-Why will he attack?

30:14.720 --> 30:18.240
Is that not what Danes do, Uhtred?
They cannot help themselves.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.920
Why should he not? I am here.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.200
You are here, and so too is your guard.

30:22.680 --> 30:26.440
Why throw men against the walls of a burh
when Winchester's riches are unprotected?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.400
Would he do that?

30:27.480 --> 30:29.960
He doesn't have a large army
to hold Winchester.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.680
-What if Haesten joined him?
-You're saying we should've stayed home?

30:33.760 --> 30:36.240
If you believe
the burh's advantage dismissed,

30:36.320 --> 30:37.840
you must have an alternative.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.920
-[Uhtred] I don't know you.
-I am Sigebriht, son of Sigelf.

30:42.000 --> 30:45.560
It is my villages that the heathen burn.
My father built these walls.

30:45.640 --> 30:49.200
He built them well, Sigebriht,
which is why Bloodhair will not attack.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.880
-He will not want to lose men.
-Not even to kill a king?

30:52.960 --> 30:57.320
He will wait for us to starve
or he will pass, Lord. He will not attack.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.400
But we must. That is still my advice.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.320
If Winchester is vulnerable, Lord--

31:01.400 --> 31:03.800
This woman that you have taken,
why is she here?

31:05.240 --> 31:06.320
She has value.

31:07.880 --> 31:11.360
And Sigurd will want her back.
I refuse to call him Bloodhair.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.920
-He will.
-[Aethelwold] She is what to him?

31:14.000 --> 31:14.880
A wife?

31:15.440 --> 31:16.480
A lover?

31:17.080 --> 31:19.400
She's a... a seer...

31:20.920 --> 31:21.760
sorceress.

31:22.560 --> 31:23.400
[Alfred] Hmm.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.440
The simple mind of a Dane
believes in signs, Edward.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.240
If a bird flew from their camp to ours,
they would see it as a sign and follow.

31:33.320 --> 31:35.480
They would march into battle

31:35.560 --> 31:38.320
all because a seer caught sight of a bird.

31:39.240 --> 31:42.360
Yes, Lord, it can happen that way.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.800
Then it follows that without his seer,
there can be no signs.

31:45.880 --> 31:49.480
-Sigurd is blind. There can be no battle.
-You are both right and wrong.

31:49.560 --> 31:51.520
We wait, Uhtred.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.120
Now...

31:58.840 --> 31:59.960
I wish to look at her.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.640
Skade.

32:13.280 --> 32:15.440
Father, you do not need
to trouble yourself.

32:15.520 --> 32:16.360
No, Lord?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.000
[Uhtred] Unlock the door.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.280
-[Sihtric] What are they doing?
-Alfred said he'd like to hump the witch.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.040
No word of a lie.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.400
[Skade whispering incantation]

32:38.080 --> 32:39.320
[whispering continues]

32:50.000 --> 32:51.320
Uhtred, you will leave us.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.240
Is that wise, Lord?

32:55.080 --> 32:58.240
She is secured by chains
and I will not venture too close.

32:59.000 --> 32:59.840
You will leave.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.520
[exhales]

33:14.040 --> 33:15.040
You left him alone?

33:15.800 --> 33:16.680
It's his wish.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.320
You believe that Bloodhair
will go directly to Winchester?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.760
Our families are there unprotected.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.800
That is why we cannot wait
for an attack that will not come.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.160
Uhtred, you must...

33:29.240 --> 33:30.800
make him see the danger...

33:31.560 --> 33:32.480
for those we love.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.800
You reek of death, Lord.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.960
I do. Sadly, I do.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.440
Why sadly?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.440
You have a rich life and reputation.

33:46.520 --> 33:49.440
There is more to be done.
I must see that it is done.

33:53.520 --> 33:54.960
Ask your question.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.880
How long...

34:07.160 --> 34:09.800
before I am taken? Do you know?

34:11.440 --> 34:13.480
Is that something that you can see?

34:15.880 --> 34:17.880
[chains rattling]

34:23.040 --> 34:24.679
You will not see another summer.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.080
But your name will live on.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.199
You will be remembered

34:31.159 --> 34:36.239
as the first, the last
and only king of all Saxons.

34:43.880 --> 34:45.679
I do enjoy the summertime.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.600
[whispers] Sigurd, my Lord,
Bloodhair, my lover,

35:11.680 --> 35:13.440
hear me, free me, avenge me.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.720
Come for me, die for me,
want me, desire me.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.400
Sigurd, free me!

35:22.080 --> 35:25.400
Bloodhair, come to me!

35:25.920 --> 35:28.440
Die for me, avenge me!

35:28.520 --> 35:29.960
Free me!

35:30.800 --> 35:32.920
There's a king in this camp!

35:33.560 --> 35:35.960
Come to me! Desire me!

35:36.040 --> 35:38.840
If she insists upon calling,
we should make use of her.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.120
[Skade] Free me!

35:44.200 --> 35:45.960
Bloodhair!

35:46.720 --> 35:50.440
Come for me, avenge me,
free me, I demand it!

35:51.000 --> 35:51.840
Bloodhair!

35:51.920 --> 35:55.000
-When can we bind her mouth?
-[Skade] Die for me, desire me!

35:55.080 --> 35:58.480
-Let her sing.
-[Skade] There is a king in this town!

35:58.560 --> 36:00.280
That is not singing.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.240
[Skade] Bloodhair!

36:02.320 --> 36:04.640
-[Sigebriht] Lord Uhtred.
-[Skade] Come for me!

36:04.720 --> 36:07.040
Are you allowing that woman
to wail all night?

36:07.120 --> 36:09.680
-[Skade] Free me!
-For a little while longer, yes.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.320
[Skade] Bloodhair!

36:11.400 --> 36:14.280
There's a king for you to kill!

36:15.000 --> 36:19.480
-[guard] Shut her up!
-[Skade] Come for me, avenge me, free me!

36:20.440 --> 36:22.080
I demand it!

36:22.800 --> 36:25.320
Die for me! Desire me!

36:25.400 --> 36:28.280
[sighs] Here is a bit
of loose talk for you.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.440
[Skade] Bloodhair!

36:29.520 --> 36:32.600
Sigebriht there, son of whoever,

36:33.160 --> 36:35.920
would like to rip the innards
from young Edward's belly.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.600
-Would you like to know why?
-[Skade] Bloodhair!

36:38.680 --> 36:39.600
Um...

36:40.960 --> 36:42.800
-No.
-I'll tell you.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.880
Edward, the non-bastard son of Alfred,

36:47.440 --> 36:51.440
has whelped twins on the girl
whom Sigebriht did love.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.800
And does Sigebriht still love this girl?

36:53.880 --> 36:58.160
[Skade] Die for me, desire me! Bloodhair!

36:58.240 --> 37:00.800
Can someone not just cut her throat?

37:00.880 --> 37:04.320
Why are you telling me this?
It's of no concern to me.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.440
They will make it your concern, Uhtred.

37:09.040 --> 37:12.880
They will find a way
and Edward shall become your charge.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.440
You're a kingmaker, my friend.

37:17.640 --> 37:18.880
And Alfred knows it.

37:38.040 --> 37:39.280
[Skade] I am undecided.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.960
I could take the place of your woman,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.720
Together we could rule
from north to south.

37:48.880 --> 37:49.840
Hear it.

37:51.720 --> 37:52.640
Hear it.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.480
You men there,
take her down and return her to the cell.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.240
Let her rest.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.520
[Skade] Good night, Lord.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.120
Why have you not killed me?

39:24.200 --> 39:25.520
What is it you want?

39:26.480 --> 39:28.080
I'm worth more than just silver.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.320
Put the food into your mouth and chew.

39:34.120 --> 39:35.800
If it is me that you want...

39:37.520 --> 39:38.520
then have me.

39:57.160 --> 39:58.440
I will not object.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.200
I have no need of a whore.

40:05.840 --> 40:07.640
You will soon have need of a woman.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.960
You have not killed me, Lord,
because that will leave you cursed still.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.000
Until the end and beyond,

40:18.680 --> 40:20.240
our paths are entwined

40:21.600 --> 40:23.080
and our fate is shared.

40:23.160 --> 40:25.080
[bell ringing]

40:26.400 --> 40:27.240
He is here.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.320
[ringing continues]

40:30.720 --> 40:31.880
[door closes]

40:39.920 --> 40:42.680
Lord, it is Bloodhair!
He has hostages!

40:42.760 --> 40:47.040
Every man to the walls!
Every sword and spear must be ready!

40:50.360 --> 40:52.000
[woman whimpers]

40:54.640 --> 40:55.960
[women screaming]

41:01.760 --> 41:04.320
Osferth, prepare to open the gates.
Finan, with me.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.480
-[Beocca] What is it?
-[Alfred] Who is it?

41:06.560 --> 41:09.480
-Bloodhair, Lord, with hostages.
-He wishes to negotiate?

41:09.560 --> 41:10.520
[Uhtred] Possibly.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.320
[women yelping]

41:20.720 --> 41:22.200
[Bloodhair] Uhtred Ragnarson.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.520
What depravity is this?

41:24.440 --> 41:27.200
[Bloodhair] Alfred of Wessex,
you have my woman.

41:27.280 --> 41:30.000
Return her now or your people will die.

41:31.640 --> 41:34.000
Lord, I know each of those wretches.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.760
Does he wish to negotiate or not?

41:35.840 --> 41:39.360
If it is your woman that you want,
then let us negotiate!

41:39.440 --> 41:41.960
We don't wish to see
the death of another innocent!

41:42.040 --> 41:45.120
-I've said all I will say.
-[woman] I beg you, not the young.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.520
Spare the young!

41:46.600 --> 41:47.640
[women screaming]

41:47.720 --> 41:50.040
[woman] I beg you, Lord,
not the young, please.

41:50.120 --> 41:53.200
Spare the young, Lord.
They can serve you. Please, Lord.

41:53.280 --> 41:54.280
[women screaming]

41:55.560 --> 41:57.800
Osferth, the gates.
Steapa, be ready.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.200
-They are killing women, Lord.
-The gates!

42:04.200 --> 42:05.040
Earl Sigurd!

42:06.080 --> 42:07.720
Kill one more hostage

42:07.800 --> 42:10.000
and I shall let every man here
see her nakedness

42:10.680 --> 42:13.080
and then I shall spill her guts.
Just one more!

42:13.160 --> 42:14.840
Do it, Lord.
I'll see you in the next life.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.600
Kill them all! Attack!

42:17.680 --> 42:19.560
[groans]

42:20.720 --> 42:23.400
-[Skade] Kill them! Attack!
-She is an angry woman.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.880
[Uhtred] What's your answer?

42:26.160 --> 42:28.280
I have a mind to kill her.
She tires me.

42:28.360 --> 42:30.080
He cannot do it. He's cursed.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.840
Kill them all!

42:32.920 --> 42:34.320
You will not harm her again!

42:36.320 --> 42:38.280
[Skade groaning]

42:44.360 --> 42:45.520
The price has risen.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.760
You will spare the hostages,

42:47.840 --> 42:49.960
free them
and send them across to the burh.

42:50.040 --> 42:53.640
What I'll do is feed you your own cock.
Release her.

42:54.200 --> 42:56.640
You have until sunset
to free the hostages.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.760
Or each man in this fortress
will take his turn.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.400
Until sunset!

43:04.000 --> 43:06.280
I believe negotiations are over, Lord.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.960
You will not see Valhalla,
Uhtred Ragnarson, I swear it!

43:11.040 --> 43:13.480
-[Skade] Bloodhair!
-Uhtred Ragnarson!

43:14.040 --> 43:16.520
-[Skade] Kill them!
-[Bloodhair] Uhtred Ragnarson!

43:16.600 --> 43:19.760
Do not harm one hair from her head.
She's mine!

43:21.080 --> 43:23.000
Lord, we need to change our plan.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.760
We cannot wait for him to attack
because he will not.

43:26.920 --> 43:29.480
Her value is even greater
than I first thought.

43:29.560 --> 43:31.400
He will wait
for as long as it takes.

43:31.480 --> 43:33.680
Aethelred and the Mercians will be close.

43:33.760 --> 43:34.840
They will be seen.

43:36.120 --> 43:37.720
We must stop them on the road.

43:37.800 --> 43:41.360
I can send Finan to do just that,
and then we must join them.

43:41.920 --> 43:43.880
We must choose the place of battle,

43:43.960 --> 43:46.320
but we must act quickly,
while his blood burns.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.800
Join Aethelred where?

43:49.080 --> 43:51.640
I am thinking Fearnham.
There's a hill.

43:51.720 --> 43:53.480
I know it.
It gives us an advantage.

43:53.560 --> 43:55.120
How do we join Aethelred here,

43:55.200 --> 43:57.560
and how do we ensure
Earl Sigurd will follow?

43:57.640 --> 44:00.960
Finan will find the Mercians
and we will ensure Bloodhair follows.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.640
You and I, Lord, will draw him.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.640
And if Aethelred cannot be found?

44:06.120 --> 44:07.320
[Uhtred] We fight alone.

44:08.360 --> 44:10.600
But we must act quickly.
It must be today.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.040
I'm ready, Lords.

44:14.760 --> 44:16.880
It won't take me long
to find the Mercians.

44:20.400 --> 44:22.840
To Fearnham. Go.

44:22.920 --> 44:24.440
[wind blowing]

44:26.880 --> 44:28.400
[Saxon guard] Open the gates!

44:29.160 --> 44:30.000
Psst.

44:32.960 --> 44:33.800
The gates.

44:34.760 --> 44:36.480
We go and we do not stop.

44:37.120 --> 44:41.200
They cannot overtake us!
They must not overtake us!

44:44.480 --> 44:46.760
For the freedom of Wessex!

44:46.840 --> 44:48.480
[all cheering]

44:54.440 --> 44:55.840
They're escaping.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.600
Lord! Lord, they are running!

45:00.000 --> 45:02.480
Lord, the Saxon army
is fleeing the fortress.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.320
-Who did you see?
-I saw them all.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.880
I saw the Lady Skade.
I saw Uhtred Ragnarson.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.200
The whole army.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.160
Every man and every sword with me.
It's time!

45:11.760 --> 45:12.920
Horses!

45:14.920 --> 45:16.640
[Saxon guard] Close the gates!

45:17.280 --> 45:19.200
[yelling]

45:19.280 --> 45:20.640
[Danes yelling]

45:33.200 --> 45:34.080
[Sigebriht] Lord!

45:34.720 --> 45:35.800
They're giving chase.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.280
They're giving chase.

45:38.360 --> 45:39.520
[Alfred] We wait...

45:40.120 --> 45:42.920
long enough for them not to see
they are being followed.

45:43.480 --> 45:44.840
And we pray.

45:54.160 --> 45:55.440
[horse neighs]

45:56.240 --> 45:58.280
[driver] Lord, the cart is stuck.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.560
Release the horse from its harness
and ride.

46:00.640 --> 46:02.600
Sihtric, your ax.

46:16.080 --> 46:18.680
They've been after silver,
so let's give them some.

46:22.240 --> 46:23.880
Keep going! Ride!

46:24.880 --> 46:26.600
[Steapa] We must not be seen!

46:27.160 --> 46:28.120
We track them.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.920
And then we kill the bastards!

46:31.000 --> 46:31.920
[all cheering]

46:47.760 --> 46:49.320
[Bloodhair] May be a trap.

47:02.200 --> 47:03.360
[Osferth] Is this the place?

47:04.280 --> 47:06.360
-Is this Fearnham?
-It is.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.680
Maybe Finan didn't make the journey.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.920
Do we wait for the Danes
to catch us?

47:19.320 --> 47:20.680
It's silver, Lord.

47:20.760 --> 47:23.360
They must have been too afraid
to fix the cart.

47:23.440 --> 47:25.960
Wrap it in cloth. Keep it safe.
Let's move on.

47:26.600 --> 47:28.320
I want every Saxon dead by nightfall.

47:29.200 --> 47:30.360
[Dane] Move on!

47:38.680 --> 47:41.200
Your man is here. I know it.

47:42.760 --> 47:44.360
[horses neighing]

47:50.240 --> 47:51.480
[Uhtred] It is Finan.

47:55.960 --> 47:57.200
And the Mercians.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.160
We are an army!

48:03.440 --> 48:06.160
-Glory shall be ours!
-[all cheering]

48:08.040 --> 48:09.920
[all yelling]

48:20.480 --> 48:22.360
[Gisela straining]

48:22.920 --> 48:24.360
[breathes heavily]

48:25.080 --> 48:26.840
Shield wall!

48:39.360 --> 48:40.360
[Uhtred] Ready!

48:45.400 --> 48:48.440
They have the hill.
We have the numbers and will of the gods!

48:49.000 --> 48:50.600
Odin's warriors!

48:50.680 --> 48:51.840
[all cheering]

48:51.920 --> 48:55.000
[Uhtred] We stand our ground!
They will come onto us,

48:55.080 --> 48:58.000
and we will take their heads
from their shoulders!

49:04.360 --> 49:06.600
No Saxon leaves this field alive!

49:07.120 --> 49:08.760
[all yelling]

49:15.120 --> 49:16.360
Hold firm!

49:21.840 --> 49:24.800
We do not break!
We stand our ground!
