00:17.951 --> 00:18.951
(phone rings)

00:18.953 --> 00:20.285
Hello?

00:20.287 --> 00:22.554
Hello, "dog,"
it's Principal Foster.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.723
Oh, hey.
Did you just call me "dog"?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.725
You're vice principal now.
We're peers.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.127
Oh.
Good news-- I have

00:28.129 --> 00:30.229
a replacement
for your science class.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.231
It's about time,
you old son of a bitch.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.632
What?!

00:33.634 --> 00:35.401
Too casual?
Uh, what?

00:35.403 --> 00:36.902
Hello?
Sorry, what?
You're breaking up.

00:36.904 --> 00:38.003
Hello?
Dog?

00:38.005 --> 00:39.071
Hello?
(staticky): I can't...

00:39.073 --> 00:40.139
...hear you.
Sorry, hello?

00:40.141 --> 00:41.173
Bad reception, sorry.

00:41.175 --> 00:43.008
Hold on.
(staticky): ...breaking up...

00:43.010 --> 00:44.910
I'm so sorry. They're building
a new building next door

00:44.912 --> 00:46.845
and I have terrible reception.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.148
Hey, no more phone calls!
Get out of my room!

00:49.150 --> 00:51.517
It's the only place I can get
a signal, dude-- you know that.
Out!

00:51.519 --> 00:52.985
Look at the stick--
is it red or blue? Uh, yeah...

00:52.987 --> 00:54.586
Well, sir, I...
Get out of my room.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.355
Hello? Hello? Hello?
- Hello?
Hello... stop.

00:56.357 --> 00:58.924
Is it red or blue?
Hey, ow, Schmidt!

00:58.926 --> 01:00.592
The scarf has been
backordered a month.
Wait, hello?

01:00.594 --> 01:01.994
Meanwhile the hat
is just sitting here.
Yeah, hello.

01:01.996 --> 01:03.328
This is not a
business center.
Hello?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.430
Get out of my room.
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:04.432 --> 01:05.898
It's my man time.
Mama?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.900
Mama, unplug it, okay?
SCHMIDT: Hello? Hello.

01:07.902 --> 01:10.569
If you unplug it,
it cannot electrocute you.
Hello? Hello.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.004
It's blue? Oh, yes!
Mr. Foster...

01:12.006 --> 01:13.072
No, I don't want blue.
Hello, dog. Dog?

01:13.074 --> 01:14.239
With a bisque hat?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.274
I'll look insane!

01:15.276 --> 01:17.176
Why do you have
an electric guitar?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.578
Aah!
- Hello?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.747
This phone situation
has me really jazzed up!

01:21.749 --> 01:23.115
Excuse my language.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.616
Now, I'm gonna
propose something.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.618
Something insane.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.454
Now you just all
have to stay calm

01:28.456 --> 01:30.255
and trust me.

01:31.624 --> 01:32.791
Fascinating.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.859
Where do you
put your music?

01:33.861 --> 01:35.294
Why is there
a rope?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.962
(phone rings)
(gasps) It's ringing.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.931
Whoa, that's cool.
Just like
the movies.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.766
We should answer it with,
like, really funny voices.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.968
Yeah.
We don't know
who it is.

01:42.970 --> 01:45.204
It could be anybody.
Could be Tanya
from sixth grade.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.139
Yeah.
(stops ringing)

01:47.141 --> 01:48.941
Oh...
- Oh.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.909
Next time it rings,
we should answer it.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.912
¶ Who's that girl? ¶
¶<i> Who's that girl?</i> ¶

01:53.914 --> 01:55.447
¶ Who's that girl? ¶

01:55.449 --> 01:56.882
¶<i> Who's that girl?</i> ¶
¶ It's Jess. ¶

01:59.285 --> 02:00.819
Just can't stop
looking at this thing.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.988
Man, I used to be so great
at talking on the phone, man.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.423
You know,
something about the cord

02:04.425 --> 02:07.493
and the handset that
just really set me at ease.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.927
You were weirdly smooth.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.329
If you slow dance with Nick,

02:10.331 --> 02:11.763
I'll hold hands with Amy.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.932
Just make sure she cut
her fingernails, though.

02:13.934 --> 02:15.267
Tell her I'll make her
a mix tape.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.735
I'm just being stupid.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.270
Tell her I'll make her
a mix tape.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.938
It was going great, by the way.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.106
If this isn't sexy,

02:21.108 --> 02:22.341
I don't know what the heck is.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.109
Something just
came over him.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.344
He was amazing.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.845
I'm just excited to add
a third number:

02:26.847 --> 02:28.981
Home, work<i> and</i> cell.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.749
Damn, I'm reachable.
I'm definitely gonna

02:30.751 --> 02:33.252
mention that in my profile
in<i> Business, Man!</i> magazine.

02:33.254 --> 02:36.088
<i>Businessman</i> magazine?
No, no, no. Check that out:
<i>Business, Man!</i> magazine.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.422
I've gotten
a lot of heat

02:37.424 --> 02:39.091
from working on the
sponge account.

02:39.093 --> 02:41.927
I'm telling you, this is
the first step in my quest

02:41.929 --> 02:43.929
to becoming a millionaire.
Well, I think
that's a weird plan,

02:43.931 --> 02:45.430
but let's drink to it--
who's in?

02:45.432 --> 02:46.932
No, come on, I got to study
for my interview.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.935
Oh, I would, man, but I got a
lot of police stuff to study.

02:49.937 --> 02:50.936
You know, like, roads,

02:50.938 --> 02:52.771
laws, bullets...

02:52.773 --> 02:54.273
Be really nice if you guys
spent some time

02:54.275 --> 02:57.276
and studied your friend Nick.
Pop quiz, hotshots.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.278
I miss you guys.
I don't understand

02:59.280 --> 03:01.446
what you're saying, man.
Are you asking me a question?

03:01.448 --> 03:04.116
For real, though, I miss you.
So we would just sit
around and drink all day?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.951
Aw, forget it, man!
I'm storming off.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.452
(phone rings)

03:07.454 --> 03:09.321
Oh!

03:09.323 --> 03:12.224
Good morning,
Vice Principal Day speaking.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.059
What...? Calm down!

03:14.061 --> 03:16.061
What?! Coach?!

03:16.063 --> 03:17.563
(whispering):
Coach...

03:17.565 --> 03:19.565
are you sleeping
with the school nurse?

03:19.567 --> 03:20.899
Jess, are you crazy?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.067
Of course I'm sleeping
with the school nurse.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.735
What?
- Mazel tov.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.004
My man. Much respect.
Look at you getting up in there.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.006
Yeah. Living the dream.
Great.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.908
That's really hot, dude.
That's really great. For me.

03:29.910 --> 03:33.512
We have to fill out a form
declaring our relationship?

03:33.514 --> 03:35.414
Yes, it's a legal thing.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.916
We're just covering our asses.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.651
While you uncover yours.

03:41.854 --> 03:42.988
Sorry, that was
an unfortunate joke.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.089
(nervous laugh)

03:44.091 --> 03:46.692
Um, anyway, uh,
how did this start?

03:46.694 --> 03:48.594
Uh, fine. A couple
of weeks ago I got a cut.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.928
Mm-hmm.
- And I went to the nurse.

03:49.930 --> 03:52.864
Okay.
- And when I saw her,
I was like, "damn."

03:52.866 --> 03:55.834
And I was, like,
"You frickin' got a cut."

03:55.836 --> 03:57.903
And I was like,
"You frickin' better fix it."

03:57.905 --> 03:59.838
And she was like,
"No. Cuts are gross."

03:59.840 --> 04:01.840
Yeah.
- And then we had sex.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.008
Yeah.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.009
That's disturbing

04:04.011 --> 04:05.410
On so many levels.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.945
Um, I'm sorry, but your outfit

04:06.947 --> 04:08.914
looks like you got it
at a Halloween store.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.283
Thank you.
Coach got it for me.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.952
It's a child's medium.
(giggles)

04:13.954 --> 04:15.854
What'd you put for "nature of
relationship"-- "girlfriend"?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.623
Well, that's what I actually
wanted to talk to you about.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.524
'Cause, uh,
we hadn't...
- Question mark?

04:19.526 --> 04:21.426
Um, it didn't feel like
a question mark when

04:21.428 --> 04:24.463
you put a calamari on my finger
like an engagement ring.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.964
That didn't seem like
a question mark to you?

04:25.966 --> 04:28.200
It's squid.
Jess, someone's
in my parking spot again.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.201
Not now, Rose.

04:29.203 --> 04:30.435
Hey, Ernie.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.970
Hey.
- Last night was really fun.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.106
I found your
swim trunks.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.942
They're ruined.
Really fun.
- Ah, come on. Yeah?

04:36.944 --> 04:37.943
I thought you

04:37.945 --> 04:39.645
ditched this bitch.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.613
I will send your weave
right back to the loom!

04:41.615 --> 04:42.914
Oh, no, no.
- Guys...

04:42.916 --> 04:44.449
Excuse me?
- Oh, yeah!
- Ladies, stop.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.817
(both arguing at once)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.952
See what you did?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.388
This is a different form.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.659
(phone ringing)
- (groans)

04:57.997 --> 04:58.997
All right.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.899
(ringing continues)
Settle down, I'm coming.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.336
Hello?

05:04.338 --> 05:06.438
No, Schmidt's not here.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.273
No one's here.
I'm here by myself.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.842
Because I work at night,
which means I'm probably

05:10.844 --> 05:12.944
the one who should answer
the phone during the day.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.013
Great, yeah, I'll tell him.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.218
(groans, sighs)

05:23.756 --> 05:26.558
(phone rings)

05:27.660 --> 05:29.728
(groans)

05:33.966 --> 05:36.768
What? I'm busy.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.837
Winston's not here.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.307
Really?

05:42.309 --> 05:44.109
Uh-huh. Okay, I'll pass it on.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.110
Okay, you too.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.778
My gentlemen, I'm glad

05:46.780 --> 05:47.779
you're home.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.014
I got your messages.

05:50.483 --> 05:53.485
All right,
here you go.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.954
Wow. Are these
alphabetized?
Yeah, you're welcome.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.290
I felt like a secretary.
It was pretty awesome.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.125
Some auto body shop
called, Schmidt--

06:00.127 --> 06:01.893
apparently you're
getting a spoiler?

06:01.895 --> 06:03.061
I'm not getting a sp...

06:03.063 --> 06:04.896
I just wanted a quote.
Yeah, I get a quote

06:04.898 --> 06:06.565
just in case I do want
to actually buy one.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.734
And it's nice
to have a price before

06:08.736 --> 06:11.903
you get emotionally invested.
It's called predicting desires.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.072
What I wish I would have said
is when I first said it--

06:14.074 --> 06:16.742
"Spoiler alert."

06:16.744 --> 06:19.845
I wish it... When I...
I wish I would have said, um,

06:19.847 --> 06:21.079
"You're getting a spoiler--
spoiler alert."

06:21.081 --> 06:22.848
I don't think that
would have helped.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.915
I just... I'm just
getting a quote, okay?

06:23.917 --> 06:24.983
It's really none
of your business.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.585
Definitely noted.
Thanks, my man.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.854
For the...
Winston, uh...

06:28.856 --> 06:30.355
who's this gal Judy?

06:30.357 --> 06:32.023
I've never heard of her.
She called twice.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.925
Who is this woman?
- (chuckles)
She's nobody.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.695
Doesn't sound like nobody.
Where'd you guys meet?

06:36.697 --> 06:37.929
At the driving range.
The driving range?

06:37.931 --> 06:40.699
But you don't golf.
Uh, I like to watch?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.902
Winston, you go to the driving
range just to watch?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.170
Yeah.
- Very strange,
very strange.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.738
Let's get back
to this Judy character,

06:46.740 --> 06:49.074
because I am
interested.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.076
You made love to her yet?
I don't know.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.278
Leave me alone, dude.
Honestly, stop.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.781
That's not even a big d--
I don't even like her
that much, all right?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.949
Just, ugh. I'm probably
gonna dump her.
Do you want to talk about it?

06:57.951 --> 07:00.619
Just kidding.
I'm messing with you.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.954
Are you guys having as much fun
as I'm having right now?

07:02.956 --> 07:06.291
This landline has really brought
us together in a great way.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.959
I miss this.
Hey, if I cooked up

07:07.961 --> 07:10.028
a whole chicken,
would you guys have some?

07:12.031 --> 07:14.099
Those look like two
hungry faces-- (chuckles)

07:16.769 --> 07:18.870
Wow. That was intrusive.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.207
Winston, how do you not know
if you'd made love to someone?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.475
I'm mad at you, Jess.

07:23.477 --> 07:24.976
Why'd you put me
on blast like that?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.313
Because you shouldn't be
sleeping with other
teachers, Coach,

07:28.315 --> 07:29.648
let alone two.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.817
Who are you, Blanche
from<i> Golden Girls?</i>

07:31.819 --> 07:33.585
Honestly, it took me
a while to figure out

07:33.587 --> 07:35.420
who I was in that school,
but I finally did.

07:35.422 --> 07:37.923
Who?
- I'm the guy who has
sex with everyone.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.925
Why can't you be the guy
who loves recycling?!

07:39.927 --> 07:43.662
Everyone loves that guy.
This is a school.
It's a sexy place, Jess.

07:43.664 --> 07:46.097
Look at that CPR poster.
It's hot as crap.
- What the...?

07:46.099 --> 07:49.935
Why aren't they wearing shirts?
Are they drinking wine?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.102
Mm...
- That's it!

07:51.104 --> 07:53.939
I'm gonna need to talk
to all these teachers.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.274
You're just jealous because
you're not gettin' any.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.677
(indignant gasp)
When's the last time
someone gave<i> you</i> CPR?

07:58.679 --> 08:00.512
Well, I give it to myself
at least once a month...

08:00.514 --> 08:01.613
Oh!
- to refresh.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.949
I'm talking about real CPR!

08:03.951 --> 08:06.017
Oh.
- Look, you work in a school.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.253
You need to have boundaries.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.589
You have to be a professional.

08:10.591 --> 08:11.923
Ah, Miss Day.
- Oh.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.592
There's someone here
I'd like you to meet.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.826
Oh!
- This is Ryan.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.095
He's gonna be taking over
the science class.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.964
Now, don't be alarmed,

08:18.966 --> 08:20.932
but his voice is gonna sound
kind of funny.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.435
It's because he's British.

08:23.437 --> 08:25.937
Say something to her.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.273
Hello.
Pleased to meet you.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.109
Ah. Oh, charming. Hi.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.144
It's a... How do you do?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.680
You must be, um...
Mister...

08:38.784 --> 08:41.119
"Gos... Gosin-yure."

08:41.121 --> 08:42.621
It's pronounced "Goes-in-you."

08:42.623 --> 08:44.122
Goes-in-who?

08:44.124 --> 08:45.123
It "goes in you," Jess.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.126
Goes in me.
Goes in... Jess. What!?

08:48.128 --> 08:51.062
I'm sorry, I'm gonna make a
note of how to pronounce it.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.231
It's really nice
to meet you, Mr. Goes-in...

08:53.233 --> 08:55.233
Ryan.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.902
COACH: Hey, Jess,
where you going?

08:56.904 --> 09:00.071
You forgot to tell him
about boundaries!

09:00.073 --> 09:02.073
It's great having you here,
Mr. Goes-in-you.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.909
Geauxinue.
Yeah. Goes-in-you, Goes-in-you.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.644
No...
Goes in all of us.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.145
Yeah.
- Sooner or later.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.017
(phone buzzes)
This is Schmidt.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.819
Hey, it's Nick.
Let me get Winston.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.023
Winnie the Bish, you on?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.858
What is happening right now?

09:19.860 --> 09:22.027
I'm just giving you guys
your midday update.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.995
Schmidt,
dry-cleaner company called.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.031
Your socks are ready.
SCHMIDT:
Oh, great.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.166
Not quite sure why we need to be
on a conference call for this.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.035
Not quite sure why you need
to dry-clean your socks,

09:30.037 --> 09:33.004
you weirdo,
but we'll get back to that.

09:33.006 --> 09:34.839
Winston, Judy called<i> again.</i>

09:34.841 --> 09:37.075
And so, I told her
you weren't feeling it.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.911
(laughs)
Now why would you do that?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.413
You said
you were gonna dump her.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.782
It was a very difficult
conversation for you.

09:43.784 --> 09:46.851
We all know how you are, so I
just handled it. You're welcome.

09:46.853 --> 09:49.020
Hey, Nick, do I need to be
on for this? Can I get off?
WINSTON: Great, great, great.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.188
You know what? Now she's gonna
do something crazy.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.790
You know, this is a very
emotional woman

09:51.792 --> 09:53.124
we're dealing with, all right?

09:53.126 --> 09:54.960
That bitch a Leo!
Can I go now?

09:54.962 --> 09:56.628
You should have thought of that
before you dumped her.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.629
I didn't! You did!

09:57.631 --> 09:58.630
Because that's what you wanted.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.965
I don't know what I want!

09:59.967 --> 10:01.933
Judy didn't know
what you wanted, either!

10:01.935 --> 10:03.969
Oh, and Schmidt,
the magazine called.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.438
Oh.
And they need a picture.
But don't worry. I handled it.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.973
What do you mean,
you handled it?

10:07.975 --> 10:09.140
I know you have a lot
on your plate,

10:09.142 --> 10:10.875
so don't worry...

10:10.877 --> 10:12.777
I sent them the most recent
picture I had.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.979
The most recent one?
WINSTON:
Did Judy sound...?

10:13.981 --> 10:15.947
Winston, enough!
Nick, what, what do you mean by

10:15.949 --> 10:17.983
"the most recent"? I don't...
I don't understand what that...

10:17.985 --> 10:19.951
The latest picture.
It's the most accurate.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.952
It's just good marketing.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.420
You know that.
Check your e-mail.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.421
You'll be happy.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.923
Did you check it?

10:24.925 --> 10:27.592
Is it loaded?

10:27.594 --> 10:30.161
Oh, no, no, no!

10:30.163 --> 10:32.097
And that's all I got.
You guys good?

10:32.099 --> 10:33.665
(Schmidt sighs)

10:33.667 --> 10:35.100
Okay, I'll check back in five.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.836
What? Five... five what?
Nick? Five minutes?!

10:37.838 --> 10:40.071
¶ I'm a very good secretary. ¶

10:42.174 --> 10:45.010
(phone buzzing)
Hello.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.344
Yeah.
Hello.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.613
Yeah...
¶ Hello. ¶

10:48.615 --> 10:50.281
Yo!
Hello.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.018
Yo...
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hello.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.120
Yo!
What up? What up? What up?

10:55.122 --> 10:56.121
Winston!
Hello.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.322
I said... Winston I said "Yo."

10:57.324 --> 10:59.324
Wait. Who's this?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.760
It's Schmidt! We got to do
something about Nick.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.995
We're here to address
the school policies

11:03.997 --> 11:06.097
on interfaculty relations.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.933
Some forms of touching, say,

11:08.935 --> 11:10.935
a... a friendly handshake,

11:10.937 --> 11:13.938
or a spirited pat,
are completely appropriate.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.774
MAN:
What if you
spill coffee

11:15.776 --> 11:17.275
on your pants,
and you're very burnt,

11:17.277 --> 11:19.277
and upon getting your pants
cut off by paramedics,

11:19.279 --> 11:21.112
you become aroused?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.814
I'm truly hoping
that didn't happen.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.949
What if you're in a situation
where you either have to
Um...

11:24.951 --> 11:26.951
grab a teacher's crotch,

11:26.953 --> 11:29.954
or give narcotics to a student?

11:29.956 --> 11:31.823
That's a great question, man.
Thanks, friend.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.491
Not a great question.
And what if you...?

11:33.493 --> 11:35.794
I'm done with you.
If you feel things getting

11:35.796 --> 11:37.962
sexual...

11:37.964 --> 11:40.298
just say, "Shut it down!"

11:40.300 --> 11:44.903
Followed by a sweeping gesture
with your hands, like such.

11:44.905 --> 11:47.906
Everyone do it with me.
Shut it down!

11:47.908 --> 11:50.308
No, thanks.
- It's kind of fun.
Shut it down.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.744
Shut it... down.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.046
Thank... thank you, new guy.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.918
Yes, Coach.
- See, I'm more of
a visual learner.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.319
(laughing):
Oh, yeah, you are.
Do you think you could

12:01.321 --> 12:03.421
maybe demonstrate
that move in context?

12:03.423 --> 12:06.324
Really, Coach?
I think we'd all like that.
It's kind of like a...

12:06.326 --> 12:07.325
like a skit.
- What?!
- (overlapping chatter)

12:07.327 --> 12:08.860
No idea.
Visual learning.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.861
Like a skit.
- ALL:
Visual learning.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.863
Visual learning.

12:11.865 --> 12:14.099
Show us! Do it!
ALL:
Visual learning!

12:14.101 --> 12:15.266
Okay, Coach, do you want
to come up and help me?

12:15.268 --> 12:17.268
How about the new guy?

12:17.270 --> 12:19.504
British people love
doing stuff, right?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.008
No, I don't think...

12:24.010 --> 12:25.910
British guy...
doing stuff!
WOMAN:
Yeah.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.112
British guy doing stuff!

12:27.114 --> 12:29.080
I'm telling you
they don't like to do things.

12:29.082 --> 12:32.517
Doing stuff!
- (all chanting)
The British are coming!

12:32.519 --> 12:35.086
Okay, okay.
- Happy to help.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.155
(applause and cheering)

12:40.192 --> 12:44.462
Mr... "Guzinya" and I will now
act out a sexual scenario.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.097
It's "Goes-in-you."

12:46.099 --> 12:47.532
Yeah. I know.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.939
Okay, let's try it again.
All right,
all right.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.442
(beep)
- Hello. You've
reached the loft.
- Oh, my God!

12:57.444 --> 12:59.110
What?
- Too sexy!

12:59.112 --> 13:00.979
Sounds good to me.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.547
Are you out of your mind?
I'm on fire right now.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.115
This is a home.
We're not selling lubricant.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.917
Why aren't one of
you doing this?

13:05.919 --> 13:07.085
Because we couldn't
decide which of us

13:07.087 --> 13:08.419
to do it, and this way,
it's fair.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.088
Put nothing on it.
Flat as can be.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.923
All right, here we go.
Flat as can be.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.826
Just say the words.
(beep)

13:14.828 --> 13:16.261
(flatly): Hello.
You've reached the loft.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.829
Oh, my God!

13:17.831 --> 13:20.832
Will you not stop until
the whole world is aroused?!

13:20.834 --> 13:22.167
CECE:
Okay.
- Hey.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.669
Nick, my man, looking good.
There he is.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.271
New set of PJs?
I know what
you're doing.

13:26.273 --> 13:29.507
You're blowing hot air up
in between my butt cheeks.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.178
And I'm no idiot.
I know I was let go 'cause of

13:33.180 --> 13:36.114
the dang old machine.
Story as old as time.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.016
A new piece of technology
comes around,

13:38.018 --> 13:40.118
and all the peasants freak out.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.453
But one prince knows
what's going on,

13:42.455 --> 13:45.523
and he says, "Don't trust
the technology!"

13:45.525 --> 13:47.492
And all you peasants trust it,

13:47.494 --> 13:50.094
and then the machine
becomes self-aware

13:50.096 --> 13:52.263
and destroys you all.

13:52.265 --> 13:55.099
And then, I become the
loneliest prince of all,

13:55.101 --> 13:57.435
laughing in my golden tower.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.971
(laughs)
Isn't that a movie?

13:59.973 --> 14:02.273
Maybe I stole that
from<i> War Games,</i> yeah.
<i>Short Circuit.</i>

14:02.275 --> 14:05.276
No, it isn't.
- Man, you know
what's a good movie?<i> Splash.</i>

14:05.278 --> 14:06.945
I don't know what is happening.
(phone ringing)

14:06.947 --> 14:08.313
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.981
Let's see what
she can do.
- (beep)

14:09.983 --> 14:12.116
CECE (flatly):
Hello. You've reached the loft.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.986
SCHMIDT:
Oh, my God. Will you not stop
until the whole world is aro...?

14:14.988 --> 14:16.120
(beep)

14:16.122 --> 14:17.956
WOMAN:
Hey, this message is for Nick.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.959
You responded to my ad about
a custom secretary headset.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.461
Please give me a call back.
(beep)

14:23.463 --> 14:26.197
How do they know my name?
It's a stinking old prank.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.967
I don't even care.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.569
I got a lot going on
today, so...

14:31.571 --> 14:33.071
Are you just eating
a bowl of jelly?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.973
What does it look like?
- It looks
like a bowl of jelly.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.975
It's a bowl of jelly, yeah.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.509
Okay, so say I'm in the library

14:38.511 --> 14:41.579
and I feel Mr. G.'s hands
on my shoulders.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.081
I'm not interested.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.249
So what do I do?

14:44.251 --> 14:47.085
I say, "Shut it down."

14:47.087 --> 14:49.587
Does that make things
more clear for you?

14:49.589 --> 14:51.689
I feel like it needs to
be a little more real,
you know what I mean?

14:51.691 --> 14:54.592
I feel like if he were
to touch her, that would
help, am I right?

14:54.594 --> 14:57.262
(others agreeing)
Am I crazy for thinking that?
No, right? Yeah. Just...

14:57.264 --> 15:00.865
It'll be more helpful
if he were to touch her.
Just touch her, man.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.033
Yeah, he should touch her.
Touch her!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.868
Get in there!
Touch her.

15:03.870 --> 15:06.037
Okay, fine. Um...

15:06.039 --> 15:10.508
So I'm in the library and,
uh, Ryan approaches...

15:10.510 --> 15:13.111
Hello. You look tense.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.079
(oohing)
With that accent.

15:15.081 --> 15:15.914
Oh!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.348
(everyone murmuring
sensually)

15:17.350 --> 15:18.750
Mmm...

15:18.752 --> 15:19.951
Sha, na, na.

15:19.953 --> 15:23.588
Mmm... Day-O.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.590
A little lower.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.958
Right in the wolf patch.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.126
(puzzled murmuring)
Huh? What?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.594
Should I shut it down?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.096
What? Yes. Yes!

15:32.098 --> 15:33.097
Shut it down!
(groans)

15:33.099 --> 15:34.299
(all gasping)

15:34.301 --> 15:35.433
I touched your... I...
That was...

15:35.435 --> 15:36.634
That's fine. It's-it's cool.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.870
Nice to meet you, too.
(laughter)

15:38.872 --> 15:41.372
That was an accident.
And when an accident happens,

15:41.374 --> 15:42.607
shut it down.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.641
(cheering, laughter)

15:43.643 --> 15:46.110
I did it again.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.378
That's what I'm
talking about!

15:49.782 --> 15:53.351
I think we need to
fill out some forms.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.155
Why won't these
messages play, Winston?

15:57.157 --> 15:59.424
The machine's on the fritz.
Just don't tell Nick.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.658
The magazine was supposed
to call today

16:00.660 --> 16:02.093
and set up my interview.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.661
I'm as mad as a dad in traffic!

16:03.663 --> 16:05.496
You probably burnt it out.
I mean, you listened

16:05.498 --> 16:07.165
to Cece's message 100 times.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.900
I know. Then I touched my peen.

16:09.668 --> 16:11.836
(scatting cheerily)

16:11.838 --> 16:13.004
There he is.

16:13.006 --> 16:15.506
All right, Nick, hey,
uh, you were home today.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.842
Did anybody leave any messages
about my interview for tomorrow?
I don't know.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.345
Why don't you ask the machine?
Isn't that what you wanted?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.113
(chuckles)
Uh, the machine's not working.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.682
Isn't that funny? I feel like
I'm working perfectly.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.753
I'm gonna go take this machine
back to 1993 and exchange it.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.457
Knock, knock.

16:32.459 --> 16:35.593
Who's there?
The magazine. They called.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.594
They left a message.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.096
They want to do
the interview today.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.263
Why didn't you say anything?

16:39.265 --> 16:41.099
That thing is super
important to him.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.434
You know how much this interview
meant to him.
Yeah, I know. I know. Yeah.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.270
First you break up with Judy
and now this?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.272
Why are you so obsessed
with answering the phone?

16:48.274 --> 16:50.108
Man.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.642
We're just peeling the onion

16:51.644 --> 16:53.111
all the way to the middle,
aren't we?

16:53.113 --> 16:54.278
What's going on?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.813
Just because I miss you guys.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.449
And I didn't know what was
going on with your lives

16:58.451 --> 17:02.153
and now I do, and it-it
made me feel connected to you.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.956
I'm not gonna lie to you, man,
that got me.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.291
(phone rings)

17:07.293 --> 17:08.960
Hello? This is Nick.

17:08.962 --> 17:12.497
No, I'm sorry.
Schmidt isn't here.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.701
No, he didn't... Pl... H...
Can you hold on one second?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.236
(quietly):
It's the magazine.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.570
They want to cancel
the interview.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.839
What?
They want to do it right
now or not at all.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.475
Yeah, this is Nick again.
No, he-he did... He might...

17:24.477 --> 17:25.643
Hold on one second.
I hear something.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.311
That might be him.
Please hold.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.814
(quietly):
You've got to talk to 'em.
Why do I have to talk?

17:29.816 --> 17:31.249
Because even though
you're the most awkward
person I've ever met,

17:31.251 --> 17:32.850
you're magic on the
phone and you know it.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.185
You know, I put those days
behind me...

17:34.187 --> 17:36.521
Schmidt's right here.
Hold one sec.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.522
(quietly):
You have to do it.

17:37.524 --> 17:39.057
For Schmidt.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.260
I need a soda, I need a straw

17:42.262 --> 17:44.395
and I need to get horizontal,
so get out of my way.

17:46.765 --> 17:48.833
(grunts)

17:50.102 --> 17:51.769
(exhales deeply)

17:51.771 --> 17:54.772
Yeah, this is Schmidt. What up?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.279
Mmm, let's see, the last book
I read. The last book I read.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.282
Good question, good question.
Uh, some biography
with, uh, Carson Daly.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.783
The one with
the red cover.
- Oh.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.252
Yes, that Carson Daly joint.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.121
You know, I respect that dude.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.023
Yeah, he's just like me.
He's always on.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.791
There's not a lot of good
white role models out there,

18:13.793 --> 18:16.427
and I say that as a white man.

18:16.429 --> 18:19.931
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Yeah, you got it,<i> Business, Man!</i>

18:19.933 --> 18:21.866
Is that the magazine?
What are you boobs do...
Yes.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.434
What are you... Winston,
get off the phone.
Stop, stop, stop. Stop.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.469
Shh!

18:24.471 --> 18:26.137
Trust us.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.806
What does
marketing mean to Schmidt?

18:28.808 --> 18:31.209
This was the spoiler.
What did it say? Uh...

18:31.211 --> 18:33.211
Predicting desires.
Predicting desires.

18:33.213 --> 18:36.314
Well, to me, it's all
about predicting desires

18:36.316 --> 18:40.718
and finding buyers, you feel me?
(chuckles)

18:40.720 --> 18:41.886
He's really good
on the phone.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.121
Did you know
that my name was an acronym?

18:43.123 --> 18:45.156
Uh-huh. Schmidt:

18:45.158 --> 18:46.591
Some Can Have Money,

18:46.593 --> 18:48.593
I Desire Thoughtfulness.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.995
(Winston laughs)

18:50.997 --> 18:52.997
Schmidt don't quit!

18:52.999 --> 18:54.932
Hey, Coach.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.768
Hey.
- I just came in here
to say I'm sorry.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.270
Sometimes it's...

18:59.272 --> 19:01.105
hard to control your feelings.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.508
Which I demonstrated by...

19:03.510 --> 19:06.677
grabbing a man's "dujeels"
in front of the entire faculty.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.113
Well, I'm sorry for putting you
in a position

19:09.115 --> 19:12.016
to grab that man's "dujeels."

19:12.018 --> 19:14.118
I don't like saying "dujeels."
It's weird.

19:14.120 --> 19:17.955
I call mine my Sam Jackson
'cause he's in everything.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.957
I just don't know
how to face Ryan again.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.293
I was so unprofessional.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.794
Jess, you're the vice principal,

19:23.796 --> 19:25.263
and you're
a great vice principal.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.931
Doesn't mean you're
not a human being.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.166
Thanks.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.935
Oh...
and you'll be happy to know

19:30.937 --> 19:32.270
I've repealed the policy.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.772
Oh.
- You have?

19:34.774 --> 19:36.941
That's frickin' awesome.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.609
Ruth.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.611
Hi. It's hot under there.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.614
Happy to know
you two have patched things up.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.116
Yeah, we have.
Oh, they've been patched.

19:45.118 --> 19:46.117
(both laughing)

19:46.119 --> 19:47.485
Two times.

19:47.487 --> 19:48.986
I see your hand moving, and I...

19:48.988 --> 19:50.988
wish you'd wait
till I left the room.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.057
RUTH:
My bad.

19:53.992 --> 19:55.793
Hey.
(chuckles)

19:55.795 --> 19:56.961
Hi.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.963
Hi. Sorry.
Um, my hands are...

19:58.965 --> 20:00.865
staying behind my back,
don't worry.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.501
I won't even look at it.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.304
I mean, I-I looked at it
just 'cause I said it, but I...

20:06.306 --> 20:09.574
(chuckles)
- Uh... hmm, yeah.
I was gonna ask you...

20:09.576 --> 20:10.908
FOSTER:
Vice Principal?

20:10.910 --> 20:12.009
A moment, please?

20:12.011 --> 20:13.010
I'm so sorry.
Don't be sorry.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.412
Um, my boss.
Good seeing you.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.647
I'll, uh, see you around.
I hope so.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.750
Principal Foster, I am

20:19.752 --> 20:21.319
so sorry. I went overboard.

20:21.321 --> 20:24.155
First off, it's "dog."
Dog.

20:24.157 --> 20:25.990
Secondly, do not apologize.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.427
I have tried to corral
these animals myself.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.662
It's impossible.
- Word.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.832
These teachers
are straight-up ho's, dog.

20:34.834 --> 20:37.835
Sometimes you just got to let
people follow their urges.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.606
Yes.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.441
I completely agree.

20:43.443 --> 20:44.842
It's too bad we can't.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.043
We can't?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.713
Absolutely not.
We're administrators, B.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.249
This is a lawsuit
waiting to happen.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.784
Two administrators?
Perfectly fine.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.188
But, unfortunately,
as I've repeatedly told you,

20:57.190 --> 20:59.023
I'm not attracted to you.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.525
Right. You like Asians.
So... Exactly.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.961
So that's off the table.
- Yeah.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.630
So, do us both a favor...

21:05.632 --> 21:08.032
lock up that lobster.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.704
(sighs)

21:15.540 --> 21:17.141
SCHMIDT:
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

21:17.143 --> 21:18.643
Look at that.
"Bringing Nasty Back."

21:18.645 --> 21:20.044
NICK:
"The bad boy of marketing."

21:20.046 --> 21:21.946
That is cool.
So great for my brand.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.948
I mean, I always knew I was
a bad boy, but now it's in print

21:23.950 --> 21:25.883
and it's official.
Don't call yourself a bad boy.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.885
Am I a bad boy?
You're not a bad boy.
