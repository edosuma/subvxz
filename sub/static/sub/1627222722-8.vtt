00:11.845 --> 00:13.472
Now hear this.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.643
Now hear this.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.187
Now hear this.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.357
Here we are together.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.280
"There was no way of telling
when the ship would come back for us.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.659
Until it did,
we were alone upon the island.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.994
Ramo, therefore,
would have to become a man

00:36.078 --> 00:40.123
sooner than if we were not alone,
since I would need his help in many ways."

00:41.166 --> 00:42.584
Should I keep going?

00:44.503 --> 00:46.421
I think that's actually
all the time we have.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.674
But that was really great reading.
Thank you, Mandy.

00:52.094 --> 00:54.263
All right, well, congratulations.

00:54.346 --> 00:57.724
You all made it through
your first week of school from home.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.019
I know it's really weird.

01:01.103 --> 01:06.942
So, just wanna say thank you for,
you know, showing up and paying attention.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.153
You guys are killing it, and…

01:11.530 --> 01:12.614
I miss you.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.246
Yeah. Stay safe. Have a great weekend.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.124
Or great as it can be.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.334
And I'll see you Monday.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.502
Bye, Mr. Corman.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.630
Bye, Ramon.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.715
Hey.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.799
Yo.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.389
Sorry. D-- Do you mind
just taking off your shoes?

02:19.932 --> 02:21.433
I'm about to hop into the shower.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.601
-Yeah.
-My shoes--

02:22.684 --> 02:25.187
It's just the soles of shoes. It--

02:25.270 --> 02:27.773
-'Cause the virus falls to the ground, so…
-Yep. Yeah, it's fine.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.192
-I just read this whole thing.
-No problem.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.401
Thanks for getting dinner.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.153
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

04:49.498 --> 04:50.499
-Yo.
-Hey.

04:54.044 --> 04:55.671
You've put the Carl's on a plate?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.340
Yeah. I was…

04:58.423 --> 05:01.176
-reading this article about take-out and…
-Right.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.304
-Oh! Oh, God. Dude, what the fu--
-Sorry, I--

05:04.888 --> 05:07.182
-Did you-- What, did you microwave these?
-Yeah.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.185
There's lettuce and tomato in there, man.
You can't microwave lettuce and tomato!

05:10.269 --> 05:11.562
No, I-- I know. I know.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.064
No, you gotta take out the veggies
and then you toast the bread

05:14.147 --> 05:16.984
-and then you put the meat in a pan.
-You m-microwave everything…

05:17.067 --> 05:19.319
so that you kill anything
that might be on it.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.947
-Wow. Shit.
-Yeah.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.825
Sorry, this is just
my exact nightmare, so…

05:24.908 --> 05:27.160
Yeah, I know.
It's-- Yeah, it's cool.

05:27.244 --> 05:29.705
Ju-- Just gonna put these in the freezer
for a second.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.794
So are you just gonna, like,
keep going to work?

05:37.588 --> 05:38.797
It's UPS, man.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.134
We move 6% of the country's entire GDP
every day.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.262
I mean, if you really wanna
bone the economy, you shut down UPS.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.056
Yeah, I guess, I was just, you know…

05:48.140 --> 05:50.934
The schools are shut down,
the NBA shut down--

05:51.018 --> 05:54.938
Yeah, they were never gonna shut down UPS.
Told you that, like, a week ago.

05:56.982 --> 05:57.983
Should be good.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.987
How did you know that,
like, a week ago?

06:02.070 --> 06:03.238
How did you not know that?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.575
People need their shit.
Who's gonna take it?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.330
-Thanks.
-Yep.

06:20.506 --> 06:21.507
Wow.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.717
That is really bad.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.427
Sorry.

06:29.598 --> 06:34.811
So, are they, like,
taking any measures or…

06:34.895 --> 06:35.896
Like what?

06:37.189 --> 06:38.482
Giving you masks or…

06:39.233 --> 06:41.485
They say masks don't really do anything.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.445
It just makes people feel safer
by wearing something,

06:43.529 --> 06:45.781
-but that they don't really do anything.
-Who says that?

06:45.864 --> 06:48.158
The government, right?
You didn't hear that?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.536
-Yeah, I did hear that.
-Yeah.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.832
But are people standing further apart or--

06:55.916 --> 06:58.043
-I'm not gonna live in fear, dude, okay?
-I'm not saying

06:58.126 --> 07:00.003
-you should live in fear.
-I'm not gonna live in fear.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.923
Just, you know, acknowledge the reality.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.592
The reality.
Okay, what's the reality then?

07:06.969 --> 07:09.346
What is it? No, let's go through it.
What's the reality?

07:10.722 --> 07:14.977
I'm just saying I-- I'm not sure it's safe

07:15.060 --> 07:17.771
for you to be going to work
every day right now.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.190
Safe for me or safe for you?

07:22.317 --> 07:23.318
Either one.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.028
Right. Got it. Okay.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.989
So what do you suggest I do about it?

07:27.739 --> 07:29.741
-What do you think I should do?
-I don't know.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.871
Well, I'm sorry I can't just stay at home
and collect a paycheck.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.623
That didn't work out as well for me
as it did for you, buddy.

07:36.707 --> 07:37.708
Dude, I'm just--

07:37.791 --> 07:40.335
Do you know what happens
if I stop going to work? Do you?

07:40.878 --> 07:41.879
For Gabi--

07:41.962 --> 07:44.298
But do you know what happens
if you get this virus?

07:44.381 --> 07:45.424
-Yeah, I do.
-No, you don't.

07:45.507 --> 07:46.508
-Yeah, I do.
-You don't!

07:46.592 --> 07:48.427
Yeah, I'll get sick
and then I'll probably get better.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.678
-You don't know that.
-Yeah, I do.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.514
-No, you-- you don't know anything.
-I don't know anything?

07:53.432 --> 07:55.475
-That's not what I meant, dude. I'm--
-Do you hear yourself?

07:55.559 --> 07:56.560
I'm saying it's so new.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.687
If there's an ignorant person here,
it's not me, it's you.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.480
Nobody knows anything right now,
is what I'm saying.

08:00.564 --> 08:04.318
Right. You just have no fucking idea
how the world works. You don't.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.113
Hey, hey, just chill at home,
don't work for a couple of months.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.157
But do me a favor,
take your shoes off at the door,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.242
and microwave the fuck
out of this cheeseburger,

08:12.326 --> 08:14.161
'cause that's gonna keep us alive, right?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.416
I'm not fucking eating that.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.759
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.011
What's wrong?

08:31.094 --> 08:33.263
I mean, a lot, right?

08:34.515 --> 08:38.183
Well, yeah.
I mean, but besides that, are you okay?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.895
What, is it that obvious?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.813
-Josh, are you okay?
-No, no, no, I'm fine. It's okay.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.441
I'm just worried about Victor.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.818
Why? Is he okay?

08:47.402 --> 08:49.863
Yeah, no, he's not sick or anything.
He's-- Or-- I don't know.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.907
He doesn't have any symptoms.
I just mean he--

08:52.908 --> 08:56.870
He has to keep going to work…
so he can't stay home.

08:57.579 --> 09:01.291
-Right, because he's a-- a--
-Yeah, he's-- Right.

09:01.708 --> 09:05.003
So, yeah, he's…
I'm just worried about him.

09:06.839 --> 09:09.800
Are you worried about him
or you're worried about yourself?

09:11.927 --> 09:14.721
I mean, both. It can be both, right?

09:14.805 --> 09:16.557
Oh, sure. No, sure, of course.

09:18.851 --> 09:20.561
Anyway, I was thinking that…

09:20.644 --> 09:24.314
I should maybe just come back
and stay at the house for a little while.

09:26.525 --> 09:27.943
I mean, if that's okay.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.154
No, of course,
you're more than welcome always.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.949
I just think it-- it's probably…
you know, the smart thing--

09:34.032 --> 09:36.034
Sweetheart,
you don't have to explain yourself.

09:36.118 --> 09:37.870
Just come over whenever you want.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.246
Okay. Thanks.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.039
Of course.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.085
Actually, I-- I was thinking--

09:46.461 --> 09:48.338
Sorry, this might sound weird,
but I was thinking

09:48.422 --> 09:51.300
I should probably just stay in my room
for 14 days.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.594
Well, what do you mean?

09:54.178 --> 09:55.971
I mean, you know, I've been around Victor

09:56.054 --> 09:58.182
and Victor's been around
all these people at work,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.517
and, last thing I want to do
is get you sick.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.312
So, the recommended thing
is that I isolate for 14 days.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.691
Okay, well, if that's what you wanna do.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.152
It's not what I want to do. I--
But I think…

10:10.235 --> 10:12.279
-it's probably the smarter thing--
-You know what I mean.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.363
Okay.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.533
But also…

10:16.617 --> 10:20.245
and let me know if this is
too much of a burden, but I was--

10:20.329 --> 10:22.206
Josh, just tell me what you want me to do.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.290
Okay…

10:24.416 --> 10:29.963
I think that you should probably bring
food to me and leave it outside my door.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.761
Hello?

11:56.341 --> 11:57.718
Josh, is that you?

11:57.801 --> 11:59.094
Yeah. Don't come in!

11:59.178 --> 12:00.679
Okay, I won't.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.974
Hi!

12:04.057 --> 12:05.058
Hi.

12:07.019 --> 12:09.021
Well, I'm-- I'm going to bed now.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.732
Okay. Good night.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.170
Are you up?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.088
Yeah!

12:35.714 --> 12:37.382
Were you serious last night about--

12:37.466 --> 12:40.052
What? Sorry, I just can't hear you.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.470
Well--

12:41.553 --> 12:42.846
Don't come in!

12:42.930 --> 12:44.056
I'm not.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.685
Were you serious last night about,
you know, leaving food by the door?

12:51.355 --> 12:52.356
Yeah.

12:55.943 --> 12:56.944
Is that okay?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.495
"The storm lasted two days,

13:48.579 --> 13:52.165
and the third day, we buried our dead
on the south headland."

13:55.627 --> 13:58.422
"The Aleuts who had
fallen on the beach, we burned."

14:04.428 --> 14:07.097
"For many days after that,
the village was quiet."

14:09.099 --> 14:11.310
"People went out
only to gather food.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.937
And came back to eat in silence."

14:26.366 --> 14:29.244
-Hi! Hi.
-Hi, babe. Hi, hi.

14:29.328 --> 14:30.954
You got a lot!

14:31.038 --> 14:33.081
Well, I got-- Not really.

14:33.165 --> 14:34.541
-What is that?
-What?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.585
-What is that?
-It's a surprise.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.836
Okay.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.798
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.968
Oh, just a minute, I'll get that.

14:45.969 --> 14:47.179
-Hello?
-Hi, Mom.

14:48.013 --> 14:51.808
Oh! Hi. Why are you calling?
Are you still here?

14:51.892 --> 14:54.728
Yep. I just wanted us
to be able to hear each other.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.190
-Oh, okay. Well, I'm kinda--
-Is that-- Who is that?

15:00.651 --> 15:03.403
Mom, someone just came in the door.
Who is it?

15:04.238 --> 15:06.281
-Can I call you back?
-No, this is serious.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.491
You can't just call me back.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.909
-Okay. Thank you.
-Mom. Mo--

15:12.955 --> 15:15.582
We're recalling a few--
a few things…

15:20.546 --> 15:22.089
-Hello.
-Hi, Mom.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.508
-I'm very busy. I'm sorry. I'll call back.
-No, don't-- Don't--

15:24.591 --> 15:26.718
-I can't talk right now. Goodbye.
-Don't do that! Mom! Mom!

15:28.303 --> 15:30.806
-Do you need to take care of something?
-No, no. It's not--

15:34.309 --> 15:37.604
No, really.
Let's get comfortable, all right?

15:46.446 --> 15:49.116
Hello. This is Ruth. You know what to do.

15:50.284 --> 15:54.621
Hi, Mom. It's me. You know it's me.
I'm here in the house. You know I'm here.

15:54.705 --> 15:56.790
Whoever just walked in the door,
they know I'm here.

15:56.874 --> 15:59.042
And if they don't know,
then they should know. Because--

15:59.126 --> 16:01.378
-What is your problem?
-It's not safe what you're doing!

16:01.461 --> 16:02.963
-It is safe.
-No, it's not!

16:03.046 --> 16:05.048
Why do you think I've been sitting here
for the last week?

16:05.132 --> 16:07.718
If someone new is coming in the house,
then they have to isolate.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.012
-It's two weeks. That's the--
-You are in isolation

16:10.095 --> 16:13.724
because you were living with Victor,
and he was going to work.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.893
-Larry has been staying at--
-So it's Larry?

16:16.894 --> 16:17.895
Yes.

16:18.729 --> 16:21.899
And he has been staying at home
for three weeks.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.026
Longer than anyone else I know.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.360
He saw this coming, you know.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.738
He's very intelligent
about this kind of thing.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.699
And we're lucky that he offered
to shelter in place with us.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.783
We're lucky?

16:32.326 --> 16:34.161
-Josh--
-How do you know he's staying at home?

16:34.244 --> 16:35.579
Just 'cause he told you?

16:35.662 --> 16:36.663
Yes.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.333
-And that's good enough for you?
-Yes.

16:42.503 --> 16:43.504
Okay.

16:44.421 --> 16:48.342
Well, I look forward to
hanging out with him,

16:49.218 --> 16:51.929
and you, in about six days.

16:52.679 --> 16:53.680
Great.

16:55.140 --> 16:56.934
Are you done making calls now?

16:57.017 --> 16:59.061
Yep. I'll talk to you la--

17:55.868 --> 17:59.288
And the world just stays the same

17:59.997 --> 18:03.375
People never change

18:03.458 --> 18:07.087
The record keeps replaying

18:14.761 --> 18:18.307
A needle in the groove

18:18.390 --> 18:21.393
A never-ending loop

18:22.186 --> 18:25.355
The things we can't undo

18:33.280 --> 18:36.366
If you know what you're doing

18:37.534 --> 18:44.082
How come you keep doing
It over and over again?

18:44.166 --> 18:45.167
Commas.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.754
A comma's basically just
when you wanna take a pause.

18:49.505 --> 18:52.549
But there are a whole bunch of rules,
and people will say,

18:52.633 --> 18:54.092
"Oh, that's the right place
to put a comma.

18:54.176 --> 18:55.636
That's the wrong place to put a comma."

18:55.719 --> 18:58.222
But those people have never read
Blindness.

19:00.015 --> 19:03.393
It just goes on and on and on
with no periods and tons of commas.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.771
And you know what?
It's wrong, but it's great.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.357
That's one way to go with commas.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.319
Unfortunately, you're gonna be tested
on knowing certain rules

19:12.402 --> 19:14.613
about, kind of, the old-fashioned way
to use commas.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.365
So I'm gonna teach you those rules.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.450
But just know,
when you're writing in real life,

19:18.534 --> 19:20.744
those rules don't really matter that much.

19:22.204 --> 19:25.874
Nothing's gonna change

19:25.958 --> 19:29.628
The record keeps replaying

19:29.711 --> 19:32.464
Round and round again

19:32.548 --> 19:35.050
That is right and it's wrong.

19:35.133 --> 19:38.554
And I think it's really
a matter of opinion.

19:38.637 --> 19:41.974
I'm curious to get some other opinions.
I've been talking a lot.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.017
Anybody else wanna give their opinion?

19:44.101 --> 19:46.061
Anybody else think that
that's right or wrong?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.188
Or somewhere in-between?

19:48.272 --> 19:51.650
-If you know what you're doing
-Hey.

19:52.484 --> 19:55.946
-How come you keep doing
-You awake?

19:56.029 --> 19:59.074
-It over and over again?
-Hey! Wake up!

19:59.825 --> 20:02.536
If you know what you're doing

20:03.412 --> 20:07.332
Dude, what are you doing in my room?
Are you, like, gonna die?

20:07.416 --> 20:09.126
I mean, at some point.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.920
Great. So I die young, but not that young?

20:13.630 --> 20:14.631
I don't know.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.926
What were you listening to?

20:18.468 --> 20:19.720
-You.
-Really?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.388
What song?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.849
I thought you said they weren't songs.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.601
You know what I mean.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.685
Track 12.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.937
That one kinda sucks.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.315
I thought it was pretty good.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.651
Nah, it's just trippy for you 'cause
you haven't heard it in a long time.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.530
I mean, other people liked it too. So…

20:38.989 --> 20:41.200
-Wait. Other people heard it?
-Yeah.

20:42.868 --> 20:46.538
Did you put it out? Like--
Like an early home recordings kinda thing?

20:46.622 --> 20:48.040
No. I just meant, like,

20:49.416 --> 20:52.085
you know,
other people I played it for.

20:52.753 --> 20:53.754
Oh, okay.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.256
Who'd you play it for?

20:57.716 --> 20:59.009
My girlfriend.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.552
Okay.

21:01.512 --> 21:03.889
She wasn't just my girlfriend though.
We were collaborators.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.682
So it was like…

21:08.393 --> 21:09.394
Uh-huh.

21:09.978 --> 21:12.189
-Yeah.
-Did you guys put anything out?

21:12.272 --> 21:13.607
Yep. Kind of.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.400
Can I hear it?

21:16.443 --> 21:18.445
-What, right now?
-I guess, yeah.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.450
Yeah, I'd rather not, if that's cool.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.285
Okay.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.747
-Can I ask you a question though?
-What?

21:29.248 --> 21:31.667
What were you thinking about
when you recorded that?

21:31.750 --> 21:32.835
You don't remember?

21:34.419 --> 21:35.420
Really?

21:36.046 --> 21:37.089
Yeah, no.

21:37.172 --> 21:39.049
That's fucked up. You should.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.468
I'm sorry.

21:42.219 --> 21:43.470
Can I ask you a question?

21:44.596 --> 21:45.597
Yeah.

21:45.681 --> 21:46.849
What are you doing here?

21:49.852 --> 21:53.564
Just… staying safe.

23:14.520 --> 23:15.521
Yes!

23:31.537 --> 23:32.538
No.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.250
Yeah.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.671
Oh, there he is.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.966
Congratulations. You made it through.

23:44.049 --> 23:45.384
Oh, thank you.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.718
How are you feeling?

23:46.802 --> 23:48.512
Well, I still have my sense of smell.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.890
Oh, that's great.
You know, I think it's great what you did.

23:51.974 --> 23:55.686
Not everyone would have
such stick-to-it-iveness.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.312
-Thanks.
-Sit down.

23:58.230 --> 23:59.231
Thank you.

24:05.654 --> 24:06.780
Is that…

24:07.573 --> 24:11.660
Oh, it's just a little something
I worked up. Idle hands, right?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.287
Right.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.413
Well, it…

24:16.456 --> 24:17.916
It really makes a difference.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.586
Thank you. You want some eggs?

24:20.669 --> 24:21.837
Sure. Thank you.

24:30.679 --> 24:31.680
Great, aren't they?

24:32.598 --> 24:33.724
Yeah.

24:34.349 --> 24:36.143
Your mom's great at a lot of things.

24:37.019 --> 24:38.228
She certainly is.

24:40.522 --> 24:41.523
Really good.

24:44.276 --> 24:45.277
Hi, Mom.

24:45.819 --> 24:46.820
Hi.

24:50.115 --> 24:53.327
So, crazy times we're living in, right?

24:55.787 --> 24:57.039
Guess so.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.833
You follow the news much, Josh?

24:59.917 --> 25:01.585
Yeah, probably a little too much.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.713
You look at the real stuff

25:04.796 --> 25:07.633
or do you buy into the mainstream circus
like some people I know?

25:08.467 --> 25:10.511
-Stop.
-No. No.

25:11.220 --> 25:13.764
I love it, babe. I've told you this.

25:14.515 --> 25:16.934
It's relaxing being with you
during this time

25:17.017 --> 25:18.769
because you don't think
about the big things.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.396
You're just content
in your own little world.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.233
And in the end, that's really
the enlightened path.

25:25.359 --> 25:26.527
Being present.

25:31.490 --> 25:36.537
Josh, Larry and I go for walks every day.

25:37.704 --> 25:38.956
Would you like to join us?

25:39.039 --> 25:44.044
You know, I have to get on
with my students in just a little bit. So…

25:45.963 --> 25:46.964
Okay.

25:47.673 --> 25:49.508
Schools are closed,
but we're still teaching.

25:49.591 --> 25:53.136
Well, what time is that? I'm sure
we could work around your schedule.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.555
I'll have to double-check.

25:55.764 --> 25:57.891
How old are the kids you teach again?

25:57.975 --> 25:59.101
They're ten and eleven.

25:59.601 --> 26:01.603
How are they doing with all of this?

26:03.313 --> 26:05.148
You know, they're--
they're mostly just…

26:06.817 --> 26:10.571
content in their own little worlds,
sort of like some people I know.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.155
Josh, goddamn it.

26:15.951 --> 26:18.287
It's okay. It's really-- It's okay.

26:18.871 --> 26:20.122
It's okay.

26:20.205 --> 26:21.248
-It's really--
-Light gray squares.

26:21.331 --> 26:22.332
It's okay.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.834
-This is fantastic…
-It's okay.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.253
-It's really-- It's okay.
-…to, like, instinctively know things.

26:26.336 --> 26:28.213
It's okay.

26:28.297 --> 26:29.798
It's really-- It's okay.

26:29.882 --> 26:32.301
It's okay. It's really--

26:32.384 --> 26:35.470
It's okay. It's really-- It's okay.

26:36.638 --> 26:38.473
-Come on.
-I'm glad you're enjoying it.

26:38.557 --> 26:40.642
-Take a little bit.
-Okay. All right.

26:41.268 --> 26:43.103
Oh, too bitter.

26:43.187 --> 26:46.440
-I don't like it. It's too bitter for me.
-That's what real chocolate tastes like.

26:46.523 --> 26:48.483
I'll just stick with
the good stuff, thanks.

26:48.567 --> 26:51.111
You only think it's good
because it's full of sugar.

26:51.195 --> 26:53.030
No, I think it's good because I like it.

26:53.113 --> 26:59.036
Milk chocolate is objectively a less rich
and nuanced flavor than real cacao.

26:59.620 --> 27:02.122
-Not to me. I'm fine.
-I don't think you know

27:02.206 --> 27:04.791
what the word "objectively" means.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.836
-I think I know what I like--
-You know what though?

27:07.920 --> 27:11.340
That's what I love about you.
It's so cute.

27:12.049 --> 27:15.761
So much to learn.
You'll get there. You'll get there.

27:33.362 --> 27:34.488
-Hey.
-Hi.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.031
Where's Larry?

27:36.907 --> 27:37.908
He's on a call.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.660
Oh. That's nice.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.578
-Why do you have to--
-I didn't mean it like that.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.872
-He's been nothing but--
-Sorry. I just meant that

27:43.956 --> 27:47.918
it's nice that you and I get to sit.
Just you and I.

27:48.001 --> 27:50.546
I mean, we've barely done that at all
this whole time.

27:55.217 --> 27:58.136
I interrupted you though.
He's been nothing but what?

27:58.220 --> 28:00.639
He's been nothing
but kind and courteous to you.

28:01.932 --> 28:02.933
Yeah.

28:03.851 --> 28:04.852
To me, not to you.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.020
-Can we just drop it?
-Okay, sorry.

28:07.104 --> 28:08.939
-Let's talk about something else.
-Great.

28:12.276 --> 28:13.986
-He's passive-aggressive.
-Oh, Jesus.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.530
He belittles you, and then
he pretends like he's not doing it.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.824
-He acts like he's so loving, but really--
-He is loving.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.200
That's not what love is.

28:20.284 --> 28:22.077
Oh, you know so much about what love is?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.663
I know as much as you do.
What, you're some kind of expert?

28:25.330 --> 28:27.374
I'm sorry,
but this is exactly the kind of thing

28:27.457 --> 28:29.459
I would have said to you about Dad
a long time ago…

28:29.543 --> 28:31.670
-He is nothing like your father.
-…and you would have completely dis--

28:31.753 --> 28:33.172
-He's a lot like him.
-He is not.

28:33.255 --> 28:36.133
He manipulates you,
and he makes you feel bad about yourself.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.135
And then you want him
to love you even more

28:38.218 --> 28:40.637
because for some reason
that's what you're attracted to.

28:40.721 --> 28:43.682
Okay. Will you just listen for a second?

28:44.183 --> 28:45.309
Yeah.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.397
I'm not gonna tell you
that Larry is perfect.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.274
That's-- that's not what I'm doing.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.444
I mean, what do--
What do you think this is?

28:55.527 --> 28:56.820
What do I think what is?

28:56.904 --> 28:59.072
This. Nothing is perfect, you know.

28:59.156 --> 29:01.408
I don't know why
that's so hard for you to see.

29:01.491 --> 29:04.995
You're not entitled to the perfect partner
or the perfect life.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.455
You take what you get.

29:06.997 --> 29:08.999
And you're lucky just to be alive.

29:09.082 --> 29:11.293
You have it better
than a lot of other people.

29:11.376 --> 29:13.170
We weren't talking about me.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.546
Yeah, we were.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.465
Well, then you're deflecting.

29:16.548 --> 29:19.259
We were talking about you and Larry.
This isn't about me.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.761
It is about you.

29:20.844 --> 29:23.222
This is what you do. You-- you find fault.

29:23.931 --> 29:26.767
You know?
You look for the worst possible version

29:26.850 --> 29:29.186
so everything's a complete disaster.

29:31.480 --> 29:34.149
-That's what I do?
-Yeah, that's what you do.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.657
I mean, everything is
a complete disaster. Right?

29:41.740 --> 29:42.741
Is it?

29:43.242 --> 29:44.368
Yeah. Look around.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.912
Okay. What am I looking at?

29:47.704 --> 29:48.747
Are you sick?

29:50.332 --> 29:52.292
What?
Oh, they had to close Disneyland.

29:52.376 --> 29:53.502
That's it?

29:53.585 --> 29:55.003
You didn't get to be a rock star?

29:55.087 --> 29:56.088
I didn't say--

29:56.171 --> 29:59.258
Yeah. Well, you know who else
wanted to be a rock star, right?

30:02.135 --> 30:03.136
Yeah.

30:04.263 --> 30:05.264
Okay.

30:06.932 --> 30:08.058
This is where we are.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.564
The question is, what do we do now?

30:27.286 --> 30:29.746
"I held my breath, waiting.

30:30.247 --> 30:32.332
Then I walked across the deck

30:32.416 --> 30:35.794
and, though many hands
tried to hold me back,

30:35.878 --> 30:37.421
flung myself into the sea."

30:51.727 --> 30:55.731
"A wave passed over my head
and I went down and down,

30:56.315 --> 30:58.984
until I thought
I would never behold the day again.

31:02.696 --> 31:06.867
The ship was far away when I rose.
Only the sails showed through the spray.

31:11.872 --> 31:16.668
I was still clutching
the basket that held all of my things,

31:16.752 --> 31:21.507
but it was very heavy and I realized
that I could not swim with it in my arms.

31:28.889 --> 31:32.351
Letting it sink
I started off towards the shore."
