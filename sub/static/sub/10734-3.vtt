Spidermonkey: Don't have to
tell us twice!

13:14.914 --> 13:17.080
Attack!

13:24.119 --> 13:25.020
Attea: No!

13:25.055 --> 13:31.359
[ screeching ]

13:31.395 --> 13:33.027
[ chuckles ]

13:33.063 --> 13:37.264
Oh, my tract!
A rescue! How delightful!

13:47.675 --> 13:52.178
[ screeches ]

[ beeping ]

13:57.251 --> 13:58.684
Ben: [ grunts ]

13:58.719 --> 14:02.186
Attea: Enough monkey
business. Surrender!

14:02.221 --> 14:05.489
Or you'll have a royal mess to clean up.

14:13.385 --> 14:15.652
[ croaks ]

14:15.688 --> 14:16.787
<i>Aah!</i>

14:16.822 --> 14:18.288
<i>Ugh!</i>

14:18.323 --> 14:20.156
[ grunts ]

14:23.059 --> 14:25.193
There sure are a lot of them!

14:25.229 --> 14:28.462
Rook: Yes, perhaps I should
have listened to Ben.

14:28.498 --> 14:30.231
Ben: I should have listened to Rook.

14:30.266 --> 14:33.800
Attea: You heard me. Weapons
down or the queen gets it.

14:33.836 --> 14:39.137
Don't listen to her, boys.
Next to my people, I am nothing.

14:39.173 --> 14:40.872
<i>Attea: Aah!</i>

14:40.908 --> 14:42.540
<i>Mm-mm-mmm!</i>

14:42.575 --> 14:43.874
<i>Ugh!</i>

14:43.910 --> 14:44.708
[ beep ]

14:44.744 --> 14:47.277
Kickin' Hawk: Big mistake, kid.

14:48.112 --> 14:48.945
Attea: Hyah!

14:48.980 --> 14:50.145
[ shing! ]

14:56.385 --> 15:00.187
There's too many of them!
- Rook: We hold the line!

15:00.223 --> 15:01.789
Whoa!

15:03.757 --> 15:06.092
I don't think there's
much of a line left.

15:06.127 --> 15:07.092
[ rumbling ]

15:07.128 --> 15:10.462
Rook: Huh?
Bralla da.

15:17.036 --> 15:19.003
Attea: Aah!

15:19.039 --> 15:25.343
Come on, boys!
All pushing!

15:25.378 --> 15:26.344
[ burps ]

15:26.379 --> 15:27.244
Pardon.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.546
[ all burp ]

15:28.581 --> 15:30.548
[ grunting ]

15:30.583 --> 15:35.519
[ straining ] I would do literally
anything to get out of this airlock.

15:35.554 --> 15:38.022
[ electricity crackles ]

15:38.057 --> 15:40.057
Kickin' Hawk: You think?

15:47.397 --> 15:49.665
[ exhales deeply ]

15:58.573 --> 16:00.908
Rook: [ grunts ]

16:04.412 --> 16:07.714
Ben!

16:07.749 --> 16:12.385
Attea: I am General Attea ...
Princess, scion, and teen

16:12.420 --> 16:15.554
supreme of the deathless
Incursian empire.

16:15.590 --> 16:16.555

16:16.591 --> 16:18.891
Kickin' Hawk: Huh?

16:18.926 --> 16:19.892
[ beep ]

16:19.927 --> 16:22.061
<i>Whoa!</i>

16:22.096 --> 16:23.229

16:30.271 --> 16:34.873
Hang on tight, your highness!

16:34.874 --> 16:36.408
Attea: Hey!

16:36.444 --> 16:40.412
Kickin' Hawk: Keep it level!

16:40.447 --> 16:44.448
Oh, dear!
Ohh, my tract and tummy.

16:46.284 --> 16:48.119
<i>Ohh!</i>

16:50.622 --> 16:54.591
<i>Whoa!</i>

16:54.626 --> 16:55.926
Oh!

Ben: Aw, man.

17:15.078 --> 17:17.545
Attea: Tough toady, Earth boy.

17:17.580 --> 17:20.214
Ha!

17:20.250 --> 17:21.383
Hyah!

17:21.417 --> 17:23.385
Ben: [ grunts ]

17:23.420 --> 17:24.920

<i>- Run away!
- Run!</i>

17:55.780 --> 17:59.081

17:59.117 --> 18:00.416
Ben: Be right down!

18:00.451 --> 18:02.084
[ indistinct conversations ]

18:02.119 --> 18:03.803
<i>What are you? Deficient?</i>

18:03.804 --> 18:05.487
Plan Omega is our only chance!

18:05.522 --> 18:07.989
There's an invading force on
Peptos XI.

18:08.025 --> 18:10.458
Plan Omega's gonna do the work
for them!

18:10.494 --> 18:13.795
I'll be the judge of that.
- Queen Rumbeltum!

18:13.830 --> 18:16.098
Your majesty.

18:18.099 --> 18:20.636
Sergeant Cast Iron, thank

18:20.671 --> 18:24.640
you for your bold rescue
of my royal person.

18:24.675 --> 18:26.309
[ burps ]

18:26.344 --> 18:29.312
Well, of course, your grace.

18:29.348 --> 18:34.017
<i>My boys, I had the most
wonderful feast planned.</i>

18:34.052 --> 18:36.787
<i>Oh, well!
Perhaps in the next world.</i>

18:36.822 --> 18:39.724
It's moving day!
Bon appétit!

18:39.759 --> 18:41.092
Rook: Huh?

18:45.331 --> 18:47.799
[ slurp! ]

18:47.834 --> 18:49.434
Mmm.

19:02.682 --> 19:06.318
Ben: They're eating the planet!
- This is plan Omega.

19:06.354 --> 19:10.823
They can't take our planet if
there's no planet to take.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.659
[ all munching ]

19:13.695 --> 19:16.195
It's called Peptos XI, dumpling.

19:16.231 --> 19:19.732
What do you think
happened to the other 10?

19:19.768 --> 19:21.334
Ben: Wait, you mean those

19:21.369 --> 19:25.672
other planets, the wreckage
we saw ... you... ate them?

19:25.707 --> 19:26.806
[ scoffs ]

19:26.841 --> 19:31.645
And just when we got this
planet the way we liked it...

19:31.680 --> 19:32.912
Attea: [ grunts ]

19:32.948 --> 19:35.080
Your highness...
- Attea: No!

19:35.116 --> 19:39.486
We can't let these
little freaks beat us!

19:42.522 --> 19:44.789
Highest commander, our troops!

19:44.790 --> 19:47.056
We can't take much more of this!

19:47.091 --> 19:49.592
[ all munching ]

20:00.171 --> 20:02.806
Rook: Is my vehicle
still spaceworthy?

20:02.841 --> 20:05.108
Ben: But I...
who's with the...?

20:05.144 --> 20:07.210
What the... this?
Ugh, I can't.

20:07.246 --> 20:09.012
Rook: It is not uncommon.

20:09.047 --> 20:12.782
Many species develop such
defense mechanisms. It is...

20:12.818 --> 20:15.084
Ben: A big universe. Yeah.

20:15.119 --> 20:17.086
[ munching continues ]

20:17.121 --> 20:19.088
When in Rome, I guess.

Upchuck: [ burps ]

20:41.044 --> 20:42.377
Rook: The Gourmands?

20:42.413 --> 20:45.914
Ben: Yeah.
Kind of beautiful.

20:45.949 --> 20:52.921
[ burping continues ]

20:52.957 --> 20:54.356
And the moment passes.

20:54.391 --> 20:58.193
Rook: Perhaps the Gourmands
will be happy in their new home.

20:58.228 --> 21:03.132
<i>Ben: Sure, provided they can
keep from eating it.</i>

21:04.167 --> 21:05.199

<i>all living creatures tremble in your ...</i>

21:16.279 --> 21:18.445
Attea, you're stalling.

21:18.481 --> 21:21.615
<i>Attea: The operation on
Peptos was a complete success.</i>

21:21.650 --> 21:26.219
So, it's ours now?
- Attea: I... changed my mind.

21:26.254 --> 21:32.892
<i>Better to destroy it and let it
serve as a warning to others.</i>

21:32.927 --> 21:35.395
You are wise, daughter of mine.

21:35.430 --> 21:39.934
Soon the rest of the
galaxy knuckles under...

21:39.935 --> 21:42.937
or there will be fireworks.

21:42.972 --> 21:48.285
And soon, many places do not
even get to knuckle under.
