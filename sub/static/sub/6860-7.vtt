00:16.469 --> 00:18.671
Ancient Jedi tradition!

00:18.738 --> 00:22.175
Six younglings are sent
to the secret caverns of Ilum,

00:22.209 --> 00:24.143
where they are tested
by The Gathering,

00:24.178 --> 00:25.778
an ancient Jedi ritual

00:25.813 --> 00:28.081
where each youngling
must harvest a crystal,

00:28.115 --> 00:31.317
around which they will construct
their own lightsaber.

00:31.352 --> 00:35.088
Along the journey,
they underwent great perils,

00:35.122 --> 00:38.592
hardest of which
was to face themselves.

00:38.659 --> 00:40.827
Now, having passed the test,

00:40.862 --> 00:44.365
they take their first step
into a larger world.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.819 --> 01:06.154
I call that move
the "Whirlwind of Destiny."

01:06.189 --> 01:07.623
Showoff.

01:09.525 --> 01:12.327
Can everyone gather around, please?

01:15.864 --> 01:18.366
You have all successfully passed
The Gathering

01:18.400 --> 01:20.301
and harvested your crystals.

01:22.537 --> 01:25.139
So when do we start
to build our sabers?

01:25.173 --> 01:27.041
Place your crystals on the table.

01:27.075 --> 01:29.009
Your lesson begins now.

01:29.044 --> 01:34.281
May I introduce you to architect
and lightsaber designer Huyang?

01:44.393 --> 01:45.927
These are them.

01:45.961 --> 01:49.264
I swear they get younger
every expedition.

01:49.298 --> 01:51.866
All have passed The Gathering?

01:51.901 --> 01:53.068
Yes, sir.

01:53.102 --> 01:54.503
Are you sure?

01:54.537 --> 01:55.904
But he's a droid.

01:55.939 --> 01:58.607
You expect us to learn from a droid?

01:58.642 --> 02:00.543
Who said that?

02:02.546 --> 02:04.180
Many years I have been on this ship,

02:04.215 --> 02:05.815
teaching many a Jedi before you,

02:05.850 --> 02:08.384
and I will continue teaching
many a Jedi after you.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.355
Call me what you want,
but inside my memory banks,

02:11.389 --> 02:14.158
I contain a record
of every lightsaber ever made

02:14.192 --> 02:15.692
and the Jedi who fashioned them.

02:15.727 --> 02:16.760
Whoa!
Look at that!

02:16.794 --> 02:18.661
Which will you choose?
A simple grip?

02:18.696 --> 02:20.396
The curved approach?

02:20.431 --> 02:23.132
One inlaid with the bone
of the Cartusion whale,

02:23.166 --> 02:25.968
pastillion ore, or black onk?

02:26.002 --> 02:27.736
Well?

02:27.770 --> 02:31.005
From Battles of Rashfond
to the Peacekeeping of Parliock

02:31.040 --> 02:32.607
to our very own Clone Wars,

02:32.641 --> 02:36.009
the lightsaber is a Jedi's
only true ally.

02:36.044 --> 02:37.544
But how do they work, hmm?

02:37.579 --> 02:40.047
Yes, you have brought me crystals,

02:40.081 --> 02:42.482
but they're all useless
unless you give them life.

02:42.517 --> 02:46.453
Do you know how to awaken
the Force within the crystal?

02:46.487 --> 02:48.288
No?

02:48.322 --> 02:50.123
Then I suggest you listen and learn

02:50.158 --> 02:54.028
until you think of a question
this droid cannot answer.

02:54.062 --> 02:55.930
A Wookiee.

02:55.964 --> 02:58.499
Rare you are to the Jedi.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.401
Proud your people must be.

03:01.603 --> 03:04.304
Unique, just as
your lightsaber will be.

03:04.339 --> 03:07.574
Hold out your hand, Wookiee.

03:07.608 --> 03:10.477
Describe what you see
your saber to be.

03:13.814 --> 03:16.015
No, no, no, not what you imagine

03:16.050 --> 03:18.351
but what you feel in your hand.

03:18.386 --> 03:19.753
Concentrate.

03:19.787 --> 03:22.222
What will make you strong in battle

03:22.257 --> 03:24.058
and humble in retreat?

03:24.092 --> 03:26.227
What connects with your Force?

03:32.001 --> 03:36.504
Ah, yes, wood.
Not a common choice.

03:36.538 --> 03:38.339
And only wood from the brylark tree

03:38.373 --> 03:39.640
is as strong as metal.

03:39.675 --> 03:40.875
Let me see.

03:40.943 --> 03:43.844
Where would we find that
all the way out here,

03:43.879 --> 03:48.082
far from anywhere, deep in space?

03:50.284 --> 03:53.086
Let's see what we have.

03:53.121 --> 03:55.622
Let me see.
Let me...

03:55.657 --> 03:58.492
Yes, yes, yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:58.527 --> 04:01.328
Ah, I wondered where I put that.

04:01.362 --> 04:04.198
Oh, that's not mine.

04:04.232 --> 04:08.702
Ah, ah, what do we have here?

04:12.106 --> 04:14.275
- Whoa, look at that.
- Ooh.

04:14.309 --> 04:17.244
- Ooh.
- Wow.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.779
You can say that again.

04:19.814 --> 04:20.914
Wow.

04:20.949 --> 04:23.584
It is my job,
before you leave this ship,

04:23.618 --> 04:25.052
you will have everything you need

04:25.086 --> 04:26.487
to build your lightsabers

04:26.521 --> 04:28.655
and the knowledge of how to do it.

04:28.690 --> 04:29.957
So let us begin.

04:29.991 --> 04:32.693
There is much more work to be done.

04:45.674 --> 04:46.874
Well, where are they?

04:46.909 --> 04:49.844
The Jedi ship
is right in front of us, sir.

04:49.878 --> 04:53.381
Lose them, and you'll lose
more than your head.

04:53.415 --> 04:56.217
Our attack must be swift
and devastating.

04:56.252 --> 04:58.386
They cannot have time to get away.

05:00.389 --> 05:04.025
I thought we weren't going
to mess with Jedi anymore.

05:04.060 --> 05:06.094
These aren't Jedi.

05:06.128 --> 05:08.730
My sources say
they're just younglings,

05:08.764 --> 05:13.235
headed back to the Jedi Temple
from a training mission

05:13.269 --> 05:16.371
with the most important treasure
in the universe--

05:16.406 --> 05:20.842
Kiber crystals,
used for making laser swords.

05:20.876 --> 05:25.480
The price for just one
would make a man rich,

05:25.514 --> 05:30.385
and we all know how much
I like to be rich, don't we?

05:45.434 --> 05:47.635
What's the rush, Petro?

05:48.938 --> 05:50.137
With this lightsaber,

05:50.172 --> 05:52.640
I'm going to challenge
Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel

05:52.674 --> 05:54.275
and kill Grievous.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.755
The only person
you are going to kill with that,

06:07.789 --> 06:09.757
my young friend, is yourself.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.693
You have inverted the emitter matrix,

06:11.727 --> 06:14.229
which will cause the power grid
to backfire.

06:14.264 --> 06:16.198
Light this, and all that will be left

06:16.232 --> 06:17.533
of you and your lightsaber

06:17.567 --> 06:18.968
will be your crystal.

06:19.002 --> 06:20.336
Start again,

06:20.370 --> 06:24.674
and this time,
please follow the diagram.

06:37.656 --> 06:41.192
Remember, quiet your mind
and concentrate.

06:41.226 --> 06:44.729
The design will become clear.

06:44.763 --> 06:47.298
Good. Gently.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.666
Trust the Force.

06:49.735 --> 06:50.735
What was that?

06:50.770 --> 06:52.971
I don't know.
Hold on.

06:57.910 --> 06:59.444
Artoo, what's happened?

07:02.014 --> 07:03.715
Where?

07:03.783 --> 07:06.117
Oh, no.

07:11.050 --> 07:13.005
Ugh, they're aiming for the hyperdrive.

07:13.245 --> 07:14.379
Get us out of here!

07:25.358 --> 07:27.392
I don't like the sound of that.

07:27.426 --> 07:29.928
Stay here.
I'll check on the younglings.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.968
Excellent shot.

07:36.002 --> 07:38.103
Fire the grappling harpoons.

07:42.008 --> 07:47.980
Now reel them in,
and let's get what we came for.

08:27.588 --> 08:28.888
What's happening?

08:28.923 --> 08:30.456
We're being boarded.

08:30.491 --> 08:32.258
Here? Why?

08:32.292 --> 08:34.394
I don't know.

08:34.428 --> 08:36.294
Quickly, give me your crystals,

08:36.328 --> 08:38.663
and I will hold on to them
until we are safe.

09:27.848 --> 09:29.677
Younglings! Younglings!

09:29.797 --> 09:31.411
Who's attacking the ship?

09:31.531 --> 09:32.818
Pirates.

09:32.853 --> 09:35.388
Pirates?
They'll kill us all.

09:36.723 --> 09:39.659
Perhaps we should hide
in the ventilation shaft.

09:39.693 --> 09:41.894
Follow me.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.663
Hiding is for cowards.

09:43.697 --> 09:45.331
We should stand and fight.

09:45.366 --> 09:48.735
Huh, we're gonna fight,
just not the way they expect.

09:50.437 --> 09:52.706
Time to go.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.741
Is this part of our training?

09:54.775 --> 09:56.009
It is now.

10:08.224 --> 10:09.824
Shh.

10:10.917 --> 10:14.753
Hondo says find the kids
and bring 'em to him.

10:14.788 --> 10:17.056
Dead or alive?

10:17.091 --> 10:18.391
Yes.

10:20.628 --> 10:22.896
We must have courage, young Jedi.

10:22.931 --> 10:25.800
Ganodi and Zatt, I need you
to get to the cockpit,

10:25.834 --> 10:28.068
find Artoo, and secure it.

10:28.103 --> 10:30.637
The rest of you, take Professor Huyang

10:30.672 --> 10:32.606
and seal yourselves inside the hold,

10:32.641 --> 10:34.341
and wait for my command.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.476
What are you going to do?

10:36.511 --> 10:39.379
I'm going to reroute
enough power to the engines

10:39.414 --> 10:41.982
so that we can break free
of the pirate ship's hold on us.

10:42.016 --> 10:43.450
Okay?

10:43.484 --> 10:46.486
Wh--what about the pirates
already on board the ship?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.488
Once the docking tube is ruptured,

10:48.522 --> 10:51.391
when the ships pull apart,
a vacuum will be created,

10:51.425 --> 10:54.527
which will suck the pirates
off our ship and into space.

10:54.561 --> 10:57.197
Will we be sucked into space?

10:57.231 --> 11:01.101
No, the cockpit and the hold
will be sealed

11:01.135 --> 11:02.903
and still have air.

11:02.937 --> 11:07.106
Do not--and I mean do not--
engage the pirates.

11:07.140 --> 11:09.675
Your only job is to stay hidden.

11:09.709 --> 11:11.377
Do you understand?

11:12.879 --> 11:13.879
Now go.

11:24.556 --> 11:26.824
I smell profit!

11:28.126 --> 11:32.296
Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits.

11:32.331 --> 11:33.597
Well?

11:33.632 --> 11:37.101
We've secured the ship,
but she seems deserted.

11:37.135 --> 11:38.636
Imbecile!

11:38.671 --> 11:41.172
That is the oldest trick in the book.

11:41.207 --> 11:44.943
The runts are probably hiding
in the ventilation system.

11:45.010 --> 11:46.811
Oh. Right.

11:46.845 --> 11:47.945
Didn't think of that.

11:48.013 --> 11:50.048
Why does that not surprise me?

11:50.082 --> 11:53.217
All that matters is you find
the younglings

11:53.252 --> 11:55.386
and bring me the crystals.

11:55.420 --> 11:58.589
If anything gets in the way, kill it.

11:58.657 --> 12:02.726
But, boss, they're just kids.

12:02.761 --> 12:05.930
They're just kids.
When will they learn?

12:05.964 --> 12:08.466
In case you lack motivation,

12:08.500 --> 12:11.335
remember that on the black market,

12:11.370 --> 12:14.372
these crystals are priceless.

12:17.242 --> 12:19.143
We can't fit in there.

12:19.211 --> 12:22.013
Smoke them out.

12:22.047 --> 12:24.215
You heard the boss.

12:37.898 --> 12:41.401
I do love me a party.

13:03.059 --> 13:04.459
Hold it!

13:09.198 --> 13:11.265
Get off him!

13:11.333 --> 13:12.566
Easy, there.

13:12.601 --> 13:15.269
That's no way to make friends,
now, is it?

13:20.008 --> 13:20.975
Thanks, buddy.

13:24.288 --> 13:25.722
Come on, keep up.

13:25.756 --> 13:27.291
The hold is not much further.

13:27.325 --> 13:30.060
Something's wrong.

13:44.676 --> 13:46.392
Unhand me, brigand!

13:46.512 --> 13:49.647
Well, hello, girls and boys.

13:49.681 --> 13:53.518
We've been looking forward
to meetin' ya.

14:00.135 --> 14:03.037
Now, be nice,
and hand over your crystals.

14:03.526 --> 14:05.661
Over my dead body.

14:05.695 --> 14:08.998
That can be arranged.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.203
Petro, no.

14:14.238 --> 14:17.240
Your emitter matrix is still inverted.

14:17.274 --> 14:21.077
So which one of you is first?

14:21.111 --> 14:23.847
All bark, no bite.

14:23.881 --> 14:26.717
Ah, that's for me.

14:26.751 --> 14:29.420
I always wanted one of these.

14:29.454 --> 14:31.556
You sure you can handle it?

14:34.827 --> 14:35.827
Huh?

14:35.861 --> 14:38.063
Everybody get down!

14:45.905 --> 14:47.606
Let's go.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.508
Hurry, hurry.
This way, younglings.

15:03.423 --> 15:05.057
You could have killed him.

15:05.091 --> 15:07.992
Look, we can keep running,
or we can stand and fight

15:08.060 --> 15:10.562
and show these pirates
we're not afraid.

15:11.931 --> 15:13.999
I cannot approve of such action.

15:14.033 --> 15:17.369
Besides, I have been damaged
and cannot aid you in battle.

15:19.606 --> 15:21.040
Petro's right.

15:21.075 --> 15:23.209
It's our only choice:

15:23.244 --> 15:26.079
fight or be killed.

15:35.355 --> 15:37.389
Zatt, come in.

15:37.424 --> 15:40.026
I am overriding
the emergency power fail-safe

15:40.061 --> 15:41.962
and routing energy to the engines.

15:41.996 --> 15:43.163
It's working.

15:43.197 --> 15:44.564
Any word from the others?

15:44.599 --> 15:46.166
Have they reached the hold?

15:46.200 --> 15:49.603
- Uh, not yet.
- Where are they?

15:49.637 --> 15:52.572
I don't know.
I didn't hear from them.

15:52.606 --> 15:55.675
Great.
I know what that means.

16:00.849 --> 16:03.350
Set them to the highest level.

16:11.291 --> 16:12.292
Get him!

16:14.595 --> 16:15.661
Gungi!

16:25.438 --> 16:28.073
Here, kiddie kiddies.

16:28.107 --> 16:31.677
You can come out now.

16:31.744 --> 16:34.146
No one's gonna hurt you.

16:35.982 --> 16:38.649
Zatt, close the door
to the training room.

16:38.683 --> 16:40.451
Katooni, where are you guys?

16:40.485 --> 16:43.287
No time to explain.
Just close the door.

16:43.321 --> 16:44.621
Artoo, close the door!

16:48.293 --> 16:50.094
Hey, what's--what's going on?

17:15.287 --> 17:16.686
We can't make it.

17:18.957 --> 17:21.125
There are too many blocking the hold.

17:28.067 --> 17:31.738
Well, children,
you have put up quite a fight,

17:31.772 --> 17:33.907
but playtime is over.

17:33.941 --> 17:37.043
Now, hand over my crystals,

17:37.078 --> 17:39.679
and no one gets hurt...much.

17:44.718 --> 17:46.919
Hondo, the Jedi Council

17:46.954 --> 17:49.689
will not take kindly to this attack.

17:49.723 --> 17:55.194
Ahsoka, how will they know
who is responsible

17:55.229 --> 17:58.231
if there is no one left
to tell the tale?

17:58.265 --> 18:01.635
You seem less hospitable
than our last meeting.

18:01.702 --> 18:04.504
My mood is based on profit,

18:04.539 --> 18:08.708
and today I am in the mood
for crystals.

18:08.742 --> 18:10.844
You want the crystals?

18:10.878 --> 18:12.478
Come and get 'em.

18:18.853 --> 18:21.054
Oh, easy, now.

18:21.088 --> 18:24.124
Hurry, hurry.

18:24.158 --> 18:25.326
What about Ahsoka?

18:25.360 --> 18:27.561
Trust her.
Now, get in there.

18:27.595 --> 18:29.429
Oh!

18:29.463 --> 18:31.431
How dare you?

18:31.465 --> 18:33.467
I've lived on this ship
a thousand years

18:33.501 --> 18:34.935
and never lost a fight.

18:34.969 --> 18:36.837
I'm not about to start today.

18:46.248 --> 18:49.383
You know, had I known you were here,

18:49.418 --> 18:53.355
I would have simply asked
for the crystals directly,

18:53.389 --> 18:55.490
and we could have avoided all of this.

18:55.524 --> 18:57.292
I don't want to hurt you, Hondo.

18:57.326 --> 19:01.196
I know, and I appreciate that.

19:02.665 --> 19:04.032
We're all in the hold,

19:04.066 --> 19:06.034
but Ahsoka's still out there
fighting the pirates.

19:06.102 --> 19:08.269
Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in.

19:08.304 --> 19:09.671
They've made it to the hold.

19:09.705 --> 19:11.206
Then what are you waiting for?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.574
But what about you?

19:12.608 --> 19:13.575
Do it!

19:39.668 --> 19:41.235
What are you doing?

19:41.303 --> 19:43.671
Getting you off my ship.

19:45.741 --> 19:48.343
Oh!

19:48.377 --> 19:49.644
Whoa!

19:53.415 --> 19:56.151
Whoa, whoa, ah!

20:15.503 --> 20:16.671
Whoa!

20:23.611 --> 20:25.245
We're all clear.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.714
Make the jump to hyperspace.

20:27.749 --> 20:29.516
Ah, ah, ah!

20:39.629 --> 20:41.663
Yes! We did it!

20:41.698 --> 20:42.731
They're off the ship.

20:48.171 --> 20:49.571
Oh, Professor.

20:49.605 --> 20:52.808
Bring him here.
I'll fix him.

20:54.344 --> 20:57.445
You should have seen Ahsoka.
She took them on all by herself.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.915
Where is Padawan Tano?

20:59.949 --> 21:02.651
Padawan Tano, come in.

21:02.685 --> 21:05.387
Ahsoka.

21:05.422 --> 21:09.091
Ahsoka!
Ahsoka, are you there?

21:17.866 --> 21:20.968
You have cost me greatly today,
young one.

21:21.003 --> 21:25.106
And since you lost me so much profit,

21:25.140 --> 21:27.742
I am left with no choice...

21:32.815 --> 21:38.520
But to turn you into profit.

21:40.123 --> 21:41.456
Good night.

21:44.026 --> 21:54.500
