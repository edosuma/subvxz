WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.567
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.611 --> 00:03.960
I have decided
to hold a press conference

00:04.004 --> 00:05.092
to reveal that I'm Guardian.

00:05.135 --> 00:06.615
You can't do that.

00:06.658 --> 00:09.096
If they expose your identity,
then you're a vigilante.

00:09.139 --> 00:10.619
It's like
the cornerstone

00:10.662 --> 00:13.056
of all the non-lethal tech
that I'm creating for J'onn.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.492
Demos, your belt!

00:17.539 --> 00:19.758
It turns out the Harun-El
we used to kill Reign

00:19.802 --> 00:22.979
and save Sam split them apart.
But Reign is not gone.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.415
Reign and Sam
are still connected.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.287
If Sam gets stronger,
then Reign would get weaker.

00:26.330 --> 00:27.592
My thoughts exactly.

00:27.636 --> 00:30.073
But how?
Nothing we've tried
has worked.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.814
The Fountains of Lillith.

00:31.857 --> 00:35.209
One fountain gave
infinite strength.
The other brought weakness.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.167
I'm going back
to the Dark Valley.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.432
Let us begin.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.609
Transform this planet
into New Krypton.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.788
On Zune, they terraformed
her planet's
natural resources,

00:49.832 --> 00:52.661
so they'd go right
through the planet's core
to create a genesis event.

00:52.704 --> 00:55.229
Go through the Earth's core,
and you get pretty close
to Madagascar.

00:55.272 --> 00:56.578
I can stop this.

00:56.621 --> 00:57.796
It'd rip you apart.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.581
This planet is my son's home.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.931
I intend to save it with him.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.172
Nice one, Mom.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.478
It's hurting her.
-No, it's okay, it's okay.

01:27.522 --> 01:29.654
She's gonna
get through this,
and stop it.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.268
Everyone down,
as quick as you can.

01:34.311 --> 01:35.834
Get away from the building.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.575
Superman saves Madagascar,

01:37.619 --> 01:39.273
more from our reporter
on the ground.

01:39.316 --> 01:40.796
Kick some ass, Clark.

01:59.597 --> 02:01.904
Our time is short, it seems.

02:01.947 --> 02:02.992
Give them all to me.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.733
Every memory. I can take it.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.474
We haven't the time.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.867
But there is one more
I must give you.

02:13.524 --> 02:16.832
This is the dawn of our kind.

02:16.875 --> 02:20.618
She was the first keeper
of the sacred scrolls.

02:21.837 --> 02:25.710
This is the moment
she received them.

02:43.380 --> 02:46.296
My son!
My son is in there!

02:46.340 --> 02:48.690
My son's on
the second floor.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.387
-Please--
-You cannot go in there.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.302
-Please, I've gotta get him.
-No one will get hurt.

02:52.346 --> 02:53.651
Get out of my way!

02:53.695 --> 02:55.740
-My son, I have to get him.
-Listen to me.

02:58.743 --> 02:59.744
I will get him.

03:00.354 --> 03:01.920
You have to trust me.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.065
No, no, no. Ah!
Supergirl, the waterfront.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.632
We're on our way.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.111
Okay, looks like
we have some help.

03:20.287 --> 03:22.724
You didn't think
I'd miss out on the fun.

03:24.813 --> 03:25.857
You're up.

03:40.089 --> 03:41.133
Thank you.

03:57.367 --> 03:58.455
You're all clear, kid.

03:58.499 --> 04:00.327
Now let's blow this thing
and go home.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.851
I assume that's
some sort of film reference.

04:02.894 --> 04:07.377
We never showed you Star Wars?
Not a single Star War?

04:29.660 --> 04:32.881
I'm sorry I couldn't
give you the rest.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.493
Don't apologize.

04:37.842 --> 04:38.887
Don't.

04:39.453 --> 04:41.019
I had a good life.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.026
I'm not ready.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.419
-You are.

04:49.463 --> 04:52.814
You looked into the flames,
and you had no fear.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.033
That's because
you were with me.

04:56.600 --> 04:59.777
That will never change, J'onn.

05:01.213 --> 05:02.519
Never.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.788
Live as H'ronmeer taught,
among the people.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.574
Promote peace.

05:15.227 --> 05:18.187
And be happy...

05:19.536 --> 05:20.929
my son.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.135
Is it done?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.536
Myr'nn stopped it.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.867
J'onn, I'm so sorry.

06:30.346 --> 06:31.565
He saved us.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.614
Saturn Girl.

06:37.658 --> 06:39.442
Thank you for coming back
when you did.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.313
The city would've been lost
without you.

06:41.357 --> 06:43.359
How did you know to come back?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.535
We got Mon-El's signal.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.059
The message from the, uh...
the time beacon.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.453
Mon-El said it broke on Argo.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.107
It did.

06:52.150 --> 06:55.545
Uh, the... the beacon
must've had a fail-safe,

06:55.589 --> 06:58.983
to send a message
even if it powered down.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.551
Winn, did you track down
the source of the terraforming?

07:01.595 --> 07:02.987
Or Reign's location?

07:03.031 --> 07:05.642
-Still working on it.

07:05.686 --> 07:07.209
Has she woken up?

07:07.252 --> 07:09.080
She's gonna come
through this, right?

07:10.038 --> 07:12.344
She's gonna be able
to fight Reign.

07:12.388 --> 07:13.824
No doubt in my mind.

07:17.219 --> 07:18.873
No. No. No!

07:18.916 --> 07:21.353
-Get away from me!
-Shh!

07:21.397 --> 07:22.920
I'm trying to help you.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.618
It's not safe here.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.097
No, you're dead.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.492
This is a mirage.
I've been here before.

07:29.536 --> 07:30.885
I'm not a mirage.

07:30.928 --> 07:33.844
I'm your mother
and I love you.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.629
Get out of my head!

07:36.543 --> 07:38.066
Where is she?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.415
Perished.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.332
No. No, New Krypton must rise.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.073
The Cauldron is frozen.

07:45.116 --> 07:47.989
Dead, useless.

07:48.032 --> 07:50.426
Crush the world to make a new.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.999
Well, thank you for being here.

08:00.175 --> 08:03.178
I know the circumstances
weren't what you were expecting.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.222
And I'm sorry.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.617
Don't be.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.185
These things happen
for a reason.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.796
It's important
that we both have our closure.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.276
This distance
has made me realize

08:14.319 --> 08:17.061
our marriage was never
what it should have been.

08:17.105 --> 08:19.499
I mean, the fact
that I didn't feel I could

08:19.542 --> 08:21.892
tell you about
the Pestilence mission.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.678
The fact I lied to you...

08:27.289 --> 08:28.290
I'm sorry.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.688
Yeah, but we were
still pretty good partners
in the Legion, huh?

08:51.618 --> 08:53.315
The Fountain of Lillith.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.584
No!

09:01.628 --> 09:02.803
It's the wrong well.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.545
This is the fountain
that gives strength.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.155
That water will kill you.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.983
You're lying to me!
Just, please stop.

09:09.026 --> 09:12.900
This... this is the water
that gave Reign the strength.

09:14.336 --> 09:17.861
Samantha, I failed you
as a mother.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.169
And I lost you.

09:21.212 --> 09:24.694
And I've lived
with such regret
ever since.

09:24.738 --> 09:27.784
But here, I have
another chance, and...

09:29.220 --> 09:33.137
All that remains of me
is my love for you.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.097
Please, you have
to believe me.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.364
I can't make a mistake.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.283
Drink this. Now.

09:53.462 --> 09:54.898
Trust me, Sam.

10:10.435 --> 10:11.611
You're smiling.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.048
That is not good.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.354
No, actually, Brainy,
smiling is, uh...
It's a good thing.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.226
Yes, I know
what smiling indicates.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.010
But in your case,
I ran a simulation,

10:20.054 --> 10:23.318
and there
is a zero-percent chance
that you would be smiling

10:23.361 --> 10:27.191
after what Imra was supposed
to have told you, so...

10:28.453 --> 10:29.716
Hey, Brainy.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.500
Mon-El said that you, uh,
want to talk to me.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.328
Hey, sorry, Winn,
just, uh...

10:33.371 --> 10:35.939
Could you give us a moment?
We're just talking
about some Legion...

10:35.983 --> 10:38.942
Oh, no. This involves
Winn as well.

10:40.944 --> 10:44.469
Oh, yes, the Legion
needs the both of you.

10:46.297 --> 10:50.911
Killing Pestilence
saved the future
from the Blight.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.043
Millions of people
were spared.

10:55.176 --> 10:59.484
Including my extremely
distant relative.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.836
The evil one,

11:02.879 --> 11:07.231
who has created
a plague to wipe out
all AIs other than himself.

11:07.275 --> 11:10.670
In short,
all AIs are in danger.

11:12.149 --> 11:13.934
And I can no longer stay there.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.373
The future needs heroes.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.986
The future needs leaders.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.162
The future has leaders.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.257
The future needs you, Mon-El.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.346
To fight.

11:38.610 --> 11:42.527
And it needs Winn
to take my place in the Legion
and save the AIs.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.880
Uh...

11:46.923 --> 11:49.796
What? No. Okay, rewind.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.188
First of all,
you've told me hundreds,

11:51.232 --> 11:52.973
literally hundreds of times,

11:53.016 --> 11:55.279
that I am far below
a 12th-level intellect.

11:55.323 --> 11:59.022
So how could I possibly
be your replacement?

12:01.024 --> 12:03.026
How'd you get this?
What is this?

12:03.070 --> 12:04.680
That's from
the National Archives.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.725
You're right.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.162
And it's Winn's design.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.555
The Nat... No.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.211
They said it didn't work!

12:14.255 --> 12:16.866
No, it didn't...
It couldn't save Demos.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.086
Regardless of what happened
with your friend,

12:20.261 --> 12:23.525
this design is the foundation

12:23.568 --> 12:26.310
of some of the future's
most groundbreaking technology.

12:27.268 --> 12:31.098
It has saved countless lives.

12:31.141 --> 12:34.492
And this,
this dirty piece of paper,

12:35.537 --> 12:39.106
is an artifact,
treasured centuries from now.

12:45.025 --> 12:46.504
The future needs you.

12:50.726 --> 12:51.771
Both of you.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.046
-New world... New...

13:17.318 --> 13:18.928
She has returned.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.757
The Earth's core's
tried to hold me captive,

13:22.453 --> 13:23.541
but I broke through.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.413
As I knew my daughter would.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.545
We must restart
the Cauldron.
We will.

13:27.589 --> 13:30.287
And then we will watch
this Earth burn,

13:30.331 --> 13:33.334
so that Krypton
may rise again.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.563
Any changes?

13:46.347 --> 13:47.522
No.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.829
Her vitals are weak,
but they're steady.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.657
We just have to hope
she's strong enough
to make it to the Fountain.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.920
I know she will be.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.444
She's a warrior for Ruby.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.493
You know, you're really
wonderful with Ruby.

14:02.537 --> 14:05.148
You're gonna make
a natural mother.

14:05.192 --> 14:09.979
Yeah, and yet I haven't
made any steps to, uh,
make that a reality.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.460
It took me forever
to find Maggie.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.332
So what am I supposed to do?

14:15.376 --> 14:18.031
Am I supposed to hope
that I fall in love again

14:18.074 --> 14:20.076
with somebody
who wants to have kids?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.686
Or do I try and do this
on my own?

14:22.252 --> 14:25.168
And if so, how?

14:25.212 --> 14:30.217
I mean, it's not like my job
is conducive to being
a single parent.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.436
But then again,
if we don't stop Reign,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.569
I guess this is all
just a moot point.

14:34.612 --> 14:36.397
That's true.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.617
But you've identified
what you want,
and that's half the battle.

14:41.576 --> 14:42.882
People like you and me,

14:44.144 --> 14:46.624
we do what it takes
to get what we want.

14:46.668 --> 14:50.890
And when
we defeat Reign, I have
no doubt you'll figure it out.

14:53.414 --> 14:55.111
Wait, he wants you
to move to the future?

14:55.155 --> 14:58.593
I know, dude. It's insane.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.161
Right?

15:01.204 --> 15:03.859
Plus, I don't know
where to begin
to solve a problem like that.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.514
Like, I don't know
what Brainy was thinking,

15:06.557 --> 15:08.820
but he is malfunctioning.

15:08.864 --> 15:10.648
Or he's thinking
you're the smartest
dude he knows.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.564
Oh, and then there's this.

15:13.608 --> 15:16.132
And what is "Then there's this"?

15:16.176 --> 15:17.786
Oh, you know, just my design.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.484
Brainy brought it back
from the future.

15:20.528 --> 15:22.225
-I...

15:22.269 --> 15:26.186
Apparently, it's...
It's an artifact,

15:26.229 --> 15:31.060
and my apparatus
saved countless lives
or something.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.934
-Winn.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.848
You are a genius.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.938
The only person
who doubts that is you.

15:42.332 --> 15:45.857
Question is,
what do you wanna do?

15:45.901 --> 15:50.993
I made a shrine to, like,
a cup full of dirt
from the future.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.299
-That's weird.
-Shut up.

15:52.342 --> 15:55.215
You know,
and actually going
to the future,

15:55.258 --> 15:59.045
yeah, that's, like beyond
my wildest dreams.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.483
But, no, this is my home.
Why...

16:02.526 --> 16:08.097
I have you and Kara,
and Alex and J'onn.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.794
Like, you guys...

16:09.838 --> 16:12.667
You guys are my family.
I can't...

16:12.710 --> 16:14.886
That's... That's...
That's too hard.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.896
I took off my mask today.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.681
Wait, what?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.770
Yeah, I took it off. I...

16:31.729 --> 16:34.906
I met this woman with her kid,
and she was in danger.

16:35.864 --> 16:36.908
Panicking.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.130
And there was nothing I could do
to get through to her.

16:41.174 --> 16:45.308
So, I don't know if it was
the humanity in my eyes,

16:45.352 --> 16:47.180
or my real voice.

16:47.223 --> 16:48.746
But after I...

16:52.402 --> 16:54.578
She instantly found her calm.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.888
And that makes me want
to unmask all the time.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.111
But I get it, it's just...

17:07.461 --> 17:08.984
It does feel too hard.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.335
What happened?

17:12.379 --> 17:14.729
J'onn's ship just sent out
a distress signal.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.173
A distress call?
Why would Selena do that?

17:24.217 --> 17:27.089
A trap? I'm just guessing.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.570
Regardless, I've been able
to access the ship's sensor.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.007
My craft is sitting
near a great power source.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.835
I believe it might be the site
of the terraforming.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.532
But Sam is still unconscious.

17:35.576 --> 17:38.057
We need her around
if we're to stand a chance
against Reign.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.711
Actually, before you came back
from Argo,

17:40.755 --> 17:42.800
Lena figured out
that she could end Reign,

17:42.844 --> 17:44.454
with a lethal dose
of Kryptonite.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.587
Now, she wouldn't do that
when Sam and Reign
were connected.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.805
-But now--
No.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.895
I don't kill. Not even her.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.594
There's got to be another way.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.466
What way?
You can't contain her.

17:56.510 --> 17:57.946
You said she's grown invincible

17:57.989 --> 18:00.775
to everything that would
normally hurt a Kryptonian.

18:00.818 --> 18:02.907
Look, sometimes, the thing
we thought we'd never do,

18:02.951 --> 18:04.518
the thing that goes against
our very core,

18:04.561 --> 18:06.737
is the one thing
that we must do.

18:08.652 --> 18:10.828
If all else fails,

18:10.872 --> 18:14.005
and we have no other recourse,
I agree.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.225
We do what we must.

18:21.709 --> 18:25.974
Okay. Whatever it takes.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.281
Send Mon-El and the Legion
the coordinates to my ship.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.586
We'll meet them there.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.895
I can't...

18:33.938 --> 18:35.984
No, you need to drink
a little more.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.987
I can't drink any more.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.119
Yes, you can.

18:41.381 --> 18:42.773
Sam, do you remember?

18:42.817 --> 18:44.514
Do you remember
when you were little?

18:44.558 --> 18:46.908
And you were terrified
to go to sleep at night,

18:46.951 --> 18:49.824
so I would sing you
a little lullaby.

18:49.867 --> 18:54.089
♪ Hush-a-bye, don't you cry

18:54.133 --> 18:57.745
♪ Go to sleep,
You little baby ♪

18:58.485 --> 19:00.182
♪ When you wake

19:00.878 --> 19:03.098
♪ You shall have

19:03.142 --> 19:06.710
♪ All the pretty
Little horses ♪

19:07.363 --> 19:09.844
♪ Blacks and bays

19:09.887 --> 19:12.063
♪ Dappled grays

19:12.107 --> 19:16.242
♪ Coach and
Six-a little horses ♪

19:22.378 --> 19:23.771
It's working.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.953
It's you.

19:35.435 --> 19:37.437
I'm so sorry I doubted you.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.309
Sam, I'm so sorry
for everything.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.703
For all the pain
that I caused you.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.141
It's okay.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.319
It's okay.

19:56.499 --> 19:58.022
It worked.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.417
Mom, you're super.

20:02.418 --> 20:03.550
Where are they?

20:03.593 --> 20:05.595
They went after Reign
and the witches.

20:05.639 --> 20:07.423
Don't worry, I've got this.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.174
A force field.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.396
They're here.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.327
What is this, devilry?

20:41.892 --> 20:43.590
A little piece of home.

21:16.797 --> 21:19.060
I can't hold the force field.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.219
You cannot win.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.658
There is no prison you can build
that can contain me.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.705
There is no one on this planet

21:55.749 --> 21:58.142
of equal power that can kill me.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.189
That's what you think.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.373
-J'onn!
-Supergirl.

23:40.375 --> 23:42.421
Mon-El gave his life
to save me.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.642
All that time
I spent with my father,

23:48.209 --> 23:49.689
I'd learned nothing.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.995
I still came in
fighting like a Manhunter.

23:52.039 --> 23:53.736
No, this is my fault.

23:56.391 --> 24:00.047
I came in here
ready to kill her.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.441
I knew I should have
found another way.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.573
I knew it.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.579
I... I've lost track
of what I stand for.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.714
What have I done?

24:30.294 --> 24:32.122
The Rock split them apart.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.429
It could put them together.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.346
There was a prison
strong enough to contain her.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.087
Alex.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.828
Supergirl, did Sam get there?

24:41.871 --> 24:43.656
She did, but I screwed up.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.528
-I need you to find me
a disruption.
A disruption?

24:46.572 --> 24:48.965
I need to go back in time,
like the Legion.

24:49.009 --> 24:50.401
You can't breathe in space.

24:50.445 --> 24:52.665
I'm wearing Mon-El's ring.
I can breathe with it on.

24:52.708 --> 24:55.232
If I can turn back time,
I could use the electricity
in the Harun-El

24:55.276 --> 24:56.756
to take us
to the Fountain of Lillith.

24:56.799 --> 24:57.931
Okay, but it disrupts...

24:57.974 --> 25:00.281
The pressure alone
is gonna crush you.

25:00.324 --> 25:02.370
Just find me a disruption now.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.604
Kara Danvers
is my favorite person.

25:18.647 --> 25:21.607
She's saved me more times
than Supergirl ever could.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.655
You saved me, remember?

25:26.699 --> 25:29.528
You taught me that my loss
made me stronger.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.663
You will do
extraordinary things.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.232
You cannot win.

25:38.275 --> 25:41.496
There is no prison you can build
that can contain me.

25:42.192 --> 25:45.152
There is no one on this planet

25:45.195 --> 25:47.807
of equal power that can kill me.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.852
That's what you think.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.551
No!

25:56.946 --> 25:58.382
Throw me the Harun-El.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.174
Shock us again in five minutes.

26:07.217 --> 26:08.567
Sam, now!

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
Welcome home.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.665
-This one's for Ruby!

26:23.016 --> 26:24.365
This one's for Patricia.

26:26.019 --> 26:27.455
This one...

26:29.457 --> 26:30.893
This one's for me.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.509
No!

26:57.659 --> 26:59.618
What have you done to me?

27:04.274 --> 27:06.407
No, no, no!

27:11.151 --> 27:12.631
No!

28:00.374 --> 28:01.680
Well, you did it.

28:03.203 --> 28:06.728
Just like a Greek myth,
you went down to the underworld,

28:06.772 --> 28:08.643
and slayed
the three-headed monster,

28:08.687 --> 28:10.340
and saved Persephone.

28:10.384 --> 28:14.475
Uh, I think in the myth,
Persephone eats
pomegranate seeds,

28:14.518 --> 28:16.869
and is confined to the realm
of Hades forever.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.697
Yeah, well, that just
strengthens my point,

28:18.740 --> 28:21.003
because the Greek gods
have nothing on you.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.485
I couldn't have done it
without you.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.705
No, that's not true.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.143
This, uh...
This victory was yours.

28:31.492 --> 28:32.841
It was flawless.

28:39.413 --> 28:40.631
What's on your mind?

28:44.592 --> 28:49.249
Before we went to Argo,
I just had this thought

28:49.292 --> 28:54.602
that I could be Kara Zor-El,
ordinary citizen.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.736
That I would feel
like I was home.

28:59.607 --> 29:01.652
But when we were fighting Reign
and the witches,

29:01.696 --> 29:03.742
I had this moment,

29:05.178 --> 29:07.223
this realization

29:08.442 --> 29:10.313
that Argo City's
not my home anymore.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.187
National City is.

29:15.449 --> 29:16.842
Earth is.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.888
And my mission is to protect it.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.066
I mean, my whole life is here.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.982
-Yeah.
-Messy, complex.

29:27.026 --> 29:30.029
Balancing Kara
and being a hero, that's...

29:32.640 --> 29:33.946
That's who I am.

29:37.166 --> 29:39.255
I have loved fighting
by your side.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.259
Being there through all of it,

29:43.303 --> 29:48.003
the ups, the downs,
the particularly tough days.

29:51.311 --> 29:53.443
You know, for a moment there,
I thought that...

29:55.228 --> 29:56.925
that maybe this was my...

29:57.404 --> 29:58.709
my place,

30:00.146 --> 30:01.277
my time.

30:05.064 --> 30:09.459
But I learned
some troubling things today,
uh, about the future.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.118
I need to go back.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.517
I can't abandon the Legion.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.563
Or the world that I swore
to protect, right when
they need me most.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.391
I know you can't.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.482
You wouldn't be
the man you are,
if you did.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.399
The man I admire so much.

30:41.187 --> 30:43.363
Well, I guess we both got
some saving to do.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.119
And hey.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.993
It's about time
you had one of your own.

31:05.472 --> 31:06.908
Thanks.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.433
In case you ever need me.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.533
Hey, you guys.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.927
Hey. Oh, my goodness.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.191
Oh, yeah, I'm... Okay.

31:29.235 --> 31:31.150
Well, I came to say thank you,

31:31.193 --> 31:33.413
but I think Ruby just did that
for the both of us.

31:33.456 --> 31:36.329
-Yeah.
-You made me feel safe
when everything was horrible,

31:36.372 --> 31:38.635
and you made me have faith
that my mom would get better.

31:38.679 --> 31:41.160
And I don't know
what I would've done
without you.

31:42.117 --> 31:45.251
Well, I mean,
you're a pretty great roomie.

31:45.294 --> 31:47.688
So, wanna give the good news?

31:47.731 --> 31:52.301
Sam, all your blood tests
came back,
and they are normal.

31:53.650 --> 31:56.740
There is no trace
of any Kryptonian DNA.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.307
You are 100% human.

32:00.570 --> 32:01.876
Thank you.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.704
Come here. Thank you.

32:03.747 --> 32:05.314
Oh, God, thank you.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.150
Hey.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.463
I gotta go.

32:27.423 --> 32:29.382
I've been...

32:29.425 --> 32:32.341
I've been searching
for my calling,
you know. This...

32:33.429 --> 32:34.691
This is it.

32:37.694 --> 32:39.827
I must save the future.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.270
What about you?

32:52.057 --> 32:54.363
I can't keep waiting
on the world to change.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.410
My future's now.

33:04.765 --> 33:07.507
I don't know how much longer
I can do this, J'onn.

33:08.856 --> 33:12.120
I put my life
on the line every day.

33:13.165 --> 33:17.691
And every day,
I run the risk of losing it.

33:17.734 --> 33:22.043
And I feel like I haven't
even had the chance
to really live it yet.

33:22.087 --> 33:24.567
I'm afraid that if I don't make
a move soon, right,

33:24.611 --> 33:30.921
if I don't reach out
and take hold of my future,
of what my heart wants,

33:30.965 --> 33:33.794
then I'm never
really gonna be happy.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.276
So, that said, I, uh...

33:40.105 --> 33:41.845
I wanna give notice.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.326
So that I can find
my new beginning,

33:45.806 --> 33:49.592
and I can have a family
of my own.

33:49.636 --> 33:53.640
You're a hero.
It's in your blood.
You can't resign.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.600
Because I want
to promote you.

33:58.688 --> 34:02.475
This year, I have had
the most priceless gift.

34:03.824 --> 34:06.087
I found my father.

34:06.131 --> 34:10.787
I lived with him,
I learned from him.

34:10.831 --> 34:14.661
He reminded me
that the Martian way
is to live amongst the people,

34:15.662 --> 34:17.055
and to help them.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.448
Not hiding behind walls,
like I have been here,

34:19.492 --> 34:23.626
but with open hands
and compassion.

34:23.670 --> 34:24.932
You're stepping down?

34:24.975 --> 34:26.629
I am.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.414
But I am not leaving you.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.546
I would never leave my family.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.419
Alex...

34:34.637 --> 34:37.466
-Uh...
-I want you
to run this place.

34:38.511 --> 34:40.165
Be the director.

34:40.208 --> 34:42.950
With you in charge,
I feel the DEO will stay
on the right path

34:42.993 --> 34:45.170
to protecting this planet,

34:45.213 --> 34:48.129
and helping those
who cannot help themselves.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.871
And being in charge,

34:50.914 --> 34:53.874
you won't have
to put yourself
in the field all day,

34:53.917 --> 34:55.571
risking your life.

34:55.615 --> 34:59.097
You don't have to deny
any part of yourself
to be complete.

34:59.706 --> 35:01.490
You can have a family.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.884
And you can be a mother.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.843
All on your own terms.

35:14.199 --> 35:15.896
Congratulations, Director.

35:19.247 --> 35:21.467
That's not how I saw this going.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.868
Thank you.

35:31.912 --> 35:34.393
Congratulations, sir.
All the best.

35:36.003 --> 35:37.570
He's a hero.

35:40.268 --> 35:42.575
So are you, Kara Zor-El.

35:44.403 --> 35:45.882
I am so proud of you.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.190
You stuck to your ideals,

35:49.234 --> 35:51.584
and found a way
when there was none.

35:53.760 --> 35:57.546
I will miss you, my daughter.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.768
I love you, Mom.

36:01.811 --> 36:02.986
I love you.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.990
And I will bring Selena
and the witches back with me.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.906
They will stand
a just trial,
I promise you.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.604
Good.

36:12.953 --> 36:13.997
Uh...

36:14.998 --> 36:16.435
Lena.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.089
This is the Harun-El
your daughter asked me to make.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.352
And the recipe to make more.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.744
Thank you.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.704
With this Harun-El,
Argo will survive.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.619
Though I hate to depend on it.

36:26.662 --> 36:29.230
There's so many things
that we don't know about it.

36:29.274 --> 36:33.147
Its uses, its powers,
its dangers.

36:34.496 --> 36:37.020
I'm so glad that none of it
will be left on Earth.

36:39.284 --> 36:41.547
-Agent Schott.

36:44.289 --> 36:46.508
You have been a fine agent,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.511
and a spectacular friend.

36:50.817 --> 36:53.167
I'm gonna miss you too,
Papa Bear.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.741
Do not tell Clark
I taught you that.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.570
No promises.

37:05.745 --> 37:07.660
-I'm gonna miss you, man.
-Yeah.

37:34.730 --> 37:37.124
You were the first person
I told I was Supergirl.

37:37.167 --> 37:41.128
-You made my suit,
kept it safe.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.739
You've been a true friend.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.744
I'm really gonna miss you.

37:50.833 --> 37:51.834
Okay.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.889
I'm gonna miss you guys.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.632
Come here.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.286
-Come on.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.265
Eh... Ahh!

38:31.309 --> 38:32.919
Hey, incoming. Incoming!

38:34.964 --> 38:36.879
The future's gonna be
a steep learning curve.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.711
-To saving the world.
-Hear, hear.

38:44.409 --> 38:46.759
Mmm. Excuse me.

38:49.022 --> 38:50.023
Yeah.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.069
Oh, I have a comment.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.203
I'm the Guardian.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.525
We can now confirm
that CatCo's

39:13.568 --> 39:16.266
very own James Olsen
is Guardian.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.662
He did it.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.449
How about Winn
joining the Legion?

39:25.711 --> 39:27.669
Do you think
he'll make them new outfits?

39:27.713 --> 39:29.367
-Oh, absolutely.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.415
I still can't get over J'onn.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.983
Following in
his father's footsteps.

39:37.026 --> 39:38.376
Leaving the DEO.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.466
I did not see that coming.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.728
Yeah.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.469
What about you,

39:44.512 --> 39:46.514
Director Danvers?

39:46.558 --> 39:48.255
You're just so brave.

39:49.474 --> 39:52.302
Yeah, look at you. Okay?

39:52.346 --> 39:57.699
I mean, leaving your mom
after you just found her,

39:57.743 --> 39:59.353
coming back to Earth.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.008
I mean, that takes courage.

40:02.574 --> 40:04.184
Mmm.

40:04.227 --> 40:08.318
I just realized that everything
that makes me me is here.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.147
This is my home.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.106
With you.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.196
On this couch,

40:16.239 --> 40:21.462
-with this insanely huge pizza
that we just downed.

40:21.506 --> 40:23.464
There's no pizza on Argo, huh?

40:23.508 --> 40:25.161
-Nope.
-That's a shame.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.953
You have no idea
how happy I am
that you came back.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.134
Are we gonna be okay?

40:47.575 --> 40:49.185
We're gonna be okay.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.023
Ms. Teschmacher,

41:01.067 --> 41:03.417
we're ready to begin phase two
of our trials.

41:11.077 --> 41:12.774
Throw me the Harun-El!
