00:58.101 --> 01:01.104
It is perfectly typical
for most people

01:01.236 --> 01:04.439
to have a strong faith
in their families...

01:04.573 --> 01:07.010
relying on them
for love and support.

01:07.142 --> 01:10.212
These are people we've grown up
with, who've nurtured us

01:10.345 --> 01:13.448
and who, hopefully, have been
real cheerleaders for us.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.585
But...
let's look at another parable

01:15.718 --> 01:18.153
that talks about
a different kind of faith.

01:18.286 --> 01:19.956
And here's what it says.

01:20.089 --> 01:23.693
"The Kingdom of Heaven is
like a grain of a mustard seed,

01:23.826 --> 01:26.629
"which a man took
and sowed in his field,

01:26.763 --> 01:29.966
"and which indeed is smaller
than all seeds.

01:30.099 --> 01:35.270
"But when it is grown,
it is greater than the herbs

01:35.404 --> 01:38.041
"and becomes a tree,

01:38.173 --> 01:43.478
so that birds come
and lodge in its branches."

01:43.613 --> 01:49.018
And indeed,
faith can become so strong...

01:49.152 --> 01:51.688
that it can move a mountain.

02:02.865 --> 02:04.199
Right! On the right!

02:06.602 --> 02:08.137
There you go, Danny,
way to shake it off!

02:08.270 --> 02:11.273
Honey, come on, sit back down.

02:15.878 --> 02:17.479
Thanks for saving me a seat.

02:17.613 --> 02:20.415
I, I was on the sidelines,
but it's driving me crazy.

02:20.549 --> 02:22.384
I can't take this pressure!

02:22.517 --> 02:24.020
Well, my brother knows

02:24.153 --> 02:26.254
he's got <i>the</i> best girlfriend
in the world.

02:26.388 --> 02:28.256
Yeah, and the most nervous.

02:28.390 --> 02:29.892
Where's Sam?

02:30.026 --> 02:31.928
He went to go get us
some hot dogs.

02:32.061 --> 02:33.228
Hope he doesn't miss anything.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.164
Head back, head back!

02:35.297 --> 02:37.200
Right here, outside!

02:37.332 --> 02:39.234
I got it!

02:40.870 --> 02:42.537
Get to the open space!

02:50.378 --> 02:52.882
Order number 54, ready!

02:53.015 --> 02:55.885
Number 52, ready!

03:05.628 --> 03:07.230
- Hey!
- What are you doing, old man?!

03:07.362 --> 03:09.132
I'm stopping two punks
from ripping off my friend,

03:09.264 --> 03:11.801
or did you just forget to put
the money on the counter, huh?

03:11.934 --> 03:13.970
What are you, crazy?

03:14.103 --> 03:16.105
I don't think I'm crazy, son.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.373
There's a lot of people who do.

03:18.507 --> 03:20.676
You get your butts over there
and pay that woman.

03:20.810 --> 03:22.477
You're gonna wish you didn't
wake up this morning, old man.

03:22.612 --> 03:26.048
Oh, really?

03:28.450 --> 03:30.153
- Aah!
- Surprise!

03:31.721 --> 03:33.823
All right, son.

03:33.956 --> 03:36.259
I'm choking you out
in about 20 seconds.

03:36.391 --> 03:39.095
Nothing you can do about it
except pay for that food.

03:39.228 --> 03:40.630
I, I don't have any money.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.031
Neither of us do.

03:42.165 --> 03:44.432
Take your wallet out
and give it to me.

03:44.566 --> 03:47.402
Where is it? Let me have it.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.507
Oh, wait a minute.

03:52.642 --> 03:56.511
You're Ryan Brody?
You're Chuck's boy?

03:56.646 --> 03:58.480
So you gotta be
Nick Lewis, right?

03:58.614 --> 04:01.651
All right, fumble-wits,
this is how this is gonna go.

04:01.784 --> 04:03.886
I'm gonna pay for this food,

04:04.020 --> 04:07.489
and y'all are gonna look up
Sam Donovan on Crestline.

04:07.623 --> 04:10.626
If I get paid back
by tomorrow night,

04:10.760 --> 04:12.695
I won't have any reason
to call your fathers.

04:12.829 --> 04:16.199
We have an agreement?

04:16.331 --> 04:17.633
Do we have an agreement?!

04:17.767 --> 04:19.635
Yeah.
We have an agreement.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.704
You're learning.

04:21.838 --> 04:23.606
Maria.

04:23.739 --> 04:25.340
Hey, Sam.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.676
Here's your order.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.343
Okay, here's your money.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.645
Keep the change.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.714
Thank you.

04:31.848 --> 04:34.549
You know,
you didn't have to do that.

04:34.684 --> 04:36.652
Those two are probably
good kids.

04:36.786 --> 04:38.788
They just need
a little guidance.

04:38.921 --> 04:41.389
Yeah, well...
consider 'em guided.

04:49.031 --> 04:50.099
Come on, Newburn!

04:50.233 --> 04:52.034
No personal fouls!

04:52.168 --> 04:53.836
That number 48

04:53.970 --> 04:55.872
needs a kick in the butt
to clear his mind.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.439
Dad...

04:57.572 --> 04:58.674
Pretend I didn't say it.

04:58.808 --> 05:01.077
Oh, but we gotta do something.

05:01.210 --> 05:02.645
We're running out of time here.

05:05.014 --> 05:06.315
Hey, Brauner!

05:06.448 --> 05:09.018
You should be
out of the game for that!

05:09.151 --> 05:10.485
You ready
to go home yet, Hopkins?

05:13.388 --> 05:15.057
Kick it out, kick it out!

05:15.191 --> 05:16.759
- Good one, good one!
- Yes!

05:16.893 --> 05:18.661
They just have to win, Grampa.

05:18.794 --> 05:21.898
They have to make it
to the finals.

05:22.031 --> 05:23.699
Wish I could help them.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.034
Wait a minute.

05:25.167 --> 05:26.335
Aren't you the little girl

05:26.468 --> 05:29.272
that's always talking
to me about God?

05:29.404 --> 05:30.940
Well, maybe
you're on good terms with Him.

05:31.073 --> 05:33.843
Why don't you ask Him?
Maybe He'll do something.

05:35.011 --> 05:36.411
Okay, God.

05:36.544 --> 05:38.247
This one's for Danny's team.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.982
Please give my brother
the strength

05:40.116 --> 05:41.784
to kick harder and faster

05:41.918 --> 05:44.452
than anyone else
on that other stupid team.

05:46.055 --> 05:48.691
I... guess
maybe I shouldn't have said

05:48.824 --> 05:50.993
"stupid" in my prayer, huh?

05:53.229 --> 05:55.598
This one is
just sweeter than chocolate.

06:14.317 --> 06:16.786
Yeah! Go, Danny!

06:16.919 --> 06:19.155
My prayer worked!

06:19.288 --> 06:20.389
You see? I told you.

06:20.522 --> 06:22.992
Thank You, God.

06:25.895 --> 06:28.397
Okay, if we can just hold on
for another 21 more seconds,

06:28.530 --> 06:29.832
we're going to overtime.

06:29.966 --> 06:32.567
Pass it! I'm open, I'm open!

06:37.139 --> 06:41.277
Oh, come on! He tripped over me
on purpose! That's not a foul!

06:41.410 --> 06:43.646
Oh, come on, ref, a yellow card?
No way!

06:45.781 --> 06:47.283
What does that mean?

06:47.416 --> 06:48.918
It means that the Brauner kid

06:49.051 --> 06:50.485
just cheated his way
into a penalty kick,

06:50.619 --> 06:54.223
and if he makes it...
if he makes it, we lose.

06:54.357 --> 06:55.758
Come on, ref!

06:59.061 --> 07:00.129
Yeah...!

07:01.297 --> 07:03.199
Oh, no...

07:08.771 --> 07:12.375
Oh, nice try, Hopkins, but it's
pretty obvious you guys suck.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.680
But I thought you said

07:17.813 --> 07:19.682
if I prayed really hard,
we would win.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.718
No, I didn't say that, honey.

07:22.852 --> 07:25.855
I said that if you prayed
really hard, He might help.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.289
And He did, honey.

07:27.423 --> 07:28.891
Danny scored.

07:29.025 --> 07:30.659
Yeah, but they still lost,
Grampa.

07:30.793 --> 07:33.528
Didn't God want us to win?

07:33.662 --> 07:36.999
You know,
how God works is a mystery.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.935
I'm sure He heard your prayers
and He answered 'em,

07:40.069 --> 07:43.205
but maybe there was a reason
that Danny's team lost.

07:43.339 --> 07:44.907
You know,
like a reason more important

07:45.041 --> 07:46.308
than just winning a game?

07:47.276 --> 07:49.211
Okay.

07:49.345 --> 07:51.781
Well, I'm gonna go tell Danny
that he did great anyway.

07:51.914 --> 07:54.517
- Wanna go, Cindy?
- Sure.

07:56.986 --> 07:58.587
- Well..
- Okay...

07:58.721 --> 08:00.689
Well, are we still going over
to your place after, Dad?

08:00.823 --> 08:02.925
Yeah. Should I take the kids?

08:03.059 --> 08:04.627
Oh, thanks,
but I'm sure that Sara's

08:04.760 --> 08:06.028
gonna wanna go
with Cindy and Danny,

08:06.162 --> 08:07.963
so they can dance their way up.

08:08.097 --> 08:09.865
You can do that in a car?

08:11.400 --> 08:13.269
Don't ask.

If Danny goes with you.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.746
Great... oh, Sadie!

08:57.880 --> 08:59.682
Wanna go to the lake with me?

08:59.815 --> 09:01.650
Girl, are you trying
to steal my dog?

09:01.784 --> 09:04.453
Only for the day, Grampa.

09:04.588 --> 09:05.955
Well, you can have her
if you feed her.

09:06.088 --> 09:09.325
Mm, Sadie eats too much.

09:09.458 --> 09:10.960
We couldn't afford it.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.529
Why didn't I think of that?

09:13.662 --> 09:15.631
Danny, you played a great game
and I'm proud of you.

09:15.764 --> 09:16.866
You doing okay?

09:16.999 --> 09:18.267
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.568
I just...
can't believe that Alvie Brauner

09:19.702 --> 09:21.137
won the game off a cheap shot.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.272
- All the ref had to do was...
- Danny, come on.

09:23.405 --> 09:24.907
You said
you weren't gonna talk about it.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.409
You played great, honey,
and those guys were jerks.

09:27.543 --> 09:29.845
Not even worried about it.

09:33.115 --> 09:33.983
Go, Pitbulls!

09:34.116 --> 09:35.417
Nice shot.

09:35.551 --> 09:36.652
Showoff.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.521
It's only 'cause
I know you love it.

09:40.189 --> 09:41.323
Hey, that was a nice game,
Danny.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.491
Thanks, Grampa.

09:42.626 --> 09:43.659
Can we go to the lake?

09:43.792 --> 09:45.694
Whoa...

09:45.828 --> 09:47.730
I just ran in the game
for an hour and a half,

09:47.863 --> 09:49.498
and now you want me
to hike up there?

09:49.633 --> 09:52.101
Cindy wants to go.

09:52.234 --> 09:55.171
Yeah, I wanna go.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.172
Look at that.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.373
A guy doesn't stand a chance

09:57.506 --> 09:58.642
with these two around.

09:58.774 --> 10:00.242
You're learning.

10:00.376 --> 10:01.710
Come on.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.512
I'm gonna catch
a lot of fish today.

10:03.647 --> 10:04.947
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I think so.

10:05.080 --> 10:06.382
I brought my lucky pole
out here, so...

10:06.515 --> 10:07.983
- Oh...
- You brought that pole

10:08.117 --> 10:10.519
last time, and I caught
more than you and Grampa.

10:14.690 --> 10:16.759
Okay, well, you want Grampa's
seat in the grove

10:16.892 --> 10:18.894
or you want to try
this spot in the middle?

10:19.028 --> 10:21.665
Wait, you mean we're not gonna
fish together?

10:21.797 --> 10:26.335
Uh... no, I thought that Cindy
and I would try our luck alone.

10:26.468 --> 10:29.038
You know,
less people, more fish?

10:29.171 --> 10:32.541
Grampa told you
to keep an eye on <i>me.</i>

10:32.676 --> 10:34.710
I should be keeping an eye
on you two.

10:37.313 --> 10:40.115
Are you two gonna kiss?

10:40.249 --> 10:41.717
You think we should?

10:47.489 --> 10:50.025
Wait!

10:56.498 --> 10:59.101
Oh, no, the poor thing.

10:59.235 --> 11:02.004
I wonder what happened?

11:02.137 --> 11:04.139
I, I don't think you should be
touching it, Sara.

11:04.273 --> 11:05.474
It's okay.

11:05.609 --> 11:07.109
It doesn't look dirty.

11:07.243 --> 11:09.613
There's no bugs on it
or anything.

11:09.745 --> 11:11.715
It's dead.

11:11.847 --> 11:12.781
You want to bury it?

11:12.915 --> 11:14.283
No.

11:14.416 --> 11:17.052
It might not be dead.

11:21.123 --> 11:23.693
It's heart isn't beating, Sara,
and it feels cold.

11:23.826 --> 11:25.928
It's dead.

11:26.061 --> 11:29.865
Maybe if we pray,
he'll come back to life.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.967
Sara, the bird is dead.

11:32.101 --> 11:33.637
Nothing can bring him back.

11:33.769 --> 11:35.137
Lazarus was dead for four days

11:35.271 --> 11:37.607
and Jesus brought him
back to life.

11:37.741 --> 11:41.510
But... Jesus isn't here and...
the bird isn't Lazarus.

11:41.645 --> 11:43.178
God is always here.

11:43.312 --> 11:46.081
Well... I don't see Him.

11:46.215 --> 11:49.586
But we have to have faith
in miracles.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.390
Will you talk
some sense into her?

11:54.523 --> 11:56.760
Maybe we should leave her alone.

11:56.892 --> 12:00.462
Have a little faith
and let her pray.

12:00.597 --> 12:03.165
Okay, but she's gonna have about
as much luck moving those trees

12:03.299 --> 12:04.701
as she will
bringing that bird back.

12:04.833 --> 12:06.869
It's not gonna happen.

12:07.002 --> 12:09.673
Sara.

12:09.805 --> 12:12.141
Sorry about the bird but...

12:12.274 --> 12:14.376
death is a part of life.

12:14.510 --> 12:17.246
You can spend the day
any way you want, Sara.

12:17.379 --> 12:19.515
We'll be over at the cedars
if you need us.

12:20.849 --> 12:22.117
Come on.

12:29.992 --> 12:31.695
God...

12:31.860 --> 12:37.333
You made this poor little guy,
so maybe You can help him out.

12:37.466 --> 12:40.670
His family's probably
missing him, don't You think?

12:40.804 --> 12:44.674
You wouldn't want them
to be sad, would You?

12:44.808 --> 12:49.646
Please bring him back.

12:49.779 --> 12:56.452
Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be...

13:10.899 --> 13:12.501
Not bad.

13:12.635 --> 13:16.105
Should hold us for dinner.

13:18.808 --> 13:19.875
All set?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.343
All right, let's go.

13:29.218 --> 13:32.187
Hey, did you
catch anything?

13:35.324 --> 13:36.892
Come on, Sara, we have to go.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.061
Look, I offered
to help you bury it.

13:39.194 --> 13:40.864
Come on, Sara.

13:40.996 --> 13:42.431
Your mom's not gonna like it
if you're late for dinner.

13:42.564 --> 13:45.567
Do you see Him?

13:45.702 --> 13:47.936
Who?

13:48.070 --> 13:50.707
God.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.040
Do you see Him?

13:54.910 --> 13:56.780
Come on, Sara,
that's not funny.

13:56.912 --> 13:58.414
There.

13:59.816 --> 14:01.751
Show me where He is.

14:01.885 --> 14:03.919
You don't see Him?

14:04.052 --> 14:06.455
He's floating over the water.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.126
Sara, we have to go.

14:25.107 --> 14:26.575
Did you see that?

14:27.911 --> 14:30.145
Maybe... the wind woke it up?

14:30.279 --> 14:32.147
The wind?

14:32.281 --> 14:34.283
It didn't have a heartbeat
and it was cold.

14:34.416 --> 14:37.386
God brought it back to life.

14:39.889 --> 14:43.358
Come on, guys,
Cindy's right, we gotta go.

14:43.492 --> 14:46.663
We don't want Mom
to get mad at us.

15:05.013 --> 15:06.716
Can I help?

15:06.850 --> 15:09.485
You sure can.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.621
You catch any fish?

15:11.754 --> 15:13.121
No.

15:13.255 --> 15:14.657
Oh, well,
you better tell your mother

15:14.791 --> 15:16.759
to take some meat
out of the freezer

15:16.893 --> 15:18.494
and put it in the microwave.

15:18.628 --> 15:19.963
We don't have to.

15:20.095 --> 15:21.965
Danny and Cindy caught some.

15:22.097 --> 15:23.666
And you didn't?

15:23.800 --> 15:25.167
That doesn't sound like you.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.002
We found a dead bird.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.303
Oh, good!
Are we gonna eat that?

15:28.437 --> 15:31.173
No, Grampa.

15:32.775 --> 15:34.878
I set him free.

15:35.010 --> 15:36.579
Honey...

15:36.713 --> 15:40.182
If he was dead, he's as free
as he's ever gonna be.

15:40.315 --> 15:43.318
He was alive when I let him go.

15:43.452 --> 15:45.889
Well, I must be
getting old, dear.

15:46.021 --> 15:48.323
Didn't you tell me he was dead?

15:48.457 --> 15:51.594
And then he came back to life?

15:51.728 --> 15:54.664
When I found the bird, I prayed.

15:54.797 --> 15:56.532
Like you told me to do
at the soccer game?

15:56.666 --> 15:58.534
- Uh-huh.
- But then...

15:58.668 --> 16:01.771
I saw God standing
on the other side of the lake,

16:01.905 --> 16:04.206
and the bird flapped his wings
and I let him go.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.275
Well...

16:06.408 --> 16:09.579
I always thought that place
was special, honey...

16:09.712 --> 16:11.513
and I always thought
you were kinda special.

16:11.648 --> 16:14.049
How, how long were you praying?

16:14.182 --> 16:15.618
As long as we were up there.

16:15.752 --> 16:17.987
You were on your knees
the whole time?

16:18.120 --> 16:20.023
Yup.

16:20.155 --> 16:22.057
Sara, you're
an amazing little girl.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.559
Did you tell your mother?

16:23.693 --> 16:25.093
Yeah.

16:25.227 --> 16:26.896
Yeah? What'd she say?

16:27.030 --> 16:29.933
She said, "That's nice, honey."

16:30.065 --> 16:33.201
She probably didn't hear me.

16:33.335 --> 16:34.837
She wouldn't have
believed me anyway.

16:34.971 --> 16:37.472
You know, I can understand that.

16:37.607 --> 16:39.575
Maybe you just ought to
keep this between us

16:39.709 --> 16:41.678
for the next little while.

16:41.811 --> 16:43.913
Not everybody's
as smart as I am.

16:44.047 --> 16:46.583
They might think
you just made it up.

16:46.716 --> 16:49.084
But I'm telling the truth.

16:49.217 --> 16:51.420
Danny and Cindy
saw it come back to life.

16:51.553 --> 16:53.723
They did, huh?

16:53.856 --> 16:57.026
Well... I believe you, hon.

16:57.159 --> 16:58.728
Are you coming back
next weekend?

16:58.861 --> 17:00.630
- I want to.
- Uh-huh.

17:00.763 --> 17:03.066
I'll talk to your mama.

17:03.198 --> 17:05.267
Grampa...

17:05.400 --> 17:08.136
are you ever gonna
get married again?

17:08.270 --> 17:10.472
Oh, dear.

17:10.607 --> 17:13.275
Honey, the Lord
gave me your grandma,

17:13.408 --> 17:17.080
and she put up with me
more than I deserved.

17:17.212 --> 17:19.983
I'm not gonna push the issue.

17:20.115 --> 17:21.985
You look young for a grampa.

17:22.117 --> 17:23.953
Yeah, and you look so cute,

17:24.087 --> 17:26.756
you make my heart hop
like a little bunny.

17:26.889 --> 17:28.190
Not really.

17:28.323 --> 17:29.592
Yes, really.

17:29.726 --> 17:30.760
You know what?

17:30.893 --> 17:34.496
Today... I love you this much.

17:34.631 --> 17:37.165
You love me more than that.

17:37.299 --> 17:39.102
Maybe that much.

17:41.303 --> 17:45.173
Well, I love you this much,
and even more.

17:45.307 --> 17:47.677
Well... you wait till dinner,

17:47.810 --> 17:51.346
when I steal some of your mama's
sweet potatoes off your plate.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.116
See how much you love me then.

18:04.927 --> 18:05.795
Hello?

18:05.928 --> 18:06.929
Hey.

18:07.063 --> 18:09.431
Whose phone are you using?

18:09.564 --> 18:11.566
<i>I borrowed my brother's.</i>

18:11.701 --> 18:12.802
Borrowed?

18:12.935 --> 18:15.504
Well, something like that.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.874
Okay, so, the coolest thing
happened at the lake today.

18:18.007 --> 18:19.976
<i>Yeah, like what?</i>

18:20.109 --> 18:22.945
Me and Danny and Cindy
went fishing.

18:23.079 --> 18:24.312
Well, they did.

18:24.446 --> 18:25.514
I didn't, because...

18:25.648 --> 18:27.650
<i>I found a dead bird.</i>

18:27.784 --> 18:29.551
<i>And then I prayed...</i>

18:29.686 --> 18:33.555
and then I saw God, and He
brought the bird back to life.

18:33.690 --> 18:34.991
What?

18:35.124 --> 18:36.491
It really happened, Mark.

18:36.626 --> 18:38.293
<i>Okay, so,
let me get this straight.</i>

18:38.427 --> 18:41.664
You saw God
and then brought a dead bird...

18:41.798 --> 18:42.865
<i>back to life.</i>

18:42.999 --> 18:44.433
No, I didn't.
God did.

18:44.566 --> 18:46.169
Come on...

18:46.301 --> 18:47.269
<i>you're playing with me.</i>

18:47.402 --> 18:48.771
I'm not, Mark.

18:48.905 --> 18:51.239
I'm telling you
because you're my best friend.

18:51.373 --> 18:54.877
Okay, so, if you saw God,
then what did He look like?

18:55.011 --> 18:57.914
He was surrounded by
a large ball of light at first,

18:58.047 --> 19:00.282
so He was kinda hard to see.

19:00.415 --> 19:03.920
But then He stepped
out of the light and...

19:04.053 --> 19:06.823
He looked young and... kind.

19:06.956 --> 19:09.324
<i>But I think He was wearing
a t-shirt and jeans.</i>

19:09.458 --> 19:10.693
Come on.

19:10.827 --> 19:12.929
God doesn't wear
t-shirts and jeans.

19:13.062 --> 19:14.063
How do you know?

19:14.197 --> 19:15.430
Have <i>you</i> ever seen Him?

19:15.564 --> 19:16.766
No.

19:16.899 --> 19:18.768
<i>It was God...</i>

19:18.901 --> 19:21.904
and He did bring that bird
back to life.

19:22.038 --> 19:25.507
<i>Danny and Cindy saw it happen,
and they don't even believe it.</i>

19:25.641 --> 19:27.176
<i>They told Mom at dinner...</i>

19:27.309 --> 19:30.479
that it was probably some weird
reflection on the water,

19:30.613 --> 19:33.649
or that the bird was probably
stunned or sick...

19:33.783 --> 19:35.151
<i>but not dead.</i>

19:35.283 --> 19:37.452
Well... maybe they're right.

19:37.587 --> 19:38.453
<i>Mark...</i>

19:38.588 --> 19:39.756
I promise!

19:39.889 --> 19:41.389
God <i>was</i> there.

19:41.523 --> 19:42.725
Really?

19:42.859 --> 19:44.761
I swear on the Bible itself.

19:44.894 --> 19:46.696
Whoa!

19:46.829 --> 19:48.765
This is so awesome!

19:48.898 --> 19:50.265
Uh, I, I...

19:50.398 --> 19:51.466
<i>believe you!</i>

19:51.601 --> 19:53.202
That's what happened.

19:53.335 --> 19:56.139
Um... but...
I wouldn't tell anyone,

19:56.271 --> 19:58.975
because people will just think
I'm crazy, and...

20:00.275 --> 20:01.510
Uh, gotta go.

20:01.644 --> 20:02.745
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:02.879 --> 20:04.580
All right.

20:06.481 --> 20:07.950
Hi, honey.

20:08.084 --> 20:09.484
Did you brush your teeth
and floss?

20:09.619 --> 20:11.087
Sure did.

20:11.220 --> 20:12.655
Good stuff.

20:16.759 --> 20:17.860
Okay.

20:17.994 --> 20:20.495
This is my favorite part
of the day.

20:20.630 --> 20:23.666
All right, so,
you're gonna close your eyes

20:23.800 --> 20:26.501
and then you're gonna think
about all the things

20:26.636 --> 20:28.604
that you're grateful for
that happened today.

20:28.738 --> 20:31.140
Mom?

20:31.274 --> 20:33.709
Yes, sweetheart?

20:33.843 --> 20:37.613
That bird really did come
back to life at the lake.

20:37.747 --> 20:40.583
It was right after I saw God.

20:40.716 --> 20:44.654
It wasn't some weird reflection
or anything like that, no.

20:44.787 --> 20:50.660
It really was God,
and He spoke to me.

20:50.793 --> 20:52.795
What did He say?

20:52.929 --> 20:55.631
He said He'll be
taking me to Heaven soon.

20:58.466 --> 21:01.003
Honey...

21:01.137 --> 21:04.841
You have to die to go to Heaven.

21:04.974 --> 21:09.344
I don't wanna die, but...
I wanna go to Heaven.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.782
Well, I don't intend
on letting you go anywhere

21:12.915 --> 21:14.549
for a very long time, okay?

21:14.684 --> 21:16.886
You have a lot of time
to get to Heaven,

21:17.019 --> 21:18.721
and when you finally go there,

21:18.855 --> 21:20.590
you're gonna be
an old, old, old, old lady.

21:20.723 --> 21:22.091
Much older than me.

21:22.225 --> 21:24.392
Okay?

21:24.526 --> 21:27.296
No more talk about dying.

21:28.598 --> 21:29.866
All right,
you gotta get some sleep.

21:29.999 --> 21:31.234
You have school
in the morning, okay?

21:31.366 --> 21:32.235
So say your prayers.

21:32.367 --> 21:33.769
Okay.

21:33.903 --> 21:37.273
Can I got back to Grampa's
next weekend?

21:37.405 --> 21:39.041
Only if you stop
letting your imagination

21:39.175 --> 21:41.010
get the better of you.

21:41.143 --> 21:42.510
Okay?

21:45.047 --> 21:46.849
- Love you.
- Love you.

21:46.983 --> 21:49.151
Sweet dreams, baby.

22:08.170 --> 22:09.872
Mom, Dad.

22:10.006 --> 22:12.108
Hey, buddy,
is everything okay?

22:12.241 --> 22:13.943
I went to Sara's room
to see if she had my phone,

22:14.076 --> 22:15.678
and she looks really sick.
You need to come.

22:15.811 --> 22:17.545
- How sick?
- I don't know.

22:17.680 --> 22:19.181
She's covered in sweat
and breathing pretty hard.

22:19.315 --> 22:20.482
It's not good.

22:34.830 --> 22:36.399
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey.

22:36.531 --> 22:37.967
- Thanks for coming out so late.
- No, no.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.835
No problem, I get it.

22:42.038 --> 22:44.707
Oh, Ben, I'm so happy
that you're here.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.309
She's been running
a really high fever,

22:46.441 --> 22:48.543
and now she says
that she's nauseous.

22:48.678 --> 22:49.979
All right, uh,
let me take a look.

22:50.112 --> 22:52.315
Hi, Sara.

22:52.447 --> 22:55.450
Can you tell me
how you're feeling right now?

22:55.584 --> 22:56.953
- Not so good.
- Mm.

22:57.086 --> 22:59.322
I feel really sick,
like I'm gonna throw up.

22:59.454 --> 23:00.790
Don't you worry.

23:00.923 --> 23:04.160
We're gonna fix you
right up, Sara.

23:04.293 --> 23:05.493
I think she has a stomach flu.

23:05.628 --> 23:07.363
Uh, it's going around.

23:07.495 --> 23:09.265
Just keep her home tomorrow
and keep her hydrated.

23:09.398 --> 23:11.634
Thanks, we will.

23:11.767 --> 23:14.904
It's just that something
she said scared me.

23:16.405 --> 23:18.240
What was that?

23:19.442 --> 23:21.577
Go ahead, tell him.

23:23.112 --> 23:25.547
When we visited my dad
at the lake,

23:25.681 --> 23:27.817
she said she saw God...

23:27.950 --> 23:31.253
and that He brought
a dead bird back to life.

23:31.387 --> 23:33.322
Well, that, that just sounds

23:33.456 --> 23:36.025
like she has a healthy
imagination to me.

23:36.158 --> 23:38.127
But then she said
that God spoke to her...

23:38.260 --> 23:41.563
and He told her He was gonna be
taking her to Heaven soon.

23:43.966 --> 23:45.701
She's gonna be fine.

23:45.835 --> 23:47.535
All right?
She's healthier than all of us.

23:47.670 --> 23:48.871
It's nothing to worry about.

23:49.005 --> 23:51.207
It's gonna be okay.

23:51.340 --> 23:54.043
- Ben, thanks for coming out.
- All right, no problem.

23:54.176 --> 23:56.012
Oh, and, you know, if she gets
worse, her temperature rises,

23:56.145 --> 23:57.146
just call my office.

23:57.279 --> 23:59.682
- Will do.
- Thank you.

24:03.652 --> 24:05.287
Hey, peanut.

24:05.421 --> 24:06.989
You feeling any better?

24:07.123 --> 24:08.724
I think so.

24:08.858 --> 24:11.027
Well, you get some sleep.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.995
I'm sure you'll feel...

24:13.129 --> 24:14.597
Oh... sorry.

24:19.935 --> 24:21.837
Where'd you get this?

24:21.971 --> 24:24.807
I drew it
when I came home tonight.

24:24.940 --> 24:28.010
- You drew this?
- Yeah.

24:28.144 --> 24:31.580
I drew it with the drawing kit
Grampa gave me for Christmas.

24:31.714 --> 24:33.315
Huh.

24:35.384 --> 24:37.253
Huh.

24:40.356 --> 24:43.959
Sara, I, I've never seen you
do anything like this before.

24:44.093 --> 24:45.461
Where'd you learn to do this?

24:45.594 --> 24:46.929
I don't know.

24:47.063 --> 24:48.563
I just felt like
trying to make a picture

24:48.697 --> 24:50.232
of what I saw at the lake.

24:50.366 --> 24:54.537
Sara, this isn't trying, this...
this is incredible.

24:54.670 --> 24:56.739
- Thanks.
- Can I show this to your mom?

24:56.872 --> 24:58.107
Sure.

24:59.608 --> 25:02.078
Okay, well... we're gonna
keep you home tomorrow,

25:02.211 --> 25:03.712
so you get some sleep.

25:03.846 --> 25:06.449
And I...
promise to return it, okay?

25:06.582 --> 25:08.184
Good night, Dad.

25:08.317 --> 25:09.285
Night, sweetheart.

25:28.871 --> 25:31.340
Who did this?

25:31.474 --> 25:34.477
Your daughter did.

25:34.610 --> 25:38.047
No... she couldn't have.

25:38.180 --> 25:39.915
But she did.

25:50.059 --> 25:52.962
You didn't really miss
anything in class yesterday.

25:53.095 --> 25:56.966
You know, same old stuff, and,
luckily, no math quiz either.

25:57.099 --> 26:00.503
I felt fine, but my mom wanted
to keep me in bed all day.

26:00.636 --> 26:03.873
So... I... drew you something.

26:04.006 --> 26:05.609
Oh, yeah, like what?

26:06.942 --> 26:09.613
Sara!

26:09.745 --> 26:11.747
You drew this?

26:11.881 --> 26:13.949
This is unbelievable!

26:14.083 --> 26:16.819
Our art teacher could never
pull off a drawing like this.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.054
- How'd you do it?
- I don't know.

26:19.188 --> 26:21.857
I guess I just found
something I'm good at.

26:29.165 --> 26:31.167
- Oh, man.
- Here are these fools.

26:32.935 --> 26:34.403
Hey, Sara.

26:34.537 --> 26:35.671
My cat died last week.

26:35.804 --> 26:37.039
I was wondering
if you could stop by

26:37.173 --> 26:38.274
and bring him back to life.

26:39.475 --> 26:40.610
My frog died last night.

26:40.743 --> 26:42.011
Could you bring him back too?

26:42.144 --> 26:43.647
- Oh, so pathetic.
- I thought I told you

26:43.779 --> 26:45.314
not to tell anyone
about what happened at the lake.

26:45.447 --> 26:47.049
Oh, and I have
a goldfish!

26:47.183 --> 26:48.751
Maybe if you changed
some water into wine,

26:48.884 --> 26:50.186
we could get the fish
really drunk.

26:50.319 --> 26:51.754
That would be awesome.

26:51.887 --> 26:56.325
No one messes with
my little sister... no one.

26:56.458 --> 26:57.993
What a weirdo.

27:04.233 --> 27:06.368
Didn't your parents ever
tell you not to pick on girls?

27:06.502 --> 27:08.871
Obviously not.

27:13.275 --> 27:15.579
Weren't we always taught
that if someone wrongs you,

27:15.711 --> 27:17.581
to turn the other cheek?

27:17.713 --> 27:20.684
Well... they were certainly
taught something about a cheek.

27:20.816 --> 27:22.952
Maybe that guy could tell you
more about it.

27:31.794 --> 27:33.429
What the hell, man?

27:46.710 --> 27:49.613
Oh... I got this.

27:50.846 --> 27:53.415
Well, well, well...

27:53.549 --> 27:55.619
if it isn't
the would-be soccer hero.

27:55.751 --> 27:57.553
What's the matter, boy?

27:57.687 --> 27:58.954
You still trying to make up

27:59.088 --> 28:00.756
for your pathetic game
the other day?

28:00.889 --> 28:03.759
Wow, your dog is really pretty.

28:06.262 --> 28:07.796
Stay away from him, Sara.

28:07.930 --> 28:10.466
The dog's probably
just as jacked up as his master.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.800
Here.

28:17.940 --> 28:19.908
And what are you
gonna do now, Hopkins?

28:20.042 --> 28:21.844
Call a foul?

28:21.977 --> 28:23.846
Come on, Danny,
let's get outta here.

28:23.979 --> 28:26.650
I'm sure the air is fresher
on the other side of the street.

28:29.586 --> 28:32.421
Yeah, that's right, Hopkins,
just run away.

28:32.554 --> 28:33.922
Just keep hiding
behind the skirts

28:34.056 --> 28:36.292
of your girlfriend
and your little sister!

28:42.766 --> 28:44.768
Just run away, Hopkins!

28:44.900 --> 28:47.503
You and that crippled kid too!

28:47.637 --> 28:49.405
You know what?

28:49.538 --> 28:52.141
Somebody ought to teach you to
keep your mouth shut, Brauner.

28:52.274 --> 28:54.376
And who would that be?

28:54.510 --> 28:57.946
Alvie, look out!

29:03.218 --> 29:05.287
Man, what's the matter
with you?!

29:05.421 --> 29:06.955
You almost took me out, fool!

29:07.089 --> 29:08.824
Why weren't you
watching the road?!

29:08.957 --> 29:10.392
Are you outta your mind?

29:16.633 --> 29:19.602
Oh, no... no...

29:19.736 --> 29:21.870
No, no, no, no, no...

29:22.004 --> 29:23.372
Nobby, get up, man.

29:23.505 --> 29:24.473
Get up, Nobby.

29:24.607 --> 29:26.342
Get up.

29:30.312 --> 29:32.147
You killed my dog, man.

29:32.281 --> 29:34.718
- You killed my dog, man.
- Alvie, hold up!

29:34.850 --> 29:35.984
- It was an accident.
- I'm gonna break your head!

29:36.118 --> 29:37.553
Calm down, man, back off.

29:37.687 --> 29:39.021
That dog was my best friend,
and you killed him.

29:39.154 --> 29:40.022
- Come on, man...
- That's it, man.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.591
I'm gonna finish you.

29:41.725 --> 29:43.025
You're not gonna help
anything by doing this.

29:43.158 --> 29:45.194
Hey, tell her to keep her hands
off my dog.

29:45.327 --> 29:47.930
- Come on...
- Don't.

29:48.063 --> 29:52.534
Dear God... You helped
that little bird at the lake.

29:52.669 --> 29:55.839
Can you please help
this poor dog too?

29:58.073 --> 30:01.811
Our Father...
who art in Heaven...

30:01.944 --> 30:04.647
hallowed be Thy name...

30:26.902 --> 30:29.571
Go on.

30:45.554 --> 30:47.724
And then...
when he just started breathing,

30:47.857 --> 30:49.525
I just couldn't believe it.

30:49.659 --> 30:53.630
I mean, I've never seen
anything like that.

30:53.763 --> 30:55.931
Sara...

30:56.064 --> 30:57.600
can I ask you something?

30:57.734 --> 31:00.135
Sure.

31:00.269 --> 31:02.938
Do you think
you could help me walk again?

31:03.071 --> 31:04.940
I don't know.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.375
Maybe.

31:09.344 --> 31:11.480
Could you say a prayer for me?

31:20.924 --> 31:25.461
God... Mark's a good guy.

31:25.595 --> 31:28.330
He really is.

31:28.464 --> 31:31.701
Maybe You could help him
walk again?

31:31.835 --> 31:33.803
Could You do that, please?

31:41.510 --> 31:44.948
I'll pray for you more
when I get home too.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.649
See you, Mark.

31:46.783 --> 31:48.217
Okay, thanks.

31:48.350 --> 31:50.986
See you tomorrow.

32:03.967 --> 32:07.369
Hey, you took me away
from my golf game.

32:07.503 --> 32:09.973
So... tell me what this
medical emergency is all about.

32:10.105 --> 32:13.509
I moved my toes this morning.

32:13.643 --> 32:16.144
No, he really did, Doc.

32:16.278 --> 32:17.914
Which foot?

32:18.046 --> 32:19.314
Both!

32:22.017 --> 32:24.453
Show me.

32:25.989 --> 32:28.156
Ready?

32:32.662 --> 32:36.298
Mark, uh... I, I don't know...
what happened,

32:36.431 --> 32:38.001
but your
spinal cord injury isn't...

32:38.133 --> 32:39.201
Wait!

32:39.334 --> 32:41.403
Just... give me a chance.

32:43.505 --> 32:44.874
Please.

33:08.564 --> 33:10.065
Can, can you move
the other foot?

33:28.885 --> 33:30.218
Here you go.

33:30.352 --> 33:31.420
Thanks, Doc.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.155
So, listen...

33:33.288 --> 33:36.458
Doc, you really think
he's got a chance, right?

33:36.593 --> 33:38.260
Look, I, I...

33:38.393 --> 33:40.529
I can't explain what,
what happened in there...

33:40.663 --> 33:44.533
but... severed nerves
in spinal cord can't regenerate,

33:44.667 --> 33:47.235
and I just, I just don't want
to get your hopes up too much.

33:47.369 --> 33:49.237
Oh, hey, Ben.

33:49.371 --> 33:51.106
Hey, isn't...
that's Dolores Clark

33:51.239 --> 33:53.141
from Channel 12 News, right?

33:53.275 --> 33:55.444
Yes, she's, uh,
she's one of my patients.

33:57.614 --> 34:00.315
Mom?

34:03.586 --> 34:04.921
Oh, my baby!

34:05.054 --> 34:06.455
You're...

34:06.589 --> 34:08.725
walking and...

34:08.858 --> 34:09.993
He's standing!

34:10.125 --> 34:13.261
He's walking, look at him!

34:13.395 --> 34:15.064
It's a miracle!

34:15.230 --> 34:16.833
Oh, my...

34:16.966 --> 34:19.802
Oh, my baby.

34:19.936 --> 34:21.604
Isn't that the Miller boy?

34:21.738 --> 34:24.373
I did the story on him last year
when he was hit by that car.

34:24.506 --> 34:25.842
I thought he was
never supposed to walk again.

34:27.677 --> 34:30.813
He, he wasn't.

34:33.148 --> 34:34.584
It, it was Sara.

34:34.717 --> 34:37.954
Sara Hopkins.

34:38.087 --> 34:41.991
She speaks with God,
she brought a bird back to life,

34:42.125 --> 34:45.260
and Alvie Brauner's dog,
and now...

34:45.394 --> 34:47.697
she's healed me!

34:50.633 --> 34:51.533
Uh, Dolores...

34:51.668 --> 34:52.969
Don't do it!

34:53.102 --> 34:54.704
Are you kidding me?

34:54.837 --> 34:56.571
A little girl who brings dead
animals back to life

34:56.706 --> 34:58.340
and then heals a paraplegic kid?

34:58.473 --> 34:59.676
Like that's not news.

34:59.809 --> 35:01.309
Just get the facts first.

35:01.443 --> 35:03.579
Well, I just did.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.985
Come on... no!

35:09.118 --> 35:10.787
Got you again.

35:10.920 --> 35:11.954
Hi, guys.

35:12.088 --> 35:14.891
Look who came to say hi.

35:15.024 --> 35:17.292
Mom, you didn't have to
call the doctor.

35:17.426 --> 35:18.961
I told you I was feeling better.

35:19.095 --> 35:21.463
Yeah... yeah, we're here
on another matter, Sara,

35:21.597 --> 35:26.401
but why don't I have a...
quick look at you anyway, okay?

35:26.535 --> 35:27.670
How do you feel?

35:27.804 --> 35:29.438
- Okay now.
- Mm-hmm.

35:29.571 --> 35:31.941
Yesterday I came home
with a terrible headache

35:32.075 --> 35:33.910
and I was tired all day.

35:34.043 --> 35:36.478
Well, maybe you still have
a touch of the flu.

35:36.612 --> 35:40.415
Sara... when was the last time
you saw Mark Miller?

35:40.549 --> 35:41.718
Yesterday.

35:41.851 --> 35:43.820
I walked home with him.

35:43.953 --> 35:45.722
Did anything happen with Mark?

35:45.855 --> 35:48.191
Anything unusual?

35:48.323 --> 35:50.693
Well, he asked me
to pray for him,

35:50.827 --> 35:53.129
so I closed my eyes
and I asked God to heal him.

35:56.264 --> 35:57.967
Mark Miller walked today.

35:58.101 --> 35:59.534
Really?

35:59.669 --> 36:03.371
Awesome, my prayers worked!

36:03.505 --> 36:05.608
Yeah, seems like
he's gonna make a full recovery.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.111
Can you tell us a little more

36:08.243 --> 36:10.179
about what happened at the lake
the other day?

36:10.312 --> 36:11.881
Sure.

36:12.014 --> 36:15.051
I was praying for a little bird
that Danny said was dead.

36:15.184 --> 36:18.921
But then I saw God
floating over the lake

36:19.055 --> 36:21.456
and I asked him to cure
the bird, and He did.

36:21.591 --> 36:23.458
Do you speak to God often?

36:23.593 --> 36:26.394
All the time, don't you?

36:26.528 --> 36:28.296
Well... not directly.

36:28.430 --> 36:31.734
Not even in church?

36:31.868 --> 36:36.672
Look, um, it's, it's not healthy
or fair to other people

36:36.806 --> 36:39.041
to pretend that you're actually
having conversations with God.

36:39.175 --> 36:41.409
I'm not pretending.

36:41.543 --> 36:43.813
Okay.

36:43.946 --> 36:46.215
Bring her
to the office tomorrow.

36:46.348 --> 36:48.084
Fatigue and headaches
with someone her age, uh,

36:48.217 --> 36:51.053
really need to be
examined, okay?

36:52.255 --> 36:54.023
You need to talk to her.

36:54.157 --> 36:55.758
I mean,
stories about healing birds

36:55.892 --> 36:58.127
and making paralyzed boys
walk again

36:58.261 --> 36:59.862
is gonna turn her life
into a media circus.

36:59.996 --> 37:01.731
Look, Ben,
I understand all of that,

37:01.864 --> 37:03.365
but, seriously, do you have
a logical explanation

37:03.498 --> 37:04.801
for Mark's recovery?

37:04.934 --> 37:06.468
I can assure you there is one.

37:06.602 --> 37:08.570
However, at the moment,
we have no idea what it is.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.640
Don't be pouring fuel
on the fire, Jerry.

37:10.773 --> 37:12.407
I mean, Sara doesn't need that.

37:12.541 --> 37:14.243
Look, I, I don't know
exactly what happened,

37:14.376 --> 37:17.079
but I do know Sara believes
everything she's telling us.

37:17.213 --> 37:18.681
Look, I know she has
a very vivid imagination,

37:18.815 --> 37:20.583
but she would never
outright lie.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.084
She just wouldn't do
something like that.

37:22.218 --> 37:23.451
Let's, let's just keep this
between us

37:23.586 --> 37:25.788
until we get
to the bottom of it, okay?

37:27.455 --> 37:30.325
Right now,
I'm worried about her health.

37:32.829 --> 37:35.397
See you tomorrow after school.

37:44.339 --> 37:46.175
Hey.

37:48.510 --> 37:49.679
Did you see Sara?

37:49.812 --> 37:51.346
Yeah.

37:51.479 --> 37:52.682
And?

37:54.183 --> 37:55.550
She's just a little girl,

37:55.685 --> 37:57.153
and she's got people
all riled up

37:57.286 --> 37:59.055
with these make-believe stories
she's been telling.

38:00.223 --> 38:02.325
I know you're mad at Him.

38:02.457 --> 38:03.860
At who?

38:03.993 --> 38:05.161
God.

38:05.294 --> 38:07.495
Oh, please.

38:10.700 --> 38:13.803
Jesse was my son too, Ben.

38:13.936 --> 38:16.571
But I'm not as strong
as you are.

38:16.706 --> 38:19.342
Because if I quit
believing in God...

38:19.474 --> 38:22.178
then I have to believe
that our son no longer exists.

38:22.311 --> 38:24.814
I can't do that.

38:24.947 --> 38:27.783
I'm not that strong.

38:27.917 --> 38:30.586
And I don't think
you really are, either.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.122
Sara doesn't need
you and everyone else

38:33.256 --> 38:35.791
thinking that she's
an instrument of God.

38:35.925 --> 38:37.392
Why not?

38:37.525 --> 38:39.561
A little girl
with a strong faith

38:39.695 --> 38:42.698
is something
that we could all use more of.

38:42.832 --> 38:45.167
If there really was a God,

38:45.301 --> 38:47.270
would He create a world
where parents have to watch

38:47.402 --> 38:49.605
their sons and daughters die?

38:53.242 --> 38:54.442
Oh, great.

38:56.879 --> 38:58.446
<i>...get up and walk.</i>

38:58.581 --> 39:01.050
<i>He said a little girl,
Sara Hopkins,</i>

39:01.183 --> 39:03.619
<i>held his hands
and prayed for him.</i>

39:03.753 --> 39:06.289
<i>But can she really cure people
by praying?</i>

39:06.421 --> 39:08.958
<i>I'm afraid that's a bit hard
for me to believe.</i>

39:09.091 --> 39:10.793
<i>Yet the real question is...</i>

39:10.927 --> 39:14.230
<i>what do each of</i> you <i>believe?</i>

39:14.363 --> 39:16.232
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hi.

39:16.365 --> 39:17.532
What you doing?

39:17.667 --> 39:20.435
Drawing.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.570
Yeah...

39:22.705 --> 39:24.307
Huh.

39:24.439 --> 39:27.043
Uh...

39:27.176 --> 39:29.812
Yes, you are.

39:32.315 --> 39:34.750
Sara, sweetheart, look at me.

39:34.884 --> 39:36.819
Yeah?

39:36.953 --> 39:39.454
Uh, is there something that...

39:41.958 --> 39:45.493
Never mind.

39:45.628 --> 39:47.096
Tell me about your picture.

39:47.229 --> 39:49.732
Do you know that little boy?

39:49.865 --> 39:51.334
I'm not sure.

39:51.466 --> 39:53.002
It just came to me, you know?

39:53.135 --> 39:55.503
Almost like a dream.

39:55.638 --> 39:58.573
But I do know that it's,
it's not a boy.

39:58.708 --> 40:00.676
- Oh.
- It's a young girl.

40:00.810 --> 40:03.045
Maybe from my school.

40:03.179 --> 40:06.849
I think she wants to be
friends with me.

40:09.652 --> 40:11.620
Yeah...

40:21.897 --> 40:25.601
Theresa...
there's someone here to see you.

40:27.236 --> 40:28.838
Uncle Alonzo!

40:32.041 --> 40:33.876
I'll just be out
in the living room.

40:34.010 --> 40:35.378
You two have fun.

40:42.218 --> 40:44.387
Is there a story
that goes along with him too?

40:44.519 --> 40:46.222
Oh, you bet.

40:46.355 --> 40:51.160
Now, this guy... won the Grand
National Steeplechase twice.

40:51.293 --> 40:54.529
He was so good,
they had to ask him to retire,

40:54.663 --> 40:59.035
but he said he'd only do it
if he could live at your house.

40:59.168 --> 41:01.404
Your stories are the best.

41:05.007 --> 41:10.279
I just wish I'd be around
long enough to play with him.

41:16.185 --> 41:18.687
I heard the doctor
telling Mom that...

41:18.821 --> 41:21.490
my cancer is getting worse.

41:24.293 --> 41:29.031
He said...
I don't have much time.

41:34.370 --> 41:37.139
Am I going to die?

41:37.273 --> 41:41.811
When did you hear this?

41:41.944 --> 41:43.946
At the hospital today.

41:44.080 --> 41:46.816
We don't have to talk about it
if it upsets you.

41:46.949 --> 41:49.585
We can talk about it.

41:53.055 --> 41:57.393
I'm just not sure what will
happen to me when I die.

42:01.330 --> 42:03.899
Jesus said...

42:04.033 --> 42:06.735
"I am the resurrection
and the life.

42:06.869 --> 42:11.907
"He who believes in Me... will
live, even though he dies...

42:12.041 --> 42:16.979
and whoever lives and believes
in Me... will never die."

42:17.113 --> 42:19.682
Will my soul go to Heaven...

42:19.815 --> 42:23.552
even if I'm really scared
of dying?

42:33.562 --> 42:35.297
Everyone's afraid to die.

42:37.066 --> 42:41.605
Even the bravest people.

42:43.105 --> 42:45.141
Was Jesus afraid?

42:45.274 --> 42:46.342
He was.

42:49.478 --> 42:53.516
But He was comforted by knowing
that He would live again.

42:53.649 --> 42:57.153
And you should feel
the same way too.

43:00.456 --> 43:02.525
<i>So stay tuned
as we keep you up to date</i>

43:02.658 --> 43:04.994
<i>on the miracles
of Sara Hopkins.</i>

43:05.127 --> 43:06.762
<i>And now,
back to Frank McDonald.</i>

43:06.896 --> 43:07.897
<i>Thanks, Dolores.</i>

43:08.030 --> 43:08.998
<i>Coming up next after the...</i>

43:10.600 --> 43:14.003
Is this possible?

43:14.136 --> 43:16.205
Could the little Hopkins girl
really be curing people?

43:16.338 --> 43:19.909
Anything is possible
if it's the will of God, but...

43:20.042 --> 43:22.478
But what, Alonzo?

43:22.612 --> 43:24.547
- She doesn't have much time.
- I know.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.850
But it's easy
to get your hopes up,

43:27.983 --> 43:29.552
and then if Theresa
isn't healed...?

43:29.685 --> 43:32.988
We have to try.

43:33.122 --> 43:36.058
We have to take Theresa
to see Sara Hopkins.

43:42.331 --> 43:44.767
She's here!
Sara's in there.

43:44.900 --> 43:47.002
She's gonna help us.
She's gonna heal us.

43:52.875 --> 43:55.144
Dad?

43:55.277 --> 43:56.845
I think these people
want to see Sara.

44:00.883 --> 44:03.319
Oh, Lord.

44:03.452 --> 44:05.354
I'll... go out
and ask 'em all to leave.

44:05.487 --> 44:07.089
You can't, Daddy.

44:07.223 --> 44:09.558
What if I was sick
and there was a possibility

44:09.693 --> 44:12.629
you could do something
to help me?

44:12.761 --> 44:14.930
But, Sara, didn't you say that
it wasn't you that healed Mark,

44:15.064 --> 44:16.765
that it was his faith in God?

44:16.899 --> 44:19.468
What if all those children
don't have that same faith?

44:19.603 --> 44:21.904
What if they do?

44:22.037 --> 44:23.539
Listen, sweetheart.

44:23.673 --> 44:27.042
You're just a little girl.

44:27.176 --> 44:29.411
And if you go out there and all
those people are healed,

44:29.545 --> 44:32.214
I'm afraid that...

44:32.348 --> 44:33.515
I'm afraid that
you're not gonna get a chance

44:33.650 --> 44:35.851
to be that little girl again.

44:35.985 --> 44:37.253
Do you understand?

44:38.520 --> 44:40.089
Daddy's right.

44:40.222 --> 44:41.757
They're gonna keep coming
more and more.

44:41.890 --> 44:43.993
It'll never stop.

44:44.126 --> 44:45.828
Look, you haven't even had
breakfast yet.

44:45.961 --> 44:47.263
Let's go in the kitchen,

44:47.396 --> 44:48.632
I'll make you some waffles

44:48.764 --> 44:50.299
and we can talk about it
some more, okay?

44:50.432 --> 44:51.500
All right, come on.

44:52.736 --> 44:54.671
Come on, sweetheart.

45:08.250 --> 45:09.418
Sara?

45:09.551 --> 45:11.655
Sara?

45:14.390 --> 45:16.091
Look, folks, um...

45:16.225 --> 45:19.528
we know what you've heard
about our daughter...

45:19.663 --> 45:20.863
but it's just gossip.

45:20.996 --> 45:22.632
It's stories
made up by the media.

45:22.766 --> 45:25.769
Our little girl...

45:25.901 --> 45:27.569
she can't cure sick people,

45:27.704 --> 45:30.239
and I'm sorry that you
came out here, but...

45:30.372 --> 45:33.342
please, go back home.

45:33.475 --> 45:35.844
She's just a little girl.

45:35.978 --> 45:39.181
She can't help us.

45:39.315 --> 45:40.816
Wait, wait.

45:52.961 --> 45:56.098
You're the girl from my drawing.

45:56.231 --> 45:57.866
Drawing?

45:58.000 --> 46:00.869
You like horses, right?

46:05.074 --> 46:06.141
Listen.

46:06.275 --> 46:08.977
I did see God.

46:09.111 --> 46:11.715
I don't know if I can help you,
but I did see Him.

46:33.202 --> 46:34.738
Thank you.

46:38.941 --> 46:41.076
Mom, I'm gonna be okay.

46:53.389 --> 46:55.891
Thank you.

47:44.373 --> 47:47.109
You have sandy hair!

47:47.242 --> 47:48.812
You can see?

47:48.944 --> 47:50.279
Look at me, Isabel.

47:50.412 --> 47:52.147
Hi, Mommy.

48:13.135 --> 48:15.672
- Oh, my God.
- What is happening?

48:26.448 --> 48:28.050
Thank you for coming.

48:28.183 --> 48:31.821
Um... I have to go see
my parents now.

48:31.955 --> 48:33.322
Move very carefully.

48:33.455 --> 48:34.323
Are you okay?

48:34.456 --> 48:35.692
Sara?

48:35.825 --> 48:37.359
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Come on, baby.

48:37.493 --> 48:39.261
Come on.

48:45.234 --> 48:48.103
All right, look, uh,
we've done all the blood work,

48:48.237 --> 48:50.138
and I've, uh,
called the hospital

48:50.272 --> 48:52.474
and scheduled her for an M.R.I.,

48:52.609 --> 48:55.077
so, uh,
they'll be waiting for you.

48:55.210 --> 48:57.714
Doctor, after she prayed
for Mark Miller...

48:57.847 --> 48:59.983
she couldn't get out of bed
all day.

49:00.115 --> 49:02.150
And, and now look at her.

49:02.284 --> 49:03.753
I mean, she's so exhausted.

49:03.887 --> 49:06.823
She's, like, wrung out.

49:06.956 --> 49:11.293
You know...
you weren't there, but...

49:11.426 --> 49:12.962
something really did happen.

49:13.095 --> 49:17.466
A-Another boy in a wheelchair
stood up and walked.

49:17.600 --> 49:19.969
A, a blind girl could see again.

49:20.102 --> 49:22.070
What's going on? How could
any of this be happening?

49:23.572 --> 49:25.274
Let's, um... let's find out

49:25.407 --> 49:27.109
what's wrong
with your daughter first.

49:27.242 --> 49:30.546
Then we can... figure out what
happened in your front yard.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.114
Yes?

49:32.247 --> 49:33.850
Doctor,
I think there's something

49:33.983 --> 49:36.619
you and the Hopkins need to see.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.421
<i>...find out.</i>

49:39.555 --> 49:41.156
<i>Just hours ago,
standing right here,</i>

49:41.290 --> 49:43.559
<i>miracles were
supposedly performed.</i>

49:43.693 --> 49:45.695
<i>It's been said
that a blind girl can now see,</i>

49:45.828 --> 49:47.664
<i>a paralyzed boy can walk,</i>

49:47.797 --> 49:50.566
<i>and a little girl with cancer
says she was healed.</i>

49:50.700 --> 49:52.568
<i>But are these miracles real?</i>

49:52.702 --> 49:55.437
<i>Is Sara Hopkins
a miracle worker?</i>

49:55.571 --> 49:59.541
<i>We'll stick with this story
until we get the answers.</i>

50:03.211 --> 50:05.113
Oh, no.

50:09.052 --> 50:10.519
How'd they know we were here?

50:10.653 --> 50:13.121
She's all over the Internet too.

50:13.255 --> 50:15.024
We need to get Sara
out of here.

50:15.157 --> 50:17.060
Take her to the hospital
and get those tests done.

50:17.192 --> 50:19.194
You think you could stay at your
father's for a couple of days?

50:19.328 --> 50:20.797
Yeah, sure.

50:20.930 --> 50:22.297
But, you know, the press
probably followed us here

50:22.431 --> 50:23.432
'cause they know our car.

50:23.565 --> 50:24.968
Hey, well, I'm parked out back.

50:25.100 --> 50:26.234
They wouldn't recognize mine.

50:26.368 --> 50:27.837
Okay, great, um...

50:27.971 --> 50:29.772
Honey, why don't you and Ben
go gather up Sara?

50:29.906 --> 50:32.008
Danny, meet me around back,
we'll take her in your car,

50:32.140 --> 50:33.676
and let's just hope
they don't recognize us

50:33.810 --> 50:34.911
sneaking her out of here.

50:35.044 --> 50:36.411
Oh, no worries, I'll stall 'em.

50:36.545 --> 50:37.814
You think you can
handle the press?

50:37.947 --> 50:39.048
Sure.

50:41.751 --> 50:44.152
We can handle this, Dad.

50:48.891 --> 50:50.927
Hi, Mrs. Hopkins.
I'm gonna go home.

50:51.060 --> 50:52.327
Thank you for dinner.

50:52.461 --> 50:54.329
Bye, honey.
Thank you for helping out.

50:54.463 --> 50:55.330
See you, Sam.

50:55.464 --> 50:56.699
Bye, Cindy.

51:02.170 --> 51:04.473
Well...

51:04.607 --> 51:06.508
you look tired.

51:06.643 --> 51:11.146
I'm exhausted.

51:11.279 --> 51:15.084
I can't even begin
to describe or understand

51:15.217 --> 51:18.121
what happened with Sara
this morning at our house.

51:18.253 --> 51:20.990
I don't know what to say.

51:21.124 --> 51:22.759
I mean...

51:22.892 --> 51:24.426
I know something happened,

51:24.559 --> 51:28.698
but nothing like this
has ever happened in our family.

51:28.831 --> 51:30.565
It's about to turn her world
upside down,

51:30.700 --> 51:34.469
and I don't think... anybody in
this family, least of all her,

51:34.604 --> 51:36.806
is prepared for that.

51:36.939 --> 51:39.642
But, Dad, I'm worried, because
ever since she said she saw God,

51:39.776 --> 51:41.077
she just keeps getting sicker.

51:41.209 --> 51:42.679
I have never seen her this ill.

51:42.812 --> 51:44.847
I'm really worried that this is
something very serious.

51:50.252 --> 51:53.355
- Oh, it's the doctor.
- Okay.

51:53.488 --> 51:54.991
Hello?

51:55.124 --> 51:57.894
Hi, Ben.

51:58.027 --> 52:00.163
And what, what did they say?

52:02.832 --> 52:04.834
What?

52:11.540 --> 52:14.242
Yes?

52:14.376 --> 52:15.678
What?

52:15.812 --> 52:18.181
Oh, my gosh.

52:18.313 --> 52:20.549
Thank you.

52:49.045 --> 52:52.447
I know You can hear me.

52:53.750 --> 52:57.086
You heard me in 'Nam.

52:57.220 --> 53:00.455
You could have probably heard me
down to the house too, but...

53:00.590 --> 53:04.060
I thought maybe...
this place'd have some...

53:04.193 --> 53:06.629
special meaning to You, so...

53:06.763 --> 53:08.965
I came here to say my piece.

53:10.499 --> 53:15.270
I know I got no right...
to ask You to hear me...

53:15.403 --> 53:17.874
or to... show Yourself, or...

53:19.274 --> 53:22.779
I know who I am.

53:22.912 --> 53:24.914
I know what I've done.

53:26.448 --> 53:30.820
I drank too much,
I fought all the time.

53:32.054 --> 53:37.760
In the army... I did things.

53:37.894 --> 53:40.830
But, still, I got married.

53:40.963 --> 53:42.999
I was a good husband.

53:43.132 --> 53:46.501
I worked every day, I pounded
sheet metal for 40 years,

53:46.636 --> 53:49.471
and I had a beautiful daughter.

53:49.605 --> 53:52.742
And my wife took her to church
all the time.

53:52.875 --> 53:57.345
Now... I just don't know
exactly where Sara was

53:57.479 --> 54:00.448
when she saw You...

54:00.583 --> 54:03.886
but I want You to know I would
be in that spot if I could.

54:04.020 --> 54:08.323
Lord... oh...

54:08.456 --> 54:11.459
she's such a beautiful child.

54:11.594 --> 54:16.199
She is... she is so much better
than I ever was,

54:16.331 --> 54:19.434
and You know
she always loved You.

54:19.568 --> 54:22.271
From the time she could talk,
she would ask me,

54:22.404 --> 54:24.941
"Does He cut
His fingernails, Grampa?

54:25.074 --> 54:27.542
Does He shave like you do?"

54:27.677 --> 54:29.377
What was I to say?

54:29.511 --> 54:36.518
I... I said, "Honey... He gave
you life, He must love you."

54:40.122 --> 54:42.557
I don't understand!

54:42.692 --> 54:45.527
I just, I just don't understand

54:45.661 --> 54:47.864
why You would make her
so perfect

54:47.997 --> 54:50.666
and then
snatch her away from us!

54:50.800 --> 54:53.336
I do not understand it!

54:54.871 --> 54:58.573
God... I am asking You...

54:58.708 --> 55:03.045
No... I'm begging You.

55:03.179 --> 55:05.248
Please don't do this.

55:05.380 --> 55:09.252
Please don't do this,
don't take Sara!

55:09.384 --> 55:12.121
If You need somebody, take me.

55:12.255 --> 55:16.225
Stop my heart right here,
it's okay.

55:16.359 --> 55:19.729
But please don't take Sara.

55:25.500 --> 55:28.570
Oh, God...

55:31.841 --> 55:35.077
- Morning.
- Morning.

55:35.211 --> 55:37.412
- Come in.
- Thank you.

55:44.086 --> 55:47.590
- Uh, is Sara here?
- Yes.

55:47.723 --> 55:50.425
Uh, you know, I think it'll be
better if we talk in private.

55:50.558 --> 55:52.762
Of course.
I'll go get Alex.

55:56.832 --> 55:58.968
"...and deeper and deeper
into the wild Tinker went..."

55:59.101 --> 56:00.970
Hey, Danny?

56:01.103 --> 56:03.072
Can you please take Sara outside
for a little bit?

56:03.205 --> 56:05.107
I think
she could use some fresh air.

56:05.241 --> 56:07.610
Uh, yeah, we can do that.

56:07.743 --> 56:09.477
Um... can we go to the lake?

56:09.612 --> 56:11.614
No, no, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

56:11.747 --> 56:13.416
Please, Mom.

56:13.548 --> 56:16.185
Honey, I'll take you someplace
after, someplace really fun.

56:16.319 --> 56:18.654
- Okay?
- Okay.

56:18.788 --> 56:19.855
Come on, let's go.

56:24.360 --> 56:25.962
Ah, okay.

56:26.095 --> 56:29.932
Let's see...

56:30.066 --> 56:35.738
ah... if you can take me...
at this... right here.

56:35.871 --> 56:37.306
Ah.

56:37.440 --> 56:39.442
Okay.

56:39.574 --> 56:42.144
You ready?

56:42.278 --> 56:44.479
You take one of these,
and then...

56:46.349 --> 56:48.684
Nice...!

56:48.818 --> 56:52.188
Okay, um... your turn.

56:52.321 --> 56:53.789
You hold that.

56:53.923 --> 56:56.158
And we're gonna
scoot up for you.

56:56.292 --> 56:59.862
Okay, just look at the can...
and throw it.

57:15.778 --> 57:18.347
Is there anything else
you want to do?

57:18.481 --> 57:22.084
I know the doctor's here
to talk about me, so...

57:22.218 --> 57:24.519
I just wish I knew
what he was saying.

57:24.653 --> 57:28.024
Well... why don't we keep
playing the game?

57:28.157 --> 57:30.893
I'll tell you what...
for every can you knock down,

57:31.027 --> 57:33.362
you get a free hour on my phone.

57:33.496 --> 57:35.164
Deal?

57:35.297 --> 57:39.468
Will you just set up a lot more
cans so I have more of a chance?

57:39.602 --> 57:41.103
Sure.

57:42.171 --> 57:44.440
All right, so...

57:44.572 --> 57:45.708
here's a few more.

57:45.841 --> 57:47.843
These are bigger targets, uh,

57:47.977 --> 57:49.178
and you can shoot
from a closer spot too.

57:49.311 --> 57:50.946
I think that'll help, Sara.

57:52.982 --> 57:54.850
Sara?

57:56.519 --> 58:00.555
So you feel that
these tests are comprehensive?

58:00.689 --> 58:02.058
Dr. O'Connor's
been reviewing the scans

58:02.191 --> 58:03.558
of Sara's brain.

58:03.692 --> 58:06.062
He sent them out
for three other opinions,

58:06.195 --> 58:07.596
and they all feel that,

58:07.730 --> 58:10.733
because of the size and location
of the tumor,

58:10.866 --> 58:13.202
that surgery
would just be too risky.

58:13.335 --> 58:16.238
Too risky... and...?

58:16.372 --> 58:19.909
And he's saying that...

58:20.042 --> 58:24.046
Sara's brain tumor
is inoperable.

58:24.180 --> 58:27.249
Yes, that's, that's,
that's what it means.

58:27.383 --> 58:30.619
And he also believes that
the tumor could be causing...

58:30.753 --> 58:32.388
the hallucinations.

58:32.521 --> 58:36.225
That's why she thinks she sees
God when no one else does.

58:36.358 --> 58:38.894
But what about
the children that she cured?

58:39.028 --> 58:42.898
Power of suggestion,
you know, a placebo effect.

58:43.032 --> 58:45.334
What are you saying,
that this is the result of,

58:45.468 --> 58:47.636
of a kind of mass hypnosis?

58:47.770 --> 58:50.139
A handicapped child
walked again,

58:50.272 --> 58:52.308
a blind girl
regained her eyesight,

58:52.441 --> 58:55.811
and another little girl is sure
that Sara cured her cancer,

58:55.945 --> 58:57.313
for crying out loud.

58:57.446 --> 58:58.714
Jerry, there are
documented cases

58:58.848 --> 59:00.216
that explain
these types of healings.

59:00.349 --> 59:02.218
I mean, in, in 2004,
there was a man

59:02.351 --> 59:05.254
who had tumors the size of
grapefruits throughout his body,

59:05.387 --> 59:07.156
and he had
less than two weeks to live.

59:07.289 --> 59:10.159
He took a substance that he
believed would cure cancer,

59:10.292 --> 59:12.628
and four days later, the tumors
completely disappeared.

59:12.761 --> 59:14.964
So it's in the realm
of possibility

59:15.097 --> 59:18.400
that this is
what happened to those children.

59:18.534 --> 59:22.138
Okay, okay, we can talk about
those other children later.

59:22.271 --> 59:24.807
What other options do we have?

59:26.142 --> 59:27.543
There are
no other options, Bonnie.

59:27.676 --> 59:28.944
I'm sorry.

59:32.248 --> 59:35.351
No... other options?

59:35.484 --> 59:38.988
Wait, are... are you saying...

59:39.121 --> 59:42.925
Sara has more faith
than any child I've ever met.

59:43.058 --> 59:45.694
I don't think anyone
can say for certain

59:45.828 --> 59:48.564
when she is going to die.

59:50.099 --> 59:55.037
Are you saying...
my little girl's gonna die?

59:57.306 --> 1:00:00.543
Ben, just tell us the truth.

1:00:00.676 --> 1:00:02.678
Sara's dying.

1:00:07.316 --> 1:00:10.786
Wait, there, there, there must
be, like, a special hospital

1:00:10.920 --> 1:00:14.723
or, or some, some new,
experimental treatments.

1:00:14.857 --> 1:00:16.425
Something that we can do.

1:00:16.559 --> 1:00:20.396
If there was... anything I
could do, Bonnie, believe me...

1:00:20.529 --> 1:00:22.331
I would.

1:00:22.464 --> 1:00:26.936
So, we have to...
we have to tell her.

1:00:27.069 --> 1:00:30.239
How do I tell my little girl
that she's gonna die?

1:00:30.372 --> 1:00:31.740
I don't want to lose her, honey.

1:00:31.874 --> 1:00:33.075
I can't stand it.

1:00:33.209 --> 1:00:34.577
I love her too much.

1:00:34.710 --> 1:00:36.979
She's my baby...

1:00:37.112 --> 1:00:39.315
I can't...

1:00:39.448 --> 1:00:42.017
It's okay, Mommy.

1:00:42.151 --> 1:00:43.519
Oh, Sara.

1:00:43.653 --> 1:00:45.689
I just don't want you to cry.

1:00:45.821 --> 1:00:47.556
Stop crying.

1:00:47.691 --> 1:00:50.192
Oh, honey... I'm so sorry you
had to hear all of that too.

1:00:50.326 --> 1:00:52.261
Please, stop crying.

1:00:52.394 --> 1:00:54.930
Really, it's okay.

1:00:55.064 --> 1:00:57.533
I heard what Dr. Riley said
about me dying.

1:00:57.667 --> 1:00:59.535
- Oh...
- Just, I don't want you

1:00:59.669 --> 1:01:02.238
to be sad, okay?

1:01:02.371 --> 1:01:05.241
It's okay, 'cause if I go
to Heaven, I'll be with God.

1:01:10.212 --> 1:01:12.348
Sweetheart...

1:01:12.481 --> 1:01:14.216
I love you.

1:01:14.350 --> 1:01:16.018
I love you this much!

1:01:16.151 --> 1:01:20.489
I love you this much
and even more.

1:01:22.391 --> 1:01:25.928
Mom, Dad, I don't want to go
to the hospital.

1:01:26.061 --> 1:01:29.298
I want to go back to the lake...

1:01:29.431 --> 1:01:31.934
and I want to see God again.
Please?

1:01:32.067 --> 1:01:36.038
I... oh... but...

1:01:36.171 --> 1:01:38.040
We have to go
to the hospital, okay?

1:01:38.173 --> 1:01:39.808
That's where
they'll make you comfortable.

1:01:39.942 --> 1:01:42.712
I know, but I want to go
back to the lake.

1:01:42.845 --> 1:01:45.781
I want to ask God
if I can wait to go to Heaven

1:01:45.914 --> 1:01:48.752
and stay with you guys
till I grow up.

1:01:50.919 --> 1:01:52.154
Honey? Honey? Oh, no.

1:01:52.288 --> 1:01:53.989
- Look at me.
- Oh, no, oh, no.

1:01:54.123 --> 1:01:57.326
We need to get her
to the hospital, right now.

1:02:02.097 --> 1:02:05.501
Grampa, please take me
to the lake.

1:02:15.311 --> 1:02:16.979
Oh, my God, is she here?

1:02:19.415 --> 1:02:20.549
Do you have everything we need?

1:02:20.684 --> 1:02:22.217
Relax, I got everything
taken care of.

1:02:22.351 --> 1:02:24.153
- All right, all right.
- Hey, hey, here they come!

1:02:26.088 --> 1:02:28.658
Danny, can you tell us the
status of your sister's health?

1:02:28.792 --> 1:02:31.293
Is this
some sort of grave illness?

1:02:31.427 --> 1:02:32.895
How, how's she doing?

1:02:33.028 --> 1:02:34.798
How's your mom?
Cindy! Cindy!

1:02:34.930 --> 1:02:37.132
Give us an update of some kind.

1:02:41.904 --> 1:02:44.506
Hey...

1:02:44.641 --> 1:02:47.176
I thought...
you might want to draw me

1:02:47.309 --> 1:02:49.813
one of those Rembrandts
you've been coming up with.

1:02:49.945 --> 1:02:51.213
Thanks, you guys.

1:02:51.347 --> 1:02:53.750
Danny?

1:02:53.882 --> 1:02:57.186
I wanted to know what it's like
to date someone...

1:02:57.319 --> 1:02:59.521
and... to be in love.

1:02:59.656 --> 1:03:01.523
The way you and Cindy are.

1:03:03.892 --> 1:03:08.230
Well... um...

1:03:08.364 --> 1:03:10.966
it's great.

1:03:11.100 --> 1:03:15.839
You always look forward
to being with one another.

1:03:15.971 --> 1:03:17.674
You share stuff.

1:03:17.807 --> 1:03:20.744
I mean, feelings and things.

1:03:20.876 --> 1:03:23.912
It's tough to explain it.

1:03:24.046 --> 1:03:27.015
When you start dating,
you'll find out.

1:03:27.149 --> 1:03:30.252
I don't think I'm gonna
live that long, Danny,

1:03:30.386 --> 1:03:35.924
and... I think it's something
I'm really gonna miss.

1:03:44.333 --> 1:03:48.437
Is there anything
we can do for you?

1:03:48.570 --> 1:03:52.007
You can sing the
"Believe in You" song for me...

1:03:52.141 --> 1:03:55.377
like we did in the car.

1:03:57.379 --> 1:04:01.150
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1:04:01.283 --> 1:04:04.052
♪ So give me a sign ♪

1:04:04.186 --> 1:04:08.090
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:10.627
♪ Just give me more time... ♪

1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:13.763
♪ I wanna believe in You ♪

1:04:13.897 --> 1:04:19.368
♪ But You have to believe...
in me. ♪

1:04:26.041 --> 1:04:28.912
How's my beautiful angel?

1:04:29.044 --> 1:04:31.146
Hey, sweetheart.

1:04:41.356 --> 1:04:44.594
Uh... we're gonna step out
for a while, but...

1:04:44.727 --> 1:04:47.296
we'll be right back.

1:04:53.803 --> 1:04:55.137
We love you so much.

1:05:14.223 --> 1:05:15.792
Wipe your feet.

1:05:19.228 --> 1:05:21.263
Now take a seat.

1:05:21.396 --> 1:05:24.767
Thank you all for coming.

1:05:24.901 --> 1:05:27.637
Theresa has something to say.

1:05:32.675 --> 1:05:35.845
Last week,
when Sara was helping

1:05:35.979 --> 1:05:37.881
those children
outside her house...

1:05:38.013 --> 1:05:40.549
I felt something.

1:05:40.683 --> 1:05:44.453
I also saw it.

1:05:44.587 --> 1:05:47.624
It was a spiritual figure
floating next to Sara,

1:05:47.757 --> 1:05:52.494
holding out His hand to touch
the children she was touching.

1:05:54.363 --> 1:05:57.332
After she prayed for me...

1:05:57.466 --> 1:06:01.270
I felt... different...

1:06:01.403 --> 1:06:06.943
and warm...
for the first time in two years.

1:06:07.075 --> 1:06:08.410
Healthy.

1:06:10.546 --> 1:06:13.583
I knew I'd been cured...

1:06:13.716 --> 1:06:18.220
and I also know
that I was seeing God.

1:06:18.353 --> 1:06:21.691
Everything Sara told us
was true.

1:06:21.824 --> 1:06:24.894
She wanted so much
to help people and...

1:06:25.028 --> 1:06:27.864
and now we have to help her.

1:06:31.567 --> 1:06:33.068
Thank you, Theresa.

1:06:35.170 --> 1:06:39.107
All right, Mac and I
have worked out a plan...

1:06:39.241 --> 1:06:42.477
and it's liable to get
a whole bunch of people upset.

1:06:42.612 --> 1:06:44.079
And by a whole bunch of people,

1:06:44.212 --> 1:06:48.017
I mean Dr. Riley,
I mean your parents,

1:06:48.150 --> 1:06:51.253
and I mean about everybody
at the hospital.

1:06:51.386 --> 1:06:53.790
The last thing
Sara said to me was

1:06:53.923 --> 1:06:56.926
she wanted to go
back to the lake.

1:06:57.060 --> 1:06:58.962
I know that
that's where she had her vision,

1:06:59.094 --> 1:07:01.163
I know that's where
her healing comes from.

1:07:01.296 --> 1:07:05.200
I have to think that she knows
something that we don't know,

1:07:05.334 --> 1:07:06.903
something that could help her.

1:07:07.036 --> 1:07:10.405
I don't know, but I do know

1:07:10.539 --> 1:07:12.775
I'm gonna see
that she gets her last wish.

1:07:12.909 --> 1:07:16.311
I'm taking Sara
back to the lake tonight.

1:07:16.445 --> 1:07:18.413
Oh, we're in.

1:07:18.547 --> 1:07:20.950
She helped to cure my baby.

1:07:21.084 --> 1:07:23.218
We're gonna do
everything we can to help her.

1:07:23.352 --> 1:07:24.787
I can't explain the miracles

1:07:24.921 --> 1:07:27.090
that have taken place
through Sara,

1:07:27.222 --> 1:07:29.124
but if she wants
to go back up there,

1:07:29.257 --> 1:07:32.127
I believe it is God's will
for us to help her.

1:07:32.260 --> 1:07:33.696
I agree with you, Pastor.

1:07:33.830 --> 1:07:36.699
Sounds good to me, I'm in.

1:07:36.833 --> 1:07:39.836
But there's reporters and people

1:07:39.969 --> 1:07:41.536
all around
the outside of the hospital.

1:07:41.671 --> 1:07:44.439
And inside, she's surrounded
by not only my parents,

1:07:44.573 --> 1:07:46.609
but the entire hospital staff.

1:07:46.743 --> 1:07:49.177
They're not gonna let us
take her out of there.

1:07:49.311 --> 1:07:51.146
We need a major plan
to spring her.

1:07:51.279 --> 1:07:53.415
Exactly.

1:07:53.548 --> 1:07:54.817
Maria's been working part-time

1:07:54.951 --> 1:07:57.854
as a night nurse
up at the hospital.

1:07:57.987 --> 1:08:02.257
She has this pass,
which'll open almost any door.

1:08:06.161 --> 1:08:09.032
So this is what I'm thinking...

1:08:41.898 --> 1:08:44.734
It's okay, honey.

1:08:44.867 --> 1:08:47.937
We're here, we're all here.

1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.080
Hey, kids, can I talk to you
in the waiting room a minute?

1:08:57.212 --> 1:09:00.248
Why not in here?

1:09:00.382 --> 1:09:04.120
It's okay,
I need some more coffee anyway.

1:09:11.994 --> 1:09:13.996
The room's clear.

1:09:15.998 --> 1:09:17.734
<i>Dr. Kravitz,</i>

1:09:17.867 --> 1:09:19.902
<i>you have a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

1:09:23.538 --> 1:09:26.709
Hey... we're gonna get you
outta here...

1:09:31.413 --> 1:09:33.916
Okay, we have to get this done
very carefully.

1:09:34.050 --> 1:09:35.585
Any break in the pulse rhythm

1:09:35.718 --> 1:09:36.953
will bring the whole
nursing staff right in here.

1:09:37.086 --> 1:09:41.456
One, two, three...

1:09:44.761 --> 1:09:45.995
Okay.

1:10:14.791 --> 1:10:17.425
Excuse me, but my,
my friend here isn't...

1:10:17.559 --> 1:10:19.327
feel-feeling very well.

1:10:19.461 --> 1:10:20.963
What are your symptoms?

1:10:21.097 --> 1:10:23.232
I don't know, I, I just,
I feel so dizzy and...

1:10:23.365 --> 1:10:24.432
I think I'm gonna faint.

1:10:24.566 --> 1:10:26.002
- Well, let's get you...
- Oh...

1:10:26.135 --> 1:10:27.804
Lay down.

1:10:33.810 --> 1:10:37.747
<i>Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.</i>

1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:39.682
<i>Dr. Kravitz...</i>

1:10:39.816 --> 1:10:41.717
<i>...a visitor in the main lobby.</i>

1:10:41.851 --> 1:10:43.853
Where are we going?

1:10:43.986 --> 1:10:46.222
Taking you to the lake.

1:11:10.279 --> 1:11:11.314
We're good!

1:11:12.648 --> 1:11:14.884
All better now, thanks!

1:11:15.952 --> 1:11:18.654
Hey, you forgot your bag!

1:11:19.789 --> 1:11:21.858
Thank you!

1:11:23.491 --> 1:11:25.328
Look, Sam, we can't do
something like that.

1:11:25.460 --> 1:11:27.462
You heard what the doctor said.

1:11:27.597 --> 1:11:29.564
I know you both disagree,

1:11:29.699 --> 1:11:31.667
but I'm gonna honor
that last request.

1:11:31.801 --> 1:11:33.435
Dad, no!

1:11:33.568 --> 1:11:35.238
I know how much you love her,
but we are not taking her

1:11:35.370 --> 1:11:37.707
back to that lake...

1:11:37.840 --> 1:11:40.643
...especially
on a night like this.

1:11:51.519 --> 1:11:53.388
How's she looking?

1:11:53.521 --> 1:11:54.891
Looks like she's sleeping again.

1:11:55.024 --> 1:11:58.361
Honey? Sweeth...

1:11:58.493 --> 1:12:00.363
What the... what is this?

1:12:00.495 --> 1:12:01.764
Where's Sara?

1:12:01.898 --> 1:12:02.965
Um...

1:12:03.099 --> 1:12:05.668
Dad! Dad?

1:12:05.801 --> 1:12:06.869
Oh, my...

1:12:07.003 --> 1:12:08.070
What is going on?

1:12:08.204 --> 1:12:09.605
- Um... well...
- Where's Sara?

1:12:09.739 --> 1:12:11.207
We thought that she wasn't
comfortable here,

1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:12.775
so we decided
to take her down...

1:12:12.909 --> 1:12:14.243
To the lake?!

1:12:14.377 --> 1:12:16.245
Kinda...

1:12:16.379 --> 1:12:19.547
Did you see Sara Hopkins
leaving Room 12?

1:12:19.682 --> 1:12:20.716
She couldn't have.

1:12:20.850 --> 1:12:22.218
Her pulse monitor is still on.

1:12:22.351 --> 1:12:24.353
You might want to check again.

1:12:24.486 --> 1:12:26.122
You really think
they're going to the lake?

1:12:26.255 --> 1:12:27.857
Yeah, this is all Dad's doing.

1:12:27.990 --> 1:12:29.959
Him and that stupid, crazy idea
of taking her back there!

1:12:35.031 --> 1:12:39.101
Go! Go! I'll follow ya!

1:13:03.893 --> 1:13:06.095
I don't think I can take
this much excitement!

1:13:06.228 --> 1:13:07.630
Yeah?
Hold on to your hat,

1:13:07.763 --> 1:13:10.199
'cause there's gonna be
a lot more of it!

1:13:17.539 --> 1:13:22.445
Hey! The Hopkins girl just left,
headed up I-60!

1:13:22.577 --> 1:13:24.413
- I-60?
- Yes!

1:13:24.546 --> 1:13:25.948
- All right, let's go, let's go!
- Let's go!

1:13:36.726 --> 1:13:38.694
Can you see okay?

1:13:40.229 --> 1:13:41.330
It'll be all right, honey.

1:13:41.464 --> 1:13:43.699
We'll be there soon.

1:14:00.816 --> 1:14:04.086
Oh, man, if we stop, we're sunk.

1:14:04.220 --> 1:14:06.822
But, Danny, you have to stop,
it's the police!

1:14:13.863 --> 1:14:16.098
Okay, we're gonna have to
cut these guys off, Mac.

1:14:16.232 --> 1:14:18.566
Oh, Lord, forgive him, for he
knows not what he's doing!

1:14:18.701 --> 1:14:19.969
Hold on!

1:14:23.873 --> 1:14:25.041
Car! Car!

1:14:28.344 --> 1:14:29.912
Oh... oh...

1:14:32.314 --> 1:14:33.716
Isn't that Sam Donovan's truck?

1:14:33.849 --> 1:14:35.718
Sure looks like it...

1:14:35.851 --> 1:14:38.487
This is not gonna sit real well
with the cops.

1:14:38.621 --> 1:14:40.156
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1:14:40.289 --> 1:14:41.891
Aren't you going about as fast
as this truck can go?

1:14:42.024 --> 1:14:44.760
It's not about going fast,
it's about slowing down.

1:14:51.700 --> 1:14:53.602
What's the matter with that guy?
Has he gone nuts?

1:14:53.736 --> 1:14:55.604
Oh, Lord,
I hope they don't hit us.

1:14:55.738 --> 1:14:57.039
What?!

1:14:57.173 --> 1:14:58.707
Sam Donovan, pull over!

1:14:58.841 --> 1:15:00.575
<i>You're obstructing justice</i>

1:15:00.709 --> 1:15:02.044
and interfering
with a police pursuit!

1:15:06.082 --> 1:15:07.716
We're losing them!

1:15:07.850 --> 1:15:08.951
Danny, be careful!

1:15:09.085 --> 1:15:11.387
The road is so wet, slow down!

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.489
Don't worry, I got this.

1:15:15.624 --> 1:15:20.196
Oh, Heavenly Father, please
let them be lenient with us.

1:15:20.329 --> 1:15:22.465
How many years you think
we're gonna get for this?

1:15:22.598 --> 1:15:23.933
I don't know, Mac,

1:15:24.066 --> 1:15:26.402
but enough to brush up
on my Bible reading!

1:15:32.541 --> 1:15:34.376
- Who's this now?
- Beats me,

1:15:34.510 --> 1:15:37.279
but between the speeding,
illegal passing and tailgating,

1:15:37.413 --> 1:15:39.281
looks like we're gonna have to
run half the town in.

1:15:39.415 --> 1:15:40.716
I'm gonna call for backup.

1:15:42.785 --> 1:15:45.254
Is that Sam
up ahead of the police?

1:15:45.387 --> 1:15:46.956
Looks like it.

1:15:47.089 --> 1:15:48.757
Are you sure you should be
tailgating this close?

1:15:48.891 --> 1:15:50.226
I'm trying to see
what he's up to.

1:15:50.359 --> 1:15:52.995
We're going a lot slower
than when we started.

1:15:53.129 --> 1:15:54.797
That's because
he's helping Danny get away.

1:15:54.930 --> 1:15:57.099
Dude is awesome!

1:16:09.613 --> 1:16:10.614
No...

1:16:10.746 --> 1:16:12.348
No, this can't be happening!

1:16:12.481 --> 1:16:14.316
We have to get her up there!

1:16:14.450 --> 1:16:16.452
Here they come!

1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:20.289
Can you carry her up?

1:16:20.422 --> 1:16:23.325
Probably not in the storm,
not alone.

1:16:28.063 --> 1:16:29.532
What are you doing here, man?

1:16:29.665 --> 1:16:31.333
You're trying to get your sister
up to the lake, right?

1:16:31.467 --> 1:16:33.402
Yeah, but the road's blocked,

1:16:33.536 --> 1:16:35.204
and I don't know
how much time she has.

1:16:35.337 --> 1:16:37.006
Cops are right on our tail.

1:16:37.139 --> 1:16:39.175
We can take a shortcut through
Mason's Hill, it's quicker.

1:16:39.308 --> 1:16:41.477
The mountain?
We'll never make it!

1:16:41.611 --> 1:16:43.445
Come on, dude, we can do this!

1:16:47.783 --> 1:16:51.020
For saving my dog, I owe you...
big time.

1:16:51.153 --> 1:16:53.322
Come on, we gotta go,
we gotta get out of here.

1:16:53.455 --> 1:16:54.490
Go, go, go.

1:17:19.583 --> 1:17:21.585
Where's Sara?

1:17:21.717 --> 1:17:23.085
Alvie and Danny have her.

1:17:23.219 --> 1:17:24.420
They started up the hill!

1:17:24.553 --> 1:17:25.655
Let's go.

1:17:25.788 --> 1:17:28.490
Donovan!
Hold it right there!

1:17:28.625 --> 1:17:30.694
You're not going anywhere!

1:17:30.826 --> 1:17:33.162
You've broken just about
every traffic law there is,

1:17:33.295 --> 1:17:35.497
not to mention
hindering a police pursuit.

1:17:35.632 --> 1:17:37.166
You're under arrest.

1:17:37.299 --> 1:17:38.602
We're impounding your vehicle

1:17:38.734 --> 1:17:41.170
and escorting you
to the station.

1:17:41.303 --> 1:17:43.839
Listen,
my granddaughter is dying!

1:17:43.973 --> 1:17:45.874
You mean the kid that's been
curing all those people?

1:17:46.008 --> 1:17:48.277
Yes, and the last thing
she asked me

1:17:48.410 --> 1:17:51.847
was to take her up to the lake
before she passes,

1:17:51.981 --> 1:17:54.250
and the doctors say
it could be tonight.

1:17:54.383 --> 1:17:55.884
You know where I live,

1:17:56.018 --> 1:17:58.320
you can arrest me
on the way down,

1:17:58.454 --> 1:18:00.556
but I'm taking her up there now.

1:18:02.925 --> 1:18:07.429
Harrow, no sense
making things worse.

1:18:18.107 --> 1:18:22.845
It's not just Donovan,
the whole town's gone nuts!

1:18:39.461 --> 1:18:41.997
Oh! Ooh!

1:18:42.131 --> 1:18:43.966
No, no, no, no, don't come back,
don't come back!

1:18:44.099 --> 1:18:46.502
Keep going, Sam, keep going!

1:18:46.636 --> 1:18:48.003
Pastor Mac, are you okay?

1:18:48.137 --> 1:18:49.905
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1:19:58.507 --> 1:20:00.710
Good boy, Nobby!

1:20:10.185 --> 1:20:12.187
- You're gonna be okay.
- Lay her down here.

1:20:12.321 --> 1:20:14.556
Here, here, here, here.

1:20:14.691 --> 1:20:15.792
You're okay.

1:20:17.761 --> 1:20:20.562
Sara, we're here.

1:20:20.697 --> 1:20:23.132
Do you want me to pray with you?

1:20:23.265 --> 1:20:24.400
Our Father...

1:20:24.533 --> 1:20:26.034
who art in Heaven,

1:20:26.168 --> 1:20:29.538
hallowed be Thy name...

1:20:31.006 --> 1:20:32.842
Is she still with us?

1:20:32.975 --> 1:20:34.711
Barely.

1:20:45.921 --> 1:20:49.124
Sara! Sara? Sara?

1:20:49.258 --> 1:20:52.027
Hold on, Sara... oh, God...

1:20:52.161 --> 1:20:53.897
Hold on, sweetheart.

1:20:54.029 --> 1:20:55.564
Oh, no... no, no...

1:20:55.698 --> 1:21:00.536
Oh, baby, sweetheart...
I love you, I love you...

1:21:00.670 --> 1:21:01.805
I love you so much.

1:21:01.937 --> 1:21:04.006
Oh, sweetheart...

1:21:05.909 --> 1:21:07.242
Dad, you knew that the doctors

1:21:07.376 --> 1:21:08.812
wanted to keep her
in the hospital.

1:21:08.944 --> 1:21:10.179
How could you bring her here,

1:21:10.312 --> 1:21:12.514
especially on a night
like tonight?!

1:21:12.649 --> 1:21:14.584
If something happens,
it's your fault!

1:21:14.717 --> 1:21:17.821
This is your fault!
All of you!

1:21:17.953 --> 1:21:19.421
All of you had a hand in this!

1:21:19.555 --> 1:21:21.290
Why couldn't you just
leave her alone?

1:21:21.423 --> 1:21:23.492
She's such a good girl, all she
wanted to do was help you,

1:21:23.626 --> 1:21:25.628
and now she's...

1:21:25.762 --> 1:21:27.496
Oh, no... oh, no...

1:21:27.630 --> 1:21:29.465
Sara?
Sara, sweetheart?

1:21:29.599 --> 1:21:30.667
- Sweetheart?
- Come on, sweetheart.

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:33.168
No...

1:21:33.302 --> 1:21:35.337
Please, don't leave us.

1:23:20.242 --> 1:23:22.210
Oh... oh...

1:23:49.504 --> 1:23:52.274
Hey, did you get any of that?

1:23:54.911 --> 1:23:57.145
There's nothing there.

1:23:58.280 --> 1:24:00.883
It's blank.

1:24:09.792 --> 1:24:13.930
All right, Ed,
you can take me in.

1:24:14.063 --> 1:24:16.131
It's okay, Sam.

1:24:16.264 --> 1:24:18.635
Maybe you had
a good reason for speeding,

1:24:18.768 --> 1:24:20.937
even in the eyes of the law.

1:24:21.070 --> 1:24:24.306
Your granddaughter get to do
what she wanted?

1:24:24.439 --> 1:24:27.175
More than you'll ever know.

1:24:27.309 --> 1:24:28.711
Thank you.

1:24:31.948 --> 1:24:34.216
Eddie, are you seeing this?

1:24:34.349 --> 1:24:36.385
It was one of the strongest
storms of the year,

1:24:36.518 --> 1:24:39.454
yet none of the people
who went up there are wet.

1:25:45.621 --> 1:25:47.757
I'm so sorry.

1:25:49.558 --> 1:25:55.765
I know... nothing we can say
will bring you comfort...

1:25:55.898 --> 1:25:59.702
but we all know
where Sara is now.

1:25:59.836 --> 1:26:03.338
Safe in God's hands.

1:26:07.242 --> 1:26:10.213
Dad...

1:26:18.253 --> 1:26:20.823
Dad, I'm sorry
for what I said at the lake.

1:26:20.957 --> 1:26:22.290
I know how much you loved her,

1:26:22.424 --> 1:26:25.161
and you were just trying
to fulfil her wish.

1:26:25.293 --> 1:26:26.394
And, and you knew something

1:26:26.528 --> 1:26:28.097
that none of us
could understand,

1:26:28.231 --> 1:26:30.398
so I... thank you
for doing that for her.

1:26:38.107 --> 1:26:40.575
Dad.

1:26:55.258 --> 1:26:56.759
Must've been
the last picture she drew.

1:26:56.893 --> 1:27:00.562
I... I think she knew
God was coming for her.

1:27:00.696 --> 1:27:04.167
That's beautiful.

1:27:04.299 --> 1:27:07.435
I'll have it framed
and hung up in church.

1:27:11.573 --> 1:27:15.244
Danny...
Danny, look at this...

1:27:17.579 --> 1:27:20.149
Mom! Dad!

1:27:22.317 --> 1:27:24.720
<i>This</i> is
the last picture she drew.

1:27:24.854 --> 1:27:26.022
She's coming back!

1:27:26.155 --> 1:27:29.659
That means that, maybe...

1:27:32.460 --> 1:27:34.030
God...

1:27:34.163 --> 1:27:37.200
...are You gonna
let Sara come back to us?

1:27:37.332 --> 1:27:39.669
- Oh, Danny...
- Can You?

1:27:39.802 --> 1:27:41.737
- Will You, will You, please...
- Danny...

1:27:41.871 --> 1:27:43.572
Please, let Sara
come back to us?

1:27:43.706 --> 1:27:46.742
- Sweetheart, I'm sorry...
- Please, God.

1:27:46.876 --> 1:27:49.645
- Will You, please?
- You got to let her go.

1:27:49.779 --> 1:27:51.814
- Sara, please?
- I'm sorry, darling...

1:27:51.948 --> 1:27:53.783
- Please, Sara, please...
- I'm sorry...

1:27:53.916 --> 1:27:55.618
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1:27:58.921 --> 1:28:01.456
Sara? Sara!

1:28:01.591 --> 1:28:03.025
Oh, my...

1:28:03.159 --> 1:28:05.628
- Oh!
- Sara! Sara...

1:28:05.761 --> 1:28:07.864
Oh...

1:28:07.997 --> 1:28:10.333
- Sara?
- Hi, Mommy...

1:28:10.465 --> 1:28:11.968
Daddy...

1:28:13.102 --> 1:28:14.136
Sara!

1:28:14.270 --> 1:28:15.304
Honey, how are you?

1:28:19.474 --> 1:28:22.712
It's a miracle!

1:28:22.845 --> 1:28:27.016
I told God that I didn't think
I was ready to go to Heaven

1:28:27.149 --> 1:28:29.517
and He told me to come back here
and take care of you.

1:28:29.652 --> 1:28:34.290
Oh, my... my baby...

1:28:34.422 --> 1:28:37.425
Oh, my baby, you're alive.

1:28:37.559 --> 1:28:39.595
You're alive.

1:28:39.729 --> 1:28:40.963
I love you so much.

1:28:42.832 --> 1:28:47.502
Thank You, God, thank You, God.

1:28:47.637 --> 1:28:48.470
Thank You, God.

1:28:48.604 --> 1:28:50.339
It, it, it's not possible.

1:28:50.472 --> 1:28:54.343
She wasn't breathing, there was
no, there was no pulse.

1:28:54.476 --> 1:28:56.746
You're beginning to catch on.

1:29:10.159 --> 1:29:11.761
It's a miracle!

1:29:23.306 --> 1:29:26.943
No, don't kneel.

1:29:27.076 --> 1:29:31.948
I'm just a... lucky girl
who God decided to visit.

1:29:32.081 --> 1:29:35.985
It... could've been
any one of you.

1:29:36.118 --> 1:29:39.355
He still may come back
to see one of you,

1:29:39.487 --> 1:29:41.791
just like He did with me.

1:29:47.797 --> 1:29:51.867
Please, get up...

1:29:52.001 --> 1:29:57.773
and... now you all
need to believe something.

1:29:59.642 --> 1:30:01.844
I can't cure anyone anymore.

1:30:01.978 --> 1:30:04.647
But... I wasn't the one

1:30:04.780 --> 1:30:07.984
who really cured people
in the first place.

1:30:08.117 --> 1:30:10.319
It was God.

1:30:10.453 --> 1:30:14.657
He just told me what to do
and... I did it.

1:30:14.790 --> 1:30:15.925
The truth is...

1:30:16.058 --> 1:30:18.327
all of you can cure people.

1:30:18.461 --> 1:30:21.330
You really can.

1:30:21.464 --> 1:30:25.401
All you have to do is
believe in God and pray to Him,

1:30:25.533 --> 1:30:28.371
and He'll help you.

1:30:28.536 --> 1:30:31.974
Sometimes...
we can't see it right away.

1:30:32.108 --> 1:30:34.877
Or sometimes the answer

1:30:35.011 --> 1:30:37.079
isn't exactly
what you've prayed for, but...

1:30:37.213 --> 1:30:39.415
He's listening.

1:30:39.547 --> 1:30:44.186
And soon you'll see how kind
and how wonderful He is.

1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:46.521
He's the best.

1:30:49.658 --> 1:30:52.328
He told me to tell you...

1:30:52.461 --> 1:30:58.401
to... love your children
and your families,

1:30:58.533 --> 1:31:02.204
and to try to help one another
every day.

1:31:04.539 --> 1:31:07.977
So...
when you all go home tonight...

1:31:08.110 --> 1:31:10.880
say a prayer
and ask what you can do

1:31:11.013 --> 1:31:15.418
to make your family strong
and to help other people.

1:31:15.550 --> 1:31:18.687
God <i>will</i> help you, because...

1:31:18.821 --> 1:31:22.391
well...

1:31:22.525 --> 1:31:25.194
He loves you all...

1:31:25.327 --> 1:31:27.296
a lot.

1:31:42.244 --> 1:31:44.447
...and, well, the expression,
"God works in mysterious ways"

1:31:44.579 --> 1:31:46.248
certainly rung true
in our community

1:31:46.382 --> 1:31:48.317
over the last week or so.

1:31:48.451 --> 1:31:50.986
As a matter of fact, on that
country road the other night,

1:31:51.120 --> 1:31:53.923
I was certain <i>I</i> was gonna meet
my maker... several times.

1:31:57.726 --> 1:32:00.262
For all of us, each in our own,
different way,

1:32:00.396 --> 1:32:04.800
I think God has opened a door,
has shown us a little light,

1:32:04.934 --> 1:32:08.037
has shown us that His arms were
around us, around our friends,

1:32:08.170 --> 1:32:10.873
our family, both in this life
and in the next one.

1:32:11.006 --> 1:32:13.909
Can you feel Jesse with us?

1:32:14.043 --> 1:32:17.079
You know, uh... I can.

1:32:20.116 --> 1:32:25.087
So, some of us who have been
witness to... modern miracles

1:32:25.221 --> 1:32:29.191
can get a small taste of what
it was like to be an apostle.

1:32:29.325 --> 1:32:32.862
For in their presence was
the one continuing miracle,

1:32:32.995 --> 1:32:34.663
the miracle
that we can all choose

1:32:34.797 --> 1:32:38.267
to accompany us
through our lives...

1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:40.169
the presence of God.

1:32:56.519 --> 1:32:57.653
See, Daddy?

1:32:57.786 --> 1:32:59.421
It's like Jesus said.

1:32:59.555 --> 1:33:05.161
Faith as small as a mustard seed
can grow and spread,

1:33:05.294 --> 1:33:08.598
and soon become big enough
to move mountains.

1:33:10.634 --> 1:33:12.701
