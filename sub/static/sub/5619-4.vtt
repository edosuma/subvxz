00:02.586 --> 00:05.048
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:05.340 --> 00:06.341
Fitz!

00:06.424 --> 00:07.592
<i>You are safe.</i>

00:07.676 --> 00:08.927
That portal won't open again.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.179
But it has to. I have to go back.

00:11.262 --> 00:12.847
I'm on my third hand.

00:12.931 --> 00:15.016
<i>May took off on vacation
and never came back,</i>

00:15.100 --> 00:16.351
<i>so I lost my right hand too.</i>

00:16.434 --> 00:17.519
Things keep coming at us.

00:17.602 --> 00:19.354
New Inhumans. The ATCU.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.689
<i>And this new guy,
you should have seen him.</i>

00:20.772 --> 00:22.565
<i>It was a whole new level.</i>

00:26.111 --> 00:27.612
Do you even know who the hell I am?

00:27.696 --> 00:29.280
You're Werner Von Strucker.

00:29.364 --> 00:32.033
Your father was
one of HYDRA's greatest leaders.

00:32.116 --> 00:34.202
HYDRA's fractured.
We're going to rebuild it.

00:34.285 --> 00:35.704
- Dr Garner?
- Yeah.

00:35.787 --> 00:37.122
I was hoping to add your class.

00:38.456 --> 00:40.542
I plan to put Ward six feet underground.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.211
- What's your way in?
- From below. Climb the ranks.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.134
You certainly don't make it easy
to get a meeting.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.969
The boss doesn't want it to be easy.

00:51.094 --> 00:54.055
But he's always interested in meeting
people that can prove themselves.

01:09.738 --> 01:11.156
I can't tell.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.907
I can't tell just by looking at it.
Can you?

01:12.991 --> 01:14.743
Nobody can. It's chicken.

01:15.952 --> 01:18.997
I think I'm gonna have to cut into it.
There's nothing worse than dry chicken.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.248
Yeah. I got you.

01:20.749 --> 01:22.000
Thanks.

01:25.628 --> 01:26.963
Are you expecting someone?

01:27.505 --> 01:28.506
No.

01:37.515 --> 01:38.933
No way.

01:39.017 --> 01:41.019
Alisha? What're you doing here?

01:41.144 --> 01:42.270
Hey.

01:42.771 --> 01:45.690
Sorry to drop by like this,
but it's important.

01:46.024 --> 01:47.692
The Terrigen got out.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.197
When we saw Lincoln
in the news,

01:52.322 --> 01:54.282
and all that stuff about
a government task force...

01:54.365 --> 01:56.367
We knew it was bad.
We just didn't know how bad.

01:56.451 --> 01:57.660
The world sees us as a threat.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.370
We need to stick together.

01:59.496 --> 02:01.956
Those of us who've been here
since before the outbreak.

02:02.499 --> 02:04.793
Wait, are you the one who sent us
that weird email the other day?

02:04.876 --> 02:05.960
What email?

02:06.044 --> 02:07.545
The one about finding
the rest of our people.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.838
Bringing them back together.

02:09.047 --> 02:11.716
No. Can you show it to me?

02:17.138 --> 02:18.139
No!

02:33.029 --> 02:34.239
Alisha, talk to me. What's happening?

02:34.322 --> 02:36.324
She's dead! He killed her! It's her.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.742
Daisy, Mack, move in now!

02:38.409 --> 02:41.162
<i>Something's attacking! Alisha's down!</i>

02:50.755 --> 02:52.048
No.

02:53.258 --> 02:55.844
Sir, we've got three dead.
We're gonna need backup.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.262
It looks like the killer's on the...

02:57.929 --> 02:59.430
Daisy, wait! Daisy!

03:00.557 --> 03:02.433
- Damn it!
<i>- Alisha!</i>

03:02.767 --> 03:04.269
Alisha, can you hear me?

03:06.938 --> 03:09.524
He's here. He's here to kill us.

03:11.109 --> 03:12.610
And you can't stop him.

03:17.407 --> 03:19.617
I assure you, we're looking
for the suspects right now.

03:19.742 --> 03:22.954
Please, just go back into your
apartments and lock your doors.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.372
Thank you for your cooperation.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.874
Detective.

03:29.127 --> 03:30.295
Think they bought it?

03:30.420 --> 03:32.130
Don't know. The old lady's a trickster.

03:32.255 --> 03:35.300
Had her hand on one of those
911 red-alert necklaces.

03:35.425 --> 03:38.636
We don't have much time before
the official authorities get here.

03:38.761 --> 03:41.139
Gather whatever you can find
before we lose the scene.

03:41.222 --> 03:43.057
I thought this was just supposed
to be a recruiting mission?

03:43.141 --> 03:44.475
It was.

03:44.809 --> 03:46.811
I don't know
where this attack came from.

03:46.895 --> 03:48.146
Is Alisha going to be okay?

03:48.271 --> 03:49.397
She felt it happen.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.774
Went into shock. Med team's
evac-ing her to containment now.

03:53.276 --> 03:56.154
Before the attack, she said something
about the couple getting an email.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.323
- Fitz...
- Laptop. On it.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.909
What about Daisy and Mack?
They could use backup out there.

04:00.992 --> 04:02.911
I know you really want to
get back into action, Agent Morse,

04:02.994 --> 04:04.078
but the answer's no.

04:04.495 --> 04:07.165
You're still rehabbing.
You haven't passed the physical.

04:07.290 --> 04:08.958
Understood, sir.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.127
Daisy, what's your location?

04:12.003 --> 04:13.171
<i>Daisy, do you copy?</i>

04:13.671 --> 04:15.173
You're cutting in and out, sir.

04:15.298 --> 04:17.257
We've trailed the killer
to the industrial park

04:17.341 --> 04:18.760
a half a mile south of you.

04:18.843 --> 04:20.178
Backup would be nice.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.596
<i>On its way. Hold tight.</i>

04:21.678 --> 04:22.722
Copy that.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.312
How'd I let you talk me into this?

04:29.395 --> 04:30.480
I had a garage,

04:30.563 --> 04:32.982
workbench full of new tools,
my own espresso machine.

04:33.066 --> 04:35.860
We got to figure out
how this thing's finding Inhumans,

04:35.944 --> 04:37.278
and why it's killing them.

04:37.362 --> 04:38.404
I know why.

04:39.489 --> 04:40.865
Yeah? Why?

04:41.157 --> 04:42.492
Instinct.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.790
It's like a great white shark.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.333
Built to eat, sleep...

04:50.416 --> 04:51.459
And kill.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.127
I was gonna say
"make little baby sharks."

04:53.211 --> 04:56.130
But then <i>Jaws</i> was probably
20 years before you were born, so...

04:59.092 --> 05:00.134
Do we have movement?

05:00.218 --> 05:02.387
I don't know.
I can't see a damn thing.

05:04.806 --> 05:07.392
Well, do you want me to take point?

05:09.769 --> 05:11.646
I'm going. I'm going.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.323
Mmm.

05:23.783 --> 05:24.826
Found something.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.495
Could be from our monster.

05:29.789 --> 05:30.915
Oh. Blue, not clear.

05:30.999 --> 05:32.041
What?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.627
I said, "Blue. Not clear."

05:35.169 --> 05:36.838
How many times am I... Okay, look,

05:37.463 --> 05:39.132
Simmons and I have created a system.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.259
"B" is for blue is for biological sample.

05:41.342 --> 05:44.012
Right, another system.
How could I forget?

05:44.095 --> 05:46.848
Just saying, where I come from,
blue's for recycle.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.725
Well, that is insane.

05:48.808 --> 05:50.893
"R," I could understand.
R is for red is for...

05:50.977 --> 05:52.395
Regardless.

05:52.812 --> 05:55.690
We could use Simmons' eyes
on these samples.

05:55.773 --> 05:56.899
Think she'd be up for that?

05:57.483 --> 05:58.860
Er, I don't know.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.529
Heard you guys had dinner.

06:01.738 --> 06:02.822
Mmm-hmm.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.532
She open up to you at all?

06:04.615 --> 06:06.034
- About what happened to her?
- Not really.

06:07.326 --> 06:08.828
Why?

06:08.911 --> 06:10.288
Did she say something to you?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.666
No.

06:15.835 --> 06:17.712
- Helicopters.
- We need to move.

06:25.595 --> 06:27.180
It's got to be long gone.

06:27.263 --> 06:29.057
I mean, something that big
can't just slip away without...

06:31.059 --> 06:33.686
Damn it. I had to jinx it, didn't I?

06:34.854 --> 06:36.397
Sounds like
something's trying to get out.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.900
Or in.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.109
Come on.

06:46.032 --> 06:47.075
Three.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.411
Two.

06:52.038 --> 06:53.122
Drop your weapons!
Get down on the floor!

06:53.206 --> 06:55.583
- Get down!
- Get down! Put it down!

06:55.666 --> 06:57.543
- Get down!
- Lower your weapons!

06:57.627 --> 07:00.254
Stand down!
Everybody, stand down.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.465
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s not the enemy.

07:02.548 --> 07:06.260
And you definitely don't want to piss off
the young Agent Johnson here.

07:07.637 --> 07:10.014
We've got about 19 "Agent Johnsons"
on our side.

07:10.098 --> 07:12.183
Though none that can
take down a building.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.227
Rosalind Price, by the way.

07:14.310 --> 07:16.062
- Coulson?
- It's okay.

07:16.145 --> 07:17.438
The ATCU is here to help.

07:17.522 --> 07:18.648
Really? 'Cause the other day,

07:18.731 --> 07:20.566
they wanted Daisy's head
for their trophy case.

07:20.650 --> 07:22.944
- Agent Mackenzie!
- Bit of an exaggeration.

07:23.027 --> 07:24.904
But that was then, and this is now.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.405
And right now,
we're here to contain a threat.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.573
Same as you.

07:27.657 --> 07:29.325
- Fan out!
- Go.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.916
I get that you cut a deal with them,
but for the record...

07:36.999 --> 07:38.543
It's a means to an end.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.212
Ours or theirs?

07:51.139 --> 07:53.808
Bag everything,
computers, clothes, phones.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.892
Anything they've touched.

07:55.017 --> 07:56.561
Where are you taking the victims?

07:58.062 --> 07:59.230
That's classified.

08:01.566 --> 08:04.068
Oh, it's not fun when it's you, right?

08:04.527 --> 08:06.904
Can't believe I just said that
to the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.991
You know, I'm really not feeling
the spirit of cooperation here.

08:10.074 --> 08:13.494
Yeah, we had an agreement.
You were supposed to share intel.

08:13.578 --> 08:15.496
And I did. 'Cause, look, you're here.

08:15.580 --> 08:18.416
How'd you find them, Coulson?
And why wasn't I informed?

08:18.499 --> 08:21.586
You were informed,
as soon as we engaged the hostile.

08:21.711 --> 08:23.921
I'm talking about before you got here.

08:25.506 --> 08:27.758
This is the first time
I've encountered a couple like this.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.218
How so?

08:29.552 --> 08:33.847
This wasn't the usual response call
to deal with somebody who just turned.

08:34.182 --> 08:35.433
Look around.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.601
No cocoons.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.437
Maybe it didn't happen here.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.273
Shane and Lori Hanson.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.276
They lived here for the last 18 months

08:45.359 --> 08:47.945
and yet never visited
an emergency room,

08:48.446 --> 08:51.115
never missed time at work,
didn't socialise with co-workers,

08:51.240 --> 08:52.783
had zero presence online.

08:52.909 --> 08:54.285
So they were introverts.

08:54.410 --> 08:57.038
They were already Enhanced
before the outbreak.

08:57.121 --> 09:01.250
So I will ask you again,
in the "spirit of cooperation."

09:03.211 --> 09:04.795
How'd you find them, Coulson?

09:05.796 --> 09:07.965
- They were friends of a friend.
- You mean Daisy's friends.

09:08.049 --> 09:09.050
Look, we could do this all day.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.885
But there's an Enhanced person
out there killing people.

09:10.968 --> 09:13.888
And I'd really like to catch him.
Are you gonna help or not?

09:15.306 --> 09:17.266
I like when you get all tough.

09:21.229 --> 09:25.399
All right. We'll take it from here.
I'll call if I find anything.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.279
You're welcome, by the way.

09:30.655 --> 09:33.741
Oh, don't take it personally, Phil.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.744
I'm sure you have other
evildoers out there to catch.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.164
Nice haul.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.333
New recruit brought you these?

09:42.458 --> 09:46.337
Yeah. Same bloke who brought these
took out Spud last week.

09:46.462 --> 09:48.339
He's a tough bastard.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.759
I like that he didn't come empty-handed.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.095
Might be helpful on the next job.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.596
Whatever that is.

09:56.097 --> 09:58.349
Sorry, Kebo, that's Level 7.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.143
Level 7? Right.

10:02.937 --> 10:04.188
I'm messing with you.

10:05.022 --> 10:06.524
It was a S.H.I.E.L.D. thing.

10:07.191 --> 10:10.695
One of their ridiculous
codes of bureaucracy.

10:10.820 --> 10:13.489
Though, I will say, there are a few
things that S.H.I.E.L.D. got right.

10:14.865 --> 10:19.704
Things they valued. And I don't mean
money, or power, or resources.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.872
Take this job, for instance.

10:21.956 --> 10:24.834
It's all about accountability. Patience.

10:25.126 --> 10:28.004
An attention to detail that requires

10:29.130 --> 10:30.548
a personal touch.

10:31.382 --> 10:33.009
Those kinds of things
mattered at S.H.I.E.L.D.

10:36.554 --> 10:39.056
Almost a shame
we're gonna bring it all down.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.349
<i>So, what's the job?</i>

10:40.725 --> 10:41.809
Don't know.

10:41.892 --> 10:42.893
- When's it going down?
- Don't know.

10:43.019 --> 10:44.145
Any idea where?

10:44.228 --> 10:45.646
Not yet.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.648
You do realise the point
of intelligence gathering

10:47.732 --> 10:48.899
is to gather intelligence?

10:48.983 --> 10:51.652
The point is,
I'm moving up the food chain.

10:51.736 --> 10:54.405
And that lunatic Kebo is finally
bringing me in on a job.

10:54.530 --> 10:56.240
Or luring you into a trap.

10:56.365 --> 10:57.491
We have to be smart about this.

10:57.575 --> 11:00.578
It's not complicated, really.
Just point, shoot, repeat as necessary.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.747
You don't have enough intel. It's sloppy.

11:02.872 --> 11:05.124
If it's a chance to find Ward,
it's worth it.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.710
What happens if you walk into
a roomful of HYDRA enforcers

11:07.793 --> 11:09.253
with guns pointed at your head?

11:09.337 --> 11:12.089
That's what you're here for, to help.
Try to keep up, love.

11:12.173 --> 11:13.799
This isn't funny, Hunter.

11:14.133 --> 11:16.052
What if there are innocent lives at risk?

11:16.135 --> 11:18.763
There's always lives at risk!

11:19.764 --> 11:21.307
You were there,

11:21.557 --> 11:24.268
when Bobbi was bleeding out
in my arms.

11:24.352 --> 11:26.228
Ward did that.

11:26.312 --> 11:29.231
If I have a shot at finding him,
I'm taking it.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.816
I have to.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.319
Before Bobbi gets back in the field.

11:34.028 --> 11:35.196
Look,

11:36.155 --> 11:38.783
I want Ward as bad as you do.

11:39.450 --> 11:42.370
But I don't think his life
is worth yours or Bobbi's.

11:42.453 --> 11:44.580
Well, on that, we can agree.

11:47.500 --> 11:50.669
Once you get the time and place,
call me.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.880
Yes, mum.

12:15.403 --> 12:16.695
<i>The DNA results came in.</i>

12:16.779 --> 12:18.322
They confirm the killer is an Inhuman.

12:18.406 --> 12:20.866
- He's killing his own kind.
- I don't get it.

12:20.950 --> 12:22.493
If he knows what it's like,
what we go through,

12:22.576 --> 12:25.621
I refuse to believe Mack's
"great white shark" theory.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.581
He's not some mindless
wrecking machine.

12:27.665 --> 12:30.459
Agreed. The killer's tracking its prey.
The question is, how?

12:30.543 --> 12:31.627
Alisha knew these people.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.379
They were friends of hers
before the outbreak.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.505
Maybe the killer was, too.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.507
It's possible.
But before Alisha was attacked,

12:36.590 --> 12:38.843
the couple mentioned that
they got some weird email, right?

12:39.343 --> 12:42.096
Well, that email had
a nasty virus attached to it.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.432
It chewed up their operating system
like a blender.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.100
I was able to un-mangle it,

12:46.183 --> 12:48.727
and it looks like the virus
was planted to track their location.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.521
Do we know of any other Inhumans
who got this email?

12:50.896 --> 12:53.774
Joey Gutierrez didn't, I checked.
But the others, I don't know.

12:53.858 --> 12:56.152
It's not like we have a ton
of candidates to work with.

12:56.861 --> 12:59.488
Reach out to the ATCU,
let them know what you found.

13:00.322 --> 13:03.200
Taking this "team spirit" thing
a little far, aren't we?

13:03.284 --> 13:05.661
Fitz and I grabbed that laptop
before they got there,

13:05.744 --> 13:07.121
why would we share this intel?

13:07.204 --> 13:10.124
We know the ATCU has found
Inhumans in the past.

13:10.207 --> 13:12.001
Confiscated all their belongings.

13:12.084 --> 13:13.961
Let's see if they've come across
this virus before.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.796
If we share with them,
what do we get in return?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.089
- What do you want?
- I don't know.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.883
Let's start with how many Inhumans
they've come across.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.885
- Where they take them.
- Daisy has a good point, sir.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.720
We don't know
nearly enough about them.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.139
I agree. But if we want answers,
then we've got to play ball.

13:25.222 --> 13:28.392
Share the intel.
Trace the virus to its source.

13:32.313 --> 13:34.815
It was bitter. Not sweet at all.

13:35.608 --> 13:38.360
I'd imagined the taste of
a fresh strawberry for months.

13:38.444 --> 13:40.946
But, like most things, since being back,

13:41.030 --> 13:42.364
it just wasn't what I'd remembered.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.617
Most things aren't.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.535
Memories have a funny way
of changing on you

13:46.619 --> 13:47.912
when you're not looking.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.582
How about you? You feel any different
since you've been back?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.084
Besides your taste buds, I mean.

13:54.418 --> 13:56.212
Any trouble sleeping?

13:56.295 --> 13:57.630
- Or anxiety?
- No.

13:57.713 --> 14:01.175
Shock? Rage? Depression?

14:01.258 --> 14:05.137
I know you're looking for signs of PTSD,
but I assure you, I'm fine.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.515
You've been through something
pretty extreme.

14:07.598 --> 14:11.018
There will be after-effects.
And that's okay. It's okay to struggle.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.437
To feel uncomfortable in your own skin.

14:13.521 --> 14:15.689
I'm not one of your
Inhuman patients, Dr Garner.

14:15.773 --> 14:17.566
No. No, you're not.

14:19.193 --> 14:22.488
But survivor stories
have always fascinated me.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.365
How they got through it.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.659
The Chilean miners relied on routine.

14:26.742 --> 14:29.453
Work, exercise, rest.
Gave each other jobs.

14:29.537 --> 14:30.955
They had each other.

14:31.038 --> 14:35.084
Not all of them. One hiker
was stranded on Mount Hood

14:35.167 --> 14:36.502
for six nights in the snow.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.672
Said her faith saved her.

14:40.297 --> 14:44.134
That, and the thought of
all the loose ends she left behind.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.679
The people she cared about.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.932
She never gave up hope.

14:51.183 --> 14:52.643
I did.

14:56.647 --> 14:59.608
You remember a specific moment
when that happened?

14:59.692 --> 15:02.861
Honestly, I'd rather
look forward than back.

15:02.945 --> 15:05.322
I have a very interesting new project
that I'm trying to focus on.

15:05.406 --> 15:07.950
It's okay. You don't have
to talk about it.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.368
Just know

15:10.119 --> 15:12.955
you've got a lot of friends here
who care a lot about you.

15:13.581 --> 15:16.125
You're safe now, Jemma. It's over.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.549
You're wrong.

15:25.509 --> 15:27.553
She puts up a good front,
but I'm worried about her.

15:27.636 --> 15:28.679
You should be.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.557
The woman was stranded alone
on a barren, alien world for months.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.435
She's dealing with a lot of emotions
and won't open up about any of them.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.980
I know you can't discuss specifics,
but is she making any progress?

15:38.063 --> 15:40.608
You can't rush her.
No field work. And I mean it, Phil.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.817
And when I give you a recommendation,

15:41.900 --> 15:42.985
I want you to respect it this time.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.445
Wait. What are you talking about?

15:44.528 --> 15:46.280
I'm talking about the Inhuman
you have in containment.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.325
You know, the one I never even met,
let alone cleared for a mission?

15:49.408 --> 15:52.077
Alisha came to us.
She was worried about her friends.

15:52.161 --> 15:53.245
And how many more like her
are you hiding?

15:53.329 --> 15:54.580
That's not what we're doing.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.956
These people have problems.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.374
I'm not just gonna turn a blind eye

15:57.458 --> 15:59.043
and rubber stamp them
for your new team.

15:59.126 --> 16:02.504
And I'm not asking you to.
This was a simple recruitment mission.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.715
Alisha wanted to go.
Nobody saw that attack coming.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.009
You trying to justify that to me,

16:07.092 --> 16:08.719
or to yourself?

16:16.894 --> 16:17.936
May?

16:18.020 --> 16:19.355
Coulson.

16:19.438 --> 16:20.481
Andrew.

16:22.650 --> 16:24.652
Am I interrupting something?

16:27.529 --> 16:29.823
I can't believe Hunter
reached out to you like that.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.576
I specifically told everyone to give you
space while you were on leave.

16:32.660 --> 16:35.371
- Man's on a mission. He's desperate.
- How desperate?

16:35.454 --> 16:36.789
His latest bad idea,

16:36.872 --> 16:40.209
walking into a HYDRA stronghold alone
for a shot at finding Ward.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.252
I admire his courage.
Sounds like suicide.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.587
Ward knows Hunter's face.

16:43.671 --> 16:46.006
If there's a chance
they run into each other on this job...

16:46.090 --> 16:47.132
Hunter needs backup.

16:47.216 --> 16:48.300
More than I can provide.

16:48.384 --> 16:49.593
That's saying a lot.

16:49.677 --> 16:52.596
Most of our resources are focused
on a manhunt right now,

16:52.680 --> 16:54.098
or a monster hunt.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.558
But if this leads to Ward,
that would be huge.

16:56.642 --> 16:57.685
When is Hunter going in?

16:58.227 --> 16:59.728
I'm waiting on specifics.

16:59.812 --> 17:03.440
But I know Hunter's been operating
primarily on the Eastern Seaboard.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.983
He's in too deep, Phil.
It's affected his judgement.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.448
- What?
- It's like you never left.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.367
But I did.

17:15.786 --> 17:18.414
Look, I'm sorry Andrew's here.
I didn't mean to make it more awkward.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.958
It's fine, we're all professionals.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.542
Yeah. But we're also friends.

17:23.836 --> 17:24.877
If the reason you haven't come back

17:24.962 --> 17:26.714
- is because we're working with him...
- It's not.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.466
I told you
I can find someone else to consult...

17:29.550 --> 17:30.718
Don't.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.220
Andrew's really good at what he does.
You need him.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.681
Yeah, but I can replace him.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.807
You, not so much.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.644
What happened with you two?

17:43.355 --> 17:46.692
The reason Andrew left me
had nothing to do with S.H.I.E.L.D.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.402
It's about me.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.862
Always has been.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.449
You're too hard on yourself,
you know that?

17:57.494 --> 17:58.746
Hey. No tie?

17:59.621 --> 18:01.081
Still practising.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.167
Look better without it.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.918
Thanks.

18:06.962 --> 18:09.131
I'll call you as soon
as Hunter reaches out.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.097
The hairs are deteriorating.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.392
That's odd.

18:22.311 --> 18:23.771
Did you place it in the right receptacle?

18:23.854 --> 18:25.898
- And double-checked the seal.
- And the stain?

18:25.981 --> 18:28.358
Fitz, we're dealing with Inhuman DNA.
Anything's possible.

18:30.527 --> 18:31.653
I'll check it again.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.625
What's all this?

18:47.503 --> 18:49.338
Data on the Monolith?

18:50.506 --> 18:51.590
Schematics.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.803
There's notes all over this
in Simmons' handwriting.

18:56.470 --> 18:57.554
Seismic mounts.

18:57.638 --> 18:58.764
What are you doing?

18:58.847 --> 19:00.808
- Jemma, I'm just trying to...
- No, don't!

19:00.891 --> 19:03.519
Those are mine,
and now they're all out of order.

19:03.602 --> 19:05.145
And, you, what did you tell him?

19:05.229 --> 19:06.438
Jemma, relax.

19:06.522 --> 19:08.607
We were just analysing
the Inhuman's DNA.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.734
All this data, what's it for?

19:10.818 --> 19:13.153
Just stay away from my things.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.663
What just happened?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.665
Did she say something to you?

19:26.208 --> 19:27.709
It should come from her.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.553
- Thought you left.
- I was waiting for you.

19:37.636 --> 19:39.471
- Are you back?
- No.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.765
Melinda, can we talk?

19:41.849 --> 19:44.351
- That's what we're doing.
- Not here.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.853
Could you slow up
for a second, please?

19:45.936 --> 19:48.689
Honestly, Andrew,
I don't need to hear any more apologies.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.483
We went away to figure out
who we'd be outside of S.H.I.E.L.D.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.151
You didn't like what you saw.
Let's move on.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.862
That's not true.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.196
I had a great time.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.409
So did I.
Until you fell off the face of the Earth.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.702
No calls, no texts.

20:01.785 --> 20:02.828
That had nothing to do with you.

20:02.911 --> 20:05.622
Please. Don't give me
the "It's not you, it's me" speech.

20:05.706 --> 20:07.207
You can do better than that.

20:07.291 --> 20:08.792
You're right,

20:09.585 --> 20:12.921
I can do better. And I want to,
I'd just rather not do it here.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.550
Now, maybe after my class tomorrow,

20:16.633 --> 20:17.968
- you could come by...
- I don't think so.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.179
Damn it, Melinda,
I know I've handled this all wrong.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.390
I shouldn't have walked away like I did.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.560
I did the same to you.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.729
Now, we're even.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.490
I reached out to the ATCU
and talked to that guy Banks.

20:40.574 --> 20:42.492
- What'd he give you?
- Besides a case of the creeps,

20:42.576 --> 20:44.077
he said the virus I found was sent out

20:44.161 --> 20:45.579
to the other Inhumans
they've come across.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.164
They just didn't spot it.

20:47.247 --> 20:49.625
See? Cooperation pays off.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.876
It was hardly cooperation.

20:50.959 --> 20:53.754
Not only didn't they find the virus,
but they couldn't trace it either.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.088
I'm guessing you did.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.716
Meet Dwight Frye.

20:57.799 --> 21:00.802
Former programmer,
serial online gamer, and IT guy.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.304
The killer has an IT guy?

21:02.387 --> 21:05.349
What if he was one before he changed?

21:05.849 --> 21:07.684
Interesting theory.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.686
He works for the Social Security
Administration.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.021
Yeah, but he hasn't
been there in weeks.

21:11.104 --> 21:13.106
He'd have access
to all kinds of records.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.232
Be able to track people.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.860
Forget that.
How did the ATCU not track him?

21:16.944 --> 21:18.820
He's one of their own.
He's a government employee.

21:18.904 --> 21:20.530
You think the ATCU knew about him?

21:21.156 --> 21:22.366
Worse.

21:23.825 --> 21:24.868
What if they're running him?

21:24.952 --> 21:28.705
I think the conspiracy nut in you
had a few too many lattes this morning.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.582
I did have a latte. It was a double.

21:30.666 --> 21:34.002
But if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were defending the ATCU.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.338
Or the Dragon Lady.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.589
I assume you mean Rosalind.

21:37.673 --> 21:40.217
There's that first name thing again.
It's a dead giveaway.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.136
I mean, don't feel bad,
she's sharp, attractive,

21:43.220 --> 21:45.430
head of a big, shady organisation...

21:45.514 --> 21:46.598
I don't like where this is going.

21:46.682 --> 21:47.724
You think I do?

21:47.808 --> 21:49.101
Go grab Mack and a flight team.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.812
We're gonna see what this Mr Frye
has to say for himself.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.189
Copy that.

22:06.576 --> 22:07.619
Look who's here.

22:08.662 --> 22:09.746
Her again?

22:09.830 --> 22:12.124
Remember, best behaviour. Coulson.

22:12.708 --> 22:15.127
Ms Price. See?
I called you first this time.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.503
Very nice of you.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.338
- Signs of life inside?
- All quiet.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.715
Perimeter's locked up.

22:19.798 --> 22:20.841
Once the threat's contained,

22:20.924 --> 22:22.634
our holding facility
is prepped to take him.

22:22.718 --> 22:23.885
I'd like to see that sometime.

22:23.969 --> 22:25.595
Make sure you're not going
all Guantanamo.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.556
Well, that can be arranged.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.224
As long as
I can get something in return.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.018
Like a visit to your secret base.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.520
Or maybe a ride
on that fancy new plane?

22:34.062 --> 22:35.897
You know that door
won't open itself, right?

23:19.274 --> 23:20.400
Hey.

23:21.109 --> 23:23.570
Hey. It's okay.
We're not here to hurt you.

23:23.653 --> 23:25.447
Please, get out, please...

23:26.656 --> 23:29.159
What? I...
I can't hear you. What'd you say?

23:29.701 --> 23:32.537
Get out! Get out! Get out!

23:32.621 --> 23:34.122
Get out! Get out!

23:36.166 --> 23:37.459
Get out!

23:41.421 --> 23:42.672
Daisy, you all right?

23:43.090 --> 23:45.008
Yeah. But he's not.

23:46.718 --> 23:49.763
Mr Frye.
Come out and say hello.

23:51.848 --> 23:53.558
- How hard did you hit him?
- Not that hard.

23:53.642 --> 23:54.893
- So, what's wrong with him?
- I don't know,

23:54.976 --> 23:56.728
but I don't think he's our guy.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.313
She's killing me.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.564
Get her out of here!

24:01.608 --> 24:04.402
He's having some kind of reaction
to our special friend here.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.529
You think?

24:05.904 --> 24:07.697
If we want answers,
might help if she's not here.

24:08.824 --> 24:10.408
Just a thought.

24:20.085 --> 24:23.004
Wow, pretty strong meds
you've got here.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.214
Ever since I turned,

24:24.297 --> 24:28.301
migraine hits me like a bus
any time I get close to one of...

24:29.136 --> 24:32.389
Whatever we are.
The rash is just a bonus.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.474
So you're a divining rod
for others like you.

24:35.058 --> 24:36.726
Is that how you find your victims?

24:36.810 --> 24:39.604
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:40.147 --> 24:43.150
We have all your computers.
We know about the virus.

24:43.233 --> 24:44.276
How you sent it to all of them.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.027
You're the brains
of the operation,

24:46.111 --> 24:49.156
and your giant pit bull
does all the killing for you, is that it?

24:52.701 --> 24:55.036
Where you going, Mr Frye?

24:55.120 --> 24:56.788
- What the...
- Be careful.

24:56.872 --> 24:58.206
It's got a laser finger.

25:06.339 --> 25:07.757
Talk to us.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.509
How'd you know
who these victims were?

25:09.593 --> 25:11.678
Lash gave me their names.

25:12.429 --> 25:14.806
All I did was track them down.

25:14.890 --> 25:18.351
Lash. Big guy, dreads,
likes to leave holes in people?

25:20.395 --> 25:22.480
- Sounds like our pit bull.
- Yeah, great.

25:22.856 --> 25:25.692
It's like good old Dwight here
will lead us right to him.

25:25.775 --> 25:26.902
I don't know where he is.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.653
He always comes to me.

25:28.737 --> 25:31.198
If all you did was track down the victims,
how do you know their names?

25:31.323 --> 25:33.116
Divine inspiration.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.994
You guys don't get it.

25:36.328 --> 25:38.914
You should be helping him,
not hunting him.

25:38.997 --> 25:41.374
Help him kill people.
'Cause, sure, that makes sense.

25:41.458 --> 25:45.086
Do you think he likes
doing what he's doing?

25:45.921 --> 25:47.088
He doesn't.

25:48.006 --> 25:51.843
Ever since I turned,
I feel like my skin is on fire

25:51.927 --> 25:53.845
and there's a jackhammer in my head.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.933
I wake up thinking that
the pain will go away,

25:59.059 --> 26:00.644
but it doesn't.

26:01.269 --> 26:04.898
The only thing that helps
is when Lash does his thing.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.110
Sends us freaks
back to where we belong.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.614
I didn't want this.

26:13.281 --> 26:15.533
And I know I'm not the only one.

26:19.621 --> 26:22.040
Mr Frye, we can help you.
But you have to trust me,

26:22.123 --> 26:23.917
this Lash is not some angel of mercy.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.752
No, he's no angel.

26:26.127 --> 26:29.214
He's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

26:36.805 --> 26:37.847
Andrew could help him.

26:37.931 --> 26:40.892
There's no way the ATCU has anyone
on their staff with his experience.

26:40.976 --> 26:42.602
Where are they taking him?
Do we even know?

26:42.686 --> 26:44.020
We can't just give them
free rein like this.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.272
We can't just look away.

26:46.398 --> 26:47.482
Mack, you accompany them.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.859
Check out the containment facility.

26:49.943 --> 26:51.695
Gather whatever intel you can,
report back to me.

26:51.778 --> 26:52.821
I should be on that truck, too, sir.

26:52.904 --> 26:55.240
We've got a major HYDRA operation
unfolding, I may need you.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.325
- Not as much as Frye needs me.
- Look, I don't like it, D.

26:57.409 --> 26:58.952
You were in their crosshairs
just the other day.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.829
Yeah, and look how that worked out.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.790
- We're ready to roll.
- Not quite yet.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.417
How heavily sedated is Frye?

27:05.500 --> 27:07.210
On a scale of one to 10, about a six.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.753
No one likes a drooler. Why?

27:08.837 --> 27:10.463
I need you to squeeze
two more into that truck.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.631
That's not what we agreed on.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.550
Sharing is a two-way street.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.260
We invited you to the party,
now we need to know

27:15.343 --> 27:17.304
what you're doing with the guests.

27:17.387 --> 27:19.806
Come on, Rosalind. Fair is fair.

27:23.018 --> 27:24.394
Just give me a minute.

27:32.235 --> 27:34.738
All right, hop on board.

27:48.126 --> 27:49.753
Do you really have a laser finger?

27:50.295 --> 27:52.464
Sorry. That's classified.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.685
Looks like your rehab's going well.

28:06.561 --> 28:08.021
Can't lie.

28:08.688 --> 28:10.398
Doesn't feel like it.

28:10.482 --> 28:13.735
I understand.
I read up on your surgeries.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.195
Two on the knee, three in the lung.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.030
What's left of it.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.199
Don't forget those fun-loving abscesses.

28:19.282 --> 28:22.827
Well, knowing you,
I'm sure you'll be 100% in no time.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.458
- I'm sorry I snapped before.
- No apology necessary.

28:28.541 --> 28:29.626
I thought you told Fitz what I told you...

28:29.709 --> 28:31.378
Jemma, seriously.

28:31.795 --> 28:33.046
Stop.

28:34.672 --> 28:38.301
I mean, here I am complaining to you,
after what you've been through.

28:39.344 --> 28:42.180
Have you told anyone else
that you want to go back?

28:44.516 --> 28:46.101
You might want to.

28:46.601 --> 28:48.728
There's someone in particular
who's really worried about you.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.147
I wonder who that might be.

28:51.981 --> 28:53.650
He's driving me nuts, you know.

28:53.733 --> 28:54.776
The other day, he snapped at me

28:54.859 --> 28:57.028
just because I put a bio-sample
into a clear specimen bag.

28:57.112 --> 29:00.407
Clear? Well,
"B" is for blue is for biological.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.327
And now I see how
that would drive you out of the lab.

29:04.411 --> 29:05.787
Actually,

29:07.122 --> 29:08.957
it's not all Fitz's fault.

29:09.124 --> 29:10.667
I just got this

29:11.251 --> 29:14.879
old familiar feeling in my gut
and had to run.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.881
What feeling is that?

29:19.217 --> 29:21.302
Like Hunter's in trouble.

29:34.774 --> 29:37.360
Clearly, punctuality
ain't one of HYDRA's core values.

29:38.236 --> 29:40.530
Funny. Hands on the car.

29:41.906 --> 29:44.367
I thought we were past all that.

29:44.451 --> 29:47.120
Got to make sure you're clean.
Director's orders.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.288
Director?

29:48.371 --> 29:50.206
It's a thing with the boss.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.667
Some kind of S.H.I.E.L.D. nonsense.

29:53.668 --> 29:56.421
- In you go, Richy.
- I ain't getting in the bloody boot.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.881
Stinks of rotten bananas in there.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.550
It does, doesn't it?

30:07.599 --> 30:09.434
Always in the bloody boot.

30:09.517 --> 30:11.853
Get comfy, now,
it's gonna be a long ride.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.980
When you say "long," how...

30:19.903 --> 30:21.237
I feel like we're driving in circles.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.656
I bet we are.

30:23.740 --> 30:26.743
Probably buying time for Mr Banks
to clean up their facility.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.495
You catch how fast he left the scene?

30:28.578 --> 30:31.206
Yeah. So he could get rid of anything
Roz doesn't want us to see.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.958
That, or he's prepping a cell for you.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.336
It's his funeral.

30:42.342 --> 30:43.676
I feel like his meds are wearing off.

31:19.671 --> 31:22.006
I only told them the truth.

31:23.091 --> 31:25.760
That you're being merciful.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.595
I'm not merciful.

31:28.179 --> 31:29.222
I'm necessary.

31:29.764 --> 31:31.724
No! No.

32:17.270 --> 32:18.479
What the hell happened?

32:18.896 --> 32:22.150
The ATCU brought us all to a local ER
to get checked out.

32:23.192 --> 32:24.736
You got a concussion,

32:24.819 --> 32:26.863
separated your shoulder.

32:27.530 --> 32:28.906
Everyone else make it?

32:29.282 --> 32:30.617
Not Frye.

32:31.367 --> 32:32.619
Lash killed him.

32:35.288 --> 32:36.789
Lucky he didn't kill you, too.

32:37.457 --> 32:38.916
Yeah. Lucky.

32:42.211 --> 32:43.963
What's up, D?
You're holding something back.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.092
I...

32:48.468 --> 32:49.719
I saw something.

32:51.179 --> 32:55.767
And I'm not sure, but I don't think
Lash is just some great white shark.

32:59.270 --> 33:01.689
I think he can turn into a person.

33:01.773 --> 33:03.566
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.152
You're telling me that
you saw him transform?

33:06.235 --> 33:07.403
Into a regular guy?

33:07.487 --> 33:10.948
It was all shadows, so I didn't get a good
look at him, but it would explain a lot.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.368
How he comes and goes,
disappears when he needs to.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.497
I mean, think about it, Mack,
he could be anybody.

33:19.248 --> 33:20.875
Good, you're awake.

33:22.752 --> 33:23.878
How're you feeling?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.255
Like a truck fell on me.

33:26.381 --> 33:27.924
At least you lived to tell the tale.

33:29.092 --> 33:30.968
Where's Coulson?
I've been trying to reach him.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.721
He's on a mission.
After a high-value target.

33:33.805 --> 33:36.057
A human one, so not your thing.

33:41.437 --> 33:44.023
- Yeah, that space...
- About that...

33:44.107 --> 33:45.191
- Okay?
- Yeah.

33:51.989 --> 33:53.366
Good luck.

33:54.742 --> 33:56.577
Coulson's leaving with a tac team?

33:56.661 --> 34:01.082
May and Hunter have a lead on Ward.
Sounds like a dodgy situation...

34:01.624 --> 34:02.750
Wait, they didn't tell you?

34:05.503 --> 34:06.546
I'm sorry.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.925
It's tough when people
keep things from you.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.701
- Wakey-wakey.
- Where are we?

34:39.786 --> 34:42.373
Welcome to where all the fun begins.

34:42.623 --> 34:45.501
Director's still mulling over
a codename for the place.

34:45.918 --> 34:48.004
"Nemesis," "Omega Point."

34:49.338 --> 34:52.175
Sounds a bit too S.H.I.E.L.D.
for my liking.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.886
Rumour has it,
Director spent some time with them.

34:56.512 --> 34:58.473
You planning some sort of raid?

35:00.725 --> 35:03.144
We're always planning something.

35:03.352 --> 35:05.146
You can ask the Director yourself.

35:05.938 --> 35:08.691
So, this the new guy?

35:08.775 --> 35:09.817
Yeah.

35:10.485 --> 35:11.903
Turn around, Richy.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.404
Yeah, Richy.

35:13.696 --> 35:15.323
Why so shy?

35:16.908 --> 35:18.201
My name isn't Richy,

35:21.078 --> 35:22.371
"Director."

35:25.374 --> 35:26.751
Get to cover!

35:32.298 --> 35:35.843
Check the perimeter.
Look for S.H.I.E.L.D. reinforcements.

35:40.890 --> 35:41.933
I got nothing.

35:42.558 --> 35:44.977
Not a man or a vehicle in sight!

35:49.565 --> 35:51.234
Come on, Hunter.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.986
You weren't actually dumb enough
to come here all cowboy, were you?

35:54.070 --> 35:57.240
Sorry, this coming from the guy
who shot his own girlfriend by mistake?

35:58.950 --> 36:02.370
I was hoping you were dead
and Bobbi was coming for me.

36:02.453 --> 36:05.248
At least that rematch
would've been more even.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.374
Hardly.

36:06.457 --> 36:09.335
I heard it took two of you.
After hours of torture.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.546
Yeah, lesson learned.

36:11.629 --> 36:13.673
Should've rigged the door
with a grenade.

36:31.649 --> 36:33.985
Took your bloody time.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.158
How many did you count?

36:41.242 --> 36:42.326
Eleven, including Ward.

36:42.410 --> 36:44.161
- I've taken out five.
- Slow day?

36:49.625 --> 36:52.086
May, is that you?

36:52.628 --> 36:54.881
Because that would be great.

36:56.841 --> 37:01.053
I mean, I was hoping
to hold out for a little while longer.

37:01.971 --> 37:03.931
Coulson, what's your ETA?

37:04.015 --> 37:06.267
We're still 20 minutes out
from your position.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.394
You need to get out of there, May,
right now.

37:09.145 --> 37:10.396
I'm not sure we can do that.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.149
I don't care if a fleet
of Helicarriers flies in here,

37:13.232 --> 37:14.817
that son of a bitch is mine.

37:19.822 --> 37:21.574
I'm so glad you're here, May.

37:21.657 --> 37:24.619
I was planning on heading out
with a truck full of weapons

37:24.702 --> 37:27.663
that Hunter so kindly supplied,

37:27.747 --> 37:30.374
looking to cause a little mayhem,

37:30.458 --> 37:32.460
draw S.H.I.E.L.D. out.

37:32.543 --> 37:36.047
When instead, you came to me.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.507
- You're trapped, Ward.
- Hey.

37:38.591 --> 37:39.759
Don't interrupt.

37:41.218 --> 37:44.388
Not before you see my surprise.

37:49.977 --> 37:53.147
That's a live feed,
in case you're wondering.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.942
Dr Garner's on his way
to teach a class right now.

37:56.359 --> 37:58.778
Psych 301, I believe.

37:58.861 --> 38:01.989
I've got my men on him right now.

38:04.283 --> 38:05.743
He's bluffing.

38:05.868 --> 38:10.748
Watching him die like this
isn't quite the same as, oh, let's say,

38:11.165 --> 38:13.709
holding the woman you love
in your arms

38:13.793 --> 38:16.712
while she breathes her last breath.

38:16.796 --> 38:18.297
But hey,

38:18.381 --> 38:21.550
it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

38:22.009 --> 38:24.053
He's trying to get in your head.
The video's fake.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.646
Hey. What you doing?

38:33.729 --> 38:35.064
Hey, Professor.

38:36.732 --> 38:37.984
Where you been?

38:38.442 --> 38:41.862
If I don't call off my men
in the next 30 seconds,

38:41.946 --> 38:45.992
Dr Andrew Garner, the ex-Mr May,

38:46.075 --> 38:47.618
is a dead man.

38:48.119 --> 38:51.539
All you have to do
is put your weapons down,

38:52.915 --> 38:54.333
and I'll let you go.

38:55.418 --> 38:56.585
Son of a bitch.

38:56.669 --> 38:57.962
You're lying!

38:58.045 --> 38:59.463
I'm not.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.049
I give you my word, May.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.431
You know, you're a tough guy
to track down.

39:11.559 --> 39:12.935
What's going on here, Alex?

39:26.365 --> 39:29.410
He has a warehouse full of guns here
that I brought him.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.870
A lot of people will die, May.

39:32.246 --> 39:33.622
May!

39:34.373 --> 39:36.208
It's Andrew.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.256
I'm sorry.

39:46.385 --> 39:47.678
No!

39:50.639 --> 39:51.724
<i>May, what's happening?</i>

39:51.807 --> 39:52.975
Come in!

39:53.059 --> 39:54.435
- May?
<i>- It's Andrew.</i>

39:54.518 --> 39:56.729
Ward's going to kill him.
You have to get to him.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.526
Come on! Come on!

41:20.521 --> 41:21.605
Come in.

41:25.151 --> 41:26.235
Thank you, Fitz,

41:26.318 --> 41:29.488
but there's no reason
to dote over me. I'm fine.

41:32.199 --> 41:35.202
Why do you want
to rebuild the portal, Jemma?

41:35.286 --> 41:36.954
I saw the schematics, the data,

41:37.037 --> 41:40.332
the astronomical research
you've been doing.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.628
And I just can't understand it.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.383
After everything you've been through,

41:50.467 --> 41:51.510
why would you...

41:51.594 --> 41:54.096
Because I have to get back there.

41:59.768 --> 42:01.395
And I need your help to do it.

42:06.775 --> 42:10.237
Something happened to me, Fitz,
on the other side.

42:11.739 --> 42:14.116
It's time I told you the truth.

42:14.575 --> 42:16.285
About everything.
