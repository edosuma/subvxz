Chris.

03:03.379 --> 03:04.371
Chris.

03:09.427 --> 03:10.418
Chris.

03:14.226 --> 03:18.160
Jesus Christ, Dad.

03:18.162 --> 03:19.602
What's wrong with you, man?

03:20.018 --> 03:21.682
It's afternoon,
what are you doing?

03:22.034 --> 03:23.506
School's finished.

03:24.243 --> 03:26.387
So what, you're just
gonna lie in bed all day?

03:27.154 --> 03:30.961
Give me a break, Jesus Christ.

03:30.963 --> 03:33.523
Get up, now!

03:34.035 --> 03:35.314
Oh, thanks.

03:37.298 --> 03:38.547
Real mature.

03:39.314 --> 03:40.563
Fucking asshole.

03:50.387 --> 03:51.282
Hey, sweetheart.

03:51.890 --> 03:53.361
Do you want something to eat?

03:53.363 --> 03:54.867
No, I'm good, thanks.

03:58.195 --> 03:59.250
All right, what?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.729
It's almost one o'clock.

04:03.731 --> 04:06.355
You okay with him
sleeping in so late?

04:06.676 --> 04:08.596
Richard, just don't start.

04:09.491 --> 04:11.923
Don't start, mm-hmm.

04:13.011 --> 04:14.577
He's been out of
school over a week now.

04:14.579 --> 04:17.457
All he does is hang around
the house, play video games,

04:17.459 --> 04:20.209
and hang out with his friends.

04:20.212 --> 04:21.488
I thought you were gonna go down

04:21.491 --> 04:22.836
to the recruitment
office and enlist.

04:23.891 --> 04:26.548
Can I take some time to
think about it first?

04:27.091 --> 04:28.401
What's there to think about?

04:28.403 --> 04:29.844
I thought you wanted
to join the Army.

04:31.732 --> 04:33.650
He's right, you know, okay?

04:33.652 --> 04:34.963
There's no rush.

04:35.988 --> 04:37.427
You taking his side now?

04:38.708 --> 04:40.786
Why do there have
to be any sides?

04:40.788 --> 04:42.641
He's only just
gotten out of school.

04:42.643 --> 04:44.627
Just let him have a break.

04:51.348 --> 04:54.066
So, what's your plan, Chris?

04:54.068 --> 04:55.795
Step up and take
some responsibility.

04:55.797 --> 04:57.522
Help your mom and I out.

04:57.524 --> 05:01.426
Go get a part time job, start
paying some bills around here.

05:01.428 --> 05:02.452
I've been looking.

05:02.644 --> 05:03.828
Yeah, not hard enough.

05:04.308 --> 05:06.004
Dad, give me a break.

05:11.124 --> 05:12.629
You're too soft on him.

05:13.876 --> 05:15.122
Oh great.

05:15.124 --> 05:16.594
You're gonna start on me now.

05:16.596 --> 05:18.196
Hey, I just
want what's best for him.

05:18.516 --> 05:20.628
And you think the
Army would be best.

05:20.915 --> 05:21.908
Don't you?

05:24.404 --> 05:27.537
Sending our son off
to risk his life?

05:27.539 --> 05:30.836
No, can't say that's
something that I want for him.

05:32.948 --> 05:34.450
He's always wanted
to join the Army.

05:34.452 --> 05:36.021
He's talked about
since he was a kid.

05:36.725 --> 05:40.659
Because you always talked
about how you wanted to enlist.

05:40.661 --> 05:42.742
But you couldn't,
because of the injury.

05:45.364 --> 05:49.493
Look, all boys grow up wanting
to please their father.

05:50.165 --> 05:52.242
He's trying to make you proud,

05:52.244 --> 05:55.318
by doing something that you
didn't get the chance to do.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.021
Well it sure doesn't
seem like that anymore.

06:03.381 --> 06:06.133
Maybe he just wants to let
you know he's a grownup.

06:07.349 --> 06:10.547
Look, don't you remember what
it was like to be that age?

06:10.549 --> 06:11.542
Hmm?

06:15.029 --> 06:17.267
Yeah, I was dumb
as a box of rocks.

06:17.269 --> 06:20.596
You were.

06:23.989 --> 06:26.038
God, Karen, you know,

06:27.510 --> 06:30.291
it's an important time
in his life, you know.

06:30.293 --> 06:33.075
I feel like if we don't
give him some kind of nudge,

06:33.077 --> 06:35.189
he's just gonna spend
years being a bum.

06:48.086 --> 06:49.845
It's a weird time right now.

06:50.774 --> 06:53.747
I mean, the average
person lives to what,

06:53.749 --> 06:55.987
70 or 80 years old?

06:55.989 --> 06:58.453
Yet here we are, 18.

06:59.381 --> 07:01.651
How the hell can one
false move at this age

07:01.653 --> 07:05.205
mean that the next 50 or 60
years are gonna be a total bust?

07:06.069 --> 07:07.766
It's a load of
crap, if you ask me.

07:09.013 --> 07:12.691
You know, in the Army, they
say you gotta start young.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.485
You're really gonna enlist?

07:17.750 --> 07:18.900
I'm not so sure.

07:20.469 --> 07:23.411
Well, if you want to talk
to someone who really served

07:23.413 --> 07:25.011
to get an insight,

07:25.013 --> 07:27.284
there's an old who lives on
the same street as my aunt.

07:27.286 --> 07:28.374
He was in the Army.

07:30.294 --> 07:31.731
- Oh yeah?
- Hmm.

07:31.733 --> 07:33.140
They say he was there on D-Day.

07:33.142 --> 07:36.726
I think he won a Medal
of Honor or something.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.029
Everyone calls him Hawkeye.

08:15.894 --> 08:18.135
Hey old timer,
what's in the bag?

08:21.783 --> 08:23.382
None of your fucking
business, that's what.

08:23.959 --> 08:26.356
Hey, no need to be rude.

08:26.358 --> 08:27.799
We're just here to help
you carry that home.

08:28.086 --> 08:30.198
Couple of Boy Scouts,
eh?

08:31.415 --> 08:33.076
There's me thinking
you were two rent boys

08:33.078 --> 08:34.164
out hustling for business.

08:34.167 --> 08:35.543
Hey, fuck you, old man.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.669
Look, before we
go down this road,

08:39.671 --> 08:41.205
there's something you
two ought to know.

08:41.207 --> 08:42.707
Oh yeah, what's that?

08:42.710 --> 08:45.751
I'm mean, nasty, too
old to take your shit.

08:47.031 --> 08:48.565
Check out the mouth on gramps.

08:48.567 --> 08:50.677
Yeah, you've been fun.

08:50.679 --> 08:52.471
Almost a pity to
have to rob your ass.

08:58.519 --> 08:59.605
Give me your fucking wallet.

08:59.607 --> 09:00.853
Afraid not, son.

09:00.855 --> 09:02.229
Oh really, I really
didn't quite...

09:02.231 --> 09:03.159
Yeah, you did.

09:03.607 --> 09:06.262
Now do yourselves a favor
and go back to the Scout Hut

09:06.264 --> 09:07.351
before someone gets hurt.

09:07.607 --> 09:09.429
Only one who's
getting hurt is you.

09:10.487 --> 09:11.991
Hand over the fucking wallet...

09:39.159 --> 09:40.151
Thanks.

09:40.888 --> 09:42.390
Is that your wife?

09:42.392 --> 09:43.221
Sure is.

09:43.223 --> 09:44.791
Married almost 50 years.

09:46.071 --> 09:47.992
She pass away?

09:48.662 --> 09:51.703
Yes, almost two years ago.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.581
Sorry to hear that.

09:54.583 --> 09:56.150
Thank you.

09:56.152 --> 09:57.431
That your son?

09:58.391 --> 09:59.383
Yeah.

10:00.215 --> 10:01.976
He lives in Connecticut.

10:07.063 --> 10:10.454
So are you
gonna call the cops?

10:10.456 --> 10:11.193
Why?

10:12.120 --> 10:14.294
Those two guys, they
should be in jail.

10:14.296 --> 10:15.702
Cops don't give a shit
about what happens

10:15.704 --> 10:17.046
in this neighborhood,

10:17.048 --> 10:18.550
and they sure as hell
don't give a shit

10:18.552 --> 10:20.217
about a broken-down
old fuck like me.

10:20.889 --> 10:24.473
So tell me something, kid,
what are you doing here today?

10:25.400 --> 10:26.808
I think I could
learn a lot from you.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.040
And what do I get
out of the deal?

10:30.648 --> 10:31.671
What do you want?

10:31.673 --> 10:33.561
Did you see that yard?

10:33.752 --> 10:34.741
Sure.

10:34.743 --> 10:36.025
Real shit hole, isn't it?

10:36.696 --> 10:38.040
I guess.

10:38.232 --> 10:41.305
0800 tomorrow, I want you
to start mowing that lawn.

10:42.361 --> 10:43.542
When you're done with that,

10:43.544 --> 10:45.081
I'll tell you what
you wanna know.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.384
I don't think
that's... I don't know.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.585
Oh, guns don't scare
you, but hard labor does.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.463
It doesn't scare
me, sir, it's just...

10:53.465 --> 10:55.802
Well good, I'll see
you in the morning.

11:18.937 --> 11:21.049
When did you first
join the Army?

11:21.753 --> 11:24.473
I was drafted April 25th, 1941.

11:25.369 --> 11:28.791
My first assignment was to
the 175th Infantry Regiment,

11:28.793 --> 11:31.417
Company C, of the 29th
Infantry Division.

11:32.250 --> 11:36.087
Early in 1943, we were sent
to Glen Spean, Scotland,

11:36.089 --> 11:37.719
for five weeks of training

11:37.721 --> 11:40.314
under battle-conditioned
British commandos.

11:41.721 --> 11:42.935
I completed that training

11:42.937 --> 11:44.599
and officially
became a 29th Ranger,

11:44.601 --> 11:45.690
and returned to England.

11:46.777 --> 11:50.458
But I wanted to be reassigned
to a more elite unit.

11:51.226 --> 11:53.430
So I volunteered to
become a paratrooper

11:53.432 --> 11:55.863
with the 101st
Airborne Division.

11:55.865 --> 11:58.487
The buck sergeant of the
First Demolitions Section

11:58.489 --> 12:00.120
had heard that I'd
trained as a commando

12:00.122 --> 12:01.751
and had been a member
of the 29th Rangers,

12:01.753 --> 12:04.344
so he arranged to have
me assigned to them.

12:04.346 --> 12:07.706
Together we became
known as the Filthy 13.

12:08.889 --> 12:11.545
Our journey began when we were
stationed at a training camp

12:11.547 --> 12:15.322
in Essex, England in the
weeks leading up to D-Day.

12:24.090 --> 12:26.265
<i>McNasty was our buck sergeant.</i>

12:27.161 --> 12:28.824
<i>He wasn't a big guy in stature,</i>

12:28.826 --> 12:31.448
<i>but he was one of the
toughest men I've ever known.</i>

12:31.450 --> 12:34.585
<i>From day one, I knew I
wanted to be like this guy.</i>

12:34.587 --> 12:35.801
<i>Nothing fazed him.</i>

12:37.081 --> 12:38.905
<i>Agnew was second in command.</i>

12:39.834 --> 12:41.656
<i>He was a real bull.</i>

12:41.658 --> 12:44.984
<i>He was the best qualified
combat man I'd ever seen.</i>

12:44.986 --> 12:47.928
<i>He could fly a plane or
run any kind of boat.</i>

12:47.930 --> 12:51.223
<i>Frenchy was married, and had
a son before he signed up,</i>

12:51.225 --> 12:56.218
<i>so he had a sentimental side,
but he was one tough cookie.</i>

12:57.434 --> 13:01.178
<i>Chuck was a young kid, but
he was very hot-tempered.</i>

13:02.138 --> 13:04.217
<i>He was sent to our unit
because he was far too quick</i>

13:04.219 --> 13:06.682
<i>with his fists and no one
else could handle him.</i>

13:07.610 --> 13:11.610
<i>Piccadilly Willy, he
was a real ladies man.</i>

13:12.698 --> 13:15.320
<i>At that time, Piccadilly
Circus was a red light district</i>

13:15.322 --> 13:17.497
<i>in London, and he spent
all his spare time</i>

13:17.499 --> 13:20.376
<i>cruising for whores.</i>

13:20.378 --> 13:22.073
<i>Ragsman got his nickname</i>

13:22.075 --> 13:24.280
<i>because he never took
care of his clothes.</i>

13:24.282 --> 13:26.136
<i>I don't think he washed
his fatigues even once</i>

13:26.138 --> 13:27.514
<i>while we were in England.</i>

13:28.251 --> 13:30.137
<i>Goo-Goo was from
Joliet, Illinois.</i>

13:30.139 --> 13:31.992
<i>We were going out
through a pasture</i>

13:31.994 --> 13:34.905
<i>when Goo-Goo tripped and
fell onto a fresh cow patty.</i>

13:34.907 --> 13:36.184
<i>After he got up,</i>

13:36.186 --> 13:38.137
<i>he led the rest of the
column off at an angle.</i>

13:38.139 --> 13:40.889
<i>Later he said, "If you'd have
found that goo-goo like I did,</i>

13:40.891 --> 13:43.611
<i>"ain't no telling which
way you would have went."</i>

13:44.283 --> 13:46.171
<i>Dinty was a pretty quiet guy.</i>

13:47.354 --> 13:49.466
<i>But he surprised everyone
when he took McNasty to task</i>

13:49.468 --> 13:51.673
<i>for throwing a towel
of his in a stove.</i>

13:51.675 --> 13:53.209
<i>He never had much to say,</i>

13:53.211 --> 13:55.099
<i>but he earned the respect
of the men after that.</i>

13:55.771 --> 13:57.241
<i>Loulip was a big man,</i>

13:57.243 --> 13:58.841
<i>about six foot one
and real intelligent.</i>

13:58.843 --> 14:01.339
<i>He was so flat-footed
he walked like a duck.</i>

14:02.362 --> 14:04.153
<i>But boy, was he ahead
of everybody else</i>

14:04.155 --> 14:05.499
<i>on all things physical.</i>

14:06.396 --> 14:08.602
<i>Peepnuts had a voice
that was a bit squeaky.</i>

14:08.604 --> 14:11.481
<i>Just like a chicken,
peep peep peep.</i>

14:11.483 --> 14:14.458
<i>He was a little short, so the
other units didn't want him,</i>

14:14.460 --> 14:15.771
<i>but he had brass balls.</i>

14:17.084 --> 14:19.417
<i>Joey was a guy of
Polish descent.</i>

14:19.419 --> 14:21.530
<i>If you said you were gonna
charge into a building,</i>

14:21.532 --> 14:23.995
<i>he was right with you
every step of the way.</i>

14:25.211 --> 14:27.577
<i>Max was as tough as a boot,</i>

14:27.579 --> 14:30.554
<i>and one of the best football
players we had in the regiment.</i>

14:30.556 --> 14:32.378
<i>He would fight anything
that showed up,</i>

14:32.380 --> 14:34.172
<i>but he was never the instigator.</i>

14:35.292 --> 14:37.083
<i>Then of course, there was me.</i>

14:38.268 --> 14:41.274
<i>I was only 20, but once I
got something in my sights,</i>

14:41.276 --> 14:42.332
<i>I never missed.</i>

14:43.068 --> 14:45.339
<i>They used to say I had
the eyes of a hawk.</i>

14:56.508 --> 14:58.011
I think you should
be getting home.

15:00.444 --> 15:01.692
Okay, sure.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.757
But we can talk again, right?

15:10.172 --> 15:11.165
Sure.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.075
How about tomorrow?

15:15.196 --> 15:16.762
Alright.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.012
Bring a set of shears.

15:19.741 --> 15:20.891
Shears?

15:31.483 --> 15:32.828
How you doing?

15:33.532 --> 15:34.653
Good, thanks.

15:35.836 --> 15:38.204
Thought you might
like some cookies.

15:38.557 --> 15:39.804
Thank you.

15:43.645 --> 15:46.170
So had you had any more thoughts

15:46.172 --> 15:48.636
about what you wanna do
now that school's over?

15:50.173 --> 15:54.074
I'm still mulling
things over, you know?

15:54.076 --> 15:54.877
Yeah.

15:55.868 --> 15:58.362
Look, I know it must seem

15:58.364 --> 16:01.661
like there's a lot of pressure
right now to make a decision,

16:02.364 --> 16:04.634
but just remember this.

16:04.636 --> 16:07.035
Some of the most
successful people,

16:07.037 --> 16:08.603
they didn't know what
they wanted to do

16:08.605 --> 16:10.138
when they were your age.

16:10.140 --> 16:13.019
And some people, they
don't figure it out

16:13.021 --> 16:15.357
until much later in life.

16:16.541 --> 16:18.555
I don't think Dad would
agree with you on that one.

16:18.557 --> 16:20.091
Yeah.

16:20.093 --> 16:22.812
But Dad, he's worried.

16:22.814 --> 16:26.236
He sees a lot of kids lose
focus after they leave school.

16:27.132 --> 16:28.797
It's hard to find a job.

16:29.821 --> 16:32.989
Some become disillusioned,
and they get into trouble.

16:33.917 --> 16:36.158
You know he doesn't want
that to happen to you.

16:37.118 --> 16:37.918
It won't.

16:38.941 --> 16:39.742
I know.

16:41.821 --> 16:44.381
But you know, if
you wanna find out

16:45.277 --> 16:47.389
what the best path in life is,

16:48.540 --> 16:51.164
there's really only one
thing you need to figure out.

16:51.966 --> 16:52.830
And what's that?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.437
It's that one thing you feel
the most passionate about.

16:58.430 --> 17:01.470
The one thing that just
means the most to you.

17:02.206 --> 17:06.301
'Cause once you know that,
everything becomes clear.

17:08.765 --> 17:10.972
I'm sure I'll figure
it out eventually.

17:10.973 --> 17:12.477
Yeah, you will.

17:13.886 --> 17:14.654
Don't worry.

17:16.957 --> 17:18.238
See you later.

17:19.198 --> 17:20.989
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yep.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.462
Hello.

17:35.934 --> 17:37.726
<i>Hey Dad.</i>

17:38.814 --> 17:40.638
Anthony, is that you?

17:41.981 --> 17:43.550
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:44.510 --> 17:46.942
I haven't heard
from you in a while.

17:48.447 --> 17:52.926
<i>Yeah, sorry
about that, I've been busy.</i>

17:54.525 --> 17:55.998
What do you want?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.031
<i>I'm just calling
to see how you are.</i>

18:00.350 --> 18:01.789
Oh cut the crap, Anthony,

18:01.791 --> 18:03.807
I didn't come down with
yesterday's fall of shit.

18:07.647 --> 18:09.279
<i>Dad?</i>

18:10.814 --> 18:12.702
<i>They're gonna kill me.</i>

18:13.598 --> 18:15.071
How much is it this time?

18:16.766 --> 18:17.887
<i>Twenty thousand.</i>

18:20.766 --> 18:21.566
Jesus.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.764
<i>Fucking college basketball,</i>

18:24.766 --> 18:26.685
<i>some seven foot
motherfucker throws it in</i>

18:26.687 --> 18:29.855
<i>right in the buzzer, took my
fucking heart out of my chest.</i>

18:33.663 --> 18:35.452
What do you plan to do about it?

18:35.454 --> 18:37.596
<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>

18:37.598 --> 18:39.839
<i>Can you help me out at all?</i>

18:40.255 --> 18:42.013
You think I'd be living
in this shit hole

18:42.015 --> 18:44.444
if I had 20,000
under the mattress?

18:44.446 --> 18:45.759
Get real, son.

18:49.055 --> 18:50.366
<i>What about your medal?</i>

18:55.807 --> 18:56.862
My medal?

18:58.463 --> 19:00.925
<i>Bet we could get
a lot of money for that.</i>

19:03.583 --> 19:04.574
<i>Dad?</i>

19:05.248 --> 19:06.430
<i>Hello?</i>

19:37.792 --> 19:38.560
Hey kid.

19:39.840 --> 19:41.696
Take a load off, have a drink.

19:51.199 --> 19:55.264
So what do you
remember about D-Day?

19:56.383 --> 19:57.407
The silences.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.221
Silences?

20:00.223 --> 20:01.598
Yeah.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.031
Always in battle, there
are moments of silence.

20:05.120 --> 20:06.461
Guns and bombs going off,

20:06.463 --> 20:09.248
the goddamn noise makes
your goddamn ears bleed.

20:10.496 --> 20:13.182
But there are quiet
moments between all that.

20:13.184 --> 20:16.414
Everything would
suddenly fall silent.

20:16.416 --> 20:19.038
When the chaos rages,
you don't have to think.

20:19.040 --> 20:21.888
You're running on adrenaline
and survival instinct.

20:23.744 --> 20:27.905
But in those silent moments,

20:32.160 --> 20:34.687
all you can hear is
your own heartbeat.

20:37.728 --> 20:38.912
Your own breath.

20:45.121 --> 20:46.336
It's in those moments

20:49.824 --> 20:52.417
when you have time
to think about

20:54.817 --> 20:55.968
what's really at stake.

21:03.296 --> 21:05.118
Before we parachuted
into Normandy,

21:05.120 --> 21:07.328
we all painted our
faces with warpaint,

21:07.330 --> 21:08.576
like Native Americans.

21:09.472 --> 21:11.039
It was McNasty's idea.

21:11.041 --> 21:13.953
He had Native American blood
running through his veins.

21:38.529 --> 21:41.601
Take cover,
boys, krauts are coming.

22:28.129 --> 22:31.552
Alright, alright,
calm down, calm down!

22:31.554 --> 22:33.665
We're Americans,
you speak English?

22:33.667 --> 22:34.815
Yes, yes.

22:34.817 --> 22:36.257
Where'd you come from?

22:36.259 --> 22:38.719
The Nazi, they
destroy our village.

22:38.721 --> 22:40.736
They kill my wife,
don't hurt my daughter!

22:40.738 --> 22:42.240
We're not gonna hurt anyone.

22:42.242 --> 22:43.394
At ease, boys!

22:53.539 --> 22:54.338
Aggie!

22:59.427 --> 23:00.547
Any krauts follow you?

23:02.211 --> 23:05.473
I don't think so, but we've
been running for some time.

23:06.306 --> 23:08.834
Alright, alright.

23:10.147 --> 23:11.810
Come with us, you'll be safe.

23:14.306 --> 23:15.873
- No, no!
- Take cover!

23:17.379 --> 23:19.809
What the fuck, where the fuck is
that fire coming from?

23:19.811 --> 23:20.867
Ambush!

23:21.858 --> 23:23.104
He's up there!

23:23.106 --> 23:25.345
Stupid
fucker, he's up there!

23:25.347 --> 23:27.107
Frenchy, around
the fucking tree!

23:29.091 --> 23:31.553
Come on, run, come on!

23:31.555 --> 23:32.866
Taking fire!

23:34.179 --> 23:35.009
Motherfucker!

23:37.154 --> 23:38.689
Up in the tree, take him out!

23:40.707 --> 23:42.337
Take him out!

23:48.579 --> 23:49.696
Max!

23:49.698 --> 23:51.618
Fuck! Fuck you!

23:57.155 --> 23:58.368
Max, get up here!

23:58.370 --> 24:01.283
- Max, come up!
- Fuck you, fucking...!

24:01.699 --> 24:03.841
Fuck, oh fuck.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.603
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

24:07.267 --> 24:09.089
Sorry, I'm jammed!

24:09.091 --> 24:11.841
Keep firing,
kill that motherfucker!

24:11.843 --> 24:14.370
Fuck you, fuck you!

24:14.372 --> 24:15.297
I'm gonna kill you!

24:15.299 --> 24:16.608
No!

24:16.610 --> 24:18.243
God damn it, I'm
trying to help you!

24:19.172 --> 24:21.891
Papa, Papa, no.

24:26.147 --> 24:28.737
Alright, it's your
moment, Hawkeye.

24:58.819 --> 25:00.578
Can anybody help, please?

25:00.580 --> 25:02.435
He's gone, honey.

25:02.437 --> 25:03.811
- He's gone.
- Papa.

25:05.349 --> 25:07.617
Can anybody help, please?

25:14.244 --> 25:15.586
Can anybody help?

25:15.588 --> 25:16.867
You gotta let him go.

25:16.869 --> 25:17.860
No, no.

25:18.757 --> 25:20.897
No, no, no, no, no!

25:20.899 --> 25:22.530
- You gotta let him go.
- No!

25:22.532 --> 25:23.618
Let him go.

25:23.620 --> 25:25.346
Gotta let him go, come on.

25:25.348 --> 25:28.484
Let him go, there's
nothing you can do for him.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.373
No!

25:51.237 --> 25:54.946
That's what it's like
on the battlefield.

25:54.948 --> 25:56.772
Everything can
change in a moment.

25:58.468 --> 26:01.412
On the one hand, you're
relieved to have survived.

26:02.724 --> 26:07.138
But sometimes, you wish
you didn't have to live on

26:07.140 --> 26:08.292
with those memories.

26:09.541 --> 26:10.820
I feel like an idiot.

26:11.493 --> 26:12.389
Why?

26:13.061 --> 26:14.885
I shouldn't be asking
you to relive all this.

26:15.109 --> 26:17.570
Well, at least someone still
cares about what we did,

26:17.572 --> 26:18.786
'cause I gotta tell you, kid,

26:18.788 --> 26:20.483
it doesn't take long
to be forgotten.

26:20.485 --> 26:24.099
Hell, we were forgotten when
the war was still going on.

26:24.101 --> 26:26.627
We'd lost contact with
our commanding officers.

26:26.629 --> 26:28.261
They assumed we were all dead.

26:29.605 --> 26:32.645
We were stranded in rural
Normandy without any support.

26:34.661 --> 26:36.772
Was the girl still with you?

26:37.222 --> 26:38.278
No.

26:38.469 --> 26:40.867
We dropped her off at a
hospital in a nearby town

26:40.869 --> 26:42.310
the day after her father died.

26:43.238 --> 26:46.118
The day after that,
we took a wrong turn.

26:47.525 --> 26:49.187
Later that week, we lost contact

26:49.189 --> 26:50.531
with our commanding officers

26:50.533 --> 26:53.221
and walked around
for a couple of days.

26:54.309 --> 26:56.003
We kept our wits
about us, but hell,

26:56.005 --> 26:58.021
even the Germans
weren't out that far.

26:58.949 --> 27:01.765
All we ran into were
fields and woodlands.

27:03.205 --> 27:06.307
And then one day, we
happened upon this cabin

27:06.309 --> 27:08.003
in the middle of nowhere.

28:31.463 --> 28:33.925
Go, go,
go, go, go, go!

28:33.927 --> 28:35.045
- Don't move!
- Get the fuck in there!

28:35.047 --> 28:36.101
- Get the fuck in there!
- Clear!

28:36.103 --> 28:37.349
- Don't move!
- You hear?

28:37.351 --> 28:38.213
I don't give a fuck
what you are!

28:38.215 --> 28:39.046
Clear!

28:39.048 --> 28:39.941
I'll blow your fucking head off!

28:39.943 --> 28:41.221
I don't give a fuck!

28:41.223 --> 28:42.757
Alright.

28:42.759 --> 28:43.943
You speak English?

28:45.127 --> 28:46.149
Yes, yes.

28:46.151 --> 28:47.269
What's your name?

28:47.271 --> 28:48.262
Arthur.

28:49.191 --> 28:50.662
This is my wife, Andrea,

28:50.664 --> 28:53.319
and these are my children,
Raphael and Marianne.

28:53.990 --> 28:55.077
Family name?

28:55.079 --> 28:56.389
Dubois.

28:56.391 --> 28:58.341
You all French, born and bred?

28:58.343 --> 28:59.143
Yes.

29:00.263 --> 29:03.716
I was born in Paris, and
my wife in Strasbourg.

29:03.718 --> 29:05.959
We settled here in
Normandy after marrying.

29:07.175 --> 29:08.519
Our children were born here.

29:09.286 --> 29:10.469
Alright.

29:10.471 --> 29:11.941
Frenchy, do a sweep upstairs,

29:11.943 --> 29:13.349
make sure there's no
unwanted house guests here.

29:13.351 --> 29:14.118
You got it.

29:14.727 --> 29:16.678
I think all the unwanted
guests are right here.

29:16.680 --> 29:17.830
Hey!

29:17.832 --> 29:19.909
Let's keep it friendly here.

29:19.911 --> 29:21.925
We're not gonna hurt anyone.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.550
We're Americans, here to
fight the Nazi bastards

29:24.552 --> 29:25.925
occupying your country.

29:25.927 --> 29:27.464
We're on the same side.

29:28.935 --> 29:32.742
I understand, but
please, this is my home.

29:32.744 --> 29:34.085
It would be disrespectful

29:34.087 --> 29:35.176
to go searching through
my family's belongings.

29:35.495 --> 29:37.253
They won't be doing that.

29:37.255 --> 29:39.624
It's standard procedure
to check the premises.

29:42.887 --> 29:43.847
<i>Oui.</i>

29:45.095 --> 29:47.078
Aggie, Hawkeye, do
another sweep around here.

29:47.080 --> 29:49.224
- Yes, sir.
- Yep, we're on it.

30:04.584 --> 30:07.432
You wouldn't have any
tobacco, would you?

30:13.577 --> 30:14.568
No.

30:15.304 --> 30:16.615
I do not smoke, no.

30:37.640 --> 30:39.431
I can assure you, Mrs. Dubois,

30:39.433 --> 30:43.495
that the last thing we wanna
do is frighten your family.

30:45.961 --> 30:48.391
Me and my boys have been
walking here for days,

30:48.393 --> 30:50.919
and we haven't had
any food or water,

30:50.921 --> 30:54.825
so this meal is very
much appreciated.

30:57.992 --> 31:00.201
And then after the
meal, you will leave?

31:00.936 --> 31:02.152
Yeah, of course.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.897
Always checking that
time, Hawkeye, huh?

31:15.625 --> 31:18.312
This is the best damn
food I ever tasted.

31:19.785 --> 31:21.480
You fucking moron.

31:21.482 --> 31:26.215
You know, apart from some
gone-off half of a can of

31:26.217 --> 31:29.991
cheese, this is the only fucking
food that we've had in a week.

31:29.993 --> 31:32.938
Of course it's the best fucking
thing you've ever eaten.

31:33.576 --> 31:34.631
Fuck you, Willy.

31:34.633 --> 31:36.329
No, fuck you, you fuck.

31:46.313 --> 31:49.514
You should relax,
we'll be gone soon.

31:50.473 --> 31:54.026
I'm sorry, but
we are not used to visitors.

31:54.665 --> 31:57.162
We haven't had house
guests for many months now.

31:58.698 --> 32:01.929
Hey Arthur, see
that guy over there?

32:02.954 --> 32:03.978
His name is Frenchy.

32:05.738 --> 32:06.633
You speak French?

32:07.593 --> 32:08.937
No, no sir.

32:09.801 --> 32:12.647
I was born in Quebec,
it's in Canada.

32:12.649 --> 32:15.336
They speak French over there,
but my folks moved back

32:15.338 --> 32:17.770
to the States when I was
like two weeks old, so...

32:18.346 --> 32:20.937
So not the most appropriate
of nicknames, no?

32:21.801 --> 32:23.495
No, I suppose not.

32:23.497 --> 32:25.319
Still, could be worse.

32:25.321 --> 32:26.890
Could be called
Piccadilly Willy.

32:27.274 --> 32:28.969
Why do they call you that?

32:30.057 --> 32:31.656
I'll tell you, alright?

32:31.658 --> 32:33.577
You know Piccadilly train
station, you got these trains,

32:33.579 --> 32:36.679
they going in every fucking
half an hour, all the time.

32:36.681 --> 32:38.984
Now my own particular
love carriage.

32:38.986 --> 32:40.328
- Willy, that's enough!
- It's the biggest

32:40.330 --> 32:42.216
fucking thing you've
ever seen in your life!

32:42.218 --> 32:43.273
I'm telling you, I mean...

32:43.275 --> 32:44.457
Willy, that's enough.

32:44.650 --> 32:46.024
What the fuck are
you saying to me?

32:46.026 --> 32:47.848
What, you trying to tell
me that this kid here,

32:47.850 --> 32:50.665
he doesn't understand what
the fuck we're talking about?

32:50.667 --> 32:53.416
I lost my virginity
when I was fucking nine!

32:53.418 --> 32:54.250
What?

32:54.538 --> 32:56.232
I know what you're
talking about.

32:56.234 --> 32:58.344
You like the whore, yes?

33:07.243 --> 33:09.098
Smart kid you got there, Arthur.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.338
He should mind his manners.

33:11.754 --> 33:14.090
Give him a
break, he's just a kid.

33:20.427 --> 33:21.707
That's
a nice painting.

33:22.410 --> 33:26.155
No, It's a copy,
so not worth much.

33:26.762 --> 33:28.843
It's called "The
Lady in the Field."

33:29.738 --> 33:31.210
Not very imaginative.

33:31.723 --> 33:34.156
Just looks like a
say-what-you-see title.

33:35.306 --> 33:38.666
If it was an original, it
would be worth a lot of money.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.491
Monet is a very famous artist.

33:41.739 --> 33:42.954
I never heard of him.

33:43.659 --> 33:46.441
Someone said the same
thing to me yesterday.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.746
I guess not everyone
has an eye for art.

33:54.955 --> 33:56.811
You had a visitor yesterday?

33:59.147 --> 34:00.140
What?

34:00.971 --> 34:03.402
You said you had a
visitor yesterday.

34:06.187 --> 34:08.875
Yes, a friend of mine visited.

34:11.339 --> 34:12.139
That's odd.

34:14.155 --> 34:14.954
What?

34:16.108 --> 34:18.922
You said you hadn't had
visitors for months.

34:21.164 --> 34:22.221
So what of it?

34:22.635 --> 34:24.553
It's no big thing.

34:24.554 --> 34:25.929
Just seems strange to say

34:25.931 --> 34:27.594
you didn't have house
guests for months,

34:27.596 --> 34:30.284
and then say someone visited
your house yesterday.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.458
I am just nervous, okay?

34:32.460 --> 34:34.540
It's not every day you have
armed men burst into your home.

34:34.763 --> 34:36.683
Why you getting
so worked up, Art?

34:37.931 --> 34:39.052
What's the problem?

34:43.147 --> 34:44.266
Is there a problem?

34:45.804 --> 34:47.915
I don't understand what
the relevance of this is.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.891
Well in our line of work,

34:52.235 --> 34:54.570
someone lies about
a little thing,

34:54.572 --> 34:57.803
you begin to wonder, can they
lie about a bigger thing, too?

34:58.540 --> 34:59.979
What do you mean?

35:01.068 --> 35:02.665
Well, I'm beginning to wonder

35:02.667 --> 35:06.220
if all this fear and nervousness
your family is showing is...

35:07.692 --> 35:09.196
Is it only about us?

35:12.364 --> 35:13.674
What, you think a
bunch of Americans

35:13.676 --> 35:15.244
with guns isn't scary enough?

35:16.139 --> 35:18.090
Well, some people think
being a soldier

35:18.092 --> 35:20.619
is all about force
and endurance.

35:20.621 --> 35:21.420
It ain't.

35:22.572 --> 35:24.554
It's about having
the instinct to know

35:24.556 --> 35:25.868
when something ain't right.

35:28.237 --> 35:30.572
That way, you can
spot an ambush.

35:34.379 --> 35:35.980
We are just a
normal family here.

35:36.716 --> 35:38.250
We don't support the Germans.

35:38.252 --> 35:39.564
I'm not saying you do.

35:40.588 --> 35:43.821
But do I know all there
is to know here, Arthur?

36:45.806 --> 36:47.435
- What the...
- Get into the walls!

36:47.437 --> 36:48.811
- What the fuck!
- All in the walls!

36:48.813 --> 36:51.020
Open up, open up, boys!

36:53.645 --> 36:56.363
Open up, open up, open up!

36:58.574 --> 37:00.235
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

37:00.237 --> 37:02.507
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

37:02.509 --> 37:04.877
Fuck you, fuck you!

37:19.918 --> 37:21.391
Mother fucker.

37:58.254 --> 37:59.887
Ow!

38:16.334 --> 38:17.134
Good shot.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.678
Let's finish him off.

38:43.855 --> 38:45.200
<i>Fick dich Amerikaner!</i>

38:45.615 --> 38:46.540
What'd he say?

38:46.542 --> 38:47.791
Something about dick.

38:48.111 --> 38:51.180
Yeah, I think he wants
to play with our dicks

38:51.182 --> 38:52.239
if we let him go.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.711
Fucking American perverts.

38:53.903 --> 38:56.399
So you
<i>Sprechen</i> English, huh?

38:57.263 --> 38:59.438
You wouldn't
happen to have any tobacco,

38:59.440 --> 39:00.400
by any chance?

39:03.023 --> 39:05.517
Nah, didn't think
you'd understand that.

39:05.519 --> 39:07.181
Let's see if you
understand this.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.855
You know, I don't think
that got the point across.

39:12.302 --> 39:14.029
Let's try this.

39:22.352 --> 39:25.552
Want me to put him
out of his misery?

39:26.192 --> 39:30.095
Nah, let him take
the long way out.

39:31.727 --> 39:33.872
Fucking bastards, kill me.

39:35.120 --> 39:36.112
Kill me now.

39:37.936 --> 39:42.254
When you get to Hell, tell
them the Filthy 13 sent you.

40:01.263 --> 40:02.639
You lost so many.

40:02.865 --> 40:03.825
Yeah.

40:04.497 --> 40:06.031
A lot of our men were killed.

40:07.216 --> 40:08.720
We killed a lot of men, too.

40:10.288 --> 40:11.568
What's it like?

40:12.496 --> 40:13.423
To kill a man?

40:13.425 --> 40:14.288
Yeah.

40:14.832 --> 40:16.687
It's goddamn awful,
that's what it is.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.878
The only thing worse is to
be given a medal for it.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.670
It doesn't matter that the enemy

40:22.672 --> 40:24.496
has a different
ideology from you.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.432
If you've got any kind of
soul, it's gonna affect you.

40:29.457 --> 40:31.887
Truth is, we're not
all that different.

40:33.233 --> 40:34.765
Doesn't matter what country
you're fighting for,

40:34.767 --> 40:36.558
we were all just
following orders,

40:36.560 --> 40:39.760
trying to put food on the table
for our families back home.

40:43.056 --> 40:45.039
This is the first time
I've talked about this

40:45.041 --> 40:46.001
in quite a while.

40:49.073 --> 40:52.783
But there isn't a day goes
by I don't think about it.

40:54.737 --> 40:58.609
Sometimes at night,
I close my eyes.

41:02.864 --> 41:04.848
I relive those moments
on the battlefield.

41:09.937 --> 41:11.153
They haunt me.

41:24.337 --> 41:26.031
<i>All the
news have been pouring in</i>

41:26.033 --> 41:28.975
<i>from Berlin, claiming
that D-Day is here.</i>

41:28.977 --> 41:30.575
It's an outrage
there's no support

41:30.577 --> 41:32.050
for these guys after the war.

41:33.106 --> 41:34.033
Time marches on.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.585
The world changes,
people forget.

41:38.578 --> 41:40.305
It's a tragedy, is what it is.

41:41.297 --> 41:43.247
You know, someone
should write a book

41:43.249 --> 41:44.881
about what those guys did.

41:45.872 --> 41:47.506
Why don't you?

41:50.098 --> 41:52.209
English lit was
never my speciality.

41:52.402 --> 41:54.288
Don't put yourself down.

41:54.290 --> 41:56.431
I read some of those stories
you wrote when you were a kid,

41:56.433 --> 41:57.714
they were really descriptive.

41:58.353 --> 42:01.137
That was years ago, how the
hell did you read those?

42:01.554 --> 42:02.897
Your mother showed me.

42:03.857 --> 42:05.487
She kept them all.

42:05.489 --> 42:08.945
She's got a whole box of short
stories you scribbled down.

42:10.001 --> 42:11.602
I never even know
she kept those.

42:12.274 --> 42:15.377
Maybe you should read them
again, might inspire you.

42:16.306 --> 42:18.671
They might remind
you of who you were

42:18.673 --> 42:20.978
before the world told
you who you should be.

42:22.131 --> 42:23.313
That's pretty deep.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.840
You're wondering about
what you're gonna do

42:25.842 --> 42:26.610
with your life.

42:27.378 --> 42:30.450
That's a deep question,
it needs a deep answer.

42:32.658 --> 42:33.458
True.

42:34.451 --> 42:36.847
You know, if you think about
the reasons we cross paths

42:36.849 --> 42:40.368
with people, maybe that's why
Hawkeye's come into your life.

42:40.370 --> 42:42.000
Not because you're
meant to be a soldier,

42:42.002 --> 42:44.209
but because you're meant
to write about one,

42:44.211 --> 42:45.875
make sure he's remembered.

42:48.051 --> 42:49.042
Do you wanna meet him?

42:52.690 --> 42:54.512
So there's me
thinking peewee here

42:54.514 --> 42:56.818
has no direction in his
life, and he brings you here.

42:57.458 --> 43:00.467
I guess he's
made at least one decision.

43:01.427 --> 43:03.120
I guess so.

43:03.122 --> 43:06.546
So how did you manage to
snag a classy girl like this?

43:07.506 --> 43:08.850
I have my moments.

43:10.003 --> 43:11.793
What was your first
date like, hon?

43:11.795 --> 43:13.553
I'm guessing you wouldn't
have been too impressed

43:13.555 --> 43:15.411
with cheeseburgers at
the local bowling alley.

43:16.531 --> 43:18.930
It was actually pretty amazing.

43:19.828 --> 43:24.371
I love stars, but in the city,
bright ones are hard to find.

43:25.107 --> 43:27.793
Chris knew there'd be load
shedding in his friend's area.

43:27.795 --> 43:29.840
You know, where the
government cuts electricity

43:29.842 --> 43:31.953
in scheduled districts
to conserve energy.

43:31.955 --> 43:33.137
Right.

43:33.139 --> 43:36.240
So Chris set up a date
on his friend's roof

43:36.242 --> 43:37.651
in one of those areas.

43:38.707 --> 43:42.417
He laid blankets,
bought champagne and

43:42.419 --> 43:47.410
my favorite flowers. After about
10 minutes, the power was cut

43:47.412 --> 43:50.864
and the sky lit up,

43:50.866 --> 43:52.177
and we spent the whole night

43:52.179 --> 43:54.579
drinking champagne
and stargazing.

43:57.011 --> 44:00.723
He knew my brother Alan
had died the year before,

44:01.716 --> 44:04.881
and I also told him I
believe people become stars

44:04.883 --> 44:06.418
when they die.

44:06.420 --> 44:09.777
And at the end of the date,
Chris pointed out a star

44:09.779 --> 44:13.299
and told me he'd registered
it online as Alan.

44:14.292 --> 44:15.412
Named after my brother.

44:17.139 --> 44:18.545
He gave me a certificate
and everything,

44:18.547 --> 44:19.923
it was all official.

44:21.843 --> 44:25.264
Pretty thoughtful of you
there, kid, I'll give you that.

44:25.266 --> 44:27.251
I'm sorry to hear
about your brother.

44:27.795 --> 44:28.852
Thank you.

44:29.779 --> 44:33.009
I lost my wife Theresa
a couple years back.

44:33.011 --> 44:35.412
Our first date was not
as spectacular as that.

44:36.243 --> 44:37.873
I just took her to a dance,

44:37.875 --> 44:39.956
that's how people courted
each other back in '41.

44:40.980 --> 44:42.513
The setting wasn't spectacular,

44:42.515 --> 44:46.099
but boy, was she a
spectacular woman.

44:47.444 --> 44:49.746
All Theresa had to
do was smile at me,

44:49.748 --> 44:51.637
and everything in
life made sense.

44:52.660 --> 44:55.540
She wrote to me every
day while I was away.

44:56.116 --> 44:58.898
Throughout the training,
throughout the war.

44:58.900 --> 45:00.402
I didn't get all the
letters, of course,

45:00.404 --> 45:01.651
but still, she wrote.

45:02.196 --> 45:04.469
Did you marry before
the war or after?

45:04.659 --> 45:06.132
After, '49.

45:07.188 --> 45:08.692
Best decision I ever made.

45:10.196 --> 45:12.850
I bet she didn't want
you to fight, did she?

45:12.852 --> 45:13.620
No, she didn't.

45:14.548 --> 45:16.113
But she knew it was
something I had to do,

45:16.115 --> 45:17.298
it's the way I was made.

45:17.300 --> 45:18.452
So she accepted it.

45:20.181 --> 45:21.202
Chris said you received a medal

45:21.204 --> 45:22.962
for what you did during war.

45:22.964 --> 45:23.956
Medal of Honor.

45:25.012 --> 45:26.451
It's the highest award

45:26.453 --> 45:28.309
the United States can give
its military personnel.

45:28.852 --> 45:30.513
Would you like to see it?

45:30.515 --> 45:31.668
Of course.

45:42.067 --> 45:44.660
Wow, it's beautiful.

45:45.268 --> 45:48.531
Did you get this for
taking out the sniper,

45:48.533 --> 45:50.740
or the Nazi at the cabin?

45:50.932 --> 45:54.357
No, that was for something else.

47:05.141 --> 47:07.188
<i>After
D-Day, McNasty, Agnew, and I</i>

47:07.190 --> 47:09.972
<i>ended up in a hospital on
the outskirts of Normandy.</i>

47:09.974 --> 47:11.796
<i>We'd finally been
found by Allied forces</i>

47:11.798 --> 47:14.099
<i>after over a week
in the wilderness.</i>

47:14.101 --> 47:16.885
<i>It had pretty much been turned
into a military hospital.</i>

47:16.887 --> 47:19.220
<i>They were mainly treating
US and British soldiers</i>

47:19.222 --> 47:20.566
<i>who were wounded or ill.</i>

47:24.278 --> 47:25.492
You know
what I could go for

47:25.494 --> 47:26.965
right about now, boys?

47:27.221 --> 47:28.275
What's that, man?

47:28.277 --> 47:29.749
American-style hotdog.

47:31.158 --> 47:33.973
Stuck here with all these
lazies talking about sausage.

47:35.126 --> 47:37.623
Who you writing a letter
to, your boyfriend?

47:39.510 --> 47:40.310
<i>Touché.</i>

47:41.494 --> 47:42.548
What's his name?

47:42.550 --> 47:43.510
Marlene.

47:44.342 --> 47:45.909
Marlene.

47:46.582 --> 47:48.052
Marlene.

47:48.054 --> 47:50.006
Yeah, he sounds real pretty.

47:50.902 --> 47:53.524
Hey man, I like a bit
of hair, you know?

47:53.526 --> 47:54.806
I bet you do.

47:56.151 --> 47:58.005
Well don't worry, boys.

47:58.007 --> 48:00.980
We get back to England,
I'll take you to my cabin.

48:00.982 --> 48:02.644
Jake's Bar and Grill.

48:02.646 --> 48:06.612
I'll get you deer
and rabbit, fish.

48:06.614 --> 48:09.461
I remember a story, I
went fishing one night.

48:09.463 --> 48:12.436
Came back, threw the
fish underneath the bed.

48:12.438 --> 48:14.229
Lord Willis' estate.

48:14.231 --> 48:17.685
Had just come in the door, and
who's knocking at the door?

48:17.687 --> 48:18.868
Only Leach.

48:18.870 --> 48:20.404
Fucking hate that guy.

48:20.406 --> 48:21.748
Major asshole.

48:21.750 --> 48:23.414
He went from sergeant
to Major Asshole.

48:23.671 --> 48:25.428
'Cause they always
promote the assholes.

48:25.430 --> 48:27.444
- Yeah.
- Damn right, damn right.

48:27.446 --> 48:30.517
Anyway, Leach is shouting at me,

48:30.519 --> 48:34.581
and he say, "McNise, McNise,
have you been stealing fish?"

48:34.583 --> 48:37.109
I says oh, no sir, no sir.

48:37.111 --> 48:39.157
Meantime, all the
fish are flopping

48:39.159 --> 48:43.125
and flapping underneath the
bed, having a goddamn orgy.

48:43.127 --> 48:46.292
And I'm standing
there "no sir, no way,

48:46.294 --> 48:47.508
I ain't got all them fish out."

48:47.510 --> 48:48.821
-Did he catch you?

48:48.823 --> 48:49.974
No, he just left.

48:49.976 --> 48:53.493
Said the place smelled
like a city dump.

48:53.495 --> 48:56.694
Hell.

48:56.696 --> 48:58.517
Beer and deer, boys.

48:58.519 --> 48:59.576
Beer and deer, man, amen.

49:00.055 --> 49:01.176
That sounds good.

49:10.007 --> 49:14.837
One American soldier positioned
at the entrance, armed.

49:14.839 --> 49:17.845
That must mean there are
other American soldiers

49:17.847 --> 49:19.574
recovering inside.

49:19.576 --> 49:22.871
Possibly British and
other Allied forces, too.

49:23.576 --> 49:25.366
Should we call in a air strike?

49:25.368 --> 49:27.190
There has been no
radio response,

49:27.192 --> 49:29.463
we will have to
take them ourselves.

49:30.328 --> 49:32.311
How do you propose we proceed?

49:33.399 --> 49:34.869
With stealth.

49:34.871 --> 49:36.982
Our first target will be
the soldier positioned

49:36.984 --> 49:37.944
at the entrance.

49:38.648 --> 49:41.077
But we need to ensure we
don't alert those inside

49:41.079 --> 49:42.581
to our presence.

49:42.583 --> 49:45.718
Guns are out of the
question at this stage.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.895
We need to employ other means.

49:49.175 --> 49:50.168
Understood.

50:58.744 --> 51:01.527
Excuse me, Doctor, I'm
really sorry to disturb you,

51:01.529 --> 51:04.183
but I need to move the beds
from ward two to ward four,

51:04.185 --> 51:06.391
and I also need to
administer the penicillin,

51:06.393 --> 51:07.446
so I'd really like...

51:07.448 --> 51:08.919
Nobody needs to move anywhere,

51:08.921 --> 51:10.583
there's a complete backlog
of prescriptions here.

51:10.585 --> 51:11.991
I understand what you're
saying, but I could really...

51:11.993 --> 51:13.369
Not at the moment, Nurse.

51:16.120 --> 51:16.921
Nurse.

51:17.721 --> 51:19.990
Can you take this
down to ward six?

51:19.992 --> 51:21.145
That'll be all.

53:42.395 --> 53:43.705
- Kill them!
- Aggie!

55:35.772 --> 55:37.947
Say goodnight, you
son of a bitch.

55:45.693 --> 55:46.685
Shit.

55:47.484 --> 55:51.229
I forgot to ask him
if he has any tobacco.

56:32.765 --> 56:34.235
Put the gun down.

56:34.237 --> 56:36.571
Fancy your
chances of killing us both?

56:36.573 --> 56:37.596
Are you really that fast?

56:37.598 --> 56:38.845
Fuck you.

56:39.101 --> 56:41.467
Even if you were fast
enough to take us both out,

56:41.469 --> 56:43.387
how far could you really get?

56:43.389 --> 56:45.243
The allies are all
over this town,

56:45.245 --> 56:48.379
you're not gonna get far without
running into one of them.

56:48.381 --> 56:51.131
Put that gun down
or I will kill her!

56:51.133 --> 56:53.307
Let the girl go.

56:53.309 --> 56:55.963
This isn't her
war, this is ours.

56:55.965 --> 56:58.300
So let's settle it, you and me.

56:58.302 --> 57:01.852
Drop the fucking gun,
I will kill her dead.

57:01.854 --> 57:04.444
Come on, let her go.

57:04.446 --> 57:06.619
I'm going to count to three.

57:06.621 --> 57:09.180
If you don't throw
your gun to the floor,

57:09.182 --> 57:11.102
I'll fucking kill her!

57:12.094 --> 57:13.085
One.

57:17.854 --> 57:18.654
Two.

57:22.238 --> 57:23.164
Three.

58:10.719 --> 58:11.679
Yeah.

58:21.470 --> 58:22.687
Beer and deer, boys?

58:23.999 --> 58:25.277
Beer and deer.

58:25.471 --> 58:28.031
Yeah, beer and deer.

59:16.287 --> 59:17.822
Some soldiers only feel alive

59:17.824 --> 59:20.381
when they're on the battlefield.

59:20.383 --> 59:22.527
I never got a buzz
from the things I did.

59:23.296 --> 59:24.733
Even when they gave
me a medal for it,

59:24.735 --> 59:26.560
I felt no sense of satisfaction.

59:27.582 --> 59:28.768
This is the truth.

59:29.792 --> 59:31.326
The only time I ever felt alive

59:31.328 --> 59:33.120
was when Theresa was by my side.

59:33.855 --> 59:35.840
Every moment with
her was a gift.

59:38.111 --> 59:40.093
Thank you for sharing with us.

59:40.095 --> 59:41.982
I know it must be so difficult.

59:43.551 --> 59:46.143
I'm so honored you've
told me all this, sir.

59:46.783 --> 59:48.320
It really means a lot to me.

59:50.687 --> 59:52.126
Well if you only
remember one thing

59:52.128 --> 59:55.040
from the things I've
told you, let it be this.

59:56.031 --> 59:58.014
No one ever laid
on their deathbed

59:58.016 --> 01:00:00.800
wishing they'd spent more
time on the battlefield.

01:00:01.535 --> 01:00:03.422
The only thing a man on
his deathbed thinks about

01:00:03.424 --> 01:00:08.032
are those he loved and
those who loved him back.

01:00:19.488 --> 01:00:20.448
Hey.

01:00:22.016 --> 01:00:22.784
Hey.

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.912
Heard you went down to
the recruitment office.

01:00:28.609 --> 01:00:29.409
Yeah.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:31.552
How'd it go?

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.977
Not so good, actually.

01:00:36.641 --> 01:00:38.717
Yeah, that's kinda
what I figured.

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:43.936
Listen, Dad, I'm sorry,
okay, but...

01:00:45.537 --> 01:00:47.328
I don't wanna
go in the Army.

01:00:48.288 --> 01:00:49.696
It's okay to be scared.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:51.809
It's not that.

01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:54.943
There's another reason
I don't wanna do it.

01:00:56.353 --> 01:00:57.120
Which is?

01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.346
It's Jessica, Dad.

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:03.265
I love her.

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:08.865
Every moment we have together
is like a gift, you know?

01:01:20.832 --> 01:01:25.953
There's something I
never really told anyone,

01:01:27.584 --> 01:01:29.024
not even your mom
for a long time.

01:01:29.026 --> 01:01:29.954
And what's that?

01:01:31.073 --> 01:01:35.551
You know how I
couldn't join the Army

01:01:35.553 --> 01:01:38.816
because I had hurt my
leg playing football?

01:01:38.818 --> 01:01:39.617
Sure.

01:01:44.194 --> 01:01:46.881
I kinda faked it.

01:01:49.474 --> 01:01:50.498
You faked it?

01:01:52.065 --> 01:01:55.393
Kinda, not really, I
just, it's complicated.

01:01:59.554 --> 01:02:01.857
I really did wanna
join the Army.

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:04.640
But the week I was supposed
to go and do my medical,

01:02:04.642 --> 01:02:06.658
I found out your
mom was pregnant.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.682
So I had a choice.

01:02:13.346 --> 01:02:16.354
And after thinking about it,
there really wasn't a choice.

01:02:17.314 --> 01:02:19.618
Family was gonna win
out, no matter what.

01:02:22.466 --> 01:02:23.936
There's no way I was
gonna leave her here

01:02:23.938 --> 01:02:25.600
to raise you by herself,

01:02:25.602 --> 01:02:28.417
and the thought of leaving
you alone for months on end?

01:02:30.723 --> 01:02:32.033
Just knew I couldn't do it.

01:02:32.929 --> 01:02:34.528
Really?

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:35.330
Yeah.

01:02:39.138 --> 01:02:39.937
Sorry.

01:02:42.339 --> 01:02:44.000
I've been a total jerk, man,

01:02:44.002 --> 01:02:46.465
I shouldn't have been pushing
you so hard to join the Army.

01:02:47.298 --> 01:02:48.512
It's alright, Dad.

01:02:48.514 --> 01:02:50.274
No, no, it's not.

01:02:52.066 --> 01:02:54.785
I've just been scared that
you'd turn into some gangbanger,

01:02:54.787 --> 01:02:59.425
or become one of those kids
with no direction in their life.

01:02:59.427 --> 01:03:01.794
I know you're too
smart for that.

01:03:03.106 --> 01:03:06.401
But still, you know, your mom,

01:03:06.403 --> 01:03:10.145
she helped me see
that I was just

01:03:10.147 --> 01:03:12.705
really projecting my
own fears onto you,

01:03:12.707 --> 01:03:15.491
and so I'm sorry for that.

01:03:17.154 --> 01:03:19.490
You never have to
apologize for caring.

01:03:24.195 --> 01:03:27.361
Take one small piece of
advice from me, though?

01:03:27.363 --> 01:03:28.163
Of course.

01:03:29.635 --> 01:03:31.108
Being in love is great.

01:03:32.899 --> 01:03:35.587
You and Jessica, you're
really meant to be together.

01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:38.689
Whatever hopes and
dreams you have

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.763
should really fit into your
lives as a couple, you know?

01:03:42.755 --> 01:03:47.139
You know, I didn't really know
what I wanted to do.

01:03:47.778 --> 01:03:50.337
But this, these past few weeks,

01:03:50.339 --> 01:03:54.210
it's become clear to
me what I have to do.

01:04:13.188 --> 01:04:13.956
Hawkeye?

01:04:16.388 --> 01:04:17.379
Hawkeye?

01:04:27.715 --> 01:04:28.771
Wake up, sir.

01:06:01.093 --> 01:06:02.086
Death.

01:06:06.692 --> 01:06:07.940
Death is the road.

01:06:10.469 --> 01:06:12.293
Life is the path.

01:06:13.957 --> 01:06:16.901
The soul is the guide.

01:06:18.949 --> 01:06:23.941
Now the brain thinks of death,
the heart thinks of life.

01:06:26.694 --> 01:06:27.557
But the soul?

01:06:31.813 --> 01:06:33.605
The soul thinks of eternity.

01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:40.262
You should know,

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:44.613
he adjusted his will in
the final week of his life.

01:06:46.053 --> 01:06:50.086
This next and final reading
contains that very amendment.

01:06:53.766 --> 01:06:55.268
"I leave my Medal of Honor

01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:57.828
"to my friend,
Christopher Summerbee."

01:07:00.742 --> 01:07:02.275
"I leave this medal to him,

01:07:02.277 --> 01:07:05.286
"because he knows the
true meaning of bravery."

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:09.030
"Not just because
he saved my life,

01:07:10.246 --> 01:07:14.087
"but because he is brave enough
to take his own path in life,

01:07:15.077 --> 01:07:16.358
"and be true to himself."

01:07:24.486 --> 01:07:27.110
I'll give you a
moment, Mr. Summerbee.

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:28.742
Thank you.

01:08:51.783 --> 01:08:54.277
<i>I wish
that Franklin D. Roosevelt</i>

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.456
<i>had lived to see this day.</i>

01:08:58.023 --> 01:09:01.029
<i>General Eisenhower informs me</i>

01:09:01.031 --> 01:09:04.292
<i>that the forces of
Germany have surrendered</i>

01:09:04.295 --> 01:09:05.863
<i>to the United Nations.</i>

01:09:06.919 --> 01:09:10.566
<i>The flags of freedom
fly all over Europe.</i>

01:09:11.783 --> 01:09:15.750
<i>For this victory, we join
in offering our thanks</i>

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:20.357
<i>to the providence which
has guided and sustained us</i>

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:24.648
