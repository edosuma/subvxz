00:33.137 --> 00:35.605
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
now arriving in New Canaan.

00:35.607 --> 00:38.909
We will be continuing on to
Charlotte in exactly 10 minutes.

00:38.911 --> 00:42.381
If this is your final destination,
please gather your belongings...

00:55.293 --> 00:58.361
<i> Don't look now There's
blood in the water </i>

00:58.363 --> 01:02.266
<i> Listen close You
can hear the holler </i>

01:02.268 --> 01:06.972
<i> There's no place
no place to hide </i>

02:37.229 --> 02:40.496
Hi. Um, I was wondering
if you could help me out.

02:40.498 --> 02:43.699
Um, I'm not trying to sell you
anything. Nothing like that.

02:43.701 --> 02:47.404
I-I've just been trying to track
down someone who used to live here.

02:47.406 --> 02:49.705
Oh. Nobody's lived here but us.

02:49.707 --> 02:52.243
Who's that?

02:59.617 --> 03:02.085
Who exactly are you looking for?

03:02.087 --> 03:05.357
Her name is Millarca Karnstein.

03:10.428 --> 03:16.566
No. No, don't recall anybody by that name.

03:16.568 --> 03:19.369
- You sure?
- Believe me.

03:19.371 --> 03:21.437
I-I'd remember a name like that,

03:21.439 --> 03:24.408
especially round these parts.

03:26.277 --> 03:28.412
Troy Pickett.

03:28.414 --> 03:31.114
- Carmilla.
- Hi. Hi.

03:31.116 --> 03:34.484
Now, could that, uh, be like a nickname?

03:34.486 --> 03:37.054
I mean, could she be
going by some other name?

03:37.056 --> 03:38.687
No, it isn't.

03:38.689 --> 03:40.656
She passed through this town,

03:40.658 --> 03:43.692
and she gave people this
address for her mail.

03:43.694 --> 03:46.531
- This address?
- Yes.

03:48.266 --> 03:51.133
So, no one else lives here who
might have known who she was?

03:51.135 --> 03:54.571
No. Just, uh... Just me and my little girl.

03:54.573 --> 03:58.674
I'd invite you inside, but,
uh, we're headed off to town.

03:58.676 --> 04:01.311
I'm so sorry we can't be more help to you.

04:01.313 --> 04:04.180
It's okay. Thanks for trying.

04:04.182 --> 04:08.452
Okay. Uh, can I give you a ride into town?

04:09.555 --> 04:13.425
- Would you mind?
- Not at all. Let me get my hat.

04:27.873 --> 04:30.474
<i>Hi. I was wondering if I
could get some information...</i>

04:30.476 --> 04:32.575
<i>from the public records.</i>

04:32.577 --> 04:35.544
I'm looking for police reports
or calls to the police...

04:35.546 --> 04:38.547
filed from a particular address.

04:38.549 --> 04:40.316
What address is it?

04:40.318 --> 04:44.821
4880 Highway 58.

04:44.823 --> 04:47.256
- 4880?
- Yes.

04:47.258 --> 04:49.292
Troy Pickett's place.

04:49.294 --> 04:51.561
That's right.

04:51.563 --> 04:54.599
It'll be a couple of days.

04:55.700 --> 04:59.568
Can't you get it any sooner?

04:59.570 --> 05:02.640
Two business days.

05:25.164 --> 05:28.231
I'll get this.

05:28.233 --> 05:32.170
Hey, uh, Linda? Will
you cover three for me?

05:55.661 --> 05:57.393
What?

05:57.395 --> 06:01.398
Not much of a detective.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.633
- You were just at my house.
- Oh. Shit.

06:04.635 --> 06:06.268
I mean, sorry.

06:06.270 --> 06:08.804
Any luck?

06:08.806 --> 06:11.308
No.

06:11.310 --> 06:13.645
Anyway.

06:16.214 --> 06:17.780
Just coffee.

06:17.782 --> 06:22.319
- You're not gonna eat?
- No. Thanks.

06:45.544 --> 06:47.645
Meep-meep.

06:49.013 --> 06:52.484
Look, the reason I didn't order
lunch is because I don't...

06:56.688 --> 06:59.289
Thank you.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.327
You're welcome.

07:03.561 --> 07:06.964
Sit for a sec?

07:11.837 --> 07:14.571
Thanks for this.

07:14.573 --> 07:16.939
It's okay.

07:16.941 --> 07:20.611
Just play it cool, and I'll
just charge you for the coffee.

07:23.414 --> 07:26.349
So, are you traveling all by yourself?

07:26.351 --> 07:29.451
Mm-hmm.

07:29.453 --> 07:32.389
Aren't you scared?

07:41.500 --> 07:46.703
So this Millarca... Is, um...
Is she in some kind of trouble?

07:46.705 --> 07:50.873
No, not that I know of.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.410
Well, who is she?

07:53.412 --> 07:55.544
Or who was she?

07:55.546 --> 07:57.713
"Was," probably.

07:57.715 --> 07:59.948
But I... I don't even know that.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.986
At this point, I'm just looking for traces.

08:02.988 --> 08:06.324
She owe you money or something?

08:13.632 --> 08:17.099
She was my mother.

08:17.101 --> 08:18.835
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:18.837 --> 08:21.403
Why didn't you just say so?

08:21.405 --> 08:24.275
Would it have made a difference?

08:26.544 --> 08:29.712
I guess not.

08:29.714 --> 08:31.847
Besides, I'm looking for answers,

08:31.849 --> 08:34.551
not sympathy.

08:35.885 --> 08:39.457
I'm sorry I said sorry.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.761
When's the last time you saw her?

08:44.763 --> 08:48.031
I never saw her.

08:48.033 --> 08:50.601
She give you up?

08:59.910 --> 09:03.781
Thank you for lunch. You're too nice.

09:19.530 --> 09:21.866
Hey!

09:22.967 --> 09:25.567
She didn't live at the house.

09:25.569 --> 09:28.003
He wasn't lying about that,

09:28.005 --> 09:31.007
technically.

09:31.009 --> 09:34.511
Meet me back here at 3:00,
and I'll show you what I mean.

09:34.513 --> 09:38.547
- Yeah. Okay.
- I mean, it might be nothing.

09:38.549 --> 09:41.117
I'm Carmilla Karnstein.

09:41.119 --> 09:43.485
Laura. Laura Pickett.

09:43.487 --> 09:45.021
I'll be here, Laura.

09:45.023 --> 09:47.558
Okay.

11:12.276 --> 11:15.177
Daddy used to rent it out,

11:15.179 --> 11:19.883
but he stopped because it
was too much of a headache.

11:19.885 --> 11:22.619
And how long ago was that?

11:22.621 --> 11:24.956
Years.

11:32.264 --> 11:35.797
I guess it's possible she could
have lived here for a while,

11:35.799 --> 11:41.472
and... and he just... forgot.

11:49.614 --> 11:52.014
So where do you go from here?

11:52.016 --> 11:54.283
Don't know.

11:54.285 --> 11:57.085
This was, more or less,
the end of the trail.

11:57.087 --> 12:00.058
Here?

12:01.893 --> 12:04.762
She drifted around a lot.

12:06.597 --> 12:10.733
She had a tendency to skip out on rent.

12:10.735 --> 12:14.138
That would explain a lot.

12:16.975 --> 12:21.779
So, if you don't expect
to find your mother,

12:23.948 --> 12:29.051
are you thinking that if
you follow in her footsteps,

12:29.053 --> 12:32.289
that you'll be closer to her somehow?

12:34.992 --> 12:36.859
Hey.

12:36.861 --> 12:39.931
I have an idea.

12:44.235 --> 12:47.235
Pull your hand off the... All the
way... All the way to the fence.

12:47.237 --> 12:49.739
- All the way to the fence. There you go.
- Whoa!

12:49.741 --> 12:52.008
- Whoo! Whoa!
- Pull back on the rein a little bit.

12:52.010 --> 12:55.744
Pull back on the rein.
Pull back on the rein.

12:55.746 --> 12:59.248
- Whoa.
- Pull back on the rein.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.316
Whoa.

13:01.318 --> 13:03.319
I got 'im.

13:03.321 --> 13:05.088
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

13:05.090 --> 13:07.023
- Whoa.
- Whoa. Whoa.

13:07.025 --> 13:10.359
There you go. There you go.

13:10.361 --> 13:12.795
- Okay. This way. Follow me.
- Whoa.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.033
- Keep your arms in.
- I think he likes you better, Daddy.

13:18.035 --> 13:21.738
Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Here we go.

13:26.377 --> 13:28.677
Daddy?

13:28.679 --> 13:30.946
Yes, ma'am.

13:30.948 --> 13:34.950
You know that girl that came
up to the house earlier today?

13:34.952 --> 13:37.353
- Uh-huh.
- She came into the diner too.

13:37.355 --> 13:39.924
This afternoon.

13:43.093 --> 13:44.994
To talk to you?

13:44.996 --> 13:47.397
No, to eat.

13:47.399 --> 13:50.268
We talked for a while though.

13:55.774 --> 13:58.340
You know that woman she's looking for?

13:58.342 --> 14:00.877
Millarca?

14:02.047 --> 14:05.281
She was her mom.

14:05.283 --> 14:07.450
Is that so?

14:07.452 --> 14:10.020
Huh.

14:12.156 --> 14:15.692
She stayed at the trailer, didn't she?

14:17.895 --> 14:21.864
Yeah, for a time she did.

14:21.866 --> 14:24.736
Why didn't you tell her?

14:25.803 --> 14:28.470
Well, baby doll, it's complicated.

14:28.472 --> 14:32.374
But that girl's mother, she was a bad sort.

14:32.376 --> 14:34.877
Into all kinds of bad things.

14:34.879 --> 14:37.279
And, uh, for me to tell the girl that,

14:37.281 --> 14:41.818
I just, uh... I didn't see the good in it.

14:43.388 --> 14:45.455
But that was her mom.

14:45.457 --> 14:49.392
Yeah. That's all... all the more
reason we shouldn't tell her.

14:49.394 --> 14:51.860
See, I know it sounds cruel,

14:51.862 --> 14:56.065
but sometimes it's best
not to know something.

14:56.067 --> 14:59.402
And, uh, if I wasn't completely
truthful with that girl,

14:59.404 --> 15:02.404
it's just because I
didn't want to hurt her.

15:02.406 --> 15:05.874
And that's the God's honest truth.

15:05.876 --> 15:08.009
Yeah.

15:08.011 --> 15:10.812
Still, I feel bad for her though.

15:10.814 --> 15:13.382
Yeah, I know you do.

15:13.384 --> 15:16.085
'Cause that's you.

15:16.087 --> 15:18.454
I feel the same way.

15:18.456 --> 15:20.989
- Good.
- Mm-hmm.

15:20.991 --> 15:24.460
'Cause I told her it'd be all
right if she stayed in the trailer.

15:24.462 --> 15:27.897
Just for a couple of nights.

15:27.899 --> 15:30.532
Please?

15:30.534 --> 15:33.002
Okay. Yeah.

15:33.004 --> 15:36.404
Thank you, Daddy!

15:36.406 --> 15:38.206
Go on now. Go on.

15:38.208 --> 15:41.378
- Thank you!
- Yeah. Yeah.

17:48.473 --> 17:51.540
Morning.

17:51.542 --> 17:54.042
I thought you might want a ride into town.

17:54.044 --> 17:57.112
Thanks, but I'll just hoof it.

17:57.114 --> 17:59.348
Daddy's going deer huntin' this weekend,

17:59.350 --> 18:03.418
so, I thought, if you're still around,

18:03.420 --> 18:07.389
maybe we could take in
a movie or something.

18:07.391 --> 18:11.359
Look, just so you know
and so your father knows,

18:11.361 --> 18:14.564
I'm not looking to move in.

18:19.469 --> 18:22.437
You're staying for a few days, right?

18:22.439 --> 18:25.608
Just until I figure out where to go next.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.376
Well, if you do go into town today,

18:27.378 --> 18:29.311
meet me at the diner at 3:00?

18:29.313 --> 18:31.714
I'll give you a lift home.

18:31.716 --> 18:34.252
Okay.

19:01.312 --> 19:04.314
My room's upstairs.

19:14.726 --> 19:18.293
If you see anything you
wanna borrow, just grab it.

19:18.295 --> 19:20.630
All right.

19:30.507 --> 19:36.212
Hey, Carmilla? Um, I was thinking
maybe we could go grab a bite first.

19:42.186 --> 19:44.786
And then afterwards, I
could show you the town.

19:44.788 --> 19:47.657
That should take all of five minutes.

19:52.162 --> 19:55.399
I didn't check to see what movie's playing.

19:56.501 --> 19:58.667
But people don't really watch the movies.

19:58.669 --> 20:02.305
It's like more of a
hangout place, you know?

20:21.059 --> 20:23.725
I love that one.

20:23.727 --> 20:25.694
She's beautiful.

20:25.696 --> 20:27.629
Yeah.

20:27.631 --> 20:30.099
Do you think maybe I
could talk to her about...

20:30.101 --> 20:34.203
She died when I was eight.

20:34.205 --> 20:36.540
I'm sorry.

20:38.842 --> 20:41.543
- Shit. I get it now.
- What?

20:41.545 --> 20:44.148
Why didn't you say anything?

20:48.852 --> 20:52.422
Come on. Let's go.

21:06.269 --> 21:09.737
<i>Candy galore! There's
soft drinks, coffee...</i>

21:09.739 --> 21:11.474
Done.

21:11.476 --> 21:14.277
<i>And a whole lot more!</i>

21:16.613 --> 21:20.217
Do you see a silver Mustang anywhere?

21:21.319 --> 21:24.722
Oh, I think I see it over there.

21:28.726 --> 21:31.292
So,

21:31.294 --> 21:33.762
what do you say to someone...

21:33.764 --> 21:36.564
when you think you like them,

21:36.566 --> 21:40.269
but... you're not really sure,

21:40.271 --> 21:44.241
so you... you wanna...

21:45.342 --> 21:47.810
Um, Laura, don't take this the wrong way.

21:47.812 --> 21:50.178
As much as I'd like to help you,

21:50.180 --> 21:56.452
I don't think I'm the person to be giving
you advice about men, boys, whatever.

21:56.454 --> 21:58.387
You don't have to.

21:58.389 --> 22:00.755
- That's something someone else should do.
- I understand.

22:00.757 --> 22:03.760
Friends?

22:04.896 --> 22:07.530
An aunt?

22:07.532 --> 22:11.502
Cousins? Anyone?

22:13.504 --> 22:17.640
- I'm sorry.
- Stop apologizing.

22:19.243 --> 22:22.244
Look, you're fine. Go have fun.

22:22.246 --> 22:25.481
I'll just wait here, I guess.

22:25.483 --> 22:29.217
You're the best.

22:29.219 --> 22:31.853
<i>We promise to satisfy your hunger,</i>

22:31.855 --> 22:34.590
<i>your thirst, your sweet tooth.</i>

22:34.592 --> 22:36.824
<i>So visit our refreshment center now.</i>

22:36.826 --> 22:39.828
<i>Let's go!</i>

22:39.830 --> 22:43.264
<i>If you are thirsty, try
ice-cold soft drinks...</i>

22:43.266 --> 22:45.767
<i>or a cup of hot, flavorful coffee.</i>

22:45.769 --> 22:49.772
<i>Get something to go with it, like
a sizzling and satisfying hot dog.</i>

22:49.774 --> 22:52.273
<i>Or a tasty...</i>

22:52.275 --> 22:55.813
She has a date with a silver Mustang.

23:04.354 --> 23:07.857
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:09.493 --> 23:12.696
Don't you look pretty.

23:20.303 --> 23:23.772
Where are we going?

23:23.774 --> 23:25.940
Nowhere.

23:32.449 --> 23:36.586
<i> I'll brake for
anything but you </i>

23:38.555 --> 23:40.455
<i>hiding from the police.</i>

23:40.457 --> 23:42.690
<i>Put them in a forest
more ominous than death,</i>

23:42.692 --> 23:45.793
<i>and listen to their screams.</i>

23:48.466 --> 23:50.965
<i>They learn what fate awaits them.</i>

23:52.769 --> 23:55.571
<i>Some places possess
an evil of their own,</i>

23:55.573 --> 23:59.007
<i>where the air is thick with
the shrieks of tortured souls,</i>

23:59.009 --> 24:03.311
<i>where the earth tries to swallow every
trace of those foolish mortals...</i>

24:03.313 --> 24:06.615
You didn't come here to
watch a movie, did ya?

24:06.617 --> 24:09.551
No.

24:09.553 --> 24:11.286
Why?

24:11.288 --> 24:13.957
I came here to see you.

24:17.861 --> 24:20.663
So look at me.

24:24.601 --> 24:27.237
Come here.

24:28.973 --> 24:31.508
Closer.

25:01.339 --> 25:05.409
You like that?

25:07.844 --> 25:10.747
I bet you do.

25:14.552 --> 25:16.954
Hey.

25:20.024 --> 25:22.892
Just this once.

25:31.502 --> 25:34.438
Come on.

25:35.805 --> 25:40.109
<i>They're just sores,
nothing contagious.</i>

25:40.111 --> 25:42.946
<i>Try not to let them bother you.</i>

26:17.515 --> 26:19.882
Laura.

26:40.638 --> 26:43.506
What'd you do to her?

26:45.208 --> 26:47.074
And who are you, huh?

26:47.076 --> 26:50.813
I'm the woman who wants
you to get out of the car.

26:51.849 --> 26:54.849
Come on. Get out of the car.

26:54.851 --> 26:57.153
Back off, cunt.

27:01.725 --> 27:05.062
Kill the engine! Get out of the car.

27:23.746 --> 27:27.483
Come on.

27:27.485 --> 27:29.917
You really want me to get out of this car?

27:29.919 --> 27:34.658
I so want you to get out of the car.

27:38.128 --> 27:40.931
Carmilla?

27:54.945 --> 27:57.714
Take me home?

28:00.751 --> 28:03.120
Crazy female.

28:11.695 --> 28:14.228
You can't let 'em get
away with shit like that.

28:14.230 --> 28:17.099
They're like bullies in a school yard.

28:17.101 --> 28:21.770
Once they see a weakness, they
line up for a turn to exploit it.

28:21.772 --> 28:23.272
It's not like that.

28:23.274 --> 28:25.640
I mean, I could say no.

28:25.642 --> 28:29.278
Then why don't you?

28:29.280 --> 28:32.281
Is it the attention?

28:32.283 --> 28:34.917
Is this town that much of a shithole...

28:34.919 --> 28:38.753
that the only way you can talk to a
guy is with his dick in your mouth?

28:38.755 --> 28:41.657
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I happen to like cock.

28:41.659 --> 28:45.528
I just don't like the
assholes they're attached to.

28:56.573 --> 28:59.543
What?

29:07.751 --> 29:12.219
Laura, relax.

29:12.221 --> 29:14.790
Okay?

29:15.959 --> 29:18.528
Yeah?

29:19.996 --> 29:22.533
I'm sorry.

29:27.004 --> 29:28.971
You ever think about maybe going away,

29:28.973 --> 29:32.608
maybe to school?

29:32.610 --> 29:34.909
I've thought about it.

29:34.911 --> 29:37.279
Started saving up.

29:37.281 --> 29:39.947
Didn't get very far.

29:39.949 --> 29:43.651
Well, there are other things you could do.

29:43.653 --> 29:45.786
I mean, I wanna be out on my own,

29:45.788 --> 29:50.692
but I'm just terrified at the
idea of being all by myself.

29:50.694 --> 29:53.830
Being alone's not so bad.

29:58.034 --> 30:00.571
So,

30:01.971 --> 30:06.207
are you alone right now?

30:06.209 --> 30:11.980
No. I'm with you.

30:11.982 --> 30:14.851
You know what I mean.

30:22.426 --> 30:29.130
<i> On shoulders of giants
you find yourself </i>

30:42.345 --> 30:45.213
<i>So many people are afraid
to get off the road.</i>

30:45.215 --> 30:49.653
<i>And they're not familiar with the
solitude you can have in the woods.</i>

30:51.088 --> 30:53.254
<i>People know so little
bit about the woods.</i>

30:53.256 --> 30:56.090
<i>The woods is a friendly place.</i>

30:56.092 --> 30:58.092
I'm going to bed.

30:58.094 --> 31:00.361
<i>Treat wildlife and the
outdoors with respect.</i>

31:00.363 --> 31:03.330
What'd you do tonight?

31:03.332 --> 31:05.300
Went to the drive-in.

31:05.302 --> 31:08.936
<i>Make it a practice to observe all the
rules of safe, responsible bow hunting.</i>

31:08.938 --> 31:10.772
With that girl?

31:10.774 --> 31:12.440
Mm-hmm.

31:12.442 --> 31:14.909
<i>Ask the permission of
property owners to hunt...</i>

31:14.911 --> 31:18.112
What you all talk about?

31:18.114 --> 31:22.016
Nothing. Just boys.

31:22.018 --> 31:25.887
Then what?

31:25.889 --> 31:28.423
Came back home to the trailer.

31:28.425 --> 31:30.927
Watched TV.

31:32.996 --> 31:35.964
Come here.

31:35.966 --> 31:37.898
Come here.

31:37.900 --> 31:43.938
You know what? I can't help asking
because I'm worried about you.

31:43.940 --> 31:46.006
Daddy, you don't have to worry about me.

31:46.008 --> 31:47.509
No?

31:47.511 --> 31:50.311
You a big girl now?

31:50.313 --> 31:52.880
- You can take care of yourself?
- Yeah.

31:52.882 --> 31:56.885
Uh-huh. What if you run into
the big, bad wolf out there?

31:56.887 --> 31:58.853
- Can you handle that?
- Yeah.

31:58.855 --> 32:03.224
Yeah? What if it's the devil himself,

32:03.226 --> 32:06.261
and he reaches out and he grabs you?

32:08.465 --> 32:10.331
Ah!

32:14.138 --> 32:17.238
You know, you're my everything, Laura.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.942
Just my everything.

32:21.078 --> 32:23.078
You know what?

32:23.080 --> 32:26.113
I made a covenant when your mother passed.

32:26.115 --> 32:28.550
I said I would never...
never marry another woman,

32:28.552 --> 32:30.886
never look at her...

32:30.888 --> 32:32.788
till you were settled down with someone.

32:32.790 --> 32:35.157
Daddy, I wouldn't mind
if you did. I... I...

32:35.159 --> 32:37.792
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

32:37.794 --> 32:39.828
Come on. Shh.

32:39.830 --> 32:43.497
That's my word, and I'm
gonna keep it, no matter what.

32:43.499 --> 32:46.035
Yeah?

32:48.104 --> 32:50.871
Oh, baby doll, you're my
whole world. You know that?

32:50.873 --> 32:54.943
You're my whole world.

32:54.945 --> 32:57.378
You know, sometimes,

32:57.380 --> 33:00.150
when I hold you here like this,

33:01.284 --> 33:04.351
and I close my eyes,

33:04.353 --> 33:07.155
sometimes I swear I could...

33:07.157 --> 33:10.193
I could be with her.

34:13.657 --> 34:16.891
You have a right to be angry.

34:18.960 --> 34:21.161
Fuck you.

34:21.164 --> 34:24.632
Well, that's real nice.

34:24.635 --> 34:27.434
That's the way you talk to people?

34:27.436 --> 34:32.539
People that take you in,
give you a place to stay?

34:32.541 --> 34:34.541
Might be hard for you to understand,

34:34.543 --> 34:36.678
but I was only lookin' out for you.

34:36.679 --> 34:41.081
No, you weren't. You just wanted me gone.

34:41.083 --> 34:42.917
But you're hiding something.

34:42.918 --> 34:46.420
I can see it in your face.

34:46.422 --> 34:49.356
I'll tell you anything you
want to know about Millarca.

34:49.358 --> 34:51.592
You think that's gonna make you happy?

34:51.594 --> 34:54.929
I got a feeling it won't.

34:54.931 --> 34:57.267
Come here.

34:59.702 --> 35:02.238
Come here.

35:15.385 --> 35:19.720
You know what? I'm not looking
for any favors or a handout.

35:19.722 --> 35:22.957
All I want to know, all I've
wanted to know from the start,

35:22.959 --> 35:26.093
is just what she was like...

35:26.095 --> 35:28.229
and where she might have
gone after she left here.

35:28.231 --> 35:30.365
That's it.

35:30.367 --> 35:34.204
Not gonna find that out reading those
police reports, I'll tell you that.

35:36.706 --> 35:40.175
You know how she came to be here?

35:40.177 --> 35:41.742
She was driving across Route 20.

35:41.744 --> 35:43.577
Colored fellow behind the wheel.

35:43.579 --> 35:46.280
Guy by the name of Dwight, um...

35:46.282 --> 35:48.550
something or other.

35:48.552 --> 35:51.019
It was in the middle of the night.

35:51.021 --> 35:53.722
We found out the next day they were
trying to get to Montgomery by morning.

35:53.724 --> 35:56.390
Montgomery.

35:56.392 --> 35:59.461
So about the time they're
comin' through New Canaan,

35:59.463 --> 36:04.365
this Dwight fella, he falls asleep.

36:04.367 --> 36:07.769
Runs smack into a bridge support.

36:07.771 --> 36:10.340
Didn't kill 'em.

36:14.510 --> 36:17.479
<i>Didn't kill neither one of them.</i>

36:19.782 --> 36:21.749
<i>But your mama was hurt worse...</i>

36:21.751 --> 36:24.419
<i>'cause the side of the
road they went off on.</i>

36:24.421 --> 36:27.421
<i>So they took her
off to the hospital.</i>

36:27.423 --> 36:30.425
<i>And this, uh... this colored fella,</i>

36:30.427 --> 36:34.028
<i>he goes on about how he's
got to get to Montgomery,</i>

36:34.030 --> 36:39.201
<i>that his daddy is sick, uh, close
to death or some such thing.</i>

36:40.269 --> 36:42.403
<i>The car is scrap.</i>

36:42.405 --> 36:44.405
Totaled.

36:44.407 --> 36:46.608
This fella reaches into
your mother's pocketbook...

36:46.610 --> 36:49.477
and he takes her money.

36:49.479 --> 36:53.616
Buys himself a bus ticket.
Ain't that somethin'?

36:56.452 --> 36:58.053
Yeah.

36:58.055 --> 37:00.488
Yeah.

37:00.490 --> 37:03.994
Leaves her there in the
hospital, unconscious.

37:05.595 --> 37:07.796
But he gives her a note.

37:07.798 --> 37:10.097
It says, "I'll be back in five days."

37:10.099 --> 37:14.535
Well, you can guess how
that turned out, huh?

37:14.537 --> 37:17.472
So they called Montgomery.

37:17.474 --> 37:20.175
Called all the hospitals.

37:20.177 --> 37:22.544
But nobody's ever heard
of this guy named Dwight.

37:22.546 --> 37:25.747
Dwight, uh...

37:25.749 --> 37:28.515
I suppose I can call down there
and get his name, if you like.

37:28.517 --> 37:30.218
Lewis.

37:30.220 --> 37:33.454
Oh, you know him.

37:33.456 --> 37:35.090
I know all about him.

37:35.092 --> 37:37.394
<i>Ah.</i>

37:38.762 --> 37:42.796
So they let her out of the hospital.

37:42.798 --> 37:45.867
What's she gonna do? Got no money.

37:45.869 --> 37:49.504
Doesn't act like she's
got anyplace to go back to.

37:49.506 --> 37:52.439
So she takes a job waiting
tables at the diner.

37:52.441 --> 37:55.577
- The diner?
- My wife Karen took her in.

37:55.579 --> 38:00.481
She and Laura are a lot
alike in that regard.

38:00.483 --> 38:04.184
How long was she here?

38:04.186 --> 38:06.488
Half a year.

38:06.490 --> 38:10.225
After a month or two, we asked if she
could put something toward the rent.

38:10.227 --> 38:13.827
Laura was little. I was on disability.
It was hard to make ends meet.

38:13.829 --> 38:17.198
But, uh, she didn't give us no money.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.437
Karen seemed to think she was on dope.

38:22.606 --> 38:24.738
One day she didn't turn up at the diner.

38:24.740 --> 38:27.441
Karen went down there to look for her.

38:27.443 --> 38:30.544
Millarca had up and moved out.

38:30.546 --> 38:33.280
Took a little TV and a
radio we kept down there.

38:33.282 --> 38:36.452
We found it at the pawnshop in town.

38:39.789 --> 38:43.224
You have no idea where she went after that?

38:43.226 --> 38:46.494
See now, darlin', when you
steal something from somebody,

38:46.496 --> 38:50.465
you don't generally tell
'em where you're headed.

38:50.467 --> 38:53.901
I would have told you all
this up front, but, uh,

38:53.903 --> 38:57.139
I didn't see the good in it.

39:04.914 --> 39:09.119
I'll pay you something
for the nights I was here.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.256
No.

39:14.724 --> 39:17.658
No, you don't have to do that.

39:17.660 --> 39:20.428
But I tell you what.

39:20.430 --> 39:23.430
If you're plannin' on movin' on,

39:23.432 --> 39:26.800
I'd prefer that you did it
sooner rather than later.

39:26.802 --> 39:31.838
See, Laura has a tendency
to get attached to people.

39:31.840 --> 39:35.410
And I don't want to see
her get hurt no more.

39:37.414 --> 39:39.881
Okay.

39:39.883 --> 39:42.418
Okay.

40:51.387 --> 40:54.489
Carmilla? I'm coming in.

41:15.611 --> 41:18.412
I was wondering if you
had a chance to search.

41:18.414 --> 41:21.351
Got it for you right here.

41:31.660 --> 41:33.996
Laura?

41:36.066 --> 41:38.066
Baby doll, you all right?

41:42.104 --> 41:44.104
You ran her off, didn't you?

41:44.106 --> 41:48.343
No, no, no, I didn't. I-I told
her what she came here to find out.

41:48.345 --> 41:50.477
I liked having her here.

41:52.081 --> 41:55.048
- I liked having someone to talk to.
- Yeah. Well...

41:55.050 --> 41:57.684
And you... you ran her
off 'cause you're jealous.

41:57.686 --> 41:59.653
No. No, I... No, I...

41:59.655 --> 42:04.658
I ran her off because if she's anything
like her mother, she's dangerous.

42:04.660 --> 42:06.593
Dangerous?

42:06.595 --> 42:11.466
Yeah, I'm not about to let her hurt
you the way she hurt your mother.

42:11.468 --> 42:13.100
See there?

42:13.102 --> 42:16.803
See what you get when you
start asking too many questions?

42:16.805 --> 42:20.742
See, sometimes it's better
off not to know somethin'.

42:21.977 --> 42:24.847
How did she hurt Mother?

42:25.914 --> 42:27.648
You don't remember her?

42:27.650 --> 42:29.985
At all?

42:34.691 --> 42:37.725
She and your mama worked
at the diner together.

42:37.727 --> 42:40.363
Did you know that?

42:45.568 --> 42:49.604
Yeah, the two of them
were pretty good friends,

42:49.606 --> 42:52.140
which I, for the life of
me, couldn't understand.

42:54.510 --> 42:57.577
<i>Your mama was a fine
Christian woman.</i>

43:01.017 --> 43:06.489
<i>This Millarca, she... she
wasn't worth shootin'.</i>

43:08.892 --> 43:10.925
<i>I figured her for
some kind of a gypsy,</i>

43:10.927 --> 43:14.430
<i>but your mama swore she wasn't.</i>

43:19.135 --> 43:22.970
<i>The way she dressed,
the way she acted,</i>

43:22.972 --> 43:26.474
<i>the way she put all kinds of
ideas in your mama's head...</i>

43:26.476 --> 43:29.510
Like what?

43:29.512 --> 43:33.981
<i>Like she was wonderful
and beautiful.</i>

43:33.983 --> 43:36.751
So?

43:36.753 --> 43:40.021
<i>Like she was too good to be
livin' out in the sticks...</i>

43:40.023 --> 43:44.091
<i>and she should run away
with her, leave us behind.</i>

43:44.093 --> 43:46.963
Me and you.

43:49.164 --> 43:53.800
Yeah, the two of them used
to run around a lot together.

43:53.802 --> 43:58.940
<i>Which pretty much left me to
take care of you by myself.</i>

44:00.477 --> 44:05.012
<i>I remember us sittin'
in the truck...</i>

44:05.014 --> 44:07.916
<i>really late at night.</i>

44:09.218 --> 44:11.720
That's right.

44:13.490 --> 44:16.858
You were spying on them.

44:16.860 --> 44:20.561
<i>That's right.</i>

44:20.563 --> 44:23.129
I tried to tolerate it.

44:23.131 --> 44:26.867
I pretty much put up with
anything to make your mama happy.

44:26.869 --> 44:30.105
I mean, I... I loved her that much.

44:34.010 --> 44:37.278
<i>Your mother took to sleeping
in the upstairs bedroom.</i>

44:37.280 --> 44:40.981
<i>I didn't know what else
to do but to let her.</i>

44:40.983 --> 44:46.121
<i>Wasn't but a little bit, I started
to see something different.</i>

44:47.557 --> 44:49.823
<i>She started to look sickly.</i>

44:49.825 --> 44:54.294
<i>And she started losing weight. She
barely had the strength to get around.</i>

44:54.296 --> 44:58.064
<i>See, when she was alone with me, she
tried acting like her same old self,</i>

44:58.066 --> 45:00.600
<i>but the spark just wasn't there.</i>

45:00.602 --> 45:03.537
I mean, she was tired all the time.

45:03.539 --> 45:06.807
Then she started having dizzy spells.

45:06.809 --> 45:09.042
So I took her to the doctor.

45:09.044 --> 45:13.113
And they... they thought she had
some kind of a blood disorder.

45:13.115 --> 45:15.883
Yeah, they ran a bunch of tests.

45:15.885 --> 45:19.287
Anemia and, uh, leukemia.

45:19.289 --> 45:23.092
They didn't know what they was lookin' for.

45:24.760 --> 45:27.160
<i>Finally, I got fed up.</i>

45:27.162 --> 45:29.564
<i>I said, "That's enough."</i>

45:29.566 --> 45:31.731
I told 'em, "That's it.

45:31.733 --> 45:36.137
I... I'll look for answers my own way."

45:36.139 --> 45:39.709
<i>I asked the good Lord for guidance.</i>

45:41.677 --> 45:44.012
I remember.

45:55.124 --> 45:59.928
<i>I fasted, and I prayed.</i>

46:17.046 --> 46:19.849
<i>I asked him for enlightenment.</i>

46:30.927 --> 46:34.296
<i>Finally, he put the answer
right here in my heart.</i>

46:36.965 --> 46:39.868
What did he say?

46:52.347 --> 46:54.914
Go to sleep now, all right?

46:54.916 --> 46:57.684
I'm gonna be right in the next room.

46:57.686 --> 46:59.120
Okay. Good night.

46:59.122 --> 47:01.857
Leave the light on.

47:03.226 --> 47:06.292
I'll leave the hall light on.

47:06.294 --> 47:09.030
I'm scared.

47:10.900 --> 47:13.401
I'll be right here.

47:13.403 --> 47:16.272
Go to sleep now.

47:21.778 --> 47:23.977
<i>See, I-I-I
knew...</i>

47:23.979 --> 47:26.814
<i>Millarca had something
to do with it.</i>

47:26.816 --> 47:30.450
<i>And one night...</i>

47:30.452 --> 47:32.720
<i>I decided I was gonna find out...</i>

47:32.722 --> 47:35.624
<i>what was going on.</i>

47:38.260 --> 47:41.162
What did you do?

48:40.490 --> 48:45.892
"I was in the trailer rented
to me by Troy Pickett."

48:45.894 --> 48:50.497
Karen Pickett was staying
at the trailer with me.

48:50.499 --> 48:55.103
"Having had a domestic
disagreement with her husband."

49:40.249 --> 49:42.785
Stop! No!

49:44.553 --> 49:48.023
Stop! Troy!

49:50.325 --> 49:52.861
It's not her.

49:54.597 --> 49:57.530
It's me.

50:18.387 --> 50:21.321
<i>"Fearing for my life,
I fled on foot...</i>

50:21.323 --> 50:24.559
<i>toward Old Oak Road."</i>

50:59.662 --> 51:01.562
Son of a bitch.

51:06.068 --> 51:09.202
<i> I took you down to
the river tonight </i>

51:14.175 --> 51:17.443
<i> I went along for
the one-way ride </i>

51:17.445 --> 51:19.345
You're leaving.

51:19.347 --> 51:22.082
With me.

51:22.084 --> 51:24.587
Tonight.

51:34.697 --> 51:38.999
We have to go. The sooner, the better.

51:39.001 --> 51:41.501
Where are your things?

51:41.503 --> 51:44.604
I can't leave yet.

51:44.606 --> 51:47.041
There's something I have to tell you.

51:47.043 --> 51:50.044
No. You don't have to. I read
the police report. I know.

51:50.046 --> 51:52.979
Did the police report say
why he did what he did?

51:52.981 --> 51:55.182
Why he beat her half to death?

51:55.184 --> 51:59.519
Why he tried to run her over with
a truck? No. I don't need to know.

51:59.521 --> 52:03.256
- You need to know.
- Jesus Christ, Laura.

52:03.258 --> 52:06.292
Isn't that why you came here?

52:06.294 --> 52:09.329
To find out who she was?

52:09.331 --> 52:11.332
Who <i>they</i> were?

52:11.334 --> 52:12.999
<i>What</i> they were?

52:13.001 --> 52:15.169
My mother and your mother...

52:15.171 --> 52:17.204
Were lovers.

52:17.206 --> 52:21.742
- Did you know that?
- I figured as much.

52:21.744 --> 52:24.611
There's more.

52:24.613 --> 52:27.046
But you'll never believe me if I tell you.

52:27.048 --> 52:28.716
Laura.

52:28.718 --> 52:32.452
But I could show you.

52:32.454 --> 52:37.592
I never knew how much like
my mother I was until now,

52:39.095 --> 52:42.031
how much we have in common.

52:55.110 --> 52:58.412
I've always hated myself for the way I am.

52:58.414 --> 53:00.513
But now I realize it's okay.

53:00.515 --> 53:02.716
It's how she was.

53:02.718 --> 53:06.188
All along it was who I was meant to be.

53:17.133 --> 53:21.035
This is the way it was that night...

53:21.037 --> 53:26.372
when my father came down to the
trailer and looked in the window.

53:26.374 --> 53:29.209
They were in this room.

53:29.211 --> 53:32.812
They were on this bed.

53:32.814 --> 53:35.617
Just as we are now.

53:46.162 --> 53:49.398
<i>They were in this room.</i>

53:52.133 --> 53:55.403
<i>They were on this bed.</i>

53:59.374 --> 54:02.343
<i>Just as we are now.</i>

54:07.749 --> 54:10.686
<i>They were in this room.</i>

54:15.423 --> 54:18.293
<i>They were on this bed.</i>

54:23.398 --> 54:26.367
<i>Just as we are now.</i>

54:30.206 --> 54:32.640
<i>In this room.</i>

54:36.611 --> 54:39.680
<i>On this bed.</i>

54:42.184 --> 54:45.086
<i>Just as we are now.</i>

54:51.727 --> 54:54.296
Carmilla, it's okay.

55:03.539 --> 55:06.441
It's okay. It's okay.

55:17.887 --> 55:21.356
<i>He told me everything.</i>

55:22.858 --> 55:25.660
<i>Let me show you.</i>

55:39.275 --> 55:42.244
Open my flesh wide.

55:43.646 --> 55:46.247
Consume me.

55:47.715 --> 55:50.818
Finish what they started.

56:04.832 --> 56:07.200
Laura?

56:07.202 --> 56:09.704
Hey...

56:16.445 --> 56:18.345
Oh, sweet Jesus.

56:18.347 --> 56:19.912
Morning, Daddy.

59:20.662 --> 59:23.763
You don't have to stay here, you know.

59:23.765 --> 59:26.066
I can't leave.

59:26.068 --> 59:27.867
Why not?

59:27.869 --> 59:31.872
I was born here. This is where I belong.

59:43.485 --> 59:47.421
Lord, hear all good prayers
for us. For Jesus' sake. Amen.

59:47.423 --> 59:49.858
- Amen.
- Mm-hmm.

59:52.760 --> 59:54.760
- Wait a second. What is this?
- Careful.

59:54.762 --> 59:56.829
- What is that right there?
- I-It's fine.

59:56.831 --> 59:59.832
I cut myself on the bread
rack at work. It's fine.

59:59.834 --> 01:00:02.068
Did you put some antiseptic on that?

01:00:02.070 --> 01:00:04.805
Just eat. Okay?

01:00:04.807 --> 01:00:08.642
I'm bushed, and I'm not looking
forward to cleaning up the kitchen.

01:00:09.845 --> 01:00:13.615
You could help out a little
more around here, you know.

01:00:32.934 --> 01:00:35.635
I can't stay here. You know that.

01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:39.773
- Just a couple of nights. I've already paid for it.
- Laura.

01:00:39.775 --> 01:00:41.908
Please?

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:46.946
It's not that complicated. You drive to
your house, pack some things, we drive off.

01:00:46.948 --> 01:00:49.983
I will. I will.

01:00:49.985 --> 01:00:52.619
I just need to come up with an excuse.

01:00:52.621 --> 01:00:56.590
You don't need an excuse.
You're a goddamn adult.

01:01:13.842 --> 01:01:17.042
I'm sorry.

01:01:17.044 --> 01:01:21.682
You say "I'm sorry" one more
time, and I swear to God...

01:01:30.526 --> 01:01:32.928
Hold on.

01:01:36.631 --> 01:01:39.733
- That's another thing.
- What?

01:01:39.735 --> 01:01:43.472
I'm thinking we should try
it once without the knife.

01:01:48.276 --> 01:01:51.178
- Carmilla...
- Relax.

01:01:58.921 --> 01:02:01.555
Jesus, Laura.

01:02:01.557 --> 01:02:04.758
I tried to tell you.

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.762
It's not because of them.

01:02:09.697 --> 01:02:11.564
It's because of me.

01:02:11.566 --> 01:02:14.800
It's who I am.

01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:17.137
But I don't cut myself anymore. I swear.

01:02:17.139 --> 01:02:19.606
I know, 'cause I do
all the cutting for you.

01:02:30.686 --> 01:02:33.188
Come here.

01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:39.661
It's just skin.

01:02:52.173 --> 01:02:54.006
No more cutting, Laura.

01:02:54.008 --> 01:02:57.276
Okay.

01:02:57.278 --> 01:02:59.880
Okay.

01:03:08.289 --> 01:03:10.756
No more cutting.

01:03:10.758 --> 01:03:13.695
Not me, not you.

01:03:54.403 --> 01:03:57.738
We don't need a knife.

01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:02.009
It doesn't have to hurt.

01:04:05.847 --> 01:04:09.082
No more blood.

01:04:09.084 --> 01:04:11.720
No more guilt.

01:04:14.456 --> 01:04:17.124
No more fear.

01:04:19.927 --> 01:04:22.296
No more pain.

01:04:26.735 --> 01:04:30.035
No. No, I... I... I need the knife.

01:04:30.037 --> 01:04:33.173
I need the blood.

01:04:33.175 --> 01:04:36.443
I need the guilt...

01:04:36.445 --> 01:04:38.778
and to feel the pain.

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:43.651
How do you know if you haven't
felt love any other way?

01:04:57.298 --> 01:04:59.131
Laura, look at me.

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:01.802
Focus on my eyes.

01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:18.053
This is what love is supposed to be like.

01:06:17.111 --> 01:06:20.445
You been spending time
with that girl, haven't you?

01:06:20.447 --> 01:06:22.948
- A little.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:26.919
After what I told you?

01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:29.588
- She's not her mother.
- Yeah?

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:31.925
What about you?

01:06:31.927 --> 01:06:33.959
Aren't you like <i>your</i> mother?

01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:36.361
Or are you somebody totally different?

01:06:36.363 --> 01:06:39.800
- I wouldn't know.
- Yeah.

01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:49.475
Sometimes people don't know who
they are till they get older.

01:06:49.477 --> 01:06:52.544
They got nothing in common
with their parents...

01:06:52.546 --> 01:06:55.881
and then find themselves doing
the same thing their parents did,

01:06:55.883 --> 01:06:59.352
believing in the same things and...

01:06:59.354 --> 01:07:02.890
usually making the same mistakes.

01:07:05.026 --> 01:07:07.359
I hated my daddy,

01:07:07.361 --> 01:07:09.629
and I find myself...

01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:12.064
more and more like him every day.

01:07:12.066 --> 01:07:14.334
And I'm just saying this...

01:07:14.336 --> 01:07:17.937
'cause I'm trying to keep you from going
down the same path that your mama did.

01:07:17.939 --> 01:07:22.274
- What's wrong with the path my mama took?
- Stop arguing with me.

01:07:22.276 --> 01:07:24.343
You're just like your mama.

01:07:24.345 --> 01:07:28.013
You think you know everything, don't
listen to nobody. Look what it got her.

01:07:28.015 --> 01:07:29.883
Millarca didn't kill my mother.

01:07:29.885 --> 01:07:31.917
Oh, yeah? Were you there?

01:07:31.919 --> 01:07:34.988
- Cancer killed my mother.
- So the doctors say.

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:40.225
- So you think you know better than the doctors?
- I know what I saw with my eyes.

01:07:40.227 --> 01:07:42.528
I seen your mother waste away to nothin'.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:45.198
- I looked into that Millarca woman's face.
- Daddy.

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.600
Well, if you'd seen what I've seen...

01:07:47.602 --> 01:07:50.470
I had never seen the look of
such absolute evil in my life.

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:52.305
Oh, would you come off it?

01:07:52.307 --> 01:07:55.374
Listen to me. Just listen to me!

01:07:55.376 --> 01:07:59.044
Stop your moaning and groaning and pay attention
to someone that's trying to help you!

01:07:59.046 --> 01:08:01.580
- Calm down.
- You think you're so smart.

01:08:01.582 --> 01:08:05.285
You and her and the doctors. Couldn't
none of you do nothin' to save her.

01:08:05.287 --> 01:08:06.686
But <i>I</i> did!

01:08:06.688 --> 01:08:08.988
Yeah.

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:12.260
You tried to run her
girlfriend over with your truck.

01:08:13.494 --> 01:08:17.162
I did more than that.

01:08:17.163 --> 01:08:20.466
What'd you do?

01:08:20.468 --> 01:08:24.404
I caught her red-handed.

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.273
Laura!

01:08:30.478 --> 01:08:33.113
Laura?

01:08:35.582 --> 01:08:38.518
I'm not done talking to you.

01:08:41.589 --> 01:08:44.225
Laura?

01:09:05.714 --> 01:09:07.680
Laura?

01:09:11.185 --> 01:09:14.455
Baby doll, uh...

01:09:18.393 --> 01:09:21.158
Daddy wants to see you.

01:09:23.298 --> 01:09:27.367
I-I-I... I
gotta see you.

01:09:30.705 --> 01:09:33.439
<i>I just gotta look at you, baby,</i>

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:36.510
<i>to know I'm not too late.</i>

01:09:48.455 --> 01:09:51.524
If I thought anything
bad has happened to you...

01:10:42.744 --> 01:10:45.410
Oh, my Jesus!

01:10:45.412 --> 01:10:48.549
It's not what you think!

01:10:50.384 --> 01:10:53.252
It's not!

01:10:53.254 --> 01:10:56.321
Daddy, wait!

01:10:56.323 --> 01:10:59.494
Where are you going?

01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:15.135
Daddy?

01:13:22.737 --> 01:13:26.874
Don't move. You need to
wait for an ambulance.

01:13:35.916 --> 01:13:37.717
J-Just be still.

01:13:37.719 --> 01:13:40.588
Help will be here soon.

01:13:42.889 --> 01:13:45.726
Fuck.

01:14:45.585 --> 01:14:48.753
Where are you going?

01:14:48.755 --> 01:14:51.925
Tell me where you're going!

01:14:57.464 --> 01:14:59.833
Show me.

01:16:03.464 --> 01:16:06.132
- What are you doing here?
- I had to see you.

01:16:06.134 --> 01:16:08.167
But you can't.

01:16:08.169 --> 01:16:09.868
He'll kill you.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:11.703
I just want to talk.

01:16:11.705 --> 01:16:13.905
Millarca, I can't.

01:16:13.907 --> 01:16:17.877
Why? Because he says so?

01:16:17.879 --> 01:16:21.446
It just isn't right.

01:16:21.448 --> 01:16:24.384
Since when?

01:16:28.723 --> 01:16:31.492
Just for a minute.

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:39.833
Did something change?

01:16:40.867 --> 01:16:43.603
What changed, Karen?

01:16:45.973 --> 01:16:48.876
Did you change?

01:16:54.482 --> 01:16:58.586
He's coming. Quick. Hide behind the door.

01:17:17.138 --> 01:17:20.905
Hey. You didn't say good night to me.

01:17:20.907 --> 01:17:23.141
I'm sorry.

01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:25.979
Just really tired. That's all.

01:17:27.048 --> 01:17:29.148
Huh. What?

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:32.052
I just got the chills.

01:17:33.086 --> 01:17:36.254
Why don't you come downstairs
and watch some TV with me?

01:17:36.256 --> 01:17:39.727
Um, tomorrow.

01:17:40.862 --> 01:17:43.864
I will. I promise.

01:17:44.965 --> 01:17:46.899
You don't have to worry about me.

01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:49.502
You don't have to worry about me.

01:17:49.504 --> 01:17:52.538
- Anymore.
- Anymore.

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.709
I love you.

01:17:56.777 --> 01:17:59.146
Good night.

01:18:17.231 --> 01:18:20.166
I'll be very quiet.

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:36.917
<i>The serpent had beguiled her.</i>

01:18:38.052 --> 01:18:41.720
And she had eaten,

01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:44.657
on this very bed.

01:18:47.695 --> 01:18:50.596
You are mine,

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:53.932
and you <i>shall</i> be mine.

01:18:53.934 --> 01:18:55.700
And you and I...

01:18:55.702 --> 01:18:57.336
are one...

01:18:57.338 --> 01:19:00.006
forever.

01:19:47.021 --> 01:19:50.021
<i>I knew I couldn't save her.</i>

01:19:50.023 --> 01:19:52.927
<i>I failed your mother.</i>

01:19:55.996 --> 01:19:59.731
<i>I couldn't suffer the witch to live,</i>

01:19:59.733 --> 01:20:01.734
<i>so I slayed her.</i>

01:20:49.282 --> 01:20:51.350
You killed her?

01:20:51.352 --> 01:20:55.322
I had a moral obligation
to protect my family.

01:20:57.424 --> 01:20:59.958
If I'd just acted sooner,

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:03.227
done what I knew in my heart was right,

01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:07.700
maybe... maybe I-I could have saved her.

01:21:09.269 --> 01:21:11.169
But it was too late.

01:21:11.171 --> 01:21:14.239
Lord, hear all good prayers for us.

01:21:14.241 --> 01:21:17.743
For Jesus' sake. Amen.

01:21:17.745 --> 01:21:21.846
<i>Millarca had already fed
upon your mother's blood.</i>

01:21:21.848 --> 01:21:25.918
<i>And your mother not only allowed it,</i>

01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:28.186
<i>she'd enjoyed it.</i>

01:21:28.188 --> 01:21:31.457
Her blood, her soul...

01:21:31.459 --> 01:21:34.293
was poisoned.

01:21:34.295 --> 01:21:36.227
All I could do was...

01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:39.731
keep her from spreading
the evil to anyone else.

01:21:39.733 --> 01:21:42.400
<i>I kept her under a tight rein.</i>

01:21:42.402 --> 01:21:47.372
<i>I dedicated myself to
watching over the two of you,</i>

01:21:47.374 --> 01:21:50.374
<i>searching for signs of blood...</i>

01:21:50.376 --> 01:21:52.477
<i>her blood...</i>

01:21:52.479 --> 01:21:57.749
<i>and yours...</i>

01:21:57.751 --> 01:21:59.885
<i>waiting for Millarca
or someone like her...</i>

01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:03.989
<i>to come back, looking for us.</i>

01:22:03.991 --> 01:22:06.158
<i>And sure enough,</i>

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:08.562
<i>she did.</i>

01:22:11.831 --> 01:22:17.235
Now you're old enough to know
what I done and why I did it...

01:22:17.237 --> 01:22:20.271
and, if that girl comes
up into this room tonight,

01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:22.841
what it means.

01:22:22.843 --> 01:22:25.010
What it m-means?

01:22:25.012 --> 01:22:28.480
It means that she's like her mother.

01:22:28.482 --> 01:22:32.251
And what I done to her mother,

01:22:32.253 --> 01:22:35.887
I gotta do the same thing to her.

01:22:35.889 --> 01:22:37.388
Don't, Daddy. Please.

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.091
She'll come.

01:22:39.093 --> 01:22:41.959
Wait and see if she don't.

01:22:41.961 --> 01:22:43.529
Please, Daddy.

01:22:43.531 --> 01:22:46.532
Please give me a chance to explain.

01:22:46.534 --> 01:22:48.300
You don't understand.

01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:53.271
Daddy, please. Sh-She never hurt me.

01:22:53.273 --> 01:22:56.008
She never hurt me.

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:38.304
Laura?

01:25:53.019 --> 01:25:55.087
Laura?

01:25:55.089 --> 01:25:57.424
Carmilla, no!

01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:05.230
Motherfucker.

01:26:05.232 --> 01:26:08.535
Carmilla, no.

01:26:09.635 --> 01:26:13.204
No, Carmilla, no. You
gotta get out of here.

01:26:13.206 --> 01:26:15.673
- You gotta get out of here.
- No. You're coming with me.

01:26:15.675 --> 01:26:19.310
- I'm not taking off without you. I'm taking you with me.
- No, I can't go!

01:26:19.312 --> 01:26:22.547
- Shh! Stop!
- No! No! Please!

01:26:22.549 --> 01:26:25.784
- Listen...
- Get out of here.

01:26:25.786 --> 01:26:28.220
No! Go! I want you to go! No!

01:26:28.222 --> 01:26:30.622
Stop. Stop.

01:26:30.624 --> 01:26:34.458
You gotta get out of here.

01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:38.430
I'm fine. He won't come.
He's not gonna hurt me.

01:26:38.432 --> 01:26:41.099
Come on, Laura.

01:26:41.101 --> 01:26:45.037
You just... You have to leave. Okay?

01:26:46.339 --> 01:26:49.775
You gotta go.

01:26:49.777 --> 01:26:53.412
I can't come with you.

01:26:53.414 --> 01:26:57.416
You don't have to ever
come back here again.

01:26:59.452 --> 01:27:01.586
Why can't you just go?

01:27:01.588 --> 01:27:04.388
Please!

01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:07.324
Go! Go! Get out of here!

01:27:07.326 --> 01:27:10.162
I don't want you here! Go!

01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:13.097
I don't want to go! I don't
love you! You have to leave!

01:27:13.099 --> 01:27:15.467
- That's not true!
- Look at me, Carmilla.

01:27:15.469 --> 01:27:20.407
You have to leave. Go.
I don't want you here.

01:27:24.478 --> 01:27:27.147
Carmilla, please.

01:27:28.182 --> 01:27:31.418
Please.

01:27:33.454 --> 01:27:36.320
You've gotta go!

01:27:36.322 --> 01:27:39.356
You <i>have</i> to go!

01:27:39.358 --> 01:27:42.593
- Carmilla, please go!
- No!

01:27:42.595 --> 01:27:46.530
No!

01:27:46.532 --> 01:27:48.300
You have to go.

01:27:48.302 --> 01:27:51.170
Please.

01:28:07.787 --> 01:28:10.689
He killed your mother.

01:28:13.494 --> 01:28:17.296
He's gonna kill you too.

01:28:59.339 --> 01:29:02.806
Daddy, no!

01:29:14.220 --> 01:29:17.321
Die, you witch.

01:30:01.401 --> 01:30:03.769
No, Daddy.

01:30:13.981 --> 01:30:16.347
F... Fuck... you.

01:30:16.349 --> 01:30:19.419
Fuck you.

01:30:20.554 --> 01:30:25.390
Sh-She hurt me bad, Laura. You need to
get the police and bring 'em back out here.

01:30:25.392 --> 01:30:27.492
They'll settle all this.

01:30:27.494 --> 01:30:30.863
- Go on now.
- Carmilla? Carmilla?

01:30:33.767 --> 01:30:36.503
Oh, shit.

01:30:45.012 --> 01:30:48.980
There she goes.

01:30:54.821 --> 01:30:57.588
You look so pretty like that.

01:31:09.335 --> 01:31:12.002
I bet that hurts, don't it?

01:31:12.004 --> 01:31:14.640
Yeah.

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:29.622
You're losing a lot of blood there.

01:31:31.857 --> 01:31:34.426
It'd be a shame to...

01:31:34.428 --> 01:31:37.664
just to black out or somethin'.

01:31:39.765 --> 01:31:43.570
That's right. Go to sleep.

01:32:15.869 --> 01:32:18.838
Mommy loves you.
