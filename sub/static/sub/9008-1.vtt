<b>03 Omen III The Final Conflict - Horror
1981 [H246-mp4] Subtitles English.</b>

03:35.751 --> 03:37.836
This way.

04:12.913 --> 04:17.918
<i>50,000 years ago, mankind faced its
first major threat of extinction...</i>

04:18.000 --> 04:21.797
<i>a devastation rocked by
nature: The Ice Age.</i>

04:21.880 --> 04:24.611
<i>It lasted 5,000 years,
rendered four fifths</i>

04:24.612 --> 04:27.094
<i>of the earth's surface
uninhabitable...</i>

04:27.177 --> 04:30.556
<i>and wiped out all but the
hardiest of nature's creations.</i>

04:30.639 --> 04:33.725
<i>One of these few was man.</i>

04:33.809 --> 04:38.272
<i>From that devastation dawned
a new age - and a new hope.</i>

04:38.355 --> 04:44.153
<i>Phoenix-like, man arose from the frozen
wilderness and set forth upon his dream.</i>

04:44.236 --> 04:47.823
<i>Mankind has endured many
catastrophes since then...</i>

04:47.906 --> 04:51.243
<i>but none so grave as the
one which faces him today.</i>

04:51.326 --> 04:55.873
<i>The economic crisis of the past decade has
brought inflation, famine and chaos...</i>

04:55.956 --> 04:58.125
<i>to every corner of the globe.</i>

04:58.208 --> 05:03.297
<i>Some label it the Great Recession.
Others are calling it Armageddon...</i>

05:03.380 --> 05:07.176
<i>that final upheaval of the world
foretold by the prophets of old.</i>

05:07.259 --> 05:11.680
<i>But amid all the pessimism, one voice
rings out its faith in the future:</i>

05:11.763 --> 05:16.351
<i>Thorn, the world's leading light
in building a new tomorrow.</i>

05:17.978 --> 05:20.772
Trite, rhetorical...

05:20.856 --> 05:23.859
clichÃ©d, inane.

05:24.318 --> 05:27.070
Viewers don't pay much
attention to that, Damien.

05:27.362 --> 05:32.534
No, you're right. And there won't be
much attention to that bullshit either.

05:32.618 --> 05:36.246
I said I wanted action, not
words. I wanna see Thorn at work.

05:36.330 --> 05:40.834
A thousand starving kids clamouring
for a bellyful of Thorn soya.

05:40.918 --> 05:43.712
Thorn medical teams,
construction, engineering.

05:43.796 --> 05:48.675
Instead of which, you spend half the
commercial giving us a third-grade version...

05:48.759 --> 05:51.261
of the history of the Ice Age.

05:53.764 --> 05:56.642
Do we have footage of the
Australian drought relief?

05:56.725 --> 06:01.313
Sure, but nothing new, and most
of it's been seen on TV already.

06:02.523 --> 06:06.735
We'll find you something. In the
meantime, go with the old commercial.

06:06.819 --> 06:09.530
I don't want that one used.

06:10.989 --> 06:15.244
- What have we got coming up?
- Botswana next week, then the Aswan Dam.

06:15.327 --> 06:17.265
Can we get a film
unit to Botswana?

06:17.266 --> 06:19.957
Sure, but no relief unit
till after the coup.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.481
No one's sure how long
that's gonna take.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.212
All right. It'll have
to be the Aswan Dam.

06:25.295 --> 06:27.923
Have a film unit there
when it goes. Make

06:27.924 --> 06:30.551
sure they give our
relief units coverage.

06:30.634 --> 06:33.720
Don't let the Red Cross
beat them to it.

06:33.804 --> 06:36.473
Why don't <i>you</i> go? Now that
would be a real coup.

06:36.557 --> 06:40.811
Damien Thorn supervising
relief work in person!

06:40.894 --> 06:43.313
No, I've got to stay here.

06:43.397 --> 06:47.234
- What for?
- To be on hand when the president calls me.

06:49.319 --> 06:54.324
He's, uh, gonna offer me the post
of ambassador to Great Britain.

06:54.408 --> 06:58.453
- I beg your pardon?
- Are you familiar with the Book of Hebron?

06:58.537 --> 07:02.541
No, I don't know anything
about the Book of Hebron.

07:02.624 --> 07:05.842
It's in the Apocrypha.
One of the more

07:05.843 --> 07:09.381
obscure backwaters of
the Septuagint Bible.

07:11.175 --> 07:14.303
"And it shall come to pass
that in the end days...

07:14.386 --> 07:19.266
the beast shall reign one hundred
score and thirty days and nights."

07:19.349 --> 07:23.437
"And the faithful shall
cry unto the Lord:

07:23.520 --> 07:26.857
Wherefore art thou
in the day of evil?"

07:26.940 --> 07:30.152
"And the Lord shall
hear their prayers."

07:30.235 --> 07:34.364
"And out of the angel isle he
shall bring forth a deliverer..."

07:34.448 --> 07:39.161
a holy lamb of God who shall
do battle with the beast...

07:40.787 --> 07:43.457
"and shall destroy him."

07:44.708 --> 07:48.754
"The beast shall reign one hundred
score and thirty days and nights"...

07:48.837 --> 07:51.590
is another way of
saying seven years.

07:51.673 --> 07:54.676
That's the time I've
been head of Thorn.

07:54.760 --> 07:58.514
"And out of the angel isle he
shall bring forth a deliverer."

07:58.597 --> 08:03.227
The "angel isle" - the original
Latin has <i>"ex insula angelorum".</i>

08:04.019 --> 08:06.230
England.

08:06.313 --> 08:08.106
The Second Coming.

08:08.273 --> 08:11.777
Only it won't be the
beast that is destroyed.

08:14.947 --> 08:16.740
It'll be the Nazarene.

08:16.824 --> 08:18.852
Damien, you said you
were gonna be offered

08:18.853 --> 08:20.786
the post of ambassador
to Great Britain.

08:20.869 --> 08:23.831
What about our
present ambassador?

10:38.257 --> 10:40.342
Afternoon, sir.

10:49.268 --> 10:51.478
Good afternoon, Mr. Ambassador.

10:51.562 --> 10:55.482
Good afternoon, Mr. Ambassador. I
just had Mr. Sears on the line.

10:55.566 --> 10:59.486
- No calls from anyone.
- He said it was urgent and I was to remind...

11:41.612 --> 11:44.239
- Press office.
<i>- This is the ambassador.</i>

11:44.323 --> 11:46.909
<i>I want a press conference.
Three o'clock.</i>

13:24.256 --> 13:26.133
Come in.

13:36.351 --> 13:38.270
Oh, my God!

13:46.236 --> 13:48.322
I know that.

13:49.198 --> 13:53.285
No. I'm not giving out any statements
- to him or to anyone else.

13:53.368 --> 13:56.163
It'll only make matters worse.

13:56.246 --> 13:59.958
Make sure that the cable
is non-committal as well.

14:00.292 --> 14:01.960
Yeah.

14:02.044 --> 14:04.755
Let me see it
before you send it.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.260
Gee. Can you believe that?

14:12.554 --> 14:15.891
Some sons of bitches from the
Egyptian opposition party...

14:15.974 --> 14:21.563
want us to endorse their condemnation
of Israel for blowing up the Aswan Dam.

14:21.647 --> 14:24.316
How the hell do <i>we</i> know
Israel's responsible?

14:24.399 --> 14:27.653
- My guess is it's the work of the NLF.
- Who?

14:27.736 --> 14:30.906
The Nubian Liberation Front
- a quasi-Marxist outfit.

14:30.989 --> 14:33.170
They've had a gripe
against Cairo since the

14:33.171 --> 14:35.202
'60s, when the High
Aswan Dam was built.

14:35.285 --> 14:37.803
They claim that it
submerged 50 per cent of

14:37.804 --> 14:40.207
their homeland, which,
of course, it did.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.376
Until now.

14:43.669 --> 14:46.088
How'd you get this information?

14:46.171 --> 14:50.884
One of our Thorn relief teams - they were
on the scene ahead of the Egyptians.

14:51.552 --> 14:53.887
I wanna take a look at that.

14:53.971 --> 14:57.141
It's quite, uh,
unofficial, of course.

14:57.975 --> 15:01.137
I don't have to point out
to you that... if we

15:01.138 --> 15:04.231
can prove it had nothing
to do with Israel...

15:04.314 --> 15:08.026
we could be averting one
mother of a major flare-up.

15:08.110 --> 15:11.473
I'll have to check it
myself. I wouldn't want

15:11.474 --> 15:14.616
to feed the White House
false information.

15:15.659 --> 15:18.245
As to the other matter...

15:18.328 --> 15:21.331
I'm afraid I can't
accept the post.

15:21.415 --> 15:24.031
If I were ambassador
to Great Britain, I'd

15:24.032 --> 15:26.587
have to relinquish my
control over Thorn.

15:26.670 --> 15:30.132
Hell, no! We can take
care of that for you.

15:30.674 --> 15:35.846
- It <i>is</i> against the law.
- Then we'll just have to bend it a little.

15:35.929 --> 15:39.224
But there are two
other conditions.

15:39.308 --> 15:41.393
What?

15:42.478 --> 15:44.563
Well, first...

15:45.355 --> 15:51.236
it could only be for two years, because
of running for the Senate in '84.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.073
And second, I'd want the
presidency of the Youth Council.

15:57.034 --> 16:01.497
- I've already promised that to Foster.
- I realize it's a problem.

16:19.515 --> 16:22.100
The NI... what?

16:22.184 --> 16:24.895
The Nubian Liberation Front.

16:32.694 --> 16:34.780
- Craig.
<i>- Yes, Mr. President.</i>

16:35.706 --> 16:38.292
I've just appointed Mr.
Damien Thorn as our

16:38.293 --> 16:40.702
new ambassador to the
Court of St James.

16:40.786 --> 16:43.831
Have Eisenberg prepare a press
release to that effect.

16:43.914 --> 16:46.208
<i>Right away, Mr. President.</i>

16:55.300 --> 16:57.594
- Craig.
<i>- Yes, Mr. President.</i>

16:59.513 --> 17:02.766
Add to that that I've also
appointed Mr. Thorn...

17:02.850 --> 17:07.563
as president of the United
Nations Youth Council.

17:07.646 --> 17:11.275
<i>- But I thought...</i>
- Just do it... will you?

17:17.906 --> 17:20.200
Well, Damien...

17:20.284 --> 17:23.829
your father would have
been very proud of you.

17:26.248 --> 17:28.625
I appreciate your
sentiments, sir.

17:33.046 --> 17:37.968
Cassiopeia. Right ascension.
One hour, 16 minutes, 12.

17:38.051 --> 17:41.013
Select declination
at 22 degrees...

17:41.096 --> 17:43.307
on an eight-by-four ratio.

17:43.390 --> 17:47.060
Super grid R-3 at
eight diagonal.

17:47.144 --> 17:50.939
- Eight diagonal.
- Increase focal length to max.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.403
- Hold. OK, Tony. Hard copy.
- Right.

18:05.454 --> 18:09.625
Can I see the cell
from June 1953?

18:10.000 --> 18:10.709
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:10.709 --> 18:14.880
<i>(Tony)</i> June 1953...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.880 --> 18:15.631
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:15.631 --> 18:17.716
Right here.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.716 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:25.098 --> 18:28.060
And... December 1928.

18:38.070 --> 18:42.574
- Well, what would <i>you</i> say?
- I'd say I was dreaming.

18:42.658 --> 18:47.204
- And the rate of acceleration?
- A couple of thousand parsecs, minimum!

18:47.287 --> 18:50.035
I'd say we're in for
one hell of a bang.

18:50.036 --> 18:52.918
Oh, no. An alignment,
not a collision.

18:53.001 --> 18:57.756
Let's transfer to the simulator, see if we
can't get an accurate schedule predict.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.925
Right.

19:02.803 --> 19:05.305
Whenever you're ready.

19:38.922 --> 19:42.384
<i>Verbo sanctificatur omnia...</i>

19:42.468 --> 19:46.763
<i>benedictionem tuam effunde
super scuti istas.</i>

19:47.473 --> 19:49.683
<i>Per Christum dominum nostrum.</i>

19:50.184 --> 19:52.269
<i>Amen.</i>

19:58.108 --> 20:00.444
Oh, blessed Saviour...

20:00.527 --> 20:03.197
who hath, through
the confession...

20:03.280 --> 20:06.950
of thy departed servant
Father Spiletto...

20:07.034 --> 20:12.748
revealed unto us the identity of
the Antichrist here on earth.

20:13.081 --> 20:16.752
Grant us thy strength
and guidance...

20:16.835 --> 20:19.421
in our holy mission...

20:19.505 --> 20:23.509
that we may rid the world
of Damien Thorn...

20:23.592 --> 20:28.722
and thus ensure the safety
of thy Second Coming.

20:30.390 --> 20:32.392
Oh, Lord...

20:32.476 --> 20:37.231
bless these seven sacred
knives from Megiddo...

20:37.314 --> 20:42.903
which thou hast seen fit
to return unto us...

20:42.986 --> 20:46.907
that they may serve
their holy purpose...

20:47.324 --> 20:51.662
and destroy the
Prince of Darkness...

20:51.745 --> 20:57.209
even as he seeketh to
destroy thy child of light.

21:06.718 --> 21:10.722
I now call upon each of
you to come forward...

21:10.806 --> 21:14.518
and arm yourselves in
the name of the Lord.

21:15.519 --> 21:17.604
Brother Martin.

21:22.734 --> 21:24.820
Brother Paulo.

21:32.452 --> 21:37.708
Each of us must pray to our Lord
in the silence of his own soul.

21:37.791 --> 21:42.838
Since we are prepared to lay down our lives
in the pursuit of this enterprise...

21:42.921 --> 21:47.301
we must seek final
absolution from God now...

21:47.384 --> 21:51.805
lest we be denied the redemption
of the blessed last sacrament...

21:51.889 --> 21:53.974
at the moment of death.

21:54.057 --> 22:00.314
Above all, we must ask God to grant
us courage, guidance and strength...

22:00.397 --> 22:05.861
as we prepare to do battle with
Satan and his son, the Antichrist.

22:05.944 --> 22:12.409
The exact hour of our Lord's Second
Coming, for which centuries have wept...

22:12.493 --> 22:16.872
has now been revealed to us
by signs in the heavens.

22:16.955 --> 22:22.836
It is imperative that the destruction of
the Antichrist takes place before then...

22:22.920 --> 22:26.423
and we have but a short time
in which to carry it out.

22:27.299 --> 22:33.013
My brothers, remember that these
seven daggers and ourselves...

22:33.096 --> 22:37.810
are all that stand between the son
of Satan and the Son of God...

22:37.893 --> 22:40.103
for they alone can destroy him.

22:50.197 --> 22:52.950
- Can't quite place it, can you?
- No.

22:54.034 --> 22:56.806
Waiter, let me have a
look at the label on

22:56.807 --> 22:59.706
the bottle of wine we're
drinking, will you?

23:08.382 --> 23:10.551
Is he really only 32?

23:10.634 --> 23:15.180
No idea. Shouldn't be surprised.
Americans always seem to think...

23:15.264 --> 23:19.643
they can run before they can
walk. Like their wine, what?

23:20.853 --> 23:25.274
The answer is yes. He's the youngest
ambassador ever appointed by the president.

23:25.357 --> 23:29.278
- Are you part of his staff?
- I'm his private secretary, Harvey Dean.

23:29.361 --> 23:32.197
- Kate Reynolds, British television.
- My wife Barbara.

23:32.281 --> 23:34.366
- How do you do?
- We're fine.

23:35.784 --> 23:38.871
- Lafite-Thorn.
- Must have bought the bugger out!

23:38.954 --> 23:43.584
Mm. Amazing what they can make
with soya beans these days.

23:43.667 --> 23:48.130
- Would you like to meet the ambassador?
- Oh, yes. Yes, I would. Thank you.

23:48.213 --> 23:50.299
Be back in a jiffy.

23:50.841 --> 23:52.843
- Good evening, Mrs. Dean.
- Hello.

23:52.926 --> 23:55.971
- When is the happy event?
- Next week, I hope.

23:57.598 --> 24:01.018
Damien. I'd like you
to meet Kate Reynolds.

24:01.019 --> 24:04.438
Miss Reynolds works for
British television.

24:04.771 --> 24:09.943
She has her own weekly news show.
It's called <i>The World in Vision.</i>

24:10.027 --> 24:13.405
<i>- In Focus.</i>
- Oh, excuse me. <i>The World in Focus.</i>

24:13.489 --> 24:16.700
Or out of focus, as
the case may be.

24:17.159 --> 24:22.498
How do you do, Miss Reynolds? The
Barbara Walters of British television?

24:22.581 --> 24:26.919
On my salary? They don't call us the British
Broadcasting Charity for nothing(!)

24:27.002 --> 24:29.719
Well, that makes two of
us. I'm in the charity

24:29.720 --> 24:32.090
business as well. What
can I do for you?

24:32.174 --> 24:36.512
Actually, I'd like to talk about doing
an interview with you sometime...

24:36.595 --> 24:38.967
concentrating on your
views on youth. I've

24:38.968 --> 24:41.133
heard a lot about them
from my son Peter.

24:41.225 --> 24:44.895
He's only 12, but your ideas have
made a big impression on him.

24:44.978 --> 24:47.064
Excuse me.

24:48.190 --> 24:50.526
The Israeli
ambassador has to go.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.770
Of course. I'd be pleased
to talk to you. Give,

24:55.771 --> 24:58.033
um, Harvey a call.
He'll arrange a time.

24:58.116 --> 25:02.412
- How about Sunday?
- Well, Sundays I usually spend with Peter.

25:02.496 --> 25:05.833
Fine. Bring Peter
along too. Excuse me.

25:26.436 --> 25:29.148
Come on, you two!
You'll get wet!

25:45.080 --> 25:47.583
Mummy, look what
Damien's given me!

25:47.666 --> 25:50.419
- No, you can't.
- He can. He just did.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.922
It's safer with him. If
I have a collision...

25:54.006 --> 25:57.634
we might have some sort of
international crisis on our hands.

25:57.718 --> 26:00.053
I'm not sure you should
spoil him so much.

26:00.137 --> 26:03.140
Well, to tell you the truth,
<i>he's</i> been spoiling <i>me.</i>

26:03.223 --> 26:06.643
It's not every day you get the
chance to be a boy again.

26:08.270 --> 26:10.355
Well...

26:10.439 --> 26:12.733
English weather.

26:13.484 --> 26:17.946
<i>- (Peter)</i> Go on, dog. Go and get it.
<i>- (Damien)</i> Tell me about Peter's father.

26:18.030 --> 26:20.407
<i>(Kate)</i> He died just
after Peter was born.

26:20.491 --> 26:24.953
- Have <i>you</i> never thought of getting married?
- No. I'm too much of a sceptic.

26:25.037 --> 26:29.374
- Oh, yes?
- Besides, I've never really had the time.

26:31.919 --> 26:35.172
Peter's always wanted
me to buy him a dog.

26:35.255 --> 26:38.342
Well, you should. Dogs and
boys go great together.

26:38.425 --> 26:41.512
We've had one of these dogs in
the family since I was a kid.

26:41.595 --> 26:45.974
- They used to march with the Roman army.
- Did they?

26:46.058 --> 26:48.560
They're as old as sin.

26:53.023 --> 26:56.401
- Feel like some lunch?
- Good idea.

26:56.485 --> 26:59.501
Probably realized my
favourite subject is

26:59.502 --> 27:02.449
me, not only because
I'm very beautiful...

27:02.533 --> 27:04.243
I am beautiful!

27:07.871 --> 27:11.124
People from all over the
world came for our actors...

27:11.208 --> 27:15.045
but where are the new ones gonna
train if we haven't got any stages?

27:15.129 --> 27:19.800
And the reason we haven't got stages is
cos people are not going to the theatre!

27:19.883 --> 27:21.802
They are watching television.

27:21.885 --> 27:24.421
You're sitting in a
bar, and at 11 o'clock

27:24.422 --> 27:27.015
they say "You have 10
minutes to drink up."

27:27.432 --> 27:32.062
You've paid a fortune for that drink
and they throw you out in the streets.

27:32.146 --> 27:35.004
"The day of Christ is
at hand" wrote St Paul

27:35.005 --> 27:37.734
in his second letter
to the Thessalonians.

27:37.818 --> 27:40.195
"Yet let no man be deceived..."

27:40.279 --> 27:44.867
for that day shall not come until
the man of sins is revealed...

27:44.950 --> 27:48.495
"the son of perdition,
the Antichrist."

27:48.579 --> 27:50.747
"And be not deceived by him...

27:50.831 --> 27:55.961
for Satan himself is transformed
into an angel of light."

27:56.044 --> 27:59.475
The hour of Christ's
Second Coming draws nigh.

27:59.476 --> 28:02.176
The prophecies
fulfilled one by one.

28:02.259 --> 28:06.972
Right now, my friends, in the
constellation of Cassiopeia...

28:07.055 --> 28:12.561
a holy trinity of stars is converging
to herald our Lord's Second Coming.

28:12.644 --> 28:17.983
"Rejoice, you heavens and you that dwell
in them" commands St John in Revelation.

28:18.066 --> 28:20.662
"But woe to you, sea and
earth, for the devil"

28:20.663 --> 28:22.863
hath come down to you
in great fury...

28:22.946 --> 28:27.743
"knowing that his time is short, and the
Prince of Darkness shall be mighty."

28:27.826 --> 28:31.079
"And he shall flourish
and destroy the mighty."

28:31.163 --> 28:35.834
"And he shall cause craft
to prosper in his hands."

28:35.918 --> 28:38.837
"And by peace shall
he destroy many!"

28:42.925 --> 28:46.595
I followed them through the crowd,
but couldn't get close enough.

28:46.678 --> 28:49.640
He was with a woman and
a boy of about 11.

28:49.723 --> 28:54.603
- Who was the woman?
- She's a television interviewer.

28:55.145 --> 28:58.649
I asked someone who went up
to her for an autograph.

28:59.107 --> 29:03.403
Kate Reynolds. She apparently
is quite some celebrity.

29:03.487 --> 29:06.031
- And the boy?
- Probably her son.

29:06.114 --> 29:10.828
Please, Father, let it be me. Let me be the
bait to flush him out and destroy him.

29:10.911 --> 29:13.747
Thorn and I have made
contact eye to eye.

29:13.748 --> 29:16.583
That is exactly why
it cannot be you.

29:17.334 --> 29:19.586
We have to strike him off guard.

29:19.670 --> 29:24.842
Yet the target must be still... for
the marksman to be sure of his aim.

29:25.843 --> 29:28.345
A sitting target...

29:29.138 --> 29:33.767
- A sleeping target?
- No. His residence is guarded day and night.

29:33.851 --> 29:37.104
- How about the embassy?
- Impossible.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.191
<i>There's</i> our sitting target.

29:41.775 --> 29:43.861
Where?

29:44.653 --> 29:47.079
<i>(Kate) The Israeli
government has denied</i>

29:47.080 --> 29:49.741
<i>responsibility for the
Aswan Dam disaster...</i>

29:49.825 --> 29:53.579
<i>which has so far claimed the lives
of over 50,000 Egyptians...</i>

29:53.662 --> 29:58.333
<i>though many fear that the final death
toll may reach twice that number.</i>

29:58.417 --> 30:00.630
<i>Already typhoid has
broken out among the</i>

30:00.631 --> 30:03.005
<i>country's thousands of
homeless refugees...</i>

30:03.088 --> 30:07.718
It's OK. I'll do it myself. <i>And a
major epidemic seems unavoidable.</i>

30:07.801 --> 30:12.389
<i>The Egyptian government has revealed
that Thorn is supplying soya...</i>

30:15.309 --> 30:17.846
<i>At the centre of Thorn's
global operations is</i>

30:17.847 --> 30:20.272
<i>a man who has become a
legend for his time:</i>

30:20.355 --> 30:22.399
<i>Damien Thorn.</i>

30:22.483 --> 30:27.029
Did you see that woman? It's not a
woman. It's a guy. It's a faggot!

30:27.112 --> 30:32.159
- Dressed up like a woman. It's a faggot!
- They're all God's children, Harvey.

30:34.036 --> 30:38.665
In a career that's already being compared
to that of the late John F Kennedy.

30:38.749 --> 30:43.070
After majoring at Yale, Damien Thorn
came to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar...

30:43.080 --> 30:45.424
where he captained
the Oxford eight to

30:45.425 --> 30:47.935
victory and won the
Westchester Cup at polo.

30:48.091 --> 30:52.137
In 1971 he took over his uncle's
business, Thorn Industries...

30:52.221 --> 30:56.558
and in seven years has turned it into
the world's largest multinational...

30:56.642 --> 31:00.521
producing everything from nuclear
armaments to soya bean food products.

31:00.604 --> 31:03.398
And now, at the age of
32, Damien Thorn has...

31:03.482 --> 31:05.567
Are you lost?

31:06.693 --> 31:09.696
You're not connected with
this programme, are you?

31:09.780 --> 31:12.991
- This is stage eight, isn't it?
- Four.

31:13.075 --> 31:17.162
- Studio eight's the next one along.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

31:19.498 --> 31:22.626
A brilliant career for one
so young, Mr. Ambassador.

31:23.085 --> 31:26.547
Not when you remember that
Alexander the Great...

31:26.630 --> 31:29.466
was commanding the
Macedonian army at 16.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.176
Of course, that's how
many people view you

31:32.177 --> 31:34.680
as a sort of 20th-century
Alexander...

31:34.763 --> 31:37.567
leading the world out
of the doldrums of

31:37.568 --> 31:40.435
recession into the golden
era of prosperity.

31:40.519 --> 31:46.066
- You've seen too many of our commercials.
- But it is the image you put across.

31:46.150 --> 31:50.737
Well, the image of Thorn as a corporation,
not a personal image of myself.

31:50.821 --> 31:56.034
But yes, it's true. I certainly have
tremendous optimism for the future...

31:56.118 --> 31:59.288
and I wanna see Thorn play a
major part in achieving it.

31:59.371 --> 32:01.623
You have an interest
in young people.

32:01.707 --> 32:05.711
What are your plans as president of
the United Nations Youth Council?

32:05.794 --> 32:10.466
A great many things, but I think
the most important task I have...

32:10.549 --> 32:14.803
is to help young people gain a more
prominent role in world affairs...

32:14.887 --> 32:18.849
than the one we currently afford
them, or rather deny them.

32:18.932 --> 32:24.271
I mean, what is this arrogance that makes
us think that we know better than them?

32:24.354 --> 32:26.965
We call them immature
and naive. "Wait till

32:26.966 --> 32:29.576
you're grown-up. Then
we'll listen to you."

32:29.610 --> 32:33.115
What we really mean is "Wait
till you're grown old."

32:33.116 --> 32:35.407
Then you'll think
the way we do."

32:35.491 --> 32:40.370
And so youth stands aside because it has
no other choice, and we set to work.

32:40.454 --> 32:47.127
We... we ply them with our values, we
indoctrinate them with our mediocrity.

32:47.211 --> 32:51.173
Until finally they emerge from
their brainwashing education...

32:51.256 --> 32:54.510
as so-called fully
fledged citizens...

32:54.593 --> 32:58.388
clipped, impotent,
and above all safe.

32:59.389 --> 33:01.600
Damien!

33:24.790 --> 33:27.376
Grab one of these
extinguishers! Come on!

34:08.333 --> 34:10.418
<i>(man)</i> God!

34:27.728 --> 34:30.022
I need a drink.

34:30.981 --> 34:34.193
I keep seeing that face. How
about you? You want one?

34:34.275 --> 34:37.196
That was an
assassination attempt.

34:38.655 --> 34:40.949
What?

34:42.284 --> 34:44.995
I found this on
the studio floor.

34:46.663 --> 34:49.792
This is one of the seven
knives of Megiddo -

34:49.793 --> 34:52.920
the only thing on earth...
that can kill me.

34:56.840 --> 35:00.010
They were discovered in
Israel when I was a child.

35:00.093 --> 35:06.433
An archaeologist, Bugenhagen, found them.
He gave them to my father to destroy me.

35:06.517 --> 35:09.186
But I had the love of my
true father to protect me.

35:09.269 --> 35:11.897
You said there were seven.
Where are the other six?

35:11.980 --> 35:14.691
That's what we have to find out.

35:16.527 --> 35:21.949
Someone must have dug them up from
the old Thorn Museum in Chicago.

35:22.032 --> 35:25.369
And now they're in the hands
of someone who knows who I am.

35:25.452 --> 35:28.789
And whoever knows who you are
must also know the prophecy.

35:28.872 --> 35:32.793
Get hold of Buher right away. Tell him
to get to Chicago as soon as he can.

35:35.420 --> 35:39.424
Excuse me, sir. The Harley Street Hospital
has just telephoned for Mr. Dean.

35:39.508 --> 35:43.720
Oh, Barbara. I... She went
into labour this afternoon.

35:44.805 --> 35:46.557
Uh...

35:46.640 --> 35:48.767
Can I borrow your car?

35:48.851 --> 35:53.397
Call by the embassy first. Get
hold of Buher right away.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.983
Are you OK, Damien?

36:07.953 --> 36:11.415
"In a statement issued from
the American embassy..."

36:11.498 --> 36:16.086
Ambassador Thorn stated that he was
satisfied that there was no connection...

36:16.170 --> 36:19.840
"between himself and the
unfortunate victim."

36:19.923 --> 36:22.259
Thorn knows it was no accident.

36:22.718 --> 36:27.681
Our priority now is to locate the
holy child as soon as he's born.

36:28.724 --> 36:31.643
Brother Simeon and
Brother Antonio...

36:31.727 --> 36:37.608
I want you to make ready to come with me
tonight to ascertain his birthplace...

36:37.691 --> 36:40.402
for the hour draws near.

36:40.486 --> 36:44.948
The rest of you must wait until we
return before deciding how we proceed.

36:45.282 --> 36:50.621
Our efforts must be strictly
coordinated next time.

36:50.704 --> 36:53.540
We can't afford to
make a second mistake.

37:07.221 --> 37:09.014
- George.
- Yes, Mr. Ambassador?

37:09.097 --> 37:10.000
- I won't be needing anything else tonight.
- Right you are, sir. Good night.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.019
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
- I won't be needing anything else tonight.
- Right you are, sir. Good night.

37:14.019 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:55.727 --> 37:57.855
<i>(Damien)</i> My father...

37:57.938 --> 38:01.900
lord of silence, supreme
god of desolation...

38:01.984 --> 38:06.155
who mankind reviles yet
aches to embrace...

38:07.447 --> 38:13.871
strengthen my purpose to save the world
from a second ordeal of Jesus Christ...

38:13.954 --> 38:17.541
and his grubby, mundane creed.

38:18.876 --> 38:21.587
2,000 years have been enough.

38:24.214 --> 38:28.302
Show man instead the
raptures of thy kingdom.

38:28.385 --> 38:31.847
Infuse in him the
grandeur of melancholy...

38:31.930 --> 38:34.641
the divinity of loneliness...

38:34.725 --> 38:37.227
the purity of evil...

38:37.311 --> 38:41.482
the paradise... of pain.

38:44.026 --> 38:47.483
What perverted imagination
has fed man the lie

38:47.484 --> 38:50.866
that hell festers in the
bowels of the earth?

38:50.949 --> 38:55.078
There is only one hell - the leaden
monotony of human existence.

38:55.996 --> 38:58.707
There is only one heaven.

38:59.458 --> 39:03.545
The ecstasy of my
father's kingdom.

39:09.593 --> 39:14.389
Nazarene charlatan, what
can <i>you</i> offer humanity?

39:14.473 --> 39:19.520
Since the hour you vomited forth
from the gaping wound of a woman...

39:19.603 --> 39:23.148
you've done nothing but drown
man's soaring desires...

39:23.232 --> 39:26.652
in a deluge of
sanctimonious morality.

39:27.903 --> 39:30.885
You've inflamed the
pubertal mind of youth

39:30.886 --> 39:33.867
with your repellent
dogma of original sin.

39:33.951 --> 39:38.872
And now you're resolved on denying
him ultimate joy beyond death...

39:38.956 --> 39:41.458
by destroying me!

39:45.879 --> 39:48.590
But you will fail, Nazarene.

39:49.675 --> 39:52.386
As you have always failed.

39:55.931 --> 39:59.059
We were both created
in man's image.

40:01.728 --> 40:05.524
But while you were born
of an impotent god...

40:06.942 --> 40:10.362
I was conceived of a jackal.

40:11.697 --> 40:15.534
Born of Satan, the
desolate one...

40:16.869 --> 40:18.954
the nail...

40:21.832 --> 40:27.921
Your pain on the cross was but a splinter
compared to the agony of my father...

40:28.005 --> 40:30.799
cast out from heaven...

40:30.883 --> 40:33.010
the fallen angel...

40:33.093 --> 40:36.138
banished, reviled...

40:40.142 --> 40:45.772
I would drive deeper the thorns
into your rancid carcass...

40:45.856 --> 40:49.109
you profaner of vices.

40:49.193 --> 40:51.487
Cursed Nazarene.

41:09.087 --> 41:11.173
Satan...

41:11.757 --> 41:14.676
I will avenge thy torment...

41:15.511 --> 41:18.430
by destroying the
Christ for ever.

42:08.147 --> 42:10.816
Father De Carlo,
welcome. Gentlemen.

42:12.025 --> 42:15.320
The simulator has established
the approximate location...

42:15.404 --> 42:18.991
over which the three
stars are to converge.

42:44.057 --> 42:47.978
- How accurate is that?
- To about 50 square kilometres.

42:48.061 --> 42:50.535
Once the alignment has
taken place, we can

42:50.536 --> 42:53.066
narrow it down to the
nearest square meter.

43:13.086 --> 43:17.174
Excuse me, sir. We're
at T minus 500.

43:17.257 --> 43:20.385
The final countdown
is about to start.

43:25.390 --> 43:28.769
There, gentlemen, are
your three stars.

43:28.852 --> 43:32.314
The waiting of 2,000
years... is at an end.

44:53.979 --> 44:56.064
Mr. Ambassador!

44:58.192 --> 45:02.279
Is there any connection between the
accident at the BBC and today's news?

45:02.362 --> 45:05.199
- No.
- What about Schroeder's revelation...

45:05.282 --> 45:08.827
that the Israelis were responsible
for the Aswan Dam disaster?

45:08.911 --> 45:11.469
If it's true, it's a sad
blow to world peace.

45:11.470 --> 45:13.582
Is that an official
condemnation?

45:13.665 --> 45:16.460
I condemn all violence, but
it's too early for that.

45:16.543 --> 45:20.047
The Soviet Union's offered support
to Egypt for retaliation.

45:20.130 --> 45:24.635
- How do you react to that?
- Gentlemen, I have nothing else to say.

45:27.179 --> 45:30.974
Mr. Ambassador, I tried calling you
last night but there was no reply.

45:31.058 --> 45:34.561
Isn't there something we can do
to make up for what happened?

45:34.645 --> 45:37.356
- Like what?
- Well, like, erm...

45:38.398 --> 45:41.693
- Like finishing the interview?
- Well, yes.

45:41.777 --> 45:45.113
All right. But I'd sooner we
did it at my place than yours.

45:45.197 --> 45:48.951
Yours is a little...
dramatic for my taste.

45:50.702 --> 45:53.622
Why not stay on for
dinner afterwards?

45:54.248 --> 45:57.709
- I'd love to.
- All right. I'll have Harvey fix it.

45:57.793 --> 45:59.878
Fine.

46:07.386 --> 46:09.471
No, a boy.

46:09.555 --> 46:11.974
Yeah, he sure is ugly.

46:12.057 --> 46:13.976
Yeah.

46:14.935 --> 46:17.396
All right. Thanks, Paul. Yeah.

46:17.604 --> 46:19.690
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

46:20.440 --> 46:24.945
That was Buher. He just sent over
the NLF report to the White House.

46:25.028 --> 46:28.282
He said it's so full of holes, you
can drive a truck through it.

46:28.365 --> 46:31.243
Thanks for the flowers.
Barbara really appreciated...

46:31.326 --> 46:33.287
And the daggers?

46:33.370 --> 46:36.623
Apparently all seven came up
for auction a few months back.

46:36.707 --> 46:40.945
They were bought by a priest, and he
passed them on to a monastery in Italy.

46:40.946 --> 46:42.004
Subi...

46:42.087 --> 46:45.174
Subiaco. The monastery
of San Benedetto.

46:45.257 --> 46:48.844
Yeah, Subiaco. We've got our
people in Italy working on it.

46:48.927 --> 46:52.598
- Unless something happens, they should...
- It's too late.

46:52.681 --> 46:55.851
They're here in England for
the birth of the Nazarene.

46:56.935 --> 47:00.355
Trying to destroy me
before I destroy them.

47:04.318 --> 47:08.614
He was born last night.
I feel his presence.

47:09.031 --> 47:13.035
Like a virus, a parasite,
feeding on my energy...

47:13.118 --> 47:16.038
trying to drain me of power.

47:17.372 --> 47:20.918
For every day that he
lives and grows...

47:21.001 --> 47:23.712
my force will weaken.

47:27.007 --> 47:29.927
Hide if you must, Nazarene...

47:31.053 --> 47:33.472
but I will hunt you down.

47:42.981 --> 47:47.694
- Why is he just sitting there?
- Waiting for me to follow him.

47:47.778 --> 47:51.573
He must be an idiot if he thinks
you're gonna do something like that.

47:51.657 --> 47:54.125
He knows that's exactly
what I intend to do.

47:54.126 --> 47:56.703
But what if he's got
one of those daggers?

47:57.704 --> 48:00.457
I'll be wasting my
time if he hasn't.

49:34.259 --> 49:37.638
Matteus here. I'm
10 minutes away.

49:37.721 --> 49:41.308
Thorn's about... 500
yards behind me.

51:00.804 --> 51:02.681
Enough!

51:02.764 --> 51:04.850
Enough. It's done.

51:12.816 --> 51:16.612
But it was him! I
saw him! I saw him!

51:16.695 --> 51:20.616
- Sweet Saviour, spare our minds.
- We're possessed!

51:20.699 --> 51:22.784
Spare our minds!

51:39.927 --> 51:42.513
Down there! It's
our only way out!

51:55.776 --> 51:58.987
- It's bricked up!
- It's closed here too.

51:59.321 --> 52:01.323
There is no way out!

52:03.534 --> 52:06.036
We're trapped!

52:32.271 --> 52:35.149
There are still
three daggers left.

52:35.232 --> 52:37.658
But I can't afford to
waste any more time.

52:37.659 --> 52:40.028
The only way to be rid
of the Nazarene...

52:40.112 --> 52:44.491
is to kill every male child in the country
born between midnight and dawn...

52:44.575 --> 52:48.996
on March 24th. How can we be
sure he's in the country?

52:49.079 --> 52:53.500
"And he shall come forth out of the angel
isle." That's what the prophecy says.

52:53.584 --> 52:56.128
One thing pedantic
Christians believe in is

52:56.129 --> 52:58.672
sticking to the letter
of their prophecies.

53:04.136 --> 53:07.306
- How's Barbara?
- Fine.

53:07.389 --> 53:10.601
- And your son?
- Fine. He's fine.

53:10.684 --> 53:14.104
He <i>was</i> born on March
the 23rd, wasn't he?

53:14.688 --> 53:18.859
Yeah, yeah. Sure. He was born 10
minutes before midnight, March 23rd.

53:18.942 --> 53:22.488
<i>(woman)</i> Whenever you're
ready, Mr. Ambassador.

53:24.156 --> 53:26.492
Liquidate the Nazarene.

53:26.575 --> 53:29.077
Me? How?

53:30.078 --> 53:33.123
That's what our people are for.

53:33.207 --> 53:39.463
Now, call a meeting for Sunday. I'll
make my own way there after the hunt.

53:44.802 --> 53:47.554
Chin up, old boy.

54:27.511 --> 54:32.432
Oh, thank you, my dear. I've been waiting
for this drink since the last meet.

54:55.122 --> 54:59.001
Stay close to Susan at the back, and
don't go showing off to Damien.

54:59.084 --> 55:03.130
- Don't worry. You'll still get blooded.
- What does blooded mean?

55:03.213 --> 55:05.466
You know perfectly
well what it means.

55:05.549 --> 55:07.883
If it's your first
hunt and they catch a

55:07.884 --> 55:10.387
fox, they smear blood
all over your cheeks.

55:10.471 --> 55:13.307
- Satisfied?
<i>- (Whistle)</i>

55:15.392 --> 55:17.478
Take care.

55:25.569 --> 55:29.114
Well, Mr. Ambassador, you've got
the fastest horse in the hunt.

55:29.198 --> 55:31.909
And it's a lovely
morning for you.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

59:43.076 --> 59:45.162
OK, boys.

01:00:39.925 --> 01:00:42.136
Aagh!

01:00:58.068 --> 01:01:00.821
Take him.

01:01:11.623 --> 01:01:13.792
Aagh!

01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.418
Damien!

01:01:59.505 --> 01:02:01.590
Damien, did you catch one?

01:02:01.799 --> 01:02:06.094
The hounds didn't leave too
many souvenirs, but, uh...

01:02:06.178 --> 01:02:08.305
I saved some of the blood.

01:02:08.388 --> 01:02:11.266
Can <i>you</i> blood me? Does it count?

01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:14.144
It does with me.

01:03:42.858 --> 01:03:45.569
Disciples of the watch...

01:03:49.072 --> 01:03:51.950
I stand before you...

01:03:52.034 --> 01:03:55.329
in the name of the
one true god...

01:03:56.246 --> 01:04:01.543
who was cast out from
heaven but is alive...

01:04:01.627 --> 01:04:03.712
in me.

01:04:04.463 --> 01:04:06.548
Do you hear me?

01:04:06.632 --> 01:04:09.343
<i>(all)</i> We hear and obey.

01:04:09.426 --> 01:04:12.513
We hear and obey.

01:04:12.596 --> 01:04:15.098
I now command you...

01:04:16.099 --> 01:04:19.728
to seek out and destroy
the Nazarene child.

01:04:20.771 --> 01:04:23.273
Slay the Nazarene...

01:04:23.899 --> 01:04:26.652
and I shall reign for ever.

01:04:26.985 --> 01:04:29.071
Fail...

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:32.449
and I perish.

01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:35.577
Slay the Nazarene...

01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:39.665
and you, my disciples...

01:04:40.207 --> 01:04:43.335
shall truly inherit this earth.

01:04:45.087 --> 01:04:47.172
Fail...

01:04:47.673 --> 01:04:52.302
and you will perish
without trace.

01:04:54.555 --> 01:04:56.640
Slay the Nazarene...

01:04:57.224 --> 01:05:03.105
and you will know the violent
raptures of my father's kingdom.

01:05:04.398 --> 01:05:06.942
Fail...

01:05:07.025 --> 01:05:10.696
and you will be condemned
to a numbing eternity...

01:05:10.779 --> 01:05:14.324
in the flaccid bosom of Christ.

01:05:14.408 --> 01:05:16.535
Do you hear me?

01:05:16.618 --> 01:05:18.829
<i>(all)</i> We hear and obey.

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:22.583
Disciples of the watch...

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:26.962
there must be no delay.

01:05:28.505 --> 01:05:31.049
Slay the Nazarene...

01:05:31.133 --> 01:05:35.220
and the victory will be ours...

01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:41.268
now... and for ever more.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.355
Do you hear me?

01:05:45.439 --> 01:05:47.316
<i>(all)</i> We hear. We hear.

01:05:47.733 --> 01:05:49.610
We hear. We hear.

01:06:13.634 --> 01:06:16.386
We're going for a
walk now, aren't we?

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.972
With Auntie Carol, hey?

01:06:20.224 --> 01:06:24.186
- Barbara!
- Oh, hi. I'll be with you in just a minute.

01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:27.231
There you go. All wrapped up.

01:06:27.731 --> 01:06:29.608
- Harvey!
- Yeah?

01:06:29.691 --> 01:06:33.695
I'm just going shopping with Carol.
I'm gonna take Junior with me, OK?

01:06:33.779 --> 01:06:37.199
Listen, don't forget to pick up
my stuff from the cleaner's.

01:06:37.282 --> 01:06:40.285
- No, I won't. I'll see you later.
- Bye.

01:07:22.202 --> 01:07:24.580
Peterson? Harvey Dean.

01:07:24.663 --> 01:07:28.667
I said "I'm not paying you that much.
You've only been here for two hours."

01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:32.254
- What do you expect me to say?
- You've got such a nerve.

01:07:32.546 --> 01:07:37.634
The Brookman family
at 23 Ormsby Road...

01:07:37.718 --> 01:07:41.180
Sefton Park, Liverpool.

01:07:43.474 --> 01:07:49.104
Listen, Peterson, I don't give a shit how
you feel about this! Just do the job!

01:07:50.647 --> 01:07:52.399
OK.

01:07:52.483 --> 01:07:56.236
Now... Sefton Park, Liverpool.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.198
And the boy's name
is Christopher.

01:08:03.577 --> 01:08:05.662
Kirkby Towers.

01:08:05.746 --> 01:08:08.081
Kirkby 14.

01:08:08.165 --> 01:08:10.792
Boy's name is Alexander David.

01:08:12.211 --> 01:08:14.213
OK?

01:08:14.296 --> 01:08:16.965
By Tuesday night.

01:08:17.049 --> 01:08:19.134
Right.

01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:28.477
Blake? Dean.

01:08:28.644 --> 01:08:31.563
Why don't you and Harvey
come over for a meal?

01:08:31.647 --> 01:08:34.274
Yeah. OK. That's nice.

01:08:34.358 --> 01:08:36.443
I'll call you later. Bye.

01:08:40.363 --> 01:08:45.661
We'll soon be home and you can have
something nice to eat. Are you hungry?

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:53.919
Who's a good boy, then?

01:08:54.002 --> 01:08:56.087
Can you hear me?

01:09:02.761 --> 01:09:05.180
Oh, no!

01:09:10.394 --> 01:09:12.563
<i>(Carol)</i> No!

01:09:24.448 --> 01:09:27.411
- Name this child...
- Alexander David.

01:09:34.501 --> 01:09:37.962
I baptise you Alexander David...

01:09:38.046 --> 01:09:42.843
in the name of the
Father and of the Son...

01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:45.761
and of the Holy Spirit.

01:09:46.471 --> 01:09:52.269
We receive this child into the
congregation of Christ's flock...

01:09:52.352 --> 01:09:56.023
and sign him with the
sign of the cross.

01:10:11.205 --> 01:10:15.292
Morning, missis. We've come to
do our good deed for the day.

01:10:52.871 --> 01:10:55.791
<i>We're devoting the first
part of our programme...</i>

01:10:55.874 --> 01:10:58.595
<i>to a disturbing
phenomenon that's been</i>

01:10:58.596 --> 01:11:01.380
<i>puzzling both doctors
and police this week.</i>

01:11:01.463 --> 01:11:05.509
<i>The mysterious deaths of numbers of
babies in the kind of circumstances...</i>

01:11:05.592 --> 01:11:08.846
<i>that coroners are fond of
terming "misadventure".</i>

01:11:09.346 --> 01:11:12.446
<i>At the turn of the century,
the infant mortality</i>

01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:14.977
<i>rate stood at a
staggering 34 per cent.</i>

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:18.564
<i>In 1945 it dropped
to 16 per cent.</i>

01:11:18.647 --> 01:11:23.777
<i>And nowadays it's been cut back to under
two per cent. That is, until last week.</i>

01:11:23.861 --> 01:11:27.990
<i>In Greater London, 17 babies have
died in the last seven days...</i>

01:11:28.073 --> 01:11:32.744
<i>with a further 14 deaths reported from
Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester...</i>

01:11:32.828 --> 01:11:36.999
<i>Leeds and Liverpool. These may
not sound unduly high figures...</i>

01:11:37.082 --> 01:11:42.129
<i>but nationwide they represent a
chilling 15 to 20 per cent increase...</i>

01:11:42.212 --> 01:11:44.381
<i>in the mortality rate.</i> Harvey...

01:11:44.465 --> 01:11:48.969
<i>- Details are still sketchy at the moment.</i>
- It's just a coincidence, that's all.

01:11:49.052 --> 01:11:54.641
<i>Except one - in every case the
victim has been a baby boy.</i>

01:11:54.725 --> 01:11:58.854
<i>To throw further light on the subject,
I have with me Dr. Richard Philmore...</i>

01:11:58.937 --> 01:12:01.982
<i>from the Ministry of Health
and Social Security.</i>

01:12:02.065 --> 01:12:06.153
<i>- Tell me, what explanation do you have?</i>
- Barbara?

01:12:06.612 --> 01:12:09.239
<i>It's too soon for us to
make any statement...</i>

01:12:09.323 --> 01:12:12.409
<i>but I'd like to correct you on
a point that you just made.</i>

01:12:12.493 --> 01:12:16.205
<i>It really is quite inaccurate to
speak of a 20 per cent rise...</i>

01:12:16.288 --> 01:12:19.458
<i>in the infant
mortality rate index.</i>

01:12:19.541 --> 01:12:25.306
<i>Our statistics are based on annual
averages and not on weekly fluctuations.</i>

01:12:25.389 --> 01:12:28.274
<i>But surely you admit there's
been an unexplained increase</i>

01:12:28.275 --> 01:12:30.761
<i>in the deaths among baby
boys over the last week?</i>

01:12:31.178 --> 01:12:33.698
<i>A rise, but nothing
compared to the rise you'd</i>

01:12:33.699 --> 01:12:36.058
<i>expect to find during,
say, a flu epidemic.</i>

01:12:36.141 --> 01:12:39.603
<i>Surely, Dr. Philmore, we're not
talking about a flu epidemic.</i>

01:12:39.686 --> 01:12:43.398
<i>We're talking about household
burns, drownings...</i>

01:12:43.482 --> 01:12:47.361
<i>car accidents, suffocation,
food poisonings, electrocution.</i>

01:12:47.444 --> 01:12:49.808
<i>Scotland Yard has assured
us that in their</i>

01:12:49.809 --> 01:12:52.282
<i>opinion there is no
question of foul play...</i>

01:12:52.366 --> 01:12:56.453
<i>in any of the mortalities reported.
Forgive me if I speak bluntly...</i>

01:12:56.537 --> 01:13:00.290
<i>but your kind of scaremonger reporting
is the kind of behaviour...</i>

01:13:00.374 --> 01:13:02.709
<i>that brings the media
into bad repute.</i>

01:13:05.546 --> 01:13:07.631
- Night, Miss Reynolds.
- Night, Bill.

01:13:54.428 --> 01:13:56.680
Miss Reynolds.

01:13:56.763 --> 01:13:58.891
I need to talk to you urgently.

01:13:58.974 --> 01:14:01.575
It's about your programme
about the deaths.

01:14:01.576 --> 01:14:04.354
A protest march of one.
How disappointing.

01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:09.401
On the contrary, I congratulate
you on your perceptiveness.

01:14:09.485 --> 01:14:11.695
Well?

01:14:11.778 --> 01:14:14.656
- May we go inside?
- I'm sorry, erm...

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.118
- Father De Carlo.
- I've had a long day, Father.

01:14:18.202 --> 01:14:21.038
If you call my secretary,
she'll make an appointment.

01:14:21.121 --> 01:14:24.416
I told you, I need to
talk to you urgently.

01:14:26.543 --> 01:14:29.797
OK. But, erm, please
keep your voice down.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:32.382
My son's asleep.

01:14:37.262 --> 01:14:41.058
"Then Herod sent forth and slew all the
children that were in Bethlehem..."

01:14:41.141 --> 01:14:43.602
and in all the coasts thereof...

01:14:43.685 --> 01:14:47.606
according to the time of
the birth of Jesus...

01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:50.692
"which he had diligently
inquired of the wise men."

01:14:50.776 --> 01:14:53.529
What <i>are</i> you talking about?

01:14:53.612 --> 01:14:57.491
You stated that the common factor
about these killings is...

01:14:57.574 --> 01:15:01.203
that all the victims
have been baby boys.

01:15:02.162 --> 01:15:04.540
But there is another
common factor.

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:11.255
All the boys were born between midnight
and 6am on the morning of March 24th.

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:16.135
Every child that's still living born
between those hours is in mortal danger...

01:15:16.218 --> 01:15:20.639
if he has not already been killed. Are
you suggesting they've been murdered?

01:15:20.722 --> 01:15:24.351
No, no, I am not. I am
stating it as a fact.

01:15:25.435 --> 01:15:29.565
- Who on earth would do such a thing?
- He is born again, Miss Reynolds.

01:15:29.648 --> 01:15:33.443
And so is the Antichrist.
The son of Satan.

01:15:33.902 --> 01:15:37.447
As foretold in the
Book of Revelation.

01:15:38.115 --> 01:15:43.453
I'm sorry, Father. Look, I do respect
your faith, but I don't share it.

01:15:43.745 --> 01:15:48.375
- You are not a practising Christian?
- No, I'm a practising journalist.

01:15:48.458 --> 01:15:51.253
One rule of journalism is
to be a doubting Thomas.

01:15:51.336 --> 01:15:55.507
I need to see evidence
with my own two eyes.

01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:57.759
Right.

01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:02.347
Here is your evidence.

01:16:02.431 --> 01:16:05.267
Check them for yourself.

01:16:06.768 --> 01:16:12.941
Copies of the dead boys' birth certificates
from the central registry office.

01:16:14.276 --> 01:16:18.655
In every case, the child was born
on the morning of March 24th.

01:16:20.657 --> 01:16:25.204
Even if I can't appeal to your
faith, I appeal to your logic.

01:16:25.287 --> 01:16:30.584
Why else would someone want to destroy
all children born on that date...

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:34.463
were it not in an effort to
destroy one child in particular?

01:16:34.546 --> 01:16:39.802
That child is our blessed
Saviour, Jesus Christ, reborn.

01:16:41.094 --> 01:16:45.766
Thus fulfilling his promise
that, at the end of times...

01:16:45.849 --> 01:16:50.604
he shall come again to deliver
the world from the Antichrist.

01:16:50.687 --> 01:16:53.857
And who exactly is
this... Antichrist?

01:16:54.233 --> 01:16:57.486
The American ambassador,
Damien Thorn.

01:16:58.654 --> 01:17:01.573
That's ridiculous! I
know Damien Thorn.

01:17:02.074 --> 01:17:05.369
You may know the man.
Do you know his soul?

01:17:05.452 --> 01:17:08.455
Miss Reynolds, I am a
religious man, not a fanatic.

01:17:08.789 --> 01:17:12.042
One of the commandments
of my faith is...

01:17:12.125 --> 01:17:16.922
that we shall not bear false
witness against any man.

01:17:17.005 --> 01:17:20.425
If I had one shred of doubt
about Damien Thorn...

01:17:20.509 --> 01:17:24.012
my faith would command
me to remain silent.

01:17:24.096 --> 01:17:27.182
But I've watched him
now for 27 years...

01:17:27.808 --> 01:17:32.896
ever since his father came to our
monastery to seek help in destroying him.

01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:36.775
I've watched him grow
from a boy into a man...

01:17:36.859 --> 01:17:41.405
seen him exterminate all
those who stood in his way.

01:17:43.574 --> 01:17:47.077
Very well. You know
Thorn, the man.

01:17:51.832 --> 01:17:55.043
I'll leave you with
our research on him.

01:17:55.127 --> 01:17:59.882
But you must satisfy yourself
before reaching your opinion.

01:17:59.965 --> 01:18:07.139
And when you have done so, I would urge
that you contact me as soon as possible...

01:18:07.222 --> 01:18:09.683
at this address.

01:18:11.602 --> 01:18:13.979
Here.

01:18:14.062 --> 01:18:16.648
Day or night.

01:18:18.275 --> 01:18:19.776
I, erm...

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.071
I can't promise you
anything, Father.

01:18:23.155 --> 01:18:27.993
You say I know only Thorn,
the man - not his soul.

01:18:28.076 --> 01:18:32.498
But if I don't even know my own
soul, how can I see into his?

01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:34.666
Only God can show you that.

01:18:36.335 --> 01:18:42.466
There is, however, one sign that
identifies him as the Antichrist.

01:18:43.926 --> 01:18:46.929
You will find it in the Book
of Revelation, as I told you.

01:18:47.346 --> 01:18:51.058
You will also find
it on Thorn himself.

01:18:52.643 --> 01:18:55.145
Under his hair.

01:18:56.146 --> 01:18:58.232
Here.

01:18:58.315 --> 01:19:01.026
The birthmark of the devil.

01:19:01.735 --> 01:19:05.280
6... 6... 6.

01:19:13.163 --> 01:19:16.792
I'll let myself out. Good
night, Miss Reynolds.

01:19:17.835 --> 01:19:21.630
And may God guide your decision.

01:20:00.961 --> 01:20:03.380
The Israelis are onto Schroeder.

01:20:03.464 --> 01:20:08.510
We've got to eliminate him - now! Before
they have a chance to make him talk.

01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:10.000
Then do it.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.513
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Then do it.

01:20:11.513 --> 01:20:11.597
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:11.597 --> 01:20:16.351
But we can't get close to him.
They've got him in Tel Aviv.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:16.351 --> 01:20:16.435
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:16.435 --> 01:20:20.939
- Damien, you're the only one that can do it.
- You can handle it.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.939 --> 01:20:21.023
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.023 --> 01:20:22.000
- I just told you. We can't get...
- And I told you...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.693
- I just told you. We can't get...
- And I told you...

01:20:26.361 --> 01:20:31.074
that every day the Nazarene
lives, my force would weaken.

01:20:31.158 --> 01:20:34.495
- Now, how many boys are left?
- Three or four.

01:20:34.578 --> 01:20:37.998
- Including your son?
- Now, wait a minute.

01:20:38.081 --> 01:20:41.043
I've already told you,
he was born March 23rd.

01:20:41.126 --> 01:20:45.339
- Now you gotta believe me.
- I'll believe you when the Nazarene is dead.

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.553
Yes?

01:20:51.637 --> 01:20:53.305
Who is this?

01:20:54.807 --> 01:20:58.894
It's Kate Reynolds' son. He's
calling from a coin box.

01:20:59.353 --> 01:21:03.232
- But How'd he get this number?
- I gave it to him.

01:21:09.238 --> 01:21:11.323
Hello, Peter?

01:21:13.283 --> 01:21:18.372
Good. Now, listen carefully. I want
you to follow him wherever he goes...

01:21:18.455 --> 01:21:21.416
and make sure he
doesn't see you, OK?

01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:25.671
Yeah, and call me as
soon as you find out.

01:21:26.713 --> 01:21:28.799
All right.

01:21:30.384 --> 01:21:35.681
Be careful, Damien. His mother was
on the phone earlier this morning.

01:21:35.764 --> 01:21:38.809
- She wants to see you.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:38.934 --> 01:21:42.563
- I wanna talk to her.
- Because she's dangerous.

01:21:42.646 --> 01:21:47.025
I decide who's dangerous and who
isn't. Now, get her on the phone...

01:21:47.109 --> 01:21:50.237
and tell her I wanna see
her tomorrow at the house.

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.531
And don't mention Peter.

01:23:15.155 --> 01:23:18.075
Hi, honey! I'm home!

01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:28.836
What are you doing in here?

01:23:29.753 --> 01:23:32.464
Don't you come anywhere
near him, you murderer!

01:23:32.548 --> 01:23:35.467
Murderer? What are
you talking about?

01:23:35.551 --> 01:23:38.679
You lay one finger on him,
and I'll butcher you...

01:23:38.762 --> 01:23:41.974
just like you've butchered
all these other children.

01:23:42.057 --> 01:23:47.980
A priest came by today. He came to warn
me that Damien Thorn is the Antichrist...

01:23:48.063 --> 01:23:51.099
and he'll murder my
baby, like he's killed

01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:54.069
these others that were
born on the same day.

01:23:54.153 --> 01:23:57.197
- You believe some religious maniac?
- No!

01:23:57.281 --> 01:23:59.825
I found the proof myself!

01:24:00.659 --> 01:24:02.911
You don't know what you've done.

01:24:11.003 --> 01:24:14.339
<i>(Kate)</i> I once hosted a programme,
<i>And Now For The Good News...</i>

01:24:14.423 --> 01:24:17.718
which won an RTA
award. <i>(Thorn)</i> Really?

01:24:17.801 --> 01:24:20.679
For the lowest audience
viewing figure of the year.

01:24:20.762 --> 01:24:23.299
Yet now I'm reporting
death and destruction,

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:25.893
and my shows gone to the
top of the ratings.

01:24:25.976 --> 01:24:30.355
- Everyone loves a mystery.
- I think it goes deeper than that.

01:24:30.439 --> 01:24:35.319
We might aspire after good, but our
real fascination lies with evil.

01:24:35.402 --> 01:24:38.447
- Don't you agree?
- Not really.

01:24:38.530 --> 01:24:43.660
Most people confuse evil with their
own trivial lusts and perversions.

01:24:43.744 --> 01:24:46.997
Now, true evil is as
pure as innocence.

01:24:47.831 --> 01:24:50.334
Then what <i>is</i> evil?

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:52.503
Come on.

01:24:57.090 --> 01:25:00.010
- I'll show you where Old Nick hangs out.
- Old who?

01:25:00.093 --> 01:25:02.179
Old Nick.

01:25:07.476 --> 01:25:12.731
He's down there somewhere, lurking
in the shadows, ready to pounce.

01:25:12.815 --> 01:25:15.567
He must be at least 40 by now.

01:25:15.651 --> 01:25:18.570
We first met when
I was about four.

01:25:19.321 --> 01:25:21.907
We've been old
friends ever since.

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:24.827
You know Old Nick is the name
for the devil in England?

01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:29.039
Of course I know. But it's
a great name for a pike.

01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:33.961
Do you believe in God?

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:39.591
I think you know the answer
to that question already.

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:45.514
- Look, there it goes!
- Where?

01:25:45.597 --> 01:25:47.891
Down there.

01:25:53.397 --> 01:25:55.482
Damien! Help me!

01:25:58.610 --> 01:26:00.654
Damien! I can't...

01:26:02.656 --> 01:26:04.741
Help me!

01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:37.274
Well, that should fit you.

01:26:42.779 --> 01:26:45.699
I feel like a moth...

01:26:46.825 --> 01:26:50.370
that's flown too
close to the flame.

01:26:52.456 --> 01:26:54.958
But who is the moth...

01:26:55.584 --> 01:26:58.295
and who's the flame?

01:27:10.557 --> 01:27:12.476
Don't stop, Damien.

01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:15.562
Don't stop.

01:27:15.646 --> 01:27:17.731
Please don't stop.

01:27:20.776 --> 01:27:24.947
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

01:27:25.030 --> 01:27:27.115
Hey.

01:27:28.075 --> 01:27:30.160
Hey. Hey.

01:27:34.456 --> 01:27:36.959
You wanna see what I see?

01:27:38.085 --> 01:27:40.587
I want you, Damien.

01:27:52.099 --> 01:27:55.102
You're hurting me.

01:27:55.185 --> 01:27:58.272
Birth is pain. Death is pain.

01:27:58.355 --> 01:28:00.607
Beauty is pain.

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:53.470
Damien?

01:30:05.732 --> 01:30:07.818
Damien?

01:30:55.616 --> 01:30:57.701
Damien?

01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:47.084
Damien.

01:32:26.373 --> 01:32:29.877
- Was Schroeder on the Thorn payola or not?
- No statement.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.672
- Can't we talk to Ambassador Thorn?
- The ambassador is unavailable.

01:32:33.755 --> 01:32:36.091
- He's not even here.
- Where is he?

01:32:36.175 --> 01:32:40.220
When he is ready to make a
statement, we will let you know.

01:32:48.270 --> 01:32:51.690
Damien, I thought you
were up at the house.

01:32:51.773 --> 01:32:54.485
The press are going
crazy for a statement.

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:58.363
I can hold 'em off until I've talked
to Buher, but you're gonna have to...

01:32:58.447 --> 01:33:01.366
What was De Carlo doing
at your house yesterday?

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.869
Who?

01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:07.539
Now, come on, Dean.
Just give me the truth.

01:33:08.707 --> 01:33:14.213
I'm telling the truth. I've never
heard of De Carlo before in my life.

01:33:14.296 --> 01:33:16.381
Peter.

01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:28.602
- Go ahead, Peter.
- "At half past three yesterday afternoon..."

01:33:28.685 --> 01:33:32.981
I saw the priest called De Carlo
go to 144 Abbey Crescent...

01:33:33.065 --> 01:33:37.444
"where he spent an hour and 22 minutes
talking to the wife of Mr. Dean."

01:33:40.405 --> 01:33:42.491
Damien... look, I...

01:33:44.076 --> 01:33:46.203
I didn't know he was a priest.

01:33:46.286 --> 01:33:49.122
- I didn't know Barbara would...
- Kill your son!

01:33:49.873 --> 01:33:51.333
What?!

01:33:51.708 --> 01:33:57.422
There's only one boy left, and that's
your son. Destroy him... or be destroyed.

01:33:58.173 --> 01:34:00.425
Damien, for the love of God!

01:34:00.509 --> 01:34:03.428
"And God said unto Abraham:."

01:34:04.555 --> 01:34:08.350
Take now thy son,
thine only Isaac...

01:34:08.433 --> 01:34:13.230
"whom thou lovest, and offer
him for a burnt offering."

01:34:15.774 --> 01:34:21.405
Now, if Abraham was willing to slay his
own son for the love of <i>his</i> god...

01:34:21.488 --> 01:34:25.784
why won't you do the same
for mine? You're all crazy.

01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.745
Crazy.

01:34:34.209 --> 01:34:37.004
Aren't you gonna stop him?

01:34:37.087 --> 01:34:39.965
There's no need.

01:35:14.875 --> 01:35:16.835
Go on! Go away!

01:35:16.919 --> 01:35:19.004
Go on!

01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:24.676
There, now. It's
OK, honey. He...

01:36:07.177 --> 01:36:10.305
Barbara! Barbara! Start packing!

01:36:14.351 --> 01:36:16.436
Barbara?

01:36:16.895 --> 01:36:18.981
Barbara! Barbara!

01:36:24.194 --> 01:36:26.280
Barbara!

01:36:49.011 --> 01:36:51.722
Aagh!

01:36:56.643 --> 01:37:01.690
<i>(man)</i> Ten o'clock, Miss Reynolds.
Locking up in five minutes.

01:37:01.773 --> 01:37:03.859
Coming.

01:37:06.945 --> 01:37:09.031
Miss Reynolds.

01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:14.536
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?
- You saw him, didn't you?

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.707
You know Thorn is the Antichrist,
so why are you protecting him?

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:23.462
Either you get out of here
or I'll call security.

01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:27.633
Your son... Where is he?

01:37:27.966 --> 01:37:32.596
- He's in bed and asleep, of course.
- He is not.

01:37:32.679 --> 01:37:35.015
Your son is with Damien Thorn.

01:37:37.142 --> 01:37:42.898
In body and soul. Your son has
become an apostle of the Antichrist.

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:47.194
You think Peter's been at
school for the past three days?

01:37:47.277 --> 01:37:50.072
Check with the school if
you don't believe me.

01:37:50.155 --> 01:37:55.285
He's been working for Thorn,
conspiring to murder the holy child.

01:37:56.745 --> 01:37:59.581
They won't succeed.

01:38:00.624 --> 01:38:05.045
The holy child is beyond
his powers now. He's safe.

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:10.676
But <i>your</i> child is not. There is only one
way to save your son, Miss Reynolds.

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:15.222
And that's by destroying
the Antichrist.

01:38:15.305 --> 01:38:19.393
- Are you asking me?
- No. No, Miss Reynolds.

01:38:20.352 --> 01:38:23.313
That is to be <i>my</i> sacred task.

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:28.569
But if you value your son's immortal
soul, you must help me to carry it out.

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:31.864
<i>(man)</i> Hurry along, Miss
Reynolds. We're locking up.

01:38:31.947 --> 01:38:34.032
I'll be out in a moment.

01:38:37.452 --> 01:38:42.124
- I'm going home to my son.
- Then I beg you to let me come with you.

01:38:42.207 --> 01:38:46.003
There will be no time to lose
when you find he's not there.

01:38:46.086 --> 01:38:48.172
Please.

01:39:02.644 --> 01:39:06.064
You think you've won, do you?

01:39:06.148 --> 01:39:11.778
You watched me slay a hundred children
and never lifted a finger to save them.

01:39:12.863 --> 01:39:18.744
"Suffer the little children to come unto
me." Your words, Nazarene, not mine.

01:39:23.582 --> 01:39:26.919
<i>(Damien) Oh, Satan,
the victory is thine.</i>

01:39:27.961 --> 01:39:32.966
<i>All praise to thee, for thou hast
delivered this child unto me...</i>

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:36.678
<i>that I may be brought face
to face with the Nazarene...</i>

01:39:36.762 --> 01:39:39.139
<i>at last.</i>

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:43.310
<i>Now, Peter, listen to me
and listen carefully.</i>

01:39:43.393 --> 01:39:47.147
<i>The Christian faith has ten
commandments. I have only one.</i>

01:39:47.231 --> 01:39:51.026
Say it now and we two
shall become as one.

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:55.155
- I love you.
- Beyond all others.

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:58.242
- Beyond all others.
- Beyond life itself.

01:39:58.325 --> 01:40:00.410
No, Peter. Don't say it.

01:40:03.205 --> 01:40:05.999
Give me back my son...

01:40:06.083 --> 01:40:09.711
and I will lead you to the
Christ child. Where is he?

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:13.632
Give me back Peter first
and I'll take you to him.

01:40:13.715 --> 01:40:20.556
Very well. You shall lead us both to the
Nazarene, and then Peter shall be yours.

01:40:20.639 --> 01:40:25.310
- No, Damien! It's a trick!
- Not if she wants her son back, it isn't.

01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:28.021
All right.

01:40:41.410 --> 01:40:43.620
If you can help me...

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:45.789
help me now.

01:41:33.837 --> 01:41:35.839
<i>(Kate)</i> No!

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:39.134
Peter!

01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:45.390
Peter? Oh, Peter, dearest!

01:41:47.142 --> 01:41:50.687
- No.
- Where is your god now, priest?

01:42:02.157 --> 01:42:05.035
I'm here, Nazarene!

01:42:05.118 --> 01:42:07.204
Where are you?

01:42:08.163 --> 01:42:10.249
You hear me?

01:42:13.252 --> 01:42:15.337
Face me!

01:42:16.338 --> 01:42:18.632
Face me!

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.388
<i>(echoes)</i> It's time!

01:42:36.692 --> 01:42:39.194
Show yourself!

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:48.287
I know you're here!

01:42:48.954 --> 01:42:52.291
Come out and face me!

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:25.240
You bastard!

01:44:24.842 --> 01:44:26.927
Nazarene...

01:44:27.928 --> 01:44:30.097
You have won...

01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:32.516
nothing.
