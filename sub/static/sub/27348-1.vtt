Have come and gone

01:12.440 --> 01:14.635
Through the misty
morning showers

01:14.760 --> 01:17.194
I greet the dawn

01:17.360 --> 01:19.828
For when its light
has hit the ground

01:19.920 --> 01:21.990
There 's lots of treasures
to be found

I'm turning down

Please don 't feel blue

01:42.680 --> 01:44.875
For in this part

There 's a different

from your chums

02:21.920 --> 02:26.471
Seems the promise
of tomorrow never comes

02:26.640 --> 02:29.234
But since you dreamed
the night away

02:29.320 --> 02:31.595
Tomorrow's here,
it's called today

Ah! Good morning, mum.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.357
They don't look
much like plumbers to me.

07:55.520 --> 07:56.555
I meant on the phone.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.153
We are not plumbers,
we are lawyers.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.355

07:59.440 --> 08:01.396
And here's me

the River Thames in there!

I'll clean up.

Why don't you see
to the breakfast?

08:51.480 --> 08:53.038
Well, yes, somebody's got to,
haven't they?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.236
Unless we all wanna starve.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.353
Why don't you let Ellen
clean up?

08:57.520 --> 08:59.192
I'm afraid, lately,
that means more work for me.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.634
The other day,
I found a butcher's sack

-and my hat was in the larder.

supposed to make breakfast

in the larder...

but pickled herrings
and marmalade?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.231
The groceries.
I meant to go yesterday.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.994
Very well.
Pickled herrings for breakfast

09:30.080 --> 09:31.638
and marmalade for lunch.

09:31.840 --> 09:33.831
There's a shop
across the park, will be open.

-The three of us can go.
-Thank you, John.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.837
But you said we would go
to the park today!

09:37.920 --> 09:38.909
We can cut through the park
on the way.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.149
ANNABEL:
Enough, Georgie, come along.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.229
I'll take that, Father.

that I can do for you?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.989
I am Hamilton Gooding.
This is Mr. Templeton Frye.

-(JANE GIGGLES)

09:56.960 --> 09:57.949

No. Sorry, nothing.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.393
"Spruce"?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.630
Is that your garden club?

10:03.800 --> 10:06.792
No, it's the Society for
the Protection of the Rights

10:06.880 --> 10:08.438
of the Underpaid Citizens
of England.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.670
A labor organizer.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.518
She's a labor organizer.

10:12.680 --> 10:13.669
Yes.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.916
Yes, but we also run
soup kitchens.

10:16.080 --> 10:18.150
It's a never-ending job
these days, I'm afraid.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.958
I'm sure it is, Mrs. Banks.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.315
Miss Banks, actually.
I'm Michael's sister.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.038
My wife passed away
this last year.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.760
That's awful.
Those poor children.

10:26.920 --> 10:29.036
Yes. Our deepest condolences.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.189
Thank you. Forgive me,

10:30.280 --> 10:31.315
what brings the two of you
here this morning?

10:31.440 --> 10:33.317
I'm going to say my goodbyes.
I'm late for work.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.629
Mr. Banks, you took out a loan

10:34.720 --> 10:35.914
with the
Fidelity Fiduciary Bank...

10:36.000 --> 10:38.275
last year against the value
of your home.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.589
You did what? Michael.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.637
I had to, Jane.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.109
With Kate and the bills piling
up, I really had no choice.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.475
It's hard enough these days,
isn't it?

10:46.640 --> 10:48.312
Yes. Well... Shh!

10:48.480 --> 10:49.674
It seems you have fallen

10:49.760 --> 10:52.274
three months behind
in your payments.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.952
Oh. (SIGHS)

10:54.040 --> 10:55.314
I'm so sorry.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.517
Uh, Kate, my wife, used to
look after our finances.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.154
And I've been
a bit off stride. Forgive me.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.436
How much is it
that I owe you, exactly?

11:03.640 --> 11:06.108
Unfortunately,
the bank is now demanding

11:06.200 --> 11:09.476
that you pay back
the entire loan in full.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.514
The entire loan?

11:12.680 --> 11:13.795
Yes. It's all in the contract.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.598
That's more than I make in
a year. I couldn't possibly.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.159
Oh, dear.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.112
You have five days.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.197
If you are unable
to pay in full

11:21.280 --> 11:22.508
by Friday at midnight...

11:22.680 --> 11:24.875
I'm afraid we will have
to repossess your home...

11:25.080 --> 11:27.389
and you will have to vacate
the premises.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.873
But I work
for Fidelity Fiduciary.

11:31.080 --> 11:32.559
Not as an accountant,
I presume.

11:32.720 --> 11:33.789
No, as a teller.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.194
I took a part-time position
there this past year.

11:35.360 --> 11:36.475
You see, I'm really an artist.

11:36.640 --> 11:37.789
Yes, be that as it may.

11:37.960 --> 11:41.270
But my father, George Banks,
was a senior partner there.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.668
Father left us shares
in the bank.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.318
You could use those
to pay off the loan.

11:44.480 --> 11:45.674
I was saving those
for the children.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.990
Shares? In the bank?

11:48.160 --> 11:50.594
Well, that does change things,
doesn't it?

11:50.920 --> 11:52.797
Primed and ready,
Mr. Binnacle?

11:52.960 --> 11:54.678
Ready and charged, sir.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.239
Do you have
the share certificate?

11:56.440 --> 11:58.158
-l'm sorry, the what?
-FRYE: The document...

11:58.360 --> 12:00.828
The document proving
you own shares in the bank.

12:01.360 --> 12:03.032
I suppose it must be somewhere
among Father's old papers.

12:03.240 --> 12:04.229
Yes, I suppose it must.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.549
ADMIRAL BOOM: Three...

12:05.640 --> 12:06.629

He fires off a cannon
to mark the hour.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.633
He's over five minutes late.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.239
Yes. I'm afraid
he's been running

12:30.360 --> 12:32.191
a little behind
these last few years.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.271
As are we, this morning.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.710
You've been given notice.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.270
We'll see ourselves out.
Come along, Mr. Frye.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.590
I do hope you find that share
certificate. I really do.

12:42.760 --> 12:45.320
Good day to you both!

12:46.680 --> 12:49.148
You really have chosen the
wrong profession, you know.

12:50.240 --> 12:51.593
(DOOR CLOSES)

12:53.960 --> 12:56.554
Why didn't you tell me
you'd taken out a loan?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.631
(SIGHS)
I didn't want to worry you.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.433
Or the children.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.479
I kept thinking
I would catch up.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.312
Kate always managed.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.155

I can't lose our home, Jane.
She's everywhere, here.

Well, then, we're not
going to let that happen.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.356
But, Michael, you know we
neither of us have any money,

13:15.560 --> 13:17.152
so we just have to find
that share certificate.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.912
Do you have any idea where
Father might have kept it?

13:19.080 --> 13:20.069
I don't know.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.388
-In the attic, perhaps?
-Yes.

to bring you into all of this.

everything's fine. You need...

-NO. NO, no, no.
-NO, no. I...

MICHAEL: Aunt Jane was only...

13:36.440 --> 13:38.317
(STAMMERS) I was just saying
you won't have to worry,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.391
because your father
owns shares in the bank.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.552
But you said we don't have
enough money.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.759
Well, I can make more money.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.673
I am a banker now, aren't I?
That's what bankers do.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.393
Make money.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.875
But you're not a banker.
You're a painter.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.679
Yes, well,
painters don't make money.

13:55.840 --> 13:58.070
Not these days. Here, you see.

13:58.240 --> 14:00.231
The day has hardly begun,

your hats on, shall we?

14:07.840 --> 14:08.829
One moment, John.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.598
Georgie shouldn't have to
spend his 10 pounds

14:11.680 --> 14:12.795
on the shopping, should he?

14:12.960 --> 14:14.234
Here you are.

14:14.720 --> 14:16.597
Thank you, Father.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.752
Ah! Off to the park, I see.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.632
-Yes, that's right, Ellen.
-That's nice.

14:22.720 --> 14:23.835
Shall we search
the attic, then?

14:23.920 --> 14:24.909
Don't you have to go to work?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.433
NO. Work can wait.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.589
Oh, thank you, Jane.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.835
Well, why don't I check
the attic

14:28.920 --> 14:29.909
and you check Father's
old wardrobe?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.069
-Yes.
-We'll make lunch

No, Georgie! We haven't enough
for groceries as it is.

Oi! Georgie Banks!
Keep off the grass.

caring for it

get trampled on.

What if Father
does lose the house?

15:15.720 --> 15:16.994
We'll just have to
figure out a way

15:17.080 --> 15:18.354
to get it back, I suppose.

everything's gone wrong here

our daughter's hair

-Of course, Mary Poppins.

Good, good.
That's all settled.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.679
Then I'll stay.
Now, if you'll excuse me...

25:19.840 --> 25:21.273
the children have turned
themselves into dustbins.

25:21.440 --> 25:22.793
So the first order of business

25:22.880 --> 25:24.757
is to see them properly bathed
and dressed.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.957
Jane, have you gone
completely mad?

25:29.120 --> 25:30.678

on anyone else.

for the time being, I suppose.

all this way on a kite.

you flew here on a kite?

the share certificate.

51:18.720 --> 51:19.869
the quicker you're out of it.

51:24.840 --> 51:27.149
Once upon a time
in a nursery rhyme

51:27.320 --> 51:29.117
There was a castle
with a king hiding in a wing

51:29.280 --> 51:30.429
'Cause he never
went to school

51:30.520 --> 51:31.635
To learn a single thing

51:31.800 --> 51:33.756
He had scepters and swords
And a parliament of Lords

51:33.920 --> 51:35.797
But on the inside he was sad
Egad!

51:35.960 --> 51:37.837
Because he never had
a wisdom for numbers

51:37.920 --> 51:38.909
A wisdom for words

51:39.080 --> 51:40.115
Though his crown
was quite immense

51:40.240 --> 51:41.355
His brain was smaller
than a bird's

51:41.440 --> 51:43.556
So the queen of the nation
made a royal proclamation

51:43.720 --> 51:44.914
"To the missus
and the messers

51:45.000 --> 51:46.035
"The more or lessers

51:46.200 --> 51:47.349
"Bring me
all the land's professors"

51:47.440 --> 51:48.589
Then she went
to the hair dressers

51:48.760 --> 51:50.910
And they came from the East
And they came from the South

51:51.080 --> 51:52.195
From each college,
they poured knowledge

51:52.280 --> 51:53.349
From their brains
into his mouth

51:53.520 --> 51:54.555
But the king
couldn 't learn

51:54.640 --> 51:55.709
So each professor
met their fate

51:55.840 --> 51:56.875
For the queen
had their heads removed

51:56.960 --> 51:57.949
And placed upon the gate

51:58.040 --> 51:59.029
And on that date

51:59.760 --> 52:01.034
I state their wives
all got a note

52:01.120 --> 52:02.394
Their mate
was now the late great

52:02.560 --> 52:03.549
But then suddenly one day

52:03.680 --> 52:04.795
A stranger started
in to sing

52:04.880 --> 52:05.915
He said,
"I'm the dirty rascal

52:06.000 --> 52:07.035
"And I'm here
to teach the king! "

52:07.120 --> 52:08.235
And the queen
clutched her jewels

52:08.320 --> 52:09.469
For she hated royal fools

52:09.640 --> 52:10.755
But this fool
had some rules

52:10.840 --> 52:11.909
They really ought
to teach in schools

52:12.080 --> 52:13.115
Like you'll be
a happy king

52:13.200 --> 52:14.428
If you enjoy
the things you've got

52:14.520 --> 52:15.509
You should never try to be

52:15.600 --> 52:16.635
The kind of person
that you're not

52:16.720 --> 52:17.869
So they sang
and they laughed

52:17.960 --> 52:19.075
For the king
had found a friend

52:19.280 --> 52:21.748
And they ran onto a rainbow
for the story's perfect end

52:21.920 --> 52:23.911
So the moral is you mustn’t
let the outside be the guide

52:24.080 --> 52:25.115
For it's not so cut
and dried

52:25.280 --> 52:26.269
Well, unless
it's Doctor Jekyll

52:26.360 --> 52:27.349
Then you better hide

52:27.440 --> 52:28.429
Petriﬁed!

52:28.600 --> 52:29.919
No, the truth
can’t be denied

52:30.040 --> 52:31.029
As I have now
have testiﬁed

52:31.200 --> 52:32.918
All that really counts
and matters

52:33.000 --> 52:35.878

Shh. It's all right.

57:43.960 --> 57:47.236
You were having a nice
sort of nightmare, I must say.

57:47.440 --> 57:49.954
You were right, Mary Poppins!
A cover is not the book.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.599
We thought they were nice,
but they were mean!

57:51.760 --> 57:53.318
Whatever are you
talking about?

57:53.480 --> 57:54.674
They tried to take Gillie!

57:54.840 --> 57:58.719
NO, Gillie is right here,
sleeping, as you should be.

57:58.880 --> 58:01.269
But it was real!
They stole all our things...

58:01.440 --> 58:02.589
and the wolf said
we were never

58:02.680 --> 58:03.874
going to see our home again!

58:04.080 --> 58:05.399
That is absurd.

58:07.920 --> 58:10.115
But I had a nightmare
like that, too.

58:10.280 --> 58:12.714
So did I.
It seemed awfully real.

58:13.520 --> 58:15.829
I don't want to lose our home.

58:17.200 --> 58:18.838
You see, Georgie?

58:18.920 --> 58:20.990
That's why we wanted
Mother's bowl.

58:21.160 --> 58:23.993
We were going to sell it
to save the house.

58:26.560 --> 58:28.232

58:35.360 --> 58:36.554
Oh, listen
to the three of you.

58:36.640 --> 58:38.437
You're all worrying
far too much.

58:38.600 --> 58:43.549
After all, you can't lose
what you've never lost.

58:44.360 --> 58:46.078
I don't understand.

Well...

58:47.680 --> 58:52.549
(SINGING) Do you ever
lie awake at night?

58:53.480 --> 58:58.554
Just between the dark
and the morning light

58:59.120 --> 59:04.478
Searching for the things
you used to know

59:05.120 --> 59:10.717
Looking for the place
where the lost things go?

59:11.400 --> 59:16.599
Do you ever dream
or reminisce ?

59:17.080 --> 59:22.154
Wondering where to ﬁnd
what you truly miss?

59:22.520 --> 59:27.878
Well, maybe all those things
that you love so

59:28.520 --> 59:34.436
Are waiting in the place
where the lost things go

59:34.960 --> 59:40.432
Memories you've shared,
gone for good you feared

59:40.600 --> 59:43.353
They're all
around you still

59:43.440 --> 59:46.910
Though they've disappeared

59:47.640 --> 59:53.033
Nothing's really left
or lost without a trace

59:54.200 --> 01:00:00.719
Nothing’s gone forever,
only out of place

01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:07.429
So maybe now the dish
and my best spoon

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:13.718
Are playing hide and seek
just behind the Moon

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:20.152
Waiting there
until it's time to show

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.633
Spring is like that now

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:27.315
Far beneath the snow

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:34.193
Hiding in the place
where the lost things

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.598
Go

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.592
Now, time to get some sleep.

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.954
And in the morning,
bright and early...

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.473
we'll take that bowl
to my cousin.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.879
We'll have it mended.

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:53.279
Time to close your eyes

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.637
So sleep can come around

01:00:56.840 --> 01:00:58.478
For when you dream

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:03.236
You'll ﬁnd all that's lost
is found

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.439
Maybe on the Moon

01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:10.269
Or maybe somewhere new

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:17.039
Maybe all you're missing
lives inside of you

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:24.753
So, when you need her touch
and loving gaze

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:31.192
"Gone but not forgotten "
is the perfect phrase

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:38.228
Smiling from a star
that she makes glow

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:41.429
Trust she's always there

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.471
Watching as you grow

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:53.111
Find her in the place
where the lost things

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.431
Go

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:36.879
John, look!

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:41.794
Mary Poppins' scarf.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.550
It wasn't a dream after all.

01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.917
Shall we tell her?

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.749
Better not.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.636
I expect she already knows.

give Jack one of those flyers.

I don't know
if you remember me.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.149

when I'd see you

there are cars crossing!

someone at this bank

who could help us
save our house.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.914
I'm sure
Father's already asked.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:21.354
Well, we haven't.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.509
Maybe we could get them

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.919
to see things
from a new point of view.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.911

I'd like to see Mr. Michael...

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.913
I'll need a signature
for those, sir.

Excuse me a moment.

You hurt his feelings.

don't you, Georgie?

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.196
Yes. They're the lawyers.

He's the nice one.

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.948

to help us.

nearly that amount

would be so good
for business, eh?

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.118
I wonder, Mr. Wilkins,
if, perhaps...

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.157
as Michael Banks
is an employee,

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.992
you might consider
giving him a few more weeks.

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.593
And lose our chance
to get that house?

stop running around

that we broke Mother's bowl.

we've only made it worse.

why would you ask me?

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.831

the way, after all.

NO, we weren't. I mean,
we are in a fog, but...

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.589
We were only talking.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:48.637
Yes, too focused
on where you've been

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:49.869
to pay attention
to where you're going.

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:51.473
But Father told us
to go straight home!

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.675
He'll be furious
if we're late.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.035
Not much to be done
about that now, is there?

01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:56.719
Are we lost, then?

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:58.393

on where you want to go.

all the glum faces?

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.671
Lost Sixpence
and found a penny?

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.795
We've made a mess
of everything.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.869
Father's furious with us.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.560
And we can't find
our way home.

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:10.869
Lost?

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.268
Are you, Mary Poppins?

Hopelessly.

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.591
Well, now, I'm no expert...

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.233
but if ever I lose my way,

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:21.709
I just look for a little light
to guide me.

01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:27.673
(SINGING) Let's say
you're lost

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.228
In a park, sure

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:34.433
You can give in
to the dark, or

01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.558
You can trip a little light
fantastic with me

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.151
When you're alone
in your room

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.312
Your choice is just
embrace the gloom

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.600
Or you can trip a little
light fantastic with me

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.757
For if you hide
under the covers

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.309
You might
never see the day

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.711
But if a spark can start
inside your heart

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:04.359
Then you can always
ﬁnd the way

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.280
So when life
is gettin’ dreary

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.795
Just pretend
that you're a leerie

01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:13.794
As you trip a little
light fantastic with me

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:14.995
What's a leerie?

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.469
Why, it's what we lamplighters
call ourselves, of course.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.991
Time to send up
the call to arms.

01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:23.829
Leeries, trip the light
to lead the way!

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:28.713
Now, when you're stuck
in the mist, sure

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.950
You can struggle
and resist, or

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:34.430
You can trip a little
light fantastic with me

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.759
Now, say you're lost
in the crowd, well

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.990
You can stamp
and scream out loud, or

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:43.550
You can trip a little
light fantastic with me

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.792
And when the fog
comes rollin' in

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.554
Just keep your feet
upon the path

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:51.154
Mustn't mope and frown
Or worse, lie down

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.992
Don ’t let it be
your epitaph

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:55.435
So, when life
is gettin’ scary

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:57.556
Be your own illuminary

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.395
Who can shine their light
for all the world to see

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.394

light fantastic with me

the world looks bright

He 's got the gift
of second sight

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.718
LEERIES: To trip

What are you all
doing here so late?

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:57.397
We've been waitin'
to see you off, sir.

01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:58.993
We'd be here no matter
what the hour.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.713
MISS LARK:
If you or your family

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.153
should ever need
a place to stay...

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.715
Willoughby and lwould be
happy for the company.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:06.233
That's very kind of you,
Miss Lark.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.833
Jane's offered to put us up
in her flat...

01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:09.109
at least for the time being.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.350
NO, forever,
for as long as you'd like.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:13.033
I wish you'd come
with us, Ellen.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.599
Oh, don't you worry about me.

01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:17.360
I got a nice room fixed up
at my sister's.

01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.478
You won't leave us,
will you, Mary Poppins?

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:20.995
Oh, don't be silly.

01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:23.355
She says she's not leaving
until the door opens.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.152
In any case,
your home is with us.

01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.950
I'm pleased she got caught
on your string, Georgie.

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.109
My kite!

01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:30.189
I forgot my kite!

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.958
Very well,
but be quick about it.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:33.473
The Admiral's got something

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.790
he would like to give you,
Mr. Banks, sir.

l commanded her myself.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.512
May she guide you
safely into port.

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.193
Thank you very much, Admiral.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.471
I will take
very good care of her.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.832

JOHN: Bye, Willoughby.

01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:59.354
Oh, I'm not sure that's gonna
get off the ground anymore.

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:01.511
It looks more glue than kite.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.755
Georgie...

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:05.070
did you patch this up
with one of my Old drawings?

01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:08.069
It looks like you've done
a fine job, there.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.435
Look.

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:10.794
Can you see?

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:13.589

we've been looking for!

to get to the bank!

01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:32.955
What's the time? Anyone?

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.109
Um, seven minutes to midnight.

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.235
Seven minutes?
It's not enough time.

01:40:35.320 --> 01:40:36.435
We need to be at the bank
by midnight.

01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.828
-Take the van.
-No, it's no good.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.194
You still wouldn't
make it in time.

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.429
-Well, what can we do?
-Oh...

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.158
Nothing.
We can't turn back time.

01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:43.355
ANNABEL: Why not?

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:45.154
Everything is possible.

Mary Poppins?

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.513
Can we turn back time?

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:54.869

that couldn't be arranged.

It's nonsense.

Foolishness!

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:02.356

all talking about?

Never you mind about that.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.195
You just get that kite
to the bank...

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.157
as fast as possible,
and leave the rest to us.

ready the bicycle.

I'll take the reins this time.
Speed is of the essence.

it be from riding an elephant?

joining us tonight.

Just hang onto my sleeve

It gets harder to frown
