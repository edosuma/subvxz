09:25.097 --> 09:27.930
Sa... Sass... as...

09:28.000 --> 09:29.558
Pete... sa...

09:29.635 --> 09:31.432
Oh, my mind!

09:31.504 --> 09:34.439
LSP wasn't trying to say
"Pete Sa-something."

09:34.507 --> 09:36.532
She was trying to say "pizza"
something!

09:36.609 --> 09:40.238
But how would pizza sauce
end up in a hotel room?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.747
Unless it was
delivered.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.544
[Both breathing heavily]

09:44.617 --> 09:47.279
BOTH:
Pizza Sassy's!

09:47.353 --> 09:49.287
Where is the delivery
guy?!

09:49.355 --> 09:50.947
Oh, you mean Petey.

09:51.023 --> 09:54.288
He's out.
He's making deliveries.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.193
Or maybe he's out
tying up loose ends.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.356
[Gasps]
LSP could be in dange-r-r-r-r!

09:59.432 --> 10:02.162
Dange-r-r-r-r!

10:02.234 --> 10:04.668
- Phone?
- Phone.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.500
[Panting]

10:06.572 --> 10:08.506
[Imitates phone dialing]
Princess!

10:08.574 --> 10:11.202
Add some banana guards outside
of LSP's hospital room.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.505
Huh? Why?

10:12.578 --> 10:14.239
LSP could be in
danger!

10:14.313 --> 10:16.975
LSP woke up and
went back to her hotel room.

10:17.049 --> 10:19.108
Oh, my J-i-i-i-i-im!

10:19.185 --> 10:20.812
BOTH:
He's already here!

10:20.886 --> 10:23.514
[Both screaming]

10:23.589 --> 10:24.886
Can I help you?

10:24.957 --> 10:25.981
BOTH:
LSP!

10:26.058 --> 10:27.355
[Both scream]

10:27.426 --> 10:29.257
LSP:
Ow! Ow! Hey! Hey, no!

10:29.328 --> 10:31.990
Oh, no!
What are you doing?!

10:32.064 --> 10:33.031
It was you.

10:33.099 --> 10:35.567
- You did it!
- Help me!

10:35.635 --> 10:37.728
I was just delivering
the pizza she ordered,

10:37.803 --> 10:39.600
and now she won't
let me leave.

10:39.672 --> 10:41.936
LSP, what is going
on?

10:42.008 --> 10:44.568
You said he stole something
from you.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.043
Well, he did!

10:46.112 --> 10:47.511
He stole...

10:47.580 --> 10:48.604
my heart!

10:48.681 --> 10:51.047
[Sobbing]

10:51.117 --> 10:51.981
Hurry up, dude!

10:52.051 --> 10:54.713
- Shh!
- Right.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.550
Hoo! Thanks!

10:56.622 --> 10:58.749
- Shh!
- Go! Go!

10:58.824 --> 11:00.758
No tip, huh?
That's great.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.192
That's how it is around here.
Fine.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.492
Huh? Huh?
Come on, pal.

11:05.564 --> 11:06.895
Turns out the only case here

11:06.966 --> 11:09.833
is just another case of LSP
being nutty.
