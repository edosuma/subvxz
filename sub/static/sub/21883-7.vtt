WEBVTT

01:08.902 --> 01:10.987
The first meeting of the president elect

01:11.071 --> 01:14.699
with the U.S. President
took place at the White House.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.618
And it lasted for more than an hour.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.705
<i>This is the first trip that</i>
<i>the president elect has taken,</i>

01:20.789 --> 01:24.167
two weeks before
his presidential inauguration in Mexico.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.544
DECEMBER 1, 2006

01:26.628 --> 01:32.592
<i>I swear to abide by</i>
<i>and enforce the Constitution</i>

01:32.967 --> 01:35.345
<i>of the United Mexican States...</i>

01:35.428 --> 01:38.056
<i>...and the laws that may come from it.</i>

01:38.306 --> 01:41.643
<i>And to perform, loyally and patriotically,</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:44.479
<i>the role of President of the Republic,</i>

01:44.562 --> 01:46.981
<i>as the people have bestowed upon me.</i>

01:48.108 --> 01:51.486
<i>Looking always for the common good</i>
<i>and prosperity of the people.</i>

01:52.195 --> 01:55.740
<i>And if I fail to carry this out,</i>
<i>may the people demand it from me.</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:01.412
<i>Mister President,</i>

02:01.496 --> 02:05.041
<i>what are your impressions about</i>
<i>the U.S. President's wish</i>

02:05.125 --> 02:07.001
<i>to cooperate with your government</i>

02:07.085 --> 02:10.046
in order to face the drug trafficking
problem in both countries?

02:10.839 --> 02:13.383
Fortunately, our neighboring country
is fully willing.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.261
The President understands
very well Mexico's difficulties.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.180
Specifically, the importance of the fight
against drug trafficking.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.767
Actually, we have begun to discuss
our cooperative strategy.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.937
Could you tell me what
this cooperation would mean?

02:26.396 --> 02:30.942
Well, we need more technology and weapons,
and they can provide them us.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.736
In fact, I told him...

02:33.862 --> 02:37.031
have you seen the show <i>24 </i>with Jack Bauer?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.659
"I want all the toys," I told him.

02:39.742 --> 02:42.245
"I want all the toys for the war
against drug trafficking."

02:44.038 --> 02:46.833
So far, you have given us
your enemies' location

02:47.375 --> 02:49.210
and we have captured them.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.963
But as of now, we are
going a step further.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.174
We are all going to work together.

02:57.176 --> 02:58.219
As a single entity.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.555
If we're controlling the business,

03:00.638 --> 03:02.765
we have to get rid of Cano
in Nuevo Laredo.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.269
The Emes won't stand a chance
against the Federation,

03:06.352 --> 03:08.646
the military, and the police
attacking together.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.782
Joaquín...

03:21.701 --> 03:23.286
we want results soon.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.287
You will have them.

03:25.121 --> 03:26.789
The war against drug trafficking

03:27.206 --> 03:28.499
will be a complete success.

03:42.430 --> 03:46.392
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>From my boiling blood</i>

03:46.976 --> 03:51.105
<i>I feel the fear sweat dripping away</i>

03:51.231 --> 03:55.193
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>That nothing transmits</i>

03:55.860 --> 04:02.116
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

04:02.325 --> 04:05.453
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:06.579 --> 04:10.208
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:10.959 --> 04:14.420
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

04:15.421 --> 04:19.550
<i>To unleash my return</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:28.017
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

04:28.268 --> 04:32.397
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:37.068
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:43.324
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>Come to meet me</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:48.204
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

04:48.288 --> 04:51.249
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

04:52.292 --> 04:55.962
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

04:57.088 --> 05:01.050
<i>To unleash my return</i>

05:37.712 --> 05:40.006
Lieutenant Colonel Davila, from the Army.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.468
And Major Arana from the Federal Police.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.804
The boss sends me to be at your disposal.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.640
Taking over Nuevo Laredo won't be easy.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.267
They are very well organized.

05:52.060 --> 05:56.272
We will need thousands of troops.
Both from the Army and the Federal Police.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.524
When will we get the weapons
we were promised?

05:58.941 --> 05:59.859
I will take care of that.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.946
First, we need all the information
you have on Cano and the Emes.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.157
To set up intelligence.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.787
GUADALUPE RESTAURANT

06:55.456 --> 06:57.125
Take this chance to enjoy yourselves.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.628
This is the last chance to relax
before the battle.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.635
Don't worry.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.139
They are just fooling around
to keep the suspense up.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.569
And this year's queen is...

08:13.826 --> 08:16.120
Miss Elva Coronado.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.872
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you... your new queen,

08:59.956 --> 09:01.958
Miss Elva Coronado.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.274
Thank you.

09:29.026 --> 09:29.902
Thank you.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.470
I have to go.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.682
I have pending business to take care of.

10:01.851 --> 10:02.977
Are you coming back?

10:05.313 --> 10:06.647
Of course, my queen.

10:07.898 --> 10:09.442
I'm coming back to be your king.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.002
When you turn 18...

10:29.086 --> 10:30.463
you will marry me.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.175
I'm going to be waiting for you.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.894
ISMAEL'S RESIDENCE

10:55.363 --> 10:57.740
Thank you for coming to
my son's graduation.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.283
Is he here?

10:59.700 --> 11:00.534
No, not yet.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.287
While we're waiting,
I want to talk to you.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.039
All right.

11:10.961 --> 11:13.381
I want to make Sinaloa
the biggest cartel.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.217
Not only in Mexico but in the world.

11:16.967 --> 11:20.805
And for that we need to expand out there
and control the border from inside here.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.307
You said the government
agrees Nuevo Laredo

11:23.391 --> 11:25.059
should be the first target, right?

11:25.893 --> 11:28.062
There are other borders
besides Nuevo Laredo.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.815
I also want us to get Juarez.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.026
Juarez?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.906
Tell me straight up, Joaquín.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.285
Why do you want to take Chente's sector?
For the business?

11:44.495 --> 11:46.330
Or because you want to
avenge your brother?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.584
Both.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.713
We won't have a better moment.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.382
The government wants dough.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.134
And we have their support.

11:59.427 --> 12:03.055
Controlling Juarez and Nuevo Laredo,
we will be owners of the entire border.

12:08.018 --> 12:08.894
And the business?

12:09.687 --> 12:12.982
Have you thought who to leave it to
while we go to war?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.692
Dámaso will be in charge.

12:22.700 --> 12:23.909
My son is here!

12:30.207 --> 12:33.127
-Congratulations, damn it.
-It's about time.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.672
Congratulations, son.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.303
Thanks a lot, pops.

12:43.012 --> 12:43.846
Joaquín.

12:44.805 --> 12:45.639
What up?

12:45.973 --> 12:47.766
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.311
Your dad told me you
graduated at the top of your class.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.896
I said that, didn't I?

12:52.897 --> 12:54.523
You graduated as an administrator.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.400
Yes, Business Administrator.

12:56.775 --> 12:57.610
Bad ass.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.570
We are going to need you very soon.

12:59.653 --> 13:02.907
We're growing and I need you to
handle our international business.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.074
Cool.

13:04.158 --> 13:04.992
I'm in.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.077
JOAQUÍN'S RESIDENCE

13:07.161 --> 13:11.248
Sol sends word that the government is
spending three billion dollars on weapons.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.669
They're waiting for your attack strategy
to coordinate the military and police.

13:16.420 --> 13:19.673
Tell Conrado that we're also
going for Juarez.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.509
Juarez hasn't been considered, Joaquín.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.219
Only Nuevo Laredo.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.471
We are considering it now.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.557
The government is doing what I suggest.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.393
And I suggest we take both sectors.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.410
You are changing the plans.

13:50.037 --> 13:51.455
What you want is dough.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.374
And I want order in the business.

13:54.542 --> 13:58.212
The entire border under our control
means more dough for everybody.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.258
More dough for everybody...

14:03.092 --> 14:04.677
and absolute power for you.

14:06.720 --> 14:07.846
We all win.

14:10.099 --> 14:10.933
All right.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.728
We'll go after Juarez and Nuevo Laredo.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.189
U.S. weapons just arrived.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.234
The sooner we finish all this, the better.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.671
I have something to tell you.

14:42.798 --> 14:44.174
Chente hasn't arrived yet.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.303
Chente was not invited.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.474
We're no longer doing business
with Juarez.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.229
When was that decision made?

14:57.313 --> 14:58.147
Right now.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.189
Here.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.737
But Chente is a partner.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.196
Not anymore.

15:07.364 --> 15:08.991
I got tired of paying him dues.

15:12.870 --> 15:13.704
Joaquín...

15:14.663 --> 15:17.875
it's too much to fuck over the Emes
and fuck over Juarez at the same time.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.378
Not if we have the military
and the federal police on our side.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.090
We're going to kill two birds
with one stone.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.308
If you don't like the idea,
you may go, Nazario.

15:46.820 --> 15:47.947
Any objections?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.584
The red dots
are the Emes' safe houses.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.252
CAMPO MARTE MILITARY CAMP
MEXICO CITY, MEXICO

16:03.712 --> 16:06.465
The ones for Sinaloa
are located at these coordinates.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.344
And the labs are located here.

16:10.886 --> 16:11.762
We, the Army,

16:12.221 --> 16:15.557
are in charge of attacking the safe houses
and the labs.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.644
The federal police will be
placing check points

16:18.727 --> 16:23.148
all over the highways and at each of
Nuevo Laredo's possible exits.

16:23.565 --> 16:24.566
What about Juarez?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.777
We will attack them in a different way.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.114
On their cocaine routes.

16:30.572 --> 16:33.158
-We're intercepting them on their way?
-That's right.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.833
Another thing, gentlemen.

16:43.127 --> 16:48.007
The Ministerial, State, and Local Police
in these zones...

16:48.966 --> 16:51.635
are on the Juarez Cartel's
and the Emes' side.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.060
Give it to him. It is urgent.

17:01.770 --> 17:02.604
<i>So.</i>

17:02.980 --> 17:03.897
What is the order?

17:04.023 --> 17:06.066
Whoever is against us, we get rid of them.

17:07.943 --> 17:08.986
Is that understood?

17:14.033 --> 17:18.120
CANO'S RESIDENCE

17:29.798 --> 17:32.009
CHENTE'S RESIDENCE

17:37.097 --> 17:37.973
Hello?

17:50.736 --> 17:51.779
It's Cano.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.496
<i>Chente.</i>

18:01.205 --> 18:03.665
Did you know your main partner
is betraying you?

18:05.334 --> 18:08.087
I guess that with El Chapo
it was only a matter of time.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.590
What do you want?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.592
We have to join forces.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.095
El Chapo and the government
are coming down on us.

18:28.732 --> 18:29.650
Soldiers.

18:29.775 --> 18:30.943
<i>At ease.</i>

18:31.110 --> 18:32.236
Attention!

18:33.445 --> 18:34.696
Align!

18:36.573 --> 18:37.741
Attention!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.284
Cover!

18:40.661 --> 18:43.205
<i>We called you here to</i>
<i>inform the public</i>

18:43.288 --> 18:46.041
<i>that today we start strategic exercises</i>

18:46.125 --> 18:49.044
<i>to combat drug trafficking</i>
<i>and organized crime.</i>

18:49.253 --> 18:50.462
DECEMBER 11, 2006

18:50.546 --> 18:55.384
In this operative, we will carry out
illegal weed farm eradication activities.

18:56.009 --> 19:00.264
We will establish control points to
stop drug trafficking on our highways.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.516
We will carry out searches,

19:02.766 --> 19:06.061
locating and dismantling
the drug selling points.

19:06.687 --> 19:11.024
With a deployment of more than
4,260 members of the Army,

19:11.567 --> 19:13.527
seventeen fixed-wing airships,

19:13.986 --> 19:16.363
twenty-nine rotatory-wing airships,

19:16.613 --> 19:18.949
and 246 land vehicles,

19:19.950 --> 19:23.120
who will be joined by 1,400
additional personnel...

19:23.203 --> 19:27.249
<i>...of which 300 are</i>
<i>supporting federal forces,</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:30.878
<i>three hundred are regional security,</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:33.046
<i>along with another 220...</i>

19:33.130 --> 19:36.175
With the government on our side,
nobody can stop us.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.013
Cano and Chente won't know what hit them.

19:41.221 --> 19:46.560
All of this makes a total
of 1,425 police officers.

19:48.979 --> 19:49.813
Let's go.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.782
I know that restoring security
will be neither easy nor fast.

20:01.575 --> 20:02.910
<i>It will cost a lot of money.</i>

20:05.537 --> 20:08.415
<i>Unfortunately, it will cost human lives.</i>

20:10.042 --> 20:11.043
<i>My promise...</i>

20:11.543 --> 20:15.797
<i>was to look after the tranquility and</i>
<i>security of all the Mexican people.</i>

20:15.881 --> 20:17.049
<i>And I will do just that.</i>

20:26.767 --> 20:28.977
<i>I repeat to the public...</i>

20:30.145 --> 20:34.233
<i>that the battle against organized crime</i>
<i>is a priority for my government.</i>

20:35.734 --> 20:36.693
And we're going to win!

20:41.156 --> 20:44.076
TWO MONTHS LATER

20:45.577 --> 20:49.122
It has been two months since
the so-called "war on drugs" started.

20:50.791 --> 20:55.170
<i>The first military action has already</i>
<i>mobilized thousands of Army troops</i>

20:55.254 --> 20:56.838
<i>against suspected criminals.</i>

21:02.552 --> 21:06.056
<i>The confrontations between the</i>
<i>government and organized crime</i>

21:06.139 --> 21:08.892
<i>in Juarez and Nuevo Laredo</i>
<i>haven't stopped.</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:14.147
<i>Nor have the casualties.</i>

21:15.649 --> 21:17.943
<i>The results are not what</i>
<i>the government expected.</i>

21:57.274 --> 21:58.859
I need to talk with your boss.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.243
It's Sol.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.873
Hello?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.791
<i>This has got out of hand, Joaquín.</i>

22:15.250 --> 22:16.293
It's a mess.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.296
This isn't the moment to back off.

22:19.796 --> 22:22.215
Tell your president that this
has just begun.

22:30.348 --> 22:33.143
You assured me that if we backed up
the one in Sinaloa,

22:33.226 --> 22:34.644
this would be over soon.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.146
Two months.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.316
Two months and we don't have
either of those two sectors.

22:39.941 --> 22:41.526
The press is blasting me!

22:41.610 --> 22:43.528
Corruption has made
things difficult for us.

22:43.945 --> 22:46.281
Our institutions are fragmented.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.742
Even within the Army there are some
who are with us

22:48.825 --> 22:50.577
and others who are with the cartels.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.830
That's why they knew about
our attack points.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.540
It's a free-for-all.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.754
The Emes and the Juarez' have bought
people from the government.

23:01.797 --> 23:05.300
<i>They have reinforced their relationships</i>
<i>with governors and mayors,</i>

23:05.383 --> 23:08.887
<i>so that they can protect them and</i>
<i>won't give up information about them.</i>

23:10.222 --> 23:11.139
Get it?

23:11.848 --> 23:14.351
We have information leaking
from our own people.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.104
That's why our operations have failed.

23:18.605 --> 23:21.316
<i>They bought the chiefs</i>
<i>of the local police</i>

23:21.483 --> 23:23.985
<i>and the chiefs of their state police</i>
<i>in their zones.</i>

23:24.611 --> 23:27.364
And now they are bribing
the military squad officers.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.491
And the federal police, too.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.952
As I said, Mr. President...

23:32.744 --> 23:34.371
Corruption is killing us.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.666
Things are getting harder
than they thought.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.960
Government guys are getting very nervous.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.504
Together, Chente and Cano are strong.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.298
We need more information
about their weaknesses.

23:45.757 --> 23:46.967
Especially the Emes.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.178
-We are using all the info we got.
-Not all of it.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.347
There is someone who
knows them from the inside.

23:52.722 --> 23:53.640
Someone who hates them.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.102
But who hates Cano the most because
he took his place.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.200
They are here, sir.

24:13.827 --> 24:14.661
Let them in.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.067
I'm only speaking with you.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.778
I don't speak with workmen.

24:52.908 --> 24:55.202
Nuevo Laredo was
you and your brother's zone.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.205
You have valuable information about
Cano and the Emes.

24:58.538 --> 25:00.665
What do you want in exchange for the info?

25:01.041 --> 25:01.875
Nothing.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.629
I have pending business with Cano.
And I'm going to settle it.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.465
But the one responsible for
what is happening is you.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.384
You told me on the phone
you were willing to negotiate.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.721
I wanted to have you here
and tell you to your face.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.557
You betrayed Raciel.

25:17.891 --> 25:21.561
And if my brother hadn't been jailed,
Cano wouldn't have taken power.

25:22.562 --> 25:25.565
You made your own bed, Chapo.
Now lay on it.

25:26.399 --> 25:27.859
Let's go.

25:28.068 --> 25:30.570
This jackass is wasting our time.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.085
Here is the list of authorities bought by
Chente and Cano, sir.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.218
Governors,

25:54.135 --> 25:55.345
mayors,

25:55.428 --> 25:57.305
congressmen, federal police officers...

25:58.014 --> 26:00.016
I used to get hookers with these assholes.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.894
These dogs are worth whatever
you throw at them.

26:03.478 --> 26:06.231
Let's make them come
to their senses and join our side.

26:07.023 --> 26:10.026
We are not stopping until we win this war
and get the business.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.280
Let's go with the first on the list.

26:17.575 --> 26:21.371
Three hundred federal officers arrived

26:21.788 --> 26:23.581
right in the hotel on the highway.

26:23.665 --> 26:25.292
JORGE LÓPEZ ARIAS
GOVERNOR OF CHIHUAHUA

26:25.375 --> 26:28.795
I sent my state police to
give false information about

26:29.212 --> 26:30.505
your safe houses.

26:31.172 --> 26:34.426
What is really difficult to avoid is...

26:35.385 --> 26:38.972
the highway control
and the merchandise confiscation.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.432
You know the Army is there.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.186
Chente...

26:46.896 --> 26:48.189
I need some more money.

26:48.606 --> 26:50.066
You know the people...

26:50.608 --> 26:53.570
ask for their piece of the pie
to keep me updated.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.863
And to help you.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.661
Since when are you so
shy about it, governor?

27:06.249 --> 27:07.417
Give him more dough!

27:26.686 --> 27:28.104
You keep helping us...

27:30.065 --> 27:32.025
and we keep being generous.

27:33.276 --> 27:34.110
Got it?

27:43.161 --> 27:44.496
<i>We are being followed.</i>

28:16.861 --> 28:18.071
You work for me now.

28:18.154 --> 28:19.489
And if you don't obey,

28:19.739 --> 28:21.658
the next bullet will be
through your forehead.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.249
MAYOR OF TAMAULIPAS

28:43.513 --> 28:45.348
They shot the Mayor.

28:55.775 --> 28:58.361
<i>They also gunned down the federals</i>
<i>that were with us.</i>

29:05.535 --> 29:06.953
Talk with your people.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.915
And tell them that from now on you work
for El Chapo and the Army.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.886
And the governor of Chihuahua
no longer answers to Chente.

29:31.811 --> 29:33.021
Gather your people.

29:34.689 --> 29:37.150
Time to show fucking Chapo
and the government

29:37.233 --> 29:38.735
that they can't mess with us.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.502
My king.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.681
ARTURO'S RESIDENCE

31:45.111 --> 31:46.738
Arturo, come downstairs.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.457
The governor of Chihuahua is not dead.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.293
We persuaded him to work with us.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.471
We need you alert, dumb-ass.

32:12.430 --> 32:15.058
Nobody knows these
assholes' bad habits better than you.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.435
This war is not easy.

32:17.810 --> 32:19.646
We have to keep working our asses off.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.192
We are close.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.195
Very close.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.133
There they go!

33:03.022 --> 33:07.402
EL CHAPO'S TERRITORY

34:16.804 --> 34:18.639
Don't take me, no!

34:41.120 --> 34:42.330
No, Mama!

36:09.333 --> 36:15.298
CHAPO, EVEN WITH ALL THE MILITARY AND
FEDS, YOU CAN'T DEFEAT US. THE EMES

37:20.655 --> 37:23.824
<i>Last night, multiple attacks</i>
<i>were reported against civilians</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:25.660
<i>in multiple cities in Durango.</i>

37:25.743 --> 37:31.707
<i>In one savage attack, 15 men and women</i>
<i>were found dead inside a truck.</i>

37:31.791 --> 37:35.044
<i>And early this morning,</i>
<i>a group of Emes hitmen</i>

37:35.127 --> 37:38.047
<i>shot all the residents of a small town,</i>
<i>and setting their homes on fire.</i>

37:39.632 --> 37:44.971
<i>This is the first killing spree against</i>
<i>innocent civilians during this war.</i>

37:45.846 --> 37:49.725
<i>The Emes left a banner where collusion</i>
<i>with the government is insinuated...</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:58.734
They made us look like
real dumb-asses, Joaquín.

38:00.152 --> 38:03.114
He wants to pressure the government
so they back off.

38:04.407 --> 38:05.700
Give me the phone.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.378
Conrado.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.008
The message in the banner
involves us directly, Joaquín.

38:22.633 --> 38:26.095
The press will ask why are we only
attacking Juarez and Gulf's territory.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.265
Send me your troops
with Postela to cover it up.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.893
<i>I will let them know so they give</i>
<i>them something to confiscate.</i>

38:33.978 --> 38:35.896
But this doesn't solve the problem.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.736
There is only one possible answer
to what Cano has done.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.074
Do what you have to do.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.913
Do we have people close in Nuevo Laredo?

38:54.332 --> 38:55.416
Yes.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.088
Nobody can stop this now, Arturo.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.965
Eye for an eye.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.634
We are answering tonight.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.454
Attaboy!

39:33.537 --> 39:36.665
You already had three.
And I'm not carrying you to your house.

39:38.167 --> 39:39.418
Cheers, cheers.

39:39.502 --> 39:40.336
Let me see.

39:41.087 --> 39:41.962
For you.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.424
Guys, I'm going to the restroom.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.634
I'll go with you.

39:46.717 --> 39:47.843
OK, cool.

39:48.969 --> 39:50.262
But don't take too long!

39:54.767 --> 39:57.853
Another beer and we got them.

41:09.216 --> 41:10.926
You were well hid, pretty one.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.970
Please, please wait!

41:13.053 --> 41:14.430
No, please, please!

41:14.513 --> 41:15.890
I beg you!

41:16.098 --> 41:18.100
Please don't kill me!

41:19.143 --> 41:21.854
No, no!

41:23.898 --> 41:26.567
No! No!

41:26.650 --> 41:27.943
No!

41:28.944 --> 41:29.862
Please!

41:29.945 --> 41:31.697
Please, let me go!

41:31.780 --> 41:33.657
Dani! No!

41:43.167 --> 41:45.169
