02:25.179 --> 02:26.702
Great day to watch a game.

02:26.703 --> 02:30.813
But first things first.
More important things to do.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.882
Thomas to Stevens.

02:40.361 --> 02:42.358
ETA 1700.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.220
Thank you.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.667
The Cherokees and the Mammoths
with the right to go on to the playoffs.

02:53.668 --> 02:57.140
And their biggest fan, President Harmon,
who hasn't missed a game all season...

02:57.141 --> 02:59.040
is not here today.
Can you believe it?

02:59.041 --> 03:00.908
It's true, Dave.
But for a good reason.

03:00.909 --> 03:02.981
Instead he's attending the
National Merit Awards...

03:02.982 --> 03:04.549
at Arlington University.

03:04.550 --> 03:08.017
And I got a feeling that somehow he's
gonna get to a radio or television.

03:08.018 --> 03:11.249
- There's no way he's gonna miss this one.
- You're absolutely right, Ernie.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.882
And I believe that we are
set now for the kickoff...

03:13.883 --> 03:17.094
and you are about to see it live.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.908
So, Alex...

03:33.180 --> 03:37.550
- who won the last game?
- I did, Mr. President.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.152
That makes three in a row?

03:42.189 --> 03:46.256
- Yeah. Honey?
- Oh, yes.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.725
It's too bad that this
speech had to be today...

03:50.726 --> 03:54.266
since it's the last home game you
could officially see as President.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.198
But they're gonna be a
lot more fun to watch...

03:56.199 --> 03:58.770
when I don't have to run a
country at the same time.

03:58.771 --> 04:03.242
Oh, boy, state dinners every
night do get a bit old.

04:03.243 --> 04:08.175
I can hardly wait to curl up on the
couch with a box of Krispy Kremes.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.010
Alex.

04:13.487 --> 04:17.019
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- You're welcome.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.510
Okay. The other side, ma'am.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.749
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.365
And here's Mr. Stevens.

05:02.603 --> 05:06.101
Stevens! Mr. Stevens!

05:06.273 --> 05:07.705
Okay, thanks.

05:07.706 --> 05:09.839
Excuse me.

05:11.778 --> 05:17.006
The President has decided to spend a
few minutes with you upon his arrival.

05:17.050 --> 05:18.880
And he should be here shortly.

05:18.881 --> 05:22.386
Mr. Stevens, is the President
backing the Vice President?

05:22.387 --> 05:26.090
Mr. Stevens, can you
tell us about security?

05:28.495 --> 05:30.822
We're on approach.

05:34.101 --> 05:36.098
Excuse me.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.548
Gun!

07:13.934 --> 07:16.465
Get Air Med over here!

07:33.253 --> 07:36.649
Get Air Med over here, now!

07:54.174 --> 07:58.742
We're en route to your location with
the President of the United States.

07:58.745 --> 08:01.645
He has a gunshot wound to
the head, one entry wound.

08:01.646 --> 08:03.408
Patient is trauma-coded.

08:03.409 --> 08:06.686
We have a large-bore
IV running wide open.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.014
ETA is in five minutes.

08:19.066 --> 08:22.090
I'm just gonna go to the closest
hospital. I guess that's where...

08:22.091 --> 08:25.000
- they're gonna take him.
- All right.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.205
And let me know if you need anything.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.908
Okay, thanks. I'll call you
as soon as I have something.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.447
There they are. Let's go.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.319
Hurry up. This way.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.322
- Secured.
- Locking.

08:59.606 --> 09:01.869
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You have an
open wound. You're not sterile.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.874
I can't leave his side.
He's my responsibility.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.637
In here, he's my responsibility.

09:05.638 --> 09:07.474
Nurse, take him to the ER.

09:07.475 --> 09:10.841
I'll be with him all the way through.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.000
You're a lucky man. X-ray
looks good. No broken bones.

10:01.001 --> 10:05.000
Take it easy on the hand for
a few weeks. You'll be fine.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.594
Feels like forever.

10:36.970 --> 10:40.935
- How's the hand?
- Fine, thank you, ma'am.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.169
Alex.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.506
You were there.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.657
How was he?

11:03.864 --> 11:06.498
Alex, please talk to me.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.166
It didn't look good.

11:26.152 --> 11:29.047
I need a minute to myself.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.285
Doctor...

11:33.994 --> 11:37.326
- would you please inform the press?
- Of course.

11:37.327 --> 11:39.427
Thank you.

11:42.235 --> 11:45.199
Ma'am, I'm sorry for your loss.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.531
If you need a few private
moments with him...

11:49.643 --> 11:52.743
I don't want to see him like that.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.957
Special Agent Thomas?

12:10.830 --> 12:13.764
Hi, I'm Kate Crawford from
the Washington Inlander.

12:13.765 --> 12:16.001
I know who you are.

12:16.002 --> 12:19.471
Then talk to me.
You might need a friend.

12:19.472 --> 12:21.400
Let's go.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.127
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.736
How did you get into
his army records?

12:59.846 --> 13:02.810
Never mind. I don't want to know.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.618
Your sources, have they
given you anything?

13:06.619 --> 13:10.315
Well, the Secret Service had him
on file as a Class Three threat case.

13:10.316 --> 13:11.411
Crank letter writer.

13:11.412 --> 13:13.748
Then how the hell did he get
anywhere near the President?

13:13.749 --> 13:16.685
Because they don't assign agents
to high-level threat cases...

13:16.686 --> 13:21.023
unless they live in the immediate area.
Detimore's not from here.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.598
So you don't know anything that
anybody else doesn't know.

13:24.599 --> 13:27.473
Bite me, Peter. The guy's a ghost.

13:27.474 --> 13:30.169
He has no bank statements,
he has no credit records.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.072
He paid his rent in cash.

13:32.073 --> 13:35.078
And, oddly enough, his personal
history's been erased...

13:35.079 --> 13:38.076
since he left the army in '92.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.078
I'm gonna go back to the campus.

13:41.079 --> 13:44.519
See if I can talk to anyone
who saw him yesterday.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.383
Get a different take on it.

13:47.961 --> 13:53.064
Fine, but I want daily reports.
Not your usual out-of-contact-for-weeks.

13:56.703 --> 13:59.928
You know, an e-mail
would also work for me.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.143
It's not gonna last
forever, you know?

14:14.144 --> 14:18.788
Don't worry about it, Bri.
I understand procedure.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.390
To be honest with you...

14:21.391 --> 14:23.961
I could use the time to get
my head on straight...

14:23.962 --> 14:25.826
think things through.

14:25.827 --> 14:29.668
Hey, hey, cut yourself
some slack, man.

14:30.703 --> 14:35.965
We've gone over every second of that day.
You did everything by the book.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.569
Stevens was looking for you earlier.

14:42.649 --> 14:46.910
Listen. If you need
anything, call me.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.711
Okay?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.023
Come in.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.024
I heard you were looking for me, sir?

15:00.025 --> 15:03.533
Agent Thomas, I know you're
required to take time off.

15:03.534 --> 15:05.830
But keep in touch,
because when all this clears...

15:05.831 --> 15:07.872
- I'm gonna need you back.
- Yes, sir.

15:07.873 --> 15:11.541
And do not blame yourself
for what happened.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.742
It wouldn't have changed direction if
it didn't go through my hand first, sir.

15:15.743 --> 15:17.948
Now, listen.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.186
You took a bullet for the man.
Nobody can ask for more than that.

15:22.187 --> 15:24.216
Yes, sir.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.549
Please stop at that area,
but just stay back.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.683
Thank you.

15:55.889 --> 15:59.080
- That's far enough.
- All right. Okay.

16:01.060 --> 16:03.789
Don't mind him.
He's always out here begging.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.360
He won't bother you.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.633
Okay. Thanks.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.570
Excuse me?

16:16.376 --> 16:17.843
Hi.

16:17.844 --> 16:22.640
- May I talk with you for a minute?
- Arthur Fuller's the name.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.840
My friends call me Shakey.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.509
My name's Kate.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.157
- Cool kicks, Shakey.
- Zip-a-dee-doo.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.257
It's a look.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.496
Were you here when the
President was assassinated?

16:38.497 --> 16:40.390
Yeah.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.734
Bad scene.

16:42.735 --> 16:46.063
Did you see the shooter
here, that day?

16:55.048 --> 16:56.737
No.

16:58.051 --> 17:00.309
Not around here.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.177
Wait, wait. Sorry?

17:03.223 --> 17:05.917
When you say that you didn't
see him around here...

17:05.919 --> 17:07.958
do you mean that you
haven't seen him at all...

17:07.959 --> 17:09.823
or that you've seen
him somewhere else?

17:09.824 --> 17:11.327
I've seen him where he lived.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.865
Where? Where have you seen him?

17:13.866 --> 17:18.297
Well, for $20, I'll show you.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.152
Shangri-la.

17:34.153 --> 17:38.584
- You sure he was living here?
- Scout's honor.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.783
Cross my heart.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.424
- That's my home away from home.
- It's nice.

17:45.425 --> 17:48.324
Yeah, wait until you see the inside.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.302
Hey, boss. You got company.

17:56.303 --> 17:59.134
- How many?
- Two. Man and a woman.

18:04.684 --> 18:08.444
Your boy was living
there about a week.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.518
Did you tell anyone else about this?

18:11.519 --> 18:16.988
No. Nobody ever asks me nothing.
I don't volunteer nothing.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.456
Yeah.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.731
Okay, look.

18:24.871 --> 18:27.998
Can you stand out here and keep watch?
Let me know if anyone comes, okay?

18:27.999 --> 18:30.074
- I can do that.
- All right.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.076
Buy yourself a couple of
beers or something. Okay?

18:33.077 --> 18:35.346
I don't drink.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.674
Okay.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.921
I'll give you another $20
when I come out, okay?

18:46.922 --> 18:48.618
Yeah.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.471
- Hey.
- Hey, boss.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.817
Listen, a last question.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.918
Did you ever see him with anyone?

20:22.155 --> 20:26.420
Oh, yeah. Yeah, twice. Twice!
I seen a guy go into the place.

20:26.421 --> 20:28.220
Okay, great, that's great.

20:28.221 --> 20:30.794
- Would you recognize him again?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:30.795 --> 20:33.055
- Did you run her plates?
- Yes, sir.

20:33.056 --> 20:36.334
Give me a few hours and
I'll have her life's history.

20:37.904 --> 20:41.134
Look, I gotta go, okay?
But thank you.

20:41.135 --> 20:43.230
- Thank you for all your help. All right?
- Yeah.

20:43.231 --> 20:46.211
- Okay.
- Come back, I'll buy you dinner.

20:46.212 --> 20:49.312
Okay. How much will that cost me?

21:14.841 --> 21:17.240
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's Kate. Okay, listen.

21:17.241 --> 21:19.606
Detimore wasn't working
alone on this thing.

21:19.607 --> 21:23.813
A third party rented him
an apartment. They paid cash.

21:23.850 --> 21:28.047
Two weeks before the shooting, it's near
campus and it's under a false name.

21:28.048 --> 21:30.348
And I met a guy named Shakey...

21:30.349 --> 21:34.826
and he lives in a van behind the building,
but he swears he can ID him.

21:34.827 --> 21:40.031
Shakey? Let me guess.
Drunk, needs a shower, not all there.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.727
Yeah, but he knows what
he saw and I believe him.

21:42.728 --> 21:44.927
And listen, I went
into the apartment...

21:44.928 --> 21:50.008
and I found cough syrup,
and bloody tissues, and painkillers.

21:50.009 --> 21:51.376
Which means?

21:51.377 --> 21:55.240
Which means he had lung cancer.
I saw the same thing with my mom.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.542
Right.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.586
So maybe the guy wanted
to go out in a blaze of glory.

22:01.587 --> 22:03.110
Or someone found out and used him.

22:03.111 --> 22:05.189
Go back to Shakey's,
find out what else he knows.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.015
Okay.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.947
- Hold it, ma'am.
- Kate Crawford, Washington Inlander.

22:37.948 --> 22:39.849
Okay.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.059
Hold it.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.877
Okay, this goes in the back.
I'll radio ahead.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.514
So, Shakey tells me that
he can identify someone...

23:03.515 --> 23:05.515
that's going in and out of
Detimore's apartment...

23:05.516 --> 23:07.983
and, the next thing you know,
he's killed in a fire.

23:07.984 --> 23:09.485
That's not a coincidence.

23:09.486 --> 23:12.580
If he was murdered,
you're playing with big-boys rules now.

23:12.581 --> 23:14.181
I've played big-boy rules before.

23:14.182 --> 23:16.385
Yeah, and my head ended
up on the chopping block.

23:16.386 --> 23:19.663
Yeah, but we also won a Pulitzer.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.859
True.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.669
But this Pulitzer could
end up killing you.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.620
Maybe we should bring
in the authorities.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.681
No. Come on, not yet. It just...

23:31.683 --> 23:35.068
They'd only shut me out
and then I'd have nothing.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.242
I located his sister.

23:37.243 --> 23:41.713
She... She lives near Warren.
I'm gonna go see her tomorrow.

23:46.659 --> 23:50.658
Listen, Kate. Be careful.

23:52.465 --> 23:56.464
Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.
I'll see you later.

24:23.629 --> 24:27.162
Get Air Med over here, now!

24:34.206 --> 24:36.708
- Hi.
- Alex, please.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.345
Now that he's gone,
you're the only one I can talk to.

24:40.346 --> 24:42.513
Not right now.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.058
Hold on.

27:14.066 --> 27:17.530
- Are you Thelma Detimore?
- And you are?

27:17.770 --> 27:21.962
I'm Kate Crawford from
the Washington Inlander.

27:23.209 --> 27:26.609
Look, I been talking to the
cops all day and I'm tired.

27:26.610 --> 27:29.747
You here to make him
into a monster, too?

27:29.748 --> 27:33.342
- I'm here to get the truth.
- He was a good brother and a good son.

27:33.343 --> 27:35.783
- Who is it, Thelma?
- A reporter.

27:35.784 --> 27:38.681
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.114
Is that your mother?

27:40.115 --> 27:43.494
She's an old lady who
just outlived her son.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.662
Leave her be.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.358
Okay.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.935
You know what? Just one question.

27:54.974 --> 27:57.869
How long was he taking these?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.310
Long enough.

28:02.882 --> 28:07.040
Got it during the Gulf War.
At least that's what he always said.

28:07.653 --> 28:11.122
All right, look, if you
think of anything...

28:11.123 --> 28:15.486
you know, you'd like me to know or...
Just give me a call.

28:15.861 --> 28:18.028
I'll do that.

28:18.497 --> 28:20.687
Okay, bye-bye.

28:27.606 --> 28:31.434
Delia, could you give me
a hand with this, please?

28:39.518 --> 28:42.209
Follow her and find
out who she talks to.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.324
Thelma, the TV's broke.

29:38.711 --> 29:41.641
Mom! We gotta get out.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.368
- Sir.
- Martin.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.741
Very nice turnout.

30:09.742 --> 30:13.044
- Where's Thomas?
- At home, I'm sure.

30:13.045 --> 30:16.414
Taking a little time to get
himself together, sir.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.605
Understandable.

30:18.751 --> 30:21.282
It's a difficult time.

30:33.332 --> 30:38.435
- How's the investigation going?
- We're in the opening stages.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.731
A lot of questions to be asked,
people to interview.

30:41.732 --> 30:44.637
The big question is how did
he get through the security?

30:44.638 --> 30:46.209
I have my top people on it, though.

30:46.210 --> 30:48.938
Your top people are the ones that
screwed it up in the first place.

30:48.939 --> 30:51.777
- You know, with all due respect, sir...
- Stuff it.

30:51.778 --> 30:55.219
He was a very close,
personal friend of mine...

30:55.220 --> 30:59.447
not to mention that he
was a damn fine leader.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.958
Now, I want this thing cleared up.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.531
I thought you were retired, General?

31:06.532 --> 31:10.034
You want to find out how
little that really means?

31:10.035 --> 31:12.002
Good afternoon, everyone.

31:12.003 --> 31:15.105
I just want to thank you
all for coming today.

31:15.106 --> 31:18.175
And I know that all of
your condolences...

31:18.176 --> 31:23.077
both on a personal and professional level,
would have meant a great deal to him.

31:23.078 --> 31:25.783
And I also hope that in time...

31:25.784 --> 31:29.048
this sorrow will turn into
an enduring memory...

31:29.049 --> 31:33.483
of all of his great accomplishments
while serving as your President.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.940
Mr. Thomas?

31:53.946 --> 31:55.806
Hello?

32:08.627 --> 32:10.658
Mr. Thomas?

32:13.665 --> 32:15.525
Hello?

32:20.506 --> 32:22.332
Hello?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.974
Hello?

32:40.959 --> 32:42.527
Shit.

32:42.528 --> 32:44.661
Good morning.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.855
Long night, huh?

32:53.038 --> 32:56.764
I was wondering if I could
just talk to you...

32:57.442 --> 32:59.575
for a second?

33:12.891 --> 33:17.049
Listen, I just need to
speak to you for a moment.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.466
Look who she's run to now.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.794
- Trouble.
- Yeah.

33:24.903 --> 33:26.934
Call Jack.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.439
- Yeah?
- She's with Alex Thomas.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.049
That's a shame.

33:38.050 --> 33:42.550
I gave her opportunity after
opportunity to go away, didn't I?

33:43.288 --> 33:46.123
I don't have a choice,
so just make them both go away.

33:46.124 --> 33:47.984
Thomas.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.455
Look.

33:54.099 --> 33:57.393
Detimore wasn't working
alone in this.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.759
I can prove it.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.863
Come on!

34:11.949 --> 34:13.947
I'm coming in.

34:31.603 --> 34:36.330
- Well, is this your wife?
- That's none of your business, Crawford.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.944
Pretty lady.

34:57.362 --> 34:59.090
You were close to the President.

34:59.091 --> 35:02.092
You're just wasting your time.

35:42.441 --> 35:45.302
You'll forgive my cynicism...

35:45.444 --> 35:49.875
but I don't buy into any grassy-knoll,
second-gunman theory.

35:54.286 --> 35:56.817
I was there. Remember?

35:58.323 --> 36:03.323
Well, what about the someone-
put-a-dying-man-up-to-it theory?

36:03.995 --> 36:06.764
You really should be going now.

36:06.765 --> 36:09.130
You know, Thomas,
you don't have to like me.

36:09.131 --> 36:12.691
But you know my reputation.
I'm not some bright-eyed rookie.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.361
Rookie? No, no.

36:14.362 --> 36:17.270
You have plenty of experience
destroying people's careers...

36:17.271 --> 36:18.967
for your personal gain.

36:18.968 --> 36:21.768
Only when they deserve it.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.049
Okay, fine. I'll leave.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.219
Explain this to me though, will you?

36:28.220 --> 36:31.086
Why would someone rent an
apartment for Detimore...

36:31.087 --> 36:33.213
two weeks before the
National Merit Awards...

36:33.214 --> 36:35.724
one week before the White
House announces...

36:35.725 --> 36:38.462
the President's going to be there?

36:38.463 --> 36:41.393
You just mull that over, okay?

36:42.968 --> 36:47.900
Oh, and the bum who showed me the
apartment is dead, as of yesterday.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.111
Okay.

37:08.326 --> 37:10.391
- Okay.
- Okay.

37:12.697 --> 37:16.264
Can we get my purse?
I left it on the dock.

37:21.640 --> 37:26.174
- So, why me?
- Because I need your help.

37:26.211 --> 37:29.509
And there's a conspiracy here
and I know you're not involved.

37:29.510 --> 37:32.714
Wait. Why are the lights still on?

37:34.953 --> 37:38.444
Okay, I don't mean to be rude, Thomas,
but you really need to fix this.

37:38.445 --> 37:41.282
In case you have company here.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.257
Keep your eyes on the water.

38:18.258 --> 38:21.725
- Shoot them if they come back up.
- Okay.

39:22.727 --> 39:25.490
I knew. I told you.
I told you I was being followed.

39:25.491 --> 39:27.556
Aren't you supposed to
listen to your instincts?

39:27.557 --> 39:30.226
- Crawford... Calm down. Calm down.
- What? Okay. I'm calm.

39:30.227 --> 39:32.529
You're supposed to listen to
your instincts and I always do.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.797
I always say, "Just listen to
your instincts, Kate, listen."

39:34.798 --> 39:36.805
And I didn't listen.
And whenever you don't listen...

39:36.806 --> 39:39.171
- things happen, bad things happen...
- Relax. They're gone.

39:39.172 --> 39:42.109
They're go... There's one right there.
What do you mean, they're gone?

39:42.110 --> 39:43.681
Come on.

39:43.682 --> 39:46.115
You need to check the trees,
then check the car.

39:46.116 --> 39:49.153
And can you get my purse, please?

39:49.154 --> 39:51.151
Thank you.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.837
Excuse me, sir.

40:20.051 --> 40:23.178
- You should've stayed and backed them up.
- I'm sorry.

40:23.179 --> 40:27.788
- Like I said, I don't do wet work.
- Yeah, you did, didn't you?

40:31.262 --> 40:34.465
All right, so we take
a different approach.

40:34.466 --> 40:39.102
We find out who can lead them
to us and we just get there first.

40:44.209 --> 40:46.642
- Thanks for doing this for me.
- No problem.

40:46.643 --> 40:49.508
The police ID'd the guys who
tried to kill you yesterday.

40:49.509 --> 40:52.776
Eli Arman. Arrested twice
for illegal arms dealing.

40:52.777 --> 40:57.013
And his pal, Nick Gower,
no convictions. But I got lucky.

40:57.014 --> 41:00.214
Their sidekick on the
second bust, Tony Morino...

41:00.215 --> 41:03.327
is doing 10 years at the federal pen.

41:03.328 --> 41:05.989
- Is there any way that you could...
- They're expecting you.

41:05.990 --> 41:08.697
Here's your clearance.

41:59.050 --> 42:02.446
Eli Arman. He's dead.

42:03.221 --> 42:04.653
I'm all broke up.

42:04.654 --> 42:08.152
Who were you and Eli
smuggling guns for?

42:08.493 --> 42:12.861
- All right, what's in this for me?
- You got eight years left, no parole.

42:12.862 --> 42:16.762
I can get you out of this rat hole
and into a minimum-security facility.

42:16.763 --> 42:21.595
- And for this I got to do what?
- Just answer the fucking question.

42:29.214 --> 42:33.784
Me and Nick Gower worked for Arman.
But he wasn't running the show.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.679
Who was?

42:37.756 --> 42:39.950
I don't know. It's compartmented.

42:39.951 --> 42:41.354
This way, if one guy got busted...

42:41.355 --> 42:43.756
he didn't take everybody
else down with him.

42:43.757 --> 42:48.195
Now, Arman, he worked for Mike Maguire,
and he reported to the top guy.

42:48.196 --> 42:50.698
Where do I find this Mike Maguire?

42:50.699 --> 42:54.463
Last I remember, he was
living in the DC area...

42:54.464 --> 42:58.709
liked to hang out at a place
called the Stars and Stripes Café.

42:58.710 --> 43:01.769
- So when am I getting out of here?
- As soon as your information checks out.

43:01.770 --> 43:03.547
Let's go.

43:09.287 --> 43:11.284
Thank you.

43:14.159 --> 43:18.795
- You visited a Thelma Detimore yesterday?
- Yeah, why?

43:19.464 --> 43:22.155
Her trailer was blown up.

43:25.603 --> 43:29.067
- What about her mom?
- She was in it.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.468
Oh, my God.

43:35.413 --> 43:38.916
That's three people dead
because I went to go talk to them.

43:38.917 --> 43:42.108
It's not gonna get any better, Kate.

43:49.928 --> 43:53.620
Good girl, Janice. Mike Maguire.

43:55.400 --> 43:58.933
Mike Maguire. Mike Maguire?

44:00.271 --> 44:04.600
You know, this guy looks so familiar
to me. I just can't place him.

44:06.911 --> 44:10.079
You think he's gonna show up today?

44:10.415 --> 44:14.278
His favorite haunt.
Good a place to start as any.

44:15.220 --> 44:18.013
It's a needle in a haystack.

44:25.997 --> 44:30.030
Hey, looks like our
needle just showed up.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.578
Oh, my God.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.454
Move!

45:00.932 --> 45:02.933
Call the cops.

45:02.934 --> 45:06.501
Hello? Yes. A man just
ran by me with a gun.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.866
Get out!

45:10.008 --> 45:12.676
53-31, copy that.

45:44.075 --> 45:47.471
Freeze! Freeze!

45:48.913 --> 45:51.604
Here comes my little hero.

45:52.650 --> 45:55.318
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

46:02.694 --> 46:06.261
Freeze! Drop your gun, now!

46:07.699 --> 46:09.131
Secret Service!

46:09.132 --> 46:11.063
Put your gun down, now!

46:11.064 --> 46:13.329
- Secret Service. Check the ID.
- Put the gun down, now!

46:13.330 --> 46:16.129
Step over to the car, sir.

46:20.678 --> 46:22.440
This is 53-31 calling.

46:22.441 --> 46:26.239
We apprehended an armed man,
Special Agent Alex Thomas.

46:27.919 --> 46:29.847
Look out!

47:00.418 --> 47:04.388
- I owe you one.
- Maguire's dead.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.386
He's dead.

47:06.824 --> 47:09.890
- Thomas, you're bleeding.
- Yeah.

47:11.429 --> 47:13.460
Sir, are you okay?

47:23.374 --> 47:25.841
The tags were stolen off
a Beamer three days ago.

47:25.842 --> 47:27.876
But that bumper you described...

47:27.877 --> 47:31.778
is a chrome, titanium steel,
drop bumper, very rare.

47:31.779 --> 47:34.544
Only 35 body shops are
qualified to install them.

47:34.545 --> 47:36.278
Only one in DC.

47:36.279 --> 47:37.876
I accessed their records...

47:37.877 --> 47:41.355
and a company called Alexis
International came up as the owner.

47:41.356 --> 47:43.927
Good girl. What else you got?

47:43.928 --> 47:47.497
Very little. Import-export,
unlisted number.

47:47.498 --> 47:49.324
May I?

47:50.034 --> 47:53.225
Thanks. Alexis rings a bell.

47:53.771 --> 47:57.171
I think maybe their name
may have come up...

47:57.172 --> 47:59.943
in an article I wrote years ago.

48:00.645 --> 48:03.340
- What's ISG?
- Intelligence Studies Group.

48:03.341 --> 48:07.645
Top secret CIA unit that was busted
for doing internal operations.

48:07.646 --> 48:10.378
Illegal internal operations
in this country.

48:10.379 --> 48:13.554
And how is ISG tied in to Alexis?

48:13.791 --> 48:15.725
Okay. May I?

48:15.726 --> 48:18.922
These three guys were
questioned about ISG.

48:18.923 --> 48:21.190
They denied having any
knowledge of it whatsoever.

48:21.191 --> 48:24.968
But, the three of
them were employed...

48:24.969 --> 48:27.027
by Alexis International. Okay?

48:27.028 --> 48:31.899
A company with no credit history,
no financial records whatsoever.

48:33.911 --> 48:37.774
- And I knew I recognized him.
- Mike Maguire.

48:38.382 --> 48:40.076
Same guy, different name.

48:40.077 --> 48:42.977
- Can you enlarge that guy's face?
- Sure.

48:43.654 --> 48:46.083
That's Philip Keefer.

48:46.958 --> 48:49.192
That's the driver.

48:49.193 --> 48:51.918
- From today?
- Yes.

48:52.730 --> 48:56.194
I gotta take this in
to Stevens tomorrow.

48:56.834 --> 48:58.762
It's him.

49:06.177 --> 49:08.071
Come in.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.910
Agent Thomas, how are you
holding up? How's the hand?

49:14.911 --> 49:17.277
Fine, thank you.

49:17.788 --> 49:19.118
And so what are you doing here?

49:19.119 --> 49:22.191
I don't think Detimore
was working alone, sir.

49:22.192 --> 49:25.591
- What makes you think that?
- I've been in contact with Kate Crawford.

49:25.592 --> 49:28.163
Oh, a conspiracy theory.
I see, I'm sorry, I didn't...

49:28.164 --> 49:30.529
Who is it this time,
the FBI or the CIA?

49:30.530 --> 49:33.159
Or maybe the Secret Service?
That'd be a new wrinkle.

49:33.160 --> 49:37.566
It was somebody, sir.
They tried to kill us both yesterday.

49:37.909 --> 49:40.177
- Are you kidding me?
- No, sir.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.073
- You have any idea who?
- Maybe.

49:43.181 --> 49:46.012
Some company named Alexis
International is involved,

49:46.013 --> 49:48.570
but I think that's just a shell.

49:50.588 --> 49:52.145
Vaughn, I need 15 men.

49:52.146 --> 49:54.951
Alex, hold on a second. You know
that I cannot authorize that for you.

49:54.952 --> 49:57.219
- You shouldn't even be here.
- You always could count on me.

49:57.220 --> 49:59.818
Listen, this is...
This is bigger than us.

49:59.819 --> 50:04.060
This is the FBI, the CIA, the NSA.
They all have their hands in this.

50:04.061 --> 50:05.600
- We can't move on this alone.
- Ten.

50:05.601 --> 50:09.661
Now, give me a couple of days
and I'll see what I can do.

50:09.662 --> 50:11.866
- 10 men is all I...
- Two days...

50:11.867 --> 50:15.167
and I will do my best, Agent Thomas.

50:15.246 --> 50:17.004
Okay.

50:17.648 --> 50:22.114
And until then,
you will stay out of this.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.100
General Montgomery, sir.

51:10.101 --> 51:11.534
Alex.

51:11.535 --> 51:15.932
When am I gonna see you?
What's wrong, son?

51:16.807 --> 51:18.997
You're kidding.

51:19.410 --> 51:23.341
I'll look into it. I'll see
what I can do for you.

51:23.981 --> 51:27.083
What about Martin?
Have you talked to him?

51:27.084 --> 51:31.185
No, I know you don't want
to get him involved in it...

51:32.456 --> 51:37.092
but this young man would climb
Mount Everest barefooted for you.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.188
I think he's your best bet.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.290
You're welcome.

51:45.436 --> 51:49.196
Hey, come over and see me sometime.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.172
God bless.

52:02.053 --> 52:07.452
This is a lot bigger than a single gunman.
You obviously got somebody worried.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.216
I'm not so sure.

52:11.062 --> 52:13.821
How's the First Lady doing?

52:14.265 --> 52:18.132
Remarkable lady. I mean, we all
know how tough it's been on her...

52:18.133 --> 52:22.330
but she seems to be doing okay,
you know, wanting to get on with her life.

52:22.331 --> 52:25.802
That morning when
we were in the car...

52:26.344 --> 52:30.914
I gave her a look that everything
was gonna be okay, you know?

52:30.915 --> 52:32.673
Yeah.

52:33.017 --> 52:34.775
Then when it happened...

52:39.890 --> 52:42.625
I just can't forget her face.

52:42.626 --> 52:45.794
Having to leave her husband's side.

52:47.531 --> 52:50.961
- Have you called her, man?
- No.

52:51.869 --> 52:55.697
But I'm gonna stop by and
see her when this is all over.

52:57.141 --> 53:00.571
How quickly can you
get a team together?

53:06.450 --> 53:08.617
Four or five hours.

53:08.886 --> 53:10.011
What does that mean...

53:10.012 --> 53:12.315
you don't know how long
you'll be able to hold him back?

53:12.316 --> 53:16.524
I thought you were omnipotent,
almighty, and powerful.

53:19.130 --> 53:23.698
So who's got my back, after I
clean up your mess? Tell me that.

53:27.004 --> 53:29.433
I do love this game.

53:30.307 --> 53:33.703
Hey, guys, finish up, okay?
Let's go. We gotta get out of here.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.903
Here they come.

53:52.963 --> 53:55.221
Let's get going.

54:06.210 --> 54:09.470
When's the next run supposed to be?

54:10.414 --> 54:12.775
God, they're fast.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.485
Very fast.

54:15.486 --> 54:18.655
I didn't think they'd
get here that quick.

54:18.656 --> 54:22.382
And boys, let's go have some fun.

54:54.325 --> 54:57.259
Kate, I don't know what we're
gonna be up against in there...

54:57.260 --> 55:00.530
so I'm gonna need you
to stay in the car.

55:00.730 --> 55:01.815
Okay.

55:27.825 --> 55:29.651
West side, report.

55:29.727 --> 55:31.494
West side, clear.

55:31.495 --> 55:35.164
- Thomas, assessment.
- They've been tipped-off.

57:09.059 --> 57:11.750
Just like the fourth of July.

57:12.162 --> 57:14.193
Okay, hero.

57:15.132 --> 57:17.390
Present for you.

57:48.465 --> 57:50.632
Bomb! Get out!

58:14.558 --> 58:17.720
Hey! Come on!

58:17.721 --> 58:20.291
- Help me!
- Open up!

58:20.397 --> 58:23.861
Oh, I'm burned! I'm burning down!

58:45.489 --> 58:47.383
Thomas!

59:29.833 --> 59:33.525
- What the hell happened?
- You better buckle up.

59:43.247 --> 59:45.972
Son of a bitch.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:18.540
Here, have this on
your conscience, then.

01:00:21.752 --> 01:00:24.215
Please don't hit him!

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:33.021
Car. Car. Car!

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.572
Bus. Thomas, there's a bus.

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:57.285
Okay, you see the kids?

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.887
It's gonna be on your head.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:09.589
Thomas, stop! Thomas, bus! Stop!

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:14.704
Stop! It's a bus!

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.531
So what're you gonna do?

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.601
There are children on it!
Stop! Let him go!

01:01:23.914 --> 01:01:26.605
Well, you lose, you son of a bitch.

01:01:34.224 --> 01:01:37.825
- Bang!
- Bye-bye.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.434
Thank you. Thank you.

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:03.481
- You might want to stay here.
- What?

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:09.516
What?

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:21.833
What in the... This is not good.

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:28.003
- What are you doing?
- I owe him one.

01:02:28.004 --> 01:02:31.714
Not good. This is not good!
This is not good!

01:02:31.715 --> 01:02:33.473
Shit!

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.902
Stevens.

01:02:52.903 --> 01:02:56.138
Miss Crawford,
would you excuse us, please?

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:58.504
What did I tell you this morning?
Give me two days, did I not?

01:02:58.505 --> 01:03:01.041
- It was my idea, sir.
- Shut up. Did I not say that this morning?

01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:03.634
- It's all my idea, sir.
- Really? Then how come you knew...

01:03:03.635 --> 01:03:06.010
that the assassin's accomplice
would be in that warehouse?

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:07.946
- because I told him, sir.
- That's right.

01:03:07.947 --> 01:03:11.220
- And he's only a suspect.
- What are our losses?

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:14.947
Two dead, two wounded,
one critically burned and in IC.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:19.821
- Is he gonna pull through?
- Yes, thanks to Thomas, he has a chance.

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:26.227
Off the record. Off the record.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:31.974
You two... Three, did a hell
of a job out there today.

01:03:32.376 --> 01:03:34.707
Okay, what's the deal with
this guy, the suspect...

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.004
or "not the suspect"?

01:03:36.005 --> 01:03:38.046
Still unconscious and
in critical condition.

01:03:38.047 --> 01:03:39.546
All right. Well,
we'll need him alive.

01:03:39.547 --> 01:03:42.351
- Call me when he can talk.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:44.046
- Miss Crawford.
- Mr. Stevens.

01:03:44.047 --> 01:03:47.652
- Can I speak with you, please?
- Of course.

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:53.192
Wonder Woman. Remarkable
what you did today, thank you.

01:03:53.193 --> 01:03:54.387
I appreciate that.

01:03:54.388 --> 01:03:56.294
And you have an article
to write, do you not?

01:03:56.295 --> 01:03:58.901
Yes, and a very good one, at that.

01:03:58.902 --> 01:04:03.766
Now, since you're so intimately
involved in all of this...

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:09.239
could you spare the details to the
public, until I get to the bottom of it?

01:04:09.379 --> 01:04:11.437
The public has a right to know.

01:04:11.438 --> 01:04:16.184
I'm not ordering you. I wouldn't,
I couldn't. I'm asking you.

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:21.524
And in return, I will give you
an exclusive one-on-one with me.

01:04:21.525 --> 01:04:24.216
- Before anyone else?
- Yes.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.495
- Full disclosure?
- Yes.

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:28.561
- Deal.
- Deal.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:36.517
What did he say?

01:04:36.518 --> 01:04:39.637
Well, overall, I'd say
it went pretty well.

01:04:39.643 --> 01:04:42.641
For now. Let's get out of here.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:46.982
Hey, take my car.

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:49.849
I'll find another ride.
Look after it, will you?

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:52.120
Thanks, Brian.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.814
This way.

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:20.607
Pull!

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:27.747
Pull!

01:05:29.359 --> 01:05:31.788
Great shot, General.

01:05:32.596 --> 01:05:34.888
Thank you, Alex.

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:40.536
I didn't realize you were
bringing a journalist with you.

01:05:40.537 --> 01:05:42.295
Sir.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:46.274
- Miss Crawford. No offense.
- None taken, General.

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:49.278
We're working together
on this one, sir.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:52.081
Really? What you got for me?

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.807
His name is Philip Keefer.

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:59.246
I put him in the hospital yesterday.

01:06:02.225 --> 01:06:04.760
His name is Jack Baldwin.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:07.292
- Not Keefer?
- No.

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:11.629
He's a former contract
employee for the CIA.

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:15.765
You mean contract killer?

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:20.037
Ten years ago, he was
a deputy director's man.

01:06:20.038 --> 01:06:23.679
He virtually ran the ISG.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.574
General?

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:29.944
Who was the deputy director
of operations then?

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:32.210
Vaughn Stevens.

01:06:32.689 --> 01:06:34.583
Stevens?

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:39.461
I know where you're headed with this,
but I'll stake my reputation.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:43.158
The CIA had nothing to do with
the assassination of the President.

01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:47.265
As a matter of fact, the President
was very close to the CIA.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:50.534
What's curious about all this is...

01:06:51.241 --> 01:06:53.135
Baldwin.

01:06:53.843 --> 01:06:57.808
I mean, even with him in the
picture, there's no motive.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:02.245
Question is, who would
gain the most...

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:06.181
by the death of the President?

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:12.252
Like to stay for breakfast?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:17.461
That's very generous of you, sir,
but I think it's best we get going.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:21.098
- All right.
- Thank you again, General.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:24.834
Remember, the deeper you dig...

01:07:25.275 --> 01:07:28.375
the less you're gonna
like what you find.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.434
...understand that, right?

01:07:59.435 --> 01:08:03.541
Of course I understand. I'm in the
middle of it as much as you are.

01:08:03.747 --> 01:08:05.304
Why didn't you try
calling me or something?

01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:06.881
- I will, I'll call you Thursday.
- Okay.

01:08:06.882 --> 01:08:08.244
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:08:08.245 --> 01:08:10.643
Until then, stiff upper lip.
All right?

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:16.143
Miss Crawford,
aren't you here a bit early?

01:08:16.144 --> 01:08:18.924
It was light traffic.
Sorry to have surprised you.

01:08:18.925 --> 01:08:22.060
- Who was that?
- No one important.

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.566
Really?

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:28.804
Because it looked like Judy
Fincher from WestLake Publishing.

01:08:28.805 --> 01:08:32.433
You wouldn't be thinking about reneging
on our promised interview, would you?

01:08:32.434 --> 01:08:34.532
I had heard that your editor
pulled the story. So?

01:08:34.533 --> 01:08:35.904
- Really, you heard that?
- Yeah.

01:08:35.906 --> 01:08:38.881
That's odd, I didn't hear that.
Who told you?

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:40.849
Surely, you of all
people should know...

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.474
that the grapevine in this
town reaches a lot of walls.

01:08:43.475 --> 01:08:46.986
Well, did the grapevine also
tell you that I'm a freelancer?

01:08:46.987 --> 01:08:48.988
So I can give my story
to anyone who wants it.

01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:51.924
Let me just make this as clear to you
as I possibly can, Miss Crawford.

01:08:51.925 --> 01:08:55.292
I am not at liberty to discuss
Philip Keefer. My hands are tied.

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:57.421
- That will not happen.
- That's okay.

01:08:57.423 --> 01:09:01.024
Because I'm actually going to
change the angle of the article...

01:09:01.026 --> 01:09:03.895
- and do it on Jack Baldwin.
- Good.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.437
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:09.773
Hello? Yes. I can be right there.

01:09:09.774 --> 01:09:11.402
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:09:11.403 --> 01:09:15.540
- I'm so sorry. Can I reschedule?
- Of course.

01:09:15.541 --> 01:09:17.219
Thank you.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:19.511
- Hi, Brian.
- Kate.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:24.654
- What did she want?
- Nothing. Just being a reporter.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:17.079
- Hello.
- It's Agent Thomas.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.809
Alex. How you doing?

01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:21.417
I'm doing.

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:25.781
- I'm really sorry about everything.
- Yeah, me, too.

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:30.282
You meant a lot to him.

01:10:30.283 --> 01:10:34.221
- He was gonna divorce her and marry you.
- I know.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:36.865
I just want the President to be...

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:40.202
remembered as a good
President and not...

01:10:40.203 --> 01:10:42.461
Still protecting him, huh?

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.397
Well, don't worry, Agent Thomas.

01:10:44.398 --> 01:10:46.474
What happened between
me and the President...

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:49.972
will stay between me
and the President.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:53.148
No one else needs to know.

01:10:53.149 --> 01:10:54.917
Thanks.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:58.314
- If you ever need anything...
- I won't.

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:00.215
Thanks.

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:38.318
Alex, what a surprise.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.998
You never forget a thing, do you?

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:47.469
- What have you been up to lately?
- Oh, just working on my boat.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:50.934
- And you?
- Working on my art.

01:11:51.374 --> 01:11:53.837
I'm nearly finished.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:56.841
Been waiting to show it to you.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:02.677
What do you think?

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.085
I think a lot of things,
to be honest.

01:12:12.529 --> 01:12:16.130
Like maybe there wasn't
just one lone gunman.

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:18.691
What do you mean?

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:21.267
We have a suspect in the hospital.

01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:25.199
Whatever is going on,
we'll find out soon enough.

01:12:30.113 --> 01:12:32.713
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:12:33.283 --> 01:12:35.541
It is beautiful.

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.149
You're too close.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:46.654
You can't see it.

01:12:49.299 --> 01:12:52.763
You have to see it from
the right perspective.

01:13:04.614 --> 01:13:06.576
Try mine.

01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.100
Wow. That is truly amazing.

01:13:25.101 --> 01:13:28.634
So, are any of these powdered?

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:34.099
- Have I ever brought you anything else?
- No.

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.451
Take care of yourself.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:02.664
- Here you go.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:18.209
Perfect timing.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.059
Thank you.

01:14:40.610 --> 01:14:43.141
Who won the last game?

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:49.116
Are those framed checks?

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.577
Yeah.

01:15:25.555 --> 01:15:27.813
I'm sorry, Alex.

01:15:33.463 --> 01:15:35.221
Yeah.

01:16:03.493 --> 01:16:05.894
You know what burns my ass?

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:10.588
The fact that Baldwin is still in
the hospital and he's still alive.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:30.851
Thomas, why are you
watching that morbid tape?

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:34.681
We confiscated tapes from
five different cameras.

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:37.889
I'm sure I'm missing something.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:45.531
- What is that?
- Well it's... My cell phone is dying.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:49.804
So, I went to interview
Stevens today...

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:54.274
and I saw the publisher, Judy
Fincher, coming out of his office.

01:16:54.275 --> 01:16:57.445
I don't know what that's all about.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.845
But I told him that I was
changing the angle of my story...

01:16:59.846 --> 01:17:03.140
from Philip Keefer to Jack Baldwin.

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:06.418
And I could tell it shook him up.

01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:16.795
Wait, stop. Pause it. Stop.

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:20.592
Do you see that?

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:25.401
- Detimore is so close to Stevens.
- Yeah, close enough to get a gun.

01:17:25.402 --> 01:17:28.408
Call the police, the FBI, somebody,
we have to arrest him.

01:17:28.409 --> 01:17:33.705
It's not enough to arrest him, but it's
definitely enough to confront him.

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:35.146
- Brian.
- Yeah?

01:17:35.147 --> 01:17:38.353
- Find out where Stevens is right away.
- Okay, call you back.

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.282
Let's go.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.354
You coming?

01:17:43.192 --> 01:17:44.881
No.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:49.560
I can't go with you. We're the
only two that know about this.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:55.066
If you don't come back, I'm the
only one who knows the truth.

01:18:00.943 --> 01:18:04.669
Well, then, I guess the
tape's in good hands...

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.042
partner.

01:18:15.057 --> 01:18:16.614
- Martin.
- Yeah.

01:18:16.615 --> 01:18:18.750
- He's at home.
- How do you know he's there?

01:18:18.751 --> 01:18:20.350
Well, you know Stevens.

01:18:20.351 --> 01:18:24.091
Whenever the wife is out of town,
things get busy at the mansion.

01:18:24.092 --> 01:18:26.629
Okay, I'm on my way.

01:18:55.498 --> 01:18:57.563
Vaughn, sir?

01:19:03.973 --> 01:19:06.300
It's Agent Thomas.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:09.042
Are you here?

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:22.689
Vaughn? It's Agent Thomas.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.626
Vaughn?

01:19:46.082 --> 01:19:49.910
- Alex, everything all right?
- In here.

01:19:58.094 --> 01:19:59.920
Jesus.

01:20:06.335 --> 01:20:08.798
Looks like a suicide.

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:12.172
Or someone wants us to think that.

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:16.510
When I pulled up,
I saw a woman driving away.

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:20.179
- Get forensics up here.
- I'll make the call.

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:28.254
- Hello.
- Kate, Jesus Christ, where've you been?

01:20:28.255 --> 01:20:29.617
- No calls, no fax.
- I know.

01:20:29.618 --> 01:20:31.021
I even told you an e-mail would work.

01:20:31.022 --> 01:20:33.526
Yes. I'm sending you an e-mail
right now with the whole story.

01:20:33.527 --> 01:20:34.720
Yeah, right.

01:20:34.721 --> 01:20:38.196
Okay, listen, this thing is so much
bigger than any of us thought.

01:20:38.197 --> 01:20:42.793
Okay, every lead that I've gone to
is dead. And I almost joined them.

01:20:42.794 --> 01:20:45.099
- What?
- So, I'm typing it right now.

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.238
You should get it momentarily.

01:20:47.243 --> 01:20:49.802
Listen, I gotta go. My phone
is running out of juice.

01:20:49.803 --> 01:20:53.046
- No, don't hang... Don't.
- Okay, bye.

01:20:55.518 --> 01:20:57.280
There were several
fluids on his shorts...

01:20:57.281 --> 01:21:00.081
but there were no other prints
found at the scene, other than his.

01:21:00.082 --> 01:21:04.552
Stevens was murdered.
No way it was a suicide.

01:21:04.727 --> 01:21:07.452
Some woman fled the scene.

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:10.999
Wait a minute.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.832
Crawford said she saw him earlier
today with Judy Fincher...

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:15.926
some well-known publisher.

01:21:15.927 --> 01:21:20.105
I remember her now. She was
with Stevens at the wake.

01:21:21.277 --> 01:21:22.743
- Janice.
- Yes?

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:26.147
Find out what you can
on a Judith Fincher.

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:29.715
- F-I-N-C-H-E-R.
- Right away, Alex.

01:21:32.121 --> 01:21:33.747
All right. So what do we have?

01:21:33.748 --> 01:21:38.259
Detimore is dying of cancer,
hired to kill the President.

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.886
Gives the money to his family.

01:21:39.887 --> 01:21:43.131
Baldwin comes in to clean
up any loose ends.

01:21:43.132 --> 01:21:46.498
Videotape shows that he probably
got the gun from Stevens.

01:21:46.499 --> 01:21:49.998
Not to mention a fake press pass.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.701
Stevens would be the perfect
one to engineer it.

01:21:53.702 --> 01:21:57.369
Stevens used to handle Baldwin.
Probably got him to do the dirty work.

01:21:57.370 --> 01:21:59.037
All the evidence points to Stevens...

01:21:59.038 --> 01:22:01.843
making him the only real
loose end to tie up.

01:22:01.844 --> 01:22:03.417
Yeah, but why?

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:06.243
What does he have to gain?

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:10.658
Money? Power? He had plenty of both.

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.054
Well, why do men do anything?

01:22:14.063 --> 01:22:17.823
- Women.
- Right, women.

01:22:18.467 --> 01:22:21.026
- What do you got?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

01:22:21.027 --> 01:22:24.003
Graduated Yale Law,
went straight into publishing.

01:22:24.004 --> 01:22:25.595
Pretty standard bio.

01:22:25.596 --> 01:22:28.574
I printed out some pictures and
a complete business history.

01:22:28.575 --> 01:22:31.412
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:33.171
Here.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.701
Martin here. What?

01:22:54.702 --> 01:22:56.793
Took down two agents
before he escaped.

01:22:56.794 --> 01:22:58.634
We need you over here right away.

01:22:58.635 --> 01:23:01.204
I'll be right there.

01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:04.808
Baldwin killed two agents at
the hospital and disappeared.

01:23:04.809 --> 01:23:06.881
- And they had the place surrounded.
- Let's go.

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:09.313
If he manages to escape and finds
out that Stevens is dead...

01:23:09.314 --> 01:23:10.816
he's gonna come after
you and Crawford.

01:23:10.817 --> 01:23:14.180
Head over to the hospital.
I'll call if I need backup.

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:33.198
Answer the phone.

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:38.035
Hello.

01:23:38.036 --> 01:23:39.841
Is everything all right?

01:23:39.842 --> 01:23:41.006
Yeah, everything's fine, why?

01:23:41.007 --> 01:23:43.044
Baldwin just escaped.

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.810
What? Thomas, I can't...

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:46.746
Hello?

01:23:50.793 --> 01:23:52.551
Shit.

01:24:07.843 --> 01:24:09.669
Hello.

01:24:23.292 --> 01:24:25.323
Flashlight.

01:24:40.242 --> 01:24:42.243
Hello, beautiful.

01:24:42.244 --> 01:24:44.438
Help me understand something.

01:24:44.439 --> 01:24:47.172
With all the horrible things
going on in the world...

01:24:47.173 --> 01:24:49.684
why do you concentrate...

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:52.949
on a man who's not worth his
weight in fertilizer, huh?

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:56.451
Talk to me. Come on, tell me why.

01:24:57.459 --> 01:25:00.495
Well, now you have
nothing to say, huh?

01:25:00.496 --> 01:25:03.187
Talk to me! Say something!

01:25:05.401 --> 01:25:07.534
Then kiss me.

01:25:54.116 --> 01:25:57.216
Kate? Kate.

01:27:03.352 --> 01:27:06.111
Thomas! Thomas!

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:12.104
Good god, Alex. What happened?

01:29:13.549 --> 01:29:15.807
Stevens is dead.

01:29:16.151 --> 01:29:17.818
Vaughn Stevens?

01:29:17.819 --> 01:29:21.618
- Baldwin's dead, too.
- Baldwin? Who is Baldwin?

01:29:21.619 --> 01:29:23.155
What are you talking about?

01:29:23.156 --> 01:29:28.759
There's no political motivation,
no financial motivation.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:34.135
The only motivation I
see is a personal one.

01:29:34.136 --> 01:29:38.328
- Why bring this to me?
- Because I need to know the truth.

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:42.341
Like I told you before.

01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:43.604
You're too close.

01:29:43.605 --> 01:29:44.769
You can't see it.

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:46.972
You have to see it from
the right perspective.

01:29:46.973 --> 01:29:48.446
Right perspective. Perspective.

01:29:48.447 --> 01:29:51.115
Try mine. Perspective.

01:30:03.999 --> 01:30:08.567
If you can't see it, Alex,
then you're still too close.

01:30:09.972 --> 01:30:12.037
Not anymore.

01:30:13.108 --> 01:30:14.968
Good.

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.974
Then you understand.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:24.710
There's nothing you can do.
You have no proof.

01:30:25.387 --> 01:30:28.920
It was always your job
to keep his secret.

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:32.293
I just want the President to be...

01:30:32.294 --> 01:30:34.284
remembered as a good President.

01:30:34.285 --> 01:30:36.961
Still protecting him, huh?

01:30:38.734 --> 01:30:40.992
It's over, Alex.

01:31:27.382 --> 01:31:29.906
- Wow, you clean up real good.
- Why, thank you.

01:31:29.907 --> 01:31:33.619
- You look very handsome yourself.
- Thank you.

01:31:34.556 --> 01:31:38.555
Took the liberty of ordering
us a bottle of wine.

01:31:38.727 --> 01:31:41.019
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:31:41.763 --> 01:31:43.657
No ring.

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:47.566
You know, this isn't a date-date.

01:31:48.904 --> 01:31:53.131
- You think I'd date you?
- Like you'd ever get the chance.

01:31:53.642 --> 01:31:56.644
- Unless.
- Unless?

01:31:56.645 --> 01:32:01.008
Unless you tell me what
really happened with Stevens.

01:32:01.049 --> 01:32:04.877
The whole story.
Because suicide is just too easy.

01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:09.178
Well, with Baldwin still alive, he
could've been tied in to the whole thing.

01:32:09.179 --> 01:32:12.885
It's just a matter of time.
So, he took the easy way out.

01:32:12.886 --> 01:32:16.128
But why do it in the first place?

01:32:16.798 --> 01:32:19.527
I don't know. We're still
looking for a motive.

01:32:19.528 --> 01:32:22.598
And what if you don't find one?

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:27.904
What then, you're just
gonna walk away?

01:32:27.905 --> 01:32:31.769
Far enough to see things
from a different perspective.

01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.839
- That's it?
- Unless you know something I don't.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.143
- Thomas, I don't believe it.
- What?

01:32:36.144 --> 01:32:37.842
After everything that
we've been through...

01:32:37.843 --> 01:32:42.612
after everything that's happened
to us, you're still holding out on me?

01:32:44.426 --> 01:32:48.028
Fine. All right, well,
you know I won't give up.

01:32:48.029 --> 01:32:51.391
I'm not the woman
that just walks away.

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:55.735
Now, I will find out
the truth. I will.

01:32:55.736 --> 01:32:58.664
- To the truth.
- To the truth.
