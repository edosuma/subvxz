- Previously on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

00:05.005 --> 00:05.039
- When you go
to that dark place,

00:05.706 --> 00:05.739
it's f---ing scary as hell.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.109
- Yeah, I know. Tom, you've
already paid me back for that.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.511
You f---ed a girl in Vegas,
you make out with a girl here.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.113
- God.
- I upgraded

00:12.146 --> 00:13.114
Tom and Katie's room.

00:14.048 --> 00:14.648
Hopefully he's not
sleeping on the couch.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.184
[all laugh]

00:17.285 --> 00:18.152
- I'm piecing together
the fact that everything you

00:18.686 --> 00:20.154
and Katie have a fight about,

00:20.188 --> 00:20.921
you fight about the fact

00:21.755 --> 00:21.789
that you f---ed
that chick in Vegas.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.158
- We never had sex.
- Damn it, yes, you did.

00:25.093 --> 00:25.559
Carmen was there
and she saw it, and she's--

00:26.227 --> 00:27.161
- I'm out of here.
- You--

00:28.229 --> 00:28.262
- She brought up the past.
She brought up the past.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.064
- That's a horrible person.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.200
- Everybody f---ing
grows up, Tom.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.535
- Your penis was not capable
of going inside that girl.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.570
Sorry, but it wasn't.

00:39.607 --> 00:44.078
- * You know
that it's our time *

00:44.112 --> 00:46.214
* These are the best days

00:46.247 --> 00:48.682
* Of our lives

00:48.716 --> 00:52.153
* Just raise
your glasses high *

00:52.186 --> 00:56.124
* This one's
for you tonight *

00:57.658 --> 01:00.428
- * Too far gone
to say you're sorry *

01:00.461 --> 01:03.264
* There's a line
and I know you crossed it *

01:03.297 --> 01:05.699
* Is it true
what everyone's saying? *

01:05.733 --> 01:10.204
* Too late, too late

01:10.238 --> 01:12.140
- But we did figure out
that the root is Vegas...

01:12.173 --> 01:13.574
- That's the root.
That's the root of everything.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.708
- Of all of Katie's issues.
- Oh, that's the root?

01:14.742 --> 01:17.178
What about the four years
before that?

01:17.211 --> 01:19.413
- I'm done.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.515
Dude, I'm done with her.
I'm done with Katie.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.452
I'm not marrying her.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.287
I'm not.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.456
I can not marry her.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.458
[tense music]

01:30.491 --> 01:32.326
- You've never talked
to me about this.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.327
- About what?

01:33.361 --> 01:36.464
- Like, whether Schwartz
had sex with somebody.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.132
- Well...

01:38.166 --> 01:40.601
- I had no idea
that's why y'all are fighting.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.203
- A long time ago

01:43.371 --> 01:43.637
when the whole cheating stuff
was going down,

01:44.705 --> 01:45.506
Jax said
that when they were in Vegas,

01:46.207 --> 01:47.107
Tom came back to the hotel room

01:48.041 --> 01:48.709
and said that he had slept
with this girl.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.245
- Please, did you say anything
to Kristen

01:52.246 --> 01:54.148
that anything happened in Vegas?
- Yeah, I did.

01:54.182 --> 01:57.351
- Maybe I am still
harboring resentment

01:57.385 --> 01:58.686
towards my being cheated on.

01:58.719 --> 02:02.256
- That makes so much
f---ing sense--I wish I knew it.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.192
- This was something
that came about, like,

02:04.225 --> 02:07.328
when we were,
like, not friends.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.163
I didn't want to talk
to everyone about it.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.165
I didn't want to make it
public knowledge.

02:11.199 --> 02:14.702
I was trying to protect--
I was trying to protect Tom.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.738
- I'm really sorry.
No, I'm so sorry.

02:17.771 --> 02:21.509
It's really weird to hear Katie
talk about something so extreme

02:21.542 --> 02:23.277
and difficult in her life

02:23.311 --> 02:25.313
and know that
I wasn't there for it

02:25.346 --> 02:27.548
and I didn't know
anything about it.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.183
Like, you think
you're best friends

02:29.217 --> 02:29.717
with somebody and you forget--

02:30.551 --> 02:32.786
oh, we weren't
friends a year ago.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.789
- Oh, he didn't know where
he went or how he got there.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.392
You don't know a God damn thing
that happened...

02:40.994 --> 02:42.796
I'm tired of pretending, like,
I don't know that he f---ed

02:42.830 --> 02:46.434
that girl, like,
so just, like, admit to it.

02:46.467 --> 02:50.438
That would be stupendous.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.772
- Schwartz cheated on Katie.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.241
You think that's the root
of the problem?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.408
- No, that's not what we think.
- No.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.609
- That's what Katie said.
- Said.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.711
- That's what you said to me.
- That's what Katie said.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.248
- She's trying to act like
that's what it's about.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.649
- I'm not saying
she's trying to act like.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.750
Tom, that's not--she was angry.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.452
- But Schwartz, he acted
like she was angry before.

03:05.152 --> 03:05.519
You wouldn't propose to someone

03:06.254 --> 03:07.187
who's just angry
all of the time.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.456
You don't propose to someone--

03:09.590 --> 03:10.190
- He's proposing to somebody
who gave him an ultimatum.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.292
- No, no.
Bullsh--.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.294
- No. No.
- F--- you for saying that, Tom.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.127
Do not say that.
- No, Tom.

03:14.995 --> 03:15.763
- I'm not pulling this
out of thin air.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.332
- Today I'm telling you that--

03:18.366 --> 03:20.234
take that next step with me,

03:20.268 --> 03:23.237
otherwise I need to move on
with my life.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.506
If you can't figure it out,
then it's done.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.575
- Nobody wants to believe it,
but it's true.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.710
I mean, maybe Katie should have
worked all this f---ing sh--

03:29.743 --> 03:32.446
out before she pushed Schwartz
into proposing to her.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.315
- He f---ing loves her.
He does.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.115
Otherwise he would not have

03:35.983 --> 03:36.784
gotten down on one knee
and proposed.

03:37.785 --> 03:38.619
- Don't put your f---ing finger
in my face.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.821
I've had my f---ing finger
in my face all f---ing night!

03:41.722 --> 03:42.456
- She's not.
- I did not in your face.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.658
- What are you mad about?
- I'm sick and tired of him

03:45.693 --> 03:47.595
f---ing just getting f---ing
belittled and told

03:47.628 --> 03:51.365
what he needs to do
all the f---ing time.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.734
Leave him the f--- alone!

03:53.767 --> 03:56.304
He's a f---ing battered wife!

03:56.337 --> 03:57.738
Look at him!

03:59.873 --> 04:01.642
- I'm probably

04:01.675 --> 04:03.877
the dumbest woman on the planet.
- No, no, no, no, no.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.279
- No, you're not.
You're not dumb.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.581
- I'm the dumbest woman
on this f---ing planet.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.749
- No, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.683
- Katie.
- I just understand why

04:09.717 --> 04:11.819
he wouldn't just be,
like, say I'm sorry.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.854
- Oh, God.
- Tom's not the type of person

04:13.887 --> 04:14.888
that would just take something
to the grave.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.524
- Tom's never gonna tell--

04:16.557 --> 04:20.361
- Like, I f---ing protected
his ass way too long.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.729
*

04:29.370 --> 04:32.373
- What if you say, "Listen,
I will marry you, yes.

04:32.406 --> 04:36.844
I will marry you but you first
need to tell me the truth."

04:36.877 --> 04:37.845
That can't happen?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.913
- She gave him an ultimatum.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.349
- She gave him an ultimatum,
but he married her.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.850
- No, she didn't.

04:42.883 --> 04:43.817
It's their shtick.
It's their joke.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.855
- Here's the princess herself.
- Tom, I love you.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.792
- I love you.
- What'd she do to you?

04:53.461 --> 04:56.664
- Yeah, well, you did, so...
- Yeah, and you're also a bitch.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.499
- Wait a second.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.933
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.935
You can't talk like that.
You cannot talk like that.

05:01.969 --> 05:05.873
- Okay.
I wish Katie just cheated on me.

05:05.906 --> 05:09.843
I wish that was my only problem
with that--I wish Katie.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.381
- Schwartz does not act like
this unless Sandoval's around.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.883
- Jax and I--I was taking
Jax's makeup off him,

05:15.916 --> 05:16.917
which I know sounds ridiculous,

05:18.151 --> 05:19.820
and I could hear them
just talking so bad about you,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.389
and I was getting so mad,
'cause I was like,

05:21.422 --> 05:23.457
"Kristen's not here
to defend herself."

05:23.491 --> 05:25.726
- She's gonna get in my face,
I'm gonna talk about old Doute.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.428
How many guys did she f---
while she was dating you?

05:27.461 --> 05:29.697
- A lot.
- This f---ing slut.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.798
- If I can
slit Sandoval's throat

05:30.831 --> 05:32.600
and just get him off the face
of the f---ing Earth

05:32.633 --> 05:33.934
and then Schwartz
won't act like this anymore.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.869
I swear to God,
he never acts like this

05:35.903 --> 05:37.438
unless he's around
f---ing Sandoval.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.972
- I've never been mad
at them before.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.941
- It is weird.
It is f---ing weird.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.376
- Tonight is the first night
I've been mad at them

05:42.410 --> 05:43.444
and I'm, like, very mad.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.712
- It's all Tom's fault.

05:44.745 --> 05:48.549
By Sandoval never even calling
Schwartz out on his wrongdoings,

05:48.582 --> 05:50.851
he's not helping at all.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.953
I think that Tom and Katie
would be much better off

05:52.986 --> 05:54.955
if Sandoval
would maybe create solutions

05:54.988 --> 05:56.890
instead of creating problems.

05:56.924 --> 06:01.462
- I'm so sad that, like,
I didn't know and--

06:01.495 --> 06:05.466
- But that's my fault.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.834
- No, it's not.

06:06.867 --> 06:10.504
- Here's the Cliff Notes:
Tom cheated on me,

06:10.538 --> 06:11.939
lied hardcore.

06:11.972 --> 06:13.907
Then he admitted,

06:13.941 --> 06:17.878
but, you know, like,
just, like, 20% admitted it,

06:17.911 --> 06:19.012
and that was it.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.714
Like, I've already
made up my mind.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.883
I've been with this dude
for so long that this,

06:22.916 --> 06:27.921
like, loose skank bitch
was not going to shake that.

06:27.955 --> 06:31.425
- This is a horrible idea
to have a joint bachelor party.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.027
- Kate said to me, she goes,
"I just want him to admit it."

06:34.061 --> 06:35.429
That's it. That's all.
She goes--

06:36.196 --> 06:38.932
- Admit what?
- Admit to what happened.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.000
- I did it.
I did admit.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.503
- Come on.
Really?

06:42.536 --> 06:44.638
They say when you're drunk,

06:44.672 --> 06:45.906
down there is not really
gonna work,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.941
but I know when I'm drunk
it's this head

06:47.975 --> 06:50.911
that shuts down, not this one.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.946
- Oh, my God. Can I--
- Just say you're sorry, dude,

06:52.980 --> 06:53.847
and this'll all be over.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.916
- Can I get her one time
to say I'm sorry

06:55.949 --> 06:56.917
for f---ing ruining my life?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.552
- Yeah, absolutely.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.021
Maybe she'll do it, too.
But this can help.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.923
This can help if you just say
you're sorry.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.592
If you sat down with her,
just, "Listen,

07:04.625 --> 07:05.793
"baby, I love you so much.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.060
"Let's work this out.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.962
If not, let's call
the f---ing thing off."

07:08.996 --> 07:10.664
- Yeah.
- Because you're miserable.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.032
You're f---ing miserable.

07:12.065 --> 07:12.666
- Yeah.
- We're at a bachelor party.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.535
You've cried three times.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.036
- Yeah.
- This is not normal.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.473
If you said this was normal,
you're out of your mind.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.541
This is not normal.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.709
- Ew.
- Tom, what are you doing?

07:21.742 --> 07:22.843
- It's all water.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.978
- Tom, just say, "Listen,
I'm gonna talk reasonably

07:25.979 --> 07:27.981
"as a fiancé about to get
married in two weeks

07:28.015 --> 07:29.950
and try to come together
and be a team."

07:29.983 --> 07:30.984
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:31.985 --> 07:32.720
- Do you think you're
sober enough, though,

07:33.921 --> 07:34.588
in your head right, now to sit
and talk with her or not?

07:35.288 --> 07:36.757
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

07:39.860 --> 07:42.062
Girls?

07:42.095 --> 07:44.965
Girls, do you mind
if just Tom talks to Katie?

07:44.998 --> 07:45.899
- I don't want to look
like this.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.801
- No. No. No.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.703
No.
It's not happening.

07:49.737 --> 07:50.904
Tom!
- All right, we're gonna go.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.940
- Oh, my God.
Stop.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.709
Tom, you go as well.
I'm not having a conversation.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.110
- Hey, it's okay.
- No.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.980
- Ow, Bubba.
- Oh, God.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.849
I can't take that.
Stop.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.851
- Come on.
- Please let them talk.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.886
Just let Katie and Tom talk.
Brittany, you too.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.120
- You're right.
- All right, we're going.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.121
We're going.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.790
- And I need my d--- sucked.

08:09.823 --> 08:10.991
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.726
- I'm going to smack you
all over.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.961
- I love you so much.
I'll go down on you instead.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.029
- Thank you.
- Now I have to go down

08:16.063 --> 08:17.531
on my girlfriend
because of this.

08:17.565 --> 08:18.999
It's not fun.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.968
- I don't want to talk.
I'm not ready.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.804
- Bubba, I do love you a lot.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.939
- Tom, you have smoky
eye makeup on

08:25.973 --> 08:28.008
and you have one eyebrow
that goes like this.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.042
- Okay.
- I can't.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.613
- My eyeballs--my eyeballs
aren't going like that.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.014
My eyeballs are chill.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.116
- This is just
completely pointless.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.885
Tom is blackout drunk.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.953
He just needs to go to bed

08:39.987 --> 08:44.758
and we can revisit in
the morning when he's sober-ish.

08:44.792 --> 08:45.926
- I wasn't around
during these times.

08:47.094 --> 08:47.127
- You weren't around.
You want to know what happened?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.029
- What happened? Yeah.
I want you to tell me for real.

08:49.997 --> 08:50.664
- Do you want to know
what happened? Okay.

08:51.665 --> 08:51.699
This is what happened.
I'm sorry to tell you,

08:52.666 --> 08:53.801
this is the time Carmen
and I were dating.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.935
- Then we'll go.

08:56.003 --> 08:56.670
- We came back to the room.
We're going to bed.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.806
He came in the room, wasted,

08:58.839 --> 09:01.008
took all his clothes off
in front of Carmen and I.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.010
He was storming around the room,
running around the room.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.078
He's like, "I did something bad.
I did something bad."

09:05.112 --> 09:09.149
And he basically admitted
to hooking up with that girl.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.151
- Like, sex?
- Yeah.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.887
I think that's
how that all started.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.122
- Okay.
- Tell me what I did wrong

09:15.155 --> 09:18.025
and I'll accept it--tell me.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.994
- You've been an asshole
all night, I guess, and--

09:21.028 --> 09:21.895
- Please.
I have to deal with her

09:22.830 --> 09:24.965
going to the f---ing dark side
once a month.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.934
God, I wish Katie
just f---ed a guy.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.702
I wish Katie
just f---ed a guy.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.903
- No, Schwartz.
- And I never f---ed her.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.972
I made out with a chick
'cause I was drunk.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.074
- Tom, Tom.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.076
- Nice dating f---ing life.

09:36.109 --> 09:39.780
- Tom.
- Jax, Frank, Patrick.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.649
Good run, Stassi.

09:41.682 --> 09:43.016
Good run, Stass.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.985
- * Ah-ra-ta-ta

09:45.018 --> 09:48.021
- Seriously?
What is my poor choice in men

09:48.055 --> 09:52.059
have to do with you allegedly
f---ing a girl in Vegas?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.962
I will never let anybody call
you Tequila Katie ever again.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.097
That's just bad argument skills.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.866
Does anyone feel bad for me yet?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.000
- I totally do.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.004
- Were you guys
looking for problems?

10:04.037 --> 10:05.839
- Well...
- The hard work

10:05.873 --> 10:07.775
in a marriage starts later.

- What happened
to my underwear?

10:39.439 --> 10:44.311

10:44.344 --> 10:46.346
Oh, f---.
I don't know what happened.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.180
- We're going to the pool
at 1:00.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.415
We're all meeting down there
at 1:00.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.685
- Well, I'm going to the gym
as soon as I can get in the gym.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.687
*

10:53.721 --> 10:56.757
Oh, there he is.
Sleeping beauty.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.125
- Lost my underwear.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.392
- You still have your sash
on and everything.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.195
- I woke up with
a full morning wood in a dress.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.263
[both laugh]

11:04.297 --> 11:06.266
Swear to God,
I had a big boner this morning.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.840

11:12.873 --> 11:14.074
- Hi.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.476

Dude.

11:16.509 --> 11:20.380
- My God. Those f---ing nails.
- They're grossing me out, dude.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.382
- I know.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.284
- I slept with my contacts in.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.387
- Last night was so much fun
until the end.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.123
I don't want everything
to be Band-Aid better,

11:30.157 --> 11:31.458
but I want things
to be better.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.425
- Yeah.

11:33.426 --> 11:34.728
Tom and Katie never seem
to resolve their issues.

11:35.562 --> 11:36.296
They get in these big
arguments--

11:36.964 --> 11:37.430
usually when they're drunk--

11:38.298 --> 11:39.199
throw temper tantrums
like toddlers

11:40.167 --> 11:41.334
until they get tuckered out
and fall asleep,

11:42.469 --> 11:43.170
and then they just wake up
the next morning

11:44.437 --> 11:45.438
and they forgot what they even
argued about the night before.

11:46.639 --> 11:47.374
- Looks like we're gonna be
spending the whole day together.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.277
- Yeah.
It's gonna be awkward.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.145
- Was that your dinner?
- What?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.346
- All of that?
- No.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.349
I had chicken tenders.

11:56.383 --> 11:59.419
This is just my snacks.

11:59.452 --> 12:00.420
How was last night?

12:00.453 --> 12:02.389
Because I heard yelling.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.857
- I can't imagine

12:03.891 --> 12:09.096
if we were in half as bad
of a place as they're in

12:09.129 --> 12:10.497
weeks leading up to our wedding,
you know, like?

12:10.530 --> 12:12.432
- Yeah.
- Katie and Tom are just, like,

12:12.465 --> 12:14.434
at each other's throats.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.304
Katie drinks, they fight.
Tom drinks, they fight.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.840
Maybe if everyone just stays
sober until the wedding,

12:19.873 --> 12:22.342
this will all run smoothly.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.445
- There's a lot--they have
to just really be honest

12:25.478 --> 12:26.814
with each other.

12:27.881 --> 12:28.348
- They did do a pre-nup,
which obviously is looking

12:29.216 --> 12:30.350
like a great idea at this point.
- Ugh.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.185
- I do think it is smart
of them.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.353
- Yeah.
- For us that was, like,

12:33.386 --> 12:34.487
it was never even
a consideration.

12:35.555 --> 12:36.289
I wouldn't marry someone
I don't completely trust,

empty out my bank account?

12:39.960 --> 12:41.461
Go to Sur and pick up my tips?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.363
Like.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.298
- Maybe.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.370
- When are we leaving?

12:50.403 --> 12:53.373
- 20 minutes. Is that cool?
- Mm-hmm.

12:53.406 --> 12:56.343
- I've known Katie and Schwartz
since before they got together,

12:56.376 --> 12:59.346
and they're still fighting
over some of the same things.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.948
- Don't get upset.
- Tom. Tom! Stop it.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.482
- You're drunk. All right.
I'm out of here.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.417
- Talk to your f---ing
friends.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.419
- Look at her.
She can't control herself.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.454
- Whoo!
- She's drinking.

13:08.455 --> 13:08.922
- Oh, my God, Schwartz.
- I know you can't take

13:09.456 --> 13:09.923
a stand for yourself

13:10.623 --> 13:11.391
because you're a f---ing pussy,

13:12.025 --> 13:12.325
but can you take a stand

13:13.160 --> 13:14.862
for your girlfriend
ever in your life?

13:14.895 --> 13:16.263
- Oh, my God.
- I wasn't there

13:16.296 --> 13:17.464
for the Vegas girl saga,

13:17.497 --> 13:19.166
so I'm trying to figure out
the best way

13:19.199 --> 13:21.902
to support them as a couple,
and it's hard.

- Hi, Lisa.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.389
- You're early.
- I am.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.957
- That's what I like.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.859
- Cut it already.
Come on.

13:45.893 --> 13:48.261
- What is going on out here?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.264
- We have to put this tent
to protect us from the rain.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.299
- So, what's he doing?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.502
- He is about to cut one branch.
- Hey, be careful.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.271
- I think it's not safe
to stay here.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.340
- Don't let him cut
anymore.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.409
- All right, I'll see you later.
- All right.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.911
- Lisa?
- Yes?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.914
- Can I have, like,
a second of your time?

14:06.947 --> 14:08.415
- Yep.
Go ahead.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.550

for a year and a half.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.219

Jeez.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.386
- I know. Hosting.
- Okay.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.889
Well, it's been a pretty
positive experience, I hope.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.624
- It has, and I wanted to see

14:17.657 --> 14:21.361
if maybe you would consider
promoting me to a server.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.896
- You think you know
the menu, right?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.431
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:24.464 --> 14:26.499
Why don't I kind of put you
through your paces?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.435

14:30.337 --> 14:31.404

- My phone is ringing.

14:31.438 --> 14:32.472
Let me just answer my phone.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.407
I think it's very important
for people

14:35.575 --> 14:36.643
to come up through the ranks
in a restaurant.

14:36.676 --> 14:39.446
Just like my own son.
He started as a dishwasher,

then he's a runner,

was a DJ, and now he's fired.

a few little flare-ups.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.466
- Flare-ups?
That doesn't sound good.

14:59.499 --> 15:00.968
- I feel like he was
picking fights

15:01.001 --> 15:02.435
with me more than anything.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.403
You know, I wasn't
really doing anything

15:04.604 --> 15:06.473
that would warrant him
to get mad at me, but.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.408
- I mean, are you guys
looking for problems?

15:08.441 --> 15:09.676
- Well--

15:10.944 --> 15:11.945
- Nothing's that important you
need to be fighting right now.

15:12.612 --> 15:13.246
Trust me on that one.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.016
The hard work
in a marriage starts later.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.617
Tough times are inevitable,

15:17.650 --> 15:20.053
and if Tom and Katie
can't have a good time

15:20.087 --> 15:23.056
on their bachelor party,
when can they?

15:23.090 --> 15:24.457

that you do want to do

15:24.491 --> 15:26.393
a Sur photo shoot this year?

15:26.426 --> 15:28.461

all the things

that you've got to do
when you're back here.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.465
Go patch things up
with Schwartzy.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.333
- We will.
I'll make sure of it.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.634

your relationship

15:34.667 --> 15:36.469
back on the right track.

to lots of those,

[laughs]

16:20.113 --> 16:22.482
- Hey, what's up, man?
How's it going?

16:22.515 --> 16:23.583
- Hey, buddy.
- I'm good.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.152
Dude, I don't even know
what happened.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.386
How did it come to this?

16:27.354 --> 16:28.455
- Where is Katie right now?
- Where's Katie?

16:29.322 --> 16:29.356
- How did she sleep?
- I don't know.

16:30.157 --> 16:30.623
I haven't talked
to her yet today.

16:31.691 --> 16:31.724
- No one's talked to her?
- I asked her to come

16:32.525 --> 16:33.360
to our room,
and she never came.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.362
- Worst-case scenarios
of a joint

16:36.463 --> 16:38.498
bachelor/bachelorette party
nightmare has come true.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.500
I talk a big game,
but I'm actually really scared.

16:40.533 --> 16:41.568
Katie's scary.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.038
- This is a great conversation
for a pool party.

16:45.072 --> 16:48.475
- I feel like my best choice
right now is to just run away.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.478
Just pick up whatever I have
and start fresh.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.383
- You okay?
- I'm falling apart.

16:57.384 --> 17:04.457
*

17:05.458 --> 17:08.461
- Why do we have
to be hungover for this?

17:08.495 --> 17:09.429
- If I have to be hungover
with anyone,

17:09.462 --> 17:11.198
I'm glad it's you guys.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.466
*

17:13.500 --> 17:17.204
- Grandma!
- Hey, sweetie.

17:17.237 --> 17:20.607
both: Oh.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.742
- I see you girls are dressed
for the heat to help us move.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.544
Hey, honey.
- Hi.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.479
- That's so exciting.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.414
- Hi.
- Hey, sweetie-pie.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.749
- My dad is selling
my childhood home.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.618
- This is where you grew up?
- Yeah.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.087
I just really wanted to come
for, like, one last time

17:34.121 --> 17:36.523
and see it before
I can't anymore.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.459
I have so many memories here,
bad and good.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.429
When Hurricane Katrina
came and flooded my house,

17:42.462 --> 17:45.165
or all of the sleepovers with
my best friend, Sheena Menina.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.833
Like, so many sleepovers
to the point

17:46.866 --> 17:48.501
where my dad thought
I was a lesbian.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.737
Oh, my God, Dad, whenever
I would come home from school

17:50.770 --> 17:52.872
but before you got home,
I would, like,

17:52.905 --> 17:55.175
walk around singing
Broadway show tunes.

17:55.208 --> 17:58.211
Like, this was my audience
and then the dogs would howl.

17:58.245 --> 18:02.515
- Well, sing us the show tunes.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.217
I'm gonna really
miss this house.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.452
- Did you all have
a good time yesterday?

18:05.485 --> 18:06.453
- Way too much fun.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.255
I've been puking all morning.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.623
I keep throwing up.
I'm so hungover.

18:10.657 --> 18:11.824
You don't understand.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.093
It's nice to be around
my grandmother right now,

18:15.128 --> 18:15.828
because I see
this wonderful woman

18:16.763 --> 18:19.266
who is now alone
since my grandfather died

18:19.299 --> 18:22.502
having such an exciting life
and loving every day.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.871
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you, too.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.474
She's everything
that I aspire to be.

18:27.507 --> 18:31.778
Half of it I won't be, 'cause
she's way nicer than I am.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.213
It's kind of sad.

18:33.246 --> 18:35.582
- I know, but you know
what I always say.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.686
Once you take everything out
of your home, it's only a house.

18:39.719 --> 18:41.488
- Yeah.
- But of course you've been away

18:41.521 --> 18:43.156
for a while.
- Mm-hmm.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.591
- Remember when you lived
with us.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.526
- Yeah.
- Your mom,

18:46.559 --> 18:49.562
we'd get you dressed up
in cute little dresses.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.164
- And I would change, like,
three times a day.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.565
- Yes.
- Grandma, I always say

18:52.599 --> 18:54.534
that you're where I got
my style from.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.568
- Yeah?
- 'Cause you have the

18:55.602 --> 18:56.303
best style of anyone I know.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.604
- Thank you, dear.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.307
And of course I have
to take credit for your name.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.575
- You named me Stassi?
- Yes.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.312
You know, here's this
little bitty baby, Nastasia.

19:05.345 --> 19:09.649
I said, "Oh, my God.
I'm calling her Stassi."

19:09.682 --> 19:11.751
- I mean, you have, like,
so many grandchildren

19:11.784 --> 19:14.554
and great grandchildren,
but I've always been your fave.

19:14.587 --> 19:18.825
- Right. You have. Yes.
- I love you.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.594
- I love you, too.

19:21.628 --> 19:23.296
- Now, if you feel like
giving me some of your Chanels,

19:23.330 --> 19:24.664
I'd be okay with that.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.599
[both laugh]

19:27.767 --> 19:29.602
- You were a nightmare of
a human being for the first two

19:29.636 --> 19:30.903
or three years I dated you.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.872
- You know what, Tom?
You had an option back then.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.574
And you put a ring
on my f---ing finger,

19:39.912 --> 19:42.649
[upbeat music]

19:44.584 --> 19:45.852
- Do I look defeated?
- No.

19:46.986 --> 19:47.587
- I feel like everyone--
- Well, you had a lot to drink.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.656
But last night, I don't know
if it was the alcohol talking

19:50.890 --> 19:52.559
or what, but you said, "How
the hell can I marry this girl?"

19:52.592 --> 19:53.893
You were saying, like,
"I'm broken.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.695
I don't know what to do
anymore."

19:55.728 --> 19:56.663
- Ugh.
- "I've tried A, B, C, and D.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.565
I don't know what else
to do anymore."

19:59.566 --> 20:00.900
- I know, I think I was being
a little cynical

20:00.933 --> 20:02.669
in that heat of the moment.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.304
Al right,
I'm gonna talk to Katie.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.706
- I don't think you can afford
another blow up.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.608
I think it'll break you.
I think it'll be done.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.676
- Ugh.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.010
- Sometimes in a relationship,

20:11.043 --> 20:12.945
you just got to give in

20:12.979 --> 20:15.982
and just say you're sorry
just so it can stop.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.685
I mean, look at me.
I stopped the whole "rumor"

20:18.718 --> 20:19.686
about Brittany and Kristen.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.621
I am sorry.
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

20:22.389 --> 20:22.889
- But you being like,
"I'm sorry.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.391
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings,"

20:25.425 --> 20:26.726
does not make it seem
like you are actually sorry.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.328
- My life's better.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.330
Schwartz, look who I found
at the bar.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.332
- Got a beer for you.
- Tom number two.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.600
- I got you something.

20:33.633 --> 20:37.570
It's another one
because you are Tom number one.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.671
- Give me that.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.940
- Mine says "straight"
in quotations.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.642
I got one for Cardo
that says "I'm with crazy,"

20:42.675 --> 20:44.611
and it has an arrow.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.613
J's says "ask my wife."

20:46.646 --> 20:48.281
- I feel like every guy
eventually just, like,

20:48.315 --> 20:49.716
"You know what,
It's not worth it.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.950
Wife's always right, man."

20:50.983 --> 20:52.985
Just--they don't want
any trouble.

20:53.019 --> 20:54.654
- That happy wife,
happy life thing.

20:54.687 --> 20:56.356
My dad always says
the same to me all the time.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.358
- Let's go to the pool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[upbeat music]

21:03.530 --> 21:08.368

21:08.401 --> 21:10.503
- I 100% am about to get
in this pool.

21:10.537 --> 21:11.671
This is a nice dress, too.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.005
- You're gonna ruin that dress.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.741
- YOLO.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.343
- [gasps]

21:16.376 --> 21:18.778
- I need at least
20 more hours of sleep.

21:18.811 --> 21:22.582
- Yeah, 'cause the boys/girls
kept us up all night.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.683
- They were so weird.
- They weren't making sense.

21:24.684 --> 21:25.618
- They literally all got roofied
a crazy pill.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.755
- I am not gonna let anybody
say Tequila Katie ever again.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.790
It is Tequila f---ing Tom.
- Yeah.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.325
- Tom was, like,
actively looking.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.762
He's like, "I know there's a
reason to be mad at this person.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.498
"It's in here. Let me find it.
Hold on.

21:38.531 --> 21:42.735
Oh, f---in' Frank.
Boom."

21:42.769 --> 21:44.737
I hate that I'm fighting
with Schwartz right now,

21:44.771 --> 21:46.606
but the silver lining is that

21:46.639 --> 21:50.477
for once people got to see Tom
at his worst.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.679
It's not just Tequila Katie's
fault all the time

21:52.712 --> 21:55.081
and it does feel validating.

21:55.114 --> 21:57.684
How is it that we go on this
joint bachelor/bachelorette,

21:57.717 --> 22:00.453
and normally the girls
would be crying and fighting?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.754
We're partying.
We're getting strippers.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.756
- We're getting along.
- Getting along.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.757
- Honestly, it makes me
feel really happy, though,

22:04.791 --> 22:07.093
because we won.

22:07.126 --> 22:14.066
*

22:15.468 --> 22:16.803
- Hello.
- Hello.

22:16.836 --> 22:19.572
Well, let's go for it.

22:19.606 --> 22:21.040
- Okay, welcome to Sur.
My name's Katie.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.074
I'm gonna be taking care of you.

22:22.975 --> 22:23.743
Would you like to start
with a drink?

22:24.644 --> 22:26.579
- I'd like a cocktail.
What do you suggest?

22:26.613 --> 22:28.581
- Okay, my favorite is
the cucumber martini.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.849
- Ah, cucumber martini?
- Yes.

22:29.882 --> 22:34.086
- No, I kind of see something
a little...

22:34.120 --> 22:36.723
maybe fruitier.

22:36.756 --> 22:40.860
- Fruitier?

22:40.893 --> 22:41.794
Okay.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.797
The Big Pinky is
our best-selling drink here.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.700
It is much more
fruiti--fruitier,

22:47.734 --> 22:49.836
or also the strawberry gimlet

22:49.869 --> 22:52.839
has beaut--really good
strawberry purée,

22:52.872 --> 22:55.842
a sugar rim, and vodka.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.676
Vanderpump Vodka.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.778
- When I'm looking
to hire someone,

22:59.712 --> 23:00.713
I want them
to come in with confidence,

23:01.914 --> 23:04.484
and I know maybe it can be
intimidating just to serve me,

23:04.517 --> 23:07.787
but I think if they get past me,
they'll get past anybody.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.689
Okay, so, do you know
all the cocktails?

23:09.722 --> 23:10.457
- I do.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.759
- Inside out, upside down?
- No.

23:12.792 --> 23:14.861
- You know all the ingredients?
- No.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.863
- A server can ruin
a good meal,

23:16.896 --> 23:19.532
but they can also elevate
a great one.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.902
A server can make or break
a diner's experience.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.772
Do we have the beet salad
on the menu?

23:25.805 --> 23:27.507
- Yeah, it's really,
really, really delicious.

23:27.540 --> 23:28.808
Comes with fresh avocado.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.812
- I don't think the beet salad
comes with avocado.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.781
- It doesn't?

23:34.814 --> 23:35.715
[clicks tongue]

23:36.516 --> 23:36.549
- What about
the special of the day?

23:37.349 --> 23:38.117
We always have specials
of the day.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.154
- The grilled Chilean sea bass
with the lemon...

23:42.188 --> 23:45.792
with the lemon...

23:45.825 --> 23:47.894
Hold on.
No, it's this certain sauce.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.797
- Okay, you got to know this
inside out and upside down.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.831
What I want you to do is go away

23:52.732 --> 23:53.700
and I really want you
to learn this menu.

23:54.366 --> 23:54.701
- Okay.
- You're not ready

23:55.301 --> 23:56.268
to do this now--trust me.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.771
- You're right, yeah.
- Did you say I'm right?

23:58.805 --> 24:00.740
That's a good place to start.
- [laughs]

24:00.773 --> 24:02.809

- You know, you've been, like,

24:30.837 --> 24:31.771
you were being mean
to everyone last night.

- Yeah, 'cause I was pissed off
'cause they were coming at me.

24:34.807 --> 24:34.841
Like, there was, like,
an intervention last night.

if you just would admit

24:38.010 --> 24:38.778
that you did have sex
with that girl.

24:39.846 --> 24:40.647
- I didn't have sex with her.
That's the thing.

24:41.413 --> 24:41.814
- Okay, I know.
So continue lying.

24:42.749 --> 24:43.683
- Okay, I was so sh--faced
there's no way

24:44.383 --> 24:45.151
I could've even got an erection.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.520

- I'm just saying.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.688

24:49.822 --> 24:50.489
Just get out of my face.
- No, Bubba, I don't--no, no.

24:51.457 --> 24:51.758
- You f---ed a girl.
You're gonna lie about it.

24:52.391 --> 24:53.259
You're still gonna marry me.

24:54.193 --> 24:54.761
I'm a horrible f---ing person.
I'm a monster.

24:55.695 --> 24:55.728
- I'm not saying that.
- I don't get it.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.830
I don't get you.
I don't get anything.

24:58.965 --> 24:59.732
- Let's talk, come here.
- I'm not doing this anymore.

25:00.466 --> 25:01.267
- Bubba, let's work through it.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.903
Don't make me drink this
Four Loko, 'cause I will.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.905
[tense music]

25:05.938 --> 25:07.774
Drop the Vegas girl thing.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.809
Drop it.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.878
I f---ed up.
I admit it.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.846
But you were a nightmare
of a human being

25:13.880 --> 25:15.848
for the first two
or three years I dated you.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.884
- You don't get to keep saying,
"Well, you were the nightmare.

25:17.917 --> 25:18.718
You were this."

25:19.518 --> 25:19.786
- No, no, no.
You were really bad.

25:20.820 --> 25:21.654
- You know what, Tom?
You had an option back then.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.823
And you put a ring
on my f---ing finger,

25:23.856 --> 25:24.991
so stop throwing it
in my f---ing face.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.826
- Okay, I know.
- We're getting married,

25:26.859 --> 25:28.294
and when I just feel
like there's a slight,

25:28.327 --> 25:30.797
like, trust thing still then--

25:30.830 --> 25:32.198
- You can trust me.

25:34.801 --> 25:36.836
*

25:36.869 --> 25:38.337
I'm just kidding.
- Just do this later.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.806
- Oh, Bubba, no, no, no.

25:39.839 --> 25:40.807
We're doing it now,
'cause I want to--

25:41.674 --> 25:42.208
- No, we're not gonna
get anywhere, Tom.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.777
We're gonna agree on this.
We're never gonna agree.

25:44.811 --> 25:45.812
- This is the bottom line.
Okay, but--okay.

25:45.845 --> 25:46.679
We'll agree to disagree.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.914
All right,
this is what we're gonna do.

25:47.947 --> 25:48.715
We're gonna take
a shot of vodka.

25:49.548 --> 25:49.849
- I'm not taking
a shot of vodka, Tom.

25:50.717 --> 25:51.918
- Oh, God, it's awful, oh, God.
- No.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.921
What you're going to do is
stop criticizing me,

25:54.954 --> 25:56.923
that way I don't need to be
defensive over things.

25:56.956 --> 25:59.058
- Okay.
- I don't need you to remind me

25:59.091 --> 26:00.359
every sh---y thing I've done.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.861
I have a pretty good memory.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.063
- And me neither.
I know I f---ed up, too.

26:04.096 --> 26:06.599
Stop bringing up Vegas.

26:06.633 --> 26:10.069
- Whatever, fine.
- Bubby, I want to be happy.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.905
I want to have a good time today
and have fun.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.775
- So do I.
- Let's do it.

26:15.808 --> 26:16.943
Bubba, here's what's
gonna happen.

26:18.144 --> 26:19.812
We're gonna have a good time,
'cause I f---ing love you,

26:19.846 --> 26:20.813
and we're gonna be cool
with each other.

26:20.847 --> 26:23.683
- It's--okay.

26:23.716 --> 26:24.817
- Let's go have fun.

26:24.851 --> 26:27.954
- You still have makeup on.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.857
- I'm just a man trying
to live.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.259
- Like a woman?
- [laughs]

26:35.294 --> 26:37.830
[overlapping shouts and cheers]

26:37.864 --> 26:39.966
- Whoo!

26:46.172 --> 26:48.207
- * Dance, dance
all night long *

26:49.208 --> 26:49.241
* Let go
when the beat come on *

26:50.009 --> 26:51.177
* Oh wait that's my song

26:51.944 --> 26:55.147
* We are, we are, we are

26:55.181 --> 26:58.918
* When I just want
to get away *

26:58.951 --> 27:01.120
- You keep hitting me
in the face that cord.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.156
- Okay, we all have
to work together here.

27:04.190 --> 27:07.226
- Bubba, you're a Dragzilla.
- No, I'm not.

27:07.259 --> 27:09.295
- Yah-huh.
- That's you.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.364
Unfortunately, things
got messy and fractured,

27:12.398 --> 27:14.967
but it's our last night,
and I want to salvage it.

27:15.001 --> 27:19.071
I want to have one
happy-go-lucky, fun last night.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.372
The back room.
To the back room, let's roll.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.241
- Uh-oh, VIP.

27:22.274 --> 27:24.944
- The party's here!

27:24.977 --> 27:27.213
- Thank you so much.
- What is this, by the way?

27:27.246 --> 27:30.216
- It's called F--- You.
- All right, F--- You.

27:30.249 --> 27:34.420
- F you, sir...Peter.
- This is Tom, that's Peter.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.255
- I feel like I'm at
the Last f---ing Supper.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.223
- Oh, my God.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.225
- You are at
the Last f---ing Supper.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.194
- Yes, what is that, by the way?
That's awful.

27:42.228 --> 27:44.363
- Jameson. It's so wrong,
but it's so right.

27:44.396 --> 27:46.132
- I'm not mad at it now,

27:46.165 --> 27:49.435
'cause, like, having long nails,
I'm not mad at it now.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.370
- He likes it.
- These are f---ing

27:51.403 --> 27:53.239
Swarovski crystals.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.273
- Happy drunk's the best drunk.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.374
There's no other way
to be drunk.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.043
- I'm not Tom Tequila.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.211
Or Tequila Tom.

27:59.245 --> 28:01.147
Heavy drinking is
usually what tears us apart.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.348
- All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.215
I want to show you the Gas Mask.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.252
This does involve
a lot of flames.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.287
- But also, heavy drinking--
it's the glue

28:08.320 --> 28:10.289
that brings us back together.

28:10.322 --> 28:14.460
- This shot is to thinking
positive and testing negative.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.228
All right, we're gonna
take the shot with our straw,

28:16.262 --> 28:17.997
if you don't mind bending over.
- Yes.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.331
- I love when Brittany
bends over.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.200
- Chartreuse is 55% alcohol.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.937
The stuff floating on top
of that was 160-proof alcohol.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.338
- Whoo!
- It's a cycle.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.274
A vicious cycle at times.

28:28.307 --> 28:32.011
- Hey, you ready?
- Oh, my God, no, you're not.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.746
- One more time.
- No.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.215
- These people are crazy
about kissing each other.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.218
[all speaking at once]

28:39.251 --> 28:41.954
- Ew. Ew. Ew
- Ooh, that's hot.

28:41.988 --> 28:44.290
- Send it to the boys.
- I think it's weird as f---,

28:44.323 --> 28:46.993
and right now
I'm just happy I'm married.

28:47.026 --> 28:48.260
- I'm never gonna be able
to make out with anybody else.

28:48.294 --> 28:50.029
Not that that's a big deal.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.164
I actually don't want
to make out with anybody else.

28:52.198 --> 28:54.266
But maybe one time.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.035
- Oh.
- So fancy.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.304
- Each person has one spin.
- Spin that f---ing bottle

28:58.337 --> 28:59.772
if you're gonna do it.

28:59.806 --> 29:03.209
*

29:03.242 --> 29:06.045
all: Oh!

29:06.078 --> 29:07.313
- Oh, my God!

29:07.346 --> 29:10.216
[all shouting at once]

29:10.249 --> 29:14.120
- Shut the f--- up.
- Oh, my God.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.287
- Game over.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.156
- Game over.
- Game f---ing over.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.157
- This is the last time

29:19.125 --> 29:20.793
I'm gonna kiss someone else
as a single man.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.195
No tongue.
- No tongue.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.197
- My last kiss is
gonna be Tom Sandoval.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.033
- Just f---ing come on.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.335
- Oh!
- Yeah!

29:29.368 --> 29:31.103
- Tom!

29:31.137 --> 29:32.471
- Dude, slow down!

29:32.504 --> 29:34.206
- That was too long!

29:34.240 --> 29:35.207
- Sandoval and Schwartz are

29:35.241 --> 29:36.208
secretly in love
with each other.

29:36.242 --> 29:38.210
Not so secretly.

29:38.244 --> 29:39.812
They're openly
in love with each other.

29:39.846 --> 29:43.215
- Stassi, oh, Stassi.
- Seriously?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.516
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.153
- This is so annoying.
- It's landing on Jax.

29:47.186 --> 29:50.356
A million percent.
- Peter!

29:50.389 --> 29:53.225
- Peter, come here.
- All right.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.493
- Oh!
- Kissing Stassi again

29:54.526 --> 29:56.362
was weird.

29:56.395 --> 30:00.232
Back in 2010, we dated
for about four or five months.

30:00.266 --> 30:03.102
I became overbearing.
She became very controlling.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.270
It was like oil and water.

30:05.371 --> 30:07.206
You shake it up a little bit
and maybe it looks good,

30:07.239 --> 30:09.341
but then all of a sudden
it breaks apart.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.277
all: Oh!

30:11.310 --> 30:13.212
- Okay, all right.
Mwah.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.246
- Mwah!

30:14.280 --> 30:16.048
- Aah!

30:16.082 --> 30:19.351
- Not again.
Not again.

30:19.385 --> 30:22.388
- Wow.
That's so weird.

30:22.421 --> 30:23.856
- See this?

30:23.890 --> 30:26.258
This is what the bachelor party

30:26.292 --> 30:28.060
was supposed to be like
from the very beginning.

30:28.094 --> 30:30.062
This is it.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.430
- Your turn.
- Your turn.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.300
all: Do it. Do it. Do it.
- Do what?

30:34.333 --> 30:37.269
- Now we have to do it because
you can't not when they're--

30:37.303 --> 30:39.538
- Do it!
Do it!

30:39.571 --> 30:41.273
- Peter, don't act
like you don't want to.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.274
That's so mean.
- Oh, come on.

30:42.308 --> 30:45.244
- All right.
all: Yeah! Whoo!

30:45.277 --> 30:48.214
[all screaming]

30:48.247 --> 30:50.349
- Honestly, it's frustrating
that everyone

30:50.382 --> 30:51.884
keeps making me kiss Peter,

30:51.918 --> 30:55.187
but I'd rather kiss Peter
than anyone else.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.256
Meaning anybody else
in that bar.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.158
You know what I mean.
[laughs]

30:59.191 --> 31:00.326
[all screaming]
- Okay, all right, all right.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
That's enough.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.862
Yeah, European.

31:05.431 --> 31:09.268
[tense music]

31:09.301 --> 31:11.670
- Oh, my God. Dude.
- Oh. What?

31:11.703 --> 31:14.173
- I'm toweling off, man.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.308
[sighs]
What's going on?

31:16.342 --> 31:17.043
Do you have a lighter?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.345
- Your weave is showing.
- No.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.447
It's not a weave.
They're extensions.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.583
- It's the same thing.
- [sighs]

31:24.616 --> 31:26.252
- You're a giant asshole
tonight.

31:26.285 --> 31:27.686
You're a giant asshole
all the time, honestly.

31:27.719 --> 31:28.820
I'm just being honest with you.
I don't mean to be mean.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.457
I don't mean it in a mean way,
but it comes off that way.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.225
You're kind of a giant asshole.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.460
There's so many million
more things

31:34.493 --> 31:36.295
that I want to bitch about.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.331
Why do you feel the need to talk
to my boyfriend about our past?

31:39.365 --> 31:41.333
What, you think I'm not
pissed off about yesterday?

31:41.367 --> 31:42.334
Are you, like--

31:43.535 --> 31:44.536
- I just came out here to
f---ing smoke a cigarette, dude.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.473
- Well, too bad.
You just stepped into the swamp.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.543
- It's raw and real,
you know what I mean?

31:51.577 --> 31:54.513
- It tells a story.
- Yeah, it does tell a story.

32:02.688 --> 32:05.591
- I just came out here to
f---ing smoke a cigarette, dude.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.694
- Well, too bad.
You just stepped into the swamp.

32:08.727 --> 32:11.663
Why would you even bring up
our dating life

32:11.697 --> 32:13.299
to my current boyfriend?

32:13.332 --> 32:14.700
- You have any idea
of the f---ing sh--

32:14.733 --> 32:16.302
that Kristen's capable of?

32:16.335 --> 32:17.703
- I'll tell you.
- But listen--

32:17.736 --> 32:19.738
- It'll blow your mind, Carter.
- Why the f---

32:19.771 --> 32:21.740
would you go to him, and, like,
talk sh--

32:21.773 --> 32:23.675
about things about me
years and years ago?

32:23.709 --> 32:25.144
Who cares?

32:25.177 --> 32:27.013
He knows everything.
So you say,

32:27.046 --> 32:28.614
"Do you know how many guys
she's f---ed?

32:28.647 --> 32:29.581
Do you know how many
she's f---ed behind my back?"

32:29.615 --> 32:31.217
He knows more than you do.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.719
I don't deny the fact
that I cheated on you.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.624
I cheated on you, I did.
- Two in one weekend.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.727
- What is your end goal
with that?

32:41.760 --> 32:44.596
- First of all,
I didn't go up to Carter.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.298
You guys were
bombarding Schwartz.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.634
That's why all of this bullsh--
was said.

32:48.667 --> 32:51.203
Carter comes into situations

32:51.237 --> 32:55.607
and he talks about things
like he was there.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.642
- She wants you
to have her back.

32:57.543 --> 32:57.576
She feels like you
never have her back.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.111
- I do.
- Either you did

33:00.146 --> 33:00.579
or you did have sex
with that girl, I guess--

33:01.647 --> 33:02.114
- That's neither here nor there.
- I swear to God.

33:03.049 --> 33:05.117
- I was actually there.
- Leave him alone.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.619
- I don't want--
- Stop trying to ruin it.

33:07.653 --> 33:08.720
Actually, you can't
ruin it for me.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.057
- Kristen, listen--
- I'm a different person.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.360
- I'm glad to see you more happy
and I don't want you to--

33:14.393 --> 33:16.595
I don't want
to talk about the past,

33:16.628 --> 33:19.298
and I apologize
if I brought up sh--

33:19.331 --> 33:20.432
that I shouldn't have.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.369
I just want us to be cool.
I want us to f---ing chill.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.636
- Then be cool then.
Don't be cool one day

33:24.670 --> 33:25.671
and then be a dick the next.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.639
- Okay, I will, I will,
I will, I will, fine.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.241
The last time me and Kristen
had a conversation

33:29.275 --> 33:30.742
like this was in Miami.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.712
- It breaks my heart, like,
I cannot listen.

33:33.745 --> 33:34.746
- Kristen, just, please.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.183
Like, I just want you
to be happy.

33:37.216 --> 33:38.584
This sh-- is
all in the past for me.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.686
Like, that book is closed.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.121
I'm gonna give you a hug.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.190
Let's f---ing,
dude, look, come on.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.592
Come on, come on.
We're cool, we're cool.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.794
Kristen, man, I'm sorry, dude.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.196
- Ugh!

33:51.197 --> 33:58.204
*

34:06.778 --> 34:08.780
- Hi, darling.
- I can't believe

34:08.814 --> 34:10.282
you're still working.

34:10.316 --> 34:12.684
God, don't you ever stop?
Move over, move over.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.687
- Just sit down nicely.
Sit down.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.756
Thank you for my tea.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.758
You give me everything I need.

34:19.791 --> 34:21.627
- Exactly.
- Actually,

34:21.660 --> 34:23.795
you're probably the only one
that would put up with me.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.132
Who else would put up
with somebody with eight dogs?

34:26.165 --> 34:28.734
- They're my dogs.
- They're my dogs.

34:28.767 --> 34:32.271
- Right, you're all settled.
Biscuit's gone.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.206
So, what are you doing?
Work?

34:34.240 --> 34:36.408
- Yeah.
I was thinking.

34:36.442 --> 34:39.245
You know the premises
just along from Pump?

34:39.278 --> 34:40.612
- The one you didn't
want me to buy?

34:41.713 --> 34:44.683
- There are things in the window
that make my eyes water.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.718
Oh, my God.

34:46.752 --> 34:52.124
What about maybe if we did
a new kind of young restaurant,

34:52.158 --> 34:56.462
and maybe we had a couple
of young partners?

34:56.495 --> 34:58.430
Pump has only been open
a couple of years,

34:58.464 --> 35:00.232
but already I feel the need

35:00.266 --> 35:03.769
maybe to explore the possibility
of another restaurant.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.805
Maybe we groom somebody
to kind of take

35:06.838 --> 35:08.740
the pressure off us a bit.

35:08.774 --> 35:12.211
I mean, Tom Sandoval
has worked for us,

35:12.244 --> 35:14.713
I mean, for years now.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.149
- He must have been with us
for eight years.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.785
- It may sound crazy,
but what about maybe Sandoval?

35:19.818 --> 35:21.187
He might be ready to take on.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.289
With guidance, maybe.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.923
The thing is
about Tom Sandoval is,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.893
not only he is
an excellent bartender.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.362
I really do feel
that he's hungry.

35:30.396 --> 35:34.500
Maybe to have him as a junior
partner might be a good idea.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.235
Well, it's something
to think about, anyway.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.270
- It certainly is.
- Baby, why don't you pour me

35:38.304 --> 35:39.371
a glass of wine?

35:39.405 --> 35:41.240
I've finished this now.
And then--

35:41.273 --> 35:43.509
- A nice early night,
glass of wine.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.512
- Oh, you calm down.
- A little bit of TV.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.881
Got a particular program
I want to watch tonight.

35:49.915 --> 35:52.484
- Shut up, you.
Come on.

35:52.518 --> 35:56.288
Don't get excited.
You need to calm down.

35:56.322 --> 35:59.391
*

35:59.425 --> 36:01.427
- You want a lap dance?

36:01.460 --> 36:03.829
*

36:03.862 --> 36:06.298
- Strip it off!
Lap dance for Katie!

36:06.332 --> 36:08.834
- Show me again.
- I love this, oh, my God.

36:08.867 --> 36:09.701
- They're definitely
f---ing tonight.

36:10.436 --> 36:11.737
- Yes.
Oh, they need to so bad.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.539
- They're f---ing tonight.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.474
- His pants!
- Dude!

36:15.507 --> 36:18.344
- We peer-pressured Stassi
and Peter into making out,

36:18.377 --> 36:20.779
so maybe we need to
peer pressure Schwartz

36:20.812 --> 36:22.848
and Katie into doing it,

36:22.881 --> 36:24.049
working out their problems.

36:24.082 --> 36:27.519
Get your f---ing ass on there
and give her a lap dance.

36:27.553 --> 36:29.955
- Lap dance!
- Dance!

36:29.988 --> 36:31.523
- Strip it off for Katie.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.292
- Get in there, dude.
Get in there.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.526
Crawl the body.
Crawl.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.561
- Get it.
Oh, yeah.

36:35.594 --> 36:38.264
all: Oh!

36:38.297 --> 36:41.267
[all cheering]

36:41.300 --> 36:42.501
[all laughing]

36:42.534 --> 36:44.503
- Bubba love.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.905
[all laughing]

36:46.938 --> 36:48.540
- Who's got ones?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.576
- Oh!

36:50.609 --> 36:51.977
- You guys want it?
You want it?

36:52.010 --> 36:54.980
You want the funk?
- Ohh!

36:55.013 --> 36:56.982
- You don't want this.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.284
Wow, where is my penis?

36:58.317 --> 36:59.351
- Oh, my God.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.287
I literally have to pay you
to have sex with me,

37:01.320 --> 37:02.554
so it's like the same thing.

37:04.022 --> 37:04.890
- Tom's actually doing a really
good job of a strip tease.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.493
I mean, Tom might actually
get laid tonight, you know?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.995
If Katie doesn't f--- him,
I think Sandoval will.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.998
[dance music]

37:13.031 --> 37:18.570
*

37:18.604 --> 37:21.807
- Are you a backup dancer, Jax?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.608
- Bubba, come here.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.976
Aah!

37:25.010 --> 37:26.612
- Katie and Tom's
relationship is like

37:26.645 --> 37:27.513
being on a rollercoaster.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.416
I mean, they have
crazy highs like tonight,

37:31.683 --> 37:33.985
but eventually gravity's gonna
bring them back down to Earth,

37:34.019 --> 37:36.588
and I just hope when it does
they don't come crashing down.

37:36.622 --> 37:43.562
*

37:52.504 --> 37:53.639
[cork pops]

37:53.672 --> 37:54.606
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

37:55.707 --> 37:59.611
- Guys, I had the most f---ing
awkward conversation

37:59.645 --> 38:01.480
with Kristen.
- When?

38:01.513 --> 38:03.615
- Tonight.
There was a point where I felt

38:03.649 --> 38:08.920
like she was literally having
an argument with herself.

38:08.954 --> 38:11.590
I felt like I was, like,
on a horse that's just, like,

38:11.623 --> 38:13.659
bucking, like, and just, like,

38:13.692 --> 38:15.527
roaming off and, like,
I'm just, like,

38:15.561 --> 38:16.662
trying to f---ing hang on.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.897
- Tom, lay down.
- No, I'm chilling, man.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.599
I'm chilling.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.833
- I'll give you a head rub.
I'll give you a head rub.

38:22.834 --> 38:22.868
- I don't want
any attention anymore, Bubba.

38:23.702 --> 38:24.603
- We've aired
a lot of grievances.

38:25.704 --> 38:28.674
We've fought enough that
we just need to bottle it up

38:28.707 --> 38:31.477
and we can open that bottle
after the wedding.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.611
- It's raw and real,
you know what I mean?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.581
- It tells a story.
- Yeah, it does tell a story.

38:35.614 --> 38:39.485
Of two penises
in his f---ing eyeballs.

38:41.620 --> 38:43.589
- Seeking a little revenge
all over his face

38:43.622 --> 38:46.992
for being such an asshole to me
is really nice.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.361
This is my best masterpiece
ever.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.562
- So pretty.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.601
- What's on your face?
- Chicken cutlets things

38:55.634 --> 38:57.636
that you guys put
in your "hangover kit."

38:57.669 --> 38:58.904
- No, they're not
chicken cutlet things.

39:07.479 --> 39:12.918
- * Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh

39:13.619 --> 39:18.824
* Ahh-ahh-ahh-ahh

39:18.857 --> 39:19.925
- I do not feel good.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.595
- Yeah.
- I feel like death.

39:23.629 --> 39:24.663
What's on your face?

39:25.597 --> 39:26.031
- Chicken cutlets things
that you guys put

39:26.632 --> 39:27.499
in your "hangover kit."

39:28.366 --> 39:28.967
- No, they're not
chicken cutlet things.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.670
That's what you had in your bra
when you were dressed in drag.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.972
- I'm trying to rejuvenate.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.907
- I don't even have room
for this sh--.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.976
- You have one bag
that's all drag stuff.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.978
You should have enough room.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.648
- I know, but I have
acquired more drag sh--.

39:42.681 --> 39:44.983
- I don't think
that's physically possible.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.051
- Please do me a favor

39:47.185 --> 39:49.621
and don't post any pictures
of you in drag on Instagram.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.690
- I'm not, you think I want
to post any of those pictures?

39:51.723 --> 39:52.891
- I'm not even gonna send
a picture of my mom to it

39:52.924 --> 39:55.561
because she was already worried
that you were kissing dudes.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.996
- I think out of this group
I am the least have an issue

39:58.029 --> 39:59.731
with kissing guys.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.000
- Hey, Ariana, you totally
can use this bra, right?

40:02.033 --> 40:04.002
- Yeah, that's my size.

40:04.035 --> 40:06.638
- I feel like yesterday
really helped the trip.

40:06.672 --> 40:08.974
- Yeah.
- The thing is is, the reason

40:09.007 --> 40:10.942
why everyone fights
so much too is

40:10.976 --> 40:12.744
that you can't fight
when you're drunk,

40:12.778 --> 40:15.714
and I know that and I can say
that because I watch everyone.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.948
- Yeah.
- And Schwartz just has a lot

40:16.982 --> 40:20.018
of built-up frustration,

40:20.051 --> 40:23.955
and also they don't listen,
which I can agree with because--

40:23.989 --> 40:28.093
- Give me the steamer and the
other heels over there, please.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.728
- What other heels?

40:29.761 --> 40:31.096
- They're just right there
by my little bag.

40:31.129 --> 40:32.998
- That's what I just said.
Marriage, I feel like

40:33.031 --> 40:33.932
you have to really want to.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.034
Like, for me,
adjusting was wearing a ring.

40:36.067 --> 40:36.902
I don't wear jewelry.

40:37.636 --> 40:38.036
- Mm-hmm.
- Adjustment--

40:38.570 --> 40:39.538
joint bank accounts,

40:40.506 --> 40:41.973
having access to everything
and anything.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.942
- Can you throw that
in my suitcase, please?

40:45.544 --> 40:49.114
[upbeat music]

40:49.147 --> 40:52.017
- I came to New Orleans,
and I kissed a guy.

40:52.050 --> 40:55.053
Granted, that guy was Peter,
one of my ex-boyfriends,

40:55.086 --> 40:57.122
but it was a guy
that wasn't Patrick,

40:57.155 --> 40:58.657
and that made me feel good.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.659
So, I mean, like,
that's progress, right?

41:00.692 --> 41:01.960
*

41:02.994 --> 41:05.163
*

41:05.196 --> 41:06.965
- I think I died last night.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.667
- Oh, Bubba, your poor face.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.035
I'm sorry.
[laughs]

41:10.068 --> 41:12.904
- I scrubbed it so much
I started bleeding.

41:12.938 --> 41:13.939
- It'll come off.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.708
- [laughs]

41:16.742 --> 41:18.977
Dude, how the f---
did that happen?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.111
Just around my lip.

41:20.145 --> 41:22.748
[laughter]

41:22.781 --> 41:24.683
- He's been skullf---ed.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.117
- We pulled it together.
- I know.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.185
- I wish we wouldn't
have fought.

41:27.218 --> 41:30.188
No more fighting.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.190
We'll bottle that sh-- up,
all right?

41:32.223 --> 41:34.660
We're just not gonna fight.

41:34.693 --> 41:35.994
- Yeah.
- We have a wedding

41:36.027 --> 41:38.664
in, like, two weeks,
and any lingering issues

41:38.697 --> 41:42.067
or resentment that Katie
and I haven't fully resolved,

41:42.100 --> 41:43.769
we don't have time
for that stuff.

41:43.802 --> 41:46.071
We're just gonna
set that bottle out to sea.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.038
It was such a beautiful night.

41:47.906 --> 41:49.741
No one fought at all.
People made out.

41:49.775 --> 41:50.909
That's how every night
should be.

41:50.942 --> 41:54.212
- * We gonna make it
we gonna make it *

41:54.245 --> 41:58.850
- I've really tried to move past
this whole Vegas girl thing.

41:58.884 --> 42:01.086
I don't have time
to think about it anymore.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.990
I want to focus on my flowers
and my dress,

42:05.023 --> 42:07.058
and I just want
to put this wedding train

42:07.092 --> 42:08.994
back on the tracks
and get married.

42:09.027 --> 42:10.962
- Sorry I didn't do you
last night.

42:10.996 --> 42:13.031

Okay, so,
is everybody looking good?

42:20.238 --> 42:22.908
- That's great.
- Ew.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.743
- I feel left out
of certain things.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.011
- I didn't know that you wanted
to be included.

42:26.044 --> 42:28.113
- I don't know.
I guess I just miss, like, us.

42:28.146 --> 42:30.916
- Am I really going on OkCupid?

42:30.949 --> 42:32.050
What do you do?

42:33.184 --> 42:35.987
- I work to automate solutions
through technologies.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.990
- These lovers bestow a request

42:39.024 --> 42:42.994
to ordain
their forthcoming nuptial.

42:43.028 --> 42:46.131
- I'm concerned of taking
the responsibility.

42:46.164 --> 42:49.701
I just need to know that you're
really committed to each other.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.971
- I'm just disappointed
in myself and us.

42:54.005 --> 42:55.273
- To see more of
