01:01.660 --> 01:04.530
Sire, forgive me for this, but

01:04.650 --> 01:06.955
I know no other way.

01:07.330 --> 01:09.290
Your empire needs you.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.640
He fought us here,

01:22.720 --> 01:25.480
his generals were here, and
he stole the comet here.

01:25.560 --> 01:28.060
So, Lotor could be anywhere.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.986
We'll never be able to find him
unless we can figure out his plan.

01:31.106 --> 01:32.901
We're totally missing the big picture.

01:33.021 --> 01:34.543
How about this question?

01:34.663 --> 01:36.146
Why was Voltron made out of

01:36.266 --> 01:38.110
the same material as that comet?

01:38.200 --> 01:40.410
What's so special about it?

01:40.698 --> 01:42.518
My father discovered another comet

01:42.638 --> 01:44.450
like that before I was born.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.739
Your father...

01:46.002 --> 01:47.380
And Zarkon.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.005
This is back when Zarkon

01:49.125 --> 01:51.226
- was the Black Lion's paladin?
- Before that.

01:51.346 --> 01:53.500
Before Alfor built the lions.

01:53.620 --> 01:55.423
I know this is painful to talk about,

01:55.543 --> 01:57.630
but if we're going to stop Lotor,

01:57.720 --> 01:59.800
it's time we heard the
rest of the story.

02:01.323 --> 02:03.048
In the beginning, the paladins

02:03.168 --> 02:05.100
were just five leaders,

02:05.180 --> 02:08.139
who despite coming from cultures
which were vastly divergent

02:08.229 --> 02:10.979
and in some cases, had been
warring for generations...

02:11.435 --> 02:13.400
managed to look past their differences

02:13.480 --> 02:16.240
in an effort to protect
their common interests.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.455
What was initially a formal agreement

02:18.575 --> 02:20.220
to work alongside each other

02:20.310 --> 02:22.730
soon blossomed into a true friendship.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.770
A warrior's bond was forged,

02:24.850 --> 02:26.327
and together, they worked

02:26.447 --> 02:29.111
to rid their system of
those who would do it harm.

02:50.130 --> 02:51.130
Oh, dear.

03:03.932 --> 03:04.980
Huh?

03:15.400 --> 03:16.999
I keep warning you not to break

03:17.119 --> 03:19.110
formation and run ahead, Alfor.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.942
You are much more knowledgeable

03:21.062 --> 03:23.080
as an alchemist than a soldier.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.580
That's what I keep you
around for, Zarkon.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.601
The original paladins were

03:35.721 --> 03:37.420
Zarkon from Planet Daibazaal,

03:37.510 --> 03:39.680
King Alfor from Altea,

03:39.760 --> 03:41.600
Gyrgan from Rygnirath,

03:41.680 --> 03:43.930
Trigel of the Dalterion Belt

03:44.010 --> 03:46.060
and Blaytz from Nalquod.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.640
Mm. Pull up a bench and join the feast!

03:50.009 --> 03:51.635
You know that fraternizing with the

03:51.755 --> 03:53.360
servant class is not permitted.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.070
It erodes discipline.

03:55.150 --> 03:58.650
Well, perhaps a bit of discipline
erosion would do you good, Zarkon.

03:58.740 --> 04:01.240
Something I will consider the
next time you are surrounded

04:01.320 --> 04:02.830
by Lambonite scavengers.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.950
I was handling myself.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.200
You mean wetting yourself?

04:10.323 --> 04:12.244
Why I ever joined up with this band

04:12.364 --> 04:14.130
of scoundrels, I'll never know.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.729
Because we're the only band of

04:15.849 --> 04:17.720
scoundrels that would have you.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.130
To us!

04:20.470 --> 04:22.300
By Willow!

04:31.690 --> 04:34.230
They could have never k
nown that, that very night,

04:34.320 --> 04:37.320
the fate of the universe
would be changed forever.

04:41.004 --> 04:43.166
I have finished evacuating all Galra

04:43.286 --> 04:44.710
citizens near the crater.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.659
- What have you discovered?
- We're not sure.

04:47.779 --> 04:50.267
This comet is like none seen before.

04:50.387 --> 04:52.225
It seems to be made of a material

04:52.345 --> 04:54.692
- that can pass between realities.
- What do you mean?

04:54.812 --> 04:57.563
Well, I mean that sages
have always theorized

04:57.683 --> 05:00.464
that there are many realities stacked
side by side with each other.

05:00.584 --> 05:01.970
Whole other universes

05:02.050 --> 05:04.350
with their own histories
unbeknownst to us.

05:04.430 --> 05:06.510
But we never had any proof.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.640
Until now.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.230
When we moved the comet, we found this.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.650
This... is another reality?

05:16.230 --> 05:18.940
What is that?

05:19.060 --> 05:22.217
Do not worry. It is only Kova.

05:22.337 --> 05:24.780
He is from our reality.

05:24.900 --> 05:27.089
Zarkon, this is Honerva.

05:27.209 --> 05:29.690
She is the best alchemist on Altea.

05:29.810 --> 05:31.700
I asked her to come to Daibazaal and

05:31.820 --> 05:33.500
lead the scientific investigation.

05:33.580 --> 05:35.170
Her expertise will be invaluable.

05:35.250 --> 05:37.000
Isn't it exciting?

05:37.090 --> 05:40.590
It could change the way we
understand our entire universe.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.130
Well, find out everything you can.

05:44.220 --> 05:46.640
I will provide any support you require.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.720
I must go.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.230
He didn't stay long.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.541
King Alfor experimented with

05:53.661 --> 05:56.020
the comet's ore in his lab on Altea,

05:56.245 --> 05:57.896
as Honerva continued her research

05:58.016 --> 06:00.070
of the rift on Daibazaal.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.950
But Alfor visited often
as the years passed.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.410
Zarkon, I'd like you to
meet Princess Allura.

06:06.979 --> 06:08.652
It is my pleasure.

06:08.772 --> 06:12.160
Please accept this gift in
honor of your birth, Princess.

06:18.109 --> 06:20.239
Honerva has really softened
you up, my friend.

06:20.359 --> 06:22.164
I never thought I'd
see the day the great

06:22.284 --> 06:24.090
warrior Emperor Zarkon was married,

06:24.170 --> 06:26.800
to an Altean alchemist, no less.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.970
Honerva, working hard as always.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.430
Many thanks for the gift.
Allura loves it.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.020
It was a customary gesture.

06:35.100 --> 06:36.372
Of course.

06:36.492 --> 06:38.414
How is our quintessence experiment?

06:38.534 --> 06:39.940
Still running.

06:40.020 --> 06:42.990
Running for a full year on
one drop of quintessence,

06:43.070 --> 06:45.530
with no decline in
revolutions per dobosh.

06:45.610 --> 06:48.490
No other energy source like this exists.

06:48.570 --> 06:51.370
The ships I'm creating for us
work on the same principle,

06:51.450 --> 06:54.000
and the ore from the comet
practically engineers itself.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.460
It's frightening, in a way.

06:56.540 --> 06:59.920
Endlessly powerful ships
for the Galra Empire.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.510
And an endless source of clean
energy for the entire system.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.670
Of course.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.510
Huh?

07:06.590 --> 07:07.791
What is that?

07:08.640 --> 07:11.060
I sent some signals into
the neighboring reality

07:11.140 --> 07:13.600
and this creature answered the call.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.100
Nothing from our universe

07:15.180 --> 07:18.060
has been able to survive the
passage through the rift.

07:18.150 --> 07:20.776
But somehow, he arrived unharmed.

07:20.896 --> 07:22.070
What?

07:22.190 --> 07:24.780
I thought we discussed this.
We must exercise caution.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.700
We have no idea what is out there.

07:26.820 --> 07:28.585
The ancients thought that lightning

07:28.705 --> 07:30.410
was shot from the bows of the gods

07:30.490 --> 07:32.450
until science proved otherwise.

07:32.530 --> 07:34.389
We must always push

07:34.509 --> 07:35.920
into dangerous territory

07:36.040 --> 07:38.080
in pursuit of knowledge.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.931
King Alfor and Honerva erected

07:58.051 --> 07:59.980
a particle barrier around the crater,

08:00.060 --> 08:02.020
containing the creatures.

08:02.110 --> 08:03.650
But it wouldn't hold forever.

08:05.940 --> 08:08.950
The barrier is weakening.
We don't have long.

08:09.070 --> 08:10.689
Once those creatures escape,

08:10.809 --> 08:12.780
my forces will quickly be overrun.

08:12.870 --> 08:14.830
My planet, my people...

08:14.910 --> 08:19.920
- Alfor's project will save us.
- Let us hope.

08:22.580 --> 08:25.420
I trust this plan of
yours will work, Alfor.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.930
By Willow!

08:40.270 --> 08:42.400
Incredible.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.931
Alfor, they're amazing.

08:45.051 --> 08:46.316
How do they work?

08:46.527 --> 08:47.778
I made them from the

08:47.898 --> 08:49.650
quintessence-infused ore of the comet,

08:49.740 --> 08:52.530
which provides them with
an endless supply of power.

08:52.610 --> 08:54.937
- Remarkable!
- The comet alloy

08:55.057 --> 08:57.490
also renders them nearly indestructible.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.847
What sort of weaponry do they have?

08:59.967 --> 09:03.220
This is where things
become more interesting.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.920
Altean alchemy can accomplish

09:05.000 --> 09:07.050
some incredible feats of
engineering, as you know.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.590
But in testing my ship,

09:09.670 --> 09:12.930
I started to feel some
sort of psychic link.

09:13.050 --> 09:14.755
I'm not sure how to explain it, but

09:14.875 --> 09:16.930
the ship wasn't just reading my mind.

09:17.010 --> 09:19.680
It was communicating with me.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.512
They seem to be evolving.

09:21.632 --> 09:23.810
We don't yet know what
powers these ships possess,

09:23.900 --> 09:25.917
but we may gain understanding with time.

09:26.037 --> 09:27.136
Time?

09:27.256 --> 09:29.597
Time slips away even as we stand here.

09:29.717 --> 09:31.428
My people will soon be slaughtered by

09:31.548 --> 09:33.360
dark creatures from another realm.

09:33.450 --> 09:36.620
Without these ships, all hope is lost.

09:38.181 --> 09:39.500
I understand.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.290
It may take some doing.

09:42.370 --> 09:45.098
These are not regular ships
to be chosen at a whim.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.460
You do not pick the beast.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.800
The beast will choose you.

10:00.890 --> 10:02.520
Yeah!

10:09.780 --> 10:11.320
Now, go easy at the beginning.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.450
This is greater energy than you
have ever worked with before.

10:14.570 --> 10:16.950
Perhaps you should lead
the formation, Alfor.

10:17.030 --> 10:19.790
You have a greater understanding
of the vessels than anyone.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.580
I'm a better alchemist than
military leader, Zarkon.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.620
I'll stick with being your right hand.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.290
Very well, then. On my mark, Paladins!

10:27.380 --> 10:30.710
Right flank, Alfor and Blaytz.
Left flank, Trigel and Gyrgan.

11:01.910 --> 11:04.830
Paladins, I'll fly ahead
and divert its attention.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.500
The rest of you, attack from all sides!

11:12.130 --> 11:13.510
Fire!

11:16.630 --> 11:18.300
Keep firing!

11:32.230 --> 11:34.480
These blasted things are covering me!

11:35.938 --> 11:37.150
Blaytz!

11:46.000 --> 11:48.500
- Th-Thanks, Alfor!
- Anytime.

11:50.130 --> 11:51.840
Spinning head smash!

12:00.840 --> 12:03.214
- I can't hit it!
- Fall back, Paladins!

12:03.334 --> 12:05.070
We must regroup!

12:06.810 --> 12:09.350
Wait! We must come
together in formation.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.810
What? Why?

12:10.900 --> 12:13.570
I don't know, but somehow I can feel it.

12:22.225 --> 12:24.319
Hey, I feel it!

12:24.439 --> 12:26.370
I do, too! What's happening?

12:32.960 --> 12:34.420
Voltron.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.520
I can't believe we did it!

12:53.610 --> 12:55.230
How did this come about?

12:55.320 --> 12:57.150
Am I a leg?

12:57.230 --> 13:00.110
This power, it's unbelievable.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.820
This is Voltron.

13:16.210 --> 13:19.010
- A shield!
- Well done, Trigel!

13:35.603 --> 13:38.625
It's trying to rip into us!

13:38.745 --> 13:40.323
We have to get it off!

13:44.240 --> 13:45.820
I know what to do.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.762
We must find a way to seal up this rift.

14:15.882 --> 14:19.360
- Seal the rift? Why?
- It nearly destroyed Daibazaal!

14:19.440 --> 14:22.070
Those creatures nearly
destroyed Daibazaal,

14:22.150 --> 14:24.240
and you found a way to defeat them.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.360
Zarkon, surely you agree with me.

14:26.450 --> 14:29.790
- It must be closed.
- Perhaps not.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.870
Look at what we've gained, Alfor.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.727
Your ships are the most powerful

14:33.847 --> 14:35.380
machines ever created.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.340
Who knows what else may be
discovered if we continue working?

14:38.460 --> 14:40.411
You would risk your entire planet,

14:40.531 --> 14:42.420
the entire solar system, for what?

14:42.510 --> 14:45.510
- For more power?
- You know it's more than that.

14:45.590 --> 14:48.510
We already have Voltron. You
have to know when it's enough.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.430
I'll decide what's enough on my planet!

14:53.230 --> 14:55.198
I'm sorry, Alfor.

14:55.318 --> 14:57.230
The work will continue.

14:58.043 --> 15:00.795
Honerva continued her
experiments on the rift.

15:00.915 --> 15:02.440
Despite their differences,

15:02.530 --> 15:05.150
Zarkon and Alfor, along
with the other paladins,

15:05.240 --> 15:08.530
established a new era of
peace and prosperity.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.660
It was an age of exploration,

15:10.780 --> 15:12.404
and Voltron became known as

15:12.524 --> 15:14.330
the Defender of the Universe,

15:14.410 --> 15:17.420
establishing the legend that
would live on to this day.

15:23.411 --> 15:25.168
I heard there were three

15:25.288 --> 15:27.509
- more earthquakes this movement.
- Don't worry,

15:27.629 --> 15:30.760
I'm installing stabilizers to
strengthen the planet's cohesion.

15:30.850 --> 15:33.390
Zarkon, my scientists
have scanned Daibazaal.

15:33.938 --> 15:36.940
It is fracturing. Soon, the
structural integrity will...

15:37.020 --> 15:38.768
I can't stop Honerva's work now!

15:38.888 --> 15:40.761
She's discovering more every day!

15:42.940 --> 15:44.650
Her team has developed a space cruiser

15:44.730 --> 15:47.320
five times the size of
our current largest ship.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.079
But that's nothing.

15:49.199 --> 15:52.370
Hello, Honerva. It's been deca-phoebs.

15:52.450 --> 15:55.830
I hope you haven't come to
try to shut down my work.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.595
There is more hidden knowledge

15:57.715 --> 15:59.420
and power in this tiny fissure

15:59.500 --> 16:01.880
than you can possibly understand.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.840
I'm only worried about the stability...

16:03.920 --> 16:06.970
Is that Kova? How old is he?

16:07.050 --> 16:10.590
Twenty-eight deca-phoebs old.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.180
Shortly after the creatures
attacked, he fell ill.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.948
But then, I began treating

16:16.068 --> 16:18.047
him with quintessence.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.625
No.

16:19.745 --> 16:22.110
He revealed the truth to us.

16:22.230 --> 16:23.832
Quintessence is so much more

16:23.952 --> 16:26.070
than you can understand.

16:26.150 --> 16:29.200
- It is life itself.
- You've gone too far.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.479
- You've always been a coward.
- Honerva, you...

16:32.599 --> 16:34.950
You wish to close off our
gateway to enlightenment.

16:35.040 --> 16:37.000
We should be expanding it!

16:37.120 --> 16:38.468
If we use Voltron,

16:38.588 --> 16:41.000
we can enlarge the
opening to the other reality.

16:41.892 --> 16:43.522
It's madness!

16:43.642 --> 16:45.256
This prolonged exposure to

16:45.376 --> 16:47.300
quintessence has poisoned your minds!

16:47.420 --> 16:49.550
We've only scratched the surface.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.738
We can rule this entire universe!

16:51.858 --> 16:54.430
We can live forever! All of us!

16:54.510 --> 16:56.208
I cannot be a part of this.

16:56.214 --> 16:59.105
You are only one part of Voltron, Alfor.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.810
You cannot hold us all
back because of your fear!

17:01.900 --> 17:04.560
Alfor, I lead the paladins!

17:04.650 --> 17:07.849
I command you! Alfor!

17:09.240 --> 17:11.609
Honerva? Honerva!

17:14.869 --> 17:16.369
We mu... We must...

17:16.450 --> 17:18.829
We must have... We must have it.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.119
- Get back, get back, get back...
- What is it, my love?

17:22.210 --> 17:24.420
Uh, quinte... quintessence.

17:24.500 --> 17:26.500
Quintessence is life.

17:26.589 --> 17:29.630
Into the... Into the rift.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.827
- How?
- We mu...

17:32.947 --> 17:34.800
We must... We must have Voltron.

17:34.890 --> 17:36.581
Voltron. Voltron.

17:36.701 --> 17:40.730
Voltron! Voltron. Voltron...

17:40.810 --> 17:42.230
It is the only way.

17:43.060 --> 17:46.310
Alfor tried to warn me,
but I would not listen.

17:47.147 --> 17:49.389
Now, my wife has fallen ill, and my

17:49.509 --> 17:52.110
planet is on the brink of collapse.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.149
So I must beg you,

17:54.269 --> 17:56.100
my trusted comrades,

17:56.220 --> 17:59.040
to join me on a most dangerous quest.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.851
We must close the rift,

18:00.971 --> 18:03.171
and I need Voltron to do it.

18:07.501 --> 18:09.210
We will help you.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.266
I only hope it is not too late

18:11.386 --> 18:13.449
to heal the rift in my planet...

18:13.680 --> 18:15.050
and our friendship.

18:17.175 --> 18:19.810
Alfor's compassion for his old comrade

18:19.890 --> 18:22.810
blinded him to Zarkon's true plans.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.070
Honerva told me the only
way to close the rift

18:33.150 --> 18:35.110
was to use the power
of the quintessence.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.070
We must make the opening bigger
first to gather the power.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.700
- How do we that?
- We use the sword.

18:41.750 --> 18:42.790
Form sword!

18:55.800 --> 18:59.220
- It's too much!
- Stay focused!

19:09.560 --> 19:12.230
Huh?

19:16.860 --> 19:19.620
Uh...

19:22.410 --> 19:23.790
Where are we?

19:24.620 --> 19:26.580
We've entered the rift.

19:28.080 --> 19:30.460
No! Zarkon, what are you doing?

19:35.550 --> 19:37.550
We have to get them out of here!

19:37.630 --> 19:40.180
We must hurry. The
creatures have returned!

19:44.020 --> 19:45.020
They're everywhere!

19:50.860 --> 19:52.070
Fire all lasers!

19:59.660 --> 20:01.410
Trigel, grab them!

20:03.996 --> 20:05.367
Gyrgan, Blaytz,

20:05.487 --> 20:07.624
fire your thrusters! We must leave!

20:18.590 --> 20:21.510
Zarkon's attempt to save
Honerva was in vain.

20:21.590 --> 20:24.890
They both succumbed to
overexposure of quintessence.

20:24.970 --> 20:27.310
The paladins had been
deceived by Zarkon.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.770
They had unwittingly enlarged the rift,

20:29.850 --> 20:32.810
which further destabilized
Planet Daibazaal.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.980
King Alfor was forced
to evacuate the planet.

20:36.070 --> 20:38.780
He, then, closed the rift
the only way he knew how.

20:41.110 --> 20:43.740
By destroying the Galran homeworld.

20:45.501 --> 20:47.458
King Alfor held a state funeral for

20:47.578 --> 20:49.877
Zarkon and Honerva in his royal hall.

20:49.997 --> 20:51.708
But what happened next,

20:51.828 --> 20:53.670
he could never have guessed.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.380
Mmm.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.570
- Where am I?
- Aboard your ship, sir.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.240
Take us home.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.860
I can't, sir.

21:21.950 --> 21:24.820
Daibazaal has been destroyed.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.210
My fellow Galra...

21:30.290 --> 21:34.210
King Alfor of Altea has
destroyed our planet.

21:34.290 --> 21:37.960
He must pay dearly for his crimes.

21:38.050 --> 21:40.340
Rise up and join your emperor!

21:40.420 --> 21:44.050
Revenge will be ours!

21:45.518 --> 21:47.497
Zarkon had become pure evil,

21:47.617 --> 21:49.470
obsessed only with quintessence.

21:49.930 --> 21:52.520
In order to open a new
rift between the realities,

21:52.600 --> 21:54.190
he needed Voltron.

21:54.270 --> 21:56.270
And so, the war began.

21:56.390 --> 21:57.987
The Galra immediately responded

21:58.107 --> 21:59.980
to their leader and attacked.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.990
The peaceful planets of our
system were not prepared.

22:03.070 --> 22:06.320
Soon, they had all fallen,
except for Altea.

22:06.410 --> 22:09.410
In a final attempt to keep
Voltron from Zarkon's hands,

22:09.490 --> 22:12.500
the lions were sent to the
far corners of the universe.

22:12.580 --> 22:14.920
Zarkon flew into a rage.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.460
He killed King Alfor,

22:16.540 --> 22:18.627
then avenged the loss of Daibazaal

22:18.747 --> 22:21.105
with the destruction of Altea.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.800
So, that's Lotor's plan.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.824
To cross into other universes and get

22:25.944 --> 22:28.050
the purest quintessence possible.

22:28.140 --> 22:31.220
No matter what, we have to stop him.

22:38.730 --> 22:42.110
Husband. How could I have forgotten?

22:42.190 --> 22:45.027
You brought me back to life long ago.

22:45.147 --> 22:48.830
Now, come back for me.
