WEBVTT

01:21.833 --> 01:22.876
Oh, yeah!

01:22.959 --> 01:25.003
I knew it! I knew it.

01:25.086 --> 01:27.172
Kevin! As soon as
I heard that wrapper.

01:27.255 --> 01:29.090
You really have
to say, "Oh, yeah,"

01:29.174 --> 01:30.383
every time you
eat a candy bar?

01:30.467 --> 01:33.636
I can't help it, Oscar.
It's just really good.

01:34.596 --> 01:35.889
Oh, yeah!

01:35.972 --> 01:37.891
My hands are tied.
All right, not bad at all.

01:37.974 --> 01:40.935
I think we can beat 20 minutes,
though, so let's try again.

01:41.019 --> 01:42.270
Get it all out
now if you have to.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.564
It was a raccoon eating a
hamburger like a person.

01:44.647 --> 01:46.816
You need to stop banging
your pen on your desk,

01:46.900 --> 01:48.526
or it's gonna drive me insane.
Okay, got it.

01:48.610 --> 01:50.153
Does anyone have
a first-aid kit?

01:50.236 --> 01:51.488
Check out
this song I wrote.

01:51.571 --> 01:53.198
I'm gonna love you
downstairs tonight

01:53.281 --> 01:55.116
Listen, I say...

01:55.200 --> 01:57.285
I mean, he looked
like a little Hamburglar.

01:57.702 --> 01:59.037
All right, here we go!

01:59.120 --> 02:02.916
Everybody, get ready in three, two...
Good luck. One.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.638
Love letters.
Yes, I love it.

02:16.721 --> 02:19.265
What else can be
done with paper?

02:19.349 --> 02:21.684
You can write
a book about chairs.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.978
Books. Excellent, Jim.

02:24.062 --> 02:26.272
All right, Andy,
please, please, just stop.

02:26.356 --> 02:28.733
You can do infinite things with paper.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.778
Did you hear that?

02:31.861 --> 02:37.534
Infinity. There is an infinity of
things that you can do with paper.

02:37.617 --> 02:40.912
Now, who wants
to buy some paper?

02:40.995 --> 02:42.622
Yeah!

02:43.581 --> 02:45.416
Very nice.
Very nice sales pitch

02:45.583 --> 02:47.418
for our clients that
don't know what paper is.

02:47.502 --> 02:49.462
I'm talking about you guys.

02:50.255 --> 02:53.883
Who in this room right now
wants to buy some paper?

02:54.759 --> 02:57.428
Let's get high
on our own supply.

02:57.512 --> 03:00.181
Andy, you want us
to buy our own paper?

03:00.265 --> 03:01.432
Yes.

03:01.516 --> 03:04.310
Robert said that we needed to
double our sales growth to 8%

03:04.394 --> 03:08.356
by the end of the quarter. That's
today, and we are $830 short.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.776
And I can't afford
to keep buying paper from us,

03:11.860 --> 03:15.238
so today we need to
sell $830 of paper,

03:15.321 --> 03:16.865
and then next quarter,
I need to sell

03:16.948 --> 03:18.992
the $2,200 of paper
that's in my garage.

03:20.285 --> 03:23.997
Animals, machines,
vast virtual armies.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.583
All of these things
I have successfully managed.

03:26.666 --> 03:28.960
The only thing I
haven't managed is people.

03:30.128 --> 03:32.046
I saw an ad on
the Sabre website

03:32.130 --> 03:34.799
for an open manager position
in their printers division.

03:34.883 --> 03:36.718
I spoke to Robert
California about it,

03:36.801 --> 03:39.053
and he said for me to come by
and see him some time.

03:39.137 --> 03:41.681
So like
a Spanish conquistador,

03:41.764 --> 03:45.226
I have come to Florida to claim
what is rightfully mine.

03:45.310 --> 03:47.478
Dwight Schrute for
Robert California.

03:47.562 --> 03:51.399
Oh. Hello, Mr. Schrute. I'll tell him you're here.
Can I get you anything at all?

03:51.482 --> 03:53.026
I'm not here to
be given anything.

03:53.109 --> 03:54.569
I'm here to take
what is mine.

03:54.652 --> 03:58.364
Ooh. I'm glad you're on our team.
Here, please have a seat.

03:59.991 --> 04:02.577
Dwight?
What are you doing here?

04:03.119 --> 04:05.788
Gabe. You don't know?

04:06.122 --> 04:07.415
Of course I know.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.168
Hmm. Impressive
office you have here.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.922
Surrounded by shrubbery.
Like a squirrel's office.

04:14.005 --> 04:17.050
Corporate says to me, "Gabe,
we need you in Scranton."

04:17.133 --> 04:19.010
Scranton says,
"Gabe, go back down

04:19.093 --> 04:21.179
to Florida.
You're needed there."

04:21.429 --> 04:24.265
So Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I'm up there.

04:24.349 --> 04:27.894
Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, I'm down here.

04:27.977 --> 04:31.731
I can think of no better way to
confront my deathly fear of flying.

04:32.357 --> 04:33.942
Dwight
Robert.

04:34.025 --> 04:35.944
You made it.
Yes.

04:36.027 --> 04:37.612
Impressive initiative.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.865
I don't know what's worse,
the trip or the destination.

04:43.534 --> 04:47.914
Well, let me settle in.

04:48.873 --> 04:50.208
And I'll be with you shortly.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.668
Very good.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.921
Hey, C-SPAN.

04:56.381 --> 04:59.217
So my Dad says an accountant
can really help you out

04:59.300 --> 05:02.470
if they're willing to play ball.
Those were his words.

05:03.388 --> 05:06.474
Gosh, Andy, you had
a great quarter, okay?

05:06.557 --> 05:10.019
Robert will understand.
$800 is a rounding error.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.563
So make that error.
Andy, no.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.817
Hey,I can make that error. Oh...

05:15.900 --> 05:20.738
Well, it's just I know that making
errors sounds like your kind of thing,

05:20.822 --> 05:23.074
but it's a little more
complicated than that. No, I...

05:23.157 --> 05:25.493
It's just I really need
a real accountant on this.

05:27.662 --> 05:29.330
What do you say?

05:29.747 --> 05:31.958
I am leaving early today,

05:32.041 --> 05:34.919
because tonight I have a trivia
contest in Philadelphia.

05:35.003 --> 05:36.004
Aw...

05:37.422 --> 05:38.756
Any other crunch time,
I would love

05:38.881 --> 05:40.174
to stay and cook
the books for you

05:40.258 --> 05:42.343
so you can save face
in front of your CEO,

05:42.468 --> 05:45.471
but tonight is Triviacolypse.
What?

05:45.555 --> 05:47.849
It's only the biggest night
of trivia of the year.

05:47.932 --> 05:50.309
There's a $1,000 prize.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.437
I'm committed to my friends.
They're committed to me.

05:52.854 --> 05:55.773
You know what? Go. Have fun.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.945
There's a trivia contest
at a bar in Philadelphia.

06:01.070 --> 06:03.364
Stop right there. I love it.
I'm in.

06:03.448 --> 06:04.866
I didn't even say what it is.

06:04.949 --> 06:06.701
It's trivia.
In Philadelphia.

06:07.076 --> 06:11.039
But here's the best part.
The prize is $1,000,

06:11.456 --> 06:16.210
and if we win, we can use
that money to buy paper here,

06:16.294 --> 06:18.796
close the gap on our
8% profit increase.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.049
That's a great idea. Yeah.
That's a great plan.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.551
Yeah? You like it? All right.
All right, good stuff.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.720
I'm so psyched you guys are
into it, 'cause I thought...

06:25.803 --> 06:27.555
I was like,
"This sounds really stupid."

06:27.638 --> 06:29.807
You just made a good idea,
a great idea.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.976
There is one problem with this plan.
What?

06:32.060 --> 06:35.271
We'd have to leave work,
like, right now to do this.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.482
You can reduce
your prices by 10%,

06:37.565 --> 06:40.568
or we're gonna be finding a new
source for our morning bagels.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.986
All right.

06:44.822 --> 06:47.241
Gabe, I always wondered what
it is you did around here.

06:47.325 --> 06:49.452
Now I found out.
You're the bagel guy.

06:49.535 --> 06:52.747
Yeah, but not just bagels.
All unwanted problems.

06:53.790 --> 06:56.542
Question. What's the most important
appliance in your house?

06:56.834 --> 07:00.296
Meat grinder.  Too slow.
It's the toilet.

07:00.379 --> 07:02.840
And I am the toilet
of this office.

07:02.924 --> 07:04.509
I flush away
annoying problems,

07:04.634 --> 07:06.219
so others can keep
their hands clean,

07:06.302 --> 07:09.097
and just like a toilet,
I am essential.

07:10.264 --> 07:12.433
You know, Gabe,
you could have gone

07:12.517 --> 07:15.770
with garbage disposal,
incinerator, or eraser.

07:15.853 --> 07:18.314
And instead
you chose toilet.

07:18.397 --> 07:20.650
God bless you.
You are an American classic.

07:21.109 --> 07:24.946
Dwight, today is not my
day at all, I'm afraid.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.531
I'm not going to be
able to meet with you.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.826
But I'm leaving you in the
very capable hands of our COO.

07:29.909 --> 07:30.952
But I can give you
this pitch in one minute.

07:31.035 --> 07:32.120
He's gonna meet
with you later.

07:32.203 --> 07:34.789
No,no,no. I don't
want you to rush it, okay?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.667
Trust me. Meet with Bill.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.337
He's a great person to know.
I'll dialog with him tonight.

07:43.214 --> 07:46.551
CEO to COO. What a
difference a letter makes.

07:46.884 --> 07:49.554
Still an important position.
Still a chief.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.472
You're really
going to like Bill.

07:51.556 --> 07:53.724
He has me toilet
a lot of people for him.

07:57.687 --> 07:58.980
Hallway phone.
Gabe Lewis speaking.

07:59.063 --> 08:01.315
Gabe, listen to me.
Don't bother Bill with this.

08:01.399 --> 08:03.317
He needs to go put out a fire
on the home front.

08:03.401 --> 08:07.071
Just wait 20 minutes, and then I want
you to listen to Dwight's pitch.

08:07.155 --> 08:09.991
Make him feel valued.
Make him feel heard.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.450
Your wish is my command.

08:11.576 --> 08:12.994
It's a command.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.838
I don't believe this.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.592
What are you doing here, Andy?
You left us no choice.

08:27.675 --> 08:29.302
But this should put
a smile on your face.

08:29.385 --> 08:32.597
How would you like to be captain
of the Dunder Mifflin team?

08:32.680 --> 08:35.391
Although I reserve the right
to overrule you. What? No.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.643
I got a quota to hit.
I don't care how I hit it.

08:37.727 --> 08:39.395
And you guys thought
this was a good idea?

08:39.478 --> 08:40.938
I thought it was
a fun idea.

08:41.022 --> 08:44.984
There were times on the two and a half
hour drive when I experienced doubt.

08:45.067 --> 08:47.069
But that's the thing
about long drives,

08:47.195 --> 08:49.197
you know?
You're always going...

08:49.280 --> 08:51.324
This is a gay bar.
Wait, what?

08:52.074 --> 08:53.284
Everyone in here is gay?

08:53.367 --> 08:56.245
Yes. It's a gay bar, so you
guys want to go home now?

08:56.329 --> 08:57.496
No.
No.

08:57.580 --> 08:58.581
No.
Awesome.

08:58.664 --> 09:01.876
What does this say about you
that you followed me here?

09:01.959 --> 09:03.044
That you think
you're going to win

09:03.127 --> 09:05.755
your sales quota at
a gay bar's trivia night?

09:05.838 --> 09:09.508
It says that I believe
in my staff's intelligence,

09:09.592 --> 09:12.220
and that I'm
willing to try anything.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.849
Not "anything."

09:17.725 --> 09:18.726
Good luck.

09:20.770 --> 09:23.648
All right, we need to
divide up into teams,

09:23.731 --> 09:27.109
but it's winner take all,
so no need to divide evenly.

09:27.193 --> 09:31.405
We need an A team, a backup
team, and a just-have-fun team.

09:32.323 --> 09:34.367
So you guys all
know yourselves.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.327
Good timers, follow me.

09:38.037 --> 09:39.372
Back-ups.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.629
Go on, kid. You know
you don't belong here.

09:49.215 --> 09:50.800
A team.
Okay.

09:51.550 --> 09:54.553
All right, everybody,
nice self awareness.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.182
Except...

10:07.692 --> 10:08.818
Okay.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.404
There's a table over here.

10:11.696 --> 10:13.572
All right,
first question, everyone.

10:13.656 --> 10:17.201
Ray Charles famously had
this state on his mind.

10:17.285 --> 10:18.703
What is its capital?

10:18.786 --> 10:20.204
Oh, we got this.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.790
Let's reverse engineer this.

10:22.873 --> 10:24.667
You're a black singer.
Where do you go?

10:24.792 --> 10:26.585
Somewhere where
you're a novelty.

10:26.669 --> 10:28.337
Alaska.
Atlanta.

10:28.421 --> 10:31.215
I know you think that, because
that's where the Olympics were held.

10:31.299 --> 10:32.925
My cousins were
actually at those Olympics.

10:33.009 --> 10:34.969
Keep talking all you want.

10:35.386 --> 10:38.180
How am I supposed to know
what was on his mind?

10:38.264 --> 10:40.349
Ooh! What do blind
people think about?

10:40.433 --> 10:45.479
Okay, dogs, canes, signs, manholes,
stairs, piano, darkness.

10:45.563 --> 10:48.899
Okay, time's up.
Let's get the boards up.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.027
Atlanta, Georgia is
the correct answer.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.075
What?

10:59.201 --> 11:00.536
Hey, man. Uh...

11:00.619 --> 11:03.331
Look, unfortunately,
Bill had to go fight a fire,

11:03.414 --> 11:05.333
so, your appointment got...

11:05.416 --> 11:07.335
There's no fires
within eight miles of here.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.670
Well, it's nine miles away.

11:09.754 --> 11:11.756
I'm going to be meeting
with you on his behalf.

11:11.839 --> 11:15.468
What? No, no.
Excuse me, lady!

11:15.551 --> 11:19.472
Get anyone from the COO's office
on the phone this instant!

11:19.555 --> 11:21.932
This must be
very frustrating.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.771
I can see you in
the jungle now.

11:28.522 --> 11:32.360
Hey, now, you're not an All-Star of
the NBA, but you did get your game on

11:32.443 --> 11:36.322
when you won the NBA 's Sixth
Man of the Year Award in 2011.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.865
Who are you?

11:37.948 --> 11:39.617
Jim, Darryl,
your time to shine.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.702
Shawn Marion.
Yes. Shawn Marion.

11:41.786 --> 11:45.122
That doesn't sound right. I want
to say LaDamien Washington?

11:45.206 --> 11:46.457
Wrong for so many reasons.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.209
Well, I know
Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man

11:48.334 --> 11:50.044
was Richard Burton.
Is that helpful?

11:50.378 --> 11:53.714
That's it. I'm gonna go watch
the boats on the river.

11:53.798 --> 11:55.424
Ron Artest, Kelly.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.176
No, it's Lamar Odom.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.219
If it had been Ron Artest,
it would have

11:58.302 --> 11:59.720
come up on
Dancing with the Stars

11:59.804 --> 12:00.930
when they pan
over his trophy case

12:01.013 --> 12:02.807
when he's at home
with his family.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.726
Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big
storyline on KhloÃ© and Lamar.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.604
All right, boards up.
Let's see who got it.

12:09.647 --> 12:11.315
Lamar Odom is what
we were looking for.

12:12.525 --> 12:13.567
Lamar Odom.

12:13.651 --> 12:14.693
Oh, my God,
Lamar Odom.

12:14.819 --> 12:15.861
Nice. Nicely done.

12:15.945 --> 12:19.698
You're my sports guys. You're ESPN.
You're ESPN Classic.

12:19.782 --> 12:22.952
Ryan is MSNBC.
I'm El, TLC and Oxygen.

12:23.035 --> 12:25.621
Chill, man.
This plan is airtight.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.208
So it's a very
simple argument

12:29.291 --> 12:32.670
of why I should be put in charge
of southeast printer sales.

12:32.753 --> 12:36.340
Nobody has sold more printers
in the northeast than me.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.927
Bottom line, I know the product.
I get it.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.846
Well, you got my vote.

12:44.098 --> 12:45.558
Oh, my God.
Yeah.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.727
Most of all, I believe
that character is destiny,

12:49.061 --> 12:51.605
and my character
is one that...

12:51.689 --> 12:53.941
Wait, why are you smiling?

12:54.024 --> 12:55.359
What?
What's with the smile?

12:55.651 --> 12:58.237
You're doing great.
So good.

12:59.530 --> 13:01.532
And my character is one
that will never give up

13:01.615 --> 13:05.453
until greatness is on
the horizon behind us.

13:07.121 --> 13:11.500
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation.
Put your hand on my hand.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.213
Flush.

13:17.006 --> 13:18.007
Ow!

13:18.090 --> 13:19.800
Take me to Robert.
Ow. He went home.

13:19.884 --> 13:21.677
Take me to his house.
It's a condo.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.761
It's long-term
business housing.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.346
You know where it is.
Lead me there.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.723
Ow. Stephanie, help.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.810
Listen, you're
a perfectly fine toilet.

13:29.894 --> 13:33.147
I'm just an extraordinary
piece of crap. Let's go.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.231
Ow.

13:35.191 --> 13:37.693
Excuse me, sir,
on the Dunder Mifflin A team.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.487
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.989
I'm sure you're just checking
your Grindr account.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.826
But you can't
check smartphones

13:45.910 --> 13:47.536
during trivia.
It's against the rules.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.246
Okay, I'm turning it off.

13:50.748 --> 13:52.041
Okay, you're not
turning it off.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.501
I won't look at it.

13:53.584 --> 13:54.627
Sir.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.213
I can't not touch it.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.216
Okay, then we're gonna
have to take it away.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.178
Thank you. Thank you.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.765
Okay, I can't not
have my phone. I'm sorry.

14:08.974 --> 14:11.227
I want to be with my phone.

14:11.936 --> 14:15.189
All right, guys, after nine
rounds, let's check the scores.

14:15.272 --> 14:18.609
In first place with nine
points, it's Aesop's Foibles.

14:20.236 --> 14:23.030
The Queerenstein
Bears have seven points.

14:23.614 --> 14:25.991
Dunder Mifflin
A team has four points.

14:26.075 --> 14:27.034
All right.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.037
The D.M. Backup Team
has three points.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.581
The Einsteins have eight points.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.709
Ladies Gaga have five points.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.835
Yeah!

14:37.044 --> 14:38.504
So our best chance
of hitting our mark

14:38.587 --> 14:42.925
is now in the hands and brains of
Kevin, Meredith, Erin and Kelly.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.176
Do I like these odds?

14:45.302 --> 14:46.929
My answer is no.
Whoo!

14:48.973 --> 14:51.225
Which one is it? I don't know!
All I know is the building.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.812
Robert! Robert California!

14:55.646 --> 14:57.189
Dwight
Robert!

14:59.441 --> 15:01.986
How nice of Gabe to
show you where I live.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.737
Come around. 102.

15:03.821 --> 15:05.906
All right, guys, time's up.

15:05.990 --> 15:08.742
Who was the relatively
unknown patent clerk

15:08.826 --> 15:10.744
who discovered
that energy equals

15:10.869 --> 15:12.746
mass times
the speed of light squared?

15:12.830 --> 15:14.999
Looks like everyone gets a
point for Albert Einstein.

15:16.417 --> 15:19.169
Wait, except
for the Einsteins.

15:20.004 --> 15:21.422
That's all right.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.340
Which means
the top three teams

15:23.507 --> 15:25.342
are going to finish it
off in the speed round.

15:25.426 --> 15:27.177
So let's get
everyone some bells.

15:27.261 --> 15:30.055
In third place,
we have the Einsteins.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.724
Oh, yeah!
What?

15:33.434 --> 15:36.812
Second place, we have
the Queerenstein Bears.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.980
Yeah!
Come on!

15:38.063 --> 15:40.357
And first place
is Aesop's Foibles.

15:40.441 --> 15:41.442
Whoo!

15:43.152 --> 15:45.404
Yeah, but they're
going to get clobbered.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.407
Ring it in when you know it.
First question.

15:48.490 --> 15:51.535
This man had a fatwa
declared on him when...

15:53.037 --> 15:54.288
Einsteins?

15:54.371 --> 15:55.956
What?
What is it?

15:56.040 --> 15:58.500
I did my part, babe.
I'm just the bell girl.

15:58.584 --> 15:59.835
Aesop's?

15:59.918 --> 16:02.171
Salman Rushdie.
Salman Rushdie is correct.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.384
Heading out to sea, sailors.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.596
On a square-rigged
ship, the sail

16:10.721 --> 16:12.848
set furthest
forward is called what?

16:14.725 --> 16:16.060
Princess Ding-Dong,
do not hit that bell...

16:16.226 --> 16:17.561
Flying jib.

16:17.853 --> 16:20.606
Flying jib is
correct for the Einsteins.

16:25.069 --> 16:26.654
Flying jib. Flying jib.

16:26.779 --> 16:28.364
No Way.

16:30.449 --> 16:31.617
Gentlemen.

16:35.245 --> 16:39.041
Give us just a minute. Stew and I
are just finishing up our lesson.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.919
Trust me,
one nine-minute bout

16:42.503 --> 16:46.924
is a cardiovascular equivalent of
running uphill for three hours.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.887
I could go to
the gym three times a week,

16:51.970 --> 16:53.639
or I can wrestle
Stew once a month.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.482
Grab my leg!

17:04.525 --> 17:06.068
Yay, Robert!

17:06.151 --> 17:09.613
Guys, please help yourself to
some drinks from the fridge.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.200
According to a recent survey,

17:13.283 --> 17:17.204
this is the most common learning
disability among American adolescents.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.665
Boom! ADHD.
No.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.710
Wrong. The
answer is dyslexia!

17:22.960 --> 17:24.545
That's correct
for the Einsteins.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.883
All right.
Whoo! Yeah!

17:29.967 --> 17:34.054
Sir, sir. Dial it back. This
isn't Tail Feathers, okay?

17:39.143 --> 17:40.144
Yeah!

17:40.602 --> 17:43.772
They haven't really improved
on the Oreo, have they?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.067
No, thank you.

17:47.151 --> 17:48.777
Sit down, Dwight.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.158
Let me tell you
why I should be

17:54.324 --> 17:55.993
the next manager
with a riddle.

17:57.286 --> 18:00.164
A manager,
a salesman, a leader

18:00.289 --> 18:03.167
and a warrior walk
into a restaurant.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.253
The hostess says,
"Table for one?"

18:07.296 --> 18:08.714
How is this possible?

18:10.090 --> 18:13.010
You were dining alone.
All those people are you.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.346
Yes. Exactly. Riddle number two.
Who is going...

18:17.556 --> 18:24.313
Your drive, your ambition, it would
be wasted on a manager's job.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.107
And Florida,
you don't want to live here.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.692
Even I don't
want to live here.

18:28.776 --> 18:31.028
It's why I'm always at
my place in Scranton.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.114
Florida is America's basement.

18:34.198 --> 18:39.953
It's wet. It's filled with mold,
strange insects, alligators.

18:40.037 --> 18:43.123
Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight.
You know that, right?

18:43.207 --> 18:45.250
Eh... It's complicated.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.384
This medal was
my grandfather's.

18:55.761 --> 19:01.600
He received it for acts of
courage, for excellence.

19:03.227 --> 19:07.731
It's a tribute
one man gives another.

19:08.774 --> 19:11.527
I could give you
a job, Dwight.

19:11.610 --> 19:15.364
But why not let me give you
something even better?

19:22.454 --> 19:25.207
It's a job interview.
Not a flea market.

19:28.377 --> 19:30.254
Dwight, the job is
not right for you.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.464
Now, when something
comes along

19:32.589 --> 19:34.758
that is right for you,
I'll try you out.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.262
Now get the hell
out of my place.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.513
Yes.

19:39.596 --> 19:43.350
Final round.
Last two teams squaring off.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.435
I hope you're
ready to play doctor.

19:45.519 --> 19:48.522
Our question is about
health and the human body.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.731
Oh, come on.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.192
The standard
American analog scale

19:52.317 --> 19:54.736
has a maximum capacity of what weight?

19:55.070 --> 19:57.030
Three hundred pounds.

19:57.114 --> 19:59.157
Point for the Einsteins.

19:59.992 --> 20:03.871
Here's your final question. Cinephiles,
put on your memory berets.

20:03.954 --> 20:08.250
This 2001 masterpiece
from Gilles Paquet-Brenner

20:08.333 --> 20:12.004
explores the intricate dynamics
of a family in disarray.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.719
Yes!

20:18.802 --> 20:21.513
I'm sorry, no.
Over to the Einsteins.

20:21.597 --> 20:24.141
- Les Jolies Choses.
- Are you sure?

20:24.975 --> 20:29.187
Marion Cotillard
exposes herself

20:29.271 --> 20:31.481
a number of times
in that film.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.566
The Einsteins win it.

20:32.649 --> 20:33.734
No!
Yeah!

20:33.817 --> 20:35.235
Come on!

20:36.904 --> 20:40.657
Look, I know it's easy to say
tonight was just a fluke,

20:40.741 --> 20:44.244
and maybe it was,
but here's a piece of trivia.

20:44.328 --> 20:48.081
A fluke is one of the most
common fish in the sea.

20:48.165 --> 20:51.168
So if you go
fishing for a fluke,

20:51.293 --> 20:54.296
chances are you
just might catch one.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.173
Oh, boy.

20:58.008 --> 21:01.678
Welcome to the Stonewall
Alliance Trivia Championships!

21:02.346 --> 21:05.807
First prize is $2,500.

21:05.891 --> 21:09.770
Let's just do our thing, collect our
hardware, and get the hell home.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.480
Whoo!
Riboflavin.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.232
Riboflavin?

21:14.316 --> 21:15.400
Michigan.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.365
The President of
the United States

21:22.032 --> 21:23.367
is POTUS.

21:24.368 --> 21:27.913
John Steinbeck wrote
The Grapes of Wrath.
