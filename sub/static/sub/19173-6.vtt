WEBVTT

00:06.094 --> 00:08.894
You want to trade the cache, my cache?

00:09.013 --> 00:11.346
It was the only way
we could avoid a fight

00:11.448 --> 00:13.482
we were more than likely to lose.

00:13.584 --> 00:16.201
- Mr. Scott?
- He told me that he feared

00:16.226 --> 00:18.569
for the safety of his
wife and his daughter.

00:18.594 --> 00:20.511
- Are they still alive?
- Yes, they are.

00:20.557 --> 00:23.458
They revolted. A man
named Julius started it.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.627
Now he's forming an army out there

00:25.652 --> 00:27.763
with designs on taking Nassau.

00:27.788 --> 00:30.465
The damage done to this
alliance was caused by Billy.

00:30.490 --> 00:33.164
It may be that the only
way to repair this damage

00:33.189 --> 00:35.727
is to remove that which caused it.

00:37.574 --> 00:39.174
Stop!

00:39.276 --> 00:40.633
What the hell have you done?

00:40.658 --> 00:43.578
If the British empire will not aid
us in fighting our present enemy,

00:43.680 --> 00:45.781
perhaps a different empire will.

00:45.883 --> 00:49.451
Once you land, I envision no confusion.

00:49.553 --> 00:53.055
I'd simply ask that you
burn it all to the ground.

02:54.678 --> 02:57.279
When your people took this place,

02:57.381 --> 02:59.915
it was they who suffered
the consequences.

03:00.642 --> 03:03.564
Reprisals visited upon their mothers,

03:03.589 --> 03:05.830
brothers, children.

03:06.393 --> 03:10.228
Tortured on the other farms
as a result of your actions.

03:10.916 --> 03:12.916
I understand.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.198
Which is why I've come
here to make that right.

03:17.534 --> 03:19.768
If you had suffered such loss,

03:19.870 --> 03:21.636
is there anything you can imagine

03:21.738 --> 03:23.220
making it right?

03:24.575 --> 03:27.742
No. I can't.

03:29.213 --> 03:33.248
But I imagine getting my hands
on the man responsible for it...

03:33.350 --> 03:35.159
would be a start.

03:37.921 --> 03:41.770
He completed the raid when
my friends tried to stop it.

03:42.626 --> 03:45.093
He chained those he felt
most likely to revolt

03:45.195 --> 03:47.062
over the offense.

03:47.164 --> 03:49.746
Though, I imagine they know this.

03:51.963 --> 03:53.883
With what conditions?

03:53.908 --> 03:55.570
Two of them.

03:55.672 --> 03:58.431
They respect you, so
they'll listen to you.

03:58.478 --> 04:01.476
I'd ask your help in
mending this alliance,

04:01.578 --> 04:03.712
both with the men and women here

04:03.814 --> 04:06.826
and those elsewhere on the island.

04:07.265 --> 04:10.767
I understand there's now a
band of armed slaves out there.

04:11.256 --> 04:14.670
I need to know you can
broker a peace with them, too.

04:16.493 --> 04:18.293
And the other condition?

04:19.696 --> 04:23.006
That he's alive at the
end of whatever happens.

05:25.562 --> 05:27.362
You trust him?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.100
Flint.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.076
You've cast your lot with him.

05:38.075 --> 05:40.075
What does it matter to you?

05:43.374 --> 05:47.415
Before this war began, before
everyone's roles changed,

05:47.517 --> 05:51.086
your father mistrusted Flint
as much as anyone in Nassau did.

05:51.327 --> 05:55.234
I assume you were in some
contact with him all that time.

05:56.059 --> 05:59.527
I'm surprised that his
feelings didn't influence you.

06:06.703 --> 06:08.892
You were my sister.

06:10.307 --> 06:11.940
There is very little that I remember

06:11.965 --> 06:13.675
from when I was young,

06:13.777 --> 06:15.877
but I remember this.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.010
You were older.

06:19.316 --> 06:21.202
You were beautiful.

06:21.785 --> 06:23.718
I revered you.

06:28.792 --> 06:31.827
When you were told that
my mother and I were dead,

06:32.229 --> 06:34.729
I have to believe that it affected you.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.566
You had just lost your mother.

06:39.736 --> 06:42.291
But if things were as I remember,

06:42.739 --> 06:45.573
my mother and I were your family, too.

06:48.335 --> 06:51.079
And yet, through all
the years thereafter

06:51.104 --> 06:52.847
that my father cared for you...

06:53.630 --> 06:57.788
counseled you, labored for you...

06:59.489 --> 07:02.004
he never told you that we were alive.

07:02.371 --> 07:05.098
It would have been so easy
to lessen your suffering

07:05.123 --> 07:07.595
by divulging the secret.

07:07.697 --> 07:09.871
And yet, he never did.

07:10.434 --> 07:13.268
Have you yet asked yourself why that is?

07:20.544 --> 07:23.211
My father didn't mistrust Flint.

07:25.195 --> 07:27.800
My father mistrusted all of you.

07:35.912 --> 07:37.331
Lieutenant.

07:57.247 --> 07:59.214
The cache isn't here, so I am leaving.

07:59.239 --> 08:01.816
And as my collateral to ensure
that this deal is consummated,

08:01.841 --> 08:04.410
he'll be coming with me to the fort.

08:04.769 --> 08:06.613
"This deal"?

08:07.178 --> 08:10.224
As in the one in which you
walk away with all my money?

08:11.428 --> 08:12.927
It seems the only means I have

08:13.029 --> 08:14.888
of registering any
meaningful disapproval

08:14.913 --> 08:16.432
of this deal at this point

08:16.457 --> 08:18.888
is to kill one or the both of you.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.942
- How many?
- 12 total.

09:01.044 --> 09:02.361
Eight ships of force.

09:02.386 --> 09:04.736
They'll be in range
in an hour, maybe less.

09:04.986 --> 09:07.375
Grab the ledgers and
whatever coin is on hand.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.716
Where are we going?

09:08.818 --> 09:11.377
You're going to inform Mr.
Silver what's happening.

09:11.402 --> 09:12.816
We're getting onto the Walrus

09:12.841 --> 09:16.527
and we're getting it and us out of here.

09:34.044 --> 09:35.952
If we're still here when
they make their landing,

09:35.977 --> 09:37.506
none of us will survive the day.

09:37.531 --> 09:39.564
You would surrender our
position to the Spanish Navy?

09:39.645 --> 09:41.583
You were prepared to
surrender this position

09:41.608 --> 09:43.695
to Long John Silver
just a few hours ago.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.232
And in this case, our lives
may very well depend upon it.

09:47.257 --> 09:49.657
Spanish forces, sir,
will offer no quarter.

09:49.682 --> 09:51.349
We have no choice but
to defend ourselves!

09:51.374 --> 09:53.064
Quiet, please.

09:56.066 --> 09:57.986
What is it, Lieutenant?

09:59.302 --> 10:01.336
The lead ship that approaches,

10:01.438 --> 10:03.981
she's just posted a signal to us.

10:05.411 --> 10:08.942
It was Governor Rogers' signal
ordering us to stand down.

10:10.747 --> 10:12.145
His signal?

10:15.929 --> 10:18.020
Could it have been stolen?

10:19.723 --> 10:21.856
It's from our most recent signal book.

10:23.093 --> 10:24.726
Then I think our response is obvious.

10:24.828 --> 10:26.649
We will follow his orders.

10:26.674 --> 10:29.664
Obviously, he has
enlisted Spanish assistance

10:29.689 --> 10:31.946
in forcing the pirates out of Nassau.

10:31.971 --> 10:34.302
If we stand down, the
invasion proceeds around us

10:34.327 --> 10:35.626
and we will remain safe here.

10:35.651 --> 10:37.439
And what about Eleanor?

10:37.464 --> 10:38.763
What about her?

10:39.164 --> 10:40.842
She is out there.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.444
Someone must retrieve her
before those troops arrive.

10:43.546 --> 10:45.213
Before we could retrieve her and return,

10:45.238 --> 10:47.271
that invasion would be fully unleashed.

10:47.296 --> 10:49.984
It would be suicide for
anyone to attempt it.

10:53.456 --> 10:55.123
Where are you going?

11:07.288 --> 11:09.116
_

11:12.960 --> 11:14.522
_

11:16.944 --> 11:19.217
_

11:20.194 --> 11:23.100
_

11:26.435 --> 11:27.833
_

11:27.858 --> 11:29.693
_

11:29.740 --> 11:32.958
_

12:20.443 --> 12:22.810
He's in the field with the sign.

12:38.261 --> 12:40.194
I did not want this.

12:49.272 --> 12:51.556
Flint is my friend,

12:51.704 --> 12:54.025
but I know what he is.

12:54.658 --> 12:57.278
I have no illusions about it.

12:59.115 --> 13:02.027
But for all the dangers he presents,

13:02.052 --> 13:04.918
for all his offenses...

13:05.789 --> 13:10.558
the one thing he's never done is
force me to choose between him and you.

13:13.062 --> 13:16.355
That, you did.

13:20.904 --> 13:24.372
But it isn't too late to
find a way to remedy it.

13:40.256 --> 13:42.979
You made a terrible mistake

13:43.004 --> 13:45.126
and you paid a terrible price.

13:47.098 --> 13:49.302
But we're at war...

13:49.492 --> 13:51.771
and you're an asset.

13:53.203 --> 13:55.693
Despite what's gone on,

13:55.718 --> 13:57.863
you are my friend.

14:01.110 --> 14:04.145
And the men out there have
had their pound of flesh.

14:04.247 --> 14:06.169
And our men...

14:06.974 --> 14:08.857
Billy, I could walk out there

14:08.882 --> 14:11.886
and tell them the sky is red...

14:11.988 --> 14:13.721
and they'd believe me.

14:15.103 --> 14:17.792
That's the power you've given me.

14:19.183 --> 14:22.267
But I have to know this is over...

14:23.333 --> 14:26.364
your vendetta against Flint,

14:27.049 --> 14:31.466
your need to see him dead
or departed from our story.

14:32.809 --> 14:37.761
I have to know you'll never put
me to a choice between you again.

14:39.716 --> 14:41.415
Swear it...

14:42.447 --> 14:44.683
and this all ends.

14:55.985 --> 14:57.932
You chose.

15:02.005 --> 15:03.771
Live with it.

15:10.638 --> 15:12.138
They're here.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.448
He speaks for them?

15:24.473 --> 15:26.294
They call him Julius.

15:50.386 --> 15:52.386
- Help me out.
- Won't do it by itself.

15:57.093 --> 15:58.693
Over there.

16:01.297 --> 16:02.830
Pretty sight for you.

16:31.514 --> 16:34.061
I came to find Eleanor.

16:41.871 --> 16:43.738
"I betrayed you, Jack.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.274
"Tried to trade your life
for my own personal gain.

16:46.299 --> 16:48.772
"Lied to Anne to her face about it.

16:48.797 --> 16:51.112
"Please, Jack. Beg of you.

16:51.137 --> 16:52.236
"Is there any way you can forgive me?"

16:52.261 --> 16:53.547
That was the general sense I had

16:53.572 --> 16:54.982
of what I might hear
come from your mouth

16:55.007 --> 16:56.317
were I ever this close to you again.

16:56.342 --> 16:57.685
Spain is here.

16:59.084 --> 17:03.621
A fleet of a dozen ships has
already opened fire on Nassau town.

17:03.646 --> 17:05.593
By now, well over a thousand soldiers

17:05.694 --> 17:09.096
will have likely made their
landing and begun their invasion.

17:09.198 --> 17:10.405
In a matter of hours,

17:10.430 --> 17:13.892
there will be no safe place
to stand on this island,

17:13.916 --> 17:15.557
made all the more dangerous by the fact

17:15.582 --> 17:17.980
that the harbor has been
rendered defenseless.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.074
There will be no resistance
to their landing since...

17:21.098 --> 17:24.300
Since Woodes Rogers was
the one who invited them in.

17:26.049 --> 17:27.815
How did you know that?

17:27.916 --> 17:30.718
Captain! Sails!

17:31.907 --> 17:33.479
The Walrus.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.124
They escaped the harbor
ahead of their landing.

17:45.196 --> 17:47.463
Change of plan! Back to the ship.

17:47.488 --> 17:50.313
Spanish invasion. You're
welcome to stay if you like.

17:56.680 --> 17:57.961
You coming?

17:57.986 --> 17:59.844
I won't ask again.

18:27.759 --> 18:29.501
Keeping an eye on us?

18:29.526 --> 18:33.165
Making sure you don't slit my
throat out of spite, perhaps.

18:35.892 --> 18:37.447
I suppose I chose the right hostage

18:37.472 --> 18:40.033
if they're that concerned
about keeping you alive.

18:41.481 --> 18:43.314
I suppose so.

18:45.713 --> 18:47.757
You know, there was a time...

18:47.999 --> 18:51.765
not so long ago, when
you shared their concern.

18:53.602 --> 18:56.003
When you saw what I saw.

18:56.343 --> 18:59.628
The benefits of being
free of British rule.

19:01.077 --> 19:05.946
To make the new world something more
than just an extension of the old.

19:07.350 --> 19:10.384
Is it so unthinkable
that that might be again?

19:12.188 --> 19:13.888
You were a pirate once.

19:15.691 --> 19:17.725
Stranger things have happened.

19:36.067 --> 19:37.707
We need to get to cover.

19:37.864 --> 19:39.379
Quickly.

19:40.323 --> 19:41.754
Where?

19:47.990 --> 19:51.430
The governor's forces have
been driven out of Nassau.

19:51.641 --> 19:54.862
In a few hours, the last
remaining members of his regime

19:54.964 --> 19:56.764
will be surrendering the fort,

19:56.866 --> 20:00.100
leaving the island
completely under our control.

20:00.452 --> 20:02.524
It is a new day.

20:03.539 --> 20:07.885
But one that demands we all
unite behind a common cause.

20:09.378 --> 20:11.627
What cause is that?

20:12.915 --> 20:15.349
To free the new world.

20:17.086 --> 20:20.394
And we will be your partners...

20:20.902 --> 20:22.902
in the fight to free it?

20:23.210 --> 20:24.949
Yes.

20:26.429 --> 20:28.293
For how long?

20:30.099 --> 20:31.565
How long?

20:33.854 --> 20:35.269
I'm told you removed

20:35.371 --> 20:38.674
the one who governed
the pirates before you.

20:38.799 --> 20:42.015
Sacrificed him in the hopes that
it would remake this alliance...

20:42.040 --> 20:45.062
Know that man was a friend of mine...

20:45.336 --> 20:48.125
before you question the sacrifice.

20:50.119 --> 20:51.949
Amongst pirates,

20:52.510 --> 20:56.697
loyalty changes quickly, it seems.

20:56.722 --> 20:59.727
If a man can be replaced so easily,

20:59.829 --> 21:03.163
how can I know that his
promises won't be, too?

21:10.740 --> 21:13.274
Spain? Here?

21:13.376 --> 21:15.876
12 ships, likely in
excess of a thousand men.

21:15.901 --> 21:18.012
There won't be much time
before we're overrun.

21:18.114 --> 21:20.352
Mr. Featherstone awaits on
the Walrus off the south coast

21:20.377 --> 21:21.749
if we wish to retreat.

21:21.774 --> 21:23.117
If?

21:23.911 --> 21:26.046
A thousand Spanish fighters
are more than three times

21:26.071 --> 21:27.902
our number could withstand.

21:27.957 --> 21:30.157
What can we do but retreat?

21:31.260 --> 21:33.160
We're not leaving.

21:33.307 --> 21:34.895
If it's Madi that concerns you,

21:34.997 --> 21:36.463
we could send someone out to find her.

21:36.488 --> 21:38.098
We wouldn't be leaving her behind.

21:38.123 --> 21:40.324
Madi and Flint will either
find their way back here

21:40.349 --> 21:41.902
or they'll find a place to hide.

21:42.004 --> 21:44.305
But even if they were
here, we cannot retreat.

21:44.330 --> 21:46.006
Not with our numbers.

21:46.530 --> 21:48.342
The Spanish would run us down.

21:48.444 --> 21:50.210
We'd end up facing them
disorganized out there

21:50.235 --> 21:52.346
rather than entrenched here.

21:53.991 --> 21:55.616
So, what do we do?

22:07.715 --> 22:11.632
If we fight them together,
there's a good chance we live,

22:11.734 --> 22:14.465
hold our ground, maybe
even fight them off.

22:15.139 --> 22:17.621
Separate, and we all die.

22:18.246 --> 22:20.040
Retrieve your men,

22:20.142 --> 22:22.042
bring them here,

22:22.495 --> 22:26.123
and make this the last
battle to win the island.

23:10.984 --> 23:13.406
_

23:14.180 --> 23:15.703
_

23:19.711 --> 23:22.366
_

23:22.391 --> 23:23.954
_

23:24.133 --> 23:26.617
_

23:35.386 --> 23:37.471
No, no, no, no, no.

23:40.464 --> 23:41.764
Where is she?

23:42.210 --> 23:44.949
She left with an escort hours ago

23:44.974 --> 23:46.607
to make the exchange.

23:46.632 --> 23:48.332
You let her leave?

23:56.772 --> 23:59.273
Your men need to know my
wife is not to be harmed.

24:00.450 --> 24:01.503
_

24:01.528 --> 24:03.387
English, God damn it!

24:04.613 --> 24:06.380
Even if that order could be given,

24:06.405 --> 24:07.848
no one would heed it.

24:08.238 --> 24:09.871
They've been let loose.

24:10.457 --> 24:12.490
I opened the gates for you.

24:12.788 --> 24:14.988
Handed you this victory.

24:16.225 --> 24:17.891
Yes, you did.

24:18.894 --> 24:21.249
But what has begun here,

24:21.430 --> 24:23.515
there is no altering it now.

24:37.259 --> 24:39.142
Jesus Christ.

24:43.773 --> 24:46.620
I sent a rider to the
Underhill estate to warn them.

24:46.645 --> 24:49.100
Told them we'd be here to
get them off the island.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.124
But there's a credible
argument to be made

24:51.149 --> 24:53.193
that we ought to leave right away,

24:53.218 --> 24:54.995
while we still can.

25:01.403 --> 25:02.669
Hello, boys.

25:02.694 --> 25:04.838
No. We wait here.

25:05.833 --> 25:08.395
We wait here for whomever,

25:08.501 --> 25:11.130
if anyone, survives the day.

25:14.216 --> 25:18.085
If you have men you can spare,
I can use them on the Walrus.

25:18.187 --> 25:20.220
That's high enough!

25:29.398 --> 25:32.716
If there is nothing left to be
done, I would like to see her.

26:30.854 --> 26:32.768
I loved you.

26:36.565 --> 26:38.465
And I betrayed you.

26:47.445 --> 26:49.978
But I cannot apologize for it.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.381
I did what anyone would have done

26:54.406 --> 26:57.267
when confronted with the
same impossible choices.

27:00.873 --> 27:04.041
If I apologize, you
will know it is a lie.

27:06.695 --> 27:09.652
And I do not wish to
lie to you ever again.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.060
Leave.

27:19.395 --> 27:21.012
No.

27:22.378 --> 27:25.160
I am going to stay with you.

27:25.881 --> 27:28.363
I want to take care of you.

27:34.274 --> 27:36.297
Get the fuck out.

28:02.842 --> 28:04.484
Doesn't make sense.

28:04.509 --> 28:07.387
Spain has been quiet for months.
Why is this happening now?

28:11.694 --> 28:13.760
The governor sailed from here days ago,

28:13.785 --> 28:16.811
frustrated in his attempts
to retake the island.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.349
Apparently, he found
someone willing to aid him.

28:22.224 --> 28:24.074
That's not what happened.

28:26.208 --> 28:28.777
The harbor is still obstructed.

28:28.977 --> 28:31.445
How else would they manage
to enter it so cleanly

28:31.547 --> 28:32.946
unless he was in league with them?

28:32.971 --> 28:35.105
That is not what happened.

28:38.220 --> 28:40.520
Well, whatever the cause, they're here.

28:41.595 --> 28:44.186
We need to prepare a
defensive position here.

28:44.211 --> 28:48.313
We need to send out scouts to
determine the size of their force.

28:50.365 --> 28:52.899
And we need all the hands we can muster.

29:19.867 --> 29:21.528
Already?

29:21.630 --> 29:23.398
They must've tracked us here.

29:23.423 --> 29:26.024
Get inside the house, the both of you.

29:35.465 --> 29:37.198
You saw them?

29:38.714 --> 29:41.548
I think so. Beyond the trees.

29:48.341 --> 29:49.759
Wait.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.580
Now.

30:32.056 --> 30:33.810
Move! Move!

31:04.465 --> 31:07.301
If they report our position,
we'll face 50 more of them.

31:10.072 --> 31:12.192
Stay. Watch the house.

31:42.388 --> 31:43.887
It did affect me.

31:47.776 --> 31:49.171
When Mr. Scott...

31:49.196 --> 31:53.037
when your father told me that
you and your mother had died...

31:54.283 --> 31:56.316
it affected me a great deal.

32:09.497 --> 32:11.631
It must have been hard...

32:12.021 --> 32:14.589
to live hidden away for so long.

32:21.161 --> 32:23.595
It was hard to be away from him.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.147
The rest of it...

32:28.932 --> 32:31.933
my mother did the best she
could with the rest of it.

32:32.537 --> 32:34.421
She must have done well.

32:40.762 --> 32:43.263
I've found myself thinking about it.

32:44.766 --> 32:46.366
Of walking away from Nassau,

32:46.468 --> 32:48.969
from England, from civilization.

32:51.940 --> 32:54.441
One can be happy that way, can't they?

32:55.944 --> 32:58.409
A life of isolation and uncertainty

32:58.434 --> 33:01.314
as long as it is lived
with someone you love...

33:03.470 --> 33:05.603
And who loves you back.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.956
It is possible, isn't it?

33:23.905 --> 33:25.705
It is.

34:39.081 --> 34:41.270
- You've seen them?
- They're right around the bend.

34:41.295 --> 34:44.456
80, maybe 100 headed this way.

34:47.255 --> 34:49.089
If we're lucky and
it's on the lighter end,

34:49.114 --> 34:51.091
we might actually be
able to hold them off.

34:51.193 --> 34:55.061
"If we're lucky" is not a notion
that's worked well for us recently.

34:55.163 --> 34:57.163
You have men positioned by
the south and west gates?

34:57.188 --> 35:00.198
As many as we could
afford, which isn't many.

35:22.657 --> 35:24.224
What's happening out there?

35:24.326 --> 35:26.226
I don't know what chance you'll have.

35:26.251 --> 35:28.418
Their soldiers are likely everywhere.

35:30.065 --> 35:31.464
If you're going to be found by them,

35:31.489 --> 35:33.411
it shouldn't be tied up like an animal.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.681
You cannot stay here.

35:41.591 --> 35:42.966
Good luck.

36:05.343 --> 36:08.382
Need more men, Castro. Let's go!

36:09.413 --> 36:10.921
Reload!

36:14.215 --> 36:15.214
What is it?

36:16.498 --> 36:17.764
Reload!

36:20.885 --> 36:22.541
Can you hear that?

36:31.950 --> 36:34.294
- Come on, let's help them out.
- I'm out!

36:34.319 --> 36:36.919
How many men are watching the
south end of the cane fields?

36:36.944 --> 36:38.711
I think four.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.490
They're coming!

37:02.796 --> 37:05.590
- Get off the wall!
- Get off the wall!

37:08.230 --> 37:10.106
Horses behind us!

37:10.131 --> 37:12.176
Take positions and go!

37:21.115 --> 37:23.475
The back! Get the back!

37:29.341 --> 37:31.084
Yah! Run for the...

37:31.710 --> 37:33.247
Watch your flank!

37:43.753 --> 37:45.167
Retreat!

37:45.370 --> 37:46.799
Retreat!

37:46.824 --> 37:49.152
Run! Run!

41:24.085 --> 41:25.628
Madi!

41:26.187 --> 41:27.511
Madi!

41:28.717 --> 41:30.097
Madi.

41:40.602 --> 41:41.995
Don't waste the shot!

42:02.819 --> 42:04.117
Watch out! Watch out!

42:04.142 --> 42:06.041
Keep it down. Move ahead.

42:11.402 --> 42:13.308
Aim at the horses!

42:19.175 --> 42:20.439
Torches!

42:24.945 --> 42:26.022
Aim for the torches!

42:26.047 --> 42:28.312
- Aim for the torches.
- Take him down!

42:40.577 --> 42:42.293
Open the doors!

43:54.268 --> 43:55.801
Hey.

44:07.778 --> 44:09.430
Was he...

44:14.120 --> 44:16.587
Is he with them, my husband?

44:20.360 --> 44:21.944
No.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.219
No, he isn't.

44:30.244 --> 44:32.250
I tried to save her.

44:32.531 --> 44:34.006
Madi.

44:35.443 --> 44:37.910
I tried to save her.

45:54.255 --> 45:56.659
Let's move him before
he starts stinking.

46:00.428 --> 46:02.138
How many?

46:02.685 --> 46:04.746
A hundred, give or take.

46:04.771 --> 46:06.092
Roughly half withdrew,

46:06.117 --> 46:08.888
but I imagine it was not
without intent to return,

46:09.342 --> 46:11.504
and with greater numbers.

46:17.278 --> 46:19.164
Where's Madi?

46:40.902 --> 46:44.470
We've got about 30 able-bodied
men left, plus Julius's men.

46:44.495 --> 46:45.895
We should be able to
defend the main gate

46:45.920 --> 46:48.440
and have men to spare to prevent
another move through the cane.

46:48.465 --> 46:50.976
- We can't.
- Can't? We just drove them off once.

46:51.001 --> 46:53.153
And it cost you half your number.

46:54.682 --> 46:58.528
Spanish regulars will not allow
themselves to be defeated by us.

46:59.086 --> 47:00.853
And when they return...

47:00.955 --> 47:03.910
with three times as many reinforcements,

47:03.957 --> 47:06.325
what do you imagine will follow there?

47:06.427 --> 47:08.460
We know they're coming
now. We'll be ready.

47:08.485 --> 47:10.318
It's over.

47:13.659 --> 47:15.217
It's over.

47:22.710 --> 47:25.244
Gather whatever supplies you can.

47:25.629 --> 47:28.903
Anyone who can't make it to
the beach, I want them carried.

47:29.044 --> 47:31.411
I'll not leave anyone behind.

47:46.261 --> 47:47.947
We've done most of what we can

47:47.972 --> 47:50.516
and still be able to depart quickly,

47:50.705 --> 47:52.681
which we may have to do sooner or later

47:52.706 --> 47:55.131
with or without survivors.

47:55.209 --> 47:59.111
We have to assume the Spanish have
men all across the island by now.

47:59.213 --> 48:03.349
Every hour we sit here is an hour
closer to being sighted by them...

48:03.536 --> 48:06.043
if we haven't been sighted already.

48:11.856 --> 48:13.735
She saw Anne?

48:18.625 --> 48:22.037
We'll give them another
hour, then we'll set sail.

48:36.453 --> 48:40.877
Seems a fair amount of
resentment towards you these days.

48:48.037 --> 48:50.006
I just want you to know...

48:50.031 --> 48:52.451
that I remember what you did for me.

48:53.174 --> 48:55.841
Standing up to Captain Berringer.

48:57.905 --> 49:01.529
Jack can be angry. Anne can be angry.

49:01.809 --> 49:03.123
But...

49:04.859 --> 49:09.014
but I remember the
good you've done, too.

49:14.689 --> 49:17.423
It wasn't supposed to end like this.

49:22.768 --> 49:24.702
How can we all have sacrificed so much

49:24.726 --> 49:27.326
and none of us has
anything to show for it?

49:39.380 --> 49:42.514
Captain! Movement on the shoreline!

49:50.558 --> 49:52.165
I can't see anything.

49:53.060 --> 49:55.294
- Get those launches away.
- Aye.

49:55.396 --> 49:57.162
- Is Flint among them?
- I think so.

49:57.187 --> 49:58.754
By the dunes.

50:04.306 --> 50:06.974
Jesus, it looks like
they've been through hell.

50:09.410 --> 50:11.643
It will take some time
before we fully know

50:11.668 --> 50:13.968
all we have lost today.

51:30.891 --> 51:33.071
So, we are leaving?

51:35.596 --> 51:39.023
We, uh, follow Flint south...

51:39.048 --> 51:40.523
to the camp.

51:40.601 --> 51:42.687
We'll regroup,

51:42.712 --> 51:45.161
we'll refit, we'll...

52:08.562 --> 52:12.397
A war against civilization?

52:13.100 --> 52:14.666
What?

52:15.402 --> 52:19.638
Civilization has been winning
that war for 10,000 years

52:19.663 --> 52:24.554
against men richer, braver,
stronger, and smarter than you.

52:24.601 --> 52:26.645
How can you be so blind not to see that?

52:26.670 --> 52:28.290
What the fuck are you talking about?

52:28.315 --> 52:31.750
You mustered a force stronger
than you had any right to hope for.

52:31.775 --> 52:33.886
You hit the governor when
he was at his weakest.

52:33.911 --> 52:35.777
And at what result?

52:35.802 --> 52:39.158
Eleanor is dead, Anne is nearly dead,

52:39.183 --> 52:43.644
and the governor is sitting in
Nassau in my fucking chair victorious!

52:44.965 --> 52:48.605
You cannot fight civilization
from the outside in.

52:48.769 --> 52:51.737
And your plan now is to follow
that man into more of the same?!

52:51.839 --> 52:53.038
"What result?"

52:53.140 --> 52:57.109
That result was because
of your goddamn betrayal!

52:57.354 --> 53:00.743
Just now, that man and
several others wondered aloud

53:00.768 --> 53:02.068
whether the smartest thing to do

53:02.093 --> 53:04.727
wouldn't be killing you
and throwing you in the sea

53:04.752 --> 53:07.434
rather than giving you
another opportunity to fuck us!

53:07.459 --> 53:09.932
For reasons I can't begin to
fathom, I argued against it.

53:09.957 --> 53:13.959
Bark at me again about braver,
stronger, and smarter men,

53:13.984 --> 53:15.779
and I might decide to revisit the issue!

53:15.804 --> 53:17.686
If killing me seems like
the smartest thing to do,

53:17.711 --> 53:20.069
then it is obvious to me
none of you have any idea

53:20.094 --> 53:21.844
how to defeat Woodes Rogers.

53:21.869 --> 53:25.006
- And you do?!
- You're goddamn right, I do!

53:26.740 --> 53:28.654
Eleanor is dead,

53:29.045 --> 53:30.227
Anne is nearly dead,

53:30.252 --> 53:34.047
and I want him to pay
for all of it dearly.

53:35.749 --> 53:38.821
Do you want to help me or not?

53:45.426 --> 53:47.370
When Flint heads south,

53:47.395 --> 53:49.691
we head north.

53:52.484 --> 53:54.076
What's north?

53:54.644 --> 53:57.591
Eleanor Guthrie's grandfather.

54:27.401 --> 54:29.268
We'll be arriving soon.

54:33.741 --> 54:35.741
Still no sign of Rackham?

54:35.874 --> 54:37.440
No.

54:42.486 --> 54:45.514
Do you really think they just...

54:45.797 --> 54:47.697
Abandoned us?

54:49.023 --> 54:50.589
Yes.

55:08.865 --> 55:10.965
I'm sorry.

55:31.647 --> 55:33.814
I need you to know...

55:34.749 --> 55:36.929
that I did everything I could

55:36.954 --> 55:39.120
to keep her safe.

55:41.349 --> 55:42.816
I...

55:44.013 --> 55:46.574
I don't expect that to mean anything.

55:51.186 --> 55:53.103
It wasn't...

55:56.090 --> 55:58.056
your fault.

56:03.380 --> 56:06.815
It wasn't your fault.

57:55.258 --> 57:56.908
They had already begun to arrive

57:56.933 --> 58:00.188
when Kofi came with your
request for the cache.

58:00.515 --> 58:03.219
You can understand why
I didn't let him go.

58:04.485 --> 58:06.639
They came from other islands,

58:06.664 --> 58:08.386
the colonies,

58:08.449 --> 58:11.149
maroons from camps like this one,

58:11.174 --> 58:14.280
pirates from as far
away as Massachusetts.

58:14.628 --> 58:17.329
They heard that Nassau had fallen...

58:17.354 --> 58:19.349
and they came to join us.

58:22.053 --> 58:24.217
The revolution you promised...

58:24.287 --> 58:26.232
has begun!
