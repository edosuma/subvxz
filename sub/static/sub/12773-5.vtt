this bounty than
when we first got back

00:05.602 --> 00:07.135
from our honeymoon.

00:07.170 --> 00:08.971
I want to put an end to this
once and for all.

00:09.005 --> 00:11.974

behind this bounty first.

00:13.142 --> 00:15.010
Your agent knew
who the beast was,

too. Come on!

DOCTOR: If he lays low

00:28.224 --> 00:29.591
and makes a passing attempt
at being

he'll recover fully.

I'm fine. Now, look,

02:09.058 --> 02:10.459
she may have knocked
you clean out,

02:10.493 --> 02:12.527
but I will rip your
stinking heart out.

02:12.562 --> 02:14.429
So, last chance.
Who sent you?

02:14.464 --> 02:15.964
CATHERINE: Why does
whoever hired you want

02:15.999 --> 02:17.866
to have Vincent dead now
instead of just captured?

02:17.900 --> 02:19.468
I don't know what
you're talking about.

02:19.502 --> 02:22.804
(frustrated groan, yells)

02:22.839 --> 02:25.374
Why did you do that?
You heard him, right?

02:25.408 --> 02:27.409
He doesn't know, okay?
His heartbeat's steady.

02:27.443 --> 02:30.045
He's telling the truth.
We're wasting our freaking time.

02:30.079 --> 02:31.613
He is a lead,

02:31.648 --> 02:33.649
our only chance to get
ahead of this-- otherwise,

02:33.683 --> 02:36.752
this is our new
normal, Vincent.

02:36.786 --> 02:38.754
Okay, look, just, why
don't you just sit down?

02:38.788 --> 02:40.222
Dr. Heidari said you
shouldn't even be out of bed.

02:40.256 --> 02:42.457
Yeah, well,
Dr. Heidari doesn't know

02:42.492 --> 02:44.126
how dangerous it is for me to be
in bed these days, does he?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.428
Still, I need to get
you back to the hospital.

02:46.462 --> 02:47.999
I'm gonna bring him
in for questioning.

02:48.023 --> 02:49.131
No.

02:49.132 --> 02:50.565
(panting):
No, this is my...

02:50.600 --> 02:52.434
my problem... not yours.

02:52.468 --> 02:53.802
<i>Your</i> problem?
Yes. The hit man

02:53.836 --> 02:55.570
is after me, he's not after you.

02:55.605 --> 02:58.473
Try telling that
to my pillow.

03:00.176 --> 03:02.411

03:02.445 --> 03:03.979
You want to know
what's going on?

03:04.013 --> 03:05.781
I'm sick to death of this crap.

03:05.815 --> 03:07.983
You know what, I'm sick
of ducking beasts and bullets

03:08.017 --> 03:09.518
and every other person
that is after me, okay?

03:09.552 --> 03:11.853
And I'm sick of ruining
your life in the process.

03:11.888 --> 03:13.755
You are not ruining my life.

03:13.790 --> 03:15.590
There is a hit man
lying in the middle

03:15.625 --> 03:16.992
of your living room <i>again.</i>

03:17.026 --> 03:18.326
Just admit it,
you would've been

03:18.361 --> 03:20.629
better off
if you'd never found me.

03:20.663 --> 03:22.664
Okay, you're feverish.
I am calling the doctor.

03:22.699 --> 03:24.299
How many times have you been
shot at because of me, huh?

03:24.333 --> 03:25.834
How many times
have you been attacked

03:25.868 --> 03:27.936
or kidnapped? Yeah, how many
times you been kidnapped?

03:27.970 --> 03:30.505
What, ten, 20 times?
Just admit it, you would be

03:30.540 --> 03:32.641
better off without me.
I just

03:32.675 --> 03:34.710
got a group text message
from you.

03:34.744 --> 03:36.278
What?
Yeah, it went to JT

03:36.312 --> 03:37.546
and Tess, also.

03:37.580 --> 03:40.048
"911-- meet at café now."

03:41.384 --> 03:44.720
It's a trap.
They think I'm dead.

03:44.754 --> 03:46.769
They're going after all of us.
I got to go stop this.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.323
Vincent, you can't.

03:48.324 --> 03:50.025
(quietly):
Damn it.

03:53.229 --> 03:54.830
(horns honking in the distance)

04:00.203 --> 04:03.472
Cat and Vincent aren't here yet?

04:03.506 --> 04:06.041
Nope. Just me. Coffee?

04:06.075 --> 04:08.210
Thank you.

04:08.244 --> 04:09.845
They live right
around the corner.

04:09.879 --> 04:12.347
Why wouldn't they be here
by now if it was so urgent?

04:12.381 --> 04:14.549
I don't know, but whatever
it is, it can't be good.

04:14.584 --> 04:15.945
Hope Vincent's okay.

04:15.969 --> 04:17.552
I hope we're all okay.
This is weird.

04:17.553 --> 04:20.721
Meeting here at 3:00 a.m.?
What the hell could it be about?

04:20.757 --> 04:22.424
Maybe they just want
to get us alone,

04:22.458 --> 04:24.493
to kiss and make up. (chuckles)
Okay.

04:24.527 --> 04:26.495
Come on, relax.

04:26.529 --> 04:28.330
I'm just joking.

04:28.364 --> 04:31.733
Sheesh! At least you had a sense
of humor when we were together.

04:31.768 --> 04:33.902
Really? You think
you gave me a sense of humor?

04:33.936 --> 04:37.439
Yeah, I do, as a matter
of fact. And gummy worms.

04:37.473 --> 04:39.441
Got you into gummy worms.
That-that changed my life.

04:39.475 --> 04:40.675
You're right. You're right.
See?

04:40.710 --> 04:42.277
Yeah.
Just made you laugh.

04:42.311 --> 04:43.578
(phone ringing)

04:43.613 --> 04:45.680
Cat, where are you?

04:45.715 --> 04:46.948
Are you at Il Cantuccio?

04:46.983 --> 04:48.049
Yes, waiting for you
with JT. Why?

04:48.084 --> 04:49.684
No time to explain.

04:49.719 --> 04:50.752
Somebody hacked Vincent's phone.
It's a trap.

04:50.787 --> 04:51.920
You got to get out of there.

04:51.954 --> 04:52.854
What do you mean it's a trap?

04:52.889 --> 04:54.456
What are you talking about?

04:55.925 --> 04:58.360
Get down!

Let's go! Come on!

05:31.661 --> 05:35.163
(Vincent groaning)

05:35.198 --> 05:38.300
What the hell is going on?!
They're trying to kill Vincent.

05:38.334 --> 05:40.168
They're trying to kill all
of us. Where's Heather?

05:40.203 --> 05:42.137
She's out of town. She's
safe. He's burning up.

05:42.171 --> 05:45.640
Oh. It's sepsis.
He needs antibiotics.

05:45.675 --> 05:47.976
(Vincent growls,
Catherine gasps)

05:48.010 --> 05:49.911
(pants, gasps)

05:49.946 --> 05:51.913
I think he's fuguing
like the old days.

05:51.948 --> 05:54.583
He can't control it.

05:54.617 --> 05:57.152
Go!
(groaning)

05:57.186 --> 05:59.754
(glass clinking)

05:59.789 --> 06:02.791
(gun chamber cocks)

06:02.825 --> 06:04.693
We need to get him to a hospital.
Even if we could,

06:04.727 --> 06:07.762
do you really think we can
keep him from beasting out?

06:07.797 --> 06:09.331
'Cause, if you can't, he'll be exposed.
Either way, he'll be exposed.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.701
Half the block's called 911
by now. SWAT'll be

06:12.735 --> 06:14.603
on their way, they'll see him.
(growling)

06:14.637 --> 06:17.005
(groaning and gasping)

06:17.039 --> 06:18.673
Your apartment is close. Is
Vincent's doctor's bag there?

06:18.708 --> 06:20.642
Yes.
He's probably got antibiotics.

06:20.676 --> 06:22.510
Can you give me cover fire?
Are you out of your mind?

06:22.545 --> 06:24.112
You have a better idea?!

06:24.146 --> 06:26.848
Hurry! Go! Now!

06:26.883 --> 06:29.718
Go! Go! Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!

06:32.355 --> 06:33.655
(breathing loud,
gasping breaths)

06:33.689 --> 06:36.625
Vincent.

06:36.659 --> 06:38.293
Vincent, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

06:38.327 --> 06:40.495
(wheezing)

06:40.529 --> 06:43.665
(distorted):
I love you. I love you.

06:43.699 --> 06:45.367
Vincent, stay with me!

06:45.401 --> 06:49.838
JT:
<i>Vincent! Vincent?!</i>

06:49.872 --> 06:52.707
Vincent! Oh, we got
to get you out of here

06:52.742 --> 06:55.143
before someone sees
what you did.

06:55.177 --> 06:57.579
Come on! Come on!
(Vincent panting)

06:57.613 --> 06:59.547
It's okay. It's okay.

06:59.582 --> 07:01.383
I know you didn't mean
to beast out, okay.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.485
You don't have control. But we
got to go before the zoo opens.

07:03.519 --> 07:05.720

07:14.530 --> 07:16.665
Oh.

07:16.699 --> 07:18.667

07:18.701 --> 07:20.769
This isn't happening.
(distant growl of animal)

07:20.803 --> 07:23.338
This isn't happening.
You're fuguing,

07:23.372 --> 07:25.273

getting worse. Come on.

Fugue states, Muirfield--

08:16.993 --> 08:18.527
Great, now you're forgetting
an entire decade.

08:18.561 --> 08:21.129
Better hurry up
and find a cure.

08:21.164 --> 08:23.131
Cure for what?

08:23.166 --> 08:25.634
For beasting out.

08:25.668 --> 08:27.302
You forget that, too?

08:27.336 --> 08:30.472
Oh, you stopped looking
for the cure, JT, you gave up.

08:30.506 --> 08:32.274
No way. I'm
never giving up.

08:32.308 --> 08:34.109
We can't keep living like
this for another ten years.

08:34.143 --> 08:37.011
But we're not! We don't.

08:38.815 --> 08:41.116
Okay, I got to...
got to work this out.

08:41.150 --> 08:42.551

08:42.585 --> 08:46.488
Get yourself together, okay?

08:46.522 --> 08:49.024
Okay, think things through,
okay?

08:49.058 --> 08:51.626
All right, Catherine
and I were shot at, and I...

08:51.661 --> 08:53.528
I lost my cool,
and I said things

08:53.563 --> 08:55.130
that I shouldn't have
to her, and...

08:55.164 --> 08:56.531
there was a text, right?
There was a text.

08:56.566 --> 08:58.567
There was a text,
it went to everyone.

08:58.601 --> 09:00.469
It went to you,
it went to Tess.

09:00.503 --> 09:01.870
Tess. Who's Tess?

09:01.904 --> 09:04.139
Il Cantuccio. That's it.

09:04.173 --> 09:07.642
I was at Il Cantuccio, and
I got... I got into a fight.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.411
I got into a fight,
and then I got hit

09:09.445 --> 09:11.680
in the stomach
where I was shot, right?

09:15.885 --> 09:19.321
No. That's-that's impossible.
Vincent?

09:19.355 --> 09:20.689
Vincent, buddy.
It's impossible.

09:20.723 --> 09:22.157
Listen to me.
No.

09:22.191 --> 09:24.092
You need to get some rest.
No.

09:24.127 --> 09:26.495
You need to stay in control.
If you keep beasting out

09:26.529 --> 09:28.497
in public like that, they'll find you.
I don't need to relax, JT.

09:28.531 --> 09:30.599
I don't need to relax.
I got to find out

09:30.633 --> 09:32.701
what the hell is going on.
I need to find Catherine.

09:32.735 --> 09:35.003
Wait. Where are you going?

09:35.037 --> 09:36.538
Who's Catherine?

09:36.572 --> 09:39.741
Oh, sorry.

09:39.775 --> 09:41.710
Oh, hey, hey,
watch where you're going.

09:41.744 --> 09:46.114
Where are you?
Where are you?

09:51.220 --> 09:53.021
I can't tell you how glad I
am to see you. I don't know

09:53.055 --> 09:55.090
what's going on. I must've
bumped my head or something.

09:55.124 --> 09:57.092
Who are you?

09:57.126 --> 10:00.428
Who am I? Come on.
You're joking me, right?

10:03.799 --> 10:07.235
Okay, I don't know what's
going on-- something strange--

10:07.270 --> 10:09.790
but if we just stick together,
everything will be fine.

10:09.814 --> 10:10.605
I'm sorry.

10:10.606 --> 10:13.041
I think you're mistaking me
for somebody else. Excuse me.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.709
Wait. Where are you going?
Hey, sorry I'm late.

10:14.744 --> 10:16.678
Tess! Hey.
Whoa.

10:17.647 --> 10:19.714
Do I know you?

10:19.749 --> 10:23.151
Really? Of course you know me.
Okay.

10:23.186 --> 10:25.520
Come on,
we're back here.

10:27.523 --> 10:28.924
Who is that?

10:28.958 --> 10:32.127
I have no idea.
Weirdo.

10:32.161 --> 10:34.596
(cheering
and applause)

10:39.268 --> 10:41.937
Did you do this?

10:41.971 --> 10:43.071
Yeah, me and Evan.

10:43.105 --> 10:44.739
Evan.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.309
Surprise again.

10:47.343 --> 10:48.643
Oh.

10:48.678 --> 10:49.945
Happy anniversary, my darling.

10:49.979 --> 10:50.946
Oh, thank you.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.480
This isn't happening.

10:52.515 --> 10:54.449
Congrats, guys!
(whooping)

10:54.483 --> 10:56.751
What the hell is going on?!

10:56.786 --> 10:57.819
I know!

10:57.853 --> 10:58.920
Unbelievable!

10:58.955 --> 11:00.455
Bad call, ref!

11:00.489 --> 11:01.590
TESS:
Excuse me,

11:01.624 --> 11:03.792
guys, this is a private party.

11:03.826 --> 11:05.660
You need to move it along.
Right.

11:05.695 --> 11:09.331
Uh, sorry, Officer.
Um, moving along. Come on.

11:09.365 --> 11:10.765
Let's go.
What's the matter with you?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.668
Beasting out I can handle.
Crazy, I can't.

11:13.703 --> 11:16.137
EVAN: Okay, that was weird.
Back to the celebrations.

11:16.172 --> 11:17.872
To my beautiful wife,

11:17.907 --> 11:19.975
on the eve of our second anniversary,
No.

11:20.009 --> 11:21.343
that I pledge,

11:21.377 --> 11:22.711
in front of all our family
and friends,

11:22.745 --> 11:24.879
that I will continue to strive

11:24.914 --> 11:26.715
to be the perfect husband,

11:26.749 --> 11:28.483
your best friend,

11:28.517 --> 11:30.185
and your happily ever after.

11:30.219 --> 11:31.987
This isn't happening.

11:32.021 --> 11:33.788
I love you, Catherine Marks.
This isn't happening.

11:33.823 --> 11:34.889
I love you, too.

11:34.924 --> 11:35.991
He's dead. He's dead.

11:36.025 --> 11:37.058
Hey, he's dead!

11:37.093 --> 11:38.493
JT:
Okay, we're going. Bye.

11:38.527 --> 11:39.928
Sorry. Sorry.
He's dead. He's dead.

11:41.731 --> 11:44.065
Are you out of your mind?

11:44.100 --> 11:45.567
Muirfield is everywhere.

11:45.601 --> 11:47.168
You have to be more careful.

11:47.203 --> 11:49.638
JT, Muirfield doesn't
exist anymore, okay?

11:49.672 --> 11:52.807
We destroyed them over three years ago,
after they killed Evan,

11:52.842 --> 11:54.542
which means he can't
possibly still be alive,

11:54.577 --> 11:56.211
let alone married to Catherine!

11:56.245 --> 11:57.512
I don't get
it, man.

11:57.546 --> 11:59.748
How could she
not even recognize me?!

11:59.782 --> 12:02.851
This is crazy. It's got to be
a dream. It's got to be a dream.

12:02.885 --> 12:04.552
Or I'm feverish or something.
Because this is not real.

12:04.587 --> 12:07.822
This is not real. Vincent,
this is not... Ow! Damn it!

12:07.857 --> 12:10.191
That feel real enough to you?!

12:10.226 --> 12:14.195
Pull it together. I get it.
You had a nasty fugue,

12:14.230 --> 12:15.830
but I've spent the last
12 years of my life trying

12:15.865 --> 12:18.400
to keep you alive, and I'm not
gonna let it go down the drain

12:18.434 --> 12:20.404
just because you woke up
on the wrong side of the cage.

12:20.405 --> 12:24.040
JT, you don't live like this in the
real world, okay? None of us do!

12:24.073 --> 12:26.408
And you don't feel guilty
about volunteering me

12:26.442 --> 12:28.576
for the super soldier program
anymore, okay?

12:28.611 --> 12:31.846
I forgave you! Years ago!

12:31.881 --> 12:34.716
How'd you know about that?

12:44.727 --> 12:47.262
EVAN: Who was that guy?
He seemed to know you. Did he?

12:47.296 --> 12:48.863
I don't know. I've never seen
him before in my life. What,

12:48.898 --> 12:50.598
are you jealous?
No, I'm upset, all right?

12:50.633 --> 12:51.633
I tried to surprise you

12:51.667 --> 12:53.068
with a nice
anniversary party.

12:53.102 --> 12:54.431
CATHERINE: Yeah, you surprised me,
all right.

12:54.432 --> 12:55.872
EVAN: It obviously
didn't please you.

12:56.672 --> 12:58.189
I don't want to talk about
this right now, Evan, it's late.

12:58.213 --> 12:59.174
Well, I do.

12:59.175 --> 13:02.944
Look... Cat, just
talk to me, okay?

13:02.978 --> 13:04.946
Tell me
what's wrong.

13:04.980 --> 13:07.315
I love you more than anything,
and you know that.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.121
I would die for you.

13:13.155 --> 13:14.956
(sighs)

13:14.990 --> 13:16.991
Just... just tell me what to do.

13:17.026 --> 13:19.894
Tell me how to make you happy.
I don't know.

13:19.929 --> 13:21.896
All I know is
that this isn't about you.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.766
You are a good man,
Evan.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.968
You have only
ever been good to me.

13:27.002 --> 13:29.137
But...

13:29.171 --> 13:31.139
But what?

13:31.173 --> 13:34.576
I keep trying to find ways

13:34.610 --> 13:37.612
to make this work... for us.

13:37.646 --> 13:40.448
But no matter
how hard I try,

13:40.483 --> 13:42.450
I...
(chuckles)

13:42.485 --> 13:45.854
I can't get past...

13:45.888 --> 13:47.389
What, that night?

13:48.691 --> 13:51.151
Damn it, Cat,
still?

13:51.152 --> 13:53.696
I can't forget it
just because you want me to.

13:53.729 --> 13:56.965
My mother was murdered
that night,

13:56.999 --> 13:57.911
and I was supposed
to be killed, too.

13:57.912 --> 14:00.336
Yeah, but some fairy tale
creature saved you.

14:00.369 --> 14:03.772
Look, it was ten years ago, Cat,
okay? It's time to get over it.

14:03.806 --> 14:05.640
A terrible thing
happened,

14:05.674 --> 14:07.308
beyond awful, but...

14:07.343 --> 14:09.711
this fantasy version
that you have made up

14:09.745 --> 14:12.480
is just destroying us.
Can't you see that?

14:12.515 --> 14:16.084
Nobody believes me.
Nobody ever has.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.825
(door closes)

14:31.000 --> 14:33.401
(horn honks, siren blaring)

14:42.611 --> 14:45.380
Okay, don't be scared.

14:45.414 --> 14:48.183
It's okay. It's me.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.187
I'm a cop.

14:52.221 --> 14:54.022
A detective, actually.

14:54.056 --> 14:57.225
Although you're really supposed
to be a Homeland Security agent.

14:58.694 --> 15:00.595
Listen,
I'm-I'm not gonna hurt you,

15:00.629 --> 15:01.996
okay? I
just...

15:02.031 --> 15:04.399
I really need your help
right now.

15:04.433 --> 15:05.366
For what?

15:05.401 --> 15:07.368
For...

15:07.403 --> 15:09.370
(sighs)
I don't know, you know?

15:09.405 --> 15:12.106
You're-you're the only one
who can save me.

15:12.141 --> 15:13.608
Okay...

15:15.244 --> 15:17.879
Look, I-I know this is crazy,
Catherine...

15:17.913 --> 15:18.913
How do you know my name?

15:21.383 --> 15:23.685
I know everything about you.

15:23.719 --> 15:27.589
Your best friend's Tess. You
were born on September the 4th.

15:27.623 --> 15:29.023
You kickbox. You drink Bordeaux.

15:29.058 --> 15:32.060
You love...
you love old movies.

15:34.163 --> 15:37.165
I know that your mother's death
wasn't your fault.

15:39.168 --> 15:42.437
I don't know why you don't
remember me, I really don't.

15:42.471 --> 15:44.973
I don't know why you don't
remember that you already have

15:45.007 --> 15:47.475
the answers that you're looking
for, but I do now that together,

15:47.510 --> 15:49.944
we can work this out,
we can figure this out,

15:49.979 --> 15:53.648
so somehow I can wake up
from this living hell! Please.

15:56.852 --> 15:58.286
(grunts)
(yells)

15:58.320 --> 16:00.722
(thudding)
Maybe that'll wake you up!

16:00.756 --> 16:02.991
Catherine, no! Wait!

16:03.025 --> 16:05.393
(growling, gasping)

16:05.427 --> 16:07.495
Go, JT! Go!

16:09.665 --> 16:11.065
Good thing
you live close.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.101
I wish the precinct
was closer. Any ETA?

16:13.135 --> 16:15.503
Five minutes, maybe less. I've
only got three rounds left, you?

16:15.538 --> 16:18.973
Two.

16:19.008 --> 16:20.608
An IV? Really? Couldn't you
just give him a shot?

16:20.643 --> 16:22.577
He's way past that.

16:22.611 --> 16:24.812
(growling)
A little help here!

16:24.847 --> 16:29.117
Vincent, Vincent,
okay. It's okay.

16:29.151 --> 16:30.752
He all right?
Yeah.

16:30.786 --> 16:33.354
We're running out of time.

16:33.389 --> 16:36.124
You think?
(Vincent panting loudly)

16:43.018 --> 16:46.503
Shh, shh, it's okay. I love you.
Just hang in there, okay?

16:46.504 --> 16:48.172
You don't even know me.
Vincent, just

16:48.206 --> 16:50.374
keep on fighting, okay? Just
don't give up on me, all right?

16:50.408 --> 16:52.743
You know me.

16:52.777 --> 16:55.813
Please, please help me.
(gunshots, glass breaking)

16:55.847 --> 16:58.215
(gasps)

16:58.250 --> 17:00.651
JT:
Vincent? Vincent, listen to me.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.820
VINCENT: <i>How could she not even</i>
<i>know who I am?</i>

17:02.854 --> 17:04.888
Calm down, okay? You
can't keep beasting out.

17:04.923 --> 17:08.157
Might as well hang a sign that
says: Dear Muirfield, here I am!

17:08.193 --> 17:10.160
No, no, that's it.
That's it.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.162
I told her that she was
better off without me.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.231
That's what this is all about.
It's got to be.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.667
I'm sorry, okay? I take it back!
I didn't mean it!

17:17.702 --> 17:20.905
You're not seeing
her now, are you?

17:20.939 --> 17:22.873
No, JT, okay,
I'm not crazy.

17:22.907 --> 17:24.375
Could have fooled me.

17:24.409 --> 17:26.109
(train horn blowing)
Oh!

17:26.144 --> 17:29.680
Whatever the hell is going
on, all I know is that

17:29.714 --> 17:31.248
it begins with Catherine,

17:31.283 --> 17:33.517
and it sure as hell is
gonna end with Catherine.

17:33.551 --> 17:37.388
Still, how do you
even know her?

17:37.422 --> 17:39.690
Okay, listen.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.692
Four years ago,
give or take,

17:41.726 --> 17:44.261
a cop came looking for me.
You remember? A detective?

17:44.296 --> 17:46.363
Yeah.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.032
Wait. That was her?

17:48.066 --> 17:50.067
Yes! Although in the real world,
we fell in love,

17:50.101 --> 17:52.069
and we've been together
ever since.

17:52.103 --> 17:54.138
I mean, for God's sake,
we're married now!

17:54.172 --> 17:55.940
Right, and I'm married
to Katy Perry.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.809
Okay, come on, man, please,
you-you got to believe me.

17:58.843 --> 18:01.211
Okay, please trust
me on this one.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.481
Okay, you didn't know
that I knew

18:04.516 --> 18:07.484
that you volunteered me for the
super soldier program, right?

18:07.519 --> 18:09.119
But I did, I do.

18:09.154 --> 18:12.089
I mean, maybe not in this crazy,
mixed-up world,

18:12.123 --> 18:13.424
but in the real world.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.225
I mean, even though

18:15.260 --> 18:16.961
the real world's not a hell
of a lot better than here.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.262
Someone's trying
to kill me there.

18:18.296 --> 18:19.964
Someone's trying
to kill you here.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.666
Yes, but we don't
live like this, okay?

18:22.701 --> 18:24.501
We're not running
from Muirfield,

18:24.536 --> 18:26.170
you're not trying to stop me
from beasting out anymore.

18:26.204 --> 18:28.172
I mean, as screwed up as it is,
it's better there, man.

18:28.206 --> 18:30.174
I mean, believe me,
you got to believe me!

18:30.208 --> 18:32.176
It is better there.

18:32.210 --> 18:34.912
Okay.

18:34.946 --> 18:36.313
Okay.
I'll try anything

18:36.348 --> 18:37.748
at this point if it'll help.

18:37.782 --> 18:39.149
We're running out of time.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.185
I know, I know.

18:41.219 --> 18:43.721
So, how do we convince
this Catherine person?

18:47.292 --> 18:48.826
(grunts)

18:48.860 --> 18:50.661
(panting)

18:50.695 --> 18:52.096
Who the hell are you?!

18:52.130 --> 18:54.365
Ah. It's nice to see you,
too, Reynolds.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.200
How do you know who I am?

18:56.234 --> 18:58.435
I know a lot of
things about you.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.770
I know you're
Catherine's father,

18:59.804 --> 19:01.305
I know you work
for Muirfield,

19:01.339 --> 19:02.806
and I know that you're
supposed to be dead.

19:02.841 --> 19:05.309
Well, at least
in my world.

19:05.343 --> 19:07.183
What, are you threatening me?
I'm an FBI agent!

19:07.212 --> 19:08.550
Yeah, you want me
to shoot him?

19:08.574 --> 19:10.214
No.

19:10.215 --> 19:14.518
Tranq gun's for me...
in case I lose control.

19:17.188 --> 19:20.391
Who are you? And how do you know
I'm Catherine's father?

19:20.425 --> 19:21.992
She doesn't even know that.

19:22.027 --> 19:23.794
All that matters
is that I know,

19:23.828 --> 19:26.130
and I need you to
tell her for me.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.532
Why? Why would I hurt her?

19:28.566 --> 19:30.567
I promised her mother
I'd never tell her the truth.

19:30.602 --> 19:32.536
Well, it's not like you
haven't broken promises before,

19:32.570 --> 19:35.372
is it, Reynolds?

19:35.407 --> 19:36.807
You tell her,
so she can believe

19:36.841 --> 19:38.542
what I have to say
and she can help me.

19:38.576 --> 19:40.210
Help you do what?

19:40.245 --> 19:42.046
Help me make sense
of all this, okay?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.415
Help me get home so I can
make things right for her.

19:44.449 --> 19:47.551
Like it or not, your
daughter-- she needs me.

19:47.585 --> 19:49.086
And I certainly need her.
I'll tell you what.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.822
You can do whatever
you want to me,

19:51.856 --> 19:54.358
but I'm not gonna
help you hurt my daughter.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.261
(growling)

19:57.295 --> 19:59.163
Vincent!
(growling)

19:59.197 --> 20:04.001
Oh, my God, you're one
of them, aren't you?

20:04.035 --> 20:06.070
I thought Muirfield
eliminated all of you.

20:06.104 --> 20:09.339
Not all of them.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.608
You-you all right, big guy?

20:11.643 --> 20:13.677
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

20:13.711 --> 20:16.580
Let's go.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.451
(computer chirping)

20:26.891 --> 20:29.927
So, Joe stood me up
last night again.

20:29.961 --> 20:32.296
Really sucks
when you're involved

20:32.330 --> 20:34.031
with your married boss,
you know?

20:34.065 --> 20:35.866
Tess, I keep telling you,
there is somebody out there

20:35.900 --> 20:37.301
who is better for you.

20:37.335 --> 20:40.237
Really? Like who?

20:40.271 --> 20:42.206
Isn't that the guy
who crashed your party?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.774
Yeah, and his friend.

20:43.808 --> 20:45.476
And you're trying to figure out
who he is, why?

20:45.510 --> 20:47.945
I don't know.
You don't know?

20:47.979 --> 20:52.049
You are just
gonna tease me.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.884
Listen to me.

20:53.918 --> 20:56.253
If you are thinking of having
an affair, please don't.

20:56.287 --> 20:57.654
It's not worth it.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.823
No, I am not thinking
about having an affair.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.792
I love Evan.
Mm-hmm.

21:01.826 --> 21:04.895
Look, I saw the plastic look
on your face last night.

21:04.929 --> 21:06.296
Just saying.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.932
Anyway...

21:08.967 --> 21:11.902
that, um... that guy-- he, uh...

21:11.936 --> 21:15.439
he came to see me again
last night... on the roof.

21:15.473 --> 21:17.274
He said he needed my help.

21:17.308 --> 21:19.776
And he seemed to know
an awful lot about me.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.745
That's really creepy.
What did you do?

21:21.779 --> 21:23.313
I hit him in the jaw... twice.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.149
But... the more

21:25.183 --> 21:27.518
that I thought about it
afterward, the more I...

21:27.552 --> 21:30.320
started to wonder
if maybe he knows something.

21:30.355 --> 21:32.089
About what?
About, um...

21:32.123 --> 21:34.358
that night.

21:34.392 --> 21:36.994
Oh, Cat, come on.
That's...

21:37.028 --> 21:38.795
Okay, never mind.
Forget I said anything.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.831
Seriously, what...
what are the chances

21:40.865 --> 21:42.432
that that guy knows
what happened that night?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.801
Especially
after all these years.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.004
I know, but if he
genuinely has answers,

21:47.038 --> 21:49.006
Tess, I need to
know what they are.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.641
Besides, why
would he say

21:50.675 --> 21:52.809
this wasn't my fault if
he didn't know something?

21:52.844 --> 21:55.846
I don't... I just feel like
you're grasping at straws.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.349
Maybe I am, but I bel...
I believe him.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.785
I don't know why, but...

22:01.819 --> 22:04.288
there's just something
about him.

22:04.322 --> 22:07.324
All right, why don't you go
back to the rooftop,

22:07.358 --> 22:10.194
dust for prints, try to run it
for DNA, something.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.329
I'll let you know if anything

22:12.363 --> 22:13.964
pops up on facial
recognition.

22:13.998 --> 22:15.465
You're gonna cover for me?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.834
Yes, but don't make
a habit of it, okay?

22:17.869 --> 22:20.037
Make a habit
of what?

22:20.071 --> 22:22.806
Evan. Well,
what are you doing here?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.708
I was wondering if

22:24.742 --> 22:25.909
I could take you
to lunch

22:25.944 --> 22:28.912
so we can, um, talk?

22:28.947 --> 22:30.380
Uh, she can't.

22:30.415 --> 22:32.549
She's on a case,
hot lead.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.151
You actually better go,
or you're gonna lose him.

22:34.185 --> 22:37.721
Rain check tonight?
Sure.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.396
Uh, coffee?

22:46.431 --> 22:48.398
No, I'm good.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.466
Okay.

22:53.271 --> 22:55.372
(computer chirping)

22:57.642 --> 23:00.043
Who the hell are you?

23:02.580 --> 23:05.916
I saw him myself--
Vincent Keller.

23:05.950 --> 23:07.551
It says in his file
that he was killed

23:07.585 --> 23:09.586
in the Spera District
with the rest of his troop.

23:10.157 --> 23:11.457
Well, he looked pretty good
for a dead guy.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.892
MAN:
What do you mean?

23:12.926 --> 23:14.593
Don't patronize me, okay?

23:14.628 --> 23:16.562
I know what Muirfield is.

23:16.596 --> 23:18.831
How do you think
I found you in the first place?

23:18.865 --> 23:20.566
Does that mean you're willing
to work with us, Dr. Marks?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.735
Finally put your cross-species
research to work?

23:22.769 --> 23:24.336
No, it doesn't.

23:24.371 --> 23:26.572
I just want to know-- is Keller
one or your experiments,

23:26.606 --> 23:27.973
or isn't he?

23:28.008 --> 23:31.510
We've been looking
for him, yes.

23:31.545 --> 23:33.012
Where did you last see him?

23:33.046 --> 23:34.814
Look, I don't want you
to hurt him, okay?

23:34.848 --> 23:37.616
I just want you
to keep him away from my wife.

23:37.651 --> 23:39.752
The only reason I called you was
to prove to her

23:39.786 --> 23:41.120
that creatures like him
don't really exist.

23:41.154 --> 23:43.289
And now you
know they do.

23:45.392 --> 23:47.927
I just don't want to lose her,
all right?

23:47.961 --> 23:50.362
Understood.
We'll take care of it.

23:52.465 --> 23:54.800
(phone beeps off)

23:54.835 --> 23:56.235
(computer chirps)

24:00.974 --> 24:02.808
(thuds)

24:02.843 --> 24:06.212
(sighs heavily)

24:06.246 --> 24:08.047
Why would Catherine
even believe me anyway?

24:08.081 --> 24:10.015
Because I believe she's
looking for answers, all right?

24:10.050 --> 24:12.651
The truth. You can tell her
how much you loved her mother

24:12.686 --> 24:15.387
but how she dropped your
deceitful ass when she found out

24:15.422 --> 24:17.456
you were militarizing her
experiments behind her back.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.325
How do you even know
these things?

24:19.359 --> 24:21.794
Look, Reynolds, I'm not gonna
hurt Catherine, okay?

24:21.828 --> 24:24.363
I love her very much,
and she loves me.

24:24.397 --> 24:25.798
Well, that's impossible.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.333
You're one of them.

24:27.367 --> 24:29.068
Well, at least
you're consistent.

24:29.102 --> 24:32.037
You hate the idea of us being
together in both worlds.

24:32.072 --> 24:34.373
What is it?
What's wrong?

24:34.407 --> 24:36.709
(Vincent gasps)

24:38.044 --> 24:39.578
(groans)

24:39.613 --> 24:41.113
Catherine.

24:42.616 --> 24:44.650
(shouting):
Catherine?!

24:44.684 --> 24:47.920
Okay, what happened?
What's wrong?

24:47.954 --> 24:49.288
What happened?
Shh!

24:51.391 --> 24:53.726
(exhales heavily)

24:55.695 --> 24:57.663
What's he doing?

24:57.697 --> 24:59.632
No idea.

25:02.769 --> 25:04.403
(indistinct chatter, groaning)

25:07.641 --> 25:10.242
(growling)

25:10.277 --> 25:12.077
Vincent, calm down!
(growling)

25:13.213 --> 25:15.614
(growling, gunshot)

25:15.649 --> 25:18.784
(growling, yelling,
breathing loudly)

25:18.818 --> 25:20.289
What's happening? Why aren't
the antibiotics working?

25:20.313 --> 25:21.086
I don't know.

25:21.087 --> 25:23.222
They should be, but he seems
to be getting worse.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.691
I'm out.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.127
(helicopter whirring)

25:30.931 --> 25:34.733
Here comes
the cavalry.

25:34.768 --> 25:37.369
Yeah, and exposure.
(sirens blaring)

25:37.404 --> 25:38.737
(loud panting)

25:44.663 --> 25:47.832
Don't give up, Vincent. Come on.
Come back to me, please.

25:47.866 --> 25:49.767
(panting)
Vincent.

25:49.802 --> 25:51.969
Vincent, wake up!
Vincent, please.

25:52.004 --> 25:55.139
Please don't give up.
I love you.

25:55.174 --> 25:57.175
<i>Keep on fighting, Vincent,</i>
<i>stay with me.</i>

25:57.209 --> 25:59.177
(groaning)

26:00.512 --> 26:01.251
Get out of the way.

26:01.275 --> 26:02.714
What, are you gonna
kill him now?!

26:02.715 --> 26:04.782
I'm not letting that thing
anywhere near my daughter.

26:04.817 --> 26:07.785
I should never have let it
get this far. He's a mistake.

26:07.820 --> 26:09.954
I am her only hope, all right?

26:09.988 --> 26:12.824
Muirfield has taken her.
I saw it all.

26:12.858 --> 26:15.226
You saw what?
JT, go to the bathroom.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.228
Get me something
to stop the bleeding, okay?

26:17.262 --> 26:19.664
Buddy, hurry.
I got to go track her now.

26:19.698 --> 26:21.699
Okay, go.
Hey!

26:23.869 --> 26:25.503
Let him go.

26:25.537 --> 26:27.338
Come on. For Catherine, please.

26:30.042 --> 26:32.577
(panting)

26:32.611 --> 26:34.979
We've always had one thing
in common, Reynolds.

26:35.013 --> 26:37.882
We both want
what's best for Catherine.

26:37.916 --> 26:40.551
But right now,
whether you like it or not,

26:40.586 --> 26:42.887
I am what is best for her.

26:44.456 --> 26:45.556
FBI!

26:45.591 --> 26:46.724
VINCENT:
Evan?

26:48.227 --> 26:50.695
You? Wait. Where's Cat?

26:50.729 --> 26:52.830
Muirfield took her. Catch up!
Lift your shirt.

26:52.865 --> 26:53.686
(Vincent grunts)

26:53.710 --> 26:54.966
They weren't supposed
to take her.

26:54.967 --> 26:58.102
How do you know that, huh?

26:58.137 --> 27:01.172
You did this, didn't you? Aah!
Oh, oh, easy, easy. Relax.

27:01.206 --> 27:02.840
Trying to protect
her from you!

27:02.875 --> 27:04.175
(panting)

27:04.209 --> 27:06.677
She didn't make you up, did she?

27:06.712 --> 27:09.213
You were there that
night. You saved her.

27:09.248 --> 27:11.849
Muirfield must have known
how much she meant to you.

27:11.884 --> 27:16.254
That's why they've taken
her to get to you.

27:16.288 --> 27:19.457
They're not gonna let her go,
even if they have Vincent.

27:19.491 --> 27:21.526
They don't leave loose ends.

27:21.560 --> 27:24.729
Wait. I think I might know
where they've taken her.

27:24.763 --> 27:27.598
It's an old-old power plant,
and it's high security.

27:27.633 --> 27:29.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
Show me.

27:29.635 --> 27:31.803
It will be a trap.
I know.

27:31.837 --> 27:33.771
I know. JT, we'll tell you
the location.

27:33.806 --> 27:35.873
You hack into the security
system, you disable it, okay?

27:35.908 --> 27:37.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'll do what?!

27:37.242 --> 27:38.976
Buddy, believe me.

27:39.011 --> 27:40.478
You've done it before,
you can do it again.

27:40.512 --> 27:42.313
The precinct's got
high-level access.

27:42.347 --> 27:44.816
Use the computers. Just
sweet-talk Catherine's partner.

27:44.850 --> 27:45.883
The hot detective?

27:45.918 --> 27:47.885
Yes. Her name's Tess.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.755
Reynolds will give you access,
right?

27:50.789 --> 27:52.590
I'm gonna what?

27:52.624 --> 27:54.826
Come on, man, for-for Catherine.

27:56.028 --> 27:59.063
Here, take this, too.

27:59.097 --> 28:00.898
You might need it.
JT: Still, why

28:00.933 --> 28:02.066
would Tess help me?

28:02.100 --> 28:03.501
Because her partner's
in trouble,

28:03.535 --> 28:05.903
and, buddy, you make
her life so good.

28:05.938 --> 28:08.005
Use gummy worms. Come on.

28:09.708 --> 28:12.810
(Vincent groans)

28:12.845 --> 28:15.046
Gummy worms?

28:18.951 --> 28:20.184
(groans)

28:20.219 --> 28:21.652
You really should
see a doctor.

28:21.687 --> 28:24.422
(chuckles):
I  <i>am</i> a doctor.

28:24.456 --> 28:27.058
That's a very long story.

28:29.494 --> 28:32.797
Cat never stopped believing
you existed, you know.

28:32.831 --> 28:34.665
Despite what
everyone else thought.

28:36.201 --> 28:37.869
I certainly didn't believe it.

28:37.903 --> 28:39.837
Maybe I just didn't want to.

28:39.872 --> 28:41.939
Drove a huge wedge between us.

28:41.974 --> 28:44.141
What do you want me to say?

28:44.176 --> 28:46.510
That you'll go away after this?

28:46.545 --> 28:48.479
Wouldn't matter if you did.

28:48.513 --> 28:50.815
Doesn't matter
how much I love her,

28:50.849 --> 28:52.817
which, for the record, I do,
completely.

28:52.851 --> 28:55.019
Cat doesn't love me.

28:55.053 --> 28:58.689
Not the way that I
love her, anyway.

28:58.724 --> 29:00.524
She's tried, I know she has,

29:00.559 --> 29:03.628
but it's like a part of her died
the night her mother did,

29:03.662 --> 29:06.030
and I just can't touch that.

29:07.232 --> 29:08.966
But maybe you can.

29:09.001 --> 29:10.635
Maybe you
can give her

29:10.669 --> 29:13.204
the answers that
she's looking for, heal her.

29:17.075 --> 29:19.911
You're a good man, Evan.

29:19.945 --> 29:22.747
I'm sorry I didn't get
to tell you that before.

29:22.781 --> 29:24.415
What are you talking about?
We just met.

29:31.123 --> 29:33.524
Hi. Tess?

29:33.558 --> 29:35.593
Yeah?

29:35.627 --> 29:39.063
I'm... you know, JT?

29:39.097 --> 29:40.665
So?

29:40.699 --> 29:43.000
Didn't Agent Reynolds...?

29:43.035 --> 29:45.336
Yeah, I know, he called,
but I still don't know

29:45.370 --> 29:47.505
what's going on
or who the hell you are.

29:47.539 --> 29:49.507
Look, both of our friends
are in trouble,

29:49.541 --> 29:52.076
which means we need
to work together.

29:52.110 --> 29:55.112
So... may I?

29:57.316 --> 30:00.084
Hurry up.

30:00.118 --> 30:02.053
Thanks.

30:04.456 --> 30:07.591
Okay. Sure hope
I know how to do this.

30:07.626 --> 30:09.727
(keyboard keys clicking)

30:11.730 --> 30:13.731
(computer chirping)

30:13.765 --> 30:17.735
So who's your friend? Really?

30:17.769 --> 30:19.103
All that matters is
he's my friend,

30:19.137 --> 30:20.417
and I'd do anything to help him.

30:22.341 --> 30:23.541
How about you?

30:23.575 --> 30:24.775
Same.

30:24.810 --> 30:26.711
Good.

30:26.745 --> 30:28.546
Yeah. Hurry up.

30:28.580 --> 30:29.981
Okay.

30:30.015 --> 30:32.650
(keyboard keys clicking)

30:32.684 --> 30:34.318
Gummy worm?

30:34.353 --> 30:35.753
(laughs)

30:35.787 --> 30:37.722
Seriously?

30:37.756 --> 30:40.324
Made you laugh.

30:40.359 --> 30:42.927
Thanks.

30:59.144 --> 31:01.512
She's in there.
Yeah.

31:01.546 --> 31:03.981
Are you sure your friend can
disable their security system?

31:04.016 --> 31:06.851
He hasn't let me down yet.
Hey.

31:07.886 --> 31:09.854
Save her.

31:09.888 --> 31:12.289
Always.

31:24.469 --> 31:26.037
(grunting)

31:28.640 --> 31:30.508
Why are you doing this?

31:30.542 --> 31:31.709
What do you want?

32:06.170 --> 32:08.905
(Catherine panting)

32:13.077 --> 32:15.244
MAN: We just lost the feed!
What the hell?

32:15.279 --> 32:17.613
MAN: We lost the feed!
MAN 2: What's happening here?

32:19.149 --> 32:20.450
I did it.

32:21.318 --> 32:23.019
Vincent was right.

32:26.623 --> 32:28.224
We've been hacked.

32:28.258 --> 32:30.760
Surround the building.

32:30.794 --> 32:31.928
Lock it down!

32:31.962 --> 32:33.496
Come on, move out,
move, move out!

32:33.530 --> 32:36.899
(exclaims)
It's okay, it's okay.

32:36.934 --> 32:39.469
It's okay.
I'm here to save you, all right?

32:41.004 --> 32:43.573
(click)
Go.

32:43.607 --> 32:46.442
MAN: Descanso, Volve,
this way!

32:48.512 --> 32:50.913
Aah!
(groans)

32:50.948 --> 32:53.149
You're hurt.

32:53.183 --> 32:54.951
Yeah. What's new?

32:55.986 --> 32:57.453
She's not here.

33:00.691 --> 33:02.692
We got to get out of here.

33:10.167 --> 33:12.368
This isn't the first time
you've saved me, is it?

33:12.402 --> 33:14.270
No.

33:14.304 --> 33:16.706
I wasn't imagining things.
You were there that night.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.641
Yeah, it was me.

33:18.675 --> 33:22.145
All these years everybody
thought I was crazy.

33:22.179 --> 33:23.779
What's your name?

33:23.814 --> 33:25.781
Vincent.

33:25.816 --> 33:29.218
Where have you been
all my life, Vincent?

33:32.656 --> 33:33.990
(gunfire)

33:42.766 --> 33:44.066
Get her out of here!

33:44.101 --> 33:45.434
Come on, go, let's go!

33:49.106 --> 33:50.339
Go!
Let's go!

34:33.884 --> 34:36.118
To the tree line-- go!

34:36.152 --> 34:37.954
Fan out!

34:44.761 --> 34:47.396
(grunts)
Aah!

34:47.431 --> 34:48.598
We got to keep moving.

34:48.632 --> 34:49.732
Wait, wait. Wait, this isn't...

34:49.766 --> 34:50.766
this isn't right.

34:50.801 --> 34:52.768
Right?
Yeah.

34:52.803 --> 34:55.137
We have to run. They're gonna
kill you. They're gonna kill us!

34:55.172 --> 34:56.806
No, no, no.
It's not real.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.775
All right? None of this
is real, it can't be real.

34:59.810 --> 35:01.744
(grunts) Stop!

35:01.778 --> 35:04.080
What more do you want from me?

35:04.114 --> 35:06.782
Shh! I don't understand.
What are you doing?

35:06.817 --> 35:09.085
I don't understand, either.

35:09.119 --> 35:10.386
I thought if I found you,

35:10.420 --> 35:11.988
helped you find the answers,

35:12.022 --> 35:13.389
everything would go back.

35:13.423 --> 35:15.658
Back, what do you mean?
Back to what?

35:15.692 --> 35:17.660
Back to us.

35:17.694 --> 35:20.730
Back to normal.

35:20.764 --> 35:22.398
(grunts)
Aah!

35:22.432 --> 35:25.868
But things
are just as bad here.

35:28.105 --> 35:31.073
Maybe you are better off
without me after all.

35:31.108 --> 35:33.476
Vincent, listen to me.

35:33.510 --> 35:36.012
I've spent most of my life
looking for answers.

35:36.046 --> 35:38.414
And now that I've finally
found them, now that I have

35:38.448 --> 35:41.851
found you, I'm not giving up.
I am not losing you.

35:41.885 --> 35:43.953
Hang in there,
Vincent, please.

35:43.987 --> 35:45.488
Don't give up.
Come back to me.

35:47.724 --> 35:49.325
Don't give up, Vincent, please.

35:49.359 --> 35:51.861
<i>Don't give up.</i>
<i>Come back to me. I need you.</i>

35:51.895 --> 35:53.229
I need you.

35:55.465 --> 35:57.466
OFFICER:
Check the alley.

36:00.170 --> 36:02.538
I love you.
(growling)

36:02.572 --> 36:04.407
Now, on me!
This way, this way.

36:05.909 --> 36:07.209
I love you.

36:07.244 --> 36:08.344
We're moving in.

36:08.378 --> 36:09.679
I love you.

36:09.713 --> 36:12.248
(growling, panting)

36:13.750 --> 36:16.285
Where am I?

36:16.320 --> 36:18.854
It's okay, you're okay.
You're home.

36:25.529 --> 36:27.530
No scar?

36:29.833 --> 36:32.401
No.
No scar. Oh, no scar.

36:32.436 --> 36:33.569
You okay?
What happened?

36:33.603 --> 36:35.204
Just... a terrible,

36:35.238 --> 36:38.007
terrible, terrible dream,
that's all.

36:41.011 --> 36:43.512
OFFICER: Wentzel, Harkington,
enter the building!

36:43.547 --> 36:44.980
Freeze!
NYPD. It's fine.

36:45.015 --> 36:46.716
Medical attention's
needed.

36:46.750 --> 36:49.051
OFFICER:
All right, stand down.

36:49.086 --> 36:51.620
(sighs)
You know who I am, right?

36:59.066 --> 37:00.577
How can you not know

37:00.578 --> 37:01.739
why they were
shooting at you?

37:02.060 --> 37:06.363
Well, I mean, they weren't
exactly shooting at me, per Se.

37:06.463 --> 37:08.931
So, what, you just happened
to be here with Dr. Keller?

37:08.966 --> 37:10.433
At 3:00 in the morning?

37:10.467 --> 37:12.502
Yeah, well, you know...

37:12.536 --> 37:13.836
Tess?

37:13.871 --> 37:15.228
Uh, I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

37:15.229 --> 37:17.163
He's actually not allowed
to answer your questions.

37:17.198 --> 37:19.165
Why not?
I'm why not.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.900
It's all part of a classified

37:20.935 --> 37:22.836
DHS undercover operation,
Lieutenant.

37:22.870 --> 37:24.070
We'll take it from here.

37:24.105 --> 37:25.839
But thank you
for coming to our rescue.

37:25.873 --> 37:29.509
Yeah, sure thing.
Anytime.

37:29.543 --> 37:31.978
Oh, by the way, the
snipers got away.

37:32.012 --> 37:35.782
There's no sign
of them, nothing.

37:37.752 --> 37:40.791
There is no sign of the one
who attacked Cat and Vincent

37:40.792 --> 37:43.661
in their apartment, either.
Whoever's behind this knows

37:43.695 --> 37:45.463
how to cover their
tracks. They're pros.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.632
And there's no leads
on who sent the snipers at all?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.534
No. But, uh, we're
starting to think

37:49.568 --> 37:51.969
that it's not whoever's behind
the beast bounty. We think

37:52.004 --> 37:53.771
somebody else is trying
to kill Vincent.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.140
And kill all of us, too.

37:56.174 --> 37:58.109
Okay, I'm not following.
It didn't make sense

37:58.143 --> 38:00.978
last week, either.
They've clearly been trying

38:01.013 --> 38:03.014
to capture a beast all along,

38:03.048 --> 38:06.050
so why suddenly go for
the nuclear option?

38:06.084 --> 38:07.985
Lure us all here
for a turkey shoot?

38:08.020 --> 38:09.987
Okay, are you telling me
we've got two sets of bad guys

38:10.022 --> 38:11.989
to worry about now?
Yes, and

38:12.024 --> 38:13.324
one is sending bounty hunters

38:13.358 --> 38:15.126
and the other
is sending assassins.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.828
Which means we're all
still in somebody's crosshairs.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.164
Okay. Hey, well,
you better lay low

38:20.198 --> 38:21.399
until we figure this out.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.000
Can you get
police protection?

38:23.035 --> 38:24.902
No, not without giving
an explanation why,

38:24.937 --> 38:27.171
which I obviously can't.
All right.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.473
Let me see what I can do, okay?

38:29.508 --> 38:31.742
And have Cat call me
as soon as she can.

38:31.777 --> 38:33.811
Okay?

38:33.845 --> 38:37.081
Eh, not very reassuring, was he?

38:37.115 --> 38:38.583
Ah, feds.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.384
(sighs)

38:40.419 --> 38:42.186
Gummy worm?

38:42.220 --> 38:44.191
Thanks. Idiot.

38:44.192 --> 38:45.458
Made you laugh.

38:54.183 --> 38:55.216
How is he?

38:55.240 --> 38:56.415
Clinically? He's stable.

38:57.488 --> 38:58.459
But as far
as I'm concerned,

38:58.460 --> 39:00.094
if he doesn't start taking
better care of himself,

39:00.129 --> 39:02.830
he is going to die.
All right.

39:02.865 --> 39:05.433
You got shot last week, Vincent.
I told you to lay low

39:05.467 --> 39:07.335
and you didn't.
Well, something came up.

39:07.369 --> 39:10.338
Look, can I go home now?
No.

39:10.372 --> 39:13.307
I'm admitting you this time,
whether you like it or not.

39:13.342 --> 39:16.044
Maybe it'll give you some time
to talk some sense into him.

39:17.713 --> 39:21.649
Well, maybe staying here is
the safer place right now, huh?

39:21.684 --> 39:24.786
Especially with someone
out there trying to kill me.

39:24.820 --> 39:25.853
Kill us.

39:25.888 --> 39:28.189
Dr. Heidari's right,
Vincent.

39:28.223 --> 39:30.658
Big bad beast aside...

39:30.693 --> 39:32.694
you're still human.

39:34.363 --> 39:35.830
Yeah.

39:35.864 --> 39:37.031
I can't do this without you.

39:37.066 --> 39:38.266
I don't want to.

39:38.300 --> 39:41.102
You sure about that?

39:41.136 --> 39:44.005
I'm positive.

39:52.481 --> 39:54.348
I thought I'd lost you.

39:57.720 --> 39:59.520
I mean,
I knew it wasn't real,

39:59.555 --> 40:01.155
but it sure as hell
felt like it.

40:01.190 --> 40:02.990
And Evan was in your dream?

40:03.025 --> 40:04.225
Mm-hmm.

40:04.259 --> 40:06.661
In fact, you were
married to the guy.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.129
You probably
won't believe this,

40:08.163 --> 40:11.165
but Evan and I actually had
a bit of bonding time.

40:11.200 --> 40:13.000
Yeah, okay,
maybe I was hallucinating.

40:13.035 --> 40:15.737
Yeah, you were
hallucinating.

40:15.771 --> 40:18.139
Yeah. And on top
of all that craziness,

40:18.173 --> 40:20.041
you know, I actually
did learn something.

40:20.075 --> 40:21.843
And that, my dear wife,

40:21.877 --> 40:25.580
is that you are not
better off without me after all.

40:25.614 --> 40:28.750
I mean, yes, you saved me,
you got me out of the shadows,

40:28.784 --> 40:32.186
but... in some ways
I kind of saved you, too.

40:33.555 --> 40:35.356
With your mom.

40:35.390 --> 40:38.659
Right? I helped you find
the answers to help you heal.

40:38.694 --> 40:40.762
We helped heal
each other, Vincent.

40:40.796 --> 40:42.090
Yeah.

40:42.114 --> 40:43.698
And while we're
on that subject,

40:43.699 --> 40:45.233
you are not
going anywhere

40:45.267 --> 40:47.368
until you've completely
healed this time.

40:47.402 --> 40:49.737
Well, sounds
good to me.

40:49.772 --> 40:51.272
But then what?

40:51.306 --> 40:52.940
Doesn't change the fact
that there's somebody

40:52.975 --> 40:55.042
still out there
trying to kill us.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.245
Or that someone else is
trying to capture you.

40:57.279 --> 40:58.946
Which leaves us where, exactly?

40:58.981 --> 41:00.515
More determined than ever
to kick some ass

41:00.549 --> 41:02.850
and finally get our
happily ever after back.

41:02.885 --> 41:04.085
Uh-huh.

41:05.988 --> 41:07.388
On the other hand,
maybe we should just

41:07.422 --> 41:09.690
move away from this window,
just to be safe.

41:09.725 --> 41:10.858
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

41:10.893 --> 41:13.594
Yeah.
