00:00.213 --> 00:02.338
So here's what you missed
<i>on</i> Glee: <i>Kurt and Rachel made</i>

00:02.458 --> 00:03.937
<i>the final cut for NYADA,</i>
<i>which means the biggest</i>

00:04.058 --> 00:05.238
<i>audition of their lives</i>
<i>is coming up if</i>

00:05.358 --> 00:06.875
they want their big time Broadway
dreams to come true.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.047
<i>Puck has big-time pool-cleaning</i>
<i>business dreams,</i>

00:09.148 --> 00:10.399
<i>but first he has to graduate.</i>

00:10.483 --> 00:11.767
<i>Roz Washington's been trying</i>
<i>to steal</i>

00:11.851 --> 00:13.151
<i>the Cheerios! from Sue</i>
<i>the same way</i>

00:13.219 --> 00:14.853
<i>Beiste stole</i>
<i>Cooter the football recruiter</i>

00:14.904 --> 00:16.772
<i>and got married</i>
<i>after a romantic taco dinner.</i>

00:16.856 --> 00:18.547
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:23.592 --> 00:26.114
RACHEL: <i>Deep in space there are
giant interstellar clouds.</i>

00:26.199 --> 00:28.116
<i>Most of them just float</i>
<i>through the universe,</i>

00:28.201 --> 00:31.253
<i>content to be balls</i>
<i>of gas and space dust,</i>

00:31.337 --> 00:32.753
<i>but there are special ones.</i>

00:32.839 --> 00:34.423
<i>Maybe they collide</i>
<i>with a supernova</i>

00:34.507 --> 00:37.042
<i>or are just made up</i>
<i>of something extra amazing,</i>

00:37.093 --> 00:40.462
<i>but one day they just get too</i>
<i>big for the nebulas they're in</i>

00:40.546 --> 00:42.097
<i>and with the sheer</i>
<i>gravitational force</i>

00:42.181 --> 00:45.967
<i>of their awesomeness,</i>
<i>they become a star.</i>

00:47.920 --> 00:49.638
I am that amazing cloud.

00:49.722 --> 00:51.573
My whole life has led
to this moment.

00:51.641 --> 00:53.308
<i>My NYADA audition is this week.</i>

00:53.393 --> 00:55.394
<i>All of the singing and</i>
<i>dancing lessons and hours spent</i>

00:55.445 --> 00:57.279
<i>until late into the night</i>
<i>practicing</i>

00:57.363 --> 00:58.613
<i>my Oscar acceptance speech</i>
<i>into a mirror</i>

00:58.698 --> 01:01.533
<i>are just about</i>
<i>to come home to find purchase.</i>

01:01.601 --> 01:03.902
<i>My fiancé couldn't be</i>
<i>more excited or supportive.</i>

01:03.953 --> 01:07.572
Happy. Sad. Surprised.
Thoughtful. Presidential.

01:08.774 --> 01:10.125
Hmm.

01:10.209 --> 01:11.460
RACHEL:
<i>I have some simple rules</i>

01:11.544 --> 01:12.911
<i>when I'm getting ready</i>
<i>for a big performance.</i>

01:12.962 --> 01:15.163
<i>First, no milk--</i>
<i>makes you too phlegmy.</i>

01:15.248 --> 01:18.633
<i>Second, no doorknobs--</i>
<i>they spread infections.</i>

01:18.718 --> 01:20.218
<i>So do kisses.</i>

01:20.286 --> 01:21.837
<i>So what if I have</i>
<i>some superstitions, too?</i>

01:21.921 --> 01:24.456
<i>I never step on cracks</i>
<i>and sometimes I walk bacards,</i>

01:24.507 --> 01:25.891
<i>and everyone I see becomes</i>
<i>a metaphor</i>

01:25.958 --> 01:27.642
<i>for the things</i>
<i>that could stop me.</i>

01:30.730 --> 01:33.515
<i>I just give each one</i>
<i>my gold star death stare.</i>

01:33.599 --> 01:35.183
<i>None of them stand a chance.</i>

01:35.268 --> 01:39.521
You are a star, Rachel Berry,
and in just two days from now

01:39.605 --> 01:41.806
you are going to shine
so bright on that stage

01:41.858 --> 01:45.277
that the sun is going
to cry with envy.

01:45.344 --> 01:48.764
You know when your time is,
and it's now.

01:51.951 --> 01:53.818
(bell ringing)

01:55.955 --> 01:57.289
Hey, listen, man...

01:57.340 --> 02:00.375
I overheard you talking to
that sophomore girl yesterday.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.160
Whoa, back off, dude,
you've got a fiancée.

02:02.211 --> 02:03.595
Plus, I called dibs
on all the chicks

02:03.662 --> 02:04.846
whose boobs aren't
done growing yet.

02:04.848 --> 02:06.465
Not that, okay?

02:06.516 --> 02:08.433
You guys were talking
about graduation.

02:08.501 --> 02:10.168
Yeah, I might not graduate,

02:10.219 --> 02:12.804
but it's okay 'cause
gowns are for ladies

02:12.855 --> 02:14.272
and tassels are for strippers.

02:16.675 --> 02:18.343
Dude, hear me out.

02:18.394 --> 02:20.145
I know you got
your pool-cleaning business

02:20.196 --> 02:22.481
and everything, but even if
college isn't your thing,

02:22.532 --> 02:24.116
it's still important
to graduate.

02:24.183 --> 02:25.400
You gotta think ahead.

02:25.485 --> 02:27.402
Who knows, maybe one day
you're gonna want

02:27.487 --> 02:29.404
to clean the White House pool
or something.

02:29.489 --> 02:31.523
I appreciate the brovention,
but I just told her that

02:31.574 --> 02:33.358
so I can get a sympathy
pants massage.

02:33.409 --> 02:35.193
I'll be getting my diploma
right next you.

02:35.244 --> 02:37.913
I'm doing good in auto,
metal and wood shop.

02:37.997 --> 02:40.749
So, all I gotta do is pass Mrs. Doosenberry's
European Geography test

02:40.833 --> 02:42.000
and I can graduate.

02:42.051 --> 02:44.136
Yeah, but how are you
going to do that?

02:44.203 --> 02:45.587
I got a plan.

02:45.671 --> 02:48.757
Okay, class, what can you tell
me about the Danube River?

02:48.841 --> 02:50.041
Mr. Puckerman?

02:50.092 --> 02:51.560
It's wet.

02:51.644 --> 02:52.844
Real wet.

02:54.514 --> 02:56.681
I may not be too good
at world geography,

02:56.732 --> 02:58.850
but I'm real good
at female geography.

02:58.901 --> 03:01.019
I'm gonna give
Doosenberry a little P-U-C-K

03:01.070 --> 03:02.904
so I don't get an "F."

03:04.190 --> 03:05.574
(bell ringing)
Hmm.

03:05.658 --> 03:09.394
You guys, I just went to my
first student council meeting,

03:09.445 --> 03:12.030
and I found out that we have
another prom this year.

03:12.081 --> 03:13.748
So, as president, I need
to come up with a theme.

03:13.833 --> 03:16.334
And I'm thinking,
if we do alien abductions,

03:16.402 --> 03:18.920
we could set up cornfields
and probing booths.

03:19.005 --> 03:20.956
Great. Yeah. All right.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.407
SANTANA: Aw, hell.

03:22.458 --> 03:25.343
Looks like Mr. Beiste went
all Chris Brown on Mrs. Beiste--

03:25.411 --> 03:27.462
What happened, Coach, Cooter
put the smack-down on you

03:27.547 --> 03:29.464
'cause you wouldn't
let him be on top?

03:29.549 --> 03:31.516
(laughter)
What did you just say?

03:31.584 --> 03:33.084
Nothing.
It was a joke.

03:33.135 --> 03:35.720
So, men hitting women
is funny to you?

03:35.771 --> 03:37.105
Oh, please.
We obviously don't think

03:37.190 --> 03:38.356
Beiste was hit by anybody.

03:38.424 --> 03:39.608
I mean, look at her,
she's a wall.

03:39.692 --> 03:40.809
Let me tell you something.

03:40.893 --> 03:42.561
I'm Coach Roz Washington.

03:42.612 --> 03:44.896
I'm an Olympic Champion,
and I do not suffer fools!

03:44.947 --> 03:48.483
Especially fools who think
domestic violence is funny.

03:48.568 --> 03:49.551
I want your names.

03:49.619 --> 03:51.453
Shannon!

03:51.537 --> 03:53.405
Write these names
down as placeholders.

03:53.456 --> 03:54.406
Hatrack.

03:54.457 --> 03:55.740
Asian Horror Movie.

03:55.791 --> 03:56.541
Li'l Oprah.

03:56.609 --> 03:58.276
Rojo Caliente.

03:58.327 --> 04:00.629
Salsa Caliente.

04:00.713 --> 04:02.380
You're on my list now, girls.

04:02.448 --> 04:05.500
You just watch
what happens next.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.457
(bell ringing)
Black Sue,

04:12.508 --> 04:14.059
it's no secret I despise you.

04:14.126 --> 04:17.428
I spent the weekend sending
your photo to ivory poachers

04:17.480 --> 04:19.231
who could make an
absolute fortune

04:19.298 --> 04:22.317
selling your enormous white
teeth on the black market.

04:22.401 --> 04:25.303
Yet it sounds like you and I finally
have something to agree on.

04:25.354 --> 04:27.305
Look, I understand
kids making jokes

04:27.356 --> 04:29.024
about things they find
uncomfortable,

04:29.108 --> 04:31.610
like how there's a cheerleading
coach at their school

04:31.661 --> 04:34.279
who's old as dirt and still
trying to have a baby,

04:34.330 --> 04:36.998
who they know is gonna come out
looking weird with rabies

04:37.083 --> 04:39.584
and wings, and it's gonna
fly out of your head box

04:39.652 --> 04:41.486
and straight back into hell.

04:41.537 --> 04:43.622
But domestic violence?

04:43.673 --> 04:46.091
That's nothing to joke about.
I couldn't agree with you more.

04:46.158 --> 04:47.876
WILL:
Hey! Mind if we join you ladies?

04:47.960 --> 04:50.495
What are you guys talking about?
Your shiner.

04:50.546 --> 04:52.097
William, your teenage minions

04:52.164 --> 04:53.765
have taken this opportunity

04:53.832 --> 04:55.833
to start making jokes
about violence against women.

04:55.885 --> 04:57.769
Are you serious?

04:57.836 --> 04:58.836
BEISTE: Wait a second.

04:58.888 --> 05:00.355
They think I got hit?

05:00.439 --> 05:02.524
I was at the gym
hitting the speedbag,

05:02.608 --> 05:05.560
but my timing was off,
and it came back and clocked me.

05:05.645 --> 05:06.844
I can't believe any of my kids

05:06.896 --> 05:08.196
would make a joke about
something that serious.

05:08.281 --> 05:10.315
Well, you better believe it,
whatever your name is.

05:10.366 --> 05:12.067
I heard 'em
with my own two ears.

05:12.151 --> 05:14.202
Yeah, you've got a problem
on your hands, William.

05:14.287 --> 05:16.288
But not to worry.
John Goodman,

05:16.355 --> 05:19.023

06:39.606 --> 06:41.106
I've always been ahead

06:45.829 --> 06:47.780
it's boring-- I'm bored!

06:47.831 --> 06:48.965
I think you're overthinking it.

06:49.049 --> 06:51.167
Excuse me, my foot fall asleep.

06:51.251 --> 06:52.218
I can't feel it at all.

06:52.285 --> 06:53.169
Can I go walk it off?

06:53.253 --> 06:54.921
Yeah, sure, just don't go far.

06:54.972 --> 06:56.138
And thanks.

06:56.223 --> 06:57.723
Okay.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.291
I'm starting from scratch.

06:59.343 --> 07:01.177
I need something fresh.

07:01.261 --> 07:06.148
I need something edgy, something
completely unpredictable.

07:06.233 --> 07:08.434
Or maybe I just
need more candles.

07:08.485 --> 07:09.635
Oh, God, no.

07:09.686 --> 07:10.653
No more candles.

07:11.972 --> 07:13.823
(bell ringing)

07:18.245 --> 07:19.829
Noah, why are you
closing the door?

07:19.913 --> 07:21.364
So the chemistry
doesn't get out.

07:21.448 --> 07:24.450
I brought you some illegal
fireworks I got in Tennessee

07:24.501 --> 07:28.588
to remind you of us--
all explosive and taboo.

07:28.655 --> 07:30.957
There is no "us," Mr. Puckerman.

07:31.008 --> 07:34.844
Eleanor-- can I call you that?
No.

07:34.928 --> 07:36.679
I've wanted you
since ninth grade

07:36.763 --> 07:39.131
ever since I saw you
at that Canned Food Drive

07:39.182 --> 07:40.132
for depressed Hawaiians.

07:40.183 --> 07:41.667
Displaced Haitians.

07:41.718 --> 07:44.654
Mmm... Your brain
turns me on.

07:48.725 --> 07:50.109

07:50.176 --> 07:51.176
Oh...

07:51.228 --> 07:52.311
Oh, oh, oh!

07:52.362 --> 07:55.531
I...
I might be recently divorced

07:55.616 --> 07:58.017
and excruciatily lonely,
but I can't be bought.

07:58.068 --> 07:59.402
I not buying you!

07:59.469 --> 08:01.570
Just give me a D-minus,
and I'll tickle your thighs.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.322
All right, we're done
here, Mr. Puckerman.

08:03.373 --> 08:05.992
Look, lady, if you don't
pass me, I'll flunk out.

08:06.043 --> 08:07.860
Oh, well, maybe, oh, just maybe,

08:07.911 --> 08:10.329
you could crack open a book
and study like everyone else.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.631
I can't!
I'm too stupid.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.365
You're not stupid, Noah.

08:13.417 --> 08:14.533
You're just lazy.

08:14.584 --> 08:16.869
Screw you.
And screw McKinley.

10:25.999 --> 10:27.762
(bell ringing)

10:29.319 --> 10:32.497
Now I realize this room is
America's number one destination

10:32.609 --> 10:34.560
for cheap, sappy moralizing,

10:34.676 --> 10:35.960
but your insensitive behavior

10:36.082 --> 10:39.995
is about to subject you to a
whole new level of preachiness.

10:40.115 --> 10:42.283
Is this about the comment that
I made in the hallway earlier?

10:42.367 --> 10:43.796
You bet your perfectly
round ass it is.

10:43.896 --> 10:46.398
Coach Sylvester, I hardly
think you're one to preach

10:46.482 --> 10:48.433
on what we can
and cannot joke about.

10:48.518 --> 10:50.235
Yeah. You make fun of us
all the time.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.271
Sandbags, I admit
I can be a bit abrasive.

10:52.355 --> 10:54.356
And yes, I've fantasized
about slapping each and every

10:54.407 --> 10:57.392
one of you square across the
face with a sturdy, wet fish.

10:57.443 --> 10:59.194
But that doesn't mean
you deserve it.

10:59.245 --> 11:00.793
No one deserves to get hit.

11:00.913 --> 11:02.431
Coach Sylvester,
we already know that.

11:02.551 --> 11:04.769
Yeah, and none of our guys would
ever do anything like that.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.733
And if they did,
we'd just get the hell out.

11:06.853 --> 11:08.354
I don't think
the gravity of this

11:08.405 --> 11:09.822
is landing with you girls.

11:09.890 --> 11:12.408
I think that not one
of you understand

11:12.492 --> 11:14.456
what violence in a home
really feels like.

11:14.706 --> 11:17.747
When I was growing up,
my aunt married a man

11:17.831 --> 11:19.332
that was nice to everybody.

11:19.399 --> 11:21.701
Used to bring us presents
when he came to visit

11:21.752 --> 11:24.754
and never had an unkind
word to say to anybody.

11:24.838 --> 11:28.174
But at home, he had a temper.

11:28.241 --> 11:30.293
And that man
started beating her.

11:30.377 --> 11:32.912
She'd lie, she'd make
a joke out of it.

11:32.980 --> 11:34.964
She said she'd done
this or that wrong.

11:35.048 --> 11:36.265
She'd tell my momma

11:36.350 --> 11:39.242
he was a good man
and she had it coming.

11:39.617 --> 11:43.422
It took my aunt five years

11:43.473 --> 11:46.192
and a trip to ICU

11:46.259 --> 11:51.186
to stop making excuses for
that man and get a divorce.

11:51.306 --> 11:54.450
Ladies, the American songbook
is chock-full of songs

11:54.534 --> 11:56.435
making light of men
hitting women.

11:56.486 --> 11:57.737
And since the only way to

11:57.788 --> 11:59.288
get anything into
your thick, dopey heads

11:59.373 --> 12:01.957
is to force you to sing about
it, for this week's assignment,

12:02.042 --> 12:06.045
I want you to turn those songs
into songs of empowerment

12:06.112 --> 12:09.782
that say, "You lay a hand on me,
it's over."

12:12.135 --> 12:14.053
(school bell ringing)

12:15.922 --> 12:18.090
Blaine, I need some help.

12:18.141 --> 12:20.176
Tina wants me to slick
my hair back for prom,

12:20.260 --> 12:22.812
and I've never used gel, so I
have no idea what I'm doing.

12:22.896 --> 12:24.463
Biggest tip I can give you:

12:24.514 --> 12:26.799
never brush after you gel.
Disaster.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.268
Second tip: feel free
to use a little sweat

12:29.319 --> 12:31.687
or a little splash of water
to reactivate the gel

12:31.772 --> 12:33.472
or give it a complete new look.

12:33.523 --> 12:34.640
See that?

12:34.691 --> 12:36.942
It's a whole new 'do,
my friend.

12:36.993 --> 12:38.744
Hey.

12:38.812 --> 12:40.996
I hear you guys talking a lot,

12:41.081 --> 12:42.915
but is anybody gonna
mention what's missing,

12:42.982 --> 12:43.916
what's different here?

12:43.983 --> 12:45.284
(snaps fingers)

12:45.335 --> 12:47.119
You finally shook the last
five pounds. Dude, congrats!

12:47.170 --> 12:48.621
(murmuring, cheering)
Big deal, big deal.

12:48.672 --> 12:50.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:50.924 --> 12:51.841
It's Puck.

12:51.925 --> 12:54.293
He's not here.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.128
Dropped completely off the grid.

12:56.179 --> 12:57.213
Anybody notice that?

12:58.265 --> 12:59.348
Doesn't even log on

12:59.433 --> 13:00.599
to Call of Duty tourneys
anymore.

13:00.667 --> 13:01.851
Oh, no.

13:01.935 --> 13:02.852
I'm going into
full-blown prayer mode.

13:02.936 --> 13:04.220
Look, we need to go

13:04.304 --> 13:05.971
all <i>Black Hawk Down</i> here.

13:06.022 --> 13:07.556
All he needs to pass
is that one test.

13:07.641 --> 13:09.775
Either we all graduate together

13:09.843 --> 13:11.143
or what was the point
of all this?

13:11.194 --> 13:13.479
No man gets left behind.

13:13.530 --> 13:16.232
We will get him to pass.

13:16.316 --> 13:17.683
By any means necessary.

13:18.618 --> 13:19.485
Right!

13:19.536 --> 13:20.519
(school bell ringing)

13:20.570 --> 13:22.455
Excuse me.
Um, this is insanity.

13:22.522 --> 13:23.989
Wait, why are you
talking to me?

13:24.040 --> 13:25.524
I thought you were saving
your voice for your audition.

13:25.575 --> 13:26.992
No, I vowed
not to speak with you

13:27.043 --> 13:28.327
unless William and Kate
got pregnant,

13:28.378 --> 13:29.628
Liza passed or unless one of us
was in grave danger.

13:29.696 --> 13:32.081
Tell me Liza's okay.
She's fine, but you're not.

13:32.165 --> 13:33.666
Okay, I just talked to Blaine
and he told me

13:33.717 --> 13:34.967
about "Not The Boy Next Door."

13:35.034 --> 13:36.886
You cannot sing that
for your NYADA your audition.

13:36.970 --> 13:39.889
I need to be excited about this,
and this is the first time

13:39.973 --> 13:41.540
I've been inspired in
this whole process.

13:41.591 --> 13:43.709
No, no,
it's too controversial, okay?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.845
You can't wear Peter Allen's
gold lamé pants.

13:45.896 --> 13:47.713
It was too
controversial in 1962.

13:47.764 --> 13:48.848
(sighs)

13:48.899 --> 13:50.566
Look, the play, and that song,

13:50.650 --> 13:51.851
won Hugh Jackman the Tony.
I know.

13:51.902 --> 13:54.052
And NYADA is a Broadway school.

13:54.104 --> 13:55.354
Yes, but you haven't
rehearsed it enough, okay?

13:55.405 --> 13:57.273
I'm not singing "Don't Rain
on my Parade" because

13:57.357 --> 13:59.492
it's my go-to song and
because it's impossible for me

13:59.559 --> 14:01.861
not to cry when I sing it,
but because I have been

14:01.912 --> 14:04.163
belting out that song
since I was two years old.

14:04.230 --> 14:06.115
All right, this is,
this is the biggest,

14:06.199 --> 14:07.867
biggest moment
of our lives here.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.835
We cannot be taking risks.

14:09.903 --> 14:12.254
Isn't that the exact
moment to take a risk?

14:12.339 --> 14:15.758
Kurt, can I be honest with you?

14:15.842 --> 14:17.510
I think this is
self-sabotage.

14:17.577 --> 14:19.762
All right, you're scared
you're not going to get in,

14:19.846 --> 14:21.046
so you're using
something to blame

14:21.097 --> 14:23.415
just in case this all
doesn't work out.

14:27.637 --> 14:29.855
Do you really think
I'm doing that?

14:29.923 --> 14:31.974
I think you think
you're not good enough.

14:32.058 --> 14:33.258
But you are good enough.

14:33.310 --> 14:34.944
Okay, you don't
have to go and do

14:35.028 --> 14:36.812
some big, flamboyant number,
all right?

14:36.897 --> 14:40.115
"Music of the Night" is
your "Don't Rain on My Parade."

14:40.200 --> 14:42.034
I'm torn.

14:42.101 --> 14:43.486
Uh, I have been
practicing Phantom

14:43.570 --> 14:44.787
for the last three months. Yes!

14:44.871 --> 14:48.457
And-and I believe in you,
and I believe that song.

14:48.542 --> 14:50.493
So much that I will be
your Christine.

14:50.577 --> 14:52.127
You will?
I will.

14:52.212 --> 14:54.279
Okay, let's do it!

14:54.331 --> 14:55.915
"Music of the Night" it is.
Good! All right, good.

14:55.966 --> 14:57.917
Tina won't mind being recast.
No, she won't, so...

14:57.968 --> 14:59.284
Oh, that's great! Okay. Okay.

14:59.336 --> 15:00.920
NYADA's not gonna know what hit them.
Uh-uh.

15:00.971 --> 15:01.754
Trust me.
Okay.

15:01.805 --> 15:03.222
And now,

15:03.289 --> 15:06.342
the six merry murderesses
of the Cook County Jail

Like Bernie.

15:46.182 --> 15:48.667
Bernie-- he liked to chew gum.

15:48.718 --> 15:51.720
No, not chew, pop.

15:51.805 --> 15:54.807
So I came home this one day,
and I'm really irritated,

15:54.858 --> 15:56.809
and I'm looking for
a little bit of sympathy.

15:56.860 --> 15:59.528
And there's Bernie
lying on the couch,

15:59.613 --> 16:01.647
drinking a beer and chewing--

16:01.698 --> 16:04.199
no, not chewing, popping!

16:04.284 --> 16:06.235
So, I said to him, I said,

16:06.319 --> 16:09.455
"You pop that gum
one more time..."

16:09.522 --> 16:10.522
(sighs)

16:10.574 --> 16:11.991
And he did.

16:12.042 --> 16:13.459
So I took the shotgun
off the wall

16:13.526 --> 16:17.796
and I fired two warning shots.

16:17.864 --> 16:21.967

16:48.227 --> 16:50.896
He was crazy,

16:50.947 --> 16:53.032
"You been doing the milkman."

16:53.083 --> 16:54.399
And then he ran into my knife.

one of my all-time favorite

17:34.190 --> 17:36.458
Kander and Ebb tunes, while
completely missing the point

17:36.543 --> 17:38.777
of absolutely everything.

17:38.828 --> 17:40.796
You girls are cray-cray.

17:40.864 --> 17:42.131
You were supposed
to pick a song

17:42.215 --> 17:44.600
that gave women the
self-esteem and courage

17:44.668 --> 17:47.052
to get the hell out of
an abusive situation.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
But, oh, no.

17:48.171 --> 17:50.389
You pick a song about
crazy women

17:50.456 --> 17:52.758
in their panties killing
their men for chewing gum.

17:52.809 --> 17:54.126
How is that supposed to help?

17:56.012 --> 17:57.680
(school bell ringing)

17:57.764 --> 17:59.464
How dare you stand up and leave?

17:59.516 --> 18:01.100
We all wanted out of that room.

18:01.151 --> 18:02.317
I'm sorry.

18:02.402 --> 18:03.686
I was sitting there
listening to that song,

18:03.770 --> 18:05.470
and I couldn't handle it.

18:05.522 --> 18:06.822
I was too embarrassed.

18:06.906 --> 18:08.323
Why would you be embarrassed?

18:08.408 --> 18:10.609
Those girls were the ones
stinking up that auditorium.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.494
He hit me.

18:12.562 --> 18:14.697
I didn't get hurt

18:14.781 --> 18:16.865
boxing at the gym.

18:16.950 --> 18:18.150
Cooter hit me.

18:19.502 --> 18:21.286
He'd been bugging me all weekend

18:21.337 --> 18:23.789
to do the dishes,
and I-I promised him I would,

18:23.840 --> 18:24.990
but I forgot.

18:25.041 --> 18:26.341
And then when he
came home from work,

18:26.426 --> 18:28.510
I could tell he had
had a few drinks.

18:28.595 --> 18:30.796
And he started yelling, and
I tried to calm him down,

18:30.847 --> 18:32.131
and then he hit me.

18:32.182 --> 18:33.432
But as soon as it happened,

18:33.499 --> 18:36.101
I mean, right away,
he was so sorry.

18:36.169 --> 18:38.771
And he started crying and
begging me to forgive him.

18:38.838 --> 18:42.307
Sweetheart, you're as big
as a house.

18:42.375 --> 18:44.560
Why didn't you just turn around
and kick his ass?

18:44.644 --> 18:46.311
I'm not a violent person.

18:46.362 --> 18:48.197
Shannon, you have to get
out of that house right now.

18:48.281 --> 18:49.565
Can't.

18:49.649 --> 18:50.816
I can't leave him.

18:50.867 --> 18:51.700
Why the hell not?

18:54.571 --> 18:56.955
(sobbing softly)

18:57.023 --> 19:00.743
Because I don't think anybody
else is ever going to love me.

19:00.827 --> 19:02.795
Shannon,

19:02.862 --> 19:04.747
listen.

19:04.831 --> 19:07.216
You're gonna stay
with me tonight, okay?

19:07.300 --> 19:09.301
If you don't have
a change of clothes,

19:09.368 --> 19:11.220
I have a tent you can wear.

19:18.678 --> 19:21.346
Looking good, Noah.

19:21.397 --> 19:23.381
Hey, the kids are
at the neighbors.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.901
You want to go for a quickie
in the pool house?

19:25.985 --> 19:27.486
Not this time, Mrs. Collins.

19:27.553 --> 19:29.605
I'm gonna keep it legit
'cause today's my last day.

19:30.824 --> 19:31.940
Final cleaning's on the house--

19:32.025 --> 19:32.991
a good-bye gift.

19:33.059 --> 19:34.193
Last day?
Where are you going?

19:34.244 --> 19:35.994
Isn't graduation coming up?

19:36.062 --> 19:38.280
I'm done with school.
Don't need it.

19:38.364 --> 19:41.450
I'm gonna blow town and get a
head start to the West Coast.

19:41.534 --> 19:42.501
Huh.

19:42.568 --> 19:44.169
Too bad.

19:44.237 --> 19:46.088
I'll miss those abs.

19:56.582 --> 19:58.416
Dad?

20:01.069 --> 20:02.870
All right, everyone,
listen carefully.

20:02.938 --> 20:04.605
Puck's scheduled to arrive
at the Schneider's pool

20:04.656 --> 20:07.872
at 2:00 p.m., which means
he should be there at 3:30.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.042
Sam, you're the driver,

20:09.126 --> 20:10.493
so stay in the car.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.795
Well, can I play
with the radio?

20:11.846 --> 20:12.929
Rory, you're on lookout here.

20:12.997 --> 20:14.214
Who am I looking out for?

20:14.298 --> 20:15.966
I mean, besides Puck?

20:16.017 --> 20:18.802
Blaine, Mike and myself
will triangulate

20:18.853 --> 20:20.804
a very carefully planned
attack on Puck

20:20.855 --> 20:22.939
here, here and here.

20:23.007 --> 20:25.275
Is that a bear I'm hiding behind?
No, no, it's a bush.

20:25.342 --> 20:26.693
Looks like a bear.
It's not a bear.

20:26.777 --> 20:28.011
Maybe a shrub.

20:28.062 --> 20:29.980
What's the difference
between a shrub and a bush?

20:30.031 --> 20:31.347
What do I do?

20:31.399 --> 20:32.616
Oh, that's the best part.

20:32.683 --> 20:34.183
You're going to be the bait.

20:34.235 --> 20:37.070
So, when Puck comes in the gate,
you just roll your wheelchair

20:37.154 --> 20:38.688
into the pool, and
all of a sudden, we...

20:40.858 --> 20:42.709
Are you all right, dude?

20:42.793 --> 20:45.545
Yeah, look like you saw
a ghost, man. What's up?

20:45.630 --> 20:47.831
Just saw my dad.

20:47.882 --> 20:50.500
I haven't seen him
in five years.

20:50.551 --> 20:51.968
I brought us a little refresher.

20:52.036 --> 20:55.588
The last six-pack from
my micro-brewery--

20:55.673 --> 20:59.142
Puckerman's Special Sauce.

20:59.209 --> 21:01.011
I'm good.
Oh, come on.

21:01.062 --> 21:03.730
A dad likes to share a beer
with his son. Be fine.

21:03.814 --> 21:05.348
All right.

21:09.153 --> 21:11.521
So what are you doing here?

21:11.572 --> 21:15.742
I hate to do this, but, uh, I'm
kind of at the end of my rope.

21:15.826 --> 21:17.494
I need to borrow some money.

21:17.561 --> 21:19.245
From me? For what?
Mm-hmm.

21:19.330 --> 21:21.081
Rent.

21:21.165 --> 21:25.919
Hardest thing for a man
to do... is ask for help.

21:27.588 --> 21:28.872
What did you do?

21:28.923 --> 21:31.841
I gave it to him.

21:31.909 --> 21:33.076
500 bucks.

21:34.845 --> 21:36.546
That's most of
my seed money for L.A.

21:36.597 --> 21:38.748
I don't get it. Why?

21:38.799 --> 21:40.600
'Cause I knew
if I gave it to him,

21:40.685 --> 21:42.686
I'd never have to see him again.

21:42.753 --> 21:44.938
You know he dropped
out of high school, too?

21:45.022 --> 21:47.724
Just kept seeing myself
sitting where he was sitting,

21:47.775 --> 21:49.092
across from Beth--

21:49.143 --> 21:51.444
no dignity, no future--

21:51.529 --> 21:52.696
begging her for rent money.

21:52.763 --> 21:54.731
I cannot let that happen to me.

21:54.782 --> 21:56.232
I have to graduate.

21:56.283 --> 21:58.318
And to do that,

21:58.402 --> 22:00.269
I have to pass this damn
European Geography test.

22:01.271 --> 22:03.707
Will you help me?

22:03.774 --> 22:05.375
PUCK:
Please?

22:05.442 --> 22:07.444
Never leave a man behind.

22:10.664 --> 22:12.115
Thanks, bro.

22:15.636 --> 22:16.886
Want some Throat Coat?
Oh.

22:16.954 --> 22:18.454
Just to avoid
last-minute irritation.

22:18.506 --> 22:19.723
Hit me.
Okay.

22:19.790 --> 22:21.558
So, um, Kurt,
you know how they say

22:21.625 --> 22:22.926
that knowledge is power? Mm-hmm.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.594
Okay, well, I got
some last-minute intel

22:24.645 --> 22:26.129
about our NYADA
adjudicator, and...

22:26.180 --> 22:27.597
well, I don't want to make you

22:27.648 --> 22:29.099
any more nervous
than you already are.

22:29.150 --> 22:30.316
Okay, now you have to tell me.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.653
It's Carmen Tibideaux.

22:40.444 --> 22:41.327
My God.
What?

22:41.412 --> 22:42.579
Carmen Tibideaux?

22:42.646 --> 22:43.830
She's one of NYADA's
most famous--

22:43.914 --> 22:45.198
and infamous-- alums.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.033
<i>She's played Broadway.</i>
<i>She's performed</i>

22:47.118 --> 22:48.334
the most demanding roles

22:48.419 --> 22:49.586
in the greatest opera
houses in the world.

22:49.653 --> 22:50.987
I think I'm going to throw up.

22:51.038 --> 22:53.006
Look, my-my dads have been
trolling the NYADA chat rooms,

22:53.090 --> 22:54.657
and they said that she's
been appointed dean

22:54.708 --> 22:56.092
of Vocal Performance
and Song Interpretation,

22:56.160 --> 22:57.994
and now she's going
across the country

22:58.045 --> 22:59.662
to pick out her own
inaugural class.

22:59.713 --> 23:00.997
All right.
KURT: <i>Oh, Rachel,</i>

23:01.048 --> 23:02.599
<i>you know the stories</i>
<i>of her wrath</i>

23:02.666 --> 23:04.050
as well as I do.

23:04.135 --> 23:06.035
Once, "La Tibideaux"
stopped a performance of <i>Medea</i>

23:06.103 --> 23:08.471
<i>at the Met because someone</i>
<i>glanced at their watch</i>

23:08.522 --> 23:11.107
while she was doing one of her
"I'm killing my babies" arias.

23:11.175 --> 23:13.109
<i>She destroyed him.</i>
<i>Do you think she's</i>

23:13.177 --> 23:14.310
going to have any qualms about

23:14.361 --> 23:15.445
cutting us off if
we displease her?

23:15.512 --> 23:16.479
Kurt Hummel.

23:16.530 --> 23:18.565
You're going to be amazing.

23:18.649 --> 23:20.867
All right, I-I believe
in you, and no one

23:20.951 --> 23:22.986
can sing this song
better than you can.

23:23.037 --> 23:25.488
Even Michael Crawford?

23:25.539 --> 23:26.873
(patting on back)

23:26.957 --> 23:28.741
Go... go get 'em.

23:35.049 --> 23:36.466
Hello.

23:36.534 --> 23:37.750
I'm Kurt Hummel,

23:37.835 --> 23:39.752
and I'll be performing
"Music of the Night"

23:39.837 --> 23:40.887
from the seminal
<i>Phantom of the Opera</i>

23:40.971 --> 23:42.472
by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.

23:42.539 --> 23:43.540
(sighs)

23:45.259 --> 23:48.178
Which I bet you hear a lot of.

23:48.229 --> 23:49.545
That song.

23:51.048 --> 23:53.399
That, "The Impossible Dream"
from <i>La Mancha</i>

23:53.484 --> 23:55.518
and "Being Alive"
from <i>Company,</i> yes.

23:56.687 --> 23:58.387
It's a safe and standard choice.

24:00.891 --> 24:03.743
Which is why I've decided
to change things up a bit.

24:05.913 --> 24:08.198
Here, in the 11th hour,

24:08.249 --> 24:10.250
I've decided to go
in a different direction.

24:10.334 --> 24:12.785
Something that's
a little more out there,

24:12.870 --> 24:14.621
but much more me.

24:16.290 --> 24:17.757
"Not the Boy Next Door,"

24:17.842 --> 24:19.792
from the Peter Allen
bio-musical, <i>The Boy from Oz.</i>

24:25.633 --> 24:27.133
Ladies?

24:29.303 --> 24:30.937

Hugh trained with me
the summer I was in residence

26:51.228 --> 26:54.113
at the Sydney Opera House,
and I'm certain

26:54.198 --> 26:56.899
that he would have been...

26:56.950 --> 27:01.237
as impressed with what you did
with that song as I am.

27:01.288 --> 27:03.256
A bold choice, young man.

27:03.340 --> 27:05.591
I congratulate you
for taking such a risk today.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.461
Thank you.

27:08.545 --> 27:09.879

You nervous?

27:39.774 --> 27:42.059

29:22.126 --> 29:24.628
please just give me
one more chance, please.

29:24.695 --> 29:26.079
Please.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.081
Please.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.540
What's the biggest city
in Ireland?

29:37.592 --> 29:38.337
Blarneycock.

29:38.457 --> 29:40.075
Dude, he's pointing
right at it. Come on.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.263
My brain is fried.

29:41.383 --> 29:43.180
It's freaking 3:00
in the morning.

29:43.231 --> 29:44.564
That's awesome--
we've still got

29:44.649 --> 29:46.183
nine hours to cram
before your test.

29:46.234 --> 29:47.651
(Puck groaning)

29:49.520 --> 29:51.238
How's Rachel?

29:51.322 --> 29:53.774
Uh... upset.

29:53.858 --> 29:55.725
Devastated.
Wants to be alone.

29:55.777 --> 29:58.895
Her dads are doing something
called sitting shivah.

29:58.946 --> 30:02.065
I mean... I just don't get it.

30:02.116 --> 30:04.701
It was a total choke.

30:04.752 --> 30:06.286
Okay. (sighs)

30:06.371 --> 30:09.256
So, let's hop on back
to sunny Spain.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.008
Hey, look, here's a fun fact:

30:11.075 --> 30:13.377
Spain is considered
a mostly mountainous country,

30:13.428 --> 30:15.629
interspersed
with picturesque plateaus

30:15.713 --> 30:17.130
and arid valleys.
That's fascinating.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.932
No, it's not.
Who the hell cares?

30:19.017 --> 30:21.018
Not even Einstein
uses this crap.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.687
So wipe it from your memory
tomorrow, after your test.

30:23.754 --> 30:25.305
FINN:
Now, for the bonus round.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.691
Which region of Spain
receives the most rainfall?

30:27.758 --> 30:29.526
I don't know. You do.
Just think about it, dude.

30:29.593 --> 30:31.928
The rain in Spain
falls mainly...

30:31.996 --> 30:33.530
Whatever. In the flatlands.

30:33.597 --> 30:35.765
The plains.
What was that?

30:35.817 --> 30:38.485
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

Okay.

32:02.153 --> 32:04.204
Moving on.

32:04.288 --> 32:06.790
What rhymes with "preindustrial
European deforestation"?

32:06.857 --> 32:07.991
(sighs)
Anybody?

32:14.750 --> 32:17.252
Shannon,
I'm very upset with you.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.588
You promised to stay
the night at my house.

32:19.639 --> 32:21.456
I made up my sofa bed for you.

32:21.576 --> 32:23.776
I ruined my tent fashioning
a neck hole in it.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.760
And what am I supposed
to do with those

32:25.812 --> 32:27.262
nine whole chickens
in my fridge?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.947
I'm sorry, Sue.
I forgot to call you.

32:29.032 --> 32:30.265
But I'm okay.

32:31.618 --> 32:33.118
I spent all last night

32:33.203 --> 32:35.037
moving in with my sister,
Denise.

32:35.104 --> 32:36.905
Your sister's name
is Denise Beiste?

32:38.575 --> 32:40.542
Well, Coach, I'm glad to hear
that you're okay.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.628
And I hope that whatever bridge

32:42.712 --> 32:44.129
Denise Beiste lives under
is nice and cozy.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.169
Beiste, I really admire
what you're doing.

32:50.253 --> 32:52.888
I know how difficult it must be.

32:54.224 --> 32:57.059
Not as difficult
as what I'm about to do.

32:57.126 --> 32:59.794
(school bell ringing)

32:59.846 --> 33:03.899
BEISTE: Girls, I have
a confession to make.

33:05.185 --> 33:07.436
It's a really hard thing
to talk about,

33:07.487 --> 33:10.489
but I feel like
I owe it to you.

33:10.573 --> 33:13.242
I didn't get hit
by a punching bag.

33:13.309 --> 33:15.110
I got hit by my husband.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.978
Are you serious?

33:17.030 --> 33:18.780
Did he break his hand?

33:18.832 --> 33:20.582
I'm sorry I lied
to you about it.

33:22.118 --> 33:24.369
But nobody tells you
what you're supposed to do

33:24.454 --> 33:25.420
when something
like this happens.

33:25.488 --> 33:27.673
I was shocked,

33:27.757 --> 33:29.758
I was... ashamed.

33:29.825 --> 33:32.094
So I made excuses for myself,

33:32.161 --> 33:34.463
to make it okay.

33:34.514 --> 33:36.064
And I heard you girls say that

33:36.132 --> 33:37.516
you thought your boyfriends
would never

33:37.584 --> 33:39.952
do anything to you like that.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.771
And a week ago, I would've said

33:42.838 --> 33:44.139
exactly the same thing.

33:45.508 --> 33:46.525
And I was wrong.

33:48.094 --> 33:52.364
But Cooter always seemed
like such a nice guy.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.700
Yeah, I always just thought he
was a big, smiley doofus.

33:54.784 --> 33:57.452
He is. Most of the time.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.489
But nobody knows what
goes on behind closed doors.

34:00.557 --> 34:02.507
Are you considering
pressing charges?

34:02.575 --> 34:04.409
Yeah.

34:05.962 --> 34:08.130
And more than that,
I got out of there,

34:08.197 --> 34:09.630
and I moved in with my sister,

34:09.699 --> 34:12.367
and that feels really good.

34:13.536 --> 34:15.387
But you girls?

34:16.973 --> 34:20.475
You not only opened
my eyes to this...

34:20.543 --> 34:22.377
you maybe even saved my life.

34:25.514 --> 34:27.349
Thank you.

34:30.687 --> 34:32.437
(sniffs)

34:46.199 --> 34:48.237
Eyes on your paper, Puckerman.

34:51.456 --> 34:54.092

'Cause sometimes after
I take a test, my head hurts.

35:44.976 --> 35:46.177
It's usually a good sign.

35:46.261 --> 35:48.646
You know, it's weird,
but... I think I did.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.347
Thanks to you guys.

35:50.432 --> 35:53.317
So thank you.
All of you.

35:53.401 --> 35:55.653
You know, it's hard
growing up without a dad,

35:55.737 --> 35:57.855
because you don't have
any dude role models,

35:57.939 --> 35:59.690
except NFL players and
video game characters.

35:59.774 --> 36:02.776
But I lucked out because
instead of one dad,

36:02.828 --> 36:04.712
I got a whole gang of them.

36:04.832 --> 36:07.024
You guys showed me what
it means to be a man.

36:07.144 --> 36:10.501
Not just last night,
but for four years.

36:10.585 --> 36:11.836
Even you, Blaine.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.038
Thanks?
Let's hug it out.

36:14.122 --> 36:16.173
Aw, yeah.
Bring it in, guys.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.374
On hand.
All the time.

36:25.256 --> 36:27.107
You girls wanted to see me?

36:27.956 --> 36:30.031
We wanted the chance to say
that we're sorry,

36:30.151 --> 36:31.281
and we had no idea.

36:31.404 --> 36:33.522
No idea that this
was really happening

36:33.606 --> 36:35.441

36:35.492 --> 36:36.775

36:36.826 --> 36:38.160

39:59.195 --> 40:00.812
You killed the beginning
of that song.

40:00.863 --> 40:02.948
I-I wouldn't be surprised if
you got accepted just from that.

40:03.015 --> 40:05.353
Kurt, I really appreciate what
you're trying to do, but...

40:06.953 --> 40:08.687
we both know what happened.

40:08.738 --> 40:11.540
All right? I had my chance,
and I choked.

40:11.624 --> 40:14.159
I choked on a song that I've
been singing my entire life.

40:14.210 --> 40:16.628
And now it's over, and there's
no one to blame but me.

40:18.831 --> 40:21.533
You were amazing, though.

40:21.584 --> 40:24.419
You were. I mean,
you went with your gut,

40:24.504 --> 40:27.539
and-and you were better
than you've ever been.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.841
You and Finn are gonna be
great in New York together.

40:29.892 --> 40:31.426
Well, you're coming, too.

40:31.511 --> 40:33.378
Of course you're coming.

40:33.429 --> 40:35.430
Even if it doesn't work out
with NYADA, you'll find...

40:35.515 --> 40:37.933
Could we just not talk about
this anymore, please?

40:38.017 --> 40:39.217
It's just... I haven't...

40:39.269 --> 40:40.885
I haven't slept
in like two days,

40:40.937 --> 40:42.938
and I just am tired really tired
of talking about it, okay?

40:49.579 --> 40:52.171
I love you, Rachel Berry.

40:54.867 --> 40:56.752
I love you, too.
