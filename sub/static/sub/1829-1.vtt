32:53.203 --> 32:54.671
My word.

32:54.704 --> 32:55.703
All right.

32:57.437 --> 32:59.071
That's right.

32:59.104 --> 33:01.038
This is the stupidest
thing I've ever seen.

33:01.071 --> 33:03.006
He violated me.
Tully, he violated me.

33:03.039 --> 33:04.339
He had his hands all over me.

33:04.372 --> 33:05.971
He didn't touch her.
He didn't touch her.

33:05.995 --> 33:06.906
He did!

33:06.939 --> 33:07.938
Yes, he did!

33:07.939 --> 33:09.207
[Baby crying]

Anthony!

33:10.407 --> 33:11.874
Anthony, baby?

33:11.907 --> 33:13.375
Anthony.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.941
Anthony, no!

33:14.974 --> 33:16.208

[Crying]

33:22.710 --> 33:24.143
He ain't fuckin' dead, is he?

33:24.176 --> 33:25.310
Come on.

33:29.110 --> 33:30.311
Fuck.

33:30.344 --> 33:31.343
Okay.

33:31.344 --> 33:33.012
- Okay.
- All right.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.712
He is not fucking dead.

33:34.745 --> 33:35.944
That isn't
the fucking problem.

33:35.968 --> 33:37.178
You almost got me killed.

33:37.211 --> 33:39.312
Nobody fucking talks
to me that way, you understand.

33:39.345 --> 33:41.145
Least of all you.

33:41.178 --> 33:43.013
Shit.

33:43.046 --> 33:44.213
[Gasps]

- ODESSA: Just rest, my baby.

34:04.528 --> 34:05.784

[Odessa sighs]

34:09.784 --> 34:11.985
What?
Is he okay?

34:12.018 --> 34:16.219
You gave your brother up,
you little bitch.

34:16.252 --> 34:19.085
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

34:19.119 --> 34:21.654
My God, I got two babies.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.820
[Sighs] And I told you
not to have them.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.721
- This is not...
- But you had them anyway, didn't you?

34:25.754 --> 34:27.255
- You had them, anyway.
- my fault!

34:27.288 --> 34:28.288
None of it.

34:28.321 --> 34:30.022
I'm tired of you

34:30.054 --> 34:33.056
blaming me for everything,
and this is not my fault.

34:33.089 --> 34:34.690
You don't do that.

34:34.723 --> 34:36.657
You don't give
your brother up, baby.

34:36.690 --> 34:38.023
- Mom...
- You don't, ever.

34:38.056 --> 34:39.857
- Mother.
- Give your brother up.

34:39.889 --> 34:41.024
- Never!
- What was I

34:41.056 --> 34:42.657
- supposed to do?
- Ever, ever.

[Muffled yelling
over each other]

Unzip your pants.

35:01.460 --> 35:02.460
What?

35:04.995 --> 35:06.762
I said, unzip your pants.

35:11.395 --> 35:12.395
[zipper unzips]

35:16.197 --> 35:17.431
It's okay.

35:17.464 --> 35:19.431
I'm just gonna
do what I do best.

35:19.464 --> 35:21.398
Yeah.

35:21.431 --> 35:23.799
You deserve this.

You like this?

35:34.333 --> 35:36.135
- Doreen?
- You like this?

35:38.368 --> 35:39.801
What do I got to do

35:39.834 --> 35:42.035
to get you hard?
I have to talk a little bit?

35:42.068 --> 35:43.869
Huh?
I can talk.

35:45.735 --> 35:47.902
Baby, what's it take
to get you hard?

35:47.935 --> 35:50.336
You just tell me,
I'll do it for you.

Okay, look.

35:53.804 --> 35:55.171
That's enough.

35:57.770 --> 35:59.729
It's like a fucking record.
What's wrong with you?

35:59.753 --> 36:01.439
[Tully sighs]

36:01.472 --> 36:04.873
White men are the nuts
and bolts of society.

36:04.906 --> 36:07.140
And their warriors
must be as strong

36:07.173 --> 36:08.874
and pure as their philosophy.

36:10.140 --> 36:11.408
What the fuck does that mean?

36:11.441 --> 36:13.341
It means you
sacrifice your petty needs

36:13.374 --> 36:15.532
and desires for something
more important than yourself.

36:15.556 --> 36:17.275
Something bigger,
you understand?

36:17.308 --> 36:19.275
What, did you say that?

36:19.308 --> 36:20.843
No, Sobecki did.

36:23.943 --> 36:25.877
Sobecki said that.

36:27.843 --> 36:28.978
Of course he did.

36:29.011 --> 36:32.178
[Sighs, chuckles]

36:32.211 --> 36:37.680
Well, I guess that means
prison done turned you gay.

36:40.279 --> 36:41.679
Fuck!

36:41.712 --> 36:42.846
Don't you ever fucking

36:42.878 --> 36:44.179

you understand me,

36:44.212 --> 36:45.780
you fucking bitch,
don't you ever!

Get off of me.

Don't you ever fucking talk to
me or grab me like that again.

You hear me?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.416
Don't fucking touch me again.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.416

Let's just drive, okay?

37:11.051 --> 37:13.209
- Let's just fucking drive.
- Don't tell me what to do.

37:18.486 --> 37:20.920
ODESSA: Everybody told
you not to have them.

37:20.953 --> 37:22.337
[Yelling in the background]

37:22.338 --> 37:23.721
Tully. Tully.

37:23.754 --> 37:24.888
Listen to me.

37:24.921 --> 37:26.355
We need to do
what Sobecki said.

37:26.388 --> 37:28.255
And just slit their throat.

37:28.288 --> 37:30.022
- Just slit their throat.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

37:30.055 --> 37:31.322
- Use your brain.
- Listen to me, listen to me.

37:31.355 --> 37:33.022
You gotta be
a man right now for me.

37:33.055 --> 37:34.256
You have got to do something.

37:34.289 --> 37:36.223
Be a fucking Aryan.

37:36.256 --> 37:37.724
Use your fucking brain.

37:37.757 --> 37:39.424
They're more
valuable to us alive.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.424
To who?

37:41.457 --> 37:44.457
Jesus Christ, you don't think we
work with their kind on the inside?

37:44.490 --> 37:46.425
- This is...
- Business is fucking business.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.958
We are
on the outside right now.

37:48.991 --> 37:52.926
We are on the outside. And on the
outside, you do them before they do you.

37:52.959 --> 37:55.260
That is the fucking business.

37:55.293 --> 37:56.917
Fucking... If you're
so fucking game,

37:56.942 --> 37:58.927
why don't you start with
the baby in the crib?

37:58.960 --> 38:00.027
You are not getting it.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.361
You-You need to do this.

38:01.394 --> 38:02.728
You have got to do this.

38:02.761 --> 38:04.095
And the baby?
Why shoot the baby?

38:04.128 --> 38:05.806
- The baby can't fucking even talk.
- Fine.

38:05.830 --> 38:06.989
Fuck it, the little boy then.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.753
- He's seen our faces, start with him.
- Shh!

38:13.730 --> 38:16.364
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

38:16.397 --> 38:18.731
Fine. I will.

38:22.465 --> 38:23.932
Oh, fu...

38:30.266 --> 38:32.434
How he's doin'?

38:32.467 --> 38:33.901
He's gonna be okay?

38:36.835 --> 38:38.069
[Sighs]

38:38.102 --> 38:40.302
I just...
I wanna apologize.

38:40.335 --> 38:41.369
Um...

38:42.435 --> 38:43.768
I'm real sorry.

38:43.801 --> 38:45.835
About what I said.

38:45.868 --> 38:46.968
Because, um...

38:47.001 --> 38:48.335
sometimes you just get into

38:48.368 --> 38:50.270
this kind of dilemma,
and things come out,

38:50.303 --> 38:52.181
you don't really...
you don't-don't really know,

38:52.205 --> 38:54.304
and I really...
I want to apologize for that.

38:54.337 --> 38:56.471
We-We all...
We all need to stick together.

38:56.504 --> 38:58.471
Because he...

38:58.504 --> 39:02.906
He's real unpredictable, you
know what I mean? I'm scared.

39:02.939 --> 39:06.006
I'm freezing, I'm hungry,
I just want to go home.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.506
I'm hungry too, Mommy.

39:07.507 --> 39:08.973
I know, baby.

39:09.006 --> 39:10.107
You're hungry?

39:11.507 --> 39:13.441
I'm hungry.

39:13.474 --> 39:15.808

get some food with me?

- No.
- [Chuckles]

39:17.775 --> 39:19.109
You just said you were hungry.

39:19.142 --> 39:20.809
I'm hungry, too.
It's okay.

39:20.842 --> 39:22.309
You want to go

39:22.342 --> 39:24.310
in the kitchen with me
and help me find some food,

39:24.343 --> 39:26.542
something to make, like, a
peanut butter and jelly with.

39:26.566 --> 39:27.110
No.

39:27.143 --> 39:29.044
It'll be fun. You and me, we're
gonna go make peanut butter...

39:29.077 --> 39:30.811
- No. He ain't goin' with you.
- He ain't goin'.

39:30.844 --> 39:32.643
- The boy stays with his mother.
- Go to hell.

39:32.676 --> 39:34.914

to me, you understand?

41:32.433 --> 41:35.000
away from me, though.
That's the...

away from you?

41:39.068 --> 41:41.902
The-The-The government.

The social workers

41:43.202 --> 41:44.437
and police.

No, baby.

No, that's crazy talk.

41:56.937 --> 41:59.138
What do you
know about death, anyway?

41:59.171 --> 42:02.439

they go to heaven.

I know you do.

47:51.337 --> 47:53.205
'Cause you're black.

47:53.238 --> 47:56.238
All y'all love
yourselves some God.

48:02.839 --> 48:06.106
I feel like
God is fucking with me.

48:08.906 --> 48:10.808
I feel like he has

48:10.841 --> 48:12.508

And then there's me.
[Chuckles]

48:19.409 --> 48:21.009
That's crazy, right?

48:22.876 --> 48:27.077
What-What if God,
when he talks to you,

48:27.110 --> 48:31.178
you can't hear because you don't
understand what he's saying?

48:34.378 --> 48:35.946
What do you do then?

48:39.879 --> 48:41.847
'Cause see, I'm confused.

48:41.880 --> 48:44.181
I'm fucking confused.

48:48.981 --> 48:51.282
I'm confused as to why

48:51.315 --> 48:53.183
your name
is Odessa because that...

48:53.216 --> 48:54.575
[Chuckling]
is a white girl's name.

48:54.583 --> 48:57.049
That is a fucking
white girl's name.

48:57.082 --> 48:59.120
'Cause I went to school
with an Odessa and that girl

48:59.144 --> 49:01.245
was the whitest
girl you ever saw.

yourself a pretty black name.

forget about us.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.312
Who?

01:00:34.345 --> 01:00:36.743
- You got the wrong number.
- What do you mean, wrong number?

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:38.446
This is, this is Doreen.
I talked to you.

01:00:38.479 --> 01:00:41.197
You told me last night you all were
comin' here and you were gonna...

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.547
You got the wrong number.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:44.418
- Doreen. This is Doreen.
- I'm hanging up now.

01:00:44.442 --> 01:00:45.415
And you... Hel-Hello?

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:46.648
[Dial tone]

01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:49.515
Hello? Fuck.

01:00:49.548 --> 01:00:51.249
[Whispering]
Oh my God. Fuck me.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.950
Well?

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.216
Well? What do you
fucking think, well?

01:00:55.249 --> 01:00:56.543
He acted like he didn't
even fucking know me.

01:00:56.568 --> 01:00:57.583
What do you think
he's gonna do?

01:00:57.616 --> 01:01:00.454
Jeopardize the whole goddamn word
for a two-bit fucking skank like you?

01:01:00.478 --> 01:01:01.351
That's really

01:01:01.384 --> 01:01:03.117
fucking nice
to say to me right now.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:05.118
What does that make you, huh?

01:01:05.151 --> 01:01:07.309
- What did I ever...
- You're still free to take a car.

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:08.686
Thank you so much.

01:01:08.719 --> 01:01:10.585
Considering there's
cops everywhere.

01:01:10.618 --> 01:01:12.720
That's a great idea.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.452
There's still another way.

01:01:16.653 --> 01:01:18.553
Go on.

01:01:18.586 --> 01:01:22.487
They got roads around here.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.955
Dozens of roads.

01:01:24.988 --> 01:01:28.722
Dirt roads connected
to private roads.

01:01:28.755 --> 01:01:31.323
I know every last one of them.

01:01:31.356 --> 01:01:34.157
Better than them.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:37.157
I don't think that that's
gonna work for us, Tully.

01:01:38.557 --> 01:01:39.691
[Exhales]

01:01:39.724 --> 01:01:41.625
I'm not talking about you.

01:01:41.658 --> 01:01:43.159
That'd be foolish.

01:01:44.258 --> 01:01:46.192
I'm talking about me.

01:01:46.225 --> 01:01:47.811
What, you're gonna
drive us out of here?

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:48.623
Give me a break.

01:01:48.656 --> 01:01:50.060
No, sir.

01:01:51.259 --> 01:01:53.427
I go alone.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.727
DOREEN:
You're crazy.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.094
I take you,

01:01:57.427 --> 01:02:00.195
and we hit one roadblock,

01:02:00.228 --> 01:02:02.663
and they see us
turn around, it's all over.

01:02:04.162 --> 01:02:07.363
But an old black man...

01:02:09.063 --> 01:02:12.464
drivin' a rusty automobile,

01:02:12.497 --> 01:02:14.299
they don't pay it much mind.

01:02:18.497 --> 01:02:21.165
Tell me you're not
really believing this bullshit.

01:02:21.198 --> 01:02:23.298
And if you don't return?

01:02:23.331 --> 01:02:25.700
Or you bring back the law?

01:02:25.733 --> 01:02:26.732
Yeah?

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.100
You need more collateral?

01:02:34.067 --> 01:02:35.468
I ain't got it.

01:02:37.067 --> 01:02:38.635
Tully.

01:02:38.668 --> 01:02:41.336
Tully, please tell me
you are not buyin' into this.

01:02:46.003 --> 01:02:47.637
Fuck it,
you got a better plan?

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:50.438
Not yet.

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:55.205
Here's what I'll do.

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:59.073
I'll get gas.

01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:00.540
I'll get groceries.

01:03:00.573 --> 01:03:02.606
I'll empty out
my bank account.

01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:04.641
Not bad.

01:03:04.673 --> 01:03:07.374
$6,000 and some change.

01:03:07.407 --> 01:03:08.708
And a map out of here.

01:03:08.741 --> 01:03:10.508
Listen to me.

01:03:10.541 --> 01:03:14.742
Do not let this
nigger hustle us right now.

01:03:14.775 --> 01:03:17.142
Baby, we got to think.

01:03:17.175 --> 01:03:18.675
We just lost our only shot.

01:03:18.708 --> 01:03:20.309
We gotta come up
with a better plan.

01:03:20.342 --> 01:03:22.043
Do you understand me?
This is not it.

01:03:22.076 --> 01:03:26.077
Him sittin' there
talkin' is not it.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:27.577
Come on.

01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:29.545
No, not this old man.

01:03:29.578 --> 01:03:31.278
Because if he does...

01:03:33.112 --> 01:03:36.579
I will fuck everyone
in this house and he knows it.

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:38.113
He ain't dumb.

01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:40.246
Something goes wrong,
and you come back

01:03:40.279 --> 01:03:42.714
to a heap of bodies,
you understand?

01:03:42.747 --> 01:03:44.081
MR. WALKER:
Understood.

01:03:46.014 --> 01:03:48.449
I'm not leaving, unless...

01:03:48.482 --> 01:03:49.782
DOREEN:
Unless what?

01:03:49.783 --> 01:03:51.082
Anthony comes with me.

01:03:51.115 --> 01:03:52.415
I don't fucking think so.

01:03:52.448 --> 01:03:54.183
Fuck you.
This is a stupid fucking plan.

01:03:54.216 --> 01:03:55.616
Tully, look at me right now.

01:03:55.649 --> 01:03:58.150
He is fucking niggering you.

01:03:58.183 --> 01:04:01.417
You are getting
hustled by a fucking nigger.

01:04:01.450 --> 01:04:03.452
He comes,

01:04:03.485 --> 01:04:04.985
or I don't go.

01:04:07.418 --> 01:04:08.652
No, no, no.

01:04:08.685 --> 01:04:11.553
There is no struggle here.

01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:14.137
Look at this fucking black
man telling you what to do.

01:04:14.162 --> 01:04:14.987
Shut up.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.321
Fuck, Tully!

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.653
All right.

You're on.

Hey.

Hey, you gotta learn.

01:04:55.193 --> 01:04:56.728
You fight with your mind.

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.028
Yes, sir.

01:05:00.061 --> 01:05:01.061
Okay?

01:05:02.295 --> 01:05:04.596
Okay, son, you did good.

01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:05.697
All right.

01:05:07.796 --> 01:05:09.364
I'm proud of you.

01:05:12.364 --> 01:05:13.498
I am.

01:05:13.531 --> 01:05:14.665
Okay.

[LT. HANNITY: We got
roadblocks on every major

There's been no reports
on any stolen cars.

These guys are still here.

report, we'll be good.

We should get on to my house.

They gotta be
in one of these houses.

I'm fine checking it out.

around the side?

It's funny, I just saw my dad

driving down the road.
Did he tell you I called?

No, he-he doesn't
tell me much.

01:06:43.313 --> 01:06:44.348
Huh.

01:06:46.081 --> 01:06:48.048
The reason why
I'm here is that

01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:49.749
there's been a murder.

01:06:49.782 --> 01:06:51.166

01:06:51.167 --> 01:06:52.549
What happened?

has been killed.

Well, um...

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.585
It would make me feel
really comfortable,

01:07:02.618 --> 01:07:07.285
if you just allow me to come
and just take a little browse.

gonna get in the middle

it being my house.

01:10:47.659 --> 01:10:49.793
Okay, this is, um...

01:10:49.826 --> 01:10:51.226
Besides drivin' too slow,

01:10:51.259 --> 01:10:52.727
was I doin'
anything else wrong?

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.794
I got these.
[Sniffs]

01:10:54.827 --> 01:10:56.628
We're in a little
bit of a rush.

01:10:56.661 --> 01:10:58.362
I'm tryin' to get
him to his mom.

01:10:58.395 --> 01:10:59.562
She's not feelin' so good.

01:10:59.595 --> 01:11:00.874
Drivin' slow
for being in a rush.

01:11:00.898 --> 01:11:02.495
I know,
it's the glasses thing.

01:11:02.528 --> 01:11:04.296
They... I, it's real
hard for me to see.

01:11:04.329 --> 01:11:06.329
It's for safety
purposes, you know.

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.264
- Can I see your license, please?
- Oh, right.

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.230
This is, this is my license.

01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:12.364
Terrible picture.
What is it with that, right?

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:14.365
Licenses,
you get the worst photos.

01:11:14.398 --> 01:11:15.432
- Thank you.
- Yup.

01:11:15.465 --> 01:11:17.099
- Wait here, please.
- Sure.

01:11:17.132 --> 01:11:19.033
Absolutely.
Thank you.

01:11:21.332 --> 01:11:23.733
TULLY:
That was real fucking smart.

01:11:23.766 --> 01:11:25.400
[Sighs]

01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:27.134
- The fuck were you doin', anyway?
- [Radio chatter]

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:28.406
DOREEN:
I was manipulating him.

01:11:28.433 --> 01:11:30.267
Trying to get him
to like, you know.

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.333
You must have been doin'
somethin' for him to turn

01:11:32.366 --> 01:11:34.768
- the fucking lights on.
- Did you hear what you're sayin'?

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.580
I'm fucking slow.

01:11:35.605 --> 01:11:37.918
Fucking clack cops, thinkin'
they got somethin' to prove.

01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:39.136
Okay, just chill.

01:11:41.368 --> 01:11:42.402
We're all good?

01:11:42.435 --> 01:11:43.437
Your name, sir?

01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:46.203
Tully.

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:48.337
Full name?

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:49.805
Man, I didn't
do nothin' wrong.

01:11:49.837 --> 01:11:51.638
Nobody said you did.

01:11:51.671 --> 01:11:53.539
Then you don't need my name.

01:11:55.638 --> 01:11:57.439
May I see
your identification, please?

01:11:59.272 --> 01:12:01.106
I know my rights.

01:12:01.139 --> 01:12:03.807
Tully, he's just,
he's just askin' for your...

01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:06.641
What? He's just pullin'
rank for no reason.

01:12:06.674 --> 01:12:08.741
No, he's not.
He's just...

01:12:08.774 --> 01:12:11.775
I need to see your driver's license
or form of identification.

01:12:11.808 --> 01:12:14.176
She gave you
her license, all right?

01:12:14.209 --> 01:12:16.476
Everything's in order.
We weren't speedin' or nothin'.

01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:18.707
- Just back off...
- I'm going to ask you one more time.

01:12:18.731 --> 01:12:19.677
I need to see your I.D.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.710
Please.

01:12:20.743 --> 01:12:22.178
I told you.

01:12:22.211 --> 01:12:25.778
I didn't do nothin' wrong.

01:12:25.811 --> 01:12:26.979
He's just in a mood.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.146
Excuse me.

01:12:30.111 --> 01:12:31.745
You need to step
out of the vehicle.

01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:35.646
No, you stay put.

01:12:37.246 --> 01:12:39.313
Step out of the vehicle, now.

01:12:42.147 --> 01:12:44.481
You hear me talking to you.

01:12:44.514 --> 01:12:46.215
- Please.
- That's how you want to play it?

01:12:46.247 --> 01:12:47.498
Sir, he's...

01:12:47.499 --> 01:12:48.748
[Static]

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:50.465
This is Deputy Rivers. I'm on...

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.149
Get on your fucking

01:12:52.182 --> 01:12:53.740

01:13:02.684 --> 01:13:03.719
We can work this...

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:04.752
Shut the fuck up.

01:13:04.785 --> 01:13:07.119
- Fucking cops, you're all the same.
- Hey, you don't need to do this.

01:13:07.152 --> 01:13:09.911
You say you want to help us, and then
you stab us in the fucking back.

01:13:09.935 --> 01:13:11.733
I seen it every day.
It makes me fucking sick.

01:13:11.753 --> 01:13:12.586
Put the gun down.

01:13:12.619 --> 01:13:14.087

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:15.319

That's not gonna happen.

01:17:21.232 --> 01:17:22.867
If you're gonna kill me...

01:17:24.499 --> 01:17:26.434

01:29:22.932 --> 01:29:24.667
Doreen!

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.867
Don't fucking move.

01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:29.668
Jesus Christ,
what the fuck, Doreen?

01:29:29.701 --> 01:29:31.269
What?

01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:35.335
What?

01:29:35.368 --> 01:29:36.836
Whose is that fucking money?

01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:40.470
What-What money?

01:29:40.503 --> 01:29:42.870
Who's goddamn money is that?

01:29:42.903 --> 01:29:45.671
This my money.

01:29:45.704 --> 01:29:49.572
It's my money. This is the money
for the lawyer for my baby.

01:29:49.605 --> 01:29:51.572
You cannot have this money.

01:29:53.038 --> 01:29:54.439
[Phone ringing]

01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:55.839
It's my money.

01:29:57.739 --> 01:30:02.040
[Ringing continues]

01:30:02.073 --> 01:30:04.241
You dumb fucking bitch.

01:30:11.342 --> 01:30:12.842
It's my money.

01:30:15.909 --> 01:30:17.510
It's my money.

01:30:20.810 --> 01:30:22.578
Hello?

01:30:22.611 --> 01:30:25.478
Hello, hello,
hello, hello, hel...

01:30:27.911 --> 01:30:30.545
You tryin' Jew me, Goldberg?

01:30:30.578 --> 01:30:32.380
Hey, Tully, Tully.

01:30:32.413 --> 01:30:33.547
Tully, you there?

01:30:34.680 --> 01:30:35.880
Where's Sobecki?

01:30:37.047 --> 01:30:38.681
Hey, we're connecting the call.

01:30:38.714 --> 01:30:39.914
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:30:39.947 --> 01:30:42.249
Find him.
I ain't got all goddamn day.

01:31:21.954 --> 01:31:23.756
What the fuck are you doin'?

01:31:27.723 --> 01:31:30.491
Doreen, they will fucking
kill you, you understand?

01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:33.424
They will fucking shoot you.

01:31:33.457 --> 01:31:35.325
Shit.

01:31:35.358 --> 01:31:37.993
Doreen, get down.
What the fuck are you doin'?

01:31:54.961 --> 01:31:56.995
Doreen, where
the fuck are you goin'?

01:32:00.095 --> 01:32:03.396
What are you
going to tell Sobecki?

01:32:03.429 --> 01:32:04.896
That you killed me?

01:32:04.929 --> 01:32:07.397
That you let a bunch
of niggers leave?

01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:08.497
What about the AB?

01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:10.265
The Cause?

01:32:11.364 --> 01:32:13.298
It's a joke.

01:32:16.632 --> 01:32:17.766
I need you.

01:32:17.799 --> 01:32:19.400
It's a joke.

01:32:19.432 --> 01:32:21.600
Don't you fucking
walk out on me, Doreen.

01:32:21.633 --> 01:32:24.334
You will fucking
die out there.

01:32:24.367 --> 01:32:26.534
Help me. Help me.

01:32:28.834 --> 01:32:31.769
Doreen, don't you
fucking do this.

01:32:31.802 --> 01:32:33.469
I have to.

01:32:42.637 --> 01:32:44.371
Please don't shoot.

01:32:44.404 --> 01:32:46.705
Please don't shoot,
I'm a hostage.

01:32:46.738 --> 01:32:49.505
What the fuck? Doreen!

Please don't shoot, okay?
I'm a hostage.

- Don't shoot me. I didn't do anything.
- Get on your knees, now.

01:33:17.609 --> 01:33:19.844
Is that the phone
that stinks or your hand?

01:33:21.811 --> 01:33:23.344
Hello? Tully.

01:33:24.478 --> 01:33:25.878
Sir.

01:33:25.911 --> 01:33:27.478
It's you, isn't it?

01:33:27.511 --> 01:33:28.979
Yes, Paul, it's me.

01:33:30.612 --> 01:33:32.713
It's a big mistake, calling.

01:33:32.746 --> 01:33:34.680
Doreen?

01:33:34.713 --> 01:33:36.814
She fucking walked out, man.

01:33:36.847 --> 01:33:38.048
Straight into their arms.

01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:39.781
She's a fucking traitor.

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.948
She's probably
a nigger-fucker, too.

01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:43.049
Paul.

01:33:43.082 --> 01:33:45.616
I did not kill that cop.

01:33:45.649 --> 01:33:47.582
That motherfucker
tried to get me.

01:33:47.615 --> 01:33:49.550
You know what they're like.

01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:51.850
[Clears throat] Okay, what
do you want me to do?

01:33:51.883 --> 01:33:54.418
I don't know,
I don't know, just...

01:33:54.451 --> 01:33:55.752
Tell the screws to let you go.

01:33:58.917 --> 01:34:01.384
Fuck, man.
Just give me the word

01:34:01.417 --> 01:34:03.096
and I will kill
every fucker in this house.

01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:05.052
That's all I ask,
just give me the word.

01:34:05.085 --> 01:34:08.053
My word, with half
the FBI listening?

01:34:08.086 --> 01:34:11.486
I got fucking
hostages here, Paul.

01:34:11.519 --> 01:34:13.887
I've been out of jail
for 24 fucking hours,

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.987
I am not going back.

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.621
You ain't got dick!

01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:20.755
You ain't got dick.

01:34:20.788 --> 01:34:22.455
You got a house
full of porch monkeys,

01:34:22.488 --> 01:34:24.590
I got hemorrhoids, and neither
is doing us any good.

01:34:25.989 --> 01:34:27.923
You listen.

01:34:27.956 --> 01:34:30.657
Last time I talked, you were supposed
to take care of Bakersfield.

01:34:30.690 --> 01:34:32.058
You did not do that.

01:34:32.091 --> 01:34:34.791
Now...

01:34:34.824 --> 01:34:36.525
I got the Sureños
coming after me.

01:34:36.558 --> 01:34:38.197
You think I want
to mess with those spics?

01:34:38.221 --> 01:34:39.392
I fucked up.

01:34:39.425 --> 01:34:41.726
I don't know what to do.
Just help-help me.

01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:43.559
No. No, no, no.

01:34:46.093 --> 01:34:47.460
Here's my help.

01:34:49.527 --> 01:34:51.062
You gotta go south on this.

01:34:51.094 --> 01:34:52.795
I ain't surrenderin', Paul.

01:34:52.828 --> 01:34:55.462
I ain't fuckin'
goin' back to jail.

01:34:55.495 --> 01:34:58.029
You are going
to do as they say.

01:34:58.062 --> 01:34:59.862
I ain't fuckin' surrenderin'.

01:34:59.895 --> 01:35:01.562
- I ain't surrenderin'.
- Don't. Shh, hey.

01:35:01.595 --> 01:35:03.079
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

01:35:03.080 --> 01:35:04.563
I ain't surrenderin'.

01:35:04.596 --> 01:35:06.797
Hey.

01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:08.069
What's the white man do,
Tully?

01:35:08.097 --> 01:35:10.831
What's a white man do, Tully?

01:35:10.864 --> 01:35:12.931
He brings the bolts down.

01:35:12.964 --> 01:35:14.832
Now, right now
the bolts for you

01:35:14.865 --> 01:35:17.498
are walking out of that house
with both hands over your head.

01:35:17.531 --> 01:35:20.599
If I come back to jail, Paul,
what's gonna happen to me?

01:35:20.632 --> 01:35:22.067
Am I gonna be safe?

01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:23.866
Let me hear you guarantee it.

01:35:23.899 --> 01:35:26.367
- I did 15 fucking years for you, Paul.
- Tully. Listen to me.

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.701
Fifteen fucking years.
Tell me I'll be safe.

01:35:28.734 --> 01:35:31.468
Do you hear what
I'm sayin' to you, Paul?

01:35:31.501 --> 01:35:34.102
This ain't
no fuckin' Armageddon.

01:35:34.135 --> 01:35:35.869
It's a business.

01:35:35.902 --> 01:35:37.370
And you're out of it.

I need your fucking
help right now.

Don't leave me here, Paul.

01:35:42.570 --> 01:35:44.809
All right, they're-they're callin' me.
Tully, I gotta go.

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:46.371
Wait, Paul.

01:35:46.404 --> 01:35:47.604
Paul, don't.

01:35:47.637 --> 01:35:49.005
- See you soon.
- Paul.

01:35:49.038 --> 01:35:51.639
Fuck. Paul.

Paul, I did
15 fucking years for you!

01:35:53.324 --> 01:35:54.974
It's done, hang the fuck up.

01:35:58.374 --> 01:36:00.074
To dawn, motherfucker.

01:36:03.574 --> 01:36:06.641
Fuck you. Don't you fucking
leave me, motherfucker.

- [Objects crashing]
- Fuck!

01:36:08.508 --> 01:36:10.075
You're a fucking dead man!

01:36:10.108 --> 01:36:11.742
You're fucking dead.

01:36:14.576 --> 01:36:16.710
I'm not gonna beg

01:36:16.743 --> 01:36:17.977
for my life.

01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:26.046
I'm not gonna beg for my life.

01:36:32.979 --> 01:36:34.980
What is it, Tully?

01:36:35.013 --> 01:36:36.413
Huh?

01:36:36.446 --> 01:36:37.814
My skin?

01:36:40.081 --> 01:36:41.682
If it's my skin...

01:36:43.115 --> 01:36:45.482
killin' us won't save you.

01:36:45.515 --> 01:36:46.683
Hmm?

01:36:48.116 --> 01:36:49.684
But what if it is...

01:36:50.816 --> 01:36:52.784
something inside of you?

01:36:54.150 --> 01:36:56.984
Something pained
deep inside of you

01:36:57.017 --> 01:36:58.352
that you're fighting.

01:36:59.852 --> 01:37:01.585
Well, if it is,

01:37:01.618 --> 01:37:04.585
maybe we're fighting
the same fight.

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.618
We're in the same boat.

01:37:06.651 --> 01:37:09.753
I lost everything
and I ain't goin' back.

01:37:09.786 --> 01:37:12.887
You haven't lost everything.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:15.821
How?

01:37:17.121 --> 01:37:19.422
You haven't lost everything.

01:37:22.788 --> 01:37:24.956
You feel afraid?

01:37:24.989 --> 01:37:26.522
Yeah.

01:37:26.555 --> 01:37:27.890
You're afraid.

01:37:29.490 --> 01:37:31.091
You're afraid of the choice

01:37:31.124 --> 01:37:32.658
that you have.

01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:38.759
And right now,
the choice you have

01:37:38.792 --> 01:37:40.826
is to put that gun down.

01:37:42.393 --> 01:37:43.893
Right now.

01:37:43.926 --> 01:37:45.860
And we walk out of here.

01:37:48.093 --> 01:37:49.961
That's the choice you have.

01:37:49.994 --> 01:37:51.428
This is my fucking choice.

01:37:51.461 --> 01:37:53.095
And this is my choice.

01:37:53.128 --> 01:37:55.595
And at the end of the day, you'll
always be a fucking nigger.

01:37:55.628 --> 01:37:56.796
Yes. Nigger.

01:37:58.062 --> 01:38:00.097
Nigger.

01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:02.430
It always comes down to that.

01:38:10.563 --> 01:38:11.831
No.

01:38:11.832 --> 01:38:13.098
Always are.

01:38:13.131 --> 01:38:16.865
Always blaming
his circumstances

01:38:16.898 --> 01:38:19.066
as an excuse

01:38:19.099 --> 01:38:21.033
to get what he thinks

01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:22.701
he deserves, that nigger.

01:38:24.067 --> 01:38:26.401
Hell, that nigger

01:38:26.434 --> 01:38:30.735
doesn't think
about the future,

01:38:30.768 --> 01:38:32.535
tomorrow.

01:38:32.568 --> 01:38:35.702

about getting his

grabby... that nigger.

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:43.838
Yeah, that nigger.

01:38:43.871 --> 01:38:45.504
Huh?

01:38:45.537 --> 01:38:48.638
There's only one
nigger in this room,

01:38:48.671 --> 01:38:51.039
in this house.

01:38:51.072 --> 01:38:52.373
And that nigger is you.

01:38:54.939 --> 01:38:56.773
That nigger's you.

That nigger's you, Tully.

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:01.542
That nigger is you.

It's a wonderful world.

Come on, man.
It's okay.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.834
We're goin' in.
We gotta move now.

We're comin' out.

Raymond, you're here?

01:41:44.703 --> 01:41:47.172
Stand down,
my pop's comin' out.

01:41:47.204 --> 01:41:49.172
Ray?

01:41:49.205 --> 01:41:50.673
You there?

01:41:50.674 --> 01:41:52.140
Yeah, Pop, I'm right here.

01:41:52.173 --> 01:41:53.773
Tell them to back down.

01:41:55.673 --> 01:41:56.741
We're coming out.

01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:00.574
Okay? We...

01:42:00.607 --> 01:42:02.808
are coming out.

01:42:02.841 --> 01:42:04.175
Keep movin' forward.

01:42:04.208 --> 01:42:05.642
Don't shoot.

01:42:14.476 --> 01:42:17.044
Tully, turn to your right.

01:42:18.444 --> 01:42:19.544
Get down on your knees.

01:42:21.710 --> 01:42:24.478
Clasp your hands
behind your head.

01:42:24.511 --> 01:42:26.145
Hands clasped.
Stay right there.

01:42:34.146 --> 01:42:37.647
[Tully panting]

01:43:59.996 --> 01:44:01.463
Hey.

01:44:01.496 --> 01:44:02.680
Much obliged.

01:44:02.681 --> 01:44:03.863
It's all good, Dad.

01:44:03.896 --> 01:44:05.597
- [Sighs]
- It's all good.

01:44:05.630 --> 01:44:07.215
Mm.

01:44:07.216 --> 01:44:08.799
Love you.

01:44:08.831 --> 01:44:09.999
Love you.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.002
Got a lot of work
to do around here.

01:44:30.035 --> 01:44:31.535
Yeah, son?

01:44:42.837 --> 01:44:47.406
[Ticking slows]
