00:05.667 --> 00:07.001
I have cancer.

00:07.069 --> 00:09.103
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's pancreatic.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.372
Julian?

00:13.141 --> 00:16.361
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.

00:16.429 --> 00:18.022
I want to go out with you...

00:18.090 --> 00:19.301
On a date.

00:21.571 --> 00:23.030
- Excuse me.
- Are you Katie Ryan?

00:43.111 --> 00:44.217
What's his problem?

00:44.284 --> 00:46.737
Costume malfunction.

00:46.804 --> 00:48.615
I'm not coming out!

00:48.683 --> 00:50.120
This isn't funny, Josh!

00:50.188 --> 00:51.259
No, it's not!

00:51.327 --> 00:53.236
What's his deal?

00:53.304 --> 00:55.145
Maybe he wants to know why his director

00:55.213 --> 00:56.250
is an hour late to set.

00:56.318 --> 00:57.993
No sleep. Don't ask.

00:58.061 --> 00:59.265
Josh?!

00:59.332 --> 01:01.140
Get out here before I tell everybody

01:01.208 --> 01:03.920
who you went home with last Saturday.

01:08.637 --> 01:10.306
This is bull...

01:10.374 --> 01:11.647
Someone find...

01:11.715 --> 01:13.052
Brooke!

01:13.119 --> 01:14.859
What the hell is this?

01:14.926 --> 01:17.669
It's the jogging scene.
Is there a problem?

01:17.737 --> 01:19.506
The problem, Brooke,
is that my romantic lead

01:19.574 --> 01:23.520
looks like the love child of
Richard Simmons and a village person.

01:23.587 --> 01:25.059
Well...

01:25.127 --> 01:28.168
I guess I made a huge, stupid,

01:28.236 --> 01:30.041
unforgivable mistake.

01:30.109 --> 01:31.544
Imagine that.

01:31.612 --> 01:33.584
Brooke, this is not the
costume we agreed on.

01:33.653 --> 01:36.626
Well, then, I guess I'm
also a dirty, no-good liar.

01:36.695 --> 01:37.764
Good morning, Paul.

01:43.848 --> 01:45.617
No special effects, baby.

01:45.686 --> 01:47.054
If you like what you see,

01:47.122 --> 01:48.892
that's exactly what I'm working with.

01:48.960 --> 01:51.498
Um, barf.

01:56.714 --> 01:58.751
Hey, Tay, it's your mother.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.388
Again.

02:00.456 --> 02:03.529
Call me, honey.

02:03.596 --> 02:05.768
It smells suspiciously like

02:05.836 --> 02:08.107
birthday chicken-dumpling soup in here.

02:08.175 --> 02:12.284
Well, I was feeling particularly
energetic this morning,

02:12.351 --> 02:15.691
and it's the least I can do
for having missed your birthday.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.195
Well, you didn't miss my birthday, mom.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.498
I just didn't get your message

02:18.566 --> 02:19.801
because I was at that fundraiser.

02:19.869 --> 02:21.939
Same difference. We didn't
speak on your birthday.

02:22.040 --> 02:23.308
First time ever.

02:23.376 --> 02:25.311
Well, I would continue to argue with you,

02:25.379 --> 02:26.513
but I really want soup.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.818
So can I please stir the dumpling batter?

02:28.886 --> 02:30.889
Ah, you know you can, sweetie.

02:30.957 --> 02:33.795
It's always been a
two-person recipe, baby.

02:35.199 --> 02:37.502
Hey, mom.

02:37.570 --> 02:39.539
I love you.

02:40.776 --> 02:42.511
Oh... good... lord.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.382
You have been saying that every 10 minutes

02:44.449 --> 02:45.785
since you learned I have cancer.

02:45.853 --> 02:48.589
I'm not gonna keel over
in the soup pot, Haley.

02:48.657 --> 02:50.226
Okay. But in case I do...

02:51.964 --> 02:54.000
I love you, too.

02:58.041 --> 03:00.377
Now, let's not be morbid.

03:00.445 --> 03:03.550
Stir.

03:08.393 --> 03:10.763
Dressed to kill at 9:00 in the morning.

03:10.831 --> 03:12.867
Either you met a boy or...

03:12.935 --> 03:14.403
You met a boy.

03:14.470 --> 03:17.508
I met an agent. A very cute agent.

03:17.576 --> 03:19.411
With a very expensive car

03:19.513 --> 03:23.285
and a very naked ring finger.

03:23.352 --> 03:26.356
And did this miracle of
nature and bachelorhood

03:26.424 --> 03:27.558
sign you to his agency?

03:27.626 --> 03:29.395
I'm meeting with him this morning.

03:29.463 --> 03:32.066
He'll either sign me or marry me.

03:32.134 --> 03:34.136
Either way, this just
might be the first day

03:34.204 --> 03:38.143
of the rest of my life.

03:38.211 --> 03:39.412
So...

03:39.479 --> 03:40.981
shall we get to the elephant in the room?

03:41.049 --> 03:42.650
Sure.

03:42.718 --> 03:45.222
His name is Harold, and he's very sweet.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.125
He never forgets, but he's very forgiving.

03:47.192 --> 03:48.829
And on that note...

03:48.896 --> 03:50.932
I'm really sorry I asked you out.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.434
It's okay.

03:52.502 --> 03:54.838
No, it's not. I had too much to drink.

03:54.906 --> 03:57.443
And Haley was at tric giving
this kind of "carpe diem" speech

03:57.510 --> 03:59.546
that just makes you want
to stand on your desk

03:59.614 --> 04:01.851
and tear the pages out of your textbook.

04:01.919 --> 04:04.255
And I just...

04:04.322 --> 04:05.858
I got carried away.

04:05.925 --> 04:08.328
Well, I was flattered.

04:08.396 --> 04:09.797
Seriously.

04:09.866 --> 04:11.200
It's just...

04:11.268 --> 04:12.569
Skills.

04:12.636 --> 04:14.204
Actually, it's more Millicent.

04:14.272 --> 04:16.740
You were just jealous of
her hanging out with Owen.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.408
Look...

04:19.476 --> 04:22.643
I really like you.

04:22.711 --> 04:24.577
But I would rather be
your partner in crime

04:24.644 --> 04:26.244
than your rebound.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.247
Wheel man or bag man?

04:31.314 --> 04:33.881
Bag lady. No. Bag... woman?

04:33.948 --> 04:37.483
I'll just take the food.

04:39.819 --> 04:41.319
Hey.

04:41.387 --> 04:43.387
What are you looking at?

04:46.355 --> 04:48.087
It's your mom's funeral arrangements.

04:48.154 --> 04:49.455
She left them here on the desk.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.695
It's like contracts.

04:57.763 --> 05:00.364
This is how it ends, huh?

05:00.432 --> 05:01.765
With a line-item total.

05:01.832 --> 05:03.867
Hales, it's okay.

05:03.934 --> 05:07.204
I can... I can read through this stuff.

05:09.907 --> 05:12.474
How am I supposed to do this, Nathan?

05:12.542 --> 05:14.676
The same way you always do...

05:14.744 --> 05:18.313
Gracefully and courageously...

05:18.380 --> 05:22.349
And with me at your side
every step of the way.

05:22.417 --> 05:23.483
Okay?

05:23.551 --> 05:25.018
Okay.

05:34.260 --> 05:37.028
So, Mr. Agent...

05:37.096 --> 05:38.929
tell me this is just the beginning

05:38.997 --> 05:41.565
of a beautiful relationship.

05:46.103 --> 05:47.537
"Let's not be morbid"?

05:47.605 --> 05:50.039
You left your funeral
arrangements lying around, mom.

05:50.107 --> 05:51.207
Mom?

05:52.409 --> 05:54.943
Mom! Mom!

05:55.010 --> 05:57.078
Mom! Mom! No, no, mom. Hey! Hey!

05:57.145 --> 05:59.380
Nathan! Nathan!

05:59.447 --> 06:00.747
Nathan!

06:06.004 --> 06:10.769
It's just amazing how difference between good a
day and a bad day can come down to a good, long...

06:10.837 --> 06:11.869
Ouch!

06:11.937 --> 06:14.437
Oops. You were saying?

06:14.505 --> 06:16.906
I was saying a good, long sleep

06:16.973 --> 06:18.507
can totally give you
an attitude adjustment.

06:18.575 --> 06:19.674
You should try it.

06:19.742 --> 06:21.509
Like it was the sleep.

06:23.679 --> 06:26.847
Oh, you're grumpy because
we had sex, aren't you?

06:26.915 --> 06:29.349
Excuse me?

06:29.417 --> 06:30.717
I told him not to tell you.

06:30.784 --> 06:32.318
Besides, it just sort of happened,

06:32.386 --> 06:34.086
and then it just sort
of happened again and...

06:34.154 --> 06:35.187
Ouch! Son of a...

06:35.255 --> 06:37.288
It just sort of happened.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.990
Whatever.

06:39.058 --> 06:40.492
Ouch!

06:40.559 --> 06:42.060
And then it just sort of happened again.

06:46.331 --> 06:48.432
I know my stats could be better,

06:48.499 --> 06:49.633
but I'm training like crazy.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.100
And let's be honest...

06:51.168 --> 06:52.835
They're better than Anna
Kournikova's were at my age.

06:52.903 --> 06:55.438
And at the risk of
sounding a little conceited,

06:55.505 --> 06:59.174
I, like Anna, could make
a wheaties box look good.

07:01.010 --> 07:03.544
You're right... on all accounts.

07:03.612 --> 07:06.280
I have no doubt that you have a
very bright future ahead of you,

07:06.348 --> 07:10.217
you know, both professionally
and commercially.

07:10.284 --> 07:12.118
B... but I... I can't represent you.

07:13.619 --> 07:16.354
I don't get it. Then why am I here?

07:16.422 --> 07:19.057
Because I thought I could. But I can't.

07:19.124 --> 07:21.692
And I can't really explain it.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.760
I'm sorry.

07:25.363 --> 07:27.530
Well, if you can't sign me...

07:27.598 --> 07:30.866
The least you can do is take
me out on a consolation date.

07:30.934 --> 07:32.601
A date?

07:32.669 --> 07:34.402
Come on.

07:34.470 --> 07:37.171
I saw the way you were
looking at me last night.

07:37.239 --> 07:39.940
You were practically imagining our babies.

07:41.075 --> 07:42.409
Look, I'm... I'm sorry...

07:42.476 --> 07:44.543
Hey. It's okay.

07:45.912 --> 07:47.312
I think you're hot, too.

07:51.783 --> 07:53.617
Hi.

07:55.886 --> 07:57.620
When?

07:57.688 --> 07:59.055
I'm so sorry.

07:59.123 --> 08:00.122
I'm on my way.

08:01.658 --> 08:02.958
Yeah.

08:03.026 --> 08:05.126
Yeah.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.162
Call me when the fire's put out.

08:09.897 --> 08:13.165
I'm sorry, but that's
not gonna happen, Sara.

08:13.233 --> 08:13.999
"Sara"?

08:17.173 --> 08:18.275
Right.

08:18.343 --> 08:19.676
I mean Katie.

08:19.744 --> 08:20.810
Who's Sara?

08:20.878 --> 08:22.211
I got to go.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.758
"Hi, daughter." "Hi, mother."

08:37.826 --> 08:39.592
How was your morning
on the set, daughter?"

08:39.659 --> 08:41.827
Oh, it was just fine, mother.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.295
Fine until the ex love of my life

08:44.363 --> 08:46.597
and current bane of my existence

08:46.665 --> 08:47.831
made it very clear to me

08:47.899 --> 08:51.301
that they did the wild thing last night!"

08:53.774 --> 08:55.776
This is where the motherly sympathy

08:55.844 --> 08:57.578
is supposed to start kicking in!

08:57.646 --> 08:58.813
Sorry.

08:58.880 --> 09:02.650
I've been, um, wasting
all my self-pity on me.

09:02.718 --> 09:05.653
But if misery loves company,

09:05.721 --> 09:07.821
I did get stood up last night.

09:07.889 --> 09:10.089
Paul stood you up?

09:10.156 --> 09:11.587
What a toad!

09:11.655 --> 09:12.820
I never said it...

09:12.888 --> 09:14.488
You didn't have to.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.689
It is so clear to me that the Julian apple

09:16.756 --> 09:19.891
did not fall far from
the sleazy Paul tree!

09:31.168 --> 09:33.836
Did I ruin the soup?

09:33.904 --> 09:36.339
Well, that depends on
whether or not you think

09:36.407 --> 09:38.474
my floor is clean enough to eat off.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.408
And I was looking forward to that.

09:41.476 --> 09:43.441
And in my condition,

09:43.508 --> 09:47.441
one can only do so much looking forward.

09:47.509 --> 09:48.943
It's okay.

09:49.010 --> 09:51.912
You're gonna be around long
enough to make a lot more soup.

09:51.980 --> 09:54.681
Hey, girls. It's okay.

09:54.749 --> 09:55.982
The doctors talked to me, too.

09:56.049 --> 09:58.783
And I know that I...

09:58.851 --> 10:01.987
I don't have much time.

10:02.055 --> 10:04.957
But it's okay.

10:05.025 --> 10:09.896
I had wonderful visits
with each of my children.

10:11.768 --> 10:14.202
It's not fair.

10:14.270 --> 10:16.805
Doctors promised you a few more months.

10:16.872 --> 10:20.741
Cancer doesn't care
much for promises, baby.

10:20.809 --> 10:23.777
I mean, after all, I promised myself

10:23.845 --> 10:25.011
that I would stick around

10:25.079 --> 10:27.246
until you two were
right with Taylor again.

10:27.314 --> 10:30.916
Well, great. You'll be here forever.

10:33.086 --> 10:34.686
God.

10:34.754 --> 10:38.623
You all were probably too
young to remember, but...

10:41.126 --> 10:43.994
you three girls were...

10:44.062 --> 10:46.029
You were inseparable at one point.

10:46.096 --> 10:47.397
I mean, look.

10:50.801 --> 10:52.801
That's a long time ago.

10:55.138 --> 10:57.506
Yeah. She seems almost human here.

10:59.342 --> 11:00.775
Two out of three.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.580
Ain't bad.

11:09.051 --> 11:10.584
Come here.

11:10.652 --> 11:11.819
My sweet things.

11:26.832 --> 11:28.933
You should really call first.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.867
Mom's dying.

11:30.935 --> 11:32.369
Yeah, eventually.

11:32.437 --> 11:34.371
No. Now.

11:34.438 --> 11:39.042
She collapsed this morning,
and they don't think that...

11:39.110 --> 11:41.177
This it it, Taylor.

11:41.245 --> 11:43.179
This is the time to say goodbye.

11:43.247 --> 11:45.980
I don't think so.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.682
Please stop.

11:48.749 --> 11:51.585
Look, I don't know what your problem is.

11:51.653 --> 11:54.788
And I... I don't understand you at all.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.756
I don't know when or why

11:56.824 --> 12:00.093
you became such a colossal, selfish bitch.

12:00.160 --> 12:03.162
But I know that you're my sister.

12:03.230 --> 12:05.564
And I love you.

12:05.632 --> 12:07.399
And I know that mom wants to see you.

12:07.467 --> 12:10.468
And I know that it's
the right thing to do.

12:12.304 --> 12:16.140
Well, you also know that I
rarely do the right thing.

12:16.207 --> 12:18.175
Taylor, please.

12:20.711 --> 12:22.778
Fine. I tried.

12:22.846 --> 12:26.048
Way to go, perfect daughter!

12:30.018 --> 12:32.186
What the hell is this?

12:32.254 --> 12:34.021
That's the real you.

12:34.089 --> 12:36.290
The sister you used to be.

12:36.357 --> 12:37.390
I...

12:37.458 --> 12:40.293
I don't want this, Quinn!

12:42.496 --> 12:44.864
I don't want this.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.148
Well, that must have been
some dream you were having.

13:06.216 --> 13:08.216
You were awfully smiley.

13:08.284 --> 13:12.052
I was dreaming about your dad.

13:12.120 --> 13:15.889
I woke up smelling his cologne.

13:15.956 --> 13:17.423
What kind did he wear?

13:17.491 --> 13:20.793
Stetson.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.494
Back when I first met him,

13:22.562 --> 13:26.198
he was something of a dime-store cowboy.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.467
A cowboy? Dad?

13:28.534 --> 13:30.735
We can't be talking about the same father.

13:30.803 --> 13:34.838
You'd be surprised what you
don't know about that man.

13:34.906 --> 13:37.407
Or about both of us, actually.

13:39.177 --> 13:40.510
Like what?

13:40.578 --> 13:42.078
Oh, I don't know.

13:42.146 --> 13:45.014
Well, come on, like...

13:45.082 --> 13:47.951
Did you guys have a song or...

13:48.018 --> 13:51.721
"Don't think twice, it's
all right" by Bob Dylan.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.490
That's a breakup song.

13:54.558 --> 13:58.594
I know, but it's what was
playing in that old Chevy pickup

13:58.962 --> 14:01.497
- the first time that we...
- Uh, uh, "kissed," please.

14:01.564 --> 14:02.598
"Kissed."

14:02.665 --> 14:04.399
Oh, now, that...

14:04.467 --> 14:07.501
that was at a Christmas mixer.

14:07.569 --> 14:08.935
Mistletoe...

14:09.003 --> 14:11.437
Nat King Cole on the record player.

14:11.505 --> 14:13.607
Huh.

14:13.674 --> 14:17.745
I felt that kiss in my toes.

14:17.813 --> 14:20.548
And you won his heart with
your chicken-dumpling soup, huh?

14:20.616 --> 14:22.350
I won his heart...

14:22.417 --> 14:28.088
With a note that I left
in his jean-jacket pocket.

14:28.155 --> 14:31.624
I won his stomach with
my chicken-dumpling soup.

14:35.928 --> 14:39.662
I don't even have the recipe.

14:39.730 --> 14:42.431
Well, give me a pen.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.234
Come on.

14:49.470 --> 14:50.837
Here.

14:50.904 --> 14:52.639
Now...

14:52.707 --> 14:57.175
The secret, as you know...

14:57.243 --> 15:00.208
Is to stir the batter slowly.

15:00.276 --> 15:03.640
And whole peppercorns.

15:03.708 --> 15:06.676
None of that table stuff.

15:06.743 --> 15:10.512
And always start with
a whole chicken, okay?

15:15.484 --> 15:16.917
Hey, jame!

15:18.153 --> 15:20.287
We need to talk, buddy.

15:20.355 --> 15:22.689
Man to man?

15:22.757 --> 15:25.525
Yeah.

15:25.593 --> 15:27.460
When you were at andre's this morning,

15:27.528 --> 15:29.395
your grandma got sicker.

15:29.463 --> 15:30.863
She's in the hospital now.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.765
And, um, she'd like to see you.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.135
She's gonna die now, isn't she?

15:42.373 --> 15:43.773
Man to man?

15:45.642 --> 15:48.077
Yeah, buddy.

15:48.144 --> 15:49.878
Pretty soon.

15:52.581 --> 15:54.849
You want to talk about it?

15:54.917 --> 15:58.252
If it wasn't for grandma,
I wouldn't have Chester.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.755
Didn't your mom and I buy you Chester?

16:01.822 --> 16:03.923
Yeah, but you didn't really have a choice.

16:03.991 --> 16:05.791
Grandma taught me to wish on a star.

16:05.859 --> 16:08.860
And you wished for Chester?

16:08.928 --> 16:10.195
Wouldn't you?

16:10.263 --> 16:12.096
Yeah.

16:14.699 --> 16:17.201
Can I have a few minutes before we leave?

16:17.268 --> 16:19.269
Sure.

16:19.336 --> 16:21.804
I'll be downstairs with
your mom, all right?

16:27.343 --> 16:31.045
All right, let's go,
people! Rehearsal's up!

16:31.113 --> 16:32.814
It was crazy-hot.

16:32.881 --> 16:35.015
When he finally caught
his breath enough to speak,

16:35.083 --> 16:37.617
he actually called it
a religious experience.

16:39.253 --> 16:40.853
I know.

16:46.591 --> 16:47.925
But the last girl he was with

16:47.992 --> 16:50.127
practically qualifies
for a senior discount.

16:50.195 --> 16:51.995
I know.

16:53.364 --> 16:54.864
Julian?

16:56.300 --> 16:58.334
Have you called last looks
for hair and makeup yet?

16:58.401 --> 16:59.601
No. Why?

16:59.669 --> 17:01.369
Just trying to be professional.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.492
Alex, you okay?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.925
I'm fine.

17:09.993 --> 17:12.361
Ouch.

17:12.428 --> 17:14.429
Wow. Ouch.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.598
Get off my set.

17:17.665 --> 17:20.067
Do you have any idea the kinds of
things she has been saying about...

17:20.135 --> 17:22.336
I don't care, Brooke! Get off my set!

17:22.404 --> 17:24.271
- Julian!
- I don't care!

17:24.339 --> 17:28.708
Yeah, I guess you've
made that pretty obvious.

17:28.776 --> 17:30.043
Excuse me.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.350
It smells awesome.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.688
It's my mom's recipe.

17:44.756 --> 17:46.322
You okay?

17:46.390 --> 17:48.491
Yeah, I was just...

17:48.559 --> 17:50.126
Where's Jamie?

17:50.193 --> 17:52.327
He'll be downstairs in a second.

17:52.395 --> 17:53.528
Haley.

17:55.564 --> 17:57.765
He knows.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.900
I thought we decided we
weren't gonna tell him.

17:59.968 --> 18:01.835
He guessed.

18:04.905 --> 18:07.306
Of course he did. He's
so familiar with death.

18:07.374 --> 18:08.841
- Why wouldn't he?
- Haley.

18:08.909 --> 18:10.175
Ow! Damn it!

18:10.243 --> 18:11.877
- Are you
okay? - Mm-hmm.

18:11.944 --> 18:13.978
Are you okay? Is it bad?

18:14.046 --> 18:15.379
Yeah, it's bad. It's really bad.

18:15.447 --> 18:16.880
My mom's dying, and I'm making soup!

18:16.948 --> 18:18.615
Because there's nothing else that I can do

18:18.682 --> 18:21.283
because I can't stop it
because nothing can stop it!

18:21.351 --> 18:25.153
Okay. All right.

18:25.221 --> 18:28.189
There's just... this is so...

18:28.257 --> 18:30.591
There's so many moments
and there's so much

18:30.659 --> 18:34.361
that go with her when she dies.

18:34.429 --> 18:36.163
I don't know what the
right questions are to ask.

18:36.231 --> 18:38.332
And I don't... I'm not ready for this.

18:38.399 --> 18:40.734
I'm just really not ready.

18:42.670 --> 18:45.507
Nobody ever is.

18:47.743 --> 18:49.244
Whoa. You all right?

18:49.312 --> 18:52.647
In movies, you never see how
much punching hurts the puncher.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.115
And who did the puncher punch?

18:54.182 --> 18:56.282
- Alex.
- Because?

18:56.350 --> 18:59.085
Because I went to Julian's
hotel room last night,

18:59.153 --> 19:01.020
and I saw Alex naked in his bed,

19:01.088 --> 19:03.022
and I could hear him in the shower.

19:03.090 --> 19:04.957
Oh, dear.

19:05.025 --> 19:06.791
- Yeah. You said it.
- No, I meant...

19:06.859 --> 19:08.725
"Oh, dear, I don't know
whose room she was in,

19:08.793 --> 19:14.058
but Alex was with me last night.

19:14.126 --> 19:16.260
And she was very naked."

19:16.328 --> 19:17.728
You?

19:17.796 --> 19:18.762
Yes.

19:18.830 --> 19:20.162
Not Julian?

19:20.230 --> 19:21.697
No.

19:21.764 --> 19:23.397
In Julian's hotel room?

19:23.465 --> 19:24.598
Apparently.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.532
Oh, my God!

19:28.135 --> 19:29.402
Hey, come on!

19:29.469 --> 19:32.304
Look, whatever you've done...

19:32.372 --> 19:34.440
How... how bad can it be?

19:34.508 --> 19:36.509
We're completely screwed.

19:36.576 --> 19:39.211
We can't shoot a thing
until the swelling goes down.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.079
Okay.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.647
"Okay"?

19:42.714 --> 19:45.049
This is a
$50,000-a-day operation.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.584
Let's do the math
before we call it "okay."

19:47.652 --> 19:49.719
I am so sorry.

19:49.787 --> 19:51.087
This is not your fault. We'll just...

19:51.154 --> 19:52.755
Roll with the punches?

19:54.658 --> 19:58.761
Right now your job is to
keep ice on that eye, okay?

20:04.133 --> 20:07.668
Uh, looks like we're gonna
get a couple days off.

20:07.736 --> 20:09.870
You know what's good on a black eye?

20:09.938 --> 20:12.172
If you say, "raw meat,"

20:12.240 --> 20:14.975
I will tear out your tonsils,
tie off your weiner bag,

20:15.042 --> 20:17.443
and castrate you like a bull.

20:17.511 --> 20:21.380
Well, you mess with the bull...

20:21.448 --> 20:24.383
You know what you get.

20:26.052 --> 20:28.886
That doesn't even make sense!

20:47.504 --> 20:49.405
Well, well.

20:52.775 --> 20:55.977
I could smell it coming
all the way down the hall.

20:57.612 --> 20:59.780
Ah, here's the real test.

21:04.618 --> 21:06.119
How's it taste? Is it too salty?

21:06.187 --> 21:08.021
Are the dumplings soggy?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.794
It's perfect.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.329
It's not perfect.

21:14.397 --> 21:16.865
I made it myself, and
it's a two-person recipe.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.067
Oh, sweetie.

21:20.869 --> 21:24.100
I followed your recipe to the letter.

21:24.168 --> 21:25.367
And when it was finished,

21:25.435 --> 21:27.100
I realized that it's not the soup I love.

21:27.167 --> 21:29.765
It's making it with my mom.

21:29.833 --> 21:30.998
Okay.

21:31.065 --> 21:33.466
And now she's leaving me.

21:33.534 --> 21:37.036
I may have some unconventional
beliefs about the afterlife,

21:37.103 --> 21:38.704
but I can tell you right now

21:38.772 --> 21:41.740
I have no intention of leaving you.

21:41.807 --> 21:45.142
You just prepare to be
haunted, Haley James Scott.

21:48.046 --> 21:49.379
Hi, grandma!

21:50.715 --> 21:52.849
Oh, goodness gracious!

21:52.916 --> 21:55.384
When did they start letting
squirrels into the hospital?

21:55.452 --> 21:57.386
Get on up here, boy.

21:57.454 --> 21:59.021
Give your old grandmother a kiss.

22:02.591 --> 22:04.091
What you got there, huh?

22:04.159 --> 22:06.460
"The handsomest husky."

22:06.528 --> 22:09.096
Mom reads to me whenever I'm sick.

22:09.163 --> 22:10.697
It pretty much makes me feel better.

22:10.765 --> 22:11.965
You want to hear it?

22:12.033 --> 22:15.702
I can't think of anything

22:15.770 --> 22:17.437
that I would like more.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.105
"Once upon a time, there
was a dog named Andy.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.141
Everybody loved Andy.
He was very handsome.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.877
Andy had a best friend. His name was Mike.

22:25.944 --> 22:29.846
Andy and Mike did everything together."

22:51.242 --> 22:52.943
Why is the store closed?

22:53.011 --> 22:55.879
And why are you lying on the floor?

22:55.946 --> 22:58.547
I'm trying to pick a place to hang myself.

22:58.615 --> 23:00.549
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

23:00.616 --> 23:04.418
Apparently it's best to
find a load-bearing beam.

23:04.485 --> 23:06.119
I don't think we have one.

23:09.822 --> 23:12.957
Fine.

23:13.024 --> 23:15.059
You want to talk about it?

23:15.126 --> 23:17.394
What is there to discuss?

23:17.461 --> 23:22.063
I'm the donkey in a big,
stupid shakespearean mixup.

23:22.131 --> 23:24.665
You're not making any sense.

23:24.733 --> 23:29.035
Alex slept with Alexander, not Julian.

23:30.638 --> 23:33.808
So, I ruined wardrobe...

23:33.876 --> 23:36.945
bitched out the one man
who makes my world turn...

23:37.013 --> 23:38.813
And clocked an interloping hoochie

23:38.880 --> 23:43.015
whose only mistake was
boning crocodile dundee.

23:43.083 --> 23:46.117
You realize you're overlooking
the best part of this...

23:46.185 --> 23:48.218
Julian didn't sleep with Alex.

23:50.788 --> 23:53.055
And as far as that Shakespearean play,

23:53.123 --> 23:56.824
as I recall, the donkey gets
turned back into a person

23:56.892 --> 23:58.792
once he realizes what an ass he's been.

24:00.228 --> 24:02.362
You think I should go talk to Julian?

24:02.429 --> 24:05.297
It's far less tacky than suicide.

24:08.066 --> 24:09.400
Thanks, mom.

24:13.937 --> 24:15.471
Hi, mom.

24:15.538 --> 24:17.238
Hey.

24:17.306 --> 24:18.507
Hey.

24:18.575 --> 24:19.909
How you feeling?

24:19.977 --> 24:22.212
Ooh, a little tired.

24:22.279 --> 24:24.081
What's with all the hardware?

24:24.149 --> 24:25.416
Your daughter and I

24:25.483 --> 24:27.685
have been working on
something special for you.

24:27.753 --> 24:29.553
I'll be right back.

24:29.621 --> 24:32.690
Okay.

24:36.962 --> 24:41.828
Now, you know that I loved David, but...

24:41.895 --> 24:44.729
I have the same feeling about Clay

24:44.797 --> 24:46.697
that I did with Nathan.

24:46.765 --> 24:49.133
I think he's one of the good ones.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.335
Yeah.

24:51.403 --> 24:54.338
He's special.

24:54.406 --> 24:56.206
I really love him.

24:56.274 --> 24:57.907
Well, have you told him?

24:57.975 --> 25:00.342
Not yet.

25:00.410 --> 25:02.512
But I think he's pretty clear on that.

25:02.579 --> 25:05.814
Oh, you do, do you?

25:05.882 --> 25:09.417
Well, just in case you
haven't figured this out yet,

25:09.485 --> 25:13.587
men need to be hit over
the head with things.

25:13.655 --> 25:15.590
Sometimes frying pans.

25:15.657 --> 25:18.159
But mostly love.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.360
Don't be afraid to do it.

25:20.428 --> 25:22.162
Am I that obvious?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.830
You have always been my heart girl,

25:24.898 --> 25:28.466
the one with the most unbridled passions.

25:28.533 --> 25:32.235
Just give your head permission

25:32.302 --> 25:34.570
to follow your heart, okay?

25:34.637 --> 25:37.739
Okay. I promise.

25:48.148 --> 25:50.182
Hi.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.834
Oh, my God!

26:05.901 --> 26:07.370
Didn't know your own
strength, did you, bamm-bamm?

26:07.438 --> 26:10.039
Uh... I was...

26:10.107 --> 26:13.008
You're looking for Julian. Come in.

26:13.075 --> 26:15.010
He switched rooms with me
last night because the guys

26:15.078 --> 26:17.479
in the room next to me were
keeping me up with their...

26:17.547 --> 26:19.614
Whatever they were doing.

26:19.682 --> 26:22.950
Which explains why he was exhausted today.

26:24.986 --> 26:26.253
Can I ask why you punched me?

26:26.321 --> 26:27.554
Because I know we weren't gonna,

26:27.622 --> 26:29.289
like, braid each other's
hair anytime soon,

26:29.357 --> 26:31.424
but I kind of thought we were okay.

26:31.492 --> 26:33.759
We were.

26:33.827 --> 26:36.295
We are. I...

26:36.363 --> 26:39.298
I came here last night, late.

26:39.366 --> 26:40.867
You were sleeping,

26:40.935 --> 26:44.403
and I guess it was
Alexander in the shower?

26:44.471 --> 26:46.171
But you thought it was Julian.

26:48.207 --> 26:49.874
I wish.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.410
Seriously, I'm not
gonna lie to you, Brooke,

26:52.478 --> 26:54.945
but it's never gonna happen between us.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.480
You know why?

26:56.547 --> 26:58.014
Because whether you guys

26:58.082 --> 27:00.783
continue to push each other away or not,

27:00.851 --> 27:04.119
he knows what it's like
to really be in love.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.288
I never had a chance.

27:10.292 --> 27:12.460
Alex, I'm sorry.

27:12.527 --> 27:14.495
For everything.

27:15.897 --> 27:17.764
Me too.

27:17.832 --> 27:20.032
For everything.

27:42.318 --> 27:46.288
I'm so glad you came.

27:46.355 --> 27:49.523
You know it's all right to
be upset about all of this.

27:49.591 --> 27:51.292
I mean...

27:51.359 --> 27:53.727
Lord knows I am.

27:53.795 --> 27:58.297
It's pretty upsetting stuff.

28:05.237 --> 28:07.004
I came to tell you

28:07.072 --> 28:10.307
that I'm sorry for being
such a disappointment.

28:10.375 --> 28:13.410
Is that what you think?

28:13.477 --> 28:16.179
That I'm disappointed with you?

28:16.246 --> 28:18.781
Why wouldn't you be?

28:18.849 --> 28:21.349
I'm awful.

28:21.417 --> 28:25.585
All of my siblings are talented or smart

28:25.653 --> 28:27.620
or both.

28:27.688 --> 28:29.822
And I'm just Taylor.

28:29.890 --> 28:33.657
Nobody likes Taylor.

28:33.725 --> 28:35.392
I do.

28:35.460 --> 28:38.395
You have to say that. You're my mother.

28:38.463 --> 28:40.933
Get over here.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.903
Come here.

28:46.539 --> 28:48.039
Here is something...

28:48.107 --> 28:51.409
That nobody else knows.

28:51.477 --> 28:53.711
Of all of my kids,

28:53.778 --> 28:57.947
you are the one who reminds
me the most of myself.

28:58.015 --> 28:59.816
I don't believe it.

28:59.883 --> 29:03.752
Well, that's because you've
only known Lydia the mom.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.488
But there was a very...

29:06.555 --> 29:09.190
Taylor-ish Lydia before that.

29:09.258 --> 29:13.460
And that's why I have never had any doubt

29:13.528 --> 29:17.163
that you will find
your way, because I did.

29:17.231 --> 29:19.332
And you can fight this all you want,

29:19.400 --> 29:22.568
but you are going to end up happy.

29:22.635 --> 29:26.471
I've been so awful.

29:26.539 --> 29:28.072
How can you still love me?

29:28.140 --> 29:32.243
Oh, God! My sweet baby.

29:32.311 --> 29:36.079
My love for you has
never been in question.

29:36.147 --> 29:37.914
The only question here is,

29:37.982 --> 29:43.085
how long is it going to take
for you to love yourself?

29:44.320 --> 29:46.788
Because wherever I am,

29:46.856 --> 29:49.457
wherever I go from here...

29:49.525 --> 29:52.660
I will never, ever

29:52.728 --> 29:54.662
let go of you.

29:54.729 --> 29:56.230
Please don't leave.

30:04.003 --> 30:05.237
It's okay.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.138
It's okay.

30:24.821 --> 30:27.055
- Victoria, I just want to say...
- Don't bother.

30:27.123 --> 30:28.389
I know why you stood me up.

30:28.457 --> 30:30.091
You were with that snotty little actress.

30:30.158 --> 30:32.026
It was just sex. It...

30:32.985 --> 30:34.770
Victoria, you and I are different, okay?

30:36.417 --> 30:39.298
Finished! Good night, Alexander.

30:59.717 --> 31:01.817
I have a surprise for you.

31:03.253 --> 31:05.354
I love surprises.

31:05.421 --> 31:06.755
What is it?

31:15.964 --> 31:17.664
Make a wish.

31:26.039 --> 31:28.206
What's going on?

31:32.077 --> 31:34.478
An audience.

31:48.456 --> 31:50.990
Listen.

31:51.058 --> 31:53.759
I'm really sorry.

31:53.827 --> 31:57.362
I know that I have been a lousy sister.

31:57.430 --> 31:59.998
And I totally don't deserve it...

32:02.167 --> 32:05.269
but if you could maybe
give me another chance.

32:05.336 --> 32:08.171
Okay?

32:08.239 --> 32:11.374
From now on, I'll be better.

32:19.314 --> 32:21.548
It's okay.

32:40.383 --> 32:42.317
I know I'm banned from the set,

32:42.385 --> 32:44.619
but I need to clear something up.

32:44.687 --> 32:46.554
Well, this better be good.

32:46.621 --> 32:49.488
That black eye's gonna
cost us about 100 grand.

32:49.556 --> 32:51.956
If it helps, it cost me my dignity.

32:52.024 --> 32:54.358
Brooke, what the hell happened today?

32:54.426 --> 32:57.260
I thought you slept with Alex.

32:57.328 --> 33:00.664
So, basically, you still don't trust me.

33:00.731 --> 33:03.166
No. Basically I got jealous.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.034
Because I'm in love with you, Julian,

33:05.101 --> 33:07.202
and I always will be.

33:07.270 --> 33:10.071
And that's gonna make me
do stupid things sometimes

33:10.139 --> 33:11.606
because love is crazy.

33:11.673 --> 33:15.609
And I've been crazy. I know.

33:15.677 --> 33:17.711
First, I thought you
were falling for Alex,

33:17.778 --> 33:20.247
and then, last night,
I went to your hotel,

33:20.315 --> 33:22.048
and I thought you fell for Alex.

33:22.116 --> 33:23.951
I'm sorry.

33:31.858 --> 33:34.159
You think too much, Brooke Davis.

33:47.706 --> 33:49.874
Are you comfortable?

33:49.942 --> 33:51.275
Yes.

33:51.343 --> 33:53.411
Okay, mom. Here we go.

34:00.051 --> 34:03.086
Oh, my goodness.

34:06.723 --> 34:10.155
My beautiful babies.

34:53.621 --> 34:54.556
How long have you been out here?

34:58.460 --> 35:00.227
I like you.

35:00.294 --> 35:02.895
- Okay?
- I know I slept with Alex.

35:02.963 --> 35:05.297
But I like you.

35:05.365 --> 35:06.431
A lot.

35:09.835 --> 35:11.602
I like...

35:29.784 --> 35:31.351
Nice job othe eye.

35:31.419 --> 35:32.553
Not good enough for film,

35:32.620 --> 35:33.987
but definitely good enough for sex.

35:35.422 --> 35:40.225
If you talk, I can't
pretend you're somebody else.

36:17.356 --> 36:20.591
I guess I did all right, didn't I?

36:25.063 --> 36:28.098
You did everything, mom.

36:29.567 --> 36:32.501
Hello, handsome.

38:46.715 --> 38:49.083
Come in.

38:49.151 --> 38:51.285
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.222 --> 38:58.390
Okay, look, I wasn't worried
about being your rebound, Mouth.

38:58.458 --> 39:01.026
I was worried you'd be mine.

39:01.093 --> 39:02.894
What are you saying?

39:02.962 --> 39:05.597
I'm saying...

39:05.664 --> 39:07.298
What the hell.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.274
Anybody home?

39:19.342 --> 39:22.010
Hey, baby.

39:53.037 --> 39:54.404
Something smells awesome.

39:54.472 --> 39:55.672
Mm.

39:55.739 --> 39:58.708
This is your grandma's
chicken-dumpling soup.

39:58.775 --> 40:00.409
And you are just in time.

40:00.477 --> 40:02.244
- I am?
- Yes.

40:02.311 --> 40:03.745
Did you know that this is

40:03.813 --> 40:06.047
a very special
chicken-dumpling soup recipe

40:06.115 --> 40:07.415
that specifically calls

40:07.482 --> 40:09.883
for a handsome
7-year-old boy named Jamie

40:09.951 --> 40:12.052
to stir the dumpling batter?

40:12.120 --> 40:13.353
What are the chances?

40:13.421 --> 40:14.754
I don't know.

40:24.963 --> 40:29.066
Now, the secret is to
stir the batter slowly.

40:29.134 --> 40:33.036
And the whole peppercorns,
not the table stuff.

40:34.405 --> 40:36.606
Hey. What's up?

40:40.343 --> 40:42.678
What's up is that I love you.

40:42.745 --> 40:45.246
In case you didn't know.

40:51.819 --> 40:53.887
I love you, too.

40:53.955 --> 40:55.822
Nothing's ever gonna change that.

41:00.827 --> 41:04.462
Did I tell you? I'm gonna get that agent.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.330
He decided to sign you?

41:06.398 --> 41:08.032
Not yet, but he will.

41:08.100 --> 41:11.401
'Cause it turns out...

41:13.705 --> 41:18.708
I'm his type.
