00:59.945 --> 01:02.647
Male: What's up ladies?

01:28.707 --> 01:30.008
What's up ladies?

01:47.726 --> 01:50.361
I got beers!

01:50.563 --> 01:51.763
Here you go.
One for the lady.

01:51.964 --> 01:52.730
Thank you.

01:52.932 --> 01:54.098
One of the gentleman.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.567
I got an idea.

01:55.768 --> 01:56.868
How about some day
time skinny dipping?

01:57.069 --> 01:57.902
No way.

01:58.103 --> 01:59.971
Aww, come on babe.

02:00.172 --> 02:01.773
I'm gonna swim to that
buoy and back.

02:01.974 --> 02:04.342
And I make it, you gotta go
skinny dipping with me.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.127
A little further.

03:05.804 --> 03:08.406
Ha, Ha! yeah!

03:09.341 --> 03:10.408
Told you he's make it.

03:10.609 --> 03:12.310
Unbelievable.

03:12.511 --> 03:15.413
Well, do you want to strip down
now or wait till he gets back?

03:35.968 --> 03:36.968
Male #1: Whoo-hoo!

03:37.169 --> 03:39.137
Male #1: All of it.

03:41.674 --> 03:43.574
- Yeah.
- Now the bottom.

03:43.776 --> 03:45.843
I don't think so.

03:51.517 --> 03:53.918
Polly!

03:54.119 --> 03:56.688
Male #1: Polly! Polly!
Male #2: Mark! Get back onto the sand! There's a shark in the water!

04:08.534 --> 04:10.802
Hey, what the hell is that?

04:21.980 --> 04:22.680
Male #1: Get her out of the
water!

04:22.881 --> 04:24.082
Male #1: Get out!

04:24.283 --> 04:26.150
Mark: She was just here and now
she's gone.

04:32.091 --> 04:33.191
Get out of the water.

04:33.392 --> 04:35.259
Hey-

04:35.461 --> 04:37.395
Male #1: MARK!

04:40.599 --> 04:43.000
Male #1: Somebody.

04:43.202 --> 04:46.904
Female: Mark! Polly!
Male #1: Oh my god.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.307
What is it?

04:49.508 --> 04:51.309
Do you hear screaming?

04:51.510 --> 04:53.378
Screaming? No.

04:53.579 --> 04:55.613
I'll go check it out though.

06:36.014 --> 06:39.851
<i>Calling Dr.</i>
<i>Thomas. Maggie, the new</i>
<i>intern has arrived at the</i>

06:40.052 --> 06:46.457
<i>island research facility. I will</i>
<i>go up to meet her and will drop</i>
<i>by your office in 30 minutes.</i>

06:48.560 --> 06:51.028
<i>Actually</i>
<i>lets make that 15 minutes.</i>

06:51.230 --> 06:53.531
<i>We're heading</i>
<i>up there now.</i>

07:25.931 --> 07:28.065
Hello, you must be our new
intern.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.233
Maggie Peterson, I presume?

07:29.434 --> 07:30.535
And you must be
Dr. Nelson.

07:30.736 --> 07:32.036
Please call me "Ted".

07:32.237 --> 07:34.038
Come inside.
Okay.

07:34.239 --> 07:35.873
Watch your step.

07:48.153 --> 07:52.423
Oh, that's Dr. Leonard. He
doesn't do well around people.

07:52.624 --> 07:54.358
Especially if they're new.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.427
But at any rate, welcome to
Persephone.

07:56.628 --> 08:00.097
I'm thrilled to be here. Where
can I start first?

08:00.299 --> 08:04.368
Testing Ph levels, or helping
with today's specimen
acquisition?

08:04.570 --> 08:07.204
Raring, to go, huh? I knew we
hired you for a reason.

08:07.406 --> 08:10.942
But you've gotta crawl before
you walk, so, let's start you
with orientation.

08:11.143 --> 08:13.077
Oh. Great.

08:13.278 --> 08:15.012
It's not like pulling
teeth, I promise.

08:15.213 --> 08:17.448
So you really signed up to work
in this godforsaken bunker, huh?

08:17.649 --> 08:22.219
An opportunity to study the
Great Pacific Garbage patch up
close and personal?

08:22.421 --> 08:26.891
I'd never pass that up. Besides,
you get to do all the cool stuff
here at Persephone.

08:27.092 --> 08:31.862
Deep-sea dives. Animal
discovery. Save the ocean.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.198
Well most of the time,
it's just paperwork.

08:34.399 --> 08:37.034
Maggie: Oh.
Dr. Nelson: But don't worry.
We'll find you something
exciting to do.

08:37.235 --> 08:39.437
Come on. Let's store your gear
and I'll give you the full tour.

08:39.638 --> 08:43.341
Perfect. Absolutely perfect.

08:46.011 --> 08:48.779
Professor Thomas? I've got
someone here that you may like
to meet.

08:48.981 --> 08:50.948
Prof. Thomas: Oh! You must be
Maggie.
Maggie: Professor.

08:51.149 --> 08:52.483
It's such an honor to meet you.

08:52.684 --> 08:55.753
Please. All I do is study
garbage.

08:55.954 --> 08:57.989
Oh, we're about to go on the big
tour. Would you like to join us?

08:58.190 --> 08:59.690
Yeah! I'd love to.

08:59.891 --> 09:01.792
You know what, we have some
visitors coming today.

09:01.994 --> 09:04.428
Calling Dr. Thomas. The Earth
Pact has just docked...

09:04.630 --> 09:07.365
Dr. Thomas: Actually, they've
just arrived. So, why don't we
all do the tour together.

09:07.566 --> 09:09.700
You 2 can come with me.

09:09.901 --> 09:14.071
Male: Hey Brad, wait up top with
the bags while we go down into
the facility.

09:20.178 --> 09:23.314
Earth Pacters!
Hello!
Welcome!

09:23.515 --> 09:26.183
We're so glad you could
make it. It's always
nice when we can

09:26.385 --> 09:28.319
work with new,
potential colleagues.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.087
I'm professor Laura Thomas.

09:30.288 --> 09:31.522
And this is Dr. Ted Nelson,

09:31.723 --> 09:33.357
and we have our
newest inter-

09:33.558 --> 09:34.825
Greg?!

09:35.027 --> 09:38.195
You've gotta be kidding me?

09:40.699 --> 09:43.934
Care to introduce us to your
friend, Maggie?

09:45.103 --> 09:49.540
Uh... Sure. This is Greg.
He's a, um...

09:49.741 --> 09:50.908
We us to date
in college.

09:51.109 --> 09:52.643
Before I
dropped out,
that is.

09:52.844 --> 09:56.013
Naturally.

09:56.214 --> 09:58.983
I haven't seen you in what?
3 years?

09:59.184 --> 10:02.153
Yeah. Something like that.

10:04.523 --> 10:06.590
You look great.

10:06.792 --> 10:10.261
Prof. Thomas: Now that
we're all acquainted, why don't
you follow me.

10:18.970 --> 10:22.273
<i>Professor Thomas: So guys,</i>
<i>currently we're half a mile</i>
<i>under the ocean.</i>

10:22.474 --> 10:26.410
<i>This underwater station is so</i>
<i>special to everyone that works</i>
<i>here.</i>

10:26.611 --> 10:32.450
<i>With 45 qualified research</i>
<i>staff. Selected by the worlds</i>
<i>leading marine biology</i>

10:32.651 --> 10:35.319
<i>university programs and special</i>
<i>interest groups.</i>

10:35.520 --> 10:40.324
<i>We have 2 state of the art</i>
<i>underwater docks, and 3</i>
<i>submarine vehicles</i>

10:40.525 --> 10:43.227
<i>capable of collecting samples</i>
<i>from the ocean floor.</i>

10:43.428 --> 10:47.832
<i>And Procuring specimens of</i>
<i>local marine wildlife.</i>

10:49.334 --> 10:54.672
I'd like to formally welcome you
to the Persephone. It's truly
one of a kind research station.

10:54.873 --> 10:58.342
We built this station on an
island right next to the Garbage
patch,

10:58.543 --> 11:01.445
and it features a central crater
right down into the ocean.

11:01.646 --> 11:03.547
There are a group of smaller
islands scattered around the

11:03.749 --> 11:06.917
facility, used for above
water operations.

11:07.119 --> 11:12.289
It's the only research station
that allows us to fully study
oceanic, plant and avian life

11:12.491 --> 11:15.993
that could be impacted by the
nearby pollution, as well as
flora.

11:16.194 --> 11:20.164
We are so pleased that Earth
Pact has agreed to send you all
out here for the day,

11:20.365 --> 11:22.767
so you can collect all the
information that you need.

11:22.968 --> 11:25.402
Yes. It's something that we've
been pushing for a while.

11:25.604 --> 11:30.040
To get activist groups, like
yourselves, involved and get
that facts that you need.

11:30.242 --> 11:33.344
Yep! We believe that science and
activism can go hand in hand,

11:33.545 --> 11:36.380
and be a powerful force for
change.

11:37.215 --> 11:40.885
Well, why don't we get right
down to the tour, shall we?

11:41.086 --> 11:44.188
Dr. Nelson I'm going to let you
handle that. I'm gonna head to
the control room.

11:44.389 --> 11:45.990
Have fun.

11:48.460 --> 11:49.960
Okay Maggie, why don't we take
Greg and your friends and we
start at the top floor?

11:50.162 --> 11:52.296
And that why we get your
tour done as well.

11:52.497 --> 11:54.031
Sounds great.

11:54.699 --> 11:56.467
So, uh, we're with you?

11:56.668 --> 11:57.902
Looks that way.

11:58.103 --> 11:59.970
Guys, this is my old friend,
Maggie.

12:00.172 --> 12:05.342
Maggie, this is Ryan, this is
Allison, and this is Omar.

12:05.610 --> 12:08.279
Maggie: Did you gain some
weight? Or something else.

12:13.051 --> 12:14.385
This place must have cost a
fortune.

12:14.586 --> 12:16.854
Greg: I always expected I would
see you again.

12:17.055 --> 12:18.522
Greg: I just didn't think
it was going to be here.

12:18.723 --> 12:21.325
Well, surprise, I guess.

12:21.526 --> 12:24.328
I mean, I always figured you'd
end up at a place like this,
though.

12:24.529 --> 12:26.030
And?

12:26.231 --> 12:28.399
Yeah. You were always talking
about being a scientist.

12:28.600 --> 12:31.902
Trying to invent something to
save the planet.

12:33.238 --> 12:35.739
Yeah. And you were
always saying,

12:35.941 --> 12:40.110
"the only way to change
things, was to get out
there and fight".

12:40.312 --> 12:43.280
I guess not much has
changed there.

12:43.481 --> 12:46.951
Still. We both wanted the
same thing, right?

12:47.152 --> 12:48.385
Greg: A better world?

12:48.587 --> 12:52.756
Sure. Just different...
methodologies.

12:52.958 --> 12:56.794
We still ended up in
the same place.

12:57.062 --> 13:01.165
Maggie. Greg. Try to
keep up, please.

13:37.168 --> 13:38.903
<i>Dr. Nelson: In here we look very</i>
<i>closely to how pollution is</i>

13:39.104 --> 13:41.939
<i>affecting the habitats</i>
<i>surrounding the Garbage Patch.</i>

13:42.140 --> 13:46.977
<i>And what this means to the</i>
<i>animal life native to those</i>
<i>Eco-systems.</i>

13:50.015 --> 13:52.816
<i>Most organisms we across are</i>
<i>normal. But we've been seeing</i>

13:53.018 --> 13:55.953
<i>some anomalies appearing in some</i>
<i>of the creatures.</i>

13:56.154 --> 14:00.858
<i>Every 4th or 5th specimen we</i>
<i>pull out from the sea in this</i>
<i>are manifests a mutation.</i>

14:01.059 --> 14:03.227
<i>We keep them all here to study.</i>

14:05.797 --> 14:09.767
<i>But enough of that and</i>
<i>the facility. On to the people</i>
<i>that make it all happen.</i>

14:10.235 --> 14:15.372
Dr. Nelson: This is the Specimen
room. That's Betts and Sandoval
over there, hard at work.

14:15.573 --> 14:19.176
This is where we study animal
life native to the island and
the waters both below and

14:19.377 --> 14:21.278
around the Garbage Patch.

14:21.479 --> 14:24.682
Check their pollution levels,
look out for anomalies?

14:24.883 --> 14:26.617
You got it.

14:26.818 --> 14:29.787
Allison: Whoa, check these
out behind you.
Ryan: Weird.

14:29.988 --> 14:31.922
Omar: That's crazy.

14:37.762 --> 14:40.531
These are amazing.

14:40.732 --> 14:42.866
Did you guys notice
anything interesting?

14:43.068 --> 14:48.605
Yeah, they're mutations.
Really unique ones, from
the looks of things.

14:48.807 --> 14:50.874
Dr. Nelson: That's correct.

14:53.511 --> 14:59.717
Every fourth or fifth specimen
we pull from the ocean in this
area, manifest a mutation.

14:59.918 --> 15:01.452
We keep them all here to study.

15:01.653 --> 15:05.122
Maggie: That's the grim truth of
what pollution does.

15:06.624 --> 15:09.193
Well, one of the things, anyway.

15:09.394 --> 15:13.297
This is what happens when people
can just toss their garbage
wherever they want.

15:26.644 --> 15:30.514
For instance, take a look at
this turtle specimen.

15:30.715 --> 15:33.684
Exhibits the duel cranium
abnormality.

15:33.885 --> 15:36.020
Wow.

15:40.358 --> 15:41.692
Far out.

15:41.893 --> 15:44.161
Check out this little guy.

15:51.336 --> 15:53.570
Geez.

15:53.772 --> 15:55.472
Real nice place you
guys have here.

15:55.673 --> 15:58.575
Maggie: I don't know what's
going on or what's happening?

15:58.777 --> 16:00.944
Dr. Nelson: Something's riling
them up.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.348
What could be causing this?

16:04.549 --> 16:07.251
This sort of behaviors is
normally triggered by the
presence of a large predator.

16:07.452 --> 16:10.554
But this is a bit extreme,
obviously. Excuse me.

16:21.099 --> 16:23.100
Dr. Thomas: Hey Steve!

16:23.768 --> 16:25.769
How's it looking?

16:25.970 --> 16:29.440
The pollution levels at the
Patch are looking pretty
elevated today,

16:29.641 --> 16:32.209
Dr. Thomas: Huh.
Steve:... other than that,
everything seems fine.

16:32.410 --> 16:34.078
How are the new kids?

16:34.279 --> 16:36.080
They're wonderful.

16:36.314 --> 16:40.551
Sorry. I need to take this.
- Okay.

16:41.252 --> 16:43.487
Steve here.

16:43.688 --> 16:44.988
Dr. Nelson: Hey Steve, this is
Ted. We're down here in the
specimen room.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.890
Something's riling these
creatures pretty badly.

16:47.092 --> 16:49.159
Can you see if there's any
seismic activity happening?

16:49.360 --> 16:50.828
Any sort of weather anomaly?

16:51.029 --> 16:52.596
Steve: I'll give'er a look.
Give me two minutes.

16:52.797 --> 16:54.465
Okay, thanks.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.968
-What's up?

16:58.169 --> 17:02.339
That was the specimen room,
something's spooking the
mutations.

17:03.041 --> 17:08.579
Just checking the tectonic
plates activity, or maybe...

17:08.813 --> 17:10.079
That's weird.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.381
What do you have?

17:11.583 --> 17:15.085
Something big.
Right off the shoreline.

17:18.123 --> 17:20.757
Could it be a piece of the
Garbage Patch that broke off?

17:20.959 --> 17:23.493
Maybe something from the
current that's coming up?

17:23.694 --> 17:26.430
Steve: Nothing this big
would move so fast.

17:26.631 --> 17:28.599
Steve: I don't know what the
hell this is.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.968
It looks like it's
heading to the surface.

17:31.169 --> 17:33.303
I'm gonna go topside
and check it out, okay?

17:33.505 --> 17:37.040
Oh hey, Steve, enable low alert,
just in case.

17:37.242 --> 17:37.941
Okay.

18:03.801 --> 18:05.936
No way!

18:06.304 --> 18:08.338
Is that - is that a whale?

18:08.673 --> 18:10.307
All right!

18:28.626 --> 18:29.326
Professor!

18:29.527 --> 18:30.961
Something up?

18:31.162 --> 18:32.095
I don't know. Something
topside. Ted come with me.

18:32.297 --> 18:34.164
You guys, stay here.

18:43.074 --> 18:45.075
I mean, it seems like that's
where all the action is.

18:45.276 --> 18:46.476
That's what I'm
talking about.

18:46.678 --> 18:47.644
Let's go.

18:51.015 --> 18:52.716
Ah, dammit!

19:46.971 --> 19:49.773
Brad! Hey!

19:49.974 --> 19:51.742
Brad!
Get out of the water!

19:51.943 --> 19:53.410
Male: Brad! Did you ditch us?

19:53.611 --> 19:57.080
What? No man. I just left
something on the boat.

19:58.650 --> 20:00.617
Oh you guys just missed
it though.

20:00.818 --> 20:02.786
There was a big whale
or something out here,
a minute ago.

20:02.987 --> 20:04.888
Brad! Get out of
the water, now!

20:05.089 --> 20:07.824
Nah, it's fine Professor.
We've all kicked it with
whales before.

20:08.026 --> 20:10.060
Are you serious, Brad?

20:12.964 --> 20:14.064
Oh, hell yeah!

20:14.265 --> 20:15.599
Here it comes again.

20:15.800 --> 20:18.168
You guys gotta see the
size of this thing.

20:24.275 --> 20:25.942
What was that?

20:26.144 --> 20:27.811
I have no idea.

20:28.012 --> 20:29.479
Everybody, get
back inside.

20:29.681 --> 20:34.351
Brad, stop being an
idiot and get out
of the water.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.522
I don't think that's a whale.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.294
Oh!

20:44.495 --> 20:47.364
Brad!

20:47.632 --> 20:49.966
Maggie: Professor.
Dr. Thomas: We need to enable
higher safety protocols, now!

20:50.168 --> 20:52.302
Maggie: Everybody,
inside, now!

20:54.672 --> 20:57.374
Greg, come on!

21:13.925 --> 21:15.792
This is Brian.

21:15.993 --> 21:17.127
Brian, I need you to lock up
down there.

21:17.328 --> 21:19.496
Right. Okay.
I'll do the best I can.

21:40.585 --> 21:43.120
Come on.

22:07.712 --> 22:09.946
We've initiated stage one
safety protocol.

22:10.148 --> 22:13.183
We need to move on
to stage 2.
Someone just died.

22:14.752 --> 22:16.286
Attention Persephone.

22:16.487 --> 22:18.422
We are now moving to Stage 2
safety protocol.

22:18.623 --> 22:20.457
Complete lock down.

22:23.394 --> 22:26.229
Steve: Attention Coast
Guard, this is Persephone
Research Station 1.

22:26.431 --> 22:29.299
Requesting assistance
immediately. Over.

22:31.803 --> 22:36.039
Coast Guard, this is
Persephone. Requesting
immediate assistance. Over.

22:44.182 --> 22:45.315
Mayday! Mayday!

22:45.516 --> 22:48.118
Coast Guard? Anyone?
Do you copy?

22:50.354 --> 22:52.355
Something's jamming the signal.

22:52.557 --> 22:55.592
Elevated radiation levels
from the garbage patch.

22:55.793 --> 22:58.261
Steve: They play hell with the
radio signal from time to time.

22:58.463 --> 22:59.463
Not great timing,
Steve.

22:59.664 --> 23:01.598
Yeah. Tell me about it.

23:10.908 --> 23:14.077
Right. Um... So now what?
We just wait it out?

23:14.278 --> 23:15.779
We have ruptures in the hull.

23:15.980 --> 23:19.082
We're taking on water in some
places on main level 2.

23:19.283 --> 23:22.619
But it looks like we're working
on getting those sealed off.

23:22.820 --> 23:25.589
Okay. Stay on high alert. All of
you. Follow our safety-

23:25.790 --> 23:26.423
Professor.

23:26.624 --> 23:28.692
Professor, LOOK!

23:32.296 --> 23:34.130
It's building speed.

23:47.378 --> 23:48.879
This doesn't make sense.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.081
Sharks are hunters, but
this level of aggression?

23:51.282 --> 23:53.016
It's unheard of.

23:53.217 --> 23:55.552
Well, I've never heard
of a giant 3 headed
shark before, either.

23:55.753 --> 23:59.022
But, I guess all
bets are off at
this point.

24:07.231 --> 24:11.301
We got to seal this section
off before we take on too much
water! Come on!

24:11.502 --> 24:13.103
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

24:13.304 --> 24:14.538
Give me that radio.

25:03.354 --> 25:07.157
<i>...overload. Full evacuation</i>
<i>protocol initiated.</i>

25:07.358 --> 25:08.592
Holy Hell.

25:08.793 --> 25:10.260
We need to evacuate, now!

25:12.563 --> 25:15.765
Everyone try to remain calm.
Follow me.

25:17.768 --> 25:19.002
Remain calm?

25:19.203 --> 25:21.237
Come on!

25:21.439 --> 25:24.941
Dr. Nelson, get these kids up
top. Move! Go, go, go!

25:36.921 --> 25:39.322
Level 2-B, I got you
taking on water.

25:39.523 --> 25:43.126
Steve, A-4 is taking on water.
Way too much water.

25:43.327 --> 25:46.563
Brian: We're evacuating
down here. I'm going to try
to seal it off.

25:46.764 --> 25:49.466
You've gotta get out of
there, Brian. Get out!
Get out now, Brian!

25:49.667 --> 25:51.067
Brian: There's no way out. We-

25:54.105 --> 25:56.539
Level C? Anyone copy on level C?

25:56.741 --> 25:58.141
I've got fires all
over down there.

26:00.011 --> 26:00.510
Come in.

26:15.717 --> 26:19.186
-Drive!
-Yeah! Ryan!
Let's go, Ryan! Let's go!

26:19.721 --> 26:20.888
Greg: Get on the horn.

26:34.102 --> 26:36.070
Look how fast that
damn thing is.

26:36.271 --> 26:38.038
I don't know if we
can out run it.

26:38.239 --> 26:40.040
I guess we'll
find out.

26:44.079 --> 26:45.446
- I think the radio's working.
- Go, go, now!

26:48.283 --> 26:49.983
Mayday! Coast Guard?
Anyone there?

26:50.185 --> 26:52.586
Mayday! Coast Guard?
Is that you?

27:03.264 --> 27:05.499
Ryan: Mayday! Coast
Guard? Does anyone
read me?

27:05.700 --> 27:08.202
Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
Is anyone there?

27:08.436 --> 27:10.904
Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
Anybody? Help!

27:11.406 --> 27:14.074
Ryan: Mayday! Coast Guard?
Coast Guard, please?

27:14.275 --> 27:16.276
This is Max Burns.

27:18.213 --> 27:20.381
You're on the wrong frequency.

27:21.082 --> 27:23.550
Burns: You've reach a fishing
boat.

27:23.918 --> 27:26.487
Ryan: It doesn't matter. We need
help from someone. Anybody.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.990
We're coming from the Persephone
Research Station, near the
Garbage Patch.

27:30.191 --> 27:34.161
Ryan: The station's gone.
A lot of people are dead.
Can you help us?

27:35.797 --> 27:38.966
Whoa, whoa, slow down. What do
you mean, "attacked?" Over.

27:39.167 --> 27:44.271
My name is Ryan Bennett. I'm
hailing you from the Transport
vessel, Ps-001.

27:44.472 --> 27:48.542
Ryan: The station was attacked
by a giant...

27:48.877 --> 27:50.711
3 headed shark.

27:50.979 --> 27:53.280
Ryan: Destroyed the station.
Killed almost everyone.

27:53.615 --> 27:57.217
This better not be a joke.

27:57.419 --> 27:58.719
Over.

27:58.920 --> 28:00.387
Ryan: Listen, man,
I know how it sounds.

28:00.588 --> 28:02.956
But it's a giant 3 headed shark.

28:03.158 --> 28:06.460
It attacked the
station. It killed almost
everybody.

28:12.600 --> 28:16.437
Burns: A 3 headed shark? What
have you been smoking, kid?

28:16.638 --> 28:17.871
I don't know what you think you
saw, but-

28:18.072 --> 28:21.608
My friends are dead, man. Dead.

28:21.843 --> 28:24.545
You got to send someone, now.
Ships. The Navy. I don't care.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.381
Get somebody out here.
'Cause that thing is
right on top of us!

28:27.582 --> 28:29.516
Wait, wait, wait!
Where is it?

28:36.191 --> 28:37.458
It broke off.

28:37.659 --> 28:39.626
Ryan: Over there!

28:40.895 --> 28:42.029
Oh no.

28:42.230 --> 28:43.797
It's heading right
for that boat.

29:04.252 --> 29:08.355
Captain: Ha, these damn kids get
some crazy on these things.

29:08.556 --> 29:09.323
Crazy.

29:25.139 --> 29:26.573
Hey.

29:31.279 --> 29:32.546
There you go, sailors.

29:32.747 --> 29:34.581
Thank you, Tori.

29:40.288 --> 29:43.123
Come on, Mrs. Grant. You know
your money's no good here.

29:43.324 --> 29:46.226
I told you to
call me Rosemarie.

29:46.427 --> 29:48.228
"Mrs. Grant" makes me sound like
my mother.

29:49.931 --> 29:52.399
Okay, Rosemarie. Thanks.

30:21.296 --> 30:22.996
You gotta listen to us.

30:23.197 --> 30:24.565
That thing is headed for
another boat.

30:24.766 --> 30:27.200
Some kind of booze cruise. A lot
of passengers.

30:27.402 --> 30:29.069
You gotta come now because...

30:29.270 --> 30:30.704
they're all in danger.

30:37.111 --> 30:40.414
If you're making this up, kid,
it's your ass.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.749
Well, we're on our way.

30:42.951 --> 30:44.017
Let's go.

30:44.218 --> 30:45.252
Ship in distress.
- Let's go.

31:18.519 --> 31:19.987
I think I know
what's going on.

31:20.188 --> 31:21.822
What is it?

31:22.023 --> 31:24.191
It's being drawn
towards the pollution
of the larger vessel.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.061
What does that mean?

31:28.262 --> 31:30.263
It's making it insane.

31:30.898 --> 31:33.634
If it destroyed that island
and the research station,

31:33.835 --> 31:36.069
that yacht doesn't stand
a chance, does it?

31:36.270 --> 31:37.037
I'm afraid not.

31:44.579 --> 31:46.413
We have to do
something, you guys.

31:46.614 --> 31:47.981
We have to stop it.

31:48.182 --> 31:50.550
Stop it? Stop it with what?

31:50.752 --> 31:52.919
We don't have anything but
our wet clothes.

31:53.121 --> 31:56.123
We have to at least try to warn
that boat, if nothing else.

31:56.324 --> 31:58.091
We can't let it happen again.

31:58.292 --> 32:01.795
Not after we just watched
all our friends die.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.263
Greg: She's right.

32:03.531 --> 32:05.165
We have to try to warn them.

32:05.366 --> 32:07.067
Well, you've lost your mind.

32:07.268 --> 32:09.936
Greg: No. They're the ones
thinking with clear heads.

32:10.138 --> 32:13.907
We just watched all our
friends get eaten by that
monster. All of them.

32:14.275 --> 32:17.978
You guys want to save our own
asses, while we let innocent
people die?

32:18.813 --> 32:20.747
What if we can save them?

32:22.083 --> 32:23.650
All right.

32:28.523 --> 32:30.123
All right.

32:30.324 --> 32:31.825
Greg: Here we go.

33:30.818 --> 33:32.185
That's odd.

33:33.621 --> 33:36.356
Whale, maybe?

33:37.225 --> 33:41.128
The tour company didn't
say anything about
whale season.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.005
Ryan: Hey Burns.

33:52.206 --> 33:53.874
Burns? It's Ryan again.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.542
We're headed right for the boat.

34:00.114 --> 34:05.752
We're going to try to warn them
but, we can use your help as
soon as you can get here. Over.

34:06.521 --> 34:10.357
Earth Pact. On our way.
Hang tough.

34:11.726 --> 34:13.226
That is really good news.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.161
Just come as fast
as you can, okay?

34:44.292 --> 34:46.592
Snorkeler: A big shadow moved
past me under the water.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.995
Did you guys see anything
from up there?

35:10.518 --> 35:12.719
Female: What was that?

35:14.722 --> 35:16.756
Co-captain: It hit us pretty
hard. We're taking on water.

35:16.958 --> 35:19.426
Captain: Yeah, we've lost power
on the port side engine.

35:19.627 --> 35:22.863
You round out and check the
engine room, alert the crew, I'm
gonna call this in.

35:23.064 --> 35:24.831
Yes, sir.

35:25.900 --> 35:27.634
Mayday, mayday, mayday.

35:37.111 --> 35:39.946
We're going down. Need
assistance immediately.

35:59.166 --> 36:00.133
Oh my god!

36:05.339 --> 36:06.406
Hold on. Hold on.
- Howard.

36:26.861 --> 36:29.296
Hey, if I can have
everyone's attention,
please.

36:29.497 --> 36:32.432
We're going to pull anchor here
in just a couple minutes. The
Coast Guard is on their way.

36:32.633 --> 36:34.467
Captain, help us! Where are the
life rafts?!

36:34.669 --> 36:36.670
Captain: I'm sorry.
Male: We need to get
off this boat!

36:36.871 --> 36:38.438
Just tell us where they are?!

36:38.639 --> 36:40.941
Captain: I'm sorry, we don't
have anything.
Female: What?

36:41.142 --> 36:44.010
No life rafts?!
Are you kidding me?!

37:34.762 --> 37:36.062
Howard.

37:43.070 --> 37:44.170
I got you!

37:45.239 --> 37:46.539
Give me your hand.

37:46.741 --> 37:48.875
Rosemarie, give me
your hand.

37:49.610 --> 37:51.444
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

37:52.613 --> 37:54.447
I got you.

38:35.423 --> 38:36.756
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

38:36.957 --> 38:39.292
It's all good.
Don't mention it.

38:42.596 --> 38:44.931
- Oh.
- Oh shoot.

38:55.943 --> 38:57.610
Now what?

38:57.845 --> 38:59.412
We're a sitting duck down here.

38:59.613 --> 39:01.581
This heap's on its last legs.

39:01.782 --> 39:03.817
From the looks of this
thing, isn't doing any
better than we are.

39:04.018 --> 39:05.952
We're gonna do what we
came here to do.

39:06.153 --> 39:07.854
Try to help.

39:08.089 --> 39:09.923
Let's take that ladder
all the way up.

39:10.124 --> 39:11.524
Come on you guys.
Let's go.

40:02.243 --> 40:04.811
Rosemarie: Howard!

40:13.087 --> 40:14.354
Where did you guys come from?

40:14.555 --> 40:15.989
We-we were at a nearby
research station.

40:16.190 --> 40:19.025
That shark attacked us,
wrecked the whole place.

40:19.226 --> 40:22.195
We saw it coming this way and
tried to warn you guys, but...

40:22.396 --> 40:24.097
You were too late.

40:24.298 --> 40:27.767
Rosemarie: My fiancé, Howard.
-Relax. We have to rescue
Howard.

40:27.968 --> 40:29.269
Where is Howard?

40:29.470 --> 40:31.104
On the other side of this door.
It's locked.

40:31.305 --> 40:32.639
We don't have a lot of
time, you guys.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.940
What about life boats?

40:34.141 --> 40:35.275
There no life boats.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.943
Ryan: Your kidding me.
Maggie: Oh my god.

40:37.144 --> 40:39.412
Greg, how many people can fit on
the Earth Pact boat?

40:39.613 --> 40:40.980
Maybe 12. I don't know, the
engine's on it's last legs. You
know, any extra weigh-

40:41.182 --> 40:42.916
Howard!

40:43.984 --> 40:46.486
Fine, I'll go get him.
- I'm going with you.

40:46.687 --> 40:49.656
Fine, let's just be quick about
it. Greg, you stay here. Make
sure everyone stays safe.

40:49.857 --> 40:50.723
Be careful.

40:50.925 --> 40:52.492
Hey man, let me see that.

40:53.494 --> 40:54.994
I'm coming too.

40:55.262 --> 40:56.596
Step aside.

42:56.887 --> 42:59.222
Maggie: Its okay.
Its okay.

43:09.066 --> 43:10.733
I'm sorry.

43:13.170 --> 43:15.571
How's it looking?

43:16.507 --> 43:17.941
Not great.

43:18.142 --> 43:20.343
It's got maybe 20 miles, if
we're lucky.

43:21.045 --> 43:22.378
You're heading north?

43:22.579 --> 43:23.780
Yeah.

43:24.615 --> 43:26.916
And we're east
of Persephone?

43:27.151 --> 43:29.419
Yeah. I see it on
the left, why?

43:30.421 --> 43:31.487
Head north.

43:31.689 --> 43:33.056
North-west, now!

43:33.290 --> 43:34.123
And keep it floored.

43:34.325 --> 43:35.792
Are you sure?

43:35.993 --> 43:37.894
On the way to the
Persephone, I passed
a small atoll.

43:38.095 --> 43:40.229
Looked like a party
pier type of place.

43:40.431 --> 43:42.465
Should be 10, 15 miles out.

43:42.666 --> 43:44.233
Do you think we'll
be safe there?

43:44.435 --> 43:46.502
I think it's the
only land that we
can reach.

43:46.704 --> 43:49.238
Right now, it's the
only thing we have.

43:59.116 --> 44:00.183
Hold on.

44:09.827 --> 44:11.828
Engine's looking
rough, man.

44:12.029 --> 44:14.831
Yeah, yeah. I know.
Just got keep driving
till it gives out.

44:15.032 --> 44:18.201
Yeah, that's usually
my strategy.

44:19.036 --> 44:20.303
Hey!

44:21.805 --> 44:23.473
Heads up! That thing's
coming back guys.

44:25.676 --> 44:27.343
Doesn't that thing ever give up?

44:27.544 --> 44:28.845
Why should it?

44:29.113 --> 44:30.713
It's winning.

44:34.551 --> 44:37.053
There.
There it is!

44:43.827 --> 44:45.194
Think we'll make it?

44:45.396 --> 44:47.964
I'm gonna do everything
I possibly can.

45:00.144 --> 45:01.811
Hey, I think that's Burn's boat.

45:02.012 --> 45:03.246
Finally!

45:14.725 --> 45:16.859
We're almost there guys.
Get ready.

45:27.738 --> 45:29.572
Keep it steady.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.174
You got it.

45:31.408 --> 45:34.310
Send that thing back
to Hell, would you?

46:12.249 --> 46:13.683
This is our only
chance, you guys.

46:13.884 --> 46:15.485
We have to swim for it.

46:26.463 --> 46:30.266
<i>Mother of God!</i>

46:32.803 --> 46:34.570
Damn!

47:15.712 --> 47:17.313
Come on.

47:29.426 --> 47:31.027
On my mark...

47:31.461 --> 47:32.929
Open fire.

47:41.838 --> 47:42.505
Fire!

47:49.046 --> 47:51.581
Fire! Fire!
Let him have it!

47:59.356 --> 48:00.756
Unload!
Unload!

48:34.157 --> 48:36.125
Where'd it go?

48:36.326 --> 48:39.028
I-I think we got 'em!

49:04.921 --> 49:07.256
<i>Ay! In the name of God.</i>

51:17.587 --> 51:19.688
Sir? Are you okay?

51:19.890 --> 51:21.223
Yeah.

51:21.491 --> 51:22.725
Is everybody here, all right?

51:22.926 --> 51:25.327
Yeah.

51:28.365 --> 51:31.333
Okay as we're gonna be, i guess.

51:31.535 --> 51:33.436
I've never seen anything like
that before in my life.

51:44.781 --> 51:48.217
Who's is that?
Allison, come on!
Come on, Allison!

51:59.629 --> 52:00.563
Hey!

52:00.797 --> 52:02.331
Hey!

52:02.532 --> 52:03.766
Male: Is he gone?
- Who are you?

52:03.967 --> 52:04.767
Is he gone?

52:04.968 --> 52:06.569
Hey!

52:07.237 --> 52:08.838
How are you feeling?

52:09.039 --> 52:10.739
I feel like I just got
chased by a shark.

52:12.809 --> 52:15.644
- is he gone?
Stanley: Who are you?

52:15.846 --> 52:17.446
- is he gone? Is he gone?
Stanley: Who are you?

52:17.647 --> 52:21.317
Hey! Hey!
What happened here?

52:22.385 --> 52:23.786
Stanley: Jesus.

52:25.989 --> 52:28.757
You mean they can come this far
up the shore and do this kind of
damage?

52:28.959 --> 52:31.794
You've seen exactly
what It can do.

52:32.829 --> 52:35.631
That <i> thing</i> can get to us
no matter where we are.

52:36.166 --> 52:38.901
They how the hell
do we stop it?

52:44.574 --> 52:49.078
The only things we got going for
us right now are that, it can
stay out of water for too long.

52:49.279 --> 52:54.316
And as Dr. Nelson tried to
explain, it may need polluted
water to survive.

52:54.518 --> 52:56.886
And it maybe attracted
to to higher levels of
pollution.

52:57.087 --> 52:58.454
Right.

52:58.688 --> 53:00.656
Stanley: There's one more thing
you know know.

53:00.857 --> 53:04.527
It grows more heads every time
you cut one off.

53:06.663 --> 53:08.797
Like some damn hydra.

53:09.866 --> 53:12.735
That actually might be
something we can us.

53:12.936 --> 53:14.203
How?

53:14.404 --> 53:18.007
It's getting angrier.
More violent.

53:18.208 --> 53:20.376
You saw how each head was
fighting the other, back there.

53:20.577 --> 53:22.711
Stanley: Can we use that
against it?

53:24.114 --> 53:25.648
How long have you
been here?

53:25.849 --> 53:28.484
So it's not gone, is it?

53:31.821 --> 53:35.658
The-the thing that killed
everyone. The shark with
all the heads.

53:38.895 --> 53:40.195
It's not gone.

53:40.397 --> 53:42.031
Did you kill it?

53:43.033 --> 53:43.999
It-

53:44.234 --> 53:45.668
It's not good.

53:47.804 --> 53:50.072
We're all gonna die.

53:58.548 --> 54:00.282
How-how did you guys get here?

54:00.483 --> 54:03.919
Did you guys take a boat?
Did you guys get dropped off?

54:04.454 --> 54:07.256
We came in boats.

54:07.524 --> 54:08.357
Flat boats.

54:08.558 --> 54:09.124
Like Pontoons?

54:09.326 --> 54:10.526
Yeah. Pontoons.

54:10.727 --> 54:13.128
Whe - where the Pontoons?

54:13.330 --> 54:16.031
They docked them on the
other side of the island.

54:16.232 --> 54:17.066
Do you think they're still here?

54:17.267 --> 54:19.068
Are you kidding me?!

54:19.269 --> 54:23.038
I wasn't going outside
the cabana with that
thing still in the water.

54:25.675 --> 54:27.309
I just hide.

54:27.844 --> 54:29.778
Stayed as quiet
as I could.

54:29.980 --> 54:31.280
Till I heard voices.

54:31.481 --> 54:33.115
Where are the Pontoons?
Point them out.

54:33.316 --> 54:35.451
We can go, together.

54:39.389 --> 54:42.424
They're on the other
side of the island.

54:44.094 --> 54:45.761
Stanley: Where at?

54:46.029 --> 54:47.229
Over there.

54:47.430 --> 54:48.897
Are you sure?

54:49.099 --> 54:50.399
Pretty sure.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.868
All right guys, let's go.

55:21.464 --> 55:23.732
All right you guys. We
need to head out of here
as fast as we can.

55:23.933 --> 55:26.702
You four, take that boat.
Greg, Stanley, and I will take
the boat back here.

55:26.903 --> 55:29.872
Allison, check the engine.
- Got it. Guys get in.

55:46.756 --> 55:49.692
All right guys. If we're
gonna go, we better go.

55:49.893 --> 55:51.593
Let's go.
Allison!

55:51.795 --> 55:53.362
It's working!

55:53.563 --> 55:55.698
Do you hear that?

55:55.899 --> 55:57.366
Haul ass!

56:33.670 --> 56:35.504
Don't worry,
you're safe now.

56:35.705 --> 56:37.539
We'll be back
home in no time.

56:37.741 --> 56:39.141
Okay?

56:45.048 --> 56:47.883
We're gonna be okay.

56:48.084 --> 56:50.152
Rosemarie: No more sharks.

56:51.321 --> 56:53.188
Finally.

57:02.365 --> 57:03.599
Hey!

57:09.405 --> 57:11.540
Maggie: Allison!

57:13.276 --> 57:15.077
It's behind you!

57:15.478 --> 57:17.045
What are they trying to say?

57:17.247 --> 57:18.413
Shark!

57:18.982 --> 57:20.115
Look!

57:21.718 --> 57:22.818
What's wrong?

57:29.726 --> 57:31.393
Maggie: Allison!

57:33.863 --> 57:35.164
Shark!

57:41.070 --> 57:42.437
Allison!

57:42.705 --> 57:43.672
Guys!

57:54.960 --> 57:56.527
The garbage.

57:56.762 --> 57:59.297
It's been the pollution this
whole time.

58:00.165 --> 58:02.834
It's attracted to pollution.

58:03.969 --> 58:07.972
If we can somehow lead it back
to the Garbage Patch, maybe we
can kill it.

58:08.173 --> 58:11.142
Maggie: There will be so
much to eat, it will go into
a feeding frenzy.

58:11.343 --> 58:13.177
We'll get it to eat
itself alive.

58:13.379 --> 58:14.579
How fast can you get back there?

58:14.780 --> 58:17.415
Hopefully fast enough.

58:17.850 --> 58:22.320
That party is what, 10, 15
miles from the patch?
-Yeah.

58:22.521 --> 58:24.288
We're already halfway there.

58:24.623 --> 58:25.790
Hey guys?

58:26.759 --> 58:28.493
Look at all this garbage.

58:29.928 --> 58:31.863
Should be able to eat it the
whole way back.

58:32.564 --> 58:36.167
That's perfect. Come on, Greg.
Let's drive. Go!
-Yeah.

58:57.189 --> 58:59.323
Hey! It's working!

59:00.826 --> 59:02.994
You got it! Keep going.
- Go, go, go.

59:05.297 --> 59:07.365
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
We're almost there!

59:27.219 --> 59:28.786
It got 'em!
Maggie!

59:29.021 --> 59:30.421
Go, go, go!

59:30.756 --> 59:32.190
Maggie: Stanley!

59:32.558 --> 59:33.524
Stanley!

59:37.196 --> 59:39.263
Relax.
Relax.

59:40.699 --> 59:44.502
Sorry. It ate the last bag.
- It's okay.

59:45.270 --> 59:47.171
We ran out of garbage.

59:47.539 --> 59:49.440
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

59:49.608 --> 59:52.810
He ate the last one.
I think we lost him.

59:52.978 --> 59:55.012
Don't worry,
We'll get him!

01:00:00.919 --> 01:00:04.155
Hold it tight, keep
the pressure on.

01:00:08.093 --> 01:00:09.660
Hey, he's still
a shark, right?

01:00:09.828 --> 01:00:12.697
Yeah. Sit.
Stanley, relax!

01:00:12.965 --> 01:00:17.835
Fueled by garbage and pollution,
right?
-Yes. Stanley, what are you
doing?

01:00:21.173 --> 01:00:23.341
I'm not gonna
make it anyway.
What?

01:00:23.509 --> 01:00:24.509
Stanley! No!

01:00:24.676 --> 01:00:27.645
No, no, no, no!
Stanley! No!

01:00:38.323 --> 01:00:39.824
Wait, wait, wait!
What are you doing?

01:00:39.992 --> 01:00:41.425
I'm gonna go save him!
- Maggie, No! Listen!

01:00:41.593 --> 01:00:43.327
Remember you told me that
I was always a fighter?

01:00:43.495 --> 01:00:44.695
You've done enough today.

01:00:44.863 --> 01:00:46.297
It's my turn.

01:00:47.165 --> 01:00:48.633
Greg: I'll get him back!

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.736
Stanley: Get back in the boat!
I got this!

01:00:56.942 --> 01:00:59.377
Greg: Stanley! get back here!

01:00:59.545 --> 01:01:01.712
Maggie: Stanley! Come back!

01:01:10.889 --> 01:01:14.825
Greg: It's too dangerous!
Stanley: I think it's working.
Maggie: Turn back now!

01:01:14.993 --> 01:01:17.061
Stanley: The shark is starting
to follow.

01:01:21.033 --> 01:01:22.600
Greg: Don't do this!
Stanley: Take care of Maggie.

01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:28.105
Greg!

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.202
Greg: Stanley!

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.706
Stanley.

01:02:20.387 --> 01:02:21.854
Oh my god.

01:02:22.188 --> 01:02:23.789
Greg: The shark!

01:02:51.484 --> 01:02:53.218
Oh, damn!

01:02:53.587 --> 01:02:55.754
Greg! Hurry! Come back!
Hurry!

01:03:09.569 --> 01:03:12.071
Hurry! Swim!
Swim! Swim!

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:15.841
Maggie: Greg! Swim! Hurry!
Hurry up! Swim!

01:04:05.792 --> 01:04:09.561
Maggie: Greg! Now's your chance.
Get back onto the boat!

01:04:58.278 --> 01:05:01.080
It's working!
It's working!

01:05:06.286 --> 01:05:07.553
Oh!
- You did it!

01:05:11.224 --> 01:05:12.591
Maggie: You did it.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.067
Sit down.

01:05:32.078 --> 01:05:33.746
We did it.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.892
Get your feet out the water.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:47.659
Out the water.
