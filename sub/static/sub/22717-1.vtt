00:36.544 --> 00:41.379
This man has been brought to me
as one who misleads the people.

00:42.750 --> 00:47.653
He is accused of sedition and blasphemy,
for which he should suffer death.

01:01.469 --> 01:04.266
My Lord Governor!

01:10.278 --> 01:11.506
My Lord Governor...

01:14.682 --> 01:18.743
...there is a custom in Jerusalem,
that at this season of the feast...

01:18.820 --> 01:21.482
...one condemned man should be released.

01:21.589 --> 01:23.454
I remember the custom.

01:23.524 --> 01:27.324
Who shall it be?
This man who many of you call their king?

01:28.196 --> 01:30.130
Or shall it be Barabbas?

01:31.299 --> 01:32.994
Release Barabbas!

01:35.136 --> 01:39.266
. Release Jesus of Nazareth!
. No, not Barabbas!

01:44.779 --> 01:48.374
. Barabbas!
. Release Barabbas! Crucify the Nazarene!

01:49.617 --> 01:52.711
They're mad, Lord Governor.
Barabbas is a rebel.

01:52.987 --> 01:54.818
A robber, an assassin.

01:56.791 --> 01:58.053
Release Barabbas!

03:30.251 --> 03:33.914
Take the Nazarene,
scourge him and bring him here again...

03:34.288 --> 03:35.949
...and he shall be crucified.

04:26.107 --> 04:27.836
All right, that's enough.

04:28.142 --> 04:29.131
Take him out.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.954
Open up.

05:03.244 --> 05:04.404
Come on.

05:18.559 --> 05:20.550
One man to be set free.

05:22.330 --> 05:23.661
Set free?

05:24.832 --> 05:27.699
You ought to know the custom
of the season.

05:27.768 --> 05:30.396
The Governor offered them
either the prophet or you.

05:31.005 --> 05:33.269
He listened to the voices
and they chose you.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.368
I make no comment.
Come on. Get on the move.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.911
All right.

05:56.397 --> 05:58.092
Give us a hair of your beard.

05:59.367 --> 06:02.962
It ought to be lucky,
considering how things have gone for you.

06:10.878 --> 06:14.279
I'm not used to the light. It plays tricks.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.880
If I was you, I shouldn't loiter.

06:17.952 --> 06:21.444
I'd want to see the back of this place
before they change their minds.

06:22.623 --> 06:24.090
Get on your way, will you?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.992
. Who do you think you're shoving?
. Get going.

06:28.095 --> 06:29.960
All right. I'm going.

06:40.274 --> 06:41.571
Move on.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.328
. There he is. Release the Nazarene!
. Get out of the way.

07:10.471 --> 07:15.033
What are you standing for, like an idiot?
What are you all hanging around for?

07:58.552 --> 08:01.646
Here's a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody's moved.

08:02.390 --> 08:04.688
What's happened then?
How did you get out?

08:06.093 --> 08:08.027
This is a surprise, let me tell you.

08:08.095 --> 08:09.995
Is that my duck? It's him!

08:10.064 --> 08:12.555
. Sara!
. There's the black knave himself...

08:12.700 --> 08:14.031
...come back to his own.

08:14.101 --> 08:18.504
Cheating his death again, like a good boy.
The clever one. How did you do it?

08:18.572 --> 08:22.838
I was released to celebrate the holiday
as a surprise for you.

08:23.344 --> 08:27.280
Here's a day to celebrate in all my god.
Come on and tell us the whole story.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.542
You've not heard?
I'm the choice of the people.

08:29.617 --> 08:32.552
"Give us Barabbas," they said.
Give me some food.

08:32.686 --> 08:35.246
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.187
How does it feel?
How did you feel when they told you?

08:38.259 --> 08:39.919
The choice of the people, eh?

08:40.861 --> 08:44.922
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast
all the slopping wine got watered.

08:45.032 --> 08:47.762
. Where did you get your luck?
. What witch gave you that?

08:47.868 --> 08:48.960
Pass him across to me!

08:49.070 --> 08:52.801
. Touch him for luck. That's it.
. I'm not taking chances.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.432
Get away.

08:57.445 --> 08:58.434
Where's Rachel?

08:58.546 --> 09:00.912
Shut away mourning for me?
Fetch her down here.

09:00.981 --> 09:02.744
She's no good for you or anyone else.

09:02.817 --> 09:06.947
. She's completely changed, I'm telling you.
. What's wrong with her? Bring her down.

09:07.054 --> 09:10.888
She's no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night...

09:10.991 --> 09:14.449
...except this prophet from Nazareth,
who's on trial for blasphemy.

09:14.762 --> 09:17.788
Ever since she heard him preach,
she has gone off her life...

09:17.932 --> 09:19.957
...like a sick child goes off its food.

09:20.968 --> 09:24.802
Come on, you old empty belly.
There's no food inside you worth vomiting.

09:25.239 --> 09:26.672
Sit down and eat.

09:27.842 --> 09:29.833
Barabbas, that girl's no good for you.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.606
Take my word for it.
As morbid as a crow in a chimney.

09:32.680 --> 09:35.478
Bewitched by a prophet.
A waste of a handsome girl.

09:35.583 --> 09:38.746
And she's gone to his trial
looking like a widow already.

09:38.819 --> 09:41.913
She knows what happened to her prophet.
That's the end of him.

09:42.022 --> 09:43.990
. Condemned, was he?
. That's just it.

09:44.091 --> 09:48.084
They had the choice between him and me,
and they chose me. How do you like that?

09:48.295 --> 09:50.786
The idol of the city.

09:51.332 --> 09:54.267
Tell you what.
You're as good as a king, Barabbas.

09:54.335 --> 09:57.668
They call the prophet King of the Jews,
but they chose you.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.602
Show your respects to King Barabbas.

09:59.673 --> 10:02.198
. Let's have a crowning of him.
. Yes!

10:06.981 --> 10:10.439
. The wicked old King of Judea.
. What are you doing?

10:19.527 --> 10:24.464
. Come on, give him his robes.
. You be nice to your King Barabbas.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.335
More wives than Solomon
and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.

10:31.472 --> 10:33.565
Here's your scepter. Take it.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.539
Set him on his throne.

10:35.910 --> 10:38.743
. What's that?
. That's the scepter.

10:39.079 --> 10:40.637
Sit down on your throne.

10:40.714 --> 10:44.844
Kneel down, all you miserable scum
of the earth, and acknowledge.

10:45.085 --> 10:47.019
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.

10:47.087 --> 10:48.816
Hail! Hail!

10:49.056 --> 10:52.548
I'll make laws for you
that will tax your constitutions.

10:53.527 --> 10:55.654
I crown you, King Barabbas.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.371
What are you treating me like a clown for?

11:12.780 --> 11:14.839
Here she is, Barabbas, if you want her.

11:17.117 --> 11:20.245
Look here, Rachel,
look who's been asking for you.

11:20.354 --> 11:22.288
The old rascal back from the dead.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.786
So, here she is.

11:28.729 --> 11:32.187
What's the matter with me?
Why don't you look at me?

11:32.933 --> 11:34.264
Barabbas, let me go.

11:34.368 --> 11:36.700
Not until you've told me
you're glad I'm alive.

11:36.770 --> 11:40.570
. I wouldn't wish any man his death.
. What do you mean by that?

11:40.641 --> 11:42.768
Don't make me speak to you.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.906
. What do you mean by that?
. Don't make me speak to you.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.743
That's a warm welcome.

11:48.616 --> 11:50.277
I couldn't follow any further.

11:50.384 --> 11:53.945
I daren't say what is still to come,
but God forgive us all if he can.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.986
What did I tell you?
She's no good to you now, Barabbas.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.582
Come on.

12:14.808 --> 12:17.299
I'm not here to be made a fool of.

12:18.479 --> 12:20.242
What's the matter?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.086
Remember how it used to be.

12:26.153 --> 12:30.453
Barabbas, don't you see what's happening?
Don't you understand what set you free?

12:31.191 --> 12:33.125
I just got out of prison.

12:34.762 --> 12:38.027
I need to get the cramp out of my bones.
That's what's happened.

12:41.669 --> 12:46.800
. I'm not the same. Nothing is the same.
. You'd better try and make it the same.

12:47.841 --> 12:50.935
Barabbas, listen to me.
For pity's sake believe me.

12:51.779 --> 12:54.714
He came from God,
the man who's taking your place.

12:55.549 --> 12:58.177
You think I should have been killed
instead of him?

12:58.352 --> 13:00.013
You think I ought to be dead?

13:00.120 --> 13:03.112
Barabbas, hear what I say.
He came from God.

13:04.525 --> 13:07.961
That's none of my worry.
God can look after his own.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.723
. And you can look after me.
. No!

13:10.497 --> 13:13.694
That girl up there was always coming back
with strange ideas.

13:13.801 --> 13:15.666
She's got her head full of them.

13:15.736 --> 13:19.729
Well, it seems she's got something
to think about now, anyway.

13:20.641 --> 13:24.133
. I don't like the look of it.
. Look of what? What's the matter?

13:24.211 --> 13:26.202
The sky. The light's gone out of it.

13:42.062 --> 13:45.361
I've never known it dark like this
in the middle of the day.

13:46.166 --> 13:48.396
Get a light, for mercy's sake.

15:05.779 --> 15:07.974
Something's wrong with my eyes.

15:09.817 --> 15:11.250
I can't see.

15:15.756 --> 15:17.018
Something's wrong.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.793
Everything's black.

15:23.030 --> 15:24.622
Black as death.

15:25.432 --> 15:28.128
I knew there was something wrong
when I saw that light.

15:28.936 --> 15:31.029
Tell me. Am I going blind?

15:31.338 --> 15:33.135
Am I going blind?

15:46.720 --> 15:48.449
What's happening?

15:51.024 --> 15:52.548
You know what has happened.

15:52.659 --> 15:56.220
Even the light has left us,
now that we've killed him.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.258
Well, are you satisfied now?

19:49.096 --> 19:52.031
He's dead.
Just the same as any other man.

19:53.700 --> 19:57.067
. We've seen it. That's the end of it.
. He promised to come back.

19:57.137 --> 19:58.627
We shall see that, too.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.299
Only two days
and he'll be in the world again.

20:01.408 --> 20:03.808
Look at his friends.
You think they believe it?

20:03.910 --> 20:06.435
I tell you, you're mad. That's the end of it.

20:06.546 --> 20:09.140
Not tomorrow, but the morning after.

20:47.988 --> 20:49.819
How many days have I been here?

21:10.777 --> 21:12.472
How many days have I been here?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.049
Can't you hear me?

21:19.152 --> 21:20.710
What's the matter with you?

21:21.054 --> 21:23.488
What's the matter? Two days.

21:25.058 --> 21:26.389
Two days.

21:35.068 --> 21:37.366
Then today's the third day?

21:37.971 --> 21:41.031
Two and one make three. What's so odd?

21:42.008 --> 21:43.305
We'll see, then.

21:44.744 --> 21:47.474
This is the morning of the third day.

21:50.050 --> 21:52.382
Barabbas, where are you going?

22:55.282 --> 22:56.749
Now you know it's true.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.384
All I know is the tomb is empty.

23:03.056 --> 23:05.217
. Who moved the stone?
. God moved it.

23:10.063 --> 23:12.497
God himself? You saw him do it?

23:13.566 --> 23:15.295
A power came from the sky.

23:15.402 --> 23:18.428
It was when the sun was rising,
at the beginning of the day.

23:18.505 --> 23:20.666
. First there was the music of a horn.
. Horn?

23:20.774 --> 23:22.605
Then in the air there was an angel.

23:23.243 --> 23:25.177
The whole sky seemed to dismantle.

23:25.812 --> 23:29.248
It was white, it was fire.

23:29.649 --> 23:31.310
It was white fire.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.118
He stretched out his arm.
It seemed as long as a spear.

23:35.188 --> 23:38.680
The point of the spear
went between the stone and the rock...

23:38.792 --> 23:40.487
...and the stone rolled away.

23:42.295 --> 23:45.787
If only you had been here sooner
and seen what I saw.

23:46.166 --> 23:49.192
My eyes are good.
They see nothing but real things.

23:49.302 --> 23:51.327
You have to believe this, Barabbas.

23:51.805 --> 23:55.434
The Master was a man of truth,
and he said this would be so.

23:55.875 --> 23:58.275
Did you see a prophet come
out of the tomb?

23:58.478 --> 24:00.503
My eyes were so dazzled.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.305
I think I must have covered them.

24:04.517 --> 24:06.212
But when I could see again...

24:06.386 --> 24:10.117
...a man and a woman were together
in the garden. Then the woman was alone.

24:10.223 --> 24:12.623
And then she went quickly away.

24:12.892 --> 24:15.383
And the man was the same man
they buried in there?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.555
He was like a shadow.

24:18.665 --> 24:22.465
The morning light was behind him.
But I'm sure it was he.

24:22.669 --> 24:25.968
Shadows, light, that's about the truth of it.

24:26.306 --> 24:27.705
Here's the truth of it:

24:28.408 --> 24:30.808
Why do you think he should lie
about himself...

24:30.877 --> 24:32.742
...when it meant he would be killed?

24:33.747 --> 24:35.374
How do you know what he said?

24:35.482 --> 24:38.974
The priests ought to know more
than you do. And they call it blasphemy.

24:40.320 --> 24:41.514
He said:

24:42.756 --> 24:44.018
"Love one another."

24:45.992 --> 24:47.584
"Love one another"?

24:49.529 --> 24:51.929
And they crucified him for that?

24:52.432 --> 24:54.263
Where are you going?

24:56.569 --> 24:58.594
There are those who can tell you more.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.674
There's a house in the street of the potters
where they meet.

25:01.741 --> 25:04.175
You may find them there.
Go and ask them.

25:04.244 --> 25:05.836
It's a trick they're playing.

25:05.912 --> 25:08.710
They took the body and hid it
to go on with their story.

25:08.782 --> 25:10.249
Or are you afraid?

25:10.350 --> 25:12.580
Are you afraid of knowing
what has happened?

25:42.649 --> 25:44.913
Are you looking for someone?

25:47.053 --> 25:48.486
You like to see it?

25:49.823 --> 25:51.450
The clay making itself?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.257
Some other day.

25:57.130 --> 25:59.121
What's happened? I heard there was news.

25:59.232 --> 26:01.598
The tomb's empty,
the women said they saw him.

26:01.668 --> 26:05.468
Creed can have strange visions.
Only it's true. Where's Peter?

26:37.837 --> 26:39.498
Who could it be?

26:40.006 --> 26:41.473
Don't open it.

26:41.541 --> 26:45.170
We should get out of this city.
Wiser to go down to Galilee.

26:45.278 --> 26:49.510
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let's see what is here.

26:49.616 --> 26:51.345
What if they mean to destroy us all?

26:51.451 --> 26:53.783
Leaving no one to tell the knowledge
of the man.

26:53.853 --> 26:57.220
Can the word turn to silence?
I'm not afraid of that.

27:02.562 --> 27:03.961
Where is he?

27:05.632 --> 27:08.658
. What have you done with him?
. What do you want with us?

27:08.735 --> 27:12.569
. The truth. What happened?
. What right have you to be here?

27:12.672 --> 27:14.196
You know what I mean.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.167
What are you all afraid of?

27:20.813 --> 27:22.713
What are we afraid of?

27:25.051 --> 27:27.417
You want to know what we want to know.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.011
. What is the truth of this morning?
. I know the truth.

27:31.357 --> 27:32.756
You stole the body.

27:33.159 --> 27:36.026
You think we might have hidden it
here among us.

27:36.095 --> 27:38.529
But something else has happened.

27:38.665 --> 27:42.328
If you find him here,
it will only be if he comes himself.

27:42.869 --> 27:45.667
Through that gate, as you did just now.

27:47.006 --> 27:50.942
Don't you believe it. I saw the body.
He was a dead man.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.569
If you were sure of that,
you wouldn't be here.

27:54.113 --> 27:55.102
He's risen.

27:56.282 --> 27:58.773
I trust in him and wait.

28:05.024 --> 28:06.582
You're all mad.

28:09.963 --> 28:12.625
What do you think you're doing,
making that net?

28:12.966 --> 28:15.526
There's no sea to fish in
closer than Galilee.

28:15.735 --> 28:18.431
It's what I'm used to doing,
my hands go to it.

28:18.605 --> 28:21.938
But the streets in the cities
have to be the sea for me now.

28:22.408 --> 28:25.400
He made a joke about it
when he took us away from the boats.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.806
He said that in the future
our fish would be men.

28:32.585 --> 28:33.984
It was a serious joke.

28:34.621 --> 28:38.421
It meant he'd given us the word
to draw men out of the dark sea...

28:39.058 --> 28:40.218
...into the light.

28:40.293 --> 28:42.784
And you call yourself a fisherman?

28:42.895 --> 28:45.227
Do I have to tell you
what happens to the fish?

28:45.298 --> 28:47.994
They struggle about, gasp and die.

28:48.968 --> 28:52.665
We struggle and gasp.
You said something good.

28:57.010 --> 28:58.307
Poor fish.

28:59.979 --> 29:01.071
I, too...

29:02.415 --> 29:03.939
...must struggle and gasp.

29:04.150 --> 29:05.515
And die.

29:08.254 --> 29:10.313
And die in order to live.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.790
That's where men have the advantage
over fish.

29:16.129 --> 29:18.996
They can die to the world,
die to the dark sea...

29:19.299 --> 29:21.767
...and begin to live again in the light.

29:21.834 --> 29:25.600
That's what he promised,
and what he promised has happened.

29:26.372 --> 29:28.033
But what has happened...

29:29.542 --> 29:31.339
...we still don't know.

29:31.978 --> 29:33.605
He's come back to life.

29:34.347 --> 29:37.874
. He'll lead us to the new kingdom.
. I'll believe it when he's before us.

29:37.984 --> 29:40.179
When I can touch him and hear him.

29:40.286 --> 29:42.618
You're always full of doubts
without any cause.

29:42.689 --> 29:45.556
No cause to doubt
that a dead man can come back to life?

29:45.658 --> 29:46.682
No cause.

29:47.727 --> 29:50.321
I can take you now to talk with a man
who was dead.

29:50.563 --> 29:53.498
The Master brought him back to life.
Thomas knows him well.

29:54.867 --> 29:56.300
Come, talk to him.

29:56.703 --> 29:57.863
Let him tell you.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.371
You needn't be afraid.

30:24.831 --> 30:27.425
Lazarus? Will you come to us?

30:28.201 --> 30:30.169
Here's someone wants to question you.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.229
Come in.

30:38.444 --> 30:39.843
I'll leave you with him.

30:41.447 --> 30:43.415
You can ask him whatever you like.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.483
They told me death is not...

31:20.753 --> 31:22.050
Is not death.

31:23.556 --> 31:25.547
They brought me here to see...

31:26.659 --> 31:28.820
...because you could make me believe it.

31:31.664 --> 31:35.600
Because you were dead,
and were raised from the dead by the man.

31:36.502 --> 31:37.628
I mean...

31:38.471 --> 31:39.563
...the Master.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.435
That is true.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.408
I was dead.

31:49.916 --> 31:51.941
And I know that he is Christ...

31:52.785 --> 31:54.082
...the Son of God...

31:54.987 --> 31:57.353
...who has power over life and death.

31:58.491 --> 31:59.822
What's it like there?

32:00.626 --> 32:02.423
You were there.

32:04.096 --> 32:06.087
. Tell me what it's like.
. Like?

32:06.966 --> 32:09.161
. Like?
. Yes, what is it...

32:10.269 --> 32:12.499
...this thing you experienced?

32:14.273 --> 32:15.365
What is it?

32:16.609 --> 32:18.201
I have experienced nothing.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.170
Only death.

32:22.548 --> 32:24.015
And death is nothing.

32:25.384 --> 32:26.442
Nothing?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.108
No.

32:29.622 --> 32:30.884
What should it be?

32:37.730 --> 32:41.029
You want me to tell you
about the realm of the dead?

32:41.667 --> 32:42.964
I cannot.

32:44.971 --> 32:47.838
How would you tell an unborn child
what life is?

32:50.376 --> 32:51.673
It exists.

32:52.745 --> 32:54.212
But it isn't anything.

32:56.649 --> 32:58.241
To those who've been there...

32:59.719 --> 33:02.051
...nothing else is anything either.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.585
No one has asked me this before.

33:10.696 --> 33:14.427
They have listened how life came back
to me and gone away praising.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.667
Only you have asked about death.

33:18.938 --> 33:20.337
And none the wiser.

33:31.417 --> 33:33.248
We're two men who might be dead.

33:38.057 --> 33:39.615
Sharing his body.

33:41.627 --> 33:42.685
Life.

34:07.119 --> 34:08.609
Love one another.

34:08.955 --> 34:12.254
Listen, everybody! That's the word.
Love one another!

34:16.629 --> 34:19.324
We can tell them about loving one another.

34:19.465 --> 34:24.232
. Leave me alone. I want to sit.
. What do you want to do, sit and think?

34:24.303 --> 34:26.237
It's no good thinking.

34:26.505 --> 34:29.906
Come on, let's go and find a new life.

34:38.618 --> 34:43.453
. Where are you going, Barabbas?
. To see what "brought back to life" means.

34:44.924 --> 34:46.482
Love one another!

34:56.636 --> 34:58.467
. Come on.
. My shoe.

35:07.613 --> 35:08.637
Look.

35:32.038 --> 35:35.633
. Hey! Get up! Come on!
. Leave it alone.

36:25.191 --> 36:26.419
Stay alive.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.854
It's all you have to do.

36:37.036 --> 36:39.436
It's not my fault they let him get killed.

36:40.940 --> 36:43.306
You can't hang it around my neck.

36:44.143 --> 36:46.976
I've as much right to be alive
as any of you.

36:47.213 --> 36:49.238
You stinking fish.

36:49.315 --> 36:52.876
You're afraid to look at me
because I'm alive.

36:56.222 --> 36:58.952
You, look at me. Look at me!

37:12.004 --> 37:14.404
It may be today that the new world comes.

37:14.473 --> 37:18.603
Today or tomorrow.
But it will come, you will see.

37:19.111 --> 37:22.342
Every day you have promised us,
it has never come.

37:23.082 --> 37:26.176
. It will never come.
. It will come. I know it.

37:26.285 --> 37:29.743
Please, Rachel,
tell us again what it will be like.

37:29.922 --> 37:31.822
You'd better mind what you say.

37:31.924 --> 37:34.688
Don't you know what can happen to you
if they hear you?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.319
Anybody now caught
spreading such stories...

37:37.429 --> 37:42.162
...the Son of God, the Messiah and such,
is to be judged an enemy of the State...

37:42.501 --> 37:44.662
...and stoned until he's dead.

37:50.476 --> 37:55.038
It will be as though the Earth has become
like a star burned clean.

37:55.614 --> 37:57.775
Everything evil swept away.

37:58.350 --> 38:02.616
We shall look up and there will be angels
coming down from the sky...

38:03.189 --> 38:07.649
...and they will put food in front of us
and perhaps new clothes to wear.

38:08.194 --> 38:13.188
White, like their own.
Or some blue, like the color of the sky.

38:17.570 --> 38:22.667
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground,
and everything will be made new...

38:23.709 --> 38:27.201
...because the Son of God has risen
from the dead.

38:28.547 --> 38:30.412
The world has become his kingdom.

38:30.516 --> 38:33.076
There's no truth in any of it.

38:34.386 --> 38:36.149
I know this woman.

38:36.422 --> 38:39.550
She doesn't know the difference
between what is real...

38:41.227 --> 38:44.094
...and what she dreamed in her sleep.

38:44.396 --> 38:45.829
Don't you listen to her.

38:45.931 --> 38:49.059
She's raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.

38:49.168 --> 38:50.328
Trouble for you...

38:50.402 --> 38:53.428
...if you won't turn and listen to the sounds
that have come.

38:53.606 --> 38:56.268
He knows but is afraid to believe it.

38:56.609 --> 39:00.568
Look at you, Barabbas.
How can you see or hear what's to come?

39:00.779 --> 39:03.543
It will happen,
whether you take part in it or not.

39:03.616 --> 39:07.518
He's right. It's dangerous talk.
They'll pull down our homes, drive us out.

39:07.586 --> 39:09.178
Better listen to this man.

39:09.255 --> 39:12.713
. Let's hear what the prophet said.
. Don't leave. Where are you going?

39:12.791 --> 39:16.852
To where the lepers are, to tell them
to be ready for the freedom that's coming.

39:16.929 --> 39:19.625
. She's going among the lepers!
. Stop her!

39:19.732 --> 39:21.597
She's going to set the lepers free.

39:21.767 --> 39:25.362
. Don't let her go among the lepers!
. Don't let her set the lepers free!

39:29.575 --> 39:31.736
You have no right to go among the lepers!

39:34.246 --> 39:36.305
Look out, it's a temple guard!

39:39.585 --> 39:41.450
We don't want the lepers to be free!

39:41.553 --> 39:43.885
A charge has been lodged
against this woman.

39:43.956 --> 39:47.949
. She must be questioned.
. We heard she preaches blasphemy.

39:48.227 --> 39:50.491
Bring her to the temple
and we will judge her.

39:51.563 --> 39:55.329
. Take your dirty hands off her.
. Don't take her! She's done no wrong.

39:56.101 --> 39:57.568
Don't take her away.

40:03.342 --> 40:04.934
Rachel!

40:59.064 --> 41:04.127
For blasphemy, and spreading blasphemy,
this woman is condemned.

41:04.536 --> 41:07.004
For stirring up evil matters
among the people...

41:07.740 --> 41:11.005
...for misleading their minds
and denying the wisdom of authority.

41:12.211 --> 41:15.874
For her sins, she has been condemned
to death by stoning.

41:17.182 --> 41:21.346
Let the man who accused her
and was found just in his accusation...

41:21.687 --> 41:23.552
...cast the first stone.

41:29.895 --> 41:31.487
What must I do?

41:32.398 --> 41:35.026
Take this stone.
Come on. Throw it at her.

41:35.267 --> 41:36.734
Why should I throw?

41:37.102 --> 41:39.696
. I've nothing against her.
. You accused her.

41:39.772 --> 41:42.206
. The law gives you the first stone.
. It was you.

41:42.274 --> 41:44.435
Or you'll find yourself there beside her.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.205
Throw quickly. If you wait, I may be afraid.

43:42.961 --> 43:46.556
You don't have to think of Barabbas
any more. He's not coming back.

43:46.798 --> 43:49.062
And if he did,
we'd know what to do with him.

43:49.501 --> 43:53.528
You're still afraid of him because
he used to roar at you like a brass bull.

43:53.639 --> 43:56.403
You can't stand up to him
even when he's gone.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.908
He's gone to the devil once and for all,
I can tell you.

43:59.678 --> 44:00.975
He's lost his nerve.

44:01.046 --> 44:03.742
He's creeping about the city
like a shivering priest.

44:03.849 --> 44:07.683
Why do you think he's not come back?
Because he's afraid to stir hand or foot.

44:08.187 --> 44:12.021
. We don't know yet, he won't come back.
. Who cares if he does?

44:12.257 --> 44:14.851
We got a man here who can hang him
in his own guts.

44:14.927 --> 44:17.657
He came out of that prison mad.
Acquitted but mad.

44:17.729 --> 44:19.560
We'll soon see it then.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.795
So, you remembered the way to get here.

44:57.469 --> 44:59.733
Given you up this past week.

45:02.874 --> 45:05.035
You'll find things altered.

45:20.926 --> 45:22.757
What's over is over.

45:27.666 --> 45:29.293
I remembered the way.

45:45.784 --> 45:47.012
Bring them across.

46:15.614 --> 46:19.015
God's curse on you! The money is sacred!
It belongs to the temple!

46:19.117 --> 46:22.177
. The god of battle will destroy you!
. Blasphemy!

46:22.354 --> 46:24.345
You hypocrites. I'll kill you both.

46:25.123 --> 46:26.385
What are you doing?

46:26.491 --> 46:29.119
Here's all the treasure we wanted.
Come away!

46:40.906 --> 46:44.364
I'll kill you the way you had her killed.

47:00.659 --> 47:05.358
It seemed to me at the time, Barabbas,
when you were given your liberty before...

47:05.430 --> 47:07.830
...it wasn't a fortunate exchange.

47:08.066 --> 47:12.400
They were calling for death and disorder
when they called your name.

47:12.838 --> 47:16.330
This is what I thought
and this is what has occurred.

47:17.008 --> 47:19.374
They put the scourge back into the fist.

47:20.078 --> 47:22.046
By that I mean you and your life.

47:22.114 --> 47:24.708
And many men have suffered
and died in consequence.

47:24.783 --> 47:28.048
The other man, too.
They're dying because of that.

47:28.754 --> 47:32.019
This is a local matter,
which I hope will soon be adjusted.

47:33.358 --> 47:37.351
The shock and fear
of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.

47:38.263 --> 47:40.231
But the appetite to destroy...

47:40.465 --> 47:44.458
...which, alas, the human being shares
with the wild beast, is always with us.

47:44.569 --> 47:48.471
And it has rigorously to be disciplined
in the name of civilization...

47:48.573 --> 47:51.565
...and according to the law.
. That's what you say.

47:51.810 --> 47:55.576
But I tell you, whichever side of the law
we're on, we're the same men.

47:55.647 --> 47:58.081
You and your kind, and me and my kind.

47:58.150 --> 48:02.587
How else have you lived except my way?
What we haven't got, we go out and take.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.281
Let him speak.

48:12.464 --> 48:14.955
How else have you lived except my way?

48:15.834 --> 48:19.463
Whoever's against us or gets in our way,
we get rid of.

48:21.440 --> 48:25.342
My knife may have bitten a few throats,
but what about your weapons?

48:25.444 --> 48:28.242
They've split thousands upon thousands.

48:29.848 --> 48:32.942
If I've taken a passing woman to myself...

48:33.418 --> 48:36.649
...your armies have looted and raped
across continents.

48:37.255 --> 48:40.122
And have been called
the glory of the earth for doing it.

48:40.192 --> 48:44.492
You were born according to the law
and raised according to the law.

48:44.796 --> 48:47.492
I was born by a girl
thrown out of a brothel...

48:47.966 --> 48:50.628
...who gave birth and cursed me
before she died.

48:51.036 --> 48:54.005
But I tell you, we belong to the same herd.

48:54.172 --> 48:57.767
Unfortunately for you, Barabbas,
the law is indispensable.

48:57.843 --> 49:00.778
The law is the pass and permit
to life in this world.

49:01.313 --> 49:02.974
You were without it.

49:03.281 --> 49:06.512
However, the law here tells me...

49:07.018 --> 49:10.852
...that a man released
by the will of the people at a holy festival...

49:10.956 --> 49:13.516
...cannot thereafter
be given a capital punishment.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.735
You can't kill me?

49:31.042 --> 49:32.873
Easier on you if we could.

49:38.216 --> 49:41.811
I sentence you to transportation for life,
whatever that's worth...

49:41.887 --> 49:44.981
...to the sulfur mines
on the island of Sicily.

49:50.529 --> 49:51.860
I can't...

49:52.764 --> 49:54.095
...be killed.

49:57.269 --> 49:58.668
He meant me to live.

50:02.274 --> 50:04.105
Deliberately he did it.

50:04.409 --> 50:08.175
No killing Barabbas.
No death for Barabbas.

50:10.515 --> 50:12.346
He died in my place.

50:12.751 --> 50:14.776
The death has been paid.

50:18.757 --> 50:20.588
He's taken my death.

50:21.359 --> 50:24.692
That's it. He's taken my death.

50:25.363 --> 50:29.197
That light, that wasn't light.

50:29.868 --> 50:33.360
The dark, that wasn't dark.

50:33.605 --> 50:35.402
That wasn't dark, that was life.

50:35.473 --> 50:38.135
. That was life.
. Take the man away.

50:38.243 --> 50:41.212
You'll die and rot, but I'll live forever!

50:41.279 --> 50:45.215
I've got my life and you can't take it!

50:45.717 --> 50:48.117
You stinking fish!

50:48.219 --> 50:51.586
I've got my life and you can't have it!

50:51.890 --> 50:54.450
I've got my life!

51:11.276 --> 51:13.073
. Well, which are you?
. I'm Scorpus.

51:13.144 --> 51:15.510
That means nothing, idiot.
What's your number?

51:15.614 --> 51:18.412
.563.
. That's better.

51:23.655 --> 51:25.179
564.

51:27.993 --> 51:30.427
. Who's the god?
. The divine Emperor Tiberius.

51:30.495 --> 51:33.259
You have the privilege
of being his property.

51:36.034 --> 51:37.194
Move.

51:39.804 --> 51:41.328
565.

51:50.382 --> 51:51.849
Go on, move.

52:15.407 --> 52:19.207
That's all. Move on. Next two.

52:44.369 --> 52:45.859
Put your back to it.

53:00.452 --> 53:03.012
Move. Get your feet on the ground.

53:04.889 --> 53:06.516
What are they doing?

53:06.591 --> 53:09.890
They're sending us down to the next level
to make room for you.

53:10.061 --> 53:12.291
That's how you know
how long you've been here...

53:12.397 --> 53:14.126
...by how deep you're down.

53:14.299 --> 53:17.757
They break you in gradually
to get used to the dark.

55:44.749 --> 55:46.046
Wait.

55:54.692 --> 55:56.421
You've gotten used to the dark.

55:57.228 --> 55:58.718
Did it take long?

55:59.931 --> 56:01.296
Long enough.

56:02.267 --> 56:03.928
It's got into me.

56:07.605 --> 56:08.799
Come here.

56:16.481 --> 56:18.142
What do you see?

56:27.091 --> 56:28.456
You're blind.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.084
Sulfur burns.

56:59.090 --> 57:00.614
Dig.

57:06.597 --> 57:07.859
Here.

57:17.976 --> 57:21.468
You've got a partner there
that seems to know how to live forever.

57:22.013 --> 57:23.947
Better learn from him.

57:30.955 --> 57:32.650
How long has it been?

57:34.225 --> 57:35.954
Who was emperor then?

57:38.296 --> 57:40.821
Tiberius? That was long ago.

57:40.898 --> 57:42.957
Almost in another world.

57:44.702 --> 57:47.569
Here, I'm called Sahak.

57:51.542 --> 57:53.203
That's mine.

57:54.479 --> 57:55.673
Here.

57:57.682 --> 57:58.546
Move!

58:05.156 --> 58:07.386
You make this even a worse hell than it is.

58:10.228 --> 58:12.389
You don't care how I got here...

58:13.164 --> 58:14.756
...but I'll tell you.

58:15.933 --> 58:19.198
The ship I was serving on
took on a cargo of slaves.

58:19.604 --> 58:21.196
Some of them got free.

58:21.439 --> 58:24.374
Slipped over the side, during my watch.

58:26.778 --> 58:29.110
So, the captain put the chains on me.

58:32.950 --> 58:34.679
What about your world?

58:39.090 --> 58:40.682
What's your name?

58:43.194 --> 58:46.254
. I asked you what your name is.
. All right.

58:47.632 --> 58:49.566
If it's going to keep you quiet.

58:50.902 --> 58:52.233
Barabbas.

58:54.272 --> 58:56.103
What are you saying?

58:57.108 --> 58:59.235
Barabbas.

59:00.078 --> 59:02.069
What's the town you came from?

59:03.381 --> 59:04.746
Jerusalem.

59:05.883 --> 59:08.249
Are you the man they acquitted?

59:14.325 --> 59:15.883
What is that to you?

59:26.471 --> 59:29.770
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.

59:55.933 --> 59:59.835
That's what I like to see, devils and beasts
going for each other's throats.

01:00:00.204 --> 01:00:03.605
Here's a head of you to hate each other.
Now work, you crazy dogs.

01:00:04.175 --> 01:00:05.767
Let's see you working.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.676
Work!

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:32.786
Get out! Move!

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.773
You hate my name.

01:01:50.147 --> 01:01:52.240
You hate the sound of it.

01:01:53.451 --> 01:01:56.113
You weren't even in Jerusalem,
but you hate my name.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:58.154
That's right. We hate it.

01:01:58.322 --> 01:02:01.291
What does it matter?
What does it matter to you?

01:02:01.392 --> 01:02:03.986
. You know who was killed in your place?
. Still that?

01:02:04.095 --> 01:02:06.655
So, why shouldn't we hate your name?

01:02:07.732 --> 01:02:10.895
I thought what he said
was to love one another.

01:02:19.844 --> 01:02:21.744
I can't imagine...

01:02:24.415 --> 01:02:26.975
...he expects a man to have a spirit...

01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:29.783
...as strong and patient as a dray horse.

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.581
It was only something I was told.

01:02:37.295 --> 01:02:40.856
If you think I got the best of it,
you stay here for a generation or two.

01:02:40.965 --> 01:02:43.195
We've got a special duty for you two.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.327
This'll show you what happens
to fighting mongrels. Come on.

01:03:23.541 --> 01:03:25.702
Why isn't it all forgotten?

01:03:27.578 --> 01:03:29.978
That's what I don't understand.

01:03:31.716 --> 01:03:37.154
Who's been spreading things about?
Keeping that tale alive all these years?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:40.153
What could kill it?

01:03:42.393 --> 01:03:46.659
When you think it was God's will
come to Earth to show what he is.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.424
I can see the reality of that.

01:03:50.868 --> 01:03:54.235
Which is why the name of the Master
goes on growing in the world.

01:03:56.173 --> 01:04:00.269
I began to meet it wherever I sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.

01:04:00.911 --> 01:04:02.435
Even at the Port of Rome.

01:04:03.681 --> 01:04:06.548
I began to understand what it meant.

01:04:07.585 --> 01:04:08.779
But...

01:04:11.255 --> 01:04:14.122
...it's a tough demand, the will of God.

01:04:15.893 --> 01:04:21.058
I'm a poor hand at it.
And look where I've got us now.

01:04:21.699 --> 01:04:26.227
Even though I've got his sign scratched
on the back of the Emperor's head.

01:04:26.904 --> 01:04:29.896
It means I belong to him,
not to the Emperor.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:34.742
It's the sign he has put on us all,
if we give way enough to see it.

01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:36.970
Look at this.

01:04:38.649 --> 01:04:40.446
There's the shape of the cross.

01:04:41.585 --> 01:04:43.712
Keep your God to yourself.

01:04:43.921 --> 01:04:46.947
Why did you come here
and rake up old lies about killing God?

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:50.891
What's going on down there?
Move yourselves or I'll leave you to rot.

01:04:54.832 --> 01:04:56.163
Pull!

01:05:08.112 --> 01:05:10.012
You think what it's like to me.

01:05:12.616 --> 01:05:15.244
You're the only man I've met who saw him.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.653
You were there at the beginning,
and you won't talk.

01:05:18.756 --> 01:05:20.485
You won't tell me.

01:05:21.592 --> 01:05:25.289
. What are you afraid of?
. Nothing I'm afraid of.

01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.691
Then you can tell me.

01:05:28.165 --> 01:05:31.498
You see the darkness that went
over heaven and Earth when he died?

01:05:31.602 --> 01:05:33.126
Suppose I did.

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:37.466
The man died in a dust storm,
the same as anybody's death.

01:05:38.676 --> 01:05:40.837
Suppose his tomb was empty.

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:44.944
Can't a dead man be taken away?
You want the truth? I'll give it to you.

01:05:45.182 --> 01:05:47.548
That's all of your God you'll get out of me.

01:05:55.626 --> 01:05:56.991
Here, what's the matter?

01:05:57.628 --> 01:05:58.686
Come on, get up.

01:05:59.396 --> 01:06:02.559
If they see you can't work
they take you and you won't come back.

01:06:08.138 --> 01:06:09.867
Hey! Away!

01:06:18.315 --> 01:06:19.680
All right, wake up.

01:06:19.984 --> 01:06:24.512
. Come on. Move out, all of you.
. Get on your feet. You've had your sleep.

01:06:24.588 --> 01:06:28.581
. You two, get your feet on the ground.
. Get out of there. Come on. Move!

01:06:28.893 --> 01:06:31.555
Root yourselves out! Move, I say!

01:06:34.198 --> 01:06:35.495
Wake up.

01:06:38.202 --> 01:06:40.170
All right, there's work to be done.

01:06:40.938 --> 01:06:42.929
. You've had enough sleep now.
. Wake up.

01:06:44.108 --> 01:06:47.373
Come on, you! You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?

01:06:47.845 --> 01:06:50.405
. Get on your feet, I say.
. One dead man here.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:55.542
I said get on your feet, all of you.
Now come on. Up on your feet.

01:06:56.921 --> 01:07:01.221
. You've got to look as if you can work.
. What's the matter with you?

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.123
You can't stand up? Can't work?

01:07:08.732 --> 01:07:10.131
I can work.

01:07:15.639 --> 01:07:17.698
Here, this one's no use.

01:11:24.555 --> 01:11:27.547
. How many survivors?
. None, sir. There can't be any.

01:11:27.624 --> 01:11:31.617
. It was like the end of the world to them.
. The end of the underworld.

01:11:31.728 --> 01:11:33.992
. What did you say, sir?
. Nothing.

01:11:34.064 --> 01:11:35.088
Survivors!

01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:36.860
Over here. Survivors.

01:11:37.201 --> 01:11:39.169
Get ready to receive survivors!

01:11:51.748 --> 01:11:52.908
Away.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.210
Pull!

01:13:50.367 --> 01:13:52.995
When they've recovered,
put them to work in the fields.

01:15:06.777 --> 01:15:09.177
I can taste the salt in the air.

01:15:09.579 --> 01:15:12.446
Every breath of wind is full of the sea.

01:15:14.818 --> 01:15:18.777
I thought I could never love it
better than I did. But, oh, glory!

01:15:18.955 --> 01:15:21.185
After the darkness of the mines...

01:15:22.592 --> 01:15:25.527
...I could go and drown in it
like a man besotted.

01:15:26.863 --> 01:15:28.990
Now, are you glad to live?

01:15:30.133 --> 01:15:32.124
What? Like a damned ox?

01:15:32.636 --> 01:15:35.799
Salt me down
and I'd praise God even for this.

01:15:35.972 --> 01:15:39.339
How many times were you swindled
in those foreign ports?

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:43.304
You must've been the easiest game
they ever got their hands on.

01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.645
. Why is that?
. You'd fall for any trick.

01:15:48.552 --> 01:15:49.712
One smile...

01:15:50.854 --> 01:15:53.823
...and you trust the world
that half kills you.

01:15:53.890 --> 01:15:55.118
Yes, I trust it.

01:15:56.126 --> 01:15:57.650
It has to be hard going...

01:15:57.727 --> 01:16:00.719
...or else how will the strength come
that God has wanted?

01:16:00.997 --> 01:16:03.397
God should make himself plain
or leave me alone.

01:16:04.201 --> 01:16:07.568
Am I the one who lets himself be swindled,
or you?

01:16:07.804 --> 01:16:11.137
Every time he came near,
you refused to believe it.

01:16:11.408 --> 01:16:13.376
But it's never been out of your mind.

01:16:14.177 --> 01:16:16.975
What other man's death
could have troubled you so long?

01:16:32.229 --> 01:16:34.891
Stop there. Pull over to the side.

01:16:40.203 --> 01:16:42.000
Rock to be carried.

01:17:19.276 --> 01:17:20.208
Here.

01:17:47.404 --> 01:17:50.305
It's a poor scratching, but the true sign.

01:17:51.942 --> 01:17:54.308
Now will you leave me in peace?

01:18:02.285 --> 01:18:04.116
All right, we go on.

01:18:20.604 --> 01:18:21.798
Wait.

01:18:22.472 --> 01:18:26.306
Julia, there are the two men
I was telling you about.

01:18:26.476 --> 01:18:28.774
Send for them, Rufio. I want to see them.

01:18:28.845 --> 01:18:31.643
. Bring those men over here to us.
. Very good, sir.

01:18:34.818 --> 01:18:38.345
Stop! These two.
Take them off the plough.

01:18:39.389 --> 01:18:42.153
Two men so strangely come up
from the underworld.

01:18:42.225 --> 01:18:45.558
Twenty years in the mines, the old one.
Indestructible.

01:18:45.662 --> 01:18:47.061
I heard so.

01:18:55.572 --> 01:18:58.871
You've earned the air you breathe,
you two, by sheer good fortune.

01:18:59.309 --> 01:19:02.176
. What are your names?
. Sahak, sir.

01:19:02.512 --> 01:19:04.878
. And yours?
. Barabbas.

01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:07.576
What's your age?

01:19:08.885 --> 01:19:10.147
What does it matter?

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:13.678
Indeed, what should it matter?
We understand you mean to live forever.

01:19:13.757 --> 01:19:16.351
I must touch them
for the luck that's in them.

01:19:16.426 --> 01:19:18.553
My wife thinks your merit is contagious.

01:19:19.062 --> 01:19:21.656
All right,
we don't want to hold up the work.

01:19:21.731 --> 01:19:23.062
Back now.

01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.120
It's from the Emperor.

01:19:48.858 --> 01:19:51.088
It seems the gods approve
your superstition.

01:19:51.194 --> 01:19:52.525
We're to call to Rome.

01:19:53.029 --> 01:19:56.396
. To Rome? What does it mean?
. I'm to enter the Senate.

01:19:56.466 --> 01:20:00.232
. We're to rise in the world.
. Rufio. Rome!

01:20:01.304 --> 01:20:03.397
It's true. They are charmed.

01:20:03.473 --> 01:20:06.704
We must always take them with us.
A good thing I touched them.

01:20:06.776 --> 01:20:08.573
I see, their success, not mine.

01:20:08.645 --> 01:20:13.378
Nothing but amiable days from now on,
and knowing everybody instead of nobody.

01:20:13.583 --> 01:20:16.575
. When shall we go?
. Ride with us. I'll give you the answer.

01:20:16.653 --> 01:20:20.054
How wretched to arrive
when all have gone to the mountains...

01:21:00.096 --> 01:21:01.256
Look over there.

01:24:10.787 --> 01:24:13.847
Well, here we have to leave your luck
to learn its business.

01:24:13.957 --> 01:24:16.482
What do you mean?
Why do we come here?

01:24:16.559 --> 01:24:19.892
They cannot fight yet.
They must first learn the skill.

01:24:19.996 --> 01:24:21.293
And so they will.

01:24:21.364 --> 01:24:25.232
But here we have to deliver them over.
Let's hope they won't disgrace us.

01:24:25.335 --> 01:24:29.635
When a charmed life turns professional,
we can expect great things.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.803
Flacus, the Commander.
You honor Rome and us.

01:24:34.477 --> 01:24:37.173
Our happiness is all here, Commander.

01:26:17.013 --> 01:26:20.608
Unsurpassable. The Emperor
has given him his freedom three times.

01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:24.809
There's the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Always he prefers to come back.

01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:27.355
He knows his empire
and has the sense to keep it.

01:26:27.457 --> 01:26:31.621
Keep it he does.
He's taken a fair toll of them.

01:26:32.528 --> 01:26:35.292
Torvald, the Senator Rufio and his lady.

01:26:36.499 --> 01:26:38.330
I'll take this life.

01:26:39.769 --> 01:26:42.863
Can't a man be made mad
by the smell of blood?

01:26:44.674 --> 01:26:46.801
A man can understand this.

01:27:04.026 --> 01:27:06.893
To throw the net, hold it to your right,
like this.

01:27:08.131 --> 01:27:10.725
Then throw from the tips of your fingers,
like this.

01:27:14.737 --> 01:27:16.398
Your places now.

01:27:16.873 --> 01:27:19.000
One here, you here and you over there.

01:27:19.675 --> 01:27:22.371
Now, start your practice. Throw your nets.

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:25.211
What's this?

01:27:25.314 --> 01:27:28.977
Have they mistaken this place
for an old men's hospital?

01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:31.350
The gray. Haired one?

01:27:31.721 --> 01:27:35.384
They say there's something remarkable
about him. Nothing can kill him.

01:28:13.696 --> 01:28:16.290
Show me what you can do, grandfather.

01:29:21.163 --> 01:29:23.597
What do we do with aging fish,
grandfather?

01:29:24.533 --> 01:29:26.524
It's time he was thrown to the gulls.

01:29:29.772 --> 01:29:31.137
Let me be.

01:29:33.976 --> 01:29:35.307
Hit! One!

01:29:36.012 --> 01:29:37.843
Hit! Two!

01:29:52.628 --> 01:29:54.061
You move on.

01:32:31.954 --> 01:32:34.445
Bring out the first group of gladiators.

01:32:55.845 --> 01:32:56.903
You remember me?

01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:00.176
You drew the sign of the Master
beside my plate.

01:33:00.249 --> 01:33:02.183
How did you know I carried the sign?

01:33:02.251 --> 01:33:05.152
Several days I've watched you
breaking the bread.

01:33:06.021 --> 01:33:07.318
Can we speak freely?

01:33:07.389 --> 01:33:10.085
He was there in Jerusalem.
He knew the Master.

01:33:12.595 --> 01:33:14.756
God be praised and keep you safe.

01:33:17.733 --> 01:33:21.669
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.

01:33:21.737 --> 01:33:24.103
The Emperor wants to destroy
every trace of us.

01:33:30.212 --> 01:33:33.272
But tomorrow, when the games are over
and the sun is down...

01:33:33.382 --> 01:33:35.043
...discipline will be lax...

01:33:35.384 --> 01:33:39.252
...and there may be a chance for me
to lead you to where we meet.

01:33:39.355 --> 01:33:42.017
The Master's disciple, Peter,
is here in Rome.

01:33:42.791 --> 01:33:46.420
Seldom enough I find my way there,
some way off to the catacombs.

01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:50.028
The catacombs?
Surely it's the dead who meet there.

01:33:50.099 --> 01:33:52.363
It may seem to you that the faith is buried.

01:33:52.434 --> 01:33:54.925
But so is the seed
before there can be a harvest.

01:33:55.037 --> 01:33:56.766
First group, assemble.

01:33:56.972 --> 01:33:59.440
You shall see tomorrow
the life we keep there.

01:33:59.542 --> 01:34:01.305
First group, assemble.

01:34:01.577 --> 01:34:03.909
. Did you hear him, Barabbas?
. I heard.

01:34:12.421 --> 01:34:16.824
One, two, one, two...

01:34:38.781 --> 01:34:40.612
To your fighting places.

01:34:42.918 --> 01:34:43.748
Go.

01:34:56.699 --> 01:34:59.167
When you've taken up these positions
tomorrow...

01:34:59.268 --> 01:35:01.031
...the trumpets will sound.

01:35:01.136 --> 01:35:02.694
And from above you, there...

01:35:03.105 --> 01:35:05.539
...the white cloth will be thrown
into the arena.

01:35:05.975 --> 01:35:09.376
When it touches the ground,
the contest will begin.

01:35:10.512 --> 01:35:13.970
To make sure you understand,
this is the way it will happen.

01:35:53.222 --> 01:35:55.713
Kill him! Kill him!

01:38:12.528 --> 01:38:14.621
. That's an angry crowd.
. They want blood.

01:38:14.696 --> 01:38:17.824
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak,
who wouldn't kill his man.

01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:20.733
If the Emperor were here,
he wouldn't have had a choice.

01:38:20.836 --> 01:38:21.996
Wait till tomorrow.

01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:25.039
He'll get his quota of killing,
if you're lucky to win.

01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.404
. Not one life will he get from me.
. Won't he?

01:38:27.509 --> 01:38:30.410
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.

01:38:30.512 --> 01:38:33.413
. When he says death, death it is.
. The true God says life.

01:38:33.515 --> 01:38:35.983
. I only answer to him.
. Hark at this man.

01:38:37.319 --> 01:38:39.583
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor...

01:38:39.688 --> 01:38:42.987
. Who do you call your God?
. The only one.

01:38:43.592 --> 01:38:47.358
The rest are inventions of fear,
tales taken from the past...

01:38:47.596 --> 01:38:50.759
...they can no more help you
than this breast can bleed.

01:38:50.866 --> 01:38:51.855
Put 'em down.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:55.492
. Insulting the gods before we go fight.
. What revenge will Mars take?

01:38:55.571 --> 01:38:57.766
None at all. He doesn't exist.

01:38:57.873 --> 01:39:01.070
Mars doesn't exist?
What do you mean, he doesn't exist?

01:39:01.844 --> 01:39:03.505
Will you keep your mouth shut?

01:39:03.679 --> 01:39:07.171
The real God is greater
than any man's thoughts can imagine.

01:39:08.617 --> 01:39:11.586
He made life as deep and strong
as the sea.

01:39:12.221 --> 01:39:15.122
Your gods are as shallow
as a reeking pond.

01:39:15.224 --> 01:39:20.059
He's above us and around us, in us.
Like the breath in our bodies.

01:39:20.562 --> 01:39:23.463
And he has one law
that will break our pattern.

01:39:23.699 --> 01:39:25.360
The law is love.

01:39:26.268 --> 01:39:29.101
Whatever we do
that breaks that law condemns us.

01:39:30.606 --> 01:39:33.268
And so that we should see
what his love is...

01:39:33.375 --> 01:39:36.970
...he sent his son to live the life of a man.

01:39:37.913 --> 01:39:40.814
To show that God understands
the life he has made.

01:39:41.483 --> 01:39:43.815
. Who spun you this?
. What do you want us to do?

01:39:43.919 --> 01:39:45.648
What good will he do us in the arena?

01:39:45.754 --> 01:39:48.154
We'll lose the goodwill
of the gods we know.

01:39:48.257 --> 01:39:52.159
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor
that we know what life's worth.

01:39:53.061 --> 01:39:54.756
Throw away your weapons.

01:39:55.264 --> 01:39:58.722
Do you think all the things
of the Earth and the heavens...

01:39:59.001 --> 01:40:03.165
...have been made for no other reason
except we should eat and make money...

01:40:03.272 --> 01:40:05.672
...and spawn children and kill and die?

01:40:09.311 --> 01:40:11.245
What a purpose for creation!

01:40:15.183 --> 01:40:17.515
If anything's beyond belief, that is.

01:40:19.955 --> 01:40:22.685
God said, "Burn away the old world...

01:40:23.825 --> 01:40:26.487
"...and let a new one rise from the ashes."

01:40:26.662 --> 01:40:30.154
As the Son of God rose from the dead,
he died for us.

01:40:31.466 --> 01:40:34.026
Ask Barabbas here the truth
of what I tell you.

01:40:34.136 --> 01:40:37.503
He saw with his own eyes the Son of God
when he lived among us.

01:40:37.606 --> 01:40:38.800
Saw him die.

01:40:38.874 --> 01:40:41.274
Was there, in the garden,
on the third morning.

01:40:41.343 --> 01:40:42.640
You saw him, Barabbas?

01:40:42.711 --> 01:40:45.145
. Tell us what you saw.
. What happened?

01:40:45.213 --> 01:40:48.444
A long time ago I saw a man.

01:40:48.884 --> 01:40:50.442
Some people say he was...

01:40:50.519 --> 01:40:52.214
...the Son of God.
. Enough!

01:40:52.321 --> 01:40:54.118
You've condemned yourselves.

01:40:54.189 --> 01:40:56.783
I charge you with sedition
and stirring up mutiny.

01:40:56.858 --> 01:40:58.553
You're both under arrest.

01:40:58.660 --> 01:41:01.823
Take them out and put them in chains.
Move now!

01:41:06.969 --> 01:41:10.996
Let me be sure you understand
the seriousness of the charge against you.

01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.334
Not only with holding views proscribed
by the State...

01:41:16.178 --> 01:41:20.239
...for which the punishment is death,
but of recommending those views...

01:41:20.382 --> 01:41:22.816
...to men sworn to the State's service.

01:41:24.186 --> 01:41:27.747
What is more,
you've betrayed your faith to me...

01:41:29.257 --> 01:41:31.248
...who brought you to this city...

01:41:31.827 --> 01:41:35.820
...and laid me under possible suspicion
of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.

01:41:36.198 --> 01:41:38.359
The prospect is black for you.

01:41:39.368 --> 01:41:40.995
You know what this is?

01:41:41.903 --> 01:41:46.237
. The stamp of the Roman State.
. Which means that you're Rome's property.

01:41:50.112 --> 01:41:51.704
What's this cut here?

01:41:53.715 --> 01:41:55.342
The sign of my master.

01:41:56.852 --> 01:42:00.618
. Who do you call your master?
. The one who is my lord.

01:42:01.289 --> 01:42:04.747
. The Son of the Father.
. In other words, the Christian sign?

01:42:05.694 --> 01:42:09.255
A religion which sets itself up
to menace government and order.

01:42:09.931 --> 01:42:12.798
Which denies the divine authority
of the Emperor.

01:42:13.735 --> 01:42:17.068
Which preaches that the slave is equal
to the free man...

01:42:18.106 --> 01:42:22.702
...and would reduce society to anarchy.
A rebellious, insufferable doctrine.

01:42:24.913 --> 01:42:28.644
Give me a direct answer.
Do you belong to the State?

01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:31.919
I belong to the Lord, my god.

01:42:40.395 --> 01:42:42.454
So, you also believe in this god?

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:46.265
Tell me, do you?

01:42:48.103 --> 01:42:49.229
You don't?

01:42:50.138 --> 01:42:52.732
Then why do you bear his name
on your disc?

01:42:54.342 --> 01:42:55.809
Isn't he your god?

01:42:56.678 --> 01:42:59.078
Isn't that what the inscription means?

01:43:01.316 --> 01:43:02.578
I have no god.

01:43:04.786 --> 01:43:06.276
I don't understand.

01:43:07.656 --> 01:43:11.649
Why then do you bear this sign
of Jesus Christ, scratched on your disc?

01:43:14.529 --> 01:43:15.757
Because I...

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.929
...tried to believe.

01:43:25.207 --> 01:43:28.301
I'll give you the opportunity
to recover your senses.

01:43:29.711 --> 01:43:32.703
If you'll admit publicly
to the men you spoke to...

01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:36.678
...that all these things were lies,
you may save your life.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:40.153
Will you do this?

01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:45.018
That would be to lose my life, not save it.

01:43:46.328 --> 01:43:48.023
What I am is his.

01:43:49.531 --> 01:43:51.362
But isn't life dear to you?

01:43:52.067 --> 01:43:53.227
Yes, it is.

01:43:54.336 --> 01:43:58.204
And you understand the cruel death
that punishes mutiny and sedition?

01:44:00.809 --> 01:44:02.299
What do you choose?

01:44:04.579 --> 01:44:05.978
I choose my god.

01:44:10.018 --> 01:44:12.043
Then there is no more I can do for you.

01:44:12.988 --> 01:44:14.546
Guilty of the charge.

01:44:15.056 --> 01:44:16.921
Execution at sunrise.

01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.425
You're as mad as your god.

01:44:22.998 --> 01:44:25.330
You, come here.

01:44:48.723 --> 01:44:52.921
Unwise to carry around with you
what you don't believe in.

01:45:00.735 --> 01:45:04.227
It may be the Master means you to live.

01:45:06.274 --> 01:45:08.606
He may have some greater need of you.

01:45:10.078 --> 01:45:12.069
Some other purpose, Barabbas.

01:45:13.248 --> 01:45:15.648
. Something else.
. Take him away.

01:45:15.750 --> 01:45:16.978
Guards.

01:45:18.453 --> 01:45:21.581
Now you'll have to be worth two men
to take his place.

01:45:21.656 --> 01:45:23.089
You may go.

01:46:28.990 --> 01:46:32.323
You are to witness the punishment
of this man...

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:35.222
...so that there can be no doubt
in your mind...

01:46:35.330 --> 01:46:39.733
...that the words he spoke to you
were a gross breach of the law.

01:46:39.834 --> 01:46:42.302
An iniquitous crime against the State.

01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:45.130
Not only lies, but treasonable lies...

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:48.871
...which were not only aimed
at spreading rebellion among you...

01:46:48.977 --> 01:46:51.002
...but also to pervert your minds...

01:46:51.646 --> 01:46:55.377
...from those acceptable religions
on which the State is built.

01:46:55.817 --> 01:46:58.809
Any man who thinks
that those words are harmless...

01:46:59.587 --> 01:47:04.183
...or thinks that he can repeat or conform
to such words as this man spoke...

01:47:04.859 --> 01:47:09.091
...let him take warning from
the punishment you are about to witness.

01:47:09.564 --> 01:47:11.361
Long live the Emperor!

01:47:13.435 --> 01:47:14.834
Proceed, Torvald.

01:47:18.206 --> 01:47:19.571
Positions.

01:47:24.346 --> 01:47:25.404
Ready.

01:47:28.783 --> 01:47:29.841
Throw.

01:47:32.954 --> 01:47:34.353
Traitors and fools!

01:48:00.148 --> 01:48:02.309
You'll wish this was better done.

01:58:29.443 --> 01:58:31.240
Kill him! Kill him!

01:59:37.011 --> 01:59:41.448
Gladiator Barabbas, you're becoming
quite a legend among us, I hear.

01:59:42.349 --> 01:59:44.579
For your remarkable persistence in life...

01:59:44.919 --> 01:59:47.615
...we have a traditional answer
to this public acclaim.

01:59:50.958 --> 01:59:53.791
We make you a free man.
We give you your liberty.

01:59:54.595 --> 01:59:56.586
Here is the symbol of your freedom.

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.358
I brought him to you.

02:03:22.069 --> 02:03:24.503
This is where he would have wanted
to be buried.

02:03:25.339 --> 02:03:26.897
Our brother Sahak.

02:03:58.706 --> 02:04:01.106
So you had to carry
your dead conscience here.

02:04:01.208 --> 02:04:03.438
Did he have to die
before you cared about him?

02:04:03.544 --> 02:04:06.104
Are you more concerned with his body
than his life?

02:04:06.213 --> 02:04:08.545
You were willing to let him
go to his death alone.

02:04:08.615 --> 02:04:10.879
Why should you help him
now he doesn't need you?

02:04:10.951 --> 02:04:13.442
How could I have helped him
by being killed?

02:04:13.554 --> 02:04:16.216
He made his own death.
What good has it done?

02:04:17.224 --> 02:04:19.249
I had to go on living, he said.

02:04:20.094 --> 02:04:25.555
. There was something I still had to do.
. Barabbas, why should you believe it?

02:04:26.367 --> 02:04:29.029
When the light shone,
you wouldn't accept it.

02:04:29.636 --> 02:04:31.866
When the dark came, you denied it.

02:04:32.706 --> 02:04:35.937
When the spirit of God beckoned,
you refused it.

02:04:36.877 --> 02:04:39.937
When Sahak says
your life is kept for some purpose...

02:04:40.581 --> 02:04:42.139
...why should you believe it?

02:04:42.249 --> 02:04:44.945
To make a gag for your conscience,
is that it?

02:04:46.286 --> 02:04:48.754
You believe it because it suits you.

02:04:49.456 --> 02:04:53.051
Or maybe if Sahak stood before you now
then you would say you believed.

02:04:53.127 --> 02:04:54.788
You would repent and love God.

02:04:56.096 --> 02:04:57.495
It would be easy.

02:04:58.465 --> 02:05:01.161
But what strength
would your belief have then?

02:05:03.404 --> 02:05:04.962
What would it matter?

02:05:06.473 --> 02:05:09.101
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.

02:05:12.079 --> 02:05:14.980
There must have been a reason. Why me?

02:05:15.349 --> 02:05:16.907
Why did he choose me?

02:05:23.957 --> 02:05:25.754
Where have you gone?

02:05:26.994 --> 02:05:28.120
You!

02:05:29.196 --> 02:05:30.458
Where are you?

02:05:32.866 --> 02:05:34.094
Wait for me.

02:05:34.468 --> 02:05:35.696
Wait!

02:05:36.336 --> 02:05:37.530
You wait!

02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:01.651
For God's sake, where are you?

02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:05.521
Show me the way! I'm lost!

02:06:12.506 --> 02:06:14.303
Which way shall I go?

02:07:24.811 --> 02:07:26.642
. What's happening?
. Rome is burning.

02:07:26.747 --> 02:07:28.908
Can't you see? Rome is burning.

02:08:12.292 --> 02:08:15.921
. What happened to make the fire?
. The Christians tried to burn down Rome.

02:08:15.996 --> 02:08:18.521
. Move! Move that case. Come on.
. Christians?

02:08:29.176 --> 02:08:32.202
. The Christians are burning Rome!
. It's the Christians!

02:08:32.346 --> 02:08:33.370
Fire!

02:08:48.829 --> 02:08:51.024
They're burning away the old world.

02:08:54.635 --> 02:08:56.398
The new kingdom is coming.

02:09:00.007 --> 02:09:00.871
God.

02:09:02.542 --> 02:09:04.806
You won't find me failing this time.

02:10:32.399 --> 02:10:34.890
What are you doing, madman?

02:10:34.968 --> 02:10:38.995
Fire of God destroying the old world.
The hour has come when all is to perish.

02:10:39.106 --> 02:10:41.438
. Are you a Christian?
. Yes, I am.

02:10:41.842 --> 02:10:44.072
And I'm ready for Him!

02:10:44.945 --> 02:10:48.938
The whole world will soon be ablaze.
Do you hear that?

02:10:49.816 --> 02:10:51.477
We're burning the way.

02:10:52.252 --> 02:10:54.413
We're ready for his coming.

02:10:57.457 --> 02:10:59.823
. Take him away.
. The Master!

02:11:00.761 --> 02:11:03.662
. The Master's coming to build a new world.
. Away!

02:11:03.764 --> 02:11:06.756
Let me go!
I must make ready for his coming!

02:11:08.001 --> 02:11:10.765
Let me go!

02:11:17.010 --> 02:11:19.706
Here! Get yourself out of this one.

02:11:19.880 --> 02:11:24.374
Here's one of your kind who was caught
in the act, setting light to a storehouse.

02:11:28.021 --> 02:11:31.855
He admits he's a Christian,
burning the city to start a new kingdom.

02:11:32.993 --> 02:11:34.984
The only honest man among you.

02:11:39.966 --> 02:11:42.662
Who are you?
We've never seen you before.

02:11:42.736 --> 02:11:45.227
Is it true?
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?

02:11:45.338 --> 02:11:46.202
Yes.

02:11:46.306 --> 02:11:48.900
. We've never seen you before.
. Who are you?

02:11:50.477 --> 02:11:52.308
My name is Barabbas.

02:11:53.914 --> 02:11:57.350
. Barabbas, the robber.
. Barabbas, the acquitted.

02:11:57.651 --> 02:12:00.176
This burning city is no work of ours.

02:12:01.021 --> 02:12:04.013
This isn't how the new kingdom
is going to be made.

02:12:04.191 --> 02:12:05.249
You were wrong.

02:12:06.827 --> 02:12:08.988
Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?

02:12:10.363 --> 02:12:12.991
Many years ago we spoke together.

02:12:13.567 --> 02:12:15.057
You remember?

02:12:15.535 --> 02:12:16.399
No.

02:12:17.170 --> 02:12:20.105
You asked me why I was making a net
so far from the sea.

02:12:24.578 --> 02:12:25.704
Jerusalem.

02:12:28.348 --> 02:12:30.111
The street of the potters.

02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:33.376
You were mistaken of us then
as you are again now.

02:12:37.624 --> 02:12:39.285
We didn't set fire to the city.

02:12:39.392 --> 02:12:41.860
You've done the work of the wild beast,
the Emperor.

02:12:41.928 --> 02:12:45.056
. Are you a lunatic?
. It was his fire, you fool, not God's.

02:12:45.131 --> 02:12:47.292
Why can't God make himself plain?

02:12:50.070 --> 02:12:52.300
What's become of all the fine hopes?

02:12:52.606 --> 02:12:54.699
The trumpets, the angels?

02:12:56.109 --> 02:12:57.804
All the promises?

02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.146
Every time I've seen it end up the same
way, with torments and dead bodies...

02:13:04.251 --> 02:13:06.082
...with no good come of it.

02:13:16.062 --> 02:13:17.393
All for nothing.

02:13:17.964 --> 02:13:21.297
Do you think they persecute us
to destroy nothing?

02:13:22.435 --> 02:13:25.495
Or do you think that
what has battered on your soul...

02:13:25.605 --> 02:13:27.937
...for twenty years has been nothing?

02:13:28.308 --> 02:13:32.745
It wasn't for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn't nothing.

02:13:33.914 --> 02:13:36.940
In his eyes,
each individual man is the whole world.

02:13:37.584 --> 02:13:40.417
He loves each man
as though there were no other.

02:13:40.687 --> 02:13:43.781
I was the opposite of everything he taught,
wasn't I?

02:13:45.492 --> 02:13:47.824
Why did he let himself be killed
instead of me?

02:13:47.928 --> 02:13:51.159
Because being farthest from him,
you were the nearest.

02:13:52.499 --> 02:13:56.299
. I'm no nearer than I was before.
. Nor any farther away.

02:13:57.270 --> 02:14:00.762
The truth of the matter is,
he's never moved from your side.

02:14:04.978 --> 02:14:06.502
I can tell you this.

02:14:07.347 --> 02:14:11.215
There has been a wrestling in your spirit,
back and forth in your life...

02:14:11.451 --> 02:14:16.718
...which in itself is knowledge of God.
By the conflict you have known him.

02:14:17.557 --> 02:14:21.721
I can tell you as well, that so it will be
with the coming of the kingdom.

02:14:21.995 --> 02:14:26.125
That wrestling back and forth
and the laboring of the world spirit...

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:28.734
...like a woman in childbirth.

02:14:31.171 --> 02:14:32.968
We are only the beginning.

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:37.173
We won't see the time
when the Earth is full of the kingdom.

02:14:37.243 --> 02:14:40.144
And yet, even now, even here...

02:14:41.014 --> 02:14:43.073
...we are at the end ourselves.

02:14:44.584 --> 02:14:46.347
The kingdom is within us.

02:14:47.687 --> 02:14:49.678
There is nothing more to fear.

02:14:50.523 --> 02:14:55.358
Upon us, the years will be built.
Many years, many martyrdoms.

02:14:56.563 --> 02:14:59.555
The ground of men is very stubborn
to mature.

02:15:00.567 --> 02:15:06.699
But men will look back to us in our day
and will wonder and remember our hope.

02:15:09.509 --> 02:15:11.568
<i>It is the end of the day.</i>

02:15:13.346 --> 02:15:15.940
<i>We shall trust ourselves to a little pain...</i>

02:15:17.250 --> 02:15:18.512
<i>... and sleep.</i>

02:15:19.719 --> 02:15:21.346
<i>Saying to the world:</i>

02:15:22.288 --> 02:15:23.846
<i>"God's speed."</i>

02:15:42.275 --> 02:15:43.936
What hour is it?

02:15:46.413 --> 02:15:47.903
Night or day?

02:15:58.324 --> 02:16:00.053
The sixth hour goes...

02:16:02.395 --> 02:16:04.226
...when darkness...

02:16:24.617 --> 02:16:26.107
Darkness...

02:16:31.157 --> 02:16:32.954
I give myself up...

02:16:34.627 --> 02:16:36.356
...into your keeping.

02:16:53.146 --> 02:16:54.636
It is...

02:16:55.647 --> 02:16:56.842
...Barabbas.
