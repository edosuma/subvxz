00:17.936 --> 00:19.854
Oh, fuck.

00:19.938 --> 00:22.314
What time is it?
Cameraman:
9:30.

00:22.398 --> 00:24.901
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

00:24.984 --> 00:26.694
All right, I'll
be out in a minute.

00:26.778 --> 00:28.112
So what's up, Bubbles?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.989
Do you want to
tell me what's wrong?

00:30.072 --> 00:31.532
Well, it's just...

00:31.616 --> 00:33.409
you know, I've got
some things going on

00:33.492 --> 00:35.369
and you're always
such a good listener.

00:35.453 --> 00:38.581
I thought maybe
we could talk.

00:38.664 --> 00:39.874
Yeah, well, thank you.

00:39.958 --> 00:41.208
You know you
can talk to me

00:41.292 --> 00:43.043
any time about anything.
(Cat meowing)

00:43.127 --> 00:46.046
Well, it's just that...

00:46.130 --> 00:47.381
I think I might be coming

00:47.465 --> 00:50.217
a little bit attached
to Coolnow.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.553
I don't know exactly
how to deal with it.

00:52.637 --> 00:54.555
(Laugh)
What's wrong with that?

00:54.639 --> 00:57.224
Well, I just...
you know, I...

00:57.308 --> 00:59.435
feel like I'm kind
of cheating on
my kitties, you know.

00:59.518 --> 01:02.563
They're... always been
my main thing and...

01:02.647 --> 01:04.230
Hey, you know what?

01:04.315 --> 01:05.566
You're right,

01:05.650 --> 01:08.068
You probably should
cool it with Coolnow.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.278
Oh, fuck!
I knew it.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.738
Yeah. Like,
look at this guy.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.197
He's really neglected.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.492
He's so jealous.
Look.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.076
Oh my God,
I knew it!

01:16.160 --> 01:19.246
He hates Coolnow,
I think...

01:19.330 --> 01:20.957
Bubbles...
Sorry , Coolnow.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.249
I'm just kidding!

01:22.333 --> 01:24.418
Of course it's okay
to love Coolnow.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.545
It doesn't mean you love
your kitties any less.

01:26.629 --> 01:29.256
You think so?
Yeah, it's totally fine.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.926
You guys can all live
in the shed together
like a big happy family.

01:32.010 --> 01:34.345
Hey, what do you
think of that?
(Footsteps approaching)

01:34.428 --> 01:36.848
(Giggling)
Who's a good Papa's dog?

01:36.931 --> 01:40.018
Bubs, why the fuck
didn't you wake me up?
We're late! Let's go!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.645
Well, Ricky's still here.
I didn't think there
was a big fucking rush.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.563
Ricky's still here?!

01:44.647 --> 01:46.440
Ricky, what the
fuck are you doing?

01:46.524 --> 01:47.942
You were supposed to
be down at the rink

01:48.026 --> 01:49.944
a half hour ago
letting in the kids.

01:50.028 --> 01:51.779
The plants need food, man!

01:51.863 --> 01:54.281
Ricky, why do you
got frozen hot dogs
on your unit?

01:54.365 --> 01:55.658
I can't move, boys.

01:55.741 --> 01:56.909
Fucking something
going on with my nuts.

01:56.993 --> 01:58.786
They're fucking
killing me.

01:58.870 --> 02:01.163
You jacked off too
soon, didn't you?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.623
Didn't ya?

02:02.707 --> 02:04.792
Oh, he cranked it.
You know he cranked it.

02:04.876 --> 02:06.585
How long did you
fucking wait, Ricky?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.130
Almost two days.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.174
Two days!
Two fucking days!

02:12.257 --> 02:13.968
Sam said two weeks!
What are you thinking?

02:14.052 --> 02:15.636
I couldn't fucking
take it. I was horny.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.137
It was fucking up my brain!
Now look at me.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.639
Fucking all black
and swollen up

02:18.723 --> 02:20.432
like a couple of
canned antelopes!

02:20.516 --> 02:22.393
Oh, my Jesus!
'cause they're infected, Ricky!

02:22.476 --> 02:24.979
Look at them!
Is that bad?

02:25.063 --> 02:27.732
Is it bad for your
balls to be infected?
Yeah.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.567
We've got to get him
to the hospital. Let's go...

02:29.650 --> 02:31.485
No, no, no.
First we gotta get
down to the rink

02:31.569 --> 02:33.320
before the parents
start freaking out.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.031
It's all good,
Julian. Dad's down
there dealing with it.

02:37.075 --> 02:38.659
What the fuck are
you talking about?

02:38.743 --> 02:40.578
Lahey?
Yeah, my dad.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.038
Oh, Lord baby Jesus.

02:42.121 --> 02:44.040
You're calling
him Dad now?

02:44.123 --> 02:46.458
That's what you call
someone that makes you
with their cock, Julian!

02:48.460 --> 02:51.380
(Theme music)

03:32.630 --> 03:34.590
He's been living in
your trailer for one week

03:34.673 --> 03:36.134
and you totally trust him?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.718
What the <i> fuck</i> is
wrong with you?

03:37.802 --> 03:39.595
Holy fuck, man!
It's not a big deal!

03:39.678 --> 03:41.847
He went down and turned
the lights on and let
the kids in. It's fine!

03:41.931 --> 03:43.849
It's not fine!
Think about it!

03:43.933 --> 03:45.559
You think about it.
My dad warned me

03:45.643 --> 03:47.603
Randy was fucking
moving in to bust us
with the plants.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.272
That's why I moved them.
Why the fuck
would he do that?

03:50.355 --> 03:51.690
Would you please

03:51.774 --> 03:54.234
just use your brain
this one time, Ricky?

03:54.318 --> 03:56.195
What's going to
get us more time
if we get busted?

03:56.278 --> 03:58.948
Some clones, or a
rink full of plants, huh?

03:59.031 --> 04:00.240
I'm telling you,
man, you're wrong.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.492
Dad's on our side.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.744
Would you stop
calling him that?

04:03.828 --> 04:06.831
Rick... just think
about all the shit he's
done to us in our past,

04:06.914 --> 04:08.499
all the times
he tried to fucking...

04:08.582 --> 04:11.251
fuck us over and all the
effort he put into it, man.

04:11.335 --> 04:12.753
Just think about that!

04:12.837 --> 04:14.755
This could be his
biggest fuck-over ever

04:14.839 --> 04:16.757
and it's gonna be
because of you.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.010
Oh, fucking slutty
mother of horny Mary!

04:19.093 --> 04:21.178
I never really thought
about it like that.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.806
Oh, for fuck's sakes!
Fuck me!

04:23.889 --> 04:25.599
What if you are right?

04:25.683 --> 04:27.226
If he really
that fucking smart?

04:27.309 --> 04:29.937
He could be.
He's not drinking.

04:30.021 --> 04:31.647
We've got to find
out the truth, boys.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.482
Bubs, have you got
anything there?

04:33.565 --> 04:34.984
I don't know, Julian.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.612
It's all medical fucking
jargon, chromosomes-this

04:38.696 --> 04:40.114
and fucking
haemoglobin-that.

04:40.198 --> 04:42.158
I don't have the
bandwidth for this.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.784
Well, we've got to find
somebody with the brand-width.

04:43.868 --> 04:45.828
Like, who the fuck
can we get to do this?

04:45.911 --> 04:47.496
The same guy that's
gonna fix your nuts.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.165
<i>At Sam's clinic.</i>

04:49.248 --> 04:51.167
Seriously? You couldn't
wait two fucking days?

04:51.250 --> 04:52.751
You truly are
a fucking idiot.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.503
Why don't you
fuck off, okay?

04:54.586 --> 04:55.880
I've been dealing with some
pretty heavy shit lately.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.131
I had to fucking jack it.

04:57.215 --> 04:58.507
Oh, yeah.
I heard about that.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.176
Of all the fucking
people in the world,

05:00.259 --> 05:02.302
he's potentially
your father.
(Laugh)

05:02.386 --> 05:04.138
Maybe we should let
him die. He'd probably
be better off.

05:04.222 --> 05:06.598
Can you help us
prove Lahey's not
his dad or what?

05:06.682 --> 05:09.309
Look, that would
take DNA, and it's
beyond my capabilities.

05:09.393 --> 05:12.521
But, if we were to get
Lahey's blood type,

05:12.604 --> 05:14.314
his blood type and
his mother's blood type,

05:14.398 --> 05:15.900
I might be able
to help you out.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.651
Yeah, well good luck
with that one, guys.

05:17.735 --> 05:19.444
Wait, now. So if
we can get everybody's
blood type,

05:19.528 --> 05:21.530
you'll be able
to tell whether
he's lying or not?

05:21.613 --> 05:24.200
Maybe.
But what do you got?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.244
What do you mean,
what do I got?

05:26.326 --> 05:28.579
Well, the Jeep is
fucking driving great,

05:28.662 --> 05:30.206
but that was for not
cutting off his cock.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.749
This is a whole
new fucking deal.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.667
Listen, you
big-lipped fuck!

05:33.751 --> 05:36.003
You're gonna tell us
and you're gonna
fix up his fucking bag

05:36.087 --> 05:39.006
or I'm going to knock
those big, stupid teeth
down your goddamn throat

05:39.090 --> 05:41.383
and I'm going to burn
your fucking place
down to the ground!

05:41.466 --> 05:43.844
You got it?
Okay, okay! I'll do it,

05:43.928 --> 05:47.056
if... you burn
this place down.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.100
What?

05:49.183 --> 05:50.768
Look, the business
isn't doing

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
what I fucking thought
it was going to do.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.272
Obviously I know
fuck-all about Botox.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.398
I've got people coming
after me trying to sue me.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.193
But I do have two
insurance policies.

05:59.277 --> 06:02.738
So, if you burn this
fucking place down,
I'll make a killing.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.782
Deal?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.284
(Whispering)
Julian, don't do it.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.452
Come on. Deal?
Fuck, you're greasy.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.912
Yes!
Deal.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.371
Right.
So just like that?

06:11.455 --> 06:12.915
Let's fucking add arson

06:12.998 --> 06:15.209
to the fucking litany
of charges facing us.

06:15.293 --> 06:16.585
There's nothing
wrong with my arse.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.045
It's my...
my nut-bag.

06:18.129 --> 06:20.798
No, arson, Ricky!
(Sighs)

06:20.881 --> 06:22.300
Whoever alphabetized this

06:22.382 --> 06:23.717
should be taken out
and kicked in the nuts.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.219
Shh.
Just keep looking.

06:25.303 --> 06:27.054
Well, they're not
in any fucking order.

06:27.138 --> 06:29.265
There are just Q's and J's
and fucking everything!

06:29.348 --> 06:30.891
Oh, just wait!

06:30.975 --> 06:32.226
Here's Lahey!

06:32.310 --> 06:35.146
I've got Jim Lahey
right there.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.688
Oh, for fuck's sakes!

06:36.772 --> 06:39.066
There's no Flower
over here, man.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.400
Well, it's not going
to be under Flower.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.903
Think about it.
What?

06:42.987 --> 06:44.488
It's Ray Flower.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.449
No, it's Ray Lafleur.
He changed it to Flower.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.867
What the fuck are
you talking about?

06:48.951 --> 06:50.869
The truckers were
always teasing him,

06:50.953 --> 06:54.581
calling him fucking
Frenchie and frog lips
and poutine face,

06:54.665 --> 06:57.459
and he was like,
âFuck you guys, my
name's Ray Flower nowâ"

06:57.542 --> 06:59.753
Lafleur.
It's right here, Bubs,

06:59.837 --> 07:01.213
right in front of
your fucking face!

07:01.297 --> 07:02.756
Well, it's not
in any order!

07:02.840 --> 07:04.758
Look, it's in between
a Z and a fucking R!

07:04.842 --> 07:07.386
Here's Tammy's.

07:07.469 --> 07:09.429
It's not my fucking fault.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.266
Oh, this is the jackpot,
though, Julian.

07:12.350 --> 07:15.102
There's Ray's blood
right there: type A.

07:15.186 --> 07:17.104
Raymond Lafleur.
Tammy's the same thing.

07:17.188 --> 07:18.981
So what's that mean?

07:19.064 --> 07:20.399
I don't now what it means

07:20.482 --> 07:23.402
but it's fucking
critical information.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.071
Look at this:
Sexual Health Report.

07:26.155 --> 07:28.615
Look how many times
he had chlamydia!

07:28.699 --> 07:30.117
(Chuckling)
Holy fuck!

07:30.201 --> 07:32.953
Call Guinness Records!
(Wheezing laughter)

07:33.037 --> 07:35.122
Just gotta get Lahey's,
and we'll be all set.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.957
Yeah, do you think
he's just going
to give it to us?

07:37.041 --> 07:38.625
All we can do
now is ask him.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.294
We're not going
to fucking ask
him for it, man!

07:40.378 --> 07:42.504
He's going to know
we're up to something.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.006
But how the fuck are
we going to get it?

07:44.089 --> 07:45.299
I know how
to do this, okay.

07:45.383 --> 07:47.134
It'll be easy.
Let's go. Come on!

07:49.845 --> 07:52.056
Okay, that should
just about do it.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.351
Now don't be jacking it
or fucking anybody for
the next two weeks

07:55.434 --> 07:56.977
or you're going
to wind up right
back in here again.

07:57.061 --> 07:58.812
You got it, dummy?
Yeah, trust me,

07:58.896 --> 08:01.481
I'm never fucking
going through
this again.

08:01.565 --> 08:03.692
Can I ask you a question?

08:03.775 --> 08:04.985
Yeah...?

08:05.069 --> 08:06.653
How do you keep
your bag so soft?

08:06.737 --> 08:09.323
I mean, do you use any
special creams or oils?

08:09.407 --> 08:11.992
What?
Not in a g-gay way.

08:12.076 --> 08:14.494
I mean, I've been working
on mine for a long time

08:14.578 --> 08:16.163
and it's like
a calloused
old alligator

08:16.247 --> 08:17.706
and a porcupine
fucked and had a baby.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.750
Listen, I'm not going
to fucking sit here

08:19.833 --> 08:22.294
and have a conversation
with you about how to keep
your fucking bag soft.

08:22.378 --> 08:25.172
Are we done here?
Almost.

08:25.256 --> 08:28.008
So this IV should take
about 45 minutes to go
through your system.

08:28.092 --> 08:29.760
Best thing for you to do

08:29.843 --> 08:31.845
is to get back on
the gurney, lay back
and relax, okay?

08:31.929 --> 08:34.014
Come on. Get back
on the gurney.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.515
Yeah, good idea, actually.
Shut my stupid fucking
brain down for a bit.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.559
Here, let me help you.
Here you go.

08:38.643 --> 08:42.563
Just keep your fucking
hands off me. Thanks.
Okay.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.358
Oh, fuck.

08:44.442 --> 08:49.238
(Phone rings)

08:49.321 --> 08:52.116
You gonna fucking
answer for me today,
you asshole?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.700
Oh, right on.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.952
Hello.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.413
Hey, Dad.

08:57.496 --> 09:00.540
What? What the fuck are
you talking about? When?

09:00.624 --> 09:03.043
Oh, God damn it.
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
I'll be right there!

09:03.127 --> 09:04.836
Not a good idea, Ricky.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.383
Not a good idea!
What are the
kids up to?

09:09.467 --> 09:13.220
The kids? Well, they went home.
It's pitch black in there.

09:13.304 --> 09:15.722
Ricky: <i> Did you</i>
<i>call the power company?</i>
Power company said,

09:15.806 --> 09:18.225
first thing in the morning.
That's the best they can do.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.685
<i>First thing in the morning,</i>
<i>oh my... motherfuckers,</i>
(Muttering)

09:20.769 --> 09:22.729
<i>that's not going to work.</i>
<i>The plants are going</i>
<i>to fucking die.</i>

09:22.813 --> 09:24.815
<i>First thing in the</i>
<i>morning, seriously?</i>
Seriously.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.276
<i>Those fucking assholes!</i>
Yeah, they are
a bunch of assholes...

09:27.359 --> 09:29.736
<i>That's not going to work!</i>
<i>We need to get to them</i>
<i>right the fuck now!</i>

09:29.820 --> 09:31.989
Listen, Rick...
<i>We've got to get the</i>
<i>fucking power back on!</i>

09:32.072 --> 09:34.074
You're going to have
to calm down, son.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.076
<i>For fuck's sakes...</i>
Don't worry about a thing, Rick.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.079
Everything's going to be okay.
<i>Fucking assholes.</i>

09:39.163 --> 09:41.581
Fuck me!

09:41.665 --> 09:43.417
I'll call you back, Son.

09:45.210 --> 09:47.963
What the fuck is
going on, Randy?

09:48.046 --> 09:51.008
(Slurring)
No big deal, it's just a
couple drinkie-poos,
Mr Lahey.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.468
You're drunk!

09:52.551 --> 09:54.261
Yeah, I'm frigging drunk!
Listen, Randy.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.305
You've got to get
the hell out of here
before the cops come.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.598
Frig the cops!
Let them come.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.976
I guess you'll just have
to cover for me, bud.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.645
Randy, you crashed
a motor vehicle under
the influence.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.440
It's going to be pretty
fucking hard for me to
cover you for this one!

10:06.524 --> 10:08.608
Oh, really?

10:08.692 --> 10:10.777
Well, what about all
the times I covered for
you when you were drunk

10:10.861 --> 10:14.323
and crashing cars
and pissing yourself
and shooting people?

10:14.406 --> 10:15.949
Randy, just keep it down.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.701
You're begging for people
to call the police.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.953
(Shouting)
Oh, am I being too loud?

10:20.037 --> 10:22.831
I'm sorry for frigging
being too loud, everybody!

10:22.914 --> 10:24.875
And guess what?

10:24.958 --> 10:29.463
I'm frigging resigning
as assistant trailer
park supervisor!

10:29.547 --> 10:31.131
Frig it!

10:31.215 --> 10:32.966
(Sobbing)
I can't take it, Mr. Lahey.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.511
I can't take it.
Randy, it's going
to be okay, bud.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.471
Look, just calm down.
I can't take it.

10:37.555 --> 10:40.015
I'm here for you.
Come on.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.142
Let's get in the car
and we'll take
you home, okay?

10:42.226 --> 10:43.727
I don't know,
Mr. Lahey.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.687
Come on, Randy.
I love you, bud.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.189
Come on, get in the car.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.192
You do?
You still love me?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.278
You're darn right
I do, Randy.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.738
It's going to be okay.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.073
Come on, bud.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.909
(Clicking)

10:58.992 --> 11:01.161
Fuck off!

11:01.245 --> 11:02.580
Oh, fuck!

11:07.251 --> 11:10.003
Holy fuck!
Gorilla Fingers?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.339
Oh, hi, Ricky.
Hey, man.

11:12.423 --> 11:14.674
Listen, I go
by Grant now.

11:14.758 --> 11:17.219
Mr. Gorilla Fingers is
a thing of the past, okay?

11:17.302 --> 11:19.513
And listen. I don't have
any spare change either.

11:19.597 --> 11:21.432
I gave it all to the
guy inside for a tip.

11:21.515 --> 11:23.350
I'm not bumming change
here, cock face.

11:23.434 --> 11:25.352
So you're working for
the power company now, huh?

11:25.436 --> 11:28.230
Let's just say it was
time for a... uhh...

11:28.313 --> 11:29.898
a little change
of scenery.
Yeah, I bet.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.983
Being a prison guard's
the worst job ever, man.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.194
People think you're
a fucking asshole
right off the bat.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.695
I would have
quit long ago.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.198
Well, I didn't
actually quit,
you see...

11:38.282 --> 11:41.201
they were accusing
me of doing things
down there, and...

11:41.285 --> 11:44.496
I decided to get lost
before they made a mountain
out of a molehill, you know?

11:44.580 --> 11:47.541
Yeah, I get it.
Look, man, I could
really use your help.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.209
I've got a serious
fucking power problem.

11:49.293 --> 11:51.211
Can you come and have
a look at it for me?
Ah... Listen,

11:51.295 --> 11:53.880
just put in a work order
like everyone else, okay?

11:53.964 --> 11:56.049
Look man, I don't
have time for this.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.302
Between me and you,
I'm growing a bit of dope

11:58.385 --> 12:00.429
and I've got a serious
fucking problem...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.431
If there's dope
involved here,
man, I'm out.

12:02.514 --> 12:05.559
I'm not... going to
risk my job over something
like this. No way.

12:05.643 --> 12:07.478
Come on, man.
That's not very good
customer service.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.396
Forget about it, man.
Well, you know what?

12:09.480 --> 12:11.148
I was trying to be
a nice guy here.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.941
Now look what you
made me fucking do!
Hey!

12:13.024 --> 12:14.901
Get the fuck in the
van and get over
the other side.

12:14.985 --> 12:16.778
Get in there!
...fucking shit!

12:16.861 --> 12:18.989
What's the matter
with you?
Pansy.

12:23.535 --> 12:25.370
(Indistinct shout)

12:26.997 --> 12:30.000
Fuck's sakes...

12:30.083 --> 12:31.918
Fuck off!

12:32.002 --> 12:34.754
Fuck me slowly,
would you relax!

12:34.838 --> 12:36.756
Jesus Christ!

12:36.840 --> 12:38.967
(Engine ignition)

12:39.050 --> 12:40.344
Julian:
Hey, guys.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.429
Hey, Julian.

12:42.513 --> 12:43.763
Boom! That's what
I'm talking about.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.474
All right, bring it in,
bring it in.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.100
All right, I need you guys
to round up some bottles.

12:47.184 --> 12:48.602
I got a little mission
for you, okay?

12:48.686 --> 12:50.270
We don't do
that shit anymore.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.897
Throwing bottles at
people is kids' stuff.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.816
Oh, come on!

12:54.899 --> 12:57.110
I'll give you guys a
big bag of chips each.
(Giggling)

12:57.194 --> 13:00.113
Chips? Nobody wants
chips anymore.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.948
All right, what
do you want, then?

13:02.032 --> 13:03.950
Liquor.
(Whimper)

13:04.034 --> 13:05.910
Okay, I can respect that.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.204
I'll give you a pint.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.830
What? No fucking way!

13:08.913 --> 13:10.624
You're not giving
liquor to the kids!

13:10.708 --> 13:12.543
Bubs, it's a pint
between six of them, man.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.127
It's not going to
fuck them up. Relax.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.795
Think about what
you just said.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.798
Repeat that back
to yourself.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.800
We'll do it for a pint.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.553
Julian:
Okay.
And some cigarettes.

13:22.636 --> 13:25.180
No fucking way, Ronnie.
You're not getting cigarettes!

13:25.263 --> 13:27.807
Who's the target?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.809
Lahey. I want you
to aim for the head

13:29.893 --> 13:31.811
but not the face, okay?

13:31.895 --> 13:34.481
Make sure you don't
stop until you see
blood. Got it?

13:34.565 --> 13:37.192
All right, pound it.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.694
Oh, my fuck.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.320
Unbelievable.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.822
(Engine whirring)

13:46.243 --> 13:47.745
That ought to do it.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.829
Fucking awesome,
Gorilla... Grant.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.456
You're a fucking
life-saver, man.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.083
I thought I was gonna
lose all my babies.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.501
No hard feelings?

13:54.585 --> 13:55.877
Well, I don't know
about that, Rick.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.171
My boss has got this
thing GPS'd, okay?

13:58.255 --> 14:00.048
I'm not going to get
fired over this stuff.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.593
I'm going to have to
tell him some fuckwad
with a gun held me up!

14:02.676 --> 14:04.678
What the fuck are
you talking about?

14:04.762 --> 14:06.805
Listen, man.
You seem like a nice guy.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.766
But you make a lot of bad
decisions all the time.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.684
I'm not going to get
fired over this.

14:10.768 --> 14:12.894
Hold the fuck on here!
We can work this out.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.689
What if I was to set
you up with... what about
a bunch of lobsters?

14:15.773 --> 14:18.858
Have a big lobster
party back at your
fucking office?

14:18.942 --> 14:20.902
Yeah, that sounds
pretty good, actually.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.573
My boss is a real pig
when it comes to that
fancy rich food.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.032
There we go.
That's the spirit.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.701
Let me make
a call, all right?

14:27.785 --> 14:29.536
You fuck with me today,
you're getting smashed!

14:29.620 --> 14:31.871
Just fucking letting
you know, dickhead!

14:31.955 --> 14:34.541
Yeah, what about
the garlic butter
and the salad?

14:34.625 --> 14:36.084
Can you throw in
that stuff too?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.211
What the fuck
do you think?

14:38.295 --> 14:40.922
Hey, Julian.
How's it going, man?

14:41.005 --> 14:42.549
Well, not great.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.635
Remember Gorilla Fingers,
the guard at jail?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.720
Yeah, well, he works for
the power company now.
I kidnapped him at gunpoint

14:46.804 --> 14:49.598
and he says he's going
to fucking tell on me.

14:49.681 --> 14:53.893
How soon could you
get me, like, 20,
30 pounds of lobster?

14:53.977 --> 14:56.229
Tonight? You can have
them by the morning.
Is that cool?

14:56.313 --> 14:57.564
That sounds awesome.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.232
That's fucking
perfect, Julian.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.525
Thanks, man.

15:00.609 --> 15:03.111
Yeah, whatever, Ricky.
God damn it!

15:03.194 --> 15:04.738
Looks like I'm poaching
lobsters tonight,

15:04.822 --> 15:06.364
thanks to fuckhead.

15:06.448 --> 15:07.991
Why, what did he do now?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.285
He kidnapped a power
employee at gunpoint.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.412
What?
Yup.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.205
Oh my fuck.

15:21.672 --> 15:23.423
(Screeching, thud)

15:23.507 --> 15:25.258
Randy:
Camel balls!
Sorry, Mr. Lahey.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.719
Lahey: Oh, Randy...
I'll be right
back. I gotta pee.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.514
Julian, I've got
a fucking bad
feeling about this.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.432
Bubs...
There's got to
be another option.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.017
Listen to me.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.644
Lahey's been fucking us
over our entire lives.

15:35.727 --> 15:37.228
He even tried to kill us,
for Christ's sakes!

15:37.312 --> 15:38.689
This is not going
to be that bad.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.357
Don't worry about it.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.108
Child:
Let's get him!

15:42.192 --> 15:44.778
(Glass shattering)
Lahey:
(Groaning)

15:44.862 --> 15:46.655
Child:
Keep hitting him.
Bubbles: Oh, my fuck!

15:46.738 --> 15:49.949
Jesus Christ, Julian!
They're going to kill him!

15:50.033 --> 15:52.870
Children:
Good one! Come on,
one more! Keep going!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.496
It's too much!
It's too much!

15:54.579 --> 15:56.456
Call it off right now!
No, no, hang on,

15:56.540 --> 15:58.375
I told them not to stop
until there was blood.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.335
Child:
I think I hit him in the head.
Lahey: (Growling)

16:00.418 --> 16:01.753
No, fuck this!
I'm going in.

16:01.837 --> 16:04.297
No, no, no!
Just wait a bit longer.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.299
Wait...
Child:
Keep going!

16:06.383 --> 16:08.385
Oh, my fuck.
They're going to kill him!
Okay, here.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.304
Get some blood
on these, put it in
the bag. Hurry up.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.473
What? I'm not doing that!
You fucking do it!

16:13.557 --> 16:15.141
Bubs, I can't fucking
do that! Think about it.

16:15.225 --> 16:16.976
If I go in and fucking
try to save him,

16:17.060 --> 16:19.020
he's gonna be totally
suspicious about that.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.814
Hurry up, they're going
to fucking kill him!

16:20.898 --> 16:23.400
Hurry up!
You're an asshole!

16:23.483 --> 16:26.277
Children: That's enough, you
guys. He's bleeding. Let's
get the fuck out of here!

16:26.361 --> 16:28.947
...get back here!
You stop right there!

16:29.030 --> 16:30.615
Jesus Murphy!

16:30.699 --> 16:32.534
Those little bastards!
Are you okay?

16:32.617 --> 16:34.160
Yeah, I'm okay.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.162
Here, get up.
(Grunting)

16:36.246 --> 16:38.206
I'm okay, Bubbles.
I'm okay.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.958
I was just out... uhh...

16:40.041 --> 16:43.461
collecting bugs with
that and I was...

16:43.545 --> 16:45.213
starting to get a cold and
just about to blow my nose.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.882
Here, you're bleeding.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.801
Luckily I've got some
nice fresh tissue there.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.386
(Groans)
Oh, Bubbles...

16:51.469 --> 16:53.972
Get back here right now!

16:54.055 --> 16:55.640
Who hired you,
you little frigging punk?

16:55.724 --> 16:57.141
Who hired you?

16:57.225 --> 16:59.018
Okay. Yes, sir.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.187
Here, you take
one for yourself.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.981
Keep some pressure on that.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.943
But I think I left
the iron on in my shed.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.361
I gotta get back.
I'll throw that away.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.905
Okay?
Okay, Bubbles.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.489
You take care of yourself.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.324
That was fucking terrible.

17:13.407 --> 17:15.660
That was terrible.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.955
Who hired you to do
this, right now? Tell me!
(Groaning)

17:19.038 --> 17:23.835
Okay. Julian promised
us a pint of rum. Ow!

17:23.919 --> 17:27.338
He said not to stop
until there was blood.

17:27.422 --> 17:28.548
Julian!

17:34.930 --> 17:36.180
How'd you make out, man?

17:36.264 --> 17:38.182
Julian, that was
fucking horrible!

17:38.266 --> 17:39.893
That was fucked!

17:39.977 --> 17:42.061
That can never
happen again!
That was fucked.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.564
I didn't think it
would be anywhere near
that fucking crazy.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.441
Did you get the blood?

17:46.524 --> 17:49.152
Yes, I got his blood!

17:49.235 --> 17:52.113
Okay, all we can do now
is go and see Sam and
see what he has to say.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.448
Oh, that's all we can do?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.241
Maybe we could actually
just get rid of that

17:55.325 --> 17:58.161
and forget that we tried
to just kill Mr. Lahey.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.746
Bubs, if we don't
use the blood

17:59.830 --> 18:01.873
to figure out if
he's Ricky's father,

18:01.957 --> 18:04.042
then he just went
through that attack for
no reason whatsoever.

18:04.125 --> 18:05.919
Is that what you
want, man? Huh?

18:06.003 --> 18:09.380
Do you want that to
be all for nothing?

18:09.464 --> 18:11.549
No!
All right.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.551
Let's go see that
big-lipped, cro-magnon-
looking motherfucker

18:13.635 --> 18:15.887
and see what he has to say.
(Engine ignition)

18:15.971 --> 18:18.056
Some people think I'm
fucking nuts but there's
been a lot of studying done

18:18.139 --> 18:19.808
saying if you talk
to your plants, they
get growed bigger.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.685
(Metallic crash)
Oh, fucking whale whores!

18:21.768 --> 18:23.728
Who the fuck left
that right there?

18:23.812 --> 18:26.731
(Sighs)
Okay.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.942
All right, my sweet little
ladies, you ready?

18:29.026 --> 18:30.777
Sunshine's back!
(Click)

18:32.529 --> 18:34.698
Ah, for fuck's sakes!
Jesus fucking Christ!

18:37.116 --> 18:38.576
(Shaky voice)
Why do you keep
fucking with me?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.745
I'm not a bad guy.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.622
Cameraman:
Don't you want to pull
the main switch there?

18:42.706 --> 18:44.916
What?
The main switch.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.127
Ohh. Ricky fucked up.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.296
Okay girls, here we go!

18:50.380 --> 18:52.131
(Loud click)
Yeah!

18:52.215 --> 18:54.300
Tan my fucking
bear's ass and tits!

18:56.260 --> 18:58.847
I am so, so fucking sorry
for what happened earlier.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.516
Please forgive me and let's
just move past this, okay?

19:01.599 --> 19:04.644
You're beautiful,
each and every one of you.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.145
I love you guys.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.231
To make up for that
bullshit earlier,

19:08.314 --> 19:09.774
I'm giving you an extra
shot of nutrients
for supper tonight.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.275
(Spritzing)

19:11.359 --> 19:13.778
How's that sound?

19:13.862 --> 19:15.279
Hear that?

19:15.363 --> 19:17.281
They are fucking pumped!

19:17.365 --> 19:19.951
Corey: Four!
Sarah:
Four words.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.745
One.
First word.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.623
Hug, hug.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.960
Touch-down!

19:29.044 --> 19:31.129
Seizure!
"Saturday Night Fever"?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.381
Four! Forty-one!

19:33.464 --> 19:35.174
(Laughing)
Fourth word.

19:35.258 --> 19:36.801
(Frustrated groan)

19:36.885 --> 19:38.553
A... angry!
Arrgh!

19:40.388 --> 19:41.639
Leapfrog! Leapfrog!

19:41.723 --> 19:43.016
Thriller.
Jesus Christ...

19:43.100 --> 19:44.976
Horny toad!

19:45.060 --> 19:46.477
It was fucking
"Dances with the Wolves",

19:46.561 --> 19:48.229
you cow-brained
tit-dummies! Fuck!

19:48.312 --> 19:50.148
Okay, I got one.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.858
Ricky:
Hey!

19:51.942 --> 19:53.610
You stupid, heartless,
fucking asshole!

19:53.693 --> 19:55.528
My dad told me
what you did.
Yeah?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.614
What the fuck are
you doing kidnapping
people, huh?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.657
And thank you, I'm really
looking forward to
poaching lobsters tonight

19:59.741 --> 20:01.868
because of you,
for fuck's sakes!
Yeah?

20:01.952 --> 20:03.995
Well, I'm really
fucking happy you
almost killed my dad!

20:04.079 --> 20:06.330
Look, Ricky, that was
completely fucked.
We're sorry.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.916
Is he okay?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.709
Don't tell me you
were part of this.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.335
I guess you can go
fuck yourself too then!

20:11.419 --> 20:13.004
Ricky,
I didn't want to be!

20:13.088 --> 20:14.672
I didn't really have
a fucking choice.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.674
There's always a choice.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.718
That's why the
fucking guy choiced
to invent the word!

20:18.802 --> 20:20.720
Look, man.
I'm really sorry, okay?

20:20.804 --> 20:23.014
I had to get his blood,
that's the only thing
I could come up with.

20:23.098 --> 20:24.975
That's the only thing
you could come up with?

20:25.058 --> 20:26.851
Smashing my dad,
the great-grandfather
of fucking Motel,

20:26.935 --> 20:28.728
in the head with bottles?

20:28.812 --> 20:30.688
Why didn't you just
ask him for his
blood type, dummy?

20:30.772 --> 20:33.108
I didn't think it was
going to be that crazy.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.193
I said I was sorry, man.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.361
Okay, can we be cool?
Because we've got a lot
of shit to do.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.823
"Can we be cool?"
No, we can't
fucking be cool.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.033
Right now my brain's in
override trying to sort out
all these think-ages.

20:42.117 --> 20:44.368
And it's really
fucking pissed off
at both of you.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.080
So guess what?
One for you,
and two for you!

20:47.164 --> 20:50.083
Fuck yourselves!
Nice.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.585
This is great, Julian.
Really fucking nice.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.254
Way to go. You can
have one from me too.

20:55.338 --> 20:57.298
Yeah? Well, one
right back at you.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.967
Yeah? Well, two
right back at you.

20:59.050 --> 21:00.802
Two back at you.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.054
Three back at you,
counting my wiener.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.223
Always got to bring up
your wiener, don't you? Huh?

21:05.306 --> 21:08.059
Yeah, because
you always...
ask me about it.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.394
Ah, fuck off!
Ask me how it is,

21:10.478 --> 21:12.396
and if it's still
smooth and...
Fuck...

21:12.480 --> 21:14.899
(Dogs barking)

21:16.359 --> 21:18.277
(Clicking, thud)

21:27.996 --> 21:29.455
(Lighter clicking)

21:32.500 --> 21:36.754
(Whispering)
Come on, light...

21:36.838 --> 21:38.215
(Click)

21:40.091 --> 21:42.135
(Glass shattering,
flames roaring)

21:44.012 --> 21:45.471
All right. Let's go.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.685
Bubbles:
Guess this isn't so bad.

21:50.768 --> 21:52.687
You guys seem to be getting
along pretty good...

21:52.770 --> 21:54.605
together. This is great.

21:54.689 --> 21:57.192
I can love you guys
equally as much

21:57.275 --> 21:58.860
and there's nothing
wrong with that.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.945
(Giggling)
(Knocking on door)

22:01.029 --> 22:03.281
Julian:
Bubs.
Go away. I'm busy.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.449
I'll just be
a minute, man.

22:05.533 --> 22:08.786
I've still got to go out
and do some fucking
poaching, for fuck's sakes.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.289
Yeah, I was just
listening to the
news there, Julian.

22:11.372 --> 22:13.332
Heard Sam had a bit
of a fucking fire.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.376
Yeah, he did.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.128
Yeah, I wonder
how that started.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.838
Look man,
this is important.

22:18.922 --> 22:21.258
Yeah? Well, guess what?

22:21.340 --> 22:24.010
Me losing my other best
friend 'cause of you,
that's important to me.

22:24.094 --> 22:26.637
Like, what are we
going to do now?
Everything's fucked.

22:26.721 --> 22:29.974
Well, things just
got even more fucked.

22:30.058 --> 22:32.977
How?
I got the results
from Sam.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.813
We were right.
Lahey's definitely
not Ricky's father.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.191
It's impossible with
their blood types.

22:38.275 --> 22:41.360
Oh, my sweet fuck!

22:41.444 --> 22:44.697
Yeah, it's bad, man.
But guess what else?

22:44.781 --> 22:46.199
What?

22:46.283 --> 22:49.327
(Sigh)

22:49.410 --> 22:52.914
Ray's not Ricky's
father either.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.999
(Whispering)
Oh, my God.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.168
Ray's not Ricky's
father...

22:58.336 --> 23:01.214
(Theme music)

23:42.964 --> 23:45.383
(Seabirds squawking)

23:57.979 --> 24:01.732
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

24:01.816 --> 24:04.610
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

24:08.489 --> 24:09.824
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

24:09.907 --> 24:12.160
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>
