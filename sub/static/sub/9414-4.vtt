WEBVTT

00:05.125 --> 00:06.461
Over to there, 7 and 8?

00:06.462 --> 00:07.694
Sold $27.

00:07.695 --> 00:08.796
A voice said..

00:08.797 --> 00:10.633
"I see you bought the Dybbuk Box".

00:10.634 --> 00:11.935
A Dybbuk Box?

00:11.936 --> 00:13.322
It's what my Grandmother called it.

00:13.323 --> 00:16.585
I'm Jewish, and I know what a Dybbuk is.

00:16.586 --> 00:19.808
It's they type of a thing that
you use to scare little kids.

00:19.809 --> 00:22.449
Just pure evil.

00:22.476 --> 00:25.905
Say, hi to our new roommate.

00:25.906 --> 00:30.784
All of a sudden, something's
tearing inside of me.

00:30.785 --> 00:32.765
Jason?

00:36.392 --> 00:40.832
Don't do that, or the Dybbuk will come.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

01:12.528 --> 01:15.980
My shop is located in downtown Portland

01:15.981 --> 01:18.943
right at the base of the Burnside Bridge,

01:18.944 --> 01:23.272
which is kind of the gateway to the city.

01:23.273 --> 01:26.342
What I was looking for
were small, unique items

01:26.343 --> 01:30.780
that I could sell, I could retail, and
the best place to find those anytime

01:30.781 --> 01:35.484
is at yard sales, garage sales,
and estate sales, small auctions.

01:35.485 --> 01:36.886
Hi.

01:36.887 --> 01:40.556
So on this particular day, the family
was selling items that had belonged

01:40.557 --> 01:44.609
to the Grandmother who had passed
away who was a Holocaust Survivor

01:44.610 --> 01:47.963
and who had died at a ripe old age.

01:47.964 --> 01:51.084
I believe it was 103.

01:51.286 --> 01:54.000
They were selling things in job lots
that had all been grouped together

01:54.001 --> 01:55.469
on these pallets.

01:55.470 --> 01:59.140
But there was one pallet in
particular that I was interested in.

01:59.141 --> 02:02.142
Our next lot, 29, is a unique box lot here.

02:02.143 --> 02:03.977
All righty, how about..
Would you go $5, Sir?

02:03.978 --> 02:04.944
Thank you. Now $7.50.

02:04.945 --> 02:06.245
$7.50 and $10. $10, friend.

02:06.246 --> 02:08.816
$10, now $12.50. Now we're gonna go $15.

02:08.817 --> 02:13.110
I think it got to about 27 or 28 bucks
before finally, people got tired

02:13.111 --> 02:15.488
and realized that I was
going to get that pallet.

02:15.489 --> 02:16.909
Over to there, 7 and 8?

02:16.910 --> 02:20.690
Sold $27. Number 35, thank you.

02:21.796 --> 02:23.845
I was really happy, because I had got

02:23.846 --> 02:27.830
several hundred dollars worth
of items that I really needed.

02:27.831 --> 02:31.057
But along with those items,
there were three items

02:31.058 --> 02:34.441
that were unusual to be
included in a lot like this.

02:34.442 --> 02:36.486
One of them was a steamer trunk.

02:36.487 --> 02:40.313
The other one was a sewing box.

02:40.314 --> 02:45.385
And the final item was a cabinet
of sorts, a small wine cabinet.

02:45.386 --> 02:47.720
And a voice said..

02:47.721 --> 02:50.323
"I see you bought the Dybbuk Box".

02:50.324 --> 02:52.664
Dybbuk Box?

02:53.026 --> 02:56.462
The young lady being in
her late 20s, early 30s.

02:56.463 --> 03:00.821
It didn't immediately register
that she had used the word Dybbuk.

03:00.822 --> 03:03.069
I'm Jewish, and I know what a Dybbuk is.

03:03.070 --> 03:06.372
It's the type of a thing that
you use to scare little kids.

03:06.373 --> 03:08.975
You'd say, don't do that,
or the Dybbuk will come.

03:08.976 --> 03:10.710
It's what my Grandmother called it.

03:10.711 --> 03:14.046
And she explained to me that
whenever anybody would ask about it,

03:14.047 --> 03:17.517
Grandmother would spit through
her fingers three times.

03:17.518 --> 03:21.598
And say it was never to be opened.

03:21.638 --> 03:25.601
When she told me this, it
really didn't phase me

03:25.602 --> 03:28.361
as being anything that
was all that special.

03:28.362 --> 03:33.908
So I loaded up the stuff that I
had bought, and away I went.

03:33.909 --> 03:37.749
All in all, it was a good day.

03:39.338 --> 03:42.173
So I drove back to my shop.

03:42.174 --> 03:46.190
It was a small storefront perhaps..

03:46.191 --> 03:50.882
25 feet wide, and the basement
down below was quite a bit larger.

03:50.883 --> 03:55.443
It was probably 4,000, 4,500 square feet.

03:58.869 --> 04:02.423
The way the box was locked was
that there was a brass hasp

04:02.424 --> 04:06.864
with a small brass padlock placed on it.

04:07.366 --> 04:11.735
So instead of cutting the lock off,
which I normally would have done,

04:11.736 --> 04:14.805
I took a small screwdriver
and sort of bent the hasp

04:14.806 --> 04:19.726
or the metal part that
came down and held it.

04:31.323 --> 04:33.291
The doors opened.

04:33.292 --> 04:34.992
I didn't expect that.

04:34.993 --> 04:37.101
It must have had a mechanism.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.365
It was a nice touch to a box that
really didn't look like it deserved

04:40.366 --> 04:42.382
that kind of detail.

04:42.383 --> 04:44.602
There were quite a few items on the inside

04:44.603 --> 04:46.903
that really didn't make
a lot of sense to me.

04:46.904 --> 04:51.164
There were two pennies from the 1920s.

04:51.182 --> 04:55.207
A candlestick, kind of a
fat, pear-shaped body.

04:55.208 --> 04:58.988
A small chalice or wine goblet.

04:59.441 --> 05:02.919
Um, there was also a statue.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.654
It was made out of granite,
different pieces of granite,

05:05.655 --> 05:11.175
and it had carved into it the
word "shalom" in Hebrew.

05:11.427 --> 05:14.547
And then there were two locks of hair.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.468
Hair?

05:17.066 --> 05:20.500
What crossed my mind was
that this was an old lady

05:20.501 --> 05:23.516
who had kept it for some
sentimental reason,

05:23.517 --> 05:26.514
not giving it any more thought
than I would normally give

05:26.515 --> 05:30.115
a small, little wine cabinet.

05:33.817 --> 05:37.782
I had a young lady that
worked for me at that time

05:37.783 --> 05:41.452
named Jane who was absolutely
a fantastic salesperson.

05:41.453 --> 05:45.501
So on this particular day, I
left her in charge of the shop,

05:45.502 --> 05:49.222
left the box in the basement..

05:50.667 --> 05:56.187
And went about my business
taking care of some errands.

05:58.319 --> 06:01.878
I was down in the back of the basement
and kind of cleaning things up

06:01.879 --> 06:04.481
and organizing his tools and everything,

06:04.482 --> 06:08.118
and then I was gonna go
up and open the store.

06:08.119 --> 06:10.688
All of a sudden, I just.. I kind of felt..

06:10.689 --> 06:14.349
Like somebody was watching me.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.594
I had been left there alone several times,

06:17.595 --> 06:20.796
and I could walk in the dark
and down through the basement

06:20.797 --> 06:26.697
and spend hours down there and
never felt anything until then.

06:27.703 --> 06:30.653
There's a difference between..

06:30.654 --> 06:34.794
Being afraid of someone or something.

06:44.453 --> 06:47.933
I had gotten a phone call.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.157
- Addy's market. Jane speaking.
- And it was a friend of mine.

06:51.158 --> 06:54.218
Oh, hey. Hey, Geneva.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.965
Yeah, no, you can come tomorrow.
That's fine.

06:55.966 --> 06:57.804
I'll just tell Kevin.

06:57.805 --> 07:00.002
Yeah, I know. That's fine.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.039
Yeah, when are you planning to come in?

07:02.040 --> 07:03.960
Okay.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.609
Hey, um, I got to go.

07:07.610 --> 07:09.767
I had that feeling inside..

07:09.768 --> 07:13.051
Inside my gut that something was wrong.

07:13.052 --> 07:15.032
Hello?

07:21.281 --> 07:23.741
Who's there?

07:26.816 --> 07:28.796
Hello?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.552
We're not opened yet.

07:34.553 --> 07:38.431
And when I turned around, the
light that I had switched off..

07:38.432 --> 07:41.072
Turned back on.

07:43.149 --> 07:45.484
It was glass breaking.

07:45.485 --> 07:49.805
Just like.. It was it was.. Very loud.

07:52.882 --> 07:55.106
Oh, my God.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.507
Oh, my God.

07:58.632 --> 08:01.032
Oh, my God.

08:01.668 --> 08:06.768
I went, and I grabbed the phone.
I called Kevin.

08:07.123 --> 08:09.208
Kevin, pick up. Kevin, pick up.

08:09.209 --> 08:11.231
Kevin, pick up.

08:11.232 --> 08:12.912
Kevin, pick up the phone.
Kevin, pick up the phone.

08:12.913 --> 08:16.693
Kevin, pick up. Kevin, pick up.

08:21.054 --> 08:24.834
Kevin, pick up. Kevin, pick up.

08:28.962 --> 08:30.162
Hello?

08:30.163 --> 08:31.597
- Kevin?
- Jane?

08:31.598 --> 08:33.899
I can barely hear you.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.957
Someone's here.

08:35.957 --> 08:38.022
Somebody's in the store?

08:38.023 --> 08:41.693
I was yelling. I'm like, when
are you gonna get back here?

08:41.693 --> 08:46.212
To me, it sounded like it was a
baseball bat smashing things.

08:46.213 --> 08:47.531
Hysterical is the only way to put it.

08:47.532 --> 08:52.051
She was trying to tell me that there
was somebody in the basement..

08:52.052 --> 08:53.277
Something's here, Kevin.

08:53.278 --> 08:56.822
That sounded like they were breaking glass.
They were throwing things around.

08:56.823 --> 09:00.793
- I said, well, who's down there?
- And she said, nobody's down there.

09:00.794 --> 09:02.562
Jane, okay..

09:02.563 --> 09:05.933
Call the police.
Call the police immediately.

09:05.934 --> 09:07.894
- Jane.
- And as I said that..

09:07.895 --> 09:11.195
- Jane!
- My phone died.

09:12.086 --> 09:14.546
Kevin! Kevin!

09:14.965 --> 09:17.543
And I was scared to death for her.

09:17.544 --> 09:21.839
Could have been someone that
really had some bad intent,

09:21.840 --> 09:24.483
either to steal something
or to harm or to rob.

09:24.484 --> 09:27.544
It couldn't be good.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.460
Jane?

10:06.312 --> 10:07.172
Jane.

10:07.173 --> 10:09.342
I approached the back of the shop.

10:09.343 --> 10:13.063
I didn't know what to expect.

10:16.843 --> 10:20.743
So I went to the basement door..

10:20.961 --> 10:23.426
And I noticed that the wrought-iron gate

10:23.427 --> 10:28.947
was locked, which was odd,
because I hadn't locked it.

10:31.235 --> 10:32.936
Jane, it's Kevin.

10:32.937 --> 10:36.564
I went to turn on the lights at that point.
I flipped the switch.

10:36.565 --> 10:39.310
And the lights wouldn't go on.

10:39.311 --> 10:44.471
So I grabbed a flashlight
and took a look around.

10:44.984 --> 10:47.764
And it was then that I noticed that..

10:47.765 --> 10:50.384
All the light bulbs in the
basement had been broken.

10:50.385 --> 10:53.733
There were ten four-foot..

10:53.734 --> 10:55.760
Fluorescent fixtures.

10:55.761 --> 11:01.661
All of them had been broken out
and were lying on the ground.

11:09.811 --> 11:11.611
Oh.

11:12.978 --> 11:16.581
Jane isn't the kind of person who cries.

11:16.582 --> 11:17.915
Well, literally, she said..

11:17.916 --> 11:20.221
(Bleep) You.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.987
I just had this feeling that I had to go.

11:22.988 --> 11:24.121
Jane?

11:24.122 --> 11:27.079
I just left, and I never came back.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.060
There is no exit. There is no way out.
There's no crawl space.

11:30.061 --> 11:31.928
There's nowhere for anyone to go.

11:31.929 --> 11:34.931
Whoever had done this
had to still be there.

11:34.932 --> 11:38.186
Because I had just unlocked the gate.
There was no way out.

11:38.187 --> 11:39.944
I had to think at that
time that it was Jane.

11:39.945 --> 11:42.474
I had to think that, because
there is no other explanation,

11:42.475 --> 11:44.419
and there was nobody else there.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.856
So it was her, and I was sorry I upset her,

11:47.857 --> 11:52.237
but there could be no other explanation.

12:02.571 --> 12:06.199
So my Mom's birthday is on October 28th,

12:06.200 --> 12:09.877
and we were gonna go have
lunch and do something else.

12:09.878 --> 12:15.757
And on that day, she came down to the
shop quite early before I was open.

12:15.758 --> 12:17.919
- Happy Birthday, Mom.
- Oh, darling.

12:17.920 --> 12:23.758
There was a small, little display area
of some furniture, and so she sat down.

12:23.759 --> 12:28.859
And he said, this is an
unusual present for you.

12:35.105 --> 12:39.605
In the past, I have gotten strange gifts.

12:40.008 --> 12:44.939
Not a wine cabinet, but,
you know, strange gifts.

12:44.940 --> 12:47.627
My husband used to give me plaid coats,

12:47.628 --> 12:50.688
every single birthday.

12:51.104 --> 12:55.824
He knew I hated plaid and
that I would return the coat

12:55.825 --> 12:58.416
and get something that I liked.

12:58.417 --> 13:00.394
- Kevin, there's a call for you.
- Okay.

13:00.395 --> 13:05.675
When he went downstairs, I
looked at the box, and..

13:06.793 --> 13:11.953
It was as though the box
was looking back at me.

13:15.771 --> 13:18.351
Kevin speaking.

13:34.898 --> 13:38.378
Yup. No, we still have it.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.360
The doors opened, and it was just

13:51.361 --> 13:55.081
like a cold breeze coming out.

13:57.193 --> 13:59.255
I can't describe it.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.569
Just pure..

14:01.570 --> 14:02.992
Evil.

14:02.993 --> 14:05.459
I couldn't run away. I couldn't get up.

14:05.460 --> 14:09.120
I couldn't get away from it.

14:10.067 --> 14:13.787
I knew I was having a stroke.

14:14.442 --> 14:16.722
My mouth..

14:16.865 --> 14:18.287
Contorted.

14:18.288 --> 14:22.788
Just started to sag, and my eye pocketed.

14:25.471 --> 14:27.689
Mrs. Mannis?

14:27.690 --> 14:29.187
Kevin?

14:29.188 --> 14:32.188
Am I gonna make it?

14:32.231 --> 14:34.393
Is this death?

14:34.394 --> 14:37.906
And my thought was, Kevin is downstairs.

14:37.907 --> 14:42.107
Am I gonna die before I see my son?

14:42.233 --> 14:45.053
Is he gonna know?

14:47.232 --> 14:50.232
Am I gonna make it?

14:52.695 --> 14:54.137
Mom.

14:54.138 --> 14:56.658
I was frozen.

14:57.267 --> 15:00.087
I couldn't leave.

15:01.479 --> 15:03.484
Okay, they're here now.

15:03.485 --> 15:07.440
It was only me that could tell,
because she didn't have enough..

15:07.441 --> 15:11.927
Ability to express herself, but you
could see the terror in her eyes.

15:11.928 --> 15:15.816
And I wanted to..
I had to communicate to him.

15:15.817 --> 15:18.457
To protect him.

15:19.218 --> 15:23.006
And it was almost impossible to do.

15:23.007 --> 15:26.429
When you're having a
stroke, you can't write.

15:26.430 --> 15:29.045
You can't talk.

15:29.046 --> 15:30.691
All the communication was through her eyes,

15:30.692 --> 15:33.307
and so her eyes were kind of
wandering, and yet, you could tell.

15:33.308 --> 15:37.400
You could tell that she was
pleading to get something out.

15:37.401 --> 15:38.917
To say something.

15:38.918 --> 15:42.106
The one thing that I wanted to do.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.144
Was to impress upon him..

15:45.145 --> 15:47.677
How important it was..

15:47.678 --> 15:51.278
That he get rid of the box.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.487
God forbid..

16:09.276 --> 16:12.516
It did anything to him.

16:12.518 --> 16:15.189
If it gave me a stroke.

16:15.190 --> 16:18.366
What would it do to him?

16:18.367 --> 16:20.231
I probably should have
picked a better gift,

16:20.232 --> 16:22.779
maybe taken a little bit
more time in choosing it.

16:22.780 --> 16:25.836
It never crossed my mind that it would
be anything other than what it was..

16:25.837 --> 16:27.656
A small box.

16:27.657 --> 16:31.201
I knew that it was something that was evil,

16:31.202 --> 16:34.202
because I had felt..

16:34.658 --> 16:37.598
The coldness inside.

16:40.691 --> 16:43.155
Everything started to fall into place now,

16:43.156 --> 16:47.222
all hell breaking loose with the
shop, with my Mom having the stroke.

16:47.223 --> 16:50.634
The common denominator of all
these things was this box.

16:50.635 --> 16:54.064
So I decided to try and sell it.

16:54.065 --> 16:59.042
And a few days later, an older
couple came in and purchased it.

16:59.043 --> 17:01.323
And didn't think anything about it.

17:01.324 --> 17:06.964
Glad to see it gone.
I got more stuff to do than that.

17:08.938 --> 17:14.765
And I find the box sitting by the
front door with a note on it.

17:14.766 --> 17:16.945
And the note read..

17:16.946 --> 17:21.087
"This has an odd darkness about it".

17:21.536 --> 17:23.648
This is hard to get rid of.

17:23.650 --> 17:26.353
Nobody seems to like it.

17:26.354 --> 17:28.502
I had a storage unit out
in back of my house

17:28.502 --> 17:30.885
that I decided I would put it there..

17:30.886 --> 17:36.437
And hopefully forget about it until I
could figure out what to do with it.

17:36.438 --> 17:39.237
I started to have dreams.

17:39.238 --> 17:41.878
Terrible dreams.

17:41.982 --> 17:46.325
I would be with somebody
who I knew and I trusted.

17:46.326 --> 17:50.923
I would be in a very pleasant setting with
this person, and we would be walking.

17:50.924 --> 17:56.008
And at that point, immediately,
whoever I was with in the dream..

17:56.009 --> 17:59.669
Would change from that person.

17:59.852 --> 18:02.248
Into the most gruesome,

18:02.249 --> 18:05.729
horrible, evil-looking hag..

18:05.792 --> 18:07.736
I'd ever seen.

18:07.737 --> 18:13.637
And that hag would proceed to just
beat the living crap out of me.

18:19.519 --> 18:21.861
When I woke up..

18:21.862 --> 18:27.762
I know that this sounds unbelievable,
because I didn't believe it myself.

18:33.908 --> 18:35.974
I found bruises.

18:35.975 --> 18:41.512
Something is happening where I'm
getting injured in the night.

18:41.513 --> 18:43.740
And it got to the point
where every single night,

18:43.741 --> 18:45.790
I knew that I would be having this dream.

18:45.791 --> 18:50.456
No matter what I thought of, no matter
how I tried, this was going to happen.

18:50.457 --> 18:55.497
At that moment, I knew
that the box was cursed,

18:55.695 --> 19:00.495
that there was something
wrong with that box.

19:00.833 --> 19:04.043
But I decided I had to get rid of it.

19:04.044 --> 19:09.454
And it turns out the quickest way to be
rid of it would be to put it on eBay.

19:09.455 --> 19:12.823
And it called it the Dybbuk
Box in the main heading.

19:12.824 --> 19:16.115
And then described it as a
haunted Jewish wine cabinet.

19:16.116 --> 19:19.678
And I certainly wasn't going to sell
it without disclosing everything

19:19.679 --> 19:23.155
that I thought had been happening.

19:23.156 --> 19:26.596
My hope was that somebody
who dealt with the occult.

19:26.597 --> 19:29.893
Would see this and buy it and
dispose of it the way that they..

19:29.894 --> 19:34.994
The way that they knew it
should be disposed of.

19:41.650 --> 19:44.299
When I first learned about the
Dybbuk Box, I was a student

19:44.300 --> 19:49.278
at Truman State University
in Kirksville, Missouri.

19:49.279 --> 19:51.883
- What are you looking at?
- eBay.

19:51.884 --> 19:56.745
My roommate Sam had seen this
posting for this haunted box.

19:56.746 --> 20:00.706
- What is that?
- The Dybbuk Box.

20:00.726 --> 20:03.328
And he was telling me about how the owner

20:03.329 --> 20:06.664
was experiencing very terrible nightmares..

20:06.665 --> 20:08.066
- Haunted?
- Mm-hmm.

20:08.067 --> 20:11.403
That his Mother, I believe,
had become really sick.

20:11.404 --> 20:15.718
It was this really long description
of what had transpired,

20:15.719 --> 20:18.183
and it really captured our imagination.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.304
You want in? Come on.

20:21.453 --> 20:24.415
- Really?
- I'm okay.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.696
All right.

20:27.729 --> 20:31.089
I didn't really want to spend money
on something that could be a hoax,

20:31.090 --> 20:32.790
and that was really the end of it.

20:32.791 --> 20:37.895
We didn't really talk about
it after that at all.

20:37.896 --> 20:41.733
During the course of the week,
it finally got up to a number

20:41.734 --> 20:46.336
of about 7,500 people that had seen this,
and I've sold a lot of stuff on eBay

20:46.337 --> 20:47.804
and never had that kind of a response,

20:47.805 --> 20:51.536
so I thought, maybe there are a lot
of people involved in the occult.

20:51.537 --> 20:57.437
7,500 is a lot of people to watch
a little wine cabinet sell.

21:02.453 --> 21:06.251
About three weeks later
in the middle of June.

21:06.252 --> 21:09.192
I had come home for lunch,

21:09.193 --> 21:13.926
and I opened up our front door,
which entered into our living room,

21:13.927 --> 21:18.401
and I was instantly hit by this
overwhelming stench of urine.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.971
There was newspaper and packing peanuts

21:20.972 --> 21:25.008
strewn throughout.. All over our
floor, and my instant thoughts were,

21:25.009 --> 21:30.909
who made this mess, and where did
somebody urinate in my living room?

21:35.153 --> 21:39.630
And it was just sitting there
staring at me and me staring at it.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.928
And I was thinking, I can't
believe he bought it.

21:42.929 --> 21:46.469
Say hi to our new roommate.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.733
After I got over that initial
shock that he bought it,

21:49.734 --> 21:54.712
I laughed, because I couldn't
believe he spent his money on this.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.827
Once, though, the Dybbuk
Box was in my house,

21:56.828 --> 21:58.859
I really wanted to go into
this with an open mind.

21:58.860 --> 22:03.681
I didn't want to think that this
thing was actually haunted.

22:03.682 --> 22:06.981
Well, what are we gonna do with this?

22:06.982 --> 22:08.584
And he said..

22:08.585 --> 22:10.889
I'm gonna sleep with it.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.476
Well, I think Sam was really curious.

22:12.477 --> 22:15.465
If there was any spirit trapped in the box,

22:15.466 --> 22:20.196
maybe antagonize it a little bit saying,
are you gonna come out and play?

22:20.197 --> 22:22.057
Ooh!

22:55.919 --> 22:58.988
It had a very prominent
spot in the living room.

22:58.989 --> 23:00.689
We didn't ever hide the box.

23:00.690 --> 23:05.028
Yeah, I bought it on eBay for, like,
really cheap too for an antique.

23:05.029 --> 23:07.064
It was only 140 bucks.

23:07.065 --> 23:10.534
Once everybody got done
checking out the Dybbuk Box,

23:10.535 --> 23:14.372
we would say just kind of off-the-cuff,
by the way, this is cursed,

23:14.373 --> 23:18.178
and you might have nightmares
for the rest of the semester

23:18.179 --> 23:19.445
or possibly your life.

23:19.446 --> 23:20.413
Yo, guys.

23:20.414 --> 23:23.147
It was a big novelty, and people were

23:23.148 --> 23:25.819
kind of laughing around and joking around.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.911
Time has come to open..

23:28.912 --> 23:30.124
The box.

23:30.125 --> 23:34.095
Some of the girls got
quite upset and disturbed

23:34.096 --> 23:37.364
by the fact that this was a
potentially haunted artifact.

23:37.365 --> 23:39.225
Ooh.

23:45.782 --> 23:47.702
Whoa.

23:51.415 --> 23:52.662
Come on, it's funny.

23:52.663 --> 23:55.046
She got upset that her
hand was put in the box,

23:55.047 --> 23:59.223
that she potentially exposed
herself to this possessed spirit.

23:59.224 --> 24:02.903
She was definitely freaked out, and she was

24:02.904 --> 24:05.896
concerned for her safety and ours.

24:05.897 --> 24:07.498
But we were just having fun.

24:07.499 --> 24:11.699
We were just having pranks on people.

24:11.770 --> 24:14.539
But there came a point whenever..

24:14.540 --> 24:17.375
We realized that things
were about to change.

24:17.376 --> 24:19.577
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh, you know..

24:19.578 --> 24:24.381
We experienced some really
unusual things with electronics.

24:24.382 --> 24:26.585
How was last night?

24:26.586 --> 24:30.155
- Oh, you know..
- Studying the..

24:30.156 --> 24:31.557
Whoa! Jeez!

24:31.558 --> 24:33.125
Whoa.

24:33.126 --> 24:36.589
- Okay, this is..
- What the hell, man?

24:36.590 --> 24:40.130
What the hell just happened?

24:40.760 --> 24:45.740
He was telling me that
his laptop just crashed.

24:46.207 --> 24:47.743
Whoa.

24:47.744 --> 24:52.664
It was a critical failure
with the hard drive.

24:58.869 --> 25:04.463
Well, I woke up one morning
and was getting ready to go,

25:04.464 --> 25:07.399
and one of my roommates came out of
his bedroom, which was next to mine,

25:07.400 --> 25:09.568
and he looked awful.

25:09.569 --> 25:12.834
His eyes were all bloodshot.

25:12.835 --> 25:15.711
Um, bloody.. Almost.. Looking.

25:15.712 --> 25:19.912
Um, and it looked really, really bad.

25:26.986 --> 25:30.021
And then there was these bugs
that were crawling all over.

25:30.022 --> 25:31.523
We found them in our living room.

25:31.524 --> 25:34.960
They were crawling up the
walls in our bedroom.

25:34.961 --> 25:38.558
Um, they were in our
kitchen and our bathrooms.

25:38.559 --> 25:41.373
They would be in the sink, or they would
be on the walls or in the mirror,

25:41.374 --> 25:46.305
or around the toilet, or wherever it
may be, They got into everywhere.

25:46.306 --> 25:48.675
Over the summer and into the fall,

25:48.676 --> 25:51.010
Sam started to become a
little bit more reclusive.

25:51.011 --> 25:55.211
So we got to see him less and less.

26:14.602 --> 26:16.870
I felt really bad for Sam.

26:16.871 --> 26:22.771
I felt that there was despair and
that he was really just done

26:23.577 --> 26:26.413
and hopefully that getting rid of the box

26:26.414 --> 26:32.314
would be a turning point for him
where he could start to recover.

26:33.722 --> 26:37.703
I'm the Director in a medical museum.
I've always had a love of history

26:37.704 --> 26:39.844
and the artifacts that tell
the stories of history,

26:39.845 --> 26:44.766
so we're always looking at objects
as puzzles to be unraveled.

26:44.767 --> 26:48.770
Sam was keeping online in a personal blog

26:48.771 --> 26:51.306
all the things that had happened to him.

26:51.307 --> 26:54.876
So I could actually follow
week-by-week all of the things

26:54.877 --> 26:57.345
that were going on with this box.

26:57.346 --> 27:02.049
If I could get this box, I could
rationalize pretty much through

27:02.050 --> 27:07.088
what I would consider a scientific basis,
is it what it was supposed to be?

27:07.089 --> 27:09.839
Looking back at the words he
wrote, there was a warning

27:09.840 --> 27:14.940
that I probably should
have heeded and I didn't.

27:15.331 --> 27:20.412
When Sam listed the Dybbuk Box
on eBay, I followed the sale.

27:20.413 --> 27:22.833
No bid had been taken
place, so I just threw

27:22.834 --> 27:25.507
in a bid of uh, I think it was 50 bucks.

27:25.508 --> 27:30.145
You could see the bid price jumping
up by different dollar amounts.

27:30.146 --> 27:34.849
It would start off with $30, and then
it jumped to $45, and then maybe $50.

27:34.850 --> 27:39.220
The difference was, I had now made the
commitment that not only would I bid,

27:39.221 --> 27:41.022
I would buy this box.

27:41.023 --> 27:45.060
All of a sudden, it would be a large
jump, and it would go up to $108

27:45.061 --> 27:47.484
and then $150 and then $200.

27:47.485 --> 27:53.385
When Sam had bought it, he'd spent $140,
and so I put in a bid for double.

27:54.003 --> 27:58.874
Finally, within the last
second, it jumped to $280.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.476
Yes!

28:00.477 --> 28:04.514
Basically, I won the bid,
and so I was very excited

28:04.515 --> 28:08.290
once I knew the Dybbuk
Box could not escape me.

28:08.291 --> 28:11.400
I was taken back by it at first, thinking,

28:11.401 --> 28:13.456
well, why would someone
spend that kind of money

28:13.457 --> 28:18.737
on something that would
potentially ruin their lives?

28:25.503 --> 28:29.239
So that night, I decided to
actually examine the Dybbuk Box.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.441
It was dark.

28:30.442 --> 28:35.079
Everything was closed down on campus,
and I'd had to unlock and go through,

28:35.080 --> 28:39.400
and all of the minimal lights were on.

28:40.985 --> 28:46.624
I was already aware that both Kevin's
family and the college students

28:46.625 --> 28:52.525
had had spontaneous illnesses and what
appeared to be, like, infections.

28:54.699 --> 28:58.895
It seemed good practice to
put on the white gloves

28:58.896 --> 29:04.796
to basically examine this item just
in case there are any contaminants.

29:06.212 --> 29:10.983
So I dimmed the lights and
turned on the black light.

29:10.984 --> 29:12.622
There was a little bit of glow.

29:12.623 --> 29:18.382
It was wax, but it did indicate to
me that someone had lit a candle,

29:18.383 --> 29:20.994
and it had dripped on
the outside of the box.

29:20.995 --> 29:25.698
It made me think, this actually
could have been used ritually.

29:25.699 --> 29:31.037
So the next thing was to see
what was contained inside.

29:31.038 --> 29:34.808
The moment just before opening the doors,

29:34.809 --> 29:39.369
I kind of just wondered what would happen.

30:05.348 --> 30:09.351
Like, I guess I kind of expected that
if this thing really was haunted,

30:09.352 --> 30:12.854
it would happen immediately,
and so in opening it up

30:12.855 --> 30:15.871
and seeing all these
other pieces, and yet..

30:15.872 --> 30:20.429
The stillness, there was no
strange things happening.

30:20.430 --> 30:26.202
It was like, okay, well, maybe
it's just a historical piece.

30:26.203 --> 30:32.103
But I didn't realize how wrong I
was and what was yet to come.

30:34.011 --> 30:39.911
Within days of it being in the
museum, the computers were crashing.

30:40.184 --> 30:42.869
Yes, I've tried turning
the computer on and off.

30:42.870 --> 30:47.123
We were losing valuable
information, weeks of work.

30:47.124 --> 30:50.563
Yeah, well, my colleague's going through
the exact same thing right now.

30:50.564 --> 30:52.895
And then the light bulbs.

30:52.896 --> 30:57.634
And what was odd about it, it was the
bulbs all around where the Dybbuk Box..

30:57.635 --> 31:00.317
Where they were all going out.

31:00.318 --> 31:02.625
And just.. Then things seemed
to get a whole lot worse.

31:02.626 --> 31:05.840
Okay, well, I guess we've explored
every option from A to Z.

31:05.841 --> 31:09.878
The staff felt a depletion
of energy, illness.

31:09.879 --> 31:15.635
They made it clear that this
artifact was an unwelcome guest.

31:15.636 --> 31:18.535
Listen, I'm losing my whole office here.
I got to go.

31:18.536 --> 31:24.436
And then I knew I had to take it out
of the museum. I had no choice.

31:27.479 --> 31:33.379
I have a lockable back part of my
truck, and it was secured in there.

31:33.819 --> 31:37.288
But just driving home, you know, I just
felt that I was forced against the wall.

31:37.289 --> 31:43.189
I really didn't want to take it home,
but I thought I had no option.

31:44.241 --> 31:47.406
And that night was completely restless.

31:47.407 --> 31:52.087
I kept having dreams of these sunken-eyed..

31:52.111 --> 31:54.391
Old women.

31:54.476 --> 31:57.484
And then their face would literally just

31:57.485 --> 32:01.805
dissolve into the most ghastly injuries

32:02.571 --> 32:07.191
as if the flesh was being torn and ripped.

32:09.118 --> 32:12.791
I'd wake from these in shock
only to go back into sleep,

32:12.792 --> 32:18.692
and it started all over again, the
same women with gray, flyaway hair

32:18.775 --> 32:24.175
and sunken eyes, and it just
happened all night long.

32:32.340 --> 32:38.100
When I woke that morning, I
was just glad just to be up.

32:50.815 --> 32:56.275
And I was thinking, could I
have done this to myself?

33:05.977 --> 33:07.711
What's wrong with your eyes?

33:07.712 --> 33:10.292
I don't know.

33:10.682 --> 33:14.737
Things in my life had gotten really bad.
I mean, things had gotten really bad.

33:14.738 --> 33:19.178
Health issues, family concerned and upset.

33:20.893 --> 33:25.383
It wasn't long after um,
that, my son and I uh..

33:25.384 --> 33:31.284
Were.. It was an evening hour together
uh, down in where the TV was on.

33:36.375 --> 33:39.345
And all of a sudden, he calls over to me..

33:39.346 --> 33:41.206
Dad.

33:43.483 --> 33:46.138
- Dad.
- Yeah, buddy?

33:46.139 --> 33:48.621
- What is it?
- What?

33:48.622 --> 33:50.542
Look.

33:57.032 --> 34:01.202
It looked like flames, this black mass,

34:01.203 --> 34:04.005
and he's looking and going, what is that?

34:04.006 --> 34:08.510
And I see the true fear in my son's eyes.

34:08.511 --> 34:10.483
I was worried about my family.

34:10.484 --> 34:14.204
Now it's taking over my life.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.748
I'd explored the scientific side,
and there was no explanation

34:21.748 --> 34:26.609
for what was going on
in science, not to me.

34:29.364 --> 34:33.033
I was thinking, if this box truly
had something trapped in it

34:33.034 --> 34:37.331
and I'd released it that I
needed to do something..

34:37.331 --> 34:40.152
To seal it again.

34:40.418 --> 34:43.797
We have this rental
property that had a cellar.

34:43.799 --> 34:46.994
It wasn't being used, and so I decided

34:46.995 --> 34:50.696
that I would take the
Dybbuk Box over there,

34:50.697 --> 34:56.597
and that is where I felt would be
the best place to isolate the box.

34:57.191 --> 35:00.627
As I'm finishing up this process,

35:00.628 --> 35:05.668
the sound as if wind is
building in the space..

35:07.902 --> 35:11.024
And yet there is nothing
that could create this.

35:11.025 --> 35:14.385
We're completely entombed.

35:15.743 --> 35:19.474
Then I locked the door to the basement.

35:19.475 --> 35:23.795
Then I was done with it. It was gone.

35:33.438 --> 35:37.983
I now needed to finish it,
which was to wash myself free

35:37.984 --> 35:41.535
of any attachment of
anything that was connected

35:41.536 --> 35:45.172
to me being in the presence of this evil.

35:45.173 --> 35:49.733
The steam and the heat, it's invigorating.

35:50.244 --> 35:53.304
It's really powerful.

36:03.391 --> 36:05.371
Jason?

36:29.925 --> 36:33.715
All of a sudden, something's
tearing inside of me.

36:33.716 --> 36:35.696
Jason?

36:37.723 --> 36:42.763
And then it just comes out,
this gelluous mucus.

36:44.627 --> 36:50.387
Something I've never had out
of my body was in my hands.

36:52.194 --> 36:54.626
There's no way to explain it.

36:54.627 --> 36:58.243
It just happened, and I was in disbelief.

36:58.244 --> 36:59.062
Jason?

36:59.063 --> 37:02.091
And yet I also knew that
something came out of me.

37:02.092 --> 37:03.526
- Jason?
- What?

37:03.527 --> 37:05.573
Open the door.

37:05.574 --> 37:07.218
I got to show you something.
You got to see this.

37:07.219 --> 37:10.347
Okay. And outside the door, I
hear my wife yelling to me

37:10.348 --> 37:13.884
about something about Poison Ivy and jeans.

37:13.885 --> 37:15.903
- Jason, open the door.
- What?

37:15.904 --> 37:18.424
What is this?

37:18.589 --> 37:20.511
Have you ever seen anything like it?
Look at it.

37:20.512 --> 37:25.642
And what I'm seeing are watery blisters
that have broken out with blood,

37:25.643 --> 37:29.312
and they're all over, and it's swelling.

37:29.313 --> 37:31.056
I needed to kind of get
this thing taken care of.

37:31.057 --> 37:34.237
I needed to finish it.

37:34.285 --> 37:40.185
I needed to find Kevin Mannis, the
original owner of this Dybbuk Box.

37:44.026 --> 37:48.586
I got a call in the middle of the night.

37:51.001 --> 37:52.135
Hello?

37:52.136 --> 37:53.664
And I hung up on him.

37:53.665 --> 37:55.972
I was frightened that
somebody had a problem

37:55.973 --> 37:58.131
that I was going to have to try and solve

37:58.132 --> 38:01.845
or I was gonna have to take that box back.

38:01.846 --> 38:07.017
The phone rang again, and Jason
said, please don't hang up on me.

38:07.018 --> 38:12.298
Talk with me about this.
It's very, very important.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.941
Within a few minutes of the
conversation with Kevin,

38:15.942 --> 38:19.929
I knew that I was no longer
alone with this problem,

38:19.930 --> 38:22.926
that he was going to work with me

38:22.927 --> 38:28.827
and help me come to some way of
getting this out of my life.

38:29.306 --> 38:31.810
I went looking for the house.

38:31.811 --> 38:34.077
And had a hard time finding it at first.

38:34.078 --> 38:36.946
Couldn't remember exactly where it
was, and it took me a little bit,

38:36.947 --> 38:40.007
to finally locate it.

38:47.458 --> 38:48.755
Hi, um..

38:48.756 --> 38:52.216
I told her that I was trying to get
some information about the box.

38:52.217 --> 38:56.089
- I bought this box.
- I think you should leave.

38:56.090 --> 38:59.649
I wasn't gonna get anywhere,
so I started to take off.

38:59.650 --> 39:04.676
And I had made it maybe 10 or 15
steps when I thought she said..

39:04.677 --> 39:07.592
I know exactly why you're here.

39:07.593 --> 39:11.823
There was a little old lady
drilling me with her eyes.

39:11.824 --> 39:15.108
The woman introduced herself as Sophie.

39:15.109 --> 39:20.794
And said she was the cousin of the
woman who had passed away, Havola.

39:20.795 --> 39:23.675
And so I listened.

39:23.792 --> 39:28.483
She said that she had lived
with Havola in Poland.

39:28.484 --> 39:31.220
Prior to World War II.

39:31.221 --> 39:34.491
At that time, it was kind of the
rage in Europe to have seances,

39:34.492 --> 39:37.660
to contact the other side, to
play with games like that.

39:37.661 --> 39:40.786
And Havola had made what
looked like a Ouija Board.

39:40.787 --> 39:42.437
That was made out of a tablecloth.

39:42.438 --> 39:46.056
And on the tablecloth, she had
embroidered letters of the alphabet.

39:46.057 --> 39:47.938
And they would take a little pendant.

39:47.939 --> 39:51.316
And as they would ask questions,
the pendant would swing and

39:51.317 --> 39:57.217
either spell out a word or answer
a question that they asked.

40:00.890 --> 40:06.412
During the course of doing this, they
felt like they had contacted a spirit..

40:06.413 --> 40:10.683
That started asking them to bring
it over from the dark side,

40:10.684 --> 40:15.304
and they became suspicious that what they
had actually contacted was a Dybbuk.

40:15.305 --> 40:20.743
A dark, evil entity that would try
to grab on to one of their souls.

40:20.744 --> 40:23.045
So they devised a ritual
where they would be able

40:23.046 --> 40:28.086
to bring this thing over
and trap it in a box.

40:36.529 --> 40:39.409
That's why Havola,

40:39.548 --> 40:42.076
the Grandmother, had been so emphatic.

40:42.077 --> 40:44.460
Don't open the box..

40:44.461 --> 40:47.260
- Because what was inside is so dark..
- Because what was inside is so dark..

40:47.261 --> 40:48.973
And so terrible.

40:48.974 --> 40:52.009
Apparently, when I bought it and
brought it back down to my shop

40:52.010 --> 40:54.430
and opened it up for the
first time, I released it.

40:54.431 --> 40:57.982
The story that Kevin told me was
like nothing I'd ever heard.

40:57.983 --> 41:01.753
It seemed almost too impossible to make up.

41:01.754 --> 41:05.156
It seemed very real, he was
very earnest about it,

41:05.157 --> 41:07.458
and it started to make some sense.

41:07.459 --> 41:11.296
I contacted rabbis and got the information

41:11.297 --> 41:15.977
on the best means to seal this spirit away.

41:27.981 --> 41:30.382
Some people may think this is a hoax,

41:30.383 --> 41:35.797
but every person that has come
in contact with this box..

41:35.798 --> 41:38.892
Has suffered sickness..

41:38.893 --> 41:40.805
Calamity..

41:40.806 --> 41:43.086
Misfortune.

41:43.464 --> 41:45.423
I know that when I owned
this box, terrible,

41:45.424 --> 41:47.467
awful, rotten things happened to me.

41:47.468 --> 41:50.604
When I got rid of it, they
stopped happening to me.

41:50.605 --> 41:56.109
Everything that happened that
was bad was because of the box.

41:56.110 --> 41:59.979
People have asked me, what
would it take to buy the box?

41:59.980 --> 42:01.914
I wouldn't sell it to anyone.

42:01.915 --> 42:06.051
It weighs on my mind, because
eventually, something will change.

42:06.052 --> 42:08.320
I'm not gonna be here forever.

42:08.321 --> 42:14.125
The one dilemma is having this thing
and not knowing what to do with it.

42:14.126 --> 42:17.186
For now, it is safe.
