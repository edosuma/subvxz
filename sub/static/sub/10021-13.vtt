00:07.199 --> 00:08.223
<i>Previously on</i> ER:

00:08.434 --> 00:11.062
I've been having a problem
with Dr. Romano.

00:11.270 --> 00:13.795
Why didn't Genetics suggest
this medication?

00:14.006 --> 00:15.997
It's brand-new,
part of a clinical trial.

00:16.207 --> 00:17.937
Do I need to fill any of this out?

00:18.143 --> 00:21.271
I wouldn't. He's not a candidate
for the study.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.506
Breaking research protocol
could damage funding.

00:24.717 --> 00:27.948
- So you agree with them?
- I see their point.

00:30.689 --> 00:32.452
Doug, don't walk away.

00:34.593 --> 00:35.787
Doug?

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

05:37.029 --> 05:38.656
Jerry, have you seen Doug?

05:38.864 --> 05:41.492
He dropped off some charts.
He went up top for coffee.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.430
- "Up top"?
- As in keep your coat on.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.046
I missed you this morning.

05:56.615 --> 05:58.014
I tried not to wake you.

05:58.217 --> 06:01.345
One of us should get
more than four hours of sleep.

06:02.621 --> 06:05.613
- I love you. You know that?
- Yes, I do.

06:07.226 --> 06:10.923
Doug, what's going on? You all right?

06:11.530 --> 06:14.397
I'm not going to jump
if that's what your afraid of.

06:15.100 --> 06:18.228
That's good. I'm attached here,
so you'll take me too.

06:21.073 --> 06:24.338
- All this just about helping a kid.
- All what?

06:24.543 --> 06:28.001
- You and me getting into it.
- Hey, it's over and done.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.273
- It's not over for Mark and IKerry.
- Now, you don't know that.

06:31.483 --> 06:33.781
They don't want to make a big deal
out of this.

06:33.986 --> 06:36.477
- They have to do something.
- Why?

06:36.888 --> 06:40.551
To prove they never wanted a Pediatric
Attending in the first place.

06:40.759 --> 06:41.748
Doug.

06:45.297 --> 06:47.595
- That's not fair.
- No.

06:52.237 --> 06:54.171
You put the patient first.

06:54.373 --> 06:57.831
And that's what we're supposed to do,
isn't it?

06:59.144 --> 07:01.112
You're good to me. You know that?

07:01.446 --> 07:02.970
Yeah, I know that.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.713
Largely, it's been innuendo.

07:08.920 --> 07:12.720
The slightly inappropriate phrase
at the slightly inappropriate moment.

07:12.924 --> 07:14.915
You might not consider it
sexual harassment.

07:15.127 --> 07:17.687
If you could give me some specifics.

07:18.030 --> 07:22.558
The more ridiculous one was when
he spoke of "sniffing my tail pipe."

07:23.101 --> 07:25.763
- Excuse me?
- Well, I'd just parked.

07:25.971 --> 07:29.634
And he said words to the effect
that had he known it was my car...

07:29.841 --> 07:31.968
...he would have
"sniffed my tail pipe."

07:33.512 --> 07:37.004
When I asked him
what he was talking about...

07:37.215 --> 07:40.082
...he said, "Oh, I thought
we were talking about sex."

07:40.285 --> 07:41.343
But you weren't?

07:41.553 --> 07:45.353
No, of course not. I was coming in
to do a gastroplasty.

07:47.426 --> 07:52.523
Did he ever give you any reason
for terminating your fellowship?

07:53.498 --> 07:57.161
I was led to believe that he didn't
have to give me a reason.

07:57.869 --> 08:00.997
But he didn't sponsor anyone else
and funding didn't stop?

08:01.206 --> 08:02.195
No.

08:02.474 --> 08:03.839
Why do you think he did it?

08:06.511 --> 08:09.412
Well, I suppose he could've
been punishing me.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.381
We went out to lunch once.

08:13.585 --> 08:16.850
He laid his heart on his sleeve,
said he found me attractive...

08:17.055 --> 08:20.718
...and asked if we might go out
together on a date.

08:21.326 --> 08:24.386
And how long after that
did the fellowship end?

08:25.430 --> 08:27.091
A matter of weeks.

08:27.566 --> 08:30.364
We don't know for sure
if the two are related, do we?

08:30.569 --> 08:33.902
- That will be for others to decide.
- What others?

08:34.272 --> 08:36.706
If a full investigation goes forward.

08:36.908 --> 08:39.433
- How will that be determined?
- Dr. Weaver. Dr. Corday.

08:39.945 --> 08:41.879
I ordered up
a high-cholesterol breakfast.

08:42.080 --> 08:44.548
Three eggs, pigs in a blanket.
May I join you?

08:44.750 --> 08:49.312
- Unfortunately, we just finished.
- Drains to pull, that sort of thing.

08:49.521 --> 08:52.752
Well, then I guess I'll have
to administer CPR on myself.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.255
Doctors.

08:59.798 --> 09:02.596
I've been sitting for three days.
I'd rather walk.

09:02.801 --> 09:04.666
I'd rather you sit.
We're going in here.

09:04.870 --> 09:07.668
Carol, I got us a customer.
S.O.B. With a cough.

09:07.873 --> 09:11.639
- Who're you calling a son of a bitch?
- No, it means "shortness of breath."

09:11.843 --> 09:15.745
Okay. Let's get you seated
on the gurney, and take off this coat.

09:15.947 --> 09:17.312
No, it's cold in here.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.177
We promise to return your coat...

09:19.384 --> 09:22.319
- Just give me some medicine.
- You need to help us...

09:22.554 --> 09:24.545
Oh, Sparky. Get back up here.

09:25.824 --> 09:27.189
Animals aren't allowed.

09:27.392 --> 09:30.156
Give me some medicine
and I'll get out of your way.

09:31.263 --> 09:35.962
Why don't you let Malik take care
of Sparky while I examine you, okay?

09:36.168 --> 09:38.932
- Are you a dog person?
- Yeah, sure.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.007
- Okay. Any fever?
- Hey, Sparky.

09:43.475 --> 09:46.239
- Coughing up yellow or green sputum?
- No.

09:46.445 --> 09:49.346
All right.
This might be a little cold.

09:52.951 --> 09:55.249
I hear a few crackles.
I'd like a chest x-ray.

09:55.454 --> 09:57.445
Make sure you don't have pneumonia.

09:58.356 --> 10:00.381
- Alice, you're a smoker?
- Well, yeah.

10:00.592 --> 10:03.686
Breaks up the boredom on the road.
I drove from Albuquerque.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.992
- Why?
- I don't know.

10:06.198 --> 10:09.395
If I'd known it was this cold,
I'd have gone straight to Miami.

10:09.601 --> 10:11.193
How much is this x-ray?

10:11.403 --> 10:13.098
I don't have insurance or money.

10:13.305 --> 10:16.331
Alice, we're a county hospital.
If you can't pay, it's subsidized.

10:17.042 --> 10:20.239
Do you have any family in Chicago
you'd like us to call?

10:20.445 --> 10:21.844
Don't know a soul in Chicago.

10:22.047 --> 10:27.007
You stay here, keep an eye on Sparky,
and Malik and I will be right back.

10:27.519 --> 10:28.918
I'll order a portable x-ray.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.782
Good idea. Radiology won't
want to deal with Sparky.

10:31.990 --> 10:36.188
Carol, Medical Records just sent
these charts up for review.

10:36.394 --> 10:39.158
- We sent them last week.
- Then why'd they come back?

10:39.364 --> 10:42.390
Just like they said,
for review by the Interim Chief.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.193
That's you again, right?

10:44.936 --> 10:47.461
Thank you for straightening that out,
Malik.

10:47.672 --> 10:48.900
No problem.

10:51.476 --> 10:54.877
Richard Tuggle, 35. Complains of 20
minutes of heavy chest pain...

10:55.080 --> 10:56.479
...with nausea and diaphoresis.

10:56.681 --> 10:57.648
Felt okay this morning.

10:57.849 --> 11:00.579
- Coming through!
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.774
No problem.

11:03.588 --> 11:05.818
BP's 140/88. Pulse 90.

11:06.024 --> 11:08.754
Chest pain was relieved
by two sprays of nitro.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.327
CBC, Chem-20, cardiac enzymes.
Here, help him out of that.

11:12.531 --> 11:17.468
- Have you had pain like this before?
- Never.

11:17.669 --> 11:19.330
- Any history of heart disease?
- No.

11:19.538 --> 11:23.065
- High blood pressure? Diabetes?
- No. I'm really healthy.

11:23.275 --> 11:26.244
- When you're free, Doug's waiting.
- I'll be there soon.

11:26.444 --> 11:28.412
Pulse ox is 99 on two liters.

11:28.613 --> 11:32.515
- You weren't out shoveling snow?
- No. I work at home. Telemarketer.

11:33.151 --> 11:35.415
So, what is it?
Did I have a heart attack?

11:35.620 --> 11:37.952
Well, you're a little young for that.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.488
We'll do some blood work
and monitor your heart.

11:40.692 --> 11:42.023
We'll figure it out.

11:42.661 --> 11:46.893
- I hear an ejection murmur.
- I hope not.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.395
Carter?

11:50.302 --> 11:51.929
- What are you doing?
- Dr. Anspaugh.

11:52.137 --> 11:54.970
Meet Dudzik, Hilzig and Strauss.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.970
Second-years. Patient/doctor class.

11:57.776 --> 11:58.868
Need something?

11:59.077 --> 12:01.875
I was hoping you could give me
some time. But...

12:02.847 --> 12:05.873
Never mind.
Where's your student? Miss IKnight?

12:06.418 --> 12:09.046
- Surgery rotation.
- Right.

12:09.754 --> 12:10.880
Never mind.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.059
You don't want coffee?

12:17.262 --> 12:19.890
No, I'm not having any trouble
staying awake.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.589
Okay.

12:23.602 --> 12:24.660
What's the verdict?

12:26.771 --> 12:27.897
No big verdict.

12:28.106 --> 12:32.042
We agreed to keep this quiet so that
we don't jeopardize hospital funding.

12:32.243 --> 12:35.735
But Mark and I want some assurance
this won't happen again.

12:35.947 --> 12:39.508
So anytime you want to prescribe
schedule-two narcotics:

12:39.718 --> 12:44.621
Morphine, Demerol, Dilaudid, Fentanyl,
we want to cosign the order.

12:48.293 --> 12:50.625
- That's it?
- That's it.

12:51.963 --> 12:55.592
Okay. Well, if it'll settle
things down, I'll agree to do it.

13:01.272 --> 13:03.797
Believe me or not, I don't
have some...

13:04.009 --> 13:06.273
...compulsion for breaking the rules.

13:06.645 --> 13:08.613
Sometimes they get in the way
of helping a patient.

13:08.813 --> 13:12.840
If you'd seen the pain this kid was
in, you would've done the same thing.

13:13.852 --> 13:16.446
Doug, we have seen that kind of pain.

13:24.729 --> 13:26.856
Dr. Ross, Carol needs you
in Curtain 3.

13:27.065 --> 13:28.327
Thanks, Jerry.

13:47.052 --> 13:50.488
His contractures have been so severe.
Worse than anything with Michael.

13:50.689 --> 13:52.418
His seizures have increased.

13:52.624 --> 13:54.319
Joi, come sit.

13:54.526 --> 13:58.485
Dr. Julian wants to admit him.
But I just can't do that.

13:58.697 --> 14:01.393
- Roger Julian?
- He's a doctor up in Genetics.

14:01.599 --> 14:04.124
- I know him.
- Joi spoke to him this morning.

14:04.636 --> 14:08.629
Michael, my oldest, was in the ICU
his whole last week...

14:08.840 --> 14:10.933
...hooked up to all those tubes.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.503
I know Ricky doesn't have much time.

14:16.748 --> 14:19.444
But I just can't do that to him.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.747
- Can we keep Ricky here?
- Please, I just want to take him home.

14:23.955 --> 14:25.445
I'm gonna talk to Roger.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.285
But I think we should arrange
for PCA...

14:28.493 --> 14:30.222
...Patient-Controlled Analgesia.

14:30.895 --> 14:35.161
We would hook Ricky up to an IV that
would deliver pain medication at home.

14:35.366 --> 14:37.698
Now, obviously,
you'll have to control it.

14:38.236 --> 14:41.364
Will it be stronger medicine
than what you gave me before?

14:41.573 --> 14:43.336
Dilaudid or Fentanyl.

14:43.541 --> 14:48.035
Okay. I'll do whatever it takes, Dr.
Ross, just so I can keep him at home.

14:48.246 --> 14:52.580
I know he probably won't know
the difference, but you know.

14:52.784 --> 14:56.242
It's okay. We'll let you know
as soon as we can set it up. Okay?

15:02.527 --> 15:06.486
All right. I'll go find Roger.
You set up an IV.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.665
- All right?
- Yep.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.459
Getting near the end.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.840
If the survival rate's the same...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.339
...why not do a lumpectomy
and save the breast?

15:19.544 --> 15:22.775
Because with a modified radical
mastectomy you can save the patient.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.949
Although a lumpectomy can get
around the tumor.

15:25.150 --> 15:28.551
- And then you do radiation therapy.
- And there can be severe side effects.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.620
Yeah. There can be
with removing a breast.

15:31.823 --> 15:34.018
I'm not discounting
the psychological impact.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.489
Actually, I think you are just a bit.

15:36.694 --> 15:40.892
You'll see most male surgeons find it
relatively easy to lop off a breast.

15:41.099 --> 15:42.964
That's clich Á, don't you think?

15:43.168 --> 15:45.193
Yeah, because it's true.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.803
It's a personal decision
this woman must make.

15:48.006 --> 15:51.942
She's gonna worry about her sexuality,
her self-image.

15:52.477 --> 15:55.742
Listen, a patient comes in here with
cancer, I say we cut it out.

15:55.947 --> 16:00.748
See? You think of her in terms
of being a patient, not as a woman.

16:01.452 --> 16:04.944
You know what? It's not
that complicated. Let's forget it.

16:05.156 --> 16:09.456
You don't want it to be complicated.
Just cut to the chase, so to speak.

16:09.661 --> 16:12.061
Well, isn't this a scrub fest?

16:12.564 --> 16:15.226
Mind if I borrow your intern?
I gotta do an appy.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.834
No, not at all. I've only got
a biopsy. Lucy, you're with me.

16:19.070 --> 16:20.628
Thanks. Appreciate it.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.732
You need my assistance
on an appendectomy?

16:24.943 --> 16:28.106
Of course not, but I'd love
the company. How was breakfast?

16:28.880 --> 16:30.507
It was coffee, actually.

16:31.182 --> 16:33.343
Women never seem
to eat breakfast anymore.

16:33.551 --> 16:36.179
Now it's just coffee
or maybe a muffin. Why?

16:36.387 --> 16:41.381
Are they worried about their weight,
a reputation for eating like a horse.

16:41.593 --> 16:43.390
I really couldn't say.

16:43.595 --> 16:48.532
Can you say what people are talking
about with IKerry Weaver over coffee?

16:49.968 --> 16:52.664
You can stop playing games, Robert.
I know what's going on.

16:52.871 --> 16:54.771
I know someone's accused you.

16:54.973 --> 16:55.962
Falsely.

16:56.541 --> 17:01.478
But if IKerry digs and decides she's
determined to dig up something...

17:01.679 --> 17:03.943
...you know, that's how
people get hurt.

17:04.515 --> 17:06.039
Well, that's true.

17:06.284 --> 17:09.845
I mean, for instance,
what if it came out...

17:10.054 --> 17:14.718
...that you were sleeping with Peter
Benton while you were his intern...

17:14.925 --> 17:17.359
...and he was your supervisor
in a position to evaluate you...

17:17.561 --> 17:20.030
...which, I'm sure you're aware,
is a very big no-no.

17:20.932 --> 17:24.800
Come on. Peter and I were together
before I was his intern.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.493
And you made Anspaugh aware
of that, right?

17:28.606 --> 17:31.803
That's grounds for dismissal.
Not for you, of course.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.808
But for Peter, Dr. Benton,
which would be a shame...

17:35.013 --> 17:38.346
...considering how much work
he's put into getting where he is.

17:38.950 --> 17:40.417
You wouldn't dare.

17:41.953 --> 17:45.753
Well, I wouldn't like myself
very much if I did that, would I?

17:48.393 --> 17:51.829
Anyway, it's not really in my hands,
is it?

17:54.365 --> 17:57.061
The films are back on Alice Presley.
She's antsy to go.

17:57.268 --> 18:00.237
- I said I'd find meat for Sparky.
- Thanks, Malik.

18:00.605 --> 18:03.836
- Hey, Steve.
- Nurse Hathaway, always a pleasure.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.340
I've kept these up
so you can see for yourself.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.843
As you can see for yourself,
there is no evidence of pneumonia.

18:10.181 --> 18:15.050
There's a raise in bronchovesicular
markings which may be smoking induced.

18:15.253 --> 18:18.518
Although, it's more likely
she simply has the flu.

18:18.723 --> 18:20.918
Not unlike half the techs
in our department.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.259
What we have here is essentially
a normal chest film.

18:24.462 --> 18:26.259
I'd like a V/Q scan.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.956
What makes you think she has a PE?

18:29.167 --> 18:31.658
She's a smoker, hypoxic,
and been driving for 18 hours...

18:31.869 --> 18:33.860
...putting her at risk
for blood clots.

18:34.105 --> 18:36.801
- What's her heart rate?
- 85.

18:37.008 --> 18:38.441
- Respiratory rate?
- 20.

18:38.943 --> 18:41.503
- Any calf tenderness?
- Not really.

18:41.713 --> 18:43.977
Nothing you've said
suggests pulmonary embolism.

18:44.182 --> 18:46.241
She has pleuritic chest pain.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.883
So does everyone with bronchitis.

18:49.654 --> 18:53.146
Look, I know there isn't any hard
evidence. It's just a feeling I have.

18:54.158 --> 18:58.925
Unfortunately, I cannot authorize
an $800 test based on intuition.

18:59.130 --> 19:03.658
The patient has a cough
and no insurance, I might add.

19:04.168 --> 19:06.295
So that's what this is about?
Payment?

19:06.838 --> 19:10.001
No. Although, the hospital does
like to cover its expenses.

19:12.377 --> 19:13.810
I'll pay for it.

19:16.247 --> 19:19.774
- Your checkbook is my command.
- Thanks, Steve.

19:19.984 --> 19:23.579
One V/Q scan coming up.

19:24.022 --> 19:26.991
We got a couple more hackers.
I'll stick them into Exam 2.

19:27.191 --> 19:29.182
No, no. It's not ready yet.

19:29.394 --> 19:31.919
- Yes, it is. Your patient left.
- Alice Presley?

19:32.130 --> 19:34.792
Is she nuts? She talked
about walking her Sparky.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.091
Oh, God!

19:36.300 --> 19:40.532
I promised Anspaugh I'd review charts
for him. Am I a sucker or what?

19:41.072 --> 19:43.131
Hey, you don't have to agree with me.

19:43.341 --> 19:47.300
- Hey, you okay?
- Yes. It's slippery. I'm fine.

19:47.512 --> 19:48.809
Good luck, Mark.

19:49.747 --> 19:50.873
How's he doing?

19:51.082 --> 19:55.212
- Pain-free, normal sinus, no ectopy.
- Which is all good, right?

19:55.420 --> 19:57.854
Yes, but I got some
of your blood work back.

19:58.056 --> 20:02.049
And I'm concerned
because your cholesterol is 465.

20:02.260 --> 20:04.160
- That doesn't sound good.
- It's not.

20:04.362 --> 20:06.762
Do you have a family history
of high cholesterol?

20:06.964 --> 20:11.526
Did your father or any male relative
have heart trouble in their 30s?

20:12.036 --> 20:13.025
I don't know.

20:13.237 --> 20:15.831
Some inherited conditions run
in families...

20:16.040 --> 20:17.871
...and can cause high lipid levels.

20:18.276 --> 20:19.743
So you might want to check...

20:19.944 --> 20:24.176
...because they can put you at risk
for a heart attack at an early age.

20:24.382 --> 20:26.043
I can't check. I was adopted.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.242
I haven't a clue
about any medical history.

20:29.454 --> 20:33.049
I'd like to admit you so we can start
you on a cholesterol-Iowering agent...

20:33.257 --> 20:35.225
...and do a complete workup.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.558
Alice! Wait! Wait! You need
to stay for one more test.

20:42.767 --> 20:44.291
I really can't. Miami calls.

20:44.502 --> 20:46.629
You don't want to get stuck
on the road sick.

20:46.838 --> 20:49.238
You don't understand. I can't
leave the pups in the cold.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.431
You can bring Sparky in.
I won't tell.

20:51.642 --> 20:55.043
No, you really don't understand.
It's not just Sparky.

20:58.216 --> 21:02.152
I didn't start out to collect them
or anything. It just happened.

21:03.121 --> 21:04.816
Jules, we did our Residencies
together.

21:05.022 --> 21:08.287
The old school tie won't work.
I hated my Residency.

21:08.493 --> 21:10.393
There you go. So did I.

21:10.628 --> 21:13.620
Ricky can't control his analgesia,
but the mother's willing to.

21:13.831 --> 21:17.358
Up in Genetics we prefer
to admit these end-stage kids.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.229
We're not experienced in home care.

21:19.437 --> 21:22.565
We do it with cancer kids.
They send them home.

21:22.773 --> 21:24.263
Maybe Oncology can help you.

21:24.475 --> 21:27.239
I don't have time. This kid's
in bad shape, he needs it.

21:27.812 --> 21:31.111
- Doug, look...
- Jules, come on.

21:32.783 --> 21:34.751
I'll talk to the team about it.

21:34.952 --> 21:38.581
- We meet the day after tomorrow.
- Ricky doesn't have until then.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.247
I'm sorry.

21:44.162 --> 21:47.529
- Ouch. You're poking too hard.
- Strauss, stop your whining.

21:47.732 --> 21:51.793
These are the anterior chains
and these are the...

21:52.470 --> 21:55.303
...posterior. As you examine,
ask yourself:

21:55.506 --> 22:00.170
"Do the nodes feel like BB's,
like peas or sourballs?"

22:00.378 --> 22:03.347
- I got two BB's.
- I got one BB and one sourball.

22:03.548 --> 22:04.640
Quit goofing.

22:04.882 --> 22:07.180
It doesn't feel like a BB.
It's not a pea.

22:07.385 --> 22:10.149
It can be tough to estimate
the size at first.

22:14.992 --> 22:16.084
BB and a pea, right?

22:20.364 --> 22:24.391
You had any night sweats?
Any weight loss?

22:24.602 --> 22:26.092
Jeez, what is this?

22:26.304 --> 22:29.102
- Have you?
- No, I feel fine.

22:29.507 --> 22:32.670
- Noticed enlarged nodes elsewhere?
- You're kidding, right?

22:33.211 --> 22:34.200
No. Nothing.

22:34.745 --> 22:36.713
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

22:36.914 --> 22:38.814
I might get another doctor to look.

22:39.784 --> 22:42.412
- Maybe do a biopsy.
- A biopsy?

22:50.795 --> 22:53.730
I'm Mark Greene.
I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

22:53.931 --> 22:56.661
Mobalage. Mobalage Ekabo.

22:57.201 --> 23:00.193
You've done something to your back.
Let me take a look.

23:00.404 --> 23:04.636
No, it's been like this
for a long time. I'm all right.

23:04.875 --> 23:07.309
It might be a slipped disc.
Let me take a look.

23:09.814 --> 23:10.872
Come on.

23:15.186 --> 23:18.212
It won't take long.
Sit down right here.

23:41.846 --> 23:43.370
Did you start here recently?

23:45.883 --> 23:47.180
It's been several months.

23:48.886 --> 23:53.186
Really? I haven't seen you
around much.

23:55.793 --> 23:57.761
I worked on other floors.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.265
Well, glad to have you down here.

24:06.070 --> 24:07.059
Thank you.

24:07.305 --> 24:09.136
I closed the curtain for privacy.

24:18.549 --> 24:19.516
Okay.

24:22.820 --> 24:24.412
You can take your shirt off now.

24:25.256 --> 24:27.918
No, please. Stop, please.

24:30.628 --> 24:32.425
Stop it, please.

24:32.630 --> 24:34.029
No. Stop!

24:34.231 --> 24:37.029
- I'm not doing anything.
- Stop it now!

24:37.468 --> 24:38.833
- Stop it!
- It's okay.

24:39.036 --> 24:40.162
- Stop it!
- It's okay.

24:40.638 --> 24:42.765
Stop it! All right?!

24:53.484 --> 24:54.781
Malik, need help?

24:54.985 --> 24:56.953
No, I'm cool. I'm just going in here.

24:59.090 --> 25:00.079
How'd you do?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.987
It's all good.
I hope they like Cheese Sliders.

25:03.194 --> 25:05.094
- We ain't breaking the rules?
- No.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.958
Sneaking dogs in
and feeding them cheeseburgers...

25:08.165 --> 25:12.101
Did you say cheeseburgers?
That's their favorite.

25:12.303 --> 25:13.565
Shut the door!

25:14.171 --> 25:15.229
Please don't ask.

25:15.439 --> 25:17.270
I need to talk to you outside.

25:17.475 --> 25:19.773
Yeah. Malik, you okay in here?

25:19.977 --> 25:22.605
Oh, he's doing great.
The pups love him.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.542
All right. I'll be right back.

25:24.749 --> 25:28.150
And after they eat, that's usually
when they need to go outside.

25:28.352 --> 25:30.013
Make a little poop.

25:32.423 --> 25:35.483
Genetics bailed. We can't
get a PCA for a couple of days.

25:35.693 --> 25:40.357
Maybe I can arrange it through the
clinic, call a home health care agency.

25:41.799 --> 25:44.632
Jerry, did you find out
about that guy Mobalage?

25:44.835 --> 25:46.894
No. Housekeeping hasn't
called back yet.

25:47.104 --> 25:48.366
What happened?

25:48.572 --> 25:50.597
He flipped out.
I hadn't started the exam.

25:50.808 --> 25:52.105
You know, Rachel called.

25:52.309 --> 25:55.437
She said she's going
with the purple frames.

25:55.646 --> 25:58.672
Poor Rachel. She found out
that she needs glasses.

25:58.883 --> 26:00.646
She couldn't see the blackboard.

26:00.851 --> 26:04.184
I hated when that happened.
I felt like such an 8-year-old geek.

26:04.388 --> 26:07.050
It happened to me at 9.
Same age as Rachel.

26:07.258 --> 26:09.988
Fiercely bad eyesight
on my side of the family.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.389
You must've had fiercely red hair
on your side.

26:12.596 --> 26:13.585
Yep.

26:13.798 --> 26:16.790
I hope that's the worst thing
I pass on from my gene pool.

26:17.001 --> 26:18.798
It's not like she'll go bald...

26:19.003 --> 26:22.404
Jerry, weren't you gonna check
those labs for Mrs. Bolpec?

26:22.973 --> 26:24.941
Yes, I was. I am.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.474
You owe her, Jerry.
Where's Carter?

26:28.679 --> 26:30.044
Suture.

26:31.449 --> 26:32.438
ER.

26:33.517 --> 26:35.075
Malik, where are you?

26:37.688 --> 26:39.519
I'll help you in a few minutes.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.087
I got it. On my second call.

26:45.296 --> 26:49.630
One of the agencies I used with PCA
on a cancer patient a few months ago.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.995
Joi's health insurance will cover it.

26:52.203 --> 26:53.795
Did you tell her about it?

26:54.004 --> 26:55.699
No, I think you should.

26:55.906 --> 27:00.866
Joi, looks like we're able to provide
that pain medication we talked about.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.136
Now? Today?

27:02.346 --> 27:05.782
A home health care agency will
deliver the machine to your house.

27:05.983 --> 27:11.046
The machine will be set to deliver
an amount of Dilaudid every hour.

27:11.255 --> 27:15.214
- When do I push the button?
- Whenever you feel he's in pain.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.122
- How do I know how much to give?
- You won't have to worry.

27:18.329 --> 27:21.230
There's only one booster dose
within a two-hour period.

27:21.432 --> 27:25.493
Then the machine will automatically
lock out any additional dose.

27:25.703 --> 27:29.969
Dr. Ross will write a prescription.
A medi-van will take you home.

27:30.174 --> 27:32.870
Thank you. Thank you both so much.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.678
I just wish we could do more.

27:43.087 --> 27:47.114
- It started snowing again!
- Yeah, about an hour ago.

27:47.725 --> 27:49.989
Listen, IKerry, I've been thinking.

27:50.194 --> 27:53.425
I don't feel comfortable
with what I told you.

27:53.631 --> 27:56.361
None of us are at ease
with the situation.

27:56.567 --> 28:00.936
What I mean to say is, I don't feel
there was any harassment involved.

28:01.138 --> 28:04.733
That's not our decision. When the
full committee hears the testimony...

28:04.942 --> 28:06.341
I won't be testifying.

28:07.011 --> 28:12.074
If I'm not convinced, then I shouldn't
put it forth into an official record.

28:12.917 --> 28:14.544
Did something happen today?

28:14.919 --> 28:18.878
No. There's just no relevance
to the incidents I mentioned.

28:19.523 --> 28:23.755
That being the case, I think it's only
right that I withdraw my statement.

28:23.961 --> 28:26.589
I'm really sorry.
Sorry that I wasted your time.

28:27.197 --> 28:28.687
I hope you understand.

28:40.344 --> 28:42.312
- Ready to go in here?
- Yep.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.743
Labs are all okay.

28:44.949 --> 28:48.112
Upon physical exam, no significant
findings in the head or neck...

28:48.319 --> 28:52.085
...other than the enlarged node
in the right submaxillary area.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.916
You want to do the honors, Carter?

28:54.992 --> 28:56.983
I've actually never done
a neck biopsy.

28:57.394 --> 29:00.090
Okay, well, here's your chance.

29:00.297 --> 29:03.630
- You ready there, Mr. Strauss?
- Yeah. Okay.

29:04.201 --> 29:06.829
So this V/Q thing was positive?

29:07.037 --> 29:10.700
Yes. Which means that small blood
clots have traveled from your legs.

29:10.908 --> 29:14.742
If this isn't treated, a larger
blood clot could lodge in your lung.

29:15.679 --> 29:19.240
That sounds bad. I'll have to get
myself back soon to get that treated.

29:19.450 --> 29:21.680
Alice, you need to be admitted today.

29:21.885 --> 29:25.514
You need to stay for a few days
so your blood can be anticoagulated.

29:25.723 --> 29:26.985
My dogs. I can't...

29:27.191 --> 29:30.957
I don't know what we're gonna do,
but we'll think of something.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.962
- Jerry!
- Damn it, Jerry!

29:34.164 --> 29:35.324
Go! Go!

29:35.599 --> 29:38.625
- Go get them, Jerry!
- You gotta get them.

29:39.603 --> 29:40.592
Oh, God!

29:47.578 --> 29:51.639
Hey, Mark? Ricky Abbott,
the kid with ALD.

29:51.849 --> 29:53.441
He's back and in pretty bad shape.

29:53.651 --> 29:57.849
I arranged a home PCA. I need you
to sign off on the Dilaudid.

29:58.055 --> 29:59.579
He's a Genetics patient, right?

29:59.790 --> 30:02.054
- He's down here now.
- I can't sign off on that.

30:02.259 --> 30:04.887
- He's not on our service.
- I thought it'd be easier.

30:05.696 --> 30:08.187
Yeah, maybe. But that's their deal.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.867
You'll have to have Genetics
sign off on it.

30:11.068 --> 30:14.333
I should have thought of that
in the first place, huh?

30:22.246 --> 30:24.339
- Hey.
- Hey, did you have a breakout?

30:24.548 --> 30:26.015
Yeah, something like that.

30:28.952 --> 30:32.444
- Hey, you're on. All set.
- Okay, thanks.

30:32.656 --> 30:35.386
I'll give it to her
after I get rid of this guy.

30:41.165 --> 30:43.190
- Jerry?
- Sorry, Dr. Greene.

30:50.574 --> 30:53.805
Hi. I was looking for you.

30:57.181 --> 31:01.618
I am very sorry.
I can pay for the curtain.

31:01.819 --> 31:04.913
I don't care about the curtain.
Are you okay?

31:05.889 --> 31:09.017
I won't cause any trouble,
and I'd like to keep my job.

31:09.226 --> 31:12.559
You didn't cause any trouble,
and no one's gonna take your job.

31:15.365 --> 31:16.764
Thank you very much.

31:18.035 --> 31:20.595
I do think that you have
a pain in your back.

31:20.804 --> 31:22.738
I'd like to help you if I can.

31:22.940 --> 31:25.238
I think my back is fine.

31:27.478 --> 31:29.070
But there's something.

31:29.279 --> 31:31.338
I'm hoping you can give it to me.

31:31.548 --> 31:35.040
- What's that?
- I believe it's called Viagra.

31:36.587 --> 31:38.487
That's medication used for impotence.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.421
I am impotent.

31:49.633 --> 31:51.191
- IKerry?
- Robert.

31:51.401 --> 31:52.959
- May I sit down?
- Certainly.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.570
I'd offer you something,
but we don't have...

31:55.773 --> 31:57.604
Did you speak with Dr. Corday today?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.771
She assisted me on an appy.

32:00.978 --> 32:04.277
Is that when you spoke to her about
Maggie Doyle's harassment inquiry?

32:04.481 --> 32:07.314
- Why would I do that?
- To stop it from going forward.

32:07.518 --> 32:10.351
I'm eager for it to go ahead.
I look forward to being vindicated.

32:10.554 --> 32:13.318
Oh. Well, then you're gonna
be disappointed...

32:13.524 --> 32:15.958
...because the investigation's
been closed.

32:16.493 --> 32:17.482
Really?

32:18.629 --> 32:21.928
We'll have to go back
to our humdrum lives then, won't we?

32:22.499 --> 32:24.967
Of course, all the testimony
has been typed up.

32:25.435 --> 32:27.699
I've got it in a file.

32:33.377 --> 32:36.210
And the thing
that really sticks out...

32:36.413 --> 32:39.439
...is that bad evaluation
you gave Dr. Doyle.

32:39.817 --> 32:43.719
She's received such positive remarks
on her other rotations.

32:44.488 --> 32:47.685
You think that perhaps I was
a little bit hasty...

32:47.891 --> 32:50.553
...and that if I spent
a little more time on it...

32:50.761 --> 32:55.357
Yes. I'm thinking that if you took
that time right now...

32:55.566 --> 32:58.364
...you might write something
very different.

32:58.569 --> 33:00.560
Which you'd be interested in reading.

33:00.771 --> 33:05.003
Oh, absolutely. I imagine
I'd want to put it in that file.

33:09.146 --> 33:11.637
So, Mobalage, where are you from?

33:11.849 --> 33:13.111
Nigeria.

33:14.651 --> 33:16.881
That's a ways away from here.

33:18.055 --> 33:19.818
How do you like Chicago?

33:20.023 --> 33:21.183
Okay.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.555
My wife does not like the cold.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.061
She works here in the cafeteria.

33:26.263 --> 33:30.632
Well, that must be nice for both
of you. Watch my finger.

33:31.702 --> 33:34.136
To come to the same place for work.

33:36.673 --> 33:40.939
We need to pull the gown down now.
All right?

33:50.254 --> 33:53.519
The burns seem to be well-healed.

33:56.026 --> 33:58.551
Yes. They're not a problem.

34:02.766 --> 34:04.427
Had them for a while?

34:09.473 --> 34:11.907
- You want to tell me how it happened?
- No.

34:18.715 --> 34:20.978
I need to examine below the waist now.

34:21.851 --> 34:23.045
I understand.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.958
- You're in early.
- I have no life.

34:35.165 --> 34:37.463
Dr. Weaver, Sam Broder called back.

34:37.668 --> 34:40.136
- He'll meet you at Doc Magoo's.
- Thanks.

34:40.337 --> 34:43.601
- That sounds like a life. Hot date?
- At Doc Magoo's?

34:43.806 --> 34:47.004
- Even Dr. Weaver has standards.
- Thanks, Jerry. I think.

34:47.210 --> 34:51.543
Dr. Greene? Path report's back
on that med student, Strauss.

34:51.748 --> 34:54.774
- Better let him know.
- Sent that kid up to the O.R.

34:54.985 --> 34:56.577
- Hey, you have a minute?
- Yeah.

34:56.786 --> 35:00.655
I wanted to fill you in on something.
Let's go in the lounge.

35:00.857 --> 35:01.846
Sure.

35:07.130 --> 35:09.758
I need to talk to you
about the pathology report.

35:12.436 --> 35:15.997
- You guys mind hanging outside?
- No, they can stay.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.135
I already know it's crappy news.

35:19.843 --> 35:24.610
The biopsy shows Hodgkin's disease,
which is a form of lymphoma.

35:28.018 --> 35:29.144
Oh, man.

35:30.620 --> 35:32.588
Understand that it's very treatable...

35:33.056 --> 35:34.546
...with radiation therapy.

35:35.692 --> 35:38.092
Your chance of surviving is very high.

35:41.431 --> 35:45.458
Look, could I just...? Could
I have a few minutes here, please?

35:45.669 --> 35:48.695
Yeah. I'll check back.

35:54.778 --> 35:58.179
I contacted a pet rescue group
that can take the dogs tomorrow.

35:58.382 --> 36:00.282
I need you to take two home tonight.

36:00.484 --> 36:03.976
- I can't do that, Carol. I have cats.
- You have cats?

36:04.187 --> 36:06.348
Yeah, what's wrong with cats?
Sorry, Carol.

36:06.556 --> 36:07.989
Well, I'm a dog person.

36:08.191 --> 36:11.524
I'll take two and one of Jerry's.
I want the little one.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.856
No, no, no. Sparky is my man.
Hey, Sparky!

36:15.065 --> 36:16.191
I'll take two of the big ones.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.630
- AI's sick of little dogs.
- What's up with that?

36:18.835 --> 36:21.395
I'll take the Airedale
if no one wants him.

36:21.605 --> 36:23.300
Joi Abbott's on the phone for you.

36:23.507 --> 36:25.600
Work it out amongst yourselves.

36:25.809 --> 36:30.178
Give me two, any two. I don't care.
Tie their leashes to my locker.

36:30.380 --> 36:33.349
- Hey, Sparky.
- Thank you, guys.

36:38.288 --> 36:40.449
Hi, Joi. It's Carol Hathaway.

36:41.391 --> 36:44.383
Wait, wait. Joi, what's wrong?

36:46.296 --> 36:47.695
Did they hook it up?

36:47.898 --> 36:50.696
Can you tell if it's working properly?

36:52.035 --> 36:55.129
Joi? Joi.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.068
You need to calm down
and just take your time, all right?

36:58.275 --> 36:59.867
Just take your time.

37:00.844 --> 37:03.642
The initial lab tests don't reveal
anything like diabetes...

37:03.847 --> 37:06.543
...which may be related
to erectile dysfunction.

37:06.983 --> 37:07.972
I understand.

37:08.318 --> 37:11.446
You're not on any medications
that have that side effect?

37:11.655 --> 37:12.679
No.

37:13.457 --> 37:15.948
If it was psychological,
you could still have...

37:16.159 --> 37:19.526
...a spontaneous early-morning
or midsleep erection.

37:19.729 --> 37:21.788
No. I do not.

37:22.599 --> 37:25.090
I think it's caused by trauma.

37:27.137 --> 37:32.336
If you were in an accident
or maybe even beaten...

37:37.080 --> 37:38.775
If your pelvis had been broken...

37:38.982 --> 37:42.816
...internal bleeding could have
compressed the arteries and veins...

37:43.019 --> 37:46.182
...affecting the blood supply
to and from the penis.

37:49.826 --> 37:51.316
If that is the case?

37:52.195 --> 37:55.756
A urologist would probably want
to do a vascular bypass operation...

37:55.966 --> 37:58.059
...to try to restore normal function.

37:59.703 --> 38:01.762
I think you should see a urologist.

38:03.173 --> 38:04.162
Okay.

38:06.610 --> 38:09.477
- Where's Dr. Romano?
- I last saw him in the lounge.

38:24.494 --> 38:26.121
- Was it you?
- Sorry.

38:26.329 --> 38:28.729
There were a couple of names
I gave Dr. Weaver.

38:28.932 --> 38:32.891
One didn't have anything concrete
and the other backed out.

38:33.170 --> 38:34.762
Was that you, Elizabeth?

38:35.038 --> 38:38.769
Did you decide to protect
your own place in the food chain?

38:39.009 --> 38:40.408
Stay in the club?

38:41.077 --> 38:42.203
Yes, I did.

38:42.879 --> 38:46.007
- I'm sorry, Maggie.
- Sorry my ass.

38:49.586 --> 38:52.419
- Then they hooked it up wrong.
- It's hooked up right.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.954
She doesn't know whether
to give him a shot or not.

38:55.158 --> 38:57.217
- Lf she thinks he needs it.
- She can't tell.

38:57.427 --> 39:00.294
If in doubt,
she should give it to him.

39:00.497 --> 39:02.328
It's not gonna matter that much.

39:02.532 --> 39:05.000
I don't think he'll make it
through the night.

39:09.072 --> 39:10.369
I told her we'd go over.

39:12.609 --> 39:16.943
Why? She knows how to work
the machine. What are we gonna do?

39:17.147 --> 39:19.513
She's all alone, Doug.
She's really scared.

39:20.116 --> 39:22.380
I don't know
what good it'll do for us...

39:22.586 --> 39:25.350
...to be there watching her son die.

39:25.555 --> 39:28.524
I know. I don't know.
It probably won't do any good.

39:28.725 --> 39:31.193
I just...
I really want to be there.

39:36.800 --> 39:37.926
Okay.

39:40.070 --> 39:42.595
I'll probably be home pretty late.

39:53.617 --> 39:57.280
Mobalage, they told me you were here.
I didn't know what was wrong.

39:57.487 --> 40:00.820
IKobe, this is Dr. Greene.
Dr. Greene, this is my wife, IKobe.

40:01.424 --> 40:03.187
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do?

40:03.727 --> 40:07.663
I strained my back and Dr. Greene was
kind enough to take a look at it...

40:07.864 --> 40:11.061
...and give me some pain medication.

40:12.802 --> 40:15.270
Yeah, it'll be better
in a couple of days.

40:16.039 --> 40:17.097
Thank you.

40:17.307 --> 40:21.209
Sometimes he tries to do too much
at his job. He works too hard.

40:21.578 --> 40:22.567
Yes, I know.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.035
I'll be fine.

40:25.982 --> 40:27.040
Thank you again.

40:28.151 --> 40:29.140
You're welcome.

40:40.697 --> 40:44.428
You're the only man sitting alone.
I'm hoping you're Sam Broder, right?

40:44.634 --> 40:48.331
- Dr. Weaver. Nice to meet you.
- Call me IKerry.

40:49.706 --> 40:52.300
My office says you've made
a few appointments...

40:52.509 --> 40:54.875
...and always canceled them
at the last minute.

40:55.512 --> 40:57.605
- You'd think I was the dentist.
- I'm sorry.

40:57.814 --> 40:59.907
That's all right. It's pretty common.

41:00.116 --> 41:03.643
Deciding to track down your birth
parents isn't something to do lightly.

41:03.853 --> 41:07.345
- I've done that whole Internet thing.
- Most people start there.

41:07.557 --> 41:08.922
I do this for a living.

41:09.125 --> 41:12.390
My company handled several hundred
cases last year.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.356
Sounds like a good living.

41:16.266 --> 41:19.235
I need your full name,
date of birth, place of birth...

41:19.436 --> 41:21.836
...and the names
of your adoptive parents.

41:23.773 --> 41:26.037
I'm glad you could step in
on such short notice.

41:26.242 --> 41:28.301
I'm always happy to get
a 16-year-old up...

41:28.511 --> 41:31.605
...get him back out there kissing
the girls, making them cry.

41:32.349 --> 41:35.045
So how's this Interim Chief thing
working out?

41:35.251 --> 41:36.946
Oh, miserably.

41:37.153 --> 41:40.554
Between my surgical duties and all
the administrative crap down there...

41:40.757 --> 41:43.385
It's a shame IKerry Weaver
wasn't able to continue.

41:43.593 --> 41:45.288
Plus, you're Chief of Staff.

41:45.495 --> 41:48.692
I tackle that part of my job
around midnight.

41:48.898 --> 41:52.390
Didn't it work out well when
Morgenstern handled surgery in the ER?

41:52.602 --> 41:53.933
He did have it down.

41:54.137 --> 41:57.664
Well, Donald, I feel I'd be remiss
if I didn't offer up my services.

41:57.874 --> 41:59.535
To be Interim Chief of the ER?

41:59.743 --> 42:02.712
"Acting Chief" has a bit more
<i>je ne sais quois.</i>

42:02.912 --> 42:06.348
I don't care if you call yourself
God if you're willing to take that on.

42:06.549 --> 42:09.916
- We'd still be conducting a search.
- Yeah. Well, as long as you need me.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.314
I needed you today.

42:11.521 --> 42:15.150
- Well, how does tomorrow sound?
- Like a stroke of luck.

42:21.431 --> 42:24.525
Sorry it's only instant.
I used to grind the beans.

42:24.734 --> 42:27.202
Don't worry about it.
Anything is fine.

42:28.905 --> 42:29.894
I'll get it.

42:51.494 --> 42:52.483
Hi.

42:55.031 --> 42:56.020
