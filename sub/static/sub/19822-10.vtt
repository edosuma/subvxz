00:07.174 --> 00:10.542
(Eugene) Sneaking out in
the middle of the night...

00:10.644 --> 00:13.178
stealing a family heirloom,

00:13.280 --> 00:17.316
disobeying our direct orders.

00:17.418 --> 00:19.351
Did you really think you'd
get away with this?

00:19.453 --> 00:23.622
You impudent rabble.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.558
He's saying we're impertinent.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.593
(whispers) What?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.560

00:28.662 --> 00:30.362
He hates us, okay? Right.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.531
(Hedwig) And for the
most impudent of all,

00:32.633 --> 00:35.234

Is somebody hiding?

01:12.373 --> 01:13.338
Hm?

01:15.643 --> 01:17.309
Hm. Enough.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.979
Where is that miserable piece of filth?

01:21.082 --> 01:23.215
Don't look at me. He
never tells me anything.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.420
(gulps)

01:28.522 --> 01:30.556
You little one.

01:30.658 --> 01:34.059
Surely, you know where he is.

01:34.161 --> 01:38.630
I may have a piece of candy
if you tell me where he is.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.469
Sorry, were we supposed to watch Max?

01:43.571 --> 01:45.237
You didn't tell us.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.475
If you can wait just a few minutes,

01:49.577 --> 01:52.177
I'm sure we will find
the boy in no time.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.379

02:25.246 --> 02:28.180
And you're all grounded!
Get up to your bedrooms!

02:28.282 --> 02:31.250
(Eugene, through wall) Roll
call tomorrow, 5:00 a.m.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.219
so you won't forget who's
in charge in this house.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.155
Understood?

02:36.257 --> 02:38.423
I think it's a good thing.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.424
A good thing? Yeah.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.927
A good thing how?

02:42.029 --> 02:45.497
Who cares where the filthy urchin is?

02:45.599 --> 02:47.966
If he ran way, so much the better.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.402
We want all those brats
out of our hair.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.338
One down, four to go.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.573
That's true.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.176
And it's only a matter of time

02:57.278 --> 03:02.080
before we stick the other little
rats in new foster homes.

03:02.183 --> 03:05.517
Then this house and everything in it

03:05.619 --> 03:08.253
will belong to its rightful owners: us,

03:08.355 --> 03:10.189

Max?

03:24.438 --> 03:25.504
<i>We shouldn't talk on the phone.</i>

03:25.606 --> 03:27.506
It's too risky.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.508
We have to meet, okay? It's important.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.276
Text everyone and tell
them to meet in our room.

03:31.378 --> 03:34.112
Nobody's supposed to leave
their room until roll call.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.013
<i>Oh, big deal. Look, listen.</i>

The unit is down.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.191
(Tess) We need Internet
access for schoolwork.

gonna have a pillow fight.

03:49.697 --> 03:50.629
It's a game.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.431
We probably just need
to reset the router.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.067
I'm not a technological person.

03:58.105 --> 04:00.405
You monsters! What did you do?!

04:00.507 --> 04:04.977
We felt that all your devices
were too distracting.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.178
And so we've shut everything down.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.580
But...

04:08.682 --> 04:10.382
how did you take down
the phone network?

04:10.484 --> 04:11.516
You can't control that.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.853
Ever hear of a signal jammer?

04:14.955 --> 04:19.858
Of course you have. You're a smart boy.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.194
But just to be safe, we
will take your phones.

04:22.296 --> 04:28.533
Now.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.968

And just so we can keep

I'm here to help.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.111
Help how? Getting on my last nerve.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.080
Looking for the kids.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.748
I heard they disappeared.

13:03.850 --> 13:04.716
Oh, yes, the children.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.018
Yes, you must be worried sick.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.420
Oh, absolutely sick to my stomach.

13:09.523 --> 13:10.421
Right, me too.

13:10.524 --> 13:14.159
So, I... I thought,
don't just sit around.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.961
Do something instead of
twiddling your thumbs.

13:17.063 --> 13:17.829
And here I am.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.165
Well, what do you think you can do?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.567
There's no sign of the
poor little munchkins.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.469
We've looked everywhere.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.437
Well, maybe you did,
but on the other hand,

13:26.540 --> 13:27.572
I know those kids pretty well.

13:27.674 --> 13:32.477
I might know some places
you don't know to look.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.380
So... What are we waiting for?

13:35.482 --> 13:37.549
Yeah. They could be in danger.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.485
What about your brother?

13:40.587 --> 13:41.419
What about him?

13:41.521 --> 13:42.387
Well, uh, he can come too.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.723
That way we can cover more ground.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.792
Good idea. Yes.

13:47.894 --> 13:50.461
Eugene...

13:50.564 --> 13:51.362
Eugene.

13:51.464 --> 13:52.530
We're going to look for the children,

13:52.632 --> 13:54.432
so grab your jacket, come on.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.900
Yes. No dawdling.

13:56.002 --> 13:56.935
Quickly. We should go that way.

13:57.037 --> 13:57.936
This way, this way.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.672
Hurry up. Just continue, straight on.

14:00.774 --> 14:01.940
(Hedwig) Yes, yes, yes.

14:02.042 --> 14:04.008
Straight on. You can do it.
All right, all right.

14:09.749 --> 14:10.682
(lever clicks)

14:10.784 --> 14:11.716
(hinge squeaking)

14:11.818 --> 14:12.684
(dial clicking)

14:16.656 --> 14:17.088
We got everything.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.724
And we have food!

14:19.826 --> 14:21.025
(Anika) Yes! Yes.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.596
(talking over each other)

14:24.698 --> 14:25.630
I'm having withdrawal symptoms!

14:25.732 --> 14:27.098
And when there's no Internet,

14:27.200 --> 14:28.032
I start eating.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.934
(talking over each
other) We have a lot.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.136
Shh! (Sal) What?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.108
Anything on the missing juveniles?

14:37.210 --> 14:41.112
Keep me posted, Sierra 4-5 out.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.780
(Tim) They're gonna be okay.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.083
How do you know?

14:46.152 --> 14:49.787
They've been through so much.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.389
Poor Daniel.

14:51.491 --> 14:54.092
He's been taking care of all
of these kids by himself,

14:54.194 --> 14:54.993
but he's also just a kid.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.729
What?! No, I'm not!

14:57.831 --> 14:58.663
(all shushing)

14:58.765 --> 15:00.164
(Tim) Did you hear something?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.734
No. Come on, we should
check the hospital.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.938
(Sal) Nikka!

15:07.040 --> 15:09.741
Mine! You need to share!

15:09.843 --> 15:11.676
This is the tracking device.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.177
With this chip, you can
trace someone's location

15:13.280 --> 15:15.947
whenever and wherever you want.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.749
Whoa, can I connect it with Simone?

15:23.023 --> 15:26.624
Now... I'm connecting
this chip to this pouch.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.096
The diamond please.

15:35.869 --> 15:38.469
I'm just joking.

15:38.571 --> 15:38.903
I totally have it.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.972
Here you go.

15:43.877 --> 15:45.209
Okay.

15:48.782 --> 15:49.647
(sharp exhale)

15:49.749 --> 15:52.150
Now, we can trace this
diamond's location

15:52.252 --> 15:52.984
within 20 meters or less.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.119
Killing it, dude.

15:55.221 --> 15:55.987
But only if there's an
Internet connection.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.789
Did somebody say Internet?

15:57.891 --> 15:59.791
Can I? Can I?

15:59.893 --> 16:01.659
Nikka! Nikka!

16:01.761 --> 16:04.796
(distant chatter)

16:16.009 --> 16:17.842
You're Max?

16:17.944 --> 16:19.811
Yeah.

16:19.913 --> 16:21.679
You got a package for me?

16:21.781 --> 16:22.880
Where's your cape and hood?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.016
What? Your cape and your... your hood.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.617
Who rides a bike with a cape?

16:26.720 --> 16:27.185
Never mind.

16:27.287 --> 16:27.952
You got the package?

16:28.054 --> 16:29.854
Right. Right.

16:33.693 --> 16:33.725
Here.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.497
All right.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.832
Wait, that's... that's it?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.735
You don't have, like,
like, uh, directions

16:43.837 --> 16:44.936
or message for me or something.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.404
Oh, right.

16:46.506 --> 16:46.637
Thank you.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.577
What's this?

16:52.679 --> 16:54.212
For receipt.

16:56.549 --> 16:56.848
There you go.

16:56.950 --> 16:57.915
Thanks.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.584
Have a good one.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.054
(Max) Wait...

17:03.156 --> 17:04.922
Bicycle.

17:05.025 --> 17:05.990
Smart move.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.593
It's fast and maneuverable,

17:08.694 --> 17:09.961
the best way to beat traffic.

17:10.063 --> 17:13.431
You sound like a commercial
for Amsterdam Tourist Bureau.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.198
It might be the best
way to beat traffic,

17:14.300 --> 17:17.402
but it's not the only way.

17:17.503 --> 17:18.836
(Tess) Sal, hurry up.

17:22.976 --> 17:23.340
Where are we on the map?

17:23.443 --> 17:25.276
Around here.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.612
Do you have any idea
which route he's taking?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.847
(Daniel) Yes, I see him! Yeah!?

17:29.949 --> 17:30.415
Where?

17:30.517 --> 17:32.083
(Sal) There he is.

17:32.185 --> 17:32.984
You gotta go faster. Can
you go faster, Daniel?

17:33.086 --> 17:35.186
Aye aye, Captain.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.921
(motor accelerating)

17:38.158 --> 17:39.957
(Tess) He's right there!

17:40.060 --> 17:43.761
Oh, wait, he's coming this way.
He's coming this way.

17:43.863 --> 17:44.128
Wait, he's on the map. He's right here.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.963
Yeah.

17:46.066 --> 17:48.166
We're literally here, where is he?

17:48.268 --> 17:49.801
There he is, come on! (Sal) Go, go!

17:49.903 --> 17:50.868
We got him now.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.336
(Sal) We're gonna lose him.

17:54.307 --> 17:57.075
Guess what? The Hunters have a boat.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.810
And it's missing.

17:58.912 --> 17:59.844
You think the kids took it?

17:59.946 --> 18:02.880
Either that or it's a
pretty big coincidence.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.049
All units this is Sierra 4-5,

18:05.151 --> 18:06.984
be on the look-out for a party boat

18:07.087 --> 18:09.087
named Kate II.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.123
Possibly on board, four missing
juveniles and one almost adult.

18:12.225 --> 18:16.127
<i>I repeat, four missing juveniles
and one almost adult.</i>

18:16.229 --> 18:16.994
Almost adult?!

18:17.097 --> 18:19.831
Where is he?

18:19.933 --> 18:20.231
I don't know.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.900
(beeping)

18:23.002 --> 18:24.168
See him anywhere?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.069
It's going towards the bridge.

18:25.171 --> 18:27.004
Oh, yes! I see him.

18:27.107 --> 18:27.605
I see him!

18:27.707 --> 18:29.941
You do? You do?

18:30.043 --> 18:30.842
He's going right there.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.611
Turn right, he went right.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.879
No, he went left.

18:34.981 --> 18:35.847
No, he went right.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.148
Left? Right? Guys, guys, which way?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.783
Just go starboard.

18:38.885 --> 18:39.750
Star board?

18:39.853 --> 18:40.885
Star... Just go right.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.120
Starboard... Go right. Right.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.121
All right, I'm going right.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.623
(Sal) He's right there.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.892
So, now we have to go that way.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.060
What are you doing?!

18:49.162 --> 18:50.161
Go back to the helm!

18:53.500 --> 18:54.932
He should be right here.

19:02.242 --> 19:05.209
♪♪

19:10.350 --> 19:11.749
Guys!

19:19.893 --> 19:21.359
It's empty.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.994
Saginesh was onto us.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.962
(sirens approaching)

19:28.368 --> 19:31.002
Great, they were onto us too.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.215
Oh, thank goodness.

19:44.317 --> 19:47.118
Oh, my precious nieces and nephews.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.953
We missed you so much.

19:49.055 --> 19:51.656
(Eugene) Yes, we've been
looking all over town for you.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.124
That's how worried we were.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.960
Frankly, I don't understand how
you could let this happen.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.296
These children were left in your care.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.897
It's not our fault.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.099
They're like wild animals.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.168
We're old people. Yes.

20:04.270 --> 20:06.938
You can't expect us to
be chasing them around

20:07.040 --> 20:09.173
all the time.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.108
They're lying.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.043
The first thing they wanted
was to get rid of us.

20:12.145 --> 20:15.046
Uh! No... No...

20:15.148 --> 20:16.581
No.

20:16.683 --> 20:20.718
No. We love them like
they're our own children.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.453
Is that really the truth?

20:23.756 --> 20:24.789
(phone beeps)

20:24.891 --> 20:27.158
<i>I think it's a good thing.</i>

20:27.260 --> 20:28.226
<i>Good thing, how?</i>

20:28.328 --> 20:32.263
<i>Well, who cares where
the filthy urchin is?</i>

20:32.365 --> 20:35.099
<i>If he ran away, so much the better.</i>

20:35.201 --> 20:38.102
<i>We want all those brats
out of our hair.</i>

20:38.204 --> 20:40.738
<i>One down, four to go.</i>

20:40.840 --> 20:41.973
You give that to me!

20:42.075 --> 20:44.875
<i>And it's only a matter of time</i>

20:44.978 --> 20:46.877
<i>before we stick the other little rats</i>

20:46.980 --> 20:49.013
<i>in new foster homes.</i>

20:49.115 --> 20:51.749
<i>Then this house and everything in it</i>

20:51.851 --> 20:54.885
<i>will belong to its rightful owners: us,</i>

20:54.988 --> 20:56.020
<i>the real Hunters.</i>

20:56.122 --> 20:58.856
You little...

20:58.958 --> 20:59.890
Monster.

20:59.993 --> 21:02.627
So, I guess this house
will never be yours.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.928
Come on, let's go.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.029
It's not our fault. No, it was his...

21:05.131 --> 21:08.032
See ya! Bye!

21:08.134 --> 21:09.967
(Anika) I'm going to miss you so much.

21:10.069 --> 21:10.668
(Daniel) So am I.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.903
(talking over each other)

21:13.006 --> 21:15.706
Bye!

21:15.808 --> 21:17.008
(tablet beeping)

21:17.110 --> 21:18.276
(Daniel) The door's over here, come on.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.111
On the streets with you.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.245
(door closes)

21:21.347 --> 21:24.348
(beeping continues)

21:36.863 --> 21:38.329
Guys! Come here, quick!
