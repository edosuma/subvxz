Most ships would have been
blown to scrap

12:43.840 --> 12:44.990
after that kind of beating.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.113
Yeah, well, not the <i>Roci.</i>

12:48.800 --> 12:50.154
I'm actually
impressed as hell

12:50.240 --> 12:51.833
you were able to
make it back here.

12:52.440 --> 12:55.433
You're a Martian, right?
You still got people there?

12:57.720 --> 13:00.110
- I don't know.
- You didn't reach out?

13:00.640 --> 13:02.074
After Deimos, I mean.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.793
They think I'm dead.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.318
That I went down
on the <i>Donnager.</i>

13:12.240 --> 13:13.560
Died a hero.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.872
So is the <i>Roci</i>
gonna be okay, or what?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.632
Don't worry, we're gonna
treat her like one of our own.

13:24.920 --> 13:28.834
In the meantime,
you look like you could blow off some steam.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.197
I see you're
from some rock,

13:31.680 --> 13:33.114
care to put
the ball to the wall?

13:33.920 --> 13:35.513
<i>Pashang,</i> yeah! (CHUCKLES)

13:36.920 --> 13:38.639
FRED: The station
was lightly garrisoned,

13:38.720 --> 13:40.632
and my soldiers were
more trigger happy

13:40.720 --> 13:41.915
than I would've liked.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.395
Those are the survivors.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.751
Mostly low level tech
and security types,

13:45.840 --> 13:47.957
with the exception
of that one.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.400
He was in the data center.

13:50.600 --> 13:52.353
So we're going to
interrogate him first.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.991
He has to know more
about the protomolecule

13:55.080 --> 13:56.116
than anyone else.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.913
Not more than Dresden.

13:58.760 --> 14:01.400
We got ID scans
for the whole lot of them.

14:01.480 --> 14:04.552
The last two years are
completely blank for everyone,

14:04.800 --> 14:06.029
but before that,

14:06.240 --> 14:08.630
they all worked for
the same company, Protogen.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.515
- Hey!
- FRED: It's an Earth-based biotech contractor

14:11.720 --> 14:13.313
with facilities
throughout the system.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.596
Including the one
destroyed on Phoebe.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.960
Get in there!

14:23.960 --> 14:25.599
OPA GUARD:
Against the wall. Now!

14:28.080 --> 14:30.276
This should be
an interesting conversation.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.115
TRAVIS: Here, try this one.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.150
Crafty.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.720
Well, I thought
it'd be motivation.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.632
It's a loving re-creation.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.520
Are you
starting with me again?

14:44.600 --> 14:46.876
Take a compliment.
Texas looks perfect.

14:46.960 --> 14:48.314
It's your hometown, right?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.754
Your hometown's
only named after you

14:49.840 --> 14:51.240
because your family
infested it

14:51.320 --> 14:52.720
like some hyper-breeding rats.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.269
Well, we need more
real dust-eating Martians.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.555
Too many Earthers as it is.

14:56.640 --> 14:57.630
GUNNY: Hey.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.030
What?

15:00.440 --> 15:03.080
I see the way
you all look at me. Huh?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.633
Like I don't belong here.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.278
No one's questioning
your patriotism.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.874
Simmer down,
there, cowpoke.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.151
You know something,
I earned my iron, Hilly.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.993
Your family just bought
your way into the Corps.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.117
- That's enough.
- SA'ID: Settle down.

15:17.960 --> 15:18.950
Go fetch.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.199
GUNNY: Hey! Hey!

15:29.680 --> 15:30.875
God damn it.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.195
AMOS: <i>Have a seat.</i>

15:37.200 --> 15:38.680
FRED: Paolo Cortazar.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.436
You were a member
of a team studying Eros...

15:41.520 --> 15:44.752
I'm a specialist.
Nanoinformatics.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.077
- That sounds important.
- It is.

15:47.960 --> 15:51.032
We want to know
about the protomolecule.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.317
Then you should
talk to Dr. Dresden.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.438
- FRED: He's dead.
- What?

15:55.520 --> 15:57.113
He can't control you anymore.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.873
The project,
what about the project?

15:59.040 --> 16:00.554
You're going to
have to answer for it.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.712
The genocide on Eros.
Or, you can work with us.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.234
Are you taking up the project?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.874
We need you
to make a vaccine.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.713
Why would I want to do that?

16:14.240 --> 16:17.312
I understand you grew up
in Londrina, on Basic.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.550
That must've been hard.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.398
Only if you
can't find a way out.

16:21.720 --> 16:24.235
It's especially admirable
for you,

16:24.960 --> 16:26.633
after the loss of your mother.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.110
I can't imagine
what it must have been like,

16:30.680 --> 16:32.353
watching your mother die.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.351
Type-C Huntington's disease.
That's just so ungodly cruel.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.195
She never complained.

16:39.680 --> 16:43.230
Is that why you went to work for Protogen,
to find a cure?

16:44.760 --> 16:46.991
To keep others from going
through what she went through?

16:47.080 --> 16:49.436
Because I can't imagine

16:49.920 --> 16:52.719
a more noble endeavor.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.559
We can get you back there.
If you help us.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.118
Her brain was fried.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.069
She didn't think anything
was wrong with her.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.877
Even when the drool
was hanging from her lip

17:10.960 --> 17:13.794
for hours on end,
until it crusted to her chin,

17:14.440 --> 17:16.954
or she fell off the toilet
while taking a piss.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.759
She just kept going.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.877
Serene as the Buddha.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.115
So,

17:24.920 --> 17:27.388
not a bad way
to die, actually.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.752
It's different on Eros.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.400
There's real pain and death.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.355
You're free now,
to do the right thing.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.993
Dresden is gone.

17:45.080 --> 17:47.117
You don't have to
answer to him anymore.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.431
If he were here,
I'd thank him.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.795
He made me what I am today.

Use all the sensor data
from the actual raid

18:22.720 --> 18:24.439
to correct flight parameters.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.678
Now run the sim
from the beginning.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.591
Right. Nine degrees,

19:06.240 --> 19:10.154
It's just, I feel good.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.631
- It's been a while.
- Come on.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.360

19:15.280 --> 19:16.714
With some beers.

19:26.360 --> 19:28.397
Can you please
turn this shit off?

19:28.640 --> 19:31.314
This is the new banger,
fresh out of Eros!

19:31.640 --> 19:33.791
There's no music
coming out of Eros.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.440
We make it here,
but it come from there.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.756
What do you mean,
what are you talkin' about?

19:41.240 --> 19:42.674
The rock talking, <i>pampa.</i>

19:44.680 --> 19:45.909
It sing.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.596
Are you telling me that those
sounds are coming off Eros?

19:50.960 --> 19:52.792
Hottest beats-maker on Tycho.

you're jamming to

20:11.120 --> 20:12.793
are dead or dying.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.475
Or worse.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.351
That's why it's our anthem,

- Oh, yeah?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.390
You going to war now? Hmm?

20:23.680 --> 20:25.160
Everyone's goin' to war.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.478
Earth, Mars, Belt.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.957
You'll never even know
what you were fighting for.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.150
You kill that guy.
What you fighting for?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.875
(SIGHS)

20:37.760 --> 20:39.558
I cut off one head.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.754
Plenty more
where he came from.

20:42.160 --> 20:45.232
So we cut off all the heads.
Rule the whole system.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.392
The system rules you, kid.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.430
Always has.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.711
Even more reason
I choose to fight.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.713
You don't choose anything.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.836
You're born into it, man.
One side or the other.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.355
You play it out.

When those Inners,
they figure out what's on Eros,

21:11.040 --> 21:13.157
they'll kill every last
one of us to get it.

temporo-parietal junction

22:55.600 --> 22:57.159
have been impeded.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.720
Faulty wiring?

22:58.800 --> 23:00.996
Oh, he wasn't born this way.
He was altered,

23:01.080 --> 23:03.959
probably transcranial
magnetic hyper stimulation.

23:04.240 --> 23:06.277
Part of his temporal lobe
has been effectively erased.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.350
Which part?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.113
DOCTOR: The part
that governs empathy.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.833
You can do that
with a magnet?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.036
I've only read about
the procedure.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.317
It's not that simple but
it's not complicated either.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.470
It's non-invasive.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.120
So someone waves a magnet at
the right side on my head,

23:18.200 --> 23:20.078
and suddenly I can watch
100,000 people

23:20.160 --> 23:21.753
die in agony
and not give a shit?

23:22.880 --> 23:25.270
I've checked the other prisoners,
it's been done to all of them.

23:25.360 --> 23:27.238
The security guards
on that station

23:27.320 --> 23:28.993
were armed with riot bullets.

23:29.080 --> 23:31.390
Probably to keep them
from murdering each other.

23:31.480 --> 23:33.073
DOCTOR: Well, he's not
a homicidal maniac,

23:33.160 --> 23:34.594
he just no longer has
the capacity

23:34.680 --> 23:36.399
to consider any life other
than his own meaningful.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.715

23:41.960 --> 23:43.280
I'm afraid not.

reach a guy like that?

23:50.040 --> 23:52.839
Can you tell me how Private Travis
ended up with a fractured orbital?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.593
Sir. Did you ask
Private Travis, sir?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.353
Don't give me that, Gunny.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.358
Are we going to just
keep eating shit from Earth

23:59.440 --> 24:00.874
or are we going to
take them out and end this?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.157
What does that have to do
with one of my sergeants

24:03.240 --> 24:04.435
assaulting a private?

24:05.160 --> 24:07.311
You can only get slapped
around for so long before

24:07.400 --> 24:08.629
it boils out
one way or another.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.997
I'm well aware of
Private Travis' background.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.436
And the shit that he gets
for being born on Earth.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.874
And if he'd been
willing to talk,

24:14.960 --> 24:16.280
you'd be thrown
in the brig right now.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.431
But he wasn't.
That's how Martian he is.

to the contrary,

he is one of the toughest

with Earth, the better.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.554
We're not going to Earth.

it would give me

25:30.320 --> 25:31.470
to see you arrested...

All you need to tell me
is that it can't be traced,

will get to him.

it to me and go.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.560
It was a wreck.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.831
All the screens and the lights
were smashed to pieces.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.280

that guy's head

28:22.360 --> 28:23.510

and you found a solution.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.116
No, in that hotel room,
there was madness.

28:31.600 --> 28:34.035

talk about raping little kids.

But if you show them
pictures of kids,

32:06.440 --> 32:08.159
You infected them

control the station,

32:24.440 --> 32:26.033
erased the data cores
and left.

one for our team, one for the sample.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.713

contamination concerns.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.792
He was right to be concerned.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.156

What did it do?

32:39.600 --> 32:42.069
- Killed everyone aboard.
- Obviously.

But then what?
And be specific. Please.

The protomolecule was frozen
around the reactor core.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.313
It was starving.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.160
Did you turn
the power back on?

- Were you there, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.640
It does something
different every time.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.519
The more biomass
you feed it,

33:25.640 --> 33:27.552
the faster it learns,
the more it changes.

33:27.760 --> 33:29.638
So you fed it Eros.

33:30.960 --> 33:33.475
A whole station.
A hundred thousand people.

33:34.080 --> 33:35.992
A hundred thousand
opportunities.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.350
We can only learn
by letting it learn.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.234
Can it be controlled?

33:41.320 --> 33:42.913
That's what we were
trying to do.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.599
Can you control it?

be sealed,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.389

answer that is dead.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.080
Eros isn't over yet.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.232
And I don't think
we can save it.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.595
But I do know we need
to do something.

38:57.880 --> 38:59.917
And I know
I can't do it without you.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.634
We'll do it together.

39:18.720 --> 39:19.710
(SIGHS)

39:32.960 --> 39:34.235
(DEVICE WHIRRING)

40:00.320 --> 40:02.437
I take it this means you know
where you want to go?

40:03.240 --> 40:04.310
Eros.

40:05.200 --> 40:06.190
What?

40:06.520 --> 40:08.671
Something really bad
is going on down there...

40:08.880 --> 40:09.996
Yeah, we know.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.079
Then you know
we have to destroy it.

40:13.160 --> 40:14.150
(SIGHS)

40:14.560 --> 40:15.914
I think you're right.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.117
I know that you know

40:18.560 --> 40:20.950
that Dresden
was gonna get away with it.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.476
I didn't kill him
because he was crazy.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.596
I killed him because
he was making sense.

40:36.040 --> 40:38.475
Any idea how we can
take out a whole asteroid?

40:39.040 --> 40:40.235
Yeah.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.516
With that.
