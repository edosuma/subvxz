00:23.424 --> 00:25.393
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:25.426 --> 00:26.427
<i>Are you really ready</i>

00:26.460 --> 00:29.029
<i>for the academic rigors
of Stansfield?</i>

00:29.063 --> 00:30.231
<i>Yes, ma'am. I believe so.</i>

00:30.264 --> 00:32.433
Ezekiel Cross.
Have you heard of him?

00:32.466 --> 00:34.735
Zeke doesn't play,
you don't stay.

00:34.769 --> 00:36.704
This my boy Tariq.
Show him some love.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.672
<i>Your mom is Monet,
and your father is...</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:40.040
Lorenzo Tejada.

00:40.074 --> 00:41.175
<i>How many of you are there?</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:43.411
<i>Just the three of us.
It's me, Cane, and Dru.</i>

00:43.444 --> 00:44.745
<i>I don't know what's
gonna happen to your mom.</i>

00:44.779 --> 00:46.147
<i>She just fired me.</i>

00:46.180 --> 00:48.682
<i>Without me, Tariq, your mom
is in a lot of trouble.</i>

00:48.716 --> 00:51.085
<i>You're gonna need to get her
a good attorney fast--</i>

00:51.118 --> 00:52.553
someone who doesn't need
the truth to win.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.488
Davis MacLean,
my mother's on trial

00:54.522 --> 00:56.056
for killing my father,
and I want to hire you.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.691
Five hundred K, liquid,
up front.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.260
<i>We could make a killing here.</i>

00:59.293 --> 01:00.461
<i>All I need is a supplier.</i>

01:00.494 --> 01:02.530
How do we know who wants drugs
and who actually wants tutoring?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.799
See, the people that want drugs,
they'll order the premium package.

01:04.832 --> 01:06.434
<i>Each order will come
with a real study guide</i>

01:06.467 --> 01:07.501
<i>so we can cover our base.</i>

01:07.535 --> 01:10.337
You will be released
out of this shitshow

01:10.371 --> 01:12.106
and into
Federal Witness Protection.

01:12.139 --> 01:14.408
I need Witness Protection
for my whole family.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.510
So what are you gonna do now
that your illustrious career

01:16.544 --> 01:17.812
as U.S. attorney is over?

01:17.845 --> 01:18.846
Why do you care?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.514
Why don't you come work for me?

01:20.548 --> 01:23.083
Now that I'm out, I'm putting
my family back together.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.820
<i>Tommy just tried to kill me.</i>

01:25.853 --> 01:27.588
We got to get Yas
and get the hell out of here.

01:27.621 --> 01:30.524
I can get us some money, all right?
I just need a little bit of time.

01:30.558 --> 01:31.792
My number's in here.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.461
All right, if anything happens, use it.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.362
<i>Somebody tried
to kill me today.</i>

01:35.396 --> 01:36.530
<i>Tariq, are you okay?</i>

01:36.564 --> 01:38.098
<i>I'm good. I got away.</i>

01:38.132 --> 01:39.433
<i>Criminals don't attend our school.</i>

01:39.467 --> 01:41.635
The fact is that a gangbanger
was murdered

01:41.669 --> 01:44.271
by a killer skilled enough
to make it look like an accident.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.140
Zeke Cross.
Can I get a picture?

01:46.173 --> 01:48.609
Ooh!
- Aah!

01:48.642 --> 01:50.211
- What you need me to do?

01:50.244 --> 01:51.245
Body them Guaps.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.180
<i>Cane is out taking care
of G.T.G. right now.</i>

01:53.214 --> 01:54.448
<i>That'll be the last thing</i>

01:54.482 --> 01:55.850
<i>Cane does for this family.</i>

01:57.351 --> 01:58.419
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.354
Look, man,
I-I'll do whatever you need.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.455
I want half of everything.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.890
<i>Ma, I think that's Rico
with the drop.</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:04.825
- Get down!

02:04.859 --> 02:05.860
No, Dru!

02:05.893 --> 02:07.862
- Dru!

02:07.895 --> 02:10.331
Monet's right about you.
You are stupid.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.400
Cane, I told you
if you did something

02:13.434 --> 02:15.469
against the family,
I will put you down myself.

02:15.503 --> 02:16.770
Ramirez wasn't even fuckin' blood.

02:16.804 --> 02:17.805
Past tense?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.209
<i>I know you're involved, Tariq.
I know you've been selling drugs.</i>

02:22.243 --> 02:24.645
I'd like to use you
as basis for my next novel.

02:24.678 --> 02:28.516
- You want to write a book about me?
- I can get you money, Tariq.

02:28.549 --> 02:29.884
<i>Thanks for meeting me,
Professor Reynolds.</i>

02:29.917 --> 02:32.253
I'm sorry. I couldn't be seen
handing a bunch of money

02:32.286 --> 02:34.188
to a student on campus.

02:34.221 --> 02:35.422
I knew you was a snitch.

02:35.456 --> 02:36.624
We got to do something
about this nigga.

02:36.657 --> 02:37.691
He knows too much about us.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.493
Tariq, what the hell
you doing, man?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.795
<i>We use Ramirez's gun,
we tie up all the loose ends.</i>

02:41.829 --> 02:43.464
Can't let you write that book.

02:44.632 --> 02:45.866
<i>Y'all still planning to run?</i>

02:45.900 --> 02:48.235
<i>Ma's going.
You don't got to worry about her no more.</i>

02:48.269 --> 02:49.803
<i>'Riq. What took you so long?</i>

02:49.837 --> 02:52.273
We just got a tip
about another threat on your life.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.675
- We're moving you out now.
- No! Let me go.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.278
I should've popped Tasha
when I had the chance.

02:57.311 --> 03:00.214
Who the fuck's riding with you
that got the balls

03:00.247 --> 03:01.715
to pull a strap on me?

03:01.749 --> 03:03.350
So you really did
kill your father.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.319
He might not be here no more,

Yas, you got to be careful.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.713
Shit. Yas, you okay?

06:19.747 --> 06:21.582
How'd you know to do that?

06:21.615 --> 06:24.084
When I was your age,
Ma taught me and Raina.

06:24.118 --> 06:27.121
I'm so sorry, 'Riq.
I was trying to make breakfast.

06:27.154 --> 06:28.589
It's all right.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.591
You shouldn't be doing this
by yourself anyway.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.527
- What the hell?

06:33.560 --> 06:34.895
Wha--uh--

06:41.769 --> 06:43.070
Really, little girl?

06:43.103 --> 06:45.773
You... you had to wake up
the whole neighborhood?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.841
I'm sorry, Big Mama.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.543
- I mean, Grandma,

06:49.576 --> 06:51.044
I don't think
Yasmine is old enough

06:51.078 --> 06:52.980
to be making breakfast
for herself anyway.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.783
It's not just for her.
It's for both of us.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.186
I was cookin' when I was
her age, and so was your mama.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.191
Oh, Lord. You see?

07:04.424 --> 07:05.793
This one here don't listen.

07:05.826 --> 07:08.095
I done told her
a thousand damn times

07:08.128 --> 07:12.199
that I like my bacon crispy,
not burnt.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.535
What's so hard about that?

07:16.837 --> 07:18.672
When'd you get here, Tariq?

07:18.705 --> 07:20.707
I mean, you don't call first?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.509
<i>-You just show up?</i>
- Grandma, what do you mean?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.144
I been here since
eight o'clock last night.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.580
I spent the night.
You don't remember?

07:27.514 --> 07:28.549
Right. Yeah.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.184
Last night around eight.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.452
I spent the night.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.623
Yeah. Yeah.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.560
Look at all that snow.

07:41.195 --> 07:43.163
I'm going back to sleep.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.000
You take her to school.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.502
I got her.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.943
She been drinking again, Yas?

07:55.976 --> 07:59.680
She's getting worse, 'Riq.
Can't you stay here with us?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.217
- Ma?
- Get back in your room.

08:37.251 --> 08:38.585
If I'm not back
in five minutes,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.120
grab Dru and a piece
and climb out the window

08:40.153 --> 08:41.154
- and lock the door.
- Ma...

08:41.188 --> 08:42.656
Just do it!

09:02.609 --> 09:04.044
Shit, boy!

09:04.978 --> 09:06.780
You damn near gave me
a heart attack.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.782
Sorry.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.817
You okay?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.620
I needed water
for my antibiotics.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.623
Can you put your gun away?
I don't want to get shot again.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.194
- Dru, you okay?

09:21.228 --> 09:23.130
I wish people would stop
asking me that.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.065
The doctor said you got
to change those bandages

09:25.098 --> 09:26.934
every few hours.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.769
You need my help?

09:28.802 --> 09:30.304
Diana'll help me.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.573
Fine.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.209
Ma, you good? 'Cause I don't
know, you seem kind of--

09:36.243 --> 09:39.713
I'm fine. Just help your
brother clean up that mess.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.954
Look, it's not entirely
her fault you got shot.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.789
She feels bad, Dru.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.624
Not as bad as I do.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.269
That shit was lit.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.904
Hey, I bet you you and my pops

10:03.937 --> 10:05.605
ain't roll like that
back in the day, Mecca.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.641
Man, it was just another
Tuesday night for me, bruh.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.843
- Good to meet you, Cane.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.679
Hey, you said
you knew Big Guap?

10:12.713 --> 10:13.914
Shit, yeah.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.316
Yeah, we hit some licks
together back in the day.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.119
So you know my pops, Lorenzo--
they used to run together.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.021
Lorenzo? Tejada?

10:21.054 --> 10:24.691
Yeah. Yeah, I heard the name.
Never had the privilege.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.326
Where's he now?

10:26.360 --> 10:28.362
He's inside.
You ain't know that?

10:30.230 --> 10:32.933
Why do I get the feeling
you're testing me, bro? Huh?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.668
I mean, we just had
a good time in the spot--

10:34.701 --> 10:36.737
Fuck a good time.
You smell like a fuckin' narc.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.939
- What's up, motherfuckers?

10:40.073 --> 10:43.176
Yo, Javi, yo, you don't...
you don't want to do this, man.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.212
You a fuckin' traitor, LG!
And you ain't got no strap.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.880
So I definitely want
to do this.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.181
K.O. was my brother.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.916
Yeah, well, he shouldn't have
come for my family.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.885
K.O. was down for the G.T.G.,

10:51.918 --> 10:53.353
not like this piece of shit.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.188
What, you
a fuckin' Tejada now, LG?

10:55.222 --> 10:57.090
This is payback, bitches.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.359
Sorry you got the wrong
friends, motherfucker.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.238
Hey, yo, yo, yo, Mecca,
let him go, bro.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.706
He ain't coming back.

11:12.739 --> 11:15.242
Bro, chill! Chill, man, please.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.376
"Please"?

11:16.410 --> 11:18.245
Now you got manners,
motherfucker?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.315
Friends of yours?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.217
Nah. Not no more.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.154
- Cane, you know them?
- We had beef.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.423
Not anymore.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.926
Guess he ain't no narc.

11:32.959 --> 11:35.062
Guess not.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.067
<i>Coming up on</i> Matter of Fact,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.735
<i>my exclusive interview</i>

11:41.768 --> 11:44.771
<i>with superstar defense
attorney Davis MacLean.</i>

11:44.805 --> 11:46.073
<i>Don't go away.</i>

11:46.106 --> 11:48.842
<i>Stephanie,
let me get your opinion.</i>

11:48.875 --> 11:52.446
- How's this?
- Um...

11:52.479 --> 11:54.214
I think a jewel tone

11:54.247 --> 11:56.083
will really complement
your complexion.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.286
Yeah? Then by all means,
jewel tone me, quickly.

12:02.022 --> 12:05.725
Davis, good to see you.
Thanks for coming on the show.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.993
I know how busy you are.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.395
<i>Well, I'm never
too busy for you.</i>

12:08.428 --> 12:09.963
Oh. Sorry I'm late.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.365
Oh, Soledad, this is our newest
associate, Cooper Saxe.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.768
- From the U.S. Attorney's office.
That's right.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.236
You were on opposite sides

12:16.269 --> 12:18.839
of the Tasha St. Patrick
case, yes?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.907
Yes. You know
what they say, Soledad?

12:20.941 --> 12:23.243
- Opposites attract.
- Hell freezes over.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.279
I am very interested to see
how this team works out.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.115
- I will see you out there.
- All right.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.386
Whoa, associate?
You sold me on a partnership.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.956
Okay, look, we're partners,
all right?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.757
Both our names go on the door.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.860
MacLean and Associates.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.895
See, "Associates," that's you.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.798
- Wait. Why- why am I here?

12:44.831 --> 12:46.133
What, you need me
to hold your dick?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.968
No. Don't...

12:48.001 --> 12:50.137
if I play my cards right,

12:50.170 --> 12:51.872
<i>I might have someone
lined up for that.</i>

12:51.905 --> 12:53.206
Oh, my God.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.978
Uh, Stephanie,

12:58.011 --> 13:00.914
could you give us
the room a moment, please?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.986
Thank you.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.959
Tariq, my young brother,
what's up?

13:12.993 --> 13:15.095
Don't tell me
you're in trouble.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.796
Davis, just cut the bullshit,
a'ight?

13:16.830 --> 13:17.964
I need to find my mother.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.099
That's not

13:19.132 --> 13:20.834
how Witness Protection
works, Tariq.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.235
<i>Listen,
I need to speak to her.</i>

13:22.269 --> 13:25.572
It's about my little sister.
I'll make it worth your while.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.407
I'll see what I can dig up.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.209
Get back to me ASAP.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.847
Could you believe this shit?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.016
He talks his mom
into going into WITSEC,

13:36.049 --> 13:38.084
and now he wants me to find her
so they can have a chat?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.420
Fuckin' nerves.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.855
Could you find her?

13:41.888 --> 13:44.157
Even if I could find her,

13:44.191 --> 13:46.593
I wouldn't tell you,
let alone him.

13:46.826 --> 13:50.230
Look, he... he already
killed one parent.

13:50.263 --> 13:52.098
Maybe now--I don't know--
he's gonna take out the other.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.968
Please, that boy
loves his mother.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.904
He wouldn't harm a strand
of hair on her weave.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.206
All right?

13:59.239 --> 14:01.908
Plus, I told him

14:01.942 --> 14:05.278
I'd see what I can dig up,
not find her.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.180
And we're gonna charge him

14:07.214 --> 14:10.150
for every second
we even think about it.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.619
Well, that's disgusting.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.154
Hmm.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.356
Welcome to the world
of private practice, my friend.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.358
One more time from the top.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.893
Last go.
Stay strong. Stay strong.

14:19.926 --> 14:22.162
All right, E. Let's go.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.363
Come on. Let's go.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.432
Counterattack, here we go.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.567
Finish strong. Nice!

14:27.601 --> 14:29.236
Nice.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.238
Looking good, man.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.872
You think I'm ready?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.242
You know you got it.
Just got to keep grinding.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.246
How's your head?

14:39.279 --> 14:43.083
I missed a lot of games
'cause of academic suspension.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.318
Maybe another year
of college ball'd do me good,

14:45.352 --> 14:49.422
but I just ain't trying
to miss out on my opportunity.

14:49.456 --> 14:52.459
Look, you know your body,
you know your game.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.593
Even with the risk of injury,

14:53.627 --> 14:55.161
you don't want to come out
too early

14:55.195 --> 14:56.630
and fuck up a good career.

14:56.663 --> 14:59.165
You even want to come out now?

14:59.199 --> 15:01.101
Think about
what you want, Zeke.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.944
Bro! Where were you last night?

15:12.112 --> 15:13.480
Spent the night
at my grandmother's.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.248
You know, I was
with my little sister.

15:15.282 --> 15:16.549
Big family reunion, huh?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.618
Must be nice to have
your mom back.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.954
My mom's in Witness Protection
right now, bro.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.589
What? Why?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.958
<i>Are you okay with that?</i>

15:24.991 --> 15:26.293
I mean,
it's for her safety, bro,

15:26.326 --> 15:28.028
so I don't think
I have much of a choice.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.596
<i>Well, my family
hunting trip's this weekend.</i>

15:29.629 --> 15:31.197
<i>You know, come with.</i>

15:31.231 --> 15:33.166
Believe me, nothing will take
your mind off your troubles

15:33.199 --> 15:34.968
more than killing
a few helpless deer

15:35.001 --> 15:37.203
with a bunch
of uptight white people.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.438
I don't know
about that one, man.

15:38.471 --> 15:39.506
Okay, well, at least come

15:39.539 --> 15:41.241
to the kick-off dinner
in the city.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.509
It's a whole fuckin' thing.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.477
If you don't come,
it's gonna be all about me,

15:44.511 --> 15:46.479
my future, blah, blah, blah.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.250
Hold on. So this shit ain't
about me catching a break.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.353
This is about me deflecting
for your dumb ass.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.288
Yeah. Okay, yeah.
I'm not gonna lie.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.490
Can... can you just do
a brother a solid?

15:57.524 --> 15:58.558
I'll think about it.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.160
Yeah.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.461
All right. I'll hit ya later.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.496
- All right.
Ha ha!

16:13.106 --> 16:16.009
Riq, I heard your mom
got released!

16:16.042 --> 16:18.345
Um, why didn't you say
anything?

16:18.378 --> 16:19.546
Well, I just been
with the family

16:19.579 --> 16:21.081
ever since it all happened,
you know?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.683
No. Yeah, I- I totally
understand that.

16:23.717 --> 16:27.487
Um, I mean, I'd really
like to meet her.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.290
After all she's been through
and--it's pretty crazy.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.158
Where is Professor Reynolds?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.194
I have no idea.

16:34.227 --> 16:36.096
I haven't seen him.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.598
He was supposed to open up
the classroom this morning.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.066
Uh...

16:40.100 --> 16:41.601
<i>You've reached
Jabari Reynolds.</i>

16:41.634 --> 16:43.303
<i>-Leave a message.</i>

16:43.336 --> 16:46.039
Jabari, all the students
are here.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.074
It's the first day
of the ethics term.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.744
You need to be here.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.194
I'm not sure where
Professor Reynolds is,

17:08.228 --> 17:10.230
but let's get started.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.099
This seminar is centered
around your answers

17:13.133 --> 17:15.635
to the perennial
ethical dilemmas

17:15.668 --> 17:17.704
that scholars
have long debated.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.406
I'm so tired

17:19.439 --> 17:21.408
of the same old
patriarchal voices.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.276
Right, like, why are we worried

17:23.309 --> 17:25.278
about what old,
dead white men think?

17:25.311 --> 17:27.313
'Cause they still
run the world.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.515
Your world, maybe.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.316
There's only one world, sis,

17:30.350 --> 17:32.218
and we need to be
in this together.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.287
Call me "sis" again. Do it.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.456
Jackie, BruShaundria, come on.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.260
We've broken the larger group
into smaller sections

17:40.293 --> 17:42.695
so we can sharpen
your critical thinking,

17:42.729 --> 17:44.631
<i>hone your rhetorical skills.</i>

17:44.664 --> 17:47.200
<i>I want you to be
intellectually fearless</i>

17:47.233 --> 17:49.068
<i>as we attack these questions.</i>

17:49.102 --> 17:51.204
The only wrong answer
is the one you cannot defend.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.472
Understood?

17:52.505 --> 17:55.708
The first question
was Professor Reynolds' idea,

17:55.742 --> 17:58.378
but I'll press on
without him, I guess.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.381
It's a question that's been
around since biblical times.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.551
<i>Is free will an illusion?</i>

18:04.584 --> 18:09.122
<i>Do we make our own decisions,
or are they pre-ordained?</i>

18:09.155 --> 18:10.457
Ma.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.759
Oh, hell, no. Put that back.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.160
But I like it.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.596
I said what I said.
Put that shit back now.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.298
<i>What does it mean
if we're not making</i>

18:18.331 --> 18:19.632
<i>our own choices?</i>

18:19.666 --> 18:22.469
<i>-Who's making them for us?</i>
- Easy.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.305
<i>And who gives them
that power over us?</i>

18:28.241 --> 18:30.210
Is all this necessary?

18:31.511 --> 18:34.347
If you walk in a strip club
and all the girls

18:34.380 --> 18:39.152
are broke down,
wearin' last year's G-string...

18:39.185 --> 18:40.887
you sticking around
to pay their rent?

18:41.120 --> 18:43.456
I'm not convinced about this
whole stripper metaphor.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.825
Okay, fine. Look...

18:45.859 --> 18:48.661
in your old job,
you had to look...

18:48.695 --> 18:50.897
...trustworthy.

18:51.130 --> 18:55.835
In this job, you got
to look successful, smart.

18:55.869 --> 19:00.607
See, we take cases,
we win cases,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.775
and we look good
doing that shit.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.177
I make my own choices.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.311
You sure?

19:05.345 --> 19:08.147
Come on, your hair, nails,
your affect,

19:08.181 --> 19:09.749
that all comes
from where you come from.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.384
You didn't make those choices.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.852

19:23.530 --> 19:25.565
You got to have something
you care about, Davis,

19:25.598 --> 19:26.766
something of substance.

19:26.799 --> 19:29.435
Ain't no substance
like a bank balance, Saxe.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.738
Now, look...

19:31.771 --> 19:34.407
...public becomes clients
or the jury.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.244
You got to impress 'em both.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.180
Next, we got to work
on that hair.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.950
Sam Harris says
that thought and intention

19:44.183 --> 19:47.420
emerge from background causes
of which we are unaware

19:47.453 --> 19:49.889
and over which we have
no conscious control.

19:49.923 --> 19:51.457
My best friend got pregnant,

19:51.491 --> 19:53.726
and she's out here with just
her baby and a EBT card.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.430
I willfully chose

19:57.463 --> 19:59.232

<i>According to Nehru,

20:29.963 --> 20:32.398
The hand you're dealt
is determinism.

20:32.432 --> 20:35.268
How you play it is free will.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.470
We haven't heard
from you, Tariq.

20:37.503 --> 20:40.807
You agree with Lauren?
Do we have free will?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.445
Tariq, you don't have
to do this.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.779
You're wrong.

20:46.813 --> 20:48.915
I don't have a choice,
Professor.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.285
I mean...

20:52.318 --> 20:54.320
it doesn't feel
like that sometimes,

20:54.354 --> 20:56.990
but I like to believe
that we have free will, yes.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.258
- Who cares what you believe?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.393
What's your argument?

21:00.426 --> 21:02.328
So you think everything
is predetermined

21:02.362 --> 21:04.364
and you can't do anything
to change actions?

21:04.397 --> 21:06.466
- Yes.
<i>But I bet you look</i>

21:06.499 --> 21:08.301
left and right
before you cross the street.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.535
<i>Look, bro,</i>

21:09.569 --> 21:11.337
you can't base your conduct
off the belief

21:11.371 --> 21:12.805
that everything
is predetermined

21:12.839 --> 21:14.941
because you don't know
what's been predetermined.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.843
Stephen Hawking said that.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.878
Look, we all got to play
the hand that we're dealt.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.813
You got to deal
with the consequences.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.382
That's how life works.

21:24.917 --> 21:25.985
Pull over, D.

21:26.019 --> 21:27.920
I want to grab something
for Dru.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.790
Really?
We're carryng weight.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.426
Stay in the car.
I'll be back in a minute.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.881
What the fuck, Kamaal?

21:54.914 --> 21:56.716
What the fuck
is you on my couch,

21:56.749 --> 21:58.084
and I want to watch my TV.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.552
Come on.

21:59.585 --> 22:00.820
Look, I understand you upset

22:00.853 --> 22:01.988
that you lost
the governor's race,

22:02.021 --> 22:03.589
- but this ain't--
- I didn't lose.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.958
I was fuckin' robbed, bro.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.694
And nobody stopped the steal.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.028
That's no excuse for you

22:09.062 --> 22:12.031
to be lying around here
all day and night sulking.

22:12.065 --> 22:13.866
Come on, man, we Tates.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.003
You got to get back
on your feet.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.772
What's that thing
Pops used to say?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.908
Get me a drink and shut up?

22:21.941 --> 22:23.876
What? No!

22:23.910 --> 22:26.546
Listen, you still got
your councilman seat,

22:26.579 --> 22:28.481
and you still
represent the people.

22:28.514 --> 22:30.983
Oh. Fuck the people.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.619
What have the people ever done
for my Black ass? Hmm?

22:33.653 --> 22:34.987
I know you, 'Shad.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.990
The governor's office
was just a means to an end.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.760
What you really want
is the power.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.963
Okay. So you know me.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.600
So then find another means
or find another fuckin' couch.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.604
And clean this
fucking mess up, man.

22:51.637 --> 22:53.673
<i>Fucking pigsty.</i>

23:46.659 --> 23:48.961
What the hell
was all that about?

23:48.995 --> 23:50.463
They wanted me to move the car,

23:50.496 --> 23:52.565
but I handled it
just like you taught me.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.133
Smile a little, flirt a lot,

23:54.167 --> 23:56.135
make 'em feel like
they can get it.

23:58.004 --> 23:59.539
Proud of you, D.

24:01.007 --> 24:03.810
Stop all that damn cheesin' and
get us the hell out of here.

25:28.561 --> 25:31.130
My brother just texted me.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.200
-"We're here, dickhead."

25:35.568 --> 25:36.969
Ah, fuck.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.304
It's the fam, huh?

25:38.537 --> 25:39.705
Yep, that's them,

25:39.739 --> 25:41.908
waving a pair
of golden fuckin' handcuffs.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.910
Wait, yo, is that
a brand-new whip for you?

25:43.943 --> 25:45.211
<i>-Yep.
- You ain't tell me</i>

25:45.244 --> 25:47.113
the handcuffs came
with brand-new whip, nigga.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.048
- Sign me up.
- You don't get it, 'Riq.

25:49.081 --> 25:51.584
Yeah, I don't get it.
This shit is crazy.

25:51.617 --> 25:54.086
Isn't this nice?
That is for you, son.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.923
- Thanks, Dad.
- Congratulations.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.758
- Thanks.
- Why don't you go check it out?

25:58.791 --> 26:01.260
- Look at those rims, huh?
- Yeah, it looks great.

26:05.331 --> 26:06.866
<i>Every year this weekend</i>

26:06.899 --> 26:08.267
<i>becomes more important to me</i>

26:08.301 --> 26:11.203
because of the opportunity
to reflect on where we've been

26:11.237 --> 26:14.607
and where we're going
as a family

26:14.640 --> 26:15.942
<i>and a community.</i>

26:15.975 --> 26:19.211
And it gives us the opportunity
to kill Bambi's mom.

26:19.245 --> 26:20.846
- Shut up, Skids.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.115
And this year
is even more special

26:23.149 --> 26:25.651
because my old
college roommate,

26:25.685 --> 26:27.954
Congressman Rick Sweeney,
is here with us.

26:30.957 --> 26:32.658
I remember joining
your Weston weekends

26:32.692 --> 26:34.060
back when we were
at Stansfield, Bobby.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.995
- That's right. That's right.
<i>Well, I dug out</i>

26:36.028 --> 26:37.830
some of Bobby's old Stansfield
photo albums

26:37.863 --> 26:39.732
in your honor, Rick.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.634
Oh, I burned all my photos
from back then.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.736
- Well, he still won't tell me

26:43.769 --> 26:46.672
what happened on those secret
society trips out at the lodge.

26:46.706 --> 26:48.207
Hmm. Well, let's just say
I know

26:48.240 --> 26:49.642
where all the skeletons
are buried.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.043
Those secrets
die with us, Bobby.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.979
- They die with us.
- Cheers to that.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.981
Everyone, eat, drink,
and be merry.

26:55.014 --> 26:56.983
Thank you so much
for being here. Enjoy.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.818
Cheers.
- Great.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.220
Let's toast to all the misogyny
and rape committed

27:01.253 --> 27:03.222
by our marauding ancestors.

27:03.255 --> 27:06.158
Look at these photos
of Dad's frat house.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.861
You can practically
taste the roofies.

27:08.894 --> 27:11.364
Cheers to the good old days,
right?

27:21.040 --> 27:23.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh-uh.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.844
You, uh...

27:24.877 --> 27:26.345
you got to pledge Kappa
if you want to look at these.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.949
You shouldn't have brought
him here.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.984
Shut the fuck up, Trace.

27:33.052 --> 27:36.088
- Brayden.
- Uncle Rick.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.057
How's, uh,
your freshman year going?

27:38.090 --> 27:39.258
Uh, it's been good.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.826
You got to any, uh,
plans for the summer?

27:40.860 --> 27:43.262
Um, I was thinking about doing
something entrepreneurial,

27:43.295 --> 27:44.730
maybe sales.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.332
<i>Brayden will be spending the summer</i>

27:46.365 --> 27:48.667
at the family hedge fund,
just like Trace.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.270
And your friend, Terrell...

27:51.303 --> 27:54.273
- Tariq, Dad.
- Yes, Tariq. Tariq, uh...

27:54.306 --> 27:55.908
we have summer internships.

27:55.941 --> 27:58.277
I actually haven't thought
about any of that yet.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.745
Well, you should.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.214
Stansfield opens its doors
to students like you

28:02.248 --> 28:05.051
who might not have
traditionally matriculated,

28:05.084 --> 28:08.120
but they aren't given the...
the proper guidance to succeed.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.422
<i>Actually, Uncle Rick,</i>

28:09.455 --> 28:11.057
Tariq has been succeeding
pretty well

28:11.090 --> 28:12.792
in the Canonical Studies
program at Stansfield.

28:12.825 --> 28:14.060
You're familiar with it, right?

28:14.093 --> 28:16.996
Really?
That's a rigorous program.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.397
- Very. Very rigorous.
<i>It is.</i>

28:18.431 --> 28:20.900
I am happy to see
that Stansfield's

28:20.933 --> 28:23.302
need-blind admissions program
is succeeding

28:23.335 --> 28:26.472
in attracting top-notch
diverse students like you.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.107
Yeah, they are.

28:28.140 --> 28:31.477
But, actually, my education
is funded by my father's trust.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.847
Oh. And who's your dad?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.916
He's actually not here
with us anymore,

28:36.949 --> 28:38.818
but his name
was James St. Patrick.

28:38.851 --> 28:40.786
He ran for Lieutenant Governor.

28:40.820 --> 28:44.123
I met him once,
at a DNC fundraiser.

28:44.156 --> 28:47.059
It's... He was very impressive.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.794
Thank you.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.463
To lose your father
at that age,

28:50.496 --> 28:52.431
that's... that's tough.

28:52.465 --> 28:54.200
It is.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.235
And then the ugly rumors
that spread about him

28:56.268 --> 28:59.305
since his passing--
that doesn't help.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.440
I hope they're not true.

29:01.474 --> 29:03.742
I've witnessed firsthand
the deleterious effect of drugs

29:03.776 --> 29:04.844
on minority communities.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.378
I agree with you.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.881
I mean, look what opioids
are doing across the country,

29:08.914 --> 29:10.382
especially Appalachia.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.918
Of course, Big Pharma's
not getting put in prison

29:12.952 --> 29:14.019
for dealing Oxy.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.387
Son, there's a difference

29:15.421 --> 29:17.289
between legal
and illegal drugs.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.525
Legal drugs are killing people
at a higher rate

29:19.758 --> 29:21.427
than illegal drugs are.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.462
I mean, the only difference
that I see between the two

29:23.496 --> 29:24.897
is that rich white donors

29:24.930 --> 29:26.932
have the power to influence
these lawmakers

29:26.966 --> 29:29.869
so that their product
is considered "legal."

29:29.902 --> 29:32.138
- Hmm.
- Does have a point, Uncle Rick.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.206
You need to
bring him every year.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.244
Yeah, so how much money
are you taking

29:38.277 --> 29:40.479
from Big Pharma,
Congressman Sweeney?

29:52.191 --> 29:53.859
Thank you.

29:55.427 --> 29:57.129
Hey.

29:59.165 --> 30:00.833
Hey, Whitman, it's cold as fuck
out here, right?

30:00.866 --> 30:02.301
- No shit. Body's up the hill?
- Yeah.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.903
Hey, you got something for me?

30:03.936 --> 30:08.474
Snow didn't help, but I think
we found the murder weapon.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.809
That's a 15 Mag.
Is that police issue?

30:10.843 --> 30:12.178
Ran the serial number.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.846
Belonged to Detective Danilo Ramirez.

30:13.879 --> 30:15.447
- You reach out?
- Yep. He's not home.

30:15.481 --> 30:17.149
And he's missed a week of work.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.319
Huh. All right.
Did you put out a BOLO?

30:20.352 --> 30:22.821
Yeah. You think Ramirez
popped the victim

30:22.855 --> 30:24.256
and then skipped town?

30:24.290 --> 30:25.524
Maybe.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.827
But would he leave his gun here
for us to find?

30:28.861 --> 30:30.462
Look, that's good work,
but keep it quiet.

30:30.496 --> 30:32.431
Don't let the press find out.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.870
<i>How long has
the body been here?</i>

30:37.903 --> 30:40.206
Overnight, at least.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.877
Any ID?

30:56.355 --> 30:58.123
Shit.

30:58.157 --> 31:01.393
It's Professor Jabari Reynolds
from Stansfield.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.195
You know him?

31:03.229 --> 31:06.232
He was helping Santana
investigate a...

31:06.265 --> 31:08.867
dead body
found in the campus pool.

31:08.901 --> 31:11.036
Hope that didn't
get him killed.

31:29.488 --> 31:31.457
<i>Give it back to her.</i>

31:33.292 --> 31:35.294
Really, Tate? At my home?

31:35.327 --> 31:36.895
Okay. You have three minutes.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.264
That's all I need.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.399
I've been doing some serious
thinking about my next move.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.467
- Okay, just--

31:41.500 --> 31:43.102
Uh, Rachel, Lizzie,
Sarah, please!

31:43.135 --> 31:44.670
Daddy can't hear himself think.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.239
The truth is,
I wanted to have them.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.208
I mean, you can't have a career
in politics

31:49.241 --> 31:50.309
without kids, right?

31:50.342 --> 31:51.677
Would it have killed you
to give me a son?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.545
I mean, just one.

31:53.579 --> 31:55.581
Okay. You have two minutes
and 40 seconds left.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.583
The 12th District.
You see, the way I--

31:57.616 --> 31:59.018
Whoa, Sweeney's seat?

31:59.051 --> 32:01.086
You're interrupting
my precious family time

32:01.120 --> 32:02.488
to discuss Sweeney's seat?

32:02.521 --> 32:03.922
The guy's a Democratic legend.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.958
- No.
- He's a damn dinosaur.

32:05.991 --> 32:08.560
The district has grown,
diversified, and changed.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.296
- He hasn't, and you know it.
- Okay.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.398
Look, if you're asking for
my help or the party's help,

32:12.431 --> 32:15.234
I can tell you right now
the answer's a flat no.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.936
There's no way that guy's going
anywhere without some hard,

32:17.970 --> 32:21.640
and I'm talking, like,
hard dirt to force him out.

32:21.674 --> 32:24.543
So you just go back to
your little city council office

32:24.576 --> 32:27.012
and be happy you have a job.

32:27.046 --> 32:28.647
Seriously?

32:28.681 --> 32:31.150
Promise me, when I bring
something back on Sweeney,

32:31.183 --> 32:33.018
you'll bless
my taking his seat.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.554
Okay, yeah, sure. You got it.

32:35.587 --> 32:39.325
But that's never gonna happen.
Goodbye, Councilman.

32:47.433 --> 32:51.670
Hannah, listen, I'm sorry
I missed the meeting.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.440
But I promise,
I won't be slipping back

32:54.473 --> 32:57.343
into anything
with Zeke or Jabari.

32:57.376 --> 32:59.345
In fact, I just got a call
from the detective

32:59.378 --> 33:01.547
I used to work with and date.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.483
And, um, he wants
to meet for coffee.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.553
He's a good guy,
you know, an adult.

33:08.721 --> 33:11.390
And, um...

33:11.423 --> 33:14.193
we had chemistry, so...

33:14.226 --> 33:16.428
I know I wasn't making
good choices back then,

33:16.462 --> 33:19.531
but this could be like
a second chance, you know?

33:19.565 --> 33:23.602
Take it slow, of course,
but, um, I don't know,

33:23.635 --> 33:27.039
I feel like this could be the
beginning of something good.

33:29.074 --> 33:32.111
I got to go. Talk later.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.714
<i>-Kevin. Hey.</i>
- Hey.

33:35.748 --> 33:38.217
I, um, hope
you weren't waiting long.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.252
No, you...
you're right on time.

33:41.453 --> 33:42.755
You look great.

33:42.788 --> 33:44.723
Thanks. You too.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.194
Should we go inside?

33:49.228 --> 33:50.562
Uh, actually...

33:50.596 --> 33:52.631
I was hoping to maybe take you
someplace else.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.666
It's a couple blocks away.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.603
Okay. Sure.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.686
No.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.556
No.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.091
Oh, no.

34:19.124 --> 34:21.193
- Can you confirm his identity?

34:23.095 --> 34:25.097
It's Jabari.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.199
Jabari Reynolds.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.435
What happened to him?

34:35.140 --> 34:37.509
You two were close?

34:37.543 --> 34:39.678
We worked together.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.249
From your reaction,

34:44.283 --> 34:46.151
it feels like there might be
something more between you.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.719
In the past, there was.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.555
Not currently?

34:49.588 --> 34:53.358
- No.
- When did you see him last?

34:53.392 --> 34:56.128
I...

34:56.161 --> 34:58.130
I don't know.

34:58.163 --> 34:59.631
Yesterday in the office.

34:59.665 --> 35:02.301
What'd you talk about?

35:02.334 --> 35:05.737
I... I... I don't remember.

35:05.771 --> 35:08.273
Oh, Jabari.

35:08.307 --> 35:11.310
I'm so, so sorry.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.545
I'm so sorry.

35:13.579 --> 35:16.148
You're sorry?
You blame yourself for this?

35:18.150 --> 35:20.486
You think I had something
to do with this?

35:20.519 --> 35:22.488
I didn't say that.

35:22.521 --> 35:25.624
But it has been my experience
that you tend to blur

35:25.657 --> 35:28.494
the personal
and professional lines.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.829
That's why you ambushed me
this way.

35:30.863 --> 35:33.832
This is amateur-hour bullshit.

35:33.866 --> 35:36.502
I have no idea
what happened to Jabari.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.538
I would never, ever...

35:39.571 --> 35:41.907
I would never hurt him.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.842
You have any more questions
for me,

35:43.876 --> 35:45.444
you... you call my lawyer.

35:45.477 --> 35:48.514
Carrie, you can leave,
or you can help.

35:50.883 --> 35:53.318
I need a list of his students
and advisees

35:53.352 --> 35:54.853
and a separate list
of the students

35:54.887 --> 35:57.723
that you and Jabari questioned
about the G.T.G. kid

35:57.756 --> 35:59.358
in the Stansfield pool.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.360
You think
those murders are related?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.662
Can't be a coincidence
that kid dies,

36:03.695 --> 36:06.698
you and Jabari start asking
questions...

36:06.732 --> 36:07.799
now he's dead.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.372
I'll get you the lists.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.506
<i>Carrie.</i>

36:15.741 --> 36:16.909
What?

36:19.211 --> 36:20.445
Please be careful.

36:30.822 --> 36:33.525
Not only is my dad pressuring
me to pledge his frat,

36:33.559 --> 36:35.193
but now he's making calls

36:35.227 --> 36:36.662
so I get tapped to be
in the same secret society

36:36.695 --> 36:38.897
as every other frickin' Weston.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.899
Bro, are you even
listening to me?

36:40.933 --> 36:43.402
Yeah, basically your dad
wants you to be his mini-me.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.672
The car, the family
hunting trips, you know,

36:46.705 --> 36:49.908
i-it's all about hopping
on this Weston conveyor belt

36:49.942 --> 36:52.244
that I'm supposed
to just go along with

36:52.277 --> 36:53.812
with no regard to who I am

36:53.845 --> 36:56.582
or what I fucking
actually want.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.717
I mean, I don't blame you
for being upset.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.719
I don't want to be
my father either.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.455
That's why I like
selling product with you.

37:03.488 --> 37:07.492
It has nothing to do with being
a fucking Weston or who I am.

37:07.526 --> 37:08.594
You're not still thinking

37:08.627 --> 37:10.429
about getting out of the biz,
are you?

37:10.462 --> 37:12.664
I don't know, man.
Shit's crazy right now.

37:12.698 --> 37:14.700
- There's a lot going on.
<i>-Listen, 'Riq, I know</i>

37:14.733 --> 37:17.436
you've been through a lot,
but we built that shit.

37:18.737 --> 37:20.606
<i>I mean, we can't just go
and abandon it.</i>

37:28.981 --> 37:30.949
Holy fuck, bro.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.417
<i>What?</i>

37:32.451 --> 37:34.252
You know your professor,
Jabari Reynolds?

37:34.286 --> 37:36.555
Dude was shot.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.357
No way. What the fuck?

37:38.390 --> 37:40.459
I'm sorry, bro. He's dead.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.464
- One sec.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.714
Hey. Keep practicing.

38:02.748 --> 38:04.049
You'll get it.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.550
Thanks, Dru.

38:08.353 --> 38:10.455
I got a plan for us
to get out of the life.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.392
- Out the business?
- This about me getting shot?

38:13.425 --> 38:16.361
Yes, you getting shot.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.563
Diana was
almost arrested yesterday.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.299
I'm not risking
that shit again.

38:21.333 --> 38:24.369
A'ight, so what you want to do?

38:25.537 --> 38:27.706
I'm telling Zeke to sign up
for the draft this year.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.509
When he's really making money
on endorsements and shit

38:30.542 --> 38:33.512
in about three years,
we're out.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.013
He's our exit plan.

38:35.047 --> 38:37.015
Will Zeke be down with that?

38:37.049 --> 38:38.850
That nigga ain't got a choice.

38:38.884 --> 38:41.887
We follow him wherever he goes,
him and his team.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.357
Houston, Phoenix, whatever,
and we'll all have roles.

38:45.390 --> 38:47.793
I'll manage him,
Dru will travel with him,

38:47.826 --> 38:49.528
and you'll ward off
all the thots

38:49.561 --> 38:51.530
and be in charge of publicity.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.566
So we're all gonna be working
for Zeke?

38:54.599 --> 38:56.034
No, Zeke's our new product.

38:56.068 --> 38:58.336
He's your cousin.
It's about family.

39:01.606 --> 39:05.043
Stansfield professor
was murdered?

39:05.077 --> 39:06.478
Y'all know about this?

39:16.588 --> 39:18.924
Come on, Ma. Reach out.

39:27.399 --> 39:29.868
Lauren, what's up? You okay?

39:29.901 --> 39:32.938
I just can't stop thinking
about Professor Reynolds.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.875
- Where's Brayden?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.477
I don't know.
Probably somewhere in the hall,

39:38.510 --> 39:40.712
offering a girl a shoulder
to cry on or something.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.814
He's so chivalrous.

39:42.848 --> 39:46.685
Yeah. Any opportunity he gets.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.387
I just don't understand.

39:49.421 --> 39:51.590
Who would want
to kill our professor?

39:55.460 --> 39:58.930
Tariq, you don't
even seem upset.

39:58.964 --> 40:01.633
Lauren, my twin sister
was murdered.

40:03.135 --> 40:05.003
And your father.

40:05.036 --> 40:06.605
My mother's in WITSEC.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.039
You know,
over the past few years,

40:08.073 --> 40:09.641
I lost two of my best friends.

40:09.674 --> 40:13.178
I lost my godmother,
my godfather.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.114
And on top of everything,
I lost both of my parents.

40:17.749 --> 40:18.984
So, honestly,
I don't even think

40:19.017 --> 40:20.619
I have it in me
to cry for Professor Reynolds.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.720
I ain't even know him.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.723
I didn't know any of that--

40:24.756 --> 40:27.626
<i>about how many people
you've lost.</i>

40:28.927 --> 40:31.463
I can't imagine
how many times

40:31.496 --> 40:34.833
you've been through this
and much worse.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.704
You don't know
how I feel, Lauren.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.873
I want to know.

40:43.909 --> 40:46.178
I want you to tell me.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.762
Tariq?

41:03.795 --> 41:06.665
Lauren, I got to go.

41:06.698 --> 41:08.033
I got to be somewhere.

41:12.871 --> 41:15.040
Okay.

41:17.709 --> 41:20.478
I'll see you later.

41:26.551 --> 41:27.886
Hey, yo...

41:27.919 --> 41:31.122
why is this nigga's face
all over the fucking news?

41:31.156 --> 41:34.492
He's a respected professor
at an elite college.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.127
It was bound to happen.
I knew it would.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.029
Ain't nobody saying Ramirez
did him.

41:38.063 --> 41:40.065
That was your idea.
You fucked up.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.700
So why you think
we used his gun?

41:41.733 --> 41:43.168
Nobody gonna look into us
for that shit.

41:43.201 --> 41:44.703
They gonna have
to look into Ramirez.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.771
All right, motherfucker,
you better be right.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.540
I am. Don't worry about it.

41:56.248 --> 41:57.782
Shit.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.684
It's Monet.
She want to see me now.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.622
That Jabari nigga,
that was your professor, right?

42:04.956 --> 42:07.058
That's probably what
she want to talk about.

42:07.092 --> 42:09.561
Just act normal.
Don't say nothing.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.662
I don't know, man.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.163
You know, lyin' to Monet
is kind of risky.

42:12.197 --> 42:14.532
And tellin' her the truth
is fucking worse.

42:14.566 --> 42:15.767
And if I remember,

42:15.800 --> 42:17.135
you the one that said
she'll never find out.

42:17.168 --> 42:18.603
And she won't, a'ight?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.238
You the one bugging
the fuck out right now.

42:20.272 --> 42:22.540
Just chill, man.
I... I got this under control.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.809
I'm not going down for this.
Trust me.

42:24.843 --> 42:28.013
If both of us shut the fuck up
about it, neither of us will.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.814
Trust me.

42:51.636 --> 42:55.106
Heard about Professor Reynolds.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.876
Why haven't you been
answering my texts?

43:00.979 --> 43:02.948
You okay?

43:05.283 --> 43:07.285
No.

43:07.319 --> 43:10.121
I'm not okay.

43:10.155 --> 43:12.157
You know what happened?
Who shot him?

43:14.626 --> 43:16.661
Can you just hold me?

43:25.704 --> 43:28.807
<i>♪ I see pretty lights ♪</i>

43:28.840 --> 43:31.343
<i>♪ In the distance ♪</i>

43:31.376 --> 43:34.813

43:46.191 --> 43:47.292
What's up, Tariq?

43:47.325 --> 43:49.995
What up, Diana?

43:50.028 --> 43:51.629
Thanks, Dru.

43:51.663 --> 43:54.065
Thanks for coming, Tariq.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.836
Sit down. I cooked.

43:59.371 --> 44:00.705
Looks good.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.910
So tell me about this professor
that was killed.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.645
You know him?

44:07.679 --> 44:09.681
Yeah.

44:09.714 --> 44:11.182
Mr. Reynolds.

44:11.216 --> 44:13.985
He's one of my professors
in Canonical Studies.

44:14.019 --> 44:15.320
<i>You know,
he's a pretty good guy.</i>

44:15.353 --> 44:17.422
So it's definitely a tragedy.

44:17.655 --> 44:20.358
So what happened?

44:20.392 --> 44:22.694
I have no clue.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.763
You have no idea who shot him?

44:26.398 --> 44:29.334
Nah. Look, I know you guys
are probably concerned about,

44:29.367 --> 44:31.336
you know, police being all over
the campus and everything.

44:31.369 --> 44:34.672
But everything's fine.
You don't have to worry.

44:34.706 --> 44:37.675
You sure? 'Cause aren't
the cops still asking questions

44:37.709 --> 44:39.944
about that body
in the pool and now this?

44:39.978 --> 44:41.679
He was your professor.

44:41.713 --> 44:44.115
You sure no one will be looking
in your direction for this?

44:44.149 --> 44:45.850
Nobody.

44:45.884 --> 44:47.719
You sure you had nothing to do
with this man's murder?

44:47.752 --> 44:50.922
I had absolutely nothing
to do with it.

44:50.955 --> 44:52.157
<i>I swear.</i>

44:52.190 --> 44:54.726
Now, you know what happens
if you lying, right?

44:57.762 --> 44:59.831
I do.

44:59.864 --> 45:02.734
Good, because I don't need
my distro involved

45:02.767 --> 45:05.370
in some stupid shit that's
gonna put more eyes on us.

45:05.403 --> 45:07.906
Now, I just got a ton of brick
that needs to be moved.

45:07.939 --> 45:09.908
Can you do that?

45:09.941 --> 45:12.077
Of course I can.

45:12.110 --> 45:14.979
All right, then, let's eat.

45:23.154 --> 45:25.323
Hear anything from your mom?

45:25.356 --> 45:26.925
Nope.

45:26.958 --> 45:28.960
I wish I could speak to her.

45:28.993 --> 45:31.329
That ain't allowed, is it?

45:31.362 --> 45:33.331
Nope.

45:33.364 --> 45:35.300
But I don't care
about no rules.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.434
Yeah.

45:36.468 --> 45:38.970
I figured that out
about you already.

45:41.172 --> 45:43.341
Look, 'Riq, I know
I'm not your moms,

45:43.374 --> 45:46.311
but if you want to talk,
I'm here.

45:48.413 --> 45:50.448
And I really appreciate that.

45:50.482 --> 45:53.151
Thank you.

45:53.184 --> 45:54.853
I just feel like... I just--

45:54.886 --> 45:57.455
Diana, get in here
and get these plates.

45:57.489 --> 45:59.190
Um, I'm helping Tariq.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.792
He can handle it.

46:00.825 --> 46:02.327
Can't you, Tariq?

46:02.360 --> 46:03.962
Yes.

46:03.995 --> 46:05.964
Now!

46:07.832 --> 46:09.134
Sorry.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.802
Meet you later, okay?

46:10.835 --> 46:12.170
Yeah. Okay.

46:12.203 --> 46:15.406
<i>♪ 'Cause you've
always been mine ♪</i>

46:25.216 --> 46:29.821
<i>♪ You've always been mine ♪</i>

46:29.854 --> 46:33.525
<i>♪ Mine ♪</i>

46:33.558 --> 46:35.960
I do something wrong?

46:38.830 --> 46:40.198
I saw his body.

46:42.033 --> 46:43.568
What?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.336
At the morgue.

46:45.370 --> 46:47.872
I identified Jabari's body.

46:49.207 --> 46:52.010
And I can't get it
out of my head.

46:52.043 --> 46:54.345
You didn't answer me before.

46:54.379 --> 46:56.281
What happened?
How did he get shot?

46:56.314 --> 46:59.484
I don't know.

47:02.520 --> 47:06.191
Could the Tejadas have had
something to do with it?

47:06.224 --> 47:08.526
No.

47:08.560 --> 47:11.262
Why would you even say that?

47:11.296 --> 47:13.965
Monet threatened me
the other night.

47:13.998 --> 47:17.936
She told me that if I said
anything about what you told me

47:17.969 --> 47:19.370
about being attacked
by that gang,

47:19.404 --> 47:22.407
she would report me
for sleeping with you.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.876
Shit.

47:24.909 --> 47:27.879
- She knows about us?
- Yeah.

47:27.912 --> 47:29.547
And she knows that Jabari
was asking questions

47:29.581 --> 47:31.282
about that G.T.G. member
in the pool.

47:31.316 --> 47:33.918
<i>That doesn't mean that
she'd hurt Professor Reynolds.</i>

47:33.952 --> 47:38.256
Monet would never do anything
to jeopardize my future.

47:38.289 --> 47:41.993
<i>It's got to be something else.</i>

47:42.026 --> 47:43.261
Then what?

47:44.929 --> 47:48.266
What could Jabari
have done to get himself shot?

47:50.368 --> 47:52.136
Yo, pop the trunk.

47:54.606 --> 47:56.107
Did you go on a shopping spree?

47:56.140 --> 47:58.109
A little something-something.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.479
This shit's heavy as fuck.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.885
Jeez, what the fuck
is all this shit?

48:07.919 --> 48:09.387
It's weighing down
the Braymobile.

48:09.420 --> 48:12.056
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

48:16.494 --> 48:18.263
Back in
fucking business, baby.

48:18.296 --> 48:19.931
- Hell, yeah, dude!

48:19.964 --> 48:22.100
What made you change your mind?

48:22.133 --> 48:24.569
I mean, honestly, Bray, I don't
think I had a choice, bro.

48:24.602 --> 48:28.072
You think it's safe to move
with all this weight in my car?

48:28.106 --> 48:30.908
I mean, yeah, you're white.
Brand-new Benz. You'll be good.

48:30.942 --> 48:32.110
Okay, but white people

48:32.143 --> 48:33.544
still get pulled over
for speeding, 'Riq.

48:33.578 --> 48:35.046
Shit, once they pull you over,

48:35.079 --> 48:36.614
you give them your license,
they see you a Weston,

48:36.648 --> 48:38.383
they'll fucking apologize
for pulling you over.

48:38.416 --> 48:41.085
White privilege is just
another tool in our bag.

48:41.119 --> 48:43.254
- Why not use it?
- All right.

48:43.288 --> 48:45.323
Just keep the shit
under 65 on the highway

48:45.356 --> 48:46.691
- so they don't bother you.
<i>All right.</i>

48:46.924 --> 48:48.426
We'll park this
at my parent's country house

48:48.459 --> 48:50.461
until we figure out a plan
and move all this product.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.130
You're gonna
love hunting, 'Riq.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.132
I can tell.
You look like a hunter.

48:54.165 --> 48:56.100
You look like a fuckin' hunter.

48:59.671 --> 49:02.073
I'm glad you came, Cane.

49:02.106 --> 49:03.574
So what you want with me?

49:03.608 --> 49:06.978
Well, we got
some unfinished business.

49:07.011 --> 49:09.480
Follow me.

49:09.514 --> 49:12.550
I told you,
I hate rude motherfuckers.

49:12.583 --> 49:14.018
Oh, shit.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.687
Wait, that's the Guap
that got away.

49:15.720 --> 49:17.622
Uh-huh.
So I'm giving you a choice.

49:17.655 --> 49:20.158
- You can show him mercy.

49:20.191 --> 49:23.261
You could make him suffer...

49:23.294 --> 49:25.330
or...

49:25.363 --> 49:26.998
kill him.

49:27.031 --> 49:29.000
Say less.

49:34.739 --> 49:37.175
- Shut your ass up.

49:37.208 --> 49:39.410
Just know that whichever
you choose tells me

49:39.444 --> 49:41.312
exactly who the fuck
you are, man.

49:43.214 --> 49:45.516
See...

49:45.550 --> 49:47.552
I don't need any handouts.

49:50.288 --> 49:53.091
And I don't need him tied up
to beat his ass.

49:56.127 --> 49:58.629
Get your bitch ass up.

50:00.064 --> 50:02.400
Stupid motherfucker.

50:07.505 --> 50:10.608
Get up.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.722
<i>Come on, now.</i>

50:31.262 --> 50:33.765
I ain't got shit
to prove to you.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.603
But that's
who I motherfuckin' am.

50:40.772 --> 50:42.440
I see.

50:45.476 --> 50:48.045
You see Tariq tonight?

50:48.079 --> 50:50.047
You believe what he said
about that professor?

50:52.116 --> 50:54.585
Monet thinks she's smart
asking him like that,

50:54.619 --> 50:56.487
but no is the only real answer
he can give her,

50:56.521 --> 50:58.790
no matter what the truth is.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.691
Stupid waste of time.

51:00.725 --> 51:04.095
You ever gonna let up on Monet?

51:04.128 --> 51:06.264
She's part of the reason
I got shot.

51:06.297 --> 51:08.332
- She's trying to blame Cane,

51:08.366 --> 51:10.435
but I told her
that we needed him.

51:10.468 --> 51:12.203
Her pride
wouldn't let her hear it.

51:12.236 --> 51:14.405
Now she wants to act like
a mother and be all concerned.

51:14.439 --> 51:16.274
She should have been concerned
before this.

51:16.307 --> 51:17.742
She is concerned, Dru.

51:17.775 --> 51:19.410
She's just trying
to protect us.

51:19.444 --> 51:22.480
With what?
Her bullshit exit strategy?

51:22.513 --> 51:25.616
Without even asking us
how we feel about it.

51:25.650 --> 51:28.119
We ain't kids no more, D.

51:28.152 --> 51:29.587
We don't get a say?

51:31.522 --> 51:33.391
I mean, did you notice?

51:33.424 --> 51:35.626
She didn't even mention Dad
in that plan.

51:35.660 --> 51:37.862
So what, are we just gonna move
to wherever Zeke gets drafted

51:38.095 --> 51:39.597
and then, what,
leave him behind?

51:39.630 --> 51:41.466
That's not right, Dru.

51:41.499 --> 51:43.601
And why the hell do
I want to be Zeke's bitch?

51:43.634 --> 51:46.571
Like... like, who decided
that was gonna be my life?

51:47.772 --> 51:50.842
It would be nice to be able to
make some of our own decisions.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.111
Maybe we need to stop
waiting around for her

51:54.145 --> 51:55.513
to give us permission...

51:57.482 --> 51:59.584
...start making some moves
on our own.

52:22.406 --> 52:23.808
Shit.

52:35.520 --> 52:36.921
What the fuck you doing, man?

52:37.154 --> 52:38.789
Nothing, man.
I was just walking by--

52:38.823 --> 52:40.858
- It's cool.

52:40.892 --> 52:42.326
Okay? I ain't gonna say shit.

52:42.360 --> 52:44.328
You ain't gonna say shit?

52:44.362 --> 52:47.164
And what, I'm just supposed
to fuckin' trust you?

52:47.198 --> 52:48.900
Give me a reason

52:48.933 --> 52:50.935
why I shouldn't
dead your ass right now.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.804
You just seen my work, man.
And I can help.

52:53.838 --> 52:57.375
You? Help me?

52:57.408 --> 53:00.811
I see all this weight,
but I don't see any soldiers.

53:00.845 --> 53:03.548
Ain't nobody more vicious
or loyal than me.

53:03.581 --> 53:05.550
You're gonna have to show me
a whole lot more

53:05.583 --> 53:08.486
to convince me of that.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.221
All right.

53:10.254 --> 53:11.422
Give me a shot.

53:18.596 --> 53:21.699
Yo, I cannot believe
you got me out here, bro.

53:21.732 --> 53:23.768
I cannot believe I got you
out here either,

53:23.801 --> 53:25.770
but here we are.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.738
I mean, this shit
don't even make sense.

53:27.772 --> 53:29.774
What the hell
did the deer do to you?

53:29.807 --> 53:33.344
And after we kill the deer,
old dad forces us to eat it.

53:33.377 --> 53:35.446
So you have that
to look forward to.

53:35.479 --> 53:37.748
- You're a joy today, Becca.

53:37.782 --> 53:40.851
All right, everyone,
let's hit it.

53:43.888 --> 53:46.290
<i>♪ I, I got to get on a roll ♪</i>

53:46.324 --> 53:47.925
<i>♪ I got to stay on my toes ♪</i>

53:47.959 --> 53:49.660
Let's go.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.729
<i>♪ When you working
This hard, then it shows ♪</i>

53:51.762 --> 53:53.531
Hey, Zeke.

53:53.564 --> 53:54.765
Hey.

53:54.799 --> 53:56.934
Why I got to come
looking for you?

53:56.968 --> 53:58.369
You ain't get my texts?

53:58.402 --> 54:00.237
Did you threaten my professor?

54:00.271 --> 54:02.773
You mean that reckless-ass
professor bitch you fuckin'?

54:02.807 --> 54:04.609
Yeah, I told her
what time it is.

54:04.642 --> 54:06.344
You should've just stayed
away from her.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.546
I told you
she didn't know anything.

54:08.579 --> 54:09.947
Now Professor Reynolds is dead,

54:09.981 --> 54:11.582
and she asking more questions.

54:11.616 --> 54:14.285
They were both looking into
the Guap who got murdered.

54:14.318 --> 54:15.953
Please tell me you ain't had
nothin' to do

54:15.987 --> 54:17.655
with what happened
to Professor Reynolds.

54:17.688 --> 54:19.290
Zeke, I have no idea
what happened

54:19.323 --> 54:20.324
with that professor nigga.

54:20.358 --> 54:23.461
- That wasn't us.
- For real?

54:23.494 --> 54:24.996
- Don't lie to me.
- For real.

54:25.029 --> 54:26.464
Now, are you done?

54:26.497 --> 54:29.567
Because we have
more important shit to discuss.

54:29.600 --> 54:32.703
I need you to sign up
for the draft this year.

54:32.737 --> 54:34.505
It's time for you to go pro.

54:34.538 --> 54:37.475
Actually, I was thinking,
Auntie, I haven't been

54:37.508 --> 54:38.809
on the court much
'cause of my suspension--

54:38.843 --> 54:41.379
Look, we got to make this move
for the family now, Zeke.

54:41.412 --> 54:42.847
I just don't know
if it's gonna be the best--

54:42.880 --> 54:44.048
Well, I do.

54:44.281 --> 54:46.484
Enough of this Carrie shit.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.986
Enough of these distractions.

54:49.020 --> 54:51.856
Get your head in the game.

55:03.834 --> 55:06.003
Okay. Yeah.

55:06.037 --> 55:08.839
Smells like Irish Spring
and redemption.

55:08.873 --> 55:11.008
Quit it, nigga.
You ain't funny.

55:11.042 --> 55:13.344
Hey, listen,
I got myself an apartment.

55:13.377 --> 55:14.845
So I'll be out of here
by next week.

55:14.879 --> 55:16.714
Okay.
So was it something I said?

55:16.747 --> 55:18.349
Nope.

55:18.382 --> 55:20.518
I got a plan.

55:20.551 --> 55:22.019
I'm back in motion.

55:22.053 --> 55:23.854
And ain't nothin'
gonna stop Rashad Tate

55:23.888 --> 55:25.856
when he's got hisself a goal.

55:25.890 --> 55:27.758
- Okay. I'm proud of you, boy.
- Yes, sir.

55:27.792 --> 55:29.894
I am gonna need
something from you, though.

55:29.927 --> 55:32.530
And there it is.

55:32.563 --> 55:33.864
What you want, Rashad?

55:33.898 --> 55:36.534
I need you to log me
into the police database.

55:36.567 --> 55:39.603
I need to know everything there
is on Congressman Rick Sweeney.

55:39.637 --> 55:41.772
- Why Rick--
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

55:41.806 --> 55:44.041
Just log me in, please.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.087
So we just sit out here
and wait?

55:56.120 --> 55:57.988
Yep. Unfortunately.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.057
<i>This is actually fun to you?</i>

56:00.091 --> 56:03.394
Wait. Shh, shh, shh.
There's one right there.

56:03.427 --> 56:04.762
You see it?

56:04.795 --> 56:06.464
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

56:20.377 --> 56:23.848
He got her.
It's hit. Let's follow it.

56:28.786 --> 56:30.087
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

56:30.121 --> 56:32.757
What the fuck?

56:49.140 --> 56:51.041
Tariq.

56:51.075 --> 56:52.476
Tariq!

56:53.911 --> 56:56.480
<i>Tariq, are you okay?</i>

56:59.450 --> 57:01.619
You're lucky you
didn't hit him, Dick Cheney.

57:01.652 --> 57:02.920
<i>I know what I'm doing.</i>

57:02.953 --> 57:04.188
<i>I'm an excellent shot.</i>

57:04.421 --> 57:06.023
<i>You broke
every safety protocol--</i>

57:06.056 --> 57:07.992
<i>Calm down!
He wasn't in any danger.</i>

57:08.025 --> 57:09.960
<i>Sorry, Tariq.
That shouldn't have happened.</i>

57:09.994 --> 57:11.962
Let us make it up to you.

57:11.996 --> 57:14.465
You can take the kill shot.

57:14.498 --> 57:16.133
- What?
- It's an honor, son.

57:16.167 --> 57:19.036
<i>Seriously?
I never get the kill shot.</i>

57:20.538 --> 57:21.939
Let him go.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.007
<i>Do it, son.</i>

57:27.678 --> 57:28.879
There, it's done.

57:28.913 --> 57:31.148
- Everybody happy now?
All right.

57:31.182 --> 57:33.818
This is bullshit. I'm out.

57:33.851 --> 57:35.986
Tariq!

57:36.020 --> 57:37.621
Tariq, wait!

57:43.627 --> 57:44.962
Hey, hey, hey.

57:44.995 --> 57:49.834
Young bruh, I see
your stinkin' ass all up on TV.

57:49.867 --> 57:52.503
- You on the come-up, huh?
- Yeah, I look good, right?

57:52.536 --> 57:54.171
It's all about
the jewel tones, brother.

57:54.205 --> 57:56.507
Mm.

57:56.540 --> 57:58.142
Where'd that come from?

57:58.175 --> 58:00.077
Ah, don't worry about it, man.

58:00.110 --> 58:02.046
Yeah, I'm your brother,
and I'm worried about it.

58:02.079 --> 58:03.614
