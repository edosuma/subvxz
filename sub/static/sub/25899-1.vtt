00:57.950 --> 01:01.148
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a big welcome to Funny Cow!

01:06.070 --> 01:09.550
Thank you. Thank you very much,
and good evening.

01:10.310 --> 01:14.828
Can I just say how very, very nice
it is to be here this evening.

01:14.830 --> 01:16.668
It is. It's very nice.

01:16.670 --> 01:20.308
But, then again, I'm from Rotherham,
so it's... It's nice to be anywhere.

01:21.510 --> 01:24.187
You see, in Rotherham,
we're not twinned with anywhere.

01:24.189 --> 01:28.028
It's unfortunate, that. But we do have
a suicide pact with Doncaster.

01:30.629 --> 01:33.028
Now, talking of suicide...

01:33.030 --> 01:35.187
This bloke, right,
he goes into t'library,

01:35.189 --> 01:37.508
and he's having a mooch about,
looking up shelves.

01:37.510 --> 01:39.588
Librarian, she sees him,
so she goes over.

01:39.590 --> 01:41.748
She says, "Excuse me, sir.
Can I help you?"

01:41.750 --> 01:45.748
He said, "I'm looking for some books
on suicide, but I can't seem to find any."

01:45.750 --> 01:48.588
She says, "Yeah, that's 'cause the buggers
never bring 'em back."

01:51.869 --> 01:54.268
Look at my hands.
They're not right.

01:54.270 --> 01:57.268
Well, this one is. T'other one's left.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.070
But they're not like yours.
They're different.

02:04.189 --> 02:06.189
They've got no work in 'em.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.070
And that's tired me out.

02:09.910 --> 02:10.910
You see...

02:12.189 --> 02:14.828
I don't know whether
to hit you with 'em...

02:14.830 --> 02:16.670
Or stroke you with 'em.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.229
My dad were t'same with his,

02:21.390 --> 02:23.788
although he didn't go in
for stroking much.

02:23.790 --> 02:25.830
I don't think he knew he wanted to.

02:27.830 --> 02:29.989
I had a funny relationship with my dad.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.310
He were an 'ard man, very 'ard.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.348
I remember this kid on our street say,
"I bet my dad can beat up your dad."

02:38.350 --> 02:41.068
And I thought, "Fucking hell. When?"

02:43.430 --> 02:46.108
- Things changed when my dad died.
- Aw.

02:46.110 --> 02:47.750
What do you mean, "Aw?"

02:48.830 --> 02:50.987
My mam, she took it bad.

02:50.989 --> 02:52.150
She turned to drink.

02:53.110 --> 02:55.110
She went out on t'game.

02:56.830 --> 03:01.629
One night she come home
with one pound and two pence.

03:02.270 --> 03:05.428
I said, "Bloody hell, Mam,
who's give you two pence?"

03:05.430 --> 03:07.508
She said, "They all have."

03:10.869 --> 03:13.508
I was about eight or nine.
I was at school.

03:13.510 --> 03:16.030
And you know when you have to do
one of them talks?

03:16.910 --> 03:19.508
You know, what you're gonna be
when you grow up.

03:19.510 --> 03:21.788
And it were Yvonne Wilson, and she said...

03:21.790 --> 03:24.830
I should be a clown because I was silly.

03:25.830 --> 03:29.430
And Mr Harrison...
He were the teacher... He agreed.

03:30.830 --> 03:32.310
And I thought, "That's what I'll do.

03:33.830 --> 03:36.908
"It'll be my job to make 'em laugh."

04:28.390 --> 04:29.790
Oh.

04:30.869 --> 04:32.869
Thank you.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.989
Who are you?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.627
Are you famous?

05:08.629 --> 05:12.308
- How many houses have you got?
- Eh? What you on about?

05:12.310 --> 05:14.908
- One. One house.
- She says you've got seven.

05:14.910 --> 05:17.028
We haven't.
We've got one house, not seven.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.987
- Has she got five bikes?
- No.

05:18.989 --> 05:21.508
She hasn't got a bike. She borrows mine.

05:21.510 --> 05:24.388
She's a lying bastard.
Your sister's a lying bastard.

05:24.390 --> 05:27.348
You think I've gotta come down
from here, don't you?

05:27.350 --> 05:29.987
You think I've gotta come down.
Well, I'm not.

05:29.989 --> 05:32.028
Lying bastard. Bighead.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.508
Lying bastard. Bighead.

05:44.350 --> 05:46.028
- All right?
- Yeah.

05:46.030 --> 05:47.627
- Going down t'ginnel?
- Yeah.

05:47.629 --> 05:48.989
Good.

05:55.430 --> 05:57.508
Where are you going?

05:57.510 --> 05:59.588
I'm talking to you.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.508
You think you're summat, don't you?
Summat special.

06:02.510 --> 06:04.548
Well, you're not.
You're a piece of shit.

06:04.550 --> 06:06.227
Come on, bighead. Come on.

06:06.229 --> 06:07.867
Argh!

06:07.869 --> 06:11.948
She's covered in shit.
Look, shit-arse. You've shit yourself.

06:11.950 --> 06:14.908
- You dirty cow.
- I am. I'm a dirty cow, me.

06:14.910 --> 06:17.308
Eurgh. She's picked it up.
She's picked it up!

06:17.310 --> 06:20.068
Yeah, you can call me Dog Shit Dora.

06:38.550 --> 06:41.187
- Where have you been?
- Where's my mam?

06:41.189 --> 06:42.910
- Eh?
- Where's my mam?

06:44.070 --> 06:47.028
She's out there
with her stupid fucking mates...

06:47.030 --> 06:49.030
While I'm in here with no dinner.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.950
Make me a tea.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.748
What you doing?

07:02.750 --> 07:05.270
- I said make me a cup of tea.
- Get your own tea.

07:06.310 --> 07:08.310
- What did you say?
- You heard.

07:09.470 --> 07:14.150
Make me a fucking cup of tea now.

07:14.390 --> 07:17.229
Get your own cup of fucking tea.

07:20.470 --> 07:22.788
You cheeky little fucking...
Come here!

07:22.790 --> 07:24.948
Who do you think
you're fucking talking to?

07:24.950 --> 07:27.588
Shut your fucking mouth...

07:27.590 --> 07:31.668
...and don't answer me back,
you little fucking cow!

07:31.670 --> 07:33.590
Get up! Get up!

07:34.030 --> 07:36.030
Get fucking up!

07:38.750 --> 07:41.070
Are you angry, Dad?
You seem angry again.

07:42.510 --> 07:44.510
Get out. Get out.

07:50.150 --> 07:52.070
Fucking tea!

08:11.790 --> 08:13.470
Yippee.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.070
Page 116.

08:16.670 --> 08:19.750
The Day Thou Gave Us, Lord, Is Ended.

08:27.310 --> 08:29.508
Oh, it's bloody cold in here.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.750
It will warm up in a minute, Mam.

08:36.869 --> 08:38.869
Bye, you miserable bastard!

Oh, aye? I've got something
to tell you an' all.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.828
I've gone back taxiing.

10:16.830 --> 10:20.350
It'll be three quid back into town.

10:52.629 --> 10:54.470
Kitchen.

10:55.229 --> 10:58.950
Oh, fucking hell.

11:00.270 --> 11:02.508
Oh, it's nice.

11:02.510 --> 11:04.070
Oh, it's a double.

11:05.189 --> 11:06.588
Oh, I love it.

11:06.590 --> 11:09.110
Oh.

11:10.229 --> 11:11.989
Oh, fucking hell.

11:13.229 --> 11:15.629
- What do you reckon?
- It's fucking great.

11:16.229 --> 11:18.627
It's our house, where we live.

11:18.629 --> 11:20.908
Machines make a right racket.

11:20.910 --> 11:24.350
- Be quiet at night, though.
- Aw, it won't, though, will it?

11:25.910 --> 11:28.627
Give o'er. I've gotta get back to work.

11:28.629 --> 11:31.187
I'm gonna stay here, make it nice.

11:31.189 --> 11:33.590
Right. I'll see you in a bit.

11:35.830 --> 11:37.310
Here you are.

11:38.270 --> 11:41.268
- Get us some meat for us tea.
- Housekeeping?

11:41.270 --> 11:43.750
- Housekeeping money?
- It is, aye.

13:31.629 --> 13:33.629
Got us some chips.

13:51.629 --> 13:54.229
Well... Fucking say summat, then.

14:00.430 --> 14:02.070
Sit down.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.470
Sit down.

14:05.989 --> 14:09.308
- I brought chips in.
- I don't want any.

14:09.310 --> 14:12.470
Why's that, then?
Just to fucking wind me up?

14:13.470 --> 14:14.830
Eh?

14:16.790 --> 14:18.790
What's that you got?

14:19.989 --> 14:21.030
Nothing.

14:22.150 --> 14:23.588
Not for you.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.590
- Give it me here.
- No.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.670
Just to wind me up, eh?
Just to fucking wind me up?

14:37.790 --> 14:38.910
Are you angry, Bob?

14:40.390 --> 14:42.390
You seem angry.

16:02.910 --> 16:04.070
Hello.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.590
Good choice.

16:09.989 --> 16:12.750
Exupéry. Le Petit Prince.

16:14.430 --> 16:18.229
About a golden-haired child
who refuses to answer questions.

16:21.229 --> 16:22.790
Right.

16:23.270 --> 16:25.310
What is essential is invisible to the eye.

16:27.030 --> 16:29.430
- Sorry?
- That's what the book teaches us.

16:30.629 --> 16:32.350
What...

16:33.310 --> 16:34.590
You and me?

16:35.950 --> 16:37.550
All of us.

16:38.350 --> 16:40.308
Oh, well.

16:40.310 --> 16:43.268
I've a bin full of bills at home
and I can see 'em all.

16:43.270 --> 16:48.229
Well, the reason they're in the bin,
that's essential.

16:49.989 --> 16:51.590
That's what's essential.

16:57.229 --> 17:00.830
I'm Angus. This is my bookshop, so...

17:03.110 --> 17:04.310
How do, Angus?

17:05.310 --> 17:06.550
So, what do you like?

17:07.670 --> 17:11.069
- Like?
- To read. What do you like to read?

17:12.628 --> 17:15.147
Oh, I'm a seeker after knowledge, me.

17:15.150 --> 17:17.627
Ah. That's good.

17:17.628 --> 17:19.790
- Mmm.
- I like that.

17:20.109 --> 17:22.349
I've only just started, mind, so I'm a...

17:23.069 --> 17:24.948
I'm a new seeker.

17:24.950 --> 17:28.270
Well, I'm an ardent champion
of the new seeker, so...

17:28.910 --> 17:30.910
Ah, that's good.

17:34.510 --> 17:36.148
Would you like to go out for a drink?

17:36.150 --> 17:38.150
Oh, no.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.270
- Can I have...
- Four pint, two Babycham.

17:44.950 --> 17:47.227
'Ey, hang on. I'm first.

17:47.229 --> 17:49.550
Ah, shut your mouth
or you'll get a crack.

17:50.629 --> 17:53.189
That's not fair.
I've been here ten minutes.

17:54.869 --> 17:56.629
- Oh, aye?
- Aye.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.510
Fighting man, are you?

18:03.670 --> 18:05.470
- No.
- Oh.

18:06.550 --> 18:09.148
I'll give you till half ten to learn, eh?

18:09.150 --> 18:11.627
Silly bollocks. Eh?

18:11.629 --> 18:13.869
'Ey, what do you think of these?

18:15.110 --> 18:17.108
Nice, aren't they?

18:17.110 --> 18:19.068
- Guess where I got them.
- No idea.

18:19.070 --> 18:22.068
- Ravels. You know, on Chapel Walk.
- Ooh.

18:22.070 --> 18:24.108
Guess how much.

18:24.110 --> 18:26.110
Nine quid. Aren't they lovely?

18:26.950 --> 18:30.508
Mick don't know they were that much.
It'd kill him. His head would blow off.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.548
- Lovely, though, aren't they?
- Yeah.

18:32.550 --> 18:35.108
'Ey, it's heaving in here, in't it?
Ram-packed.

18:35.110 --> 18:36.867
Oh, this is nice. Is it new?

18:36.869 --> 18:38.428
- Yeah, it is.
- Where'd you get it?

18:38.430 --> 18:41.187
Club book. Twenty-seven payments.
I've only paid one.

18:41.189 --> 18:43.189
It's lovely.

18:46.910 --> 18:50.948
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to Crookes Club.

18:50.950 --> 18:55.068
I'd like you to put your hands together
and give a big Crookes Club welcome

18:55.070 --> 18:58.548
to the master of mirth... Lenny Lennon!

19:03.510 --> 19:07.030
Oh! Thank you. Lovely.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.508
Had a fella knock on my door last night.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.908
He said, "Do you believe in free speech?"

19:12.910 --> 19:16.627
I said, "Yes, I do."
He said, "Good, can I use your phone?"

19:16.629 --> 19:19.867
So, this fella in prison
says to his cellmate,

19:19.869 --> 19:21.430
"How long are you in for?"

19:21.670 --> 19:24.869
So this lag says to him,
"Just three days."

19:25.189 --> 19:29.867
So the fella says, "Three days?
That's great. How did you manage that?"

19:29.869 --> 19:32.588
And this old lag says,
"They're hanging me on Monday."

19:32.590 --> 19:34.987
They came to hang him.

19:34.989 --> 19:37.428
Him and the hangman,
they're walking across the yard

19:37.430 --> 19:41.108
on the day of the hanging,
and it's lashing it down with rain.

19:41.110 --> 19:43.028
So this lag says to t'hangman,

19:43.030 --> 19:44.830
"What a bloody day to be hanged."

19:45.150 --> 19:48.227
And t'hangman says, "I don't know
what you're complaining about.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.388
- I have to walk back in this."
- Shut up, you wazzock!

19:51.390 --> 19:55.148
Come on, ladies and gentlemen.
Let's have some order, please.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.428
- Give order.
- You can fuck off and all!

19:57.430 --> 20:00.627
Poor bastard's doing his best.
Give him a chance.

20:00.629 --> 20:04.428
Yeah, right.
Hey, I went to Bradford last week.

20:04.430 --> 20:08.428
Bloody Bradford.
I felt like the white spot on a domino.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.987
Ring 999 in Bradford
and they don't send t'police.

20:12.989 --> 20:15.948
I rang and t'Bengal Lancers turned up.

20:17.470 --> 20:20.748
So, anyway, I had a blackout last night.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.350
I did. I had a blackout.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.748
Seeing her tomorrow night and all.

20:48.510 --> 20:49.987
Got it! It's here.

20:49.989 --> 20:52.750
Right, come on, wakey-wakey.

20:53.350 --> 20:56.908
Get up, come on! Quick, t'pair of you!
Come on, up!

20:56.910 --> 20:59.748
Up, eh? Now, take a look.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.150
- Look at that. Look what we've got.
- What is it?

21:03.150 --> 21:04.948
It's a swimming pool.

21:04.950 --> 21:07.428
We've got a swimming pool.
How's about that, eh?

21:07.430 --> 21:10.470
Come on, then, downstairs!
Toast's on t'table.

21:14.030 --> 21:17.030
Don't tell anyone at school.
I mean it.

21:31.030 --> 21:32.950
Whoo!

21:36.830 --> 21:38.910
Bet it's nice and cold.

21:41.989 --> 21:44.028
More like a bath.

21:44.030 --> 21:45.908
What?

21:45.910 --> 21:48.150
Go and get your swimming cossie on, then.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.869
Mum, I love it.

21:51.629 --> 21:54.150
Go on, then. Upstairs.

21:54.470 --> 21:57.348
Get your swimming costume on.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.310
What swimming costume?
I ain't got a swimming costume.

22:00.550 --> 22:04.550
Get upstairs...
And put your dad's new underpants on.

22:04.830 --> 22:08.150
- Mum, please.
- Go on, do it!

22:08.750 --> 22:11.830
And never you mind that lot, eh?
They're only jealous.

22:12.910 --> 22:15.270
Come on. Down.

22:20.629 --> 22:23.187
Right, now go and have a swim.

22:23.189 --> 22:24.910
Come on, then, let's have a dip.

22:26.070 --> 22:28.510
I'm going to go underwater
for five minutes.

22:31.550 --> 22:32.670
That's it, girl.

22:33.430 --> 22:35.910
That weren't five minutes.
That were two seconds.

22:44.229 --> 22:48.590
By the time I were ten,
kids at school had sniffed me out.

22:50.229 --> 22:52.270
I wasn't one of them...

22:53.189 --> 22:55.070
And I couldn't hide it.

22:55.830 --> 22:58.629
I tried for a while,
you know, pretended...

22:59.590 --> 23:01.987
But it were pointless.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.108
There were fumes coming off me.

23:04.110 --> 23:09.390
I started acting up, playing the goat,
letting it all out.

23:11.510 --> 23:13.030
So they beat me...

23:14.310 --> 23:16.310
And then they isolated me.

23:17.350 --> 23:18.790
You see...

23:19.790 --> 23:23.110
Unstable bitches
aren't tolerated in the pack.

23:27.629 --> 23:30.950
And once the die is cast, well, that's it.

23:32.830 --> 23:34.830
Once you're on the outside...

23:36.989 --> 23:38.470
That's where you're staying.

23:57.670 --> 24:01.510
Mike. Fucking hell. Mike!
Look who's here.

24:05.430 --> 24:07.308
Oh, fuck. Has she seen you?

24:07.310 --> 24:09.510
No, she's seen our Liam.
I'm not going.

24:12.430 --> 24:16.229
Hey, where you going? Stay up there.
Stay up there with Debs.

24:21.310 --> 24:23.390
Oh. Stop breathing.

24:38.950 --> 24:40.948
Oh, shit. She's not going.

24:40.950 --> 24:42.950
Go on. She's your sister.

24:45.270 --> 24:48.830
- Go on.
- Please, don't start. Promise?

24:49.750 --> 24:51.830
I'm not promising anything.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.950
- All right.
- Hiya.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.187
Thought I'd pop round.
Haven't seen you for a bit.

25:03.189 --> 25:04.989
No.

25:05.790 --> 25:08.910
Well, can I... Come in?

25:09.229 --> 25:12.550
- Yeah, yeah, you'd best come in, yeah.
- Thanks.

25:15.229 --> 25:16.869
Hi, Jean.

25:20.229 --> 25:22.229
We're just about to have us dinner.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.670
- Where's yours?
- I'm not bothered. I'll eat later.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.308
Sit down.

25:33.310 --> 25:36.470
- Can we go out and play?
- No, sit down.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.508
- What you doing? Sit down.
- Excuse me. No, no, no.

25:39.510 --> 25:42.548
I've said they can go out and play.
Go out and play. Come on.

25:42.550 --> 25:43.550
Liam.

25:48.629 --> 25:50.629
Go on, out you go, then.

25:55.629 --> 25:58.428
Right. I'm off out.

25:58.430 --> 26:01.110
- Where you going?
- Told you. Out.

26:02.030 --> 26:04.310
It was lovely to see you, Jean.

26:18.430 --> 26:19.910
You should have phoned.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.189
See you, Mike.

27:01.310 --> 27:03.310
Come on. Come away.

27:27.790 --> 27:28.790
Hello.

27:29.830 --> 27:31.550
Do you mind if I join you?

27:32.229 --> 27:33.910
It's a free country.

27:47.750 --> 27:49.950
- I want to do what you do.
- Oh, aye.

27:50.830 --> 27:52.989
Yeah, I saw you at t'club at Crookes Club.

27:53.229 --> 27:54.869
Oh, did you?

27:55.910 --> 27:56.989
Yeah.

27:59.229 --> 28:01.989
I wanna do what you do.
I wanna make people laugh.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.627
I wouldn't bother.
Waste of time.

28:05.629 --> 28:07.910
Why do you say that? It i'nt.

28:08.150 --> 28:11.310
- I'm funny.
- Are you, love? That's good.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.590
I am.

28:17.470 --> 28:18.550
I doubt it.

28:20.270 --> 28:22.270
It's not a job for a woman.

28:23.030 --> 28:25.830
Why do you think
all comics are blokes, love?

28:26.070 --> 28:27.828
I'll tell you why.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.910
Cos women aren't funny.

28:30.229 --> 28:32.670
Don't know why, but they're just not.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.108
You're not funny.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.350
No.

28:38.189 --> 28:40.750
- I mean...
- Singing. Can you sing?

28:41.510 --> 28:44.588
They'll let you sing for 'em,
as long as you're not wearing much.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.428
Or you could be a stripper.

28:46.430 --> 28:49.028
They'd like you
if you took your clothes off,

28:49.030 --> 28:50.910
maybe flash your fanny for 'em.

28:51.950 --> 28:53.950
But don't try and make 'em laugh.

28:54.869 --> 28:58.350
They'd be on you like a pack of wolves,
tear you to shreds.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.790
I'd conquer 'em with love.

29:01.470 --> 29:03.790
Yeah, well, good luck with that, love.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.867
Look, you don't understand.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.790
Oh, I do.

29:08.070 --> 29:10.867
- Only too well.
- I've got no choice.

29:10.869 --> 29:12.030
I can't...

29:12.950 --> 29:15.268
I can't do what everyone else does. I...

29:15.270 --> 29:18.869
I can't be a civilian.
See, I've got no backbone.

29:19.989 --> 29:21.788
I've got a funny bone instead.

29:21.790 --> 29:23.150
Listen to me, love.

29:23.830 --> 29:27.148
Thirty year ago,
I thought I were funny as fuck.

29:27.150 --> 29:29.627
It's not about being funny, darling.

29:29.629 --> 29:31.867
It's about surviving.

29:31.869 --> 29:33.869
Try breathing slower.

29:41.470 --> 29:46.428
- I'm on at Dial House, Sunday dinner.
- Right. I'll come.

29:46.430 --> 29:49.310
Right, then, I'm off.
You'll have me as daft as you.

30:31.550 --> 30:33.310
- Mam?
- Mmm?

30:36.869 --> 30:38.869
Where's all your chairs?

30:41.229 --> 30:42.430
Gone.

30:42.869 --> 30:44.869
- All of 'em?
- Mmm.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.950
And your table?
And your sideboard?

30:50.510 --> 30:52.510
Mam, you can't carry on like this.

30:53.989 --> 30:55.310
Don't fuss, love.

30:56.350 --> 30:57.950
Be all right.

31:04.790 --> 31:06.470
I made you a pie.

31:07.189 --> 31:09.948
Looks like a bus.

31:09.950 --> 31:12.790
Fucking hellfire.
Look at the state of it in here.

31:13.270 --> 31:15.270
- Bob.
- Still with him, are you?

31:16.150 --> 31:19.150
Aye, course you are.

31:19.910 --> 31:22.670
Right, give her her pie. Come on.

31:27.270 --> 31:29.308
Oh, Mam.

31:29.310 --> 31:32.070
Aye. Never mind.

31:55.950 --> 31:58.350
Hello.

31:58.910 --> 32:00.748
Hello.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.588
Back for The Little Prince?

32:02.590 --> 32:03.828
Eh?

32:03.830 --> 32:06.310
The book. You were reading it
last time you came in.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.108
- Was I?
- Yes.

32:08.110 --> 32:10.590
No, I was just window shopping.

32:12.470 --> 32:14.508
- So, how much are they?
- What?

32:14.510 --> 32:15.590
Your windows.

32:16.550 --> 32:17.550
Eh?

32:18.550 --> 32:19.989
I was only joking.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.470
Oh. Sorry. Of course.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.670
Put t'kettle on.
Spitting feathers here.

32:27.790 --> 32:30.670
Kettle, yes, of course, of course.
Come on through.

32:36.310 --> 32:38.590
- Here you go.
- Oh.

32:39.310 --> 32:40.430
Ta.

32:41.390 --> 32:43.627
Don't tell me
you're interested in etymology?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.229
I wouldn't dream of it.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.070
- What's... ety...?
- Etymology?

32:48.390 --> 32:51.310
It's a... It's a passion of mine.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.310
This book you were looking at.

32:55.590 --> 32:57.350
I wasn't looking, really.

32:58.229 --> 33:00.108
Sniffing, yeah.

33:00.110 --> 33:02.548
Looking, no.

33:02.550 --> 33:04.629
Sniffing?

33:07.150 --> 33:10.548
I love the smell of books.
Don't you?

33:10.550 --> 33:12.110
Yes, I... I suppose so.

33:13.030 --> 33:16.150
I like leather, the smell of new leather.

33:17.390 --> 33:20.468
Sandals at Whitsuntide,
and that sort of thing.

33:20.470 --> 33:22.470
Brings to mind...

33:26.830 --> 33:29.390
- I'm glad you came back.
- I bet you are.

33:32.150 --> 33:34.668
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's wrong?

33:34.670 --> 33:37.028
The tea.

33:37.030 --> 33:40.310
What did you do?
Just show the cup a picture of a tea bag?

33:41.229 --> 33:43.268
I'm sorry. I'm...

33:43.270 --> 33:45.430
I'm not a tea man, generally.

33:47.229 --> 33:49.229
So where will we go?

33:50.670 --> 33:54.189
- Where will you take me?
- On a... Date?

33:55.150 --> 33:58.428
Do you mean a date?

33:58.430 --> 34:00.150
You're old-fashioned.

34:01.310 --> 34:02.989
Hopelessly.

34:04.189 --> 34:06.550
And I'm intelligent. Um...

34:07.189 --> 34:09.987
I can be very, very... Reasonable.

34:09.989 --> 34:12.790
Um, usually optimistic.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.389
Often depressed.

34:15.790 --> 34:18.547
I mean, properly, properly depressed.

34:18.550 --> 34:20.869
The whole nine yards. I can't talk.

34:21.310 --> 34:24.388
Uh, I can't get out of bed.
Mmm...

34:24.389 --> 34:27.310
And I get panic attacks and I snore.

34:27.869 --> 34:31.027
Oh, and I can become
extraordinarily angry...

34:31.030 --> 34:34.989
Enough. I'll come round tomorrow.
You can take me out for dinner.

34:39.830 --> 34:44.429
Can I ask you what changed your mind
about me, about a date?

34:45.350 --> 34:47.150
You can ask, yeah.

34:47.989 --> 34:51.867
But, you'd just smile
and refuse to answer?

34:51.869 --> 34:54.869
You're right.
So there's your answer.

35:21.229 --> 35:23.229
Wow.

35:24.430 --> 35:26.430
Wow.

35:28.430 --> 35:31.430
Isn't that the most beautiful film
you've ever seen?

35:33.989 --> 35:38.070
That red...
That vibrant Titian red is just...

35:38.510 --> 35:40.670
- Did you enjoy it?
- Yeah.

35:45.030 --> 35:47.068
- Thank you.
- All right.

35:47.070 --> 35:49.788
Thank you. Thank you very much.

35:49.790 --> 35:51.989
- Which part did you like the best?
- Um...

35:52.670 --> 35:54.908
- The balloons.
- What, at the end?

35:54.910 --> 35:56.270
Yeah, at the end.

36:04.629 --> 36:05.910
What's his name?

36:07.989 --> 36:09.590
Doesn't matter.

36:11.989 --> 36:13.750
Bob.

36:14.670 --> 36:16.189
It's Bob.

36:17.350 --> 36:19.629
And you and Bob, do you get on?

36:20.430 --> 36:22.227
Does he make you laugh?

36:22.229 --> 36:24.950
Oh, aye. He's hysterical.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.910
You're being sarcastic, right?

36:31.550 --> 36:32.948
Do you love him?

36:32.950 --> 36:34.750
No, of course not.

36:35.310 --> 36:38.189
- Does he...
- What? Knock me about?

36:39.350 --> 36:40.470
Yeah, he does.

36:42.670 --> 36:44.189
Happy now?

36:44.989 --> 36:46.150
Happy?

36:47.189 --> 36:49.229
Why on Earth
would I be happy to hear that?

36:49.470 --> 36:51.550
Well, you can be me rescuer,
can't you?

36:51.950 --> 36:53.950
Play at shining knights.

36:55.629 --> 36:57.629
I'm a damsel in distress.

36:59.030 --> 37:01.068
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

37:01.070 --> 37:03.110
Who took your self-esteem from you?

37:03.950 --> 37:06.187
You have very low self-esteem.

37:06.189 --> 37:09.830
Nobody took it.
I handed it over of my own volition.

37:11.950 --> 37:13.950
So what you gonna say now?

37:16.150 --> 37:20.070
In life, people get
what they think they deserve.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.989
That's hard to watch.

37:26.229 --> 37:30.428
I mean, why is it all the beautiful people
are fucked-up

37:30.430 --> 37:33.229
and all the wankers
bestride the Earth untouched?

37:33.629 --> 37:38.150
Don't know. Why is easy-listening
music so hard to listen to?

37:38.869 --> 37:41.950
- I'm being serious.
- Don't be.

37:43.950 --> 37:45.270
So what about you?

37:46.590 --> 37:47.910
Why aren't you married?

37:48.670 --> 37:51.588

I'm telling you, you've...
You've got fucking nothing to come!

55:15.670 --> 55:17.790
Listen!

55:39.989 --> 55:42.030
Oh...

55:44.950 --> 55:46.430
Oh...

56:38.869 --> 56:40.869
That's yours.

56:41.510 --> 56:43.350
Thank you very much.
Enjoy the book.

56:50.189 --> 56:51.989
Right, then.

56:52.310 --> 56:54.150
Hello.

56:55.470 --> 56:57.070
Right, then, what?

57:00.790 --> 57:02.550
You can start rescuing.

57:06.550 --> 57:07.790
What's happened?

57:08.830 --> 57:10.030
I'm here now.

57:10.869 --> 57:12.070
I'm here with you.

57:13.270 --> 57:15.430
I've come to share the tragedy.

57:18.470 --> 57:20.189
All right.

57:21.869 --> 57:23.629
Well, that's um...

57:26.790 --> 57:28.590
Ah, that's wonder... Wonderful.

57:30.869 --> 57:32.869
That's really wonderful.

57:52.869 --> 57:54.670
Fucking hell.

58:14.070 --> 58:15.390
Fucking hell.

58:20.070 --> 58:21.670
Fucking hell.

58:27.270 --> 58:29.308
Fuck me.

58:31.830 --> 58:35.310
Fucking hell.
Two fucking bathrooms?

58:36.229 --> 58:38.110
Fucking hell.

58:50.390 --> 58:51.750
Fucking hell.

58:58.310 --> 59:00.627
Fucking... Hell.

59:11.070 --> 59:12.790
Cup of tea?

59:13.750 --> 59:16.110
Fucking hell.

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:08.470
I've left him.

01:00:08.830 --> 01:00:10.869
Oh, aye?

01:00:13.229 --> 01:00:14.430
Leaving present?

01:00:16.229 --> 01:00:18.869
- Something to remind me.
- Aye.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.830
Can't go on living a lie.

01:00:27.350 --> 01:00:29.110
Can't you?

01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:31.790
It's a pity.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.270
You think I should, don't you?

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.229
It's not weak to leave, Mam.

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:42.950
It's weak to stay.

01:00:43.869 --> 01:00:45.030
Is it?

01:01:16.229 --> 01:01:20.550
I went to see a counsellor, a therapist.

01:01:21.470 --> 01:01:23.788
And he said,

01:01:23.790 --> 01:01:28.550
"You need to learn to cultivate
a more fatalistic approach to life.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.670
Learn that it's better
just to let life happen."

01:01:35.229 --> 01:01:37.510
I wanted to smack him in the face.

01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.790
Be somebody else?
Is that what he meant?

01:01:44.189 --> 01:01:45.950
How can I do that?

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.310
So that is it. It's...

01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:54.110
It's that or face the madness.

01:01:55.229 --> 01:01:57.550
The monster behind the eyes.

01:01:58.830 --> 01:02:01.470
And this therapist, he gave me tablets.

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:03.790
Hold me together.

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:06.910
Give me a level playing field.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.470
Give me a chance, he said.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.428
But then you're just...
You're just cut adrift

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:19.748
with a... Trail of tablets
to get you back,

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:21.910
and, well, that's too scary.

01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.150
You can't hold onto tablets
when you're drowning.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.388
Too small.

01:03:00.869 --> 01:03:04.030
You meet different people, don't you?

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:08.790
Educated people.
Articulate people.

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:15.348
And you think, "I'm one of them.

01:03:15.350 --> 01:03:18.189
Oh, thank God I'm one of them!"

01:03:19.229 --> 01:03:23.110
And then one day it hits you over
the back of the head like an 'ammer.

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.550
You don't belong with them either.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:31.590
Because they're so wrapped up
in themselves, they can't feel anything.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.590
And they're scared and judgemental.

01:03:35.989 --> 01:03:38.308
And they're too busy
trying to insulate themselves

01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:40.308
against the cold winds
that'll topple them.

01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:44.310
However high they hold their head, they'll
still get a whiff of the shit they're in.

01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:49.150
You end up becoming the person
you're pretending to be, don't you?

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:51.229
Invent yourself.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:55.510
It always felt like a film to me.

01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:58.989
Like I'm playing meself in a film,
you know.

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:04.390
There's a big part of me standing on
the side, you know, watching me perform.

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:08.348
Oh, and I've always been writing
my autobiography.

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.308
Hmm. You know, and if...
If the story didn't fit

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:14.750
or I... I didn't like the version
of meself, well, then, I...

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.470
I'd spit it out.

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:23.470
Or swallow it.

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:41.790
Hello?

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:19.668
Waaaahhh!

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:21.750
Jesus!

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.510
You frightened the bloody life out of me!

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:30.028
Christ. Haven't you got
anything better to do?

01:05:30.030 --> 01:05:31.670
Not that I can think of.

01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:36.950
Ooh, Angus. There's a terrible smell
of brown ale in here.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.950
Excuse me.

01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:44.627
Fart arse.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:50.310
Happy?

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:53.068
You what?

01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:54.350
Are you happy?

01:05:55.790 --> 01:05:57.189
I'm delirious.

01:05:57.989 --> 01:05:59.350
You know what I meant.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:02.590
No, I don't.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.550
It's a simple enough question.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:07.989
It isn't, though, is it?

01:06:08.670 --> 01:06:10.470
Happiness comes and goes.

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:15.028
Look... I can't walk round
grinning like a Cheshire cat.

01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:16.470
I'm just not like that.

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:20.627
Know what I think?

01:06:20.629 --> 01:06:22.670
Hmm. What?

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.548
I think we should have children.

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.987
Why? You pregnant?

01:06:30.989 --> 01:06:34.150
Can you imagine? Our child?

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:36.989
You'd be an amazing mother.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.348
Are you mad?

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:42.590
Ah, you would. You really would.
It would be the making of you.

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:45.590
You'd take to it like a duck to water.

01:06:46.229 --> 01:06:48.627
- No.
- You don't have to answer now.

01:06:48.629 --> 01:06:50.510
I don't want children.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:53.348
- I don't.
- Can't say that.

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:56.670
Oh, can't I? Right.
So now you're telling me what I can't say?

01:06:57.150 --> 01:07:02.150
All I meant... "Never say never," right?
That's all I meant by that.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:06.788
You'll change your mind, you'll see.

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.270
I won't, though.

01:07:09.830 --> 01:07:11.270
I've already had an abortion.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.989
What?

01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:15.869
You heard.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:17.950
Bob's.

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:22.430
Well...

01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:26.989
You weren't meant to be
with him anyway, were you?

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:34.910
It's all right. It's not a problem.
I'm all right with it.

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.989
Well, thank you, that's very big of you.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.350
- Are you sulking?
- No.

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.750
I... I'm just being honest.

01:07:51.229 --> 01:07:53.350
That's what you want from me,
isn't it, honesty?

01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:58.470
I can't have children, Angus.

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:03.310
Not physically, not mentally.

01:08:04.629 --> 01:08:07.068
I shouldn't be allowed to have children.

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:10.108
- Somebody needs to break the circle.
- What circle?

01:08:10.110 --> 01:08:12.670
Monkey see, monkey do,
and I'd do, I know I would.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.950
So I won't have children.

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:18.470
So now you know.

01:08:20.910 --> 01:08:21.910
Right.

01:08:23.189 --> 01:08:24.790
Well, we'll see, won't we?

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:47.428
What's wrong?

01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:49.627
Just feeling a bit rough.

01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:52.670
Rough? You look terrible.

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:57.229
- What's wrong?
- I aren't a doctor, am I?

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:02.227
Where does it hurt?

01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:04.388
Sheffield, Leeds...

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.109
Barnsley. It bloody kills in Barnsley.

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:11.268
Shall I get someone?

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:13.787
Yeah, get Raquel Welch.

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:18.108
Tell her I need mouth-to-mouth,
or a cock rub. Either'll do.

01:09:18.109 --> 01:09:19.787
Stop it.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.667
Just got here.
I'm on in an hour and a half.

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:34.310
- Well, you can't.
- I've got to. Be reight.

01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:37.587
Right, well, let's get you inside.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.390
Come on.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:45.108
- Oh.
- Watch your head.

01:09:45.109 --> 01:09:46.390
Oh.

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:50.550
Ooh.

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:56.189
Lenny! There you are.

01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:02.869
You all right, lad?

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:06.550
I can't go on, Danny.

01:10:06.989 --> 01:10:09.350
You can't go on?
What on earth are you talking about?

01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:12.748
You have to go on. I confirmed you
last week. Course you can go on.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.227
- He's poorly.
- Come on.

01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:17.227
Shit, shower, shampoo.
You know the rest.

01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:18.989
No, I'm finished.

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:23.310
Not just tonight. Full stop.

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:26.470
I'm packing it in, Danny.
I've had enough.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:30.227
- Look, look, do this spot tonight...
- No, I'm done.

01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:34.227
Do this spot tonight, then come and see me
in the office tomorrow, we'll have a chat.

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:36.390
Will you be said? No more.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:40.627
Right. So what do I tell
the Con Sec, then?

01:10:40.629 --> 01:10:42.908
Tell him you don't feel like it?

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:47.148
I've got a reputation, Lenny,
years to build, a second to lose.

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:51.108
I won't be able to find a replacement at
this time, so you'll just have to go on.

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:55.828
You don't need no-one.
Put this one on. She'll not let you down.

01:10:55.830 --> 01:10:59.948
Lenny, they're expecting a comic,
not a singer or whatever it is.

01:10:59.950 --> 01:11:01.828
- She is a comic.
- I don't think so.

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:03.910
I am. I am.
That's what I am. I'm a comic.

01:11:04.629 --> 01:11:08.627
Listen, love, that lot out there
will tear you to pieces.

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:11.828
They'll sniff you and dig you out
as soon as you open your mouth,

01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:13.227
possibly even before.

01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:14.788
I'll conquer 'em with love.

01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:17.668
Oh, love? Yeah, well, good luck with that.

01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:20.310
She can do it. She's a funny cow.

01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:24.110
Like you said,
you won't find anyone else.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:27.150
I'll do it for nowt.

01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:32.308
Right.

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:34.508
You do ten minutes.

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:36.590
I'll speak with the Con Sec.

01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:39.470
Don't fuck it up.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:47.229
Shit.

- Yeah!
- Marvellous.

01:13:06.030 --> 01:13:10.229
Now, then, let's have a big Crookes
Club welcome for your next turn.

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.950
Put your hands together

Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.348
I love a warm hand on me entrance.

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.867
Anyway, I were sat at home
the other day

01:13:35.869 --> 01:13:37.390
and there was a knock at the door.

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:40.668
So I gets up and I goes to t'door
and there's a fella standing there

01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:43.910
and he says, "Hello, love.
Do you believe in free speech?"

01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:46.308
I says, "Yes, I do."
He says, "Great."

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:49.308
- "Can I use your phone?"
- "Can I use your phone?"

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:05.030
- You've ruined me act.
- What act? You're shit!

01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:07.388
Oh, no, no, you've ruined it.

01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:10.548
I was just gonna do an impression
of a cunt and you beat me to it.

01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:17.629
- Get your tits out!
- Oh-ho-ho.

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:21.308
If your cock was as big as your mouth,
I'd think about it.

01:14:22.510 --> 01:14:28.748
By the way, excuse me, what do you
call a woman who likes small cocks?

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:31.548
What's your name, love?

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:33.550
Janet.

01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:35.468
She's heard it!

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:41.428
Anyway, right, there were
these three blokes sat in a pub,

01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:43.828
all sat at separate tables,
having a pint.

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:47.908
There were a poof, there were a Paki
and there was this English bloke.

01:14:47.910 --> 01:14:51.588
Out of nowhere
appears this fairy godmother.

01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:55.670
She says,
"I've come to grant you one wish.

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:57.948
"All of you, one wish each.

01:14:57.950 --> 01:15:01.627
"Whatever you want,
your wish is my command."

01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:06.430
So she goes back to t'Paki and she says,
"So, sunshine, what would you like?"

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.227
And he thinks about it for a second
and he says,

01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:14.068
"You know what I am thinking?
I would like to take all my friends

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:17.028
"and all my family
and all my people..."

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.308
He's a Welsh Paki, by the way.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:23.148
He says, "And I'd like
to take them back all to Pakistan

01:15:23.150 --> 01:15:27.987
"where we can live happy ever after,
with no bother, no racism."

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:30.308
So she thinks,
"Great. Right, there you go.

01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:31.948
"There's your wish granted."

01:15:31.950 --> 01:15:35.348
Anyway, she turns to t'poof and she says,
"Hello, sweetheart. What would you like?"

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:37.590
He says, "Well, actually,
you know what I'd like?"

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:41.510
He said, "I'd like me and all my bum chums

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:45.948
"to go and live on a big island
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:49.790
"where we can live free and happy
and no-one to bother us."

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:53.189
So she says,
"All right, there's your wish granted."

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:57.108
Anyway, t'English fella's sat there
just finishing off his pint,

01:15:57.110 --> 01:16:00.108
and she says, "All right, sunshine,
what would you like?"

01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:01.828
And he sits and he looks at her.

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:04.388
He says, "Can you just run those
past me again?"

01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:07.508
She says, "Yeah." He says, "So, t'Paki,
he wants to go back to Pakistan

01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.468
"with all his family and friends
and all his kind."

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:13.388
"Yeah," she says. He says, "And t'poof,
he wants to go and live on an island

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:16.908
"in t'middle of t'Pacific and bum himself
to oblivion with all his bum chums."

01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:18.987
She says, "Yes."

01:16:18.989 --> 01:16:21.470
So he sits, he stares into his pint
and he says,

01:16:21.750 --> 01:16:23.788
"You know what?
I'll just have another pint."

01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:29.788
Get off, split arse!

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:32.748
Hey, now, I'm getting 50 quid
to make a twat of meself.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.910
What are you getting?

01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:39.588
Oh, 'ey, me mother rung t'other night.

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:42.227
Ooh, she were distraught, she were.
It were awful.

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:44.390
I says, "Are you all right?"
She says, "No, love, I'm not."

01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:47.510
I says, "What's the matter?"
She says, "It's your father."

01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:50.148
She says,
"I've just come back from t'doctor's

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:54.828
"and he's been diagnosed
with Alzheimer's... and VD."

01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:56.627
I says, "Oh." She says, "Yes."

01:16:56.629 --> 01:17:02.428
She says, "Worst thing is, I've left
t'back door open and he's disappeared."

01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:05.348
I says, "Well, Mother, if he comes back,
whatever you do, don't fuck him."

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:07.867
Hey! I'll fuck you!

01:17:07.869 --> 01:17:09.908
- Ooh!
- Settle down! Give her a chance!

01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:14.028
You couldn't fuck your way
out of a paper bag, sunshine.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:21.508
Time to get home
and get some fucking housework done!

01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:22.748
Ooh!

01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:28.110
Why don't you shut your mouth,
you big, ugly, boring cunt?

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:36.028
You're so ugly, when you were born,
t'midwife slapped your mother.

01:17:37.150 --> 01:17:40.070
You're so boring, when you're
wanking, your wrists fall asleep.

01:17:41.070 --> 01:17:43.748
Get the fuck off. Fuck off!

01:17:45.270 --> 01:17:49.430
Hey, now, what's the difference
between jam and marmalade?

01:17:50.910 --> 01:17:53.108
You can't marmalade your cock
up a bird's arse.

01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:38.908
Confucius say, "Man who drop watch
in toilet have shitty time."

01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:48.268
Hello, Incontinence Helpline.
Can you hold?

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:11.070
How many animals
can you fit on a toilet?

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:14.989
One pussy and a thousand hares.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:25.590
Give a man a fish
and he'll feed himself for a day.

01:19:26.869 --> 01:19:31.989
Give a man hope... And he'll starve
to death hoping for a fish.

01:19:36.030 --> 01:19:39.430
Take my life, please.

01:19:58.030 --> 01:20:02.068
Now, have any of you read any of them
lonely hearts adverts in t'paper?

01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:05.788
Lying bastards, aren't they?
Eh? Lying bastards.

01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:09.830
You can't believe a word they say,
honestly.

01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:13.748
"Adventurous."
That means they like anal.

01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:19.068
"Intelligent." Smelly fanny.

01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:25.788
"Curvy." Fat twat.

01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:27.308
"Cuddly."

01:20:27.310 --> 01:20:29.428
Fatter twat.

01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:31.308
"Likes eating out."

01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:33.588
Lazy fat twat.

01:20:37.869 --> 01:20:40.508
That was the wonderful Funny Cow.

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:42.270
Ladies and gentlemen, Funny Cow!

01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:45.508
I mean it.
I'll get you double Lenny's money.

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:47.748
I'll keep you busy five nights a week.

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.187
You sign with me,
I'll take you all the way.

01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:52.508
- Where to?
- Where to?

01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:54.828
Top of the greasy pole, that's where.

01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:56.788
I'm gonna make you a star, darling.

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:59.229
- Oh, twinkle, twinkle.
- I mean it.

01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:01.948
Don't tease me.

01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:04.948
I'm not teasing, I don't tease
and I don't mess around,

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:06.627
because I am all business.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:09.590
Are yer? Well, I'm 40% cheese.

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.470
Lenny.

01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:29.388
- How now. What news?
- He's almost supp'd.

01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.948
Why have you left the chamber?

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:34.030
- Hath he ask'd for me?
- Know you not he has?

01:21:34.629 --> 01:21:37.310
We will proceed no further
in this business.

01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:39.187
He hath honour'd me of late

01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:42.390
and I have bought golden opinions
from all sorts of places,

01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:48.187
which would be worn now in their newest
gloss, not cast aside so soon.

01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:51.627
Was the hope drunk
wherein you dress'd yourself?

01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:53.668
Hath it slept since?

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:57.350
And wakes it now
to look so green and pale?

01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:00.867
- Where did you go?
- Barbados.

01:22:00.869 --> 01:22:02.908
Sarcasm doesn't suit you, you know that?

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:05.428
Ah, you don't think so?
That's a shame.

01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:08.867
- Why did you leave?
- 'Cause I was bored shitless.

01:22:08.869 --> 01:22:12.348
Of Shakespeare?
You're telling me Shakespeare's boring?

01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:15.468
No, I'm telling you I was bored.
It's just not my thing.

01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:16.987
Well, what is?

01:22:16.989 --> 01:22:20.150
I don't know.
Not bleedin' Pinky and bleedin' Perky.

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:22.430
It's 'cause I'm thick, all right?

01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:25.428
No, no, you're not thick. Far from it.

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:27.908
I couldn't understand
half of what they were saying

01:22:27.910 --> 01:22:30.148
and when they started laughing,
I wanted to kill 'em.

01:22:30.150 --> 01:22:32.348
And that bloke sat behind us
mouthing the words

01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:35.750
like he's at some sing-along, making sure
the audience are watching him.

01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:39.428
You don't have to be threatened by it.
Shakespeare's for everyone.

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:43.189
It's not, though, is it?
Because you lot have hijacked it.

01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:46.308
"You lot"?
What do you mean by that?

01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:49.430
You know. The educated.

01:22:50.030 --> 01:22:54.830
Oh, right, right. So, would you rather
that I wasn't educated? Is that it?

01:22:55.869 --> 01:23:01.748
Would you rather I went to the football,
drank lager, came home and... Beat you?

01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:04.028
Would you like that? Is that it?
Is that what you'd prefer?

01:23:04.030 --> 01:23:05.268
- Drag my knuckles?
- No.

01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:08.348
I'd prefer you didn't bring me here
like some Liza fucking Doolittle.

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.229
I just don't want it.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:13.189
What do you think my motivation was?

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:17.989
I just wanted you to enjoy it with me,
a shared experience.

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:20.790
I don't have some fucking agenda.

01:23:21.150 --> 01:23:24.987
I love you and I wanted us to have
a nice night out together at the theatre.

01:23:24.989 --> 01:23:26.550
Is that so bad?

01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:28.627
Well, I don't.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.110
You don't what?

01:23:31.390 --> 01:23:32.390
Love you.

01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:35.150
W...

01:23:39.229 --> 01:23:41.070
I'm sorry, Angus.

01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:43.150
Really, I am.

01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:45.750
I don't know how you...

01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:48.550
I've been inside you.

01:23:50.189 --> 01:23:51.310
I know.

01:23:53.790 --> 01:23:57.350
Don't finish it, please.
We're good together.

01:23:58.629 --> 01:24:01.189
I can change. I can and I will.

01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:06.030
I don't want to be on my own.
I don't want to be alone. Please.

01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:08.148
I've waited so long
for somebody like you.

01:24:08.150 --> 01:24:10.950
Look, you can't make me love you...

01:24:12.150 --> 01:24:13.989
Because I can't love.

01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:18.468
It's not you. You're lovely
and you're funny and you're kind.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.869
Well, don't fucking finish it, then.

01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:23.788
If all that's true,
don't finish it, please.

01:24:23.790 --> 01:24:25.830
You are better off without me.

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.470
No. No, I'm not. I'm fucking not.

01:24:31.229 --> 01:24:33.548
- I'm a monster.
- No.

01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:36.508
I am. I'm...
I'm barbaric and I'm sentimental.

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:38.187
Is that the right word?

01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:41.748
I could kill somebody, chop up the body
and put it in a tartan biscuit tin.

01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:43.229
I'm fucked!

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:51.030
You don't tell me to shut up.
You don't tell me to be quiet.

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:53.388
Of course I don't.
Why would I do that?

01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:55.189
I love you.

01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:57.950
That is love to me...

01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:00.790
And it's not your fault.

01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:04.989
I'm going now.

01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:07.790
Where are you going?

01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:12.110
Are you going back to him
so he can squash you and beat you?

01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:16.390
No.

01:25:18.590 --> 01:25:19.910
Take care, Angus.

01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:25.910
If you knew how much I was hurting inside,
you wouldn't do this. You wouldn't.

01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:27.750
Goodbye, Angus.

01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:27.670
How do?

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:37.750
I was waiting for you to come.

01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:42.270
I didn't know if you were gonna come.

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:48.670
I wouldn't have blamed you
if you didn't come.

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.310
Er...

01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:58.070
It's for...

01:27:00.989 --> 01:27:03.588
It makes me daft when I take it off.

01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:06.428
It's a shame, 'cause it suits you.

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.350
Yeah.

01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:11.110
Look at me hands.

01:27:12.430 --> 01:27:14.270
They're all...

01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:21.310
I've been waiting for you to come
'cause I wanted to tell you...

01:27:25.950 --> 01:27:27.790
I'm really...

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:30.350
I'm really sorry...

01:27:31.989 --> 01:27:33.869
For everything that went on.

01:27:35.070 --> 01:27:36.390
And...

01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:39.350
And um...

01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:44.110
I'm sorry for shouting at you.

01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:51.068
I'm sorry for... Always shouting at you,
'cause you didn't deserve it,

01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:54.108
and I'm sorry that I hit you,

01:27:54.110 --> 01:27:57.229
and I know you had to go,
and you should have gone before.

01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:02.430
Come here.

01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:08.070
Come here.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.229
I can't bend my thing.

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:12.430
Come here.

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:15.470
Come here.

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:20.148
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:28:20.150 --> 01:28:21.750
I'm sorry.

01:28:26.989 --> 01:28:29.189
I'm sleepy.

01:29:42.869 --> 01:29:44.910
Bye, Bob!

01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:39.229
Oh, God.

01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:09.070
Here, let me do that.

01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:16.270
Are you gonna carry on like this?

01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:20.950
I thought I might, yeah.

01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:29.989
You are gonna drink yourself to death.

01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:35.830
- Give it me!
- Well, I was born in a storm, wun't I?

01:31:42.390 --> 01:31:44.670
It's bloody cold in here, Mam.

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:48.070
It's cold everywhere.

01:31:49.950 --> 01:31:51.910
You're like a little bird.

01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:05.908
- I wanna do something for you.
- Do you?

01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:07.670
Yeah, I do.

01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:16.750
I know it's not been... Right.

01:32:17.869 --> 01:32:19.390
Us.

01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:22.510
And I know you don't like to talk.

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:28.629
But I want to take you to the coast...

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:30.790
...to live.

01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:34.150
If you like.

01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:38.270
I'll buy you a place.

01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:46.470
I've been no... Kind of a mother.

01:32:57.030 --> 01:33:01.869
No. I'll only drink meself... Stupid.

01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:07.189
Aye, well, you can do it
under a big sky, can't you?

01:33:09.629 --> 01:33:12.508
I'm so sorry, love.

01:33:17.150 --> 01:33:19.030
What are we like, eh?

01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:48.510
You might be happy now.

01:33:49.390 --> 01:33:51.390
I might be.

01:33:54.270 --> 01:33:56.350
Why did you put up with it?

01:33:58.030 --> 01:34:00.270
'Cause I didn't know any better.

01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:03.390
You should have got out.

01:34:04.670 --> 01:34:08.350
Should'a... Could'a, didn't.

01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:15.150
You saw him hitting me, Mum.

01:34:20.830 --> 01:34:22.430
I were only little.

01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:25.590
It wasn't right.

01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:30.590
Can't be helped now.

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:36.189
No.

01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.950
When I was a kid...

01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:49.910
I dreamt I was flying.

01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:53.350
Flying over Salisbury Plain.

01:34:54.869 --> 01:34:57.229
I didn't know it was Salisbury Plain
till I grew up.

01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:02.910
It was a beautiful sunny day.

01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:05.670
The wind was stinging me face...

01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:08.750
Pulling me mouth open.

01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:15.790
But it was a memory.

01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:19.030
Not a dream.

01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:22.110
I was flying.

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:25.229
And I know that isn't right.

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:29.629
But it's true.

01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:33.629
I was flying.

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:37.270
See, I've lived my whole life
knowing I can fly.

01:35:38.869 --> 01:35:40.550
It's what's kept me up.

01:35:42.030 --> 01:35:43.390
Lifted me up.

01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:41.510
You see, it's always been
too much for me, life.

01:36:42.750 --> 01:36:45.869
Too much and not enough...

01:36:47.869 --> 01:36:49.910
All at the same time.

01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:58.470
Listen to me going on, eh?

01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:28.734
