00:20.056 --> 00:21.626
[Rachel]
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.660 --> 00:24.394
[priest] Ashes to ashes,
dust to dust.

00:24.428 --> 00:27.699
Living with Bruce Wayne
is gonna change
your life forever.

00:27.731 --> 00:29.300
-[Dick] <i>I'm searching.
-[Becky] </i> <i>For what?</i>

00:29.300 --> 00:31.068
-Who killed my parents.
-The police are doing their--

00:31.068 --> 00:32.369
I have to be the one
who finds them!

00:32.369 --> 00:33.970
-Why?
-So I can kill them.

00:34.005 --> 00:35.707
[screaming]

00:35.740 --> 00:37.709
[Dr. Adamson] What's he seeing
on the hallucinogens?

00:37.709 --> 00:39.643
The deepest,
darkest parts of himself.

00:39.677 --> 00:41.411
How long till
he's fully cooked?

00:41.411 --> 00:42.746
-Within an hour.
-[man continues screaming]

00:42.746 --> 00:43.682
Good.

00:43.682 --> 00:45.950
<i>I want Dad
to meet his new family.</i>

00:45.982 --> 00:47.451
Honey, I'm home.

00:47.484 --> 00:50.021
When I was in Detroit,
I was planning
on leaving Robin behind.

00:50.054 --> 00:52.122
-Why?
-When I put on that mask,

00:52.155 --> 00:53.691
<i>I become someone
I can't control.</i>

00:53.723 --> 00:55.058
I want my parents back!

00:55.091 --> 00:56.661
[Kory] What happened to him?

00:56.695 --> 00:58.697
[Dick]<i>He said he works
</i> <i>for something called
</i> <i>the Organization.</i>

00:58.729 --> 01:00.298
<i>And they work
for Rachel's father.</i>

01:00.331 --> 01:01.799
He seemed to have
people everywhere.

01:01.832 --> 01:06.832
-It's time to talk.
-I'm not talking
to anyone but Rachel.

01:33.463 --> 01:35.599
[Rachel] I need
to talk to him. Alone.

01:35.632 --> 01:37.100
-[Dick] Don't think
that's a good idea.
-Why?

01:37.134 --> 01:38.503
'Cause I can't take care
of myself?

01:38.536 --> 01:40.938
-That's not the point.
-I need to find out who he is.

01:40.971 --> 01:42.439
Why he's chasing me.

01:42.439 --> 01:44.676
-I don't trust him.
-What's not to trust?
The man's tied up.

01:44.709 --> 01:47.278
One word from Rachel,
and I'll walk in and put
my foot through his face.

01:47.311 --> 01:51.548
Dick, please.

01:51.581 --> 01:53.683
[Dick sighs]

01:53.716 --> 01:56.153
Five minutes.

01:56.186 --> 01:57.686
Thank you.

02:06.730 --> 02:07.930
Come in.

02:12.735 --> 02:15.205
Child.

02:15.239 --> 02:19.776
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

02:19.810 --> 02:22.979
Close the door.

02:23.013 --> 02:24.062
Please?

02:32.657 --> 02:37.306
We have waited
a very long time

02:37.828 --> 02:41.231
for this moment.

02:41.264 --> 02:43.766
What do you want from me?

02:43.800 --> 02:47.070
To help you.

02:47.104 --> 02:48.840
You think you're a monster.

02:48.872 --> 02:53.872
That there's evil inside you
scratching to get out.

02:55.378 --> 03:00.378
You see it each time
you look in a mirror.

03:01.050 --> 03:04.489
In your dreams.

03:04.521 --> 03:09.021
But you are not death, Rachel.

03:11.127 --> 03:15.800
Quite the opposite.

03:15.834 --> 03:20.834
You were not placed
on this Earth to destroy,

03:22.705 --> 03:24.506
but to heal.

03:31.181 --> 03:32.831
To save us.

03:38.122 --> 03:40.222
I'll prove it.

03:52.402 --> 03:57.402
Put your hands
on this rended flesh.

03:58.842 --> 04:00.211
Save me!

04:00.243 --> 04:02.079
[grunts]

04:02.112 --> 04:03.413
No!

04:03.448 --> 04:04.481
[hyperventilating]

04:04.514 --> 04:08.218
-[groaning]
-[grunting]

04:08.252 --> 04:11.822
[hyperventilating]

04:11.854 --> 04:13.022
[screams]

04:13.056 --> 04:17.228
[panting]

04:17.261 --> 04:18.829
[skin squelching]

04:18.862 --> 04:20.362
[wheezing]

04:33.877 --> 04:35.226
[gasping]

04:47.492 --> 04:51.091
You will heal the world.

05:03.574 --> 05:06.723
[theme music playing]

05:18.689 --> 05:20.658
How did you know
she could do that?

05:20.692 --> 05:22.392
[Dr. Adamson]
I know everything about her.

05:22.425 --> 05:27.232
She will purify the world.

05:27.264 --> 05:30.434
There's a prophecy that says
Rachel will destroy the world.

05:30.468 --> 05:33.370
An interpretation
based on fear.

05:33.403 --> 05:34.437
[grunts]

05:34.471 --> 05:36.374
What do you want with Rachel?

05:36.406 --> 05:40.978
She will purify the world.
[grunting]

05:41.011 --> 05:42.112
[screaming]

05:42.146 --> 05:44.247
I'm not gonna ask you again.

05:44.281 --> 05:46.783
To reunite her
with her father.

05:46.817 --> 05:48.285
[grunting]

05:48.319 --> 05:50.221
[panting]

05:50.254 --> 05:52.189
Who is he? Where is he?

05:52.223 --> 05:54.324
I don't know. I swear.

05:54.358 --> 05:55.459
[groans]

05:55.492 --> 05:56.526
[grunts]

05:56.560 --> 05:59.329
You can't stop him.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.833
Angela couldn't.
Melissa couldn't.

06:01.865 --> 06:05.269
No one can keep
Rachel from him.

06:05.302 --> 06:06.571
Who's Angela?

06:06.603 --> 06:09.973
[Dr. Adamson grunts,
panting]

06:10.007 --> 06:13.610
You said she couldn't
keep Rachel from him.

06:13.644 --> 06:16.213
Who is Angela?

06:16.247 --> 06:19.850
[groans]

06:19.882 --> 06:22.985
Her mother.

06:23.019 --> 06:26.557
Angela is her mother.

06:26.591 --> 06:29.225
Now we're getting somewhere.

06:29.259 --> 06:31.394
Let's talk about Angela.

06:31.428 --> 06:34.163
-[bones cracking]
-[screaming in pain]

06:34.197 --> 06:35.997
[door shuts]

06:43.507 --> 06:44.557
[sighs]

06:49.814 --> 06:53.283
He says your birth mother
is still alive.

06:53.317 --> 06:55.521
What?

06:55.553 --> 07:00.225
He claims they've been
holding her prisoner.
He may be lying.

07:00.257 --> 07:04.095
He says your mother's name
is Angela Azarath.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.598
They're holding her
at some asylum.

07:06.632 --> 07:11.632
Apparently, he and his people
are dead set on keeping
you two apart.

07:13.103 --> 07:15.040
Why?

07:15.040 --> 07:18.475
Some more blabber about
Rachel's father
and his divine mission.

07:18.509 --> 07:19.644
I don't know.

07:19.677 --> 07:22.814
Sounds like
your mother isn't a fan.

07:22.846 --> 07:27.846
My mom's alive.
I could meet my mom.

07:28.351 --> 07:30.055
We have to go. Now.

07:30.088 --> 07:33.858
Even if he is telling
the truth,
this could be a trap.

07:33.858 --> 07:36.026
At best, we would be marching
into an enemy stronghold.

07:36.026 --> 07:37.495
You've seen what
these people can do.

07:37.495 --> 07:40.064
No one's going anywhere
until we take some time
for recon.

07:40.098 --> 07:42.000
What if they move her?
They know we have him.

07:42.033 --> 07:46.603
I'm not risking
all of our lives
on his word.

07:46.637 --> 07:47.738
I'm sorry.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.375
Tell him he's wrong.

07:50.408 --> 07:54.144
I wish I could.
You know how I hate
to agree with him, but--

07:54.178 --> 07:59.178
All you ever talk about
is finding out who you are.

08:01.052 --> 08:06.052
You think we should go.
Right, Gar?

08:06.357 --> 08:08.358
Gar?

08:08.391 --> 08:11.091
I'm sorry, Rachel.

08:23.507 --> 08:24.557
Rachel.

08:36.386 --> 08:40.323
[rhythmic knocking]

08:40.356 --> 08:42.759
Go away.

08:42.793 --> 08:46.094
Can I come in? Please?

08:48.466 --> 08:53.303
[sighs]

08:53.336 --> 08:56.774
So, you can heal people?

08:56.807 --> 09:00.745
Maybe. I think so.
Like you care.

09:00.778 --> 09:02.913
-Rachel--
-I can't believe
you're on their side.

09:02.947 --> 09:05.682
Of all people, I thought
you would understand.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.552
Ever since my mom...

09:07.586 --> 09:12.523
Ever since Melissa died,
I've been alone.
I don't have anyone.

09:12.556 --> 09:16.626
You've got us.

09:16.660 --> 09:21.030
You know what I mean, right?

09:21.063 --> 09:24.067
Yeah, I do.

09:24.101 --> 09:27.370
If I had even
the slightest chance
of getting my mom back,

09:27.403 --> 09:29.606
there's nothing I wouldn't do.

09:29.639 --> 09:32.909
-But you said--
-Yeah, I lied.

09:32.943 --> 09:36.047
I just said
what they wanted to hear.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.049
You get pretty good at that
when you live
with Dr. Caulder.

09:39.082 --> 09:43.888
If you agree with people,
they tend to leave you alone.
[chuckles]

09:43.921 --> 09:47.692
-So...
-I'll go with you.

09:47.725 --> 09:50.594
If your mom's there,
we'll find her.

09:50.628 --> 09:54.164
And, uh,

09:54.198 --> 09:59.198
I'm thinking...
[whispers] We go in style.

10:00.038 --> 10:03.506
[Dick] Public records show
that the facility where
Rachel's mom is being held

10:03.541 --> 10:04.875
is closed and abandoned.

10:04.908 --> 10:07.477
Doesn't look
like either one to me.

10:07.510 --> 10:08.846
Nope.

10:08.879 --> 10:10.581
Fourteen monitored exits.

10:10.615 --> 10:13.719
All hooked up to CCTV
and IR sensors.

10:13.751 --> 10:17.587
Thermal scans showing upwards
of ten security staff
patrolling on the inside.

10:17.587 --> 10:19.224
No heat signatures
on the outer buildings,

10:19.224 --> 10:21.392
but another dozen
are patrolling the grounds.

10:21.424 --> 10:24.629
Okay.

10:24.662 --> 10:27.231
So, option one,

10:27.264 --> 10:30.167
we walk up and
knock on the door.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.169
Option two,

10:32.202 --> 10:35.306
I blow down the door.
Or option three...

10:35.339 --> 10:37.509
Tunnels.

10:37.542 --> 10:40.445
Connecting the main asylum
to the decommissioned
outbuildings.

10:40.479 --> 10:42.879
We use them
to get past
the ground patrols.

10:42.913 --> 10:46.017
Once inside, we'd still be
pretty heavily outnumbered.

10:46.049 --> 10:49.200
But I've faced worse.

11:15.812 --> 11:17.013
Damn it!

11:23.022 --> 11:27.591
You know, it's, like,
a federal offense to use
someone else's Uber account.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.592
No, it's not.

11:29.626 --> 11:32.330
Even so,
Kory may kick your ass.

11:32.364 --> 11:35.231
-Uh... You'll protect me.
-Is that so?

11:35.264 --> 11:38.836
Yeah, it is.

11:38.870 --> 11:42.907
[sighs]

11:42.940 --> 11:47.940
I wonder
how long they've had her.

11:48.111 --> 11:53.111
Could be why
she never came
looking for you.

11:54.184 --> 11:57.955
I wonder
if she'll even recognize me.

11:57.989 --> 12:00.524
Mothers always do.
It's like with animals.

12:00.558 --> 12:04.662
Mother wolves always know
their offspring
by their scent.

12:04.695 --> 12:07.544
You saying I smell?

12:17.676 --> 12:21.346
I think we'll have to try
the south entrance
away from the guards.

12:21.379 --> 12:24.448
-I don't think
it's a safe bet, but--
-But what?

12:24.481 --> 12:29.481
I mean, we came this far,
right? Be stupid
to back out now.

12:32.990 --> 12:35.960
-So, which way?
-Uh...

12:35.993 --> 12:38.692
[sighs] After you.

12:47.071 --> 12:51.575
[Gar] Oh, I can't believe
we're doing this.

12:51.609 --> 12:55.113
So, do you think she's my mom?

12:55.145 --> 12:56.880
-[buzzing]
-[Gar grunts]

12:56.913 --> 12:57.964
[gasps]

13:12.831 --> 13:16.234
What are the chances
our two geniuses
haven't gotten caught yet?

13:16.267 --> 13:19.769
Next security sweep
is in ten minutes.

13:19.803 --> 13:21.153
Let's go.

13:49.400 --> 13:54.400
Left when we get
to the end of the tunnel.

14:02.211 --> 14:04.115
Gar!

14:04.148 --> 14:08.852
[doctor] Don't worry.
He's just taking a little nap.

14:08.885 --> 14:11.855
Dick.

14:11.889 --> 14:14.292
-We've got the girl, too.
-[gun cocks]

14:14.325 --> 14:17.128
I don't want to kill
either of them,

14:17.160 --> 14:22.160
but if you make a move,
I will give the order.

14:24.067 --> 14:26.971
Kory, wait.

14:27.004 --> 14:31.953
Gas lines.
You'll burn us all up.

14:49.259 --> 14:52.110
[breathing heavily]

15:00.604 --> 15:01.653
[sighs]

15:12.048 --> 15:13.249
[grunts]

15:18.054 --> 15:22.826
Hello, Mr. Grayson.

15:22.860 --> 15:25.196
<i>Please relax, Mr. Grayson.</i>

15:25.229 --> 15:27.932
I think you'll find it
will go easier if you do.

15:27.965 --> 15:30.168
Where's Rachel?
If you've hurt her--

15:30.201 --> 15:32.769
<i>No one is getting hurt.
Quite the opposite.</i>

15:32.802 --> 15:34.304
We're here to help.

15:34.339 --> 15:39.339
We're going to give you
something to help you
settle down.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.614
What the fuck is that?
What is that?

15:42.647 --> 15:46.750
Don't you fucking touch me!
Don't you fucking dare touch--

15:46.783 --> 15:48.283
[exclaims]

16:03.399 --> 16:04.399
Hey!

16:19.549 --> 16:23.854
[grunting]

16:23.888 --> 16:25.238
[panting]

16:30.927 --> 16:32.128
[grunts]

16:40.870 --> 16:43.642
Let me out of here!

16:43.674 --> 16:48.674
Do you hear me?
I know you hear me!
Let me out!

16:51.081 --> 16:53.049
[doctor] Shouldn't be
long now.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.484
[computer beeps]

17:10.867 --> 17:14.468
She's depleted. Proceed.

17:21.077 --> 17:22.577
[coughing]

17:40.431 --> 17:44.030
-Again.
-[Gar screaming]

17:45.569 --> 17:50.375
Now, now, Garfield.
Stop resisting.

17:50.407 --> 17:55.246
All that we want is
for you to show us
what you are.

17:55.278 --> 17:57.080
[screaming]

17:57.114 --> 17:59.349
[panting]

17:59.384 --> 18:01.920
Whoa!
Oh, that felt good!

18:01.952 --> 18:06.952
[Dr. Adamson] Don't worry.
It's going to get much,
much better.

18:08.226 --> 18:09.875
[screaming]

18:22.038 --> 18:26.538

You may be inclined

keeping her alive.

lead us to you.
