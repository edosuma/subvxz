PlCARD:
Captain's log, stardate 42859.2.

00:07.257 --> 00:11.427
We're in orbit around Antede lll,
awaiting the arrival of two dignitaries.

00:11.636 --> 00:15.139
Our mission is to escort them
to a conference on planet Pacifica,

00:15.348 --> 00:18.976
where they will be given
the opportunity to join the Federation.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.441
l thought you might find this
interesting, Mr. Crusher.

00:25.650 --> 00:29.403
Few humans have seen an Antedean
in the flesh.

00:35.910 --> 00:37.036
Welcome.

00:37.245 --> 00:41.206
l'm Jean-Luc Picard,
captain of the Enterprise.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.634
- Are they all right, sir?
- Yes.

00:52.844 --> 00:55.554
This is their preferred way
of space travel.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.390
PULASKl: Their physical condition
is good enough,

00:58.600 --> 01:01.018
considering the circumstances.

01:01.227 --> 01:04.021
lt is a self-induced catatonic state.

01:04.647 --> 01:08.609
Their way of dealing
with the trauma of space flight.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.486
Will we try to revive them?

01:10.695 --> 01:14.698
No, not until we reach the Pacifica
conference three days from now.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.950
Doctor, have you prepared
a Sickbay facility

01:17.160 --> 01:18.660
to accommodate our guests?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.454
As soon as l can make
some adjustments.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.207
Their physiology is unusual.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.042
You can store them
for a few hours?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.086
Sure. l'll have them kept here,
out of the way.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.589
- Mr. Worf, provide security.
WORF: Aye, sir.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.592
What's in that container?

01:34.260 --> 01:37.387
Vermicula. lt's their food.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.016
When they come out of stasis,
they'll be very hungry.

01:43.061 --> 01:46.563
- They eat this?
- ln great quantities.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.321
What a handsome race.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.998
So, what did you think
of the Antedeans, Wesley?

02:05.291 --> 02:08.752
They are rather strange-looking,
commander.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.754
Judging a being
by its physical appearance

02:10.964 --> 02:13.632
is the last major human prejudice,
Wesley.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.676
The point is well-taken, Mr. Data.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.971
l'm sure that to the Antedeans
we are equally unattractive.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.597
Captain, we're being hailed

02:20.807 --> 02:23.559
by a small transport vessel
just coming into range.

02:23.768 --> 02:24.935
Oh, my God.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.689
What's the problem?

02:29.899 --> 02:31.275
TROl:
What's she doing here?

02:31.484 --> 02:32.526
WESLEY:
On-screen, captain.

02:32.735 --> 02:34.069
Starship Enterprise, come in.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.071
PlCARD:
We have you on viewer, pilot.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.865
Enterprise, I have a passenger.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.908
A VlP passenger
who l'm ordered to take--

02:40.118 --> 02:43.412
Oh, let me talk to them.
l'm sure l'm more articulate than that.

02:43.746 --> 02:44.788
Mother.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.709
Captain, we are receiving
Starfleet orders granting a Lwaxana--

02:48.918 --> 02:51.587
Lwaxana Troi,
daughter of the Fifth House,

02:51.796 --> 02:56.592
holder of the sacred Chalice of Rixx,
heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.844
--full ambassadorial status, sir.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.221
lt looks like it's back
into that dress uniform, sir.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.015
And yours as well, commander.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.392
She is listed as representing
the Betazed government

03:05.602 --> 03:06.643
at the conference.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.062
Mother, please, don't do this to me.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.231
LWAXANA:
Do what to you, little one?

03:11.691 --> 03:16.361
Oh, Jean-Luc,
what naughty thoughts.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.782
But how wonderful
you still think of me like that.

03:42.931 --> 03:47.226
PlCARD:
Space, the final frontier.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.730
These are the voyages
ofthe starship Enterprise.

03:51.940 --> 03:57.069
lts continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,

03:57.695 --> 04:01.865
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

04:02.283 --> 04:06.703
to boldly go where no one
has gone before.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.516
lt's so like my mother
to do the unexpected.

05:09.726 --> 05:15.814
Oh, it will be pleasant to have her
as a guest of the Enterprise again.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.567
Energize.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.576
LWAXANA:
Legs! Where are the legs?

05:28.036 --> 05:30.746
Where they belong, Mother.
Right under you.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.539
Oh, l hate that.

05:32.749 --> 05:36.209
l will never completely trust
this device, Jean-Luc.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.462
Captain Picard, Mother.

05:38.838 --> 05:39.838
[GASPS]

05:42.133 --> 05:43.175
Explain to her.

05:43.384 --> 05:46.553
RlKER: l'm sorry they startled you,
Mrs. Troi. They're Antedean delegates.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.221
They're being stored here
temporarily.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.723
Delegates?

05:49.932 --> 05:52.934
Last time l saw something like that,
it was being served on a plate.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.815
Oh, darling.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.818
Ah.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.612
Well, well, well.

06:03.821 --> 06:07.282
And you, Jean-Luc, l wasn't aware
you had such handsome legs.

06:07.825 --> 06:12.412
My valet is waiting.
You may beam him aboard now.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.294
You remember Mr. Homn, of course.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.588
lt would be hard to forget Mr. Homn.

06:22.173 --> 06:25.425
l retained his services despite
the outlandishly lustful thoughts

06:25.635 --> 06:27.302
he spews in my direction.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.970
You can put that down, Homn.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.767
We can't deny the captain the honor
of carrying my belongings.

06:33.976 --> 06:37.145
l will not interfere
with Mr. Homn's duties this time.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.273
Oh, now that's not
what you're really thinking, Jean-Luc.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.651
You forget l'm a telepath.

06:42.860 --> 06:47.030
Mrs. Troi, since this is obviously
significant to you,

06:50.326 --> 06:51.868
l'll...

06:56.791 --> 06:58.458
l'll carry it.

07:00.461 --> 07:01.878
[GRUNTS]

07:07.552 --> 07:10.053
Just down this corridor.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.433
LWAXANA: He has nice legs too,
little one. ls he still yours?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.686
TROI: Humans no longer own
each other that way, Mother.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.729
Really?

07:20.815 --> 07:24.234
That's a custom
we may have to introduce again.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.283
Thank you.

07:31.492 --> 07:33.410
Glad to help.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.416
Well, l trust
you will be comfortable here.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.543
- lf you will excuse me.
LWAXANA: Uh...

07:41.711 --> 07:45.881
l am serving a Betazoid dinner
of greeting tonight, captain.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.633
lt is an ambassadorial function.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.886
lt sounds delightful.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.850
He's a fine man.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.353
Solid. Reliable.

08:01.772 --> 08:06.276
He's a little bit on the stuffy side
but, all in all, he's not that bad.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.611
l can't believe you, Mother.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.572
You sound like
you're sizing up a commodity.

08:10.781 --> 08:15.827
But that's exactly what men are,
darling, especially human men.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.080
Was your father ever unhappy
with me?

08:19.290 --> 08:22.501
No. He worshiped you.

08:22.710 --> 08:25.879
But l don't think l'll ever learn
to see men the way you do.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.758
You will as you mature, darling.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.887
And the men in your life
are going to bless you for it.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.890
You're so beautiful.

08:39.143 --> 08:43.188
Then she actually complimented
Captain Picard on his legs?

08:43.397 --> 08:45.941
l would have thought a telepath
would be more discreet, sir.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.193
RlKER: Exactly the opposite.
She knows what's on your mind,

08:48.402 --> 08:51.029
and she lets you know
what's on hers.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.615

Gentlemen.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.206
l think we must not lose sight
of the fact

09:01.415 --> 09:02.749
that we are talking about someone

09:02.959 --> 09:05.418
who has been granted
ambassadorial rank.

09:05.628 --> 09:09.548
Even though she may appear
somewhat eccentric,

09:09.757 --> 09:12.717
Lwaxana Troi must be treated
with the appropriate respect.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.636
ls that understood?

09:17.890 --> 09:18.890
Picard to Pulaski.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.308
PULASKl [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Yes, captain.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.311
When did you last look in
on the Antedean guests?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.272
Doing so right now, captain.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.274
Are they still catatonic?

09:27.483 --> 09:30.443
Status of the beings is unchanged.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.531
Pulse still steady.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.535
Respiration, normal for them.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.454
Understood. Keep me informed.
Picard out.

09:41.664 --> 09:43.707
l'll be in my quarters.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.294
lt will be a dress-uniform dinner,
gentlemen.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.795
Sir?

09:52.383 --> 09:55.552
To which dinner
was the captain referring, sir?

09:55.886 --> 09:59.055
Nothing l've been invited to.
Any of you?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.814
Very interesting.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.371
You're not attending the dinner

Well, l've already eaten

The other officers?

11:51.293 --> 11:53.461
Hello, Jean-Luc.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.341
So glad you could come.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.859
A toast, to Earth men,
who, despite their many faults,

12:16.026 --> 12:19.446
have that unique ability
to charm women of all races

12:19.613 --> 12:22.741
in all corners of the galaxy.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.619
Speaking on behalf of men of Earth,

12:26.829 --> 12:30.415
which is indeed an awesome
responsibility, l thank you.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.344
l know what you're thinking, captain.

12:43.554 --> 12:44.721
You do?

12:45.097 --> 12:50.226
You're wondering whether l'm seeing
any other men on a serious basis.

12:50.436 --> 12:52.312
Well, actually, l wasn't...

12:52.521 --> 12:54.731
l wouldn't worry about it, Jean-Luc.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.945
Competition seems to bring out
the best in the human male.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.995
The fact is, l, um...

13:10.706 --> 13:13.583
l was not expecting this setting.

13:13.793 --> 13:17.337
l had assumed that my senior
Bridge officers would be attending.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.341
You never assume anything
where Lwaxana Troi is concerned.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.804
Betazoid women
are full of surprises.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.144
Oh, strange.

13:35.105 --> 13:37.982
l'm not really very hungry tonight.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.236
l wonder
what's made me lose my appetite.

[GONG CHlMES]

Of course.
You're giving thanks for your food.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.831
l had forgotten about that.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.503
l wonder how many other cultures
have similar customs.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.548
l don't know.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.635
Well, let's find out.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.845
Commander Data?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.346
DATA [OVER lNTERCOM]:
Yes, captain?

14:08.514 --> 14:11.850
Mrs. Troi and l are having
a very interesting discussion

14:12.059 --> 14:16.437
about various societies' ways
of giving thanks.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.399
The Betazoids' use of the chime,
for instance.

14:19.608 --> 14:23.444
DATA: The use of the chime is
quite unique but not at all dissimilar

14:23.612 --> 14:26.781
to the Oolans of Marejaretus Vl,
who use two large stones

14:26.991 --> 14:29.450
which are continuously struck together
during the meal.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.328
Those at the dinner must eat
until the stones are broken.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.123
Or the oligarchy at Atifs lV
which requires a--

14:35.291 --> 14:39.127
Data, this is fascinating.
Don't you agree, Mrs. Troi?

14:39.336 --> 14:43.298
Commander, if your duties permit,
why don't you join us for dessert?

14:43.507 --> 14:46.175
l'm sure that Mrs. Troi
would much appreciate

14:46.385 --> 14:48.428
- the pleasure of your company.
- What?

14:48.637 --> 14:52.348
lndeed, sir. l'm on my way. Data out.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.601
How could you possibly think

14:54.810 --> 14:56.811
l would wanna share
our special time together

14:57.021 --> 14:59.606
with that robot of yours?

14:59.815 --> 15:03.443
Because of Data's
wonderful after-dinner conversation.

15:03.652 --> 15:07.322
His anecdotes are the stuff of legends
aboard this ship.

15:09.825 --> 15:11.993
So by using the square root of pi,

15:12.202 --> 15:14.287
and multiplying it by nine
to the third power,

15:14.496 --> 15:16.915
l was able
to accurately calculate the distance

15:17.124 --> 15:19.626
between the Omicron system
and the Crab Nebula.

15:19.793 --> 15:22.003
Oh. Ah.

15:22.171 --> 15:27.759
Fascinating, Data.
Absolutely fascinating.

15:28.886 --> 15:32.138
l'm sure Mrs. Troi would love
to hear the one

15:32.348 --> 15:39.979
about the anomalous chemical
composition of, um, brown dwarf stars.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.940
- Not really.
- Yes, captain.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.859
That is a particularly
spellbinding subject.

15:45.069 --> 15:48.488
ln most stars,
the rare Earth element europium

15:48.697 --> 15:51.366
is enriched relative
to samarium and gadolinium.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.077
- That so?
- lt is. However...

15:54.286 --> 15:57.163
Your mother seems
quite an interesting woman, Deanna.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.707
Hm. Perhaps l should
tell you something

15:59.917 --> 16:02.001
about my mother's condition
at this time.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.586
Condition at this time?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.839
lt's something that occurs
to Betazed females

16:07.049 --> 16:08.841
as they enter mid-life.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.635
We call it the Phase.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.763
Mid-life
as in a human female's menopause?

16:13.973 --> 16:19.310
Similar. lt's only at mid-life
that a Betazoid female becomes,

16:19.520 --> 16:22.814
well, fully sexual,
if you know what l mean.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.233
Yes, l think l do.

16:25.442 --> 16:29.570
l also think that l saw the captain
on his way to her quarters.
