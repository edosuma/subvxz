WEBVTT

00:05.719 --> 00:07.487
Ow.

00:09.390 --> 00:12.092
Question is... what happened
to your parry cut?

00:15.796 --> 00:17.430
My hand's cramping.

00:17.497 --> 00:19.666
Okay. Let me take a look.

00:19.733 --> 00:21.200
No. No, don't make this about me.

00:21.268 --> 00:23.302
Please just tell me... tell me
what's going on with you.

00:23.370 --> 00:25.805
- Nothing.
- You're so intense,

00:25.873 --> 00:26.995
and the whole point of fencing

00:27.066 --> 00:28.801
is to relax before your big surgery.

00:28.869 --> 00:29.961
I'm completely relaxed.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.610
You just said you were excited.

00:31.678 --> 00:33.446
- En garde!
- Shahir!

00:33.513 --> 00:35.814
Talk to me.

00:39.052 --> 00:41.987
Alex, have you ever been in love, hmm?

00:42.055 --> 00:44.723
Where it's hopeless, impossible even?

00:44.791 --> 00:46.892
Shahir, nothing's hopeless.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.695
He's married, and he's straight.

00:50.801 --> 00:51.930
Okay.

00:51.998 --> 00:54.399
So, you have a crush on someone...

00:54.467 --> 00:57.035
This isn't some crush.
I've never felt this way.

00:57.103 --> 00:59.104
You know, I can't eat. I can't sleep.

00:59.171 --> 01:01.039
I can't even breathe. It's awful.

01:01.107 --> 01:03.041
Yeah.

01:03.109 --> 01:05.009
That's love.

01:05.077 --> 01:06.777
Okay, so, what do I do about it?

01:06.845 --> 01:09.380
I wish I knew.

01:13.252 --> 01:16.387
Charlie, just imagine...

01:16.455 --> 01:18.823
you and me having a baby.

01:18.890 --> 01:21.058
Dawn, we just started...

01:21.126 --> 01:22.226
Hooking up.

01:22.293 --> 01:24.328
I know that's what it is. I...

01:24.395 --> 01:27.865
I'm not asking you to commit
to me in any way. I just...

01:27.933 --> 01:30.768
Want me to impregnate you?

01:30.836 --> 01:32.336
Well, you make it sound so clinical.

01:32.403 --> 01:33.504
Oh, I'm making it sound clinical?

01:33.571 --> 01:36.473
I'm not asking you to co-parent.

01:36.541 --> 01:40.910
Uh, did you ever think that
maybe I'd want to co-parent?

01:40.978 --> 01:44.714
You would be a great dad.

01:44.782 --> 01:48.185
And I know that I would be a good mom.

01:50.054 --> 01:52.756
Now is the time for you to agree with me.

01:52.823 --> 01:55.291
- What do you want me to do, Dawn?
- Just...

01:56.042 --> 01:59.162
you know, I want you
to do what you've been doing.

02:06.336 --> 02:09.104
And... go see Dr. Katz.

02:09.173 --> 02:11.006
What?!

02:11.074 --> 02:13.042
What? I can't leave anything to chance.

02:13.109 --> 02:15.645
Dawn, I'm gonna need a little
time to think about this.

02:15.712 --> 02:17.480
Absolutely.

02:18.196 --> 02:20.650
I made you an appointment for 11:00.

02:24.655 --> 02:25.628
Hey, did you think,

02:25.678 --> 02:27.355
uh, Verlander's lost velocity
on his fastball?

02:27.423 --> 02:28.590
He's pitching like he has.

02:28.658 --> 02:29.655
Why, is he on your fantasy ball team?

02:29.713 --> 02:31.056
Yeah. He cost me half my payroll,

02:31.142 --> 02:32.984
and you and Reycraft still got
all the good players.

02:33.034 --> 02:34.879
My advice is dump his ass.
So, what do we got?

02:34.994 --> 02:37.599
Guy was texting and walked
in front of a streetcar.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.034
He's got a shattered pelvis,

02:39.102 --> 02:40.803
severed left leg, massive internal bleeding.

02:42.105 --> 02:43.672
And that would be...?

02:43.739 --> 02:45.073
The least of his problems.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.652 --> 02:58.720
Come on.

03:01.824 --> 03:04.325
Okay, this is getting
way out of hand, sister.

03:04.392 --> 03:07.061
- What?
- Every time I look at you, you're suturing.

03:07.129 --> 03:08.529
I'm practicing.

03:08.597 --> 03:09.864
Which means Shahir asked you

03:09.932 --> 03:11.799
to assist on his omentum surgery,

03:11.867 --> 03:14.268
which means you're gonna put in
a good word for me.

03:14.336 --> 03:15.636
Nope.

03:15.704 --> 03:17.271
Harsh.

03:17.339 --> 03:18.439
He asked Reycraft.

03:18.506 --> 03:20.207
The surgery is so experimental,

03:20.275 --> 03:22.443
Dawn insisted it needed a staff surgeon.

03:22.510 --> 03:25.979
Well, that sucks.

03:28.717 --> 03:31.619
At least I didn't find you
sexy-skyping with Joel again.

03:31.686 --> 03:33.987
New Zealand's a 16-hour time difference,

03:34.055 --> 03:35.956
and it was just regular skyping.

03:36.023 --> 03:39.126
Mm-hmm. In a slinky negligee?

03:39.193 --> 03:41.561
In my room, which is private... roomie.

03:41.629 --> 03:45.065
You know, I might have
some skirts you could hem.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.133
Go.

03:54.541 --> 03:55.642
Any medications?

03:55.709 --> 03:57.900
- Statin. It's for high cholesterol.
- Statin's okay.

03:57.993 --> 03:59.925
Have you ever been under
a general anesthetic?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.945
Yes, and no complications.

04:02.028 --> 04:04.067
I think that's enough questions, yeah?

04:04.163 --> 04:06.351
Oh, he's just going
through the checklist, sir...

04:06.419 --> 04:08.687
which, legend has it, you wrote.

04:08.755 --> 04:10.792
Great to see you, Thomas.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.365
Hey. Now get this appendix

04:13.415 --> 04:14.593
the hell out of me before it blows.

04:14.661 --> 04:15.928
All right. Let me have a feel.

04:15.996 --> 04:17.696
Okay.

04:17.764 --> 04:19.012
Oh, god.

04:19.105 --> 04:20.531
Sam taught me first year.

04:20.807 --> 04:23.034
The reason I became a surgeon.

04:23.102 --> 04:24.670
Well, I don't know about that.

04:24.737 --> 04:25.937
Well, it's a pleasure, Dr. Campbell.

04:26.005 --> 04:28.707
All right, if we're done, I'm dying here.

04:28.775 --> 04:30.175
Let's 'scope this sucker.

04:30.242 --> 04:31.443
Uh, you know what?

04:31.511 --> 04:33.412
I'm afraid I can't go in laparoscopically.

04:33.479 --> 04:35.980
Damn. It's the scarring, right?

04:36.048 --> 04:38.450
Well, you know what?
It's like you always say...

04:38.518 --> 04:40.251
it takes a knife to save a life.

04:40.319 --> 04:44.022
Student becomes the teacher.

04:44.089 --> 04:45.032
I'll see you in there, okay?

04:45.097 --> 04:46.641
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:47.226 --> 04:49.794
Give me that.

04:49.862 --> 04:52.170
You were lucky to have had a mentor.

04:52.252 --> 04:56.204
Yeah. But I did a lousy job of keeping up.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.469
Ah, never too late, my friend.

05:00.339 --> 05:02.206
Scissors. Thank you.

05:05.677 --> 05:07.878
- Good cut.
- Thank you.

05:07.946 --> 05:10.781
Yeah, before I did
my general rotation with Sam,

05:10.849 --> 05:11.982
I thought I'd be a G.P.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.450
Okay.

05:13.517 --> 05:15.118
Suture this base.

05:15.186 --> 05:16.786
4-0 suture?

05:16.855 --> 05:18.155
No. 3.

05:18.223 --> 05:19.760
Forceps.

05:20.791 --> 05:25.095
Yeah, so, uh... so, what happened?

05:25.163 --> 05:27.030
Ah, well, first day of rounds,

05:27.098 --> 05:28.465
he's trash-talking G.P.s,

05:28.532 --> 05:31.000
saying that a real doctor uses a scalpel...

05:31.068 --> 05:32.569
- Yeah.
- Not a rectal thermometer.

05:32.636 --> 05:33.770
Ah.

05:33.838 --> 05:35.605
I'm kind of scrappy, so I say,

05:35.673 --> 05:37.704
"hey, I'd be proud to be a G.P."

05:37.855 --> 05:39.775
Next thing I know, he hauls me into the O.R.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.279
and has me cut into a kid
and retrieve a bullet.

05:43.347 --> 05:44.010
First day?

05:44.096 --> 05:46.200
- Mm. First day.
- Wow.

05:46.339 --> 05:48.817
Yeah, love it. Love it.

05:48.886 --> 05:50.219
Okay.

05:54.691 --> 05:57.593
My god.

05:57.660 --> 05:59.595
Why is he bleeding?

05:59.662 --> 06:01.330
It's not his blood.

06:05.334 --> 06:07.335
You cut me.

06:15.595 --> 06:17.494
I'm really sorry.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.646
It's just that your...
your hand moved and...

06:19.714 --> 06:21.963
Geez. Whoa. My hand moved?

06:22.013 --> 06:23.113
You're not laying this on me.

06:23.163 --> 06:24.016
Listen, I know it's my fault.

06:24.066 --> 06:25.752
You're damn right it's your fault!

06:25.820 --> 06:27.888
But please-please don't report this.

06:29.190 --> 06:31.383
Rian, that needle went through him,
and it punctured me.

06:31.945 --> 06:33.328
- We both got to get tested.
- I understand that.

06:33.378 --> 06:34.518
What I'm saying... it's one mistake.

06:34.572 --> 06:37.374
Well, it has consequences, doctor.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.208
I need you to understand this is
a new and unproven therapy.

06:49.275 --> 06:51.143
There's not even a protocol for it.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.411
I-I get it.

06:52.479 --> 06:53.945
You're the Stockhausen of brain surgery.

06:54.013 --> 06:54.879
Maria, it's hot.

06:56.549 --> 06:59.084
A fearless renegade, ahead of his time.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.086
Although I-I prefer Mozart.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.354
Not that I'm comparing myself
to either genius.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.256
Yeah, well, we're-we're desperate.

07:05.324 --> 07:07.291
Anything's better than living like this.

07:07.359 --> 07:10.294
We... we should be traveling the world.

07:10.362 --> 07:11.262
Bali?

07:11.330 --> 07:12.797
Did we go to Bali?

07:12.865 --> 07:14.599
Five years ago, Kuta Beach.

07:14.667 --> 07:17.836
And now we're looking for
apartments in assisted living.

07:17.903 --> 07:19.070
Kuta Beach?

07:19.138 --> 07:20.138
Mm-hmm.

07:20.205 --> 07:23.040
She turns 42 next week.

07:23.108 --> 07:26.511
♪ But my brain and bum are 100 ♪

07:31.250 --> 07:34.008
She's still the only one
that can make me laugh.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.486
I'm sorry.

07:36.554 --> 07:40.624
I'm sorry.

07:40.692 --> 07:43.193
Well, as we've discussed,

07:43.261 --> 07:46.130
omentum transplantation
is a radical development.

07:46.197 --> 07:48.198
So was the early-onset Alzheimer's.

07:48.266 --> 07:49.733
I've seen it as young as 28.

07:51.036 --> 07:53.836
Not that that's any comfort.

07:53.904 --> 07:58.908
But if the surgery is a success,
you'll see improvement.

07:58.976 --> 08:01.978
I can't even let myself go there.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.714
I understand.

08:04.782 --> 08:07.517
I used to know the names of all the flowers.

08:07.585 --> 08:10.053
Ah. That's a... that's a Lily.

08:12.690 --> 08:15.391
It's like the word is hiding

08:15.458 --> 08:19.328
behind a locked door.

08:19.396 --> 08:22.932
I know he's my husband,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.767
but I don't even know his name.

08:25.835 --> 08:28.470
It's... it's Malcolm. Maria.

08:30.373 --> 08:32.207
Malcolm.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.448
Is it possible that, under this smiley face,

08:40.517 --> 08:42.984
- I'm actually a bad person?
- You're back.

08:43.052 --> 08:44.519
Again.

08:44.587 --> 08:47.022
Nobody sutures better than Alex,

08:47.090 --> 08:49.524
but today she got passed over
for this big surgery,

08:49.592 --> 08:54.696
and maybe I felt just a little tiny bit...

08:54.764 --> 08:56.732
happy about it.

08:56.799 --> 08:58.766
I'm a horrible friend, aren't I?

08:58.834 --> 09:00.935
- Maggie...
- This is doctor/patient privilege, right?

09:01.002 --> 09:02.214
No, because you're not my patient.

09:02.264 --> 09:03.719
I know, but Gavin used
to let me come in here...

09:03.812 --> 09:05.829
- and I'm not your boyfriend.
- Duh.

09:05.915 --> 09:09.510
And just so you know, I'm celibate.

09:14.170 --> 09:17.259
- Alex, you're up.
- What's going on?

09:17.345 --> 09:18.986
Larouche nicked Reycraft during surgery.

09:19.613 --> 09:20.606
I hope he's all right.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.640
I need you to assist
on my omentum transplant.

09:22.690 --> 09:23.587
Has Dawn signed off on me?

09:23.637 --> 09:24.608
It's been months in the planning.

09:24.669 --> 09:26.303
It was either you or cancel it.

09:26.494 --> 09:28.295
Oh. Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

09:28.363 --> 09:29.864
I need you to walk Malcolm...

09:29.931 --> 09:31.176
my patient's husband...

09:31.280 --> 09:33.233
through your end of the procedure.

09:33.301 --> 09:33.900
What, now?

09:33.968 --> 09:35.702
Yes. Now.

09:37.421 --> 09:38.267
Okay.

09:38.550 --> 09:39.939
Okay.

09:41.909 --> 09:44.210
There's a selection
of visual aids, if required.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.579
Mm-hmm.

09:45.647 --> 09:47.581
You have 15 minutes.

09:47.649 --> 09:49.869
Oh, that should be...

09:51.218 --> 09:53.153
It should be enough time.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.090
Once you produce a sample,

09:54.147 --> 09:56.923
we'll do a semen analysis
and assess your motility.

09:56.991 --> 09:57.957
Good luck.

09:58.025 --> 10:00.260
Thank you.

10:00.327 --> 10:01.740
Dr. Harris,

10:01.829 --> 10:04.930
I didn't realize you
and Dr. Bell were a couple.

10:04.998 --> 10:06.632
We're...

10:06.700 --> 10:08.233
Thank you.

10:16.543 --> 10:19.211
Mm.

10:27.921 --> 10:30.789
Hey. Okay.

10:30.857 --> 10:32.590
Am I in hell?

10:32.658 --> 10:34.126
Jury's still out.

10:34.194 --> 10:36.795
Um, you're, uh...

10:36.863 --> 10:37.796
Dead?

10:37.863 --> 10:39.130
Yeah.

10:39.198 --> 10:41.966
You lost a leg and bled out on the table.
We, um,

10:42.034 --> 10:43.225
couldn't save you.

10:43.304 --> 10:44.150
Yeah, well, I guess

10:44.200 --> 10:46.170
walking in front of a streetcar didn't help.

10:46.238 --> 10:47.407
No.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.008
I-is this a-a relaxation thing?

10:51.076 --> 10:52.333
Uh, no.

10:52.394 --> 10:55.311
No, just, uh, trying to help
a friend out, I guess.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.248
Helping hand.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.616
Yeah.

10:59.684 --> 11:01.893
Well, I-I-I guess I'll leave you to it.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.654
Yeah, probably isn't a...

11:03.722 --> 11:06.290
Actually, could you do me a...?

11:06.358 --> 11:08.759
I-I-I just need one thing.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.399
No, honey, I'm fine.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.231
There's no need to come up.

11:14.298 --> 11:15.699
Look, I got to go.

11:15.767 --> 11:18.201
Love you, too.

11:18.269 --> 11:21.538
Whoever said "third time lucky"
never got to three.

11:23.608 --> 11:25.599
Boy, you two look glum.

11:25.649 --> 11:27.177
Have I got cancer or something?

11:27.245 --> 11:29.045
No, no. Everything went well.

11:29.113 --> 11:30.213
Good.

11:30.281 --> 11:32.715
Yeah. There was, uh...

11:33.170 --> 11:34.985
there was one small hiccup.

11:35.531 --> 11:36.586
Yeah?

11:38.889 --> 11:41.057
In the course of closing,
I nicked Dr. Reycraft, sir.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.959
Don't tell me.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.428
Retention needle.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.385
How'd you know?

11:46.463 --> 11:48.527
I got them banned from my hospital.

11:48.581 --> 11:51.397
The blunt ones are just as good
with none of the risks.

11:51.498 --> 11:54.036
Well, Sam, uh-uh, listen.

11:54.104 --> 11:55.271
Uh, some of my blood...

11:55.439 --> 11:56.596
It happens.

11:56.747 --> 11:58.743
Okay, but I just... I was tested
six weeks ago...

11:58.832 --> 12:00.670
I know you. I'm not worried.

12:00.944 --> 12:02.644
Ah, well.

12:02.712 --> 12:04.938
And, um, I mean, you don't...?

12:05.002 --> 12:07.070
Have any blood-borne diseases? No.

12:07.192 --> 12:09.256
Okay, I'm I hate to ask.

12:09.306 --> 12:11.416
I wouldn't have trained you
very well if you didn't.

12:11.502 --> 12:13.132
It was completely my fault, sir.

12:13.208 --> 12:14.756
30 years in the O.R.,

12:14.824 --> 12:16.691
I've been nicked more than a few times.

12:18.572 --> 12:21.029
All right, old guy. Get some rest, huh?

12:21.096 --> 12:23.164
Sure. Yeah.

12:26.736 --> 12:27.969
They're my things.

12:28.037 --> 12:30.071
Well, you're dead. There's a protocol.

12:30.139 --> 12:32.006
Zach.

12:32.074 --> 12:33.341
Hey.

12:33.409 --> 12:34.506
What do you need?

12:34.574 --> 12:36.433
- Oliver Flemmer.
- I'm doing his paperwork.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.358
Yeah. I need to go through
his personal effects.

12:39.393 --> 12:40.826
Show me your underwear.

12:40.876 --> 12:41.882
Say what?

12:41.951 --> 12:43.256
Well, you're so quick to violate
his privacy.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.286
- How about I violate yours?
- Well...

12:45.354 --> 12:46.477
There's just something
I need to check.

12:46.527 --> 12:48.028
All personal possessions accompany the body

12:48.107 --> 12:49.437
to the funeral home
unless taken by the family.

12:49.515 --> 12:51.368
- You know that.
- They're right there.

12:51.432 --> 12:53.060
Look, stop being opaque, Charlie.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.895
Now, what's this vague something
you speak of?

12:54.963 --> 12:56.964
Tell him I told you something
before I passed.

12:57.031 --> 12:58.330
It's just something he told me before he...

12:58.380 --> 12:59.982
What, he came to again?

13:00.201 --> 13:01.535
Yes. You were, um...

13:01.603 --> 13:04.338
you were busy doing some... something else.

13:04.405 --> 13:05.862
Say it's highly embarrassing.

13:05.937 --> 13:07.291
It's just a little bit embarrassing,

13:07.341 --> 13:08.942
and if his kids find out,
they're gonna be...

13:09.010 --> 13:09.706
No.

13:11.179 --> 13:14.281
Not unless you trade me Dustin "Pedrilla."

13:14.349 --> 13:18.026
It's Dustin Pedroia, and no.

13:18.094 --> 13:19.932
You know what it took
for me to get that
gutsy little all-star?

13:19.982 --> 13:21.201
- Forget about it.
- Look, I don't care.

13:21.276 --> 13:22.365
He's just a bunch of stats to me.

13:22.444 --> 13:23.250
But that's the deal...

13:23.336 --> 13:25.246
Dustin Pedroia

13:25.784 --> 13:27.393
for the bag.

13:29.029 --> 13:30.763
Mother...

13:35.002 --> 13:36.936
So, I will be harvesting
your wife's omentum.

13:37.004 --> 13:38.237
Harvesting?

13:38.305 --> 13:40.072
The omentum is a sheet of fatty tissue

13:40.140 --> 13:42.141
that covers your abdomen and your organs.

13:42.209 --> 13:44.176
It's rich with neurotransmitters, so...

13:44.244 --> 13:47.779
Dr. Reid is going to stretch it
and plant it on your brain.

13:47.847 --> 13:49.511
What on earth for?

13:49.583 --> 13:51.917
Well, with any luck,
it will grow new blood vessels

13:51.985 --> 13:53.152
and help oxygenate your brain.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.853
What's left of it.

13:55.226 --> 13:57.789
The omentum could actually help regrow it,

13:57.857 --> 13:59.257
improve your memory.

13:59.325 --> 14:01.059
Sounds crazy.

14:01.127 --> 14:02.427
Dr. Hamza is an incredible s...

14:02.495 --> 14:03.550
You don't have to tell me.

14:03.621 --> 14:05.065
We hit the jackpot with that guy.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.491
And he has a crush on you.

14:07.577 --> 14:11.069
No, he doesn't.

14:12.471 --> 14:14.464
So, Malcolm, do you understand

14:14.514 --> 14:16.908
the procedure you're consenting
to on your wife's behalf?

14:16.975 --> 14:18.143
Mm-hmm.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.165
Right.

14:21.988 --> 14:22.970
Sorry.

14:23.078 --> 14:24.672
It's nothing, just a bit of carpal tunnel.

14:24.758 --> 14:26.617
I've seen my share of hand cramping.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.920
That looks more like focal dystonia.

14:28.987 --> 14:31.722
- Are you a doctor?
- A violinist.

14:31.790 --> 14:33.057
Musicians get it a lot.

14:33.124 --> 14:35.242
A buddy of mine had to quit
the London Symphony

14:35.317 --> 14:37.695
because his hand just stopped working.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.718
Well, I don't have focal dystonia.

14:40.065 --> 14:40.921
Good.

14:42.287 --> 14:44.562
- Because if you did...
- But I don't.

14:45.803 --> 14:46.870
We are done here.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.638
You've left motherhood late.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.874
I've been busy...

14:53.971 --> 14:55.931
the whole chief-of-surgery thing.

14:56.042 --> 14:57.644
Well, let's hope it's not too late.

14:57.726 --> 14:58.657
I'm not worried.

14:58.724 --> 15:00.258
I've always been the exception to the rule.

15:00.326 --> 15:01.559
It's biology.

15:01.627 --> 15:03.494
There are no exceptions to this rule.

15:03.561 --> 15:05.529
I ovulate like this.

15:05.597 --> 15:07.231
I could drop an egg for fun, if you'd like,

15:07.299 --> 15:08.966
right here, right now.

15:09.034 --> 15:11.169
No. That's fine. Thank you.

15:11.236 --> 15:14.238
So, the lower the FSH reading,
the better, obviously.

15:14.306 --> 15:16.274
Like golf.

15:16.341 --> 15:17.675
Okay, we done?

15:17.742 --> 15:18.809
We're done.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.010
Okay. Put a rush on it, will you?

15:24.148 --> 15:25.182
Do you mind?

15:25.249 --> 15:26.950
Oh, it's just a medical chart.

15:27.018 --> 15:29.219
Thought it was your fantasy baseball team.

15:29.287 --> 15:32.255
Nope. Just closing out
my appendicitis in 404.

15:32.324 --> 15:33.490
That's your mentor?

15:33.558 --> 15:35.225
Yeah.

15:35.293 --> 15:39.985
You know, the difference between
a surgeon and an E.R. doctor

15:40.118 --> 15:41.824
is that you cut things out of people

15:41.906 --> 15:43.859
and I read their stats. This...

15:44.149 --> 15:45.202
that's a bad number.

15:45.269 --> 15:47.570
Yeah, well, not if you consider
he's on mega-statins

15:47.638 --> 15:49.039
for high cholesterol.

15:49.106 --> 15:52.007
Well, this looks like
a preexisting condition.

15:52.075 --> 15:53.209
Seriously?

15:53.276 --> 15:55.678
I'd run a full panel.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.248
He's... he's like a father to me.

15:59.316 --> 16:02.852
Well, my bet... daddy's got hep "C."

16:09.092 --> 16:12.694
Do you ever think about after it's over?

16:12.762 --> 16:14.330
Death?

16:14.397 --> 16:15.530
Retirement.

16:15.598 --> 16:17.399
Ugh. That's what accountants are for.

16:17.467 --> 16:19.835
I mean, if you have to.

16:19.903 --> 16:22.338
Well, sure, I've thought about it.

16:22.405 --> 16:24.240
I had cancer.

16:24.307 --> 16:27.909
So, you could just walk away?

16:28.637 --> 16:30.031
Well, you know what they say...

16:30.081 --> 16:33.181
no one ever dies wishing they'd
spent more time at the office.

16:33.249 --> 16:34.583
I might be the first.

16:36.486 --> 16:37.819
What's up?

16:37.887 --> 16:40.054
What? Oh, nothing. I'm-I'm fine.

16:40.454 --> 16:41.990
Really? Haven't even written your boards,

16:42.057 --> 16:44.225
you're already worried
about early retirement. Okay.

16:44.847 --> 16:46.394
Okay, here's the thing.

16:46.461 --> 16:50.899
Um... I've been having
some weirdness with my hand.

16:51.354 --> 16:52.887
I'm sure it's nothing.

16:53.070 --> 16:56.840
Weirdness with your hand. Hmm. Can I see?

17:01.132 --> 17:02.225
Any pain?

17:02.444 --> 17:03.092
Not really.

17:03.142 --> 17:05.546
It's more like a-a random cramping.

17:05.614 --> 17:06.518
It's hard to describe,

17:06.589 --> 17:11.285
but whenever I search symptoms,
it suggests focal dystonia.

17:13.193 --> 17:14.501
You feel that?

17:14.686 --> 17:15.321
Yeah.

17:15.390 --> 17:17.424
It mainly just spasms while I'm suturing.

17:18.964 --> 17:20.710
Okay, here. This is your needle.

17:20.760 --> 17:21.929
Show me.

17:25.694 --> 17:26.952
- Uh...
- Oh.

17:27.002 --> 17:27.633
Like that.

17:27.683 --> 17:29.236
Yep. That's the diagnosis...

17:29.304 --> 17:31.603
involuntary cramping
due to specific movement.

17:31.653 --> 17:33.040
But how have you been treating it?

17:33.090 --> 17:35.630
Because most idiots, you know,
start to overcompensate.

17:35.731 --> 17:39.479
Like, musicians tend to practice for hours.

17:39.547 --> 17:42.816
Then that's what you've been
doing, isn't it?

17:42.883 --> 17:44.893
You've been practicing your suturing.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.619
- Yes.
- That's the worst thing you can do.

17:46.687 --> 17:47.853
Well, I have to do something.

17:47.921 --> 17:49.956
Long-term physio is quite effective.

17:50.023 --> 17:51.357
I need short-term.

17:52.231 --> 17:53.359
How about botox?

17:53.427 --> 17:56.895
Quick shot to the first dorsal,
calm things down for a while.

17:56.964 --> 17:58.264
Side effects?

17:58.332 --> 18:00.499
Oh, well, there's always
side effects, right?

18:00.567 --> 18:03.336
But... think about it.

18:08.792 --> 18:09.967
Hey.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.615
Still playing the ponies?

18:12.665 --> 18:14.780
At least horses don't disappoint
like humans,

18:14.848 --> 18:16.114
and when they do, you can shoot them.

18:18.117 --> 18:19.952
Right. You're right.

18:20.019 --> 18:22.753
So, I, um... I ran a full blood panel.

18:22.821 --> 18:24.189
Yeah?

18:25.070 --> 18:28.093
And, uh, Sam, you're...

18:28.160 --> 18:29.927
you're hep "C"-positive.

18:29.996 --> 18:34.032
What? You... you got to be kidding me.

18:34.100 --> 18:37.502
I mean, it... it's bad news,
yes, but it's manageable.

18:37.569 --> 18:40.738
Well, sure. And... and you?

18:40.806 --> 18:43.674
I'll-I'll go on interferon.

18:43.742 --> 18:45.409
Oh, my god.

18:45.477 --> 18:47.311
It's just in case.

18:47.379 --> 18:50.615
Well, who's gonna let me operate now?

18:50.682 --> 18:54.751
Nobody's gonna refer patients
to a hep "C"-positive surgeon.

18:56.954 --> 18:58.455
What if you didn't report it?

18:58.523 --> 19:01.392
You got to get treated.

19:01.459 --> 19:02.692
I got to get tested.

19:02.760 --> 19:03.894
No, of course.

19:03.961 --> 19:06.330
All I'm saying is, to my insurer.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.299
We can't bury this.

19:10.367 --> 19:13.336
No. Of course.

19:13.404 --> 19:14.771
I'm sorry.

19:14.839 --> 19:16.339
I-I-I don't know what's wrong with me.

19:16.407 --> 19:17.407
No, no, it's-it's fine.

19:17.474 --> 19:18.808
It's... I mean, you're in shock.

19:18.876 --> 19:20.410
It's... it's totally understandable.

19:20.477 --> 19:23.747
Yeah.

19:23.814 --> 19:27.083
This is a career-ender, Tom.

19:27.151 --> 19:28.851
No, not necessarily.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.719
No. It is.

19:30.787 --> 19:32.955
And you know it.

19:36.593 --> 19:38.094
So, what is it I'm looking for?

19:38.162 --> 19:39.862
What's, uh... what's so embarrassing?

19:39.930 --> 19:41.764
A key, a small key.

19:41.831 --> 19:45.000
This it?

19:45.068 --> 19:46.635
Yeah.

19:46.703 --> 19:47.937
Now, all you got to do

19:48.004 --> 19:49.538
is retrieve the lockbox that it opens.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.373
No. You said one thing.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.141
This is my one thing.

19:53.209 --> 19:55.444
Well, it's a two-part one thing.

19:55.511 --> 19:58.781
What's in the box, Oliver?

19:58.848 --> 20:00.482
Some cash.

20:00.550 --> 20:01.583
How much?

20:01.650 --> 20:03.085
$20,000.

20:03.152 --> 20:04.419
Not what you think.

20:04.487 --> 20:05.620
I went bankrupt, okay?

20:05.688 --> 20:06.921
I got to keep income off the books.

20:06.989 --> 20:08.623
So you keep your money in a lockbox?

20:08.691 --> 20:10.492
I'm a liquidator. It's a cash business.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.860
When I died, I was on my way to buy 20 skids

20:12.928 --> 20:15.297
at 200 boxes a skid
of bohemian lead crystal.

20:15.364 --> 20:17.264
Well, I'd say that ship has sailed.

20:17.332 --> 20:19.133
Oh, no, no. The deal's still good.

20:19.201 --> 20:22.103
All you got to do is pay the guy
that I'm buying it off of.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.005
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

20:24.073 --> 20:26.641
Look, for starters, it sounds illegal.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.076
No, this stuff was seized by customs

20:28.143 --> 20:29.811
'cause they didn't pay the duty. It's legit.

20:29.878 --> 20:33.013
No. Just, um... no.

20:33.081 --> 20:34.748
Charlie.

20:34.816 --> 20:39.186
No! I'm not buying your crystal
for you, Oliver.

20:42.357 --> 20:44.024
Malcolm mentioned an issue with your hand.

20:44.557 --> 20:45.271
It's fine.

20:45.337 --> 20:46.777
Alex, everything hangs on your ability

20:46.851 --> 20:49.462
to stretch his wife's omentum
from her stomach to her brain.

20:49.530 --> 20:50.410
Not to worry.

20:50.512 --> 20:51.912
It's very malleable, stretches like dough.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.275
Yep, just like making a pizza,

20:53.361 --> 20:55.969
which I happen to be
very good at, by the way.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.838
You've never made a pizza, clearly.

20:57.905 --> 20:59.572
Alex, if you truly have a problem,

20:59.641 --> 21:00.941
I have to cancel the surgery.

21:01.009 --> 21:04.011
Shahir, I'm fine, okay?

21:04.078 --> 21:05.578
Okay, I'll see you in there.

21:05.646 --> 21:07.813
And, Dr. Lin, if you want,
you can join, too.

21:07.881 --> 21:10.450
Oh, this is gonna be super fun.

21:10.518 --> 21:12.385
Okay.

21:12.453 --> 21:14.487
Hey.

21:19.017 --> 21:20.567
If you botox my hand now,

21:20.617 --> 21:22.094
will I be able to operate this afternoon?

21:22.162 --> 21:23.228
Sure.

21:23.296 --> 21:24.563
Okay. I want it.

21:24.631 --> 21:27.199
Shahir needs me. I can't let him down.

21:48.087 --> 21:50.656
That's all there is to it. Flex.

21:51.857 --> 21:52.824
Good.

21:52.892 --> 21:54.426
Thank you.

21:54.494 --> 21:56.027
Of course.

21:56.095 --> 21:59.197
What more can I say except
to say that I apologize?

22:00.584 --> 22:02.967
No, you-you know what?

22:03.035 --> 22:05.103
You can go down to the lab and tell them

22:05.171 --> 22:07.405
that you mislabeled
Dr. Campbell's blood work.

22:07.472 --> 22:09.908
Just give them these.

22:09.975 --> 22:12.443
Get them to re-label.

22:17.616 --> 22:18.982
This says John Smith.

22:19.050 --> 22:20.451
Mm-hmm. That's right.

22:22.987 --> 22:24.822
Do you... do you want me to...

22:24.889 --> 22:26.857
Lie? Yes.

22:29.327 --> 22:30.961
What if they don't believe me?

22:32.864 --> 22:34.331
Play to your strength.

22:34.398 --> 22:36.066
I'm sorry. Now, what is my strength?

22:36.134 --> 22:39.103
You're an idiot. Plead rookie mistake.

22:39.170 --> 22:41.304
They'll cut you some slack.

22:42.941 --> 22:44.608
Okay.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.482
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:03.084 --> 23:04.584
Is that my pen?

23:04.652 --> 23:06.853
Yeah.

23:06.921 --> 23:09.022
It's old, but still producing ink.

23:09.090 --> 23:10.090
Ho, ho!

23:11.892 --> 23:13.526
How is Dr. Katz?

23:13.594 --> 23:16.330
Uh, good.

23:16.397 --> 23:17.364
So?

23:19.876 --> 23:22.234
We kind of got waylaid.

23:22.823 --> 23:24.639
Look, Charlie, if you're not into this, I...

23:24.745 --> 23:27.806
No, Dawn, I'm...
I'm feeling good about this.

23:28.175 --> 23:29.609
It's, uh...

23:29.677 --> 23:33.480
It's nice to think about
the future and not the past.

23:41.121 --> 23:43.189
- Bye.
- Bye.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.868
Come on!

23:57.103 --> 23:58.837
Got to stop interrupting me.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.606
No, not until you say yes.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.307
Can't you get one of your kids to do it?

24:02.375 --> 24:04.075
I told them I'd stop
with my business ventures.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.677
I wouldn't want them to be disappointed.

24:05.745 --> 24:06.442
You died.

24:06.532 --> 24:08.747
I'm pretty sure they're more
concerned about that right now.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.074
Well, you don't know what it's like.

24:10.148 --> 24:11.316
You're not a failure.

24:11.384 --> 24:13.084
You're not a failure, Oliver.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.886
Oh, yes, I am.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.287
I'm a classic failure.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.822
I collected Tiffany lamps,

24:17.890 --> 24:19.466
figured they'd always go up in value.

24:19.568 --> 24:20.356
And then when I went bankrupt,

24:20.437 --> 24:23.228
I tried to sell them...
all fakes, every one.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.431
Now I'm finally onto something good.

24:26.499 --> 24:27.665
Let it lie.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.166
No.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.036
And I'm gonna haunt you
until you do my deal for me.

24:32.103 --> 24:34.505
Okay, first it was one thing.
Then it was two.

24:34.573 --> 24:35.817
Now it... now-now it's "deal"?

24:35.898 --> 24:36.964
It's for my kids.

24:37.070 --> 24:38.045
You know, as far as they're concerned,

24:38.119 --> 24:39.547
I'm leaving them nothing but debts.

24:39.621 --> 24:41.249
But if I can turn this 20 grand into 60...

24:41.299 --> 24:43.680
Oh, come on, Charlie, please.

24:44.959 --> 24:46.383
I'll call your kids.

24:46.451 --> 24:48.352
I'll let them decide.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.853
Best I can do.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.656
Okay, there's...
there's just one other thing.

24:56.561 --> 24:57.727
Played to my strength.

24:57.795 --> 25:01.431
Whoa, whoa, wait. So, y-you got it sorted?

25:01.498 --> 25:03.700
I said I made a mistake,
got the patients confused,

25:03.768 --> 25:05.602
it won't happen again. So, we're even?

25:05.670 --> 25:06.870
- Yep.
- Let me tell you something, okay?

25:06.938 --> 25:08.271
If anyone finds out about this,

25:08.338 --> 25:10.040
it's not just Dr. Campbell's
career on the line.

25:10.107 --> 25:11.007
Do you understand that?

25:11.075 --> 25:12.976
So don't tell anyone.

25:19.383 --> 25:20.583
This is the main blood supply.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.085
You want to tie that one off, Maggie?

25:22.152 --> 25:24.087
Okay.

25:25.301 --> 25:26.811
Scissors.

25:28.625 --> 25:31.994
So, Maria's husband seems like
an interesting guy.

25:32.062 --> 25:33.729
He is.

25:33.797 --> 25:35.660
He's a musician.

25:35.754 --> 25:37.350
Oh. Who is he? Do I know him?

25:37.444 --> 25:39.534
He plays first chair
in a chamber music group.

25:39.603 --> 25:40.869
Hot.

25:40.937 --> 25:43.138
Musicians' hands are the sexiest.

25:43.206 --> 25:45.235
He'd be a totally inappropriate
boyfriend for you.

25:45.309 --> 25:46.750
Don't encourage her.

25:47.007 --> 25:50.112
Besides, he's a...

25:50.427 --> 25:52.614
he's-he's happily married, so...

25:52.681 --> 25:54.082
Are you okay?

25:54.150 --> 25:56.151
I'm fine.

25:56.219 --> 25:58.253
Hand me the shunt passer.

26:11.800 --> 26:14.002
Okay, okay. Watch the lung.

26:15.437 --> 26:16.871
Shahir, you look clammy.

26:16.939 --> 26:20.008
I'm fine.

26:21.476 --> 26:23.781
May I have some water, please?

26:23.855 --> 26:25.916
- Put a stitch in it, Maggie.
- Mm-hmm.

26:29.851 --> 26:31.318
Okay.

26:33.522 --> 26:34.921
Okay.

26:34.989 --> 26:37.958
Okay. Here we go.

26:47.835 --> 26:49.870
Good. She's all yours.

26:49.937 --> 26:51.004
Okay.

26:51.072 --> 26:52.973
Shahir, you're drenched in sweat.

26:53.041 --> 26:54.841
I just need to lay the omentum
over the brain.

26:54.909 --> 26:56.309
Uh, no, no. She's... she's right.

26:56.377 --> 26:57.977
You look like you're about to pass out.

26:58.045 --> 26:58.711
What's going on?

26:58.779 --> 27:00.946
Side cutter.

27:18.165 --> 27:19.331
Alex?

27:19.399 --> 27:22.401
- Yeah.
- Can you take my pulse?

27:22.468 --> 27:24.804
It's possible I might be having
a heart attack.

27:24.871 --> 27:26.172
What?

27:31.958 --> 27:33.858
Maggie, page Dawn.

27:33.926 --> 27:35.226
Shahir, you've got to stop.

27:35.294 --> 27:37.895
I can't now, not when the dura's exposed.

27:37.964 --> 27:40.098
- You're in A-fib.
- I have no choice.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.600
If I don't finish,
the omentum will be useless.

27:42.668 --> 27:45.336
There will be no second chance
for Malcolm... I mean her.

27:45.403 --> 27:46.971
Bone flap! Bone flap!

27:49.074 --> 27:51.709
Dr. Sharpe, do you have
any sublingual nitro?

27:51.777 --> 27:53.149
- Nitro galore.
- Give it to him.

27:53.234 --> 27:55.112
Page neuro. See who's on call.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.381
Nasal prongs, and set oxygen
at five liters a minute.

27:57.449 --> 27:58.924
And let's get an EKG on him.

27:59.105 --> 28:01.218
Okay, Shahir, we're gonna pull
your pants down.

28:01.286 --> 28:03.753
I'm gonna wire you up with some EKG leads.

28:07.525 --> 28:09.626
Just take a nice, deep breath.

28:09.694 --> 28:11.962
Okay.

28:12.030 --> 28:13.763
Dawn's not answering. I'm gonna go.

28:13.831 --> 28:15.332
Go find her.

28:17.868 --> 28:19.870
Okay, nice, deep breath.

28:23.142 --> 28:25.141
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:25.209 --> 28:27.577
I just... I just need to finish
reattaching the skull.

28:27.645 --> 28:32.015
I know. Slow your breathing.

28:39.156 --> 28:40.423
You're gonna be okay.

28:40.491 --> 28:42.291
Okay. Okay.

28:44.428 --> 28:47.897
I-I can't tell you how sick
I feel about this.

28:47.964 --> 28:49.332
Mm.

28:52.268 --> 28:53.736
Um...

28:53.803 --> 28:56.939
so, listen, your blood work is in the system...

28:59.009 --> 29:01.309
under the name John Smith.

29:02.473 --> 29:04.446
Excuse me?

29:04.957 --> 29:07.349
I know you'll take precautions.

29:07.417 --> 29:09.565
Of course, but...

29:09.892 --> 29:11.488
you're saying

29:11.554 --> 29:14.356
my insurance company
won't find out I have hep "C"?

29:14.746 --> 29:17.992
You don't. John Smith does.

29:22.131 --> 29:24.799
You did this for me?

29:26.330 --> 29:28.520
I'm gonna go get tested now. Wish me luck.

29:28.605 --> 29:30.471
Hey. Good luck.

29:30.539 --> 29:34.341
Whichever way this goes, I've got your back.

29:37.813 --> 29:40.132
I've been doing this dance
nearly five years.

29:40.223 --> 29:42.450
I'm getting pretty good at it.

29:43.785 --> 29:45.018
What?

29:47.189 --> 29:50.191
I'm just saying, uh, whatever happens...

29:50.258 --> 29:51.425
You knew about this?

29:51.493 --> 29:53.594
Th-th-that we'll deal with this.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.662
Wait. You knew about this the whole time?

29:55.730 --> 29:57.998
What's it matter now?

29:58.066 --> 30:01.501
I did what I had to do. So will you.

30:01.569 --> 30:03.804
Right.

30:13.647 --> 30:15.582
I got your blood test back.

30:15.649 --> 30:18.351
So, what's my FSH? I'm guessing 6, 7?

30:18.419 --> 30:19.919
22.

30:22.923 --> 30:24.757
22?

30:24.825 --> 30:26.459
Your eggs are...

30:26.527 --> 30:29.194
Paleolithic. Yeah, I get it.

30:29.262 --> 30:30.663
Dawn, with these levels,

30:30.731 --> 30:32.698
I think we should be
considering egg donation.

30:32.766 --> 30:37.069
We? You're saying that I ca...

30:38.471 --> 30:40.472
Me?

30:40.540 --> 30:43.542
You're saying I can't have a child?

30:43.610 --> 30:47.246
Given your age and these numbers,

30:47.313 --> 30:49.148
probably not.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.089
I'm sorry. Dr. Bell, Dr. Hamza
is having a heart attack.

30:58.158 --> 30:59.625
We need you.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.268
Shahir, I am ordering you to stop.

31:10.335 --> 31:13.705
You have elevations in V4 through V6.

31:13.773 --> 31:14.853
Stop working, or you will die.

31:14.957 --> 31:17.608
Alex, are you sure you can close?

31:17.677 --> 31:18.942
Yes.

31:19.010 --> 31:19.943
Go.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.045
Okay. Okay.

31:21.112 --> 31:22.413
Get me to an angioplasty suite.

31:24.550 --> 31:26.184
And stent me.

31:26.251 --> 31:27.017
Okay.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.425
He died as he lived.

31:35.493 --> 31:38.595
I mean, what kind of grown man
walks in front of a streetcar?

31:38.663 --> 31:41.765
The... the same kind who leaves
his kids a treasure map.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.167
That's not his writing.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.835
Uh, no, that's-that's mine.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.637
I kind of drew this out for him.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.140
Is that, um, grenadier pond?

31:50.208 --> 31:51.541
Yeah.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.276
Let's go, Danny.

31:53.344 --> 31:54.477
Charlie, you can't let her leave.

31:54.545 --> 31:56.346
Pauline! Uh, don't you want to...

31:56.414 --> 31:58.448
at least want to see where
the treasure is buried?

31:58.516 --> 31:59.816
There is no treasure.

31:59.883 --> 32:01.150
We don't know that!

32:01.219 --> 32:03.786
It's the easter-egg hunt all over again.

32:03.854 --> 32:05.154
Ugh. She always brings that up.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.624
Every year, we'd have an easter-egg hunt,

32:07.692 --> 32:09.425
and we'd never find any eggs.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.828
You know why? Because he never hid any.

32:11.895 --> 32:14.396
But we had fun.

32:14.464 --> 32:17.166
Um, guys, this is kind of like
a deathbed confession.

32:17.234 --> 32:19.301
I can't see your father lying about this.

32:19.369 --> 32:21.003
It's never lying to him.

32:21.071 --> 32:23.606
He thinks if you dream hard enough,

32:23.673 --> 32:24.873
dreams come true.

32:24.941 --> 32:26.575
They did that one time.

32:26.643 --> 32:28.744
But they were somebody else's eggs.

32:30.413 --> 32:31.980
I-is that the creek up below bloor?

32:32.048 --> 32:34.450
Yeah, yeah, and this is a large berm

32:34.517 --> 32:36.585
with, uh, an oak tree on top.

32:36.653 --> 32:38.954
That's an evergreen.

32:39.021 --> 32:41.923
It's... a tree.

32:41.991 --> 32:46.228
Um, and this is the culvert
where the treasure is buried.

32:46.295 --> 32:47.695
Excuse me.

32:49.799 --> 32:52.400
Sorry, guys. I have to... I have to go.

32:52.468 --> 32:53.902
You'll have to excuse me.

32:56.939 --> 32:58.473
This doesn't just happen.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.775
There had to be some warning signs,

33:00.842 --> 33:02.810
some symptoms that you missed.

33:02.878 --> 33:05.079
I didn't notice anything unusual.

33:05.147 --> 33:08.516
Maybe it's the 20-hour days
you've been pulling.

33:08.584 --> 33:12.420
Could be, but that's not about to change.

33:12.488 --> 33:15.823
Shahir, I heard you had a heart attack.

33:15.891 --> 33:18.993
Minor infarct, but I finished
my omentum surgery.

33:19.060 --> 33:20.527
I don't know what was worse...

33:20.595 --> 33:22.997
him having a heart attack
or operating without pants.

33:24.465 --> 33:26.633
Shahir did a pretty amazing thing in there.

33:26.701 --> 33:28.735
I did.

33:30.205 --> 33:32.339
Your lady wasn't so bad herself.

33:40.009 --> 33:42.579
Your map was really accurate.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.943
- It was weird.
- Yeah.

33:45.043 --> 33:46.335
Sorry for making you come back.

33:46.387 --> 33:48.130
I meant to give you the key earlier.

33:48.225 --> 33:50.719
- I just...
- It's, uh... it's no problem.

33:53.656 --> 33:55.624
I can't open it.

33:57.727 --> 33:59.061
So don't.

33:59.129 --> 34:01.297
What, are you crazy? There's money in there.

34:01.365 --> 34:03.765
I just know there's a brick in there,

34:03.833 --> 34:07.002
and I don't want to always be
right about him anymore.

34:07.069 --> 34:09.170
Oh, god, she sounds just like her mother.

34:20.349 --> 34:22.516
H-how much did he say
there was supposed to be?

34:22.583 --> 34:24.619
$20,000.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.795
There's so much money.

34:37.565 --> 34:39.266
So much.

34:39.333 --> 34:44.639
Because I love you two so much, so much.

34:46.808 --> 34:50.411
But it could have been $60,000.

34:52.179 --> 34:53.681
I'm just sayin'.

34:59.820 --> 35:04.324
Okay. Inquiring minds need to know.

35:04.392 --> 35:07.116
Why are you celibate?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.077
- Psycho girlfriend?
- No.

35:09.210 --> 35:10.625
- Religious?
- Mnh-mnh.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.361
Freak bicycle accident? None of the above.

35:13.675 --> 35:16.615
But you've been thinking about
me all day, haven't you?

35:18.491 --> 35:19.664
It was a pickup line?

35:19.749 --> 35:21.625
No. I'm really celibate.

35:21.697 --> 35:25.655
I'm just trying to shut out
the porn-y clamor,

35:25.705 --> 35:26.662
see where it takes me.

35:26.712 --> 35:27.966
I'm sorry.

35:28.104 --> 35:29.643
Porn-y clamor?

35:29.723 --> 35:32.668
Yeah, the ambient noise of sex, Dr. Lin.

35:32.758 --> 35:35.639
What if you stopped trying?

35:35.689 --> 35:36.989
What would happen?

35:37.057 --> 35:41.394
Huh. I'm not sure I want to know.

35:49.368 --> 35:51.003
Hey.

35:51.071 --> 35:53.105
Hi.

35:53.172 --> 35:57.309
Dawn, I've been thinking.

35:57.376 --> 35:58.824
I have, too, Charlie,

35:58.924 --> 36:02.247
and I think that it would be
too complicated.

36:04.617 --> 36:06.684
What?

36:09.622 --> 36:12.992
I saw the way you looked at Alex earlier.

36:15.961 --> 36:18.195
That's over.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.530
Doesn't matter.

36:19.598 --> 36:22.667
I mean, even if it's not with her...

36:22.735 --> 36:25.402
You deserve the real thing.

36:26.705 --> 36:29.107
So do you.

36:32.544 --> 36:34.445
We could never agree
on anything, anyway, right?

36:34.513 --> 36:36.947
I mean, can you imagine us
trying to pick a school?

36:37.015 --> 36:39.416
No. Which would be public, by the way.

36:39.484 --> 36:41.318
I wouldn't send my dead guinea pig to one.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.056
Who are we kidding? Me and kids?

36:46.124 --> 36:48.492
They're just really messy.

36:48.560 --> 36:49.255
Oh, I know.

36:49.364 --> 36:53.163
Bleeding chest cavity, yay,
but dirty diapers...

36:54.384 --> 36:55.871
Hey.

36:57.073 --> 36:58.234
Are you okay?

36:59.737 --> 37:02.139
Yeah, I'm good. I'm great.

37:23.827 --> 37:26.128
See you around, Charlie Harris.

37:36.964 --> 37:38.113
Hey.

37:41.770 --> 37:45.547
Ah, "Aequanimitas," William Osler.

37:45.615 --> 37:47.109
Every doctor should read it.

37:47.195 --> 37:50.852
Yep. It was a graduation present from you.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.255
Right.

37:53.323 --> 37:57.058
I underlined a quote
when I passed my boards.

37:57.126 --> 38:00.161
It says you should bear success
with humility

38:00.229 --> 38:03.464
and be ready when the day
of sorrow and grief comes...

38:04.274 --> 38:06.735
and meet it with the courage
befitting a man.

38:07.974 --> 38:09.303
That's good.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.471
I went to the lab,

38:10.539 --> 38:11.973
and I told them I made a mistake.

38:12.766 --> 38:14.275
You did what?

38:14.343 --> 38:16.244
You're gonna test positive, Sam.

38:16.311 --> 38:18.679
No, no, no. We had it all worked out.

38:18.747 --> 38:21.415
Yeah, well, can't do it.

38:21.483 --> 38:24.352
Yes, you can. You did. It's done.

38:24.419 --> 38:25.272
I can't lie.

38:25.386 --> 38:27.722
Lie? It's not a lie.

38:27.789 --> 38:30.124
Why are you doing this to me?

38:30.191 --> 38:32.626
Oh, this isn't about you.

38:32.693 --> 38:34.995
Okay, people come in here,
and they trust us.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.429
That should mean something.

38:36.497 --> 38:39.133
Mean... what are you, a priest now?

38:39.200 --> 38:43.036
I used to want to be you.

38:43.104 --> 38:45.505
Grow up.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.173
Just did.

38:49.456 --> 38:51.627
I always knew you'd disappoint me.

38:51.727 --> 38:55.348
You're mediocre, Thomas.
You're never gonna be great.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.046
I-I'll tell you what means something is...

38:57.136 --> 39:00.387
is talent and skill...

39:18.638 --> 39:20.906
Just released Cabrera. Pick him up.

39:20.973 --> 39:22.770
Cabrera's the best player in the league.

39:22.879 --> 39:24.427
Why would you let him go?

39:25.077 --> 39:27.479
Well, guess it's my way of apologizing.

39:27.547 --> 39:29.147
Oh. Wow.

39:29.215 --> 39:31.746
Um...

39:34.435 --> 39:35.654
I got a call from the lab saying

39:35.722 --> 39:39.057
that you-you-you re-labeled
Dr. Campbell's test results.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.992
Yeah. I told them it was my bad.

39:41.060 --> 39:43.628
I even told them
that you were right all along.

39:47.533 --> 39:49.835
I-I can't take Cabrera.

39:49.902 --> 39:54.472
Okay.
Right, well, it's done, so...

39:54.540 --> 39:57.809
See, I don't think I'm-I'm...
I'm cut out to be a doctor.

40:00.446 --> 40:03.280
Well, look, you got the brain,

40:03.349 --> 40:06.283
and you're good with a scalpel.

40:06.352 --> 40:10.254
Hey, no hesitation... that's a gift.

40:10.322 --> 40:12.289
Stay the course.

40:14.492 --> 40:16.693
What are you gonna do?

40:19.364 --> 40:21.465
Take some interferon...

40:24.002 --> 40:27.103
take some time off.

40:27.171 --> 40:30.741
Oh, um, if "big papi"
doesn't start producing,

40:30.808 --> 40:33.443
I'd offer him to Zach for encarnacion.

40:38.750 --> 40:41.117
Malcolm?

40:45.923 --> 40:48.491
I was dreaming of Bali.

41:08.181 --> 41:11.146
You almost died trying to help her.

41:11.214 --> 41:13.916
I'm still here.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.552
And so is she.

41:55.324 --> 41:57.458
Alex.

41:57.525 --> 42:00.094
You should be up and walking.

42:00.162 --> 42:02.463
You removed my pants

42:02.530 --> 42:06.800
during the most complex brain
surgery I've ever performed.

42:06.868 --> 42:09.269
Is that a thank-you?

42:11.005 --> 42:13.306
It is.

42:13.374 --> 42:15.676
So, how's our patient?

42:15.743 --> 42:17.410
She's comfortable.

42:17.479 --> 42:20.781
Too soon to tell if the omentum...

42:20.849 --> 42:24.384
she woke up and asked for Malcolm.

42:24.452 --> 42:27.553
Shahir...

42:27.621 --> 42:31.024
You know, I've spent my entire
life studying the brain, Alex.

42:34.862 --> 42:38.364
But the heart is still mysterious to me.

42:38.431 --> 42:42.434
Tell me about it.

42:44.404 --> 42:46.438
You're not staying in my bed, are you?

42:48.108 --> 42:49.742
I don't cuddle.

42:49.810 --> 42:51.577
I know.

42:53.614 --> 42:55.047
Hey.
