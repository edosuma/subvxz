WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.671
Howdy-hi.

00:03.737 --> 00:04.705
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.

00:04.772 --> 00:07.575
Hop in. New guy gets
the back, though.

00:07.641 --> 00:08.676
What do you got there?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.044
A video camera.
I bought it

00:10.111 --> 00:11.579
at a yard sale
down the block.

00:11.645 --> 00:13.247
I'm gonna start
making movies of Hope

00:13.314 --> 00:14.715
so she can
watch 'em someday.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.318
I wish I had a video
camera when I was younger.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.353
Those Jackass guys
make so much money.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.255
But I did all that stuff first.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.956
I drove a lawn mower
into a pool.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.492
I had a Matchbox car inside me.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.262
Not on purpose,
but you wouldn't know it
watching the video.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.563
You know, you're
not gonna use

00:29.630 --> 00:31.732
that video camera
as much as you think.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.834
Oh, keep your hands in the back,
Maw Maw.

00:33.901 --> 00:36.170
It's a back massage,
not a mammogram.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.738
You think it's gonna be
sentimental,

00:37.805 --> 00:40.641
but the truth is it's not,
and everybody looks fat.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.744
You're great-Paw Paw Wilfred
used to get in our faces

00:43.811 --> 00:46.647
with his stupid home
movie camera all the time

00:46.714 --> 00:49.883
and we never watched any
of it, and then he died.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.752
I'm not enjoying that.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.155
What... what the hell...?

00:54.222 --> 00:56.090
Where are...? Who...?

00:56.157 --> 00:57.491
Who are you people?

00:57.558 --> 00:59.993
Wh-why are we touching
each other?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.495
Maw Maw, we're your family,

01:01.562 --> 01:04.232
and we're doing a back-rub train
in your living room.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.634
It was your idea.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.736
I want to be in the front.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.604
No! No way!
I want to be
in the front.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.174
Maw Maw, we already
decided on positions.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.575
I did rock, Virginia
did scissors,

01:14.642 --> 01:16.644
and you did something that
looked like a turtle,

01:16.710 --> 01:19.480
which caused a very long
discussion during which
you spit on me twice.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.082
But then we agreed, by
a vote of two to one,

01:22.150 --> 01:23.151
that rock beats turtle.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.586
Burt, let her get in the front.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.054
No, she always gets
what she wants

01:27.121 --> 01:28.222
just 'cause she's crazy.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.224
Then everybody get out
of my house.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.493
You're only gonna remember
it's your house for two minutes,

01:32.560 --> 01:33.394
and I can wait.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.363
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!

01:35.429 --> 01:37.064
Get out
of my house!

01:37.131 --> 01:38.599
Do you want to get
your camera out

01:38.666 --> 01:39.833
for some of this,
Scorcheesy?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.310
JIMMY:
Oh, come on, Hope.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.011
Shake the rattle for Daddy.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.346
Don't be shy.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.282
Oh, here comes Grandma

01:54.348 --> 01:56.317
to read you your
favorite book.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.652
Oh, no, do not point
that thing at me.

01:58.719 --> 02:02.356
My hair's a wreck,
my shirt is a mess...

02:02.423 --> 02:04.091
(gasps)
You caught me
on bleaching day.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.759
Give me that camera!

02:05.826 --> 02:09.330
That's the real you, and it's
a memory I want her to have!

02:09.397 --> 02:11.932
Well, I do not want
to be filmed like this,

02:11.999 --> 02:14.335
so give me that camera!

02:16.170 --> 02:19.473
She's doing it!
She's doing it!

02:21.975 --> 02:24.011
JIMMY:
Come on.

02:24.077 --> 02:26.547
Put the spaghetti on your head
like you did last week.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.316
You'd look like Bob Marley.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.384
Only you'll be a Pastafarian.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.885
It'll be hilarious.
Come on.

02:31.952 --> 02:34.722
Hey, Jimmy, can you put
that down for a second?

02:34.788 --> 02:37.458
Not now. I think I might finally
get something good here.

02:37.525 --> 02:38.926
It's kind of serious.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.232
I was at the grocery story today
and I saw Sabrina.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.733
She was looking really happy.

02:45.799 --> 02:49.136
And there's no easy way
to say it.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.904
She got engaged to Wyatt.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.045
Oh, man, um...

02:58.111 --> 03:00.248
I just...

03:00.314 --> 03:02.816
(voice breaking):
I thought there'd
be more time.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.987
I-I don't believe this.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.857
It feels like I've been
punched in the gut.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.392
I know.
It's rough.

03:11.459 --> 03:14.862
She asked me
to give you this.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.397
(screaming)

03:16.464 --> 03:18.966
(laughs)
Oh, got ya!

03:19.032 --> 03:20.234
Punk'd and Jackassed.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.202
Two for one, baby!
Two for one!

03:22.270 --> 03:23.837
Oh, wait till
people see this.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.241
(sighs)

03:27.308 --> 03:30.644
Whoa, I think she just gave me
the finger!

03:30.711 --> 03:32.480
I know she doesn't know
what it means,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.448
but how cool. She just
flipped me the baby bird.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.949
Where's my camera?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.953
This is gonna be good!

03:40.020 --> 03:42.290
All right, Jimmy, you have
my permission to tape me

03:42.356 --> 03:45.192
as soon as I get
in the kitchen and
pretend to bake.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.496
Okay. Just want
to get a shot of Hope.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.798
Oh, you got your camera out,
Wilfred.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.533
Ooh, let me do my song.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.635
No, no, no,
Maw Maw, can you
wait a second?

03:54.702 --> 03:56.904
I just... I'm in
the middle of...

03:56.970 --> 03:59.740
MAW MAW:
* Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey? *

03:59.807 --> 04:01.909
Maw Maw, please?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.076
You're
distracting Hope.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.111
* Won't you come home? *

04:04.177 --> 04:06.614
Jimmy swing the
camera around here.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.816
And get me in a full shot.

04:08.882 --> 04:12.786
I got these shoes at a very
wealthy family's garage sale.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.954
Whoo!

04:14.021 --> 04:15.155
Oh, my God!

04:15.222 --> 04:17.024
Did you get it on tape?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.726
I buttered the floor.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.795
Ow, Burt, you really hurt me,
you idiot!

04:21.862 --> 04:22.696
Sorry, baby.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.031
(whispers):
Did you get it on tape?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.999
Mom, are you okay?

04:26.066 --> 04:27.134
Help me up.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.235
(screams)

04:28.302 --> 04:29.603
I got it. I got it.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.139
(both laugh)

04:32.205 --> 04:33.974
I got it!
I got it!

04:34.041 --> 04:35.108
(groaning)

04:35.175 --> 04:37.778
You were right.
It totally worked.

04:37.845 --> 04:41.982
* Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home? *

04:42.049 --> 04:43.317
(groans)

04:43.384 --> 04:45.018
(plays flourish)

04:48.822 --> 04:51.091
Well, I've had the video camera
for a week now

04:51.158 --> 04:52.360
and all I have to show for it

04:52.426 --> 04:54.428
is five hours of
Maw Maw singing

04:54.495 --> 04:56.730
and a bunch
of your Grandpa's stunts.

04:56.797 --> 05:00.368
I call this one,
"Burt Touches Hot Things."

05:05.105 --> 05:06.206
(sizzles)

05:06.273 --> 05:09.042
(screams)

05:11.945 --> 05:13.514
(sizzles)

05:13.581 --> 05:15.749
(high-pitched screaming)

05:17.385 --> 05:18.919
(laughs)

05:29.997 --> 05:31.665
(screams)

05:34.301 --> 05:35.536
(screams)

05:38.672 --> 05:40.040
Anyway, I think
I finally figured out

05:40.107 --> 05:42.643
how to get some good stuff.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.177
Since everybody acts so crazy

05:44.244 --> 05:45.646
when they know
they're being recorded,

05:45.713 --> 05:48.115
the only way to capture
some real memories

05:48.181 --> 05:51.018
with you and your grandparents
is to hide the camera.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.853
VIRGINIA:
* When Jimmy comes
marching home again *

05:52.920 --> 05:54.688
* We're done, we're done. *

05:54.755 --> 05:57.758
BURT: * We love you to death but
it's time for us to have fun *
Oh, hey.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.159
Have you seen
the black light that we use

05:59.226 --> 06:00.628
to check for
counterfeit bills?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.463
Somehow, Frank accepted
a $70 bill

06:02.530 --> 06:04.097
with Ryan Seacrest's face on it.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.199
Yeah, I think it's in
Barney's top drawer.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.135
BOTH:
* We can't do that
till Jimmy comes marching home *

06:08.201 --> 06:09.437
What are you
watching?

06:09.503 --> 06:10.571
Oh, I hid a camera
in my house,

06:10.638 --> 06:12.339
and I got
all this great stuff.

06:12.406 --> 06:15.142
BURT:
* We love you to death but it's
time for us to have fun *

06:15.208 --> 06:17.545
VIRGINIA:
* We'll drink some beers
and we'll order out *

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
* Go to the bedroom
and make you shout *

06:19.913 --> 06:21.849
* But we can't do that *

06:21.915 --> 06:24.217
BOTH:
* Till Jimmy comes
marching home. *

06:24.284 --> 06:25.419
That is so cute.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.854
I know, right?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.490
I should have hidden this
camera, like, a week ago.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.291
I would have gotten
all this great stuff

06:31.358 --> 06:33.427
and my parents wouldn't have
electrocuted me so many times.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.363
Oh, my God,

06:36.430 --> 06:37.465
that's disgusting.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.466
What's disgusting?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.000
Rewind the tape.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.737
Wait. Right there.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.740
(Virginia humming)

06:46.807 --> 06:48.609
Oops.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.613
There we go.

06:52.680 --> 06:53.781
SABRINA:
That.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.949
Oh, my God.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.184
What?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.220
You mother dropped Hope's
pacifier on the ground

07:00.287 --> 07:02.590
and then picked it up
and put it back in her mouth.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.825
So? Five-second rule.
No germs.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.895
You do know the five-second rule
isn't real?

07:10.063 --> 07:12.766
You don't know the five-second
rule isn't real.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.869
In one second, that pacifier
could have picked up cold germs,

07:15.936 --> 07:17.337
flu germs, SARS,
flesh-eating bacteria.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.572
I'm starting to think

07:18.639 --> 07:20.941
you got a little bit
of a germ thing.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.175
No, I don't.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.221
Fine. I may have a little thing
about germs.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.956
Am I proud of it? No.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.258
But do I ignore the facts
that germs run the world

07:38.325 --> 07:40.694
and that we're at their mercy?
No, I do not.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.996
I'm really learning
a lot about you.
Jimmy,

07:43.063 --> 07:44.765
think about it.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.300
Whatever we walk through,
we bring into our homes.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.702
I never thought about that.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.303
My dad works in yards

07:50.370 --> 07:52.105
full of fertilizer
and dog poop.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.808
(gags) Stop it!

07:54.875 --> 07:56.143
That was on the pacifier.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.812
And my mom, she cleans
dirty houses all day.

07:58.879 --> 08:00.581
She... she scrubs
their toilets.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.851
(gags) Stop it!

08:04.885 --> 08:07.688
So you're spying on us?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.422
I don't know
what to say.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.824
I mean, thou shalt
not spy.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.726
That's like one
of the Declarations
of the Independence.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.361
Burt, next time
just stop at

08:14.427 --> 08:15.696
"I don't know
what to say."

08:15.763 --> 08:17.631
You don't need to
prove it to everyone.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.799
JIMMY:
I wasn't spying.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.467
I was trying
to capture memories.

08:20.534 --> 08:21.869
This, this is a big problem,
guys.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.604
I mean, we are talking
about germs.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.706
Germs! Now that Hope's here,

08:25.773 --> 08:27.908
we have to just clean up
our act!

08:27.975 --> 08:31.311
Oh, God! You are not gonna
turn us into

08:31.378 --> 08:33.313
one of those germ-freak families

08:33.380 --> 08:35.983
that thinks their babies
have to live inside a bubble.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.952
Covering everything with that
gross antibacterial goop,
Ugh!

08:39.019 --> 08:40.921
and washing your hands
after going number one?

08:40.988 --> 08:42.990
Never swapping gum? It's crazy.

08:43.056 --> 08:47.127
It is! Babies are the ones
who sit in their poop all day

08:47.194 --> 08:49.029
and put anything they can
touch into their mouths.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.898
They're the disgusting ones.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.265
All right.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.735
What's that?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.069
It's a black light.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.271
We use it at work to check
for counterfeit bills,

08:58.338 --> 09:00.540
but Sabrina says we can also
use it to find germs.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.816
Germs.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.818
So it's a little
dirty. Big deal.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.353
Jimmy, if you think
I'm gonna clean houses

09:13.420 --> 09:15.322
all day and then
come home and...

09:15.388 --> 09:16.389
Germs.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.358
Look, you're overreacting.

09:18.425 --> 09:20.894
Whoa! What the hell
is that?

09:20.961 --> 09:21.995
Germs.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.563
Burt, what have
you been doing

09:23.631 --> 09:24.998
with your fingers?
I don't know.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.434
I mean, other than picking
my nose a little bit

09:27.500 --> 09:28.769
on the way home
from work.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
With all of your fingers?!

09:30.437 --> 09:31.905
I like to mix it up!

09:31.972 --> 09:34.407
Different ones get
to different places.
It's a habit!

09:34.474 --> 09:35.943
I'm not proud of it.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.778
Well, that is just gross.

09:37.845 --> 09:39.079
And I sincerely hope
that the next time you...

09:40.347 --> 09:41.782
What the hell is that?

09:41.849 --> 09:43.684
Germs. Germs you bring home
from cleaning toilets.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.619
That is disgusting.
Turn that off.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.320
Turn that thing off!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.425
Oh, this is even worse.

09:52.492 --> 09:56.029
They're still here,
but we can't see them.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.597
(hushed):
They're hiding.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.900
They're hiding in plain sight.

09:59.967 --> 10:03.203
I never thought I'd say this
on my day off:

10:05.372 --> 10:07.607
Get me a bucket and a mop.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.210
* *

10:22.089 --> 10:26.626
* Everybody is waiting
for everybody to get out *

10:26.694 --> 10:28.829
* And all the pretty people
party *

10:28.896 --> 10:32.599
* While the petty people pout...
whoa-oa-oa *

10:32.666 --> 10:35.936
* Picking it up,
but then I put it back down *

10:36.003 --> 10:38.972
* Picking it up, but then
I put it back down *

10:39.039 --> 10:43.410
* Picking it up,
but then I put it back down *

10:43.476 --> 10:46.446
* Oh-oh, picking it up, but then
I put it back down *

10:46.513 --> 10:49.950
* Picking it up, but then I put
it back down *

10:50.017 --> 10:54.688
* Picking it up, but then
I put it back down *

10:54.755 --> 10:56.456
* Whoa-oh-oh. *

10:56.523 --> 10:58.491
Oh, what's going on?

10:58.558 --> 11:00.761
Now that you got me all
worked up, I'm not gonna trust

11:00.828 --> 11:02.295
your rinky-dink
grocery store black light

11:02.362 --> 11:04.965
to see if we got rid of
all the germs in here.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.901
I borrowed this from my friend
who cleans crime scenes.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.169
Heidi?

11:09.236 --> 11:10.337
How the hell is Heidi?

11:10.403 --> 11:11.504
She's good.

11:11.571 --> 11:13.573
Apparently, the murder business
is recession-proof.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.142
She just bought a PT Cruiser.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.009
Used?

11:16.076 --> 11:18.245
Nope. Certified pre-owned.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.080
Yeah? Good for Heidi.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.949
All right, hit the lights.
Let's see how we did.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.819
(chuckles):
Wow.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.187
We did it.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.088
It's clean.

11:28.155 --> 11:29.322
VIRGINIA:
I don't believe it.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.792
We actually got this
place germ-free.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.762
I got to admit,
it feels pretty good.

11:36.797 --> 11:39.166
(all screaming)

11:44.504 --> 11:46.273
(all screaming)

11:46.339 --> 11:48.008
Keep it down!

11:48.075 --> 11:49.910
I'm gonna take a nap.

11:49.977 --> 11:52.245
My room smells of farts.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.315
Burt, get her off the couch!

11:55.382 --> 11:57.317
Oh, come on.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.218
Oh.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.420
Your room can't be
that bad. Come on.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.756
Oh, good Lord,
she's infecting everything.

12:02.823 --> 12:03.857
Dad, your hands.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.525
(screams)

12:05.592 --> 12:06.827
Ew!

12:06.894 --> 12:08.495
Don't wipe
Maw Maw on me.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.330
Guys, we've got to get her
out of here

12:10.397 --> 12:11.832
before she gets
germs everywhere.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.803
Okay. Come on, Maw Maw.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.470
Why don't we go for a walk.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.672
You can point out
all the things God messed up,

12:19.739 --> 12:21.408
you know, like you like to do.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.243
What was he thinking of,

12:23.310 --> 12:25.846
making up all those
different kinds of trees.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.480
I would've
stopped at pine.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.482
(coughing)

12:36.289 --> 12:37.490
(splash)

12:37.557 --> 12:38.491
(coughs)

12:39.692 --> 12:41.394
Is it bad?

12:41.461 --> 12:44.397
It's not good!

12:47.935 --> 12:49.769
She just touched a spoon.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.371
(groans)

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
No, wait.

12:53.506 --> 12:54.607
She's putting it back

12:54.674 --> 12:56.276
in the drawer. Oh, great.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.211
All the silverware's gonna be
all germed up now.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.847
You can put that on the list.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.114
It's no use even trying.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.115
She's getting herself
on everything.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.583
JIMMY:
What are we gonna do now?

13:03.650 --> 13:05.252
You know, Hope's gonna
wake up in the morning

13:05.318 --> 13:07.687
and one of us is gonna have
to go in there and get her.

13:07.754 --> 13:09.289
We could
rock-paper-scissors for it.

13:09.356 --> 13:10.690
But I need to
know up front

13:10.757 --> 13:11.959
if turtles are allowed,

13:12.025 --> 13:13.961
and if so, where they fall
in the food chain.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.162
It doesn't matter
who goes in there.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.763
This problem is
not gonna go away.

13:16.830 --> 13:20.300
We can't clean fast enough
to keep up with her,

13:20.367 --> 13:22.335
and she's not gonna be
changing her habits.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.004
Okay.

13:24.071 --> 13:28.175
I know this sounds
awful to say,

13:28.241 --> 13:31.611
but under
the circumstances, uh...

13:31.678 --> 13:34.647
I-I mean, I know none of us
would ever dream of it

13:34.714 --> 13:36.016
if it wasn't the only option,

13:36.083 --> 13:38.185
but maybe it's time to consider

13:38.251 --> 13:39.920
if she might not be
better off,

13:39.987 --> 13:41.288
you know...

13:42.923 --> 13:43.991
...in a home.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.459
(both laugh)

13:46.526 --> 13:47.494
Are you crazy?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.997
Jimmy, the woman
tried to bite off

13:50.063 --> 13:51.798
one of your father's toes
while he was sleeping.

13:51.865 --> 13:54.301
You think we haven't tried
to put her in a home?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.368
Seriously?

13:55.435 --> 13:56.703
Of course.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.106
What, you think I want to sleep
in boots the rest of my life?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.140
So what happened?

14:00.207 --> 14:02.075
Well, it turns out,

14:02.142 --> 14:04.544
they don't admit people
who are already senile.

14:04.611 --> 14:07.047
We took her on a day where
she was particularly lucid,

14:07.114 --> 14:09.216
but still didn't go well.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.852
Well, Barbara June,
I see you like to knit.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.721
I love to knit.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.124
It's true.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.059
She knitted me
these socks.
I did.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.494
Yeah, she does so much for us.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.231
It's such a shame we'll have
to lose her to you. (chuckles)

14:24.297 --> 14:26.333
And I see you were in the USO.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.601
Yes, I'm still in the USO.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.337
Really?

14:30.403 --> 14:32.505
Oh.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.075
You still think
you're in the USO?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.345
Once a member, always a member.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.323
(screams)

15:03.170 --> 15:05.072
That man
was on fire.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.776
Well, w-we have to do something.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.645
I'm not gonna raise my daughter
in a house filled with germs.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.748
Maybe we should scrub Maw Maw
down with something stronger.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.418
What does your friend use
to clean up a murder scene?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.220
Well, it's still gonna wear off.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.156
What, are we gonna soak her in
it like combs at a barbershop?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.592
She wouldn't
have to soak in it.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.228
We could just build a mister
with an electric eye,

15:28.295 --> 15:30.130
so she triggers it
every time she walks through.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.932
We can't be the first people
who've had to deal with this.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.934
I bet we could find one
on your Internet.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.037
Well, what if we just
lock her in her room?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.705
I mean, to us,
it's just one room,

15:38.771 --> 15:40.940
but to her, every day
it's a brand-new place.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.111
We can't lock her indoors
for the rest of her life.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.878
That's cruel.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.747
She loves nature.

15:47.814 --> 15:49.983
It's the only thing
as old as she is.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.119
She does love nature.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.587
I think I got it.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.090
And that's when we packed up
all of Maw Maw's stuff

15:57.157 --> 15:59.692
and moved her
to the greenhouse.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.897
So this is what zoos
will be like

16:04.964 --> 16:06.699
when the apes
take over.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.171
Cool.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.578
(heavy breathing)

16:20.513 --> 16:22.649
Ah, it's been great
having her out here.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.917
Now we can finally see
what she's been doing

16:24.984 --> 16:26.453
alone in her room
all the time.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.589
Whoa!

16:29.656 --> 16:30.457
(chuckles)

16:30.523 --> 16:32.292
That was not
expected.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.827
Ah, she used to be a cheerleader
for the Baltimore Colts.

16:34.894 --> 16:36.563
VIRGINIA:
Ah! Damn it!

16:36.629 --> 16:37.797
Burt!

16:37.864 --> 16:39.699
What is wrong
with you?!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.138
Hey, what the hell
happened?

16:45.205 --> 16:48.208
We were trying to move Maw Maw's
trunk out to the greenhouse,

16:48.275 --> 16:49.976
and soon as I picked up my end,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.579
your idiot father decides
to throw a spider on my face.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.214
(laughing):
It wasn't a spider.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.216
It was a daddy longlegs.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.318
And it was already dead.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.087
Her hands were full,

17:00.153 --> 17:01.821
the bug was right there.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.157
Anyone in their right mind
would've done the same thing.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.826
Wouldn't it be easier to move
if you emptied it out first?

17:06.893 --> 17:09.196
We're kind of afraid
to find out what's in there.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.631
They never found
the Limburger baby, you know.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.533
Okay, hold your breath.

17:13.600 --> 17:14.634
I'll open it.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.240
(exhales sharply)

17:20.307 --> 17:22.509
(coughs, groans)

17:25.345 --> 17:26.646
BURT:
What is it?

17:26.713 --> 17:30.150
It's all those stupid movies
Paw Paw made.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.623
Check it out, baby.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.057
Your eighth birthday.

17:38.125 --> 17:40.460
(chuckles)

17:40.527 --> 17:43.896
There she is, Jimmy;
your mom, seven years B.B.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.665
Before Burt.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.069
Hey, there's Maw Maw.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.804
Hey, Maw Maw,
you look great.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.706
BURT:
Yeah, you look like

17:53.773 --> 17:56.276
the horny neighbor
from Mary Tyler Moore.

17:59.279 --> 18:02.615
BURT:
Hey, hey, is that
that Beverly Johnson girl?

18:02.682 --> 18:04.384
Used to play baseball
with her brother Wally.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.685
He had a two-inch belly button.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.920
We used to call him
Wiener Belly Button.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.123
(both laugh)

18:10.190 --> 18:11.424
No, that's not Beverly.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.825
That's Janice Bolton.

18:12.892 --> 18:14.961
She was always talking about
how she was gonna be

18:15.027 --> 18:16.929
way richer than me.

18:16.996 --> 18:20.533
Turns out, she was right
about me not having any money.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.803
On the other hand, she's
dead now, so who won that one?

18:25.772 --> 18:26.739
Mmm!

18:26.806 --> 18:29.008
That's Paula Prozel.

18:29.075 --> 18:32.111
A few years ago, I saw her
fall out of a moving car

18:32.179 --> 18:33.980
in the grocery store
parking lot.

18:34.046 --> 18:35.382
She looked good though.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.421
(gasps softly)

18:41.488 --> 18:43.723
SABRINA:
Whoo, who is the stud

18:43.790 --> 18:45.325
in the suit?

18:45.392 --> 18:49.162
That's my Paw Paw.

18:49.229 --> 18:53.333
He worked seven days a week
and never missed a birthday.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.414
(breathes deeply)

19:09.716 --> 19:11.851
I know you're all looking at me.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.186
(laughs)

19:13.253 --> 19:14.454
Fine, you're all right.

19:14.521 --> 19:15.622
Happy?

19:15.688 --> 19:16.689
(sniffles)

19:16.756 --> 19:18.658
You can tape Hope
all you want, just...

19:18.725 --> 19:20.227
(sniffles)

19:20.293 --> 19:22.329
...not on bleaching day.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.471
VIRGINIA:
Wait a second.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.073
Maw Maw just
licked that knife

19:34.140 --> 19:36.276
and then kept
serving cake with it.

19:40.747 --> 19:42.249
(groans)
Gross.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.598
Oh!
Oh!

19:58.665 --> 20:00.867
Well, there's
your proof.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.270
Our family's been disgusting
for generations.

20:03.336 --> 20:04.271
That's not my point.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.805
How old is Maw Maw now?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.374
Uh, 84.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.342
And how old was
Paw Paw when he died?

20:09.409 --> 20:11.544
90. And he'd still
be here today

20:11.611 --> 20:13.580
if he just would've
worn his bike helmet.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.982
And they hardly
ever got sick.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.551
I haven't been sick since
I was pregnant with you,

20:18.618 --> 20:20.587
and those were
mostly hangovers.

20:20.653 --> 20:24.123
I think the germs in this house
aren't hurting anybody.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.892
Yeah, you're right,
they don't.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.060
Sabrina, uh, you
said your family's

20:28.127 --> 20:29.896
a whole bunch
of clean freaks.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.464
How old's your
great-grandmother?

20:31.531 --> 20:33.165
Oh, she died in her 60s.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.267
Accident?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.635
Uh, respiratory problems.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.370
That's it. Burt, go get Maw Maw.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.771
She's moving back in the house.

20:38.838 --> 20:39.839
Good.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.609
I'd like to get her back
behind solid walls.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.277
People in glass houses
should not throw stones

20:44.344 --> 20:46.346
or sleep naked.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.915
Come on out, Pig-Pen.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.417
We missed you.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.422
Look at that.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.424
You girls loved
your hula hoops.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.058
(chuckles)
Oh, God.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.460
Oh, don't be prissy.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.794
It's just a little spit.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.497
That woman there
is the darn fountain of youth.

21:06.433 --> 21:08.234
Oh, I remember

21:08.301 --> 21:12.772
our neighbor, Eulah Cummings,
used to hate hula hoops.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.774
She thought it was
gonna teach you girls

21:14.841 --> 21:15.908
how to be whores.

21:15.975 --> 21:16.943
(laughs)

21:17.009 --> 21:19.211
Mom, I think
watching this stuff's

21:19.278 --> 21:20.647
making her mind
come back.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.350
Yeah, she does seem
sharp as a tack.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.954
Oh, ice cream! Ooh!

21:28.020 --> 21:30.022
Ooh! (grunting)

21:32.759 --> 21:34.727
(laughing)

21:36.195 --> 21:37.730
CHILD: That was funny.
