WEBVTT

01:56.366 --> 01:57.784
Yeah. Hey, Joanna.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.078
No, it's okay.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.582
What's going on?

02:10.047 --> 02:11.089
What?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.801
When?

02:18.805 --> 02:19.806
Laurie.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.684
Honey.

02:22.768 --> 02:23.852
What?

02:25.896 --> 02:26.897
It's over.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.236
-What?
-He confessed.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.113
Patz.

02:38.617 --> 02:40.577
-I don't...
-Joanna just called.

02:40.661 --> 02:43.080
Leonard Patz hung himself last night.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.083
He left a note for the Rifkins.
It's a full confession.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.669
The cops just confirmed his handwriting.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.214
Are you sure?

02:53.507 --> 02:54.550
Yeah.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.305
I know it doesn't feel real, but it is.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.434
Joanna's moving for a dismissal
first thing this morning.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.727
Oh, my God.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.439
I was so... I thought--

03:09.523 --> 03:10.732
Don't.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.693
Doesn't matter now.

03:13.819 --> 03:14.820
It's over.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.128
Jacob.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.504
Wake up, buddy.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.382
We got something to tell you.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.635
Court, all rise.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.679
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.140
The Honorable Judge French presiding.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.601
This court's now open. Please be seated.

03:47.477 --> 03:50.063
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
at 8:00 a.m. this morning,

03:50.147 --> 03:53.984
the Commonwealth filed a nolle prosequi
announcing its decision

03:54.067 --> 03:56.945
to drop the charges
against the defendant, Jacob Barber.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.908
This is a response
to recent developments in the case

04:00.991 --> 04:02.910
you, no doubt,
will be learning of shortly.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.828
The defendant will please rise.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.918
Young man, I'm sure you're anxious
to get out of here.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.628
So let me be the first to say to you

04:12.711 --> 04:17.466
the words you and your family are,
no doubt, longing to hear.

04:18.050 --> 04:21.136
Jacob Barber, you are now a free man.

04:28.852 --> 04:34.149
Jacob Owen Barber,
in the matter of indictment 08-44-07,

04:34.233 --> 04:37.069
it is ordered by the court that you be
discharged of this indictment

04:37.152 --> 04:38.779
and go without day.

04:38.862 --> 04:42.157
Bail posted shall be returned
to the surety. Case dismissed.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.460
We're gonna conduct an internal review

04:53.544 --> 04:56.004
and issue a more detailed statement
at that time.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.590
Right now, I only want
to express my heartfelt regret

04:58.674 --> 05:01.927
at what both the Rifkin family
and the Barber family have had to endure

05:02.010 --> 05:05.180
and my hope that they both find
some solace in a just outcome.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.473
Thank you. No questions.

05:12.062 --> 05:15.107
Obviously,
we are thrilled with this outcome.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.860
But as you can imagine,
this family has been through a lot.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.737
So we're gonna ask
that you respect their privacy

05:20.821 --> 05:23.991
and allow them to process this ordeal.
Thank you very much.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.284
Jacob, how do you feel?

05:26.827 --> 05:28.078
Great.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.039
Mr. Barber, will you be taking
civil action against the department?

05:34.710 --> 05:37.462
Mrs. Barber, Mrs. Barber, this way!

05:49.850 --> 05:53.187
-Joanna, I don't even have the words.
-Oh, please.

05:53.270 --> 05:56.398
Andy's right. We couldn't have
gotten through any of this without you.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.068
The best I could've done
was a verdict of not guilty.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.404
This is a thousand times better.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.698
This is proof of innocence.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.535
-Congratulations, young man.
-Thank you, Joanna.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.037
I know that this has been rough for you.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.080
But I think that someday
you're gonna realize

06:12.164 --> 06:15.709
that you have experienced something
that very few people ever have.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.004
Dad?

06:19.505 --> 06:21.548
-I know it was you.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:21.632 --> 06:24.635
I know it was you! I know it! I know it!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.845
-Let me go!
-Are you okay?

06:28.931 --> 06:31.975
What do you want me to do with this guy?
Want me to hold him for the cops or what?

06:32.059 --> 06:33.268
No!

06:35.103 --> 06:36.063
No.

06:37.523 --> 06:38.524
Let him go.

06:41.693 --> 06:42.569
Please.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.614
Come on. Get outta here.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.618
He didn't do it, Dan.

06:56.667 --> 06:57.668
You okay, kid?

06:58.377 --> 06:59.545
Who the hell are you?

06:59.628 --> 07:02.631
I'm an old friend of your pop's.
He asked me to look out for you.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.926
Congratulations, by the way.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.220
I guess it was your lucky day, huh, kid?

07:09.137 --> 07:10.264
Get in the car.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.769
I'll call you later.

07:19.565 --> 07:20.732
Thank you.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.526
Anything for old Billy.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.365
Make sure
you give your old man my best, okay?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.901
You're a free man. Attaboy!

08:03.984 --> 08:06.195
Give us a smile, Jacob. A smile.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.162
We're seeing our first images
of the Barber family

08:15.245 --> 08:17.915
as they return to their home
in Newton, Massachusetts

08:17.998 --> 08:20.918
after a remarkable turn of events
in the courtroom.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.588
A trial that has captivated
so many people.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.759
As you can see, there are smiles
on their faces, and who could blame them?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.845
The Barber family can finally
spend some time together

08:31.929 --> 08:34.890
as they celebrate
today's courtroom decision.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.187
I remember that day so clearly.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.733
It all felt so unreal.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.903
It was real.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.489
Of course.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.618
So then? What?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.163
Life just went back to normal?

08:58.664 --> 08:59.748
No.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.960
There was no normal to go back to.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.964
It was just before...

09:10.467 --> 09:11.677
and after.

09:30.153 --> 09:32.823
Hey, honey.
I'm gonna make some coffee. You want some?

09:34.700 --> 09:35.617
Hey.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.661
What's going on?

09:40.998 --> 09:42.416
That day in court,

09:43.292 --> 09:45.752
when Derek read the story,
I was so sure.

09:48.630 --> 09:51.258
In some crazy way, I was almost relieved.

09:53.719 --> 09:55.512
I thought, "At least now I know."

09:58.223 --> 10:00.642
What kind of mother
would think that about her child?

10:01.810 --> 10:05.147
You were under a ton of stress.
We both were.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.445
That story shook me up too.
More than I let on.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.533
You just gotta let it go.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.578
I'm trying.

10:27.711 --> 10:31.215
One thing we knew for sure was that
there was nothing left for us here.

10:32.132 --> 10:35.260
We knew we wanted to start over.
We just had to figure out where.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.722
Laurie got a job offer in Colorado.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.936
She was intrigued.
She just wanted to take it slow.

10:44.603 --> 10:47.356
We figured this story
would follow us everywhere so...

10:48.607 --> 10:50.651
why not get our feet wet here...

10:52.110 --> 10:54.196
where we were wanted least of all.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.491
-Thank you.
-Okay, be right there.

11:00.285 --> 11:04.122
So I got a call from Claudia Hoffman
today confirming our reservation.

11:04.206 --> 11:05.207
For what?

11:06.542 --> 11:09.628
Oh. God, I completely forgot.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.672
-What?
-Mexico.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.842
Wow. Felt like forever ago.

11:14.925 --> 11:17.135
Should've heard how nervous
she sounded on the phone.

11:17.553 --> 11:18.554
Yeah, I bet.

11:18.637 --> 11:22.099
Well, it's Christmas week, so if we
wanna cancel, we need to do it now.

11:25.811 --> 11:26.895
I say we go.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.651
Please do not.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.194
Don't do that.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.913
Hey. Finish your dinner.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.336
So, how are you?

11:52.337 --> 11:53.338
Curious.

11:55.174 --> 11:58.343
You knew we had to have
this conversation sooner or later.

11:58.427 --> 12:01.430
I mean, I suppose
we could've done it on the phone, but--

12:01.513 --> 12:02.806
No, no, it's...

12:03.765 --> 12:04.933
I don't mind.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.186
It's good to see you.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.688
You too, Andy.

12:10.147 --> 12:12.858
Look, I know we can't undo
what we put you through.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.277
I just hope you understand
the position I was in.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.571
You were doing your job.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.158
Anyway, I just want you to know

12:21.241 --> 12:24.661
how much I appreciate the way you've
handled yourself through all of this.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.206
-I didn't do anything.
-Exactly.

12:27.289 --> 12:30.125
But you could've made life very hard
for me and you didn't.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.127
So, thank you.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.966
The last of your stuff.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.969
I kept meaning to send it to you,

12:41.053 --> 12:45.474
but I guess I was just trying to
postpone the inevitable.

12:47.476 --> 12:48.852
You know, you could just stay.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.482
Is that something you would ever consider?
Coming back?

12:54.483 --> 12:55.567
No. Not really.

12:55.651 --> 12:58.737
If I said Neal Logiudice is thinking about
transitioning to the private sector.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.155
It's not about that.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.661
I just can't do it anymore.

13:08.247 --> 13:10.123
Not after being on the other side.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.251
You sure?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.963
Yeah. Very.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.757
All right. Fair enough.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.008
I had to ask.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.763
For what it's worth, I think you should
try and hang on to Neal.

13:26.348 --> 13:27.558
Good lawyer.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.894
Picked up a few bad habits,
but maybe this was a wake-up call for him.

13:31.895 --> 13:35.107
Right. Well, either way,
I'm gonna keep you on the payroll

13:35.190 --> 13:36.984
until you figure out your next move,

13:37.067 --> 13:39.736
so you should take
however long you need.

13:41.238 --> 13:42.322
I intend to.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.366
All right.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.828
-Well, you'll give Laurie my best?
-Of course.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.957
Oh, I almost forgot. The cops finally
wrapped up the Patz investigation.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.293
I thought they already had.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.962
I don't know. I guess there were
a few things that didn't totally add up.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.797
Some minor details.
You know how these things are.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.466
But it's closed now.
I thought you'd wanna know.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.261
Yeah. Thank you.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.202
You don't wanna be a tough guy tonight,
believe me.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.591
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.926
How'd it go with Lynn?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.179
It's fine. She sends her best.

14:47.888 --> 14:48.931
Yeah, right.

14:50.182 --> 14:51.225
Do you like this one?

14:51.850 --> 14:53.435
Yeah. Yeah, it's nice.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.395
They have it at the mall in Worcester.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.232
It's a drive.

14:58.315 --> 15:01.318
But I was thinking I could take Jake
with me tomorrow, make a day of it.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.612
He's outgrown all his swim stuff.

15:04.404 --> 15:07.157
Wanna join? You could use a new suit too.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.872
No, I actually have that Skype
with the firm in Boulder.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.208
Really? That's great.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.295
Yeah. Yeah, we'll see.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.633
What about this one?
Not in pink. Just the style.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.052
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.220
It's nice.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.695
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.368
Come on.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.129
Did you do it?

16:05.757 --> 16:06.884
Do what?

16:06.967 --> 16:09.052
Father O'Leary, your buddy.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.014
O'Leary? Never heard of him.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.140
Bullshit.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.225
He did a bid in here with you.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.855
A lot of guys come through here.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.656
Just tell me.

16:33.202 --> 16:36.163
I just told you.
I don't know what you're talking about--

16:36.246 --> 16:37.748
Don't fucking lie to me!

16:37.831 --> 16:40.584
-Hey, man, I'm trying to talk here.
-Wanna keep it down, man?

16:47.591 --> 16:51.345
I read the police report from
the crime scene at Patz's apartment.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.973
Yeah, the kiddie-raper?

16:56.517 --> 16:57.559
What about him?

17:03.524 --> 17:04.650
Jesus Christ.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.281
You did it. Didn't you?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.747
I still don't know
what you're talking about.

17:30.092 --> 17:33.178
The neighbors said they saw a car
hanging out around the complex that night.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.640
An old Lincoln.

17:37.391 --> 17:38.767
No plates.

17:40.686 --> 17:43.480
She thought it was black, but it was
too dark outside to know for sure.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.404
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

17:50.487 --> 17:52.906
You know exactly what it means.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.533
I don't know shit.

17:55.284 --> 17:58.287
Except some piece
of human fucking garbage got his.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.008
I don't know
what you're so broken up about.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.177
One less animal in the world.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.223
We didn't need you.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.225
You sure about that?

18:21.560 --> 18:22.895
Kid practically confessed.

18:22.978 --> 18:23.979
He was innocent.

18:24.062 --> 18:25.230
I don't give a shit.

18:26.899 --> 18:28.609
I don't care if he did it or not.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.446
You want your kid to spend
the rest of his life

18:32.529 --> 18:34.072
in some fucking place like this?

18:37.701 --> 18:38.827
This fucking grave?

18:42.789 --> 18:45.709
Now, I'm not saying I even know
what you're talking about here,

18:45.792 --> 18:50.339
but it sounds like whatever happened...

18:52.508 --> 18:53.926
was for the best.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.887
And if you can't see that...

18:58.388 --> 19:00.766
maybe you're not as smart
as I thought you were.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.687
I can't... I can't let you--

19:05.771 --> 19:06.897
Careful, boy.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.332
You wanna throw him back to the wolves?

19:27.334 --> 19:30.254
Tell the cops this crazy fucking story.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.674
Maybe they believe you.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.344
And then what?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.687
You can be a good man.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.234
Or you can be a good father.

19:55.654 --> 19:57.197
Me, I'm neither.

19:57.823 --> 19:58.907
I know that.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.705
But you get to choose.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.516
It's been good seeing you, son.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.522
Gettin' to know you a little.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.028
I know this is probably it
for you and me.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.280
But...

20:40.699 --> 20:41.909
tell the boy...

20:45.996 --> 20:47.915
if he ever wants to meet his grandpa...

20:50.501 --> 20:51.877
he knows where to find me.

21:53.438 --> 21:55.691
-Oh, my God. That is so gross.
-Hey, Dad.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.610
Hey. How was your Skype?

21:59.194 --> 22:00.529
They had to reschedule.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.240
Oh, that's annoying.
You could've come with us.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.826
Hey, tell your dad
that one you just told me.

22:07.661 --> 22:10.163
Why was the cannibal
disappointed by the restaurant?

22:10.247 --> 22:11.248
Why?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.624
It's called Five Guys.

22:14.001 --> 22:15.002
You eaten?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.295
No, not yet.

22:28.891 --> 22:30.017
Did you try it on?

22:32.978 --> 22:34.104
The swimsuit I bought you.

22:35.439 --> 22:36.481
Yeah.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.401
And?

22:39.818 --> 22:40.777
I like it.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.447
You told me you like it. Does it fit?

22:43.906 --> 22:46.533
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It fits great.
Thank you.

22:50.037 --> 22:52.331
Jake thought it'd be funny
if I bought you a Speedo.

22:59.838 --> 23:00.839
You okay?

23:02.466 --> 23:03.800
Yeah. Why?

23:04.676 --> 23:08.514
I don't know. You seemed
kind of out of it tonight, even at dinner.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.849
Well, I'm fine. Just...

23:15.771 --> 23:17.231
Just got a lot on my mind.

23:17.606 --> 23:18.607
Like what?

23:19.650 --> 23:21.735
The move and career.

23:24.613 --> 23:25.781
And what about it?

23:32.621 --> 23:36.875
I don't know. Just part of me feels like
we should get out now, you know?

23:36.959 --> 23:39.336
It doesn't have to be Colorado.
We can go anywhere.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.380
I thought you like Colorado.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.257
-No, I do. I like Colorado.
-We don't have to go there.

23:43.340 --> 23:44.675
It's not that. I just--

23:45.968 --> 23:47.135
I think I'm ready.

23:52.683 --> 23:55.936
All the waiting around
is just getting to me. That's all.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.772
Okay.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.945
I think I'm ready too.

24:06.864 --> 24:10.492
When we get back, we can put
the house on the market, make a plan.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.035
Yeah?

24:12.786 --> 24:13.620
Yeah.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.918
I wish you'd said something sooner.

24:21.211 --> 24:23.589
Well, I didn't want to rush you.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.632
Doesn't mean we couldn't talk about it.

24:26.258 --> 24:29.303
We agreed. This is how it's gonna be now.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.305
No more secrets.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.269
It's "FUNintheSUN."

25:20.437 --> 25:21.438
What?

25:21.522 --> 25:23.065
The Wi-Fi password.

25:23.148 --> 25:25.067
It's "FUNintheSUN." All one word.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.568
"Fun" and "sun" are in caps.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.570
Thank you.

25:32.157 --> 25:33.325
Can I ask?

25:34.409 --> 25:36.995
Are you... Jacob Barber?

25:40.457 --> 25:41.458
Yeah.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.044
Wow.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.713
I mean, I thought so,
but I wasn't entirely sure.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.800
It must be kind of weird
getting recognized.

25:55.305 --> 25:56.306
Andy, look.

25:59.726 --> 26:00.894
Yeah, I bet.

26:05.816 --> 26:06.817
All set.

26:07.693 --> 26:08.694
Thank you.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.124
So how was Mexico?

26:22.207 --> 26:23.876
It was everything we hoped for.

26:25.043 --> 26:26.211
It was paradise.

26:45.731 --> 26:46.940
What?

26:49.026 --> 26:50.861
Stop it. It's embarrassing.

26:51.695 --> 26:53.113
You just seem so content.

26:53.614 --> 26:54.615
I am.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.703
I'm gonna grab another one of these.
You want one?

27:00.454 --> 27:02.414
Seriously? It's not even noon.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.171
Andy, look.

27:14.134 --> 27:15.511
She seems so sweet.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.263
I've always liked that name, "Hope."

27:19.181 --> 27:21.934
Apparently, she's an older woman.
Sixteen.

27:27.564 --> 27:28.815
You said you met the mom?

27:28.899 --> 27:31.902
Yeah, at the fitness center.
They're from Toronto.

27:33.654 --> 27:36.240
And... she knows?

27:38.283 --> 27:39.618
I have to assume.

27:41.036 --> 27:42.204
Seemed okay with it.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.587
Sure you don't want another one?

27:51.129 --> 27:52.256
Maybe later.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.876
Let's talk about Hope Connors...

28:29.793 --> 28:31.503
the girl that Jacob met at the hotel.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.339
From what I understand,
they spent a lot of time together.

28:35.424 --> 28:36.466
Some.

28:36.550 --> 28:38.093
She posted a picture of the two of them.

28:38.927 --> 28:40.888
Caused a lot of excitement back home.

28:41.471 --> 28:43.974
I guess Jacob was something
of a celebrity.

28:46.685 --> 28:48.770
Do you know if they spoke about his case?

28:49.855 --> 28:50.856
I have no idea.

28:51.690 --> 28:52.900
But it's possible.

28:54.151 --> 28:56.153
He may have even confided in her.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.405
I just said I had no idea.

29:00.616 --> 29:02.159
And there was nothing to confide.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.706
Tell me about New Year's Eve.

29:12.252 --> 29:13.879
So it's a party?

29:13.962 --> 29:17.174
It's more like a bonfire, I think.
It's just down the beach.

29:17.716 --> 29:18.884
But past the hotel?

29:18.967 --> 29:21.220
Yeah, but, I mean, just past.

29:24.556 --> 29:26.141
Hope says it's really close.

29:27.309 --> 29:28.727
Her parents are okay with it?

29:28.810 --> 29:31.813
Yeah. I don't think
we'll be out that late anyways.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.148
Oh, I know you won't.

29:33.982 --> 29:35.776
So, then... yes?

29:39.071 --> 29:42.282
You need to text us when you get there
and when you leave. Understand?

29:42.950 --> 29:43.784
Okay.

29:44.201 --> 29:45.202
I mean it.

29:45.285 --> 29:46.954
Yes. Thanks.

29:53.502 --> 29:54.503
It was...

29:55.504 --> 29:58.423
Danny something.

29:58.507 --> 29:59.925
With the big glasses. Harkaway?

30:00.008 --> 30:02.386
-Harkavey.
-Harkavey! Yes!

30:02.469 --> 30:04.221
-Didn't he work for DWP?
-Yeah, he did.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.850
And anytime anybody asked, he'd say,
"I clean the water that you drink."

30:07.933 --> 30:09.184
Oh, my God.

30:09.643 --> 30:11.103
God, he was so weird.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.564
That was such a great apartment though.

30:14.565 --> 30:15.816
Feels like a lifetime ago.

30:16.316 --> 30:17.317
It really does.

30:24.950 --> 30:25.951
We're here.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.203
We made it.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.461
Should I order another bottle?

30:39.464 --> 30:41.049
Only if we can bring it up to the room.

30:44.761 --> 30:46.096
You sure that's when it was?

30:46.180 --> 30:49.683
It wasn't. I know it was on our honeymoon
because I was already--

30:58.859 --> 30:59.860
Hi.

31:00.777 --> 31:02.654
I thought you were gonna text us
before you left.

31:03.322 --> 31:04.990
Yeah. Sorry, I forgot.

31:07.367 --> 31:08.827
You guys have fun at the party?

31:10.913 --> 31:12.247
She was more into it than me.

31:13.624 --> 31:15.417
-How was dinner?
-It was really nice.

31:17.127 --> 31:18.629
Didn't you have your white shirt on?

31:20.088 --> 31:21.673
I left it at the beach by accident.

31:21.757 --> 31:24.009
You guys didn't wanna hang out downstairs,
watch the fireworks?

31:24.843 --> 31:26.595
No. She stayed actually.

31:26.678 --> 31:27.763
At the beach?

31:28.680 --> 31:30.224
Her parents were okay with that?

31:30.307 --> 31:32.518
I guess. She said she'd text them.

31:33.727 --> 31:34.895
Trouble in paradise?

31:37.606 --> 31:39.566
You know, you and Hope.

31:41.151 --> 31:43.612
No, not really. I just don't like parties

31:43.695 --> 31:46.073
with drunk idiots
and shitty music, that's all.

31:49.993 --> 31:53.038
Well, we're gonna watch the ball drop
in our room. You wanna join us?

31:53.747 --> 31:55.040
It's okay. I'm good.

31:55.749 --> 31:56.875
All right.

31:57.668 --> 31:59.002
Happy New Year, sweetheart.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.379
-Happy New Year, pal.
-You too.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.658
-Mrs. Barber?
-Yes?

32:29.741 --> 32:32.035
The police like to have a word
with your son.

32:35.914 --> 32:38.667
-I'm sorry, what is this regarding?
-It's about a missing person.

32:40.711 --> 32:41.962
Hold on, hold on.

32:42.754 --> 32:44.590
They have to take your cards, ma'am.

32:44.673 --> 32:46.466
-They're asking where is your husband--
-I don't understand.

32:46.550 --> 32:48.177
-Hey, hey, hey! What's going on?
-Andy.

32:48.260 --> 32:50.596
-Hey, hey, hey.
-It's okay. It's my family.

32:50.679 --> 32:51.680
It's okay.

32:53.473 --> 32:54.474
What's going on?

32:55.642 --> 32:59.146
Hope Connors didn't come back last night.
The police want to talk to Jacob.

33:01.023 --> 33:02.733
-We have to take him right now. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.401
-Okay, okay. Come on, Jacob.
-Please, follow me.

33:04.943 --> 33:06.361
-Please, this way.
-Okay.

33:40.896 --> 33:43.273
What time did Jacob say
he had last seen her?

33:45.692 --> 33:48.195
It was around 8:00, 8:15.

33:49.363 --> 33:53.575
He said that... they got in
an argument on the way to the party.

33:53.659 --> 33:54.993
Something stupid.

33:55.077 --> 33:58.372
She liked an actor that he didn't,
and it got awkward.

33:59.623 --> 34:02.835
And then he just decided
he didn't want to stay.

34:03.544 --> 34:05.587
And she did. So he left.

34:06.922 --> 34:08.047
And did you believe him?

34:08.507 --> 34:09.507
Of course.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.885
-Did Laurie?
-Yes.

34:11.969 --> 34:14.179
-Right away or--
-We both believed him.

34:15.264 --> 34:16.473
What about the police?

34:19.935 --> 34:23.272
They thought he was lying.
They thought we were covering for him.

34:26.692 --> 34:28.819
They questioned us for about three hours.

34:30.320 --> 34:34.157
The great white shark,
also known as the great white...

34:35.367 --> 34:38.036
Took our passports,
asked us not to leave the hotel.

34:40.289 --> 34:44.333
...which can be found in the coastal
surface waters of all the major oceans.

34:45.293 --> 34:47.795
The great white shark is notable
for its size.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.757
By the time we went to bed,
she had been missing for 24 hours.

34:56.138 --> 34:57.681
I can't believe this is happening.

35:03.729 --> 35:04.771
His shirt...

35:08.150 --> 35:09.776
He said he left it at the beach.

35:10.777 --> 35:11.612
Yeah?

35:15.991 --> 35:16.992
Nothing.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.203
It's nothing.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.026
Andy.

36:34.361 --> 36:35.779
What are you doing out here?

36:37.823 --> 36:38.657
Hey.

36:47.416 --> 36:48.667
I didn't know.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.045
About what?

36:54.798 --> 36:55.799
It's all right.

36:57.050 --> 36:58.719
Whatever it is, we can talk about it.

37:02.890 --> 37:04.183
Did Jacob say something to you?

37:09.563 --> 37:10.564
Then tell me.

37:12.232 --> 37:13.650
Leonard Patz.

37:16.945 --> 37:17.863
What?

37:19.865 --> 37:21.408
He didn't kill himself.

37:23.785 --> 37:25.287
It was my father.

37:29.082 --> 37:30.209
That's impossible.

37:36.340 --> 37:37.591
How could he--

37:42.638 --> 37:44.306
Oh, my God. The Lincoln.

37:46.433 --> 37:47.893
It was that man.

37:49.811 --> 37:50.854
He killed him?

37:53.315 --> 37:54.399
Oh, my God.

37:55.484 --> 37:56.485
Oh, my God.

37:57.152 --> 38:00.155
-Then Jacob was never really innocent.
-It doesn't mean that.

38:00.239 --> 38:02.074
Of course it means that.

38:02.157 --> 38:05.911
Of course it does.
Why else would you be telling me this?

38:07.412 --> 38:08.705
Do the police know?

38:08.789 --> 38:10.207
Nobody knows.

38:13.043 --> 38:14.378
At least not yet.

38:16.171 --> 38:18.757
You think he had something
to do with Hope.

38:18.841 --> 38:19.883
Oh, my God.

38:20.342 --> 38:21.426
I don't know.

38:31.812 --> 38:33.856
Do you want me to tell the police?

38:44.700 --> 38:46.118
Laurie. Laurie.

38:46.451 --> 38:47.953
No. I need to go inside.

38:56.336 --> 38:57.379
And then?

38:58.672 --> 38:59.798
Then they found her.

39:16.899 --> 39:19.151
Police said she had met some guy
at the party.

39:19.234 --> 39:20.861
He slipped something in her drink.

39:20.944 --> 39:21.945
Hope!

39:28.493 --> 39:30.495
Took her back to his place.

39:30.579 --> 39:32.998
Luckily,
his buddy panicked and called the cops.

39:34.833 --> 39:36.043
You must have been relieved.

39:38.212 --> 39:39.296
Everyone was.

39:41.632 --> 39:42.883
Even Laurie?

39:44.343 --> 39:45.469
What do you think?

39:45.552 --> 39:48.972
I think finding yourselves
in such an eerily similar situation

39:49.056 --> 39:52.643
must have dredged up
a lot of old anxieties.

39:53.602 --> 39:54.895
Lot of old fears.

39:55.938 --> 39:59.525
You flew home the same afternoon.
Skipped the last three days of your trip.

39:59.608 --> 40:00.442
So?

40:00.526 --> 40:02.569
I'd have thought you would have had
cause to celebrate.

40:02.653 --> 40:03.946
Jacob was exonerated.

40:06.406 --> 40:07.658
We just wanted to go home.

40:19.294 --> 40:21.713
-Do you want to talk about what happened?
-No.

40:24.800 --> 40:25.801
When then?

40:27.010 --> 40:29.763
I don't know. Maybe never.

40:47.573 --> 40:48.740
He called them Job stories.

40:48.824 --> 40:51.994
Did Job post a story
about the murder of Ben Rifkin?

40:52.077 --> 40:54.413
"If Brent knew the real Jason,
he would have been scared shitless.

40:54.496 --> 40:55.956
He curled his fingers around the grip

40:56.039 --> 40:58.667
and felt a surge of power through his arm,
up into his shoulder.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.795
Brent saw the knife coming for him, but
it was too late to do anything but stare.

41:01.879 --> 41:04.047
It slipped in so easily,
Jason thought he was stabbing air.

41:04.131 --> 41:06.675
He did it twice more, telling his brain
to remember the feeling."

41:06.758 --> 41:10.262
What if you knew in your heart
that our son did this unforgivable thing?

41:10.345 --> 41:12.181
"He went down to Brent's body
to make sure he was dead.

41:12.264 --> 41:13.891
The smell of blood in the air
made him feel dizzy."

41:13.974 --> 41:18.812
What if I just didn't look closely enough?
Then in a way, isn't this all my fault?

41:49.635 --> 41:53.305
Do you understand
the cell division process?

42:01.605 --> 42:02.606
Okay.

42:08.028 --> 42:09.530
Yeah. I think so.

42:21.583 --> 42:23.585
Something changed in Mexico.

42:23.669 --> 42:25.921
Something happened to Laurie.

42:30.717 --> 42:32.010
This is ridiculous.

42:32.094 --> 42:34.930
You put your house on the market
less than two weeks after you got home.

42:35.013 --> 42:36.139
That was always the plan.

42:36.223 --> 42:38.350
Neither one of you had a job
waiting for you in Colorado.

42:38.433 --> 42:40.102
You hadn't even decided where to live.

42:40.185 --> 42:43.230
-So?
-So? What were you running from?

42:43.313 --> 42:46.567
What changed?
What happened between you and Laurie?

42:46.650 --> 42:48.110
Nothing. I just told you.

42:48.193 --> 42:50.779
Then why isn't she here today, Andy?

42:56.451 --> 42:57.953
Why isn't Laurie here today?

43:09.715 --> 43:12.467
-I have to run some errands.
-Okay.

43:14.928 --> 43:16.638
Hey, remember this?

43:20.976 --> 43:22.019
I'll be back later.

43:38.994 --> 43:41.580
Have you just been secretly honing
your Othello skills?

43:43.373 --> 43:45.417
It's all about taking the corners.
You taught me that.

43:47.169 --> 43:48.253
Yes.

43:51.715 --> 43:54.426
Where'd you say Mom went again?
Kind of hungry.

43:55.093 --> 43:57.513
She just ran out to grab a few things.
She'll be back soon.

44:02.226 --> 44:03.560
What's going on with her?

44:06.980 --> 44:07.981
What do you mean?

44:10.651 --> 44:14.780
She just seems really...
I don't know, more quiet than usual.

44:17.115 --> 44:19.535
Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

44:19.910 --> 44:21.662
You know, packing and the move.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.918
I think we just gotta give her time.

44:39.888 --> 44:40.889
What?

44:44.017 --> 44:45.060
It's your turn.

44:52.818 --> 44:54.069
I can't find a move.

44:57.030 --> 44:58.240
It's 'cause you don't have one.

46:55.274 --> 46:56.275
Laurie?

47:07.536 --> 47:09.371
I didn't know you were down here.

47:09.454 --> 47:11.832
Yeah. Lot of stuff to go through.

47:14.877 --> 47:16.253
I was gonna go to bed.

47:16.753 --> 47:17.921
Okay.

47:19.381 --> 47:22.593
Jake's overdue for a haircut.
If you want, I can take him tomorrow.

47:23.468 --> 47:24.553
No, I can go.

47:24.887 --> 47:27.472
-You sure? I don't mind doing it.
-No, I know what to tell him.

47:28.348 --> 47:29.391
Okay.

47:32.561 --> 47:34.062
I think he's worried about you.

47:36.940 --> 47:37.941
So am I.

47:41.111 --> 47:42.696
I don't know what you want me to say.

47:42.779 --> 47:44.239
Nothing. Just...

47:48.952 --> 47:50.579
It's like living with a ghost.

47:52.372 --> 47:54.625
-I don't know if you're punishing me or--
-I'm not.

47:55.375 --> 47:56.376
Then what is it?

48:04.843 --> 48:06.136
The way that you look at him...

48:11.642 --> 48:13.852
I'm just trying to figure out
how to move on from here.

48:18.023 --> 48:19.483
Isn't that what we're doing?

48:20.943 --> 48:21.902
Laurie...

48:31.411 --> 48:32.913
If you just want to take some time...

48:33.997 --> 48:36.542
by yourself, the move can wait.

48:39.419 --> 48:42.130
Just want to get away and...

48:44.383 --> 48:45.676
decide what you wanna do.

48:47.761 --> 48:48.679
Maybe.

48:51.598 --> 48:52.975
Okay.

48:53.058 --> 48:54.101
Whatever you need.

48:55.727 --> 48:56.728
I mean it.

49:03.110 --> 49:04.319
I love you, Laurie.

49:07.489 --> 49:09.366
I know that might not mean much...

49:10.826 --> 49:11.869
but I do.

50:17.559 --> 50:19.102
I don't want to go too short.

50:19.186 --> 50:23.065
Just, like, trim around the ears
and the back, like last time.

50:24.650 --> 50:25.651
Sure.

50:32.824 --> 50:34.076
I'm trying to remember.

50:37.538 --> 50:39.581
Last year, when it was all happening...

50:40.874 --> 50:43.418
I don't think I ever just asked you.

50:43.961 --> 50:45.212
Not directly.

50:46.713 --> 50:49.383
I guess I was just scared
of what they might do to you.

50:51.093 --> 50:52.719
But they can't hurt you now.

50:53.595 --> 50:54.721
No one can.

51:36.847 --> 51:38.849
Still, would you have told me the truth?

51:39.808 --> 51:43.812
If I promised to love you no matter what,
would you tell me?

51:45.772 --> 51:46.773
Jacob.

51:50.235 --> 51:51.278
Did you kill Ben?

51:54.531 --> 51:55.532
What?

51:56.450 --> 51:57.701
No. You know I didn't.

51:59.578 --> 52:01.246
What if I said I don't believe you?

52:02.497 --> 52:05.000
-What?
-A man died, Jacob.

52:05.083 --> 52:06.919
You don't know this,
but a man was murdered

52:07.002 --> 52:08.670
so that you could go free.

52:08.754 --> 52:10.422
-So I have to know.
-Know what?

52:10.506 --> 52:12.466
Did you kill Ben? Just tell me the truth,

52:12.549 --> 52:14.635
-I did tell you. What's wrong with you?
-I will love you no matter what.

52:14.718 --> 52:16.094
I don't believe you.

52:18.639 --> 52:19.973
Mom, you're driving too fast.

52:20.057 --> 52:21.725
Why would you write that story?

52:21.808 --> 52:24.019
-Mom, slow down.
-All the details, the little things.

52:24.102 --> 52:25.479
I made it up. Slow down.

52:25.562 --> 52:27.314
I don't think you did. I'm sorry.

52:29.191 --> 52:30.484
If I just knew the truth.

52:30.567 --> 52:32.110
I made it up. Just slow down!

52:33.320 --> 52:34.488
Mom, slow down!

52:34.571 --> 52:36.031
If I only knew what happened.

52:36.114 --> 52:38.408
-Fine! I killed him, okay?
-You did?

52:39.159 --> 52:40.994
Whatever you want! Just slow down, please.

52:42.037 --> 52:44.998
-I want the truth.
-Slow down. Slow down, Mom.

52:45.707 --> 52:46.959
But I'll never know, will I?

52:47.042 --> 52:48.544
-Just slow down.
-I will never know.

52:48.627 --> 52:50.462
-Mom!
-I will never know.

52:50.546 --> 52:51.964
Mom, you're driving too fast.

52:52.047 --> 52:54.132
-I can't do it anymore, Jacob.
-You sound crazy!

52:54.216 --> 52:56.176
-I can't do it.
-Mom, you're scaring me. Slow down.

52:56.260 --> 52:57.427
Mom, please!

52:57.511 --> 52:58.804
-I love you.
-Please!

52:58.887 --> 53:00.430
-I love you and your father both.
-Mom!

53:00.514 --> 53:01.932
Stop! Mom!

53:02.015 --> 53:03.016
Mom!

54:00.324 --> 54:01.950
I need to ask you again.

54:04.411 --> 54:06.246
Why isn't Laurie here today?

54:09.458 --> 54:12.211
On February 22, nearly six weeks ago,

54:12.294 --> 54:15.881
you received a call from the Massachusetts
State Police. Is that correct?

54:17.090 --> 54:18.842
You were told
that there had been an accident.

54:19.384 --> 54:23.305
That Laurie and Jacob were in a car
that had gone off the road.

54:23.764 --> 54:25.432
That both mother and son had been rushed

54:25.516 --> 54:28.393
to the intensive care unit
of Newton General.

54:31.355 --> 54:35.984
The officer explained that
there were no other cars involved.

54:37.069 --> 54:39.821
That there were witnesses,
other drivers,

54:39.905 --> 54:43.033
who saw your wife's car
swerve suddenly off the road.

54:43.116 --> 54:45.869
-She was speeding.
-I'm sorry?

54:45.953 --> 54:50.082
I said she was speeding. It was raining,
and she was driving too fast.

54:50.415 --> 54:53.502
None of these witnesses reported
seeing any attempt by the driver

54:53.585 --> 54:55.295
to right the vehicle or apply the brake.

54:55.379 --> 54:57.339
She was speeding, and she lost control.

54:57.422 --> 54:59.967
Did she? Lose control?

55:00.384 --> 55:01.802
That's not what I meant.

55:01.885 --> 55:04.638
Joanna Klein, Jacob's prior attorney...

55:05.681 --> 55:08.517
told investigators that she received
two missed calls from your wife

55:08.600 --> 55:11.979
between the hours of 4:00 and 5:00 a.m.
on the morning of the crash.

55:12.062 --> 55:13.272
Both hang-ups.

55:13.355 --> 55:16.108
Why do you suppose she was trying
to get in touch with Jacob's attorney?

55:16.191 --> 55:18.151
I don't know. Joanna is a friend.

55:18.235 --> 55:19.903
Is Elizabeth Vogel a friend?

55:19.987 --> 55:23.365
Phone records show that there was a call
from Laurie's phone

55:23.448 --> 55:27.077
to Dr. Vogel's office at 3:18 a.m.

55:27.911 --> 55:30.372
This sounds to me like a woman
who was distraught.

55:31.373 --> 55:33.542
Did she get any sleep at all that night?

55:36.211 --> 55:37.254
Andy.

55:39.298 --> 55:43.218
You said you wanted the truth to come out,
but you're not telling the truth.

55:43.302 --> 55:45.053
Yes, I am. It was an accident.

55:45.137 --> 55:47.014
It was not an accident.

55:47.097 --> 55:50.017
She tried to kill her son. Your son.

55:52.436 --> 55:55.480
I understand
why you don't want to help us.

55:57.816 --> 55:59.610
But Jacob is owed justice.

56:03.197 --> 56:05.949
Nobody here blames you, Andy.

56:06.742 --> 56:10.370
You're a victim,
but you need to be strong.

56:11.330 --> 56:14.583
You would do anything for your son,
I know that.

56:14.666 --> 56:16.001
No matter how painful.

56:24.092 --> 56:25.093
Help us.

56:28.013 --> 56:31.141
Help us deliver justice.

56:32.851 --> 56:34.645
That's all we want.

56:35.771 --> 56:38.440
Justice for Jacob.

56:39.942 --> 56:40.943
For you.

56:49.284 --> 56:50.285
Andy.

56:56.708 --> 56:58.168
She was speeding.

57:01.463 --> 57:02.673
It was raining.

57:04.174 --> 57:05.467
And it was an accident.

57:20.899 --> 57:22.025
There's a decision.

58:42.814 --> 58:43.815
Hey, pal.

59:27.234 --> 59:28.277
All good.

59:51.633 --> 59:52.634
Well?

59:53.594 --> 59:54.595
They voted.

59:59.516 --> 1:00:00.517
No bill.

1:00:02.686 --> 1:00:03.896
What does that mean?

1:00:06.190 --> 1:00:07.608
It means no indictment.

1:00:07.691 --> 1:00:09.651
It means they know it was an accident.

1:00:11.153 --> 1:00:14.865
-Really? Are they sure?
-Yeah.

1:00:30.464 --> 1:00:32.174
I went to see him again today.

1:00:32.883 --> 1:00:33.926
I read to him.

1:00:37.638 --> 1:00:39.640
The nurse says they're optimistic.

1:00:40.390 --> 1:00:42.392
-They're seeing some encouraging signs.
-Yeah.

1:00:43.143 --> 1:00:44.228
They are.

1:00:49.233 --> 1:00:50.609
When he wakes up,

1:00:51.401 --> 1:00:53.070
what if he thinks that I...

1:01:00.911 --> 1:01:01.912
He won't.

1:01:03.956 --> 1:01:07.709
I keep trying to remember that day.

1:01:07.793 --> 1:01:08.919
Don't.

1:01:10.045 --> 1:01:12.256
It was an accident. That's all it was.

1:01:14.925 --> 1:01:16.385
It was just an accident.

1:01:24.476 --> 1:01:26.728
I just want our family back.

1:01:32.901 --> 1:01:33.902
So do I.

1:01:42.202 --> 1:01:43.287
Try to get some rest.
