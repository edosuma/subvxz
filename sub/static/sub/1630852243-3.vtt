WEBVTT

00:07.842 --> 00:08.843
Will I fall?

00:08.926 --> 00:10.553
You will not fall. Trust me.

00:10.678 --> 00:11.846
-Okay?
-Okay.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.597
Wait. Careful!

00:15.349 --> 00:16.267
Silly!

00:17.727 --> 00:19.353
Let's go, we're close.

00:19.437 --> 00:20.354
FIVE YEARS AGO

00:20.438 --> 00:22.690
-Is there any living animal?
-No.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.568
And...

00:26.902 --> 00:27.945
And...

00:31.657 --> 00:34.577
At last, they've recognized your talent.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.328
That's so beautiful, Caco!

00:36.412 --> 00:38.122
You're the best seller they have.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.625
You're the best husband.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.211
I wanna taste it.

00:44.962 --> 00:45.880
First, a toast

00:46.589 --> 00:48.090
to this amazing dinner.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.175
To you.

00:56.640 --> 00:57.767
May I?

01:06.525 --> 01:07.359
Caco,

01:07.777 --> 01:09.945
these are the best ribs I've ever eaten.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.781
-Stop it.
-I'm serious.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.908
You could work with that.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.868
You could be a chef.

01:16.702 --> 01:18.078
You'd be very successful.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.123
You know what else was successful?

01:21.499 --> 01:23.667
I love candlelight.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.003
-Really?
-Come here.

01:45.064 --> 01:46.941
Two months behind, isn't it, Caco?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.234
Look,

01:48.317 --> 01:52.363
I honestly hope the mortgage is up to date
with the bank.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.073
Sure, that's why

01:54.156 --> 01:55.950
I'm spending all of my savings.

01:56.659 --> 01:58.244
I waited to pay electricity.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.662
That's why our marriage ended.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.330
Because you waited.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.834
This goddamn habit of yours
to keep waiting.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.461
What are we gonna do, then?

02:08.254 --> 02:09.088
We?

02:10.422 --> 02:11.590
I've taken care of it.

02:12.049 --> 02:13.008
Like I always do.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.677
I found a way.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.888
I spent the day walking under the sun,

02:18.472 --> 02:20.307
looking to sell my wedding ring.

02:31.986 --> 02:32.945
Here.

02:33.696 --> 02:34.572
My half of it.

02:40.786 --> 02:42.454
<i>Hi, sweetie, how are you?</i>

02:42.705 --> 02:43.622
Hi, Mom.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.166
<i>You're showing Caco, not yourself.</i>

02:46.333 --> 02:47.668
<i>-Hi, Caco.</i>
-Hi, Mrs. Anita.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.837
<i>Guys, can you hear me?</i>

02:50.129 --> 02:52.047
Mom, is it urgent?

02:52.256 --> 02:53.465
<i>Turn the lights on!</i>

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
There's a blackout in Barra, Mom.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.386
Mom, is it urgent?

02:57.469 --> 02:58.971
<i>-Extremely.</i>
-Let it out.

02:59.054 --> 03:04.101
<i>My friends from dance class invited me</i>
<i>on a wonderful trip to Poços de Caldas!</i>

03:04.226 --> 03:06.478
If it's an invitation, that's great, then.

03:06.562 --> 03:11.358
<i>Kind of, Camila. When your daughter lives</i>
<i>in Barra, nobody invites you.</i>

03:11.942 --> 03:13.611
Mom, I got it.

03:13.903 --> 03:16.196
But this time, I won't be able to pay.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.283
I have so many problems.
I don't know if I can help you.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.993
<i>Don't worry, baby.</i>

03:21.076 --> 03:22.995
<i>Mommy will work it out as usual.</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:25.748
<i>I'll get a loan from the bank, it's fine.</i>

03:25.831 --> 03:26.665
Excuse me?

03:27.166 --> 03:29.543
<i>Why would you move to Barra?</i>

03:29.627 --> 03:31.962
<i>Things here in Tijuca are so much cheaper.</i>

03:32.046 --> 03:34.548
Fine, Mom. Kisses. Talk to you later.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.466
<i>Fine.</i>

03:42.723 --> 03:44.642
Caco, come on, bro.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.394
You're all wired up because of Bugs Bunny?

03:47.519 --> 03:49.897
At this point, do you know what you need?

03:49.980 --> 03:50.940
Make some money.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.066
I have an idea.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.525
I just need someone.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.860
Bro, I'm screwed.

03:54.944 --> 03:56.362
Listen to this.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.821
You know when a girl

03:58.364 --> 04:00.115
wants to take revenge on her ex?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.911
-Yes.
-So, she goes to a party.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.955
She knows he'll be there.

04:06.622 --> 04:08.165
What will she rub in his face?

04:08.374 --> 04:09.708
-What?
-Myself.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.752
-Excuse me?
-Me, Caco.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.420
Rental boyfriend, man.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.881
She'll get to the party with me,

04:15.965 --> 04:20.010
I have charisma, a killer smile.
I know how to grab, how to dance...

04:20.302 --> 04:22.137
The guy will see me and go nuts.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.180
Man, don't even...

04:23.263 --> 04:25.099
Marcinho, let me say something.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.267
Don't ever tell anyone this idea.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.937
Maybe Camila is right about you.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.732
Not even darkness can stop Bugs Bunny.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.275
It's tough.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.987
Hold on!

04:38.112 --> 04:42.282
I have another idea for making money
from home.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.077
Marcinho, look at myself,
at this situation.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.954
I don't have money for that.

04:47.538 --> 04:48.706
Relax.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.958
I bring the initial investment.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.251
You bring the balcony.

04:53.210 --> 04:54.253
Look!

04:54.545 --> 04:55.713
Look at this, Caco!

04:56.213 --> 04:59.717
Look, I've got goosebumps.
My God. That's him.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.720
God's telling us
our project will work out.

05:03.012 --> 05:03.846
You think so?

05:03.971 --> 05:04.930
I'm telling you.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.641
No, don't do that.

05:08.058 --> 05:08.892
Leave it.

05:09.435 --> 05:10.436
That's for him.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.606
Did you get it?

05:14.690 --> 05:15.983
-You brought it?
-Hold on.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.818
What's this? Let's fix it first.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.862
You try getting ready in the dark.

05:20.279 --> 05:21.113
There you go.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.031
Where is it?

05:22.114 --> 05:24.324
Straighten out your top in the bathroom.

05:25.200 --> 05:25.993
Come on!

05:29.329 --> 05:30.247
Where is it?

05:30.414 --> 05:31.665
-Easy!
-Where is it?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.751
Here it is.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.295
It's all here.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.880
Are they charged?

05:38.005 --> 05:38.839
I'm so relieved!

05:38.922 --> 05:40.549
What an abstinence crisis!

05:41.216 --> 05:42.926
That's what a cell phone can do.

05:43.052 --> 05:43.886
Sure.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.180
When is the power back?

05:46.263 --> 05:48.766
Any minute now,
but better safe than sorry.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.895
Pout your pretty lips
and look to your side.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.229
Girl,

05:55.022 --> 05:56.148
I live with my ex,

05:56.356 --> 05:59.068
my power got cut off,
I may lose my only property,

05:59.151 --> 06:00.402
and you want me to flirt?

06:00.486 --> 06:01.653
Where is he?

06:01.737 --> 06:02.780
At three o'clock.

06:03.405 --> 06:04.323
To the right.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.908
There.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.123
I can't face that.

06:13.624 --> 06:17.211
That's why you're sexually frustrated
and uptight.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.089
That's why you can't do anything.
Free Consuelo!

06:20.964 --> 06:22.007
Dry martini, please.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.344
I'm trying, but look at this.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.180
This app only sends me junk. Look.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.765
-Oh, my!
-Look!

06:29.890 --> 06:31.183
-Jeez.
-See?

06:31.266 --> 06:34.228
No. You're swiping the wrong way,
it's this way.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.145
-But...
-Let me.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.940
-What are you doing?
-Let me do this.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.525
-No!
-This one's great.

06:39.691 --> 06:40.943
It's a date.

06:41.610 --> 06:44.363
I've set your first date with a crush.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.490
João Paulo.

07:27.781 --> 07:28.740
Guys,

07:29.241 --> 07:31.952
what's this barbecue smell
early in the morning?

07:32.077 --> 07:34.413
Ribs. It takes forever to get it right.

07:34.788 --> 07:37.583
-Yeah, right.
-Come on, I'm working!

07:37.958 --> 07:39.084
We decided to launch

07:39.168 --> 07:42.754
MC Grill, a barbecue delivery
to pay off the apartment's debts.

07:42.921 --> 07:43.839
I see.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.550
MC Grill operates on my balcony, then.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.845
-Our balcony.
-It was my idea to save money.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.138
Whose money is that?

07:51.430 --> 07:52.264
-His.
-Mine.

07:52.723 --> 07:57.352
By the way, I'm the investor,
please have my card.

07:57.603 --> 07:58.645
If you ever need

07:58.812 --> 08:00.772
catering with a discount,

08:00.856 --> 08:02.399
for your meetings.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.276
Count on me. You know why?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.486
You won't have to pay for delivery.

08:06.570 --> 08:07.779
Say again, Marcinho?

08:07.863 --> 08:10.574
She won't have to pay for delivery.

08:11.116 --> 08:14.912
You'd better correct that,
because "delivery" has a "Y".

08:16.038 --> 08:16.872
Okay.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.250
Yeah, the guy...

08:24.588 --> 08:25.881
-Hi, Ana.
-Hi, darling.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.216
-How are you?
-Fine.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.640
Tell me, you're having
barbecue for breakfast now?

08:34.723 --> 08:35.724
No, of course not.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.976
<i>Zumba class at Room 8.</i>

08:38.143 --> 08:41.647
Then why is there such
a strong barbecue smell at this time?

08:42.231 --> 08:43.482
Oh, it's ribs.

08:43.565 --> 08:46.693
We're making it for lunch.
Takes forever to get right.

08:47.486 --> 08:49.446
By the way, this Thursday's game...

08:49.529 --> 08:51.323
Don't worry. I can't make it.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.166
It's better.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.543
You thought I was tall.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.337
Then when we meet...

09:05.420 --> 09:07.089
But I think you're very tall.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.548
Is that good?

09:08.924 --> 09:10.217
It is!

09:11.426 --> 09:14.304
So, I was the chosen one
to take your virginity?

09:15.138 --> 09:16.265
From the app.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.604
Quite a responsibility.

09:23.647 --> 09:25.274
I hope to not let you down.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.403
Wanna come to Búzios with me?

09:29.569 --> 09:30.404
Excuse me?

09:30.529 --> 09:33.240
You'll meet my mom, my sister.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.243
Oh, I love Búzios.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.412
You'll love my sister, Viviane.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.540
She's a huge promoter,
always hosting events.

09:41.665 --> 09:42.499
Really?

09:43.000 --> 09:46.253
I have an event today
at the condo, it's huge.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.046
-Would she be down for it?
-Sure.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.173
She loves beauty stuff.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.467
Perfect!

09:52.634 --> 09:53.468
Perfect.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.348
Man, crack it open, please. Thanks.

10:01.852 --> 10:02.686
Hot, isn't it?

10:03.103 --> 10:03.937
Very.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.314
Do you like it hot?

10:10.193 --> 10:11.111
Tell me something.

10:11.903 --> 10:13.030
Do you like volleyball?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.328
I'm always near Station Six.

10:20.162 --> 10:21.455
In need of moral support.

10:23.165 --> 10:23.999
Deal.

10:26.626 --> 10:27.669
Tell me something.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.629
Be honest.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.089
Okay.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.300
How was your first time?

10:33.675 --> 10:34.676
Was it good for you?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.102
What a loser!

10:48.315 --> 10:49.524
-Mr. Caco.
-Yes?

10:49.649 --> 10:51.860
I wanna talk to you. I don't like gossip,

10:52.194 --> 10:55.489
but the neighbors are complaining
about the barbecue smell.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.867
My goodness,
I've never seen a condo like this.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.619
It looks like a resort!

11:00.702 --> 11:03.372
Camila, the condo fees must be a fortune!

11:03.497 --> 11:06.500
But as Helen, our president, says,

11:06.583 --> 11:08.502
"Things aren't expensive,

11:08.585 --> 11:10.212
"we need to make more money!"

11:14.299 --> 11:15.926
<i>Access denied.</i>

11:16.676 --> 11:17.677
Put some spit.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.805
<i>-Access denied.</i>
-Alcohol gel?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.933
Even paradise isn't perfect.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.184
Let me try here.

11:25.102 --> 11:28.313
What if someone left the key
at the reception?

11:28.397 --> 11:32.067
We don't do keys here,
it's all about biometrics.

11:32.275 --> 11:33.151
So chic!

11:33.235 --> 11:36.446
God forbid, what if this technology's
on the blink?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.073
You can't even get home.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.199
Hello!

11:42.536 --> 11:43.870
That's all I needed.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.873
Mr. Jorge?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.000
Come on.

11:51.503 --> 11:52.671
What an easy life, huh?

11:52.754 --> 11:53.755
Look, the girls!

11:53.964 --> 11:55.674
I'm so glad they came!

11:57.467 --> 11:58.301
Viviane?

11:58.468 --> 12:01.513
You really are everything
your brother said you were.

12:01.596 --> 12:02.514
Nonsense.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.808
-Nice to meet you!
-Nice to meet you!

12:06.393 --> 12:08.353
There was no one at the reception,

12:08.437 --> 12:10.689
but your condo manager let me in.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.190
Guilherme? Where is he?

12:12.274 --> 12:14.151
I think he was off to the beach.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.485
Of course, the beach.

12:15.694 --> 12:19.197
-I'm sorry, is it a bad time?
-Of course not, you're on time.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.366
Biometrics isn't working,

12:21.450 --> 12:23.118
so we can't use the party room.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.996
But it's not a problem,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.831
my apartment is cozier.

12:28.081 --> 12:28.957
Let's go, girls?

12:29.249 --> 12:30.167
Please.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.342
Mr. Caco,

12:40.051 --> 12:41.344
I can only say this.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.848
Those neighbors are

12:45.223 --> 12:47.100
a bunch of jealous folks.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.561
-Some farofa?
-Please.

12:55.066 --> 12:58.361
Please, girls, come in.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.238
Make yourselves at home.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.781
Come on in.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.535
You're at home.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.831
Take a seat. I'll put the boxes here.

13:10.582 --> 13:13.084
Viviane, please.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.295
Excuse me.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.881
Sit comfortably on this vintage couch.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.341
It's a new trend.

13:19.925 --> 13:23.470
I'm going to check on something
and I'll be right back.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.267
Thank you, Mr. Caco.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.727
If you need anything...

13:30.852 --> 13:32.354
Mr. Marcinho, thank you.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.397
I must go to the reception.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.024
Mrs. Camila, let me give you

13:36.316 --> 13:37.442
my congratulations.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.819
I've never had such amazing ribs.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.072
Good luck with your business, it will...

13:42.155 --> 13:45.867
Mr. Jorge,
a building really needs a doorman.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.203
-Sure, Mrs. Camila.
-Thank you.

13:52.582 --> 13:53.708
One minute.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.674
What's that thing in the living room?

14:00.757 --> 14:04.010
Don't worry, I paid for it. It's a gift.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.930
I'm in a business meeting.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.598
If you disturb me,

14:08.682 --> 14:10.725
you know where I'll put those sticks.

14:10.976 --> 14:12.102
Resentful, huh?

14:18.316 --> 14:22.445
My New Fabulous will change your life,
financial independence...

14:22.737 --> 14:26.116
I've just become a businessman
and I was called Mr. Marcio.

14:26.199 --> 14:29.119
That's a stretch, Marcinho. Take it easy.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.871
It's only fair,
I attended a year of law school.

14:31.997 --> 14:35.083
Fix it for me. Thanks.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.295
Girls, I see Denise's got
highlights in her hair.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.464
-You noticed!
-Yes, you used My New Lightning.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.841
-Of course!
-Right?

14:43.550 --> 14:46.803
I'm so glad you came, Vivi.
Can I call you Vivi?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.179
-I'd rather not.
-Okay.

14:48.263 --> 14:49.472
It doesn't suit you.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.557
I like Viviane best.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.975
Vivi's a short name.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.768
-You're a tall woman.
-Yes.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.188
João Paulo talked so much about you,
it's like we're besties.

14:57.272 --> 14:59.983
João Paulo is so cute.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.654
I'll introduce you
to the My New Fabulous world.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.074
Good afternoon!

15:08.158 --> 15:12.912
I'd like for you to try our delicious
gourmet ribs, Barra da Tijuca's finest.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.373
-I'd like some.
-Me, too.

15:15.457 --> 15:18.001
Help yourselves.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.670
-So delicious!
-Courtesy of MC Grill.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.464
Thanks, but I had lunch.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.715
Would you like more?

15:23.798 --> 15:25.592
-Of course!
-Excuse me.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.594
Some more?

15:27.677 --> 15:29.804
-I'd like some.
-Here's our card,

15:29.888 --> 15:31.389
made with much love.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.309
If you wanna talk about love...

15:34.434 --> 15:36.311
-Some more?
-Do you have a card?

15:38.063 --> 15:38.897
A card?

15:38.980 --> 15:41.941
This one's Carlos Augusto, my ex-husband.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.902
Something in your teeth.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.654
It's still there.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.490
I'm sorry. Call me Caco.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.033
Only my partner has a card.

15:50.116 --> 15:54.704
Who'd like to taste
the barbecue sauce version?

15:54.788 --> 15:55.622
-Me!
-Me, too!

15:55.705 --> 15:57.374
To the balcony, follow me.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.625
But I have one.

15:59.167 --> 16:02.879
Here's my card, we could maybe do
some business together.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.382
Someday. Who knows?

16:05.840 --> 16:06.675
Of course.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.427
I have something
we can do together. Today.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.430
Let me show you the collection.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.724
Of course. After the barbecue sauce.

16:15.058 --> 16:15.892
Of course.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.310
On the balcony?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.105
On the balcony.

16:36.996 --> 16:43.002
JOÃO PAULO
Roginho is dying to meet you.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.423
CAMILA
Who's Roginho?

17:00.520 --> 17:05.483
It's your turn now.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.754
Can you turn the flash on?

17:25.879 --> 17:28.757
This barbecue thing will give me
pulmonary poisoning.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.426
If I wait for compensation, you complain.

17:31.509 --> 17:35.013
If I do something,
you also complain. It's hard, Camila!

17:36.181 --> 17:37.682
Jandira!

17:38.057 --> 17:40.852
Mrs. Camila, I've missed you so!

17:40.977 --> 17:42.187
I'm so glad you're back.

17:42.270 --> 17:44.439
-I'm not back.
-You're not?

17:44.522 --> 17:46.232
I'm Caco and Mr. Marcio's partner.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.860
I hope they're paying you, then.

17:48.943 --> 17:49.944
No, Mrs. Camila.

17:50.028 --> 17:51.571
I'm a start-up now.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.823
I'll have a share in the profits.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.993
You never wanted to join My New Fabulous.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.703
You know, Camila,

17:58.787 --> 18:00.455
when you have to buy something

18:00.747 --> 18:01.873
to sell it afterwards,

18:02.373 --> 18:05.960
and make people come to your place,
serve them food,

18:06.085 --> 18:09.422
and convince them into buying something
to sell it after...

18:10.006 --> 18:12.634
That's not my business profile, you see?

18:13.009 --> 18:13.968
Excuse me, Camila.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.553
Mr. Caco.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.597
Let's wrap this sauce?

18:17.722 --> 18:19.557
-A bit more, right? Okay.
-Yes.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.893
<i>Hi, babe, how are you?</i>

18:21.976 --> 18:25.730
<i>I'm sending you this video</i>
<i>to tell you my sister loved you.</i>

18:25.814 --> 18:27.315
<i>I finally found you.</i>

18:27.398 --> 18:29.651
<i>Many kisses.</i>

18:31.569 --> 18:35.448
-Mom, you won't believe it.
<i>-You're back with Caco?</i>

18:35.532 --> 18:36.825
<i>Access denied.</i>

18:36.908 --> 18:38.284
Guilherme, son of a bitch!

18:38.368 --> 18:40.745
<i>Sweetie, don't say that about his mom.</i>

18:40.870 --> 18:43.289
<i>But why did you call me?</i>

18:43.748 --> 18:46.084
I've got a boyfriend.

18:46.584 --> 18:47.710
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

18:47.794 --> 18:49.671
<i>Take him to dancing classes.</i>

18:49.754 --> 18:52.173
<i>-Access denied.</i>
-I can't believe it.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.801
It's like a curse, nothing works.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.637
I'm struggling
with my My New Fabulous sales.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.014
I'm actually risking losing my car.

19:00.640 --> 19:04.435
<i>Don't even say that!</i>

19:04.519 --> 19:07.522
Mom, you'd better light a fire
for Saint John.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.107
<i>Access denied.</i>

19:10.567 --> 19:13.403
To the right.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.529
The door!

19:15.780 --> 19:18.366
To the left.

19:19.075 --> 19:22.620
<i>One, two, three! Up.</i>

19:27.876 --> 19:28.877
Easy!

19:29.878 --> 19:31.671
-Hi.
-What's with the nonsense?

19:31.754 --> 19:33.548
Easy, for the love of God!

19:33.631 --> 19:36.092
After all those years,
what a disappointment.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.928
Listen, Camila, I'll be straight.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.680
Sometimes,

19:40.805 --> 19:43.725
to play cards,
you must avoid the discard pile.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.852
There's a lot more to it

19:46.144 --> 19:47.854
than meets the eye, you see?

19:48.521 --> 19:52.859
Okay, I didn't get it, but I'm not the one
you owe an explanation.

19:52.942 --> 19:53.860
Explain what?

19:53.943 --> 19:55.987
Explain why this rubbish biometrics

19:56.070 --> 19:58.489
doesn't work
when we pay a fortune to the HOA.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.867
-Do you?
-You know what I mean.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.745
Actually, biometrics isn't working

20:03.828 --> 20:06.581
for residents whose condo fees are late.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.707
It's personal, then.

20:07.790 --> 20:08.708
Definitely.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.711
The association is more and more strict.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.212
Easy, Ana.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.258
There must be a way to activate
her biometrics, right?

20:19.802 --> 20:21.054
Of course there is.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.555
Just pay your condo fees.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.558
Excuse me.

20:33.650 --> 20:34.567
Let me handle it.

20:43.618 --> 20:46.371
Mr. Marcio,
we'll take this out of your share.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.081
Where's the ice?

20:49.082 --> 20:52.043
-What ice?
-Marcio, you had to put the meat on ice.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.545
Wait, no one said anything about that.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.090
Let me show you the text Caco sent me.

20:57.507 --> 21:01.761
"Don't forget to put the meat
inside the cooler."

21:02.136 --> 21:03.680
Are you serious, Marcinho?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.223
How long was the meat here?

21:05.431 --> 21:09.143
It's here, chilling,
protected from the sun. What's wrong?

21:12.897 --> 21:14.357
Bunch of amateurs.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.985
Learn from the expert.

21:39.882 --> 21:40.758
João Paulo!

21:48.933 --> 21:49.934
What is this?

21:50.018 --> 21:51.602
What's up, babe?

21:52.228 --> 21:53.312
"What's up?"

21:53.688 --> 21:55.273
You were just kissing her.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.444
-Oh, Lídia?
-Lídia!

21:59.527 --> 22:02.405
Don't worry, she's so nice.
You'll love her.

22:04.073 --> 22:06.117
Is this a joke or do you have amnesia?

22:06.743 --> 22:07.577
What?

22:10.038 --> 22:10.955
Wait a minute.

22:11.330 --> 22:15.418
You thought you were the only one
I was seeing from the app?

22:16.919 --> 22:17.754
No!

22:19.130 --> 22:20.006
Of course not!

22:20.757 --> 22:22.091
You're seeing other guys?

22:22.592 --> 22:23.551
Many guys!

22:24.343 --> 22:26.971
I'm packed with guys.

22:27.972 --> 22:30.475
Actually, Guto's here.

22:31.059 --> 22:32.226
Let me...

22:34.771 --> 22:37.523
Close it! Guilherme, hurry up!

22:42.570 --> 22:45.740
My bad, I didn't see you coming.

22:50.036 --> 22:50.870
Camila,

22:51.079 --> 22:53.206
I'd like for you to know I'm fighting

22:53.289 --> 22:57.210
all the way to make them put you back
in the biometrics system.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.879
But, darling, you know our neighbors.

23:00.338 --> 23:03.633
They think you're loaded with cash,
having daily barbecues.

23:03.716 --> 23:08.596
<i>...humidity at 99% and no chance of rain.</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:11.891
Oh, today won't be possible.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.811
Let's try to play again next Thursday.

23:16.479 --> 23:18.314
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

23:18.481 --> 23:21.150
-Beatriz.
-Ana, darling. How are you?

23:21.526 --> 23:25.029
Be ready for tonight.
My horoscope says I'm gonna ace the game.

23:32.954 --> 23:34.580
You know what?

23:34.831 --> 23:35.873
Go fuck yourselves!

23:37.208 --> 23:39.794
Camila, it's the wrong floor.

23:54.642 --> 23:57.061
<i>If you need anything, just call me.</i>

23:57.145 --> 23:59.814
I'm like a genie,
I'll make your wish come true.

23:59.897 --> 24:00.731
Great.

24:01.065 --> 24:06.529
I've got many wishes
to be fulfilled, Caco.

24:15.788 --> 24:16.873
Viviane.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.749
What a fancy party, girl!

24:19.417 --> 24:21.502
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.254
-Carol.
-Denise.

24:23.337 --> 24:24.714
We work with Camila.

24:25.173 --> 24:26.674
Of course, I remember now.

24:26.757 --> 24:28.050
Camila's not here yet?

24:28.176 --> 24:31.762
What a shame, I forgot to invite her.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.099
Excuse me. I have to work.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.186
Look at that.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.771
This golden lion tamarin can't fool me.

24:40.897 --> 24:43.065
-I'm texting Camila right now.
-Do it.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.526
"Camila,

24:45.735 --> 24:48.321
"we miss you

24:48.487 --> 24:50.031
"at the barbecue."

24:50.156 --> 24:51.866
Sad emoji and heart.

24:52.074 --> 24:52.950
Great.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.121
Marcinho, can you take over?
Everything's set up.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.707
Where are you going?

25:01.125 --> 25:03.085
Viviane called me to play a game.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.795
Already?

25:06.297 --> 25:07.423
Look at Viviane.

25:09.550 --> 25:10.384
Would you wait?

25:23.814 --> 25:25.316
Stop it, Conga.

25:25.524 --> 25:26.359
Come out.

25:27.235 --> 25:28.402
Never again.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.950
The only thing this crappy app did
was find Caco

25:34.283 --> 25:35.284
a girlfriend.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.955
He's right, though.

25:39.455 --> 25:40.748
Life goes on.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.505
Conga, you'll let yourself down
for a roaching?

25:49.173 --> 25:50.299
For a what?

25:51.300 --> 25:52.385
A roaching.

25:53.302 --> 25:54.512
It's when a guy

25:54.637 --> 25:57.807
pretends he loves you,
when he's actually dating around.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.602
It's so normal there's even a name for it.

26:01.686 --> 26:04.230
There's no such thing as normal anymore.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.234
But if things don't work out with someone,
look for another.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.613
I won't feel wretched because of a guy

26:12.822 --> 26:14.532
who laughs like a pig.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.159
Conga,

26:17.576 --> 26:19.245
you've got so many problems.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.290
You have your divorce,

26:23.249 --> 26:25.459
you risk losing your only property,

26:25.960 --> 26:27.211
your power was cut off,

26:27.586 --> 26:29.714
your sales are hitting rock bottom,

26:30.256 --> 26:32.049
your bank account's in the red...

26:33.801 --> 26:36.637
And you worry about Mr. Piggy?

26:39.140 --> 26:41.600
Thanks for reminding me I'm in deep shit.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.812
I feel a lot better now.

26:58.034 --> 27:00.536
We're not too exposed here?

27:00.703 --> 27:02.580
Exposed? Relax, babe.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.081
Won't you take it off?

27:04.373 --> 27:06.042
Take your heels off.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.753
Where's the toilet?

27:09.253 --> 27:10.254
I don't know.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.422
Out there I guess.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.549
I'll be back.

27:14.008 --> 27:15.718
-Don't be long.
-I won't.

27:16.594 --> 27:17.470
I'll be waiting.

27:17.595 --> 27:20.306
<i>Caco, pick up, for the love of God!</i>

27:20.723 --> 27:23.601
Caco, pick up, damn it!
For the love of God!

27:24.352 --> 27:25.686
Oh, my God!

27:25.770 --> 27:28.856
I haven't felt this way
since grandpa Moacir's birthday.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.900
The poor man died that day.

27:31.776 --> 27:33.527
Why would you say that?

27:34.570 --> 27:35.946
Everything's locked!

27:55.424 --> 27:56.717
I'm going there.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.135
I'm going there.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.970
No! Stay there!

28:00.054 --> 28:01.889
Watch it!

28:05.393 --> 28:07.770
Naughty boy!

28:10.064 --> 28:13.150
You're dancing for me,

28:13.275 --> 28:14.568
I like it.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.323
Gorgeous!

28:22.243 --> 28:23.911
You're taking too long, Caco!

28:24.036 --> 28:26.205
Easy!

28:28.332 --> 28:30.376
No!

28:38.634 --> 28:41.720
Coconut water? I also need some.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.809
What's with the defeated look?

28:47.685 --> 28:48.894
Where is your joy?

28:50.312 --> 28:52.231
MC Grill became a shit show.

28:52.481 --> 28:53.899
Literally.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.193
The meat went bad.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.070
Someone forgot to put it on ice.

28:58.279 --> 29:01.615
Someone forgot to ask clearly
to put it on ice.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.119
We're famous, at least.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.621
"The Runs in Barra" is trending.

29:08.205 --> 29:10.833
I won't stay in this company for nothing.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.169
God forbid going through that again.

29:13.544 --> 29:14.545
Chill, Jandira.

29:14.628 --> 29:15.504
I'm chill.

29:15.713 --> 29:16.547
Very chill.

29:17.006 --> 29:20.009
I can't be stressed or my body screams.

29:20.092 --> 29:20.968
Tell me about it.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.054
Also,

29:24.889 --> 29:26.807
there's something bugging me.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.101
If I was a partner,

29:29.560 --> 29:31.854
why is the company called MC Grill

29:31.979 --> 29:33.898
instead of MCJ Grill?

29:34.857 --> 29:36.108
That's why it failed.

29:36.484 --> 29:37.318
Wrong start.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.279
Resentful, huh?

29:40.654 --> 29:41.655
Not at all.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.241
I don't take it personally.

29:44.575 --> 29:46.285
I'm leaving.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.412
Life goes on.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.545
Camila, write it down, I failed again.

29:58.964 --> 30:02.927
The good news is
that rock bottom is the limit.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.678
You can only go up.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.892
Got to stay positive, right?

30:16.565 --> 30:17.399
Good morning.

30:17.608 --> 30:18.817
Process server.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.946
Speaking like that, it has to be serious.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.407
The condo's suing us.

30:26.116 --> 30:28.285
Our debts must be paid this month

30:28.369 --> 30:29.620
or we lose the flat.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.580
I should've finished law school.
