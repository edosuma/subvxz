WEBVTT

00:01.450 --> 00:02.855
You guys ready for
the farewell show?

00:02.885 --> 00:05.085
Yes, sirree! And we're
gonna go out on top!

00:05.153 --> 00:07.455
We're gonna go out on top
and we're gonna segue

00:07.523 --> 00:09.027
to new beginnings
and brighter tomorrows!

00:09.057 --> 00:10.257
That's the spirit, Al.

00:10.326 --> 00:12.626
All right! Oh,
I'm a total wreck.

00:12.693 --> 00:14.428
I can't believe this
is going to be over.

00:14.496 --> 00:16.364
Oh, I know.
Me either.

00:16.431 --> 00:19.500
This is the last time I'm
gonna introduce you guys.

00:19.568 --> 00:22.270
The last time I'm
gonna give you CPR.

00:23.739 --> 00:26.474
Oh, gosh! I'm gonna
miss all this!

00:26.541 --> 00:30.411
I'm even gonna
miss your putdowns.

00:30.479 --> 00:35.549
Just because the show's over doesn't
mean the putdowns have to stop.

00:35.617 --> 00:38.519
I can insult you
long-distance.

00:38.587 --> 00:40.922
What do you mean,
long-distance?

00:40.990 --> 00:43.959
Jill got a job at a family
practice in Bloomington.

00:44.026 --> 00:45.993
Looks like we're
moving to Indiana.

00:46.061 --> 00:47.061
Indiana?

00:47.229 --> 00:48.596
Our lives are changing so fast!

00:48.664 --> 00:52.233
- Oh, stop the roller coaster!
- Oh.

00:52.301 --> 00:53.334
Al... Al...

00:53.402 --> 00:54.469
You know what, Tim?

00:54.536 --> 00:56.504
I knew we had to
say good-bye to <i>Tool Time,</i>

00:56.572 --> 00:58.973
I didn't realize we'd have
to say good-bye to you.

00:59.041 --> 01:03.011
You know, but change can be a good thing.
Al's getting married.

01:03.079 --> 01:05.080
- Well, that's true.
- Yeah!

01:05.147 --> 01:07.415
- Yeah!
- All right.

01:07.482 --> 01:09.150
And you know what?
I'm pregnant.

01:09.952 --> 01:11.285
She's pregnant.

01:13.556 --> 01:15.790
This is it!
Today's the big day!

01:17.893 --> 01:19.561
Talk about a hot show!

01:19.628 --> 01:21.863
I got about 20 fire
marshals standing by

01:21.931 --> 01:24.699
for when you "accidentally"
burn down the set.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.447
Do you really want us
to burn down the set?

01:26.502 --> 01:28.536
How do you sleep at night,
young man?

01:28.604 --> 01:31.939
Trust me, gang,
the show's gonna be huge.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.141
But since I'm a VP
I get to watch it

01:34.209 --> 01:38.245
at Binford HQ with the COO,
the CFO and the CEO.

01:38.313 --> 01:41.682
Which one would be the SOB?

01:41.750 --> 01:45.186
Oh, I get it. You're doing
a fun thing with letters.

01:46.789 --> 01:48.956
All right!
Break a leg, guys!

01:49.024 --> 01:52.359
You know, I think starting
electrical fires is a stupid idea!

01:52.428 --> 01:54.562
Heidi, Heidi, Heidi...
Shh. Come on, guys.

01:54.630 --> 01:56.130
This is our last <i>Tool Time.</i>

01:56.197 --> 01:57.669
Morgan Wandell's not gonna
tell us what to do.

01:57.699 --> 01:59.334
- He's not?
- No.

01:59.401 --> 02:01.602
<i>Tool Time's</i> going out
like we came in.

02:01.670 --> 02:03.104
With no audience?

02:05.507 --> 02:07.708
No. With style,
with class.

02:07.776 --> 02:12.113
No stupid fires, no fake explosions
and no staged accidents.

02:12.181 --> 02:13.314
Yeah...

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:24.093 --> 02:27.061
See, it's much better
when it's real.

03:18.781 --> 03:20.714
<i>Well, hidey ho, neighborette.</i>

03:20.782 --> 03:24.953
<i>Oh, my! I see Al and Trudy's wedding
arrangements are progressing.</i>

03:25.020 --> 03:26.387
Yeah. But
the seating arrangement,

03:26.454 --> 03:29.624
it's all messed up,
just like my life.

03:29.691 --> 03:33.093
<i>Now wait a second, Jill. I thought you
were gonna take that job in Indiana.</i>

03:33.161 --> 03:34.496
<i>Tim told me it was all set.</i>

03:34.563 --> 03:36.163
Yeah. Well, yeah.
That's what we decided.

03:36.198 --> 03:39.433
But I haven't been able
to make the phone call.

03:39.501 --> 03:42.403
It's a great opportunity.
The whole family's being real supportive.

03:42.470 --> 03:45.740
You know, I just don't know
what's holding me back.

03:45.808 --> 03:48.810
<i>Well, Jill, this has been
your home for 20 years.</i>

03:48.877 --> 03:51.546
<i>You'd have to leave
your whole life behind.</i>

03:51.613 --> 03:54.882
<i>You'd have to say good-bye
to all your old friends.</i>

03:54.949 --> 03:57.318
<i>We'd have to say
good-bye to you.</i>

03:57.386 --> 03:58.786
So you're telling me to stay.

03:58.854 --> 04:00.020
<i>No, no, no, no, no...</i>

04:00.122 --> 04:01.322
You're telling me to go.

04:01.390 --> 04:03.457
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

04:03.525 --> 04:06.094
Hello, not helping!

04:06.162 --> 04:08.496
<i>Jill, this move is
a very difficult decision.</i>

04:08.564 --> 04:11.098
<i>I can't be the one to make it.</i>

04:12.868 --> 04:15.803
When I was a little girl
we moved all the time.

04:15.871 --> 04:17.738
My mom never questioned it.
She'd just say,

04:17.805 --> 04:19.277
"Whatever's good for your
father is good for all of us."

04:19.307 --> 04:21.274
And we'd pack our bags
and follow him.

04:21.343 --> 04:24.579
<i>So, basically, for 20 years
you've been following Tim.</i>

04:24.647 --> 04:27.314
Yeah. Right to
the emergency room.

04:27.382 --> 04:29.150
Now, see,
that was the beauty of it.

04:29.217 --> 04:32.419
I married Tim, we moved
into this wonderful house,

04:32.487 --> 04:35.223
and I got to put down roots
for the first time in my life.

04:35.290 --> 04:39.861
And I've really cherished that.

04:39.928 --> 04:42.831
<i>Yes. But on the other hand,
Tim is making a huge change.</i>

04:42.898 --> 04:45.667
<i>He's willing to base
his life around you.</i>

04:45.734 --> 04:47.902
<i>I really think
that's worth considering.</i>

04:47.970 --> 04:50.038
What if we go to Indiana
and it all falls apart?

04:50.105 --> 04:53.107
<i>Well, what if it doesn't
and you're a huge success?</i>

04:53.175 --> 04:56.477
So, I should go, shouldn't I?

04:56.578 --> 04:59.013
<i>Jill, there is no limit
to what you can accomplish.</i>

04:59.080 --> 05:00.781
<i>But if you want me to stand here</i>

05:00.849 --> 05:02.783
<i>and sell my best friends
on leaving,</i>

05:02.851 --> 05:05.519
<i>I really cannot do that.</i>

05:05.587 --> 05:09.490
Wilson, I'm really
gonna miss you.

05:09.558 --> 05:10.858
<i>So I take it you are going?</i>

05:10.925 --> 05:12.165
Unless you think I should stay.

05:12.227 --> 05:13.761
<i>Jill!</i>

05:13.828 --> 05:15.563
I'll make the call.

05:17.098 --> 05:18.778
Thank you, everybody.
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

05:18.833 --> 05:21.769
I am, and for the last time,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

05:21.836 --> 05:23.074
And of course you all know
my assistant,

05:23.104 --> 05:26.307
"Al be doing infomercials
for a living" Borland.

05:29.878 --> 05:32.346
It should be a nice show.
It's our last show.

05:32.414 --> 05:35.249
Of course, we all hope to be on
to bigger and better things.

05:35.317 --> 05:40.488
As a matter of fact, Al here's
getting married this weekend.

05:40.555 --> 05:43.157
We have a great
last show for you today.

05:48.330 --> 05:53.300
Binford wants us to intentionally
overload a household outlet like this.

05:53.368 --> 05:56.170
Thereby starting a fire and
burning the entire set down.

05:56.238 --> 05:58.806
Instead, I'm gonna show you
the right way to do this.

05:58.874 --> 06:02.844
Folks, just get
a surge protector. Duh.

06:02.911 --> 06:04.546
End of segment.

06:04.613 --> 06:08.616
Good night, everybody!

06:08.684 --> 06:11.852
Oh, I know what you're thinking.
Come on! Last <i>Tool Time?</i>

06:11.920 --> 06:13.788
Just plugging in a toaster?

06:13.855 --> 06:17.091
Come on! Aren't you gonna
light anything on fire?

06:17.158 --> 06:18.197
Of course we're gonna
light something on fire.

06:18.227 --> 06:19.860
We're gonna burn
this place down, baby!

06:19.928 --> 06:22.263
With everybody that
helped us build it.

06:22.330 --> 06:24.136
These diehard fans dropped
whatever they were doing

06:24.166 --> 06:25.606
to be on this
last <i>Tool Time</i> with us.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.368
Let's have a warm
<i>Tool Time</i> welcome

06:27.436 --> 06:30.037
for America's
favorite all-tool band!

06:30.105 --> 06:31.538
The K & B Boys!

06:31.606 --> 06:33.441
Rock, Dwayne, Pete and Duke!

06:37.646 --> 06:42.283
And on handsaw,
the lovely Janine!

06:46.822 --> 06:48.026
You guys are here
to play music, right?

06:48.056 --> 06:51.092
Yes, sirree, Timmy! Pete!

06:51.159 --> 06:52.994
That would be me.

06:54.496 --> 06:58.332
One, two...
One, two, three!

07:21.856 --> 07:23.091
Go get them, Pete!

07:23.158 --> 07:25.994
Ladies and gentlemen,
on staple gun,

07:26.061 --> 07:29.296
master upholsterer,
Sparky Henderson!

07:35.270 --> 07:39.206
On shock absorber,
Eddie from Eddie's Body Shop!

07:41.977 --> 07:44.812
On plunger, plumber Felix Myman!

07:49.084 --> 07:52.453
And on horn, Mario Andretti!

08:01.563 --> 08:04.998
One, two...
One, two, three, four!

08:49.745 --> 08:51.312
Where's my can?

08:51.379 --> 08:56.116
<i>The last time I looked it was below
your back and above your knees.</i>

08:56.184 --> 08:57.422
Where am I supposed to put
the garbage?

08:57.452 --> 08:58.853
<i>Hey, give it to me.</i>

08:58.921 --> 09:00.922
<i>Jill moved all your trash
cans over to my side</i>

09:00.989 --> 09:03.724
<i>so there'd be more room
for the wedding.</i>

09:06.128 --> 09:08.100
If this fence weren't here,
we'd have so much more room,

09:08.130 --> 09:11.933
we could push the chairs
all the way to one side.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.168
<i>You know, Tim, you're right.</i>

09:14.236 --> 09:16.137
<i>We could have all the
chairs facing this way.</i>

09:16.205 --> 09:19.173
<i>Right. And I would build
the arch in your yard.</i>

09:19.241 --> 09:20.645
<i>Well, why don't we
take the fence down?</i>

09:20.675 --> 09:22.877
Well, we certainly could.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.480
Well, should we?

09:25.547 --> 09:27.681
<i>We could always put it
back up after the wedding.</i>

09:27.749 --> 09:30.121
How come we've never thought about
taking this fence down before?

09:30.151 --> 09:32.219
<i>Oh, I don't know. Maybe
we didn't want to reveal</i>

09:32.287 --> 09:34.422
<i>too much of ourselves.</i>

09:37.059 --> 09:39.560
But we went ahead and
revealed everything anyway.

09:39.562 --> 09:42.630
<i>Yeah. Let's take
this sucker down.</i>

09:42.697 --> 09:44.098
I got a hammer.
I'll go get it.

09:44.166 --> 09:47.368
<i>No, no, no. I got some tools over here.
Take what you need.</i>

09:47.435 --> 09:51.004
<i>- You got a pry bar in there?
- Yeah.</i>

09:51.072 --> 09:53.040
<i>Okay. Oh, boy!</i>

09:54.643 --> 09:56.510
<i>- Oh, no.
- Hmm?</i>

09:58.180 --> 09:59.680
What's that?

10:00.949 --> 10:03.450
<i>How many times
do I have to bury you?</i>

10:07.121 --> 10:09.456
- Wait till you hear the latest news.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

10:09.524 --> 10:11.858
After the final show, Binford
was practically begging me

10:11.926 --> 10:15.563
to come back to work. They offered
me more money, executive producer.

10:15.630 --> 10:17.331
<i>So now you're thinking
about staying?</i>

10:17.432 --> 10:19.199
<i>Please, Tim,
do not toy with me like this.</i>

10:19.267 --> 10:23.103
<i>You people are wreaking havoc
on my emotions!</i>

10:23.171 --> 10:25.072
Calm down. The decision is made.
We're moving.

10:25.140 --> 10:27.875
It's just that they were dangling a
pretty big carrot in front of me.

10:27.943 --> 10:30.010
<i>Yeah, well, you gave that
carrot up for Jill.</i>

10:30.078 --> 10:33.013
<i>She must've appreciated
your generosity for that.</i>

10:33.081 --> 10:35.148
Uh, actually,
she doesn't know about this.

10:35.216 --> 10:37.585
I don't want this
to affect her decision, okay?

10:37.653 --> 10:39.253
<i>You're a good man, Tim.</i>

10:39.321 --> 10:41.756
<i>I'm gonna miss having you
as a neighbor.</i>

10:41.823 --> 10:44.858
You've been a good neighbor,
too, Wilson.

10:44.926 --> 10:46.327
An odd one.

10:50.598 --> 10:52.099
Hey.

10:52.167 --> 10:54.101
Yeah. All right.

10:58.673 --> 11:00.140
Wow!

11:00.208 --> 11:02.909
Now we can see everything.

11:02.977 --> 11:06.146
<i>Does it look any different
than you thought it would?</i>

11:06.214 --> 11:07.881
Your fly's open.

11:14.723 --> 11:17.023
Well, it looks like it's
gonna be a great wedding.

11:17.091 --> 11:19.293
- I'm really glad we're doing this for Al.
- Me, too.

11:19.361 --> 11:22.262
This white wedding arch
you made is so beautiful.

11:22.330 --> 11:23.835
You know, I was gonna
go with golden arches

11:23.865 --> 11:27.300
but I was afraid we'd have to
serve over two billion Borlands.

11:27.368 --> 11:29.269
Look, look!
Harry and Delores!

11:29.337 --> 11:31.272
Welcome back.

11:31.339 --> 11:33.774
Hey, guys. I saw Al getting
his picture taken.

11:33.842 --> 11:35.576
Looks like he's gonna
go through with this.

11:35.644 --> 11:38.712
Yeah? Well, I'm betting
it's gonna go the other way.

11:38.779 --> 11:40.614
And he's not alone.

11:43.085 --> 11:46.554
You guys are betting
on a wedding? That's sick!

11:46.621 --> 11:50.190
Put me down for 100.
I say he gets married.

11:50.258 --> 11:54.428
And I got 40 bucks says
he's wearing a flannel thong.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.564
Hey, I want some of that action.

11:57.632 --> 12:00.234
I mean, you know,
I want to bet on it.

12:01.737 --> 12:03.370
Hi.

12:03.372 --> 12:06.273
Hello. Is this delivery
for Al and Trudy?

12:06.341 --> 12:09.076
No. Delivery for
Tim and Jill.

12:09.143 --> 12:10.977
- What?
- Morgan Wandell.

12:11.045 --> 12:13.914
Binford VP of media production,
and you are even prettier

12:13.982 --> 12:15.716
than the way Tim described you.

12:15.784 --> 12:17.117
Really?

12:17.185 --> 12:18.251
How did he describe me?

12:18.319 --> 12:20.054
Okay, he didn't.

12:20.121 --> 12:22.022
Look, I need to see Tim.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.795
I've been trying to convince
him to stay with <i>Tool Time.</i>

12:23.825 --> 12:25.458
He keeps turning me down.

12:25.526 --> 12:27.327
He hated what you did
to his show.

12:27.395 --> 12:29.730
No. That's all changed
since the last episode.

12:29.798 --> 12:31.932
We offered to make him
the executive producer

12:32.000 --> 12:34.101
and we offered to
give him a big raise.

12:34.169 --> 12:38.072
But he won't budge.
Something about Indiana.

12:38.140 --> 12:41.142
He turned you down
because of my job offer?

12:41.276 --> 12:43.009
I guess so.

12:43.077 --> 12:45.980
Must be hard for you to live
with that one on your shoulder.

12:47.382 --> 12:49.349
Look, I resent you trying
to make me feel guilty.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.222
Now, if you don't mind, we're
in the middle of a wedding.

12:51.252 --> 12:52.519
To which you were not invited.

12:52.587 --> 12:53.858
All right. But I'm
gonna lose my job.

12:53.888 --> 12:54.992
I'm terribly sorry.
Please, go.

12:55.022 --> 12:56.160
All right, I'm Morgan Wandell.

12:56.190 --> 12:58.959
- Yeah.
- I'm Morgan Wandell.

13:10.471 --> 13:13.440
So, how come your husband's not here?
Problems at home?

13:13.508 --> 13:16.276
No. He's away
on an assignment.

13:16.344 --> 13:19.413
Well, if you were my wife,
I wouldn't leave you alone.

13:19.481 --> 13:23.484
Well, I'm not your wife and you
still won't leave me alone.

13:29.891 --> 13:33.127
You are the most amazing
and wonderful man.

13:33.195 --> 13:35.729
Well, hold that thought.
The wedding's starting.

13:35.797 --> 13:38.666
And I got a lot of
money riding on this.

13:40.969 --> 13:43.671
They make a lovely couple.

13:43.738 --> 13:45.576
Well, they say when you live
together for a long time,

13:45.606 --> 13:48.208
you start looking
like each other.

13:59.921 --> 14:02.690
Oh, look. Trudy
looks so beautiful.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.526
The minister's starting.
All bets are down.

14:07.729 --> 14:08.929
Dearly beloved,

14:08.997 --> 14:13.334
we are gathered here for this
joyous and deeply moving...

14:13.401 --> 14:16.040
Are you gonna cry through this wedding
just like you did through ours?

14:16.070 --> 14:18.272
Yes. But this time
I'm happy.

14:22.076 --> 14:25.479
And I look forward to spending
the rest of my life with you,

14:25.547 --> 14:29.350
and to someday hear the pitter-patter
of little Borland feet.

14:30.852 --> 14:34.454
Do they make
a steel-toed work bootie?

14:34.522 --> 14:38.859
And now Al would like to recite
the vows that he wrote for Trudy.

14:38.861 --> 14:41.194
My darling Trudy,

14:41.263 --> 14:46.834
what more could a man ask for than to
be with a magnificent woman like you?

14:46.901 --> 14:51.905
You are my rock, my soul
mate and my partner

14:53.308 --> 14:55.276
through this journey
I like to call...

14:58.380 --> 14:59.380
Life.

15:01.515 --> 15:06.253
Come, my sweet princess, and
we shall walk hand in hand...

15:06.321 --> 15:08.688
Directly into <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

15:11.892 --> 15:13.893
Cal, the rings, please?

15:18.299 --> 15:22.102
Trudy, do you take Al to be
your lawfully wedded husband,

15:22.169 --> 15:26.506
for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health,

15:26.574 --> 15:28.008
till death do you part?

15:28.076 --> 15:29.710
I do.

15:29.778 --> 15:33.012
Al, do you take Trudy to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

15:33.080 --> 15:37.618
for better or for worse,
in sickness and in health,

15:37.685 --> 15:39.286
till death do you part?

15:39.353 --> 15:40.854
You bet I do.

15:45.594 --> 15:52.365
Now by the power vested in me
by the state of Michigan

15:52.433 --> 15:55.202
and the Church of
the Celestial Moon,

15:59.006 --> 16:03.176
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

16:03.244 --> 16:05.679
Al, you may kiss the bride.

16:21.162 --> 16:22.400
Jill, we're in
the middle of a wedding.

16:22.430 --> 16:23.468
What do you want to talk about?

16:23.498 --> 16:25.131
Please sit down in the hot rod.

16:25.199 --> 16:28.201
I don't care what it's about.

16:30.204 --> 16:33.807
I can't believe that you
turned down Binford for me.

16:33.875 --> 16:35.442
How did you find that out?

16:35.510 --> 16:38.345
Morgan stopped by to bribe
us with a cheese basket.

16:38.413 --> 16:41.515
What kind of cheese?

16:41.583 --> 16:43.250
Giving up that promotion
was the sweetest,

16:43.317 --> 16:45.051
most selfless thing
you've ever done.

16:45.119 --> 16:47.558
It's the least I could do for you,
honey, after all you've done for me.

16:47.588 --> 16:49.323
And you really deserve
this opportunity.

16:49.357 --> 16:51.124
Yeah, I know I do.
But I don't want it.

16:51.192 --> 16:52.592
I don't want to go to Indiana.

16:52.660 --> 16:54.498
This is exactly why I didn't
let you know about this.

16:54.528 --> 16:56.563
I knew you'd change
your mind because of me.

16:56.630 --> 16:58.498
I don't want to leave here!

16:58.566 --> 17:00.901
And this is an opportunity
that you have always wanted,

17:00.969 --> 17:03.003
to executive produce <i>Tool Time.</i>

17:03.071 --> 17:06.873
Look, if I can find a job like that in
Indiana, I can find one like that here.

17:06.941 --> 17:08.445
But not with Dr. Lee.
You said yourself

17:08.476 --> 17:11.044
this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

17:11.112 --> 17:13.347
Where are you guys going?

17:14.749 --> 17:17.451
Hop in. I'll tell
you all about it.

17:18.953 --> 17:22.256
Wait. We're not going to
Indiana now, are we?

17:23.625 --> 17:25.791
We're not going
to Indiana at all.

17:25.859 --> 17:27.661
- All right!
- Oh, shoot!

17:27.729 --> 17:29.563
- Yes, we are!
- All right!

17:29.631 --> 17:31.164
Okay. We're gonna
think about it.

17:31.232 --> 17:32.699
All right.

17:36.671 --> 17:38.872
All right, everybody.

17:38.940 --> 17:42.809
For the last 10 years, Al,
you've been my right-hand man.

17:42.877 --> 17:48.548
And you've not only been a big part of
my life, in many cases you've saved it.

17:48.616 --> 17:50.096
Trudy, you're getting
a hell of a guy.

17:50.151 --> 17:52.252
I know.

17:52.387 --> 17:55.622
It's a very special day. And if you're
wearing a certain kind of underwear,

17:55.690 --> 17:57.558
a very lucrative one.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.361
- To Al and Trudy!
- <i>To Al and Trudy!</i>

18:00.428 --> 18:04.130
<i>- Health and happiness!
- Health and happiness!</i>

18:04.198 --> 18:06.199
Hear, hear.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.168
All right.
I just want to say...

18:08.235 --> 18:11.204
I want to thank Tim and Jill

18:11.272 --> 18:16.610
for opening up
their house to us, and...

18:16.678 --> 18:20.213
Well, Tim, we've just...
We've gone through so much.

18:20.282 --> 18:24.117
And I... Well,
I want to thank you

18:24.185 --> 18:27.354
for giving me
my start on <i>Tool Time.</i>

18:29.190 --> 18:31.292
This has been a difficult year,

18:31.359 --> 18:34.628
and you guys have been there
for me every step of the way.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.298
And no matter where you
go or what you do,

18:37.365 --> 18:41.201
I just want you to know that
you'll always be my best friends.

18:42.136 --> 18:43.904
Al... Al...

18:43.971 --> 18:46.707
Oh, and, Trudy, thank
you for marrying me!

18:47.808 --> 18:50.377
- You're welcome.
- Trudy and Al!

18:50.445 --> 18:52.646
<i>- Trudy and Al.
- Trudy and Al!</i>

18:52.714 --> 18:54.081
All right.

18:55.784 --> 18:58.785
Oh, look. Al must've
dropped his wedding vows.

18:58.853 --> 19:00.787
We should put them
in a special place.

19:00.822 --> 19:02.656
Okay. Toss them in here.

19:04.993 --> 19:07.460
Look, your wedding arch
didn't fall down.

19:07.528 --> 19:11.131
Do you remember the last time
we were under one of those?

19:11.199 --> 19:14.801
We had no money, we had no kids.

19:14.869 --> 19:17.938
No idea how our lives
would turn out.

19:18.006 --> 19:21.641
I think, so far, they've
turned out pretty well.

19:21.709 --> 19:24.478
If you had to go back and do it
all over again, would you do it?

19:24.546 --> 19:27.847
Yeah. Yeah, I would.

19:27.915 --> 19:31.385
I mean, there's been
bumps along the road.

19:31.453 --> 19:33.387
I haven't always known
where we were headed.

19:33.455 --> 19:38.192
There was always a possibility
of a crash, but...

19:38.259 --> 19:41.161
I wouldn't want to travel
with anybody else.

19:42.630 --> 19:44.831
You?

19:44.899 --> 19:46.071
As a matter of fact,
I would change things.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.735
Yeah? What would
you change?

19:47.802 --> 19:51.772
I don't think I'd propose to you
in the back of a '68 Dodge Dart.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.373
273...
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay,

19:53.441 --> 19:55.142
what kind of car
would you choose?

19:55.210 --> 19:56.976
That's not what I mean.

19:57.044 --> 20:00.347
If I had to do it again, I'd
pick a more romantic spot.

20:01.983 --> 20:03.387
First time I looked at you,
I knew I wanted

20:03.417 --> 20:05.318
to spend the rest
of my life with you.

20:05.386 --> 20:09.089
Now 20 years later,
I have the same feelings.

20:09.157 --> 20:13.193
Except this numbness
in my thumb I can't explain.

20:13.261 --> 20:15.695
Jill Patterson,
would you marry me?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.098
No.

20:19.900 --> 20:21.734
No?

20:21.736 --> 20:24.571
I'm already married
to the perfect guy.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.651
I know you don't want
to go to Indiana.

20:37.719 --> 20:40.654
It's not about me.
It's about you.

20:40.722 --> 20:43.256
Do you want to give up
this opportunity?

20:43.324 --> 20:44.625
Yeah, I am.

20:44.692 --> 20:47.861
I don't want to
leave my life here.

20:47.929 --> 20:51.965
I just can't imagine
leaving this house.

21:02.810 --> 21:05.645
Well, if we ever decide to move,

21:05.713 --> 21:08.515
maybe we wouldn't have to
leave the house.

21:12.453 --> 21:14.221
What does that mean?

21:26.467 --> 21:28.601
Are we gonna drive this thing
the whole way?

21:28.669 --> 21:32.105
No. Don't be ridiculous. There's
faster ways to get there than by land.

21:32.173 --> 21:33.941
Like what?

21:35.343 --> 21:38.578
I didn't know
a tugboat could go this fast.

21:38.646 --> 21:40.713
It can if it's got more power!

21:49.991 --> 21:53.427
So, instead, we're just gonna show
you the proper way to do it, folks.

21:53.494 --> 21:56.029
Just get yourself a...

21:58.732 --> 22:00.500
Well...

22:02.536 --> 22:04.838
To Al and Heidi.
Health and happiness.

22:05.406 --> 22:07.474
Heidi?

22:08.642 --> 22:10.443
Who's Heidi?
