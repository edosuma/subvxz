WEBVTT

00:09.411 --> 00:12.129
Well, here we are.
Hedgewick's World -

00:12.187 --> 00:15.585
the biggest and best amusement
park there will ever be

00:15.587 --> 00:17.625
and we've got a golden ticket!

00:17.627 --> 00:20.305
Eh, eh? Fun! Fun?

00:20.307 --> 00:23.225
Your stupid box can't even get us
to the right place.

00:23.227 --> 00:26.505
This is, like, a moon base or
something. It's not the moon.

00:26.507 --> 00:30.345
Actually, I think it does
look like the moon. Only dirtier.

00:30.347 --> 00:33.065
Hey, guys it's not the moon, OK?

00:33.067 --> 00:35.305
It's a Spacey Zoomer ride, or it was.

00:35.307 --> 00:39.185
Psst! 'Scuse I. I don't suppose you
happen to be my lift off planet?

00:39.187 --> 00:41.985
Dave's Discount Interstellar
Removals? 'Fraid not.

00:41.987 --> 00:44.145
They were meant to be here six months ago.

00:44.147 --> 00:46.185
That's Dave for you, see, unreliable.

00:46.187 --> 00:48.705
Stay where you are! Oops.

00:48.707 --> 00:52.305
Throw down your weapons
and identify yourselves.

00:52.307 --> 00:54.745
No. No weapons! Golden ticket!

00:54.747 --> 00:56.865
Spacey Zoomer? Free ice cream?

00:56.867 --> 01:00.745
Who are you? This planet is
closed, by Imperial order.

01:00.747 --> 01:02.745
How's this?

01:02.747 --> 01:06.505
Oh. Welcome, Proconsul. I wish
they'd told us you were coming.

01:06.507 --> 01:07.985
Any news of the Emperor?

01:07.987 --> 01:11.905
Oh, the Emperor... 
No, no, none that you'd, er...

01:11.907 --> 01:13.465
We pray for his return.

01:13.467 --> 01:16.945
If there is anything you need,
my platoon is at your service.

01:16.947 --> 01:20.225
Right! Righty-oh.
Well, carry on, Captain.

01:20.227 --> 01:22.865
Platoon, let's move out.

01:22.867 --> 01:26.025
On the double. Two, three, four!
Two, three, four!

01:26.027 --> 01:27.347
Two, three, four!

01:29.067 --> 01:30.265
Have they gone?

01:30.267 --> 01:31.305
Yes.

01:31.307 --> 01:33.947
Uniforms give me the 
heebie-jeebies. Come on.

01:36.947 --> 01:39.465
They can't stop me being here,
but they don't like it.

01:39.467 --> 01:42.625
Ha-ha! You see?

01:42.627 --> 01:45.785
I told you it was amazing.
Well, it used to be.

01:45.787 --> 01:48.705
It closed down. Wish I'd known
that before I landed here.

01:48.707 --> 01:51.345
But let me show you my collection.

01:51.347 --> 01:54.507
Come along, follow me, this way.
This way in, come on.

01:55.507 --> 01:56.705
Welcome to my show...

01:56.707 --> 02:02.385
Webley's World of Wonders. 
Miracles, marvels and more await you.

02:02.387 --> 02:04.147
I am impresario Webley.

02:06.027 --> 02:12.305
You see before you waxwork
representations of the famous...

02:12.307 --> 02:14.665
and the infamous.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.667
Anybody here play chess?

02:18.107 --> 02:19.665
Perhaps you, young man?

02:19.667 --> 02:21.785
Actually, I'm in my school chess club.

02:21.787 --> 02:23.347
Ah, follow me.

02:27.147 --> 02:31.265
Now, let me demonstrate to 
you all the wonder of the age,

02:31.267 --> 02:33.025
the miracle of modernity.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.625
We defeated them all,
a thousand years ago.

02:35.627 --> 02:39.865
But now he's back, to destroy you.

02:39.867 --> 02:42.345
Behold! The enemy!

02:42.347 --> 02:44.187
Cyberman! Get down!

02:46.955 --> 03:19.558
# Dr. Who 7x12 #
Nightmare in Silver
Original Air Date on May 11, 2013

03:20.307 --> 03:22.265
No need to panic, my young friends.

03:22.267 --> 03:24.505
We all know there are 
no more living Cybermen.

03:24.507 --> 03:30.505
What you are seeing is a miracle -
the 699th wonder of the universe.

03:30.507 --> 03:33.225
As displayed before the Imperial court,

03:33.227 --> 03:36.065
and only here to destroy you - at chess!

03:36.067 --> 03:38.305
Careful now. An empty shell.

03:38.307 --> 03:40.665
And yet it moves.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.665
How? Magic.

03:42.667 --> 03:45.545
That might well be, young lady.

03:45.547 --> 03:50.585
A single penny wins you 
five Imperial shillings

03:50.587 --> 03:54.905
if you can beat this
empty shell at chess.

03:54.907 --> 03:58.505
I haven't got a penny.
But I've got a sandwich.

03:58.507 --> 04:00.267
All right, take a seat.

04:01.627 --> 04:07.147
It is free of all devices,
and yet it has never been beaten.

04:08.547 --> 04:11.467
Would you like to make 
the first move, young man?

04:17.346 --> 04:20.225
Oh, no, Artie.
No, don't do that, it...

04:20.226 --> 04:22.787
It's a fool's mate.

04:24.267 --> 04:27.945
If you can tell me how it works,
I'll give you a silver penny.

04:27.947 --> 04:30.267
I think... you do it with mirrors.

04:31.347 --> 04:36.665
Hmm, mirrors, clever girl.
Well, let's see, hey? Low tech.

04:36.667 --> 04:40.147
It's a puppet, monofilament strings,
which means the brains are in...

04:41.947 --> 04:46.307
Hello. Hello. I'm the brains.
Hello. Give us a hand.

04:50.907 --> 04:53.025
They call me Porridge.

04:53.027 --> 04:55.225
Ah, it's good to be out of that box.

04:55.227 --> 04:59.747
For you, Miss... an Imperial penny.

05:04.707 --> 05:08.027
I have not one but THREE
Cybermen in my collection.

05:10.787 --> 05:12.625
Is that the king? Emperor.

05:12.627 --> 05:16.705
Ludens Nimrod Kendrick, etc, etc,
the 41st - defender of humanity,

05:16.707 --> 05:19.785
imperator of known space.
He looks a bit full of himself.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.105
Don't say things like that
about the Imperial family -

05:22.107 --> 05:24.185
you can end up on the run
for the rest of your life.

05:24.187 --> 05:26.425
They don't sound very nice.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.385
Go on. If the kids want 
to ride the Spacey Zoomer,

05:29.387 --> 05:31.625
then I can operate the gravity console.

05:31.627 --> 05:32.947
Angie!

05:37.907 --> 05:40.585
Whoa!

05:40.587 --> 05:43.867
Smile! Say, "Spacey Zoomer!"

05:46.707 --> 05:49.107
We're flying! Having a good time?

05:56.187 --> 05:59.225
I think that was the most fun
I've had in my whole life.

05:59.227 --> 06:00.945
It was...

06:00.947 --> 06:02.307
OK.

06:03.507 --> 06:06.785
Clara? I think outer space is
actually very interesting.

06:06.787 --> 06:09.905
Right, wonderful day out, Doctor,
but it's time to get the kids home.

06:09.907 --> 06:13.065
Yeah. Um, no.
Not actually ready to leave.

06:13.067 --> 06:16.225
Why not? I dunno. Reasons.

06:16.227 --> 06:18.705
What reasons? Insects. Funny insects.

06:18.707 --> 06:21.425
I should add them to my 
funny insect collection.

06:21.427 --> 06:24.665
You collect funny insects?
Yeah, I'm starting to.

06:24.667 --> 06:26.147
Right now.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.785
How long do we have to stay here?

06:29.787 --> 06:32.905
Not long. Have a nap. I'll wake 
you when we're ready to leave.

06:32.907 --> 06:34.745
Comfy? Sleep well.

06:34.747 --> 06:36.067
Good night.

06:40.027 --> 06:41.785
Don't wander off.

06:41.787 --> 06:44.785
I'm not just saying,
"Don't wander off" - I MEAN it.

06:44.787 --> 06:48.585
Otherwise you'll wander off,
and the next thing you know,

06:48.587 --> 06:51.625
somebody's going to have 
to start rescuing somebody.

06:51.627 --> 06:55.147
From what? Nothing. Nobody 
needs rescuing from anything.

06:56.547 --> 06:58.665
Don't wander off.

06:58.667 --> 06:59.907
Sweet dreams.

07:01.000 --> 07:07.074

07:10.107 --> 07:13.625
Mmm. Mmm!

07:13.627 --> 07:16.665
Total takings for the day - one sandwich.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.505
Better than no sandwich, of course.

07:18.507 --> 07:21.787
Not as good as TWO sandwiches,
or even a chicken...

07:23.067 --> 07:24.705
That's a bit odd.

07:24.707 --> 07:27.667
That's not funny, give me my hands back.

07:37.867 --> 07:41.025
Upgrade in progress!

07:41.027 --> 07:43.345
I HATE the future. It's stupid.

07:43.347 --> 07:46.025
There's not even phone service.
I'm out of here.

07:46.027 --> 07:47.585
The Doctor said to not wander off.

07:47.587 --> 07:49.425
He said that,

07:49.427 --> 07:52.225
and then he wandered off.
I don't think Clara would like that.

07:52.227 --> 07:55.067
She's not our mum.
Don't leave me here.

07:58.187 --> 08:01.265
Was this really the biggest
amusement park in the universe?

08:01.267 --> 08:03.145
Yeah. Hedgewick bought the planet cheap.

08:03.147 --> 08:06.145
It'd been trashed in the Cyber-Wars.
Who were we fighting?

08:06.147 --> 08:10.265
Cybermen. Technologically upgraded
warriors. We couldn't win.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.665
Sometimes we fought to a draw,

08:11.667 --> 08:15.145
but then they'd upgrade themselves,
fix their weaknesses and destroy us.

08:15.147 --> 08:18.265
It's hard to fight an enemy that
uses your armies as spare parts.

08:18.267 --> 08:21.185
You beat them, though - beat them
or you wouldn't be here. How?

08:21.187 --> 08:24.865
Look up there - that corner
of the sky. What do you see?

08:24.867 --> 08:26.945
Nothing. It's just black.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.385
No stars, no nothing.

08:29.387 --> 08:33.945
Used to be the Tiberion Spiral
Galaxy. A million star systems.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.265
A hundred million worlds.
A billion trillion people.

08:37.267 --> 08:41.986
It's not there any more. No more
Tiberion galaxy. No more Cybermen.

08:43.587 --> 08:45.025
It was effective.

08:45.027 --> 08:47.865
It's horrible. Yeah.

08:47.867 --> 08:49.825
I feel like a monster sometimes.

08:49.827 --> 08:51.065
Why?

08:51.067 --> 08:54.145
Because instead of mourning
a billion trillion dead people,

08:54.147 --> 08:55.945
I just feel sorry for the poor blighter

08:55.947 --> 08:58.065
who had to press the 
button and blow it all up.

08:58.067 --> 09:01.505
Clara! Did you tell Angie
she could go to the barracks?

09:01.507 --> 09:02.945
You KNOW I didn't.

09:02.947 --> 09:05.785
She hasn't...
She's just gone in there.

09:05.787 --> 09:07.627
Come on.

09:10.027 --> 09:12.705
I can't fix this.
It can't be broken.

09:12.707 --> 09:15.225
It's a solid state sub-ether
ansible class communicator.

09:15.227 --> 09:16.785
Just run the diagnostics.

09:16.787 --> 09:20.385
There's nothing left to diagnose.
It's not broken. It's empty.

09:20.387 --> 09:23.985
All the components have gone. Well,
you must have replacement parts.

09:23.987 --> 09:25.585
Not enough to build a new one.

09:25.587 --> 09:28.265
Captain, the weather-controller
is malfunctioning again.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.865
There's storms, heat waves, snow.

09:29.867 --> 09:33.905
Hello. I'm bored!

09:33.907 --> 09:35.665
Where's your big sister?

09:35.667 --> 09:39.025
Clara? She's not my sister.
She's stupid.

09:39.027 --> 09:41.025
She's talking to Porridge.

09:41.027 --> 09:42.945
She talks to her porridge?

09:42.947 --> 09:44.867
Porridge. That little bloke.

09:47.707 --> 09:49.267
We need to have a chat.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.587
I'm not scared, if you're wondering.

09:58.707 --> 10:01.347
I just think I ought to
turn the lights back on.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.425
So, tell me about the little bloke.

10:39.427 --> 10:41.145
Well, you must have seen him.

10:41.147 --> 10:44.305
Angie, Angie! She has to 
turn up and spoil everything!

10:44.307 --> 10:47.907
I wasn't doing anything!
Why can't you just leave me alone?!

10:51.707 --> 10:53.025
Cyberman!

10:53.027 --> 10:55.425
Angie!

10:55.427 --> 10:57.027
Attack formation!

10:58.507 --> 10:59.907
No!

11:02.227 --> 11:04.187
Attack formation - quickly!

11:07.747 --> 11:10.345
Upgrade in progress!

11:10.347 --> 11:12.067
Angie!

11:25.907 --> 11:27.065
Angie! Clara, Clara...!

11:27.067 --> 11:29.185
That was a Cyberman!
But they're extinct.

11:29.187 --> 11:32.467
Listen to me, I will get her back.
Captain, a word, please.

11:33.907 --> 11:35.505
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

11:35.507 --> 11:38.225
but I take it your platoon
doesn't do much fighting?

11:38.227 --> 11:40.145
What do you expect? What?

11:40.147 --> 11:41.505
We're a punishment platoon.

11:41.507 --> 11:44.267
It's why they sent us out here,
so we can't get into trouble.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.625
Ah, right, right, well, OK.
As Imperial Consul,

11:49.627 --> 11:51.745
I am putting Clara in charge.

11:51.747 --> 11:53.305
Clara, stay alive until I get back,

11:53.307 --> 11:56.425
and don't let anyone blow up this planet.

11:56.427 --> 11:58.225
Is that something they're likely to do?

11:58.227 --> 12:00.505
Get to somewhere defensible.
Where are YOU going?

12:00.507 --> 12:04.185
I'm getting Angie, finding Artie
and looking for funny insects.

12:04.187 --> 12:08.667
Stay alive. And you lot,
no blowing up this planet!

12:14.267 --> 12:15.747
Put me down! I hate you!

12:18.347 --> 12:20.867
Artie? Artie, what's happening?

12:23.867 --> 12:25.505
Please stand by.

12:25.507 --> 12:27.947
You will be upgraded.

12:33.067 --> 12:36.465
Cyberiad class weaponry.
I've taken it out of storage.

12:36.467 --> 12:40.665
Good. We need to find 
somewhere defensible. Where?

12:40.667 --> 12:44.225
The beach, the Giant's Cauldron...

12:44.227 --> 12:46.265
Natty Longshoe's Comical Castle.

12:46.267 --> 12:48.425
Real castle? Drawbridge? Moat?

12:48.427 --> 12:49.905
Yes. But comical.

12:49.907 --> 12:51.625
We'll go there.

12:51.627 --> 12:54.385
Ma'am... My platoon can 
deal with one Cyberman.

12:54.387 --> 12:57.505
And there are protocols if we cannot
immediately find and destroy it.

12:57.507 --> 13:00.305
Blowing-up-the-planet protocols?
Respectfully, ma'am...

13:00.307 --> 13:02.545
Somewhere defensible.
No blowing up the planet.

13:02.547 --> 13:05.907
She's your commanding officer 
now, isn't she, Captain?

13:09.827 --> 13:11.227
Yes...

13:12.547 --> 13:13.707
sir.

13:17.707 --> 13:20.185
You really saw a Cyberman?
We really did.

13:20.187 --> 13:23.345
Have you reported it to the
Imperium? No communicators.

13:23.347 --> 13:25.345
So you're going to do what she says.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.587
Right, let's all spend the night
at Natty Longshoe's Comical Castle.

13:30.547 --> 13:31.747
Artie?

13:39.507 --> 13:40.985
Firstly,

13:40.987 --> 13:42.745
if anybody's watching this,

13:42.747 --> 13:46.385
those children are under my
protection. I'm coming to get them.

13:46.387 --> 13:48.745
And secondly...

13:48.747 --> 13:50.347
little metal machine...

13:51.787 --> 13:54.227
you are beautiful.

14:03.027 --> 14:05.307
Not even a Cybermat any more, eh?

14:07.027 --> 14:08.587
Cybermites?

14:14.667 --> 14:18.825
Now... there's a local 
transmat link open to your home.

14:18.827 --> 14:21.107
If I can just find the frequency...

14:24.547 --> 14:26.305
Hey, that really shouldn't have worked.

14:26.307 --> 14:28.627
Doctor, help us. Angie! Artie!

14:34.387 --> 14:39.265
Webley? We needed children,
but the children had stopped coming.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.985
You brought us children.

14:40.987 --> 14:45.707
Hail to you, the Doctor,
saviour of the Cybermen!

14:46.907 --> 14:49.905
What would the Empire do if 
they WERE alerted? I told you -

14:49.907 --> 14:51.465
tell me to blow up the planet.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.425
After they got us off?

14:53.427 --> 14:57.345
Captain, you want to take that one?
No, ma'am. Just blow the sucker up.

14:57.347 --> 14:59.305
Drawbridge, moat - brilliant.

14:59.307 --> 15:02.345
With respect, ma'am, we ought
to be hunting the creature.

15:02.347 --> 15:05.585
The only reason I'm still alive is
because I do what the Doctor says.

15:05.587 --> 15:09.465
Can you guarantee me you'd bring
back my children alive and unharmed?

15:09.467 --> 15:12.305
I trust the Doctor. 
You think he knows what he's doing?

15:12.307 --> 15:13.907
I'm not sure I'd go THAT far.

15:16.387 --> 15:19.865
As the battle raged between
humanity and the Cyberiad,

15:19.867 --> 15:23.985
the Cyber-Planners built a Valkyrie,
to save critically damaged units

15:23.987 --> 15:28.225
and bring them here and,
one by one, repair them.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.705
The people who vanished
from the amusement park -

15:30.707 --> 15:33.065
they were spare parts

15:33.067 --> 15:34.345
for repairs.

15:34.347 --> 15:37.825
We've upgraded ourselves.
The next model will be undefeatable.

15:37.827 --> 15:40.265
Nothing's undefeatable.

15:40.267 --> 15:43.945
We needed children to 
build a new Cyber-Planner.

15:43.947 --> 15:49.345
A child's brain, with its infinite
potential, is perfect for our needs.

15:49.347 --> 15:50.945
But we no longer need the children.

15:50.947 --> 15:54.785
The Cybermites have been 
scanning YOUR brain, Doctor.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.065
It's quite remarkable.

15:56.067 --> 16:00.305
Also completely useless to you.
Cybermen use human parts.

16:00.307 --> 16:03.505
I'm not human.

16:03.507 --> 16:05.705
You can't convert non-humans.

16:05.707 --> 16:09.625
Well, that was true a long time ago.
But we've upgraded ourselves.

16:09.627 --> 16:13.507
Current Cyber units use
almost any living components.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.547
Aaaargh!

16:28.627 --> 16:30.347
Incorporated. Yes.

16:32.267 --> 16:34.505
Unfamiliar pulmonary set-up.

16:34.507 --> 16:36.545
Nervous system hyperconductive.

16:36.547 --> 16:38.867
Remarkable brain processing speed.

16:40.427 --> 16:44.467
Ooh! Amazing!

16:45.907 --> 16:49.705
Get out of my head!
Stop rummaging in my mind!

16:49.707 --> 16:54.345
Just you try and stop me.
Ooh, who's Clara?

16:54.347 --> 16:57.985
Why are you thinking 
about her so much? Enough!

16:57.987 --> 17:01.507
Fascinating. A complete
mental block. Highly effective.

17:02.867 --> 17:04.425
Relax, relax.

17:04.426 --> 17:08.425
If you just relax, you will find this
a perfectly pleasant experience.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.665
You are being upgraded

17:09.666 --> 17:13.145
and incorporated into the 
Cyberiad as a Cyber-Planner.

17:13.146 --> 17:16.185
Get out of my head!

17:16.186 --> 17:18.585
What is this place?
A network? A hive?

17:18.587 --> 17:21.224
You're getting signals from
every Cyberman everywhere.

17:21.227 --> 17:22.666
How many of you are there?

17:25.587 --> 17:29.345
Oh... this is brilliant!

17:29.347 --> 17:33.945
I'm so clever already, and now
I'm a million times more clever.

17:33.947 --> 17:38.465
And what a brain! Not a human
brain, not even SLIGHTLY human.

17:38.467 --> 17:41.985
I mean, I'll have to completely
rewrite the neural interface,

17:41.987 --> 17:49.785
but this is going to be the 
most efficient Cyber-Planner!

17:49.787 --> 17:51.545
Not a great name, that, is it?

17:51.547 --> 17:55.705
I could call myself Mr Clever.

17:55.707 --> 17:59.225
So much raw data... Time Lords.

17:59.227 --> 18:03.905
There's information on
the Time Lords in here!

18:03.907 --> 18:07.345
Oh, this is just dreamy!

18:07.347 --> 18:12.387
Right, I'm allowing you access to
memories on Time Lord regeneration.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.065
Fantastic!

18:19.067 --> 18:20.785
I could regenerate now.

18:20.787 --> 18:22.545
Big blast of regeneration energy,

18:22.547 --> 18:24.825
burn out any little Cyber
widgets in my brain,

18:24.827 --> 18:26.745
along with everything
you're connected to.

18:26.747 --> 18:30.105
Don't want to. You diss me up,
who knows what we'll get next?

18:30.107 --> 18:31.547
But I can.

18:33.787 --> 18:36.025
Stalemate, then.

18:36.027 --> 18:39.465
One of us needs to control this head.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.305
We're too well-balanced.

18:41.307 --> 18:42.745
What did you say?

18:42.747 --> 18:44.865
No, no, no, I heard you.

18:44.867 --> 18:48.105
Rhetorical device to keep me
thinking about it a bit more.

18:48.107 --> 18:49.905
Stalemate.

18:49.907 --> 18:53.025
We each control 49.881% of this brain.

18:53.027 --> 18:55.825
0.238 of the brain is
still in the balance.

18:55.827 --> 18:57.745
Whoever gets this gets the whole thing.

18:57.747 --> 19:00.945
Do you play chess? The rules
of chess are in my memory banks.

19:00.947 --> 19:03.265
You're proposing we play
chess to end the stalemate?

19:03.267 --> 19:05.705
Winner takes all.
Nobody can access that portion

19:05.707 --> 19:07.627
of the brain without winning the game.

19:11.347 --> 19:12.747
You can't win!

19:14.267 --> 19:15.705
Try me.

19:15.707 --> 19:21.305
You understand, when I DO win,
the Cyberiad gets your brains

19:21.307 --> 19:24.147
and memories. All of it.

19:25.707 --> 19:27.865
When I win, you get out of my head,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.265
you let the children go,

19:30.267 --> 19:33.265
and nobody dies.

19:33.267 --> 19:37.227
You got that? Nobody dies!

19:43.307 --> 19:45.785
'Castle's clear.
Missy, confirm status.'

19:45.787 --> 19:48.107
All clear in the power station.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.865
It's Missy.

19:54.867 --> 19:57.145
Something's out there.

19:57.147 --> 19:59.305
'What do you mean?
Is it the Cyberman?'

19:59.307 --> 20:02.225
I don't know. I couldn't see it.
It was only for a moment.

20:02.227 --> 20:05.147
Can I hide? Is it OK if I hide?

20:07.387 --> 20:09.787
DON'T MOVE! I'M IN THE ARMY!

20:34.907 --> 20:38.625
Erm, ma'am, Missy said she saw
something, and then she went quiet.

20:38.627 --> 20:41.427
It's on its way, then.
Weapons! Show me.

20:42.627 --> 20:43.865
Only one gun?

20:43.867 --> 20:46.345
Cybermen have been extinct for 1,000 years.

20:46.347 --> 20:49.105
Even one Anti-Cyber Gun is a miracle.

20:49.107 --> 20:50.745
These things are hand-pulsars.

20:50.747 --> 20:52.625
Touch the back of a Cyberman's head,

20:52.627 --> 20:55.187
the electromagnetic pulse deactivates it.

20:56.227 --> 20:59.985
What's this for? Just a mad guess
here - it blows up the planet?

20:59.987 --> 21:01.825
Implodes it.
There's also a trigger unit.

21:01.827 --> 21:05.385
I'll have that, then. Is there any
other way to activate the bomb?

21:05.387 --> 21:08.465
It's set to respond to MY voice.
I have the verbal code.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.947
You will not activate it
without a direct order from me.

21:15.827 --> 21:17.785
I will follow my orders.

21:17.787 --> 21:21.067
Your orders come from me.
Don't they?

21:23.947 --> 21:26.705
You'll need to sign for 
that trigger unit, ma'am.

21:26.707 --> 21:28.105
Thanks.

21:28.107 --> 21:30.227
Mind if I take one of these?
Might be handy.

21:32.547 --> 21:36.267
Help yourself. I'll teach you
how to use it. Upstairs. Now.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.267
There. That was easy.

21:43.867 --> 21:47.105
The game... has just started.

21:47.107 --> 21:48.505
Doctor...

21:48.507 --> 21:52.025
why is there no record of you
anywhere in the databanks

21:52.027 --> 21:53.627
of the Cyberiad?

21:55.427 --> 21:58.145
Oh. You're good.

21:58.147 --> 22:01.465
You've been eliminating 
yourself from history.

22:01.467 --> 22:05.507
You know, you could be 
reconstructed by the hole you've left.

22:09.027 --> 22:11.905
Good point.
I'll do something about that.

22:11.907 --> 22:14.665
The rules of chess allow
only a finite number of moves.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.105
And I can use other Cyber 
units as remote processors.

22:17.107 --> 22:18.865
You cannot possibly win.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.865
I can. I know things you don't.

22:20.867 --> 22:23.265
For example, did you know...

22:23.267 --> 22:26.345
very early versions of the
Cyber operating system could be

22:26.347 --> 22:30.185
seriously scrambled by exposure to
things, like gold or cleaning fluid?

22:30.187 --> 22:35.465
And what's interesting is, you're
still running some of that code.

22:35.467 --> 22:37.265
Really?

22:37.267 --> 22:39.747
That's your secret weapon?

22:41.467 --> 22:42.907
Cleaning fluid?

22:44.787 --> 22:47.105
Nope. Gold.

22:47.107 --> 22:49.585
Ho-ho! Like a charm.

22:49.587 --> 22:51.145
Right, you, Cyber... Webley.

22:51.147 --> 22:53.625
And you, kid... things.

22:53.627 --> 22:57.067
I'll bring the chessboard.
Let's get out of here.

22:59.187 --> 23:01.187
You knew it was me.

23:03.307 --> 23:06.745
I was in the Imperial Guard on 
Caspertine. Mostly just parades.

23:06.747 --> 23:09.305
But I had the honour 
to guard the old Emperor

23:09.307 --> 23:10.625
during the ice picnic.

23:10.627 --> 23:13.905
When the snow bears came and 
danced for us. That was a day.

23:13.907 --> 23:16.865
We're a punishment platoon.
We can't beat a Cyberman.

23:16.867 --> 23:19.265
The Imperium has to know what's happening.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.265
Like you said, the communicators are out.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.905
The only way you can report 
this now is to activate the bomb.

23:23.907 --> 23:26.625
Yes. And I forbid you to do that.

23:26.627 --> 23:29.225
I don't get it. Why would 
you blow up a whole planet,

23:29.227 --> 23:31.945
and everybody on it, just 
to get rid of one Cyberman?

23:31.947 --> 23:34.825
We tried other ways.
But they only work sometimes.

23:34.827 --> 23:37.665
So now we take drastic action.
And it works.

23:37.667 --> 23:41.785
If you find a Cyberman and you
can't destroy it immediately,

23:41.787 --> 23:43.945
you implode the planet.

23:43.947 --> 23:46.465
I was sent here because 
I didn't follow orders.

23:46.467 --> 23:48.547
I can make up for that.

23:51.427 --> 23:52.825
Put it down, I forbid you!

23:52.827 --> 23:54.825
Yeah. What she said.

23:54.827 --> 23:57.265
You ran away. I will do
what I was brought up to do.

23:57.267 --> 24:00.585
Live for the Empire, fight
for the Empire, die for the Empire.

24:00.587 --> 24:06.105
This is Captain Alice Ferrin,
Imperial ID 19-delta-13B.

24:06.107 --> 24:07.225
Activate...

24:07.227 --> 24:09.147
Cyberman! Get down!

24:19.547 --> 24:21.985
The Doctor said to get 
somewhere easily defensible.

24:21.987 --> 24:24.545
But if we stay in the castle,
it'll pick us off one by one.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.747
We have to take it out.
Is that an order, ma'am?

24:31.547 --> 24:34.065
Yes. Good.

24:34.067 --> 24:35.745
You know what to do.

24:35.747 --> 24:37.585
Pulse to the back of the head.

24:37.587 --> 24:39.305
Fry the brain circuit interface.

24:39.307 --> 24:41.867
It's going to be hard
to get in close enough.

25:18.227 --> 25:21.545
I've heard about the Cybermen
since I was in my cradle.

25:21.547 --> 25:23.945
I'm not afraid of you!

25:23.947 --> 25:24.987
Now!

25:31.947 --> 25:34.147
Hold it right there!
What's happening to them?

25:39.107 --> 25:41.105
One more step, and I fire!

25:41.107 --> 25:42.905
Don't fire that.

25:42.907 --> 25:46.745
A pulse will deactivate them.
And anyway...

25:46.747 --> 25:48.945
it's a waste of charge.
We may need it again.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.987
You don't think that 
was the only one, then?

25:58.267 --> 26:00.305
Don't shoot, don't shoot! I'm nice!

26:00.307 --> 26:03.465
Please, don't shoot! Hey, Clara, you
haven't let them blow up the planet.

26:03.467 --> 26:06.905
Good job. Did you get the kids?
Are they all right?

26:06.907 --> 26:09.585
What's going on? Bit of a 
good news/bad news/good news again

26:09.587 --> 26:12.865
thing going on. So... Good news -
I've kidnapped their Cyber-Planner,

26:12.867 --> 26:15.345
and right now I'm sort of
in control of this Cyberman.

26:15.347 --> 26:18.345
Bad news? Bad news - the 
Cyber-Planner's in my head.

26:18.347 --> 26:25.185
And DIFFERENT bad news - the 
kids are... Well, it's complicated.

26:25.187 --> 26:26.825
Complicated how?

26:26.827 --> 26:29.947
Complicated, as in walking coma.

26:35.067 --> 26:37.225
Please tell me you can
wake them up. Hope so.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.465
Other good news?
Well, in other good news,

26:39.467 --> 26:42.985
there are a few more repaired and
reactivated Cybermen on the way.

26:42.987 --> 26:45.865
And the Cyber-Planner's installing
a patch for the gold thing.

26:45.867 --> 26:49.585
No, wait, that isn't not 
good news, is it? Um, so...

26:49.587 --> 26:52.585
Good news - I have a very good
chance of winning my chess match.

26:52.587 --> 26:55.825
What? I'll explain later.
In a bit of a hurry.

26:55.827 --> 26:57.305
Get me to a table.

26:57.307 --> 26:59.345
And somebody tie me up!

26:59.347 --> 27:00.867
Need hands free for chess.

27:02.547 --> 27:04.145
And immobilise me.

27:04.147 --> 27:05.547
Quickly.

27:06.707 --> 27:09.665
Right, that's good. I won't be able
to move, but... hands free. Good.

27:09.667 --> 27:12.307
You're playing chess with
yourself? And winning.

27:13.627 --> 27:15.625
Actually,

27:15.627 --> 27:17.025
he has no better than a 25% chance

27:17.027 --> 27:19.025
of winning at this stage in the game.

27:19.027 --> 27:22.625
Some very dodgy moves at the 
beginning. Hello, flesh-girl.

27:22.627 --> 27:25.665
Fantastic! I'm the Cyber-Planner.

27:25.667 --> 27:28.945
Doctor...? Afraid not.
I'm working the mouth now. Allons-y!

27:28.947 --> 27:31.425
Oh, you should see the 
state of these neurons -

27:31.427 --> 27:33.705
he's had some cowboys in here.
Ten complete re-jigs.

27:33.707 --> 27:37.785
You aren't the Doctor.
No, but I know who YOU are.

27:37.787 --> 27:39.667
You're the impossible girl.

27:40.707 --> 27:43.945
Ooh, he's very interested in you.

27:43.947 --> 27:45.385
Why am I impossible?

27:45.387 --> 27:47.505
Hasn't he told you? The sly devil.

27:47.507 --> 27:50.785
Oh, dear me. Soon, we wake, we'll
strip you down for spare parts,

27:50.787 --> 27:52.745
then build a spaceship and move on.

27:52.747 --> 27:55.705
More Cybermen? They're waking
from their tomb right now.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.105
You can either die or
live on as one of us.

27:58.107 --> 28:01.265
The Doctor will stop you.
He can't even access the lips.

28:01.267 --> 28:03.745
Owwww!

28:03.747 --> 28:06.345
Ow! Oh, that hurt! No, stop!

28:06.347 --> 28:10.265
Enough! Bit of pain, neural surge -
just what I needed. Thanks.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.905
Why am I the impossible girl?

28:11.907 --> 28:14.785
It's a thing in my head. I'll
explain later. Chess game - stakes?

28:14.787 --> 28:17.625
If he wins, I give up my mind and
he gets access to all my memories,

28:17.627 --> 28:19.225
along with knowledge of time travel.

28:19.227 --> 28:22.345
But if I win, he'll break his 
promises to get out of my head

28:22.347 --> 28:24.585
and then kill us anyway.
That's not reassuring. No.

28:24.587 --> 28:27.105
Please tell me you can fix what
happened to the children.

28:27.107 --> 28:28.585
Children. Yeah. They're fine.

28:28.587 --> 28:30.905
Right now their brains
are just in stand-by mode.

28:30.907 --> 28:33.705
That is not fine! Listen, right now,

28:33.707 --> 28:38.025
they have a better chance of getting
out of all this alive than you do.

28:38.027 --> 28:39.867
Which one of you said that?

28:41.387 --> 28:46.505
Me. Cyber-Planner. Mr Clever.
Now, if you don't mind,

28:46.507 --> 28:49.425
I have a chess game to finish.

28:49.427 --> 28:55.387
And YOU have to die -
pointlessly and very far from home.

28:57.907 --> 28:59.067
Toodle-oo.

29:03.547 --> 29:05.745
Apparently there are 
more Cybermen on the way.

29:05.747 --> 29:08.105
There's at least a dozen 
more shots left in the gun

29:08.107 --> 29:09.505
before it needs to recharge.

29:09.507 --> 29:11.985
We might have more than a dozen
Cybermen to worry about.

29:11.987 --> 29:13.945
What's that cable?
Power line for the park.

29:13.947 --> 29:16.745
What'd happen if we dropped the
end into the moat and turned it on?

29:16.747 --> 29:18.585
Fry anything that entered the water.

29:18.587 --> 29:20.865
Can Cybermen fly? No, ma'am.

29:20.867 --> 29:23.107
First good news of the day. Do it.

29:39.707 --> 29:42.945
Stop that! I felt that.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.667
Of course you did.
It's time to get up.

29:47.107 --> 29:50.705
Wakey wakey, boys and girls.

29:50.707 --> 29:54.147
Wakey wakey.

30:21.467 --> 30:25.305
There. Get that in you. Warm you up.
Oh, thank you, Porridge.

30:25.307 --> 30:27.665
Oi, Clara!

30:27.667 --> 30:31.307
I'll see what he wants.
Call me if there's any change. Right.

30:38.747 --> 30:42.305
Hey! Clara, there you are.
Now, quick rundown.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.985
What's our weapons strength?

30:43.987 --> 30:46.265
One big gun, five of 
those hand pulsar units

30:46.267 --> 30:49.425
and a shiny black bomb that 
implodes the planet. Yeah. That one.

30:49.427 --> 30:52.505
Tell me, does it happen, possibly,
to have a remote triggery thing?

30:52.507 --> 30:54.145
Brilliant. Pass it here. No.

30:54.147 --> 30:56.105
Why not?
In case you're not you right now.

30:56.107 --> 30:58.785
Or even if you are you, just in case.
Oh, don't worry.

30:58.787 --> 31:03.745
The Cyber-Planner's hibernating
between moves right now. Sssh.

31:03.747 --> 31:07.747
Prove you're you. Tell me
something only the Doctor knows.

31:11.067 --> 31:12.587
Clara...

31:14.067 --> 31:16.265
I suppose...

31:16.267 --> 31:20.347
I'm the only one who knows
how I feel about you right now.

31:21.787 --> 31:24.507
How funny you are - so funny...

31:25.987 --> 31:28.145
and pretty.

31:28.147 --> 31:31.745
And the truth is,
I'm starting to like you

31:31.747 --> 31:33.665
in a way that is more than just...

31:33.667 --> 31:38.265
Ow! Ow! Ow! Yes! It's me!

31:38.267 --> 31:40.945
That really hurt!
How did you know that was him?!

31:40.947 --> 31:43.505
Because even if that WAS true -
which it's obviously not -

31:43.507 --> 31:45.705
I know you that you would 
rather die than say it.

31:45.707 --> 31:47.227
Finish your stupid game!

31:49.067 --> 31:52.385
Doctor, let go. I can't.
He's got control of the left arm.

31:52.387 --> 31:56.345
Aaargh! Aaaargh! No! No!

31:56.347 --> 32:00.027
Aaargh! Aaargh! Aaargh!

32:02.467 --> 32:03.985
Doctor?

32:03.987 --> 32:06.705
He got what he wanted.
He destroyed the trigger.

32:06.707 --> 32:09.305
My move. What do you mean,
he got what he wanted?

32:09.307 --> 32:11.305
He means...

32:11.307 --> 32:14.985
good news, boys and girls!

32:14.987 --> 32:18.987
THEY'RE HEERE!

32:37.627 --> 32:38.865
One gun, five hand pulsars

32:38.867 --> 32:41.425
and a planet-smashing bomb
that doesn't work any more.

32:41.427 --> 32:43.505
Why not? Broken trigger unit.

32:43.507 --> 32:45.345
But you signed for that.

32:45.347 --> 32:49.185
I've learned so much from you, Doctor.

32:49.187 --> 32:51.065
It's been an education.

32:51.067 --> 32:55.147
But now it's time for the endgame.

33:09.627 --> 33:10.787
Brilliant.

33:12.547 --> 33:15.067
Upgrade in progress.

33:16.347 --> 33:17.667
Damn.

33:19.227 --> 33:22.065
Who's our best shot?
Probably it's me.

33:22.067 --> 33:24.105
Shoot any of them who make it across.

33:24.107 --> 33:26.825
The rest of you, take 
defensive positions. Porridge?

33:26.827 --> 33:28.427
Yes? Keep yourself safe.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.745
Alice Ferrin...

33:45.747 --> 33:49.065
you should have destroyed this
planet when you had the chance.

33:49.067 --> 33:51.425
They're nearly here.

33:51.427 --> 33:56.465
Now, you can take my bishop and
keep limping on for a little longer.

33:56.467 --> 34:00.505
Or you can sacrifice your queen,

34:00.507 --> 34:03.025
and get the children back,

34:03.027 --> 34:05.065
but it's mate in five moves.

34:05.067 --> 34:07.387
And I get your mind.

34:16.827 --> 34:21.547
Take my queen.
And give me back the children.

34:23.107 --> 34:26.824
Emotions! Can't you see
what a foolish move that was?

34:26.827 --> 34:28.945
You've lost the game!

34:28.947 --> 34:32.027
Kids! Back! Now!

34:41.667 --> 34:45.585
Emotions, Doctor -

34:45.587 --> 34:50.465
all for two human children you barely know.

34:50.467 --> 34:53.147
And it was a pointless sacrifice anyway.

34:56.306 --> 34:58.305
So, Doctor...

34:58.307 --> 35:02.745
do you think the children's death
will affect your relationship

35:02.747 --> 35:04.467
with Miss Clara?

35:08.827 --> 35:11.945
Welcome to Webley's 
World Of Wonders, children.

35:11.947 --> 35:16.385
Now presenting delights, delicacies...

35:16.387 --> 35:18.787
and death. Doctor!

35:23.947 --> 35:27.627
Angie, are you, OK?
Just look after Artie, OK?

35:38.627 --> 35:40.905
Upgrade in progress.

35:40.907 --> 35:43.505
Your move. But before you
take it, just so you know,

35:43.507 --> 35:46.745
sacrificing my queen was the best
possible move I could have made.

35:46.747 --> 35:48.385
The Time Lords invented chess.

35:48.387 --> 35:49.905
It's our game.

35:49.907 --> 35:53.385
And if you don't avoid MY trap,
it gives ME mate in three moves.

35:53.387 --> 35:54.667
How?

35:56.387 --> 35:58.187
I've got no charge left!

36:02.867 --> 36:04.067
How?

36:08.107 --> 36:10.425
Oh, come on. Call yourself
a chess-playing robot?

36:10.427 --> 36:11.587
How?!

36:16.267 --> 36:18.347
You figure it out!

36:22.147 --> 36:26.025
Or don't you have the
processing power? Hmm?

36:26.027 --> 36:29.585
Please stand by - you will be upgraded.

36:29.587 --> 36:32.465
Welcome to the Cyberiad.

36:32.467 --> 36:33.545
You will be upgraded.

36:33.547 --> 36:36.105
Welcome to the Cyberiad.

36:36.107 --> 36:37.625
You will be upgraded...

36:37.627 --> 36:40.987
You will be upgraded...

36:47.907 --> 36:49.105
What are you doing?

36:49.107 --> 36:52.425
Doctor. Doctor, Doctor, Doctor,

36:52.427 --> 36:54.945
Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor!

36:54.947 --> 36:57.065
I'm pulling in extra processing power.

36:57.067 --> 37:00.105
Three million Cyberbrains are
working on one tiny chess problem.

37:00.107 --> 37:02.625
How long do you think it's
going to take us to solve it?

37:02.627 --> 37:07.105
That's cheating! No, no, no, no, no.
Just pulling in the local resources.

37:07.107 --> 37:08.747
Woo-oo-oo.

37:14.747 --> 37:18.745
There's no way you can 
get to mate in three moves.

37:18.747 --> 37:21.265
Three moves!
Want to know what they are?

37:21.267 --> 37:22.625
You're lying!

37:22.627 --> 37:24.265
No!

37:24.267 --> 37:26.345
Move one -

37:26.347 --> 37:28.505
turn on sonic screwdriver.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.185
Move two - activate pulsar.

37:30.187 --> 37:32.227
Move three - amplify pulsar.

37:35.387 --> 37:37.787
See ya.

37:39.867 --> 37:41.547
That's cheating!

37:46.147 --> 37:48.625
Just taking advantage
of the local resources.

37:48.627 --> 37:52.065
Ah, hello. Can someone untie me,
please? Do you think I'm pretty?

37:52.067 --> 37:54.625
No! You're too short and bossy,
and your nose is all funny.

37:54.627 --> 37:56.905
Good enough. What happened
to the Cyber-Planner?

37:56.907 --> 37:59.665
Out of my head and redistributed
across three million Cybermen.

37:59.667 --> 38:02.465
About to wake them up, kill us
and start constructing a spaceship.

38:02.467 --> 38:05.345
We need to destroy this planet
before they can get off it.

38:05.347 --> 38:07.305
OK.

38:07.307 --> 38:09.225
It has a fallback voice activation.

38:09.227 --> 38:11.225
The Captain. But she's dead.

38:11.227 --> 38:13.305
I think you should ask Porridge. Why?

38:13.307 --> 38:17.345
Well, he is the Emperor. I bet
HE knows the activation codes.

38:17.347 --> 38:19.305
Oh, come on, it's obvious.

38:19.307 --> 38:21.185
He looks exactly like he does on the coin

38:21.187 --> 38:24.065
and on the waxwork, except they
made him a bit taller, but...

38:24.067 --> 38:26.865
Look, am I the only one paying
attention to ANYTHING around here?

38:26.867 --> 38:29.465
You are full of surprises. Porridge?

38:29.467 --> 38:32.145
She's right. So you can save us?

38:32.147 --> 38:34.305
We all die in the end.
Does it matter how?

38:34.307 --> 38:37.345
What do we do?
I don't want to be Emperor.

38:37.347 --> 38:40.305
If I activate that bomb, it's all over.

38:40.307 --> 38:41.345
And if you don't,

38:41.347 --> 38:44.145
three million Cybermen will
spread across the galaxy.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.625
Isn't that worth dying for?

38:45.627 --> 38:47.467
Doctor... Three million Cybermen!

38:51.107 --> 38:54.105
The bomb, the throne, it's all connected.

38:54.107 --> 38:55.265
I just have to say,

38:55.267 --> 38:59.185
"This is Emperor Ludens Nimrod
Kendrick, called Longstaff the 41st,

38:59.187 --> 39:03.427
"the defender of humanity,
imperator of known space.

39:05.787 --> 39:09.067
"Activate the Desolator."
And it's done.

39:16.827 --> 39:18.385
It'll blow in about 80 seconds.

39:18.387 --> 39:20.825
Easily long enough for the
Imperial Flagship to locate me

39:20.827 --> 39:24.025
from my identification,
warp-jump into orbit,

39:24.027 --> 39:25.947
and transmat us to the State Room.

39:31.987 --> 39:34.865
Oh, yeah! Nice ship.

39:34.867 --> 39:36.505
Bit big. Not blue enough.

39:36.507 --> 39:41.145
Listen, there is a large blue box
at co-ordinates six ultra 19P.

39:41.147 --> 39:44.345
I need it transmatted up here right away.

39:44.347 --> 39:46.307
Right. Did you get that?

39:56.107 --> 40:01.947
And that's that. 76, 77, 78, 79...

40:10.467 --> 40:13.145
Fairwell, Cyberiad.

40:13.147 --> 40:16.465
You know... it was GOOD to get away.

40:16.467 --> 40:19.025
Good to be a person and not to be lonely

40:19.027 --> 40:21.105
or Emperor of 1,000 galaxies,

40:21.107 --> 40:23.425
with everybody waiting for ME
to tell them what to do.

40:23.427 --> 40:24.985
Can't you run away again?

40:24.987 --> 40:27.025
They'll be keeping a 
close eye on me this time.

40:27.027 --> 40:28.985
That's what happens when you're Emperor -

40:28.987 --> 40:30.905
loneliest job in the Universe.

40:30.907 --> 40:32.587
You don't have to be lonely.

40:34.627 --> 40:37.145
I don't.

40:37.147 --> 40:38.665
Clara...

40:38.667 --> 40:40.147
will you marry me?

40:41.147 --> 40:42.665
What? He said...

40:42.667 --> 40:44.025
She heard what he said.

40:44.027 --> 40:46.625
You're smart and you're beautiful,

40:46.627 --> 40:49.385
and I've never met anyone like you before.

40:49.387 --> 40:52.185
And being Emperor won't be 
as hard if you're by my side.

40:52.187 --> 40:54.025
And you'd rule 1,000 galaxies.

40:54.027 --> 40:57.185
This sounds like an actual
marriage proposal - tricky.

40:57.187 --> 40:58.425
Now, if you want my advice...

40:58.427 --> 41:01.867
You - not one word. This is
between me and the... Emperor.

41:04.147 --> 41:05.865
Porridge,

41:05.867 --> 41:09.707
I...don't want to rule 1,000 galaxies.

41:13.467 --> 41:14.507
Yeah.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.425
Silly of me.

41:17.427 --> 41:19.105
I'm really sorry.

41:19.107 --> 41:23.145
But that's stupid.
You could be queen of the universe.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.425
How can you say no to that?

41:25.427 --> 41:28.025
When someone asks you if you want
to be queen of the universe,

41:28.027 --> 41:29.225
you say, "Yes."

41:29.227 --> 41:32.147
You watch. One day, I'LL
be queen of the universe.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.465
Of course, I could have you all executed -

41:36.467 --> 41:38.747
which is what a proper Emperor would do.

41:39.907 --> 41:42.425
You're not actually going to 
do that, though, are you...?

41:42.427 --> 41:44.865
Oh, you're...! Hey?

41:44.867 --> 41:46.905
Go on, get out of here, all of you,

41:46.907 --> 41:48.387
before I change my mind.

42:02.867 --> 42:05.305
Thank you for having me.
It was very interesting.

42:05.307 --> 42:07.105
My pleasure. Thank you for coming.

42:07.107 --> 42:08.905
Now, I've got something for you.

42:08.907 --> 42:11.107
It's not from me, it's from the TARDIS.

42:12.947 --> 42:15.345
Ah! New phone.

42:15.347 --> 42:18.507
Thanks!
Sorry I said this box was stupid.

42:20.107 --> 42:24.707
Bye! Bye! Thanks, Clara.
Thanks, Clara's boyfriend.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.585
Thank you, Doctor. For what?

42:28.587 --> 42:30.705
Kids' day out, getting 
us off the planet alive,

42:30.707 --> 42:32.827
whatever you were doing with the Cybermen...

42:35.667 --> 42:36.987
Good night.

42:38.587 --> 42:40.065
See you next Wednesday.

42:40.067 --> 42:44.505
Well... a Wednesday, definitely.
Next Wednesday, last Wednesday...

42:44.507 --> 42:45.947
one of the Wednesdays.

42:48.987 --> 42:51.105
Impossible girl.

42:51.107 --> 42:53.905
A mystery wrapped in an
enigma squeezed into a skirt

42:53.907 --> 42:56.747
that's just a little bit too... tight.

43:03.267 --> 43:04.787
What are you?

43:06.747 --> 43:09.065
Signs of any Cybertech remaining?

43:09.067 --> 43:10.945
No, Majesty.

43:10.947 --> 43:13.225
You ever wanted to be Emperor, Gloria?

43:13.227 --> 43:14.545
No, Majesty.

43:14.547 --> 43:17.707
That's the right answer.
Come on. Let's go home.

43:35.547 --> 43:38.665
There is one place you must never go.

43:38.667 --> 43:40.185
Where?

43:40.187 --> 43:42.945
This is the Doctor's greatest secret.

43:42.947 --> 43:44.585
And it is discovered.

43:44.587 --> 43:46.825
He can't go there, you know
he can't. I have a duty.

43:46.827 --> 43:49.065
You just said it's the one
place you must never go.

43:49.067 --> 43:52.227
I'm about to cross my own timeline
and the TARDIS doesn't like it.

43:55.827 --> 43:57.425
Die, reptile!

43:57.427 --> 43:59.305
Doctor! Doctor!

43:59.307 --> 44:00.985
What is your name?

44:00.987 --> 44:02.985
Please, stop it!

44:02.987 --> 44:04.507
Doctor Who?!
