Agent Sarah Walker, you're under arrest.
What?!

00:12.144 --> 00:13.878
<i>It was all a setup</i>

00:13.946 --> 00:15.679
to establish my cover
as a double agent.

00:15.747 --> 00:18.315
I'm going undercover
into Volkoff Industries.

00:18.383 --> 00:20.183
I'm going to take them down
from the inside.

00:20.251 --> 00:21.885
That's exactly how
I lost my mom.

00:21.953 --> 00:23.620
That's exactly how you're
going to get her back, Chuck.

00:23.687 --> 00:24.955
I'm doing this for you, okay?

00:25.023 --> 00:26.856

Huh.

01:05.694 --> 01:08.795
Any-who, uh, I have not
seen Chuck. What's up?

01:08.863 --> 01:10.197
Well, Walker's been
all over Europe,

01:10.265 --> 01:11.698
taking jobs as a rogue agent.

01:11.766 --> 01:12.833
Volkoff's finally noticing.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.134
Want to make sure
Chuck's in the loop.

01:14.202 --> 01:15.535
That's great news.

01:15.603 --> 01:18.272
But seeing as how Chuck is not
here, do you have a second

01:18.340 --> 01:20.240
to have a little chitchat
with me, man-to-man?

01:20.308 --> 01:21.808
Yeah, sure.

01:21.876 --> 01:23.409
Yeah, but...

01:23.477 --> 01:24.410
Listen...

01:24.478 --> 01:25.478

Hmm.

Bit out of character.

07:07.942 --> 07:10.309
That is a wicked idea.

07:10.377 --> 07:12.211
Thank you.

07:12.279 --> 07:14.347

07:14.414 --> 07:16.748
break out Yuri the Gobbler.

07:16.816 --> 07:20.118
Now, don't ask why
he's called that.

07:20.186 --> 07:23.355
It's because he eats people.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.519
What? She can't use
voice communication

07:55.586 --> 07:57.186
when she's undercover,
so the CIA developed

07:57.254 --> 07:59.489
a tonal language for us,
that only we understand.

07:59.557 --> 08:00.824
Get out of here.

08:00.892 --> 08:02.893
And right now, she's...

08:02.960 --> 08:05.127
she's saying she loves me.

08:06.730 --> 08:08.998
Or she's planning on buying a
Buick, I can't really tell.

08:09.065 --> 08:10.733
It's a very confusing
language; lot of nuances.

08:10.800 --> 08:12.267
It's beeps and things,
it's... I can understand.

08:12.335 --> 08:14.003
Morgan!
Can I borrow

08:14.070 --> 08:16.371
your T-shirt?
But of course.

08:16.439 --> 08:18.007
I gather things are
going well with Alex?

08:18.074 --> 08:19.408

Three. Three.
Hey, Chuck.

08:27.416 --> 08:29.116

09:13.659 --> 09:16.260
Totally.

09:16.328 --> 09:17.896

No. I'm cool.

09:19.865 --> 09:21.466
Excuse me?

09:21.533 --> 09:23.902
Nah, she looked... just...
really cute in it, didn't she?

09:23.970 --> 09:26.169
Let me ask you
a quick question.

09:26.237 --> 09:27.605
What the hell's wrong with me?

09:27.672 --> 09:29.306
Nothing's wrong with you,
my friend... but I have

09:43.120 --> 09:44.921
Wow. Do I tell her?

09:44.989 --> 09:49.291
Well, that's...
that's a... kind of big deal.

09:49.359 --> 09:50.693
Morgan!

09:50.761 --> 09:51.961
Are you coming?

09:52.029 --> 09:54.130
Let's finish this conversation
at the Buy More.

09:54.197 --> 09:56.965
I have some more
snuggling to do, and...

09:57.033 --> 09:58.500
no, I'm not embarrassed
I just said that.

10:10.579 --> 10:12.747
Stop exactly where you are.

10:14.382 --> 10:16.117
There is one square meter

10:16.184 --> 10:17.785
of land on the entire compound

10:17.853 --> 10:19.687
that is never
under surveillance,

10:19.755 --> 10:21.288
and we are currently
standing on it.

10:21.356 --> 10:22.690
Mrs. Bartowski,
I came here

10:22.758 --> 10:23.724
to help you take down Volkoff

10:23.792 --> 10:25.392
and get you the
hell out of here.

10:25.460 --> 10:28.029
Which is why I want you
to break free Yuri.

10:28.096 --> 10:29.896
He's Volkoff's
most trusted bodyguard,

10:29.964 --> 10:31.965
but I think he has
something to do the Hydra.

10:32.033 --> 10:33.133
Hydra?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.333
Volkoff's network.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.670
A database of
weapons buyers, sellers...

10:36.737 --> 10:38.138
his entire infrastructure.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.572
Early on, I realized

10:39.640 --> 10:41.174
that Hydra is more important

10:41.241 --> 10:42.375
than Volkoff himself.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.743
So how does
the bodyguard fit in?

10:43.811 --> 10:45.110
I really don't know.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.611
But since Yuri was arrested,

10:46.680 --> 10:48.647
Volkoff's communications
with his network

10:48.715 --> 10:50.248
have slowed to a stop.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.184
We should go.

10:52.251 --> 10:54.352
Sarah, I need you to realize

10:54.420 --> 10:56.254
that going undercover
in a place like this

10:56.322 --> 10:58.691
can require
certain difficult choices.

10:58.758 --> 10:59.858
I'm well aware.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.693
You might find yourself
becoming someone

11:01.727 --> 11:03.961
you no longer recognize.

11:05.397 --> 11:08.332
I'm willing to do
whatever it takes.

11:13.505 --> 11:16.407
Oh, good, I was, uh, I was
just coming over to see you.

11:16.474 --> 11:17.407
Really. About what?

11:17.474 --> 11:18.709
Well, I'm having a bit

11:18.776 --> 11:20.143
of an issue with Devon,
and I was hoping

11:20.211 --> 11:21.511
that you could help.
I told you

11:21.579 --> 11:23.513
I can't get him to stop
cooking with no shirt on.

11:23.581 --> 11:24.981
It's not that.

11:25.049 --> 11:26.216
I keep proposing baby names,

11:26.283 --> 11:28.852
and he keeps shooting 'em
down, one after another.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.020
Nothing works.

11:30.088 --> 11:31.855
That's ridiculous.
I'm sorry, El.

11:31.923 --> 11:33.222
It's just that naming the baby

11:33.289 --> 11:35.457
is the last planning that
we have to do before I can

11:35.525 --> 11:37.927
just relax
and focus on the birth.

11:37.994 --> 11:38.928
You know?
Yeah.

11:38.995 --> 11:39.929
No, yeah, totally.

11:39.996 --> 11:41.197
W-W-What can I do to help?

11:41.264 --> 11:45.634
Well, I, I finally picked
the perfect name

11:45.702 --> 11:47.002
and I don't want him
to shoot it down.

11:47.070 --> 11:48.937
It's the most beautiful,

11:49.004 --> 11:52.306
unique, precious name
for a girl.

11:53.442 --> 11:54.275
Well, don't keep me waiting.

11:54.343 --> 11:55.443
What is it?
Tell me.

11:55.510 --> 11:57.445
Gr.nka?

11:57.512 --> 11:59.447
I can't believe she's
going to name her Gr.nka.

11:59.514 --> 12:01.482
Dude. Dude.
Dude. Dude.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.317
We can't.
You can't.

12:03.385 --> 12:04.985
Gr.nka isn't what you name
your beautiful baby girl.

12:05.053 --> 12:07.587
It's what you name...

12:07.655 --> 12:09.456
these people.

12:09.523 --> 12:11.992
Ellie said she wants
the name to be original.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.227
Right?
Mm-hmm.

12:13.294 --> 12:14.327
I think I may know a way

12:14.395 --> 12:17.264
to stop this Gr.nka
in its tracks.

12:23.637 --> 12:25.371
Hey.

12:25.438 --> 12:26.605
Saw Alex leaving your apartment

12:26.673 --> 12:28.407
this morning...

12:28.475 --> 12:30.476
wearing your shirt.

12:30.543 --> 12:32.945
Hmm, right, Alex.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.081
Uh, yeah, see,
that's because, uh...

12:36.216 --> 12:37.916
...she didn't have a shirt.
Hmm?

12:37.984 --> 12:40.185
She... well, what,
what I was meaning to say is

12:40.253 --> 12:41.787
she couldn't,
she couldn't find her shirt.

12:41.854 --> 12:44.189
It was pretty cold,
so we wear lots of shirts,

12:44.257 --> 12:45.423
and it's like
a shirt party, you know.

12:45.491 --> 12:46.424
It's kind of a...

12:46.492 --> 12:47.425
Please don't kill me.

12:47.493 --> 12:48.426
Okay?

12:48.494 --> 12:49.427
I need you to know

12:49.495 --> 12:51.062
that I am a perfect
gentleman with her,

12:51.130 --> 12:54.031
and honestly I,
I really do care about her.

12:58.336 --> 13:00.370
That is all I wanted to know.

13:00.438 --> 13:01.705
Really?

13:01.773 --> 13:02.539
Mm-hmm.

13:02.607 --> 13:03.774
Ow.

13:03.842 --> 13:04.942
Hey, any word from Beckman

13:05.010 --> 13:06.811
about what's going on
with Sarah?

13:06.878 --> 13:08.478
No, nothing yet.
Still waiting for contact.

13:24.461 --> 13:26.494
Surveillance disabled.

13:27.530 --> 13:29.464
Whoever's in here,

13:29.532 --> 13:31.200
you're about to enter
a world of hurt.

13:33.803 --> 13:37.039
Yeah, serious world of hurt.

13:43.846 --> 13:46.247
Hello, boys.

13:51.486 --> 13:52.486
Honey.

13:52.554 --> 13:54.388
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry
for all the drama,

13:54.456 --> 13:55.823
but nobody can know
that I'm here.

13:55.891 --> 13:57.824
I had to disable
the surveillance.

13:59.126 --> 14:00.327
Wow...

14:00.394 --> 14:01.361
Sarah, you look

14:01.428 --> 14:02.863
evocative.

14:02.930 --> 14:04.497
It's so great to see
all of your faces,

14:04.565 --> 14:06.499
but I don't have much time
before I have to leave.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.434
I'm being sent

14:08.502 --> 14:10.103
to Seabrook Supermax Prison

14:10.171 --> 14:12.805
and I need you to create
a diversion for me.

14:14.174 --> 14:15.607
Sorry.

14:15.675 --> 14:17.776
Sorry, you just, you, you just,
you look so different.

14:18.845 --> 14:20.880
You know, hair change.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.348
That's a big...
it's kind of a drastic...

14:22.415 --> 14:24.449
What do you, how do you,
how do you do that?

14:24.517 --> 14:25.918
Is that a wash or a wig?

14:25.986 --> 14:28.087
Uh, right, I need you

14:28.154 --> 14:30.288
to create a diversion so that
I can break out this man:

14:30.356 --> 14:33.124
Yuri Gobrienko,
aka Yuri the Gobbler.

14:33.192 --> 14:34.959
Yikes, a big mother.

14:35.027 --> 14:36.527
Eh, big doesn't always mean bad.

14:36.595 --> 14:38.562
Here are some photographs
of his victims.

14:38.630 --> 14:41.299
Oh, that's not good.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.067
That's impressive.
The Gobbler is

14:43.135 --> 14:45.802
Volkoff's main bodyguard, but
your mom believes that he has

14:45.870 --> 14:47.404
some connection
to Volkoff's database.

14:47.471 --> 14:48.906
Code name Hydra.

14:50.275 --> 14:51.641
I have to rendezvous
with Volkoff's men.

14:51.709 --> 14:52.642
Find a way into the prison.

14:52.710 --> 14:55.578
I'll meet you inside.

15:03.853 --> 15:10.526
Sarah, Sarah, wait, hey,
I know you gotta go, but...

15:17.133 --> 15:19.734
I missed you, too, Chuck.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.736
Wow.

15:21.804 --> 15:24.572
I... it's kind of, it's kind
of like I'm cheating on you

15:24.640 --> 15:26.942
with you, right now.

15:27.009 --> 15:28.176
Good-bye.

15:28.244 --> 15:30.111
Call me on the secure line
with the plan.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.880
Got it.

15:32.948 --> 15:34.949
See you in prison.

15:47.767 --> 15:48.734
What do we got?

15:48.802 --> 15:50.368
Transfer from Gen Pop.

15:50.436 --> 15:52.204
The inmates are having rec time.

15:52.271 --> 15:54.372
Careful, it's been almost
two days without a stabbing.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.809
We're due.

16:01.815 --> 16:04.916
<i>I was thinking
maybe we should just postpone</i>

16:04.983 --> 16:06.483
this mission just lo e enough

16:06.551 --> 16:08.953
for everyone here to get all the
stabbings out of their systems.

16:09.021 --> 16:10.454
What do you say?
Chuck, listen to me.

16:10.522 --> 16:11.956
That tattoo on your face

16:12.024 --> 16:14.792
belongs to the most ruthless
gang in North America.

16:14.860 --> 16:17.028
Well, you just tap on this
bad boy right here and...

16:17.096 --> 16:19.363
uh, it's instant respect.

16:19.431 --> 16:21.297
What have you done?
Hmm?

16:21.365 --> 16:24.601
Just a little bit
of a, of a smudge.

16:24.668 --> 16:26.502
Focus, guys...
timing's limited.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.304
We can only divert surveillance
for a short period of time.

16:28.372 --> 16:29.439
Yeah, and then when you do,

16:29.506 --> 16:30.774
make sure you signal me
as fast as possible

16:30.842 --> 16:31.875
so I can flash

16:31.943 --> 16:32.976
and neutralize the Gobbler.

16:33.044 --> 16:34.244
You just make sure
he's out cold.

16:34.311 --> 16:35.612
He can't know
Walker had any help

16:35.679 --> 16:36.645
getting him out of here.

16:36.713 --> 16:38.214
Yeah, yeah, no...
good, good, good.

16:38.281 --> 16:39.615
Good old-fashioned prison fight.

16:39.682 --> 16:40.750
I'm excited, you know?

16:40.817 --> 16:41.851
You take out the biggest
and baddest dude

16:41.918 --> 16:44.854
in that place, and
guess who's top dog.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.789
You are, all right?

16:46.857 --> 16:47.990
You look better
without it... tougher.

16:52.728 --> 16:54.362
All right, guys, listen up.

16:54.429 --> 16:56.131
New dude in here.

16:56.198 --> 16:57.766
Don't mean to interrupt
your little game of Mah-jongg,

16:57.833 --> 17:00.034
but we got ourselves
a real killer here today.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.169
Yep.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.873
New guy here likes
to fight other dudes.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.741
I would be very,
very careful of this guy.

17:06.809 --> 17:08.076
Killer.

17:08.144 --> 17:09.277
This is the guy.

17:09.310 --> 17:10.578
This is the guy
you don't want to mess with.

17:10.646 --> 17:11.912
All right, dangerous.

17:11.980 --> 17:14.080
Morgan, I think
they get the point.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.082
They all look

17:15.150 --> 17:16.215
like they want to kill me.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.217
Well,

17:17.286 --> 17:18.551
you're welcome, okay.

17:19.521 --> 17:21.489
As you were, guys.

17:21.556 --> 17:22.589
Carry on.

17:35.303 --> 17:38.237
So...

17:38.306 --> 17:41.573
which one of you is
Yuri the Gobbler?

17:46.713 --> 17:49.948
Please, not so loud.

17:52.485 --> 17:53.419
What's going on here?

17:53.486 --> 17:54.420
What are you doing there?

17:54.487 --> 17:55.788
What's the eye thing all about?

17:55.855 --> 17:58.289
The last time
I pointed at him, he did this.

17:58.357 --> 18:00.090
Swallowed 'em whole.

18:04.162 --> 18:06.764
All right, Bartowski,
Walker arrives in three minutes.

18:06.832 --> 18:08.766
Prepare to initiate the fight.

18:08.834 --> 18:09.834
Oh, boy.

18:09.901 --> 18:11.736
The surveillance room
is just up here.

18:11.804 --> 18:15.405
So, listen, um, Alex, you
know, uh, hypothetically,

18:15.473 --> 18:17.607
very hypothetically,

18:17.675 --> 18:19.343
how do you think that
she would respond

18:19.410 --> 18:21.478
to, let's say, me
saying "I love you"?

18:21.546 --> 18:23.313
Stupid thing to say.
What if I actually mean it?

18:23.381 --> 18:25.315
No, the words are stupid.

18:25.383 --> 18:26.783
You love someone, you show 'em.

18:26.851 --> 18:29.051
Heck, I went to her apartment,
built her a shelf yesterday.

18:29.118 --> 18:30.753
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:30.821 --> 18:34.022
You've never told your daughter
that you love her?

18:34.090 --> 18:35.958
I mean, that just seems wrong.

18:36.025 --> 18:38.327
I didn't ask you
what you think, did I?

18:39.363 --> 18:41.964
You can talk to me.

18:42.031 --> 18:44.599
I know a lot about love.

18:44.667 --> 18:47.935
Yeah, no, totally.

18:50.673 --> 18:52.807
Moving in on the Gobbler now.

18:52.875 --> 18:55.009
The closer you get,

18:55.077 --> 18:56.378
the bigger he gets.

18:56.445 --> 18:58.847
Okay, let's get this guard

18:58.914 --> 19:00.614
off the surveillance
monitors. You ready?

19:00.682 --> 19:01.648
It's the only way, right?

19:01.716 --> 19:03.149
We gotta do what we gotta do.

19:04.586 --> 19:06.520
What's his name again?

19:06.588 --> 19:09.523
Steve.
Oh, yeah, Steve.

19:12.594 --> 19:14.194
Hey.

19:14.262 --> 19:15.996
Who are you guys?

19:16.063 --> 19:17.730
You know, it goes against
everything I believe in

19:17.798 --> 19:19.198
to interfere
with a hard-working guard

19:19.266 --> 19:24.136
protecting American citizens,
but this just has to be done.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.439
Happy birthday, Steve.

19:26.507 --> 19:27.673
I know it's a little late,

19:27.741 --> 19:29.308
but all the guards

19:29.376 --> 19:33.044
down in Gen Pop... we wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

19:34.614 --> 19:36.415

You Yuri the Gobbler?

19:38.183 --> 19:40.752
What do you want?

19:40.820 --> 19:42.287
I want your seat.

19:42.354 --> 19:43.822
It looks comfortable.

19:50.295 --> 19:52.162
You try to make point, huh?

19:52.230 --> 19:55.866
Show everyone that you
can, uh, take me out?

19:55.934 --> 20:00.571

maybe I just want your chair.

chair you got there.

22:41.423 --> 22:42.990
I want it.

22:43.058 --> 22:45.425
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Honestly? Right now?

22:45.493 --> 22:47.727
I can't just be top
dog for a minute?

22:50.764 --> 22:52.599
Get up!

22:59.173 --> 23:00.240
What are you looking at?

23:00.308 --> 23:01.707
Nothing.

23:04.611 --> 23:06.512
Well, looks like
you're top dog now.

23:06.580 --> 23:07.746
What?

23:07.814 --> 23:09.815
It doesn't matter.

23:21.527 --> 23:25.195
Let's go.
Come on.

23:25.263 --> 23:27.397
I love sourdough.

23:31.569 --> 23:34.338
I love you.

23:36.441 --> 23:38.675
Was that weird?
That whole finger kiss thingy?

23:38.743 --> 23:40.209
A little.
But I love you, too.

23:40.277 --> 23:42.778
I hate this, when you leave.

23:42.846 --> 23:45.548
But it's all going
to be over soon.

23:45.616 --> 23:48.317
I hope so.

23:48.385 --> 23:50.919
Of course. Of course it will.

23:50.987 --> 23:52.655
We got the Gobbler.
That's big, right?

23:52.722 --> 23:54.723
It could be, yeah.

23:56.692 --> 23:58.960
Chuck, your mom's been doing
this for many years.

23:59.028 --> 24:00.262
It...

24:00.329 --> 24:03.298
It just could take some time.

24:03.366 --> 24:05.400
♪ ♪

24:06.435 --> 24:07.536
Okay.

24:11.140 --> 24:14.441
I'll let you know what we learn.

24:14.509 --> 24:16.177
Bye.

24:16.244 --> 24:18.646
Bye.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.368
I'm thinking about
a new toaster, babe.

24:39.435 --> 24:41.837
I mean, toaster technology
has come a long way.

24:41.904 --> 24:46.074
Hello. Beautiful friend.

24:46.141 --> 24:49.110
Eleanor.
Uh, can I be of help?

24:49.178 --> 24:51.612
We were just talking
about a new toaster oven.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.180
Toaster oven?
More like bun in the oven.

24:53.248 --> 24:54.348
Right.

24:54.416 --> 24:56.149
Sure.

24:56.217 --> 24:57.418
Any thoughts on names, or...

24:57.486 --> 25:00.120
Actually, we have.
We're naming her Gr.nka.

25:00.188 --> 25:02.322
Gr.nka.
Gr.nka.

25:02.391 --> 25:03.557
Wow.

25:03.625 --> 25:06.693
Wow. I lost my virginity
to a girl named Gr.nka.

25:06.761 --> 25:09.028
Filthy, filthy lady.

25:09.096 --> 25:10.430
Hard to believe
she was a grandmother.

25:10.498 --> 25:11.865
Oh...

25:11.932 --> 25:13.132
That's just gross, babe.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.467
She was gross.

25:14.535 --> 25:15.535
Sticks in the head.

25:15.603 --> 25:17.136
We should really
rethink the name.

25:17.204 --> 25:19.439
Actually, I'm pretty
happy with my choice.

25:19.507 --> 25:21.408
Sorry to interrupt.

25:21.475 --> 25:24.276
Were you guys talking about that
famous Armenian serial killer,

25:24.343 --> 25:25.511
Gr.nka Kassabian?

25:25.578 --> 25:27.279
What?
Serial killer?

25:27.346 --> 25:30.181
Yes. Yes, we were.

25:32.051 --> 25:35.320
Don't think I don't understand
what you're doing here, Devon.

25:35.388 --> 25:38.656
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

25:38.724 --> 25:42.026
Mission accomplished.

25:46.131 --> 25:48.900
Gr.nka, huh?
Love that name.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.735
I haven't even told
you the name yet.

25:50.803 --> 25:54.805
Right. Ask first,
then say my line.

25:54.872 --> 25:56.172
Sorry.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.876
Hi, um... uh, yeah.

25:59.944 --> 26:01.745
Uh, so what are you
naming your baby?

26:10.154 --> 26:12.387
Yuri.

26:12.456 --> 26:13.756
So good to see you.

26:13.824 --> 26:15.724
Mr. Volkoff.

26:15.792 --> 26:16.992
I love working with this man.

26:17.060 --> 26:19.862
We have a long
and storied history.

26:19.930 --> 26:20.930
You know,
when you were captured,

26:20.997 --> 26:22.064
I was at a complete loss.

26:22.131 --> 26:24.366
My safety compromised.

26:24.434 --> 26:26.568
The one and only agent
with complete access

26:26.635 --> 26:27.936
to my Hydra database,

26:28.003 --> 26:30.605
under lock and key.

26:30.673 --> 26:33.107
I am sorry.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.944
Oh, don't apologize.

26:37.179 --> 26:39.681
I'm not angry.

26:39.748 --> 26:42.549
Just disappointed.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.620
Disappointed?

26:46.688 --> 26:49.990
Well, a little disappointed.

26:51.325 --> 26:53.460
No. Very disappointed.

27:05.873 --> 27:08.307
Sorry.

27:08.375 --> 27:10.075
I have a hard time
with disappointment.

27:12.278 --> 27:14.313
It feels weird, coming back

27:14.381 --> 27:16.748
from a mission without Sarah,
doesn't it?

27:16.816 --> 27:18.550
A little bit.

27:18.618 --> 27:20.118
Could just be
indigestion, though.

27:20.185 --> 27:22.086
We ate a lot of cake.

27:22.154 --> 27:25.456
You know, Sarah
and I just, uh...

27:25.525 --> 27:27.191
kind of started this ritual.

27:27.259 --> 27:28.727
After a rough mission,
we'd order a pizza

27:28.794 --> 27:33.230
and play a board game,
just unwind, you know?

27:33.297 --> 27:36.266
I guess that's not gonna happen
for a little while now, is it?

27:39.203 --> 27:41.271
<i>Hey, did-did we record The View?</i>

27:41.339 --> 27:42.339
Oh...

27:42.407 --> 27:44.708
Shoot, I don't know if I...

27:44.776 --> 27:46.476
did that or not.
But, you know, it's funny

27:46.544 --> 27:47.977
that you should mention
the whole board game thing.

27:48.045 --> 27:49.812
'Cause we were just talking
about how we were itching

27:49.880 --> 27:51.748
to-to play
a classic board game.

27:51.815 --> 27:53.082
Weren't we, Casey?

27:53.150 --> 27:55.317
We were.

27:55.385 --> 27:56.485
We were.

27:56.554 --> 27:59.055
So...

27:59.122 --> 28:00.523
Great!

28:00.591 --> 28:02.158
Alexei, what did you do?

28:02.225 --> 28:05.527
He's the only one
who knew about Hydra.

28:05.595 --> 28:09.197
No, Yuri didn't know
about Hydra.

28:09.265 --> 28:11.466
Yuri was Hydra.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.273
Oh...

28:18.340 --> 28:20.374
Just a moment.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.513
Oh! Got it.

28:31.219 --> 28:35.388
I hired Yuri to carry this
device on him at all times.

28:35.456 --> 28:37.657
It cost him an eyeball,

28:37.725 --> 28:40.493
but earned him an unparalleled
place in my corporation.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.869
But Yuri got careless,
got himself captured.

28:49.937 --> 28:54.039
So the Hydra device
had to be extracted.

28:54.107 --> 28:56.875
So this is your database.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.978
Much more than just a database.

28:59.045 --> 29:01.179
This is how I communicate
with my people.

29:01.247 --> 29:03.415
None of them knows each other.

29:03.483 --> 29:06.684
None of them are aware of what
part they play in my puzzle.

29:06.752 --> 29:09.220
Hydra allows me to
see everything.

29:10.789 --> 29:14.926
Hydra is the heart of
Volkoff Industries.

29:14.994 --> 29:17.361
But, the fact that
you're even seeing this

29:17.429 --> 29:19.530
proves that it has a flaw.

29:30.508 --> 29:32.308
Human error.

29:33.577 --> 29:35.846
Yuri's shortcomings
made me realize

29:35.913 --> 29:37.914
what a risk the eye was.

29:37.982 --> 29:40.182
So you just destroyed
the whole system?

29:42.218 --> 29:44.353
Of course not.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.188
I just downloaded all the data

29:46.256 --> 29:47.990
to a more secure
backup location.

29:49.259 --> 29:52.061
Good.
No more complications.

29:52.129 --> 29:53.763
Now, good work, Sarah.

29:53.830 --> 29:55.263
But before I reward you,

29:55.330 --> 29:58.399
there is one small issue that
we still have to take care of.

29:59.501 --> 30:01.736
Come.

30:01.804 --> 30:04.038
The jet's ready to depart.

30:04.105 --> 30:07.041
Actually, no.

30:07.108 --> 30:09.109
There are two issues.

30:09.177 --> 30:12.612
We've got a dead
body on the floor.

30:14.849 --> 30:16.917
Phyllis, cleanup!

30:20.921 --> 30:22.989
World domination never gets old.

30:23.057 --> 30:26.092
Guys, thanks for
keeping my spirits up.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.259
I really appreciate it.

30:27.327 --> 30:29.829
Yeah. Of course.
If there's anything else

30:29.897 --> 30:31.097
you feel like talking
about, feel free.

30:31.165 --> 30:33.032
You know I'm a good listener,
and Casey's...

30:35.334 --> 30:37.736
Casey. Yeah, I get it.

30:37.804 --> 30:39.504
It's hard, you know.
I wish I could

30:39.572 --> 30:41.506
bottle my feelings up
and not be so vulnerable.

30:41.574 --> 30:43.809
Well, maybe you should tell that
to your armies in Australia.

30:43.876 --> 30:46.344
You've got to be kidding me.

30:48.081 --> 30:49.014
Okay.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.185
Who is that? Is it Alex?

30:54.252 --> 30:57.521
'Cause, uh, maybe

30:57.589 --> 30:59.824
if we're all in this
sort of caring mood,

30:59.891 --> 31:01.425
you could send her
a little text that says,

31:01.492 --> 31:02.960
"I love you."

31:03.028 --> 31:04.294
You know, which would be nice
for the both of you.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.262
It's Walker. She needs to meet.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.131
She didn't use the secure line?

31:08.199 --> 31:10.033
Well, okay. Fine
Let's go, then.

31:10.101 --> 31:10.934
No, She said, "Come alone."

31:11.001 --> 31:12.435
Volkoff must be
in the vicinity.

31:12.502 --> 31:13.803
Ca... No, no.
Casey, forget that.

31:13.871 --> 31:15.705
She needs us.
Bartowski,

31:15.773 --> 31:17.941
this is a delicate situation.
Volkoff knows who you are.

31:18.008 --> 31:19.375
You stay put.

31:19.443 --> 31:21.577
Trouble comes up,
I'll be in contact.

31:35.225 --> 31:37.860
When you broke
the Gobbler out of prison,

31:37.927 --> 31:42.797
did you, by any chance,
happen to run into this man?

31:42.865 --> 31:44.632
I was using him.

31:44.699 --> 31:47.268
He's still loyal to me, so why
not take advantage of that?

31:47.335 --> 31:48.836
Good answer.

31:48.904 --> 31:50.704
Now, let's prove that it's true.

31:50.773 --> 31:52.706
I took the liberty of posing

31:52.775 --> 31:55.108
as you and summoning him here.

31:56.778 --> 31:59.712
All I want you to do
is go up to the ninth floor,

31:59.781 --> 32:02.015
and kill John Casey.

32:06.988 --> 32:09.256
Frost will go with you to make
sure it all happens correctly.

32:11.724 --> 32:13.325
Oh! By the way!

32:13.393 --> 32:14.927
I'll be watching.

32:16.763 --> 32:19.364
So let's make it exciting.

32:19.432 --> 32:21.633
Have fun with it.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.129
How the hell am I supposed
to make this look real?

32:37.196 --> 32:38.363
I don't know.

32:38.431 --> 32:40.766
But if you find a way,
give him this.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.101
I will.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.302
Buy me some time if
Volkoff comes up here.

32:59.084 --> 33:00.684
Buddy, I can't take it anymore.

33:00.752 --> 33:01.952
I got to figure out

33:02.020 --> 33:03.253
where Casey is meeting Sarah.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.555
Dude, I know you miss
your girl, believe me,

33:05.623 --> 33:07.924
but Casey said that
we had to stay put.

33:07.992 --> 33:09.092
No. No, Morgan.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.927
This is not
about me missing her, okay?

33:10.995 --> 33:13.463
What if they're in danger?
What if they need the Intersect?

33:13.531 --> 33:15.298
I'm going to Castle.
Maybe I can hack

33:15.366 --> 33:17.967
into Casey's phone.

33:18.035 --> 33:20.169
Trident Tower, ninth floor.

33:20.236 --> 33:21.837
What?

33:21.905 --> 33:24.406
Trident Tower, ninth floor...
that's where they're going.

33:24.474 --> 33:26.475
I happen to be really good at
the quick-look-at-your-phone

33:26.543 --> 33:28.544
when-you-get-a-text-but
you-didn't-know-I-looked look.

33:28.611 --> 33:31.080
You're angry at me
because I withheld information.

33:31.148 --> 33:33.447
I get it, but, dude, I...

33:33.515 --> 33:35.650
I thought
I did it for your own good.

33:35.718 --> 33:37.686
And, by the way,
I didn't even...

33:37.753 --> 33:39.921
know that you were gone,
so-so that's interesting.

33:39.989 --> 33:42.657
I'm just pretty much here
talking to myself.

33:42.725 --> 33:44.726
My turn.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.561
What you doing,
Walker? Hmm?

34:26.699 --> 34:28.199
That a girl.

34:31.036 --> 34:32.137
What are you doing?

34:32.205 --> 34:33.404
I'm supposed to kill you.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.672
Volkoff is watching.

34:34.741 --> 34:35.540
Look.

34:37.408 --> 34:39.610
Good. Now follow my lead.

34:45.617 --> 34:46.717
General, something's up.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.351
There are guards
in front of the building.

34:48.418 --> 34:49.786
Casey was contacted
off the secure line.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.123
I'll call you
when I have eyes on him.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.562
Chuck, you're just in time.

34:59.630 --> 35:02.465
Just in time for what?

35:02.532 --> 35:06.770
There's a particular moment

35:06.837 --> 35:10.405
when an agent makes the decision
to stop pretending,

35:10.473 --> 35:12.875
and to take the leap
to join the other side.

35:12.942 --> 35:16.544
It's a
game-changing step.

35:16.612 --> 35:18.847
Your mother made it
all those years ago.

35:18.915 --> 35:22.417
And now, if you'll
come with me,

35:22.485 --> 35:25.887
we'll see if Sarah's going
to make the same step.

35:27.055 --> 35:29.757
I think she will.
Come on.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.230
I can't leave here
without killing you.

35:36.298 --> 35:37.231
How do we sell this?

35:37.299 --> 35:38.632
Duck.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.168
Oh! I'll let you retrieve
your weapon, you shoot me

35:41.235 --> 35:42.402
in the shoulder.

35:42.469 --> 35:43.670
I'm not going to shoot you.

35:44.705 --> 35:46.139
Look who I found!

35:46.207 --> 35:47.908
Chuck!

35:47.975 --> 35:49.475
What are you doing here?

35:49.543 --> 35:53.113
Well, I thought we had a truce,
but I like a little rascal

35:53.181 --> 35:54.514
who doesn't always listen.

35:54.581 --> 35:55.748
Truce, huh?

35:55.817 --> 35:57.149
You have an interesting way

35:57.217 --> 35:59.285
of keeping your end
of the bargain, Alexei.

36:01.021 --> 36:01.921
Okay, then.

36:02.889 --> 36:04.356
Throw me out the window.

36:04.424 --> 36:05.857
What?!

36:05.925 --> 36:07.025
The window.

36:08.260 --> 36:10.328
Look, there's a little
platform down there.

36:10.395 --> 36:11.629
It's only 40 feet.

36:11.697 --> 36:12.864
I've done 60, easy.

36:15.734 --> 36:17.668
I'll be fine, I promise.
Okay. But you better be fine,

36:17.736 --> 36:18.769
or else I'll really kill you.

36:18.838 --> 36:20.671
Okay.

36:20.739 --> 36:22.306
I'm here to find Casey.
Where is he?

36:22.373 --> 36:24.842
I'll show you.

36:25.844 --> 36:27.211
When you get back to Castle,

36:27.278 --> 36:28.145
give this to Chuck.

36:28.213 --> 36:29.512
Huh?

36:29.580 --> 36:30.747
Okay?

36:34.552 --> 36:36.019
Quite a brawl.

36:39.756 --> 36:40.990
Sarah?

36:41.058 --> 36:42.225
I notice your
gun's gone missing.

36:42.292 --> 36:43.359
You want me to finish him?

36:43.426 --> 36:44.227
No.

36:49.766 --> 36:51.767
Kill him, Agent Walker.

36:52.869 --> 36:56.238
Is that all you got? Huh?

37:06.648 --> 37:07.382
No!

37:07.449 --> 37:08.583
No, Casey!

37:08.650 --> 37:10.050
No!

37:19.928 --> 37:21.061
Whoa!

37:40.260 --> 37:41.695
It's done.

37:41.762 --> 37:43.161
Why...?

37:43.229 --> 37:45.397
Why?

37:45.465 --> 37:46.866
Why?

37:46.933 --> 37:49.234
Don't you see, Charles?

37:49.302 --> 37:50.870
She did this all for you.

37:50.937 --> 37:53.639
Bit of paternal advice.

37:53.707 --> 37:55.541
You might want to give
her a little bit of space.

37:55.609 --> 37:58.643
Taking a leap like this
is painful for all involved.

37:58.711 --> 38:01.846
But congratulations.

38:01.914 --> 38:03.715
You're one step closer

38:03.782 --> 38:05.717
to the woman you love.

38:07.987 --> 38:10.321
Chuck...

38:10.389 --> 38:11.656
Chuck?

38:11.724 --> 38:13.791
You ready to go?

38:17.662 --> 38:19.796
I'm ready.

38:23.467 --> 38:25.468
Good.

38:35.946 --> 38:38.748
I'm sorry.

38:38.815 --> 38:42.885
Maybe involving Chuck's cronies
wasn't the best idea.

38:42.953 --> 38:44.219
Okay, it was the worst idea.

38:44.287 --> 38:45.555
Look, not

38:45.622 --> 38:48.489
having the baby named
is making me a little anxious,

38:48.558 --> 38:50.959
and I understand
if you don't like that name,

38:51.027 --> 38:53.028
but you haven't liked any name.

38:53.095 --> 38:55.430
What?! I've liked names.

38:55.497 --> 38:56.598
Like what?

38:56.666 --> 38:58.332
Like, um...

38:58.400 --> 38:59.801
Like Clara.

38:59.869 --> 39:02.136
Well, I like Clara.

39:02.204 --> 39:04.205
Really?

39:04.273 --> 39:05.073
Yeah.

39:05.140 --> 39:06.474
Clara.

39:06.542 --> 39:07.641
Is that her name?

39:07.709 --> 39:08.809
I mean,

39:08.877 --> 39:10.144
this is a huge decision.

39:10.212 --> 39:12.980
One that'll set her path
the rest of her life.

39:13.048 --> 39:16.150
Devon, we are gonna have to make
a million decisions like this.

39:16.218 --> 39:17.351
This is called being a parent.

39:17.419 --> 39:18.919
I know, but this is
the first one.

39:18.987 --> 39:21.455
I think I've been stalling just
because I want to get it right.

39:21.522 --> 39:25.992
Okay, I'll make it easy
for you... Clara or Gr.nka?

39:26.060 --> 39:27.727
Clara it is!

39:30.198 --> 39:32.199
Little Clara Woodcomb.

39:33.401 --> 39:35.234
I can't believe you thought

39:35.302 --> 39:37.069
I was gonna name
our baby Gr.nka.

39:37.137 --> 39:40.172
Gr.nka... the name of the
spoons that I bought at Ikea.

39:41.674 --> 39:43.976
I had you going there
for a minute, though.

39:44.043 --> 39:45.944
Spoons?
Mm-hmm.

39:46.012 --> 39:47.813
From Ikea?
That's right.
