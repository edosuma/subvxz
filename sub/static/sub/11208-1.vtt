00:34.120 --> 00:35.080
Hell.

00:35.210 --> 00:36.290
We're moving out.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.580
Got a fire?

00:37.630 --> 00:39.210
Too early in the morning.

00:40.960 --> 00:42.340
All right.

00:53.230 --> 00:55.230
Get out of there. Come on.

03:15.040 --> 03:16.380
Come here.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.720
I'm fixing you up with a job...

03:25.970 --> 03:27.550
with your uncle.

03:28.890 --> 03:31.470
Work now, till you go back to college.

03:32.850 --> 03:36.310
If your face gets any longer
here, you'll overbalance...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.240
or I'll commit suicide.

03:48.490 --> 03:49.740
Bilquis?

03:51.040 --> 03:52.120
Good.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.620
And Tania and the other girls?

03:58.460 --> 03:59.670
I say...

04:00.210 --> 04:04.260
can't you give Omar some work
in your garage for a few weeks?

04:06.640 --> 04:07.680
Come on, yaar.

04:07.760 --> 04:10.270
The bugger is your nephew, after all.

04:12.180 --> 04:13.690
He's on dole...

04:14.440 --> 04:16.649
like everyone else in England.

04:18.519 --> 04:21.320
He sweeps the dust from
one place to another...

04:21.360 --> 04:22.990
he squeezes shirts...

04:23.070 --> 04:24.740
and he heats soup.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.280
I mean, that hardly stretches him.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.580
His food stretches me.

04:30.450 --> 04:34.000
Oh, come on, yaar. I'll send
him to college in the autumn.

04:34.330 --> 04:38.090
One thing more, try and
fix him up with a nice girl.

04:38.380 --> 04:41.460
I'm not sure his penis
is in full working order.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.190
We've got one parking space.

04:59.270 --> 05:00.650
?5 a week.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.490
And from this afternoon...

05:07.780 --> 05:10.660
we're offering a special
on-the-premises...

05:10.990 --> 05:12.370
clean-the-car
service.

05:12.405 --> 05:13.710
New thing.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.670
Is that your car?

05:22.010 --> 05:24.720
Why you feeling it up, then? Come here.

05:25.260 --> 05:26.720
Here, I said.

05:34.060 --> 05:36.610
This bastard who almost
beat you up is Salim.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.070
You'll be seeing a lot of him.

05:38.110 --> 05:40.320
I've heard many great
things about your father.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.570
I must see him, but where is the time?

05:42.650 --> 05:47.200
You're too busy keeping this damn country
in the black. Still, someone's got to do it.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.870
So, your papa got thrown out of
that clerk's job I fixed him with?

05:51.120 --> 05:52.620
Pissed, was he?

05:54.000 --> 05:55.750
Can you wash a car?

05:55.960 --> 05:58.130
Have you washed a car before?

05:58.630 --> 06:00.590
Your uncle can't pay you very much...

06:00.670 --> 06:03.220
but at least you'll be able
to afford a decent shirt...

06:03.300 --> 06:06.600
and you'll be with your own
people, not in the dole queue.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.390
Mrs. Thatcher will be happy with me.

06:14.480 --> 06:16.440
It's easy to wash a car.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.690
You just wet a rag and rub.

06:19.690 --> 06:21.990
You know how to rub, don't you?

06:22.820 --> 06:23.450
Do this one first.

06:24.070 --> 06:25.360
Carefully...

06:25.450 --> 06:28.490
as if you were restoring
a Renaissance painting.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.410
It's my car.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.750
- Hi, baby.
- My love.

06:45.840 --> 06:46.930
Here.

07:00.650 --> 07:03.070
What do you think I am, your trampoline?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.280
Speak my language, damn it.

07:09.370 --> 07:11.540
I'll do nothing else, Nasser.

07:13.540 --> 07:16.330
- Do you think we'll ever part?
- Not at the moment.

07:16.380 --> 07:17.790
I'm serious.

07:20.050 --> 07:21.670
Just keep moving.

07:22.670 --> 07:24.340
Just there.

07:24.380 --> 07:25.800
I love you.

07:26.220 --> 07:27.470
Darling.

07:27.550 --> 07:30.010
Christ, you move like a niner.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.310
I love you, too. Can
we go away somewhere?

07:32.390 --> 07:34.480
- Yes, I'm taking you.
- Where?

07:34.560 --> 07:38.230
- Campton Park. Saturday.
- Really? Great. Can we take the boy?

07:38.570 --> 07:42.490
- I've got big plans for the boy.
- You aren't gonna make him work.

07:51.950 --> 07:54.210
By the way, Rachel is my old friend.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.420
Hello.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.080
How's Auntie Bilquis?

07:57.170 --> 07:58.540
At home with the kids.

07:58.590 --> 08:01.170
Papa sends his love.
Uncle, if I pick Papa up...

08:01.210 --> 08:04.300
Have you ever been to a
high-class place like this before?

08:04.380 --> 08:07.680
I suppose you spend most of the
time in your black-hole flat.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.430
- Lf I pick Papa up, Uncle...
- He is one of those underprivileged types.

08:11.520 --> 08:14.770
...and squeezed him,
squeezed Papa out like that...

08:14.805 --> 08:16.150
I often imagine I'd get...

08:16.230 --> 08:17.690
Two fat slaps.

08:17.770 --> 08:21.030
Two bottles of pure vodka
and a kind of flap of skin.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.530
Like a French letter.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.450
What are you talking, madman?

08:24.530 --> 08:26.625
I love my brother like I love you.

08:26.660 --> 08:30.160
- I don't understand how you can love me.
- Because you're such a prick.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.910
You can't be sure that I am.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.159
Nasser.

08:33.250 --> 08:34.750
She's right.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.250
Don't deliberately
make me laugh at you...

08:37.340 --> 08:40.090
when I've brought you here to
tell you one essential thing.

08:40.169 --> 08:42.090
Now, move closer.

08:44.220 --> 08:45.510
Get up.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.230
In this damn country,
which we hate and love...

08:52.180 --> 08:54.230
you can get anything you want.

08:54.650 --> 08:56.730
It's all spread out and available.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.150
That's why I believe in England.

09:00.150 --> 09:03.860
Only you have to know how to
squeeze the tits of the system.

09:05.490 --> 09:08.120
He's saying that he wants to help you.

09:08.155 --> 09:10.160
What do you want to do with me?

09:10.250 --> 09:12.330
What am I going to do with you?

09:12.830 --> 09:15.130
Turn you into something damn good.

09:15.830 --> 09:18.420
Your father can't do it, can he?

09:22.920 --> 09:24.930
Here, damn fool.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.260
Take it.

09:28.050 --> 09:29.720
You're like a son to me.

09:29.755 --> 09:31.270
To both of us.

09:46.530 --> 09:48.030
Like the work?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.290
Come on, for Christ's sake.

09:52.910 --> 09:54.920
Help me with my accounts.

10:22.400 --> 10:23.820
Kiss Rachel.

10:36.920 --> 10:39.210
I said give her a kiss, not a shower.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.090
- I'll finish your paperwork tonight, Uncle.
- Such a good worker.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.880
- I'm going to promote him.
- What to?

10:44.970 --> 10:47.220
You come to my house next
week, and I'll tell you.

10:47.300 --> 10:50.270
- It's a long way. How will he get there?
- I'll give him a car. That one there.

10:50.305 --> 10:52.890
The keys are in the
office. Anything he wants.

10:53.940 --> 10:56.860
I've got a real challenge
lined up for him.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.730
You must be getting married.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.770
Why else do you dress like
an undertaker on holiday?

11:36.860 --> 11:38.610
I'm going to Uncle's house, Papa.

11:38.690 --> 11:39.940
He's given me a car.

11:40.030 --> 11:41.900
Brakes must be faulty.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.450
Tell me one thing...

11:44.990 --> 11:48.545
'cause this is something I don't
understand. It must be my fault.

11:48.580 --> 11:53.210
How is it that scrubbing cars could
make a son of mine look so ecstatic?

11:53.830 --> 11:55.920
It gets me out of the house.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.510
Don't get too involved with that crook.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.880
You've got to go to college.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.950
This is my nephew, Omar.

12:31.370 --> 12:32.920
Auntie Fasia.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.500
Auntie Farida.

12:40.630 --> 12:42.090
Auntie Salma.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.180
And this is Cherry, Salim's wife.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.520
Of course you remember our
three naughty daughters.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.650
He has his family's cheekbones, Bilquis.

12:57.730 --> 12:59.530
I know all your gorgeous
family in Karachi.

12:59.565 --> 13:00.820
You've been there?

13:01.150 --> 13:02.530
You stupid.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.490
What a stupid.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.370
It's my home.

13:06.450 --> 13:08.330
How could anyone in their right mind...

13:08.410 --> 13:11.080
call this silly little
island off Europe their home?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.250
Every day in Karachi...

13:14.330 --> 13:16.710
your other uncles and
cousins come to our house...

13:16.790 --> 13:19.090
for bridge, booze and VCR.

13:19.420 --> 13:23.220
Cherry, my little nephew knows
nothing about that life there.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.720
God, I'm sick of hearing
about these in-betweens.

13:26.850 --> 13:30.010
People should make up
their minds where they are.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.060
Your uncle's next door.

13:42.700 --> 13:44.360
Can you see me later?

13:44.450 --> 13:46.490
I'm so bored with these people.

13:46.580 --> 13:48.200
Games room, okay?

14:01.590 --> 14:04.050
I presume my brother, the boy's papa...

14:04.130 --> 14:06.680
was out screwing some
barmaid, somewhere.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.430
So, when these damn things went on...

14:09.720 --> 14:12.730
I got out of bed, went to the
balcony and opened the door.

14:12.770 --> 14:17.230
And there was my brother,
standing outside with some woman...

14:18.570 --> 14:21.570
and they were completely
without clothes.

14:23.570 --> 14:26.820
Blue with cold, like two bars of soap.

14:28.370 --> 14:31.500
This I refer to as my
brother's blue period.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.500
- But what happened to the woman?
- He married her.

14:37.420 --> 14:39.130
Come along.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.100
Your father is a good man.

14:46.140 --> 14:48.310
So this is the famous Hussein's son.

14:48.390 --> 14:50.060
The exact bastard.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.770
My blue brother was also a
famous journalist in Bombay.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.600
And a great drinker.

14:55.690 --> 14:59.360
He was to the bottle what Louis
Armstrong is to the trumpet.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.200
But you are to the bookies what
Mother Teresa is to the children.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.320
Your brother was a clever one.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.620
You used to carry his typewriter.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.240
Isn't he coming tonight?

15:10.330 --> 15:12.700
- What ever happened to him?
- Papa's lying down.

15:12.790 --> 15:15.500
- I meant his career.
- That's lying down, also.

15:15.830 --> 15:19.050
What chance would an Englishman give
a leftist, communist Pakistani...

15:19.130 --> 15:21.510
- on newspapers?
- Socialist.

15:26.090 --> 15:30.390
What chance would an Englishman
give a leftist, communist socialist?

15:30.810 --> 15:34.310
What chance a racist
Englishman has given us...

15:34.730 --> 15:38.020
that we haven't taken it
from him with our hands?

15:38.770 --> 15:40.530
Best phrased, yaar?

15:41.570 --> 15:45.530
Zaki, you need a stiff
drink, man, that good port.

15:45.610 --> 15:47.870
Nasser, please, God.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.450
I'm on the verge already.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.540
Can I make you a drink?

15:54.420 --> 15:56.170
Make him a man first.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.630
Give him a drink, Zaki. I like him.

15:59.380 --> 16:01.010
He's our future.

16:16.730 --> 16:18.360
It's been years.

16:18.730 --> 16:21.190
And you're looking really good now.

16:21.820 --> 16:24.160
I think we understand each other.

16:30.620 --> 16:34.170
Were they being cruel to you
in their typical men's way?

16:34.630 --> 16:36.000
You don't mind?

16:36.090 --> 16:38.420
I think I should harden myself.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.010
Wow. What are you into?

16:46.430 --> 16:48.430
Your father's done well.

16:49.060 --> 16:50.270
Has he?

17:02.780 --> 17:04.240
He adores you.

17:05.950 --> 17:09.119
I expect he wants you to
take over the businesses.

17:09.790 --> 17:12.040
He wouldn't think of asking me.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.880
But he is too vicious
to people in his work.

17:18.670 --> 17:22.170
He doesn't want you to take over
that shitty launderette, does he?

17:22.260 --> 17:23.970
What's wrong with it?

17:24.050 --> 17:26.220
And he has a mistress, doesn't he?

17:26.300 --> 17:27.599
Rachel.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.140
Yes.

17:29.180 --> 17:30.390
I can tell from your face.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.730
Does he love her?

17:31.810 --> 17:32.890
Yes.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.780
Please, Tania, can you come and help me?

17:41.440 --> 17:42.990
Families.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.820
I hate families.

17:54.670 --> 17:56.290
Take care of him.

17:57.960 --> 17:59.380
Good night, Uncle.

17:59.550 --> 18:02.220
Take my advice. There's money in muck.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.720
What is it that the gora
Englishman always needs?

18:07.350 --> 18:08.850
Clean clothes.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.060
Go on.

18:12.060 --> 18:13.770
Pick it up.

18:16.690 --> 18:18.150
Drive us back, will you?

18:18.190 --> 18:22.030
You can pick your own car up tomorrow.
Salim's not feeling very well.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.330
Hello, darling.

19:10.790 --> 19:13.620
Fucking nice, man, I want to see it!

19:16.920 --> 19:18.750
Get off the car, will you?

19:19.590 --> 19:21.420
Get off the fucking car!

19:54.790 --> 19:56.000
It's me.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.010
I know who it is.

20:05.890 --> 20:08.300
How are you? All right? Working?

20:09.180 --> 20:11.310
What are you doing now?

20:12.020 --> 20:13.600
This kind of thing.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.405
Omar, come back! Come...

20:16.440 --> 20:18.610
What are you now, a chauffeur?

20:18.730 --> 20:20.650
No, I'm onto something.

20:24.450 --> 20:25.490
What?

20:25.570 --> 20:27.240
I'll let you know.

20:27.490 --> 20:28.530
Still living at the same place?

20:28.620 --> 20:31.750
No, I don't get on with my mom and dad.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.250
You?

20:34.120 --> 20:36.105
She died last year, my mother.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.090
Jumped onto the railway lines.

20:40.710 --> 20:42.220
I heard.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.760
All the trains stopped.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.640
I'm still there.

20:51.310 --> 20:52.810
Got my number?

20:56.440 --> 20:58.020
Like my friends?

20:59.820 --> 21:01.280
Ring us, then.

21:02.650 --> 21:03.990
I will.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.420
Leave them there.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.590
We can do something now.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.250
Just us.

21:20.710 --> 21:21.840
Can't.

21:51.290 --> 21:53.040
What are you doing?

21:53.750 --> 21:55.170
I want to pee.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.380
Can't you wait for me to take you?

21:59.420 --> 22:02.840
My tool will drop off before
you show up, these days.

22:04.010 --> 22:06.090
You know who I met? Johnny.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.390
The boy who came here dressed as a
fascist with a quarter-inch of hair?

22:11.770 --> 22:14.480
He was a friend once, for years.

22:18.110 --> 22:21.900
There were times when he didn't
deserve your admiration so much.

22:23.150 --> 22:25.910
Christ, I've known him since I was 5.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.240
He went too far.

22:36.790 --> 22:38.800
They hate us in England.

22:39.460 --> 22:42.970
And all you can do is
to kiss their asses.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.010
Think of yourself as a little Britisher.

22:50.310 --> 22:52.140
I'm being promoted...

22:53.770 --> 22:55.650
to Uncle's launderette.

23:04.950 --> 23:07.280
Illustrate your washing methods.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.940
It's nothing but a
toilet and a youth club.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.440
A constant boil on my bum.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.820
How's your foot?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.860
Is it? Good.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.700
Do you fancy coming for a walk?

23:52.250 --> 23:54.710
- Where did you get those?
- Church.

23:58.550 --> 24:02.010
You little bastard. That's
how machines get buggered.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.090
What?

24:05.590 --> 24:07.680
I'll come round then, shall I?

24:08.560 --> 24:10.890
All right, see you in a minute.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.480
All right, get started.

24:17.570 --> 24:21.200
- You have the broom, move it.
- I don't only want to sweep up.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.860
What are you, Labor Party?

24:22.950 --> 24:26.030
I want to be manager of this
place. I think I can do it.

24:26.410 --> 24:27.950
Please let me.

24:28.870 --> 24:32.040
Here I was thinking how
to tell your father...

24:32.120 --> 24:35.330
how four punks nearly drowned
you in a washing machine.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.090
On the other hand, a little water on
the brain might clear your thoughts.

24:38.125 --> 24:40.550
Okay, I'll charge you basic rent.

24:40.970 --> 24:42.930
Above that, you keep.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.720
You're everything to me.

24:49.100 --> 24:51.520
Of course I prefer you to Jenny.

25:33.690 --> 25:34.690
Get up.

25:34.770 --> 25:36.270
Please, Salim.

25:36.310 --> 25:40.860
I don't know how to make this place work.
I'm afraid I've made a fool of myself.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.200
Never make a penny here. Your
uncle's given you a dead duck.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.870
That's why I've decided
to help you, financially.

25:47.830 --> 25:51.790
Go to this address near the airport.
Pick up some videocassettes...

25:51.830 --> 25:54.580
and bring them straight back to my flat.

25:54.790 --> 25:56.170
That's all.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.660
Go and sit down.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.670
- You're okay? No problems?
- No.

26:48.390 --> 26:51.810
It's one of the best collections
of modern Indian paintings, Omar.

26:51.890 --> 26:53.900
I patronize many painters.

27:09.580 --> 27:10.960
Right.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.330
I won't be a minute.

27:16.420 --> 27:18.460
Make yourself comfortable.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.970
Watch something, if you like.

27:21.050 --> 27:22.800
You're one of us now.

27:58.500 --> 28:01.170
Hello, can I speak to Johnny, please?

28:02.800 --> 28:05.430
Right. Do you know where he's staying?

28:06.930 --> 28:08.310
Are you sure?

28:08.930 --> 28:11.480
No, I just wanted to help him.

28:11.770 --> 28:13.730
If you see him...

28:13.810 --> 28:15.650
ask him to ring Omo.

28:26.450 --> 28:27.625
Is that the tape playing?

28:27.660 --> 28:30.040
- What the hell are you doing?
- Watching something.

28:30.120 --> 28:32.710
Not these. Who gave you
permission to touch these?

28:32.790 --> 28:35.380
It's just a tape. What are you doing?

28:36.340 --> 28:37.840
What business?

28:44.840 --> 28:47.220
Nasser tells me you're ambitious.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.680
But you failed your exams twice.

28:49.810 --> 28:54.190
You've done nothing with the launderette,
and now you're trying to screw me up.

28:54.850 --> 28:58.070
Become like those white
assholes that call us "wog"?

28:58.610 --> 29:02.740
Your family, rich and powerful
back home, has been let down by you.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.830
Go on, fuck off.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.590
Have you seen Johnny?

29:25.930 --> 29:28.510
Piss off back to the jungle, wog-boy.

29:41.780 --> 29:44.780
These people, they're too tough for you.

29:46.580 --> 29:49.410
I'll tell Nasser you're
through with them.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.040
Hello?

29:53.670 --> 29:55.590
Why did you do that?

29:56.790 --> 29:58.300
Useless fool.

30:04.050 --> 30:05.850
- Hello?
- Now look!

30:06.050 --> 30:07.930
- What?
- Bloody ass.

30:07.970 --> 30:11.100
- What?
- You've amputated my entire fucking foot!

30:13.520 --> 30:15.820
Didn't I say you
should've been a doctor?

30:16.940 --> 30:18.690
- Hello?
- Typical, you know that?

30:18.780 --> 30:19.740
Johnny.

30:20.780 --> 30:23.410
See you later, Johnny-boy.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.990
I'll throw you out of this flat...

30:26.080 --> 30:29.750
if you ever bring that
bum-liability friend of yours here.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.130
I'm dead impressed by all this.

30:44.350 --> 30:47.430
You were the one at
school, the one I liked.

30:48.140 --> 30:50.020
All the Pakis like me.

30:50.430 --> 30:53.650
I've been through all that,
with my parents and that...

30:53.690 --> 30:55.650
and with people like you.

30:56.570 --> 30:59.320
But now there's some pretty
big things I've got in mind.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.740
I need to raise money
to make this place good.

31:03.160 --> 31:05.370
And I want you to help me with that.

31:05.740 --> 31:08.080
I want you to work here with me.

31:10.370 --> 31:12.210
What kind of work is it?

31:12.290 --> 31:13.540
A variety.

31:14.580 --> 31:16.630
Variety of menial things.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.050
Cleaning windows kind of thing?

31:20.130 --> 31:21.475
Sure.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.680
And you can start by
cleaning those bastards out.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.140
Now?

31:26.390 --> 31:28.470
I want everything done now.

31:28.850 --> 31:32.100
That's the only attitude, if
you want to do anything big.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.430
Christ.

32:07.510 --> 32:10.020
Sorry, what happened before.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.770
Too much to drink.

32:13.230 --> 32:16.400
Just go on another little
errand for me. Same as before.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.530
For?0.

32:20.110 --> 32:21.860
You little bastard.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.410
All right.

33:08.950 --> 33:10.200
Come on.

33:12.500 --> 33:15.920
I saw Salim's game. This is
going to finance our whole future.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.460
Cut him out.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.420
You know where to sell this stuff?

33:21.880 --> 33:23.130
Don't you?

33:23.180 --> 33:26.640
I wouldn't be working for you now
if I wanted to go on being a bad boy.

33:26.680 --> 33:28.260
This means more.

33:28.430 --> 33:30.390
Real work. Expansion.

33:30.930 --> 33:32.440
Salim will kill us.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.690
We'll resell it fast, tonight.

33:35.310 --> 33:38.440
Come on. I couldn't be doing
any of this without you.

33:45.990 --> 33:47.490
Do you want some red?

34:13.980 --> 34:16.070
Will you excuse me a moment?

34:16.270 --> 34:18.320
Let's have a private chat.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.410
You can go.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.910
You haven't paid me.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.830
I'm not in the mood.

35:15.670 --> 35:18.420
Nothing happened to you on the way here?

35:18.455 --> 35:19.460
No.

35:22.390 --> 35:24.890
Something may happen
to you on the way back.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.460
She's nice.

36:48.180 --> 36:48.680
Gosh.

36:51.020 --> 36:54.360
Tell me a about the beach
in Bombay, Uncle. Juhu Beach.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.360
Or the house in Lahore...

36:56.440 --> 36:59.610
when Auntie Nina put the garden
hose in Father's bedroom window...

36:59.690 --> 37:03.570
'cause he wouldn't get out of bed,
and Papa's bed started to float.

37:11.540 --> 37:13.250
You look beautiful.

37:13.710 --> 37:15.670
What about my launderette?

37:16.000 --> 37:19.090
Damn these stories about
places you've never been to.

37:19.170 --> 37:22.010
- What are you doing, boy?
- What am I doing?

37:23.260 --> 37:27.100
It’ll be going into profit any day now,
partly because I've hired a bloke...

37:27.180 --> 37:30.890
of astounding competence and
strength of body and mind...

37:30.980 --> 37:32.980
to look after it with me.

37:37.150 --> 37:39.360
Yasmeen, fiddle with my toes.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.700
What bloke?

37:43.780 --> 37:45.530
He's called Johnny.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.910
And how are you going to pay him?

37:48.460 --> 37:49.920
Nasser, sahab.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.340
Zaki!

37:53.960 --> 37:56.050
Everything is good.

37:56.510 --> 37:57.510
But...

38:03.050 --> 38:06.770
- Speak in English, so he can understand.
- Doesn't he understand his language?

38:06.810 --> 38:10.140
Not only that, I've given him that
pain-in-the-ass launderette to run.

38:10.230 --> 38:11.390
I know.

38:11.810 --> 38:15.980
But this is the point. He's
hired someone else to do the work.

38:16.780 --> 38:19.610
Typically English, if I can say that.

38:20.110 --> 38:22.820
You haven't fucked your
uncle's launderette, little fool?

38:22.910 --> 38:25.330
I don't think you should
talk to him like that.

38:25.410 --> 38:28.200
- Why, is he royalty?
- No. I don't like it.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.750
She's a hot girl.

38:31.920 --> 38:35.170
In my small opinion, much
good can come of fucking.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.470
Your mouth has become very big lately.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.050
Well?

38:42.970 --> 38:44.220
All right.

38:44.470 --> 38:46.390
Let's all take it easy.

38:49.310 --> 38:52.190
Who is that sitting in the
drive? It's bothering me.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.270
Some friend of yours?

38:55.310 --> 38:58.280
- Zaki, please go and see who it is.
- It's only Johnny.

38:59.150 --> 39:01.280
My friend. He works for me.

39:01.780 --> 39:04.280
No one works without my permission.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.330
Tania, bring him in.

39:18.960 --> 39:22.380
How much good would come of
us fucking, later tonight?

39:22.510 --> 39:24.550
I know why you put up with them.

39:24.850 --> 39:28.720
'Cause there's so much you want.
You're greedy, like my father.

39:28.810 --> 39:30.440
He's a great man.

39:36.690 --> 39:38.690
Why did you leave him sitting out here?

39:38.780 --> 39:40.900
He's lower class. He won't
come in without being asked.

39:40.935 --> 39:42.870
Unless he's doing a burglary.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.830
My father wants to see you.

39:45.780 --> 39:48.660
- How's Salim today?
- Wearing too much perfume.

39:50.830 --> 39:52.120
Eyelash.

39:59.130 --> 40:02.930
I said to Miss Street, "I'm
the law. I create the world. "

40:04.140 --> 40:06.180
Tania, please.

40:08.980 --> 40:10.810
- You like Tania?
- Yeah.

40:10.890 --> 40:12.520
I'll see what I can do.

40:12.980 --> 40:14.900
And now on to business.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.150
I've been to see the launderette.

40:17.320 --> 40:20.030
You boys will make a
beautiful job of it, I know.

40:20.070 --> 40:22.200
You need nothing more there.

40:22.410 --> 40:24.070
But in exchange...

40:24.820 --> 40:26.910
I want you to do something.

40:27.660 --> 40:29.330
You look like a tough chap.

40:29.410 --> 40:33.790
I've got some bastard tenants in one
of my houses that I cannot get rid of.

40:33.825 --> 40:36.630
No. I don't do nothing rough no more.

40:37.630 --> 40:41.010
I'm not looking for a mass
murderer, you bloody fool.

40:41.590 --> 40:44.430
- What does it involve, please?
- Unscrewing.

40:45.180 --> 40:47.390
Your favorite subject, Salim.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.270
For Christ's sake.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.480
What's this "unscrewing"?

40:52.690 --> 40:55.900
You're getting into some
family business, that's all.

40:55.940 --> 40:59.440
What the hell else is there
left for you in this country now?

41:00.070 --> 41:04.280
Send him to the garage and call
Tania. Ask her to bring some champagne.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.620
We'll drink to Thatcher and
your beautiful launderette.

41:07.740 --> 41:10.750
- Do they go together?
- Like dal and chapattis.

41:10.960 --> 41:12.500
- To us.
- Cheers.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.390
Timber's coming tomorrow
morning. Getting it cheap.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.890
I've had a vision of
how our place can be.

41:29.230 --> 41:31.020
Why don't people like launderettes?

41:31.100 --> 41:32.810
Because they're like toilets.

41:33.230 --> 41:35.940
This could be a Ritz among launderettes.

41:36.980 --> 41:39.360
A launderette as big as the Ritz.

41:40.650 --> 41:41.700
Yes.

42:11.190 --> 42:12.690
Clean it out.

42:14.100 --> 42:16.360
Why are you working for these people?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.570
Pakis?

42:19.360 --> 42:21.200
It's work, that's why.

42:21.650 --> 42:24.360
I want to do some work, instead
of always hanging around.

42:24.450 --> 42:27.330
- What, you're jealous?
- No, I'm angry, Johnny.

42:27.370 --> 42:30.950
I don't like to see one of
our blokes groveling to Pakis.

42:31.120 --> 42:33.500
They came over here to work for us.

42:33.710 --> 42:36.340
That's why we brought them over. Okay?

42:47.060 --> 42:50.020
Don't cut yourself off
from your own people.

42:51.230 --> 42:54.060
There's no one else
who really wants you.

42:54.900 --> 42:56.770
Everyone has to belong.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.040
I can't ask you in.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.460
You better get back to your father.

43:11.710 --> 43:14.080
I didn't think you'd ever mention him.

43:14.130 --> 43:17.130
He helped me, didn't
he, when I was at school?

43:17.920 --> 43:19.010
Yeah.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.220
And what did you do but hurt him?

43:25.720 --> 43:28.140
I want to forget all of them things.

45:37.730 --> 45:39.860
I passed by the launderette.

45:39.900 --> 45:42.610
So, you gave them the money to do it up?

45:43.160 --> 45:45.580
Where did they get it from, I wonder?

45:45.620 --> 45:48.910
Government grant. Almost
just like us, yaar.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.830
It's your bloody family.

45:50.910 --> 45:54.130
So, like you, God knows
what he does for money.

45:56.380 --> 45:57.760
Come on in.

46:00.510 --> 46:03.680
That joker's a bad influence
on Omar, I'm sure of it.

46:03.930 --> 46:07.220
There's some things between
them I'm looking into.

46:11.060 --> 46:13.020
So they let you out of
prison. Too crowded, was it?

46:13.100 --> 46:14.310
Unscrew.

46:55.230 --> 46:56.570
He's changed the lock.

46:56.650 --> 46:59.690
You better take off the whole
door, in case he changes it again.

46:59.780 --> 47:02.070
He's only a poet with no money.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.160
I ain't hurting nobody, okay?

47:21.800 --> 47:24.800
That door you've just
taken off, hang it back.

47:25.010 --> 47:25.970
Excuse me.

47:26.100 --> 47:30.100
I'm just a poor man. This is my
room. Let's leave it that way!

47:36.570 --> 47:40.360
Thieving Uncle Tom
parasite! I will kill you!

47:40.740 --> 47:43.200
Glory of God!

47:50.830 --> 47:52.710
Throw this bugger out!

48:00.720 --> 48:03.970
Filthy, imperialist swine! Working dog!

48:04.050 --> 48:06.010
Enemy of the Third World!

48:06.140 --> 48:08.970
You and your kind,
your days are numbered!

48:14.230 --> 48:17.320
Doesn't look too good, does it?
Pakis doing this kind of thing.

48:17.400 --> 48:18.650
Why not?

48:18.740 --> 48:21.360
What would your enemies
have to say about this?

48:21.450 --> 48:23.870
Ain't exactly integration, is it?

48:24.200 --> 48:27.990
I'm a professional businessman,
not a professional Pakistani.

48:28.620 --> 48:32.540
And there is no question of race
in the new enterprise culture.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.130
I'll forward your mail!

48:48.640 --> 48:50.440
Do you like the room?

48:52.940 --> 48:56.190
Omar says you have nowhere
to live. I won't charge.

48:57.610 --> 48:59.950
- Why not?
- You can unscrew.

49:00.280 --> 49:02.490
That's confirmed beautifully.

49:02.700 --> 49:04.450
But can you unblock?

49:06.410 --> 49:08.910
Can you keep this zoo under control?

49:28.140 --> 49:30.150
I wish Salim could see this.

49:30.310 --> 49:31.400
Why?

49:31.860 --> 49:33.150
He's on to us.

49:33.190 --> 49:36.780
Yes, he's just biding his
time, and then he'll get us.

49:37.320 --> 49:40.780
- Moose, make yourself useful.
- You've taken the room at Nasser's place?

49:40.870 --> 49:44.990
Make sure you pay the rent, or you'll
have to chuck yourself out the window.

49:46.910 --> 49:48.080
Moose.

49:58.670 --> 50:00.050
That'll do.

50:01.810 --> 50:04.440
Let's open. The whole world's waiting.

50:04.940 --> 50:08.190
I've invited Nasser to the
launch, and Papa's coming.

50:08.280 --> 50:11.280
- They're not here yet.
- Papa hasn't been out for months.

50:11.360 --> 50:13.570
We can't move till he arrives.

50:15.700 --> 50:18.700
- What time did they say they'd be here?
- An hour ago.

50:18.790 --> 50:20.660
They ain't gonna come.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.580
Follow me.

50:48.280 --> 50:51.070
- Shall I open the champagne?
- Didn't I predict this?

50:51.150 --> 50:52.660
You did, man.

50:52.740 --> 50:56.780
This whole stinking area's on its
knees, begging for clean trousers.

50:56.870 --> 51:00.410
The jewel in the jacks, here,
South London, this place will be.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.620
Jesus Christ.

51:04.920 --> 51:07.210
Do you want to open the place up?

51:15.510 --> 51:17.850
Not till Papa comes, remember?

51:18.350 --> 51:19.730
Your father?

51:20.100 --> 51:22.690
He went out of his way with you...

51:23.100 --> 51:25.150
and with all my friends.

51:25.900 --> 51:27.440
He did, didn't he?

51:27.530 --> 51:29.490
What you on about, man?

51:29.780 --> 51:32.570
About how, years later,
he saw the same boys.

51:33.950 --> 51:35.160
And what were they doing?

51:35.195 --> 51:36.240
What?

51:36.450 --> 51:37.410
Marching.

51:39.040 --> 51:41.040
Marching through Lewisham.

51:42.710 --> 51:45.840
It was bricks and
bottles and Union Jacks.

51:46.420 --> 51:48.710
It was "Immigrants Out," kill us.

51:48.960 --> 51:50.470
People we knew.

51:53.470 --> 51:54.970
And it was you.

51:55.050 --> 51:58.060
He saw you marching, and you
saw his face watching you.

51:58.140 --> 52:01.230
Don't deny it. We were
there when you went past.

52:10.320 --> 52:13.070
Papa hated himself and he hated his job.

52:14.410 --> 52:17.040
He was afraid on the streets for me...

52:17.290 --> 52:20.540
so he took it out on her,
and she couldn't bear it.

52:23.920 --> 52:25.380
Such failure.

52:29.720 --> 52:31.260
Such emptiness.

53:11.720 --> 53:14.090
Come on, hurry up. We're waiting.

53:15.890 --> 53:19.180
There ain't nothing I can
say to make it up to you.

53:20.810 --> 53:23.770
There's only things
I can do to show you...

53:25.440 --> 53:27.190
that I am with you.

53:27.650 --> 53:30.700
What a beautiful thing
they've done with it, isn't it?

53:30.780 --> 53:32.530
Oh, God. And with music, too.

53:32.610 --> 53:35.580
It's like a wonderful ship. I'd no idea.

53:35.870 --> 53:37.750
He's a marvel, that boy, I tell you.

53:37.830 --> 53:41.040
- You don't have to tell me.
- But I tell you everything five times.

53:41.080 --> 53:42.370
At least.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.960
Am I a bad man to you?

53:45.290 --> 53:48.340
You are sometimes careless.

53:51.260 --> 53:52.720
Dance with me.

53:56.010 --> 53:57.600
We are learning.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.430
But where are those two buggers?

54:17.450 --> 54:19.540
Johnny did all the
physical work on this.

54:19.620 --> 54:21.080
You're fond of that boy.

54:21.120 --> 54:24.630
I want to do something more to help
the other deadbeat children like him.

54:24.710 --> 54:26.420
And you're tired of work.

54:26.500 --> 54:28.760
It's time I became a holy man.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.470
- A sadhu of South London.
- Yes.

54:32.130 --> 54:34.600
But first, we must marry Omar off.

55:16.390 --> 55:18.600
- Shit!
- Typical.

55:28.190 --> 55:31.240
What the hell are you doing? Sunbathing?

55:31.530 --> 55:33.990
Asleep, Uncle. We were shagged out.

55:34.780 --> 55:36.240
Where's Papa?

55:43.710 --> 55:45.880
Would you do us the honor, madam?

55:45.960 --> 55:47.800
- Love to.
- Here.

55:52.130 --> 55:53.140
Okay.

56:26.300 --> 56:29.220
We thought we'd do the
bloody area a favor, you know.

56:29.260 --> 56:31.260
Lift up the place a bit.

56:31.300 --> 56:33.720
I can't do that. Here you are.

56:36.850 --> 56:39.230
- Hello, welcome.
- Hello.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.060
Enjoying your wash?

56:47.190 --> 56:48.400
Lovely.

56:50.950 --> 56:53.780
Launderettes are impossible.
I've got two launderettes.

56:53.815 --> 56:55.620
Two ulcers, plus piles.

56:57.200 --> 56:59.410
Hello? Angela?

56:59.910 --> 57:01.120
It's me.

57:01.210 --> 57:04.040
- What's your surname?
- Berthoty.

57:04.290 --> 57:07.300
That's it. I know your mother.

57:19.480 --> 57:21.940
I thought Papa might
just make it today, Uncle.

57:22.150 --> 57:24.770
He said he never visits launderettes.

57:25.820 --> 57:27.650
Angela, be reasonable.

57:29.190 --> 57:31.450
You can always buy some
new ones, can't you?

57:35.240 --> 57:36.740
Good. It's Tania.

57:36.830 --> 57:39.950
I've never met her, but
she has a beautiful face.

57:44.330 --> 57:46.460
Who invited Tania, damn it?

57:47.670 --> 57:49.170
I did, Uncle.

58:20.210 --> 58:22.330
Do you two know each other?

58:22.790 --> 58:25.460
At last. After so long
in my family's life.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.340
Bring Tania over here.

58:27.420 --> 58:30.170
Tania, I do feel that I know you.

58:30.760 --> 58:32.260
But you don't.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.430
Marry her. What's wrong with her?

58:35.510 --> 58:38.020
When I say marry her,
you damn well do it.

58:38.060 --> 58:40.600
I don't mind my father
having a mistress.

58:40.690 --> 58:42.690
Good. I'm so grateful.

58:43.480 --> 58:46.650
I don't mind my father
spending our money on you...

58:47.400 --> 58:48.940
Why don't you mind?

58:49.110 --> 58:52.410
Please be nice to her.
Pressure off my fucking head.

58:52.660 --> 58:55.990
...or my father being with
you, instead of with our mother.

58:56.120 --> 58:58.330
Your penis works, doesn't it?

58:59.410 --> 59:00.670
But I don't like women who live off men.

59:00.920 --> 59:02.210
Get going.

59:02.750 --> 59:06.380
That's a pretty disgusting,
parasitical thing, isn't it?

59:12.050 --> 59:14.760
Tania, come and look at the spin dryers.

59:14.890 --> 59:16.390
They're fluff drying.

59:18.640 --> 59:21.810
But tell me, who do you live off?

59:23.480 --> 59:25.530
And you must understand...

59:25.900 --> 59:28.280
we're of different generations...

59:28.700 --> 59:30.360
different classes.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.580
Everything is waiting for you.

59:35.120 --> 59:38.080
The only thing that has
ever waited for me...

59:38.960 --> 59:40.500
is your father.

59:48.300 --> 59:50.880
We'd better get going. See you, boys.

59:52.720 --> 59:55.430
No, I am not drunk, Angela.

59:56.260 --> 59:58.350
I told you, I'm not gonna see her again.

59:58.430 --> 01:00:02.560
How could I? I didn't
ask her to come, Rachel.

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.150
Please...

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.020
I'll explain to you.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:10.490
Darling, listen.

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.530
Please listen to me.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.990
It's not my fault, I
didn't ask her to come.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.910
Didn't you, then? Who did?

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.750
- The boys!
- That's what you say.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.330
You made me look stupid.

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:24.750
Can we go to the club or
something, for God's sake?

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.840
No! I'm not going anywhere with you.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.300
Please.

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.120
- Goodbye,
Omar. - Bye-bye.

01:01:08.090 --> 01:01:09.840
I want to leave home.

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:13.220
I need to break away.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.010
You'll have to help me, financially.

01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:21.060
As well as everything else, why
don't you go to the Palace no more?

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.440
Palace ain't my team.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.480
Millwall me.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.740
I'm drunk.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.700
- Will you marry me?
- What about England?

01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:36.290
I bet you don't even support
England anymore, do you?

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:39.330
- Palace gave you a trial, didn't they?
- Yeah.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.210
Told my mom Palace
wanted me for a sweeper.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.540
She said, "I reckon
that's about your level. "

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.840
If you can get me some money.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.930
Omo's getting married.

01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:04.060
I'm afraid you owe me
an awful lot of money.

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:06.480
The beard, remember?

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:10.900
Good, it's all coming back. I
think I better have that money back.

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:15.160
- I haven't got money like that now.
- Because it's all in the launderette.

01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:21.000
I'd better have a decent
down payment, then.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.420
About half.

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:25.540
By the time Nasser has
his annual party, say?

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:29.470
Or I'll instruct him to
get rid of the launderette.

01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:50.110
It took you a while to get on to us.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:53.950
Wanted to see what you'd
do. How's your Papa?

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:59.410
So many books written and read.
Politicians sought him out.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.750
Bhutto was his close friend.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.790
But we're nothing in
England without money.

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:14.760
I told you already.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.600
Come on, Angela.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.640
That's stupid.

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.400
Of course I won't.

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.820
Of course not.

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.160
Who told you that, anyway?

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.070
Didn't I tell you?

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.360
Didn't I tell you about
that noise last night?

01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:25.750
Where did you go? You just disappeared.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:30.130
Drinking, I went. With my old mates.

01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:32.390
It ain't illegal.

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.970
Of course it is. Launderettes
are a big commitment.

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.010
Why aren't you at work?

01:04:37.310 --> 01:04:38.770
It’ll be closing time soon.

01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:42.060
You'll be locking the
place up, and coming to bed.

01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:43.650
No, it never closes.

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:47.070
One of us has got to be there.
That way, we begin to make money.

01:04:47.110 --> 01:04:49.900
- You're getting greedy.
- I want big money.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.860
I'm not gonna be beat
down by this country.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:55.620
In school, you and your
friends kicked me around.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:58.450
And what are you doing
now? Washing my floor.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:00.330
That's how I like it.

01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:02.210
Now get to work.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.840
Get to work, I said,
or else you're fired.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.020
What about you?

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.480
I don't want to see
you for a little while.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.270
I got some big thinking to do.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:32.490
But today...

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:36.280
it's been the best day.

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.960
Almost the best day.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.790
I recognize you, at least.

01:07:04.090 --> 01:07:06.170
We was expecting you today.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.420
I've come.

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:12.390
The invitation was for 3:00, Mr. Ali.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.510
It's only 3:10 now.

01:07:17.850 --> 01:07:19.145
You know...

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.600
I thought I'd come to the wrong place.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:28.240
That I'd suddenly found myself in a
ladies' hairdressing salon in Pinner...

01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:32.030
where one might get a pink rinse.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:36.160
Do you do a good pink rinse?

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:43.250
Or are you still a fascist?

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.720
You used to give us a
lot of good advice, sir...

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.470
- when I was little.
- When you were little.

01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:56.775
What's it made of you?

01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:59.770
Are you a politician? Journalist?

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:01.850
Trade unionist?

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.110
No.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:06.110
You're an underpants cleaner.

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.490
Oh, dear.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.160
The working class is such a
great disappointment to me.

01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.790
I ain't made much of myself.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.960
You'd better get on and do something.

01:08:41.729 --> 01:08:42.979
Help me.

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:49.609
I don't want my son in this...

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:53.319
underpants-cleaning condition.

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.580
I want him reading in college.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.130
You tell him.

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:04.840
You go to college.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:09.840
He must have knowledge.
We all must, now...

01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:16.850
if we're to see clearly what
is being done and to whom...

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.310
in this country.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:22.689
Right?

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.109
- I don't know. It depends on what he wants.
- No.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.950
You use your influence.

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:37.370
Not a bad dump you've got here.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.920
What did you make me
come all this way for?

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.510
- What's going on?
- It's heavy, man.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:32.550
Bilquis is making magic potions
from leaves, bird beaks and stuff.

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.180
She's putting them on Rachel.

01:10:36.810 --> 01:10:38.270
Is it working?

01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:42.400
The furniture is shaking. The
trousers are walking by themselves.

01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:44.820
Rachel's come out in a rash.

01:10:45.770 --> 01:10:47.900
Glass is all over the place.

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:52.780
I'm out.

01:10:56.990 --> 01:10:59.250
Salim's got to have money, soon.

01:10:59.290 --> 01:11:01.790
A lot of money. He's threatened me.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.100
This city's chock-full of money.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:18.390
- When I used to want money...
- You'd steal it.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.560
Decide, now, if you want
it to be like that again.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.030
She's illiterate. Tania's
writing to her sister for her.

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:35.620
Bilquis is thinking about
going back to Pakistan...

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.790
after she's hospitalized
Rachel with her potion.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.170
Nasser's on a marathon sulk.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:44.800
He's going for the world record.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.670
We'll just have to do
a job to get the money.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.090
- I don't want you going back to all that.
- Just to get us through.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.430
We're going to go on.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:57.430
You want that, don't you?

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.140
Yeah. I want you.

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:03.400
Fuck me, what's she
doing with that mouse?

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.980
Bilquis!

01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.200
God damn you!

01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:48.990
Who does he reckon he is, your
uncle, some kind of big, gaspy geezer?

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:51.610
Right, maybe this just ain't my world.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.830
- Still getting married?
- I can't really get out of it.

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:57.870
If you wiggle fast
enough, you can, I reckon.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.520
England needs more young men like Omar.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.110
The more boys like that, the better.

01:13:38.290 --> 01:13:39.620
Now that Cherry's pregnant...

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.580
I will buy a house, and
we'll have many children.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.260
Listen, Zaki, here is Omar.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:57.980
You talk to him about your launderette.
He will run it for you with Johnny.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.520
Omar, my boy.

01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:03.150
I got these two damned
launderettes in your area.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:06.280
- I need big advice on them.
- I will advise you.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.610
If the launderettes are
giving you trouble...

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:12.660
I'll pay you rent for them plus
a percentage of the profits.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.780
Really?

01:14:13.870 --> 01:14:16.910
Please, can you take
charge of the music for us?

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:19.460
You've taken a great weight off my head.

01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.960
It's a deal.

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:19.100
I've got it.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.100
The installment.

01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.730
It's hefty.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.160
Don't ever offer me money.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:40.250
It was an educational
test I put on you...

01:15:40.330 --> 01:15:42.960
to make you see you did a wrong thing.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:52.140
Don't, in future, bite the family
hand when you can eat out of it.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:54.685
You need money, just ask me.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.100
Years ago, your uncles lifted me
up, and I will do the same thing.

01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:15.330
All right. He's no one.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.410
Bitch. What the hell is going on here?

01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:21.330
- Can't you control your bloody people?
- What do you mean?

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.590
Why should you be able to?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.630
You gamble most of your money away.

01:16:26.670 --> 01:16:30.380
That smooth suppository owns us.
Our education, your businesses...

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:32.430
Rachel's stockings. It's his.

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:35.140
- I thought you two were getting married.
- Any day now.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:37.770
- I'd rather drink my own urine.
- It can be tasty with a slice of lemon.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.390
Get out of my sight.

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.600
I'm going further than that.

01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:50.030
- Let's get out of here.
- Take me.

01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.700
- Salim will give us a lift.
- What?

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:55.620
I need him for something
I've got in mind.

01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:02.500
So, I was talking to Zaki about it. I
want to take over both of his launderettes.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.550
- He's got no idea.
- None.

01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:06.960
Do them up with this money.

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:10.470
Is it enough?

01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:14.100
I thought you might want to
come in with me, financially.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.180
I could do with some straight outlets.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.560
You're a smart bastard.

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.490
Look at them. What a waste of life.

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:31.360
They're filthy, ignorant.

01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:34.580
They don't respect people,
especially our people.

01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:38.200
What this scum needs is
a taste of their own piss.

01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:13.280
Right, I think I can
do something with this.

01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:15.700
Me and my partner.

01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.080
Take it.

01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:20.170
I trust you and your family.

01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:33.430
I'd happily put money into it.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.810
Right.

01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.980
Wait a minute.

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:47.940
Want to come in and take
a look at this place?

01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.280
Think we can do something with it?

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:54.990
- Can't tell without seeing it.
- Come on, then.

01:18:55.870 --> 01:18:58.160
Not if that scum Salim's there.

01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:18.750
I'm going.

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.250
Where?

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:21.750
Away.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:37.220
I'm going.

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.100
You can come.

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.730
No good jobs like this around.

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:46.610
Omar just runs you around
everywhere, like a servant.

01:20:46.645 --> 01:20:48.950
I'll stay here with my friend...

01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:51.280
and fight it out.

01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:54.620
My family, Salim and all...

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.040
will swallow you up like a little kebab.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.500
I couldn't leave him.

01:21:04.420 --> 01:21:05.710
Not now.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:09.010
Don't ask me to.

01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:15.930
You ever touched him?

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.800
So, today is the saddest day for us.

01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:32.800
I thought that I'm taking you
too much away from your family.

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:34.600
Love...

01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:36.640
money...

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:38.230
you.

01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:42.900
Besides, it's not possible
to enjoy being hated so much.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.110
Your wife is a brilliant woman.

01:22:50.410 --> 01:22:51.780
Oh, my God.

01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:55.540
And what's worse, my furniture
keeps moving about the room.

01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.390
It's not what I'm used to.

01:22:57.425 --> 01:22:59.160
The council's been around.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:02.710
We've had a time.

01:23:03.170 --> 01:23:04.630
A short time.

01:23:04.670 --> 01:23:06.050
A nice time.

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.030
I want to talk to Omo...

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.370
about business.

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.450
Don't know where he is.

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.710
Is it worth waiting?

01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:42.750
In my experience, it's
always worth waiting for Omo.

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:28.190
Paki!

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.130
Listen, damn country has done us in.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.340
That's why I'm like this.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.010
We should be there.

01:25:51.850 --> 01:25:52.930
Home.

01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:58.850
But that country's been
sodomized by religion.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.400
It's beginning to interfere
with the making of money.

01:26:05.070 --> 01:26:07.150
Compared with everywhere...

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:09.570
it's a little heaven, here.

01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.870
You are planning an
armada of launderettes?

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:22.790
What do you think of dry cleaners?

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.500
They're the past.

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:27.970
But then, they are the present, also.

01:26:28.005 --> 01:26:29.550
Mostly, they are the past.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.940
He'll die.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.320
Fuck a varmint!

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.320
Salim, get out of here!

01:26:59.790 --> 01:27:01.630
Come on, Genghis!

01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:04.590
Come on, my son.

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:08.510
Listen to me, Genghis,
I don't want to fight!

01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:10.300
- Tough.
- Kill him!

01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:14.430
Hit him!

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:22.600
- Come on.
- Kill him, Genghis!

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:25.190
That's enough, man.

01:27:25.225 --> 01:27:26.650
Kill the bum.

01:27:28.530 --> 01:27:29.950
Come on.

01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:36.330
Why are you so unhappy?

01:27:46.170 --> 01:27:49.930
Rachel's left me, and I don't
know what I'm going to do.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:23.500
Fuck you!

01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:44.570
Still look after you. I'm finished.

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.950
Only Omar matters.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:52.830
I'll make sure he's fixed up
with a good business future.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:54.740
And marriage?

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:56.500
I'm working on it.

01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.750
Is Tania a possibility?

01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:11.590
Where the hell are you going?

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.750
- I...
- What?

01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.170
I think I better go.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.300
I think I had.

01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:48.300
You were always going at school.
Always running about, you.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:51.510
Christ, your hand is bad.

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:54.510
I couldn't even pin you down, then.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.310
And now I'm going again.
Give us my handbag.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.980
You're dirty. You're beautiful.

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:02.610
I'm serious. Don't keep touching me.
