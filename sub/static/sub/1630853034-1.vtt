02:45.115 --> 02:46.613
Next
stop, Rainey Avenue,

02:46.655 --> 02:48.556
doors open on the left.

02:49.392 --> 02:50.716
Oh my gosh, mommy!

02:50.758 --> 02:52.014
- Mommy!
- Oh my god!

02:52.056 --> 02:53.884
This is
the eastbound E train.

02:53.926 --> 02:55.787
Next stop, Washington Avenue.

03:00.933 --> 03:01.965
Ah.

03:04.266 --> 03:05.126
There you are.

03:06.939 --> 03:09.379
Maya told you, didn't she?

03:10.877 --> 03:12.903
Now how would you know that?

03:12.945 --> 03:15.301
She tells you everything.

03:15.343 --> 03:17.684
I think you read my mind.

03:18.918 --> 03:22.583
What did I
say about doing that?

03:22.625 --> 03:25.454
Very clever, it's impolite!

03:25.496 --> 03:26.488
Stop it, Vista!

03:26.530 --> 03:27.753
I'm not joking!

03:27.795 --> 03:29.249
You know you're never
allowed in my head.

03:36.606 --> 03:38.830
All right, come
on, hand it over.

03:38.872 --> 03:40.128
Come on.

03:40.170 --> 03:41.261
That's not fair!

03:41.303 --> 03:42.643
Hand it over.

03:49.685 --> 03:53.845
Reading a person's mind,
unless it's for a mission is?

03:53.887 --> 03:55.946
A privilege that
warrants approval.

03:55.988 --> 03:57.460
That's right.

03:58.991 --> 04:03.763
So
where are you going?

04:07.197 --> 04:09.256
I'd like to have an address.

04:09.298 --> 04:10.895
Why?

04:10.937 --> 04:13.326
Well, 'cause I
know Ansel will want

04:13.368 --> 04:14.609
to write to you.

04:16.646 --> 04:18.132
New York City.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.904
Squirreling back to Manhattan.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.684
I have a little gift for you.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.185
It's just your watch.

04:37.227 --> 04:39.693
Oh no, it's a compass.

04:39.735 --> 04:42.795
Matter of fact, it's the
compass my mother gave me.

04:42.837 --> 04:45.567
She told me it would take
me wherever I wanted to go,

04:45.609 --> 04:48.504
bring me home when I was done.

04:48.546 --> 04:50.073
Thanks, I guess.

04:59.414 --> 05:01.110
You hate me.

05:01.152 --> 05:02.584
I beg your pardon?

05:02.626 --> 05:04.120
I read your mind.

05:06.058 --> 05:07.182
Don't think that.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.052
I mean, I don't hate you.

05:09.094 --> 05:12.227
I was a little
frustrated, that's all.

05:14.033 --> 05:17.034
Mind if I ride with
you for a while?

05:20.611 --> 05:21.610
Fine.

05:32.447 --> 05:37.351
Stay together,
everybody stay together, come on.

05:38.288 --> 05:39.419
My favorite!

05:41.225 --> 05:43.218
The
Hyperions Family Museum

05:43.260 --> 05:46.122
will be closing in 10 minutes.

05:46.164 --> 05:48.091
Thank you for visiting.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.796
The United
States Space Program

05:49.838 --> 05:52.095
calls upon the high
security to assist

05:52.137 --> 05:54.170
in the tests of Earth.

05:57.582 --> 06:00.576
This is a housing
project right here.

06:00.618 --> 06:02.545
This is, people would live here.

06:02.587 --> 06:05.181
This is a five story building.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.159
The museum
will be closing very soon.

06:23.201 --> 06:25.326
Please follow the
green exit signs

06:25.368 --> 06:27.262
through the gift shop.

06:27.304 --> 06:31.240
Thank you for visiting the
Hyperion Family Museum.

07:12.118 --> 07:13.480
Who's that?

07:16.760 --> 07:18.346
Professor
Mandulbaum here.

07:18.388 --> 07:21.217
The Hyperions and I hope
you had a grand time.

07:21.259 --> 07:23.351
Please visit again soon.

07:23.393 --> 07:24.693
- Okay.
- Right.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.229
Yeah.

07:27.232 --> 07:28.158
Oh, ma'am we're closing.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.665
Sir, Ma'am?

07:29.707 --> 07:30.607
Ma'am?

07:40.344 --> 07:41.908
Everybody against the wall!

07:41.950 --> 07:44.075
Ansel, your gun!

07:44.117 --> 07:46.209
Oh, shit!

07:46.251 --> 07:48.541
Get against the wall.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.015
Get against the wall.

07:50.057 --> 07:51.544
Now!

07:51.586 --> 07:54.019
Make a little group,
that's it, together.

07:54.061 --> 07:55.126
Okay.

08:39.809 --> 08:41.131
Ansel?

08:41.174 --> 08:42.712
Ansel!

08:43.605 --> 08:44.707
What's this?

08:44.749 --> 08:45.774
They're locked in.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.475
Locked in?

08:50.513 --> 08:51.747
You work here?

08:51.789 --> 08:52.814
Me?

08:52.856 --> 08:55.212
You, yes, come here.

08:55.254 --> 08:57.115
I need the key to
this display lock.

08:57.157 --> 08:59.282
There isn't a
key to that case.

08:59.324 --> 09:01.757
What do you mean
there isn't a key?

09:01.799 --> 09:03.286
What is this, what
am I looking at?

09:03.328 --> 09:05.486
Fingerprint identification.

09:05.528 --> 09:08.423
It's the only way
to open the case.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.938
Which one of you can open it?

09:20.048 --> 09:22.477
I need to make a phone call.

09:29.486 --> 09:31.314
Distro Chex soap

09:31.356 --> 09:34.856
and American Millimeter
Films present

09:34.898 --> 09:36.700
Professor Mandulbaum's

09:37.967 --> 09:39.494
Hyperions!

09:41.168 --> 09:43.194
Where each week we're
invited into the mysterious

09:43.236 --> 09:47.469
headquarters of the world's
only superhero family.

09:55.413 --> 09:59.507
And now your host,
Professor Ruckus Mandulbaum.

09:59.549 --> 10:01.608
Good day, Hyperion
club members.

10:01.650 --> 10:03.984
And welcome to Hyperion Hall.

10:04.026 --> 10:06.349
How are you doing
today, Mercury?

10:06.391 --> 10:07.482
Suit up for adventure!

10:07.524 --> 10:09.891
You can say that
again, old friend.

10:09.933 --> 10:12.322
You know, it's been
nearly 20 years

10:12.364 --> 10:15.622
since the remarkable story
of the Hyperions began.

10:15.664 --> 10:19.527
And nearly 20 years
since I invented this.

10:19.569 --> 10:21.463
The Titan Badge.

10:21.505 --> 10:23.168
I know it doesn't look
like much, does it?

10:23.210 --> 10:25.665
But believe you me,
this little device

10:25.707 --> 10:27.542
packs quite a punch.

10:28.413 --> 10:31.011
Let me show you what I mean.

10:31.053 --> 10:32.573
Everyone you know
from your best friend

10:32.615 --> 10:36.016
to your math teacher is filled
with this magical material.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.150
It's called DNA.

10:38.192 --> 10:40.482
DNA is given to
you by your parents

10:40.524 --> 10:42.748
and acts like a
blueprint for the body.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.190
Everything from eye color
to the shape of your nose

10:45.232 --> 10:48.523
is contained in this
little strand of DNA.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.723
So what does this
little fellow do?

10:50.765 --> 10:54.936
Well, when I make a badge,
I make it for one person.

10:54.978 --> 10:56.762
It plugs into that person's DNA

10:56.804 --> 11:00.502
and changes one piece
of their blueprint.

11:00.544 --> 11:03.373
For example, I can tell the
body to have x-ray vision

11:03.415 --> 11:08.081
or to be able to shrink
to the size of an ant.

11:08.123 --> 11:10.512
So you see, this Titan Badge

11:10.554 --> 11:13.614
can grant an individual
a superhuman power.

11:13.656 --> 11:16.624
Imagine that, a
real life superhero.

11:17.693 --> 11:19.191
So the question became

11:19.233 --> 11:22.095
who do I choose to
give this power to?

11:22.137 --> 11:24.790
I traveled the globe in
search of the brightest,

11:24.832 --> 11:26.902
most selfless young
people on earth,

11:26.944 --> 11:31.038
finally finding three
suitable candidates.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.238
Maya was given the
ability to teleport

11:33.280 --> 11:36.406
from place to place with
nothing more than a thought.

11:36.448 --> 11:40.245
Vista was granted the ability
to read and influence minds.

11:40.287 --> 11:42.445
And Ansel, the youngest
of the children

11:42.487 --> 11:45.481
gained super strength,
becoming the strongest human

11:45.523 --> 11:47.021
ever to live.

11:47.063 --> 11:49.584
I brought the children into
my home where we trained,

11:49.626 --> 11:52.895
awaiting the day when their
powers would be needed.

11:52.937 --> 11:55.333
And boy, were they needed.

11:56.699 --> 11:58.699
Adventure!

12:03.607 --> 12:04.606
Exploration!

12:10.251 --> 12:11.481
Heroic rescues!

12:14.783 --> 12:17.249
For 20 years, the
valiant exploits

12:17.291 --> 12:19.581
of Professor
Mandelbaum's Hyperions

12:19.623 --> 12:22.122
have shaped out world.

12:22.164 --> 12:24.131
Calling all Hyperions.

12:25.332 --> 12:26.852
And
for nearly 20 years

12:26.894 --> 12:29.327
we'd been invited each
week to witness retellings

12:29.369 --> 12:31.791
of their unbelievable stories

12:31.833 --> 12:34.603
through the Hyperions
television program.

12:41.513 --> 12:43.209
Follow team leader Maya,

12:43.251 --> 12:45.475
the teleporting Titan!

12:45.517 --> 12:48.511
Vista, the mind-reading
rapscallion!

12:48.553 --> 12:52.185
And Ansel, the
strongest boy alive

12:52.227 --> 12:56.882
as they show the world the
meaning of the world family.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.457
Over the years, the
Hyperions have faced

13:00.499 --> 13:03.724
innumerable threats
both at home and abroad.

13:03.766 --> 13:07.200
Our contributions to world
peace are beyond debate.

13:07.242 --> 13:08.868
Members come and go.

13:10.377 --> 13:12.469
Every few years we bid
farewell to the old class

13:12.511 --> 13:15.670
and welcome three new
team members to carry on

13:15.712 --> 13:17.672
the tradition of service.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.345
In fact, just last month,
we announced the end

13:20.387 --> 13:21.841
of our second class,

13:21.883 --> 13:23.953
and the search for our third
generation of team members

13:23.995 --> 13:25.218
has already begun.

13:25.260 --> 13:27.616
So far, we have chosen only one.

13:27.658 --> 13:31.521
Meet Apollo, our
brand new Hyperion.

13:31.563 --> 13:34.491
But the search continues
for the other two.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.973
Could you be the next Hyperion?

13:40.770 --> 13:42.862
Next question,
how's the family?

13:42.904 --> 13:43.837
The family is,

13:46.050 --> 13:47.636
gosh, what is it?

13:47.678 --> 13:48.736
Marvelous.

13:48.778 --> 13:50.045
Marvelous, right.

13:50.087 --> 13:52.476
Look, I can't remember
all these lines.

13:52.518 --> 13:54.610
I mean why are we even
doing this interview

13:54.652 --> 13:55.776
with what was her name again?

13:55.818 --> 13:57.316
Meredith Lane.

13:57.358 --> 13:59.747
She's very influential
with the 15 over demographic.

13:59.789 --> 14:01.525
Sign here.

14:01.793 --> 14:03.520
Once again, how's the family?

14:03.562 --> 14:05.126
Family's fine,
thank you for asking.

14:05.168 --> 14:06.424
They're marvelous.

14:06.466 --> 14:08.129
Marvelous.

14:08.171 --> 14:09.394
Hyperion call.

14:09.436 --> 14:11.099
Sir, Mercury's ringing.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.892
- Let me get that.
- They're going to have to call back later.

14:12.934 --> 14:14.802
We're almost at the studio.
Sign here.

14:17.543 --> 14:18.469
What's your name?

14:18.511 --> 14:19.767
Delano.

14:19.809 --> 14:20.735
Delano.

14:20.777 --> 14:21.835
I need you to call this number.

14:21.877 --> 14:23.870
Call it over and over again.

14:23.912 --> 14:25.047
If no one picks up,

14:25.089 --> 14:26.939
hang up and call again.

14:26.981 --> 14:28.941
Do that until you get an answer.

14:28.983 --> 14:31.680
When you do, yell out for me.

14:31.722 --> 14:32.688
Understand?

14:34.131 --> 14:36.916
Are you the real Vista?

14:36.958 --> 14:39.325
Say you understand.

14:39.367 --> 14:40.861
I understand.

14:48.035 --> 14:49.467
What are you doing?

14:49.509 --> 14:51.634
What did I just say?

14:51.676 --> 14:53.346
Hah, yeah, no, oh!

14:54.712 --> 14:56.111
So close.

14:56.153 --> 14:58.080
Come on, a little higher.

14:58.122 --> 15:00.775
Oh, good throw, good
throw, like a rocket.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.679
What the hell
is going on here?

15:03.721 --> 15:05.483
Trying to knock down
the security cameras.

15:05.525 --> 15:07.188
Police can tap
right into those,

15:07.230 --> 15:08.783
see right into here.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.290
Who are you?

15:10.332 --> 15:12.820
Olly Pinkletter, I'm the
junior security guard here.

15:12.862 --> 15:14.690
Yeah, Ollie here,
he has some experience

15:14.732 --> 15:16.296
with robbing places
and so you know,

15:16.338 --> 15:17.858
just tell her, go ahead.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.201
I robbed the place across
the street two years ago.

15:20.243 --> 15:22.500
Yeah, he's giving
some advice, that's all.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.996
Cameras, knock 'em down,

15:24.038 --> 15:26.669
how to deal with
hostage negotiators.

15:26.711 --> 15:29.903
Oh and, you forgot to frisk me.

15:29.945 --> 15:31.344
Pardon me.

15:31.386 --> 15:33.511
But I think you two need
to tell the rest of us here

15:33.553 --> 15:34.710
what's going on.

15:34.752 --> 15:35.777
Is this real?

15:35.819 --> 15:37.042
Yes ma'am, this is real.

15:37.084 --> 15:38.186
Miss.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.517
- That's what I hate.
- Mr. Ansel.

15:39.559 --> 15:40.452
My name is,

15:41.693 --> 15:43.092
Do you mind signing this?

15:43.134 --> 15:44.159
Well I want that too.

15:44.201 --> 15:45.688
I usually take
the bullets out.

15:45.730 --> 15:47.294
Anna, Anna, A.

15:47.336 --> 15:48.724
Would you mind taking
a picture with me?

15:48.766 --> 15:49.989
Maybe try this on.

15:50.031 --> 15:52.057
- I mean not now.
- I was here first.

15:52.099 --> 15:54.697
- I'll show you the exhibits and I know everything.
- How close to the actual plane?

15:54.739 --> 15:56.442
- What did he say?
- Ah!

16:03.253 --> 16:04.384
I have a gun.

16:05.783 --> 16:07.347
Okay?

16:07.389 --> 16:08.454
This is real.

16:09.787 --> 16:11.721
Now, just,

16:12.823 --> 16:14.717
take a seat over there

16:14.759 --> 16:17.760
and we'll be out
of here in no time.

16:19.962 --> 16:21.053
Okay, uh,

16:21.095 --> 16:22.692
look, what did he say?

16:22.734 --> 16:23.832
On the phone?

16:24.637 --> 16:26.109
He didn't answer.

16:27.607 --> 16:29.094
He didn't answer?

16:29.136 --> 16:31.734
What are we gonna do?

16:31.776 --> 16:32.966
How are we gonna
get out of here?

16:33.008 --> 16:34.099
What's our next move?

16:34.141 --> 16:35.705
I need a minute to think.

16:35.747 --> 16:37.076
Vis.

16:38.145 --> 16:40.182
Hey, Ollie.

16:40.224 --> 16:42.580
Is there a way to get out of here,
like a loading area or something?

16:42.622 --> 16:44.714
- Oh yeah, actually, if you head down-
- Hey, hey, hey, no.

16:44.756 --> 16:46.045
No, no, no, no, no.

16:46.087 --> 16:48.454
We are not going anywhere
without those badges.

16:48.496 --> 16:49.422
All right, we talked about this.

16:49.464 --> 16:50.588
Okay.

16:50.630 --> 16:51.820
You said this would
take five minutes.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.459
You said we'd be
out of here by now

16:53.501 --> 16:54.559
and nothing can go wrong!

16:54.601 --> 16:55.824
Yeah, well you
said that the badges

16:55.866 --> 16:57.496
were only protected by
a single pane of glass

16:57.538 --> 16:59.927
which is what I
based the plan on.

16:59.969 --> 17:02.468
Okay, well yeah, I did say
that, yes, that is true.

17:07.977 --> 17:09.811
Hyperion Family Museum.

17:13.587 --> 17:15.382
It's the police.

17:15.424 --> 17:18.953
They want to talk to
whoever's in charge.

17:25.896 --> 17:26.796
Hey, Vista.

17:27.535 --> 17:28.666
Vista!

17:30.373 --> 17:33.598
What am I gonna do
with these people?

17:33.640 --> 17:34.797
Hey.

17:34.839 --> 17:35.871
Hey.

17:37.171 --> 17:38.966
Just give us a minute.

17:39.008 --> 17:41.100
Yeah, you guys
could just, I guess,

17:41.945 --> 17:42.944
Oh boy.

18:05.672 --> 18:07.533
On scene and we
are now in position.

18:39.266 --> 18:40.962
Remember when we
enter, take a moment

18:41.004 --> 18:42.898
to assess the situation.

18:42.940 --> 18:45.571
Assess, plan and act.

18:45.613 --> 18:46.843
Right, okay.

18:48.077 --> 18:49.252
Ready?

18:50.013 --> 18:51.144
Yeah.

18:52.389 --> 18:54.041
Yeah, I'm ready.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.885
Remember to breathe.

19:18.976 --> 19:20.342
Shit.

19:30.152 --> 19:32.387
Hello, Maya.

20:38.462 --> 20:39.285
Agh!

20:42.158 --> 20:44.690
Junior Mints.

20:44.732 --> 20:46.857
No, I think we
did really well.

20:46.899 --> 20:48.155
Honestly.

20:48.197 --> 20:49.636
Oh, thank you.

20:51.167 --> 20:52.665
I feel like I did pretty good.

20:52.707 --> 20:54.964
Don't, don't scratch that.

20:55.006 --> 20:57.197
But the hole's itchy.

20:57.239 --> 21:00.042
Gunshots to the
chest can sting.

21:01.210 --> 21:04.908
I'd recommend next
time using your power.

21:04.950 --> 21:07.878
Turn my skin into metal?

21:07.920 --> 21:10.815
I think it would have made
a difference, don't you?

21:10.857 --> 21:13.147
Yeah, if you think so.

21:13.189 --> 21:14.313
Are you there, Maya?

21:14.355 --> 21:15.490
Are you there?

21:15.532 --> 21:16.722
Go for Maya.

21:16.764 --> 21:19.285
It's a bad connection,
can you speak up?

21:19.327 --> 21:20.990
Excuse me, I beg your pardon.

21:21.032 --> 21:23.124
Thank you so much.

21:23.166 --> 21:24.165
Hello?

21:25.069 --> 21:27.128
Yes, I need you back right away.

21:27.170 --> 21:28.866
The news is saying there's
a hostage situation

21:28.908 --> 21:30.736
at the museum!

21:30.778 --> 21:33.167
Somebody's attempting
to pinch my shit!

21:33.209 --> 21:34.872
Wait, are you alone?

21:34.914 --> 21:36.236
Did I say shit?

21:36.278 --> 21:37.277
On my way.

21:38.786 --> 21:40.174
Maya.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.599
Speaking French.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.030
<i>Merci.</i>

22:01.072 --> 22:02.262
Looks like you're
gonna be staying

22:02.304 --> 22:04.231
with Dr. Charles
for the week, okay?

22:04.273 --> 22:06.167
Do you want the remote?

22:06.209 --> 22:07.135
Who's Dr. Charles?

22:07.177 --> 22:08.037
Where am I?

22:08.079 --> 22:09.111
Paris.

22:10.884 --> 22:11.777
Every time I stay here,

22:11.819 --> 22:14.241
I beg Dr. Charles to get cable.

22:14.283 --> 22:15.755
Oh, MASH.

22:16.417 --> 22:17.750
Who's Dr. Charles?

22:17.792 --> 22:20.463
Oh, he's our
private physician.

22:22.093 --> 22:23.921
Look, do me a favor.

22:23.963 --> 22:25.890
It's very important you
don't tell the Professor

22:25.932 --> 22:27.760
about your injury.

22:27.802 --> 22:30.224
Don't tell him about Dr.
Charles either, okay?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.606
Yeah, of course.

22:33.170 --> 22:34.169
Why?

22:36.679 --> 22:39.233
There are some details the
public shouldn't know about.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.609
And since the Professor's
the face of the team,

22:41.651 --> 22:43.072
we wouldn't wanna put
him in a situation

22:43.114 --> 22:46.108
where he'd have to lie
to the public, would we?

22:46.150 --> 22:48.913
Hey Maya,
what's your ETA?

22:48.955 --> 22:50.152
Leaving now.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.481
Sergeant, I don't
want you to worry a bit.

22:56.523 --> 22:57.988
I've written every
single word you've said

22:58.030 --> 22:59.990
in my notebook.

23:00.032 --> 23:03.125
I won't let you down again, sir.

23:03.167 --> 23:04.298
Over and out.

23:05.200 --> 23:07.261
All units,
we have a code 805,

23:07.303 --> 23:08.544
repeat, code 805.

23:10.207 --> 23:13.135
All right people,
look alive, goddamit!

23:13.177 --> 23:14.433
Sergeant Burns just confirmed

23:14.475 --> 23:17.106
that we've got a
Hyperion en route.

23:17.148 --> 23:19.654
Not a good time to look stupid.

23:20.888 --> 23:22.184
Oh God.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.411
Hey, Fitzpatrick, come here.

23:25.453 --> 23:27.116
I locked my keys in the car.

23:27.158 --> 23:28.150
Take care of that one.

23:29.292 --> 23:31.864
Are you
Captain Woodcock?

23:33.230 --> 23:35.025
Looks like
a hostage situation.

23:35.067 --> 23:37.566
Any idea how
many are inside, demands?

23:37.608 --> 23:39.128
No words
from anybody inside.

23:39.170 --> 23:40.965
What about
security cameras?

23:41.007 --> 23:42.835
Cameras inside
are just for show.

23:42.877 --> 23:44.166
Non functional.

23:44.208 --> 23:46.102
You've attempted
contact by phone?

23:46.144 --> 23:48.045
They keep hanging up.

23:49.246 --> 23:51.206
Have you tried
knocking on the door?

23:53.547 --> 23:54.682
The
Hyperion Arm Device

23:54.724 --> 23:56.717
attaches onto the forearm.

23:56.759 --> 23:58.950
The Titan Badge is
then locked into place

23:58.992 --> 24:00.985
allowing the precision
needle to act as a highway

24:01.027 --> 24:03.731
for the DNA altering
material to,

24:13.776 --> 24:16.238
We've run into
a small problem.

24:17.780 --> 24:22.717
Nothing big, but we might need
more time than we discussed.

24:23.786 --> 24:26.373
What constitutes
a small problem?

24:26.415 --> 24:28.045
Nothing, really.

24:28.087 --> 24:30.377
Everything's fine.

24:30.419 --> 24:33.215
When will I have them?

24:36.733 --> 24:38.128
I'll call you.

24:59.514 --> 25:01.111
Maya.

25:01.153 --> 25:02.651
Vista.

25:02.693 --> 25:04.213
What are you doing here?

25:04.255 --> 25:06.248
These men think there's a
robbery going on in there.

25:06.290 --> 25:07.256
There is.

25:08.127 --> 25:09.416
Well, do you have the thieves?

25:09.458 --> 25:10.857
How many are there?

25:10.899 --> 25:12.221
Have you spoken
to the Professor?

25:12.263 --> 25:13.768
Not yet.

25:14.003 --> 25:15.587
Well, let me in, I'll help.

25:15.629 --> 25:16.870
I can't.

25:17.305 --> 25:20.229
I'm the one robbing the place.

25:20.271 --> 25:21.296
You're kidding.

25:21.338 --> 25:22.238
No.

25:23.373 --> 25:25.465
And I need the
Professor right away.

25:25.507 --> 25:27.441
Have you lost your mind?

25:32.481 --> 25:34.309
Don't bother trying
to teleport in here.

25:34.351 --> 25:35.658
I have the cork.

25:36.650 --> 25:37.851
You don't.

25:37.893 --> 25:39.248
What is the cork?

25:39.290 --> 25:43.450
Well, this little device
acts as my security system

25:43.492 --> 25:46.255
in preventing any abuse
in power that may come

25:46.297 --> 25:49.555
from granting the
Hyperions super powers.

25:49.597 --> 25:51.425
With one push of a button,

25:51.467 --> 25:54.769
I am able to generate
a power-free radius

25:54.811 --> 25:58.300
where none of the Titan
badges can function.

25:58.342 --> 25:59.972
Let me give you an example.

26:00.014 --> 26:02.843
Take this dashing super
powered Hyperion Team member.

26:02.885 --> 26:03.635
Mmm?

26:03.677 --> 26:04.845
Yes, you.

26:04.887 --> 26:06.473
Would you mind showing
us what happens

26:06.515 --> 26:10.180
when you attempt to use
your power in the cork zone?

26:17.328 --> 26:18.925
You stole the cork?

26:18.967 --> 26:19.959
How did you get it?

26:20.001 --> 26:21.290
It doesn't matter.

26:21.332 --> 26:23.490
The inside of this museum
is off limits to you.

26:23.532 --> 26:25.360
Vista, you're
making a big mistake.

26:25.402 --> 26:26.691
We need the Professor now,

26:26.733 --> 26:28.000
we don't have much time.

26:28.042 --> 26:28.876
Who's we?

26:30.209 --> 26:32.906
I, I need the Professor.

26:32.948 --> 26:35.634
Did you seriously
drag Ansel into this?

26:35.676 --> 26:37.372
Bring him here.

26:38.745 --> 26:41.013
What the hell
are you thinking?

26:41.055 --> 26:44.386
Holding up the museum,
taking hostages?

26:45.620 --> 26:47.547
And then you have the
nerve to make demands of me

26:47.589 --> 26:49.028
and your father.

26:50.064 --> 26:51.386
You don't get to do
that, young lady.

26:51.428 --> 26:53.993
Drop the weird
babysitter routine, Maya.

26:54.035 --> 26:56.831
I'm not trying to be
your goddamn babysitter.

26:56.873 --> 26:59.658
I'm trying to talk to
you one adult to another.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.935
What are you doing here?

27:01.977 --> 27:05.235
I just need the
Professor to come.

27:05.277 --> 27:06.335
That's all this is?

27:06.377 --> 27:08.909
Some bizarre way
of reconnecting?

27:08.951 --> 27:10.702
This has nothing
to do with you.

27:10.744 --> 27:12.407
Of course it does!

27:12.449 --> 27:13.815
You abandoned us 10 years ago

27:13.857 --> 27:15.278
like a spoiled brat.

27:15.320 --> 27:18.545
And then out of nowhere
you hold up the museum.

27:18.587 --> 27:20.928
And dragging Ansel into it?

27:23.229 --> 27:24.800
I'm trapped, Maya.

27:27.266 --> 27:29.457
Let me get you and
Ansel out of here.

27:29.499 --> 27:30.260
I can't.

27:30.302 --> 27:32.031
I'll take you home.

27:32.073 --> 27:35.364
I can't, I can't go anywhere.

27:35.406 --> 27:36.937
This is gonna break
your father's heart.

27:36.979 --> 27:38.202
Don't call him that.

27:38.244 --> 27:39.731
Don't call him what?

27:39.773 --> 27:40.941
He's not my father!

27:40.983 --> 27:42.602
Vista, be gentle.

27:42.644 --> 27:45.242
You've both made mistakes.

27:45.284 --> 27:46.481
I was a kid.

27:47.517 --> 27:50.511
I was allowed to make mistakes.

27:50.553 --> 27:52.183
How many apology letters
do I have to write?

27:52.225 --> 27:53.745
I sent hundreds.

27:53.787 --> 27:57.485
And all the while he just
dragged my name through the mud

27:57.527 --> 27:59.421
for like 10 years,
as if cutting me off

27:59.463 --> 28:00.862
in every way wasn't enough?

28:00.904 --> 28:02.655
I wake up every other night

28:02.697 --> 28:05.460
with lingering pains
from years of injuries.

28:05.502 --> 28:09.068
Broken bones, gunshot
wounds, stab wounds,

28:09.110 --> 28:10.307
I was stabbed!

28:13.983 --> 28:15.602
He wasn't always
aware of everything.

28:15.644 --> 28:16.471
Oh, please.

28:16.513 --> 28:17.545
Vista.

28:18.812 --> 28:20.772
Don't be so eager to
destroy the man's legacy.

28:20.814 --> 28:22.345
He cares about you.

28:22.387 --> 28:24.853
He cares about the team,
not the people on it.

28:24.895 --> 28:26.745
And I'm no longer an employee.

28:26.787 --> 28:28.714
You're wrong. Ruckus has never
just thought of us as employees.

28:28.756 --> 28:29.682
Not you, at least.

28:29.724 --> 28:31.024
What's that supposed to mean?

28:31.066 --> 28:31.959
Come on, Maya.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.752
You were always the favorite.

28:33.794 --> 28:36.491
Ruckus cares about
all of us equally.

28:39.734 --> 28:41.140
Vista!

28:43.639 --> 28:47.707
Don't forget which one
of us used to read minds.

28:53.352 --> 28:54.608
Leave your men
outside of the building.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.884
Nobody enters.

28:55.926 --> 28:57.024
Yes, ma'am.

29:01.855 --> 29:03.261
Maya.

29:03.934 --> 29:05.934
Just give me a moment.

29:07.201 --> 29:09.194
Look, I know I'm not
supposed to be seen in public-

29:11.634 --> 29:13.330
I'm kind of in the
middle of something, Ares.

29:13.372 --> 29:14.298
I completely understand.

29:14.340 --> 29:15.497
I don't wanna be a bother.

29:15.539 --> 29:16.938
Wait, what country is this?

29:16.980 --> 29:18.500
Is this Idaho?

29:18.542 --> 29:20.172
What's on your mind, Ares?

29:20.214 --> 29:22.911
Maya, I wanna be
back on the team.

29:22.953 --> 29:25.111
I could train like you did.

29:25.153 --> 29:27.080
I'm a Hyperion
through and through.

29:27.122 --> 29:29.214
- Ares.
- Look, I know the Professor and I

29:29.256 --> 29:30.512
have had our fair
share of headbutting.

29:30.554 --> 29:31.843
I wasn't perfect.

29:31.885 --> 29:33.317
Hell, sometimes I
was even a burden.

29:33.359 --> 29:35.484
But look at these!

29:35.526 --> 29:36.881
I've photocopied
some news articles

29:36.923 --> 29:39.620
I believe highlights some
of the great work I've done.

29:39.662 --> 29:40.720
Like this one, when I assisted

29:40.762 --> 29:43.063
in the Atlantic
Pipeline rupture.

29:43.105 --> 29:45.934
Or this one when I assisted
in the USS Sherman expedition.

29:45.976 --> 29:47.628
And I didn't even
complain when I was asked

29:47.670 --> 29:50.037
to supervise
negotiations in Korea.

29:50.079 --> 29:53.172
Even though the dear
leader was super handsy.

29:53.214 --> 29:56.538
Ares, please be understanding.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.441
You've done a wonderful job.

29:58.483 --> 30:00.879
I could do more, Maya.

30:02.223 --> 30:06.317
The Professor's firm
on this, it's time to go.

30:06.359 --> 30:08.220
You're gonna have all the
money you'll ever need.

30:10.132 --> 30:12.290
Don't make waves again.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.760
Let it go.

30:20.769 --> 30:22.571
You go home now, Ares.

30:41.625 --> 30:43.255
What
happened, who was it?

30:43.297 --> 30:44.685
Maya.

30:44.727 --> 30:47.127
Hey, what's your name again?

30:47.169 --> 30:48.425
Delano.

30:48.467 --> 30:50.460
Can you give
me a hand up here?

30:50.502 --> 30:51.857
What did Maya say?

30:51.899 --> 30:53.628
She's
bringing the Professor.

30:53.670 --> 30:55.102
- Delano.
- Yes?

30:55.144 --> 30:57.401
I need you to help
me block this door, okay?

30:57.443 --> 30:58.699
So maybe some boxes.

30:58.741 --> 30:59.733
Do you have anything bigger?

30:59.775 --> 31:01.009
Yeah.

31:01.051 --> 31:02.868
- What else have you got?
- I was thinking about

31:02.910 --> 31:04.507
what we talked about
earlier, remember?

31:04.549 --> 31:06.245
If things were
to get out of hand,

31:06.287 --> 31:08.610
instead of just handing
over the badges,

31:08.652 --> 31:10.546
why don't we just use 'em?

31:10.588 --> 31:12.119
It hasn't come to that yet.

31:12.161 --> 31:15.749
Yeah but I still kind of think
we should at least be ready

31:15.791 --> 31:17.131
to use the powers.

31:19.696 --> 31:21.003
Ansel.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.922
I need to know that
you're doing this

31:23.964 --> 31:25.627
for the same reason I am.

31:25.669 --> 31:26.991
Oh, of course,

31:27.033 --> 31:28.663
this is about Ruby,
getting your daughter back.

31:28.705 --> 31:29.631
- Right.
- Yeah.

31:29.673 --> 31:31.600
So we stick to the plan.

31:31.642 --> 31:33.635
We do what they ask,
give them the badges

31:33.677 --> 31:35.142
and they'll let her go.

31:35.184 --> 31:38.046
Okay, but how do we
know that they will?

31:38.088 --> 31:40.147
If we were to use the badges,

31:40.189 --> 31:42.006
it just would make
more sense if,

31:42.048 --> 31:43.355
Ansel.

31:45.458 --> 31:49.229
You know that the badges
don't make you happy.

31:50.331 --> 31:51.686
You're so much
more than some guy

31:51.728 --> 31:54.663
who can lift a
car over his head.

31:56.139 --> 31:58.825
Besides, how many
people need cars

31:58.867 --> 32:01.571
lifted over their heads anyway?

32:17.127 --> 32:19.978
Our guest this evening
requires no introduction.

32:20.020 --> 32:22.123
He is known and beloved
throughout the world

32:22.165 --> 32:24.917
as the father and
leader of the world's

32:24.959 --> 32:28.019
most famous family
of superheroes.

32:28.061 --> 32:31.660
He is of course, Professor
Ruckus Mandulbaum.

32:31.702 --> 32:33.728
Welcome to the show, Professor.

32:33.770 --> 32:36.236
Thank you for
having me, Meredith.

32:36.278 --> 32:38.766
I suppose we should
also welcome Mercury.

32:38.808 --> 32:39.734
Yes.

32:39.776 --> 32:41.505
Say hello, Mercury.

32:41.547 --> 32:42.935
Adventure awaits!

32:42.977 --> 32:44.244
Brilliant.

32:44.286 --> 32:45.872
And how's the family?

32:45.914 --> 32:47.643
The team is just,

32:47.685 --> 32:50.877
don't tell me, it's right
on the tip of my tongue.

32:50.919 --> 32:52.483
Marvelous?

32:52.525 --> 32:54.584
Why yes, yes, thank
you, marvelous, marvelous.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.916
Now you're in the middle of a
transition, are you not?

32:56.958 --> 32:59.523
With the second
team being replaced?

32:59.565 --> 33:02.559
Yes, we are retiring
the second generation

33:02.601 --> 33:07.564
and currently in the process

33:07.606 --> 33:09.896
of finding a new team.

33:09.938 --> 33:12.030
We do have a new member.

33:12.072 --> 33:13.900
- Apollo.
- Yes.

33:13.942 --> 33:15.033
That's me.

33:15.075 --> 33:16.844
And
how is he coming?

33:19.321 --> 33:22.282
I don't know what you're saying.

33:22.324 --> 33:25.747
You adopted children
from the original team.

33:25.789 --> 33:26.814
Vista and Ansel.

33:26.856 --> 33:28.882
Yes, that's correct.

33:28.924 --> 33:31.049
But not Maya,
she was an adult already.

33:31.091 --> 33:33.227
No, we hired Maya.

33:33.269 --> 33:35.361
And why was that?

33:35.403 --> 33:37.429
Well, Meredith.

33:37.471 --> 33:38.760
Because the team
would be required

33:38.802 --> 33:40.597
to travel from the
highest mountain

33:40.639 --> 33:42.533
to the deepest ocean,

33:42.575 --> 33:44.964
we realized that some
adult supervision

33:45.006 --> 33:48.737
might be necessary
on certain missions.

33:48.779 --> 33:50.211
And when I met Maya,

33:50.253 --> 33:51.971
she was a very
responsible young woman

33:52.013 --> 33:55.073
and I knew she would fit in
very well with the children.

33:55.115 --> 33:57.911
Now when you were replacing
the original children,

33:57.953 --> 34:01.618
you mentioned the concept
of using robots instead.

34:01.660 --> 34:02.685
Yes.

34:02.727 --> 34:03.950
I was noodling on robots.

34:03.992 --> 34:06.091
But you know, in the end,

34:07.666 --> 34:11.429
to be a Hyperion one must
have heart and compassion.

34:11.472 --> 34:14.433
And of course,
robots can't replace

34:14.475 --> 34:17.542
the soul required
to be on this team.

34:19.545 --> 34:22.001
Well, Professor,
there were many groups

34:22.043 --> 34:24.168
who read into that
original desire

34:24.210 --> 34:26.808
to use robots as a
sign that perhaps

34:26.850 --> 34:29.745
there were more problems
under the surface of the team

34:29.786 --> 34:31.978
than were being revealed to us.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.748
Is that accurate?

34:33.791 --> 34:34.592
Problems?

34:35.793 --> 34:37.324
I can't think of any.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.864
Hello.

34:45.065 --> 34:46.960
Sorry to interrupt.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.567
Professor, we have
a bit of a problem.

34:49.609 --> 34:50.601
What?

34:50.643 --> 34:51.371
A problem.

34:51.413 --> 34:52.438
Oh gosh.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.803
I do beg your pardon, but,

34:54.844 --> 34:56.310
Problems?

34:56.351 --> 34:59.676
Not really, just late
for an appointment.

34:59.718 --> 35:00.908
So sorry.

35:00.950 --> 35:03.680
Thank you.

36:05.454 --> 36:08.008
Hyperion Hall,
known throughout the world

36:08.050 --> 36:11.385
as the headquarters of the
world famous superhero team.

36:11.427 --> 36:13.717
Behind the walls of
this elegant structure,

36:13.759 --> 36:15.389
world leaders have
sought the assistance

36:15.431 --> 36:17.149
of the Hyperions.

36:17.191 --> 36:18.920
It is also, however, the home

36:18.962 --> 36:21.461
where Professor Mandulbaum
has raised his children.

36:21.503 --> 36:23.925
And like millions of
fathers around the world,

36:23.967 --> 36:26.257
Professor Mandulbaum
has had his fair share

36:26.299 --> 36:28.061
of challenges bringing
up his children

36:28.103 --> 36:29.267
Ansel and Vista.

36:30.974 --> 36:33.297
Who can forget the
public rebellions

36:33.339 --> 36:35.442
of his often disobedient Vista?

36:35.484 --> 36:38.577
After several very public
attempts at running away,

36:38.619 --> 36:41.547
young Vista in her most
rebellious act of all

36:41.589 --> 36:43.450
publicly condemned the Professor

36:43.492 --> 36:45.111
on the eve of her
ill-conceived wedding

36:45.153 --> 36:48.048
to Wes Harrison, the
Andy Warhol superstar

36:48.090 --> 36:50.985
and former television
child actor.

36:51.027 --> 36:54.252
In spite of the Professor's
unconditional support and love,

36:54.294 --> 36:56.122
Vista abandoned the family

36:56.164 --> 36:57.992
leaving millions of
concerned citizens

36:58.034 --> 37:01.094
wondering if the team they
had come to love and rely on

37:01.136 --> 37:03.965
was on the brink of collapse.

37:04.007 --> 37:06.968
But Professor Mandulbaum
saw an opportunity,

37:07.010 --> 37:10.334
an opportunity to refresh the
team that had grown stale.

37:10.376 --> 37:12.578
And so after releasing Ansel,

37:12.620 --> 37:15.174
the Professor introduced the
world to three new youths,

37:15.216 --> 37:18.342
leaving Maya to
train the newcomers.

37:18.384 --> 37:21.653
Every few years, the Hyperions
will retire the old class

37:21.695 --> 37:23.017
and welcome the new,

37:23.059 --> 37:25.690
thus ensuring continued
safety for the human race

37:25.732 --> 37:28.088
for generations to come.

37:28.130 --> 37:29.958
In the famous words
of the Professor,

37:30.000 --> 37:31.960
"May we forget the
mistakes of our past

37:32.002 --> 37:34.666
and look with anticipation
to the future.

37:34.708 --> 37:38.072
Leave behind the old
and embrace the new."

37:54.057 --> 37:55.049
Grab a pen.

37:55.091 --> 37:57.828
You're about to
make a statement.

38:02.263 --> 38:03.893
It's Vista and Ansel.

38:03.935 --> 38:05.862
They've taken hostages.

38:05.904 --> 38:08.102
Vista and Ansel?

38:11.239 --> 38:12.836
I spoke to her, Ruckus.

38:12.878 --> 38:14.101
Face to face.

38:14.143 --> 38:16.946
I bet she talked him into it.

38:19.115 --> 38:20.173
Do the police know it's them?

38:20.215 --> 38:21.746
I don't think they
know about Ansel

38:21.788 --> 38:24.144
but they did see her.

38:24.186 --> 38:25.816
In uniform.

38:25.858 --> 38:27.246
In uniform?

38:27.288 --> 38:30.018
Oh, that's just great.

38:30.060 --> 38:32.020
That's just great, that's
just be-loody marvelous.

38:32.062 --> 38:33.461
Ruckus, Vista needs you.

38:33.503 --> 38:35.188
Oh, I bet she does.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.295
I bet she does!

38:38.068 --> 38:39.665
The problem is, Maya,

38:39.707 --> 38:42.030
and you can correct me if I'm
wrong, even though I'm not.

38:42.072 --> 38:43.262
I seem to remember
her telling me

38:43.304 --> 38:45.165
she never wants to see me again.

38:45.207 --> 38:47.772
- Ever.
- She wouldn't tell me what was going on.

38:47.814 --> 38:49.202
Can't you see what
she's trying to do?

38:49.244 --> 38:51.006
She's trying to destroy me!

38:51.048 --> 38:52.513
She's in trouble.

38:52.555 --> 38:55.109
Yes, that's a great way
to ask for help, isn't it?

38:55.151 --> 38:56.755
Taking hostages.

38:57.626 --> 38:59.080
Wait.

39:08.065 --> 39:10.058
These are how she's
been asking for help.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.796
I thought I told you
to get rid of those.

39:11.838 --> 39:13.567
You're making such
a mess in here.

39:13.609 --> 39:15.602
Akiko just cleaned!

39:15.644 --> 39:17.164
Every month she writes
you another letter.

39:17.206 --> 39:18.869
The least you could
do is read one.

39:18.911 --> 39:21.102
I don't need to read them.

39:21.144 --> 39:22.400
I know what's in them.

39:22.442 --> 39:24.809
They're probably just
asking for more money.

39:24.851 --> 39:26.811
Why can't you
just let that go?

39:26.853 --> 39:28.241
She was upset.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.748
Of course she's upset.

39:29.790 --> 39:32.245
Ripped from an orphanage,
dragged to a beautiful mansion

39:32.287 --> 39:35.281
where there's, what's this?

39:35.323 --> 39:37.085
Caviar, open trays of caviar

39:37.127 --> 39:39.417
all over the house,
I mean who has that?

39:39.459 --> 39:40.568
Hmm?

39:41.370 --> 39:43.487
I mean that's a
little off, but still.

39:43.529 --> 39:45.797
Forced to have
super powers, fame.

39:45.839 --> 39:48.195
Maybe she doesn't care
about the powers and fame.

39:48.237 --> 39:51.099
Who doesn't care
about power and fame?

39:51.141 --> 39:53.805
I mean what is she,
some kind of an alien?

39:53.847 --> 39:56.302
I mean what more can I give?

39:56.344 --> 39:58.850
All I do is give, give, give.

40:00.887 --> 40:04.350
And who's on my side
at the end of the day?

40:05.595 --> 40:07.148
I am.

40:07.190 --> 40:08.321
Nobody.

40:09.797 --> 40:11.665
- I wanna see the cork.
- Hmm?

40:13.493 --> 40:14.393
The cork.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.033
You have it, right?

40:18.300 --> 40:19.996
Yes.

40:20.038 --> 40:22.236
I'll never show it to you.

40:24.339 --> 40:27.135
You don't lie to me, Ruckus.

40:27.177 --> 40:30.072
Maya!

40:30.114 --> 40:31.711
Oh, sod it.

40:31.753 --> 40:33.082
What did I say?

40:33.755 --> 40:34.754
Maya!

40:36.186 --> 40:37.020
Maya?

40:40.190 --> 40:42.150
God, I do wish you'd
stop rushing off,

40:42.192 --> 40:45.567
you know how I hate
chasing you like this.

40:49.199 --> 40:50.730
Why are you packing?

40:50.772 --> 40:52.963
Are you going somewhere?

40:53.005 --> 40:55.636
How long have you been
lying about the cork?

40:55.678 --> 40:58.232
Do you know how dangerous
that could have been?

40:58.274 --> 40:59.838
What if it fell into
the wrong hands?

40:59.880 --> 41:02.236
Well, it didn't.

41:02.278 --> 41:03.534
Bugger.

41:03.576 --> 41:05.404
Vista said
something today.

41:05.446 --> 41:07.747
It really got me
thinking, Ruckus.

41:07.789 --> 41:09.591
Do share the wisdom.

41:11.793 --> 41:14.479
Can't wait to hear this one.

41:14.521 --> 41:16.217
I'm sure it's a real doozy.

41:17.227 --> 41:18.549
She said you loved the team,

41:18.591 --> 41:20.129
not the people on it.

41:21.803 --> 41:25.200
You don't really
believe that, do you?

41:26.742 --> 41:29.934
I'm not sure what I
believe anymore, Ruckus.

41:31.307 --> 41:33.531
All I know is that I'm tired.

41:33.573 --> 41:36.171
I'm tired of saying
goodbye to people I love.

41:36.213 --> 41:39.713
I'm tired of the fight and
I'm tired of the burden.

41:39.755 --> 41:41.044
Ah.

41:41.086 --> 41:41.946
There you are.

41:41.988 --> 41:43.145
I'm tired of taking sides.

41:45.959 --> 41:48.553
I'm tired of you disappearing.

41:53.769 --> 41:54.966
Look!

41:56.266 --> 41:59.399
I really didn't mean
to rattle your cage.

42:07.475 --> 42:10.304
Would you at least have
the decency to stay-

42:12.513 --> 42:14.480
Ruckus, look at me.

42:15.483 --> 42:17.311
This isn't just about
the cork, Ruckus.

42:17.353 --> 42:19.049
It's about us, all of us.

42:19.091 --> 42:21.788
I wish you would just say
what it is you want to say.

42:22.798 --> 42:25.319
I understand Vista hurt you.

42:25.361 --> 42:27.130
I know you're scared.

42:28.496 --> 42:30.060
I know you loved those two kids

42:30.102 --> 42:33.261
and I know why you dismissed
Ansel when she left.

42:33.303 --> 42:36.737
But Ruckus, I'm not sure
they know how you feel.

42:36.779 --> 42:41.170
Every penny I spent
should have told them.

42:41.212 --> 42:43.403
The PR team said I
had to start fresh

42:43.445 --> 42:45.141
with whole new Hyperions.

42:45.183 --> 42:47.051
What choice did I have?

42:50.254 --> 42:52.346
Like it or not,
you formed a family.

42:52.388 --> 42:55.620
You have two children
and you have me.

42:56.997 --> 43:01.124
We've never understood
where we stand, Ruckus.

43:01.166 --> 43:02.660
What are we to you?

43:03.465 --> 43:04.706
What am I?

43:05.907 --> 43:07.559
Professor?

43:07.601 --> 43:09.000
Yes?

43:09.042 --> 43:10.430
What is it?

43:10.472 --> 43:12.333
I've just received word
that we're about to hear

43:12.375 --> 43:14.302
a prepared statement
from one of the culprits

43:14.344 --> 43:16.535
in the museum hostage situation.

43:16.577 --> 43:17.778
Again, ladies and gentlemen,

43:17.820 --> 43:19.208
this is going to be live.

43:38.071 --> 43:40.005
And five, four, three.

43:47.047 --> 43:49.410
My name is Vista Mandulbaum.

43:54.351 --> 43:56.120
My brother Ansel and I

43:57.992 --> 44:00.091
have taken four hostages.

44:01.259 --> 44:03.615
We've come for one thing,

44:03.657 --> 44:05.749
our Titan Badges.

44:05.791 --> 44:08.356
The badges are currently
locked in a case

44:08.398 --> 44:11.773
that only Professor
Mandulbaum can unlock.

44:12.798 --> 44:14.934
Nobody will leave this building

44:14.976 --> 44:17.273
until we have those badges.

44:19.178 --> 44:21.204
Well.

44:21.246 --> 44:24.504
That appears to be all we're going to be
hearing from the scene, so in summation,

44:24.546 --> 44:26.572
from what we've just heard live,

44:26.614 --> 44:29.384
Professor, what do you think?

44:30.585 --> 44:31.617
Yeah.

44:32.994 --> 44:35.456
At least we know where we stand.

44:37.460 --> 44:39.222
Dice, you
get to roll first.

44:39.264 --> 44:40.487
All right.

44:40.529 --> 44:42.456
So everyone gets
a pack of cards.

44:42.498 --> 44:43.589
That's for you.

44:43.631 --> 44:44.997
Thanks.

44:45.039 --> 44:48.528
And you get to choose
whoever you wanna be, yeah.

44:48.570 --> 44:50.365
Was spotted
over the eastern seaboard.

44:50.407 --> 44:51.872
Well, it's
difficult to see

44:51.914 --> 44:53.335
through the
tremendous smoke here

44:53.377 --> 44:55.535
on the streets, but
I believe, I see yes!

44:55.577 --> 44:58.637
Ladies and gentlemen, I
could see Ansel Mandulbaum.

44:58.679 --> 45:00.507
He's carrying, he's
emerging from the haze

45:00.549 --> 45:02.146
and he's carrying,

45:02.188 --> 45:03.675
oh I can't believe
what I'm seeing.

45:03.717 --> 45:06.579
He's carrying the
missile above his head!

45:06.621 --> 45:08.955
Ansel Mandulbaum
has saved us all!

45:08.997 --> 45:10.550
He stopped the missile!

45:10.592 --> 45:12.585
Ansel has saved countless lives

45:12.627 --> 45:15.423
and I have never seen
such a display of heroism

45:15.465 --> 45:17.722
and self-sacrifice
in all my life.

45:17.764 --> 45:20.461
Ansel Mandulbaum, the
Hyperion super team

45:20.503 --> 45:22.727
has caught a rogue
soviet missile.

45:22.769 --> 45:24.663
The crowd is cheering.

45:24.705 --> 45:27.072
What a moment to
witness in person.

45:27.114 --> 45:28.436
Citizens are in tears

45:28.478 --> 45:31.945
and they are reaching out
to thank the young hero.

45:58.178 --> 45:59.705
Hey, Mr. Ansel?

46:02.545 --> 46:04.677
You wanna get in on this?

46:06.384 --> 46:08.872
I'm hot, I'm tired,
this is like flying coach.

46:08.914 --> 46:10.214
- Oh, new player.
- Here you go,

46:10.256 --> 46:11.215
here are your blue cards.

46:11.257 --> 46:12.018
Hey, all right.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.547
You get to roll first.

46:13.589 --> 46:15.989
But first you have
to choose a guy

46:16.031 --> 46:19.619
from the characters
left in this box.

46:19.661 --> 46:21.357
Did someone take Ansel?

46:21.399 --> 46:23.392
I did, I'm Ansel.

46:23.434 --> 46:26.692
I hope you don't have
a problem with that.

46:26.734 --> 46:30.696
I was kinda hoping
I could be Ansel.

46:30.738 --> 46:33.633
Hey, look, let's
see who's in here?

46:33.675 --> 46:34.872
Okay, look there!

46:36.546 --> 46:38.737
Here's Ares, you could be him.

46:38.779 --> 46:41.575
He's pretty neat, he's blue.

46:41.617 --> 46:43.412
Yeah, yeah.

46:43.454 --> 46:45.315
- That's fine, yeah, yeah.
- Great, that's okay?

46:45.357 --> 46:47.185
Okay good, okay good, let's go.

46:47.227 --> 46:49.187
- All right, so.
- Were you there?

46:59.371 --> 47:01.562
Can we all focus here?

47:01.604 --> 47:03.597
Ant, can we all
focus for a minute?

47:03.639 --> 47:06.699
Ansel is supposed
to roll the dice.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.906
I don't feel like playing.

47:14.155 --> 47:15.543
Okay, that
was very dramatic.

47:15.585 --> 47:17.215
Okay well he
seemed kinda upset.

47:17.257 --> 47:18.117
You were bullying him.

47:18.159 --> 47:19.745
Don't put it on me.

47:19.787 --> 47:23.287
I think he has some
emotional issues.

47:44.647 --> 47:46.482
What'd I do wrong?

47:47.419 --> 47:48.682
No, no.

47:49.017 --> 47:50.908
You haven't done anything wrong.

47:50.950 --> 47:54.120
Well, that's
not entirely true.

47:54.162 --> 47:56.980
We did warn you about
seeing Vista, Ansel.

47:57.022 --> 47:58.619
I missed her.

47:58.661 --> 48:00.357
She just wanted to talk.

48:00.399 --> 48:03.459
But didn't we tell you
not to talk to her, Ansel?

48:03.501 --> 48:05.593
She wants to ruin the team.

48:05.635 --> 48:07.727
Dad, I'm sorry I saw Vista.

48:07.769 --> 48:09.234
But I wanna stay.

48:09.276 --> 48:12.336
My boy, you've
done a grand job.

48:12.378 --> 48:14.378
Maybe it's for the best.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.341
Now you can be free to
think of all the things

48:17.383 --> 48:18.738
that you would like to do,

48:18.780 --> 48:21.411
like what would you like
to be when you grow up?

48:21.453 --> 48:23.090
This, I like this.

48:24.192 --> 48:28.583
Well,
the team just feels,

48:28.625 --> 48:30.849
we all feel that
perhaps it's time

48:30.891 --> 48:35.326
for someone else to take
on the responsibility.

48:35.368 --> 48:36.624
Do I have to move out?

48:36.666 --> 48:38.758
Of course not.

48:40.736 --> 48:45.171
Well I'm sure we can secure
you a wonderful place nearby.

48:45.213 --> 48:48.643
So you can visit as
often as you'd like.

49:00.822 --> 49:02.485
My point is,

49:04.023 --> 49:06.430
if you need someone to talk,

49:08.929 --> 49:10.724
I'd be more than
happy to volunteer.

49:10.766 --> 49:13.404
Yeah I'll keep that in mind.

49:40.598 --> 49:42.690
Everybody stay here.

49:58.880 --> 50:00.121
Stop right there!

50:14.093 --> 50:15.822
Is he
SWAT or something?

50:15.864 --> 50:17.230
He's not a cop.

50:17.272 --> 50:18.832
Are you?

50:20.440 --> 50:22.598
What
happened to you?

50:22.640 --> 50:24.765
He kicked me in my chest.

50:24.807 --> 50:27.768
Broke the pen in my shirt.

50:27.810 --> 50:29.073
My brand new pen.

50:30.142 --> 50:32.153
But who is he?

50:33.585 --> 50:34.940
Don't give me that.

50:34.982 --> 50:36.744
He's yours, isn't he?

50:36.786 --> 50:39.252
How did he get in here?

50:39.294 --> 50:41.947
When will
I have the badges?

50:45.333 --> 50:47.432
You're in the building.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.900
I wanna talk to Ruby.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.336
First you
deliver the badges.

50:57.378 --> 50:59.477
No, you put her on now.

51:03.681 --> 51:05.010
Mommy?

51:08.180 --> 51:09.190
Hi, honey.

51:10.853 --> 51:11.951
Are you okay?

51:13.526 --> 51:15.394
Where are you?

51:17.926 --> 51:21.624
Mommy's just picking
something up for you.

51:21.666 --> 51:23.204
I'll be right there.

51:26.165 --> 51:28.796
I'm coming to get you.

51:28.838 --> 51:30.002
Okay.

51:34.844 --> 51:37.108
Are they being nice to you?

51:39.244 --> 51:41.479
Are you watching TV?

51:41.521 --> 51:43.316
I'm losing my patience.

51:43.358 --> 51:45.813
You have 30 minutes to
get me those badges.

52:29.228 --> 52:30.403
You're here.

53:16.143 --> 53:21.146
Ah, good evening
everyone.

53:22.787 --> 53:23.911
Let's greet the fans.

53:23.953 --> 53:25.451
- Mhmm.
- And then straight up to Vista.

53:25.493 --> 53:27.387
Right, will do.

53:27.429 --> 53:29.114
Ah, hello, hello, how are you,

53:29.156 --> 53:30.555
nice to meet you, hello.

53:30.597 --> 53:31.556
Are they treating you well here?

53:31.598 --> 53:32.887
Very well, thank you.

53:32.929 --> 53:34.152
- Professor, Alvin Delano.
- Hello, hello.

53:34.194 --> 53:35.560
I'm the curator.

53:35.602 --> 53:36.528
Ah, yes, yes.

53:36.570 --> 53:37.859
All your creations here.

53:37.901 --> 53:39.564
Quite the stain
you've got there.

53:39.606 --> 53:40.730
Yes, exploding pen.

53:40.772 --> 53:41.962
Hi
Professor, I'm Sarah.

53:42.004 --> 53:43.029
I own the paper.

53:43.071 --> 53:44.470
I have this book
that I used to know.

53:44.512 --> 53:46.571
Oh yes yes of course.

53:46.613 --> 53:48.298
What are you gonna say?

53:48.340 --> 53:50.971
Just that we need
his thumbprint.

53:51.013 --> 53:52.170
Mr. Professor,
would you please

53:52.212 --> 53:53.479
- sign this for me?
- Yes?

53:53.521 --> 53:54.942
Ah, oh, what's this?

53:54.984 --> 53:56.548
It's you,
a mask of you.

53:56.590 --> 53:57.879
Really?

53:57.921 --> 53:59.584
Ha, doesn't really look
like me.

53:59.626 --> 54:01.850
Eh, it's pretty close.

54:01.892 --> 54:04.497
You gonna tell him about Ruby?

54:12.771 --> 54:14.027
Ready?

54:14.069 --> 54:16.359
Yes, I suppose so.

54:16.401 --> 54:19.329
I must say, the hostages seem
pretty upbeat, don't you?

54:19.371 --> 54:20.711
Unnaturally so.

54:23.342 --> 54:24.341
What's this?

54:35.695 --> 54:37.057
Ah, there you are.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.065
Congratulations, Vista.

54:46.068 --> 54:47.962
It's a real fine mess
you've gotten yourself

54:48.004 --> 54:49.069
and Ansel into.

54:50.875 --> 54:52.736
I gotta keep an eye on
those people out there.

54:52.778 --> 54:55.838
Wait, wait, don't
you mean hostages?

54:55.880 --> 54:57.543
I think that's what you
call people you hold

54:57.585 --> 54:58.544
against their will.

55:01.886 --> 55:06.988
You do realize that armed
robbery is a felony, don't you?

55:08.024 --> 55:09.181
You have any idea of the strings

55:09.223 --> 55:09.951
I'm gonna have to pull?

55:11.896 --> 55:14.824
To get you out of this mess, hm?

55:14.866 --> 55:16.155
I'll watch them.

55:16.197 --> 55:17.420
No, you stay right here, Maya.

55:17.462 --> 55:18.762
Why does she have to be here?

55:18.804 --> 55:20.665
I don't know, why does
Ansel have to be here?

55:20.707 --> 55:22.062
Because he's my
partner in this.

55:22.104 --> 55:23.195
Oh, please.

55:23.237 --> 55:25.138
It's true.

55:33.720 --> 55:36.314
That doesn't
sound like my boy.

55:37.383 --> 55:38.492
Not my Ansel.

55:44.632 --> 55:45.763
Is it true?

55:47.228 --> 55:48.451
What?

55:48.493 --> 55:51.454
That you're half to
blame for this mess?

55:51.496 --> 55:53.258
Maya, would you do me a favor

55:53.300 --> 55:55.964
and escort Ansel outside
for a moment please?

55:56.006 --> 55:57.137
Fine.

55:59.438 --> 56:02.234
Shouldn't I at least
stay to help explain?

56:02.276 --> 56:03.202
It's okay.

56:03.244 --> 56:05.277
I'll meet you outside.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.020
- 15 years and
- Of course the first thing

56:19.062 --> 56:21.220
- that comes out of your mouth is about you.
- Nothing has changed.

56:21.262 --> 56:23.222
- You're still just a spoiled
- You think the whole world

56:23.264 --> 56:24.960
- revolves around you!
- Little child!

56:25.002 --> 56:27.259
- Money, money...
- You have everything anyone could want to have.

56:27.301 --> 56:29.294
You won't be satisfied
until you've burned...

56:29.336 --> 56:31.637
Fixate on the one time someone didn't
fall on your stupid precious little line.

56:31.679 --> 56:34.581
You're still a spoiled
little child!

56:38.785 --> 56:41.614
It's good to see you, Ansel.

56:41.656 --> 56:42.648
Really?

56:42.690 --> 56:44.316
Yeah, of course.

56:45.319 --> 56:46.725
I've missed you.

56:47.992 --> 56:51.151
Things aren't the
same without you.

56:51.193 --> 56:52.995
I've missed you too.

56:58.739 --> 57:01.260
Are you still in Detroit?

57:01.302 --> 57:03.676
No, I moved a few years ago.

57:06.373 --> 57:09.873
Now I'm living with
Vista, actually.

57:09.915 --> 57:11.013
Oh, really?

57:12.753 --> 57:15.043
Haven't you been
receiving our checks?

57:15.085 --> 57:16.183
I have.

57:19.485 --> 57:22.189
You're sharing
them with Vista.

57:25.260 --> 57:26.358
She needs me.

57:27.394 --> 57:28.767
Her and Ruby both.

57:30.595 --> 57:31.704
Who's Ruby?

57:33.367 --> 57:35.393
You're spoiled
and you're selfish!

57:35.435 --> 57:38.165
You have any idea
what you've done?!

57:38.207 --> 57:41.201
You and your stupid persona.

57:41.243 --> 57:43.467
I beg your pardon?

57:43.509 --> 57:46.041
You don't even know when you're on television
anymore. You can't tell the difference.

57:46.083 --> 57:49.887
Have I ever met the real
Ruckus Mandulbaum anyway?

57:53.959 --> 57:55.420
I know who I am.

57:56.588 --> 57:59.549
I don't have to
prove it to anyone.

57:59.591 --> 58:01.228
Least of all, you.

58:04.233 --> 58:06.732
But you want your
little badge, don't you?

58:06.774 --> 58:09.867
You always get what you want.

58:09.909 --> 58:11.297
That's her.

58:11.339 --> 58:12.536
That's Ruby Red.

58:13.847 --> 58:16.841
Why didn't Vista tell
us she had a daughter?

58:16.883 --> 58:18.106
How old is she?

58:18.148 --> 58:19.818
She's five.

58:21.250 --> 58:22.539
Want them so badly?

58:22.581 --> 58:24.079
You think these
little bits of plastic

58:24.121 --> 58:25.278
will bring you happiness?

58:25.320 --> 58:27.280
Fine, they're all yours,
whatever you want.

58:27.322 --> 58:28.754
That's all I've
been asking for.

58:28.796 --> 58:32.054
Give, give, give,
that's all I ever do.

58:32.096 --> 58:33.693
And we have an audience.

58:33.735 --> 58:35.801
Let the grand show begin.

58:45.813 --> 58:47.142
It's all yours.

58:59.794 --> 59:01.057
Well?

59:02.390 --> 59:04.698
Aren't you gonna put it on?

59:32.893 --> 59:34.156
It's a decoy.

59:36.996 --> 59:38.127
It's a decoy?

59:39.526 --> 59:41.860
Well of course it's a decoy.

59:41.902 --> 59:44.489
You don't actually think
I'd allow the real badges

59:44.531 --> 59:48.841
to be out in the open in a
traveling exhibit, do you?

59:51.538 --> 59:52.746
Dad, please.

01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:03.218
It's Dad now, is it?

01:00:05.156 --> 01:00:09.184
Ladies and gentlemen, I do
apologize for the delay.

01:00:09.226 --> 01:00:10.482
This'll all be over momentarily.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.550
In the meantime,
please help yourselves

01:00:12.592 --> 01:00:14.486
to some Hyperion juice boxes

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:16.356
from the gift store.

01:00:16.398 --> 01:00:17.720
You don't understand.

01:00:17.762 --> 01:00:19.491
I understand when
I'm being manipulated.

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:20.800
Ruckus, stop!

01:00:20.842 --> 01:00:22.494
Maya, they're
making me do this.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.364
Enough
of this nonsense.

01:00:24.406 --> 01:00:25.596
Ansel, you can come with us.

01:00:28.212 --> 01:00:29.336
Dad, you need to listen.

01:00:29.378 --> 01:00:30.843
Ruckus, hear them out.

01:00:30.885 --> 01:00:33.241
I've heard all I need to hear.

01:00:33.283 --> 01:00:35.111
You can't leave us!

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.153
They have my daughter!

01:00:40.455 --> 01:00:42.587
Did you say daughter?

01:00:47.429 --> 01:00:48.395
Ruckus.

01:00:57.439 --> 01:00:58.636
Hmm.

01:00:59.305 --> 01:01:01.573
What an adorable little girl.

01:01:03.808 --> 01:01:08.408
Tell me, is she a friend's
kid or a union actress?

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.509
Because if she has talent,

01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:14.612
I may be able to use her
in an upcoming episode.

01:01:14.654 --> 01:01:18.491
Do you honestly think
I would lie about this?

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.936
I've seen you do worse.

01:01:44.992 --> 01:01:46.189
Don't do this.

01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:48.862
Put it in the case.

01:02:25.395 --> 01:02:27.619
I hope it makes you happy.

01:02:37.572 --> 01:02:41.706
I knew you'd end up abusing
the power I gave you.

01:02:46.284 --> 01:02:48.581
Baby, what are you doing?

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:51.056
Let's go.

01:02:53.962 --> 01:02:56.094
Don't even listen to him.

01:02:56.921 --> 01:02:58.162
It's ours.

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:19.348
Now you haven't
given me anything.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.448
- Sir?
- Hmm?

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:46.779
What's
the situation?

01:06:46.821 --> 01:06:49.386
Well there's nothing
more I can do in there.

01:06:49.428 --> 01:06:53.522
So I suggest you go in and
resolve it your way, Captain.

01:06:53.564 --> 01:06:54.655
No, hold that.

01:06:54.697 --> 01:06:56.459
Ruckus, wait.

01:06:56.501 --> 01:06:57.955
Captain, it's a bit
more complicated

01:06:57.997 --> 01:06:59.429
than we expected in there.

01:06:59.471 --> 01:07:01.761
Can you please be
patient and hold off?

01:07:01.803 --> 01:07:04.632
Have the negotiator call
and tell Vista we'll be back

01:07:04.674 --> 01:07:05.930
within the hour.

01:07:05.972 --> 01:07:07.239
Right away, ma'am.

01:07:07.281 --> 01:07:08.768
Nobody enter that
building until we return.

01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:11.177
- Captain!
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07:11.219 --> 01:07:12.805
Oh, Miss Maya?

01:07:12.847 --> 01:07:16.079
We just received
this message for you.

01:07:18.149 --> 01:07:19.614
Professor?

01:07:19.656 --> 01:07:20.912
Hmm?

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:22.254
Professor, I'm needed
at the White House.

01:07:22.296 --> 01:07:23.915
Can you just go
home and stay there,

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:24.784
we'll talk when I'm back.

01:07:24.826 --> 01:07:25.752
I'm not gonna be long.

01:07:25.794 --> 01:07:26.786
Fine.

01:07:26.828 --> 01:07:28.260
Just teleport me
back to the office

01:07:28.302 --> 01:07:30.790
and then you can read the
President his bedtime story.

01:07:30.832 --> 01:07:32.022
You're not going
anywhere with me.

01:07:32.064 --> 01:07:35.025
You acted like a
stubborn ass back there.

01:07:35.067 --> 01:07:38.303
Well how am I
supposed to get home?

01:07:38.345 --> 01:07:40.602
I had the car brought
here, I'll find you a driver.

01:07:41.843 --> 01:07:44.573
Well what happened
to my driver?

01:07:45.946 --> 01:07:47.477
Ah, for God's sake.

01:07:47.519 --> 01:07:50.172
To heck with it all,
I'll drive myself.

01:07:50.214 --> 01:07:51.356
Ruckus!

01:07:51.886 --> 01:07:53.142
Captain!

01:07:53.184 --> 01:07:55.353
The Professor's never
driven a car before.

01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:56.816
Can you find someone to
drive him home, please?

01:07:56.858 --> 01:07:57.850
On it.

01:07:57.892 --> 01:07:58.653
Thank you.

01:08:04.272 --> 01:08:05.832
That man will do.

01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:50.415
Time's up.

01:08:58.953 --> 01:09:00.517
Excuse me.

01:09:00.559 --> 01:09:02.178
Would you mind picking a station

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.917
and sticking to it please?

01:09:06.091 --> 01:09:07.300
Thank you.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.130
Oh, what a day, what a day.

01:09:48.837 --> 01:09:51.634
What are you looking at, hmm?

01:09:51.676 --> 01:09:53.379
Like you're so brave.

01:09:55.647 --> 01:09:57.904
Wanna know what kind
of a day I've had?

01:09:57.946 --> 01:09:59.037
I'll tell you.

01:09:59.079 --> 01:10:01.072
I'm a grandfather.

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:02.414
Vista has a daughter.

01:10:02.456 --> 01:10:03.448
Suit up for adventure!

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:04.482
Hmm?

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:06.150
Oh, you wanna see?

01:10:09.628 --> 01:10:10.627
There.

01:10:12.158 --> 01:10:13.124
Yes.

01:10:18.769 --> 01:10:20.032
All the badges.

01:10:21.332 --> 01:10:25.235
They want all the badges to
release my granddaughter.

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:04.509
Your life's work.

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:06.914
Yes, yes it is.

01:11:08.214 --> 01:11:10.522
How can you give them away?

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.061
You can't destroy them.

01:11:24.065 --> 01:11:26.223
What choice do I have?

01:11:26.265 --> 01:11:28.199
What else can be done?

01:11:33.173 --> 01:11:34.414
No, this won't do.

01:11:35.978 --> 01:11:38.070
This won't do at all.

01:11:39.982 --> 01:11:41.513
- Sir?
- Hmm?

01:11:41.555 --> 01:11:43.306
Miss Maya insisted that
you stayed at Hyperion Hall

01:11:43.348 --> 01:11:45.044
until her return.

01:11:45.086 --> 01:11:46.375
Tell me.

01:11:46.417 --> 01:11:48.080
How long have you worked for me?

01:11:48.122 --> 01:11:50.016
Oh, 10 years, Professor.

01:11:50.058 --> 01:11:52.920
And in those 10 years
have you ever known me

01:11:52.962 --> 01:11:55.692
not to do whatever I wanted?

01:11:55.734 --> 01:11:56.898
No, sir.

01:11:57.967 --> 01:12:00.895
Although I do appreciate
your concern, Lucy.

01:12:00.937 --> 01:12:02.094
I'm Lucy, sir.

01:12:02.136 --> 01:12:03.194
Hmm?

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:06.098
I'm Lucy
and she's Marian.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.238
Right, yes.

01:12:08.142 --> 01:12:09.680
Yes, I knew that.

01:12:45.278 --> 01:12:49.115
Ah, okay, right.

01:12:50.316 --> 01:12:52.492
Evening, Professor.

01:12:54.452 --> 01:12:55.451
Hmm, Ares.

01:12:58.027 --> 01:13:00.526
Well, well, well, I
should have guessed.

01:13:00.568 --> 01:13:01.659
We were beginning to wonder

01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:04.090
if you were ever coming back.

01:13:04.132 --> 01:13:05.454
I could be mistaken but I think

01:13:05.496 --> 01:13:07.566
this may be your first
time in a room with a gun.

01:13:07.608 --> 01:13:10.334
Yes, you might be
right about that.

01:13:11.744 --> 01:13:15.233
So.

01:13:15.275 --> 01:13:16.432
Kidnapping eh?

01:13:16.474 --> 01:13:19.171
I learned from the best.

01:13:19.213 --> 01:13:21.008
Oh it's amazing what
other people's kids

01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:22.746
can get done for you.

01:13:22.788 --> 01:13:23.853
Isn't it?

01:13:24.722 --> 01:13:27.179
Yes, well I'm not
entirely sure what it is

01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:29.181
you've gotten done here.

01:13:29.223 --> 01:13:30.820
Oh, I've gotten
the world famous

01:13:30.862 --> 01:13:33.592
Professor Mandulbaum to
hand deliver my Titan Badge.

01:13:33.634 --> 01:13:35.418
Oh, I have it, yes.

01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:37.387
I think I'll take it now.

01:13:37.429 --> 01:13:42.300
No, no,
no, I don't think so.

01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:44.295
He doesn't get it, does he?

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.099
He doesn't understand
what it's like.

01:13:46.141 --> 01:13:48.530
You triggered something
in us, Professor.

01:13:48.572 --> 01:13:51.137
There's no going back.

01:13:51.179 --> 01:13:53.014
I can't live like them.

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:57.084
Look, Ares.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.882
I want my badge.

01:13:59.924 --> 01:14:02.148
There's nothing more to say.

01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:05.624
Why don't you take
the guns off of them?

01:14:05.666 --> 01:14:07.285
Because if you think
about it logically,

01:14:07.327 --> 01:14:09.122
they're really in
the same boat as you.

01:14:09.164 --> 01:14:11.091
I still need them.

01:14:11.133 --> 01:14:12.928
You think I'm stupid?

01:14:12.970 --> 01:14:14.523
I can't just steal my own badge.

01:14:14.565 --> 01:14:15.865
Then what?

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:17.427
Live the rest of
my life in hiding

01:14:17.469 --> 01:14:20.705
knowing the whole
world is after me?

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:25.072
It's no secret how you feel
about Vista, Professor.

01:14:25.114 --> 01:14:27.778
She's the most hated person
in the world 'cause of you.

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.076
If you hadn't seen
it for yourself

01:14:29.118 --> 01:14:30.176
you would have never believed

01:14:30.218 --> 01:14:31.848
she wasn't the one to blame.

01:14:31.890 --> 01:14:34.411
And Ansel, this guy
wants his powers back

01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:36.149
more than anyone.

01:14:36.191 --> 01:14:37.762
His life's pathetic.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.903
A gift
of an old fool.

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:53.272
Look, Ares.

01:14:54.715 --> 01:14:55.674
The badge.

01:14:57.311 --> 01:14:58.783
It's beyond repair.

01:15:01.249 --> 01:15:02.439
Let me see it.

01:15:02.481 --> 01:15:06.087
I'm not sure you
want to, but all right.

01:15:19.201 --> 01:15:20.497
That's all of it.

01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:24.501
Why would you do that?

01:15:26.472 --> 01:15:28.267
Make me another one.

01:15:28.309 --> 01:15:30.137
No.

01:15:30.179 --> 01:15:31.875
I'm afraid that's quite
out of the question.

01:15:31.917 --> 01:15:34.713
You'll make me another one!

01:15:34.755 --> 01:15:37.657
Or I'll kill everyone
in this room!

01:15:38.825 --> 01:15:42.123
You're not going
to kill anyone, Ares.

01:16:30.536 --> 01:16:32.338
When did you get it?

01:16:51.326 --> 01:16:52.490
Wait.

01:16:56.397 --> 01:16:57.554
Okay.

01:16:57.596 --> 01:16:59.193
I think I get it.

01:16:59.235 --> 01:17:00.392
Ooh.

01:17:00.434 --> 01:17:02.460
Shots fired, shots fired!

01:17:02.502 --> 01:17:04.330
Squad A, come with me.

01:17:04.372 --> 01:17:06.035
Squad B, maintain the perimeter,

01:17:06.077 --> 01:17:07.399
keep those people back!

01:17:08.376 --> 01:17:10.138
Goddammit, Garrett, come on.

01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.843
Give me my gun, give me my gun!

01:17:11.885 --> 01:17:13.438
I don't wanna miss the show.

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:14.754
All right.

01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:24.423
Ugh.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.790
Stop, Vista.

01:17:51.683 --> 01:17:53.287
Wait, just wait.

01:17:55.489 --> 01:17:58.087
I would never hurt her.

01:17:58.129 --> 01:17:59.326
You know that.

01:18:00.428 --> 01:18:03.462
I had no choice,
I needed it back.

01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:07.063
Vista, it's him you're angry at.

01:18:07.105 --> 01:18:08.599
It's the Professor!

01:18:11.109 --> 01:18:12.108
He did this.

01:18:24.958 --> 01:18:26.951
Ruby, darling.

01:18:26.993 --> 01:18:29.928
Go in that stall
and lock the door.

01:18:32.625 --> 01:18:34.255
That's it.

01:18:34.297 --> 01:18:37.896
Now, block your ears
and sing our song.

01:18:37.938 --> 01:18:39.696
I'll be right there.

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:26.130
Ansel!

01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:27.237
Hey!

01:21:29.274 --> 01:21:31.340
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:36.602
Wait.

01:21:36.644 --> 01:21:37.669
Where's the Professor?

01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:38.670
Professor?

01:21:38.712 --> 01:21:40.705
- Professor?
- Professor?

01:21:40.747 --> 01:21:41.944
Professor!

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:44.005
Professor!

01:21:44.047 --> 01:21:45.006
Maya!

01:21:45.048 --> 01:21:45.809
Ansel!

01:21:45.851 --> 01:21:47.547
Medic, I need your help.

01:21:47.589 --> 01:21:49.648
Get someone
over here, right away.

01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:51.518
No, no, no, no, no!

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:52.658
No, Dad, Dad.

01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:55.621
I need you
to look over here.

01:21:55.663 --> 01:21:56.794
Stay with me.

01:22:27.761 --> 01:22:29.226
But paramedics
were reportedly seen

01:22:29.268 --> 01:22:31.360
rushing Professor
Ruckus Mandulbaum,

01:22:31.402 --> 01:22:33.494
the world famous leader
of the Hyperions,

01:22:33.536 --> 01:22:35.991
believed to George Washington
University Hospital

01:22:36.033 --> 01:22:38.202
where he remained overnight.

01:22:38.244 --> 01:22:39.962
He is now back at
home in Hyperion Hall,

01:22:40.004 --> 01:22:42.866
recovering where thousands
of fans and supporters

01:22:42.908 --> 01:22:45.000
have gathered to share
their messages of love.

01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:46.382
Sorry, Ansel.

01:22:50.157 --> 01:22:51.387
I have so,

01:22:53.886 --> 01:22:55.589
so many blueprints.

01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:58.981
It's okay.

01:22:59.023 --> 01:23:01.595
No, its not okay.

01:23:02.862 --> 01:23:04.558
Hey, Ruby Red.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.757
Let's give your mom some time

01:23:05.799 --> 01:23:08.364
to talk to granddad, okay?

01:23:08.406 --> 01:23:09.801
All right, come on.

01:23:13.213 --> 01:23:14.311
Bye.

01:23:29.053 --> 01:23:30.195
Hey.

01:23:34.894 --> 01:23:36.927
I don't know what to say.

01:25:12.497 --> 01:25:14.057
I love you too, Dad.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.297
Just like
your parents at home,

01:25:52.339 --> 01:25:55.597
I sometimes need to help
my children fall asleep.

01:25:55.639 --> 01:25:57.797
When counting sheep
doesn't cut the mustard

01:25:57.839 --> 01:26:01.005
for my girl Vista, I
sing her this song.

01:27:02.574 --> 01:27:04.996
Now arriving
at 7th Street Station.

01:27:05.038 --> 01:27:07.097
This is the last
station on the red line.

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:11.042
Please mind your step
upon exiting the train.
