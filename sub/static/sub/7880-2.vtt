00:34.324 --> 00:37.993
Oh, Stan, I can't believe we're
actually going on vacation.

00:38.028 --> 00:40.363
And the resort has so many activities!

00:40.397 --> 00:42.598
Parasailing, snorkeling,

00:42.632 --> 00:45.601
Bellacore Printing Company
East Medford New Jersey...

00:45.635 --> 00:47.870
We can go whale watching!

00:47.904 --> 00:49.338
You ain't doing (bleep) with us.

00:49.373 --> 00:50.639
Mommy?

00:50.674 --> 00:52.892
Your father's been working
nonstop lately,

00:52.926 --> 00:55.361
and he and I are spending
our vacation reconnecting,

00:55.395 --> 00:57.079
alone.

00:57.114 --> 00:58.764
I guess I'll just hang with Jeff then.

00:58.799 --> 01:00.166
No can do.

01:00.200 --> 01:02.768
I'll be spending my time rolling
naked on top of your sister.

01:02.803 --> 01:05.203
See, dude, our sex life
is totally dead.

01:05.238 --> 01:07.273
I'd rather hump a garbage disposal

01:07.307 --> 01:08.941
than crawl up on there one more time.

01:08.975 --> 01:11.911
We're hoping vacation sex
will get us back on track.

01:11.945 --> 01:15.214
This conversation has become
too frank for my liking.

01:15.248 --> 01:17.816
So I guess I'll have fun
with Roger then.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.703
It's been a year since
my husband Omar passed.

01:20.737 --> 01:23.105
I just need to get away
from the apartment.

01:23.140 --> 01:24.790
All those memories.

01:26.226 --> 01:29.328
Oh, God, you're gonna be
this old bag all vacation?

01:29.362 --> 01:31.363
You show some respect for your elders.

01:31.398 --> 01:32.998
I lived through the
Depression and four seasons

01:33.033 --> 01:35.134
of <i>Caroline in the City!</i>

01:35.168 --> 01:36.302
(cell phone ringing)

01:36.336 --> 01:38.304
Deputy Director Bullock.

01:38.338 --> 01:40.005
Oh, sir, I'm afraid I can't help.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.674
I'm going out of town...

01:41.708 --> 01:43.242
Yeah, I guess I could access

01:43.276 --> 01:44.643
the surveillance cameras
with my phone.

01:44.678 --> 01:46.178
Stan?

01:46.213 --> 01:48.214
You promised, no work on vacation!

01:48.248 --> 01:50.583
Oh, I promise stuff
all the time; it means nothing.

01:50.617 --> 01:51.984
So help me,

01:52.018 --> 01:54.653
if you work through another
vacation, when we get back,

01:54.688 --> 01:57.123
I swear to God we're going to that

01:57.157 --> 01:59.191
marriage seminar we saw on TV.

01:59.226 --> 02:02.077
No! Not "Oh No He Didn't,
Oh Yes He Did!"

02:02.112 --> 02:04.613
He promised me he'd help me
flip the mattress.

02:04.648 --> 02:05.915
And then what happened?

02:05.949 --> 02:07.783
He went to the ball game instead.

02:07.818 --> 02:08.783
Oh, no, he didn't.

02:08.818 --> 02:11.220
WOMEN:
Oh, yes, he did!

02:14.057 --> 02:16.992
She's so angry
and flat-chested.

02:17.027 --> 02:19.094
Sorry, sir, I'm on vacation.

02:25.168 --> 02:26.702
(sighs):
Ah, see?

02:26.736 --> 02:28.938
Isn't this nice and relaxing?

02:28.972 --> 02:30.239
You know, it really is.

02:30.273 --> 02:31.874
I don't miss the office at all.

02:31.908 --> 02:34.210
In fact, I'm going to
e-mail the guys at the CIA

02:34.244 --> 02:35.911
a photo of us, and under the subject,

02:35.946 --> 02:37.513
I'm writing "Suck it!"

02:37.547 --> 02:39.982
'Cause they're there and I'm
here, and they can suck it.

02:40.016 --> 02:42.234
Pardon, would you mind
taking our picture?

02:42.269 --> 02:44.053
I'd be happy to.

02:44.087 --> 02:46.338
It's a phone, but it also
has a camera on it.

02:46.373 --> 02:47.790
I know. I have
the same one.

02:47.824 --> 02:50.259
No, that's the 5GS.
Top of the line.

02:50.293 --> 02:52.127
Yes. The 5GS.

02:54.064 --> 02:55.898
You're a gardener.

02:55.932 --> 02:57.216
Smile!

02:57.250 --> 02:59.768
(camera clicks)

02:59.803 --> 03:03.355
Hi, hello. I'm Joe, the outdoor
activities director here.

03:03.390 --> 03:05.274
Just sign us up for everything!

03:05.308 --> 03:06.408
Ha, ha!

03:06.443 --> 03:08.077
Your enthusiasm is infectious.

03:08.111 --> 03:10.112
It has inspired me to do this!

03:11.982 --> 03:13.499
Oh, my God, I did it!

03:13.533 --> 03:15.000
I've never done that before!

03:15.035 --> 03:16.919
My confidence is soaring!

03:16.953 --> 03:18.187
I'm gonna try singing.

03:18.221 --> 03:20.289
(horrible grumbling noise)

03:20.323 --> 03:22.274
(screeching)

03:22.309 --> 03:23.776
(roaring)

03:23.810 --> 03:25.945
(cell phone ringing)

03:25.979 --> 03:27.012
It's my boss.

03:27.047 --> 03:28.314
Stan...

03:28.348 --> 03:30.416
No work on vacation.
That's my motto.

03:30.450 --> 03:33.419
My motto is, "Don't cry
because it is over,

03:33.453 --> 03:35.554
smile because
it happened."

03:35.589 --> 03:37.523
Why is this guy
one-upping me?

03:37.557 --> 03:40.025
Why am I in competition
with a gardener?

03:42.629 --> 03:45.798
(kids laughing)

03:50.070 --> 03:53.772
Excuse me, where's
the hotel camp for older kids?

03:53.807 --> 03:55.474
This is the only camp.

03:55.508 --> 03:56.275
What?!

03:56.309 --> 03:58.077
Ginger snap?

03:58.111 --> 04:00.262
Ginger slap!

04:03.400 --> 04:05.968
Dude, run. This
place is the worst.

04:06.002 --> 04:08.404
(British accent):
Oh, I'm well aware.

04:08.438 --> 04:11.540
I have heard it rumored that
on the other side of this isle

04:11.575 --> 04:14.743
lies a beach whose patrons
are au natural.

04:14.778 --> 04:17.079
(New York accent): Yo-yo-yo,
we talkin' full vee?

04:17.113 --> 04:19.949
We would have to cross
the island by foot.

04:19.983 --> 04:22.935
A journey of several days
through treacherous jungle.

04:22.969 --> 04:26.305
(normal voice): Well, usually I hide
from danger like a big scaredy-puss.

04:26.339 --> 04:29.041
But there's something
about your accent.

04:29.075 --> 04:32.311
You know what, sure, let's do it!

04:34.064 --> 04:37.266
(New York accent): Hey, hey! What
are you gonna do with that, huh?!

04:37.300 --> 04:38.284
Nothin'!

04:38.318 --> 04:41.120
Get outta here!

04:43.123 --> 04:45.724
You're a lovely couple.

04:45.759 --> 04:48.360
So, which one of you is the man?

04:48.395 --> 04:49.828
(sighs)

04:49.863 --> 04:53.065
Oh, Omar, you were always the
one who was good at small talk.

04:53.099 --> 04:54.984
What am I going to do without you?

04:55.018 --> 04:58.087
Who's gonna set the recorder
so I don't miss <i>NCIS?</i>

04:58.121 --> 05:00.122
I love that show!

05:00.156 --> 05:02.091
I haven't missed an episode!

05:02.125 --> 05:04.259
But if I did, it wouldn't matter.

05:04.294 --> 05:05.661
BOTH: 'Cause they're
all the same!

05:05.695 --> 05:08.714
(both laugh)

05:08.748 --> 05:09.815
I'm Larry.

05:09.849 --> 05:12.151
Abigail.
Abigail Lemonparty.

05:12.185 --> 05:16.055
This is my first vacation by
myself since my wife departed.

05:16.089 --> 05:17.823
This is my first without Omar.

05:17.857 --> 05:19.925
Would you care for a Necco wafer?

05:19.960 --> 05:22.127
Oh.

05:22.162 --> 05:23.595
Mmm.

05:23.630 --> 05:25.864
Those people at Necco really know how

05:25.899 --> 05:28.300
to make a disgusting candy.

05:33.640 --> 05:35.641
So that was hotel sex.

05:35.675 --> 05:37.109
Still terrible.

05:37.143 --> 05:38.344
Tell me about it.

05:38.378 --> 05:40.312
I wanted it to be over so bad

05:40.347 --> 05:42.881
I just dumped some
room service mayo on your back.

05:42.916 --> 05:44.817
Well, I guess that's it.

05:44.851 --> 05:48.754
We've been married two years
and now our sex life is over.

05:55.061 --> 05:56.795
Francine, if you want to get to ten,

05:56.830 --> 05:58.497
you need to put the ball right here.

05:58.531 --> 05:59.832
You see where my swing is?

05:59.866 --> 06:01.550
Right there, right there.
You're jamming me up.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.686
It's not about getting to ten.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.988
It's about enjoying each other.

06:06.022 --> 06:08.290
Oh, no, you're right,
it's fun getting to eight.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.626
Then once to nine, but never ten.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.928
(cell phone ringing)

06:12.962 --> 06:15.097
Come on, no phone calls.
Serve it!

06:18.868 --> 06:20.235
I got it!

06:20.270 --> 06:21.403
Deputy Director Bullock.

06:21.438 --> 06:23.121
BULLOCK:
Smith, I happened to find

06:23.139 --> 06:24.857
something interesting when I zoomed in

06:24.891 --> 06:26.625
on the "suck it" photo you sent us.

06:26.659 --> 06:27.893
Why would you zoom in?

06:27.927 --> 06:29.528
Oh, no reason.

06:29.562 --> 06:32.064
(mouse clicks)

06:32.098 --> 06:34.867
The man in the background
of this photo

06:34.901 --> 06:36.935
is Goran the Mutilator--

06:36.970 --> 06:39.538
a war criminal who's been
in hiding for years.

06:39.572 --> 06:41.707
But he's the outdoor
activities director.

06:41.741 --> 06:43.442
He's a bloody monster.

06:43.476 --> 06:45.477
(mouse clicking)

06:48.181 --> 06:50.149
(computer beeps)

06:50.183 --> 06:51.617
I need you to kill him.

06:51.651 --> 06:52.851
Sir, I'm on vacation.

06:52.886 --> 06:54.720
And I promised my wife
I wouldn't work.

06:59.359 --> 07:01.060
Smith, are you crazy?

07:01.094 --> 07:04.630
I'm giving you the opportunity
to bring down a war criminal.

07:04.664 --> 07:07.733
Plus, you get 400 CIA bucks.

07:07.767 --> 07:09.301
Four-hundred?!

07:14.607 --> 07:15.674
Well?

07:15.708 --> 07:17.176
You can count on me.

07:17.210 --> 07:19.578
(panting)

07:19.612 --> 07:22.247
Okay, let's do this.

07:22.282 --> 07:23.715
98...

07:23.750 --> 07:25.717
99... 100!

07:25.752 --> 07:27.986
Yay! Woo-hoo! All right!
Yeah! We did it!

07:28.021 --> 07:29.521
That guy.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.684
Today, we're going to
learn the ancient art

07:36.719 --> 07:38.686
of making hip-hop necklaces.

07:38.721 --> 07:40.361
Look how great this is.

07:40.481 --> 07:42.189
No kids, no work.

07:42.425 --> 07:44.859
Just you and me.

07:48.631 --> 07:50.624
Uh, I'm gonna go make
sure the people who live

07:50.744 --> 07:53.081
just outside the
resort are super poor.

07:54.403 --> 07:56.462
Now, a lot of brothers
like to represent

07:56.580 --> 07:58.881
the area code from whence they hail.

07:58.915 --> 08:02.218
Atlanta's 404 is quite popular.

08:02.252 --> 08:04.720
(panting)

08:09.926 --> 08:12.394
It's too far;
I'll never make it.

08:12.429 --> 08:13.863
I have a plan.

08:13.897 --> 08:16.232
We mount a wild steed of our choosing

08:16.266 --> 08:18.467
and it shall whisk us
away across this valley.

08:18.502 --> 08:21.804
Okay, sounds like a really
bad idea, but that accent.

08:21.838 --> 08:24.240
(grunts) Yeah, let's do it!

08:27.110 --> 08:28.577
(neighing)

08:28.612 --> 08:30.079
It's working!

08:33.116 --> 08:35.116
(screaming)

08:37.153 --> 08:39.221
Off we go!

08:39.256 --> 08:41.590
My bones!

08:44.126 --> 08:46.095
(dolphins clicking)

08:47.797 --> 08:53.102
Stay away from that bad, bad
man, you sweet, sweet dolphins.

08:54.137 --> 08:55.037
(silenced gunshot)

08:55.772 --> 08:57.840
Oh, my.

08:57.874 --> 09:00.075
(silenced gunshots)

09:00.110 --> 09:01.677
Oh, no.

09:01.711 --> 09:03.546
(silenced gunshot)

09:03.580 --> 09:04.580
Oh, the baby.

09:04.614 --> 09:06.181
Stan?

09:06.216 --> 09:07.349
(gasps)

09:07.384 --> 09:10.653
While you were out
looking for poor people,

09:10.687 --> 09:12.588
you missed the entire class!

09:12.622 --> 09:15.157
Well, since we're here, let's
just do the dolphin experience.

09:15.191 --> 09:17.192
Sorry, it's closed.

09:24.768 --> 09:26.902
Here's to a sexless marriage.

09:26.937 --> 09:28.704
I guess I'll stop shaving.

09:28.738 --> 09:31.774
Let the forest reclaim the land.

09:31.808 --> 09:33.609
I'm sorry, we didn't mean to overhear,

09:33.643 --> 09:35.244
but we used to be like you.

09:35.278 --> 09:36.812
But then we turned it around.

09:36.846 --> 09:37.947
How?

09:37.981 --> 09:39.415
We swap.

09:39.449 --> 09:40.416
Here's our number.

09:40.450 --> 09:41.584
Think about it.

09:41.618 --> 09:43.452
(chuckles):
Oh, definitely, we will.

09:45.288 --> 09:46.555
Sounds good, right, babe?

09:46.590 --> 09:47.890
What a bunch of freaks!

09:47.924 --> 09:49.058
Freaks!

09:49.092 --> 09:51.260
We don't have to have sex
with other people.

09:51.294 --> 09:53.195
We just have to get more creative.

09:53.229 --> 09:55.631
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

09:55.665 --> 09:56.899
Choking!
Role playing!

09:56.933 --> 09:58.934
Role playing!

09:58.969 --> 10:02.137
Babe, that was...
terrible.

10:02.172 --> 10:04.840
(sighs) Yeah, it was.

10:04.874 --> 10:07.810
I guess now I'll just
use it for peeing.

10:10.113 --> 10:13.549
My eyesight has started failing
me as I'm getting up there.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.417
I need large print books.

10:15.452 --> 10:19.321
Come on, you could easily pass
for a woman in her early 70s.

10:19.356 --> 10:21.123
You, Larry Herman,

10:21.157 --> 10:23.792
are what my grandmother would
call a... (speaks gibberish)

10:23.827 --> 10:25.694
She was from the old country.

10:25.729 --> 10:26.829
Don't miss her.

10:26.863 --> 10:28.864
Do you have any sunblock
in your fanny pack?

10:28.898 --> 10:31.000
It's a colostomy bag.

10:31.034 --> 10:32.501
Hey, chin up.

10:32.535 --> 10:35.437
You're alive; it doesn't matter
where your poop goes.

10:35.472 --> 10:38.374
Getting mine to go anywhere
at all is a big to-do.

10:38.408 --> 10:40.175
Bit of a home body, my poop.

10:40.210 --> 10:43.112
Likes to stay put.

10:45.148 --> 10:48.884
Abigail Lemonparty, would
you like to go with me

10:48.918 --> 10:50.686
to the luau tonight?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.221
Oh, Larry.

10:52.255 --> 10:54.657
As my grandmother would say,

10:54.691 --> 10:57.226
as long as you're not a Puerto Rican.

10:58.762 --> 11:00.062
(sighs)

11:00.096 --> 11:01.397
This is nice.

11:01.431 --> 11:03.766
Just you and me, together.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.502
(cell phone vibrates)

11:09.039 --> 11:11.306
Francine, can I go get you a drink?

11:11.341 --> 11:12.341
I'm good.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.009
I'll run and get you some sunblock.

11:14.044 --> 11:15.611
I'm fine, Stan.

11:15.645 --> 11:19.381
All I want to do is lay here with you.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.717
I promised my buddy
Chuck I'd help him move.

11:21.751 --> 11:25.554
Hate to leave you, but I'm
the one with the pickup truck.

11:25.588 --> 11:28.590
(cell phone vibrates)

11:30.927 --> 11:33.295
That son of a bitch is working.

11:33.329 --> 11:34.663
(cell phone vibrates)

11:37.734 --> 11:38.867
Come along.

11:38.902 --> 11:40.736
Doing the best I can, Liam.

11:40.770 --> 11:43.372
That horse really did
a number on my hot dog.

11:45.241 --> 11:47.409
Oh, man, we have to turn back.

11:47.444 --> 11:48.944
Hogwash.

11:48.978 --> 11:51.880
What we must do is bind
banana leaves to our arms

11:51.915 --> 11:56.552
and it will give us the
additional lift that we need.

11:56.586 --> 11:58.220
And your last one was terrible.

11:58.254 --> 12:00.823
But your accent, it's so convincing.

12:00.857 --> 12:02.391
You know what, let's do it!

12:06.296 --> 12:08.063
(grunts)

12:08.098 --> 12:09.565
(sighs):
Oh.

12:09.599 --> 12:12.067
Tough day to be my hot dog.

12:15.672 --> 12:19.641
Mario, I met a very nice man today.

12:19.676 --> 12:22.010
He said he could never
get tired of my laugh.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.279
(laughs)

12:29.686 --> 12:30.586
Oh.

12:30.620 --> 12:33.422
Looks like he met someone.

12:33.456 --> 12:34.656
Someone much younger.

12:34.691 --> 12:35.991
(farts)

12:36.025 --> 12:37.926
Excuse me, Mario, won't you?

12:37.961 --> 12:40.863
What happened to our plans, Larry?!

12:40.897 --> 12:43.132
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

12:43.166 --> 12:44.199
Poor woman.

12:44.234 --> 12:47.636
Dementia's a terrible thing.

12:47.670 --> 12:49.338
(quietly):
Beat it, you old bag.

12:49.372 --> 12:51.874
You're a bad man, Larry!

12:51.908 --> 12:53.575
Go sit on a ham sandwich!

12:53.610 --> 12:54.610
With mustard!

12:54.644 --> 12:56.779
(sobbing)

12:56.813 --> 12:57.980
(people whispering)

12:58.014 --> 12:59.414
Mustard.
Mustard. Mustard.

12:59.449 --> 13:01.450
(whispering continues)

13:08.191 --> 13:09.858
You!
Ooh!

13:09.893 --> 13:12.227
You're trying to kill
someone on our vacation!

13:12.262 --> 13:13.595
What-what, this?

13:13.630 --> 13:16.498
No, no, I signed us up for
the couples' Magnum P.I. class.

13:16.533 --> 13:17.499
You're Higgins.

13:17.534 --> 13:20.002
I saw Bullock's text!

13:20.036 --> 13:23.071
Francine, look, the guy
I'm after is a monster.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.140
He's exterminated entire villages.

13:25.175 --> 13:27.309
Well...
(sighs)

13:27.343 --> 13:29.678
then I guess he deserves
what we're gonna give him.

13:29.712 --> 13:31.079
Wait, "we"?

13:31.114 --> 13:34.416
Stan, we went on this vacation
to spend time together,

13:34.450 --> 13:36.852
and that starts now.

13:36.886 --> 13:39.254
So, who do we have to kill?

13:39.289 --> 13:41.190
Joe, the activities director.

13:41.224 --> 13:44.827
Aw, but he's got such a sweet smile.

13:44.861 --> 13:47.729
I'm gonna shoot him in his face.

13:50.429 --> 13:51.866
Francine, are you sure about this?

13:51.986 --> 13:53.720
Look, the sooner we kill this guy,

13:53.754 --> 13:55.989
the sooner we can start
enjoying ourselves.

13:56.023 --> 13:59.158
Oh, I signed us up for hot
air ballooning at sunset.

13:59.427 --> 14:00.914
Think we'll nail this guy by then?

14:01.034 --> 14:02.662
I-I'm not, I'm not sure.

14:02.697 --> 14:04.998
Come on, what's so hard about it?

14:05.032 --> 14:06.566
Bam! Bam! Bam!

14:06.601 --> 14:09.669
I just killed that waiter, a
baby and a fat guy on a Rascal.

14:09.704 --> 14:12.172
But, honey, Joe is the
outdoor activities director.

14:12.206 --> 14:13.673
He's always surrounded by people.

14:13.708 --> 14:14.875
So kill 'em all.

14:14.909 --> 14:16.643
I think it's hot
when you talk like that,

14:16.677 --> 14:18.545
but that's not how we do things
at the CIA.

14:18.579 --> 14:21.615
Look, I just need you to get him
alone, then I can shoot him.

14:21.649 --> 14:26.553
Okay, well, you figure it out
while I take out these two.

14:26.587 --> 14:28.788
Bam! Bam!

14:28.823 --> 14:31.458
Should have done that a long time ago.

14:36.097 --> 14:39.599
Think you can prey upon the
emotions of a fake elderly widow

14:39.634 --> 14:41.535
who had the courage to open her heart?

14:41.569 --> 14:43.236
Well, guess again!

14:49.010 --> 14:50.477
Hello there.

14:50.511 --> 14:52.712
I'm George Hamilton, 20 years ago.

14:52.747 --> 14:54.414
Oh, my God, I loved you!

14:54.448 --> 14:56.383
Would you like to play
a set of tennis?

14:56.417 --> 14:58.118
Actually, she's with me.

14:58.152 --> 14:59.619
Oh, I see.

14:59.654 --> 15:03.156
Hey, how about we play a new
game: what's in our fanny packs?

15:03.191 --> 15:05.959
I have a scorecard
from my last round of golf--

15:05.993 --> 15:08.995
I shot a 206-- and a half-full
Subway sandwich card.

15:09.030 --> 15:10.063
What's in yours?

15:10.097 --> 15:11.631
I don't think that's any of your...

15:11.666 --> 15:12.682
Zip!

15:13.985 --> 15:16.253
That's a strange thing
to carry around.

15:16.287 --> 15:18.288
I like to leave mine in the toilet.

15:19.824 --> 15:21.825
Shall we?

15:27.098 --> 15:30.333
Hi. So we've decided to take
you up on your proposition.

15:30.368 --> 15:31.902
Fantastic!

15:31.936 --> 15:34.971
You're doing the right thing for
your marriage and your sex life.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.074

15:44.549 --> 15:46.550
Oh.
Oh.

15:46.584 --> 15:49.319
(both grunting)

15:49.353 --> 15:51.988
Thanks for the private lesson, Joe.

15:52.023 --> 15:54.157
Happy to do it.

15:54.191 --> 15:55.058
STAN (over earpiece):
Francine.

15:55.092 --> 15:56.159
Yeah?

15:56.193 --> 15:58.311
Will you please just
keep him in one place?

15:58.346 --> 15:59.946
But I can beat this guy, Stan.

15:59.981 --> 16:01.181
We're trying to kill him!

16:01.215 --> 16:02.649
Right.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.168
(chirps)

16:07.204 --> 16:09.439
Hey, little guy, gonna
get yourself hurt there.

16:09.473 --> 16:10.590
(chittering)

16:10.625 --> 16:12.125
Aw, are you nursing?

16:12.159 --> 16:13.577
Did you lose your mommy?

16:13.611 --> 16:16.296
Go find your mommy.

16:16.330 --> 16:17.647
(makes gunshot noise)

16:17.682 --> 16:19.332
Oh. Oh, no-no-no.

16:19.367 --> 16:20.767
I'm not gonna kill you.

16:20.801 --> 16:22.402
I've killed enough animals today.

16:22.453 --> 16:23.837
(both grunting)

16:23.871 --> 16:25.205
Stan, what the hell?

16:25.239 --> 16:26.573
Why didn't you shoot him?

16:26.607 --> 16:28.475
A suicidal lemur's got my gun!

16:28.509 --> 16:29.476
(sighs)

16:29.510 --> 16:30.810
Oh, the hell with it.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.480
Ah! Francine! Ow!

16:33.514 --> 16:34.781
What are you doing?!

16:34.815 --> 16:36.750
You're Goran the Mutilator!

16:36.784 --> 16:39.552
You've killed thousands
of innocent people

16:39.587 --> 16:42.856
and you're screwing up my vacation!

16:42.890 --> 16:43.990
Now die!

16:47.428 --> 16:50.063
You think you two can kill me?

16:50.097 --> 16:53.166
Stan, you're in the
CIA; what do we do?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.334
Stan?

16:54.368 --> 16:55.168
Run!

16:56.904 --> 16:59.906
(slow-motion groaning)

17:02.910 --> 17:05.779
(silenced gunshots)

17:25.650 --> 17:27.817
(both panting)

17:27.852 --> 17:28.802
We lost him.

17:28.836 --> 17:29.936
(loud pop, both scream)

17:29.970 --> 17:31.971
(both sigh)

17:34.008 --> 17:36.559
(man and woman scream)

17:37.595 --> 17:39.462
(both scream)

17:40.414 --> 17:41.464
(grunts)

17:42.466 --> 17:44.167
Francine!

17:47.288 --> 17:49.789
(grunting)

17:49.824 --> 17:52.459
Oh, my leg!

17:52.493 --> 17:55.061
My, my, we can't let
that get infected.

17:55.096 --> 17:56.963
We'll have to pack it with bees.

17:56.997 --> 17:58.465
(buzzing)

17:58.499 --> 17:59.566
Bees?!

17:59.600 --> 18:01.668
You want to put bees
on my open wound?!

18:01.702 --> 18:04.637
They will clean it,
like in the days of old.

18:04.672 --> 18:07.107
No, they used maggots to clean wounds.

18:07.141 --> 18:10.427
And what are maggots
if not wingless bees?

18:10.461 --> 18:13.063
I don't know
what it is about that accent.

18:13.097 --> 18:14.330
Okay, go ahead!

18:18.703 --> 18:20.603
Oh, it tickles.

18:20.638 --> 18:21.738
It must be working...

18:21.772 --> 18:22.739
(screams)

18:22.773 --> 18:23.840
Th-They're stinging me!

18:23.874 --> 18:24.941
Ow!

18:24.975 --> 18:27.077
Now th-they've crawled
inside my body!

18:27.111 --> 18:29.596
Th-They're stinging me
from the inside!

18:29.630 --> 18:32.599
You sound smart,
like Hugh Grant the movie star,

18:32.633 --> 18:36.102
but you're stupid,
like Hugh Grant the person!

18:36.137 --> 18:37.837
(both straining)

18:41.225 --> 18:42.842
You killed my wife!

18:43.878 --> 18:45.378
(screams)

18:52.553 --> 18:54.521
Francine? How...

18:57.508 --> 18:59.959
Thank you once again, hip-hop.

18:59.994 --> 19:04.497
Goran, I'm going to take
great pleasure in killing you.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.034
What the...?

19:08.068 --> 19:09.869
You're welcome!

19:11.889 --> 19:14.190
That guy.

19:19.046 --> 19:22.031
When someone shoots your
wife square in the chest,

19:22.066 --> 19:23.967
it really gets a man thinking.

19:24.001 --> 19:26.336
From now on, work comes second.

19:26.370 --> 19:29.672
Oh, Stan, that's all I want.

19:29.707 --> 19:32.509
Ugh, there's blood
all over our clothes.

19:32.543 --> 19:34.344
And we don't have
anything to change into.

19:34.378 --> 19:36.246
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.154
We made it!

19:44.188 --> 19:45.622
After all I've been through,

19:45.656 --> 19:47.724
the promised land!

19:52.696 --> 19:54.781
Oh, God, that's my mom!

19:54.832 --> 19:56.866
Oh, God, that's my dad!

19:56.901 --> 19:59.552
I didn't almost die to see them naked!

19:59.587 --> 20:01.538
(shuddering)

20:01.572 --> 20:04.607
Well, how about that one over there?

20:07.344 --> 20:09.145
Ah, that's my sister!

20:09.180 --> 20:10.380
Give us a look.

20:10.414 --> 20:15.418
Just let me make...
triple sure... that it's her.

20:15.452 --> 20:18.121
(both moaning)

20:18.155 --> 20:21.291
Oh, my God, the spark is back, babe!

20:21.325 --> 20:22.892
We just needed the jolt of

20:22.927 --> 20:25.562
<i>almost</i> doing something
completely crazy.

20:25.596 --> 20:27.897
And to think we nearly did it.

20:27.932 --> 20:29.632
Right, right.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.302
We didn't go through with it at all.

20:32.336 --> 20:35.288
Jeff, you have mayo on your back.

20:37.324 --> 20:39.626
Thank you, Omar!

20:39.660 --> 20:42.695
Thank you for showing me
I can go on without you!

20:51.005 --> 20:53.556
I know what you did
to our kids, you monster!

20:53.591 --> 20:54.707
(laughs)

20:54.742 --> 20:58.399
Why-why can't I
leave things nice?
