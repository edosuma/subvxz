WEBVTT

00:01.781 --> 00:03.392
Bizarre...

00:03.481 --> 00:06.719
They have these
very strange, circular eyes.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.272
Mysterious...

00:08.361 --> 00:10.659
This pyramid almost looks
like a large

00:10.814 --> 00:12.659
launch ramp
on top of a platform.

00:12.814 --> 00:14.659
Gigantic...

00:14.661 --> 00:16.572
Look at
the size of these blocks.

00:16.574 --> 00:18.759
I mean, that one right there
is a minimum of one ton.

00:18.914 --> 00:21.519
But are they extraterrestrial?

00:21.541 --> 00:24.532
There was something very unusual

00:24.641 --> 00:27.592
happening on this island.

00:27.747 --> 00:29.465
Oak Island
treasure hunter Marty Lagina...

00:29.621 --> 00:31.599
The effort to create this
is extraordinary.

00:31.754 --> 00:34.579
...joins
ancient astronaut theorist

00:34.601 --> 00:36.205
Giorgio Tsoukalos...

00:36.261 --> 00:37.599
What do you think
that represents?

00:37.754 --> 00:40.812
It could be
some type of a flying craft.

00:40.967 --> 00:43.759
...for a sky high exploration

00:43.781 --> 00:47.259
of one of the most
unusual places on Earth.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.145
It's possible
that Sardinia was the epicenter

00:49.201 --> 00:52.919
for giants in the ancient world.

00:52.961 --> 00:56.539
Will Marty help Giorgio solve

00:56.694 --> 00:58.739
a centuries-old mystery?

00:58.914 --> 01:01.479
Look at this.
It's a perfect circle.

01:01.501 --> 01:02.852
This is spectacular.

01:03.007 --> 01:05.272
And will Marty return home

01:05.274 --> 01:09.239
convinced that aliens
really do exist?

01:09.394 --> 01:11.005
I am literally wowed by this.

01:11.007 --> 01:15.365
Someone or some ones had
extraordinary knowledge.

01:46.887 --> 01:49.805
Sardinia, Italy.

01:49.961 --> 01:52.685
Today, this Mediterranean island

01:52.687 --> 01:55.399
off the west coast
of the Italian mainland

01:55.574 --> 01:59.165
is well known as the playground
of the rich and famous.

01:59.221 --> 02:03.399
But 2,000 years ago,
Sardinia was home to one

02:03.554 --> 02:08.339
of the most mysterious cultures
in all of the ancient world.

02:08.494 --> 02:10.745
There's actually
tens of thousands of sites

02:10.747 --> 02:13.779
on that particular island,
and even a pyramid.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.052
This is quite rare in Europe.

02:16.054 --> 02:19.012
And so, it's got
a vast megalithic culture

02:19.167 --> 02:21.192
going back
several thousand years.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.119
And it really
is an overlooked place

02:23.294 --> 02:24.919
when it comes to archaeology.

02:26.907 --> 02:28.672
Sardinia was once home

02:28.847 --> 02:31.939
to a very mysterious
and arcane culture

02:32.094 --> 02:35.192
called
"the Nuragic civilization."

02:35.194 --> 02:39.639
The island is replete
with the residue

02:39.641 --> 02:42.085
of megalithic constructions.

02:42.241 --> 02:45.305
All over the island, you find
these megalithic stone towers

02:45.461 --> 02:47.472
called "nuraghe,"

02:47.474 --> 02:51.419
which were constructed
sometime in the distant past.

02:51.441 --> 02:56.119
You also have the megalithic
tombs of the giants.

02:59.154 --> 03:00.839
Giants?

03:00.881 --> 03:04.399
Is it possible that Sardinia
was once the home

03:04.421 --> 03:08.339
of an ancient race strangely
different from our own?

03:08.494 --> 03:12.172
But if so,
where did they come from?

03:12.261 --> 03:17.365
And, perhaps more importantly,
where did they go?

03:17.541 --> 03:21.899
It was to find answers
to these intriguing questions

03:22.054 --> 03:25.285
that ancient astronaut theorist
and publisher Giorgio Tsoukalos

03:25.361 --> 03:28.092
traveled to Sardinia
in May of 2018.

03:28.267 --> 03:31.012
Giorgio.

03:31.014 --> 03:33.252
- Hey.
- How crazy is this place?

03:33.254 --> 03:34.450
- Isn't this something?
- So great to meet you

03:34.474 --> 03:36.272
- here in Sardinia.
- Great to meet you.

03:36.274 --> 03:37.794
He had also
taken advantage of the trip

03:37.927 --> 03:41.885
to meet up with Oak Island
treasure hunter Marty Lagina,

03:42.061 --> 03:45.499
who, over the years, has been
a frequent visitor to the island

03:45.501 --> 03:49.152
and shares Giorgio's
fascination with it.

03:49.154 --> 03:51.792
You know, I've been here; the
last time, about 35 years ago

03:51.947 --> 03:53.339
- with my parents...
- Really?

03:53.341 --> 03:55.285
- ...on summer vacation.
- No kidding.

03:55.441 --> 03:57.972
I am, uh, of Italian ancestry,

03:57.981 --> 04:00.999
and I came here,
I think it was four years ago,

04:01.001 --> 04:04.092
and I was here
on an Italian language course.

04:04.094 --> 04:06.352
So, in the process, I find out
about these nuraghes,

04:06.361 --> 04:08.345
and I find out
about these ancient things,

04:08.501 --> 04:11.379
and I find out that nobody seems
to know anything about them.

04:11.534 --> 04:12.779
And very seriously, I'd like

04:12.934 --> 04:14.732
your opinion
about all this stuff.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.832
- Right. -I don't know whether
this means anything,

04:16.834 --> 04:18.649
but when I was talking
to some of the locals, you know,

04:18.673 --> 04:20.714
they talk that there are
a lot of legends of giants,

04:20.834 --> 04:22.672
- you know, giants.
- Really?

04:22.827 --> 04:24.817
- Does that mean anything?
- Absolutely, because only

04:24.841 --> 04:27.492
a few years ago,
I was exploring on Malta,

04:27.581 --> 04:29.665
and there,
the entire civilization

04:29.821 --> 04:32.005
is based on the idea of giants.

04:32.007 --> 04:33.705
- Really?
- And some have suggested,

04:33.881 --> 04:36.019
according to the ancient
astronaut theory,

04:36.061 --> 04:37.805
that when the gods descended

04:37.807 --> 04:41.005
and mated with
the beautiful women of Earth,

04:41.161 --> 04:43.799
they produced giants.

04:43.801 --> 04:47.039
So every time there are stories
and legends of giants,

04:47.194 --> 04:49.145
I find that very interesting.

04:49.147 --> 04:50.839
Well, there's a lot
of material here,

04:51.014 --> 04:52.243
- so let's-let's have a look.
- All right,

04:52.267 --> 04:53.892
let's do it.

04:54.047 --> 04:56.005
To begin their investigation,

04:56.181 --> 04:57.912
Giorgio and Marty travel

04:57.914 --> 05:00.499
to the National Archaeological
Museum in Cagliari,

05:00.654 --> 05:04.645
where some of Sardinia's
oldest and strangest artifacts

05:04.801 --> 05:06.919
are on display.

05:11.827 --> 05:14.045
It's just all weird.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.312
And that this helmet on,
those weird eyes.

05:17.314 --> 05:19.199
Featured
in the museum's collection

05:19.201 --> 05:21.779
are a number
of enormous stone statues known

05:21.934 --> 05:24.812
as the Giants of Mont'e Prama.

05:24.814 --> 05:28.132
They were first discovered
in 1974,

05:28.287 --> 05:31.632
when a local farmer stumbled
upon a large carved stone

05:31.807 --> 05:33.739
protruding from the ground.

05:33.894 --> 05:37.265
Archaeologists quickly
took over the site,

05:37.321 --> 05:41.712
recovering more than
5,000 broken remnants.

05:41.714 --> 05:44.245
Mainstream historians suggest

05:44.247 --> 05:48.072
the statues were carved
by the Nuragic people,

05:48.161 --> 05:49.699
a civilization that is believed

05:49.874 --> 05:53.132
to have inhabited
the island for 2,000 years,

05:53.134 --> 05:55.892
emerging in 1800 BC

05:55.894 --> 06:00.519
and mysteriously disappearing
around 200 AD.

06:00.561 --> 06:04.372
But what also makes
the statues so mysterious

06:04.547 --> 06:07.559
is the strange way
in which the faces are carved...

06:07.714 --> 06:10.472
Not so much resembling humans,

06:10.627 --> 06:15.392
but what some
might describe as robots.

06:15.481 --> 06:19.019
The Giant
statues found at Mont'e Prama

06:19.194 --> 06:22.565
are approximately seven
and a half to eight feet tall.

06:22.567 --> 06:26.939
You have warriors
and boxers and archers.

06:26.941 --> 06:30.572
The statues themselves
are just noted for their size.

06:30.727 --> 06:33.672
And it's thought that they
represent the Nuragic people,

06:33.674 --> 06:38.339
that this is actually what we
might have that looks like them.

06:40.654 --> 06:41.825
If he's a model of that,

06:41.981 --> 06:44.312
why doesn't he have disc eyes?

06:44.314 --> 06:48.092
'Cause he doesn't have disc eyes
and he certainly could.

06:48.181 --> 06:50.899
What I find intriguing is that
the giants of Mont'e Prama...

06:50.941 --> 06:53.825
Although they were discovered
in the 1970s...

06:53.827 --> 06:58.439
Were not put on display until
sometime near the year 2000.

06:58.594 --> 07:02.545
And I believe that these statues
simply do not conform

07:02.621 --> 07:04.945
to the conventional
archaeological narrative

07:05.101 --> 07:07.119
on the island, and instead,

07:07.274 --> 07:10.539
point to the reality that there
was something very unusual

07:10.541 --> 07:12.532
happening on this island.

07:12.687 --> 07:16.859
This is very human,
except it has weird eyes.

07:16.881 --> 07:19.572
- And disproportionate.
- And disproportions.

07:19.747 --> 07:21.865
When you look
at these stone figurines,

07:21.867 --> 07:24.559
they are extremely peculiar,
and they give the impression

07:24.714 --> 07:26.872
of actually being giants.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.505
The strangest things
about the statues

07:30.681 --> 07:35.185
is that they have
these very strange circular eyes

07:35.341 --> 07:38.925
that almost give them
an otherworldly feel.

07:39.081 --> 07:42.425
After their visit to the museum,

07:42.481 --> 07:45.139
Giorgio and Marty meet
at a nearby restaurant

07:45.161 --> 07:48.752
with archaeological tour guide
Maria Paola Loi,

07:48.754 --> 07:50.372
Paola? - ...Who has offered
to share with them

07:50.374 --> 07:51.592
some of Sardinia's
local legends.

07:51.594 --> 07:54.492
Ciao, I'm Paola,
how are you? Ciao.

07:54.647 --> 07:56.277
- Pleased to meet you, welcome to Sardinia.
- Appreciate it.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.979
- Grazie.
- Fantastic.

07:58.001 --> 07:59.419
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:59.574 --> 08:01.999
- Did you go to the museum? Oh.
- We did.

08:02.001 --> 08:06.085
Tell me what you think about the
finds that are displayed there.

08:06.087 --> 08:09.812
I mean, up until about
six months ago, I had no idea...

08:09.814 --> 08:12.112
- about these statues here.
- No idea.

08:12.267 --> 08:14.799
So now when I saw

08:14.801 --> 08:17.279
these statues of the Giganti
for the first time,

08:17.321 --> 08:22.245
not only did the eyes remind me
of, uh, C-3PO from Star Wars...

08:22.247 --> 08:23.939
- It's a dead ringer.
- ...but also,

08:24.094 --> 08:29.039
there are these giant-eyed
statues in Tell Asmar,

08:29.081 --> 08:33.385
from the ancient Sumerian
and Babylonian times.

08:33.561 --> 08:38.125
Originally, the archeologists
and also scholars

08:38.280 --> 08:40.198
who mentioned
the Nuragic civilization

08:40.201 --> 08:44.599
said that these people probably
arrived from Mesopotamia.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.999
- So the Anunnakis?
- Right.

08:47.174 --> 08:49.399
The Anunnaki?

08:49.421 --> 08:51.905
The race of winged giants
as described

08:51.981 --> 08:55.359
in ancient Sumerian texts,
and frequently depicted

08:55.534 --> 08:58.145
on the temples and icons
of ancient Babylon?

08:58.301 --> 09:00.559
There are a lot of connections

09:00.714 --> 09:02.852
between the Sardinian language

09:03.007 --> 09:07.425
and the different languages
of Mesopotamia,

09:07.481 --> 09:12.352
suggesting that Sumerians did
actually come to Sardinia.

09:12.527 --> 09:14.572
They would've brought with them
the traditions to do

09:14.661 --> 09:18.332
with the Anunnaki,
the gods of heaven and Earth,

09:18.487 --> 09:23.452
which many people believe
were celestial beings.

09:23.454 --> 09:25.212
What's interesting about
the Anunnaki is that there's

09:25.221 --> 09:27.672
all types of wall reliefs

09:27.847 --> 09:30.079
which depict
the Anunnaki standing amongst

09:30.081 --> 09:32.479
the other Sumerian human beings.

09:32.654 --> 09:36.619
They're always depicted as
larger beings of great stature.

09:36.774 --> 09:39.992
Even in Sardinia,
these various statues of giants

09:40.147 --> 09:42.639
could be actually
depicting the Anunnaki.

09:42.814 --> 09:44.972
- I'm getting goose bumps.
- Yeah, I know.

09:44.974 --> 09:47.259
- I know. This leads me
to the next question.

09:47.281 --> 09:50.685
Are you aware
of any ancient legends

09:50.841 --> 09:53.192
of giants here on Sardinia?

09:53.347 --> 09:54.699
Oh, yes.

10:01.621 --> 10:03.679
The name "giant" recalls

10:03.854 --> 10:06.352
in the name of the giant tombs,

10:06.354 --> 10:08.905
in the name
of the giant statues,

10:09.061 --> 10:12.059
and also, the type
of architecture: "cyclopean."

10:12.214 --> 10:15.265
So, to the observer, only a
Cyclops could've built this wall

10:15.267 --> 10:17.230
- and that's why they call it...
- That's the legend behind it.

10:17.254 --> 10:19.139
Yeah, okay.

10:19.141 --> 10:21.945
The Cyclops are, of course,
the mythological giants

10:21.947 --> 10:24.952
that are mentioned by Homer
in the Odyssey.

10:25.107 --> 10:27.205
- Yes.
- Yes.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.119
In the epic
Greek poem the Odyssey,

10:30.294 --> 10:32.852
written by Homer
in the eighth century B.C.,

10:33.007 --> 10:38.219
the hero, Odysseus, encounters
a Cyclops named Polyphemus,

10:38.241 --> 10:42.545
a one-eyed giant who lives on an
island with others of his kind.

10:42.701 --> 10:47.019
According to legend,
Polyphemus was also part divine,

10:47.174 --> 10:50.825
as he was the son of Poseidon,
the god of the sea.

10:50.981 --> 10:53.912
So, the Cyclops
are a legendary race.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.439
The most famous one, of course,

10:55.481 --> 10:58.125
is Odysseus fights one
in the Odyssey.

10:58.281 --> 11:01.045
They are extraordinarily
large creatures.

11:01.101 --> 11:06.565
They're humanoid, of course, and
famously with the single eye.

11:06.567 --> 11:10.665
A lot of the Greeks
believed that towers

11:10.667 --> 11:13.079
were invented by them, actually.

11:13.234 --> 11:15.705
There are
some fascinating structures

11:15.861 --> 11:18.419
in parts of Greece
that are massive.

11:18.574 --> 11:21.632
Now the Cyclops were
one-eyed giants.

11:21.634 --> 11:24.159
And it was thought that
they were the only ones

11:24.314 --> 11:26.759
strong enough
to lift these massive boulders

11:26.914 --> 11:29.505
and put them into place,
no mortar.

11:29.507 --> 11:33.299
I'm always curious,
what was the true origin,

11:33.454 --> 11:35.965
what was the original spark
of inspiration?

11:36.121 --> 11:38.159
What happened?

11:38.314 --> 11:39.659
- That's what we seek, huh?
- Yes.

11:39.814 --> 11:41.519
Yeah, that-that's
the ultimate quest.

11:46.681 --> 11:49.385
The next day,
Giorgio and Marty

11:49.541 --> 11:51.425
travel to the remote town
of Siddi...

11:51.481 --> 11:53.385
This is neat.

11:53.541 --> 11:55.999
...to visit a place
known as Sa Domu e S'orcu:

11:56.174 --> 11:58.039
A Tomb of the Giants.

12:00.154 --> 12:03.459
It is one of more than
800 similar structures

12:03.614 --> 12:05.065
on the island.

12:05.121 --> 12:06.979
These stones
are getting close

12:07.134 --> 12:08.665
to the ones you were describing
from our sites.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.125
Yeah, 'cause
we're talking a minimum,

12:10.127 --> 12:13.019
I would say,
between four and six tons.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.839
Maybe four and 12?

12:14.841 --> 12:17.385
Joining them is
their archaeological guide,

12:17.387 --> 12:19.399
Ivana Malu.

12:19.554 --> 12:21.465
What I find interesting here

12:21.641 --> 12:24.825
is that the largest blocks
are situated on top.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.732
It would make more sense to have
the big blocks at the bottom

12:28.907 --> 12:30.792
and then the smaller blocks.

12:30.794 --> 12:34.845
So this right here requires
some type of lever mechanism.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.372
Yes.

12:36.374 --> 12:38.672
What does the engineer in you
say about this?

12:38.827 --> 12:40.352
It's incredibly impressive.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.385
You're right.
It would require

12:42.387 --> 12:45.559
many motivated people
over a long time.

12:45.581 --> 12:49.672
So what is the name of this?

12:49.827 --> 12:52.279
The name of these...
It's, of course, a giant tomb.

12:52.281 --> 12:55.332
- And the name is Sa Domu e S'orcu.
- And what does that mean?

12:55.487 --> 12:58.099
Sa domu: the house.
S'orcu: the ogre.

13:00.121 --> 13:01.432
So this is considered

13:01.607 --> 13:02.939
- a giant's tomb.
- Yes.

13:03.114 --> 13:05.725
Have any bones
been found inside?

13:05.881 --> 13:09.839
In many others, yes.
Not in this one, unfortunately.

13:09.861 --> 13:12.945
Although no bones
have been discovered

13:12.947 --> 13:14.819
within Sa Domu e S'orcu,

13:14.974 --> 13:17.645
many of the 800 tombs
on Sardinia

13:17.801 --> 13:20.899
were found to contain
ancient human remains.

13:22.961 --> 13:25.232
We found remarkably few

13:25.321 --> 13:27.065
human remains in these tombs.

13:27.221 --> 13:29.305
Perhaps in the 800 tombs
themselves

13:29.381 --> 13:32.679
we found maybe
100 skeletons of people.

13:32.721 --> 13:35.839
So, either the bones were
removed from the other ones

13:35.994 --> 13:37.899
or they were just never used.

13:38.054 --> 13:42.519
Archaeologists
of the world will contend

13:42.561 --> 13:45.392
that the tombs of the giants
in Sardinia

13:45.401 --> 13:47.859
could not possibly have
been built for giants

13:48.014 --> 13:50.425
because the bodies of giants

13:50.481 --> 13:51.817
simply couldn't fit
into the tombs;

13:51.841 --> 13:53.379
they weren't big enough.

13:53.534 --> 13:57.265
I personally went there,
measured the tombs myself.

13:57.421 --> 14:00.072
Even in the smaller tombs,

14:00.081 --> 14:03.305
you could fit a nine
to 12-foot giant.

14:03.361 --> 14:05.259
But they're missing the point.

14:05.281 --> 14:08.732
Instead, the body of the giant

14:08.841 --> 14:11.405
was buried beneath the tomb

14:11.461 --> 14:17.039
and then the edifice was raised
over the burial of the giant.

14:17.214 --> 14:19.832
So there are quite
a few accounts of giants

14:19.921 --> 14:22.466
throughout Sardinia
in many traditions,

14:22.468 --> 14:23.923
especially because
of the giants' tombs

14:23.947 --> 14:25.592
that exist all over the country.

14:25.747 --> 14:28.825
For example, in 1953,
it was reported

14:28.827 --> 14:31.912
that two over eight-foot-tall
skeletons were discovered

14:32.067 --> 14:35.652
in the area with grave goods
and bronze furnishings

14:35.807 --> 14:38.512
and other such things
actually within the tomb itself,

14:38.621 --> 14:42.072
suggesting that, indeed,
giants did exist in Sardinia.

14:42.227 --> 14:44.885
You know,
it's really fascinating

14:45.061 --> 14:47.085
that this is considered
the giant's structure

14:47.087 --> 14:50.219
because this is
not the only one.

14:50.241 --> 14:54.705
Your neighboring island Malta
has stories of giants.

14:54.707 --> 14:57.979
Greece has stories of the
Cyclops, which were also giants.

14:58.134 --> 15:00.252
You can go to South America.

15:00.341 --> 15:03.245
Tiahuanaco was considered
to have been built by giants.

15:03.301 --> 15:07.485
So worldwide we have
these stories of giants.

15:07.641 --> 15:12.765
So the idea that at some point
giants roamed the land...

15:12.767 --> 15:16.419
one has to wonder, were they at
some point all the same beings?

15:16.441 --> 15:19.132
- Yes.
- Enough talking.

15:19.134 --> 15:20.877
- Let's go have a look
inside this thing. Andiamo.

15:20.901 --> 15:24.879
I had no idea
of the amazing things

15:25.034 --> 15:27.105
that would await me
on the island.

15:27.261 --> 15:31.479
These megalithic structures,
the tombs of the giants,

15:31.481 --> 15:34.499
have become one of
the biggest puzzle pieces

15:34.501 --> 15:36.559
that I've encountered so far.

15:36.581 --> 15:39.405
- Wow.
- Very impressive.

15:39.461 --> 15:42.499
Look at the beautiful
construction.

15:45.061 --> 15:47.345
And look at the block.

15:47.501 --> 15:49.312
You see the big block on top?

15:49.467 --> 15:51.099
- Yeah.
- It's supposed to be

15:51.254 --> 15:55.345
the heaviest we do have here,
so about 12 tons and something.

15:55.347 --> 15:57.045
So this block right here

15:57.101 --> 15:58.852
- is estimated to be about 12 tons.
12 tons.

15:59.007 --> 16:01.852
Wow. And also this,

16:01.854 --> 16:05.319
what some may refer to as some
type of an altar or a niche.

16:05.474 --> 16:09.152
That was probably
something for votive offerings

16:09.307 --> 16:12.759
- or maybe ritual.
- Mm-hmm.

16:12.761 --> 16:15.039
I believe that some
of the tombs were designed

16:15.041 --> 16:20.039
for what the Nuragic culture
called the rite of incubation.

16:20.041 --> 16:24.465
Megalithic edifices were raised
over the bodies of the giants

16:24.467 --> 16:25.872
that were buried beneath,

16:25.961 --> 16:30.092
and then during
the rite of incubation,

16:30.247 --> 16:34.039
the young people would crawl
inside of the tombs,

16:34.061 --> 16:38.165
and then they would
spend the night

16:38.341 --> 16:42.125
and the purpose was that these
young people would incubate

16:42.301 --> 16:47.812
in order to absorb
the power, the prowess,

16:47.967 --> 16:50.492
the might of the entities

16:50.501 --> 16:53.972
that were buried
beneath the tombs:

16:53.974 --> 16:58.465
the mighty ones, the heroes,
the giants.

16:58.621 --> 17:03.205
So, actually, they put a lot
of attention in the shape.

17:03.381 --> 17:06.031
This definitely was preplanned.

17:06.186 --> 17:08.347
Here's what we all can agree on:
whoever built this had

17:08.454 --> 17:12.152
- a very strong inspiration
and/or motivation. -Yes.

17:12.154 --> 17:16.125
Did a race of
colossal beings really inhabit

17:16.281 --> 17:19.319
the island of Sardinia
centuries ago?

17:19.361 --> 17:23.179
And, if so,
were their origins Earthly

17:23.334 --> 17:25.979
or extraterrestrial?

17:30.494 --> 17:32.965
Scattered
throughout western Europe

17:32.967 --> 17:37.225
are more than 10,000 standing
stones known as menhirs.

17:37.381 --> 17:41.132
They are believed to date
back to prehistoric times,

17:41.134 --> 17:43.992
although their purpose
remains a mystery.

17:44.147 --> 17:49.439
Sardinia is home to hundreds
of these menhirs

17:49.461 --> 17:52.752
and ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos believes

17:52.841 --> 17:55.259
they may provide a key

17:55.434 --> 17:57.792
to understanding
the island's history.

17:57.794 --> 18:02.525
To this end, he and Oak Island
treasure hunter Marty Lagina

18:02.527 --> 18:06.039
have arranged to meet with
archeological guide Ivana Malu

18:06.194 --> 18:08.545
at the Menhir Museum in Laconi.

18:08.721 --> 18:13.119
Look at the very strange
circle with the spear.

18:13.274 --> 18:15.219
What do you think, Marty?
What is that?

18:15.374 --> 18:16.719
I'm not sure what that is

18:16.741 --> 18:18.225
and I'm not sure
what this is, either.

18:18.381 --> 18:21.852
Now, you tell me, please,
what should I be seeing?

18:21.854 --> 18:27.105
It's a guy going down...
to go into another dimension.

18:27.107 --> 18:31.159
Do not ask me where
or which other world.

18:31.161 --> 18:33.799
But he's going on a trip,
on a journey

18:33.954 --> 18:36.179
going from point "A"
to point "B."

18:36.181 --> 18:40.952
Whatever it really symbolizes,
it was very important.

18:41.127 --> 18:42.797
This took an enormous amount
of work, just this.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.632
I mean, it's very heavy.

18:44.807 --> 18:47.725
It-it's done in relief, which is
the hard way to do a carving.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.619
- I-I think it's, uh... -What
do you think that represents?

18:50.774 --> 18:53.892
We have people
with two wings on each side.

18:54.001 --> 18:55.259
You know, it's almost like
an early version

18:55.281 --> 18:57.919
of some type of an angel.

18:58.074 --> 19:01.692
I'm arguing that what
we are looking at here

19:01.801 --> 19:05.272
is someone visiting
from the sky.

19:05.274 --> 19:10.405
In the Bible, they were referred
to as "the watchers."

19:10.561 --> 19:13.392
The watchers?

19:13.394 --> 19:15.585
The so-called fallen angels

19:15.641 --> 19:18.899
as referred to
in the Bible's Old Testament?

19:18.941 --> 19:21.699
According to the Book of Daniel,

19:21.721 --> 19:24.665
as well as in the Apocryphal
Books of Enoch,

19:24.821 --> 19:28.085
God sent a group of angels,
referred to as "the watchers,"

19:28.241 --> 19:31.845
down to Earth
to watch over humankind.

19:32.001 --> 19:34.765
But the watchers went
against God's will

19:34.921 --> 19:37.192
and mated with human women,

19:37.194 --> 19:41.112
producing a race of giant
mutants known as Nephilim.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.599
They were called

19:42.621 --> 19:45.499
the mighty ones of old.

19:45.654 --> 19:48.685
They were physical giants.

19:48.761 --> 19:53.379
And they brought havoc and
destruction upon the Earth.

19:53.381 --> 19:57.792
And this is what led to God's
decision to bring the flood.

19:57.881 --> 20:02.112
Even though the Bible teaches us
that Noah and his family

20:02.267 --> 20:05.079
were the only humans
to survive the flood,

20:05.101 --> 20:07.872
ancient legends teach us
that there were others

20:08.027 --> 20:11.225
who did survive
in many other places.

20:11.281 --> 20:14.305
When we talk
about the term "Nephilim,"

20:14.461 --> 20:17.065
it is associated
with genetic hybrid entities.

20:17.067 --> 20:18.999
What this translates to me

20:19.041 --> 20:21.079
is that they were
part extraterrestrial.

20:21.234 --> 20:24.699
Part of that story involves
the great flood.

20:24.874 --> 20:28.292
So it's also possible that they
decided to set up new camps

20:28.447 --> 20:30.399
beyond the ones
that were destroyed.

20:30.421 --> 20:33.599
So we have to wonder

20:33.754 --> 20:37.412
if Sardinia, perhaps,
was a refuge for the Nephilim.

20:37.414 --> 20:40.479
You know what I find
beyond fascinating

20:40.521 --> 20:43.499
is this shape down here,

20:43.521 --> 20:46.739
which mainstream archeology
suggests is some type

20:46.914 --> 20:49.239
of a weapon,
some type of a dagger.

20:49.394 --> 20:51.799
Which makes perfect sense.

20:51.954 --> 20:57.272
But in conjunction with this
symbol right here, and that,

20:57.274 --> 21:00.019
one could argue that
this is a representation

21:00.021 --> 21:03.899
of some type of
misunderstood technology

21:03.901 --> 21:07.039
that illustrates
some type of a flying craft.

21:09.781 --> 21:11.752
Is it possible

21:11.927 --> 21:14.559
that the figures found
on Sardinia's menhirs

21:14.714 --> 21:17.359
represent not angels
sent from heaven,

21:17.514 --> 21:20.319
but extraterrestrial visitors?

21:20.474 --> 21:23.592
Beings that came in spaceships
from another world

21:23.747 --> 21:25.899
and then fathered
a race of giants?

21:29.821 --> 21:31.645
To see if there might be

21:31.801 --> 21:33.552
some compelling
physical evidence

21:33.707 --> 21:35.659
to support the theory
that Sardinia

21:35.814 --> 21:38.899
was once home to a race of
extraterrestrial giants...

21:39.074 --> 21:40.359
- Hello, sir.
- Ciao.

21:40.534 --> 21:42.259
- Ciao.
- ...Giorgio and Marty

21:42.414 --> 21:44.732
have decided to take a look

21:44.887 --> 21:46.412
at the oldest structure
on the island

21:46.501 --> 21:49.525
the way extraterrestrials
might have viewed it:

21:49.681 --> 21:52.799
from the sky.

21:58.561 --> 22:00.459
Giorgio, here it is.

22:02.707 --> 22:06.339
The stepped pyramid
known as Monte d'Accoddi

22:06.514 --> 22:08.892
was built around 4000 BC,

22:09.047 --> 22:12.839
but what purpose it served
remains a mystery.

22:12.841 --> 22:15.065
Does it remind you of anything
you've seen before?

22:15.221 --> 22:16.565
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

22:16.567 --> 22:18.125
Yeah, clearly, I mean,

22:18.201 --> 22:20.219
this looks like some type of
a stepped pyramid,

22:20.241 --> 22:23.925
almost like a ziggurat, which
you can find in Mesopotamia,

22:24.001 --> 22:27.459
which is very interesting,
because how is it possible

22:27.614 --> 22:32.285
that we have a step pyramid here
and in Mesopotamia?

22:32.287 --> 22:34.759
And also, even closer,

22:34.914 --> 22:38.899
you have something similar
in the Canary Islands,

22:39.054 --> 22:40.759
on the island of Tenerife.

22:44.894 --> 22:46.859
Archaeologists have discovered

22:47.034 --> 22:49.545
that the original structure
of Monte d'Accoddi

22:49.701 --> 22:52.045
was completely covered
with a layered mixture

22:52.201 --> 22:56.085
of earth and stone
around 2800 BC

22:56.241 --> 22:58.332
and that the platform underneath

22:58.334 --> 23:01.952
has evidence of
being exposed to fire.

23:01.954 --> 23:06.012
This has led some ancient
astronaut theorists to speculate

23:06.014 --> 23:08.572
that it may have served
a unique purpose

23:08.727 --> 23:11.119
for extraterrestrial visitors.

23:11.274 --> 23:13.592
It could be that,
in the ancient past,

23:13.594 --> 23:15.419
maybe these sites
were actually used

23:15.574 --> 23:18.779
as some type of loading dock
for spacecraft.

23:18.934 --> 23:21.439
The platform on top
is specifically situated

23:21.461 --> 23:23.719
to hold some type
of large craft.

23:23.874 --> 23:25.445
And the ramp was used

23:25.621 --> 23:27.805
to possibly load
or unload supplies.

23:27.961 --> 23:30.592
So we have to wonder
if this ancient ziggurat

23:30.594 --> 23:34.019
wasn't actually some type
of ancient space platform.

23:34.174 --> 23:36.659
Is it possible

23:36.814 --> 23:38.439
that we have a step pyramid here

23:38.594 --> 23:43.905
built in the likeness of
something that our ancestors saw

23:43.907 --> 23:45.939
and it impressed them very much,

23:45.941 --> 23:50.912
so that they were compelled
to build it in stone?

23:51.067 --> 23:55.199
You know, that's a very
interesting perspective.

23:55.201 --> 23:58.192
Were Sardinia's
architectural marvels

23:58.367 --> 24:01.445
really built
thousands of years ago

24:01.501 --> 24:05.379
to serve the needs
of a race of extraterrestrials?

24:05.554 --> 24:08.752
Or could they have been built
more recently,

24:08.754 --> 24:11.852
by early humans who witnessed
alien activity

24:12.007 --> 24:15.932
and then interpreted it
in ways they could comprehend?

24:16.021 --> 24:19.805
For Giorgio and other
ancient astronaut theorists,

24:19.807 --> 24:22.072
it is a question
that might be answered

24:22.074 --> 24:25.092
by examining
a mysterious structure

24:25.247 --> 24:27.292
that was built to track
celestial events

24:27.294 --> 24:29.119
with astonishing precision.

24:37.681 --> 24:39.865
Paulilatino, Sardinia.

24:40.021 --> 24:42.412
May 2018.

24:42.567 --> 24:44.087
- Here we go. -Are you excited?
- Yeah.

24:44.201 --> 24:46.752
- Oh, very. Very much so.
- Yes. So follow me, please.

24:46.907 --> 24:48.972
Giorgio Tsoukalos,
Marty Lagina,

24:49.147 --> 24:52.112
and archeological guide
Ivana Malu

24:52.114 --> 24:55.005
travel to the sacred
Well of Santa Cristina,

24:55.161 --> 24:56.732
an ancient structure
believed to have been built

24:56.734 --> 24:59.432
sometime around 1800 BC...

24:59.587 --> 25:02.725
Not for the purpose
of withdrawing water,

25:02.727 --> 25:05.565
but to track a very specific
celestial event

25:05.567 --> 25:07.399
with incredible precision.

25:07.401 --> 25:10.752
Upon their arrival,
they meet with

25:10.907 --> 25:14.805
archeoastronomer and author
Mauro Peppino Zedda.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.852
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, uh...

25:16.854 --> 25:18.654
- Yes. Yeah, prego.
- These are modern, right?

25:18.701 --> 25:19.599
- This is reproduction?
No, no, I mean it.

25:19.621 --> 25:20.701
No, I know, I know, I know.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.105
This is reproduction.

25:22.107 --> 25:23.350
It's what people say
when they are here.

25:23.374 --> 25:24.734
They say, oh, Ivana,
that's a fake.

25:24.781 --> 25:26.099
What is that here?

25:26.254 --> 25:28.285
Can you imagine the well here
is 3,000 years old?

25:28.441 --> 25:30.325
No, honestly,
these are the original stones?

25:30.327 --> 25:31.412
Really, believe me.

25:31.521 --> 25:32.972
- Wow.
- 100%.

25:33.061 --> 25:35.992
That is built to last
for the eternity.

25:36.147 --> 25:37.187
Well, this is spectacular.

25:39.347 --> 25:42.192
The Well
of Santa Cristina demonstrates

25:42.194 --> 25:45.992
such incredible masonry skill
that archaeologists struggle

25:46.147 --> 25:49.432
to explain how it was built
by so-called primitive people.

25:49.541 --> 25:52.479
Based on his years of research,

25:52.481 --> 25:55.279
Giorgio believes
that both the stonework

25:55.454 --> 25:58.445
and the well's connection
to celestial events

25:58.447 --> 26:00.799
may provide important clues
for the theory

26:00.954 --> 26:03.479
that a race of
extraterrestrial giants

26:03.501 --> 26:05.339
once inhabited the island.

26:07.014 --> 26:08.639
Do you want to touch
with your hand

26:08.794 --> 26:10.799
- the sophistication of the wall?
- Yes.

26:10.954 --> 26:12.432
- Yes.
- We want to go down there.

26:12.587 --> 26:13.957
- Let's go down...
- Yes, of course. We have to.

26:16.107 --> 26:18.059
You can touch it
with your hands.

26:22.594 --> 26:23.932
- Unbelievable.
- This is crazy.

26:24.087 --> 26:25.459
I mean, look at this.

26:25.614 --> 26:26.659
It is round.

26:26.701 --> 26:28.525
It's a perfect circle.

26:28.527 --> 26:31.099
You can't put
a piece of paper...

26:31.101 --> 26:33.179
There's no mortar used
to put this stuff together.

26:33.201 --> 26:35.159
I mean...

26:35.314 --> 26:37.159
- It's amazing.
- Incredibile è questo.

26:39.027 --> 26:41.232
Not only is it
constructed beautifully,

26:41.234 --> 26:44.219
the foundation is below
the water table, okay?

26:44.394 --> 26:46.125
That's very hard to do.

26:46.127 --> 26:48.699
I could tell you
from Oak Island...

26:48.874 --> 26:49.705
- Right?
- ...working in the water

26:49.861 --> 26:50.861
- is difficult.
- Yes.

26:50.927 --> 26:52.559
This is spectacular.

26:56.761 --> 26:58.039
And this cupola

26:58.194 --> 26:59.619
is really built

26:59.641 --> 27:02.665
to observe the Moon
in its highest light.

27:04.894 --> 27:05.999
Its maximum...

27:07.354 --> 27:08.799
I get it.

27:08.821 --> 27:11.545
...is every 18.6 years.

27:11.721 --> 27:13.885
The full Moon reflects its light

27:14.041 --> 27:16.199
in the deep water over there.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.872
What Ivana is describing

27:20.047 --> 27:24.152
is a celestial event known as
"The Lunar Standstill,"

27:24.327 --> 27:26.819
the time when the Moon reaches

27:26.974 --> 27:28.619
its highest point
in the night sky

27:28.794 --> 27:31.272
and appears to stay there
for hours

27:31.274 --> 27:33.679
until it finally descends.

27:33.834 --> 27:36.179
But how was
an ancient civilization,

27:36.334 --> 27:38.545
supposedly one
without mathematics

27:38.601 --> 27:40.319
or even a written language,

27:40.341 --> 27:44.419
able to conceive of such
a precise and ingenious method

27:44.421 --> 27:47.599
of tracking such a rare
lunar cycle,

27:47.774 --> 27:50.072
one that likely occurred
no more than once or twice

27:50.074 --> 27:51.899
in an average lifetime?

27:54.474 --> 27:56.050
The question is,
there was no written language.

27:56.074 --> 27:58.645
How was this planned?

28:01.201 --> 28:03.825
You can...
You can build without any plan.

28:03.827 --> 28:05.579
Even if you are not
an architect, he said.

28:05.734 --> 28:07.719
You're gonna build your house
without a blueprint?

28:07.761 --> 28:09.719
No.

28:09.894 --> 28:11.245
No.

28:11.247 --> 28:13.799
Well, clearly, someone
told the local people

28:13.801 --> 28:18.865
how to place these stones
into different areas

28:18.867 --> 28:23.332
because it was a connection
to the celestial realm.

28:23.507 --> 28:27.225
And then, afterwards,
this became a place of worship.

28:27.381 --> 28:28.779
The place of worship only begins

28:28.934 --> 28:31.399
after something
extraordinary happens,

28:31.554 --> 28:33.725
- not before.
- So you're surmising

28:33.901 --> 28:35.699
the technology was given
to these people.

28:35.854 --> 28:37.699
- The engineering knowledge.
- Yeah.

28:37.854 --> 28:40.272
Because this screams
mathematics.

28:40.427 --> 28:41.845
Yes, it does.

28:42.001 --> 28:44.805
I will certainly concur
to this extent:

28:44.807 --> 28:48.965
someone or some ones had
extraordinary knowledge here.

28:48.967 --> 28:51.219
- This is not easy to build.
- No.

28:51.374 --> 28:53.332
Is it possible

28:53.487 --> 28:56.192
that someone gave
the ancient Sardinians

28:56.194 --> 28:58.799
highly advanced
engineering knowledge

28:58.954 --> 29:02.152
and that that knowledge
was passed down,

29:02.154 --> 29:05.659
generation by generation,
for thousands of years?

29:05.681 --> 29:09.399
But if so, where did that
knowledge originate?

29:09.554 --> 29:11.032
My suggestion is

29:11.034 --> 29:13.165
this engineering knowledge

29:13.241 --> 29:15.605
was given to the local culture

29:15.607 --> 29:17.945
at the time
by the extraterrestrials.

29:17.947 --> 29:19.999
I am not saying this lightly.

29:20.041 --> 29:21.739
I am only saying this because

29:21.894 --> 29:24.879
the legends and the statuary

29:24.921 --> 29:27.659
that have been found here
all speak

29:27.661 --> 29:30.039
of someone descending
from the sky.

29:33.121 --> 29:35.445
Why would otherworldly beings

29:35.601 --> 29:38.665
teach the ancient Sardinians
to accurately track

29:38.721 --> 29:43.639
a lunar phenomenon that only
occurs every 18.6 years?

29:43.794 --> 29:47.505
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

29:47.561 --> 29:49.545
that the answers can be found

29:49.601 --> 29:52.045
in the Biblical story
of the Nephilim,

29:52.201 --> 29:54.432
the strange race of giants

29:54.434 --> 29:56.752
that were the offspring
of the fallen angels

29:56.907 --> 29:58.665
and human women.

29:58.667 --> 30:01.359
It is known that
the Nephilim studied astronomy.

30:01.534 --> 30:04.185
They studied the Moon cycles,
the solar cycles,

30:04.341 --> 30:06.719
astrology, architecture.

30:06.741 --> 30:09.525
And, obviously, Sardinia could
have been one of the places

30:09.681 --> 30:11.825
where this knowledge ended up.

30:11.827 --> 30:14.559
Is it possible that the Nephilim

30:14.581 --> 30:18.485
of the Bible taught humanity

30:18.641 --> 30:24.979
the knowledge of
the 18.61-year lunar cycle?

30:24.981 --> 30:27.932
And the answer
could actually be yes.

30:28.087 --> 30:32.285
The Bible says
that they were destroyed

30:32.361 --> 30:36.559
in a cataclysm
that involved a deluge.

30:40.181 --> 30:44.332
But did any of them
survive this deluge?

30:44.334 --> 30:46.999
Well, the Bible tells us
that they did.

30:47.154 --> 30:49.719
It's an interesting idea

30:49.741 --> 30:52.719
that survivors of the flood
moved from the Middle East

30:52.761 --> 30:55.119
to Sardinia.

30:55.294 --> 30:58.645
And that Sardinia became a
special refuge for the Nephilim,

30:58.821 --> 31:00.739
for these giants,

31:00.894 --> 31:05.292
and they installed
a Moon-worshipping culture.

31:05.381 --> 31:08.165
Is the Well of Santa Cristina

31:08.221 --> 31:10.479
evidence that
the ancient Nuragic people

31:10.634 --> 31:13.125
came into contact
with giant beings

31:13.181 --> 31:16.125
described in the Bible
as the Nephilim?

31:16.301 --> 31:20.552
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

31:20.727 --> 31:23.972
and suggest that other
structures exist in Sardinia

31:24.081 --> 31:27.612
that point to the exact origins
of both the Nephilim

31:27.767 --> 31:31.379
and their
extraterrestrial ancestors.

31:39.087 --> 31:41.992
Of the many
mysterious stone carvings

31:42.167 --> 31:44.819
and structures found
throughout Sardinia,

31:44.841 --> 31:47.512
perhaps the most confounding

31:47.667 --> 31:50.065
are the thousands
of megalithic towers

31:50.067 --> 31:52.292
that dot the island's landscape.

31:52.401 --> 31:55.599
The structures,
known as nuraghe,

31:55.754 --> 31:58.072
stand as architectural marvels,

31:58.074 --> 32:01.579
each constructed
using colossal stones

32:01.621 --> 32:04.779
and held together
without the use of mortar.

32:07.041 --> 32:09.719
The conventional narrative,

32:09.741 --> 32:12.865
concerning the purpose
of these towers,

32:12.867 --> 32:17.152
is that they were constructed
as fortifications.

32:17.327 --> 32:20.785
How do you build 30,000 towers

32:20.961 --> 32:24.245
employing all of the equipment

32:24.401 --> 32:26.525
and manpower that implies,

32:26.601 --> 32:29.412
and yet still continue to farm,

32:29.414 --> 32:31.905
still continue
to defend yourself

32:31.981 --> 32:33.652
while you're building
these towers?

32:33.654 --> 32:37.625
To investigate
the nuraghe firsthand,

32:37.627 --> 32:39.932
Giorgio Tsoukalos
and Marty Lagina

32:40.087 --> 32:43.052
traveled with archeological
guide Ivana Malu

32:43.207 --> 32:46.072
to the nuraghe of Santu Antine,

32:46.227 --> 32:48.419
one of the largest
on the island.

32:48.441 --> 32:51.739
- Let's go inside. -Yes.
- Let's do that.

32:51.741 --> 32:54.379
Is it possible that
these colossal stone structures

32:54.534 --> 32:56.365
are, in some way,

32:56.367 --> 32:59.505
linked to the numerous
mythological tales of giants,

32:59.507 --> 33:03.665
whom many believe lived here
thousands of years ago?

33:03.841 --> 33:05.619
I'll show you the way.

33:05.621 --> 33:07.952
Wow, Ivana, this is...
this is...

33:08.127 --> 33:09.599
Wow, look at this.

33:09.754 --> 33:11.665
- This is impressive.
- Look at this.

33:11.821 --> 33:14.799
This is only one nuraghe
in 8,000 we found in Sardinia,

33:14.801 --> 33:18.012
- which has three niches...
- Mm-hmm.

33:18.167 --> 33:21.112
...connected by a tunnel.

33:21.114 --> 33:24.272
I mean, this
is absolutely crazy.

33:24.427 --> 33:27.265
Huh.

33:27.321 --> 33:29.505
Look at the size
of these blocks.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.430
I mean, that one right there
is a minimum of one ton,

33:31.454 --> 33:33.192
- I'm sure.
- Yeah.

33:33.194 --> 33:34.625
The effort to create
this is extraordinary,

33:34.627 --> 33:37.265
absolutely extraordinary.

33:37.341 --> 33:38.939
And I think it was made by

33:38.941 --> 33:41.379
a very advanced society,
in some senses,

33:41.534 --> 33:44.319
which is to say, where's
the knowledge come from, right?

33:44.494 --> 33:45.494
Right, because clearly...

33:45.534 --> 33:46.819
This is not a simple structure.

33:46.974 --> 33:48.799
And this is interesting because

33:48.954 --> 33:53.659
there are other places around
the world with similar masonry,

33:53.814 --> 33:57.539
so you have to wonder
what's going on.

33:57.561 --> 33:59.692
So Giorgio, we've been in here
now for awhile.

33:59.694 --> 34:02.212
What's your best idea,
what is this?

34:02.214 --> 34:03.812
Well, some have suggested

34:03.967 --> 34:07.972
that these places here
are in correspondence

34:08.147 --> 34:10.952
to some constellations,
such as the Pleiades.

34:10.954 --> 34:14.212
According to the work
of Italian author

34:14.214 --> 34:17.125
and archaeologist Augusto Mulas

34:17.127 --> 34:19.371
the constellation
known as the Pleiades

34:19.527 --> 34:22.645
has played an important role
in religious rituals

34:22.821 --> 34:27.331
for thousands of years,
particularly in ancient Babylon.

34:27.420 --> 34:31.512
He also observed that,
when viewed from the air,

34:31.687 --> 34:35.592
the nuraghe at Santu Antine
was one of seven that,

34:35.681 --> 34:37.371
when looked at together,

34:37.481 --> 34:39.965
precisely matched the
configuration of the stars

34:40.121 --> 34:42.052
of the Pleiades.

34:42.141 --> 34:44.525
But why?

34:44.681 --> 34:46.512
Could it be connected
in some way

34:46.601 --> 34:49.998
to the ancient Babylonian
stories of the Anunnaki,

34:50.154 --> 34:51.732
the winged giants who,

34:51.887 --> 34:54.212
as depicted in numerous
ancient carvings,

34:54.367 --> 34:57.272
suggest an eerie connection
to the so-called "watchers"

34:57.427 --> 34:59.232
referenced in the Bible?

34:59.407 --> 35:02.332
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

35:02.507 --> 35:06.112
the answer is a profound yes,
but they also cite

35:06.287 --> 35:10.025
numerous other connections
between ancient civilizations

35:10.201 --> 35:12.745
and the Pleiades constellation.

35:12.901 --> 35:15.519
The Pleiades are
a very special star group

35:15.561 --> 35:17.345
to numerous ancient cultures,

35:17.347 --> 35:20.212
including the Maya
and the Cherokee and others,

35:20.367 --> 35:22.219
who believed that
it was a place from whence

35:22.394 --> 35:25.345
our creators originated...
That, in fact, beings have been

35:25.501 --> 35:28.899
coming and going
from the Pleiades for millennia.

35:29.054 --> 35:31.712
But you have to wonder, with
this connection in Sardinia,

35:31.714 --> 35:33.445
perhaps the inhabitants
of Sardinia

35:33.601 --> 35:34.792
were actually in contact

35:34.794 --> 35:36.859
with beings from the Pleiades.

35:36.861 --> 35:40.405
I think it's really fascinating

35:40.581 --> 35:42.170
that these nuraghes
are actually representations

35:42.194 --> 35:45.845
of a certain section in the,
in the night sky,

35:45.847 --> 35:48.992
and so, you know, maybe that
was the calling card

35:49.147 --> 35:50.545
by the extraterrestrials

35:50.547 --> 35:54.272
in order to show
where they came from.

35:54.427 --> 35:56.585
- A sort of map.
- Exactly.

35:56.761 --> 35:58.532
Here it is, surviving
after 3,000 years.

35:58.534 --> 36:01.379
Are any of the buildings
we're creating today

36:01.381 --> 36:03.501
- gonna last that long?
- Oh, that's a great question.

36:03.567 --> 36:04.812
I doubt it.

36:04.987 --> 36:06.079
All of these structures

36:06.234 --> 36:09.359
were built in a megalithic style

36:09.361 --> 36:11.412
for a future generation
that would understand

36:11.414 --> 36:14.479
the discrepancy in logic.

36:16.754 --> 36:19.845
If Sardinia really
was home to a race of giants,

36:20.021 --> 36:21.445
who were they?

36:21.501 --> 36:24.345
Could they have been
the Nephilim,

36:24.521 --> 36:26.945
the hybrid children
of the so-called "watchers"?

36:27.001 --> 36:31.059
But if so,
what happened to them?

36:31.081 --> 36:34.032
Were they destroyed
by the great flood?

36:34.141 --> 36:37.199
Or did some of them survive,

36:37.221 --> 36:39.052
living out their last days

36:39.061 --> 36:41.259
on a remote island
in the Mediterranean?

36:47.974 --> 36:49.512
For centuries,

36:49.667 --> 36:52.519
visitors to the Mediterranean
island of Sardinia

36:52.674 --> 36:55.919
have been greeted with strange
and mysterious stories

36:55.941 --> 37:00.425
that a race of giants once lived
there, thousands of years ago.

37:00.501 --> 37:02.912
But other than the presence

37:03.067 --> 37:05.972
of hundreds of bizarre
monolithic stone structures,

37:06.127 --> 37:08.892
there had been little
physical evidence

37:09.047 --> 37:11.219
after 1953 to convince

37:11.374 --> 37:13.772
mainstream archaeologists,

37:13.927 --> 37:16.479
or even ancient
astronaut theorists,

37:16.634 --> 37:20.439
that the myths about giants
ever had a basis in reality.

37:20.481 --> 37:24.652
That is, until 1979,

37:24.807 --> 37:27.492
when more giant bones
were reportedly discovered

37:27.494 --> 37:32.245
during one of the island's
many archaeological excavations.

37:32.401 --> 37:35.025
I interviewed two individuals

37:35.027 --> 37:37.932
who worked on the excavation
of the Nuragic ruins

37:38.041 --> 37:39.632
in the town of Sardara,

37:39.634 --> 37:42.765
underneath the Church
of Sant'Anastasia.

37:42.921 --> 37:44.525
Both of these individuals
dug up,

37:44.581 --> 37:47.445
at different periods of time,

37:47.621 --> 37:51.259
multiple skeletons of giants,
from nine to 12 feet tall.

37:51.434 --> 37:54.779
And then the bones of the giants

37:54.934 --> 37:58.639
would go into the church
and then disappear overnight.

37:58.794 --> 38:01.999
There have been hundreds
of excavations

38:02.001 --> 38:06.239
in which the bones of giants
have been allegedly unearthed

38:06.261 --> 38:08.359
and then secreted away.

38:08.401 --> 38:11.772
Before we left
the island of Sardinia,

38:11.927 --> 38:15.505
Marty and I were supposed
to finally get access

38:15.561 --> 38:17.772
to an actual giant bone.

38:17.861 --> 38:19.979
That was all set,

38:20.154 --> 38:22.259
and then we received
notifications

38:22.281 --> 38:25.059
that the guy pulled out,

38:25.081 --> 38:28.252
and he was not going to show us
the giant bone.

38:28.254 --> 38:31.445
Why did he pull out?

38:31.601 --> 38:34.665
One could argue that some type
of censorship

38:34.667 --> 38:36.499
is going on in Sardinia.

38:36.674 --> 38:39.352
Censorship?

38:39.507 --> 38:41.659
Is it possible
that physical evidence

38:41.661 --> 38:43.079
that could help prove
that giants

38:43.081 --> 38:46.385
once inhabited
the island of Sardinia

38:46.541 --> 38:48.272
has been deliberately
hidden away?

38:48.274 --> 38:51.779
But, if so, by whom? And why?

38:54.347 --> 38:57.059
As far as Giorgio and Marty
are concerned,

38:57.214 --> 38:59.239
that is just one
of the many questions

38:59.394 --> 39:02.445
still left unanswered
by their trip.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.099
Hey, I want to ask you this,

39:05.274 --> 39:08.845
did ancient astronauts
visit Sardinia?

39:08.921 --> 39:12.232
I think there is no doubt
that extraterrestrials

39:12.407 --> 39:15.172
visited Sardinia
in ancient times

39:15.174 --> 39:17.819
because there are similar

39:17.974 --> 39:21.005
megalithic structures

39:21.007 --> 39:23.125
of inexplicable origin

39:23.301 --> 39:25.443
- elsewhere on the planet.
- Right, 'cause it's a piece

39:25.467 --> 39:27.212
of what you've seen
elsewhere. Okay.

39:27.214 --> 39:29.959
- Yes, it adds to the bigger picture.
- Yeah, okay.

39:29.961 --> 39:32.985
Our ancestors were all visited
by the same teachers.

39:33.141 --> 39:34.772
You know what?
I respect that immensely

39:34.927 --> 39:36.439
because I think
that's the correct

39:36.594 --> 39:38.399
scientific way
to go about things.

39:38.554 --> 39:39.899
You start with a supposition,

39:40.054 --> 39:41.739
and then put it
to the reality test,

39:41.894 --> 39:43.145
put it to the real world,

39:43.147 --> 39:45.372
put it to the evidence.
I want to become

39:45.527 --> 39:47.059
convinced by the data.

39:47.081 --> 39:49.079
Well, if I have accomplished
anything with you,

39:49.234 --> 39:53.625
I hope that you continue looking
at other places and be like,

39:53.627 --> 39:56.605
"You know, that Giorgio guy,
he has a point."

39:56.661 --> 39:58.119
You want me to be convinced.

39:58.294 --> 40:00.945
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah. And that's a key point.

40:01.001 --> 40:03.565
You look me in the eye
and you say, "You know what",

40:03.641 --> 40:05.245
"I am convinced
that ancient astronauts

40:05.401 --> 40:07.759
"visited this planet
and sowed the seeds

40:07.914 --> 40:09.865
of what inspired people
to build these things."

40:10.041 --> 40:11.819
I can't prove you wrong, okay?

40:11.994 --> 40:13.259
I can't.

40:13.434 --> 40:16.319
And I don't anybody
who can do that.

40:16.494 --> 40:18.125
So the book is still open.

40:18.127 --> 40:19.572
Yes, and I hope you will read
the next chapter.

40:19.574 --> 40:21.012
You write it,
I'll read it, okay?

40:21.167 --> 40:22.979
I'll read it.

40:23.134 --> 40:26.465
The way you prove

40:26.641 --> 40:28.352
the ancient astronaut theory

40:28.527 --> 40:31.405
is not with one single piece
of evidence.

40:31.407 --> 40:35.399
It is a conglomeration
of different puzzle pieces,

40:35.421 --> 40:40.119
and Sardinia... you have
structures that are incredible,

40:40.294 --> 40:43.485
you have the stories of giants,

40:43.641 --> 40:47.825
and you have these statues
that look like giants.

40:47.827 --> 40:50.332
And you have to wonder,
is it possible

40:50.441 --> 40:52.859
that Sardinia, at some point,

40:52.901 --> 40:55.245
was visited
by extraterrestrials?

40:55.421 --> 40:59.272
Am I sold on it?
Absolutely not.

40:59.447 --> 41:01.605
But would I dismiss it
out of hand?

41:01.607 --> 41:04.392
No, because I think
that would be

41:04.394 --> 41:06.432
probably just as bad an error.

41:06.607 --> 41:10.379
We don't know what happened
everywhere on this planet.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.939
And another thing is
we don't know

41:12.941 --> 41:14.759
whether we're alone
in this universe.

41:14.914 --> 41:17.759
It seems to me unlikely.

41:17.801 --> 41:20.565
Perhaps somewhere,

41:20.621 --> 41:23.479
deep beneath the ancient ruins
of Sardinia,

41:23.501 --> 41:26.439
lie the remains
of a race of ancient beings,

41:26.461 --> 41:30.912
part man, part extraterrestrial.

41:31.021 --> 41:34.512
And if physical evidence
is ever found,

41:34.667 --> 41:37.385
will it tell us about
humankind's incredible past,

41:37.441 --> 41:41.012
or will it reveal our future?

41:41.014 --> 41:44.745
A future where we will return
to the very stars

41:44.747 --> 41:48.985
we may have come from
thousands of years ago?
