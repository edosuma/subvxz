53:09.520 --> 53:11.000
I don't even know when I should retire.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.232
I don't know whether I should announce
I'm going to retire at the end of the year?

53:14.320 --> 53:15.320
I don't.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.511
You know, should I retire when
I ride my two hundredth winner,

53:18.960 --> 53:24.354
or just retire in a week's time or
six weeks' time or two months' time?

53:24.720 --> 53:28.270
ROBERTS: Personally for me,
I would like to go out on a winner.

53:28.440 --> 53:32.673
- What have you got now one, nine...
- 182, was it?

53:32.760 --> 53:37.596
ROBERTS: 184, I think... So say you said
that on the two hundredth you announce it...

53:37.680 --> 53:38.680
CHANELLE: Mmm-hmm.

53:38.760 --> 53:42.231
ROBERTS: So on a normal run of things,
16 winners.

53:42.640 --> 53:44.836
Announcing it on

53:45.600 --> 53:48.354
February 14th, 15th, around that time.

53:48.840 --> 53:50.718
CHANELLE: Be the same as the
4,000 winners, you were on tour

53:50.800 --> 53:51.800
for like three or four days.

53:51.880 --> 53:55.715
Like I am, just because
it's the right thing to do,

53:55.960 --> 53:59.317
I will hopefully retire on one of
JonJo's horses that JP owns.

53:59.400 --> 54:01.232
ROBERTS: Yeah. So it should be on
the green and gold colours.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.516
MCCOY: It's got to be one of JonJo's in
the green and gold colours.

54:03.600 --> 54:04.795
ROBERTS: Yeah, exactly.

54:05.040 --> 54:06.040
I'm not shocked.

54:08.040 --> 54:12.193
I'm upset because it's the end
of a great story if you want to

54:12.280 --> 54:15.512
look it like that, but then
in the cold light of day,

54:15.920 --> 54:19.072
what we've achieved, as I say, I...
Whether you agree with me or not,

54:19.160 --> 54:22.756
no one will... No one will do that,
it's not possible.

54:22.840 --> 54:23.840
MCCOY: Mmm.

54:23.920 --> 54:28.278
ROBERTS: For someone to ride 2000 winners,
they've got to ride for 20 years,

54:28.560 --> 54:30.552
and ride 100 winners a year, for 20 years.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.599
That's half of what you've got.

54:34.080 --> 54:35.080
I think.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.958
So that's the plan. I think 200 is good.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.350
ROBERTS: Yeah. No, I think 200 is right.
Definitely.

54:39.880 --> 54:41.314
CHANELLE: I think it's a good decision.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.551
- ROBERTS: To me it feels right.

54:43.640 --> 54:45.359
Let's just agree upon, I'll say. (LAUGHS)

54:45.440 --> 54:48.831
I... I think it feels right,
I actually think it feels right.

54:48.920 --> 54:51.196
I actually feel happy now that
I've spoke about it.

54:51.960 --> 54:54.634
I think once you get to that 200,
you announce it,

54:54.720 --> 54:55.949
and then the...

54:56.120 --> 54:59.670
I think it'll take a lot of pressure,
takes it... It's there, it's done.

54:59.760 --> 55:01.479
- Yeah.
- You know.

55:01.560 --> 55:03.438
I... I think there will
be a bit of relief...

55:03.680 --> 55:04.875
- Yeah.
- That I've been able to...

55:05.720 --> 55:07.598

Not the face of peanut butter,

I don't know it's like 40 miles or
something. They have to race against a horse

now is the time you have to spit it out.</i>

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.716
MALE VOICE ON PA: <i>Well, it's a day
we've all been looking forward to.</i>

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:46.272
<i>The start of the festival.
The biggest event of its type in the sport,</i>

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.432
<i>with four days of the most
brilliant racing in prospect.</i>

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:52.399
<i>But there's going to be
a strange feel about this year's festival.</i>

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.200
<i>Because we all... It's going to be
the last time we're going to see</i>

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:57.272
<i>AP, the champ in action...</i>

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.239
MCCOY: <i>There is nowhere,
nowhere like Cheltenham,</i>

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.310
<i>and as a Jockey, you'll always be judged on
the amount of winners you rode there.</i>

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.756
SPORTS INTERVIEWER: <i>There's been
so much written, Tony, about this week</i>

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.753
and you in particular because
it will be your final festival.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:13.958
Has that in anyway affected your
preparations or thinking?

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.751
Um, not really to be
honest, I'm quite lucky,

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.073
<i>that whenever I get out on a horse,
then I'm pretty much on my own anyway.</i>

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.154
<i>So I'm quite good at blanking it all out.
It'll be a little different this year</i>

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.199
<i>obviously because I know that this is
the last chance really</i>

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:31.557
<i>and it's going to be very different than
it ever has been before,</i>

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:35.236
<i>so I'm going to try and enjoy it but
it's like any sport,</i>

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.630
<i>it's a lot easier to enjoy it
when you're winning, so...</i>

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.989
<i>It's important to try and win.</i>

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:42.830
Tony, many thanks indeed. That'll be all.
The great legendary Tony McCoy.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:46.197
He really is up there with some
of the greatest sportsmen in the world

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:49.478
and of course all eyes will be on him
at Cheltenham this week

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.076
and should he ride further winners here,
it literally will bring the house down.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.519
BARRY GERAGHTY: <i>Twelve o'clock
on Tuesday at Cheltenham,</i>

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.080
<i>especially for the first race,</i>

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:04.910
<i>you could hear a pin drop,
but once it gets started</i>

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.960
<i>and the first winner's in,
it becomes business as usual again.</i>

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.955
<i>And obviously the highs are higher
and the lows are lower.</i>

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:19.274
RUBY: <i>It's high pressure, tense,
it's what can define a year for everyone.</i>

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:25.911
<i>A winner there means a hell of a lot
and you have to be mentally tough</i>

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.199
<i>going to Cheltenham, because
however how much success you have there,</i>

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:33.757
<i>there's going to be more disappointments
than there is delight.</i>

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.392
RICHARD: <i>The pressure is slightly
more on you for those four days.</i>

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:41.997
<i>And it can be a very long week if things
don't go, you know, go your way,</i>

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.720
<i>it can be the longest
week of the year I think.</i>

SPORTS COMMENTATOR: <i>Here it becomes
a real reality</i>

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.832

Cheltenham. No other place in the world,</i>

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:53.277

it's wonderful.</i>

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.869
MAN: <i>For AP he knows, he ain't going to get
another chance,</i>

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.475
<i>this is it. And if he
doesn't ride a winner here,</i>

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:02.714
<i>he will never be able to go back there
and that will... That will haunt.</i>

WALSH: <i>What will you notice, in Cheltenham,</i>

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:51.670

MCCOY: <i>You know I came into the week
with a few chances</i>

<i>Well, you just got to keep your head down</i>

the season and I'm lucky I can go out again</i>

another go. So I'm just going</i>

what's left of it anyways.</i>

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.638
SPORTS COMMENTATOR: <i>His valets,
this morning, were telling us</i>

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.154
<i>on the morning line
like Chris Board was saying,</i>

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.709
<i>that he's just been a bit more subdued
this week, very reflective,</i>

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:30.555
<i>as he, is trying to take it all in
at his last festival, in that way.</i>

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.518
<i>It must be a very odd experience for him.</i>

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.391
He's very melancholic this week.
He hasn't had a winner.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:44.471
We've had two days gone
and I didn't realise going into Cheltenham

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.560
how much he desperately wanted a winner.

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.553
He said, "I know I've got nothing to prove
going into Cheltenham, but..."

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:56.590
But he said, "This year, more than any year,
in Cheltenham," he said, "I want a winner.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.798
"I just want to walk into that winner's
enclosure one more time

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.553
"and punch the air before I retire."

SPORTS COMMENTATOR: <i>So swinging
round the top turn</i>

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.913
<i>and onto towards the next and open ditch,
it's six out</i>

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.520
<i>and here's the champion jockey on Uxziandre
who flies over with a growing lead again.</i>

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.510
<i>And the pace looks

from the finish.</i>

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.712
<i>Uxziandre, can he just try to save a little
bit, as they reach the top of the hill.</i>

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:17.639
<i>Three fences to jump, it's AP on Uxziandre,

in the red and yellow.</i>

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.952

<i>These are the ones that count
as they race to the second last</i>

01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.472
<i>Coming to the final fence, can Uxziandre
hold on for AP McCoy? Over safely.</i>

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.833
<i>Now they go up the hill, Uxziandre went
very fast from the outset.</i>

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.637

<i>Horse and rider in perfect rhythm,
Uxziandre attacking every fence,</i>

Yeah. If Shut The Front Door could
do the same, that would be all right.

MCCOY: <i>I think a lot of the time
Chanelle would think that,</i>

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.358
<i>that I was a lot more
interested in my career</i>

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.033
<i>than I was in my relationship</i>

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.999
<i>- and in some ways she was right.</i>
- (CHEERING)

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:19.840
<i>Yet, in some ways she was right
which is not a good thing.</i>

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:22.520
<i>Luckily, she stuck it out.</i>

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.160
<i>I pinch myself every morning.
I'm a very lucky person...</i>

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:30.839
<i>That she... That she stuck with it.</i>

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.592
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:38.192
You better enjoy every
minute of it, enjoy it.

01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.950
MCCOY: <i>It's what made me happy,
it's what I wanted to do.</i>

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.632
<i>Obviously there was times it drove me mad,</i>

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:59.197
<i>but in a contradictory way
it's what floated my boat.</i>

01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.993
<i>And the more you win,
the more you want to win,</i>

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:05.151
<i>the more that the need becomes greed</i>

01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.597
<i>and I think, I think you
have to be like that.</i>

01:30:10.680 --> 01:30:12.717
COMMENTATOR: <i>We saw him
walking out for the last ride</i>

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.519
<i>and the smile was a little more forced,</i>

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:17.078
<i>because he knows
that this extraordinary career,</i>

01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.551
<i>his way of life in a sense,
is going to come to an end.</i>

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.713
Sweetheart, enjoy watching this race.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:24.359
This is Daddy's last race ever.

01:30:25.880 --> 01:30:28.475
CHANELLE: Archie, you have no idea
what's going on, have you?

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.560
Yeah.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:33.235
He'll watch this when he's like 21.

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.519
COMMENTATOR: <i>Let's remember that,
a celebration of a great career,</i>

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:39.193
<i>but we want the headlines,</i>

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:42.114
<i>we want the Box Office
to give him the perfect send off</i>

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:44.669
<i>here, in the silks of JP McManus.</i>

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.472
School, he's gonna do school runs.

01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:49.912
Has anyone backed him by the way?

01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:53.956
COMMENTATOR: <i>They jump away
and there's a cheer from the grandstand</i>

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.560
<i>even though there in the back straight,</i>

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.873
<i>raving black box office jumping
just in the midfield on the inside.</i>

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:01.713
<i>Green yellow hoops, white cap.</i>

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.480
CHANELLE: <i>I remember
coming home one evening</i>

01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:12.679
<i>and he was sitting there
just sobbing, absolutely sobbing,</i>

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.150
<i>because he was so petrified</i>

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.755
<i>that he wasn't going to be
champion jockey the next year.</i>

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:28.473
<i>It was like looking at somebody
who was living in fear of themselves.</i>

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.916
(COMMENTATOR INDISTINCTLY TALKING)

01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.318
MCCOY: <i>I used to think the demons
had Olympic games</i>

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.675
<i>in my head sometimes,</i>

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:53.999
<i>but at the same time
in a crazy, mad kind of way</i>

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.594
<i>it's obviously what made me happy.</i>

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.000
<i>It's obviously what made me happy...</i>

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.799
<i>Torturing myself,</i>

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:07.076
<i>trying to figure out why that
every time I went out on a horse,</i>

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.755
<i>I didn't win, I could
never figure that out.</i>

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.033
<i>Maybe I thought if I could work that out,</i>

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.315
<i>then I would have been content.</i>

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:22.111
<i>'Cause it's slowly started to register
that maybe it wasn't possible after all.</i>

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.954
C'mon champ.

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:30.156
CHANELLE: <i>I mean,
I wouldn't change it for the world</i>

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:33.595
<i>because it's made him
the person he is today.</i>

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:35.873
- Come on, honey.
- Come on!

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:38.920
CHANELLE: <i>And it's made us the couple
we are today.</i>

01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:42.120
COMMENTATOR: <i>He will have to perform
just one more final miracle.</i>

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.157
<i>And it doesn't look like it's happening...</i>

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:48.680
Come on, Anthony! Come on!

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.635
Come on, honey.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.792
(COMMENTATOR CONTINUES TALKING)

01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:03.396
<i>MCoy, who's won so many championships,
he gets the win.</i>

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.957
I'm so jealous, I'm so jealous.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.719
Enjoy. Enjoy, you deserve it, brother.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.477
COMMENTATOR:
<i>Dave Roberts, his agent,</i>

<i>for 21 years, here in Great Britain,</i>

(CROWD CHEERING)

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.880
MCCOY: <i>That is the end.</i>

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.477
<i>That's it, it's, it's...
It's gone. It's over.</i>

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:18.872
<i>As a professional jockey
I'm never going to ride a race again.</i>

<i>I'm a has-been, I'm a
retired sports person.</i>

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.760
<i>I don't see it as a second life,</i>

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.270
<i>I probably see it more
as a first life really,</i>

<i>the last was more a dream
then a life really...</i>

01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:47.713
<i>And I just woke up.</i>

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:53.516
<i>So I might have lived a dream
but I'm awake now.</i>
