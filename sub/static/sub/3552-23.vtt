WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:03.703
SUSAN HAD A SECRET.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.176
HAVE YOU TOLD THE GIRLS
YOU'RE MOVING?

00:05.176 --> 00:06.107
NOT YET.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.138
I GOT AN OFFER
ON YOUR HOUSE.

00:08.138 --> 00:10.611
CARLOS AND GABY
GOT COMPETITIVE.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.343
(kisses) I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

00:12.343 --> 00:14.145
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA. I CAN'T TAKE
THE GIRLS TO SCHOOL.

00:14.145 --> 00:15.286
YOU ALWAYS TAKE THEM.

00:15.286 --> 00:16.487
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK
EARLY TODAY.

00:16.487 --> 00:18.149
WELL, I'M AT WORK
RIGHT NOW.

00:18.149 --> 00:20.491
RENEE MADE HER WEDDING PLANS.

00:20.491 --> 00:22.293
THAT'S THE CAKE I MADE
FOR A WEDDING A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:22.293 --> 00:25.796
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA SAY. IT'S TOO--
 IT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH.

00:25.796 --> 00:28.629
WELL, I SUPPOSE WE COULD
ADD ANOTHER TIER.
 MAKE IT TWO?

00:28.629 --> 00:31.802
BREE ENDED HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH HER LAWYER.

00:31.802 --> 00:34.165
YOU LIED TO ME.
 TO WIN THIS CASE.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.666
YOU'RE JUST PRETENDING
THERE'S SOMETHING BETWEEN US

00:35.666 --> 00:37.338
SO YOU COULD GET
INFORMATION FROM ME.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.070
I WASN'T TRYING TO--

00:39.070 --> 00:40.671
YOU ARE NOT WELCOME
IN MY HOME.

00:40.671 --> 00:45.376
AND TOM AND LYNETTE
FINALLY GOT BACK TOGETHER.

00:52.223 --> 00:55.526
(Mary Alice)
THIS IS HOW IT STARTED.

00:55.526 --> 00:57.288
THE WOMAN WHO HAD LIVED
ON THE STREET FOR YEARS

00:57.288 --> 01:00.331
CAME OUTSIDE...

01:00.331 --> 01:01.732
AND INTRODUCED HERSELF

01:01.732 --> 01:05.336
TO THE WOMAN WHO WAS
MOVING IN NEXT DOOR.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.538
WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD!

01:07.538 --> 01:09.200
I'M MARTHA HUBER.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.541
MARY ALICE YOUNG.

01:10.541 --> 01:13.704
SO... YOU GOT A HUSBAND?
MINE'S DEAD.

01:13.704 --> 01:15.176
OH, I'M SORRY.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.248
ME, TOO... IN THEORY.

01:17.248 --> 01:19.210
OH. (chuckles)
I HAVE A HUSBAND AND A SON.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.081
THEY'RE IN THE OTHER VAN.
THEY'LL BE HERE SOON.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.714
OOH! I USED TO HAVE A CHAIR
JUST LIKE THAT.

01:23.714 --> 01:25.516
KEPT BREAKING,
SO I THREW IT AWAY.

01:25.516 --> 01:27.618
I HATE CHEAP FURNITURE.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.721
YES, WELL, UH,

01:30.721 --> 01:33.694
I SHOULD GO HELP THE MOVERS.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.297
WAIT! I HARDLY KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU.

01:36.297 --> 01:40.201
YOU DIDN'T EVEN MENTION
WHERE YOU FOLKS ARE FROM.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.572
UP NORTH.

01:41.572 --> 01:44.875
"UP NORTH"? THAT DOESN'T TELL ME
ANYTHING. WHERE EXACTLY?

01:44.875 --> 01:48.279
SMALL TOWN.
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT.

01:48.279 --> 01:50.241
TRY ME.

01:50.241 --> 01:52.583
WHY DO YOU NEED
TO KNOW THAT?

01:52.583 --> 01:54.845
WHY DON'T YOU WANNA
TELL ME?

01:54.845 --> 01:58.589
WELL, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S JUST...

01:58.589 --> 02:00.721
AND JUST LIKE THAT,

02:00.721 --> 02:04.795
MARTHA HUBER FIGURED OUT
I WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

02:04.795 --> 02:07.258
OHH, YOU'RE BUSY.

02:07.258 --> 02:11.162
WE'LL JUST HAVE A LONG CHAT
ONCE YOU'VE SETTLED IN. OKAY?

02:12.833 --> 02:16.567
AND MY NEW NEIGHBOR MADE IT
HER MISSION TO FIND OUT

02:16.567 --> 02:20.171
WHAT MY SECRET WAS.

02:20.171 --> 02:23.844
AND THIS WAS THE BEGINNING...

02:23.844 --> 02:26.277
OF THE END.

02:26.277 --> 02:39.430
♪♪♪

02:39.430 --> 02:50.741
(gunshot)

02:50.741 --> 02:52.903
IT WAS JUST AFTER BREAKFAST

02:52.903 --> 02:55.906
WHEN SUSAN DELFINO
TOLD HER FRIENDS

02:55.906 --> 02:59.350
SHE'D SOON BE MOVING
FROM WISTERIA LANE.

02:59.350 --> 03:00.711
THEY WERE SHOCKED

03:00.711 --> 03:04.315
THEIR OLD FRIEND
WAS ACTUALLY LEAVING--

03:04.315 --> 03:06.857
SO SHOCKED
IT TOOK THEM A MOMENT

03:06.857 --> 03:11.422
TO NOTICE ANOTHER OLD FRIEND
HAD RETURNED.

03:13.264 --> 03:15.266
OH, MY GOD.

03:15.266 --> 03:17.728
HELLO, LADIES.

03:17.728 --> 03:20.601
DID YOU MISS ME?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.873
SO THREE MONTHS
AFTER WE GOT TO PARIS,

03:22.873 --> 03:24.204
ROBIN AND I BROKE UP.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.237
OH, I'M SORRY.

03:26.237 --> 03:28.509
YEAH, A LONG DISTANCE MOVE
CAN BE TOUGH ON A RELATIONSHIP.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.981
THAT, AND I DECIDED I JUST
WASN'T INTO WOMEN ANYMORE.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.883
ALTHOUGH IN PARIS, IT'S HARD
TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

03:32.883 --> 03:35.286
THE WOMEN DON'T SHAVE,
AND THE MEN CARRY PURSES.

03:35.286 --> 03:37.288
(all laugh)

03:37.288 --> 03:39.920
SO... WHAT TEAM
ARE YOU PLAYING FOR NOW?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.552
AH, I'M OUT OF THE GAME.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.254
I DECIDED TO CHANNEL
MY SEXUAL FRUSTRATION

03:43.254 --> 03:44.425
INTO STARTING MY OWN BUSINESS--

03:44.425 --> 03:46.527
A LINE
OF FROZEN FRENCH PASTRIES.

03:46.527 --> 03:49.300
BREE, YOU REMEMBER
HOW MY CROISSANTS

03:49.300 --> 03:50.761
WERE ALWAYS THE BEST
ON THE LANE.

03:50.761 --> 03:52.533
I REMEMBER YOU THINKING THAT.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.704
(chuckles)

03:53.704 --> 03:54.935
SO, BASICALLY,

03:54.935 --> 03:57.308
YOU SELL MICROWAVABLE
FRENCH FOOD... TO THE FRENCH?

03:57.308 --> 03:58.539
YEP.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.011
AS THEY GOT LAZIER AND FATTER,
I GOT THINNER AND RICHER,

04:01.011 --> 04:03.013
NOW MY ACCOUNTANT
HAS ME BUYING CHATEAUS

04:03.013 --> 04:04.715
JUST TO DO SOMETHING
WITH ALL MY MONEY.

04:04.715 --> 04:06.547
(laughs)

04:06.547 --> 04:08.018
(laughs)

04:08.018 --> 04:10.851
SO OTHER THAN WANTING TO RUB
YOUR SUCCESS IN OUR FACES,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.383
WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK?

04:12.383 --> 04:15.255
I HAVE A LITTLE
BUSINESS PROPOSITION...

04:15.255 --> 04:16.757
FOR LYNETTE.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.363
TIGHTER.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.835
(scoffs) IF I GO ANY TIGHTER,
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO BREATHE.

04:24.835 --> 04:27.267
JEAN, YOU'RE TALKING TO A WOMAN
WHO GAVE HERSELF SALMONELLA

04:27.267 --> 04:29.540
TO LOSE 10 POUNDS
BEFORE PROM.

04:29.540 --> 04:32.373
BEAUTY IS SUFFERING.
NOW TIGHTER!

04:32.373 --> 04:35.346
HEY.
 (gasps)

04:35.346 --> 04:37.608
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:37.608 --> 04:40.511
YOU CAN'T SEE ME BEFORE
THE WEDDING. IT'S BAD LUCK.

04:40.511 --> 04:44.385
UH, SO I, UH, PICKED UP
THE PROGRAMS FROM THE PRINTER.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.286
(gasps)

04:49.289 --> 04:51.362
OH, MY GOD.

04:51.362 --> 04:53.324
DO I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING?

04:53.324 --> 04:55.065
THIS IS IVORY.
I TOLD YOU TO GET BEIGE.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.767
ARE YOU COLOR-BLIND?

04:56.767 --> 04:58.699
YOU DO KNOW I'M BLACK, RIGHT?

05:00.471 --> 05:02.002
HONEY, I-I CAN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE, UH,

05:02.002 --> 05:03.374
YOU SEEM A LITTLE...

05:03.374 --> 05:04.304
BITCHY?

05:04.304 --> 05:07.508
NO, I WAS GONNA SAY, UH,
LESS ANGELIC THAN USUAL.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.481
I AM BUSTING MY ASS TO PLAN
THE HAPPIEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE.

05:10.481 --> 05:13.484
SO LET'S DITCH THE SARCASM,
SHALL WE?

05:13.484 --> 05:14.985
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT IS BAD LUCK

05:14.985 --> 05:17.087
FOR THE GROOM TO SEE THE BRIDE
BEFORE THE WEDDING,

05:17.087 --> 05:18.689
AND I JUST REALIZED WHY.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.092
(door closes)

05:22.092 --> 05:25.596
JEAN, I TOLD YOU TIGHTER.
I DON'T CARE IF I CAN BREATHE.

05:25.596 --> 05:28.328
(under breath) AT THIS POINT,
NEITHER DO I.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.663
WHAT WAS GOING ON
OUT THERE?

05:32.663 --> 05:34.435
KATHERINE CAME BACK
FOR A VISIT.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.607
AND BEFORE YOU GET TOO EXCITED,
NO, SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN ANYMORE.

05:36.607 --> 05:38.739
REALLY? DAMN.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.941
HEY, WHILE YOU WERE OUT DISHING
WITH YOUR FRIENDS,

05:40.941 --> 05:42.413
OUR GARDENER QUIT.

05:42.413 --> 05:43.544
HE WOULDN'T NAME NAMES,

05:43.544 --> 05:46.417
BUT APPARENTLY ONE OF US IS
A LITTLE TOO HARD TO PLEASE.

05:46.417 --> 05:47.878
(crunches) YEAH,
YOU SHOULD WORK ON THAT.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.520
SO YOU GONNA GET A NEW ONE?

05:49.520 --> 05:50.681
WHEN?
 (crunches)

05:50.681 --> 05:52.352
I HAVE A JOB, TOO, YOU KNOW.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.354
CARLOS, YOU HELP THE POOR
AND DOWNTRODDEN--

05:54.354 --> 05:55.756
A GROUP WITH
A VERY FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.988
(cell phone rings)
 I'M WORKING CRAZY HOURS.

05:57.988 --> 06:00.461
HOUSE STUFF
IS UP TO YOU NOW.
 (ring)

06:00.461 --> 06:02.433
MM! IT'S MY BOSS.
 (ring and beep)

06:02.433 --> 06:04.895
HELLO, MR. HOFFMAN.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.440
REALLY? ME?

06:09.440 --> 06:12.002
Y-YES, I'M VERY INTERESTED.

06:12.002 --> 06:13.373
THANK YOU.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.507
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

06:16.507 --> 06:18.549
OKAY,
I'LL SEE YOU THEN, SIR.

06:18.549 --> 06:19.810
(beep)

06:19.810 --> 06:21.051
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

06:21.051 --> 06:24.415
I JUST GOT
A HUGE PROMOTION.

06:24.415 --> 06:26.487
I'M THE NEW HEAD
OF V.I.P. SALES.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.459
SERIOUSLY?

06:28.459 --> 06:29.389
BABE, THAT'S AMAZING.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.821
MM.

06:30.821 --> 06:33.093
WHAT'S... WRONG?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.465
I DON'T KNOW.

06:34.465 --> 06:37.598
IT'S SO BIG.
IT'S A WHOLE DEPARTMENT.

06:37.598 --> 06:40.901
THEY'RE REALLY TRUSTING ME.
WHAT IF I CAN'T DO IT?

06:40.901 --> 06:45.736
GABY, DON'T YOU KNOW
HOW SMART AND TALENTED YOU ARE?

06:45.736 --> 06:46.907
YOU DESERVE THIS.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.111
(sighs) YEAH.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.583
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
 (chuckles)

06:52.583 --> 06:55.085
I JUST GOTTA LEARN
HOW TO BE THE BOSS. (chuckles)

06:55.085 --> 06:56.817
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO TALK TO EMPLOYEES.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.489
YEAH, I THINK OUR GARDENER
WOULD AGREE.

06:58.489 --> 07:02.052
OH, PLEASE. (chuckles)
THAT SAD SACK WAS A MORON.

07:03.594 --> 07:05.596
SO HOW YOU BEEN FEELING?

07:05.596 --> 07:07.458
I'VE BEEN CRAVING CHOCOLATE
CONSTANTLY.

07:07.458 --> 07:10.060
BUT THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

07:10.060 --> 07:12.202
WITHIN MODERATION,
BUT I'M NOT WORRIED.

07:12.202 --> 07:13.764
YOU LOOK GREAT.

07:13.764 --> 07:16.537
MM, THANK YOU.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.510
YOU KNOW,
JULIE IS GETTING HER PhD,

07:19.510 --> 07:21.612
SO SOON SHE'LL BE A DOCTOR, TOO.

07:21.612 --> 07:25.846
MAYBE YOU TWO SHOULD HAVE LUNCH
SOMETIME AND TALK SHOP.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.618
(pager beeps)

07:27.618 --> 07:29.049
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE NICE.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.822
UH, I'M SORRY. I HAVE TO TAKE
THIS. UH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:31.822 --> 07:33.083
(door opens)

07:33.083 --> 07:35.125
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

07:35.125 --> 07:36.487
(door closes)
 HE WAS FLIRTING WITH YOU.

07:36.487 --> 07:37.488
HE IS MY OBSTETRICIAN.

07:37.488 --> 07:40.030
WELL, HE KNOWS YOU'RE FERTILE.
MEN LIKE THAT.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.533
ENOUGH. I DON'T NEED YOU
TO FIX ME UP.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.636
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE LONELY.

07:45.636 --> 07:46.767
WELL, GOOD NEWS.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.869
IN THREE WEEKS, I WILL HAVE
A PERMANENT HOUSEGUEST.

07:48.869 --> 07:52.102
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE OTHER KIND OF LONELY.

07:52.102 --> 07:55.075
EVEN SINGLE MOTHERS
HAVE NEEDS.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.248
CHILDBIRTH CAN'T POSSIBLY BE
AS PAINFUL AS THIS CONVERSATION.

07:58.248 --> 07:59.950
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.613
HAVING A KID IS EXHAUSTING.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.786
YOU HAVE NO TIME TO EXERCISE
OR EAT RIGHT.

08:05.786 --> 08:09.820
THE GREAT NEWS IS, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LET YOURSELF GO.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.222
I'LL BE THERE,
HELPING WITH THE BABY.

08:12.222 --> 08:14.164
SO YOU'LL HAVE TIME
TO GO TO THE GYM.

08:14.164 --> 08:16.727
I'LL LET MYSELF GO.
I DON'T MIND.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.899
MOM,
I JUST FELT THE BABY

08:18.899 --> 08:21.632
TAP OUT "MAKE HER STOP"
IN MORSE CODE.

08:21.632 --> 08:25.135
IT'S HARD TO FIND A MAN
WHEN YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM.

08:25.135 --> 08:27.107
THAT'S MY POINT. I'M DONE.

08:30.581 --> 08:32.883
AS I REMEMBER,
YOU FOUND MIKE.

08:32.883 --> 08:35.816
YES. WELL...

08:35.816 --> 08:39.519
I WAS VERY LUCKY.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.652
YOU SURE WERE.

08:41.652 --> 08:43.894
(sighs)

08:43.894 --> 08:46.857
THERE YOU GO.
 (groans)

08:46.857 --> 08:49.600
OH, BEAUTIFUL DAY,
ISN'T IT?

08:49.600 --> 08:50.861
ONE OF THE NICE THINGS
ABOUT DYING IS

08:50.861 --> 08:52.963
EVERY DAY SEEMS BEAUTIFUL.

08:54.565 --> 08:56.306
YOU ALWAYS WINCE
WHEN I SAY THINGS LIKE THAT.

08:56.306 --> 08:59.940
I DON'T MEAN TO.
ITS JUST... HARD FOR ME.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.073
FOR YOU? HEY, YOU WANNA
SWITCH PLACES WITH HER?

09:03.073 --> 09:04.745
BE NICE, ROY.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.147
BY THE WAY, KAREN,
I GOT THAT SONG YOU WANTED

09:07.147 --> 09:09.149
FOR YOUR... FUNERAL.

09:09.149 --> 09:10.721
OH, THANK YOU, BREE.

09:10.721 --> 09:12.583
JOHNNY MATHIS.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.655
MY GIRLFRIENDS AND I
TAUGHT EACH OTHER TO DANCE

09:14.655 --> 09:16.186
LISTENING TO
"WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!"

09:16.186 --> 09:19.830
AW. OH, I WAS ONLY ABLE
TO GET IT ON A CD.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.191
NO, NO.

09:21.191 --> 09:23.664
IT'S GOTTA BE ON A 45 THAT I CAN
PLAY ON A RECORD PLAYER,

09:23.664 --> 09:25.666
JUST LIKE I DID
WHEN I WAS A KID.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.800
BY THE WAY, I'LL ALSO NEED
THE RECORD PLAYER.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.303
YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY HARD
TO FIND THOSE 45s.

09:34.705 --> 09:35.646
BUT I'M GONNA KEEP LOOKING.

09:35.646 --> 09:36.947
(cell phone rings)

09:36.947 --> 09:38.578
(beep)

09:38.578 --> 09:41.211
HELLO?

09:41.211 --> 09:43.583
OH. HELLO, TRIP.

09:45.315 --> 09:47.958
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.792
PLEASE, STOP CALLING.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.963
(beep)

09:52.963 --> 09:54.965
IS THAT YOUR LAWYER FRIEND?

09:54.965 --> 09:56.797
WELL, YOU'RE HALF RIGHT.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.729
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED HIM.

09:58.729 --> 10:02.132
I DID, MORE THAN I'VE LIKED
ANYBODY IN A VERY LONG TIME.

10:02.132 --> 10:05.075
BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT
HE JUST MANIPULATES PEOPLE

10:05.075 --> 10:07.007
SO THAT HE CAN GET
WHAT HE WANTS.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.140
CAN'T TRUST HIM.

10:10.140 --> 10:13.644
ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO,
I WILL CHECK IN ON YOU LATER.

10:15.886 --> 10:19.990
ROY, BE A PEACH AND LOOK UP
A PHONE NUMBER FOR ME.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.753
KAREN, WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

10:22.753 --> 10:23.994
I DON'T KNOW.

10:23.994 --> 10:25.726
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN
TO SCREW WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES

10:25.726 --> 10:28.628
ONE LAST TIME
BEFORE I CHECK OUT.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.030
(chuckles)

10:30.030 --> 10:32.032
(laughs)

10:32.032 --> 10:35.305
WOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU ARE DOING PRETTY GOOD.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.137
I MEAN, YOUR OWN COMPANY?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.309
YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT TO BRAG
IN FRONT OF THE GIRLS,

10:39.309 --> 10:41.411
BUT IT'S WORTH A FEW BUCKS.

10:41.411 --> 10:42.943
THAT WAS YOU NOT BRAGGING?

10:42.943 --> 10:45.976
WELL, JUST LOOK AT OUR LAST
FINANCIAL STATEMENT.

10:48.979 --> 10:51.722
(gasps)
 HA! I LOVE DOING THAT!

10:51.722 --> 10:53.784
OH! (laughs) HAVE A SEAT.

10:53.784 --> 10:57.828
IN FACT, WE ARE DOING SO WELL

10:57.828 --> 11:00.390
THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO EXPAND
WORLDWIDE,

11:00.390 --> 11:03.764
AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HEAD
OUR U.S. DIVISION

11:03.764 --> 11:05.095
IN NEW YORK.

11:07.768 --> 11:10.340
OH, MY GOD.

11:10.340 --> 11:13.744
THAT'S A HUGE JOB.

11:13.744 --> 11:15.445
WHY ME?

11:15.445 --> 11:17.778
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE SMARTEST
BUSINESSWOMAN I KNOW.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.409
AND WHEN I HEARD
THAT YOU AND TOM SPLIT,

11:19.409 --> 11:21.882
I THOUGHT, THERE'S NOTHING
TYING YOU TO FAIRVIEW.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.053
WELL, HERE'S THE THING--

11:23.053 --> 11:24.715
20 MINUTES
UNTIL MY JOB INTERVIEW,

11:24.715 --> 11:27.087
AND I LOSE A BUTTON. CAN YOU--
KATHERINE?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.819
THAT'S THE THING.

11:28.819 --> 11:31.191
WHAT BRINGS YOU BACK
TO THE STATES?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.763
YOUR WIFE, ACTUALLY.

11:32.763 --> 11:35.996
I CAME TO OFFER HER A JOB
IN NEW YORK.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.799
WOW.

11:38.799 --> 11:41.171
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
I'M NOT TAKING IT.

11:41.171 --> 11:43.003
(chuckles)
 (chuckles)

11:43.003 --> 11:46.977
WE JUST GOT BACK TOGETHER,
AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

11:46.977 --> 11:48.879
MMM. SORRY, KATHERINE.

11:48.879 --> 11:50.841
I KNOW HOW PAINFUL IT IS
TO LOSE LYNETTE,

11:50.841 --> 11:52.813
AND HOW SWEET IT IS
TO GET HER BACK.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.144
(chuckles)

11:54.144 --> 11:56.216
HERE, LEAVE THE SHIRT WITH ME,
BABE. I GOT IT.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.718
THANKS.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.719
WELL...

11:59.719 --> 12:01.421
I'M IN TOWN FOR THREE DAYS

12:01.421 --> 12:03.223
IF YOU WANNA
KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.426
NO. I FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE
WITH MY DECISION.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.359
OKAY, BUT THE LYNETTE
THAT I KNEW

12:09.359 --> 12:13.904
WAS NEVER HAPPY WITH A LIFE
OF... SEWING BUTTONS.

12:22.312 --> 12:23.313
(door closes)

12:23.313 --> 12:24.474
HEY, HEY! SORRY I'M LATE.

12:24.474 --> 12:26.346
I'M STARVING!
WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.919
I HAD A LOVELY STEAK.

12:28.919 --> 12:30.821
THEN AN HOUR LATER,
I HAD YOUR LOVELY STEAK.

12:30.821 --> 12:34.024
SO I GUESS YOU'RE HAVING...
CEREAL.

12:34.024 --> 12:35.155
OH, COME ON.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.357
FIRST DAY OF A NEW JOB--
IT WAS CRAZY.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.229
AND WHAT? (sighs)
YOU LOST YOUR PHONE?

12:39.229 --> 12:42.833
(sighs) I KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M A TERRIBLE, AWFUL PERSON.

12:42.833 --> 12:47.297
BUT MAYBE YOU CAN
FIND A WAY TO FORGIVE ME

12:47.297 --> 12:50.240
AFTER YOU SEE THIS.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.803
WHOA.
 (laughs)

12:52.803 --> 12:54.274
I KNOW. I SAW IT,
AND ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT

12:54.274 --> 12:58.248
WAS HOW SEXY IT WOULD LOOK ON
THAT BIG, STRONG WRIST OF YOURS.

12:58.248 --> 13:00.010
(both chuckle)

13:00.010 --> 13:02.182
WELL, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN ANYTH--

13:03.814 --> 13:06.256
OH, MY GOD. WAIT A MINUTE.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.288
WHAT?

13:08.288 --> 13:11.791
I KNOW THIS MOVE.
I INVENTED THIS MOVE.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.464
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

13:14.464 --> 13:16.296
IT'S WHAT
I USED TO DO TO YOU.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.467
I'D BUY YOU JEWELRY

13:17.467 --> 13:20.300
TO COMPENSATE
FOR BEING A LOUSY HUSBAND.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.903
AND IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY,
SO SHUT UP AND ENJOY IT.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.435
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE TRYING
TO BUY ME OFF WITH A WATCH.

13:25.435 --> 13:26.937
(gasps) OOH! WHEN YOU SHAKE
YOUR WRIST LIKE THAT,

13:26.937 --> 13:28.808
THE DIAMONDS REALLY CATCH
THE LIGHT.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.540
OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE EVEN QUOTING ME!

13:30.540 --> 13:33.213
(scoffs) YOU DON'T WANT
THE WATCH? FINE.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.185
BUT EVERYONE HAS A PRICE.
YOU NAME IT.

13:35.185 --> 13:38.218
SEX? MASSAGE?
THREE STOOGES MARATHON?

13:38.218 --> 13:41.491
THE PRICE OF MY FORGIVENESS

13:41.491 --> 13:44.224
IS YOU PAYING
A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION TO ME,

13:44.224 --> 13:45.395
BEING MORE PRESENT,

13:45.395 --> 13:47.527
MORE RESPECTFUL
OF MY FEELINGS AND NEEDS.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.930
YOU WANT A NEW CAR.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.231
I'M GOING TO BED.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.234
WHAT? NO, COME BACK!
YOU'RE SEXY WHEN YOU'RE ANGRY.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.366
YEP! THAT'S MINE, TOO!

14:01.011 --> 14:03.313
LYNETTE SCAVO?

14:03.313 --> 14:06.076
OH, MY GOD!

14:06.076 --> 14:07.117
HOW LONG AS IT BEEN?

14:07.117 --> 14:09.119
OH! A LONG TIME.

14:09.119 --> 14:10.850
HOW ARE YOU DOING, NATALIE?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.282
I'M GREAT.

14:12.282 --> 14:15.855
THE QUESTION IS, HOW ARE YOU?
I HEARD ABOUT YOU AND TOM.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.428
OH. YEAH, WE WENT THROUGH
A ROUGH PATCH,

14:18.428 --> 14:21.361
BUT WE'RE BACK TOGETHER NOW,
AND THINGS ARE BETTER THAN EVER.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.392
(chuckles)

14:22.392 --> 14:26.196
WHAT A RELIEF. I JUST KEPT
THINKING, "POOR LYNETTE--

14:26.196 --> 14:28.068
"SACRIFICED HER WHOLE CAREER
FOR THAT MAN,

14:28.068 --> 14:30.000
AND THEN
IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK OUT?"

14:30.000 --> 14:33.173
OH, JUST TO BE CLEAR, I DIDN'T
SACRIFICE MY CAREER FOR ANYONE.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.005
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING
BY IT.

14:35.005 --> 14:36.876
IF ANYTHING,
I'M JEALOUS OF YOU.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.208
OH?

14:38.208 --> 14:41.381
MY COMPANY HAS BRANCHES
IN 15 CITIES AROUND THE WORLD.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.353
I LIVE OUT OF A SUITCASE.
AND YOU?

14:43.353 --> 14:46.416
THERE MUST BE DAYS WHEN
YOU DON'T EVEN LEAVE THE HOUSE.

14:46.416 --> 14:48.989
OH, THE SIMPLE LIFE.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.163
I GOT A JOB OFFER YESTERDAY.

14:53.163 --> 14:54.324
REALLY?

14:54.324 --> 14:56.096
YEAH, THIS BIG
EUROPEAN FOOD COMPANY IS

14:56.096 --> 14:59.369
TAKING ITS BRAND TO THE STATES,
AND THEY WANT ME TO RUN IT.

14:59.369 --> 15:00.400
SO...

15:00.400 --> 15:02.973
IMPRESSIVE.
WHEN DO YOU START?

15:02.973 --> 15:07.077
WELL, IT'S IN NEW YORK, SO IT'S
A LOT TO CONSIDER, AND...

15:07.077 --> 15:09.439
AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND YOU.

15:09.439 --> 15:12.442
I'D GRAB AN OPPORTUNITY
LIKE THAT IN A SECOND,

15:12.442 --> 15:14.484
BUT NOT YOU.

15:14.484 --> 15:15.615
(chuckles)

15:15.615 --> 15:18.388
IN YOUR HEART OF HEARTS,
YOU'RE A WIFE AND A MOMMY.

15:18.388 --> 15:20.150
CONGRATS.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.992
SEE YA.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.495
(dials)

15:29.159 --> 15:30.930
KATHERINE, IT'S LYNETTE.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.433
CALL ME BACK. WE HAVE TO TALK.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.635
(beep)

15:35.635 --> 15:38.538
HEY, GOTTA RUN. HUGE DAY.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.470
THE E-MAILS HAVE BEEN
COMING IN SINCE 7:00.

15:40.470 --> 15:42.512
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
OUR NEW GARDENER STARTED TODAY.

15:42.512 --> 15:43.673
GREAT. MIND RUNNING DEFENSE
FOR ME?

15:43.673 --> 15:45.445
I REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME
TO CHITCHAT WITH THE HELP.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.417
IT'LL BE MY PLEASURE.

15:51.982 --> 15:54.354
OH. HOLA.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.725
I'M CARMEN.

15:55.725 --> 15:58.728
UH-HUH.

15:58.728 --> 16:01.461
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.163
THAT'S OUR NEW GARDENER.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.095
SHE'S GONNA TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING AROUND HERE

16:05.095 --> 16:06.396
THAT'S BEEN NEGLECTED.

16:06.396 --> 16:09.199
OH, YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

16:09.199 --> 16:11.371
JUST MAKING A POINT.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.044
YOU CROSSED A LINE,
CARLOS.

16:14.044 --> 16:15.605
YOU CROSSED A LINE!

16:15.605 --> 16:18.648
GABY, COME ON!

16:18.648 --> 16:20.180
(car door closes, engine starts)

16:20.180 --> 16:22.512
GABY!
 (tires peal)

16:42.732 --> 16:46.506
(sighs) WATCH THE DIRT.
AND WATCH THE GRASS.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.007
FOCUS, LADIES!

16:48.007 --> 16:50.780
THIS DRESS COSTS MORE THAN
YOUR HOUSES PUT TOGETHER!

16:50.780 --> 16:52.282
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
RENEE?

16:52.282 --> 16:53.443
I KNOW THIS IS YOUR DAY,
BUT IT'S ONLY 10:00,

16:53.443 --> 16:54.714
AND YOU'RE ALREADY
A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.316
WELL, THEN I'M RUNNING LATE.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.088
I SHOULD'VE BEEN A HUGE PAIN
IN THE ASS BY 9:00.

16:58.088 --> 17:00.190
YOU IN THE STUPID HAT,

17:00.190 --> 17:01.651
OPEN THE DOOR!

17:07.457 --> 17:09.299
(chuckles) OH, WOW!

17:09.299 --> 17:11.401
WHERE ARE YOU GOING
ALL DOLLED UP?

17:11.401 --> 17:15.565
RENEE'S WEDDING. I JUST WANTED
TO CHECK ON KAREN BEFORE I LEFT.

17:15.565 --> 17:17.036
SHE'S SLEEPING.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.539
I DON'T THINK
IT'LL BE LONG NOW.

17:21.611 --> 17:25.675
OH, ROY.
I AM... SO SORRY.

17:25.675 --> 17:27.416
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO STAY?

17:27.416 --> 17:28.578
NO.

17:28.578 --> 17:31.081
THIS IS OUR TIME TOGETHER.

17:31.081 --> 17:32.552
WE'LL BE FINE.

17:34.224 --> 17:36.386
OH, GOOD!
YOU FOUND KAREN'S RECORD.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.588
NOT ME. THAT LAWYER GUY.

17:38.588 --> 17:40.230
TRIP?

17:40.230 --> 17:42.632
KAREN TOLD HIM
SHE REALLY WANTED IT.

17:42.632 --> 17:47.197
THE SON OF A GUN MUST'VE GONE
TO 20 DIFFERENT RECORD STORES.

17:47.197 --> 17:50.240
(sighs)
WELL, THAT'S LOVELY.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.173
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN THE SMILE ON
HER FACE WHEN HE BROUGHT IT IN.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.704
MM.

17:54.704 --> 17:57.707
HE'S... A GOOD GUY.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.152
(inhales sharply)

18:02.152 --> 18:05.585
DO YOU SERIOUSLY NEED
TO STRETCH OUT ON HER?

18:05.585 --> 18:07.387
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
CREASE?

18:07.387 --> 18:09.389
(cell phone rings and beeps)

18:09.389 --> 18:12.622
(scoffs) HELLO, BEN.

18:12.622 --> 18:16.196
HEY, HEY, HEY.
DON'T RAISE YOUR VOICE TO ME.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.527
WELL, HAIR AND MAKEUP
TOOK FOREVER,

18:17.527 --> 18:20.570
AND THEN WE HAD TO WAIT
20 MINUTES FOR SUSAN, AND--

18:20.570 --> 18:22.272
I WAS TOTALLY ON TIME.

18:22.272 --> 18:24.574
(lowered voice) HE DOES NOT
NEED TO KNOW THAT.

18:24.574 --> 18:26.276
(normal voice)
YEAH, WE'RE ON OUR WAY NOW.

18:26.276 --> 18:28.538
I PROMISE WE'LL BE THERE
NO LATER THAN...

18:28.538 --> 18:30.740
OH! WE'RE GOING THROUGH
A TUNNEL!
 (beep)

18:30.740 --> 18:32.512
HOW LATE ARE WE?

18:32.512 --> 18:34.584
I SHOULD'VE BEEN
CUTTING THE CAKE BY NOW!

18:34.584 --> 18:37.587
OKAY, NOT A GOOD DAY
TO HAND HER A KNIFE.

18:37.587 --> 18:39.489
MM.

18:39.489 --> 18:41.351
(exhales deeply)

18:41.351 --> 18:42.792
JULIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

18:42.792 --> 18:45.655
OH, MY GOD.
 WHAT? WHAT'S WRONG?

18:45.655 --> 18:48.658
(exhales sharply)
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.

18:48.658 --> 18:50.129
(all gasp)

18:50.129 --> 18:52.602
(women scream)

18:52.602 --> 18:53.833
(groans)
 OH! AH!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.565
AAH! HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO ME?!

18:55.565 --> 18:57.267
SHE'S IN LABOR!

18:57.267 --> 18:58.668
OH! NINE MONTHS!

18:58.668 --> 19:01.741
YOU HAD NINE MONTHS, AND THIS IS
THE MOMENT YOU PICK?!

19:01.741 --> 19:03.873
RENEE, I AM SO SORRY. AAH! AAH!

19:03.873 --> 19:05.745
HOLD ON.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.447
HOW?! MY DRESS IS RUINED!

19:07.447 --> 19:09.349
(Julie and Susan
breathing deeply)
 WAIT, I GOT AN IDEA.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.422
HEY, DRIVER, WE NEED YOU
TO SWING BY CUMBERLY'S.

19:12.422 --> 19:15.225
MY STORE HAS
AN AMAZING BRIDAL DEPARTMENT.

19:15.225 --> 19:17.156
ARE YOU INSANE?!
TAKE US TO THE HOSPITAL!

19:17.156 --> 19:19.529
OH, COME ON.
SHE JUST STARTED LABOR.
 (groans)

19:19.529 --> 19:21.591
KEEP YOUR LEGS TOGETHER,
HONEY.

19:21.591 --> 19:23.663
LOOK, WE'RE JUST GONNA RUN IN
AND GRAB A DRESS.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.764
(scoffs) AND SHOES.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.536
YOU NEED SHOES, TOO?

19:26.536 --> 19:28.398
THANKS
TO OLD FAITHFUL HERE.

19:28.398 --> 19:29.839
MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING A BABY,

19:29.839 --> 19:31.541
AND YOU WANNA GO
ON A SHOPPING SPREE?!

19:31.541 --> 19:34.544
UH, COULD SOMEONE PLEASE
JUST TELL ME WHERE TO GO?

19:34.544 --> 19:36.306
CUMBERLY'S!
 HOSPITAL!

19:36.306 --> 19:38.908
(breathing deeply)
LET'S JUST GO TO CUMBERLY'S.

19:38.908 --> 19:40.850
JULIE!
 MOM, MY CONTRACTIONS
JUST STARTED.

19:40.850 --> 19:42.482
WE HAVE TIME. AAH!

19:42.482 --> 19:44.554
OHH! DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP
DOING THAT?

19:47.487 --> 19:49.719
(brakes screech)

19:49.719 --> 19:52.562
OKAY,
SIZE 6s ARE OVER THERE.

19:52.562 --> 19:55.225
HEY!
 OH, DON'T LIE TO ME!

19:57.567 --> 19:59.899
(scoffs) NO.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.271
NO.

20:01.271 --> 20:02.932
GOD, NO.

20:02.932 --> 20:06.636
(gasps)

20:06.636 --> 20:07.907
NOW THAT IS BEAUTIFUL.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.939
MY DAUGHTER'S LOOKING AT THIS.

20:09.939 --> 20:11.911
WHEN'S HER WEDDING?
 THREE MONTHS.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.943
MINE'S IN FIVE MINUTES.

20:13.943 --> 20:15.245
UNZIP ME.

20:16.786 --> 20:18.588
(zip)

20:18.588 --> 20:20.650
OH! HI. HI. (chuckles)

20:20.650 --> 20:21.991
I'M, UH, GABRIELLE SOLIS,

20:21.991 --> 20:24.354
HEAD OF V.I.P. SALES
HERE AT CUMBERLY'S.

20:24.354 --> 20:26.896
I'M KENT, MINIMUM WAGE WORKER
STUCK HERE ON A SATURDAY.

20:26.896 --> 20:28.498
CAN I HELP YOU?

20:28.498 --> 20:30.760
UH, I NEED TO BORROW
A BRIDAL GOWN.

20:30.760 --> 20:32.802
BORROW?
 JUST FOR THE AFTERNOON.

20:32.802 --> 20:34.934
WE DON'T LEND BRIDAL DRESSES.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.407
WELL... (chuckles)
I KNOW IT'S NOT POLICY,

20:37.407 --> 20:39.609
BUT CAN'T YOU DO A FAVOR
FOR A FELLOW WORKER?

20:39.609 --> 20:41.841
MA'AM,
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.514
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR EMPLOYEE I.D. CARD?

20:44.514 --> 20:45.845
NO. I'M NOT
ONE OF THOSE NERDS

20:45.845 --> 20:49.549
WHO CARRIES HER I.D. CARD
ON A...

20:49.549 --> 20:51.681
HANDSOME LANYARD. (chuckles)

20:51.681 --> 20:55.355
SO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
A $6,000 WEDDING DRESS?

20:55.355 --> 20:57.787
$5,000 WITH
MY EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT. (chuckles)

20:57.787 --> 20:59.289
GO AWAY, MA'AM.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.693
OW!
 OHH! OH, THAT WAS A BIG ONE!

21:03.693 --> 21:05.735
OH! THEY SEEM TO BE COMING
A LOT FASTER.

21:05.735 --> 21:06.936
OH. (sighs)

21:06.936 --> 21:09.939
EXCUSE ME,
WOULD YOU MIND GOING IN

21:09.939 --> 21:11.801
AND FINDING OUT
WHAT'S KEEPING THEM?

21:11.801 --> 21:14.304
THINGS SEEM TO BE
SPEEDING UP A BIT BACK HERE.

21:14.304 --> 21:15.475
RIGHT AWAY.

21:17.407 --> 21:19.379
(exhales sharply)
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:19.379 --> 21:20.550
YOU ARE NOT HAVING
MY GRANDDAUGHTER

21:20.550 --> 21:21.951
IN THE BACK OF A LIMOUSINE!

21:21.951 --> 21:23.313
(grunts)

21:25.355 --> 21:26.416
OOH!

21:26.416 --> 21:27.717
(exhales deeply) KEEP BREATHING!

21:27.717 --> 21:29.589
(starts engine)

21:29.589 --> 21:30.890
(tires peal)

21:33.763 --> 21:34.864
(speaking inaudibly)

21:36.065 --> 21:38.328
OH.
 AHH. SO WE SET?

21:38.328 --> 21:39.869
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TOLD YOU I WAS
A BIG SHOT HERE.
 (chuckles)

21:39.869 --> 21:41.300
NOW WALK WITH ME.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.972
UM, THERE'S ONLY ONE
TINY HICCUP.

21:42.972 --> 21:44.504
(Kent) HEY, WHERE YOU GOING
WITH THAT DRESS?!

21:44.504 --> 21:46.336
AND NOW WE RUN.
 (gasps)

21:51.741 --> 21:54.614
(both panting)

21:54.614 --> 21:56.646
WHERE--WHERE'S THE LIMO?

21:56.646 --> 21:58.518
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS RIGHT HERE.
 (alarm blaring)

21:58.518 --> 21:59.689
AND WE'RE RUNNING AGAIN!

21:59.689 --> 22:01.951
AAH!

22:06.726 --> 22:09.429
(both panting)

22:11.401 --> 22:14.564
DO YOU... NOT HAVE A CAR?

22:14.564 --> 22:17.106
DOES IT LOOK LIKE
WE HAVE A CAR, HUH?

22:17.106 --> 22:18.938
DOES IT?!
 AAH!

22:18.938 --> 22:21.371
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, AGAIN,
LATE FOR YOUR OWN WEDDING.

22:21.371 --> 22:22.672
(grunts)
 MAYBE KILL THIS GUY LATER.

22:22.672 --> 22:24.914
(breathing heavily)

22:26.846 --> 22:29.348
DON'T SAY A WORD.
YOU HEAR ME?!

22:29.348 --> 22:32.622
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I HAD
TO GO THROUGH TO GET HERE,

22:32.622 --> 22:36.786
SO IF YOU EVEN GIVE ME
 ONE SYLLABLE OF GRIEF,

22:36.786 --> 22:40.930
I WILL KICK YOUR SORRY ASS
ALL THE WAY BACK TO AUSTRALIA!

22:40.930 --> 22:43.933
(breathing heavily)

22:45.395 --> 22:48.097
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.543
(sobbing)

22:55.044 --> 22:56.606
(Renee laughs)

22:56.606 --> 22:58.077
(chuckles)

22:58.077 --> 23:00.980
LET'S GO INSIDE AND GET STARTED
ON OUR WEDDED BLISS, EH?

23:05.515 --> 23:07.557
(jazz playing,
indistinct conversations)

23:07.557 --> 23:09.659
NO, NO, KATHERINE,
I AM EXCITED.

23:09.659 --> 23:12.061
I JUST NEED
TO TALK TO TOM FIRST.

23:12.061 --> 23:15.595
WELL, CAN YOU GIVE ME
TILL THE END OF THE DAY?

23:15.595 --> 23:17.066
OKAY, THANKS. BYE.

23:17.066 --> 23:18.428
TALK TO ME ABOUT WHAT?
(chuckles)

23:18.428 --> 23:20.600
HI!
 HI. MMM.

23:20.600 --> 23:24.634
OH, UM, KATHERINE KEEPS
PUSHING ME ABOUT THIS JOB THING.

23:24.634 --> 23:25.835
I THOUGHT YOU TOLD HER "NO."

23:25.835 --> 23:27.537
I DID,

23:27.537 --> 23:30.179
BUT ONCE SHE STARTED TALKING
ABOUT COMPENSATION PACKAGES

23:30.179 --> 23:33.182
AND... (chuckles)

23:33.182 --> 23:35.044
YOU'RE NEGOTIATING A SALARY?

23:35.044 --> 23:37.647
LYNETTE, WE... (sighs)

23:37.647 --> 23:40.490
WE JUST GOT BACK TOGETHER.
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

23:40.490 --> 23:42.051
IT COULD BE THE LAST TIME

23:42.051 --> 23:45.054
AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS
COMES ALONG FOR ME.

23:45.054 --> 23:48.197
IF I DON'T TAKE IT,
I'M--I'M AFRAID THAT...

23:48.197 --> 23:50.059
YOU WON'T BE HAPPY.

23:50.059 --> 23:52.932
WELL...

23:52.932 --> 23:54.103
YEAH.

23:58.808 --> 23:59.969
HEY.

23:59.969 --> 24:01.671
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

24:01.671 --> 24:03.873
LYNETTE...

24:03.873 --> 24:05.144
I WOULD DO ANYTHING,

24:05.144 --> 24:08.217
I WOULD GO ANYWHERE
IN THE WORLD

24:08.217 --> 24:12.522
IF I BELIEVED IT WOULD
FINALLY MAKE YOU HAPPY.

24:12.522 --> 24:13.983
BUT FOR AS LONG
AS I HAVE KNOWN YOU,

24:13.983 --> 24:15.224
YOU'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT

24:15.224 --> 24:19.559
YOU NEEDED SOMETHING ELSE
TO MAKE YOU COMPLETE.

24:19.559 --> 24:23.032
AND I'M STARTING TO REALIZE

24:23.032 --> 24:25.765
NOTHING EVER WILL.

24:34.704 --> 24:37.707
(indistinct conversations
and laughter)

24:37.707 --> 24:42.652
(piano playing light jazz)

24:50.119 --> 24:52.762
HELLO, TRIP.

24:52.762 --> 24:53.923
BEN INVITED ME,

24:53.923 --> 24:56.926
SO IF YOU WANNA SLUG SOMEBODY,
SLUG HIM.

24:56.926 --> 24:59.899
(chuckles) NO.
I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU.

25:01.170 --> 25:05.234
I WANTED TO, UH, THANK YOU FOR
WHAT YOU DID FOR MRS. McCLUSKEY.

25:05.234 --> 25:07.607
THAT WAS VERY KIND.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.609
SHE'S AN AWESOME LADY,

25:09.609 --> 25:13.212
AND SHE ONCE HELPED OUT
A CLIENT OF MINE.

25:14.684 --> 25:16.786
WELL, THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO SAY.

25:16.786 --> 25:18.117
ENJOY THE RECEPTION.

25:18.117 --> 25:21.050
REALLY, YOU CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY TO ME?

25:22.291 --> 25:23.653
LIKE WHAT?

25:23.653 --> 25:26.525
I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, UM...

25:26.525 --> 25:29.528
HOW ABOUT, "HEY, TRIP,
MAYBE YOU ARE A GOOD GUY.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.200
I SHOULD GIVE YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE"?

25:31.200 --> 25:35.104
IS THAT WHY YOU FOUND
THAT OLD RECORD? (chuckles)

25:35.104 --> 25:36.666
TO IMPRESS ME?

25:36.666 --> 25:39.769
DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT?

25:41.911 --> 25:44.073
LOOK...

25:45.915 --> 25:47.647
I KNOW I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

25:49.548 --> 25:53.082
BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN EVER TRUST ME AGAIN...

25:53.082 --> 25:55.324
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA BEG.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.762
WHY?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.634
WHY?

26:04.634 --> 26:08.698
YES. WHY DO YOU WANT
TO BE WITH ME?

26:08.698 --> 26:10.569
YOU WERE MY LAWYER.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.742
YOU KNOW ALL THE UGLIEST DETAILS
OF MY LIFE--

26:12.742 --> 26:17.076
MY LYING, MY DRINKING,
MY PROMISCUITY.

26:17.076 --> 26:20.049
I WAS ACTUALLY RELIEVED WHEN YOU
PUT GABY ON THE WITNESS STAND

26:20.049 --> 26:23.282
BECAUSE IT EXPLAINED
WHY YOU KISSED ME.

26:23.282 --> 26:26.716
IT WAS A MANIPULATION.
I GOT IT.

26:26.716 --> 26:30.790
BUT TO KEEP SAYING YOU WANT ME
WHEN YOU KNOW HOW...

26:30.790 --> 26:32.922
(whispers)
HORRIBLY FLAWED I AM.

26:35.324 --> 26:39.629
I DON'T TRUST YOU BECAUSE
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.273
HOW ABOUT...

26:44.273 --> 26:47.637
I EXPLAIN IT?

26:55.945 --> 26:57.116
MMM.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.788
DID THAT CLEAR IT UP
FOR YOU?

26:58.788 --> 27:01.090
ALMOST.

27:01.090 --> 27:03.923
LOOK, BREE... (sighs)

27:03.923 --> 27:06.796
ALL THOSE UGLY DETAILS
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, I...

27:06.796 --> 27:09.799
THEY JUST PROVE
THAT YOU'RE HUMAN.

27:09.799 --> 27:11.300
I DON'T WANT TO LOVE
AN IDEAL.

27:11.300 --> 27:13.632
I WANNA--I WANNA LOVE
A REAL PERSON.

27:16.365 --> 27:18.037
(whispers)
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

27:18.037 --> 27:20.269
WELL...

27:20.269 --> 27:22.141
FIRST, WE'RE GONNA WALK OUT
ONTO THAT DANCE FLOOR

27:22.141 --> 27:24.243
AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS
HOW IT'S REALLY DONE.

27:24.243 --> 27:27.346
HOPEFULLY BY THEN,
I'LL GET UP THE COURAGE

27:27.346 --> 27:30.219
TO ONCE AGAIN ASK YOU
TO GO OUT ON A DATE ME.

27:30.219 --> 27:31.650
OF COURSE,
EVEN AS I'M SAYING THAT,

27:31.650 --> 27:34.283
I'M STILL NOT SURE
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.830
DID THAT CLEAR IT UP
FOR YOU?

27:53.202 --> 27:56.205
(tango music playing)

28:03.783 --> 28:07.887
HEY, YOU WANNA DANCE?
THEY'RE PLAYING A TANGO.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.318
WOW. YOU'RE FINALLY TALKING
TO ME AGAIN.

28:09.318 --> 28:11.991
I MUST BE OUT
OF THE DOGHOUSE.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.123
NO, I'M STILL PRETTY MAD.

28:14.123 --> 28:16.796
WHY? IT WAS A JOKE.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.868
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO,
WHEN...

28:18.868 --> 28:20.870
I DID WHAT I DID
WITH JOHN ROWLAND?

28:20.870 --> 28:23.372
THAT IS THE MOST SHAMEFUL THING
IN MY LIFE.

28:23.372 --> 28:26.235
YOU CAN'T MAKE JOKES ABOUT IT.
IT'S TOO PAINFUL.

28:26.235 --> 28:28.107
FAIR ENOUGH.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.409
YOU KNOW...

28:30.409 --> 28:33.012
IT WAS THE MOST SHAMEFUL THING
IN MY LIFE, TOO.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.084
I'M SORRY.

28:35.084 --> 28:36.886
NO.

28:36.886 --> 28:39.448
WHAT'S SHAMEFUL
IS THAT I NEGLECTED YOU.

28:39.448 --> 28:43.893
I HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE,

28:43.893 --> 28:46.395
BUT I FOCUSED
ON ALL THE WRONG THINGS.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.099
IT WAS A TOUGH TIME
FOR BOTH OF US.

28:50.099 --> 28:54.033
I GUESS THAT'S THE POINT
I WAS MAKING HIRING CARMEN.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.235
OUR ROLES ARE REVERSED NOW,

28:56.235 --> 28:57.937
BUT WE CAN'T START DRIFTING AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

28:57.937 --> 29:01.410
I NEVER WANT
TO GO BACK TO THAT AGAIN.

29:01.410 --> 29:03.472
WE WON'T.

29:03.472 --> 29:06.345
WE'VE GROWN UP SINCE THEN.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.377
(chuckles)

29:12.751 --> 29:14.824
ALTHOUGH,
FOR TWO SMART GROWNUPS,

29:14.824 --> 29:16.425
WE SURE SEEM
TO FIGHT A LOT.

29:16.425 --> 29:18.027
(chuckles)

29:18.027 --> 29:21.760
WHY IS IT OTHER COUPLES
SEEM TO WALTZ THROUGH LIFE?

29:21.760 --> 29:24.533
THAT'S EASY.

29:24.533 --> 29:27.296
YOU AND ME?

29:27.296 --> 29:29.438
WE'RE DOING A TANGO.

29:29.438 --> 29:30.769
(kisses)

29:32.441 --> 29:33.772
(exhales sharply)
 (knocks on doorframe)

29:33.772 --> 29:35.374
HEY. I HEAR SOMEONE'S HAVING
A BABY.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.377
OH, YES, A LITTLE
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. SORRY.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.409
NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM. I WAS JUST
PLAYING HOOPS DOWN THE BLOCK.

29:40.409 --> 29:42.381
DON'T WORRY.
I'M GONNA WASH UP,

29:42.381 --> 29:44.914
AND THEN WE'LL GET THIS SHOW
ON THE ROAD. OKAY?

29:44.914 --> 29:47.987
OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT.

29:47.987 --> 29:50.359
DID YOU SEE HIS LEGS?

29:50.359 --> 29:52.161
HOW CAN YOU NOT WANT
TO BE MARRIED TO THOSE LEGS?

29:52.161 --> 29:54.393
(groans) OH, MOM, PLEASE.

29:54.393 --> 29:57.426
RIGHT. I'M ANNOYING. SORRY.

29:57.426 --> 29:59.168
YOU KNOW, IN HONOR
OF THIS SPECIAL DAY,

29:59.168 --> 30:02.401
I PROMISE TO NEVER AGAIN BUG YOU
ABOUT FINDING A HUSBAND.

30:02.401 --> 30:05.434
OH. OHH. (inhales sharply)

30:05.434 --> 30:07.336
EVEN THE BABY KNOWS
YOU'RE LYING.

30:07.336 --> 30:09.108
(chuckles)

30:09.108 --> 30:10.910
OHH.
 (sighs)

30:10.910 --> 30:14.443
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

30:14.443 --> 30:16.185
DO YOU THINK YOU'LL EVER
GET MARRIED AGAIN?

30:16.185 --> 30:17.346
JULIE...

30:17.346 --> 30:18.918
NO, I'M SERIOUS.

30:18.918 --> 30:21.420
YOU'RE STILL YOUNG
AND GORGEOUS.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.322
(laughs) OH, I DON'T KNOW.

30:23.322 --> 30:27.426
(inhales and exhales deeply)

30:27.426 --> 30:29.999
THERE'S A SAYING--

30:29.999 --> 30:31.330
"YOU KNOW
YOU'VE HIT MIDDLE AGE

30:31.330 --> 30:33.002
"WHEN YOUR MEMORIES BECOME
MORE IMPORTANT TO YOU

30:33.002 --> 30:34.203
THAN YOUR DREAMS."

30:35.865 --> 30:39.468
AND I HAVE
SUCH WONDERFUL MEMORIES--

30:39.468 --> 30:40.910
OF MIKE,

30:40.910 --> 30:43.913
AND YOU KIDS GROWING UP,

30:43.913 --> 30:46.415
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS
ON THE LANE.

30:48.878 --> 30:50.349
MM.

30:50.349 --> 30:56.485
OH, DO I HAVE
ONE LAST TORRID ROMANCE IN ME?

30:56.485 --> 30:57.856
MAYBE.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.628
(chuckles)

31:01.160 --> 31:04.563
BUT I KNOW IF I AM
EVER COLD AND LONELY,

31:04.563 --> 31:07.496
I CAN WRAP MYSELF UP
IN ALL THOSE MEMORIES,

31:07.496 --> 31:10.599
AND I WILL BE CONTENT.

31:10.599 --> 31:13.142
(sighs deeply)

31:20.509 --> 31:22.481
(amplified voice)
SO, RENEE AND BEN,

31:22.481 --> 31:25.414
NEVER FORGET
THAT IT TAKES A LOT OF LOVE

31:25.414 --> 31:28.287
TO MAKE A HOUSE A HOME.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.588
AND WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW HOME,

31:29.588 --> 31:30.960
CONSIDER LEE McDERMOTT,
1-800--

31:30.960 --> 31:32.661
GIVE ME THAT!
 (feedback whines)

31:32.661 --> 31:35.424
(amplified voice) OKAY.
MATRON OF HONOR'S TURN.

31:35.424 --> 31:38.627
LYNETTE SCAVO, GIVE US A TOAST.

31:38.627 --> 31:41.230
OH!
 (applause)

31:41.230 --> 31:44.203
(amplified voice)
RENEE AND BEN,

31:44.203 --> 31:46.936
YOUR WEDDING IS ONE
OF THE BEST DAYS OF YOUR LIFE

31:46.936 --> 31:49.078
BECAUSE IT'S THE DAY
YOU REALIZE,

31:49.078 --> 31:53.482
"I FINALLY HAVE THE THING I NEED
TO BE HAPPY."

31:54.513 --> 31:57.546
AND THEN YOU FORGET.

31:57.546 --> 32:00.619
SO... THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS,

32:00.619 --> 32:02.591
INSTEAD OF WAKING UP
EVERY MORNING

32:02.591 --> 32:05.124
AND SHOUTING,
"SOMEBODY LOVES ME!"

32:05.124 --> 32:07.256
YOU START LOOKING AROUND
AND THINKING,

32:07.256 --> 32:09.428
"WHAT DO I WANT NOW?

32:09.428 --> 32:14.163
WHAT'S THE NEXT THING I NEED
TO BE HAPPY?"

32:14.163 --> 32:17.036
SO...

32:17.036 --> 32:18.567
YOU LOOK AND YOU LOOK,

32:18.567 --> 32:22.341
AND YOU KEEP THINKING YOU'VE
FOUND IT, BUT NOTHING WORKS.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.444
AND THE REASON
THAT NOTHING WORKS

32:25.444 --> 32:29.048
IS BECAUSE...

32:29.048 --> 32:34.523
THAT HOLE IN YOUR HEART
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FILL...

32:34.523 --> 32:36.185
IS ALREADY FILLED.

32:40.129 --> 32:43.362
YOU JUST FORGOT.

32:47.636 --> 32:50.599
(chuckles)

32:50.599 --> 32:54.143
DON'T EVER FORGET.

32:54.143 --> 32:59.548
ALWAYS REMEMBER HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED TO BE LOVED,

32:59.548 --> 33:02.551
AND HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOVED.

33:02.551 --> 33:05.484
AND I THINK IF YOU CAN DO THAT--
AND IT ISN'T EASY--

33:05.484 --> 33:10.119
YOU WILL STOP LOOKING
AND REALIZE

33:10.119 --> 33:12.661
YOU ALREADY ARE HAPPY.

33:12.661 --> 33:15.594
TO RENEE AND BEN,

33:15.594 --> 33:17.666
AND TO REMEMBERING. (chuckles)

33:17.666 --> 33:20.469
CHEERS.
 (clinking)

33:20.469 --> 33:22.531
(whispers) I LOVE YOU.

33:22.531 --> 33:24.533
(mouths words)

33:26.705 --> 33:29.708
♪♪♪

33:33.342 --> 33:36.345
(indistinct conversations)

33:38.117 --> 33:41.019
SO... YOU MEANT THAT?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.351
I'M HAPPY.

33:42.351 --> 33:45.194
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

33:48.627 --> 33:52.301
I BET SOMEONE LIKE THAT
COULD BE HAPPY ANYWHERE.

33:52.301 --> 33:54.463
(chuckles)
 MMM.

33:57.566 --> 33:59.608
EVEN NEW YORK.

34:04.613 --> 34:07.516

34:09.578 --> 34:10.649

SUSAN DELFINO MOVED FROM
WISTERIA LANE ON A THURSDAY.

36:34.523 --> 36:36.595
BUT BEFORE SHE LEFT,

36:36.595 --> 36:40.469
SHE WENT TO SPEND A FEW MORE
MOMENTS WITH HER FRIENDS,

36:40.469 --> 36:43.672
DOING WHAT THEY LOVED BEST.

36:43.672 --> 36:45.934
I SEE YOUR 25...

36:45.934 --> 36:47.306
(chip thuds)

36:47.306 --> 36:48.777
AND I RAISE YOU 50.
 (clink)

36:50.279 --> 36:51.480
(clink)

36:51.480 --> 36:52.841
I KNOW YOU'RE BLUFFING.

36:52.841 --> 36:54.343
HOW?

36:54.343 --> 36:55.644
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,

36:55.644 --> 36:58.347
EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A BAD HAND,
YOU TAP THE SIDE OF YOUR GLASS.

36:58.347 --> 37:00.349
NO, I DON'T.

37:00.349 --> 37:01.890
YEAH, YOU DO.

37:01.890 --> 37:03.852
YOU TOTALLY DO.
 ABSOLUTELY.

37:03.852 --> 37:07.526
I HAVE A TELL,
AND YOU GUYS NEVER TOLD ME?

37:07.526 --> 37:10.228
ALL RIGHT,
YOU EACH OWE ME $12,000.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.830
(all chuckle)
 (chips clinking)

37:11.830 --> 37:14.633
I JUST REALIZED
THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST TIME

37:14.633 --> 37:16.835
WE'LL PLAY POKER TOGETHER.

37:16.835 --> 37:18.767
OH, DON'T SAY THAT.

37:18.767 --> 37:20.269
WELL, YOU'RE MOVING,

37:20.269 --> 37:22.741
AND LYNETTE'S TALKING ABOUT
TAKING THAT JOB IN NEW YORK.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.574
OH, WE'LL STILL GET TOGETHER.

37:25.574 --> 37:26.775
I GUESS. IT'S JUST...

37:26.775 --> 37:28.016
WHAT?

37:28.016 --> 37:30.679
I JUST ALWAYS HAD
THIS FANTASY,

37:30.679 --> 37:34.323
THE FOUR OF US STAYING HERE,
GROWING OLD TOGETHER.

37:34.323 --> 37:36.485
YOU KNOW, OUR GRANDKIDS COMING
TO VISIT,

37:36.485 --> 37:39.988
ME STAYING GORGEOUS WHILE
THE THREE OF YOU AGE HORRIBLY.

37:41.730 --> 37:43.832
(laughing loudly)

37:43.832 --> 37:45.964
YOU KNOW SHE'S ACTUALLY
DREAMED ABOUT THAT.

37:45.964 --> 37:47.666
OF COURSE SHE HAS.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.768
NO, SERIOUSLY,

37:49.768 --> 37:54.443
I'M GONNA MISS THIS SO MUCH.

37:54.443 --> 37:56.345
I'M GONNA MISS US.

37:57.706 --> 37:59.508
IT'S FUNNY.

37:59.508 --> 38:03.482
SOME PEOPLE NEVER GET TO KNOW
THE FOLKS NEXT DOOR.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.815
THEY SHARE A FENCE
AND NOTHING ELSE.

38:06.815 --> 38:08.987
AND WE'VE SHARED EVERYTHING.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.862
(sighs) HOW DID WE GET TO BE
SO LUCKY?

38:13.862 --> 38:17.996
I AM SO CRAZY NUTS
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.028
PROMISE ME
THIS IS NOT THE LAST TIME

38:20.028 --> 38:21.830
WE'RE GONNA
PLAY POKER TOGETHER.

38:21.830 --> 38:22.871
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38:22.871 --> 38:24.703
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO
MAKE THE TIME.

38:24.703 --> 38:25.804
OF COURSE WE WILL.

38:28.977 --> 38:32.711
IT WAS A PROMISE MADE
IN ALL SINCERITY,

38:32.711 --> 38:35.844
BUT SADLY,
IT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE.

38:37.746 --> 38:42.891
LYNETTE AND TOM SCAVO
LEFT THE LANE FOUR WEEKS LATER.

38:44.893 --> 38:46.755
THEY MOVED TO NEW YORK,

38:46.755 --> 38:51.460
WHERE LYNETTE LEARNED
THE JOY OF BEING A C.E.O.

38:51.460 --> 38:52.801
SHE AND TOM SOON BOUGHT

38:52.801 --> 38:57.466
A PENTHOUSE
OVERLOOKING CENTRAL PARK...

38:57.466 --> 39:01.740
WHERE, YEARS LATER, SHE'D TAKE
HER SIX GRANDCHILDREN

39:01.740 --> 39:03.612
AND YELL AT THEM.

39:06.515 --> 39:08.116
GABRIELLE AND CARLOS SOLIS

39:08.116 --> 39:11.620
LEFT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

39:11.620 --> 39:14.683
THIS WAS AFTER CARLOS
HELPED HER DEVELOP

39:14.683 --> 39:17.786
A PERSONAL SHOPPING WEB SITE,

39:17.786 --> 39:20.759
WHICH LED TO GABRIELLE
GETTING HER OWN SHOW

39:20.759 --> 39:23.361
ON THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.964
THEY SOON BOUGHT A MANSION
IN CALIFORNIA,

39:25.964 --> 39:29.668
WHERE THEY ARGUED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.872
TWO YEARS LATER,

39:33.872 --> 39:37.906
BREE AND HER NEW HUSBAND
LEFT FAIRVIEW.

39:37.906 --> 39:39.778
THEY MOVED TO LOUISVILLE,

39:39.778 --> 39:43.952
WHERE BREE JOINED A CLUB
FOR CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.

39:43.952 --> 39:49.658
TRIP THEN ENCOURAGED HER
TO ENTER INTO LOCAL POLITICS.

39:49.658 --> 39:52.491
THE FOLLOWING NOVEMBER,

39:52.491 --> 39:57.125
BREE WAS ELECTED TO
THE KENTUCKY STATE LEGISLATURE.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.870
BUT SUSAN DELFINO

40:01.870 --> 40:05.033
WAS THE FIRST TO MOVE
FROM WISTERIA LANE.

40:05.033 --> 40:08.136
AND THIS IS HOW IT ENDED.

40:08.136 --> 40:10.679
SHE INTRODUCED HERSELF

40:10.679 --> 40:13.542
TO THE WOMAN
WHO WAS MOVING IN.

40:13.542 --> 40:15.413
YOU MUST BE JENNIFER.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.745
AND YOU MUST BE SUSAN.

40:16.745 --> 40:18.747
(chuckles) NICE TO MEET YOU.

40:18.747 --> 40:19.888
SORRY IF I'M EARLY.

40:19.888 --> 40:21.690
I, UH, MADE BETTER TIME
THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD.

40:21.690 --> 40:23.822
WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO LEAVE.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.423
MY HOUSE IS YOUR HOUSE.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.595
(both laugh)

40:26.595 --> 40:30.829
I MEAN, LEGALLY,
THIS IS YOUR HOUSE.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.430
(sighs) AHH.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.962
(laughs)

40:33.962 --> 40:36.805
HEY, I HOPE
THAT YOU'LL BE HAPPY HERE.

40:36.805 --> 40:40.569
THANKS. STEVE'S SO EXCITED
TO FINALLY LIVE IN THE SUBURBS.

40:40.569 --> 40:42.711
I'M A LITTLE WORRIED
IT'S GOING TO BE BORING.

40:42.711 --> 40:44.973
OH, I WOULDN'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT.

40:44.973 --> 40:47.215
NOW THIS STREET IS
A LOT OF THINGS.

40:47.215 --> 40:49.918
BORING IS NOT ONE OF THEM.
 (laughs)

40:53.522 --> 40:56.825
(sighs)

40:56.825 --> 40:58.487
CAN WE GO NOW?

40:58.487 --> 40:59.928
YEAH, WE'RE GOING.

40:59.928 --> 41:01.590
(seat belt clicks)

41:01.590 --> 41:03.061
(starts engine)

41:03.061 --> 41:05.063
(sighs)

41:06.835 --> 41:10.599
HEY, DO YOU GUYS MIND IF I TAKE
ONE LAST SPIN AROUND THE BLOCK?

41:10.599 --> 41:13.041
GO FOR IT.

41:13.041 --> 41:16.805
(shifts gears)

41:16.805 --> 41:18.877
AS SUSAN LEFT HER DRIVEWAY,

41:18.877 --> 41:23.081
SHE HAD A FEELING
SHE WAS BEING WATCHED...

41:23.081 --> 41:26.054
AND SHE WAS.

41:26.054 --> 41:29.918
THE GHOSTS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD
BEEN A PART OF WISTERIA LANE

41:29.918 --> 41:32.991
WERE GAZING UPON HER
AS SHE PASSED.

41:32.991 --> 41:37.526
THEY WATCHED HER,
AS THEY WATCH EVERYONE,

41:37.526 --> 41:40.228
ALWAYS HOPING
THE LIVING COULD LEARN

41:40.228 --> 41:43.231
TO PUT ASIDE RAGE AND SORROW,

41:43.231 --> 41:46.134
BITTERNESS AND REGRET.

41:46.134 --> 41:49.678
THESE GHOSTS WATCH,

41:49.678 --> 41:52.781
WANTING PEOPLE TO REMEMBER

41:52.781 --> 41:56.745
THAT EVEN
THE MOST DESPERATE LIFE...

41:56.745 --> 42:02.851
IS OH... SO WONDERFUL.

42:07.626 --> 42:13.802
BUT ONLY A LUCKY FEW REALIZE
THE GIFT THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN.

42:16.034 --> 42:21.109
MOST PEOPLE JUST GO ON
DAY AFTER DAY,

42:21.109 --> 42:22.811
TRYING IN VAIN...

42:22.811 --> 42:25.714
TO KEEP SECRETS...

42:27.676 --> 42:32.050
THAT WILL NEVER STAY HIDDEN.
