00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:13.930


00:14.014 --> 00:15.306


00:21.980 --> 00:23.732


00:23.815 --> 00:25.984


00:26.067 --> 00:30.280


00:30.363 --> 00:32.365


00:32.449 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.163 --> 00:40.957


00:41.041 --> 00:43.877


00:47.005 --> 00:48.381
Where's Chuck, already?

00:48.465 --> 00:51.301
I want to get
this borb tennis game started.

00:51.384 --> 00:54.929
Come on, Stella. We can't play doubles
with only three,

00:55.013 --> 00:57.223
that's like math or something.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.394
Bomb's right, and besides, what's
the one thing we never do to a friend?

01:01.478 --> 01:03.146
Give them a feather wedgie?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.356
But you do that to me all the time.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.442
Yeah. I do.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.320
No, we never leave a friend hanging.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.113
Well, he's leaving us hanging.

01:12.197 --> 01:16.034
I say we go find him and remind him
what we never do to a friend.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.494
Uh, guys?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.290
-Chuckles?
-Chuck? Chucky?

01:23.333 --> 01:24.209
Hey, everyone.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.252
Chuck. How did that happen?

01:26.336 --> 01:27.962
Well, you know how people always
call me an airhead?

01:28.046 --> 01:30.298
Well, I wanted to prove them wrong,
so I took a big rock--

01:30.381 --> 01:34.177
No, we mean what's happening
in your mouth?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.637
Oh, yeah.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.351
But candy's not allowed at camp.

01:43.102 --> 01:46.397
Yeah, I'm still having flashbacks
from the day we arrived.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.780
Welcome to Camp Splinterwood.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.949
Hand over the sweet stuff!

01:56.032 --> 01:56.950
But-- But--

02:02.831 --> 02:05.041
I changed my mind. I want to go home.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.001
This is nothing.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.088
I get a piece of candy from Nurse Brenda's
jar every time I get an injury.

02:10.171 --> 02:11.506
Say what now?

02:12.340 --> 02:15.885
Just tell me I'll be able
to play basebird again.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.056
I promised the hatchlings
I'd coach their little league.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.767
We don't have a basebird field.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.895
Exactly. So I clearly
have a serious head injury.

02:28.356 --> 02:31.067
But it really, really hurts…

02:31.151 --> 02:32.777
on the inside.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.865
Whoa! Oof.

02:36.948 --> 02:39.284
Well, of course, you can't see the blood.

02:39.367 --> 02:42.245
Blood's red. I'm red,
but trust me, it's there.

02:42.328 --> 02:44.622
Mm-mm. You think I can't tell

02:44.706 --> 02:47.458
when someone's faking an injury
to get candy?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.919
I'm a healthcare professional.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.422
No, you're not. You're the lunch lady
in a different hat.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.173
Shows what you know.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.467
It's the same hat turned around.

02:57.051 --> 03:00.179
Now see, here's a real injury.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.515
What'll it be, Chucky? The usual?

03:02.599 --> 03:03.850
Surprise me, B.

03:14.193 --> 03:15.987
So glad I saved you.

03:16.487 --> 03:20.575
It's so unfair you get candy
just by being you.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.327
It's so true.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.746
How about we take turns
licking the lollipop?

03:24.829 --> 03:26.164
Or, hey, wait, I got it.

03:26.247 --> 03:31.669
What if-- bam-- I get myself hurt
to get you all candy?

03:31.753 --> 03:32.921
Whoa.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.964
Mind blown.

03:35.506 --> 03:36.549
Easy, Bomb.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.593
Chuck, as your dear, dear friend,

03:38.676 --> 03:40.136
I can't, in good conscience,

03:40.220 --> 03:43.223
allow you to do something
so reckless, irresponsible,

03:43.306 --> 03:45.350
and frankly, just downright stupid.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.018
Yeah, but candy, though.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.353
Good point. I'm in.

03:48.436 --> 03:50.605
Then let's get to it. Whoo-ee!

03:50.688 --> 03:52.398
W-W-Whoa!

03:52.482 --> 03:53.858
Good start.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.697
Ah, what can I say? It's a gift.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.908
A gift I'm honored to share.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.745
Any newb can aim
for the bullseye,

04:05.828 --> 04:07.830
only a pro knows how to aim--

04:10.250 --> 04:12.335
Beyond!

04:15.129 --> 04:16.631
-

04:20.885 --> 04:23.846
A fresh caramel for my friend, Bomb.

04:25.139 --> 04:28.685
A lot of folks don't know this,
but there's a real art to arts and crafts.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.605
A lollipop for my friend, Red.

04:32.689 --> 04:34.774
Uh, Chuck. That's not a lollipop.

04:36.025 --> 04:37.777
Chuck, can I have a candy?

04:43.533 --> 04:47.161
One for you. And one for you, too,
and you, three.

04:47.787 --> 04:48.955
And one for you.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.542
One for you. And one for you.
And you three!

05:02.677 --> 05:04.304
Waahh! Ugh.

05:04.387 --> 05:08.891
Ah, shucks, I'm only doing it for the love
of finally being loved by everyone.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.185
Way to go, Chuck.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.603
You da bird.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.355
Great day, Chuck.

05:14.439 --> 05:17.859
Now what do you say tomorrow we finally
get in that game of borb tennis?

05:17.942 --> 05:20.069
Hey, wait, I got a better idea.

05:20.153 --> 05:25.158
What if-- bam-- I get myself hurt
to get you all candy?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.787
How about we call it a day now,
huh, Chuck?

05:31.039 --> 05:34.083
What day should we call it?
Oh, I know. Chuck's day.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.668
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

05:35.752 --> 05:37.754
I think I'm gonna go for a troll.

05:37.837 --> 05:40.548
I mean, a stroll for some fresh pear--

05:41.924 --> 05:43.551
Mmm. Pears.

05:45.845 --> 05:46.721
Psst!

05:46.804 --> 05:49.140
I hear they call you the candy man.

05:50.349 --> 05:52.351
Did Chuck seem a little odd to you?

05:52.435 --> 05:54.729
Yeah, classic Chuck.

05:54.812 --> 05:56.230
This isn't classic Chuck.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.400
He's out of his tiny bird brain.
We've gotta do something.

05:59.484 --> 06:02.320
Hey, I just had the most brilliant idea.

06:02.403 --> 06:05.239
Getting candy for just a few campers
was cool,

06:05.323 --> 06:07.950
but imagine if I hurt myself
so spectacularly

06:08.034 --> 06:10.453
I could get enough candy for everyone!

06:10.536 --> 06:13.122
I don't know, Chuck. It sounds--

06:13.206 --> 06:16.209
Awesome! Just imagine,
it would make me a legend.

06:16.292 --> 06:20.254
My name in lights on the stall of fame.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.094
Hey, a little privacy here.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.347
<i>Chuck, we think you have a problem.</i>

06:29.430 --> 06:31.432
You're right.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.684
My problem is
I've been thinking too small!

06:33.768 --> 06:37.313
What I need is a device that will get me
so crazy injured,

06:37.396 --> 06:40.358
Brenda will just give me
the whole candy jar.

06:41.192 --> 06:45.655
I call it The Legend Maker…

06:45.738 --> 06:49.242
Enough is enough, Chuck.
I think you need an injur-vention.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.828
Yeah, it's time to hang up your bandages.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.871
Please don't build the Legend Maker,
Chuck.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.458
Don't worry, Bomb, I won't,
because I already did.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.711
I give you the Legend Maker.

07:03.714 --> 07:04.966
What with the sharpened spoons,

07:05.049 --> 07:07.468
the giant cheese grater,
and carefully arranged gravel,

07:07.552 --> 07:11.097
there isn't a single part of my body
that won't be smashed, crushed, or broken.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.057
Oh. That looks ouchie.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.101
You can't do this, Chuck.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.394
You don't get it.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.063
All my life I've been
laughed at for being a klutz,

07:19.147 --> 07:22.066
but for the first time,
people love me for it.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.067
Aw.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.404
And what if I was put on this Earth
for this very purpose?

07:26.487 --> 07:29.574
What if this is my destiny?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.117
We know this means a lot to you,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.744
but don't you think you're laying this on
a little thick?

07:33.828 --> 07:36.122
I've got to say, I'm a little shocked

07:36.205 --> 07:39.167
to hear you be so unsupportive
of your friend's endeavor.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.837
Oh, I should have known this
was your idea, Neider jerk.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.923
Of course it was. I mean,
Chuck comes up with dumb ideas,

07:46.007 --> 07:47.633
but this is next level dumb.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.011
Nothing dumb about getting me some candy.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.388
Not this time, Neiderflyer.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.098
Chuck's not going anywhere.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.766
Uh, Red?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.399
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

08:03.483 --> 08:04.358
Ugh.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.778
Ahh! Ugh.

08:07.862 --> 08:08.988
We gotta stop him.

08:09.071 --> 08:10.698
But how do we get up there?

08:10.781 --> 08:13.743
Um, hello? We're birds. We'll fly.

08:16.871 --> 08:21.876
Hello, Splinterwood. Who wants candy?

08:21.959 --> 08:24.045
-Yeah!
-Whoo-hoo!

08:26.297 --> 08:28.883
Then let's let Cluck know.

08:28.966 --> 08:29.926
Cluck…

08:30.009 --> 08:32.053
-Cluck, Cluck, Cluck…

08:32.136 --> 08:35.181
-I'm sorry. I'm being told it's Chuck.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.933
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

08:40.269 --> 08:45.024
Time to be immortalized on a filthy
bathroom stall door forever.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.527
-Chuck! No!
-Don't do it!

08:47.610 --> 08:48.903
Oh, hey. What are you doing here?

08:48.986 --> 08:52.615
We came to stop you from doing something
you'll regret for the rest of your life.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.660
Which is going to be real short
if you go through with this.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.412
Sure, but listen to all that love.

09:00.456 --> 09:05.336
I'd rather go out in a blaze of glory
and be remembered as a legend.

09:05.836 --> 09:08.172
But you're already a legend to us.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.090
I am?

09:09.173 --> 09:11.676
Chuck, we are your bathroom stall.

09:13.427 --> 09:16.222
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.266
You're right. What was I thinking?

09:18.349 --> 09:20.685
Bring it in, cheeple.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.230
Sorry, my bad.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.279
Ooh!

09:34.490 --> 09:36.617
Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:08.316 --> 10:09.150
Oh!

10:13.237 --> 10:15.197
Ooh! That's gonna leave a mark.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.993
Thanks for stopping me
from making the worst mistake of my life.

10:19.076 --> 10:23.164
I mean, seeing how painful it was
makes me so glad it didn't happen to me.

10:23.247 --> 10:25.833
Hey, what are friends for, huh? Ow!

10:25.916 --> 10:27.793
Well, at least we're gonna get candy.

10:29.795 --> 10:32.048
Actually, Chuck completely wiped me out.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.009
That's just a jar
full of brightly colored rocks.

10:36.260 --> 10:37.386
Of course it is.
