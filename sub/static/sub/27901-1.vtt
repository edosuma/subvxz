02:16.136 --> 02:17.736
My little Pisces
can't be going to uni.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.505
Isn't she only 12?

02:19.506 --> 02:20.739
Come on mom.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.220
It's not like I'm
moving to Lithuania.

02:22.244 --> 02:23.645
I'll visit heaps.

02:27.013 --> 02:28.413
Why don't I stay
for dinner tonight.

02:28.414 --> 02:31.116
I can move in the morning.

02:31.117 --> 02:33.418
Such a thoughtful child.

02:33.419 --> 02:34.899
Alright, call your
father and tell him

02:34.923 --> 02:36.655
he's only got time
for nine holes.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.390
Will you do your stroganoff?

02:38.391 --> 02:39.392
Of course.

02:42.896 --> 02:46.332
Be a dear and just put that
into the freezer, would you?

02:48.101 --> 02:50.369
That's, oh, that's...

02:50.370 --> 02:53.272
Brian from the underpass.

02:53.273 --> 02:54.707
He's a shocker.

02:59.279 --> 03:02.714
Chris, kind on
skin and body day.

03:02.715 --> 03:03.715
Sorry.

03:05.051 --> 03:06.119
That sucks.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.288
Look, I've never
smoked a day in my life

03:09.289 --> 03:11.223
and now I've got
wrinkles on my feet.

03:11.224 --> 03:12.457
On my feet.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.592
Yeah, well you know what,

03:13.593 --> 03:14.693
I've given up giving up.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.194
Get pregnant.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.063
That's what I did.

03:18.064 --> 03:19.565
Pregnant.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.835
God, I'll be smoking
til I'm a hundred.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.172
Cute kid.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.340
Who?

03:28.341 --> 03:29.661
This one in front of the camels.

03:29.685 --> 03:32.121
Oh, bugger ruined the shot.

03:33.613 --> 03:35.981
Girls, I think I have
to love and leave you.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.183
Karla wants stroganoff
for a farewell dinner.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.464
I thought that was last night?

03:39.488 --> 03:40.488
It was.

03:41.454 --> 03:43.522
I suppose I should
be home tidying up.

03:43.523 --> 03:45.358
Tom moves in tomorrow.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.661
Oh, the point of no return.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.043
Are you girls going to leave me

03:51.067 --> 03:52.497
to drink the wine all by myself?

03:52.498 --> 03:54.166
Oh, Bob will keep you company.

03:54.167 --> 03:55.200
Does he know you're back?

03:55.201 --> 03:57.369
Yeah, we're catching up later.

03:57.370 --> 04:00.873
I hope he's got something
exciting planned.

04:03.543 --> 04:06.044
Gee, how'd I miss that?

04:06.045 --> 04:07.880
Attention to detail.

04:09.248 --> 04:12.517
Anyway, I've always
wanted to go to Tibet.

04:12.518 --> 04:14.353
I prefer Tuscany.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.354
Really?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.897
I was thinking
that next year maybe

04:17.921 --> 04:18.690
the two of us

04:18.690 --> 04:20.058
could go there for
a month or two.

04:20.059 --> 04:20.892
Next year.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.661
Why next year?

04:22.662 --> 04:23.962
I like to plan ahead.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.230
Oh, planning ahead for me

04:25.231 --> 04:28.400
is like what time will I
wake up in the morning.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.402
Christine.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.037
I think it's about time that

04:32.038 --> 04:34.540
you started thinking about us.

04:36.843 --> 04:38.710
Bob, it's been two months.

04:38.711 --> 04:39.978
Nine weeks.

04:39.979 --> 04:40.979
And most of it's
been really great.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.114
Long enough to know

04:42.115 --> 04:43.449
that I love you.

04:45.485 --> 04:47.019
And let's face it,

04:47.020 --> 04:49.622
you're not getting any younger.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.494
You missed a bit.

04:55.495 --> 04:56.562
But, where.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.666
Dave.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.968
Ah, the jungle trekker returns.

05:02.969 --> 05:03.969
How's Africa?

05:03.970 --> 05:05.570
Very wild.

05:05.571 --> 05:07.172
Very African.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.740
Loved it.

05:08.741 --> 05:10.609
Just wish there was more of it.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.711
Back to the drudgery
of the portrait studio

05:12.712 --> 05:14.179
shooting wild children.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.114
Oh, you know how
much I love children.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.349
Oh, I know.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.110
You've got the maternal
instincts of a stick.

05:19.134 --> 05:19.918
Thanks.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.639
You're really just
working for the coffee.

05:21.663 --> 05:23.798
Well you do have
the best coffee.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.527
Dave's studio.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.628
Good, oh yeah, sure.

05:29.629 --> 05:31.297
Okay, how many kids.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.027
Crap.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.308
Blue stripe no,

07:23.309 --> 07:24.709
pink stripe yes.

07:24.710 --> 07:25.545
Blue stripe no,

07:25.546 --> 07:27.579
pink stripe yes.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.414
Blue stripe no,

07:28.415 --> 07:29.749
pink stripe yes.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.819
Blue stripe no,

07:33.820 --> 07:35.220
pink stripe yes.

07:35.221 --> 07:36.455
Blue stripe no.

07:48.334 --> 07:49.602
Blue stripe no.

07:55.641 --> 07:56.641
Phew.

08:01.514 --> 08:02.615
That's great.

08:38.683 --> 08:39.784
Simon.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.952
Hello mom.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.654
Shelly locked me out.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.489
Oh darling.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.725
I'm sorry babe.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.959
What do you need?

08:47.960 --> 08:51.663
You don't mind if
I stay here tonight?

08:51.664 --> 08:53.331
Here in the house?

08:53.332 --> 08:54.332
Ah, yes.

08:55.434 --> 08:56.435
Wait here.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.004
What?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.379
What is it?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.340
Our son's just having a
bit of a domestic issue.

09:09.364 --> 09:10.415
Go back to sleep.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.416
Okay.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.720
Sleep heaps better in a motel.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.855
It's a bit messy here.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.156
Just take the money Simon.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.158
Shelly will take you
back in the morning.

09:20.159 --> 09:20.993
Love you.

09:20.993 --> 09:21.827
Bye bye now.

09:21.827 --> 09:22.662
Bye.

09:22.662 --> 09:23.662
Bye.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.453
Tough love.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.091
It's the latest
thing in parenting.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.746
What are you thinking?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.748
I don't know.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.016
All I know is that

10:18.017 --> 10:21.319
I just can't think
of anything else.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.121
Kids are great.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.922
There are days where you
want to run over them

10:24.946 --> 10:25.524
with a truck,

10:25.524 --> 10:26.392
but you know,

10:26.393 --> 10:27.926
you love them always.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.327
Really?

10:29.328 --> 10:31.329
That why you're so keen
to get them moved out?

10:31.330 --> 10:32.664
Shush.

10:32.665 --> 10:33.865
So no regrets, huh?

10:33.866 --> 10:34.834
No.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.134
No, well they're expensive,

10:36.135 --> 10:37.435
time consuming,

10:37.436 --> 10:38.996
and the source of my
sagging boobs, but,

10:39.020 --> 10:40.288
no, no regrets.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.707
A light period could just
mean the start of menopause.

10:43.731 --> 10:45.667
I am not menopausing.

10:46.412 --> 10:47.412
No.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.115
Bad time in the Bob breakup.

10:50.116 --> 10:52.017
Look, actually forget Bob.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.852
It's not about a relationship.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.387
Just because I
want to have a baby

10:55.388 --> 10:57.922
doesn't mean I want to
have the father around.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.758
I don't want happy families.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.293
I just want a baby.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.063
What about Italy and Russia

11:05.064 --> 11:07.899
and Tibet and all those
amazing jobs you get?

11:07.900 --> 11:10.101
Take the kid with me.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.536
Yeah, right.

11:11.537 --> 11:13.505
Camera in one hand,
brat in the other.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.041
Well think of all the amazing
places it will get to see.

11:16.042 --> 11:18.282
Think of all the amazing
diseases it will get to catch.

11:18.306 --> 11:19.307
Hey Karen.

11:20.312 --> 11:21.546
How's it going?

11:21.547 --> 11:22.987
Well apart from
the varicose veins,

11:23.011 --> 11:23.915
swollen ankles,

11:23.916 --> 11:24.983
collapsed arches,

11:24.984 --> 11:25.984
aching breasts,

11:25.985 --> 11:28.253
piles, irrational mood swings,

11:28.254 --> 11:30.255
a craving for tinned apricots

11:30.256 --> 11:31.356
with tomato sauce,

11:31.357 --> 11:32.824
the asthma from the lamaze class

11:32.825 --> 11:34.865
and the fact that I haven't
had sex in three months,

11:34.889 --> 11:37.128
everything's just peachy.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.129
Water?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.433
Ah, have to pee.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.907
So that's what you want?

11:48.908 --> 11:50.108
I want a baby.

11:50.109 --> 11:50.943
Right.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.210
And with no Bob.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.045
And you don't want
a relationship.

11:53.045 --> 11:53.879
What are you hoping for?

11:53.880 --> 11:55.146
Divine intervention?

11:55.147 --> 11:57.148
Look, I know there
are a hundred reasons

11:57.149 --> 11:58.550
why this is never
going to work but,

11:58.551 --> 11:59.551
it's weird.

12:01.087 --> 12:03.656
It's like nothing else matters.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.563
Maybe it'll blow over.

12:12.331 --> 12:13.611
I hope Christine doesn't think

12:13.635 --> 12:15.433
I'm going to babysit for her.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.069
You really don't
do kids, do you?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.704
Neither do you.

12:19.705 --> 12:20.772
Let's get a cat.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.040
Come on.

12:22.041 --> 12:25.778
We've already doubled
the population in here.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.280
Yeah, pretty much.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.081
Of course I had to throw
out half your clothes

12:31.105 --> 12:32.350
to fit mine in.

12:32.351 --> 12:33.618
Well if you were a girl,

12:33.619 --> 12:35.587
you could have just
shared them with me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.756
If I was a girl,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.625
you might have told me that
you're not actually 37,

12:40.626 --> 12:42.761
but were in fact,

12:42.762 --> 12:43.762
42.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.704
Curious why you lied?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.874
I hate it.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.775
You hate the number 42?

12:57.776 --> 12:58.776
My age.

13:00.479 --> 13:01.614
I hate my age.

13:04.650 --> 13:06.851
Doesn't change anything
as far as I'm concerned.

13:06.852 --> 13:09.354
Honey, this isn't about you.

13:09.355 --> 13:10.355
Okay.

13:14.827 --> 13:16.262
What is it about?

13:18.831 --> 13:20.799
I don't know.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.034
It's, I mean look at her.

13:23.035 --> 13:27.206
Well that's you except
shorter and wearing colors.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.443
That's not me anymore.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.147
Now I'm just

13:37.816 --> 13:38.816
invisible.

13:41.453 --> 13:42.854
I saw you.

13:42.855 --> 13:45.056
You ran me over with
a shopping trolley.

13:45.057 --> 13:46.891
I had to swerve
three times to hit you.

13:46.892 --> 13:47.992
I must have seen you.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.528
You don't understand.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.231
People look straight through me,

13:53.232 --> 13:55.166
like I'm not there,

13:55.167 --> 13:56.735
like I don't exist,

13:58.671 --> 14:00.773
like I'm too old to count.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.579
Okay, sure, you grew up.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.713
Old.

14:08.714 --> 14:09.714
Up.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.383
You're a success Mikki.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.985
You're senior
researcher at the...

14:13.986 --> 14:15.153
Senior.

14:15.154 --> 14:16.287
Senior citizen.

14:16.288 --> 14:17.589
Suddenly I got old and it,

14:17.590 --> 14:20.091
it just terrifies me.

14:20.092 --> 14:21.459
But.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.929
I'm old and I'm saggy.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.635
And I'm disappearing.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.370
Mikki.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.404
Don't.

14:33.405 --> 14:34.405
Just don't.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.067
I really am very sorry.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.136
I know dear.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.839
And it wasn't your fault.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.709
Brutus was such a naughty fellow

15:44.710 --> 15:46.445
when it came to cars.

15:48.147 --> 15:50.615
Did he chase cars often?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.285
Oh yes, especially white ones.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.621
I have a red car.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.823
Where is he now?

15:58.824 --> 16:00.792
Oh, he's in the boot.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.360
I wrapped him in a blanket.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.462
Oh no dear.

16:04.730 --> 16:09.033
Not his poor mangled,
twisted little body.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.569
His beautiful free spirit,

16:11.570 --> 16:15.407
probably bounding across
the fields of heaven.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.510
Chasing white cars.

16:19.511 --> 16:22.914
There are no cars
in heaven silly girl.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.049
No, there's no cars in heaven.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.385
Do you have a dog?

16:27.386 --> 16:28.386
No.

16:30.255 --> 16:31.889
Do your children have a dog?

16:31.890 --> 16:32.890
No.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.963
I actually don't

16:38.964 --> 16:40.965
have any children.

16:40.966 --> 16:41.966
Oh dear.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.471
Neither do I.

16:47.005 --> 16:48.340
But I have dogs.

16:49.608 --> 16:50.709
Lots of dogs.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.480
Dog after dog after dog.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.619
I'm sorry to have
to ask this but,

17:01.620 --> 17:05.522
would you like me to
help you bury Brutus?

17:05.523 --> 17:08.459
That would be very kind.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.061
After a cup of tea.

17:12.564 --> 17:13.564
Sure.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.002
Is there somebody I can call?

17:51.003 --> 17:52.003
Oh.

17:54.039 --> 17:55.039
Who?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.997
Thanks for the flowers Bob.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.233
They're lovely.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.970
So, I was thinking,

20:05.971 --> 20:08.606
summer in Tuscany is really hot.

20:08.607 --> 20:09.541
So if we go in September,

20:09.542 --> 20:10.741
Bob.

20:10.742 --> 20:12.302
We'll still get the
warmth of the sun,

20:12.326 --> 20:15.262
- Bob.
- But it'll be a bit...

20:16.148 --> 20:17.482
I'm sorry Bob.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.620
Winter.

20:28.527 --> 20:29.527
Summer?

20:32.164 --> 20:33.164
I see.

20:36.602 --> 20:37.602
Why?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
I see.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.425
Keith, do you want some pizza?

21:02.728 --> 21:03.795
Sweetie pops?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.699
Just a little light
afternoon rescue mission.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.900
Shelly kicked me out.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.168
Oh, she dumped you.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.437
Well apparently
we're taking a break.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.872
Simon.

21:14.873 --> 21:16.633
I'll just go and get
the rest of the stuff.

21:16.634 --> 21:18.101
You can have a beer out of
the fridge if you want some.

21:18.102 --> 21:19.210
Thanks dad.

21:19.211 --> 21:20.277
Hey.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.512
His stuff?

21:21.513 --> 21:25.049
You know, books, clothes, stuff.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.951
She didn't make
me take everything,

21:26.952 --> 21:28.886
so I guess there's some hope.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.888
Yep, there's always hope.

21:30.889 --> 21:32.790
That she would go
out with a Capricorn.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.558
Yeah, you said that mom.

21:34.559 --> 21:35.826
I have a plan though.

21:35.827 --> 21:37.294
Good for you.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.215
Yeah, you see she thinks
that I'm too unstable,

21:39.239 --> 21:40.464
too unsettled...

21:40.465 --> 21:42.600
Well you do have
your moments Simon.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.803
So, I figured I'd
invite her over for dinner

21:45.804 --> 21:47.038
with you and dad.

21:47.039 --> 21:50.174
Over for dinner with
your father and I?

21:50.175 --> 21:51.709
Yeah, that way she can see

21:51.710 --> 21:55.079
what stability I
really have in my life.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.720
I might get Karla to
come back for it too.

21:56.744 --> 22:00.484
Her and Shelly seem
to get along okay.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.287
But I think I have to let
it cool down for a week,

22:03.288 --> 22:04.955
or two.

22:04.956 --> 22:06.424
It's only temporary, I'm sure.

22:06.425 --> 22:08.959
Hey, what's with
all this art shit in my room?

22:08.960 --> 22:10.194
Art shit?

22:10.195 --> 22:12.163
Since when did you
take up painting mom?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.798
Your mother's quite the artist.

22:13.799 --> 22:15.566
Before I had you and Karla.

22:15.567 --> 22:18.335
Why don't you just
take Karla's room?

22:18.336 --> 22:19.404
Yeah, okay.

22:22.641 --> 22:25.810
Oh, and if you guys aren't
watching anything on TV

22:25.811 --> 22:27.845
there's this really
great anime series on.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.282
It's gross, but it's awesome.

24:29.734 --> 24:31.035
Well, I've got to say,

24:31.036 --> 24:33.370
it's not quite how the
conversation started

24:33.371 --> 24:35.973
when I was rehearsing it.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.309
How did it go?

24:38.176 --> 24:40.044
Pretty standard.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.313
Give me a second chance.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.982
Some if we communicate,

24:44.983 --> 24:47.051
we can work it out,

24:47.052 --> 24:48.620
that sort of thing.

24:49.621 --> 24:50.654
What did I say?

24:50.655 --> 24:51.655
Well in version one,

24:51.656 --> 24:52.690
you melted into my arms

24:52.691 --> 24:54.525
and begged me to take you back.

24:54.526 --> 24:58.363
In version two, you said
you'd think about it.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.967
Version three?

25:05.270 --> 25:09.273
You didn't turn up
for version three.

25:09.274 --> 25:12.309
You see how cruel I can be.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.879
So what do we call this one?

25:14.880 --> 25:15.947
Version four.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.684
The princess and
the sperm donor.

25:20.619 --> 25:21.786
If you like.

25:22.754 --> 25:23.754
No.

25:24.556 --> 25:25.657
Version four,

25:27.859 --> 25:28.860
Bob says no.

25:33.064 --> 25:35.233
Bob says no to being used.

25:36.601 --> 25:38.402
Bob wants a relationship.

25:38.403 --> 25:41.038
Hell Bob even though about
marrying the princess,

25:41.039 --> 25:44.208
but the princess
didn't want that.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.709
She just wanted Bob to be

25:45.710 --> 25:47.344
half a production team,

25:47.345 --> 25:50.782
and then just fade
off into the distance.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.085
Sorry.

25:56.988 --> 25:58.522
I shouldn't have come.

25:58.523 --> 26:00.457
No I'm glad you did,

26:00.458 --> 26:02.826
because this is just
the sort of selfish,

26:02.827 --> 26:05.597
bitch thing that
I needed to see.

26:06.792 --> 26:08.432
I don't know why I've
wasted all this time

26:08.433 --> 26:09.768
pining over you.

26:10.702 --> 26:12.938
You can't do relationships.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.572
There's not enough room in there

26:15.573 --> 26:17.575
for anyone else but you.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.784
You think you can
fit a baby in there?

26:51.810 --> 26:52.810
Oh God.

26:54.412 --> 26:55.412
God no.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.382
No, your estrogen
levels are fine.

26:58.406 --> 27:01.785
So it may not be related
to menopause at all.

27:01.786 --> 27:06.657
Still, night sweats may be
a sign of excessive stress.

27:06.658 --> 27:09.727
Are you stressed about anything
in your life at the moment?

27:09.728 --> 27:11.795
Interest rates.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.798
Global warming and night sweats.

27:14.799 --> 27:19.403
Well, it may be a sign that
you're fitness levels are low.

27:19.404 --> 27:21.839
Do you exercise regularly?

27:21.840 --> 27:25.175
Do you see yourself
as being fit?

27:25.176 --> 27:27.945
Um, how fit do you need to be

27:27.946 --> 27:29.214
to have a baby?

27:30.315 --> 27:31.795
You have to realize
that at your age

27:31.819 --> 27:34.918
to conceive a baby would
be quite difficult.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.587
Your eggs are old.

27:36.588 --> 27:39.323
They're a bit smoked out, so,

27:39.324 --> 27:43.627
your health actually
plays a really big part.

27:43.628 --> 27:45.729
So you better get pretty fit

27:45.730 --> 27:47.231
and give up smoking.

27:47.232 --> 27:48.232
Okay.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.167
So, that's,

27:51.069 --> 27:52.469
lots of fitness.

27:52.470 --> 27:54.973
And lots of giving up smoking.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.779
And lots of sex.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.214
I can do that.

28:04.816 --> 28:06.551
So what do you think?

28:07.419 --> 28:08.886
What is it?

28:08.887 --> 28:10.621
Well I've got to get fit.

28:10.622 --> 28:11.622
Baby fit.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.158
You guys might want to go too.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.192
I've had my kids.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.795
I don't do sweat.

28:23.835 --> 28:26.570
We can cheer you
on enthusiastically.

28:26.571 --> 28:27.571
Go Chris.

28:33.812 --> 28:34.972
Pass the cheese please Margo.

28:34.996 --> 28:36.230
She's flagging.

28:37.482 --> 28:39.349
How long has she been going for?

28:39.350 --> 28:40.751
Four minutes.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.320
Run Forrest, run.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.389
No I don't know
about her technique.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.890
She looks a little bit like

28:46.891 --> 28:48.592
a cross between
a wounded gazelle

28:48.593 --> 28:50.095
and three legged dog.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.236
Do you think if we
put some music on it,

28:53.260 --> 28:53.897
it's help?

28:53.898 --> 28:55.058
I heard that's a good idea.

28:55.082 --> 28:56.200
Hey Chris, do you have.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.768
The Baby Elephant Walk?

28:57.769 --> 28:58.836
You know it's strange,

28:58.837 --> 29:00.671
but that's not really helping.

29:00.672 --> 29:02.606
Do you want to borrow my legs?

29:02.607 --> 29:03.607
Margo.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.182
Ciggy?

29:14.552 --> 29:15.552
Looser.

29:19.524 --> 29:21.084
Do you think we'll
be the god parents?

29:21.108 --> 29:22.025
Of who?

29:22.026 --> 29:23.728
Christine when she has a baby.

29:25.363 --> 29:26.396
If.

29:26.397 --> 29:27.798
When.

29:27.799 --> 29:29.066
Be positive.

29:29.067 --> 29:29.868
I'll be positive if
you can be realistic.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.769
She really wants one.

29:33.471 --> 29:34.972
I know.

29:34.973 --> 29:38.075
No, she really,
really, really wants one.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.777
I really, really, really know.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.698
But we've given her all
the moral support we can.

29:42.722 --> 29:44.391
What else can we do?

29:47.785 --> 29:49.720
Well there is
something you can do.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.321
Yeah, what's that?

29:51.322 --> 29:53.090
Be a sperm donor.

29:53.091 --> 29:54.525
Excuse me?

29:54.526 --> 29:55.559
She knows you.

29:55.560 --> 29:56.827
She likes you.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.348
She's seen how kids
of yours stood out.

29:58.372 --> 29:59.263
She likes them.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.704
I'm not gonna
sleep with Christine.

30:00.705 --> 30:02.305
No, not just sleep
with Christine.

30:02.306 --> 30:04.434
You just need to, you know,

30:04.435 --> 30:05.436
produce the sperm.

30:06.705 --> 30:07.705
I couldn't.

30:07.705 --> 30:08.540
I can't.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.374
Why not?

30:09.374 --> 30:10.308
I can't.

30:10.308 --> 30:11.242
Margo, I'm your husband.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.110
It just wouldn't feel right.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.311
Have you thought about this?

30:14.312 --> 30:15.679
Have ya?

30:15.680 --> 30:16.880
Could you handle the
fact that another child

30:16.881 --> 30:18.081
being out there of mine

30:18.082 --> 30:20.050
that isn't yours?

30:20.051 --> 30:21.518
I'd feel pretty
weird about that.

30:21.519 --> 30:22.953
It's just a thought.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.455
You haven't spoken to
Christine about this?

30:25.456 --> 30:27.224
No, I just thought
about it tonight.

30:27.225 --> 30:28.225
Good.

30:30.295 --> 30:31.295
Okay.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.938
I wonder what it would be
like to sleep with Christine.

30:40.939 --> 30:41.939
Beast.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.008
Oh, Christine.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.510
Oh yeah.

30:47.345 --> 30:48.412
Baby.

30:48.413 --> 30:49.614
Oh, I am going to kill you.

30:54.485 --> 30:55.686
Anyway.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.221
She doesn't appeal to me.

30:57.222 --> 30:58.222
Oh.

30:59.857 --> 31:01.693
She's not you is she?

31:03.061 --> 31:05.141
That was almost soppy
enough for me to forgive you.

31:05.165 --> 31:06.165
Almost?

31:10.635 --> 31:11.803
Do the eyes.

31:13.171 --> 31:14.171
Oh go on.

31:26.084 --> 31:28.086
That's rancid.

31:33.524 --> 31:37.561
I don't think the world's
ready for another child of mine.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.796
Hey mate, I found
this at the back, right?

31:39.797 --> 31:42.232
I think it might need a
little bit of tuning, or?

31:42.233 --> 31:43.500
I don't know, you tell me.

31:43.501 --> 31:45.702
It's beautiful.

31:45.703 --> 31:47.738
I found it about a week ago.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.172
A week ago?

31:49.173 --> 31:50.507
Have a look at it.

31:50.508 --> 31:51.742
I'll have a look at it.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.710
I've gotta get this
coffee sorted out.

31:53.711 --> 31:54.579
Hey.

31:54.579 --> 31:55.446
Hey you.

31:55.446 --> 31:56.281
How are ya?

31:56.281 --> 31:57.181
Good.

31:57.181 --> 31:58.149
Good.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.310
Can I just grab a takeaway?

31:59.334 --> 32:00.869
Yeah, definitely.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.525
Oh.

32:07.525 --> 32:08.525
Oh my God.

32:10.595 --> 32:13.664
Do you think this
actually works?

32:13.665 --> 32:15.400
Sure, doll, try it.

32:50.134 --> 32:51.301
Thanks Joe.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.471
Just put it all on my tab.

34:08.413 --> 34:09.413
What?

35:07.272 --> 35:08.272
Hi.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.073
I was just wondering

35:10.074 --> 35:11.975
do I need to make
an appointment or

35:11.976 --> 35:14.845
can I just come straight?

35:14.846 --> 35:16.713
Oh I just come straight in.

35:16.714 --> 35:18.181
Okay, great.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.182
I will.

35:55.653 --> 35:57.120
She said yes.

35:57.121 --> 35:58.222
She said yes.

35:59.557 --> 36:01.525
Dinner is a happening thing.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.559
When?

36:02.560 --> 36:03.494
Friday night.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.694
Good, I'll be on my best,

36:04.695 --> 36:06.129
most stable behavior.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.231
Yeah right.

36:08.666 --> 36:10.001
Hello Christine.

36:20.645 --> 36:23.080
I'm just gonna go for a walk.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.492
I just couldn't do it.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.093
Seem so impersonal.

36:38.462 --> 36:41.298
Can't pillow talk
with a turkey baster.

36:41.299 --> 36:42.299
I just,

36:44.001 --> 36:46.870
I want to look the father
of my child in the eye.

36:46.871 --> 36:49.172
Even if it's just once.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.741
So find a father.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.778
Right.

36:54.779 --> 36:56.046
Now, shush,

36:56.047 --> 36:57.914
because I'm trying
to capture that sexy,

36:57.915 --> 37:00.484
come knock me up pout of yours.

37:04.922 --> 37:07.924
Find a father, Margo says.

37:07.925 --> 37:08.925
Oh, easy.

37:11.128 --> 37:14.064
Okay, so how
about ex-boyfriends?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.399
Surely there's someone from
your dark mysterious past

37:16.400 --> 37:18.201
who wants a second
bite of the cherry.

37:18.202 --> 37:20.870
I don't know where
any of them are.

37:20.871 --> 37:22.172
What, none of them?

37:22.173 --> 37:23.173
No.

37:24.329 --> 37:25.809
Okay, I make an
excellent detective.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.310
Give me a name.

37:27.311 --> 37:29.380
Who was Mr. Magic in bed?

37:31.816 --> 37:34.252
That would be Terry Cooper.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.887
He was unbelievable.

37:37.888 --> 37:38.922
Fantastic.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.890
Where is he now?

37:39.891 --> 37:40.924
I don't know.

37:40.925 --> 37:41.859
Married, fat,

37:41.860 --> 37:43.928
probably fat and married.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.264
You give up way too easily girl.

37:48.265 --> 37:51.434
What is it you have
against relationships?

37:51.435 --> 37:52.435
Nothing.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.672
They just don't work.

37:55.673 --> 37:57.307
Tell that to Margo and Kieth.

37:57.308 --> 38:00.343
Oh, well they just
don't work for me.

38:00.344 --> 38:03.647
Anyway it's always some
stupid little thing.

38:03.648 --> 38:06.317
You know, there was this one guy

38:07.351 --> 38:10.086
and we were about to have sex.

38:10.087 --> 38:12.089
And he had his socks on.

38:13.090 --> 38:14.592
And I just thought

38:16.294 --> 38:17.294
this is it.

38:18.663 --> 38:20.783
This is what it's going to
be for the rest of my life.

38:20.807 --> 38:21.807
Sock sex.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.401
What?

38:24.402 --> 38:25.769
You broke up with
a guy over socks?

38:25.770 --> 38:27.605
Well symbolic socks.

38:30.508 --> 38:31.775
A toast,

38:31.776 --> 38:33.176
to sock free sex.

38:33.177 --> 38:34.711
Sock free sex.

38:34.712 --> 38:37.048
Unless it makes me pregnant.

38:41.719 --> 38:42.719
Oh my God.

38:44.555 --> 38:45.890
That is so cute.

38:48.259 --> 38:49.660
You are so lucky.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.462
Where's my Tom?

38:52.463 --> 38:53.531
I want a Tom.

38:55.933 --> 38:58.768
Ask and you shall receive.

38:58.769 --> 39:00.003
I can go again.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.684
No, no, no, you stay
right where you are.

39:01.708 --> 39:02.939
It's okay sweet man.

39:02.940 --> 39:05.175
Mikki's been looking after me.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.543
Yes I have.

39:06.544 --> 39:07.877
Cause Mikki loves me.

39:07.878 --> 39:08.978
Yes I do.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.380
Does Tom love me?

39:10.381 --> 39:11.614
Yes he does.

39:11.615 --> 39:12.749
Oh yeah, that's me.

39:12.750 --> 39:13.783
Person of love.

39:13.784 --> 39:14.984
Yay.

39:14.985 --> 39:15.985
Mikki.

39:18.089 --> 39:20.857
Can I have sex with Tom?

39:20.858 --> 39:23.193
Shouldn't
you be asking him that?

39:23.194 --> 39:26.262
Yeah but, I just want
to check with you first

39:26.263 --> 39:28.832
because you know it
wouldn't mean anything.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.100
It would just be for sperm,

39:30.101 --> 39:31.768
and I wouldn't take
any pleasure in it.

39:31.769 --> 39:33.436
Chris, a small problem there.

39:33.437 --> 39:37.373
Oh, you don't find
me sexually arousing.

39:37.374 --> 39:38.309
Oh, no, no.

39:38.310 --> 39:39.709
I've had the snip.

39:39.710 --> 39:40.844
What?

39:40.845 --> 39:42.145
The snip.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.446
A vasectomy.

39:43.447 --> 39:44.681
Shut down the swim team.

39:44.682 --> 39:47.584
Left lane closed to
outbound traffic.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.585
Crap.

39:49.721 --> 39:50.721
Did it hurt?

39:50.722 --> 39:51.855
Well no.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.389
There was anesthetic and all.

39:53.390 --> 39:54.624
But I never knew how much
tubing they have in there.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.905
They pull up a 20
yards of it out

39:55.906 --> 39:57.573
and they cut it and
they tie off the ends

39:57.574 --> 39:58.928
and they burn them.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.963
And I thought...

39:59.964 --> 40:02.031
Okay, thank you.

40:02.032 --> 40:02.967
I'm sorry.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.734
But anyway that's why I can't be

40:04.735 --> 40:06.136
a sperm donor for you Chris.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.104
Well that's okay.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.507
I still love you.

40:10.541 --> 40:11.609
Did you puke?

40:13.677 --> 40:14.978
No, why?

40:14.979 --> 40:17.081
Because I'm gonna puke.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.418
Hello.

40:55.419 --> 40:56.419
Hello.

40:58.522 --> 40:59.690
Miss, hello.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.326
I was actually
saying hello to a?

41:03.327 --> 41:04.961
Christine.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.297
Hello Christine.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.799
Hello Christine.

41:10.134 --> 41:11.367
Hello.

41:11.368 --> 41:13.269
I'm not interrupting
anything am I?

41:13.270 --> 41:15.171
- No.
- No, no, no.

41:15.172 --> 41:16.740
Just making sure.

41:19.076 --> 41:20.076
Sir?

41:21.479 --> 41:22.646
Call triple O.

41:24.181 --> 41:26.616
I got it.

41:26.617 --> 41:27.984
Yeah.

41:27.985 --> 41:28.919
Sir, can you hear me?

41:28.919 --> 41:29.753
Sir?

41:29.754 --> 41:31.354
Ambulance please.

41:31.355 --> 41:32.555
Sir?

41:32.556 --> 41:33.357
Just everybody
move back, alright.

41:33.358 --> 41:34.791
Can you just step back.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.232
I think he's having
a heart attack.

41:36.256 --> 41:38.425
We're at the Jade gardens.

41:39.864 --> 41:42.165
Yeah, the botanical gardens.

41:42.166 --> 41:46.003
Yeah, someone's giving
him CPR right now, yes.

41:49.840 --> 41:50.840
Okay, yeah.

41:59.344 --> 42:00.384
Come on girls, let's go.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.651
Goodbye.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.186
Bye.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.921
Bye bye.

42:04.922 --> 42:05.856
Thank you.

42:05.856 --> 42:06.856
Bye bye.

42:14.598 --> 42:16.266
I love you.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.700
Must be my fatherly smile.

42:17.701 --> 42:18.981
Or the endless
supply of lollies.

42:19.005 --> 42:19.969
Do you want a lolly?

42:19.970 --> 42:20.970
Pass.

42:21.972 --> 42:26.042
Hey, how long have
we known each other?

42:26.043 --> 42:27.277
Long enough for me to know

42:27.278 --> 42:28.711
you're about to
ask for something,

42:28.712 --> 42:30.952
which is okay because I'm
about to ask you for something.

42:30.976 --> 42:33.044
Mine's pretty personal.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.418
Mine too.

42:35.419 --> 42:38.255
Should we get all
serious and sit?

42:47.765 --> 42:49.266
Okay, you first.

42:51.502 --> 42:52.982
I went to the
doctor's the other day

42:53.006 --> 42:56.306
and I found out I have
developed diabetes.

42:56.307 --> 42:57.587
I guess I shouldn't
be surprised,

42:57.611 --> 42:59.542
it runs in the family.

42:59.543 --> 43:00.843
Diabetes.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.245
Yep.

43:02.246 --> 43:04.126
So I have a life of
sticking needles into myself

43:04.150 --> 43:05.782
to look forward to.

43:05.783 --> 43:07.050
Sorry.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.618
It's not a big deal really.

43:08.619 --> 43:09.819
Anyways, so the favor is this,

43:09.843 --> 43:11.554
I need a friend or a workmate

43:11.555 --> 43:14.891
to carry around a couple
of spare insulin doses

43:14.892 --> 43:16.226
for emergencies.

43:17.595 --> 43:18.828
So you want me to
carry a couple of needles

43:18.829 --> 43:19.862
and put them in my bag?

43:19.863 --> 43:21.097
Basically yeah, and a vile.

43:21.098 --> 43:23.566
Hey what happens
if I'm in Tibet?

43:23.567 --> 43:24.901
Is that likely?

43:24.902 --> 43:26.369
Maybe,

43:26.370 --> 43:28.104
if they like my African photos.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.339
Well if you're in Tibet,

43:29.340 --> 43:30.940
I shall just cling
tenaciously to life

43:30.941 --> 43:32.675
until you get back.

43:32.676 --> 43:34.277
But enough about me.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.778
What's this favor
I can do for you?

43:35.779 --> 43:38.982
You know what, it
doesn't really matter.

43:38.983 --> 43:40.016
You sure.

43:40.017 --> 43:42.620
I think I just worked it out.

43:57.768 --> 43:59.435
Okay.

43:59.436 --> 44:00.437
Let's do it.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.325
You are so funny.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.027
And you smell so...

44:24.028 --> 44:25.895
Oh my God.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.797
I'm actually not that hungry.

44:27.798 --> 44:29.465
Nor am I,
I just think we should go

44:29.466 --> 44:31.435
straight to your place.

44:53.057 --> 44:55.425
Your name's not Bob is it?

44:55.426 --> 44:56.860
No, it's Roger.

44:57.795 --> 44:59.262
But if you want,

44:59.263 --> 45:00.630
I could be Bob.

45:00.631 --> 45:01.831
Call me Bob.

45:01.832 --> 45:02.666
No, no, no.

45:02.667 --> 45:04.200
Roger's good.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.802
It's a good name.

45:05.803 --> 45:07.837
It's a good strong, fertile,

45:07.838 --> 45:08.839
virile name.

45:21.085 --> 45:23.153
Three, you are in luck.

45:26.623 --> 45:27.623
Holy crap.

45:37.434 --> 45:38.434
Wait here.

46:16.306 --> 46:17.374
Sandra, wait.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.701
Auntie Christine?

46:45.702 --> 46:47.103
Ah, hi Karla.

46:47.104 --> 46:48.371
Wow, you look amazing.

46:48.372 --> 46:50.106
And this is?

46:50.107 --> 46:51.274
Tony.

46:51.275 --> 46:52.708
Hi Tony.

46:52.709 --> 46:54.509
I don't suppose I could
grab a lift off you?

46:54.533 --> 46:56.179
Yeah, sure I'm not
doing anything else.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.747
You want a ride too Tony?

46:57.748 --> 46:59.682
You were going to cab
it, weren't you Tony?

46:59.683 --> 47:01.484
Well a lift would be great.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.587
Well my car's this way.

47:19.269 --> 47:21.370
Thanks again Auntie Christine.

47:21.371 --> 47:22.805
You're welcome.

47:22.806 --> 47:23.907
Bye.

47:26.211 --> 47:27.211
Get in the front Tony.

47:27.212 --> 47:28.779
I'm not a chauffer.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.521
Where do you live?

47:37.521 --> 47:38.422
With my parents?

47:38.422 --> 47:39.289
Oh, very modern.

47:39.290 --> 47:40.923
But I need an address.

47:40.924 --> 47:41.758
Riverside.

47:41.759 --> 47:42.759
Riverside.

47:50.434 --> 47:53.236
I'm not Karla's boyfriend.

47:53.237 --> 47:54.503
Yep.

47:54.504 --> 47:55.739
I can see that.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.674
We just met tonight at a party.

47:58.675 --> 48:00.243
It's pretty dull, so,

48:00.244 --> 48:02.446
I suggested we go clubbing.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.585
You do look amazing.

48:09.586 --> 48:10.586
Thanks.

48:13.357 --> 48:16.292
But Karla's not my type.

48:16.293 --> 48:18.362
What is your type Tony?

48:20.897 --> 48:23.532
I like my women more,

48:23.533 --> 48:24.533
mature.

48:32.142 --> 48:33.142
Really?

48:37.147 --> 48:39.782
Mature enough for you Tony?

48:39.783 --> 48:42.452
So, you're not diabetic are you?

48:43.353 --> 48:44.787
No.

48:44.788 --> 48:48.492
Good, what about a
history of heart disease?

48:49.760 --> 48:50.760
Nice puppy.

48:52.663 --> 48:54.297
Or dyslexia, you know.

48:54.298 --> 48:55.298
Anorexia?

48:56.533 --> 48:57.767
Good.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.036
I'm a virgin.

49:02.072 --> 49:03.072
By choice.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.442
By what?

49:05.443 --> 49:07.076
Choice.

49:07.077 --> 49:09.478
You know, saving
myself for marriage.

49:09.479 --> 49:11.247
You mean your gonna give up

49:11.248 --> 49:13.750
the best sex you've never had?

49:16.720 --> 49:18.121
Are you sure now?

49:19.523 --> 49:20.523
Really?

49:21.725 --> 49:23.059
Yes.

49:23.060 --> 49:24.995
Positive?

49:30.167 --> 49:31.835
Can we still kiss?

49:34.071 --> 49:35.739
I'm saving myself.

49:37.274 --> 49:38.841
Riverside.

49:38.842 --> 49:39.843
Riverside.

49:42.212 --> 49:44.413
Saving himself for
marriage, really?

49:44.414 --> 49:45.881
What's wrong with
kids these days?

49:45.882 --> 49:47.242
I mean you wait
til you're drowning

49:47.266 --> 49:48.501
to have swimming lessons?

49:49.252 --> 49:50.619
I think it's sweet,

49:50.620 --> 49:52.722
in a totally misguided
pointless kind of way.

49:52.723 --> 49:54.290
Why is it so hard

49:54.291 --> 49:56.225
to find a genetically
suitable male

49:56.226 --> 49:57.827
who wants to have
unprotected sex

49:57.828 --> 50:00.497
and a get out of jail free card?

50:02.299 --> 50:04.968
Do you want to have sex with me?

50:06.870 --> 50:09.272
That will be 23.50, thanks.

50:12.042 --> 50:13.042
Thank you.

50:15.345 --> 50:16.579
See.

50:16.580 --> 50:17.913
Is it me?

50:17.914 --> 50:19.081
Am I hideous?

50:19.082 --> 50:20.516
Am I too old?

50:20.517 --> 50:21.617
Do I smell?

50:21.618 --> 50:23.720
Am I too tall, too short?

50:24.988 --> 50:25.988
Is it me?

50:27.157 --> 50:30.326
Or is it just Mother
Nature being a total bitch?

50:30.327 --> 50:32.047
I'm going to make you
want something so bad,

50:32.071 --> 50:33.763
and then I'm going to make sure

50:33.764 --> 50:35.599
that you don't get it.

50:37.367 --> 50:40.302
I wanted to be the Pope once.

50:40.303 --> 50:41.638
I was 11 though.

50:42.572 --> 50:43.973
It'll happen Chris.

50:43.974 --> 50:44.974
When?

50:45.842 --> 50:47.743
Time is not on my side.

50:47.744 --> 50:50.146
Let's face it, it's
batting for the other team.

50:50.147 --> 50:52.214
How old's this
Tony guy meant to be?

50:52.215 --> 50:53.215
23 or 24.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.387
Oh, I'm nearly 23.

51:51.708 --> 51:54.544
Yeah, I'm pretty small actually.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.647
My ass is big though.

51:59.816 --> 52:02.319
I think it's going to be a boy.

52:20.470 --> 52:22.004
Don't be alone tonight.

52:22.005 --> 52:24.473
There are hundreds of guys
and girls waiting for you

52:24.474 --> 52:25.475
at iDate.com

52:26.843 --> 52:29.111
for a day or for a lifetime.

52:29.112 --> 52:32.014
IDate.com is the largest
and most trusted...

52:32.015 --> 52:33.516
Am I really that desperate?

52:33.517 --> 52:35.718
Do you want to know the secret

52:35.719 --> 52:37.119
to a successful love life.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.788
IDate.com.
Yes I am.

52:41.858 --> 52:42.858
A baby?

52:43.560 --> 52:46.129
Whoa, slow down there Chrystal.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.864
Ah, it's Christine.

52:48.865 --> 52:50.165
Christine.

52:50.166 --> 52:51.867
I've been on way too
many of these dates

52:51.868 --> 52:53.369
to rush into anything.

52:53.370 --> 52:54.337
Kids?

52:54.338 --> 52:55.371
You want a kid?

52:55.372 --> 52:57.540
I'll give you one of mine.

52:57.541 --> 52:58.774
I've got seven of them

52:58.775 --> 53:00.142
and I'm sick of
the little buggers.

53:00.143 --> 53:01.544
Yeah, well I've
misses pissed off.

53:01.545 --> 53:03.145
I said to myself,

53:03.146 --> 53:06.248
Henry, someone's got
to look after her.

53:06.249 --> 53:08.084
You are paying, right?

53:09.219 --> 53:10.419
Come on, he's full of semen.

53:10.420 --> 53:13.123
They call me, come on.

53:17.761 --> 53:19.295
I've prepared a questionnaire

53:19.296 --> 53:20.896
that I'd like you to fill
out before our next date.

53:20.897 --> 53:22.431
You're a bit of
a screamer are ya?

53:22.432 --> 53:23.832
I love the screamers.

53:23.833 --> 53:25.235
Come on.

53:28.371 --> 53:29.371
Ah.

53:30.907 --> 53:32.241
Christine.

53:32.242 --> 53:34.710
The questions with
the stars next to them

53:34.711 --> 53:35.711
are compulsory.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.213
Who's your daddy?

53:37.214 --> 53:38.281
Who's your daddy?

53:39.950 --> 53:41.283
Come on.

53:41.284 --> 53:42.284
Come on.

53:51.261 --> 53:52.294
That was great mom.

53:52.295 --> 53:54.330
Thank you Simon.

53:54.331 --> 53:56.098
Now us oldies get
the joy of washing up.

53:56.099 --> 53:57.266
Oh no, I'll help.

53:57.267 --> 53:58.834
As if.

53:58.835 --> 53:59.769
Can I have your plate, darling?

53:59.769 --> 54:00.570
No, no, it's alright.

54:00.570 --> 54:01.438
I've got it.

54:01.439 --> 54:02.571
I'll get some coffee.

54:02.572 --> 54:03.839
Thanks mom.

54:03.840 --> 54:04.841
Thank you.

54:07.677 --> 54:08.877
Dinner was lovely.

54:08.878 --> 54:11.413
Yeah, mom went all out.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.482
Hey, I know what
Simon's trying to do.

54:13.483 --> 54:14.883
And?

54:14.884 --> 54:17.654
It's not gonna work between us.

54:19.623 --> 54:22.525
And why are you
telling me first?

54:23.693 --> 54:25.861
I came here tonight
for another reason.

54:25.862 --> 54:26.862
What?

54:32.202 --> 54:33.202
No.

54:34.838 --> 54:35.904
I just thought that...

54:35.905 --> 54:36.905
No.

54:38.241 --> 54:39.775
Dad.

54:39.776 --> 54:40.710
Can you call a cab?

54:40.711 --> 54:42.044
Shelly has to go.

54:42.045 --> 54:43.178
Shelly?

54:43.179 --> 54:44.647
Right now.

54:44.648 --> 54:46.181
What's going on?

54:46.182 --> 54:48.484
I'm gonna wait outside.

54:48.485 --> 54:49.485
Shelly?

54:50.487 --> 54:51.487
Shelly.

54:52.222 --> 54:53.222
Shelly.

54:54.457 --> 54:56.925
No wonder she kept asking
if you'd be at dinner.

54:56.926 --> 54:59.262
I should send her
the grocery bill.

55:00.797 --> 55:02.031
I'm sorry mom.

55:02.032 --> 55:03.672
I guess you're stuck
with me a bit longer.

55:03.696 --> 55:05.300
Oh Simon.

55:05.301 --> 55:08.137
You can stay as
long as you like.

55:08.138 --> 55:12.007
I'll just move my art
shit into Karla's room.

55:12.008 --> 55:14.443
Why don't we move in together?

55:14.444 --> 55:16.779
We can find somewhere
small and cheap.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.647
I've heard of worse ideas.

55:18.648 --> 55:20.968
And your father and I'd be
happy to help out with the rent,

55:20.969 --> 55:21.804
wouldn't we.

55:21.805 --> 55:22.618
Happily.

55:22.619 --> 55:23.979
And I already
know you're a slob,

55:24.003 --> 55:25.154
so I won't kick you out.

55:25.155 --> 55:27.436
Do you promise not to turn
my girlfriends into lesbians?

55:29.192 --> 55:30.392
What do you think Margo?

55:30.393 --> 55:33.997
Well, I'd be very
sad to see you both go.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.800
Can you move out tonight?

55:39.369 --> 55:40.870
Gee, thanks mom.

55:46.609 --> 55:47.743
Smile for the camera.

55:47.744 --> 55:48.977
Oh no, Tom, don't.

55:48.978 --> 55:49.913
Come on, just one.

55:49.914 --> 55:51.074
I don't have any makeup on.

55:51.075 --> 55:52.635
You don't need
makeup, come on just...

55:52.659 --> 55:53.016
Don't.

55:53.016 --> 55:53.950
Come on.

55:53.950 --> 55:54.950
Cheese.

58:20.598 --> 58:21.758
You're not on today are ya?

58:21.782 --> 58:22.782
Dave?

58:23.266 --> 58:25.133
I need some extra work.

58:25.134 --> 58:26.668
Nothing full time, but,

58:26.669 --> 58:28.937
if you can throw any of
your overflow my way,

58:28.938 --> 58:30.273
that'd be great.

58:31.207 --> 58:33.642
I'm going to have a baby.

58:33.643 --> 58:34.977
Okay.

58:34.978 --> 58:36.445
Sure.

58:36.446 --> 58:37.646
Well that was easy.

58:37.647 --> 58:38.780
Well babies are expensive.

58:38.781 --> 58:40.282
Exactly.

58:40.283 --> 58:42.551
Well the wedding
market pays well.

58:42.552 --> 58:45.153
Nightmare work, but good
money without too much time.

58:45.154 --> 58:47.422
And you've worked
with wild animals,

58:47.423 --> 58:49.191
so wedding parties
won't be a stretch.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.692
What happened to Tibet?

58:50.693 --> 58:52.160
Oh no, that's
still on the cards,

58:52.161 --> 58:54.730
but I just need to seriously
start saving right now.

58:54.731 --> 58:56.465
Very responsible of you.

58:56.466 --> 58:58.000
Thank you

58:58.001 --> 58:59.001
in advance,

59:00.537 --> 59:02.304
for the bucket loads of work.

59:02.305 --> 59:03.305
Gotta dash.

59:05.308 --> 59:07.377
I'm going to have a baby.

59:17.387 --> 59:19.855
Oh, hello Christine.

59:19.856 --> 59:20.856
Hi.

59:22.058 --> 59:23.792
I actually don't know your name.

59:23.793 --> 59:25.027
Oh, Paolo.

59:25.028 --> 59:25.929
Sorry.

59:25.929 --> 59:26.863
Paolo.

59:26.864 --> 59:27.896
Yes.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.399
It's official now.

59:30.566 --> 59:32.501
We're not stalking
each other anymore.

59:32.502 --> 59:33.869
Yes.

59:33.870 --> 59:35.237
We have

59:35.238 --> 59:37.239
seen each other
around quite a bit.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.808
Yes, yes we have.

59:39.776 --> 59:41.944
How's that old man by the way?

59:41.945 --> 59:43.045
Oh George.

59:43.046 --> 59:44.479
George is fine.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.480
A minor heart attack,

59:45.481 --> 59:46.782
and a bitterly disappointed

59:46.783 --> 59:49.117
about having to
quit smoking, but,

59:49.118 --> 59:50.285
he's fine.

59:50.286 --> 59:51.920
Well I hope he thanked you.

59:51.921 --> 59:52.921
He did.

59:58.628 --> 01:00:00.495
So now we meet at the reception

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.397
of a sperm bank.

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:03.398
Yes.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.501
Revealing, don't you think.

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:07.502
Uh huh.

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.805
Were you uh,

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:10.939
donating?

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:12.207
Yes.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.242
Yes, I do it every
six months or so.

01:00:14.243 --> 01:00:15.243
Ah.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.213
You don't have someone
that you specifically

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.214
donate to?

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.850
No, no, no, no.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:24.453
I'm not in a relationship, no.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:27.656
I'm just going to
say this straight out.

01:00:27.657 --> 01:00:30.025
Would you donate to me?

01:00:30.026 --> 01:00:32.094
Here on the steps?

01:00:32.095 --> 01:00:33.596
No, I'm serious.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.599
You want a baby Christine?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600
Yes.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.670
From me specifically?

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:43.071
I mean you don't
know much about me.

01:00:43.095 --> 01:00:44.095
No, I,

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.908
well apart from the fact
that you save people.

01:00:46.932 --> 01:00:48.934
And you play the violin.

01:00:49.879 --> 01:00:52.714
And you're, you're
kind of gorgeous in a

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:53.883
buff, healthy,

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:56.886
kind of way.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.191
Okay, well should
we make arrangements?

01:01:03.192 --> 01:01:04.192
Yeah.

01:01:04.193 --> 01:01:05.061
Yeah?

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:06.595
Yeah.

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.063
Or,

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.064
Or?

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:13.001
Or,

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:18.074
you could donate
to me privately.

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.042
Yes.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:22.011
Yes, I could.

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:29.651
Although that may
complicate things a bit.

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.652
Ah.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.255
I mean if we really
like each other

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.524
then we may want to start
hanging out together,

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:39.462
and I'm quite happy the
way I am at the moment.

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:41.963
You don't want

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:43.965
a relationship?

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:44.966
No.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.005
Neither do I.

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.176
Yes.

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.177
Thank you.

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:03.785
Coffee?

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:13.028
Hello?

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.398
Hi Mr. Hodges.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.533
Yes.

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.171
Yes, I would love
to go to Tibet.

01:02:23.272 --> 01:02:25.640
Oh no, look I understand.

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:29.478
But it can't be any worse
than the mud huts in Papua.

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:30.879
Yeah, no, no, my
shots will be fine.

01:02:30.903 --> 01:02:33.639
My doctor love
giving me needles.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:36.385
Yeah, oh, okay.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.020
Okay.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.856
I'm so excited.

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.992
Thank you, thank you Mr. Hodges.

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:44.993
Okay, bye.

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:49.397
Oh my God.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:21.797
Mr. Hodges hi, it's
Christine again.

01:03:21.798 --> 01:03:25.902
Sorry, listen, I'm gonna
have to say no to Tibet.

01:03:29.205 --> 01:03:31.207
It's a family situation.

01:03:32.708 --> 01:03:34.809
But listen, thank you so much.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.145
I am, I'm sorry.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180
Bye.

01:03:54.363 --> 01:03:55.798
Your wine madam

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.603
what's this?

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.205
An option.

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.540
A serious one?

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.541
Maybe.

01:04:07.944 --> 01:04:08.944
Eventually.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:12.581
I see.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:18.120
Well I can't live on sticky
notes and complements forever.

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:22.158
Not even the ones I do believe.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:43.405
Should I get the lights?

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:44.406
No.

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.408
It's okay.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.442
You sure?

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:48.443
Yeah.

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:15.303
Madam.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.113
So you can cook too?

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.481
Now is that genetic?

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.482
No idea.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.920
Is there anything you can't do?

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.689
Cryptic crosswords,

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.058
and I can't draw
to save my life.

01:06:37.059 --> 01:06:38.993
Anything beyond stick figures

01:06:38.994 --> 01:06:40.995
and I'm hopeless.

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.556
Oh well, it's no
wonder you're single.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.580
Yep.

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:47.069
What's your story?

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.073
Well I can't help but

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:55.510
tear the label off
any bottle I see.

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.380
Oh, that would doom
any relationship.

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.982
Stay out of my cellar.

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:01.917
Okay.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.917
Okay.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.290
So,

01:07:12.361 --> 01:07:13.361
So.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.931
We finished dinner.

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:18.100
Yes we have.

01:07:23.305 --> 01:07:24.305
So.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:26.908
So.

01:07:28.477 --> 01:07:30.779
So you and I are going upstairs

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.715
to attempt to conceive.

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:35.150
Uh huh.

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:36.151
And...

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.588
And what happens then?

01:07:42.391 --> 01:07:43.391
Well.

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:46.861
Nothing has to happen.

01:07:46.862 --> 01:07:49.330
But unless nothing happens.

01:07:49.331 --> 01:07:50.698
Oh.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:53.301
Then it might have to
happen again in about

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:54.302
28 days.

01:07:58.741 --> 01:08:00.675
Is there anything
we need to talk about?

01:08:00.676 --> 01:08:02.811
You know, like naming rights or?

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:04.612
Ah yes, my family.

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.748
I'm being serious.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:10.385
It's going to be
your baby Christine.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.321
I know you say that now but,

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.157
what happens when you,

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:18.127
you see it in the flesh?

01:08:20.629 --> 01:08:21.629
Honestly,

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:26.602
I don't know.

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:31.171
But that's a good nine
months down the track.

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:34.809
Who knows, I may have
moved to Venezuela by then.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.314
Or I might just get
hit by a bus tomorrow.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:42.050
Great way to kill the mood.

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.451
Oh.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:45.187
Is there a mood here?

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:51.993
I don't know, is there?

01:08:52.928 --> 01:08:54.997
I don't know, is there?

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:57.999
I don't know, is there?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.102
I don't know, is there?

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:03.571
I don't know, is there?

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.073
I don't know, is there?

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:06.341
Oh shit.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:07.341
Yeah.

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:17.151
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:18.754
This is for me now.

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:23.191
And you can have some after.

01:09:23.192 --> 01:09:24.192
Oh.

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:26.294
Incentive.

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:31.634
So, I'm going into the bathroom,

01:09:32.501 --> 01:09:34.002
and when I come out,

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:35.537
I expect to see you

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:36.538
on that bed,

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:39.073
naked.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:42.545
Yes ma'am, naked.

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:48.617
And no socks.

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.754
Especially no socks.

01:09:52.888 --> 01:09:53.888
Naked,

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.191
no socks.

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.660
Got it.

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:19.714
Shoes off.

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:28.390
Pants are coming off.

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.129
Now the shirt comes off.

01:10:37.132 --> 01:10:39.201
And socks are coming off.

01:10:49.078 --> 01:10:51.246
Oh, very funny sock man.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:12.900
Paolo?

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:22.210
Oh.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:44.198
Ah.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:57.912
Shit.

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:01.449
You sure it was an aneurism?

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.450
Yeah.

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:06.822
The universe is not this cruel.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.725
My baby's in there.

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.528
Do you think it's too late for?

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:14.496
Mikki.

01:12:14.497 --> 01:12:16.097
He's dead.

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:19.201
Mind you, if we get
a vacuum cleaner,

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:21.035
big enough.

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.975
There is another possibility,

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.744
Dave's syringes.

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:31.245
Will it work?

01:12:31.246 --> 01:12:32.313
Hair grows.

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.948
Nails grow.

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.384
Sperm lives.

01:12:37.086 --> 01:12:38.086
Go.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:40.355
Are you gonna?

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:41.356
Yes.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.623
You can't.

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:43.891
Yeah, well just watch me.

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:44.693
We don't have time for
a moral debate about it.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.927
The ambulance is here.

01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.195
Lock the door.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.797
We should check
for a diners card.

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:52.066
Okay, they're out
of the ambulance.

01:12:52.067 --> 01:12:53.568
Walking down the path.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.103
Coming in the house.

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:57.264
If there was was ever a name
for premature ejaculation.

01:12:57.288 --> 01:12:57.773
Oh shh.

01:12:57.774 --> 01:12:59.140
What do you think?

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.109
Higher.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:01.150
Lower, closer to the...

01:13:01.174 --> 01:13:02.174
Penis.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:04.879
Damn.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.348
A little help please.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.583
Is there a patron saint

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.864
for post mortem
sperm extraction?

01:13:09.888 --> 01:13:11.352
Sounds more like
a Roman god thing.

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.587
Oh, who's that one

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:14.388
that would turn into a
bull and seduce queens?

01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:15.623
Everyone just pick someone

01:13:15.624 --> 01:13:17.391
and start to pray.

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:18.392
Okay.

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:21.229
Got it.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.864
Whoa, that's a lot.

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.499
What now?

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:25.500
Orgasm.

01:13:30.606 --> 01:13:32.373
Oh, they're coming
up the stairs.

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:33.508
Who did you pray to?

01:13:33.509 --> 01:13:34.509
Hurry up.

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.779
Skip the foreplay and
don't use it all at once.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:38.846
What?

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.515
Not all at one time.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.450
What do you suggest?

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:43.451
Wait.

01:13:45.954 --> 01:13:47.989
Ma'am, is the door locked?

01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.891
Ma'am?

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:50.725
It's stuck.

01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:54.730
Humidity, you know what
the weather's been like.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:59.267
Oh, lie down, gravity bad.

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.335
Ma'am?

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:06.441
She fainted.

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:07.742
Shock.

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.277
She's a Gemini.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:10.446
And he's dead.

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:14.781
Do you want to come
to the hospital with us?

01:14:14.805 --> 01:14:16.250
In the same ambulance, no.

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:17.518
We'll just look after her here.

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.454
She just needs to
rest on her back.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:20.621
Don't want the

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:21.823
blood to go rushing out of

01:14:21.824 --> 01:14:23.224
your head,

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.226
for example.

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.297
Margo, could I see
you for a minute please?

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:30.265
Are you alright?

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.099
Me?

01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:32.266
Oh, fine.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.101
Margo?

01:14:33.102 --> 01:14:34.769
Yes, no, I'm good too.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.338
Oh, are you single?

01:14:46.014 --> 01:14:47.248
We should freeze these.

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:48.729
We can't walk out
past the ambulance

01:14:48.753 --> 01:14:51.352
carrying two sperm
filled condoms.

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:53.321
What is that for?

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:54.555
Oh, you are kidding.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:56.036
The best chance
for sperm to survive

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:57.725
is at body temperature.

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:59.260
Body temperature.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.463
She'd do the same for us.

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:05.059
You know, in 24
years of marriage

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:08.836
I have told Keith
absolutely everything.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:12.107
I don't think I'll
tell him about this.

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:27.256
We can't stay
horizontal forever.

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:44.572
Keith.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.342
Bring the station wagon.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.368
Do you need anything?

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:15.604
No, I'm fine.

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.840
Chris, you're in shock.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.510
Can't imagine why.

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:25.212
You can come and stay
with me if you'd like.

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:26.647
No, no.

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.250
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.620
We're just a phone
call away if you need us.

01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:33.621
Thanks.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:49.738
Well it can't hurt.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:48.796
Hey you.

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:58.339
Just wanted to say
thank you really.

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.780
I don't know if I'm
pregnant yet but,

01:17:59.804 --> 01:18:01.906
I've got two more chances.

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:09.985
I hope you're okay
with all of that.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:14.756
I'll let you know either way.

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.376
Forget this one.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.177
We pride ourselves on
our sporting excellence,

01:18:37.201 --> 01:18:39.980
which means they don't
care whether they can

01:18:39.981 --> 01:18:41.215
read or write or not,

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.150
it's whether they
can kick a football.

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:43.451
Go to the Stiles School,

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:46.220
learn how to be the football.

01:18:46.221 --> 01:18:48.181
You should put yourself
on as many waiting lists

01:18:48.205 --> 01:18:49.023
as you can.

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.984
Yeah, well I've worked
out the sort of timeline.

01:18:51.008 --> 01:18:51.842
A what?

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.527
A timeline.

01:18:53.528 --> 01:18:55.196
You mean like planning ahead?

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:57.933
Awe, our little
girl is grown up.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.067
You know, tonight

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:02.036
you can sit at the big
table with the adults.

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:03.471
Oh, ha ha ha.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:04.306
Very funny.

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:05.806
Hang on, hang on.

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:07.241
Aren't we getting in front
of ourselves a bit here?

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.482
Unless there's something you're
not telling us Christine.

01:19:09.506 --> 01:19:12.008
No, the verdict's still out.

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:17.619
Mikki, Chris, kitchen.

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:30.664
So, it's been long enough.

01:19:30.665 --> 01:19:32.466
Have the test.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:33.735
Yeah.

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.571
Okay.

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:39.440
So I'm scared.

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.641
Look, just find out.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:42.009
And if not this time,

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.011
there's always Mr. Freezer.

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.514
Thanks to Mikki.

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:48.669
Oh, I can't take all the credit,

01:19:48.693 --> 01:19:51.796
syringes and condoms
were in your bag.

01:19:53.955 --> 01:19:55.189
My bag.

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:56.390
Yeah.

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.025
Those condoms
came out of my bag?

01:19:58.026 --> 01:19:59.126
Yeah?

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.395
But they had.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.329
Pregnancy test,

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:35.163
Three,

01:20:35.163 --> 01:20:36.163
Please.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.954
Everything alright ladies.

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.555
Piss off.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.891
It's all good.

01:21:13.368 --> 01:21:15.303
Ugh, I can't do this.
