00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Welcome to The...

00:25.800 --> 00:28.800
Welcome home, Mr. Kline.

01:06.100 --> 01:09.100
Oops. Did you get some on you, Dave?

01:09.100 --> 01:13.100
Didn't want you to get fined.
Just trying to be neighborly.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.200
Got to be up to code.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.200
Shroeder's out there painting our mailbox!

01:36.200 --> 01:39.800
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm going to paint the whole damn house pink.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.800
- Dave.
- Forget about the mailbox, huh?

01:41.800 --> 01:45.100
I'm going to make this whole damn place
look like you won it selling cosmetics.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.800
How about that?
That'll show these Nazis.

01:47.800 --> 01:51.400
Honey, would you just calm down.
Rules are rules.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.300
They're repainting our mailbox because it's
"Desert Sienna" instead of "Desert Sage".

01:56.300 --> 02:01.000
- I mean, this guy is a freakin' weirdo.
- Hon... what's that package?

02:01.300 --> 02:05.000
I don't know.
It doesn't say who sent it.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.400
Tasteful.

02:20.400 --> 02:24.200
Boy, the neighbors would really hate that.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.400
Honey... What is it?

03:00.200 --> 03:01.800
Stay here.

03:55.200 --> 03:58.000
Dave?
Honey?!

04:58.700 --> 05:01.600
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

05:22.300 --> 05:24.800
Take a look at this.

05:25.900 --> 05:30.300
Honey, what do you think?
Is this place us or what?

05:30.300 --> 05:35.400
You must be the Petries.
Hi. Welcome. Welcome to The Falls.

05:35.700 --> 05:37.200
I'm Rob...

05:37.200 --> 05:40.800
- ...and this is my lovely wife, Laura.
- Rob and Laura Petrie.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.900
We pronounce it "Pee-trie," actually.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.500
Like the dish.

05:45.500 --> 05:50.100
Well, it's so nice to meet you.
I'm Pat Verlander. I live six doors down.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.200
- I'm the neighborhood welcome wagon.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance, Pat.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.700
I really must say, it's already ten after 5:00.
I don't think you're going to make it.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.600
- I'm sorry?
- The 6 o'clock cutoff?

06:00.600 --> 06:04.900
All move-ins are required
to be completed by 6 PM.

06:04.900 --> 06:10.000
It's in the CC&Rs.
It's one of our rules.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.200
- The photos did not do it justice.
- Guys, fast, fast now. Come on.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.500
- The previous owners left it so clean.
- What do you do for a living Mr... Petrie?

06:25.500 --> 06:28.100
- That's right, isn't it?
- Yeah, I, uh...

06:28.100 --> 06:33.500
I work mostly at home which is great for
Laura because she gets me all to herself.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.500
This place really is
immaculate, Pat. I, uh, ...

06:38.500 --> 06:40.900
...I wouldn't mind sending a thank-you
note to the previous owners.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.500
Th-that's sweet.
Um... Good.

06:54.900 --> 06:58.500
Okay, move it, people.
Come on.

07:06.100 --> 07:08.800
- Rob and Laura Petrie.
- Yes.
- "Pee-trie."

07:08.800 --> 07:11.200
Win Shroeder, next-door neighbor.
Welcome, welcome.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.200
Hi, Win.
Nice to meet you.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.600
Now, don't you folks worry.
We'll have you moved in before 6:00.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.900
- Time?!
- 5:19.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.300
Uh... pardon me, neighbor.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.000
Thanks.
Oh, thank you.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.300
Thanks. Thank you.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.300
Thank you.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.600
Excuse me!

07:34.300 --> 07:37.700
- I'll get that. It's okay.
- No. No, don't be silly. It's heavy. I got it.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.800
- Oh, no. I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.
- Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike, it's okay.

07:46.800 --> 07:52.200
- It's okay, Mike. Go help Gordy.
- Send me any bills. I'm... I'm sorry.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.400
I'm Cami Shroeder, by the way.
Win's wife.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.800
Nice to meet you.
I'm Laura.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.900
- Where's this go?
- Uh, you can put that in the driveway.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.700
Whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on.
Let's... let's talk. Um...

08:05.700 --> 08:09.400
A b-ball fan, huh? Shooting hoops...
That's, um, that's not good.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.100
That's definitely going to stand
out in your front yard over there.

08:12.100 --> 08:16.600
- Stand out, Win?
- Well, as in, uh... not be aesthetically pleasing...

08:16.600 --> 08:19.000
...to the eye.

08:19.300 --> 08:22.500
But, hey, you know, maybe you can get
special dispensation from Mr. Gogolak, ...

08:22.500 --> 08:25.900
...president of our Homeowner's Association.
I'd take it up with him.

08:25.900 --> 08:30.800
But in the meantime, um...
let's keep that in the garage.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.900
- Just... put it in the garage.
- Okay.

08:34.900 --> 08:39.600
Let's finish getting you folks moved in.
Let's go, people. Let's move! Move!

08:50.900 --> 08:54.700
Oh, yeah. Nothing weird
going on around here.

08:54.700 --> 08:58.700
Hey... ooh, wait a minute. You didn't
let me carry you over the threshold.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.700
- You ready?
- Let's get it on, honey.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.700
All right, then.

09:17.700 --> 09:23.600
Thanks to our friendly neighbors there
will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.700
Not that it makes much difference. This place
is so clean you could build computer chips.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.900
Okay.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.900
6:01 p.m., February 24.

09:37.900 --> 09:43.800
Agents Scully and Mulder in the former
home of David and Nancy Kline...

09:43.800 --> 09:48.500
...who disappeared without a trace last July.
The Klines were the third...

09:48.500 --> 09:54.800
...such couple to disappear since
this neighborhood was built in 1991.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.300
All were apparently stable professional people...

09:59.300 --> 10:04.800
...with no history of violence,
domestic discord or mental illness...

10:04.800 --> 10:10.800
...and it took a family member or employee
to realize that they were gone...

10:10.800 --> 10:14.700
...including their cars and a few personal items.

10:14.700 --> 10:18.400
What local police found in
each case was nothing...

10:18.400 --> 10:21.200
Just impeccably-manicured homes and...

10:21.200 --> 10:25.800
...a community of neighbors who professed
total ignorance that anyone had disappeared.

10:25.800 --> 10:30.500
That's pretty surprising considering how
nutty this bunch is about being neighborly.

10:30.500 --> 10:37.000
The local police department were at a
dead end so they turned to the FBI.

10:37.000 --> 10:42.300
AD Skinner, in assigning us this case,
thought a fruitful approach...

10:42.300 --> 10:48.300
...to the investigation would be if we went
undercover posing as prospective home buyers...

10:48.300 --> 10:52.900
...as this planned community
would seem to hide a dark, ...

10:52.900 --> 10:56.400
...possibly murderous conspiracy of silence.

10:56.400 --> 10:59.400
You want to make
that honeymoon video now?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.500
- Rob and Laura Petrie?
- "Pee-trie".

11:02.500 --> 11:06.300
Mulder, if we ever go undercover again
I get to choose the names, okay?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.000
Fine.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.200
- This tells me that you're not taking this seriously.
- I'm taking it seriously.

11:11.200 --> 11:13.100
I just don't understand why we're on it.

11:13.100 --> 11:16.000
It's our first catch back on the X-Files.
This isn't an X-File.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.100
Sure it is. It's unexplained.
What do you want, aliens? Tractor beams?

11:24.100 --> 11:28.000
Admit it, you just want to play house.

11:28.400 --> 11:32.400
Woman, get back in here
and make me a sandwich!

11:37.200 --> 11:39.600
Did I not make myself clear?

11:44.400 --> 11:48.600
Hi. Well, you didn't need to do that.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.400
Oh, please.
I have more dishes than I need.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.300
I just usually use one and then... wash it.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.200
Uh...

11:57.200 --> 12:00.700
- I'm... uh, Mike Raskub, by the way.
- Hi.

12:00.700 --> 12:06.500
Big Mike, for obvious reasons.
I just live the next street over.

12:06.500 --> 12:10.000
That's a caduceus.
Are you a doctor, Mike?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.900
No, a vet. Veterinarian.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.100
If you folks are thinking about
getting a dog or any pet...

12:16.100 --> 12:18.500
...I'd be happy to check it
out for you, no charge.

12:18.500 --> 12:23.700
Just, uh... you're not allowed to have over 16
pounds of pet. That's one of the CC&Rs.

12:23.700 --> 12:27.000
Mighty nice of you, Mike. I, uh... gosh,
with all this hospitality, ...

12:27.000 --> 12:30.200
...I can't believe the Klines ever left.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.900
That, uh... that was their name, wasn't it?
The, uh, the Klines?

12:33.900 --> 12:35.600
I have to go.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.100
Mulder...

12:46.100 --> 12:49.500
The name... is Rob.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.500
What you got there?

12:57.600 --> 13:01.600
Looks like whoever cleaned
this place maybe missed a spot.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.600
That look like blood to you?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.800
How'd it get way up there?

13:15.300 --> 13:19.400
I, uh... didn't really learn
much about them.

13:19.400 --> 13:24.100
He just said he works at home,
which tells me she's got money.

13:24.100 --> 13:30.900
- Well... seemed nice. Cute couple.
- Mmm, very cute. Uh, they're a nice couple.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.200
What do you think, Gene?

13:33.200 --> 13:36.300
Ladies, my compliments to the chef.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.500
Cami? Sissy?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.800
These Petries, are they going to play ball?

13:54.800 --> 13:58.100
"Pee-tries."
Uh, so far, so good.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.000
I'm keeping my eye on them.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.300
Um... Mr. Gogolak...

14:04.300 --> 14:12.200
Don't you think that, uh... maybe this
time it would be better if we told them?

14:12.300 --> 14:15.400
Mike... you and I have
been through this before.

14:15.400 --> 14:20.400
- We... we don't know yet if we can trust them.
- It's just that...

14:20.700 --> 14:25.300
There are so many... so many rules.

14:25.300 --> 14:29.100
I think that maybe they would be able
to keep up with them better...

14:29.100 --> 14:34.000
...if they knew what happened if they don't.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.800
It's the neighborly thing to do.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.400
I really think we should do this.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.900
Son... Godspeed.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.500
Thank you.

14:57.500 --> 15:02.800
- Um... can I, uh, use your...?
- Second door to the left.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.300
There's Glade under the sink.

15:08.500 --> 15:12.900
Gordy, how about you go make sure he finds it.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.800
- Gene? I can talk him out of this.
- Win.

15:24.800 --> 15:31.600
The boy's a weak link and a strong
chain can't survive with a weak link.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.700
...is instinctive and necessary for survival.

15:47.700 --> 15:52.400
Failure to conform within the tribal
structure can often prove lethal.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.700
When group elders suspect such
an outcast within their midst...

15:56.700 --> 16:00.900
...tribal members gather in a
circle to perform a ritual chant...

16:00.900 --> 16:05.600
...in the belief that this will
expose the unwitting conduit of evil.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.700
The chanters eventually settle on
the so-called misfit and he or she...

16:08.700 --> 16:10.700
Oh, no.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.100
No...

16:44.100 --> 16:47.000
No, I fixed it!
I fixed it!

17:00.800 --> 17:02.500
Morning.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.800
Oh! Oh, Rob, Laura.
I'm so sorry.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.800
So, good morning.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.000
So how was your first night?
Peaceful?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.700
Oh, it was wonderful. We just spooned up
and fell asleep like little baby cats.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.900
- Isn't that right, Honeybunch?
- That's right, Poopyhead.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.900
Win, are we in the right place?
I thought this was Big Mike's house.

17:19.900 --> 17:24.700
Yeah... Yeah. I'm just helping out.
Mike had to leave town on business.

17:24.700 --> 17:29.700
What kind of business?
I thought he was a veterinarian.

17:29.700 --> 17:34.900
Veterinarian business, I guess.
I just know he's gone weeks at a time.

17:34.900 --> 17:38.000
- I'll just leave this here then.
- Let me take those.

17:38.000 --> 17:42.600
Just... tidier-looking than
leaving them on the front porch.

17:43.100 --> 17:47.000
- Be more aesthetically pleasing, huh?
- Exactly.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.900
Say, would you two like to join
Cami and me for dinner this evening?

17:49.900 --> 17:53.800
- About 6:00? We eat early.
- That sounds great. Thanks.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.300
Great.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.100
Oh, Win, uh, you mentioned, uh...

18:02.100 --> 18:05.400
...that I could talk to someone about
putting up my basketball hoop?

18:05.400 --> 18:09.500
Who was that again?
Mr. Gogolak, was it?

18:09.500 --> 18:15.700
All right, then, let's see. Basketball
hoop and backboard. Portable.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.000
Nope, I'm sorry.
It's not allowed.

18:20.000 --> 18:25.100
- You're kidding?
- I'm afraid not. Rules are rules.

18:25.100 --> 18:27.700
It may not sound like anything,
a simple basketball hoop, ...

18:27.700 --> 18:31.800
...but from there, it's just a few short
steps to spinning daisy reflectors...

18:31.800 --> 18:36.900
- ...and a bass boat in the driveway.
- In other words, anarchy.

18:36.900 --> 18:42.700
It may sound tough but ours
is a system that works.

18:42.700 --> 18:50.600
That's why The Falls is one of the top-ranked
planned communities in all of California.

18:50.600 --> 18:56.300
Most of our homeowners have
been here since day one.

18:56.300 --> 19:03.000
I love the decor here, Mr. Gogolak.
Is it, um... Occidental?

19:03.000 --> 19:08.700
Well, it's, uh, Nepalese and Tibetan, mostly.
I go there twice a year on business.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.100
I run Pier 9 Imports.

19:11.100 --> 19:14.500
I can get you a great deal on rattan
furniture if you're interested.

19:14.500 --> 19:21.200
Indoor only. Outdoor use is
prohibited by our... CC&Rs.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.400
SCROEDER RESIDENCE
6:37 PM

19:26.100 --> 19:29.200
Uh-uh, Scruffy.
Go on, now.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.000
Sweetheart? Did you use the
dolphin-safe tuna this time?

19:33.000 --> 19:34.900
Dolphin-safe all the way, Honey.

19:34.900 --> 19:38.500
- We always use the dolphin-safe.
- You've got to love those dolphins...

19:38.500 --> 19:42.000
...although they're pretty tasty, too.

19:45.300 --> 19:48.600
So... Where'd you two meet?

19:49.300 --> 19:54.700
- Actually, it was at a UFO conference.
- Flying saucers? Interesting.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.900
Wouldn't have thought you
folks would have been into that.

19:58.900 --> 20:02.000
Well, it's not me so much as Laura.
She's quite the New-Ager.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.600
I mean, she's into those magnetic bracelets
and crystals and mood rings, what have you.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.900
I mean, God bless her she's
a sucker for all that stuff.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.500
Well, I wouldn't have
guessed that, would you?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.900
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.700
You know, Win, uh, when you, uh...

20:19.700 --> 20:24.300
...when you told me this morning that
Big Mike was out of town on business...

20:24.300 --> 20:27.100
I don't think that's true.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.100
You don't?

20:30.300 --> 20:34.300
- No, 'cause we called his office, didn't we, Honey?
- We did.
- Yeah.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.000
We're thinking about getting a dog...

20:38.000 --> 20:40.600
...so we wanted to call him and ask
him his advice, whatever, and...

20:40.600 --> 20:43.400
...see if maybe his office had a forwarding
number and they said, you know...

20:43.400 --> 20:47.000
- That he wasn't there. They didn't know where he was.
- Yeah.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.000
Do you know where he is, Win?

20:54.200 --> 20:57.500
Really couldn't tell you.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.700
It's got to be something really freaky-deaky, hunh?
I mean, for him to lie about it like that?

21:00.700 --> 21:04.200
Maybe he's got some wild secret life going on.

21:06.500 --> 21:11.000
But every community has its dark
underbelly don't you think?

21:11.600 --> 21:14.900
We don't have any underbelly.

21:16.100 --> 21:19.900
As far as I'm concerned this
community is the American Dream.

21:19.900 --> 21:23.100
Um... I'm sorry.

21:23.100 --> 21:27.300
I, um... realize that it's
past time that I walk Scruffy.

21:27.300 --> 21:31.000
- Would you like some company?
- Yeah.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.800
So is this the American dream?

21:47.800 --> 21:49.600
This place?

21:49.600 --> 21:52.400
Oh, uh...

21:52.400 --> 21:59.000
Nice neighborhood, you know... just a lot of
people who want the best for their families.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.500
So it's just not your dream.

22:05.200 --> 22:08.100
You know, Cami, I-I've
noticed that you've, uh, ...

22:08.100 --> 22:13.600
...walked us past Mike's house... twice.
Are you worried about him?

22:13.600 --> 22:17.400
No... I don't really know what you mean.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.700
Scruffy!
Scruffy, come here!

22:20.700 --> 22:22.300
Scruffy, no!

22:22.300 --> 22:23.200
Scruffy!

22:23.200 --> 22:26.000
Scruffy, come out here!
Scruffy!

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Scruffy, come out of there.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.700
Let me take a look.

22:34.700 --> 22:36.400
Do you see him?

22:53.900 --> 22:57.700
Scruffy, Scruffy, it's okay, it's okay.
I got you. I got you. Oh...

22:57.700 --> 23:00.400
- What you got there?
- Deep breath.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.300
That's a close one, huh? Yeah?

23:04.000 --> 23:07.900
Let me wipe that off.
That's a good boy.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.500
Okay, let's get you home.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.000
Come on.

23:27.800 --> 23:30.200
- All right, Lieutenant.
- Here. Caduceus.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
Thank you.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.100
Local PD came up blank on...

23:39.100 --> 23:41.000
Mike Raskub.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.500
No activity on his credit cards.
No sighting of his '97 Mercury Villager.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, there's no sign of him in his house.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.500
I didn't see him in the storm drain, either.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.500
I take it he's dead, Scully.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.400
Laura.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.200
Win Shroeder?

23:58.200 --> 24:00.900
Mmm, maybe Win cleaning up.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.100
Cleaning up for who?

24:04.000 --> 24:05.700
- I don't know.
- Mulder, speaking of cleaning up, ...

24:05.700 --> 24:09.400
...whoever taught you how to
squeeze a tube of toothpaste?

24:10.300 --> 24:12.100
Hey, what do we know about this stuff?

24:12.100 --> 24:15.800
I'm driving down to San Diego
tomorrow and have it analyzed.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.500
- All right.
- Third warning. Toilet seat.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.800
Why kill Big Mike?

24:27.200 --> 24:32.900
What's missing here is intent.
What would be the motive?

24:33.500 --> 24:36.800
Compulsive neatness, or a lack thereof.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.300
Have you noticed how everybody
around here is...

24:38.300 --> 24:41.800
...is obsessed with the neighborhood
rules and the CC&Rs?

24:41.800 --> 24:44.300
You know what?
You fit in really well here.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.000
And you don't.

24:46.000 --> 24:51.400
Well, anyway, tomorrow I got a, uh, a
surefire way of testing out my theory.

24:54.500 --> 24:57.300
Come on, Laura, you know...

24:57.300 --> 24:59.000
We're married now.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.900
Scully, Mulder.
Good night.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.800
The thrill is gone.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.000
Bring it on.

27:43.500 --> 27:46.500
"Be like the others... before it gets dark."

28:01.000 --> 28:02.300
- Stay here.
- Stop him, Win.

28:02.300 --> 28:04.300
- Stay here!
- Stop him!

28:10.000 --> 28:12.800
Hey, Win.
Want to play "horse"?

28:14.400 --> 28:17.100
- What the hell are you doing?
- What am *I* doing?

28:17.700 --> 28:19.700
- What are *you* doing?
- Damn it, Rob, get off of it!

28:19.700 --> 28:22.600
- Help me get this thing inside.
- Why? What's going to happen if we don't?

28:22.600 --> 28:26.000
Fine. That's the way you want it?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.400
- You were warned.
- Warned about what?

28:38.400 --> 28:41.500
No! No!

28:42.100 --> 28:43.800
Please!

28:47.400 --> 28:48.900
Stop!

29:04.200 --> 29:07.400
Cami... you all right?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.600
Mulder?

30:07.600 --> 30:10.100
Mulder, is that you?

31:40.700 --> 31:43.700
Sorry, Mulder.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.600
Somebody was in the house.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.700
Tidying up. Whoever it was,
they put away my basketball hoop.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.800
Somebody's looking out after us, Scully,
which may not be a bad thing.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.100
- What do you mean?
- I got a look at that thing that's been scaring...

31:55.100 --> 31:59.600
...everybody and I take it back.
This is an X-File.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.600
How's Cami?

32:16.200 --> 32:19.100
What did we do wrong, Gene?

32:19.100 --> 32:21.800
Was our welcome mat not to your liking?

32:21.800 --> 32:25.800
Did I coil my garden hose clockwise
instead of counterclockwise?

32:25.800 --> 32:29.300
Hold the phone, now.

32:29.500 --> 32:33.800
- Are you saying that I had something to do with this?
- Who else?

32:33.800 --> 32:37.300
The exact same thing, the thing you had me
do to Mike. Who else would do that?

32:37.300 --> 32:41.800
Son, you'll want to take a deep breath...

32:41.800 --> 32:45.400
...and rethink that theory.

32:51.800 --> 32:55.200
It's your next-door neighbor, Win.

32:55.200 --> 32:59.600
He's a rabble-rouser.
He's trouble with a capital "T."

32:59.600 --> 33:03.500
And you and I both know it only
takes one rotten apple...

33:03.500 --> 33:06.500
...to spoil the whole bunch.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.800
Here we go.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.500
Yeah... I'm guessing there's
one of these in every yard.

33:22.500 --> 33:26.700
I think this is how this
thing travels-- where it lives.

33:27.000 --> 33:29.300
In the ground.

33:29.300 --> 33:33.300
This huge creature you think you saw?

33:37.400 --> 33:42.500
Look, Mulder, huge creatures aside
do you care to hear what I think?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.200
Always.

33:51.100 --> 33:54.300
These are the lab results
from the San Diego PD.

33:54.300 --> 33:59.100
First of all, the stuff that we found on the fan
blade, the dried blood and scalp hairs?

33:59.100 --> 34:03.500
It's neither. The blood is predominantly
ketchup and brake fluid...

34:03.500 --> 34:06.900
...and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush...

34:06.900 --> 34:13.000
...and the same goes for the sample
we found on the dog's muzzle.

34:13.000 --> 34:18.600
It's coffee grounds, eggshells and motor
oil with about 50 other constituents...

34:18.600 --> 34:23.500
...with a little mercurochrome for color.
In other words, Mulder, it's garbage.

34:23.500 --> 34:28.699
Which makes perfect sense because this entire
neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.800
A landfill?

34:30.800 --> 34:35.500
We found this stuff everywhere because it is
everywhere. It's just beneath the topsoil...

34:35.500 --> 34:41.900
...and that protrusion in the front yard may
occur from the venting of methane gas...

34:41.900 --> 34:46.600
But... Mulder, I don't see how any of this has to do
with the disappearances that we're investigating.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.300
- It does. Somehow, it's one and the same. The Klines?
- Yeah?

34:50.300 --> 34:53.199
What if they're still here.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.100
You mean buried in the yard?

34:56.100 --> 35:01.100
Well, once we start a forensic
excavation, our cover's blown.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.700
What in God's name are you doing?!

35:15.500 --> 35:17.600
- God...!
- Putting in a pool.

35:17.600 --> 35:21.100
In the front yard?!
Wh-wh-what are you, insane?

35:21.100 --> 35:24.700
Have you even looked at the CC&Rs?
You-you can't just put in a swimming pool!

35:24.700 --> 35:27.700
It's not a swimming pool.
It's a reflecting pool.

35:27.700 --> 35:29.800
I checked the rules.

35:29.800 --> 35:33.500
There's no rule against putting
in a reflecting pool.

35:33.500 --> 35:36.700
It's very tranquil.
You'd like it.

35:45.900 --> 35:49.200
Let him dig his own grave.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.800
Hey.

36:10.800 --> 36:12.200
Mulder.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.600
The Klines aren't down there.

36:19.100 --> 36:22.600
Maybe it's time you called it a night.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.200
Tasteful, isn't it?

36:53.600 --> 36:55.700
Gogolak.

36:55.700 --> 36:59.600
- Hey, can you get an excavation team out here?
- Yeah.
- We need to dig deeper.

36:59.600 --> 37:03.100
- Where are you going?
- To price some rattan furniture.

37:51.100 --> 37:58.000
Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully.
I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace.

37:59.700 --> 38:02.700
No, not tomorrow. Tonight.

38:03.900 --> 38:06.800
I'm sorry.
Can I call you back?

38:16.200 --> 38:17.700
Jeez.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.200
Oh, God.

38:33.800 --> 38:38.300
It's come for you, Laura.
You can't make a noise.

38:40.300 --> 38:42.700
Mike.

38:42.700 --> 38:45.500
- What happened to you?
- You have to get out of here.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.700
Why?

38:48.900 --> 38:52.700
Wait a minute, who's downstairs?
Mike...

38:52.900 --> 38:58.700
- Who did this to you?
- The ubermenscher. It's our fault.

38:59.900 --> 39:05.100
The original homeowners, we asked
for it and now we can't stop it.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.700
Stop what, Mike?

39:11.200 --> 39:16.500
I tried to give it Shroeder. You know,
tit-for-tat. Just like Shroeder did for me.

39:16.500 --> 39:21.000
Mike, listen, settle down. Okay.
Just give me my gun. I'm a federal agent...

39:21.000 --> 39:25.500
The ubermenscher wants you, Laura.
Your husband, he's broken way too many rules.

39:25.500 --> 39:29.500
I've been hiding in the sewer.
I tried to warn him.

39:31.700 --> 39:34.900
Mike, just give me the gun. Give me...

40:00.700 --> 40:02.800
FBI? What did I do?

40:02.800 --> 40:04.500
Let's start with the Klines.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.800
You're responsible for them being
in little pieces in my front yard.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.100
You gave them that lawn ornament.
The guy with the axe?

40:10.100 --> 40:11.600
- Whirligig.
- Yeah, whirligig.

40:11.600 --> 40:16.500
It's tacky enough to break your rules and your
CCRs, tacky enough to mark the Klines for death.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.800
And won't that sound good in a court of law?

40:18.800 --> 40:24.800
When the judge asks you who killed the Klines
what exactly are you going to tell him?

40:26.800 --> 40:29.700
A tulpa.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.000
It's a Tibetan thought-form.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
It's a living, breathing creature willed into existence
by someone who possesses that ability ...

40:38.000 --> 40:43.500
An ability I think you picked up on your
whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East.

40:43.500 --> 40:49.600
Why'd you do it? I mean, is it so damn important
for everybody to have the same color mailbox?

40:49.600 --> 40:53.300
It's important that people fit in.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.800
But you didn't know exactly what
you were getting into, did you?

40:55.800 --> 41:01.400
I mean, you can summon its existence, but... you
can give it life, but you can't control it.

41:01.400 --> 41:06.000
- The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way.
- Son, my lawyers are going to...

41:06.000 --> 41:11.800
...make you sound so stupid that not only will
I never see the inside of a jail cell...

41:11.800 --> 41:16.600
...but you'll be signing all your
paychecks straight to me.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.600
Gene?

41:46.400 --> 41:48.700
Win.

41:49.100 --> 41:53.000
You've got two FBI agents
living next door to you.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.900
Cheer up.
It's not for long.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.100
Scully?

42:07.600 --> 42:09.600
Scully?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.800
Scully?

42:29.900 --> 42:31.600
Mulder?

42:31.600 --> 42:33.700
- Scully?
- Mulder?

42:33.700 --> 42:35.600
Scully, hang on.

42:38.100 --> 42:41.100
Come here.
Help me with this.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.400
Win, come here.

42:44.100 --> 42:45.800
Win...!

42:46.300 --> 42:49.100
Win, wait a minute.
No. No.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.900
He deserves what he gets.

42:57.500 --> 43:01.100
Mulder, it was here.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.300
Mulder!

44:04.600 --> 44:07.900
Several residents of The Falls have now
come forward to blame the deaths...

44:07.900 --> 44:12.100
...in the neighborhood on Home Owner
Association President Gene Gogolak.

44:12.100 --> 44:15.400
These same residents deny Agent Mulder's
allegation that they were...

44:15.400 --> 44:19.600
...in some sense all responsible for
the demise of Gogolak himself...

44:19.600 --> 44:22.900
...claiming ignorance as to
what actually killed him.

44:22.900 --> 44:26.000
It would seem the code of silence that
hid the sins of this community...

44:26.000 --> 44:31.700
...has not only survived but, in its creator,
claimed a final victim.

44:31.700 --> 44:34.500
Meanwhile, The Falls at Arcadia
has been named one of...

44:34.500 --> 44:39.700
...the top planned communities in
California for the sixth year running.
