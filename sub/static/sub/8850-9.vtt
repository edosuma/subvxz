00:08.642 --> 00:12.080
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.
DON'T RUN AWAY LIKE THAT.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.714
EZRA!

00:13.747 --> 00:15.483
A KNIFE DOESN'T SCARE ME,
YOUNG MAN.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.451
HOLD STILL.
- [chuckles]

00:20.121 --> 00:23.257

BOY A GOOD WHUPPIN' WON'T FIX.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.758
- YEAH.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.694
THINK WE'LL START
WITH A HAIRCUT FIRST.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.797
- MM-HMM.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.764
- LET'S GET TO IT.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.467
- YEAH.

00:33.501 --> 00:36.137
A WOMAN LIKE THAT GOOD
WITH SCISSORS AND A BIBLE?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.771
YOU OUGHT TO MARRY HER UP,
MR. BOHANNON,

00:37.805 --> 00:40.108
BEFORE MISS RUTH FIND HER
SOME OTHER LOWLIFE

00:40.141 --> 00:42.643
FANCY BELT-WEARING HUCKSTER

00:42.676 --> 00:44.445
- YOU CALLIN' ME
A FANCY LOWLIFE

00:44.478 --> 00:45.746
BELT-WEARING HUCKSTER,
PSALMS?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.381
- [chuckles]

00:49.817 --> 00:52.120
UH, NO, SIR, MR. BOHANNON.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.687
- ALL ANYBODY NEEDS TO BE
CONCERNED WITH TODAY

00:53.721 --> 00:55.656
IS MAKING CHEYENNE
BY TOMORROW.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.758
- YES, SIR, MR. BOHANNON.

01:01.295 --> 01:04.432
- ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL,
LISTEN UP!

01:04.465 --> 01:08.136
THAT THERE DOT ON THE HORIZON
IS CHEYENNE!

01:08.169 --> 01:11.172
I PROMISED GENERAL GRANT
HISSELF...

01:11.205 --> 01:14.442
THAT WE'D MAKE IT THERE
BY TOMORROW AT SUNSET.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.278
IT GIVES US TWO DAYS
TO LAY 5 MILE OF TRACK.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.680
- MR. BOHANNON,
SPEAKING FOR THE IRISH,

01:19.713 --> 01:21.649
ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,
BUT TOMORROW'S SUNDAY.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.451
IT'S THE LORD'S DAY,
NOT A WORK DAY.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.852
- YEAH. YEAH.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

01:24.885 --> 01:28.289
- EVEN THE LORD
MAKES EXCEPTIONS, MR. QUINN.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.823
AND SACRIFICES.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.692
IN FACT, THE ONLY THING
HE DON'T MAKE

01:31.725 --> 01:33.661
IS THE EXTRA MONEY
I'M GONNA PUT IN YOUR POCKETS

01:33.694 --> 01:35.129
YOU GET US TO CHEYENNE
ON SCHEDULE.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.130
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

01:36.164 --> 01:39.167
- THIS RIGHT HERE...

01:39.200 --> 01:41.302
IS THE REST OF MY STOCK.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.836
I'M CASHING IT IN.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.538
SPREADING IT AROUND.
WHO WANTS A PIECE?

01:44.572 --> 01:46.674
all: YEAH.
- I WANT A PIECE.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.776
- WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S NO SIN
TO WORK ON THE LORD'S DAY.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.444
LONG AS WE DON'T
MAKE A HABIT OF IT.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.912
- AND MY CREW
WILL TAKE A PIECE OF THAT.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.647
- WORK BE OUR TICKET
TO HEAVEN.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.316
WE'LL RIDE THIS TRAIN
AND THAT STOCK

01:55.349 --> 01:56.784
ALL THE WAY TO CHEYENNE.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.323
- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
HELL AND BACK.

02:02.356 --> 02:05.193
INDIANS, RAIN, DROUGHT...

02:05.226 --> 02:08.829
CHOLERA.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.732
YOU MEN HAVE DONE
A HELL OF A JOB.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.834
I'M PROUD OF ALL OF Y'ALL.

02:18.906 --> 02:21.342
NOW...

02:21.375 --> 02:23.611

02:56.277 --> 02:57.745
[whistle blowing]

02:59.280 --> 03:02.350
[distant train whistle]

03:13.761 --> 03:16.264
- GOOD GOD,
HE'S GOING TO DO IT.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.798
- WHO IS?

03:17.831 --> 03:18.899
- BOHANNON!

03:18.932 --> 03:20.801
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.870
TOMORROW,
HE'LL BE RIGHT HERE,

03:22.903 --> 03:25.773
LAYING TRACKS IN MY TOWN.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.408
PENNIES ON MY EYES.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.810
- OUR TOWN.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.646
YOU KEEP LEAVING THAT
RATHER IMPORTANT PART OUT.

03:35.349 --> 03:39.453
HMM. HOW DID YOU SLEEP
LAST NIGHT, MR. DURANT?

03:39.487 --> 03:42.890
THOSE GOOSE DOWN MATTRESSES,
THEY COST A FORTUNE.

03:42.923 --> 03:44.825
[spyglass snaps shut]

03:46.494 --> 03:49.363
WHAT?

03:49.397 --> 03:51.632
- YOU SELL CATTLE
TO BOHANNON.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.402
YOU LEND ME MONEY
TO BUILD OUR TOWN.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.837
YOU BUILD A HOTEL
ON THE BEST LOT IN CHEYENNE

03:56.870 --> 04:00.441
AND CHARGE ME
FULL FARE TO RENT A ROOM.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.711
NOW, IF I DIDN'T
KNOW BETTER,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.314
I MIGHT THINK YOU WERE PLAYING
BOTH ENDS AGAINST THE MIDDLE,

04:06.347 --> 04:07.481
MRS. PALMER.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.950
- HMM.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.452
THANK YOU, ABIGAIL.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.887
- [clears throat]

04:13.921 --> 04:16.724
- OFTEN, YOUR INTERESTS
ALIGN WITH MINE.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.058
OCCASIONALLY, THEY DON'T.

04:18.091 --> 04:22.630
- [laughs]
YOUR INTERESTS ALIGN WITH MINE?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.465
I THINK
YOU GOT IT BACKWARDS.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.400
[chuckling]

04:28.369 --> 04:30.871
MMM.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.506
QUAIL?

04:32.540 --> 04:35.443
- DOVE.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.479
THE FRENCH CALL IT DETENTE.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.780
IT'S WHAT YOU AND BOHANNON
BETTER REACH

04:39.813 --> 04:41.382
BEFORE HE REACHES CHEYENNE.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.351
- MAKE PEACE WITH BOHANNON?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.719
TO WHAT END?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.321
- YOU PROMISED ME
CHEYENNE WOULD BE

04:47.355 --> 04:49.623
THE MOST IMPORTANT
RAILROAD CITY IN AMERICA.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.991
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT

04:51.024 --> 04:54.995
WITHOUT THE COOPERATION
OF THE RAILROAD?

04:55.028 --> 04:57.998
- YOU ARE AN EXASPERATING WOMAN,
MRS. PALMER.

04:58.031 --> 05:02.770
- WHY? BECAUSE I TALK LIKE
A BLUNT-TALKIN' MAN?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.439
SEND BOHANNON A TELEGRAM.

05:05.473 --> 05:06.907
INVITE HIM TO LUNCH.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.009
TODAY.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.079
WORK IT OUT.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.882
- NOTHING IS THAT EASY
WITH BOHANNON.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.518
- I AM NOT SURE
HE'S THE PROBLEM.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.502
- THAT'S HIM.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.085
- LOT OF GUNS DOWN THERE.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.754
- ALL THE GUNS IN THE WORLD

05:53.787 --> 05:56.123
WILL NOT PROTECT
CULLEN BOHANNON.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.441
[western folk music]

06:13.474 --> 06:21.549
*

06:47.040 --> 06:48.476
- RUTH.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.612
RUTH.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.981
- MR. BOHANNON.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.649
THIS JUST CAME FOR YOU.

06:59.653 --> 07:02.556
- SURE YOU
WROTE THIS DOWN RIGHT?

07:02.590 --> 07:04.592
- YES, SIR.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.460
- THANK YOU, LUKE.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.064
RUTH.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.941
WHERE'S RUTH AT?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.178
HEY, SHE GAVE YOU
A HAIRCUT.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.647
LOOKS GOOD.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.994
RUTH?

07:43.096 --> 07:46.767
- I'VE KEPT YOU OUT OF YOUR BED
LONG ENOUGH, MR. BOHANNON.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.802
I'LL BE ON THE NOON TRAIN
TO OMAHA.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.671
THERE'S AN ORPHANAGE
IN COUNCIL BLUFFS.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.906
I CAN TAKE EZRA--
- RUTH...

07:56.143 --> 07:57.911
STOP IT.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.091
- I'M SORRY, BUT IF A TENANT
OF CHRIST'S TEACHINGS

08:11.124 --> 08:15.996
IS SELFLESSNESS, THEN
I HAVE BEEN A POOR DISCIPLE.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.265
- SEAN MCGINNIS
WAS A TROUBLED SOUL.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.801
HIS BROTHER RELIEVED HIM
OF HIS TROUBLES.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.970
NOW, THAT WEREN'T
THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOURS.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.539
- SEAN CAME TO ME
TO UNBURDEN HIMSELF.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.675
HE CAME SEEKING SOLACE.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.043
AND...

08:32.312 --> 08:34.114
AND I DENIED HIM.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.323
PERHAPS I WOULD DO WELL

08:43.356 --> 08:47.094
TO SPEND SOME TIME
AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.973
- THE MEN NEED YOU HERE, RUTH.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.614
- I HAVE MADE NO DIFFERENCE

09:06.647 --> 09:08.115
IN THEIR LIVES.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.620
- WELL, YOU'VE GIVEN ME
COMFORT.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.588
AND YOU'VE GIVEN ME
HELL TOO.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.989
[chuckles]

09:16.023 --> 09:18.626
IN EQUAL PARTS,
ACCORDING TO WHAT I DESERVE.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.128
AND I AIN'T THE ONLY ONE.

09:23.964 --> 09:27.100
- DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY,
MR. BOHANNON?

09:33.106 --> 09:37.611
- HELL ON WHEELS JUST NEEDS
A GOOD PREACHER, RUTH.

09:37.645 --> 09:39.279
AND YOU ARE.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.682
YOU ARE A GOOD PREACHER.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.654
TOMORROW'S SUNDAY.

09:46.687 --> 09:50.023
THE MEN EXPECT
TO GET PREACHED TO.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.059
THEY EXPECT YOU
TO DO THE PREACHING.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.794
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

09:55.829 --> 09:57.665
COME ON, BOY.
GET YOUR HAT.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.332
WE'RE GOING TO CHEYENNE.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.741
YOU HAVE A SEAT.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.343
YOU STAY RIGHT THERE TOO.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.113
MICKEY.
- YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.416
CHIEF OF POLICE OVER THERE
IS FULL AS A GYPSY'S BRA,

10:16.449 --> 10:18.952
AND I'M ALMOST POSITIVE
THAT WALLACE

10:18.986 --> 10:20.754
IS DEALING
OFF THE BOTTOM OF THE DECK.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.958
- THANK YOU.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.696
- TAKE TWO.

10:41.208 --> 10:44.277
- TAKE YOUR DAMN SCALP AND GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.718
OH, YOU CAN LEAVE THAT.
- THAT'S MY MONEY.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.253
- NOT ANYMORE, IT AIN'T.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.822
- UM...

11:05.432 --> 11:08.101
- YOU BEST GIVE ME THAT.
IT COST ME $1.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.471
- AGH!

11:11.504 --> 11:13.874
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.343
UGH!

11:16.376 --> 11:17.410
[sniffles]

11:17.444 --> 11:21.381
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.851
THAT'S A TELEGRAM.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.753
FROM DURANT.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.889
ASKING ME TO COME
TO CHEYENNE.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.924
- WHAT FOR?

11:30.958 --> 11:33.060
- IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SAY HE'S SURRENDERING.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.795
HE KNOWS WE'RE GONNA BE
IN CHEYENNE TOMORROW

11:34.828 --> 11:35.763
AND WANTS TO BROKER A DEAL.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.165
KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

11:38.198 --> 11:40.133
HEY.
[knocks on table]

11:42.202 --> 11:45.038
WE WON THE DAMN WAR,
DAMN IT.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.443
- AIN'T NONE OF US OUT HERE
NEVER WON NOTHIN'.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.413
AND NEVER WILL.

11:53.446 --> 11:57.017
OTHERWISE, WE WOULDN'T
BE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.992
- QUIT YOUR DAMN BITCHIN'.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.426
YOU'RE COMIN' TO CHEYENNE.
LET'S GO.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.829
- WELL, WHAT YOU
NEED ME FOR?

12:08.862 --> 12:11.832
- VICTORY NEEDS AN AUDIENCE,
AND YOU IS HE.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.166
COME ON, MY FRIEND.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.238
[sighs]

12:25.846 --> 12:29.216

12:32.385 --> 12:34.187
[coughing]

12:44.497 --> 12:46.033
WHERE MY MONEY AT?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.902
- PUT YOUR HAT ON.
YOU MIGHT FIND IT.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.404
UH-UH.
COME ON.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.855
- I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU'D COME.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.256
- FORGIVE ME.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.224
IF YOU'RE PRAYING,
I CAN COME BACK.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.462
- HOW WILL YOU TELL IT?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.466
"CAIN AND ABEL"?

13:21.301 --> 13:25.005
"FALLEN WOMAN PASTOR
BRINGS MURDER INTO HER CHURCH"?

13:27.207 --> 13:30.010
- IS THAT HOW
YOU SEE YOURSELF...

13:30.043 --> 13:32.479
A FALLEN WOMAN PASTOR?

13:41.488 --> 13:45.058
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
ABOUT THE NEWSPAPER.

13:56.603 --> 14:02.342
- DO YOU EVER WONDER HOW WE CAME
TO BE IN THIS FORSAKEN PLACE?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.610
- [sighs]

14:03.643 --> 14:06.880
WELL...

14:06.914 --> 14:09.616
IF I BELIEVED IN GOD,

14:09.649 --> 14:13.520
WHICH...I DON'T...

14:13.553 --> 14:18.125
I WOULD SAY
IT'S FOR MY SINS.

14:18.158 --> 14:21.328
- I HAVE JUST ENOUGH FAITH
TO CONDEMN ME

14:21.361 --> 14:24.331
FOR THE SINS I'VE COMMITTED
SINCE I ARRIVED HERE.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.136
- WHAT SINS?

14:33.506 --> 14:36.476
- I'VE BEEN PRAYING
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.678
- I-IT ISN'T...

14:38.711 --> 14:42.115
A SIN TO PRAY
FOR UNDERSTANDING, IS IT?

14:42.149 --> 14:44.484
- OH, WE CAN'T KNOW
GOD'S WILL.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.990
- SO...

14:50.023 --> 14:51.959
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE YOU?

14:51.992 --> 14:54.661
WILL YOU...GO BACK EAST?

14:59.132 --> 15:01.969
- MR. BOHANNON HAS...

15:02.002 --> 15:05.438
ASKED ME TO STAY
WITH THE RAILROAD.

15:05.472 --> 15:09.042
- SO...PERHAPS HE'S THE ANSWER
TO YOUR PRAYERS.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.611
[chuckles]

15:11.644 --> 15:13.346
[both laugh]

15:13.380 --> 15:15.582
- A MAN WITH THE MARK OF CAIN.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.952
[chuckles]

15:18.986 --> 15:21.454
THAT WOULD BE IRONIC.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.431
- YOU HAVE FEELINGS FOR HIM.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.599
DON'T YOU?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.147
- WHY WE GOING TO CHEYENNE?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.619
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
- NO, YOU AIN'T.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.188
WHEN YOU TELL ME?
- WOULD YOU JUST SHUT--

15:55.222 --> 15:57.124
SHUT UP.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.226
YOU'RE MAKIN' MY HEAD HURT.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.399
HO.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.272
- WHAT WE DOING?

16:12.305 --> 16:15.208
- MEN COMING UP BEHIND US.
DON'T LOOK BACK.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.179
- WHO THEY?

16:19.212 --> 16:21.114
- TOLD YOU
NOT TO LOOK BACK.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.083
- WHO IS IT?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.618
- DAMN IT, ELAM!

16:25.652 --> 16:28.455
COME ON.
GET UP.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.157
GET BACK ON.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.663
GET THE BOY TO CHEYENNE,
FAST AND STRAIGHT.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.997
HYAH!

16:39.699 --> 16:41.434
[gunshot]

16:44.237 --> 16:46.039
[rifle cocks]

16:46.073 --> 16:47.474
[gunshot]

16:48.641 --> 16:49.742
- AAH!

16:49.776 --> 16:51.478
[horse whinnies]

16:51.511 --> 16:53.213
[gunshot]
- HYAH!

16:55.182 --> 17:00.019
[gunshots]

17:12.265 --> 17:15.102
- GET THAT CHAIR!
[gunshots]

17:15.135 --> 17:17.070
[glass breaks]
COME ON!

17:17.104 --> 17:19.739
[bullets ricocheting]

17:19.772 --> 17:21.308
DON'T MOVE.

17:21.341 --> 17:24.644
- BOHANNON!
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME IS GOING ON?

17:24.677 --> 17:25.778
- I'D KEEP MY HEAD DOWN
IF I WAS YOU!

17:25.812 --> 17:27.847
- OOH!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.216
- GO!
[gunshot]

17:29.249 --> 17:31.118
UGH!

17:31.151 --> 17:32.285
- HYAH! HYAH!
- HYAH!

17:42.195 --> 17:44.731
- WHO THE HELL'S OUT THERE?
- NO IDEA.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.299
[gunfire]

17:48.201 --> 17:49.702
- WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.804
- I'M DRUNK.
- CHRIST!

17:51.838 --> 17:53.573
- YEP.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.708
GET THAT BOY UPSTAIRS!
- YOU GET HIM UPSTAIRS.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.245
THIS IS MY HOTEL, AND THOSE
WINDOWS COST A FORTUNE!

17:58.278 --> 18:00.680
OTIS!
WHERE'S MY YELLOW BOY?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.252
[gunshots, glass shattering]

18:05.285 --> 18:06.686
- YOU A GOOD SHOT?
- I CAN TAKE THE EAR

18:06.719 --> 18:09.289
OFF A RABBIT AT 200 YARDS--
LEFT OR RIGHT.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.191
- OTIS, YOU GOT ANY COFFEE?
- IN THE BACK.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.793
- BRING IT!
HERE.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.164
ANYBODY COMES THROUGH
THAT DOOR OR THAT DOOR,

18:17.197 --> 18:19.332
YOU SHOOT 'EM.
COME ON.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.301
YOU KNOW HOW TO USE
THAT THING?

18:21.334 --> 18:22.802
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

18:22.835 --> 18:29.108
[gunfire]

18:33.180 --> 18:34.381
STAY RIGHT THERE.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.788
[grunts]

18:41.821 --> 18:44.157
[gunshots]

18:44.191 --> 18:48.328
[men shouting]

18:48.361 --> 18:50.163
SHIT!

18:50.197 --> 18:52.199
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

18:52.232 --> 18:53.866
NO MATTER WHAT YOU HEAR,

18:53.900 --> 18:56.236
YOU DON'T LEAVE
TILL I COME BACK, YOU GOT ME?

18:56.269 --> 18:58.438
[gunfire continues]
ALL RIGHT.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.475
I AIN'T LEAVIN' YOU, SON.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.583
NOW, YOU DRINK THAT.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.852
THEM MEN COME AT US
ON THE WAY OVER HERE.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.287
AFTER YOUR INVITE.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.823
- NOT EVERYTHING BAD
THAT HAPPENS TO YOU

19:16.856 --> 19:18.658
IS MY FAULT, BOHANNON.
- MOSTLY IT IS.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.693
- I TOLD YOU
THERE WAS A RANGE WAR COMING.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.529
NOT ALL MY NEIGHBORS
ARE HAPPY WITH MY DECISION

19:22.562 --> 19:24.231
TO SELL LIVESTOCK
TO THE RAILROAD.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.665
OR BUILD THIS TOWN.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.267
- NO, THEY COME AFTER ME.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.370
- I DON'T THINK IS A FIRST
FOR YOU, BOHANNON.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.872
- WHOEVER THEY IS,
THEY GOT US OUTNUMBERED

19:32.905 --> 19:34.841
AND OUTGUNNED.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.975
WE GONNA NEED A PLAN.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.277
[gunshot, glass shatters]

19:37.310 --> 19:39.246
- OTIS, YOU GOT
ANY FOOD, WATER?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.380
- NOT MUCH.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.681
- SHIT.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.616
WE GOT WOMEN AND CHILDREN
IN HERE.

19:43.650 --> 19:46.386
ALL THEY GOT TO DO
IS WAIT US OUT.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.388
- THIS TOWN GOT A TELEGRAPH
OFFICE, DON'T IT?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.923
- YES. UP THE STREET.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.260
- MAJOR BENDIX
ONLY A FEW HOURS FROM HERE.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.627
- YOU GO OUT THERE,
YOU'LL BE DEAD

19:54.661 --> 19:56.229
LONG BEFORE
THE CAVALRY GETS HERE.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.431
- THAT IS A DISTINCT
POSSIBILITY.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.871
YOU KEEP 'EM OFF ME TILL
I GET ACROSS THE STREET,

20:04.904 --> 20:06.973
WE MIGHT MAKE IT.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.376
- YOU GOT THAT BOY UPSTAIRS.

20:09.409 --> 20:10.410
I'LL GO.

20:10.443 --> 20:11.778
- WHAT?

20:11.811 --> 20:13.480
- YOU WANT ME TO COVER YOU?

20:16.449 --> 20:18.451
DRUNK OR SOBER,
YOU A BETTER SHOT THAN ME.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.990
GOTTA BE ME THAT GO.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.291
- BOHANNON!

21:00.960 --> 21:02.895
- YOU'RE SURROUNDED!

21:04.364 --> 21:05.932
- COME OUT!

21:05.965 --> 21:07.967
GUNS DOWN!

21:08.000 --> 21:11.037
YOU HAVE MY WORD,
NOBODY'LL BE HURT.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.441
- ALL WE WANT IS BOHANNON!

21:20.813 --> 21:22.349
- YOU AIN'T BELIEVIN' HIM.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.884
- AIN'T NO SENSE
IN ALL OF US GETTING KILLED.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.419
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

21:26.453 --> 21:27.954
I'LL GO TALK TO THEM,

21:27.987 --> 21:31.023
SEE WHAT THEY WANT WITH YOU,
NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.625
- OH!

21:36.028 --> 21:38.064
- WHAT NOW?

21:38.097 --> 21:40.800
- OTIS, HOW MUCH WHISKEY
YOU GOT?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.311
- AH!

21:59.552 --> 22:01.053
[gunshot]

22:01.087 --> 22:03.823
[horses whinny]

22:03.856 --> 22:05.425
[gunshots]

22:24.143 --> 22:25.578
- AAH!

22:29.015 --> 22:30.583
[gunshot]
- AAH!

22:37.624 --> 22:38.791
- DAMN IT.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.610
AAH!

23:02.549 --> 23:06.085
[panting]

23:06.118 --> 23:07.454
- WE TOO LATE.

23:07.487 --> 23:10.389
[glass shatters]
- [grunts]

23:25.505 --> 23:28.608
- OWW.
TELL YOU WHAT.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.977
THIS RAILROAD BUSINESS
IS FUNNER THAN SHIT.

23:31.010 --> 23:31.911
[grunts]

23:34.681 --> 23:37.550
- IT BEAT PICKING COTTON
FROM CAN SEE TO CAN'T SEE.

23:37.584 --> 23:41.621
- FIRST YEAR OF THE WAR,
I THOUGHT...

23:41.654 --> 23:44.156
"BEST DAMN THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME."

23:44.190 --> 23:45.925
I HATED FARMING.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.760
RATHER BE ANYWHERE

23:47.794 --> 23:50.029
THAN ASS-DEEP
IN MISSISSIPPI MUD...

23:50.062 --> 23:52.164
RUNNING BEHIND
A MULE ALL DAY.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.601
- HOW LONG BEFORE
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

23:54.634 --> 23:56.469
- [grunts]

23:56.503 --> 23:58.871
JUST DID.

24:01.841 --> 24:03.743
- THAT LITTLE BOY
WAITING FOR YOU.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.580
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN
OUT THERE,

24:07.614 --> 24:09.482
YOU MAKE IT TO THAT HOTEL,
YOU HEAR?

24:09.516 --> 24:11.484
- I DON'T...

24:11.518 --> 24:13.886
YOU FINISH THAT ROAD.

24:18.224 --> 24:21.027
AND, ELAM...
[cocks gun]

24:25.565 --> 24:27.700
I NEVER FREED MY SLAVES.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.539
- I ALWAYS FIGURED
YOU WAS LYING ABOUT THAT.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.143
- READY?
- MM-HMM.

24:50.189 --> 24:53.259
- ELAM.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.261
- I KNOW.

25:17.149 --> 25:18.117
- AH!

25:34.166 --> 25:36.068
[thud]

25:43.710 --> 25:45.144
- PSST.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.011
- [muffled grunting]

26:22.014 --> 26:24.383
- AH!
- AH! THEY STORMED THE PLACE.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.618
- WHERE THE BOY AT?

26:25.652 --> 26:27.854
- WHA--THEY TOOK HIM.

26:30.189 --> 26:33.092
- THEY TOOK THAT BOY
TO GET AT YOU.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.226
- HEY.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.028
YOU MIGHT NEED THIS.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.772
- I'M GONNA TAKE THE BACK.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.051
[rifle clicks]

27:11.330 --> 27:13.065
[gunshot]

27:14.266 --> 27:18.404
[gunshots]

27:51.904 --> 27:54.140
- LET THE BOY GO.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.108
- SOON AS YOU DROP
YOUR GUN BELT.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.350
- BOY AIN'T GOT NOTHIN'
TO DO WITH THIS.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.155
WHAT YOU WANT?

28:09.188 --> 28:11.323
- YOU FOR THE BOY.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.894
- ALL RIGHT.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.428
LET HIM GO.

28:16.462 --> 28:17.864
- YOU DROP YOUR GUN BELT

28:17.897 --> 28:19.465
AND YOU COME OUT
WHERE I CAN SEE YOU.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.498
- MR. FERGUSON'S
BACK ALONG THE WAY.

28:52.531 --> 28:53.833
YOU GO WITH HIM
BACK TO THE HOTEL.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.267
GO ON.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.203
EZRA.

28:57.236 --> 29:00.907
YOU LISTEN TO MISS RUTH,
YOU HEAR ME?

29:00.940 --> 29:02.374
GO ON.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.508
- THEY SAY
WHY THEY TOOK HIM?

29:36.542 --> 29:39.045
- I THINK IT'S THE MORMONS
FOR HIM TAKING THE WORKERS.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.080
- HUNTINGTON WARNED HIM
ABOUT THAT.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.449
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT FOOL ENOUGH
TO GO AFTER HIM.

29:43.482 --> 29:45.251
- I'M GONNA DO
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.920
BOHANNON SAID
KEEP BUILDING THE RAILROAD,

29:47.954 --> 29:49.288
WITH OR WITHOUT HIM.

29:49.321 --> 29:51.858
I AIM IT TO BE WITH HIM.
- MR. FERGUSON.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.926
MR. FERGUSON!

29:53.960 --> 29:56.528
GOING AFTER HIM IS SUICIDE.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.197
LOOK AROUND YOU.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.267
DO YOU WANT TO FACE
THOSE MEN AGAIN, ALONE?

30:01.300 --> 30:03.870
- I'M GONNA KEEP MY WORD
TO BOHANNON.

30:03.903 --> 30:07.406
THEN I'M BUSTING HIM FREE.
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

30:11.911 --> 30:15.381
[bells ringing]

30:15.414 --> 30:18.417
[steam engine chugging]

30:18.450 --> 30:20.819
[train whistle blows]

30:30.662 --> 30:31.898
- UH, MISS ELLISON.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.900
- YES?

30:33.933 --> 30:35.334
- UH...

30:35.367 --> 30:37.636
MRS. TOOLE WILL BE
LEAVING US, I'M AFRAID.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.238
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

30:39.271 --> 30:41.573
- WELL, THE WOMAN'S A WHORE,
MISS ELLISON.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.913
- MRS. TOOLE IS NOT A WHORE.

30:46.946 --> 30:48.414
AND EVEN IF SHE WERE,
I EXPECT THAT

30:48.447 --> 30:49.916
TO BE AS LITTLE CONCERN
TO YOU

30:49.949 --> 30:52.551
AS YOUR PREVIOUS MISADVENTURES
ARE TO ME.

30:52.584 --> 30:56.055
- I RUN A RESPECTABLE
ESTABLISHMENT.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.390
- PRIOR TO BECOMING
MR. MORTIMER RAMSEY,

30:58.424 --> 31:01.961
PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL,
YOU LIVED IN OMAHA?

31:01.994 --> 31:05.965
CALLING YOURSELF...
AH, DR. HENRY WHITFORD.

31:05.998 --> 31:07.934
UNTIL THE DEATHS
OF THREE PATIENTS

31:07.967 --> 31:11.303
HASTENED A NAME CHANGE
AND A MOVE WEST.

31:11.337 --> 31:12.939
- CLEARLY, YOU ARE MISTAKEN.

31:12.972 --> 31:14.373
- THE DEATHS WERE ATTRIBUTED
TO AN OVERDOSE

31:14.406 --> 31:16.175
OF "PERPETUAL SUNSHINE"...

31:16.208 --> 31:18.477
A MIRACLE ELIXIR
YOU WIDELY PRESCRIBED,

31:18.510 --> 31:20.346
CLAIMING IT WOULD CURE
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING,

31:20.379 --> 31:23.916
WHICH I GUESS, TECHNICALLY,
DEATH DOES, DOESN'T IT?

31:26.052 --> 31:27.653
I'M A NEWSPAPER WOMAN,
MR. RAMSEY.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.922
PEOPLE TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS,
THAT, AND THE OTHER.

31:29.956 --> 31:33.359
NOW, AS FOR MY GUEST,

31:33.392 --> 31:34.660
SHE WILL BE STAYING ON

31:34.693 --> 31:37.463
UNTIL SHE FINDS OTHER,
MORE SUITABLE, LODGINGS.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.498
ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT?

31:39.531 --> 31:42.068
- YES.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.070
- LOVELY.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.980
- I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE
NO TROUBLE.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.515
- NO TROUBLE AT ALL, EVA.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.551
LISTEN, AND IF THAT MAN
GIVES YOU ANY MORE GUFF,

31:59.585 --> 32:01.620
YOU JUST TALK TO ME, OKAY?

32:01.653 --> 32:03.422
LET ME KNOW.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.502
- WHY YOU DOING THIS
FOR ME?

32:16.535 --> 32:19.038
- YOU'RE A GOOD WOMAN, EVA.

32:19.071 --> 32:22.975
YOU'VE JUST HAD
SOME TOUGH LUCK.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.058
- THANK YOU.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.577
- UH...

33:00.512 --> 33:03.115
- IT'S WHAT YOU WANT,
AIN'T IT?

33:05.484 --> 33:09.388
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

33:09.421 --> 33:12.491
- WELL, I SEEN THE WAY
YOU LOOK AT ME.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.164
- EVA...

33:21.200 --> 33:24.236
THAT'S NOT WHY
I ASKED YOU TO STAY HERE.

33:26.138 --> 33:29.608
- WELL, I THOUGHT...

33:29.641 --> 33:32.611
- WHAT?

33:32.644 --> 33:35.614
THAT--THAT YOU'RE NOT WORTHY
OF MY FRIENDSHIP?

33:37.783 --> 33:40.552
EVA, YOU ARE.

33:47.493 --> 33:51.763
- I DON'T ACCEPT
NO CHARITY, SO...

33:51.797 --> 33:54.566
- EVA...STAY.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.502
PLEASE.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.684
- [snorts]

34:19.858 --> 34:22.060
[groans softly]

34:32.604 --> 34:33.505
[grunts]

34:37.676 --> 34:39.578
[coughs]

34:57.163 --> 35:00.266
OH, SHIT.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.169
- I TOLD YOU...
YOU OWE ME A LIFE

35:03.202 --> 35:05.237
FOR THE ONE
YOU TOOK FROM ME.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.821
- IT WAS ME THAT KILLED
MY BROTHER, RUTH.

35:55.854 --> 35:59.825
IT WAS HIM THAT CAUSED IT.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.794
AND IT WILL BE ME
THAT HAS TO ANSWER FOR IT

36:02.828 --> 36:04.896
WHEN THE TIME COMES,
NOT YOU.

36:08.700 --> 36:13.372
- WHAT DID THAT DETECTIVE
THINK SEAN HAD DONE IN BOSTON?

36:13.405 --> 36:16.742
STRANGLE SOMEONE?

36:16.775 --> 36:19.911
A WOMAN?

36:19.945 --> 36:22.981
YOU LED HIM TO BELIEVE
SEAN WAS ABOUT TO DO THAT TO ME.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.750
- ON MY MOTHER'S SOUL.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.818
I THOUGHT HE WAS.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.427
- WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.632
THE TRUTH.

36:41.933 --> 36:44.636
WHAT HE WAS.

36:44.670 --> 36:50.676
- THE TRUTH IS,
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.912
I HAVE FAITH

36:53.945 --> 36:56.648
ONE DAY YOU'LL SEE THAT.

37:10.329 --> 37:12.931
[overlapping chatter]

37:12.964 --> 37:14.666
- LISTEN UP, GENTLEMEN.

37:16.302 --> 37:18.036
CULLEN BOHANNON'S GONE.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.873
[indistinct chatter]

37:21.907 --> 37:23.975
A GANG OF RIDERS
CAUGHT US UP IN CHEYENNE

37:24.009 --> 37:26.044
AND TOOK HIM.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.746
I DON'T KNOW WHERE,

37:27.779 --> 37:30.316
OR IF HE'LL BE BACK.

37:30.349 --> 37:32.318
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE ALIVE.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.385
- RAISE A POSSE,
MR. FERGUSON.

37:33.419 --> 37:35.754
WE'LL FIND HIM!
all: YEAH!

37:35.787 --> 37:39.291
- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE
NO MEN TO NO POSSE, NOT TODAY.

37:39.325 --> 37:42.060
- ARE YOU SAYING
WE LEAVE HIM OUT THERE TO DIE?

37:42.093 --> 37:44.330
- WE GET TO CHEYENNE FIRST.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.998
THEN WE LOOK FOR HIM.

37:47.032 --> 37:51.703
BOHANNON HISSELF SAY
THIS RAILROAD COME FIRST.

37:51.737 --> 37:54.039
AND AIN'T

37:54.072 --> 37:57.075
EXCEPT FOR HIM
AND WHAT HE DONE

37:57.108 --> 38:00.812
AND HOW HE DONE IT.

38:00.846 --> 38:03.014
WE WOULDN'T BE THIS FAR...

38:03.048 --> 38:04.683
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM.

38:04.716 --> 38:08.487
- NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
- I KNOW THAT.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.656
WE DON'T GET TO CHEYENNE
BY TOMORROW NIGHT,

38:10.689 --> 38:13.024
DURANT GONNA COME BACK
AND RUN THIS RAILROAD.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.493
[all murmur]

38:14.526 --> 38:18.096
WHETHER BOHANNON
HERE OR NOT.

38:18.129 --> 38:20.966
NOW, BOHANNON WORKED ME
TO THE BONE.

38:20.999 --> 38:24.636
BUT HE WORKED HISSELF
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.738
HE AIN'T NEVER GIVE
NONE OF US NOTHING

38:26.772 --> 38:28.374
THAT WE AIN'T EARNED.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.509
- THAT'S RIGHT!
- AND WHEN HE DID,

38:30.542 --> 38:31.810
HE STAND BY IT.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.414
[murmurs of agreement]

38:35.447 --> 38:39.651
BOHANNON CALLED ME A NIGGER...

38:39.685 --> 38:42.454
BUT HE AIN'T NEVER
TREAT ME LIKE ONE.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.796
DURANT A MAN

38:50.829 --> 38:53.899
AND STOLE AND DISRESPECTED

[murmurs of agreement]

38:55.567 --> 38:57.803
NOW, WE GONNA GET THIS TRACK
