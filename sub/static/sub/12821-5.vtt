<i>Previously on "Zero Hour"...</i>

00:04.711 --> 00:06.649
They're breaking in.

00:06.683 --> 00:08.116
We know who might have her.

00:08.151 --> 00:10.018
He's the highest end mercenary
in the world.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.821
It's about a clock. 1938.
The church appointed

00:12.855 --> 00:14.089
12 new apostles.

00:14.123 --> 00:16.358
They call themselves
The Shepherds.

00:16.393 --> 00:20.261
Their mission is to protect
the holiest of relics.

00:20.296 --> 00:22.630
Who are they protecting from?

00:22.665 --> 00:24.532
Tell her just a matter of time

00:24.567 --> 00:26.467
till she has the object
she seeks.

00:26.502 --> 00:27.969
I have the first three clocks.

00:29.505 --> 00:32.941
Vincent has never kept
a hostage alive, so why Laila?

00:32.975 --> 00:35.943
We did it.

00:35.977 --> 00:37.344
- Where is she?
- What are you doing

00:37.378 --> 00:38.445
my husband's flight...

00:38.479 --> 00:40.214
one passenger was supposed
to be on it.

00:40.248 --> 00:43.317
- What does that have to do with Laila?
- She lied!

00:43.351 --> 00:44.985
The clocks... where are they?

<i>Life comes full cycle...</i>
<i>First death, then birth.</i>

01:10.343 --> 01:13.578
Mankind once feared
the locust.

01:13.579 --> 01:16.248
He believed they were
the hand of God,

01:16.282 --> 01:20.018
decimating crops
to punish our sins.

01:20.053 --> 01:23.421
But then we learned
we can't control sin

01:23.456 --> 01:25.156
or Grace,

01:25.190 --> 01:28.592
but we <i>can</i> control science.

01:28.627 --> 01:31.528
Today, science destroys
the locust,

01:31.563 --> 01:33.397
crops thrive,

01:33.431 --> 01:35.066
and now...

01:35.100 --> 01:38.335
God's power resides
in the hand of man,

01:38.370 --> 01:42.372
so we must <i>use</i> that power.

01:49.747 --> 01:51.815
I'm glad you understand.

01:53.885 --> 01:55.851
Now what did you hear
from White Vincent?

01:55.886 --> 01:57.386
Has he found the clock?

02:13.435 --> 02:15.369
My wife lied to me
for five years,

02:15.404 --> 02:17.672
and I never suspected,
not once.

02:17.706 --> 02:19.607
She faked
her entire life story.

02:19.641 --> 02:21.609
Her accent, her passport.

02:21.643 --> 02:24.779
Now all I know about that girl
is that her name is Anna Massey,

02:24.814 --> 02:28.081
and that for some reason,
she's after those clocks.

02:28.116 --> 02:30.050
Because the clocks don't just
lead to <i>some</i> relic.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.618
They lead to <i>the</i> relic.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.855
They're a map to
the true cross of Christ.

02:34.889 --> 02:36.356
True cross.

02:36.390 --> 02:39.092
That explains why people have
risked so much for so long

02:39.127 --> 02:40.828
to protect those 12 clocks.

02:40.862 --> 02:43.396
But I just can't understand
why Laila would betray Hank.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.697
She was trained for this.

02:44.731 --> 02:45.731
Trained by who?

02:45.765 --> 02:46.933
That's what I intend
to find out

02:46.967 --> 02:48.500
as soon as I catch her.

02:48.535 --> 02:50.102
No, no. The last time you were
talking like this,

02:50.137 --> 02:52.604
you were talking about
White Vincent, a terrorist.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.506
What do you think Laila is?

02:54.541 --> 02:57.576
I think that she stepped off
my husband's flight...

02:57.610 --> 02:59.678
Right before
Vincent blew off the wings.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.247
You think she's responsible.

03:02.281 --> 03:04.282
I think she was informed.

03:04.317 --> 03:07.585
And to me,
that's the same thing.

03:07.619 --> 03:09.154
This is absolutely massive.

03:09.188 --> 03:12.190
The greatest conspiracy
in all of human history.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.825
Hank just had his life
torn apart,

03:13.860 --> 03:16.193
and all you can do is geek out
over conspiracy theories?

03:16.228 --> 03:20.197
It's not a theory. The cross is
real. People are killing for it.

03:20.232 --> 03:21.365
But why?

03:21.399 --> 03:23.700
Maybe it was for faith
or profit.

03:23.735 --> 03:25.669
You must have some guess.

03:25.703 --> 03:27.037
I don't.

03:27.072 --> 03:29.006
Because the woman I married?

03:29.040 --> 03:31.908
Never existed.

03:57.633 --> 03:59.501
What are you hiding?

03:59.535 --> 04:01.270
Huh?

04:01.304 --> 04:02.704
What are you hiding?

04:07.009 --> 04:08.709
Aah!

04:08.743 --> 04:10.878
Uhh!

04:27.761 --> 04:31.965
<i>The bird feeder's empty. I'm</i>
<i>gonna make up the sugar water.</i>

04:31.999 --> 04:35.335
<i>It's delicate.</i>
<i>You need just the right mix.</i>

04:54.420 --> 04:55.887
Clever.

04:55.922 --> 04:59.390
The Shepherds... they're the ones
who protect the cross, right?

04:59.425 --> 05:02.193
And the great Pyrates...
They're hunting for it.

05:02.227 --> 05:04.763
So Laila's gotta be working
for one of 'em.

05:04.797 --> 05:07.666
We don't know that. She could've
ran for other reasons.

05:07.700 --> 05:08.999
Like what?

05:09.033 --> 05:10.601
I don't know.
Like protecting Hank.

05:10.635 --> 05:12.470
Maybe she thought
Vincent was getting close.

05:12.504 --> 05:14.071
Or she was
working <i>with</i> Vincent.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.474
You're an idiot.
Laila would never do that.

05:16.508 --> 05:18.308
You keep acting like
you know her.

05:18.343 --> 05:21.144
She pretended to be your friend...

05:21.179 --> 05:22.880
and mine,

05:22.914 --> 05:25.582
and the greatest wife
a guy could ever ask for.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.217
But she obviously wasn't
any of those things.

05:28.251 --> 05:29.652
Both of you, that's enough.

05:29.687 --> 05:33.990
You want answers? Let's do what
we always do, okay?

05:34.024 --> 05:36.759
Look for the truth.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.895
Here. I found this
in our house.

05:41.031 --> 05:42.898
Laila hid it in a bird feeder.

05:42.932 --> 05:44.666
Looks like it's
a hundred years old.

05:44.701 --> 05:45.901
Any idea what it opens?

05:45.935 --> 05:47.303
I have no idea, okay?

05:47.337 --> 05:49.838
I have to search the clock
store, the storage space...

05:49.873 --> 05:52.341
- Everything from Laila's life.
- I get it.

05:52.376 --> 05:54.477
We can take care of this.

05:54.511 --> 05:56.412
And find it soon.
If she has those clocks,

05:56.446 --> 05:59.481
we're not the only ones
looking for her.

06:13.528 --> 06:17.597
You are
a very strange little boy.

06:19.567 --> 06:21.902
Do people tell you that often?

06:25.840 --> 06:27.641
Yeah.

06:32.513 --> 06:34.813
This is not acceptable.

06:34.848 --> 06:38.717
Tell her I don't need rest
or replacement.

06:38.752 --> 06:40.486
I will find Laila,

06:40.521 --> 06:43.056
gut her like an elk,

06:43.090 --> 06:44.723
take the clocks.

06:44.758 --> 06:48.760
You see, I do my best work
when I'm angry.

06:53.032 --> 06:54.866
Oh!

06:56.134 --> 06:57.301
Please.

07:01.206 --> 07:04.108
I was shot. Now I'm better.

07:06.278 --> 07:08.913
Remind her

07:08.948 --> 07:12.348
I'm still her best shot
to get Laila.

07:27.064 --> 07:28.965
You wanted
to see me, father?

07:28.999 --> 07:30.666
I did.

07:30.701 --> 07:32.201
You've been with us
almost two years now,

07:32.235 --> 07:34.236
and I hear you're ready
to take your vows.

07:34.270 --> 07:36.238
Yes. I'm ready
to devote my life to God.

07:36.272 --> 07:38.708
And yet, I've heard rumors

07:38.742 --> 07:40.943
about your life
before the church,

07:40.978 --> 07:45.313
that you were...
a drug addict...

07:45.347 --> 07:47.482
a thief.

07:47.516 --> 07:50.085
Is this all true?

07:50.119 --> 07:52.587
I see. So you lied to us.

07:52.622 --> 07:55.890
- Only so that I could join the church.
- Quite skillfully.

07:55.925 --> 07:57.691
Please don't turn your back
on me, father.

07:57.726 --> 07:59.459
I'm not that person anymore,

07:59.494 --> 08:02.730
and I've done everything that
I can to walk in God's light.

08:02.764 --> 08:05.032
<i>Not</i> everything.

08:05.066 --> 08:07.467
Not yet.

08:07.502 --> 08:09.536
Tell me...

08:09.570 --> 08:12.572
Have you heard
of The Shepherds?

08:12.607 --> 08:14.540
Yes.
I've... I've heard stories.

08:14.574 --> 08:17.977
They protect the holiest secrets
of the church.

08:18.012 --> 08:19.578
We...

08:19.613 --> 08:22.649
Do much more than that.

08:22.683 --> 08:25.184
Shepherds defend
the dominion of God on earth,

08:25.218 --> 08:28.220
and we must sometimes...

08:28.255 --> 08:30.255
sin to do it.

08:32.525 --> 08:34.893
You understand this path.

08:34.927 --> 08:38.063
We'd like you
to walk it with us.

08:38.097 --> 08:42.868
That's a most incredible honor,
father, but...

08:42.902 --> 08:45.336
- my vows...
- Are a small faith.

08:45.371 --> 08:50.107
Like a grain of wheat
calling itself bread.

08:50.142 --> 08:53.077
True believers must
sweat and bleed

08:53.111 --> 08:55.146
and sacrifice everything.

08:55.180 --> 08:58.149
In this box...

08:58.183 --> 08:59.784
are symbols of your old life...

08:59.818 --> 09:02.919
Your life as Anna Massey.

09:02.953 --> 09:04.688
As a Shepherd,

09:04.722 --> 09:09.059
you would leave this life,
this name behind forever.

09:11.996 --> 09:14.798
That would be no great loss.

09:14.832 --> 09:17.733
You can choose to be a nun
if you like,

09:17.767 --> 09:20.035
serve the lord in small ways.

09:20.070 --> 09:23.205
Or you can burn this,

09:23.239 --> 09:25.174
join us.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.776
Show true devotion to God.

09:33.116 --> 09:35.683
The choice is yours.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.778
Whoever trained Laila
trained her well.

10:04.812 --> 10:07.747
We're doing a 300-mile
surveillance sweep on her.

10:07.781 --> 10:11.083
She's a ghost.
No sign of her.

10:11.118 --> 10:12.284
But I could've told you that
on the phone,

10:12.318 --> 10:13.619
so tell me why you had to

10:13.653 --> 10:17.489
rush me out here at the crack
of dawn on Sunday morning.

10:17.523 --> 10:19.191
I've been combing through
Laila's life,

10:19.226 --> 10:21.526
trying to find a piece
the didn't fit.

10:21.561 --> 10:23.161
And you found something?

10:23.195 --> 10:27.565
This garden. She volunteered
here 7:00 A.M. every Sunday,

10:27.599 --> 10:28.933
which I thought was
a strange choice

10:28.968 --> 10:31.604
because, you know,
she hates mornings.

10:31.724 --> 10:32.754
We both do.

10:32.972 --> 10:34.773
Let me guess.
You never went.

10:36.042 --> 10:37.875
Nobody has gone near the plot.

10:37.909 --> 10:39.443
Don't stare.

10:39.478 --> 10:43.375
Check your phone. Tie your
shoelaces. Do anything else.

10:48.387 --> 10:51.789
Okay, we got somebody.

11:00.298 --> 11:04.100
He just pocketed something.

11:04.134 --> 11:07.837
Very casually, just follow me.

11:12.141 --> 11:14.109
That's a good crop
you've got there.

11:14.143 --> 11:16.412
Oh, thank you.
It's the moss that...

11:19.849 --> 11:22.784
FBI! Stop!

11:56.183 --> 11:59.084
Stop! FBI!
Hands in the air!

11:59.119 --> 12:02.588
Hank Galliston, you must stop
searching for your wife.

12:02.623 --> 12:05.591
Is Laila safe?

12:05.626 --> 12:08.527
A Shepherd keeps her secrets
until the end.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.763
Do you know where she is?

12:10.797 --> 12:12.298
Yes.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.067
I'm afraid I do.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.139
No!

12:58.444 --> 13:01.044
I found this on the body.

13:01.079 --> 13:03.481
This is Laila's handwriting.

13:03.515 --> 13:06.484
That's it.

13:06.518 --> 13:08.919
She works with the Shepherds.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.689
"352 irrelevant"?

13:11.723 --> 13:13.691
What does that mean? 352?

13:13.725 --> 13:17.627
I don't know.
It meant something to Laila.

13:17.661 --> 13:21.498
It means we're getting closer.
We will find her.

13:23.467 --> 13:26.669
I need to know what
this is all about,
Father Mark.

13:26.704 --> 13:28.838
For thousands of years,
Shepherds have struggled

13:28.873 --> 13:31.673
to protect the cross
from those who covet it...

13:31.708 --> 13:35.110
A group known as the Pyrates.

13:35.144 --> 13:36.912
They've had many covers
through the ages...

13:36.946 --> 13:41.583
Kings, warlords,
captains of industry.

13:41.618 --> 13:46.488
Today, some of them hide
under the guise of philanthropy.

13:46.522 --> 13:48.122
Who could suspect
a good samaritan

13:48.156 --> 13:50.324
or imagine their true goals?

13:50.358 --> 13:51.792
Which are what?

13:51.827 --> 13:54.395
That... is why
we need you, sister.

13:54.429 --> 13:58.032
The Pyrates have a clinic
in South America.

13:58.066 --> 14:01.035
We suspect it's a cover
for an experimental program,

14:01.069 --> 14:03.970
but we need more information.

14:04.005 --> 14:05.672
You have to get close,

14:05.706 --> 14:07.241
gain their trust.

14:07.275 --> 14:10.309
You want me to spy on them?

14:10.344 --> 14:11.710
To... to... to what?

14:11.745 --> 14:14.113
To lie?

14:14.148 --> 14:16.416
Steal? Betray people?

14:18.352 --> 14:20.886
Like I used to.

14:20.921 --> 14:22.155
All your actions are holy now

14:22.189 --> 14:25.191
when they serve a higher cause.

14:38.137 --> 14:40.238
Hey.

14:40.273 --> 14:42.640
Needle in a haystack?

14:42.675 --> 14:44.075
Halfway solved.

14:44.109 --> 14:45.977
You got something?

14:46.011 --> 14:47.411
This little beauty

14:47.446 --> 14:49.814
was made by a company called
Goss Brothers Locksmiths.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.083
Do you see that "GB" engraving?

14:52.117 --> 14:54.052
Our lock will have
the same thing.

14:54.086 --> 14:56.754
That only leaves about
half of New York.

14:58.123 --> 14:59.823
Yeah, I know
it was, like, a century ago.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.725
You're the sixth person
that I've talked to.

15:01.759 --> 15:03.560
I really need...

15:03.595 --> 15:05.629
God, I love New York.

15:05.663 --> 15:07.864
Put down
the phone, get off the computer.

15:07.899 --> 15:09.365
We got a lead.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.434
We realized that if you wanna
find out where someone's going,

15:11.469 --> 15:12.836
find out how they got there.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.770
Arron begged me to look up
Laila's Metrocard records

15:14.805 --> 15:17.372
to find out where
she got off the train.

15:17.407 --> 15:19.609
He can be kind of persuasive
when he tries.

15:19.643 --> 15:21.944
So it looks like
Laila has been taking

15:21.979 --> 15:24.046
a lot of trips to Flatbush.
Any idea why?

15:24.081 --> 15:26.315
There's this Haitian bakery
she used to go to,

15:26.349 --> 15:28.951
to get me these meat pies
that I really liked.

15:28.986 --> 15:31.886
Did she do that three times
a week, every week,

15:31.921 --> 15:34.355
for the last... four years?

15:38.861 --> 15:41.596
There's the Haitian bakery.

15:41.631 --> 15:43.598
This is the epicenter.

15:43.633 --> 15:46.200
Six blocks either direction.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.669
Any building that's old enough,

15:48.703 --> 15:50.904
check to see if they have
Goss Brothers locks.

16:04.618 --> 16:07.654
Uh, ma'am, can we help you
with your groceries?

16:07.688 --> 16:11.390
Uh...
Thank you, young man.

16:11.424 --> 16:12.925
That's... that's very kind
of you.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.794
Oh, no, no. Our pleasure.

16:14.828 --> 16:16.495
Listen, my... my sister, she lives
in this building. Uh-huh.

16:16.530 --> 16:17.964
And she gave me her key,

16:17.998 --> 16:20.032
but I don't know
which apartment she's in.

16:20.066 --> 16:23.535
I wanted to surprise her.
Do... do you recognize her?

16:23.569 --> 16:26.304
Oh, she's the one in... in 2B.

16:26.338 --> 16:28.106
2b? Great.

16:28.141 --> 16:29.340
Thank you.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.281
This is it!

16:36.315 --> 16:37.782
Give me the key.

16:40.186 --> 16:42.153
She's in there.

16:55.567 --> 16:56.868
FBI!

17:08.060 --> 17:09.729
She's not here.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.872
Every single week
that we spent together,

17:20.906 --> 17:24.976
she lied to my face
and came here.

17:25.010 --> 17:26.678
To do what?

17:31.116 --> 17:32.450
To pray.

17:34.619 --> 17:36.787
I don't think you go
to all this trouble

17:36.822 --> 17:38.823
just to chat with God.

18:07.316 --> 18:09.651
Got something!

18:16.926 --> 18:19.728
It's just a bunch
of newspaper clippings

18:19.762 --> 18:21.729
about charity work.

18:21.763 --> 18:23.263
Why would she keep these?

18:23.298 --> 18:25.933
Same reason that she kept this?

18:25.968 --> 18:28.402
Memories from her past?

18:29.805 --> 18:32.507
It's the only personal thing
in here.

18:32.541 --> 18:34.575
Any idea who that is with her?

18:34.610 --> 18:37.577
I've never seen her before
in my life.

18:37.612 --> 18:40.079
We couldn't match her face
to the FBI database.

18:40.114 --> 18:42.281
It just means she never had a mug shot.

18:42.316 --> 18:43.583
But even though
we can't find a "who,"

18:43.618 --> 18:45.619
we might be able
to find a "where."

18:45.653 --> 18:48.722
We've been using this new
spatial matching technology,

18:48.756 --> 18:50.891
and what it does
is it analyzes landmarks,

18:50.925 --> 18:52.058
like the church.

18:52.092 --> 18:55.628
It matches it against
other online photos.

18:55.662 --> 18:58.430
This is
the church of San Pastore

18:58.464 --> 19:00.098
in Asuncion, Paraguay.

19:00.133 --> 19:03.468
Laila never mentioned that,
spending time in Paraguay?

19:03.503 --> 19:06.639
She told me she had never
traveled to South America.

19:06.673 --> 19:10.074
Well, somehow this place
meant something to her.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.809
We need to know why.

19:16.148 --> 19:17.281
Hey, watch it, dirty aussie.

19:17.315 --> 19:18.650
Don't blame me
for your headache.

19:18.684 --> 19:20.217
What are you, like, 90 pounds?

19:20.252 --> 19:21.920
How are you not
so hungover today?

19:21.954 --> 19:24.088
I am. I'm just better
at hiding it.

19:24.122 --> 19:27.290
Well, that's the end of
my drinking days for a while.

19:27.324 --> 19:28.625
Okay.
This is why

19:28.660 --> 19:30.827
I came to South America
in the first place.

19:30.862 --> 19:32.863
You know, to help people.

19:32.897 --> 19:35.165
I mean, you. What is it? You
get this glow about you... oh.

19:35.199 --> 19:37.067
When you talk about
volunteering at the clinic.

19:37.101 --> 19:38.234
That's what I want.

19:38.269 --> 19:39.803
Look, it's... it's hard work,

19:39.837 --> 19:41.804
but it's the best job
in the world.

19:41.838 --> 19:44.941
I'll do my best to get you in,
and you'll do great.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.442
Oh, let's do a photo...
Would you?

19:46.476 --> 19:48.243
With the church before we go.
Great idea.

19:48.278 --> 19:50.112
<i>¿Una foto, por favor?</i>

19:50.146 --> 19:51.447
<i>Gracias.</i>

19:51.481 --> 19:52.949
Um, with the church
in the back and the parrot.

19:54.217 --> 19:55.350
Ah!

19:55.385 --> 19:56.518
All right, with the church.
Okay.

19:56.553 --> 19:58.753
<i>Uno, does, tres.</i>

20:07.295 --> 20:09.563
I called the priest
in Asuncion.

20:09.598 --> 20:11.665
He never saw Laila
at his church,

20:11.700 --> 20:16.503
and he was positive he'd
remember a pretty Australian.

20:16.537 --> 20:18.739
Shot in the dark. Thank you.

20:18.773 --> 20:20.873
A chance to practice
my Spanish.

20:22.710 --> 20:26.378
Something else
I noticed, though.

20:26.413 --> 20:27.880
The girl...

20:27.915 --> 20:29.248
See her bracelet?

20:29.282 --> 20:31.484
She's
a public health volunteer.

20:31.518 --> 20:32.652
Saw them all the time

20:32.686 --> 20:34.520
when I was doing missionary work
in Ghana.

20:36.122 --> 20:37.355
Just got some news.

20:37.389 --> 20:39.958
The D.C. Bureau pulled
video surveillance of Laila.

20:39.993 --> 20:42.127
Footage shows her entering
Dulles International Airport

20:42.161 --> 20:43.729
six hours ago,
then she disappeared.

20:43.763 --> 20:45.731
Rachel, can you bring up

20:45.765 --> 20:48.834
all international flights out
of Dulles in the last six hours?

20:50.970 --> 20:52.369
Looks like seven departures.

20:52.403 --> 20:55.006
Seven flights...

20:55.040 --> 20:57.642
and one straight to
Asuncion, Paraguay.

20:57.676 --> 20:59.777
You think that's a coincidence?

20:59.811 --> 21:03.047
Hank's about to fly
halfway around the world

21:03.081 --> 21:06.350
to find this woman
who we believe is a Shepherd.

21:06.384 --> 21:08.351
Is there any chance
you know her?

21:08.385 --> 21:10.386
I might have given
the wrong impression.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.822
I know about the Shepherds
in a general sense,

21:12.857 --> 21:15.158
but... I've never met one.

21:15.192 --> 21:17.060
For someone
who's never met one,

21:17.094 --> 21:19.428
you sure have a lot
of convenient knowledge.

21:19.463 --> 21:24.933
Laila passed a message...
"352 irrelevant."

21:24.968 --> 21:26.769
Any idea what that means?

21:29.338 --> 21:31.840
Uh... no.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.544
But it's... it sounds like your
friend didn't heed my warning.

21:35.578 --> 21:37.245
The Shepherds can be dangerous.

21:37.280 --> 21:41.149
Hank doesn't care about his
safety, but believe me, I do.

21:41.183 --> 21:43.551
No.... do you have any idea

21:43.585 --> 21:48.723
why The Shepherds are interested
in Asuncion, Paraguay?

21:48.757 --> 21:50.591
Believe me,
I wish I had your answers.

21:50.625 --> 21:54.896
But I'll... I'll look into,
um, Asuncion,

21:54.930 --> 21:57.764
for the sake of your friend.

22:06.473 --> 22:09.242
All right. So...

22:09.276 --> 22:10.944
This is the place.

22:23.824 --> 22:25.791
Gracias.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.899
_

22:31.019 --> 22:33.653
_

22:33.773 --> 22:35.783
_

22:35.903 --> 22:38.747
_

22:38.867 --> 22:40.573
_

22:42.847 --> 22:45.331
_

22:46.384 --> 22:49.206
_

22:49.326 --> 22:51.893
_

22:52.013 --> 22:54.565
_

23:13.170 --> 23:17.205
Oh! Oh, man, that was
a bumpy ride!

23:17.240 --> 23:19.808
Wow. It's kind of in the middle
of nowhere, isn't it,

23:19.842 --> 23:21.009
for a malaria clinic?

23:21.043 --> 23:22.244
Oh, they do lots of other work
around here.

23:22.278 --> 23:23.745
Immunization,
reproductive health,

23:23.780 --> 23:25.613
and patients come
from all over.

23:25.648 --> 23:27.015
Well, you gotta teach me
all of it.

23:27.049 --> 23:29.050
I will.

23:29.085 --> 23:30.551
How's the hangover?
It's killing me.

23:30.586 --> 23:32.186
You get me one aspirin,
I'm yours.

23:45.066 --> 23:46.267
Why would someone
build a clinic

23:46.301 --> 23:48.434
out in the middle of nowhere?

23:50.070 --> 23:51.237
And more importantly,

23:51.272 --> 23:53.739
why would Laila
be so interested in it?

23:58.545 --> 24:01.781
Doesn't look like
anyone's been here in a while.

24:01.816 --> 24:04.216
Can't know if we don't look.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.985
Unless you're afraid
of the curse.

24:07.020 --> 24:08.854
Maybe we <i>should</i> be.

24:29.308 --> 24:32.043
It's still warm.

24:32.077 --> 24:33.945
Somebody's here.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.445
All right, Laila.
What is all this?

24:50.479 --> 24:51.612
What were you up to?

24:54.716 --> 24:56.484
Thought you were
out with Paige,

24:56.518 --> 24:59.253
saving the world
one conspiracy theory at a time?

24:59.288 --> 25:00.688
I <i>was</i> out with Paige.

25:00.722 --> 25:02.991
We were looking up stuff
on the true cross.

25:07.661 --> 25:09.262
You're mad.

25:09.297 --> 25:13.666
Well, it hasn't been
the best day.

25:13.701 --> 25:14.934
I mean, I always thought
of Laila

25:14.969 --> 25:16.336
as the cool mom I never had.

25:16.371 --> 25:17.971
But it turns out
she's exactly like

25:18.006 --> 25:20.173
the "see ya later" mom
I already did have.

25:20.208 --> 25:21.874
I know it sucks.

25:21.908 --> 25:23.309
And I just thought,

25:23.343 --> 25:26.045
Arron's been through that.

25:26.079 --> 25:28.847
He knows how I feel.

25:28.882 --> 25:32.451
It'd be really nice
if he were here.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.221
I'm an idiot.

25:35.255 --> 25:38.056
I should've stayed here.
I'm sorry.

25:38.057 --> 25:39.824
It's fine. Um...

25:39.858 --> 25:42.394
Let's just get back to work.
 It's <i>not</i> fine.

25:42.428 --> 25:45.397
Look, I've known you
way too long to not see this.

25:45.431 --> 25:47.365
But I'm here now,

25:47.400 --> 25:49.667
and I promise with Laila
it'll be different

25:49.701 --> 25:52.270
because we'll find her.

25:52.304 --> 25:54.538
And you can
ask your questions, okay?

25:57.475 --> 26:00.144
That's maybe the most grown-up
thing I've ever heard you say.

26:01.646 --> 26:04.048
Besides...
Paige is major league.

26:04.082 --> 26:06.583
You're Double-A, so it'll
never work out.

26:06.617 --> 26:08.185
Thank you.

26:10.187 --> 26:12.155
You find anything in all this?

26:12.189 --> 26:13.656
Yeah, there might be
a connection.

26:13.690 --> 26:15.558
All these aid groups get their
funding from the same place.

26:15.592 --> 26:17.460
It's this organization.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.429
The 41 Trust.

26:19.463 --> 26:20.896
"Supporting innovation,
development,

26:20.931 --> 26:22.532
and health worldwide."

26:22.566 --> 26:23.699
It's one of the biggest
charities in the world.

26:23.733 --> 26:26.234
They have clinics
all over the globe.

26:26.269 --> 26:27.469
Any in Paraguay?

26:27.503 --> 26:28.937
Exactly one...

26:28.971 --> 26:30.272
The Santa Marta,

26:30.306 --> 26:32.840
but then it was inexplicably
and suddenly abandoned.

26:45.087 --> 26:46.753
Beck. Beck.

26:50.292 --> 26:52.726
"41 Trust Volunteer."

26:52.760 --> 26:55.196
Now crush up two pills
and put 'em in a glass of water.

26:58.499 --> 26:59.665
That's good.

27:01.335 --> 27:03.269
Nice and slow.

27:04.905 --> 27:07.006
Now you see?
You're a quick learner.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.674
I'm trying.

27:08.709 --> 27:11.110
Uh, you know what? It looks like
we're out of these pills.

27:11.144 --> 27:12.444
Where do I get more?

27:12.479 --> 27:15.848
Dr. Pitt... the skeevy one
who checked out your ass.

27:15.882 --> 27:19.218
Right. Lucky me.

27:25.457 --> 27:26.424
And...

27:26.458 --> 27:29.293
Here's your primaquine.

27:29.328 --> 27:31.663
Always nice to meet
a new volunteer.

27:35.801 --> 27:38.836
Can I ask you something?

27:38.870 --> 27:42.106
How do you deal
with all this?

27:42.140 --> 27:43.807
Easy there.

27:43.842 --> 27:44.875
What's the matter?

27:44.909 --> 27:46.243
It's just...

27:46.277 --> 27:50.480
You know, I-I came here
to help people.

27:50.515 --> 27:52.683
I didn't expect there to be
so much death.

27:52.717 --> 27:56.620
But then... I see those
body bags going into the morgue,

27:56.654 --> 27:58.121
- and I feel like...
- Hey, hey, hey.

27:58.156 --> 27:59.456
I should do something.

27:59.490 --> 28:02.091
Hey, we do the best we can.

28:06.063 --> 28:09.165
Some patients arrive too late.

28:09.199 --> 28:10.499
Yeah.

28:10.534 --> 28:13.335
I'm sorry.

28:13.370 --> 28:15.704
I'm really sorry.
I'm wasting your time.

28:15.738 --> 28:18.440
If you need to talk, I'm here.

29:17.029 --> 29:19.531
Primaquine.

29:19.565 --> 29:21.266
This used to be
a malaria clinic.

29:21.300 --> 29:23.034
You know your pharmaceuticals.

29:23.068 --> 29:25.770
Yeah. Theo used to be a doctor,
remember?

29:25.804 --> 29:27.505
What would Laila be doing
coming down

29:27.540 --> 29:29.906
to a broken-down malaria clinic?

29:31.276 --> 29:32.843
Hello?

29:32.877 --> 29:34.578
Hello?

29:35.980 --> 29:38.682
Paraguayan feds about the jeep.

29:38.717 --> 29:41.252
I can't get reception.
Hang on.

30:05.141 --> 30:07.142
You're thinking about running,

30:07.176 --> 30:09.911
but I love shooting men
in the back.

30:19.006 --> 30:21.810
Move on. <i>Move.</i>

30:21.930 --> 30:23.536
Move.

30:26.087 --> 30:28.221
We both came all the way here,

30:28.255 --> 30:30.423
hoping we would find Laila.

30:30.457 --> 30:32.926
But she's a tricky little bird,
and she's not here.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.730
It's ironic. You came down here
to find Laila,

30:36.764 --> 30:40.599
and she once came down here
and she found <i>you.</i>

30:42.837 --> 30:44.737
Are you sketched out
by all this?

30:44.771 --> 30:47.340
I never got an interview
this fast in my life.

30:47.374 --> 30:48.975
Just be cool.
Don't act suspicious.

30:49.009 --> 30:52.545
We're journalists
looking for a story.

30:52.579 --> 30:53.712
Hi. I'm Stan Jarvis,

30:53.746 --> 30:55.447
Vice President
for Public Relations.

30:55.481 --> 30:57.983
Uh, now you called about
the South America clinics?

30:58.017 --> 30:59.784
That's us.
Great.

30:59.819 --> 31:01.820
Which clinics are you doing
your story on specifically?

31:01.855 --> 31:04.689
Uh, the Santa Marta Clinic
in Paraguay.

31:04.724 --> 31:07.059
Well, then there must be
a little mix-up.

31:07.093 --> 31:10.061
We don't have a clinic
in Paraguay.

31:10.095 --> 31:11.963
Well you did.

31:11.997 --> 31:15.032
Until 2008.

31:17.269 --> 31:18.569
You know what?

31:18.603 --> 31:20.271
There is someone here
who can answer all of this

31:20.305 --> 31:24.075
so much better than I can.
If you'll come this way...

31:29.881 --> 31:32.082
This isn't a morgue.

31:32.116 --> 31:34.150
It's a lab.

31:34.185 --> 31:37.487
They were doing experiments
down here.

31:37.521 --> 31:39.622
Not just any experiments.

31:43.226 --> 31:45.194
Project Zero Hour...

31:45.228 --> 31:47.363
Didn't die with the Nazis.

31:47.397 --> 31:50.699
Death is only
a chance for rebirth.

31:50.733 --> 31:53.435
Why did Laila come down here?

31:53.469 --> 31:56.838
Hank, if I had all the answers,
I would have no use for you.

31:56.873 --> 31:59.908
I might not know why she came
here, but I know what she found.

32:56.895 --> 32:58.997
What?

33:02.533 --> 33:06.270
Tend your sick ones,
Oh Lord Christ.

33:10.842 --> 33:12.709
Aah!

33:17.948 --> 33:19.715
Aah! Aah!

33:33.162 --> 33:34.296
Emily, we have to leave.

33:34.330 --> 33:35.464
We have to get on this van
right now.

33:35.498 --> 33:36.798
Take it easy.
You're freaking out.

33:36.832 --> 33:37.966
This clinic's
not what it seems.

33:38.001 --> 33:39.134
Okay, you need to calm down.

33:39.168 --> 33:41.435
Take a breath.
This job can be hard.

33:42.637 --> 33:44.605
Emily? Emily.

33:46.508 --> 33:47.908
We've got
a line of patients here.

33:47.942 --> 33:50.277
Okay.
 Just trust me.

33:50.312 --> 33:51.479
Please come with me now.

33:51.513 --> 33:55.416
I have work to do.

34:07.761 --> 34:09.329
Let's go.

34:29.714 --> 34:31.549
The lab...

34:31.583 --> 34:32.616
It's been compromised.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.518
So clean the mess.

34:34.553 --> 34:36.286
What about the patients?

34:36.321 --> 34:37.455
The volunteers?

34:37.489 --> 34:39.790
<i>Clean</i> the mess.

34:46.164 --> 34:47.664
Oh. What happened here?

34:47.697 --> 34:50.800
Remarkable work which could
never be shared with the world.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.835
Sit.

34:52.870 --> 34:55.172
Your wife knew a bit about it.

34:55.206 --> 34:56.873
She wrote it on a note.

34:56.907 --> 34:58.475
I believe...

34:58.509 --> 35:01.577
"352 irrelevant."

35:01.611 --> 35:04.313
Tell me what 352 is.

35:04.347 --> 35:07.183
The answer
to all our questions.

35:08.885 --> 35:10.519
I found it on the ground,

35:10.554 --> 35:13.655
the only evidence
to survive their cleanup.

35:13.690 --> 35:17.058
It's almost as if fate meant for
us to discover this together.

35:21.382 --> 35:24.680
_

35:28.444 --> 35:30.709
_

35:30.829 --> 35:33.010
_

35:33.641 --> 35:34.774
Hank!

35:47.788 --> 35:51.390
You want to know
what Laila found here?

35:51.425 --> 35:54.327
She found <i>you.</i>

36:09.461 --> 36:12.152
I'm Melanie Lynch,
director of The 41 Trust.

36:12.272 --> 36:15.164
We were fascinated by your call

36:15.198 --> 36:16.332
because frankly,

36:16.366 --> 36:20.169
no one is interested
in South America anymore.

36:21.938 --> 36:23.272
So tell me,

36:23.306 --> 36:25.174
why the interest?

36:25.208 --> 36:26.509
Uh, well, we doing a story

36:26.543 --> 36:29.778
about the Santa Marta Clinic
in Paraguay.

36:29.812 --> 36:32.980
It, uh, apparently
was abandoned.

36:33.015 --> 36:35.683
Your clinics are famous for
their long-term sustainability,

36:35.717 --> 36:38.119
and yet you abandoned this one.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.054
We wanna know why.

36:42.458 --> 36:44.058
Here's what I said
in my Ted talk,

36:44.092 --> 36:45.693
if you haven't seen it.

36:45.727 --> 36:47.494
Compassion is a commodity,

36:47.529 --> 36:51.131
same as gold, steel, or timber.

36:51.166 --> 36:55.101
There is a finite amount
in the world.

36:55.136 --> 36:58.004
Compassion is also a science.

36:58.039 --> 37:00.740
The 41 Trust...

37:00.775 --> 37:05.044
we invest money
where it matters most.

37:05.078 --> 37:08.814
If a clinic fails, we can't
throw good money after bad.

37:08.848 --> 37:13.686
Paraguay was failing, so we
spread our resources elsewhere.

37:13.720 --> 37:15.954
But I'm curious

37:15.989 --> 37:18.123
why "Modern Skeptic" magazine

37:18.158 --> 37:22.627
would be so... interested
in my foundation?

37:26.932 --> 37:30.802
The trust murdered 32 people
to keep that clinic secret.

37:30.836 --> 37:32.404
Patients, volunteers.

37:32.438 --> 37:34.839
I had a friend that worked... I
told you there'd be sacrifices.

37:34.873 --> 37:36.574
I thought you meant from <i>me.</i>

37:36.608 --> 37:38.275
Those people didn't get
a choice.

37:38.310 --> 37:39.943
Sometimes the lamb must fall.

37:39.977 --> 37:41.579
32 lambs for <i>that</i> file.

37:41.613 --> 37:43.681
Not just any file.

37:43.715 --> 37:46.750
The key to stopping Zero Hour.

37:46.784 --> 37:49.820
God thanks you, sister.

37:49.854 --> 37:53.456
I wanna carry out His will.
I do.

37:53.490 --> 37:54.890
But the things
that we do are...

37:54.925 --> 37:58.094
Won't get easier.

37:58.128 --> 38:01.631
We need you to keep watch
on 352.

38:01.665 --> 38:04.800
Get close to him
and learn everything you can.

38:11.541 --> 38:13.908
<i>Isn't it beautiful,</i>

38:13.943 --> 38:18.313
when the fragments
of the universe align...

38:19.649 --> 38:23.184
And you realize your part
in it?

38:23.219 --> 38:26.020
Who is that man?

38:26.055 --> 38:28.156
Like you said, brother,
I don't have all the answers.

38:28.190 --> 38:30.925
I only just found this.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.895
His eyes... they're like yours.

38:33.929 --> 38:35.063
So why do you think

38:35.097 --> 38:36.564
your wife came down here
in the first place?

38:36.598 --> 38:37.899
I don't know!

38:37.933 --> 38:40.901
Because you didn't have a chance
to ask her.

38:40.935 --> 38:44.004
Together we can catch
that little bird.

38:44.038 --> 38:46.039
Come with me. Find her.

38:46.074 --> 38:50.043
<i>Demand</i> your answers.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.045
Because you see?

38:52.080 --> 38:55.749
353.

38:55.783 --> 38:57.950
We are the ones
that share a fate.

38:59.286 --> 39:00.853
Hank, get out of the way!

39:02.689 --> 39:03.790
Aah!

39:06.960 --> 39:10.196
You got lucky once.

39:10.230 --> 39:11.563
But luck is fleeting.

39:24.376 --> 39:26.077
So...

39:26.112 --> 39:27.312
please...

39:27.346 --> 39:30.781
tell me where it hurts.

39:30.816 --> 39:31.949
Aah!
Uhh!

39:31.983 --> 39:33.650
Beck, come on.

39:33.685 --> 39:34.885
Come on.

39:44.128 --> 39:47.130
We're almost there.

39:48.833 --> 39:50.133
Ah.

39:50.167 --> 39:52.869
Hank! Hank!

39:52.903 --> 39:55.238
Come out! Come out!
Sh shh, shh.

39:55.272 --> 39:56.539
We gotta stop
the bleeding.

39:56.573 --> 39:59.675
You'll be okay.
Come out, wherever you are!

39:59.710 --> 40:01.944
Don't panic.

40:01.978 --> 40:03.745
Hank, I won't kill you.

40:05.381 --> 40:07.382
The bitch is dead!

40:07.416 --> 40:10.118
She just has to bleed first!

40:10.153 --> 40:12.620
Don't listen to him.

40:12.655 --> 40:14.522
You're gonna be okay.

40:14.557 --> 40:16.257
- I offered you the light of reality...
- Shh. Don't listen.

40:16.291 --> 40:19.927
And you spit on me, brother!

40:19.962 --> 40:21.896
But you can still come with me

40:21.930 --> 40:25.198
to shake truth out of your wife.

40:25.233 --> 40:27.501
We owe everything to you.

40:27.535 --> 40:29.370
You kept watch on 352,

40:29.404 --> 40:31.171
you returned the clocks,

40:31.205 --> 40:34.375
and now the cross is safe.

40:34.409 --> 40:37.611
In this box are symbols
of your old life

40:37.645 --> 40:40.045
as Laila Galliston.

40:44.585 --> 40:47.353
I'm ready
to burn that life away.

40:47.388 --> 40:50.356
Five years is a long time.

40:57.897 --> 41:00.965
You sure you can
leave that behind?

41:03.369 --> 41:06.004
I'm sure.

41:31.295 --> 41:33.663
Your wife betrayed you.

41:38.636 --> 41:42.972
Your wife betrayed you!

41:43.006 --> 41:45.941
She betrayed you, brother.

41:45.975 --> 41:48.844
This is your last chance
to come with me!

41:48.878 --> 41:50.712
To find her!

41:52.048 --> 41:53.449
I offer you brotherhood,

41:53.483 --> 41:56.518
and you choose another path,
and that cannot be forgiven!

41:56.553 --> 41:58.654
We're done, you and I.

41:58.688 --> 42:01.422
You will stay forever blind

42:01.457 --> 42:04.859
to the truth about
what you really are.

42:10.065 --> 42:12.733
Protect us, Lord...

42:14.903 --> 42:16.069
all your lambs.
