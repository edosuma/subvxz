01:26.963 --> 01:29.632
Good morning, Miss Swallow.

01:29.667 --> 01:33.624
- Why, what's the matter?
- Dr. Huxley is thinking.

01:43.677 --> 01:46.781
Alice, I think this one
must belong in the tail.

01:46.816 --> 01:49.884
Nonsense. You tried it in the
tail yesterday and it didn't fit.

01:49.919 --> 01:51.919
Yes, that's right. I did, didn't I?

01:51.954 --> 01:55.889
David, it's a telegram for you from Utah.
It's from the expedition.

01:55.924 --> 01:59.882
The expedition! Open
it. I'll be right down.

02:02.829 --> 02:06.432
David, they found it! They found it, David!

02:06.467 --> 02:08.000
Not the intercostal clavicle?

02:08.035 --> 02:10.902
It's on its way. It'll be here tomorrow.

02:10.937 --> 02:12.805
Just think of it, Professor.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.040
The very last bone we needed
to complete the brontosaurus.

02:16.075 --> 02:19.744
The intercostal clavicle is arriving
tomorrow after four years' hard work.

02:19.779 --> 02:23.514
- Congratulations, my boy.
- Isn't it great? I can hardly believe it!

02:23.549 --> 02:26.683
Stop it. Really, David, there's a time
and place for everything.

02:26.718 --> 02:28.151
What will Prof. LaTouche think?

02:28.186 --> 02:30.220
After all, you're getting married tomorrow.

02:30.255 --> 02:33.824
- Yes, I know we are...
- Right, we're getting married tomorrow.

02:33.859 --> 02:36.859
Isn't that odd? Two important things
happening on the same day.

02:36.894 --> 02:39.028
I think the occasion
calls for a celebration.

02:39.063 --> 02:40.529
Don't worry, we'll celebrate.

02:40.564 --> 02:42.698
We're going away
directly after we're married.

02:42.733 --> 02:46.534
Going away? What are you thinking of,
David? After receiving this telegram?

02:46.569 --> 02:49.504
As soon as we're married,
we're coming directly back here...

02:49.539 --> 02:51.806
- and you're going on with your work.
- Alice.

02:51.841 --> 02:55.710
Now, once and for all, David,
nothing must interfere with your work.

02:55.745 --> 02:59.580
Our marriage must entail
no domestic entanglements of any kind.

02:59.615 --> 03:02.282
- You mean...
- I mean of any kind, David.

03:02.317 --> 03:06.275
Alice, I was sort of hoping...
You mean children, all that sort of thing?

03:07.053 --> 03:11.046
Exactly. This will be our child.

03:11.624 --> 03:15.628
Yes, David, I see our marriage
purely as a dedication to your work.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.730
Alice, everybody has to have
a honeymoon and...

03:18.765 --> 03:21.299
We haven't time.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.735
You have an appointment this afternoon.

03:23.770 --> 03:27.728
- Have I? What for?
- To play golf with Mr. Peabody.

03:27.772 --> 03:28.906
What Peabody?

03:28.941 --> 03:31.775
The Alexander Peabody
who represents Mrs. Carleton Random.

03:31.810 --> 03:32.843
Now let me think.

03:32.878 --> 03:36.080
Who may donate $1 million
to the museum to complete all this.

03:36.115 --> 03:38.581
Oh, sure! That Mr. Peabody.

03:38.616 --> 03:41.150
$1 million.
That's pretty white of Mr. Peabody.

03:41.185 --> 03:42.619
You haven't got it yet.

03:42.654 --> 03:46.189
Let me remind you that a lot depends
on the impression you make on him.

03:46.224 --> 03:50.092
Don't worry. After I've received this,
I feel good for anything.

03:50.127 --> 03:52.060
I'll wow him, I'll knock him for a loop.

03:52.095 --> 03:54.696
David, no slang.
Remember who and what you are.

03:54.731 --> 03:57.032
- That's right.
- Go on. You mustn't keep him waiting.

03:57.067 --> 04:00.268
- Goodbye, Alice. I mean, Professor.
- Don't forget your golf clubs.

04:00.303 --> 04:03.337
Remember, let Mr. Peabody win.

04:03.372 --> 04:05.106
Yes, Alice. I will.

04:05.141 --> 04:09.099
Oh, dear. Excuse me.

04:09.610 --> 04:10.977
I can't tell you, Mr. Peabody...

04:11.012 --> 04:13.280
how much this endowment
would mean to the museum...

04:13.315 --> 04:14.781
and to me personally.

04:14.816 --> 04:17.117
If you could just give me
some assurance...

04:17.152 --> 04:19.619
If you could give me some assurance
that you'd...

04:19.654 --> 04:23.611
consider us first before you donate that
million to anyone else, I'd appreciate it.

04:23.689 --> 04:26.292
Dr. Huxley, you seem to be
under some misapprehension.

04:26.327 --> 04:28.127
I haven't got $1 million.

04:28.162 --> 04:30.796
I represent the possible donor,
Mrs. Carleton Random...

04:30.831 --> 04:32.764
whose legal advisor I happen to be.

04:32.799 --> 04:36.034
Yes, of course. I forgot.

04:36.069 --> 04:38.570
Mr. Peabody, then I wonder...

04:38.605 --> 04:42.272
if you could use your influence
with Mrs. Random, that would be nice.

04:42.307 --> 04:46.265
Dr. Huxley, when I play golf,
I only talk golf...

04:46.343 --> 04:49.146
- and then only between shots.
- Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

04:49.181 --> 04:53.138
Couldn't we continue this discussion
over a whisky and soda after our game?

04:54.150 --> 04:55.184
Yes, we could.

04:55.219 --> 04:59.177
Meantime, I believe you hooked your ball.

04:59.655 --> 05:03.258
Yes, I did.
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody.

05:03.293 --> 05:07.251
Yes. All right.

05:07.395 --> 05:11.388
Look! You can't...

05:11.666 --> 05:15.035
That's my ball. Just a minute!

05:15.070 --> 05:16.804
Here's hoping.

05:16.839 --> 05:19.807
I say, just a minute. I beg your pardon.

05:19.842 --> 05:20.975
Oh, dear.

05:21.010 --> 05:24.077
- You shouldn't do that, you know.
- What shouldn't I do?

05:24.112 --> 05:25.378
Talk while someone's shooting.

05:25.413 --> 05:27.847
Anyway, I forgive you
because I got a good shot.

05:27.882 --> 05:30.149
- You don't understand.
- It's right next to the pin.

05:30.184 --> 05:31.684
That has nothing to do with it.

05:31.719 --> 05:33.987
- You playing through?
- I've just teed off.

05:34.022 --> 05:36.388
You must be a stranger here.
You should be over there.

05:36.423 --> 05:40.381
This is the 18th fairway and I'm on the
green. If I sink this, I'll beat my record.

05:41.126 --> 05:44.062
Be there in a minute!
What kind of ball are you playing?

05:44.097 --> 05:46.197
- PGA.
- I'm playing a CrowFlight.

05:46.232 --> 05:48.032
I like a PGA better.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.167
I'm trying to prove
that you're playing my ball.

05:50.202 --> 05:53.804
A PGA has two black dots,
and a CrowFlight has a circle.

05:53.839 --> 05:55.872
I'm not superstitious.

05:55.907 --> 05:59.865
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Stop talking and take out the pin.

06:00.944 --> 06:04.937
Oh, my, this is so silly.

06:04.981 --> 06:06.281
See? It's a circle.

06:06.316 --> 06:08.984
Of course. Do you think
it would roll if it were square?

06:09.019 --> 06:12.977
I have reference to a mark on the ball.
That proves it's a CrowFlight. That's mine.

06:13.055 --> 06:15.124
What does it matter?
It's only a game, anyway.

06:15.159 --> 06:17.058
Young lady, you don't seem to realize...

06:17.093 --> 06:19.727
you've placed me
in a very embarrassing position.

06:19.762 --> 06:20.795
Really? I'm sorry.

06:20.830 --> 06:24.432
The most important lawyer in New York
is waiting for me on the first fairway.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.401
Then it's silly of you
to be fooling around on the 18th green.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.770
You don't mind if I take this with me?

06:29.805 --> 06:30.871
Not at all.

06:30.906 --> 06:34.864
Tell the caddy master to put it in my bag
when you're finished.

06:36.276 --> 06:39.245
Huxley, come on!

06:39.280 --> 06:43.238
Yes, I'll be with you in a minute,
Mr. Peabody!

06:50.422 --> 06:54.415
Hey, mister, I think that's your car.

06:59.830 --> 07:03.823
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

07:12.308 --> 07:13.776
What do you think you're doing?

07:13.811 --> 07:15.378
I'm trying to un-park my car.

07:15.413 --> 07:17.513
- Oh, hello.
- This is my car!

07:17.548 --> 07:19.848
Good. Would you mind
moving it out of the way?

07:19.883 --> 07:22.884
- No. This is my car.
- Yes, I understand that.

07:22.919 --> 07:25.387
If you move it back four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

07:25.422 --> 07:29.357
I'm afraid you've made a mistake.
Maybe this is yours. What did you say?

07:29.392 --> 07:32.993
I said if you move it back about four feet,
I'll be able to get out.

07:33.028 --> 07:35.262
I'm in a terrible hurry, and I can't budge.

07:35.297 --> 07:38.165
- You want me to move your car?
- Would you mind terribly?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.501
- Yes, I will, but...
- That would be awfully kind.

07:40.536 --> 07:44.493
- Take it very easy.
- Yes, I'll go slowly.

07:46.372 --> 07:48.007
What are you doing?

07:48.042 --> 07:50.110
I have to get into position.

07:50.145 --> 07:51.376
Please be careful.

07:51.411 --> 07:53.512
I will. Now, you say when.

07:53.547 --> 07:55.347
- Yes, all right.
- Am I clear?

07:55.382 --> 07:59.340
Yes, you're clear now.

08:01.386 --> 08:04.355
- Now look what you've done.
- That's all right. I'm insured.

08:04.390 --> 08:07.792
I don't care whether you're insured or not!

08:07.827 --> 08:09.193
Let me drive this car.

08:09.228 --> 08:12.196
It's all right. It's an old wreck, anyway.
It doesn't matter.

08:12.231 --> 08:15.398
You don't understand. This is my car!

08:15.433 --> 08:17.968
- You mean this is your car?
- Of course.

08:18.003 --> 08:19.836
Your golf ball, your car?

08:19.871 --> 08:22.472
Is there anything in the world
that doesn't belong to you?

08:22.507 --> 08:24.039
Yes, thank heaven. You!

08:24.074 --> 08:26.008
Now, don't lose your temper.

08:26.043 --> 08:30.001
Young lady, I'm not losing my temper.
I'm merely trying to play some golf.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.182
You choose the funniest places.
This is a parking lot.

08:33.217 --> 08:34.549
Will you get out of my car?

08:34.583 --> 08:37.352
- Get off my running board.
- This is my running board!

08:37.386 --> 08:39.988
All right, honey, stay there.

08:40.023 --> 08:41.222
Help me!

08:41.256 --> 08:43.357
Don't think everything
in the world is yours.

08:43.393 --> 08:47.327
This is my car, I'll handle it.

08:47.362 --> 08:50.998
If you want to come with me, go ahead.

08:51.033 --> 08:54.990
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Peabody!

09:06.578 --> 09:08.013
Good evening, sir.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.817
I'm looking for Mr. Alexander Peabody.
I believe he's dining here.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.552
Mr. Peabody has not arrived yet.

09:13.587 --> 09:15.986
Is that so? Well, I'll just wait.

09:16.021 --> 09:17.955
- Yes, sir.
- Good evening, Louis.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.091
- Good evening, Mr. Brown. Right this way.
- Thank you.

09:21.126 --> 09:23.027
May I check your hat, sir?

09:23.062 --> 09:24.862
- Excuse me?
- Check your hat?

09:24.897 --> 09:28.398
No, I better... Maybe you'd...

09:28.433 --> 09:30.934
I'm sorry.

09:30.969 --> 09:34.927
Look at that. I dropped my hat.
I'd better hang on to it.

09:36.272 --> 09:38.440
- Now, watch very carefully.
- I'm watching.

09:38.475 --> 09:42.433
I take an olive, I throw it in that glass,
but there it is.

09:43.178 --> 09:46.281
- Now I throw it in that one.
- Wait. Now, without the... Go on.

09:46.316 --> 09:48.649
Watch.

09:48.684 --> 09:52.119
I know what happens. That's wonderful.
You take three, don't you?

09:52.154 --> 09:54.255
Only you cheated.
You can see me take three.

09:54.290 --> 09:57.024
You throw it in the glass.
Take another one, throw it.

09:57.059 --> 10:01.016
- Good!
- And then you do this.

10:02.362 --> 10:06.032
I'm so sorry. Oh, hello.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.968
You're sitting on your hat.

10:08.003 --> 10:10.469
- I know it.
- That's silly. Get up. I'm awfully sorry.

10:10.504 --> 10:12.471
I couldn't be more apologetic, really.

10:12.506 --> 10:15.040
Well, I might have known you were here.

10:15.075 --> 10:17.309
I had a feeling just as I hit the floor.

10:17.344 --> 10:20.144
That was your hat.

10:20.179 --> 10:21.980
Look at it. Look.

10:22.015 --> 10:24.015
Yes, it's too bad, isn't it?

10:24.050 --> 10:27.118
Joe here was showing me a trick,
and the olive got away.

10:27.153 --> 10:30.621
First you drop an olive, then I sit
on my hat. It all fits perfectly.

10:30.656 --> 10:33.457
You can't do that trick
without dropping some of the olives.

10:33.492 --> 10:34.492
It takes practice.

10:34.526 --> 10:36.159
What, to sit on my hat?

10:36.194 --> 10:39.096
No, to drop an olive.

10:39.131 --> 10:42.265
Now, if you're going to be angry with me,
what can I do?

10:42.300 --> 10:43.532
Go away.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.668
No. I was here first.

10:45.703 --> 10:49.661
- Then I'll go away.
- What, you...

11:09.590 --> 11:11.991
Won't you just take the olive dish?

11:12.026 --> 11:14.594
No, it's all right.
I'll sit here. You don't mind, do you?

11:14.629 --> 11:16.562
- Not at all.
- This is rather difficult.

11:16.597 --> 11:18.164
- I guess it is.
- Goodness.

11:18.199 --> 11:21.034
Your face is familiar.
Haven't we met somewhere?

11:21.069 --> 11:22.100
Not to my knowledge.

11:22.135 --> 11:24.269
You're wrong. My name's Susan Vance.

11:24.304 --> 11:26.104
I'm Dr. Fritz Lehman.

11:26.139 --> 11:28.674
That's all right. You can sit down.
I don't mind at all.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.944
- You may have heard me lecture.
- What do you lecture about?

11:31.979 --> 11:35.936
I usually talk about nervous disorders.
I am a psychiatrist.

11:35.980 --> 11:37.515
Oh, crazy people.

11:37.550 --> 11:39.317
We dislike the use of that word.

11:39.352 --> 11:43.253
All people who behave strangely
are not insane.

11:43.288 --> 11:46.289
Is that so?

11:46.324 --> 11:49.559
Would you mind if I asked your
professional opinion about something?

11:49.594 --> 11:51.061
Not at all.

11:51.096 --> 11:53.729
What would you say about a man
who follows a girl around...

11:53.764 --> 11:56.398
and then when she talks to him,
he fights with her?

11:56.433 --> 11:59.101
Fights with her?
Is the young man your fiancé?

11:59.136 --> 12:02.004
No. I don't know,
I never even saw him before today.

12:02.039 --> 12:05.106
No, he just follows me around
and fights with me.

12:05.141 --> 12:09.099
The love impulse in man very frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

12:10.445 --> 12:11.713
The love impulse?

12:11.748 --> 12:14.115
Without my knowing anything about it...

12:14.150 --> 12:17.417
my rough guess would be that he
has a fixation on you. A fixation...

12:17.452 --> 12:20.687
Wait a minute, I can't remember
more than that. A fixation?

12:20.722 --> 12:24.680
"The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict."

12:26.258 --> 12:28.461
- That's right.
- I'm eternally grateful to you.

12:28.496 --> 12:31.664
You're absolutely wonderful.
Thank you very much.

12:31.699 --> 12:34.266
Do you know why you're following me?
You're a fixation.

12:34.301 --> 12:37.402
I'm not following you.
I haven't moved from this spot.

12:37.437 --> 12:38.737
Please, you're following me.

12:38.772 --> 12:41.272
Don't be absurd.
Who's always behind whom?

12:41.307 --> 12:44.242
My dear young lady,
I haven't been behind anything...

12:44.277 --> 12:47.177
but what they call the eight ball.
I haven't been all day.

12:47.212 --> 12:49.480
- You're angry, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

12:49.515 --> 12:53.017
The love impulse in man frequently
reveals itself in terms of conflict.

12:53.052 --> 12:55.219
- Excuse me. The what impulse?
- Love impulse.

12:55.254 --> 12:57.186
The trouble with you is that you have a...

12:57.221 --> 12:58.788
Look, all I'm trying to do...

12:58.823 --> 13:01.157
is find the gentleman whom,
thanks to you...

13:01.192 --> 13:04.394
I abandoned on the golf course today.
That's all. Now please go...

13:04.429 --> 13:06.596
Say, this isn't...
Where do you suppose I...

13:06.631 --> 13:10.588
- Hold this a minute. I'll be right back.
- Yes.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.303
Missed.

13:15.338 --> 13:17.472
- I'm sorry I was so long.
- It's quite all right.

13:17.507 --> 13:21.342
I had a very entertaining conversation
with a young lady who does tricks...

13:21.377 --> 13:23.811
with olives when she gets it right.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.646
Fritz, where's my purse?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.381
I thought you had it with you.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.682
No, I left it right here on the table.

13:29.717 --> 13:33.675
- My diamond pin was in it.
- Your diamond pin?

13:39.825 --> 13:43.162
You just lost a diamond pin.
We're going to find it, all right?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.364
- Don't worry about it.
- Excuse me.

13:45.399 --> 13:48.300
Why, there it is. Thank you very much.
It's very kind of you.

13:48.335 --> 13:49.600
- Thank you.
- Why, no.

13:49.635 --> 13:51.502
This is my purse. My diamond pin is in it.

13:51.537 --> 13:53.538
- Will you please...
- No, I'm afraid...

13:53.573 --> 13:55.673
- Give me that.
- Will you please hand it over?

13:55.708 --> 13:59.177
- Do something about it.
- Keep out of it, darling.

13:59.212 --> 14:03.169
- I did the trick.
- You did? Good.

14:04.081 --> 14:07.417
It is madness for you
to say it's not my wife's.

14:07.452 --> 14:09.486
You've made a slight blunder.
This belongs...

14:09.521 --> 14:11.821
There is the young lady.
Isn't this your purse?

14:11.856 --> 14:14.723
- No, this is my purse.
- There you are. Hand it over.

14:14.758 --> 14:17.326
Just a minute.
Didn't you give me this purse to hold?

14:17.361 --> 14:19.895
Yes, that's right, I did.
I gave him the purse to hold.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.363
There's been a mistake. I lost my purse.

14:22.398 --> 14:24.632
I must've picked up your wife's purse
by mistake.

14:24.667 --> 14:27.235
I wanted him to stay here,
so I gave him this purse...

14:27.270 --> 14:29.270
while I went to find mine.
I was coming back.

14:29.305 --> 14:32.406
- Now, that's all perfectly clear, isn't it?
- No, it isn't.

14:32.441 --> 14:35.242
- She's going to give me an explanation.
- No!

14:35.277 --> 14:38.579
My dear sir, it never will be clear
as long as she's explaining it.

14:38.614 --> 14:40.447
- Now please let me go.
- Just a minute.

14:40.482 --> 14:41.648
He's innocent.

14:41.683 --> 14:44.650
Now you have your wife's purse,
I have my purse...

14:44.685 --> 14:48.321
and Louie will explain it all to you
and everything will be all right.

14:48.571 --> 14:51.674
Please listen.
You can't think I did that intentionally.

14:51.709 --> 14:54.476
If I could think,
I'd have run when I saw you.

14:54.511 --> 14:58.469
If you'd only let me explain.
I just gave you my purse to...

15:00.048 --> 15:04.040
You've torn your coat.

15:04.118 --> 15:07.588
Now, I didn't do it on purpose.
That's not right. It's not my fault.

15:07.623 --> 15:11.581
I did it, but I didn't mean to do it.
I just caught hold of your coat.

15:11.892 --> 15:13.893
Will you do something for me?

15:13.928 --> 15:14.994
A needle?

15:15.029 --> 15:18.398
No, it's simpler than that.
Let's play a game.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.032
What?

15:20.067 --> 15:24.024
Watch. I'll put my hand over my eyes,
and then you go away. See?

15:24.136 --> 15:26.738
Then I'll count to 10,
and when I take my hand down...

15:26.773 --> 15:28.940
you will be gone. One...

15:28.975 --> 15:32.144
I like that. I was only trying to be nice.

15:32.179 --> 15:34.712
Thank you.

15:34.747 --> 15:35.780
Just a minute!

15:35.815 --> 15:38.115
You can't talk to me that way
then crawl out of it.

15:38.150 --> 15:41.152
- When I'm mad, I'm mad.
- Something horrible has happened.

15:41.187 --> 15:44.021
Don't tell me about it.
Just get out of it as best you can.

15:44.056 --> 15:47.957
Please stop following me around,
fixation or no fixation. I've had enough.

15:47.992 --> 15:50.994
- Stop talking, so I can tell you...
- Will you stop crowding me?

15:51.029 --> 15:54.164
- I'm just trying to tell you, you've torn...
- No, I didn't.

15:54.199 --> 15:57.099
- If you'd waited for my explanation...
- Not my coat...

15:57.134 --> 16:01.092
...your coat would still be very all right.

16:01.703 --> 16:05.207
- What is the matter with you?
- You see, I...

16:05.242 --> 16:07.875
Do you realize you're making
a fool out of yourself?

16:07.910 --> 16:11.579
You can't tell me I tore your coat.
There's such a thing as being fair.

16:11.614 --> 16:13.881
Will you please stop doing that
with your hat?

16:13.916 --> 16:15.983
Just stand there, will you?

16:16.018 --> 16:17.784
What in the world is going on?

16:17.819 --> 16:20.086
- No! Please don't move!
- I've had enough of this.

16:20.121 --> 16:23.056
Listen to me. Let's get out of here.
Just start walking.

16:23.091 --> 16:24.591
So now you want to walk.

16:24.626 --> 16:27.160
Well, I'm quite sure
that I don't want to walk with you.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.563
I hope you realize that you've made
a perfect spectacle of yourself.

16:30.598 --> 16:31.864
Have you finished?

16:31.899 --> 16:35.857
- Yes.
- Thank you.

16:39.938 --> 16:42.173
Don't just stand there. Do something.

16:42.208 --> 16:44.776
Oh, my goodness. Get behind me.

16:44.811 --> 16:46.010
- I am behind you.
- Get closer.

16:46.045 --> 16:50.002
I can't get any closer. Are you ready?
Be calm. Left foot first.

16:54.985 --> 16:58.255
- Go straight out the door.
- I have to meet someone here. There he is.

16:58.290 --> 16:59.655
Don't you dare leave me.

16:59.690 --> 17:03.648
I'll be with you in a minute, sir.

17:07.829 --> 17:11.821
It's very important that I meet this man
to explain to him what happened...

17:11.967 --> 17:14.669
although if I saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say.

17:14.704 --> 17:15.871
It's perfectly simple.

17:15.906 --> 17:18.973
Tell him you met someone you knew
and were detained.

17:19.009 --> 17:22.965
I can picture myself explaining our exit
from the Ritz Plaza to Mr. Peabody.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.813
It's not Boopie that you're trying to see?

17:25.848 --> 17:27.248
No. His name's Peabody.

17:27.282 --> 17:30.150
Alexander Peabody.
But that's Boopie, and I know him well.

17:30.185 --> 17:33.820
I was going to have supper
with him tonight. He'll do anything I ask.

17:33.855 --> 17:37.690
- Let's go to the Ritz and catch him.
- I'd better go there alone.

17:37.725 --> 17:41.682
If we miss him there,
we'll go out to Riverdale. There you are.

17:41.827 --> 17:45.820
- I couldn't spend that much time.
- Riverdale's only half an hour away.

17:45.864 --> 17:49.701
Yes, but I have to go to Carnegie Hall
to meet Miss Swallow.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.693
- Miss Swallow?
- Yes. I'm engaged to Miss Swallow.

17:53.804 --> 17:56.073
Engaged to be married?

17:56.108 --> 17:58.309
- That's right.
- That's nice.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.679
- Then she won't mind waiting, will she?
- I wouldn't like to...

18:01.714 --> 18:04.180
If I were engaged to you,
I wouldn't mind waiting at all.

18:04.215 --> 18:08.173
- I'd wait for ever.
- But it wouldn't be right.

18:13.556 --> 18:17.549
- I finally got you here, didn't I?
- Yes.

18:19.194 --> 18:23.186
Susan, do they build all the houses
in Riverdale alike?

18:23.331 --> 18:24.899
I don't think so. Why?

18:24.934 --> 18:28.892
Because if they don't, we've passed
this one six times in the last hour.

18:29.370 --> 18:32.907
But it was such a lovely night
for a drive. Come on.

18:32.942 --> 18:35.208
Oh, dear.

18:35.243 --> 18:38.145
There aren't any lights.
Mr. Peabody must have gone to bed.

18:38.180 --> 18:41.214
No, he couldn't have gone
to bed this soon. It's early.

18:41.249 --> 18:44.650
If they expected you, they could,
with the covers over their heads.

18:44.685 --> 18:48.187
If you don't stop nagging, I won't help you
arrange matters with Boopie.

18:48.222 --> 18:50.389
I've a feeling it might be better
if you didn't.

18:50.424 --> 18:53.025
- Why?
- I don't think we ought to do this, Susan.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.293
If we wake him up, he'll be irritable.

18:55.328 --> 18:59.286
I don't think it's gonna work,
but I know where Boopie sleeps.

18:59.998 --> 19:02.233
You can't climb
in a man's bedroom window.

19:02.268 --> 19:06.225
I know. It's on the second floor.

19:06.804 --> 19:09.139
Please, it's too late now.
You can't wake him up.

19:09.174 --> 19:11.609
Can't I?

19:11.644 --> 19:12.710
What are you doing?

19:12.745 --> 19:14.745
- Pebbles.
- What for?

19:14.780 --> 19:18.047
If you throw pebbles against a window,
people think it's hail...

19:18.082 --> 19:22.040
and then they come and close the window.

19:25.355 --> 19:28.390
I know we ought to go now,
but somehow I can't move.

19:28.425 --> 19:30.826
I guess they weren't big enough.

19:30.861 --> 19:34.096
Why not...

19:34.131 --> 19:35.864
What?

19:35.899 --> 19:39.856
- Here's a pip.
- Just a minute!

19:41.268 --> 19:45.261
Jeepers! Let's get out of here.

19:48.942 --> 19:51.311
Don't worry,
everything's going to be all right.

19:51.346 --> 19:54.814
Tomorrow, when Boopie's calmed down,
we'll go and see him together.

19:54.849 --> 19:58.450
Now, just a moment. Don't think
that I don't appreciate all you've done...

19:58.485 --> 19:59.852
It was nothing, David...

19:59.887 --> 20:03.022
Just a moment. But there are limits
to what a man can bear.

20:03.057 --> 20:07.015
Besides, tomorrow afternoon
I'm going to get married.

20:09.260 --> 20:10.795
What for?

20:10.830 --> 20:14.788
Because... Anyway, I'm going
to get married, and don't interrupt.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.992
Now, my future wife has always
regarded me as a man of some dignity.

20:22.939 --> 20:26.143
Privately, I'm convinced
that I have some dignity.

20:26.178 --> 20:28.245
Now, it isn't that I
don't like you, Susan...

20:28.280 --> 20:32.181
because after all, in moments of quiet,
I'm strangely drawn towards you...

20:32.216 --> 20:34.417
but there haven't been
any quiet moments.

20:34.452 --> 20:37.486
Our relationship has been
a series of misadventures...

20:37.521 --> 20:39.155
from beginning to end.

20:39.190 --> 20:43.147
So if you don't mind,
I'll see Mr. Peabody alone and unarmed.

20:43.692 --> 20:44.759
Without me?

20:44.794 --> 20:47.429
Yes, without you,
and definitely without you.

20:47.464 --> 20:49.798
Now, Susan, I'm going to say goodnight.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.790
And I hope that I never set eyes
on you again. Goodnight.

21:08.881 --> 21:12.451
Yes, I did see Mr. Peabody,
but I didn't see him.

21:12.486 --> 21:16.444
That is, I didn't see him really.

21:16.521 --> 21:19.324
Yes, I spoke to him twice,
but I didn't talk to him.

21:19.359 --> 21:23.316
But I don't understand.
Did you see him or didn't you?

21:24.462 --> 21:27.131
No, I don't know.

21:27.166 --> 21:30.534
How do I know? Because...

21:30.569 --> 21:33.069
There's someone at the door.

21:33.104 --> 21:36.406
You see, there are some things
that are very hard to explain, Alice...

21:36.441 --> 21:39.409
and as soon as I...

21:39.444 --> 21:41.945
Yes, Alice.

21:41.980 --> 21:45.481
Now, Alice,
before we're married this afternoon...

21:45.516 --> 21:47.483
there's one thing we must have clear.

21:47.518 --> 21:51.487
I don't want any woman interfering
with my affairs. It's fatal.

21:51.522 --> 21:53.021
That's the stuff, buddy.

21:53.056 --> 21:54.856
- What do you want?
- Dr. Huxley?

21:54.891 --> 21:56.057
Sign here.

21:56.092 --> 22:00.050
Just a minute, Alice.
I have to sign something.

22:01.796 --> 22:03.264
Alice, it's arrived!

22:03.299 --> 22:06.166
The intercostal clavicle.
Yes, isn't that wonderful?

22:06.201 --> 22:08.969
Isn't that a marvelous wedding present?
Thank you.

22:09.004 --> 22:11.204
You see, I'm going to be married
this afternoon.

22:11.239 --> 22:13.373
Don't let it throw you, buddy.

22:13.408 --> 22:17.176
Yes, Alice. Yes, isn't it great?

22:17.211 --> 22:19.011
Alice, I'm so excited.

22:19.046 --> 22:21.914
I'll tell you what you do.
You go on down to the museum...

22:21.949 --> 22:25.906
and I'll meet you there right away.
Goodbye.

22:34.325 --> 22:37.961
Hello. Oh, it's you.

22:37.996 --> 22:40.864
I can't hear very well.
Come closer to the telephone.

22:40.899 --> 22:43.967
I said, "Good morning, David."
Do you want a leopard?

22:44.002 --> 22:46.302
Why should I want a leopard?

22:46.337 --> 22:48.805
For that matter, why should I?
But I've got one.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.008
- Where would you get a leopard?
- I wouldn't get a leopard.

22:52.043 --> 22:55.545
My brother Mark got him.
He's hunting in Brazil and he caught him.

22:55.580 --> 22:57.913
Of course. It's a stuffed leopard.

22:57.948 --> 23:01.906
Of course. Why should my brother
be hunting stuffed leopards in Brazil...

23:02.851 --> 23:06.844
when he can find them right here
in New York?

23:09.523 --> 23:13.516
David, it's lucky I met you yesterday,
because you're the only zoologist I know.

23:16.263 --> 23:18.865
Of course I know what a zoologist is.

23:18.900 --> 23:21.301
Get out of here. No, not you, David.

23:21.336 --> 23:25.294
Baby, get back into that bathroom.
You're making a nuisance of yourself.

23:25.939 --> 23:29.931
No, not you, David.
No, I want you to come right over.

23:30.008 --> 23:32.978
David, don't be irrelevant.
The point is, I have a leopard.

23:33.013 --> 23:35.147
The question is,
what am I going to do with it?

23:35.182 --> 23:38.517
Susan, I regret to say
the leopard is your problem.

23:38.552 --> 23:41.519
You mean you refuse to help me?
David, you can't do that.

23:41.554 --> 23:45.512
You can't leave me alone with a leopard.
I'll come and get you in my...

23:47.358 --> 23:49.860
Susan! What happened?

23:49.895 --> 23:50.927
Is it the leopard?

23:50.962 --> 23:54.364
No. Nothing happened to me, David,
I just...

23:54.399 --> 23:56.900
I mean, the leopard!

23:56.935 --> 23:59.669
David, the leopard!

23:59.704 --> 24:03.661
Can you hear me, Susan?

24:09.879 --> 24:12.380
Susan, be brave! I'll be right there!

24:12.415 --> 24:16.351
Hold on there, Susan!
Susan! Can you hear me?

24:16.386 --> 24:20.344
I'll be there, Susan!

24:41.340 --> 24:44.509
- You're all right.
- Yes, I'm all right.

24:44.544 --> 24:46.678
- You lied to me!
- No. Just a little.

24:46.713 --> 24:48.914
Telling me a ridiculous story
about a leopard.

24:48.949 --> 24:51.082
- I have a leopard. Right in there.
- Where is it?

24:51.117 --> 24:53.417
- I don't believe you.
- But you have to believe me.

24:53.452 --> 24:56.387
I've been the victim
of your unbridled imagination once more.

24:56.422 --> 25:00.380
Chasing all the way...

25:00.724 --> 25:03.927
That'll teach you to go around
saying things about people.

25:03.962 --> 25:05.929
You've got to get out of this apartment.

25:05.964 --> 25:07.463
But I can't. I have a lease.

25:07.498 --> 25:09.465
You've got to get that thing out of here.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.968
Don't worry, he's all right.
What are you gonna do?

25:12.003 --> 25:13.202
- Call the zoo.
- You can't!

25:13.237 --> 25:17.105
That's the meanest thing I ever heard.
He's a pet, he'd be miserable in a zoo.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.507
Listen. From my brother Mark:

25:18.542 --> 25:20.943
"Dear Susan, I'm sending you Baby."
That's Baby.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.711
"Guard him with your life.

25:22.746 --> 25:25.646
"He's three years old, gentle,
and he likes dogs."

25:25.681 --> 25:29.583
I don't know whether that means he eats
dogs or is fond of them. Mark's so vague.

25:29.618 --> 25:33.120
<i>"He also likes that song, I Can't Give You
Anything but Love, Baby. "</i>

25:33.155 --> 25:36.289
- That's absurd!
- No, it isn't, really. Listen.

25:36.324 --> 25:39.159
This is probably the silliest thing
that ever happened to me.

25:39.194 --> 25:42.028
It's silly but true.
He absolutely adores the tune.

25:42.063 --> 25:43.496
What's the difference?

25:43.531 --> 25:47.488
It's silly that he likes such an old tune.
I imagine that down in Brazil...

25:48.300 --> 25:50.769
- Stop this, Susan.
- Let me show him to you.

25:50.804 --> 25:54.762
Don't go near the door! Dear, dear.

25:55.974 --> 25:59.477
Watch, David.
He'll go right toward the music.

25:59.512 --> 26:02.313
Look at that. Isn't this remarkable?

26:02.348 --> 26:03.715
It loves it, David.

26:03.750 --> 26:07.217
If we put the Victrola in the bathroom,
will it go back in?

26:07.252 --> 26:11.210
Yes, but the music sounds better out here.
Besides, he likes it.

26:11.555 --> 26:13.023
Here it comes.

26:13.058 --> 26:17.015
Now go away! Please go away!

26:18.027 --> 26:20.196
I'm gonna get out of here.

26:20.231 --> 26:21.664
Susan, I don't like leopards.

26:21.699 --> 26:24.667
- Just think of him as a house cat.
- I don't like cats either.

26:24.702 --> 26:27.702
- Stand still. Don't be nervous.
- Make him stand still!

26:27.737 --> 26:31.072
Don't be silly.
You can't make a leopard stand still.

26:31.107 --> 26:33.775
Do something. Turn off that Victrola.

26:33.810 --> 26:37.112
I don't think it's the
music. I think it's you.

26:37.147 --> 26:41.104
I think you've found a real friend.
Isn't it affectionate, like a baby kitten?

26:41.281 --> 26:45.152
I never saw anything take such a liking
to anyone. It'd follow you anywhere.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.321
We'll have no trouble
taking it to Connecticut.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.222
My farm in Westlake, Connecticut.

26:49.257 --> 26:51.524
I'm not going to Westlake, Connecticut.

26:51.559 --> 26:54.360
I will not be involved
in any more harebrained schemes.

26:54.395 --> 26:57.563
Imagine Aunt Elizabeth coming here
and running smack into a leopard.

26:57.598 --> 26:59.531
That would be an end to my $1 million.

26:59.566 --> 27:03.535
If you had an aunt who was going to give
you $1 million and she found a leopard...

27:03.570 --> 27:06.071
- in your apartment, what would you do?
- I don't know.

27:06.106 --> 27:07.239
You have to help me.

27:07.274 --> 27:11.231
There are only two things I have to do,
finish my brontosaurus and get married.

27:12.643 --> 27:14.445
Go on, quitter.

27:14.480 --> 27:18.438
It's no good calling me names,
because I won't argue with you anymore.

27:18.516 --> 27:22.508
I don't want anything to do with a leopard.

27:24.487 --> 27:28.480
Go on, Baby, down the stairs.

27:44.372 --> 27:48.365
Good morning.

27:57.684 --> 28:01.488
- Good morning, Professor.
- Good morning.

28:01.523 --> 28:04.623
You'd better change your mind
about coming to Connecticut.

28:04.658 --> 28:07.893
Susan, we settled that question
once and for all.

28:07.928 --> 28:10.729
But what about my leopard?

28:10.764 --> 28:12.364
That's your problem.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.265
It's not all my problem.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.367
Susan, will you please go away?

28:16.402 --> 28:20.360
All right. Since he likes you so much,
I've decided to give him to you.

28:20.405 --> 28:22.340
I won't take him.

28:22.375 --> 28:26.332
You've got him.

28:29.146 --> 28:32.483
Don't go away! I've got the leopard!

28:32.518 --> 28:33.816
Oh, dear, look at that.

28:33.851 --> 28:36.819
No, David,
all I was doing was driving along.

28:36.854 --> 28:40.323
You were standing on the sidewalk yelling,
and looking very silly.

28:40.358 --> 28:43.726
You know very well
you tricked me into this trip.

28:43.761 --> 28:47.295
Look. Eating your car.

28:47.330 --> 28:50.265
Look at the road!

28:50.300 --> 28:52.901
I have a feeling
something horrible is going to happen.

28:52.936 --> 28:55.536
Everything's going to be all right.

28:55.571 --> 28:59.529
I don't care anymore.

29:00.674 --> 29:03.177
Hello. What's the matter,
did you get lonely?

29:03.212 --> 29:05.945
Susan, if you know any shortcuts,
please take them.

29:05.980 --> 29:07.947
We'll be there in no time.

29:07.982 --> 29:11.584
I just want to deliver this leopard,
take the first train back to town...

29:11.619 --> 29:13.720
and forget
the last 24 hours ever happened.

29:13.755 --> 29:17.689
Now, what's wrong with the last 24 hours?
I've had a wonderful time.

29:17.724 --> 29:21.193
Susan, I don't know.
You look at everything upside down.

29:21.228 --> 29:23.195
I've never known anyone quite like you.

29:23.230 --> 29:25.164
You've just had a bad day, that's all.

29:25.199 --> 29:27.465
That's a masterpiece of understatement.

29:27.500 --> 29:30.635
Look, I can't discuss anything with you...

29:30.670 --> 29:34.205
with Baby breathing
down the back of my neck.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.197
Get down. Go on. Now lie down.

29:39.209 --> 29:43.202
Susan, duck!

29:56.225 --> 29:58.793
Never hang on to a leopard's tail!

29:58.828 --> 30:02.786
Sing, David!

30:10.804 --> 30:14.575
Anyway, I still insist that he was
right in the middle of the road.

30:14.610 --> 30:17.311
I've never hit anything
that was in the right place.

30:17.346 --> 30:19.412
That wagon was on the side of the road.

30:19.447 --> 30:21.747
It was straight ahead of me.
That's why I hit it.

30:21.782 --> 30:24.784
- What time is it?
- We'll be there in no time.

30:24.819 --> 30:28.777
We just have to stop at Westlake
and get some meat for Baby.

30:29.521 --> 30:32.390
Why, he's already had an assortment
of ducks and chickens.

30:32.425 --> 30:34.226
Not to mention a couple of swans.

30:34.261 --> 30:35.660
All feathers.

30:35.695 --> 30:37.395
Yeah, very expensive feathers.

30:37.430 --> 30:40.831
I don't see how any pair of swans
could cost $150. That was a gyp.

30:40.866 --> 30:44.668
If you'd run, as I told you to,
we shouldn't have had to pay for them.

30:44.703 --> 30:47.938
Susan, when a man is wrestling a leopard
in the middle of a pond...

30:47.973 --> 30:51.930
he's in no position to run.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.974
There it is, David. Please hurry up.

31:06.355 --> 31:08.924
Why, of all places,
when you have a leopard in the car...

31:08.959 --> 31:11.026
did you stop in a town
where there's a circus?

31:11.061 --> 31:14.929
I didn't stop because there's a circus,
but Baby's going to be hungry.

31:14.964 --> 31:17.865
Please hurry.
If Baby wakes up, we'll be in trouble.

31:17.900 --> 31:21.858
I don't suppose it will make any difference,
but you're parked in front of a fireplug.

31:22.069 --> 31:26.061
I know it. Don't worry.
I'll take care of everything. You go ahead.

31:31.611 --> 31:33.445
50, $1.00. Thank you.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.813
Yes. What can I do for you?

31:34.848 --> 31:37.716
I want 30 pounds of sirloin steak, please.

31:37.751 --> 31:39.518
Did you say 30 pounds?

31:39.553 --> 31:42.855
- Yes, that's right, 30 pounds.
- How will you have it cut?

31:42.890 --> 31:45.690
- Just in one piece.
- You going to roast it or broil it?

31:45.725 --> 31:49.683
- It's going to be eaten raw.
- Yeah.

31:58.702 --> 32:02.695
Hey, lady. That's a fireplug.

32:02.839 --> 32:04.041
I know it.

32:04.076 --> 32:08.033
- It's against the law to park alongside one.
- I know it.

32:08.678 --> 32:11.847
- Come here.
- Who, me? Why?

32:11.882 --> 32:15.684
I am Constable Slocum.

32:15.719 --> 32:17.519
Is that so?

32:17.554 --> 32:20.522
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do?

32:20.557 --> 32:24.515
I don't care who you are, I just want you
to know you can't park beside a fireplug.

32:24.759 --> 32:27.895
- I was just watching the parade.
- You were?

32:27.930 --> 32:29.863
I suppose you get free seats to the circus.

32:29.898 --> 32:33.033
Elmer and I usually get a...
That has nothing to do with it.

32:33.068 --> 32:34.835
I'm just going to give you a ticket.

32:34.870 --> 32:37.537
Thank you very much.
I'd love to go to the circus...

32:37.572 --> 32:40.373
but you better keep your tickets
because I'm busy tonight.

32:40.408 --> 32:44.366
Yeah? Well, it ain't that kind of a ticket.

32:45.478 --> 32:46.545
Jeepers.

32:46.580 --> 32:49.748
Young lady, it might interest you
to know that you're under arrest.

32:49.783 --> 32:51.817
Oh, well. I mean, why?

32:51.852 --> 32:54.353
For parking alongside of a fireplug.

32:54.388 --> 32:57.054
I'm not parked next to a fireplug.

32:57.089 --> 32:59.724
Yeah? What do you call that?

32:59.759 --> 33:02.960
You mean that you think
that this is my car?

33:02.995 --> 33:04.028
Ain't it?

33:04.063 --> 33:06.063
No. That's my car.

33:06.098 --> 33:08.565
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

33:08.600 --> 33:12.558
You didn't ask me.

33:14.404 --> 33:17.507
Say, do you grind this up
before you eat it?

33:17.542 --> 33:20.075
This isn't for me. It's for Baby.

33:20.110 --> 33:24.068
For who?

33:24.913 --> 33:26.148
Hurry up, Baby. Get in!

33:26.183 --> 33:27.616
- But...
- Jump on!

33:27.651 --> 33:29.083
That isn't your car!

33:29.118 --> 33:32.420
No, but it's my leopard!

33:32.455 --> 33:35.523
- Wait a minute! That's my car!
- What are you yelling about?

33:35.558 --> 33:39.059
They stole my car. Last night,
she tried to steal my wife's purse.

33:39.094 --> 33:41.895
Don't stand there.
Do something! Catch them!

33:41.930 --> 33:44.498
Well, Elmer, bless me. Bring back that car!

33:46.199 --> 33:50.202
<i>- I'm glad we finally got here
- Isn't it wonderful?</i>

33:50.237 --> 33:53.172
<i>We could put him in that box
Wait, don't open the door</i>

33:53.207 --> 33:56.909
<i>- until you close those
- I think that is a good idea, too</i>

33:56.944 --> 34:00.211
<i>I hope he won't get out</i>

34:00.246 --> 34:02.680
<i>Stand by that door, and I'll open this one</i>

34:02.715 --> 34:05.517
<i>He'll just walk along, I hope</i>

34:05.552 --> 34:08.152
<i>Come on, Baby. Go on</i>

34:08.188 --> 34:10.721
<i>In the stall, Baby</i>

34:10.755 --> 34:13.857
<i>Come on, baby,
right in there, right in there</i>

34:13.891 --> 34:15.859
<i>Right in there</i>

34:15.893 --> 34:19.062
<i>Now everything is quite all right</i>

34:19.097 --> 34:21.597
<i>No, everything is not all</i>

34:21.632 --> 34:25.590
Everything is not all right, Susan. Maybe
for you, but I've got to get to New York.

34:26.068 --> 34:29.938
Now one thing's settled,
you start worrying about something else.

34:29.974 --> 34:33.775
One of us should worry!
On top of all this, we've stolen a car!

34:33.810 --> 34:36.678
That's all right.
I'll send it back. I don't like it, anyway.

34:36.713 --> 34:40.081
I suppose you'd like me to leave it
with the constable on my way back.

34:40.116 --> 34:42.817
No, you might be arrested.
Besides, it's a hot car.

34:42.851 --> 34:45.152
You're going to file
the numbers off the engine.

34:45.187 --> 34:48.621
No, I'll have the gardener take it back
after it's dark.

34:48.657 --> 34:50.458
- Stop it!
- You're shedding.

34:50.493 --> 34:52.025
Now, where's the telephone?

34:52.061 --> 34:54.260
- Out that door.
- That's all I want to know.

34:54.295 --> 34:55.895
What I want to suggest is...

34:55.929 --> 34:59.599
I don't want any more suggestions
from you. My fiancée is waiting for me.

34:59.634 --> 35:02.001
In order to get married,
I have to get to New York.

35:02.036 --> 35:04.837
I want you to be married,
I think you should be married.

35:04.872 --> 35:08.740
I think every man should be. But I
don't think any girl will marry you...

35:08.775 --> 35:10.776
- looking the way you do.
- Where's the phone?

35:10.811 --> 35:13.712
- In there, but look at yourself.
- What's the matter with me?

35:13.747 --> 35:14.912
I am dirty, aren't I?

35:14.947 --> 35:17.148
You see? What I want to suggest is...

35:17.183 --> 35:19.784
The only way I'll follow
another of your suggestions...

35:19.819 --> 35:22.920
is if you hold a bright object
in front of my eyes and twirl it.

35:22.955 --> 35:25.121
I understand. I simply wanted to suggest...

35:25.156 --> 35:27.958
I don't want any suggestions.
I just want to clean up.

35:27.993 --> 35:29.292
Where is there a shower?

35:29.327 --> 35:33.285
That's what I was going to suggest,
a shower.

35:54.716 --> 35:57.284
- Hannah.
- Yes, Miss Susan?

35:57.319 --> 36:00.020
Send these into town
and have them cleaned and pressed.

36:00.055 --> 36:03.123
- Why? I can do them here.
- Don't argue with me, Hannah.

36:03.158 --> 36:05.058
Into town.
Have them cleaned and pressed.

36:05.093 --> 36:07.226
It'll take a lot longer.

36:07.261 --> 36:11.219
There's no hurry, no hurry at all.

36:18.069 --> 36:22.062
- Hurry up, David.
- I am hurrying.

36:24.009 --> 36:25.777
- David.
- What?

36:25.812 --> 36:28.679
- What's in the box?
- What did you say?

36:28.714 --> 36:32.616
That's the intercostal clavicle
of a brontosaurus.

36:32.651 --> 36:34.018
Really?

36:34.053 --> 36:36.020
It's just an old bone.

36:36.055 --> 36:38.121
Yes, it's just an old bone.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.123
Put it down gently and go away.

36:40.158 --> 36:43.626
All right.
Is there anything else I can do for you?

36:43.661 --> 36:45.762
Hand me my clothes, will you?

36:45.797 --> 36:47.797
They aren't here. They're being pressed.

36:47.832 --> 36:50.866
- What?
- The gardener's taken them into town.

36:50.901 --> 36:53.869
For what? Stop him. I can't wait.
I must leave immediately.

36:53.904 --> 36:55.337
You can't leave without clothes.

36:55.372 --> 36:58.206
I know that. Where are you going?

36:58.241 --> 37:00.207
I'm going to take a shower.

37:00.242 --> 37:02.343
Susan! Don't leave me here like this!

37:02.378 --> 37:04.245
Don't be impatient, David.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.949
We'll talk it over after I've finished.
Everything's going to be all right.

37:07.984 --> 37:10.083
"Everything's going to be all right."

37:10.118 --> 37:12.218
Certainly, everything's going
to be all right.

37:12.253 --> 37:16.089
Everything's going to be...
I'm losing my mind, that's all.

37:16.124 --> 37:18.892
Roaming around Connecticut
without any clothes on.

37:18.927 --> 37:22.227
I don't believe it. How can all these
things happen to just one person?

37:22.262 --> 37:26.098
Susan, where are you?

37:26.133 --> 37:29.935
Will you come out and help me find some
clothes or must I come in and get you?

37:29.970 --> 37:31.135
You wouldn't.

37:31.170 --> 37:33.237
Yes, I would!

37:33.272 --> 37:35.406
Maybe I wouldn't.

37:35.441 --> 37:38.076
- Susan, where's the gardener's room?
- Why?

37:38.111 --> 37:41.645
- Because he must have some clothes.
- What? I can't hear you.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.815
- You can hear what you want to hear!
- What did you say?

37:44.850 --> 37:48.652
I just said... Never mind.
I'll find the place myself.

37:48.687 --> 37:50.954
The gardener must have clothes.
Clothes are clothes.

37:50.989 --> 37:52.254
The gardener's in town.

37:52.289 --> 37:54.624
He couldn't have taken all his clothes
with him!

37:54.659 --> 37:55.691
Yes, he could.

37:55.726 --> 37:58.427
Of all the conceited,
spoiled little scatterbrains.

37:58.462 --> 38:01.797
My goodness, the man who gets...

38:01.832 --> 38:04.766
The man who gets you
is gonna have a lifetime of misery!

38:04.801 --> 38:07.235
"Everything's going to be all right."

38:07.270 --> 38:08.737
What do you want?

38:08.772 --> 38:10.772
Who are you?

38:10.807 --> 38:12.773
- Who are you?
- What do you want?

38:12.808 --> 38:14.441
Who are you?

38:14.476 --> 38:16.944
I don't know. I'm not quite myself today.

38:16.979 --> 38:19.446
You look perfectly
idiotic in those clothes.

38:19.481 --> 38:21.348
These aren't my clothes.

38:21.383 --> 38:23.816
Where are your clothes?

38:23.851 --> 38:25.251
I've lost my clothes.

38:25.286 --> 38:27.720
But why are you wearing these clothes?

38:27.755 --> 38:31.713
Because I just went gay all of a sudden!
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

38:31.924 --> 38:35.916
Now, young man. Stop this nonsense.
What are you doing?

38:36.762 --> 38:40.755
I'm sitting in the middle of 42nd Street
waiting for a bus.

38:45.202 --> 38:49.106
Go away!

38:49.141 --> 38:51.375
- Who is this man?
- I don't know.

38:51.410 --> 38:55.367
- Stop it, George! What's he doing here?
- I don't know.

38:56.079 --> 39:00.072
Susan, come back here. Stop it, George!

39:00.116 --> 39:04.109
Aunt Elizabeth, it's you!
I've never been so thrilled in my life.

39:04.854 --> 39:08.357
This is amazing to see you here,
and George dear.

39:08.392 --> 39:11.760
- What made you come out here?
- Quiet, George!

39:11.795 --> 39:15.753
Now, stop gushing
and tell me, who is this man?

39:17.165 --> 39:19.300
- Where'd you get him?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

39:19.335 --> 39:21.169
- What's he doing here?
- Susan brought me.

39:21.204 --> 39:22.770
I don't doubt it, but why?

39:22.805 --> 39:23.838
I got a letter from Mark.

39:23.873 --> 39:27.830
He said David was an old friend of his.
He'd been working very hard in town...

39:28.141 --> 39:31.244
and was on the point
of having a nervous breakdown.

39:31.279 --> 39:32.312
I'm a nut from Brazil.

39:32.347 --> 39:34.915
He's very excitable.
We let him do whatever he wants.

39:34.950 --> 39:37.516
- Where are his clothes?
- Susan took them.

39:37.551 --> 39:40.820
- What's he doing in that thing?
- Mark said he should be allowed...

39:40.855 --> 39:44.156
to wear a negligee. No telling what'll
happen if he's not allowed to.

39:44.191 --> 39:45.791
Does he want to wear those clothes?

39:45.826 --> 39:49.783
No, I don't want to wear this thing.
I just want to get married!

39:49.828 --> 39:53.821
Susan, I forbid it!
I absolutely put my foot down. The idea!

40:06.376 --> 40:08.078
- Quiet!
- Please listen to me!

40:08.113 --> 40:12.070
- Quiet!
- Don't talk so much.

40:16.085 --> 40:18.387
Perhaps you could help me.

40:18.422 --> 40:22.023
Perhaps you could help me
find some clothes.

40:22.058 --> 40:23.558
Why, yes.

40:23.593 --> 40:27.562
There must be some of Mark's things
around somewhere.

40:27.597 --> 40:29.930
- Aren't there some...
- Are there?

40:29.965 --> 40:32.566
Well...

40:32.601 --> 40:35.836
Yes. There are some
in Mr. Mark's room, sir.

40:35.871 --> 40:39.440
- Yes, sir.
- Which is Mr. Mark's room?

40:39.475 --> 40:41.941
It's the end, sir. Yes, sir.

40:41.976 --> 40:45.934
Thank you.

40:47.280 --> 40:51.272
Go away.

40:57.289 --> 41:01.026
He loves me. He loves me not.

41:01.061 --> 41:03.127
David! Where'd he go?

41:03.162 --> 41:04.529
He went to get some clothes.

41:04.564 --> 41:08.522
If he gets clothes, he'll go away.
He's the only man I've ever loved.

41:08.833 --> 41:11.302
David! What will I do without David?

41:11.337 --> 41:15.294
Stop. Get away from me.

41:18.909 --> 41:22.901
George, please be quiet.

41:40.161 --> 41:41.529
- David?
- What?

41:41.564 --> 41:44.131
- Can I come in?
- I don't care what you do!

41:44.166 --> 41:48.124
- Thanks. Where are you?
- Here I am. What do you want?

41:48.168 --> 41:49.236
Go on and laugh.

41:49.271 --> 41:51.839
I know it looks ridiculous,
but I'm past caring.

41:51.874 --> 41:53.440
What are you going to do?

41:53.475 --> 41:56.075
What I've been trying to do,
get back to New York!

41:56.110 --> 41:58.144
You can't go dressed that way.

41:58.179 --> 42:01.214
They're all I could find,
and clothes are clothes. I'm going.

42:01.249 --> 42:02.481
I'm going back to New York...

42:02.516 --> 42:06.151
if only to repair the damage
that's been done since I've known you.

42:06.186 --> 42:09.654
The damage to Miss Swallow,
the museum, Mr. Peabody and everybody...

42:09.689 --> 42:11.990
Mr. Peabody? But, David...

42:12.025 --> 42:15.059
the one way to get to Mr. Peabody
is through Aunt Elizabeth.

42:15.094 --> 42:18.329
Please listen for one second.
He'll do anything she tells him to.

42:18.364 --> 42:21.198
He'll even like you.
He's Aunt Elizabeth's lawyer.

42:21.233 --> 42:24.668
He's her lawyer. Mr. Peabody.

42:24.703 --> 42:27.036
- What's your aunt's name?
- Elizabeth.

42:27.071 --> 42:28.905
- But she has another name.
- Of course.

42:28.940 --> 42:30.340
Never mind. Don't tell me.

42:30.375 --> 42:33.243
Why not? It's Random.
Mrs. Carleton Random.

42:33.278 --> 42:36.378
- Yes, I know. I knew that was coming.
- What's the matter?

42:36.413 --> 42:40.371
Out of seven million people,
why did I have to run into you yesterday?

42:41.550 --> 42:43.285
What have I done?

42:43.320 --> 42:47.221
Susan, Mrs. Random is going
to give away $1 million.

42:47.256 --> 42:48.623
I know.

42:48.658 --> 42:52.616
I wanted it for the museum.

42:53.895 --> 42:57.887
I'm afraid you've made a rather
unfavorable impression on Aunt Elizabeth.

42:58.231 --> 43:01.935
I quite realize that.

43:01.970 --> 43:03.904
- Susan, listen to me.
- What?

43:03.939 --> 43:07.706
A lot of things have happened but
we'll forget them because this is serious.

43:07.741 --> 43:09.341
What, David?

43:09.376 --> 43:13.334
Can you concentrate for just a moment?
There's only one thing to be done.

43:14.079 --> 43:17.082
And this is important to me
and to my work.

43:17.117 --> 43:18.149
What?

43:18.184 --> 43:22.086
You're so good-looking
without your glasses.

43:22.121 --> 43:24.989
- Listen to me. Try and remember.
- What?

43:25.024 --> 43:27.692
I've made a horrible mess of things.

43:27.727 --> 43:31.684
Your aunt must never find out who I am.
You do understand, don't you?

43:31.962 --> 43:33.563
Yes, David.

43:33.598 --> 43:37.134
You can tell her that I'm Mark's friend
and I have bats in the belfry...

43:37.169 --> 43:40.436
but don't ever tell her my name.
Can you remember that?

43:40.471 --> 43:42.338
- Yes, David.
- You're sure?

43:42.373 --> 43:46.331
Yes, David. But you are good-looking
without your glasses.

43:47.109 --> 43:48.477
Never mind, Susan.

43:48.512 --> 43:50.578
What did I say?

43:50.613 --> 43:54.482
What did I do? What did I say?

43:54.517 --> 43:56.952
- What did I do?
- I just asked you to remember...

43:56.987 --> 43:59.454
- I swear I'll remember...
- Where is it?

43:59.489 --> 44:02.122
- I know exactly what you told me to say.
- Where is it?

44:02.157 --> 44:03.157
Where's what?

44:03.192 --> 44:05.359
- My intercostal clavicle.
- Your what?

44:05.394 --> 44:08.562
My bone. It's rare. It's precious.
What did you do with it?

44:08.597 --> 44:09.964
Your bone?

44:09.999 --> 44:12.432
- You had it. Give it to me.
- I haven't got it.

44:12.467 --> 44:16.202
- Did you carry it somewhere?
- Why would I carry a bone around?

44:16.237 --> 44:19.305
I wouldn't dare give a reason
for anything you do.

44:19.340 --> 44:22.140
I guess you'll have to find another one.

44:22.175 --> 44:25.143
It took three expeditions
and five years to find that one!

44:25.178 --> 44:29.147
Now that they know where to find one,
couldn't you send them back for another?

44:29.182 --> 44:31.782
Susan, you had it.
You took it out of the box.

44:31.817 --> 44:34.752
- Where did you put it?
- I put it back in the box.

44:34.787 --> 44:38.745
- Was there somebody else in the room?
- There was nobody else, but...

44:39.423 --> 44:40.992
- George.
- Who's George?

44:41.027 --> 44:44.984
The dog. Don't you see? Dog, bone.

44:47.163 --> 44:51.156
- George!
- George!

44:51.601 --> 44:53.369
Stop it! You sound like an echo.

44:53.404 --> 44:57.362
- George!
- Nice George.

44:59.008 --> 45:00.109
Did you see him?

45:00.144 --> 45:01.310
- See who?
- George.

45:01.345 --> 45:03.345
Are those the only clothes you could find?

45:03.379 --> 45:06.347
Come back here this minute.
What are you doing?

45:06.382 --> 45:07.515
- Hunting for George.
- Why?

45:07.550 --> 45:10.184
David wants him.
David thinks he's such a nice dog.

45:10.219 --> 45:11.786
George? He's a fiend, and you know it.

45:11.821 --> 45:15.778
- But David doesn't.
- Come here!

45:20.327 --> 45:24.320
He's definitely not in the house.
That's settled.

45:25.331 --> 45:28.634
Don't do that. He knows you want him.
He'll hide.

45:28.669 --> 45:30.603
Susan, where's he apt to go?

45:30.638 --> 45:34.306
- George is apt to go anywhere.
- No. Where does he hide things?

45:34.341 --> 45:37.042
- How can I tell?
- You ought to know.

45:37.077 --> 45:40.412
There he is! George!

45:40.447 --> 45:43.515
My goodness, look at his nose.
He's been digging. He's buried it.

45:43.550 --> 45:45.716
There are 26 acres in this garden.

45:45.751 --> 45:49.319
That's awful.
George, where did you hide that bone?

45:49.354 --> 45:53.290
No, David, not that way.
Now, George, we're not angry.

45:53.325 --> 45:55.325
David and Susan need that bone.

45:55.360 --> 45:58.194
It's a nasty old bone,
it's hundreds of years old.

45:58.229 --> 46:00.863
That's David's bone.

46:00.898 --> 46:04.734
Susan will get you a nice, fresh bone
if you'll show us where it is.

46:04.769 --> 46:08.170
- Look at the nasty little cur!
- You'll ruin everything. Spell it.

46:08.205 --> 46:11.339
George, don't be stubborn.
Susan loves you.

46:11.374 --> 46:14.676
Where'd you put it? Don't you remember?
Where'd you dig?

46:14.711 --> 46:18.668
He's not paying attention... George!

46:19.080 --> 46:21.248
It's easy if you know how to handle him.

46:21.283 --> 46:24.652
Everything's going to be all right.
This must be the spot.

46:24.687 --> 46:28.644
He's going to start digging in a minute.
That's right, George.

46:29.189 --> 46:33.182
- It's very simple if you keep your head.
- I do hope he doesn't hurt that bone.

46:33.626 --> 46:36.196
Isn't he a strong little man, David?

46:36.231 --> 46:38.797
He's got something! Come on, dig.

46:38.832 --> 46:41.133
- Dig.
- I'm digging.

46:41.168 --> 46:43.135
I feel something!

46:43.170 --> 46:45.604
I hope it isn't hurt.

46:45.639 --> 46:47.739
Look, David, a boot.

46:47.774 --> 46:50.274
- A boot.
- Don't hit George, David.

46:50.309 --> 46:51.809
I wasn't going to hit George.

46:51.844 --> 46:54.812
George, that was fine,
but you've got to concentrate again.

46:54.847 --> 46:58.805
David has to find his bone.
No. Not in there.

46:59.516 --> 47:03.353
- Isn't this fun? Just like a game.
- Yes.

47:03.388 --> 47:06.556
George, if you get tired of digging
you just tell David and Susan...

47:06.591 --> 47:10.548
where you hid it, and they'll dig.

47:10.893 --> 47:14.463
Susan, do you think
George is really trying?

47:14.498 --> 47:17.800
Almost every place he's taken us,
we've found something.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.635
- There's nothing here.
- Look, David, another boot.

47:20.670 --> 47:23.204
Another boot. That makes three pairs.

47:23.239 --> 47:25.340
Come on, George, quit stalling.
Where is it?

47:25.375 --> 47:27.408
Don't be discouraged.

47:27.443 --> 47:29.911
George, concentrate. Bones, not boots.

47:29.946 --> 47:31.845
- There he goes.
- See? He's got the idea.

47:31.880 --> 47:35.838
- I'm getting tired of all this digging.
- Yes, what we need is a plow.

47:37.251 --> 47:39.686
- Susan?
- Jeepers, it's Aunt Elizabeth.

47:39.721 --> 47:43.489
Follow him, David, don't let him get away!

47:43.524 --> 47:45.324
Yes, Aunty, I'm coming.

47:45.359 --> 47:49.317
Susan, what on earth are you doing?
What are all these?

47:49.529 --> 47:51.230
Those? They're holes.

47:51.265 --> 47:54.332
I can see they're holes.
How did they get here?

47:54.367 --> 47:57.335
David and George and I were digging.

47:57.370 --> 48:00.172
- Who is this David?
- He's a friend of Mark's.

48:00.207 --> 48:03.307
- Is that all you know about him?
- I know I'm going to marry him.

48:03.342 --> 48:04.675
He doesn't know it, but I am.

48:04.710 --> 48:07.678
If you're planning to marry him
on my money, you're mistaken.

48:07.713 --> 48:10.481
I don't want another lunatic in my family,
I've got enough.

48:10.516 --> 48:12.716
When are you going to marry him?
What's his name?

48:12.751 --> 48:15.351
It's Bone.

48:15.386 --> 48:16.986
- Bones?
- One Bone.

48:17.021 --> 48:20.979
One bone or two, it's a ridiculous name.
What does he do?

48:21.724 --> 48:22.759
He hunts.

48:22.794 --> 48:24.893
Hunts? Hunts what?

48:24.928 --> 48:26.895
Well, animals, I should think.

48:26.930 --> 48:29.498
- Big-game hunting?
- Yes. Very big.

48:29.533 --> 48:33.435
You call that big-game hunting?

48:33.470 --> 48:34.869
Look at that.

48:34.904 --> 48:36.671
Aunty, he's just playing with George.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.706
He won't play with George
another minute.

48:38.741 --> 48:42.699
Tell him dinner's at 8:30 sharp.
George, come here this minute!

48:44.378 --> 48:48.370
Come along, George.

48:52.285 --> 48:55.321
Yes, Alice, I am in Connecticut,
but I can't get in...

48:55.356 --> 48:59.314
because I've been unavoidably detained.

49:00.392 --> 49:02.861
David, listen.

49:02.896 --> 49:04.630
I can't hear you. I'm talking.

49:04.665 --> 49:08.622
Go away. I'll be with you
as soon as I'm finished.

49:13.638 --> 49:15.673
Now, David, you have to listen to me.

49:15.708 --> 49:18.709
Yes, I know that...

49:18.744 --> 49:20.944
Susan, will you please get off the phone?

49:20.979 --> 49:24.937
David, it's about the leopard.
He's making the most terrific rumpus.

49:25.616 --> 49:29.352
- He's hungry. We've got to feed him.
- I can't help that.

49:29.387 --> 49:31.654
What, Alice, dear?
No, it's somebody on the line.

49:31.689 --> 49:34.423
- Keep quiet, Susan.
- You've got to help. This can't wait.

49:34.458 --> 49:36.425
If the people in this house hear him...

49:36.460 --> 49:38.493
they'll think something terrible
has happened.

49:38.528 --> 49:42.030
Susan, get off the line, please...
Hello, Alice.

49:42.065 --> 49:46.023
What? I don't know what time it is!

49:48.435 --> 49:52.428
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:37 and one quarter.

49:53.407 --> 49:54.975
Susan, please!

49:55.010 --> 49:56.777
Alice, I can't hear you.

49:56.812 --> 50:00.769
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:40.

50:02.382 --> 50:06.375
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:40 and one half.

50:08.354 --> 50:11.657
When you hear the tone,
the time will be 7:41.

50:11.692 --> 50:13.859
Pardon me. The time is 8:10.

50:13.894 --> 50:15.927
When you hear the tone, the time will be...

50:15.962 --> 50:19.919
No. My watch shows 8:10 and a quarter.

50:19.964 --> 50:21.032
Who are you?

50:21.067 --> 50:25.025
Who am I? I'm 8:10...
I'm Major Horace Applegate.

50:27.705 --> 50:30.607
- What do you want?
- Mrs. Random invited me for dinner.

50:30.642 --> 50:33.443
Would you please find out
if she still wants me?

50:33.478 --> 50:35.011
She's hung up.

50:35.046 --> 50:36.846
So am I.

50:36.881 --> 50:40.838
Why, Horace, what are you doing?
Are you coming in or going out?

50:41.684 --> 50:43.452
He's coming in to dinner.

50:43.487 --> 50:46.855
- How do you do? I'm Susan Vance.
- How do you do, Miss Susan?

50:46.890 --> 50:49.858
- Hello, Elizabeth.
- You're much too big to swing on gates.

50:49.893 --> 50:53.361
- I found that out.
- Susan, where are you going?

50:53.396 --> 50:54.462
I'm just going out.

50:54.497 --> 50:57.799
You should be watching George,
not playing with telephones...

50:57.834 --> 50:58.866
Excuse me.

50:58.901 --> 51:00.768
George is fast asleep in my room.

51:00.803 --> 51:04.037
Now come here, young man,
and don't be afraid.

51:04.072 --> 51:07.341
- You look much better in those clothes.
- Thank you.

51:07.376 --> 51:11.334
- I want you to meet Mr. Bone.
- How do you do, Mr. Bone?

51:12.144 --> 51:15.481
No. You're Mr. Bone.
This is Major Applegate.

51:15.516 --> 51:18.351
Yes, I'm Major Applegate.
At least, I'm pretty sure I am.

51:18.386 --> 51:21.087
That is, I was this morning.

51:21.122 --> 51:22.887
There must be some mistake.

51:22.922 --> 51:26.880
No mistake. I've known Major Applegate
for 20 years. Haven't I, Horace?

51:27.492 --> 51:31.429
Twenty-two, to be exact, I think,
Elizabeth. It was long about...

51:31.464 --> 51:35.065
- How do you do, Mr. Applegate?
- How do you do again. Thank you.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.902
- Now, Mr. Bone, we'll go for a walk.
- I'd like to explain...

51:38.937 --> 51:42.506
- You don't need to.
- That's all right. I understand.

51:42.541 --> 51:46.498
Goodbye, Major Applegate... Mr. Bone.

51:47.510 --> 51:50.913
Strange young man, isn't he?
Is he suffering from something?

51:50.948 --> 51:52.515
He's had a nervous breakdown.

51:52.550 --> 51:54.750
- Had or has?
- Had.

51:54.785 --> 51:56.952
It's left him sort of... You know.

51:56.987 --> 51:59.788
My, my, what a pity. And so young, too.

51:59.823 --> 52:02.758
The trouble is, Susan seems
to be showing the same tendencies.

52:02.793 --> 52:04.558
Is that so? You're all right, though?

52:04.593 --> 52:08.162
- I hope so. Have a drink.
- Thank you.

52:08.197 --> 52:11.432
Conversation at dinner
may be a trifle difficult...

52:11.467 --> 52:15.201
on account of this young man,
so I want you to draw him out.

52:15.236 --> 52:17.537
I don't know what you mean.

52:17.572 --> 52:20.940
Talk about something he understands.
Big-game hunting, for instance.

52:20.975 --> 52:24.677
- He's a hunter like yourself.
- You don't say.

52:24.712 --> 52:27.679
Then, Elizabeth,
you've come to the right man.

52:27.714 --> 52:31.650
There. He's fed.
Now I'm sure he's going to be quiet.

52:31.685 --> 52:35.643
Come on, let's go in to dinner.
Why are you just sitting there?

52:36.654 --> 52:40.647
I'm just trying to figure out
how I ever got mixed up in all this.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.760
"Mr. Bone." Isn't that amazing?

52:42.795 --> 52:46.564
You told me not to tell Aunt Elizabeth
what your real name was.

52:46.599 --> 52:50.556
I didn't tell you
to think up a name like Bone.

52:54.905 --> 52:58.897
Stay there, George.
Come on, quickly! Get out of here!

52:58.974 --> 53:01.977
- Shut the door.
- What's the matter?

53:02.012 --> 53:05.581
Did you ever think what would happen
if Baby and George got together?

53:05.616 --> 53:08.149
- They'd probably like each other.
- And if they didn't?

53:08.184 --> 53:11.786
- Baby would eat George.
- That's what I mean.

53:11.821 --> 53:15.779
There it was, straight before me,
crouching as tigers do before the kill.

53:16.591 --> 53:18.193
But I was ready for him.

53:18.227 --> 53:22.185
I drew a bead, leveled away
and caught him right between the eyes.

53:22.596 --> 53:25.599
My, it certainly was
a thrilling experience...

53:25.634 --> 53:28.968
as I'm sure you'll all agree...

53:29.003 --> 53:32.961
or do you, Mr. Bone?

53:35.575 --> 53:39.011
Have you ever been...
Pardon me. So sorry.

53:39.046 --> 53:42.280
Have you ever been in Arabia, Mr. Bone?

53:42.315 --> 53:45.784
I said, "Have you ever been in Arabia?"

53:45.819 --> 53:46.885
No.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.877
I suppose you've spent
most of your time in Africa?

53:50.921 --> 53:53.057
- Tibet, perhaps?
- No.

53:53.092 --> 53:57.050
- Malay Peninsula, perchance?
- Excuse me.

53:59.497 --> 54:01.831
At least that got a rise out of him.

54:01.866 --> 54:04.968
You see, you shouldn't have mentioned
the Malay Peninsula.

54:05.003 --> 54:08.605
He was horribly clawed there by a tiger.
He doesn't like talking about it.

54:08.640 --> 54:11.807
I had a gun bearer once
who was clawed by a tiger.

54:11.842 --> 54:15.800
He... The poor...

54:16.845 --> 54:20.616
I was just telling Major Applegate
that you were clawed by a tiger...

54:20.651 --> 54:22.717
in the Malay Peninsula.

54:22.752 --> 54:25.920
I've never been there.

54:25.955 --> 54:29.913
You've never... Well, no matter.

54:30.224 --> 54:34.094
What type of gun do you use
in hunting tigers, Mr. Bone?

54:34.129 --> 54:38.087
I personally use a bolt-action Mauser
with a very large bore.

54:38.965 --> 54:41.902
Excuse me.

54:41.937 --> 54:45.571
Susan, imagine giving a dinner party
with your husband stalking...

54:45.606 --> 54:49.564
like Hamlet's ghost all through the meal.

54:54.078 --> 54:56.881
Give me patience.

54:56.916 --> 55:00.874
No, this is too much. I can't stand it.

55:01.219 --> 55:05.211
We were talking about the jungle
while you were away, Mr. Bone.

55:05.956 --> 55:09.626
- My soup is gone.
- It was cold.

55:09.661 --> 55:13.619
Digging trenches.
Blaming it on an innocent dog.

55:14.597 --> 55:17.133
Nothing but a heap of nonsense.

55:17.168 --> 55:20.803
Enough to drive a man crazy.

55:20.838 --> 55:23.973
And then they say,
"Keep away from the bottle. Don't drink."

55:24.008 --> 55:27.965
No, not even a wee drop
to steady a man's nerves.

55:28.877 --> 55:31.146
If one more thing happens, I'll quit.

55:31.181 --> 55:35.138
And where Aloysius Gogarty goes,
Mrs. Aloysius Gogarty goes, too.

55:36.317 --> 55:40.310
A doctor chasing after a dog!

55:43.157 --> 55:44.758
Just picture it.

55:44.793 --> 55:47.660
A vast, mysterious silence
vibrant with life...

55:47.695 --> 55:51.297
strange cries in the night.

55:51.332 --> 55:54.934
- Good gracious, what was that?
- That was a loon, Elizabeth.

55:54.969 --> 55:57.035
L-O-O-N, yes.

55:57.070 --> 56:01.028
Once you've got the jungle in your blood,
I wouldn't be able to keep you out of it.

56:03.675 --> 56:06.345
- Susan, did you hear that?
- I didn't hear a thing.

56:06.380 --> 56:09.847
- You didn't?
- Are you quite sure that was a loon?

56:09.882 --> 56:12.116
Yes, indeed. I've heard many a loon.

56:12.151 --> 56:14.919
And if there ever was a loon,
that is a loon.

56:14.954 --> 56:18.911
- Isn't it, Mr. Bone?
- No.

56:19.255 --> 56:21.992
- Well, what do you say it was?
- A leopard.

56:22.027 --> 56:23.326
Don't be ridiculous.

56:23.361 --> 56:26.096
Major Applegate would know a leopard cry
if he heard it.

56:26.131 --> 56:29.264
Thank you, Elizabeth.
I'm an authority on animal cries.

56:29.299 --> 56:31.634
Now, you take the rogue elephant,
for instance.

56:31.669 --> 56:34.737
Excuse me, Major. You're right.
It is a loon.

56:34.772 --> 56:36.305
Thank you.

56:36.340 --> 56:40.241
The leopard's cry is something that,
once heard, you can never forget.

56:40.276 --> 56:43.011
Yes, I know.

56:43.046 --> 56:44.445
You know. Thank you.

56:44.480 --> 56:47.949
Of course, it varies at different seasons.

56:47.984 --> 56:50.751
- Let me see now, what month is this?
- June.

56:50.786 --> 56:54.744
June? It would go something like this.

56:55.288 --> 56:58.058
I'll just prepare for it.

56:58.093 --> 57:00.760
Now, let me see.

57:00.795 --> 57:04.753
There we have it.

57:09.468 --> 57:12.070
- Pardon me.
- It's still a loon.

57:12.105 --> 57:15.206
Of course, I haven't practiced
the leopard cry in a long time.

57:15.241 --> 57:16.675
I'm slightly out of voice.

57:16.710 --> 57:20.667
- Try again.
- Yes, I shall.

57:28.085 --> 57:29.987
Now, I didn't do that.

57:30.022 --> 57:32.488
It was probably an echo.

57:32.523 --> 57:35.158
It was a long time coming back, wasn't it?

57:35.193 --> 57:39.151
- Try again.
- I shall.

57:43.231 --> 57:47.002
There. That's better.

57:47.037 --> 57:48.203
That's peculiar.

57:48.238 --> 57:50.739
There aren't any leopards
in Connecticut, are there?

57:50.774 --> 57:52.006
- Yes.
- No.

57:52.041 --> 57:55.810
- Why do you say yes?
- You see... Pardon me.

57:55.845 --> 57:56.877
Excuse me.

57:56.912 --> 57:59.980
Susan! Finish your dinner
and stop this nonsense.

58:00.015 --> 58:02.849
All right, but you'll be sorry.

58:02.884 --> 58:06.842
I can't stand it.
I've got to get away from it.

58:07.220 --> 58:10.290
Instead of sitting decently at the table
eating their dinners...

58:10.325 --> 58:14.282
they're howling and roaring at one another
like a lot of banshees.

58:14.960 --> 58:18.953
And then they say,
"Gogarty, you mustn't drink.

58:18.997 --> 58:22.990
"Gogarty, you must keep away
from the bottle."

58:23.735 --> 58:24.969
The bottle.

58:25.004 --> 58:27.538
As if a man didn't need something
to listen to them.

58:27.573 --> 58:29.373
I'm within my rights.

58:29.408 --> 58:33.366
I'm perfectly within my...

58:35.746 --> 58:39.739
If one more thing happens to upset me,
I'll be seeing things.

58:47.289 --> 58:51.282
Hannah.

58:55.330 --> 58:59.323
Hannah Gogarty!

58:59.367 --> 59:02.971
Me gun!

59:03.006 --> 59:06.440
- Now what's happened?
- This is no time for personalities.

59:06.475 --> 59:09.409
What would you be wanting of a gun now?

59:09.444 --> 59:11.378
Hand me my gun.

59:11.413 --> 59:13.347
Be quiet, both of you!

59:13.382 --> 59:15.349
Gogarty, what is all this?

59:15.384 --> 59:18.017
- I saw it outside.
- Saw what?

59:18.052 --> 59:21.554
A cat as big as a cow,
with eyes like balls of fire.

59:21.589 --> 59:24.190
Clean up this mess.
And serve the next course.

59:24.225 --> 59:26.958
Do you realize what's happened?
Baby's escaped!

59:26.993 --> 59:28.593
- I don't care.
- We've got to catch him.

59:28.628 --> 59:31.129
- I've got to watch George.
- You're not staying here.

59:31.164 --> 59:34.399
If you stay here, I'll tell Aunty
that your name is Dr. David Huxley.

59:34.434 --> 59:38.391
- Right now.
- Don't! All right, I'll go with you.

59:38.836 --> 59:42.829
Major Applegate, keep an eye on George!
Thank you.

59:44.208 --> 59:46.277
Baby! The door's open.

59:46.312 --> 59:47.545
- Is he there?
- I don't know.

59:47.580 --> 59:51.214
Nope, he's gone. Oh, dear.
Now Aunt Elizabeth...

59:51.249 --> 59:52.582
Don't lose your head.

59:52.617 --> 59:54.217
- My what?
- Your head.

59:54.252 --> 59:58.154
- I've got my head. I've lost my leopard.
- Now, wait a minute.

59:58.189 --> 01:00:01.156
Nothing's gained by uncontrolled hysteria.

01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:03.258
- Compose yourself.
- What should we do?

01:00:03.293 --> 01:00:07.251
I'll call the zoo, say we saw a leopard,
and they'll catch him. Come on.

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:14.035
Susan, I hope this time
you've come to stay.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:16.437
Yes, I've come to stay, Aunty.

01:00:16.472 --> 01:00:19.439
We've just been walking up and down.

01:00:19.474 --> 01:00:21.208
Where's that young man going now?

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.243
He's just going in to take a rest.

01:00:23.278 --> 01:00:26.580
He has to take frequent rests.
The doctor says...

01:00:26.615 --> 01:00:29.216
Have you ever had jungle fever, Major?

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:33.018
You have. Then you realize
how important rest is.

01:00:33.053 --> 01:00:35.521
Poor Mr. Bone.
In his case, it's rather difficult...

01:00:35.556 --> 01:00:38.958
because he has two doctors.
One says rest, one says exercise.

01:00:38.993 --> 01:00:40.092
Which do you prefer?

01:00:40.127 --> 01:00:43.661
- I think that perhaps...
- Why, Susan, listen to this.

01:00:43.696 --> 01:00:46.264
- What?
- This is a cable from Mark.

01:00:46.299 --> 01:00:48.299
- Mark?
- Not a particle of sense in it.

01:00:48.334 --> 01:00:49.601
What does it say?

01:00:49.636 --> 01:00:53.537
"Are you pleased with Baby? Love, Mark."

01:00:53.572 --> 01:00:57.530
- Mark?
- And not a word about my leopard.

01:00:58.475 --> 01:00:59.977
Your leopard?

01:01:00.012 --> 01:01:02.178
- I've always wanted a leopard.
- Excuse me.

01:01:02.213 --> 01:01:05.114
You know, he promised...

01:01:05.149 --> 01:01:06.482
Thank you very much.

01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:08.918
Don't call the zoo.

01:01:08.953 --> 01:01:12.053
- I just called. It's all fixed.
- Call back and unfix it.

01:01:12.088 --> 01:01:15.190
- No questions, call back.
- I told them they could have the leopard.

01:01:15.225 --> 01:01:17.626
You've given away Baby?
You have no right!

01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:21.329
- It's your fault. You've ruined everything!
- I've had enough. I quit.

01:01:21.364 --> 01:01:23.197
You can't quit. Call them back.

01:01:23.232 --> 01:01:25.499
- But you said...
- Everything's changed.

01:01:25.534 --> 01:01:28.903
- That leopard belongs to Aunt Elizabeth.
- Aunt Elizabeth?

01:01:28.938 --> 01:01:31.338
Just call back and say you were mistaken.

01:01:31.373 --> 01:01:34.374
I've just managed to convince them
that I did see a leopard.

01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:38.044
- They'll never believe me.
- I'll fix that. I'll say you're a drug addict.

01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:42.037
- You're always seeing things.
- Never mind. Give me that phone.

01:01:43.149 --> 01:01:44.650
- Hello, operator?
- Not so loud.

01:01:44.685 --> 01:01:46.251
Get me Westlake-284.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:49.121
- I don't know...
- Never mind, David.

01:01:49.156 --> 01:01:53.114
Hello. Is that zoo?
Nobody's talking baby talk.

01:01:53.992 --> 01:01:56.060
I'm the man that called up
about the leopard.

01:01:56.095 --> 01:01:59.563
You don't have to do anything.
It's all been a mistake.

01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:01.699
- Stop them!
- What's the matter?

01:02:01.734 --> 01:02:05.001
- What did he say?
- It's too late. It was the night watchman.

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:07.637
- He said everybody's out leopard hunting.
- Jeepers!

01:02:07.672 --> 01:02:11.630
You've gotten us into a wonderful mess.
Let's think before we act.

01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:15.700
- You think. You think faster than me.
- What do you take to catch a leopard?

01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:19.181
- How big a leopard?
- We've got to catch him before they do.

01:02:19.216 --> 01:02:23.174
- I've got to watch George.
- We'll take George with us.

01:02:23.252 --> 01:02:25.987
Aunty, we're taking George for a walk.

01:02:26.022 --> 01:02:28.189
- Where's the leash?
- My goodness!

01:02:28.224 --> 01:02:29.590
- Where's George?
- Where's George?

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:32.260
- Why this morbid interest?
- I've got to find him.

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:33.328
What for?

01:02:33.363 --> 01:02:35.263
He knows where my intercostal clavicle is.

01:02:35.298 --> 01:02:36.530
Your what?

01:02:36.565 --> 01:02:39.066
Major Appletree,
you promised to watch George.

01:02:39.101 --> 01:02:40.567
- I did.
- But you didn't.

01:02:40.602 --> 01:02:41.635
Where is he?

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.070
- He's gone.
- Gone where?

01:02:43.105 --> 01:02:45.038
- Out that door.
- Why didn't you say so?

01:02:45.073 --> 01:02:47.073
No, not that door. That door.

01:02:47.108 --> 01:02:49.642
- Thank you.
- That's right.

01:02:49.677 --> 01:02:52.645
I can't stand this another moment.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.247
Come along. Let's get some fresh air.

01:02:55.282 --> 01:02:58.249
- Yes. Shall we run?
- Yes.

01:02:58.284 --> 01:03:02.242
I can't understand why a loon
would answer a leopard's cry.

01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:05.256
There's something wrong.

01:03:05.291 --> 01:03:08.993
- They both sound exactly alike to me.
- No, pardon me, Elizabeth.

01:03:09.028 --> 01:03:11.996
Please, the leopard's cry is
entirely different.

01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:15.989
As I explained to you in there,
the leopard's cry goes like this.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:23.706
What a terrible noise.
I don't see how you do it.

01:03:23.741 --> 01:03:26.442
It's done largely with the palate.

01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:30.445
The hands play an important part
in the resonance and carrying power.

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:34.182
- Why do you put your thumbs together?
- You see, the thumbs...

01:03:34.217 --> 01:03:38.175
it's very necessary that the base
of the thumbs are close together like that.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:42.323
That brings out a sort of pear-shaped tone,
you see?

01:03:42.358 --> 01:03:46.316
Having done this, you take a deep breath,
keep the throat well open...

01:03:46.827 --> 01:03:50.819
and out comes...

01:03:56.636 --> 01:03:59.472
My. That's fine, Elizabeth...

01:03:59.507 --> 01:04:01.473
for one who hasn't had any practice.

01:04:01.508 --> 01:04:03.809
Really, it is. You've got something there.

01:04:03.844 --> 01:04:06.512
- Got what?
- The mating cry.

01:04:06.547 --> 01:04:09.648
- Now, don't be rude, Horace.
- I'm not rude.

01:04:09.683 --> 01:04:12.517
I was merely alluding to the scream
you did just now.

01:04:12.552 --> 01:04:14.585
- I didn't scream.
- You didn't scream?

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:16.821
- I certainly did not.
- You didn't scream?

01:04:16.856 --> 01:04:19.057
No. I ought to know if I screamed.

01:04:19.092 --> 01:04:21.392
Then there must be
something wrong here.

01:04:21.427 --> 01:04:24.861
I should say so.
I've never known anything like it.

01:04:24.896 --> 01:04:28.165
Ever since I came into the house
there's been something wrong.

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.566
- Elizabeth...
- It's been bedlam!

01:04:29.601 --> 01:04:33.169
- Don't you think it's time we went inside?
- No. We've only just left it.

01:04:33.204 --> 01:04:35.704
But don't you think
it's a good idea to go back?

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:38.441
No, I think it's a good idea
to continue our walk.

01:04:38.476 --> 01:04:42.434
But don't you find it a bit chilly
without a gun?

01:04:50.218 --> 01:04:52.687
- Why don't you sing, David?
- I can't.

01:04:52.722 --> 01:04:55.889
- You can. You have a fine strong voice.
- But not for singing.

01:04:55.924 --> 01:04:59.093
It's not fair. You're just being stubborn.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:02.863
- That's a dog.
- George.

01:05:02.898 --> 01:05:06.855
- What's the matter?
- Something moved in that bush.

01:05:07.166 --> 01:05:11.159
Let me go first.

01:05:27.418 --> 01:05:30.221
Don't you think it would be better
if I went first?

01:05:30.256 --> 01:05:33.257
No. You might get hurt.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:36.793
Thank you, David.

01:05:36.828 --> 01:05:39.395
- I can't see a thing.
- Neither can I.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:43.388
Are you sure you saw something moving
in here, because I can't...

01:05:43.933 --> 01:05:46.235
Susan, where are you?

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:50.228
- Here I am.
- This is no time to be playing squat tag.

01:05:51.807 --> 01:05:55.144
I'm not playing.

01:05:55.179 --> 01:05:59.136
I'm caught on something.
Help me, will you?

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.383
- Help me, will you?
- No. That's poison ivy.

01:06:02.418 --> 01:06:04.886
I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallow
this way.

01:06:04.921 --> 01:06:07.487
I'll bet she knows poison ivy
when she sees it.

01:06:07.522 --> 01:06:10.657
Yes, I bet poison ivy
runs when it sees her.

01:06:10.692 --> 01:06:14.650
I'm not here to discuss Miss Swallow.
I'm looking for George. I'll find him if...

01:06:19.365 --> 01:06:23.358
David, are you all right?

01:06:24.503 --> 01:06:27.640
- Don't laugh.
- I can't help it.

01:06:27.675 --> 01:06:31.632
You look so silly.

01:06:56.732 --> 01:06:59.534
Did you hear that? That's Baby.

01:06:59.569 --> 01:07:03.527
- It's George, too.
- You don't suppose...

01:07:03.638 --> 01:07:07.631
Shut up.

01:07:08.009 --> 01:07:12.001
Look!

01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:20.321
Look, David, they like each other.

01:07:20.356 --> 01:07:24.313
But goodness knows
how long that's going to last.

01:07:29.996 --> 01:07:33.988
In another minute, my intercostal clavicle
will be gone forever.

01:07:38.503 --> 01:07:40.439
Here, George. Come here.

01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:44.431
No. Susan, be quiet.

01:07:50.815 --> 01:07:52.816
Is there any way to cross this stream?

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:56.809
- Surely it's shallow. We can wade across.
- Good.

01:08:02.392 --> 01:08:06.384
The riverbed's changed.

01:08:08.697 --> 01:08:10.699
Did we get across?

01:08:10.734 --> 01:08:14.691
No, we're right back where we started,
only we're wet.

01:08:16.069 --> 01:08:18.773
Now George and Baby have disappeared.

01:08:18.808 --> 01:08:22.710
While you were at it, you might
as well have gone to the other side.

01:08:22.745 --> 01:08:25.379
While I'm wet I'm gonna go
to the other side!

01:08:25.413 --> 01:08:29.372
Don't leave me!

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.912
If we'd had a bathhouse,
this wouldn't have been so complicated.

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:40.091
Next time I'll try and arrange one.

01:08:40.127 --> 01:08:44.085
Or perhaps there are portable bathhouses
for people like you. There must be.

01:08:45.462 --> 01:08:47.599
Don't be so grouchy.

01:08:47.634 --> 01:08:51.303
We could have such fun. There's moonlight
and everything is so lovely.

01:08:51.337 --> 01:08:53.772
- And I do so like being with you.
- You do?

01:08:53.807 --> 01:08:55.439
Well, I like peace and quiet.

01:08:55.474 --> 01:08:58.908
But it's peaceful and quiet here.

01:08:58.944 --> 01:09:02.578
Let's just stay here and let George
and Baby look for us.

01:09:02.613 --> 01:09:05.049
Your sock's on fire.

01:09:05.084 --> 01:09:09.041
That's all right. I don't care anymore.

01:09:09.952 --> 01:09:13.944
- That's fine. Throw the other one in.
- That's true. You could have...

01:09:14.057 --> 01:09:15.792
Don't be upset, David.

01:09:15.827 --> 01:09:17.459
Well, who wouldn't be?

01:09:17.493 --> 01:09:19.895
Here I am, trying to help you
find a leopard...

01:09:19.930 --> 01:09:22.798
so that your Aunt Elizabeth
won't be angry at you.

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:26.791
And then she'll probably give you
the $1 million I need for my museum.

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:32.062
If you'd planned it, you couldn't have
ruined my chances more completely.

01:09:32.907 --> 01:09:36.010
You told your aunt I was crazy, didn't you?

01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:39.712
You told her my name was Bone
and you didn't tell me.

01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:42.415
You told her I was a big-game hunter
and didn't tell me.

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:44.884
You tell anybody anything
that comes into your head...

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:47.520
and you don't tell me.

01:09:47.555 --> 01:09:50.856
- Here's something else I didn't tell you.
- What now?

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:54.626
Mr. Peabody's coming
to see Aunt Elizabeth tonight.

01:09:54.661 --> 01:09:58.618
Oh, dear. That's the end, that's all.

01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:01.999
Peabody's sure to tell your aunt who I am.

01:10:02.034 --> 01:10:04.602
He'll never remember
those four years' hard work...

01:10:04.637 --> 01:10:07.372
I put in on that brontosaurus. No.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:11.364
All he'll remember is that I conked him
on the head with a rock last night.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.979
Where's that music coming from, David?

01:10:16.014 --> 01:10:19.749
Westlake. There's a circus there. A...

01:10:19.784 --> 01:10:21.984
<i>Come and see the Harem Nights, boys.</i>

01:10:22.019 --> 01:10:25.454
<i>Sheena and Neema. They've just escaped
from the palace of a sheik.</i>

01:10:25.489 --> 01:10:26.956
The owner's got a job for you.

01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:29.058
He wants you to take his leopard
to Bridgeport.

01:10:29.093 --> 01:10:31.993
- What happened?
- Just gave his new trainer a going-over.

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.094
Hurt him bad?

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:36.197
Bad? You think three minutes alone
with that cat did him any good?

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:39.067
Should've shot him last summer,
when he ripped up Calhouney.

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:40.402
What do we do with him?

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:43.137
Deliver him to this address.
They've got a gas chamber.

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:46.173
- I've phoned over. You go along, too, Mac.
- Who, me?

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:48.642
- You heard what I said.
- Where is Bridgeport?

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.844
How should I know?
Somewhere on the state highway.

01:10:50.879 --> 01:10:53.813
Ask somebody, and get going.

01:10:53.848 --> 01:10:56.816
- Well, that's that. Let's get going.
- All right.

01:10:56.851 --> 01:10:58.151
Sure you don't want my coat?

01:10:58.186 --> 01:11:02.143
- No, I'm completely dry.
- Let's go, then.

01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:06.881
I wonder what that is?

01:11:08.693 --> 01:11:11.730
Hey, Mac, see what that sign says.

01:11:11.765 --> 01:11:14.031
- David, it's the zoo truck.
- Is it?

01:11:14.066 --> 01:11:16.434
They've got Baby.

01:11:16.469 --> 01:11:17.902
Is George with him?

01:11:17.937 --> 01:11:20.871
I can't see George, but we've got
to get Baby away from them.

01:11:20.906 --> 01:11:23.506
No. All I promised to do
was help you find Baby.

01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:24.541
You found him.

01:11:24.576 --> 01:11:27.644
All you have to do is go
and talk to those men in the front...

01:11:27.679 --> 01:11:29.746
while I let Baby out the back.
Give me the rope.

01:11:29.781 --> 01:11:31.080
But what'll I say to them?

01:11:31.115 --> 01:11:33.615
They're from the zoo.
Tell them you're a zoologist.

01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:37.608
Talk about zoos. Go ahead, go on.

01:11:37.786 --> 01:11:39.521
I can't find Bridgeport.

01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.957
You've got the map upside down.

01:11:41.992 --> 01:11:45.092
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Hello.

01:11:45.127 --> 01:11:46.561
May I help you?

01:11:46.596 --> 01:11:50.031
Yeah. Do you know the way to Bridgeport?

01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:51.699
I'm not going to Bridgeport.

01:11:51.734 --> 01:11:54.734
Not you. We're going to Bridgeport.
Do you know which way it is?

01:11:54.769 --> 01:11:56.837
- Yes.
- It's that way, ain't it?

01:11:56.872 --> 01:12:00.830
- Yes.
- But I thought it was that way.

01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:02.976
- Yes, it is.
- There, I told you.

01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:06.078
Don't you worry. I'll soon get you out.

01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.047
Come on.

01:12:08.082 --> 01:12:10.216
Get this around your neck,
that's a good boy.

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:12.885
Put your head through. Come on.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.753
Hey, what's the big idea? Come on.

01:12:15.788 --> 01:12:18.289
Put your head through here,
and I'll take you back home.

01:12:18.324 --> 01:12:20.492
Come on, sweetie.

01:12:20.527 --> 01:12:23.728
...and New York is straight ahead.

01:12:23.763 --> 01:12:25.697
This guy ain't got all his buttons.

01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:28.599
Well, I... You see...

01:12:28.634 --> 01:12:31.268
- We have a...
- David, he's escaped!

01:12:31.303 --> 01:12:34.204
- I was just explaining to these gentlemen...
- He's escaped!

01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:37.240
Oh, he's escaped.
Shall we help you tie him up, lady?

01:12:37.275 --> 01:12:39.775
No, not me. You're mistaken.

01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:43.768
Goodnight, gentlemen.

01:12:50.218 --> 01:12:53.655
Over there.
We're on the right track now, I'm sure.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:54.723
Do you see him?

01:12:54.758 --> 01:12:57.192
- I think he's further down this way.
- I'll try here.

01:12:57.227 --> 01:13:01.184
I'm absolutely certain the sound's coming
from this way.

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:04.098
- What's that?
- Somebody's shooting at him.

01:13:04.133 --> 01:13:07.134
- You missed it again.
- Quiet!

01:13:07.169 --> 01:13:09.736
Major Applegate, don't shoot.

01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:12.305
Stand back, please. I won't miss this time.

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.807
You don't understand.
We're trying to catch it.

01:13:14.842 --> 01:13:17.076
- You are? Well, so am I.
- It's a tame leopard.

01:13:17.111 --> 01:13:20.946
I don't like to say so at this moment,
but everybody knows you're crazy.

01:13:20.981 --> 01:13:23.181
- Please don't do that.
- Miss Susan, please!

01:13:23.216 --> 01:13:26.585
Why don't you explain to him?
Perhaps he'll catch your leopard.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:30.121
You know that Aunt Elizabeth was
expecting a leopard from Brazil, don't you?

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:33.291
- I had heard that.
- Well, that's her leopard, and it's tame.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:37.284
Impossible. There can be no such thing
as a tame...

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:39.330
A tame leopard?

01:13:39.365 --> 01:13:41.131
We had it locked up and it escaped.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.233
- Are you sure it's quite harmless?
- Absolutely.

01:13:43.268 --> 01:13:46.236
My goodness,
why didn't you say so in the first place?

01:13:46.271 --> 01:13:50.073
I apologize to you, Mr. Boney, I really do.

01:13:50.107 --> 01:13:53.075
Even though it is tame,
I think we should try to catch it.

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.344
Which way did it go?

01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:56.679
That way.

01:13:56.714 --> 01:14:00.049
We'll go that way, you go that way.
Come on, David. Don't shoot.

01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:04.041
No, of course not.

01:14:05.987 --> 01:14:07.689
I knew all the time he was tame.

01:14:07.724 --> 01:14:10.725
- Is that so?
- Yes, I patted him on the back.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:13.594
Stretched me hand right out,
patted him on the back.

01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:16.263
- He's as gentle as a kitty.
- Gentle as a kitty?

01:14:16.298 --> 01:14:18.999
I don't know
why you didn't mention all this...

01:14:19.034 --> 01:14:20.667
There he is.

01:14:20.702 --> 01:14:24.659
This will all be quite simple.
Let me have that rope, will you?

01:14:24.837 --> 01:14:28.207
Now, you hold the gun.
We shan't need that any further.

01:14:28.242 --> 01:14:31.978
Gogarty, you stand perfectly still
and leave everything to me.

01:14:32.013 --> 01:14:35.714
I've had vast experience in these matters.

01:14:35.749 --> 01:14:38.183
Here, kitty.

01:14:38.218 --> 01:14:42.176
Come, kitty.

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:45.689
Don't you fool me.

01:14:45.724 --> 01:14:49.682
You're not afraid of me, now, are you?
Come, puss.

01:14:50.227 --> 01:14:52.196
You say you patted this beast?

01:14:52.231 --> 01:14:56.188
In a manner of speaking, I did.

01:14:57.634 --> 01:15:01.627
Personally, Gogarty, I think you're a liar.

01:15:04.439 --> 01:15:06.875
Get out of me way!

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:10.868
Use the gun!

01:15:13.048 --> 01:15:15.149
- You see him, David?
- No.

01:15:15.184 --> 01:15:18.853
I seem to have lost my sense of direction.
I wonder where we are.

01:15:18.888 --> 01:15:22.846
My guess is, somewhere
near the Canadian border by now.

01:15:25.191 --> 01:15:27.994
My glasses! Don't move, Susan.

01:15:28.029 --> 01:15:30.196
Here they are.

01:15:30.231 --> 01:15:33.767
They're broken. I'm so sorry.

01:15:33.802 --> 01:15:35.868
It doesn't make any difference.

01:15:35.903 --> 01:15:39.861
The things I've been doing today,
I can do just as well with my eyes shut.

01:15:41.974 --> 01:15:44.476
Anyway, David, you look much handsomer
without them.

01:15:44.511 --> 01:15:45.711
Stop it.

01:15:45.746 --> 01:15:49.703
Look, David, I've lost my heel!
Look at me walk.

01:15:53.818 --> 01:15:55.353
- Born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.

01:15:55.388 --> 01:15:59.189
- I was born on the side of a hill.
- Stop.

01:15:59.224 --> 01:16:02.125
Look, Susan,
we're not getting anywhere like this.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:05.162
You must be very tired,
and I suggest you go home.

01:16:05.197 --> 01:16:07.463
But, David, we can't quit now.

01:16:07.498 --> 01:16:10.433
We've let a wild animal loose
on an innocent countryside.

01:16:10.468 --> 01:16:13.235
We can't just go home and sleep.
It wouldn't be right.

01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:17.228
You misunderstand me.
I want you to go home.

01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:22.733
- You mean you want me to go home?
- Yes.

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:26.414
You mean you don't want me
to help you anymore?

01:16:26.449 --> 01:16:29.083
- No.
- After all the fun we've had?

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:32.119
- Yes.
- And after all the things I've done for you?

01:16:32.154 --> 01:16:33.220
That's what I mean.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:36.323
All right, I know enough
to go when I'm not wanted.

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:40.315
And don't you worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:43.830
Oh, my goodness.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.998
Are you all right? Did you hurt yourself?

01:16:46.033 --> 01:16:49.935
No, I didn't hurt myself. It's not that.

01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:53.905
It's just that I'm miserable
because you don't like me anymore.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.006
Yes, I do.

01:16:55.041 --> 01:16:57.876
You tried to get rid of me
and you don't think of me.

01:16:57.911 --> 01:16:59.910
You don't like me anymore.

01:16:59.945 --> 01:17:03.881
Your face is dirty.

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:06.016
Now you're being nice to me...

01:17:06.051 --> 01:17:10.009
after all the horrible things
I've done to you.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.455
Stop crying, Susan, please.

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:15.925
It's just that everything I do
with the best intentions...

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.861
seems to turn out badly.

01:17:17.896 --> 01:17:20.230
Yes, it does, doesn't it?

01:17:20.265 --> 01:17:24.222
Please let me come with you.

01:17:28.203 --> 01:17:31.006
All right, Susan. You can come with me.

01:17:31.041 --> 01:17:34.108
- Are you sure you want me?
- Yes.

01:17:34.143 --> 01:17:37.512
- Positive?
- Yes, you can come. Come on.

01:17:37.547 --> 01:17:39.847
Well, don't you worry, David.

01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:42.449
Because if there's anything
that I can do to help you...

01:17:42.484 --> 01:17:46.286
just let me know, and I'll do it.

01:17:46.321 --> 01:17:50.279
Don't do it until I let you know.

01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:01.823
Come on, George.

01:18:02.468 --> 01:18:06.460
Look, David. Baby's on the roof.

01:18:08.206 --> 01:18:10.842
Come on, Baby. Come on down.

01:18:10.877 --> 01:18:12.911
Make him get down.

01:18:12.946 --> 01:18:16.903
I suppose you'd like me
to climb up and push him down.

01:18:17.047 --> 01:18:21.040
Maybe we'd better sing.

01:18:21.084 --> 01:18:25.076
Sing, David.

01:19:02.956 --> 01:19:06.948
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back!

01:19:09.528 --> 01:19:11.663
Not you, it.

01:19:11.698 --> 01:19:15.567
- What are you doing, may I ask?
- Singing.

01:19:15.602 --> 01:19:18.903
If you're paying a bet,
there must be somewhere else to pay it.

01:19:18.938 --> 01:19:21.973
I'm not paying a bet,
there's a leopard on your roof.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:25.966
I'm not going to bandy words
with you at this time of night.

01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:28.478
There is a leopard on your roof,
and it's mine.

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:30.981
I have to get it,
and to get it, I have to sing.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:32.249
There's nothing on my roof.

01:19:32.284 --> 01:19:34.651
Come on, you fool.
There's nothing on your roof?

01:19:34.686 --> 01:19:38.643
- No!
- All right. There's nothing on your roof.

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:45.583
Poor girl. You'd better go down, Fritz.

01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:50.153
- Sing if you like, dear.
- Thank you.

01:19:50.198 --> 01:19:54.191
You can sing, too.

01:19:56.004 --> 01:19:59.573
Baby, don't! Why did you have to do that?
You frightened him away.

01:19:59.608 --> 01:20:01.608
- Quiet, it's all right.
- It's not all right.

01:20:01.643 --> 01:20:04.211
- Don't worry.
- I have to worry. I've lost my leopard.

01:20:04.246 --> 01:20:06.513
- Please help me find him.
- I will. Come with me.

01:20:06.548 --> 01:20:08.715
- But he went that way.
- No, he didn't.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.517
- Yes, he did. I saw him.
- You're wrong. He's up there.

01:20:11.552 --> 01:20:15.510
- Where?
- Peeking around the corner. See it?

01:20:18.090 --> 01:20:20.025
There's nothing there!

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.360
Yes, there is.
You just come along into the house.

01:20:22.395 --> 01:20:24.195
Let me go! I don't want to go with you.

01:20:24.230 --> 01:20:27.165
You don't seem to understand
that there's $1 million at stake.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.200
$1 million? Well, you will get it.

01:20:30.235 --> 01:20:33.370
We have it right in there, all in $1 bills.

01:20:33.405 --> 01:20:34.538
Now you come along.

01:20:34.573 --> 01:20:38.531
No! Don't do this to me! This is awful!

01:20:49.218 --> 01:20:52.521
Elmer, look.

01:20:52.556 --> 01:20:56.514
- You know him?
- No. Looks like a peeping Tom.

01:20:57.659 --> 01:21:01.652
Get your gun out. We'll nab him.

01:21:06.133 --> 01:21:08.035
Stick them up.

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:11.706
Grab him, Elmer.

01:21:11.741 --> 01:21:14.407
I have to get my dog.
Don't go away, George!

01:21:14.442 --> 01:21:18.400
Don't argue. Inside.

01:21:21.748 --> 01:21:25.617
- What are you doing?
- I have a hairpin.

01:21:25.652 --> 01:21:27.286
I did it once with a trunk.

01:21:27.321 --> 01:21:30.122
Anyway, when they find out who we are,
they'll let us out.

01:21:30.157 --> 01:21:34.114
When they find out who you are,
they'll pad the cell.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:39.097
We've picked up a girl
who says she's your niece.

01:21:39.132 --> 01:21:42.400
Now, the question is,
have you or have you not got a niece?

01:21:42.435 --> 01:21:46.236
Of course I have a niece, but she's not
singing around under windows.

01:21:46.271 --> 01:21:47.704
She's decently in bed.

01:21:47.739 --> 01:21:50.273
I wouldn't be too sure, Elizabeth.

01:21:50.308 --> 01:21:53.076
Horace, do be quiet.
I'll talk to you presently.

01:21:53.111 --> 01:21:56.278
Now, lady, do you definitely refuse
to come and identify this girl?

01:21:56.313 --> 01:21:59.115
If you continue to annoy me
about this girl...

01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:03.085
who is no responsibility of mine,
I'll have you arrested.

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.454
- The idea.
- Hello.

01:22:06.489 --> 01:22:08.156
She says her niece is in bed.

01:22:08.191 --> 01:22:10.392
Just what I expected. That girl is lying.

01:22:10.427 --> 01:22:14.262
- I think they're both lying.
- What are you going to do about it?

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:16.096
- What would you do?
- Find out the truth.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.499
You're right.
I'll have a little talk with them.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:22.492
Come on, Elmer. Open her up.

01:22:22.803 --> 01:22:26.039
You two, get your ears up
'cause I've got something to tell you.

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:28.408
- If you wanna get out, better listen.
- I'm listening.

01:22:28.443 --> 01:22:30.076
Quiet. I'll get to you later.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.178
I want you to tell me the whole truth.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.447
- What did my aunt say?
- Be quiet, please.

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.182
What did my aunt say?

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:39.151
Your aunt said...
Young lady, you haven't got an aunt.

01:22:39.186 --> 01:22:41.720
- I certainly have got an aunt.
- Quiet, please.

01:22:41.755 --> 01:22:44.289
Look here, young fellow,
I want you to tell me...

01:22:44.324 --> 01:22:46.425
just exactly what were you doing tonight?

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:49.693
- We were hunting for a leopard.
- You were hunting for a leopard?

01:22:49.728 --> 01:22:52.096
Now look here, young lady,
you know that's silly.

01:22:52.131 --> 01:22:55.366
- There never was a leopard in Connecticut.
- There is now.

01:22:55.401 --> 01:22:56.434
Now, listen here.

01:22:56.469 --> 01:23:00.426
I'm going to stay here if it takes all year.
I am waiting for you to tell the truth.

01:23:00.537 --> 01:23:04.207
If you wait for her to tell the truth,
you'll have a long gray beard.

01:23:04.242 --> 01:23:06.576
You know, my grandfather had... Quiet!

01:23:06.611 --> 01:23:09.344
Young man, I don't want
any more slick remarks out of you.

01:23:09.379 --> 01:23:11.580
This is a jail.
Have a little respect for the law.

01:23:11.615 --> 01:23:13.082
I'm just trying to explain.

01:23:13.117 --> 01:23:16.485
It all started over at my aunt...
Her aunt's house.

01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:17.886
Her aunt's house?

01:23:17.921 --> 01:23:21.878
- Her aunt promised to give me a lot of...
- Hold on there, bub. Just a minute.

01:23:22.190 --> 01:23:23.257
She hasn't got an aunt.

01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:25.193
I do. She's my father's sister.

01:23:25.228 --> 01:23:27.895
Look here, Constable,
stop wasting your time. Now, quiet.

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:30.564
You want us to get out of here, don't you?

01:23:30.599 --> 01:23:32.699
Lady, yes, I certainly do.

01:23:32.734 --> 01:23:35.602
I gave you my aunt's telephone number,
didn't I?

01:23:35.637 --> 01:23:39.573
And you called her up, didn't you?
What did she say?

01:23:39.608 --> 01:23:42.675
- She said that you were home in bed.
- Then what am I doing here?

01:23:42.710 --> 01:23:45.744
You're here because your aunt...

01:23:45.779 --> 01:23:48.581
Confound it, lady,
you know that you haven't got an aunt.

01:23:48.616 --> 01:23:50.748
- If I did have an aunt...
- She'd muzzle you.

01:23:50.783 --> 01:23:52.750
You can't talk to me that way.

01:23:52.785 --> 01:23:56.421
I don't like to see young people in jail.
I have children of my own.

01:23:56.456 --> 01:23:59.891
I don't care about your family.
All I want to do is get out of here.

01:23:59.926 --> 01:24:03.861
I don't have time to waste
sitting around in jail.

01:24:03.896 --> 01:24:06.196
- Go away, please.
- Shut up, David.

01:24:06.231 --> 01:24:10.189
- David, please be quiet.
- Let me tell you what happened.

01:24:13.202 --> 01:24:15.938
You're not going to get anywhere
with her. Just come with me.

01:24:15.973 --> 01:24:19.342
If one of us talks at a time,
now we're really getting somewhere.

01:24:19.377 --> 01:24:21.677
Now then, speak up, speak fast.

01:24:21.712 --> 01:24:24.346
- I'll explain the whole thing...
- Elmer!

01:24:24.381 --> 01:24:28.339
Get the key here, quick. Lock him up.

01:24:28.717 --> 01:24:30.285
A fine officer you are.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:32.753
Locking up a dangerous criminal
without locking him up.

01:24:32.788 --> 01:24:35.723
- Look, it's not locked.
- Thank you.

01:24:35.758 --> 01:24:39.293
I've seen it!
I've seen a cheetah in the park.

01:24:39.328 --> 01:24:41.228
You have no right to do that!

01:24:41.263 --> 01:24:44.831
What's going on here?

01:24:44.866 --> 01:24:47.567
- Here's something for you, Constable.
- What's the charge?

01:24:47.602 --> 01:24:51.560
We caught him in front of the meat market
in Dr. Lehman's stolen car.

01:24:51.671 --> 01:24:54.273
So you're a car thief?

01:24:54.308 --> 01:24:56.775
No man is going
to call Aloysius Gogarty a car thief.

01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:58.844
Come on!

01:24:58.879 --> 01:24:59.978
Lock him up.

01:25:00.013 --> 01:25:02.281
Hey, let go!

01:25:02.316 --> 01:25:05.883
Here you are, fellow.
This should hold you for a while.

01:25:05.918 --> 01:25:07.318
Hello, Gogarty.

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:10.354
Hello, Miss Susan. How did you get here?

01:25:10.389 --> 01:25:11.789
Influence.

01:25:11.824 --> 01:25:13.658
Don't worry, Gogarty. I'll get you out.

01:25:13.693 --> 01:25:15.926
Sure. Look, she got me out.

01:25:15.961 --> 01:25:17.827
Hold on here.
Do you know this young lady?

01:25:17.862 --> 01:25:19.996
Of course. Don't I work for her aunt?

01:25:20.031 --> 01:25:23.500
- You what?
- Don't I work for her aunt?

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:26.368
If one more person mentions
that she's got an aunt...

01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:29.872
I'll put you all
on bread and water for 30 days.

01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:32.641
Well, where is everyone?

01:25:32.676 --> 01:25:33.809
Who's in charge here?

01:25:33.844 --> 01:25:35.677
Right in there. Hey, Constable!

01:25:35.712 --> 01:25:37.512
What do you mean
by locking up my niece?

01:25:37.547 --> 01:25:39.347
I won't stand for it! Give me the keys.

01:25:39.382 --> 01:25:40.815
Madam, you're hysterical.

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:42.951
- What is it you want?
- She wants her niece.

01:25:42.986 --> 01:25:45.286
I certainly do. I want my niece right here.

01:25:45.321 --> 01:25:47.688
- Who is your niece?
- Give us a description of her.

01:25:47.723 --> 01:25:50.424
- She's about so tall...
- Aunt Elizabeth, is that you?

01:25:50.459 --> 01:25:51.825
There she is now.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.761
Hold on just a minute.
Lady, tell me, who are you?

01:25:54.796 --> 01:25:57.263
I am Mrs. Carleton Random,
and I want my niece.

01:25:57.298 --> 01:25:59.432
- You're Mrs. Carleton Random?
- I certainly am.

01:25:59.467 --> 01:26:02.335
- And you say your niece is here?
- She certainly is.

01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:05.238
That's where I got you.
The young lady here ain't got no aunt.

01:26:05.273 --> 01:26:08.373
And you're not Mrs. Carleton Random,
because I talked to her...

01:26:08.408 --> 01:26:09.975
on the phone not 10 minutes ago.

01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:12.043
I ought to know who I am!

01:26:12.078 --> 01:26:15.280
Yes, you should, I think.
You did talk to her 10 minutes ago...

01:26:15.315 --> 01:26:16.348
on the phone.

01:26:16.383 --> 01:26:17.948
- How do you know?
- I was there.

01:26:17.983 --> 01:26:21.385
- Who are you?
- I'm the niece... I'm the aunt...

01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:23.954
I'm Major Horace Applegate
of the Explorer's Club.

01:26:23.989 --> 01:26:25.723
What are you doing with that gun?

01:26:25.758 --> 01:26:29.259
I have been hunting a leopard.

01:26:29.294 --> 01:26:32.295
- You've been hunting leopards?
- I said so, yes.

01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:34.731
- Any luck?
- Not what I'm accustomed to, no.

01:26:34.766 --> 01:26:37.700
I have been a bit confused
regarding the leopards here.

01:26:37.735 --> 01:26:41.692
- Boys.
- You have something on your mind.

01:26:45.974 --> 01:26:49.044
Not so fast, lady. We
just want to find out.

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.046
This old battle-ax keeps
yelling that she's Mrs. Random.

01:26:52.081 --> 01:26:54.315
Why, that's ridiculous.

01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:56.651
Mrs. Random is in bed.

01:26:56.686 --> 01:27:00.643
And don't you be calling up here again.
Good night.

01:27:01.588 --> 01:27:05.592
Good night. Well, just as you said, doc,
they're all lying.

01:27:05.627 --> 01:27:09.529
Obviously. I have no doubt you'll find
you made a very important haul.

01:27:09.564 --> 01:27:10.929
Yeah, thanks to you, doc.

01:27:10.964 --> 01:27:14.922
If you get their confessions, there'll
be a lot of things you will turn up.

01:27:14.967 --> 01:27:18.960
Yeah? Well, I'll try
it again. Come on, boys.

01:27:25.777 --> 01:27:28.479
Quiet!

01:27:28.514 --> 01:27:30.982
I'm warning you.
The first one who lets a squeak out...

01:27:31.017 --> 01:27:32.783
I'll put in solitary confinement.

01:27:32.818 --> 01:27:35.786
I'm gonna ask this man some questions.
I want absolute quiet.

01:27:35.821 --> 01:27:37.721
You said your name's Bone.
You stick to it?

01:27:37.756 --> 01:27:41.391
Won't do any good, we don't believe you.
We know that's an alias.

01:27:41.426 --> 01:27:44.627
- They're all impersonators.
- Why'd you try to break into his house?

01:27:44.662 --> 01:27:46.028
I was after a leopard.

01:27:46.063 --> 01:27:48.130
Leopard. Doc, they still stick to it.

01:27:48.165 --> 01:27:50.533
All agreed on one story.

01:27:50.568 --> 01:27:52.500
How about that bank robbery in Oldtown?

01:27:52.535 --> 01:27:54.469
What about it? How much did they get?

01:27:54.504 --> 01:27:56.838
They got a pretty penny.
Must've got $5,600...

01:27:56.873 --> 01:27:58.807
Say, who's asking the questions,
you or me?

01:27:58.842 --> 01:28:01.676
Who was with you last month
in that mail-truck job?

01:28:01.711 --> 01:28:04.878
Mickey the Mouse and Donald the Duck.

01:28:04.913 --> 01:28:06.914
Doc, make a note of their names.

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:09.717
Now we're getting someplace.
You've gotta speak up.

01:28:09.752 --> 01:28:11.719
Quiet, lady. I'm waiting for you.

01:28:11.754 --> 01:28:13.486
Quiet, lady. Speak up now.

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.356
Hey, flatfoot!

01:28:16.391 --> 01:28:19.359
You ain't getting no place. Come here.

01:28:19.394 --> 01:28:23.352
- Me?
- Yes, you. Come on, haul it over.

01:28:23.429 --> 01:28:25.497
You want someone to talk, don't you?

01:28:25.532 --> 01:28:27.699
It's about time. I certainly do.

01:28:27.734 --> 01:28:31.169
Get me out and I'll unbutton
my puss and shoot the works.

01:28:31.204 --> 01:28:33.905
Say, hold on, lady.
I thought that you were...

01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:37.007
- You ain't no lady!
- I kind of had you fooled, didn't I?

01:28:37.042 --> 01:28:39.677
Always wanted to make a sucker
out of a copper.

01:28:39.712 --> 01:28:41.512
What did I tell you my name was?

01:28:41.547 --> 01:28:45.504
- Your name is... Doc, what's her name?
- Susan Vance.

01:28:46.082 --> 01:28:48.985
Vaunce, kiddie. That's my society moniker.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:52.789
But the mob all calls me
"Swinging Door" Susie.

01:28:52.824 --> 01:28:55.657
Now you peg me?
Come on, toots, open up.

01:28:55.692 --> 01:28:58.127
- Open up, I'll make you feel hot.
- Stop that.

01:28:58.162 --> 01:29:01.096
I'm not opening any doors here
until you promise to talk.

01:29:01.131 --> 01:29:03.665
I talk, I'll talk so much,
it'll make your hair curl.

01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:05.534
Hear that, doc? She's promised to talk.

01:29:05.569 --> 01:29:06.734
All right, open it up.

01:29:06.769 --> 01:29:10.538
Susan, whatever it is, it won't work.

01:29:10.573 --> 01:29:14.531
"Swinging Door" Susie hasn't flopped yet.
I'm out this far, ain't I?

01:29:14.642 --> 01:29:16.643
Well, so long, gang.

01:29:16.678 --> 01:29:20.636
I'm not taking the rap for this job.
It's every man for himself.

01:29:21.581 --> 01:29:25.574
Quiet! I meant what I told you. You, too.

01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:29.811
Quit beefing. Get wise to your pal.
The heat's on, Jerry.

01:29:30.823 --> 01:29:33.559
Ain't his name Bone?

01:29:33.594 --> 01:29:36.829
You mean to say
you don't remember Jerry the Nipper?

01:29:36.864 --> 01:29:37.929
Make a note of that, doc.

01:29:37.964 --> 01:29:40.498
She's making all this up
out of motion pictures.

01:29:40.533 --> 01:29:43.701
I thought I saw you with
that red-headed skirt in a motion picture.

01:29:43.736 --> 01:29:45.036
There, doc, another woman.

01:29:45.071 --> 01:29:49.028
Sure. I wouldn't be squealing
if he hadn't been with another twist.

01:29:49.873 --> 01:29:51.108
So he's a lady-killer?

01:29:51.143 --> 01:29:54.745
A lady-killer?
Why, he's a regular Don Swan.

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:56.246
Loves the ladies, don't you, honey?

01:29:56.281 --> 01:30:00.216
He bops them over. 1, 2, 3, boom!
Just like that.

01:30:00.251 --> 01:30:04.209
- He's a wolf.
- Now I'm a wolf!

01:30:04.554 --> 01:30:06.456
I'll send you a box of birdseed.

01:30:06.491 --> 01:30:09.658
Susie, I want you to tell the truth.
You'll never get into trouble.

01:30:09.693 --> 01:30:12.494
You're limping.
I suppose you got shot in a stickup?

01:30:12.529 --> 01:30:14.996
- No, I lost my heel.
- Don't bother about him.

01:30:15.031 --> 01:30:17.165
Sit down there. Doc, grab this chair.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.134
Elmer, grab a hold of that typewriter.

01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:21.802
I wanna get this whole thing down
in affidavit form.

01:30:21.837 --> 01:30:24.872
- Young lady, I want you to talk...
- Cigarette me, then I'll talk.

01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:27.208
- I don't smoke cigarettes.
- This will have to do.

01:30:27.243 --> 01:30:28.976
- That?
- It's a twofer.

01:30:29.011 --> 01:30:32.679
- What's that?
- Two for a nickel. Give me a match.

01:30:32.714 --> 01:30:34.814
I'm not going to stand
for that in this jail.

01:30:34.849 --> 01:30:37.217
No smoking, no talking.
Put me back in the cell.

01:30:37.252 --> 01:30:39.219
Ain't gonna talk unless I have a cigarette.

01:30:39.254 --> 01:30:43.211
Hold it. Sit down.
Doc, give her one of them cigarettes.

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:48.627
If you'll just tell the truth,
we'll make it as easy as we can...

01:30:48.662 --> 01:30:51.163
My case, if you please.

01:30:51.198 --> 01:30:55.155
There I go again. Sorry. Force of habit.
Forgot where I was for a minute.

01:30:58.169 --> 01:31:01.038
How about a little fresh air?
It's kind of hot in here.

01:31:01.073 --> 01:31:02.639
It is a little bit muggy.

01:31:02.674 --> 01:31:05.976
It's always that way around here,
this time of year.

01:31:06.011 --> 01:31:08.245
It's the humidity.

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:10.113
What about the Cleghorn jewels?

01:31:10.148 --> 01:31:12.615
That's hot ice.
We're waiting for it to cool off.

01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:14.683
We're waiting... What do you mean, "we"?

01:31:14.718 --> 01:31:16.118
The gang. All of us.

01:31:16.153 --> 01:31:18.053
You all belong to the same gang?

01:31:18.088 --> 01:31:20.222
Sure. The Leopard Gang.

01:31:20.257 --> 01:31:24.214
That's what I'm after. We'll round them
all up with one fell swoop.

01:31:24.292 --> 01:31:26.895
Got that, doc? Fine.
How about you, Elmer?

01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:28.763
Not so fast. This is new to me.

01:31:28.798 --> 01:31:31.199
Hold on.
You can't spell "leopard" with a "U."

01:31:31.234 --> 01:31:33.201
- How do you spell it?
- Double "U."

01:31:33.236 --> 01:31:36.603
- What about that bank robbery?
- Boy, wasn't that a honey?

01:31:36.638 --> 01:31:39.840
A neater job has never been pulled
in this neck of the woods.

01:31:39.875 --> 01:31:41.775
Jerry was the inside man on that job.

01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:43.877
He was, was he? Were you there, too?

01:31:43.912 --> 01:31:46.245
Sure, what do you think?
I'm a one-man woman.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.147
Where my man goes, I go.

01:31:48.182 --> 01:31:50.149
"Babyface" Horace, he's the pick-up man...

01:31:50.184 --> 01:31:52.218
Wait! You're talking too fast!

01:31:52.253 --> 01:31:53.920
What's that?

01:31:53.955 --> 01:31:57.122
Confound it, doc! You only got as far
as the Cleghorn jewels.

01:31:57.157 --> 01:32:01.115
We gotta start all over again.
Now, young lady...

01:32:01.326 --> 01:32:03.295
- There she goes.
- She's got my car again!

01:32:03.330 --> 01:32:06.163
Go on, boys, after her.
Hurry up and get her.

01:32:06.198 --> 01:32:07.231
There she goes.

01:32:07.266 --> 01:32:11.224
Go get her, boys! If you don't,
there'll be a shakeup in this department.

01:32:15.172 --> 01:32:17.040
- Are you the constable?
- Yes.

01:32:17.075 --> 01:32:18.107
I'm looking for...

01:32:18.142 --> 01:32:21.044
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.
I'll lock you up.

01:32:21.079 --> 01:32:23.680
I'm looking for Mrs. Carleton Random.

01:32:23.715 --> 01:32:26.615
So is everybody else.
Let me tell you, she's not here.

01:32:26.650 --> 01:32:28.917
- I have reason to believe she is here.
- Who're you?

01:32:28.952 --> 01:32:30.285
Her attorney, Alexander Peabody.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:34.278
I'm Miss Swallow. I'm looking
for a man by the name of Dr. David Huxley.

01:32:34.656 --> 01:32:36.191
Is he here with Mrs. Random?

01:32:36.226 --> 01:32:40.183
Lady, the only folks here is a woman
who keeps saying she's Mrs. Random.

01:32:40.695 --> 01:32:44.688
Then we got a gangster named Bone.
Then we have "Babyface" Horace. Stop it.

01:32:44.765 --> 01:32:46.200
Then... What is it you want?

01:32:46.235 --> 01:32:48.001
I can identify this gentleman.

01:32:48.036 --> 01:32:51.771
You may remember me. I testified
during the breaking of the Borden will.

01:32:51.806 --> 01:32:54.774
Yes, I remember.
I demand to see my client at once.

01:32:54.809 --> 01:32:56.343
Slocum, you may have made a mistake.

01:32:56.378 --> 01:32:58.110
And if you have made a mistake...

01:32:58.145 --> 01:33:01.413
your position as constable in this county
will be in serious jeopardy.

01:33:01.448 --> 01:33:05.406
- Are you sure he's the old lady's attorney?
- Positively.

01:33:05.651 --> 01:33:08.053
Election next week, too.

01:33:08.088 --> 01:33:11.789
Mr. Peabody, just step right inside,
and we'll straighten this thing out.

01:33:11.824 --> 01:33:14.859
As a matter of fact,
we don't make mistakes.

01:33:14.894 --> 01:33:17.395
Here you are.
Is she or ain't she Mrs. Random?

01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:19.730
It's just about time you came.

01:33:19.765 --> 01:33:22.666
Of course she's Mrs. Random.
This is absurd. Open that door.

01:33:22.701 --> 01:33:24.768
- I told you.
- All right. What about him?

01:33:24.803 --> 01:33:27.971
- David, I don't understand...
- Alice, it's just one of those things.

01:33:28.006 --> 01:33:30.339
I can't explain it.
It happened, and here I am.

01:33:30.374 --> 01:33:32.742
Yes, in the last place
I expected to find you.

01:33:32.777 --> 01:33:35.144
I don't like it any better than you do.

01:33:35.179 --> 01:33:36.812
And let that young man out, too.

01:33:36.847 --> 01:33:39.715
Shucks, looks like I got the whole thing
fuddled up.

01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:41.082
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

01:33:41.117 --> 01:33:45.075
You haven't heard the end of this, either.
I... Huxley!

01:33:45.654 --> 01:33:47.956
Why did you throw rocks at me last night?

01:33:47.991 --> 01:33:51.859
This is the young man to whom
you wanted me to donate $1 million...

01:33:51.894 --> 01:33:52.960
for his museum?

01:33:52.995 --> 01:33:55.863
Yes. No, I didn't. I changed my mind.

01:33:55.898 --> 01:33:58.232
David, what have you done?

01:33:58.267 --> 01:34:02.224
Just name anything, and I've done it.

01:34:03.903 --> 01:34:05.338
Joe, what are we gonna tell them?

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:09.331
Tell them the truth. We lost the leopard.

01:34:15.681 --> 01:34:17.282
You the constable around here?

01:34:17.317 --> 01:34:19.918
Until the next election, anyway.
What is it you want?

01:34:19.953 --> 01:34:23.187
- We need some help.
- That's what I'm here for. What is it?

01:34:23.222 --> 01:34:25.489
We're looking for...

01:34:25.524 --> 01:34:28.025
Don't tell me you're looking for a leopard.

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.162
How did you know that?

01:34:31.197 --> 01:34:34.731
- Know what?
- That we're looking for a leopard.

01:34:34.766 --> 01:34:38.724
This has gone far enough.
There are no leopards in the state of...

01:34:43.939 --> 01:34:47.342
- Get down, everybody!
- That's a bad cat. Somebody get a gun.

01:34:47.377 --> 01:34:50.245
Hold on, don't be alarmed.
There's no need to be frightened.

01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.381
Everything's going to be all right.

01:34:52.416 --> 01:34:56.373
Hello, Baby.

01:34:56.417 --> 01:35:00.054
- Is this my leopard?
- Yes. That's Baby.

01:35:00.089 --> 01:35:02.323
He didn't act that way with me.

01:35:02.358 --> 01:35:04.891
Wait a minute. That ain't my leopard.

01:35:04.926 --> 01:35:07.761
Of course it isn't.
That's why I took it out of the truck.

01:35:07.796 --> 01:35:09.429
You never let that one out of the truck.

01:35:09.464 --> 01:35:13.422
You couldn't touch our cat
with a 10-foot pole.

01:35:13.867 --> 01:35:15.401
You mean there's another leopard?

01:35:15.436 --> 01:35:16.736
That's what I'm telling you.

01:35:16.771 --> 01:35:19.305
Our cat came from the circus.
He just clawed a man.

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.806
He's bad.

01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:24.176
My goodness! Susan's out
trying to catch the wrong leopard.

01:35:24.211 --> 01:35:28.168
Poor darling Susan. She's in danger,
and she's helpless without me.

01:35:30.148 --> 01:35:32.250
What's the matter with you?

01:35:32.285 --> 01:35:35.186
Come on.
If you don't want to walk, I'll drag you.

01:35:35.221 --> 01:35:37.421
You've got to get me out of this, Baby.

01:35:37.456 --> 01:35:40.758
What's the matter? You've been slapping
at me the whole way.

01:35:40.793 --> 01:35:44.394
We've got to get in here. You might
as well come without being stubborn...

01:35:44.429 --> 01:35:47.563
because I'm going to drag you in.

01:35:47.598 --> 01:35:51.556
I'm just as determined as you are,
so you might just as well come with me.

01:35:51.868 --> 01:35:55.438
I'm going to drag you in here.

01:35:55.473 --> 01:35:59.430
I don't like jail any more than you do,
but this is where we've got to be.

01:36:07.348 --> 01:36:08.949
Did I fool you this time!

01:36:08.984 --> 01:36:12.119
You thought I was doing the wrong thing,
but I've got him.

01:36:12.154 --> 01:36:16.112
No, you haven't, Susan. Look!

01:36:21.494 --> 01:36:25.487
Boys! Don't leave me in here!

01:36:32.304 --> 01:36:35.841
David, help me!

01:36:35.876 --> 01:36:39.833
Run!

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:45.016
Run while you have the chance!

01:36:45.051 --> 01:36:49.009
- I won't leave you. I love you.
- What?

01:36:58.028 --> 01:36:59.329
Poke him, David.

01:36:59.364 --> 01:37:02.598
Let go, Susan, please.

01:37:02.633 --> 01:37:06.302
Please, go back. Can't you see
I'm trying to get it into the cell?

01:37:06.337 --> 01:37:09.405
Get in there!

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:13.397
Get the keys, Susan!

01:37:13.474 --> 01:37:17.467
Give it to me.

01:37:19.247 --> 01:37:22.015
You're wonderful.

01:37:22.050 --> 01:37:23.951
You're absolutely wonderful.

01:37:23.986 --> 01:37:26.153
You're a hero. You saved my life.

01:37:26.188 --> 01:37:29.056
You'll go down in history.
I've never seen such bravery...

01:37:29.091 --> 01:37:33.048
Did you want to say something?

01:37:33.993 --> 01:37:35.895
What was it?

01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:39.866
David, you've fainted.

01:37:39.901 --> 01:37:42.334
There's nothing else I can say,
except that I'm glad...

01:37:42.369 --> 01:37:45.871
that before our marriage you showed
yourself up in your true colors.

01:37:45.906 --> 01:37:48.306
You're just a butterfly.

01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:52.299
Now I'm a butterfly.

01:38:14.596 --> 01:38:17.432
Where are you going, David?
Don't go up there.

01:38:17.467 --> 01:38:19.902
I want to talk to you. See? I've got it.

01:38:19.937 --> 01:38:22.371
I can't even see you. Now where are you?

01:38:22.406 --> 01:38:23.939
There you are.

01:38:23.974 --> 01:38:27.642
I followed George around for three days
and dug holes with him.

01:38:27.677 --> 01:38:31.635
And then he came and put it in my shoe.
Darling, look!

01:38:32.914 --> 01:38:35.081
David, don't be mad at me.

01:38:35.116 --> 01:38:39.074
Thank you very much.
Put it down on the table and go away.

01:38:39.452 --> 01:38:41.621
I don't want to go away.
I want to talk to you.

01:38:41.656 --> 01:38:43.623
Write me a letter.

01:38:43.658 --> 01:38:46.425
Don't! Go back, Susan!

01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:50.095
Jeepers, it's high up here.

01:38:50.130 --> 01:38:53.299
Please go back down the ladder quietly.

01:38:53.334 --> 01:38:56.301
When I go down,
I'll go down quietly, David...

01:38:56.336 --> 01:38:58.569
but I want to find out something first.

01:38:58.604 --> 01:39:01.105
Why did you run up that ladder
when I came in here?

01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.141
If you must know, I'm afraid of you.

01:39:03.176 --> 01:39:07.133
If you're afraid of me,
that's the same as if...

01:39:07.978 --> 01:39:10.681
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.

01:39:10.716 --> 01:39:13.583
Every time you say that,
something happens.

01:39:13.618 --> 01:39:17.019
Please go down because you've already
cost the museum $1 million.

01:39:17.054 --> 01:39:21.012
I haven't. I've got the $1 million.
Aunt Elizabeth gave it to me...

01:39:21.324 --> 01:39:24.994
and I'm going to give it to you
for the museum.

01:39:25.029 --> 01:39:27.063
I'm sure they'll be very pleased.

01:39:27.098 --> 01:39:28.630
Aren't you pleased, David?

01:39:28.665 --> 01:39:31.599
- Yes, I suppose so, but...
- It's too late, isn't it?

01:39:31.634 --> 01:39:34.169
I've made a mess of everything, haven't I?

01:39:34.204 --> 01:39:37.706
I was so happy
when I found the bone this morning.

01:39:37.741 --> 01:39:39.740
If I could only make you understand.

01:39:39.775 --> 01:39:43.277
All that happened, happened because
I was trying to keep you near me.

01:39:43.312 --> 01:39:46.213
I just did anything
that came into my head.

01:39:46.248 --> 01:39:47.614
I'm so sorry.

01:39:47.649 --> 01:39:49.449
I ought to thank you.

01:39:49.484 --> 01:39:51.017
- Thank me?
- Yes.

01:39:51.052 --> 01:39:52.719
For what?

01:39:52.754 --> 01:39:56.712
I've just discovered that was the best day
I ever had in my whole life.

01:39:57.590 --> 01:40:01.593
- You don't mean it?
- I've never had a better time.

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:04.496
- But I was there.
- That's what made it so good.

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:07.532
- Did you really have a good time?
- Yes, I did!

01:40:07.567 --> 01:40:10.001
That's wonderful.
Do you realize what that means?

01:40:10.036 --> 01:40:12.770
That means that you must like me
a little bit.

01:40:12.805 --> 01:40:14.238
- It's more than that.
- Is it?

01:40:14.273 --> 01:40:16.273
Yes. I love you, I think.

01:40:16.308 --> 01:40:20.265
That's wonderful because I love you, too.

01:40:20.377 --> 01:40:22.012
Stop rocking, David.

01:40:22.047 --> 01:40:26.005
I'm not rocking. I...

01:40:34.223 --> 01:40:38.216
Please, the brontosaurus!
Four years' work went into this.

01:40:48.403 --> 01:40:52.395
- Look out, Susan, something's going to...
- I'm falling!

01:41:00.514 --> 01:41:03.783
Hold on, Susan! Hold on! Don't let go!

01:41:03.818 --> 01:41:06.852
David, look what I've done.

01:41:06.887 --> 01:41:10.845
I'm so sorry.

01:41:11.457 --> 01:41:15.060
David, can you ever forgive me?

01:41:15.095 --> 01:41:17.796
You can, and you still love me.

01:41:17.831 --> 01:41:21.789
- Susan, that...
- You do.
