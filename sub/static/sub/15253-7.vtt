00:00.200 --> 00:02.100
I'm Chuck. Here's a few
things that you might

00:02.767 --> 00:05.133
need to know. I'm the magnet
for bad guys? Are you kidding me?

00:05.199 --> 00:06.499
I cannot believe that
you would bring me here

00:06.500 --> 00:07.866
and use me as a human target.

00:07.867 --> 00:09.465
Everything about
Bartowski's mother's life

00:09.466 --> 00:11.299
is a fake. I
should've grabbed her

00:11.300 --> 00:12.799
before she dropped
off the map again.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.832
My mom, she left a message.

00:13.833 --> 00:15.165
She wants to see
Ellie tonight

00:15.166 --> 00:17.066
before she goes back
undercover.

00:18.733 --> 00:20.232
Chuck!
No! No!

00:20.233 --> 00:21.499
Let her go!

00:21.500 --> 00:23.867
Stop! Stop! You have
no idea what's going on.

00:23.934 --> 00:25.934
You mom isn't the spy
you think she is.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.066
Ellie,'m sorry,
but Mom is not coming.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.899
Why does she keep
doing this to us?

00:29.900 --> 00:31.800
Because she's a spy.

BECKMAN
Colonel Casey,

00:44.199 --> 00:46.600
the Project Isis file
you discover was authentic.

00:46.667 --> 00:48.967
Mary Bartowski, alias Frost,

00:49.034 --> 00:52.066
was a CIA agent working
undeover for Volkoff

00:52.133 --> 00:53.832
until 20 years ago,
when she turned

00:53.833 --> 00:55.867
and we never heard
from her again.

00:55.934 --> 00:58.133
Agent Walker, you made
the right decision

00:58.199 --> 01:00.099
by bringing in Frost.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.099
Agent Walker?

01:02.166 --> 01:04.066
Walker.

01:04.066 --> 01:07.099
Oh, uh, yes, General,
what's the next step?

01:07.166 --> 01:11.000
We're moving Frost to
a black site facility tomorrow.

01:11.066 --> 01:13.500
That means no one is to see her,

01:13.567 --> 01:15.332
especially Bartowski.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.667
Agent Walker, I suspect
I can trust you

01:17.733 --> 01:19.165
to keep an eye on Chuck.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.699
Of course, yes.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.633
Good. How is he
handling all this?

01:23.700 --> 01:25.566
Uh, he...

01:25.567 --> 01:27.299
He's fine, General.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.165
Calm, actually.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.332
Very calm.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.666
Calm?!

01:31.667 --> 01:33.232
How am I supposed
to stay calm?

01:33.233 --> 01:34.599
Sarah, I had everything
under control.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.700
My mom was going to meet Ellie
for five minutes

01:36.767 --> 01:38.132
and then disappear forever.

01:38.133 --> 01:40.567
I asked you to trust me,
and you went behind my back.

01:40.633 --> 01:43.133
Why is it so hard
for you to believe in me?

01:43.199 --> 01:44.365
How was that?

01:44.366 --> 01:46.667
You were certainly passionate.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.499
But I wouldn't use the "F" word.

01:48.500 --> 01:50.232
I didn't. No? No.

01:50.233 --> 01:52.500
Maybe just seemed that way
because you were so intense.

01:52.567 --> 01:55.166
And didn't Sarah have proof that
your mom was working for Volkoff?

01:55.233 --> 01:56.732
Whe side are
you on, buddy?

01:56.733 --> 01:58.566
Chuck, do I have
to pick a side? Yeah

01:58.567 --> 02:00.265
Then you.
Well, no.

02:00.266 --> 02:01.866
I don't...
I don't know.

02:01.867 --> 02:03.599
Sarah and I have never really
had a fight before,

02:03.600 --> 02:04.999
so... Not-Not

02:05.000 --> 02:06.399
a real one, not like this.

02:06.400 --> 02:07.399
I hear you.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.098
I hear you.
You know, a couple's

02:09.098 --> 02:11.333
first fight actually sets the
tone for all future arguments.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.966
Trust me.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.399
I'm going through it
right now myself.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.265
You and Alex?

02:15.266 --> 02:16.766
No. Me and Casey, actually.

02:16.767 --> 02:17.899
Hmm.

02:17.900 --> 02:19.065
So, I'm just...

02:19.066 --> 02:20.232
You know,
I'm taking some time.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.566
Cool off,
clear the old mechanm.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.132
You should do the same thing
with Sarah.

02:23.133 --> 02:24.599
You're probably right.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.800
I mean, it's certainly not
getting me any closer to proving

02:26.867 --> 02:28.165
my mom's innocence. Yeah.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.366
My dad spent his whole life
searching for her, and

02:30.433 --> 02:31.599
there's nothing in here

02:31.600 --> 02:33.432
that can help us prove
she's not a traitor.

02:33.433 --> 02:34.732
You're telling me. Holy cow!

02:34.733 --> 02:36.098
This technology is ancient.

02:36.099 --> 02:38.700
But we can clean her up a little
bit and sell her on Ebay.

02:38.767 --> 02:39.933
What do you think?

02:39.934 --> 02:41.232
What, are you joking?

02:41.233 --> 02:42.899
Nobody's going
to buy a Phalanx XR-12 computer.

02:42.900 --> 02:45.266
I mean the thing only takes
triangle-shaped disks.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.899
Whoa.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.699
And this is everything, huh?

02:48.700 --> 02:50.198
What do you mean?
Well, ur father

02:50.199 --> 02:52.133
left all this stuff for you,
but is there a possibility

02:52.199 --> 02:54.099
he might have left
something for Ellie, too?

02:55.867 --> 02:57.967
What do you mean,
left something?

02:58.034 --> 02:59.365
I don't know. Information?

02:59.366 --> 03:02.000
Something about Mo maybe.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.567
You know, Dad used to send me
those coded messages

03:04.633 --> 03:07.667
in the classifieds, but
I haven't found anything since

03:07.767 --> 03:09.365
before he passed awa

03:09.366 --> 03:10.933
What is this about, Chuck?

03:10.934 --> 03:14.233
I guess it's just all this stuff
with Mom.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.266
I was hoping that Dad might
have left us se answers.

03:16.333 --> 03:18.033
I wish that we knew
both of them betr,

03:18.034 --> 03:20.767
but since the only person
who can give us answers

03:20.833 --> 03:23.567
is locked away in a CIA base,

03:23.633 --> 03:26.733
it's not like we can
just waltz in there and ask her.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.567
Right. No. Yeah, can't.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.733
hooshing)

03:35.800 --> 03:36.966
Tom, Jerry.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.198
Good to see you guys again.

03:38.199 --> 03:39.399
Keep up the good work.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.933
Just keep doing what
you're doing, you know?

03:40.934 --> 03:42.967
Have fun with it. That's
what I try to do, anyway.

03:43.034 --> 03:44.265
Hey, Ginger.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.166
Wow, Casey, a lot of
new faces down here, huh?

03:46.201 --> 03:47.799
Huh? We should have a
mixer or something.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.132
You know, a little
get-to-know-u.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.299
We can exchange

03:50.300 --> 03:52.200
fake names
and backgrounds.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.700
Okay, great. Good times.

03:58.166 --> 04:00.199
Chuck?

04:03.900 --> 04:05.867
Sneaking into
your own home...

04:07.433 --> 04:09.533
Oh...

04:09.600 --> 04:11.198
Morgan.

04:11.199 --> 04:13.099
How long have you been hiding
behind that door?

04:13.134 --> 04:14.499
An uncomfortably
long time, actually,

04:14.500 --> 04:15.933
but-but that's not the point.

04:15.934 --> 04:17.132
Thpoint is this.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.065
You and Chuck are in
a relationship crisis.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.300
Crisis? Did he say something
to you? Yeah, actually.

04:21.366 --> 04:22.198
He-He told me everything.

04:22.199 --> 04:24.099
And...

04:24.099 --> 04:26.867
I think he just needs
some time to cool off.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.466
But he always wants
to talk about... anything.

04:29.533 --> 04:31.800
What do you want me to say
here? I mean, you did go behind

04:31.867 --> 04:32.966
his back, have his
mother arrested.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.065
I was just trying
to protect him.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.632
Yeah. Ellie said
the same thing.

04:35.633 --> 04:36.933
He told Ellie, too?

04:36.934 --> 04:38.399
You know, contrary
to popular bief,

04:38.400 --> 04:39.899
we think that there
is a heart of gold

04:39.900 --> 04:41.065
underneath this
cold exterior.

04:41.066 --> 04:42.465
Morgan, please don't
touch my chest.

04:42.466 --> 04:43.999
Oh, gosh, yeah. No, I meant that

04:44.000 --> 04:45.799
completely non-sexual. You
know what? This is ridiculous.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.700
Neither of us should be
sneaking around at all.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.900
If I could just talk to Chuck,
everything woulde okay

04:49.967 --> 04:51.867
Where is he, anyway?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.034
You shouldn't be here.

05:13.099 --> 05:14.899
I need your help.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.165
Why?

05:16.166 --> 05:18.133
CIA thin I'm a traitor.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.900
If I'm gonna help
you, I need the truth

06:12.967 --> 06:15.266
this time, okay?
Casey found a file

06:15.366 --> 06:18.000
that said that Project Isis
was abandoned 20 years ago,

06:18.067 --> 06:21.600
you betrayed the CIA
and joinedorces with Volkoff.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.700
Yes, that much is true.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.867
What?!
20 years ago,

06:25.933 --> 06:29.166
Volkoff had started to suspect
that I was working with the CIA.

06:29.233 --> 06:32.333
He was one step away from
finding out my true identity.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.300
That you're
a Bartowski?

06:34.366 --> 06:35.766
That I was a mother.

06:35.767 --> 06:37.432
So I did
the only thing I could.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.866
I admitted I was CIA,

06:38.867 --> 06:41.166
and I told Volkoff
I wanted to join him.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.166
I broke all ties
with the ancy,

06:43.233 --> 06:44.932
and I went to work for MI6.

06:44.933 --> 06:46.365
Tell me who call,

06:46.366 --> 06:47.999
and I will fix
all of this.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.332
No, it's not that simple.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.099
Volkoff has sources athe CIA.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.666
That's why I had to leave.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.133
A 20-year mission

06:54.134 --> 06:56.667
wille wast
if he gets wind of any of this.

06:56.733 --> 06:57.932
But you can trust me.

06:57.933 --> 07:00.100
You're not gonna tell
your girlfrid this time?

07:00.166 --> 07:01.432
That's not gonna
be too hard,

07:01.433 --> 07:02.932
considering we're
in a fight right now

07:02.933 --> 07:04.833
and not really on
speaking terms.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.733
Do you

07:07.800 --> 07:10.266
want to...

07:10.333 --> 07:11.666
talk about it, or...?

07:11.667 --> 07:12.899
No, that's okay.
Thank you.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.399
You think that being
boyfriend and girlfriend,

07:14.400 --> 07:16.265
she could trust me
from time to time.

07:16.266 --> 07:17.599
You know what?

07:17.600 --> 07:19.700
It doesn't matter. Yes,
I can keep it a cret.

07:19.767 --> 07:21.733
Good.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.633
There is one person at MI6

07:24.700 --> 07:27.900
who can confirm that everything
I'm telling you is true.

07:27.967 --> 07:29.465
His name is Gregory Tuttle.

07:29.466 --> 07:30.832
He's my handler.

07:30.833 --> 07:33.266
We have a preset meeting
for today at 2:00

07:33.333 --> 07:34.666
at the Old Duke Tavern.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.532
Go there and give him
thisode.

07:36.533 --> 07:38.183
Per fas et nefas.

07:38.184 --> 07:39.766
Per fas et nefas?

07:39.767 --> 07:41.066
Per fas et nefas.
Nefas.

07:41.067 --> 07:42.399
Okay.
Okay?

07:42.400 --> 07:44.767
It's the only way
he'll know he can trust you.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.667
And Chuck, he doesn't know
that you're my son.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.365
Nobody does.

07:51.366 --> 07:53.600
Okay, I got it.

07:56.967 --> 08:00.034
I'm sorry.
The code one more time?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.265
Babe, what is all this?

08:06.266 --> 08:07.432
What are you doing?

08:07.433 --> 08:08.899
I know that this
sounds crazy,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.967
but what if my dad did leave me
a message in the classied ads?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.766
Hon, I thought
you decided months ago

08:13.767 --> 08:15.066
that there was nothing here.

08:15.067 --> 08:18.034
I know, but I just found
out that my mom is a spy,

08:18.100 --> 08:19.799
and Chuck said
something today.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.365
This can't be
just a coincidence.

08:21.366 --> 08:24.134
Look, every day since
he's passed away, there has been

08:24.199 --> 08:25.599
an ad r a
convertible Mustang.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.500
Ell, if there was
a hidden code here,

08:27.533 --> 08:29.165
you would have found it by now.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.499
I don't know.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.400
There's-There's something
about it.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.500
Could it be my dad's
last msage to me?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.500
Somethinimportant?

08:41.067 --> 08:42.899
y.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.066
Yes?

08:44.067 --> 08:45.599
Because I-I value
our relationship,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.967
John, I need
to be frank with you.

08:48.034 --> 08:49.332
We are in a fight.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.599
Ok.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.900
Really? Okay? That's all
you have to say to me?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.365
My shift ended
two minutes ago.

08:54.366 --> 08:55.599
You lied to me, okay?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.000
You never told me that
the Project Isis file had proof

08:58.067 --> 08:59.967
that Mrs. Bartowski
was working for Volkoff.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.565
Now, okay, you asked me
to shadow yo

09:01.566 --> 09:04.199
to make me a better spy,
but how am I supposed to do at

09:04.266 --> 09:05.532
if I'm always the magnet?

09:05.533 --> 09:07.099
Or having to wait in a van?

09:07.100 --> 09:11.067
Or bng lied to by my
partner and... friend?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.034
Hmm.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.600
Hey. Hey, Morg, I'm
so glad I found you.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.034
Buddy, I need your help on
super top secret mission.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.067
Do I get to parachute out
of a plane on a wild horse?

09:22.134 --> 09:23.732
No, you do not,

09:23.733 --> 09:25.733
because nobody
ever does.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.565
But you do get to
wear aearpiece.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.198
Sold.

09:29.199 --> 09:31.099
Yeah.

09:38.466 --> 09:40.400
Morgan, buddy, remember
we're undercover.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.400
A little subtlety
goes a long way.

09:42.466 --> 09:43.866
Copy that, Chuck-

09:43.867 --> 09:45.066
oh, Charles.

09:45.067 --> 09:46.866
Okay, so, earpiece
is in place,

09:46.867 --> 09:48.532
and I believe
is working.

09:48.533 --> 09:49.799
Yes? Hello?
Hello. Check.

09:49.800 --> 09:50.966
Stop touching it.

09:50.967 --> 09:52.465
By touching it,
u're drawing attention

09:52.466 --> 09:54.599
to the fact
that you're wearing it, okay?

09:54.634 --> 09:56.733
You are to be my eyes
and ears on this.

09:56.800 --> 09:59.067
I need you to sit
at the bar unnoticed.

09:59.134 --> 10:01.700
Tuttle can't know that
anyone came with me here. Ready?

10:01.767 --> 10:03.733
Break.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.165
MORGAN
Do me a favor.

10:12.166 --> 10:13.599
Uh, can you make out the board

10:13.600 --> 10:15.232
with the specials
from where you're sitting?

10:15.233 --> 10:16.666
Okay, let me say it again.

10:16.667 --> 10:17.799
We're undercover.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.198
We're not here
to order food.

10:19.199 --> 10:21.066
And these earpieces are not
for personal conversations.

10:21.067 --> 10:23.067
I got you. Just remind me
to tell you

10:23.166 --> 10:24.499
what Sarah thought
of your fight.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.566
Sarah? You talked to Sarah?

10:26.633 --> 10:27.999
What did Sarah say?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.599
Wh-Wh-Whoa, what are you
so nervous about? It's fine.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.932
I did all the talking, okay?

10:30.933 --> 10:32.465
Kept it simple and concise,
and basically

10:32.466 --> 10:34.099
explained toer
that by not believing in you,

10:34.100 --> 10:35.332
she betrayed your trust
and yo family.

10:35.333 --> 10:36.666
Your words, not mine.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.667
Morgan. Morgan,
why would you...?

10:39.733 --> 10:41.365
That was supposed to stay

10:41.366 --> 10:42.666
between us.

10:42.667 --> 10:44.900
Yeah, okay.
One second, buddy. Holon. Ow.

10:44.967 --> 10:46.699
Ow. Ow. Sorry.
Hold on one second.

10:46.700 --> 10:48.600
This thing's not working right.

10:49.199 --> 10:51.099
It's like...

10:59.433 --> 11:01.333
One second, Chuck.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.867
Oh, my gosh.

11:18.667 --> 11:21.566
Cheers.

11:27.199 --> 11:28.399
Just one- I just have to...

11:28.400 --> 11:30.300
Mm-hmm.

11:33.366 --> 11:34.499
I hate to make

11:34.500 --> 11:36.165
a scene.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.034
But I'll rip your throat out
with this plastic fork

11:39.100 --> 11:40.932
if you don't tell me who you are

11:40.933 --> 11:42.666
and why you're wearing
an earpiece.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.567
Well, that certainly
would a scene, wouldn't it?

11:44.600 --> 11:45.766
Okay, okay.

11:45.767 --> 11:47.532
Wait, wait, wait. Ha, ha.

11:47.533 --> 11:48.799
You're Tuttle.
You're Tuttle, right?

11:48.800 --> 11:51.000
You're Tuttle, and I have
a code word r you.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.198
It's Latin,

11:52.199 --> 11:55.000
and it's...

11:55.067 --> 11:56.198
What is it?

11:56.199 --> 11:58.099
Just great.
Now I need to dry this out.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.699
I got it, I got it.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.034
Per fas et nefas.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.232
Oh, thank God.

12:19.233 --> 12:20.932
Whew.

12:20.933 --> 12:22.332
Frost sent you.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.165
I just want
to apologize for

12:24.166 --> 12:26.066
questioning you
in such a harsh tone

12:26.067 --> 12:27.465
and-and of course
for threatening

12:27.466 --> 12:29.366
to rip out your throat.

12:31.566 --> 12:33.667
I wouldn't even know
how do that.

12:33.733 --> 12:36.034
You seemed very
convinng to me.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.800
That's kind of you,
but I'm just a handler for MI6.

12:38.867 --> 12:41.000
I'm not a trained field agent,

12:41.067 --> 12:42.967
you know, field ready,
as they say.

12:44.433 --> 12:46.066
Okay, time's up, Matlock.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.165
There's a limit, all right?

12:47.166 --> 12:48.265
Let's go, dry it up.

12:48.266 --> 12:50.133
Polyester, so it's
really absorbent.

12:50.134 --> 12:51.165
Good?

12:51.166 --> 12:52.432
huckles):
Okay, thank you.

12:52.433 --> 12:54.333
Come again.

12:55.067 --> 12:56.365
Wait.

12:56.366 --> 12:58.266
Why did Frost send you?

12:58.299 --> 13:00.400
Where is she?

13:00.466 --> 13:04.233
My name is Charles
Carmichael.

13:04.299 --> 13:06.566
I'm her ally
at the CIA.

13:06.633 --> 13:08.533
I have her in
custody right now.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.967
If she's in stody, then
Volkoff will be looking for her.

13:11.034 --> 13:13.067
We don't have much time.

13:13.134 --> 13:14.198
You'll start with

13:14.199 --> 13:16.500
whoever she was last seewith.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.833
Please don't tell me it was you.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.165
Oh...

13:22.166 --> 13:24.066
Bloody hell.

13:29.233 --> 13:30.666
CHUCK
Morgan...

13:30.667 --> 13:32.867
help.

13:39.067 --> 13:40.967
Testing, testing.
Chuck, I'm back.

13:41.034 --> 13:42.332
We're back in business, buddy.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.466
Let's just...

13:44.533 --> 13:47.166
No. No, no, no. What?

13:47.233 --> 13:50.233
No, no, no. Hold...

13:52.233 --> 13:55.233
You got to be kidding me.

14:05.033 --> 14:07.233
Hello, Agent
Carmhael.

14:07.300 --> 14:09.500
May I call
you Charles?

14:09.566 --> 14:11.733
Sure, yeah, that's-
Are we on a plane?

14:11.800 --> 14:13.166
Yes.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.067
Been kidnapped by
Volkoff's operatives.

14:15.900 --> 14:17.565
Nasty buggers.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.466
They must think
we've got Frost.

14:31.067 --> 14:32.632
What are you
looking at?

14:32.633 --> 14:33.698
Not that scar.

14:33.699 --> 14:34.865
Or that scar.

14:34.866 --> 14:36.598
Neither one of those scars.

14:36.599 --> 14:39.866
Or your, or your,
or your mole, mole.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.366
That is a
beauty mark.

14:41.367 --> 14:43.866
Which is what I meant
by-by "mole": beauty mark.

14:43.933 --> 14:45.132
Tomato, tomahto.

14:45.133 --> 14:47.033
You're so stunning,
I can't even look away.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.200
You're going to tell me
what you've done with Frost.

14:53.033 --> 14:56.133
And you're going
to do it now.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.199
Um..

14:57.200 --> 14:58.399
He doesn't know anything.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.865
And you do?

14:59.866 --> 15:02.566
I- I know that
if you use those tweezers,

15:02.633 --> 15:04.833
on those rather large hairs
in your nostls,

15:04.900 --> 15:07.167
it would work wonders.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.434
I mean, when was
the last time

15:09.500 --> 15:11.400
a man expressed
interest in you?

15:12.566 --> 15:14.466
Hmm? Be honest.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.000
What are you doing?

15:20.067 --> 15:21.299
Torture 101, my friend.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.166
I've read every manual
on theubject.

15:23.167 --> 15:25.733
Weaken the enemy emotionally,
then take the power.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.766
Just what could she possibly do
with those tiny little tweezers?

15:28.833 --> 15:31.200
No, no, no, nono!
Please, stop! Stop, stop!

15:31.267 --> 15:32.266
I'll tell you
everything you want.

15:32.267 --> 15:33.598
No, don'
My home

15:33.599 --> 15:35.232
address is 17 Tally Place.
My dog's name is Kipper.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.665
And I had my first
sexual experience

15:36.666 --> 15:38.566
watching Lawrence of Arabia.

15:40.333 --> 15:41.366
I'm not proud of it.

15:41.367 --> 15:43.699
I- I came from a broken home.

15:43.766 --> 15:46.766
All I want to know
is what you've done

15:46.833 --> 15:48.733
with Frost.

15:49.467 --> 15:52.766
You are going to regret that.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.166
I think I already do.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.067
Look, I-I don't know
anythi, all right?

15:56.167 --> 15:58.333
One second Chuck was there,
and then he was just ge.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.733
All right? We just did what
Mrs. Bartowski told us to do.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.866
I don't understand why
he keeps trusting her.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.332
She just hurts him.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.699
Not anymore. She's gonna
tell us what we want to know.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.433
Yeah. Well, just let me...

16:08.434 --> 16:11.000
Uh-uh. That's why we
keep you in e van.

16:11.067 --> 16:13.033
You stay her

16:18.833 --> 16:20.332
Maybe I should try one
last thing from the manuals.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.233
Please don't.

16:25.599 --> 16:28.067
The Swedish slip.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.300
It actually worked.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.966
And I didn't have to
break my tmbs.

16:33.033 --> 16:35.167
What do we do now?

16:35.233 --> 16:37.766
* *

16:41.167 --> 16:43.300
Oh, cool.
A tiny weapon stand-off.

16:43.367 --> 16:45.267
En garde.

16:45.966 --> 16:47.632
Ah...

16:47.633 --> 16:49.533
oth grunting)

16:58.900 --> 17:00.800
Ah! Oh.
Hello there.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.465
A little help
here? Anything?

17:25.467 --> 17:27.434
Uh...

17:29.133 --> 17:31.033
Here! Catch!

17:42.200 --> 17:43.932
Enough.

17:43.933 --> 17:46.434
You're gonna tell us
where Chuck is now.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.400
I want to see my daughter.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.832
We're not having a discussion
about what you want.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.266
Chuck came here

17:51.267 --> 17:54.000
this morning because he
trusted you, and now he's gone.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.300
If he's with my haler,
I know he's safe.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.032
ght, then why
hasn't he called in?

17:58.033 --> 18:00.333
Perhaps he doesn't want
to see you.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.232
Chuck told me about the fight.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.367
Okay, listen.
I can't protect

18:05.434 --> 18:07.766
your son if I don't
know where he is.

18:07.833 --> 18:09.299
I am trying to protect him, too.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.833
Which is why I am not saying
a word to either of you.

18:11.900 --> 18:15.666
The only one I know
I can trust is my son.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.766
Mrs. Bartowski.

18:19.833 --> 18:22.200
Morgan Grimes?

18:22.267 --> 18:24.167
You...
Wait.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.067
I haven't seen you since
you were nine years old.

18:31.133 --> 18:32.565
You want to know something?
I haven't had

18:32.566 --> 18:34.800
a decent Rice Krispy Treat
since.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.167
What are you doing here?

18:40.566 --> 18:43.233
Kind of a long story,
but the thing is,

18:43.300 --> 18:45.766
it's a little bit my fault
that Chuck's gone.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.699
So, if you could tell me where
he is, I'll make sure

18:48.766 --> 18:50.266
that they give you
want you want, okay?

18:50.267 --> 18:53.434
I promise you, you will
get to see Ellie, but...

18:53.500 --> 18:55.400
you have ttell us.

18:57.900 --> 19:01.067
You can trust me, Mrs. B.

19:04.966 --> 19:06.900
If you take me to see Ellie,

19:06.966 --> 19:09.200
I will tell you where Chuck is.

19:09.267 --> 19:11.032
We can't get in the cockpit.

19:11.033 --> 19:11.999
You find any
parachutes?

19:12.000 --> 19:14.833
I found one.
Oh, Charles.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.433
Girlfriend's moving.

19:16.434 --> 19:17.965
Hurry up. We got to find
another parachute.

19:17.966 --> 19:19.366
There's not another one.
I looked everywhere.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.099
What-Wt are we going to do?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.865
I'm just taking the
piss out of you.

19:22.866 --> 19:24.533
Of course there's
another parachute. Oh...

19:24.534 --> 19:27.633
Whoever heard of a plane
carrying only one parachute?

19:29.400 --> 19:33.267
There we go.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.865
You okay?
Yeah.

19:34.866 --> 19:36.132
It's just, it's so...

19:36.133 --> 19:37.765
thrillg.

19:37.766 --> 19:39.933
It reminds me of that
great episode of Alias.

19:40.966 --> 19:42.866
I loved that show.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.099
You ready?

19:45.100 --> 19:47.000
Ye, as ready as I'll ever be.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.766
Let's do something fantastic.

20:18.866 --> 20:20.132
What...?

20:20.133 --> 20:21.199
Oh, Charles.
You're up.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.433
How did we...

20:23.500 --> 20:24.765
How did we get here?

20:24.766 --> 20:26.165
Well, it was really exciting

20:26.166 --> 20:27.366
until you knocked
yourself unconscious

20:27.367 --> 20:28.366
when we landed.

20:28.367 --> 20:29.633
Luckily, I was able to get us

20:29.634 --> 20:30.798
into the back
of this sheep truck.

20:30.799 --> 20:32.432
Well done. Well done. Well done.

20:32.433 --> 20:33.898
Where are we, uh-
Where are we going?

20:33.899 --> 20:36.467
Well, this lot is going to
the lamb chop factory,

20:36.533 --> 20:38.399
so don't say anything
abt mint sauce.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.798
Oh, um, it's all right.

20:39.799 --> 20:41.566
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

20:41.567 --> 20:44.766
We are going
to the City of Angels

20:44.799 --> 20:47.133
to get thentel
that will clear Frost.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.400
That great news.

20:49.467 --> 20:50.865
Now, I hope you don't
mind me asking,

20:50.866 --> 20:53.000
but why are you so intent
on helping Frost?

20:54.966 --> 20:58.066
You're not...
giving her one, e you?

20:58.133 --> 20:59.999
Giving her one what?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.267
Oh, giving-giving her one?
No, no, no! I would...

21:02.333 --> 21:03.666
I would ver
give her one.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.232
Simp just, no.

21:05.233 --> 21:09.000
We have a very
professional relationship.

21:09.066 --> 21:10.532
You know? Um...

21:10.533 --> 21:11.633
Plus, I have a
girlfriend, anay.

21:11.634 --> 21:12.999
Good for you.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.199
Yeah, ye.
Good, yeah.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.765
Good, normally.
Usually, it's good.

21:15.766 --> 21:17.799
It must be really hard
being a field agent

21:17.866 --> 21:19.232
and having
a relationship.

21:19.233 --> 21:21.667
Especially
when s's a spy, too.

21:21.734 --> 21:24.833
Well, that would bring i
a whole host of complications.

21:24.899 --> 21:26.199
Tell me about it.
You know? I an,

21:26.200 --> 21:27.399
we're right in
the middle of our first fight.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.633
Oh, I don't mean to...
Please.

21:28.634 --> 21:30.534
No, I'd like to talk about it.

21:30.567 --> 21:33.066
You see, it all began
a few years ago...

21:38.533 --> 21:40.433
She kns you're coming.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.333
Okay.
No.

21:53.133 --> 21:55.333
Come in.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.066
Eleanor.

22:10.533 --> 22:13.766
I'm sorry, Ellie.
I have to stay.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.367
That's okay. I understand.

22:26.267 --> 22:27.432
Lemonade?

22:27.433 --> 22:31.367
at would be lovely.
Thk you.

22:42.200 --> 22:46.233
I'm sorry you have
to see me like this.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.133
Things are cplicated
right now,

22:49.200 --> 22:50.633
but I wanted to see you,

22:50.634 --> 22:53.300
st you and me.

22:55.033 --> 22:57.600
I don't know what I'm ing
with these coasters.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.166
I don't... I don't even
use coasters. I don't...

23:02.866 --> 23:05.233
It's okay.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.000
You're all grown up.

23:14.899 --> 23:17.000
I mean, I know
that's obvious,

23:17.066 --> 23:20.133
but when I think of you,

23:20.200 --> 23:22.933
I still see a gangly
little girl,

23:23.000 --> 23:24.933
too tall for her age,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.267
unsure how she fits
into her own skin.

23:31.799 --> 23:34.899
* *

23:34.966 --> 23:39.799
Your dad and I used to take you
for drives in his burgundy

23:39.866 --> 23:41.499
'68 Mustang.

23:41.500 --> 23:45.766
You would sit between us
with your legs curled up.

23:45.833 --> 23:47.866
Do you remember?

23:53.200 --> 23:55.467
I can't believe I forgot.

23:55.533 --> 23:58.766
I remember, uh...

24:00.166 --> 24:03.100
I remember those
blue leather seats.

24:05.133 --> 24:08.899
Your dad special ordered
those blue leather seats.

24:11.433 --> 24:14.533
Watching you sleep
in-beten us

24:14.600 --> 24:17.866
on those long drives

24:17.933 --> 24:20.766
was one of my favoritehings.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.634
I justant to know
what happened.

24:29.700 --> 24:32.066
I want to know the truth.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.799
I guess it all begins
with a scientist.

24:49.866 --> 24:51.432
His code name was Orion.

24:51.433 --> 24:55.133
But his real name
was Stephen Bartowski.

24:58.933 --> 25:01.000
* *

25:13.734 --> 25:16.200
* *

25:16.267 --> 25:18.734
I wish that telling you
that I did this

25:18.799 --> 25:22.066
all r you and Chuck
made a difference.

25:22.133 --> 25:24.766
But I know it doesn't.

25:24.833 --> 25:27.400
And...

25:31.667 --> 25:32.898
Sorry.

25:32.899 --> 25:34.566
We have to go.

25:34.567 --> 25:36.533
Okay.

25:39.567 --> 25:42.799
* *

26:08.799 --> 26:10.566
* *

26:10.567 --> 26:12.634
Thank you.

26:20.066 --> 26:22.866
You kept your end of
the bargain. I'll keep mine.

26:22.933 --> 26:25.667
I know you don't think I care
for my family, but I do.

26:25.734 --> 26:27.667
If your MI6 handler
actually exists,

26:27.734 --> 26:29.332
tell him to bring
Chuck here.

26:29.333 --> 26:31.433
Thers a relay station
that I call in to.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.700
If my handler has
posted his location,

26:33.766 --> 26:35.232
I can take you there.

26:35.233 --> 26:37.833
Once he sees me,
he'll know he n trust you.

26:37.899 --> 26:39.966
Make the call.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.000
Let's go.

26:50.667 --> 26:52.866
All the intel we need

26:52.933 --> 26:55.500
to prove Frost's
an MI6 agent

26:55.567 --> 26:57.533
is on the series
of disks in that

26:57.600 --> 26:59.266
safety deposit box.

26:59.267 --> 27:00.599
Sir?

27:00.600 --> 27:02.567
Thank you.

27:09.133 --> 27:11.333
There it is.

27:15.866 --> 27:17.466
Babe, are you okay?

27:17.467 --> 27:19.199
I got home as
soon as I could.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.532
How'd everything go
with your mom?

27:20.533 --> 27:22.433
She said something
when we were talking.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.165
She told me a-a story

27:24.166 --> 27:26.533
about an old car that
my dad used to have.

27:26.600 --> 27:30.433
A 1968 convertle
Mustang.

27:31.866 --> 27:34.400
With blue leather seats.

27:34.467 --> 27:37.200
This isn't a code, Devon.
This is a real car.

27:37.267 --> 27:39.734
And we're gog to go get it.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.400
Quickly.

27:46.333 --> 27:47.399
Chuck!

27:47.400 --> 27:49.165
Sarah? What are you
twdoing here?

27:49.166 --> 27:50.566
I thought Beckman
gave you orders...

27:50.567 --> 27:51.666
I thought you were
in trouble.

27:51.667 --> 27:52.666
Oh, Agent Frost.

27:52.667 --> 27:54.466
I'm so glad you're okay.

27:54.467 --> 27:56.299
Tuttle.
You have the disks?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.932
Oh, yeah. We're halfway there.

27:57.933 --> 28:00.033
These will prove
that I am not a traitor?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.367
Yes, but there's
a little problem.

28:02.433 --> 28:05.000
Um, these dis
can only be played

28:05.066 --> 28:06.366
on a special computer.

28:06.367 --> 28:08.267
MI6 has got one in London.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.233
Wait a minute.
No, no, no, no.

28:10.300 --> 28:13.367
These disks are for a
Phalanx XR-12 computer.

28:13.433 --> 28:16.367
We don't have to go to London.
I know of one here, in L.A.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.599
Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

28:17.600 --> 28:18.633
Let's!

28:18.634 --> 28:20.132
Frost isn't going anywhere.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.367
Beckman's orders were clear.
I'm king her back to Castle.

28:22.433 --> 28:24.533
No, no. Sarah, you
can't. We're so close.

28:27.833 --> 28:29.366
Nobody move!

28:29.367 --> 28:31.267
Everybody, on the ground! Now!

28:34.866 --> 28:36.599
You got to be kidding me.
A bank robbery?

28:36.600 --> 28:38.500
No, they're not bank
robbers, Charles.

28:39.200 --> 28:41.100
These are Volkoff's men.

29:01.767 --> 29:03.866
Please.

29:03.933 --> 29:06.133
Nobody here wants
to be a hero.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.166
Just take the money.

29:08.233 --> 29:09.466
Take whatever you want.

29:09.467 --> 29:10.865
Just don't take our lives.

29:10.866 --> 29:12.766
Keep your pants on.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.898
You're not my type.

29:14.899 --> 29:16.532
And you're not who I am
looking for, anyway.

29:16.533 --> 29:18.232
I don't understand.
How did Volkoff's men find us?

29:18.233 --> 29:20.367
Well, somebody
must have lethem here.

29:20.433 --> 29:22.633
Don't just accuse her.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.232
No, he right.

29:24.233 --> 29:25.532
They must have followed
Charles and me.

29:25.533 --> 29:27.533
Just let him
explain, really.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.032
It'll make this
fight you're having

29:29.033 --> 29:30.265
seem like a little nothing.

29:30.266 --> 29:32.333
Just like a blip
on the radar.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.834
Is there anybody you haven't
told about our fight?

29:34.899 --> 29:36.834
Well...

29:36.899 --> 29:39.333
Oh, man, they've got
them surrounded in there.

29:39.400 --> 29:40.865
Casey, what are
we going to do?

29:40.866 --> 29:42.766
Well, if we go in
through the bank's roof,

29:42.800 --> 29:44.366
we can surprise
Volkoff's men.

29:44.367 --> 29:45.432
Sweet.

29:45.433 --> 29:47.165
Give 'em hell, sir.

29:47.166 --> 29:48.532
You coming?

29:48.533 --> 29:51.633
I- I figured you wantede to
stay in the van. You know?

29:53.066 --> 29:55.066
How you ever going
learn anything

29:55.101 --> 29:57.066
if you stay in here,
hmm? Let's g

29:57.166 --> 29:59.032
Yes, sir.

29:59.033 --> 30:00.332
I forgivyou, too, Casey.

30:00.333 --> 30:01.865
I can't believe you've
talked to everybody

30:01.866 --> 30:03.366
abouour fight
except for me.

30:03.367 --> 30:05.267
Let's go. Come on.

30:09.667 --> 30:13.166
Listen, I was just waiting until
I calmed down a little bit.

30:13.233 --> 30:15.500
Okay? It's our first
real fight as a couple,

30:15.567 --> 30:16.733
and everyone knows that
that sets the tone

30:16.734 --> 30:18.232
for all future fights.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.865
Oh, you're going to set the
precedent by telling everybody

30:19.866 --> 30:21.466
what you're thinking
and feeling before me?

30:21.467 --> 30:24.633
See, that just
makes it sound bad.

30:26.933 --> 30:30.500
* *

30:32.999 --> 30:34.899
Well, you might
as well have

30:34.966 --> 30:36.666
just posted about
our fight on Friendste

30:36.667 --> 30:37.932
Friendster? Honey,
people stopped

30:37.933 --> 30:39.299
using Friendster
five years ago.

30:39.300 --> 30:40.432
Okay, fine. You know
what I'm talking about.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.333
You know, you only just met him

30:42.367 --> 30:43.766
and he knows
everything about us.

30:43.767 --> 30:44.998
How do you know
that y can trust him?

30:44.999 --> 30:47.300
Oh. Oh. That's right.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.199
I totally forgot. You
can't believe in anyone

30:49.200 --> 30:50.366
unless Beckman tells you to.

30:50.367 --> 30:52.099
Oh, at's not fair.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.333
That's not fair? You wait a sec.

30:56.734 --> 30:58.834
No. You know what's no
fair, is what you did.

30:58.933 --> 31:00.232
You could have
at least told me

31:00.233 --> 31:01.499
before you
arrested her.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.767
Oh, what? And watch you commit
trson and go to prison?

31:03.834 --> 31:05.933
Kids, ki.
You need to stop this now.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.532
We need to do something.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.898
Yore not
doing anything.

31:08.899 --> 31:10.332
I'll stay here,
too, understand?

31:10.333 --> 31:12.233
Ye, he's just a handler. Okay.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.800
Okay, in ten seconds, we're
going to go over the counter.

31:15.866 --> 31:17.766
There are two guys.
I'm gonna take the b guy.

31:17.767 --> 31:18.865
You're gonna take
the small guy.

31:18.866 --> 31:19.965
I'm perfectly capable

31:19.966 --> 31:21.132
of handling a big
guy, too, you know

31:21.133 --> 31:25.033
Fine.
Fine.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.332
Ready.

31:31.333 --> 31:33.899
* *

31:50.233 --> 31:51.332
This is exhausting.

31:51.333 --> 31:52.833
Yeah, tell me about it.
How do you always

31:52.834 --> 31:54.734
fight the big guys
all the time?

31:57.200 --> 31:59.100
No, I mean fighting
with you is exhausting.

32:00.734 --> 32:01.965
I hate it.

32:01.966 --> 32:03.999
Me, too.

32:04.066 --> 32:05.966
I've been thinking
about you all day.

32:09.567 --> 32:11.467
Just trying protect
you from getti hurt.

32:12.467 --> 32:13.898
Behind you.

32:13.899 --> 32:16.567
I don't need you
to protect me.

32:16.633 --> 32:18.734
I need you to believe in me.

32:20.866 --> 32:22.766
I do believe in you.

32:26.233 --> 32:28.966
I mean really believe in me.

32:29.033 --> 32:31.600
Even wheyou think I'm wrong.

32:33.367 --> 32:37.033
Two field agents in action!

32:37.133 --> 32:39.033
What a show!

32:40.066 --> 32:41.966
No!

32:43.266 --> 32:45.166
Tuttle!

32:48.800 --> 32:50.700
Oh, my God.

32:59.100 --> 33:01.999
I'm so sorry, Charles.

33:03.767 --> 33:05.866
It's up to you now.

33:05.933 --> 33:07.399
No. No, no.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.099
No, no, no, Tuttle,
we're not leaving you here.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.100
Casey, we've got a man down;
where are you?

33:11.166 --> 33:12.466
I'll be okay.

33:12.467 --> 33:16.200
Get those disks...
to the computer

33:16.266 --> 33:18.533
and finish it, Charles.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.500
For Frost.

33:22.966 --> 33:24.199
Okay, listen,
Casey is on his way.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.799
You're gonna be
in safe hands, okay?

33:25.800 --> 33:27.800
But we need to go right now.
Wait, what-what are you saying?

33:27.866 --> 33:29.199
What about
your orders?

33:29.200 --> 33:30.466
I'm not nna fight you
on this anymore, Chuck.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.367
If you trust
her, then...

33:33.767 --> 33:35.667
...that's gonna
be enough for me.

33:41.834 --> 33:43.265
You're gonna be
just fine.

33:43.266 --> 33:45.233
Let's go to
Orion's space.

33:53.866 --> 33:57.233
I guess I always assumed
your father sold the house.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.800
How long has this been

33:59.866 --> 34:01.733
under here?
I- I really don't know.

34:01.734 --> 34:03.634
I only found out about it

34:03.700 --> 34:05.600
after he...

34:06.567 --> 34:08.431
It's his life's work, Mom.

34:08.433 --> 34:10.333
The computer's right here.

34:15.065 --> 34:16.399
You're welcome.

34:16.400 --> 34:20.734
Just another day in the life
of a public defender.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.666
Nobody move! Freeze!

34:22.667 --> 34:24.567
No, no! Please, I have children.

34:24.601 --> 34:25.931
Here, take...

34:25.933 --> 34:27.099
the keys to the vault.

34:27.100 --> 34:28.331
My car key's
on there, too-

34:28.333 --> 34:29.565
I drive a very
nice Cam.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.467
Shut up.
I'm a federal officer.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.699
And I'm with him.

34:34.699 --> 34:35.998
You should look
into the rf.

34:35.998 --> 34:37.899
I saw an eye-opening
piece on asbestos.

34:37.899 --> 34:39.966
Dangerous, dgerous stuff, and
you got it everywhere around here.

34:40.033 --> 34:41.431
Grimes, Grimes, muzzle it.

34:41.433 --> 34:43.333
Right. Shutting up.

35:10.100 --> 35:12.200
Looking for an injured agent.

35:12.266 --> 35:13.699
Where did he go?

35:13.700 --> 35:15.600
He's right over...

35:16.133 --> 35:18.033
...there.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.833
This doesn't...
make any sense.

35:34.834 --> 35:36.899
This has got to be some
ki of misunderstanding.

35:36.966 --> 35:39.633
The MI6 files are
suosed to be on here.

35:49.600 --> 35:51.533
This... Mom!

35:53.933 --> 35:56.300
Stay here.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.600
Sar... Sarah?

36:13.367 --> 36:14.666
Where'd you go?

36:14.667 --> 36:16.567
Chuck.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.633
Your father never
wanted you to see this.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.600
See what?

36:24.767 --> 36:27.500
What I know now
of you is wrong.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.299
Chuck?

36:48.300 --> 36:49.299
Get down.

36:49.300 --> 36:51.200
What did you...?

36:57.734 --> 36:59.634
Tuttle.

37:01.400 --> 37:03.433
How are you here right...?
You were- you- you were...

37:03.500 --> 37:05.232
You were shot.
What are you doing here?

37:05.233 --> 37:07.500
There is no Tuttle, Charles.

37:07.567 --> 37:10.800
My name is Alexei Volkoff.

37:12.999 --> 37:15.400
I believe you were
looking for me.

37:23.766 --> 37:25.565
What are...?

37:25.566 --> 37:28.367
Why are you ing this?

37:31.133 --> 37:34.067
It's really pathetic.

37:34.133 --> 37:36.800
Orion spent his whole life
searchinfor a woman

37:36.866 --> 37:39.500
who didn't want to be found.

37:39.566 --> 37:42.033
The wife he wanted
so much to believe in

37:42.100 --> 37:44.766
was exactly
what she appeared to be-

37:44.833 --> 37:46.733
a traitor.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.800
You told him about..

37:50.866 --> 37:53.434
About my husband- of course.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.400
And that he meant
nothing to her.

37:56.599 --> 37:59.733
You know, Charles...

37:59.800 --> 38:01.900
it really is shoing how Orion

38:01.966 --> 38:04.733
was able to convince you
to follow in his footsteps.

38:04.800 --> 38:07.367
What was he to you?

38:07.434 --> 38:09.334
Your mentor?

38:17.400 --> 38:19.199
He was a good man.

38:19.200 --> 38:20.533
He was a fool.

38:20.534 --> 38:23.800
Just like you, Charles.

38:23.866 --> 38:26.434
If you'd just let it alone,

38:26.500 --> 38:28.467
none of this ruse would
have been necessary.

38:28.534 --> 38:31.333
But you couldn't
let it go.

38:31.434 --> 38:33.400
I had my reasons.

38:33.467 --> 38:35.434
I'm sure you did

38:35.500 --> 38:38.367
Frost here is a
master of deception.

38:38.434 --> 38:41.167
But she wasn't able to fool
your girlfriend, was she?

38:41.233 --> 38:43.032
And you-

38:43.033 --> 38:45.067
when you locked up Frost,

38:45.133 --> 38:48.067
it became clear I had to step in
to find Orion's

38:48.100 --> 38:50.000
little base here

38:50.067 --> 38:52.133
and destroy all
his intelligence.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.633
Along with all the people

38:54.699 --> 38:57.833
who know about it,
of course.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.133
Thank you for leading
us here, Charles.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.966
I couldn't have ne
it without you.

39:16.866 --> 39:18.565
I believed in you.

39:18.566 --> 39:20.366
Don't take it personally.

39:20.367 --> 39:24.367
There's no point in going to the
grave with regrets, is there?

39:26.534 --> 39:27.698
Frost...

39:27.699 --> 39:29.733
Ready.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.200
Protect him.

39:38.233 --> 39:41.333
* *

39:41.400 --> 39:44.000
Shall we finish this?

39:47.500 --> 39:48.932
Apologies.

39:48.933 --> 39:51.966
It really was a easure
getting to know you.

39:55.633 --> 39:58.133
You were right about
her the whole time.

40:00.599 --> 40:01.865
I couldn't see it.
I didn't-

40:01.866 --> 40:03.900
I didn't want to see it.

40:05.966 --> 40:07.966
Flash! Come on!

40:08.033 --> 40:10.599
Flash!

40:10.666 --> 40:14.966
Sarah, my mom did something
to me with that device.

40:15.033 --> 40:17.133
Look, your mom gave
us a way out.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.765
She might be working
for Volkoff,

40:18.766 --> 40:21.900
but she certainly has a reason
for not wanting us to die

40:21.966 --> 40:22.999
right now.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.099
Hurry, let's go.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.598
Wait, what about
my father's work?

40:25.599 --> 40:27.500
No, we don't have time.
Let's go.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.499
* *

40:48.833 --> 40:50.800
Chuck...

40:50.866 --> 40:54.300
Chuck, are you okay?

40:59.067 --> 41:01.933
All of my father's resrch-

41:02.000 --> 41:03.900
everything he ever created-

41:05.000 --> 41:07.167
it's all gone.

41:09.866 --> 41:12.233
* *

41:12.300 --> 41:15.866
He said it would be
outside waiting for us.

41:15.933 --> 41:18.666
It really is my dad's car.

41:18.733 --> 41:20.666
I can't lieve it's been
here this whole time.

41:20.733 --> 41:22.633
Babe, it's beautiful.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.866
"Eleanor,
if you're reading this,

41:33.933 --> 41:36.067
"tn it means I'm not
with you anymore.

41:36.133 --> 41:38.133
"And I know you'll be okay.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.866
"I only wish I could have been
the father you deserved,

41:41.933 --> 41:44.167
"but our family had
a t of secrets-

41:44.233 --> 41:48.100
"secrets I kept from you
because you were so young,

41:48.167 --> 41:50.566
"because I didn't want
to ht you.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.966
"I know you're
a grown woman now,

41:53.033 --> 41:56.467
"but no matter what, you'll
always be my little girl

41:56.500 --> 41:58.699
curled up on the middle seat
of this car."

42:04.067 --> 42:07.267
"This is my final gift
to you, Eleanor,

42:07.333 --> 42:10.500
"and I'm giving it to you
now for a reas.

42:10.566 --> 42:12.399
"I trust that you'll know
what to do.

42:12.400 --> 42:14.166
I love you, always- Dad."
