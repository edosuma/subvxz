WEBVTT

00:01.229 --> 00:03.254
<i>Hush, island baby</i>

00:03.365 --> 00:05.595
<i>Tomorrow you'll shuck the cane</i>

00:05.801 --> 00:08.167
<i>Your little fingers bloody</i>

00:08.603 --> 00:11.936
<i>Prepare to be whipped</i>

00:12.107 --> 00:13.665
She's asleep.

00:18.113 --> 00:19.637
<i>Hey! It's Mommy!</i>

00:19.748 --> 00:21.010
<i>I'm in Beijing!</i>

00:21.116 --> 00:22.777
Shh!
Liddy just went to sleep.

00:22.951 --> 00:24.213
Well, wake her up, Jack!

00:24.319 --> 00:25.752
She needs to hear
her mommy's voice.

00:25.921 --> 00:28.890
No, when she's ready, Dr. Kevorkian
says we have to put her down.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.652
He's a very good pediatrician,
but that is an unfortunate name.

00:31.827 --> 00:33.192
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
<i>She'll fall back asleep.</i>

00:33.361 --> 00:36.125
No. Call back tomorrow.
She has Babynomics at 11:00.

00:36.231 --> 00:38.199
<i>Liddy!</i>
<i>It's your mother!</i>

00:38.900 --> 00:40.891
<i>Lmprinting!</i>
<i>Lmprinti...</i>

00:43.972 --> 00:46.634
God, Tracy could have
cleaned up before he left.

00:47.008 --> 00:49.408
And why did he leave
all this soda here?

00:49.744 --> 00:51.143
What are you doing?
That's his urine.

00:51.279 --> 00:52.644
He is not well.

00:53.648 --> 00:56.173
Someday this place
is gonna be a kick-ass duplex,

00:56.318 --> 00:57.376
like on "Diff'rent Strokes."

00:57.686 --> 00:59.677
Conrad Bain once slapped me
in a men's room.

01:00.021 --> 01:01.283
I just got to get rid
of all these boxes.

01:01.423 --> 01:03.653
I don't even know
what this stuff is anymore.

01:04.659 --> 01:09.221
<i>Comenc√© a estudiar</i> these,
but then <i>yo</i> gave up.

01:10.832 --> 01:12.663
Here's the novel I never finished.

01:12.834 --> 01:13.858
Hmm.

01:14.302 --> 01:16.964
"Liz stabbed Jenna repeatedly."

01:18.406 --> 01:19.373
<i>The Secret?</i>

01:19.674 --> 01:22.040
I gave you this five years ago.
You still haven't read it?

01:23.011 --> 01:25.172
It works, Liz.
Look at me.

01:25.280 --> 01:27.009
Ever since I started secreting,

01:27.115 --> 01:29.811
I've become a TV star,
I found my soul mate.

01:29.985 --> 01:32.453
You saw how flat Gwyneth Paltrow
sang at the Oscars.

01:32.754 --> 01:34.381
I visualized all of that.

01:34.689 --> 01:37.715
Jenna, the only way to make
things happen in the real world

01:37.826 --> 01:39.020
is by taking action.

01:39.194 --> 01:40.218
Well, I've taken Action.

01:40.328 --> 01:42.956
It dries your mouth out,
but the sex is amazing.

01:43.131 --> 01:45.099
No, I'm talking
about taking control,

01:49.204 --> 01:51.934
I always think of a third thing
when I'm listing stuff.

01:52.140 --> 01:53.368
If taking control is so great,

01:53.475 --> 01:55.443
then how do you explain
your personal life?

01:55.744 --> 01:58.008
I mean, look at the Post-it
on your sweater.

02:00.715 --> 02:03.707
Oh, boy.
You're right.

02:03.852 --> 02:07.788
I just have to care about myself
as much as I care about work,

02:07.923 --> 02:08.889
starting right now.

02:09.056 --> 02:11.719
I'm gonna clean this apartment
while I learn Spanish.

02:11.826 --> 02:14.090
Last year, I used <i>The Secret</i>
to learn Spanish,

02:14.196 --> 02:15.720
and now I'm fluent.

02:15.830 --> 02:18.958
Rosa, I know
you stole my necklace.

02:19.167 --> 02:21.931
I'll have your son deported.

02:22.037 --> 02:24.972
Oh, wait.
I found my necklace.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.368
Oh, boy.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.260 --> 02:46.192
Great news, Jack.

02:46.361 --> 02:49.159
I've got a new life philosophy
that I call "Lizbeanism."

02:49.264 --> 02:51.289
I see. And how did you
come up with that name?

02:51.433 --> 02:55.392
Well, I'm Liz, and obviously,
my philosophy is simple, like a bean.

02:55.537 --> 02:57.164
I'm fixing problems
in my personal life

02:57.272 --> 02:58.933
the same way
I fix problems at work.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.904
I saved the show.
Now I'm gonna save me.

03:02.110 --> 03:05.978
Because Lizbeanism means
that I am a dike...

03:06.081 --> 03:08.174
against the rising waters
of mediocrity.

03:08.383 --> 03:10.283
- Good for you, Lemon.
- Check this out, Jack.

03:10.385 --> 03:12.979
Tile samples.
First, I redo the bathroom.

03:13.188 --> 03:15.315
Then I redo the whole apartment,
and then, the world.

03:16.524 --> 03:19.254
I'm impressed, Lemon.
You're talking like a winner.

03:19.461 --> 03:21.793
I'm going to give you...

03:24.432 --> 03:25.990
...one of my neckties.

03:30.038 --> 03:31.164
This is a big moment for me.

03:31.273 --> 03:33.036
You're taking control
of your destiny.

03:33.241 --> 03:34.435
No matter how strait the gate

03:34.542 --> 03:36.476
or charged with punishments
the scroll,

03:36.878 --> 03:38.812
I am the master of my fate,

03:38.980 --> 03:41.471
I am the captain of my soul.

03:41.850 --> 03:42.874
That's from "Invictus."

03:42.984 --> 03:44.508
Wait, who was the white guy in that?

03:44.886 --> 03:49.152
Maybe someday you'll be like me,
running a billion-dollar corporation,

03:49.257 --> 03:52.351
having people pay you for
the privilege of cutting your hair.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.553
- Raising a child.
- You're raising a child?

03:54.863 --> 03:56.922
Come on. I think Avery
is probably doing that.

03:57.098 --> 03:59.532
Not really. Avery has been traveling
a lot as part of "NBC News"'

03:59.834 --> 04:02.029
"Hot Blondes in Weird Places"
initiative,

04:02.237 --> 04:03.829
so she's been out of the baby loop.

04:04.005 --> 04:05.438
Until Liddy is sleep-trained,

04:05.540 --> 04:08.873
frankly, it might be easier
if Avery stays in Asia.

04:09.010 --> 04:09.840
Be careful what you wish for.

04:09.944 --> 04:12.105
According to <i>The Secret,</i>
it'll come true.

04:12.314 --> 04:14.908
I wish Liz Lemon would leave
so I could go back to work.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.618
Oh! Ugh!
What's pulling me?

04:18.019 --> 04:20.043
I want to stay here
and keep boring Jack!

04:21.221 --> 04:24.123
Oh! Okay! I really fell!
I need help!

04:25.393 --> 04:26.985
Tracy, welcome back.

04:27.195 --> 04:29.595
I think I speak for all of us
when I say how thrilled we...

04:29.931 --> 04:32.991
Great impression
of a guy that sucks, Dotcom!

04:33.101 --> 04:35.433
Look, we've got
a lot of work to catch up on.

04:35.603 --> 04:37.195
Yes, sir!
It just feels so good

04:37.405 --> 04:40.568
to have the Three Musketeers
and Dotcom back together again.

04:41.509 --> 04:42.942
Smooth move, Ferguson.

04:45.647 --> 04:47.046
What are you laughing about?

04:47.282 --> 04:48.180
Oh, nothing, sir.

04:48.283 --> 04:50.308
Just an inside joke
from when you were gone.

04:50.418 --> 04:51.885
You kind of needed to be there.

04:52.087 --> 04:53.111
No, no, no, no. No.

04:53.321 --> 04:56.950
You three are not allowed to have
inside jokes that I'm not a part of.

04:57.058 --> 04:59.891
I could have inside jokes
that you're not a part of,

05:00.128 --> 05:02.187
for example, "Hot feet"

05:02.297 --> 05:04.356
or "Ask Melissa about it."

05:06.000 --> 05:07.399
But my entourage serves me,

05:07.502 --> 05:10.528
and "Smooth move, Ferguson"
is not funny to me,

05:10.638 --> 05:13.573
so it is forbidden, understand?

05:13.942 --> 05:15.102
Next order of business,

05:15.210 --> 05:17.906
Grizz's DVD reviews
for this weekend.

05:19.647 --> 05:21.615
You wouldn't expect
a movie called "Somewhere"

05:21.916 --> 05:24.009
to go absolutely nowhere.

05:24.352 --> 05:27.219
<i>Sometimes we use a song</i>
<i>to move a story along</i>

05:27.322 --> 05:30.155
<i>And explain it to you</i>

05:31.326 --> 05:33.123
<i>'Cause Liz is taking charge</i>

05:33.228 --> 05:37.096
<i>She's in control</i>
<i>of everything she do</i>

05:37.198 --> 05:40.326
<i>In her personal life</i>

05:40.435 --> 05:41.629
<i>Hey, hey, na, na</i>

05:41.936 --> 05:43.460
<i>In her personal life</i>

05:43.671 --> 05:46.469
<i>But here comes</i>
<i>a story obstacle now</i>

05:46.574 --> 05:48.235
What's that?

05:50.712 --> 05:52.509
Tony, there's a bag in that tree,

05:52.714 --> 05:54.614
and it's right outside the window

05:54.716 --> 05:56.946
of my soon-to-be-perfect-life
apartment.

05:57.185 --> 05:58.618
If you're not in the building,
I don't have to talk to you.

05:59.721 --> 06:02.554
Trees are city property.
You have to take it up with City Hall.

06:04.526 --> 06:07.017
That's your mother, Liddy.
Say hello.

06:08.096 --> 06:10.291
<i>Who's ready for Skype sex?</i>

06:10.398 --> 06:13.390
- No, no, no. This is the Liddy call.
- <i>What? I can't see.</i>

06:14.202 --> 06:16.033
You people
have too much money.

06:16.137 --> 06:17.695
<i>Hi, Sherry!</i>

06:19.007 --> 06:21.066
<i>I don't know why our daughter</i>
<i>would be afraid of Reagan.</i>

06:21.309 --> 06:23.539
Are you accusing me of not doing
enough Reagan time with her?

06:23.978 --> 06:25.536
<i>No. Of course not.</i>

06:25.647 --> 06:28.639
<i>Listen, News wants me</i>
<i>to extend the trip.</i>

06:29.217 --> 06:31.981
<i>But I can get out of it</i>
<i>if you need me there to help.</i>

06:35.390 --> 06:37.358
No.

06:37.459 --> 06:39.086
- You stay.
- <i>Are you sure?</i>

06:40.128 --> 06:42.722
I'm sure. Bring back
some throwing stars for Liddy.

06:43.064 --> 06:44.053
<i>I will.</i>

06:44.165 --> 06:47.066
<i>And thank you for being</i>
<i>the best husband ever.</i>

06:49.604 --> 06:54.132
<i>So, do you want to watch me</i>
<i>eat jelly beans... real slow?</i>

06:54.442 --> 06:55.568
Yes.

06:59.514 --> 07:02.142
Smooth move, Ferguson!

07:02.250 --> 07:04.343
I knew it! I knew you
were saying that behind my back.

07:04.586 --> 07:06.019
How long were you in there?

07:06.187 --> 07:07.381
I knew you wouldn't stop.

07:07.622 --> 07:10.318
And now your failure leaves us
with only one option.

07:10.492 --> 07:14.121
Explain to me why
"Smooth move, Ferguson" is funny.

07:14.662 --> 07:18.564
Well, while you were away,
we ordered Mexican food,

07:18.666 --> 07:21.032
and the delivery guy tripped,

07:21.135 --> 07:26.334
and then Mr. Griswald said,
"Smooth move, Ferguson."

07:27.041 --> 07:28.770
That story is not funny.

07:29.377 --> 07:32.312
- Sir, you had to be there.
- Then I will be.

07:32.413 --> 07:33.710
We are going to re-create

07:33.815 --> 07:36.477
all the events surrounding
"Smooth move, Ferguson"

07:36.718 --> 07:38.481
exactly as they occurred.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.585
Maybe then we can
get on with our lives.

07:40.822 --> 07:42.813
Let's get to work!

07:48.596 --> 07:50.689
Jonathan, what is going on?

07:51.099 --> 07:52.464
Sir, you need to see this,

07:52.667 --> 07:54.601
even if it ruins whatever
you had planned for Secretary's Day,

07:54.702 --> 07:56.533
like a poem you wrote for me
or whatever.

07:58.540 --> 08:00.132
<i>We go now</i>
<i>to a pre-taped statement</i>

08:00.241 --> 08:03.369
<i>from super-crazy Korean dictator,</i>
<i>Kim Jong-il.</i>

08:06.080 --> 08:09.641
<i>People of North Korea,</i>
<i>it is your dear leader, Kim Jong-il,</i>

08:09.751 --> 08:11.844
<i>world's greatest golfer</i>
<i>and movie director</i>

08:12.153 --> 08:15.418
<i>and best man</i>
<i>at Tom Brady's wedding.</i>

08:17.725 --> 08:22.162
<i>As we all know, the decadent Western</i>
<i>journalist spy Laura Ling left us</i>

08:22.263 --> 08:24.754
<i>because she can't party</i>
<i>as hard as we can.</i>

08:26.668 --> 08:28.727
- <i>I know, right?</i>
- <i>I know, right?</i>

08:28.836 --> 08:32.465
<i>But now another American reporter</i>
<i>has come to North Korea</i>

08:32.573 --> 08:35.543
<i>because it's awesome</i>
<i>and we have enough food.</i>

08:39.414 --> 08:43.441
<i>Her name is Avery Jessup,</i>
<i>and, like me, her hair is blond!</i>

08:45.820 --> 08:48.550
<i>One of our own,</i>
<i>NB C's Avery Jessup-Donaghy,</i>

08:48.656 --> 08:49.884
<i>detained in North Korea.</i>

08:50.258 --> 08:51.816
<i>More on that as it develops.</i>

08:52.160 --> 08:53.354
<i>But first, it's never too early</i>

08:53.461 --> 08:55.520
<i>to plan your dog's</i>
<i>Halloween costume.</i>

08:55.763 --> 08:57.822
I told her to stay.
I didn't want her at home.

08:58.132 --> 08:59.224
This is my fault.

08:59.334 --> 09:03.327
Sir, if you say one more syllable,
that's a haiku.

09:03.838 --> 09:05.669
Leave.

09:08.843 --> 09:11.744
I'm not afraid of you, City Hall.

09:11.846 --> 09:13.575
Let's do this.

09:23.424 --> 09:26.188
Don't go in there!
Run, citizen!

09:33.434 --> 09:36.301
Look, Boehner, we're all upset.
I mean, it's my wife.

09:36.771 --> 09:37.897
John, stop crying.

09:38.206 --> 09:40.197
I can't understand you.

09:40.408 --> 09:41.739
- I said he's busy.
- Is he, Jonathan?

09:41.843 --> 09:43.208
I got a bag stuck in a tree.

09:43.311 --> 09:45.211
Jack, I have a bag stuck in a tree
outside my apartment,

09:45.313 --> 09:45.870
and I can't get it down,

09:46.180 --> 09:48.375
and I don't know why
it's making me so crazy...

09:48.616 --> 09:50.345
Yes, you do.
You said it yourself.

09:50.551 --> 09:52.348
It's not just about a bag or a view.

09:52.453 --> 09:54.887
It's about taking charge of your life
and solving problems.

09:55.256 --> 09:57.383
I'm facing a similar situation myself.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.853
Lay it on me.
Two-way street.

09:59.193 --> 10:01.218
Avery has been kidnapped
by Kim Jong-il.

10:01.429 --> 10:02.828
What? Why?
Is she a spy?

10:02.930 --> 10:04.659
Oh, my God,
I already know too much!

10:04.766 --> 10:07.428
Kim Jong-il runs
a vast propaganda machine.

10:07.602 --> 10:09.399
Evidently, his latest insane idea

10:09.504 --> 10:10.869
is to bring in a Western journalist

10:10.972 --> 10:12.530
to report on how the free world

10:12.640 --> 10:14.699
is being conquered
by North Korea.

10:15.476 --> 10:16.966
And in food news,

10:17.278 --> 10:19.746
you've had enough to eat today.

10:19.847 --> 10:22.577
Now here with the weather
is Johnny Mountain.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.480
North Korea,
everything sunny all the time always!

10:25.586 --> 10:27.281
Good time beach party!

10:27.388 --> 10:28.821
Back to you, Alereeb!

10:30.958 --> 10:31.982
You have got to call
President Clinton.

10:32.293 --> 10:33.988
He got Lisa Ling's sister
out of North Korea.

10:34.429 --> 10:35.953
President InterBush
is out of the question.

10:36.264 --> 10:37.595
Avery will never accept his help.

10:37.865 --> 10:39.457
She can't forgive him
for not hitting on her

10:39.567 --> 10:41.296
during
the 1996 Democratic Convention.

10:41.536 --> 10:42.833
- She's much too thin.
- I do, of course,

10:43.237 --> 10:46.900
still have some connections,
but my best bet is fraught.

10:47.275 --> 10:49.505
I never should have broken up
with Condi via text message.

10:49.711 --> 10:51.804
You broke up
with Condoleezza Rice by text?

10:51.979 --> 10:53.879
"Me plus you equals frowny face."

10:54.716 --> 10:56.445
- Yeah, you can't call her.
- I know.

10:56.651 --> 10:59.677
But I am going to solve this,
just like you are going to solve

10:59.787 --> 11:03.450
your equally important
bag-in-a-tree situation.

11:04.425 --> 11:05.892
"Invictus," Lemon.

11:07.729 --> 11:09.720
Now that I've killed that bug,
I'd like to call

11:09.831 --> 11:13.358
this "Smooth Move, Ferguson"
re-creation meeting to order.

11:13.468 --> 11:14.492
Kenneth, report.

11:14.702 --> 11:17.398
Well, sir, we've got
the delivery guy booked,

11:17.505 --> 11:19.370
but I've run into some big problems.

11:19.574 --> 11:21.599
For example,
it was raining that day.

11:21.843 --> 11:24.744
Get a rain machine!
Look, here, take my credit card.

11:25.546 --> 11:28.982
Use it to break into a special-effects
warehouse to steal one.

11:29.383 --> 11:30.941
Well, sir,
even if we did that,

11:31.052 --> 11:32.610
there are some things
we can't control.

11:32.820 --> 11:35.015
We don't remember
what we were wearing.

11:35.323 --> 11:37.484
- Dotcom was sick...
- Security footage.

11:37.592 --> 11:39.617
Dotcom licks
the subway steps.

11:39.827 --> 11:41.852
These are solvable problems.

11:42.063 --> 11:43.428
Well, what about this?

11:43.531 --> 11:46.659
Miss Maroney was here,
screaming at Mr. Rossitano.

11:46.868 --> 11:49.063
Later that day,
she got her hair cut.

11:49.470 --> 11:51.631
Aw, thank you.

11:51.739 --> 11:54.367
The point is,
her hair was longer then.

11:54.609 --> 11:57.009
J-Mo, how long would it take
for your hair to grow back?

11:57.378 --> 11:58.902
It depends. Do you have access
to horse semen?

11:59.313 --> 12:00.940
- You know I do.
- Give me three weeks.

12:01.315 --> 12:03.715
Then, we'll reconvene in three weeks!
Meeting is adjourned!

12:03.951 --> 12:06.317
Oh, my God!
What happened to my bug?

12:10.391 --> 12:12.552
Stupid grappling hook!
Can't catch one little bag?

12:21.002 --> 12:22.435
You think I'm giving up?

12:22.537 --> 12:24.835
Did I give up when that squirrel
I trained to retrieve you

12:24.939 --> 12:25.928
just ran away?

12:26.040 --> 12:27.905
You will not win, Mr. Bag!

12:28.109 --> 12:29.736
But, Liz, I already have.

12:30.044 --> 12:31.978
- What did you say?
- Jack's wrong.

12:32.079 --> 12:34.877
No human is truly
the master of his fate.

12:34.982 --> 12:39.419
Even your dream apartment
can't protect you from death.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.420
I'm not ruining your view.

12:41.522 --> 12:43.786
I'm reminding you
of your mortality,

12:43.891 --> 12:47.054
'cause you know I'll be here
long after you're gone,

12:47.361 --> 12:49.795
the wind rustling
against my genitals.

12:49.897 --> 12:51.888
That's right,
bags have genitals.

12:52.099 --> 12:54.863
- You don't know me.
- Go ahead, buy nesting tables.

12:55.102 --> 12:56.797
Paint an accent wall.

12:57.004 --> 12:59.837
I'll watch the EMTs
take you out in my cousin,

12:59.941 --> 13:01.135
a body bag.

13:07.782 --> 13:10.580
K-9, Operation Ferguson
status report!

13:10.751 --> 13:12.719
Rain, check.

13:12.887 --> 13:14.582
Room temperature, check.

13:14.755 --> 13:16.689
Ms. Maroney's hair length,
check.

13:16.891 --> 13:18.119
Do you like it?

13:18.426 --> 13:19.984
If you say no, I'll drown myself.

13:20.394 --> 13:24.091
Mr. Griswald, could you put the TV
on the right channel, MSNBC?

13:24.832 --> 13:27.892
- Was Dotcom standing that gay?
- No, sir, he was not.

13:29.036 --> 13:30.731
<i>...today denying reports</i>
<i>that Jessup-Donaghy</i>

13:30.838 --> 13:32.931
<i>is anchoring a fake</i>
<i>Western news channel,</i>

13:33.040 --> 13:36.476
<i>calling the accusations</i>
<i>"as ridiculous as the dunk</i>

13:36.577 --> 13:39.410
<i>Kim Jong-il won</i>
<i>the NBA dunk contest with."</i>

13:39.614 --> 13:41.639
Hey, what's my boy KJ
doing on TV?

13:41.883 --> 13:43.680
What?
That's Kim Jong-il.

13:43.918 --> 13:46.944
Yeah. We did a movie together
that he directed and co-starred in.

13:52.660 --> 13:53.786
Death to the CIA!

13:53.961 --> 13:57.624
Let us all increase production
of millet and sunflowers!

13:58.532 --> 14:01.433
I defuse bomb, black partner.
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

14:03.971 --> 14:07.168
Dude, I think you did
a North Korean propaganda film.

14:07.575 --> 14:09.099
It was either that
or play a rapping doorman

14:09.210 --> 14:10.575
in a Kate Hudson movie.

14:10.778 --> 14:11.745
Oh, okay.

14:12.747 --> 14:14.681
He's coming.
Places, everyone.

14:22.523 --> 14:23.956
Smooth move, Ferguson.

14:32.466 --> 14:34.900
I get it now!
It's so funny!

14:35.169 --> 14:37.069
Everyone, laugh!

14:37.705 --> 14:39.639
Now, you sons of bitches!

14:49.116 --> 14:52.916
Tracy, it's come to my attention
that you know Kim Jong-il,

14:53.020 --> 14:54.783
and obviously,
I'm concerned about my wife,

14:54.889 --> 14:56.880
and I want to know
what she's going through.

14:56.991 --> 14:59.084
Please, hold nothing back.

14:59.493 --> 15:00.152
Okay.

15:00.261 --> 15:02.491
But you might not like
what I have to tell you.

15:03.264 --> 15:04.561
Kim Jong-il

15:04.665 --> 15:06.929
sometimes shoots
in the closeup too much.

15:07.134 --> 15:08.829
Comedy lives in the wide shot.

15:09.070 --> 15:12.597
And also...
this is gonna be rough...

15:12.707 --> 15:15.198
his acting notes are often vague.

15:15.609 --> 15:18.077
Okay. Thank you.

15:19.613 --> 15:21.604
What is this?
Oh, my God!

15:22.249 --> 15:23.580
They're letting her speak!

15:23.684 --> 15:24.912
<i>For the past three weeks,</i>

15:25.019 --> 15:29.854
<i>I have been honored to partake</i>
<i>in a political re-education regimen.</i>

15:29.957 --> 15:32.619
<i>I have voluntarily taken</i>
<i>several floggings</i>

15:32.727 --> 15:34.627
<i>for being an arrogant American...</i>

15:34.862 --> 15:36.056
That's okay.
She's tough.

15:36.297 --> 15:39.824
We do a lot of pirate-themed
sexual role-play.

15:39.934 --> 15:41.026
I'm a parrot.

15:41.135 --> 15:44.627
<i>Also, I spend eight hours a day</i>
<i>breaking concrete blocks</i>

15:44.739 --> 15:46.730
<i>to learn to be</i>
<i>an obedient worker...</i>

15:46.974 --> 15:49.841
No problem. She pays $1,000 an hour
to do that with her trainer.

15:50.044 --> 15:53.013
<i>...and I have concluded</i>
<i>that capitalism may be flawed.</i>

15:54.715 --> 15:56.012
My God!

15:56.117 --> 15:58.915
What are those monsters
doing to her?

16:01.856 --> 16:03.016
Dr. Rice?

16:03.124 --> 16:05.615
Well, look
what the cat dragged in.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.088
Hello, Condi.
You're looking well.

16:07.661 --> 16:08.992
You know, I've been to the DMZ.

16:09.096 --> 16:11.564
They have signs.
Can your wife not read?

16:11.766 --> 16:13.290
Okay.
We're all adults here...

16:13.601 --> 16:15.899
So, what is it?
Is she funnier than I am?

16:16.103 --> 16:18.571
She's certainly
not younger, is she?

16:18.806 --> 16:20.569
Condi, we are not doing this.

16:20.775 --> 16:22.140
Oh, we are doing this.

16:22.309 --> 16:24.743
I'm sorry that I
broke up with you by text.

16:24.979 --> 16:29.143
I'm sorry I went drinking
with Karl Rove on Valentine's Day.

16:29.617 --> 16:31.812
I'm sorry that I said
your favorite movie was lame.

16:32.053 --> 16:33.884
"Mars Attacks!" is awesome!

16:34.355 --> 16:37.586
Now, admit that I'm better at
the piano than you are at the flute.

16:37.825 --> 16:39.122
Never!

16:56.077 --> 16:57.977
Follow this, you turkey!

17:09.223 --> 17:10.190
All right, damn it!

17:12.126 --> 17:14.390
- You are better.
- I'll see what I can do, Jack.

17:14.762 --> 17:16.695
Now, get out of here
before this gets weird.

17:20.101 --> 17:21.796
You're the turkey.

17:24.672 --> 17:28.199
You know what, Mr. Bag?
I will have a nice day!

17:28.642 --> 17:32.305
I'm gonna hang you in my kitchen
and fill you with other bags!

17:32.413 --> 17:34.745
- You will eat your family!
- Hey!

17:34.982 --> 17:36.415
That's city property!
Put the saw down!

17:36.817 --> 17:38.341
- No, no, I almost got him!
- Right now!

17:38.752 --> 17:39.980
Look, don't think
I won't taser you, all right?

17:40.087 --> 17:42.078
I got OCD,
and I love doing paperwork.

17:50.831 --> 17:52.059
It's worth it!

17:57.304 --> 17:58.362
- Avery?
- Jack!

17:58.672 --> 17:59.366
Oh, thank God!

17:59.673 --> 18:00.867
I forgot the U.S. Country code,

18:00.975 --> 18:02.670
but then I remembered,
it's number one!

18:02.843 --> 18:05.334
- How are you calling me?
- Nobody here's ever seen an iPhone.

18:05.446 --> 18:06.845
I told them it was my razor.

18:06.947 --> 18:08.812
I have to shave my legs with it,
but they have an app for that.

18:09.049 --> 18:11.347
Oh, Avery, I'm sorry.
This is all my fault.

18:11.452 --> 18:12.942
- I told you to stay.
- <i>No.</i>

18:13.187 --> 18:14.449
This is nobody's fault.

18:14.755 --> 18:16.188
Except maybe
that pansy Harry Truman

18:16.357 --> 18:18.018
<i>for not taking down this country</i>
<i>when he had the chance.</i>

18:18.125 --> 18:20.252
- Truman!
- Look, my battery's dying,

18:20.361 --> 18:21.726
and the outlets here
are shaped weird,

18:21.829 --> 18:23.694
and I don't think they have
any electricity in them anyway,

18:23.931 --> 18:25.455
<i>so I don't want you</i>
<i>to worry about me.</i>

18:25.866 --> 18:26.855
They actually love me here.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.366
I already won
a North Korean Emmy.

18:28.469 --> 18:31.700
- So if I don't ever make it home...
- Avery, don't say that.

18:31.906 --> 18:34.033
I spoke... to Condoleezza.

18:34.241 --> 18:35.230
Really?

18:35.342 --> 18:37.071
Did you also call Sally Ride
and her sister?

18:37.311 --> 18:40.280
Come on, Avery. Not now.
I am going to get you out of there.

18:40.381 --> 18:42.110
You are married
to Jack Donaghy, damn it,

18:42.216 --> 18:43.444
and the world
doesn't get to do this to us.

18:43.851 --> 18:46.342
We control our fates!
We are in charge!

18:46.453 --> 18:49.320
Avery?
Are you still there?

18:52.126 --> 18:53.957
I'm sure her battery died

18:54.061 --> 18:56.222
right after I finished that speech,
just like I wanted it to.

18:56.430 --> 18:57.988
Smooth move, Ferguson!

18:58.899 --> 18:59.991
Smooth move, Ferguson!

19:00.100 --> 19:02.193
Mr. Jordan,
please, let it go.

19:02.303 --> 19:03.497
It's just a joke.

19:03.804 --> 19:05.101
It's not about the joke.

19:05.206 --> 19:07.800
It's about what the joke
represents, you monsters!

19:08.008 --> 19:09.100
What do you mean, sir?

19:09.343 --> 19:11.208
I came back,
and you were fine without me.

19:11.312 --> 19:13.041
You laughed without me!

19:13.280 --> 19:14.872
And that was our special thing.

19:15.082 --> 19:15.912
But no,

19:16.016 --> 19:19.474
you thought "Smooth move, Ferguson"
was so hilarious.

19:19.887 --> 19:22.412
It wasn't!
It wasn't funny!

19:22.523 --> 19:24.013
There, are you happy?

19:24.258 --> 19:26.158
You dropped a bomb, K!
Continue!

19:26.393 --> 19:28.418
We were miserable without you, sir.

19:28.829 --> 19:32.094
"Smooth move, Ferguson"
was just trying to fill a void

19:32.199 --> 19:35.191
because Mr. Slattery's
political cartoons weren't cutting it.

19:35.402 --> 19:36.835
I can't draw hands.

19:37.071 --> 19:39.062
You're the one
who makes us laugh.

19:39.340 --> 19:41.001
Never go away again.

19:43.110 --> 19:45.101
Don't ever tell me what to do!

19:46.280 --> 19:48.111
Quad hug, me in the middle!

19:49.783 --> 19:52.308
Also, due to a paperwork mix-up,

19:52.419 --> 19:56.185
you will not
be getting paid this month!

19:56.490 --> 19:59.015
I did it, Jack!
I got the bag!

19:59.260 --> 20:00.022
<i>You were right.</i>

20:00.127 --> 20:02.186
No matter how much
the gate is strait

20:02.296 --> 20:04.230
or who punishes the scrolls,

20:04.331 --> 20:07.061
I am the captain of my holes.

20:07.167 --> 20:08.259
Or whatever.

20:08.369 --> 20:10.098
We are in control!

20:10.337 --> 20:12.066
No, we aren't.
I was wrong.

20:12.573 --> 20:16.509
Condi tried,
but Avery plus freedom equals...

20:16.810 --> 20:18.038
frowny face.

20:19.213 --> 20:21.306
<i>I'm sorry, what's happening?</i>

20:23.284 --> 20:24.979
They're never going to let her go.

20:25.085 --> 20:28.384
Avery is now married
to Kim Jong-il's son,

20:28.489 --> 20:30.457
- Kim Jong-un.
- What?

20:37.898 --> 20:39.422
No!

20:39.533 --> 20:41.933
Mortality!

20:42.102 --> 20:43.831
Smooth move, Ferguson.

20:45.839 --> 20:48.467
Put that coffee down.

20:48.842 --> 20:50.275
Coffee's for closers only.

20:50.444 --> 20:52.309
I'm here from Park and Kim.

20:52.513 --> 20:55.038
I'm here on a mission of mercy.

20:55.149 --> 20:56.946
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

20:57.151 --> 20:58.413
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

20:58.619 --> 21:00.086
I don't have to listen to this.

21:00.287 --> 21:01.345
No, you don't, pal,

21:01.588 --> 21:03.351
'cause the good news is,
you're fired.

21:03.924 --> 21:06.154
Oh, have I got your attention now?

21:06.260 --> 21:07.591
The leads are weak.

21:07.961 --> 21:09.952
The leads are weak?
You're weak!

21:10.064 --> 21:11.395
Luke, I am your father.

21:11.498 --> 21:12.487
Ghostbusters.

21:12.966 --> 21:14.558
Let's go, black partner!
