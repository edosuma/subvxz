- Get into it.

10:41.048 --> 10:42.881
...he was trying really hard

10:42.883 --> 10:45.985
for that shit, like making
all that crazy noises.

10:45.987 --> 10:49.587
- You know, like...
- Oh, my God. I don't sound like that.

10:49.589 --> 10:52.925
I know how you sound. And I was,
"What the fuck, a bear!

10:52.927 --> 10:54.727
- A bear!"
- A crazy beast, yeah.

10:54.729 --> 10:56.128
You know, it was like
a bear and then he...

10:56.130 --> 10:57.297
You know the go...

10:57.299 --> 10:59.698
- How you say that, goat?
- Yeah.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.168
They... the shit goes...
It's like plop, plop, plop.

11:02.170 --> 11:04.203
Was it... but it was big?

11:04.205 --> 11:05.838
He's like...

11:05.840 --> 11:07.974
Maybe it was like
the final thing, right?

11:07.976 --> 11:09.842
He didn't think
anybody was watching.

11:09.844 --> 11:13.212
- No.
- All right, yeah, OK.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.081
That's pretty much
the whole story.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.716
Basically, I just
took a shit next to where

11:16.718 --> 11:19.019
she was tasking a piss.
And then, yeah.

11:19.021 --> 11:22.122
But so that kind of cleared up
most of the confusion.

11:22.124 --> 11:25.191
- And then... uh...
- And that's it.

11:25.193 --> 11:27.860
- Yeah, that's mostly it.
- That's our story.

11:27.862 --> 11:30.763
Then I said sorry
for being so weird.

11:30.765 --> 11:33.300
And then she read my palms.

11:33.302 --> 11:37.938
- Ah. That's fucking great.
- Yeah.

11:37.940 --> 11:40.573

- Who?
- You are.

11:49.318 --> 11:51.251
You can't just say I'm blushing
to embarrass me.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.952
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

11:52.954 --> 11:56.790
- Why are you blushing?
- You guys are in love.

11:56.792 --> 11:59.126
No, we're not a couple.

11:59.128 --> 12:01.862

13:13.703 --> 13:17.872
How... Oh, um, usually,
you know, it's...

13:17.874 --> 13:20.342
it's just been me
from the beginning.

13:20.344 --> 13:24.946
Me too. I mean, I was
hiking solo too at first.

13:24.948 --> 13:27.115
- Oh, yeah?

13:27.117 --> 13:30.818
Well, I mean, are you...

13:30.820 --> 13:33.754

13:33.756 --> 13:36.791
Sort of. Yeah, well,
I mean, me and Bluebird met up,

13:36.793 --> 13:38.693
uh, a little while ago.

13:38.695 --> 13:41.430
And then we were hiking
with some older people

13:41.432 --> 13:45.901
and then one of them got hurt and
then just now met these folks.

13:45.903 --> 13:49.371
- Just now, yeah.
- That's how that goes.

13:49.373 --> 13:50.905
Sure you don't
want to join us?

13:50.907 --> 13:53.878
No. You know...

15:47.926 --> 15:50.929
Do you, like,
not grow leg hair?

15:58.137 --> 16:02.074
- What?
- I've just never seen you shave, that's all.

16:05.612 --> 16:10.181
Oh, no, because I got
lasered a few years ago.

16:10.183 --> 16:12.852
So it doesn't grow anywhere.

16:15.421 --> 16:20.124
Is that just 'cause, or, uh,

16:20.126 --> 16:24.864
was Pol not into le bush?

16:50.658 --> 16:55.996
- You OK?
- Yeah. I just want to be alone for a bit.

16:59.199 --> 17:01.101
What does he do?

17:02.903 --> 17:05.303
- Pol?
- Uh-huh.

17:05.305 --> 17:08.075
He's an engineer.

17:16.550 --> 17:18.886
Does he want to have kids?

17:21.556 --> 17:24.356
Kids? Kids?

17:24.358 --> 17:29.364
- Do you?
- Do I want to have kids?

17:31.932 --> 17:35.937
No.

17:38.106 --> 17:40.274
So you don't want kids?

17:41.443 --> 17:45.146
- No.
- Why?

17:46.980 --> 17:49.250
Because it's complicated.

17:53.521 --> 17:54.889
OK.

19:16.573 --> 19:18.341
I'm afraid of heights.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.551
Hey! What are you... stop!

19:30.553 --> 19:33.490
What the fuck are you doing?

19:53.142 --> 19:56.310

- My bag of chips is right there.

19:59.483 --> 20:01.783
What the fuck
are you talking about now?

20:01.785 --> 20:04.419
In my pack! Right at the bottom
of the fucking tower.

20:04.421 --> 20:09.358
- What do you mean?
- So what?

20:09.360 --> 20:13.327
So I don't want your dead body
to fall and crush my chips up.

20:13.329 --> 20:15.864
OK. Should I...
should I fall that way?

20:15.866 --> 20:18.700
- Is this way OK for you?
- Wait, wait, wait. Come over this way a little bit.

20:18.702 --> 20:21.103
- OK, yeah.
- Right here. That's a good fucking spot.

20:21.105 --> 20:23.205

I'm sorry.

21:15.660 --> 21:19.462
Can I go now?

21:19.464 --> 21:24.467
Yeah, I said you can go as long
as you fall left of my chips.

21:24.469 --> 21:27.305
We'll make sure
your chips are OK.

21:28.607 --> 21:30.809
Thank you.

- Now, open your mouth.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.774
What?

22:36.409 --> 22:39.276
Would you just close your eyes
and open your mouth?

29:56.690 --> 30:02.230
My back feels like shit!

30:04.065 --> 30:07.635
- You want me to crack it?
- Oh! What?

30:09.237 --> 30:13.104
What are you, a frog?
Get up.

30:13.106 --> 30:17.211
Come on. Don't do that.

30:21.382 --> 30:23.883
All right.

30:23.885 --> 30:27.286
Face this way.
Ow! Don't.

30:27.288 --> 30:29.788
- Don't.
- No biting. Don't.

30:29.790 --> 30:31.991
- You're smashing my tit.
- I'm sorry.

30:31.993 --> 30:33.792
- Ahh!
- You have to cooperate.

30:33.794 --> 30:35.961
- You have smashed my...
- Do you want me to do this?

30:35.963 --> 30:38.964
One... one minute
for the tit, please.

30:38.966 --> 30:42.370
- Shh! Homeboy.
- I know.

30:44.172 --> 30:46.406
- Across your chest?
- Yeah, like this.

30:46.408 --> 30:48.073
Hold on. OK.

30:48.075 --> 30:49.842
Wait, you're sure
you know how to do it?

30:49.844 --> 30:52.212
- Yes.
- OK, sign this paper.

30:52.214 --> 30:56.516
- What?
- Now put your arms like this.

30:56.518 --> 31:00.085
What the fuck?
You spit on me.

31:04.959 --> 31:08.061
- What the fuck was that?
- It went pa pa pa pa pa!

31:08.063 --> 31:10.096
- That's shit.
- Why?

31:10.098 --> 31:12.799
I heard it. I hear it.

31:12.801 --> 31:16.838
What? I'm a doctor.

31:18.173 --> 31:20.408
I see your...
I've seen your butt.

31:20.410 --> 31:24.010
- You asked. You asked.
- Give me my fucking money back!

31:24.012 --> 31:26.213
- You didn't pay me shit.
- Yeah, you are a doctor,

31:26.215 --> 31:27.914
so give me my
fucking money back.

31:27.916 --> 31:29.416
Are you saying
I'm not a good doctor?

31:29.418 --> 31:31.518
Yeah. Give me five!

31:31.520 --> 31:35.822
Rock and roll.

31:35.824 --> 31:37.425
- What?
- Nothing.

31:37.427 --> 31:38.827
Nothing.

33:32.677 --> 33:36.381
I'm going to come
off the trail at the next town.

33:44.322 --> 33:47.291
Really?

33:49.993 --> 33:53.329
Yeah. I...

33:53.331 --> 33:57.467
- I just decided I want to.
- Seriously?

33:57.469 --> 34:00.271
Yeah, it's what I want to do.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.678
- Because of earlier?
- No.

34:07.680 --> 34:11.449
No. You didn't do anything.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.386
OK.

34:16.388 --> 34:20.291
- Well, I'm sorry, I mean...
- No.

34:23.728 --> 34:29.568
You have nothing...
nothing to be sorry for.

34:34.539 --> 34:36.973
OK, but you, um...

34:36.975 --> 34:41.347
I mean, you're serious. This is
not like a joke or anything?

34:44.583 --> 34:46.985
I'm sorry.

34:48.286 --> 34:51.290
I didn't know
when to bring it up.

34:59.331 --> 35:02.399
I'm sorry. It's not
because of earlier?

35:02.401 --> 35:05.636
- No.
- No?

35:05.638 --> 35:07.571
No, it's not because of earlier.

35:07.573 --> 35:10.107
It's not because of earlier.

35:10.109 --> 35:14.211
- It's not?
- No.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.549
I've been thinking
about it for awhile.

35:17.551 --> 35:20.654
Since when?

35:23.789 --> 35:27.357
I mean, you've been thinking
about it for a while?

35:27.359 --> 35:30.227
Sh.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.698
We'll talk tomorrow.

35:33.700 --> 35:37.504
OK? We talk tomorrow.

36:06.467 --> 36:10.401
What are you writing?

36:10.403 --> 36:14.305
So far I have Lake Nobo.

36:14.307 --> 36:16.576
Then I drew
a little lightning bolt.

36:23.116 --> 36:28.089
So do you just want me to, like,
say goodbye and that's it?

36:30.424 --> 36:34.125
Just like, "Party on, Wayne."

36:34.127 --> 36:37.097
And that's it? I just don't...
I don't know what you want.

36:40.100 --> 36:45.437
Can we try to enjoy today,
and that's it?

36:45.439 --> 36:49.708
- Yo. How's it going?
- Hey.

36:49.710 --> 36:53.580
Pretty good. Pretty good.

36:53.582 --> 36:56.315
Is there... is there room?

36:56.317 --> 36:58.484
- Are you OK?
- What? Yeah.

36:58.486 --> 37:01.754
I just have a rock
or a stick or something.

37:01.756 --> 37:04.156
- This is Cheese. I'm Hermes.
- Hey.

37:04.158 --> 37:05.591
- I'm Bluebird.
- Lake.

37:05.593 --> 37:10.129
- Morning, guys.
- Hey, Bluebird.

37:10.131 --> 37:12.568
You fellers hungry?

37:16.271 --> 37:19.739
- Y'all hiking together?
- Yeah.

37:19.741 --> 37:23.475
Yeah?
Going all the way up?

37:23.477 --> 37:26.211
- Mm-hm.
- Nice.

37:26.213 --> 37:29.248
Yeah. Well...

37:29.250 --> 37:33.386
I think she's quitting and
going home like tomorrow.

37:33.388 --> 37:37.490
You're quitting?
Are you...

37:37.492 --> 37:39.793
Are you just like
not feeling it or...

37:39.795 --> 37:41.796
No, it's not...
it's not like that.

37:41.798 --> 37:43.831
- OK, yeah.
- It happens.

37:43.833 --> 37:46.432
No. No, it's not like that.

37:46.434 --> 37:50.270
Yeah, it's just more like shear
bravery and courage mostly.

37:50.272 --> 37:53.173
- Courage?
- I don't know, you tell me.

37:53.175 --> 37:55.275
No, you tell me.
You know everything, right?

37:55.277 --> 37:57.212
I guess so.

38:45.595 --> 38:47.430
Stop.

38:58.775 --> 39:01.778
What did you mean
by "Party on, Wayne" before?

39:03.579 --> 39:05.713
You've never seen that movie?

39:05.715 --> 39:08.516
No.

39:08.518 --> 39:13.488
Well, it's about these guys
and they have this cable show.

39:13.490 --> 39:18.395
And when they sign off they say, "Party
on, Wayne" or, "Party on, Garth."

39:19.596 --> 39:25.301
- It's just a stupid thing.
- OK.

39:43.988 --> 39:48.224
We are doing such
a great job enjoying today.

39:51.995 --> 39:56.065
- I am, actually.
- Oh, yeah?

39:56.067 --> 40:00.370
Yeah, because I get to meet up
with Cheese and Hermes later.

40:06.745 --> 40:10.479
Hey, do you
still keep a journal?

40:10.481 --> 40:13.715
No, I ran out of space.

40:13.717 --> 40:15.885
Yeah, but you still have it,
right?

40:15.887 --> 40:18.022
Yeah.

40:20.525 --> 40:23.628
Would you read me something
you've written here?

40:26.464 --> 40:30.000
- No.
- Why not?

40:30.002 --> 40:32.637
Because I don't want to.

40:38.476 --> 40:42.347
Could you just look and see if
something is acceptable to read?

40:54.093 --> 40:55.761
Sit up.

40:58.630 --> 41:01.397
Can you give me
some context first?

41:01.399 --> 41:07.938
Yeah, um... that's from
when we first got here.

41:07.940 --> 41:10.073
- Here, like the U.S.?
- Yeah.

41:10.075 --> 41:12.142
OK.

41:12.144 --> 41:16.613
And then I spent some days

41:16.615 --> 41:19.150
in California by myself.

41:19.152 --> 41:22.552
And then I wrote that.

41:22.554 --> 41:26.056
I was swimming a lot
in the ocean.

41:26.058 --> 41:28.091
You won't get it.

41:28.093 --> 41:31.662
Really? What,
it's too deep for me?

41:31.664 --> 41:33.764
Maybe.

41:33.766 --> 41:36.937
OK. We'll see.

42:54.215 --> 42:56.849
- And that's it.
- Hm.

42:56.851 --> 42:59.819
It was really good.

43:01.022 --> 43:03.655
You got it?

43:03.657 --> 43:07.960
Got like...

43:07.962 --> 43:11.263
And...

43:11.265 --> 43:12.798
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.833
- Very good.
- Thanks.

43:14.835 --> 43:18.837
Can you just give me a...
like, a quick recap in English?

43:18.839 --> 43:24.011
Yeah. Quick recap
is basically that...

43:36.959 --> 43:38.860
Mm...

43:48.903 --> 43:52.040
Is that... that I need no one.

43:55.643 --> 43:57.679
And it's OK.

44:04.152 --> 44:07.989
I don't think
I've ever felt that way.

44:07.991 --> 44:11.224
Do you still...
do you still feel that way?

44:11.226 --> 44:14.062
That you will never need anyone?

44:21.237 --> 44:24.338
I mean, it's not like
I hate everybody.

44:24.340 --> 44:27.607
- You know?
- I don't know.

44:27.609 --> 44:33.880
I mean, I feel like I needed you
or someone after my dad left.

44:33.882 --> 44:37.351
I mean, I thought that was why
we started hiking together.

44:37.353 --> 44:40.754
I started hiking with you
because I wanted to,

44:40.756 --> 44:43.159
not because I needed.

44:50.166 --> 44:52.201
Yeah, but...

44:54.804 --> 44:56.771
I mean, now you're going...

44:56.773 --> 45:00.141
you're leaving to go be
with your husband. That...

45:00.143 --> 45:03.079
seems kind of contradictory.

45:11.854 --> 45:13.689
I don't know.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.294
Did you have some sort
of epiphany or something?

45:19.296 --> 45:21.395
I mean, is...

45:21.397 --> 45:25.201
Is the next journal entry
about that?

45:26.235 --> 45:28.336
Where is that one?

45:28.338 --> 45:34.276
Um... I ran out of space.

45:34.278 --> 45:36.914
I mean, you could just tell me.

45:39.383 --> 45:41.783
What are you so upset about?

45:41.785 --> 45:43.885
I'm not. I'm not upset.
I just...

45:43.887 --> 45:46.221
I don't know,
I've never felt like that

45:46.223 --> 45:48.423
or thought about that, really.

45:48.425 --> 45:55.132
Never, like someone
telling you...

46:25.096 --> 46:27.730
I know you probably think
I'm really stupid and shallow

46:27.732 --> 46:32.034
because I'm not like as aware
or something as you, but...

46:32.036 --> 46:34.169
I'm not thinking
that you're stupid.

46:34.171 --> 46:36.171
It's just every time I try
to put my feelings into words

46:36.173 --> 46:38.274
it just sounds fucking stupid.

46:38.276 --> 46:41.944
It's not fucking stupid.

46:41.946 --> 46:46.449
And I sound fucking stupid every
fucking day of my fucking life.

46:46.451 --> 46:51.789
And that's OK.
I mean, that's... that's OK.

46:54.058 --> 46:58.461
And don't say that. I mean,
that's fucking bullshit.

46:58.463 --> 47:01.998
Like the song yesterday.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.968
What?

47:07.038 --> 47:09.972
I've never had to pee
that bad in my whole life.

47:09.974 --> 47:11.910
And I couldn't leave.

47:13.078 --> 47:15.147
That was amazing.

47:20.052 --> 47:22.418
At the end,
you cured me of urination.

47:25.023 --> 47:27.459
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:30.329 --> 47:32.896
- What?
- Nothing.

47:32.898 --> 47:37.334
I mean, I have been known
to dampen the panties.

47:37.336 --> 47:40.237
You did the opposite.
You cured me of urination, so...

47:40.239 --> 47:43.040
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- ...my panties were there

47:43.042 --> 47:45.444
the whole time.

47:47.946 --> 47:49.812
You know, like a sponge?

47:49.814 --> 47:52.149
Like Bob Esponja.

47:52.151 --> 47:56.153
- Like what?
- Bob Esponja.

47:56.155 --> 47:59.357
It's a sponge
that lives inside the ocean

47:59.359 --> 48:02.027
- and it looks like cheese.
- Wait.

48:03.862 --> 48:05.997
Are you talking
about SpongeBob?

48:05.999 --> 48:09.033
- Yeah. That's a name?
- Yeah. Oh, my God.

48:09.035 --> 48:14.338
SpongeBob,
is that better Bob Sponge?

48:14.340 --> 48:16.842
Bob Esponja.

48:27.354 --> 48:30.390
- Bob Esponja.
- Yeah.

48:43.970 --> 48:45.570
Yeah, I'd love some. Oh, my God.

48:45.572 --> 48:47.338
- You want some too, sweetheart?
- Yeah.

48:47.340 --> 48:49.007
- Yeah, I want some.
- We're starving.

48:49.009 --> 48:51.310
All right. I figured
on a trail like that,

48:51.312 --> 48:54.078
- you would be tired and hungry.
- Thank you.

48:54.080 --> 48:58.383
And... help yourself.
I've got water and coffee.

48:58.385 --> 49:01.486
- You have coffee?
- Oh, I have coffee, yes.

49:01.488 --> 49:04.289
See, I make the best coffee too
to go along with the best chili.

49:04.291 --> 49:07.559
Now, where else you going
to get a greeting like this?

49:07.561 --> 49:10.296
- I don't know.
- I mean, when you got the best, you got it.

49:10.298 --> 49:12.998
- Lake, I'm glad to meet you.
- Bluebird.

49:13.000 --> 49:14.900
- Blueberry. Oh, I love blueberries.
- Yeah.

49:14.902 --> 49:18.037
- Bluebird.
- Oh. I'll fly with you.

49:18.039 --> 49:20.105
- Can I give you an angel?
- An angel? What is it?

49:20.107 --> 49:22.240
Yeah. Here, let me give you
an angel to put on.

49:22.242 --> 49:25.377
Yellow is for boy
because he's shy of girls.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.113
The white is for girl
because she's pure.

49:28.115 --> 49:30.115
- 'Cause God loves you.
- Thank you.

49:30.117 --> 49:33.252
I come down here to serve people
because I like giving to others

49:33.254 --> 49:37.156
and help them. Especially when you
come down that trail, you are cold.

49:37.158 --> 49:39.258
- Yeah.
- You're... you're tired.

49:39.260 --> 49:43.028
And you're hungry.
And you got a long way to go

49:43.030 --> 49:45.297
to get something to eat.
It's whiskey.

49:45.299 --> 49:48.133
- Whiskey.
- Yeah, I just give you a little bit.

49:48.135 --> 49:52.905
- Oh!
- And I can't drink. I don't drink.

49:52.907 --> 49:55.040
- But a friend of mine gave that to me.
- You're a lifesaver.

49:55.042 --> 49:57.009
I want to share it with you.
If you like,

49:57.011 --> 49:59.446
I'll give you the rest of it
to take with you.

49:59.448 --> 50:03.516
But promise me one thing. You just drink
what I gave you here, no more than that.

50:03.518 --> 50:05.585
And do it
in medicinable purposes.

50:05.587 --> 50:08.288
And you'll be so much healthier,
happier and sleepier.

50:08.290 --> 50:11.190
- Thank you very much.
- You got a good woman there. Listen to her.

50:11.192 --> 50:13.992
- I know. I try to.
- She's trying to protect you.

50:13.994 --> 50:15.662
She's trying to be good to you.

50:15.664 --> 50:18.231
And she doesn't
want you getting drunk.

50:18.233 --> 50:21.634
- There you go, girl.
- I won't get too drunk. I won't get too drunk.

50:21.636 --> 50:23.970
- I'll make it last until...
- No, really, it's not necessary. It's not necessary.

50:23.972 --> 50:26.039
This is going to last me
all the way to Maine.

50:26.041 --> 50:28.208
- All the way to Maine?
- All the way to the end of the trail.

50:28.210 --> 50:30.243
I'll take the very last shot
as soon as we finish.

50:30.245 --> 50:32.178
- No. Come on. Just...
- You can have some of it too.

50:32.180 --> 50:34.247
I'm not going
to drink it all myself.

51:01.376 --> 51:04.478
Hey, we should
have a fire tonight.

51:04.480 --> 51:08.183
- Why?
- Because it's your last night.

51:10.353 --> 51:12.688
You're not tired?

51:31.441 --> 51:33.574
I wish you the best of
luck. And if you get too cold,

51:33.576 --> 51:37.244
you know, just throw some
clothes on. It's not worth it.

51:37.246 --> 51:39.748
- We'll see.
- OK.

51:42.386 --> 51:44.386
Alrighty, hey. One more time.

51:44.388 --> 51:47.154
Oh, Ratman, Ratman.
Yeah, Lake?

51:47.156 --> 51:49.123
- Lake, yeah.
- What's your real name?

51:49.125 --> 51:51.325
- It doesn't matter.
- You're right, it doesn't matter.

51:51.327 --> 51:53.260
- Good luck out there, man.
- You too.

51:53.262 --> 51:56.667
Be safe. Follow your heart.

53:18.283 --> 53:22.286
You should get a phone tomorrow
in town. Just in case.

53:27.158 --> 53:29.825
I actually wasn't thinking
about going into town.

53:29.827 --> 53:31.663
Why not?

53:33.531 --> 53:35.264
There's really no point.

53:35.266 --> 53:38.604
I mean, I've got enough food
for a few more days.

53:45.243 --> 53:47.510
Do you want me to?

53:47.512 --> 53:50.481
I don't know, it's up to you.

53:58.257 --> 54:00.691
Would you use mine
if I give it to you?

54:00.693 --> 54:02.659
- Your phone?
- Yeah.

54:02.661 --> 54:07.665
No. It's yours. And plus,
I don't really need it.

54:07.667 --> 54:11.535
Well, actually you need it. I mean,
you're in the middle of fucking nothing.

54:11.537 --> 54:14.805
So just in case if some
something happens, you need it.

54:14.807 --> 54:17.741
You don't have to use it.
I never use mine, but...

54:17.743 --> 54:20.145
Sounds like I really
need it then.

54:29.589 --> 54:32.791
OK, then don't. OK?

54:39.531 --> 54:42.501
- You want to try some of that whiskey?
- No.

54:52.679 --> 54:54.681
To cell phones.

55:05.692 --> 55:08.893
- Wait.
- What?

55:08.895 --> 55:11.529
- You cannot drink yet.
- Well, you didn't want to toast.

55:11.531 --> 55:14.869
- I don't have to wait for you.
- I don't want to cheers to cell phones.

55:20.541 --> 55:22.308
To Maine.

55:24.344 --> 55:25.812
To Maine.

55:27.681 --> 55:29.482
To Maine.

55:42.863 --> 55:45.697
You know, I was thinking before
that it's hard for me to think

55:45.699 --> 55:48.769
about you outside of here.

55:49.870 --> 55:52.437
- Why?
- I don't know.

55:52.439 --> 55:56.775
Because maybe I... I met you here
and I've seen you just hiking here.

55:56.777 --> 56:01.915
And... I know you like that.
And... I don't know.

56:01.917 --> 56:04.618
Cannot imagine you in a...

56:06.287 --> 56:09.824
swimming pool, for example.

56:14.729 --> 56:16.530
That's funny.

56:22.904 --> 56:25.841
So what would you do after?

56:28.376 --> 56:29.978
What is that?

56:32.080 --> 56:34.913
Ah, I had a tick.

56:34.915 --> 56:38.051
- On your leg?
- No, my head.

56:38.053 --> 56:40.655
Oh, fuck me.

56:43.492 --> 56:47.594
After, uh... I don't know.

56:47.596 --> 56:49.329
I got to figure it out,
I guess.

56:49.331 --> 56:51.698
But have you ever
had a job, like...?

56:51.700 --> 56:53.767
Yeah, I've had a job.

56:53.769 --> 56:57.469
I'm not like one of those
trust fund hikers or something.

56:59.541 --> 57:01.908
You know?
I've had lots of jobs.

57:01.910 --> 57:04.444
- Oh, yeah, lots of jobs?
- Yeah.

57:04.446 --> 57:08.983
Yeah. I... I was a minor league
baseball team mascot.

57:08.985 --> 57:11.852
- Really?
- Uh-huh. I...

57:11.854 --> 57:15.790
delivered those prepackaged
sandwiches to gas stations.

57:15.792 --> 57:17.958
Stop.

57:17.960 --> 57:20.827
I did a carriage tour
in Charleston for one summer.

57:20.829 --> 57:26.133
And then, um, and then I did the
cruise ship thing for one year.

57:26.135 --> 57:29.602
You were a mascot?

57:29.604 --> 57:31.872
Wally T. Warthog, yeah.

57:31.874 --> 57:34.441
- What is it, a bear?
- No, it's a...

57:34.443 --> 57:36.777
It's a hog... a warthog,
like a mean pig.

57:36.779 --> 57:38.746
- A mean pig?
- Yeah.

57:38.748 --> 57:41.082
Ah. I've seen it.
Like with teeth.

57:41.084 --> 57:43.987
- Yeah.
- It's ugly.

57:45.587 --> 57:47.453
Were you dancing?

57:47.455 --> 57:48.856
You know,
where they go like...

57:48.858 --> 57:50.658
- With a big head.
- Uh-huh.

57:50.660 --> 57:55.029
They say, "And now,
our team mascot,

57:55.031 --> 57:58.599
Wally T. Warthog!"

57:58.601 --> 58:02.070
I'd run out and I'd go...

58:02.072 --> 58:04.806
"Wally!

58:04.808 --> 58:07.075
I love you, Wally!

58:07.077 --> 58:09.677
Blow me, Wally!"

58:09.679 --> 58:12.112
Or wait, "I want to blow you,
Wally!"

58:12.114 --> 58:16.053
No way.
Shut the fuck up.

58:17.787 --> 58:20.023
It was something like that.

58:27.731 --> 58:31.167
Why were you doing
all these jobs?

58:31.169 --> 58:36.106
Well, I had like a weird financial
situation when I was growing up.

58:37.540 --> 58:39.774
Why?

58:39.776 --> 58:41.643
I don't know
if they do this in Spain,

58:41.645 --> 58:44.746
but here if one
of your parents dies

58:44.748 --> 58:47.816
when you're really young,
then, um, the government

58:47.818 --> 58:51.488
will send you checks every month
till your 18.

59:01.965 --> 59:04.401
Hey, do you want to play a game?

59:06.703 --> 59:08.703
- Is it a man?
- Well, yeah.

59:08.705 --> 59:11.741
- Am I a woman?
- No.

59:11.743 --> 59:18.180
Am I... am I a... spaceship?

59:18.182 --> 59:21.183
A what?
You're not a fucking spaceship.

59:21.185 --> 59:23.485
- I'm an old witch.
- No!

59:23.487 --> 59:25.988
- You're not an old witch.
- I'm an old witch.

59:25.990 --> 59:30.826
- Wally witch...
- And I have to....

59:30.828 --> 59:33.262
- Wait, I need a pot.
- You are a fucking pig.

59:33.264 --> 59:36.266
- Ow!
- You are a fucking pig.

59:36.268 --> 59:39.269
- What the fuck?
- You have to get lower.

59:39.271 --> 59:42.105
I think you are
the worst Wally Bear thing...

59:42.107 --> 59:45.141
- Bend your knees.
- ...you've ever had.

59:45.143 --> 59:48.244
Let's go find a bear.
Let's go kill a bear.

59:48.246 --> 59:50.146
OK. Let's go.

59:57.855 --> 01:00:02.793
That's... that was great.
You don't spit.

01:00:02.795 --> 01:00:04.997
- You don't spit.
- It was a poop.

01:00:13.972 --> 01:00:16.141
That was so weird.

01:00:46.306 --> 01:00:48.274
Are you there?

01:00:59.184 --> 01:01:02.154
Did you ever read
that children's book?

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:07.791
It has a little
dopey bird in it.

01:01:07.793 --> 01:01:13.731
And he hatches one day
when his mom,

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:15.967
also a bird,

01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:18.805
is out to get some worms.

01:01:20.806 --> 01:01:23.007
And so he goes around...

01:01:23.009 --> 01:01:26.844
I don't know how, 'cause most
little babies can't walk.

01:01:26.846 --> 01:01:28.679
But this little baby can.

01:01:28.681 --> 01:01:34.587
And so he goes around,
he goes up to this cat.

01:01:36.189 --> 01:01:42.727
And he asks the cat,
"Are you my mom?"

01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:45.797
And the cat says, "Nope."

01:01:45.799 --> 01:01:49.200
So then he goes over to the dog.

01:01:49.202 --> 01:01:54.306
And asks the dog,
"Are you my mom?"

01:01:54.308 --> 01:01:57.742
The dog says no.

01:01:57.744 --> 01:02:00.747
So then he goes over to the cow.

01:02:04.885 --> 01:02:08.955
And he asked the cow,
"Are you my mom?"

01:02:44.992 --> 01:02:48.096
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.709
I can't have kids.

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:09.945
What?

01:04:15.985 --> 01:04:18.321
I can't have kids.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:26.430
Even if I wanted to.
It doesn't work right.

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.285
Look at me.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:26.189
So, what does the cow say?

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.362
"How could I be your mom?

01:05:33.398 --> 01:05:35.466
I'm a cow."

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.553
- Hey!
- Hey, how you doing?

01:08:08.555 --> 01:08:10.154
- Good.
- Need a ride, I take it?

01:08:10.156 --> 01:08:11.756
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.257
I'm kind of piled up here,

01:08:13.259 --> 01:08:14.793
so if you don't mind
hopping in back.

01:08:14.795 --> 01:08:16.461
- Yeah, sure, great.
- OK, all right.

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:18.564
Not going far,
but I'll help you what I can.

01:08:18.566 --> 01:08:20.532
All right. Are you going
through Daleville?

01:08:20.533 --> 01:08:23.402
- Uh, sure, sure, I can do that. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:08:23.404 --> 01:08:25.706
- Hop in, hop in.
- Good.

01:08:27.541 --> 01:08:29.608
- Thanks.
- Jump in.

01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:31.343
Move what you got
to move back there.

01:08:31.345 --> 01:08:33.679
- Thank you so much.
- You bet. You got it.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.314
Find yourself a spot.
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

01:08:36.316 --> 01:08:39.250
- I'm good, how are you?
- Great.

01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:43.555
- How's the hike been?
- Not too bad.

01:08:43.557 --> 01:08:46.760
- Thanks for the ride.
- All right, settle in.

01:08:48.496 --> 01:08:50.362
Everybody good?

01:08:50.363 --> 01:08:52.399
- Yeah.
- OK.

01:10:21.891 --> 01:10:24.393
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

01:10:28.865 --> 01:10:31.165
Do you mind
if we take this table?

01:10:31.167 --> 01:10:33.601
Sit anywhere you want to,
darlin'. I ain't picky at all.

01:10:33.603 --> 01:10:35.168
Thank you.

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:37.170
- Thanks.
- Howdy, howdy.

01:10:37.172 --> 01:10:39.340
Everybody doing OK
this morning?

01:10:39.342 --> 01:10:41.508
What you want to drink,
sweetie?

01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:43.844
Uh, coffee and water.

01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:46.280
All right.
How about you, sweetie?

01:10:46.282 --> 01:10:48.248
- Same.
- All right.

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:49.751
You want to look at that
there menu for a minute,

01:10:49.753 --> 01:10:51.418
or you know what you want,
darlin'?

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.789
Uh... do you have eggs?

01:10:54.791 --> 01:10:56.690
Oh, sure.
How do you like 'em cooked?

01:10:56.692 --> 01:10:58.559
- Scrambled.
- Alrighty.

01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:01.762
- How about you, sweetie?
- I'm OK for now, thanks.

01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:04.231
- All that hiking and no food?
- Yeah.

01:11:04.233 --> 01:11:06.369
- I'll be back, darlin'.
- OK.

01:11:39.302 --> 01:11:42.940
Howdy. Come on in, pick you a
spot and I'll be right with you.

01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:59.021
I think after this, we...
we should say goodbye.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:01.356
Here you go, sweetie.

01:12:01.358 --> 01:12:03.659
- Thanks.
- You're so welcome.

01:12:03.661 --> 01:12:06.328
Them there eggs will be done
here in just a minute.

01:12:06.330 --> 01:12:08.931
- OK, thanks.
- And I'll be right back out with them, OK?

01:12:08.933 --> 01:12:11.468
You change your mind,
I'll feed you, darlin'.

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:41.799
You should eat something.

01:12:49.842 --> 01:12:52.644
- Will you take the phone?
- No.

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:19.003
I didn't know you
were coming off the trail.

01:13:19.005 --> 01:13:21.004
Jesus. Are you serious?

01:13:21.006 --> 01:13:23.106
I didn't... I didn't know it.

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:25.609
You didn't know?

01:13:25.611 --> 01:13:28.078
Sorry.

01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.480
OK.

01:13:30.482 --> 01:13:32.682
- Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:13:32.684 --> 01:13:35.452
- Where's your restroom?
- Right through them there doors, darlin'.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:37.589
You're so welcome.

01:15:01.742 --> 01:15:03.675
- Sorry.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:03.677 --> 01:15:05.546
No, it's OK.

01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:01.770
How you doing?

01:16:10.245 --> 01:16:12.047
You OK?

01:16:20.889 --> 01:16:23.589
I'm Spencer.

01:16:23.591 --> 01:16:25.161
Nice to meet you.

01:16:33.168 --> 01:16:35.103
Where you from?

01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:40.475
Guess what?

01:16:43.312 --> 01:16:50.219
If you are wrong, you fly away.

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:39.197
Should I run over these deputy sheriffs
or just let them be there dumb?

01:18:40.932 --> 01:18:42.298
How's your hiking going?

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:45.801
Two weeks I was in the hospital.

01:18:45.803 --> 01:18:50.906
Gosh, that's terrible, huh?
What? Did you get bad food?

01:18:50.908 --> 01:18:53.210
- I had a tick.
- Oh.

01:18:53.212 --> 01:18:56.879
Uh, was it the one
that carries the Lyme disease.

01:18:56.881 --> 01:19:00.683
- Yeah.
- Oh, shucks. Are you OK now?

01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:04.153
- Perfect.
- Oh, well, that's one good thing.

01:19:04.155 --> 01:19:08.023
You meet some extremely
nice people on the trail.

01:19:08.025 --> 01:19:10.860
I'm not worried about that. I
just want to make it, you know?

01:19:10.862 --> 01:19:14.331
- Yeah.
- I just want to go there and make it.

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:19.169
You know, you have certain
phases in life that you want...

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:21.770
You don't want to be tied down
and then you have times

01:19:21.772 --> 01:19:25.375
that you want to settle down
and do nothing but go to work,

01:19:25.377 --> 01:19:29.279
come home and spend time
with your... your wife.

01:19:29.281 --> 01:19:35.485
And... but you have to make your
mind up in your young years,

01:19:35.487 --> 01:19:38.054
what's more important to you.

01:19:38.056 --> 01:19:41.158
And if marriage
is the most important thing

01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:43.726
and raising a family,
and at one time,

01:19:43.728 --> 01:19:45.295
you know, I thought that was it.

01:19:45.297 --> 01:19:49.466
Then my first wife,
she got on prescription drugs

01:19:49.468 --> 01:19:51.168
and really got bad and stuff.

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:53.737
And, you know, imagining things,

01:19:53.739 --> 01:19:56.339
which was far from truth
and stuff.

01:19:56.341 --> 01:19:59.343
And there's a house I built.

01:19:59.345 --> 01:20:02.812
The rest is unpleasant history
for the second wife.

01:20:02.814 --> 01:20:05.749
So that does end.

01:20:05.751 --> 01:20:09.519
I'm educated and all that,
so if a third ever comes along,

01:20:09.521 --> 01:20:11.522
it should be a charm.

01:20:11.524 --> 01:20:13.757
- Are you happy now?
- Yeah.

01:20:13.759 --> 01:20:15.359
- Yeah, I am.
- That's it.

01:20:15.361 --> 01:20:16.793
Yeah, you know, I'm real happy,

01:20:16.795 --> 01:20:18.962
because...

01:20:18.964 --> 01:20:23.868
I do about everything
I want to do.

01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:27.471
Other than that,
I have a good friend or two.

01:20:27.473 --> 01:20:31.175
And, you know,
and I ride my horses

01:20:31.177 --> 01:20:35.914
and shoot my gun,
and work like hell.

01:22:20.913 --> 01:22:25.913
