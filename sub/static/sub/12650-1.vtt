WEBVTT

01:05.498 --> 01:07.900
- Party wagon in full
effect, yo!

01:07.902 --> 01:08.700
- In full effect?

01:08.702 --> 01:11.203
We're losin' tiger claw.
Move it, leo.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.838
Hm, according
to the gps it looks like

01:12.840 --> 01:15.441
They're heading to the new york
natural history museum.

01:15.443 --> 01:19.278
- Dude, I hear they have an
awesome laser show at midnight.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.246
- I doubt they're going
to a laser show, mikey.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.515
Ten bucks and four peanut
butter-pepperoni pizzas

01:23.517 --> 01:25.451
Says they're out
to steal something.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.920
- Duh! I bet it's
a new helmet for shredder...

01:27.922 --> 01:31.323
Like red with spikes
all over it,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.859
And maybe with tassels.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.663
- What?
Tassels are cool!

01:37.665 --> 01:40.833
- Stay focused, ninjas.
We're getting close.

01:42.403 --> 01:46.672
- Oh, I no like this van.
Is too small.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.940
My knees is cramped.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.908
I getting charley the horse.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.243
- Stop complaining, rocksteady.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.811
I'm the one who has
to drive you guys around.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.715
- Will you two imbeciles
be quiet for ten seconds!

01:56.717 --> 02:00.853
I'm creating a plan
to steal the kronite.

02:00.855 --> 02:04.423
- Okey dokeys.
I says nothing, comrade.

02:04.425 --> 02:05.657
- You're talking right now!

02:05.659 --> 02:07.559
- He got you there, rocksteady.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.964
- Now you're both talking.
I can't take it.

02:16.904 --> 02:20.405
Rocksteady:

02:33.854 --> 02:34.786
Ah!

02:34.788 --> 02:37.322
Oh, dudes, so cool.

02:37.324 --> 02:41.627
- Don't touch anything, mikey.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.462
- Ohhh...

02:45.599 --> 02:47.900
- Are those real
dinosaur bones, d?

02:47.902 --> 02:49.001
- They're fossils.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.570
You see, when the bones
are buried in...

02:51.572 --> 02:52.738
- Could you wake me up

02:52.740 --> 02:54.740
After all the science-y
exposition?

02:54.742 --> 02:55.841
Awesome. Thanks.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.644
Shhh, here they come.

02:58.646 --> 02:59.444
- Hm, I kinda spaced out

02:59.446 --> 03:01.847
When shredder told us
what the mission was.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.551
- We's looking for
the meeteetorite, bebop.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.352
Is big rock from space, yah?

03:07.354 --> 03:08.620
Has some kind of
special prooperties.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.956
- Prooperties?
You said prooperties.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.493
- the meteorite
is an energy source...

03:14.495 --> 03:17.396
Extremely powerful
and incredibly rare.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.399
It fell to earth over
100 million years ago.

03:20.401 --> 03:24.803
- Yes, back when primitive
cave persons walked earth.

03:24.805 --> 03:29.107
- Humans didn't exist
back then, rockhead!

03:29.109 --> 03:33.378
- How many times I tell
you is rocksteady?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.683
- Those two were never
the sharpest crayons in the box.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.785
- What's the deal,
fearless leader?

03:39.787 --> 03:41.587
- You and donny take rocksteady.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.523
Mikey, you've got bebop.
I'll take tiger claw.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.496
- Huh?

03:51.498 --> 03:54.366
Ohhh...

03:57.071 --> 03:59.104
The kronite.

03:59.106 --> 03:59.972
- Is pretty.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.674
- You could make a killer
disco ball outta that.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.443
It'd be tight!

04:14.955 --> 04:15.955
Whew!

04:18.826 --> 04:21.426
Mikey!

04:21.428 --> 04:22.828
- Turtles? Here?

04:26.834 --> 04:27.899
- Oh, snap!

04:27.901 --> 04:30.569
It's all light ditty-com.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.973
- Haven't you learned by now?

04:34.975 --> 04:39.044
I am a sensei and you
are barely a student!

04:40.848 --> 04:42.614
- Hold still, current.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.716
You got nothin' on bebop, baby.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.719
- Oh, no, you don't!

04:47.721 --> 04:49.955
Huh?

04:54.662 --> 04:55.827
- Donny!

04:55.829 --> 04:58.597
- Over here, rocksteady!

04:59.800 --> 05:03.935
- I squishes you like
the blueberry.

05:06.106 --> 05:10.742
- Rocksteady hate
when this happen.

05:10.744 --> 05:14.613
Oh!

05:22.156 --> 05:25.090
- Huh?
- What's this?

05:30.030 --> 05:31.897
- Oh!

05:31.899 --> 05:34.766
- Got the space rock.
Let's haul shell.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.601
- I second that.

05:36.603 --> 05:37.603
- Ahhhhh!

05:43.177 --> 05:45.711
Yah!

05:45.713 --> 05:47.045
- Hey?

05:47.047 --> 05:49.514
- No.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.529
- Whaddup, ice cream kitty?

06:04.531 --> 06:06.698
Playin' some marion cart,
little friend?

06:07.768 --> 06:11.536
- I'm gonna examine
the meteorite in my lab.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.804
It's so cool.
- Great.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.541
Get back to us on that while
we play some video games.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.643
- I call next game.

06:20.814 --> 06:24.116
- It's messed up,
ice cream kitty.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.189
- How's it goin', d?

06:31.191 --> 06:33.091
- The energy per square inch
this thing emanates

06:33.093 --> 06:34.826
Is off the charts.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.663
- It's even more powerful
than the krang energy crystals.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.099
- So, can you use it to power up
your super secret project

06:41.101 --> 06:42.968
That I'm not supposed
to know about?

06:42.970 --> 06:46.104
- What is it?
- A turtle tank or something?

06:46.106 --> 06:47.873
- No.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.075
It is much more than that.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.980
Ta-da,
it's my new shell-former...

06:54.982 --> 06:57.816
A triple-changing
vehicle that can fly,

06:57.818 --> 07:00.852
Roll on treads,
and even transform

07:00.854 --> 07:02.254
Into a turtlebot!

07:02.256 --> 07:06.124
- A turtle robot
that transforms?

07:06.126 --> 07:10.629
Dude! Dude! Dude!

07:10.631 --> 07:11.129
- I know.

07:11.131 --> 07:14.132
I'll just add the crystals
as a power source.

07:14.134 --> 07:14.866
- Forget it, donny.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.601
We're taking that meteor
back to the museum

07:16.603 --> 07:18.870
First thing tomorrow night.
- Bad call.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.605
Shredder's gang will
just steal it again.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.842
- Yeah, in the wrong hands,
it's beyond dangerous.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.644
- I wanna see it transform.

07:28.582 --> 07:29.114
- Hm....

07:29.116 --> 07:31.716
Test out a huge, oversized
transforming robo-mech

07:31.718 --> 07:33.785
In the middle of new york?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.821
I'm down.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.841
- A close watch on those
turtles, rocksteady.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.976
My piggy nose is never wrong.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.378
- Yah, we going to bring turtles

08:00.380 --> 08:03.148
And meeteetorite to shredder.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.952
Maybe he even let us keep
cool-looking fang.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.386
- Not to sound like a bummer...

08:08.388 --> 08:10.255
- Uh, you'll sound
like one anyway?

08:10.257 --> 08:13.291
- This is a super
crazy bad idea...

08:13.293 --> 08:16.094
Like accent on
the "super crazy bad" part.

08:16.096 --> 08:19.264
Have I mentioned it's
also a really terrible idea?

08:19.266 --> 08:20.932
- Let's test this puppy out.

08:20.934 --> 08:23.869
And remember,
anyone who bothers me...

08:23.871 --> 08:26.071
Ejector seat button's
right there.

08:26.073 --> 08:30.242
Yes, the crystals are working!

08:30.244 --> 08:32.110
We're at 100 percent power.

08:32.111 --> 08:35.413
- Ooh, can we test out
"robot mode" first?

08:35.414 --> 08:39.116
- Mikey. Ejector seat.
- Hmph!

08:39.119 --> 08:41.285
- Let's test out
"rocket jet" mode.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.988
- Rocket jet mode, it is.

08:47.261 --> 08:51.429
- Come on, rock.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.907
- Maybe not so good idea.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.018
- Oh, no!
- Whoa! Hold on, comrade!

09:17.157 --> 09:20.025
Volcanos!

09:20.027 --> 09:22.827
- Volcanos! Donny, turn!

09:41.515 --> 09:42.480
- Is everyone okay?

09:42.482 --> 09:47.886
- Not gonna say this was
an awful idea, but, uh...

09:47.888 --> 09:49.921
Where are we, donny?

09:49.923 --> 09:57.362
- Somehow we time-warped back
100 million years into the past.

10:04.371 --> 10:08.239
- We're... We're
in prehistoric times?

10:08.241 --> 10:09.507
- Specifically the cretaceous,

10:09.509 --> 10:12.377
You know, give or take
20 or 30 million years.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.513
- Whoa, ho, ho.
Look at this place.

10:15.515 --> 10:19.150
It's amazeballs!

10:19.152 --> 10:23.388
- Wow, is that like
a spikeadon or something?

10:23.390 --> 10:25.857
- It's a stegosaurus.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.159
Uh, I wouldn't get too close.

10:28.161 --> 10:30.862
Aw, it really likes me.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.264
Can we keep it?
Can we? Please?

10:33.266 --> 10:36.601
- What do you think the answer
to that question is, mikey?

10:36.603 --> 10:37.603
Absolutely yes!

10:37.604 --> 10:41.206
- Donny, how the heck did
we end up in this nightmare?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.874
- I... I don't know.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.242
It must be the kronite.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.910
When it overheated,
it somehow created

10:45.912 --> 10:48.013
A temporal wormhole in
the time-space continuum...

10:48.015 --> 10:49.981
- Blah! Blah! Blah!
Blah! Blah! Blah!

10:49.983 --> 10:52.117
Is that supposed
to make sense to me

10:52.119 --> 10:53.418
Or anyone else listening?

10:53.420 --> 10:55.520
Who do you think
we are... nasa?

10:55.522 --> 10:58.556
- We went back in time!

10:59.526 --> 11:04.462
- Well, either way,
this is awesome!

11:04.464 --> 11:06.564
- So how do we get back?

11:06.566 --> 11:07.866
- It should be a problem.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.901
We have enough time
crystals to get home.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.170
Let's take a look around
before we leave.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.271
Hang out for ten minutes.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.241
- Bad idea.
We've gotta get back.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.877
- Wow, look at that!

11:23.884 --> 11:26.351
- Oh, my head is killing me.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.554
Rocksteady,
where the heck are we?

11:29.556 --> 11:32.524
- I think we are in the jersey?

11:49.676 --> 11:52.343
- Okay, cool, we saw most of it.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.312
Now let's go home.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.647
- Aw, cute.

11:55.649 --> 12:00.618
They're like chickens
crossed with iguanas.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.523
- What a sweet,
friendly, spikey guy.

12:05.525 --> 12:08.059
Whoa! Oh!

12:08.061 --> 12:09.928
Ahhh! Help!

12:09.930 --> 12:11.963
He-e-e-e-lp!

12:17.204 --> 12:19.270
- Dino doo-doo?!

12:19.272 --> 12:21.539
Mikey!

12:24.111 --> 12:28.513
- Oh, that's... That's a good
little giant triceratops.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.483
Take the nice weird
plant thing. Go on.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.191
- That's all I've got,
little big friend.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.160
Uh, easy, easy now.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.695
Whoa! Ah!

12:43.697 --> 12:46.097
Ah! Ah!

12:46.099 --> 12:48.133
Oh, stop it! Stop it!

12:51.037 --> 12:53.605
Stop, little big guy!

13:03.350 --> 13:05.183
Stop!

13:05.185 --> 13:08.319
Ah!

13:08.321 --> 13:11.523
Ha.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.533
- You were right about this
place being dangerous, leo.

13:21.535 --> 13:23.735
Nice.

13:23.737 --> 13:25.670
- Hey, you little...

13:25.672 --> 13:27.272
Stop, thief!

13:31.077 --> 13:33.011
- Ah!

13:35.582 --> 13:38.049
Yeah!

13:40.053 --> 13:41.553
Ha!

13:41.555 --> 13:43.421
Gimme that!

13:43.423 --> 13:46.424
Get outta there!

13:56.469 --> 13:59.337
- You evil little iguana.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.141
- Outsmarted by a chickenosaur?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.213
- I don't believe
I heard you say that!

14:12.452 --> 14:16.521
- Aw, look at this one.
It's kinda cute.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.624
Whoa, and kinda bitey.

14:19.626 --> 14:20.725
Easy, fella.

14:20.727 --> 14:24.762
Wow, he's got
some sharp toenails.

14:24.764 --> 14:25.630
Look at those things.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.133
You need some toenail
clippers, don't you, buddy?

14:31.104 --> 14:36.074
Raptors!

14:41.414 --> 14:44.415
- Ah!
- Back off of me, man!

14:44.417 --> 14:47.285
We're gonna get eaten.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.154
Raptors are amongst the
smartest, most adaptive...

14:50.156 --> 14:51.256
- Not now, donny!

14:51.258 --> 14:53.558
We need a plan!

14:57.697 --> 14:58.563
- Yah!

14:58.565 --> 15:02.567
Aw, not the chuks, raptor!

15:05.171 --> 15:06.571
- Ha! Ha!

15:06.573 --> 15:11.276
Oh, man, there's
too many of 'em.

15:16.716 --> 15:21.452
Mikey, you're a... Genius.

15:21.454 --> 15:26.591
- Um, I don't think mikey
scared it off.

15:33.833 --> 15:36.668
- Now everyone take it easy.

15:36.670 --> 15:38.836
No sudden movements.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.738
T-rex has terrible eyesight.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.440
- Actually, that would
be a myth.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.841
Uh, they have better
visual acuity

15:43.843 --> 15:46.644
Than eagles and...
And... And hawks.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.879
- Okay, run!

16:03.797 --> 16:04.462
- Hm?

16:04.464 --> 16:07.398
- Do you have a plan "b"...
Or "c" or "d"...

16:07.400 --> 16:09.200
Or any plan with a letter?!

16:09.202 --> 16:12.704
- We can't stop a t-rex
with sticks and blades.

16:12.706 --> 16:13.738
- Well, we can run!

16:13.740 --> 16:17.508
I just said that! Run!

16:17.510 --> 16:18.676
- Keep turning, you guys!

16:18.678 --> 16:20.244
T-rexes are bad at turning!

16:24.718 --> 16:27.352
Clear the jaws!

16:27.354 --> 16:31.356
- Thanks, mikey.
- Like a turtle do.

16:40.266 --> 16:46.471
- shhh.
It'll never know we're in here.

17:12.832 --> 17:15.599
Raph!

17:22.842 --> 17:24.675
Put me down, ya ugly chicken!

17:24.676 --> 17:27.444
No! Sorry about that!

17:27.446 --> 17:29.614
No, I'm not.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.815
Yes, I am.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.351
You know what?
I don't... Ahhhh!

17:40.794 --> 17:43.795
Ah! I hate pre-history!

17:50.603 --> 17:54.739
- Get to the ship.
We've gotta save raph.

18:03.783 --> 18:07.351
- Everyone inside, pronto!
Step to it!

18:13.960 --> 18:16.727
- We made it! Whew.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.695
Later, rex!

18:17.697 --> 18:19.730
- All right, let's save raph.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.733
Uh, any idea where he could be?

18:22.735 --> 18:26.504
- Probably inside of that lizard
bird's stomach by now...

18:26.506 --> 18:30.741
Slowly being digested
into dino poop.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.010
- Can you be
any more disgusting?

18:33.012 --> 18:34.645
- Absolutely.

18:43.389 --> 18:46.390
Ah! Enough already!

18:50.063 --> 18:52.830
- Ah, gotcha now!

19:22.428 --> 19:24.929
- Whoa, whoa, easy, girl, easy.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.898
I can't stand
to see you suffer...

19:26.900 --> 19:28.699
Even if you were gonna eat me

19:28.701 --> 19:30.835
Or feed me to
your babies or whatever.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.970
Easy now.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.572
Don't bite me.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.474
It's okay.

19:36.476 --> 19:40.578
Here, I'll fix you up
with my med kit.

19:40.580 --> 19:44.649
That's right.
There you go.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.717
It's cool, see?

19:46.719 --> 19:49.453
There, good as new.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.883
- These new costumes
are tight, rocksteady.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.885
I didn't know you were this good

20:20.887 --> 20:22.453
At awesome crafts, dawg.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.121
- You be looking
totally hip, dude.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.624
Hip, waist, stomach...
All of it.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.626
- Thank you.

20:27.627 --> 20:29.627
So, how are we gonna
get outta here?

20:29.629 --> 20:31.629
We've gotta find those turtles.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.166
They'll know how to get...

20:35.168 --> 20:36.767
Uh-oh.

20:47.947 --> 20:52.049
Raph!

20:52.051 --> 20:53.184
You're okay!

20:53.186 --> 20:55.019
- Yeah, I'm okay,
little brother.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.221
Let's get outta this
crazy time zone.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.556
- See what happens.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.192
We were supposed to be
here for ten minutes...

21:01.194 --> 21:02.560
Ten minutes!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.128
- Leo's right.
Any more time here

21:04.130 --> 21:06.030
Could have macro cosmic
effects on the future.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.567
We step on the wrong lizard
and humanity ceases to exist...

21:09.569 --> 21:11.068
That kinda thing.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.970
- Wow, that's bad, dude.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.206
- So, let's get outta here.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.819
- Oh, great...
Another one?

21:33.893 --> 21:36.327
- Run through its legs!

21:43.803 --> 21:46.103
- Activate the turtlebot 5000!

21:46.105 --> 21:48.272
- Ooh, I wanna press the button!

22:00.753 --> 22:05.222
- Yes, this is awesome!

22:25.244 --> 22:30.114
We're almost out of power!

22:38.257 --> 22:41.692
- Okay, transform
and get us home, donny.

22:41.694 --> 22:43.994
Now!
- Um, guys...

22:43.996 --> 22:46.364
T-rex is about to eat us!

23:10.156 --> 23:11.889
- Aw, poor guy.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.124
He just wanted hugs.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.725
- He just wanted us
in his belly.

23:21.934 --> 23:25.102
- Oh, no, the fuel is gone.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.039
Oh, this is bad.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.841
Without that meteorite,

23:30.843 --> 23:33.177
We're basically
stuck here... forever.

23:33.179 --> 23:36.447
- So that means... No tv?
No video games?

23:36.449 --> 23:37.449
No pizza?!

23:45.057 --> 23:46.924
- Oh, my gosh, guys, look!

24:14.187 --> 24:15.853
- Triceraton base?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.455
All the way back
in the cretaceous?

24:17.457 --> 24:19.089
- Look at all of those soldiers.

24:19.091 --> 24:21.492
This is crazy.
What are the odds?

24:21.494 --> 24:22.460
- Dudes, look.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.962
They enslaved those
poor little dinosaurs.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.864
We've gotta do something.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.938
- All right, we go in...
Full ninja mode.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.173
See what the triceratons
are up to.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.509
- Be stealthy, my ninjas.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.528
- It's the time crystals.
- Shhh.

24:57.530 --> 24:59.997
- They're mining time crystals.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.031
- This is great!

25:01.033 --> 25:03.133
There's more than enough
to get us home.

25:03.135 --> 25:05.870
- So how are we gonna
get it, genius?

25:05.872 --> 25:08.138
- I've got this, dudes.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.214
Mikey!

25:24.891 --> 25:26.490
Whew!

25:26.492 --> 25:27.525
- Whew!

25:30.162 --> 25:31.128
- Again?

25:31.130 --> 25:33.898
You are dopier than that
dinosaur right there.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.400
- Alien intruders!

25:36.402 --> 25:38.269
- Turtles, attack!

25:39.305 --> 25:43.974
- Dudes, I think I'd rather be
fighting that t-rex again.

25:46.512 --> 25:48.279
- Let's move, boys!

25:48.281 --> 25:51.048
- Unleash the robo-raptors.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.587
- Run like you've
never run before.

26:04.163 --> 26:09.466
- Ah, faster!
Faster! Faster!

26:09.468 --> 26:12.202
Whoa!

26:13.339 --> 26:15.906
- We can't run.
We've gotta fight.

26:15.908 --> 26:17.107
Bring 'em down.

26:17.109 --> 26:19.310
Bring 'em do...

26:24.350 --> 26:28.519
Huh?

26:29.989 --> 26:31.488
- There are just too many.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.258
- Goodbye, cruel pizza.

26:45.471 --> 26:46.604
- Whoa.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.942
Now that goes in the top five

26:51.944 --> 26:55.679
Most awesome moments
in my life folder.

26:59.552 --> 27:03.487
- That'll hold
those strange aliens.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.389
- Who are you calling strange?

27:05.391 --> 27:08.392
You got a mirror handy?

27:10.963 --> 27:13.263
We is trapped here,
comrade bebop.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.199
What will we dos?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.067
- They deactivated my weapons,

27:17.069 --> 27:19.536
But they didn't
check my boot, son.

27:19.538 --> 27:20.704
Secret stealth pack, you dig?

27:20.706 --> 27:23.140
I got flash powder,
floss sticks,

27:23.142 --> 27:24.375
Breath mints, shurikens.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.243
- Ooh, I call shurikens.

27:26.245 --> 27:27.411
- No way, man.

27:27.413 --> 27:31.415
I think I can use
them to do this...

27:34.186 --> 27:36.120
See that?

27:36.122 --> 27:38.055
- Oh, das, das!

27:38.057 --> 27:39.690
You is man!

27:39.692 --> 27:43.027
- We're not outta this yet.
Come on, let's go.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.635
Oh...

27:51.637 --> 27:54.271
- Let's move, man!
Come on, let's go!

28:03.582 --> 28:06.350
What is this?

28:08.187 --> 28:13.457
Alien prisoners escaping?

28:13.459 --> 28:15.526
- That fizzled.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.630
- They're gonna
vaporize us, dawg.

28:19.632 --> 28:22.266
- I love you, bebop.
Hold me tight.

28:22.268 --> 28:26.370
- Lieutenant zorg, take the
mutants to my command center.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.138
- As you wish, general zera.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.140
- No, no, no, hold on, lady.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.275
Don't you know this guy?

28:31.277 --> 28:33.544
Look at him.
He's one of you, of course.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.145
He's a cousy wus.

28:35.147 --> 28:37.781
- Um, yah, we is cousins.

28:37.783 --> 28:41.385
We are same species
of... Um...

28:41.387 --> 28:43.620
Alien horn people.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.560
- Oh, man, trick no work.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.261
- Shhh, quiet down, dawg.

28:51.263 --> 28:52.863
They've got some
kinda plan cookin'.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.431
- The ore of time
will empower us

28:54.433 --> 28:58.569
In ways your pitiful minds
could never conceive.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.671
Our great race of triceratons

29:00.673 --> 29:02.906
Will reap any time
period we want.

29:02.908 --> 29:05.709
We can restore
our glorious empire

29:05.711 --> 29:08.712
And rule the galaxy!

29:08.714 --> 29:10.714
- That sounds great.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.216
- That sounds terrible.

29:12.218 --> 29:17.454
- We better come up with
plan soon, comrade bebop.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.796
- All right, let's go back
and get those time crystals.

29:25.798 --> 29:27.598
- Donny, if we're
going into battle,

29:27.600 --> 29:29.600
You're gonna need
a dinosaur, bro.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.735
- Nah, I'm cool
with no dinosaur.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.804
I have legs. I can walk.

29:33.806 --> 29:36.173
- I thought you loved dinosaurs.

29:36.175 --> 29:37.207
- Not anymore.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.242
Not enough to ride 'em.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.511
- What kind of dino would
be perfect for donny?

29:40.513 --> 29:43.947
- Probably one of those goofy
duckbill lookin' guys.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.618
Michelangelo:

29:59.532 --> 30:01.231
- This way! Into the cave!

30:13.779 --> 30:16.780
- There's no way out.
This is barely a cave.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.515
What have you done, mikey?

30:18.517 --> 30:21.518
- It's a two-part
plan, dawg.

30:23.689 --> 30:26.256
It's been confirmed.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.791
You really are an idiot.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.294
- Take it, donny.
Make peace.

30:30.296 --> 30:32.663
No animals in any time
period can resist

30:32.665 --> 30:36.667
Pepperoni, maple syrup,
and peppermint sprinkles.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.636
Trust me, donny.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.939
Look!

30:43.442 --> 30:47.678
- Go to him.
Peace, love and animals.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.279
- Well, nice knowin' ya, donny.

30:49.281 --> 30:51.815
Can I have the shell razor
and the stealth bike?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.819
- Here, t-rex, nice t-rex.

30:55.821 --> 30:58.455
Please don't eat me.

30:58.457 --> 31:00.424
Oh!

31:13.839 --> 31:19.309
- You've gotta be pullin'
my bo staff.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.549
- Go ahead, donny, climb on.

31:25.551 --> 31:27.651
- Ride a tyrannosaurus rex?

31:27.653 --> 31:30.320
- There!
The turtle warriors!

31:31.457 --> 31:33.857
No time to ride
like the present!

31:44.470 --> 31:48.405
- Woo!

31:48.407 --> 31:48.906
Nice rex.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.743
Now let's get that
meteorite and go home.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.444
- Woo!

31:54.446 --> 31:55.746
- Whoa. Whoa.

31:55.748 --> 31:57.547
We need to gear up first, dudes.

31:57.549 --> 32:01.652
You know, like one of those
montages in action movies.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.618
- We're ninjas!

32:58.944 --> 33:02.412
- Yah! Nah! Nah! Nah!

33:10.122 --> 33:12.990
Got any good
escape plan yet, comrade bebop?

33:12.992 --> 33:15.392
- We distract the guard
and then grab

33:15.394 --> 33:17.427
That key-looking
rock on his belt

33:17.429 --> 33:18.829
And then use their com-link

33:18.831 --> 33:20.831
To try to contact
the turtles' t-phones.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.866
- That sounds like a bad plan.

33:22.868 --> 33:25.802
You don't have a com signal
in this time period.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.972
- Beep, y'all! Beep! Beep!
Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!

33:28.974 --> 33:31.942
- General, take a look at this.

33:31.944 --> 33:34.978
- Hm... Zoom in.

33:36.148 --> 33:39.583
The turtles have domesticated
the dinosaurs?

33:39.585 --> 33:42.886
- That's right and they're
gonna kick your horns in.

33:42.888 --> 33:44.755
- Yah, and we help them.

33:44.757 --> 33:46.690
- What should we do,
general zera?

33:46.692 --> 33:49.860
- Round up the troops.
Protect the perimeter.

33:49.862 --> 33:53.130
Activate the robo-spinosaurus!

34:15.020 --> 34:18.155
- What the heck is that?

34:33.005 --> 34:36.639
- We're in a deep,
deep pile of dino poop.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.284
- Turtles and dinos, to battle!

34:48.286 --> 34:52.856
Yeah-ha!

35:04.169 --> 35:06.236
- Dinobunga!

35:09.007 --> 35:10.740
Okay, that's a problem.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.024
- Swoop, pteranodon!
Down!

35:47.346 --> 35:50.046
Yes!

35:50.048 --> 35:54.084
Yah!

35:59.191 --> 36:02.192
Yah!

36:40.832 --> 36:41.832
- The spinosaur is toast.

36:41.833 --> 36:47.237
Take down the triceratons!
- Go, ninjas, go!

36:52.978 --> 36:55.245
- Beat it, dino!

37:00.953 --> 37:03.386
- No! No! No!

37:06.792 --> 37:09.025
- Halt, everything!

37:09.394 --> 37:14.231
If you continue, we will destroy
your mutant friends.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.099
- They're not our friends.

37:16.101 --> 37:17.234
Wait.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.736
How did you two end
up back here?

37:19.738 --> 37:21.838
- Uh, is long story, comrade.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.206
- Free us and we'll
help you, dawgs.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.875
We'll be a distraction of food.

37:25.877 --> 37:29.012
- Surrender.
Drop your weapons.

37:29.014 --> 37:32.282
I will not warn you twice.

37:32.284 --> 37:36.453
- Are we really doing this...
For those two jerks?

37:38.857 --> 37:40.991
- So you accept defeat?

37:40.993 --> 37:42.025
- No!

37:42.027 --> 37:44.160
And neither do our dino friends.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.880
- Did it!

38:28.173 --> 38:33.076
- Destroy the turtles
and their dinosaur pets!

38:54.499 --> 38:57.367
- There's too many triceratons.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.235
We need a back-up plan.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.307
- Donny, what about
the robo-raptors?

39:04.309 --> 39:06.109
Can you reprogram them?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.111
- Let's see.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.527
I told you we'd help you!

39:24.529 --> 39:27.263
Ow!

39:27.265 --> 39:30.867
Yes!

39:36.875 --> 39:39.542
- Oh, that really hurt.

39:51.089 --> 39:53.423
- Retreat, triceratons!

39:53.425 --> 39:54.524
Retreat!

40:09.441 --> 40:11.174
- Yes, we are awesome!

40:11.176 --> 40:14.043
Are we not an incredible
team or what?

40:14.045 --> 40:14.611
Yes? Maybe?

40:14.613 --> 40:18.181
- Can you please giving us
the ride back to the future?

40:18.183 --> 40:19.449
Yes? Please?

40:19.451 --> 40:20.884
- We won't leave you here.

40:20.886 --> 40:23.920
But you've gotta promise
to turn over a new leaf.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.622
- Yo, check this out.

40:25.624 --> 40:28.558
Leaf, turn over!
Turn over, leaf!

40:28.560 --> 40:32.061
You'd better turn over!

40:32.063 --> 40:35.064
You see, man, it's that easy.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.666
Boom, we're like good guys.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.368
- Fine.
Make yourself useful.

40:38.370 --> 40:40.537
Grab that time stuff
so we can go home.

40:40.539 --> 40:43.506
- We are on it, comrade turtle.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.608
- I bet I can salvage parts

40:45.610 --> 40:48.211
From the robo-spinosaurus
to fix the ship.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.579
But the bigger challenge
is calculating

40:49.581 --> 40:52.449
The correct chronal position
to travel to the future.

40:52.451 --> 40:54.584
- Right. Can you maybe
just hurry?

41:00.392 --> 41:03.226
- Whew, well,
that wasn't such a chore.

41:03.228 --> 41:07.230
It only took three days
of non-stop work.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.099
- Finally. Let's go home.

41:14.105 --> 41:16.973
Goodbye, little big fella.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.941
- Here, take my last

41:17.943 --> 41:20.643
Chris bradford survival
crunch granola bar.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.346
Isn't it great?

41:28.220 --> 41:29.319
- Goodbye, rex.

41:29.321 --> 41:32.121
You are the best cretaceous
friend a turtle could have.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.991
- I bet that's a sentence
no one ever said before.

41:37.128 --> 41:39.262
- I'll miss you, maurice.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.197
I love you, man.

41:42.267 --> 41:44.334
I wish I could take you with us.

41:44.336 --> 41:48.238
- Seriously, you're making
me a little misty-eyed.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.139
Fly away, girl.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.648
- All right, team,
let's go home.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.682
Cool, donny?

41:59.684 --> 42:01.417
I mean, nothing bad's
gonna happen

42:01.419 --> 42:04.721
From this point on.
- Uh...

42:04.723 --> 42:05.723
- Right?

42:05.724 --> 42:08.024
- Well, according
to murphy's law...

42:08.026 --> 42:11.027
Um, why yes, leo,
smooth as silk.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.663
- I can't wait to relax
back in the lair,

42:13.665 --> 42:15.131
Play some video games...

42:15.133 --> 42:17.734
- Eat some pizza, watch some tv.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.335
- I hope this works.

42:19.337 --> 42:20.570
This isn't a time machine.

42:20.572 --> 42:23.039
I had to do some calculations
based on temporal...

42:23.041 --> 42:26.075
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's just go!

42:45.597 --> 42:48.197
- Did we... Make it?

42:52.470 --> 42:54.404
- Oh, charoopa.

42:59.044 --> 42:59.809
- Where the heck are we?

42:59.811 --> 43:02.612
- Oh, any place
better than dinosaur place.

43:02.614 --> 43:07.617
- Whoa, dudes, I think
we're on the moon.

43:07.619 --> 43:10.486
- No, mikey,
we're in new york...

43:10.488 --> 43:12.622
In the future?

43:12.624 --> 43:15.358
- You gotta be kidding me.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.500
- A giant statue of
shredder in the future

43:24.502 --> 43:25.735
Can't be a good thing.

43:25.737 --> 43:28.438
- So, how about
we check the place out?

43:28.440 --> 43:30.773
Just for ten minutes or so?

43:33.144 --> 43:36.112
Yah! Yah!

43:36.114 --> 43:38.514
- Not again.

43:38.516 --> 43:42.285
- We're the ninjas!
