00:18.753 --> 00:20.120
<i>The thing that astounded me</i>

00:20.153 --> 00:24.258
<i>when I first saw Aspen was
that we had so much room here.</i>

00:25.359 --> 00:27.261
<i>It was an individual utopia.</i>

00:28.161 --> 00:30.598
<i>You could dance to the music
of your own cash register</i>

00:30.632 --> 00:32.567
<i>and then go off to a concert</i>

00:32.600 --> 00:35.369
<i>while your daughter
sat on a rock in the river,</i>

00:35.402 --> 00:37.471
<i>listening to a famous
painter talk about art.</i>

00:37.672 --> 00:38.907
<i>It's a lifestyle,
it's freedom.</i>

00:38.940 --> 00:41.475
<i>It's freedom of expression,
freedom of thought,</i>

00:41.676 --> 00:43.511
that we're really
fighting for.

00:47.147 --> 00:48.181
<i>By the end of the '60s,</i>

00:48.215 --> 00:50.317
<i>Aspen had become
a corporate utopia,</i>

00:51.285 --> 00:52.754
<i>a valley of the idle rich.</i>

00:53.821 --> 00:55.055
<i>As the new money poured in,</i>

00:55.088 --> 00:57.692
<i>they didn't want dirty hippies
moving into Aspen</i>

00:57.725 --> 01:00.528
<i>and frightening away
the big spenders.</i>

01:02.129 --> 01:03.765
They are raiding our forest.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.700
<i>They're living like animals.</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:08.770
Mescaline, marijuana,
my good God,

01:08.803 --> 01:10.772
this isn't the way of
American life.

01:10.805 --> 01:13.373
These freaks
will be thrown in jail.

01:13.407 --> 01:16.744
They add nothing to
the Valley and take much.

01:17.344 --> 01:18.478
<i>It's in
the greed heads' interest</i>

01:18.513 --> 01:20.848
<i>to grind up the Valley
and sell it for gravel.</i>

01:22.349 --> 01:24.686
<i>But it's not in my interest.</i>

01:32.760 --> 01:35.295
<i>I'd come to Aspen to
escape politics,</i>

01:35.663 --> 01:38.098
<i>but the bastards had
gone too far.</i>

01:38.465 --> 01:40.568
<i>And so we decided to do
something about it.</i>

01:42.637 --> 01:44.872
<i>The next sheriff of
Pitkin County!</i>

01:51.411 --> 01:54.247
Quiet everybody, quiet.
The results are coming in.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.750
Precinct one, Ricks.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.585
<i>None of us had even
a beginner's knowledge</i>

01:57.619 --> 01:59.486
<i>of how to run
a political campaign.</i>

02:00.487 --> 02:03.323
<i>We were like a bunch of
wild-eyed amateur mechanics,</i>

02:03.357 --> 02:04.726
<i>rolling a homemade racing car</i>

02:04.759 --> 02:06.561
<i>onto the track
in Indianapolis.</i>

02:07.260 --> 02:08.795
Hunter, 182.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.701
We just won the DMS, man!

02:15.469 --> 02:16.571
<i>How did I feel?</i>

02:17.972 --> 02:20.240
<i>Like a man who had started
some kind of bloody gang fight</i>

02:20.273 --> 02:21.274
<i>by accident.</i>

02:22.577 --> 02:26.446
<i>But when the going gets weird,
the weird turn pro.</i>

03:15.697 --> 03:18.398
My fellow Americans
share with me today

03:18.432 --> 03:20.768
the majesty of this moment.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.682
<i>They kept saying,
"Break it up, break it up,</i>

03:34.716 --> 03:35.883
<i>go back to your dorms."</i>

03:35.917 --> 03:38.418
And then they all started
marching or walking towards us

03:38.452 --> 03:39.687
with their bayonets

03:39.721 --> 03:41.455
<i>and from there it
was just chaos.</i>

03:41.488 --> 03:44.959
<i>The guard panicked and
fired its weapons indiscriminately,</i>

03:44.992 --> 03:45.993
<i>killing four people.</i>

04:06.413 --> 04:08.649
<i>Lord, we thank you
for this fish</i>

04:08.683 --> 04:10.718
and this bounty that we are
about to receive.

04:10.752 --> 04:15.322
And, er, Juan and Hunter
for catching the fish.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.156
Mm-hmm.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.926
- Good job, Juan.
- Good job, Juan.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.962
- Did you have fun?
- We had fun.

04:20.995 --> 04:22.429
We saw some raccoons.

04:23.064 --> 04:24.264
What else did we see?

04:24.464 --> 04:25.666
- Deer.
- Deer.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.969
Too bad we didn't have our gun
when we were fishing, right?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.604
What would we have done
to those deer?

04:29.637 --> 04:32.006
- Kill them.
- Yeah.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.307
But I don't want
deer to die.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.310
They're meat,
but they're animals too.

04:37.477 --> 04:40.480
- Mm-hm.
- There're humans that's up in their habitat.

04:40.882 --> 04:43.084
I don't understand your logic.
Continue.

04:43.117 --> 04:47.420
They're humans to them,
we're deer to them.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.023
That is a good point.
I like it.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.323
I don't want to kill a nature.

04:50.357 --> 04:53.293
Yeah but you will because
otherwise you'll starve to death.

04:53.728 --> 04:56.329
And then I'll bury you
out there in the woods.

04:57.632 --> 04:59.901
Can we go back to
Frances-cisco?

05:01.869 --> 05:05.438
Juan, this is the most
important piece of advice

05:05.472 --> 05:06.841
I'm ever going to give you.
Okay?

05:06.874 --> 05:08.776
You looking at me?
Right there? In the eyes?

05:09.544 --> 05:11.378
Never move to a big city.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.682
They won't let you take a shit
in your own backyard.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.384
Juan uses the potty, right?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.953
Yeah. I shit in the potty.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.124
Juan with a zinger!

05:37.839 --> 05:41.609
"Lax narrative structure needs
more personal involvement."

05:42.510 --> 05:45.012
I guess they want me to become
a goddam parody of myself.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.783
- Are you okay? What happened?
- I just threw up.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.552
Well, I pulled out
every single time.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.421
It must be the fish.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.090
The fish look good,
physically.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.424
Shut up.

05:57.457 --> 05:59.026
I'm going to go down there
tomorrow and

06:01.696 --> 06:03.496
do an investigation.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.071
<i>Somewhere in
the nightmare of failure</i>

06:44.105 --> 06:45.506
<i>that is gripping America,</i>

06:46.140 --> 06:47.341
<i>the notion of
beating the system</i>

06:47.375 --> 06:51.012
<i>by fighting it gave way to
the numb conviction</i>

06:51.212 --> 06:55.182
<i>that it made more sense in the
long run to flee or to hide</i>

06:55.917 --> 06:57.151
<i>than to fight the bastards</i>

06:57.184 --> 07:00.855
<i>on anything vaguely
resembling their own terms.</i>

07:03.891 --> 07:05.226
<i>We're turning into a nation</i>

07:05.259 --> 07:07.595
<i>of whimpering slaves to fear.</i>

07:08.062 --> 07:09.964
<i>Fear of war, fear of poverty,</i>

07:09.997 --> 07:12.033
<i>and fear of random terrorism.</i>

07:13.067 --> 07:14.735
<i>Fear of getting downsized</i>

07:14.769 --> 07:17.672
<i>or fired because of
the plunging economy.</i>

07:18.739 --> 07:20.641
<i>Fear of getting evicted
for bad debts</i>

07:20.675 --> 07:23.945
<i>or suddenly getting locked up
in a military detention camp</i>

07:24.145 --> 07:27.014
<i>on vague charges of
being a sympathizer.</i>

07:32.186 --> 07:35.523
Hey! Your cows are fucking
shitting all over my property!

07:35.556 --> 07:36.657
Eating my lettuce!

07:36.891 --> 07:37.892
It's open range!

07:39.093 --> 07:40.861
- Open range?
- Wanna keep my cows off of your lawn,

07:40.895 --> 07:42.563
- then build a fence!
- Hey!

07:45.132 --> 07:48.169
You hear me? Yeah!

07:56.644 --> 07:58.212
What will our tourists say

07:58.646 --> 08:00.815
when they hear it
in the news about Aspen?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.917
<i>This city has
gained the reputation of being</i>

08:02.950 --> 08:04.218
<i>the hippie capital
of the world.</i>

08:04.251 --> 08:06.754
<i>The smell of marijuana
on our street corners,</i>

08:07.588 --> 08:10.124
exhibitionists running
around our golf course naked,

08:10.157 --> 08:13.027
LSD dealers lurking
behind our schools.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.595
I'll tell you what
they're going to say.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.764
"Next year, we're going to
Vail."

08:17.031 --> 08:18.833
<i>Next time you come to Vail,</i>

08:18.866 --> 08:20.835
<i>you will find new lifts
and new courses,</i>

08:21.168 --> 08:22.970
<i>but the same friendly skiers.</i>

08:23.838 --> 08:26.774
So I don't think the hippies
are bad people

08:26.974 --> 08:28.943
but they are bad for business.

08:29.577 --> 08:30.878
I'm sorry, I have a question.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.981
Do you think of Aspen as a town
or as a commodity?

08:34.315 --> 08:36.616
If you're trying to
make me feel guilty

08:36.884 --> 08:38.753
for promoting
our beautiful town,

08:39.352 --> 08:40.821
it's not going to happen.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.592
It is moral and legal to
sell a good product

08:44.892 --> 08:46.727
and we've got
a good product here, folks.

08:46.761 --> 08:48.562
I don't think the reason that
any of us moved here

08:48.596 --> 08:50.131
was to increase the town's GDP.

08:50.164 --> 08:52.266
Okay. Thank you.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.003
Now I'm very interested to hear
what our sheriff has cooked up

08:56.037 --> 08:58.906
to keep the freeloaders from
setting up shop in this town

08:58.939 --> 09:01.809
and we will all be judging him

09:02.143 --> 09:03.210
come election day.

09:03.878 --> 09:06.080
We don't want a repeat of
the summer of love do we?

09:06.247 --> 09:08.582
I don't understand.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.617
Please, please, hey!

09:10.818 --> 09:12.686
How are we supposed to judge him
if he's running unopposed?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.089
That's the last question
I'll take from <i>Aspen Times</i>.

09:15.122 --> 09:17.158
Sheriff, take it away.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.032
With additional resources,
the help of my wife, and...

09:25.633 --> 09:27.268
some chalk from my kids,

09:27.301 --> 09:31.105
I was able to put together
the map you see in front of you.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.909
It shows illegal campgrounds,

09:35.209 --> 09:38.879
tenement-style apartments located
here, here, here, and there.

09:39.246 --> 09:43.284
There are exactly 844 known
transients in Pitkin County

09:43.784 --> 09:45.586
and all but 50 are jobless.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.158
And of course,
The Jerome Hotel.

09:51.192 --> 09:53.160
Everybody knows that's where
they're congregating.

09:53.194 --> 09:54.628
Most of the problem's...

09:54.795 --> 09:55.796
Right here.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.046
We're getting soft, sheriff.

10:13.247 --> 10:14.915
We're not tough like
we used to be.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.952
They're coming into our bars
asking for free drinks,

10:18.152 --> 10:19.987
contributing nothing to society.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.323
I told them we don't serve
long hairs in here.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.059
- Wrap it up, Ricks.
- So I took out old Hickory here

10:25.326 --> 10:28.162
- and I gave him a two-handed...
- Okay. Sheriff...

10:28.429 --> 10:29.697
Put it back, wrap it up.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.300
That's enough, Undersheriff Ricks.
Folks, I'm sorry about that.

10:33.334 --> 10:35.169
Um... what is that smell?

10:35.202 --> 10:39.907
Ladies and gentlemen,
I submit this slag as evidence

10:40.274 --> 10:43.811
that Pitkin Mining Corporation
is sodomizing our river.

10:44.211 --> 10:47.348
And I'd like to know what our local
government is gonna do about it.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.150
Sheriff, please.

10:49.183 --> 10:51.085
- This is not on the agenda.
- Right. The agenda.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.920
You need to submit it
three weeks ahead of time

10:52.953 --> 10:54.288
- so we can review it.
- Right.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.290
Mine Co. is not
breaking the law.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.093
Well, they're certainly
violating some type of statute.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.162
I mean go up there and
tick around, do your job.

11:01.195 --> 11:03.197
- That's not really what a sheriff does.
- Why not?

11:03.998 --> 11:05.766
Well, we have a strict purview.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.769
- Okay, this is not on the agenda.
- Strict purview. Purview.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.271
- Sheriff, please.
- Purview.

11:10.304 --> 11:12.072
Mr. Thompson, I'm going to
have to ask you leave.

11:12.106 --> 11:13.307
Look, from your
purview, you mean.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.043
I don't need to go anywhere.
I'm here at a town hall forum

11:16.076 --> 11:18.045
- exhibiting my rights...
- Undersheriff Ricks,

11:18.078 --> 11:19.581
show this man out.

11:19.614 --> 11:21.682
Oh, you're going to come here
and get this, okay come and get it.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.083
Seriously?

11:24.852 --> 11:27.154
I'll show you runs
this fucking town, Thompson.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.357
If you're not okay with it
being dumped here,

11:30.391 --> 11:33.093
you shouldn't be okay with it
being dumped in the fucking river!

11:33.327 --> 11:36.397
You pig.

11:42.937 --> 11:46.407
Burl, loitering, 30 dollar fine,
30 days in jail.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.409
Man, if I knew I was
blocking the sidewalk,

11:48.442 --> 11:50.811
- I wouldn't've been standing there.
- What'll it be?

11:51.345 --> 11:52.947
I don't have 30 dollars.

11:53.214 --> 11:54.348
Jail it is, Burl.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.483
Del Mar, noise complaint.

11:57.051 --> 11:58.852
30 dollar fine, 30 days in jail.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.921
I was just playing the fiddle.

12:00.955 --> 12:05.226
Very noisily.
That's jail, Del Mar.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.462
Thompson, you made bail.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.899
Oh, yeah.
Right. Peace joker.

12:11.932 --> 12:12.866
Hey, be free.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.202
You know I pay
your goddam salary, Whitmire.

12:15.236 --> 12:17.771
It doesn't get dropped in
your mailbox by a stork.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.007
Well, I don't make the laws,
I just enforce them.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.176
Yeah, that worked real well
at Nuremberg.

12:22.343 --> 12:23.777
- All right, Thompson.
- Hey, man,

12:23.811 --> 12:27.081
your badge is a shield because you're
supposed to shield us from harm.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.482
All right, Thompson.

12:29.817 --> 12:32.419
So did I make
the front page headlines?

12:32.453 --> 12:35.856
Yeah, here's the lead.
"Hunter Thompson,

12:35.889 --> 12:38.892
people's champion,
ruins janitor's day."

12:38.926 --> 12:41.795
How about, "Today's pig is
tomorrow's bacon."

12:53.474 --> 12:57.845
Peggy, those swine
are running a racket in there.

12:58.312 --> 13:01.282
Yeah. You got so caught up
in national politics

13:01.315 --> 13:03.317
you forgot it's the local stuff
that actually socks you.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.419
I mean, you should've seen
the freaks in that place.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.188
You know, locked up
for absolute bullshit.

13:08.556 --> 13:12.159
Fuckin' playing a fiddle in
public, blocking the sidewalk,

13:12.192 --> 13:14.328
or speaking one's mine at
a town hall meeting.

13:14.562 --> 13:17.331
Yeah. Speaking of that town
hall, if there really are

13:17.364 --> 13:20.200
844 of those freaks
hanging around Aspen,

13:20.234 --> 13:21.569
we might as well
put them to use.

13:21.603 --> 13:25.205
No one's ever needed more than 700
to win an election around here.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.509
You have enough to start
a third party on your hands.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.410
But those freaks can't vote,
they're drifters.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.546
Mm. Colorado law.

13:31.579 --> 13:33.515
Only have to have
lived here for 30 days.

13:34.616 --> 13:35.949
Huh.

13:37.619 --> 13:39.219
This town needs an animal.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.056
- Oh, no, hey now...
- Whoa.

13:42.289 --> 13:45.059
Benton, you look like you
could use an anchor rope.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.361
Oh, I have plenty of
anchor rope my friend.

13:47.562 --> 13:49.496
- Give that a try.
- Thank you very much.

13:49.531 --> 13:51.298
Yes, sir.
Good to see ya, Hunter.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.203
This is fucking awful grass,
man.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.405
What you're tasting, Hunter,
is a little pipe tobacco,

13:58.439 --> 14:01.141
pure pipe tobacco that
I soaked in some PCP.

14:01.175 --> 14:03.177
- So don't worry about it, don't worry.
- Oh, my God, man.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.478
- Don't waste it, don't waste it!
- I'm fucking...

14:04.512 --> 14:07.381
just go out of jail, I'm really
not trying to trip right now.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.183
Well, you know,
if you just got out of jail...

14:09.216 --> 14:10.518
- Here, one more.
- Come by the studio,

14:10.552 --> 14:12.319
you're hanging out with the pigs...

14:12.353 --> 14:14.288
Come on man. Don't hog it.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.389
Okay.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.268
And two packs of
Dunhill, please.

14:29.604 --> 14:31.338
So will you
be paying cash?

14:31.606 --> 14:34.341
No, just put it on my,
um, account.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.510
As per usual.

14:36.377 --> 14:38.513
Hunter, I'm sorry.
Come on.

14:41.281 --> 14:46.286
All right, well then give me the
bag of and the tampon.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.123
Thanks.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.024
What are you doing
playing around with that thing?

14:51.325 --> 14:52.459
I'm a filmmaker.

14:52.493 --> 14:54.328
If you're a filmmaker,
what are you doing

14:54.361 --> 14:55.896
working at the grocery store?

14:56.430 --> 14:57.898
Young Ed Wood?

15:08.375 --> 15:12.680
<i>Exactly
844 known transients in Pitkin County.</i>

15:12.714 --> 15:14.481
<i>...to win
an election around here.</i>

15:14.516 --> 15:16.551
<i>You have enough
to start a third party.</i>

15:18.185 --> 15:20.020
<i>I could be Muhammad Ali.</i>

15:21.689 --> 15:23.457
I could be Muhammad Ali.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.126
I could be Muhammad Ali.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.328
I could be Muhammad Ali.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.265
I could be Muhammad Ali.

15:31.599 --> 15:33.233
I could be Muhammad Ali.

15:33.635 --> 15:35.737
You can get it,
you motherfucker!

15:35.770 --> 15:38.640
- I know we can.
- Hunter, Hunter, stop. Where have you been?

15:38.673 --> 15:40.140
I was in jail.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.411
You've been in jail?
Why didn't you call me?

15:44.445 --> 15:46.614
They didn't even give me
a phone call.

15:46.648 --> 15:49.617
This Whitmire motherfucker,
Undersheriff,

15:49.651 --> 15:52.554
Dig Nicholas, the whole works.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.456
- Fucked me hard.
- You're fucked up.

15:56.658 --> 15:58.425
I have news, good news.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.128
<i>Rolling Stone</i> called.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.263
What did they say?

16:04.398 --> 16:05.633
There's a plane ticket waiting
for you at the airport.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.502
You're going to San Francisco.

16:08.603 --> 16:11.138
I don't want to go to
San Fran... cisco.

16:11.673 --> 16:13.575
I want to focus on my book

16:14.475 --> 16:17.712
and I'm gonna just stay here
and work on the book.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.048
You're going to San Francisco.

16:21.816 --> 16:24.017
If you don't, Juan and I are.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.420
You and Juan
are going to San Francisco?

16:26.453 --> 16:28.422
- Oh, yeah.
- You look like you're bluffing.

16:31.559 --> 16:32.594
You're going.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.127
Of course I am.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.733
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hunter, thanks for coming out.

17:11.766 --> 17:14.201
- Jann. John.
- It's pronounced "Yann,"

17:14.233 --> 17:15.368
pretty sure you already
knew that.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.304
My son, his name is Juan.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.107
- Nice to meet you, Han.
- Sit down, man, uh...

17:20.140 --> 17:21.809
How's it going?
Thanks for bringing me out.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.310
I just read the Derby piece.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.246
Love this subjective,
first person,

17:26.280 --> 17:28.550
crazy travelog thing
you got going on.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.785
- Yeah? You like it.
- What else you been working on?

17:30.818 --> 17:32.654
The last two years...

17:34.154 --> 17:36.558
working on this death of
the American Dream book

17:37.491 --> 17:40.127
and chasing the story,

17:40.160 --> 17:41.529
2,000 pages deep,

17:42.797 --> 17:44.097
I'm in Chicago

17:46.133 --> 17:48.268
and those fucking cops,
they beat the shit out of me so bad,

17:48.302 --> 17:51.639
gave me such a goddamn concussion that
my doctor tells me I can't work on

17:51.673 --> 17:53.373
any more long form journalism.

17:53.708 --> 17:55.375
So I'm writing articles.

17:55.577 --> 17:56.778
Long form, short form.

17:56.811 --> 17:59.313
You can write 500 words.
You can write 5,000.

17:59.346 --> 18:01.114
Just, uh, give me a pitch.

18:01.148 --> 18:02.517
What does Hunter Thompson
want to write?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.519
I got your pitch.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.254
Why mess with a proven formula?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.189
You could send me
across the country,

18:09.222 --> 18:11.391
spitting venomous
bullshit at all things

18:11.425 --> 18:13.126
that people love and respect.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.429
And I could go to
the Super Bowl, Mardi Gras,

18:15.462 --> 18:17.532
St. Patrick's Day parade,
America's Cup,

18:17.565 --> 18:20.133
the DNC convention,
maybe even Vegas.

18:20.668 --> 18:22.302
The only thing I can guarantee

18:23.170 --> 18:25.105
is that I'll come back with
fear and loathing.

18:26.541 --> 18:28.676
Well um, we're not really
in the business of

18:28.943 --> 18:31.579
sending writers out fishing
with massive expense tabs

18:31.613 --> 18:32.780
hoping they'll catch a story,
you know?

18:32.814 --> 18:34.015
- Yeah?
- We just can't afford it.

18:34.048 --> 18:37.885
But if we can narrow it down
a bit to something specific...

18:38.653 --> 18:41.789
Well... um...

18:42.322 --> 18:43.691
So you're not into those ideas.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.225
I mean, look.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.530
What about... the weird mechanics
of a hostile takeover bid

18:49.564 --> 18:50.565
of a small town?

18:51.699 --> 18:52.800
What's your angle?

18:52.834 --> 18:54.769
My angle is that
you're looking at

18:54.802 --> 18:57.705
the next Sheriff of
Pitkin County, Colorado.

18:57.739 --> 18:59.272
Oh, well who's going to
vote for you?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.708
Who isn't going to vote for me?

19:00.742 --> 19:02.577
All of your people are
going to vote for me.

19:02.610 --> 19:05.412
The weirdos, the wobblys,
the hippies, the heads,

19:05.445 --> 19:07.682
the bikers, pot heads,
progressives.

19:07.715 --> 19:09.182
Most of all, the freaks.

19:09.517 --> 19:11.886
- The freaks?
- You should see the freaks.

19:11.919 --> 19:13.921
They're everywhere
and they can vote.

19:13.955 --> 19:15.222
People forget that.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.794
500 bucks for 5,000 words.

19:19.994 --> 19:21.194
Deal.

19:34.441 --> 19:38.445
This could change everything. No more
rejection letters, and no more spec articles.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.515
I could become
a full-time columnist.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.387
It's a good idea.

19:49.289 --> 19:50.390
You were right, Sandy.

19:52.694 --> 19:53.761
You were right.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.738
How much does the Sheriff make?

20:04.939 --> 20:07.742
8,000 dollars a year.

20:08.976 --> 20:12.245
Okay, so you'd still get
to write things,

20:12.980 --> 20:15.348
- like parking tickets.
- Oh!

20:15.650 --> 20:16.884
My wife.

20:16.918 --> 20:18.586
My wife with the knife.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.318
Power is our priority.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.887
These swine must be broken,

20:52.920 --> 20:55.455
fucked and driven from the land.

20:55.723 --> 20:57.290
All right, so what's the plan,
Hunter?

20:57.324 --> 20:59.459
We're gonna stop those
ski pants in their tracks.

20:59.761 --> 21:01.829
Well, what are we supposed to
do, man? The system's rigged.

21:01.863 --> 21:03.430
We don't vote because
there's nothing we can do.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.699
I mean, look what
happened to Kennedy.

21:04.732 --> 21:06.466
Peggy, wake up.

21:07.869 --> 21:09.369
I'm running for Sheriff.

21:09.904 --> 21:11.739
We are going to start
a third party.

21:12.840 --> 21:13.841
God, Hunter.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.010
- Sounds like fun.
- It sounds like a lot of work.

21:16.811 --> 21:18.445
You're at the bar
all day already.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.815
Hey, I'm here to bail out Joker

21:20.848 --> 21:22.016
and the rest of those freaks.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.529
You really want to
start a third party

21:34.562 --> 21:35.997
or do you just want to
start a party?

21:36.030 --> 21:38.633
I mean, it's going to be
really fun, but no,

21:38.666 --> 21:39.934
I'm dead fucking serious.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.736
I mean, the house has been
prime for the taking.

21:41.969 --> 21:43.671
It's a crazy plan, Hunter.

21:43.704 --> 21:45.338
It's not a crazy plan.

21:45.673 --> 21:46.674
Fuck you.

21:47.074 --> 21:48.075
Joker.

21:48.810 --> 21:49.777
Yeah, brother.

21:50.745 --> 21:52.345
All right, Hunter, what do
you need from me?

21:52.379 --> 21:53.648
I need you to make the posters.

21:53.681 --> 21:55.650
- Are you down?
- You're really sincere?

21:55.683 --> 21:56.851
I'm sincere.
Come on.

21:57.718 --> 21:58.820
Let's do it.

21:58.853 --> 22:00.721
All right. If you're serious,
I'm in.

22:00.755 --> 22:02.489
- You know I'm in.
- Good.

22:02.757 --> 22:04.859
Propaganda.
I'm in.

22:13.100 --> 22:16.037
<i>Time to unite
the freak kingdom.</i>

22:17.638 --> 22:19.472
All the decisions we make
should be recorded

22:19.507 --> 22:20.875
and available
in the public library

22:20.908 --> 22:22.910
for anybody to listen to.
No backroom dealing.

22:22.944 --> 22:26.047
Mike has generously
offered the bar

22:26.080 --> 22:27.615
as our campaign headquarters.

22:27.648 --> 22:29.449
And as well as using the bar
for the campaign,

22:29.482 --> 22:30.852
we'll do a Freak Power
Happy Hour.

22:30.885 --> 22:32.086
- Freak Power Happy Hour?
- Yeah.

22:32.119 --> 22:33.521
Yeah, and we'll take
10 percent of that

22:33.554 --> 22:34.722
and throw it into the war chest.

22:34.755 --> 22:36.489
- Why do we need money?
- Airtime.

22:36.757 --> 22:37.992
I think we can run
this campaign for free.

22:38.025 --> 22:40.460
- I think that's the revolution.
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.564
We need to run propaganda
that will make the fatbacks

22:43.598 --> 22:46.167
fear waking up every morning
and putting on their radio.

22:46.200 --> 22:47.768
- Aye, aye.
- Yes.

22:47.802 --> 22:49.971
And while we're on the subject
of flogging the noggins,

22:50.137 --> 22:52.106
when I imagine
your campaign poster

22:52.139 --> 22:54.575
I see this giant cyclops owl

22:54.609 --> 22:57.979
with drips coming
out of its face and talons.

22:58.012 --> 22:59.513
You know, I had a dream
the other night

22:59.780 --> 23:02.884
and I pictured a giant
two-thumbed red fist

23:02.917 --> 23:04.752
clenching a peyote button.

23:04.986 --> 23:06.954
- Ooh.
- Okay. All right.

23:06.988 --> 23:09.924
We have two weeks left until
registration closes.

23:09.957 --> 23:12.059
We need all 844 of our people

23:12.093 --> 23:13.694
to be registered
by October second,

23:13.728 --> 23:14.595
and that's not even
the hard part.

23:14.629 --> 23:16.463
Then we need to get them
to stick around

23:16.496 --> 23:17.565
until November to vote.

23:18.699 --> 23:20.968
And this is the location of all
the freaks in town.

23:21.002 --> 23:22.703
We don't need anyone to
clean up to vote.

23:22.737 --> 23:24.972
They can vote dirty or naked as
long as they turn up.

23:25.239 --> 23:29.476
And do it quietly. We don't want to
scare the boujees into a counter attack.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.444
What are you, in high school?

23:31.478 --> 23:33.047
You can't even vote
until you're 21.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.447
Yeah, but maybe if Hunter wins,

23:34.481 --> 23:35.883
he can get me out of
going to Vietnam.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.954
That's right, Young Wood. Worst case
scenario, I will drive you to Canada.

23:42.857 --> 23:44.491
<i>One of the main
things I've learned out here</i>

23:44.525 --> 23:47.695
<i>is that there are all kinds of
very able people wandering around</i>

23:47.728 --> 23:49.563
<i>with no place to use
their energy.</i>

23:50.932 --> 23:52.934
<i>If we can put this unused
energy to work,</i>

23:53.500 --> 23:55.770
<i>we'll have a hell
of a tool on our hands.</i>

23:57.772 --> 24:00.908
<i>Our movement was
a strange combination</i>

24:00.942 --> 24:03.978
<i>of Woodstock vibrations,
new left activism,</i>

24:04.011 --> 24:06.914
<i>and basic
Jeffersonian democracy</i>

24:07.114 --> 24:10.584
<i>with strong echoes of
the Boston Tea Party ethic.</i>

24:10.818 --> 24:12.820
Three words,
Hunter S. Thompson.

24:12.853 --> 24:14.255
I was wondering
if I could talk to you

24:14.288 --> 24:16.991
about Hunter Thompson's run
for Sheriff of Aspen?

24:17.024 --> 24:18.592
I'm Hunter S. Thompson
and I'm running for Sheriff.

24:18.626 --> 24:20.561
Are you guys interested in
registering to vote?

24:20.594 --> 24:22.530
This blue line represents
the Democratic voters.

24:22.563 --> 24:24.865
We've got 920 of those
registered in Pitkin County

24:24.899 --> 24:27.467
and then 1,102 Republicans.

24:27.768 --> 24:30.171
And as of right now
the Independents

24:30.204 --> 24:32.606
are all the way down
here in the 700s.

24:32.807 --> 24:35.042
These Democrats, man,
they're DOA, okay?

24:35.076 --> 24:36.277
Two party system's out.

24:36.310 --> 24:37.778
Are you guys gonna
register to vote?

24:37.812 --> 24:38.779
I don't know, man.

24:38.813 --> 24:41.115
Voting's just one of those
things that, like,

24:41.816 --> 24:44.118
not everybody does, you know
what I'm sayin'?

24:44.151 --> 24:46.921
So we're starting a new party.
Are you interested in registering to vote?

24:47.621 --> 24:49.757
- No? I'm running for Sheriff.
- No.

24:49.790 --> 24:52.059
- No, not really into it.
- No? You don't want to register?

24:52.093 --> 24:53.761
- Not really.
- No, sorry.

24:53.794 --> 24:54.996
I'm just here for the party.

24:55.029 --> 24:57.531
Really? All right.
Be a fuckin' slave then.

24:58.265 --> 25:00.835
<i>Aspen is full of
freaks and weird night people</i>

25:00.868 --> 25:03.004
<i>of every description,
but most of them</i>

25:03.037 --> 25:05.706
<i>would prefer jail or
the bastinado</i>

25:05.906 --> 25:08.642
<i>to the horror of actually
registering to vote.</i>

25:08.676 --> 25:11.245
You got no power,
you're powerless.

25:11.278 --> 25:12.747
All right, keep goin'.

25:19.353 --> 25:21.288
- I got six.
- Oh, well,

25:21.322 --> 25:24.759
I got a grand total of four.

25:25.026 --> 25:26.694
We got 10 at the bar.

25:26.961 --> 25:30.598
I got six, which means an
average of one person an hour.

25:30.631 --> 25:33.834
I mean, what did we think? We were going to
wave a magic wand and get Hunter elected?

25:33.868 --> 25:36.570
We need to shock them out of
their political complacency.

25:36.604 --> 25:38.706
A savage and mind-bending campaign

25:38.739 --> 25:40.041
with no quarter given.

25:40.341 --> 25:43.878
Our posters must torture
the outer limits

25:43.911 --> 25:45.279
of political gall.

25:45.312 --> 25:47.748
Our platform so
massively unsuitable

25:47.782 --> 25:51.152
and yet perfectly sensible that
the good citizens of Aspen

25:51.185 --> 25:53.621
will try to rush us
out like lepers

25:54.021 --> 25:56.157
and the most apolitical
drug children

25:56.190 --> 25:58.125
of the most degenerate
outer communes

25:58.159 --> 26:02.630
will come rushing to our defense
saying I must vote.

26:02.663 --> 26:06.901
What we need, what we are is Freak Power.

26:06.934 --> 26:08.803
- Freak Power.
- Freak Power, man.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.906
I think that we should ride
this wave of votes

26:11.939 --> 26:13.741
that you're going to get to do

26:13.774 --> 26:15.876
some creative ballot measures
alongside, you know.

26:15.910 --> 26:18.112
Put an end to this highway
they keep talking about,

26:18.145 --> 26:20.981
or use zoning against
the greed heads for once.

26:21.015 --> 26:22.850
Like generally make it
harder to build

26:22.883 --> 26:24.385
a tar pit next to our river.

26:24.418 --> 26:25.520
You know what would
be really great

26:25.554 --> 26:28.956
is if we could come up with some
kind of ballot measure

26:28.989 --> 26:31.158
that actually got
the long-hairs to show up

26:31.192 --> 26:33.928
and actually pay attention to
that part of the ballot.

26:52.046 --> 26:55.082
<i>Tentative platform, 1970.</i>

26:55.916 --> 26:57.918
<i>We will sod the streets
at once.</i>

26:58.319 --> 27:01.122
<i>Rip up all city streets
with jackhammers</i>

27:01.155 --> 27:04.391
<i>and use the junk
asphalt after melting</i>

27:04.425 --> 27:07.328
<i>to create a huge parking and
auto storage lot</i>

27:07.828 --> 27:09.330
<i>on the outskirts of town.</i>

27:14.101 --> 27:16.203
<i>We will change the name Aspen</i>

27:16.237 --> 27:18.939
by public referendum
to Fat City.

27:21.742 --> 27:26.680
- What for?
- To prevent land rapers, greed heads and human jackals

27:27.181 --> 27:29.316
from capitalizing on
the name Aspen.

27:29.350 --> 27:31.218
Young Ed Wood over here will now

27:31.252 --> 27:33.187
be attending
Fat City High School.

27:33.988 --> 27:36.056
- Fat City Liquor.
- Ski Fat City?

27:36.090 --> 27:38.826
<i>Aspen, Colorado
would no longer exist,</i>

27:38.859 --> 27:41.162
<i>and the psychic
alterations of this change</i>

27:41.195 --> 27:43.297
<i>would be massive
in the world of commerce.</i>

27:43.330 --> 27:44.732
Ski Fat City.

27:46.934 --> 27:49.036
<i>Drug sales must be controlled.</i>

27:49.069 --> 27:51.906
<i>My first act as Sheriff
will be to install</i>

27:51.939 --> 27:55.309
<i>on the courthouse lawn,
a bastinado platform</i>

27:55.342 --> 27:57.945
<i>and a set of stocks
in order to punish</i>

27:57.978 --> 28:00.848
<i>dishonest dope dealers
in a proper public fashion.</i>

28:01.849 --> 28:03.951
Hunter Thompson's promising
affordable housing

28:03.984 --> 28:04.985
to all locals for life.

28:05.019 --> 28:07.721
He plans on banning
automobiles from downtown.

28:07.755 --> 28:09.723
Aren't you sick of being
harassed by the police?

28:09.757 --> 28:11.392
So do something about it. Vote.

28:11.425 --> 28:13.294
If you get caught with a doobie
twice in Colorado,

28:13.327 --> 28:15.029
they can give you
the death penalty right now.

28:15.062 --> 28:16.631
Cops should never be
armed in public.

28:16.665 --> 28:20.034
<i>By this approach,
making hundreds or even thousands</i>

28:20.067 --> 28:21.969
<i>of individuals
personally responsible</i>

28:22.002 --> 28:24.705
<i>for protecting the animals,
fish and birds who live here,</i>

28:24.872 --> 28:27.308
<i>we would create a sort of
de facto game preserve</i>

28:27.341 --> 28:29.777
<i>without the harsh restrictions</i>

28:29.810 --> 28:31.845
<i>that will necessarily
be forced on us</i>

28:31.879 --> 28:33.347
<i>if these blood thirsty geeks</i>

28:33.380 --> 28:35.149
<i>keep swarming
in here each autumn</i>

28:35.182 --> 28:37.885
<i>to shoot everything they see.</i>

28:37.918 --> 28:39.486
- So we can count on your vote?
- Yeah.

28:39.853 --> 28:41.288
Yeah. I'm... I'm voting
for Hunter.

28:41.322 --> 28:43.157
- I'll vote for Hunter.
- Sign us up.

28:43.190 --> 28:44.758
I'm voting for Hunter Thompson.

28:44.792 --> 28:46.293
- Fat City.
- Fat City.

28:46.827 --> 28:48.462
<i>Fat City!</i>

28:56.036 --> 28:57.304
Have you seen this?

28:57.338 --> 28:59.073
Um, yes, I have seen 'em.

28:59.106 --> 29:00.474
But I believe it's best
we just leave 'em alone.

29:00.508 --> 29:02.209
- He's more trouble than...
- Take it down, Carol.

29:02.243 --> 29:05.246
- ...he's worth. What?
- Every last poster, take it down.

29:05.279 --> 29:06.981
Mayor, what you're seeing
in front of you here

29:07.014 --> 29:09.049
- is the freedom of speech.
- All right, all right. Get out.

29:09.551 --> 29:11.352
- I can't hear it. Go.
- All right.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.022
Oh. This is a cross-section of
peyote in the center.

29:15.055 --> 29:17.024
- Get out, Carol.
- All right.

29:23.330 --> 29:24.965
Uh, lower.

29:25.199 --> 29:26.367
Keep goin'.

29:26.967 --> 29:28.202
What are you doing?

29:28.235 --> 29:30.904
Oh, 72 of our voters
were disqualified.

29:31.839 --> 29:34.975
- Did they tell you why?
- Some of them forgot to write their age.

29:35.009 --> 29:36.176
Some of them don't live here.

29:36.210 --> 29:38.212
Someone wrote their
name in as Teepee Bob?

29:38.245 --> 29:40.180
I don't think those are valid reasons.
Okay. Come with me.

29:40.214 --> 29:41.516
I think we should go
to the library.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.017
It's Freak Power Happy Hour.

29:43.217 --> 29:44.985
Yeah. We were just
gonna get drinks.

29:54.461 --> 29:56.130
Parker's squad is in
the library.

29:56.163 --> 29:57.431
Who cares?

29:57.464 --> 29:59.099
It's not their place.
Let's go get 'em.

30:01.603 --> 30:04.506
- Show me your hands. Hand up, eyes up.
- Hands!

30:04.539 --> 30:06.273
Oh, is that Thompson?

30:06.940 --> 30:09.076
- Peggy.
- Ooh, you got us, Ricks.

30:09.109 --> 30:10.944
This is a library for
Aspen residents,

30:10.978 --> 30:13.213
this is not a library for
transient journalists.

30:13.247 --> 30:14.616
You are the corniest man
I've ever met.

30:14.649 --> 30:17.217
You know you can't write, Thompson.
Peggy, what are you doing here?

30:17.251 --> 30:19.486
We're researching a story,
Ricks. You want the front page?

30:20.287 --> 30:22.389
Why are you hanging out with
Peggy so much, Thompson?

30:22.423 --> 30:25.092
- Whole towns wondering.
- She's my campaign manager.

30:25.125 --> 30:26.528
I mean, are you gonna
arrest us or what?

30:26.561 --> 30:28.530
Let me get back to fucking
reading and doing my job.

30:28.563 --> 30:29.830
If you're resisting, I will.

30:30.064 --> 30:31.899
Resisting?
Come on, man.

30:31.932 --> 30:34.368
Let us get back to work.
Stop wasting our time.

30:34.401 --> 30:37.071
Let's go deputy, 'cause
they're doing nothing wrong,

30:37.104 --> 30:40.207
but someday you will be
doing something wrong,

30:40.240 --> 30:43.177
and I will make a point of it.

30:43.210 --> 30:47.014
I am not fuckin' around.

30:47.948 --> 30:50.150
Are those uniforms even
government issued?

30:50.552 --> 30:51.919
Fuck you!

30:55.255 --> 30:57.858
If this is our competition,
I think...

30:58.959 --> 31:01.061
we can call it a night.

31:07.968 --> 31:11.905
<i>The system has a built
in wipe-down mechanism for</i>

31:11.939 --> 31:14.375
<i>dealing with unwanted
challengers,</i>

31:14.609 --> 31:18.379
<i>political and legal roadblocks
which deny innovation.</i>

31:19.113 --> 31:20.648
This person lives in a teepee.

31:20.682 --> 31:22.517
He lives in his gosh darn car.

31:22.550 --> 31:24.385
She just came back from
college to vote.

31:24.418 --> 31:25.419
He has no driver's license.

31:25.452 --> 31:28.155
He's a seasonal employee.
He's a ski instructor.

31:28.355 --> 31:30.324
They're just passing through.
They don't belong.

31:31.258 --> 31:33.661
<i>But our system of
government was in fact designed</i>

31:33.695 --> 31:37.297
<i>for change and it was time we
made us of that very design.</i>

31:38.132 --> 31:40.702
All in all we found 72
disqualified voters.

31:40.735 --> 31:42.403
Excuse me, wait. Excuse me.

31:42.436 --> 31:43.705
Sorry, nope.

31:43.738 --> 31:44.706
And I'll be recording.

31:44.739 --> 31:46.508
I'd like you to take
a look at this.

31:47.975 --> 31:49.143
Yeah, as you can see here.

31:49.176 --> 31:52.980
you don't need to establish
physical residency in Aspen

31:53.013 --> 31:55.416
nor do you need a valid ID.

31:56.116 --> 31:59.486
And then here it says
very clearly

31:59.521 --> 32:02.423
that any person
who files a frivolous claim

32:02.456 --> 32:04.358
against another
person's right to vote

32:04.391 --> 32:06.561
commits a misdemeanor
in the first degree.

32:07.762 --> 32:10.497
Sheriff Whitmire,
it seems as if you've just

32:10.532 --> 32:12.099
witnessed them commit, uh,

32:12.132 --> 32:15.537
10 first degree
misdemeanors apiece.

32:16.136 --> 32:19.973
Each of which carries a 30-dollar
fine or 30 days in jail.

32:20.007 --> 32:21.975
Fine.
You get what you want.

32:22.644 --> 32:25.613
You can keep the 72
voters on the rolls

32:25.647 --> 32:28.415
and we'll get on with
business as usual.

32:28.449 --> 32:30.284
No Eve, I can't let you do that.

32:30.685 --> 32:35.088
Folks, you will be arraigned
in two weeks from today

32:35.122 --> 32:37.592
in front of the city magistrate.
Is that understood?

32:37.625 --> 32:38.726
Okay, enough.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.562
I have stood by you
all these years

32:40.595 --> 32:44.231
and if you think I'm gonna
sit by and let you turn on me,

32:44.264 --> 32:47.067
- you've got another thing coming.
- This is bullshit, Carol.

32:47.100 --> 32:48.636
Just because it's law doesn't
mean that you have

32:48.670 --> 32:50.370
to follow it if it's stupid.

32:50.404 --> 32:52.607
You've seen these transients
come into our town.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.441
You've seen what they've
done to our youth.

32:54.475 --> 32:56.376
You are no longer fit
to be Sheriff,

32:56.410 --> 32:59.980
and that is why I will resign
and run against you.

33:00.815 --> 33:02.149
What?

33:03.751 --> 33:05.419
Everybody get out of my office.

33:05.452 --> 33:07.020
Now. Everybody out.

33:08.055 --> 33:09.056
Success.

33:09.657 --> 33:10.758
I got it all here.

33:18.533 --> 33:21.201
So we got our 72 votes back

33:21.235 --> 33:25.105
and contrary to a lifetime
of experiences,

33:26.106 --> 33:29.243
the law might actually
be on my side.

33:29.711 --> 33:31.311
It's not just the 72.

33:31.746 --> 33:33.046
It's not just the 72.

33:33.080 --> 33:34.582
Ricks is running
against Whitmire.

33:35.282 --> 33:37.552
Those idiots have split the
entire electorate.

33:39.621 --> 33:41.455
Barr any major fuck-ups,
a month from now

33:41.488 --> 33:43.156
we're gonna be running
the town of Aspen.

34:17.625 --> 34:18.826
Private property.

34:20.562 --> 34:21.663
Yeah.

34:21.696 --> 34:22.797
And don't come back!

34:23.429 --> 34:24.831
<i>The countdown is on us.</i>

34:25.264 --> 34:28.201
<i>I can feel it,
an iceberg of loose ends</i>

34:28.636 --> 34:31.405
<i>is about to flip over and
dump all these freaks</i>

34:31.438 --> 34:34.542
<i>out of hiding for a national
nervous breakdown</i>

34:34.909 --> 34:37.244
<i>with nothing sacred and
no-holds-barred</i>

34:37.277 --> 34:40.147
<i>and God's mercy on all those
left out in the open.</i>

34:44.819 --> 34:46.453
We're trying to get
together a list

34:46.485 --> 34:49.623
of endorsement for
Hunter Thompson for Sheriff

34:49.657 --> 34:51.358
and put it on the radio.

34:51.559 --> 34:52.760
Uh, would you be up for that?

34:53.928 --> 34:55.897
Hunter Thompson
is the only candidate

34:55.929 --> 34:58.298
who has the imagination
and intelligence

34:58.332 --> 35:00.568
to be a law
enforcement executive.

35:00.935 --> 35:02.604
Elect Hunter Thompson Sheriff.

35:02.904 --> 35:05.405
If you don't want that person
in our government.

35:05.439 --> 35:07.240
We're a clean town
that the tourist

35:07.274 --> 35:08.876
is not afraid to come to Aspen.

35:09.309 --> 35:10.712
If Hunter Thompson wins,

35:10.745 --> 35:13.146
we're gonna have murders here.

35:13.948 --> 35:15.883
Hit it, Joker.

35:16.249 --> 35:17.585
<i>Time is running out.</i>

35:17.619 --> 35:19.754
<i>The nation's freaks are
no longer willing</i>

35:19.787 --> 35:23.591
<i>to stand politely by,
incredulous at the disparity</i>

35:23.625 --> 35:27.762
<i>between what could be done
and what is being done.</i>

35:28.428 --> 35:30.263
So why are you doing this?

35:30.297 --> 35:31.933
For the look on Whitmire's face

35:31.966 --> 35:34.836
when I call him my
long-haired opponent.

35:36.537 --> 35:37.939
Good as new.

35:37.972 --> 35:38.973
Thank you, Joker.

35:39.007 --> 35:41.441
Absolutely.
Thanks for bailing me out.

35:46.914 --> 35:48.516
- <i>Savings on...</i>
- <i>Mac...</i>

35:58.593 --> 36:00.561
It's coming on, it's coming on.

36:00.595 --> 36:02.462
All right, here we go,
here we go, here it is.

36:02.496 --> 36:06.500
<i>And this is 10 dollars
for you from all of us at the hospital.</i>

36:06.534 --> 36:09.737
I appreciate that.
Every dollar counts. Thank you.

36:09.771 --> 36:11.204
You guys are doing
great tonight,

36:11.506 --> 36:13.206
and I have a special
guest for you.

36:13.240 --> 36:14.341
Um, come on out.

36:14.374 --> 36:16.309
- Hello, Aspen, Pitkin County.
- Undersheriff...

36:16.644 --> 36:18.378
- Thank you, Eve.
- Yes.

36:18.412 --> 36:20.948
Former Undersheriff Ricks
is joining us.

36:20.982 --> 36:24.484
He is running against
Carol Whitmire

36:24.519 --> 36:26.286
for Sheriff of Pitkin County.

36:26.319 --> 36:27.955
<i>Well thank you Eve for
having me this evening.</i>

36:27.989 --> 36:29.189
<i>I'm very excited.</i>

36:29.222 --> 36:31.693
<i>Okay. And what does
your plan look like?</i>

36:31.726 --> 36:34.327
<i>Whitmire could not get
the transient,</i>

36:34.361 --> 36:36.229
<i>long-haired hippies
out of town,</i>

36:36.496 --> 36:39.600
<i>but us blue collar men with
our shovels and our pickaxes,</i>

36:39.634 --> 36:42.269
<i>we will promise to
clean this town up.</i>

36:42.302 --> 36:43.671
- Oh, dear.
- It's an exciting time...

36:43.705 --> 36:44.872
Okay. Let's take another call.

36:44.906 --> 36:47.407
- ...in Aspen.
- <i>Thank you for your support.</i>

36:47.441 --> 36:49.944
Huh-hey, uh, this Bud Screw.

36:49.977 --> 36:52.412
I'm down by the school
handing out Quaalude

36:52.446 --> 36:53.981
- to all the kiddies.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

36:54.015 --> 36:55.750
- Oh, another one.
- That was weird.

36:55.783 --> 36:57.819
- Hello?
- Hello, Miss Eve?

36:57.852 --> 37:01.522
Um, I found your broomstick
and it reeks of Whitmire.

37:01.556 --> 37:02.890
Peggy Clifford, Aspen Times.

37:02.924 --> 37:04.892
I was wondering, is this
a fundraiser to bail out

37:04.926 --> 37:07.494
your seven friends who were
arrested for election fraud?

37:08.428 --> 37:10.698
Is anyone screening these calls?

37:10.732 --> 37:12.299
That's... that's that
Thompson crew.

37:12.700 --> 37:13.701
This is nonsense.

37:15.103 --> 37:17.237
And I can tell you one thing,
they're not gonna stop at prank calls.

37:17.471 --> 37:19.406
They're going to show up at
the ballot boxes.

37:19.439 --> 37:21.475
<i>We're not gonna take it
in Aspen.</i>

37:21.509 --> 37:23.343
<i>We're not gonna take it
in Pitkin County.</i>

37:23.376 --> 37:24.746
<i>You guys need to show up
and vote.</i>

37:27.481 --> 37:28.616
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

37:28.983 --> 37:30.918
This is Martin Boreman.

37:31.318 --> 37:32.486
<i>Thank you
for your call...</i>

37:33.921 --> 37:36.891
I believe the
Undersheriff's plan to form a posse

37:37.525 --> 37:41.294
is the final solution to
Aspen's hippie problem.

37:41.863 --> 37:46.433
What we need is an excuse to
access the weapons

37:46.466 --> 37:47.969
that he is stockpiling.

37:48.468 --> 37:52.039
What we need is a flat out
ding dong riot.

37:52.439 --> 37:53.541
Heil-ho Mire!

37:53.574 --> 37:55.442
<i>We're gonna
cut to commercial.</i>

37:55.475 --> 37:57.344
- <i>Let's cut to commercial.</i>
- <i>It was probably one of those hippies with...</i>

38:03.785 --> 38:06.654
<i>Hunter Thompson is a
moralist posing as an immoralist.</i>

38:12.927 --> 38:14.729
<i>...whoever gets elected.</i>

38:14.762 --> 38:15.963
<i>But Hunter represents
something...</i>

38:15.997 --> 38:17.865
Good job, Young Wood!

38:17.899 --> 38:19.767
Young Wood on the camera!

38:20.034 --> 38:23.004
Young Wood!

38:23.638 --> 38:25.673
<i>The only thing
against him is he's a visionary.</i>

38:26.073 --> 38:27.742
<i>He wants too pure a world.</i>

38:29.877 --> 38:31.979
<i>The preceding
a paid political announcement</i>

38:32.479 --> 38:34.115
<i>by the Thompson for
Sheriff Brigade.</i>

38:36.449 --> 38:38.519
<i>These are real people
with real lives.</i>

38:39.654 --> 38:42.455
If this is a joke,
you should drop out.

38:42.890 --> 38:44.357
Now. Like right now.

38:44.525 --> 38:45.827
<i>It's the best of both worlds.</i>

38:46.661 --> 38:48.930
<i>I write the article,
I win Sheriff.</i>

38:50.397 --> 38:52.700
I mean, it's a good
ending to the story.

38:53.668 --> 38:54.669
Trust me.

38:55.069 --> 38:56.336
I do.

38:56.737 --> 38:59.073
- Sort of.
- Until the wheels fall off.

40:18.920 --> 40:19.921
Are you okay?

40:29.797 --> 40:31.532
Should we shut this party down?

40:32.533 --> 40:35.503
Hunter, you can't
shut this down.

40:35.536 --> 40:37.738
You bought the ticket,
you've gotta take the ride.

40:39.106 --> 40:42.843
There aren't enough freaks to
vote for me to win.

40:42.877 --> 40:44.145
There aren't enough of them.

40:44.178 --> 40:47.982
Freaks are anyone who
isn't making

40:48.015 --> 40:51.118
a million dollars by selling their
neighbor's land out from under them.

40:52.019 --> 40:53.921
It's the good and
respectable folks

40:53.955 --> 40:55.656
who just want to raise
their family here

40:55.690 --> 40:58.259
without being told what to do
by a bunch of corporate suits.

40:58.292 --> 41:00.995
And I have much more in
common with them

41:01.028 --> 41:03.698
than those other people,
you know, I do.

41:03.731 --> 41:06.934
I mean, hunting, freedom,
fucking liberty, justice,

41:06.968 --> 41:08.536
stay the fuck off my property.

41:08.569 --> 41:12.039
Walk into the Red Onion and tell them
exactly what you just said to me because

41:12.073 --> 41:14.008
what they don't realize is
that they're freaks

41:14.041 --> 41:15.076
and if they don't get on board,

41:16.243 --> 41:17.712
their Aspen isn't going to be
around very much longer.

41:17.745 --> 41:19.013
All right, so we hit
the Red Onion,

41:19.046 --> 41:21.649
we hit the retirement homes,
we hit the cowboys,

41:23.217 --> 41:24.484
and we give it to 'em.

41:26.153 --> 41:27.555
I gotta get out of here.

41:36.864 --> 41:39.000
<i>The rising tide
is a far bigger thing</i>

41:39.033 --> 41:43.504
<i>than any ephemeral argument
about peace or drugs or hair.</i>

41:44.271 --> 41:46.107
<i>We're going to deal with
the buggers head on</i>

41:46.140 --> 41:48.609
<i>and on their own turf
and beat them.</i>

41:51.912 --> 41:54.749
What does Freak Power mean?
Is it some kind of code?

41:54.782 --> 41:56.851
Uh, Freak Power, you know,

41:56.884 --> 41:59.754
it's a crude piece of
political theater.

41:59.787 --> 42:02.757
This works, maybe too
well at the expense

42:02.990 --> 42:04.058
of the serious action.

42:04.925 --> 42:07.094
Seizing control of
the government

42:07.128 --> 42:08.829
and returning it to
the hands of the people

42:08.863 --> 42:11.966
who actually live here,
not just the land rapers

42:11.999 --> 42:13.334
and the real estate pimps
who are trying

42:13.367 --> 42:15.036
to sell this town from under us.

42:15.636 --> 42:17.271
Aspen needs to keep growing.

42:17.304 --> 42:19.740
Yeah, but when things move
extremely fast,

42:19.774 --> 42:22.243
they move, you know, recklessly.

42:22.276 --> 42:24.045
As you can see.
Just walk around.

42:25.212 --> 42:26.213
All right, Peggy.

42:26.947 --> 42:28.182
There we go.

42:28.816 --> 42:29.950
Shoo.

42:29.984 --> 42:32.186
An impressive performance,
Mr. Thompson.

42:32.219 --> 42:33.788
Care to comment for the paper?

42:33.821 --> 42:35.022
I'm incredibly high, Peggy.

42:35.056 --> 42:36.290
Oh God, on what?

42:37.024 --> 42:39.260
The notion of
changing the world.

42:42.329 --> 42:44.665
Nice change.

42:44.698 --> 42:45.833
Let's get the fuck outta here.

43:42.323 --> 43:43.324
Hey guys.

43:44.458 --> 43:46.427
Free <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
I want you guys to read this

43:46.460 --> 43:48.162
if you want to know what's
happening to our town.

43:48.762 --> 43:50.197
Heil-ho Mire!

44:02.243 --> 44:04.078
Man, I think you'd do better
buying all these things up.

44:04.712 --> 44:05.713
Buying them up?

44:07.148 --> 44:08.315
Suppressing my own press?

44:08.349 --> 44:11.385
Censoring myself
in the interest of victory?

44:11.418 --> 44:13.888
Why would you not wait
until the election was over?

44:13.921 --> 44:16.690
No one's going to run an article
about a lost election.

44:16.724 --> 44:18.959
Yeah, but you gave up our whole
campaign strategy here.

44:18.993 --> 44:20.161
This is supposed to
be a campaign

44:20.194 --> 44:23.364
about self-preservation,
not self-promotion.

44:23.397 --> 44:24.533
Well think about it this way,
you know,

44:24.566 --> 44:27.301
in case we lost, you know,
we get our tactics out there

44:27.334 --> 44:30.070
and someone else somewhere,
you know, might...

44:30.471 --> 44:33.073
Anyway, we're not going to lose
and now the world knows.

44:33.307 --> 44:36.277
Hunter, small towns don't like
making headlines.

44:36.310 --> 44:38.812
It only happens when they're
destroyed by tornadoes

44:38.846 --> 44:40.915
or they're inhabited by
mass murderers.

44:40.948 --> 44:44.218
Incorrect. You guys are
absolutely wrong.

44:45.119 --> 44:47.488
Okay. We'll just salvage
the campaign now, shall we?

44:47.522 --> 44:49.256
He let his ego write
this whole thing.

44:49.990 --> 44:51.792
That fascist haircut's
going to his head.

44:54.962 --> 44:58.365
I can run for Sheriff or I can
write an article about it.

44:58.399 --> 45:00.935
I don't understand
what the problem is,

45:00.968 --> 45:04.939
but apparently it had
a negative impact on

45:05.940 --> 45:11.245
the way that people in the town
perceived my intentions.

45:12.913 --> 45:15.449
I've never seen you lose
a fight that you believe in.

45:16.317 --> 45:19.420
I just feel like up until now
you haven't believed in this.

45:20.555 --> 45:22.856
You're right.

45:29.363 --> 45:31.098
All right, you can do it,
you bastard.

45:36.036 --> 45:37.338
All right, let's do this.

45:43.043 --> 45:45.379
Contrary to widespread
rumors and a plague

45:45.412 --> 45:48.482
of wishful thinking,
I, Hunter S. Thompson,

45:48.516 --> 45:52.086
am dead serious about
my candidacy for Sheriff

45:52.119 --> 45:53.921
of Pitkin County, Colorado.

45:55.590 --> 45:58.892
<i>The Sheriff's office could be
used to good effect.</i>

46:00.361 --> 46:03.230
To help slow development,
stop pollution

46:03.497 --> 46:05.266
and end consumer fraud.

46:06.267 --> 46:10.204
<i>My aim is to encourage
citizen participation</i>

46:10.237 --> 46:14.108
<i>in government as was advocated
by our founding fathers.</i>

46:15.943 --> 46:18.445
<i>We either have
a participatory democracy,</i>

46:19.480 --> 46:21.081
<i>or a police state.</i>

46:22.517 --> 46:25.319
The only power
we have is the vote.

46:26.153 --> 46:28.556
And as the war rages on
in Vietnam

46:29.923 --> 46:33.961
and as civil rights continue to be a
deep, dark stain on our nation's history,

46:34.428 --> 46:38.966
I believe we can make it work
here in Pitkin County.

46:58.653 --> 46:59.853
Yeah, it blindsided us.

47:01.188 --> 47:02.590
- I don't know, I mean...
- Yeah, I'm really sorry, guys.

47:03.023 --> 47:05.893
I had some bills to pay as
Young Ed Wood knows.

47:05.926 --> 47:10.064
I have a bit of a fuckin' tab
at the, well, everywhere.

47:10.097 --> 47:12.966
And more importantly, I thought
I'd get the story out.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.469
Well it seems like it
worked out, man.

47:15.502 --> 47:17.104
There's volunteers and
reporters from everywhere.

47:17.137 --> 47:20.407
Phones ringing off the hook. We're even
getting cash donations for the war chest.

47:20.441 --> 47:21.609
- Really?
- Yeah.

47:21.643 --> 47:23.410
Incredible. I thought
I'd fucked everything up.

47:23.444 --> 47:24.445
Young Ed Wood!

47:24.478 --> 47:26.514
Listen, if you're going to
be skipping school,

47:26.548 --> 47:28.916
at least capture
the success story.

47:28.949 --> 47:30.518
You still probably want to check
in with Peggy though.

47:30.552 --> 47:31.720
She seems pretty upset.

47:31.753 --> 47:33.921
That article threw her through a loop.

47:33.954 --> 47:35.422
Hey. Hey, Spiro.

47:35.456 --> 47:36.524
Was that a face fart?

47:45.032 --> 47:46.601
<i>Hey.</i>

47:46.634 --> 47:48.570
Can you get Peggy?

47:49.303 --> 47:50.371
Get Peggy.

47:55.142 --> 47:58.278
Hey, um, I'm really sorry Peggy.

47:58.713 --> 48:01.915
That was demented behavior
on my behalf, you know?

48:01.949 --> 48:04.586
We should have most definitely
put it to a vote.

48:05.219 --> 48:07.354
It just...
it wasn't yours to sell.

48:07.388 --> 48:09.323
You gave away
our entire strategy.

48:10.057 --> 48:11.492
I fucked up. Can you forgive me?

48:12.993 --> 48:14.629
If you're serious. I mean, do you
really want to make this thing work?

48:14.662 --> 48:16.230
Of course I want to make
this thing work.

48:16.664 --> 48:18.899
Okay well if you do,

48:19.266 --> 48:22.236
we've given away the element of
surprise, so you better ace the debate.

48:25.573 --> 48:28.475
Okay, prison conditions.
What do you think about prison conditions?

48:28.510 --> 48:31.646
They need to learn a craft,
you know, a trade.

48:31.679 --> 48:34.381
You know, construction,
home improvement.

48:34.415 --> 48:37.451
People need to leave prison
better citizens

48:37.484 --> 48:39.521
than when they enter prison.

48:45.125 --> 48:48.663
Dear Lord, let me win
this election.

48:49.597 --> 48:51.064
Let me take back Aspen.

48:51.098 --> 48:53.934
Be there for me,
and I will be there for you.

48:55.737 --> 48:57.137
Um, marijuana.

48:57.171 --> 48:58.640
We're gonna need to
lock up all of

48:58.673 --> 49:02.309
the for-profit drug dealers
and legalize marijuana

49:02.342 --> 49:04.244
and other drugs in general.

49:04.779 --> 49:06.480
I know exactly what he's doing,

49:07.515 --> 49:08.449
what they're all doing.

49:08.482 --> 49:10.585
They're trying to bring in
voters into Aspen

49:11.151 --> 49:13.454
to create some kind of
a communist experiment.

49:13.487 --> 49:14.656
That's what they're doin'.

49:25.767 --> 49:27.769
What about these permits for
the roads downtown?

49:27.802 --> 49:31.171
Fuck roads. We need to return
this town to nature.

49:31.438 --> 49:34.041
Grass is good.

49:47.655 --> 49:49.189
Do you think I'm gonna win?

49:49.724 --> 49:52.125
Maybe you might win or
maybe you might not.

49:53.327 --> 49:54.461
I love you.

50:09.811 --> 50:11.546
- I'm ready if you guys are.
- I'm set.

50:12.814 --> 50:14.448
<i>Presenting live,
the Pitkin County</i>

50:14.481 --> 50:16.383
<i>Sheriff debate of 1970.</i>

50:17.785 --> 50:20.688
<i>Aspen, we've done what we've
always done as Westerners.</i>

50:20.722 --> 50:23.490
<i>When we're under siege,
what we do is we circle the wagons.</i>

50:23.525 --> 50:24.559
<i>That's who we are.</i>

50:25.627 --> 50:26.561
<i>I mean, I've been here
my whole life.</i>

50:27.261 --> 50:29.029
In fact, I used to do this job

50:29.597 --> 50:31.533
with just a flashlight
and a smile

50:31.766 --> 50:34.736
and now I have my deputies
out there wearing flak jackets.

50:34.769 --> 50:36.704
Ho Chi Minh isn't
tunneling under Aspen.

50:36.738 --> 50:38.840
That's Mine Co.

50:38.873 --> 50:40.775
Lookie here, you're about
to elect a man

50:40.808 --> 50:43.678
that calls police officers pigs.

50:44.144 --> 50:47.414
The only pig
in this town is you.

50:47.715 --> 50:51.385
When I become Sheriff,
I will put Thompson in jail,

50:51.418 --> 50:53.755
and that's... that's my promise
to you, Aspen.

50:54.454 --> 50:57.825
All right, Glenn, it's 1970,
not 1870 all right?

50:59.159 --> 51:01.596
We cannot expect people
to have respect

51:01.629 --> 51:04.498
for law and order until
we teach respect

51:04.532 --> 51:07.769
to those we've entrusted to
enforce those laws.

51:08.135 --> 51:09.637
Well, tell me how you're going
to keep the peace

51:09.671 --> 51:11.305
when you're high on marijuana?

51:11.539 --> 51:12.774
<i>I don't really like marijuana.</i>

51:14.341 --> 51:17.411
<i>I much prefer more active
things like acid and mescaline.</i>

51:17.812 --> 51:20.380
So what you're telling
everybody right now

51:20.414 --> 51:23.150
is that you would use mescaline
while you're on duty?

51:24.418 --> 51:27.187
Maybe on the slow nights.

51:27.689 --> 51:30.558
Marijuana laws are
one of those reasons

51:30.592 --> 51:33.126
that have engendered
this lack of respect

51:33.160 --> 51:35.495
that cops complain about
across the country.

51:35.897 --> 51:38.900
<i>You get a whole generation
who grew up felons,</i>

51:38.933 --> 51:40.434
who know the law is ridiculous,

51:40.467 --> 51:42.135
but they're told
all this gibberish

51:42.169 --> 51:45.607
that dope rots your brain and
makes your feet fall off.

51:45.640 --> 51:48.509
I mean even the cops know it's a silly law.

51:48.876 --> 51:50.277
<i>But I did ask you a question.</i>

51:50.545 --> 51:52.245
Carol doesn't know
what he's doing.

51:52.279 --> 51:53.213
He wasn't ready for this.

51:53.246 --> 51:56.551
No more land rapes,
busts for flute playing.

51:56.584 --> 51:59.152
<i>Fuck the tourists,
dead-end the highway</i>

51:59.186 --> 52:01.154
<i>and zone the greed heads
out of existence.</i>

52:01.188 --> 52:04.826
Create a town where people
can live like human beings

52:04.859 --> 52:08.529
as opposed to slaves to some
bogus sense of progress

52:08.563 --> 52:10.665
that's driving us all mad.

52:16.403 --> 52:21.542
I am not going to sit here
with this Kentucky fried reject.

52:21.576 --> 52:24.411
- Tell us how you feel, man.
- This is my town.

52:24.579 --> 52:27.447
Oh my goodness. What is Ricks doing?

52:27.882 --> 52:29.383
Drop out, Ricks.

52:29.416 --> 52:30.918
Drop out, Ricks.

52:43.263 --> 52:44.297
Okay.

52:44.331 --> 52:47.802
I really don't know about
Mr. Thomson's big ideas

52:48.402 --> 52:51.806
and I don't think they really
concern the Sheriff.

52:51.839 --> 52:54.942
In fact, I don't think he really
wants to be Sheriff,

52:56.276 --> 52:59.580
but I do, so what I say to you

52:59.614 --> 53:02.517
is why don't you play your
games somewhere else?

53:03.551 --> 53:05.218
I think Aspen's ready for it.

53:05.687 --> 53:07.855
Not only for a new
kind of Sheriff,

53:07.889 --> 53:10.357
but a whole new style
of government,

53:10.758 --> 53:13.293
the type of thing
Thomas Jefferson had in mind

53:13.326 --> 53:15.495
when he talked about democracy.

53:16.531 --> 53:19.834
Citizens having a real hand in
shaping their own destiny.

53:20.500 --> 53:23.738
And in this era of the automatic
bureaucratic rebuff,

53:24.438 --> 53:27.542
it may seem radical
or even freaky,

53:27.575 --> 53:30.745
but it is the concept on which
America was founded.

53:57.839 --> 53:59.674
<i>Pitkin County,
Colorado, was about to elect</i>

53:59.707 --> 54:01.976
<i>the nation's first
mescaline Sheriff,</i>

54:03.376 --> 54:05.378
<i>a foul-mouthed, bald-headed
freak who refused</i>

54:05.412 --> 54:07.014
<i>to compromise on
anything at all,</i>

54:08.315 --> 54:09.717
<i>even his taste for wild drugs</i>

54:09.751 --> 54:12.587
<i>and who didn't mind
saying in public</i>

54:12.787 --> 54:15.022
<i>that he intended
to hamstring, filet</i>

54:15.056 --> 54:17.357
<i>and cripple every greedy plot</i>

54:17.390 --> 54:19.694
<i>the Aspen power structure
held dear.</i>

54:22.563 --> 54:25.432
You know, it's an isolated town

54:25.465 --> 54:28.335
with a very unusual kind
of population.

54:31.338 --> 54:34.542
We do have a Freak Power base
and that's undeniable.

54:38.846 --> 54:40.815
We have about 1,000
votes that would,

54:40.848 --> 54:43.050
if I walked on
the streets naked,

54:44.384 --> 54:47.320
bomb in each hand,
drugs dripping,

54:47.789 --> 54:52.026
covered in sticky substances
known to be foul drugs,

54:52.927 --> 54:54.361
they would still vote for me.

55:14.682 --> 55:16.684
That was brilliant.
Thank you for your time, Dr. Thompson.

55:16.717 --> 55:18.152
- Appreciate it.
- Good luck.

55:18.186 --> 55:20.387
- Thank you.
- Hey Hunter, this guy's from <i>Life</i>.

55:21.155 --> 55:22.089
<i>Life.</i>

55:22.123 --> 55:24.391
They're thinking about
giving us the cover.

55:24.424 --> 55:27.427
Nice. All right, <i>Life</i> it is.

55:28.863 --> 55:29.997
Come in.

55:31.431 --> 55:33.968
Glenn, how are you?
Have a drink.

55:34.001 --> 55:35.636
Oh. Doing well.

55:35.670 --> 55:36.771
Why, thank you.

55:37.605 --> 55:38.739
Um...

55:39.472 --> 55:40.473
Glenn?

55:41.509 --> 55:42.777
You're going to have to drop
out of this race.

55:44.612 --> 55:46.714
So you've never taken me
seriously this whole time.

55:46.747 --> 55:48.015
I know you're upset.

55:48.049 --> 55:49.750
I mean, I understand it.
It's okay.

55:49.784 --> 55:51.586
You could start a new
life somewhere.

55:51.619 --> 55:53.521
I'm not leaving this town and
I'm not leaving this race.

55:53.554 --> 55:54.956
You're done Ricks. You're done.

55:57.191 --> 55:59.560
Sit down, Carol.

56:01.562 --> 56:03.865
Have an apple.

56:06.868 --> 56:07.969
You know what I like about you?

56:09.704 --> 56:10.671
You're dependable.

56:12.540 --> 56:14.441
When this whole
crazy election is over,

56:14.474 --> 56:15.710
can I depend on you to make sure

56:15.743 --> 56:17.945
this never happens
in our town again?

56:19.146 --> 56:20.147
Yes, ma'am.

56:21.983 --> 56:24.552
Good.

56:35.029 --> 56:38.833
You work on "A vote for Ricks
is a vote for Thompson."

56:38.866 --> 56:41.569
- Okay.
- How about "The status quo is the way to go."?

56:41.602 --> 56:44.805
Nothing says you care
like a handwritten note.

56:44.839 --> 56:46.874
Okay, ladies, let's divide up.

56:46.908 --> 56:48.475
I will take Main Street.

56:48.509 --> 56:50.077
We're going to go door to door.

56:50.111 --> 56:51.545
I want you to hand these out.

56:51.579 --> 56:54.015
Don't miss a single person,
understand?

56:55.016 --> 56:56.117
Great.

56:56.150 --> 56:57.151
Let's do it.

56:58.152 --> 56:59.153
Door to door.

56:59.921 --> 57:02.857
And try to be very personal,
right?

57:02.890 --> 57:05.026
You know, ask them how
their kids are doing.

57:05.893 --> 57:07.962
Tell 'em that their
biscuits smell good.

57:10.898 --> 57:12.166
Watch out for these
questions in here

57:12.199 --> 57:14.101
that ask about
occupation and business.

57:14.135 --> 57:15.770
It's classic voter intimidation.

57:15.803 --> 57:17.571
<i>Gotta come together on this.</i>

57:17.605 --> 57:18.906
<i>We need to do whatever it
takes to get rid of Hunter Thompson.</i>

57:18.940 --> 57:21.776
- <i>He is bad news for Aspen.</i>
- Thank you.

57:21.809 --> 57:22.810
Good to see you, Jack.

57:25.513 --> 57:27.181
Mimeo's broken again.

57:27.214 --> 57:29.984
Then fix it.
Problems love solutions.

57:30.017 --> 57:32.086
I'm the only one who does
anything around here.

57:32.787 --> 57:34.487
Does anyone know how
to fix a Mimeo?

57:34.522 --> 57:35.589
Yeah, I can fix one.

57:36.924 --> 57:39.560
I think...
Ah, there.

57:40.294 --> 57:41.796
It was just a little
constipated.

57:41.829 --> 57:43.496
All right. Anything else?

57:43.764 --> 57:45.967
Yeah. Where is Hunter?

57:46.867 --> 57:48.970
Muhammad Ali
didn't think it was fair

57:49.003 --> 57:51.038
that he needed to go
fight a war

57:51.072 --> 57:52.974
against the Vietcong
who had never

57:53.007 --> 57:54.508
done anything wrong to him.

57:55.076 --> 57:58.946
So he went to jail and
he didn't fight for three years.

57:59.246 --> 58:01.182
Now this is his comeback fight.

58:01.215 --> 58:02.917
<i>We're making
a coalition...</i>

58:02.950 --> 58:04.719
<i>Democrats and
Republicans are teamin' up.</i>

58:04.752 --> 58:05.886
<i>We have to save our town.</i>

58:05.920 --> 58:07.621
<i>Republican party
is droppin' Ricks.</i>

58:07.888 --> 58:10.825
Vote Whitmire.
Tell Jim to vote Whitmire.

58:10.858 --> 58:12.059
Vote Whitmire.

58:12.093 --> 58:13.694
Oh, see that right?

58:13.728 --> 58:14.862
That's what they call
a counter punch.

58:14.895 --> 58:16.897
That's when someone
tries to punch you

58:16.931 --> 58:19.100
and instead of letting
them hit you,

58:19.133 --> 58:21.268
you dodge the punch and
you hit 'em back. Counter.

58:21.736 --> 58:24.171
Vote Whitmire. You know that.
Don't have to tell you.

58:24.205 --> 58:26.540
Oh hey, Jennifer, look at you.

58:26.941 --> 58:29.744
No below the belt.

58:29.777 --> 58:31.979
That was legal.

58:32.013 --> 58:33.581
Good to see ya, Sue.

58:42.023 --> 58:44.025
Okay, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

58:44.792 --> 58:47.995
I... I've just learned that Ricks
is being dropped.

58:48.963 --> 58:50.998
That means this isn't
a three-way race anymore.

58:51.766 --> 58:53.801
The fucking Democrats
and Republicans

58:53.834 --> 58:55.102
are teaming up against us.

58:56.303 --> 58:59.907
So if we stand a chance of
beating those hypocrites now,

58:59.940 --> 59:02.676
we need every single last
one of our voters,

59:03.110 --> 59:07.281
which means our get out the vote
operation starts before dawn.

59:07.314 --> 59:08.315
So please...

59:09.550 --> 59:12.319
Finish your drinks and go home.
We got a big day tomorrow.

59:18.659 --> 59:19.760
We better get to work.

59:21.128 --> 59:22.329
I'm gonna go home, okay?

59:23.664 --> 59:24.665
Hunter.

59:26.400 --> 59:27.701
It's the last hour.

59:33.240 --> 59:35.309
<i>The race was going
to be very close.</i>

59:35.810 --> 59:38.846
<i>After a savage fire-sucking
campaign,</i>

59:38.879 --> 59:41.782
<i>the major parties forged
an unholy alliance</i>

59:43.350 --> 59:45.886
<i>and expected me to hunker down</i>

59:45.920 --> 59:48.189
<i>like a natural gentlemen
and take a beating.</i>

59:49.824 --> 59:52.359
<i>But the '60s were full of
examples of good men</i>

59:52.393 --> 59:55.696
<i>challenging the establishment
and being assassinated</i>

59:55.729 --> 59:58.065
<i>under
mysterious circumstances.</i>

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:05.072
<i>Rumor was we'd be
attacked by a lone gunman</i>

01:00:05.106 --> 01:00:08.275
<i>or the Hell's Angels or
a posse of firefighters</i>

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:10.744
<i>and construction workers
or wolverines.</i>

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:14.348
<i>I know the rumors because
I started them.</i>

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:32.900
We might not be the law yet,

01:00:33.868 --> 01:00:35.236
but we are not to be
fucked with.

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:39.140
All right, so, if they try to fuck with us Freaks,

01:00:39.807 --> 01:00:42.810
then they suffer the consequences
that are due to them.

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:48.949
<i>Tomorrow morning, Aspen's
long, smoldering generation gat</i>

01:00:49.283 --> 01:00:52.186
<i>exits the trench warfare
stages.</i>

01:00:52.453 --> 01:00:55.422
<i>As it spills out
onto the streets</i>

01:00:55.456 --> 01:01:01.295
<i>of the previously peaceful
Aspen, the world is watching!</i>

01:01:01.328 --> 01:01:02.997
<i>Hell yeah!</i>

01:01:14.041 --> 01:01:17.178
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:46.740
Saddle up freaks!

01:01:46.774 --> 01:01:48.409
Ride 'em up!

01:01:48.442 --> 01:01:51.745
Let's take 'em out!

01:01:56.784 --> 01:01:58.185
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

01:01:58.219 --> 01:02:00.454
Here we go, this is it.
Today is the day.

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:03.390
Each one of you is
assigned to a precinct.

01:02:03.424 --> 01:02:06.126
We are recording every moment,
any challenge.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.195
<i>This is American history
that we're making.</i>

01:02:08.229 --> 01:02:09.463
You hold on to the mescaline.

01:02:09.496 --> 01:02:10.831
Don't drink it.

01:02:11.065 --> 01:02:12.066
Discard it.

01:02:17.438 --> 01:02:19.039
Who are these people?

01:02:19.073 --> 01:02:21.308
I don't know, but they either
have too many drugs

01:02:21.342 --> 01:02:23.911
or not enough.

01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:36.390
For heaven's sakes,
this is ridiculous.

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:38.792
What the hell is going on?

01:02:38.826 --> 01:02:40.794
I don't know.
They got here before we did.

01:02:41.128 --> 01:02:42.863
Hey Mayor, hey Sheriff.

01:02:43.163 --> 01:02:44.865
- Did you see the voters out front?
- Yeah.

01:02:44.898 --> 01:02:46.133
Were they friendly?

01:02:46.166 --> 01:02:48.102
She doesn't look like she's 21.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:50.471
Excuse me, young lady.

01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:52.540
You know you have to
be 21 to vote

01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:54.241
and you know what
happens if you lie?

01:02:54.576 --> 01:02:56.143
I know the damn law.

01:02:56.176 --> 01:02:57.211
Get out of my way.

01:02:58.178 --> 01:02:59.480
You're not gonna
call for backup?

01:03:00.481 --> 01:03:01.915
You have a good day.

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:05.119
I just want to ensure that we
have a free and fair election.

01:03:05.452 --> 01:03:08.255
Yes. This has been a very
exciting election in Aspen.

01:03:13.193 --> 01:03:15.329
I like Hunter Thompson,
I think he's a good man.

01:03:15.362 --> 01:03:17.498
I really do. I think he's got
some real far out ideas.

01:03:18.032 --> 01:03:19.567
I happened to vote for uh,
Thompson,

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.070
because, I don't know,
I'd like to see

01:03:23.103 --> 01:03:26.173
justice done equally
to the rich and the poor.

01:03:26.206 --> 01:03:27.609
At least they have
some new ideas,

01:03:27.642 --> 01:03:29.843
which is more than
the old people have.

01:03:30.978 --> 01:03:33.280
<i>In truth, we are not
really freaks at all,</i>

01:03:33.314 --> 01:03:36.584
<i>not in the literal sense
but the twisted realities</i>

01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:38.852
<i>of the world
we are trying to live in</i>

01:03:38.886 --> 01:03:41.455
<i>have somehow combined to make
us feel like freaks.</i>

01:03:41.955 --> 01:03:46.060
<i>We argue, we protest, we
petition, but nothing changes.</i>

01:03:46.093 --> 01:03:48.128
<i>So now with
the rest of the nation</i>

01:03:48.162 --> 01:03:51.899
<i>erupting in a firestorm of
bombings and political killing,</i>

01:03:51.932 --> 01:03:54.935
<i>a handful of freaks are
running a final,</i>

01:03:54.968 --> 01:03:57.338
<i>perhaps atavistic
experiment with the idea</i>

01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:59.106
<i>of forcing change by voting.</i>

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.475
Now that they see that
we're doing that,

01:04:01.509 --> 01:04:03.344
we're registering to vote,
we are voting,

01:04:03.377 --> 01:04:05.145
we're running our
own candidates,

01:04:05.179 --> 01:04:07.549
oh my God, it's a horror and
they're trying to stop it

01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:09.049
because we're liable to
take it over.

01:04:09.551 --> 01:04:13.621
Hunter Thompson is a socialist.

01:04:13.655 --> 01:04:15.255
Save our town.

01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:17.559
Vote for law and order.

01:04:17.592 --> 01:04:20.562
Let's get the long-hairs out of
here once and for all.

01:04:22.363 --> 01:04:23.364
<i>Deb.</i>

01:04:23.964 --> 01:04:25.199
Debs.

01:04:25.232 --> 01:04:28.068
They're fucking with our
voters at ward two.

01:04:28.102 --> 01:04:29.571
You head to ward 12.

01:04:29.604 --> 01:04:31.338
There won't be no intimidation!

01:04:31.372 --> 01:04:32.272
No intimidation!

01:04:32.306 --> 01:04:33.941
- Okay?
- Let's get these...

01:04:33.974 --> 01:04:35.109
- Handle it!
- Yeah!

01:04:35.142 --> 01:04:36.443
Maximum savagery!

01:04:36.477 --> 01:04:38.379
Okay, all right,
if you're not on a telephone

01:04:38.412 --> 01:04:41.482
in your hand right now, get out
of here, hit the streets.

01:04:41.516 --> 01:04:44.519
There are shacks, lodges,
communes, hovels

01:04:44.552 --> 01:04:47.254
<i>that don't have any phones
but they do have voters.</i>

01:04:47.287 --> 01:04:49.923
The moment is now people.
Get out there.

01:04:49.957 --> 01:04:51.626
Citizens, the two party system

01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:53.561
is the lie that is
killing America.

01:04:53.595 --> 01:04:56.463
Rise up, permit
no jack-boot thuggery.

01:04:57.097 --> 01:04:59.233
Young Wood,
take this tranquilizer gun.

01:04:59.266 --> 01:05:01.335
Load it and get it ready.

01:05:01.368 --> 01:05:03.070
The condition of society

01:05:03.103 --> 01:05:04.471
is proof of your
criminal negligence

01:05:04.506 --> 01:05:06.173
but you won't be long
for this world.

01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:08.142
That lunatic is refusing to let

01:05:08.175 --> 01:05:09.943
that 75-year-old woman
cast her ballot

01:05:09.977 --> 01:05:11.646
until she shows him her
birth certificate.

01:05:11.679 --> 01:05:13.981
- What?
- Fuck. Man, come on.

01:05:14.014 --> 01:05:15.015
Jesus.

01:05:15.983 --> 01:05:17.050
I didn't think it'd
turn into this.

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:18.952
Oh man, we need to
physically remove him.

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:20.120
I'm sorry, ma'am.

01:05:20.154 --> 01:05:21.321
- You're a fuckin' mess.
- Jesus.

01:05:21.355 --> 01:05:23.691
Hey look, your zeal is inspiring

01:05:23.725 --> 01:05:25.192
but we're going to have
to replace you.

01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:26.528
It's for the best interest.

01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:27.662
Wood...

01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:29.163
Oh! Why did you do that?

01:05:29.196 --> 01:05:30.264
You nodded at me to shoot him!

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:33.434
No! I told you to replace as
the fucking poll-watcher, man.

01:05:33.467 --> 01:05:34.968
- Yeah, man.
- Come on.

01:05:35.002 --> 01:05:36.303
Get him in the back.

01:05:36.336 --> 01:05:37.672
Yeah. Get in there.

01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:42.276
Replace the poll-watcher, Wood.

01:05:45.647 --> 01:05:46.681
- Fuckin' hell.
- Oh, shit there's...

01:05:46.714 --> 01:05:49.383
Oh man, and now
the fuckin' pigs are here.

01:05:50.117 --> 01:05:52.186
Damn. Oink, oink.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.055
Shut the fuck up, man,
or you'll be in trouble.

01:05:55.523 --> 01:05:57.124
- All right.
- Stay in the vehicle, Hunter.

01:05:57.157 --> 01:05:58.959
Shut the door.
Stay in the vehicle.

01:05:59.661 --> 01:06:01.028
I don't know why
I'm being pulled over.

01:06:01.061 --> 01:06:04.398
All I know is that you can pull
someone over if you suspect a crime.

01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:06.534
You can't pull me over
hoping to find one.

01:06:07.434 --> 01:06:09.236
I got one question.
Have you been drinking, Hunter?

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:12.439
Maybe mescaline, but you'd have
a hard time proving that.

01:06:12.473 --> 01:06:14.041
You'd be surprised.

01:06:14.074 --> 01:06:15.409
Mike it's not funny.

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:16.644
Who's the guy in the backseat?

01:06:16.678 --> 01:06:18.580
Oh, this is our friend.

01:06:18.613 --> 01:06:20.013
He's a poet, Alan Ginsburg.

01:06:20.582 --> 01:06:21.683
Never heard of him.

01:06:22.817 --> 01:06:24.084
Mr. Ginsburg why don't you step
out of the vehicle?

01:06:26.186 --> 01:06:27.154
Oh, here we go.

01:06:27.187 --> 01:06:28.623
Yeah, here we go, Hunter.

01:06:29.089 --> 01:06:31.358
Come on, Alan. Let's give
the Sheriff an oratory.

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:33.293
Oh, yeah.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.668
What, is this guy trippin'?
He's just hopped up?

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:47.675
Where the hell is he goin'?

01:06:47.709 --> 01:06:51.111
You know, I... I don't think that
was Alan Ginsburg after all.

01:06:51.144 --> 01:06:52.547
Are you not gonna help this man?

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.381
He's running around like
a crazy chicken.

01:06:54.414 --> 01:06:55.783
He's your friend.

01:06:55.817 --> 01:06:58.352
You know, he was a con man,
I'm sure of it.

01:06:59.286 --> 01:07:00.655
Good work.

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:01.789
Mr. Ginsburg!

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:05.125
At least we got rid of
that lunatic.

01:07:05.158 --> 01:07:06.493
- Pigs.
- Two birds with one stone.

01:07:06.528 --> 01:07:07.629
Alan Ginsburg!

01:07:08.395 --> 01:07:09.396
Alan!

01:07:10.264 --> 01:07:11.465
Oh, hell.

01:07:11.498 --> 01:07:12.734
That's probably not
even his name.

01:07:16.704 --> 01:07:19.439
<i>All right, we've
cached 600 of our voters.</i>

01:07:19.473 --> 01:07:22.175
That means we have at least
150 of our Freaks

01:07:22.209 --> 01:07:23.711
who have not made it
to the polls yet,

01:07:23.878 --> 01:07:25.647
and they close in two hours,
people.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.715
We need to scour
the park benches

01:07:27.749 --> 01:07:29.717
or we will lose this thing.

01:07:29.751 --> 01:07:33.420
Time to rouse the stragglers
with a blizzard of enthusiasm.

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:37.357
This is Hunter S. Thompson
and I was wondering

01:07:37.391 --> 01:07:39.393
if you were gonna get out
and vote today?

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:41.596
Um...

01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:43.130
Yes.

01:07:43.163 --> 01:07:45.299
The freaky one.
That would be me.

01:07:45.733 --> 01:07:48.101
Well, that's very disappointing.

01:07:51.405 --> 01:07:53.775
Mike will be making some grub.

01:07:53.808 --> 01:07:57.545
There'll be satchels of brain
rattling drugs for everybody

01:07:57.579 --> 01:08:00.113
who wants to end this
on a high note.

01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:02.951
Okay, okay, okay.

01:08:02.984 --> 01:08:05.620
There will be a party but please
keep working for now.

01:08:05.653 --> 01:08:08.488
I want you working
like coal miners

01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:11.258
at a cave-in!

01:08:13.493 --> 01:08:15.262
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

01:08:16.831 --> 01:08:18.533
We came to see you. See how
things are going. Have you voted yet?

01:08:18.566 --> 01:08:20.635
- Voted?
- The polls close soon.

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:21.669
Vote. I have to vote.

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:24.839
Come on, Juan, let's go exercise
out constitutional rights.

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:26.273
I'm driving.

01:08:26.305 --> 01:08:27.642
Okay. Good idea.

01:08:27.675 --> 01:08:29.309
Someone take my cattle prod.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:31.278
I'm going to vote.

01:08:34.413 --> 01:08:36.684
Have you been to the polls yet
this afternoon, sir?

01:08:36.718 --> 01:08:38.285
All right, we're down to
the last two hours.

01:08:38.318 --> 01:08:39.621
You're going to have to
leave work early

01:08:39.654 --> 01:08:41.154
if you want your vote to count.

01:08:41.589 --> 01:08:43.290
All right.
Thank you very much.

01:08:43.323 --> 01:08:44.358
Thanks for your support.

01:08:46.493 --> 01:08:47.493
You don't even have any hair.

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:49.462
I mean you had the craziest
hair in the world.

01:08:50.965 --> 01:08:52.667
This might be our next Sheriff,
right there.

01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:55.202
Hey.
Juan, this is the poll-watcher.

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:58.270
She will be making sure there's
no corruption happening.

01:08:58.305 --> 01:08:59.774
- How are we doing?
- About even.

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.009
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:02.877
- You are?
- Excellent. You hear that Juan? We're even.

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:03.944
- He is.
- Let's go vote.

01:09:03.978 --> 01:09:05.312
Good luck, Hunter.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.515
All right, buddy.
We need some privacy.

01:09:09.316 --> 01:09:11.318
- Here we go.
- I know which one to take.

01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:13.554
No. First we need to vote.

01:09:14.388 --> 01:09:15.622
So who are we gonna vote for?

01:09:15.657 --> 01:09:16.890
We've got Ricks.

01:09:17.959 --> 01:09:19.527
What do you think about Ricks?

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:22.630
What about Whitmire? Whitmire?

01:09:22.663 --> 01:09:26.433
What about Hunter Thompson?

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:27.935
- Is that the one?
- Yeah.

01:09:27.969 --> 01:09:29.937
- All right, let's vote for him.
- But Whitmire I'll steal a cupcake from.

01:09:29.970 --> 01:09:32.506
All right, perfect. Here we go.

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:36.577
- Voting sticker, buddy.
- Ow.

01:09:39.714 --> 01:09:41.616
In the end,
we're not all that different.

01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:54.529
<i>Okay everyone, phones down.</i>

01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:56.931
The polls are now closed.

01:09:56.964 --> 01:09:59.734
All right. Thank you all so much
for your hard work.

01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:02.235
What's done is done.
Now we wait.

01:10:02.269 --> 01:10:04.939
So let the party commence.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.942
Thank you.

01:10:07.975 --> 01:10:10.343
Let's head to the bar!

01:10:17.985 --> 01:10:19.419
Oh.

01:10:19.453 --> 01:10:21.756
You realize that we are
actually gonna win big.

01:10:21.789 --> 01:10:23.591
Feel this, we're gonna win big!

01:10:24.357 --> 01:10:26.627
If we win it'll be by
less than 25 votes.

01:10:26.928 --> 01:10:28.563
Politics is addictive.

01:10:28.596 --> 01:10:32.667
We must be very careful not to
show any signs of addiction.

01:10:32.867 --> 01:10:35.937
I think right now, Hunter, what you
need is another sip of the mescaline.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.404
I do.

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.306
That is not what
he needs right now.

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:42.944
Feels good.

01:10:43.578 --> 01:10:45.412
Yeah, they believe
we're gonna win.

01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:48.816
They believe this is
the start of a movement.

01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:51.451
They believe in you, Hunter.

01:10:53.353 --> 01:10:54.555
You gotta decide if
you want them

01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:58.726
to remember you
for all this or for this.

01:10:59.326 --> 01:11:01.829
Yeah, but if it wasn't for this,
I'd be an accountant.

01:11:01.863 --> 01:11:03.396
- Oh, come on.
- But it's true.

01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:05.700
Say it enough and you might
end up believing it.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.735
Well, I'm gonna go to my room.

01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:12.039
This is worse than waiting
around in the maternity ward.

01:11:12.740 --> 01:11:14.609
All right, we'll come get
you when you win.

01:11:15.843 --> 01:11:16.844
Sheriff.

01:11:24.986 --> 01:11:27.387
Hunter, man, you gotta get out here, man.

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:29.056
- Shut up!
- You gotta get out here.

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.992
- Come on!
- Come on, Hunter!

01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:32.560
Hunter! Hunter!

01:11:42.069 --> 01:11:43.671
<i>My advisors are
already gearing up</i>

01:11:43.704 --> 01:11:46.306
<i>for the presidential
campaign in '72.</i>

01:11:46.808 --> 01:11:49.442
<i>They seem to think that
I could beat Nixon handily</i>

01:11:49.476 --> 01:11:51.879
<i>with the same kind of
campaign we ran here.</i>

01:11:53.446 --> 01:11:54.615
You gotta get out here, man!

01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:03.758
<i>If a Republican town
like Aspen can elect a Sheriff</i>

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.960
<i>running on
a Freak Power platform,</i>

01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:08.729
<i>then the vote might still
be a viable tool,</i>

01:12:09.797 --> 01:12:11.699
<i>and it might still be
possible to alter</i>

01:12:11.732 --> 01:12:14.535
<i>the mean, fascist drift
of this nation</i>

01:12:14.569 --> 01:12:16.637
<i>without burning it down
in the process.</i>

01:12:26.814 --> 01:12:28.683
There he is.

01:13:03.217 --> 01:13:05.753
Quiet everybody, quiet.
The results are coming in.

01:13:05.786 --> 01:13:09.790
Precinct one, Whitmire 182,

01:13:11.592 --> 01:13:14.862
Hunter 210.

01:13:16.964 --> 01:13:20.167
And for precinct two,
precinct two, precinct two!

01:13:20.868 --> 01:13:26.574
Ricks 23, Whitmire 131,
Hunter 158.

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.711
One more, one more,
one more, one more!

01:13:30.745 --> 01:13:33.014
Okay, all right,
precinct three Ricks 10,

01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:37.919
Whitmire 137, Hunter 182.

01:13:41.856 --> 01:13:44.692
We just won the thing in Aspen!

01:13:50.497 --> 01:13:51.599
Relax.

01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:52.833
Relax.

01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:55.536
Okay, okay, precinct four
precinct four.

01:13:55.569 --> 01:14:00.775
Whitmire 204, Hunter 173.

01:14:03.678 --> 01:14:10.618
Precinct five, 320 for Whitmire,
148 for Hunter.

01:14:11.552 --> 01:14:13.955
I think, uh,
it doesn't look good.

01:14:16.524 --> 01:14:17.658
Precinct six.

01:14:18.025 --> 01:14:19.860
Whitmire 300.

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:23.230
Hunter...

01:14:23.264 --> 01:14:24.565
90.

01:14:24.598 --> 01:14:26.000
The silent majority.

01:14:28.569 --> 01:14:30.503
Well...

01:14:38.045 --> 01:14:41.549
Anyway, they won't have
Hunter S. Thompson

01:14:41.582 --> 01:14:43.184
to kick around anymore.

01:14:43.751 --> 01:14:44.919
This is bullshit!

01:14:45.152 --> 01:14:46.253
No I wouldn't...

01:14:46.287 --> 01:14:47.855
Politics, you know?

01:14:49.190 --> 01:14:50.558
What do you
think you proved?

01:14:52.193 --> 01:14:55.062
I think, um,
I unfortunately proved

01:14:55.096 --> 01:14:57.064
what I set out to prove,

01:14:57.665 --> 01:15:01.135
which is that um,
you know,

01:15:01.168 --> 01:15:04.739
the American dream
really is fucked.

01:15:04.772 --> 01:15:05.906
No, it's not.

01:15:07.641 --> 01:15:08.909
Maybe I didn't prove that.

01:15:09.677 --> 01:15:11.679
Maybe I just proved, you know,

01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:13.881
there's no place in politics

01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:18.319
for a baldheaded lunatic, right?

01:15:26.694 --> 01:15:28.295
We ran the county line

01:15:30.164 --> 01:15:37.038
between the necessity for
winning and the weird possibility

01:15:37.638 --> 01:15:41.175
that we could win
on our own terms.

01:15:43.911 --> 01:15:48.282
And that alone has made
this campaign

01:15:48.315 --> 01:15:50.117
worth all of the effort.

01:15:50.785 --> 01:15:51.786
All the effort.

01:15:55.723 --> 01:15:58.826
I won't dwell on the past

01:15:59.260 --> 01:16:02.663
but just to say that

01:16:03.931 --> 01:16:06.934
this is the best piece of advice
I'll ever give you:

01:16:08.636 --> 01:16:12.006
if you ever get
a chance to sweep

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:13.774
the fat backs off their feet,

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:22.216
don't fuck it up.

01:16:32.726 --> 01:16:34.395
We won, we won, we won!

01:16:34.428 --> 01:16:36.664
<i>In a democracy,
people usually get</i>

01:16:36.997 --> 01:16:38.299
<i>the kind of
government they deserve</i>

01:16:38.332 --> 01:16:40.067
<i>and they deserve
what they get.</i>

01:16:40.201 --> 01:16:42.036
We love this town!

01:16:42.069 --> 01:16:44.638
<i>Winning this election,
party lines didn't really</i>

01:16:44.672 --> 01:16:46.073
mean much in this county.

01:16:46.107 --> 01:16:49.110
We realized that laws,
we must have laws,

01:16:49.143 --> 01:16:51.245
and we've got to obey these laws

01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:53.214
and without laws
we've got anarchy.

01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:55.649
- To Aspen.
- To Aspen.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.652
<i>The day after the polls close,</i>

01:16:58.686 --> 01:17:01.222
<i>you can understand
why Cinderella</i>

01:17:01.255 --> 01:17:02.923
<i>never stayed out
after midnight.</i>

01:17:05.259 --> 01:17:08.129
<i>Politics is the art of
controlling your environment.</i>

01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:12.299
<i>That is one of the key things
I learned in these years</i>

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.934
<i>and I learned it the hard way.</i>

01:17:15.202 --> 01:17:16.203
Yeah!

01:17:17.606 --> 01:17:18.672
<i>Anybody who thinks that it
doesn't matter who's president</i>

01:17:18.706 --> 01:17:21.108
<i>has never been sent off
to fight and die</i>

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:23.944
<i>in a vicious, stupid war on
the other side of the world,</i>

01:17:25.112 --> 01:17:27.281
<i>or been beaten and
gassed by police</i>

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:29.350
<i>for trespassing on
public property,</i>

01:17:30.217 --> 01:17:33.387
<i>or been hounded by the IRS for
purely political reasons,</i>

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:35.322
<i>or locked up in
the Cook County jail</i>

01:17:35.356 --> 01:17:37.925
<i>with a broken nose and
no phone access</i>

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:40.761
<i>and 12 perverts waiting to
stomp your ass in the shower.</i>

01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:42.897
<i>That is when it matters
who is president</i>

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:44.932
<i>or governor or Sheriff.</i>

01:17:45.766 --> 01:17:48.435
<i>That is when you wish
you had voted.</i>
