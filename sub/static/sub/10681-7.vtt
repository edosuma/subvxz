08:24.409 --> 08:25.376
Look at that.

08:25.410 --> 08:26.844
That's it, man.

08:26.878 --> 08:29.346
Mike, this is as close
to a complete Maskatron.

08:29.381 --> 08:31.148
We've never seen one
come into the store.

08:31.182 --> 08:32.515
No, never.

08:32.551 --> 08:34.284
Mind if I take it for a spin?

08:34.318 --> 08:35.653
- Sure. Go for it.
- All right.

08:35.687 --> 08:38.054
One minute, he's the evil cyborg.

08:38.089 --> 08:39.490
- Okay.
- Poom!

08:39.524 --> 08:41.225
- He's a bad guy.
- He's evil.

08:41.259 --> 08:43.294
Hence the eyebrows.

08:43.328 --> 08:44.361
Bam!

08:44.396 --> 08:46.163
He's your boss.

08:46.197 --> 08:47.798
[laughing] He's... he's my grandpa...

08:47.832 --> 08:48.899
[laughter]

08:48.934 --> 08:51.068
Telling me boring stories.

08:51.102 --> 08:52.703
Bang!

08:52.737 --> 08:55.573
He's the greatest astronaut/spy

08:55.607 --> 08:57.174
the world has ever seen.

08:59.110 --> 09:00.177
Oh, my...

09:00.211 --> 09:01.879
Maskatron.

09:01.913 --> 09:04.715
"The Six Million Dollar
Man's" true supervillain...

09:04.749 --> 09:06.584
His Lex Luthor, if you will...

09:06.618 --> 09:08.986
Who never appeared on
the television show.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.322
"Six Million Dollar Man" had
this brilliant concept of,

09:11.356 --> 09:14.191
like, he's Superman
with nobody to fight.

09:14.225 --> 09:15.225
[laughter]

09:15.260 --> 09:17.061
He had no villain, right?

09:17.095 --> 09:20.230
So Maskatron, they added to the
doll line because they're like,

09:20.265 --> 09:22.032
"I don't know how you guys do it on TV.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.368
We can't sell a doll
don't fight another doll."

09:24.402 --> 09:26.337
[laughter]

09:26.371 --> 09:28.405
Where did you get this stuff from?

09:28.440 --> 09:31.508
I run an online store:
vintage toys, video games.

09:31.543 --> 09:33.844
Bought these from different
collectors and stuff.

09:33.878 --> 09:35.446
Does he shoot anything?

09:35.480 --> 09:36.847
- That's right. Don't...
- Yeah.

09:36.881 --> 09:38.616
He would be able to shoot his arms.

09:38.650 --> 09:40.517
- Hit these things.
- Everybody get ready.

09:40.552 --> 09:42.419
Careful now.

09:42.454 --> 09:44.088
- [plastic clicks]
- Oh, yeah.

09:44.122 --> 09:45.122
- There you go.
- [laughs]

09:45.156 --> 09:46.357
You never forget.

09:46.391 --> 09:47.625
It's like riding a bike, man.

09:47.659 --> 09:49.426
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

09:49.461 --> 09:50.461
There you go.

09:50.495 --> 09:51.528
[laughing]

09:51.563 --> 09:53.230
[laughing]

09:53.264 --> 09:56.600
Not many toys you could fire the limbs.

09:56.635 --> 09:59.136
See, it's too bad it's
not anatomically correct

09:59.170 --> 10:01.238
so you could fire that
other missile somewhere.

10:01.272 --> 10:03.574
[laughter]

10:03.608 --> 10:04.975
I gotta know.

10:05.010 --> 10:06.777
What are you looking to get for it?

10:06.811 --> 10:09.380
How, uh... How's $150 sound?

10:09.414 --> 10:11.248
[sighs]

10:11.282 --> 10:12.616
Are these even Maskatron's clothes?

10:12.651 --> 10:14.051
They are.

10:14.085 --> 10:15.719
But, these are really
stained, unfortunately

10:15.754 --> 10:17.588
and they're also missing the buttons.

10:17.622 --> 10:19.923
Like, this right up here, and
that's what collectors look for.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.258
You gotta take some money off for that.

10:21.292 --> 10:23.394
- Yeah.
- You got to.

10:23.428 --> 10:25.095
How about $125?

10:25.130 --> 10:27.164
Look at this. This is broken.

10:27.198 --> 10:28.232
Was there a piece there at one time?

10:28.266 --> 10:29.767
There was.

10:29.801 --> 10:31.669
There's one of these.
Uh, the plastic pieces.

10:31.703 --> 10:33.737
I'm thinking...

10:33.772 --> 10:35.439
60 bucks.

10:35.473 --> 10:36.607
Uh... [sighs]

10:36.641 --> 10:38.008
Let me get $100.

10:38.043 --> 10:40.678
$75. I mean, that is extremely fair.

10:40.712 --> 10:43.514
As you said yourself, you
haven't had one come in here.

10:43.548 --> 10:45.149
I shouldn't have said that.

10:45.183 --> 10:46.684
[laughs]

10:46.718 --> 10:49.920
If you do $80, we got a deal.

10:49.954 --> 10:51.455
All right. 80 bucks.

10:51.489 --> 10:52.523
- Okay.
- You got yourself a deal.

10:52.557 --> 10:53.791
All right.

10:53.825 --> 10:56.527
[register clicking, whirring]

10:56.561 --> 10:57.528
Thanks, bro.

10:57.562 --> 10:58.829
Yep. I appreciate it.

10:58.863 --> 11:00.698
Good luck with the rest of your box.

11:00.732 --> 11:03.600
That's why this job is a job that

11:03.635 --> 11:06.103
you don't need to drink;
you don't need to do drugs.

11:06.137 --> 11:08.105
Because on any given day,

11:08.139 --> 11:09.506
you could find something like this,

11:09.541 --> 11:14.378
and your pulse rate
can go from zero to 60.

11:14.412 --> 11:15.879
- [laughs]
- Would that be...

11:15.914 --> 11:17.214
Would that be considered
fa... a fast pulse?

11:17.248 --> 11:18.549
Well, zero... That would be amazing.

11:18.583 --> 11:19.817
'Cause zero, you would be dead.

11:19.851 --> 11:21.685
- [laughter]
- You know what I mean.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.320
You're saying it could bring
you back to life, actually.

11:23.354 --> 11:24.521
[laughter]

11:24.556 --> 11:26.724
Can I see you become the demon?

11:26.758 --> 11:30.661
Is to lead his lambs to slaughter!

11:30.695 --> 11:32.029
Cross your eyes. Cross your eyes.

11:32.063 --> 11:33.063
Cross your eyes.

11:34.717 --> 11:36.952
Do you remember the first time

11:36.986 --> 11:39.120
you sat down to record
"Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!"?

11:39.155 --> 11:40.255
You were all together.

11:40.289 --> 11:42.624
- Yeah.
- Do you remember the first day?

11:42.658 --> 11:43.992
Like, "All right, we'll do this."

11:44.026 --> 11:46.065
And was there ever a thought of, like,

11:46.150 --> 11:48.885
it would lead or aggregate to this even?

11:48.919 --> 11:50.553
I do remember the first time,

11:50.588 --> 11:53.223
and Q for the first few
episodes said nothing.

11:53.257 --> 11:54.624
I didn't speak at all.

11:54.658 --> 11:55.792
Yeah, he was our tech guy.

11:55.826 --> 11:57.293
You were working the board?

11:57.328 --> 11:58.728
That was it.

11:58.763 --> 12:00.063
I had the headphones
on, and I was doing this.

12:00.097 --> 12:01.865
- I was going...
- [laughter]

12:01.899 --> 12:03.633
How many episodes
have you guys recorded?

12:03.667 --> 12:05.835
Over 260 episodes, I think.

12:05.870 --> 12:07.804
This coming from a dude who
was like, "I'll try it once."

12:07.838 --> 12:09.506
- Yeah.
- And many episodes in.

12:09.540 --> 12:11.374
Well, that's why Walt
agreed to it, I think,

12:11.408 --> 12:14.511
because since I quit
everything I start, he thought,

12:14.545 --> 12:16.479
"Eh, he'll do it for a
month, and that'll be it."

12:16.514 --> 12:17.647
He said it.

12:17.681 --> 12:19.215
He just like, "I'll do it,

12:19.250 --> 12:20.650
'cause he loses interest
like a five-year-old."

12:20.684 --> 12:22.418
And here we are on a TV show now.

12:22.453 --> 12:25.455
[laughter]

12:37.115 --> 12:38.965
Now, as you know, we are working on

12:38.965 --> 12:41.166
a Claymation movie for
"Tell 'Em Steve-Dave!"

12:41.200 --> 12:42.934
This is the most
important thing in my life

12:42.969 --> 12:45.003
I have family, and this is
more important than them.

12:45.038 --> 12:47.939
[laughter]

12:47.974 --> 12:50.509
It's the day of our auditions
to be the voice of Papa Blood,

12:50.543 --> 12:51.677
and we're all ready.

12:51.711 --> 12:53.245
We're very excited, of course.

12:53.279 --> 12:56.415
And, uh, you know, we got a
lot of familiar faces here.

12:56.449 --> 12:58.617
Cousin Johnny, thanks for coming in.

12:58.651 --> 12:59.685
All right.

12:59.719 --> 13:01.253
Nepotism means everything.

13:01.287 --> 13:02.587
That's the only reason I'm sitting here.

13:02.622 --> 13:04.222
- [laughter]
- Johnny did it?

13:04.257 --> 13:05.691
Let me tell you something
about my cousin Johnny.

13:05.725 --> 13:07.025
This kid's funny, man.

13:07.060 --> 13:08.060
You could see him in "Chasing Amy."

13:08.094 --> 13:09.594
That's right.

13:09.629 --> 13:11.463
He was in "Jay and Silent
Bob Strike Back" too.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.098
He was the guy that was just
like, "Ah, keep on truckin',"

13:13.132 --> 13:14.733
you know, in the baby
scene in the beginning.

13:14.767 --> 13:15.867
Hey, Jeff?

13:15.902 --> 13:17.569
We're ready.

13:17.603 --> 13:18.704
Thanks for coming by, Sunday Jeff.

13:18.738 --> 13:19.938
No problem. My pleasure.

13:19.972 --> 13:21.306
Sunday Jeff:

13:21.340 --> 13:23.208
now, there's a hidden wealth of talent

13:23.242 --> 13:25.577
that's heretofore untapped, man.

13:25.611 --> 13:27.579
Because he only works on Sunday.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.448
[laughter]

13:29.482 --> 13:32.084
You will be playing
Father Blood in this scene.

13:32.118 --> 13:35.587
The most evil creation
since Lucifer himself.

13:35.621 --> 13:37.389
You're gonna have to dig deep,

13:37.423 --> 13:38.757
deep down,

13:38.791 --> 13:40.892
and find your inner demon.

13:40.927 --> 13:42.160
Do you have an inner demon?

13:42.195 --> 13:43.729
Oh, yes. Everybody does.

13:43.763 --> 13:45.230
I've got some darkness
that I can draw upon.

13:45.264 --> 13:46.498
- Yeah?
- Sure, sure.

13:46.532 --> 13:48.266
I have some very repressed memories.

13:48.301 --> 13:50.335
These aren't the screen-used
puppets, obviously.

13:50.369 --> 13:52.170
They're gonna look a little bit
better than this... not much.

13:52.205 --> 13:54.005
They're not gonna
have Red Hots for eyes.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.441
[laughter]

13:56.476 --> 14:00.011
So getting into the scene,
it's a Christmas Eve service.

14:00.046 --> 14:02.013
Pastor Applegate is up at the pulpit,

14:02.048 --> 14:04.750
and the doors bang open.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.952
Mama! A monster!

14:06.986 --> 14:10.188
And what of a witness
who uttereth falsehoods?

14:10.223 --> 14:12.457
That was your inner demon?

14:12.492 --> 14:13.992
- Deeper voice, higher
voice: what do you want?

14:14.026 --> 14:15.594
Something you think
the devil sounds like.

14:15.628 --> 14:16.995
All right.

14:17.029 --> 14:18.630
[gravelly voice] And what of witness

14:18.664 --> 14:21.032
who uttereth falsehoods?

14:21.067 --> 14:22.267
Good. Good.

14:22.301 --> 14:23.335
[lilting voice] Fall away, demon!

14:23.369 --> 14:24.870
A blackened soul in this place

14:24.904 --> 14:26.972
is heresy of the darkest kind.

14:27.006 --> 14:28.774
[laughter]

14:28.808 --> 14:31.843
Papa Blood continues
walking towards Applegate.

14:31.878 --> 14:36.214
Or one who soweth
discord among brethren?

14:36.249 --> 14:38.316
Discord among breath-en?

14:38.351 --> 14:40.118
- [sputters]
- It's "brethren."

14:40.153 --> 14:41.453
Breath-en?

14:41.487 --> 14:43.054
[laughter]

14:43.089 --> 14:45.857
I am an ordained voice
of the Almighty, I am.

14:45.892 --> 14:47.192
Uh... [laughs]

14:47.226 --> 14:49.461
All right. All right. My bad. My bad.

14:49.495 --> 14:51.963
[demonic voice] A
sheepherder of false hearts.

14:51.998 --> 14:53.298
A little higher?

14:53.332 --> 14:57.702
And you, the cowing dutiful sheep

14:57.737 --> 14:59.771
of the charlatan!

15:01.541 --> 15:05.677
It was as if a demon was sitting in...

15:05.711 --> 15:07.012
On the other side of the table.

15:07.046 --> 15:08.980
I mean, he... It was intimidating.

15:09.015 --> 15:10.549
It was unsettling.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.517
More so than usual when Robert's...

15:12.552 --> 15:14.486
[laughter]

15:14.520 --> 15:16.221
Papa turns toward the congregation.

15:16.255 --> 15:18.924
And you, the core...

15:18.958 --> 15:20.058
Sorry.

15:20.092 --> 15:22.327
And you, the cowing...

15:22.361 --> 15:23.595
Bring it to life before us.

15:23.629 --> 15:26.031
Dutiful sheep...

15:26.065 --> 15:28.767
Dutiful sheep of a charlatan?

15:28.801 --> 15:30.869
Cowering dutiful sheep of a charlatan?

15:30.903 --> 15:32.237
[high-pitched voice] Leave us alone.

15:32.271 --> 15:34.172
We're not sheep! We're not!

15:34.207 --> 15:35.774
You want to go guttural.

15:35.808 --> 15:40.579
Hush and learn that the
nature of the sheepherder...

15:40.613 --> 15:42.714
[deep voice] Is to lead
his lambs to slaughter.

15:42.748 --> 15:44.049
I wouldn't mind if I could

15:44.083 --> 15:45.050
just give you a little direction.

15:45.084 --> 15:46.251
Sure. Absolutely.

15:46.285 --> 15:48.420
Can I see you become the demon?

15:48.454 --> 15:52.524
[garbled voice] Is to lead
his lambs to slaughter!

15:52.558 --> 15:53.692
Cross your eyes. Cross your eyes.

15:53.726 --> 15:54.960
Cross your eyes.

15:54.994 --> 15:56.461
One thing I did not see coming

15:56.495 --> 16:01.032
was how impressed with Mike I was.

16:01.067 --> 16:02.634
And nothing against... Nothing against;

16:02.668 --> 16:04.536
I just didn't know
whether you had it in you,

16:04.570 --> 16:05.637
and I was blown away.

16:05.671 --> 16:06.938
Thank you.

16:06.973 --> 16:08.473
So few compliments start out with,

16:08.507 --> 16:09.741
like, "I didn't think
you had any talent."

16:09.775 --> 16:12.210
[laughter]

16:12.245 --> 16:13.278
Hush, little one...

16:13.312 --> 16:14.779
[laughs]

16:14.814 --> 16:18.483
And learn of the nature
of the sheepherder

16:18.517 --> 16:23.154
is to lead his lambs to slaughter.

16:23.189 --> 16:24.923
[laughs drily]

16:24.957 --> 16:26.157
He surprised me.

16:26.192 --> 16:28.560
He brought a disturbed

16:28.594 --> 16:31.496
and jarring Ming Chen to the table.

16:31.530 --> 16:33.331
That's not the face of disturbed.

16:33.366 --> 16:35.433
Look. [laughter]

16:35.468 --> 16:37.168
[applause]

16:37.203 --> 16:38.336
- Wow.
- Wow.

16:38.371 --> 16:39.738
- Whoo!
- Wow.

16:39.772 --> 16:41.306
That was a pretty strong performance.

16:41.340 --> 16:42.974
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

16:43.009 --> 16:44.576
We appreciate it.

16:44.610 --> 16:45.977
Not even a thank you?

16:46.012 --> 16:48.413
Thank you for what, wasting our time?

16:48.447 --> 16:49.681
[laughter]

16:49.715 --> 16:50.815
Who's going to get the role?

16:50.850 --> 16:52.584
Who are you gonna cast?

16:52.618 --> 16:54.386
So we narrow it down to two.

17:01.609 --> 17:04.210
Hey, if they discovered a
pill that would allow males

17:04.244 --> 17:06.813
to give birth, would you guys take it?

17:06.847 --> 17:09.316
No, but I would certainly
slip it in their drinks.

17:09.349 --> 17:10.983
[laughter]

17:11.018 --> 17:12.586
There would be nothing better

17:12.619 --> 17:14.588
than seeing these two come in to work.

17:14.622 --> 17:16.021
[laughter]

17:16.057 --> 17:17.357
Oh, and take the pill and then...

17:17.391 --> 17:18.925
How do you...

17:18.960 --> 17:20.560
Now he's asking you
for the science of it.

17:20.595 --> 17:21.560
It just happens. It just happens.

17:21.596 --> 17:22.929
Okay.

17:22.964 --> 17:24.230
You wouldn't just take the pill

17:24.265 --> 17:25.498
and you become pregnant immediately.

17:25.532 --> 17:26.499
You still need to find a partner.

17:26.534 --> 17:28.034
Right. [laughter]

17:28.069 --> 17:30.236
Okay, no, I just wanted
to know either way.

17:30.271 --> 17:31.571
I think I could do it.

17:31.606 --> 17:32.572
Whether or not I would want to do it

17:32.607 --> 17:34.374
is the question.

17:34.408 --> 17:36.543
Okay, I mean, I would take
that pill in a heartbeat, man.

17:36.577 --> 17:37.544
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.212
And actually, I hope for twins.

17:39.246 --> 17:40.280
[laughs]

17:40.314 --> 17:41.548
Octodad 'em.

17:41.582 --> 17:43.550
[laughter]

17:43.584 --> 17:44.784
What about you, Mike? Come on.

17:44.819 --> 17:46.119
- No, I...
- No?

17:46.153 --> 17:47.420
No, I'm too old to have a kid.

17:47.455 --> 17:48.455
No, you're not.

17:48.489 --> 17:49.456
Look at those hips.

17:49.490 --> 17:50.557
You're a total MILF.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.393
[laughter]

17:53.427 --> 17:54.461
Mike I'd Like to...

17:54.495 --> 17:58.098
[laughter]

17:58.132 --> 17:59.432
Come on. Take the pill.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.948

18:14.982 --> 18:17.584
you know, we had a lot to go over.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.152
A lot of good candidates

18:19.186 --> 18:21.154
to be the voice of Papa Blood.

18:21.188 --> 18:23.456
The hardest decision is,
who's going to get the role?

18:23.491 --> 18:25.158
Who are you gonna cast?

18:25.192 --> 18:27.927
So we narrow it down to two.

18:27.962 --> 18:29.562
Here we go.

18:29.597 --> 18:31.264
- I got these two.
- Mike or Robert?

18:31.298 --> 18:32.899
Definitely has going against him

18:32.933 --> 18:34.668
a giant calculator watch.

18:34.702 --> 18:36.069
We'll give him Edward Scissors' voice.

18:36.103 --> 18:37.837
Okay, you're right.

18:37.872 --> 18:38.905
Out of the two,

18:38.939 --> 18:39.906
I say Mike.

18:39.940 --> 18:41.775
What do you say, Q?

18:41.809 --> 18:43.610
When I think we're gonna get
the commitment to the role,

18:43.644 --> 18:46.913
I think he's going to live as a demon

18:46.947 --> 18:49.182
the entire time we need him doing it.

18:49.216 --> 18:50.417
I think he is gonna be that dedicated.

18:50.451 --> 18:51.651
So you're for Robert.

18:51.686 --> 18:52.652
I'm for Rob Bruce.

18:52.687 --> 18:54.688
It's your call now.

18:54.722 --> 18:56.656
- Mike or Robert?
- [sighs]

You guys'll still be friends.

18:58.325 --> 19:00.126
Okay, I'd hate to destroy the friendship

19:03.364 --> 19:04.698
So what happened?

19:04.732 --> 19:06.499
Who's gonna be the
voice of Father Blood?

19:06.534 --> 19:07.834
I'll show you the teaser trailer.

19:07.868 --> 19:09.202
There's a teaser trailer already?

You guys really do work backwards, man.

19:12.339 --> 19:13.773
You got to make the movie, generally,
