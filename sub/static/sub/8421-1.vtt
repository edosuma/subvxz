00:25.040 --> 00:28.954
Nants ingonyama

00:29.040 --> 00:30.474
Bagithi baba

00:30.560 --> 00:33.394
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama

00:33.480 --> 00:35.995
Ingonyama

00:36.080 --> 00:38.959
What's on the menu?

00:39.040 --> 00:40.838
It could be ceviche

00:40.920 --> 00:44.038
Stinky-oo, it's Pumbaa

00:44.120 --> 00:45.600
Ingonyama

00:45.680 --> 00:47.319
I got to tell you, Timon.

00:47.400 --> 00:50.199
That song always
gets me right here.

00:50.280 --> 00:51.680
Yeah, Pumbaa.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.554
Well, enough of that.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.838
Timon,
what are you doing?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.310
I'm fast forwarding
to the part where we come in.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.756
But you can't go
out of order.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.797
Au contraire,
my porcine pal.

01:04.879 --> 01:06.633
I've got the remote.

01:06.720 --> 01:09.599
But everyone's going
to get confused.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.149
We got to go back to
the beginning of the story.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.472
We're not in
the beginning of the story.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.359
Yes, we were--
the whole time.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.882
Yeah, but
they don't know that.

01:20.883 --> 01:23.193
Then why don't we
tell them our story?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.759
Hey, I've got an idea.

01:27.843 --> 01:29.038
Why don't we tell them
our story?

01:29.123 --> 01:31.479
I like the sound of that.

01:31.563 --> 01:33.156
A little backstage tour.

01:33.243 --> 01:36.919
Take them behind the scenes for
a revealing and intimate look...

01:37.003 --> 01:38.960
at the story
within the story.

01:39.043 --> 01:41.433
Because what they don't know
is how we really were there...

01:41.523 --> 01:42.957
even though they didn't know
we were there, you know?

01:43.043 --> 01:44.921
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

01:45.003 --> 01:47.757
So, does this mean we're
going back to the beginning?

01:47.843 --> 01:49.357
Oh, no, Pumbaa, no.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.486
We're going way back...

01:51.487 --> 01:54.321
to before the beginning.

02:06.367 --> 02:09.007
Pride Rock.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.886
So majestic.

02:11.967 --> 02:14.277
So powerful.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.519
So bizarrely named.

02:17.607 --> 02:19.758
Pumbaa, how can
a rock be proud?

02:19.847 --> 02:20.917
It's a rock.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.566
Well, I think
it's because a pride...

02:22.647 --> 02:24.206
is what they call
a group of lions.

02:24.287 --> 02:26.961
Sure, the lions
get Pride Rock.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.640
And what about us meerkats?

02:28.727 --> 02:31.117
Where I come from, we didn't
have nothing to be proud of.

02:31.207 --> 02:33.039
Why...

02:33.127 --> 02:36.962
When I was
a young meerkat

02:37.047 --> 02:42.327
When he was
a young meerkat

02:42.407 --> 02:43.761
Very nice.
Thanks.

02:44.227 --> 02:45.997
But maybe it would be safer...

02:46.087 --> 02:47.919
if I just show them
where I came from.

02:48.007 --> 02:50.363
Oh, boy! Do we get to
see where you grew up?

02:50.447 --> 02:52.837
Yeah, Pumbaa,
but it ain't pretty.

02:52.927 --> 02:55.487
Please remain seated while
the camera is in motion.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.604
Here we are.

03:09.207 --> 03:11.881
From Pride Rock
to the pit of shame.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.880
We're so low on the food
chain, we're underground.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.924
But you don't have
to take my word for it.

03:17.007 --> 03:19.567
I'll just let my fellow
meerkats do the talking.

03:19.647 --> 03:20.922
What was that,
what was what?

03:21.007 --> 03:22.441
What was that,
what was that?

03:22.527 --> 03:24.007
Where, what, where, where,
what was that?

03:24.087 --> 03:25.919
Shh!

03:26.007 --> 03:29.444
Quick,
before the hyena come

03:29.527 --> 03:30.597
Clear.

03:33.167 --> 03:35.477
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

03:35.567 --> 03:37.923
When you're done,
you dig a bigger tunnah

03:38.007 --> 03:40.078
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

03:42.012 --> 03:44.971
Dig, digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

03:45.052 --> 03:46.964
You could dig
and never get done

03:47.052 --> 03:48.771
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

03:48.852 --> 03:51.367
What was that?

03:51.452 --> 03:54.012
Quick before
the hyena come, dig

03:54.092 --> 03:56.368
Digga tunnah is what we do

03:56.452 --> 03:58.011
Life's a tunnah
we're diggin' through

03:58.092 --> 04:00.732
Digga tunnah
is what we sing

04:00.812 --> 04:03.043
Digga tunnah
is everything

04:03.132 --> 04:05.408
Mud and clay
is a meerkat's friend

04:05.492 --> 04:07.688
Always more
around every bend

04:07.772 --> 04:09.843
And when you get
to your tunnah's end

04:12.736 --> 04:14.648
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

04:14.736 --> 04:16.932
When it's done,
you dig a bigger tunnah

04:17.016 --> 04:18.769
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

04:18.856 --> 04:21.325
What was that?

04:21.416 --> 04:23.214
Quick,
before the hyena come

04:23.296 --> 04:24.412
Dig

04:24.496 --> 04:26.453
Timon! Excuse me.

04:26.536 --> 04:28.732
Have you seen my son?
Has he been through here?

04:28.816 --> 04:30.091
Timon!

04:30.176 --> 04:31.451
Dig, digga tunnah

04:31.536 --> 04:33.687
Uncle Max?

04:33.776 --> 04:36.496
Uncle Max, relax.
Have you seen Timon?

04:36.576 --> 04:39.330
No, I haven't, and
what a day it's been.

04:39.416 --> 04:41.328
No fractures,
no lacerations...

04:41.416 --> 04:44.295
no concussions, contusions,
or injuries of any sort.

04:44.376 --> 04:45.856
As a matter of fact...

04:45.936 --> 04:50.488
there's no sign of Timon's
handiwork anywhere.

04:56.736 --> 04:58.728
That would be...

04:58.816 --> 05:01.729
Timon!

05:04.736 --> 05:06.011
Hey, everybody.

05:06.096 --> 05:08.133
Nice work, Timon.

05:08.216 --> 05:10.208
Way to go, tunnel klutz.

05:10.296 --> 05:11.776
Who else could break a hole?

05:11.856 --> 05:13.973
Four in one week--
a new record.

05:14.056 --> 05:15.615
Not again.

05:15.696 --> 05:18.530
What?
It's called a skylight.

05:24.056 --> 05:26.287
Wow. Isn't that creative?

05:26.376 --> 05:29.016
A skylight.

05:30.456 --> 05:32.891
I'll just have
a word with him.

05:32.976 --> 05:34.933
I was just trying
to shed a little light...

05:35.016 --> 05:37.576
on our pathetic existence.

05:37.656 --> 05:40.569
Timon, this can't go on.

05:40.656 --> 05:43.615
Just this month,
you've pulled down four walls...

05:43.696 --> 05:46.495
and collapsed
two tunnel exits.

05:46.576 --> 05:48.408
We have to look after
each other.

05:48.496 --> 05:49.850
Our survival depends on it.

05:49.936 --> 05:52.212
What's the point?
All we do is dig...

05:52.296 --> 05:55.016
so we can hide,
and hide so we can dig.

05:56.656 --> 05:59.330
I want to be where we don't
have to dig tunnels...

05:59.416 --> 06:01.692
and live with our heads
stuck in the sand.

06:01.776 --> 06:04.814
What's so bad about
dreaming of a better home?

06:04.896 --> 06:07.365
I want to show you something.

06:07.456 --> 06:10.290
Look, Timon.

06:10.376 --> 06:12.652
Go on, look.

06:12.736 --> 06:15.615
Look out to the horizon--

06:15.696 --> 06:18.131
past the trees...

06:18.216 --> 06:21.175
over the grasslands.

06:21.256 --> 06:25.489
Everything
the light touches...

06:25.576 --> 06:27.647
belongs to someone else.

06:29.496 --> 06:30.817
Funny.
I thought you were going...

06:30.856 --> 06:32.449
a whole different
direction with this.

06:32.536 --> 06:34.289
What can I say?
It's nature's design.

06:34.376 --> 06:36.368
She's right.
We're food for other animals--

06:36.456 --> 06:37.685
a moveable feast...

06:37.776 --> 06:40.336
feared by no one
and eaten by all.

06:40.416 --> 06:43.056
But when they die,
they become the grass...

06:43.136 --> 06:45.571
and we eat the grass, right?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.329
Not exactly.
We can't digest grass.

06:47.416 --> 06:48.566
We're grass intolerant.

06:48.656 --> 06:50.295
OK, Max. Thank you.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.492
You've been a big help.

06:51.576 --> 06:53.693
Meerkat--it's
what's for dinner.

06:53.776 --> 06:55.529
Thank you, Uncle Max.

06:57.176 --> 07:00.886
I think Uncle Max dislodged one
too many rocks with his skull.

07:00.976 --> 07:03.093
But he's right, Timon.

07:03.176 --> 07:08.205
Oh, I just know there's a way
for you to fit in here.

07:12.376 --> 07:14.333
Alright,
who's on sentry duty?

07:14.416 --> 07:16.009
That's it.

07:16.096 --> 07:19.009
That's it--my son
on sentry duty.

07:19.096 --> 07:21.565
Timon the sentry.

07:21.656 --> 07:23.090
Timon the sentry?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.896
Why don't you save
the hyenas the trouble...

07:24.936 --> 07:27.690
and kill me now?
Just kill me now.

07:27.776 --> 07:28.892
He has a point.

07:28.976 --> 07:31.252
All you have to do
is watch for hyenas...

07:31.336 --> 07:32.486
and yell if you see one.

07:32.576 --> 07:34.090
Look at Iron Joe.

07:34.176 --> 07:35.696
Don't close your eyes!
Don't look away!

07:35.736 --> 07:36.886
Somebody's gotta guard us!

07:36.976 --> 07:38.535
Somebody's gotta protect us!

07:41.416 --> 07:43.726
Well, now I'm convinced.

07:43.816 --> 07:45.489
Listen, it's outside...

07:45.576 --> 07:47.932
up in the breeze,
under the wide open sky.

07:48.016 --> 07:49.052
Isn't that what you want?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.650
Or maybe you would
rather have him...

07:50.736 --> 07:52.056
go back on the digging crew.

07:52.136 --> 07:53.775
No!

07:56.376 --> 07:58.015
Good, then we all agree.

07:58.096 --> 07:59.769
Timon, listen to Uncle Max.

07:59.856 --> 08:01.893
He'll teach you
everything you need to know.

08:01.976 --> 08:04.855
And, honey,
try to make this one work.

08:05.016 --> 08:07.929
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

08:08.016 --> 08:10.212
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

08:10.296 --> 08:12.731
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

08:12.816 --> 08:14.489
Good. Now...

08:14.576 --> 08:17.967
what do we do
if we see a hyena?

08:18.056 --> 08:19.126
Scream, "Mommy"?

08:20.660 --> 08:22.811
because the world out there
is fraught with danger.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.254
Fraught, I tell you!

08:24.340 --> 08:26.491
Oh, boy.
It's the fraught fest.

08:26.580 --> 08:27.616
...rip us limb from limb.

08:27.700 --> 08:29.453
Bravo, Uncle Max.

08:29.540 --> 08:31.054
Way to sell it
to the cheap seats.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.371
Applaud now, sonny boy,
but try clapping...

08:33.460 --> 08:37.010
when you don't have any hands.

08:39.340 --> 08:41.616
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.496
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

08:53.064 --> 08:54.703
I like the sound of that.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.299
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

08:58.384 --> 09:00.182
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

09:01.184 --> 09:03.494
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.224
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

09:06.304 --> 09:08.978
There's more to life
than panic

09:09.064 --> 09:12.182
And bein' some other guy's
snack, yuck

09:12.264 --> 09:14.620
I may be delicious
organic

09:14.704 --> 09:18.493
But this little entree's
fighting back

09:18.584 --> 09:21.418
I'm gonna put
digging tunnels behind me

09:21.504 --> 09:24.144
And live
at a new altitude

09:24.224 --> 09:27.058
I'm gonna reach for
the stars to remind me

09:27.144 --> 09:30.501
That meerkats
are not merely food

09:30.588 --> 09:34.423
For once I'll be

09:34.508 --> 09:37.103
Lookin' out for me

09:39.988 --> 09:42.423
Yeah, I'll tell you
what I want

09:42.508 --> 09:43.942
This cat is movin' on

09:44.028 --> 09:46.463
He's a bon vivant
who's missin' out on bon

09:46.548 --> 09:49.302
I'd be a bigger cheese
far from the desert scene

09:49.388 --> 09:52.187
A little cooling breeze,
a little patch of green

09:52.268 --> 09:53.463
And I'll be snoozing
in my hammock

09:53.548 --> 09:55.062
By a rippling stream

09:55.148 --> 09:57.708
Many miles from any tunnel
and the digging team

09:57.788 --> 10:00.462
Looking after number one
will be my only creed

10:03.436 --> 10:06.270
That's all I need

10:06.356 --> 10:09.076
I've always been good
at running away

10:09.156 --> 10:12.069
Well, now
I'm gonna run the show

10:12.156 --> 10:14.512
I've always been seen
as the ultimate prey

10:14.596 --> 10:16.827
But now my status
ain't so quo

10:16.916 --> 10:19.875
A dream sublime

10:19.956 --> 10:23.506
It's hyena time--

10:23.596 --> 10:25.394
Oh, look, it's dinner
and a show.

10:25.476 --> 10:28.389
And I thought beans
were the only musical food.

10:28.476 --> 10:31.196
Hy-hy-hy--

10:31.276 --> 10:32.915
Well, hi to you, too.

10:38.481 --> 10:40.598
This is no time
for horseplay, Timon.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.673
You're supposed to be up
there looking out for--

10:44.361 --> 10:45.920
Hyenas!

10:49.841 --> 10:51.480
Whoa, look at them scramble.

10:52.561 --> 10:55.360
And that's just
how I like them--

10:55.441 --> 10:56.955
scrambled...

10:58.001 --> 11:00.232
And a little bit runny.

11:00.321 --> 11:01.835
Hyenas!

11:10.641 --> 11:11.791
Get in here.

11:11.881 --> 11:13.634
What are you, a meshugginah?

11:20.361 --> 11:22.671
Stumpy? Flinchy? Swifty?

11:22.761 --> 11:24.275
What a relief.

11:24.361 --> 11:25.715
Everybody's--

11:25.801 --> 11:26.951
Where's Uncle Max?

11:31.721 --> 11:33.952
Max! Run for your life!

11:34.041 --> 11:36.158
- Play dead!
- ¡Andale!

11:36.241 --> 11:37.197
Almost there!

11:37.281 --> 11:39.477
Suede is the look
for this fall.

11:39.561 --> 11:40.836
Hey, what's going on?

11:40.921 --> 11:42.514
Pumbaa, you're sitting
on the remote.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.399
Oh, sorry.

11:44.481 --> 11:46.393
I thought it was a brownie.

11:46.481 --> 11:47.961
You've got it, Max!

11:54.401 --> 11:56.711
Max!

11:56.801 --> 12:00.431
I flinched when
I should've scurried.

12:00.601 --> 12:01.751
Oh, man.

12:01.841 --> 12:03.639
It just never gets old,
does it?

12:03.721 --> 12:05.713
The classics never do, honey.

12:13.321 --> 12:17.361
I guess I owe everyone
an apology.

12:17.441 --> 12:19.876
Alright, so I made
a teensy mistake.

12:19.961 --> 12:21.873
Like we all haven't
broken into song...

12:21.961 --> 12:23.554
on sentry duty before.

12:23.641 --> 12:24.870
Come on.

12:24.961 --> 12:27.112
Let me have a show of hands.

12:27.201 --> 12:28.521
OK.

12:33.001 --> 12:34.640
Maybe it's
a little too soon...

12:34.721 --> 12:37.680
but I'm sure we're all gonna
laugh about this someday.

12:37.761 --> 12:38.990
Trust me.

12:40.201 --> 12:42.921
I did trust you.

12:45.521 --> 12:46.875
But--

13:25.081 --> 13:26.879
Aw, sweetie...

13:26.961 --> 13:29.271
I'm never going
to fit in here.

13:29.361 --> 13:31.432
Nobody even likes me.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.638
Sure they do, honey.
Sure they do.

13:33.721 --> 13:35.360
Besides you, Ma.

13:35.441 --> 13:37.751
Besides me?
There's--

13:37.841 --> 13:41.278
I have to find my place,
but it isn't here.

13:41.361 --> 13:43.921
Yes, it is. We just
haven't found it yet.

13:44.001 --> 13:44.912
But we will.

13:45.001 --> 13:46.196
Here's an idea.
You can--

13:46.281 --> 13:47.954
Stop with the hair already.

13:48.041 --> 13:50.033
My place is out there, Ma.

13:50.121 --> 13:54.991
I may not know exactly where
or how far, but I got to go.

13:55.081 --> 13:56.879
No, wait.
I know. If we just--

13:56.961 --> 13:58.361
Ma.

14:08.521 --> 14:13.038
Well, I hope you find what
you're looking for, honey.

14:16.641 --> 14:18.678
I love you. Mmm!

14:18.761 --> 14:20.434
I love you, Ma.

14:26.241 --> 14:27.675
Oh, Timmy.

14:27.761 --> 14:29.241
My Timmy.

14:31.761 --> 14:32.672
Mom...

14:32.761 --> 14:33.672
choking.

14:33.761 --> 14:35.354
Not breathing.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.238
And people wonder
why I have issues.

14:41.321 --> 14:44.439
I'll be OK.

14:44.521 --> 14:47.832
I know you will.
You will.

15:01.761 --> 15:03.275
Be careful!

15:03.361 --> 15:05.000
I will.

15:06.441 --> 15:08.797
Don't talk to strangers!

15:08.881 --> 15:10.554
I know, Ma!

15:11.761 --> 15:14.435
Remember,
wash behind your ears!

15:14.521 --> 15:18.356
Ma, I'm not a kid anymore!

15:18.441 --> 15:20.194
Never go swimming
without a buddy!

15:20.281 --> 15:21.431
Got it.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.035
What?

15:30.681 --> 15:32.354
What?!

15:34.161 --> 15:37.040
Good-bye, Ma.

15:58.481 --> 16:01.201
And so,
with high spirits...

16:01.281 --> 16:03.159
I boldly ventured off...

16:03.241 --> 16:06.393
where no meerkat
had dared to go before.

16:06.481 --> 16:11.715
I put my past behind me,
and never looked back.

16:17.721 --> 16:19.474
Mommy! Mommy!

16:21.844 --> 16:25.963
What am I doing?

16:26.044 --> 16:28.115
Which way should I go?

16:28.204 --> 16:30.400
That depends on
what you think.

16:30.484 --> 16:31.918
How convenient.

16:32.004 --> 16:34.235
Enter omniscient monkey,
right on cue.

16:34.324 --> 16:36.077
Well, you know
what they say.

16:36.164 --> 16:39.202
When the student is ready,
the teacher appears.

16:39.284 --> 16:42.277
That's it. No more
fortune cookies for you.

16:42.364 --> 16:43.559
Hey, where'd you come from?

16:43.644 --> 16:47.524
The better question is,
where are you going?

16:47.604 --> 16:53.007
Someplace wonderful,
mister, where...

16:53.008 --> 16:54.203
You didn't happen to catch...

16:54.288 --> 16:56.041
the song I sang
a few minutes ago, did you?

16:56.128 --> 16:57.642
I didn't have the pleasure.

16:57.728 --> 17:02.120
To recap, I want to live in
some beautiful place outside...

17:02.208 --> 17:04.928
a carefree place where
I don't have to hide or worry.

17:07.127 --> 17:09.279
Life without worry.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.246
You seek hakuna matata.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.684
- Harpoon a tomato?
- Hakuna matata--

17:13.768 --> 17:15.327
it means "No worries."

17:15.407 --> 17:17.365
Perfect. Mind taking
that stick of yours...

17:17.448 --> 17:19.246
and drawing me a map, bub?

17:21.528 --> 17:26.284
To find it, you must look
beyond what you see.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.768
What the heck is that
supposed to mean?

17:27.848 --> 17:32.923
It means look beyond
what you see.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.079
Beyond what I see.

17:35.168 --> 17:36.761
Get a load
of the monkey...

17:36.848 --> 17:39.522
getting all
existential on me.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.487
Beyond what I see.

17:48.008 --> 17:51.399
Beyond what I see.

17:54.368 --> 17:56.724
Beyond what I see.

17:59.568 --> 18:02.367
It's kind of hard to think
with all this music.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.041
Beyond...

18:04.128 --> 18:05.562
what I see.

18:06.928 --> 18:09.079
Wait a second.

18:09.168 --> 18:11.000
It's coming to me.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.568
It's either
that slug I ate...

18:12.648 --> 18:14.162
or I'm having an epiphany.

18:16.688 --> 18:20.841
I'm going
to the big pointy rock!

18:20.928 --> 18:22.567
Right?

18:23.648 --> 18:26.527
Who was
that strange monkey?

18:26.608 --> 18:27.724
Ah, well.

18:27.808 --> 18:30.721
Dream home, here I come.

18:41.128 --> 18:42.357
Hello?

18:42.448 --> 18:45.122
Strange but wise monkey?

19:12.368 --> 19:15.247
You know, first impressions
are very important.

19:15.328 --> 19:17.001
I thought you were a scream.

19:19.088 --> 19:21.842
Just eat me now,
and please make it fast.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.487
I got a low threshold
for pain.

19:23.568 --> 19:25.560
Easy, easy there,
little guy.

19:25.648 --> 19:27.241
I'm not going
to eat you.

19:27.328 --> 19:29.718
What? You're not?

19:29.808 --> 19:31.447
Then why were you
stalking me?

19:33.732 --> 19:35.928
and I figured
a little fellow like you...

19:36.012 --> 19:37.082
shouldn't be out here
all alone.

19:37.172 --> 19:40.722
Hey, what about you?
You're all alone.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.531
You are all alone,
aren't you?

19:42.612 --> 19:43.807
Yeah.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.851
Most animals give me
a pretty wide berth.

19:46.932 --> 19:49.811
They do?
Even the hungry ones?

19:49.892 --> 19:52.532
Yeah. I drive
almost everyone away.

19:52.612 --> 19:55.252
People see me coming,
and they run for cover.

19:55.332 --> 19:57.403
They can't get out
of the way fast enough.

19:57.492 --> 19:59.484
You don't say,
you don't say.

19:59.572 --> 20:02.575
Must be the gleam
on those vicious tusks, huh?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.374
Strikes fear
into their hearts.

20:04.456 --> 20:07.654
Actually, they say
I wreck their appetite.

20:07.736 --> 20:11.571
Wow. It's like you have
this special power.

20:11.656 --> 20:13.090
Special power?

20:13.176 --> 20:17.056
Well, it's pretty
powerful, alright.

20:17.136 --> 20:18.365
Perfect. You're hired.

20:18.456 --> 20:20.846
Great! For what?

20:20.936 --> 20:23.053
To get me to a little
worry-free haven...

20:23.136 --> 20:26.652
out by that big pointy rock.

20:26.736 --> 20:29.570
And you want me
to come with you?

20:29.656 --> 20:32.091
Do you see
any other big lovable...

20:32.176 --> 20:33.405
chunk of warthog here...

20:33.496 --> 20:35.647
who also happens to have
razor-sharp tusks...

20:35.736 --> 20:37.887
and the ability
to repel predators?

20:37.976 --> 20:39.126
I'm your pig.

20:39.216 --> 20:42.288
You and me, I can tell--
we see eye to eye.

20:42.376 --> 20:44.845
You mean, like friends?

20:44.936 --> 20:46.450
Whoa, easy there, big fella.

20:46.536 --> 20:48.493
I'd say more like...

20:48.576 --> 20:50.374
acquaintances.

20:50.456 --> 20:53.176
Well, it's a start.

20:53.256 --> 20:54.736
Put 'er there, acquaintance.

20:54.816 --> 20:57.251
- I'm Timon.
- Pumbaa.

20:57.336 --> 20:58.326
No, really.

21:01.336 --> 21:03.612
Alright, then.
Let's hit the road.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.255
You got it...

21:05.336 --> 21:08.090
acquaintance.

21:08.176 --> 21:10.054
So, clear up
one thing for me.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.650
If you weren't
going to eat me...

21:11.736 --> 21:13.967
what kind of a wacky,
wild pig are you?

21:14.056 --> 21:15.570
I'm an insectivore.

21:15.656 --> 21:18.296
A bug eater.

21:18.376 --> 21:19.730
Well, me, too.

21:19.816 --> 21:21.569
I just never had
a name for it.

21:21.656 --> 21:24.046
I'm kind of partial to
the crawly critters myself.

21:24.136 --> 21:25.172
How about you, big boy?

21:25.256 --> 21:27.009
I prefer the ones
with wings.

21:27.096 --> 21:30.885
Pumbaa, this could be
the start of a beautiful...

21:30.976 --> 21:32.888
acquaintanceship.

21:42.536 --> 21:45.847
Nants ingonyama

21:45.936 --> 21:48.770
OK, so now we're
back at the beginning.

21:48.856 --> 21:49.972
Right, Timon?

21:50.056 --> 21:51.456
Oh, you got that right, pally.

21:51.536 --> 21:53.289
Ingonyama

21:53.376 --> 21:56.448
At last,
things were looking up.

21:56.536 --> 21:58.368
I had the sun
on my shoulders...

21:58.456 --> 21:59.890
the wind at my heels...

21:59.976 --> 22:01.535
a song in my heart.

22:08.056 --> 22:11.732
And to protect me,
a great big fat guy.

22:11.816 --> 22:13.808
You really think
I look fat?

22:13.896 --> 22:16.013
Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

22:16.096 --> 22:18.531
You're a pig.
It's a compliment.

22:18.616 --> 22:21.051
Thank you.

22:25.056 --> 22:29.892
It's the circle of life

22:29.976 --> 22:31.774
And it moves us all

22:31.856 --> 22:35.167
There it is--
the big pointy rock.

22:35.256 --> 22:37.930
Oh, baby,
we're almost there.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.728
I think we're a little late.

22:42.816 --> 22:46.014
It's a land rush.
That loudmouth monkey.

22:46.096 --> 22:48.292
He must've blabbed it
to the whole world.

22:48.376 --> 22:49.856
What exactly did he say?

22:49.936 --> 22:52.815
Look beyond what you see.

22:52.896 --> 22:55.331
So maybe you're supposed to
look beyond the big pointy rock.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.454
Maybe I'm supposed to look
beyond the big pointy rock.

22:58.536 --> 22:59.765
Well...

22:59.856 --> 23:01.609
let's have a little look,
shall we?

23:01.696 --> 23:03.767
Beyond what I see.

23:03.856 --> 23:06.655
Beyond what I see.

23:06.736 --> 23:09.456
Beyond what I see.

23:11.216 --> 23:12.775
What do you know?

23:12.856 --> 23:15.325
The monkey's got
an eagle eye for real estate!

23:15.416 --> 23:16.452
Timon, look!

23:16.536 --> 23:18.493
Hey! It's the monkey!

23:18.576 --> 23:19.896
What's that
he's holding up?

23:19.976 --> 23:21.854
Who cares?
It's not important.

23:21.936 --> 23:24.974
Come on!
My dream home awaits.

23:26.936 --> 23:30.327
I don't do
so well in crowds.

23:30.416 --> 23:32.328
Maybe we better
go around.

23:32.416 --> 23:33.936
Don't you know
the shortest distance...

23:34.016 --> 23:35.530
between me
and my dream home...

23:35.616 --> 23:37.926
is a straight line?
Follow me!

23:39.096 --> 23:40.132
Excuse me.

23:40.216 --> 23:42.128
Goodness.

23:42.216 --> 23:44.128
Make room, make room!

23:44.216 --> 23:45.969
Watch it, twiggy.

23:46.056 --> 23:47.649
I'm walkin' here!

23:58.816 --> 24:00.535
Timon!

24:00.616 --> 24:03.176
There's something
I gotta tell you.

24:03.256 --> 24:04.656
Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

24:04.736 --> 24:07.808
We'll have plenty of time
to chat once we settle in.

24:09.096 --> 24:11.133
I could really use
a rest stop.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.606
Don't worry.
You'll get your second wind.

24:13.696 --> 24:17.372
I got a really bad feeling!

24:17.456 --> 24:18.412
It'll pass!

24:18.496 --> 24:20.772
Trust me. It'll pass.

24:28.896 --> 24:30.853
Look,
the rhinos are bowing.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.848
We'd better bow, too.

24:41.416 --> 24:46.252
Look, sire, how they kneel
before the royal son.

24:53.936 --> 24:56.053
So, I guess that's
your special power, huh?

24:56.136 --> 24:57.775
What a weapon!

24:57.856 --> 25:00.132
You mean, you don't mind?

25:00.216 --> 25:01.809
Are you kidding?

25:01.896 --> 25:03.216
It was a gas!

25:04.616 --> 25:07.495
Well, I don't like
to toot my own horn.

25:07.576 --> 25:09.533
Yeah, that's probably
for the best.

25:10.576 --> 25:11.805
Let's go, Pumbaa!

25:11.896 --> 25:13.808
Lead the way!

25:22.456 --> 25:24.368
This is it, buddy boy.

25:24.456 --> 25:26.288
Home sweet home.

25:26.376 --> 25:28.732
And I don't gotta share
it with anybody.

25:28.816 --> 25:31.285
Don't you get, you know,
lonely out here?

25:31.376 --> 25:33.686
Lonely?
Try commitment-free.

25:33.776 --> 25:35.893
The elbow-to-elbow
life reminds me...

25:35.976 --> 25:37.251
a little too much of home.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.009
This place
has everything--

25:39.096 --> 25:41.531
cool refreshments,
cozy little hammock...

25:41.616 --> 25:45.166
a lovely water feature,
and it's all mine.

25:48.456 --> 25:52.086
Well, it's really
coming together, Timon...

25:52.176 --> 25:55.328
so, I guess
I'll just be going.

25:59.656 --> 26:01.887
Wait a minute, now. Wait.

26:01.976 --> 26:04.616
There's no law
that says you have to go.

26:04.696 --> 26:05.766
I mean,
if you want--

26:05.856 --> 26:08.166
Great! I already
made up two beds!

26:08.256 --> 26:09.895
One for you...

26:09.976 --> 26:11.968
and one for me.

26:21.056 --> 26:23.855
Gee, all this construction work
has me bushed.

26:23.936 --> 26:25.529
Think I'll turn in early.

26:48.780 --> 26:49.930
Good night!

26:50.020 --> 26:51.090
Sleep tight.

26:51.180 --> 26:52.660
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

26:59.300 --> 27:01.974
Home sweet home indeed.

27:24.984 --> 27:27.215
Hey, keep it down up there!

27:27.304 --> 27:29.660
We have neighbours?
We should go say hello.

27:29.744 --> 27:30.894
Noisy neighbours.

27:30.984 --> 27:33.021
There go
the property values.

27:33.104 --> 27:37.576
Let's hear it in the herd
and on the wing

27:37.664 --> 27:42.420
It's gonna be
King Simba's finest fling

27:42.504 --> 27:46.054
Oh, I just can't wait
to be king

27:46.144 --> 27:47.180
Oh, perfect.

27:47.264 --> 27:48.823
We moved to
the theater district.

27:48.904 --> 27:50.577
Get a load of these guys.

27:51.664 --> 27:52.654
Knock it off!

27:54.264 --> 27:55.778
Just can't wait

27:55.864 --> 27:57.537
Timon, look out!

27:57.624 --> 28:00.662
To be king

28:04.984 --> 28:06.862
I'm OK.

28:08.784 --> 28:10.298
Show people.

28:10.464 --> 28:11.659
Chin up, Pumbaa.

28:12.864 --> 28:15.174
Our dream home's
around here somewhere.

28:15.264 --> 28:17.540
You know, Timon,
I once came across a place...

28:17.624 --> 28:19.695
that might be just what
you're looking for.

28:19.784 --> 28:21.582
Spectacular waterfalls...

28:21.664 --> 28:24.020
set in a lush
tropical oasis...

28:24.104 --> 28:25.140
a scrumptious
array of--

28:25.224 --> 28:26.544
Hey, hey.
Forget it, Pumbaa.

28:26.624 --> 28:28.343
I'm a realist,
and I'm not gonna go...

28:28.424 --> 28:29.938
chasing after
some fantasy.

28:30.024 --> 28:32.095
I'm going beyond
what I see.

28:32.184 --> 28:34.335
But if you always go
beyond what you see...

28:35.708 --> 28:37.540
I'll tell you how I know.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.267
We're there!

28:44.868 --> 28:46.188
This is a lovely spot.

28:46.268 --> 28:48.066
Lovely, rustic, picturesque.

28:48.148 --> 28:50.026
Home sweet home, Pumbaa.

28:50.108 --> 28:51.508
Home sweet ho--

28:55.828 --> 28:57.148
I mean, sure...

28:57.228 --> 28:58.708
it needs a little work...

28:58.788 --> 29:00.859
but it's got good bones.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.621
After all...

29:02.708 --> 29:04.871
this is
an elephant graveyard...

29:04.872 --> 29:07.751
and who would ever come
to an elephant graveyard?

29:09.872 --> 29:11.989
Sire, the hyenas
are after the children!

29:15.032 --> 29:18.025
I see carnivores.

29:18.112 --> 29:19.546
Beyond what you see.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.988
Beyond what you see.

29:22.072 --> 29:23.222
Beyond what you see!

29:23.312 --> 29:25.508
Timon?
Would this be a bad time...

29:25.592 --> 29:27.345
to bring up that little place
I told you about?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.345
Hey! This is
home sweet home, baby!

29:30.432 --> 29:31.752
Home--

29:32.952 --> 29:35.751
Steam! Steam is good.

29:35.832 --> 29:39.587
Steam is water.
Gotta have water.

29:39.672 --> 29:41.186
You know,
for the dream home.

29:41.272 --> 29:42.308
Steam home, dream home.

29:42.392 --> 29:44.349
Steam, steam, steam.

29:44.432 --> 29:47.948
I am perfectly happy
right here!

29:48.032 --> 29:51.946
It's remote, private,
no unexpected visitors.

29:57.912 --> 29:59.426
Somethin' tells me
this ain't...

29:59.512 --> 30:01.868
the traveling company
of "Riverdance."

30:07.592 --> 30:09.231
Beyond what you see.

30:09.312 --> 30:11.144
Beyond what you--

30:11.232 --> 30:15.749
Hey, how am I supposed to look
beyond what I see beyond that?

30:16.912 --> 30:18.665
Sorry.

30:25.232 --> 30:27.428
What this place lacks
in water and shade...

30:27.512 --> 30:29.185
it makes up for
with searing heat...

30:29.272 --> 30:30.626
and blinding sunshine.

30:30.712 --> 30:32.066
Home sweet home, Pumbaa.

30:39.192 --> 30:41.388
Shall we run
for our lives?

30:41.472 --> 30:42.667
Oh, yes, let's.

31:00.312 --> 31:01.905
Hang on, Timon!

31:01.992 --> 31:03.585
This is it!

31:03.672 --> 31:06.187
Good-bye, cruel world!

31:16.592 --> 31:17.787
That's it?

31:17.872 --> 31:19.909
That wasn't so bad.

31:19.992 --> 31:23.064
You can't knock old
Timon down that easy!

31:23.152 --> 31:25.428
Yeah! Bring it on!

31:27.912 --> 31:29.392
Pumbaa?

31:29.472 --> 31:31.987
Question--
is it possible...

31:32.072 --> 31:33.631
to fall off
the edge of the earth?

31:33.712 --> 31:35.305
Technically, no.

31:35.392 --> 31:37.463
The earth is round
like a sphere, Timon...

31:37.552 --> 31:39.669
so it doesn't actually
have an edge.

31:48.032 --> 31:49.751
You mind if I pause it
for a second?

31:49.832 --> 31:50.822
Sure, go ahead.

31:50.912 --> 31:52.107
Be right back.

32:04.832 --> 32:08.109
It's a small world
after all

32:08.192 --> 32:11.549
It's a small world
after all

32:11.632 --> 32:13.908
It's a small, small world

32:13.992 --> 32:15.187
Everybody

32:15.272 --> 32:17.662
It's a small world
after all

32:27.752 --> 32:30.631
OK, I got the jumbo
so we could share.

32:31.924 --> 32:33.597
Were you just
picking your nose?

32:33.684 --> 32:36.153
No, I had an itch
on the inside.

33:04.808 --> 33:06.527
Timon, you OK?

33:06.608 --> 33:08.725
I give up.

33:08.808 --> 33:10.367
But you can't give up.

33:10.448 --> 33:12.360
We still haven't found
our dream home.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.565
Forget it, Pumbaa.

33:14.648 --> 33:17.368
I've been dragging you
down long enough.

33:17.448 --> 33:21.044
I'm going home,
and I suggest you do the same.

33:21.128 --> 33:25.441
I would if I could,
but I can't.

33:25.528 --> 33:28.248
Sure you can, buddy.
I won't stop you.

33:28.328 --> 33:30.968
No, I mean...
I don't have a home.

33:31.048 --> 33:33.279
You don't? What happened?
Are you lost?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.481
No place
good enough for you?

33:38.168 --> 33:40.524
What, you're all alone
in this big empty world?

33:52.808 --> 33:54.242
The truth is...

33:55.888 --> 33:57.481
I'm all alone, too.

34:01.888 --> 34:05.040
Pumbaa, you're the only
friend I've ever had.

34:05.128 --> 34:07.040
You mean...

34:07.128 --> 34:08.357
Yeah, Pumbaa...

34:08.447 --> 34:10.599
and friends
stick together to the end.

34:23.527 --> 34:26.679
Timon, are you crying?

34:26.967 --> 34:28.960
I'm fine.

34:30.487 --> 34:32.525
I just have
something in my eye.

34:32.608 --> 34:34.440
Here, blow.

34:37.768 --> 34:39.646
Here, Pumbaa.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.447
Gee, thanks.

34:41.527 --> 34:43.804
OK, I'm better.

35:09.848 --> 35:11.441
Aw, well. It's too bad...

35:11.528 --> 35:13.326
we never found
that perfect place.

35:13.408 --> 35:15.365
Why'd we ever listen
to that stupid monkey?

35:15.448 --> 35:19.522
I think maybe you're
giving up too soon, Timon.

35:19.608 --> 35:21.725
Beyond what you see.

35:23.408 --> 35:26.845
Remember that place
I told you about?

35:26.928 --> 35:28.567
Forget about
your place.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.446
Get a load
of what I found.

35:30.528 --> 35:34.124
Talk about
beyond what you see.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.962
Pumbaa, this is
our dream home.

35:37.048 --> 35:38.368
Dramatic views.

35:39.968 --> 35:41.925
Your very own
porch swing.

35:42.008 --> 35:44.079
Hot tub and spa.

35:44.168 --> 35:45.522
Well stocked cupboard.

35:46.888 --> 35:48.959
Let's celebrate!

35:51.091 --> 35:54.084
We found it--
the perfect life.

35:54.171 --> 35:57.289
I'll just whip up
a little something.

35:57.371 --> 35:59.647
He had the perfect name
for it, too.

35:59.731 --> 36:01.529
Come and get it.

36:01.611 --> 36:04.171
Such a wonderful phrase.
It had this rhythm.

36:04.251 --> 36:05.890
Laduda ladada.

36:05.971 --> 36:08.281
Try this--
hot tuna frittata.

36:08.371 --> 36:09.407
Hmm. No, that's not it.

36:09.491 --> 36:10.720
The spinach armada.

36:10.811 --> 36:12.450
Quiet, Pumbaa.
I'm trying to think.

36:12.531 --> 36:13.567
A spoon of ricotta.

36:13.651 --> 36:15.927
- Two words.
- A wormy piccata.

36:16.011 --> 36:18.401
- Six syllables.
- Kahuna colada.

36:18.491 --> 36:20.495
- Twelve letters.
- A blue enchilada.

36:20.496 --> 36:21.407
Rhymes with--

36:21.496 --> 36:23.169
- Legumes on a platter.
- Think.

36:23.256 --> 36:24.216
This ought to be hotter.

36:24.256 --> 36:27.010
- I forget.
- I got to lambada!

36:27.096 --> 36:29.930
Hey, how can you dance
at a time like this?

36:30.016 --> 36:31.848
I'm dying here.

36:31.936 --> 36:34.132
Sorry about that, pal.

36:34.216 --> 36:35.650
Hakuna matata.

36:35.736 --> 36:37.932
Wahh-ahh-ahh...
come again?

36:38.016 --> 36:40.850
Hakuna matata--
it means "No worries."

36:48.176 --> 36:50.168
Hey, Timon, I got an idea.

36:50.256 --> 36:51.610
Let's do a sing-along.

36:51.696 --> 36:53.494
Oh, you tease.

36:53.576 --> 36:56.569
I love karaoke. I'm there.

36:56.656 --> 36:59.091
Hakuna Matata

36:59.176 --> 37:01.975
What a wonderfui phrase

37:02.056 --> 37:04.048
Hakuna Matata

37:04.136 --> 37:07.413
Ain't no passin' craze

37:07.496 --> 37:09.647
it means no worries

37:09.736 --> 37:11.807
For the rest of your days

37:11.896 --> 37:14.491
Wait a second.

37:14.576 --> 37:16.613
Pumbaa, where's the grub?

37:20.136 --> 37:23.174
You just can't
help yourself, can you?

37:23.256 --> 37:24.485
Sorry.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.286
OK, but this time,
show a little self-control.

37:28.376 --> 37:31.767
Hakuna Matata

37:40.016 --> 37:42.212
it means no worries

37:42.296 --> 37:45.573
For the rest of your days

37:45.656 --> 37:48.728
it's our probiem free

37:48.816 --> 37:50.853
Phiiosophy

37:50.936 --> 37:52.370
Hakuna Matata

37:52.456 --> 37:54.209
Matata Hakuna Matata

38:01.496 --> 38:03.374
Hahuna ma-what-a?

38:04.856 --> 38:06.449
It means "No worries."

38:06.536 --> 38:07.856
I see.

38:07.936 --> 38:09.575
So, I told the boy...

38:09.656 --> 38:11.807
to find hakuna matata...

38:11.896 --> 38:14.536
you must look
beyond what you see.

38:14.616 --> 38:17.006
A metaphor.

38:17.096 --> 38:19.656
Well, actually,
it's not a meta--

38:19.736 --> 38:22.296
You used a metaphor
on Timon?

38:22.376 --> 38:24.652
He takes things literally.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.568
That's it.
He's starving out there.

38:26.656 --> 38:27.976
I just know it.

38:28.056 --> 38:31.015
Max, Timon's out there
chasing metaphors.

38:31.096 --> 38:32.496
I've got to go find him.

38:32.576 --> 38:33.851
Are you nuts?

38:33.936 --> 38:36.371
Nice to have a supportive
family, isn't it?

38:36.456 --> 38:38.129
Well, here I go.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.776
Remember, the journey
of a thousand miles...

38:40.856 --> 38:42.688
begins with
the first step.

38:42.776 --> 38:45.848
Thanks.
Here's my first step.

38:50.176 --> 38:54.489
This bowling for porcupines
wasn't the best idea, huh?

38:54.576 --> 38:56.135
Yeah. Got to be
right up there...

38:56.216 --> 38:57.889
with bobbing
for snapping turtles.

38:59.096 --> 39:01.656
That's going to leave a mark.

39:01.736 --> 39:04.535
Hey, look, Timon,
buzzards.

39:04.616 --> 39:06.050
What do you say,
one more round?

39:06.136 --> 39:07.695
Oh, sure. There must be
some part of me...

39:07.776 --> 39:09.256
we haven't injured yet.

39:09.336 --> 39:12.170
Oh, please, oh, please?

39:12.256 --> 39:13.531
Nah, Pumbaa, I'm beat.

39:13.616 --> 39:15.414
You go ahead.
I'm calling it a day.

39:15.496 --> 39:19.854
But it's no fun alone.

39:24.936 --> 39:26.370
Why not?

39:26.456 --> 39:29.210
One more run
won't change our lives.

39:31.416 --> 39:33.214
Who knows
why fate led us...

39:33.296 --> 39:34.855
to little Simba that day.

39:37.420 --> 39:38.854
or my innate courage...

39:38.940 --> 39:41.375
my valiant
and fearless way of--

39:41.460 --> 39:44.055
OK, who's in charge
of the freeze frames?

39:44.140 --> 39:45.210
Sorry.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.019
Anywho...

39:47.100 --> 39:49.217
rescuing Simba
was a cinch.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.974
Then came the really
scary part--

39:54.420 --> 39:55.410
parenthood.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.056
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle

39:59.140 --> 40:02.611
The lion sleeps tonight

40:02.700 --> 40:06.063
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle...

40:06.064 --> 40:08.340
Timon. Timon.

40:08.424 --> 40:09.414
Timon!

40:10.984 --> 40:12.543
- I got to go.
- Go?

40:12.624 --> 40:13.694
Go where?

40:13.784 --> 40:16.060
You know, go--bad.

40:16.144 --> 40:17.624
Oh, go.
Why didn't you say so?

40:17.704 --> 40:18.694
Come on, let's go.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.174
When you got to go
you got to go.

40:21.264 --> 40:23.654
Young lion,
get down from there.

40:23.744 --> 40:26.259
Alright!

40:26.344 --> 40:28.336
Man, you guys look like
ants down there.

40:28.424 --> 40:30.336
I'm counting to three.

40:35.384 --> 40:37.216
One, two...

40:38.744 --> 40:40.576
three.

40:40.664 --> 40:42.178
In the jungle,
the mighty jungle

40:42.264 --> 40:43.254
Timon.

40:43.344 --> 40:44.744
Again?

40:44.824 --> 40:46.543
No. I'm thirsty.

40:46.624 --> 40:47.978
You know this means
you'll be up again...

40:48.064 --> 40:50.021
about two hours from now.

40:50.104 --> 40:51.902
Jungle boogie

40:51.984 --> 40:54.215
Jungle boogie, get it on

40:54.304 --> 40:56.182
Hang on, Simba!
I'll save you!

41:02.264 --> 41:04.824
Timon?

41:04.904 --> 41:07.703
We're going to get old
walking across this thing.

41:07.784 --> 41:10.583
- Jungle boogie
- Whoa!

41:10.664 --> 41:12.098
In the jungle,
the might--

41:12.184 --> 41:13.823
Timon?

41:13.904 --> 41:15.657
What have you got
against the concept...

41:15.744 --> 41:18.020
of a good night's
sleep, huh?

41:18.104 --> 41:20.744
Actually, I...

41:20.824 --> 41:22.099
I had a bad dream.

41:22.184 --> 41:25.621
Oh, well...

41:25.704 --> 41:27.616
It wasn't me.

41:27.704 --> 41:30.139
Junior had a bad dream.

41:32.504 --> 41:35.019
Why don't you sleep
over here with us?

41:35.104 --> 41:37.380
Mi Pumbaa, su Pumbaa.

41:37.464 --> 41:38.693
Alright!

41:38.784 --> 41:41.777
The lion sleeps tonight

41:41.864 --> 41:43.821
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

41:43.904 --> 41:45.896
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.580
My little darling

42:24.668 --> 42:27.308
Don't fear, my little darling

42:27.388 --> 42:30.540
Hey-a,
oh, my little darling

42:30.628 --> 42:38.628
Oh, don't fear,
my little darling

42:41.792 --> 42:44.352
Don't fear, my little darling

42:44.432 --> 42:47.903
Hey-a, oh, my little darling

43:01.672 --> 43:03.903
Whoa. Watch where you aim
that morning breath.

43:03.992 --> 43:05.631
That should come
with a warning label.

43:05.712 --> 43:07.590
What a wake-up call.

43:07.672 --> 43:09.823
Looks like
someone woke up...

43:09.912 --> 43:11.585
on the wrong side
of the warthog.

43:11.672 --> 43:12.788
What's the matter, pops?

43:12.872 --> 43:14.670
Had a little too much
hakuna matata?

43:14.752 --> 43:18.632
Sonny boy,
I invented hakuna matata.

43:18.712 --> 43:21.181
Oh, yeah?
Well, I perfected it.

43:21.272 --> 43:23.264
Sure you did,
sure you did.

43:23.352 --> 43:25.469
Pumbaa, who holds
the record...

43:25.552 --> 43:27.828
for the world's
longest bug belch?

43:27.912 --> 43:29.585
That would be Simba.

43:29.672 --> 43:31.072
Alrighty, then.

43:31.152 --> 43:33.383
Who's the champion
at slug swallowing?

43:33.472 --> 43:34.383
Simba again.

43:34.472 --> 43:36.065
- Cricket crunching?
- Simba.

43:36.152 --> 43:37.108
- Grub gulping?
- Simba.

43:37.192 --> 43:38.472
- Maggot munching?
- Still Simba.

43:38.552 --> 43:39.588
Snail slurping?

43:39.672 --> 43:41.231
Nobody.

43:41.312 --> 43:43.986
We never had a snail
eating contest before.

43:57.192 --> 44:01.391
I don't think this is
such a good idea.

44:48.152 --> 44:51.350
I told you this wasn't
such a good idea.

45:11.556 --> 45:14.947
Thus did the pupil
surpass the teacher.

45:15.036 --> 45:16.265
You've been
hanging around...

45:16.356 --> 45:17.756
with the monkey again,
haven't you?

45:26.316 --> 45:29.468
Our Simba is growing up.

45:32.601 --> 45:38.552
Is this the little boy
I carried?

45:38.641 --> 45:43.591
When did he grow
to be so tall?

45:43.681 --> 45:46.958
Wasn't it yesterday

45:47.041 --> 45:53.754
When he was small?

45:53.841 --> 45:56.401
Sunrise, sunset

45:56.481 --> 45:59.440
Sunrise, sunset

45:59.521 --> 46:05.051
Swiftly fly the years

46:05.052 --> 46:11.447
One season
following another

46:11.532 --> 46:14.650
Laden with happiness

46:14.732 --> 46:19.409
And tears

46:21.012 --> 46:23.846
So, you see, that's why
they call it a dung beetle.

46:23.932 --> 46:25.491
You don't say.

46:25.572 --> 46:27.006
And yet still so tasty.

46:27.092 --> 46:30.005
Yeah, and they're
my favourite, too.

46:39.656 --> 46:41.773
Just what
the doctor ordered.

46:41.856 --> 46:44.655
Yep. After a long day
of doing nothing...

46:44.736 --> 46:46.853
it's good to kick back.

46:46.936 --> 46:49.132
Three pals and no worries.

46:49.216 --> 46:51.811
What more could you want?

47:01.416 --> 47:04.136
I'm bushed.

47:04.216 --> 47:07.493
Think I'll turn in
for the night.

47:14.936 --> 47:15.926
I'm out.

47:16.016 --> 47:17.609
Right behind you.

47:20.696 --> 47:22.289
You're killing me.

47:25.416 --> 47:28.693
Timon, it's your turn
to say good night.

47:28.776 --> 47:29.812
Good night.

47:29.896 --> 47:31.330
Sleep tight.

47:31.416 --> 47:33.408
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

47:56.696 --> 47:59.131
You got to admit...

47:59.216 --> 48:01.412
we had a pretty
good thing going there.

48:01.496 --> 48:04.295
We could've gone on
like that forever.

48:04.376 --> 48:07.448
Except for one
teeny weeny little thing...

48:07.536 --> 48:09.095
we forgot to count on.

48:11.576 --> 48:14.216
Nala?

48:16.056 --> 48:17.456
- How did you--
- How did you--

48:17.536 --> 48:20.899
This is a disaster, Pumbaa--
a disaster, I tell you.

48:20.900 --> 48:23.051
You mean because they've
finally found each other...

48:23.140 --> 48:25.609
like two soul mates
joined across the years...

48:25.700 --> 48:27.373
by the bonds of true love?

48:27.460 --> 48:29.258
Sweet, innocent
little Pumbaa.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.297
She's going to put a stake
right through the heart...

48:31.380 --> 48:32.700
of our hakuna matata.

48:32.780 --> 48:36.091
Then I guess
we ought to do something.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.490
And I know just what it is.

48:38.580 --> 48:42.938
Pumbaa, we can't let them
feel the love tonight.

49:02.464 --> 49:08.654
Can you feel
the love tonight?

49:25.904 --> 49:31.582
Can you feel
the love tonight?

49:31.664 --> 49:33.815
That's so romantic.

49:43.664 --> 49:45.098
Can you feel
the love tonight?

50:09.184 --> 50:15.579
Can you feel
the love tonight?

50:15.664 --> 50:21.296
The peace
the evening brings?

50:24.624 --> 50:26.138
Well, that worked
like a dream.

50:26.224 --> 50:27.453
It did?

50:27.544 --> 50:30.537
Sarcasm is a foreign
language to you, isn't it?

50:30.624 --> 50:31.614
Look!

50:33.544 --> 50:35.376
Can you feel
the love tonight?

50:35.464 --> 50:37.660
She's making those eyes.

50:39.987 --> 50:41.546
They're laughing...

50:41.627 --> 50:43.664
and hugging...

50:43.747 --> 50:46.057
and...

50:47.507 --> 50:53.185
And if he falls
in love tonight

50:54.747 --> 51:00.220
It can be assumed

51:00.307 --> 51:02.697
His carefree days

51:02.787 --> 51:05.939
With us are history

51:06.027 --> 51:14.027
In short,
our pal is doomed

51:44.112 --> 51:45.546
That's it, buddy.

51:45.632 --> 51:48.750
We gave it our best shot,
but he's a goner.

51:50.512 --> 51:52.185
Maybe not.

51:52.272 --> 51:54.264
You never give up, do you?

51:54.352 --> 51:55.832
Look.

51:55.912 --> 51:57.744
You don't even know
what I've been through.

51:57.832 --> 51:59.027
I would
if you'd just tell me.

51:59.112 --> 52:01.308
- Forget it.
- Fine!

52:03.832 --> 52:06.347
Pumbaa, do you know
what this means?

52:06.432 --> 52:07.946
He can't express
his feelings...

52:08.032 --> 52:09.432
and she has
commitment issues?

52:09.512 --> 52:10.946
We won.

52:11.032 --> 52:13.069
We split them up.

52:13.152 --> 52:15.951
And that's a good thing?

52:19.312 --> 52:22.908
He seems to be
taking it kind of hard.

52:22.992 --> 52:24.984
Yeah, I know.
Look, I...

52:25.072 --> 52:26.711
But it's the best
thing for us.

52:26.792 --> 52:28.112
I mean for him.

52:28.192 --> 52:29.467
Let's go, Pumbaa.

52:29.552 --> 52:31.987
I think this storm's
coming to a head.

52:34.152 --> 52:37.384
Hakuna matata
is safe at last, pal...

52:37.472 --> 52:40.544
because nothing's gonna
take our boy away now.

52:40.712 --> 52:43.307
He's gone?
What do you mean, he's gone?

52:43.392 --> 52:45.349
It's just like
the baboon said.

52:45.432 --> 52:47.549
The king has returned.

52:53.032 --> 52:55.866
You want me
to go over it again?

52:55.952 --> 52:57.302
Yes, please, but be a dear...

52:57.392 --> 52:59.145
and just skip to
the part about Simba--

52:59.232 --> 53:01.952
not that your childhood
wasn't fascinating.

53:02.032 --> 53:04.263
OK, look, Simba's
the rightful king...

53:04.352 --> 53:05.672
but after
he disappeared...

53:05.752 --> 53:07.266
Scar proclaimed
himself the king...

53:07.352 --> 53:09.071
and formed an alliance
with the hyenas.

53:09.152 --> 53:10.222
Poor Simba--

53:10.312 --> 53:11.541
the treachery,
the villainy...

53:11.632 --> 53:14.670
the sheer
indescribable horror.

53:14.752 --> 53:16.072
Blah, blah, blah.

53:16.152 --> 53:17.745
Why is she toying with us?

53:17.832 --> 53:19.710
This crazy chick
is going to eat us.

53:19.792 --> 53:22.068
Simba has to go home
to challenge his uncle...

53:22.152 --> 53:24.542
and reclaim his
rightful place as king.

53:28.672 --> 53:31.062
Don't you get it?

53:31.152 --> 53:35.305
Simba needs us--now!

53:35.392 --> 53:36.792
He needs us?

53:36.872 --> 53:38.545
Then he shouldn't
have left us!

53:38.632 --> 53:41.192
If he wants to run off
to be "His Highness"...

53:41.272 --> 53:45.312
I say don't let the branches
hit you on the way out.

53:45.392 --> 53:48.590
Leave hakuna matata to someone
who appreciates it.

53:48.672 --> 53:52.712
But, Timon, it's not really
hakuna matata without Simba.

53:52.792 --> 53:54.909
What's gotten into you?
Not hakuna matata?

53:54.992 --> 53:57.587
That's crazy talk--
crazy talk, I tell you.

53:57.672 --> 53:59.026
Nothing's changed here.

53:59.112 --> 54:01.149
We had hakuna matata
before Simba...

54:01.232 --> 54:03.224
and we've still
got it now.

54:03.312 --> 54:05.383
We got to go help
our friend, Timon.

54:05.472 --> 54:07.350
Et tu, Pumbaa?

54:07.432 --> 54:10.425
You're just going to walk away,
give up on all this?

54:10.512 --> 54:12.592
What happened to "Friends
stick together to the end"?

54:14.112 --> 54:17.992
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

54:25.632 --> 54:28.784
I got everything
I ever wanted right here.

54:48.192 --> 54:50.787
Now, this is
more like it--

54:50.872 --> 54:53.467
elbow room.

55:07.032 --> 55:08.830
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

55:18.432 --> 55:21.152
Hakuna matata

55:21.232 --> 55:25.021
What a wonderful phrase

55:25.112 --> 55:28.184
Hakuna matata

55:29.672 --> 55:34.189
Ain't no passing craze

55:34.272 --> 55:36.070
It means...

55:37.632 --> 55:40.192
No worries.

55:43.072 --> 55:45.268
You. No, no.
Don't say a word.

55:45.352 --> 55:46.911
I know what
you're going to say.

55:46.992 --> 55:49.143
Did you find hakuna matata?

55:49.232 --> 55:51.224
Well, yes, I did.

55:51.312 --> 55:52.632
Thank you very much.

55:52.712 --> 55:54.431
And I am happy.

55:54.512 --> 55:57.391
Happy, happy,
deliriously happy.

55:57.472 --> 56:00.032
I see.

56:00.112 --> 56:01.546
Happy, is it?

56:01.632 --> 56:04.101
So, if you're so happy,
why do you look so miserable?

56:04.192 --> 56:05.387
Miserable, you say?

56:05.472 --> 56:06.622
Why should I be miserable?

56:06.712 --> 56:08.988
I don't know.
Maybe my two best pals...

56:09.072 --> 56:10.506
in the world deserted me.

56:10.592 --> 56:15.508
They've headed off
on some heroic mission.

56:15.592 --> 56:19.268
My friends are gone.

56:22.872 --> 56:27.185
And my hakuna matata
went with them.

56:28.552 --> 56:31.465
Would you mind?

56:33.032 --> 56:35.149
Thanks.
I'm glad we had this talk.

56:37.792 --> 56:40.705
My work here is done.

57:18.152 --> 57:20.667
Friends stick together
to the end.

57:30.992 --> 57:32.187
What was with the running?

57:32.272 --> 57:33.467
If you can call that running.

57:33.552 --> 57:35.589
I was giving you
time to catch up.

57:35.672 --> 57:40.110
You big lug.

57:41.112 --> 57:42.432
Hop on, buddy.

57:44.476 --> 57:47.116
Let's whip some grass.

57:47.196 --> 57:49.756
This is the stuff of legends--

57:49.836 --> 57:51.350
an epic struggle...

57:51.436 --> 57:54.076
the place
where heroes are born.

57:54.156 --> 57:58.230
Pumbaa, this could be
our finest hour.

57:58.316 --> 57:59.875
Luau!

57:59.956 --> 58:01.390
If you're hungry for a hunk
of fat and juicy meat

58:01.476 --> 58:02.916
Eat my buddy Pumbaa
here because he--

58:02.996 --> 58:05.465
Let's just cut
to the chase, shall we?

58:05.556 --> 58:06.910
Oh, sure.

58:15.040 --> 58:16.030
What the--

58:25.880 --> 58:28.952
I love the smell of Pumbaa
in the morning.

58:29.040 --> 58:32.511
Hey, move your tush, honey.

58:32.600 --> 58:34.000
Ma? Uncle Max?

58:34.080 --> 58:36.311
- Timmy!
- Timon?

58:36.400 --> 58:37.993
What are you doing here?

58:38.080 --> 58:39.196
Looking for you.

58:39.280 --> 58:42.796
Mommy's here.

58:42.880 --> 58:45.679
Well, let me introduce you
to my best friend.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.513
Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.000
Ma, Uncle Max, Pumbaa.

58:50.040 --> 58:51.759
Look, there's Simba...

58:51.840 --> 58:53.593
and that must be
his uncle Scar.

58:53.680 --> 58:55.478
Good, they're
talking things out...

58:55.560 --> 58:56.960
which is how it should be.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.440
You know,
I have a feeling...

58:58.520 --> 59:00.239
everything's going
to be just fine.

59:01.600 --> 59:03.319
On the other hand...

59:03.400 --> 59:05.756
The hyenas are up there
protecting Scar.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.274
What do we do?

59:07.360 --> 59:08.635
Well, I've got a plan.

59:08.720 --> 59:10.518
How can we help?

59:10.600 --> 59:12.717
Ma, Uncle Max, you're
going to dig a trap.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.439
We're going to need...

59:14.520 --> 59:16.000
dare I say it?

59:16.080 --> 59:19.278
Tunnels--lots and lots
of tunnels.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.840
And, Pumbaa,
you and me...

59:20.920 --> 59:22.639
we've got to get those
hyenas away from Simba.

59:22.720 --> 59:24.518
And lure them into the trap?

59:24.600 --> 59:27.513
Nothing gets past you.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.671
Come on, Pumbaa,
let's ride.

59:33.160 --> 59:36.073
Something's different
about Timon.

59:36.160 --> 59:39.471
You think?
He's wearing a dress!

59:49.040 --> 59:50.997
Hey, Pumbaa.

59:51.080 --> 59:53.595
What do you call a hyena
with half a brain?

59:53.680 --> 59:56.639
Beats me, Timon. What?

59:56.720 --> 59:57.710
Gifted.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.314
They're talking about us.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.679
For your last meal,
you're going to eat those words.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.993
Ma, I think we got
their attention.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:18.596
Not yet. Keep stalling.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.239
OK.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.920
You got to be kidding me.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:28.034
Now, Ma?

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.634
Need more time, honey.

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:36.352
Freestyle.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.278
Encore, encore.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.670
No, no, no.
You mean entree, entree.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.319
No, you right.
Let's just eat them.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.357
Is it ready yet, Ma?

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.511
Not yet. Keep stalling.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.750
Wait, wait.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.956
Hold on a second.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.600
Timon? What are you doing?

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.038
Shenzi Marie Predatora
Veldetta Jacquelina Hyena...

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.672
would you do me the honour
of becoming my bride?

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.160
I don't think so.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.914
Shenzi Marie, please.
I know what you're thinking.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.753
We're too different.
It'll never work.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.718
What will the children
look like?

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.952
That violates
so many laws of nature.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.714
Listen to me. The problems
of a couple of wacky kids...

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.712
like us don't amount
to a hill of termites...

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.473
in this nutty
circle of life thing.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.914
And so I ask you--

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.276
if not now, when?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.034
If not me, who?

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.873
I'm lonely.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.872
Can I be your best man?

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.553
I say we skip the wedding...

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:45.950
and go straight
to the buffet.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:46.996
Now?

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.117
Sure, if you're ready.

01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.520
Now, Max, now!

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.991
Hyenas in the hole!

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.315
I need help. It didn't work.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.720
Hey, it works for me.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.834
What are we going to do?

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.475
What?

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.550
Timon, no!

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:30.036
Let's get 'em.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.318
I'd say Scar is down and out.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.959
We did it! We did it!

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.157
Where's Timon?
Where's my baby?

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.154
He's hurt! Oh, no!
He's dead! Or worse!

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.277
We got to find him.
We've got to find him.

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:06.316
It's OK, Ma.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.710
Please. It is not OK!

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.395
Don't you tell me it's OK!

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:15.480
Timmy!

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.600
My son...

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:21.751
the hero.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.519
You missed a spot.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.677
That's so beautiful.

01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.558
Choking. Not breathing.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.879
I couldn't have done it
without you guys.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:18.439
That's our boy.

01:04:18.523 --> 01:04:22.278
I promised myself
I wasn't going to cry.

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:48.566
You've really come
a long way, Timon.

01:04:48.648 --> 01:04:51.527
Did you find what
you were looking for?

01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:55.727
I found a place that was
beyond my wildest dreams...

01:04:55.808 --> 01:04:57.925
but it still wasn't home.

01:04:58.008 --> 01:05:00.364
Let's go home, Ma.

01:05:07.368 --> 01:05:11.885
Welcome to our new home--
a predator-free environment.

01:05:11.968 --> 01:05:13.880
I got to hand it
to you, Timon.

01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:16.278
This place has everything.

01:05:16.368 --> 01:05:18.928
Well, now that
we're all here, it does.

01:05:30.088 --> 01:05:31.602
Crane...

01:05:31.688 --> 01:05:33.327
spreads its wings...

01:05:33.408 --> 01:05:37.004
turns with dainty hands.

01:05:37.088 --> 01:05:39.205
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:05:39.288 --> 01:05:41.439
We're never gonna dig
another tunnah

01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:43.599
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:05:43.688 --> 01:05:45.919
Nevermore the hyena come

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:48.239
Sing the praises of brave Timon

01:05:48.328 --> 01:05:50.479
The bravest meerkat
we've ever known

01:05:50.568 --> 01:05:52.844
Never dreamed
he'd help Simba shine

01:05:52.928 --> 01:05:55.284
Proved it's cool
to hang out with swine

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:57.599
Accidentally saved the day

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.645
Planned it so
it would look that way

01:05:59.728 --> 01:06:01.879
Brought us out
of the dirt and sand

01:06:01.968 --> 01:06:05.086
Led his family
to the promised land

01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:06.648
Sing the praises of brave Timon

01:06:06.728 --> 01:06:14.728
Bravest meerkat
we've ever known

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:18.922
Well, that's it--

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.443
the big wrap-up,
the happy ending...

01:06:21.528 --> 01:06:23.679
the grand finale.

01:06:23.768 --> 01:06:25.725
It's over already?

01:06:25.808 --> 01:06:27.568
Well, Pumbaa, that's
the thing about endings.

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:29.367
They come at the end.

01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:31.201
Can we watch it again?

01:06:32.972 --> 01:06:33.883
Maybe tomorrow.

01:06:33.972 --> 01:06:35.452
Hey, what are
you guys doing?

01:06:35.532 --> 01:06:39.208
You didn't tell me
you were watching the movie.

01:06:39.292 --> 01:06:40.692
I want to watch, too.

01:06:40.772 --> 01:06:43.287
Ma, we just finished.
Show's over.

01:06:43.372 --> 01:06:45.012
Well, you're just gonna
have to rewind it.

01:06:45.092 --> 01:06:46.242
Ma!

01:06:46.332 --> 01:06:48.164
Uncle Max,
we're gonna watch the movie.

01:06:48.252 --> 01:06:50.448
Oh, no!

01:06:50.532 --> 01:06:52.091
Hey, I brought extra butter.

01:06:52.172 --> 01:06:54.892
Hey, you guys
are watching the movie?

01:06:54.972 --> 01:06:57.646
Any story worth telling
is worth telling twice.

01:06:59.332 --> 01:07:00.243
What the--

01:07:00.332 --> 01:07:01.855
Oh, excuse me.

01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:02.926
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

01:07:03.016 --> 01:07:03.976
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

01:07:04.056 --> 01:07:05.126
- Excuse me.
- Get out of the way.

01:07:05.216 --> 01:07:06.286
Who is this crowd?

01:07:06.376 --> 01:07:09.687
Hey, down in front!

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:11.051
Gawrsh!

01:07:11.136 --> 01:07:12.286
Aloha!

01:07:17.256 --> 01:07:18.485
Watch it!

01:07:23.496 --> 01:07:26.250
OK, buddy, you win.

01:07:26.336 --> 01:07:27.565
Sure you don't mind?

01:07:27.656 --> 01:07:29.136
Hakuna matata.

01:07:29.216 --> 01:07:30.332
Sorry.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:31.896
Timon...

01:07:31.976 --> 01:07:34.935
I still don't do
so well in crowds.

01:07:35.096 --> 01:07:40.216
Quick before
the hyena come

01:07:44.536 --> 01:07:45.970
All we do is dig...

01:07:46.056 --> 01:07:47.854
so we can hide and hide
so we can dig.

01:07:47.936 --> 01:07:49.256
Dig

01:07:52.656 --> 01:07:53.931
All we do is dig...

01:07:54.016 --> 01:07:55.655
so we can hide and hide
so we can dig.

01:07:55.736 --> 01:07:56.886
Dig

01:07:56.976 --> 01:07:58.456
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:07:58.536 --> 01:08:00.255
Keep a-digging,
never get done

01:08:00.336 --> 01:08:02.407
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:08:02.496 --> 01:08:04.453
Quick,
before the hyena come

01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:06.573
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:08:06.656 --> 01:08:08.648
Keep a-digging,
never get done

01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:10.375
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:08:10.456 --> 01:08:12.687
Quick,
before the hyena come

01:08:15.456 --> 01:08:16.776
Hakuna matata.

01:08:16.856 --> 01:08:18.051
All we do is dig...

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.889
so we can hide and hide
so we can dig.

01:08:19.975 --> 01:08:21.205
Dig

01:08:22.975 --> 01:08:24.968
Hakuna matata.

01:08:25.055 --> 01:08:28.447
Quick, before the hyena,
hyena, hyena come

01:08:28.536 --> 01:08:30.528
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:08:30.616 --> 01:08:32.368
Keep a-digging,
never get done

01:08:32.456 --> 01:08:34.287
Digga tunnah,
dig, digga tunnah

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.493
Quick,
before the hyena come

01:08:44.176 --> 01:08:46.691
Quick,
before the hyena come

01:08:49.616 --> 01:08:50.810
Can you dig it?

01:08:50.895 --> 01:08:52.694
I can dig it

01:08:58.616 --> 01:09:02.166
Oh, yeah

01:09:02.256 --> 01:09:04.372
Oh whoa whoa whoa

01:09:04.456 --> 01:09:08.336
Sure is mellow
grazing in the grass

01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:09.656
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:09.736 --> 01:09:11.375
Baby, can you dig it?

01:09:11.456 --> 01:09:16.247
What a trip just watching
as the world goes past

01:09:16.336 --> 01:09:17.576
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:18.970
Baby, can you dig it?

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.013
There are so many
groovy things to see

01:09:21.095 --> 01:09:22.814
While grazing
in the grass

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:24.728
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:24.816 --> 01:09:26.011
Baby, can you dig it?

01:09:26.095 --> 01:09:27.654
Flowers with colors

01:09:27.736 --> 01:09:30.456
Making everything
out of sight in the grass

01:09:30.536 --> 01:09:31.890
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:31.975 --> 01:09:33.649
Here we go

01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:37.332
The sun beaming down
between the leaves

01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:39.169
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:39.256 --> 01:09:40.576
Baby, can you dig it?

01:09:40.656 --> 01:09:42.136
And the birds

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.651
Darting
in and out of the trees

01:09:44.736 --> 01:09:46.408
Grazing in the grass,
it's a gas

01:09:46.496 --> 01:09:48.010
Yeah, yeah

01:09:48.095 --> 01:09:50.247
And everything here
is so clear

01:09:50.336 --> 01:09:52.009
You can see it

01:09:52.095 --> 01:09:54.133
And everything here
is so near

01:09:54.216 --> 01:09:55.809
You can feel it

01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:58.013
And it's real

01:09:58.096 --> 01:09:59.849
So real, so real

01:09:59.936 --> 01:10:02.656
So real, so real, so real

01:10:02.736 --> 01:10:04.568
Can you dig it?

01:10:06.576 --> 01:10:08.169
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:10:08.256 --> 01:10:09.770
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:10:09.856 --> 01:10:11.654
Oh, let's dig it

01:10:11.736 --> 01:10:13.614
Can you dig it, baby?

01:10:13.696 --> 01:10:15.449
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:10:15.536 --> 01:10:17.129
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:10:17.216 --> 01:10:18.935
Oh, let's dig it

01:10:19.016 --> 01:10:23.215
Can you dig it, baby?

01:10:23.296 --> 01:10:26.175
We, let's dig it

01:10:28.616 --> 01:10:30.892
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:10:30.976 --> 01:10:33.445
We can dig it, baby,
everybody, let's dig it

01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:36.131
Can you dig it, baby?

01:10:36.216 --> 01:10:42.565
The sun beaming down
between the leaves

01:10:42.656 --> 01:10:44.932
And the birds

01:10:45.016 --> 01:10:48.726
Darting in and out
of the trees

01:10:51.176 --> 01:10:53.008
Everything here
is so clear

01:10:53.096 --> 01:10:54.496
You can see it

01:10:54.576 --> 01:10:56.408
And everything here
is so near

01:10:56.496 --> 01:10:58.374
You can feel it

01:10:58.456 --> 01:11:00.175
And it's real

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:02.134
So real, so real

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.856
So real, so real,
so real

01:11:04.936 --> 01:11:07.212
Can you dig it?

01:11:07.296 --> 01:11:08.935
Oh, yeah

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:10.696
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:11:10.736 --> 01:11:12.409
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:11:12.496 --> 01:11:14.249
Oh, let's dig it

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:15.895
Can you dig it, baby?

01:11:15.976 --> 01:11:17.888
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:11:17.976 --> 01:11:19.569
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:11:19.656 --> 01:11:21.375
Oh, let's dig it

01:11:21.456 --> 01:11:23.891
Can you dig it, baby?

01:11:23.976 --> 01:11:25.490
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:11:25.576 --> 01:11:27.135
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.536
Oh, let's dig it

01:11:28.616 --> 01:11:30.972
Baby

01:11:31.056 --> 01:11:32.736
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:11:32.816 --> 01:11:34.330
We can dig it, they can
dig it, you can dig it

01:11:34.416 --> 01:11:35.645
Oh, let's dig it

01:11:35.736 --> 01:11:37.329
Everything here
is so clear

01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:38.850
You can feel it

01:11:38.936 --> 01:11:40.689
I can dig it, he can dig it,
she can dig it

01:11:40.776 --> 01:11:42.813
We can dig it, baby,
everybody dig it

01:11:44.136 --> 01:11:50.087
It's Timon-a-rama time!

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:53.769
I've never been the type

01:11:53.856 --> 01:11:55.449
You'll have a perfect home

01:11:55.536 --> 01:11:57.050
To fall for all that hype

01:11:57.136 --> 01:11:58.570
Where no hyenas roam

01:11:58.656 --> 01:12:00.170
About the meerkat role

01:12:00.256 --> 01:12:01.895
Where it's a shoe-in cinch

01:12:01.976 --> 01:12:03.490
In some organic whole

01:12:03.576 --> 01:12:05.090
That you won't have to flinch

01:12:05.176 --> 01:12:06.769
And all that circle rot

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:08.290
And stand on guard as if

01:12:08.376 --> 01:12:10.208
Is just a cunning plot

01:12:10.296 --> 01:12:11.696
You've mastered
scratch and sniff

01:12:11.776 --> 01:12:13.290
For coming to the crunch

01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:14.651
A fantasy sublime

01:12:14.736 --> 01:12:16.409
I ain't nobody's lunch

01:12:16.496 --> 01:12:18.249
Timon-o-rama time

01:12:18.336 --> 01:12:22.046
This isn't for the birds,
it isn't monkeyshine

01:12:22.136 --> 01:12:23.934
I ain't asking for a lot

01:12:24.016 --> 01:12:26.212
But what is mine is mine

01:12:26.296 --> 01:12:29.653
You never want to argue
with a chorus line

01:12:29.736 --> 01:12:31.375
That's all I need

01:12:31.456 --> 01:12:32.970
That is all he needs

01:12:33.056 --> 01:12:34.809
Oh, I beg and plead

01:12:34.896 --> 01:12:36.615
Whoa, I beg and plead

01:12:36.696 --> 01:12:40.292
That is all

01:12:40.376 --> 01:12:43.289
I

01:12:43.376 --> 01:12:44.651
Need

01:12:45.305 --> 01:12:51.291
