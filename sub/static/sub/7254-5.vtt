WEBVTT

00:00.241 --> 00:02.122
Previously on
"Gilmore girls"...

00:02.132 --> 00:03.390
I'm not going anywhere.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.864
This is it for me.
You're it for me.

00:05.874 --> 00:07.723
I don't want to see
you get hurt again.

00:07.733 --> 00:08.962
I am being careful.

00:08.972 --> 00:10.104
You are leaving for London.

00:10.114 --> 00:11.677
Who knows when we'll
see each other again.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.244
What is the fun date?

00:13.254 --> 00:14.512
No hints.

00:14.528 --> 00:16.100
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

00:16.242 --> 00:18.271
What? No!

00:18.287 --> 00:20.873
We have to pick up
my mother from jail.

00:20.889 --> 00:22.832
Your mother's in jail?

00:22.849 --> 00:25.362
Oh, this night keeps
getting better and better.

00:25.376 --> 00:27.902
I can't wait to come see you, Logan.
I can't wait.

00:27.918 --> 00:29.660
Tell your mom you're not
gonna be home for Christmas.

00:29.695 --> 00:30.613
Christmas?

00:30.627 --> 00:33.540
You finally got menace to society
Emily Gilmore off the street.

00:33.557 --> 00:35.263
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

00:35.276 --> 00:37.351
Come on. Put that thing away.

00:37.388 --> 00:39.171
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:40.046 --> 00:41.741
Want to come in?

00:42.106 --> 00:43.863
Yeah?

00:47.408 --> 00:52.252
Okay. Toothbrush, hairbrush,
hypoallergenic pillow,

00:52.266 --> 00:54.932
chenille blanket --
ooh, comfort shoes.

00:54.947 --> 00:56.992
- Got them.
- Those are your comfort shoes?

00:57.008 --> 00:59.182
- Not mine -- Paul Anka's.
- We're staying in tonight.

00:59.198 --> 01:00.932
You can probably
get away with flats.

01:00.948 --> 01:02.671
He loves, loves,
loves chewing on these.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.242
They remind him of
a squirrel carcass.

01:04.254 --> 01:05.441
- Yummy.
- Don't judge.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.432
You eat jerky like it's
going out of style.

01:07.446 --> 01:09.852
So, all this stuff
is for Paul Anka?

01:09.867 --> 01:11.631
No, not all.
The toothbrush is mine.

01:11.645 --> 01:13.013
- Lorelai.
- What?

01:13.026 --> 01:14.931
It's his first night
staying at your house.

01:14.946 --> 01:17.651
I want him to have all the stuff
that makes him comfortable.

01:17.666 --> 01:18.761
Ooh -- tennis balls!

01:18.778 --> 01:20.433
I actually have tennis balls.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.251
- Penn or Wilson?
- You're joking.

01:22.266 --> 01:23.523
Paul Anka's must be Penn.

01:23.537 --> 01:25.273
They must be new,
they must be green --

01:25.285 --> 01:27.052
not orange and green,
just green.

01:27.066 --> 01:30.091
And FYI, you might want to watch
that sarcastic tone of yours

01:30.107 --> 01:32.011
because dogs are very
attuned to tone.

01:32.028 --> 01:34.901
It's kind of like chinese,
in that respect, dog language.

01:34.915 --> 01:36.141
It's very tone based.

01:36.158 --> 01:38.500
And you are stressing him
out right now with your tone.

01:38.518 --> 01:40.172
The dog is stressed?

01:40.187 --> 01:41.403
Look at him.

01:41.417 --> 01:42.843
And when he gets like this,

01:42.855 --> 01:46.093
you need to talk to him in
sweet and dulcet tones.

01:46.107 --> 01:50.073
Hi, Paul Anka.
Ooh, hi, boy! Hi!

01:50.088 --> 01:51.503
- Get it?
- Got it.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.280
Good. Sunglasses.

01:54.125 --> 01:56.790
This is not normal.
I want you to know that.

01:57.145 --> 01:58.550
The dog wears Ferragamos?

01:58.565 --> 02:00.613
Oh, please.
Don't give him any ideas.

02:00.628 --> 02:01.560
These are mine.

02:01.576 --> 02:03.540
All right, let's go.
You take this, this, and this.

02:03.578 --> 02:05.520
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

02:12.986 --> 02:15.592
Oops. Here, Paul Anka.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.987 --> 03:17.842
Hey.

03:17.855 --> 03:19.293
- Hey, you watching it?
- What?

03:19.308 --> 03:21.162
- The meteor shower.
- What meteor shower?

03:21.176 --> 03:24.320
It was on the news. The BBC said
there's some huge meteor shower tonight.

03:24.338 --> 03:25.450
I thought we could
watch it together.

03:25.488 --> 03:28.392
Uh, Logan, I have been in the
library for the past nine hours.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.882
I don't know anything
about any meteor showers.

03:29.916 --> 03:31.690
I could use a regular
shower, though.

03:31.706 --> 03:33.540
Go up on the roof
and check it out.

03:33.556 --> 03:35.110
- Now?
- Yes, now!

03:35.126 --> 03:36.912
It's supposed to start
in like two minutes.

03:36.927 --> 03:40.040
Ace! This is once-in-a-lifetime
celestial event. Get going.

03:40.057 --> 03:41.951
Okay, okay.
I'm getting. I'm going.

03:42.068 --> 03:43.212
Are you running?

03:43.228 --> 03:44.692
I'm running! I'm running!

03:44.707 --> 03:46.832
Who knew you were such
an astronomy buff?

03:46.847 --> 03:47.721
H urry!

03:47.735 --> 03:49.383
What has gotten into you?

03:50.086 --> 03:51.643
Nice night.

03:52.296 --> 03:53.882
Oh, my god!

03:53.896 --> 03:56.500
You're here!
What are you doing here?

03:57.158 --> 03:58.713
Happy to see me?

03:58.728 --> 04:00.941
Beyond happy! Ecstatic!

04:00.957 --> 04:02.621
I can't believe you're here!

04:02.637 --> 04:04.563
And look at me --
I'm covered in highlighter ink

04:04.576 --> 04:07.112
and I smell like
Fritos and Ginger ale.

04:07.127 --> 04:08.261
It's an aphrodisiac.

04:08.277 --> 04:10.150
You're here and
you did all this?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.290
You like?

04:11.306 --> 04:13.732
I love,
but you didn't have to do this.

04:13.745 --> 04:16.572
I mean, you're here. It's enough.
It's more than enough.

04:16.587 --> 04:18.870
Could you shut up now
so I can kiss you?

04:21.185 --> 04:23.722
- So there is no meteor shower?
- No meteor shower.

04:23.735 --> 04:25.772
So you used the entire
cosmos to trick me?

04:25.785 --> 04:27.241
I like to think big.

04:27.255 --> 04:30.493
So, what is going on?
Why are you here?

04:30.506 --> 04:32.620
I'm kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

04:34.418 --> 04:35.742
But why?

04:35.756 --> 04:38.862
The Fritos and Ginger ale thing.
I told you, huge turn-on.

04:40.858 --> 04:42.032
Explain yourself.

04:42.048 --> 04:43.472
I'm just here for a
quick business trip.

04:43.506 --> 04:44.661
- How quick?
- Too quick.

04:44.677 --> 04:45.903
How quick is "too quick"?

04:45.917 --> 04:48.411
I have 10:00 flight back
to London tomorrow night.

04:48.425 --> 04:49.903
Oh, that is too quick.

04:49.916 --> 04:51.992
That website my team has
been trying to buy --

04:52.005 --> 04:55.103
the owners finally agreed to sit down,
talk to us tomorrow over breakfast.

04:55.115 --> 04:56.991
Logan! That's great, right?

04:57.005 --> 04:58.973
I mean, three weeks ago,
they weren't even taking your calls.

04:59.005 --> 05:01.322
It is great.
However, not as exciting

05:01.337 --> 05:03.532
as kissing my
girlfriend on the roof.

05:05.835 --> 05:09.491
- Um, so, what's that amazing smell?
- Food from Ibiza.

05:09.508 --> 05:10.600
The island?

05:10.617 --> 05:12.511
The tapas place downtown.

05:12.526 --> 05:13.742
Ooh, did you get the duck?

05:13.758 --> 05:14.891
I did.

05:14.908 --> 05:17.632
- And the short ribs?
- Yes. And...

05:17.708 --> 05:20.742
Ooh! A 2003 red something.

05:20.757 --> 05:23.673
I bet it's very oaky and
corky and full of fruity legs.

05:23.687 --> 05:24.753
Know a lot about wine, do you?

05:24.785 --> 05:26.462
Not so much,
but the label's pretty.

05:26.476 --> 05:29.670
There's also gazpacho, that
cheese-pie thing you love, plus flan.

05:29.687 --> 05:31.642
Ooh, flan! You got me flan?

05:31.655 --> 05:33.263
Doesn't take much to make you happy,
does it?

05:33.298 --> 05:34.903
Not  when you're on
this continent.

05:37.586 --> 05:39.973
Okay, why don't you open this wine?
I want to taste those fruity legs,

05:40.008 --> 05:41.472
and I'll make you a
plate with extra flan.

05:41.505 --> 05:42.601
Okay.

05:43.508 --> 05:46.101
Ooh,  I'm so glad you're here!

05:51.795 --> 05:54.272
Stop! You're killing my Tivo.

05:54.286 --> 05:57.262
I'm not killing it. I'm composing on it.
I'm composing a symphony.

05:57.278 --> 05:59.090
- Finally, an instrument I can play.
- Give me that.

05:59.128 --> 06:00.543
- No, no, no!
- Give me!

06:00.556 --> 06:02.531
- Not until you explain your choices.
- What?

06:02.548 --> 06:05.910
"The View"? "Girlfriends"?
"SÃ¡bado Gigante"?

06:05.925 --> 06:08.473
Who controls this thing,
you or Pedro AlmodÃ³var?

06:08.485 --> 06:09.573
It's the nanny.

06:09.585 --> 06:11.212
Sure, it's a likely story.

06:11.228 --> 06:12.501
Give me, give me, give me.

06:12.516 --> 06:13.922
Did G.G. get to sleep okay?

06:13.936 --> 06:16.120
She did. I tried to skip to
the end of "Cinderella,"

06:16.133 --> 06:17.611
but she wouldn't let me.
It's my own fault.

06:17.647 --> 06:19.543
My wicked stepsister
voice kills.

06:19.559 --> 06:21.332
She's amazing, you know?

06:22.169 --> 06:23.953
That reminds me.

06:24.376 --> 06:28.631
Oh, no! You're not gonna show
me some of her art, are you?

06:28.648 --> 06:30.203
I never know what to
say in those situations.

06:30.238 --> 06:32.280
I mean, even when it was Rory's art,
you know?

06:32.297 --> 06:35.873
Three blue finger smudges
and some construction paper.

06:35.887 --> 06:37.863
It's not precocious.
It's just messy.

06:37.878 --> 06:39.962
Here. This came a
couple of days ago.

06:39.978 --> 06:41.683
It's from Sherry.

06:41.696 --> 06:42.881
From Sherry?

06:42.897 --> 06:45.603
Yeah, it's the first I've heard from
her since the divorce was final.

06:45.636 --> 06:47.030
Go ahead. Read it.

06:47.046 --> 06:49.121
Wow, how "dangerous
liaisons" of her.

06:49.138 --> 06:50.400
She doesn't call.
She doesn't e-mail.

06:50.438 --> 06:52.562
Then she sends you a
letter with a wax seal

06:52.578 --> 06:54.992
that weighs roughly the
same as a porterhouse.

06:55.005 --> 06:56.991
Well, she had a lot to say.

06:57.367 --> 07:00.002
Gosh. It's a lot of sorry.

07:00.018 --> 07:03.083
Yeah, 15 pages worth.
Believe me, I was not expecting this.

07:03.096 --> 07:05.712
Humility is not a side of
Sherry I've ever seen before.

07:05.728 --> 07:09.321
I don't know if it's the yoga
or the yoga instructor or --

07:09.335 --> 07:10.510
Yoga instructor?

07:10.528 --> 07:14.223
Yeah, she's dating her yoga instructor,
Jean-Claude or Jean-Pierre --

07:14.237 --> 07:15.533
one of those names that
always sounds fake.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.761
Anyway, it sounds like
she's really changed.

07:17.776 --> 07:20.100
She feels awful about what happened,
run away like that,

07:20.115 --> 07:22.510
and she wants to find a way to
be part of G.G.'s life again.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.383
- Honey, that's great.
- Right?

07:24.385 --> 07:25.843
Yeah.

07:25.866 --> 07:28.722
So, you got this two days ago
and you're showing it to me now.

07:28.735 --> 07:30.660
Well, I was gonna show it to
you a couple of days ago,

07:30.695 --> 07:32.583
but then I figured you
were coming over, so...

07:32.598 --> 07:34.291
- No, I'm not criticizing.
- You're not?

07:34.308 --> 07:36.060
No, I'm complimenting --
badly, obviously.

07:36.075 --> 07:38.680
But I'm complimenting.
You shared it with me.

07:38.696 --> 07:41.913
I kind of thought that was how the
whole adult-relationship thing worked.

07:41.926 --> 07:43.982
You know, openness, honesty.

07:43.995 --> 07:44.883
Interesting.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.641
And you're sure you don't want
to stash it away somewhere

07:47.655 --> 07:50.010
and then I find it -- accidentally,
of course -- months from now,

07:50.048 --> 07:52.740
and I get all weird and insecure about
why you didn't show it to me sooner?

07:52.775 --> 07:53.920
I'm good with the sharing.

07:53.938 --> 07:55.982
All right.
It's another way to go.

08:02.098 --> 08:06.843
That glass slipper
will fit my foot.

08:07.096 --> 08:09.000
That was my wicked
stepsister voice.

08:09.016 --> 08:10.512
Yeah, I figured.

08:17.615 --> 08:19.171
I'm so happy.

08:19.185 --> 08:20.811
Me too.

08:21.618 --> 08:23.771
You know you can't
do this in London?

08:23.785 --> 08:26.720
The city lights are so bright,
you almost never see the stars.

08:26.738 --> 08:28.803
Yeah, but it's London.

08:29.638 --> 08:31.930
Wait, are you tired of London?

08:31.947 --> 08:34.172
I'm tired of not
being around you.

08:34.187 --> 08:36.381
Yeah, but you can't
be tired of London.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.131
Samuel Johnson said,
"when you're tired of London,

08:38.166 --> 08:39.653
you're tired of life."

08:39.664 --> 08:42.620
Obviously, the man was never in
a long-distance relationship.

08:42.635 --> 08:46.062
That's true.
Boswell did keep quite close.

08:47.445 --> 08:48.900
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

08:48.918 --> 08:50.832
You're trying to sneak
a peek at my watch.

08:50.846 --> 08:53.662
Well, I just can't believe it.
I can't believe you're here.

08:53.677 --> 08:58.981
And I can't believe that you're leaving
in only 26 hours and 45 minutes.

08:58.998 --> 09:01.732
Come  on, think positive -- that's
an entire lifetime to a fruit fly.

09:01.747 --> 09:03.231
Actually, you're
thinking of a mayfly.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.463
Fruit flies can live for up to a month.
So what do you think?

09:05.496 --> 09:06.622
Can you stay for a month?

09:06.638 --> 09:08.963
I mean, what if your meeting
tomorrow goes really, really well?

09:08.996 --> 09:09.960
I hope it does.

09:09.976 --> 09:11.130
It will. It's a great idea.

09:11.147 --> 09:12.611
It's basically myspace.

09:12.627 --> 09:14.323
But by invitation only.

09:14.335 --> 09:16.913
And it'll be like an online
version of the Algonquin Group,

09:16.927 --> 09:18.052
like throwing a
party in your head

09:18.085 --> 09:20.433
where everyone you've ever
wanted to talk to is there --

09:20.446 --> 09:22.903
Ira Glass, Sofia Coppola,
Flaubert, Danger Mouse.

09:22.918 --> 09:24.813
The deal's not done yet.
Far from it.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.493
These guys aren't just gonna
hand over their website

09:26.527 --> 09:27.921
because we buy them breakfast.

09:27.938 --> 09:31.812
They might. Tell them that they
can order pancakes and eggs.

09:31.828 --> 09:33.112
Don't make them choose.

09:33.128 --> 09:36.353
Sausage, bacon, fruit, potatoes --
let them get the whole combo.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.810
'Cause then they will have to sell
it to you. It'd be rude not to.

09:38.848 --> 09:40.420
You are a business genius, Ace.

09:40.437 --> 09:42.150
Well, I'm taking econ
with my grandpa.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.171
Whatever happens,
we'll be ready.

09:44.188 --> 09:47.133
We've been working our asses off on
this one -- Nick, Bobby, Phillip.

09:47.146 --> 09:50.142
Oh, yes -- Phillip, Nick, Bobby.
The team. Starting lineup.

09:50.156 --> 09:53.280
It is a classic win-win.
They give us a foothold in new media.

09:53.297 --> 09:55.723
We give them a huge influx of capital,
which they need.

09:55.735 --> 09:58.172
Believe me, when it comes to debt
versus equity, they're screwed.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.751
They have no liquidity,
huge expenses, zero revenue.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.322
I mean, the targeted
advertising potential alone --

10:03.336 --> 10:04.912
What? What are you staring at?

10:04.928 --> 10:07.392
You, "Mr. Debt Versus Equity."

10:07.405 --> 10:10.122
- Are you mocking me?
- Yeah, but I like it.

10:10.135 --> 10:13.773
Tell me more about this um,
targeted advertising potential.

10:13.786 --> 10:15.552
What do you want to know?
There's pay-per-click,

10:15.586 --> 10:18.301
pay-per-lead, banner ads,
pixel tagging.

10:18.316 --> 10:20.960
Oh, stop.
I'm getting weak at the knees.

10:24.678 --> 10:25.790
Logan?

10:25.805 --> 10:28.471
Shh. Go back to sleep.
It's only 6:00.

10:28.485 --> 10:30.720
- In the morning?
- Yes, in the morning.

10:30.735 --> 10:32.940
Go back to sleep.
I'm sorry I woke you.

10:32.957 --> 10:34.611
Hey, where you going?
Come back here.

10:34.628 --> 10:36.493
I can't, I promised Nick, Bobby,
and Phillip I'd meet up with them

10:36.527 --> 10:39.000
- for breakfast before the pitch.
- I thought the pitch was at breakfast.

10:39.036 --> 10:41.461
It is, but we can't walk in there
unprepared. We got to go over our notes,

10:41.497 --> 10:43.691
talk strategy.
It's a pre-Breakfast breakfast.

10:43.705 --> 10:45.713
- Work dork.
- Did you just call me a work dork?

10:45.725 --> 10:47.661
Admit it.
Just admit that you're a work dork.

10:47.678 --> 10:50.621
I'll admit that I'm a work dork if you
admit that you love that I'm a work dork.

10:50.656 --> 10:51.772
Done.

10:52.517 --> 10:53.610
Now I really have to go.

10:53.626 --> 10:55.172
Hey, I have ways of making you stay,
you know.

10:55.207 --> 10:57.253
I know, I know,
but take pity on me, please.

10:57.268 --> 10:59.361
After work,
I promise I'm all yours. Dinner?

10:59.375 --> 11:01.112
Is it a pre-dinner
dinner or a real dinner?

11:01.128 --> 11:03.003
As many dinners as you want.

11:03.018 --> 11:05.592
Aw, man, I can't believe we've
wasted 4 1/2 hours on sleep.

11:05.605 --> 11:07.331
What are we down to now,
like 15 hours?

11:07.346 --> 11:09.673
Rory, I'm actually gonna need
both arms for this pitch.

11:09.688 --> 11:10.902
Okay, I'll let go.
Just one more kiss.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.822
- I don't believe you.
- Try me.

11:13.586 --> 11:16.231
- Hey! No fair!
- I'll call you later.

11:16.246 --> 11:18.672
- Work dork!
- Work dork lover.

11:25.346 --> 11:27.770
You need a tissue?
Oh, god, what is that?

11:27.787 --> 11:29.180
I don't know,
but it's horrible.

11:29.196 --> 11:31.731
Oh,  it is. It's foul.
It's like rotten cabbage.

11:31.745 --> 11:34.890
Or with dense but subtle
undertones of olives.

11:34.906 --> 11:37.710
There's nothing subtle about it.
It's like a sledgehammer to the nose.

11:37.725 --> 11:39.691
Oh, my god! What is that?

11:39.705 --> 11:40.912
It's not coming
from the kitchen?

11:40.946 --> 11:42.391
Bite your tongue.

11:42.407 --> 11:44.551
Wait, are we having
heart attacks right now?

11:44.566 --> 11:46.960
Isn't smelling something strange
the first sign of a heart attack?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.953
I don't think we're having a
communal massive heart attack.

11:48.985 --> 11:50.453
- Carcasses.
- What?

11:50.466 --> 11:52.020
Those strange,
angry-looking guests --

11:52.036 --> 11:54.273
I'm sure they are traveling
with decaying animal flesh.

11:54.288 --> 11:56.580
Yeah, 'cause that's the
most logical explanation.

11:56.596 --> 11:59.490
Gonna open a window,
see if we can air it out a little bit.

11:59.507 --> 12:02.182
- No, no, no!
- Close it! Close it! Close it!

12:02.697 --> 12:04.361
So glad we tried that.

12:04.377 --> 12:06.341
All right, I'm going out there
to see what's causing this.

12:06.378 --> 12:08.060
- Out there?!
- Are you crazy?!

12:08.078 --> 12:10.203
Maybe, but the sooner we can
find out what's causing this,

12:10.237 --> 12:12.750
the sooner we can run like
hell to less stinky ground.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.731
- I'm coming with you, then!
- Me too!

12:14.746 --> 12:15.840
Let's hang for a minute.

12:15.858 --> 12:18.152
If she makes it to the end of the block,
we'll join her.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.961
- Michel!
- What?

12:20.288 --> 12:21.642
Fine.

12:24.508 --> 12:26.702
Kirk, where's everybody going?

12:26.717 --> 12:28.610
Taylor called an
emergency town meeting.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.793
Not sure why.

12:29.806 --> 12:32.552
The smell, Kirk.
The horrible, horrible smell.

12:32.567 --> 12:33.441
Really?

12:33.457 --> 12:35.443
I just don't think
it's that bad.

12:35.456 --> 12:37.271
Well, come on, let's go.

12:37.285 --> 12:39.120
No. You know what?
On second thought,

12:39.135 --> 12:41.420
I'd rather smell this smell
for the rest of my life

12:41.436 --> 12:43.443
than see Luke at
a town meeting.

12:43.457 --> 12:45.000
- Oh, honey.
- It's okay.

12:45.016 --> 12:46.862
I'll go back to the Inn.
I'll be fine.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.450
Just call me when you
want me to pick you up.

12:52.306 --> 12:53.510
Finally!

12:53.527 --> 12:56.223
It's about time, Taylor!
We're dying here.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.953
I assure you, no one is dying.

12:58.966 --> 13:00.383
The substance causing this odor

13:00.398 --> 13:03.151
is not toxic in any way,
shape, or form.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.501
- It's pickles.
- That's no pickle!

13:05.516 --> 13:07.862
Pickle? Like one giant pickle?

13:07.875 --> 13:09.501
Order!

13:09.516 --> 13:12.831
As those of you who take an interest
in civic events may recall,

13:12.845 --> 13:15.483
three days ago a train
derailed just east of town --

13:15.496 --> 13:17.880
luckily, no one was
injured. However,

13:17.896 --> 13:22.012
3 1/2 tons of pickles and pickle
brine were scattered along the tracks.

13:22.027 --> 13:25.272
And due to some inevitable
delays in cleanup,

13:25.286 --> 13:29.452
those pickles have been baking
in the sun for three days.

13:30.385 --> 13:31.901
And you knew about this?

13:31.918 --> 13:33.232
It's a cover-up.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.160
We got picklegate!

13:35.296 --> 13:38.602
I did know about it, but it wasn't
a problem until this morning

13:38.615 --> 13:40.481
when the wind shifted.

13:40.498 --> 13:43.051
And instead of wafting easterly

13:43.067 --> 13:44.730
toward our neighbors
in Woodbridge,

13:44.745 --> 13:48.593
the smell seems to have
settled on Stars Hollow.

13:48.607 --> 13:51.721
Now, there's no telling
how long it will last.

13:51.876 --> 13:54.762
What?! People are
suffering here.

13:54.776 --> 13:57.812
How long does it take to pick
up a few measly pickles?

13:57.825 --> 14:02.592
Picking up the pickles is not
my main concern at the moment.

14:02.607 --> 14:06.231
Now, this is a matter
of pride, people.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.721
A huge principle is at stake.

14:08.738 --> 14:11.523
There's absolutely no reason
why we here in Stars Hollow

14:11.537 --> 14:14.102
should take responsibility
for this mess.

14:14.116 --> 14:17.593
The pickles themselves
hail from Ohio.

14:17.605 --> 14:20.282
The railroad company is incorporated
in the state of Delaware.

14:20.297 --> 14:24.001
And since all the pickles are on
the Woodbridge side of the tracks --

14:24.016 --> 14:27.080
Just pick up the damn
pickles, Taylor!

14:27.728 --> 14:30.180
Easier said than done.

14:30.197 --> 14:32.570
Even if we wanted to
do the wrong thing

14:32.586 --> 14:36.250
and assume fiscal
responsibility for this fiasco,

14:36.268 --> 14:38.973
the cost is astronomical.

14:38.988 --> 14:42.001
- $2,500 for --
- Sold!

14:42.018 --> 14:44.181
- Done!
- Pay, you big cheapskate!

14:44.195 --> 14:46.002
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:46.637 --> 14:48.950
All those in favor
of Stars Hollow

14:48.967 --> 14:52.932
taking a swift kick to the tush
and shouldering the entire cost --

14:52.946 --> 14:54.830
- Aye!
- Aye!

14:55.805 --> 14:57.253
Very well.

14:57.265 --> 14:58.811
Motion carried.

14:59.218 --> 15:02.020
Pickle smell gone
in 48 hours...

15:02.038 --> 15:05.210
along with everything
good about Stars Hollow.

15:09.436 --> 15:11.833
Breathe that in.
Isn't that fantastic?

15:11.847 --> 15:14.320
Forgot what fresh,
pickleless air smells like.

15:14.336 --> 15:16.542
Oh, so, you coming over to my
neck of the woods for lunch

15:16.576 --> 15:19.721
is really no reflection on how
desperately you needed to see me?

15:19.736 --> 15:24.220
Hmm...10% desperate need to see you,
90% pickles.

15:24.237 --> 15:26.851
You know, I'm actually looking
forward to friday night dinner.

15:26.866 --> 15:29.012
Because, as you well know,
the Gilmore house,

15:29.027 --> 15:31.981
like very expensive vodka,
is completely odorless.

15:31.996 --> 15:33.521
And you still want
me to come with?

15:33.535 --> 15:35.542
Yes, you, me, Rory,
numbers, babe.

15:35.558 --> 15:39.342
G.G., no. Skirt down! G.G.!

15:39.667 --> 15:42.010
You may want to look into
the whole skort concept.

15:42.027 --> 15:44.363
Hey, so,
I spoke with Sherry this morning.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.992
Oh, yeah.
What's the deal with her?

15:46.007 --> 15:49.213
Well, first she and G.G.
spoke for almost half an hour.

15:49.227 --> 15:51.200
That's as long as you can
do anything when you're 4.

15:51.237 --> 15:53.811
And then she and I talked.
I thanked her for the letter.

15:53.827 --> 15:55.291
She said everything
in it was true.

15:55.305 --> 15:57.933
She's totally serious
about this new life thing.

15:57.947 --> 15:59.210
No more workaholic ways.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.772
She's gardening and meditating,
all kinds of stuff.

16:01.785 --> 16:04.952
She's very self-actualized --
her words, not mine.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.171
Good for her.

16:06.186 --> 16:09.032
And the big news is,
she wants me to send G.G. to Paris

16:09.047 --> 16:10.843
to stay with her for
a couple of months.

16:10.856 --> 16:12.503
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.

16:12.518 --> 16:14.012
I mean,
I know it seems kind of sudden,

16:14.047 --> 16:16.561
but Sherry's taken this huge
leave of absence from work,

16:16.576 --> 16:19.120
and G.G. got so excited.
I mean, why not, right?

16:19.137 --> 16:20.913
She's not in school,
yet, just preschool,

16:20.928 --> 16:22.693
and she needs to get to
know her mother sometime.

16:22.727 --> 16:25.803
No, hey!
G.G., that's too high! Careful!

16:26.417 --> 16:30.532
So, what --
would you go to Paris with her?

16:30.546 --> 16:32.481
No,  I was thinking the
nanny could take her.

16:32.496 --> 16:33.562
She's dying to go.

16:33.578 --> 16:35.830
I mean, it's Paris, right?
She's 25 years old.

16:35.846 --> 16:37.583
It's a chance of a lifetime.

16:38.525 --> 16:39.980
Yeah, sure.

16:39.997 --> 16:42.543
No, hey!
G.G., no, don't pick that up!

16:42.557 --> 16:43.811
I'll be right back.

16:47.608 --> 16:49.453
You can't put Paris in charge.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.701
She can and she should.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.660
Guys, I just need someone to
get the paper out tonight.

16:52.695 --> 16:54.813
Doesn't matter who.
I want the chain of command to be clear.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.941
When the editor in chief isn't here,
the managing editor's in charge.

16:57.957 --> 17:01.000
That's standard operating procedure
at every newspaper in the country.

17:01.016 --> 17:03.070
Yes, but I've done
this 1,000 times,

17:03.085 --> 17:04.443
and you've never done it, Bill.

17:04.455 --> 17:05.540
Experience.

17:05.557 --> 17:07.421
Experience that
led to a mutiny.

17:07.438 --> 17:10.601
It's not like anyone ever gave Captain
Bligh another ship after the Bounty.

17:10.617 --> 17:12.422
Of course they did,
multiple ships,

17:12.438 --> 17:15.031
and by the time he died,
they promoted the guy to rear admiral.

17:15.048 --> 17:17.821
Do you think the british royal navy
ruled the world in the 19th century

17:17.855 --> 17:20.411
by letting that much natural
talent and leadership capability

17:20.426 --> 17:22.361
go to waste just because
a few whiny complainers

17:22.377 --> 17:24.462
wanted more breadfruit
and less scurvy?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.631
Tell me you're not
seriously considering this.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.841
The bunker.
Do you not remember the bunker?

17:28.856 --> 17:31.222
I hardly see how my choice
of workplace is relevant.

17:31.236 --> 17:34.323
There was an insurrection,
a revolt, an uprising.

17:34.337 --> 17:35.482
She was deposed.

17:35.497 --> 17:37.073
See how wordy he is?
He overwrites.

17:37.086 --> 17:39.172
Plus, he's always been
weak with gerunds.

17:39.218 --> 17:40.280
Sorry.

17:41.087 --> 17:42.841
Look, could you guys take
this somewhere else?

17:42.877 --> 17:44.532
Fine. Let's go to my desk.

17:44.548 --> 17:47.711
Your desk? Right, like I'm actually
going to cede home-court advantage.

17:47.725 --> 17:49.132
Oh, for god's sake.

17:49.455 --> 17:50.523
Hey!

17:50.537 --> 17:51.722
We did it, Ace!

17:51.737 --> 17:53.290
- We bought the company!
- What?

17:53.305 --> 17:54.951
It's crazy.
We were just supposed to have breakfast.

17:54.987 --> 17:57.523
Next thing I know, we're sitting there
with lawyers going over contracts.

17:57.555 --> 17:59.963
- Logan, that's amazing.
- I know!

17:59.975 --> 18:02.002
Was it all because of my
breakfast-combo idea?

18:02.018 --> 18:03.902
I'm pretty sure that's
what sealed it.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.523
So, will you come
celebrate with me tonight?

18:05.555 --> 18:08.262
- I already cleared my schedule.
- Great! I'll send a car.

18:08.278 --> 18:10.610
Tonight, you'll be dining
with a captain of industry.

18:10.627 --> 18:12.210
Wow, do you get to
wear a uniform?

18:12.226 --> 18:14.251
I'll have to check the fine print.
Go home, get dressed.

18:14.286 --> 18:15.140
I'll see you soon.

18:15.158 --> 18:16.530
Aye-aye, captain.

18:16.547 --> 18:19.503
Cancel? Well,
I would say that depends.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.800
What exactly is your
feeling about pickles?

18:21.818 --> 18:23.571
Uh-huh, yes, pickles --

18:23.586 --> 18:25.561
gherkins, dills.

18:25.577 --> 18:28.640
For instance, if all the air
around you smelled like pickles

18:28.656 --> 18:30.931
and there was no place to run,
no place to hide,

18:30.946 --> 18:32.883
would you find that bothersome?

18:32.897 --> 18:34.492
Michel, help. Let me in.

18:34.506 --> 18:36.863
No, that is not a metaphor.

18:36.876 --> 18:40.153
Yes, perhaps it would be better
if you checked in tomorrow night.

18:40.168 --> 18:41.613
Uh-huh. Goodbye.

18:41.627 --> 18:45.021
Michel, it's getting in my pores!
My pores are pickling!

18:47.438 --> 18:49.212
Sorry, I didn't mean to
get you out of surgery.

18:49.248 --> 18:51.080
Oh, mock the mask if you wish.

18:51.096 --> 18:52.392
Oh, I will.

18:52.405 --> 18:55.431
One is never too careful with
toxic pollutants in the air.

18:55.448 --> 18:57.923
- Michel, it's just pickles.
- Oh, so they say!

18:57.936 --> 19:00.271
Has anyone ever
seen these pickles?

19:00.285 --> 19:02.640
Who's to say this is not
some sort of chemical weapon

19:02.656 --> 19:04.672
the government is testing
on us behind our backs?

19:04.688 --> 19:05.850
That's a cheery thought.

19:05.866 --> 19:08.192
I have much scarier scenarios
if you want to hear them.

19:08.207 --> 19:09.852
Yeah, maybe later.

19:11.325 --> 19:12.390
Hey.

19:12.435 --> 19:14.853
Wow, the smell is amazingly
not terrible in here.

19:14.865 --> 19:15.833
What'd you do?

19:15.846 --> 19:17.862
Well, after the town meeting,
I decided to make

19:17.878 --> 19:20.381
some baked apples with
cinnamon and nutmeg.

19:20.398 --> 19:23.541
- This is apples and cinnamon?
- Mnh-mnh. The apples failed me.

19:23.556 --> 19:25.741
I mean,
a terrifically famous smell, right?

19:25.757 --> 19:28.390
A powerful tool in the hands
of a real-estate agent.

19:28.407 --> 19:30.061
Against the pickles
-- powerless.

19:30.076 --> 19:31.463
What is it? It makes me happy.

19:31.477 --> 19:35.142
The apples failed. I tried
cheeses and breads and chocolates.

19:35.156 --> 19:37.381
But nothing could mask
the power of the pickles.

19:37.398 --> 19:38.943
You know,
I think my sense of smell is ruined.

19:38.978 --> 19:40.351
The insides of my
nose are burned out.

19:40.385 --> 19:42.871
Then, I decided if you can't beat them,
join them.

19:42.885 --> 19:44.381
Embrace the pickle!

19:44.396 --> 19:45.651
Milton Berle it smells like?

19:45.668 --> 19:47.840
Milton Berle? Are you saying my
kitchen smells like Milton Berle?

19:47.875 --> 19:50.573
Milton Berle,
"Broadway Danny Rose", "Carnegie Deli".

19:51.927 --> 19:53.773
- Pastrami.
- Pastrami!

19:53.786 --> 19:55.192
You want a sandwich?
I'll make you a sandwich.

19:55.225 --> 19:56.383
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

19:56.396 --> 19:59.841
I've got pumpernickel. I've got rye.
I've got this really nice mustard.

19:59.857 --> 20:02.240
I've even got Dr.
Brown's cel-ray soda in the fridge.

20:02.256 --> 20:04.583
Nah, I filled up on lunchables
in the park with Chris and G.G.

20:04.617 --> 20:06.171
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

20:06.187 --> 20:07.131
Lunchables, huh?

20:07.146 --> 20:08.811
Don't judge what you
do not understand.

20:08.828 --> 20:11.541
So, friday afternoon in the
park with Christopher, huh?

20:11.557 --> 20:13.650
Yeah. You know,
I think I will have one.

20:13.857 --> 20:16.090
Soda that tastes like vegetables --
who would have thunk it?

20:16.126 --> 20:18.372
Hey, uh,
this kind of weird thing happened today.

20:18.386 --> 20:19.072
Oh yeah?

20:19.088 --> 20:22.041
So, apparently Sherry is trying to
get back in touch with Christopher.

20:22.056 --> 20:23.572
Sherry "ex-wife" Sherry?

20:23.587 --> 20:26.913
Sherry "abandoned her baby to go live
the life of a bon vivant" Sherry?

20:26.928 --> 20:28.780
The very one.
She wrote him a letter -- "Mea culpa."

20:28.815 --> 20:30.723
Mea culpa,
she's learned the error of her ways.

20:30.736 --> 20:32.543
She wants to get back
in touch with G.G.

20:32.556 --> 20:34.231
Translation --
she wants to get back with Christopher.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.782
No, I don't think so.
She's dating someone.

20:35.815 --> 20:38.363
She's doing downward dog with
some french yoga instructor.

20:38.375 --> 20:41.460
Sherry "mani/pedi twice a
week" Sherry is doing yoga?

20:41.476 --> 20:43.273
Allegedly. Who knows?

20:43.288 --> 20:47.563
But then Chris went on about sending
G.G. to Paris with this 20-year-old nanny

20:47.576 --> 20:49.743
so that G.G.
can reconnect with her mom.

20:49.758 --> 20:52.123
- And you told him that's insane.
- No.

20:52.138 --> 20:53.940
- What? Why not?
- I don't know.

20:53.955 --> 20:56.610
Not saying what I think is not what
I'm known for, if you know what I mean.

20:56.646 --> 20:59.453
No, no, I don't,
it's not what you're known for.

20:59.466 --> 21:03.122
It's what you're not known for.
I mean, it's not what you're not --

21:03.938 --> 21:06.253
- You're usually quite frank.
- I know.

21:06.268 --> 21:08.962
It sounds like you're not quite
comfortable talking to Christopher.

21:08.975 --> 21:11.282
- That's the thing. I am.
- Well, then why didn't you?

21:11.297 --> 21:13.182
Because in my head,
I wasn't talking to Christopher.

21:13.218 --> 21:16.082
In the park, I was talking to Christopher,
but in my head, I was talking to Luke.

21:16.118 --> 21:18.360
Oh, honey, of course you were.

21:18.375 --> 21:21.472
No, I don't mean it like I missed him.
I mean it like

21:21.488 --> 21:24.870
Luke is the one who didn't want me
getting involved in his kid's life,

21:24.885 --> 21:25.853
not Chris.

21:25.866 --> 21:29.151
Chris is open to what I think.
Chris is open to me.

21:29.176 --> 21:30.731
Christopher is not Luke.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.192
Nope, Christopher is not Luke.

21:32.205 --> 21:34.121
Why aren't all nutritious
things in soda form?

21:34.135 --> 21:35.681
That's a good question.

21:35.697 --> 21:38.310
I swear I would eat my vegetables
if only they were fizzy.

21:38.328 --> 21:40.001
Yay, Rory! Hello?

21:40.017 --> 21:41.140
Hey, what's going on?

21:41.158 --> 21:43.181
Uh, well Stars Hollow
smells like pickles.

21:43.198 --> 21:44.202
- Pickles?
- Pickles.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.633
- Pickles pickles?
- Pickles.

21:45.647 --> 21:46.353
Why?

21:46.367 --> 21:48.062
Because a pickle train crashed.

21:48.077 --> 21:51.100
Is this a joke? Is this a long,
boring joke that I'm not going to get?

21:51.115 --> 21:52.831
No, it's no joke.
The town smells like pickles

21:52.868 --> 21:54.372
because a pickle
train was derailed.

21:54.388 --> 21:56.783
A train full of pickles?
Who knew there was such a thing?

21:56.797 --> 21:59.313
Well, pickle-train conductors, for one.
Sounds so fun.

21:59.328 --> 22:01.052
I would've been the greatest
pickle-train conductor.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.753
Can you see me --
"All aboard, you pickles!"

22:03.766 --> 22:05.412
Hmm. Clearly you
missed your calling.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.351
Well, luckily there's you.
You're young, you're clever,

22:07.387 --> 22:09.561
your great pickle-train
conducting hope.

22:09.575 --> 22:10.932
I can't believe
I'm missing this.

22:10.948 --> 22:12.972
Well, you can celebrate next
year on the anniversary.

22:13.006 --> 22:14.150
What's going on with you?

22:14.167 --> 22:16.863
Well, I can't make it to
friday night dinner tonight,

22:16.877 --> 22:18.323
but I have a very good excuse.

22:18.337 --> 22:19.733
Pickle-train
conducting seminar?

22:19.747 --> 22:21.680
- Logan's in town.
- No way!

22:21.696 --> 22:23.990
Yeah, he showed up last night.
It was a total surprise.

22:24.005 --> 22:26.032
I can't believe you let me go on
about pickle-train conducting

22:26.067 --> 22:28.361
- when you had actual news.
- You had news.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.023
Stars Hollow smells
like pickles.

22:30.038 --> 22:33.750
I can completely see that
scrolling along the CNN crawl.

22:33.768 --> 22:35.711
Logan in town is
totally pre-pickle news.

22:35.727 --> 22:37.300
How long is he here for?

22:37.318 --> 22:40.381
6 1/2 more hours.
He flew in yesterday, bought a company,

22:40.395 --> 22:42.280
- and he's flying back out tonight.
- Oh, my god.

22:42.315 --> 22:44.593
What are you guys gonna do with
your precious remaining hours?

22:44.625 --> 22:46.121
- Or don't I want to know?
- Mom!

22:46.138 --> 22:49.071
Well, because you might be
farming rutabagas or something,

22:49.086 --> 22:51.051
and I wouldn't want to
know 'cause -- boring.

22:51.066 --> 22:53.841
Well, tonight I'm meeting him
in Manhattan to celebrate.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.053
Fancy restaurant?

22:55.068 --> 22:57.701
Rutabaga farm, actually.
Oh, but I'm sorry about dinner.

22:57.718 --> 22:59.753
I did not mean to abandon
you in your time of need.

22:59.757 --> 23:02.400
No worries. I'm not gonna be totally
defenseless. I'm bringing your dad.

23:02.438 --> 23:04.032
Really? Wow!

23:04.045 --> 23:06.203
Yeah, thought it was time
he meet the parents.

23:06.216 --> 23:08.153
Okay, that is pre-pickle news,
my friend.

23:08.168 --> 23:10.381
Oh, this conversation's been a disaster,
hasn't it?

23:10.397 --> 23:11.761
- Yes, it has.
- All right.

23:11.776 --> 23:13.861
Bring-bring. Hi, Rory.
How are you?

23:13.878 --> 23:15.160
Hi, mom. Logan's in town.

23:15.178 --> 23:17.160
Oh, my goodness.
That's wonderful.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.472
We're farming rutabagas.

23:18.486 --> 23:20.310
Oh, you're a filthy child.

23:20.328 --> 23:22.503
I will disown you.
Bringing your father to dinner.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.831
Pickles, pickles, pickles,
smell, pickle-train conducting.

23:24.845 --> 23:26.402
- Alas, alack.
- Good talk.

23:26.417 --> 23:28.162
- The best.
- Bye.

23:29.807 --> 23:31.781
Good evening. Can I take that?

23:31.795 --> 23:33.230
Thank you.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.812
Um, I'm just meeting someone.

23:35.827 --> 23:38.381
- Ahoy, my captain of industry!
- Ace!

23:38.396 --> 23:41.773
Hey, where is your uniform?
I was expecting the whole works --

23:41.785 --> 23:44.820
a spiffy hat, shiny shoes,
epaulets with scrambled eggs on them.

23:44.837 --> 23:46.680
Scrambled eggs on my clothes?
What you must think of me.

23:46.716 --> 23:48.463
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

23:48.475 --> 23:50.522
Though I was hoping you'd wear
a nice little sailor's middy.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.733
- You look so cute in a middy.
- Oh, I'd love to wear a middy.

23:52.768 --> 23:54.952
And a little sailor hat,
like the Stay-Puft marshmallow man.

23:54.987 --> 23:57.461
Because who doesn't want to date
a giant humanoid marshmallow?

23:57.475 --> 23:59.283
I'm so proud of you.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.331
- Come on. Our table's over here.
- Okay.

24:03.308 --> 24:05.633
Everybody, I'd like you to
meet my girlfriend, Rory.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.350
Such a pleasure, Rory.
I'm Nick.

24:07.368 --> 24:08.563
- Hi.
- And this is Phillip.

24:08.577 --> 24:10.413
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

24:10.426 --> 24:12.651
And I'm Bobby.
So, so glad you could join us.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.850
Bobby, um... yeah, me too.

24:14.868 --> 24:17.181
I'm so glad I could make it.
How are you?

24:17.197 --> 24:19.923
I'm brilliant, actually.
We had quite a day.

24:19.938 --> 24:21.393
Shall we order another
bottle of champers, boys?

24:21.425 --> 24:22.810
- Absolutely.
- Good. I'm parched.

24:22.825 --> 24:25.681
- Do you drink?
- What? Um, yeah, sure.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.261
Here. Sit, sit.

24:27.276 --> 24:30.193
Oh, food. Let's please get food.
I haven't eaten since the waffles.

24:30.208 --> 24:31.431
Dear god. Did you eat those?

24:31.448 --> 24:32.453
It would have been rude not to.

24:32.485 --> 24:34.051
You eat anything.
You astound me.

24:34.068 --> 24:35.493
You're like a human
garbage disposal.

24:35.526 --> 24:37.512
It's appalling, Phillip.
Really it is.

24:37.525 --> 24:38.900
You know what you should do?
You should go on one

24:38.938 --> 24:40.921
of those American
reality TV series

24:40.937 --> 24:42.483
and showcase your talents.

24:42.495 --> 24:45.092
There are these huge waffles
at the breakfast this morning.

24:45.105 --> 24:47.061
And Phillip ate them.
I'm catching on.

24:47.078 --> 24:48.271
Logan, I know
we're celebrating,

24:48.307 --> 24:50.200
but I'm concerned about our
budget for this project.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.823
From a strictly economic perpective,
do we really want to blow everything

24:52.856 --> 24:54.410
on feeding Phillip tonight?

24:54.428 --> 24:56.430
Somebody's got to
crunch the numbers.

24:56.448 --> 24:58.052
It's true.
The numbers do not crunch themselves.

24:58.087 --> 25:01.003
Ergo, the number
cruncher must be fed.

25:01.815 --> 25:03.752
So, Rory,
I've heard so much about you!

25:03.766 --> 25:04.360
Oh, yeah?

25:04.376 --> 25:06.000
Logan has talked my
ear off about you.

25:06.017 --> 25:07.720
Oh, yeah, yeah. Me too.

25:07.735 --> 25:10.090
He's talked my ear off
about you and all of you.

25:10.107 --> 25:12.553
I mean, I'm practically Van
Gogh from my earlessness.

25:12.567 --> 25:15.201
Did we order champagne, yet?
Logan, your girlfriend must be parched.

25:15.235 --> 25:18.373
Oh, excuse me, miss. I think we'd
like another bottle, please.

25:18.385 --> 25:20.141
Oh, and bring
another bread plate.

25:20.596 --> 25:21.983
You're amazing.

25:21.997 --> 25:23.621
- Ridiculous.
- I'm hungry.

25:26.676 --> 25:30.301
Oh, no.
You know my rule about hair bands.

25:30.317 --> 25:32.310
My car, my tunes.

25:32.328 --> 25:34.522
Really? You're
gonna say, "tunes"?

25:34.535 --> 25:36.153
You got a lot of rules, lady.

25:36.166 --> 25:39.123
Not a lot. It's just no saying
"killer," no saying "wack,"

25:39.136 --> 25:41.952
no saying "rockin'" or "pimping"
or "slamming," capisce?

25:41.968 --> 25:43.161
Fo' shizzle.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.001
There's got to be an eject
button here somewhere.

25:45.036 --> 25:47.782
How's this for an idea --
weekend away, the two of us?

25:47.798 --> 25:49.741
That's great for an idea.
Ooh! Ooh!

25:49.755 --> 25:51.163
I know the perfect place.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.022
Don't say "Dollywood."
Please, don't, don't say "Dollywood."

25:54.036 --> 25:56.232
- The ice hotel.
- The what?

25:56.247 --> 25:57.782
The ice hotel. It's amazing.

25:57.797 --> 25:59.221
I read about it in
the travel section.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.762
It's a hotel totally made of ice.
The roof is ice. The floors are ice.

26:01.796 --> 26:04.853
The tables are ice. The chairs are ice.
Chandeliers are ice.

26:04.865 --> 26:06.240
I think I'm beginning
to get the picture.

26:06.278 --> 26:07.970
Wouldn't it be amazing if
you went down the hall

26:08.007 --> 26:09.441
and the ice machine was empty?

26:09.455 --> 26:10.860
It is amazing.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.302
Amazingly cold.

26:12.317 --> 26:14.802
No. You get to wear
parkas and fur hats.

26:14.815 --> 26:15.591
"Get to"?

26:15.605 --> 26:18.452
And you sleep under reindeer skins.
You eat reindeer meat.

26:18.465 --> 26:19.773
Again, "get to"?

26:19.785 --> 26:21.732
You drink vodka.
That's a good "get to."

26:21.747 --> 26:25.433
Hey, how's this for an idea?
We can drink vodka in Bermuda.

26:25.446 --> 26:28.112
The ice hotel in Bermuda
would totally melt.

26:28.126 --> 26:30.240
We'll do two weekends away.
First the ice hotel.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.950
Then once we've been
treated for frostbite

26:31.965 --> 26:33.781
and had our stomachs
pumped of reindeer meat,

26:33.797 --> 26:35.981
we'll go defrost on
a beach somewhere.

26:35.998 --> 26:39.260
I mean, we've got the time. G.G.'s gonna
be in Paris for a couple of months.

26:42.285 --> 26:44.261
What? You're not down with
the whole beach thing?

26:44.276 --> 26:48.940
No, it's...
more the whole Paris thing.

26:48.956 --> 26:50.603
Yes?

26:50.628 --> 26:56.612
I-I'm just... I'm not sure it's such
a good idea that G.G. goes to Paris.

26:56.776 --> 26:58.142
Meaning?

26:58.157 --> 27:00.401
Well, she's only 4 years old.

27:00.415 --> 27:03.021
She barely even knows Sherry.

27:03.035 --> 27:05.043
Yeah, but Sherry's her mother.

27:05.055 --> 27:07.011
A mother she hasn't
seen in two years.

27:07.027 --> 27:09.462
Look, Sherry's doing really well.
You read her letter.

27:09.478 --> 27:11.673
And I think I've been doing
a really good job with G.G.

27:11.687 --> 27:13.731
Oh, honey. Amazing.

27:13.748 --> 27:14.920
But it's hard, you know?

27:14.936 --> 27:18.072
It's -- It's really hard, and G.G.
needs her mom.

27:18.088 --> 27:20.012
And if I can help bring
them both back together,

27:20.026 --> 27:22.392
I want to do that.
I have to do that.

27:22.405 --> 27:24.901
I know, I get that. I just --

27:24.915 --> 27:27.191
I think maybe you should put
a little more thought into it,

27:27.227 --> 27:29.913
you know, before you send 
a toddler on an airplane

27:29.926 --> 27:32.770
with an 18-year-old nanny who's
totally psyched to go to France.

27:32.787 --> 27:35.532
- The nanny's 25.
- Oh, oh, okay, then.

27:35.546 --> 27:37.511
Like the nanny's really
your problem here.

27:37.526 --> 27:39.851
Well, I mean,
it's not an un-problem, you know?

27:39.867 --> 27:42.001
I think you should just
consider it more carefully

27:42.018 --> 27:43.510
or maybe go yourself.

27:43.526 --> 27:45.932
- Look, I read her letter --
- Oh, my god! Enough!

27:45.947 --> 27:48.052
Enough with the letter already.

27:50.807 --> 27:52.210
I get it.

27:52.625 --> 27:53.972
What do you get?

27:53.987 --> 27:55.733
This is about you being
threatened by Sherry.

27:55.768 --> 27:57.732
No, no. Give me a break.

27:57.746 --> 27:59.092
- You never liked her.
- No, I didn't.

27:59.126 --> 28:01.371
But I don't like the new mailman either.
Doesn't mean I'm threatened by him.

28:01.405 --> 28:03.891
That's not what this is about.
This is about me thinking I could speak

28:03.926 --> 28:05.842
openly and honestly
about my concerns

28:05.855 --> 28:07.541
without getting freaked out on.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.112
Nice. Real nice.

28:09.127 --> 28:10.390
Honey, what is
going on with you?

28:10.428 --> 28:12.012
What's going on with you, Lor?

28:12.025 --> 28:15.083
Look, can we drop this, please,
and try and have a nice evening?

28:15.097 --> 28:16.530
It's dropped.

28:16.798 --> 28:20.102
Well, hello, hello!
Richard, they're here.

28:20.117 --> 28:21.781
Don't you two look marvelous?

28:21.797 --> 28:24.263
Well, don't just stand there.
Come in, come in.

28:27.066 --> 28:29.503
It was the way he kept saying
"intellectual property."

28:29.515 --> 28:31.902
I could feel the whole deal just
slipping through our fingers.

28:31.937 --> 28:34.402
He was like, "intellectual property.
Intellectual property."

28:34.417 --> 28:36.541
"Which is like my property,
my property."

28:36.555 --> 28:37.902
"I invented it, I invented it."

28:37.916 --> 28:39.161
"We won't sell, we won't sell."

28:39.176 --> 28:40.720
"And it's slipping. Slipping."

28:40.738 --> 28:43.722
I'm looking at Nick trying to convey
through subtle dilations of my pupils

28:43.738 --> 28:45.652
that we cannot offer
any more money.

28:45.665 --> 28:47.832
And I'm looking at Phillip
who's looking at me like,

28:47.845 --> 28:50.162
like he's hopped up on some
sort of methamphetamine.

28:50.176 --> 28:53.972
Slipping, slipping, and it looks
like we lost him, and then Bobby.

28:53.986 --> 28:56.521
- Bobby makes a bold choice.
- What does she do?

28:56.536 --> 28:57.931
- She just stands up.
- She does.

28:57.948 --> 28:59.750
- She just stands up!
- Wow.

28:59.765 --> 29:01.703
She stands up like she can't
take it anymore, and she says,

29:01.736 --> 29:03.330
"meeting's over, boys."

29:03.347 --> 29:05.771
- That must have been crazy.
- It was amazing.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.470
I'm sitting here, and she's here,
and she stands up.

29:08.488 --> 29:10.971
And I look over,
and all I see is legs, legs, legs

29:10.985 --> 29:13.711
and this look on her
face like "ohh, no."

29:13.725 --> 29:15.781
It was brilliant.
Do it, Bobby. Stand up.

29:15.798 --> 29:17.993
- Knock it off.
- Come on, Bobby. You got to see this.

29:18.008 --> 29:19.650
- But we insist.
- Please?

29:19.667 --> 29:22.060
Fine. But just to
shut you lot up.

29:22.076 --> 29:24.461
I suppose it was
something like, um...

29:26.657 --> 29:28.473
...meeting's over, boys.

29:28.488 --> 29:31.392
Whoo! Well done!

29:31.406 --> 29:33.860
- Amazing, huh?
- We need another bottle!

29:33.878 --> 29:36.372
And dessert. Don't we need
a little sweet or something?

29:36.385 --> 29:38.800
So, Rory, we've barely had the
opportunity to speak all night.

29:38.836 --> 29:40.791
- I know.
- How's school? What's your major?

29:40.805 --> 29:43.162
- English.
- Oh, god, how fantastic.

29:43.176 --> 29:45.652
I swear when I was at Oxford,
I did nothing but read literature.

29:45.685 --> 29:47.151
It was such a luxury.

29:47.165 --> 29:49.951
- That's one way to look at it.
- Oh, I long for those days.

29:49.967 --> 29:52.140
Just reading books, thinking.

29:52.158 --> 29:54.282
- I do like thinking.
- Enjoy it while it lasts.

29:54.297 --> 29:56.672
Before you know it, you'll be out in
the real world with the rest of us.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.661
Seems like you manage
to have some fun.

29:58.677 --> 30:02.212
Well, Logan is a big part of that.
He is such a laugh.

30:02.227 --> 30:04.713
He's actually a lot more
serious than you might think.

30:04.727 --> 30:07.802
It probably takes a long time to
get to know that side of him,

30:07.818 --> 30:08.952
the serious side.

30:08.967 --> 30:11.331
Oh, you two are so adorable.

30:11.348 --> 30:12.962
- Thanks.
- Hey, not so fast!

30:12.978 --> 30:14.540
We're still working on
getting the next round.

30:14.577 --> 30:16.332
Another sloe gin fizz, please.

30:16.345 --> 30:17.993
Oh, and don't get
too excited, fellas.

30:18.007 --> 30:19.592
I'm just going to the loo.

30:19.608 --> 30:22.270
- Yes! That's it!
- Amazing! Magnificent!

30:22.287 --> 30:24.563
- We fold, we fold.
- Thank you, thank you very much.

30:24.576 --> 30:28.423
And feel free to say all sorts of
cheeky things about me while I'm gone.

30:28.448 --> 30:30.290
Isn't she a riot?

30:30.308 --> 30:31.913
Hilarious.

30:32.348 --> 30:35.412
Well, naturally I thought they
were referring to the archduke.

30:35.425 --> 30:37.352
So I jumped in,
as who wouldn't?

30:37.367 --> 30:39.732
With some thoughts about the
various conspiracy theories

30:39.746 --> 30:43.291
surrounding his infamous
assassination in Sarajevo.

30:43.308 --> 30:45.603
Imagine my surprise when I
learned that Franz Ferdinand

30:45.617 --> 30:48.892
was the name of a very
popular rock-'n'-roll band.

30:49.936 --> 30:53.191
That's what he gets for trying to
fraternize after class with his students.

30:53.208 --> 30:55.882
One of them even offered
to burn a CD for me.

30:56.765 --> 30:58.490
So, tell me.
How are the salads?

30:58.508 --> 30:59.522
Good, mom.

30:59.535 --> 31:01.183
- I like the pear.
- Do you?

31:01.197 --> 31:03.453
- I'm so glad.
- Tastes very fresh.

31:03.467 --> 31:06.120
Well, pears this time of
year can dress up any salad.

31:06.137 --> 31:08.282
Oh, Richard,
did you tell them about midterms?

31:08.298 --> 31:10.410
Lorelai, did your father
mention midterms?

31:10.427 --> 31:12.511
No, he didn't.
How were midterms, dad?

31:12.526 --> 31:15.340
As you know, midterms separate
the wheat from the chaff.

31:15.355 --> 31:17.823
although I don't have to grade
any of their papers or tests.

31:17.835 --> 31:19.793
They have these marvelous
teaching assistants

31:19.805 --> 31:22.141
that handle all that
sort of things for you.

31:22.456 --> 31:23.811
Thank you, Hildegard.

31:23.825 --> 31:25.512
Christopher, I hope
you like lamb.

31:25.527 --> 31:27.490
When I found out that you were coming,
I decided we had to serve

31:27.525 --> 31:30.413
something special.
And to me, special means lamb.

31:30.427 --> 31:33.193
Oh, it just makes me so happy to see
the two of you sitting here together.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.520
It's such fun.

31:34.537 --> 31:36.173
It's very nice to be here.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.073
- Tennis!
- Emily?

31:38.088 --> 31:40.262
That's one of the things we
can do together as a foursome,

31:40.298 --> 31:42.580
now that Lorelai and
Christopher are an item.

31:42.595 --> 31:45.193
That's right.
We do need new people for doubles.

31:45.208 --> 31:47.291
We've been playing with
that awful Bunny Ferguson

31:47.305 --> 31:49.053
And her husband,
whatever his name is.

31:49.066 --> 31:50.033
They are dreadful.

31:50.046 --> 31:52.302
The way Bunny Ferguson
grunts -- oh!

31:52.317 --> 31:54.653
I mean, it's one thing 
if you're Maria Sharapova

31:54.668 --> 31:58.022
and you're 120 pounds and
a 7-foot blond teenager.

31:58.038 --> 32:00.640
- But if you're 5'3"...
- And 53...

32:00.657 --> 32:02.073
And wearing plaid --

32:02.085 --> 32:04.373
Did you see that skirt she wore
the last time we played them?

32:04.407 --> 32:05.973
I can only think
that it was designed

32:05.985 --> 32:07.923
to cause some sort of
optic misfunction.

32:07.938 --> 32:09.892
Then you'll play with us?

32:09.906 --> 32:11.093
Lorelai?

32:11.106 --> 32:12.390
Hmm? Yes, fine, great.

32:12.407 --> 32:13.392
It's a date.

32:13.406 --> 32:16.121
How does the saturday after
next work for everyone?

32:16.137 --> 32:17.280
Sure.

32:17.298 --> 32:18.773
Ah, here's the lamb.

32:18.786 --> 32:21.642
You do like lamb, Christopher?
I'm afraid I never let you answer.

32:21.655 --> 32:24.281
I do. The funny thing is,
I never did when I was a kid,

32:24.295 --> 32:27.831
but I do now. I guess I've changed.
People do that sometimes.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.030
That's so true.

32:29.046 --> 32:31.950
What a clever observation.
It's like you and radishes.

32:31.967 --> 32:32.671
Exactly.

32:32.686 --> 32:34.950
Your father used to hate radishes.
Thought they were disgusting.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.262
Well, they are roots.
It's a little unappealing.

32:37.275 --> 32:39.582
And then one summer in Aspen,
he fell off a horse,

32:39.595 --> 32:42.772
and suddenly he loved radishes.
That whole summer, he was radish-crazy.

32:42.788 --> 32:45.423
It's true.
I do like radishes to this day.

32:45.438 --> 32:47.290
- That's funny.
- Isn't it?

32:47.305 --> 32:49.011
Yes. I don't like radishes.

32:49.027 --> 32:51.313
I guess it's because I
find them threatening.

32:51.325 --> 32:52.643
What a peculiar thing to say.

32:52.657 --> 32:54.501
Radishes are a peculiar topic.

32:54.515 --> 32:55.811
All right.

32:55.827 --> 32:57.902
Since this is a special
occasion of sorts,

32:57.916 --> 33:00.071
I should like to
propose a toast.

33:00.088 --> 33:01.910
To many more nights like this,

33:01.926 --> 33:03.853
and to Lorelai and Christopher.

33:03.865 --> 33:07.090
Who knew 20-some-odd years ago
that we would be making dates

33:07.107 --> 33:08.911
- to play doubles tennis?
- And bridge.

33:08.926 --> 33:10.850
You absolutely have to
join us for bridge.

33:10.867 --> 33:14.093
You two have come a long way since
your days of rebellious youth,

33:14.107 --> 33:15.233
shall we say?

33:15.248 --> 33:17.052
Derelicts. The
word is derelicts.

33:17.066 --> 33:18.253
Emily!

33:18.268 --> 33:20.561
To Lorelai and Christopher.

33:24.768 --> 33:27.170
They were derelicts. It's true.

33:27.185 --> 33:30.840
Remember when they stole that bottle of
wine you'd been saving for 15 years?

33:30.858 --> 33:33.853
Well, 10 years.
It was a '75 Margot.

33:33.866 --> 33:35.802
And they had no idea
how to use a corkscrew,

33:35.815 --> 33:37.673
so they just cracked
the top off with a brick

33:37.687 --> 33:39.563
and slurped what they
could off the patio.

33:39.575 --> 33:40.940
And look at them now.

33:40.957 --> 33:44.122
All grown up and drinking
very nicely out of glasses.

33:44.138 --> 33:45.823
I need to see you
in the bathroom.

33:45.836 --> 33:47.141
Fine.

33:47.157 --> 33:48.390
Excuse me.

33:57.386 --> 33:59.082
Would you mind telling
me what the hell --

33:59.096 --> 34:00.491
- You're not Sherry.
- Excuse me?

34:00.507 --> 34:02.001
You've changed, Chris.

34:02.017 --> 34:03.212
What are you talking about?

34:03.228 --> 34:05.042
Maybe we were
derelicts back then.

34:05.055 --> 34:07.172
But we were 16.
We were just kids.

34:07.185 --> 34:08.650
- You were just a kid.
- So?

34:08.666 --> 34:12.090
So, you leaving Rory when you
were 16 is not at all the same

34:12.105 --> 34:15.231
as Sherry, a grown woman,
packing up and living G.G.

34:15.246 --> 34:16.802
So I get why you
were upset with me.

34:16.818 --> 34:20.023
Because when I'm criticizing Sherry,
you feel like I'm criticizing you.

34:20.034 --> 34:21.702
But I wasn't. I'm not.

34:21.716 --> 34:24.522
You've changed. You're not 16.
You're not a kid.

34:24.536 --> 34:25.933
You're not Sherry. I get it.

34:25.947 --> 34:28.072
Wow, you get it.
That's great, Lor.

34:28.085 --> 34:31.002
Thanks for telling
me how I feel.

34:38.757 --> 34:40.723
- You tired?
- I'm good.

34:40.735 --> 34:43.291
I could always have the car
come pick us up at the corner.

34:43.308 --> 34:44.400
I'm fine.

34:44.417 --> 34:46.270
Hey, I know. I could carry you.

34:46.286 --> 34:47.670
- Carry me?
- Yeah.

34:47.687 --> 34:50.489
Piggyback, fireman's carry,
in both arms -- your choice.

34:50.505 --> 34:51.693
No.

34:51.706 --> 34:53.541
I'm really fine.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.852
Wow, okay.
So, I guess something's really wrong.

34:57.866 --> 34:59.932
Just because I don't want
to be fireman carried

34:59.945 --> 35:01.591
doesn't mean that
something is wrong.

35:01.608 --> 35:04.382
- But something is wrong.
- No, it's just --

35:04.395 --> 35:06.120
Just?

35:06.935 --> 35:11.811
This isn't exactly what
I expected tonight.

35:11.826 --> 35:14.402
I was just a little confused,
I guess.

35:14.416 --> 35:17.190
You called. You were so excited.
You said, "celebrate."

35:17.205 --> 35:20.033
I thought it was
gonna be just us.

35:20.048 --> 35:21.293
Last night was just us.

35:21.305 --> 35:25.603
I know,
and it was also perfect and romantic.

35:25.618 --> 35:29.853
And the more I talk about it, the more
I feel stupid for even bringing this up.

35:29.867 --> 35:32.381
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't
clear on the phone.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.400
I'm sorry that you didn't
have a good time tonight.

35:34.435 --> 35:38.160
Well, no, it's not that. I mean,
I get it. The guys are great. Okay.

35:38.177 --> 35:42.991
But, technically Bobby, well,
she's not exactly a guy.

35:43.006 --> 35:44.730
Yeah, you got me there.

35:44.747 --> 35:48.251
And until about three hours ago,
I thought that she was a guy.

35:48.265 --> 35:49.263
You know why?

35:49.275 --> 35:52.170
Because you never use personal
pronouns -- "She," "her."

35:52.186 --> 35:54.151
I mean, would that have been
so unbelievably difficult

35:54.188 --> 35:55.880
to fit into a conversation?

35:55.897 --> 35:59.742
I don't know about you, but most
of the Bobbys I know are guys --

35:59.756 --> 36:04.021
Bobby Kennedy, Bobby Brady,
Bobby Knight, Bobby Brown.

36:04.037 --> 36:06.183
You're smiling at me.
Why are smiling at me?

36:06.195 --> 36:08.120
Because you are very cute
when you're jealous.

36:08.138 --> 36:09.633
- I'm not jealous.
- Rory.

36:09.647 --> 36:13.061
Oh, and it's not just that.
I mean, it was everything.

36:13.078 --> 36:16.592
It was not feeling
like I was included.

36:16.606 --> 36:19.303
I mean, no one all night
asked me anything about me.

36:19.316 --> 36:20.470
Bobby asked you about you.

36:20.487 --> 36:22.581
Yeah, and how
condescending was she?

36:22.596 --> 36:25.251
"It's such a luxury
to read literature."

36:25.268 --> 36:26.622
And did you hear
what she called us?

36:26.655 --> 36:29.432
"Adorable." She called
us an adorable couple.

36:29.447 --> 36:32.312
- Wait, she said that out loud?
- Yes, adorable.

36:32.328 --> 36:34.082
Wow, you want me to go back
there and kick her ass?

36:34.116 --> 36:36.892
"Adorable" is what you say
about a "Full House" rerun.

36:36.905 --> 36:39.321
It's not what you say
about something that lasts.

36:39.336 --> 36:41.842
The great wall of China, the pyramids --
no one ever called them "adorable."

36:41.878 --> 36:45.760
And excuse me, but how many times does
a girl need to stand up at dinner?

36:45.778 --> 36:47.851
Yes, you have legs. We get it.

36:47.868 --> 36:50.743
"Oh, no, I'm not leaving.
I'm just going to the loo."

36:50.757 --> 36:53.352
Here's a tip. You're in america now.
Speak english.

36:53.365 --> 36:56.063
Okay, so just to clarify,
in the future, you would prefer

36:56.075 --> 36:57.903
I work only with girls
who have no legs.

36:57.915 --> 36:59.550
You're not taking me seriously.

36:59.568 --> 37:01.162
Because you're
not being serious.

37:01.176 --> 37:03.732
Bobby is my colleague.
She's great at what she does.

37:03.747 --> 37:06.261
She's smart. She's talented.
Nick has great legs, too.

37:06.276 --> 37:08.260
Maybe before you rush to judgment,
you should check his out.

37:08.296 --> 37:12.322
Great. So now I'm not just an idiot,
I'm an anti-feminist idiot,

37:12.335 --> 37:15.052
an anti-feminist who's
standing here in the street

37:15.065 --> 37:17.723
arguing about things I don't
really want to be arguing about.

37:17.737 --> 37:18.711
- You don't?
- No.

37:18.727 --> 37:20.831
Do you think I like
feeling this way?

37:20.847 --> 37:22.721
I mean, I haven't seen
you for months and months,

37:22.758 --> 37:25.752
and now you're in town for what?
26 hours?

37:25.766 --> 37:29.663
And in that time, I can't just get
happy and act like a fruit fly?

37:29.677 --> 37:30.921
Mayfly.

37:30.937 --> 37:34.763
I can't just live in the moment and
enjoy the 26 great hours ahead of me?

37:34.777 --> 37:37.762
I have to be sulky and miserable
while all the other fruit flies

37:37.778 --> 37:40.063
share private jokes
with my boyfriend?

37:40.078 --> 37:42.270
You think I like this
about myself? Wrong.

37:42.285 --> 37:43.862
I hate myself for
being this way.

37:43.877 --> 37:46.353
I hate Bobby for her
professionally tweezed eyebrows

37:46.368 --> 37:50.132
and her oh-so-incredible ability
to stand up at a moment's notice.

37:50.148 --> 37:52.570
And most of all,
I hate the fact that in a few seconds

37:52.588 --> 37:54.872
you'll be in that
car leaving me again.

37:54.888 --> 37:58.203
That is a hell of a long way to
go just to say, "I miss you."

37:58.216 --> 37:59.862
Any thoughts in response?

37:59.877 --> 38:01.870
I miss you, too, Ace.

38:02.728 --> 38:05.633
Five words.
You only used five words.

38:05.645 --> 38:07.642
Yeah, well, I'm not done yet.

38:15.735 --> 38:17.950
Of course, this time of year,
so many people start playing

38:17.986 --> 38:21.742
that awful winter tennis with the
chicken-wire cages and the heated courts.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.123
Platform tennis can be
very enjoyable, Emily.

38:24.138 --> 38:27.262
Yes, but it looks ridiculous,
like glorified ping-pong.

38:27.276 --> 38:29.953
If I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would --

38:29.988 --> 38:32.872
Well, if I wanted to play ping-pong,
I would kill myself.

38:32.888 --> 38:35.682
Well, I hope you're still good
with a racket, Christopher.

38:35.698 --> 38:37.181
Lorelai was always hopeless.

38:37.196 --> 38:40.480
As a child, we took her to an
ophthalmologist to test her
depth perception.

38:40.496 --> 38:42.602
He could find no
rational reason for it.

38:42.615 --> 38:43.981
I know I'm not Sherry.

38:43.998 --> 38:46.690
I'm sorry. Did he serve you Sherry?
Richard, there's been some mistake.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.393
Christopher's drink was
supposed to be port.

38:48.428 --> 38:50.092
Come to Paris with me.

38:50.105 --> 38:51.643
- What?
- You were right.

38:51.656 --> 38:53.933
I should take G.G.
myself, check everything out.

38:53.945 --> 38:55.120
Check what out?

38:55.136 --> 38:57.331
Paris. I think they want
to check out Paris.

38:57.347 --> 38:59.673
Come on. You can't say "no." I mean,
you can, but don't.

38:59.685 --> 39:03.800
Maybe there's even a Parisian
ice hotel we can stay in.

39:03.818 --> 39:06.382
Yes. I mean, no,
there is no ice hotel.

39:06.397 --> 39:08.391
But I'll stay in one
made of stone or bricks

39:08.407 --> 39:10.113
or whatever Paris
hotels are made of.

39:10.126 --> 39:12.881
We can blast the air-conditioning
and drink all the vodka you want.

39:12.898 --> 39:15.121
- What on earth --
- That sounds great.

39:15.135 --> 39:17.120
What happened when you
went to the powder room?

39:17.135 --> 39:18.670
One minute,
we're sitting here having dessert.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.171
And the next,
you're talking about Paris.

39:20.206 --> 39:22.573
Well, Chris and I
are going to Paris.

39:22.585 --> 39:24.021
In just a couple of
weeks, actually.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.803
I'm so sorry we're gonna have to take
a rain check on that tennis date.

39:26.838 --> 39:30.001
Yeah, till the 12th of never 'cause we
wouldn't play tennis or golf or bridge

39:30.015 --> 39:32.452
or any game that could be
played in a foursome --

39:32.467 --> 39:34.371
except hangman and
sometimes pictionary.

39:34.385 --> 39:37.090
What has gotten into you?
You were being so pleasant all evening.

39:37.107 --> 39:39.673
Mmm, what is this?
This looks good.

39:39.685 --> 39:42.862
"What is it"? I told you 20 minutes ago.
It was rhubarb pie.

39:42.878 --> 39:44.852
Hmm. Is it still rhubarb pie?

39:44.866 --> 39:47.312
I swear I was having
the most wonderful time.

39:47.327 --> 39:48.842
Is rhubarb a root, dad?

39:48.855 --> 39:49.972
No.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.121
- Hi, everyone.
- Honey!

39:53.005 --> 39:55.173
- Hey.
- Am I late?

39:55.188 --> 39:56.713
Of course not, Rory.

39:56.725 --> 39:59.243
You're just in time
for rooty rhubarb pie,

39:59.257 --> 40:02.473
and for the viewing
of mom's mug shot.

40:02.485 --> 40:03.531
Rory, stop her.

40:03.546 --> 40:05.192
I'm sure you look
very nice, grandma.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.881
You are very photogenic, Emily.

40:06.898 --> 40:09.700
Ooh! What am I saying?
I have pictures on my phone.

40:09.715 --> 40:11.501
Gather 'round the
phone, everybody.

40:11.517 --> 40:12.963
Richard, what are you doing?

40:12.977 --> 40:14.421
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

40:15.045 --> 40:18.370
Oh! These new
phones are amazing.

40:18.387 --> 40:20.503
Are those handcuffs?
Grandma, are you wearing handcuffs?

40:20.538 --> 40:21.850
I certainly was not.

40:21.868 --> 40:23.562
No, they gave her one of
those ankle things instead

40:23.597 --> 40:25.352
with like a chain and
cannonball on the end.

40:25.366 --> 40:26.270
Christopher!

40:26.285 --> 40:28.310
Oh, and the stripy outfit.
Tell Rory how they made you wear

40:28.346 --> 40:29.883
the stripy outfit, mom.

40:33.137 --> 40:34.762
No.

40:38.488 --> 40:39.951
No!

40:42.688 --> 40:44.280
- No!
- No!

40:46.616 --> 40:48.603
- Yeah, yeah, that one!
- Yeah! Stop there!

41:05.528 --> 41:08.700
