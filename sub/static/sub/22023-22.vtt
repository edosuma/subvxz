WEBVTT

00:00.148 --> 00:01.214
I've got three rules.

00:01.867 --> 00:03.067
Don't date co-workers,

00:03.366 --> 00:05.332
don't move in with co-workers you date,

00:05.745 --> 00:08.945
and don't dump co-workers
you live with and date.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.266
Can I move back in with you?

00:13.577 --> 00:14.352
Ugh.

00:15.873 --> 00:19.002
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

00:20.809 --> 00:23.135
So, Neil Penderson, that's our CEO,

00:23.174 --> 00:25.242
will speak first, followed by Glenn,

00:25.674 --> 00:28.374
and then Neil will take
a few more questions.

00:28.443 --> 00:30.276
Let's try and remember
this event is going to be

00:30.278 --> 00:32.363
live-streamed, so...

00:32.363 --> 00:34.735
let's try to avoid anything
controversial, okay?

00:34.868 --> 00:36.583
Laurie, by live-stream

00:36.651 --> 00:38.218
do you mean in the conventional sense,

00:38.286 --> 00:39.919
like running water or...

00:39.955 --> 00:41.573
No, I mean you're going to be filmed

00:41.574 --> 00:43.740
and then broadcast live
to all of our stores.

00:44.250 --> 00:44.891
Oh!

00:44.960 --> 00:46.548
I'm sorry, isn't the whole point

00:46.549 --> 00:48.704
of a town hall that
you can ask anything?

00:48.705 --> 00:50.929
Oh, no, Jonah, are you
upset because they told you

00:50.999 --> 00:53.853
it was one thing then yanked
the rug out from under you?

00:53.854 --> 00:56.217
Ohhhh.

00:56.218 --> 00:57.720
When you say all of the stores,

00:57.806 --> 01:00.096
do you mean all the stores
in the St. Louis area...

01:00.097 --> 01:02.275
I mean all of our stores
across the globe.

01:02.760 --> 01:03.387
So, Earth.

01:04.799 --> 01:05.525
That's fun.

01:05.525 --> 01:07.514
Ooh, I'm going to ask
what's the craziest

01:07.582 --> 01:09.015
rich person thing he's ever done.

01:09.084 --> 01:10.583
I bet it's something like

01:10.652 --> 01:12.819
blowing up a cow with a bazooka,

01:12.888 --> 01:14.308
or hunting a person.

01:14.309 --> 01:16.765
Oh, that dude's definitely
played the most dangerous game.

01:16.766 --> 01:18.566
I'm... going to...

01:18.567 --> 01:20.624
add that area to this list.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.529
Uh, why can't we talk about Myrtle?

01:22.530 --> 01:24.764
Uh, because we had to fire Myrtle.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.014
So we don't need people asking
those kinds of questions.

01:27.015 --> 01:28.377
What kind of questions?

01:28.870 --> 01:30.336
You know, who knows?

01:30.422 --> 01:33.292
We're not hiding anything,
so I really couldn't guess.

01:34.209 --> 01:36.613
7.594 billion people.

01:37.779 --> 01:40.330
How are we not sinking?
I feel like I'm sinking.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.328
Oh. Hi.

01:51.292 --> 01:51.731
Hi.

01:53.728 --> 01:54.721
What are you doing in here?

01:54.722 --> 01:56.963
I'm guessing the same thing as you?

01:57.032 --> 01:58.731
Oh, right, 'cause you know me so well.

01:59.431 --> 02:02.155
Okay, fine, what Laurie said
about firing Myrtle was weird,

02:02.171 --> 02:03.536
so I thought I'd check her file.

02:03.605 --> 02:04.737
What are you doing?

02:05.342 --> 02:06.175
Same thing.

02:06.875 --> 02:09.442
Well, I think I can handle it, so...

02:09.478 --> 02:10.710
Well, you don't know where it is.

02:10.725 --> 02:11.791
It's alphabetical.

02:11.947 --> 02:13.680
Do you know her last name?

02:16.223 --> 02:18.685
Or were you just checking
under "M" for Myrtle.

02:18.753 --> 02:21.772
She's in my phone as "Myrtle Old."

02:21.850 --> 02:24.607
Hmm. Yeah, check "O" for Old.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:35.237 --> 02:36.886
That's too many of those things.

02:36.972 --> 02:39.372
It's medicine. You can't have too many.

02:39.741 --> 02:40.889
Everything okay?

02:41.136 --> 02:44.304
Do you know how many
countries we have stores in?

02:44.546 --> 02:47.814
China, France, India, Mexico.

02:47.882 --> 02:50.083
That's most of the Small World ride.

02:50.151 --> 02:51.449
Yeah, but the only people
who are going to see it

02:51.450 --> 02:54.940
are Cloud 9 employees and the
customers that happen to be there.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.705
Yeah, I guess that's true.

02:56.706 --> 02:57.815
And even if there's, like,

02:57.816 --> 03:00.316
a hundred people watching in each store,

03:00.317 --> 03:01.546
how many stores are there world-wide?

03:01.547 --> 03:03.174
I don't know, maybe 1,800.

03:03.175 --> 03:06.299
Right, so that's
like only 180,000 people.

03:07.002 --> 03:09.377
Which is actually
a large number of people.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.413
You're not helping.

03:12.131 --> 03:15.375
Repeated absences,
bad attitude, insubordination.

03:15.443 --> 03:16.908
I'm surprised Myrtle
wasn't fired sooner.

03:16.909 --> 03:18.072
No, look at these dates.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.346
All of these are within
the last six months.

03:20.414 --> 03:23.029
What... she just goes 30 years
without a single write-up

03:23.030 --> 03:24.984
and overnight gets bad at her job?

03:25.053 --> 03:27.248
Well, she was not great.

03:27.429 --> 03:29.511
No, I know, she's been
not great at her job

03:29.512 --> 03:31.396
for 30 years, so why all of a sudden

03:31.397 --> 03:32.592
is Glenn writing her up?

03:32.627 --> 03:33.929
It's not Glenn.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.892
Jeff Sutton, Jeff Sutton, Jeff Sutton.

03:37.330 --> 03:40.166
Since when does a district
manager write up floor workers?

03:40.235 --> 03:41.868
We have to talk to Jeff.

03:41.936 --> 03:44.003
Or I have to talk to Jeff.

03:44.072 --> 03:45.271
Well, I want to talk to him too.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.439
Well, you can talk to whoever you want.

03:46.524 --> 03:48.508
I'm not in charge of who you talk to.

03:48.972 --> 03:50.510
Jonah's a jerk, by the way.

03:50.858 --> 03:52.524
You deserve so much better.

03:53.348 --> 03:55.754
Thanks. I appreciate that.

03:56.393 --> 03:58.620
So what are we going to do to him?

03:59.020 --> 04:00.692
Revenge porn on the Internet?

04:01.156 --> 04:03.004
Give his credit card info to a bum?

04:05.060 --> 04:05.747
Or...

04:06.628 --> 04:09.314
maybe someone tells the
cops he's cooking meth.

04:09.964 --> 04:11.872
Then, uh-oh, there's an ounce of it

04:11.874 --> 04:13.261
found in his sock drawer.

04:13.408 --> 04:14.941
How'd that get there?

04:15.236 --> 04:17.637
Wow, that's aggressive.

04:17.706 --> 04:19.805
Or he's got two brothers.

04:19.874 --> 04:22.141
Be a shame if something
happened to them.

04:22.142 --> 04:23.471
Then he'd be all alone.

04:24.145 --> 04:24.853
Well...

04:25.638 --> 04:26.994
I'm just going to go...

04:27.151 --> 04:28.604
Well let me know, Carol.

04:29.013 --> 04:30.850
I've got nothing to lose anymore.

04:37.322 --> 04:38.416
Thank you for meeting with us.

04:38.417 --> 04:40.461
Yeah, well, that's the beauty

04:40.462 --> 04:43.463
of the ride-share game.
I go where I want when I want.

04:43.531 --> 04:45.098
I meet tons of new people
and I get to listen

04:45.166 --> 04:47.375
to what's on their Spotify,
and I love it,

04:47.376 --> 04:49.518
and I'm really, really loving it.

04:49.738 --> 04:51.255
Cool. That's cool.

04:51.256 --> 04:52.936
- Can we talk about Myrtle?
- Yes.

04:52.937 --> 04:54.454
I'm sorry, okay, so, um...

04:55.877 --> 04:57.163
There was a mandate to write up

04:57.164 --> 04:59.612
any employee over the age of 70

04:59.681 --> 05:01.915
to give us a pretext
for firing them, okay?

05:01.916 --> 05:03.516
It didn't matter for what.

05:03.518 --> 05:06.085
I once wrote Myrtle up
for wearing gang colors,

05:06.221 --> 05:07.920
and I know she's not a Crip.

05:08.279 --> 05:09.380
Why would they do that?

05:09.382 --> 05:11.431
Old people are slower,
they have higher medical costs.

05:11.432 --> 05:12.483
I was asking Jeff.

05:13.895 --> 05:16.596
Um... that.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.517
So, what you're saying is
Myrtle is now out there

05:19.518 --> 05:20.805
collecting cans for coins

05:20.806 --> 05:22.879
because you needed
to increase the bottom line.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.138
Look, that's just the
corporate culture over there.

05:25.206 --> 05:27.106
It's the mindset. Anything is justified

05:27.175 --> 05:28.908
as long as it saves a dollar.

05:28.909 --> 05:32.582
Believe me, if there was something
I could do to change that, I would.

05:33.581 --> 05:35.505
Well, maybe there is.

05:36.251 --> 05:38.369
Hi! Are you Alejandro?

05:39.120 --> 05:40.350
No, sorry.

05:40.351 --> 05:42.036
Oh, sorry, wrong car.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.981
Alejandro has five stars.

05:47.577 --> 05:48.762
I'd love to meet him.

05:49.881 --> 05:51.424
We can't let corporate
get away with this.

05:51.425 --> 05:54.933
Yeah, if Myrtle can be fired just
because of her age then who's next?

05:55.148 --> 05:55.900
Probably Dale.

05:55.901 --> 05:57.140
I think Henry's older, actually.

05:57.141 --> 05:59.024
It goes Henry, Dale, Brett, Todd.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.685
Dude, Todd's like 40.

06:00.753 --> 06:02.153
Really? He looks bad for 40.

06:02.222 --> 06:03.488
Have you seen his wife though?

06:03.556 --> 06:04.789
Oh, she is so beautiful.

06:04.858 --> 06:06.324
Okay, guys, can we bring it back?

06:06.392 --> 06:07.525
She's Nordic.

06:07.594 --> 06:09.327
- Mm.
- Look, there is a plan.

06:09.395 --> 06:11.933
It just means we all
have to work together.

06:12.966 --> 06:14.398
- Right, exactly.
- Mm-hmm. Yep.

06:14.467 --> 06:15.833
So, you know how they're
going to live-stream

06:15.885 --> 06:18.202
the town hall meeting
to the entire company?

06:18.271 --> 06:21.806
Okay, so we're going to sneak
Jeff into that meeting.

06:22.170 --> 06:25.228
And then, he's going to
stand up in front of the CEO,

06:25.228 --> 06:26.177
and the cameras,

06:26.246 --> 06:28.145
and say why Myrtle was really fired.

06:28.214 --> 06:30.582
Wait, you're asking us
to sign on for a plan

06:30.582 --> 06:31.948
where Jeff is the key?

06:32.233 --> 06:34.214
I mean, if it was any guy
named Jeff I'd be skeptical,

06:34.215 --> 06:35.613
but he's not even one of the top Jeffs.

06:35.614 --> 06:37.355
I'm right here, guys. I'm on the phone.

06:37.423 --> 06:38.756
I stand by what I said.

06:38.825 --> 06:40.324
Couldn't they just say Jeff is lying?

06:40.393 --> 06:42.560
Yes, except that an e-mail went around

06:42.645 --> 06:44.512
listing all the employees over 70

06:44.597 --> 06:46.731
and how much money the company
would save if they were fired.

06:46.799 --> 06:48.599
I don't have access to
the corporate server anymore,

06:48.668 --> 06:49.800
but Laurie would on her phone.

06:49.869 --> 06:51.103
Bam, there's our proof.

06:51.104 --> 06:52.803
And how are you going to get her e-mail?

06:53.051 --> 06:56.212
That is the part that we
have not figured out.

06:56.213 --> 06:58.042
Okay, well, then I assume
you've figured out

06:58.111 --> 06:59.443
how to get Jeff past security

06:59.512 --> 07:02.246
or what to do if Laurie
or Neil recognize him.

07:02.593 --> 07:04.775
Or how you're going to handle
them turning off the cameras

07:04.776 --> 07:05.949
once Jeff starts speaking.

07:06.473 --> 07:09.770
So those are the other parts
that we also haven't figured out yet.

07:09.856 --> 07:11.088
Mm, solid plan.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.943
I have to ask, is this the
best day to make waves?

07:13.944 --> 07:16.627
Because I have to speak in front
of everyone on the planet.

07:16.696 --> 07:18.529
Yeah, and do we even want Myrtle back?

07:18.766 --> 07:20.364
I mean, she kind of sucked.

07:20.724 --> 07:22.567
Did someone say my name?

07:22.635 --> 07:25.336
Could you just tell us ahead
of time who all's on the phone?

07:30.977 --> 07:32.209
So are you sure being stuffed

07:32.278 --> 07:33.863
in a box in Styrofoam is safe?

07:33.949 --> 07:36.047
Yeah, it's totally safe.
They've done studies.

07:36.115 --> 07:37.728
What kind of studies?

07:39.986 --> 07:42.496
Okay, I'm going to chat up
the security guard to distract him

07:42.497 --> 07:44.188
while you drive
the forklift into the store.

07:44.257 --> 07:46.372
Um, I don't know how
to drive a forklift.

07:46.982 --> 07:49.226
Maybe you could do it
and I could talk to the guard?

07:49.550 --> 07:50.561
You have zero charisma.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.386
How are you possibly
going to chat up a guard?

07:52.534 --> 07:55.333
I'm a little worried I might
run out of oxygen in here.

07:55.401 --> 07:56.150
On it.

07:57.370 --> 07:59.437
Hey! No! Wait! Ahh!

07:59.505 --> 08:01.188
There's your air holes, princess.

08:01.662 --> 08:02.701
Thank you.

08:04.677 --> 08:05.625
Hey, Laurie.

08:06.179 --> 08:08.846
Um, I made up this seating chart

08:08.915 --> 08:10.514
for the meeting today.

08:10.583 --> 08:12.682
I was going to do it in height order

08:12.745 --> 08:14.619
but then it got really
female heavy in...

08:14.687 --> 08:17.438
None of this matters.
I don't care where people sit.

08:18.044 --> 08:20.342
Okay wait, I have
another question for you.

08:21.062 --> 08:21.797
Ah...

08:22.678 --> 08:23.941
Are you a lesbian?

08:26.566 --> 08:28.699
People always ask,
how do I get enough protein?

08:28.768 --> 08:31.410
Well, I got two words for
you, beans and nuts.

08:31.965 --> 08:32.951
I always tell people

08:32.952 --> 08:34.755
I'm nuts about beans
and I'm beans about nuts.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.442
I mean that second half

08:36.443 --> 08:38.393
doesn't mean anything, but
it sounds like something.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.190
It's more of a rhythm thing, you know?

08:40.236 --> 08:43.152
Just 'cause you were
golfing with another woman.

08:43.153 --> 08:46.383
I mean, not that two women
can't go golfing together.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.219
It just sort of felt like
there was a little bit

08:48.287 --> 08:51.324
of a thing going on
between the two of you.

08:51.913 --> 08:55.159
Anyway, if you're single,
my veterinarian

08:55.228 --> 08:57.828
just broke up with her girlfriend

08:57.897 --> 09:00.668
and, um, you know...

09:01.367 --> 09:02.296
there is that.

09:03.169 --> 09:05.536
You can put cashew cheese
on pretty much anything.

09:05.536 --> 09:07.408
And, I mean, truthfully, right now,

09:07.658 --> 09:10.717
we are in a nut cheese
renaissance, which is amazing.

09:10.718 --> 09:13.377
There's so many different
options, it's just like...

09:13.379 --> 09:15.600
She's really pretty.
I mean, at least I think so.

09:15.601 --> 09:17.178
I don't really know what your type is.

09:17.247 --> 09:18.980
But we haven't really quite established

09:19.049 --> 09:20.870
whether or not you are a lesbian,

09:21.214 --> 09:23.051
'cause you're just staring at me.

09:23.103 --> 09:24.753
This is a conversation.

09:24.821 --> 09:26.922
You can jump right in. The water's warm.

09:26.990 --> 09:28.523
You know what,
this is none of my business.

09:28.592 --> 09:29.891
Yeah, not really.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.793
You know what, my daughter's principal

09:31.828 --> 09:33.762
just came out, so that's another option.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.196
Just, back of mind.

09:35.265 --> 09:36.865
I mean, they can make milk out of

09:36.934 --> 09:39.100
cashews, almonds, soy.

09:39.136 --> 09:42.003
Then the grains, rice milk, quinoa milk.

09:42.072 --> 09:44.039
I mean how do you
get milk out of quinoa?

09:44.107 --> 09:46.875
I have no idea about
the process, but it exists.

09:46.944 --> 09:49.678
Ooh, we should disguise
Jeff as Lana Del Rey.

09:49.746 --> 09:51.313
He already has long eyelashes.

09:51.381 --> 09:54.049
Ooh, that is true, but
they still might recognize him.

09:54.117 --> 09:55.817
- You think?
- Check it out.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.452
I got this camera
patched into their feed

09:57.521 --> 10:00.021
so if they stop filming
when Jeff starts talking,

10:00.090 --> 10:02.490
this little bad boy keeps going.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.626
Oh, I know, we could give him a wig.

10:04.695 --> 10:07.362
Yes! Chey, you are such a genius.

10:07.431 --> 10:09.864
Oh, stop it, you are the genius.

10:09.933 --> 10:11.171
- You are.
- No.

10:11.172 --> 10:13.322
You know what, it actually
was really tough to do.

10:13.323 --> 10:16.171
I had to figure out
how to set up a router

10:16.256 --> 10:17.739
to transmit into their signal.

10:17.808 --> 10:20.041
Did someone ask you to do that?

10:20.317 --> 10:22.644
I'm just trying to be part of the plan.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.048
Aww...

10:25.234 --> 10:27.796
Feels weird to just be scrolling
through someone's e-mails.

10:27.797 --> 10:30.035
Can't you just search some keywords?

10:30.120 --> 10:30.986
Like what?

10:31.095 --> 10:33.021
I don't know, ageism, discrimination.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.070
Oh, right, "Hey team, how's the
ageism" discrimination going?"

10:36.071 --> 10:37.125
That's a good point.

10:37.453 --> 10:40.895
Oh, Jane Austen Superfan
Convention Pics?

10:40.964 --> 10:42.464
That's probably not it.

10:42.532 --> 10:45.667
But, we should probably
open it just to be safe.

10:45.736 --> 10:47.516
Yeah, let's not take any chances.

10:48.905 --> 10:50.238
Thanks.

10:50.307 --> 10:52.707
Hey, so this is Glenn,
the general manager.

10:52.707 --> 10:54.309
Glenn, I've heard a lot about you.

10:54.378 --> 10:56.444
You have? What did you hear?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.413
It's just that there's another Glenn

10:58.482 --> 11:00.847
that works here and people mix us up.

11:00.848 --> 11:01.384
Oh.

11:01.385 --> 11:03.663
Glenn is nice, though. He's black.

11:04.454 --> 11:06.721
Not... not "he's nice,
though he's black."

11:06.790 --> 11:09.001
Just he's very nice and very black.

11:09.459 --> 11:12.494
Maybe it would help if I did
an impression of him for you.

11:12.562 --> 11:14.662
Yo, yo, Glenn, my man, can I get five...

11:14.731 --> 11:16.898
That's not necessary.

11:16.933 --> 11:18.425
We're good. Thank you.

11:19.870 --> 11:22.154
- He knows his people.
- He's great.

11:22.539 --> 11:25.048
Not to be critical, Cheyenne,
but I feel stupid.

11:25.338 --> 11:27.720
I think you look like
a hot, skinny Hagrid.

11:27.878 --> 11:28.615
Ooh...

11:29.479 --> 11:30.701
That I can work with.

11:30.981 --> 11:33.098
Harry, 'ello Harry.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.359
Get me some eye of newt, Harry!

11:35.719 --> 11:37.152
Good, right?

11:37.220 --> 11:39.134
Hey, okay, they haven't
found the e-mail yet.

11:39.213 --> 11:40.455
- What?
- Don't worry.

11:40.490 --> 11:41.956
They're going to get it
to you during the meeting.

11:42.025 --> 11:43.091
Don't freak out.
You're going to be fine.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.747
You look incredibly stupid.

11:46.411 --> 11:47.079
Thank you.

11:51.153 --> 11:52.620
As you all know,

11:52.622 --> 11:55.289
a year ago this store
was hit by a tornado.

11:55.806 --> 11:56.865
But they rebuilt.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.391
And the man leading that rebuilding

11:59.688 --> 12:02.411
is a man who represents
the best of Cloud 9,

12:02.677 --> 12:03.877
Glenn Sturgis!

12:07.382 --> 12:09.293
Here you go, Glenn.

12:10.252 --> 12:11.904
Thank you, Neil.

12:12.754 --> 12:15.922
You know, I love this store.

12:15.991 --> 12:18.073
Cloud 9 is more than just...

12:32.641 --> 12:34.560
I'm sure it's hard to find the words.

12:35.577 --> 12:37.020
But let me just say
on behalf of all of us...

12:37.021 --> 12:37.954
That wasn't me.

12:39.047 --> 12:40.728
I know. No, it's fine.

12:41.483 --> 12:42.549
It was him.

12:42.617 --> 12:46.073
So if you're laughing, you
are laughing at our CEO.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.567
I'm... I'm sorry, Neil, go on.

12:48.568 --> 12:49.710
Um, okay.

12:50.363 --> 12:53.159
Okay, and, um, just for
the record it wasn't...

12:53.228 --> 12:55.094
you know what, doesn't matter.

12:55.163 --> 12:56.400
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.899
You had a human moment.

12:57.900 --> 12:59.897
Could have happened to anyone.
This time it was you.

12:59.898 --> 13:01.267
I'm not the one who farted.

13:01.269 --> 13:02.902
Then how do you know what happened?

13:02.904 --> 13:04.020
For someone who's so innocent,

13:04.035 --> 13:06.480
you sure seem to have
a lot of information.

13:06.482 --> 13:08.325
- You're the one who farted.
- You farted.

13:08.326 --> 13:09.743
- No, you...
- You farted!

13:12.547 --> 13:13.790
Thank you, Glenn.

13:19.821 --> 13:21.921
- He farted.
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

13:21.990 --> 13:24.216
Right on me, and then
I dragged it over here.

13:24.224 --> 13:25.529
Did you find anything yet?

13:25.530 --> 13:28.328
Well, she Postmated
three times last night.

13:28.396 --> 13:29.696
Whoa. What's the story there?

13:29.764 --> 13:32.460
- We don't have a lot of time.
- Oh, right.

13:32.461 --> 13:36.051
Oh, okay, minimizing costs
by downsizing legacy employees.

13:36.052 --> 13:38.035
Yeah, that. Pr... that. Print that.

13:38.036 --> 13:40.840
On it. Print.

13:40.909 --> 13:43.309
Wait, she Postmated ramen this morning?

13:43.378 --> 13:44.822
Ugh, what's going on with her?

13:44.823 --> 13:47.881
Hi, I am interested in
your decision-making process

13:47.949 --> 13:49.013
for new products.

13:49.014 --> 13:51.117
Ah, great question. We like to pay...

13:51.186 --> 13:52.407
Let's just say I'm an entrepreneur,

13:52.408 --> 13:53.720
which I am.

13:53.788 --> 13:55.452
I am the founder and CEO

13:55.453 --> 13:57.590
of Boob Cheese, cheese from humans.

13:57.626 --> 13:58.925
Now, breast milk is...

13:58.994 --> 14:00.226
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

14:00.295 --> 14:01.457
To the meeting.

14:01.458 --> 14:03.897
No, it's already started.
I can't let anyone through.

14:04.163 --> 14:06.122
This is obviously going
to be a game-changer.

14:06.123 --> 14:08.297
Lots of stores that this
would be a great fit for,

14:08.298 --> 14:12.848
such as, for example,
Target, Wal-Mart, Costco.

14:12.849 --> 14:14.729
No, but... but we'll be so quiet,

14:14.730 --> 14:16.876
and... and we've really been
looking forward to this.

14:16.945 --> 14:18.885
Besides, I think there are
some seats in the back.

14:18.886 --> 14:20.980
Well, you'd have to walk
past the cameras

14:21.016 --> 14:22.815
to get there, so if you can figure out

14:22.884 --> 14:25.265
a way to like teleport there,

14:25.266 --> 14:27.654
or tunnel underneath, be my guest.

14:27.722 --> 14:29.389
I'm sorry, are you asking me

14:29.457 --> 14:32.525
to carry human cheese in our stores?

14:32.594 --> 14:36.362
Oh! I hadn't really...

14:36.414 --> 14:37.651
This is unexpected.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.255
Yes! Yes! Why not? Let's do it!

14:40.256 --> 14:42.402
Laurie, I promise nobody will notice us.

14:42.470 --> 14:43.603
No... no... no, Jonah, it's okay.

14:43.672 --> 14:45.137
We're fine. We're cool.

14:45.538 --> 14:46.440
We cool?

14:50.526 --> 14:52.178
The tunnel.

14:52.247 --> 14:54.314
The tunnel.

14:55.035 --> 14:57.193
Well, I think if you buy three packs

14:57.194 --> 14:59.884
of hot dogs and four packs of buns,

15:00.067 --> 15:01.955
you should have the right amount.

15:01.957 --> 15:03.690
All right, thank you. Well, you know,

15:03.758 --> 15:06.384
I can't think of a better way
to end than that.

15:06.571 --> 15:08.127
So I want to thank you for...

15:08.196 --> 15:09.934
No, wait, I have a question!

15:09.935 --> 15:11.256
Uh... oh.

15:11.833 --> 15:15.112
I guess we have time for one more.

15:15.811 --> 15:16.428
Oh.

15:16.944 --> 15:18.679
One last question, huh?

15:18.680 --> 15:20.021
Guess I better make it a good one then.

15:21.875 --> 15:22.406
Ah...

15:23.429 --> 15:24.145
How...

15:25.154 --> 15:25.779
do...

15:26.209 --> 15:28.348
Oh, [bleep], Garrett
says they're wrapping up.

15:28.416 --> 15:30.350
- We got to go.
- Oh.

15:30.418 --> 15:32.380
I was born right here

15:32.381 --> 15:33.522
in St. Louis,

15:33.523 --> 15:35.555
and as you might know,

15:35.624 --> 15:38.580
St. Louis was originally
established as a hub

15:39.160 --> 15:40.860
for river-based trade.

15:40.929 --> 15:41.828
What are you doing?

15:41.829 --> 15:43.662
I'm just telling Garrett we're hurrying.

15:43.663 --> 15:46.074
Well, don't text it.
Just do the hurrying.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.503
♪ Oh Danny ♪

15:50.572 --> 15:54.878
♪ Boy I love you ♪

15:55.905 --> 15:58.339
♪ So ♪

15:58.713 --> 16:01.546
And that was my great-great grandfather.

16:02.384 --> 16:03.715
He's not relevant to this.

16:03.716 --> 16:06.953
Ugh, I touched rat droppings.
I need to wash my hands.

16:07.022 --> 16:08.867
There's no time!
Just don't touch your face.

16:08.868 --> 16:11.634
No! Now that's all I want to do.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.113
So, I'm 18,

16:13.628 --> 16:16.793
and I've woken up in
Wahaca, covered in furs.

16:18.700 --> 16:20.292
You know what? Never mind.

16:20.292 --> 16:21.630
My question was about self-checkouts,

16:21.631 --> 16:23.528
and I just remembered you
already answered it earlier.

16:23.529 --> 16:25.772
So I'm going to yield my time.
Thank you.

16:27.609 --> 16:29.587
Well, this has been great.

16:29.878 --> 16:30.855
I want to thank you all...

16:30.855 --> 16:31.559
Hold on!

16:32.296 --> 16:33.880
I've got a question.

16:33.948 --> 16:36.082
Look, I'm really glad

16:36.134 --> 16:37.869
to see all this excitement
from our employees...

16:37.870 --> 16:39.691
No, I'm not an employee.

16:40.061 --> 16:40.866
It's me!

16:44.453 --> 16:45.465
Jeff Sutton!

16:47.158 --> 16:48.692
Oh, right, I forgot for a second.

16:52.137 --> 16:53.421
I'm sorry, I don't...

16:53.960 --> 16:55.091
Jeff Sutton.

16:56.305 --> 16:58.593
I was the district
manager before Laurie.

16:58.909 --> 17:00.595
I worked with you for 12 years.

17:00.751 --> 17:02.363
At the counter, I got your latte

17:02.365 --> 17:04.006
that time and you got my tea.

17:04.296 --> 17:04.848
Hmm.

17:05.343 --> 17:06.267
You know what? It doesn't matter.

17:06.269 --> 17:07.082
It's not about me.

17:07.083 --> 17:09.237
It's about another former employee

17:09.239 --> 17:10.570
named Myrtle Vartanian.

17:10.573 --> 17:11.771
Okay, you know what?

17:11.773 --> 17:13.074
I think we're really out of time here.

17:13.076 --> 17:14.942
Who's Myrtle Vartanian?

17:14.944 --> 17:16.577
Myrtle is one of our more

17:16.579 --> 17:20.364
experienced employees
who was unfortunately let go

17:20.366 --> 17:21.915
due to performance issues.

17:21.917 --> 17:24.097
Except it wasn't because
of performance issues.

17:24.098 --> 17:25.670
Oh! Jeff Sutton!

17:26.221 --> 17:27.622
Well, of course I remember you.

17:28.025 --> 17:29.388
Always drinking tea.

17:29.552 --> 17:31.376
Yes! Jeff Sutton, that's me.

17:31.658 --> 17:33.074
What is this? What's happening?

17:33.076 --> 17:33.970
It's not good.

17:33.972 --> 17:35.205
Myrtle.

17:35.375 --> 17:38.449
Yeah! Myrtle was
an employee here, and...

17:38.450 --> 17:40.748
You know what?
If I could ever persuade you

17:40.750 --> 17:42.218
to come back to Cloud 9,

17:42.919 --> 17:45.712
we could definitely use a
guy like you in Chicago.

17:46.923 --> 17:47.943
Chicago?

17:48.565 --> 17:50.148
Hmm. Wow.

17:50.330 --> 17:53.199
- No, Jeff, no, no, no, no.
- Yep.

17:53.364 --> 17:54.889
Anyway, you know what, I'm sorry.

17:54.890 --> 17:56.181
I interrupted you, didn't I?

17:56.182 --> 17:58.284
What were you saying about Myrtle?

18:03.606 --> 18:04.822
Myrtle was a gang member,

18:05.038 --> 18:07.330
and that's the reason
we had to let her go.

18:08.361 --> 18:10.216
That's why you never trust a Jeff.

18:13.295 --> 18:14.665
What a weasel!

18:14.667 --> 18:16.047
Jeff or Neil?

18:16.048 --> 18:17.842
Jeff! And Neil!

18:17.843 --> 18:19.030
And Laurie, too.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.065
Just a whole company of weasels.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.111
Yeah.

18:22.759 --> 18:24.354
And you know what the worst part is?

18:24.355 --> 18:25.082
Myrtle?

18:25.715 --> 18:27.545
Yeah, of course, Myrtle.

18:27.547 --> 18:29.463
You know what the second worst part is?

18:29.465 --> 18:30.214
Huh?

18:30.216 --> 18:31.893
That I was stupid enough to think

18:31.894 --> 18:34.301
something might actually
work out in this store.

18:34.842 --> 18:36.853
I always kind of feel like

18:36.938 --> 18:38.154
things are going to work out.

18:38.219 --> 18:39.544
Yeah, you do, don't you?

18:39.999 --> 18:41.859
What's wrong with you?

18:41.861 --> 18:44.316
Hey! There's my team.

18:44.317 --> 18:45.646
Oh, nice suit.

18:45.935 --> 18:47.815
Is that from our Benedict
Arnold Collection?

18:47.817 --> 18:50.651
Look, I know how
this promotion might look,

18:50.653 --> 18:52.069
but believe me when I tell you

18:52.071 --> 18:53.309
this is a good thing for all of us.

18:53.310 --> 18:55.023
How is you selling out good for us?

18:55.024 --> 18:57.928
Because now you have a man
on the inside, at the top.

18:58.461 --> 19:00.745
The inside top,
that's where you want to be.

19:00.747 --> 19:03.298
So, now you're going to use your power

19:03.299 --> 19:05.382
to help Myrtle get her job back?

19:05.384 --> 19:07.134
Exactly. Probably.

19:07.136 --> 19:09.067
I mean, we don't want to rock
the boat too much at first.

19:09.068 --> 19:11.325
Guys, we're playing the long game here.

19:14.761 --> 19:17.301
I will see you at home. Great job today!

19:19.766 --> 19:20.745
Chill.

19:23.519 --> 19:24.900
I hope he enjoys his

19:25.307 --> 19:28.022
job with CEO Neil Farterson.

19:28.024 --> 19:30.084
'Cause he farted.

19:30.923 --> 19:32.319
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

19:34.431 --> 19:34.992
Hey.

19:36.916 --> 19:38.699
So are we okay?

19:40.169 --> 19:40.885
Look...

19:41.569 --> 19:45.235
Uh, why don't we just start over?

19:46.747 --> 19:47.925
Fresh start?

19:48.184 --> 19:49.165
Fresh start.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.663
All right, so...

20:34.257 --> 20:36.640
Oh, my God.
How many buttons do you have?

20:36.642 --> 20:37.725
A lot.

20:57.046 --> 20:59.597
Wait, do I need a...

20:59.599 --> 21:00.691
No, I'm already pregnant.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.016
Oh, right, that's awesome.

21:02.018 --> 21:03.517
- Yeah!
- Great.

21:20.419 --> 21:22.703
Hey guys, look what's on.
