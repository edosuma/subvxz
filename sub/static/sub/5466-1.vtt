02:12.298 --> 02:14.357
You ever record before?

02:14.733 --> 02:18.726
You just set yourself in front of that
microphone and play your heart out.

02:19.004 --> 02:21.472
We'll take care of the rest.
We got all the machines.

02:21.639 --> 02:24.369
You just get yourself ready
to play, okay, Robert?

02:24.542 --> 02:25.804
Good.

02:25.976 --> 02:28.069
Okay, let's get to it.

02:45.726 --> 02:48.490
Robert Johnson. Stand by.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.691
Rolling.

04:55.602 --> 04:59.698
<i>Attention, Officer McGuire. Please
report to the east wing security gate.</i>

04:59.873 --> 05:04.537
<i>Attention, Officer McGuire. Please
report to the east wing security gate.</i>

05:10.582 --> 05:12.641
Hi. I'm here to see a patient,
Willie Brown.

05:12.817 --> 05:15.809
- What is your name, please?
- Eugene Martone.

05:20.056 --> 05:24.459
Excuse me. While I'm here,
I'd like to run a routine security check.

05:25.193 --> 05:28.993
<i>Exercise classes with the physical
therapist will begin at 9 a. m...</i>

05:29.531 --> 05:31.158
<i>...Monday through Friday.</i>

05:31.332 --> 05:36.133
<i>Those patients with doctors' blue
cards are asked to participate.</i>

05:36.303 --> 05:40.501
<i>Security Officer Larkin, please pick up
the staff phone at the nurses' station.</i>

05:40.672 --> 05:44.438
<i>Security Officer Larkin, please pick up
the staff phone at the nurses' station.</i>

05:44.611 --> 05:47.273
I'm sorry, Willie says he doesn't
know anyone named Martone.

05:48.013 --> 05:50.413
Well, he doesn't know me,
but if I could talk to him...

05:50.582 --> 05:53.415
Mr. Brown made it very clear
he won't be seeing anyone.

05:53.584 --> 05:55.518
No, look, just a minute.
I have to ask him...

05:55.687 --> 06:00.818
I said, Mr. Brown made it very clear
he doesn't want to see anyone.

06:01.857 --> 06:03.950
I can't b...

06:04.693 --> 06:06.422
Shit.

06:21.841 --> 06:23.638
Just need a signature right there.

06:23.809 --> 06:28.246
<i>Attention, Officer MacFarland.
Please report to the security office.</i>

06:28.413 --> 06:30.142
<i>Attention, Officer MacFarland...</i>

06:45.128 --> 06:46.618
Martone, right?

06:46.796 --> 06:49.230
When you finish the hall,
take care of the coffee room.

06:49.397 --> 06:53.595
And let's put a clean trash bag
in my office. Thank you.

06:54.935 --> 06:57.529
They said it was me,
but I didn't do it.

06:58.539 --> 07:00.598
What's the story on Hoss?

07:00.774 --> 07:03.641
Twenty-five milligrams of
memprogromade and he's due now.

07:03.810 --> 07:05.801
Okay, fine.

07:08.446 --> 07:14.351
<i>Gary's play all the way and he
made it, just nipping McGee.</i>

07:14.519 --> 07:17.079
<i>Tim McCarver along with Steve
Zabriskie and Ralph Kiner...</i>

07:17.254 --> 07:19.484
<i>...and we've got a dandy
here at Shea.</i>

07:19.655 --> 07:23.250
<i>Well, regardless of whether
you're a Cardinals fan, a Mets fan...</i>

07:23.427 --> 07:28.228
<i>...you've gotta love this.
This is a baseball game.</i>

07:28.997 --> 07:31.124
<i>A line drive, deep.</i>

07:31.299 --> 07:34.097
<i>Can't get to it.</i>

07:34.269 --> 07:36.032
<i>Gets by him and Danny...</i>

07:50.615 --> 07:53.345
What you want, Mr. Janitor Man?
I ain't made no mess.

07:53.517 --> 07:55.951
- Hey, you're Willie.
- That's my name.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.611
I heard you playing harp,
so I dropped by to say hello.

07:58.788 --> 08:01.757
- You're new here, ain't you?
- This is my first day.

08:01.925 --> 08:05.554
Well, hello, Mr. Janitor Man.
Now let me be.

08:05.729 --> 08:06.957
I wanted you to know...

08:07.129 --> 08:10.621
...if there's anything I can get for you,
anything you want or anything...

08:10.799 --> 08:12.266
You can get gone.

08:12.801 --> 08:16.760
Sorry to bother you.
I'll just stop back later, okay?

08:16.937 --> 08:18.268
Mr. Fulton.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.439
Mr. who?

08:20.607 --> 08:24.008
You were Blind Dog Fulton
from 1939 to 1968, weren't you?

08:24.478 --> 08:26.446
What you been drinking, Sterno?

08:26.612 --> 08:29.604
Your name's Willie Brown. Blind Dog
Fulton was born Willie Brown.

08:29.782 --> 08:32.114
He used that name up until 1938.

08:32.283 --> 08:34.274
After his friend Robert Johnson
was killed...

08:34.452 --> 08:37.250
...he headed up to Chicago,
changed it to Blind Dog Fulton.

08:37.490 --> 08:40.583
I got six cousins named Willie Brown.

08:40.759 --> 08:43.956
Man working that grocery store down
the street, his name Willie Brown.

08:44.126 --> 08:46.322
If I had a nickel for every
Willie Brown...

08:46.497 --> 08:48.988
...I wouldn't be here now,
listening to your bullshit.

08:49.165 --> 08:51.531
You're not the Willie Brown
Robert calls out to...

08:51.701 --> 08:52.929
...in "Crossroad Blues"?

08:53.102 --> 08:55.593
Shit, no. Robert Johnson.

08:56.170 --> 08:59.139
You play harmonica. That's the real
Willie Brown's main instrument.

08:59.307 --> 09:00.604
It doesn't make sense.

09:00.775 --> 09:03.300
Where I come from,
you don't blow no harp...

09:03.477 --> 09:05.274
...you don't get no pussy.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.685
There's no way. You gotta be. It's...

10:02.192 --> 10:05.355
All right, Miss Narciso, please.

10:06.197 --> 10:08.131
That was very good, Eugene.

10:08.298 --> 10:10.926
Very good up to a point.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.092
Most people approach
Mozart with respect.

10:14.269 --> 10:17.170
Evidently that's an attitude
you're not familiar with.

10:17.339 --> 10:19.364
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean any disrespect.

10:19.540 --> 10:23.101
I was just making a joke.

10:31.116 --> 10:34.381
<i>Which one of these is a cigar lighter?
Have a little...</i>

10:34.553 --> 10:36.748
<i>Blasted new-fangled gadgets.</i>

10:37.087 --> 10:38.748
<i>Never work.</i>

10:41.726 --> 10:44.217
<i>Gramshell's folly.</i>

10:44.829 --> 10:46.490
<i>Pile of junk.</i>

10:46.664 --> 10:48.962
<i>Oh, what a mess.</i>

10:49.131 --> 10:52.191
<i>Magoo. Hello, Magoo.</i>

10:52.669 --> 10:54.068
<i>Magoo, can you hear me?</i>

10:54.237 --> 10:58.401
Well, well, well. Mr. Janitor Man.

10:58.673 --> 11:04.976
Hey, why a white boy like you so hot
on some long-gone harmonica player?

11:05.145 --> 11:07.477
I'm looking for a lost song.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.313
Lost song?
What tune you looking for?

11:10.483 --> 11:13.850
Robert Johnson was supposed to
record 30 songs at his Texas sessions.

11:14.021 --> 11:17.115
Only 29 exist. He never
recorded number 30.

11:17.289 --> 11:19.314
- You read that in a book too?
- That's right.

11:19.491 --> 11:22.324
I figure you might be the last man
alive to know where it is.

11:22.493 --> 11:24.654
That part's not in the book.

11:25.529 --> 11:27.997
Why you wanna know
about all that kind of stuff?

11:29.667 --> 11:30.895
I'm a bluesman.

11:31.067 --> 11:34.230
A bluesman.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.301
You? Where you from?

11:36.673 --> 11:38.231
I was born on Long Island, why?

11:38.606 --> 11:41.700
Long Island. Oh, shit, this is rich.

11:41.877 --> 11:47.076
Long Island, the famous breeding
ground for bluesmen.

11:47.781 --> 11:49.009
Oh, man.

11:49.183 --> 11:53.210
Okay, Willie, time for your weekly with
the doctor. Let's go have a checkup.

11:57.590 --> 12:00.923
Hey. You gonna be a janitor,
act like one.

12:01.092 --> 12:03.890
Mop my room, you hear?
Give her a good straightening.

12:04.063 --> 12:07.123
Come on, Willie.
Stop being such a pain.

12:08.264 --> 12:11.427
Long Island bluesman.

12:20.776 --> 12:23.745
<i>You came to us
as a classical student.</i>

12:23.911 --> 12:27.312
<i>The word "prodigy" was actually
used on occasion.</i>

12:27.882 --> 12:32.114
And you have proven to be one of
the finest guitarists in the school.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.287
Mr. Martone, a word of advice:

12:36.488 --> 12:39.480
Don't serve two masters.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.622
The discipline of the classical
is very exacting.

12:43.795 --> 12:47.663
And if you persist in the other,
you will squander your talent.

12:47.832 --> 12:49.891
What if the other is my talent?

12:50.435 --> 12:54.701
Excellence in primitive music
is cultural.

12:54.872 --> 12:56.897
You have to be born to it.

12:57.940 --> 13:00.738
Now, you were allowed to leave
secondary school early...

13:00.910 --> 13:03.640
...to pursue classical studies.

13:03.945 --> 13:08.041
I suggest you reexamine
your priorities.

14:34.487 --> 14:36.682
Well, looky here.

14:36.856 --> 14:41.589
The famous Long Island bluesman
come back to pay another visit.

14:41.761 --> 14:43.456
How's it going, Willie?

14:43.629 --> 14:46.996
- You ever been to Mississippi?
- Nope.

14:47.633 --> 14:52.127
- You call yourself a bluesman?
- You're not Blind Dog Fulton, right?

14:54.439 --> 14:58.170
Yeah, well, Willie, I got something
here that you may be interested in.

15:19.625 --> 15:21.991
Hey, blind boy, come over here.

15:23.329 --> 15:26.423
- What's your name, four-eyes?
- My name Willie Brown, sir.

15:26.597 --> 15:29.191
What you doing on these crossroads
alone, Willie Brown?

15:29.368 --> 15:31.495
Robert Johnson told me
I could makes a deal here.

15:31.669 --> 15:34.331
A deal. With who?

15:34.506 --> 15:36.940
Robert say a man called Legba.
You him?

15:37.108 --> 15:40.077
No, no.

15:43.379 --> 15:45.313
I'm his assistant.

15:47.483 --> 15:51.544
Now, let me see here. You got to tell
me what's on your mind, Willie Brown.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.210
I got 2 dollar.

15:54.754 --> 15:55.982
Well...

15:56.158 --> 16:00.026
...your green don't buy nothing down
where Legba come from, boy.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.387
Now, you wanna play
like Robert Johnson?

16:02.561 --> 16:05.052
You wanna play like
Petie Wheatstraw?

16:05.231 --> 16:08.291
Well, say good night to your soul, son.

16:12.437 --> 16:15.133
Go on, blind boy. Sign.

16:28.918 --> 16:32.046
Be here before 12
every Saturday night...

16:32.587 --> 16:34.817
...and you learn them blues.

16:47.934 --> 16:49.925
Boy, about that 2 dollar...

16:50.102 --> 16:52.332
...I'm running a little low on gas.

16:58.442 --> 17:01.036
See you in hell, blind boy.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.484
Oh, man. Look at this shit.

17:14.656 --> 17:18.115
Here we go. A little soul
from the golden ghetto.

17:18.292 --> 17:22.161
Hey, Long Island, let's hear the one
about the plantation you was born on.

17:22.329 --> 17:26.789
Let's hear how you come
to doing time on the pea farm.

17:58.859 --> 18:02.158
You ain't gonna let me rest
with this music talk, are you?

18:02.629 --> 18:04.062
Nope.

18:04.297 --> 18:06.094
Okay.

18:06.266 --> 18:08.791
Meet Blind Dog Fulton.

18:08.968 --> 18:11.766
The original, one and only,
Willie Brown.

18:11.938 --> 18:14.270
- You have found your man.
- Oh, this is great.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.670
This is great. I knew it. You thought...

18:16.842 --> 18:19.572
- Look, I'm not Robert Johnson, but...
- No, you ain't.

18:19.744 --> 18:24.010
You ain't the beginning of a pimple on
the late, great Robert Johnson's ass.

18:24.815 --> 18:27.682
You might have lightning,
but you missing everything else.

18:27.852 --> 18:29.683
- What? Like what?
- Mileage.

18:29.852 --> 18:32.844
You can't get that living at home
with your mama wiping your butt.

18:33.022 --> 18:34.284
- I don't.
- Where you live?

18:34.457 --> 18:35.856
It's like a school dormitory.

18:36.192 --> 18:39.593
Oh, a school dormitory.

18:39.762 --> 18:43.493
Oh, times is hard.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.861
Times is hard.

18:47.601 --> 18:49.364
Willie, wait up. Wait up.

18:49.534 --> 18:52.503
You know what song it was Robert
Johnson didn't record that day?

18:52.672 --> 18:54.435
I was with Robert when he made it up.

18:54.606 --> 18:56.403
Memphis, summer, 1936.

18:56.575 --> 18:58.440
- Could you let me in on it?
- Shit, no.

18:58.609 --> 19:00.839
- Well, why not?
- Why should I?

19:01.012 --> 19:03.947
Well, see, I could record it.
Like Clapton did with "Crossroads."

19:04.114 --> 19:06.139
The Rolling Stones did it
with "Love in Vain."

19:06.316 --> 19:08.648
It could be my whole introduction
to the blues scene.

19:08.818 --> 19:10.046
We could record it together.

19:10.220 --> 19:12.552
You're just one more white boy
ripping off our music.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.746
No, no. Willie, we'd be giving
it to the whole world.

19:15.924 --> 19:18.119
See, there's people who'd give
anything for that.

19:18.293 --> 19:22.024
- I mean, me and you, we could just...
- No, you ain't deserving. No mileage.

19:22.196 --> 19:25.188
Willie, look, when I get out of Juilliard,
I'll put on some mileage...

19:25.366 --> 19:28.529
...but right now, I just...
- When you get out of Julie who?

19:28.869 --> 19:31.633
- Juilliard, it's just a music school...
- Ain't but one school...

19:31.805 --> 19:35.002
...straight on down to the Delta.
That's where it all started.

19:36.242 --> 19:40.144
Willie, here's something from the
Delta. Tell me this isn't Son House.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.414
Sounds like bird shit.

19:44.581 --> 19:47.641
Come on, Willie. We could record
the song right here in the hospital.

19:47.818 --> 19:50.685
Imagine what we could do
with that track. Just imagine what...

19:50.854 --> 19:53.414
Eugene, get me out of here.

19:53.589 --> 19:56.581
- What?
- Get me back down to Fulton's Point...

19:56.758 --> 19:59.192
...my piece of land outside Yazoo City.

19:59.361 --> 20:03.195
- Right, escape from here. I'd wind up...
- Get me out and you got that song.

20:03.365 --> 20:05.026
You serious?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.668
You're serious. What, are you
trying to get me arrested?

20:13.073 --> 20:16.304
Come on, Willie, cut the shit, now.
I'm serious about this song.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.206
The only shit to cut
around here is you.

20:19.377 --> 20:21.902
I've been of a mind that you
was another lightning boy...

20:22.080 --> 20:23.945
...but you just a chicken-ass.

20:32.789 --> 20:34.882
Chicken-ass chickenshit.

20:35.825 --> 20:37.349
You can walk?

20:37.525 --> 20:40.619
I can still do a few other things too.

20:41.731 --> 20:44.598
I may be about ready
for another woman.

20:44.766 --> 20:48.258
You know, I've been married
four times. I just wore them all out.

20:50.304 --> 20:51.532
You're not a cripple.

20:51.704 --> 20:53.899
You're always asking people
to get things for you.

20:54.073 --> 20:57.474
Yeah, well, they find out I can walk,
they take away my Pontiac.

20:57.643 --> 21:00.476
Man ain't no man he ain't got no car.

21:00.646 --> 21:03.877
- You got a car?
- No.

21:04.082 --> 21:06.448
Then you ain't no man yet.

21:06.618 --> 21:10.850
Not even close,
are you, Mr. Chicken-Ass?

21:11.020 --> 21:12.920
Come on, Willie. I'm not chicken.

21:13.089 --> 21:14.317
I'm not crazy either.

21:14.492 --> 21:17.325
You want me to get you to Mississippi
on what they pay me here?

21:17.494 --> 21:19.462
I got some money I been saving.

21:20.764 --> 21:23.255
- You're not gonna teach me the song?
- Sure I will.

21:23.433 --> 21:24.866
In the state of Mississippi.

21:25.933 --> 21:27.298
I got a train to catch, Willie.

21:27.467 --> 21:30.903
Go home to your dormitory. Let them
wipe and polish your ass real good.

21:31.071 --> 21:33.266
And be sure to call your mama
and kiss her...

21:33.439 --> 21:36.101
Why don't you just leave
my mother out of it, Willie.

21:36.276 --> 21:41.339
Look, that song Robert wrote
is a real good one.

21:41.713 --> 21:44.614
You could be the first man to record it.

21:49.387 --> 21:51.378
All right. Look.

21:51.556 --> 21:53.524
Tomorrow morning, 5:00.
You be ready.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.249
We'll go to Mississippi, all right?

21:57.061 --> 22:00.326
- You mean it?
- I told you, just be ready.

22:43.965 --> 22:46.263
All right, I'll be out
in a few minutes, okay?

22:46.435 --> 22:48.630
It's your meter, kid.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.065
Looking for me?

23:36.744 --> 23:39.611
- What are you dressed like that for?
- Because I'm a bluesman.

23:39.779 --> 23:41.576
You be quiet. Come on.

23:44.518 --> 23:47.578
Okay, let's go. Come on.

23:53.358 --> 23:55.758
- Hey!
- Shit.

23:56.328 --> 23:57.556
Come on.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.026
Where the hell you think
you're going?

24:00.830 --> 24:02.229
Shit.

24:16.976 --> 24:18.443
Come on.

24:23.315 --> 24:25.806
- Willie.
- Hey, get back here!

24:26.786 --> 24:28.777
Come back here.
Open the door, open the door!

24:36.427 --> 24:38.190
Okay, come on.

24:42.132 --> 24:43.599
Get in.

24:50.471 --> 24:52.371
Okay, come on.

24:57.511 --> 24:59.445
Willie, I checked this out last night.

24:59.613 --> 25:01.706
I only have enough cash
to get to Memphis.

25:01.882 --> 25:03.349
That's where we change buses.

25:03.517 --> 25:07.044
I want you to kick in some money to
Mississippi. Got that roll on you?

25:07.220 --> 25:09.688
Been on my hip right next
to my whip for 15 years.

25:09.855 --> 25:11.720
- Of course I got it.
- Let's have it. Come on.

25:11.890 --> 25:15.155
You don't be pulling out a wad
of bacon like that in New York City.

25:15.327 --> 25:18.262
In Memphis, I'll pick up the tickets
and pay for the rest.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.090
Okay?

25:20.265 --> 25:23.098
All right.
I'm gonna go get the tickets.

25:27.537 --> 25:29.937
- Well, half is mine.
- All right, here. You take this.

25:55.560 --> 25:59.860
I traveled with Robert off and on
between 1932 and 1938.

26:00.031 --> 26:02.864
Last time I saw him was a couple
of months before he died.

26:03.032 --> 26:06.627
I wanted to go on to Chicago, but he
wanted to go on back to Mississippi.

26:07.137 --> 26:10.595
He wanted to learn real good
blues and make a name.

26:10.773 --> 26:13.469
- So he went on down...
- I know. I read all about this, Willie.

26:13.643 --> 26:16.840
He went to the crossroads. That's
where he made his deal with the devil.

26:17.012 --> 26:19.947
- You read about it?
- They have books on blues folklore.

26:20.115 --> 26:22.845
Oh, don't give me that folklore shit.
It happened.

26:23.017 --> 26:24.746
Now, that's where Robert
made his deal...

26:24.918 --> 26:28.251
...and after he told me about it,
that's where I made mine.

26:28.422 --> 26:30.856
They learn you in school
what happened to Robert?

26:31.490 --> 26:34.755
Well, some books say he was shot.
Some say he was poisoned.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.622
One said he was poisoned,
then stabbed.

26:36.795 --> 26:39.593
- I don't think anybody really knows.
- Yeah, well, I know.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.097
And it all means just one thing: dead.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.930
Right, Willie. And you made
your deal at the crossroads.

26:47.103 --> 26:48.536
Yeah, I made a deal.

26:48.705 --> 26:51.333
I had my piece of fame and fortune.

26:51.507 --> 26:53.168
What come of me?

26:53.342 --> 26:58.041
The state pen, prison ward,
old folks' cage.

26:58.747 --> 27:00.578
You really did shoot somebody,
didn't you?

27:00.748 --> 27:04.206
I know that's why they put you in jail
and everything, but you really did it?

27:04.385 --> 27:06.012
Damn right.

27:06.186 --> 27:08.177
Snooks Jordan.

27:08.356 --> 27:10.187
Guitar man.

27:10.357 --> 27:12.222
He was doing the business.

27:12.390 --> 27:15.826
Come to find out he was taking more
than his part of the money...

27:15.995 --> 27:19.192
...telling me that's all
the man was paying.

27:19.631 --> 27:22.828
I smacked him right in his
face while he was driving.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.524
He pulled over...

27:24.703 --> 27:27.763
...took this half-pint, broke it on
the road and come back in on me.

27:27.937 --> 27:29.564
Shot him in the neck.

27:30.139 --> 27:32.107
And you didn't get out
on parole or nothing.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.766
No, I didn't have nobody
to stand for me.

27:34.943 --> 27:37.377
I didn't have no place to go.

27:37.646 --> 27:41.912
All I got was hellhounds on my trail.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.150
Well, it's not over yet, Willie Brown.

27:55.327 --> 27:56.885
Well, this is it. We're down South.

27:57.063 --> 27:59.088
How does it feel to be
in the land of cotton?

27:59.264 --> 28:00.754
Tennessee ain't bad...

28:00.933 --> 28:03.868
...but she ain't a pretty piece
like old home Mississippi.

28:04.035 --> 28:07.061
It won't be long now. This is where
we change buses, remember?

28:07.238 --> 28:10.401
Of course I remember. What do
you think, I done lost all my faculties?

28:10.575 --> 28:12.600
Give me the money.
I'll go get the tickets.

28:12.775 --> 28:14.572
I thought you was paying the freight.

28:14.744 --> 28:16.575
No. You know I paid
from New York to here.

28:16.746 --> 28:19.510
- You're taking care of the rest.
- I'm taking care of the rest?

28:19.682 --> 28:21.479
Give me the money.
We'll get the tickets.

28:21.649 --> 28:24.675
- That's gonna be a problem.
- Why is that?

28:24.853 --> 28:27.481
What do I look like, Rockefeller?
I ain't got that money.

28:27.654 --> 28:29.087
Stop joking. We don't have time.

28:29.256 --> 28:31.554
Just give me the money,
we can get out of here.

28:31.724 --> 28:34.659
The money, Willie. Come on.
Give me the money roll.

28:34.927 --> 28:36.792
Otherwise we're not getting anyplace.

28:36.963 --> 28:38.521
Thank you.

28:39.198 --> 28:42.895
Now, count it up, because I don't
know exactly how much I got.

28:49.339 --> 28:52.308
Willie, what the hell is this newspaper
shit? There's only $40 here.

28:52.475 --> 28:53.703
That's about right.

28:53.877 --> 28:56.641
- What are you trying to pull?
- $40 ain't nothing to sneeze at.

28:56.812 --> 29:01.010
Well, it's certainly not gonna get us
to Mississippi, you know that. You...

29:01.517 --> 29:05.283
Just wait here. I'll find out
what shit you got me in now.

29:06.186 --> 29:07.414
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, sir.

29:07.589 --> 29:10.558
Yeah, I need to get to Yazoo City,
Mississippi. How far is that?

29:10.724 --> 29:13.591
Yazoo City, about 200 miles.

29:13.759 --> 29:16.193
Two hundred. I got $40.
I need to get two people there.

29:16.362 --> 29:18.296
- How far will that get me?
- Two people?

29:18.464 --> 29:20.694
That ain't even gonna get
you one-third the way.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.726
That's what I thought.
Thank you.

29:24.036 --> 29:26.630
Nice going, Willie. Yazoo City
is over 200 miles from here.

29:26.804 --> 29:28.271
What are we gonna do now
with $40?

29:28.439 --> 29:30.634
Call your mama.
Put it on one of her credit cards.

29:30.809 --> 29:34.142
I told you to leave her out of it.
I'm not calling my father in Chicago.

29:34.309 --> 29:36.470
- Why's your daddy in Chicago?
- They're divorced.

29:36.646 --> 29:39.206
- It's none of your business.
- That's what they get.

29:39.381 --> 29:41.144
The hell with you.
I'm not calling them.

29:41.317 --> 29:43.046
We got $40.
We're gonna handle this now.

29:43.218 --> 29:44.708
Ain't you got pride.

29:44.886 --> 29:47.252
Ain't but one thing we can do
in that circumstance.

29:47.421 --> 29:49.389
- What? What's that?
- Hobo.

29:49.558 --> 29:52.493
- Hobo?
- Yeah, I done it for 70 years of my life.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.685
Robert Johnson done it all of his.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.022
Ain't no sense in stopping now.

29:57.197 --> 30:00.223
Welcome to Bluesville, son.

30:26.655 --> 30:28.384
Okay.

30:35.528 --> 30:38.497
What's the matter with you, Lightning?
Why are you looking so down?

30:38.664 --> 30:41.394
No problem. I like sharing the back
of a truck with chickens.

30:41.566 --> 30:43.534
It's my idea of a real good time.

30:43.703 --> 30:46.831
Well, it should be. You in Mississippi,
the home of the blues...

30:47.005 --> 30:50.634
...and standing on Highway 61.
- Wonderful.

30:50.808 --> 30:53.368
Look, you go down this road...

30:53.544 --> 30:58.948
...and you run right smack-dab
into the heart of where it all started.

31:01.050 --> 31:04.281
I can understand why you ain't happy.

31:04.452 --> 31:07.478
This is the real thing.
This ain't no book.

31:07.656 --> 31:11.353
- What are you doing?
- I'm changing my tie.

31:11.525 --> 31:14.119
And I could use a little help.

31:20.699 --> 31:22.428
I ought to choke you.

31:22.602 --> 31:26.038
You do and you get knocked
on your ass.

31:26.305 --> 31:30.742
This is a Mississippi string tie. This
is what a bluesman wear in this state.

31:30.909 --> 31:33.878
Them other ties, they for city folk.

31:35.746 --> 31:36.974
Thanks, Lightning.

31:37.147 --> 31:39.672
Get your thumb on back out
there and get us another ride.

31:39.850 --> 31:42.910
We got a long way
to go to Fulton's Point.

31:51.593 --> 31:55.222
About 40 more miles and
we make it into Greenville.

31:55.396 --> 31:58.331
Great. Greenville, Mississippi,
is where I've always wanted to be.

31:58.499 --> 32:00.228
You don't know nothing.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.698
A lot of good bluesmen
from around Greenville.

32:02.869 --> 32:05.633
A lot of fine, foxy mamas too, yes, sir.

32:05.805 --> 32:08.239
Greenville is famous for pussy.

32:08.407 --> 32:10.773
Hey, look at that train over there.

32:46.137 --> 32:49.732
You ain't gonna never get that lost
song if you can't make the train talk.

32:49.909 --> 32:53.504
Yeah, the way you playing,
it's gonna take you 10 years.

32:53.912 --> 32:55.675
Well, maybe I'll have to do
what you did.

32:55.847 --> 32:58.315
Go to the crossroads and
strike a deal with the devil.

32:58.483 --> 33:00.144
That'll take care of the whole th...

33:00.318 --> 33:02.218
Don't you ever say that again.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.431
<i>What you waiting for?</i>

33:22.603 --> 33:24.730
What you waiting for, four-eyes?

33:34.345 --> 33:36.438
Willie, what's the matter?

33:38.916 --> 33:40.281
Hey, come on, Willie. You okay?

33:41.618 --> 33:43.313
Of course I'm okay.

33:43.488 --> 33:46.082
You ain't drinking your beer.
Come on, we gotta get moving.

33:46.255 --> 33:48.815
Maybe I just wanna hang
for a minute, all right?

33:49.492 --> 33:50.754
There's a pay phone outside.

33:50.926 --> 33:53.121
Go call your mama.
She be checking up on you by now.

33:53.294 --> 33:54.784
She's in Europe, Willie.

33:54.963 --> 33:58.091
Nobody's gonna notice I'm gone,
not that it's any of your business.

33:58.265 --> 33:59.664
Kind of testy, ain't you?

33:59.833 --> 34:01.926
Well, I got no reason to be, right?

34:02.135 --> 34:04.365
I came here to learn
Robert Johnson's lost song...

34:04.538 --> 34:06.529
...not get slapped in the face
by an old man.

34:06.707 --> 34:09.072
Or find out I gotta become a hobo
and go broke...

34:09.241 --> 34:12.141
I'm sorry your life turned out
so hard, Eugene.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.505
But I got my own business
to tend to down here.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.146
And I won't have you
slow me down.

34:16.313 --> 34:18.406
- Business? What business?
- Personal business.

34:18.583 --> 34:21.416
And given your attitude,
you got no reason to know what.

34:21.585 --> 34:24.782
What the hell's the matter with
my attitude? I have a great attitude.

34:24.954 --> 34:28.583
You got your mind made up about how
everything works, don't you?

34:28.757 --> 34:30.521
How you ever gonna learn
anything new...

34:30.692 --> 34:32.717
...when you know everything already?

34:33.495 --> 34:36.362
Look at this old guitar
you been squeaking on.

34:36.531 --> 34:38.623
I bet you saw it in a store
and bought it...

34:38.800 --> 34:40.665
...just because you thought
it was beat-up.

34:40.835 --> 34:42.735
Well, you got it all wrong.

34:42.902 --> 34:45.895
Muddy Waters invented electricity.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.577
Yes, sir. Now, I can tell you're
a real musical-type young fellow.

34:54.746 --> 34:57.146
Good-looking boy too.
Know what you're talking about.

34:57.316 --> 35:01.082
Now, I got something right here...
Something right here for you.

35:01.252 --> 35:03.277
They call this here a Pignose.

35:03.455 --> 35:06.151
Now, you just hook it on your belt,
plug it right in there...

35:06.322 --> 35:07.550
...and you're amplified.

35:07.724 --> 35:10.158
- I can walk around with this amp on?
- Oh, sure thing.

35:10.327 --> 35:13.023
- I mean, you'll be a walking concert.
- Let me check this out.

35:13.195 --> 35:15.129
- You got that on?
- Yeah, go ahead.

35:22.369 --> 35:24.701
- All right.
- This is a great rig. It's great.

35:24.872 --> 35:28.273
I can go electric and portable. So
you're right. I'll be a walking concert.

35:28.441 --> 35:30.966
You ain't lacking in confidence,
I'll give you that.

35:31.145 --> 35:33.841
Now, we'll cut off a couple of inches
off this tubing here...

35:34.012 --> 35:36.810
...and make you a slide.
You wanna play some Delta blues...

35:36.982 --> 35:38.279
...you gotta use a slide.

35:38.450 --> 35:42.648
All right, now, if you can come up with
$400, you can take the whole rig.

35:50.961 --> 35:54.897
Mighty fine watch. Let's move on down
here and let's talk some business.

35:56.498 --> 35:58.762
- Look here.
- Let's see what we got here, now.

35:58.933 --> 36:02.334
Look, this watch is worth over $ 1100.

36:02.503 --> 36:05.802
His mama bought it for him,
you understand what I mean?

36:05.974 --> 36:07.635
- How long...?
- Take a look at this hat.

36:07.808 --> 36:10.572
All I need is a Mississippi
string tie, I'm ready to roll.

36:10.744 --> 36:13.440
Yeah, you need a lot more than that.

36:42.103 --> 36:43.661
Come on, Willie.

37:16.265 --> 37:18.324
Move your ass right back
out that door, sucker.

37:18.501 --> 37:20.025
Come on, get the hell out of here.

37:20.502 --> 37:23.835
So that's the way it's gonna be?
All right.

37:24.006 --> 37:28.568
Come on, missy. You won't be
the first woman to ever cut me.

37:29.043 --> 37:33.241
Let me tell you, you won't be the first
woman I ever whup her ass either.

37:33.413 --> 37:36.439
That's the way you want it? It's your
funeral. Come on, keep coming.

37:36.616 --> 37:37.844
Come on. Come on.

37:38.017 --> 37:41.316
Go ahead. Are you gonna stand there
or are you gonna carve me up?

37:41.486 --> 37:43.420
- Jump!
- Shit.

37:43.622 --> 37:46.090
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.718
Pulling a knife on an old man,
half blind...

37:48.893 --> 37:51.259
...then wanna chase him
back out in the rain.

37:52.296 --> 37:55.959
Back in my day,
hobos respected each other.

37:58.268 --> 38:00.930
- What name you go by?
- Frances.

38:01.103 --> 38:03.833
They call me Blind Dog Fulton.

38:04.005 --> 38:06.269
Also known as Willie Brown.

38:06.442 --> 38:08.171
- Also...
- What about him?

38:08.342 --> 38:10.833
Lightning Boy Martone.
Also known as Eugene.

38:11.011 --> 38:13.138
Lightning Boy and Blind Dog.

38:13.313 --> 38:15.178
What the hell are you guys
supposed to be?

38:15.349 --> 38:18.318
- We're both bluesmen.
- Well, I'm the bluesman.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.349
He's from Long Island.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.681
We're hoboing.
What about you?

38:22.855 --> 38:25.653
I'm hitching from Philadelphia,
going out to L.A.

38:25.824 --> 38:27.416
I got a dancing gig out there.

38:27.593 --> 38:31.085
Yeah, well, this road ain't no place
for a sweet-pants like you.

38:31.261 --> 38:34.697
Now, you take that from the greatest
hobo that ever lived.

38:34.998 --> 38:37.193
How old are you, anyway?
You under 16?

38:37.366 --> 38:40.335
Yeah, you're right, Willie.
I'd say she's definitely jailbait.

38:40.703 --> 38:45.299
Oh, yeah? I don't see too many signs
of puberty on you, honey.

38:45.474 --> 38:47.772
Anyway, I'm 17. How old are you?

38:47.942 --> 38:49.910
I'm 17.

38:50.278 --> 38:52.212
- What are you, a runaway?
- Yeah.

38:52.379 --> 38:53.641
Four-time vet.

38:53.814 --> 38:55.748
I think I threw them a curve,
heading south.

38:55.916 --> 39:00.580
Yeah, well, they threw us a few curves
too since Lightning broke me out.

39:00.754 --> 39:02.619
You broke him out of jail?

39:02.788 --> 39:04.153
No.

39:04.323 --> 39:06.553
Well, no, it was like a nursing home.

39:08.093 --> 39:10.994
A nursing home?
Oh, give me a break.

39:11.161 --> 39:13.789
Excuse me while I go
put my pants on.

39:19.502 --> 39:20.992
- Pack up.
- What?

39:21.170 --> 39:22.535
- Pack up.
- Why?

39:22.706 --> 39:24.469
Get your bags packed.

39:25.308 --> 39:26.935
Get your stuff together.

39:28.910 --> 39:31.435
- Which way you guys headed?
- South, towards...

39:31.613 --> 39:34.810
...Yazoo City and Vicksburg.
- Staying on 61?

39:34.982 --> 39:37.143
Damn right, that's the road home.
Come on.

39:37.318 --> 39:40.116
- What are you doing?
- Just wait. I'll tell you about it later.

39:40.287 --> 39:42.312
It's raining.

39:43.088 --> 39:46.580
Well, I got a longer hike. I'm going
down to Jackson. I'll see you around.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.751
Yeah, sure. I hope you
make it to L.A. fast.

39:55.132 --> 39:58.124
- Come on, we can't let that get away.
- What? She's bad news.

39:58.301 --> 40:00.030
That thing's got a leg on it.

40:00.203 --> 40:03.730
Now, it'll get lots more rides
than your thumb. Come on.

40:12.380 --> 40:14.507
Yeah, could you take me
as far south as you can?

40:14.682 --> 40:16.240
- Sure enough.
- Oh, great.

40:18.018 --> 40:19.246
Shit.

40:23.456 --> 40:26.948
This dude's taking us to the next town.
From there we're going separate ways.

40:27.126 --> 40:30.562
Hey, no problem. We don't want you
slowing us down anyway.

41:13.398 --> 41:15.457
What the hell is going on here?

41:15.633 --> 41:17.624
What, are y'all trying to run off
my business?

41:17.802 --> 41:20.999
Hey, hey, boy, I'm talking to you.

41:21.170 --> 41:24.662
- Hey, relax, we're going.
- You're damn right you're going.

41:24.840 --> 41:29.243
And you can tell that old mud duck
to get his ass off my property.

41:29.413 --> 41:31.813
Lay off. You got no right talking
to people like that.

41:31.980 --> 41:33.277
Where you from, boy?

41:34.115 --> 41:36.083
New York.

41:37.050 --> 41:39.018
Well, Mr. New York, I tell you what.

41:39.186 --> 41:42.519
See now, I'll go in my office
and I'll get my.357 Magnum...

41:42.688 --> 41:44.121
...and I'll bring it out here...

41:44.292 --> 41:48.058
...and then you and I can discuss
just who's got the right.

41:48.428 --> 41:50.362
Come on, let's go.

41:52.764 --> 41:54.425
Don't come back.

41:55.734 --> 41:59.170
All right, all right, folks. Come on,
it's Lloyd's turn to buy. Darling?

41:59.336 --> 42:01.566
Louise, where the hell have
you been lately?

42:01.739 --> 42:05.004
I've been looking all over
for you all week.

42:08.144 --> 42:10.578
I didn't know that
kind of thing still went on.

42:10.746 --> 42:14.273
Well, now you starting to learn
some deep blues.

42:33.799 --> 42:36.632
She's not doing what I think
she's doing, is she?

42:43.841 --> 42:45.570
Shit.

42:52.314 --> 42:55.613
She's only 17. What if that bum
does something to her?

42:55.784 --> 42:59.720
- I can't believe she's doing this.
- It's a dangerous road, Lightning.

42:59.887 --> 43:03.186
And 17 ain't no minor in this state.

43:03.824 --> 43:08.056
Why don't we just call this, oh,
an introductory offer?

43:08.228 --> 43:10.355
You know, on the house.
And in return...

43:10.530 --> 43:14.022
...to show you what a nice fellow
I really am...

43:14.198 --> 43:19.795
...why, I'm gonna let you push ass
out of this room all night long.

43:20.872 --> 43:23.363
Didn't look to me like she
was going against her will.

43:23.541 --> 43:27.033
Looked to me like she thought
she knew what she was doing.

43:32.582 --> 43:34.641
Hell, I got girls coming
up from Jackson...

43:34.816 --> 43:36.681
...work out of here on weekends.

43:36.851 --> 43:39.911
Now, I keep a real orderly shop.

43:40.088 --> 43:42.454
Nobody gets in trouble.

43:42.622 --> 43:45.489
Matter of fact, a girl as young...

43:45.660 --> 43:47.252
...and pretty as you are...

43:47.426 --> 43:52.125
...well, I bet she'd be real
popular around here.

44:02.773 --> 44:04.741
We probably got a deal, huh?

44:06.644 --> 44:10.239
I mean, I always liked showering
with a healthy, young girl.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.685
Why don't you go start the shower,
okay. I like it nice and hot.

44:15.851 --> 44:18.046
- You want it hot?
- Yeah.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.085
You're gonna get it.

44:20.255 --> 44:22.689
You're gonna get it steaming, baby.

44:22.958 --> 44:25.392
Now, you get those clothes off,
you hear?

44:35.435 --> 44:37.232
- What are you doing here?
- Are you crazy?

44:37.402 --> 44:39.461
Come on, let's get you out of here.
Come on.

44:39.637 --> 44:45.007
Frances, get your ass in here
or I'm gonna get nasty, now.

44:45.610 --> 44:48.579
Okay, I'll be right in.
I'm coming right in, okay?

44:48.912 --> 44:51.847
Well, hurry up, darling.
Henry's waiting.

44:53.015 --> 44:54.277
- Shit.
- What?

44:54.550 --> 44:56.484
- What?
- Frances.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.552
When he comes out,
you put his lights out.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.654
We'll grab his wallet
and get out of here.

45:00.821 --> 45:03.255
- Are you crazy?
- You wanted to rescue me, didn't you?

45:03.425 --> 45:05.416
So when he comes out,
knock him on his ass.

45:05.593 --> 45:08.756
Dear God, she is more problem
than she is worth.

45:09.763 --> 45:11.025
Here he comes.

45:11.197 --> 45:12.789
Goddamn it.

45:17.536 --> 45:19.697
How come you still
got your clothes on?

45:19.871 --> 45:21.668
What the hell's going on here, bitch?

45:21.840 --> 45:24.741
Get him, Eugene!
Get that son of a bitch, Eugene.

45:24.910 --> 45:27.845
Come on, get him!
Goddamn it! Get off of him!

45:28.012 --> 45:31.675
Back off, mister. Or these walls
will be getting a free paint job.

45:34.516 --> 45:36.848
All right, now. Just hold on.
Don't shoot.

45:37.020 --> 45:38.647
Little underdressed, Lloyd.

45:38.821 --> 45:41.016
She's right. Maybe you better
put your coat on.

45:41.189 --> 45:43.453
Listen, why don't we all
just quit here...

45:44.226 --> 45:46.319
...because...

45:46.494 --> 45:48.121
...things are getting just...

45:48.296 --> 45:49.593
Just a bit out of hand.

45:49.763 --> 45:51.856
You just have a seat
on the bed there, mister.

45:52.032 --> 45:53.260
Where'd you get the gun?

45:53.433 --> 45:55.765
Same place you got your guitar,
at the pawn shop.

45:55.935 --> 45:58.836
A bluesman never travels
the road without a pistol. No, sir.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.975
His wallet and his keys are probably
in his pants in the bathroom.

46:02.140 --> 46:04.074
You heard what the lady said,
Lightning Boy.

46:04.242 --> 46:06.369
- Are we gonna steal his car too?
- That's right.

46:06.544 --> 46:09.274
- Go get the wallet and the keys.
- Let's just get out of here.

46:09.446 --> 46:11.073
What'd you expect out here,
a picnic?

46:11.248 --> 46:14.513
Now, you gonna be somebody or you
gonna call your mama on the phone?

46:14.684 --> 46:16.174
Move.

46:16.352 --> 46:18.081
Shit.

46:21.157 --> 46:22.784
Listen, Lloyd...

46:22.958 --> 46:27.019
...we're gonna borrow that car of yours
for about 24 hours, okay?

46:27.195 --> 46:28.662
If we get any heat before then...

46:28.829 --> 46:33.425
...well, then, I'm just gonna have to tell
a statutory story, since I'm only 15.

46:33.601 --> 46:36.365
Yeah, we're gonna blow the whistle
on your family meat market.

46:36.536 --> 46:40.063
It wouldn't be too good for your
business, would it, Mr. Motel Man?

46:40.907 --> 46:43.239
Now, like the lady said, 24 hours.

46:43.408 --> 46:46.104
You'll find your car safe and sound
in the parking lot...

46:46.277 --> 46:48.541
...of the bus station
in Jacksonville, Florida.

47:08.330 --> 47:10.059
Willie teach you how
to play this thing?

47:10.230 --> 47:13.825
- No, I've been on it since I was 6.
- 6?

47:14.001 --> 47:15.764
Late bloomer, huh?

47:15.936 --> 47:19.030
It took my parents a few years to
decide what they wanted me to play.

47:19.205 --> 47:21.036
I think my father wanted me
on accordion.

47:21.206 --> 47:22.434
I was just kidding, Eugene.

47:22.608 --> 47:25.202
I mean, who the hell plays guitar
when they're 6 years old?

47:25.377 --> 47:27.777
- You're supposed to play with crayons.
- Oh, yeah?

47:27.945 --> 47:31.142
Willie, tell Frances how old you
were when you started blowing harp.

47:31.316 --> 47:34.114
Started on harmonica at 3.

47:34.284 --> 47:37.583
Made my first music dollar with
Mr. Son House at the big fish fry in...

47:37.755 --> 47:40.588
Hey, I think that was
a state trooper back there.

47:41.191 --> 47:43.955
Are you kidding?
That's a guy in an old Chrysler.

47:44.126 --> 47:45.923
Oh, yeah?
You ever hear of unmarked cars?

47:46.096 --> 47:48.223
I learned when you running,
you stay running...

47:48.396 --> 47:49.954
...till you get where you're going.

47:50.130 --> 47:52.792
Bullshit, Willie, we're driving a stolen
Cadillac here, man.

47:52.967 --> 47:55.401
We ripped off money from the guy
who owns the Cadillac.

47:55.568 --> 47:57.593
We got an 80-year-old fugitive
in the back...

47:57.771 --> 48:01.229
...a runaway in the front, man. I think
we're pushing our luck. Come on.

48:01.407 --> 48:03.136
- Pull up over there.
- Shit. What?

48:03.309 --> 48:05.209
You heard me, right over there.

48:08.345 --> 48:11.041
It's funny, I thought I'd be missing
New York by now.

48:11.215 --> 48:12.648
But I don't.

48:12.816 --> 48:17.048
I miss my mom. And I miss
my little brother, he's great.

48:17.621 --> 48:20.784
But I don't miss Hank.
He's my stepdad.

48:20.958 --> 48:23.188
He gives you a hard time?
Yells at you and shit?

48:23.359 --> 48:25.759
Hank? He hardly ever talks to me.

48:25.927 --> 48:29.624
I don't want no bullshit about papers
and licenses and that kind of stuff.

48:29.797 --> 48:31.389
You understand what I mean?

48:33.067 --> 48:36.594
Well, sir, that Cadillac you got there
is a mighty fine-looking car.

48:36.771 --> 48:38.602
Now you talking business.

48:38.773 --> 48:41.606
Well, what about your mother?
Why doesn't she throw him out?

48:41.775 --> 48:43.675
She doesn't believe it.

48:43.843 --> 48:46.641
She knows I don't like him,
so she thinks I'm making this up...

48:46.812 --> 48:48.609
...just to get him out of the house.

48:48.781 --> 48:51.807
So Hank keeps hitting on me
and I just keep running away.

48:52.250 --> 48:54.377
- You really got a dancing job?
- Oh, yeah.

48:54.553 --> 48:56.282
It's 100 bucks a night.

48:56.454 --> 48:58.513
- A hundred bucks a night?
- Yeah.

48:58.789 --> 49:00.780
Sounds like some dancing.

49:03.226 --> 49:05.888
Guys like Son House,
Charlie Patton, Robert Johnson...

49:06.061 --> 49:08.188
...they were the best slide players
in the world.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.058
Total influence on rock 'n' roll.

49:10.231 --> 49:13.598
Come on, Willie, we're gonna get you
to this barn and get some rest, okay?

49:13.767 --> 49:16.793
Don't worry, Lightning, I ain't gonna
drop down dead on you tonight.

49:17.472 --> 49:20.805
Willie was one of the last guys to play
with Robert Johnson before he died.

49:20.973 --> 49:22.964
Wait a minute.
You think he'll teach you...

49:23.143 --> 49:26.408
...this lost song you keep talking
about and that will make you famous?

49:26.578 --> 49:28.773
Right. I'm gonna learn
the tune, you know.

49:28.947 --> 49:31.347
Get it down to the note,
add a little of my own stuff.

49:31.516 --> 49:34.178
I'll make it special, but it's my ticket
to the blues scene.

49:34.351 --> 49:36.182
I hate to tell you this, Lightning Boy...

49:36.353 --> 49:38.787
...but it all sounds like
a crock of shit to me.

49:38.957 --> 49:40.219
Me too.

49:46.362 --> 49:50.093
- Hey, you feeling okay, Willie?
- Let me be now. I'm tired.

49:50.265 --> 49:52.529
All right. Look, if you need
anything, just holler.

49:52.701 --> 49:55.465
I said, let me be now. I'm tired.

50:09.148 --> 50:10.376
What's with Willie?

50:10.548 --> 50:14.006
I don't know. He looks really tired.
I mean, he's almost 80 years old.

50:14.185 --> 50:16.483
This trip's gotta be wearing him down.

50:16.654 --> 50:18.713
Jesus, if something happens
to him out here...

50:18.889 --> 50:21.153
Do you think we should get him
to a doctor?

50:21.693 --> 50:23.957
I can't. I can't.
They'll find out who he is.

50:24.127 --> 50:25.822
They'll ship him back
to Harlem to die.

50:25.995 --> 50:29.294
I'm not gonna let that happen.
I promised I'd get him home.

50:29.465 --> 50:31.729
Do you really think
there is a home, Eugene?

50:31.900 --> 50:34.061
Well, what the hell's
that supposed to mean?

50:34.636 --> 50:37.104
How are we supposed to know
he's this famous blues dude?

50:37.272 --> 50:39.706
- You got any proof?
- Well, yeah, he told me.

50:39.874 --> 50:41.705
- I trust him, that's all.
- Look, Eugene...

50:41.876 --> 50:45.368
...I'm in love with the old guy too.
He's a son of a bitch, but he's okay.

50:45.545 --> 50:48.309
But I know a con man when I see one
and I think he made up...

50:48.482 --> 50:50.541
...this whole story to get
at a gullible kid...

50:50.716 --> 50:52.911
...so he can stay out of rest homes
and hospitals.

50:53.085 --> 50:54.814
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah?

50:54.987 --> 50:57.148
What are you gonna do
if he kicks off here?

50:57.321 --> 50:59.221
- It could happen.
- He is Willie Brown.

50:59.390 --> 51:02.325
He's the first acknowledged master
of the country blues harmonica.

51:02.493 --> 51:04.120
The guy is a legend.
You understand?

51:04.295 --> 51:06.092
You're just a runaway
with a quick mouth.

51:06.263 --> 51:08.823
Why don't you get off my case.
Go migrate someplace else.

51:08.998 --> 51:11.125
Do me a favor. Leave us alone.

51:53.869 --> 51:56.360
Don't worry, I'll be out of here
in the morning.

51:58.940 --> 52:00.601
Look, I really didn't mean anything.

52:00.775 --> 52:05.735
I'm just a little rattled about
everything. Okay? I'm sorry.

52:07.481 --> 52:11.008
I'd really like you to hang with us.
I mean, I don't want you to take off.

52:12.786 --> 52:16.552
It's not like I don't like you.
I really like you.

52:24.595 --> 52:25.823
That was nice.

52:26.497 --> 52:28.727
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:58.991 --> 53:02.427
Here's one of the vagrants right here.
Keep the 12 on him.

53:02.661 --> 53:05.824
- Bring him on back.
- What you doing? What's going on?

53:05.997 --> 53:07.430
Willie, you all right? What's...?

53:07.931 --> 53:10.263
Look like we got a couple
of lovebirds up top.

53:10.434 --> 53:12.766
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, we wasn't doing nothing, officer.

53:12.935 --> 53:16.098
I'm a sick man.
These children just tending to me.

53:16.271 --> 53:17.863
Keep him quiet, Chester.

53:20.808 --> 53:23.003
Looky here, looky here.

53:23.945 --> 53:25.503
Well...

53:28.514 --> 53:30.141
I hate to inform you good folks...

53:30.317 --> 53:33.684
...but I got to be leaving you in
the hands of Sheriff Tilford.

53:36.689 --> 53:38.623
<i>Mobile weather...</i>

53:38.891 --> 53:41.621
What do you think this sheriff's
gonna do with us, Willie?

53:41.793 --> 53:43.351
I don't know.

53:43.528 --> 53:46.429
Back in my day they'd put us
in a police car like this...

53:46.597 --> 53:48.963
...and drive us way off
in the field and...

53:49.133 --> 53:50.794
Great.

53:56.372 --> 53:57.896
Look.

54:15.055 --> 54:16.613
How come they didn't find the gun?

54:17.123 --> 54:19.557
You just keep your mouth shut
about that gun, you hear?

54:19.725 --> 54:22.250
- They can't hear me.
- Keep your mouth shut anyway.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.165
Well, well...

54:31.867 --> 54:34.768
...sleeping up in Nate Edward's
barn, huh?

54:35.172 --> 54:38.437
Fooling about indecent up in the loft.

54:38.607 --> 54:40.837
Now, no identification.

54:41.010 --> 54:43.444
Electric guitar.

54:43.745 --> 54:46.441
Well, vagrants aren't real popular
in this county.

54:47.182 --> 54:49.480
Come on. Get out.

54:50.884 --> 54:53.114
O.Z., uncuff them.

54:54.287 --> 54:58.121
You don't come into my county and
break and enter an honest man's barn.

54:59.025 --> 55:02.552
But you three caught me on a morning
when I'm in a good mood.

55:03.296 --> 55:08.233
Now, once you cross that bridge,
you in Sheriff Larry Fowler's county...

55:08.399 --> 55:11.163
...and you his problem, not mine.

55:11.335 --> 55:14.771
Now, you pick up your personal
belongings and start walking.

55:14.938 --> 55:18.374
I don't like vagrants
and I don't like trespassers.

55:18.541 --> 55:21.305
- What about our money?
- What money?

55:21.810 --> 55:24.108
Your deputy took all my money
out of my bag.

55:27.448 --> 55:29.473
O.Z. didn't say nothing
about it to me.

55:30.619 --> 55:32.610
- Now, get going.
- That's not right, not fair.

55:32.787 --> 55:34.379
- Come on.
- No! You stole our money.

55:34.554 --> 55:36.044
That's not fucking fair.

55:36.923 --> 55:39.118
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

55:40.126 --> 55:42.253
Well, I tell you what I can do.

55:42.828 --> 55:45.353
I can put you in the county farm
for criminal women...

55:45.531 --> 55:48.830
...and you can stay there
while you pressing your charges.

55:49.634 --> 55:52.364
Oh, they treat you real nice out
at the county farm.

55:52.537 --> 55:54.630
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come on, let's go.

55:55.838 --> 55:59.001
Things seem to have changed
in this county.

55:59.610 --> 56:02.670
Then again, they kind of seem
the same, don't they?

56:04.346 --> 56:06.780
We just be on our way, captain.

56:06.948 --> 56:09.178
Ain't no point in making a fuss.

56:30.201 --> 56:32.396
Two rooms, $25 for the night.

56:33.638 --> 56:36.505
Just about what we got here
in the emergency fund.

56:36.973 --> 56:39.567
- You're all traveling together?
- That's right.

56:39.743 --> 56:42.075
We'll be on our way come morning.

56:49.951 --> 56:51.919
You recognize this place?

56:52.720 --> 56:55.416
- This old crossroads around here?
- Nope. Never seen it.

56:55.590 --> 56:58.115
Now, you look hard.
It's gotta be around here someplace.

56:58.291 --> 57:00.486
Ain't nothing around here
but the town of Weevil.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.753
And that's two miles down the road.

57:03.296 --> 57:05.958
Weevil. I know that old town.

57:06.132 --> 57:08.464
And I don't know nothing
about no crossroads either.

57:08.633 --> 57:11.693
- Do you know where Fulton's Point is?
- I know where that is. Come on.

57:11.870 --> 57:14.430
Let's be getting up to our rooms.

57:30.652 --> 57:33.018
I'm telling you, man, it's easy.

57:33.720 --> 57:35.813
Yes, sir. Sonny Crupp's place.

57:35.990 --> 57:39.221
Looks almost the same
as it did 40 years ago.

57:39.394 --> 57:42.830
They used to charge a good
50 cents for a glass of whiskey.

57:42.996 --> 57:44.793
That was robbery.

57:44.964 --> 57:47.489
- You know that place?
- Like yesterday.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.124
Looks like a good place
to pick up some bucks.

57:51.303 --> 57:52.736
How we gonna do that?

57:52.905 --> 57:55.169
That's my boy, green as always.

57:55.439 --> 57:57.464
I hope you wasn't too green
in that hay loft.

57:57.642 --> 58:00.475
If you wanna be a bluesman,
you gotta be able to use your whip.

58:00.644 --> 58:03.306
He was an animal, Willie.
You don't have to worry about him.

58:03.479 --> 58:08.416
- All his parts are in working order.
- Well, well, big man, ain't you?

58:09.752 --> 58:13.586
Now, you take this piece and go in
there and bring home the big eagle.

58:14.089 --> 58:17.490
You go in there and have a drink
and play a few songs.

58:17.658 --> 58:21.287
Now, they probably some rough
boys, so you keep that iron handy.

58:21.462 --> 58:23.692
What you got to say for yourself,
Long Island?

58:25.565 --> 58:27.692
I should be committed,
that's what I have to say.

58:27.866 --> 58:29.993
I should be committed
for ever listening to you.

58:30.168 --> 58:33.569
- My, my.
- What happened to Willie Brown?

58:33.738 --> 58:36.298
Greatest hobo that ever lived,
all-time great harp player.

58:36.474 --> 58:38.169
Wouldn't he walk in there
and clean up?

58:38.342 --> 58:41.778
- Sure thing. I done it lots of times.
- Problem is, I'm starting to think...

58:41.946 --> 58:45.040
...Robert Johnson's friend
Willie Brown isn't within 1000 miles.

58:45.215 --> 58:47.911
And if he is, he's probably buried
in some unmarked grave.

58:48.084 --> 58:50.484
You saying you ain't believing
what I been speaking?

58:50.653 --> 58:53.417
That's right, Willie. You're full of shit.
You know something?

58:53.589 --> 58:56.922
Every time you mention Fulton's Point,
nobody's heard of the goddamn place.

58:57.091 --> 58:59.651
I'm starting to think you're just
a con man who used me...

58:59.827 --> 59:01.954
...just to get your ass
out of a nursing home.

59:04.532 --> 59:06.159
Where are you going?

59:06.633 --> 59:10.034
Look, you smart-ass kids,
you don't need me.

59:11.604 --> 59:14.266
I do my business on this side
of the road...

59:14.439 --> 59:17.431
...and you white folks
do your business on that side.

59:17.610 --> 59:20.943
That's the way they get things done
in Mississippi.

59:48.835 --> 59:52.066
Well, well, well.
What can we do you tonight?

59:52.238 --> 59:54.934
I don't... I don't know.
Whiskey, I guess.

59:55.108 --> 59:57.269
You look kind of young. Got any ID?

59:57.442 --> 59:59.774
No, sir. Not with me, I don't.

59:59.944 --> 01:00:02.674
Well, I reckon one snort
ain't gonna hurt you.

01:00:13.756 --> 01:00:15.849
Hey, cutie, where you going?

01:00:16.091 --> 01:00:20.528
Oh, you are one pretty lady.
You're not from around here, are you?

01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:23.095
No, I just got into town.

01:00:23.263 --> 01:00:25.458
Not that we got anything
against late arrivals.

01:00:26.066 --> 01:00:27.897
- Wanna dance?
- Yeah, I do.

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:30.092
- Well, let's do it.
- All right.

01:00:32.105 --> 01:00:34.073
That'll be a dollar, friend.

01:00:35.141 --> 01:00:38.042
How about I play some
songs on my guitar for the drink?

01:00:38.209 --> 01:00:41.440
I'll stand you that drink,
then you haul ass out of here.

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:46.849
Thank you.

01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:08.863
He jumped up and started going out
the window, shouting:

01:01:09.035 --> 01:01:12.095
"Oh, shit! Here come Blind Dog!"

01:01:12.271 --> 01:01:14.831
I say, "Hey," I call out my
.38 special, see.

01:01:15.007 --> 01:01:20.309
I say, "Ain't so blind I can't see
your naked ass going out my window."

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.342
Shot him in the left side.

01:01:24.515 --> 01:01:27.279
That's how I come
to making up that song.

01:01:30.621 --> 01:01:33.647
I'm supposed to believe you
Willie Brown and Blind Dog Fulton?

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:35.484
You ain't supposed
to believe nothing.

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:38.058
Now, if you wanna do something,
here I am.

01:01:39.661 --> 01:01:41.720
Maybe later, honey.

01:01:42.129 --> 01:01:43.756
Let me through.

01:01:44.564 --> 01:01:48.500
Give me another beer and a vodka
on the rocks for a pretty lady.

01:01:58.076 --> 01:02:01.273
Yeah, I think I might have
to dance here.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.138
Okay, where is it?

01:02:03.314 --> 01:02:05.373
- What?
- My wallet.

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:06.778
What are you trying to say?

01:02:06.952 --> 01:02:09.011
Come on, you little thief,
cough it up.

01:02:09.186 --> 01:02:11.450
- What, you think I took your wallet?
- That's right.

01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:14.647
- Go ahead and search me.
- Well, I just believe I will.

01:02:14.824 --> 01:02:16.951
Come on, why don't you get
your hands off her.

01:02:17.127 --> 01:02:19.357
- This your lady?
- Yeah, she's with me.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.963
Well, she snagged my wallet
and she don't wanna give it back.

01:02:23.131 --> 01:02:26.191
- She said she didn't take it. Did you?
- No, I didn't take his wallet.

01:02:26.366 --> 01:02:29.699
And he'd better shut his mouth
before my friend takes out his gun.

01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.463
- A gun?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.638 --> 01:02:33.868
- You got a gun?
- Yeah.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.032
- Let me see it.
- Go ahead, show it to him.

01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:38.507
Go on. Come on.

01:02:40.078 --> 01:02:42.706
Fella comes in here, packing a gun.

01:02:42.881 --> 01:02:44.109
I don't want any trouble.

01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:46.374
- It's not my gun.
- Hey!

01:02:47.318 --> 01:02:50.310
- Holy shit. I don't want any trouble.
- Hand that piece over.

01:02:50.488 --> 01:02:52.251
- Don't you dare.
- Will you just come on?

01:02:52.423 --> 01:02:53.981
- Great, fine.
- I don't want the gun.

01:02:54.156 --> 01:02:56.181
I just wanna get out of here.
Let's get out.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.021
Now, now, hold it, hold it.

01:02:58.194 --> 01:02:59.718
Now, you can get out of here.

01:02:59.895 --> 01:03:01.920
- I just wanna give you something.
- Duck!

01:03:04.266 --> 01:03:06.325
You son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch, Harley!

01:03:09.302 --> 01:03:11.862
Now, hold it just a goddamn minute.

01:03:12.038 --> 01:03:16.236
There ain't gonna be no more fighting.
Harley, Alvin, you settle down.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.874
Did you take his wallet, miss?
Because if you did, give it back to him.

01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:24.948
Harley's dumb, but that don't mean
he deserves to have his wallet stolen.

01:03:25.117 --> 01:03:27.381
He's got a family
and they need the money.

01:03:36.793 --> 01:03:40.092
You both got a lot of growing up to do.
Now, get on out of here.

01:03:41.931 --> 01:03:44.365
All right, now, let's everybody
get back to drinking!

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.060
What you doing in here, honey?

01:04:18.228 --> 01:04:20.389
You on the wrong side
of the tracks, ain't you?

01:04:22.699 --> 01:04:25.634
You looking for Crupp's.
Crupp's across the road.

01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:27.960
No, we were there already.
We're just...

01:04:28.137 --> 01:04:30.298
We're just looking for a friend,
that's all.

01:04:35.977 --> 01:04:37.808
You see this boy, Ledell?

01:04:37.978 --> 01:04:41.175
You come in the juke with your guitar,
dressed to play?

01:04:41.514 --> 01:04:43.072
In a black man's juke?

01:04:43.649 --> 01:04:47.278
I'm surprised you can walk, boy.
You got balls this big.

01:04:51.823 --> 01:04:53.723
Let's take his guitar from him.

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:08.535
Yes, sir, people!
The Lightning Boy has arrived...

01:05:08.704 --> 01:05:12.037
...and if you'd be so kind to let him
and his girl toward the stage...

01:05:12.207 --> 01:05:14.368
...we gonna blow
the roof off this joint.

01:05:14.709 --> 01:05:16.643
Let him to the stage, I say!

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:19.301
I said, let him toward the stage.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.004
Now, this boy's come a long way...

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:23.341
...to show you how good
he can play that thing.

01:05:23.515 --> 01:05:25.745
You wanna hear some music, people?

01:05:27.286 --> 01:05:28.651
Come on up here.

01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.980
How's the Lightning Boy? Yeah.

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:37.026
What's wrong with you?
I told you not to come in here.

01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:39.662
I got some heat from the other side.
I lost the gun too.

01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:42.093
You dumb shit, we gonna
get heat from this side...

01:05:42.264 --> 01:05:43.822
...if we don't take them back home.

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:45.883
That's Willie Brown!

01:06:46.052 --> 01:06:49.112
- That's Willie Brown up there singing.
- It is?

01:06:49.289 --> 01:06:52.190
Sure, I used to see him all the time
when I was tiny.

01:06:52.357 --> 01:06:55.588
Used to play for all the big ones.
Yeah, that's him.

01:06:56.361 --> 01:06:58.829
- He's a friend of mine.
- A friend of yours?

01:06:58.996 --> 01:07:00.486
Yeah.

01:07:25.852 --> 01:07:27.683
Willie Brown,
prince of the Delta blues...

01:07:27.854 --> 01:07:30.482
...blows into a juke house
that's been dead for 40 years...

01:07:30.656 --> 01:07:32.089
...and turns it inside out, man.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:34.782
And who was up there filling
Robert Johnson's shoes, huh?

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.188
A dipshit from Long Island.

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.055
Come on. I was great and you know it.

01:07:38.229 --> 01:07:40.857
The owner walked up to Willie,
gave him $300 and says:

01:07:41.031 --> 01:07:42.396
"Your boy can play."

01:07:42.566 --> 01:07:44.625
They know what they're
talking about down here.

01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:46.792
- You guys were terrific.
- You guys? Us guys.

01:07:46.969 --> 01:07:49.130
Don't count yourself out.

01:07:49.871 --> 01:07:51.862
Looks like Weevil's
right outside Vicksburg...

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:55.066
...which is 30 miles shy of
Yazoo County. You're almost there.

01:07:55.243 --> 01:07:57.837
Willie says that's the most beautiful
land in the state.

01:07:58.012 --> 01:07:59.570
I think we should hang with Willie.

01:07:59.747 --> 01:08:02.944
We should settle into Fulton's Point
until he teaches me the lost song.

01:08:03.117 --> 01:08:04.948
Then we'll get a van
and tour the country.

01:08:05.118 --> 01:08:07.143
Blind Dog, Lightning Boy,
peddling lost blues.

01:08:07.321 --> 01:08:09.846
- This stuff is happening...
- Yeah, it sounds great.

01:08:10.022 --> 01:08:13.753
- What do I get to do, drive the van?
- We could get a Blazer. We could go...

01:08:13.926 --> 01:08:15.154
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:15.328 --> 01:08:17.626
Here he is, prince of the Delta blues,
Willie Brown!

01:08:17.795 --> 01:08:21.162
Bright lights fry your brain? I guess
that's why you forgot your hat.

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:23.858
I just played my first barrelhouse.
I'm a bluesman now.

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:27.834
Bluesman, shit. Only one bluesman
in town tonight, that was me.

01:08:28.004 --> 01:08:30.939
Where you learn to play them
pussy chords, in music school?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.542
Only one school. I played the chords
I learned on the road and I kicked ass.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.701
People felt it,
so don't give me that garbage.

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.346
People felt whiskey.
Same as I'm feeling right now.

01:08:39.514 --> 01:08:41.675
And just about to feel some more.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:44.148
Hey, Willie, lay off him, okay?
He was great.

01:08:44.317 --> 01:08:47.115
- Got a problem with that?
- He's on the road to learn something.

01:08:47.287 --> 01:08:49.846
Now, he can't be learning
if he's thinking he's the boss...

01:08:50.022 --> 01:08:51.683
You won't give an inch, will you?

01:08:51.856 --> 01:08:54.290
You can't even come in here
and say, "Nice job, kid."

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.323
You can't even give me
a "congratulations."

01:08:56.495 --> 01:08:57.962
You know what you want,
Lightning?

01:08:58.130 --> 01:08:59.620
You want me to stand here
and say:

01:08:59.798 --> 01:09:02.288
"Boy, you as good as Robert
Johnson." But you ain't.

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:05.435
Now, if you'd spend as much time
with your hands on them strings...

01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:08.629
...as you do on this girl's ass,
you might get somewhere.

01:09:08.804 --> 01:09:14.800
Excuse me, I think I'll go to my room
and leave you two lovebirds be.

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:26.149
He's a mean, shitty old man.

01:09:54.678 --> 01:09:56.908
Shame on you, Willie Brown...

01:09:57.079 --> 01:10:00.344
...traveling all the way back down
home as if you had a chance.

01:10:00.516 --> 01:10:04.282
Ain't got no chance, Blind Dog.
You sold your soul.

01:10:04.451 --> 01:10:07.477
You going down.
All the way down.

01:10:07.654 --> 01:10:12.591
Hellhounds on your trail, boy.
Hellhounds on your trail.

01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:28.435
All right.

01:10:30.474 --> 01:10:31.736
Why you sneaking around?

01:10:31.908 --> 01:10:33.671
- I'm going.
- Going where?

01:10:33.842 --> 01:10:36.470
Gotta get to L.A. I'm just like
you and Eugene, you know.

01:10:36.646 --> 01:10:38.045
I got places to go.

01:10:38.213 --> 01:10:39.510
What about the boy?
You know...

01:10:39.682 --> 01:10:42.446
There's no goodbyes on the road.
It doesn't work that way.

01:10:43.384 --> 01:10:46.148
You give Lightning Boy
a hug for me, okay?

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.311
Tell him I'll miss him.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:06.293
You're right.
Ain't no goodbyes on the road.

01:11:07.337 --> 01:11:08.964
See you around, huh?

01:11:10.942 --> 01:11:13.934
- What's this?
- $ 100 take care of you for a while.

01:11:14.111 --> 01:11:17.512
Keep you out of trouble.
Get you to L.A. safe.

01:11:17.681 --> 01:11:19.205
I don't want you having to deal...

01:11:19.382 --> 01:11:21.816
...with no more of them
motel men, you understand?

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:24.451
Jesus, I can't believe you.

01:11:25.854 --> 01:11:27.947
Go ahead.
Take care of yourself.

01:11:28.123 --> 01:11:30.489
I'll miss you, Willie.

01:12:13.962 --> 01:12:15.691
Willie, where's Frances?

01:12:19.198 --> 01:12:21.359
What, is she getting breakfast?

01:12:22.501 --> 01:12:24.799
Willie, where's Frances?

01:12:24.970 --> 01:12:26.369
Where'd she go?

01:13:25.355 --> 01:13:28.620
Look, Willie, I know I'm not supposed
to feel sorry for myself.

01:13:28.856 --> 01:13:30.949
And I know that you've
been through things...

01:13:31.125 --> 01:13:34.117
...that are a million times
tougher than my life's been...

01:13:34.294 --> 01:13:36.489
...but I'm gonna miss her.

01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:38.790
I'm really gonna miss her.

01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:41.792
A man with a whole
lot of sense said:

01:13:41.968 --> 01:13:46.064
"Blues ain't nothing
but a good man feeling bad...

01:13:46.239 --> 01:13:49.538
...thinking about the woman
he once was with."

01:13:54.645 --> 01:13:56.772
You're gonna teach me the song.

01:13:59.884 --> 01:14:01.613
Ain't no song.

01:14:02.285 --> 01:14:05.482
I'm sorry, Eugene. I lied to you.

01:14:05.654 --> 01:14:08.714
I just wanted to get
out of that place so bad.

01:14:09.491 --> 01:14:12.119
Robert give us 29 songs.

01:14:12.292 --> 01:14:14.487
It was enough.

01:14:14.662 --> 01:14:17.722
Never was a number 30,
not that I know of.

01:14:17.898 --> 01:14:19.365
You gotta do it for yourself.

01:14:19.533 --> 01:14:22.093
That's what Robert
would have told you.

01:15:36.497 --> 01:15:38.362
Lots of towns...

01:15:38.532 --> 01:15:40.466
...lots of songs...

01:15:40.634 --> 01:15:42.659
...lots of women.

01:15:42.836 --> 01:15:45.896
Good times. Bad times.

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:49.868
The only thing
I want anybody to say is:

01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:52.771
"He could really play.

01:15:52.945 --> 01:15:55.209
He was good."

01:16:49.959 --> 01:16:51.290
What are we stopping here for?

01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:54.020
Why don't we head on
to Fulton's Point? It can't be far.

01:16:54.197 --> 01:16:56.631
I gotta deal with something,
Lightning.

01:16:56.798 --> 01:16:59.824
- Or there ain't no going home.
- What are you talking about?

01:17:00.001 --> 01:17:01.525
What do you have to deal with?

01:17:01.702 --> 01:17:04.102
Yeah, this is the one.

01:17:04.271 --> 01:17:07.434
The hottest cathouse in
the great state of Mississippi.

01:17:07.608 --> 01:17:09.633
Is this another lesson, Willie?

01:17:09.809 --> 01:17:12.073
You listen and you'll find out.

01:17:12.245 --> 01:17:14.440
These are some old friends of mine.

01:17:21.852 --> 01:17:26.050
A woman named
Lily La Fontaine still live here?

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:29.654
Lily dead, long time.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:32.718
You related?

01:17:32.896 --> 01:17:35.126
She was my grandma.

01:17:35.297 --> 01:17:37.094
You a friend of her?

01:17:37.265 --> 01:17:38.493
Yes, ma'am.

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:41.465
I used to make music here
when Lily run the place.

01:17:41.636 --> 01:17:43.228
Where are all the girls?

01:17:43.403 --> 01:17:45.462
Boarding house now.

01:17:45.639 --> 01:17:47.766
Got a room open.

01:17:47.941 --> 01:17:52.105
That one over there keep wet
his mattress, so he going.

01:17:52.979 --> 01:17:57.006
Lily always say you play
all the time and flirt with the girls...

01:17:57.182 --> 01:18:00.515
...and always in some mess
with the law.

01:18:00.987 --> 01:18:02.887
Glad to be remembered.

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:05.113
It was such a long time ago.

01:18:05.288 --> 01:18:08.451
My grandma talk about you a lot.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:11.755
She was a real good woman,
your grandma.

01:18:14.697 --> 01:18:19.293
I remember me and Slim Waterman
got into a fight over her one time.

01:18:20.134 --> 01:18:24.833
A real knockdown,
gouge-your-eyes-out kind of fight.

01:18:25.006 --> 01:18:27.566
Oh, yeah? Who won?

01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:30.767
I don't know,
I guess we both took our lumps.

01:18:30.945 --> 01:18:33.812
But she was a real good woman.

01:18:36.548 --> 01:18:39.039
Somewhere around here...

01:18:39.217 --> 01:18:42.311
...there's a real special place.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:49.988
A crossroads.

01:18:53.162 --> 01:18:55.892
You know the language I'm talking?

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:02.261
I need to get back to the crossroads.

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:05.070
You tell me how to get there?

01:19:13.813 --> 01:19:15.508
Holice?

01:19:15.682 --> 01:19:16.944
Holice.

01:19:17.115 --> 01:19:21.552
You drive these fellas out on
Grange Road, past Dockery's.

01:19:40.969 --> 01:19:43.062
This is it.

01:19:43.906 --> 01:19:47.865
This is the place
where it all happened.

01:19:48.509 --> 01:19:49.806
I tell you what you gotta do.

01:19:49.976 --> 01:19:52.308
See, you go on over there
and start playing a piece.

01:19:52.479 --> 01:19:54.003
Why?

01:19:54.282 --> 01:19:56.443
Because there's a fella
I've got to see.

01:19:56.616 --> 01:19:59.380
And if you're playing it right,
he's gonna come around.

01:19:59.552 --> 01:20:02.350
Yeah, right, Willie.
Who is this guy?

01:20:02.987 --> 01:20:07.219
Don't ask me who.
You know damn well who.

01:20:38.217 --> 01:20:40.549
Keep it going. You standing
at the crossroad now.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.085
This is where it count.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.449
Thought I wasn't supposed
to go to the crossroads.

01:20:44.624 --> 01:20:47.286
We ain't here for you,
we here for me.

01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:10.505
Y'all need a ride?

01:21:10.678 --> 01:21:13.169
What you waiting for, huh?

01:21:13.347 --> 01:21:16.180
Come on, Willie.
Let's get to Fulton's Point.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.242
What time he coming around?

01:21:18.418 --> 01:21:20.648
What time who coming around?

01:21:21.154 --> 01:21:23.315
You don't be fooling with me.

01:21:23.488 --> 01:21:24.819
I'm talking about Legba.

01:21:26.292 --> 01:21:28.260
Legba?
Where you been at, slick?

01:21:28.426 --> 01:21:31.361
He done changed
his name to Scratch.

01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:34.590
I don't want none of your sass.
I got business with the man.

01:21:34.764 --> 01:21:36.789
Mean old bastard, ain't you?

01:21:36.967 --> 01:21:39.026
Forget it, honey. He's crazy.

01:21:39.202 --> 01:21:40.931
Now, y'all sure you don't need a ride?

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:44.097
Ain't riding with
the likes of you, smart-ass.

01:21:44.273 --> 01:21:45.501
Or your bitch neither.

01:21:48.377 --> 01:21:51.813
Suit yourself, old man.

01:21:55.615 --> 01:21:57.845
You looking for me, Willie Brown?

01:21:58.019 --> 01:22:01.011
Been a long time, hasn't it, Willie?

01:22:02.388 --> 01:22:04.185
Yes, yes, it has.

01:22:04.357 --> 01:22:08.293
- Willie, what's going on here?
- Yes, sir, been a long time.

01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:11.089
You about 17 last time
we saw each other.

01:22:11.262 --> 01:22:13.355
One night on this old crossroads,
wasn't it?

01:22:14.399 --> 01:22:16.196
What can I do for you,
Willie Brown?

01:22:16.366 --> 01:22:18.891
I come to see you,
tell you the deal's off.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:22.469
Oh, no.

01:22:22.638 --> 01:22:25.630
According to this here piece of paper,
the deal's still on.

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:28.537
You can tear that up
and give me some peace.

01:22:28.711 --> 01:22:30.508
Why on Earth would I wanna do that?

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.544
Now, you sloughed up
on your end of things.

01:22:32.714 --> 01:22:36.047
I didn't end up where I wanted.
I didn't end up with nothing. Nothing!

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.811
You got what you were
supposed to get, bluesman.

01:22:38.986 --> 01:22:41.648
Ain't nothing ever as good
as we want it to be.

01:22:41.821 --> 01:22:45.917
But that ain't no reason
to break a deal.

01:22:46.259 --> 01:22:48.159
Of course...

01:22:48.327 --> 01:22:50.227
...if you had something to offer me.

01:22:50.396 --> 01:22:52.159
I got a couple of hundred dollars.

01:22:53.431 --> 01:22:57.527
I ain't interested in your money,
you know that.

01:23:00.003 --> 01:23:01.436
How about cutting heads?

01:23:03.974 --> 01:23:06.704
Oh, I get it.
You want some kind of contest.

01:23:06.877 --> 01:23:10.074
You're a real smart boy, ain't you?

01:23:10.345 --> 01:23:11.869
Well, smart boy...

01:23:13.681 --> 01:23:15.774
...I got a big white fella
from Memphis...

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:18.281
...made a deal with me
a few years back.

01:23:18.453 --> 01:23:21.047
Real good guitar player,
name of Jack Butler.

01:23:21.221 --> 01:23:24.156
Cuts heads every Saturday night.
Yes, sir.

01:23:24.324 --> 01:23:26.918
He discourages a lot
of up-and-coming boys.

01:23:27.093 --> 01:23:29.584
- But Willie doesn't even play guitar.
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:29.762 --> 01:23:31.753
I forgot that.

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:33.760
Ain't that too bad.

01:23:34.799 --> 01:23:38.030
Guess there ain't much hope
at all for Willie Brown.

01:23:42.573 --> 01:23:44.700
Unless you might wanna
sit in for him.

01:23:44.874 --> 01:23:46.432
- Don't do it.
- Sure, he's my friend.

01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:50.478
- I don't believe in any of this shit.
- I said, don't do it, Lightning.

01:23:50.646 --> 01:23:52.375
You win...

01:23:52.547 --> 01:23:54.378
...I tear up Willie's contract.

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:57.781
But what happens
if my man Jack Butler win?

01:24:00.922 --> 01:24:02.446
You get me.

01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:05.319
I already got you.

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:09.317
- Well, then, you got me too.
- Shut up, you hear?

01:24:09.495 --> 01:24:11.622
- I don't want you making no deals.
- Take it easy.

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:15.129
I'm just calling his bluff for you.
We'll get to Fulton's Point after this.

01:24:15.301 --> 01:24:16.632
Where and when for this thing?

01:24:16.801 --> 01:24:19.497
Oh, I can get us there real quick.

01:24:19.671 --> 01:24:22.071
Jack Butler's gonna like you.

01:25:28.862 --> 01:25:30.955
You know what I got here?

01:25:31.896 --> 01:25:33.557
This is the mojo man.

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.701
The Louisiana voodoo charm.

01:25:36.868 --> 01:25:39.769
The winning boy's magic.

01:25:39.938 --> 01:25:43.533
You see, there's only one
last true mojo left in the world.

01:25:44.575 --> 01:25:45.803
Take it, Lightning.

01:25:46.175 --> 01:25:48.370
Take it and go up there
and do your stuff.

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:52.708
I'm giving you all the magic I got.

01:25:58.686 --> 01:26:01.348
Who's next up there?

01:26:01.523 --> 01:26:05.357
Who's coming on up?
Who's gonna get their head cut?

01:26:07.227 --> 01:26:10.094
How about you, chicken boy?

01:26:28.712 --> 01:26:31.374
Well, well, well.

01:26:31.548 --> 01:26:32.776
Who sent you here?

01:26:33.616 --> 01:26:35.174
Can't talk, little man?

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.417
Bet can't play none either.

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:25.527
Now, don't be standing there with
that dumb look on your face. Let's go.

01:35:25.696 --> 01:35:29.723
I'm sick of this
down-home Mississippi.

01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:32.892
Living up north made
a city boy out of me.

01:35:33.070 --> 01:35:35.630
I hear Chicago calling.

01:35:35.805 --> 01:35:39.366
B.B. King and Johnny Shines saying:

01:35:39.541 --> 01:35:42.408
"Where's the new kid in town?"

01:35:42.577 --> 01:35:44.238
You ready for the Windy City?

01:35:44.412 --> 01:35:46.243
Sure, I was born ready.
Let's go get them.

01:35:46.413 --> 01:35:49.940
All right. Now, after I show you
Chicago, you're on your own.

01:35:50.117 --> 01:35:52.312
- You understand?
- Wait. Why can't I hang with you?

01:35:52.485 --> 01:35:55.010
I mean, after Chicago,
we can move on to L.A.

01:35:55.422 --> 01:35:57.185
That ain't the way the song go.

01:35:57.356 --> 01:35:59.221
You gotta move on without me.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:01.517
Take the music someplace else.

01:36:01.694 --> 01:36:03.594
Take it past where you found it.

01:36:03.762 --> 01:36:05.923
Because that's what we did.

01:36:06.797 --> 01:36:08.355
We got a deal?

01:36:11.401 --> 01:36:12.993
All right.

01:36:17.206 --> 01:36:19.640
- You know something, Lightning?
- What?

01:36:19.808 --> 01:36:22.333
I'm tired of all this walking
and hitchhiking.

01:36:22.511 --> 01:36:25.639
I wanna go to Chicago in style.

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:28.714
I wanna fly in an airplane.

01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:35.208
