00:59.192 --> 01:04.250
<i>Tonight, investigators are questioning
the credibility of those clinical trials.</i>

01:04.349 --> 01:09.203
<i>I'm very angry. I can't believe doctors
could betray so many people.</i>

01:09.303 --> 01:14.007
<i>I was part of the initial test group
for the drug Vypraxilin.</i>

01:14.207 --> 01:19.231
<i>And... I can say without a doubt
it was probably the worst decision</i>

01:19.331 --> 01:20.948
<i>I've ever made in my life.</i>

01:21.048 --> 01:23.317
<i>These people knowingly
put out inaccurate information</i>

01:23.417 --> 01:26.153
<i>and they were being selective
in the facts about the case.</i>

01:26.253 --> 01:30.357
<i>She looked at me and then collapsed.</i>

01:30.457 --> 01:33.317
<i>Her mouth filled with blood and...</i>

01:34.211 --> 01:35.565
<i>and it was terrifying.</i>

01:35.665 --> 01:40.668
<i>In fact, an investigation by the FDA
found no evidence of false data</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:43.383
<i>from Pierson Pharmaceuticals.</i>

01:43.983 --> 01:46.974
<i>This is the third death
attributed to the medication,</i>

01:47.074 --> 01:50.844
<i>with many more claims surfacing each day.</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:53.504
<i>They need to be held accountable.</i>

01:56.783 --> 02:00.187
We should just leave
and go to London for a while.

02:00.287 --> 02:05.059
Wouldn't that seem guilty
if I just left the country?

02:05.159 --> 02:08.795
And what would you tell them
if they accuse you? The truth?

02:08.895 --> 02:13.290
Well, I've faced inquiries before.
I can... I'm not gonna run away.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.505
I'm not talking about running away, Arthur.
I'm talking about clearing your head.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.806
Getting out of town together like we said.

02:19.906 --> 02:21.674
Yeah.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.625
Yeah?

02:25.111 --> 02:28.477
- Just give him a little privacy.
- Don't talk to me.

02:29.382 --> 02:34.132
You tell Dr. Shuman to get back in the lab
immediately and get this thing sorted out.

02:34.421 --> 02:37.557
Immediately. You do it,
or I'll get someone else who can.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.709
Just do it.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.929
Now.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.598
Okay, look, I got to get back to the...

02:44.698 --> 02:49.003
I'm going back to the office. They can't do
anything unless I'm there holding their hand.

02:49.103 --> 02:51.805
Why don't you ever consider
anything I say to you?

02:51.905 --> 02:54.175
It's your greatest fault. You know that?

02:54.275 --> 02:56.777
You know what, maybe I'll just
leave town without you, Arthur.

02:56.877 --> 03:00.181
Come on. Graham will take you home
and I'll see you tonight.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.682
- Okay.
- Emily, come on.

03:01.782 --> 03:06.036
- Stop being a child. Grow up.
- Fuck you.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.572
Let her go.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.342
Emily?

03:16.296 --> 03:18.548
She'll come around.

03:25.872 --> 03:29.543
- Our exposure's limited at best.
- Oh, yeah?

03:29.643 --> 03:32.513
Well, there's no such thing
as limited exposure.

03:32.613 --> 03:36.811
Got the deposition tomorrow and I need you
to cover this. Get Jake Coburn in legal.

03:36.911 --> 03:38.519
I want a strategy before I leave.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.222
Sir, we advise you against answering
any questions at this time.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.339
Duly noted.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.078
Emily?

03:58.771 --> 04:00.657
Emily!

04:12.785 --> 04:15.656
Where the hell is she? Emily!

04:15.756 --> 04:18.108
I'm gonna grab you some dinner.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.810
I'll call in the usual.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.971
Don't step anywhere inside this house.
Don't touch anything.

05:04.071 --> 05:07.207
Get security up here right now.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.125
Yes, sir.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.947
So there was no more contact
after you left the park?

05:14.047 --> 05:17.418
I figured it was just another call
for attention. That's all.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.320
Yeah, it could be.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.457
Jane is the advisor we retained.
Private org. Kidnap and rescue.

05:23.757 --> 05:27.244
I should advise you, sir,
to involve the FBI.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.780
I've employed you so I don't have to.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.902
Right now, your girlfriend
is alone and scared

05:35.002 --> 05:36.870
and praying that someone
will save her life.

05:36.970 --> 05:40.257
In 11 hours, Emily could be home or dead.

05:40.357 --> 05:43.910
If this is gonna work you're gonna
have to trust me. You understand?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.046
So what are the next steps?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.832
The tech team is working
on your phone to trace the sender.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.352
When these people reach out again
and we know what they want,

05:51.452 --> 05:54.822
Jane will help color who they are.
They need us to open up.

05:54.922 --> 05:58.225
All confidential passwords,
everything will need to be transparent.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.995
Tell me, are they likely
to harm her, hurt her?

06:02.095 --> 06:03.036
Yes.

06:03.136 --> 06:05.666
You don't sugarcoat
your responses, do you?

06:05.766 --> 06:08.217
Why the fuck would I do that?

06:31.958 --> 06:33.827
What do they want?

06:33.927 --> 06:36.630
Two and a half million dollars, unmarked.

06:36.730 --> 06:40.668
Octavia gallery by 1:00 p.m.
or they cut her open.

06:40.768 --> 06:42.136
Can your team prep by 1:00?

06:42.236 --> 06:45.406
It'll be tight. It's lunchtime.
There's lots of exits.

06:45.506 --> 06:49.476
We can expect heavy foot traffic.
We'll have snipers cover the exterior.

06:49.576 --> 06:52.313
Snipers? We don't need snipers.
I've got the cash.

06:52.413 --> 06:55.506
Let's do this civilly and quietly.

07:09.261 --> 07:11.472
<i>I'm right behind you.</i>

07:19.872 --> 07:22.108
<i>You tailing him?</i>

07:22.208 --> 07:24.885
Yeah, I've got eyes on him.

07:27.213 --> 07:31.338
<i>Do not turn around.
Do not acknowledge that you can hear me.</i>

07:34.020 --> 07:37.198
<i>Wait for them to approach you,
Mr. Denning.</i>

07:41.361 --> 07:44.972
<i>You have him?
He's out of my line of sight, Jane.</i>

07:45.731 --> 07:47.575
Relax.

07:56.776 --> 08:01.022
I know this is hard,
but I need you to stay calm as ice.

08:05.384 --> 08:09.055
- <i>Approaching on your right.</i>
- She remind you of someone you know?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.824
Yeah.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.968
Like most women, she's expensive.

08:15.027 --> 08:19.433
- You want to talk a deal?
- <i>Drop the bag. Just drop the bag.</i>

08:19.533 --> 08:21.934
Let's go somewhere quiet.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.942
Okay.

08:25.872 --> 08:29.243
Do not follow him.
Mr. Denning, you have to trust me.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.552
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

08:32.962 --> 08:35.015
<i>What's he looking at?
Why is he stopping? Jane?</i>

08:35.115 --> 08:37.096
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- <i>He's off script.</i>

08:37.196 --> 08:40.572
<i>Stop, Mr. Denning. You're putting your life
at risk. This could part of their plan.</i>

08:40.672 --> 08:43.222
<i>Drop the money.
Give it to him, then we'll go away.</i>

08:43.323 --> 08:45.500
Just one thing.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.832
You see what happens
when you fuck with me?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.367
- Where's Emily?
- Who?

08:53.467 --> 08:55.970
- Where is she?
- I don't know what you're saying!

08:56.370 --> 08:59.432
You hurt her? Where's Emily?

09:01.874 --> 09:05.686
<i>Jane? What the fuck just happened?</i>

09:09.181 --> 09:12.018
<i>He just attacked him.
Get him out of here now.</i>

09:12.118 --> 09:14.595
<i>Get him out.</i>

09:42.848 --> 09:44.659
Yeah.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.588
Oh, come on. Don't turn into that guy.

09:47.688 --> 09:51.091
You just won an estate claim where
the widow's husband didn't have a will.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.152
It's time to party. Call your wife.

09:54.252 --> 10:00.007
Tell her to bring a friend, actually...
maybe a chesty one, some kind of assets.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.539
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna take out your wife myself.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.615
Since when are you interested in women?

10:08.975 --> 10:12.379
Ben Cahill, was that a joke? That was fun.

10:12.479 --> 10:15.783
- Eleven straight. Congrats.
- Any calls?

10:15.883 --> 10:18.599
Hatty, you're gonna have to excuse Ben.
That's how he shows his joy.

10:18.699 --> 10:22.019
Right. Couple folks from
the Lake Avenue construction case,

10:22.119 --> 10:25.092
that Chinese guy from Shai Fen
Associates, and your wife.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.862
Okay. Can you ask the paralegals
why those Flynn V. Benson files

10:28.962 --> 10:31.338
- haven't shown up yet, please?
- Yeah.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.436
You have been a machine
for over a year now.

10:35.836 --> 10:39.112
I know you and Charlotte have had
a devastating few months, but...

10:39.212 --> 10:42.550
billing 100 hours a week is not
gonna help you get through that.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.545
It's not gonna help you make partner,

10:45.645 --> 10:48.419
and it's not gonna keep our wife happy.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.125
You've got to get out of this office.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.956
Wow, you are no fun at all. Okay.

10:56.056 --> 10:59.781
Well, I'll take that. Thank you.

11:32.057 --> 11:35.928
- You trying to scare me?
- Well, you just look so focused over there.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.432
- You got good news?
- Another win.

11:40.232 --> 11:43.369
So I was hoping maybe we could celebrate.

11:43.469 --> 11:45.813
I can't. I picked up another shift.

11:46.906 --> 11:49.076
All right, well...

11:49.176 --> 11:51.752
I guess I'll see you in 36 hours.

11:53.179 --> 11:57.017
- You know we're understaffed.
- No, no, no, no. I get it. I get it.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.060
There's chicken pie
in the oven if you're hungry.

12:01.787 --> 12:04.699
I hate waking up without you, Charlie.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.330
Well...

12:12.264 --> 12:14.641
You wanna go on a date?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.936
Yeah.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.838
When?

12:18.938 --> 12:20.448
When I'm done.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.818
Deal.

12:26.812 --> 12:30.324
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

13:17.496 --> 13:19.940
Emily Hynes?

13:31.644 --> 13:35.048
- You didn't accept, did you?
- She had her issues, but it's not like I...

13:35.148 --> 13:39.186
Issues? Yeah. You broke her heart.
She threatened suicide. That's not normal.

13:39.486 --> 13:42.530
I remember some pretty manipulative shit.

13:43.522 --> 13:46.321
I'm actually impressed someone
your age knows how to use social media.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.161
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.596
Is that right?

13:49.696 --> 13:52.332
- You accepted the friend request, didn't you?
- So what if I did?

13:52.432 --> 13:54.267
- Your wife's a 12!
- Yeah.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.570
She's far more attractive than you.
She's far more intelligent than you.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.673
- Frankly, you don't deserve her.
- Yeah, well...

14:00.773 --> 14:04.377
- Don't break the only good thing in your life.
- I'm not breaking anything.

14:04.477 --> 14:08.548
Charlie and I are fine, all right?
I love my wife.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.350
We've had a rough year, but you know what?

14:10.450 --> 14:13.500
I'm not gonna mess it up over some
stupid fucking friend request.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.799
Just keep talking to your ex. Keep talking
to Emily. I think that's a good idea.

14:16.899 --> 14:21.894
You're gonna spend your 4:00 a.m.'s drunk,
eating burritos over the sink.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.472
I love burritos.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.775
- Yeah, I kind of love them, too.
- Yeah.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.863
God, really?

14:49.355 --> 14:51.632
Paranoid much?

14:52.992 --> 14:55.562
You're three minutes
and 32 seconds late, pal.

14:55.662 --> 14:59.018
Oh, yeah? Well, you're looking sharp.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.812
- The estate claim cashed in?
- Yep.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.015
So I take it the info
I put in Mrs. Takiff's file worked?

15:15.115 --> 15:18.618
Mrs. Takiff would have lost everything
if we wouldn't have helped her.

15:18.718 --> 15:22.923
I already starting fixing
this new Benson vs. Flynn file.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.826
I was thinking, one of these days,
you may actually win a case without cheating.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.928
It's not cheating...

15:29.228 --> 15:31.638
not if the good guy wins.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.976
So you're the good guy.

16:18.844 --> 16:21.414
- Emily! How are you doing?
- Hi. I'm great. How are you?

16:21.514 --> 16:25.017
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.001
- Is it 10 years?
- I think so, yeah.

16:27.101 --> 16:29.923
- It's been 10 years? Oh, my God! Yeah.
- Can you believe it?

16:30.023 --> 16:32.559
You are not a lawyer.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.829
- Is that so hard to believe? Really?
- Yes, yes, it is so hard to believe.

16:35.929 --> 16:39.632
The undisputed beer pong champ really,
goes on to do great things.

16:39.732 --> 16:43.036
Well, nothing screams success
like a student loan that I can't pay off.

16:43.136 --> 16:46.992
Come on, Ben. You knew what you wanted,
and you went for it. I think that's great.

16:47.092 --> 16:48.575
Yeah.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.077
Ambition always was one
of the sexiest things about you.

16:51.177 --> 16:53.853
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

16:56.015 --> 17:00.787
- So what about you? How you been?
- I've been fine, yeah.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.156
Yeah? Seems like you've been
having a good old time,

17:04.257 --> 17:07.227
judging by your half-naked photos
that I saw online.

17:07.327 --> 17:12.065
Oh, you've been... Really?
You've been cyberstalking me, Ben?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.833
I wasn't cyberstalk... I was just...

17:14.933 --> 17:17.569
- Intrigued. I was intrigued.
- Oh, intrigued, okay.

17:17.670 --> 17:21.474
- I was curious. That's all.
- Okay.

17:22.124 --> 17:24.935
So how is it being married?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.814
It's complicated.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.051
"I do. You do."
Seems pretty self-explanatory to me.

17:31.151 --> 17:34.586
Well, that's the easy part.
And then there's...

17:34.686 --> 17:37.097
It's just complicated.

17:38.457 --> 17:42.629
Well, I'm dating a guy
who's completely not right for me,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.827
and he wants to get serious, and I don't.

17:46.932 --> 17:50.077
And I came here tonight to see you...

17:53.672 --> 17:57.576
- But you're wearing a wedding ring.
- Yeah.

17:57.676 --> 18:00.832
And... you're happy?

18:06.285 --> 18:08.020
Right?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.531
Why do you ask?

18:12.524 --> 18:14.768
I should run.

18:15.327 --> 18:18.698
- No, no, no. Wait.
- No, I really... Please, this is a bad idea.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.001
I don't want to overstep. I don't want
to say something that I'm gonna regret.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.470
I don't even know what I was
thinking would happen tonight.

18:24.570 --> 18:29.442
- I feel really stupid. I just...
- Nothing is gonna happen. We're just...

18:29.842 --> 18:32.719
we're just gonna sit and talk. That's all.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.956
I don't think so, Ben.

18:40.485 --> 18:43.300
Hey, what's going on?

18:45.190 --> 18:46.960
It's a disaster.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.407
I feel like such a cliché.
I'm dating my boss.

18:50.507 --> 18:54.367
Technically he's everyone's boss.
He's the CEO of Pierson.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.768
You're dating Arthur Denning?

18:56.868 --> 18:58.204
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

18:58.304 --> 19:00.840
I was his head of sales.
I'm not a gold digger, you know.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.409
Arthur can be really charming
when he wants to be.

19:03.509 --> 19:07.346
Well, if your heart's not in it,
why don't you just leave him?

19:07.446 --> 19:09.716
He won't let me.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.785
- What do you mean, he won't let you?
- I mean he won't let me.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.488
It started with threats, you know,
implying I would lose my job.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.499
Is he hurting you?

19:20.259 --> 19:24.931
I was on his laptop, and I found data about
the clinical trials that went bad last summer.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.341
From Viprexalin.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.070
268 people died.

19:30.170 --> 19:34.741
You know what Arthur was concerned about?
How the deaths would affect his financials.

19:34.841 --> 19:37.384
Did he say that in the emails?

19:38.994 --> 19:43.824
Try to remember if he actually addressed
the deaths from Viprexalin in these emails.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.053
I'm not sure. I mean, maybe.

19:47.153 --> 19:51.824
- Where is this data? Do you still have it?
- Arthur would know that it came from me.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.328
Well, we can make it look
like it came from someone else.

19:55.428 --> 20:01.033
- Oh, rea... how?
- I can help you with this, okay?

20:01.533 --> 20:04.111
Now, do you want my help or not?

20:06.305 --> 20:08.882
Do you mind grabbing that for me?

20:11.877 --> 20:13.820
Thank you.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.485
Hey. Thought I heard you.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.322
I can't remember if I took
your Pinot Noir or Grigio from you.

20:22.422 --> 20:25.666
It's okay. I'm detoxing.

20:27.192 --> 20:30.270
- Hi.
- Hello, tall guy.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.600
Oh, I'm just here...
we're just friends, okay?

20:33.700 --> 20:36.868
I'm just here on business, you know.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.304
Okay.

20:38.404 --> 20:40.214
- Have fun, Hanna.
- Thanks.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.486
- Hanna?
- Yeah.

20:47.679 --> 20:50.416
Most nights I spend in an apartment
that Arthur bought for me,

20:50.516 --> 20:52.318
but here, I can escape all that.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.388
Here, I can be a regular girl
named Hanna Harlow,

20:55.488 --> 21:01.368
who reads trashy magazines and watches
reality TV and exists in sweats.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.305
Does your boyfriend know
that you own this place?

21:05.564 --> 21:09.566
- I'm only here when he's out of town.
- No, I can't stay.

21:10.452 --> 21:12.729
It's just a drink.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.896
Okay.

21:30.055 --> 21:34.427
Let's see. Escrows, bank transfers.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.864
Look at that.

21:38.164 --> 21:42.734
There are hundreds of millions
hidden in offshore bank accounts here.

21:42.834 --> 21:45.579
These are documented payoffs...

21:46.872 --> 21:51.544
that required a fingerprint I.D.
Denning validated all of these personally.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.546
Arthur made changes
to the internal lab results,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.648
because he knew the FDA
wouldn't approve them.

21:55.748 --> 21:59.157
You've definitely got the groundwork
for a gigantic civil lawsuit here,

21:59.257 --> 22:01.587
but I can't...

22:01.687 --> 22:03.855
I can't use this.

22:03.955 --> 22:09.012
Why not? You said we could make it
look like it came from someone else.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.106
What comes next is our secret.

22:14.533 --> 22:17.377
Denning finds out that you leaked this...

22:18.136 --> 22:20.414
you'll be exposed.

22:23.909 --> 22:26.353
Expose what you want.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.434
Unzip me.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.896
I didn't say you could touch.

23:46.792 --> 23:49.069
Oh, my God.

24:09.014 --> 24:11.024
Come here.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.754
Oh, my God. No.

24:14.854 --> 24:17.130
What are you waiting for?

24:19.391 --> 24:21.868
Don't you want to fuck me?

24:23.562 --> 24:26.039
Holy shit. I can't...

24:36.107 --> 24:38.318
I can't do it.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.590
I can't do it.

24:54.225 --> 24:56.070
Ben.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.766
Take the fire escape.

25:00.866 --> 25:04.144
Don't let my neighbor stop you.
She'll talk you to death.

25:08.206 --> 25:11.049
Or you can finish what you started.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.924
I can't.

26:28.887 --> 26:31.131
Have fun?

26:34.092 --> 26:36.603
You smell like vodka.

26:37.862 --> 26:41.107
Doug opened up one of his office bottles.

26:42.834 --> 26:47.205
We ended up working late, ate Thai.

26:47.305 --> 26:49.141
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:49.241 --> 26:53.446
- What did you have?
- Oh, noodles, spicy noodles.

26:53.546 --> 26:56.422
They weren't... they weren't great.

27:01.986 --> 27:06.832
Anyway, I think I'm gonna
go shower. I'm tired.

27:09.027 --> 27:11.571
Are you serious right now?

27:15.467 --> 27:18.178
Did you forget about date night?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.775
I wouldn't have been any fun anyway.

27:22.875 --> 27:24.977
I worked a double, so I'm a zombie.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.413
No, no, no, no. Let me
make this up to you this weekend.

27:28.513 --> 27:32.218
- You're off the hook.
- No, goddamn it. We need a night.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.468
You and me.

27:34.568 --> 27:37.708
We need to get back to normal, all right?

28:10.054 --> 28:13.066
- I'll join you upstairs.
- Thank you.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.865
Give us a minute.

28:19.965 --> 28:23.235
The information against
Arthur Denning you gave me, is it legit?

28:23.335 --> 28:27.840
Because if you're wrong, you'll be doing
document review for the rest of your career.

28:30.575 --> 28:33.079
Abrams' office, five minutes.
Brief him on what you have.

28:33.179 --> 28:36.522
Keep it short. Do not fuck up.

28:38.883 --> 28:42.922
Senior partner just threatened you.
You're moving up.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.825
Wait, so you have information
against Arthur Denning,

28:45.925 --> 28:48.060
like, the Arthur Denning?

28:48.160 --> 28:50.062
You don't fuck with a guy like him.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.665
He and Mr. Abrams are at war,
so tread lightly.

28:52.765 --> 28:55.041
I'll fill you in later.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.908
Hope you have your affairs in order.

29:12.016 --> 29:15.521
- Mr. Abrams.
- Mr. Cahill. Come on in.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.899
Have a seat.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.866
So, Hill tells me you have something.

29:26.966 --> 29:30.343
Yeah, with Pierson Pharmaceuticals.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.271
You're not serious, are you?

29:32.371 --> 29:37.104
We go way back with them, you know,
so that's like pissing in the wind, son.

29:37.204 --> 29:38.770
You know, I...

29:39.010 --> 29:41.380
You've gone after Arthur Denning before,

29:41.480 --> 29:44.550
and it was one of the only cases
that this firm ever lost.

29:44.650 --> 29:49.596
Now, I have studied every word
of every motion filed and...

29:50.905 --> 29:51.993
Well, with all due respect,

29:52.093 --> 29:55.727
I don't think that you played
your cards quite right last time.

29:56.227 --> 29:58.230
Oh, you don't?

29:58.330 --> 30:03.202
Look, Denning's team forged expert reports
that allowed him to slip by FDA approval.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.572
They knowingly changed the observation
and conclusions of these drug trials.

30:06.672 --> 30:10.299
- Take a look at this. There were...
- These are facts I know.

30:10.399 --> 30:13.813
- I know about this stuff. Come on.
- Serious health defects, 268...

30:13.913 --> 30:16.682
But you're not telling me
how you're gonna win this time.

30:16.782 --> 30:18.533
That's what I want to hear.

30:18.883 --> 30:21.294
Well, I've got...

30:23.121 --> 30:28.626
Confidential internal memos that will
back up everything inside that folder.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.673
Well, that's a neat little thing.

30:34.198 --> 30:36.102
Well, just keep talking. Go ahead.

30:36.202 --> 30:39.492
Pierson is a global corporation
with an infantry of lawyers,

30:39.592 --> 30:41.670
but with this...

30:41.770 --> 30:44.243
we can go after Denning
personally for fraud.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.879
Now, you thought this through?

30:46.979 --> 30:50.582
If you're gonna go after Denning
for fraud publicly,

30:50.682 --> 30:54.987
a man worth about 8.5 billion dollars?

30:55.087 --> 30:59.290
And you're gonna accuse this man
of manipulating drug trials?

30:59.390 --> 31:03.468
- In a lawsuit, yes.
- A lawsuit's public, Mr. Cahill.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.673
You have kids?

31:09.934 --> 31:11.670
No.

31:11.770 --> 31:16.809
- Where'd you go to law school?
- Vandy. Undergrad at Tennessee.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.934
That's good. So how much you worth?

31:20.611 --> 31:22.614
- How much am I worth?
- Yeah.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.950
Your life, how much is your life worth?

31:25.050 --> 31:28.987
Why don't you just jot down
the dollar amount here?

31:29.087 --> 31:32.693
- Do you have any idea?
- It ain't much, but...

31:34.359 --> 31:38.264
See the pen?
That's a Valenti, one of the first.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.716
That thing costs about $68,000.

31:41.816 --> 31:44.302
68,000 dollars?

31:44.402 --> 31:46.172
You didn't know that, did you?

31:46.272 --> 31:49.693
So how am I gonna know
your worth unless you tell me?

31:52.777 --> 31:55.113
I'm worth this case.

31:55.213 --> 31:58.424
You know why that's worth 68 grand?

31:59.017 --> 32:03.322
Because it has a reputation.
It has a name brand. It has an identity.

32:03.422 --> 32:08.160
We get a case like this,
a litigation at this level,

32:08.260 --> 32:11.137
I need lawyers who kill.

32:11.562 --> 32:17.711
Lawyers with reputations walk
into a courtroom and intimidate.

32:18.569 --> 32:22.116
I don't see you
in that picture, Mr. Cahill.

32:24.142 --> 32:26.463
Mr. Abrams...

32:26.563 --> 32:30.816
I fight to win. Some of your
other senior partners like Hill,

32:30.916 --> 32:34.186
they're a little soft,
they work within limits.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.489
You need someone
who isn't afraid of the wrong thing...

32:38.589 --> 32:40.266
for the right reasons.

32:41.726 --> 32:43.770
That's you?

32:45.330 --> 32:47.172
You take it all. You give it to Hill.

32:47.272 --> 32:52.105
Let him look at it, and I think
you could lead a support team.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.584
Leader of the support team?

33:02.213 --> 33:04.290
Yes, sir.

33:10.521 --> 33:12.825
You know what? No.

33:12.925 --> 33:15.427
No, that's just trumped up
paralegal bullshit.

33:15.527 --> 33:19.654
I've done my time making copies.
I want Denning.

33:19.754 --> 33:24.342
I want to be the handler, and I want
the goddamn generator fee for bringing it in.

33:26.537 --> 33:28.781
Sit down.

33:37.381 --> 33:39.659
Understand this.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.451
You get a nine figure judgment,

33:44.551 --> 33:46.915
or get a new job.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.797
Done. Done.

33:52.097 --> 33:54.207
Mr. Cahill.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.939
- Enjoy the pen.
- You're gonna let me keep the pen?

34:00.039 --> 34:02.949
You better go before I change my mind.

34:06.644 --> 34:08.981
I want to find out who exactly
Denning's legal team is.

34:09.081 --> 34:11.449
Let's dig in, find out
everything we can about them.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.386
How far back? Three years? Five maybe?

34:14.485 --> 34:17.522
- A decade's worth.
- Fuck.

34:17.822 --> 34:18.924
Copy that.

34:19.024 --> 34:22.328
Why do we use so much paper? I mean,
do we really need to print out this much?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.263
Electronic copies can be tampered with.

34:24.362 --> 34:28.100
Until the courts figure that nonsense out,
this firm uses paper.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.868
We depose Denning in two days.

34:29.967 --> 34:32.438
This is three weeks' worth
of research to comb through.

34:32.538 --> 34:36.523
You... need a strategy.
If I may make a suggestion...

34:36.623 --> 34:38.942
We're good. Thank you.

34:39.042 --> 34:42.922
Do you mind asking Hatty to bring in
some dinner menus, please?

34:43.648 --> 34:46.324
You were on your way out, right?

34:47.518 --> 34:49.254
I'll fetch her for you.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.857
All right.
Let's start with some cataloging.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.960
This is the subpoenaed bank records.

34:55.060 --> 35:00.165
Cross-reference his offshore accounts
with his tax returns, please.

35:00.665 --> 35:02.942
You got a minute?

35:03.201 --> 35:06.855
- Yeah, I'm all ears.
- In private?

35:09.073 --> 35:11.276
What's going on, Doug?

35:11.376 --> 35:14.845
So I was doing background checks
on this Denning discovery.

35:14.945 --> 35:17.515
Guess whose name I caught.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.385
Emily Hynes. Yeah.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.856
Only took me two days
and a lexisnexis account to find that.

35:23.956 --> 35:28.000
Yeah, well, Arthur Denning
has a lot of people working for him.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.296
Yeah.

35:30.696 --> 35:33.832
So your shady ex-girlfriend
just shows up out of the blue,

35:33.932 --> 35:37.843
right around the same time you find
evidence on her billionaire boyfriend?

35:41.039 --> 35:43.809
- Is this what I think it is?
- What are you asking me?

35:43.909 --> 35:46.378
- Did you get this evidence from Emily?
- Emily has nothing to do with it.

35:46.478 --> 35:47.713
- Then where did you get this?
- Why?

35:47.813 --> 35:50.823
'Cause I think she fed it to you
for whatever reason.

35:50.948 --> 35:54.227
No. No, Doug.

35:56.687 --> 35:59.469
Fruit of the poisonous tree.
You taught me that.

36:00.992 --> 36:04.296
Okay, we are under compulsory
evidence origin disclosure order.

36:04.396 --> 36:08.208
Okay, in a case this massive,
all evidence has to be obtained legally.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.371
Look, if I caught this trail,
others will, too.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.707
Okay, you gotta get your shit in order.
Just listen to me. Listen to me.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.109
The entire case rests on this.

36:17.209 --> 36:20.953
We have a case here,
and we're gonna win it.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.649
Yeah, well, you are playing with fire.

36:23.749 --> 36:26.032
I don't know what's going on
between you two, but you gotta stop it.

36:26.132 --> 36:29.562
- You gotta get her out of town.
- Okay, Doug. That'll be all. Thank you.

36:48.038 --> 36:51.250
Hello. You live here?

36:51.976 --> 36:53.853
No.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.256
Why?

37:01.652 --> 37:03.929
Do you know her?

37:05.223 --> 37:07.033
No.

37:10.394 --> 37:14.144
You lied to me twice. Take another look.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.438
Are you a cop?

37:19.538 --> 37:22.548
Do you know her or the man she's dating?

37:23.207 --> 37:25.684
Who the fuck are you?

37:27.211 --> 37:29.622
You've never seen her before?

37:31.015 --> 37:32.818
No.

37:33.118 --> 37:36.038
But I have seen you creeping around
here at night and if it happens again,

37:36.138 --> 37:38.897
I'm calling the actual cops.

37:43.394 --> 37:45.738
Have a good night.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.241
- There you go.
- A bottle of Gaia?

37:56.341 --> 37:59.979
That's right. 350 bucks a bottle.

38:00.279 --> 38:03.481
That hurt, when you took
that gunshot wound to the chest?

38:03.581 --> 38:05.891
Oh, my God.

38:23.501 --> 38:27.372
Look, let's... No cooking tonight, okay?

38:27.472 --> 38:30.950
Let's go out and celebrate
properly, you and me.

38:34.245 --> 38:38.324
- Can I change?
- Nah. I think you should wear that.

38:38.749 --> 38:40.826
Move.

39:11.749 --> 39:14.319
This is not how I remember it!

39:14.819 --> 39:18.190
- You want to go someplace else?
- I can barely hear anything you're saying.

39:18.290 --> 39:21.367
Okay, I'm gonna go get some drinks.
I'll be right back.

39:32.303 --> 39:35.105
Two vodka sodas, please. Thank you.

39:35.205 --> 39:37.050
Hello.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.284
Do I know you?

39:45.384 --> 39:48.894
Don't ask a question
you already know the answer to.

39:49.787 --> 39:51.631
Okay.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.062
You have a good night.

39:57.162 --> 39:59.296
You made an enemy you don't want.

39:59.396 --> 40:01.540
Is that right?

40:03.834 --> 40:08.147
Why don't you tell Arthur Denning that
this is some real amateur-hour bullshit.

40:11.475 --> 40:12.911
What do you want?

40:13.011 --> 40:16.188
- For you to drop this case.
- I'm not dropping this case.

40:17.681 --> 40:21.728
You will recuse yourself
and resign from your firm.

40:23.354 --> 40:24.843
And if I don't?

40:24.943 --> 40:28.934
Your wife will never look
this happy again.

40:29.710 --> 40:31.920
Have fun.

40:40.971 --> 40:42.782
Hey.

40:45.509 --> 40:48.319
- Sorry it took so long.
- That's okay. I made a friend.

40:48.419 --> 40:50.214
Yeah?

40:50.314 --> 40:55.487
Benjamin Cahill. How long has it been?
Like, ten years, I think.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.379
Hi.

40:58.088 --> 41:00.091
I was just getting cozy with your wife.

41:00.191 --> 41:04.095
Yes, she said that she recognized me
from your profile picture.

41:04.195 --> 41:07.262
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah, it's crazy.

41:07.362 --> 41:10.335
Emily said that you guys met
freshman year at Tennessee?

41:10.435 --> 41:12.537
- Yeah.
- We dated, actually.

41:12.637 --> 41:15.914
But I think Ben got over me since then.

41:17.841 --> 41:20.345
- So are you here by yourself?
- No, girls' night out.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.313
You know, drinking and dancing and...

41:22.413 --> 41:25.717
speaking of which,
I should probably go find them.

41:25.817 --> 41:28.119
Okay. Well, it was nice to see you.

41:28.219 --> 41:31.923
- It was lovely meeting you.
- You, too. You smell so nice.

41:32.023 --> 41:35.861
- Oh, thank you. Ben?
- Okay.

41:35.961 --> 41:39.398
Don't ever ignore my phone calls
or I'll tell her what happened.

41:39.498 --> 41:42.207
- It was nice to see you, Emily.
- Bye.

41:48.606 --> 41:50.975
I didn't know that was your type.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.319
That's not my type.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.289
Charlotte... you're my type.

41:58.749 --> 42:01.327
She wears a lot of perfume.

42:04.655 --> 42:08.267
- You gonna ask a girl to dance?
- Okay. Come on.

42:28.445 --> 42:32.324
- Thank you.
- Yeah. What's going on?

42:42.993 --> 42:45.604
Why did you never mention Emily?

42:48.232 --> 42:52.077
When we talked about your ex-girlfriends,
you never brought her up.

42:59.476 --> 43:04.015
We never talk about
anything really, I mean...

43:04.115 --> 43:07.126
- especially since the...
- The baby?

43:09.587 --> 43:10.989
Yeah.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.758
The night I lost the baby,
I was sitting right here, remember,

43:13.858 --> 43:16.368
and I was curled up in a little ball?

43:18.996 --> 43:22.033
The pain was really unbearable that night.

43:22.333 --> 43:26.178
And you came, and you knelt
and you looked at me, and you said...

43:27.738 --> 43:30.282
that we needed to be brave...

43:32.509 --> 43:35.588
and that from now on, it's just us.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.559
I'll never forget that.

43:41.018 --> 43:45.771
You made a promise that we
would be okay and it was just us.

43:51.795 --> 43:54.932
Yeah, but we never talked
about the baby after that.

43:55.032 --> 43:57.276
I know, Ben.

43:58.736 --> 44:01.380
We didn't have to until now.

45:19.016 --> 45:20.826
Again.

45:28.959 --> 45:30.890
- Harder!
- What the fuck?

45:30.990 --> 45:33.064
This is getting a little crazy.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.866
I thought you said
you get off on violence.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.977
Am I gonna have to hit myself
or are you gonna fucking do it?

45:48.545 --> 45:52.984
Your ad said you liked it rough.
This just feels wrong.

45:53.584 --> 45:56.120
Can I send these to myself?

45:56.820 --> 46:00.424
No. These are for me...

46:00.524 --> 46:02.802
to remember you by.

46:08.532 --> 46:09.668
Get off me.

46:09.768 --> 46:12.370
I thought you said
we were just getting started.

46:12.470 --> 46:14.446
I want you to leave.

46:15.372 --> 46:19.984
Now, before I call the cops
and show them how bad you beat me.

46:21.478 --> 46:23.822
You're out of your mind.

46:39.329 --> 46:41.165
Fuck.

46:41.265 --> 46:43.442
Get it together.

46:50.007 --> 46:54.412
<i>Sir, this is Dr. Kroeher. I can understand
what you must be going through.</i>

46:54.512 --> 46:58.449
<i>It's a lot to handle,
but I can tell you this.</i>

46:58.549 --> 47:02.461
<i>You won't survive another day
without coming in.</i>

47:02.853 --> 47:06.890
<i>Doesn't matter if it's this hospital or not.
You need medical attention.</i>

47:06.990 --> 47:09.101
<i>Is that clear?</i>

47:33.650 --> 47:36.187
You're gonna sit here all night, bro?

47:36.287 --> 47:39.490
Yeah, bro. You old enough to work here?

47:39.590 --> 47:42.400
You old enough to mind your own business?

47:43.477 --> 47:45.630
Hey, Anthony.

47:45.730 --> 47:48.533
How about one of them cream sodas
you're so famous for?

47:48.633 --> 47:51.502
Don't get up. Sit down.
I come here all the time.

47:52.002 --> 47:54.239
- How's it going?
- It's all right. How you doing?

47:54.339 --> 47:56.761
What's this?

47:58.208 --> 48:01.001
- Glad you're putting it to use.
- Well, I'm trying.

48:01.101 --> 48:04.173
Yeah. So how we doing?

48:04.273 --> 48:08.068
Well... Firm's got a solid case,
no question.

48:08.168 --> 48:10.939
Solid. But?

48:11.489 --> 48:14.068
But Denning's lawyers

48:14.168 --> 48:18.896
waited till last night to file a motion
to keep those internal docs out.

48:18.996 --> 48:21.499
So you got a work around, do you?

48:21.599 --> 48:24.469
No. No, not yet,
but I'm not gonna sleep until I do.

48:24.569 --> 48:27.091
Well, you know,
this isn't about effort anyway.

48:27.971 --> 48:30.374
It's about Denning.

48:30.474 --> 48:35.120
You poked the bear.
Now he's restless and ready to come.

48:35.979 --> 48:38.583
- So what would you do?
- I don't know.

48:38.683 --> 48:42.420
Probably... call you.

48:42.520 --> 48:48.123
You know, here's someone like you
been through so much, a major tragedy,

48:49.109 --> 48:51.164
unthinkable...

48:51.628 --> 48:55.382
but you come out the other side.
Many people wouldn't have made it.

48:55.482 --> 49:00.218
You did. I knew that about you.
I knew it before you came into my office.

49:00.538 --> 49:03.548
I might have not let you in otherwise.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.478
Wait a second. So...

49:07.578 --> 49:11.629
Hill giving me that meeting with you,
that was just some kind of a setup or what?

49:11.729 --> 49:16.019
Setup? Come on. You're a public
defender, or you were one.

49:16.119 --> 49:18.757
- Yeah.
- The hardest thing for a public defender

49:18.857 --> 49:22.627
is whether or not he or she
is gonna make a dent of difference.

49:22.727 --> 49:26.998
- Now, you did, every time.
- Feel like I'm a little bit in over my head.

49:27.098 --> 49:30.201
No, you're not. Hey, let me tell you
the worst vice is advice.

49:30.301 --> 49:32.602
I just been giving it to you.

49:32.702 --> 49:38.176
Son, listen to me. You gotta shed
this distraction you're in now,

49:38.276 --> 49:42.914
what's bothering you. Don't tell me.
Just shed it. You understand?

49:43.014 --> 49:45.627
We're gonna have
to attack this motherfucker...

49:46.067 --> 49:48.319
clip his claws.

49:48.419 --> 49:52.523
Take his head,
and chop that fucking thing off.

49:52.623 --> 49:55.158
We'll put it on the wall.

49:55.258 --> 49:57.160
A trophy.

49:57.260 --> 49:59.137
Okay.

50:03.433 --> 50:05.403
- Okay. Now we're talking.
- All right. All right.

50:05.503 --> 50:08.706
Call me anytime. And Anthony...

50:08.806 --> 50:13.485
forget the cream soda once again?
See that? I knew you did.

50:13.585 --> 50:16.581
You shed whatever's distracting you,
you'll be okay.

50:16.681 --> 50:18.957
Good seeing you, son.

50:49.913 --> 50:51.557
Hey.

50:59.856 --> 51:02.401
Oh, I don't know what...

51:04.761 --> 51:06.574
Okay.

51:37.861 --> 51:39.671
What?

51:52.042 --> 51:55.080
Wait. Wait.

51:57.347 --> 51:59.925
No. No.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.339
Oh, my God...

52:21.439 --> 52:23.782
What the fuck am I gonna do?

52:28.111 --> 52:31.649
- Jesus Christ.
- Oh, I'm so... I'm sorry.

52:31.749 --> 52:34.970
Sorry. I was just gonna say what's up
to Hanna, and have some wine.

52:35.070 --> 52:38.705
Yeah, she's not here right now.
She's supposed to be back later on.

52:39.055 --> 52:42.066
- Okay, cool.
- I left my...

52:42.425 --> 52:45.382
- my cellphone here last night.
- Cool.

52:45.562 --> 52:47.431
Yeah.

52:47.731 --> 52:50.668
I have a small confession to make.

52:50.768 --> 52:54.646
I'm married and she's got
a boyfriend who isn't me.

52:55.505 --> 52:56.949
So...

52:58.742 --> 53:02.145
So I never saw you,
and we never had this conversation.

53:02.495 --> 53:05.607
- All good.
- I would appreciate that.

53:05.783 --> 53:08.260
All right. I'll see you later.

53:25.069 --> 53:26.870
Hey!

53:27.270 --> 53:29.514
Is that you?

53:31.608 --> 53:33.786
What's wrong?

53:36.546 --> 53:38.882
We need to talk.

53:38.982 --> 53:41.059
What is it?

53:44.421 --> 53:46.665
I screwed up.

53:49.860 --> 53:54.172
I got mixed up in something
that I shouldn't have and...

53:59.986 --> 54:02.230
Did you fuck her?

54:04.374 --> 54:06.651
How did she die?

54:08.211 --> 54:11.022
I don't know. Pills, I think.

54:11.581 --> 54:14.192
It looks like she hit her head.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.091
We worked so hard, Ben. You know,
and we just started to get ahead,

54:20.191 --> 54:23.044
and then you throw it away to get involved
with an ex-girlfriend for a fucking case?

54:23.144 --> 54:26.397
- I was doing this for us.
- Don't say that! That is insulting!

54:26.497 --> 54:28.499
That's so insulting to me and my marriage!

54:28.599 --> 54:31.586
There were other ways you
could've landed a case! You know that.

54:31.686 --> 54:36.460
When I go out and I work a double shift,
that is for us! This was for you!

54:41.778 --> 54:43.347
What do you think, baby?
What do you think?

54:43.447 --> 54:46.250
You think if you, like,
land partner and you win a case,

54:46.350 --> 54:49.427
that I'd feel differently
about you? Because...

54:49.986 --> 54:52.623
I love you. I love you, rich or poor.

54:52.723 --> 54:54.966
I love you, too.

54:55.492 --> 54:58.303
I love you too, and I'm so sorry for this.

55:01.598 --> 55:04.609
There was a text message.

55:05.068 --> 55:08.613
It mentioned a meeting
at an art gallery at...

55:09.539 --> 55:13.373
Maybe I could go over there and see
if I can try to piece this thing together.

55:13.473 --> 55:16.981
- It's the only lead I got.
- And what if it doesn't lead anywhere?

55:17.081 --> 55:19.750
In the next few days,
they're gonna find Emily's body.

55:19.850 --> 55:23.561
The police are gonna get involved
and I'll have to admit everything.

55:25.088 --> 55:27.699
So what do we do until then?

55:29.225 --> 55:31.985
We act as normal as possible.

55:32.385 --> 55:35.266
Okay? You go to work. I go to work.

55:35.566 --> 55:39.911
Until I can figure something out,
we'll just leave her there.

55:51.781 --> 55:53.718
Do you want some coffee?

55:53.818 --> 55:57.128
Yeah. That'd be nice.

56:04.594 --> 56:06.760
She remind you of someone you know?

56:06.860 --> 56:10.647
- Yeah.
- Like most women, she's expensive.

57:00.984 --> 57:03.628
Just a word. I just...

57:18.935 --> 57:21.339
What the fuck happened back there?

57:21.439 --> 57:24.475
Oh, this gentleman approached me,
said things as if he were the kidnapper.

57:24.575 --> 57:26.510
I didn't want to chance it,
so I took action.

57:26.610 --> 57:30.915
- That kidnapper was an art dealer.
- Yeah, I know that now. I'm aware of that.

57:31.015 --> 57:35.820
But you know, he's getting medical attention
and compensation for his inconvenience.

57:35.920 --> 57:39.123
Compensation? Are you fucking kidding me?
She could be dead because of you!

57:39.223 --> 57:41.299
Jane, stop!

57:45.494 --> 57:50.333
The kidnappers weren't there. If they were,
they had no intention of approaching me,

57:50.454 --> 57:54.104
and time is precious. I don't think
these guys would waste it, do you?

57:54.204 --> 57:58.976
And... it could have been a ruse
or a trick. I don't know, but...

57:59.076 --> 58:02.613
as always, in matters like this,
I'll take things into my own hands.

58:02.713 --> 58:06.684
My actions may appear
somewhat rash or foolish,

58:06.784 --> 58:09.727
but I did what I believed was right.

58:10.253 --> 58:14.057
So this now is the situation
we find ourselves in.

58:14.157 --> 58:17.595
I want Emily back,
and I want her back, now.

58:17.695 --> 58:21.435
So how are we going to accomplish this,
Joe? Can you enlighten me?

58:24.768 --> 58:29.407
No, Giffords, I can't tell you why. I just
need you to hack Emily Hyne's profile,

58:29.507 --> 58:32.660
and erase any communication
between the two of us, okay?

58:32.760 --> 58:36.351
- Yeah, I understand but it's not possible.
- What do you mean it's not possible?

58:36.451 --> 58:39.784
- You hacked Visa, for God's sakes.
- Yeah, I can hack anyone, okay?

58:39.884 --> 58:41.485
But your talks with her are all online,

58:41.585 --> 58:44.722
which means that your chats are broken up
into 10,000 little bytes and pieces.

58:44.822 --> 58:47.258
<i>I can't erase all that.
Delete the messages on your end.</i>

58:47.358 --> 58:51.085
<i>I'll ghost her account and try
and work out the rest, okay?</i>

58:59.569 --> 59:03.948
Are you serious right now?
Everyone's waiting for you.

59:10.046 --> 59:12.625
- Ben!
- Yeah, all right.

59:43.179 --> 59:45.457
Who is this?

59:46.182 --> 59:48.693
<i>Why did you answer?</i>

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:25.663
Mr. Denning, what happened?
Where's your troop?

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:29.026
I was expecting an army.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:33.037
Well, your expectations have often
been your downfall, Charles.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:37.935
Well, I'd rather have faulty expectations

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:41.171
than sell faulty pharmaceuticals.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.724
But then again, that's just me.

01:00:43.824 --> 01:00:47.027
Let the record reflect
that we have filed a civil suit

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:49.480
on behalf of the named plaintiffs

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:52.716
against Arthur Denning
of Pierson Pharmaceuticals.

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:55.653
Let's begin by confirming
your identity for the record.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:59.123
Your name is legally Arthur Denning?

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:10.041
- Would you like him to repeat the question?
- I'd prefer if we spoke off the record.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.238
Okay.

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:20.257
New events have come to light
that change the nature of this allegation.

01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:22.580
Such as?

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:28.092
Well, I could elaborate,
but I would prefer if Mr. Cahill did.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:35.066
It's curious, isn't it,
that she was drawn to us both?

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:39.470
What the hell you talking about?

01:01:39.929 --> 01:01:41.932
What is this?

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:46.471
I understand you're in possession of files
that were illegally stolen from my computer.

01:01:50.439 --> 01:01:53.309
Everything was obtained legally

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:55.920
and submitted to you in discovery.

01:01:56.779 --> 01:02:00.024
Really? Everything?

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.719
Everything.

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:06.397
The woman who brought
that evidence to you...

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.200
where is she now?

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:17.108
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.237
You know you're cornered, Arthur.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:24.448
Answer the questions... on the record.

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:27.777
I haven't been able
to reach her, have you?

01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:29.721
No?

01:02:30.479 --> 01:02:33.384
Charles, I am prepared to settle

01:02:33.484 --> 01:02:36.700
the class-action certification right now.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.857
- Mr. Denning, is that...
- You're admitting fault?

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.892
$300 million to the class members.

01:02:41.992 --> 01:02:44.862
One third will take care
of your attorney fees,

01:02:44.962 --> 01:02:49.032
and within 24 hours, the $400 million
will be wired to your trust account.

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:52.002
Okay. We're gonna need
both sides to agree on this

01:02:52.102 --> 01:02:55.372
and have the judge sign
for the class settlement.

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:59.844
Oh, in this town, I think you'll find
a judge that will be able to do that.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:06.483
- I don't understand why you're doing this.
- 'Cause we got something he wants.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.087
Yeah, in exchange for a settlement,

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.556
we sign a confidentiality,

01:03:12.656 --> 01:03:16.593
then we return the evidence
to Mr. Denning,

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:21.506
including the files
that were "hypothetically..."

01:03:22.531 --> 01:03:24.534
taken from his computer.

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:28.680
No risk of criminal prosecution.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.716
Then we're done.

01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:33.885
<i>Ciao.</i>

01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:42.019
Did he just buy back the evidence?

01:03:42.119 --> 01:03:45.897
Yes, he did, and he did it legally.

01:03:50.293 --> 01:03:54.230
At least you're rich. Live with that.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.124
Congratulations.

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:06.576
Aside from the suicide attempt
a few years ago,

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.580
did Emily seem relatively stable?

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:14.348
Yeah, I guess so. Seemed okay.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:18.696
Did you two have sex regularly?

01:04:19.688 --> 01:04:21.933
How is that relevant?

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:25.630
Well, she's still missing,
so everything is.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.665
She mixed quite a cocktail for herself.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:32.569
Oxy, Rits, Vics, Ads, uptake inhibitors,

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:35.539
and a whole lot of colors
I have never seen before.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.041
So what are you getting at?

01:04:37.141 --> 01:04:41.311
She either spontaneously developed
every mental disorder on the planet,

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:45.234
or something in her life, maybe someone,

01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:47.925
was scaring her.

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:51.155
Yeah, I know what you're getting at.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:56.060
I own a pharmaceutical company,
but I didn't prescribe those, okay?

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:59.603
So why aren't you out there
looking for her?

01:05:00.679 --> 01:05:04.859
I've got to be honest here. It doesn't
seem like you even care if we find her.

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:09.957
After 48 hours, the chances of
recovering her are increasingly difficult.

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:14.378
Emily can be difficult and I love her.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:19.123
If anything, her being difficult
is the thing I love most.

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:22.493
Weird, isn't it?

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:35.465
<i>You've reached Charlotte.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:39.194
Hey, honey, it's me. Give me a call.

01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:02.634
Emily?

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.344
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:06:21.444 --> 01:06:23.499
Oh, shit.

01:06:40.697 --> 01:06:43.174
Police! Open the door!

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:50.272
This is the New Orleans Police Department!
We have a warrant to search your home!

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:53.050
You have 30 seconds to come out!

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.294
Clear!

01:07:38.254 --> 01:07:39.997
Clear.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:43.300
We have a dead body in here!

01:07:45.928 --> 01:07:47.739
Clear.

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.923
Clear.

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:37.888
Fuck.

01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:16.361
You didn't do it, right?

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.322
No, I didn't do it.

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.157
I gotta ask the question, man. I'm sorry.

01:09:22.256 --> 01:09:26.529
- Jesus Christ.
- I told you not to get involved with her.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:29.066
- You knew Emily was crazy.
- I know! I know!

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:33.176
I should have listened to you.
All right? It was stupid.

01:09:37.538 --> 01:09:41.676
If the cops catch you with this, they're
gonna shoot first, ask questions later.

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:44.613
Just get the fuck outta here with that.

01:09:44.712 --> 01:09:48.971
- Thank you. You're a good friend.
- I know. I know. I know.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:54.377
Fucking dumb friend,
that's what I am. Jesus.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:15.045
I just spent three hours with detectives.

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:19.282
I don't know if there's anything
more I can say.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:21.651
We just have a few more questions.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:24.654
Did your husband ever mention
Emily Hynes before?

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:28.091
I'm sorry. Who exactly are you?
I'm her attorney.

01:10:28.191 --> 01:10:32.970
Joe Bilson. My associate,
Jane Clemente, kidnap and rescue.

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.132
So you're not cops?

01:10:35.232 --> 01:10:37.134
We're privately contracted
by Arthur Denning...

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:38.735
She has no comment,

01:10:38.835 --> 01:10:42.313
and you have no place being here,
so I suggest you leave.

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.876
You do realize the woman
discovered dead in this house

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:50.354
was a woman her husband
was having an affair with?

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.985
Mr. Denning is willing to offer
aid in her legal expenses

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:59.162
if she's willing to help us find him.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:05.694
This is a manhunt,
and he is a fugitive at large.

01:11:05.994 --> 01:11:08.165
You're not gonna touch her.

01:11:08.265 --> 01:11:10.633
We spoke with Emily's neighbor.
What was her name?

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.202
Amy Campbell.

01:11:12.302 --> 01:11:16.973
Seems Ms. Campbell saw Ben
at Emily's loft on numerous occasions.

01:11:17.073 --> 01:11:21.991
Ms. Cahill, you may think you have
the complete picture, but you don't.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:26.582
Guys, I can file a motion if you need me to,
or I can just tell you right now.

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.718
Fuck off.

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:31.695
If you change your mind, you call us?

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:02.819
Yeah, the cops keep circling my house.
It's freaking me out.

01:12:02.919 --> 01:12:05.329
Can I come stay with you tonight?

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:09.292
Yeah. Yeah, it's my neighbor Hanna.

01:12:09.392 --> 01:12:13.195
Or whatever her name was. They still
haven't figured out what happened to her.

01:12:14.796 --> 01:12:18.635
Yeah, I don't know. It's freaking me out.
I don't want to stay here tonight. Just...

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:20.778
No!

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:25.816
Oh, my God.

01:12:37.085 --> 01:12:38.922
Help me!

01:12:52.152 --> 01:12:54.309
Help me! Help!

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.850
No.

01:13:11.119 --> 01:13:15.090
Do you have any idea
of what's happening here?

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:18.594
The entire city is hunting for this guy!

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:22.840
We find him first before the cops do.

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:32.082
You know what he's got
and what he could use it for.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:37.354
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch this settlement fall apart!

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:43.683
If we don't find him,
lot of people are gonna get hurt.

01:13:43.783 --> 01:13:47.798
Understand? Understand?

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.161
<i>Incoming!</i>

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:52.796
- Incoming!
- Incoming!

01:13:52.896 --> 01:13:56.166
26-year-old female.
Multiple trauma, skull fracture.

01:13:56.266 --> 01:13:58.968
- Maybe her clavicle is broken, too.
- Moving to trauma two!

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:02.859
- Need 100% oxygen!
- 125 milligrams of solu-medrol, I.V. push.

01:14:02.959 --> 01:14:04.941
How long's she been down?
I need an answer!

01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:06.343
- I'm not sure.
- She got a name?

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.211
- Amy Campbell.
- What? What happened to her?

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:09.979
I'm sorry I didn't clean her up better.

01:14:10.079 --> 01:14:12.582
Amy, I need you to lay down.
You've had an accident.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:14.851
- Do you remember what happened to you?
- Honey, lay down.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.953
Did you see what happened?
Did you see the person that did this?

01:14:17.053 --> 01:14:20.463
- Were you beaten?
- Hey! Step back!

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:38.032
Are you okay?

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:41.344
I'm okay.

01:14:41.444 --> 01:14:44.588
<i>I thought that I could handle this, Ben...</i>

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:50.327
But I can't.

01:14:51.553 --> 01:14:53.831
I just can't.

01:14:58.026 --> 01:15:01.572
It's just you and me. It's just us.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.903
<i>Are you sure</i>

01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:09.506
that that girl that they brought
into the ICU is Emily's neighbor?

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.696
<i>Her name is Amy Campbell</i>

01:15:11.796 --> 01:15:15.585
<i>and somebody has massacred her, Ben.</i>

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.556
Someone who knows what we did.

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:26.897
She saw me at Emily's place.
She can I.D. me.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:32.447
As terrible as it sounds,
she can't wake up until I fix this.

01:15:38.033 --> 01:15:41.780
- All right, baby, I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:56.620
I'm sorry.

01:16:58.413 --> 01:17:00.691
I'm sorry.

01:17:33.465 --> 01:17:38.278
What the fuck? What? Dr. Hughes!
Dr. Hughes! Room two!

01:17:39.104 --> 01:17:42.759
- I don't know what happened.
- She's coding. Get the crash cart! Go. Go.

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:45.002
I'll get the bags!

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:52.501
Come on. Don't die on me.
Come on. Stay with me.

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:07.585
Can I help you with something?

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:29.055
Next time, you should phone me
before you come here.

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:34.437
Article 7-14 of the standard
practice of code of ethics

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:38.381
says we may not talk off the record.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:43.179
All right, here's what's gonna go down.
We're gonna settle.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.081
I'm gonna give you everything that I got,

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:49.085
all the evidence that we got
against you, legal, illegal.

01:19:49.185 --> 01:19:54.224
And the manner in which you were able
to cover up all the shit that you've done.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:58.261
I'd love to help you
but there's just one small problem.

01:19:58.361 --> 01:20:00.129
Yeah? What's that?

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:03.366
I don't have the faintest fucking clue
what you're talking about.

01:20:03.466 --> 01:20:05.201
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:07.911
Emily was gonna extort you

01:20:08.011 --> 01:20:10.425
and you found out
and you got your feelings hurt,

01:20:10.525 --> 01:20:13.842
so you killed her
and then you framed me for it.

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:16.879
Well, I did not kill Emily,

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:20.182
although I can tell by the conviction
in your voice you think I did.

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:23.059
You know, I just realized something.

01:20:23.919 --> 01:20:25.750
It's so funny.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:29.603
Emily kidnapped herself, didn't she?
Of course.

01:20:29.703 --> 01:20:32.395
I mean, in retrospect,
it makes total sense, doesn't it?

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:35.732
Of course, when you love someone,
you tend to overlook the obvious,

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:38.068
but that's it.

01:20:38.168 --> 01:20:40.288
Poor old Emily.

01:20:40.388 --> 01:20:45.015
She was testing me to see
if I would bring the money for her.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.711
But she didn't live long enough
to see what I would do.

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:54.291
Pity. Kind of sad
that she involved you, too.

01:20:56.818 --> 01:21:01.590
So why did you send that guy
to come intimidate me at the club?

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:07.396
Oh, come on.
I have a net worth of $8.7 billion.

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:12.442
Do I look like a man who would hire
street thugs to do his dirty work?

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:17.381
I never wanted any of this.

01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:20.977
Of course you didn't. I'm sure you didn't.

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:24.113
You're married,
and you got involved with an ex-lover

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:26.315
whom you must have known
wasn't too tightly wrapped,

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:29.480
not playing with a full deck
of cards, as they say,

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:34.791
with deep mental and emotional
disturbances and issues

01:21:34.891 --> 01:21:37.961
and all that googly crap we talk about.

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:42.231
You got involved because
you wanted to shine in court.

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:48.426
Probably fill some gigantic hole
in your dreary, insipid, lackluster life.

01:21:48.526 --> 01:21:52.141
You know, you knew the risks,
but you proceeded anyway.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:57.220
It rained, and you got wet,
and I have no sympathy.

01:21:58.246 --> 01:22:01.658
Now that you are down a rabbit hole,
the only question I have is...

01:22:01.958 --> 01:22:06.622
how far are you willing to go to get out?

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.458
Like the man said,

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:11.961
"it's better to go too far

01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:14.604
than not far enough."

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:17.438
Stalin.

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:38.406
<i>911 operator. What is your emergency?</i>

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.858
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yeah, look...

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:45.849
<i>Sir? I can't quite hear you.
Can you repeat that?</i>

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:34.348
Motherfucker! Come here!

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:41.752
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

01:24:43.811 --> 01:24:45.714
Charlie.

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:49.225
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.635
Hold on.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.313
Who are you?

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:13.466
Hey! I said who the fuck are you?

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:18.755
When they find you, you're looking
at three counts of murder one!

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.684
That's death in this state!

01:25:21.784 --> 01:25:25.288
Something tells me
I got a better lawyer than you.

01:25:25.588 --> 01:25:27.298
Why did you kill Emily?

01:25:29.657 --> 01:25:33.553
I didn't. I moved her.

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:35.656
Why?

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:39.275
You really don't know.

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:43.371
Don't you touch her! Hey!

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:46.182
Hey, Charlie, look at me!

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.217
No! No!

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:59.262
You son of a bitch! I'm gonna kill you!

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.794
Why are you doing this?

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:10.799
How is what I do any different
than what you do, Mr. Cahill?

01:26:10.899 --> 01:26:13.836
You think you're a righteous man
but you're not.

01:26:13.936 --> 01:26:16.004
You're just confused.

01:26:16.804 --> 01:26:19.983
There is no right, no wrong.

01:26:25.713 --> 01:26:27.491
Only what is true.

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:46.639
Die, you fucker! Die!

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:01.651
Help. We need help.

01:28:09.016 --> 01:28:10.719
We need help!

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.655
You're gonna be okay, baby.

01:28:12.755 --> 01:28:16.457
- I'm gonna come back to get you.
- Don't leave me, Ben.

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.852
- Ben. Ben.
- Sir, are you all right?

01:28:19.061 --> 01:28:21.337
Don't leave me.

01:28:25.150 --> 01:28:26.757
- Okay.
- Sir?

01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.900
Is she gonna make it?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.508
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Listen, man, just leave town. You have to.

01:28:32.608 --> 01:28:37.514
Listen, no, I'm not going anywhere until
I figure out who did this. Do you hear me?

01:28:38.314 --> 01:28:42.818
Now, I've got the laptop
from the guy who tried to kill me.

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:47.363
I'm gonna send you an encrypted file
and I need you to try to decipher it.

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.925
<i>Okay. Why?</i>

01:28:50.025 --> 01:28:53.162
Because I think
I figured out who did this...

01:28:53.262 --> 01:28:55.705
and I just need the proof.

01:29:28.262 --> 01:29:32.166
Been reading about you
here in the paper, manhunt.

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:34.002
Fuck you.

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:35.904
- You want some coffee?
- Listen to me.

01:29:36.004 --> 01:29:40.483
- Is everything all right here, Mr. Abrams?
- Yeah, everything's fine, Susie, just fine.

01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:42.911
No. Thank you for inquiring, honey.
Thank you.

01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:46.982
- Let me know if you need me.
- I sure will. Keep your eye on us, too.

01:29:47.082 --> 01:29:48.925
I will.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:52.028
You...

01:29:54.789 --> 01:29:57.024
You've looked better.

01:29:57.124 --> 01:29:58.827
I should fucking put you in the ground.

01:29:58.927 --> 01:30:02.164
Oh, boy, you got evidence
against you, son.

01:30:02.264 --> 01:30:07.402
Direct, circumstantial.
It's all over the place, son. It's...

01:30:07.502 --> 01:30:11.039
It's just not in your favor.
Oh, I forget, the motive, too.

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:13.876
Why did you do it?
Why did you do this to me?

01:30:13.976 --> 01:30:17.353
What? Do what?
I didn't do anything to you.

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:21.858
I killed somebody because of you.

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:25.666
Oh, no. You did that on your own.

01:30:25.766 --> 01:30:28.296
No. No.

01:30:29.096 --> 01:30:31.727
You did this to me, and I can prove it.

01:30:31.827 --> 01:30:33.929
- You can prove it?
- I can prove it.

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.705
Be my guest.

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:40.336
I didn't kill Emily.

01:30:41.036 --> 01:30:43.672
Any good lawyer will tell you
it doesn't matter what is.

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.842
It's what "is" looks like.

01:30:50.344 --> 01:30:54.216
There was a biker, a man on a motorcycle,

01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:58.120
who tried to bury me underneath a church.

01:30:58.270 --> 01:31:01.347
- Yeah?
- Anyway, I snapped his neck.

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:04.726
You know him?

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:07.129
I've never heard of him, no.

01:31:07.229 --> 01:31:09.498
No, I think you do because you hired him.

01:31:09.598 --> 01:31:12.067
Unfortunately for you, this guy also kept

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:16.979
a very detailed expense report
on his laptop, just like an accountant.

01:31:17.438 --> 01:31:21.443
See, I got a tech guy who was able
to trace the accountant

01:31:21.543 --> 01:31:23.545
right back to you.

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:27.957
I smell a blackmail here.
Yeah, is that what you're doing?

01:31:28.057 --> 01:31:30.786
- Blackmailing me?
- You think I'm blackmailing you?

01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:35.224
- Why the fuck would I blackmail you?
- Listen, never bullshit a bullshitter, son.

01:31:35.324 --> 01:31:38.427
- You know how I built my reputation?
- How did you build your reputation?

01:31:38.527 --> 01:31:41.397
Breaking down every crooked banker

01:31:41.497 --> 01:31:45.634
and CEO sociopath
this side of the Mason-Dixon,

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:48.704
bullshitting me every day of the week.

01:31:48.804 --> 01:31:52.775
You know, I do the wrong thing
for the right reasons just like you.

01:31:52.875 --> 01:31:55.210
Who do you think you'll be
without your reputation?

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:59.114
Reputation, Mr. Cahill,
is an idle impression,

01:31:59.214 --> 01:32:03.552
is "oft got without merit,
lost without deserving."

01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:05.741
- There's some Shakespeare for you.
- Yeah.

01:32:05.841 --> 01:32:09.324
Can you handle it?
I'll take care of my reputation.

01:32:09.424 --> 01:32:13.136
What's gonna really bog us down now, buddy

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:15.340
is you thinking...

01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:18.000
having the audacity...

01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:22.485
and the profound ignorance
to think you can take me down.

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:28.518
We got company.

01:32:35.182 --> 01:32:40.589
The state of Louisiana from 1979 till now,

01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:46.262
has executed 659 criminals,
some of them guilty,

01:32:46.662 --> 01:32:51.333
with eight waiting in line,
queued up, ready to go next.

01:32:51.433 --> 01:32:53.976
I'm waiting for you to join them.

01:33:01.308 --> 01:33:05.447
My profound ignorance uncovered something.

01:33:05.547 --> 01:33:08.484
You been working with Arthur Denning
the whole time,

01:33:08.584 --> 01:33:11.720
taking bribes,
throwing cases for him for years.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:16.124
And now he's hanging you out to dry.
You are done.

01:33:16.224 --> 01:33:19.127
I'm gonna crucify you and you know it.

01:33:19.227 --> 01:33:22.497
You sure you want to play
this game with me?

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:25.941
You should probably run
while you still have a chance.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:27.603
Fuck you.

01:33:27.703 --> 01:33:30.246
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:34.909
You're in my church now,
and I suggest you leave it.

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.945
Mr. Abrams.

01:33:37.045 --> 01:33:40.748
- George. Hey, George...
- Keep your hands on the table.

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:43.025
What's going on?

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:48.474
- You're not gonna give me a manicure, are you?
- Now, on the table.

01:33:48.924 --> 01:33:52.226
Well, this is embarrassing
for both of us, I think.

01:33:52.326 --> 01:33:56.572
I will crucify you. Believe me, I will.

01:33:59.083 --> 01:34:01.020
Enjoy your pen.

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:06.608
- Go ahead, motherfucker!
- Mr. Abrams, I need you to put that down!

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:09.936
Didn't know I had that in me, did you?

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:14.316
Put it on the ground
and back away from the weapon.

01:34:16.216 --> 01:34:18.719
It has come to this, hasn't it?

01:34:18.819 --> 01:34:21.197
It has come to this.

01:34:23.924 --> 01:34:27.970
You do the wrong thing
for the right reasons.

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:33.901
You stretch yourself...

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.879
beyond the limits.

01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:42.318
You want to see a man ain't got no limits?

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:47.816
You're going to jail.

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:50.593
Criminals go to jail.

01:34:56.257 --> 01:34:59.094
I'm sorry about this, 'cause...

01:34:59.494 --> 01:35:02.197
I don't like this kind of thing.

01:35:02.297 --> 01:35:04.534
Please pardon...

01:35:05.184 --> 01:35:07.366
the theatrics.

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:40.643
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch this settlement fall apart!

01:35:42.603 --> 01:35:47.075
If we don't find him,
a lot of people gonna get hurt.

01:35:47.175 --> 01:35:50.953
- Understand?
<i>- I understand, Charles.</i>

01:36:11.398 --> 01:36:13.943
You having second thoughts?

01:36:17.137 --> 01:36:19.340
I'm dying.

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.117
I know that.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:25.861
Why'd you ever come work for me?

01:36:26.413 --> 01:36:31.510
I agreed to work for you because I thought
you and I wanted the same thing...

01:36:31.610 --> 01:36:33.721
the truth.

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:37.758
There's no truth in the law.

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:40.136
Everybody lies.

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:44.540
Stop searching for it.

01:36:45.532 --> 01:36:48.010
Ain't gonna find it, so...

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:59.120
Neither will you.

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:06.629
I'm gonna miss you, too, Dougie.
Yep. Yeah.

01:37:07.654 --> 01:37:10.192
Look, look, it's not like we're
moving to China, all right?

01:37:10.292 --> 01:37:13.028
We're just moving a couple hours away.

01:37:13.128 --> 01:37:16.611
How about we facetime on the weekends?
How's that sound?

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:22.612
All right. All right. You're a good man,
Dougie. I'll see you later.

01:38:49.656 --> 01:38:51.212
Hey.

01:38:51.312 --> 01:38:53.820
Hey. What's wrong?

01:38:57.331 --> 01:39:00.142
I'm gonna ask you this one time...

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:03.479
and I need you to tell me the truth.

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:09.952
Okay.

01:39:12.679 --> 01:39:15.891
Why does this smell like Emily's perfume?

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:19.829
I mean, you don't even wear perfume.

01:39:44.478 --> 01:39:46.989
It was an accident.

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:51.662
I went to confront Emily,
and she was weird.

01:39:51.762 --> 01:39:54.104
She was high...

01:39:54.204 --> 01:39:56.715
and she slapped me.

01:39:59.893 --> 01:40:02.865
And I was so mad at her...

01:40:02.965 --> 01:40:05.021
and you.

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:11.313
The guy in the church, he knew.

01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:16.536
In the back of your mind,
I thought that you knew, too.

01:40:21.615 --> 01:40:24.019
I pushed her.

01:40:24.119 --> 01:40:26.167
She fell.

01:40:27.287 --> 01:40:31.896
Her head hit the table
and she didn't get up.

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:39.167
I could have helped her...

01:40:39.567 --> 01:40:43.446
but I didn't help her
because I thought that if she...

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:47.783
if her heart stopped beating...

01:40:49.009 --> 01:40:51.088
then mine...

01:40:51.588 --> 01:40:53.952
would stop hurting.

01:40:55.449 --> 01:40:57.693
It kind of did.

01:41:06.426 --> 01:41:08.371
It's okay.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.608
It's just us.

01:41:21.959 --> 01:41:25.504
Well, we've got a busy day
ahead of us tomorrow.

01:41:28.448 --> 01:41:30.960
I'm gonna finish packing.
