Dorsal root ganglia.
Fascinating.

00:19.638 --> 00:21.944
Ahh. Bumblebee,
no touching a ganglion.

00:21.945 --> 00:27.612
Sorry. It's just being here...
Coolest thing ever.

00:35.628 --> 00:38.346
We've reached the site
of the incursion.

00:38.548 --> 00:41.049
Give me
the 600 nanometer emitter.

00:47.700 --> 00:49.944
You see,
most problems can be solved

00:49.945 --> 00:52.212
by reducing them to
their smallest components.

00:54.139 --> 00:57.909
I'm through the first layer.
Increase power by 40 watts.

01:01.046 --> 01:02.513
<i>Ow!</i>

01:02.581 --> 01:05.823
- We're hurting him!
- I know. I'm sorry.

01:05.855 --> 01:08.156
But short-term pain equals
long-term gain.

01:09.554 --> 01:14.097
- It's... Generating its own antibodies.
- Keep working. I'll hold them off.

01:19.776 --> 01:21.209
There are too many!

01:26.470 --> 01:28.076
It's no good.
We have to abort.

01:28.077 --> 01:31.220
Shrink back down. You're too
large for micro extraction.

01:35.811 --> 01:39.331
They're repairing the damage.
We've accomplished nothing.

01:39.378 --> 01:42.546
Atom to dr. Cross. Prepare
for emergency extraction.

01:47.592 --> 01:49.699
Extraction, now!

02:05.778 --> 02:08.517
What happened in there?

02:08.547 --> 02:11.165
There were...
Complications.

02:11.197 --> 02:16.211
<i>You were warned, Jaime Reyes. This scarab
could not allow this tactic to succeed.</i>

02:16.252 --> 02:19.603
What about the scarab?
Can you remove it or not?

02:20.497 --> 02:23.848
I'm afraid its integration with
your biosystem is too complete,

02:23.849 --> 02:25.481
Its defenses, too thorough.

02:25.482 --> 02:28.383
Jaime, I don't believe
that scarab is ever coming off,

02:28.634 --> 02:30.802
<i>Not while you live.</i>

02:33.717 --> 02:37.527

<i>The question isn't whether our world's
finest are the galaxy's most wanted,</i>

02:48.076 --> 02:52.972
<i>it's not whether they've been using
secret, undercover, covert operatives</i>

02:52.993 --> 02:55.789
<i>against targets
of their own choosing.</i>

02:55.815 --> 02:59.918
<i>No, it's not even whether
these interstellar hoodlums have</i>

02:59.919 --> 03:04.522
<i>their own watchtower in orbit
over our planet!</i>

03:04.584 --> 03:09.854
No, old G. Gordon proved
all that a week ago, didn't he?

03:09.922 --> 03:11.990
So the question is this...

03:12.058 --> 03:15.360
How long are you going
to stand for this

03:15.375 --> 03:19.497
and do nothing to check
these lawless heroes?

03:21.700 --> 03:26.071
Well, I'll just wait here
for you to make up your minds.

03:26.139 --> 03:30.757
Take your time. If you're not
in a hurry, why should I be?

03:30.796 --> 03:35.295
Meanwhile, Earth's true
benefactors, The Reach,

03:35.319 --> 03:41.320
have been working openly and without
fanfare for the betterment of all mankind.

03:41.388 --> 03:45.990
<i>Exhibit "A": Lexcorp Farms,
where The Reach has partnered</i>

03:46.027 --> 03:51.698
<i>with noted philanthropist Lex Luthor
to increase food production.</i>

03:51.766 --> 03:56.078
<i>Lexcorp and The Reach
are even allowing public tours...</i>

03:56.094 --> 04:00.617
<i>Just openness
and an end to world hunger.</i>

04:00.618 --> 04:04.537
<i>Now, why didn't the Justice League
think of that?</i>

04:04.587 --> 04:08.734
Obviously, any partnership between
The Reach and Lex Luthor is bad news,

04:08.741 --> 04:12.164
<i>So Alpha Squad is going undercover
to recon Lexcorp Farms.</i>

04:12.165 --> 04:15.363
<i>- Robin, you'll be running Alpha.</i>
- Me? Run Alpha?

04:15.364 --> 04:18.055
- Uh, right. Who's on the squad?
- Blue Beetle...

04:18.057 --> 04:20.743
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I should not be in the field, <i>ese</i>.

04:20.744 --> 04:23.145
What if the scarab goes
all Reach Apocalypse on us?

04:23.146 --> 04:27.286
Your scarab has had multiple
opportunities to betray us. It hasn't.

04:27.287 --> 04:30.360
And right now, its connection
to The Reach may be our best shot

04:30.361 --> 04:31.937
at identifying
what they're up to.

04:31.938 --> 04:37.109
<i>There, Jaime Reyes. Listen
to the Nightwing. His logic is flawless.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:39.199
Well, if Blue's going,
I'm going.

04:39.214 --> 04:42.810
I assumed as much.
And last but not least, Arsenal.

04:42.811 --> 04:45.210
<i>But you'll have to travel lighter
for your first mission...</i>

04:45.211 --> 04:48.328
<i>Nothing that won't fit under
civilian clothes. Any questions?</i>

04:48.343 --> 04:51.019
Just one.
Why are we meeting in this dump?

04:51.050 --> 04:53.988
With the Cave and
the Hall of Justice destroyed,

04:54.012 --> 04:55.802
we don't have many other options.

04:55.810 --> 05:00.791
Except the Watchtower. It's national news
now. You can't pretend it doesn't exist.

05:00.825 --> 05:03.493
Only Justice Leaguers
and senior members of the Team

05:03.494 --> 05:05.890
are authorized
for the Watchtower.

05:05.916 --> 05:09.281
- You don't qualify.
- Good to know where we stand.

05:09.304 --> 05:13.432
<i>Please remain seated at all times
while the tram is in motion.</i>

05:25.787 --> 05:30.376
We've just entered one
of our farm's hydroponics domes,

05:30.394 --> 05:35.499
where Lexcorp and The Reach
are growing the food of the future.

05:35.514 --> 05:38.694
This could put the rest
of Smallville's farmers out of business.

05:38.727 --> 05:42.621
No, no. Not at all. The Reach
plans to share their techniques

05:42.622 --> 05:46.078
with the entire
agricultural community.

05:46.314 --> 05:49.267
Please, everyone,
enjoy your choice

05:49.290 --> 05:52.748
of these new vitamin-rich,
reach-enhanced produce.

05:52.764 --> 05:54.264
Genetically enhanced?

05:54.286 --> 05:57.771
There's been no tinkering
with genes, rest assured.

05:57.803 --> 06:02.522
The Reach have ways of drawing out
an organism's full potential.

06:02.561 --> 06:04.895
<i>Oh, my Lord,
this is delicious.</i>

06:04.916 --> 06:08.151
<i>- The flavor!
- Now that's a rutabaga!</i>

06:14.706 --> 06:17.942
- What?
I'm maintaining cover.

06:26.058 --> 06:27.503
What's in those tubes?

06:27.526 --> 06:32.062
Just water, nutrients,
and a little Reach/Lexcorp love.

06:32.093 --> 06:35.001
Our next stop is
the pluot orchard.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.287
<i>That's right...
Pluots, in April!</i>

06:38.332 --> 06:41.443
- Time for a bathroom break.
- I went before we left.

06:41.474 --> 06:44.360
Ah, dude, they don't have pluots
in the future.

06:46.203 --> 06:49.739
State your grievance,
Sportsmaster.

06:49.807 --> 06:51.599
The Cape Canaveral op.

06:51.625 --> 06:57.602
Manta's son, Aqualad, killed my daughter
Artemis without my permission.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.094
<i>As the Light's enforcer,
I expect reparations.</i>

07:01.108 --> 07:06.380
<i>We grieve at your loss and offer
substantial monetary compensation.</i>

07:06.393 --> 07:11.817
And normally, I'd be fine with that.
But this goes to the heart of my rep.

07:11.855 --> 07:15.394
Word gets out I took a payoff,
I look like a cheap punk.

07:15.441 --> 07:17.937
Then what do you suggest,
old friend?

07:18.005 --> 07:22.440
You know the code: an eye for an eye...
A kid for a kid.

07:22.471 --> 07:25.387
- No one touches my son.
- Agreed.

07:25.388 --> 07:28.307
The death of Kaldur'ahm
is a non-starter.

07:28.330 --> 07:34.020
Fine. If the minnow's under the size
limit, I'll go fish for the whale.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.526
Deathstroke.

07:41.065 --> 07:45.792
I see you didn't waste any time
hiring my replacement, "old friend".

07:46.081 --> 07:50.869
- Fortune favors the prepared.
- You don't say...

08:11.385 --> 08:13.485
Don't give me that look,
little girl.

08:13.510 --> 08:16.889
Honor demanded I make the request!
They denied it.

08:16.912 --> 08:20.560
Now, I'm free to seal my rep
by killing Manta.

08:20.585 --> 08:24.264
Oh, and you can take your
precious vengeance on Aqualad.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.936
<i>Tell me
that doesn't make you smile.</i>

08:44.153 --> 08:47.490
<i>Ugh...! Can we please
start the mission now?</i>

08:47.557 --> 08:49.725
<i>Fine. Yes. Go.</i>

08:51.928 --> 08:55.585
- You're in the wrong mode.
- Dude, I crash all modes.

08:55.608 --> 08:59.401
- "Stealth mode", <i>hermano</i>.
- Oh, right.

08:59.437 --> 09:02.675
Now, where exactly did I...

09:03.306 --> 09:06.525
Ow! Thanks?

09:36.119 --> 09:39.073
- What's she saying?
<i>- Translating...</i>

09:39.476 --> 09:45.812
OK. Uh, she's warning her technicians
to go easy on the additive. Just a sec.

09:47.717 --> 09:52.905
<i>There, Jaime Reyes. The contents of
that bin are non-terrestrial in origin.</i>

09:56.026 --> 09:58.389
That's it.
That's your additive.

09:59.629 --> 10:01.263
- Where did he...
- Shh!

10:06.770 --> 10:08.955
Got what we came for.
Let's go.

10:11.474 --> 10:14.468
Two guards, one door hack,
and we're home free.

10:14.492 --> 10:16.474
- What?
- Wait for it.

10:19.721 --> 10:23.685
You blew the lab? But this was
a covert op! What were you thinking?

10:23.720 --> 10:27.309
That I'm not about to let Lex Luthor and
his alien space buddies poison the world

10:27.310 --> 10:30.184
just because we don't know exactly
what poison they're using.

10:30.212 --> 10:33.089
Plus, I enjoy
making Lex miserable.

10:33.183 --> 10:36.365
<i>Well, that placid scene
seems unlikely.</i>

10:36.398 --> 10:40.481
I'd say we've been hacked.
Try a frequency override.

10:42.672 --> 10:45.046
<i>Now, that makes more sense.</i>

10:45.077 --> 10:47.375
No, Mercy. No guards.

10:47.443 --> 10:49.892
Guards would be...
Redundant.

10:49.922 --> 10:53.837
Just sit back
and enjoy the show.

10:57.902 --> 10:59.157
All clear!

11:00.930 --> 11:04.993
You just don't get it, do you? You went
off mission. That was a huge mistake.

11:05.028 --> 11:08.997
Funny, I was about to say
the same thing.

11:31.668 --> 11:34.748
<i>I may not move
as fast as you, meat,</i>

11:34.757 --> 11:40.988
but my scarab processes faster than
even you can run, let alone think.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.970
Ohh!

11:49.342 --> 11:53.424
Now, that's just
a waste of good fruit. Unh!

11:53.552 --> 11:57.174
<i>No, that's just
a distraction. Ha!</i>

12:03.016 --> 12:06.744
- Any more tricks, <i>meat?
- Just a few.</i>

12:11.126 --> 12:14.555
Ahh... Nothing like
a warm plasma bath

12:14.556 --> 12:19.088
to calm the nerves and clean
off the tomato stains.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.845
Seriously?
The fruit hurt more.

12:29.348 --> 12:33.661
Trying to suck away my oxygen?
I hardly touch the stuff.

12:33.717 --> 12:37.526
Blue, what gives? Last time you threw
down with this guy, you were hardcore!

12:37.550 --> 12:39.798
That wasn't me!
Scarab was in control.

12:39.813 --> 12:43.562
<i>- So give me control again.</i>
- Believe me, I'd like nothing better.

12:43.599 --> 12:47.457
But I can't risk that, not with Impulse's
prophecy hanging over my head.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.415
Your laser. It's the only
thing that's done any damage.

13:12.594 --> 13:15.431
- My son,
I've brought visitors.

13:16.079 --> 13:19.854
Robbed of life,
even of a noble death.

13:19.855 --> 13:24.492
I will have my revenge on the
Martian witch that did this to him.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.996
As a father myself,
I understand your pain.

13:28.063 --> 13:30.798
And the opportunity
for vengeance will come.

13:30.866 --> 13:36.153
But in the meantime, let's focus
on making Kaldur'ahm whole again.

13:36.216 --> 13:40.607
I've borrowed Psimon from
Queen Bee for you and your boy.

13:40.675 --> 13:47.213
<i>He'll sift Kaldur'ahm's mind for every
fractured memory, every buried thought.</i>

13:47.281 --> 13:51.884
By the time Psimon's work is complete,
your son will be whole,

13:51.952 --> 13:57.318
and Psimon will know more about
Kaldur'ahm than his own father.

14:04.998 --> 14:08.685
- You're just toying with us, aren't you?
- What gave me away?

14:11.538 --> 14:13.706
- Time to go?
- Yeah. Do your thing.

14:21.782 --> 14:23.558
Go, go!

14:32.425 --> 14:34.727
Did a quick recon.
Want the options?

14:34.794 --> 14:37.396
- Cornfield or cornfield?
- Cornfield.

14:39.799 --> 14:41.266
I know you could fly
out of here.

14:41.334 --> 14:44.035
And you could run about 1,000 miles
before Black Beetle could blink.

14:44.103 --> 14:46.038
If I took Arsenal,
could you carry Robin?

14:46.106 --> 14:50.110
- Sorry. Fast, not strong.
- Well, Alpha never leaves a man behind.

14:50.813 --> 14:56.250
- We'll double back, maybe lose him.
<i>- That doesn't seem likely.</i>

15:06.627 --> 15:10.197
How many colors do these guys
come in, anyway?

15:16.787 --> 15:19.790
Form up. If we go down,
we go down fighting.

15:19.803 --> 15:22.571
I'm betting that sounded
way more inspirational in your head.

15:40.677 --> 15:43.278
Warrior,
you dare attack me?

15:43.306 --> 15:46.241
You scarab rejects are coming
out of the woodwork tonight.

15:46.285 --> 15:48.853
Better to be a reject
than a slave.

15:49.061 --> 15:53.530
- Uh, this guy? Not in history books.
- Then who is he? What is he?

15:58.629 --> 16:02.027
Density shifting, shape shifting,
all the powers of a martian except...

16:02.028 --> 16:05.494
<i>Heroes of Earth, I established this
link to better coordinate our attack.</i>

16:05.495 --> 16:07.272
<i>Telepathy. That clinches it.</i>

16:07.273 --> 16:10.042
<i>This guy's the Blue...
Green Beetle of Mars.</i>

16:10.043 --> 16:12.909
So another alien?
Do we leave them to fight it out?

16:21.898 --> 16:24.690
<i>Move in, Blue. Frontal assault.
Keep Black busy.</i>

16:24.720 --> 16:26.692
<i>Impulse, put out the fire.</i>

16:26.720 --> 16:30.399
<i>Arsenal, use your laser on that plasma
cannon. I want it out of commission.</i>

16:30.412 --> 16:32.346
<i>Right.
Be prepared to move.</i>

16:50.518 --> 16:53.413
Aah!

17:07.670 --> 17:10.587
<i>I was kind of hoping that might
have had a more lasting effect.</i>

17:10.588 --> 17:13.357
<i>Your methods are crude,
but you have the right idea.</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:17.412
<i>Beetle of Earth, fire your sonic
cannon at 27 angstroms precisely.</i>

17:17.480 --> 17:20.915
<i>Uh, my scarab's telling me
that tactic will be ineffectual.</i>

17:20.983 --> 17:22.588
<i>That's a quote,
by the way.</i>

17:22.617 --> 17:25.372
<i>For one scarab,
the tactic would be ineffectual.</i>

17:25.406 --> 17:29.576
<i>But tonight, it is not alone.
27 angstroms, now.</i>

17:31.795 --> 17:34.330
Ha! Tickles.

17:41.572 --> 17:43.506
Aah!

17:46.609 --> 17:48.672
<i>Scarab says he won't be
unconscious for long.</i>

17:48.703 --> 17:50.752
<i>- That is true.
- Then what do we do now?</i>

17:50.785 --> 17:52.388
<i>Now, we run.</i>

17:54.660 --> 17:56.121
<i>Dude,
what are you doing?</i>

17:56.122 --> 17:58.382
<i>Wherever we're going,
I could totally get there first.</i>

17:58.383 --> 18:00.550
<i>Uh, where are we going?</i>

18:04.447 --> 18:07.115
<i>Thanks for the use
of your barn, Mr. Kent.</i>

18:07.146 --> 18:11.901
Until we check out this Green Beetle,
we can't afford to bring him to our H.Q.

18:11.969 --> 18:13.703
Lost too many of those
already.

18:13.770 --> 18:17.206
Well, he's not the oddest
thing we've had in this barn.

18:17.274 --> 18:20.793
And I'll take any excuse
to see one of my boys.

18:20.832 --> 18:26.228
My name is B'aars O'ohm.
And obviously, I am of Mars.

18:26.244 --> 18:29.179
Obviously. But it's the beetle
thing that's got us wondering.

18:29.199 --> 18:31.181
How are you connected
to The Reach?

18:31.208 --> 18:34.316
I imagine my story
is not dissimilar to yours.

18:34.334 --> 18:38.037
On Mars, I am what you would
call an archaeologist.

18:38.097 --> 18:41.537
Two of your Earth years ago,
I stumbled upon a scarab

18:41.556 --> 18:43.824
which attached itself
to my person.

18:43.844 --> 18:46.379
Yeah. That last part
sounds familiar.

18:46.408 --> 18:50.973
From the scarab, I learned of The Reach
and their plan for the galaxy.

18:51.005 --> 18:56.256
Millennia ago, they sent out one scarab
to every planet sporting primitive life

18:56.280 --> 19:00.278
The scarab bonds with, and takes
full control over its native host,

19:00.310 --> 19:04.521
<i>giving The Reach an advanced operative
for their inevitable invasion.</i>

19:04.589 --> 19:07.660
But my scarab malfunctioned
and didn't take full control.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.713
That's why The Reach wants
to reboot it by killing me.

19:10.744 --> 19:13.579
So, did your scarab
malfunction, too?

19:13.610 --> 19:17.113
No. But it was not prepared
for the martian physiology,

19:17.114 --> 19:21.881
which allowed me to take control of the
scarab instead of the other way around.

19:22.210 --> 19:25.431
Still doesn't explain
how you wound up here.

19:25.469 --> 19:28.958
For decades, the one you call
Martian Manhunter

19:28.959 --> 19:31.794
has sent communications
from your world to ours...

19:31.818 --> 19:34.819
Television signals.
They are quite entertaining.

19:34.910 --> 19:37.625
- All Martians love television.
- Indeed.

19:37.656 --> 19:40.483
But when it became clear that
The Reach were on Earth,

19:40.484 --> 19:44.087
I believed my assistance here
would be required.

19:44.152 --> 19:46.554
The Justice League will need
to confirm your story.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.718
But for now, thanks.

19:50.796 --> 19:54.799
So, other than our new friend
here, how'd the mission go?

19:54.800 --> 19:57.631
Not quite as planned.
Arsenal...

19:58.128 --> 20:02.909
Is a little rough around the edges.
But I guess it all worked out,

20:02.910 --> 20:06.245
And we brought back a sample of
the alien additive for analysis.

20:06.357 --> 20:08.908
Can't ask for more.
Good work.

20:11.868 --> 20:17.779
<i>Forgive this mental intrusion, Jaime
Reyes, but your fear screams out to me.</i>

20:17.780 --> 20:22.430
<i>You fear losing yourself to your
scarab, and so, wish it removed.</i>

20:22.638 --> 20:27.007
<i>But I am here to tell you,
there is another way.</i>

20:30.059 --> 20:32.464
<i>All in all,
the damage is minor.</i>

20:32.759 --> 20:35.443
In fact, the most profitable
piece of the business

20:35.444 --> 20:38.747
was left entirely untouched
and seemingly undiscovered.

20:38.854 --> 20:41.289
The first crops have been
harvested and distilled.

20:41.327 --> 20:44.025
Shipments are already being
distributed to needy nations

20:44.046 --> 20:46.648
and soon will be available
worldwide.

20:46.667 --> 20:51.849
Amazing how one little bottle
contains everything the body needs.

20:51.887 --> 20:57.638
Or more accurately, everything
The Reach needs it to need.

20:57.682 --> 21:00.551
Did the children procure
a sample of the additive?

21:00.596 --> 21:04.164
As anticipated.
The Team was quite effective.

21:06.180 --> 21:09.725
<i>We really must form
one of our own.</i>
