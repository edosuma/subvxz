- That's a drag.
- Nah. I'm kind of used to it.

spending the summer

05:12.800 --> 05:14.433
Before I assign you to your bunks,

05:14.433 --> 05:16.933
I'd like to lay down a few rules.

05:16.933 --> 05:21.633
One: No leaving your bunks at
night and sneaking out anywhere.

Wake up at 6:00.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.800

and maybe the most important
one of all.

You write home to your parents
every day-- every day!

05:52.667 --> 05:54.667
Okay, that's it.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.167
You guys follow my rules,

05:56.167 --> 05:58.167
and you're gonna have
the best time of your lives.

- Yeah!
- All right!

06:00.433 --> 06:01.867
What's that, Uncle Al?

06:01.867 --> 06:05.000
- The forbidden bunk.
- Why is it called the forbidden bunk?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.033
Because it's forbidden.
So stay clear!

let's get you guys settled in.

clean sheet out the window?

- It bit Mike!

Get that out of my face. I just ate.

08:15.633 --> 08:19.367

maybe I got a bandage.

- We gotta do something.
- You think you know more than me?

ready. We got campfire at 1900.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.067
I wanna see the nurse.

08:34.067 --> 08:36.667
What nurse?

- There's no nurse?
- No!

runs a camp for wimps?

13:35.167 --> 13:39.200
[ Brush Rustling ]

13:45.167 --> 13:47.167
Mike?

13:53.767 --> 13:55.700
[ Gasps ]

14:02.900 --> 14:05.567
Who are you?

14:05.567 --> 14:08.400
You and your bunkmates better get
your sorry hides down to the lodge.

14:08.400 --> 14:12.167
Where's Larry? We got a missing
camper. I gotta talk to him.

14:12.167 --> 14:15.500
Larry's eating breakfast. He
sent me over here to get you guys.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.767
If you got a problem, you take
it up with him. Now get going.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.633
[ Boys Chattering ]

14:32.133 --> 14:34.600
Ugh!

14:46.133 --> 14:48.100
Larry, Mike's gone.

14:52.033 --> 14:56.067
Well, if it isn't
the little Eagle Scout.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.367
- Why aren't you guys at your table?
Where's Mike?

14:58.367 --> 15:01.900
Go back to your table.
This one's for counselors only.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.833
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, his stuff's gone.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.833
[ Billy ]
Did Uncle Al send him home?

15:06.833 --> 15:08.933
- Yeah, maybe.
- [ Counselors Laughing ]

15:09.933 --> 15:11.933
Forget it, Billy.
Let's go. Come on.

15:11.933 --> 15:14.333
I wanna find out
what happened to Mike.

15:14.333 --> 15:18.267
Geez, Larry, you got a bunch
of whiners this summer?

15:18.700 --> 15:21.633
Where is he, Larry?

15:21.633 --> 15:23.433
Mike's not here, Billy.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.800
So I guess maybe
he's somewhere else.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.467
Satisfied?

15:35.167 --> 15:36.667
Uncle Al must have sent him home.

15:36.667 --> 15:38.233
I mean,
his hand was pretty swollen.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.200
Then how come Larry
won't tell us what's going on?

15:40.200 --> 15:42.933
Counselors aren't supposed
to talk about bad stuff.

15:42.933 --> 15:45.100
Yeah. It might give us
poor little kids nightmares.

15:45.100 --> 15:49.333
- [ Clapping ]
- Okay, you guys.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.533
Get your faces out of
your bowls and listen up.

15:51.533 --> 15:54.233
Who's for a serious game
of baseball?

15:54.233 --> 15:57.633
- [ All ] Yeah!
- Well, let's go!

15:58.067 --> 16:00.700
- Come on, Billy.
- The guy's bad news.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.267
Forget about him. Come on.
Let's play some ball.

16:07.533 --> 16:10.100
Go, Colin.
Go. Go, go, go.

16:11.733 --> 16:13.533
- Safe.
- [ Jay] Yeah!

16:13.933 --> 16:16.500
- [ Uncle Al ] Batter up.
- Play ball!

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Let's go.
Come on, Billy.

16:21.400 --> 16:24.767
- What are you doing? Let's go!
- Come on, Billy. Batter up.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.800
Do you know what happened
to Mike, Uncle Al?

16:27.300 --> 16:30.767
- Mike? Which one's Mike?
- Last night, snakebite.

16:30.767 --> 16:33.333
- Oh, yeah, yeah. The blond kid.
- Yeah.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.733
Just you play ball, son.
Okay?

16:34.733 --> 16:37.433
Don't make
mountains out of molehills.

16:37.433 --> 16:40.033
You're here to have fun,
so start having it.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.167
Come on. We need a hitter.
Play ball.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.667
Step in, Billy.

16:44.667 --> 16:47.700
[ Boy ]
Let's go! Come on, Billy.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.700
I'm gonna strike you out.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.267
Strike!

16:59.133 --> 17:00.467
Come on, Billy. Get me
out of here. Hit me home.

17:01.100 --> 17:02.967
[ Boy ]
Bring him home!

17:02.967 --> 17:07.767
Yeah! Go, go, go!
Run! Run, Billy.

17:07.767 --> 17:11.400
Go for third, Colin.
Go, go, go.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.633
- You're out of here.
- You're out of your mind.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.300
- Safe by a mile!
- Safe at third.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.933
[ Laughs ] What?

17:18.433 --> 17:21.367
He beat the throw, Larry.
Now play ball.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.633
Larry!

17:24.200 --> 17:26.467
Batter up.

17:26.900 --> 17:29.433
All right! Here we go!

17:35.533 --> 17:37.667
[ Boy ]
Run!

17:42.867 --> 17:45.800
- [ Ball Strikes Helmet ]
- [ Groans ]

17:56.233 --> 17:58.300
Colin?

18:02.733 --> 18:04.733
He hit him right in the head!

18:04.733 --> 18:07.733
Come on, man. The guy was
running on the baseline.

18:07.733 --> 18:09.233
The ball just slipped out of my hand,
Uncle Al.

18:09.233 --> 18:10.733
It's all right, Larry.

18:10.733 --> 18:13.733
It's not your fault.
What's the kid's name?

18:13.733 --> 18:15.733
Colin. Maybe he's got
a concussion or something.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.200
He should get some help.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.367
- [ Uncle Al ] Nah. You're all right.
- Come on.

18:19.367 --> 18:20.933
[ Groans ]

18:21.433 --> 18:23.233
You're okay.
Come on. Tough it out.

18:23.233 --> 18:26.100
Take him to the lodge, Billy,
and ice down this lump.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.100
[ Groaning ]

18:27.100 --> 18:29.600
Then I want the both of you
to get to the flagpole pronto.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.267
 [ Chuckles ]
You've got some tents to set up.

18:32.267 --> 18:33.767
Tonight is survival night.
A major Nightmoon tradition--

18:33.767 --> 18:35.867
[ Colin, Woozily ] Batter up.

18:35.867 --> 18:39.600
where each night a different bunk
gets to sleep under the stars,

18:39.600 --> 18:41.733
live off the land.

18:41.733 --> 18:45.000
Bunk four, you're up first.
[ Laughs ]

18:49.333 --> 18:51.833
[ Billy Think ] Dear Mom
and Dad. I miss you a lot.

18:51.833 --> 18:52.833
I hope you're okay.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.833
I'm all right, but there's
something strange about this camp.

18:55.833 --> 18:59.333
Weird things have been happening.
My counselor Larry's a real jerk.

18:59.333 --> 19:02.333
But Uncle Al, the camp director,
seems like an okay guy.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.333
Maybe it's just me.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.333
Maybe I'm just a little nervous,
first time at camp and all.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.433
I hope your work is going well.
I love you both. Billy.

19:09.833 --> 19:12.167
- [ Tent Unzips ]
- Billy!

19:12.167 --> 19:14.433
- Get that out of my face.
- It's awesome out there!

19:14.433 --> 19:15.933
Come on, Billy.
Let's break some rules.

19:15.933 --> 19:18.733
The forbidden bunk awaits you.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.867
You guys aren't really
going up there, are you?

19:21.367 --> 19:23.467
Come on, man.
It's a perfect night.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.800
We can't just leave him.
You guys go ahead.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.333
He's fine, man.
Come on.

19:30.333 --> 19:34.400
- [ Groaning ]
- Nah. I think I'm gonna stay.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.467
- Oh, whatever. Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah, come on.

19:50.633 --> 19:53.900
[ Sabre Growling ]

20:12.700 --> 20:14.633
- Billy!
- Jay!

20:15.133 --> 20:17.633
It tore Roger. It tore Roger to
pieces, and it's gonna get us!

20:17.633 --> 20:20.633
Whoa, whoa, okay. You warn the
other guys. We gotta get Colin.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.733
No, forget it, man.
We got to get to our bunks!

20:22.733 --> 20:24.067
You do what you want.

20:24.067 --> 20:26.633
Billy!

20:27.100 --> 20:30.167
- Colin, get out of there!
- Sabre's coming.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.700
- Come on, man. We gotta go.
- Sabre's hungry.

20:32.700 --> 20:35.633
- Help me.
- Got him?

20:35.633 --> 20:38.000
Come on. Yeah.
Let's go. Go, go. Hurry!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.500
[ Colin Groaning ]

20:39.500 --> 20:42.000
Come on. Go, go, go.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.333
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Groans ]

20:44.333 --> 20:47.700
[ Growling ]

20:47.700 --> 20:52.167

- Hurry! Hurry up!

20:52.167 --> 20:54.533

20:55.467 --> 20:58.267
He had claws and teeth!
