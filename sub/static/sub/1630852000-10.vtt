<b><i>This little light I've found</i></b>

00:08.610 --> 00:12.770
<b><i>Take it in,
breathe it out</i></b>

00:15.170 --> 00:19.260
<b><i>A little drum
that's beating loud</i></b>

00:21.540 --> 00:25.530
<b><i>In my chest,
I hear the sound</i></b>

00:31.220 --> 00:33.070
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:33.760 --> 00:35.560
<b><i>Feel you now</i></b>

00:36.030 --> 00:39.100
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

00:39.100 --> 00:41.150
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:41.900 --> 00:45.090
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

00:57.040 --> 00:59.170
<b>You're a product from a factory.</b>

01:00.100 --> 01:02.330
<b>A skinjob.</b>

01:02.790 --> 01:05.620
<b>You don't have real feelings.</b>

01:05.620 --> 01:06.540
<b>Miu!</b>

01:06.870 --> 01:10.550
<b>Poor misguided defect!</b>

01:10.840 --> 01:14.870
<b>Now then, let's find out 
why you're a deviant.</b>

01:42.750 --> 01:44.700
<b>That didn't look too restful.</b>

01:44.700 --> 01:45.700
<b>Are you all right?</b>

01:56.390 --> 01:57.320
<b>Well...</b>

01:58.640 --> 02:00.690
<b>don't think about it too much.</b>

02:04.310 --> 02:06.130
<b>You got what you wanted.</b>

02:15.530 --> 02:18.200
<b>I thought the nightmares would 
go away once they were all dead.</b>

02:19.370 --> 02:20.970
<b>But I still see it...</b>

02:21.770 --> 02:23.000
<b>in my head.</b>

02:24.490 --> 02:25.830
<b>Sorry to hear that.</b>

02:34.430 --> 02:35.840
<b>The past is the past.</b>

02:36.380 --> 02:38.840
<b>Sometimes it needs a 
little help to fade away.</b>

02:39.220 --> 02:40.800
<b>It won't, for me.</b>

02:46.810 --> 02:49.130
<b>Replicant memories don't fade.</b>

02:54.900 --> 02:58.440
<b>Sometimes memories linger, 
even if you're human.</b>

03:11.920 --> 03:16.020
<b><i>Just as the sun is setting</i></b>

03:16.550 --> 03:20.170
<b><i>It's like something I'm forgetting</i></b>

03:20.720 --> 03:24.850
<b><i>Far from a new beginning</i></b>

03:25.330 --> 03:28.000
<b><i>Bye, bye, love</i></b>

03:29.980 --> 03:33.270
<b><i>Night's getting long and colder</i></b>

03:34.440 --> 03:38.230
<b><i>And time only leaves me older</i></b>

03:38.750 --> 03:42.650
<b><i>This plan is far from over</i></b>

03:42.970 --> 03:46.050
<b><i>Bye, bye, love</i></b>

03:47.470 --> 03:50.160
<b><i>Hearts roll in</i></b>

03:50.730 --> 03:54.570
<b><i>The shifting tide</i></b>

03:55.260 --> 03:59.140
<b><i>They all roll in</i></b>

03:59.600 --> 04:03.310
<b><i>And cloud my mind</i></b>

04:04.430 --> 04:08.640
<b><i>Bye, bye</i></b>

04:09.600 --> 04:12.860
<b><i>Love</i></b>

04:20.480 --> 04:22.750
<b>Thank you. You're very kind.</b>

04:31.870 --> 04:33.660
<b><i>Officer Joseph.</i></b>

04:33.660 --> 04:36.820
<b><i>Is this the day you actually call for backup?</i></b>

04:36.830 --> 04:39.980
<b>Actually, I just wanted to let you know 
I've located the last target.</b>

04:41.510 --> 04:43.590
<b><i>Wait. The last one?</i></b>

04:44.930 --> 04:46.910
<b><i>Hmm. Smug bastard.</i></b>

04:47.220 --> 04:49.220
<b><i>Almost done isn't the same as done.</i></b>

04:51.520 --> 04:53.180
<b>Is when it's me.</b>

04:53.520 --> 04:56.020
<b>I always save the easiest for last.</b>

05:12.620 --> 05:13.930
<b>Thank you.</b>

05:14.650 --> 05:16.210
<b>The way you sing, it's--</b>

05:16.780 --> 05:18.210
<b>it's so moving.</b>

05:18.210 --> 05:20.050
<b>The emotion in your voice, I--</b>

05:22.130 --> 05:23.840
<b>Oh. Good.</b>

05:24.340 --> 05:26.840
<b>I was hoping you'd come see me tonight.</b>

05:27.300 --> 05:28.140
<b>Oh.</b>

05:28.660 --> 05:31.220
<b>Excuse me.
I don't want to intrude.</b>

05:31.220 --> 05:32.760
<b>Thank you again.</b>

05:33.270 --> 05:34.980
<b>It was lovely meeting you.</b>

05:39.540 --> 05:41.280
<b>Won't you come in?</b>

05:48.910 --> 05:50.490
<b>Quite a performance.</b>

05:51.620 --> 05:52.740
<b>Thank you.</b>

05:53.580 --> 05:57.000
<b>But you didn't come to 
appreciate my singing...</b>

05:59.050 --> 06:00.390
<b>Detective.</b>

06:03.170 --> 06:05.090
<b>What makes you think I'm a cop?</b>

06:05.840 --> 06:07.220
<b>It's pretty obvious.</b>

06:10.340 --> 06:12.800
<b>Same seat every night</b>

06:12.800 --> 06:14.670
<b>but only drink soda water.</b>

06:16.350 --> 06:19.730
<b>If you're not a cop, 
you're a terrible alcoholic.</b>

06:21.560 --> 06:24.070
<b>Maybe I'm a stalker who's in love with you.</b>

06:25.960 --> 06:27.530
<b>That must happen.</b>

06:36.250 --> 06:38.660
<b>You were trying to see if I was human.</b>

06:41.420 --> 06:43.040
<b>Yet you didn't run.</b>

06:43.790 --> 06:46.050
<b>Replicants don't live very long,</b>

06:47.050 --> 06:51.140
<b>and sometimes I get impatient 
to see what happens next.</b>

06:53.510 --> 06:54.980
<b>If life's so short,</b>

06:54.980 --> 06:57.810
<b>why spend it singing about 
emotions you can't understand?</b>

06:59.310 --> 07:02.900
<b>What better use for a life than to 
explore the essential mysteries?</b>

07:05.360 --> 07:08.740
<b>Isn't that why you do what you do, Detective?</b>

07:11.280 --> 07:13.370
<b>My job isn't that mysterious.</b>

07:15.530 --> 07:18.040
<b>I'd say I'm a mystery.</b>

07:20.840 --> 07:22.980
<b>Come back tomorrow, Detective.</b>

07:26.380 --> 07:28.670
<b>Find out what happens next.</b>

07:42.310 --> 07:44.230
<b>I couldn't go through with killing her,</b>

07:45.190 --> 07:47.030
<b>so I went back the next night,</b>

07:48.260 --> 07:49.880
<b>the night after,</b>

07:50.400 --> 07:51.930
<b>back to the same bar.</b>

07:53.830 --> 07:55.340
<b>I knew it was stupid.</b>

07:56.210 --> 07:58.260
<b>If I wasn't gonna retire her,</b>

07:58.740 --> 08:00.870
<b>then best thing I could do for both of us</b>

08:01.410 --> 08:04.230
<b>was stay away, but...</b>

08:07.900 --> 08:11.170
<b><i>Take your hat and all your wishes</i></b>

08:11.170 --> 08:14.680
<b><i>Moonlight strolls and candy kisses</i></b>

08:14.680 --> 08:17.550
<b><i>Charming words that I believe</i></b>

08:17.550 --> 08:20.560
<b><i>To make a song for you and me</i></b>

08:21.540 --> 08:24.140
<b><i>The song we'll sing</i></b>

08:24.810 --> 08:27.900
<b><i>When all the nights get lonely</i></b>

08:27.900 --> 08:30.280
<b><i>Closer and closer we'll be</i></b>

08:36.610 --> 08:38.760
<b>Did the brass send you to hold my hand?</b>

08:38.740 --> 08:42.200
<b>Not yet, but you're asking for it.</b>

08:42.580 --> 08:45.500
<b>Figure it's better to take care of 
this before it comes to that.</b>

08:46.960 --> 08:48.420
<b>I'm fine.</b>

08:48.940 --> 08:52.140
<b>You also said your last target 
was confirmed a week ago.</b>

08:52.140 --> 08:53.340
<b>What happened?</b>

08:53.970 --> 08:55.090
<b>Nothing.</b>

08:55.470 --> 08:57.220
<b>Don't play pretend with me.</b>

08:59.380 --> 09:00.490
<b>Is it her?</b>

09:01.330 --> 09:03.940
<b><i>Closer and closer we'll be</i></b>

09:04.230 --> 09:06.190
<b>Being a pretty little songbird</b>

09:06.190 --> 09:08.520
<b>doesn't make her any less a replicant.</b>

09:08.580 --> 09:11.380
<b><i>Sprinkle in some candlelight</i></b>

09:10.360 --> 09:12.070
<b>And they only come to one end.</b>

09:11.740 --> 09:14.640
<b><i>That's the perfect recipe</i></b>

09:14.640 --> 09:17.450
<b><i>To make a song for you and me</i></b>

09:19.370 --> 09:21.120
<b>I know my job.</b>

09:23.120 --> 09:24.960
<b>Then why aren't you doing it?</b>

09:26.920 --> 09:28.500
<b>I like this song.</b>

09:29.090 --> 09:31.690
<b><i>Every time you hold me</i></b>

09:31.690 --> 09:34.600
<b><i>Closer and closer we'll be</i></b>

09:35.160 --> 09:38.000
<b><i>Baby, can't you see</i></b>

09:38.510 --> 09:41.140
<b><i>Baby, can't you see</i></b>

09:41.140 --> 09:44.520
<b><i>Let's make a song for you and me</i></b>

09:52.190 --> 09:53.780
<b>Song's over.</b>

09:54.640 --> 09:56.210
<b>Showtime.</b>

10:19.840 --> 10:21.550
<b>Don't tell me...</b>

10:21.550 --> 10:23.300
<b>With a skinjob?</b>

10:23.530 --> 10:24.670
<b>You're sick.</b>

10:26.900 --> 10:29.110
<b>If this gets out, you're done.</b>

10:29.110 --> 10:31.590
<b>Forget your career.
They'll lock you up.</b>

10:32.050 --> 10:33.410
<b>You're overreacting.</b>

10:34.310 --> 10:37.640
<b>I'm not gonna let you throw 
your life away for...that.</b>

10:39.000 --> 10:41.020
<b>It's not your choice to make.</b>

10:41.660 --> 10:43.230
<b>Finish the job.</b>

10:43.610 --> 10:44.620
<b>Tonight.</b>

10:46.170 --> 10:47.800
<b>Or I do it for you.</b>

10:48.270 --> 10:49.660
<b><i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i></b>

10:49.930 --> 10:52.660
<b><i>next is Serena's last number for the evening.</i></b>

10:59.530 --> 11:00.720
<b>Excuse me.</b>

11:00.950 --> 11:03.090
<b>I hear this is your last number.</b>

11:03.750 --> 11:05.520
<b>Make it count.</b>

11:10.530 --> 11:12.060
<b>I see.</b>

11:12.720 --> 11:14.990
<b>Enjoy the show, Detectives.</b>

11:29.420 --> 11:31.710
<b>You've all been so kind to me</b>

11:31.710 --> 11:34.070
<b>from my very first night on this stage,</b>

11:35.480 --> 11:38.730
<b>but sadly, there's an end to everything.</b>

11:39.270 --> 11:41.690
<b>And to good things as well.</b>

11:43.120 --> 11:45.320
<b>Time to see what happens next.</b>

11:54.520 --> 11:57.920
<b><i>Blind eyes so hard to read</i></b>

11:58.700 --> 12:01.990
<b><i>Your kisses bittersweet</i></b>

12:02.600 --> 12:05.710
<b><i>Nowhere for me to breathe</i></b>

12:06.060 --> 12:09.270
<b><i>My, my love</i></b>

12:10.790 --> 12:14.040
<b><i>The coldness of disrepair</i></b>

12:14.660 --> 12:18.090
<b><i>Circling in the air</i></b>

12:18.700 --> 12:21.810
<b><i>Slow fate is never fair</i></b>

12:21.810 --> 12:25.460
<b><i>My, my love</i></b>

12:26.700 --> 12:29.390
<b><i>Could this be</i></b>

12:29.390 --> 12:32.790
<b><i>My love, could this be</i></b>

12:32.790 --> 12:36.330
<b><i>Our last goodbye</i></b>

12:42.530 --> 12:45.130
<b><i>Could this be</i></b>

12:45.130 --> 12:48.450
<b><i>My love, could this be</i></b>

12:48.450 --> 12:52.120
<b><i>Our last goodbye</i></b>

13:06.350 --> 13:08.980
<b><i>Could this be</i></b>

13:08.980 --> 13:12.510
<b><i>My love, could it be</i></b>

13:14.050 --> 13:17.620
<b><i>When no love can understand</i></b>

13:18.080 --> 13:21.820
<b><i>Reach out and hold your hand</i></b>

13:21.820 --> 13:25.300
<b><i>No place for love to land</i></b>

13:25.300 --> 13:28.800
<b><i>My, my love</i></b>

13:29.870 --> 13:33.360
<b><i>Don't know if it's wrong or right</i></b>

13:33.900 --> 13:37.710
<b><i>Or time to give up the fight</i></b>

13:37.710 --> 13:41.180
<b><i>Lonely has lit its light</i></b>

13:41.180 --> 13:43.920
<b><i>My, my love</i></b>

13:44.510 --> 13:46.170
<b><i>No, no, no</i></b>

13:46.170 --> 13:48.800
<b><i>Could this be</i></b>

13:48.800 --> 13:52.450
<b><i>My love, could this be</i></b>

13:52.450 --> 13:54.050
<b><i>Yeah</i></b>

13:54.050 --> 13:56.690
<b><i>Could this be</i></b>

13:56.690 --> 14:00.310
<b><i>My love, could this be</i></b>

14:01.090 --> 14:03.820
<b><i>Our last</i></b>

14:04.380 --> 14:07.350
<b><i>Goodbye</i></b>

14:30.610 --> 14:32.440
<b>I'm sorry, I--</b>

14:33.050 --> 14:34.280
<b>Shh.</b>

14:36.680 --> 14:39.430
<b>I can almost hear...</b>

14:39.430 --> 14:40.320
<b>Huh?</b>

14:57.550 --> 15:00.650
<b>You shot her...?</b>

15:03.350 --> 15:06.410
<b>I've dreamed about that 
damn bar every night since.</b>

15:09.000 --> 15:12.680
<b>So yeah, I know a little 
something about not being able</b>

15:12.680 --> 15:14.150
<b>to leave your past behind.</b>

15:28.330 --> 15:31.740
<b>I might not always be 
here to take care of you.</b>

15:33.790 --> 15:37.350
<b>The memory maker said someone 
tampered with my mind.</b>

15:39.500 --> 15:42.380
<b>Added more memories after he was finished.</b>

15:44.740 --> 15:46.610
<b>Is that what you want me to tell you?</b>

15:47.310 --> 15:50.940
<b>That all your happiest memories are a lie?</b>

15:51.420 --> 15:53.000
<b>No, but...</b>

15:55.590 --> 15:57.800
<b>If you're real and you love me...</b>

15:59.730 --> 16:01.470
<b>Why haven't you found me?</b>

16:04.730 --> 16:06.380
<b>Are you even looking?</b>

16:10.720 --> 16:12.000
<b>It could be...</b>

16:13.150 --> 16:16.890
<b>That I need you to find me.</b>

16:31.340 --> 16:33.590
<b>There's one more person I need to find.</b>

16:36.530 --> 16:38.340
<b>But I don't know his name.</b>

16:39.840 --> 16:41.780
<b>Didn't we get them all?</b>

16:42.590 --> 16:44.960
<b>It's not someone I have to kill.</b>

16:47.340 --> 16:48.480
<b>Family?</b>

16:48.990 --> 16:51.460
<b>Not family. He's my...</b>

16:53.000 --> 16:54.790
<b>Someone important.</b>

16:55.550 --> 16:56.910
<b>You have a picture?</b>

16:59.610 --> 17:01.440
<b>Only memories.</b>

17:08.650 --> 17:09.720
<b>Stay there.</b>

17:25.030 --> 17:26.580
<b>Good to see you too.</b>

17:27.160 --> 17:28.720
<b>Need to borrow something.</b>

17:30.800 --> 17:33.260
<b>What comes after a sword in the list of necessities?</b>

17:37.600 --> 17:40.710
<b>She moves in and we don't talk anymore.</b>

17:40.710 --> 17:43.000
<b>What exactly is gong on?</b>

17:43.000 --> 17:44.680
<b>Nothing to do with her.</b>

17:44.680 --> 17:47.320
<b>Just a side project.</b>

17:47.750 --> 17:49.150
<b>Side project?</b>

17:49.150 --> 17:52.240
<b>A side project you're working on in the middle of the night,</b>

17:52.240 --> 17:54.650
<b>that you won't even explain?</b>

17:54.650 --> 17:56.500
<b>Buddy, I thought we were friends.</b>

17:58.960 --> 18:00.710
<b>Some things, you're better off not knowing.</b>

18:04.770 --> 18:06.040
<b>But wait, wait a minute.</b>

18:06.040 --> 18:08.140
<b>Relax, I'll get it back to you good as new.</b>

18:10.100 --> 18:11.620
<b>Don't you trust me?</b>

18:13.920 --> 18:16.370
<b>You're the one with trust issues!</b>

18:20.390 --> 18:22.420
<b>Elle, sit here.</b>

18:29.730 --> 18:33.250
<b>This might give us a lead on
 the guy you're looking for.</b>

18:44.750 --> 18:46.360
<b>It's gonna take a while.</b>

18:54.570 --> 18:56.990
<b>Think of the person you want to remember.</b>

19:41.990 --> 19:43.640
<b>I'm going to find you.</b>

20:08.570 --> 20:09.430
<b>Elle?</b>

20:22.990 --> 20:24.810
<b>This the guy you're looking for?</b>

20:31.380 --> 20:32.440
