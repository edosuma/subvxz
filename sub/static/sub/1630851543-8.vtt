Betsy said that she's tired.

Well, she should be.

Here you go Betsy, dear.

Yeah, how's that, honey?
Yeah.

Oh, one more thing:
she hates the air-conditioning.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.148
She says that the cold air
disturbs her beauty rest

- It's so nice to see you.
- Pleasure is mine.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.720
- How long have you been
playing the bass?

13:41.754 --> 13:45.624
- Let's see, about 40 years.
- Oh.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.625
So what was
your very first magic trick?

13:48.059 --> 13:50.062
- My very first magic trick?
- Mm-hmm.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.663
- Well, I was born
on the West Side of Chicago,

13:51.697 --> 13:55.033
which is kind of a rough
neighborhood, and it still is.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.036
I was in the second grade,

13:57.068 --> 13:59.672
and I was approached
by two gangs of kids.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.841
Yeah, at recess,
and they approached me,

14:01.874 --> 14:03.576

to join our street gang.

14:03.609 --> 14:05.644
Whose gang are you
going to be in?"

14:05.677 --> 14:07.879

in a gang of punks,

and whoever wins,

14:09.782 --> 14:11.082
I'll join your gang."

14:11.115 --> 14:13.519
So they started fighting,
and about 5 minutes later,

14:13.552 --> 14:15.386
after the dust had settled,
they looked around

14:15.421 --> 14:17.523

I had disappeared.

21:04.328 --> 21:05.696

21:05.730 --> 21:07.699

with the shield is.

- Mm-hmm.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.201

to turn around.

You start to mix them up.
When I turn back around,

21:14.673 --> 21:16.340

to get this right.

on a subconscious level

33:36.346 --> 33:39.416
I think for the first 20 years
of my career,

33:39.450 --> 33:41.419
I performed silently on stage

33:41.451 --> 33:45.022
because I was too afraid
to speak,

33:45.056 --> 33:47.125
but then I wanted
to do a longer act,

33:47.157 --> 33:48.625
and you have to speak.

33:48.659 --> 33:50.661
You can't do, you know,
two hours of silent stuff.

33:50.694 --> 33:52.296
I tried.

33:52.329 --> 33:53.431
- Well, that was wonderful.

33:53.463 --> 33:55.298
Let's see if you fooled
Penn and Teller.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.268
- Okay.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.804
- Hey, Bobby.
Good to see you.

33:59.836 --> 34:02.773
Boy, that's classic magic,

34:02.807 --> 34:05.175
which we do not get enough of
on the show,

34:05.209 --> 34:08.945
a good,
classic silk dye routine,

34:08.980 --> 34:11.148
a lot of Al Baker in there

34:11.181 --> 34:14.985
and a story going all the way
through, not just silk dyeing,

34:15.018 --> 34:16.954
but actually going through
the whole thing.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.724
And I'll tell you, the drop
of the blue handkerchief

34:19.757 --> 34:21.626
looks like a real accident.
- Oh, good.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.795
- And that's
a really nice moment

34:23.827 --> 34:26.297
when you start thinking you're
a step ahead of the magician,

34:26.329 --> 34:28.733
the magician
is really a step ahead of you.

34:28.766 --> 34:29.967
And the good news is,

34:30.001 --> 34:32.936
we love having classic magic
done beautifully.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.572
The stuff you're doing there
is really hard.

34:35.606 --> 34:37.675
There's hard manipulation stuff
in there,

34:37.708 --> 34:39.210
and it's really,
really wonderful.

34:39.242 --> 34:43.114
But the fact that it's classic
means we're thrilled

34:43.146 --> 34:46.083
to have you on the show,
and the fact that it's classic

34:46.117 --> 34:48.820
also means we probably know
how you did it.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.822
- Right.
I figured that.

34:50.855 --> 34:52.356
- Just wonderful.

34:52.389 --> 34:54.458
- So they know the magic?

34:54.492 --> 34:56.460
- Yeah, I think they have
a very good idea.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.628
- Yeah.
Well, thank you so much.

34:58.663 --> 35:00.431
It was wonderful
watching you perform.

35:00.465 --> 35:04.001
- It was a pleasure.

♪ ♪

35:26.657 --> 35:27.891
- Welcome back.

35:27.925 --> 35:30.360
Penn and Teller
have been dazzling audiences

35:30.393 --> 35:32.496
for more than 4 decades.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.898
Here with a little trip
down Memory Lane

35:34.931 --> 35:39.103
is our legendary duo,
Penn and Teller.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.505
[applause]

35:41.539 --> 35:43.474
- My children
are teenagers now,

35:43.507 --> 35:44.876
but especially
when they were younger,

35:44.909 --> 35:46.409
Teller was a great uncle.

35:46.443 --> 35:49.480
He'd always do little
magic tricks for the children.

35:49.514 --> 35:50.815
One of his favorite things
to do

35:50.847 --> 35:53.317
was to tell them
about his partner before me--

35:53.351 --> 35:56.253
it was named Pen,
but with one N--

35:56.286 --> 35:59.657
and the tricks that Pen, one N,
and Teller would do,

35:59.690 --> 36:01.559
and the trick he loved
to tell them about

36:01.592 --> 36:03.793
was how he would take Pen
with one N

36:04.295 --> 36:07.264
and tear him apart,
rip him apart,

36:07.297 --> 36:10.367
and then magically
put him back together.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.335
He couldn't just put him
back together like this.

36:12.369 --> 36:15.206
He had to do this and then take
a little bit of whiffle dust

36:15.239 --> 36:19.643
and put Pen with one N
back together.

36:19.677 --> 36:21.112
[applause]
- They loved this trick.

36:21.144 --> 36:23.246
Teller would do it
over and over again,

36:23.280 --> 36:26.284
and finally the children
started to kind of catch on,

36:26.317 --> 36:28.186
for the way
you would do a destroyed

36:28.219 --> 36:30.855
and restored something is,
you have a duplicate.

36:31.588 --> 36:34.125
So Teller always had
a duplicate prop,

36:34.157 --> 36:35.826
another Pen with one N,

36:35.860 --> 36:38.295
and he would have
that hidden in his hand.

36:39.230 --> 36:41.666
And then he would take the Pen
with one N

36:41.699 --> 36:45.036
that the children saw,
rip it apart,

36:45.068 --> 36:47.771
and the children knew he had
the duplicate in his hand,

36:48.539 --> 36:50.574
and he would just switch them.

36:50.608 --> 36:53.177
So the children would watch
for the switch.

36:53.210 --> 36:56.880
And then he went to his pocket
for the whiffle dust,

36:56.914 --> 37:01.918
he would ditch the pieces,
come out with the whiffle dust

37:01.952 --> 37:04.655
and then just show
the duplicate.

37:04.688 --> 37:09.293
So by the time my children
were, like, 8 or 9,

37:09.327 --> 37:12.230
they were pretty sophisticated
in watching magic.

37:12.262 --> 37:15.565
And then one day,
we were all at the park,

37:15.599 --> 37:18.536
just relaxing,
having a good time,

37:18.568 --> 37:20.237
and the children
would always check

37:20.271 --> 37:22.806
Uncle Teller's hands
if he wasn't doing tricks,

37:22.840 --> 37:25.409
to make sure there was nothing
hidden in his hands.

37:25.443 --> 37:29.914
They were very, very careful,
and Teller had a balloon,

37:29.947 --> 37:32.215
and Teller was just going
to play with the children

37:32.250 --> 37:34.018
with a balloon.
He's blowing it up,

37:34.050 --> 37:35.820
and the whole time
he's blowing the balloon,

37:35.853 --> 37:37.355
they're watching
the balloon of course,

37:37.387 --> 37:41.025
but they're also making sure
his hands are completely empty.

37:41.791 --> 37:44.262
Now I don't remember exactly
what happened that day--

37:44.295 --> 37:46.998
maybe there's some
really mean guy in the park--

37:47.030 --> 37:50.800
but all of a sudden,
the balloon just popped.

37:51.601 --> 37:52.869
Now the children said

37:52.902 --> 37:55.172
"Uncle Teller,
put the balloon back together."

37:55.206 --> 37:56.840
But Teller tried to amuse them
in other ways.

37:56.873 --> 37:59.076
He said "Well, wait a minute,
I can use the pieces.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.711
it can be a mustache."
The children didn't care.

38:02.413 --> 38:05.016
He said "Hey, children,
it could be earrings,"

38:05.048 --> 38:06.617
and the children didn't care.

38:06.650 --> 38:10.021
And he said "Hey, children,
it could be snot."

38:11.088 --> 38:13.391
Now they liked the blue snot
a little better,

38:13.423 --> 38:14.659
but then he said

38:14.692 --> 38:17.894
"How about, children,
if I have a boutonniere?"

38:18.663 --> 38:21.532
And the children didn't know
what a boutonniere was

38:21.565 --> 38:24.702
and didn't care at all.
But Teller still did it.

38:24.735 --> 38:27.471
Then he said,
"How about we do some music?"

38:27.505 --> 38:31.275
And he turned the balloon
pieces into a kazoo.

38:33.543 --> 38:34.644
They didn't care.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.380
Then he turned it
into a guitar.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.617
I just said, "Pluck it."

38:39.650 --> 38:41.518
There we go.

38:41.552 --> 38:43.621
And then they said,
"No, Uncle Teller,

38:43.653 --> 38:46.956
"we saw your hands empty.
We saw no switch.

38:46.990 --> 38:50.193
"Why don't you just restore it,
you know,

38:50.226 --> 38:53.697
like you did Pen with one N,
but without a duplicate?"

38:54.764 --> 38:58.168
And sure enough, Teller just
blew up the balloon,

38:59.869 --> 39:02.306
and no matter how sophisticated
they were,

39:02.340 --> 39:04.041
they were impressed with that.
