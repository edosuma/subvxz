WEBVTT

00:02.398 --> 00:07.299
I need passion and
romance and sex in my life,

00:07.804 --> 00:09.378
and Martin just doesn't.

00:09.384 --> 00:10.679
I bet you never
would have dreamed

00:10.685 --> 00:13.052
you'd be eating street meat
and making out in a parking lot.

00:13.058 --> 00:15.269
Yeah, well, we're not
exactly making out.

00:16.534 --> 00:18.016
I wanna fix things with Lena.

00:18.022 --> 00:19.333
Dude, when did this happen?

00:19.339 --> 00:21.339
What if I had danced
with her at our wedding?

00:21.345 --> 00:23.909
Maybe it would have changed the
entire course of our marriage.

00:23.915 --> 00:25.835
I am so turned on right now.

_

00:43.794 --> 00:46.953
_

00:56.873 --> 00:59.678
Mae? I asked you to
put away your laundry.

01:00.301 --> 01:01.782
May I finish this chapter?

01:02.654 --> 01:05.887
And, Mason, it's your turn to
unload the dishwasher, remember?

01:05.893 --> 01:07.777
Just a sec.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.487
And, hey, what about you?

01:10.493 --> 01:12.703
Did you put the toys away
in your room like I asked?

01:14.590 --> 01:15.790
What is...

01:16.066 --> 01:17.266
What are you doing?

01:17.648 --> 01:20.151
What is... what is
going on? What are you...

01:22.857 --> 01:25.175
Are you running out
the clock right now?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.923
Are you stalling me

01:26.929 --> 01:28.811
until Dad Week so you don't
have to do your chores?

01:28.817 --> 01:30.828
If you could hear
how crazy you sound...

01:30.834 --> 01:32.034
Mae?

01:32.040 --> 01:34.327
- I plead the fifth.
- I plead the fifth, too,

01:34.333 --> 01:36.333
because we're
doing what you said.

01:36.432 --> 01:38.133
You suck at the fifth.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.530
Okay. I get it.
I get the appeal.

01:40.993 --> 01:43.226
Guess what. I'm in.

01:43.232 --> 01:45.227
I'm leaving my chores
for Dad Week, too.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.803
- She's bluffing.
- Is she?

01:46.809 --> 01:49.485
You don't know her. She's
a changed woman. She's loco.

01:49.491 --> 01:51.022
Okay, now you do sound crazy.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.098
Why is your third-person
persona Hispanic?

01:53.104 --> 01:54.514
No lo sé, mamacita.

01:56.906 --> 01:59.956
What is going on in here?

02:00.057 --> 02:01.354
Unclear.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.049
Mom's trying to be fun.

02:03.055 --> 02:05.448
Oh, Mom's pretty fun these days.

02:06.329 --> 02:08.941
I'd ask what that means,
but I'm too fun to care.

02:08.947 --> 02:12.127
And I'd pick up all this
clean laundry, but...

02:12.133 --> 02:14.525
my week is over. Bye!

02:14.531 --> 02:15.731
Text me if you need me.

02:16.114 --> 02:17.314
Okay.

02:17.462 --> 02:19.170
- Did you guys do your chores?
- Yep.

02:19.176 --> 02:22.197
- Yep.
- I plead the fifth because we didn't.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.173
How am I doing it wrong?

02:26.588 --> 02:28.967

02:28.973 --> 02:30.770
- Oh, you want some? Want some?
- Don't do it.

02:56.762 --> 02:59.552
And what's wrong with
you? You seem relaxed.

02:59.558 --> 03:01.611
I'm just really
enjoying dating...

03:01.919 --> 03:03.481
and really enjoying Wes.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.102
You really enjoyed Wes?

03:05.426 --> 03:07.326
I really enjoyed him in a car.

03:07.332 --> 03:10.988
Oh, that must've been nice
after a two-year drought.

03:10.994 --> 03:13.023
Ohh. Really nice.

03:13.267 --> 03:15.206
And it wasn't just the sex.

03:15.212 --> 03:18.499
It was feeling wanted,
feeling desired.

03:18.600 --> 03:20.184
It gave me life.

03:20.190 --> 03:22.706
- It gave you life? Wow.
- Yeah.

03:22.712 --> 03:24.200
The only problem is Martin.

03:24.206 --> 03:26.692
He just... He's been really
cranky with me lately.

03:26.698 --> 03:29.805
Well, he can probably tell
that you've been "given life."

03:29.811 --> 03:31.016
Well, what does he care?

03:31.022 --> 03:34.510
He's in a full-blown relationship
with "Our Lady of Abs."

03:34.516 --> 03:37.610
Oh, hey! How's it going
with Operation Fetus?

03:37.616 --> 03:38.902
I did some research,

03:38.908 --> 03:40.707
and if I want to
do it on my own,

03:40.713 --> 03:43.200
I have to open an
account at the sperm bank.

03:43.206 --> 03:45.203
Will they link it
to a free checking?

03:45.646 --> 03:48.616
And then I have to sign a
semen-purchaser agreement.

03:48.622 --> 03:51.248
- Come again?
- And pay for storage.

03:51.254 --> 03:52.631
I thought we store it in you?

03:52.637 --> 03:54.944
And then there's the
most important step...

03:54.950 --> 03:56.460
choosing a donor.

03:56.531 --> 03:58.234
But, you know, the good news is,

03:58.240 --> 04:01.831
unlike dating, there
really is no rejection.

04:01.837 --> 04:03.511
If you find a guy you like,

04:03.835 --> 04:05.921
you can pretty much
just have his baby.

04:05.927 --> 04:08.728
He's not gonna be telling you
he's joining the Peace Corps

04:08.734 --> 04:11.432
and then you run into
him at Bed Bath & Beyond.

04:14.107 --> 04:17.023
I want you to know, if you
decide to go through with this,

04:17.038 --> 04:19.629
I am with you every
step of the way...

04:19.721 --> 04:21.346
and in a pretty good outfit.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.543
A really good outfit.

04:24.644 --> 04:26.663
Look at those boobies.

04:27.026 --> 04:29.027
- What happened?
- The whole thing was a nightmare.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.509
I didn't even get to dance...

04:30.515 --> 04:33.535
There is nothing sadder than a
talented dancer not getting to dance.

04:33.541 --> 04:37.117
...because Lena was hooking
up with some guy in his car.

04:37.519 --> 04:39.319
You know what? That is sadder.

04:39.325 --> 04:41.036
I mean, who has sex in a car?

04:41.042 --> 04:44.238
Camille. Me. Lena.

04:44.244 --> 04:45.812
I'm sorry. Was that rhetorical?

04:45.818 --> 04:47.230
I'll get it.

04:47.425 --> 04:48.746
Get what, buddy?

04:49.534 --> 04:51.348
Oh. Hey.

04:53.004 --> 04:54.206
You okay, pal?

04:54.912 --> 04:56.112
Ohh.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.103
This kid's got a fever.

05:00.181 --> 05:01.510
Sorry.

05:01.596 --> 05:03.946
This is the way the movie
"Outbreak" started. Mmm.

05:03.952 --> 05:05.249
Thanks for your concern.

05:05.255 --> 05:06.509
Is he gonna be okay?

05:06.571 --> 05:09.945
Of course. I have taken care
of many a sick child in my day.

05:09.951 --> 05:12.603
Let's get you upstairs
to bed and bundle you up.

05:14.441 --> 05:16.360
Or dress you lightly?

05:18.170 --> 05:20.433
I'm gonna WebMD it. All right.

05:25.213 --> 05:26.413
Hey.

05:28.814 --> 05:30.027
Don't mind me.

05:30.033 --> 05:31.707
Just keep putting
your party paint on

05:31.713 --> 05:33.001
while I parent our children...

05:33.007 --> 05:35.010
and you put on the
other half of that dress.

05:36.114 --> 05:37.603
Are you looking for something?

05:37.609 --> 05:40.232
- Board game. Ever heard of 'em?
- Board game?

05:40.238 --> 05:42.008
They're a wholesome
form of entertainment.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.336
Are you having
family game night?

05:44.813 --> 05:46.310
As a matter of fact, we are.

05:46.316 --> 05:47.697
You mind if I join you?

05:47.703 --> 05:50.193
Suit yourself. I think
we're gonna play Monopoly.

05:50.199 --> 05:51.520
I'll be the car.

05:56.004 --> 05:57.204
Hey.

05:58.866 --> 06:01.282
Yeah, that sounds great,
whatever you want. I'm chill.

06:01.288 --> 06:02.884
Chill? Chill?

06:02.890 --> 06:04.281
- Yeah, I'll see you in five.
- Chill?! She's chill?!

06:04.287 --> 06:06.861
- She's the opposite of chill!
- I am increasingly chill!

06:06.867 --> 06:09.494
She yelled in a
very un-chill way!

06:09.500 --> 06:11.238
Okay, stop it. There
is no narrating.

06:11.244 --> 06:12.444
Okay, back up. Fight's over.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.734
- Hey! You need to go.
- Ugh.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.154
We're almost out of time here.

06:24.456 --> 06:26.465
- This is a really nice place.
- Mm-hmm.

06:26.471 --> 06:28.168
This is the kind of
place you take a girl

06:28.174 --> 06:29.835
before she has sex with you.

06:29.841 --> 06:32.427
No. This is the kind of
place you take the girl

06:32.433 --> 06:34.828
that you really want
to keep having sex with.

06:34.969 --> 06:38.474
Welcome! My name is Grace, and
I'll be your server tonight.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.865
- Hi, Grace.
- Hi.

06:39.871 --> 06:43.773
Allow me to offer you our house
infused blackberry-sage water.

06:43.779 --> 06:45.248
Permission granted.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.942
- Infused.
- I know.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.071
Wow. That is the best
thing I've ever tasted.

06:53.048 --> 06:55.488
- You seem different.
- I do? How?

06:55.494 --> 06:57.591
Yeah. I-I don't know.
You seem lighter.

06:57.597 --> 06:59.201
At this time, we'd
like to remind you that

06:59.207 --> 07:01.296
this is a screen-free restaurant.

07:01.302 --> 07:03.086
We invite you to
stow your devices

07:03.092 --> 07:06.560
so you may better enjoy your
meal and each other's company.

07:06.566 --> 07:09.019
- Oh. Okay.
- Mmm.

07:09.574 --> 07:11.276
I'll just stow mine in my purse.

07:11.282 --> 07:13.561
Oh, but look how
sad his phone looks

07:13.567 --> 07:15.574
- all alone in there.
- Hm?

07:16.677 --> 07:18.487
I don't really
think it looks sad.

07:25.494 --> 07:26.694
Bloop!

07:28.401 --> 07:29.826
"Bloop," huh?

07:30.434 --> 07:32.739
I have to admit,
when we first met,

07:32.933 --> 07:35.013
- I didn't take you for a blooper.
- No?

07:35.019 --> 07:38.051
No. You seemed like
a woman with... stuff.

07:38.399 --> 07:41.649
Now look... you're giving up your
phone, you're making fun noises.

07:41.655 --> 07:43.157
I feel like I'm a
good influence on you.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.363
I think you are.

07:45.952 --> 07:47.588
But the stuff's still there.

07:47.743 --> 07:49.548
- Mm.
- For example, my ex,

07:49.554 --> 07:51.540
who I still live
with, is mad at me,

07:51.546 --> 07:53.204
and I think I know why.

07:53.210 --> 07:55.996
And I think it has
something to do with you.

07:56.002 --> 07:57.611
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

07:57.617 --> 07:59.192
Even though he's dating someone

07:59.198 --> 08:00.599
with an incredibly flat stomach,

08:00.605 --> 08:03.065
I'm not supposed to
date, because I'm the mom.

08:03.071 --> 08:05.874
And I'm trying not to buy into
that double standard, but it's weird

08:05.880 --> 08:07.474
- because he's home with the kids
- Mmm.

08:07.480 --> 08:08.779
doing a game night,
and that just...

08:08.785 --> 08:10.874
it makes me feel guilty
and absent and conflicted,

08:10.880 --> 08:12.757
and we had a big
fight before I left,

08:12.763 --> 08:14.076
where I may or may
not have hissed at him,

08:14.082 --> 08:16.503
and I kind of want to check in and
smooth things over, but I can't,

08:16.509 --> 08:19.331
because Grace took my phone,
and I hate her, but I like you,

08:19.337 --> 08:22.326
and I'm somewhat interested in the
veal, which I'm morally opposed to.

08:24.534 --> 08:25.814
Bloop.

08:26.215 --> 08:29.219
No! No way.

08:29.225 --> 08:32.011
You can't just...
bloop after that.

08:32.018 --> 08:35.315
Why not? The lightness
and the darkness coexist.

08:35.321 --> 08:37.224
I have many sides to me, Wes.

08:37.734 --> 08:39.429
Can you handle many sides?

08:39.524 --> 08:41.640
I can handle every side.

08:44.798 --> 08:47.507
Okay, say, "Ahh!" Like this...

08:47.513 --> 08:49.541
"Ahh!" Uh...

08:49.547 --> 08:51.921
Look, you're gonna have to stick
it right under your tongue, right,

08:51.927 --> 08:53.479
and then purse your
lips like this, like...

08:53.485 --> 08:56.502
- like-like you're sipping a straw.
- That's not how Mom does it.

08:56.508 --> 08:59.004
Well, I don't care how Mom
does it. This is how I do it.

09:00.887 --> 09:02.184
But just tell me how Mom does it

09:02.190 --> 09:03.998
so I can show you
how much I don't care.

09:04.004 --> 09:06.803
First, she puts her
lips on my forehead.

09:06.809 --> 09:09.163
Then, she takes
an armpit reading,

09:09.169 --> 09:12.366
and if it's over 100.9,
she slips me a $20.

09:12.372 --> 09:15.663
- What?
- Grape medicine and a $20 bill.

09:15.669 --> 09:17.616
- Yes, she does.
- No, she does not.

09:17.622 --> 09:19.613
- Yes, she does. Yes, she does, too,
- No, she doesn't.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.020
when you're not looking.

09:21.903 --> 09:24.098
So, if he's sick, does
that mean no game night?

09:24.104 --> 09:25.304
No game night.

09:25.491 --> 09:27.740
But maybe you could find some
other form of entertainment,

09:27.746 --> 09:30.262
like having sex on our
street outside the house?

09:30.355 --> 09:32.637
Sounds better than Monopoly.

09:33.526 --> 09:35.948
- Oh. You're talking about...
- Your sister?

09:36.025 --> 09:39.826
The mother of my children? Cleaner
of countertops? I saw her, okay?

09:40.924 --> 09:45.526
102.7. That's gotta be
worth at least 40 bucks.

09:46.025 --> 09:48.753
- I don't have any cash.
- Yeah, what's new?

09:49.729 --> 09:52.338
Hey. Since you're missing
out on family game tonight...

09:52.344 --> 09:54.332
- Mm-hmm.
- ...maybe we could play a game.

09:54.338 --> 09:55.932
Okay. What'd you have in mind?

09:55.938 --> 10:00.619
How about who can make the
other person blush first?

10:00.823 --> 10:02.089
Oh.

10:02.408 --> 10:04.017
Okay. I'm in.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.427
Whoa! I'm out. You win.

10:09.850 --> 10:11.050
Thank you.

10:11.877 --> 10:15.343
I hate to say it 'cause
she is an awful person,

10:15.349 --> 10:17.319
but, you know, Grace was right.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.818
Who needs phones?

10:20.950 --> 10:24.748
_

10:26.483 --> 10:28.556
_

10:28.562 --> 10:30.367
_

10:32.188 --> 10:35.468
_

10:40.996 --> 10:44.105
Oh, hey, Grace! Uh, I'm just
on my way to the ladies'.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.618
Would it be cool if I took a
glance at my phone real quick?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.429
Ohh. Your entrees
will be out shortly.

10:49.435 --> 10:52.109
Fantastic. Could I just
see my phone, please?

10:52.210 --> 10:55.282
Well, customarily, we
hand people their phones

10:55.288 --> 10:57.015
as they exit the restaurant,

10:57.021 --> 10:59.523
and, customarily,
they thank us for it.

10:59.529 --> 11:02.617
Okay, well, customarily, I
don't go dark on my three kids

11:02.623 --> 11:04.402
because some hipster
restaurant thinks that

11:04.408 --> 11:06.911
charred leeks are more
important than they are.

11:09.004 --> 11:11.203
Oh! The entrées are coming out.

11:11.209 --> 11:12.793
I hand-sauce them at the table,

11:12.799 --> 11:14.999
- so you might want to hurry back.
- Okay.

11:31.336 --> 11:33.715
_

11:33.721 --> 11:35.569
- Oh!
- _

11:35.575 --> 11:39.865
Chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug! Let me see?

11:40.145 --> 11:41.579
Yes! Nice.

11:41.585 --> 11:43.076
What's my prize?

11:43.082 --> 11:46.677
Well, for finishing your
drink, you get... two pills.

11:46.683 --> 11:49.357
Aww! I miss college.

11:49.456 --> 11:50.948
I don't know that
I'd ever be as good

11:50.954 --> 11:52.775
at this parenting
stuff as you are.

11:52.781 --> 11:55.093
- I'm thinking of trying.
- Yeah?

11:55.363 --> 11:57.667
On my own. You probably
think that's dumb.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.665
Dumb? Of course not.

11:59.671 --> 12:01.255
It's just a little
intimidating, you know,

12:01.261 --> 12:03.667
the amount of sheer vigilance
that you and Lena have.

12:03.673 --> 12:05.480
I just don't know
that I could do it.

12:05.486 --> 12:08.813
So you'll do it in
your own Maya way.

12:09.493 --> 12:11.507
I actually you're
gonna be a great parent.

12:11.705 --> 12:12.978
Well, thanks.

12:13.072 --> 12:14.994
That means a lot,
coming from you.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.200
You being sarcastic?

12:16.206 --> 12:17.785
Usually. Not right now.

12:17.791 --> 12:20.331
- Well, it sounded sarcastic.
- It's hard to shake.

12:21.543 --> 12:23.236
- Soup?
- I didn't order soup.

12:23.439 --> 12:25.197
- Someone did.
- Thank you...

12:25.462 --> 12:27.683
- for the soup. Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:28.078 --> 12:32.602
I have a feeling, uh-ah,
that it's my fault.

12:32.608 --> 12:34.462
I texted her an update.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.582
Oh, you see? You see? This
is... this is classic Lena,

12:38.588 --> 12:40.082
exactly how you
shouldn't parent.

12:40.088 --> 12:42.181
She is trying to
control this situation

12:42.187 --> 12:44.261
- even though she is not here.
- This is just soup.

12:44.267 --> 12:46.277
It is not just soup.

12:46.283 --> 12:49.979
It is doubt and
distrust... with noodles!

12:50.397 --> 12:52.700
She wants to out-parent
me while she's out there

12:52.706 --> 12:54.968
fooling around with
some guy in his car.

12:54.974 --> 12:58.584
My God. Why are you so stuck
on this guy and his car?

12:58.590 --> 13:01.608
Because I was trying to
be the guy in the car.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.652
Oh, yeah? What about
your girlfriend?

13:04.658 --> 13:06.012
- What?
- Oh, yeah,

13:06.018 --> 13:09.223
the PYT that has been
spotted on multiple occasions,

13:09.229 --> 13:12.135
- coming in and out of the garage?
- Charlotte?

13:12.519 --> 13:14.093
She's my dance teacher.

13:14.717 --> 13:15.928
That's hilarious.

13:15.934 --> 13:17.437
'Cause I was at your wedding.

13:17.443 --> 13:19.446
- You don't dance.
- Well, I do now.

13:19.452 --> 13:22.247
I was trying to surprise
Lena for our anniversary.

13:23.721 --> 13:25.534
But I'm the one
who got surprised.

13:28.670 --> 13:29.870
Milo.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.076
Soup.

13:33.158 --> 13:34.850
Daddy and I need a drink.

13:36.661 --> 13:38.194
I'm a terrible mother.

13:38.373 --> 13:41.295
My son is home sick,
burning up with a fever,

13:41.301 --> 13:43.576
and I'm living it up on
infused blackberry water.

13:43.582 --> 13:45.199
I can feel Martin
judging me right now.

13:45.205 --> 13:47.099
Why? You didn't know he
was sick when you left.

13:47.105 --> 13:49.113
Well, that's the other
thing. How did I not know?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.857
I can usually spot a fever
on that kid a mile away.

13:52.076 --> 13:54.151
Feel like my mom
instincts are dwindling.

13:54.157 --> 13:55.748
Hey, they're not dwindling.

13:57.068 --> 13:59.271
Who tore through every
item in this closet

13:59.277 --> 14:01.670
to check her phone even
after she was asked not to?

14:01.676 --> 14:03.117
Repeatedly asked not to.

14:03.123 --> 14:06.377
And then who used that
phone, during Blitz Pricing,

14:06.383 --> 14:09.392
to Post Mates poor sick little
Milo some overpriced soup?

14:09.398 --> 14:12.385
- I did.
- And in an effort to get you home faster,

14:12.391 --> 14:14.074
who asked Grace to
wrap up our dinners

14:14.080 --> 14:16.435
even though she warned us
they'd lose their complexity?

14:16.917 --> 14:19.292
- You did.
- That's right.

14:20.521 --> 14:22.307
Bye!

14:22.947 --> 14:24.625
Yeah, and there I
was in my wedding tux,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.729
holding this big, stupid
bouquet of flowers,

14:26.735 --> 14:29.000
and I waltz up the
driveway to find Lena

14:29.006 --> 14:31.240
and this guy in his car.

14:31.246 --> 14:34.467
That's more heartbreaking
than "Manchester by the Sea."

14:34.473 --> 14:36.538
Well, what are you
gonna do? We're divorced.

14:37.171 --> 14:40.772
But I still don't understand what
happened between the two of you.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.089
Well, what'd she say?

14:44.095 --> 14:46.367
Well, you know, Lena's
a pretty private person,

14:46.373 --> 14:47.995
and she doesn't tell me much.

14:48.081 --> 14:49.473
No sex for two years.

14:49.479 --> 14:50.712
Wow.

14:50.718 --> 14:52.714
- Okay.
- But true?

14:52.720 --> 14:55.925
Well, I feel like there was more
at play than that, but, yeah...

14:56.140 --> 14:57.340
probably.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.999
Look, I don't know, all right?
I don't know what happened.

15:00.005 --> 15:01.893
I guess, somewhere along
the way, with our different

15:01.899 --> 15:04.432
sleep schedules and
parenting ideals and...

15:04.438 --> 15:06.722
and constant bickering,
you know, I just...

15:07.813 --> 15:09.509
lost it for Lena.

15:09.515 --> 15:12.649
- You lost it?
- Yeah, interest, passion.

15:12.655 --> 15:14.631
My God, we're not even
talking about me now,

15:14.637 --> 15:15.969
and it's still hard to hear.

15:15.975 --> 15:17.975
Well, it's hard
to feel, you know?

15:17.981 --> 15:20.248
And then I see some
guy in a... in a car

15:20.254 --> 15:23.639
grabbing her ass, I-I-I
can't help but think,

15:24.083 --> 15:25.813
"That should be me in there."

15:26.987 --> 15:29.003
I mean, not in there with them,

15:29.009 --> 15:31.408
obviously. You know,
that would be weird. I...

15:32.071 --> 15:34.463
I-I just... I should've
forced myself to...

15:34.469 --> 15:38.359
No, Martin, no. You don't force
yourself to grab someone's ass.

15:38.365 --> 15:42.069
You do it 'cause you can't not,
'cause you're that into them.

15:42.654 --> 15:44.564
I mean, can you imagine ever

15:44.570 --> 15:47.198
having those feelings
for Lena again?

15:50.986 --> 15:53.492
Grace would kill herself
if she knew we were gonna

15:53.498 --> 15:56.640
eat this with plastic
utensils in my garage.

15:56.646 --> 15:58.519
- But we're not.
- Uh, yeah, we are

15:58.525 --> 16:00.515
'cause the good silver's
inside with Martin.

16:00.521 --> 16:02.407
Which is where I
think you want to be.

16:02.413 --> 16:03.929
What? No.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.824
No. I mean...

16:06.423 --> 16:09.318
Now that we're here, I wouldn't
mind doing a quick check-in.

16:09.324 --> 16:11.172
But after that, I'm all yours.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.303
You're definitely not all mine.

16:14.101 --> 16:15.428
Not tonight.

16:15.877 --> 16:18.108
- I'm sorry.
- No.

16:18.396 --> 16:20.310
I'll call you. Can I call you?

16:20.795 --> 16:22.391
Um... yeah.

16:25.795 --> 16:27.818
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:28.193 --> 16:29.414
Were you inside?

16:29.420 --> 16:31.208
How's Milo? Should
I go check on him?

16:31.214 --> 16:33.006
Uh, no, Martin's got it covered.

16:33.012 --> 16:35.701
- But I kind of want to see him.
- Yeah, but it's not your night,

16:35.707 --> 16:37.412
and Martin probably
doesn't want to see you

16:37.418 --> 16:39.396
fresh off the heels
of your date with Wes.

16:39.402 --> 16:41.736
What? What's that
supposed to mean?

16:41.781 --> 16:43.604
Has Martin brainwashed you?

16:43.610 --> 16:45.479
He had his girlfriend here,

16:45.485 --> 16:47.318
but I'm sullied because
I went on a date.

16:47.324 --> 16:50.107
Okay, no one's saying
sullied, it's 2018,

16:50.113 --> 16:52.149
and he doesn't
have a girlfriend.

16:52.258 --> 16:54.258
- What?
- Yeah. No girlfriend.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.734
That was his dance
teacher that he hired

16:56.740 --> 16:59.455
to surprise you on
your anniversary.

16:59.461 --> 17:01.056
Oh, my God.

17:04.054 --> 17:05.538
Oh, my God.

17:05.544 --> 17:07.157
And that's the night I was...

17:07.164 --> 17:08.752
- Sullied.
- Sullied.

17:19.046 --> 17:20.278
Let me guess.

17:20.347 --> 17:22.896
You're here to
demand access to Milo.

17:23.178 --> 17:26.494
No. I'm here to
demand access to you.

17:27.788 --> 17:30.474
Oh. Well, come in.

17:37.331 --> 17:39.317
I didn't know you'd been
taking dance lessons...

17:39.323 --> 17:41.715
- Oh, boy.
- ...or that you saw me the other night with Wes.

17:41.721 --> 17:45.036
Wow, so Maya is
basically an informant.

17:45.323 --> 17:49.185
- No. No, I just. I-I feel...
- She's a double agent. Stop.

17:49.191 --> 17:51.801
Just stop, okay? We
don't have to do this.

17:52.184 --> 17:55.480
- Everything is fine. It is. I swear.
- No, it's not fine.

17:55.808 --> 17:57.831
Look, honestly, I-I
think this played out

17:57.837 --> 18:00.522
- exactly the way it was supposed to.
- What does that mean?

18:00.528 --> 18:02.834
It means that I don't
know what I was thinking.

18:03.018 --> 18:05.748
What, that I could make one
stupid gesture, and then,

18:05.754 --> 18:08.005
you know, all of a sudden,
everything's gonna be okay?

18:08.011 --> 18:10.398
- It wasn't a stupid gesture.
- And seeing you...

18:10.727 --> 18:13.915
with that guy, it-it hurt, yeah.

18:14.110 --> 18:15.502
Hurt in what way?

18:15.508 --> 18:19.506
In the way that it hurts seeing
another man with your woman.

18:19.704 --> 18:20.995
"Your woman"?

18:21.001 --> 18:24.411
- So it hurt your ego?
- Oh, my God, Lena, are you...

18:24.417 --> 18:26.713
- are you serious right now?
- Are you, Martin?

18:26.719 --> 18:29.447
Come on. Did it hurt your
heart, or did it hurt your pride?

18:29.453 --> 18:33.129
Lena, I'm done, all right? I am
done! I am done with the scrutiny.

18:33.135 --> 18:34.824
And whatever way it
hurt, I'm sure it wasn't

18:34.830 --> 18:36.966
the right kind of
hurt for you, okay?

18:37.439 --> 18:39.445
And we-we-we... we push
each other's buttons,

18:39.451 --> 18:41.170
and we get under
each other's skin.

18:41.349 --> 18:42.923
Look, you deserve
the kind of passion

18:42.929 --> 18:44.459
that you felt that
night in the car.

18:44.537 --> 18:47.444
You deserve someone who
feels that way about you.

18:48.732 --> 18:50.563
And that someone isn't you?

19:00.460 --> 19:02.984
I think I would like
to see Milo after all.

19:13.104 --> 19:15.320
♪ This is not ♪

19:17.604 --> 19:20.716
- ♪ What we wanted... ♪
- He looks good.

19:20.722 --> 19:22.478
You must've pushed fluids.

19:22.484 --> 19:23.684
I did.

19:24.215 --> 19:26.499
Well, he's not feverish.

19:26.793 --> 19:29.278
Did you alternate
Tylenol and Motrin?

19:30.004 --> 19:31.204
I did.

19:31.415 --> 19:34.401
Well, you must've kept
a great dosing chart.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.230
Nope. Didn't need it.

19:36.236 --> 19:39.025
- Don't even know what that is.
- You know what that is.

19:39.298 --> 19:41.097
Dosing charts are for babies.

19:41.103 --> 19:44.170
Yes, babies and children that
you're trying not to kill.

19:45.657 --> 19:49.361
Well... to your credit, he
does not appear to be dead.

19:51.526 --> 19:54.044
- Did he trick you into giving him money?
- No.

19:57.524 --> 19:58.728
Hmm.

19:58.830 --> 20:00.527
Must've lost a tooth.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.285
How'd it go?

20:11.291 --> 20:13.683
We are still divorced.

20:13.689 --> 20:15.221
Way to keep at it.

20:15.227 --> 20:16.460
What are you doing?

20:16.628 --> 20:18.741
Me? I'm doing a little shopping

20:18.815 --> 20:21.831
for sperm and purses.
I have two tabs open.

20:21.837 --> 20:24.050
- So we're doing it?
- We're doing it.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.871
Do you think the baby
is gonna be pissed

20:25.877 --> 20:27.197
that it doesn't have a dad?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.774
- I'll be the dad.
- Yeah?

20:29.780 --> 20:31.104
Hell yeah.

20:31.393 --> 20:32.892
Okay, cool.

20:32.993 --> 20:34.894
And speaking of cool,

20:34.900 --> 20:38.761
um, can we take a picture of me
signing my semen-purchaser agreement?

20:39.259 --> 20:42.539
Duh. We're gonna need
it for the baby book.

20:42.545 --> 20:43.761
Oh, yeah.

20:46.664 --> 20:48.367
- Okay.
- Here we go.
