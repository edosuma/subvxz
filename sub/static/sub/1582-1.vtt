08:29.822 --> 08:30.956

(grunts)

09:43.362 --> 09:44.963
(humming happily)

09:54.106 --> 09:56.575
Something happened to Dad
on that trip.

09:56.609 --> 09:58.410
This is worse than when he went
to New Orleans

09:58.411 --> 10:00.712
and came back
with a Southern accent.

10:00.746 --> 10:03.215

Uh, how y'all doin'?

10:03.249 --> 10:05.417

10:06.419 --> 10:08.887
(dog barking in distance)

10:08.921 --> 10:11.321
Chief Wiggum, how come every
time there's a terrorist chatter

10:11.324 --> 10:13.725
in this town, you come to me?
Lay off, Apu.

10:13.759 --> 10:15.727
When I look at people,
I don't see colors.

10:15.761 --> 10:18.630
I just see crackpot religions.
Chief, is there

10:18.664 --> 10:21.066
really a terrorist threat
to Springfield?

10:21.100 --> 10:24.469
Yeah. I got
a very important phone call.

10:24.503 --> 10:26.271
(phone rings)
Yello?

10:26.305 --> 10:28.106
MAN:
Is this line secure?

10:28.140 --> 10:30.775
Uh, it's a little jiggly
but it'll hold.

10:30.810 --> 10:34.613
We got intel-- uh, that's short
for a word I don't know...

10:34.647 --> 10:36.781
Intelligence?
I don't believe so, no.

10:36.816 --> 10:40.886
Anyway, this intel says that
someone in town has been turned

10:40.920 --> 10:43.488
and they're working for terrorists.
(gasps)

10:43.522 --> 10:46.391
Now, I got to go check
my other suspects.

10:46.425 --> 10:48.226
Uh-huh.

10:48.261 --> 10:50.362
But I may be back.

10:53.599 --> 10:56.101

10:56.135 --> 10:59.104
(gasps)
Dad's kneeling on a prayer mat.

10:59.138 --> 11:01.773
He doesn't believe in kneeling.

11:01.807 --> 11:05.443
(chanting indistinctly)

11:05.478 --> 11:08.513
Huh? It looks like he's praying.

11:09.548 --> 11:12.117
To the east. The Middle East.

11:12.151 --> 11:13.785
Mecca.

11:20.793 --> 11:22.894

11:29.702 --> 11:31.937
If you are a cat, prove it.

11:39.312 --> 11:41.346
Okay then.

11:41.380 --> 11:42.714
(humming happily)

11:46.319 --> 11:48.887
Mom, I have to tell you
something about Dad,

11:48.921 --> 11:50.121
something big!

11:50.156 --> 11:53.491
I know. He's changed.

11:53.526 --> 11:54.559
Exactly.

11:54.593 --> 11:55.794
For the better.

11:55.828 --> 11:57.362
And men don't
change that way.

11:57.396 --> 11:58.069
But-but...

11:58.094 --> 11:59.831
Do you know what
we're doing on Sunday?

11:59.832 --> 12:02.367
Brunch with the Hibberts.
Then the tile store.

12:02.401 --> 12:06.771
He's like a husband
in a widow's memory-- perfect.

12:06.806 --> 12:09.407
(grunting)

12:09.442 --> 12:11.409
Perfect.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.678
Perfect.

12:18.384 --> 12:21.586
(beeping)

12:21.620 --> 12:23.922
(phone rings)
FBI.

12:23.956 --> 12:26.157
I think someone I love
is a terrorist.

12:26.192 --> 12:27.759
Does that make me crazy?

12:27.793 --> 12:29.761
No, no. Not at all.

12:29.795 --> 12:32.764
It took me two hours to get
home. Traffic was <i>crazy.</i>

12:32.798 --> 12:34.599
Are you people
talking about me?

12:34.633 --> 12:36.768
No. We're not even
here right now.

12:47.813 --> 12:49.781
742 Evergreen Terrace.
I'll be right there.

12:49.815 --> 12:51.716
And don't believe what
you've heard about me.

12:51.751 --> 12:54.753
I haven't heard anything
about you except from you.

12:56.455 --> 12:59.624
Hanging up
the receiver, eh?

12:59.658 --> 13:01.526
(gasps)
How much did you hear?

13:01.560 --> 13:02.861
How much did you say?

13:02.895 --> 13:03.928
Nothing, really.

13:03.963 --> 13:06.097
So I heard half of nothing.

13:06.132 --> 13:09.134
Dad, you're scary
when you're calm and focused.

13:09.168 --> 13:11.870
Lisa, I'll miss you
when this is all over.

13:11.904 --> 13:13.238
When what's all over?

13:13.272 --> 13:15.240
This conversation.
(chuckles nervously)

13:15.274 --> 13:17.442
See you on the other side.

13:17.476 --> 13:18.777
What other side?

13:18.811 --> 13:20.712
Of the house.
Where the fireplace is.

13:20.746 --> 13:22.447
We're toasting marshmallows.

13:22.481 --> 13:24.215
Marsh...

13:24.250 --> 13:26.451
mallows.

13:37.045 --> 13:39.013
I'm Bart Simpson.
Who the hell are you?

13:39.047 --> 13:40.848
Agent Crawford, FBI.

13:40.882 --> 13:43.083
You guys know I don't talk
to field agents.

13:43.118 --> 13:44.919
Get your boss on the phone.

13:44.953 --> 13:47.554
I'm not here for you.
I'm here for your dad.

13:47.589 --> 13:49.556
What do you want
with his dad?

13:49.591 --> 13:51.191
Go back to
sleep, Milhouse.

13:51.226 --> 13:52.593
How do you know my name?

13:52.627 --> 13:55.129
I didn't. But I do now.

13:56.131 --> 13:58.299
Don't talk.
Okay.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.967
I want you to know
I'm the best there is

14:00.001 --> 14:01.392
at finding out
what you're up to.

14:01.417 --> 14:02.002
Ooh.

14:02.003 --> 14:04.138
I can torture you.
I can give you incredible sex.

14:04.172 --> 14:06.373
Or you can just tell me
what I want to know.

14:06.408 --> 14:07.384
What was the
first one again?

14:07.409 --> 14:08.409
I see.

14:08.410 --> 14:10.210
You're stupid.
Hey.

14:10.245 --> 14:12.212
I'm the one in bed
with two beautiful women.

14:12.247 --> 14:13.213
(gasps)

14:13.248 --> 14:16.150
You think
I'm beautiful? Oh!

14:16.184 --> 14:18.118
In a breaking-and-entering
kind of way.

14:18.153 --> 14:20.120
Well, give me something,
or I'm not leaving.

14:20.155 --> 14:21.889
(snoring)

14:21.923 --> 14:25.326
Let's just say I've got
to get to work on time.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.729
And if you knew me, you'd know
just how odd that sounds.

14:28.763 --> 14:30.597
Who are you
talking to?

14:30.632 --> 14:32.166
No one.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.302
You're in too deep, Annie.
Get out.

14:35.337 --> 14:37.304
Are you real, or my imagination?

14:37.339 --> 14:39.707
Either way,
my advice is sound.

14:41.309 --> 14:43.944
I love my job.

14:43.979 --> 14:48.349

15:05.700 --> 15:07.201
Weird thing

15:07.235 --> 15:09.870
That's what I thought.
Have a good one. (laughs)

15:09.904 --> 15:12.539
You laugh now, but
you won't be laughing soon.

15:12.574 --> 15:14.508
He's right,
because now I go back

15:14.542 --> 15:16.977

15:44.439 --> 15:45.806
(grunts)
Dad?

15:45.840 --> 15:47.474
Huh? How'd you get in here?

15:47.509 --> 15:49.877
Girl Scout cookies
get you in anywhere.

15:49.911 --> 15:51.311
Please don't do this, Dad.

15:51.346 --> 15:53.514
I don't know what horrors
you saw in Boise,

15:53.548 --> 15:55.916
but it's not worth
blowing up everyone you love.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.418
I'm not blowing up the plant.

15:57.452 --> 15:58.819
(chuckling):
Oh.

15:58.853 --> 16:00.254
Just harmlessly stopping it

16:00.288 --> 16:02.723
from doing more damage
to Mother Earth.

16:02.757 --> 16:04.158
Is that something

16:04.192 --> 16:06.093
your terrorist masters
told you to tell me?

16:06.127 --> 16:07.761
(sighs)
Yes.

16:07.796 --> 16:10.998
My terrorist masters are always
talking about you, Lisa.

16:11.032 --> 16:15.302
<i>I missed my flight,</i>
<i>so I got in a van...</i>

16:21.242 --> 16:23.210
<i>...with some eco-friendly</i>
<i>activists.</i>

16:23.244 --> 16:25.345
<i>They wanted gas, grass or ass,</i>

16:25.380 --> 16:27.881
<i>and, brother, I had the ass.</i>

16:27.916 --> 16:30.250
They taught me something
I found shocking.

16:30.285 --> 16:33.387
Pigs aren't happy
to be made into pork chops.

16:33.421 --> 16:35.722
This T-shirt lied to me.

16:35.757 --> 16:39.393
And they also gave me
an alcohol detox.

Oh, I've been listening

16:56.411 --> 16:59.613
and it's only the end
of the first verse!

16:59.647 --> 17:01.882
LISA:
<i>But I saw you praying to Mecca.</i>

17:01.916 --> 17:04.785
Lisa, I've never prayed
to a city in my life,

17:04.819 --> 17:07.721
and if I did, it would be
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

17:07.755 --> 17:10.824
I was kneeling on the
affirmation rug they gave me.

17:11.659 --> 17:13.594
See?

17:13.627 --> 17:15.162
(rhythmically): Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

17:15.195 --> 17:16.597
Ow, this rug is
hard on my knees.

17:16.631 --> 17:17.964
Ow, this rug is hard
on my knees.

17:17.999 --> 17:20.434
But wait, wait, wait.
What is this?

17:20.468 --> 17:22.736
Lisa, the most horrible truth
of all is,

17:22.770 --> 17:26.440
the plant where I work poisons
our water and our air.

17:26.473 --> 17:28.742
I've told you that
a million times.

17:28.776 --> 17:32.446
Aw, sweetie, you told me a
thousand things a million times.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.182
Even with a brain
the size of a dinosaur's,

17:35.216 --> 17:36.950
I couldn't take that in.

17:36.985 --> 17:38.752
Anyhoo, this canister

17:38.786 --> 17:41.822
is full of spoiled milk
and utility-grade chicken,

17:41.856 --> 17:44.458
both sold to me by Apu
this morning.

17:44.492 --> 17:45.826
When I release it

17:45.860 --> 17:47.594
into the AC system,

17:47.629 --> 17:49.930
it'll stink up
the plant forever.

17:49.964 --> 17:53.100
No one can use it,
but no one gets hurt.

17:53.134 --> 17:55.836
Just like
when I smell up the toilet.

17:55.870 --> 17:56.837
(knocking)
(gasps) Huh?

17:56.871 --> 17:58.839
(grunting)

17:58.873 --> 17:59.840
(door opens)

17:59.874 --> 18:00.841
There he is.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.709
Use your fattest handcuffs.

18:02.744 --> 18:04.511
Hey. Uh, it's not
what you think, Lou.

18:04.546 --> 18:05.646
Lou, Lou, Lou.

18:05.680 --> 18:06.647
(ululating):
Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou-Lou...!

18:06.681 --> 18:08.015
(groans)

18:08.049 --> 18:10.117
I can complete my dad's mission

18:10.151 --> 18:12.719
just like George W. Bush.

18:12.754 --> 18:15.522
I can't shoot a little girl.

18:15.557 --> 18:17.124
(gunshot)
Ah, damn it!

18:17.158 --> 18:18.692
There's some things
they just don't teach you

18:18.726 --> 18:22.262
in the police academy... movies.

18:23.331 --> 18:25.632
(distorted grunting)

18:29.737 --> 18:30.704
(electronic trilling)

18:30.738 --> 18:32.172
(rhythmic chugging)

18:33.708 --> 18:35.509
We did it, Dad. We did it.

18:35.543 --> 18:36.877
We sure did.

18:36.911 --> 18:37.878
(grunts)

18:37.912 --> 18:40.180
You weren't shot.

18:40.215 --> 18:42.916
No, I was just up late
watching a movie.

18:42.951 --> 18:45.719
Something with
William Holden and...

18:45.753 --> 18:47.054
(snoring)

18:51.926 --> 18:53.894
Your plan failed.

18:53.928 --> 18:55.249
Thank God this
plant has never had

18:55.263 --> 18:56.663
a functioning
air conditioner.

18:56.698 --> 18:58.365
Wait a minute, Burns.

18:58.399 --> 19:00.167
You don't have a functioning
AC system at a nuclear plant?

19:00.201 --> 19:01.568
That's against the law.

19:01.603 --> 19:03.203
That's impossible.

19:03.238 --> 19:05.005
Smithers, didn't we move
this plant to China?

19:05.039 --> 19:06.406
Sir, that's two years from now,

19:06.441 --> 19:07.908
and you're not supposed
to tell anyone.

19:07.942 --> 19:08.976
Oopsie.

19:10.712 --> 19:13.113
There isn't a prison made
that can hold me.

19:13.147 --> 19:15.282
Prisons are still made
of mud and wattles, right?

19:15.316 --> 19:18.919
No. Concrete.
(gasps loudly)

19:18.953 --> 19:21.255
You know, Dad, just because
your mission's complete,

19:21.289 --> 19:24.291
it doesn't mean you have
to go back to pork eating

19:24.325 --> 19:26.727
and beer... drinking.

19:26.761 --> 19:28.862
A beer from the sky!

19:28.896 --> 19:31.265
It's a sign!

19:31.299 --> 19:32.699
(laughing)

19:34.068 --> 19:36.036
Yeah, this equipment will pay
for itself

19:36.070 --> 19:37.671
in one night of binging.

19:40.808 --> 19:44.611
I wish a mission could bring me
closer to someone, but it can't.

19:44.646 --> 19:47.748
Okay, it's time for me
to walk alone into the sunset.

19:48.983 --> 19:50.384
(gulps loudly)

19:50.418 --> 19:51.985
That's better.

19:57.158 --> 19:59.593

20:13.232 --> 20:16.234

older than I am.
