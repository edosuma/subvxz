00:00.290 --> 00:02.057
Previously on
"Criminal Minds"...

00:02.116 --> 00:04.905
I got her!
No, no, no. No, Emily.

00:04.973 --> 00:07.767
Stay with me.
Come on, stay with me.

00:07.835 --> 00:09.401
Where's my medic?!

00:09.468 --> 00:12.880
She never made it
off the table.

00:12.948 --> 00:14.916
I didn't get a chance
to say good-bye.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.885
Penelope, you gotta stop
staring at her.

00:18.952 --> 00:20.119
I can't help it.

00:22.487 --> 00:25.228
You know everyone's feeling it
and nobody wants to talk about it.

00:25.296 --> 00:27.364
It's too soon, Aaron.

00:27.432 --> 00:30.907
Doesn't Strauss usually
run these assessments?

00:30.975 --> 00:34.215
There was no way
that was gonna happen.

00:34.282 --> 00:36.286
Internalizing
does make it worse.

00:36.353 --> 00:39.325
I'll talk, but I don't want to
talk about her being gone.

00:39.393 --> 00:42.095
It's like if we can't
keep each other safe,

00:42.163 --> 00:44.097
then why are we even
doing any of this?

00:44.165 --> 00:45.932
If I had just gotten there
60 seconds earlier,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.901
Emily might still
be with us.

00:47.969 --> 00:49.168
Derek, you know that you did
everything you could.

00:49.236 --> 00:50.837
So where does that leave me?

00:50.904 --> 00:52.272
Angry.

00:52.340 --> 00:54.841
You know, we, um,
we come in here

00:54.908 --> 00:57.276
and we talk to you.

00:57.344 --> 00:59.379
Where do you go?

01:13.443 --> 01:14.879
Dude, when she's trapped
in the ceiling

01:14.931 --> 01:16.332
and those cuts just appear.

01:16.452 --> 01:18.655
Dude. Classic horror.

01:18.723 --> 01:20.557
Cheesy special effects,
but, damn, you were scared.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.026
Nice.

01:22.094 --> 01:24.663
Unnecessary. There's too much
blood and gore and eew.

01:24.731 --> 01:25.897
Garcia, it's a slasher film.

01:25.965 --> 01:28.033
How do you do a slasher
film without violence?

01:28.101 --> 01:30.069
You imply it. Baby, the movie
is called "Slice 6."

01:30.137 --> 01:31.237
What were you expecting?

01:31.305 --> 01:33.639
A refreshing beverage
with a twist of comedy.

01:33.707 --> 01:35.474
I'm gonna have nightmares
for a week.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.476
With everything that we do
and see on a daily basis,

01:37.544 --> 01:39.011
that got to you?

01:39.078 --> 01:42.481
Listen, newb, you may be all
Sigourney Weaver ass-kicking tough,

01:42.548 --> 01:45.283
which is awesome, but the mystical
mavens of innocence like myself

01:45.351 --> 01:47.352
jump at things that
go bump in the night.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.255
Why are you worried? I'm sure
that Morgan will protect you.

01:49.322 --> 01:50.563
As long as he's not jumping
out of his chair like

01:50.588 --> 01:51.788
a prepubescent schoolgirl.

01:51.959 --> 01:54.061
The only reason I jumped
is 'cause you guys woke me up.

01:54.129 --> 01:55.596
How could you sleep
during that?

01:55.664 --> 01:57.821
Easy. You drag me out
after a 12-hour workday--

01:57.846 --> 01:58.632
for what?

01:58.633 --> 02:00.100
You telling me that girl
didn't know that the unsub

02:00.168 --> 02:01.535
was waiting for her upstairs?
Come on, now.

02:01.603 --> 02:03.070
What?
Villain.

02:03.138 --> 02:05.340
In movies, unsubs
are called villains.

02:05.407 --> 02:08.043
My bad.

02:08.110 --> 02:10.012
You want to know why horror
movies are so successful?

02:10.113 --> 02:11.547
Why is that, genius?

02:11.615 --> 02:13.850
They prey on our
instinctual need to survive.

02:13.918 --> 02:16.620
In tribal days, a woman's
scream would signal danger

02:16.688 --> 02:19.324
and the men would return from
hunting to protect their pack.

02:19.392 --> 02:20.825
That's why it's always
the women and not the men

02:20.893 --> 02:22.527
who fall victim
to the bogeyman.

02:22.595 --> 02:24.062
Count on you, Reid, to
break a movie down to science.

02:24.130 --> 02:26.365
My favorite thing
about horror movies

02:26.466 --> 02:28.133
is the suspense factor.

02:28.201 --> 02:29.835
Ah, the ticking clock.

02:29.903 --> 02:31.804
The helpless victim
walks through the dark...

02:34.775 --> 02:37.443
Shadows reaching out
to get her.

02:39.479 --> 02:42.781
A sudden noise
draws her attention.

02:42.849 --> 02:46.720
Is someone there,
or is it just in her head?

02:51.827 --> 02:54.095
Still,
it's totally unrealistic.

02:54.163 --> 02:56.765
No one should be walking through
a dark alley by themselves at night.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.434
Ahem. Hello.

02:58.501 --> 03:00.269
Ah. No one should be
walking through a dark alley

03:00.337 --> 03:03.106
without a Derek Morgan
by their side.

03:03.173 --> 03:05.041
But the best part
of a horror movie--

03:05.109 --> 03:07.845
you never know when
the end is gonna come.

03:07.912 --> 03:10.314
Damn it.

05:08.508 --> 05:11.376
What we didn't see coming is the
slicer's brother was in the closet.

05:11.444 --> 05:12.544
Frightening.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.546
His betrayal consumed him
and he sent his brother

05:14.613 --> 05:16.581
to his own private hell.

05:16.648 --> 05:19.116
Speaking of horror...

05:19.184 --> 05:20.551
What's Strauss doing here?

05:20.618 --> 05:23.787
Whatever it is, I cast my vote
on "not good."

05:25.790 --> 05:29.059
I was expecting the grief
assessments yesterday.

05:29.127 --> 05:30.728
I left them on your desk
last night.

05:30.796 --> 05:32.230
Oh, well, good.

05:32.297 --> 05:36.067
The next step, your team
will be observed in the field.

05:36.135 --> 05:39.071
This really isn't the time
for another evaluation.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.739
When is a good time?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.742
You've decided this without
reading the assessments?

05:42.809 --> 05:44.577
Is there something
that I should know?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.746
No, it's just that
everyone grieves differently

05:46.813 --> 05:48.247
and this team
is no exception.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.582
All right, fine.
I will look at your findings,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.151
but just know that there
will be another review.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.586
When do you leave
for San Diego?

05:54.654 --> 05:55.954
As soon as we present
the case.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.522
Good.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.993
Let's get started.

06:01.060 --> 06:02.161
Ok.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.597
Monica Shanley,
Natalie Wallace, Amber Lasko.

06:05.664 --> 06:08.099
3 college students killed
in their off-campus apartments

06:08.167 --> 06:09.468
in the last 5 days.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.837
Two were going to San Diego
Coastal University,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.605
one was going to San Diego Tech.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.507
Well, the unsub definitely has a type.
They could all be related.

06:15.575 --> 06:17.443
Yeah, what he said.
They're all in their early 20s,

06:17.510 --> 06:19.644
brunette, majoring in education

06:19.712 --> 06:21.113
and/or child development.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.848
Is there any indication
that they knew one another?

06:22.916 --> 06:23.983
As it stands right now,

06:24.050 --> 06:25.184
I'm coming up empty.
Their apartments

06:25.252 --> 06:26.952
were spread throughout
the city, so...

06:27.020 --> 06:28.855
No fingerprints at the crime scene.
The unsub uses gloves.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.023
He's organized.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.025
Forced entry
at all the apartments.

06:32.093 --> 06:34.361
Back door, patio door,
living room window.

06:34.429 --> 06:36.163
The homes were wrecked.
Clear evidence of a struggle.

06:36.231 --> 06:37.498
He's creating a scene.

06:37.566 --> 06:39.567
He wants to inflict fear
not only in his victim

06:39.634 --> 06:41.135
but in whomever finds
the body.

06:41.203 --> 06:43.604
Could be a message
to the local P.D.

06:43.672 --> 06:45.406
"Look what I can do."

06:48.776 --> 06:50.710
He's killed 3 women
in under a week.

06:50.778 --> 06:55.314
In all likelihood, he's hunting
for his fourth victim now.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.883
San Diego P.D. wants us
on the scene as soon as possible.

"sometimes human places

07:50.872 --> 07:53.241
Our unsub has a type
and a temper.

07:53.308 --> 07:55.876
Amber was getting ready
for her bath.

07:55.944 --> 07:58.679
It would have been an easy target
for a sexual assault, but none came.

07:58.747 --> 08:01.182
That's highly unusual behavior
for this kind of unsub.

08:01.249 --> 08:03.417
You know, extreme violence
in physical aggression

08:03.485 --> 08:04.785
is in its nature sexual.

08:04.853 --> 08:07.087
That's true, but as
a substitution for the sex act.

08:07.155 --> 08:08.756
This guy could be impotent.

08:08.823 --> 08:11.091
He can't perform, so that's why
he goes all out for the kill.

08:11.159 --> 08:13.094
If he's targeting
female college students,

08:13.162 --> 08:15.129
we need to make sure
that campus officials

08:15.197 --> 08:16.864
are informed if they
haven't been already.

08:16.932 --> 08:18.766
We also can't rule out
other students and faculty.

08:18.834 --> 08:21.269
You know, San Diego's
essentially one big college town,

08:21.337 --> 08:22.704
with an enrollment at SDCU

08:22.771 --> 08:24.372
of approximately
65,000 students.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.908
San Diego county
has 9 universities--

08:26.976 --> 08:28.477
5 private, 4 public.

08:28.544 --> 08:30.445
We add 7 more if we're
including trade schools.

08:30.513 --> 08:31.780
Each girl lived off-campus

08:31.848 --> 08:33.682
and was attacked
in their apartment.

08:33.783 --> 08:35.417
That's pretty high-risk.

08:35.484 --> 08:37.284
Less risky if he's
stalking them in advance,

08:37.352 --> 08:39.287
running layouts
and routines.

08:39.355 --> 08:41.056
Between classes
and part-time jobs,

08:41.123 --> 08:42.991
they'd be home
sporadically at best.

08:43.058 --> 08:44.826
Which tells us they're
not victims of opportunity.

08:44.894 --> 08:46.161
He targets them,
then stalks them

08:46.229 --> 08:48.396
to know where they live and when
they're gonna be alone.

08:48.464 --> 08:50.599
Morgan, you and Reid go to
the last victim's apartment.

08:50.666 --> 08:52.533
Seaver, interview the roommate.

08:52.601 --> 08:55.669
Dave and I will go
to the medical examiner's.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.007
Well, there's
no secure parking.

09:01.075 --> 09:03.276
I rode a bike
when I was in college.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.377
That's 'cause you weren't
old enough to drive, Einstein.

09:05.445 --> 09:06.945
I could drive.
It's just the government

09:07.013 --> 09:08.581
wouldn't issue me a license
until I was 14.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.483
A lot of places
for the unsub to hide out here.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.951
Yeah, he could have
easily grabbed her

09:13.052 --> 09:15.120
when she passed
through here.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.589
Yet she made it all the way
to her apartment.

09:17.657 --> 09:20.125
Where she should feel safe,
but then he took that from her.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.749
All of the women have defensive
wounds on the arms.

09:24.774 --> 09:25.974
They put up a fight.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.500
The number of stab wounds
increases with each victim, yes?

09:28.568 --> 09:31.503
Yes. On Monica Shanley,
the wounds show hesitation.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.738
And the fatal blow
is directly to the heart.

09:33.805 --> 09:35.439
Did the strike indicate

09:35.507 --> 09:38.943
any medical knowledge on
the part of the unsub?

09:39.011 --> 09:41.312
Truthfully,
I think he got lucky.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.780
He hadn't built
his confidence yet.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.016
Yeah, but by the time
he gets to his third kill,

09:45.083 --> 09:47.818
he knows what he's doing.

09:47.886 --> 09:49.186
More direct cuts.

09:49.254 --> 09:51.422
She died from massive
blood loss.

09:51.489 --> 09:53.357
He's improving quickly.

09:53.425 --> 09:56.994
He made the struggle last longer
because he wanted her to suffer.

09:57.062 --> 09:59.730
So now he's starting
to enjoy it.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.041
I'm Agent Derek Morgan.

10:12.109 --> 10:13.709
This is
Dr. Spencer Reid.

10:13.777 --> 10:15.244
Detective Bryce Harding.

10:15.312 --> 10:17.679
Amber's roommate Michelle
told us she was out of town

10:17.747 --> 10:19.781
visiting family when
the attack occurred.

10:19.849 --> 10:22.350
The unsub must have known that.
That's why he made his move last night.

10:22.417 --> 10:24.285
He jimmied the lock
on the window.

10:24.352 --> 10:26.020
I guess he needed the privacy
to complete the torture.

10:26.087 --> 10:29.589
Well, most sadists like
to kill on their own turf.

10:29.657 --> 10:32.159
This guy didn't risk taking her
to a secondary location.

10:32.226 --> 10:33.660
Maybe something happened
which makes the location of

10:33.685 --> 10:35.085
the kill significant. Look.

10:35.229 --> 10:38.064
That's something new.
He's smearing blood on the walls,

10:38.132 --> 10:39.832
exhibiting more control
and rage

10:39.900 --> 10:43.436
over his victims, taking
pleasure in the kill.

10:43.504 --> 10:46.105
What's with the specific
physical type?

10:46.172 --> 10:48.808
It looks like he's taking his anger out
on women who represent someone he knows.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.143
Yeah,
like Edmund Kemper.

10:50.210 --> 10:52.045
He most likely can't confront
his true target yet,

10:52.113 --> 10:53.447
so he's going after
women who look like her

10:53.514 --> 10:57.551
until he can build up the
confidence to complete his endgame.

11:31.752 --> 11:34.820
Sorry about that.
What can I get you?

11:35.956 --> 11:38.257
I should have been there
to help her.

11:38.325 --> 11:41.193
Amber and I were friends
since the third grade.

11:41.261 --> 11:43.028
Always inseparable.

11:43.096 --> 11:45.430
She got into San Diego
Coastal first.

11:45.498 --> 11:48.200
I was so pissed.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.868
I didn't talk to her
for a week.

11:49.936 --> 11:54.940
And then 2 days later
my acceptance letter came in the mail.

11:55.008 --> 11:56.375
It's ok, Michelle.

11:56.442 --> 11:58.076
It's not that I wasn't
happy for her,

11:58.144 --> 11:59.377
I just wanted to go, too.

11:59.445 --> 12:01.580
I know. It's a completely
normal reaction.

12:01.648 --> 12:03.315
But I need you to think,

12:03.382 --> 12:06.185
had any new people come
into her life recently?

12:06.253 --> 12:07.486
Not that I know of.

12:07.554 --> 12:09.488
I had to twist her arm
to get her out.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.357
So she wasn't into
the college scene.

12:11.424 --> 12:13.525
She could party
with the best of them.

12:13.593 --> 12:15.395
She just worked her ass off.

12:15.462 --> 12:16.829
Academically
or for money?

12:16.897 --> 12:19.833
Money. If it wasn't
dog-walking at 10 bucks an hour,

12:19.901 --> 12:22.870
it was house-sitting
or proofreading. She kept busy.

12:22.937 --> 12:25.039
So she took on
a lot of odd jobs.

12:25.107 --> 12:29.075
She wasn't a rich kid
from Orange County.

12:29.143 --> 12:31.344
Do you know where she heard
about the part-time work?

12:31.412 --> 12:32.612
Everywhere.

12:32.679 --> 12:35.047
Coffeehouses, craigslist,
the student center.

12:35.115 --> 12:36.582
You name it.

12:36.649 --> 12:38.583
Thank you.

12:38.651 --> 12:40.118
The first victim
Monica Shanley's bff

12:40.186 --> 12:42.253
reported that they were talking
on the phone and hung up

12:42.321 --> 12:44.455
just before Monica
stepped inside her apartment.

12:44.523 --> 12:45.690
What does that get us?

12:45.758 --> 12:47.992
Well, some neighbors heard
loud screaming

12:48.060 --> 12:50.195
coming from Monica's
apartment at 11:12 p.m.

12:50.262 --> 12:52.097
At 11:15 they called 911.

12:52.165 --> 12:53.865
11:26 cops arrived.

12:53.933 --> 12:57.470
He's able to strike, kill, and
get out in less than 14 minutes?

12:57.537 --> 12:58.504
How'd it go?

12:58.572 --> 12:59.872
According to her roommate,

12:59.940 --> 13:01.875
Amber worked odd jobs
to make ends meet.

13:01.942 --> 13:03.877
Could be where she made
contact with the unsub.

13:03.945 --> 13:07.647
Garcia, get us a list of jobs that
Amber worked the last few months,

13:07.715 --> 13:10.650
and look for personal checks she might
have deposited as under-the-table payments.

13:10.718 --> 13:11.651
Copy that.

13:11.719 --> 13:13.653
The unsub
stalks his victims.

13:13.721 --> 13:15.321
He knows their routine.

13:15.389 --> 13:18.991
He could attack them anytime
they're alone, even in their cars,

13:19.059 --> 13:20.993
but he chooses to attack
them in their homes.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.495
And waits for them
to bolt the doors before he strikes.

13:23.563 --> 13:26.164
He wants them to feel safe
before he takes that away from them.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.701
It's about making them feel
powerless in their own personal space.

13:28.768 --> 13:31.037
So it's physical
and psychological torture.

13:31.105 --> 13:33.206
If he keeps to his
accelerated timetable,

13:33.274 --> 13:34.908
he'll strike tonight.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.696
Hello, guy.

15:01.764 --> 15:04.599
You ok?

15:06.202 --> 15:09.304
Is that you making
all that noise? Hm?

15:09.372 --> 15:11.240
You're so adorable.

15:11.307 --> 15:14.376
You want to pose
for the camera?

15:39.457 --> 15:41.025
Everything's untouched,
as requested.

15:41.093 --> 15:43.461
Vic's name is Laurie Burgin,
student at San Diego Tech.

15:43.529 --> 15:45.197
She was babysitting.

15:45.264 --> 15:47.533
We profiled that he gets off by
striking inside the victims' homes.

15:47.601 --> 15:48.701
Why did he kill her here?

15:48.768 --> 15:50.035
That's a big change
in M.O.

15:50.103 --> 15:51.870
Maybe Laurie had a roommate,
so the unsub figured

15:51.938 --> 15:53.205
he'd have more time
on the job.

15:53.273 --> 15:54.540
Did he hurt the child?

15:54.607 --> 15:56.542
Kid was crying in the crib when
the family got home.

15:56.609 --> 15:59.411
I'll talk to them.
You two go on in.

15:59.479 --> 16:03.149
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins,
I'm David Rossi with the FBI.

16:03.217 --> 16:04.918
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

16:04.985 --> 16:06.385
Of course.
Whatever you need.

16:06.453 --> 16:08.521
Now, was Laurie
a family friend?

16:08.588 --> 16:09.588
No.

16:09.656 --> 16:10.823
We're new to the area.

16:10.891 --> 16:13.192
We haven't had time
to make friends yet.

16:13.260 --> 16:15.694
Online. Craigslist.
And how did you meet her?

16:15.762 --> 16:17.529
I told him not to do it.

16:17.597 --> 16:19.331
I didn't have a choice.

16:19.399 --> 16:22.334
We both work.
I looked into nanny services,

16:22.402 --> 16:24.536
but the start-up costs
were ridiculous.

16:24.604 --> 16:26.537
How many people
did you interview?

16:26.605 --> 16:27.538
I lost count.

16:27.606 --> 16:29.840
She seemed like
the right fit.

16:29.908 --> 16:33.010
She was a college student,
didn't party too much.

16:33.078 --> 16:34.545
She was a hard worker.

16:34.613 --> 16:36.581
And little Julian
loved her.

16:36.648 --> 16:39.250
Did she talk about
any boyfriends

16:39.318 --> 16:42.253
or say anything that may
have raised an alarm?

16:42.321 --> 16:43.688
Not that I can think of.

16:43.756 --> 16:47.092
She was single. She had a boyfriend
back in Tennessee,

16:47.160 --> 16:48.360
but they broke up.

16:48.428 --> 16:50.429
And how long ago
was that?

16:50.497 --> 16:52.331
A month, I think.

16:52.399 --> 16:54.200
I'm not sure.

16:54.268 --> 16:56.001
Thank you.

16:56.069 --> 16:59.672
With an infant in the room, Laurie
would have been at her most vulnerable.

16:59.740 --> 17:01.040
Look at this.

17:01.108 --> 17:05.444
He felt compelled
to organize the supplies.

17:05.512 --> 17:06.780
Look.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.355
Do you think the unsub
fed the kid?

17:15.422 --> 17:19.525
Then he stabs Laurie, so the
kid probably started crying.

17:19.593 --> 17:21.992
Maybe he gave the kid the
bottle in order to keep him quiet.

17:22.060 --> 17:25.463
What kind of an unsub stops
murdering to care for an infant?

17:25.531 --> 17:27.531
One who identifies
with the child.

17:27.599 --> 17:29.034
We might be looking
for someone

17:29.102 --> 17:30.669
with a deep-rooted
abandonment issue.

17:30.737 --> 17:32.504
Or maybe the baby crying
interfered with his enjoyment

17:32.572 --> 17:34.506
of watching
the babysitter bleed out?

17:34.574 --> 17:36.175
Well, either way,
caring for the child

17:36.242 --> 17:38.877
would be psychological
torture for Laurie.

17:42.082 --> 17:44.216
Reid.

17:44.284 --> 17:45.751
Look at that.

17:45.819 --> 17:47.854
She's got several missed calls
and a few text messages

17:47.921 --> 17:50.190
from social networking sites.

17:52.226 --> 17:54.761
"What's with the photo?
Halloween isn't for months."

17:54.829 --> 17:56.729
Speak, boy wonder,
behold my might.

17:56.797 --> 17:58.298
Garcia, the latest
victim Laurie Burgin

17:58.366 --> 18:00.466
was writing something
on the Internet last night.

18:00.534 --> 18:01.868
Can you figure out
what it was?

18:01.936 --> 18:04.938
Yeah. I was just tweeting
myself. Uno momento.

18:13.381 --> 18:14.714
Oh, God.

18:14.782 --> 18:16.516
Reid.

18:16.584 --> 18:19.452
She managed to take a picture
of the unsub before she died.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.987
Can't really
make it out.

18:21.055 --> 18:22.989
I can tell you more.
Laurie's account was active

18:23.057 --> 18:24.324
2 hours after that photo
was posted.

18:24.392 --> 18:26.960
Well, there's no record
of her calling 911.

18:27.028 --> 18:29.028
He must have uploaded
the image himself.

18:29.096 --> 18:31.498
And continued posting
status updates

18:31.565 --> 18:32.632
after she died.

18:32.700 --> 18:35.001
"Feeling faint at heart."

18:35.102 --> 18:36.435
"All alone
and too scared to cry."

18:36.503 --> 18:38.637
All right, this isn't good.

18:38.705 --> 18:40.606
He's mocking his victims now.

18:40.674 --> 18:42.708
He sat here tweeting
while Laurie bled to death.

18:42.775 --> 18:44.376
All right, baby girl,
listen.

18:44.443 --> 18:46.311
I need you to go through
Laurie's accounts.

18:46.379 --> 18:49.281
See who was following her
and see who was messaging back.

18:49.349 --> 18:50.883
On it.
All right, let's get out of here,

18:50.951 --> 18:53.052
let's get back to Hotch.
We got a photo and we got a profile.

18:53.120 --> 18:54.587
Thank you, Garcia.

18:56.924 --> 18:58.992
We're looking for a white
male in his early 20s.

18:59.060 --> 19:00.293
And because he's
stalking his victims,

19:00.361 --> 19:02.196
we believe that he either
works out of his house

19:02.264 --> 19:04.031
or a part-time job.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.900
This unsub strikes
in the home rather than outside

19:05.968 --> 19:07.902
where he could more easily
abduct his victims.

19:07.969 --> 19:10.371
Now, this tells us that his
social skills are most likely lacking

19:10.439 --> 19:12.706
and he may not have
the confidence to talk to women.

19:12.774 --> 19:15.342
His confidence with killing,
however, is growing.

19:15.410 --> 19:17.511
He's gone from hesitant
strikes in the victim's home

19:17.579 --> 19:19.747
to painting the walls
with blood.

19:19.814 --> 19:22.783
Our unsub is developing
a taste for the kill.

19:22.851 --> 19:25.352
And his victims share
similar features and backgrounds.

19:25.420 --> 19:26.921
And we believe that
they represent someone

19:26.988 --> 19:29.189
whom the unsub thinks
has wronged him

19:29.257 --> 19:30.657
and he's taking out
his rage on them.

19:30.725 --> 19:33.226
Because the unsub shows
signs of one neat aspect

19:33.327 --> 19:35.628
and started killing suddenly
and effectively with no break,

19:35.696 --> 19:38.564
we believe he was recently
incarcerated or institutionalized.

19:38.632 --> 19:40.233
Look at men who got out
a month or so ago.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.902
Their records will show
a history of violence,

19:42.970 --> 19:46.572
anger toward women
and/or symbols of authority.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.875
We need to warn
all young women to be hypervigilant,

19:48.942 --> 19:51.210
especially in their
online acquaintances,

19:51.278 --> 19:54.180
but also with service workers,
maintenance staff, and deliverymen.

19:54.248 --> 19:57.716
Are we telling college girls not to let
people in uniforms into their homes?

19:57.784 --> 19:59.318
No, but tell them
to double-check I.D.s,

19:59.386 --> 20:01.387
call dispatch before
they let anybody inside.

20:01.454 --> 20:02.921
How do we avoid
inciting panic?

20:02.989 --> 20:05.791
Panic is inevitable, but we still
need to keep everyone informed.

20:05.859 --> 20:08.193
Uniformed officers are posting
warnings across campuses.

20:08.261 --> 20:10.229
Now, since the Jenkins
family found Laurie online,

20:10.297 --> 20:12.064
we believe the unsub
may be using similar methods--

20:12.132 --> 20:15.201
profiles, job postings, anything that
gives a little too much information

20:15.269 --> 20:17.804
that the unsub could use
to hunt his victims.

20:17.872 --> 20:19.305
And time's
not on our side.

20:19.373 --> 20:21.876
We think that he's already
got his next victim in his sights.

20:33.455 --> 20:36.290
The account tracks back
to an email address

20:36.357 --> 20:40.693
he created yesterday morning,
I.P. address leads to a public terminal.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.761
That's where the trail ends.

20:41.829 --> 20:42.995
What about
at the Jenkins house?

20:43.063 --> 20:44.496
He was tweeting with her
prior to the assault.

20:44.564 --> 20:47.032
The unsub hacked into
the Jenkins' Wi-Fi network.

20:47.100 --> 20:49.234
Pretty smart for a guy
who's been locked up.

20:49.302 --> 20:51.303
Yeah, he has gotten good
at covering his tracks.

20:51.371 --> 20:54.006
How are you doing on a list
of criminal records and releases?

20:54.074 --> 20:55.441
Oh, right, that. Ok.

20:55.509 --> 20:57.310
I searched local college
students, which is a lot,

20:57.377 --> 21:00.313
and I'm a masochist, so I went
ahead and included military personnel

21:00.380 --> 21:03.716
because San Diego has a big
naval and marine presence.

21:03.783 --> 21:07.186
Combine those two pools and
he's swimming in criminal infractions.

21:07.254 --> 21:09.621
All right, filter out
sexual assault and lewd behavior.

21:09.689 --> 21:11.390
Filtering at the speed
of tech, sir.

21:11.458 --> 21:13.659
And what about background
financials on the victims?

21:13.727 --> 21:16.862
Is there any evidence of jobs
being performed under the table?

21:16.930 --> 21:21.834
Actually, in all cases
there were personal checks

21:21.902 --> 21:25.037
deposited from several accounts,
most under $100.

21:25.105 --> 21:27.239
All right, send a list
of account holders, and, Seaver,

21:27.307 --> 21:29.041
when you get them,
start making phone calls.

21:29.109 --> 21:30.375
What am I looking for?

21:30.443 --> 21:32.377
Any victims who might have
worked as babysitters.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.516
Yes, ma'am.

21:37.584 --> 21:39.218
How's it going?

21:39.286 --> 21:41.887
We've delivered the profile
and the locals are canvassing the area.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.222
Any leads?

21:43.289 --> 21:44.723
Did you call
for a field update?

21:44.791 --> 21:45.958
No.

21:46.026 --> 21:49.327
I've been reviewing
your grief assessments,

21:49.395 --> 21:50.995
and they're incomplete.

21:51.063 --> 21:52.230
How's that?

21:52.297 --> 21:54.332
Yours isn't there.

21:54.399 --> 21:56.700
My orders
were to assess the team.

21:56.768 --> 21:58.702
You don't think
the mental state

21:58.770 --> 22:01.238
of your team's leader
is relevant?

22:01.305 --> 22:04.006
You need to talk
to someone, too.

22:04.074 --> 22:05.508
Is that an order?

22:05.576 --> 22:08.711
If that's the only way
you'll do it, yes.

22:08.779 --> 22:10.914
Ma'am, with all due respect,
we've got 4 women dead

22:10.981 --> 22:13.917
and we'll probably have another one
by the morning.

22:13.985 --> 22:16.821
Find me
when you get back.

22:16.888 --> 22:18.756
She's relentless.

22:18.824 --> 22:19.857
Tell me about it.

22:19.925 --> 22:21.326
Can I help with anything?

22:21.394 --> 22:23.963
No, I'm good. Thanks.

22:27.301 --> 22:30.103
All those dead girls
look just like you, sweetheart.

22:30.170 --> 22:31.904
You don't think
I realize that?

22:31.972 --> 22:34.373
That last girl,
I could be her sister.

22:35.509 --> 22:37.109
What was that?

22:37.177 --> 22:39.879
Kill. Kill. Kill!

22:39.947 --> 22:41.347
Ok, that is so not funny.

22:41.415 --> 22:43.116
Aw, come on, relax.

22:43.183 --> 22:44.417
You set the alarm, right?

22:44.485 --> 22:47.452
Um...Yeah, let's just see.

22:47.520 --> 22:48.587
Alarm...

22:48.655 --> 22:49.922
Is...

22:49.989 --> 22:50.922
Set.

22:50.990 --> 22:52.758
Kid's asleep.

22:52.826 --> 22:54.326
Come over?

22:54.394 --> 22:56.428
I can't. I got a paper
due in the morning.

22:56.496 --> 22:57.930
I'll write it for you.

22:57.998 --> 22:59.265
Yeah, just get over--
really?

23:02.935 --> 23:04.002
Wait.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.337
What's wrong, Lily?

23:06.472 --> 23:07.406
Um...

23:07.474 --> 23:09.575
What is it?

23:09.643 --> 23:11.844
Something just triggered
the alarm.

23:11.912 --> 23:13.679
Can you stay on the phone?

23:13.747 --> 23:15.348
Yeah, ok.

23:15.416 --> 23:16.883
Lily. Lily?

23:18.185 --> 23:19.887
Oh, my God!

23:19.954 --> 23:22.456
Lily! What's wrong, Lily?
Sorry, um--

23:22.524 --> 23:23.758
the Ellisons are back.
I gotta go.

23:23.826 --> 23:25.526
Sorry. We just came in
from the garage.

23:25.594 --> 23:27.195
No, sorry. I'm just
a little on edge.

23:27.262 --> 23:28.563
We should have called first.

23:28.630 --> 23:29.697
You're home early.

23:29.765 --> 23:31.332
Well, someone was bored.

23:31.399 --> 23:33.434
Says the man who snored
and attracted the attention

23:33.501 --> 23:35.469
of everyone around us.

23:35.537 --> 23:37.037
How's the little one?

23:37.105 --> 23:38.606
Still the best baby ever.

23:38.674 --> 23:42.042
I put him to bed
I think half an hour ago.

23:42.110 --> 23:44.979
Can you be here tomorrow morning
at 8:00 instead of 9:00?

23:45.047 --> 23:46.380
Yeah, sure.
My meeting got moved up.

23:46.448 --> 23:47.548
Do you want to just stay?

23:47.616 --> 23:48.749
No. I'm fine.

23:48.817 --> 23:50.217
Thanks.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.087
See you tomorrow?

23:53.154 --> 23:56.490
Yep. Bright and early.

23:56.558 --> 23:58.591
Aah!

24:14.229 --> 24:15.864
Did he get another
babysitter?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.514
Not just her.

24:17.582 --> 24:18.882
Who's that?

24:18.950 --> 24:21.552
Amy Ellison. She and her son
are the sole survivors.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.020
The housekeeper found them
locked in the nursery.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.522
They were locked
in there all night?

24:24.590 --> 24:26.190
He broke the handle
off the door.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.460
I'll meet you guys inside.

24:29.963 --> 24:32.031
Mrs. Ellison, we'll take him now
and check his vitals.

24:32.098 --> 24:33.566
I'll bring him
right back to you.

24:37.570 --> 24:40.806
Hello, Amy. My name's Derek Morgan.
I'm with the FBI.

24:40.874 --> 24:43.008
I understand you've
been through a great ordeal.

24:43.076 --> 24:45.677
I'd just like to ask you
a few questions if that's all right.

24:45.744 --> 24:47.378
Ok.

24:47.446 --> 24:50.514
Did you happen to see the man
who came in your home?

24:50.582 --> 24:52.549
Only for a couple seconds.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.218
He was wearing a mask.

24:55.286 --> 24:58.155
He rushed right at Jake.

24:58.222 --> 24:59.957
I--I couldn't--

25:00.024 --> 25:01.225
It's ok.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.327
Take your time.

25:03.394 --> 25:07.932
I ran to Jake, but there was
so much blood.

25:07.999 --> 25:11.368
He grabbed Lily and held
the knife to her throat.

25:11.436 --> 25:14.605
He locked me in the nursery
with the baby.

25:14.673 --> 25:18.243
Did you hear anything
while you were locked inside?

25:20.613 --> 25:22.782
Screaming.

25:24.418 --> 25:28.054
Jake suffered multiple stab wounds
to the chest and abdomen.

25:28.122 --> 25:30.190
The sitter Lily
got the brunt of it.

25:30.258 --> 25:34.361
This is the second time
he struck inside someone else's home.

25:34.462 --> 25:37.130
He's telling us something.

25:37.198 --> 25:39.632
He's narrowing in on
his ideal victimology.

25:39.700 --> 25:44.170
Babysitting somehow fits into
the scenario he's trying to recreate.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.675
You know what?
He changed his M.O. as well.

25:48.742 --> 25:50.844
He violated Lily
with a knife.

25:50.911 --> 25:53.713
He hasn't shown aggressive sexual
behavior up till now.

25:53.781 --> 25:54.848
What's different?

25:54.915 --> 25:56.049
This is more personal.

25:56.116 --> 25:58.585
She could be the one
he's been after all along.

25:58.653 --> 26:00.220
I don't know.
This guy's meticulous.

26:00.288 --> 26:01.655
He plans everything out.

26:01.722 --> 26:04.157
Then why didn't he know
the Ellisons were returning?

26:04.225 --> 26:06.326
I think he did. I mean,
the unsub was watching the house.

26:06.394 --> 26:09.162
He knew that they came home,
but he just didn't care. He adapted.

26:09.230 --> 26:11.465
He went after
the biggest threat first.

26:11.532 --> 26:14.702
He eliminated Jake in order
to gain control over Lily and Amy.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.671
There are two initial
points of attack,

26:16.738 --> 26:19.106
one in the hallway
outside the nursery

26:19.174 --> 26:20.941
and the other one here.

26:21.009 --> 26:24.512
Yet, both bodies
ended up together.

26:24.613 --> 26:26.013
Look at the way
they're posed,

26:26.081 --> 26:27.881
directly looking
at each other.

26:27.949 --> 26:29.917
He wanted them
to watch each other die.

26:29.984 --> 26:32.185
I think it's more than that.

26:32.253 --> 26:35.989
This change in behavior
could be the piece that we're missing.

27:12.791 --> 27:15.826
This guy knew the Ellisons were home,
but he struck anyway.

27:15.894 --> 27:17.594
He could have taken out
the entire family,

27:17.662 --> 27:18.929
but he chose to spare the
mother and the child. Why?

27:18.997 --> 27:21.866
With the Jenkins, the unsub
actually fed the baby.

27:21.934 --> 27:24.402
Here, he spared the mother and
locked her in a room with her son.

27:24.470 --> 27:26.905
It's like he's
protecting the children.

27:26.972 --> 27:28.740
The addition of Jake Ellison

27:28.807 --> 27:30.175
caused the unsub to
change his methodology.

27:30.242 --> 27:32.043
For the first time
he posed the bodies,

27:32.111 --> 27:33.878
and he's also sexually violated
one of the victims.

27:33.946 --> 27:38.215
Ok, we have a father
posed to look at a dying babysitter

27:38.283 --> 27:39.917
and a mother and child
protected upstairs.

27:39.984 --> 27:42.019
That's a pretty clear
message.

27:42.086 --> 27:44.922
Garcia, search for local women
who died in their early 30s

27:44.990 --> 27:47.191
and they're survived by a husband
and at least one son.

27:47.258 --> 27:48.993
Go back 10-15 years.

27:49.061 --> 27:50.728
Cross that with
new marriage licenses

27:50.796 --> 27:51.929
filed by surviving husbands.

27:51.997 --> 27:53.631
The unsub's always
been troubled, Garcia,

27:53.698 --> 27:56.700
so look for youthful offenders who would
have fit into the sociopathic triad.

27:56.768 --> 27:59.102
Ok, I've got 30 matches,

27:59.170 --> 28:00.837
which points to a disturbing
social phenomenon

28:00.905 --> 28:02.305
and does not help us
narrow this down.

28:02.373 --> 28:03.873
Ok, so cross-reference that

28:03.940 --> 28:06.708
with your list of newly-released
inmates and mental patients.

28:06.776 --> 28:09.077
Ok, I've got a few.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.946
What about...
Here's one.

28:11.013 --> 28:12.514
Greg Phinney, Chula Vista.

28:12.582 --> 28:15.183
He was put into juvie
when he was 13 for...

28:15.251 --> 28:16.718
threatening his stepmom
with a knife.

28:16.786 --> 28:18.553
What do we know
about the stepmother?

28:18.621 --> 28:21.456
Kate Jones, aka
the second Mrs. Phinney.

28:21.524 --> 28:23.492
Married Greg's father
a year after Greg's mother

28:23.560 --> 28:25.227
was killed in a car accident.

28:25.295 --> 28:27.462
Greg was 11 at the time.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.498
Mr. Phinney died
4 weeks ago.

28:29.565 --> 28:31.733
Is there any evidence that
Kate worked in the Phinney home

28:31.801 --> 28:32.901
before the mother's death?

28:32.969 --> 28:34.236
Oh, the plot solidifies.

28:34.304 --> 28:36.906
Kate cited additional income
as caregiver

28:36.973 --> 28:41.009
on her tax returns when
she was a college student.

28:41.077 --> 28:44.379
Payments trace back
to the Phinneys.

28:44.447 --> 28:46.615
Kate filed numerous reports
against Greg for violent behavior,

28:46.683 --> 28:48.184
experimentation on animals.

28:48.251 --> 28:51.520
Greg's father finally put the kibosh
on things when he was 17,

28:51.588 --> 28:54.090
had him institutionalized.
Greg was released 2 weeks ago.

28:54.157 --> 28:55.491
Just before
the killings started.

28:55.559 --> 28:57.426
Garcia, where's
Greg Phinney now?

28:57.494 --> 28:59.528
Yeah, that's a good question.

29:24.485 --> 29:25.652
Oh, dear--

29:29.356 --> 29:30.423
Hello, Kate.

29:43.265 --> 29:46.468
Greg Phinney, FBI.
Open the door!

29:57.446 --> 29:59.113
He's not in here.
The bedroom's clear.

30:07.655 --> 30:10.556
Baby girl, can you tell me
why Greg Phinney's laptop

30:10.624 --> 30:12.058
has an employee
login screen?

30:12.126 --> 30:14.227
Well, lover, I have been
doing some digging.

30:14.295 --> 30:16.763
Did you know that he's been
working part-time as a data entry clerk

30:16.831 --> 30:18.232
at the "San Diego Register"?

30:18.300 --> 30:20.535
If he was in an institution,
where did he get time to find a job?

30:20.603 --> 30:22.504
Uh, he didn't even have to look.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.773
This job is part of
his work-release program.

30:24.841 --> 30:27.743
And 20 hours of Internet
privileges will go a long way.

30:27.811 --> 30:30.480
That's how he finds his victims.
He browses the classifieds.

30:30.547 --> 30:33.616
Did he have access to the customers'
personal information?

30:33.684 --> 30:35.517
Oh, honey, he entered it.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.087
That must be Kate Phinney.

30:40.155 --> 30:43.424
Well, he's obviously built up
the confidence to confront her.

30:43.492 --> 30:44.425
Garcia.

30:44.493 --> 30:45.994
Reading your mind.
Calling the others.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.829
Stop, please!

30:47.896 --> 30:49.597
Aah!

30:55.303 --> 30:56.270
Do you feel that?

30:56.337 --> 30:57.271
Ohh!

30:57.338 --> 30:58.873
Of course I do.

30:58.940 --> 31:01.775
Not the pain.

31:01.843 --> 31:04.546
Do you feel your heart
starting to beat a little faster?

31:04.613 --> 31:07.315
It's not your mind
panicking.

31:07.383 --> 31:09.985
It's your body.
It's fighting to adapt.

31:10.052 --> 31:11.987
What, am I one of
your animals now?

31:12.055 --> 31:14.390
No.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.593
I didn't want them
to suffer.

31:18.396 --> 31:19.996
No--no, no!

31:25.337 --> 31:27.338
Greg's not at home, so he's
probably already at Kate's house.

31:27.406 --> 31:29.007
Kate's the object
of his hostility.

31:29.075 --> 31:30.408
He's gonna take his time.

31:30.476 --> 31:33.745
Let's light him up.
I'm sure he knows we're coming.

31:41.152 --> 31:42.886
They're coming for you.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.061
They're gonna be too late.

32:01.706 --> 32:04.542
Dave, take some uniforms
and find the back door.

32:04.610 --> 32:06.811
I'm gonna try to get
inside and talk to him.

32:06.879 --> 32:08.380
You think that's gonna work?

32:08.447 --> 32:11.349
I don't think Kate gets out
of this any other way.

32:11.417 --> 32:14.486
Your father,
he wouldn't want this.

32:15.955 --> 32:18.724
You have no right
to talk about him.

32:18.792 --> 32:19.758
He was my husband, Greg.

32:19.826 --> 32:21.926
He was my dad.

32:23.295 --> 32:25.397
You told him
to lock me up.

32:25.464 --> 32:27.065
You made me do it.
No.

32:27.132 --> 32:29.167
No, I didn't.
You did.

32:29.235 --> 32:31.569
You--you--what
you did to our puppy.

32:31.637 --> 32:33.538
What you did
to the neighbor's cat.

32:33.606 --> 32:34.939
I mean, he knew
what you were.

32:35.007 --> 32:37.742
Shut up!

32:37.810 --> 32:39.678
You ruined everything.

32:39.746 --> 32:41.880
No. I took care of you.

32:42.949 --> 32:44.517
We wanted the best
for you.

32:45.986 --> 32:47.353
Sending me away?

32:47.421 --> 32:49.523
What, so I wasn't
your problem anymore?

32:49.591 --> 32:50.590
What?!

32:50.658 --> 32:51.892
Greg Phinney, this is
Agent Aaron Hotchner.

32:51.959 --> 32:53.727
I need to talk to you
about your demands

32:53.795 --> 32:54.861
so you can let Kate go.

32:54.929 --> 32:57.264
I don't have any demands.

32:59.233 --> 33:02.435
I ju--I want--
I want her to pay for what she's done.

33:02.502 --> 33:05.070
What has she done?

33:05.138 --> 33:07.706
She took my dad.

33:07.773 --> 33:11.342
She's a whore,
and she ruined us.

33:11.410 --> 33:14.011
Greg, I think this is more
about your dad than it is about Kate.

33:15.781 --> 33:19.683
No. No, no. She--
she got me locked up.

33:19.751 --> 33:21.451
Your dad put you away.

33:23.521 --> 33:25.588
Don't turn this on him.

33:25.656 --> 33:27.957
Greg, I need to ask you
a very important question.

33:28.025 --> 33:29.525
Do you want to live?

33:30.694 --> 33:32.394
What do you mean?

33:32.462 --> 33:34.897
I think you do. And if so,
you need to let me in the house.

33:34.964 --> 33:37.766
Otherwise I can't guarantee
that you're gonna walk out of there.

33:42.471 --> 33:45.139
Uh, you can
come to the door.

33:49.010 --> 33:53.314
Seaver, I want you to come in with me.
Leave your firearm here.

33:54.516 --> 33:57.117
Be compassionate
and sympathetic to him.

33:57.185 --> 33:59.320
Let him tell you
how Kate betrayed him

33:59.388 --> 34:01.723
and how much you understand
his devastation.

34:19.708 --> 34:23.311
I never said that you could
bring in anyone else.

34:23.379 --> 34:24.978
I know, but I thought
if we talked inside

34:25.047 --> 34:26.981
we could work this out
ourselves.

34:27.049 --> 34:29.717
Are you some kind
of a negotiator?

34:34.255 --> 34:36.524
No guns.

34:36.592 --> 34:38.393
No guns.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.732
Ok.

34:56.514 --> 34:58.047
Close the door.

35:01.918 --> 35:03.385
All right.

35:03.453 --> 35:04.586
Stand over there.

35:06.422 --> 35:08.156
You need to put
the gun down.

35:08.224 --> 35:11.058
We need to get out of here.

35:11.126 --> 35:12.192
Is that gonna happen?

35:12.260 --> 35:13.360
As long as
you've got a gun,

35:13.428 --> 35:15.463
if one of the agents outside
has a clear shot,

35:15.530 --> 35:16.931
he'll take it.

35:27.976 --> 35:30.110
I don't have line of sight.

35:32.013 --> 35:34.181
We're ready to move
when you do.

35:35.818 --> 35:38.052
Tell me what you want,
Greg.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.290
You know, I don't want
to get locked up again.

35:41.357 --> 35:43.125
Don't you really want
Kate to apologize

35:43.193 --> 35:46.195
for making your dad
forget your mom?

35:46.263 --> 35:47.731
No, I didn't
do that, though.

35:47.798 --> 35:49.766
Unless the next words
out of your mouth are "I'm sorry,"

35:49.834 --> 35:52.002
I don't want to hear
anything else from you.

35:53.638 --> 35:56.240
I understand, Greg.

35:56.307 --> 35:57.407
I do.

35:57.475 --> 35:59.142
She took care of you.

35:59.210 --> 36:00.945
You trusted her.

36:01.012 --> 36:04.081
And then she betrayed you
as soon as your mother was gone.

36:04.149 --> 36:08.319
It must have crushed you
when Kate married your dad.

36:08.386 --> 36:10.387
How did it
make you feel, Greg?

36:10.455 --> 36:12.956
I'm sorry.

36:28.305 --> 36:30.739
You felt betrayed,
didn't you, Greg?

36:30.807 --> 36:33.109
Ask her the question, Greg.

36:34.478 --> 36:36.012
Go ahead.

36:41.819 --> 36:43.820
Ask her.

36:43.888 --> 36:47.324
Why not me?

36:47.391 --> 36:49.993
Why not me?

36:50.061 --> 36:51.161
Answer him, Kate.

36:51.229 --> 36:53.997
B-b-because

36:54.065 --> 36:55.565
you were just a...

36:55.633 --> 36:56.800
A boy.

37:00.238 --> 37:01.539
But I loved you.

37:03.575 --> 37:04.609
I loved you.

37:04.676 --> 37:05.610
I'm sorry.

37:05.678 --> 37:06.711
I'm sorry.

37:06.779 --> 37:07.846
But I loved you, Kate!

37:07.913 --> 37:11.082
Don't kill me, Greg, please!

37:17.589 --> 37:18.856
Bring in backup.

37:18.924 --> 37:20.624
Come on, let's go!

37:47.621 --> 37:49.589
Agent Seaver.

37:49.656 --> 37:51.190
Uh...

37:51.258 --> 37:53.226
What you said in there,

37:53.294 --> 37:54.961
is it true?

37:55.029 --> 37:58.231
Did he really do all this
because of me?

37:58.299 --> 37:59.566
No.

37:59.634 --> 38:00.833
I had to be aggressive
towards you

38:00.901 --> 38:02.969
in order to gain
Greg's trust.

38:03.037 --> 38:05.404
None of this
is your fault.

38:06.573 --> 38:08.507
Then why?

38:08.575 --> 38:11.010
Greg was always
a troubled child.

38:11.077 --> 38:13.679
Losing his mother
and then his father

38:13.747 --> 38:16.182
made him even
more unstable.

38:16.249 --> 38:19.151
Sometimes we do
everything right and we still lose.

38:19.219 --> 38:21.921
Greg was a sociopath and there's
nothing you could have done

38:21.989 --> 38:23.222
to change that.

38:26.493 --> 38:27.860
Thank you.

38:37.638 --> 38:39.205
Good work, agent.

38:41.475 --> 38:43.243
Thanks.

38:43.310 --> 38:44.977
Hey.

38:45.979 --> 38:48.814
Nice job, kid.

38:48.882 --> 38:50.849
Thank you.

38:59.827 --> 39:01.861
"Every journey
into the past

39:01.929 --> 39:04.364
"is complicated
by delusions,

39:04.432 --> 39:07.334
false memories,
false namings of real events."

39:07.402 --> 39:09.036
Adrienne Rich.

39:11.674 --> 39:13.575
You wanted to see me?

39:14.577 --> 39:16.611
Good job in San Diego.

39:16.678 --> 39:18.946
Thank you.

39:19.014 --> 39:20.281
Despite a challenging year,

39:20.349 --> 39:23.952
your team seems to be functioning
surprisingly well.

39:24.019 --> 39:25.354
But?

39:25.421 --> 39:26.355
No.

39:26.423 --> 39:28.457
I agree
with your assessment

39:28.525 --> 39:30.592
and so does the Director.

39:30.660 --> 39:33.995
Why, uh, why the interest
in the well-being of my team?

39:34.063 --> 39:36.998
The Director
has some concerns.

39:37.066 --> 39:39.333
What kind of concerns?

39:39.401 --> 39:41.502
There's a chance that
I might need your help,

39:41.570 --> 39:44.905
and I want you to be
in a position to assist.

39:46.574 --> 39:48.775
What's going on?

39:48.843 --> 39:52.011
I'm just dealing with
a few things right now.

39:52.079 --> 39:54.514
What is it?

39:56.283 --> 40:00.220
I might have to be away
for a few months.

40:00.287 --> 40:02.956
I'm not asking you
to step away from your duties,

40:03.023 --> 40:06.693
but I might need you
to supervise some departments.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.530
Whatever you need.
Of course.

40:10.798 --> 40:13.701
I'll be available
by phone.

40:15.938 --> 40:18.273
Would you...

40:18.340 --> 40:20.975
Do you want
to talk about it?

40:21.043 --> 40:23.445
So you can assess me?

40:28.652 --> 40:30.853
I don't do that either.
