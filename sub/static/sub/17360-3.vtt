WEBVTT

00:28.029 --> 00:30.530
Ah, hello, brothers.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.033
I like the new jumpsuits.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.701
Very fascist.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.162
I dig that.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.042
What happened here, Rainey?

00:42.043 --> 00:44.002
<i>Looks like a homicide.</i>

00:44.003 --> 00:46.338
You call me by the name
of my first shell, Pollux.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.717
Is that meant
to give you power over me?

00:50.718 --> 00:54.846
I was given an order
to come down to this shit hole at 2:00 A.M.

00:54.847 --> 00:57.140
I'm one of the original souls,

00:57.141 --> 00:58.933
and you do not tell me what to do

00:58.934 --> 01:02.228
like I'm some kind of drone
we found on the street.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.231
Are we not all equals?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.483
- Simply energy--
- That's big words

01:06.484 --> 01:10.987
from a guy who calls himself
"The Supreme Soul," hmm?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.323
At least as Lux DuJour,

01:13.324 --> 01:15.784
I try to do something.

01:15.785 --> 01:17.827
I try to create something.

01:17.828 --> 01:18.912
How many bodies have you been in

01:18.913 --> 01:21.081
in the last 10 years,
huh, Rainey,

01:21.082 --> 01:23.583
50? Hmm?

01:23.584 --> 01:25.919
What am I doing here?

01:25.920 --> 01:27.003
What's this all about?

01:27.004 --> 01:30.757
- Who are these people?
- Your energy is being redesignated.

01:30.758 --> 01:34.135
We found a new location for our temple.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.472
This body is the key.

01:37.473 --> 01:41.434
Say hello to your new vessel,
Gordon Rimmer.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.688
Redesignated?

01:45.689 --> 01:47.148
You can't do that.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.316
It's what's best for our cause.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.859
"Cause..."

01:49.860 --> 01:51.362
Right.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.238
You know, it's been decades,

01:53.239 --> 01:55.365
and if you really cared
about our great cause,

01:55.366 --> 01:58.952
you would have found Edgar Spring's
other machine years ago.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.288
You've become addicted
to this body, to this life.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.541
You can't do this to me.

02:04.542 --> 02:09.129
You can't swap me out against my will
into some fat piece of shit!

02:09.130 --> 02:10.381
I'm a rock star!

02:15.511 --> 02:18.138
Supreme Soul, please,
I'm making a new album.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.681
<i>You can't do this to me!</i>

02:19.682 --> 02:21.142
I'm a rock star!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.351
I'm a rock star!

02:23.352 --> 02:25.562
I'm a rock star...

02:25.563 --> 02:27.231
<i>I'm a rock star...</i>

02:31.902 --> 02:33.862
I have mace.

02:33.863 --> 02:37.657
Holy shit.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.075
You're Lydia Spring.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.661
Are you the one
that wrote this letter?

02:42.037 --> 02:43.496
I am.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.915
Do you really have answers?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.459
I do.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.044
Who is Zackariah Webb,

02:50.045 --> 02:53.173
and what was
his connection to my family?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.633
What happened to my grandfather?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.844
Who killed my mother?

02:59.263 --> 03:00.763
Zackariah Webb, I don't know,

03:00.764 --> 03:04.559
but I do know
what happened to your mother,

03:04.560 --> 03:07.605
and I know why your father is so afraid.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.484
Unbelievable.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.445
Why don't you... come inside?

03:15.446 --> 03:16.655
It's cold.

03:24.455 --> 03:26.498
Do you like Lux DuJour?

03:27.791 --> 03:29.627
Who the hell is Lux DuJour?

03:32.922 --> 03:34.089
Ouch.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.333
Take me to the house.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.523
Why are you hiding behind that bush?

04:33.524 --> 04:36.401
Because we're the ones
who burned the house down.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.612
Yeah, but they don't know that.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.203
My clothes look good on you.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.206
Okay.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.835
Thanks.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.088
Listen, um...

04:57.089 --> 04:58.965
I haven't had the chance to...

04:58.966 --> 05:00.049
You know...

05:00.050 --> 05:01.050
at the bridge?

05:01.051 --> 05:03.011
<i>With the dog?</i>

05:03.012 --> 05:04.971
You...

05:04.972 --> 05:06.932
That was brave of you.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.142
I guess you...

05:09.143 --> 05:11.311
saved me.

05:11.312 --> 05:12.771
So...

05:13.188 --> 05:14.315
Cool.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.359
So why did you burn down
this house again?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.486
Well, um...

05:20.487 --> 05:23.823
You said the guys who kidnapped me
thought you killed Patrick Spring?

05:23.824 --> 05:26.868
Correct. Absolutely no one
has any idea what's going on.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.911
I spoke to the police at the scene.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.121
What did they say?

05:30.122 --> 05:31.332
"Go away."

05:32.958 --> 05:34.208
Well, you're a detective.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.668
You've been gathering information.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.128
What have you found so far?

05:37.129 --> 05:38.379
Well...

05:38.380 --> 05:40.506
I gave the bad guys my phone number.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.925
You... gave them your phone number?

05:42.926 --> 05:43.843
In self-defense--

05:43.844 --> 05:46.929
- Give me your phone now.
- Wait, what are you doing?

05:46.930 --> 05:49.098
No, no, no, that's a bad idea.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.269
Oh.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.192
Oh... Okay.

06:00.778 --> 06:01.736
Hello.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.072
Where is Lydia Spring?

06:05.115 --> 06:06.866
Do you have the other machine?

06:06.867 --> 06:09.577
- What other machine?
<i>- That's the wrong answer.</i>

06:09.578 --> 06:10.953
<i>Where is Lydia!</i>

06:10.954 --> 06:12.205
Lydia's gone.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.499
What do we need to do to get her back?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.167
We're gonna find you, Miss Black.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.086
You do not want to find me.

06:18.087 --> 06:20.463
Your boss had something
that we need,

06:20.464 --> 06:21.381
<i>and before he died,</i>

06:21.382 --> 06:24.008
he was gonna hand it over
like a good little idiot,

06:24.009 --> 06:25.301
but now it's on you!

06:25.302 --> 06:29.055
This is your last chance.
Surrender Lydia Spring.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.310
I'll see you real soon.

06:43.112 --> 06:45.446
Uh, yes,
what did they say, exactly?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.866
That Lydia's... gone.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.493
I need to go back to the Spring Estate.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.619
Are you sure that's--

06:51.620 --> 06:53.287
All my things are there.
My clothes. My guns--

06:53.288 --> 06:54.831
- You look good.
- No more guns!

06:54.832 --> 06:57.458
- We'll go with you.
- Okay, enough. Enough! I'm done.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.793
I check out. I check out of this!

06:58.794 --> 07:01.629
Hey, listen, wait,
hold on a moment.

07:01.630 --> 07:04.757
- What?
- Are you...

07:04.758 --> 07:06.217
mad at me?

07:06.218 --> 07:07.803
Am I "mad at you"?

07:08.554 --> 07:10.388
Y-- N--

07:10.389 --> 07:13.349
I don't know.
I-I don't know what I am, "at you."

07:13.350 --> 07:14.726
Good.

07:15.978 --> 07:16.853
See you soon, Todd.

07:16.854 --> 07:18.147
But...

07:23.235 --> 07:24.235
So...

07:24.236 --> 07:25.570
Farah--

07:25.571 --> 07:27.947
The bullet.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.241
That hit the man
keeping me prisoner,

07:30.242 --> 07:32.076
it was military.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.369
Punched clean through the floor,

07:33.370 --> 07:36.831
high terminal velocity, 7.62.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.791
I thought you said

07:38.792 --> 07:40.877
the landlord shot at you with a pistol?

07:40.878 --> 07:41.961
He did.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.548
So then how's the military involved?

07:54.141 --> 07:56.726
- Colonel Riggins, sir.
<i>- Good day, Corporal Friedkin.</i>

07:56.727 --> 08:00.354
We're prepping for direct contact
with a former Black Wing subject.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.440
Sir, yes, sir.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.902
What is Black Wing, sir?

08:06.028 --> 08:08.113
It's what we are.
It's who I am.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.281
Did you...

08:10.282 --> 08:11.908
not read the file?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.701
File, sir?

08:13.702 --> 08:15.537
- Yes.
- Yes?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.835
In 1988,

08:22.836 --> 08:26.088
the Central Intelligence Agency
assigned me as Operations Chief

08:26.089 --> 08:27.632
<i>of a division of my own creation.</i>

08:27.633 --> 08:32.428
This division was given
the code name "Black Wing."

08:32.429 --> 08:33.846
Black Wing had one mission,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.641
to seek out, codify,
and collect individuals

08:36.642 --> 08:40.645
with sensory-perceptive abilities
beyond the normal human scale.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.188
So, like, fat people?

08:42.189 --> 08:43.189
What?

08:43.190 --> 08:46.609
Fat people who were big
on the scale, sir?

08:46.610 --> 08:49.445
N-no. Not...

08:49.446 --> 08:51.155
Fat people?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.949
What--

08:52.950 --> 08:55.702
Files. Yes.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.373
- Seatbelt.
- Yes.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.314
Cheer up.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.942
Jesus... Why?

09:27.943 --> 09:29.569
Because.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.363
You know, we were having fun.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.532
You were talking to me about stuff.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.325
You know, you were asking
me questions and stuff?

09:36.326 --> 09:37.743
You know, it was good.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.828
Yeah,

09:38.829 --> 09:40.706
and then you killed that guy.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.292
Potato potato.

09:44.334 --> 09:49.088
You're supposed to say
it like "potato po-tah-to."

09:49.089 --> 09:50.591
What the hell is a "po-tah-to"?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.932
Oh, man... really?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.267
Do you know this song?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.352
Yes, of course.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.313
How? Like... like
you've heard it before?

10:05.314 --> 10:06.230
Yes.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.692
Do you know the words
of the song he's gonna sing?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.280
How?

10:14.281 --> 10:17.366
Do they play the same song on the radio
more than once?

10:17.367 --> 10:18.619
Yes.

10:19.369 --> 10:22.622
How could you possibly not know that?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.831
I don't...

10:23.832 --> 10:25.708
I don't know who the people
on the radio are.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.209
I never met them.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.794
I don't know where
they're singing from.

10:28.795 --> 10:32.382
They're not singing anywhere.
It's a recording.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.843
Oh...

10:37.054 --> 10:40.097
- Oh, now you're laughing.
- No, I'm not laughing.

10:42.059 --> 10:44.769
Sing one of the--
Sing it.

10:44.770 --> 10:45.645
Why?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.104
To prove you know it.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.148
I mean, I don't know
the words of songs and stuff,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.399
but then I turn on the radio,

10:50.400 --> 10:54.278
and you know the words of the songs
he's going to sing... you know?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.906
It's kind of unbelievable.

10:56.907 --> 10:57.907
<i>...It was meant to be</i>

10:57.908 --> 10:58.741
<i>I don't care--</i>

10:58.742 --> 11:01.452
<i>Who you are</i>

11:01.453 --> 11:03.245
<i>Where you're from</i>

11:03.246 --> 11:06.874
<i>Don't care what you did--</i>

11:06.875 --> 11:08.918
<i>As long as you love me</i>

11:08.919 --> 11:11.128
How do you remember that stuff?

11:11.129 --> 11:13.255
<i>Where you're from</i>

11:13.256 --> 11:15.299
<i>Don't care what you did</i>

11:32.192 --> 11:34.276
<i>Hey, it's Todd. Leave a message.</i>

11:34.277 --> 11:39.949
Hey, Todd, I'm outside,
so there's that.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.283
I've been thinking
about what Dirk said

11:41.284 --> 11:42.952
about me being
in the house all the time,

11:42.953 --> 11:44.662
and he's right.

11:44.663 --> 11:48.582
Maybe if I'm, like, out of food,
I can go get my own.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.752
It's gonna suck either way,
so what am I afraid of?

11:52.921 --> 11:56.132
I'm going to the grocery store,
so you know.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.633
What an adventure.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.535
<i>You are not gonna believe this.</i>

12:24.536 --> 12:25.579
Hey.

12:28.874 --> 12:30.791
- Is that the dog?
- It's the dog from the tape.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.042
The dog from the tape.

12:32.043 --> 12:35.045
The dog from the tape
from the hotel.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.006
Dog from the tape
from the hotel...

12:37.007 --> 12:38.090
Where was it?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.008
Literally outside,

12:39.009 --> 12:41.218
barking at uniforms
on their way in--

12:41.219 --> 12:44.597
The dog from the tape from the hotel
walked into this police station?

12:44.598 --> 12:47.933
This appears to be the situation.
It gets weirder.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.643
I checked the address on the tag.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.228
The place burned down yesterday.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.273
Burned down...
Like, got burnt down?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.525
That's what they're saying.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.237
Missing.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.572
<i>- Uh...</i>
- Persons.

13:01.573 --> 13:05.451
<i>Visitor for Missing Persons,
says his name is Todd Brotzman?</i>

13:05.452 --> 13:07.828
Our friend, Todd.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.121
From the hotel.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.623
And the dog from the tape,

13:10.624 --> 13:11.707
from the hotel,

13:11.708 --> 13:14.460
arriving simultaneously.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.378
- That's not a coincidence.
- Not a coincidence.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.840
- Too many coincidences.
- Too many coincidences.

13:21.218 --> 13:22.302
Hide the dog.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.306
Fantastic!
It's bloody huge.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.349
Is that a horse barn?

13:28.350 --> 13:30.601
Rhino barn, actually.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.394
Patrick loved animals.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.855
In the '90s, he had a pet rhino named "Pepe."

13:34.856 --> 13:36.732
Did you know Pepe?

13:36.733 --> 13:37.943
I did.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.070
My father was Patrick's
old chief of security.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.989
<i>I spent a lot of time here.
It's actually a historic landmark,</i>

13:43.990 --> 13:47.785
built in the 1880s for an inventor
named Zackariah Webb.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.495
But he disappeared,

13:49.496 --> 13:51.413
so the place fell into disrepair.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.666
By the '70s,
squatters were living here.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.210
But Patrick bought it back
from the government in the mid-'90s,

13:56.211 --> 13:57.753
just before what
happened to his wife.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.964
What happened to his wife?

13:59.965 --> 14:01.216
She died.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.260
Miss Black!

14:03.969 --> 14:05.678
Good to see you, John.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.763
I thought I heard someone drive in.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.889
Who's this again?

14:08.890 --> 14:10.975
John Dollow. He's--

14:10.976 --> 14:13.727
was Patrick's Lawyer.
You've never met him.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.689
Yes, he seems like
someone I've never met.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.109
John Dollow, this is Dirk Gently.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.404
Ooh, isn't that, um...

14:23.405 --> 14:24.697
interesting.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.574
I get that a lot.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.741
Well, uh,

14:27.742 --> 14:29.827
take a moment,
then come and find me.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.288
I'll be in Mr. Spring's office.

14:32.289 --> 14:34.165
I have something for you.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.005
<i>You said you saw Lydia.</i>

14:41.006 --> 14:42.882
Yes. Yes, I saw her.

14:42.883 --> 14:45.801
She was acting... odd,
but I saw her,

14:45.802 --> 14:48.804
and I-I don't know
if they killed Patrick Spring,

14:48.805 --> 14:50.848
but those weird guys are dangerous.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.392
These are the men who you
traded the dog with for Farah Black?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.518
Yes, yes, the same guys.

14:54.519 --> 14:55.811
They were involved,

14:55.812 --> 14:58.397
and I'm not...

14:58.398 --> 15:01.984
I-I'm realizing
I don't actually the details, but...

15:01.985 --> 15:03.445
it's all connected, right?

15:06.781 --> 15:10.242
Do you know of a band
called <i>The Mexican Funeral</i>?

15:10.243 --> 15:12.328
Yeah, that was my band.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.121
Four years ago,
they filed a police report,

15:14.122 --> 15:16.749
saying that their
equipment had been stolen.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.210
Your name is on the report.
$4,000 worth of gear.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.212
Stolen.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.757
<i>But it wasn't stolen, was it, Todd?</i>

15:24.758 --> 15:25.925
Okay, look, I-I didn't--

15:25.926 --> 15:27.551
You sold your band's gear
without telling them,

15:27.552 --> 15:28.886
and then reported it stolen.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.804
Kind of a rotten thing to do, huh?

15:30.805 --> 15:32.473
I was going through a rough time.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.807
We know that, too.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.559
Something to do with a medical condition.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.519
- You know about that?
- We know about a lot of things.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.855
- We called your parents.
- Wait, you called my parents?

15:39.856 --> 15:41.690
- We're the police, Todd.
- We investigate shit--

15:41.691 --> 15:43.442
That's what we do.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.443
You're investigating me?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.486
We told you before, Todd,

15:45.487 --> 15:47.071
you're what we like to call
"a person of interest."

15:47.072 --> 15:49.990
Who's getting more and more
interesting all the time.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.368
Your parents told us
you have this medical condition,

15:52.369 --> 15:54.453
<i>runs in the family,
your sister now has it, too.</i>

15:54.454 --> 15:56.872
"Pararibulitus." Very rare.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.958
- We're looking into it.
- A lot of real interesting stuff.

15:58.959 --> 16:00.709
Okay, okay, what does
this have to do with

16:00.710 --> 16:02.795
what's happening right now?

16:02.796 --> 16:04.797
I-I came here to try to help.

16:04.798 --> 16:07.383
Are you accusing me of something?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.343
Is there something
we should be accusing you of?

16:09.344 --> 16:10.177
Well, let's see.

16:10.178 --> 16:12.763
Well, there's the house,
the address you gave us...

16:12.764 --> 16:14.431
It burned down yesterday.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.433
- And they're not ruling out arson.
- You said you were there.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.852
That puts you at-- no, no,
let me see, what is it--

16:18.853 --> 16:20.229
- Three?
- Three.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.647
<i>Three, total, crime scenes.</i>

16:21.648 --> 16:22.481
And don't think we don't know

16:22.482 --> 16:24.316
about you taking the money
back from your landlord, bud.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.859
The one who is now dead.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.069
We know about that...

16:27.070 --> 16:28.822
Oh, we know about that.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.519
I made it.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.771
What?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.232
I made it.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.401
Good.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.533
No, no, no, no...

17:15.702 --> 17:17.453
Miss?
Are you okay?

17:21.458 --> 17:23.792
<i>Mr. Brotzman?</i>

17:23.793 --> 17:27.963
You are becoming
a very compelling figure,

17:27.964 --> 17:30.841
almost as interesting
as your detective buddy.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.510
The one with the friends
in all the high places.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.861
Amanda?

17:50.862 --> 17:52.029
Todd! I messed up.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.281
Will you please help me?
I messed up!

17:54.282 --> 17:55.407
- Where are you?
<i>- Help!</i>

17:55.408 --> 17:56.867
Amanda, what are you--

17:56.868 --> 17:57.869
Amanda!

17:59.871 --> 18:02.623
Can I... go?

18:02.624 --> 18:04.626
That was my sister.
She needs me to pick her up.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.712
Sure.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.048
You're here voluntarily. Right?

18:11.049 --> 18:12.175
Right.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.305
Ooh, that kid's guilty.

18:18.306 --> 18:19.891
Yeah, but of what?

18:27.232 --> 18:28.733
Check out the whack-job.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.112
This shit is hilarious.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.331
No! No! No! Now!

18:44.541 --> 18:46.084
- What the hell--
- What the hell?

18:47.127 --> 18:48.377
To the bleachers!

18:48.378 --> 18:49.671
I don't like him.

18:49.921 --> 18:52.257
I got a bone to pick!

18:52.757 --> 18:55.260
Boys.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.899
<i>You're not supposed to be here.</i>

19:10.900 --> 19:13.152
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Lux DuJour!</i>

19:14.237 --> 19:16.029
I'm just doing my job.

19:17.198 --> 19:18.741
Whoa.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.150
Help me!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.488
Help me!

20:04.412 --> 20:05.871
Bart!

20:05.872 --> 20:07.789
<i>- Is that you?</i>
- Yeah, probably.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.417
Hey, can't you
get us down from here?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.002
You know, with your thing?

20:12.003 --> 20:13.295
What thing?

20:13.296 --> 20:14.963
You know, your...

20:14.964 --> 20:18.050
flow of the universe thing.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.469
I thought you didn't believe in that.

20:23.014 --> 20:29.144
You know, it's funny, I knew.
I knew I'd die in some...

20:29.145 --> 20:31.605
oh, some weird way, eventually.

20:31.606 --> 20:33.649
You know, for a pretty scared guy,

20:33.650 --> 20:35.651
you sure do hang around
with some dangerous types.

20:35.652 --> 20:36.652
You kidnapped me!

20:36.653 --> 20:37.903
I meant before that.

20:39.113 --> 20:41.990
Yeah, well...

20:43.868 --> 20:46.870
Eventually, I thought,
I'd get a real job, but...

20:46.871 --> 20:48.372
you get a payday
from one bad guy,

20:48.373 --> 20:50.249
you get a payday
from another bad guy.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.042
- Hey, Ken...
- Yeah?

20:52.043 --> 20:54.795
You should know,
when they come back,

20:54.796 --> 20:58.423
either you're gonna die,
or I'm gonna kill all them.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.510
Or you're gonna die,
and then I'm gonna kill all them.

21:01.511 --> 21:04.763
Or I'm gonna kill some of them,
and then you get killed,

21:04.764 --> 21:06.390
and then I kill the rest.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.933
No matter what happens,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.559
I want you to know that

21:09.560 --> 21:11.354
that's the way it's meant to be.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.107
W-what about you, Bart,

21:15.108 --> 21:18.151
- you'll be fine no matter what?
- Yeah.

21:18.152 --> 21:19.404
I don't get hurt.

21:24.409 --> 21:26.661
I do think
I'm gonna miss you, though.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.624
<i>Help me!</i>

21:32.625 --> 21:34.251
I've been going through
Mr. Spring's effects,

21:34.252 --> 21:38.964
and executing his final wishes
according to his last will and testament.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.634
He left this for you.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.679
What's interesting is that
his instructions were

21:45.680 --> 21:50.434
not to give it to you unless you were
in the presence of someone named...

21:50.435 --> 21:52.769
Dirk Gently.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.187
Well, it's lucky I'm here then.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.398
Oh, I doubt very much
it's got to do with luck.

21:56.399 --> 22:00.194
Patrick Spring rarely left
anything of importance to chance.

22:10.788 --> 22:15.000
When Patrick had me track you down,

22:15.001 --> 22:16.044
he knew.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.422
He knew he was going to die.

22:20.965 --> 22:22.466
Do you know,
I'm beginning to think

22:22.467 --> 22:27.220
he didn't hire me
to prevent his murder at all.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.349
I think he hired me to solve it.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.601
Hmm...

22:32.602 --> 22:35.729
"Three questions, one answer."

22:35.730 --> 22:36.898
What does that mean?

22:39.233 --> 22:42.362
Perhaps we should give
the young lady a moment.

22:52.914 --> 22:54.414
Get it together.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.792
Get. It. Together--

22:56.793 --> 22:57.834
What are you looking at?

22:57.835 --> 22:59.921
What? I thought...

23:01.214 --> 23:02.714
...you were outside.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.967
Why would I leave the room?
All the good stuff is happening in here.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.434
Were you and Patrick...

23:15.978 --> 23:16.979
close?

23:19.982 --> 23:23.527
I've known him my entire life.

23:23.528 --> 23:28.156
When Catherine was killed,
my dad never recovered,

23:28.157 --> 23:31.451
and Patrick gave my life
a lot of purpose,

23:31.452 --> 23:34.288
if that makes any sense,
and I don't...

23:37.166 --> 23:39.626
In three days, everything
just suddenly went crazy,

23:39.627 --> 23:42.212
and I screwed it all up again!

23:42.213 --> 23:46.174
Patrick's dead, Lydia's gone.
I feel like a...

23:46.175 --> 23:48.009
...crazy confused failure

23:48.010 --> 23:50.971
talking to a Brit who keeps asking
me questions that don't make sense!

23:50.972 --> 23:52.222
I am...

23:52.223 --> 23:54.558
I am ineffectual,
and a generalized scramble

23:54.559 --> 23:56.268
of disappointment
and incompetence, I--

23:56.269 --> 23:57.727
No, no, listen...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.774
You're only some of those things.

24:21.878 --> 24:24.087
Okay... I need to go find Lydia--

24:24.088 --> 24:27.090
No, we can't leave, not yet.

24:27.091 --> 24:28.468
Why?

24:29.760 --> 24:31.052
Do you know something?

24:31.053 --> 24:32.929
I don't know anything.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.182
Ever.
It's really quite relaxing.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.185
But this is what I do,
this is how I work.

24:38.186 --> 24:40.395
I follow fate around.

24:40.396 --> 24:42.022
It's how we found you.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.399
I can't promise anything, but just...

24:44.400 --> 24:45.568
give it a chance?

24:47.028 --> 24:48.695
Well, what do you want to do?

24:48.696 --> 24:51.157
I would start by
opening that envelope.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.206
"You."

24:59.207 --> 25:01.459
This doesn't look anything like you.
He's got the hair all wrong--

25:11.552 --> 25:13.095
Um...

25:14.096 --> 25:15.639
Farah?

25:15.640 --> 25:17.557
What are you...

25:17.558 --> 25:18.767
No, where are you--

25:18.768 --> 25:20.435
Oh, it's a map...

25:20.436 --> 25:21.812
It's a map! I get it!

25:36.536 --> 25:37.744
God!

25:37.745 --> 25:39.037
Jesus Christ...

25:39.038 --> 25:40.372
Oh, thank God, you're okay.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.958
I just went shopping, it's okay, it's okay.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.335
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

25:45.336 --> 25:46.836
Everything's okay,

25:46.837 --> 25:50.215
I just-- I had a little flare-up, but...

25:50.216 --> 25:53.927
- I made it home in one piece.
- Okay.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.262
Why are you so out of breath?

25:55.263 --> 25:58.098
How did you get here?
I thought that your car was all beat up.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.891
I ran,
and then I took the bus,

25:59.892 --> 26:02.102
and then I ran some more.

26:02.103 --> 26:04.187
God, I was so worried.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.149
Phew!

26:09.068 --> 26:10.653
Where's Dirk?

26:12.822 --> 26:14.030
"Where's Dirk?"

26:14.031 --> 26:17.784
Yeah, I just, I have
to ask him about some stuff,

26:17.785 --> 26:19.786
'cause some stuff happened.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.205
You want to ask Dirk Gently
about some stuff?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.875
I mean, isn't he the reason
that all this weird stuff is happening?

26:28.629 --> 26:29.671
What weird stuff?

26:29.672 --> 26:31.131
Everything.

26:31.132 --> 26:33.675
Look, he doesn't know anything.

26:33.676 --> 26:36.386
The amount of stuff that
he doesn't know is stupefying.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.470
It would blow your mind.

26:37.471 --> 26:40.974
Okay, but...
isn't that how he works?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.434
Like, as a detective?

26:42.435 --> 26:46.187
- He is barely a detective.
- Okay...

26:46.188 --> 26:48.231
then why are you his assistant?

26:48.232 --> 26:49.107
I'm not--

26:49.108 --> 26:50.693
There's something
that you're not telling me.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.571
Is there, like,

26:54.572 --> 26:57.782
a lot of stuff
that you're not telling me?

26:57.783 --> 27:00.952
No. I... No, there's just--

27:00.953 --> 27:03.455
Look, I think maybe it's a good idea
if you came to stay with me.

27:03.456 --> 27:04.581
You want me to leave the house?

27:04.582 --> 27:07.584
You did already today,
and it was fine, right?

27:07.585 --> 27:09.544
No, it wasn't fine.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.296
Well... it was...

27:11.297 --> 27:14.049
almost...

27:14.050 --> 27:15.259
not fine.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.306
Don't you remember
what this was like?

27:22.099 --> 27:23.558
I-I'll call a cab.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.853
I used to take cabs all the time
when I still had attacks.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.521
You'll stay with me.

27:28.522 --> 27:30.358
It'll be great, I promise.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.653
Or here...

27:34.654 --> 27:35.863
Farah, I think if we--

27:42.828 --> 27:44.621
Farah?

27:44.622 --> 27:47.457
I-I've got it, I've got it,
I've got an idea, I've got an idea.

27:47.458 --> 27:48.917
Sorry, got it wrong.

27:48.918 --> 27:50.919
It's down here.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.296
It's definitely this way!

27:59.553 --> 28:01.263
That didn't work.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.654
This is it.

28:18.322 --> 28:19.989
Um...

28:19.990 --> 28:22.325
Okay, you're a bit
ahead of me now on this one.

28:22.326 --> 28:24.536
What, laundry?

28:24.537 --> 28:25.829
Maybe it's...

28:25.830 --> 28:27.163
Ah-hah.

28:27.164 --> 28:28.164
Nope, not in there.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.209
What are we looking for?
Do you know?

28:35.965 --> 28:36.966
It's a wall.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.594
Was there something about this wall
that was special to him?

28:41.595 --> 28:43.888
Did he enjoy walls?

28:43.889 --> 28:46.266
Did he ever mention a love for walls?

28:46.267 --> 28:47.559
<i>Because that could be a clue.</i>

28:47.560 --> 28:50.311
Perhaps the person or people
who killed Patrick Spring

28:50.312 --> 28:52.355
were rogue wall-enthusiasts.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.733
Ah!

28:55.484 --> 28:57.777
You hate these walls!

29:11.751 --> 29:13.043
Give me the map.

29:42.364 --> 29:46.242
Oh... what is this place?

29:46.243 --> 29:48.953
This room was built
into the foundation of the house.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.415
It's been here since day one.

29:53.501 --> 29:57.545
Patrick Spring didn't build this,
Zackariah Webb did.

29:57.546 --> 30:01.383
What's that big... electro... thingy?

30:10.184 --> 30:12.727
Some kind of generator.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.354
But this doesn't make any sense.

30:14.355 --> 30:17.233
Patrick didn't know anything
about technology.

30:19.652 --> 30:20.861
Oh.

30:25.157 --> 30:28.117
How... did you do that?

30:28.118 --> 30:29.703
With my hand.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.084
What's this?

30:40.422 --> 30:42.298
"Edgar Spring."
Who's that?

30:42.299 --> 30:46.719
Patrick's father.
But this is Patrick's handwriting.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.057
"It started here. It ends here.
Please save her."

30:54.395 --> 30:56.729
What is this thing?

30:56.730 --> 30:58.691
Very important.

31:03.696 --> 31:05.364
"Please save her."

31:06.365 --> 31:09.701
"Please save her."
"Save her..."

31:09.702 --> 31:12.078
Save her.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.956
He must be talking about Lydia.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.959
He planned this.

31:17.960 --> 31:20.712
All of it.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.338
But...

31:22.339 --> 31:24.508
if Patrick knew this
was going to happen, then...

31:25.634 --> 31:27.344
why didn't he save himself?

31:29.013 --> 31:30.347
Dirk?

31:32.224 --> 31:35.227
I'm starting to think you're actually
a pretty good detective.

31:52.119 --> 31:53.912
- Bart...
- Yeah?

31:53.913 --> 31:55.538
- Bart. Bart!
- Ken?

31:55.539 --> 31:58.249
Please do something!
Do anything!

31:58.250 --> 31:59.459
Something, please!

31:59.460 --> 32:01.461
It doesn't work like that.

32:01.462 --> 32:02.922
Why? What?

32:03.672 --> 32:04.798
Oh, my God.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.147
These are the ones that killed Jake?

32:21.148 --> 32:22.690
<i>They don't look like professional hires.</i>

32:22.691 --> 32:26.235
- Ken, is that a new guy?
- Who sent you?

32:26.236 --> 32:27.487
The Cavatos?

32:27.488 --> 32:29.364
I don't know who the Cavatos are.

32:29.365 --> 32:32.575
Okay, she's crazy, all right?
She killed him, not me.

32:32.576 --> 32:34.494
I mean, I'm just here.

32:34.495 --> 32:35.870
She killed him.
She's the one, man--

32:35.871 --> 32:37.205
This is just noise.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.123
I don't care.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.208
You're gonna burn.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.503
Ken!
That the new guy, who just arrived?

32:43.504 --> 32:45.088
That's who we're waiting for.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.425
Listen, please!
Just get me down.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.970
<i>I'm not the guy you want.</i>

32:51.512 --> 32:52.845
She is, okay?

32:52.846 --> 32:55.099
- This'll shut him up.
- Do something--

32:58.018 --> 32:59.435
No!

33:33.137 --> 33:34.430
Put some clothes on.

33:45.190 --> 33:47.735
You knew this was going to happen.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.655
Well, not this,
but something like this, sure.

33:53.157 --> 33:55.074
It's real, isn't it?

33:55.075 --> 33:56.951
It's all real.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.579
You really are
who you say you are.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.622
Some kind of...

34:01.623 --> 34:04.168
- killer angel.
- Angel?

34:09.798 --> 34:12.425
I really am what I say I am.

34:12.426 --> 34:15.053
I'm with you for a reason.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.804
My life is...

34:16.805 --> 34:19.682
is happening for a reason.

34:19.683 --> 34:21.768
Maybe, yeah.

34:21.769 --> 34:23.353
We have to find Dirk Gently.

34:24.813 --> 34:27.482
We need to kill Dirk Gently.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.400
You drive.

34:34.073 --> 34:35.574
This is fun!

34:38.202 --> 34:40.995
See? That wasn't so bad, right?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.830
What happened to your lock?

34:42.831 --> 34:45.625
Oh, my God--
What happened to your apartment?

34:45.626 --> 34:48.336
- Uh, well, it-

34:48.337 --> 34:50.171
- Some kind of semiconductor.
- Semiconductor?

34:50.172 --> 34:51.506
Oh, God.

34:51.507 --> 34:52.507
Hey, Dirk!

34:52.508 --> 34:55.176
Oh, hi, Amanda!
Look, it's Amanda.

34:55.177 --> 34:57.763
- Amanda's fantastic.
- You're fantastic.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.099
Is this part of the case?

35:01.100 --> 35:03.351
- Yes, but--
- Dirk, why are you here?

35:03.352 --> 35:05.394
- We were waiting for you.
- Hey, Todd.

35:05.395 --> 35:07.064
Oh, hi, Farah.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.191
What is this?

35:10.192 --> 35:12.902
We don't know. We think it's
some sort of schematic or something.

35:12.903 --> 35:15.154
Dirk, this is my apartment.

35:15.155 --> 35:16.614
Oh, is that why you're here?

35:16.615 --> 35:18.199
It's a map.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.576
It's another map.
A map lead us to a map!

35:20.577 --> 35:21.577
It's not a map.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.329
It's one of those layers on maps

35:23.330 --> 35:25.248
that you can see on
city government websites

35:25.249 --> 35:26.332
that show you utilities.

35:26.333 --> 35:27.542
City government?

35:27.543 --> 35:29.710
- I don't get out that much.
- Me neither.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.963
This is an electrical grid, see?

35:31.964 --> 35:34.090
And those are power lines.

35:34.091 --> 35:37.135
Oh, cool!
No, this is really crazy.

35:37.136 --> 35:39.220
Oh my God, she's right.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.013
Look, those are where
the roads would be,

35:41.014 --> 35:44.268
and that's the Ridgely.
That's this building.

35:46.186 --> 35:47.353
I'm Farah.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.021
I'm Amanda.

35:49.022 --> 35:50.273
Cool jacket.

35:50.274 --> 35:51.733
It's all happening.

35:52.359 --> 35:54.570
Oh, for godsakes...

36:03.495 --> 36:04.453
Oh!

36:04.454 --> 36:05.788
Will you stop following me?

36:05.789 --> 36:09.333
I was just going down to get
the magic lightbulb from my car.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.169
Magic lightbulb!

36:11.170 --> 36:12.336
Look, what did I tell you--

36:12.337 --> 36:14.088
Just, Dirk, will you just
get out of my apartment.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.591
I told you it would bend back
around to you, and now it has!

36:16.592 --> 36:17.466
Give me a second.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.093
We're meant to know each other.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.305
Now, I'm sick
of having this conversation!

36:22.306 --> 36:23.472
There's a map in there

36:23.473 --> 36:26.685
with your bloody building
right at the center of it.

36:30.772 --> 36:32.149
I want your help.

36:38.488 --> 36:39.531
This neighborhood...

36:41.241 --> 36:45.119
the one we're in right now,

36:45.120 --> 36:47.538
it's called Springsborough.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.248
Like...

36:49.249 --> 36:52.168
Like Edgar Spring.

36:52.169 --> 36:54.921
That was Patrick Spring's father, right?

36:54.922 --> 36:56.798
Springsborough.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.887
It's not a coincidence, is it?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.181
No.

37:05.682 --> 37:08.185
I'm certain we'll find that it's not.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.437
You knew this was going to happen.

37:11.438 --> 37:14.482
Not this, but...

37:14.483 --> 37:16.817
something like this, yes.

37:16.818 --> 37:19.362
It's real, isn't it?

37:19.363 --> 37:21.822
It's all real.

37:21.823 --> 37:23.616
You really are
what you say you are,

37:23.617 --> 37:26.661
some kind of... holistic detective.

37:26.662 --> 37:27.871
I'm trying.

37:29.665 --> 37:32.667
Is this enough proof?

37:32.668 --> 37:34.294
Will you help me?

37:48.558 --> 37:50.143
Hello, Project Icarus.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.564
No.

37:56.692 --> 38:00.361
<i>- Leave me alone.</i>
- Svlad, we need to talk.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.406
- That's not my name anymore.
- "Dirk," then.

38:03.407 --> 38:05.157
I said, leave me alone--

38:05.158 --> 38:06.492
Friedkin!

38:06.493 --> 38:08.160
<i>Friedkin, goddamn it, get off of him!</i>

38:08.161 --> 38:09.078
He was escaping.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.997
You release him now, soldier,
that's an order!

38:14.626 --> 38:17.211
Is this what you do now?
You just attack people?

38:17.212 --> 38:19.381
Sorry, sir, I got confused.

38:23.302 --> 38:24.969
He seems like a winner.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.221
- Dirk, listen to me.
- Why, do you have new lies to tell me?

38:27.222 --> 38:29.557
We need you to come back in,
for debriefing.

38:29.558 --> 38:32.393
Yes, why not, it's only been 16 years.

38:32.394 --> 38:34.895
Black Wing is under review.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.398
That's why we bailed you out
when the police brought you in.

38:37.399 --> 38:40.693
- It's the least you can do--
- The least I could do?

38:40.694 --> 38:42.278
This is in your best interest,

38:42.279 --> 38:44.573
You promised them something
and you couldn't deliver.

38:45.949 --> 38:49.201
You promised me something,
and you couldn't deliver.

38:49.202 --> 38:53.539
Dirk, I am not the enemy here.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.666
And you're not a detective.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.501
You're going to get
yourself hurt, or killed,

38:57.502 --> 39:00.212
- if you keep--
- I am on a case!

39:00.213 --> 39:02.423
I have friends!

39:02.424 --> 39:03.799
And-and we found clues.

39:03.800 --> 39:06.594
We're going to solve a mystery,
a real one!

39:06.595 --> 39:10.431
And some people think
I'm a pretty good detective!

39:10.432 --> 39:13.601
I'm trying to protect you.
I don't know what they'll do.

39:13.602 --> 39:14.685
I don't care.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.854
I don't need you.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.487
Go back to hiding in the shadows.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.616
It was the only thing
you were ever good at.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.629
- Do you want me to go get him?
- No.

39:41.630 --> 39:43.964
Not now.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.300
We'll try another angle.

39:46.301 --> 39:50.513
You'll get them, sir.
All of them.

39:50.514 --> 39:52.015
We have to.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.230
Just here right now.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.274
I'll get it going, and then I'll...

40:02.401 --> 40:04.945
Doesn't look like anyone else has
been here since we were here.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.243
There's a ton of bodies to clean up,
but everything still works.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.369
Bring him here.

40:13.370 --> 40:16.038
And bring a mouse.

40:20.377 --> 40:22.169
<i>...Cooler temperatures arrive after that,</i>

40:22.170 --> 40:24.171
<i>47 for a high on Tuesday.</i>

40:24.172 --> 40:26.549
<i>And now a surprising update</i>

40:26.550 --> 40:28.843
