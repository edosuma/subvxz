WEBVTT

00:13.213 --> 00:14.213
Terrific!

00:34.630 --> 00:37.338
So I put my finger here,
and check this...

00:37.713 --> 00:40.088
the watch tells me I have a heart problem.

00:40.171 --> 00:42.088
Wouldn't a mirror tell you the same thing?

00:42.171 --> 00:44.213
Yeah, but this has weather, too.

00:44.296 --> 00:45.130
Okay.

00:45.505 --> 00:47.838
We got an hour until
we're meeting the ladies for dinner.

00:47.921 --> 00:49.130
- Yeah.
- You wanna catch a beer?

00:49.213 --> 00:51.088
I can't. I gotta run a few errands.

00:51.171 --> 00:53.588
What? You don't want a beer? What's wrong?

00:53.671 --> 00:54.630
I...

00:54.963 --> 00:57.671
got the results back
from the detective exam.

00:57.755 --> 01:00.755
You failed again?
This is why I never took that test.

01:00.838 --> 01:02.963
All the anxiety and disappointment.

01:03.046 --> 01:05.755
At some point, you have to realize
you have hit your ceiling

01:05.838 --> 01:07.005
and just give up.

01:07.088 --> 01:09.088
You know, you should go around
and speak at schools.

01:09.171 --> 01:11.963
- That was very inspiring.
- I should. Kids need to hear this shit.

01:12.046 --> 01:13.046
I don't get it, man.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.963
I know all the answers,
I just freeze under pressure.

01:16.046 --> 01:18.505
You know, I can't take the exam
for, like, three more months,

01:18.588 --> 01:20.213
so I gotta continue lying to Audrey.

01:20.296 --> 01:22.005
So when we're at dinner tonight, please,

01:22.088 --> 01:23.463
- tell your wi--
- Ah! No.

01:23.546 --> 01:25.921
Come on, man.
You know I'll lie for you anytime.

01:26.005 --> 01:28.046
I will cover up dead bodies for you.

01:28.130 --> 01:32.255
But if I ask Holly to lie to your wife,
there's no way we're messing around.

01:32.338 --> 01:33.421
It's Freaky Friday!

01:33.505 --> 01:36.463
You don't have to lie,
just tell her to ignore when I'm lying.

01:36.546 --> 01:37.546
That's it.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.630
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

01:39.713 --> 01:41.088
You owe me.

01:41.171 --> 01:42.005
See you tonight.

01:45.296 --> 01:47.421
I gotta get Claritin. Claritin.

01:47.505 --> 01:49.213
Oh, my God! Look!

01:49.921 --> 01:51.505
He took her in a helicopter?

01:51.796 --> 01:53.880
My husband won't even pay for Uber Black.

01:53.963 --> 01:57.505
Yeah. I don't even--
I can't even remember the last time

01:57.588 --> 02:01.213
that Nick did anything
even remotely romantic.

02:01.463 --> 02:04.505
I mean, he used to leave me,
like, cute little mixtapes,

02:04.755 --> 02:06.671
little love notes in the bathroom.

02:06.755 --> 02:07.963
Love notes are dead.

02:08.045 --> 02:09.380
When my husband wants to have sex,

02:09.463 --> 02:11.338
he just texts me the eggplant
and doughnut emoji.

02:11.671 --> 02:13.171
Eggplant and doughnut--

02:14.088 --> 02:15.588
Oh. He's the eggplant.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.838
More like a fingerling potato.

02:17.921 --> 02:19.255
It doesn't take that much.

02:19.338 --> 02:21.713
There are guys at the intersection
selling flowers.

02:21.796 --> 02:24.255
You just roll down the window,
grab a bunch, bring 'em home.

02:24.338 --> 02:27.171
- I mean, they couldn't make it any easier.
- No kidding.

02:27.255 --> 02:29.630
I mean, tomorrow
is our 15th wedding anniversary.

02:30.171 --> 02:33.338
I'm still waiting on that trip to Europe
he promised me on our wedding day.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.255
- That's been 15 years?
- Yeah.

02:35.338 --> 02:37.296
I could have walked to Europe by now.

02:37.380 --> 02:38.921
You know, you just have to tell him.

02:39.005 --> 02:42.796
I just don't want to have to tell him.
I just want him to know.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.588
- No, they never just know.
- I know.

02:44.671 --> 02:46.755
- That doesn't happen.
- You have to tell men everything.

02:46.838 --> 02:49.171
If you want the dishes to not go
in the sink, you have to tell them.

02:49.255 --> 02:51.171
If you want him to shower
before he comes to bed,

02:51.255 --> 02:52.505
- you have to ask him.
- Ugh.

02:52.588 --> 02:54.963
That's why they have those signs
in bathrooms at restaurants

02:55.046 --> 02:57.046
to tell employees to wash their hands.

02:57.130 --> 02:59.296
Those aren't for women, guys.
Those are for men.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.380
Or maybe you could just text him,
airplane, wine glass,

03:02.463 --> 03:05.380
Italian flag, eggplant,
doughnut, doughnut, doughnut.

03:24.921 --> 03:26.005
Let's go with the 50.

03:31.213 --> 03:32.296
Claritin...

03:40.213 --> 03:41.088
Hi, welcome.

03:41.796 --> 03:42.713
Thank you.

03:42.838 --> 03:44.421
Thanks a lot.

03:44.505 --> 03:47.046
Are you gonna tell 'em
about the stuff in your backpack?

03:47.380 --> 03:49.296
Mind your own business, man.
I'm paying for this.

03:49.838 --> 03:51.713
I like your sneakers.
They must be expensive.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.963
Is that why can't afford
the Monster Energy Drink

03:54.046 --> 03:55.546
or the Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

03:56.796 --> 03:59.046
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Hey, let go of me, man.

04:01.088 --> 04:02.421
I can't believe I was right.

04:03.088 --> 04:05.463
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll mess you up, old man.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.005
Old man. Oh, my God.

04:07.088 --> 04:08.171
First of all,

04:08.630 --> 04:11.630
I should throw you in jail
just for calling me "old man,"

04:11.713 --> 04:13.713
but you bring that stuff back,

04:13.796 --> 04:17.005
I'll let you go 'cause I'm late
for dinner and I'm hungry as shit.

04:17.296 --> 04:18.171
Go ahead.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.296
- Tylenol PM? Am I right?
- No.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.171
It's not good for that.
It depends on what time of year you go.

04:26.255 --> 04:28.005
That makes sense.
Can I get another?

04:28.296 --> 04:29.755
We're gonna have another one?

04:29.838 --> 04:33.463
I'm just saying, we're paying today.
Maybe you can take it easy a little bit.

04:33.546 --> 04:36.046
Hey, hey. Nick. Nick.
What-- What's wrong with you?

04:36.130 --> 04:38.796
Sorry. Should I not order
another drink, Detective?

04:39.421 --> 04:40.755
No. Holly, order another drink.

04:40.838 --> 04:43.130
Order as much as you want.
I was joking around.

04:43.213 --> 04:44.421
- That's not funny.
- The reason--

04:44.505 --> 04:47.255
I'm just in a great mood
because I had a great day today.

04:47.338 --> 04:50.130
- Did we have a great day or what?
- It was a fabulous day. Incredible day.

04:50.213 --> 04:52.380
Really? Did you get another hot case?

04:52.755 --> 04:53.588
Of what?

04:53.671 --> 04:55.296
"What."

04:55.380 --> 04:56.796
That was good. No, listen.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.463
Going great, kid. I promise you.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.921
It's like, uh, they're trusting me
more and more,

05:01.005 --> 05:03.213
and I, um, I wish I could tell you
what it was,

05:03.296 --> 05:04.546
but it's-- it's confidential.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.421
- Wait a second.
- What?

05:06.505 --> 05:07.630
Oh, my God.

05:07.713 --> 05:09.588
- What is this?
- What is that?

05:09.671 --> 05:12.421
My baby Jimmy got it for me
for my birthday.

05:12.505 --> 05:13.338
- Jimmy!
- What?

05:13.421 --> 05:16.130
- Celebration diamonds.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:16.213 --> 05:17.838
- It's gorgeous!
- Thank you, Audrey.

05:17.921 --> 05:19.380
- Very expensive.
- Wow, Jimmy.

05:19.921 --> 05:22.880
I got you something special.
I promise, you're gonna be very happy.

05:22.963 --> 05:24.255
- Really?
- I can't wait.

05:24.338 --> 05:27.671
See, I would've pegged you, Nick,
as an Amazon gift card kinda guy,

05:27.755 --> 05:29.630
but... I'm no detective.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.755
Hey! You know what, guys?

05:32.838 --> 05:36.546
Let's toast to my friends,
Nick and Audrey.

05:36.630 --> 05:37.963
Fifteen wonderful years.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.046
Absolutely.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.338
- Fifteen.
- Here's to true love, guys.

05:41.421 --> 05:42.255
Fifteen.

05:42.338 --> 05:43.171
- True love.
- Yeah.

05:50.005 --> 05:53.630
Dinner was insane, but that's expected.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.171
But I'll tell you what,

05:56.255 --> 05:58.880
I want to record Holly
chewing her ice cubes,

05:58.963 --> 06:01.421
use it as my alarm in the morning.
That's--

06:01.505 --> 06:03.921
Guarantee me of wanting to
wake up and leave.

06:08.588 --> 06:10.796
What's the matter?
You didn't like that joke?

06:13.171 --> 06:14.338
I'm flossing.

06:14.421 --> 06:15.713
I can see that.

06:16.671 --> 06:18.421
You're doing it extra hard tonight.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.046
And I'm not sleeping with
the fan on tonight. I hate that sound.

06:22.463 --> 06:24.963
No fan necessary.
We'll crank the AC, babe.

06:29.463 --> 06:30.880
Uh-oh. What, what, what?

06:30.963 --> 06:32.838
You're gonna yell at me?
I can see this. Hang on.

06:32.921 --> 06:34.713
Why don't you do some more angry flossing?

06:35.546 --> 06:37.880
How come we haven't gone to Europe, Nick?

06:38.796 --> 06:40.130
You have to explain this to me.

06:40.921 --> 06:42.005
We never go anywhere.

06:42.088 --> 06:44.921
We travel.
I took you to the Poconos that time.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.255
What? The Poco-- That was--

06:46.338 --> 06:47.755
That was for a funeral, Nick.

06:48.171 --> 06:50.630
How about, uh, when we went to Virginia

06:50.713 --> 06:52.963
when my uncle was in a hospice
and we got to see him die?

06:53.046 --> 06:54.630
- We did that.
- Ugh, Nick. Come on.

06:54.713 --> 06:56.171
I'm talking about the postcard.

06:56.255 --> 06:59.338
- You don't remember that?
- I remember it. Of course I remember it.

06:59.838 --> 07:02.921
It's been 15 years, Nick.
I don't know what we're waitin' for.

07:05.963 --> 07:08.546
Now you've gone and done it, Audrey.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.296
What? What'd I do?

07:12.005 --> 07:14.005
I told you I had something big
for you at dinner,

07:14.088 --> 07:16.255
and you couldn't wait till
tomorrow morning?

07:17.588 --> 07:18.463
No.

07:19.796 --> 07:22.005
We're finally going to Europe.
Happy anniversary.

07:22.588 --> 07:25.088
Oh, my God. I have chills.

07:25.171 --> 07:28.005
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:28.088 --> 07:30.130
Oh, my God! I'm so--

07:30.630 --> 07:33.130
- I ruined your surprise!
- Shh. You didn't ruin anything.

07:33.213 --> 07:35.255
You're the greatest. You deserve it.
I love you.

07:35.338 --> 07:37.880
- I love you!
- It's still a surprise. I swear.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.921
- We can afford it, right? This is all--
- We can afford it, of course.

07:45.005 --> 07:46.505
- Okay.
- I'm getting my raise this year.

07:46.588 --> 07:48.255
- Right.
- We're all set. Come on.

07:48.671 --> 07:50.046
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.921
So, uh, we are on our honeymoon,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.546
and I was wondering
if we could possibly get an upgrade

07:54.630 --> 07:57.005
because I have miles. Maybe--

07:57.088 --> 08:00.380
I don't even know if it's from
this airline, but do they expire, or--

08:00.463 --> 08:02.630
Sir, you would have needed
to request that in advance.

08:02.713 --> 08:04.296
- Yeah.
- Right this way, please.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.963
- Thank you. I'm so sorry.
- We did try advance. I tried calling.

08:07.046 --> 08:08.921
- And, um, nobody--
- Who'd you call?

08:09.005 --> 08:10.546
- Crazy busy signals.
- Really?

08:10.630 --> 08:12.505
- It's the busy signals!
- Who did you try to call?

08:16.838 --> 08:19.005
I don't want to give it away.
It was the butler.

08:19.088 --> 08:20.463
The butler did it.

08:21.255 --> 08:22.921
It's never the butler who did it.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.671
I don't even think there are butlers.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.921
That's just a word created
for those goofy books you're addicted to.

08:29.005 --> 08:30.963
Would you just please, please shh?

08:31.046 --> 08:34.087
Leave my books alone, okay?
Just let me read.

08:34.171 --> 08:36.212
I just like-- Makes me happy.

08:36.296 --> 08:38.171
Are you okay? You're cranky.
Are you bored?

08:38.255 --> 08:40.046
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Take a nap.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.212
- Are you okay with that?
- Wait, don't--

08:42.296 --> 08:44.963
But just, please, don't--
don't lay all the way back.

08:45.546 --> 08:46.963
- Don't take it back?
- No.

08:47.046 --> 08:48.796
Why? You don't want
my double chin to show?

08:48.880 --> 08:51.546
It's not your chins, okay. It's just rude.

08:51.630 --> 08:52.505
Yes.

08:52.588 --> 08:54.213
- Okay. 'Cause you splay out.
- All right.

08:54.296 --> 08:57.421
And then your seat is in, like,
the lap of the guy behind you.

08:57.505 --> 09:00.421
- So just be considerate of everybody.
- I'll stay up. Thank you.

09:01.255 --> 09:02.296
Timber.

09:11.005 --> 09:12.463
Oh, excuse me.

09:12.546 --> 09:13.963
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

09:14.046 --> 09:16.546
Could I please have some earplugs?

09:16.630 --> 09:17.588
Yes.

09:17.671 --> 09:18.880
For nine dollars.

09:19.338 --> 09:21.755
Nine dollars? For earplugs?

09:21.838 --> 09:22.755
Yes.

09:23.046 --> 09:24.838
That's okay. I'll just--

09:25.380 --> 09:26.630
I'll just use my peanuts.

09:28.380 --> 09:29.338
I'll just--

09:54.088 --> 09:54.921
Wow.

10:11.296 --> 10:12.380
Oh...

10:13.880 --> 10:14.880
Mm.

10:21.963 --> 10:23.796
A fellow insomniac, I see.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.880
Jesus.

10:24.963 --> 10:26.213
Yes. I--

10:26.796 --> 10:28.588
Yep. I know, right?

10:28.671 --> 10:30.796
I just cannot sleep on these things.

10:31.046 --> 10:32.671
So what brings you across the pond?

10:32.755 --> 10:35.713
Actually, it's my-- it's my honeymoon.

10:35.796 --> 10:37.296
Oh. Congratulations.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.171
- Thank you.
- Where's your husband?

10:39.755 --> 10:40.630
Dead.

10:41.171 --> 10:43.713
Asleep. He's dead-- dead asleep.

10:43.796 --> 10:45.838
We've actually been married for 15 years,

10:45.921 --> 10:49.338
but we just have been very, very,
very, very busy.

10:49.588 --> 10:52.838
Then a toast to the whirlwind
that is your life.

10:54.046 --> 10:55.088
Yes.

10:55.171 --> 10:56.338
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Oh, yes!

10:56.421 --> 10:58.380
The bar is for
first class passengers only.

10:58.463 --> 11:00.880
Of course. Of course it is.
I'm so sorry, yes.

11:00.963 --> 11:04.130
I will head back to the lower class cabin

11:04.213 --> 11:06.421
and sit where I should and, uh...

11:06.963 --> 11:07.921
shovel some coal.

11:08.005 --> 11:09.130
She's my guest.

11:09.213 --> 11:11.880
Unfortunately, sir,
she'd need her own first class ticket.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.296
Charles Cavendish.

11:14.463 --> 11:15.671
I'm so sorry, sir.

11:19.588 --> 11:20.588
Whoa!

11:21.505 --> 11:22.963
Charles Cavendish?

11:23.505 --> 11:24.421
Is that your real name?

11:24.505 --> 11:26.005
I'm afraid so.

11:26.088 --> 11:28.671
I mean, that sounds like
it just fell right out of a...

11:28.755 --> 11:29.921
mystery novel.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.463
And which character would I be?

11:33.546 --> 11:35.880
Name like that,
you'd have to be the bad guy.

11:37.546 --> 11:38.380
Well...

11:39.213 --> 11:40.421
here's to the bad guys.

11:56.838 --> 11:59.088
- Okay, so your fiancée...
- Hm.

11:59.796 --> 12:00.796
...leaves you...

12:01.796 --> 12:05.130
...for your elderly uncle--

12:05.213 --> 12:07.755
Will you two kindly shut up?

12:07.838 --> 12:09.005
Oh, be quiet.

12:09.505 --> 12:12.588
Or we shall tell everyone about the ferret
you've smuggled in here.

12:14.046 --> 12:16.921
The whole thing is tawdry, I know.

12:17.005 --> 12:18.921
- Tawdry.
- He desired my betrothed,

12:19.005 --> 12:21.671
and Uncle Malcolm always gets
what he wants.

12:21.755 --> 12:23.713
Malcolm. Uncle Malcolm.

12:24.296 --> 12:25.338
- Quince.
- Uncle--

12:26.130 --> 12:29.463
Malcolm Quince is your uncle?
That billionaire?

12:29.796 --> 12:31.796
- That's the one.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:32.546 --> 12:34.963
He looks just like this...

12:35.755 --> 12:39.296
if this wrinkled olive had $70 billion.

12:40.213 --> 12:41.546
Seventy billion dollars.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.213
I'm traveling to Monaco with the newlyweds
on his yacht

12:44.296 --> 12:45.838
for the Grand Prix this weekend.

12:46.171 --> 12:48.005
Why? Why would you do that?

12:48.088 --> 12:50.296
Why would you go on their yacht
after what they just did?

12:50.380 --> 12:52.296
Because I'm English, Mrs. Spitz.

12:52.963 --> 12:55.171
- I'm a glutton for social masochism.
- Oh.

12:55.255 --> 12:59.880
And I plan on getting blind drunk
and ruining the festivities.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.046
Okay. I support that.

13:03.380 --> 13:05.213
- I say, Audrey...
- Hm.

13:06.255 --> 13:08.880
Do you and your husband
have plans this weekend?

13:13.713 --> 13:16.171
You made a joke. That's--

13:17.796 --> 13:20.838
Holy shit! This plane has a bar?

13:20.921 --> 13:22.963
Sir, this is the first class lounge.

13:23.046 --> 13:25.005
I'm gonna have to ask you
to return to your seat.

13:25.088 --> 13:26.421
There's bars on planes now?

13:26.505 --> 13:28.421
Planes have bars now. In first class.

13:28.505 --> 13:31.505
This is-- Man, I wish my mother was
still alive to see this.

13:31.588 --> 13:33.171
She was an alcoholic, but a nice one.

13:33.255 --> 13:35.713
Sir, if you don't return to your seat,
I'm gonna have to call--

13:35.796 --> 13:36.671
The cops.

13:37.255 --> 13:38.213
So that's my wife

13:38.296 --> 13:41.838
talking to that handsome guy over there
with the one chin.

13:42.171 --> 13:46.046
So I'm gonna go break that shit up,
possibly grab myself a beer,

13:46.130 --> 13:47.421
maybe you a Xanax.

13:49.505 --> 13:51.796
...the wine on board is worth a letter.

13:52.630 --> 13:54.796
People don't write letters
anymore, do they?

13:55.338 --> 13:58.421
- Such a pity.
- It's just, it's all so tactical.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.338
Yeah, that's true.

14:01.796 --> 14:02.671
Hey!

14:02.755 --> 14:03.588
Nick.

14:03.671 --> 14:06.380
- How are you?
- Hi, honey. You're awake.

14:06.838 --> 14:08.171
- Was your nappie good?
- Been awake.

14:08.255 --> 14:09.838
- I was looking for you.
- I know, I'm--

14:09.921 --> 14:12.296
- Well, I met this lovely gentleman.
- Oh, yeah?

14:12.380 --> 14:14.755
I'd like you to meet Charles Cavendish.

14:14.838 --> 14:16.421
- He's a lord. Right?
- How do you do?

14:16.505 --> 14:18.588
- A lord?
- Well, actually a viscount.

14:18.671 --> 14:21.088
- Oh.
- Although viscounts are addressed as Lord,

14:21.171 --> 14:23.713
which probably accounts
for the lovely Audrey's confusion.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.921
There you go.
She gets confused with me too.

14:26.005 --> 14:28.546
Sometimes I'm the king.
Sometimes I'm Daddy.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.546
So... can I get a Labatts, brother?

14:32.505 --> 14:33.796
That'll be 17 euro.

14:33.880 --> 14:35.130
No, no, no. Please.

14:35.213 --> 14:36.380
The beer is on me.

14:36.463 --> 14:39.171
I'm not just taking a beer
from somebody I don't know.

14:39.255 --> 14:40.255
Oh, my gosh.

14:40.338 --> 14:44.338
And I do hope you take advantage
of my other offer.

14:44.421 --> 14:46.421
Hey. I'm not just gonna stand here

14:46.505 --> 14:49.130
while you offer to pay me
to have sex with my wife.

14:49.213 --> 14:51.213
But out of curiosity,
how much are we talking?

14:51.296 --> 14:52.463
- Great.
- I wouldn't do it.

14:52.546 --> 14:54.171
- Hey, listen to me.
- What?

14:54.255 --> 14:58.130
He is inviting us to spend the weekend
with him on a yacht with his family.

14:58.213 --> 14:59.630
Well, we have plans.

15:00.088 --> 15:01.630
On a bus.

15:01.713 --> 15:05.296
A bus that is bound
for the idyllic village of San Grigio,

15:05.380 --> 15:09.630
where we can watch a demonstration
on how they age ham.

15:09.713 --> 15:11.963
- Let me explain something.
- Tell me what I'm missing.

15:12.046 --> 15:13.005
- Are you kidding me?
- Go.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.421
We would be sailing
around European harbors.

15:16.505 --> 15:18.671
- Yeah.
- Okay? We'd be eating fresh fish.

15:18.755 --> 15:20.505
- Right.
- And we'd be drinking wine.

15:20.588 --> 15:21.963
- Hmm.
- We'd be together.

15:22.046 --> 15:22.921
That's nice.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.838
- They have a chef.
- They have a chef.

15:24.921 --> 15:26.630
His name is Maurice. Maurice?

15:26.713 --> 15:28.296
- Maurice, yes.
- Maurice.

15:28.713 --> 15:30.546
"Some people call me Maurice."

15:32.380 --> 15:33.296
Remember that one?

15:34.130 --> 15:35.630
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

15:36.671 --> 15:37.880
I gotcha.

15:37.963 --> 15:38.921
So listen--

15:39.005 --> 15:40.130
What are you doing?

15:40.213 --> 15:43.838
Why would two adults come into a bathroom
on an airplane?

15:43.921 --> 15:46.421
Honey, come on.
To have a private conversation.

15:46.505 --> 15:47.588
Ah, that's funny.

15:47.671 --> 15:49.630
Listen. I'm just trying to understand

15:49.713 --> 15:53.463
why you are turning down
the opportunity of a lifetime.

15:53.546 --> 15:55.171
Because I don't trust that guy.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.671
- Why?
- 'Cause instincts.

15:57.755 --> 15:58.588
Your instincts?

15:58.671 --> 16:01.088
The same ones that told you
you were about to get laid in here?

16:01.630 --> 16:02.505
I'm not getting laid?

16:02.588 --> 16:06.421
Come on! When is the next time you and I
are gonna be able to get on a yacht?

16:06.505 --> 16:09.380
I'm just saying, all those times
we're eating ham sandwiches

16:09.463 --> 16:12.255
and you're always asking,
"How do they age the ham?"

16:12.338 --> 16:14.505
- Never had that--
- We'll never ask that question again

16:14.588 --> 16:16.671
- because we'll be in San Grigio.
- That never happened.

16:16.755 --> 16:19.921
They'll give us the reason
on how they do it so perfectly.

16:20.421 --> 16:21.880
Okay. You wanna know the truth?

16:21.963 --> 16:23.338
- You're breaking my heart.
- Why?

16:23.421 --> 16:24.796
I feel like a schmuck

16:24.880 --> 16:28.421
because I've been working my ass off
and saving money, and now you know why.

16:28.505 --> 16:31.088
It was to take us on this trip.
And I know I'm not a duke.

16:31.171 --> 16:33.005
I understand. He's a viscount, but--

16:33.088 --> 16:35.421
- I don't even know what that is.
- I know. It's okay.

16:36.088 --> 16:37.046
I'm sorry.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.005
I love you.

16:38.088 --> 16:40.505
- I got lost. I got swept up in it.
- I know.

16:40.588 --> 16:42.880
But it's okay. We're gonna do the bus.
It's gonna be great.

16:42.963 --> 16:44.630
We'll do the bus.
You're gonna love the bus!

16:49.338 --> 16:53.255
Hey! Hey, Gonzales.
Where is our welcome glass of champagne?

16:53.338 --> 16:55.130
- We were promised...
- Summer hit me!

16:55.213 --> 16:57.130
...a glass of champagne when we arrived...

16:57.213 --> 17:00.380
Zip it! Both of you! Will you stop that?

17:00.463 --> 17:01.963
I know you hear me!

17:03.296 --> 17:04.130
Shut up!

17:04.213 --> 17:05.838
Let's do the-- We'll do the yacht, okay?

17:05.921 --> 17:06.963
- Thank you.
- All right.

17:07.046 --> 17:08.380
Cavendish!

17:08.463 --> 17:10.796
We've changed our minds. We're gonna come.

17:11.255 --> 17:12.255
Splendid.

17:32.838 --> 17:34.005
- Hello.
<i>- Bienvenidos.</i>

17:34.088 --> 17:35.463
Thank you.

17:35.546 --> 17:37.130
- Thank you.
<i>- De nada.</i>

17:37.213 --> 17:38.921
- This is amazing.
<i>- Señor.</i>

17:39.005 --> 17:40.421
I thought it was gonna be bigger.

17:40.505 --> 17:41.380
- What?
- I did.

17:41.463 --> 17:43.505
- Bigger than this?
- I really did.

17:43.838 --> 17:46.130
I bet that's Cavendish's ex-fiancée

17:46.213 --> 17:47.963
who left him for his uncle.

17:48.046 --> 17:51.671
Oh, okay.
I'm starving. Where's that Maurice dude?

17:51.755 --> 17:54.296
Uh, I don't think
we're supposed to talk to him directly.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.296
- Let's wait for dinner.
- Which is when?

17:56.380 --> 17:59.338
I don't-- Honey, it's later.
I don't know. It's Europe, okay?

17:59.421 --> 18:02.671
The bus observes
a standard American dinnertime, so...

18:03.130 --> 18:05.338
Oh, baby, this is like a painting.

18:05.421 --> 18:07.880
- No, it's nice--
- It just doesn't look real.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.963
- It's--
- Oh, my God!

18:10.046 --> 18:12.046
Wow. Look. She's so pretty.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.046
- Very pretty.
- She's that kind of pretty

18:14.130 --> 18:16.338
that you don't really know
what country she's from.

18:16.421 --> 18:18.505
I mean, I can't tell. Can you tell?

18:18.588 --> 18:19.505
Japan.

18:19.588 --> 18:22.463
Ah, yes, yes. You see? See?
She can hear you.

18:22.546 --> 18:24.588
She's not a-- not on television right now.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.005
- You're watching a real person.
- Shh.

18:27.380 --> 18:29.380
Crashing the party with civilians.

18:29.463 --> 18:30.505
Are you drunk?

18:30.588 --> 18:32.380
It's only noon, Suzi, darling.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.255
Of course I'm drunk.

18:34.338 --> 18:35.588
So, where is your beloved,

18:35.671 --> 18:37.296
Sir Liver Spots?

18:37.380 --> 18:38.588
Malcolm is not here yet.

18:38.671 --> 18:40.463
You know how he likes to make an entrance.

18:40.838 --> 18:44.088
You'd know more about Malcolm's entrances
than anyone at this point.

18:47.713 --> 18:50.296
- Great to meet you. You're terrific.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

18:50.380 --> 18:52.921
I'm sorry you had to see that.

18:53.005 --> 18:55.005
- Actually, I started to like you.
- She deserved that.

18:55.088 --> 18:57.838
- Very good. You came on strong.
- She is not nice. You're hurt.

18:57.921 --> 18:58.755
Charles.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.671
So glad you could make it.

19:01.255 --> 19:03.213
And you brought guests.

19:03.296 --> 19:05.588
Allow me to introduce my cousin, Tobey.

19:05.671 --> 19:08.630
Malcolm's only son
and the man Suzi would have left me for,

19:08.713 --> 19:10.046
had he not been a screaming queen.

19:10.505 --> 19:13.005
- Okay.
- Thank you for having us aboard, sir.

19:13.088 --> 19:14.296
Yeah. Hey, really nice.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.713
It's my father's boat.

19:15.796 --> 19:19.380
Oh, well, her father, uh, let me use
his lawnmower one time,

19:19.463 --> 19:21.505
- so I know how that goes.
- Yeah.

19:22.921 --> 19:24.088
How do you know Charles?

19:24.171 --> 19:26.671
Oh. We go back to six hours ago?

19:26.755 --> 19:28.296
- Yes.
- We met on an airplane.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.005
He was very nice to include us.

19:30.088 --> 19:31.963
We have a spare cabin for them, I assume.

19:32.755 --> 19:36.421
Well, seeing as you have so much history,
I'm sure we can find some room.

19:36.505 --> 19:39.005
Thank you. Thanks for the warm welcome.
Appreciate it. After you.

19:39.088 --> 19:41.838
- Up here? This keeps going up?
- Really nice of you. So we go this way?

19:41.921 --> 19:44.338
- Wow.
- There's another deck, hun. Another deck!

19:44.755 --> 19:47.463
"Sex-crazed oldster Malcolm Quince

19:47.546 --> 19:51.838
wed 23-year-old ski instructor
Suzi Nakamura this week."

19:51.921 --> 19:54.338
- Mm-hmm.
- "Why would the Tokyo-born tart

19:54.421 --> 19:56.588
trade downhills for dentures?

19:56.671 --> 20:01.046
Perhaps the $70 billion
his son, Tobey, was set to inherit."

20:01.130 --> 20:02.713
- Wow.
- Oh, my God, baby.

20:03.213 --> 20:06.088
We are literally right in the middle
of a TMZ story.

20:06.171 --> 20:10.296
You were right about this yacht.
Their shaving cream smells like coconuts.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.463
- It's incredible.
- Sorry.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.255
You're allergic to rich people now?

20:14.338 --> 20:18.130
No. Stop it! I'm allergic to stuff.
Would you please grab me the Claritin?

20:18.213 --> 20:19.546
Yes. Here.

20:20.921 --> 20:24.130
Baby, that's Allegra.
You said you packed Claritin.

20:24.213 --> 20:25.171
That's the same thing.

20:25.255 --> 20:27.380
No, honey. Allegra doesn't work for me.

20:27.838 --> 20:28.671
Oh.

20:29.380 --> 20:32.838
Okay. When we get to Monaco,
I'll get you your Claritin.

20:32.921 --> 20:35.380
It's not-- It's gonna be called
something else over there,

20:35.463 --> 20:38.171
I'm telling you.
Just remember, we-- The blue box.

20:38.255 --> 20:42.588
You know, "Allegra" in, uh, French
means the same shit as Claritin.

20:44.630 --> 20:45.755
- Smile.
- Yes.

20:45.838 --> 20:48.380
You need to stop drinking. You're a drunk.

20:48.463 --> 20:49.505
Look at him.

20:49.588 --> 20:52.963
Why is he torturing himself like that?
I mean, she's already married to Malcolm.

20:53.338 --> 20:55.588
I don't know what else
he's expecting her to say to him.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.505
She's saying he's a cad...

20:57.921 --> 20:59.796
...and he's saying she's a tramp,

20:59.880 --> 21:01.046
and they're both right.

21:01.338 --> 21:03.213
How do I know you? You're--

21:03.296 --> 21:04.463
You're an actress, right?

21:04.546 --> 21:06.505
All women are actresses, dear.

21:06.921 --> 21:09.046
I'm just clever enough to get paid for it.

21:09.630 --> 21:10.505
Grace Ballard.

21:11.088 --> 21:12.463
Oh!

21:12.546 --> 21:13.713
My God!

21:14.213 --> 21:17.630
That's-- This is incr--
I'm a massive fan of yours!

21:17.713 --> 21:19.713
- Like, number one!
- Oh.

21:19.796 --> 21:21.546
- This isn't--
- I know. It's incredible.

21:21.630 --> 21:25.130
I am Nick Spitz. This is my wife, Allison.

21:25.213 --> 21:27.338
- I can't believe--
- Aud-- Audrey. I'm Audrey.

21:27.421 --> 21:28.921
- I said Audrey!
- No, you didn't.

21:29.005 --> 21:31.505
Allison is the character
she played in the--

21:31.588 --> 21:33.880
Remember the one?
We watched it together.

21:33.963 --> 21:36.088
Where it's a beautiful lady,
it turns out she's a robot?

21:36.171 --> 21:37.671
- And there's the bra--
- She's the robot!

21:37.755 --> 21:39.880
- There's guns coming out of your bra.
- Yes!

21:39.963 --> 21:41.963
<i>Sex Machina.</i> My breakout role.

21:42.046 --> 21:45.171
So good.
Look at this, right in front of us!

21:45.255 --> 21:47.338
I feel like I got kicked
in the belly right now!

21:47.421 --> 21:49.255
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
- I lost my wind!

21:49.546 --> 21:51.546
Let's go put on some sunscreen
'cause it's--

21:51.630 --> 21:53.296
You already put the sunscreen
on me earlier.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.713
No, we're gonna-- we're gonna
reapply the sunscreen.

21:55.796 --> 21:57.505
- We're putting more on?
- We're gonna reapply.

21:57.588 --> 21:58.796
All right. We'll put more on.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.963
- So nice to meet you.
- I can't believe-- This is great!

22:01.046 --> 22:02.630
- He's so excited.
- We're on the same ship!

22:05.255 --> 22:08.130
Look at that. It says that her last name
isn't even really Ballard.

22:08.213 --> 22:09.255
Well, so what?

22:09.838 --> 22:11.671
How do you just come out
looking that beautiful?

22:12.171 --> 22:14.380
- Oh, she's had it all done.
- What?

22:14.713 --> 22:17.005
Lips, nose, chin.

22:17.088 --> 22:18.088
No!

22:18.171 --> 22:20.130
People really get their chins done?

22:20.213 --> 22:21.588
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh!

22:21.671 --> 22:23.963
That was so directed at me,
it was disgusting.

22:24.046 --> 22:26.046
You want me to get my chin done.
And I'm not--

22:26.130 --> 22:28.880
I love you for who you are.
Although it's an option.

22:28.963 --> 22:31.046
Would you guys excuse me for a moment?

22:31.130 --> 22:33.713
- I should say hello to the Maharajah.
- Absolutely.

22:33.796 --> 22:35.838
- Everyone's saying it.
- Do you believe we're on a boat

22:35.921 --> 22:38.880
where the guy said, "I'm gonna go have
a conversation with the Maharajah?"

22:38.963 --> 22:40.671
- That was big.
- Is this real?

22:40.755 --> 22:41.588
Excuse me, ma'am?

22:41.671 --> 22:44.255
Is there a Maurice here?
'Cause I'm hungry as hell.

22:44.338 --> 22:45.463
Yes, sir. He's preparing.

22:45.546 --> 22:47.338
He's preparing. Okay.
Is he ever gonna finish?

22:47.671 --> 22:49.588
Please tell Maurice
to step on the gas.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.880
- Oh, honey, honey, honey.
- Mm-hmm?

22:52.963 --> 22:56.630
Okay, um, don't look right now,
but there's a really scary man

22:56.713 --> 22:58.088
- with an eye patch...
- Mm-hmm?

22:58.171 --> 23:00.088
...who's just staring right at us.

23:00.171 --> 23:02.130
I said don't look and you can't not do it.

23:02.213 --> 23:03.880
You say eye patch and scary,
I'm gonna look.

23:03.963 --> 23:05.713
I'm sorry.
It's physically impossible not to.

23:05.796 --> 23:07.588
All right. Okay.
He's walking at us.

23:07.671 --> 23:09.213
- Honey, honey.
- Play it cool.

23:09.296 --> 23:11.380
- Hey, fellas. What's up? How are ya?
- Hey. Hi.

23:11.463 --> 23:13.505
- Who let you two on board?
- Excuse me?

23:13.588 --> 23:14.880
What is happening right now?

23:14.963 --> 23:16.963
They're my guests, Colonel.

23:17.046 --> 23:19.421
- This weekend is for family only.
- Really?

23:19.505 --> 23:21.588
The last time I checked,
you're not family.

23:21.963 --> 23:24.171
Neither is Soviet Chewbacca over there.

23:24.838 --> 23:25.796
Nick, Audrey.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.505
- Yeah, you're not family for sure.
- Okay.

23:27.588 --> 23:30.296
Jesus. So I see one of them
was packing heat.

23:30.380 --> 23:33.213
- Was I supposed to bring a gun?
- Oh, I doubt it's even loaded.

23:33.296 --> 23:36.713
That's Colonel Charles Ulenga
of the Namibian Defense Force.

23:36.796 --> 23:37.838
Malcolm's best friend.

23:37.921 --> 23:40.296
He saved his life
from a bombing attempt in '94.

23:40.755 --> 23:42.380
That's where he lost his eye and his--

23:42.463 --> 23:44.130
And his dick? Did he lose his dick?

23:44.213 --> 23:47.005
- Honey, why?
- I thought that maybe it was his dick.

23:47.505 --> 23:51.338
And that's Sergei Radjenko,
former Spetsnaz, and his bodyguard.

23:52.005 --> 23:53.796
Crazy eye patch guy needs a bodyguard?

23:55.130 --> 23:56.588
Whoa! The hand!

23:56.671 --> 23:59.338
There's a hand.
It's not on his body anymore.

24:00.213 --> 24:02.171
Oh, look at this.
Now he's smoking his dick!

24:02.255 --> 24:04.880
- He's smoking his dick!
- No. Oh, God. Would you stop it?

24:04.963 --> 24:07.255
I'm just having fun. It's a boat.

24:08.213 --> 24:09.546
Can I ask you a question?

24:09.630 --> 24:12.630
What exactly... is a maharajah?

24:12.713 --> 24:14.005
Why don't you ask him yourself?

24:14.088 --> 24:14.921
No.

24:15.005 --> 24:17.713
Vik, I have some guests
I'd like you to meet.

24:17.796 --> 24:19.421
Nick and Audrey Spitz,

24:20.046 --> 24:24.671
I present the exalted Maharajah
Vikram Shivan Govindan of Mumbai.

24:24.755 --> 24:26.921
- Oh, my gosh. It's so--
- Hey.

24:28.588 --> 24:29.963
So nice to--

24:32.463 --> 24:33.713
- Nice--
- We're--

24:36.755 --> 24:40.421
Yo-ho-ho! That was very hilarious. Ah!

24:40.505 --> 24:42.213
With all the bowin' and shit.

24:42.296 --> 24:45.088
You know, when a brown person bows,
white people bow back, innit?

24:45.171 --> 24:47.046
- Up high. How about--
- I'm sorry.

24:47.130 --> 24:48.755
He's giving you-- Respect!

24:48.838 --> 24:51.296
- That was very good. Very funny.
- That was a joke.

24:51.380 --> 24:53.296
Audrey has a question
she'd like to ask you.

24:53.588 --> 24:55.005
Let me hear it.

24:55.088 --> 24:59.588
Oh. We were actually wondering,
what exactly is a maharajah?

24:59.671 --> 25:01.880
How do you--
Do you have to go to a school for that?

25:01.963 --> 25:03.546
Yeah, I was born into the game.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.713
- Oh, you're born into it.
- Okay, born into it.

25:06.796 --> 25:07.880
What do you do, Nick?

25:07.963 --> 25:10.088
- I am--
- Nick's a detective.

25:10.171 --> 25:12.463
Tight! You ever wet up anyone?

25:12.546 --> 25:14.755
- What's that?
- Yeah, you know, like drill,

25:14.838 --> 25:17.546
bust a cap, waste. You're like...

25:17.630 --> 25:19.671
- He's funny. No, never shot anybody.
- No! God!

25:19.755 --> 25:20.630
Which is a good thing.

25:20.713 --> 25:23.713
Nick is-- Well, it's just that
you're a terrible shot.

25:23.796 --> 25:24.963
He's a terrible shot.

25:25.046 --> 25:26.838
He barely got out of the academy

25:26.921 --> 25:30.796
because he couldn't even meet, like,
his minimum marksmanship skills.

25:31.880 --> 25:33.796
Audrey is lactose intolerant.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.505
- She also burps in her sleep.
- What?

25:35.588 --> 25:38.505
I just thought 'cause we are discussing
each other's flaws right now,

25:38.588 --> 25:39.963
you wanted to put it on the table.

25:40.046 --> 25:43.213
I'm sorry I-- Listen, I didn't think
that was a sensitive subject--

25:43.296 --> 25:46.130
It's not a sensitive subject,
I just don't like you telling

25:46.213 --> 25:48.630
- everybody we meet.
- I'm sorry I brought it up. Never mind.

26:17.963 --> 26:20.255
- Whoa.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

26:20.338 --> 26:22.380
- Look at this crazy.
- Wow. Babe.

26:22.463 --> 26:24.963
Well, this room is as nice
as the way you look.

26:25.046 --> 26:28.463
- You look stunning.
- Thank you, honey. That's so sweet.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.630
What?

26:31.713 --> 26:33.088
Everybody's in tuxedos.

26:33.171 --> 26:35.588
- I wish you'd let me pack.
- I shoulda wore socks. You're right.

26:35.671 --> 26:38.630
- Yo! Juan Carlos!
- Hey!

26:38.713 --> 26:41.046
- Oh, good luck, man.
- Hey.

26:41.130 --> 26:44.380
Hi. Hi, there.
What are we wishing you good luck for?

26:44.463 --> 26:47.921
Well, he is racing
in the Monaco Grand Prix tomorrow.

26:48.005 --> 26:49.796
Wow. That's big.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.005
Juan Carlos Rivera,
let me introduce you to--

26:55.171 --> 26:57.546
Steve and Lady Steve.

26:58.130 --> 26:59.130
- What?
- No.

26:59.213 --> 27:01.130
- No, no.
- I mean, if you want.

27:01.213 --> 27:03.505
- Just met us once.
- Yeah, all right. I'm gonna...

27:03.588 --> 27:04.588
- I'm Audrey.
- ...go again.

27:04.671 --> 27:06.338
I'm Nick, and then we're the Spitzes.

27:06.421 --> 27:07.880
Juan Carlos, huh?

27:07.963 --> 27:09.046
Hey, Juan Carlos.

27:09.130 --> 27:10.421
So you're a race car driver.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.796
Good, yes.

27:13.130 --> 27:15.255
Wow. How do you
get into something like that?

27:15.588 --> 27:17.588
Uh, number one, yes.

27:18.046 --> 27:19.463
You don't speak English, do you?

27:20.546 --> 27:22.671
Uh, very fast. Very fast.

27:22.755 --> 27:24.130
- Huh? Welcome.
- Okay.

27:38.296 --> 27:39.338
What's that?

27:40.088 --> 27:42.463
That is the Quince dagger.

27:43.588 --> 27:46.463
Chinese steel,
jewels from across the Orient.

27:47.005 --> 27:49.421
A gift to the family from Marco Polo,

27:49.755 --> 27:50.963
or so the legend says.

27:51.046 --> 27:51.921
God.

27:52.296 --> 27:54.796
Nick's grandmother gave us
a toaster from Sears.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.880
So the legend says.

28:08.338 --> 28:09.963
Oh, look.

28:10.046 --> 28:12.046
Here comes Daddy.

28:13.838 --> 28:14.838
What's that?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.588
Captain Wong,

28:28.046 --> 28:30.546
I'd like to address my guests privately.

28:30.796 --> 28:31.755
Certainly.

28:41.005 --> 28:41.880
My friends,

28:42.713 --> 28:45.380
welcome to the <i>Mediterranean Queen.</i>

28:45.463 --> 28:48.130
I can't tell you
how much it warms my heart

28:48.755 --> 28:50.963
that you have made this trip here

28:51.046 --> 28:52.921
to celebrate my nuptials.

28:53.005 --> 28:55.171
You will find, as you get older,

28:55.671 --> 28:57.796
that you begin to take stock of life.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.255
Not just where you've succeeded,

29:02.213 --> 29:03.505
but where you've failed.

29:05.255 --> 29:06.088
Who...

29:06.838 --> 29:07.838
you've failed.

29:15.213 --> 29:16.213
Suzi,

29:17.088 --> 29:18.380
my darling bride,

29:18.921 --> 29:21.963
who has so much of her life ahead of her.

29:23.796 --> 29:27.755
Grace, who shines so brightly
on the silver screen.

29:33.755 --> 29:36.005
Juan Carlos, my godson,

29:36.630 --> 29:39.963
who strives to lead my race team
to victory.

29:42.838 --> 29:43.838
You--

29:46.296 --> 29:47.255
Who are you?

29:48.713 --> 29:51.296
- Oh. Hey. We're the Spitzes.
- We're the--

29:51.671 --> 29:52.546
The who?

29:52.921 --> 29:55.463
Uh, I'm Audrey, and Nick Spitz.

29:55.838 --> 29:57.171
- Great.
- We love the boat.

29:57.255 --> 29:59.380
- A boat? I mean, this is a ship.
- It's beyond.

29:59.463 --> 30:01.755
- Never seen anything like this.
- Eric Lamonsoff has a boat.

30:01.838 --> 30:03.380
We go fishing. He's got a Boston Whaler.

30:03.463 --> 30:04.505
This is gigantic.

30:04.588 --> 30:06.296
They're my guests, Uncle.

30:06.588 --> 30:08.255
You brought guests?

30:08.338 --> 30:10.880
Well, you did take my plus-one.

30:11.588 --> 30:13.588
I'm so sorry. Would you like us to leave?

30:13.671 --> 30:16.046
We could-- I don't know
how we're getting out of here, though.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.921
We're-- We're out to sea.
Is there an Uber for boats?

30:19.005 --> 30:21.213
- Out-- Out of the room, Nick.
- Out of the room?

30:21.296 --> 30:22.838
We can go out of the room, absolutely--

30:22.921 --> 30:23.796
No.

30:24.380 --> 30:26.005
That won't be necessary.

30:26.338 --> 30:28.421
- Okay. So we'll stick around.
- So we stay. Okay.

30:29.213 --> 30:30.796
My nephew, Charles,

30:31.546 --> 30:33.963
who always finds a way
to keep me on my toes.

30:35.880 --> 30:39.796
My friend, the Colonel,
who's kept me safe these many years.

30:40.755 --> 30:45.963
Vikram, whose family fortunes have
always been intertwined with my own.

30:50.380 --> 30:51.963
And my Tobias.

30:52.921 --> 30:55.005
All I ever wanted was a son,

30:55.921 --> 30:57.213
and here you are.

30:58.005 --> 30:59.505
My boy.

31:03.463 --> 31:07.088
I've spoken to all of you
about your position in my will.

31:07.755 --> 31:12.005
I have thought long and hard
about what each of you is truly worth,

31:13.046 --> 31:15.171
and I've come to this conclusion.

31:16.380 --> 31:18.796
You are all leeches.

31:19.588 --> 31:20.671
Repugnant.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.255
Blood fat.

31:22.713 --> 31:27.255
Suckling on the tit of my good work
for so many years.

31:29.213 --> 31:30.546
You repulse me.

31:34.463 --> 31:36.546
Can't get this on a bus, baby.

31:36.630 --> 31:38.088
- This is incredible.
- I know it.

31:38.171 --> 31:39.296
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:39.380 --> 31:42.130
Which is why I have drafted a new will.

31:43.380 --> 31:46.005
It states that my entire fortune

31:46.671 --> 31:48.046
goes to Suzi.

31:51.838 --> 31:53.588
From this moment forth,

31:54.005 --> 31:55.463
you are all cut off.

31:56.505 --> 31:57.796
Abandoned.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.005
And perhaps,
after I've done you this kindness,

32:01.880 --> 32:05.130
you will finally be able to make
something of yourselves...

32:05.755 --> 32:06.880
on your own.

32:15.421 --> 32:18.421
Apparently, she's had enough of my caviar.

32:19.546 --> 32:21.130
- That was funny.
- Shh.

32:21.213 --> 32:22.296
Darling.

32:26.130 --> 32:27.755
You could've signed this at home.

32:28.255 --> 32:30.838
Instead, you called us here
to humiliate us?

32:30.921 --> 32:33.380
Yes, and you came running.

32:33.463 --> 32:34.671
Father, don't do this.

32:35.588 --> 32:36.796
Or what?

32:38.796 --> 32:39.838
Yes.

32:40.380 --> 32:41.755
That's what I thought.

32:55.963 --> 32:58.213
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

32:58.588 --> 33:00.046
Daddy!

33:13.630 --> 33:14.755
You shot him!

33:14.838 --> 33:16.005
No!

33:16.088 --> 33:17.546
I saw someone stab him.

33:17.630 --> 33:19.088
- Who?
- I don't know.

33:19.171 --> 33:20.380
What happened? I heard a scr--

33:21.671 --> 33:22.713
Malcolm!

33:22.796 --> 33:24.046
Oh, God!

33:24.671 --> 33:26.671
Has anybody tried to revive him?

33:26.755 --> 33:29.755
He's got a knife plunged in his heart.
I don't think he's revivable.

33:29.838 --> 33:30.838
Should we pull it out?

33:30.921 --> 33:33.171
No. It's a foot-long knife.
It's just like pulling--

33:36.963 --> 33:38.130
Oh, God!

33:38.213 --> 33:41.546
Wow! You should have left the knife in
for the po-po, Colonel, man!

33:41.630 --> 33:43.088
- I'll put it back.
- Don't put it back.

33:46.796 --> 33:49.130
Oh! Will you listen to my husband?
He's a detective.

33:49.213 --> 33:51.213
Yes, yes. What should we do, Mr. Officer?

33:51.296 --> 33:55.838
Well, for starters, let's stop removing
and reinserting the murder weapon

33:55.921 --> 33:57.380
into the victim's chest.

33:57.463 --> 34:00.005
In fact, let's stop
touching the body altogether.

34:00.088 --> 34:01.713
He was gonna take it all away.

34:03.005 --> 34:04.213
For you.

34:05.630 --> 34:06.463
Yo...

34:07.296 --> 34:08.380
Did he sign it?

34:13.045 --> 34:13.880
No.

34:13.963 --> 34:14.880
Yes!

34:14.963 --> 34:17.338
We should make sure
he doesn't have another copy on him.

34:17.630 --> 34:18.463
Uh-- Mm-mm.

34:18.545 --> 34:21.295
Rifling through the pockets of the corpse
counts as touching, yup.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.130
Sorry to single you out like that,
Ms. Ballard. You're wonderful.

34:24.213 --> 34:26.505
- You look extravagant tonight.
- Okay. What's next?

34:26.588 --> 34:28.545
We have to preserve the crime scene.

34:28.630 --> 34:31.338
Captain Wong, is there any way
you can lock off this place?

34:31.670 --> 34:32.588
Yes, of course.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.088
So we should then start
questioning the suspects.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.545
Suspects?

34:36.630 --> 34:38.213
We're not questioning anybody.

34:38.295 --> 34:40.920
Wong, when you finish locking up here,
you bring me the key.

34:41.005 --> 34:44.380
Then you radio Interpol, tell 'em
we'll meet 'em at the docks in Monaco.

34:44.463 --> 34:47.670
In the meantime, I'm gonna check
the shrimp out a little closer.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.213
For the investigation?

34:49.295 --> 34:51.463
No, Wong, because I'm hungry as shit.

34:51.545 --> 34:54.545
The rest of you, I'd lock yourselves
in your chambers or your yacht rooms

34:54.630 --> 34:55.920
because one of us...

34:57.171 --> 34:58.255
is a murderer.

35:03.796 --> 35:05.630
- Audrey.
- Yeah?

35:05.713 --> 35:07.088
Get the cocktail sauce.

35:07.713 --> 35:08.671
Yep.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.588
Wait a second. What on earth is on these?

35:34.671 --> 35:38.755
I don't know. This Maurice guy must
breastfeed each shrimp individually.

35:38.838 --> 35:40.380
I mean, they live so well.

35:40.463 --> 35:41.963
- Oh, God, yeah.
- God.

35:43.088 --> 35:44.963
All right. Where were we?
Okay, okay, okay.

35:45.546 --> 35:48.755
You know what? There had to be
two people in on the killing.

35:48.838 --> 35:51.338
Because how could they know
when the lights were gonna go out?

35:51.421 --> 35:53.255
- That's smart, that's smart.
- Right?

35:53.338 --> 35:55.505
I'm tired as hell right now.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

35:55.880 --> 35:56.880
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

35:57.296 --> 35:58.380
You're not jet-lagged?

36:02.338 --> 36:04.171
Nick.

36:04.255 --> 36:06.213
- Honey, come on, seriously.
- Huh?

36:06.296 --> 36:07.505
Who do you think did it?

36:08.546 --> 36:10.046
I don't think. I know.

36:10.796 --> 36:11.713
Who?

36:12.005 --> 36:13.255
It was the son.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.421
- Tobey.
- No.

36:15.505 --> 36:18.630
No way. Not a chance. It's too obvious.

36:18.713 --> 36:21.255
The most obvious suspect
is never, never the killer.

36:21.338 --> 36:24.671
The most obvious suspect
is always the killer.

36:24.755 --> 36:29.505
When a wife gets killed,
90% of the time it was the husband.

36:30.963 --> 36:32.755
Why did you just use that as an example?

36:33.755 --> 36:34.796
And I disagree.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.130
I think people are more complicated
than that.

36:39.171 --> 36:41.921
Judging off of what?
Those books that you read?

36:42.505 --> 36:44.921
People are simple, okay?

36:45.005 --> 36:45.963
It was Tobey.

36:46.046 --> 36:49.546
He had the most to gain,
and he also had the most to lose.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.296
Which is exactly why he's not the killer.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.921
Did you ever fool around on a boat?

36:56.463 --> 36:58.005
Do you know how much fun that could be?

36:58.088 --> 37:00.171
I just lay here
and the boat does all the work.

37:00.255 --> 37:02.546
- That's so convenient for you.
- You know I have a bad back.

37:02.630 --> 37:04.130
So convenient for you.

37:05.505 --> 37:07.046
What about the lights?

37:07.130 --> 37:10.213
Yeah, leave 'em on. I don't care.
Either way. Lady's choice.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.880
Shh! No. Who turned out those lights?

37:15.588 --> 37:17.296
What?! Oh!

37:28.046 --> 37:30.171
Don't look at me like that. I can feel it.

38:00.630 --> 38:02.546
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Will you take the Allegra?

38:02.630 --> 38:03.796
It's the same stuff.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.755
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Oh, God.

38:09.046 --> 38:11.213
Enter the brilliant
yet tortured detective,

38:11.505 --> 38:12.505
right on cue.

38:13.255 --> 38:14.380
<i>Mesdames, messieurs.</i>

38:16.421 --> 38:19.130
My name is Inspector Laurent Delacroix.

38:20.963 --> 38:25.005
I will now summon you one by one
to the grand lounge for questioning.

38:31.171 --> 38:33.713
Why is that smoke ring so good?
How did he do that?

38:36.130 --> 38:38.171
Oh, you broke it. You broke it.

38:49.838 --> 38:51.421
Tell me about Malcolm Quince.

38:51.921 --> 38:54.296
He was the most wonderful--

38:54.380 --> 38:55.505
Swine.

38:55.588 --> 38:57.630
He was the love of my life.

38:57.713 --> 38:59.838
He was a complicated man.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.963
Describe to me what happened.

39:03.546 --> 39:08.338
Yo, Mr. French Policeman, man.
It was mad. Lights went out.

39:08.421 --> 39:10.880
I thought I saw something move,
and I shot.

39:13.713 --> 39:14.630
Yes.

39:14.713 --> 39:15.546
Finish line.

39:15.630 --> 39:17.713
The old man got what was coming to him.

39:17.796 --> 39:19.546
One-eight-seven, motherfu--

39:21.796 --> 39:23.588
Did anyone touch the body?

39:25.380 --> 39:26.463
No.

39:26.546 --> 39:30.255
And did you notice anything else
out of the ordinary?

39:31.130 --> 39:33.630
- The Americans.
- Yes, number one. Yes.

39:37.588 --> 39:39.296
Aren't you gonna, um...

39:39.380 --> 39:40.838
Aren't you gonna separate us?

39:42.838 --> 39:43.713
<i>Pardon?</i>

39:44.171 --> 39:45.880
- For the interrogation.
- Okay.

39:45.963 --> 39:47.588
Question us separately, see if our...

39:47.671 --> 39:49.505
- What are you doing?
- ...answers match.

39:49.588 --> 39:52.380
What? I'm just saying,
our answers will match

39:52.463 --> 39:54.296
- because we're innocent.
- Yeah, that's right.

39:55.796 --> 39:56.713
There we go.

39:56.796 --> 39:59.338
God, you are really good at that.

39:59.588 --> 40:02.963
We found this in Tobey Quince's suite.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.838
A typewritten suicide note

40:05.921 --> 40:08.671
in which he confesses
to the murder of his father.

40:09.255 --> 40:10.088
Typewritten?

40:10.171 --> 40:12.338
- Mm-mm.
- That's not very common.

40:12.796 --> 40:14.546
- Very suspicious.
- Yes.

40:14.630 --> 40:17.963
Yeah, obviously someone is trying
to frame Tobey for his father's murder.

40:18.963 --> 40:21.421
- This is amazing.
- Look how excited she is.

40:21.505 --> 40:23.296
So where's your head at
with this whole thing?

40:23.380 --> 40:24.963
I mean, who are your chief suspects?

40:26.338 --> 40:27.171
You.

40:27.255 --> 40:29.255
- Woo, yes.
- Right, of course,

40:29.338 --> 40:32.713
- 'cause everybody is a suspect.
- Especially her.

40:32.796 --> 40:36.255
This is a group of friends and family
who have known each other for years.

40:36.338 --> 40:39.338
You two show up, and ten hours later,
two of them are dead.

40:40.088 --> 40:40.963
Coincidence?

40:41.463 --> 40:43.046
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

40:43.130 --> 40:44.463
- Coincidence.
- Wait. Excuse me.

40:44.546 --> 40:46.046
Are you saying that your theory

40:46.130 --> 40:50.338
is that the two of us conned our way
onto a stranger's boat at the last minute

40:50.421 --> 40:54.421
to commit premeditated murder
that benefits us in no way?

40:54.505 --> 40:55.380
That's your theory?

40:55.880 --> 40:57.421
Perhaps someone paid you to do it.

40:57.505 --> 40:59.088
- No.
- Paid us to do it?

40:59.171 --> 41:01.963
Oh, my gosh. I would love to see that.
Show me that money.

41:02.046 --> 41:04.005
Do you want to see
our bank statements?

41:04.380 --> 41:06.338
We're broke.

41:06.421 --> 41:08.380
Desperate for money. I see.

41:08.463 --> 41:10.421
Now you gave him a motive.

41:10.505 --> 41:12.671
- No, no, no. I know. Just don't...
- We did this because--

41:12.755 --> 41:14.671
- ...take my words out of context.
- We got nothing.

41:14.755 --> 41:16.171
- That's all we got, is nothing.
- No.

41:16.255 --> 41:19.546
Listen, I am talking to you,
detective to detective.

41:20.088 --> 41:21.046
We didn't do this.

41:21.130 --> 41:23.588
- You can see in my eyes. You can tell.
- Mm-mm.

41:24.088 --> 41:27.338
Perhaps I will have
that word with you independently.

41:28.130 --> 41:29.296
I di-- Hey!

41:30.630 --> 41:31.546
I can get up.

41:31.630 --> 41:32.963
Hey, okay.

41:33.046 --> 41:34.463
I'll be out in a minute.

41:34.963 --> 41:36.046
I love you.

41:36.130 --> 41:38.713
I'm sorry. She's just excited
because it's--

41:38.796 --> 41:41.213
She reads books, and this is fun for her.

41:43.546 --> 41:46.171
You wish me to believe you're innocent.

41:46.255 --> 41:48.671
Unfortunately, I do not believe liars.

41:48.755 --> 41:50.255
But I'm telling you the truth.

41:50.338 --> 41:52.796
And how long
have you been lying to your wife?

41:52.880 --> 41:53.713
Excuse me?

41:54.630 --> 41:57.630
You did not think that we would
investigate your background,

41:58.088 --> 42:01.546
Sergeant Nicholas Spitz, NYPD?

42:02.005 --> 42:05.380
Failed his detective's exam three times.

42:05.463 --> 42:07.588
You are, how you do say,

42:07.671 --> 42:08.921
cop on the beat,

42:09.005 --> 42:11.088
not detective as you so claim.

42:11.838 --> 42:12.838
So I...

42:13.838 --> 42:15.421
tell people I'm a detective.

42:15.505 --> 42:16.713
There's--

42:16.796 --> 42:18.005
That's not a crime.

42:18.380 --> 42:21.213
Impersonating a detective <i>is </i> a crime.

42:21.630 --> 42:23.005
I didn't think it was a crime here.

42:23.088 --> 42:24.796
I thought maybe you guys
had different rules.

42:25.296 --> 42:27.005
That doesn't make us murderers.

42:27.088 --> 42:30.671
A broke, failed man, lying to his wife?
I think it does.

42:30.963 --> 42:33.463
You don't have any evidence.
You can't hold us.

42:33.546 --> 42:35.880
No, but I can hold these.

42:37.088 --> 42:40.588
I believe Mr. Cavendish has provided
accommodations for you

42:40.671 --> 42:43.755
at the Hotel de Savoie,
so you won't be on the street.

42:44.421 --> 42:47.380
But mark my words, Officer Spitz,

42:47.880 --> 42:51.671
I will not rest until I prove
that you committed these murders.

42:52.296 --> 42:53.255
And I...

42:54.088 --> 42:57.463
will rest, because I'm tired as shit,
at that hotel you just said.

42:57.546 --> 42:59.046
It sounds like a good one.

42:59.130 --> 43:01.713
But after I'm well-rested
and I eat breakfast--

43:01.796 --> 43:04.421
hopefully the guy cooks
as good as Maurice--

43:05.255 --> 43:07.796
I will not rest until I prove to you

43:07.880 --> 43:10.171
we have nothing to do with these murders.

43:15.005 --> 43:15.838
Juan Carlos!

43:15.921 --> 43:17.130
Juan Carlos!

43:20.671 --> 43:23.005
Charles said
that everyone's gonna be at this race,

43:23.088 --> 43:24.921
so whoever did this is gonna be there.

43:25.005 --> 43:26.296
We have to figure out who it is.

43:26.380 --> 43:29.505
I know we've gotta figure it out.
This isn't one of your books, sweetheart.

43:29.588 --> 43:32.046
I mean, it's like one of your books,
but this is real.

43:32.130 --> 43:34.255
Like, two people are dead, for real.

43:34.338 --> 43:36.255
- I know.
- There's a real killer on the real loose.

43:36.338 --> 43:37.505
Hey, babe. Relax.

43:37.588 --> 43:39.171
What's-- What's wrong with you?

43:39.255 --> 43:41.921
For real? Come on. Will you just focus...

43:42.005 --> 43:43.005
- Fine.
- ...on this with me?

43:43.088 --> 43:44.671
Um, yes. Uh...

43:44.755 --> 43:47.671
Okay. So there are three basic
motives for every murder.

43:47.755 --> 43:49.671
Yes. The first one is money.

43:49.755 --> 43:50.630
Right.

43:50.713 --> 43:52.671
Everyone was in Quince's will,
except Suzi.

43:52.755 --> 43:54.713
- Okay.
- All right. The second one is love.

43:54.796 --> 43:57.130
We know nobody loved that guy
'cause he was kind of a prick.

43:57.213 --> 43:58.296
Suzi might have loved him.

43:58.380 --> 44:00.630
- That's what you would think--
- Okay, what's the third one?

44:00.713 --> 44:01.880
- Revenge.
- Right.

44:01.963 --> 44:03.588
That's the one
we should be thinking about.

44:03.671 --> 44:06.046
I'm telling you, if we figure out
who hates this guy the most,

44:06.130 --> 44:07.005
that's our killer.

44:07.088 --> 44:08.421
Okay. Okay.

44:18.088 --> 44:20.796
So, this beard... It's incredible.

44:20.880 --> 44:23.671
Do you oil that or condition?

44:23.755 --> 44:25.255
You won't get anything out of him.

44:25.338 --> 44:26.671
Oh, my gosh.

44:26.755 --> 44:29.796
Most of his life, he's been serving men
like me and Malcolm,

44:30.130 --> 44:32.005
despite being an heir to millions.

44:32.088 --> 44:33.296
He's rich, too?

44:33.380 --> 44:35.713
He's supposed to be,
but he's one of 16 children,

44:35.796 --> 44:37.713
and he's half French.

44:37.796 --> 44:40.255
Are you familiar
with French inheritance law?

44:40.630 --> 44:41.588
Broad strokes.

44:41.671 --> 44:44.130
That Colonel guy,
he's getting on my nerves.

44:44.213 --> 44:45.796
- Yeah.
- Shit. Walking around

44:45.880 --> 44:47.463
- saying you killed both those guys.
- Huh?

44:47.546 --> 44:48.755
- Yeah.
- What?

44:48.838 --> 44:50.255
And I'm like, come on.

44:50.338 --> 44:53.963
- My man wouldn't do--
- Yo. Look, yo. I didn't do nothing, son.

44:54.046 --> 44:56.213
- It doesn't matter what the will says.
- Uh-huh.

44:56.296 --> 44:59.171
The fortune must be divided equally
among the offspring.

44:59.255 --> 45:01.088
Why do the French have such a law?

45:01.171 --> 45:05.380
Well, they do it to keep all Frenchmen
from doing what Malcolm was trying to do,

45:05.463 --> 45:07.921
and leaving everything
to their mistresses.

45:08.005 --> 45:09.046
Oh.

45:09.963 --> 45:11.380
- My theory is...
- Yeah?

45:11.755 --> 45:13.088
...Juan Carlos done it, man.

45:13.171 --> 45:14.838
What? Why would he do that?

45:14.921 --> 45:17.588
Well, Juan Carlos's dad
used to race for Malcolm.

45:17.671 --> 45:21.713
Malcolm tried to get slick on some
safety angle, and shit got overlooked.

45:21.796 --> 45:23.046
- Yeah?
- Okay.

45:24.130 --> 45:27.921
Juan Carlos's dad lost both his legs, G.

45:28.005 --> 45:29.963
Yeah, straight up.

45:30.046 --> 45:31.130
- Oh.
- Gone.

45:31.213 --> 45:32.421
So it's payback time.

45:32.505 --> 45:34.088
A hundred percent of a doubt.

45:34.755 --> 45:35.588
Wh-What?

45:35.921 --> 45:38.005
- Juan Carlos is your man.
- Oh, yeah.

45:38.088 --> 45:39.255
You guarantee that?

45:39.338 --> 45:40.338
Guarantee.

45:40.421 --> 45:41.755
Respect.

45:42.671 --> 45:44.421
Or maybe Sergei could have done it.

45:46.046 --> 45:48.213
- Yeah.
- Okay. So you're not guaranteeing it.

45:48.296 --> 45:49.588
No, not a hundred percent. No.

45:53.921 --> 45:56.088
Oh! Bless you.

45:56.755 --> 45:58.213
Would you like some Allegra?

45:58.713 --> 46:01.046
- I doubt that would be useful.
- I know.

46:01.130 --> 46:03.338
It doesn't work.
I tried to tell that to Nick.

46:06.046 --> 46:07.380
Do you need something?

46:07.963 --> 46:09.921
Uh, no. Mm-mm.

46:10.755 --> 46:13.880
The guy that throws me off the most--
Cavendish--

46:13.963 --> 46:17.921
to me, he seems like
he's compensating for something,

46:18.005 --> 46:20.046
with the <i>Great Gatsby</i> look and the jawline

46:20.130 --> 46:22.380
and the "hey, I'm so gorgeous."
Am I right?

46:22.463 --> 46:23.338
Mm-hmm.

46:23.421 --> 46:25.880
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with Charles Cavendish.

46:25.963 --> 46:27.630
- Isn't that the--
- Except...

46:28.213 --> 46:30.130
he probably murdered his uncle.

46:31.130 --> 46:32.880
Well, that's one thing wrong.

46:34.505 --> 46:36.380
<i>...comes to the checkered flag!</i>

46:36.463 --> 46:37.838
<i>It's Juan Carlos!</i>

46:38.921 --> 46:41.838
<i>Winner of this year's
Monte Carlo Grand Prix!</i>

46:41.921 --> 46:43.880
<i>I find that Suzi Nakamura very suspicious.</i>

46:43.963 --> 46:46.005
<i>She's the only one
who didn't have a motive.</i>

46:46.088 --> 46:49.005
- It was Cavendish and you know it.
- You just-- No, you just don't like him.

46:49.088 --> 46:52.005
I don't like him. I don't.
I hate his guts, but that's not it.

46:52.088 --> 46:54.838
- Did you just steal all of those?
- He's the sole blood heir.

46:54.921 --> 46:57.796
He stands to make
the biggest claim for the fortune.

46:57.880 --> 46:58.838
I want one of these.

46:58.921 --> 47:01.380
- Malcolm stole his fiancée.
- Okay.

47:01.463 --> 47:03.171
That's all three motives.

47:03.255 --> 47:05.046
Money, love, revenge.

47:05.130 --> 47:06.838
We went past it.
I don't know where we are.

47:06.921 --> 47:08.838
We're over here.
Will you please try one of these?

47:08.921 --> 47:10.796
No! Oh, my God. You know what?

47:11.296 --> 47:14.088
I think you just think it's Cavendish
'cause you're jealous of him.

47:14.171 --> 47:15.921
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

47:16.005 --> 47:17.921
- I'm jealous of him.
- You are.

47:18.005 --> 47:19.546
What? Why? What am I jealous of?

47:19.630 --> 47:22.588
What is there to be jealous--
He's rich. He's charming.

47:23.171 --> 47:24.630
He smells great.

47:24.713 --> 47:26.296
What do you mean? What's he smell like?

47:26.380 --> 47:28.880
He smells like
he just came out of the dryer.

47:32.421 --> 47:34.046
What the-- What the--

47:38.088 --> 47:39.255
No, no, no.

47:39.338 --> 47:40.838
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

47:40.921 --> 47:42.546
We should test that
for fingerprints first.

47:42.630 --> 47:44.921
Okay. Do you have
the fingerprint testing kit?

47:45.296 --> 47:46.921
- What?
- 'Cause I didn't pack mine.

47:47.005 --> 47:48.046
Is it in your bag?

47:48.130 --> 47:49.296
Stop it! Come on.

47:50.213 --> 47:51.088
Hurry.

47:51.713 --> 47:53.296
Oh, this is so crazy.

47:55.046 --> 47:56.796
Oh, God. Seriously?

47:58.921 --> 48:00.171
Oh, got it.

48:00.255 --> 48:02.088
Will you please
just go see a chiropractor?

48:02.171 --> 48:03.213
It's gonna be fine.

48:04.463 --> 48:07.296
"Come to suite 802."

48:07.380 --> 48:08.713
<i>♪ Dum, dum, dum ♪</i>

48:08.796 --> 48:11.296
- We have to go to 802.
- We're not going to 802. Stop!

48:11.380 --> 48:12.463
- Why?
- It's a trap.

48:12.546 --> 48:14.963
Why wouldn't whoever just knocked
just come in and talk to us?

48:15.255 --> 48:16.796
Maybe he's being watched by the killer.

48:16.880 --> 48:19.005
What if we're being watched by the killer?

48:19.671 --> 48:20.880
What if he was in here?

48:21.588 --> 48:23.713
Maybe he stole my Peanut M&Ms.

48:23.796 --> 48:25.755
I stole your Peanut M&Ms.

48:26.171 --> 48:27.171
You stole my Peanut M&Ms?

48:27.255 --> 48:29.463
- I wanted to see if they tasted the same!
- You got to stop eating.

48:29.546 --> 48:30.838
You're gonna gain it all back.

48:30.921 --> 48:32.713
I'm going to 802. Are you coming with me?

48:32.796 --> 48:34.463
Okay, wait. Let me just...

48:34.546 --> 48:36.546
- What?
- ...figure something out.

48:37.296 --> 48:38.380
God damn.

48:43.005 --> 48:45.338
- What are you doing?
- It's a weapon.

48:45.421 --> 48:46.296
That's a lamp.

48:46.380 --> 48:48.713
Not when I crack someone
over the head with it.

48:48.796 --> 48:50.421
Will you stop questioning everything I do.

48:50.505 --> 48:52.088
Well, everything you do is questionable.

49:01.755 --> 49:02.963
That's 808.

49:15.630 --> 49:16.505
Hello?

49:18.463 --> 49:19.463
Note sender?

49:21.963 --> 49:24.213
You told us to come to 802. Are you there?

49:26.130 --> 49:27.005
Are you dead?

49:27.921 --> 49:29.338
He might be in the bathroom.

49:34.088 --> 49:36.088
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

49:36.171 --> 49:37.463
Sit on the bed.

49:37.546 --> 49:39.255
You speak-- I thought you didn't speak.

49:39.338 --> 49:40.838
Shut up. Sit on the bed.

49:40.921 --> 49:42.171
- I'm sitting!
- Shut up. Sit down.

49:42.255 --> 49:44.921
We're gonna sit in front of the bed.
All good.

49:45.671 --> 49:47.755
I cannot keep his secrets anymore.

49:48.338 --> 49:50.088
You mean the Colonel's, right?

49:50.171 --> 49:53.588
The Colonel's secrets?
I know, it's so hard to keep secrets.

49:53.671 --> 49:55.880
It really is.
You know, I have a friend named Gwen,

49:55.963 --> 49:57.838
and she has a box
that she keeps under her bed--

49:57.921 --> 49:59.796
Look, don't give me that hairdresser shit.

50:00.130 --> 50:01.505
Just shut up. Listen.

50:02.755 --> 50:05.088
Copenhagen, 1994.

50:06.921 --> 50:08.755
We were leaving a state dinner.

50:10.713 --> 50:12.588
I did not see the bomber,

50:13.671 --> 50:15.130
but the Colonel did.

50:15.421 --> 50:16.255
Whoa.

50:16.338 --> 50:19.213
He threw his body across Mr. Quince.

50:20.338 --> 50:21.546
He was hero.

50:22.255 --> 50:25.088
For nine months,
the Colonel lay in a coma.

50:26.213 --> 50:27.630
And when he awoke,

50:28.880 --> 50:32.880
he find his eye
is not the only thing he lost.

50:32.963 --> 50:35.213
They blew off his dick.
I knew it. I knew it.

50:35.296 --> 50:37.630
- His hand. His hand, honey.
- The dick. He's saying the dick.

50:37.713 --> 50:39.213
- No, no, no.
- He doesn't have a hand!

50:39.296 --> 50:41.088
- I'm no talk about dick!
- All right.

50:42.713 --> 50:44.296
I talk about her.

50:44.380 --> 50:45.588
- Me?
- Her?

50:45.671 --> 50:46.671
No, no, no.

50:50.213 --> 50:51.588
Madeleine...

50:52.046 --> 50:53.546
LeBoutillier.

50:55.588 --> 50:58.380
The most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

50:59.296 --> 51:03.130
She was the Colonel's fiancée
when the bomb exploded.

51:04.630 --> 51:06.088
And when he awoke...

51:07.796 --> 51:09.880
she was Mr. Quince's wife.

51:10.338 --> 51:11.671
What the hell is with this guy?

51:11.755 --> 51:14.421
- What, honestly, is his problem?
- Can he get his own woman maybe once?

51:14.505 --> 51:15.838
And then she died.

51:16.130 --> 51:17.296
No!

51:17.671 --> 51:18.838
In childbirth.

51:18.921 --> 51:19.796
- No!
- Damn.

51:19.880 --> 51:21.880
The child died, too. A boy.

51:22.338 --> 51:24.671
A boy who would have inherited it all.

51:25.588 --> 51:29.088
After that, the Colonel never mentioned
Madeleine again,

51:30.921 --> 51:32.880
except for one night.

51:32.963 --> 51:34.921
On the anniversary of her death,

51:35.296 --> 51:38.088
he came to me, he was drinking. He say...

51:40.005 --> 51:40.880
"Sergei."

51:41.338 --> 51:42.630
He's doing impressions now.

51:43.046 --> 51:46.505
"If you were to kill this Mr. Quince,

51:46.588 --> 51:48.046
how would you do it?"

51:48.963 --> 51:50.130
And I say,

51:50.880 --> 51:53.338
"Find isolated place,

51:53.963 --> 51:55.838
create confusion,

51:55.921 --> 51:58.755
make sure there are others with motive."

51:59.713 --> 52:02.588
I told him how to kill the man!

52:03.005 --> 52:05.588
- Holy shit! This is incredible!
- Thank you.

52:05.671 --> 52:08.838
Okay. So the Colonel killed Malcolm
and Tobey over lost love.

52:08.921 --> 52:10.213
- Got it. Perfect.
- This is insane.

52:10.296 --> 52:12.255
Will you just say
all of that one more time,

52:12.338 --> 52:13.796
but can you say it from the top?

52:13.880 --> 52:15.963
- I've gotta do a voice memo.
- She screws this up a lot.

52:16.046 --> 52:18.338
- Just ask Siri.
- Swipe it up.

52:18.421 --> 52:19.546
- Swipe it up.
- I did swipe up.

52:19.630 --> 52:20.463
Say, "Siri,

52:20.546 --> 52:22.630
I would like to make voice memo."

52:25.921 --> 52:28.005
Get into wardrobe. You are in danger.

52:28.088 --> 52:30.546
- Get in the wardrobe, you said?
- You are in danger. Right now.

52:30.630 --> 52:32.838
- Quickly.
- Jesus. I don't know-- Ow!

52:33.463 --> 52:36.338
And whatever you hear,
do not come out till I say so.

52:36.421 --> 52:37.463
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

52:40.046 --> 52:41.630
You. What do you want?

52:42.921 --> 52:45.296
No, they're not here. You should go.

52:48.796 --> 52:50.296
Where's the lamp?

52:50.755 --> 52:53.380
- I left it outside.
- Why isn't it in here?

52:53.463 --> 52:56.088
- Now you like the lamp? You're ridiculous.
- Well, we needed--

52:56.171 --> 52:58.671
- Let me open the door.
- Wait, wait, wait!

52:58.755 --> 53:00.380
Sh.

53:03.588 --> 53:04.713
Oh, thank God.

53:05.213 --> 53:06.130
Killer...

53:06.671 --> 53:07.546
is...

53:07.630 --> 53:08.880
What?

53:10.630 --> 53:12.088
Oh, God, no! No, no, no!

53:12.171 --> 53:13.963
Oh, my God!

53:14.046 --> 53:15.505
Is he dead? Is he dead?

53:16.421 --> 53:17.296
He's dead!

53:17.963 --> 53:19.296
Do we call housekeeping?

53:19.380 --> 53:20.921
Oh! Honey!

53:21.005 --> 53:22.713
Oh, my God!

53:23.546 --> 53:24.671
Lock the door!

53:24.755 --> 53:26.171
Oh, God!

53:26.255 --> 53:27.755
Oh, my God.

53:29.421 --> 53:30.505
Go! Out of the window!

53:30.588 --> 53:33.296
What are you doing?

53:34.338 --> 53:35.880
Okay, there's a ledge.

53:35.963 --> 53:37.796
That's not a ledge, that's an edge!

53:37.880 --> 53:39.713
- Here we go.
- Oh, my God.

53:39.796 --> 53:42.838
I gotcha, a hundred percent.
A hundred percent. Slow.

53:42.921 --> 53:45.296
- Oh, right there.
- No! Oh, God.

53:45.380 --> 53:46.588
Come on.

53:46.671 --> 53:48.213
- Don't even look down.
- Oh!

53:48.296 --> 53:49.505
- Don't look down.
- Oh, my God!

53:49.588 --> 53:51.671
- Told you not to look down.
- It's so far.

53:51.755 --> 53:52.796
Oh, my God.

54:01.546 --> 54:03.921
He flosses angrier than you!

54:10.088 --> 54:11.713
We got an empty room. Jackpot.

54:11.796 --> 54:13.755
- Okay, we're gonna get up on this letter.
- Okay.

54:13.838 --> 54:15.671
Ready? Go.

54:17.588 --> 54:18.630
God!

54:18.713 --> 54:19.838
Oh, my God!

54:21.713 --> 54:23.588
- You okay? Come on.
- That was the scariest thing.

54:23.671 --> 54:26.505
- We gotta go. All right. I love you.
- Oh, my God.

54:26.588 --> 54:28.880
- I love you. I'm so scared.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

54:31.755 --> 54:34.005
Uh... What's in here? Uh...

54:35.088 --> 54:36.880
No, you're not going back out there.

54:38.046 --> 54:39.921
- Oh, yes! Finally!
- Come here.

54:40.588 --> 54:41.963
- Kiss me, Vik.
- Oh!

54:42.046 --> 54:43.755
Oh, kiss me. Kiss me here.

54:43.838 --> 54:44.921
- Where?
- Here.

54:45.005 --> 54:47.380
- God, I love it. Quick, get me to the bed.
- Jesus Christ.

54:47.463 --> 54:48.630
- Get up.
- Yes!

54:48.713 --> 54:51.671
I'm gonna drink you up
like a milkshake without a straw!

54:51.755 --> 54:53.296
Yeah. Wow!

54:53.380 --> 54:54.880
- That's right.
- Vanilla milkshake!

54:54.963 --> 54:56.838
Vanilla, chocolate, whatever!

54:56.921 --> 54:57.796
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

54:57.880 --> 54:59.088
- Here we go!
- Wow!

54:59.171 --> 55:02.088
Yeah! I hope the hotel's
got insurance for these springs

55:02.171 --> 55:03.630
'cause I'm gonna bust this bed up.

55:03.713 --> 55:04.671
Oh, my God!

55:04.755 --> 55:06.880
- You're much stronger than you look, Vik!
- That's right!

55:07.880 --> 55:10.630
- You ready for this?
- I don't know if I am!

55:10.713 --> 55:12.630
Oh, Grace!

55:13.005 --> 55:16.213
- Grace! Oh, Grace!
- Huh? Why do you keep saying Grace?

55:16.296 --> 55:18.338
Darling, it's the only thing
that gets me in the mood.

55:18.421 --> 55:22.046
Grace!
You look so good for your age!

55:22.130 --> 55:25.588
- <i>So </i> good for your age! Oh, God!
- Your skin is beautiful!

55:25.671 --> 55:28.796
- You have no wrinkles...
- No wrinkles any--

55:28.880 --> 55:29.755
Anywhere!

55:29.838 --> 55:32.630
Oh, my God! Grace, you're so--

55:32.713 --> 55:33.796
Oh, God!

55:36.588 --> 55:37.880
- Uh-oh.
- Vik.

55:37.963 --> 55:39.005
Mm-hmm?

55:39.088 --> 55:40.171
What happened?

55:41.255 --> 55:43.838
Maybe we should,
like, conversate a little bit.

55:43.921 --> 55:45.546
Get to know each other. Know what I mean?

55:45.630 --> 55:48.921
Like, eye to eye, really connect.
Tell me about your favorite band.

55:50.046 --> 55:53.505
I'm going to the casino.
Maybe I'll get lucky there.

55:53.588 --> 55:56.463
Look, look, look!
Please don't tell anybody about this

55:56.546 --> 55:58.713
'cause I've got some mad sex cred
in these parts, yeah.

55:58.796 --> 55:59.921
My people know me.

56:00.005 --> 56:01.296
I'll buy you a hat!

56:02.963 --> 56:05.088
I can't believe this just happened.

56:05.171 --> 56:06.546
Okay, okay.

56:08.046 --> 56:09.588
All right. We gotta calm down.

56:09.671 --> 56:11.796
- This has been a really weird day, huh?
- Yeah.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.671
Okay. Let's just get out of this place.

56:13.755 --> 56:17.296
Absolutely.
Someplace with beer though, please.

56:17.380 --> 56:18.796
"I'll go buy you a hat."

56:21.713 --> 56:24.588
Sergei was trying to tell us
the Colonel did it,

56:24.671 --> 56:27.713
but then he gets shot.
There's no way the Colonel shot him

56:27.796 --> 56:29.463
'cause the Colonel was having
a floss party.

56:29.546 --> 56:31.838
Did you see how crazy he was going
with the teeth flossing?

56:31.921 --> 56:34.255
- I did.
- What did he have in there? A buffet?

56:38.463 --> 56:40.171
- Um...
- Oh, my gosh.

56:45.213 --> 56:46.963
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

56:47.046 --> 56:49.171
Well, you took French in high school,
didn't you?

56:49.255 --> 56:52.380
I don't remember high school!
What did you take in high school?

56:52.463 --> 56:54.588
- Latin.
- Oh, great. Who takes freakin' Latin?

56:54.671 --> 56:56.380
- People who have a hot Latin teacher.
- Shh!

56:58.796 --> 57:00.963
Okay, so something, something...

57:01.046 --> 57:03.296
Something cake. Something's frosted.

57:03.380 --> 57:04.671
Okay. You're fired. You're fired.

57:04.755 --> 57:06.338
- Okay, I told you--
- Excuse me, sir.

57:06.421 --> 57:09.255
Could you translate that for us, please?
<i>S'il vous plaît?</i>

57:09.671 --> 57:11.713
Uh, the TV says that, uh...

57:12.380 --> 57:14.630
you are the most wanted... for...

57:15.713 --> 57:16.713
for <i>meurtre.</i>

57:16.796 --> 57:18.505
- No, no, no.
- Okay, no, no. We...

57:18.588 --> 57:20.505
This is a complete misunderstanding, okay?

57:20.588 --> 57:22.005
We were just around...

57:22.088 --> 57:24.213
- We saw--
- ...a lot of people that happened to die,

57:24.296 --> 57:25.421
but we didn't <i>murt.</i>

57:25.505 --> 57:28.296
You are to be arrested at first sight.

57:28.380 --> 57:29.880
- Us?
- So, here's what we do.

57:29.963 --> 57:32.505
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

57:32.588 --> 57:34.505
They can't track our SIM card now.

57:34.588 --> 57:36.505
Yeah, then pull the SIM card out.

57:36.588 --> 57:39.005
You don't just submerge our phones
into a bucket of beer.

57:39.088 --> 57:42.713
Now-- Now he's saying
that madame is hairdresser,

57:42.796 --> 57:44.963
you are, uh... police officer?

57:45.421 --> 57:46.921
No, he's-- he's a detective.

57:47.213 --> 57:48.338
Ah. No, he's not.

57:48.421 --> 57:49.796
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

57:49.880 --> 57:52.338
No, no, no.
He says that you have, uh, confessed

57:52.421 --> 57:54.213
to lying about that you are detective.

57:54.505 --> 57:56.296
What? No. Now he's making stuff up.

57:56.380 --> 57:59.130
TV says you have failed
your detective exam many, many times.

57:59.213 --> 58:01.630
All right! Enough <i>translato.</i> That's not--

58:01.713 --> 58:03.921
You're just improvising, pal,
and it's getting weird.

58:04.005 --> 58:05.296
What-- What is he talking about?

58:05.380 --> 58:07.296
<i>I will repeat this message</i>
<i>in English.</i>

58:07.796 --> 58:08.963
<i>Nick Spitz...</i>

58:09.380 --> 58:10.671
<i>is many things,</i>

58:10.755 --> 58:12.046
<i>but not a detective.</i>

58:14.463 --> 58:15.588
Well, I heard that.

58:15.671 --> 58:17.713
<i>I will repeat this message</i>
<i>in Spanish.</i>

58:17.796 --> 58:18.921
Did you lie to me?

58:19.963 --> 58:21.505
I didn't-- I didn't lie.

58:21.588 --> 58:23.546
- The guy-- The guy was--
- Oh, God. No, no, no.

58:24.338 --> 58:26.046
Whoa. Hey.

58:26.130 --> 58:28.046
- No.
- Hun, hun, hun.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.880
This whole thing's just--
just very complicated.

58:30.963 --> 58:33.921
Complicated, yeah.
I thought people were simple.

58:34.005 --> 58:36.046
Audrey, please.

58:36.130 --> 58:38.880
What? Did you lie
about getting that raise, too?

58:40.921 --> 58:43.130
How are we affording this trip?

58:44.213 --> 58:47.380
You made me feel like
I had to take you on this honeymoon.

58:47.463 --> 58:50.755
You told me
you already booked this honeymoon.

58:51.171 --> 58:53.380
You gave this to me.
This was my anniversary gift.

58:53.463 --> 58:55.088
- Okay.
- You lied about that, too?

58:55.171 --> 58:56.630
We'll get into all that, okay?

58:56.713 --> 59:00.213
But right now, I gotta figure out
how we're gonna get out of this situation.

59:00.296 --> 59:03.130
You have to figure this out?
What do you think I've been doing?

59:03.213 --> 59:05.005
This is what I do for a living,
sweetheart!

59:05.088 --> 59:06.796
You're a goddamn hairdresser!

59:09.171 --> 59:10.255
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa.

59:12.921 --> 59:15.088
- Where you going?
- I need a minute.

59:15.171 --> 59:17.171
We don't have a minute!

59:17.255 --> 59:19.421
Just leave me alone. Don't you follow me.

59:39.755 --> 59:41.880
You need to get out
of Monte Carlo right away.

59:42.546 --> 59:44.755
I got you into this,
I'll help get you out. Come with me.

59:45.380 --> 59:47.255
- Now! We have to go.
- Right.

59:49.546 --> 59:51.546
- Lake Como, back roads.
- Yes, sir.

59:55.338 --> 59:57.463
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know. I don't care.

01:00:25.963 --> 01:00:27.588
<i>Jimmy boy, it's Nick.</i>

01:00:27.671 --> 01:00:29.255
Where are you?

01:00:29.338 --> 01:00:31.130
You guys are all over the news.

01:00:31.213 --> 01:00:32.630
They say you killed three people.

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:33.921
Do you think that's possible?

01:00:34.671 --> 01:00:36.296
With your aim? Hell, no.

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.380
Exactly. Now I'm gonna text you
two international numbers.

01:00:39.463 --> 01:00:41.838
Can you link them together
so I can follow one from the other?

01:00:42.255 --> 01:00:44.046
Are you trying to get my ass fired?

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.046
But hell, yeah.

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:46.963
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:47.046 --> 01:00:49.796
There's one more thing
I want you to check into for me.

01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:55.630
What are we doing?

01:00:55.713 --> 01:00:58.255
I just have to dash in
for a quick appointment with my lawyer.

01:00:58.671 --> 01:01:00.838
We're going to read Malcolm's will
at the villa later on,

01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:02.755
and I'm going to get what's mine.

01:01:02.838 --> 01:01:06.005
Charles, that just sounded
very suspicious.

01:01:06.421 --> 01:01:07.921
What about this week doesn't?

01:01:15.296 --> 01:01:16.338
Oh, God.

01:01:21.046 --> 01:01:22.505
Oh, my God. Claritin.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.505
This is Japanese Claritin.

01:02:16.588 --> 01:02:17.546
Hello?

01:02:19.838 --> 01:02:20.838
Charles?

01:02:27.088 --> 01:02:27.921
Audrey!

01:02:28.921 --> 01:02:30.005
- Ow!
- God!

01:02:30.088 --> 01:02:31.046
- Ow!
- What the--

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.963
What the--

01:02:32.713 --> 01:02:34.338
What are you doing here?

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:37.088
I followed Suzi here.

01:02:37.171 --> 01:02:38.588
- Suzi's here?
- Yes.

01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:42.421
Okay, Cavendish came here to find Suzi.
I'm telling you, Cavendish is in on this.

01:02:42.505 --> 01:02:43.630
I know. I knew that!

01:02:43.713 --> 01:02:46.630
Okay. I just found
a box of Japanese Claritin

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:49.046
in the back of Cavendish's limo.

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.171
So what? They were planning this
the whole damn time?

01:02:51.255 --> 01:02:53.088
The whole time. This was their plan.

01:02:53.171 --> 01:02:55.171
- So they kill Malcolm, they kill Tobey...
- Yeah.

01:02:55.255 --> 01:02:57.338
...before Malcolm has time
to sign the new will.

01:02:57.421 --> 01:02:59.546
- Right.
- That way, Cavendish inherits everything.

01:02:59.838 --> 01:03:01.130
And he splits it with Suzi.

01:03:01.213 --> 01:03:03.713
And if they killed him after,
then Suzi would have inherited.

01:03:03.796 --> 01:03:05.880
- They still would have split that.
- It was a win-win.

01:03:05.963 --> 01:03:06.838
Oh, look at that.

01:03:07.505 --> 01:03:08.921
Who figured that whole thing out?

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:11.296
The hairdresser. Mm-mm. The hairdresser.

01:03:16.171 --> 01:03:17.421
I got you!

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:18.421
Jesus! Oh, my God.

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:20.296
It's just like <i>Death at the Library!</i>

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.255
What happens in <i>Death at the Library?</i>

01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:25.130
They died. That's why it's called
<i>Death at the Library.</i>

01:03:29.463 --> 01:03:31.130
Nick, what are you doing?

01:03:31.630 --> 01:03:33.671
We are going to push this over
on the count of three,

01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:35.505
- and then we're gonna run.
- We're gonna what?

01:03:35.755 --> 01:03:37.588
- Don't you trust me?
- No!

01:03:38.255 --> 01:03:39.880
Ready? One!

01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.630
Two!

01:03:43.338 --> 01:03:44.588
Three!

01:03:56.255 --> 01:03:57.505
Oh, look! There!

01:04:03.588 --> 01:04:06.088
Oh! Sorry! Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.

01:04:06.171 --> 01:04:07.171
Come on.

01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:11.838
- Is that--
- Is that Juan Carlos?

01:04:12.088 --> 01:04:14.005
- Juan Carlos!
- Hey!

01:04:14.296 --> 01:04:15.171
Hello!

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:16.421
- Juan Carlos!
- How am I?

01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:18.505
- No, no. Suzi! Suzi!
- Suzi! Suzi! Which way is Suzi?

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.963
- Married to Malcolm.
- You two married! Good!

01:04:21.046 --> 01:04:22.046
- No!
- No!

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:25.963
<i>Suzi vidisti?
Putamus esse illa interfectorem.</i>

01:04:26.421 --> 01:04:28.255
- Yes!
- Latin, baby!

01:04:28.338 --> 01:04:30.046
- Still the international language!
- I got it!

01:04:32.255 --> 01:04:33.296
Shit.

01:04:35.046 --> 01:04:36.255
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:04:41.963 --> 01:04:42.921
Where'd she go?

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:44.630
She was right there.

01:04:45.213 --> 01:04:47.755
You should have never come to Lake Como.

01:04:48.046 --> 01:04:50.130
- Wait a minute.
- We know about you and Cavendish.

01:04:50.213 --> 01:04:52.713
- You know nothing.
- We know you're still in love,

01:04:52.796 --> 01:04:54.880
and we know that love is tough
without money.

01:04:54.963 --> 01:04:55.838
Isn't it, Suzi?

01:04:56.088 --> 01:04:58.380
I'll take your word for it.
You're the one whose shoes

01:04:58.463 --> 01:05:00.046
still got a sticker from Marshalls on it.

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:02.171
- They have name brands now!
- How dare you?

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:03.838
- They have name brands now!
- How dare you?

01:05:03.921 --> 01:05:05.713
- What?
- These are from Target.

01:05:05.796 --> 01:05:08.130
- How could you not tell me?
- I don't look at your--

01:05:08.213 --> 01:05:09.671
Shut up!

01:05:09.755 --> 01:05:12.255
- Oh!
- Suzi, don't. Please, don't do this.

01:05:12.338 --> 01:05:14.880
No matter what you do,
you're not gonna be safe. I'm telling you.

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:17.255
One murderer always double-crosses
the other murderer.

01:05:17.338 --> 01:05:19.880
- She reads the books.
- It's just a cliché of the genre!

01:05:19.963 --> 01:05:21.296
I'm telling you!

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.463
Hey! Halloween!

01:05:27.171 --> 01:05:28.671
No, no, no! Oh, my God!

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:29.588
Go, go, go!

01:05:30.005 --> 01:05:32.130
Cavendish, you move,
I'll blow your head off!

01:05:35.296 --> 01:05:36.463
Shoot <i>at </i> him!

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:42.463
Oh, babe, you're the worst shot!

01:05:42.713 --> 01:05:45.088
Those were warning shots, honey!

01:05:45.171 --> 01:05:47.296
- Oh, yes! I go fast!
- Go!

01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:50.880
Ambulance! <i>Emergencia!</i>

01:05:53.921 --> 01:05:54.755
Oh!

01:06:00.213 --> 01:06:02.380
Okay, Suzi.
You've gotta tell me who did this.

01:06:02.463 --> 01:06:03.921
Slow down. Don't use your words.

01:06:04.005 --> 01:06:06.130
Let's charade it, okay.
Just tell me with your hand.

01:06:06.588 --> 01:06:08.463
Uh, claw. Bear claw.

01:06:08.546 --> 01:06:09.880
No. Grizzly bear claw.

01:06:09.963 --> 01:06:11.671
Oh! Chewy. Chewy.

01:06:11.755 --> 01:06:13.463
So it's Sergei? No, Sergei's dead.

01:06:13.963 --> 01:06:15.046
Hey!

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:19.046
Have you got tires on your feet? Good God!

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.838
Spooning. Eating. Uh...

01:06:21.921 --> 01:06:23.838
Ice cream. No, no. Gelato. Gelato?

01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:26.880
Oh, God. It's amazing how pretty
you are when you're-- I'm sorry.

01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:27.963
Hey.

01:06:28.046 --> 01:06:29.505
Hey! Come on!

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.255
Oh, shoot!

01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:46.380
Hey!

01:06:49.838 --> 01:06:51.505
Ba-ba-ba-ba!

01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:54.005
Crazy... crazy... Crazy mad love!

01:06:54.255 --> 01:06:56.463
It's crazy 'cause you're madly in love
with Cavendish.

01:06:57.005 --> 01:06:59.005
It's Cavendish, no?
<i>Sleeping With the Ene--</i>

01:06:59.088 --> 01:07:00.130
Sleeping.

01:07:00.213 --> 01:07:01.338
You're not sleeping.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:04.213
- She's dead now?
- I don't know why this keeps happening!

01:07:04.296 --> 01:07:06.088
<i>Let's go!</i>
<i>We gotta get out of here.</i>

01:07:06.171 --> 01:07:07.880
- <i>Oh, my God. Come on.</i>
<i>- </i><i>Where?</i>

01:07:08.838 --> 01:07:11.171
Close the airports! Search house to house!

01:07:11.255 --> 01:07:14.088
As God as my witness,
I will find Nick and Audrey Spitz.

01:07:14.838 --> 01:07:16.005
- Inspector?
- Yes?

01:07:16.088 --> 01:07:18.421
I have Nick and Audrey Spitz
on the phone for you.

01:07:18.505 --> 01:07:20.296
- Huh?
- Nick and Audrey Spitz.

01:07:22.546 --> 01:07:23.380
Where are you?

01:07:23.713 --> 01:07:26.338
We are on our way
to Quince's villa right now.

01:07:27.046 --> 01:07:29.213
Oh, okay.

01:07:29.296 --> 01:07:32.046
I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared
for you to actually answer that.

01:07:32.463 --> 01:07:33.880
We are being framed right now.

01:07:33.963 --> 01:07:36.921
You meet us at the villa,
we will reveal the killer.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:38.880
That kinda rhymed.

01:07:39.838 --> 01:07:41.005
Which is cool, I think.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.671
- Look at this place.
- Let's go.

01:07:53.755 --> 01:07:55.630
- Oh, my God.
- This is big.

01:07:55.713 --> 01:07:59.463
This is a big house.
This is what they call rich people shit.

01:07:59.546 --> 01:08:01.588
<i>Lord Cavendish is expecting us.</i>

01:08:01.921 --> 01:08:03.671
Second floor, eighth door on the left.

01:08:03.755 --> 01:08:05.588
Yes, that's right.
That's what he told us, yeah.

01:08:05.671 --> 01:08:08.755
Okay, so take a five-spotter.

01:08:08.838 --> 01:08:11.588
Your five euros is how much American-wise?

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.005
Six American dollars.

01:08:13.088 --> 01:08:15.296
Oh, that's, uh... that's more than I--

01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:18.087
- Can I get a half a euro back--
- Oh, God. Please, Nick. Thank you.

01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:20.130
I didn't know they were ahead of us
with the money.

01:08:20.921 --> 01:08:23.046
- Second floor...
- I got no bullets left,

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:25.796
so we'll bluff 'em
until Interpol gets here.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.505
Honey, you just gotta be careful.

01:08:27.587 --> 01:08:30.546
This guy has killed four people,
that we know of.

01:08:30.837 --> 01:08:32.921
Good news is, we know who did it.

01:08:33.005 --> 01:08:34.671
- Okay.
- Hard part is over with.

01:08:34.755 --> 01:08:35.630
Okay.

01:08:35.712 --> 01:08:36.712
And...

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:38.255
What's up, Dish?

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:41.005
Stay still!
I'll shoot you right in the six-pack!

01:08:41.087 --> 01:08:42.755
- You hear me, bitch?
- Calm down, babe.

01:08:43.046 --> 01:08:45.837
Make a move! I dare you!

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:46.837
I dare--

01:08:46.921 --> 01:08:47.796
Oh, my God!

01:08:48.087 --> 01:08:49.505
- He's dead.
- He's dead.

01:08:49.837 --> 01:08:51.171
- Okay, he's dead.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:51.255 --> 01:08:53.755
- What the hell?
- Oh, God. Case reopened, babe.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.505
They must have poisoned his drink!

01:08:55.587 --> 01:08:57.671
- Nick!
- And look at his face. It's--

01:08:57.755 --> 01:09:01.130
I mean, besides the foaming mouth,
he still kinda looks good.

01:09:01.212 --> 01:09:02.296
What is with this man?

01:09:03.671 --> 01:09:06.212
We told the police. We called the police.
We told 'em to come here.

01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:07.671
- Yes.
- We've got to stop them.

01:09:08.046 --> 01:09:11.462
It's not like canceling a pizza, honey.
You tell 'em to show up, they show up.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:13.462
If he's not the killer, who is the killer?

01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:16.796
And if we don't know who the killer is
before they get here, we're screwed!

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:17.962
Do you understand this?

01:09:18.046 --> 01:09:19.880
He's gotta be here in this house.

01:09:19.962 --> 01:09:23.462
This is gorgeous wallpaper.
Is that fabric? Is this embossed?

01:09:23.546 --> 01:09:26.880
Sweetheart, you're losing it!
You're making me nuts right now!

01:09:26.962 --> 01:09:28.171
No, I know. Hold on. Okay.

01:09:28.255 --> 01:09:29.880
All right, it's good.

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.087
You all right? You breathing?

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:33.130
- I have to breathe through this.
- Look at me.

01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:35.962
- We gotta turn ourselves in.
- Wait, what?

01:09:36.046 --> 01:09:38.505
They're all gonna show up.
If we run, they're gonna shoot us.

01:09:38.587 --> 01:09:40.462
What do you mean?
We're gonna just go to jail?

01:09:40.546 --> 01:09:42.421
It's better than getting shot, ain't it?

01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:45.171
I don't feel-- I don't feel good.

01:09:45.255 --> 01:09:46.587
- Babe.
- Oh, God.

01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:47.962
It's an Italian prison.

01:09:48.046 --> 01:09:49.755
You know the food's gonna be incredible.

01:09:49.837 --> 01:09:52.296
We'll have meatballs
and pesto sauce and all that.

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.212
It's not co-ed, honey. All right?

01:09:54.296 --> 01:09:56.255
We're-- We're not gonna be
in jail together.

01:09:56.338 --> 01:09:57.338
I know.

01:09:57.671 --> 01:09:58.880
Why did you lie to me?

01:10:02.213 --> 01:10:03.213
'Cause I was...

01:10:03.713 --> 01:10:05.755
I was, uh... I was embarrassed.

01:10:06.046 --> 01:10:07.088
With me?

01:10:07.796 --> 01:10:09.255
Why? I--

01:10:09.755 --> 01:10:12.630
I could've helped you figure that out.
That's why we're together.

01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:13.546
I know.

01:10:13.838 --> 01:10:16.380
Remember when I couldn't pay
my rent at the salon,

01:10:16.463 --> 01:10:20.713
and then you were like, "Oh, okay."
You got that boot off my landlord's car.

01:10:21.005 --> 01:10:23.130
- That got me another week.
- Yeah, I remember.

01:10:23.213 --> 01:10:25.213
Remember when your cholesterol
was through the roof?

01:10:25.505 --> 01:10:28.213
And then I made you eat egg whites?
You hate egg whites.

01:10:28.296 --> 01:10:30.088
And I made you do it,
and I did it with you.

01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:32.755
You helped me not miss yolks anymore.

01:10:32.838 --> 01:10:34.921
That's right. That's what we do.
We do things together.

01:10:35.005 --> 01:10:38.380
So can we please
just figure this out, too?

01:10:38.463 --> 01:10:40.255
We just don't know who did it.

01:10:40.338 --> 01:10:42.546
But Nick, we know who didn't do it.

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:43.921
- All right?
- Right.

01:10:44.005 --> 01:10:48.046
So let's just go downstairs
and act like we figured it out.

01:10:48.546 --> 01:10:51.463
If we're gonna do that, we gotta--
we just gotta look confident.

01:10:51.546 --> 01:10:54.380
All right. If we're gonna look confident,
we've gotta dress it.

01:10:54.463 --> 01:10:56.296
I already know what I wanna wear.

01:10:56.671 --> 01:10:57.505
What?

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.630
What's up, fools?

01:11:12.713 --> 01:11:15.005
Okay, we solved the case. Boom.

01:11:15.088 --> 01:11:18.213
Yo, yo! Where'd you get the clothes?
It's a little much.

01:11:18.713 --> 01:11:19.588
Um...

01:11:19.671 --> 01:11:22.796
I found this beautiful dress
in a random closet.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.255
- You're looking gorgeous, by the way.
- Thanks, baby.

01:11:25.338 --> 01:11:27.963
- And he got this stunning tux...
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:28.338 --> 01:11:29.171
...off a...

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:31.255
Oh, why candy-coat it?

01:11:31.338 --> 01:11:32.463
- A corpse.
- Yeah.

01:11:32.546 --> 01:11:33.838
There's another corpse?

01:11:33.921 --> 01:11:35.296
Jeez! Sorry, yes.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.046
Upstairs, eighth door on the left.

01:11:38.046 --> 01:11:40.505
To whom does this dead corpse belong?

01:11:40.588 --> 01:11:41.921
Oh, yeah. You guys don't know.

01:11:42.005 --> 01:11:43.213
- Bad news, guys.
- It's terrible.

01:11:43.296 --> 01:11:44.213
Cavendish is dead.

01:11:45.630 --> 01:11:48.213
You stole the tux off Charlie's dead body?

01:11:48.296 --> 01:11:50.755
And it fits perfectly.
Little tight in the crotch, to be honest.

01:11:50.838 --> 01:11:52.838
Just kidding. No, he's got me beat.
He's got me beat.

01:11:52.921 --> 01:11:54.588
Wait. Where's Suzi?

01:11:54.963 --> 01:11:56.338
- She's dead.
- Dead.

01:11:56.421 --> 01:11:57.421
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

01:11:57.505 --> 01:12:00.213
Y'all are like the miniature
Manson Family!

01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:01.713
- No, no, no.
- Nick and Audrey Spitz,

01:12:01.796 --> 01:12:03.463
- you are under arrest.
- Listen.

01:12:03.546 --> 01:12:05.171
<i>Ferme la bouche.</i> Is that what it is?

01:12:05.255 --> 01:12:07.921
- Just give us a second. We got this.
- We got this. Let's go.

01:12:08.005 --> 01:12:08.880
Thank you.

01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:13.880
All right. Ladies and gentlemen,
let's review the facts.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:14.838
Malcolm Quince,

01:12:14.921 --> 01:12:16.796
he was the first to get murdered.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.505
We all assumed it was Tobey.

01:12:18.588 --> 01:12:20.796
- No, we all assumed you did it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.505
- Okay.
- Yeah, but Tobey hated his father,

01:12:23.588 --> 01:12:26.546
and he stood to inherit
billions of dollars.

01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:29.171
- Until he caught some lead to the dome.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:29.255 --> 01:12:31.380
- Can you feel me, Raja?
- Pew-pew-pew!

01:12:31.671 --> 01:12:32.796
- There it is.
- And then,

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:36.005
before Sergei was shot,
he told us that the Colonel did it.

01:12:36.088 --> 01:12:37.088
He told you what?

01:12:37.171 --> 01:12:40.421
But we know you didn't do it, Colonel,
because we saw you flossing your teeth

01:12:40.505 --> 01:12:42.463
when we were shimmying
by your window that night.

01:12:42.755 --> 01:12:45.505
You two were spying on me in my bathroom?

01:12:45.588 --> 01:12:49.255
Trust me, I did-- We saw a lot of shit
that night that I did not want to see.

01:12:49.338 --> 01:12:52.921
I mean, apologize ahead of time.
We had to see you guys having sex.

01:12:53.213 --> 01:12:54.296
You, um...

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.130
You... saw that?

01:12:56.213 --> 01:12:57.880
Maharajah, some advice for you.

01:12:57.963 --> 01:12:59.963
Maybe grab the bottom and squeeze.

01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:02.546
Huh. Word.

01:13:03.088 --> 01:13:03.921
Anyway...

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:05.213
French fries. Yes.

01:13:05.296 --> 01:13:07.713
Actually, Juan Carlos,
you had nothing to do with this.

01:13:07.796 --> 01:13:09.505
You couldn't have had anything
to do with it

01:13:09.588 --> 01:13:12.255
because you were with us
when Suzi got killed.

01:13:12.338 --> 01:13:14.046
- So it wasn't you.
- Mm-mm.

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:15.505
- It wasn't you.
- Mm-mm.

01:13:15.588 --> 01:13:17.338
- It wasn't you.
- No.

01:13:17.421 --> 01:13:18.546
It wasn't you.

01:13:18.921 --> 01:13:20.463
Holy shit! Maybe we did do it.

01:13:20.546 --> 01:13:22.005
- What?
- Did you?

01:13:22.088 --> 01:13:24.046
- Because listen--
- What did you just say to me?

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:26.380
- I'm just messing around.
- There it is.

01:13:26.463 --> 01:13:28.421
- And he's clapping.
- Going to jail. Thanks, babe.

01:13:28.505 --> 01:13:31.463
I'm glad we finally
are all on the same page.

01:13:31.755 --> 01:13:35.338
Now, since the first murder occurred
in French territorial waters,

01:13:35.421 --> 01:13:38.838
I will be taking you to Paris
to be arraigned and tried.

01:13:38.921 --> 01:13:41.005
At least we're going to Paris.
You always wanted to go.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:43.921
Honey, if you keep making jokes
at a time like this,

01:13:44.005 --> 01:13:45.505
it's not gonna make this go away.

01:13:45.588 --> 01:13:48.838
Lucky for you, since 1977,

01:13:48.921 --> 01:13:51.630
there has been no death penalty
under French law.

01:13:52.005 --> 01:13:53.421
French law.

01:13:53.505 --> 01:13:54.421
French law.

01:13:54.505 --> 01:13:56.005
The French law. Yeah.

01:13:56.088 --> 01:13:58.671
Surely, Inspector, you of all people

01:13:58.755 --> 01:14:01.546
are familiar
with the French inheritance law.

01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:03.880
Are you implying I have bastard children?

01:14:04.505 --> 01:14:05.421
Well, I wasn't.

01:14:05.505 --> 01:14:06.588
Because I do.

01:14:06.671 --> 01:14:08.505
I was surprised you knew about them.

01:14:08.796 --> 01:14:10.421
I love those little bastards.

01:14:10.755 --> 01:14:14.880
Okay. Anyway, um,
the French law states that a man's estate

01:14:14.963 --> 01:14:17.880
must be divided equally
amongst his children.

01:14:18.171 --> 01:14:20.505
So it wouldn't matter what the will said.

01:14:20.588 --> 01:14:22.213
Straight up, Maharajah.

01:14:22.296 --> 01:14:26.380
The kids were gonna get the money,
whether the old man married Suzi or not.

01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:29.421
Mm-hmm.
But both of Malcolm's children are dead.

01:14:29.713 --> 01:14:31.255
- Both?
- Yes. Tobey,

01:14:31.338 --> 01:14:34.463
and the son he had
with Madeleine LeBoutillier..

01:14:34.546 --> 01:14:36.463
That boy died at childbirth.

01:14:36.755 --> 01:14:37.671
Did he, Colonel?

01:14:38.171 --> 01:14:40.171
I spoke to my partner in New York City.

01:14:40.255 --> 01:14:43.713
I said, get the death certificates
for Madeleine and the son.

01:14:43.796 --> 01:14:45.630
He could only find one for Madeleine.

01:14:45.713 --> 01:14:48.130
But then I started thinking,
maybe there's no death certificate

01:14:48.213 --> 01:14:49.796
because there was no death.

01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.546
Nonsense. Malcolm desperately wanted a boy
to sire the next generation of Quinces.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:56.255
He would never abandon a son.

01:14:56.338 --> 01:14:57.296
But...

01:14:58.171 --> 01:14:59.213
what if it was a daughter?

01:14:59.296 --> 01:15:00.463
- Yes!
- What if it was a daughter?

01:15:00.546 --> 01:15:01.921
The love of his life dies,

01:15:02.005 --> 01:15:04.588
dies giving birth
to his unwanted daughter.

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.255
- Yes!
- It almost makes sense.

01:15:07.338 --> 01:15:09.546
- It does! It kinda does!
- It makes total sense.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:11.213
He gave her away.

01:15:11.296 --> 01:15:12.421
Then where is she now?

01:15:12.505 --> 01:15:15.171
Well, she could be anywhere.
She could have got married.

01:15:15.255 --> 01:15:18.046
She could've joined a gang,
changed her name. Who knows? Carry on.

01:15:18.338 --> 01:15:19.880
- Changed her name.
- Ah!

01:15:19.963 --> 01:15:22.505
- You changed your name.
- Yes.

01:15:22.588 --> 01:15:24.296
Your real last name isn't Ballard.

01:15:24.588 --> 01:15:25.421
So?

01:15:25.796 --> 01:15:27.796
Lots of artists change their names.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.796
Lady Gaga's real name isn't Lady Gaga.

01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:32.088
Yes, Lady Gaga. "Paparazzi," yes, good.

01:15:32.171 --> 01:15:35.546
But every Grace Ballard superfan knows

01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:37.755
your first movie was <i>Summer Wetdown.</i>

01:15:37.838 --> 01:15:41.088
You had three lines,
and you went by your birth name,

01:15:41.171 --> 01:15:42.671
Grace Butler.

01:15:43.046 --> 01:15:46.005
Which, <i>en français,</i>
roughly translates to LeBoutillier.

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:48.588
Madeleine LeBoutillier, your mother.

01:15:48.671 --> 01:15:49.588
This is a joke.

01:15:49.671 --> 01:15:52.005
I wasn't even in the room
when Malcolm Quince was murdered.

01:15:52.088 --> 01:15:55.171
Fine! Then Tobey killed him,
but he did it with a little help.

01:15:55.255 --> 01:15:57.380
<i>The lights. You turned out the lights.</i>

01:15:58.088 --> 01:16:01.463
<i>You convinced Tobey to kill Malcolm</i>
<i>so you could split the money with him.</i>

01:16:03.588 --> 01:16:06.588
<i>And then you killed Tobey</i>
<i>so that you could just keep all of it.</i>

01:16:06.671 --> 01:16:09.505
Then me and this girl
started asking too many questions.

01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:10.921
So you had to get rid of us.

01:16:14.588 --> 01:16:17.338
<i>Luckily, not for him,</i>
<i>but Sergei gets in the way.</i>

01:16:18.463 --> 01:16:20.213
<i>Then you seduce the Maharajah</i>

01:16:20.296 --> 01:16:23.088
<i>so that you would make us think
you were with him all night.</i>

01:16:23.171 --> 01:16:26.505
Yo, you were just twizzlin'
on my wizzle for an alibi.

01:16:26.588 --> 01:16:27.671
Girl, that's cold.

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:29.880
You tried to kill us in the library.

01:16:30.463 --> 01:16:33.213
<i>You tried to kill us in the market,</i>
<i>but you got Suzi instead.</i>

01:16:34.755 --> 01:16:36.213
- And the weapon...
- Hm!

01:16:36.296 --> 01:16:38.463
- I recognize the weapon now.
- The dart?

01:16:38.546 --> 01:16:41.255
It was a movie. I watched it one night.
You were out with your friends.

01:16:41.338 --> 01:16:43.046
You came back drunk and, uh...

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:44.296
What the hell was it?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:46.005
<i>Princess Blow Dart.</i>

01:16:46.088 --> 01:16:47.046
Oh, God.

01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:48.505
That is not the name of a movie.

01:16:48.588 --> 01:16:49.630
It is! It is!

01:16:49.713 --> 01:16:51.380
Yo, look at my screensaver.

01:16:51.671 --> 01:16:53.421
- That's her!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:16:53.505 --> 01:16:55.588
So then you killed Charles

01:16:55.671 --> 01:16:59.505
<i>because you knew he would never rest
until he found out who Suzi's killer was.</i>

01:17:00.088 --> 01:17:02.421
<i>'Cause he loved Suzi, not you!</i>

01:17:02.505 --> 01:17:03.796
<i>The three motives:</i>

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.421
money, love, revenge.

01:17:05.505 --> 01:17:06.755
You were the mastermind

01:17:06.838 --> 01:17:09.046
behind Malcolm Quince's murders,
weren't you?

01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:12.171
- And you were the one who framed us.
- You killed them all, didn't you?

01:17:12.255 --> 01:17:13.296
Didn't you?

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.588
My father was a monster.

01:17:17.755 --> 01:17:18.755
So you admit it?

01:17:19.171 --> 01:17:20.046
Yes.

01:17:20.755 --> 01:17:23.755
I am the daughter of Malcolm Quince
and Madeleine LeBoutillier,

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.421
and sole heir to the Quince fortune.

01:17:27.671 --> 01:17:30.130
Uh, and... what about the murders?

01:17:31.505 --> 01:17:33.046
Oh, I didn't do those.

01:17:33.505 --> 01:17:36.338
But it couldn't have happened
to a nicer group of people.

01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:38.505
So...

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:40.463
what other proof do you have?

01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:42.171
- Of what?
- Proof of what?

01:17:42.255 --> 01:17:43.796
That she killed everybody?

01:17:44.255 --> 01:17:45.088
Yes.

01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:46.880
Aren't you gonna do anything at all?

01:17:47.338 --> 01:17:49.421
I mean, is there a French holiday
we're unaware of?

01:17:49.505 --> 01:17:50.755
What the hell do you do?

01:17:50.963 --> 01:17:51.796
Look...

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:54.796
I don't know
how you do things in Brooklyn,

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:57.463
but here we need evidence
to make an arrest.

01:17:57.546 --> 01:17:59.255
This is not
how this is supposed to happen.

01:17:59.338 --> 01:18:03.005
The detective is supposed to explain
the murders, which we just did,

01:18:03.088 --> 01:18:07.880
and then the killer is supposed to crack
and freak out under pressure and admit it!

01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:09.588
If there's nothing else,

01:18:09.671 --> 01:18:11.880
I'd like to start spending my money now.

01:18:16.796 --> 01:18:19.171
The hat. The hat! Uh, take off your hat.

01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:21.588
What?

01:18:22.171 --> 01:18:24.005
I said take off your hat.

01:18:25.755 --> 01:18:26.630
No.

01:18:27.046 --> 01:18:29.921
The Maharajah bought me this hat,
and I quite like it.

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:32.421
Nick hit the killer in the head
with a plate.

01:18:33.171 --> 01:18:35.046
And it left a mark, didn't it?

01:18:35.671 --> 01:18:36.546
Also,

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:41.213
why on earth would you put a hat
on a freshly styled head of hair?

01:18:41.296 --> 01:18:43.796
How would you know
my hair's been freshly styled?

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.255
'Cause she's a goddamn hairdresser.

01:18:47.296 --> 01:18:49.046
Please remove your hat, Ms. Butler.

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.255
I'll do nothing of the kind.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.296
The butler did it. Grace Butler did it!
Grace But-- Right?

01:18:58.380 --> 01:19:00.796
- I said it on the plane.
- You had to do it!

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.130
- Stay back!
- Jesus!

01:19:02.505 --> 01:19:03.505
Everybody!

01:19:06.255 --> 01:19:08.130
- Oh, my God!
- Son of a bitch.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.963
- Wait! No, no.
- Whoa!

01:19:10.046 --> 01:19:11.213
Nobody move!

01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:12.755
Nobody move, or I'll shoot her.

01:19:12.838 --> 01:19:14.421
Guns down. <i>Baissez vos armes.</i>

01:19:22.588 --> 01:19:23.713
Get an ambulance.

01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:26.380
Yo, I thought you said
he was a terrible shot.

01:19:26.463 --> 01:19:28.630
Not when it comes to saving my woman.

01:19:28.713 --> 01:19:31.421
I was aiming for her foot, by the way.

01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:33.630
All right. It's all right.

01:19:37.588 --> 01:19:40.296
Thank you for stepping in
and trying to stop her, Juan Carlos.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:41.546
That was so brave.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.921
<i>De nada, señora.</i>

01:19:45.963 --> 01:19:48.921
I love that. I love that he's brave
and I'm, what, nothing?

01:19:49.005 --> 01:19:51.755
- Are you kidding? I said you were brave.
<i>- </i> You didn't say it.

01:19:51.838 --> 01:19:54.380
I said so many times.
"Nick, you were so brave."

01:19:54.463 --> 01:19:57.005
<i>De nada, señora. </i> Halloween.

01:19:58.005 --> 01:19:59.088
Yo, I got a question.

01:19:59.755 --> 01:20:01.505
In the hotel in Monte Carlo,

01:20:01.588 --> 01:20:03.505
you said that you saw
me and Grace together.

01:20:03.796 --> 01:20:05.130
- We heard you.
- We heard you.

01:20:05.213 --> 01:20:07.088
We didn't like what we heard,
but I'll tell--

01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:09.380
- I'm sorry.
- I hope those are new pants, by the way.

01:20:09.463 --> 01:20:11.213
Yeah, but...

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:13.088
But the truth is,

01:20:13.171 --> 01:20:15.421
Grace and I were together in the bar

01:20:15.505 --> 01:20:17.505
an hour before we got to our room,

01:20:17.588 --> 01:20:20.046
so how could she have killed Sergei

01:20:20.588 --> 01:20:21.713
if she was with me?

01:20:24.338 --> 01:20:25.213
Nick.

my English just now?

01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:06.588
