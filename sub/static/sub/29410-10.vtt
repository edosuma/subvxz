00:03.742 --> 00:05.744
ANNOUNCER:
Tonight on
American Direct News...

00:05.788 --> 00:08.486
MARTIN:
What consoles me
is that as a doctor,

00:08.530 --> 00:11.402
I saved thousands of lives.

00:11.446 --> 00:15.145
So if we're judging
the moral worth of a person

00:15.189 --> 00:17.191
based on the mark
they leave on the world,

00:17.234 --> 00:20.455
mine is a... a net positive.

00:20.498 --> 00:24.285
Dr. Martin Whitly murdered
23 people as The Surgeon,

00:24.328 --> 00:27.288
making him one of the world's
most notorious serial killers.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.682
I'm Ainsley Whitly
forAmerican Direct News,

00:30.726 --> 00:33.816
and The Surgeon is my father.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.123
MARTIN:
I was, um,

00:36.166 --> 00:37.124
a mentor.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.474
I'm not a perfect man.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.910
It's true.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.868
Isn't that what counts?

00:42.912 --> 00:44.261
[echoing]:
That in the end,

00:44.305 --> 00:45.523
I did some good?

00:45.567 --> 00:46.872
AINSLEY:
What kind of a father

00:46.916 --> 00:48.004
-does that?
-Stop it!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.745
I was a good father, damn it!

00:49.788 --> 00:51.573
Say that again.
Say I was a terrible father!

00:51.616 --> 00:53.923
[glass shatters]

00:56.969 --> 01:00.147
-[sighs]
-Mother...

01:00.190 --> 01:01.844
-My TV.
-I thought we agreed

01:01.887 --> 01:03.672
to avoid watching this garbage.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.021
No, you agreed.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.631
I thought it best not to argue.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.590
Is this your plan?
To foil Ainsley's ratings

01:08.633 --> 01:11.245
by destroying every television
in America?

01:11.288 --> 01:14.030
-Ugh.
-God knows you have
enough shoes.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.032
I don't know why
you torture yourself.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.034
I thought you were newly devoted
to being "normal."

01:18.078 --> 01:22.169
Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.127
[exhales]

01:24.171 --> 01:27.348
Why didn't you tell me?
The girl in the box.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.351
The memories. You have proof.
They're all real.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.179
How did you...

01:34.398 --> 01:35.573
Gil.

01:35.617 --> 01:40.187
We told you they weren't real
for years.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.885
Of course you're not normal.
How could you be?

01:42.928 --> 01:45.148
It's not your fault. Or Gil's.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.890
Martin Whitly did this to me.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.197
He manipulated me,
he drugged me.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.068
-Drugged you?
-He used chloroform.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
To confuse me.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.333
To help me forget.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.470
I thought he loved you.

02:02.513 --> 02:08.215
That at least he took care
of you, and your sister.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.262
I'm sorry.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.831
Thank you.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.659
But you don't have to say that.

02:17.702 --> 02:20.357
I really do.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.449
And I have to clear the air
before tomorrow night.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.104
Christmas, dear.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.323
It's an annual holiday?

02:29.366 --> 02:31.107
Maybe you've noticed
the decorations

02:31.151 --> 02:34.110
and that handsy Santa
outside Gristedes?

02:34.893 --> 02:37.200
I'm not feeling very festive.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.597
Your father has taken
so much from us.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.556
Don't let him take this.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.777
[piano playing "We Wish You
a Merry Christmas"]

02:48.820 --> 02:51.083
[laughter]

02:53.825 --> 02:55.784
Sorry to call you in
on Christmas.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.613
It's okay. I was in
the neighborhood caroling.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.876
No sign of ESU or CSU?

03:00.919 --> 03:03.444
They're already upstairs.
We're keeping this quiet.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.880
Oh, yeah?

03:04.923 --> 03:08.710
Keeping secrets doesn't seem
to be your strong suit.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.581
My mother dropped by last night.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.280
She was gonna find out
soon enough.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.370
Better it came from one of us.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.067
Are there any updates
in the Paul Lazar case

03:18.110 --> 03:19.242
I need to know about?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
I don't have any answers.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.550
Neither does the FBI.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.943
Their task force is moving
into the precinct.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.294
-Oh, they'll want
to question me.
-They very much

03:27.337 --> 03:29.383
do not want to question you.

03:29.426 --> 03:32.037
The special agent in charge
is Colette...

03:32.081 --> 03:34.692
[sighs]
Swanson?

03:34.736 --> 03:37.565
We worked together in D.C.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.001
She hates me.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.264
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
Said to keep you out of her way.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.573
That all she said?

03:45.616 --> 03:49.185
There were other words,
but why ruin your holidays?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.448
Come on. I got something
that'll cheer you up.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.279
[sighs]

03:57.106 --> 03:59.064
Merry Christmas.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.370
Happy Hanukkah?

04:01.284 --> 04:02.503
Hallway's secure.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.069
Hotel's keeping things
under wraps.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.550
And I should be home eating
my wife's kringle right now.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.295
It's a pastry.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
Hey. Did you watch your sister's
interview last night?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.996
U-Uh, my TV's
on the fritz, so...

04:18.040 --> 04:19.302
[stammers]

04:19.346 --> 04:22.087
Why are we keeping this
under wraps?

04:22.131 --> 04:24.089
The victim is high-profile.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.439
This one's close to home.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.059
He's a cop.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.062
Ian Turner, chief of detectives.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.542
Room's under his name.

04:41.585 --> 04:42.891
You knew him?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.893
DANI:
He was a three-star.
Everybody did.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.374
Turner worked his way up
the ranks. 42 years of service.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.550
And he had a rep.
Squeaky clean.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.378
JT:
So squeaky clean,
he fought it out

04:51.421 --> 04:53.641
with a few dirtier cops
on his way up.

04:53.684 --> 04:57.209
Some people got no patience
for doing things by the book.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.735
BRIGHT:
Mm, this is no

05:00.778 --> 05:02.258
"by the book" exit.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.999
Who's the woman?

05:04.042 --> 05:05.392
Emily Hayes, 26.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
She had a misdemeanor
for prostitution.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.483
We're thinking murder,

05:09.526 --> 05:10.484
suicide.

05:10.527 --> 05:11.702
Yeah.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.313
I'm not seeing that.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.707
No defensive wounds.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.493
And why would Chief
Squeaky-Clean wear his badge

05:19.536 --> 05:20.972
to meet with a sex worker?

05:21.016 --> 05:23.888
I take it Turner had no history
of abuse or violence.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.760
-Why now?
-DANI: Turner obviously
had a secret.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.501
He was seeing a sex worker.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.590
Maybe Emily threatened
to turn him in.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.506
He shoots her, takes his
own life. Out of guilt.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.727
Are you finished
with the murder weapon?

05:36.771 --> 05:40.601
The suicide you're describing
is the result of deep shame.

05:40.644 --> 05:43.386
Turner killed a woman
in cold blood

05:43.430 --> 05:45.736
and violated everything
he ever stood for.

05:47.521 --> 05:50.654
He would have looked at her,
there on the bed.

05:50.698 --> 05:55.442
Adrenaline fading,
guilt building.

05:55.485 --> 06:00.621
Must have felt this growing
weight on his chest.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.710
Like a burden he couldn't lift.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.803
This was his only escape.
Suicide.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.109
But something's not quite right.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.024
-Looks that way.
-He wouldn't have been

06:13.068 --> 06:14.374
looking at the victim.

06:14.417 --> 06:18.203
He would've turned away.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.509
-Out of shame.
-Whoa.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.468
-Hey.
-Bright! Put the gun down now.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.732
It's not-- oh. Wait, it is.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.386
Ooh. Sorry.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.565
Do you have any idea
how stupid that was?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.394
Turner didn't kill himself.
There was a third person.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.048
Both victims were dressed,

06:37.092 --> 06:38.485
so Emily had just arrived.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.575
Perhaps Turner used
the dead bolt on the door

06:41.618 --> 06:43.620
to hold it open
so Emily could get in.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.666
The killer wouldn't need
a key to get in

06:45.709 --> 06:47.189
-if he acted fast.
-[gasps]

06:47.232 --> 06:48.582
He came in, hit Turner,

06:48.625 --> 06:51.759
took his gun and shot Emily.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.238
[Emily screams]

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
This wasn't a murder-suicide.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.894
It was a double homicide.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.768
Prove it.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.857
â™ª

07:05.860 --> 07:07.688
[horns honking]

07:07.731 --> 07:09.516
BRIGHT:
The killer dispatched Emily
with one shot,

07:09.559 --> 07:12.214
but took their time with Turner.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.955
Posed him.

07:13.998 --> 07:17.480
Turner was the target, Emily
was a casualty of circumstance.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.742
JT:
Revenge is usually personal.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.353
And Turner was in there
with a hooker, so...

07:21.397 --> 07:23.225
jealous wife, girlfriend?

07:23.268 --> 07:24.748
Uh, no. No family.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.054
Work was his life.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.012
Sounds like a lot of cops
I know.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.231
Sounds like you.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.667
BRIGHT:
I like JT's theory.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.539
Our killer was angry enough
that he plowed through

07:32.582 --> 07:35.063
an innocent woman
to get to his target.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.717
Who hated Turner that much?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.719
Every perp in Sing Sing.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.372
Let's set up in here.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.549
Good morning,
Lieutenant Arroyo.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.072
Thank you for this
accommodation.

07:44.115 --> 07:45.639
GIL:
Anything for the FBI,

07:45.682 --> 07:48.642
though I'm not sure
I had a choice.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.079
COLETTE:
Special Agent.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.647
No, wait. That's not right.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.563
What the hell do they
call you around here?

07:56.606 --> 07:59.653
Hello, Colette.
"Bright" usually works.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.481
Ah. Not for me.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.005
My task force has taken over
the Paul Lazar case.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.441
The Junkyard Killer,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.008
I know. We've been looking
into his past.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.445
Paul's motives are based
on a deep self-hatred.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.055
He was likely raised
by a single mother who...

08:11.099 --> 08:14.755
[chuckles] Wow. Less than 30
seconds to get to the bad mom.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.235
-That must be a new record.
-I was just...

08:17.279 --> 08:18.454
Blaming a woman
for a man's misdeeds?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.890
Yeah, I caught that, too.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.414
BRIGHT: I was simply
pointing out that serial killers

08:22.458 --> 08:25.505
aren't just born,
they're also made.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.595
And sometimes they're just born.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.336
Why don't you leave
your mommy issues at home?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.948
This case needs
a new perspective.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.037
I need bodies,
so who can you spare?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.606
I can't really spare anyone.
My team's working a homicide.

08:39.649 --> 08:41.346
It's Powell, right?

08:42.391 --> 08:43.566
Dani.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.959
Uh, how do you two
know each other?

08:45.002 --> 08:47.875
Colette's a profiler.
We worked together in D.C.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.093
Barely.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.792
I read your file.
I was really impressed.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.881
I need someone to walk me
through what you have.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.883
Is that something
you think you can do?

08:55.926 --> 08:59.582
[laughs softly]
Your commissioner promised me

08:59.626 --> 09:01.410
-the resources I need.
-Colette.

09:01.453 --> 09:03.107
Paul Lazar called me.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.631
I have a personal connection...

09:04.674 --> 09:05.849
With a serial killer, yes.

09:05.893 --> 09:08.025
That's the best reason yet
not to use you.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.072
GIL:
Take Dani.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.726
For 24 hours.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.381
You're with me.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.695
Merry Christmas.

09:30.744 --> 09:32.223
Turner's files.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.834
Go through his cases.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.618
Someone in there
wanted to kill him.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.189
[phone vibrating]

09:41.232 --> 09:42.756
[sighs]

09:42.799 --> 09:44.322
BRIGHT:
This is Bright.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.108
-Leave a message.
-Thanks. Just a friendly

09:47.151 --> 09:50.285
reminder that I need your ass
at Mom's tonight.

09:50.328 --> 09:54.724
Since the interview,
Mom is being very Mom right now.

10:02.819 --> 10:04.821
[sighs]

10:33.850 --> 10:35.939
-[door closes]
-SHANNON: Hey, Malcolm.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.985
Remember me?

10:38.028 --> 10:40.117
Detective Shannon.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.687
Yeah, we just wanted
to review your statement,

10:44.731 --> 10:47.603
the night that your father
was arrested.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.910
I already told you
everything I know.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.782
Yeah, but, um...

10:52.826 --> 10:54.349
here's the thing.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.743
The cop on the scene said that
he heard you and your dad

10:56.786 --> 10:59.136
share some parting words.

11:01.225 --> 11:04.576
"We're the same."

11:04.620 --> 11:07.057
Why do you think he said that?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.625
That's what I can't figure out.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.804
[horn honking in distance]

11:14.848 --> 11:16.284
I don't like this, Bright.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.720
Owen Shannon was a bad cop.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.549
I don't need to
remind you of that.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.551
Shannon was the last partner
Ian Turner had

11:22.594 --> 11:25.380
before he was promoted to chief.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.643
It's a lead.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.039
You sure you're okay seeing him?

11:32.082 --> 11:35.346
It was a long time ago.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.522
I'm not scared anymore.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.002
And he probably won't
recognize me.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.139
Well, look who it is.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.670
Gil Arroyo.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.803
What you want, Lucky Boy?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.675
Don't call me that.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.723
I heard you're Major Crimes.

12:03.766 --> 12:04.985
Congratulations.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.682
Is this how you greet
all your guests?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.944
There's someone out there
killing cops,

12:07.988 --> 12:09.903
and I'm sure as hell
not gonna be the next.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.861
How'd you know Turner's dead?

12:11.905 --> 12:13.863
My partner dies,
I'm gonna hear about it.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.387
Now, show some respect,

12:16.431 --> 12:18.868
Lucky Boy.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.964
[door closes]

12:28.008 --> 12:30.837
I worked The Surgeon case
for years.

12:30.880 --> 12:34.275
And one phone call
from some dumb kid,

12:34.318 --> 12:38.018
and-and Lucky Boy...

12:38.061 --> 12:40.194
gets the biggest collar
of the century.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.022
Still can't let it go, can you?

12:42.065 --> 12:44.067
There was more to that story.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.547
I knew it.

12:45.590 --> 12:50.117
Nobody... nobody listened to me.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.945
Good to see some things
never change.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.338
But we're here about
your old partner.

12:54.382 --> 12:57.298
After The Surgeon case,
you got reassigned to Turner.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.213
SHANNON:
And I hope

12:59.256 --> 13:00.562
he rots in hell.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.956
He ruined me.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.522
Looks like you did
all that to yourself.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.525
-You're a drunk, Shannon.
-Really?

13:07.569 --> 13:08.875
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.486
Turner made the right call.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.096
You were a bad cop,
and he knew it,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.011
so he tipped off Internal
Affairs and had you fired.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.404
Bright...

13:16.447 --> 13:18.928
You have a long-held grudge
against our victim.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.626
You're erratic and angry
and six beers in at 11:00 a.m.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.759
-Bah, humbug.
-You're also in possession

13:23.803 --> 13:25.239
of a likely unregistered handgun
that you jammed

13:25.282 --> 13:27.632
in our faces when we so much as
knocked on your door.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.982
You're our prime suspect.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.466
If I wanted Turner dead,

13:35.510 --> 13:36.816
I would have killed him
years ago.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.084
You did it last night.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.173
You killed Ian Turner
for getting you fired.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
And you hated him so much
that you murdered

13:48.915 --> 13:50.003
an innocent woman, too.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.874
What woman?

13:51.918 --> 13:54.050
Turner was found
with a sex worker.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.665
A hooker?
What, a-a female hooker?

14:01.449 --> 14:05.148
Chief Ian Turner...

14:05.192 --> 14:07.194
was gay.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.593
This is cozy.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.074
Special Agent Swanson does like
to mark her territory.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.120
I called a few old-timers;
they confirmed that

14:20.163 --> 14:21.034
Turner was gay.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.905
I guess it was an open secret.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.995
-If Turner didn't hire Emily...
-BRIGHT: Then the killer did.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.692
They were trying
to frame Turner.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.216
The victim's a choirboy.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.870
This was a character
assassination.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.262
The killer was trying
to smear Turner.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.003
A dead cop can't defend himself.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.875
Emily's our best lead.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.487
Emily Hayes. She was
a nursing student at NYU.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.924
Employed by Caged Bird,

14:41.968 --> 14:43.534
presenting as
a matchmaking company.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.406
Perfectly legal on the surface.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.451
Let me guess, the only
paying customers are men.

14:47.495 --> 14:51.629
Bingo. It's owned and operated
by Macy Barnes, a known madam.

14:51.673 --> 14:52.892
I'm tracking her.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.763
GIL:
Good work. Bright,

14:54.806 --> 14:55.982
keep combing through
Turner's files.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.026
Still might find something.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.378
COLETTE:
Do you trust Malcolm Bright,

15:01.422 --> 15:03.119
Detective Powell?

15:03.163 --> 15:05.643
He has some weird habits,

15:05.687 --> 15:08.298
he's unconventional,

15:08.342 --> 15:11.345
but yes, I trust him.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.476
Hmm.

15:12.520 --> 15:16.089
-Why?
-Because I don't.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.960
I don't think Malcolm has
divulged the full extent

15:18.004 --> 15:20.528
of his relationship
with our Junkyard Killer.

15:20.571 --> 15:22.486
[laughs softly]

15:22.530 --> 15:25.098
You don't need my help.
You just want eyes on Bright.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.491
He would never let
his personal interests

15:27.535 --> 15:28.840
get in the way of a case.

15:28.884 --> 15:30.320
-And can you say the same?
-Can you?

15:30.364 --> 15:34.629
Because I'm sensing that
you came here to bury Bright.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.153
We're all on the same side,
right?

15:39.808 --> 15:42.942
COLETTE:
This is footage of the incident
inside the transit tunnel.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.682
An old CCTV camera.

15:44.726 --> 15:47.033
Bright wrote in his report that
there were no words exchanged

15:47.076 --> 15:48.686
between him and Paul Lazar.

15:48.730 --> 15:51.385
But they were together
for two minutes and 28 seconds.

15:51.428 --> 15:53.604
Now, there's no audio,
but it sure as hell looks like

15:53.648 --> 15:55.041
they're talking to me.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.219
There's, um...

15:59.262 --> 16:00.829
there's got to be
an explanation.

16:00.872 --> 16:02.396
You're loyal, Detective.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.006
But don't let that blind you.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.096
Bright wasn't kicked out
of the FBI for one incident.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.969
It was a pattern of being
unconventional.

16:12.493 --> 16:14.538
Malcolm Bright is destructive.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.454
Don't let a man like that
ruin your career.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.947
-Jessica.
-[door closes]

16:31.991 --> 16:33.427
Malcolm just stepped out.
He should be right back.

16:33.470 --> 16:37.257
I'm not here for him.
I know what to do.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.042
If we can find the girl
in the box's body,

16:40.086 --> 16:42.262
we can put Martin Whitly away
for good.

16:42.305 --> 16:46.135
No visitations, no
consultations, no interviews.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.571
So, have you found her?

16:47.615 --> 16:49.138
Do you have any updates?

16:49.182 --> 16:50.618
You're starting to sound
just like Bright.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.837
Well, I'm just as invested.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.624
The FBI's doing
everything it can.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.060
[sighs]

16:58.104 --> 16:59.583
The only evidence we have is...

16:59.627 --> 17:01.281
the word of a serial killer,

17:01.324 --> 17:04.197
fragments of Malcolm's memory.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.676
It just isn't enough.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.201
Martin chloroformed my son.

17:08.244 --> 17:11.030
And now I can't
walk past a television

17:11.073 --> 17:12.379
without seeing his face.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.649
Let's get out of here.
I've got a bottle

17:21.692 --> 17:22.911
of bourbon in my desk drawer.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.696
How could a girl refuse?
[giggles]

17:25.740 --> 17:28.830
Oh, please, Gil.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.527
I have to fix this.

17:34.966 --> 17:37.404
You're always worrying
about everyone else.

17:37.447 --> 17:40.189
Let someone worry
about you for a change.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.587
Wait.

17:46.630 --> 17:47.936
You're not going to help me.

17:47.979 --> 17:50.939
This case has consumed Bright.

17:50.982 --> 17:55.074
I want to help by making sure
it doesn't do the same to you.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.597
You don't get to make
that decision.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.729
-[door opens]
-COLETTE: Lieutenant,
can I borrow you

17:58.773 --> 18:00.862
for a minute?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.126
-I'm, uh...
-[Jessica sighs]

18:05.736 --> 18:08.174
-I'll be right back.
-Mm.

18:18.619 --> 18:20.882
â™ª

18:26.409 --> 18:29.630
-[gasps]
-GIL: The girl in the box
was real.

18:29.673 --> 18:31.110
Paul Lazar gave us her bracelet.

18:48.388 --> 18:51.086
SHANNON:
You're just like your father.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.179
LAZAR:
It's in your blood.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.138
-There's hope for you yet.
-[grunts]

19:01.792 --> 19:02.924
[crying out]

19:02.967 --> 19:05.187
Bright, Bright, wake up!

19:10.627 --> 19:12.238
[door opens]

19:16.807 --> 19:18.200
Hey.

19:19.419 --> 19:20.594
[exhales]

19:20.637 --> 19:22.422
You good?

19:22.465 --> 19:26.034
I screwed things up
with the girl I'm seeing.

19:26.077 --> 19:27.688
She won't answer my calls.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.603
I think I scared her off.

19:29.646 --> 19:32.214
Eve, right? Yeah.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.434
JT told me about her.
Said she's great.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.829
Whatever the problem is,
I'm sure you can fix it.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.354
The problem is me.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.357
[chuckles]:
And I can't be fixed, so...

19:50.624 --> 19:52.365
I don't think that's true.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.371
How's your case?

20:00.677 --> 20:02.636
[sighs]

20:02.679 --> 20:04.812
Confusing. Yours?

20:04.855 --> 20:06.422
[sighs]

20:06.466 --> 20:09.599
JT's running down a lead
on Emily's escort agency.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.734
And I'm buried in files.

20:13.777 --> 20:16.824
Hmm. Merry Christmas to us.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.478
Ah.

20:19.522 --> 20:20.828
Oh...

20:20.871 --> 20:24.484
And I'm late for our family
Christmas dinner.

20:24.527 --> 20:25.702
Got to go.

20:30.141 --> 20:32.056
-[reporters clamoring]
-Ainsley Whitly, have you
visited your father

20:32.100 --> 20:33.275
since the interview?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.190
Is Martin Whitly
assisting the NYPD

20:35.234 --> 20:36.496
in their hunt for
The Junkyard Killer?

20:36.539 --> 20:38.672
Any breaking news
about my family

20:38.715 --> 20:40.587
is mine to report, thank you.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.458
-Ms. Whitly...
-Ainsley, what about your...

20:42.502 --> 20:45.331
-[clamoring continues faintly]
-[soft piano music playing]

20:45.374 --> 20:47.724
[door closes]

20:47.768 --> 20:50.118
Hello?

20:50.161 --> 20:52.294
Ah.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.427
You brought a twist-off.

20:54.470 --> 20:56.342
[sarcastic chuckle]

20:56.385 --> 20:58.387
Merry Christmas to you, too.

21:00.824 --> 21:03.436
-Did you watch it?
-[sighs]

21:03.479 --> 21:04.785
No comment.

21:04.828 --> 21:08.049
Can't you at least try
and be happy for me?

21:08.092 --> 21:09.355
I'm overjoyed, dear.

21:09.398 --> 21:10.965
My home is surrounded
by paparazzi

21:11.008 --> 21:12.532
and so-called journalists, your
father has finally succeeded

21:12.575 --> 21:15.491
in making me a prisoner
in my own home,

21:15.535 --> 21:18.407
and he had the assist from his
overly ambitious offspring.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.366
Ambition is not a dirty word.

21:20.409 --> 21:21.932
It's the best thing about me.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.499
That and my hair.

21:23.543 --> 21:27.416
Your father destroyed us.
Your brother and me.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.811
You put him on television
and let him talk about it.

21:30.854 --> 21:33.640
You have gone
and soaked yourself in blood.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.990
The press devoured us
20 years ago,

21:36.033 --> 21:37.731
and now they are at it again.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.515
You're playing the victim.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.741
I am not a victim,

21:47.784 --> 21:50.396
but there are victims,

21:50.439 --> 21:52.354
real ones.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.356
How do you think
those 23 families feel

21:54.400 --> 21:56.489
when they see you on television?

21:56.532 --> 21:59.622
And why is the story
never about them?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.364
I'm not going to apologize
for what I did.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.323
I used the media
to direct the narrative.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.802
What does that even mean?

22:05.846 --> 22:09.632
I'm telling my story,
not letting somebody else do it.

22:12.156 --> 22:13.462
I'm leaving.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.035
Ugh.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.863
Twist-offs are cool now.

22:22.906 --> 22:25.518
[door opens]

22:38.879 --> 22:40.576
Hey.

22:41.577 --> 22:42.665
Malcolm Whitly.

22:42.709 --> 22:45.538
I always knew that
you were a liar.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.628
And I didn't recognize you
till I saw your hand.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.543
You can change your name,

22:50.586 --> 22:53.502
but you can't change
who you are.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.549
Tell me the truth.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.072
Tell me what you did.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.204
Are you Daddy's little helper?

23:00.248 --> 23:02.163
You know more
than you are saying.

23:02.206 --> 23:03.469
Tell me how he did it.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.297
Tell me!

23:09.388 --> 23:11.564
I'm not my father.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.609
Are you trying to convince me
or trying to convince yourself?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.612
'Cause if you're trying to
convince me, save your breath!

23:16.656 --> 23:20.224
'Cause I was right.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.923
There was someone else.

23:22.966 --> 23:24.446
I know why you're angry.

23:24.490 --> 23:28.407
You dedicated your life
to The Surgeon's case.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.540
You were right.

23:31.584 --> 23:35.326
I did know something.
My father took me

23:35.370 --> 23:38.242
on a camping trip
with The Junkyard Killer.

23:38.286 --> 23:41.768
All I have are-are
fragments of a memory.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.294
Only The Surgeon and Paul Lazar
know what happened,

23:46.337 --> 23:49.645
but my father is in solitary,
and when I tried to find Paul,

23:49.689 --> 23:51.691
the FBI kicked me off the case
for being too...

23:51.734 --> 23:52.735
Obsessed?

23:54.650 --> 23:56.260
Unhinged?

23:58.001 --> 23:59.612
Making it personal?

23:59.655 --> 24:03.529
-Yes.
-I kind of know the feeling.

24:06.357 --> 24:07.707
Where are you
in the Turner case?

24:07.750 --> 24:10.405
We think the killer
has something to do

24:10.449 --> 24:13.321
with one of his old cases,

24:13.364 --> 24:14.844
but we haven't found
anything yet.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.894
Turner had a-a place
where he kept everything

24:20.937 --> 24:24.941
that he didn't want to release
to the official case files.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.989
I can take you there.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.556
Come on.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.604
GIL:
You're a hard woman
to track down,

24:35.648 --> 24:38.607
Ms. Barnes, which is odd,
since Caged Bird,

24:38.651 --> 24:40.522
your matchmaking company,
is perfectly legal.

24:40.566 --> 24:42.698
-Perfectly.
-But it's not.

24:42.742 --> 24:45.745
That's why Detective Turner
tried to shut you down.

24:45.788 --> 24:49.183
-You're behind this, Macy.
-I don't have to say anything.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.752
No, you don't...

24:52.795 --> 24:54.710
but you do have to
look at these.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.586
Come on, Macy.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.936
You had to protect
your business from Turner.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.503
That's why you killed them.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.636
-What? I didn't kill them.
-JT: I don't buy it.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.421
It was your girl in the room.
You sent her in.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.863
Yes, I sent her.

25:18.908 --> 25:21.171
But not to kill him.

25:21.215 --> 25:24.435
The only way to get Turner
off my back was to dirty him up.

25:24.479 --> 25:28.483
I was desperate. Emily needed
the money to finish school,

25:28.527 --> 25:31.355
so she told Turner
she'd be his informant.

25:31.399 --> 25:33.357
She was supposed to
go to the room,

25:33.401 --> 25:36.622
seduce him and take photos,

25:36.665 --> 25:39.755
but she never came back.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.801
I was certain Turner killed her.

25:43.063 --> 25:45.239
God knows I didn't.

25:45.282 --> 25:49.548
Wait, if it wasn't him,
who did this?

26:01.864 --> 26:04.563
[car door closes]

26:04.606 --> 26:06.565
[car door opens]

26:09.480 --> 26:11.352
What is this place?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.834
Turner was a private guy.

26:14.877 --> 26:18.141
He liked the quiet out here.

26:18.185 --> 26:21.275
You've been here before?

26:21.318 --> 26:24.670
Not in 15 years.

26:24.713 --> 26:26.933
We were partners.

26:26.976 --> 26:29.805
We used to come and work
out here sometimes.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.663
â™ª

27:12.587 --> 27:15.068
This isn't about Caged Bird.

27:15.111 --> 27:19.550
Turner was investigating
The Junkyard Killer.

27:24.947 --> 27:27.950
Why was Turner looking
into The Junkyard Killer?

27:27.994 --> 27:30.518
He never even worked
on The Surgeon case.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.824
Yeah, but I did.

27:31.867 --> 27:35.566
These are all my files
from 20 years ago.

27:36.829 --> 27:38.961
I always thought there was more,

27:39.005 --> 27:43.052
that Martin must've had
a cleanup man,

27:43.096 --> 27:45.011
but my higher-ups

27:45.054 --> 27:47.883
closed the case.

27:47.927 --> 27:49.276
They called it a day.

27:49.319 --> 27:51.800
-You kept digging.
-Uh, hell yeah, I kept digging.

27:51.844 --> 27:53.715
I was blackballed
for my trouble.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.370
By the time Turner showed up,

27:56.413 --> 27:59.025
I was pretty well spent.

27:59.068 --> 28:01.810
You know, he-he put up
with me until...

28:03.246 --> 28:04.987
...until he couldn't.

28:05.031 --> 28:09.688
And he gave up on me
like-like everyone else did.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.778
I don't think he did.

28:12.821 --> 28:14.083
Look around.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.956
Turner did all this for you.

28:16.999 --> 28:18.914
When the news about
The Junkyard Killer came out,

28:18.958 --> 28:21.874
he must've dug up
all your old case files.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.919
He was trying
to clear your name.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.880
Damn it.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.058
Damn him for being a good guy.

28:38.238 --> 28:40.022
For being my guy.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.722
You and Turner
were in a relationship.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.333
I spent ten years
of my life hating him

28:46.376 --> 28:49.075
for ruining my career,
when all he was trying to do

28:49.118 --> 28:51.077
was save me from myself.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.862
And now he's dead.

28:53.906 --> 28:56.430
And I just...

28:56.473 --> 28:58.519
I want him to know that I...

28:58.562 --> 29:00.826
I just want him to know
that... that...

29:07.267 --> 29:10.096
He knew.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.315
All this,

29:12.359 --> 29:14.753
all this was because
he believed in you, Shannon.

29:18.278 --> 29:21.020
What?

29:21.063 --> 29:23.413
Turner was running down
my suspects.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.980
You had suspects?

29:25.024 --> 29:27.069
Everyone I thought
that might be helping Martin.

29:27.113 --> 29:29.768
If there was a stone,
we turned it over. Now don't get

29:29.811 --> 29:31.117
too excited,
each one was a dead end.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.945
Not if we compare them
to my list.

29:32.988 --> 29:36.296
The Surgeon met The Junkyard
Killer at St. Edward's Hospital.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.777
We narrowed it down
to a possible 50 names.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.781
So if a name is on both lists...

29:43.869 --> 29:47.002
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't get to be so lucky.

29:47.046 --> 29:49.613
It's not luck
if it took 20 years.

29:52.442 --> 29:55.445
-SHANNON: Wade?
-BRIGHT: No.

29:55.489 --> 29:57.360
-Waits.
-No.

29:57.404 --> 30:00.668
-Walker.
-Nope.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.237
Watkins.

30:06.413 --> 30:07.718
Watkins.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.895
Uh, John Watkins.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.635
Holy hell,
I remember John Watkins.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.681
He was a really strange guy.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.248
He used to work swing shifts
at the hospital.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.076
I have an address.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.729
It's 20 years old, but still.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.254
[both chuckle]

30:22.908 --> 30:24.866
[car doors closing]

30:35.485 --> 30:38.619
Smile, kid.
This is the fun part.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.273
Don't worry.

30:40.316 --> 30:42.971
You were right before,

30:43.015 --> 30:46.932
-it's not registered.
-Oh, well, in that case.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.629
[phone vibrating]

30:49.935 --> 30:53.721
Gil. Hey. I got a lead.

30:53.764 --> 30:55.984
So do I.
Macy didn't do it.

30:56.028 --> 31:00.032
So the frame job and the murder
were two separate crimes.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.034
Turner was investigating
The Junkyard Killer,

31:02.077 --> 31:04.036
-so maybe...
-W-W-Wait, what?

31:04.079 --> 31:06.038
Maybe he found out
Turner was on his case,

31:06.081 --> 31:08.475
a little too close
to the truth,

31:08.518 --> 31:10.085
so he follows him to the hotel,

31:10.129 --> 31:12.174
didn't expect him to be there
with a sex worker,

31:12.218 --> 31:14.960
but who cares,
he's there to kill a cop;

31:15.003 --> 31:17.005
he'll happily
throw in Emily, too.

31:17.049 --> 31:18.224
Wait, are you saying

31:18.267 --> 31:20.226
that our murderer
is The Junkyard Killer?

31:20.269 --> 31:24.012
We were working the case
this entire time.

31:24.056 --> 31:27.581
I may be blind,
but I'm not deaf.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.713
-What do you want?
-I got to go.

31:29.757 --> 31:30.976
Uh, no, Bright, are you...

31:31.019 --> 31:32.934
-[dial tone]
-Damn it.

31:32.978 --> 31:36.111
Unless you plan on singing,
get off my front step.

31:36.155 --> 31:39.288
Uh, Merry Christmas.
We're looking for John Watkins.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.900
Do you know if he
used to live here?

31:41.943 --> 31:44.293
My sweet John.

31:44.337 --> 31:47.079
Of course he did.

31:47.122 --> 31:50.038
How do you know my grandson?

31:51.866 --> 31:54.086
We're old friends.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.007
â™ª Said the night wind
to the little lambâ™ª

32:02.050 --> 32:04.183
â™ª Do you see what I see?â™ª

32:05.793 --> 32:08.013
Why are you smiling?

32:08.056 --> 32:11.016
This is John's childhood home.

32:11.059 --> 32:14.889
That's, like, the Holy Grail
for profilers.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.633
Serial killers aren't just born,
they're made.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.983
And John was made...

32:22.027 --> 32:23.419
right here.

32:23.463 --> 32:27.162
Religion played a prominent role
in his development.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.905
It impacts the way he kills.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.168
His messianic mission.

32:33.212 --> 32:35.736
[whispers]:
There are clues everywhere.

32:35.779 --> 32:37.738
MATILDA:
I thought I told you

32:37.781 --> 32:40.045
to sit.

32:40.088 --> 32:43.309
â™ª Do you hear what I hear?â™ª

32:44.963 --> 32:48.618
Just remember to peel back
the plastic.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.359
Sometimes I forget.

32:50.403 --> 32:52.883
Thank you for the meal,
Mrs. Watkins.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.148
We were wondering, uh...

32:58.193 --> 33:00.413
-...if you'd seen John recently.
-Oh.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.502
It's Matilda, please.

33:02.545 --> 33:06.245
Now, how did you know
my Johnnie again?

33:07.289 --> 33:08.595
SHANNON:
We worked with him

33:08.638 --> 33:10.684
at St. Edward's.

33:10.727 --> 33:13.774
He always said

33:13.817 --> 33:16.690
he made good friends there.

33:16.733 --> 33:19.606
Ah, everyone loves John.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.956
I raised him to be a good boy.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.176
Were John's parents around
when he was a kid?

33:24.219 --> 33:26.700
No father that I knew.

33:26.743 --> 33:30.051
Least of his worries, though,
with that mother.

33:30.095 --> 33:32.706
She was a sinner.

33:32.749 --> 33:36.275
Filthy whore till she died.

33:36.318 --> 33:40.279
Chose heroin over her own child.

33:40.322 --> 33:43.630
You want his real mother,
you see me.

33:43.673 --> 33:45.284
That must have been hard.

33:45.327 --> 33:49.070
God doesn't put us here
to do easy things, son.

33:49.114 --> 33:52.117
Just right ones.

33:53.509 --> 33:56.121
Would you like something else?

33:59.428 --> 34:03.302
No. I'm... It's fine.

34:03.345 --> 34:07.828
Guests in this house deserve
better than fine.

34:07.871 --> 34:10.265
Sit tight.

34:10.309 --> 34:13.225
MATILDA [softly]:
â™ª There is a fountain...â™ª

34:13.268 --> 34:14.661
[quietly]:
So he lost his parents young.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.836
I mean, that's rough.

34:15.879 --> 34:19.013
But Grandma, she's not bad.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.667
Could learn to cook, maybe.

34:20.710 --> 34:24.105
It's all here. In Matilda.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.108
John targets people
on the fringe

34:27.152 --> 34:29.197
because of what she made him
believe as a child.

34:29.241 --> 34:34.507
That his mother was a sinner,
that addicts are evil.

34:34.550 --> 34:36.161
[footsteps approaching]

34:36.204 --> 34:37.118
Oh.

34:37.162 --> 34:38.946
-Oh...
-MATILDA: There we go.

34:40.904 --> 34:42.515
-Oh...
-Uh...

34:42.558 --> 34:44.995
That rust is a food group.

34:48.260 --> 34:53.874
Uh, Matilda,
do you have any photos of John?

34:53.917 --> 34:55.528
We'd love to see him as a kid.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.052
I do.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.152
BRIGHT:
Uh, who's Benjamin?

35:11.196 --> 35:12.632
MATILDA:
Oh, my husband.

35:12.675 --> 35:15.896
He was a good father to Johnnie.

35:15.939 --> 35:17.289
Pushed him to be his best.

35:17.332 --> 35:22.642
But my poor Johnnie
had to watch him die.

35:22.685 --> 35:27.081
Benjamin was working
on his car in the garage.

35:27.125 --> 35:31.303
Like a bolt of lightning
straight from God,

35:31.346 --> 35:35.742
the car fell
and crushed his head.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.657
Horrible accident.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.833
[paper shuffling]

35:39.876 --> 35:42.357
And this is his first communion.

35:49.277 --> 35:53.325
And his first day
of junior high.

35:53.368 --> 35:55.849
So handsome.

35:55.892 --> 36:01.115
Family is everything.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.163
-[reporters clamoring]
-Mrs. Whitly!
We have more questions!

36:05.206 --> 36:07.121
-[clamoring continues faintly]
-[sighs]

36:07.165 --> 36:09.254
JESSICA:
If we can find the girl
in the box's body,

36:09.297 --> 36:12.779
we can put Martin Whitly
away for good.

36:12.822 --> 36:15.347
AINSLEY: I used the media
to direct the narrative.

36:15.390 --> 36:17.349
JESSICA:
What does that even mean?

36:17.392 --> 36:20.830
MARTIN:
You're right.
We have been happy.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.484
You'll be back.

36:27.359 --> 36:30.318
"Direct the narrative."

36:30.362 --> 36:32.668
[sighs]

36:32.712 --> 36:34.801
SHANNON:
No use.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.237
They're all the same.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.021
I think that John
was here recently.

36:38.065 --> 36:40.894
He knew if Turner was onto him,
that people would come looking.

36:40.937 --> 36:44.158
So he made sure we wouldn't be
able to I.D. him when you did.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.248
See if you can find out
when he was last here.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.424
I'm gonna take a look around.

36:49.468 --> 36:51.470
Matilda,
can I use your bathroom?

36:51.513 --> 36:53.559
"May" I use your bathroom.

36:53.602 --> 36:57.302
Poor grammar is just
a short walk

36:57.345 --> 37:00.087
to delinquency.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.656
And you may.

37:03.699 --> 37:07.703
First door at the top
of the stairs.

37:09.531 --> 37:11.403
Delicious.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.361
Thank you. Thank you.

37:19.062 --> 37:21.282

Please...

38:26.216 --> 38:28.393
[sobbing]

38:36.183 --> 38:37.663
Colette.
[clears throat]

38:37.706 --> 38:41.362
Colette? The Junkyard Killer
murdered Turner and Emily.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.146
-Bright has a lead on him.
-What?

38:43.190 --> 38:45.497
Your boy's been working my case
this entire time

38:45.540 --> 38:47.412
even though I explicitly
told him not to?

38:47.455 --> 38:49.501
Where is he?

38:51.198 --> 38:54.332
Where is Bright right now?

38:54.375 --> 38:56.334
GIL:
We...

38:56.377 --> 38:58.248
don't know.

38:59.206 --> 39:01.817
[phone vibrating]

39:03.558 --> 39:06.387
MATILDA:
No phones at the table, Mr. Man.

39:06.431 --> 39:10.130
Now, John, he was a quiet boy.

39:10.173 --> 39:12.611
Very observant. Watchful.

39:12.654 --> 39:16.528
He spent hours in the garage
with Benjamin.

39:16.571 --> 39:20.532
He was interested in the way
things worked.

39:20.575 --> 39:24.231
-John's here.
-MATILDA: Johnnie is home?

39:24.274 --> 39:27.365
Just in time for pie!

39:32.065 --> 39:33.849
No, no.

39:33.893 --> 39:37.723
John, my dear. You forgot one.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.248
You knew. You called him.

39:41.291 --> 39:43.468
Where is he? Where is John?

39:43.511 --> 39:46.384
My Johnnie takes out the trash!

39:46.427 --> 39:47.515
[gate closes outside]

39:51.606 --> 39:54.217
John! He's in here!

39:54.261 --> 39:57.656
He's gonna get you.

39:57.699 --> 39:58.874

40:09.929 --> 40:13.672
â™ª Holy nightâ™ª

40:13.715 --> 40:16.326
â™ª All is calm...â™ª

40:16.370 --> 40:19.025
As you know,
my ex-husband Martin Whitly

40:19.068 --> 40:21.636
is a convicted serial murderer.

40:22.550 --> 40:24.465
He's in a psychiatric hospital

40:24.509 --> 40:27.076
for killing 23 people.

40:27.120 --> 40:28.513
But I believe there were more.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.254
-Mrs. Whitly!
-[reporters clamoring]

40:31.298 --> 40:32.647
This bracelet,

40:32.691 --> 40:36.390
which is in evidence
and under FBI jurisdiction,

40:36.434 --> 40:39.088
holds the key to the identity

40:39.132 --> 40:43.266
of The Surgeon's 24th victim.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.399
[phone chimes]

40:45.443 --> 40:47.140
Instead of turning your eyes

40:47.183 --> 40:48.881
on my family this Christmas...

40:48.924 --> 40:51.449
-You've got to be kidding.
-...use this clue

40:51.492 --> 40:53.407
to help me uncover the identity

40:53.451 --> 40:54.756
of this woman.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.454
John?

40:56.497 --> 40:57.716
I know you're here.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.500
JESSICA:
I hereby offer a reward

40:59.544 --> 41:03.025
in the amount of $1 million
for information

41:03.069 --> 41:06.507
that leads to the truth
about the owner of this bracelet

41:06.551 --> 41:10.555
which is engraved
with the initials AMS.

41:10.598 --> 41:11.556
[soft clattering]

41:11.599 --> 41:12.992
[grunts]

41:13.035 --> 41:16.038
-[siren wailing]
-Bright still isn't picking up.

41:16.082 --> 41:19.651
-JESSICA: It is my hope...
-I have a bad feeling
about this.

41:19.694 --> 41:20.782
...that together,

41:20.826 --> 41:25.744
we can see that justice,
real justice,

41:25.787 --> 41:28.398
is finally served.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.447
[clamoring resumes]

41:34.622 --> 41:36.624
â™ª

41:43.588 --> 41:46.678
We have to stop
meeting like this.

41:50.029 --> 41:51.813
Remember me?

41:52.727 --> 41:54.599
[quietly]:
They'll find you.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.777
They'll never find us
where we're going.

42:11.746 --> 42:13.618
JOHN:
Your dad buy you that?

42:13.661 --> 42:14.793
Yeah.

42:14.836 --> 42:18.013
Everybody needs a good knife.

42:18.057 --> 42:21.277
Y-You never know
when it'll come in handy.

42:21.321 --> 42:24.585
-My dad says that, too.
-Smart guy.

42:25.847 --> 42:27.153
Can I see it?

42:27.196 --> 42:28.589
Yeah.

42:30.678 --> 42:32.898
[knife clicks]

42:38.686 --> 42:40.470
What's in the trunk?

42:42.342 --> 42:43.735
I'll tell you.

42:45.867 --> 42:48.914
But you got to promise
to keep a secret.

42:57.139 --> 42:59.359
Your brother doesn't know
what fun he's missing.

42:59.402 --> 43:01.840
Hmm.

43:01.883 --> 43:03.885
Lucky him.

43:06.888 --> 43:08.890
[sighs]

43:46.885 --> 43:48.669

Greg, move your head.
