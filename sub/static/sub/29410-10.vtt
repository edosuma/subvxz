ANNOUNCER:
Tonight on
American Direct News...

00:05.788 --> 00:08.486
MARTIN:
What consoles me
is that as a doctor,

00:08.530 --> 00:11.402
I saved thousands of lives.

00:11.446 --> 00:15.145
So if we're judging
the moral worth of a person

00:15.189 --> 00:17.191
based on the mark
they leave on the world,

00:17.234 --> 00:20.455
mine is a... a net positive.

00:20.498 --> 00:24.285
Dr. Martin Whitly murdered
23 people as The Surgeon,

00:24.328 --> 00:27.288
making him one of the world's
most notorious serial killers.

00:27.331 --> 00:30.682
I'm Ainsley Whitly
forAmerican Direct News,

00:30.726 --> 00:33.816
and The Surgeon is my father.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.123
MARTIN:
I was, um,

00:36.166 --> 00:37.124
a mentor.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.474
I'm not a perfect man.

00:39.517 --> 00:40.910
It's true.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.868
Isn't that what counts?

00:42.912 --> 00:44.261
[echoing]:
That in the end,

00:44.305 --> 00:45.523
I did some good?

00:45.567 --> 00:46.872
AINSLEY:
What kind of a father

00:46.916 --> 00:48.004
-does that?
-Stop it!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.745
I was a good father, damn it!

00:49.788 --> 00:51.573
Say that again.
Say I was a terrible father!

00:51.616 --> 00:53.923
[glass shatters]

00:56.969 --> 01:00.147
-[sighs]
-Mother...

01:00.190 --> 01:01.844
-My TV.
-I thought we agreed

01:01.887 --> 01:03.672
to avoid watching this garbage.

01:03.715 --> 01:05.021
No, you agreed.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.631
I thought it best not to argue.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.590
Is this your plan?
To foil Ainsley's ratings

01:08.633 --> 01:11.245
by destroying every television
in America?

01:11.288 --> 01:14.030
-Ugh.
-God knows you have
enough shoes.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.032
I don't know why
you torture yourself.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.034
I thought you were newly devoted
to being "normal."

01:18.078 --> 01:22.169
Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.127
[exhales]

01:24.171 --> 01:27.348
Why didn't you tell me?
The girl in the box.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.351
The memories. You have proof.
They're all real.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.179
How did you...

01:34.398 --> 01:35.573
Gil.

01:35.617 --> 01:40.187
We told you they weren't real
for years.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.885
Of course you're not normal.
How could you be?

01:42.928 --> 01:45.148
It's not your fault. Or Gil's.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.890
Martin Whitly did this to me.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.197
He manipulated me,
he drugged me.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.068
-Drugged you?
-He used chloroform.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
To confuse me.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.333
To help me forget.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.470
I thought he loved you.

02:02.513 --> 02:08.215
That at least he took care
of you, and your sister.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.262
I'm sorry.

02:13.307 --> 02:15.831
Thank you.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.659
But you don't have to say that.

02:17.702 --> 02:20.357
I really do.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.449
And I have to clear the air
before tomorrow night.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.104
Christmas, dear.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.323
It's an annual holiday?

02:29.366 --> 02:31.107
Maybe you've noticed
the decorations

02:31.151 --> 02:34.110
and that handsy Santa
outside Gristedes?

02:34.893 --> 02:37.200
I'm not feeling very festive.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.597
Your father has taken
so much from us.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.556
Don't let him take this.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.777
[piano playing "We Wish You
a Merry Christmas"]

02:48.820 --> 02:51.083
[laughter]

02:53.825 --> 02:55.784
Sorry to call you in
on Christmas.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.613
It's okay. I was in
the neighborhood caroling.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.876
No sign of ESU or CSU?

03:00.919 --> 03:03.444
They're already upstairs.
We're keeping this quiet.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.880
Oh, yeah?

03:04.923 --> 03:08.710
Keeping secrets doesn't seem
to be your strong suit.

03:08.753 --> 03:10.581
My mother dropped by last night.

03:10.625 --> 03:13.280
She was gonna find out
soon enough.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.370
Better it came from one of us.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.067
Are there any updates
in the Paul Lazar case

03:18.110 --> 03:19.242
I need to know about?

03:19.286 --> 03:21.244
I don't have any answers.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.550
Neither does the FBI.

03:22.593 --> 03:24.943
Their task force is moving
into the precinct.

03:24.987 --> 03:27.294
-Oh, they'll want
to question me.
-They very much

03:27.337 --> 03:29.383
do not want to question you.

03:29.426 --> 03:32.037
The special agent in charge
is Colette...

03:32.081 --> 03:34.692
[sighs]
Swanson?

03:34.736 --> 03:37.565
We worked together in D.C.

03:37.608 --> 03:39.001
She hates me.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.264
Oh, yeah.
[laughs]

03:41.308 --> 03:43.397
Said to keep you out of her way.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.573
That all she said?

03:45.616 --> 03:49.185
There were other words,
but why ruin your holidays?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.448
Come on. I got something
that'll cheer you up.

03:54.059 --> 03:56.279
[sighs]

03:57.106 --> 03:59.064
Merry Christmas.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.370
Happy Hanukkah?

04:01.284 --> 04:02.503
Hallway's secure.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.069
Hotel's keeping things
under wraps.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.550
And I should be home eating
my wife's kringle right now.

04:09.553 --> 04:12.295
It's a pastry.

04:12.339 --> 04:15.298
Hey. Did you watch your sister's
interview last night?

04:15.342 --> 04:17.996
U-Uh, my TV's
on the fritz, so...

04:18.040 --> 04:19.302
[stammers]

04:19.346 --> 04:22.087
Why are we keeping this
under wraps?

04:22.131 --> 04:24.089
The victim is high-profile.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.439
This one's close to home.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.059
He's a cop.

04:37.102 --> 04:40.062
Ian Turner, chief of detectives.

04:40.105 --> 04:41.542
Room's under his name.

04:41.585 --> 04:42.891
You knew him?

04:42.934 --> 04:44.893
DANI:
He was a three-star.
Everybody did.

04:44.936 --> 04:47.374
Turner worked his way up
the ranks. 42 years of service.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.550
And he had a rep.
Squeaky clean.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.378
JT:
So squeaky clean,
he fought it out

04:51.421 --> 04:53.641
with a few dirtier cops
on his way up.

04:53.684 --> 04:57.209
Some people got no patience
for doing things by the book.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.735
BRIGHT:
Mm, this is no

05:00.778 --> 05:02.258
"by the book" exit.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.999
Who's the woman?

05:04.042 --> 05:05.392
Emily Hayes, 26.

05:05.435 --> 05:07.350
She had a misdemeanor
for prostitution.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.483
We're thinking murder,

05:09.526 --> 05:10.484
suicide.

05:10.527 --> 05:11.702
Yeah.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.313
I'm not seeing that.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.707
No defensive wounds.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.493
And why would Chief
Squeaky-Clean wear his badge

05:19.536 --> 05:20.972
to meet with a sex worker?

05:21.016 --> 05:23.888
I take it Turner had no history
of abuse or violence.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.760
-Why now?
-DANI: Turner obviously
had a secret.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.501
He was seeing a sex worker.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.590
Maybe Emily threatened
to turn him in.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.506
He shoots her, takes his
own life. Out of guilt.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.727
Are you finished
with the murder weapon?

05:36.771 --> 05:40.601
The suicide you're describing
is the result of deep shame.

05:40.644 --> 05:43.386
Turner killed a woman
in cold blood

05:43.430 --> 05:45.736
and violated everything
he ever stood for.

05:47.521 --> 05:50.654
He would have looked at her,
there on the bed.

05:50.698 --> 05:55.442
Adrenaline fading,
guilt building.

05:55.485 --> 06:00.621
Must have felt this growing
weight on his chest.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.710
Like a burden he couldn't lift.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.803
This was his only escape.
Suicide.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.109
But something's not quite right.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.024
-Looks that way.
-He wouldn't have been

06:13.068 --> 06:14.374
looking at the victim.

06:14.417 --> 06:18.203
He would've turned away.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.509
-Out of shame.
-Whoa.

06:19.553 --> 06:21.468
-Hey.
-Bright! Put the gun down now.

06:21.511 --> 06:24.732
It's not-- oh. Wait, it is.

06:24.775 --> 06:26.386
Ooh. Sorry.

06:29.563 --> 06:31.565
Do you have any idea
how stupid that was?

06:31.608 --> 06:34.394
Turner didn't kill himself.
There was a third person.

06:34.437 --> 06:37.048
Both victims were dressed,

06:37.092 --> 06:38.485
so Emily had just arrived.

06:38.528 --> 06:41.575
Perhaps Turner used
the dead bolt on the door

06:41.618 --> 06:43.620
to hold it open
so Emily could get in.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.666
The killer wouldn't need
a key to get in

06:45.709 --> 06:47.189
-if he acted fast.
-[gasps]

06:47.232 --> 06:48.582
He came in, hit Turner,

06:48.625 --> 06:51.759
took his gun and shot Emily.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.238
[Emily screams]

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
This wasn't a murder-suicide.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.894
It was a double homicide.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.768
Prove it.

♪

07:05.860 --> 07:07.688
[horns honking]

07:07.731 --> 07:09.516
BRIGHT:
The killer dispatched Emily
with one shot,

07:09.559 --> 07:12.214
but took their time with Turner.

07:12.257 --> 07:13.955
Posed him.

07:13.998 --> 07:17.480
Turner was the target, Emily
was a casualty of circumstance.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.742
JT:
Revenge is usually personal.

07:18.786 --> 07:21.353
And Turner was in there
with a hooker, so...

07:21.397 --> 07:23.225
jealous wife, girlfriend?

07:23.268 --> 07:24.748
Uh, no. No family.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.054
Work was his life.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.012
Sounds like a lot of cops
I know.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.231
Sounds like you.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.667
BRIGHT:
I like JT's theory.

07:30.711 --> 07:32.539
Our killer was angry enough
that he plowed through

07:32.582 --> 07:35.063
an innocent woman
to get to his target.

07:35.106 --> 07:36.717
Who hated Turner that much?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.719
Every perp in Sing Sing.

Let's set up in here.

Good morning,
Lieutenant Arroyo.

Thank you for this
accommodation.

Anything for the FBI,

I had a choice.

COLETTE:
Special Agent.

07:51.122 --> 07:53.647
No, wait. That's not right.

07:53.690 --> 07:56.563
What the hell do they
call you around here?

07:56.606 --> 07:59.653
Hello, Colette.
"Bright" usually works.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.481
Ah. Not for me.

08:01.524 --> 08:04.005
My task force has taken over
the Paul Lazar case.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.441
The Junkyard Killer,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.008
I know. We've been looking
into his past.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.445
Paul's motives are based
on a deep self-hatred.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.055
He was likely raised
by a single mother who...

08:11.099 --> 08:14.755
[chuckles] Wow. Less than 30
seconds to get to the bad mom.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.235
-That must be a new record.
-I was just...

08:17.279 --> 08:18.454
Blaming a woman
for a man's misdeeds?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.890
Yeah, I caught that, too.

08:19.934 --> 08:22.414
BRIGHT: I was simply
pointing out that serial killers

08:22.458 --> 08:25.505
aren't just born,
they're also made.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.595
And sometimes they're just born.

08:28.638 --> 08:31.336
Why don't you leave
your mommy issues at home?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.948
This case needs
a new perspective.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.037
I need bodies,
so who can you spare?

08:36.080 --> 08:39.606
I can't really spare anyone.

Uh, how do you two
know each other?

We worked together in D.C.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.093
Barely.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.792
I read your file.
I was really impressed.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.881
I need someone to walk me
through what you have.

Is that something
you think you can do?

09:04.674 --> 09:05.849
With a serial killer, yes.

not to use you.

Yeah, we just wanted

10:54.392 --> 10:56.743

he heard you and your dad

10:56.786 --> 10:59.136

11:01.225 --> 11:04.576
"We're the same."

11:04.620 --> 11:07.057
Why do you think he said that?

That's what I can't figure out.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.284

11:16.327 --> 11:17.720
Owen Shannon was a bad cop.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.549
I don't need to
remind you of that.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.551
Shannon was the last partner
Ian Turner had

11:22.594 --> 11:25.380
before he was promoted to chief.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.643
It's a lead.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.039
You sure you're okay seeing him?

11:32.082 --> 11:35.346
It was a long time ago.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.522
I'm not scared anymore.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.002
And he probably won't
recognize me.

11:43.485 --> 11:45.139
Well, look who it is.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.670

11:54.714 --> 11:56.803
What you want, Lucky Boy?

11:58.587 --> 11:59.675
Don't call me that.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.723
I heard you're Major Crimes.

12:03.766 --> 12:04.985
Congratulations.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.682
Is this how you greet
all your guests?

12:06.726 --> 12:07.944
There's someone out there
killing cops,

12:07.988 --> 12:09.903

not gonna be the next.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.861

12:11.905 --> 12:13.863

I'm gonna hear about it.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.837
I worked The Surgeon case
for years.

There was more to that story.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.547
I knew it.

12:45.590 --> 12:50.117
Nobody... nobody listened to me.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.945
Good to see some things
never change.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.338
But we're here about
your old partner.

12:54.382 --> 12:57.298
After The Surgeon case,
you got reassigned to Turner.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.213
SHANNON:
And I hope

12:59.256 --> 13:00.562
he rots in hell.

13:01.563 --> 13:02.956
He ruined me.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.522
Looks like you did
all that to yourself.

13:04.566 --> 13:07.525
-You're a drunk, Shannon.
-Really?

13:07.569 --> 13:08.875
Well, everybody needs a hobby.

13:08.918 --> 13:11.486
Turner made the right call.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.096
You were a bad cop,
and he knew it,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.011
so he tipped off Internal
Affairs and had you fired.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.404
Bright...

13:16.447 --> 13:18.928
You have a long-held grudge
against our victim.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.626
You're erratic and angry
and six beers in at 11:00 a.m.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.759
-Bah, humbug.
-You're also in possession

13:23.803 --> 13:25.239
of a likely unregistered handgun
that you jammed

13:25.282 --> 13:27.632
in our faces when we so much as
knocked on your door.

13:27.676 --> 13:28.982
You're our prime suspect.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.466
If I wanted Turner dead,

13:35.510 --> 13:36.816
I would have killed him
years ago.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.084
You did it last night.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.173
You killed Ian Turner
for getting you fired.

13:46.216 --> 13:48.871
And you hated him so much
that you murdered

13:48.915 --> 13:50.003
an innocent woman, too.

13:50.046 --> 13:51.874
What woman?

13:51.918 --> 13:54.050
Turner was found
with a sex worker.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.665
A hooker?
What, a-a female hooker?

14:01.449 --> 14:05.148
Chief Ian Turner...

14:05.192 --> 14:07.194
was gay.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.593
This is cozy.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.074
Special Agent Swanson does like
to mark her territory.

14:18.118 --> 14:20.120
I called a few old-timers;
they confirmed that

14:20.163 --> 14:21.034
Turner was gay.

14:21.077 --> 14:22.905
I guess it was an open secret.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.995
-If Turner didn't hire Emily...
-BRIGHT: Then the killer did.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.692
They were trying
to frame Turner.

14:27.736 --> 14:29.216
The victim's a choirboy.

14:29.259 --> 14:30.870
This was a character
assassination.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.262
The killer was trying
to smear Turner.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.003
A dead cop can't defend himself.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.875
Emily's our best lead.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.487
Emily Hayes. She was
a nursing student at NYU.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.924
Employed by Caged Bird,

14:41.968 --> 14:43.534
presenting as
a matchmaking company.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.406
Perfectly legal on the surface.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.451

paying customers are men.

14:47.495 --> 14:51.629

by Macy Barnes, a known madam.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.119

15:05.687 --> 15:08.298

-Because I don't.

I don't think Malcolm has
divulged the full extent

15:18.004 --> 15:20.528
of his relationship
with our Junkyard Killer.

You don't need my help.
You just want eyes on Bright.

his personal interests

-Can you?

there were no words exchanged

unconventional.
