WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.073
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.073 --> 00:04.003
YOU'RE MARRYING HIM
FOR HIS MONEY?

00:04.003 --> 00:07.478
LYNETTE HAD RESERVATIONS
ABOUT HER MOTHER'S MARRIAGE.

00:07.478 --> 00:10.181
YOU CAN'T MARRY
AN OBNOXIOUS JERK LIKE THAT.

00:10.181 --> 00:12.413
SUSAN BEGAN HER WAIT
FOR A KIDNEY DONOR.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.485
I'M GOING ON THE WAIT LIST.
 THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.

00:14.485 --> 00:18.018
BREE FOUND OUT
THAT KEITH HAD A SON

00:18.018 --> 00:20.151
BUT DECIDED NOT TO TELL HIM...

00:20.151 --> 00:22.793
KEITH FEELS THAT IT WOULD BE
TOO DIFFICULT FOR EVERYONE.

00:22.793 --> 00:24.625
EASING HER GUILT WITH A CHECK.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.257
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
 OH, GOD!

00:26.257 --> 00:28.028
GABY'S OBSESSION
WITH HER DOLL...

00:28.028 --> 00:29.730
I GOTTA GET MY BABY!
 GET OUT!

00:29.730 --> 00:32.262
NEARLY COST HER LIFE.
 MY BABY!

00:32.262 --> 00:34.065
GABY! IT'S NOT GRACE!

00:34.065 --> 00:39.170
AND PAUL RECOGNIZED THE GUN
THAT WAS USED TO SHOOT HIM.

00:44.115 --> 00:49.080
(Mary Alice)
PAUL YOUNG HAD A SON.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.284
BUT HE HAD NOT SEEN ZACH
IN YEARS.

00:53.284 --> 00:58.359
HE HAD LOST HIM
TO A WORLD OF FAST WOMEN...

00:58.359 --> 01:01.832
EASY MONEY...

01:01.832 --> 01:04.765
AND HARD DRUGS.

01:06.137 --> 01:11.172
YES, PAUL HAD LOST HIS SON...

01:11.172 --> 01:14.375
BUT HE WAS DETERMINED
TO FIND HIM.

01:14.375 --> 01:18.109
AND HE WOULD DO ANYTHING...

01:18.109 --> 01:21.782
EVEN IF THAT MEANT
ASKING FOR HELP...

01:21.782 --> 01:25.116
FROM A MAN WHO DESPISED HIM.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.517
(dog barking in distance)

01:26.517 --> 01:28.088
(toolbox scrapes)

01:28.088 --> 01:30.391
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.263
I NEED A FAVOR.

01:32.263 --> 01:35.226
FROM ME?
 I KNOW. YOU HATE ME,
AND I HATE YOU.

01:35.226 --> 01:37.228
NOW THAT WE'RE DONE
WITH OUR TRADITIONAL GREETING,

01:37.228 --> 01:39.230
CAN I TELL YOU WHAT I WANT?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.731
YEAH, GO AHEAD.

01:40.731 --> 01:42.603
I NEED TO FIND ZACH.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.105
I WENT TO THAT MANSION
HIS GRANDFATHER LEFT HIM.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.309
IT'S IN FORECLOSURE.
 YEAH, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.841
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE WENT?

01:50.841 --> 01:55.146
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE IS.

01:55.146 --> 01:59.250
AND EVEN IF I DID, WHY WOULD
I DO YOU ANY FAVORS?

01:59.250 --> 02:01.892
ZACH'S THE ONE WHO SHOT ME.

02:05.296 --> 02:06.827
WHAT?

02:06.827 --> 02:09.660
THE POLICE SHOWED ME
THE GUN.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.264
IT WAS THE SAME ONE MARY ALICE
USED TO KILL HERSELF.

02:13.264 --> 02:14.705
AND ZACH KEPT IT?

02:14.705 --> 02:18.269
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
A STRANGE BOY.

02:18.269 --> 02:21.642
IF YOU REALLY THINK
HE TRIED TO KILL YOU,

02:21.642 --> 02:23.644
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL
THE POLICE?

02:23.644 --> 02:26.877
I'D LIKE TO KEEP THIS
IN THE FAMILY.

02:26.877 --> 02:29.550
SO AGAIN, WHERE IS HE?

02:29.550 --> 02:33.884
(sighs)
LAST I HEARD, IDAHO.

02:33.884 --> 02:36.827
WELL...

02:36.827 --> 02:38.929
IF YOU HEAR FROM HIM,

02:38.929 --> 02:41.392
TELL HIM I KNOW
WHAT HE DID...

02:41.392 --> 02:43.764
AND I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.401
THOUGH HE DIDN'T ADMIT IT,

02:50.401 --> 02:56.207
MIKE KNEW EXACTLY
WHERE ZACH WAS.

02:56.207 --> 02:58.549
(cell phone rings)

02:58.549 --> 03:01.612
BUT THE SON
PAUL YOUNG HAD LOST...

03:01.612 --> 03:02.883
(ringing)

03:02.883 --> 03:06.787
HAD NO INTEREST
IN BEING FOUND.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.289
(ringing stops)

03:23.834 --> 03:26.977
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHERE WE'RE GOING.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.884
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW QUICKLY
WE TRY TO GET THERE.

03:33.884 --> 03:38.889
IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT WE NEVER LOOK BACK.

03:38.889 --> 03:43.454
THE PAST WE LEFT BEHIND
WILL STILL FIND A WAY

03:43.454 --> 03:47.728
TO CATCH UP TO US.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.464
I'M MAKING GRILLED SALMON.
WHY DID YOU GET A PIZZA?

03:53.464 --> 03:56.267
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING
GRILLED SALMON.

03:56.267 --> 03:58.939
I WISH YOU WOULDN'T PUT
THAT TERRIBLE FOOD IN YOUR BODY.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.911
IT'S NOT GOOD FOR YOU.
 COME ON.

04:00.911 --> 04:03.344
YOU KNOW YOU WANT A BITE.
 UNH-UNH.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.876
AH. EAT IT. EAT IT.
 HMM.

04:05.876 --> 04:09.750
(chuckles)
 SERIOUSLY, I HAVE BETTER-TASTING
FOOD UNDER MY REFRIGERATOR.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.753
(telephone rings)

04:12.753 --> 04:13.924
(beep)
 HELLO?

04:13.924 --> 04:15.726
HI, BREE. IT'S AMBER.

04:15.726 --> 04:18.928
I'm sorry to bother you.
 OH. UH, NO BOTHER.

04:18.928 --> 04:21.031
LOOK, I'M OUTSIDE.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

04:21.031 --> 04:24.995
NO, UH, DON'T COME OVER.
I'LL, UM, COME TO YOU.

04:24.995 --> 04:26.967
SEE YOU SOON.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.569
(beep, receiver clatters)

04:28.569 --> 04:32.473
(sighs) I NEED TO RUN
TO LYNETTE'S FOR A MINUTE.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.975
DO YOU MIND WAITING FOR DINNER?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.977
(mouth full)
HURRY UP. I'M STARVED.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.979
(crunches)
 (door closes)

04:38.979 --> 04:41.852
HI.

04:41.852 --> 04:45.386
SO THE BANK SAYS YOUR CHECK IS
GONNA TAKE FIVE DAYS TO CLEAR.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.488
IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN
GET ME A CASHIER'S CHECK?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.890
I REALLY NEED
TO PAY SOME BILLS.
 ABSOLUTELY.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.022
UM, THERE'S A RESTAURANT
ACROSS FROM THE BANK.

04:52.022 --> 04:54.525
I CAN MEET YOU THERE
TOMORROW AT 2:00.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.927
THAT'LL BE GREAT.
THANK YOU AGAIN, BREE.

04:56.927 --> 04:59.299
BREE, WAIT.

05:01.802 --> 05:05.706
I KNOW KEITH DOESN'T
WANNA MEET CHARLIE.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.709
BUT HE SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW
WHAT HIS SON LOOKS LIKE.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.688
I'M SURE
HE'LL APPRECIATE THAT.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.024
SO ACCORDING
TO THE DONOR DATABASE,

05:24.024 --> 05:27.958
I WILL BE WAITING
THREE TO FOUR YEARS.

05:27.958 --> 05:30.931
WHERE DOES THAT PUT ME
ON THE LIST?

05:30.931 --> 05:33.834
I-I MEAN, IS THERE A NUMBER?
 THERE IS NO NUMBER.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.836
IT ALL BOILS DOWN
TO YOUR D.N.A.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.838
AND HOW LONG
YOU'VE BEEN WAITING.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.841
SO, YOU HAVE YOUR BEEPER.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.043
YEP.

05:43.043 --> 05:47.878
FOUR YEARS IS A LONG TIME.
(sighs)

05:50.881 --> 05:53.884
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A., telephone ringing)

05:56.787 --> 05:58.088
SUSAN BREMER?

05:58.088 --> 05:59.960
YEAH?

05:59.960 --> 06:03.694
MONROE CARTER.
FROM FAIRVIEW HIGH.

06:03.694 --> 06:05.966
I SAT BEHIND YOU
IN CHEM LAB.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.668
I WAS YEARBOOK PHOTOGRAPHER?

06:07.668 --> 06:10.501
NOW I SELL
PHARMACEUTICAL SUPPLIES.

06:10.501 --> 06:17.007
YOU KNOW, I FRIENDED YOU
ON FACEBOOK, LIKE, 12 TIMES.

06:17.007 --> 06:18.378
OH...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.681
I GUESS I DIDN'T GET THEM.

06:20.681 --> 06:24.154
NO WORRIES. TELL ME,
WHAT'S NEW? HOW ARE YOU?

06:24.154 --> 06:27.718
(voice breaking)
I NEED A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.020
I'M GONNA BE SPENDING
THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS

06:30.020 --> 06:33.864
ON DIALYSIS THREE TIMES A WEEK,
FIVE HOURS A DAY.

06:33.864 --> 06:35.596
(cries)

06:35.596 --> 06:38.799
WOW. I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.902
THEN AGAIN,
IF YOU'D FRIENDED ME...

06:41.902 --> 06:43.834
I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE REUNION...

06:43.834 --> 06:47.978
IF I'M STILL ALIVE.

06:50.641 --> 06:53.814
YOU LIKE?
FRANK GAVE THEM TO ME.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.716
WOW.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.689
THEY BELONGED
TO MY FIRST WIFE.
 (chuckles) SHE'S DEAD.

06:58.689 --> 07:01.492
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE...
WEIRD?

07:01.492 --> 07:04.655
HELL, NO. THIS NECKLACE BELONGED
TO HIS SECOND WIFE,

07:04.655 --> 07:06.657
AND SHE'S SITTING
RIGHT OVER THERE.

07:08.459 --> 07:10.130
THAT'S WEIRD.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.963
WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT, YOU TWO
SEEM VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.

07:12.963 --> 07:15.105
TELL HER ABOUT SATURDAY.

07:15.105 --> 07:19.610
WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?
 FRANK WANTS YOU TO BRING
TOM AND THE KIDS BACK UP HERE.

07:19.610 --> 07:21.912
I WANNA TAKE
A FAMILY PORTRAIT.

07:21.912 --> 07:24.114
FAMILY IS VERY IMPORTANT
TO FRANK.

07:24.114 --> 07:27.117
AND SINCE MY FIRST THREE
FAMILIES AREN'T SPEAKING TO ME,

07:27.117 --> 07:29.119
I WANNA GET THIS ONE RIGHT,

07:29.119 --> 07:31.852
SO I CAN RUB IT
IN THEIR MISERABLE FACES.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.084
OH, THAT'S A SWEET THOUGHT,

07:34.084 --> 07:36.557
BUT SATURDAYS
ARE KIND OF CRAZY FOR US.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.959
PENNY'S GOT BALLET, PARKER'S
STUDYING FOR THE S.A.T.s--

07:38.959 --> 07:41.461
WELL, HOW ABOUT
I MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.664
YOU'RE BRIBING ME?

07:43.664 --> 07:46.797
CALL IT GAS MONEY IF IT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER.

07:46.797 --> 07:50.140
WILL $500 DO IT?
 I'M NOT TAKING HIS MONEY.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.973
FRANK, I-ISN'T IT TIME
FOR YOUR HEART MEDICINE?

07:52.973 --> 07:55.946
LOOK HOW SHE
TAKES CARE OF ME. (chuckles)

07:55.946 --> 07:59.049
DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

07:59.049 --> 08:01.782
BUT I'M NOT GOING OVER A GRAND.

08:04.555 --> 08:06.557
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:06.557 --> 08:09.059
I JUST MARRIED THE MAN.
HE'S IN THE PROCESS

08:09.059 --> 08:12.062
OF REDOING HIS WILL,
SO WE'VE GOTTA PLAY BALL.

08:12.062 --> 08:14.064
NO. I AM NOT GONNA
BEND OVER BACKWARDS

08:14.064 --> 08:16.066
JUST TO PLEASE THAT JERK.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.569
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO MARRIED HIM, NOT ME.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.071
(sighs)
I CAN'T TELL FRANK NO.

08:21.071 --> 08:23.073
BUT I CAN TELL YOU NO.

08:23.073 --> 08:25.876
SO IF YOU WANT THE PICTURE,
YOU CAN COME TO OUR HOUSE.

08:25.876 --> 08:28.709
FINE. I'LL TALK TO HIM.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.981
AND WILL YOU STOP STARING
AT THIS NECKLACE, PHYLLIS?

08:30.981 --> 08:34.284
YOU ARE NOT GETTING IT BACK!

08:36.817 --> 08:39.119
SO THE FASHION SHOW ENDS,
AND YVES SAINT LAURENT--

08:39.119 --> 08:41.121
WHO DOESN'T SWIM,
BY THE WAY--

08:41.121 --> 08:44.655
RENTS A YACHT FOR
THE AFTER-PARTY. (chuckles)

08:44.655 --> 08:46.757
AND THAT'S WHERE
I MET MICK JAGGER.

08:46.757 --> 08:49.099
DO YOU HAVE ANY WINE?

08:49.099 --> 08:51.762
WE DON'T REALLY DO WINE
IN THERAPY.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.063
AH. WELL, YOU SHOULD.

08:53.063 --> 08:55.766
A FEW GLASSES, AND YOU'D HAVE
YOUR PATIENTS WHINING

08:55.766 --> 08:58.769
ABOUT HOW DADDY DIDN'T LOVE 'EM
IN HALF THE TIME.

08:58.769 --> 09:01.011
DID YOUR FATHER
NOT LOVE YOU?

09:01.011 --> 09:04.044
I WAS JOKING.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.946
MY DAD WAS GREAT.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.948
HE DIED WHEN I WAS A KID.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.080
WELL, THAT MUST HAVE
BEEN HARD....

09:10.080 --> 09:12.322
GROWING UP
WITHOUT A MALE PRESENCE?

09:12.322 --> 09:16.827
NO. SHE REMARRIED.

09:16.827 --> 09:18.058
OH, MY GOD.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.061
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU THE BEST
PART OF THE JAGGER STORY.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.733
HE READ MY PALM.

09:22.733 --> 09:25.035
AND HE TOLD ME I WOULD BE
GOING BELOW DECK

09:25.035 --> 09:26.737
TO HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

09:26.737 --> 09:28.999
NOT ONLY IS HE A GREAT SINGER,
HE'S AN AMAZING PSYCHIC.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.300
(giggles)

09:30.300 --> 09:34.144
GABY, WHY DON'T YOU LIKE
TALKING ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD?

09:34.144 --> 09:37.978
(sighs) WHAT'S THE POINT?
THE PAST IS THE PAST.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.811
WELL, SOMETIMES WHAT HAPPENS
TO US IN THE PAST

09:40.811 --> 09:43.253
AFFECTS WHO WE ARE TODAY.

09:43.253 --> 09:46.156
OH, BY THE WAY, JAGGER--
BIG CUDDLER.

09:46.156 --> 09:50.290
GABY, COME ON. WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO GO DEEPER HERE.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.293
WELL, THAT'S THE THING
ABOUT ME--THERE IS NO DEEPER.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.295
ASK ANY OF MY FRIENDS.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.728
I'M THE SHALLOWEST PERSON
THEY KNOW.

09:57.728 --> 10:00.030
I'M JUST SKIN, A LITTLE BLOOD,

10:00.030 --> 10:04.004
AND STORIES ABOUT KEITH RICHARDS
DRINKING OUT OF MY SHOES.

10:04.004 --> 10:08.338
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

10:08.338 --> 10:12.643
LET'S TALK
ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD.

10:14.985 --> 10:16.987
(door opens)

10:16.987 --> 10:18.288
(door closes)

10:18.288 --> 10:20.020
I LOVE THERAPY.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.653
REALLY?
 YEAH. IT'S LIKE A TALK SHOW,

10:22.653 --> 10:25.656
WHERE I'M THE GUEST
AND THE ONLY TOPIC IS ME.

10:25.656 --> 10:28.699
SO IT'S HELPING? YOU TALKED
TO HER ABOUT THE DOLL?
 YA-BUP-BUP-BUP-BUP!

10:28.699 --> 10:31.031
THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL.
FIRST RULE OF THERAPY.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.704
ACTUALLY, FIRST RULE
OF THERAPY IS NO WINE,

10:33.704 --> 10:35.706
BUT I'M GONNA CHANGE THAT.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.769
I'M SO GLAD THIS IS WORKING.
I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.041
(chuckles) IT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I NEEDED.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.073
IN FACT, I'M GONNA BE GOING
THREE TIMES A WEEK--

10:43.073 --> 10:45.275
MONDAYS, THURSDAYS,
AND FRIDAYS.

10:45.275 --> 10:48.218
WOW, THAT'S A LOT.
 WELL, IT WAS YOUR IDEA.

10:48.218 --> 10:50.220
(chuckles)
OH, BY THE WAY, UH,

10:50.220 --> 10:52.723
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE OVER
MY CARPOOLS ON MONDAYS.

10:52.723 --> 10:54.254
THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

10:54.254 --> 10:56.927
SURE. I GUESS I COULD
MOVE SOME THINGS AROUND.

10:58.929 --> 11:01.131
OH! AND NO GOLF
ON THURSDAYS,

11:01.131 --> 11:03.433
BECAUSE YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE
JUANITA TO BALLET.

11:03.433 --> 11:06.196
GABY, I DO BUSINESS
ON THE LINKS.

11:06.196 --> 11:09.399
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET BETTER OR NOT?

11:09.399 --> 11:11.241
OKAY.

11:11.241 --> 11:13.673
OKAY. I WILL CANCEL GOLF.

11:15.275 --> 11:19.049
OH, AND ON FRIDAY, I HAVE
A GYNECOLOGIST APPOINTMENT.
 GABY!

11:19.049 --> 11:23.213
THAT I NEED YOU TO CANCEL.
(laughs)

11:23.213 --> 11:26.286
WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT,
THOUGH?

11:33.824 --> 11:37.968
(indistinct conversations,
silverware clattering)

11:37.968 --> 11:39.299
HI.
 (Amber) HI.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.701
I SEE YOU BROUGHT CHARLIE.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.134
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE
ANYONE TO WATCH HIM.

11:44.134 --> 11:47.077
UH, I HAVE
YOUR CASHIER'S CHECK.
 THANK YOU AGAIN, BREE.

11:47.077 --> 11:51.211
HONEY, LET'S GO.
 NO. I HAVEN'T FINISHED
MY PIZZA.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.784
LET'S GO.
 NO!

11:53.784 --> 11:56.716
LISTEN, BREE, DO YOU MIND
KEEPING AN EYE ON HIM?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.118
THE BANK IS
RIGHT ACROSS THE WAY.

11:58.118 --> 11:59.449
I'LL ONLY BE TEN MINUTES.
 I DON'T KNOW. I-I--

11:59.449 --> 12:02.753
JUST ORDER SOME PIZZA.
IT'LL BE ON ME.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.930
(chuckles nervously)
SO, CHARLIE...

12:09.930 --> 12:12.462
I'M GONNA PLAY GAMES.

12:12.462 --> 12:14.464
RIGHT.

12:14.464 --> 12:17.167
MUCH BETTER THAN CONVERSATION.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.169
(elevator bell dings)

12:19.169 --> 12:22.442
OH. MR. LYNWOOD.
 SUSAN.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.816
MY BEEPER WENT OFF.
DOES THAT MEAN--
 YES, WE FOUND YOU A DONOR.

12:25.816 --> 12:27.818
(squeals) OH!

12:27.818 --> 12:30.350
OH, BUT HOW? I MEAN, YOU SAID
IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE YEARS.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.253
WELL, THE RULES CHANGE IF
SOMEONE WANTS TO DONATE A KIDNEY

12:33.253 --> 12:35.185
TO A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.

12:35.185 --> 12:38.158
WAIT. UH...
THIS IS SOMEONE I KNOW?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.189
APPARENTLY.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.892
HE'S IN MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW
SIGNING THE PAPERWORK.

12:41.892 --> 12:44.064
IT'S A HE?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.997
I'M GETTING A MAN KIDNEY?

12:46.997 --> 12:50.240
NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING.

12:54.244 --> 12:55.545
OH, MY GOD.

12:55.545 --> 12:58.348
HEY, SUSAN.

12:58.348 --> 13:01.411
MONROE. YOU'RE MY DONOR?

13:01.411 --> 13:05.315
YEAH. TURNS OUT I'M A MATCH.
I MEAN, WHAT ARE THE ODDS, HUH?

13:05.315 --> 13:08.018
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

13:08.018 --> 13:10.020
WELL, I'M GIVING YOU
A VITAL ORGAN.

13:10.020 --> 13:12.192
HOW ABOUT "THANK YOU"?

13:12.192 --> 13:14.825
(sighs)
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

13:14.825 --> 13:18.068
W-WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER
IN YEARS, AND...

13:18.068 --> 13:19.569
I BARELY REMEMBERED YOU.

13:19.569 --> 13:21.431
I REMEMBERED YOU.

13:21.431 --> 13:24.374
YOU WERE REALLY WONDERFUL
TO ME IN HIGH SCHOOL.

13:24.374 --> 13:26.176
AND YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,

13:26.176 --> 13:27.878
AND I WANNA HELP.

13:27.878 --> 13:30.510
WOW.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.583
WELL... THANK YOU.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.516
SO WHAT'S A GUY GOTTA DO
TO GET A HUG?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.218
GIVE YOU A LUNG?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.921
OH, COME HERE, YOU!
(laughs)

13:40.921 --> 13:43.453
OH, PLEASE KNOW
YOU'VE MADE ME VERY HAPPY.

13:43.453 --> 13:46.356
I'M SO GLAD.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.532
(indistinct conversations)

13:52.532 --> 13:54.604
(thud)

13:54.604 --> 13:57.607
(machine beeping)

13:57.607 --> 13:58.969
BUSTED.

13:58.969 --> 14:01.912
I'M ON MY WAY
TO MRS. GOODMAN'S PLACE

14:01.912 --> 14:04.144
TO FINISH THAT JOB,
AND WHAT DO I SEE?

14:04.144 --> 14:07.577
YOUR CAR, PARKED IN FRONT
OF A PIZZA JOINT.
 YEAH, ABOUT THAT--

14:07.577 --> 14:09.279
ADMIT IT.
YOU'RE HOOKED.

14:09.279 --> 14:12.482
WHAT ARE YOU, A DEEP-DISH GIRL?
THIN CRUST?

14:12.482 --> 14:17.057
YEP. YOU GOT ME.
I AM A CLOSET PIZZA LOVER.

14:17.057 --> 14:19.859
MYSTERY SOLVED.
YOU CAN GO TO YOUR JOB NOW.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.193
I NEED MORE QUARTERS.

14:23.193 --> 14:27.137
WHO'S THIS? WHAT DO YOU GOT,
SOME SECRET BOYFRIEND?

14:27.137 --> 14:29.940
(laughs)
THIS IS, UM, CHARLIE.

14:29.940 --> 14:32.172
I'M, UH, WATCHING, UH, HIM
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE.

14:32.172 --> 14:34.304
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CHANGE.

14:34.304 --> 14:37.007
NOW, COULD YOU EXCUSE US?
 YOU GOT QUARTERS?

14:37.007 --> 14:39.049
(coins jingle)

14:39.049 --> 14:41.311
I GOT SOME.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.183
COME ON.

14:44.314 --> 14:46.116
WHAT ABOUT MRS. GOODMAN?

14:46.116 --> 14:48.118
SHE'S LIVED WITHOUT
A SCREEN DOOR FOR 30 YEARS.

14:48.118 --> 14:50.190
SHE CAN WAIT
ANOTHER HALF HOUR.

14:50.190 --> 14:54.224
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

14:54.224 --> 14:56.896
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
THIS IS A SECRET, ALL RIGHT?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.469
BUT THIS IS JUST BETWEEN
YOU AND ME. HAND...

14:59.469 --> 15:03.233
IN THE COOKIE JAR.
BANG. LET'S SEE IT.

15:03.233 --> 15:05.976
HEY! HIGH FIVE.

15:05.976 --> 15:08.979
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
LET'S SEE IT AGAIN. ONE MORE.

15:08.979 --> 15:09.980
(ball thudding)

15:09.980 --> 15:13.113
UH-HUH.
STEP-BACK JUMPER FADEAWAY.

15:13.113 --> 15:16.086
NICE ONE.

15:18.148 --> 15:23.553
ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME?
ONE MORE, I'M CALLING THE NBA.

15:23.553 --> 15:25.555
(laughs) THAT WAS AWESOME.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.098
DID YOU SEE THAT?
THREE IN A ROW.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.630
I CERTAINLY DID.
IT WAS WONDERFUL.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.233
CHARLIE, I GOTTA TAKE OFF.
NICE MEETING YOU.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.205
SEE YOU LATER.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.538
BYE!

15:38.538 --> 15:41.241
BYE. REMEMBER ME
WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LAKERS.

15:47.277 --> 15:50.981
(mumbles) OKAY...

15:50.981 --> 15:53.223
(vehicle approaches)

15:53.223 --> 15:54.684
(singsongy) THEY'RE HERE!
(chuckles)

15:54.684 --> 15:58.058
(normal voice)
WHOA. FRANK DRIVES A BENTLEY.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.331
OF COURSE HE DOES.

16:01.331 --> 16:04.034
WHY ARE WE TAKING
THIS STUPID PICTURE?

16:04.034 --> 16:06.336
I MEAN, WE BARELY
EVEN KNOW THE GUY.

16:06.336 --> 16:08.198
WE'RE DOING IT FOR YOUR GRANDMA.

16:08.198 --> 16:11.241
AND THE LOVELY MAN
SHE JUST MARRIED.

16:11.241 --> 16:14.144
HELLO! WELCOME!

16:14.144 --> 16:16.706
HELLO, EVERYBODY!
 (Preston and Parker)
HEY, GRANDMA.

16:16.706 --> 16:19.149
SO, THIS REALLY IS
WHERE THEY LIVE.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.351
I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDIN'.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.715
HOW WAS THE DRIVE OVER,
FRANK?

16:25.715 --> 16:27.317
IT TOOK FOREVER.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.989
WE GOT BEHIND
THIS ASIAN WOMAN DRIVER--

16:29.989 --> 16:34.224
SLOW AS SOY SAUCE
GOING UPHILL IN WINTER.

16:34.224 --> 16:37.627
OKAY. SMALL TALK'S OVER.
LET'S TAKE THE PICTURE.

16:37.627 --> 16:41.371
WE WERE ALL THINKING
WE'D SIT OVER HERE.
 NO, I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOUR CRAPPY KITCHEN

16:41.371 --> 16:43.073
IN THE BACKGROUND THERE.

16:43.073 --> 16:46.376
LET'S MOVE THIS SOFA OVER THERE.
I WANT IT TO BE REAL HOMEY.

16:46.376 --> 16:49.609
CAGNEY AND LACEY,
GRAB THIS END OF THE COUCH.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.612
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.245
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK
INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES

16:55.245 --> 16:59.189
AND MOVE FURNITURE AROUND.
 WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE THIS,
YOU CAN.

16:59.189 --> 17:02.252
UH--NO, NO, NO. PUT IT BACK.
 (thud)

17:02.252 --> 17:05.255
IT'S BAD ENOUGH YOU MAKE ME
DRIVE ALL THE WAY OUT HERE

17:05.255 --> 17:07.257
TO EAST PODUNK. WELL, BULL!

17:07.257 --> 17:09.628
I WANT MY PICTURE,
MY WAY!

17:09.628 --> 17:12.531
(grunts)
 (grunts)

17:12.531 --> 17:15.105
HEY!

17:17.567 --> 17:20.270
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

17:20.270 --> 17:21.271
(grunts)

17:21.271 --> 17:24.374
FRANK, THAT'S TOO HEAVY.
YOU'RE ALL RED.

17:24.374 --> 17:27.277
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE THE GIRLS
HERE WERE NOT MUCH HELP.

17:27.277 --> 17:31.581
OKAY, EVERYONE. COME AND TAKE
YOUR PLACE AROUND...

17:31.581 --> 17:33.183
GRANDPA FRANK.

17:35.425 --> 17:38.128
OKAY.

17:38.128 --> 17:39.289
HERE WE GO.

17:39.289 --> 17:41.261
(beeps)

17:41.261 --> 17:44.664
EVERYBODY SMILE
AND SAY "BENTLEY."

17:44.664 --> 17:46.266
(all) BENTLEY.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.767
(rapid beeping, shutter clicks)

17:47.767 --> 17:50.440
OKAY. NOBODY MOVE. I WANNA
CHECK THAT IT'S GOOD.

17:50.440 --> 17:53.603
OOH. HANG ON.

17:53.603 --> 17:56.646
WE HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.
FRANK, YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.480
FRANK?

18:00.480 --> 18:03.453
FRANK?

18:03.453 --> 18:05.215
OH, NO.

18:05.215 --> 18:06.486
WHAT'S WRONG?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.788
HE'S DEAD.

18:10.220 --> 18:14.824
OF COURSE HE IS.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.204
THERE'S NO PULSE.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.276
NO PULSE.
HE'S DEFINITELY DEAD.

18:26.276 --> 18:29.339
IS HIS GHOST GONNA BE
TRAPPED IN OUR HOUSE?

18:29.339 --> 18:31.341
IS HE GONNA HAUNT US?

18:31.341 --> 18:33.643
NO, HONEY. OF COURSE NOT.

18:33.643 --> 18:34.884
RIGHT?

18:36.786 --> 18:39.789
GROSS. A DEAD GUY'S
ON OUR COUCH.
 AND I'M HAVING FRIENDS OVER.

18:39.789 --> 18:42.152
HOW LONG TILL HE STARTS
TO SMELL?

18:42.152 --> 18:44.354
KIDS, GO UPSTAIRS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

18:44.354 --> 18:47.857
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? THERE'S A DEAD BODY.

18:47.857 --> 18:51.701
THAT'S TOTALLY SOMETHING TO SEE.
 OKAY, KIDS. COME ON.
LET'S GO. UPSTAIRS.

18:51.701 --> 18:54.334
COME ON.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.871
MOM, I'M SO SORRY.

19:03.313 --> 19:07.417
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S GONE.
JUST LIKE THAT.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.679
I KNOW. I KNOW.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.852
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:12.852 --> 19:14.854
(beeping)
 UH, I'M CALLING THE POLICE

19:14.854 --> 19:17.287
SO THEY CAN GET
A CORONER OVER HERE.

19:17.287 --> 19:19.929
UH, HANG ON.
Y-YOU CAN'T CALL THEM YET.

19:19.929 --> 19:21.291
(beep)
 WHY NOT?

19:21.291 --> 19:23.733
THAT NEW WILL
I TOLD YOU ABOUT--

19:23.733 --> 19:26.496
THE ONE LEAVING EVERYTHING
TO ME?

19:26.496 --> 19:28.538
IT DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT
UNTIL TOMORROW.

19:32.242 --> 19:35.205
OH, NO.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.377
NO, NO.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.409
YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP HIM HERE?

19:39.409 --> 19:40.950
LIKE THAT? ALL NIGHT?

19:40.950 --> 19:43.453
IF WE CALL THE CORONER NOW,

19:43.453 --> 19:45.285
I GET NOTHING.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.618
IF WE CALL IN THE MORNING...
MILLIONS.

19:48.618 --> 19:51.761
I DIDN'T WANT FRANK IN MY HOUSE
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

19:51.761 --> 19:54.264
NOW YOU WANT ME
TO HANG OUT WITH HIS CORPSE?

19:54.264 --> 19:56.266
WELL,
THEN THROW A SHEET OVER HIM

19:56.266 --> 19:58.268
AND SPRAY A LITTLE
AIR FRESHENER.

19:58.268 --> 20:01.371
YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE. FRANK
WANTED ME TO HAVE THAT MONEY.

20:01.371 --> 20:03.303
NO! I-IT'S TOO WEIRD!
 (beeps)

20:03.303 --> 20:08.438
Y-YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME ANYMORE.

20:08.438 --> 20:12.612
IN FACT, I COULD EVEN
TAKE CARE OF YOU.

20:12.612 --> 20:17.587
COLLEGE TUITION?
BRACES?

20:17.587 --> 20:19.589
IT WOULD MAKE ME FEEL
SO GOOD

20:19.589 --> 20:24.694
TO BE ABLE TO HELP YOU
FOR A CHANGE.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.002
(Mike's voice)
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, SON.

20:33.002 --> 20:35.635
(Zach's voice) YEAH, I GUESS.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.337
HOW'S IT GOING?

20:37.337 --> 20:38.638
I COULDN'T BE BETTER.

20:38.638 --> 20:42.942
WHAT, UH, CAN I DO FOR YA?
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.575
LET ME GUESS.
YOU WANT MONEY.

20:45.575 --> 20:49.379
I NAILED IT, DIDN'T I?
UH, BUT YOU CAN SEE,

20:49.379 --> 20:52.822
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE--
THEY... THEY GOT HERE FIRST.

20:52.822 --> 20:55.825
WELL, SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

20:55.825 --> 21:00.830
WHO CARES? WAS TIME TO DOWNSIZE,
MINIMIZE MY CARBON FOOTPRINT.

21:00.830 --> 21:03.333
YOU FEELING OKAY, BUDDY?

21:03.333 --> 21:04.794
I FEEL GREAT.

21:04.794 --> 21:07.337
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
THE ONE HAVING PROBLEMS.

21:07.337 --> 21:11.441
WELL, SUSAN AND I ARE GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH TIME,

21:11.441 --> 21:13.443
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

21:13.443 --> 21:16.576
SO HOW SCREWED ARE YOU?

21:16.576 --> 21:19.278
WE HAD TO RENT OUT
OUR HOUSE...

21:19.278 --> 21:21.551
TO YOUR FATHER, IN FACT.

21:21.551 --> 21:23.052
(chuckles)

21:23.052 --> 21:25.315
MY FATHER'S IN PRISON.

21:25.315 --> 21:27.357
HE'S OUT.

21:27.357 --> 21:29.459
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

21:31.321 --> 21:34.524
NO.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.870
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?
 I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

21:40.870 --> 21:44.434
THAT BASTARD GETS TO WALK FREE
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HE DID!

21:44.434 --> 21:47.437
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU.
 IT'S--IT'S OKAY. JUST...

21:47.437 --> 21:51.711
COULD YOU LEAVE? I-I-I-I NEED
TO BE ALONE. JUST...

22:08.858 --> 22:10.560
(deep voice) TOM...

22:10.560 --> 22:13.433
(high-pitched scream) YOU NEVER
SNEAK UP BEHIND SOMEONE

22:13.433 --> 22:15.435
WHEN THEY'RE STARING
AT A DEAD PERSON!

22:15.435 --> 22:17.767
(sighs) JEEZ.

22:17.767 --> 22:21.771
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST...
(chuckles) YOUR SCREAM...

22:21.771 --> 22:24.774
IT WAS LIKE ALL THE TESTOSTERONE
LEFT YOUR BODY AT ONCE.

22:24.774 --> 22:27.817
(sighs) THIS WHOLE THING
CREEPS ME OUT.

22:27.817 --> 22:30.119
MM. IT'S JUST...

22:30.119 --> 22:31.821
A BODY.

22:31.821 --> 22:33.122
(sighs)

22:33.122 --> 22:35.625
HOW DO YOU BECOME THIS GUY?

22:35.625 --> 22:37.356
9 KIDS, 14 GRANDCHILDREN,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.859
AND YOU NEVER TALK
TO ANY OF THEM.

22:39.859 --> 22:43.793
THAT'S THE TRICKY THING
ABOUT MONEY.

22:43.793 --> 22:45.765
CHANGES PEOPLE.

22:45.765 --> 22:49.098
CHANGES RELATIONSHIPS.

22:49.098 --> 22:51.601
IT SURE DOES.

22:51.601 --> 22:54.373
AND AFTER YOU'RE DEAD,
WHAT'S IT ALL MEAN?

22:56.806 --> 22:58.107
(yells)

22:58.107 --> 23:00.109
(high-pitched scream)

23:01.881 --> 23:04.584
NOT FUNNY.

23:06.055 --> 23:07.557
(telephone rings)

23:07.557 --> 23:09.058
(click, beep)

23:09.058 --> 23:10.560
HELLO.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.563
(woman) Hi. This is Maria.
I'm just calling to confirm

23:13.563 --> 23:15.565
Gabrielle Solis
for her 1:00 appointment.

23:15.565 --> 23:17.567
YEP. SHE'S ON HER WAY.

23:17.567 --> 23:19.569
Terrific.
You wouldn't happen to know

23:19.569 --> 23:22.071
what kind of treatment
she wants today, do you?

23:22.071 --> 23:23.573
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

23:23.573 --> 23:26.075
WHATEVER YOU'VE BEEN DOING
SEEMS TO BE WORKING. (chuckles)

23:26.075 --> 23:28.578
Well, on Monday
she got the seaweed wrap,

23:28.578 --> 23:31.581
Wednesday the hot stone massage.
We just want to make sure

23:31.581 --> 23:34.083
she takes full advantage
of our entire spa menu.

23:34.083 --> 23:37.987
OH, SHE IS TAKING
FULL ADVANTAGE, ALL RIGHT.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.421
(New Age music playing)

23:42.421 --> 23:44.724
(door opens)
 OH, GOOD, SANDRO.
THERE YOU ARE.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.426
I THINK WE SHOULD START
ON MY SHOULDERS TODAY.

23:47.426 --> 23:48.728
(inhales deeply)

23:48.728 --> 23:52.031
MM. (sighs) THAT'S GOOD.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.034
(grunts) MAYBE A LITTLE
LIGHTER ON THE PRESSURE.

23:55.034 --> 23:59.038
NO, NO. LIGHTER.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.611
(strained voice) OKAY, MAYBE
LET'S NOT DO THE SHOULDERS.

24:01.611 --> 24:04.474
OKAY.
HOW ABOUT THE GLUTES?

24:04.474 --> 24:06.476
(screams)

24:06.476 --> 24:08.147
CARLOS?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:08.147 --> 24:11.651
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERAPY.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.153
THIS IS THERAPY!
DIDN'T YOU SEE THE SIGN?

24:14.153 --> 24:16.055
"MASSAGE THERAPY,"
"AROMATHERAPY."

24:16.055 --> 24:18.057
I TALKED TO DR. WYNER.
SHE SAID THAT

24:18.057 --> 24:20.189
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN BACK SINCE
THE FIRST SESSION. WHY NOT?

24:20.189 --> 24:23.192
WELL... (sighs) I JUST
DON'T THINK I REALLY NEED IT.

24:23.192 --> 24:25.194
I MEAN,
THIS IS REALLY HELPING.

24:25.194 --> 24:28.838
NO. THIS IS
IGNORING THE PROBLEM.

24:28.838 --> 24:31.541
(scoffs) YOU KNOW,
THE WAY YOU SAY "PROBLEM,"

24:31.541 --> 24:34.203
YOU MAKE IT SEEM A WHOLE LOT
WORSE THAN IT ACTUALLY IS.

24:34.203 --> 24:37.476
GABY, YOU ALMOST GOT US KILLED
PULLING A DOLL OUT OF THE CAR.

24:39.549 --> 24:42.051
(sighs) FINE.
IF IT'LL GET YOU OFF MY ASS,

24:42.051 --> 24:44.854
I'LL MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR NEXT WEEK.

24:44.854 --> 24:47.857
NOW GET YOUR CLOTHES ON.
WE'RE LEAVING.

24:47.857 --> 24:51.490
(scoffs)
GOD, NOW I'M SO TENSE.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.492
I'LL GIVE YOU 100 BUCKS

24:53.492 --> 24:56.495
IF YOU WORK ON MY SHOULDERS
FOR TEN MINUTES. AAH!

24:56.495 --> 24:58.998
THAT'S FOR FREE. LET'S GO.

25:01.070 --> 25:04.073
HE--HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS JUST
AFTER MIDNIGHT TO WATCH SOME TV,

25:04.073 --> 25:06.576
AND WE DIDN'T FIND HIM
UNTIL THIS MORNING.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.077
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

25:08.077 --> 25:10.580
I'LL JUST PUT DOWN
TIME OF DEATH AROUND 3:00 A.M.

25:10.580 --> 25:12.081
WOULD YOU LIKE US

25:12.081 --> 25:14.584
TO BRING THE BODY
DIRECTLY TO THE FUNERAL HOME?

25:14.584 --> 25:16.085
YES, THANK YOU.

25:16.085 --> 25:18.718
AGAIN, MA'AM,
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

25:22.552 --> 25:26.225
OH, MY GOD. I'M RICH!

25:26.225 --> 25:29.699
AGAIN, MA'AM,
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

25:29.699 --> 25:31.200
OH, I KNOW.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.203
I SPENT SOME OF THE BEST WEEKS
OF MY LIFE WITH FRANK.

25:34.203 --> 25:37.206
BUT HE'S GONE, THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT,

25:37.206 --> 25:39.238
AND I AM A MILLIONAIRE.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.711
GOOD. YOU CAN
BUY ME A NEW COUCH.

25:41.711 --> 25:44.073
I'LL BUY YOU
WHATEVER YOU WANT.
 OH, I WAS KIDDING.

25:44.073 --> 25:46.245
WELL, I WASN'T.
WHAT DO YOU NEED? ANYONE.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.247
I NEED A LAPTOP FOR SCHOOL.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.950
DONE.
 CAN I HAVE A MOTORCYCLE?

25:50.950 --> 25:52.952
FOR SCHOOL?
 KIDS, KNOCK IT OFF.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.785
FRANK'S BODY'S
NOT EVEN IN THE VAN YET.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.987
ACTUALLY, IT IS.

25:57.987 --> 26:01.060
I DON'T CARE. WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT MONEY RIGHT NOW.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.133
A MAN DIED--
NOT A BANK ACCOUNT--A MAN.

26:04.133 --> 26:07.236
LET'S SHOW A LITTLE RESPECT.

26:10.640 --> 26:13.973
WE SHOULD PROBABLY FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT BENTLEY.

26:27.757 --> 26:29.258
(door closes)

26:29.258 --> 26:30.760
ZACH?

26:30.760 --> 26:32.722
ANYBODY HERE?

26:35.164 --> 26:37.226
WHOA, ZACH. ZACH, IT'S ME!

26:37.226 --> 26:38.728
(panting)

26:38.728 --> 26:40.229
SORRY. IT'S, UH...

26:40.229 --> 26:42.732
IT'S A ROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:42.732 --> 26:45.705
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.707
SO... TWO VISITS
IN ONE YEAR.

26:47.707 --> 26:50.109
WHAT'S UP?

26:50.109 --> 26:53.342
HEY, WOULD YOU MIND, UH,
SITTING DOWN? WE NEED TO TALK.

26:53.342 --> 26:55.044
DO WE?

26:55.044 --> 26:58.788
SURE... JUST... A MINUTE.

26:58.788 --> 27:01.350
WHO YOU LOOKING FOR, ZACH?
YOUR FATHER?

27:01.350 --> 27:04.353
PAUL CAME TO SEE ME.

27:04.353 --> 27:07.126
HE THINKS YOU SHOT HIM.
THAT TRUE?

27:07.126 --> 27:09.128
(sniffs)

27:13.362 --> 27:15.334
OKAY. I SHOT HIM.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.008
HE RUINED MY LIFE,
BUT HE GETS TO START HIS OVER.

27:19.008 --> 27:21.110
IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.

27:21.110 --> 27:23.673
OH, GOD.

27:23.673 --> 27:25.675
IT WAS EASY.
I PRACTICED IT

27:25.675 --> 27:30.950
IN MY HEAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
AND THEN... BAM! SHOWTIME.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.722
BUT THEN I GOT ALL PARANOID

27:32.722 --> 27:35.725
AND I DUMPED THE STUPID GUN AT
BREE'S. I MEAN, I DON'T--I DON'T

27:35.725 --> 27:38.187
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING WITH
THAT ONE. I WASN'T THINKING.

27:38.187 --> 27:40.690
YEAH. THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH BEING HIGH.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.092
YOU DO THINGS
WITHOUT THINKING.

27:43.092 --> 27:46.195
WHAT? I'M NOT USING DRUGS.

27:49.368 --> 27:52.902
ZACH. I'VE BEEN THERE.

27:52.902 --> 27:56.405
YOU NEED HELP. NOW WE GOT
TO GET YOU INTO REHAB.

27:56.405 --> 27:59.408
YOU WANT TO SEND ME TO REHAB?
SO WHAT, SO MY FATHER CAN COME

27:59.408 --> 28:04.353
AND FIND ME AND TAKE ME
TO PRISON? NO WAY.
 I JUST WANT TO
GET YOU SOME HELP.

28:04.353 --> 28:08.157
IT'S TOO LATE FOR YOU
TO PRETEND TO BE MY FATHER.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.
BUT I STILL CARE.

28:08.157 --> 28:10.820
THEN WHY DID YOU LET ME GO
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

28:10.820 --> 28:14.293
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO LET ME GET
RAISED BY THAT MONSTER.
 NO, THAT'S NOT
HOW THINGS HAPPENED.

28:14.293 --> 28:16.465
I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE.
 LET ME HELP YOU--

28:16.465 --> 28:20.399
JUST GET OUT MY HOUSE, ALL
RIGHT? JUST GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

28:33.342 --> 28:37.016
IT'S REALLY NICE OF YOU
TO HAVE ME OVER.

28:37.016 --> 28:40.019
(scoffs) ARE YOU KIDDING?
I AM GONNA BE SPENDING THE REST

28:40.019 --> 28:43.022
OF MY LIFE THINKING OF WAYS
TO THANK YOU. BUT AS A START...

28:43.022 --> 28:44.323
OH. REALLY?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.324
MM.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.326
OH, COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S...

28:47.326 --> 28:48.327
(chuckles)

28:48.327 --> 28:50.329
OH, WOW.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.331
THAT IS SO SWEET.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.733
A CRYSTAL HEART.

28:54.733 --> 28:58.007
I LOOKED FOR A CRYSTAL KIDNEY--
SURPRISINGLY HARD TO FIND.

28:58.007 --> 28:59.308
YOU KNOW, IN HIGH SCHOOL

28:59.308 --> 29:02.041
I ALWAYS DREAMT
YOU'D GIVE ME YOUR HEART.

29:02.041 --> 29:04.343
(both laugh)

29:04.343 --> 29:06.345
YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF HIGH SCHOOL,

29:06.345 --> 29:09.348
I, UH, HAVE A PRESENT
FOR YOU, TOO.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.321
IN ADDITION TO THE ONE THAT'S
BEING RIPPED OUT OF YOUR BODY?

29:14.423 --> 29:17.486
I'M SORRY. THAT--
THAT WAS A LITTLE TOO VIVID.

29:17.486 --> 29:19.188
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

29:19.188 --> 29:21.190
HERE, UH... HERE YOU GO.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.392
OH... WHAT IS THIS?

29:23.392 --> 29:27.236
IT'S JUST SOME MEMORABILIA
THAT I'D THOUGHT YOU'D ENJOY.
 OH.

29:27.236 --> 29:30.239
SOME PHOTOS I TOOK THAT DIDN'T
MAKE THE CUT FOR THE YEARBOOK.

29:30.239 --> 29:31.540
OH. (gasps)

29:31.540 --> 29:33.542
OH, MY GOD.

29:33.542 --> 29:36.245
THERE I AM
ON THE FIELD HOCKEY TEAM...

29:36.245 --> 29:38.247
AND IN "PIPPIN."

29:38.247 --> 29:41.250
(chuckles) THESE ARE GREAT.
WHO ELSE DO YOU HAVE IN HERE?

29:41.250 --> 29:42.551
WELL...

29:42.551 --> 29:45.254
OH, THERE'S ME
ON THE DEBATE CLUB...

29:45.254 --> 29:48.557
AND ME
AT THE SPRING FORMAL...

29:48.557 --> 29:50.559
ME IN A BATHING SUIT...

29:50.559 --> 29:52.561
TAKEN THROUGH A FENCE.

29:52.561 --> 29:54.393
NOT EASY TO GET.

29:54.393 --> 29:58.567
THOSE BUSHES AROUND YOUR YARD
WERE REALLY THICK.

29:58.567 --> 30:00.269
OH...

30:00.269 --> 30:02.271
WOW.

30:02.271 --> 30:05.804
IS THIS ONE
OF MY OLD ENGLISH PAPERS?

30:05.804 --> 30:10.039
YEAH. YOU THREW IT AWAY, AND I
FISHED IT OUT OF THE GARBAGE.

30:10.039 --> 30:14.313
THAT'S ALSO WHERE
I FOUND THIS. UH....

30:14.313 --> 30:15.985
HERE.

30:15.985 --> 30:17.286
(stammers)

30:17.286 --> 30:19.148
MY RETAINER?

30:19.148 --> 30:22.151
I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT, BUT I
WAS TOO SCARED TO TALK TO YOU.

30:22.151 --> 30:24.453
ISN'T IT FUNNY
HOW WE'RE TALKING NOW?

30:24.453 --> 30:26.255
YEAH, REALLY FUNNY.

30:26.255 --> 30:27.556
(both chuckle)

30:27.556 --> 30:29.258
(sighs) AND NOW...

30:29.258 --> 30:31.260
WE'RE GONNA BE BONDED...

30:31.260 --> 30:33.562
YOU KNOW... FOREVER.

30:33.562 --> 30:35.264
(chuckles nervously)

30:35.264 --> 30:38.267
(sighs) YOU KNOW, IF YOU
TOLD ME BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL

30:38.267 --> 30:41.270
THAT ONE DAY MY KIDNEY WOULD BE
CLEANSING SUSAN BREMER'S BLOOD,

30:41.270 --> 30:43.572
I WOULD HAVE BEEN
THE HAPPIEST GUY ON EARTH.

30:43.572 --> 30:48.077
WELL, I'M GLAD I COULD
MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR YOU.

30:48.077 --> 30:51.150
(chuckles nervously)

30:51.150 --> 30:53.452
(door opens)

30:53.452 --> 30:56.325
OH.

30:56.325 --> 30:57.626
OH, MY.

30:57.626 --> 31:01.130
HERE. WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE
WHAT'S SHAKING AT THE MALT SHOP?

31:01.130 --> 31:03.893
WOW. THANKS, GRANDMA.

31:03.893 --> 31:07.336
HEY. WHAT'S ALL THIS?

31:07.336 --> 31:10.339
A LITTLE THANK YOU
FOR ALL THE HELP YOU'VE BEEN

31:10.339 --> 31:13.372
THE LAST FEW DAYS.
OPEN IT, OPEN IT.

31:13.372 --> 31:17.376
(gasps)
WOW, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

31:17.376 --> 31:20.980
MM-HMM. 2,200 BUCKS.
DIDN'T BAT AN EYE.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.482
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.484
OH, THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.187
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
AND THE WHOLE FAM-DAMILY

31:28.187 --> 31:31.020
COME TO MY HOUSE
FOR DINNER SUNDAY NIGHT?

31:31.020 --> 31:33.022
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
COMING HERE SUNDAY NIGHT.

31:33.022 --> 31:36.025
I WAS GONNA SEND ONE OF
THE KIDS TO PICK YOU UP.

31:36.025 --> 31:38.897
NAH. I THINK IT'S BETTER
YOU COME TO ME.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.370
OH, BUT SUNDAY'S A SCHOOL NIGHT,
AND TOM'S GOT

31:41.370 --> 31:44.303
AN EARLY MEETING MONDAY MORNING.
HOW ABOUT SATURDAY?

31:44.303 --> 31:46.305
NAH. SUNDAY.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.337
OH, HEADS UP--

31:48.337 --> 31:51.340
DINNERS AT THE CENTER ARE FANCY.
YOU'LL HAVE TO SQUEEZE

31:51.340 --> 31:54.383
THOSE BOYS OF YOURS
INTO SOME JACKETS AND TIES.

31:54.383 --> 31:56.515
BUT, MOM... MOM... MOM!

31:56.515 --> 32:00.249
ARE YOU NOT LISTENING?
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK FOR US.

32:00.249 --> 32:03.322
I WOULD THINK YOU WOULD WANT
TO MAKE IT WORK, LYNETTE...

32:03.322 --> 32:06.155
GIVEN EVERYTHING I'M GONNA
BE DOING FOR THE FAMILY.

32:06.155 --> 32:07.456
(scoffs)

32:07.456 --> 32:10.459
ARE YOU BLACKMAILING ME?

32:10.459 --> 32:14.003
NO! I'M INVITING YOU
TO DINNER.

32:14.003 --> 32:19.338
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT,
I CAN ASK ONE OF YOUR SISTERS.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.213
(door closes)

32:25.714 --> 32:28.717
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, COVER YOUR MAN. COME ON.

32:28.717 --> 32:30.419
(man calling football game
play-by-play on TV)

32:30.419 --> 32:31.720
(groans)

32:31.720 --> 32:33.682
...BROUGHT DOWN BY
THE STRONG SAFETY MITCHELL...

32:33.682 --> 32:35.384
(sighs)
 PICKS UP 17 YARDS...

32:35.384 --> 32:37.686
HEY, BABE.
GAME'S ALMOST OVER.

32:37.686 --> 32:39.688
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

32:39.688 --> 32:41.690
...WHICH LEFT REED ISOLATED
ON THE LINEBACKER. NOW...

32:41.690 --> 32:43.692
(sighs)

32:43.692 --> 32:46.565
...EASY THROW, EASY CATCH.
ONE MORE RENEGADE FIRST DOWN...

32:46.565 --> 32:48.267
(sighs)

32:48.267 --> 32:50.599
(crowd cheering)

32:50.599 --> 32:53.342
YOU OKAY?

32:53.342 --> 32:55.144
(click)

32:55.144 --> 32:58.477
I'M SORRY. I SHOULD HAVE
GIVEN THIS TO YOU BEFORE.

33:02.511 --> 33:04.513
WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME
A PICTURE

33:04.513 --> 33:06.515
OF THE KID
FROM THE PIZZA PLACE?

33:08.387 --> 33:11.360
(whispers) HE'S YOUR SON.

33:23.172 --> 33:24.703
(clink)
 I STILL CAN'T GET OVER THIS.

33:24.703 --> 33:27.376
YOU RUN INTO SOME RANDOM
CLASSMATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL,

33:27.376 --> 33:29.678
AND HE'S GONNA END UP
SAVING YOUR LIFE?

33:29.678 --> 33:31.680
HERE'S THE PART
I CAN'T GET OVER.

33:31.680 --> 33:33.682
YOU NEVER PUT OUT
FOR THIS GUY?

33:33.682 --> 33:36.385
NO. NO, I BARELY REMEMBER HIM.
MONROE IS JUST DOING

33:36.385 --> 33:39.348
THIS INCREDIBLY SELFLESS
ACT OF CHARITY. IT'S INSPIRING.

33:39.348 --> 33:41.050
WHAT'S THIS?

33:41.050 --> 33:43.052
UH... N-NOTHING.
JUST PUT THAT AWAY.

33:43.052 --> 33:45.354
IT'S GOT YOUR NAME
ON THE COVER IN GLITTER.

33:45.354 --> 33:46.725
(chuckles)

33:46.725 --> 33:49.728
NO, IT'S JUST A GIFT FROM
MONROE. CAN I PLEASE HAVE THAT?

33:49.728 --> 33:51.430
(gasps)

33:51.430 --> 33:52.431
(sighs)

33:52.431 --> 33:54.263
OH, MY GOD.

33:54.263 --> 33:58.267
YEAH. YOU USED TO BE CUTE.
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:58.267 --> 34:00.769
NO, THERE'S, LIKE, A MILLION
PICTURES OF YOU IN HERE.

34:00.769 --> 34:04.173
I GUESS HE HAD
A LITTLE CRUSH ON ME.

34:04.173 --> 34:06.815
CRUSH? NO, SUSAN. THIS MONROE
GUY'S OBSESSED WITH YOU.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.447
THIS IS A SHRINE.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.449
IT IS NOT.
 IT IS. I KNOW. I'VE MADE THEM.
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT ALLOWED

34:11.449 --> 34:14.822
TO MAIL THINGS
TO RYAN SEACREST ANYMORE.
 IT'S CREEPY. IT'S LIKE
THE PART OF THE MOVIE

34:14.822 --> 34:17.826
WHEN THEY GO TO THE GUY'S
BASEMENT AND FIND THE CANDLES

34:17.826 --> 34:21.159
IN FRONT OF THE PICTURE
OF THE WOMAN HE'S GONNA KILL.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.732
YOU KNOW... THOSE GUYS
ARE OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD.

34:23.732 --> 34:26.565
AND YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A KIDNEY FROM THIS MAN?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.266
OKAY, I ADMIT,

34:28.266 --> 34:31.699
I-I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED,
AND, YES, HE MAY BE 5% STALKER.

34:31.699 --> 34:34.103
IS THIS A LOCK OF YOUR HAIR?

34:34.103 --> 34:36.804
10% STALKER.

34:36.804 --> 34:41.550
BUT IF I DON'T TAKE HIS KIDNEY,
I COULD WAIT ANOTHER SIX YEARS.

34:41.550 --> 34:43.552
WHY SHOULDN'T I DO IT?

34:43.552 --> 34:46.255
BECAUSE YOU'LL BE
FOREVER CONNECTED TO HIM.

34:46.255 --> 34:49.257
YOU'LL NEVER GET RID OF HIM.
 AND I HAVE A FEELING

34:49.257 --> 34:52.460
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY ORGAN
HE WANTS TO... SHARE WITH YOU.

34:55.524 --> 34:57.796
CARLOS, CAN YOU
FEEL MY FOREHEAD?
 NO.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.499
I THINK I HAVE A FEVER.
 YOU'RE FINE.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.871
YOU DIDN'T EVEN FEEL!
 'CAUSE I DON'T NEED TO.
LIAR.

35:02.871 --> 35:04.873
NO, I'M REALLY SICK.
LET'S RESCHEDULE.

35:04.873 --> 35:06.835
I SHOULDN'T SEE
THE THERAPIST TODAY.

35:06.835 --> 35:08.437
WE'RE GOING IN.

35:08.437 --> 35:11.240
WHAT IF I NEED
TO THROW UP?
 IT'S A THERAPIST'S OFFICE.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.882
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
GET IT ALL OUT.
 CARLOS--

35:13.882 --> 35:17.316
YOU ARE GOING TO THERAPY,
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

35:17.316 --> 35:19.618
FINE. CAN I AT LEAST GO
TO THE BATHROOM FIRST?

35:19.618 --> 35:23.152
YOU KNOW I HAVE A BLADDER
THE SIZE OF A DIME.

35:31.160 --> 35:35.234
(thud, splash)

35:35.234 --> 35:37.466
(gasps)

35:37.466 --> 35:38.767
(grunts)

35:38.767 --> 35:40.539
(sighs)

35:44.273 --> 35:45.674
(grunts)

35:47.776 --> 35:51.620
(grunting)

35:51.620 --> 35:53.652
(window squeaking)

35:53.652 --> 35:55.824
(grunts)

35:55.824 --> 35:57.356
(sighs)

35:57.356 --> 35:59.428
AAH! (sighs)

35:59.428 --> 36:02.631
HOW MANY YEARS
HAVE WE BEEN MARRIED?
 TOO MANY, IF YOU ASK ME!

36:02.631 --> 36:04.663
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?
 I'M GOING HOME.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.896
NO. GABY, YOU ARE SICK.
YOU NEED HELP.

36:07.896 --> 36:10.399
LOOK, YOU WANT ME TAKE PILLS,
I WILL TAKE THEM.

36:10.399 --> 36:13.402
YOU WANT ME TO SEE A HYPNOTIST?
BRING HIM TO THE HOUSE.

36:13.402 --> 36:16.405
HELL, I'LL EVEN LET YOU HIRE
A PRIEST TO DO AN EXORCISM.

36:16.405 --> 36:19.548
BUT WHAT I AM NOT GOING TO DO
IS TALK TO THAT WOMAN IN THERE.

36:19.548 --> 36:21.510
WHY NOT?

36:21.510 --> 36:24.413
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO
TALK ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD!
 OH.

36:26.715 --> 36:29.418
CAN I SAY ONE THING?

36:31.590 --> 36:34.593
YOU DID FIND A WAY TO TALK
ABOUT IT BEFORE... WITH ME.

36:34.593 --> 36:37.296
JUST THAT ONCE.
WE HAD GOTTEN MARRIED.

36:37.296 --> 36:39.598
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A RIGHT TO KNOW.

36:39.598 --> 36:42.601
AND YOU SAID THAT YOU NEVER
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN,

36:42.601 --> 36:44.303
AND I HAVE RESPECTED THAT.

36:44.303 --> 36:47.306
BUT OVER THE YEARS,
I HAVE SEEN WHAT IT COSTS YOU.

36:47.306 --> 36:49.608
THE NIGHTS I HEAR YOU
CRYING IN THE BATHROOM...

36:49.608 --> 36:53.211
SAD LOOK ON YOUR FACE WHEN
PEOPLE ASK ABOUT YOUR PAST...

36:53.211 --> 36:55.984
YOU THINK THAT YOU'VE LEFT IT
BEHIND, BUT YOU HAVEN'T, GABY.

36:55.984 --> 36:58.747
YOU CARRY THAT BURDEN
AROUND WITH YOU.

36:58.747 --> 37:01.490
I JUST WANT YOU
TO CONSIDER THE IDEA THAT

37:01.490 --> 37:07.556
THIS THERAPIST MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU LET ALL THAT GO.

37:11.330 --> 37:15.464
(voice breaks)
CAN YOU COME WITH ME?

37:17.806 --> 37:20.008
SO WHEN I LOST GRACE,

37:20.008 --> 37:24.573
IT TAPPED INTO THIS NEED
I HAVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN.

37:24.573 --> 37:28.577
WHERE DO YOU THINK
THIS NEED CAME FROM?

37:28.577 --> 37:30.279
(breathes deeply)

37:37.486 --> 37:40.258
'CAUSE NO ONE PROTECTED ME.

37:42.791 --> 37:47.436
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY STEPFATHER MOLESTED ME.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.483
(brakes squeal)

38:04.483 --> 38:06.615
GET IN.

38:06.615 --> 38:08.457
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

38:08.457 --> 38:11.289
I KNOW WHERE ZACH IS.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.522
(hose thuds)

38:15.524 --> 38:18.066
ARE WE DRIVING TO IDAHO?

38:18.066 --> 38:22.070
LOOK, THE REASON I DIDN'T
TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS BEFORE

38:22.070 --> 38:25.073
IS I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO TO HIM.

38:25.073 --> 38:26.575
BUT WHATEVER IT IS,

38:26.575 --> 38:29.578
IT CAN'T BE WORSE THAN
WHAT HE'S DOING TO HIMSELF.

38:29.578 --> 38:33.442
AND WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THAT
AFTER HE TRIED TO KILL ME?

38:33.442 --> 38:35.444
HE'S YOUR SON.

38:35.444 --> 38:38.447
HE'S MY SON.

38:38.447 --> 38:41.550
HE NEEDS OUR HELP.

38:43.622 --> 38:44.923
(sighs)

38:53.932 --> 38:55.934
(sighs)

38:55.934 --> 38:59.337
HEY, NEIGHBOR.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.410
MONROE. UH...
(chuckles)

39:01.410 --> 39:04.012
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NEIGHBOR"?

39:04.012 --> 39:06.515
WELL, UH, YOUR LANDLADY'S
SHOWING ME AN APARTMENT.

39:06.515 --> 39:09.518
I FIGURED NOW THAT WE'RE BACK
IN EACH OTHER'S LIVES,

39:09.518 --> 39:12.581
IT WOULD BE BETTER
IF I LIVED CLOSE.

39:12.581 --> 39:14.583
YEAH, UH...

39:14.583 --> 39:16.585
HERE'S THE THING
ABOUT THAT.

39:16.585 --> 39:19.087
THERE'S CLOSE...

39:19.087 --> 39:21.660
AND THEN THERE'S
GLENN CLOSE.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.931
HUH?

39:22.931 --> 39:24.933
THIS FEELS A LITTLE...

39:24.933 --> 39:27.636
STALKY.

39:27.636 --> 39:29.938
STALKY?

39:29.938 --> 39:32.941
I-I'M GIVING YOU A KIDNEY.

39:32.941 --> 39:34.643
(sighs)

39:34.643 --> 39:37.005
MONROE, COME WITH ME.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.550
THE OTHER DAY,
WHEN YOU WERE OVER HERE,

39:41.550 --> 39:44.983
I DID NOT GIVE YOU
THE FULL STORY.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.485
(sighs)

39:48.487 --> 39:49.988
THIS IS MIKE.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.990
HE IS MY HUSBAND.

39:51.990 --> 39:55.393
AND THIS IS OUR SON M.J.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.627
OKAY. WHY ARE YOU
SHOWING ME THIS?

39:58.627 --> 40:00.929
BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO SEE THAT

40:00.929 --> 40:04.503
THERE ISN'T ROOM FOR ANYONE ELSE
IN THAT PICTURE.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.004
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.607
(frame clatters)

40:08.607 --> 40:11.610
I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME A KIDNEY.

40:11.610 --> 40:16.114
BUT ONCE THE OPERATION IS OVER,
THAT HAS TO BE IT.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.517
WHY?

40:18.517 --> 40:19.748
BECAUSE...

40:19.748 --> 40:24.022
YOU WANT TO BE MORE THAN
FRIENDS, AND I'M MARRIED.

40:25.894 --> 40:27.596
OH.

40:27.596 --> 40:29.598
THE TRICKY PART IS THAT...

40:29.598 --> 40:31.800
I STILL NEED A KIDNEY...

40:31.800 --> 40:34.763
'CAUSE I WANT
TO STAY HEALTHY FOR...

40:34.763 --> 40:39.107
THE TWO SPECIAL GUYS
IN THAT PICTURE.

40:39.107 --> 40:41.109
SO IF YOU...

40:41.109 --> 40:44.543
STILL WANT TO
GIVE ME ONE...

40:44.543 --> 40:46.715
NO STRINGS ATTACHED,

40:46.715 --> 40:49.748
I WILL BE HONORED
TO TAKE IT...

40:49.748 --> 40:54.052
AND YOU WILL HAVE
MY ETERNAL GRATITUDE.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.886
YEAH, BUT THAT'S ALL
I'LL HAVE.

40:57.886 --> 41:01.490
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

41:06.565 --> 41:10.539
I CAN'T.

41:10.539 --> 41:12.541
I, UH...

41:14.543 --> 41:17.546
(voice breaking) I THOUGHT
IF I DID THIS, THEN...

41:17.546 --> 41:19.107
YOU WOULD FINALLY...

41:19.107 --> 41:21.680
I-I KNOW.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.782
I KNOW.

41:23.782 --> 41:27.556
I-I'M SO SORRY.

41:27.556 --> 41:29.818
DON'T BE.

41:29.818 --> 41:32.490
I'LL BE FINE.

41:32.490 --> 41:36.725
(sighs) ALL RIGHT. I GUESS...
I'LL--I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

41:41.670 --> 41:42.971
(sniffles)

41:42.971 --> 41:45.774
ACTUALLY, I GUESS I WON'T.

41:50.839 --> 41:55.213
WE MAY THINK
WE'VE LEFT THE PAST BEHIND,

41:55.213 --> 41:57.846
BUT IT HAS A WAY...

41:57.846 --> 42:00.989
OF CATCHING UP TO US.

42:00.989 --> 42:06.094
♪♪♪

42:06.094 --> 42:08.627
THOUGH WE WANT TO RUN AWAY,

42:08.627 --> 42:12.561
WE ARE FORCED
TO CONFRONT OUR PAST...

42:15.133 --> 42:18.707
AND THE SECRETS
THAT IT BURIED...

42:18.707 --> 42:21.039
MUST COME INTO THE LIGHT.

42:23.071 --> 42:26.575
AND THEN, IF WE ARE STRONG,

42:26.575 --> 42:29.147
WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE ON.

42:33.752 --> 42:38.256
YES, WE ALL NEED
TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND

42:38.256 --> 42:41.129
AND MOVE ON TOWARD THE FUTURE.

42:41.129 --> 42:44.593
AND IF WE'RE LUCKY,

42:44.593 --> 42:48.737
WE WILL HAVE HELP
GETTING THERE.
