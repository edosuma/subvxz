WEBVTT

00:01.961 --> 00:04.087
(June) EVERY RELATIONSHIP HAS

00:01.961 --> 00:04.087
ITS OWN DYNAMIC.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.047
FOR EXAMPLE, MY MOM AND I STILL

00:04.129 --> 00:06.047
LIKE TO TALK EVERY NIGHT

00:06.089 --> 00:07.424
BEFORE BED.

00:07.466 --> 00:10.427
And then the dog found

00:07.466 --> 00:10.427
my other gardening clog.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.137
And that's everything

00:10.469 --> 00:12.137
that happened to me today.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.055
And the day's

00:12.179 --> 00:14.055
not over yet.

00:14.097 --> 00:16.266
Let's put on some Lyle Lovett

00:14.097 --> 00:16.266
and get horizontal.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.059
Mmm.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.102
OKAY, BYE.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.061
EW.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.063
(laughs)

00:22.105 --> 00:23.983
BUT I DON'T THINK

00:22.105 --> 00:23.983
I WILL EVER UNDERSTAND

00:24.023 --> 00:25.442
CHLOE AND JAMES' DYNAMIC.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.902
GOOD THING YOUR FACE WAS

00:25.484 --> 00:26.902
SO OILY TONIGHT.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.278
I COULD CHECK MY MAKEUP

00:26.944 --> 00:28.278
IN YOUR FOREHEAD.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.655
I WISH YOU HAD.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.655
YOU LOOK LIKE A RUNNER-UP

00:29.697 --> 00:31.323
AT A CHILD'S BEAUTY PAGEANT

00:29.697 --> 00:31.323
IN OHIO.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.074
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK

00:31.365 --> 00:33.074
FROM THE DOUCHIE AWARDS

00:33.116 --> 00:34.743
AND YOU WON FIVE DOUCHIES.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.078
ONLY AWARD YOU COULD EVER WIN IS

00:34.785 --> 00:37.078
FOR LETTING RAPPERS TOUCH YOU.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.497
I DON'T GET HOW YOU GUYS

00:37.120 --> 00:38.497
TALK TO EACH OTHER LIKE THAT.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.333
IT'S SO MEAN,

00:38.539 --> 00:41.333
ESPECIALLY BEFORE BEDTIME.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.084
IT'S NOT MEAN. IT'S JUST US.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.963
AND WHAT I DON'T GET IS

00:43.126 --> 00:45.963
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE WEARING.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.089
OH. THEY'RE MY MIDWEST

00:46.005 --> 00:48.089
BREAKFAST PAJAMAS.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.089
(pours liquor)

00:48.131 --> 00:49.383
I'VE HAD THEM

00:48.131 --> 00:49.383
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

00:49.424 --> 00:51.092
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:51.134 --> 00:54.095
YOU WERE A GROWN MAN PRETENDING

00:51.134 --> 00:54.095
TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL ON TV.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.764
WATCHING ME PRETEND

00:54.137 --> 00:55.764
TO BE IN HIGH SCHOOL ON TV

00:55.806 --> 00:58.141
WAS AS CLOSE TO HIGH SCHOOL

00:55.806 --> 00:58.141
AS YOU EVER GOT.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.518
YOU ARE AGITATING ME.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.896
I'M GONNA NEED A SECOND CUP

00:59.560 --> 01:01.896
OF CHAMOMILE TO GO TO SLEEP.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.105
OOH. PUT SOME OF THESE

01:01.937 --> 01:04.105
IN THERE.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.273
YOU'LL SLEEP LIKE

01:04.147 --> 01:05.273
YOU'RE DEAD.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.026
(pills rattle)

01:07.067 --> 01:09.194

01:20.163 --> 01:21.623
LOOK AT THIS BACKPACK

01:20.163 --> 01:21.623
I FOUND ON THE SUBWAY.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.166
I THINK IT BELONGS

01:21.665 --> 01:23.166
TO A LITTLE KID,

01:23.208 --> 01:26.127
BUT IT'S STILL GOT GOOD STUFF

01:23.208 --> 01:26.127
IN IT.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.128
(camera shutter clicks)

01:27.170 --> 01:29.506
SORRY. JUST TAKING

01:27.170 --> 01:29.506
A SELF-PORTRAIT FOR MY ART SHOW.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.549
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.133
THIS SIDE,

01:32.175 --> 01:33.176
THIS SIDE,

01:33.218 --> 01:36.179
OR NAKED?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.015
ART SHOW?

01:38.057 --> 01:40.308
YEP. IT'S CALLED

01:38.057 --> 01:40.308
"DIFFERENT BUTTER VIOLATIONS."

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
OOH. HOW ARE YOU GONNA

01:40.350 --> 01:42.143
VIOLATE BUTTER?

01:42.185 --> 01:45.230
I HOPE YOU SMACK AROUND SOME

01:42.185 --> 01:45.230
MARGARINE. I HATE MARGARINE.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.148
ACTUALLY, I'M RECREATING

01:45.272 --> 01:47.148
SOME BUTTER VIOLATIONS

01:47.190 --> 01:50.151
THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED OVER

01:47.190 --> 01:50.151
THE YEARS AS A HEALTH INSPECTOR.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.236
YOU GUYS'LL BE THERE,

01:50.193 --> 01:51.236
RIGHT?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.030
OF COURSE, ELI.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.030
WE WOULDN'T MISS--

01:53.072 --> 01:54.197
IS THERE GONNA BE WINE?

01:53.072 --> 01:54.197
LIKE, GOOD WINE?

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
LIKE, WINE I COULD DRINK

01:54.239 --> 01:55.532
THIS FAST?

01:55.574 --> 01:57.993
(slurping quickly)

01:58.035 --> 01:59.160
(cell phone rings)

01:59.202 --> 02:00.161
(beep)

02:00.203 --> 02:02.163
HELLO. IS JAMES THERE?

02:02.205 --> 02:03.791
(clippers buzzing)

02:02.205 --> 02:03.791
UH... HEY.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
UH, GOOD NEWS. BRUNCH WITH EMILY

02:03.832 --> 02:06.209
TOMORROW IS STILL ON.

02:06.251 --> 02:07.669
ARE YOU SURE?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.379
YOU HAVEN'T LOST INTEREST

02:07.711 --> 02:09.379
SINCE WE TALKED THIS MORNING?

02:09.421 --> 02:11.214
NO. ISN'T THAT GREAT? I CAN'T

02:09.421 --> 02:11.214
WAIT FOR YOU TO MEET HER.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.383
SHE'S REALLY SMART,

02:11.256 --> 02:13.383
POSITIVE ATTITUDE,

02:13.425 --> 02:15.176
GREAT BREASTS.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.177
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.638
ACTUALLY, "GREAT BREASTS" BEFORE

02:16.219 --> 02:17.638
"POSITIVE ATTITUDE."

02:17.679 --> 02:19.431
YOU--YOU SHOULD FLIP THOSE

02:17.679 --> 02:19.431
IN YOUR MIND.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.849
HOW'S MY FADE COMING?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.350
THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:20.891 --> 02:22.350
YOUR HAIRCUT'S CALLED.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.895
WELL, I'M EXCITED

02:22.392 --> 02:24.895
TO MEET EMILY.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.229
I WON'T ROCK

02:24.937 --> 02:26.229
ANYTHING TOO SLUTTY

02:26.271 --> 02:27.564
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT

02:26.271 --> 02:27.564
TO INTIMIDATE HER.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.816
BUT I DO WANNA WEAR

02:27.606 --> 02:28.816
MY NEW PUSH-UP BRA,

02:28.857 --> 02:30.818
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO

02:28.857 --> 02:30.818
FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.694
(beep)

02:30.859 --> 02:32.694
I CAN'T BELIEVE

02:32.736 --> 02:35.196
JAMES HAS BEEN SEEING

02:32.736 --> 02:35.196
THE SAME GIRL FOR A MONTH.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.698
IT'S SO SWEET

02:35.238 --> 02:36.698
THAT HE LIKES HER ENOUGH

02:36.740 --> 02:38.492
THAT HE WANTS

02:36.740 --> 02:38.492
TO INTRODUCE HER TO US.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.201
IT'S LIKE WE'RE HIS PARENTS.

02:40.243 --> 02:41.829
OR HIS FRIENDS, JUNE.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.538
OR JUST HIS FRIENDS.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.878
OH, I KNOW THIS PLACE.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.878
I RAN OUT ON A CHECK HERE ONCE.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.421
BUT IT'S OKAY.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.421
I WAS WEARING A WIG.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.216
HEY. THANK YOU FOR COMING.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.886
THIS IS THE LOVELY EMILY.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.886
(chuckles)

02:57.928 --> 02:59.471
YOU MUST BE CHLOE.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.471
IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE TO--

02:59.513 --> 03:01.056
VETO.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.017
OHH. I'M SORRY.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.017
WE HAVE TO BREAK UP.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.602
THIS WAS FUN, THOUGH.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.312
W--I DON'T--

03:05.644 --> 03:07.312
I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I--

03:07.354 --> 03:10.231
JAMES AND I HAVE VETO POWER OVER

03:07.354 --> 03:10.231
WHOEVER THE OTHER ONE DATES.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.233
YEAH, IF ONE OF US YELLS "VETO,"

03:10.273 --> 03:12.233
THE OTHER ONE HAS TO HONOR IT

03:12.275 --> 03:13.861
AND END THE RELATIONSHIP

03:12.275 --> 03:13.861
IMMEDIATELY.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.071
YOU'RE SAYING THAT LIKE

03:13.902 --> 03:16.071
IT'S A THING, AND IT IS NOT.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.531
IT IS A THING. IT'S OUR THING.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.531
WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOREVER.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.450
EVER SINCE CHLOE WANTED TO DATE

03:17.572 --> 03:20.450
NASCAR CHAMPION JEFF GORDON.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.243
(stock car engines roaring)

03:20.492 --> 03:22.243
VETO.

03:22.285 --> 03:24.121
WHAT?!

03:22.285 --> 03:24.121
VETO!

03:24.163 --> 03:26.247
WHAT?!

03:24.163 --> 03:26.247
VE--

03:26.289 --> 03:27.457
(crowd cheering)

03:27.499 --> 03:29.835
VETO!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.963
BUT JEFF GORDON IS A CELEBRITY,

03:29.877 --> 03:32.963
SO YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.506
BYE FOREVER.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.507
UH...

03:35.549 --> 03:37.258
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, THOUGH.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.886
COME BACK HERE SOMETIME

03:37.300 --> 03:38.886
AND TRY THE CINNAMON BUNS.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.261
THEY'RE AMAZING.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.769
HOW COULD YOU VETO EMILY

03:46.309 --> 03:47.769
SO QUICKLY?

03:47.811 --> 03:49.270
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.439
I DIDN'T NEED TO.

03:49.312 --> 03:51.439
IT'S LIKE A SPECIAL POWER.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.942
SOME PEOPLE HAVE SPECIAL POWERS

03:51.481 --> 03:53.942
WHERE THEY CAN'T SEE,

03:53.984 --> 03:56.277
AND SOME PEOPLE HAVE SPECIAL

03:53.984 --> 03:56.277
POWERS WHERE THEY CAN'T HEAR.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.654
THOSE ARE

03:56.319 --> 03:57.654
BLIND AND DEAF PEOPLE.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.156
THEY'RE ACTUALLY

03:57.696 --> 03:59.156
LACKING POWERS.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.156
(horse whinnies)

03:59.198 --> 04:00.365
MY SPECIAL POWER IS,

04:00.407 --> 04:02.993
I KNOW WHEN JAMES' RELATIONSHIPS

04:00.407 --> 04:02.993
ARE GOING TO END BADLY.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.286
I DON'T KNOW HOW I DO IT,

04:03.035 --> 04:05.286
BUT I TAKE ONE LOOK AT THE GIRL

04:05.328 --> 04:07.372
AND IT'S LIKE

04:05.328 --> 04:07.372
I "BEAUTIFUL MIND" IT.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.957
AND TRUST ME,

04:07.414 --> 04:08.957
IF HE KEPT GOING OUT WITH HER,

04:08.999 --> 04:11.292
HE'D BECOME

04:08.999 --> 04:11.292
SOFT AND COMPLACENT.

04:11.334 --> 04:14.295
THAT POOR GIRL. YOU VETOED HER

04:11.334 --> 04:14.295
RIGHT TO HER FACE.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.380
SHE DIDN'T EVEN

04:14.337 --> 04:15.380
GET ANY BREAD.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.548
JUNE, IF YOU'RE NOT

04:16.590 --> 04:17.799
BEING COMPLETELY HONEST

04:16.590 --> 04:17.799
WITH YOUR FRIENDS,

04:17.841 --> 04:19.176
THEN YOU'RE NOT HELPING THEM

04:19.218 --> 04:21.469
BE THE BEST THAT

04:19.218 --> 04:21.469
THEY CAN POSSIBLY BE.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.804
BY THE WAY,

04:22.846 --> 04:24.098
YOU'RE USING THE WRONG

04:22.846 --> 04:24.098
FOUNDATION FOR YOUR SKIN TONE.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.390
IT ACTUALLY CLASHES

04:24.139 --> 04:25.390
WITH YOUR SKIN TONE.

04:25.432 --> 04:30.187
IT'S LIKE YOUR FACE IS ONE GIRL,

04:25.432 --> 04:30.187
AND YOUR NECK IS ANOTHER.

04:30.229 --> 04:32.397
I JUST BOUGHT A WHOLE TUB

04:30.229 --> 04:32.397
OF THIS STUFF!

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
I DON'T KNOW. I ALMOST THINK

04:35.358 --> 04:37.318
TOO BIG IS WORSE THAN TOO SMALL.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.029
I KNOW.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.029
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A GUY.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.363
BUT TRUST ME,

04:39.071 --> 04:40.363
IF YOU'RE A WOMAN,

04:40.405 --> 04:42.616
SMALL JUST MAKES YOUR NOSE

04:40.405 --> 04:42.616
LOOK GIANT.

04:42.657 --> 04:44.118
ARE YOU GUYS STILL TALKING

04:42.657 --> 04:44.118
ABOUT PENISES?

04:44.159 --> 04:45.368
NO, WE'VE MOVED ON

04:44.159 --> 04:45.368
TO SUNGLASSES.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.370
DID WE?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.580
OH. SPECIAL K IS CALLING.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.124
SHE JUST GOT BACK FROM THAILAND.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.124
I GOTTA GO.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.708
OOH, SPEC--

04:50.165 --> 04:51.708
(beep)

04:51.750 --> 04:53.418
WHAT UP, BITCH?

04:53.460 --> 04:56.130
(gasps) SHUT UP, BITCH.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.380
I AM IN, BITCH.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.423
(beep)

04:57.422 --> 04:58.423
OOH!

04:58.465 --> 05:01.176
SPECIAL K JUST TOLD ME

04:58.465 --> 05:01.176
ABOUT A PARTY

05:01.218 --> 05:02.343
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

05:01.218 --> 05:02.343
WHERE SPIKE LEE IS ANGRY.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
JAMES HAS BEEN DYING

05:02.385 --> 05:03.804
TO WORK WITH HIM.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.806
WE'VE GOTTA GO.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.433
OH, MY GOD! I LOVE HIM!

05:05.847 --> 05:08.433
THIS IS GONNA BE SO MUCH FUN!

05:08.475 --> 05:10.769
I MEMORIZED EVERY WORD

05:08.475 --> 05:10.769
OF "DO THE RIGHT THING."

05:10.811 --> 05:12.646
PLEASE RECITE IT TO ME

05:10.811 --> 05:12.646
WHILE I DO MY HAIR.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.356
(hip-hop music playing)

05:12.687 --> 05:15.356
"LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT

05:12.687 --> 05:15.356
THE RIGHT HAND, LEFT HAND.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.358
"IT IS A TALE

05:15.398 --> 05:17.358
OF GOOD AND EVIL.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.570
HATE--IT IS WITH THIS HAND

05:17.400 --> 05:20.570
THAT CANE ICED HIS BROTHER."

05:22.030 --> 05:24.365
GRAB YOUR LEAST ANNOYING FEDORA,

05:22.030 --> 05:24.365
JAMES!

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
WE'RE...

05:24.407 --> 05:26.367
GOING TO SEE SPIKE.

05:26.409 --> 05:28.369
CHLOE. I CAN EXPLAIN.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.371
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.371
I VETOED HER.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.999
YEAH, I, UH...

05:32.040 --> 05:33.374
(pauses DVR)

05:33.416 --> 05:34.501
I DIDN'T END UP DOING THAT.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.338
HI, EMILY. I'M JUNE.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.338
WE MET AT BRUNCH.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.260
"NORBIT"!

05:43.302 --> 05:45.053
I HATED THIS MOVIE

05:43.302 --> 05:45.053
UNTIL I REALIZED

05:45.095 --> 05:47.014
THAT'S  EDDIE MURPHY,

05:45.095 --> 05:47.014
THAT  IS EDDIE MURPHY...

05:47.055 --> 05:50.017
AND GUESS WHAT?

05:47.055 --> 05:50.017
THAT  IS EDDIE MURPHY.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.351
(door slams)

05:58.441 --> 06:01.402
OH, MY GOD.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.402
YOU'RE CLOTHED UNDER THERE.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.822
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU GUYS

06:01.444 --> 06:03.822
TIME TO TALK?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.407
I'LL GO STAND IN THE...

06:03.864 --> 06:06.407
DINING ROOM.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.575
(forced laugh)

06:06.449 --> 06:07.575
WON'T BE AWKWARD

06:07.617 --> 06:10.037
THAT I CAN SEE YOU,

06:07.617 --> 06:10.037
AND YOU CAN SEE ME.

06:10.078 --> 06:11.038
TALK.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.413
I...

06:12.455 --> 06:13.414
(laughs)

06:13.456 --> 06:14.916
I-I-I DON'T KNOW

06:13.456 --> 06:14.916
WHAT TO SAY.

06:14.958 --> 06:17.919
SHE LIKES ME FOR ME,

06:14.958 --> 06:17.919
NOT THE GUY ON TV. RIGHT, EM?

06:17.961 --> 06:20.214
OH, IT'S TRUE. I DIDN'T EVEN

06:17.961 --> 06:20.214
KNOW HE WAS ON A SHOW.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.924
UGH, VETO!

06:20.255 --> 06:22.924
I VETO YOUR FACE.

06:22.966 --> 06:24.425
CHLOE, IT'S DONE.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
YOU CAN'T JUST OVERRIDE

06:24.467 --> 06:26.469
THE VETO.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.889
OR  CAN  HE?

06:28.930 --> 06:31.683
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

06:28.930 --> 06:31.683
JAMES HASN'T HONORED THE VETO.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.683
(gasps)

06:31.725 --> 06:33.060
(camera shutter clicks)

06:31.725 --> 06:33.060
UGH!

06:33.101 --> 06:35.354
LUTHER!

06:33.101 --> 06:35.354
SORRY, JAMES. I COULDN'T RESIST.

06:35.394 --> 06:38.232
CHLOE'S SHOCK-SNAPPED ME

06:35.394 --> 06:38.232
SO MANY TIMES.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.524
YOUR RELAXER

06:38.273 --> 06:39.524
GOT DISCONTINUED.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.442
(gasps)

06:39.566 --> 06:41.442
(camera shutter clicks)

06:41.484 --> 06:43.070
FIRE ISLAND EXPLODED.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.072
(gasps)

06:43.111 --> 06:45.072
(camera shutter clicks)

06:45.113 --> 06:46.447
PATTI LaBELLE DIED.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.908
(gasps loudly)

06:46.489 --> 06:47.908
(camera shutter clicks)

06:49.201 --> 06:50.451
ALL RIGHT, CHLOE,

06:49.201 --> 06:50.451
LISTEN TO ME.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
IT'S TRUE I HAVEN'T ALWAYS

06:50.493 --> 06:51.619
HONORED THE VETO,

06:51.661 --> 06:54.455
BUT ONLY TIMES WHEN

06:51.661 --> 06:54.455
I REALLY, REALLY LIKED THE GIRL.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.457
OR WANTED

06:54.497 --> 06:56.457
TO KEEP SLEEPING WITH HER.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.625
THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OKAY.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
AND YOU BROKE UP

06:57.667 --> 06:59.502
WITH THOSE GIRLS ANYWAY,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.880
WHICH MEANS I WAS RIGHT

06:59.544 --> 07:01.880
TO VETO THEM.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.548
YEAH. EVENTUALLY,

07:01.922 --> 07:03.548
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ENDED,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.466
BUT  I  DECIDED WHEN,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.466
NOT YOU.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.468
I MEAN, YOU CAN BE

07:05.508 --> 07:07.468
A LITTLE...

07:07.510 --> 07:09.054
MM, DIFFICULT.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.972
(gasps)

07:09.096 --> 07:10.972
SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER

07:09.096 --> 07:10.972
JUST TO TELL YOU ONE THING

07:11.014 --> 07:12.473
AND THEN DO SOMETHING ELSE.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.475
SO YOU'VE

07:12.515 --> 07:14.475
JUST BEEN HUMORING ME?

07:14.517 --> 07:16.477
NO! NO.

07:16.519 --> 07:17.562
WELL...

07:17.604 --> 07:19.398
I MEAN... YEAH, TECHNICALLY.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.524
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:19.439 --> 07:21.524
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.484
CHLOE, LISTEN. I TOLD YOU.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.485
I'M NOT GONNA BREAK UP

07:23.526 --> 07:24.485
WITH EMILY.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.197
NO, I MEANT YOU AND ME.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.197
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
I THINK WE SHOULD

07:28.531 --> 07:30.450
TAKE A BREAK.

07:32.411 --> 07:34.121
MAYBE WE SHOULD.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.497
FINE.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.666
BUT DON'T COME RUNNING TO ME

07:36.539 --> 07:38.666
WHEN YOUR CAREER SUFFERS

07:38.708 --> 07:40.001
BECAUSE YOUR RELATIONSHIP

07:38.708 --> 07:40.001
WITH HER

07:40.043 --> 07:41.502
MAKES YOU SOFT

07:40.043 --> 07:41.502
AND COMPLACENT.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.004
WELL, DON'T YOU COME RUNNING

07:41.544 --> 07:43.004
BACK TO ME WHEN YOU REALIZE

07:43.046 --> 07:45.506
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO LIVE

07:43.046 --> 07:45.506
IN A BEEK-LESS WORLD.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.009
THIS IS SERIOUS. WE SHOULD DO

07:45.548 --> 07:48.009
SOMETHING. THEY'RE BREAKING UP!

07:48.051 --> 07:50.470
DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT THIS.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.597
HEY!

07:52.639 --> 07:53.765
(camera shutter clicks)

07:52.639 --> 07:53.765
NO!

07:53.807 --> 07:55.600
(laughs) TOO SLOW, HO.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.606
(gasps)

08:01.648 --> 08:04.901
(singsongy) I STOLE

08:01.648 --> 08:04.901
SPIKE LEE'S BASEBALL HAT.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.154
I'M NOT WEARING IT. I WON'T WEAR

08:04.943 --> 08:07.154
IT. BUT IT'S FUN TO HOLD.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.613
GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.613
I'LL PUT 'EM IN THERE.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.990
I CAN'T BELIEVE

08:08.655 --> 08:09.990
YOU WENT TO THAT PARTY

08:10.031 --> 08:11.241
AFTER YOU AND JAMES

08:10.031 --> 08:11.241
BROKE UP.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.993
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FRIENDS

08:11.283 --> 08:12.993
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.161
IT IS A BIG DEAL.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.330
IT HAPPENS.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.330
FRIENDSHIPS DIE.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.040
HATS GET STOLEN.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.040
KEYS GO IN THEM.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.042
WELL, YOU CAN PRETEND

08:19.082 --> 08:21.042
YOU DON'T CARE, BUT I CAN'T.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.543
(sighs) YOU BOTH MEAN A LOT

08:21.084 --> 08:22.543
TO ME,

08:22.585 --> 08:24.921
AND I AM NOT GOING

08:22.585 --> 08:24.921
TO CHOOSE SIDES.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.132
I DID THAT ONE WEEKEND

08:24.963 --> 08:27.132
WHEN MY PARENTS SPLIT UP.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.383
I CHOSE MY DAD--

08:28.425 --> 08:29.634
JUNE, CAN YOU SAVE

08:28.425 --> 08:29.634
THIS AWESOME STORY

08:29.676 --> 08:32.012
FOR WHEN YOU'RE HANGING OUT

08:29.676 --> 08:32.012
WITH JAMES? THANKS.

08:34.473 --> 08:35.556
HELLO, LADIES.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.017
NOT TO SOUND LIKE "THATGUY,"

08:37.058 --> 08:39.560
BUT MY ART SHOW FLYERS

08:37.058 --> 08:39.560
ARE READY.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.562
COOL! I'M EXCITED.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.562
I LOVE BUTTER.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
ONE OF THOSE STATES

08:42.647 --> 08:45.650
WHERE CHOLESTEROL'S

08:42.647 --> 08:45.650
A FOOD GROUP?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.735
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.488
DO YOUR PEOPLE EAT

08:47.777 --> 08:49.488
STRAIGHT FROM THE CHURN

08:49.529 --> 08:51.572
OR DO THEY USE PLATES?

08:51.614 --> 08:54.159
CHLOE, I'M NOT DOING

08:51.614 --> 08:54.159
THIS MEAN THING WITH YOU.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.413
DOES ANYONE IN YOUR FAMILY

08:54.201 --> 08:58.413
HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL KNEES?

08:58.455 --> 09:00.248
OH, GOD, I DON'T KNOW

08:58.455 --> 09:00.248
IF IT'S ALLERGIES OR WHAT,

09:00.290 --> 09:02.583
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING

09:00.290 --> 09:02.583
IN THERE.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.378
OH, FORGET IT!

09:02.625 --> 09:04.378
YOU'RE TERRIBLE AT THIS!

09:04.419 --> 09:06.296
(knock on door)

09:08.298 --> 09:10.675
HELLO,

09:08.298 --> 09:10.675
FORMER FRIEND OF JAMES.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.053
I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY

09:10.717 --> 09:13.053
OF RETURNING ALL THE POSSESSIONS

09:13.094 --> 09:14.595
YOU LEFT AT HIS PLACE.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.598
YOUR HANDCUFFS,

09:14.637 --> 09:17.598
A GOO GOO DOLLS CD...

09:17.640 --> 09:19.600
ANOTHER GOO GOO DOLLS CD,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.103
AND A MAP

09:19.642 --> 09:22.103
TO TED DANSON'S HOUSE.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.523
GREAT, BECAUSE

09:22.145 --> 09:24.523
I ALSO PUT TOGETHER

09:24.605 --> 09:27.108
A BOX OF THINGS

09:24.605 --> 09:27.108
THAT JAMES LEFT HERE.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.610
THAT IS WEIRD. I HAVE

09:27.150 --> 09:29.610
THAT SAME BACK SCRATCHER.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.612
AND THAT IS A PHOTO

09:29.652 --> 09:31.612
OF MY DOG MAISIE!

09:31.654 --> 09:34.032
THIS IS  MY  STUFF!

09:31.654 --> 09:34.032
OH, YOU CAUGHT THAT, HUH?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.452
I WAS GONNA SAY, JAMES ALREADY

09:34.074 --> 09:37.452
HAS TWO BACK SCRATCHERS.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.579
YOU'RE LOOKING AT 'EM.

09:41.039 --> 09:41.998
MMM!

09:42.040 --> 09:43.624
(laughs)

09:43.666 --> 09:45.710
IT'S AMAZING. NOBODY HAS EVER

09:43.666 --> 09:45.710
COOKED IN THIS KITCHEN BEFORE.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.628
HE WAS KEEPING MONEY

09:45.752 --> 09:47.628
IN THE OVEN.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.713
HA! I JUST THINK IT'S GREAT

09:48.755 --> 09:50.631
THAT I CAN BE FRIENDS

09:48.755 --> 09:50.631
WITH BOTH YOU AND CHLOE.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
I'M GONNA BE TOTALLY NEUTRAL,

09:50.673 --> 09:52.633
YOU KNOW?

09:52.675 --> 09:53.634
I'M NOT PICKING MY DAD AGAIN.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.429
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S

09:53.676 --> 09:55.429
A STORY HERE, JUNE.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.222
LET'S BLOW PAST IT.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.723
(quietly) OH.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.642
I'M NOT PICKING SIDES, BUT I DO

09:58.765 --> 10:01.642
THINK THAT YOU AND CHLOE SHOU--

10:01.684 --> 10:02.810
I'M--I'M GONNA

10:01.684 --> 10:02.810
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.062
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR

10:02.852 --> 10:04.062
ANYTHING ABOUT CHLOE.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.688
I KNOW EXACTLY

10:04.104 --> 10:05.688
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

10:05.730 --> 10:06.647
THE NEXT TIME

10:05.730 --> 10:06.647
SHE PROJECTILE VOMITS

10:06.689 --> 10:08.442
IN A CLUB

10:06.689 --> 10:08.442
FULL OF 20-SOMETHINGS,

10:08.483 --> 10:10.651
SHE'S NOT GONNA HAVE ME

10:08.483 --> 10:10.651
TO PAY THE DRY CLEANING BILL.

10:10.693 --> 10:13.071
OKAY, SHE DIDN'T REALLY

10:10.693 --> 10:13.071
PROJECTILE VOMIT ALL OVER--

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
LAST WEDNESDAY.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.781
TWICE LAST MONTH.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.747
SAW THE PICTURES

10:21.329 --> 10:22.747
OF YOUR DINNER WITH JAMES

10:22.789 --> 10:24.707
ON INSTAGRAM LAST NIGHT.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.707
OH, YEAH, IT WAS FUN.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.666
YEAH, IT LOOKED LIKE IT.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.586
UH, DID YOU SEE

10:25.708 --> 10:27.586
THE PICTURES I POSTED?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.670
NO, I DIDN'T.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.670
OH, RIGHT!

10:27.627 --> 10:29.670
I DIDN'T POST ANY PICTURES,

10:29.712 --> 10:31.298
BECAUSE I WAS HOME ALONE

10:31.339 --> 10:33.674
WATCHING A DOCUMENTARY

10:31.339 --> 10:33.674
ABOUT SNAKES.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.674
(door bell jingles)

10:59.659 --> 11:01.702
I REPLACED MY SHOES,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.702
I REPLACED MY DOG,

11:01.744 --> 11:02.870
I REPLACED MY ROOMMATE

(chuckles)

16:45.087 --> 16:46.965
(laughs)

16:47.006 --> 16:49.258
HE'S MY JIGGLY WIGGLY

16:47.006 --> 16:49.258
JIGGLEPUSS.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.637
I'LL GET SOME CHEESE CUBES.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.637
ALL RIGHT.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.305
(James chuckles)

16:54.347 --> 16:56.056
AHH! I TELL YOU,

16:56.098 --> 16:59.101
I JUST FEEL  SO  COMFORTABLE

16:56.098 --> 16:59.101
WITH EMILY, WITH MYSELF.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.687
IT JUST...

17:00.728 --> 17:03.147
(sighs) I JUST FEEL GOOD

17:00.728 --> 17:03.147
IN MY OWN BODY.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.900
BUT, JAMES...

17:05.942 --> 17:07.151
Y-YOU'RE AN ACTOR.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.069
AREN'T--AREN'T YOU WORRIED

17:07.193 --> 17:09.069
ABOUT YOUR CAREER?

17:09.111 --> 17:11.948
NAH. MANY FINE ACTORS HAVE HAD

17:09.111 --> 17:11.948
DRAMATIC WEIGHT GAINS

17:11.990 --> 17:13.783
AND JUST KEPT

17:11.990 --> 17:13.783
RIGHT ON WORKING.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.076
UH, VAL KILMER,

17:16.118 --> 17:17.912
VINCE VAUGHN, STEVEN SEAGAL.

17:17.954 --> 17:20.247
I FIND ALL THREE OF THOSE PEOPLE

17:17.954 --> 17:20.247
HARD TO LOOK AT.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.668
ANYWAY, THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.668
THIS IS ABOUT ELI AND HIS SHOW.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.085
RIGHT?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.085
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS!

17:25.127 --> 17:26.379
AH!

17:26.420 --> 17:29.089
JAMES IS VOLUNTARILY DEFLECTING

17:26.420 --> 17:29.089
ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.091
THIS IS HIS ROCK BOTTOM.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.136
THAT HAS  GOT  TO BE

17:31.133 --> 17:34.136
ELI'S MOTHER.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.680
IT'S ELI IN A DRESS.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.390
(laughs)

17:37.431 --> 17:39.392
(door opens)

17:39.433 --> 17:41.310
HEY. (groans)

17:39.433 --> 17:41.310
SORRY, I'M LATE.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.729
I COULDN'T LEAVE WORK EARLY

17:42.770 --> 17:46.106
BECAUSE MY MANAGER RAJ

17:42.770 --> 17:46.106
WAS BEING A REAL HARD ASS.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.985
(sighs) BUT I RESPECT HIM.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.116
HEY.

17:56.158 --> 17:58.202
HEY.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.121
LOOK. THEY'RE BACK TOGETHER.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.790
THEY REALIZED WHAT A MESS

18:01.163 --> 18:02.790
THEY ARE WITHOUT EACH OTHER

18:02.832 --> 18:04.124
AND THEY'RE GONNA TALK.

18:04.166 --> 18:07.837
YOUR VELCRO'S CROOKED.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.296
THANKS.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
YOU'VE GOT FROSTING

18:09.338 --> 18:10.506
IN YOUR HAIR.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.092
OH. I-I HAD FROSTING EARLIER.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.177
(rips Velcro)

18:14.260 --> 18:15.177
THAT'S IT?

18:15.219 --> 18:16.512
THAT CAN'T BE IT.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.222
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M DONE.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.640
I'M NOT GONNA

18:18.264 --> 18:19.640
STAND BACK HERE

18:19.682 --> 18:22.936
AND WATCH THEM THROW AWAY

18:19.682 --> 18:22.936
THIS BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.021
NO MORE BEING NEUTRAL.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.773
I CHOOSE MOM  AND  DAD.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.025
HEY, LOOK.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.234
YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS,

18:30.276 --> 18:31.986
SO YOU SHOULD BE ACTING LIKE IT.

18:32.028 --> 18:33.654
I MEAN, LOOK AT EACH OTHER!

18:33.696 --> 18:37.199
CHLOE, YOU SHOULD

18:33.696 --> 18:37.199
SAY SOMETHING...

18:37.241 --> 18:39.243
I DON'T KNOW,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.243
LIKE, FAT TO HIM.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.954
AND THEN, JAMES,

18:39.285 --> 18:40.954
YOU SHOULD SAY SOMETHING

18:40.995 --> 18:43.163
ABOUT HOW LAME GLOSS MOBILE IS.

18:43.205 --> 18:45.041
THEN, CHLOE, YOU'LL BE ALL LIKE,

18:43.205 --> 18:45.041
"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:45.083 --> 18:47.251
YOU'RE EVEN FATTER

18:45.083 --> 18:47.251
THAN I SAID YOU WERE BEFORE."

18:47.293 --> 18:49.420
AND THEN JAMES WILL BE ALL LIKE,

18:47.293 --> 18:49.420
"WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.756
I MOVE FASTER

18:49.462 --> 18:51.756
THAN GLO-MO DATA TRANSFERS."

18:51.798 --> 18:54.174
AND THEN CHLOE WILL BE LIKE,

18:51.798 --> 18:54.174
"WELL, WHAT IS IT LIKE

18:54.216 --> 18:56.803
COMPETING AGAINST BRIAN DENNEHY

18:54.216 --> 18:56.803
FOR ROLES?"

18:56.844 --> 18:59.263
AND THEN JAMES WILL BE ALL LIKE,

18:56.844 --> 18:59.263
"OH, WELL, WHAT IS IT LIKE

18:59.305 --> 19:01.599
COMPETING AGAINST LESBIANS

18:59.305 --> 19:01.599
FOR SHIRTS?"

19:01.641 --> 19:05.478
BACK AND FORTH!

19:01.641 --> 19:05.478
INSULTS! TEARS! LAUGHTER!

19:05.519 --> 19:07.021
HUGGING?

19:07.063 --> 19:10.691
YES! THEY'RE HUGGING!

19:12.735 --> 19:14.862
SHE'S GOT BUTTER

19:12.735 --> 19:14.862
ON HER BUTT.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.614
(chuckles) BUTTER BUTT.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.200
I... OH, GOD. I WAS STANDING

19:16.656 --> 19:20.200
AGAINST ELI'S WALL.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.578
SHE'S TRYING TO WIPE IT OFF.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.578
SHE'S GOT IT ON HER SWEATER.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.205
SWEATER BUTTER.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.205
OH, NOW LUTHER'S GETTIN'

19:22.620 --> 19:25.205
IN THERE.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.207
BUTTER BUTT RUBBER.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.294
(Luther, lowered voice)

19:29.251 --> 19:30.294
OKAY...

19:35.257 --> 19:37.635
OBVIOUSLY, I'M NOT DOING

19:35.257 --> 19:37.635
SO WELL.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.219
YEAH.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.220
ME, NEITHER.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.058
NICE NECK PEN.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.267
AT LEAST I HAVE A NECK.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.394
(laughs)

19:47.436 --> 19:49.522
I'VE MISSED THIS.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.440
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.440
I GOT SOFT AND COMPLACENT

19:51.482 --> 19:53.233
WITHOUT YOU AROUND

19:51.482 --> 19:53.233
TO KEEP ME SHARP.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
I DON'T WANNA LIVE

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
IN A BEEK-LESS WORLD.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.445
IT'S TOO GRUESOME.

19:56.487 --> 20:00.116
YESTERDAY, I HAD TO FILL OUT

19:56.487 --> 20:00.116
SOMETHING CALLED A W-2 FORM.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.118
I MEAN, I WROTE THE WORD "BALLS"

20:00.158 --> 20:02.118
IN EVERY SECTION,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.537
BUT STILL...

20:02.160 --> 20:04.537
I HAD TO FILL IT OUT.

20:05.579 --> 20:07.165
WHAT IS THIS?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.958
GET RID OF THIS.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.335
EXCUSE ME. THERE YOU GO.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.254
CAN I HAVE A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE,

20:11.377 --> 20:14.254
PLEASE? THANKS.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.924
DON'T EVER BLOW OFF

20:14.296 --> 20:16.924
MY VETO AGAIN.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.467
I SAY WE JUST VETO

20:16.966 --> 20:18.467
THE VETOES.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.260
OKAY, GOOD,

20:18.509 --> 20:20.260
BECAUSE JEFF GORDON CALLED.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.721
HE'S DRIVING 500 TIMES

20:20.302 --> 20:21.721
IN A CIRCLE

20:21.762 --> 20:23.973
AND THEN HE WANTS

20:21.762 --> 20:23.973
TO HANG OUT.

20:24.015 --> 20:25.265
(laughs)

20:25.307 --> 20:26.475
OH, YOU GUYS MADE UP!

20:26.517 --> 20:29.269
YAY! I SAVED

20:26.517 --> 20:29.269
ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.772
YOU KNOW, WHEN I GOT

20:29.311 --> 20:31.772
MY MOM AND DAD BACK TOGETHER--

20:31.814 --> 20:33.149
YOU WEREN'T STANDING 10 FEET

20:33.191 --> 20:34.525
FROM A DINOSAUR MADE

20:33.191 --> 20:34.525
OF RANCID BUTTER,

20:34.567 --> 20:36.276
WHICH YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

20:34.567 --> 20:36.276
LOOKED AT YET.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
NONE OF YOU HAVE

20:36.318 --> 20:38.487
LOOKED AT IT.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.864
LOOK AT IT!

20:39.906 --> 20:41.240
(door slams)

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
YOU'RE LUCKY

20:45.327 --> 20:47.287
YOU'RE A QUICK THIN.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.082
(exhales deeply)

20:47.329 --> 20:49.082
I KNOW. THAT GOT ROUGH.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.167
I WAS HAVING TROUBLE

20:49.123 --> 20:51.167
SEEING MY DONG IN THE SHOWER.

20:51.209 --> 20:53.377
(chuckles) IT'S ALWAYS

20:51.209 --> 20:53.377
KIND OF BEEN HARD TO SEE.

20:53.419 --> 20:54.879
(laughs)

20:53.419 --> 20:54.879
RIGHT, EMILY?

20:54.921 --> 20:56.505
EMILY.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.299
(laughs) I'M SO SORRY.

20:56.547 --> 20:59.299
WE GOT OFF-TRACK THERE.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.384
UH, LISTEN.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.384
(chuckles)

21:00.426 --> 21:02.929
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT

21:00.426 --> 21:02.929
BETWEEN US.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.680
I GOT FAT ON YOUR WATCH.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.306
BUT... JAMES,

21:04.722 --> 21:06.306
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.559
I LIKE YOU NO MATTER WHAT

21:06.348 --> 21:08.559
YOU LOOK LIKE.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.310
YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.310
YEAH, SEE,

21:10.352 --> 21:12.396
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

21:10.352 --> 21:12.396
TO GIVE ME CONDITIONAL LOVE.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.815
I ALREADY HAVE SOMEONE

21:12.438 --> 21:14.815
WHO GIVES ME UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.316
THAT'S ME.

21:16.358 --> 21:19.779
FULL-FAT MILK? I MEAN...

21:19.820 --> 21:21.822
VETO! I VETO LUTHER.
