WEBVTT

01:36.552 --> 01:37.221
Jenna?

01:37.254 --> 01:39.657
Yes, thank you for waiting.

01:39.689 --> 01:40.724
Music okay?

01:40.757 --> 01:41.692
Yeah, it's fine.

01:42.959 --> 01:43.994
You hate classical.

01:44.028 --> 01:44.896
It's okay.

01:49.933 --> 01:52.437
I'm so glad we're doing this.

01:54.638 --> 01:55.840
You still want to, right?

01:58.975 --> 01:59.843
Right?

02:01.811 --> 02:02.679
Okay.

02:05.915 --> 02:07.518
Oh, I forgot to get the gum
you wanted.

02:07.551 --> 02:09.551
Oh my God,
I asked for one thing.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.588
Plus the gum, you mean?

02:11.622 --> 02:14.025
It's okay, I'll get it
when we stop for wine.

02:14.057 --> 02:15.825
Oh, I forgot to put it
in the app

02:15.859 --> 02:17.395
but could you stop
at the liquor store?

02:17.427 --> 02:19.396
It's like two blocks
up on the right.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.598
Got it.

02:20.631 --> 02:22.900
Babe, you have to tell those
things before, to drivers.

02:22.932 --> 02:24.568
It's gonna cost more money now.

02:27.604 --> 02:28.473
Sorry.

02:30.507 --> 02:31.842
It's okay, I'm nervous too.

02:43.954 --> 02:45.757
I'll be right back.

02:54.131 --> 02:57.967
That dog's tied up
outside that cafe every night.

02:58.001 --> 02:59.304
She looks lonely.

03:00.770 --> 03:02.506
No matter how long
they're tied up and waiting,

03:02.538 --> 03:05.942
dogs forget all about it as
soon as their person comes back.

03:05.975 --> 03:07.110
Do you have a dog?

03:07.144 --> 03:08.545
Can't afford a dog.

03:08.579 --> 03:09.513
Yeah, me neither.

03:09.545 --> 03:11.848
Plus, my girlfriend's allergic.

03:11.882 --> 03:13.884
Doing anything fun tonight?

03:13.917 --> 03:15.719
If I don't throw up first.

03:15.752 --> 03:16.986
Why is that?

03:17.020 --> 03:19.390
We are going on a
date with another woman.

03:25.496 --> 03:27.665
Splurged and got the wine
from Moldova.

03:27.698 --> 03:28.532
Mmmm.

03:28.564 --> 03:29.433
She'll love this.

03:33.637 --> 03:35.406
Sorry, it's kind of hot
back here.

03:43.479 --> 03:45.081
Did you get the gum?

03:45.115 --> 03:46.550
Yeah.

03:46.582 --> 03:47.852
It's crazy
how hot it is

03:47.884 --> 03:49.353
and the leaves are falling.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.082
Shit.

04:19.983 --> 04:20.851
Hang on a second!

04:22.985 --> 04:24.154
Just a second!

04:29.059 --> 04:32.862
I told you we'd be late.

04:32.896 --> 04:33.997
What?

04:34.031 --> 04:35.865
I'm on my way.

04:35.899 --> 04:37.567
I can feel my nervous breath

04:37.600 --> 04:39.002
pushing right through the gum.

04:40.903 --> 04:41.872
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:41.904 --> 04:42.774
Come on in.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.477
How's it going?

04:46.509 --> 04:47.411
Good, hi.

04:50.880 --> 04:51.781
I hope you like it.

04:51.814 --> 04:52.682
Mmmm.

04:54.785 --> 04:57.054
The Moldova we talked about.

04:57.086 --> 04:57.954
Cheers.

04:59.790 --> 05:02.460
Unless we all want to fall
into my bed right now.

05:02.492 --> 05:04.060
I thought we'd share some wine.

05:04.093 --> 05:04.961
Yes.

05:07.831 --> 05:09.900
We could all
change our minds too.

05:09.932 --> 05:11.903
We're all in
or we're not, right?

05:12.603 --> 05:15.605
Thank you for saying
that, I'm a little nervous.

05:15.639 --> 05:16.841
Make yourselves at home.

05:16.874 --> 05:19.643
It's not my home, it's
my friend, Daniel's,

05:19.675 --> 05:21.778
but he's like
a brother to me, so.

05:24.581 --> 05:25.516
Your gum.

05:28.084 --> 05:30.221
Kate, can you
put some music on?

05:54.810 --> 05:57.514
Do you have to look so happy?

05:57.548 --> 05:58.649
I don't.

05:58.682 --> 06:01.985
I hope you don't mind if
I bring nuts to the party.

06:02.019 --> 06:03.019
Brilliant.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.524
Brilliant.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.536
Oh.

06:19.569 --> 06:20.538
Wine.

06:20.571 --> 06:24.175
Let me get it.

06:27.276 --> 06:29.079
Can you grab
an opener too?

06:30.213 --> 06:31.082
What?

06:32.315 --> 06:34.718
It's in the drawer.

07:27.771 --> 07:28.639
No?

07:36.112 --> 07:36.947
Cheers.

07:36.980 --> 07:37.848
Yeah.

07:40.117 --> 07:41.819
Is your AC still out?

07:41.851 --> 07:42.752
Sadly.

07:42.786 --> 07:43.453
I'm trying to get
the landlord to fix it

07:43.487 --> 07:45.990
but he hasn't called me back.

07:46.023 --> 07:48.659
I thought you said this was
your friend, Daniel's, place.

07:48.692 --> 07:50.360
Oh, someone takes care of it.

07:50.394 --> 07:52.062
The tenant in the back
is supposed to.

07:52.095 --> 07:54.832
Not the landlord, I meant the...

07:54.865 --> 07:55.766
Maintenance person?

07:55.798 --> 07:56.733
Yes.

07:56.766 --> 07:57.701
Let me.

07:57.735 --> 07:59.169
They call them
caretakers in England,

07:59.201 --> 08:00.338
I got this.

08:05.341 --> 08:07.644
I feel like I'm never
gonna be cool again.

08:08.579 --> 08:10.114
Well, we'll turn
the fan on upstairs.

08:10.146 --> 08:12.115
Plus, we have ice.

08:16.420 --> 08:18.187
Kate told me
you live in London

08:18.221 --> 08:20.391
but do I hear Welsh
in your voice?

08:20.423 --> 08:21.658
She's not lying.

08:22.425 --> 08:23.693
Four years in Wales.

08:23.726 --> 08:24.394
Good ear.

08:25.295 --> 08:26.631
Did you grow up there?

08:27.464 --> 08:31.234
And Michigan, Texas,
San Diego, France and Macedonia

08:31.267 --> 08:32.669
all before 18.

08:32.702 --> 08:33.703
An army brat.

08:33.736 --> 08:35.738
Mom's a Lieutenant Colonel.

08:35.772 --> 08:37.408
Is that above a General?

08:37.441 --> 08:41.010
No, it's Specialist,
Corporal, Sergeant,

08:41.043 --> 08:43.780
Warrant Officer,
2nd and 1st Lieutenants,

08:43.813 --> 08:47.350
Captain, Major,
Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel,

08:47.384 --> 08:48.252
General.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.120
Wait, what about Private?

08:51.154 --> 08:53.790
Oh, that's a starter rank,
everyone gets it.

08:59.361 --> 09:01.097
There are a lot
of Lieutenants.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.368
Is your mom retired now?

09:04.400 --> 09:06.036
Hey, this isn't an interview.

09:08.205 --> 09:11.141
She died four years
ago, so, pretty much.

09:13.009 --> 09:13.878
Mine too.

09:16.746 --> 09:18.716
Mine had a heart attack
in her garden.

09:18.749 --> 09:20.084
Could've been worse.

09:20.116 --> 09:21.317
Embolism on a plane.

09:22.785 --> 09:25.021
My mom's still alive.

09:25.054 --> 09:26.322
Still married, my parents.

09:28.759 --> 09:30.094
It's funny,

09:30.126 --> 09:32.429
sometimes I still pick
up the phone to call her.

09:33.496 --> 09:34.964
Hmmm.

09:37.299 --> 09:39.069
Coat hook
by the door, remember?

09:43.440 --> 09:45.909
I'm gonna try that again.

09:45.942 --> 09:46.811
Yeah.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.447
Was it hard for you?

09:50.480 --> 09:52.416
Must be the thermostat
on this thing.

09:53.549 --> 09:56.019
Kate says
you're working on a novel.

09:56.052 --> 09:58.221
She's been doing
that for like two years.

10:00.524 --> 10:02.225
I have 15 chapters

10:02.259 --> 10:05.028
and a decent second draft

10:05.061 --> 10:08.132
but I just cannot
get the protagonist,

10:08.164 --> 10:09.899
you know, emotionally.

10:09.932 --> 10:11.033
Like, the plot's
totally working...

10:11.067 --> 10:12.168
What's her name?

10:12.201 --> 10:13.504
The protag.

10:13.537 --> 10:14.772
Barb Harrison.

10:16.072 --> 10:16.941
Barb.

10:19.576 --> 10:20.778
Barb.

10:20.811 --> 10:21.545
What?

10:22.846 --> 10:24.548
The name's a statement.

10:24.581 --> 10:27.183
Like "Rock."

10:27.216 --> 10:28.217
Yeah.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.086
Yeah.

10:29.119 --> 10:30.387
But she's a soft rock.

10:33.523 --> 10:35.091
You hate it.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.493
No.

10:36.525 --> 10:38.227
I'm just thinking.

10:38.260 --> 10:41.264
I'm trying to subvert a name

10:41.298 --> 10:43.833
that might make someone think of

10:43.866 --> 10:45.434
a middle class housewife

10:45.467 --> 10:47.270
cheerfully devoted
to her family.

10:48.471 --> 10:50.073
My grandma's name was Barb.

10:51.341 --> 10:52.275
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

10:52.308 --> 10:53.142
What's she like?

10:53.176 --> 10:54.078
She's devoted.

10:56.446 --> 10:57.346
And an alcoholic.

10:57.379 --> 10:59.349
Yeah, I think she had to be.

10:59.381 --> 11:00.383
Ouch.

11:00.417 --> 11:04.855
Just based on what I've heard.

11:06.923 --> 11:08.158
Success!

11:08.191 --> 11:09.293
Magic hands.

11:13.263 --> 11:14.031
Wow.

11:14.063 --> 11:17.134
You have a lot
of science fiction.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.336
Oh, those aren't mine.

11:22.339 --> 11:23.207
Here.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.076
These are mine.

11:27.344 --> 11:29.146
These are all Daniel's books.

11:29.178 --> 11:31.514
I travel so much, I only
carry two at a time.

11:31.548 --> 11:34.618
Yes, Kate said that you are
going to Hawaii in two weeks.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.252
Actually one week.

11:36.285 --> 11:37.386
But I thought it was two.

11:37.419 --> 11:39.622
My surfing lesson, remember?

11:39.655 --> 11:42.091
Oh my Gosh,
I could never surf.

11:42.125 --> 11:43.559
I would break my neck,

11:43.592 --> 11:45.261
drown the first day out.

11:45.294 --> 11:47.029
You could try boogie boarding.

11:47.062 --> 11:48.298
Still fun.

11:53.636 --> 11:55.504
You like Leguin.

11:55.538 --> 11:57.307
Yeah, she's one
of my favorites.

11:58.042 --> 12:01.077
Hey, can you believe
how hot it's been?

12:01.110 --> 12:02.879
Like super hot.

12:09.052 --> 12:10.187
I have to pee.

12:19.296 --> 12:20.497
I love this book.

12:20.529 --> 12:22.164
Have you finished it yet?

12:22.197 --> 12:24.300
Still making
my way through.

12:24.333 --> 12:25.501
I've read it twice.

12:25.534 --> 12:29.338
There were so many things
that I missed the first time.

12:29.371 --> 12:31.274
Does that happen to you?

12:34.677 --> 12:37.014
There's this thing
that I like to do.

12:38.682 --> 12:41.485
I close my eyes...

12:41.518 --> 12:43.586
and...

12:43.620 --> 12:44.453
pick.

12:44.486 --> 12:45.355
It's...

12:46.956 --> 12:49.293
It's kinda like reading
a tarot card for the day.

12:51.126 --> 12:53.362
"When they realized they
only had enough fuel

12:53.395 --> 12:54.997
"to last the week,

12:55.030 --> 12:57.099
"they wrote notes
to their families

12:57.133 --> 12:58.602
"and to their gods,

12:58.634 --> 13:01.672
"after which
they felt a wave of relief,

13:01.705 --> 13:03.373
"euphoria even,

13:03.405 --> 13:06.075
"and they spent
their last days dancing,

13:06.109 --> 13:07.677
"making love,

13:07.711 --> 13:09.480
"and planting the poppy seeds."

13:14.350 --> 13:15.219
So?

13:16.686 --> 13:18.088
Well, first of all,

13:18.120 --> 13:21.057
it reminds me
of the "Awakening."

13:21.091 --> 13:22.591
And, I mean,

13:22.625 --> 13:26.330
the sense of relief after
making an impossible decision.

13:27.998 --> 13:30.500
Having a say
in what happens to you.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.135
Even when the choices suck.

13:36.105 --> 13:37.206
Hey.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.241
You guys want water?

13:39.274 --> 13:40.110
Sure.

13:40.143 --> 13:41.011
Yeah.

13:45.248 --> 13:49.086
So, what tarot card
would that be?

13:49.119 --> 13:49.987
What you read.

13:51.287 --> 13:52.556
The Two of Swords.

13:53.423 --> 13:55.091
Yeah, I need to
start making money.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.525
Like, you know, good money.

13:56.558 --> 13:57.459
Here you go.

13:57.494 --> 13:59.329
Make it to Hawaii sooner
rather than later.

13:59.361 --> 14:01.597
Real estate's
picking up you said, yeah?

14:01.630 --> 14:03.466
I mean, it's better
than bartending, sure.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.235
But I still have
to split commissions

14:05.268 --> 14:08.404
for the next couple of
months with three people.

14:08.437 --> 14:09.740
I'm slated
to make a million dollars

14:09.773 --> 14:11.375
in the next five years though.

14:11.408 --> 14:12.308
Cooperate leasing.

14:12.341 --> 14:13.276
Mm-hmm.

14:15.511 --> 14:17.647
Sorry, it's not very sexy.

14:19.448 --> 14:20.483
You're always sexy.

14:25.154 --> 14:26.355
Oh,

14:26.389 --> 14:27.724
I remembered, I have
to call my sister back.

14:27.756 --> 14:29.459
You know how she gets.

14:30.692 --> 14:33.196
Her sister
is really passive aggressive.

14:33.229 --> 14:35.298
Are you sure
Jenna's into this?

14:35.331 --> 14:36.633
Yeah, of course.

14:37.466 --> 14:39.502
She even said
how beautiful you are.

14:42.639 --> 14:45.375
She's just self-conscious.

14:45.408 --> 14:47.211
She's afraid
you won't be into her.

14:48.610 --> 14:50.547
I am though.

14:50.580 --> 14:51.480
Really?

14:51.514 --> 14:52.349
Mmmm.

14:57.854 --> 14:58.722
She's hot.

15:00.155 --> 15:01.024
Yeah.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.559
Well done.

15:03.592 --> 15:04.660
I mean, you're hot.

15:11.768 --> 15:12.601
Good evening.

15:12.634 --> 15:13.470
Oh.

15:13.503 --> 15:15.105
Hi, good evening.

15:15.138 --> 15:16.173
My name is Clark.

15:16.206 --> 15:17.240
This is Jingles.

15:17.273 --> 15:18.141
Hi, Jingles.

15:18.173 --> 15:19.509
Are you
all right with dogs?

15:19.542 --> 15:20.744
I love dogs.

15:20.777 --> 15:21.610
Can I pet her?

15:21.644 --> 15:22.745
Oh, absolutely.

15:23.679 --> 15:25.181
Hi, Jingles.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.682
Don't know
what I'd do without her.

15:26.716 --> 15:28.350
Awww.

15:28.384 --> 15:31.087
Between her and my nightly
medicinal, I'm all set.

15:31.822 --> 15:33.322
What's your nightly medicinal?

15:33.355 --> 15:36.360
Every night before
nine I have my Negroni.

15:38.227 --> 15:40.629
That's Gin,
Campari and Vermouth?

15:40.663 --> 15:41.664
A wonderful thing.

15:41.697 --> 15:43.332
Oh, I hate Campari.

15:43.365 --> 15:46.269
I wish I liked it, it's
such a pretty color.

15:46.302 --> 15:47.171
Known Mia long?

15:48.804 --> 15:49.972
None of my business.

15:50.005 --> 15:53.543
I'm just amazed she can stay
anonymous the way she does.

15:53.576 --> 15:55.178
Gotten good at it, I guess.

15:55.845 --> 15:57.379
I don't understand.

15:57.413 --> 15:59.416
She's still down to earth.

15:59.448 --> 16:00.450
I appreciate that.

16:03.318 --> 16:04.520
Y'all enjoy yourselves.

16:06.889 --> 16:07.723
Goodnight.

16:07.756 --> 16:08.625
Come on, sweetie.

16:18.634 --> 16:20.169
Does Jenna like to dance?

16:20.202 --> 16:21.270
Mm-hmm.

16:21.303 --> 16:22.805
Okay, remember what
I taught you?

16:22.839 --> 16:23.673
Kind of.

16:23.706 --> 16:25.475
This foot goes...

16:25.508 --> 16:27.911
Forward, step, together, step.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.413
Forward, step, together,
you're getting it.

16:30.446 --> 16:31.815
Okay, now,
put your hand behind your back.

16:31.847 --> 16:33.149
Okay.

16:33.182 --> 16:33.850
Follow me.

16:35.851 --> 16:36.720
Oh.

16:40.190 --> 16:42.192
Not very fair
to your girlfriend.

16:42.225 --> 16:43.225
All right.

16:43.259 --> 16:45.794
I just met your neighbor
with the little dog.

16:45.827 --> 16:46.697
Clark.

16:47.697 --> 16:49.198
He seems to like you a lot.

16:49.231 --> 16:50.533
Terrific guy.

16:50.567 --> 16:51.668
Yeah.

16:51.701 --> 16:53.370
That fling that you had

16:53.403 --> 16:56.139
with the rocker when you
met Kate at the hotel bar,

16:56.907 --> 16:58.775
I would love
to hear the whole story.

16:59.975 --> 17:00.844
Oh.

17:01.910 --> 17:02.812
Well...

17:05.248 --> 17:06.150
I was at her show

17:07.482 --> 17:10.220
and I was standing
right in the front

17:11.453 --> 17:13.923
and I couldn't
take my eyes off of her.

17:13.957 --> 17:15.559
I thought maybe she
was looking at me too

17:15.592 --> 17:17.227
but I couldn't be sure.

17:18.260 --> 17:19.762
And then afterwards,

17:19.796 --> 17:23.266
I was outside stuffing
my face with a burrito

17:23.298 --> 17:24.567
and suddenly she was there

17:25.902 --> 17:27.737
and she recognized me
from the show

17:27.769 --> 17:30.339
and she asked me to go back
to her hotel for a drink.

17:30.373 --> 17:31.475
Just like that?

17:32.808 --> 17:33.710
Just like that.

17:34.676 --> 17:35.544
Who is she?

17:35.577 --> 17:36.579
I can't say.

17:36.613 --> 17:37.447
Come on.

17:37.480 --> 17:38.480
I promised her.

17:38.513 --> 17:40.250
I couldn't stick to that.

17:40.282 --> 17:41.817
So did you go in the same car?

17:41.851 --> 17:42.719
A cab.

17:43.486 --> 17:47.224
and she put her hand
on the seat next to me,

17:47.257 --> 17:47.924
like this.

17:49.358 --> 17:51.660
And then she
moved closer so that

17:51.693 --> 17:53.563
her right thigh
was touching my left.

17:54.830 --> 17:55.998
And I was shaking.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.434
I was so fucking exciting
to be near her.

18:02.337 --> 18:03.206
Then what?

18:05.040 --> 18:05.908
Then...

18:06.942 --> 18:08.578
She put her hand on my leg.

18:11.547 --> 18:12.848
And I looked at her

18:14.683 --> 18:16.220
and I put my hand on hers.

18:22.458 --> 18:24.394
And then she kissed me.

18:25.961 --> 18:26.963
Very lightly.

18:28.730 --> 18:30.400
On just my bottom lip.

18:31.366 --> 18:33.036
Just the bottom?

18:33.068 --> 18:35.838
She was an incredible kisser,
do you know what I mean?

18:35.872 --> 18:36.740
I do.

18:38.607 --> 18:42.979
When we first kissed,
I never wanted it to end.

18:43.011 --> 18:44.880
And your chemistry
with her was so amazing,

18:44.913 --> 18:46.915
it's like when you
walked into the room,

18:46.949 --> 18:49.719
it's like a slow motion
tornado or something.

18:49.751 --> 18:51.587
The whole room stopped.

18:51.621 --> 18:53.523
And then you
made her a dirty martini.

18:53.556 --> 18:55.659
And your gin and tonic.

18:55.692 --> 18:58.028
Oh my God, of course,
you know who the rocker is.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.596
I mean,
she looked a little familiar

18:59.628 --> 19:01.798
but I didn't actually
know who she was.

19:01.830 --> 19:02.531
No, you do.

19:02.565 --> 19:04.933
But I promised
I wouldn't tell.

19:04.967 --> 19:06.803
But it's me.

19:06.836 --> 19:09.639
If you wanna break a
promise, that's up to you.

19:09.672 --> 19:10.539
No.

19:14.676 --> 19:16.379
What happened after cocktails?

19:17.079 --> 19:18.914
I'm gonna get some matches.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.085
Hey, babe,

19:22.117 --> 19:24.687
I feel so dorky.

19:24.721 --> 19:26.556
I don't think
that I can do this.

19:26.588 --> 19:28.791
Let's just wait for
a little while, okay?

19:28.825 --> 19:30.494
If you feel bad then you can go.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.429
By myself?

19:35.664 --> 19:36.598
I meant, we can go.

19:36.632 --> 19:37.968
Like, both of us.

19:40.970 --> 19:41.837
Okay.

19:43.506 --> 19:45.075
I think I have some
nut skin in my teeth

19:45.107 --> 19:47.711
so I'm gonna just
take care of that.

20:05.694 --> 20:06.762
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:05.721 --> 21:06.589
You're funny.

21:10.692 --> 21:11.627
There you are.

21:13.628 --> 21:15.464
Can you guys light some candles?

21:15.498 --> 21:16.165
Sure.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.136
I'm gonna put some
birdseed in the thingy.

21:25.474 --> 21:26.542
I love you.

21:36.618 --> 21:38.454
Your lips look nice.

21:43.726 --> 21:44.627
Shit!

21:44.660 --> 21:45.662
Oh, let's get it under water.

21:45.694 --> 21:46.528
Go, go, go, go.

21:46.561 --> 21:48.063
Let's get it under water.

21:48.096 --> 21:50.032
Oh my God,
this is my good hand.

21:50.066 --> 21:52.101
Yeah but it's fine,
give it a second.

21:52.134 --> 21:54.503
It's not helping.

21:54.537 --> 21:55.572
All right, all right.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.240
Oh God, I'm so nervous.

21:57.272 --> 21:58.607
There's so many things.

21:58.641 --> 22:00.009
It's fine,
you're ambidextrous.

22:00.041 --> 22:00.942
It's okay.

22:00.977 --> 22:02.946
That's not even
what I'm worried about.

22:03.846 --> 22:04.713
Are you okay?

22:05.981 --> 22:07.683
What if I can't...

22:08.651 --> 22:09.519
Stop.

22:11.119 --> 22:12.855
You're as sexy as butter.

22:13.923 --> 22:15.657
You can't even eat butter.

22:15.691 --> 22:17.093
No but I wish that I could.

22:28.237 --> 22:29.506
Such a good kisser.

22:32.173 --> 22:33.643
Better than Mia?

22:33.675 --> 22:35.678
I don't know,
we're about to find out.

22:36.913 --> 22:38.214
I'm sure she can't compare.

22:41.983 --> 22:43.586
Kate, I just...

22:44.554 --> 22:47.957
I feel like something is
off, so I just wanted to ask.

22:47.990 --> 22:48.825
Have you...

22:48.857 --> 22:49.725
What?

22:50.726 --> 22:51.595
Have I what?

22:54.297 --> 22:56.533
What if I can't orgasm?

22:56.566 --> 22:59.035
I can't relax with new lovers.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.203
The first couple times
I'm so self-conscious.

23:01.237 --> 23:02.639
I know, I remember.

23:05.040 --> 23:05.942
Yeah.

23:05.976 --> 23:08.845
You didn't orgasm
our first time either.

23:08.877 --> 23:09.913
I did.

23:09.945 --> 23:11.813
Oh really?

23:11.846 --> 23:12.682
Mm-hmm.

23:12.714 --> 23:13.582
I was just quiet.

23:25.161 --> 23:27.330
I made lasagna
if you're hungry.

23:27.363 --> 23:29.199
Thanks but I have guests.

23:29.965 --> 23:31.633
I saw one of
your guests earlier,

23:31.666 --> 23:33.702
that's why I thought
you might be hungry.

23:35.037 --> 23:36.005
They'll be gone
in the morning.

23:36.038 --> 23:38.040
If you want, I can help
you with your work then.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.109
Good luck to you, darlin'.

23:41.143 --> 23:42.778
Thank you, goodnight.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.057
Maybe you can
help make it happen.

23:55.090 --> 23:56.025
That's brilliant.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.261
Not now, not now.

24:00.328 --> 24:02.030
She could be back any minute.

24:02.064 --> 24:03.166
Isn't that the point?

24:04.299 --> 24:05.100
No.

24:05.134 --> 24:07.737
Okay, listen,
when we're in there

24:07.769 --> 24:10.038
and she's working on me

24:10.071 --> 24:12.107
and I'm enjoying it

24:12.141 --> 24:15.144
but I just know that
I'm not gonna get there.

24:17.646 --> 24:18.615
I have an idea.

24:18.647 --> 24:19.648
What about a safe word?

24:19.682 --> 24:22.684
Like a "Kate takes over"
safe word.

24:22.718 --> 24:24.220
Yes, perfect, okay.

24:25.988 --> 24:28.391
"Heaven,"
I'm gonna say, "Heaven."

24:28.423 --> 24:29.258
"Heaven."

24:29.290 --> 24:30.225
Okay, how many times?

24:30.259 --> 24:31.894
Like a couple times,
three times, four times?

24:31.926 --> 24:34.196
My mind is not gonna
be working well in there,

24:34.230 --> 24:38.034
so I say "Heaven"
any number of times

24:38.067 --> 24:43.038
and you come in and take
over and get me there, okay?

24:43.939 --> 24:46.275
Wouldn't it make more
sense if we said "Limbo?"

24:46.307 --> 24:48.744
No, that's not
very flattering.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.846
You can count on me.

24:51.780 --> 24:53.682
That's a cute little dish.

24:55.017 --> 24:55.918
Got it in Thailand.

24:55.951 --> 24:57.753
God, I wish
I could travel the world.

24:57.787 --> 25:01.024
But I would definitely
end up kidnapped

25:01.057 --> 25:02.357
or dysentery.

25:03.692 --> 25:04.693
Probably both.

25:06.828 --> 25:09.765
There's a really lovely
cross breeze upstairs.

25:09.798 --> 25:12.102
Plus, we can put the fan on.

25:19.208 --> 25:20.076
Go.

25:25.247 --> 25:27.050
Just through here.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.351
Oh.

25:28.384 --> 25:31.354
Hey, Kate,
look it's gentle moss.

25:31.386 --> 25:33.455
Our kitchen's the same color.

25:33.489 --> 25:34.423
Yeah.

25:34.457 --> 25:39.095
Awww.

25:39.127 --> 25:40.195
Oh, come on.

25:41.430 --> 25:42.865
Clark has one job.

25:43.898 --> 25:45.200
This house is falling apart.

25:47.103 --> 25:47.971
Never mind.

25:59.214 --> 26:00.282
Excuse me.

26:00.316 --> 26:01.183
Okay.

26:19.401 --> 26:20.436
Hey.

26:20.469 --> 26:23.940
Should we go play
"Spin the Bottle" downstairs?

26:23.972 --> 26:25.207
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.509
Okay.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.409
Yeah.

26:31.946 --> 26:33.782
Oh, tequila.

26:33.816 --> 26:35.852
Body shots, that will
cool you right down.

26:35.884 --> 26:36.752
Awesome.

26:37.519 --> 26:39.355
How exactly do you do that?

26:39.387 --> 26:41.022
Have you guys
never done this together?

26:41.056 --> 26:42.525
No, definitely not.

26:42.557 --> 26:46.461
Okay, so, I am going to lick
you on the neck right here

26:46.494 --> 26:48.096
and then I'm gonna salt you.

26:48.130 --> 26:49.932
Oh my Gosh, I'm so sweaty,
I hope you can't smell.

26:49.964 --> 26:52.134
And then I'm gonna lick
all the salt off the area.

26:52.167 --> 26:54.336
Then take a shot,
then bite the lime.

26:55.436 --> 26:56.972
Ready, babe?

26:57.006 --> 26:57.807
Yeah.

26:57.839 --> 26:59.375
Wait, what was
the last part again?

26:59.407 --> 27:01.943
Okay, I'm gonna lick you,
salt you and lick you,

27:01.977 --> 27:03.379
shot, lime.

27:03.412 --> 27:04.447
- Ready?
- Okay.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.048
Uh huh.

27:06.080 --> 27:07.149
Okay.

27:10.118 --> 27:12.121
Oh, that makes me dizzy.

27:14.256 --> 27:15.458
It's in my shirt.

27:15.490 --> 27:18.994
I'll get it late,
don't worry.

27:19.028 --> 27:20.930
All right.

27:20.962 --> 27:22.230
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:22.263 --> 27:23.298
Lime off, babe.

27:23.332 --> 27:24.200
Do it.

27:29.471 --> 27:30.339
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

27:33.875 --> 27:35.278
Spin the bottle?

27:35.310 --> 27:36.144
Good idea.

27:36.178 --> 27:37.079
All right.

27:37.112 --> 27:38.480
Da, da, da, da, da, da, daaa.

27:40.615 --> 27:41.483
Go.

27:46.221 --> 27:47.089
Hello.

28:03.038 --> 28:03.906
Perfect.

28:07.009 --> 28:08.411
Are you hot?

28:08.443 --> 28:09.311
Yeah.

28:09.345 --> 28:11.079
Do you need some ice?

28:11.113 --> 28:13.016
Ice would be amazing.

28:14.415 --> 28:16.219
Hey, are you having fun?

28:16.251 --> 28:17.552
Yes.

28:17.586 --> 28:18.855
I am.

28:18.887 --> 28:20.021
I'm having a great time.

28:20.055 --> 28:21.390
I don't wanna go home.

28:21.423 --> 28:22.291
Good.

28:24.259 --> 28:26.095
Only one ice cube left.

28:26.127 --> 28:27.429
Terrible host.

28:27.462 --> 28:28.932
Would you go get some more?

28:30.398 --> 28:31.266
All right.

28:32.134 --> 28:34.502
It's at the gas station
just down the street.

28:34.536 --> 28:35.404
I know.

28:37.338 --> 28:39.075
Back in a jiff.

28:40.041 --> 28:42.310
Thank you.

28:42.344 --> 28:43.546
You feeling all right?

28:44.246 --> 28:47.316
I'm feeling great
just really hot.

28:47.348 --> 28:49.251
I will definitely help.

28:49.285 --> 28:52.521
You just need to put it
at your points.

28:52.554 --> 28:55.391
Do you want me to show
you before this melts?

28:55.423 --> 28:56.259
Yeah.

28:56.291 --> 28:57.626
Let's go outside.

28:57.660 --> 28:58.528
Okay.

29:08.671 --> 29:09.572
Oh, here you go.

29:12.974 --> 29:15.677
You need to get it
on the points.

29:15.711 --> 29:16.578
Here.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.148
Wrist.

29:21.650 --> 29:22.518
Wrist.

29:23.986 --> 29:24.653
Neck.

29:27.256 --> 29:28.090
Wanna try?

29:28.123 --> 29:28.991
Mm-hmm

29:30.025 --> 29:30.660
Oh.

29:32.126 --> 29:33.294
Oh my goodness, let me do it.

29:33.327 --> 29:36.398
You're gonna get heated up
again with all that movement.

29:36.432 --> 29:37.933
Wrists.

29:55.317 --> 29:56.184
Neck.

30:10.632 --> 30:13.068
I can't pay attention
to two women at once.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.240
You guys have been
together a year, yeah?

30:18.140 --> 30:19.008
Almost two.

30:20.776 --> 30:24.212
Just pay attention to me then.

30:26.548 --> 30:28.183
All right.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.752
Where'd you guys meet?

30:29.785 --> 30:31.019
At the laundry mat.

30:32.054 --> 30:34.023
She gave me a dryer sheet.

30:34.056 --> 30:35.024
Hard to come by.

30:36.491 --> 30:38.126
They're like stamps, you know?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.229
Every time
I need a stamp I'm like,

30:40.261 --> 30:42.330
"Why don't I have any stamps."

30:43.499 --> 30:48.471
And then I borrow one and
I forget all about stamps.

30:49.404 --> 30:50.705
Amnesia of the mundane.

30:50.739 --> 30:52.575
I only remember things
that don't matter.

30:52.607 --> 30:53.542
It might matter.

30:54.509 --> 30:56.378
You can't really know.

31:00.281 --> 31:01.750
Come dance with me.

31:04.486 --> 31:05.554
I don't want to
step on your little toes

31:05.586 --> 31:06.654
with my big boots.

31:06.688 --> 31:07.557
Take 'em off.

31:09.090 --> 31:09.758
Okay.

31:12.227 --> 31:15.531
Did you know that
moons can have moons

31:15.564 --> 31:18.100
and they're called "moon moons."

31:20.669 --> 31:21.537
Here.

31:24.506 --> 31:27.176
Are you worried about Kate?

31:27.209 --> 31:28.076
You're sweet.

31:31.446 --> 31:32.647
Listen,

31:32.682 --> 31:36.285
if we all end up in a daisy
chain foot rub, I'll be happy.

31:37.385 --> 31:38.721
I don't expect sex.

31:39.821 --> 31:41.456
Doesn't matter one bit.

31:41.490 --> 31:43.325
I'm so attracted to you.

31:45.227 --> 31:47.096
I didn't think
that I would be but...

31:48.763 --> 31:49.598
I am.

31:56.738 --> 31:58.408
You've done this before, right?

31:59.607 --> 32:00.475
Which part?

32:03.511 --> 32:04.746
Can I take your hair down?

32:05.747 --> 32:06.849
Sure.

32:06.882 --> 32:09.052
I just wanna see how it moves.

32:20.729 --> 32:21.596
Beautiful.

32:26.835 --> 32:28.737
Do you want me
to read your palm?

32:28.769 --> 32:30.839
Since you like tarot,
you'd probably like that.

32:30.873 --> 32:31.707
Yeah.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.575
Yeah.

32:32.607 --> 32:33.475
Scoot in.

32:40.148 --> 32:41.282
You're right-handed, yeah?

32:41.316 --> 32:42.184
Mostly.

32:44.853 --> 32:48.891
Our dominate hand tells us
about our past experiences

32:48.923 --> 32:49.826
and what we'll do.

32:50.893 --> 32:53.328
And our passive hand

32:53.362 --> 32:56.899
tells us about the traits and
tendencies we were born with.

32:56.932 --> 32:59.268
What do they say
about food allergies?

33:04.873 --> 33:06.442
Oh.

33:06.474 --> 33:07.342
What?

33:08.277 --> 33:10.746
Your heart line has a
couple of wild forks in it

33:10.778 --> 33:13.382
and they intersect
with the life line.

33:14.182 --> 33:16.285
Does that mean
I'm gonna die young?

33:17.451 --> 33:19.321
I'm never gonna finish my book.

33:21.289 --> 33:24.159
No, it means that you
are unpredictable in love

33:24.826 --> 33:27.395
and the lifeline doesn't
talk about how long you live.

33:27.429 --> 33:28.865
It's about how you live.

33:33.535 --> 33:35.504
Oh, that feels really good.

33:35.537 --> 33:36.404
Yeah?

33:40.342 --> 33:41.810
Ow.

33:41.843 --> 33:42.644
God.

33:42.676 --> 33:45.413
I burned myself
lighting the candle.

33:45.446 --> 33:46.848
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

33:47.782 --> 33:50.752
It's okay, I forgot about it.

33:50.786 --> 33:51.653
Amnesia.

34:00.528 --> 34:01.897
I hope you don't forget that.

34:03.798 --> 34:04.733
Hey.

34:04.767 --> 34:06.735
I was just looking at
her pour, sour finger.

34:06.768 --> 34:08.737
Yeah, she's ambidextrous,
it's fine.

34:08.768 --> 34:10.239
Thanks for the ice.

34:14.742 --> 34:15.710
You feeling better?

34:15.744 --> 34:16.612
Yeah.

34:17.478 --> 34:19.246
Brought you something.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.748
Oh, my favorite popsicles.

34:20.782 --> 34:21.717
You're the best.

34:22.884 --> 34:23.784
I thought there'd be
more food here

34:23.818 --> 34:25.753
but I don't think
she has a lot of money.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.422
We should've brought a dish.

34:27.456 --> 34:28.989
What, like a potluck?

34:29.023 --> 34:31.393
We're the pots.

34:31.425 --> 34:32.893
True.

34:32.927 --> 34:35.830
Should we go
get more comfortable?

34:35.864 --> 34:36.731
Sure.

34:38.266 --> 34:39.667
Kate, can you
grab the tequila?

34:39.701 --> 34:40.570
Yeah.

34:48.943 --> 34:49.844
Let's play a game.

34:49.878 --> 34:51.280
I love games.

34:54.916 --> 34:55.784
So,

34:56.518 --> 34:59.854
let's go around
and each tell a story.

34:59.887 --> 35:02.023
Something about our childhood

35:02.056 --> 35:05.026
or something that happened
at college or at work.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.996
Something not mundane.

35:07.028 --> 35:07.896
Tidbits.

35:09.364 --> 35:10.132
And then the other two people

35:10.164 --> 35:11.967
get to ask
two questions about it.

35:12.934 --> 35:14.036
Okay.

35:14.068 --> 35:15.438
Mia, you go first.

35:16.704 --> 35:17.806
Let's make it something like

35:17.838 --> 35:20.509
the first time
we all did something.

35:20.541 --> 35:22.677
Mmmmm.

35:22.710 --> 35:23.745
You just drank.

35:23.778 --> 35:27.315
Does that mean that you've
had a lot of threesomes?

35:27.349 --> 35:28.751
Babe, this isn't
"Never Have I Ever."

35:28.784 --> 35:30.353
I'm just drinking to drink.

35:32.019 --> 35:32.887
Right.

35:33.855 --> 35:35.925
Right, right.

35:37.559 --> 35:38.427
Okay, so,

35:40.429 --> 35:43.632
the first time
I had a physical fight.

35:43.664 --> 35:46.335
I had just moved to Texas and
there was a boy in my class

35:46.367 --> 35:48.770
and he was such a bully.

35:48.804 --> 35:51.307
He destroyed my science project.

35:51.340 --> 35:52.574
So I followed him
into the bathroom

35:52.606 --> 35:54.342
and I punched him in the face.

35:55.610 --> 35:56.912
You punched someone
in the face?

35:56.945 --> 35:57.880
I was mad.

35:57.913 --> 35:59.681
Besides, I had just
moved to that school.

35:59.715 --> 36:01.750
If I didn't do something,
I would've been mincemeat.

36:01.782 --> 36:02.851
What happened next?

36:02.884 --> 36:06.489
So he pushed me and
pinned me down to the ground

36:07.456 --> 36:10.425
and lucky a teacher came
in and ripped him off me.

36:10.458 --> 36:11.460
How old were you?

36:11.492 --> 36:12.360
Eleven.

36:14.896 --> 36:18.467
And what was
your science project?

36:18.500 --> 36:21.503
It was a model of the moon
made out of sugar cubes.

36:23.070 --> 36:24.038
So,

36:24.072 --> 36:26.375
a square moon?

36:26.407 --> 36:27.175
Hmmmm.

36:27.208 --> 36:29.644
Did you get into
a lot of fights?

36:29.677 --> 36:31.446
That was two questions.

36:31.480 --> 36:32.347
Fine.

36:34.483 --> 36:35.351
Your turn.

36:36.650 --> 36:37.819
Okay.

36:37.853 --> 36:38.721
Let's see.

36:39.621 --> 36:42.458
Oh, I was in high school,
my first job.

36:43.125 --> 36:45.594
I was cleaning offices
from five to nine.

36:45.626 --> 36:47.628
One of them was like a
dentist's office and,

36:47.661 --> 36:50.698
you know those like nitrous
masks they put over your face?

36:51.867 --> 36:55.538
My best friend and I would
put it on and get so high.

36:56.670 --> 36:58.139
Whoa, I never knew about that.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.574
You could've died.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.043
Definitely could have, yes.

37:02.010 --> 37:03.012
What was it like?

37:03.778 --> 37:08.351
I mean, it was kind of
like floating, hopeful.

37:09.951 --> 37:12.621
Kinda felt like
it was like being in love.

37:15.824 --> 37:17.592
And then you stole
those mini toothpastes

37:17.626 --> 37:19.094
that they give out to kids.

37:19.126 --> 37:21.596
Yes.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.132
How do you know about that?

37:23.164 --> 37:25.099
Oh, we talked about it
in the bar.

37:25.132 --> 37:25.833
Hmmm.

37:25.867 --> 37:27.702
Well do you know
about the rings?

37:29.637 --> 37:32.875
You know how dentists give
out those toys or whatever

37:32.907 --> 37:33.976
when they fill kids cavities?

37:34.009 --> 37:36.144
Like, they have
the big jewels on them?

37:36.177 --> 37:37.612
I took a bunch of those.

37:37.646 --> 37:38.480
Why?

37:38.512 --> 37:39.313
I don't know.

37:39.347 --> 37:40.883
Thought they were pretty,
I guess.

37:41.782 --> 37:43.518
Maybe it was revenge for

37:43.552 --> 37:45.721
me having braces my
whole life or something.

37:47.021 --> 37:48.657
You should be thankful
you had braces

37:48.690 --> 37:51.460
because now you have
such perfect teeth.

37:53.862 --> 37:55.898
Jenna would never
steal anything.

37:55.931 --> 37:57.532
Too honest.

37:57.565 --> 37:59.567
You say it like
it's a bad thing.

38:01.068 --> 38:04.206
I just don't like
feeling guilty.

38:04.239 --> 38:08.644
Even if I go into a store
and the aisle's empty,

38:08.677 --> 38:09.778
I feel guilty.

38:10.778 --> 38:12.947
Because you think
you'll get away with it.

38:12.981 --> 38:14.583
I don't know.

38:14.615 --> 38:18.987
Catholic school just made
me feel guilty for existing.

38:20.722 --> 38:22.557
All right, Jenna, your turn.

38:22.590 --> 38:23.458
Okay.

38:26.728 --> 38:27.930
My first kiss.

38:30.130 --> 38:33.701
So I was babysitting
with my friend

38:33.735 --> 38:38.606
and the kids had
this Batman mask

38:38.639 --> 38:41.476
and she puts the mask on

38:41.510 --> 38:43.078
and starts talking
like she's Batman

38:43.110 --> 38:45.780
and like
I'm Batman's girlfriend.

38:45.813 --> 38:48.983
She kisses me through the
mask and I kiss her back

38:49.016 --> 38:51.619
but there's
that plastic between us.

38:52.353 --> 38:55.923
And then I wanted to put
on the mask and be Batman

38:55.956 --> 38:59.193
but we heard the parents
coming up the driveway,

38:59.226 --> 39:01.230
so that was it.

39:03.565 --> 39:04.967
Did you ever kiss her again?

39:06.934 --> 39:07.835
No.

39:07.869 --> 39:09.605
We were neighborhood friends,
you know?

39:09.637 --> 39:13.040
We played soccer and rode
bikes and went swimming.

39:13.074 --> 39:15.077
I wanted to but...

39:15.110 --> 39:17.880
But she wasn't a boy but
you didn't think you could.

39:20.282 --> 39:21.717
What were you like, 13?

39:21.750 --> 39:22.818
Mm-hmm.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.923
I have a mask in my suitcase.

39:28.956 --> 39:29.991
I can show you.

39:51.746 --> 39:52.748
No.

39:52.780 --> 39:53.815
No, no, no.

39:53.847 --> 39:55.016
No sleeping.

39:55.050 --> 39:57.586
No, no, no, I'm not sleeping.

39:57.619 --> 39:58.687
Okay.

39:58.719 --> 39:59.554
You having fun?

39:59.588 --> 40:00.990
I'm having a great time.

40:02.856 --> 40:04.259
You look pretty.

40:05.193 --> 40:07.229
You look beautiful.

40:22.210 --> 40:23.077
Hi.

40:23.110 --> 40:26.181
Hi.

40:26.213 --> 40:27.282
Get on up there.

40:28.349 --> 40:30.219
It's not Batman but...

41:40.789 --> 41:43.992
Oh my gosh, you have to
send that to me right now.

41:44.025 --> 41:45.661
I'm gonna put
my number in here, yeah?

41:45.693 --> 41:46.894
Sure.

41:51.331 --> 41:54.769
Can you show me
that dance again?

41:54.802 --> 41:56.971
All right.

43:01.902 --> 43:02.770
Cheers.

44:01.362 --> 44:02.864
Woo!

44:17.579 --> 44:18.447
Uh oh.

44:22.617 --> 44:24.219
Keep her up!

45:46.668 --> 45:51.439
I hate to get up but I
need to use the bathroom.

45:51.472 --> 45:52.341
Great.

45:54.041 --> 45:55.476
Terrible timing, sorry.

45:56.443 --> 46:01.449
Okay.

46:04.018 --> 46:07.054
You look so beautiful
right now.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.124
What, you do.

46:14.594 --> 46:16.097
Don't forget though, okay?

46:17.065 --> 46:19.000
If I need you to step in.

46:19.032 --> 46:20.168
I won't.

46:20.201 --> 46:21.469
I promise.

46:21.501 --> 46:26.507
Okay.

46:28.476 --> 46:29.945
Hey.

46:29.978 --> 46:31.512
- Hey.
- Hi.

46:34.449 --> 46:36.451
Can I take your socks off?

46:37.485 --> 46:38.420
Yeah.

46:55.068 --> 46:56.538
Ready?

46:56.570 --> 46:58.505
Yeah, I'm ready.

48:21.856 --> 48:23.325
I'm in Heaven.

48:24.659 --> 48:27.128
I could do this all night.

48:37.170 --> 48:39.073
So close, I'm in Heaven.

48:43.143 --> 48:43.811
Oh, dear God.

48:44.744 --> 48:46.213
Oh, dear God in Heaven.

48:50.650 --> 48:52.053
I'm sorry, I'm too tense.

48:53.688 --> 48:55.557
We go all night.

48:55.590 --> 48:59.126
Just tell me, us, whatever
it is that you want.

48:59.159 --> 49:01.128
We could all take a nap too.

49:01.161 --> 49:01.829
Yeah.

49:04.498 --> 49:06.233
Oh, God, babe, I'm so sorry.

49:07.635 --> 49:08.503
I forgot.

49:09.804 --> 49:11.506
I'm just,
it's too much pressure, okay?

49:11.539 --> 49:12.407
I'm just gonna.

49:13.875 --> 49:14.742
Wait.

49:16.911 --> 49:19.581
I just, I need 10 minutes.

49:55.815 --> 49:56.684
Hi.

49:57.684 --> 49:59.586
I fell asleep.

49:59.619 --> 50:00.489
Me too.

50:02.322 --> 50:03.424
Is Jenna okay?

50:04.458 --> 50:06.360
- She's okay.
- Yeah?

50:06.393 --> 50:08.328
She just needs a reset.

50:08.362 --> 50:09.231
She'll be fine.

50:10.398 --> 50:11.833
Maybe I wasn't doing
what she likes.

50:11.865 --> 50:14.536
No.

50:14.568 --> 50:15.436
You're amazing.

50:17.804 --> 50:18.772
Best I've ever had.

50:21.242 --> 50:21.910
Come on.

50:27.347 --> 50:29.416
You know that I'm
falling for you, right?

50:31.619 --> 50:33.288
It's only because I'm leaving.

50:35.489 --> 50:36.358
No.

50:37.391 --> 50:39.860
Jenna's brilliant
and she's fun.

50:39.893 --> 50:41.629
Why would you
wanna fuck that up?

50:47.534 --> 50:48.636
You already messed it.

50:50.737 --> 50:51.940
I don't know.

51:00.248 --> 51:00.882
Hello.

51:00.914 --> 51:01.782
Hi, again.

51:06.353 --> 51:10.290
It goes from hot to cold
real quick around here.

51:10.324 --> 51:11.858
I'm just taking
a break from writing.

51:11.891 --> 51:12.992
It's not writer's block,

51:13.027 --> 51:15.764
it's just too big a snow
ball to get my arms around.

51:17.030 --> 51:18.333
Want some?

51:18.365 --> 51:19.233
Just coffee.

51:23.536 --> 51:24.405
Mmmm.

51:25.539 --> 51:27.875
Wow, that's really good,
thank you.

51:27.907 --> 51:28.777
Thank you.

51:29.510 --> 51:31.545
Make sure you take those
wet socks off.

51:31.579 --> 51:32.948
You don't wanna catch a cold.

51:34.282 --> 51:35.850
I'm about to go home anyway.

51:35.882 --> 51:38.319
I usually don't see
women leave all weekend.

51:40.721 --> 51:43.557
So you've known Mia
for a long time.

51:43.590 --> 51:44.458
Oh yeah.

51:45.159 --> 51:48.530
Bought the place six years
ago after she sold "Lucinda."

51:49.764 --> 51:52.601
Let's me stay here
to work and recover.

51:53.567 --> 51:54.436
Wait.

51:56.469 --> 51:58.539
Mia wrote "Lucina Ancient?"

52:00.775 --> 52:02.277
Mia is R.S. Corson,

52:02.309 --> 52:04.612
the author that no one
has ever seen in public?

52:05.945 --> 52:07.681
Don't tell her
I said anything.

52:09.016 --> 52:11.253
You liked her
already anyway, right?

52:15.623 --> 52:16.625
Goodnight.

52:19.327 --> 52:20.328
Goodnight.

54:22.449 --> 54:23.784
Fuck you, Kate.

55:12.166 --> 55:13.067
Hi.

55:23.177 --> 55:24.178
Can I have some?

55:24.210 --> 55:28.114
Mm-hmm.

55:28.148 --> 55:29.017
Me too.

55:36.824 --> 55:38.159
I have an idea.

55:38.192 --> 55:38.860
Oh yeah?

55:38.893 --> 55:40.695
If you could just...

55:40.728 --> 55:41.729
Oh.

55:45.532 --> 55:47.000
Cold.

55:47.034 --> 55:48.903
Yeah, I thought we could
all use a little cooling down.

55:48.936 --> 55:51.038
Oh, it's so cold.

55:51.070 --> 55:52.507
Jenna

55:55.976 --> 55:56.845
Heaven, right?

56:54.802 --> 56:57.004
I feel stoned,

56:57.036 --> 56:58.638
so relaxed

56:58.672 --> 57:00.206
and sticky as I've ever been.

57:02.041 --> 57:03.210
I'm gonna have a shower.

57:03.242 --> 57:04.144
Okay.

57:04.177 --> 57:05.946
Oh, you guys starving?

57:07.715 --> 57:08.783
I'll order some food.

57:14.822 --> 57:15.823
You don't smoke.

57:19.793 --> 57:20.662
Now I do.

57:27.668 --> 57:28.736
This turned out nice

57:29.737 --> 57:30.805
with this whole thing.

57:34.875 --> 57:36.878
I can't figure you out,
what's going on?

57:47.086 --> 57:48.088
How come you lied?

57:49.856 --> 57:51.159
What're you talking about?

57:53.092 --> 57:55.163
You've obviously
been sleeping with Mia.

57:59.967 --> 58:00.835
For how long?

58:03.704 --> 58:05.339
I don't, I don't...

58:05.371 --> 58:07.807
You told me that you
don't lie, remember?

58:07.840 --> 58:09.043
Just don't keep doing it.

58:11.277 --> 58:13.947
I told you when we first
met, it really fucks me up.

58:15.048 --> 58:16.250
Babe, I'm really sorry.

58:18.318 --> 58:19.253
I didn't plan for this
to happen, okay?

58:19.286 --> 58:21.088
I didn't plan
to fall for her like I did.

58:21.121 --> 58:22.155
You didn't plan?

58:22.188 --> 58:24.958
You planned this whole
thing to cover your tracks.

58:27.027 --> 58:29.230
Made it seem like
it was our thing

58:29.262 --> 58:30.998
and it's just your thing.

58:32.331 --> 58:33.300
Jenna, I'm sorry.

58:37.403 --> 58:39.273
Sorry I don't know
what else to say.

58:40.840 --> 58:41.708
I'm fucked up.

58:43.043 --> 58:45.146
Why would you
let it get this far?

58:45.179 --> 58:49.115
To meet her, be attracted
to her, have sex with her?

58:49.148 --> 58:50.652
God, you think I'm stupid.

58:51.784 --> 58:52.886
I am stupid.

58:53.887 --> 58:55.722
I shouldn't have done it,
I shouldn't have brought you.

58:55.755 --> 58:58.091
You just thought that
you could keep lying

58:58.125 --> 59:00.327
and she would go to Hawaii
and I would never find out.

59:00.360 --> 59:01.561
No, I didn't think that.

59:01.594 --> 59:04.330
You wouldn't gone
with her if she had asked you.

59:04.364 --> 59:05.800
No, I love you.

59:07.835 --> 59:09.037
Then come home with me.

59:19.179 --> 59:20.815
Wait.

59:20.847 --> 59:22.483
You're attracted to her
too, aren't you?

59:22.516 --> 59:23.784
Of course I am.

59:25.753 --> 59:27.388
Why do you think
I had sex with her?

59:29.123 --> 59:30.825
It wasn't just
to make you happy.

59:32.192 --> 59:34.360
I think you
"like her" like her.

59:34.393 --> 59:36.229
You "love her" love her.

59:41.467 --> 59:43.471
I need to get out of here.

59:43.503 --> 59:44.905
Please don't.

59:49.009 --> 59:50.478
We can talk about this later.

59:50.510 --> 59:51.545
I wanna
talk about it now, Jenna.

59:51.579 --> 59:54.182
I wanna leave before she
gets out of the shower.

59:55.481 --> 59:56.483
I'll be home soon.

59:57.985 --> 59:59.519
Will you come now?

59:59.552 --> 01:00:00.954
No, she's like in the shower.

01:00:00.987 --> 01:00:02.789
It's a little bit weird,
it's rude.

01:00:04.257 --> 01:00:05.292
Don't come home.

01:00:18.237 --> 01:00:19.139
Come on in.

01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:25.179
I just wanted to let
you know I'm taking off.

01:00:26.547 --> 01:00:28.416
Thank you
for a wonderful night, R.S.

01:01:05.318 --> 01:01:06.186
Kate?

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:17.999
Kate?

01:01:23.536 --> 01:01:24.971
Hello?

01:01:25.005 --> 01:01:25.873
In here.

01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:39.018
So Jenna left?

01:01:39.052 --> 01:01:39.921
Yeah.

01:01:42.088 --> 01:01:43.123
Is she okay?

01:01:44.157 --> 01:01:45.026
I don't know.

01:01:46.126 --> 01:01:47.361
Said she didn't feel well.

01:01:51.998 --> 01:01:53.166
I'm bummed she left.

01:01:55.302 --> 01:01:56.170
Yeah.

01:01:58.605 --> 01:01:59.440
Did she...

01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:02.844
say anything about me?

01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:05.078
No.

01:02:13.954 --> 01:02:15.890
I'm still feeling it.

01:02:26.666 --> 01:02:27.869
Oh, jeez.

01:02:30.202 --> 01:02:31.538
Did she not know about us?

01:02:36.275 --> 01:02:37.478
Fuck, Kate.

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:39.246
You said you told her.

01:02:39.278 --> 01:02:40.547
Yeah, well, I didn't.

01:02:42.114 --> 01:02:43.083
She figured it out.

01:02:45.719 --> 01:02:47.288
Jesus, Kate.

01:02:48.722 --> 01:02:49.891
I'm sorry.

01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:54.027
I need some food.

01:02:57.496 --> 01:02:58.465
I'm really sorry.

01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:03.304
If I order some spring
rolls, will you have some?

01:03:03.336 --> 01:03:04.204
Yeah.

01:03:11.143 --> 01:03:12.445
As she traced the pulse

01:03:12.478 --> 01:03:13.614
of the waning affair,

01:03:15.481 --> 01:03:18.217
she was startled
by a strange, new woman

01:03:18.251 --> 01:03:20.688
who was like
a burning cigarette ash

01:03:20.721 --> 01:03:23.391
skittering and glowing in
the road in front of her,

01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:25.626
making her slow down.

01:03:39.172 --> 01:03:40.041
Hey.

01:03:41.074 --> 01:03:41.943
It's me.

01:03:44.411 --> 01:03:46.280
I'm so sorry, Jenna.

01:03:52.719 --> 01:03:55.356
If I can
talk to you tomorrow maybe.

01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:00.360
I love you.

01:04:10.237 --> 01:04:12.139
Hey, could I get
chicken fried rice

01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:13.340
and spring rolls please.

01:04:15.742 --> 01:04:17.278
No, no, that's just for one.

01:04:20.146 --> 01:04:21.014
Thank you.

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:39.166
Hello, again.

01:04:39.199 --> 01:04:40.233
Weird.

01:04:40.266 --> 01:04:42.535
I don't think I've ever
had the same driver twice.

01:04:42.568 --> 01:04:43.771
I'm Yuka.

01:04:43.804 --> 01:04:46.106
Nice to meet you again.

01:04:46.139 --> 01:04:47.141
Have a good night?

01:04:48.275 --> 01:04:49.677
I don't know what I just had.

01:04:50.577 --> 01:04:51.779
Fair enough.

01:04:51.811 --> 01:04:52.679
Ready then?

01:04:53.579 --> 01:04:54.447
Sure.

01:05:07.793 --> 01:05:08.761
- So...
- You can stay if you want

01:05:08.795 --> 01:05:11.766
but if you need to go
to her, you should go.

01:05:13.132 --> 01:05:13.800
I don't.

01:05:16.436 --> 01:05:17.304
Okay, well,

01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:19.440
I'm gonna go outside
and grab a smoke.

01:06:10.623 --> 01:06:12.725
Listen, I'd really
like to see you again.

01:06:13.726 --> 01:06:14.594
Just you

01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:19.467
and if you want to come to
Hawaii, I can buy you a ticket.

01:06:20.233 --> 01:06:22.302
Maybe I can help you
with your novel.

01:06:23.802 --> 01:06:25.338
Or you can help me with mine.

01:06:27.806 --> 01:06:29.509
Anyway, you have my number,

01:06:31.545 --> 01:06:32.413
so call me.

01:06:45.224 --> 01:06:47.260
Can we pull over really fast?

01:06:47.293 --> 01:06:48.862
Yeah, of course.

01:06:48.894 --> 01:06:49.730
Do you need help?

01:06:49.762 --> 01:06:51.197
Just two minutes please.

01:06:51.231 --> 01:06:52.599
Okay.

01:07:00.306 --> 01:07:02.742
Oh God, it's fine, you can go.

01:07:02.775 --> 01:07:03.676
I'm okay.

01:07:04.844 --> 01:07:06.480
You're my last ride.

01:07:06.512 --> 01:07:08.514
I'm in no hurry to get home.

01:07:08.547 --> 01:07:09.682
Yeah, me neither.

01:07:13.719 --> 01:07:15.254
Could you get my bag then?

01:07:15.288 --> 01:07:16.356
Of course.

01:07:16.389 --> 01:07:17.391
Thank you.

01:07:24.231 --> 01:07:24.899
Thank you.

01:07:27.467 --> 01:07:30.871
Last week I picked up a
guy who just got married.

01:07:30.903 --> 01:07:32.105
He was smashed.

01:07:32.139 --> 01:07:35.909
Had me pick him up way down
the street from his reception.

01:07:35.942 --> 01:07:37.244
Where was the bride?

01:07:38.711 --> 01:07:41.681
He saw her kissing the
best man in the parking lot.

01:07:41.715 --> 01:07:43.584
He hoped he could go home,
pass out

01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:45.452
and not remember it
when he woke up.

01:07:46.418 --> 01:07:47.587
He was a descent guy.

01:07:48.454 --> 01:07:49.623
I hope it worked out.

01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:50.657
That's sweet.

01:07:56.463 --> 01:07:57.364
Your girlfriend?

01:07:59.298 --> 01:08:00.199
She's in love with

01:08:00.233 --> 01:08:03.737
the woman we slept with
tonight turns out.

01:08:05.804 --> 01:08:07.873
You wanna talk about it?

01:08:07.907 --> 01:08:09.543
I don't wanna throw up again.

01:08:09.576 --> 01:08:11.512
I'll be quiet
until you feel better.

01:08:17.582 --> 01:08:20.019
Actually, could you
tell me a story?

01:08:20.051 --> 01:08:21.688
Whatever.

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.957
What you did
last Tuesday, anything.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:25.823
Well,

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:28.962
Tuesday I took my bike
to get fixed.

01:08:28.993 --> 01:08:31.296
I got a new front tire
because someone stole it

01:08:31.331 --> 01:08:32.666
when it was locked up
on the street.

01:08:32.698 --> 01:08:33.733
I hate that.

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:35.969
So I went to
a donut shop to wait

01:08:36.002 --> 01:08:38.272
and I had some coffee...

01:08:38.305 --> 01:08:39.840
Wait, what color
was your bike?

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:40.740
Red.

01:08:41.939 --> 01:08:43.344
I was picturing blue.

01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:46.880
I'm sorry, go on.

01:08:46.912 --> 01:08:50.383
So I had some coffee and
a chocolate cake donut.

01:08:50.417 --> 01:08:54.321
I read "Savage Love" and I
made a dentist appointment

01:08:54.354 --> 01:08:56.456
but they didn't have an
opening for three weeks

01:08:56.488 --> 01:08:57.390
and I was glad.

01:09:01.426 --> 01:09:02.296
Thank you.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.505
Maybe a little walk will help?

01:09:11.537 --> 01:09:13.006
Yeah, that would be nice.

01:09:36.395 --> 01:09:37.063
Wow.

01:09:57.884 --> 01:09:58.752
Still here?

01:10:00.119 --> 01:10:00.988
Yeah.

01:10:02.956 --> 01:10:04.490
I guess that's
a good sign.

01:10:08.994 --> 01:10:09.863
Come here.

01:10:12.564 --> 01:10:15.001
We have a little bit of time
before the food gets here.

01:10:25.511 --> 01:10:26.380
I...

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.917
I need to call off the bet,
I think.

01:10:57.844 --> 01:10:58.746
Home now?

01:11:00.747 --> 01:11:01.882
Not ready to go home.

01:11:03.783 --> 01:11:04.851
Breakfast?

01:11:04.884 --> 01:11:06.520
Food would be good.

01:11:06.552 --> 01:11:08.889
Yes, I know a good place.

01:11:08.921 --> 01:11:09.956
Okay.
