00:06.073 --> 00:08.747
In New York City war on crime,

00:08.775 --> 00:11.688
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:11.712 --> 00:14.192
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.214 --> 00:16.193
These are their stories.

00:18.986 --> 00:21.091
Woman: Make a left up here at this light.

00:21.121 --> 00:24.694
We're driving in circles.
You think that's going to fool me?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.499
You know how Erica feels about her privacy.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.373
Why? You ever ask yourself that?

00:31.398 --> 00:33.844
I don't need to.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.713
Now pull up to this driveway on the left.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.412
Erica is just real upset about this, Doug.

00:41.441 --> 00:45.548
I mean, think about it. It's as big an
insult as you can give another person.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.116
If that's the way she feels,
she can tell me to my face.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.185
I deserve at least that much.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.755
It's making her sick, on top of
everything she has to deal with.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.064
I just want to talk to her. She agreed!

00:57.090 --> 00:59.593
Man: You’re going to talk to her.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.936
She said she'd talk to you, didn't she?

01:01.962 --> 01:04.203
Then what's the problem?

01:04.230 --> 01:06.370
She wants you to sign something.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.381
What kind of a game is this?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.478
You come here, you make all your demands.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.547
You want to talk to her, you just sign that.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.560
This is ridiculous! I'm out of here.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.856
Are you threatening me?

01:24.885 --> 01:27.695
Please, we're only making
things worse for Erica.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.395
He's the one making the problems.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.495
I came all the way out here to see her

01:32.526 --> 01:34.972
and now you're laying this crap on me?

01:34.995 --> 01:36.633
You bet I'm going to make problems!

01:36.663 --> 01:40.201
I'll talk to her. Toby, you too.

01:40.233 --> 01:43.112
Why are you being so difficult?

01:43.136 --> 01:44.979
Don't be a fool, Christine.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.849
This whole house of cards is coming down.

01:47.874 --> 01:50.286
I gave all of you, your opportunity.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.553
Douglas-- Get yourself a lawyer.

01:54.848 --> 01:58.819
Erica is extremely...
disappointed in you, Doug.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.423
Do I get to talk to her or not?

02:01.455 --> 02:05.062
Go home. She just wants you to go home.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.907
Maybe if I talk to her?

02:14.935 --> 02:19.179
Erica says we have to let him
do whatever he needs to do.

02:19.206 --> 02:22.779
You can't stop someone
from walking into their own hell.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.990
Hey, it's 5:00-something. Let's go.

02:30.017 --> 02:34.090
This guy, you should have heard him.
More rules than the NFL playbook.

02:34.121 --> 02:38.035
I'm like, "Why do you have to make
it so complicated, you fat moron?"

02:38.058 --> 02:40.800
Last time I checked,
all the parts fit together.

02:40.827 --> 02:44.001
You don't have to be so damn complicated."

02:44.031 --> 02:45.601
- ( dull bang )
- Oh, my God!

02:45.632 --> 02:48.044
( women screaming )

02:49.036 --> 02:50.879
Fire! Help!

02:50.904 --> 02:54.511
Help! There’s somebody on
fire here! Call 911!

02:55.509 --> 02:59.855
( theme music plays )

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:43.423 --> 03:46.802
The fire set off this can of butane
in Mr. Lafferty's coat pocket.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.431
That accounted for the fireball.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.567
The fire died down pretty quickly.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.101
"Lucy Hotpants" there, thinks the
guy died of spontaneous combustion.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.512
Right after he's "spontaneously"
hit in the head.

03:56.536 --> 03:59.517
I count three impact wounds
on the right side of his skull.

03:59.539 --> 04:02.145
- What started the fire?
- They put a match to his coat.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.748
Fire marshal said it smelled
like it was soaked with acetone.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.692
- Nail polish remover.
- His wallet's missing.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.218
We had ID'd him off his press
badge in the glove box.

04:11.251 --> 04:15.757
There's blood and scalp tissue on the tip.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.101
The perp was seated here...

04:21.128 --> 04:24.234
And rammed it into his head.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.143
He wasn't murdered in this location.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.842
This blood stain didn't spatter
here when he was killed.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.852
It most likely came

04:33.874 --> 04:37.117
when his head was resting against the door.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.955
His body was moved into the
passenger seat after he was killed.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.224
The killer then drove him here,

04:44.251 --> 04:48.427
put him back behind the wheel...

04:56.396 --> 04:58.535
...set him on fire

04:58.565 --> 05:01.375
to destroy evidence he was killed elsewhere.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.506
Eames: "Elsewhere," where?

05:03.537 --> 05:06.017
We start where he started.
There's a garage-door opener

05:06.039 --> 05:08.679
on the end of his keychain.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.815
( police radio chatter )

05:13.847 --> 05:16.384
Looks like part of the umbrella.

05:16.416 --> 05:20.091
Probably fell out of the car
when the killer got out.

05:29.596 --> 05:33.408
Make-up products. I need a bag.

05:33.433 --> 05:37.108
Nail polish, emery boards,

05:37.137 --> 05:40.346
manicure clippers...

05:44.211 --> 05:46.885
Everything but nail polish remover.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.655
Looks like he was killed in the garage.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.632
Somebody defragged his
computer to wipe out files.

05:54.654 --> 05:56.793
The family silver's all accounted for,

05:56.823 --> 06:01.101
including Mr. Lafferty's
gold watches and diamond cufflinks.

06:01.127 --> 06:04.404
And Pulitzer Prize...

06:04.431 --> 06:08.106
For his coverage of the Tet Offensive in 1968.

06:08.134 --> 06:11.445
This guy was a war correspondent

06:11.471 --> 06:13.144
before he owned a magazine.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.244
Tough old bird.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.221
News magazines.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.092
News magazines.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.257
No hobbies, no special interests.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.427
I spoke too soon.

06:30.457 --> 06:34.633
It's a catalog for medical equipment.

06:34.661 --> 06:38.006
Probably for his late wife.
She died last year.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.511
He still keeps her things in the garage.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.537
Tough, sentimental old bird.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.279
Maybe not that sentimental-- his bank
statements for the last three months.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.617
He was withdrawing cash
on a regular basis--

06:49.643 --> 06:52.886
big chunks-- $7 grand, $10 grand--

06:52.913 --> 06:55.655
he found himself a high maintenance hobby.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.423
$116 grand in the last six months to who?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.160
A bookie, a girlfriend?
The guy was a lonely widower.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.327
If he had a girlfriend,
we couldn't find any trace of her.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.496
His address book and
appointment book are missing,

07:06.526 --> 07:08.528
his computer disc was wiped clean.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.837
We're still waiting on his phone records.

07:10.864 --> 07:13.674
You don't like the girlfriend angle?

07:13.700 --> 07:16.044
I'm open to anything.

07:16.069 --> 07:19.278
Let's say the perpetrator was a woman.

07:19.306 --> 07:23.618
She had excellent improvisational skills.

07:23.643 --> 07:26.715
She created an incendiary device,

07:26.746 --> 07:29.818
she relocated the body to a high crime area.

07:29.849 --> 07:33.558
For all the good it did her, she might
as well have left him in the garage.

07:36.089 --> 07:38.296
That's the point.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.905
She over thought the event.

07:45.498 --> 07:48.672
She was careful but almost...

07:48.702 --> 07:51.148
Neurotically anxious...

07:51.171 --> 07:53.651
About hiding her tracks.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.215
Lafferty might have been
the target of her anger,

07:58.244 --> 08:01.088
but he wasn't the object of her passion.

08:01.114 --> 08:04.561
She wasn't emotionally involved...

08:04.584 --> 08:07.224
With him.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.824
She was emotionally involved
with his bank account.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.836
Lafferty had two kids, right?

08:11.858 --> 08:14.737
A son and daughter. They're
coming in for the ID.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.906
I invited him to join my wife
and some friends for dinner,

08:19.933 --> 08:21.935
but he wanted to stay in.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.505
Did you suspect he had other plans?

08:25.872 --> 08:28.876
Since Mom died, Dad's
been a little difficult.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.252
He's been grieving.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.025
Ms. Lafferty, any time you want to jump in.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.065
It's obvious, isn't it?

08:45.091 --> 08:49.062
Look at where you found
my father-- on 11th Avenue.

08:49.095 --> 08:52.269
- He turned into a sex addict.
- Lafferty: She's right.

08:52.298 --> 08:56.110
A couple of weeks ago,
I was in Bulgari's, with my kids,

08:56.136 --> 08:59.049
shopping for Mother's Day.
Dad was at the jewelry counter.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.018
Did you talk to him?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.386
Yes. He wasn't too happy to see me.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.324
As soon as the salesperson
came back with his receipt, he left.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.794
I thought he was buying
jewelry for some girlfriend.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.297
Did you see what he bought?

09:13.319 --> 09:16.095
No.

09:16.122 --> 09:19.535
The salesperson told him to come
back and pick it up in a week.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.335
He was having it inscribed.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.707
Mr. Lafferty bought a lady's watch in gold.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.942
Lucky lady. He had some engraving done?

09:30.970 --> 09:33.007
It's on the next page.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.952
"To Erica for giving me
a reason to go on. Douglas."

09:35.975 --> 09:38.046
So romantic, don't you think?

09:38.078 --> 09:40.820
You don't want to know what I think.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.521
- Which model is it?
- This one.

09:50.056 --> 09:53.196
This watch has a clasp on the band.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.399
It says on the receipt that Mr. Lafferty

09:55.428 --> 09:58.272
switched it with an expansion band.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.938
It's easier to take on and off.
He said that the lady

10:00.967 --> 10:04.244
might find a band with a clasp
too difficult to use.

10:04.270 --> 10:07.843
I think she had a little
handicap with her right hand.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.945
Thank you very much.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.013
We're going to Queens.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.355
The medical equipment
catalog in Lafferty's den--

10:14.380 --> 10:17.259
that's where they have their store.

10:17.283 --> 10:20.196
Woman: Erica needs more. We have to move.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.360
Rethink this, Barb, please, for Erica's sake?

10:23.389 --> 10:25.494
We know what's best.

10:25.525 --> 10:28.938
I don't know how we're
going to make do with this.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.101
Tell me where you're going.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.168
I'll see what I can do.

10:34.667 --> 10:39.241
I'll tell Erica. I know
you're trying to help.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.513
She'll call you, okay?

10:48.982 --> 10:53.624
We supplied Mr. Lafferty with a
wheelchair when his wife was sick.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.031
Then three months ago he ordered another one.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.433
It had to be motorized
with a joystick control.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.404
- A left-handed joystick?
- Yes.

11:00.426 --> 11:03.464
The young lady had lost
the use of her right hand.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.238
He said she might eventually
need a mouth-control stick.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.439
Where were you supposed
to deliver the wheelchair?

11:08.468 --> 11:11.312
To an Erica Windemere.
I don't have the address.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.046
Mr. Lafferty was going to tell me when
he came in to make the last payment.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.350
It's been ready now for three weeks.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.989
This chair's for a child.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.087
Mr. Lafferty said she's 14
and weighs only 90 pounds.

11:25.118 --> 11:29.498
The new love of his life--
a little girl in a wheelchair.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.871
Wheelchair, respirator, heart monitor.

11:38.898 --> 11:41.469
Over $30,000 total, just in medical supplies.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.072
- Who is this girl, a relative?
- His kids have never heard of her.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.549
She's somebody he met in the last six months.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.246
Maybe he's involved with her mother.

11:48.274 --> 11:51.255
Goren: It's about what was
inscribed on the watch.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.484
His wife is dead, his kids don't like him.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.892
Helping this girl filled a void in his life.

11:56.916 --> 11:59.021
( elevator bell rings )
His phone records came in this morning.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.259
No calls to anyone named Windemere,

12:01.287 --> 12:03.893
but a lot of calls to numbers that
never showed up before six months ago.

12:03.923 --> 12:06.369
Check them out.

12:07.360 --> 12:10.034
I was blown away when I heard
what happened to Doug.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.100
He's just such a decent guy.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.906
Where did you know him from?

12:13.933 --> 12:16.777
We had, you know, common interests.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.750
- You mean Erica?
- You know Erica?

12:19.772 --> 12:21.911
We're trying to get in touch with her.

12:21.941 --> 12:25.514
Just leave a message for her
on the web site-- "Erica W."

12:25.545 --> 12:27.786
There's a chat room and everything.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.691
That's how I met Doug.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.718
We need to actually talk to her.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.662
I can't help you with that.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.688
You're worried about Erica? So are we.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.998
She's already been through a lot.

12:38.024 --> 12:39.935
I mean, you read the book.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.769
Yeah, sure-- the book. My partner hasn't.

12:42.795 --> 12:45.537
You should. It's so right on.

12:45.565 --> 12:49.536
He's been after me to get into it.
What's it called again?

12:49.569 --> 12:51.947
"Through The Darkness."

12:51.971 --> 12:55.180
What did you like most about it?

12:55.208 --> 12:56.881
She never gives up.

12:56.909 --> 13:00.049
My sister died of breast cancer 3 years ago.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.355
She left behind two kids.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.919
Erica's book helps me to talk to them.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.397
You've got to read it, okay?

13:12.225 --> 13:15.331
Since it came out last fall, it's
been one of our biggest sellers,

13:15.361 --> 13:18.672
which surprised me.
It was pretty raw when we got it.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.235
Thank God for editors.
( knocks )

13:21.267 --> 13:23.406
Christine?

13:23.436 --> 13:26.849
These detectives need some
information about Erica Windemere.

13:26.873 --> 13:30.047
Oh, one of my favorite authors.
How can I help you?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.522
We're investigating the murder
of Douglas Lafferty.

13:32.545 --> 13:36.516
Oh, yes. In fact, Erica
e-mailed me yesterday,

13:36.549 --> 13:39.655
telling me how upset she was about his death.

13:39.686 --> 13:42.394
- They were good friends?
- Yeah, she was very fond of him.

13:42.422 --> 13:46.131
I just got the book.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.833
- Oh, so she has ALS?
- Christine: Yes.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.104
"Lou Gehrig's Disease." That's degenerative.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.712
"Your body is destroyed...

13:56.736 --> 13:59.239
...while your soul stays intact."

13:59.272 --> 14:02.276
That's what it says here on the cover.

14:02.308 --> 14:06.723
That's the least of which she's had to face
in her short life. She could teach us a lot.

14:06.746 --> 14:10.250
And we have a lot to learn.
We need her address and phone number.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.924
You know she's just a bedridden little girl?

14:13.953 --> 14:17.526
Well, she might know something
she doesn't even know she knows.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.867
She sounds like the kind
of person who'd want to help.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.272
Yeah. I don't have a phone number for her,

14:23.296 --> 14:25.367
but I can give you her e-mail.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.713
Is that how you worked on the book
with her-- through her e-mails?

14:31.738 --> 14:33.649
Yes, and she calls me.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.778
She can't give out her address or her phone.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.288
The book explains why.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.520
How about her book royalties?
How do you get the checks to her?

14:41.547 --> 14:44.391
Her foster mother, Barb, comes to the office.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.260
Eames: She doesn't live with her parents?

14:46.285 --> 14:48.492
No. Child Welfare took her from them.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.899
Is there a foster father?

14:50.923 --> 14:53.426
There's Toby, he's the physical therapist.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.900
And she has you.

14:58.164 --> 15:00.701
I'm sorry for all the secrecy.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.043
It's just that's it's the only way
to protect Erica's safety.

15:03.069 --> 15:07.142
You really do need to read the book.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.881
Okay, thanks. Two days for the
subpoena, a couple of more days

15:09.909 --> 15:12.389
for the e-mail account information.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.690
Probably another dead end.
This kid doesn't want to be found.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.357
She writes she's been dodging death threats.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.925
Her parents were members of a violent
drug gang that sexually abused her.

15:25.958 --> 15:29.531
Sexually abusing a kid with ALS. Lovely.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.442
No, before the ALS kicked in at age 11.

15:33.466 --> 15:37.437
Her father is serving
10 years for the sex abuse.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.349
Her mother vowed to kill her
if she ever finds her.

15:40.373 --> 15:43.513
What are you writing?
I'm sending her an e-mail.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.614
That's how everybody else
gets her attention.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.148
"Dear Erica, I've just
finished reading your book.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.252
I've met a lot of people in my line of work,

15:50.283 --> 15:53.355
but I've never met anyone with your courage
and power to forgive." You get the idea?

15:53.386 --> 15:57.857
And then I tell her I want to talk to her
about Lafferty and I include my phone number.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.063
While you're waiting for an answer,

16:00.092 --> 16:02.163
let's see if Child Welfare knows where she is.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.311
Child Welfare has no
record of a girl with ALS

16:08.334 --> 16:10.507
going through their system
in the last 5 years,

16:10.536 --> 16:14.143
no record of a girl being used
as a sex toy by a dope gang,

16:14.173 --> 16:17.950
no record of foster parents
named "Barb" and "Toby."

16:17.977 --> 16:21.151
But people have talked to this girl, right?
The editor of the book?

16:21.180 --> 16:24.127
We found a few people through her web
site who said they got calls from her.

16:24.150 --> 16:26.323
They all described the same thing--

16:26.352 --> 16:29.595
a sweet girl with a bad disease
and a positive attitude.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.296
(phone rings)

16:32.325 --> 16:34.396
Captain Deakins.

16:40.132 --> 16:43.670
Erica Windemere-- for you.
You want to take it here?

16:48.307 --> 16:52.619
Hello, Erica? This is
Detective Alexandra Eames.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.955
- Hello, Detective.
- Call me Alex.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.985
( breathy voice )
Am I on speakerphone, Alex?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.588
Yes. I'm here with my boss, Captain Deakins

17:00.620 --> 17:02.793
and my partner, Detective Goren.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.425
We're all anxious to speak with you.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.563
Okay. I was so glad you wrote me.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.574
If there's any way I can help,
of course I want to do that.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.202
When was the last time
you spoke with Mr. Lafferty?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.304
We spoke all the time about his children.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.044
He wanted to have a better
relationship with them.

17:20.071 --> 17:22.643
And he was such a big support to me.

17:22.675 --> 17:26.145
Erica, is there any way that we could meet

17:26.178 --> 17:28.624
and talk to you in person?

17:28.648 --> 17:33.393
(whimpering) it depends on my health.
I've had so many bad days lately.

17:35.121 --> 17:39.092
- Alex, do you have any kids?
- No.

17:39.125 --> 17:43.164
Your voice reminds me
of my kindergarten teacher.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.835
It's a very warm voice,

17:45.865 --> 17:49.074
like you spend a lot of time talking to kids.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.877
I hope you have some someday.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.343
Erica...

17:55.374 --> 17:58.287
Your book says you contracted ALS

17:58.311 --> 18:00.621
when you were just 11.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.819
That's pretty rare, isn't it?

18:02.848 --> 18:05.294
Yes.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.662
Goren: You still have the
use of your right hand?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.099
No, I don't.

18:10.122 --> 18:12.261
But you have the use of your left hand?

18:12.291 --> 18:14.328
Yes.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.307
That kind of asymmetric disability

18:17.330 --> 18:20.868
is unusual for ALS sufferers,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.675
isn’t it?

18:22.702 --> 18:24.807
I don't know what "usual" is.

18:24.837 --> 18:28.808
What's happening to me
is what's usual for me.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.285
One more thing.

18:34.313 --> 18:38.193
How has ALS affected your menstruation?

18:40.419 --> 18:44.196
( stammers )
I-- you mean--

18:44.223 --> 18:46.965
I don't want to embarrass you.

18:46.993 --> 18:48.995
In your book, you're very frank

18:49.028 --> 18:51.406
about your development as a young woman.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.036
- ( Erica stammering )
- Goren: If it makes you uncomfortable--

18:54.066 --> 18:56.342
It's not that.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.248
How has your condition affected you?

18:59.271 --> 19:01.182
( falters )
I --

19:01.207 --> 19:03.653
Is this something that
you have to think about?

19:03.676 --> 19:07.249
I can't believe I'm being
attacked like this.

19:07.279 --> 19:11.250
Alex, people can't destroy you
unless you let them.

19:11.283 --> 19:14.059
( crying, handset clatters )

19:15.054 --> 19:17.056
Angry woman: What did you
people say to Erica?

19:17.089 --> 19:21.037
- Who's this?
- This is her foster mother.

19:21.060 --> 19:24.872
Erica's crying right now. How
could you people take five minutes

19:24.897 --> 19:27.104
of whatever precious time
she has left on this planet

19:27.133 --> 19:30.012
to do this to her? Shame on you!

19:30.036 --> 19:33.916
( hangs up, dial tone hums )

19:39.912 --> 19:41.789
( tone off )

19:41.814 --> 19:44.124
If I hadn't heard it with my own ears--

19:44.150 --> 19:46.824
Well, it was a legitimate question.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.458
She was just trying to come up
with the right answer.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.966
The right answer is whatever's
happening to her body.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.942
She shouldn't have to think about it.

20:04.770 --> 20:08.377
That's why Doug Lafferty never took
delivery of the wheelchair--

20:12.144 --> 20:14.488
she's a fake...

20:14.513 --> 20:17.983
And he found out.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.995
I remember my wife telling me about this book.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.131
It made some talk show
book club selection.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.232
They called her "the next Anne Frank."

20:31.263 --> 20:33.402
Except Anne Frank actually existed.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.743
- No one's ever met this girl?
- Goren: Maybe someone has.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.545
This is from the introduction
by Professor David Cantler.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.212
"Erica's easy smile

20:42.241 --> 20:46.189
hides a will of iron which refuses
to succumb to the ravages of life."

20:46.212 --> 20:49.159
Her "easy smile" wouldn't be
easy to see over the telephone.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.821
Cantler-- the geneticist with the bestseller?

20:51.851 --> 20:53.922
Two bestsellers and four wives.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.024
Apparently the professor likes the ladies...

20:56.055 --> 20:58.092
And vice-a versa.

20:58.124 --> 21:02.300
You know us-- we like men who play
with the building blocks of life.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.271
- Eames: Professor Cantler?
- Hello.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.871
I'm a graduate, sorry.

21:10.903 --> 21:14.749
Alex Eames-- in social work.
I'm a graduate student.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.344
What can I do for you, Alex Eames?

21:16.375 --> 21:19.413
My thesis is on survivors of child sex abuse

21:19.445 --> 21:21.584
and I know you wrote the introduction to...

21:21.614 --> 21:24.094
"Through the Darkness"? Yes.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.153
You see, I want to interview
Erica for my thesis

21:26.185 --> 21:28.324
and if you could help me...

21:28.354 --> 21:30.561
Well, I have a confession to make.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.001
It wasn't possible to actually meet with her.

21:33.025 --> 21:36.563
- But your introduction?
- Yes, I know. A little poetic license.

21:36.595 --> 21:39.974
I went to meet her, but her health was so
fragile she just wasn't strong enough.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.139
But you got to see where she lived?
Yes, I did that, but--

21:43.169 --> 21:45.410
My thesis partner.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.246
Hi.

21:47.273 --> 21:50.482
I'm Detective Robert Goren. How you doing?

21:50.509 --> 21:53.820
Did Alex mention she's a detective, too?

21:53.846 --> 21:55.917
And her "thesis"? That's actually a subpoena

21:55.948 --> 22:00.124
that we need to serve on Erica
and her foster parents.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.662
Er, look, I actually don't
know where she lives.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.967
They had me drive out
to a gas station on Long Island

22:07.993 --> 22:10.064
and this man, Toby, picked me up

22:10.095 --> 22:12.097
and drove me around in his van
for about half an hour.

22:12.131 --> 22:14.202
Eames: You know what the
house looks like, right?

22:14.233 --> 22:16.474
We'll just drive around until we find it.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.318
There's still food in the fridge.

22:22.341 --> 22:25.481
Whoever lived here must have just moved out.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.787
Gravel from the driveway.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.293
I waited to meet with Erica
right here in this living room.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.354
She was in the bedroom.
She was too sick to come out.

22:33.385 --> 22:37.060
"Hook, line and sinker," Professor.
I can't believe you fell for this.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.662
Erica exists. She's a gentle loving soul

22:40.693 --> 22:43.037
who's been through great trials
in her very fragile life.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.269
I've spoken to her many times.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.800
On the phone.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.178
You’re a scientist.

22:51.203 --> 22:54.741
I don't have to stick my fingers in
the wounds to believe, Detective.

22:54.773 --> 22:58.152
There's a theorem-- Godel's
Great Incompleteness Theorem.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.316
"Every axiomatic system
will contain truths..."

23:00.346 --> 23:02.485
"That cannot be proven."

23:02.514 --> 23:07.054
"But the absence of proof can be proof."

23:08.053 --> 23:10.055
This was Erica's bedroom?

23:15.327 --> 23:17.603
The bed was in here?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.632
I don't see any marks

23:19.665 --> 23:21.941
or indentations on the carpet,

23:21.967 --> 23:25.073
- or the wall. Do you?
- That's not conclusive.

23:25.104 --> 23:29.553
I don't see a 220-volt hook-up

23:29.575 --> 23:34.115
for the respirator
Doug Lafferty bought for Erica.

23:37.349 --> 23:40.489
Doug Lafferty bought her a respirator?

23:42.087 --> 23:44.567
And you bought her one too, didn't you?

23:45.557 --> 23:50.097
I'm sure they made a nice
profit selling the equipment.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.905
I've been a fool.

23:54.400 --> 24:00.476
Wanting to help someone is not foolish.

24:00.506 --> 24:04.283
But now you have to help us find these people.

24:05.744 --> 24:08.020
There's a pharmacy--

24:08.047 --> 24:10.687
sometimes they ask me
to pay for her prescriptions.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.457
Goren: I'm a friend of David Cantler's.

24:16.488 --> 24:19.867
He was supposed to drop off some
money for a kid's prescription--

24:19.892 --> 24:22.805
Erica Windemere? He asked
me to take care of it.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.899
Is that okay?

24:24.930 --> 24:27.501
Sure, I guess so. How much is it?

24:27.533 --> 24:28.944
Let's see. She's on the Rilutek,

24:28.968 --> 24:33.110
in addition to the Zanaflex and the Roxanol.
That's $800 for all three.

24:33.138 --> 24:35.277
$800?

24:35.307 --> 24:37.446
This girl never heard of medical insurance?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.979
Doesn't have any. That's all I know.

24:41.947 --> 24:45.190
I don't mean to be rude, but how do I know

24:45.217 --> 24:48.755
you're going to actually send her the drugs?

24:49.755 --> 24:52.429
We do this all the time.
Somebody pays for the drugs

24:52.458 --> 24:54.961
and I call Erica's foster mother
to come get them.

24:56.395 --> 25:00.138
Can you show me Erica's
prescriptions for the drugs?

25:00.165 --> 25:02.372
Why would I want to do that?

25:02.401 --> 25:05.143
Because I'm a cop.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.411
And you're five seconds away
from being arrested

25:07.439 --> 25:10.113
for selling prescription drugs
without a prescription.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.146
( stammers ) I--just pass it on to
Barb for Erica. It's a donation.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.250
After you take a handling fee?

25:18.150 --> 25:20.255
Okay, Murray, this is
what you're going to do.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.424
You're going to call Barb

25:22.454 --> 25:25.025
and tell her a big donation just came in

25:25.057 --> 25:28.095
and that you need her
to come by before you close.

25:30.963 --> 25:34.570
Have you ever seen her?
Have you, Christine?

25:34.600 --> 25:36.671
I've never seen JD Salinger either,

25:36.702 --> 25:39.342
but that doesn't make me
doubt his existence.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.248
Go ahead and be flip.
I'm telling you if you publish

25:41.273 --> 25:45.085
any further editions of the book,
I want my introduction excised.

25:45.110 --> 25:49.081
This is happening because of Barb.
She's too overprotective.

25:49.114 --> 25:51.651
Erica would be happy to meet with
people if Barb would let her.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.596
Christine, you got taken,
and I got taken.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.691
Now, let's just hope
when this hits the papers

25:56.722 --> 25:59.168
we don't look like total idiots.
I'll tell you what I hope.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.967
I hope that I never lose faith
in one of the kindest,

26:01.994 --> 26:05.737
most spiritual human beings
I have ever met.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.973
I feel sorry for you.
Feel sorry for yourself!

26:09.001 --> 26:11.572
( glass breaks )

26:11.603 --> 26:14.914
You're not just betraying Erica,
you're betraying all children!

26:19.645 --> 26:22.592
Erica is safe where we left her--

26:22.614 --> 26:24.685
with friends.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.196
We found your motel room.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.358
There were none of Erica's
personal belongings there.

26:29.388 --> 26:31.595
Not even a picture of her.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.433
Barb: We know what she looks like.
We don't need a picture of her.

26:34.460 --> 26:37.634
And all of her things are with her.

26:37.663 --> 26:40.940
Toby's in the next room.
You sure he's telling the same story?

26:40.966 --> 26:44.311
Yes, I'm sure, because it's the truth.

26:44.336 --> 26:46.612
What's wrong with you
that makes you want to destroy

26:46.638 --> 26:49.619
someone good like Erica?

26:51.110 --> 26:53.215
( chuckles )

26:53.245 --> 26:56.249
I'm just a natural born skeptic.

26:57.850 --> 27:01.297
Maybe I haven't had enough
tragedy in my life-- like Doug.

27:01.320 --> 27:04.028
His wife is gone,

27:04.056 --> 27:06.969
his kids hate him,

27:06.992 --> 27:09.768
death staring him in the face.

27:09.795 --> 27:14.005
Doug was full of love.
Erica opened his heart.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.841
Eames:
Not to mention his wallet.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.041
I'm not even going to speak to that.

27:18.070 --> 27:20.141
( bag crinkles )

27:20.172 --> 27:22.743
Doug had doubts.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.277
( rattling )

27:25.310 --> 27:27.153
Huh?

27:27.179 --> 27:29.181
Isn't that why...

27:29.214 --> 27:32.388
He was at the house...

27:35.521 --> 27:38.832
The night that he died?

27:38.857 --> 27:41.770
( rattling )

27:43.395 --> 27:46.001
He wasn't there.

27:47.566 --> 27:49.705
This is gravel--

27:51.370 --> 27:53.509
from your driveway.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.913
Gravel --

27:59.044 --> 28:03.891
it gets around, all the way to Manhattan.

28:06.051 --> 28:09.191
This is the same kind of gravel.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.168
We found it in the tires of Doug's car.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.273
He did come out that night.

28:23.302 --> 28:26.840
He and Erica needed to talk, and they did.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.409
Well, now we know one thing--
you're not above lying to us.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.513
I'll do whatever I need to protect Erica.

28:32.544 --> 28:36.219
Including killing an old man
who threatens to destroy you?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.853
People can't destroy you unless you let them.

28:39.885 --> 28:42.525
I've heard that before...

28:42.554 --> 28:45.558
From Erica.

28:49.127 --> 28:51.937
- Did she teach you that?
- Yes, she did.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.877
Strength of character, strength of will.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.609
These are the tools you've been given
to make yourself what you would be.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.982
And you made Erica

29:03.008 --> 29:05.079
into what you'd like yourself to be?

29:05.110 --> 29:07.784
Erica made herself.

29:07.813 --> 29:11.386
I was just lucky enough to
meet her in her time of need.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.293
( laughs )

29:13.318 --> 29:17.528
You're quick. Just like Erica.

29:21.159 --> 29:24.106
Do you ever get jealous about all
the attention that she gets?

29:24.129 --> 29:26.234
No.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.711
Because some of it falls on you, right?

29:29.868 --> 29:33.213
I'm just there to help Erica.

29:34.606 --> 29:38.554
And you take care of Erica,
and you control access to Erica.

29:38.577 --> 29:42.855
That makes you a very important person.

29:46.351 --> 29:49.594
Isn't that what this is really about?

29:51.156 --> 29:52.294
( door opens )

29:52.324 --> 29:55.498
Mr. Jacobs here has been hired
to represent the Windemeres.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.547
Goren: Now some people pretend to be sick

30:06.571 --> 30:09.347
for the, attention, the love.

30:11.877 --> 30:14.881
Some women, they make their
children sick for the same reason.

30:14.913 --> 30:17.917
Some women kill their babies.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.128
But this woman,

30:22.154 --> 30:27.001
she invented a sick child

30:27.025 --> 30:29.335
for the attention, for the love.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.773
But if somebody like Doug
Lafferty gets in the way--

30:31.797 --> 30:33.902
No, she's not violent.

30:33.932 --> 30:37.539
No, she believes

30:37.569 --> 30:39.105
that she can talk her way out of anything.

30:39.137 --> 30:42.118
And these people are con artists...

30:44.543 --> 30:47.854
But I don't think they killed Lafferty.

30:51.149 --> 30:53.823
Goren: Someone showed Doug
Lafferty the way to the house

30:53.852 --> 30:56.059
and then drove back to the city with him.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.965
Someone Barb and Toby trusted.

30:57.989 --> 31:01.095
They've got thousands
of e-mails to Erica cataloged here

31:01.126 --> 31:03.732
from every state-- and all the replies.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.901
This was a full-time job.

31:05.931 --> 31:08.036
A full-time salary too.

31:08.066 --> 31:11.639
These are drafts of the book
with handwritten revisions.

31:15.474 --> 31:17.351
Looks like most of the book was rewritten.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.720
Not just rewritten, transformed.

31:19.745 --> 31:23.716
This paragraph here
about Erica being told she had ALS,

31:23.749 --> 31:26.093
in the originals...

31:26.118 --> 31:28.257
I think the word you're
looking for is “awful."

31:28.286 --> 31:32.132
Yeah, but the new material,
it breaks your heart.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.728
Whoever made these changes,

31:34.760 --> 31:37.036
it was a labor of love.

31:39.097 --> 31:41.634
What you've done is cruel and heartless.

31:41.666 --> 31:43.737
Arresting Barb and Toby?

31:43.769 --> 31:46.079
That puts Erica in terrible danger.

31:46.104 --> 31:48.243
Have you talked to her since their arrest?

31:48.273 --> 31:50.753
No. She's probably too afraid to call me.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.585
Well, maybe you're hoping she doesn't.

31:52.611 --> 31:55.251
After all, she might ask you
to take care of her.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.419
I would do that without
a moment's hesitation.

31:57.449 --> 31:59.656
That doesn't intimidate me.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.893
It should. You're single, no one to help you.
You have a full-time job.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.333
Erica would be my full-time job.

32:05.357 --> 32:09.328
Goren: You have no doubt

32:09.361 --> 32:13.138
that she's a flesh-and-blood little girl?

32:13.165 --> 32:15.702
No, I don't.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.873
You had a scare last summer.

32:17.903 --> 32:20.679
One of your co-workers told us
you had a bad pap smear.

32:22.240 --> 32:24.379
I had a pre-cancerous

32:24.409 --> 32:26.889
cervical condition which I was treated for,

32:26.912 --> 32:28.983
not that it's any of your business.

32:29.981 --> 32:33.451
Did it raise the question on whether
you'd ever have your own children?

32:33.485 --> 32:36.864
Is that the void that Erica filled?

32:36.888 --> 32:42.236
Erica restored your faith in the human spirit.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.537
She gave you courage in the face of evil.

32:45.564 --> 32:49.671
No one was going to tell you
that she doesn't exist.

32:49.701 --> 32:53.080
To deny her was to deny you.

32:53.104 --> 32:55.983
Okay, this is ridiculous.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.146
IS it?

33:05.250 --> 33:09.164
I don't know where Erica ends and you begin.

33:09.187 --> 33:12.066
You are insane! This is all her!

33:12.090 --> 33:15.970
This is her! This is her life!
These are her thoughts!

33:25.804 --> 33:30.719
Douglas Lafferty's faith
wasn't as strong as yours.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.281
He wanted proof, didn't he?

33:35.313 --> 33:38.954
Is that why you took him to the house?

33:41.753 --> 33:45.724
Or maybe Doug Lafferty's
suspicions weren't appeased

33:45.757 --> 33:47.964
and he was going to make trouble.

33:47.993 --> 33:50.371
No.

33:50.395 --> 33:53.535
Maybe driving back to the city
you tried to reason with him.

33:55.267 --> 33:58.077
You told him how much Erica meant to you.

33:58.103 --> 34:02.176
The closer you got to his home,

34:02.207 --> 34:04.778
the more frantic that you became.

34:04.809 --> 34:08.585
I stayed home all night.
I never left the house.

34:08.612 --> 34:11.753
Eames: We checked the logs of the
messenger service your company uses.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.855
That night they tried
to make deliveries to you

34:14.886 --> 34:17.025
at 9:00 and midnight.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.433
There was no answer either time.

34:23.328 --> 34:26.366
We don't doubt the sincerity
of your beliefs, Ms. Wilkes.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.242
You were taken advantage of.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.216
And I'm willing to take
that into consideration

34:33.237 --> 34:35.946
if you'll tell us the truth.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.723
I stayed home all night.

34:46.585 --> 34:50.226
I went to bed early and that is
why I didn't hear the buzzing.

34:50.255 --> 34:54.704
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I would like to leave.

35:05.403 --> 35:08.179
The power of faith.

35:08.206 --> 35:11.983
Goren: No. She really believes Erica is real.

35:14.879 --> 35:19.794
Maybe a little faith in Erica
isn't such a bad thing.

35:25.390 --> 35:28.701
They freely admit Douglas Lafferty
was at their house that night.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.333
They wouldn't admit that
unless they had nothing to hide.

35:31.363 --> 35:34.037
Or they wanted to create an
impression they had nothing to hide.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.102
I might have been more
pliable a few days ago,

35:36.134 --> 35:38.774
but now that the insurance
policy has come to light--

35:38.803 --> 35:41.340
Attorney: What insurance policy?

35:41.373 --> 35:44.286
Ask your clients.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.149
Four months ago,

35:49.180 --> 35:53.890
Douglas Lafferty changed the
beneficiary on his insurance policy,

35:53.918 --> 35:57.559
naming Erica Windemere
to receive a payout...

35:57.589 --> 36:00.331
Of $2 million.

36:03.361 --> 36:05.534
We didn't know anything about that.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.770
Oh, really?

36:08.867 --> 36:11.006
The money was to be held in trust

36:11.036 --> 36:13.175
with your client as trustee.

36:14.439 --> 36:16.646
$2 million to spend any way she wanted.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.780
Goren: The best part of it is,

36:20.812 --> 36:23.190
you would have been able to keep all of it

36:23.214 --> 36:27.492
without ever having to prove
that Erica exists.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.365
Carver: A murder conviction will,
of course, void the policy.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.700
Crime isn't supposed to pay.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.707
We didn't kill Doug, we swear.

36:37.729 --> 36:42.007
Well, if not you, than who?

36:47.072 --> 36:49.382
I just found out the District Attorney

36:49.407 --> 36:51.887
is seizing Erica's book royalties.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.948
That is inhumane. What is
she supposed to live on?

36:54.979 --> 36:58.256
What's the DA supposed to do?
We did find new evidence

36:58.283 --> 37:01.992
implicating Barb in Doug Lafferty's murder.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.661
Okay, I am not defending what Barb did.

37:05.690 --> 37:09.297
I am just here to protect Erica's interests.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.171
She sent you here to talk to us?

37:16.201 --> 37:19.671
No. No, I e-mailed her, I told her
it was urgent I speak with her.

37:19.704 --> 37:22.514
I don't even think she has
a computer anymore.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.350
You see, this is the precarious
situation she's in.

37:25.376 --> 37:28.846
Without those book royalties, she has nothing.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.521
I thought she had hundreds
of people sending her money?

37:32.550 --> 37:34.860
What? She's in hiding.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.526
How do you expect them
to get the money to her?

37:37.555 --> 37:41.196
- Barb said she was safe.
- Barb is a liar!

37:41.226 --> 37:43.467
Barb needs to be kept away from Erica!

37:43.495 --> 37:45.532
Oh...

37:45.563 --> 37:48.669
- You know what's best for her.
- Yes, I do!

37:48.700 --> 37:51.112
There's a call for Ms. Wilkes.
It's her office.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.776
- Tell them she's busy.
- They said it was important.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.684
They're holding a call from an Erica Windemere.

37:58.743 --> 38:00.950
Put it through in here.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.863
- Christine?
- Erica!

38:09.888 --> 38:13.529
Yes, it's me. I'm here. Hi.

38:13.558 --> 38:17.563
- I'm so happy to hear your voice.
- I am too, Erica.

38:17.595 --> 38:20.974
I'm here with the police right now.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.502
So tell me how you're doing.

38:23.535 --> 38:27.176
All right. But I'm very scared.

38:27.205 --> 38:29.344
I'm taking care of everything.

38:29.374 --> 38:32.412
You don't have to worry about anything.
I'm not going to let you--

38:32.443 --> 38:35.185
Did they tell you about Doug?

38:35.213 --> 38:39.184
Barb told me on the phone
that he had insurance,

38:39.217 --> 38:41.857
but I don't understand these things.

38:41.886 --> 38:45.390
He had a life policy
that left Erica $2 million.

38:46.391 --> 38:49.861
That's incredible! That's a miracle!

38:49.894 --> 38:52.875
( sobbing )
Only now I won't get it...

38:52.897 --> 38:56.902
Because of Barb and what she did to Doug.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.245
Since Barb's the trustee and she killed Doug,

38:59.270 --> 39:01.614
the policy's void and Erica gets nothing.

39:01.639 --> 39:04.848
What's going to happen to me, Christine?

39:04.876 --> 39:08.653
The people I'm with
can't afford to take care of me.

39:08.680 --> 39:13.186
We don't have any money. Barb had it all.

39:13.218 --> 39:15.824
( sobbing )

39:19.190 --> 39:22.660
Erica? Listen to me, sweetheart.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.935
Nothing bad is going to happen to you.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.068
She needs more health insurance.

39:27.098 --> 39:29.339
I'm going to end up in a home.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.176
No. No, you're not.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.079
I'm going to make sure of that.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.675
How? With what money?

39:35.707 --> 39:37.744
I mean--

39:37.775 --> 39:40.949
Erica's at the end of her rope.
isn't that right, Erica?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.687
I'm so sorry, Christine.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.854
I tried to be brave,

39:45.884 --> 39:49.696
but losing Barb and Toby--

39:49.721 --> 39:52.759
- Erica--
- It's just too much.

39:52.790 --> 39:57.034
You taught me so much about accepting loss

39:57.061 --> 40:00.042
and uncertainty and hardship...

40:00.064 --> 40:02.271
And appreciating

40:02.300 --> 40:05.042
what is beautiful and hopeful in life.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.549
Beauty won't help.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.382
Her disease is going to get worse.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.388
That's what she has to look forward to--

40:12.410 --> 40:16.290
more hardship, loss and uncertainty.

40:17.582 --> 40:21.621
Erica, you know that I would
sacrifice everything for you.

40:21.653 --> 40:24.566
You better mean it...

40:24.589 --> 40:26.728
Because she's got no one else.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.898
You’re the only one I have left, Christine.

40:29.928 --> 40:34.638
- I know-- what-- Erica?
- ( phone clicks, dial tone hums )

40:34.666 --> 40:36.805
Erica? Erica?

40:37.802 --> 40:39.941
Erica?

40:40.939 --> 40:44.512
Erica?! Erica?!

40:45.610 --> 40:47.749
Erica--?

40:50.548 --> 40:53.085
- ( dial tone stops )
- ( sobbing )

40:53.117 --> 40:55.927
Goren: What are you going to do, Christine?

40:55.954 --> 40:58.264
That money could change everything for her.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.929
It could save her life.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.176
Whatever you did...

41:12.403 --> 41:16.044
You did to defend your faith in her.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.718
Your heart was pure.

41:26.918 --> 41:30.730
Now it's time to take the final step...

41:32.256 --> 41:35.601
To give Erica the greatest gift.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.772
You need to do this...

41:44.102 --> 41:47.606
Or your faith in Erica will have been...

41:47.638 --> 41:49.777
a lie.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.255
( whispers )
I did it.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.726
Not Barb.

42:05.723 --> 42:08.203
I killed Doug.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.737
Tell me what you did.

42:13.731 --> 42:16.905
I killed him in his garage.

42:18.069 --> 42:22.745
I used nail polish remover
and I set him on fire.

42:25.243 --> 42:28.087
He was going to hurt Erica.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.888
He kept saying she wasn't real...

42:30.915 --> 42:33.919
And I couldn't let him say that.

42:34.919 --> 42:38.196
You know, I just couldn't let him say that.

42:45.263 --> 42:48.335
( sobbing )

42:50.034 --> 42:53.072
So, now I get the insurance money, right?
When do I get it?

42:53.104 --> 42:55.584
- Sorry.
- What?

42:55.606 --> 42:58.746
Erica isn't the only thing that doesn't exist.

42:58.776 --> 43:01.188
You lied?

43:01.212 --> 43:03.988
You lied to me?

43:04.015 --> 43:06.154
I helped you and--

43:09.420 --> 43:12.765
You ruined everything.

43:18.062 --> 43:21.532
Erica will be so disappointed in them.

43:28.372 --> 43:31.581
