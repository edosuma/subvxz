Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Bobby Driver"</font>

00:20.186 --> 00:21.457
So let me get this straight.

00:21.764 --> 00:24.831
This is called a "Toy Aisle,"
and some kids have parents

00:24.918 --> 00:27.072
who come here and
buy things for them?

00:27.159 --> 00:28.159
That sounds made-up.

00:28.246 --> 00:30.356
How are we all having
the same dream right now?

00:30.443 --> 00:31.834
Kids, pick out a gift, please.

00:31.921 --> 00:33.455
We're already late for
your friend's party.

00:33.542 --> 00:35.968
He's not our friend.
We barely talk to Colton.

00:36.055 --> 00:37.627
He's not even
in any of our grades.

00:37.714 --> 00:39.690
There's a lot of nice people
who aren't in our grades.

00:39.777 --> 00:41.242
Name one,
and don't say Mom.

00:41.329 --> 00:42.730
You know
what I think this is?

00:42.817 --> 00:45.717
Colton's padding out his invite
list to get more presents.

00:45.804 --> 00:47.023
He's a gift grubber.

00:47.110 --> 00:48.815
Louise, come on,
give Colton a chance.

00:48.902 --> 00:50.794
Tina's right, you got
to give people a chance.

00:50.881 --> 00:52.291
Sometimes
they surprise you.

00:52.378 --> 00:54.278
Now, seriously,
pick a gift and let's go.

00:54.365 --> 00:57.024
Fine. Rubik's Cube.
Well, a fake one.

00:57.111 --> 00:59.393
It says
"Multicolored Puzzle Square."

00:59.480 --> 01:01.256
- Ugh, I want it.
- Toys are great.

01:01.343 --> 01:02.348
There are no price tags

01:02.435 --> 01:04.340
on the batteries.
How much are the batteries?

01:04.427 --> 01:06.856
- How much are the batteries?!
- I don't work here.

01:06.943 --> 01:08.398
Then what's with the attitude?!

01:08.485 --> 01:09.599
Ugh, it's Edith.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.489
- Kids, let's go.
- What's wrong, Dad?

01:11.576 --> 01:13.889
Give her a chance.
She might surprise you.

01:13.976 --> 01:15.668
That only applies if it's not Edith.

01:15.755 --> 01:17.144
She's always awful.

01:17.231 --> 01:19.215
Dad, maybe someday
when you're old,

01:19.302 --> 01:21.361
a family will run away
from you.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.184
Wow.
They went all out.

01:23.271 --> 01:25.808
It says on the invite
the theme is The Great Gatsby.

01:25.895 --> 01:27.248
I don't know about great.

01:27.335 --> 01:29.123
Kind of a weird theme
for a kid's party.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.832
Hi. We're Colton's parents.
I'm Blake and this is Allison.

01:31.919 --> 01:33.622
Well, aren't you kids
the bee's knees.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.404
Colton, come say hi!

01:35.491 --> 01:37.560
Here you go, a boater
for the little gentleman

01:37.647 --> 01:39.262
and flapper feathers for the girls.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.698
- Ha. That's... cute.
- Want to swap?

01:41.785 --> 01:44.505
Yes, please!
Call me Feather Locklear.

01:44.592 --> 01:47.582
- Colton? What do we say?
- Thanks for coming to my party.

01:47.669 --> 01:49.770
Thank you for having us, Colton.
We brought you a present.

01:49.857 --> 01:51.886
Add it to the present pile,
Colton.

01:51.973 --> 01:53.876
Can't I just
open my presents now?

01:53.963 --> 01:56.225
Party first, bud,
then presents.

01:57.774 --> 02:00.955
- See? Classic gift grubber.
- Oh, wait, before you go,

02:01.042 --> 02:02.597
Colton, let me get a
pic with your friends.

02:02.684 --> 02:04.411
After you take your
finger out of your nose.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.923
Finger out of your...
No, you just switched fingers.

02:07.010 --> 02:08.124
Better, that's better.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.193
Okay! Say, "23 skidoo!"

02:10.280 --> 02:11.990
23 skidoo.

02:12.077 --> 02:14.130
Okay, well, I got to get
back to the restaurant,

02:14.217 --> 02:15.569
so, uh, have fun.

02:15.656 --> 02:19.136
- 23 skidoo to you!
- I don't know what that means.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.832
- Neither do we!
- Okay. Bye.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.261
Hey, Teddy, you got a
spring in your step today.

02:25.348 --> 02:26.930
Oh, no, wait,
you look depressed.

02:27.017 --> 02:29.250
Eh, well, the good news
is I've got a second date

02:29.337 --> 02:31.085
with that lady I told
you about, Caroline.

02:31.172 --> 02:33.249
- That's great!
- Yeah, but she wants to get sushi.

02:33.336 --> 02:35.709
I hate sushi, but Caroline loves sushi,

02:35.796 --> 02:37.986
so I said, "Hey, I love sushi, too!"

02:38.073 --> 02:39.589
And now I got to sit across from her

02:39.676 --> 02:41.362
and choke on my disgusting lies.

02:41.449 --> 02:43.204
Why don't you just get
the chicken teriyaki?

02:43.291 --> 02:45.662
Why don't you just get the
chicken teriyaki, Mort?!

02:45.749 --> 02:48.197
Whoa, whoa, Teddy, calm
down. We can help you.

02:48.284 --> 02:49.803
We can get you to like sushi.

02:49.890 --> 02:52.502
Really? But my date's
tonight. It's not enough time.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.116
We'll see about that.
I'll call in a sushi order.

02:55.203 --> 02:57.845
- Oh, my God, this is happening.
- Can I get a spicy tuna roll?

02:57.932 --> 02:59.620
Can I get a California
inside-out roll, please?

02:59.707 --> 03:01.444
Hold on, hold on, let me get a pencil.

03:01.531 --> 03:03.227
Should we just be
a sushi restaurant?

03:03.314 --> 03:05.664
Don't tell Bob;
we'll see if he notices.

03:05.797 --> 03:07.140
Hmm, is that Edith?

03:07.227 --> 03:10.607
She's really struggling with
those bags. Kinda sorry.

03:10.694 --> 03:12.270
Oh! Pee and poop!

03:12.357 --> 03:14.828
Oh god, alright.

03:14.915 --> 03:17.343
E-Edith,
hey do you need a ride?

03:17.430 --> 03:20.731
Oh Bob, I saw you in the store and
tried to avoid you

03:20.818 --> 03:24.928
- Okay, so you're alright then?
- Hm, I'll take a ride

03:25.015 --> 03:28.069
- Yes, that would be very helpful
- Oh, great then hop in.

03:28.156 --> 03:29.568
Your car looks like it has ants.

03:29.655 --> 03:31.891
- It does.
- I feel bad for them.

03:32.195 --> 03:34.992
So, you were
walking really far, huh?

03:35.079 --> 03:36.633
I can't drive my car
right now.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.288
Oh, I-Is there something
wrong with it?

03:38.375 --> 03:40.386
No, I have fits,
bad ones.

03:40.473 --> 03:42.756
Oh, what does "fits"
mean exactly?

03:42.843 --> 03:45.500
- Fits! Fits!
- Or we could just not talk.

03:45.587 --> 03:46.694
- Here.
- What are these?

03:46.781 --> 03:48.134
Pills. Hold on to the bottle.

03:48.221 --> 03:50.722
If I start to have a fit,
just put one in my hand.

03:50.809 --> 03:52.528
Great. I'm so glad we're doing this.

03:52.615 --> 03:54.789
- Bob, would you do me a favor?
- Another one?

03:54.876 --> 03:56.428
I just need to make a quick stop.

03:56.515 --> 03:59.086
I wouldn't trouble you,
but it's so hard being older

03:59.173 --> 04:00.543
and not being able to drive.

04:00.630 --> 04:03.177
Okay, I guess a
quick stop would be fine, Edith.

04:03.264 --> 04:06.313
All right, guys and dolls,
we're gonna learn the Charleston.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.870
First you wiggle that finger.
Then you jiggle those knees.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.180
A-wiggle, wiggle, wiggle.
A-jiggle, jiggle, jiggle.

04:11.267 --> 04:14.483
- Oh, my God, this is so cute.
- I love it. I'm dying.

04:14.633 --> 04:16.319
Ugh, look at Colton.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.779
He's just picking his
nose till present time.

04:18.866 --> 04:20.793
That'd be a great name
for his autobiography.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.129
Louise,
give Colton a chance.

04:22.216 --> 04:23.606
Tall
flapper in the glasses?

04:23.693 --> 04:25.247
Remember to wiggle
your finger.

04:25.334 --> 04:26.367
- Sorry.
- Pssh.

04:26.454 --> 04:28.469
Colton doesn't deserve
all those presents,

04:28.556 --> 04:29.849
and he certainly doesn't deserve

04:29.936 --> 04:32.202
our perfectly fine
off-brand puzzle toy.

04:32.289 --> 04:33.349
We should take it back.

04:33.436 --> 04:34.609
What? No! I think

04:34.696 --> 04:36.210
that's against birthday
party etiquette.

04:36.297 --> 04:37.746
Well, I follow
David Arquette-iquette,

04:37.833 --> 04:39.934
and that guy does
whatever he wants.

04:40.021 --> 04:42.093
Plus, I really don't think
you're right about him, Louise.

04:42.180 --> 04:43.642
Oh, yeah?
Prove me wrong.

04:43.729 --> 04:45.617
Tall
flapper in the glasses!

04:45.704 --> 04:47.492
I'm wiggling, damn it!

04:48.077 --> 04:49.957
Ugh, finally. Whoa.

04:50.044 --> 04:52.717
She's walking really
fast. Like, really fast.

04:52.804 --> 04:54.084
Drive, damn it, drive!

04:54.171 --> 04:55.835
- What?
- Let's move! Go!

04:55.922 --> 04:58.354
- Wait, what's happening?
- I said step on the gas, you ass!

04:58.441 --> 05:01.008
I'm stepping on it.
It's an old car.

05:02.446 --> 05:04.836
Eleanor Hirschbaum
never knew what hit her.

05:05.164 --> 05:07.545
Who is Eleanor Hirschbaum?
What is this all about?

05:07.632 --> 05:08.624
- Quilting.
- Huh?

05:08.711 --> 05:10.597
Quilting!
What else would it be about?

05:10.684 --> 05:12.553
My quilting circle was
making a quilt

05:12.640 --> 05:14.092
to celebrate the town history;

05:14.179 --> 05:16.070
each member got to do a square,

05:16.177 --> 05:18.812
but my square got
rejected by the bossy biddy

05:18.899 --> 05:20.513
who leads the group,
Lillian.

05:20.600 --> 05:23.601
She said the subject
matter was inappropriate.

05:23.688 --> 05:26.206
When I stood up to her, she
kicked me out of the group.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.933
Wait, wait, wait, Lillian is
the lady you just stole from?

05:29.020 --> 05:31.765
- No, that's Eleanor!
- So many old lady names.

05:31.852 --> 05:34.232
Today, everyone's supposed
to stitch their squares together

05:34.319 --> 05:36.079
in a ceremony
at the Wharf Arts Center.

05:36.166 --> 05:38.239
Oh, it's a big fancy to-do,

05:38.326 --> 05:41.391
but who's gonna have all
the squares? Me!

05:42.485 --> 05:45.148
Ugh. Why did you drag
me into this, Edith?

05:45.235 --> 05:47.460
Oh, I didn't plan to.
I was gonna hoof it,

05:47.547 --> 05:50.460
but then the universe sent me
a guy with a filthy car

05:50.547 --> 05:52.281
- and nothing to lose.
- Nothing to lose?

05:52.368 --> 05:54.235
I-I have a family
and a business.

05:54.322 --> 05:56.630
The restaurant?
You can't be serious.

05:56.717 --> 05:59.979
Less talk more pedal, huh?
We have squares to snatch.

06:00.066 --> 06:03.235
- I-I'm taking you home.
- Grow a pair and then some hair.

06:03.322 --> 06:05.352
I'm not doing this, Edith.
Just get out.

06:05.439 --> 06:07.367
Ah, fine, you big baby.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.621
Let an old lady gather her
supplies and I'll be...

06:11.047 --> 06:12.137
Edith?

06:12.701 --> 06:14.393
Are you okay?
Are you having a fit?

06:14.567 --> 06:16.451
Pill! Pill, damn it,
pill! Pill!

06:16.591 --> 06:20.286
Here! Here!
Aren't you gonna swallow it?

06:20.373 --> 06:23.036
- Drive me, Bob.
- What? N-No.

06:23.123 --> 06:25.895
This is the easy part.
Then comes the shaking.

06:25.982 --> 06:28.117
- Then the spitting.
- Are you crazy?!

06:28.204 --> 06:29.723
Take the pill, Edith!

06:29.810 --> 06:32.855
You want an old lady's fit
on your conscience, Bob?

06:32.942 --> 06:35.491
Can you live with it?
Can you?

06:35.578 --> 06:39.735
Fine! Fine, I'll drive you.
Just take the pill.

06:39.822 --> 06:42.927
Now... let's ride.

06:43.083 --> 06:46.497
I'm taking off my seatbelt.
It's chafing my honkers.

06:48.810 --> 06:51.223
Edith, are-are you okay?
I-I really think I should

06:51.310 --> 06:53.619
just take you to the
hospital and not do your plan.

06:53.706 --> 06:54.761
Your plan is very bad.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.807
Do you always talk this much?
Pull up here.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.512
- Wait, where are we?
- Phillip Frond's house.

06:59.599 --> 07:01.012
This is Mr. Frond's house?

07:01.099 --> 07:03.057
You're gonna steal from
my kids' guidance counselor

07:03.144 --> 07:04.198
while I wait in the car?

07:04.285 --> 07:06.990
Relax, I'm not gonna hurt him.
Quilt people are pushovers.

07:07.077 --> 07:08.753
You just compliment
their needlework,

07:08.840 --> 07:10.620
and they roll over like a puppy.

07:10.707 --> 07:13.206
And when their guard's
down, snatchy, snatchy.

07:13.293 --> 07:14.685
Keep your engine running.

07:14.911 --> 07:17.356
Ooh, it's almost badminton time,

07:17.443 --> 07:19.260
and then it'll be present time.

07:19.347 --> 07:21.734
Oh, won't that be a treat?
For Colton.

07:21.821 --> 07:24.270
Ugh! Gene,
your feet smell really bad.

07:24.357 --> 07:26.743
I'm airing them out.
All that dancing gave me

07:26.830 --> 07:27.971
soggy flapper feet.

07:28.058 --> 07:31.079
Wait, I have an idea.
We don't just take our present back,

07:31.166 --> 07:33.922
we take our present back
and plop Gene's smelly socks

07:34.009 --> 07:35.675
in the gift bag instead.

07:35.894 --> 07:37.405
Colton's stinking up our Saturday,

07:37.492 --> 07:39.165
let's stink up his precious gift table.

07:39.252 --> 07:40.768
Louise, you said you'd give me time.

07:40.855 --> 07:41.953
Just let me talk to Colton.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.619
He's not as bad as you think; I know it.

07:43.706 --> 07:45.071
Ugh! Fine, Tina.

07:45.158 --> 07:46.559
You've got until he opens presents,

07:46.646 --> 07:49.553
then the gloves come
off, the feet gloves.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.869
Okay. Here I go.

07:50.956 --> 07:52.511
- Hi, Colton.
- Hey.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.516
Birthdays, huh? Hey,
could I ask you something?

07:54.603 --> 07:55.748
Badminton!

07:55.835 --> 07:58.199
Come on, flappers and
dappers, let's play!

07:58.286 --> 08:01.227
Glasses, talking to you.
Colton, get your game face on.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.909
Ah, dang it.

08:03.393 --> 08:06.252
I feel so badly about what
happened with the quilters.

08:06.339 --> 08:08.279
There are some lovely
crafts in this room.

08:08.366 --> 08:10.534
You didn't make all this
stuff yourself, did you?

08:10.621 --> 08:11.793
Oh, actually, I did.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.620
Oh, what are you, some
kind of secret genius?

08:14.707 --> 08:15.750
Secret genius?

08:15.837 --> 08:19.007
No, no, I'm just a
dabbler in the fiber arts.

08:19.094 --> 08:20.918
Oh, my, what is that?

08:21.005 --> 08:23.172
Ah. I call that "Needle-Point Break."

08:23.259 --> 08:26.150
That's Ke-yarn-u Reeves
and Patrick Swayz-yarn.

08:26.237 --> 08:28.345
It's, uh, one in a series,
actually.

08:28.437 --> 08:30.565
Well, in that case,
I must see all of them.

08:30.652 --> 08:32.953
Oh, really? I-I've got to
get them. They're in the back.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.073
- Okay.
- Have you seen Con Air?

08:35.159 --> 08:37.313
Because there are some
spoilers in the needlepoint.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.111
Okay, well, I'll try not
to look at those parts.

08:40.249 --> 08:41.494
Here's eight sushis.

08:41.581 --> 08:42.746
What's all the stuff?

08:42.832 --> 08:44.734
- It comes with stuff.
- It comes with stuff?

08:44.821 --> 08:47.311
Yeah, lots of little stuff.
You dip it and you dunk it.

08:47.410 --> 08:48.591
It's like a fun little game.

08:48.678 --> 08:50.138
Uh... I got to put ketchup on it.

08:50.225 --> 08:51.902
No, Teddy, no. Bob's Burgers.

08:51.989 --> 08:54.325
- We're eating sushi.
- What? Linda, it's me.

08:54.412 --> 08:56.802
- Listen, I might need your help.
- Bob, where the heck are you?

08:56.889 --> 08:58.724
You were supposed to be
back a half an hour ago.

08:58.811 --> 09:01.045
Well, Edith is making me
drive her all over town

09:01.132 --> 09:03.153
- to get back at her quilters circle...
- Ugh, it hurts!

09:03.240 --> 09:05.858
- Why?! Why?!
- Is that Teddy? Is he okay?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.368
Oh, no. Bob, I got to go.

09:07.455 --> 09:09.297
Teddy just ate
a handful of wasabi.

09:09.384 --> 09:11.601
I thought
it was guacamole.

09:11.743 --> 09:13.546
Hold on,
here's the guacamole.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.655
It's that stuff again!

09:15.742 --> 09:18.578
I got to go, Bob, I got to go.
Have fun with Edith. Good-bye.

09:18.665 --> 09:19.712
Oh, my face!

09:19.799 --> 09:22.955
- Drive! Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
- Okay, okay.

09:23.828 --> 09:25.624
Edith? Huh?

09:25.787 --> 09:27.849
Darn it, I dropped Needlejuice.

09:27.936 --> 09:31.899
Ugh, look at this crummy thing.
And they rejected my square?

09:31.986 --> 09:33.739
- My freaks?
- Your freaks?

09:33.826 --> 09:35.772
Left here.
Left. Left. Left!

09:35.860 --> 09:37.585
What kind of getaway driver
are you?

09:37.680 --> 09:39.940
- Just do a U-ey over this lawn.
- No, I...

09:40.027 --> 09:42.131
- Just drive. Come on!
- Oh, God!

09:42.670 --> 09:46.320
<i>♪ Come on, we got to
do some quiltin'! ♪</i>

09:48.367 --> 09:50.796
<i>♪ That's right, drive, baby ♪</i>

09:52.852 --> 09:55.028
<i>♪ All right, smack it ♪</i>

09:57.433 --> 09:59.257
<i>♪ Get that square, baby ♪</i>

09:59.344 --> 10:01.007
<i>♪ Uh! ♪</i>

10:02.118 --> 10:03.820
<i>♪ Ooh! ♪</i>

10:06.315 --> 10:08.270
<i>♪ Come on, Bob. ♪</i>

10:11.984 --> 10:13.833
That sign back there said "yield."

10:13.920 --> 10:17.134
- You didn't really yield.
- Yeah, it kind of felt amazing.

10:17.221 --> 10:19.249
- You're an animal.
- I am.

10:19.336 --> 10:21.190
Well, we saved
the worst for last...

10:21.277 --> 10:23.786
The head of the quilters circle,
the horse's ass

10:23.873 --> 10:25.988
who rejected my square,
Lillian.

10:26.075 --> 10:27.466
Great, you-you deal with that.

10:27.553 --> 10:29.765
I'll do the sitting and
waiting and driving cool.

10:29.852 --> 10:32.997
Yeah, you forgot sweating.
Nice pit stains, cool guy.

10:33.084 --> 10:34.473
Yeah,
it's a problem.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.847
All right, next croquet group,
you're up.

10:36.934 --> 10:39.185
Can I get a picture?
Colton, finger.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.288
Got to feel
for Colton's parents.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.652
They're working hard out there,
and Colton's giving 'em nothing.

10:43.739 --> 10:45.911
I'm gonna hit my ball
towards Colton so I can try

10:45.998 --> 10:47.133
to talk to him again.

10:47.253 --> 10:49.091
Oh, that didn't go very
far. Let me hit again.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.074
That didn't go very far.
Let me hit it again.

10:51.513 --> 10:53.011
Now I'm getting
it, now I'm getting it.

10:53.098 --> 10:54.506
Oh, my God, he's still so far away.

10:54.593 --> 10:57.287
It's not worth slowly tapping
your way over to him, Tina.

10:57.374 --> 10:58.933
You know, sometimes,
people are as terrible

10:59.020 --> 11:00.096
as you think they are.

11:00.183 --> 11:02.558
If you can't handle reality,
you should've stayed inside of Mom.

11:02.645 --> 11:03.841
That was an option?!

11:03.928 --> 11:05.341
Hey, I know we're in the past,

11:05.428 --> 11:07.858
but let's move into
the presents.

11:07.945 --> 11:10.294
As in,
let's open some presents!

11:10.381 --> 11:12.382
Everyone looks confused.
It's fine, it's fine.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.579
Time's up, Tina. Gene, start
the sock removal process.

11:15.666 --> 11:18.742
- No.
- Whew! I made that.

11:19.172 --> 11:20.179
I'll take those.

11:20.266 --> 11:21.545
Oh, my God,
we're gonna kill him.

11:21.632 --> 11:23.342
Wait, wait.
Pre-present portraits.

11:23.429 --> 11:26.036
Give me the anticipation.
Give me the jealousy.

11:26.123 --> 11:28.618
- Smell you later.
- What are you doing?

11:28.705 --> 11:30.553
Colton! Hi. I was just, uh...

11:30.640 --> 11:33.151
What's that smell?
Were you gonna take back my gift

11:33.238 --> 11:36.114
- and wrap dirty socks instead?
- Whoa, slow down.

11:36.201 --> 11:38.561
What you're describing
is a felony, probably.

11:38.648 --> 11:41.456
- No, I think it's hilarious.
- What? You do?

11:41.543 --> 11:43.483
Yeah.
It would drive my parents nuts.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.201
This was all their idea.
They wanted everything to be perfect.

11:46.288 --> 11:47.967
All I wanted was
a pizza party for me

11:48.054 --> 11:50.351
and my imaginary friend,
Pete Zaparti.

11:50.438 --> 11:53.467
- Pete Zaparti. Ha, ha, nice.
- Thanks, I'll tell him.

11:53.554 --> 11:56.788
Anyway, Dad said that wouldn't
look good on "sosh-meed."

11:56.875 --> 11:59.344
- "Sosh-meed"?
- He and my mom are always telling me

11:59.431 --> 12:00.859
to "act more postable."

12:00.946 --> 12:03.024
Well, for someone who
didn't want a big party,

12:03.134 --> 12:05.422
you seemed pretty excited
to open those presents.

12:05.509 --> 12:07.586
Yeah, because after
that, everyone goes home.

12:07.673 --> 12:08.842
I want to get to that part.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.373
Boaters, boaters. Everybody,
straighten them out.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.373
It's fun
to have straight boaters!

12:13.460 --> 12:16.928
I'll get the bird's eye, babe.
Hashtag Colton's Gatsby Day.

12:17.015 --> 12:19.180
Ugh. Hashtag barf.

12:19.516 --> 12:22.797
Uh, sir? The lady you drove
here with is having a fit,

12:22.884 --> 12:25.959
and technically she's not
our responsibility, so...

12:26.046 --> 12:27.579
Oh, my God.

12:27.938 --> 12:30.876
- There you are. Pill!
- Here. Take it.

12:31.001 --> 12:32.815
- Dresser drawer.
- What?

12:32.902 --> 12:34.998
Her room's behind you.
The square's in her dresser.

12:35.085 --> 12:36.896
I am not getting it, Edith.

12:36.985 --> 12:39.856
- Then I'm not taking the pill.
- Ugh, fine.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.373
U-Uh, watch her.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.540
I'll-I'll be right back.

12:44.579 --> 12:47.968
I hate this, I hate this, I hate this,
I hate this, I hate this.

12:49.254 --> 12:52.460
Sergeant Bosco?
Is Lillian Sergeant Bosco's...?

12:52.547 --> 12:54.537
Find what you were looking for?

12:54.624 --> 12:56.439
I'm better now. We'll be going.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.969
- He's my lover, by the way.
- Hi.

12:58.056 --> 12:59.681
You'll stay right where you are.

12:59.768 --> 13:01.566
The other quilters
warned me you'd be coming.

13:01.653 --> 13:04.348
My son is a police officer.
He'll be here any minute.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.976
He'll plant drugs on you.
He'll plant drugs on all of you!

13:07.063 --> 13:08.592
- Let's go, hot stuff.
- Oh!

13:08.878 --> 13:11.360
- Oh! Stop them!
- Huh?

13:16.366 --> 13:17.791
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

13:17.878 --> 13:19.340
oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:19.427 --> 13:22.140
Ooooh!
Now this is how you quilt!

13:24.953 --> 13:27.143
Oh, that was maybe the
worst thing I've ever done.

13:27.230 --> 13:29.387
Really?
This is a pretty good day for me.

13:29.474 --> 13:31.279
Now point this
"not rod" thataway

13:31.366 --> 13:33.897
and drive me to my store.

13:34.090 --> 13:36.830
You called me to find
your missing quilt square?

13:36.917 --> 13:38.264
Mother,
this is ridiculous.

13:38.351 --> 13:40.259
Your brother would care
about my quilt.

13:40.346 --> 13:42.786
You only visit when they
have a hot fudge sundae bar.

13:42.873 --> 13:45.698
That is not true.
Listen, I'll look into it.

13:45.785 --> 13:47.490
- Is today hot fudge sundaes?
- No.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.973
- Damn.
- And I'm going with you.

13:49.085 --> 13:51.299
All right, fine.
Are there cookies?

13:51.386 --> 13:53.694
- You may have one cookie.
- Yes.

13:54.051 --> 13:56.475
Oh, wow, look at that. Hold it up.

13:56.562 --> 13:58.789
Higher. Turn your head.
You're loving this,

13:58.876 --> 13:59.889
- you're loving this.
- Ah...

13:59.976 --> 14:01.602
It was right
in front of us all along.

14:01.689 --> 14:03.227
Can't believe
we got it so wrong.

14:03.314 --> 14:04.590
- Well, actually, I...
- Shush, shush, shush.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.188
- We all got it wrong.
- Right.

14:06.275 --> 14:08.615
There's got to be something
we can do for this kid.

14:08.702 --> 14:10.630
Well, if he thought my
dirty socks were funny,

14:10.717 --> 14:11.913
let's give him my underpants.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.110
Ooh, or my sports bra.

14:15.353 --> 14:16.352
Here we are.

14:16.439 --> 14:18.633
- Good-bye, Edith.
- Good-bye, Bob.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.774
Is what I'll say after you drive
us to the Wharf Arts Center.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.241
Ceremony starts in 20 minutes.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.539
- Step on it, chubs.
- Are you kidding me?!

14:25.626 --> 14:27.750
No time to discuss.
If the cops are on our trail,

14:27.837 --> 14:29.115
this is the first place
they'll look.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.227
Aaaah!

14:30.878 --> 14:32.232
How's it going
back there, Harold?

14:32.319 --> 14:34.954
It's going. Ugh, take it
easy on the bumps, chump.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.843
- He's a bad driver.
- Yeah, terrible.

14:36.930 --> 14:38.732
- Learn to drive.
- What are you even doing?

14:38.819 --> 14:41.263
I thought the plan was just
to take everyone's squares?

14:41.350 --> 14:43.171
- This is phase two.
- Phase two.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.576
They're expecting a quilt
at the Wharf Arts Center,

14:45.663 --> 14:47.984
and Harold and I are
gonna give it to them.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.695
- Unbelievable.
- Oh, pipe down.

14:50.782 --> 14:52.717
Soon this'll be over,
and you can go back

14:52.804 --> 14:54.043
to your boring little...

14:54.130 --> 14:56.139
- Uh, hmm.
- Was that you, Edith?

14:56.226 --> 14:57.992
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Uh-oh.

14:58.079 --> 14:59.420
Take one of your gas pills.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.502
- Hmm. Hush up, Harold!
- Okay.

15:01.589 --> 15:03.960
Wait. Gas pills?
You mean these?

15:04.047 --> 15:06.340
Hey, how come fatty's
got your fart meds?

15:06.427 --> 15:08.843
- Has he got the toots, too?
- Harold!

15:08.930 --> 15:11.062
So you don't really get fits?

15:11.149 --> 15:12.984
I get farts. Close enough!

15:13.071 --> 15:15.082
Is it even true that
you're not allowed to drive?

15:15.169 --> 15:17.132
The car's in the shop.
Same thing.

15:17.883 --> 15:20.070
This is
incredible. You tricked me.

15:20.157 --> 15:21.873
Do you know how much trouble
I could get in, Edith?

15:21.960 --> 15:23.170
Not to mention my family.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.102
My wife is probably worried
sick.

15:25.258 --> 15:26.796
This is the only thing

15:26.883 --> 15:29.935
I care about in this
world right now! Eat it!

15:30.022 --> 15:31.766
Both of you, out of the car.

15:31.853 --> 15:33.849
Come on, Harold.

15:33.936 --> 15:35.446
Mm, okay.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.772
- Harold, the quilt, the quilt!
- Oops.

15:37.859 --> 15:39.678
Is that your square?

15:39.765 --> 15:41.169
- What's on it?
- What do you care?

15:41.256 --> 15:43.281
- It just looks...
- Incredible?

15:43.368 --> 15:44.912
- Maybe.
- It's the freak show.

15:44.999 --> 15:45.984
The freak show?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.740
Yeah. It used to be
down at the Wonder Wharf.

15:47.827 --> 15:49.514
It was a big part of
this town for years.

15:49.601 --> 15:52.201
That's Two-Faced Tommy,
that's Howie the Pinhead,

15:52.288 --> 15:54.054
Bearded Becky,
Tattooed Larry

15:54.141 --> 15:55.994
and his companion
Pumpkinhead Gary.

15:56.081 --> 15:58.982
There's Righty the Left-Hander.
That was freaky back then.

15:59.069 --> 16:01.107
Uh, who's that?
The-the little girl?

16:01.194 --> 16:02.499
That's, well...

16:02.586 --> 16:04.793
That's me. My parents
worked on the wharf.

16:04.899 --> 16:06.954
The freaks looked after
me, kept me out of trouble.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.412
But Lillian thinks the freaks

16:08.499 --> 16:10.538
don't belong on the
town's history quilt.

16:10.625 --> 16:11.810
She thinks they're shameful.

16:11.897 --> 16:14.490
Just 'cause their nipples are
three times as long as ours.

16:14.577 --> 16:16.030
Well, that one guy, at least.

16:16.117 --> 16:20.085
Yeah, that's, uh, kind of sweet.
I-I don't know what to say.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.965
Go home, Bob. Harold
and I will take the bus.

16:23.797 --> 16:25.158
No, you won't.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.732
Get back in the car,
both of you.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.640
What? I just got out of the car.

16:28.727 --> 16:31.897
Do you know how hard it is for
me to get in and out of cars?

16:31.984 --> 16:34.868
- Harold, do what the man said!
- All right.

16:35.353 --> 16:36.407
Thank you, Bob.

16:36.494 --> 16:38.597
Don't thank me, Edith.
Well, you know what?

16:38.684 --> 16:40.140
- Thank me.
- Yeah, I just did.

16:40.227 --> 16:43.122
Stop flirting with my wife.
She's spoken for!

16:45.821 --> 16:47.522
Take the long way to the Arts Center.

16:47.609 --> 16:49.876
Harold needs more time.
He's a slow sew.

16:49.963 --> 16:52.132
- I am not.
- All right, I'll take the long way.

16:52.219 --> 16:54.101
But I'm worried Bosco's
looking for us.

16:54.188 --> 16:55.207
Keep your eyes peeled.

16:55.294 --> 16:56.906
Is that a joke
about my cataracts?

16:56.993 --> 16:58.977
- No, but that's kind of funny.
- Ha.

16:59.086 --> 17:02.110
- It's closed. I give up.
- Oh, of course you do.

17:02.197 --> 17:03.749
Who are you calling?
Cab, hopefully?

17:03.836 --> 17:05.048
The other quilters.

17:05.135 --> 17:07.319
I think I know where that
crazy bag of bones is heading.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.788
Get in the car. We're going
to the Wharf Arts Center.

17:09.875 --> 17:13.220
I'll just do all my other
police work later, I guess.

17:13.398 --> 17:15.661
Last present.
Ooh, look at the light.

17:15.748 --> 17:17.346
Everyone, gather up.

17:17.433 --> 17:19.813
Colton? Nose, finger. Separate them.

17:19.900 --> 17:21.595
Ugh, they're all over him.

17:21.682 --> 17:23.858
- You know what? Enough's enough.
- Wait, what?

17:23.945 --> 17:25.567
This one's for you, Colton.

17:25.654 --> 17:27.502
Uh, little girl? Finger?

17:27.589 --> 17:30.962
We got any other pickers at the
party? Come on, don't be shy.

17:31.049 --> 17:32.270
Wait, what's-what's going on?

17:32.357 --> 17:33.781
Don't be afraid
to double barrel it.

17:33.868 --> 17:35.344
Absolutely not. No double barrel.

17:35.431 --> 17:38.283
- Yes, double barrel.
- That's it, that's it!

17:38.854 --> 17:41.685
Nice, uh, house.
Tell me about these sconces.

17:41.772 --> 17:44.216
The sconces are from Florence,
and there's a whole story there,

17:44.303 --> 17:45.550
but right now
you need to tell me

17:45.637 --> 17:47.542
why you're trying
to ruin Colton's party.

17:47.629 --> 17:50.114
- It's not my party.
- What did you say, sweetie?

17:50.201 --> 17:51.722
The party's really for you guys.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.114
What do you mean?

17:53.201 --> 17:54.450
I think what he means is,

17:54.537 --> 17:56.136
sometimes we do things
for our kids,

17:56.223 --> 17:58.559
but they're not really
for our kids.

17:58.646 --> 18:01.209
I mean, not that I have kids,
that I know of.

18:01.529 --> 18:03.871
Colton's saying this
party is one big photo op.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.217
What?
That's ridiculous.

18:06.522 --> 18:08.042
Oh, my God, it's true!

18:08.129 --> 18:09.614
It is! It is!

18:09.701 --> 18:11.036
You kids don't get it.

18:11.123 --> 18:13.738
I mean, everybody that I work with
has such beautiful photo feeds.

18:13.825 --> 18:16.510
Every weekend,
this family's petting a manta ray,

18:16.597 --> 18:19.949
that family's jumping off a
dune during a fireworks display.

18:20.036 --> 18:22.591
Where do they find
these fireworks dunes?

18:22.678 --> 18:25.527
We're all looking for
our fireworks dunes, bro.

18:25.614 --> 18:27.404
So, what are we
gonna do here?

18:28.053 --> 18:30.964
All right, Colton,
one last gift and no pictures.

18:31.051 --> 18:31.841
Nice.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.597
So we just take pictures
with our eyes,

18:33.684 --> 18:35.155
and save them
to our brains?

18:35.242 --> 18:37.595
God, the resolution
of my eyes is so good.

18:37.682 --> 18:39.535
- You're doing great, guys.
- I've been taking pictures

18:39.622 --> 18:41.370
of the inside of my
pocket this whole time

18:41.457 --> 18:42.733
and I think
I posted them all.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.142
I'm liking them, I'm liking them.

18:44.229 --> 18:45.509
God, we're sick.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.240
Oh, crap. Go, go, go, go!

18:49.327 --> 18:52.246
- Oh, oh, oh, shoot them!
- I'm not shooting somebody

18:52.333 --> 18:55.092
because
my mother tells me to, again.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.942
- Ugh, these bozos.
- There's the quilt thief.

18:59.029 --> 19:00.718
- The quief.
- Bob Belcher?

19:00.805 --> 19:03.888
I thought that was your car.
I didn't figure you for a quief.

19:03.975 --> 19:06.091
Stop saying that like
it means "quilt thief."

19:06.178 --> 19:07.903
Hi. I'm the director of exhibitions.

19:07.990 --> 19:10.746
The sewing ceremony for the
quilt celebrating town history,

19:10.833 --> 19:13.435
- is that still happening, or...?
- It's happening.

19:13.522 --> 19:15.481
But this woman will
play no part in it.

19:15.568 --> 19:16.874
Hand over the quilt, Edith.

19:16.961 --> 19:19.459
- Come and take it, Lillian.
- Yeah, bring it.

19:19.546 --> 19:21.753
Now, now, no need for this
to get nasty.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.214
Give the quilt to me,
nice and easy.

19:24.301 --> 19:28.192
Wait, everybody.
Edith's square, just give it a chance.

19:28.279 --> 19:30.535
Listen, I-I know what
Edith did looks bad.

19:30.622 --> 19:33.185
And I know she's difficult,
possibly horrible.

19:33.272 --> 19:35.248
And yes, Edith wants to
put freaks on the quilt,

19:35.335 --> 19:37.241
and that might not sound
very pretty.

19:37.328 --> 19:38.669
Oh, enough!
What on earth

19:38.756 --> 19:40.190
does Edith see
in this man?

19:40.277 --> 19:43.417
But Edith knew the freaks,
and they were regular people.

19:43.504 --> 19:44.802
They were good people.

19:44.889 --> 19:46.264
Sometimes
we judge people

19:46.351 --> 19:48.597
on what we think we know
about them, but that's wrong.

19:48.684 --> 19:50.947
Just take a look at
Edith's square.

19:51.413 --> 19:52.802
Beautiful needlework.

19:52.889 --> 19:54.731
Wonderful detail
on the nipples.

19:54.818 --> 19:57.785
So, who votes to give this
quilt to the Wharf Arts Center?

19:57.920 --> 19:59.288
Do you vote on things?

19:59.375 --> 20:00.291
- No!
- We vote.

20:00.378 --> 20:02.157
- Sometimes we vote.
- No, we don't!

20:02.244 --> 20:04.277
- All those in favor?
- Aye.

20:04.364 --> 20:06.842
All those opposed? Nay!

20:06.929 --> 20:09.878
Sorry, Lillian. Looks like
the freaks stay on the quilt.

20:09.965 --> 20:11.217
Staying on the quilt!

20:11.304 --> 20:12.514
- Yes!
- Uh, Bob?

20:12.601 --> 20:14.645
My mom's all
riled up about this.

20:14.732 --> 20:16.951
I was wondering if, uh,
you could help me out?

20:17.061 --> 20:18.442
Get in the car, perp.

20:18.529 --> 20:20.410
You're making a big mistake,
Bosco.

20:20.497 --> 20:22.402
Yeah, we're not going
quietly.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.038
Punk-ass
Po-Po.

20:24.287 --> 20:26.325
Thanks. I'll drive
you around for a while,

20:26.412 --> 20:27.960
then drop you off
somewhere inconvenient.

20:28.076 --> 20:30.967
And let that be a lesson
to you crazy quiefs.

20:31.955 --> 20:33.573
So you spent your whole day
with Edith?

20:33.660 --> 20:35.302
- How was that?
- Actually great.

20:35.389 --> 20:37.911
You guys spent your whole day at
that weird party. How was that?

20:37.998 --> 20:40.738
It was medium fun, actually.
I may take up nose picking.

20:40.825 --> 20:43.023
- Godspeed.
- I had a big day, too.

20:43.110 --> 20:45.356
I taught Teddy
how to stop hating sushi.

20:45.443 --> 20:46.636
Really?
How-how'd you do that?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.771
Well, I mean,
I kind of taught him.

20:48.897 --> 20:51.717
Great place.
So glad we're eating here.

20:51.804 --> 20:54.342
And I-I will have
some sushi.

20:54.492 --> 20:55.600
Mmm.

20:56.014 --> 20:57.305
Ow. What the...?

20:57.412 --> 20:58.679
Ooh, guacamole!

20:59.748 --> 21:00.869
