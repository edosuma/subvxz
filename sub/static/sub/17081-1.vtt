02:29.105 --> 02:32.723
<i>It was a quiet day at the
Rigby Reardon Detective Agency.</i>

02:32.859 --> 02:37.604
<i>I had a hangover, and business was
so slow I was rereading old newspapers.</i>

02:37.739 --> 02:41.238
<i>I was even thinking of closing up
the office for a few days...</i>

02:41.367 --> 02:44.368
<i>...when all of a sudden...</i>

02:58.926 --> 03:00.883
- Mr Reardon?
- That's right.

03:01.721 --> 03:03.760
My...

03:03.889 --> 03:06.131
...my name... my...

03:17.486 --> 03:21.947
<i>In all my years in the business,
I'd never seen anything like her.</i>

03:50.769 --> 03:54.683
<i>Was she real? There was
only one way to find out.</i>

03:56.650 --> 03:58.808
<i>But I remembered Marlowe's words.</i>

04:04.032 --> 04:06.321
What the hell does Marlowe know?

04:07.202 --> 04:10.156
<i>She was real all right.</i>

04:13.500 --> 04:16.204
What are you doing?

04:16.336 --> 04:18.827
Adjusting your breasts.

04:18.964 --> 04:22.961
You fainted and they...
shifted all outta whack.

04:26.888 --> 04:29.296
- There.
- Thank you.

04:30.141 --> 04:32.430
You're welcome.

04:37.857 --> 04:42.685
Thank you. I... I apologise
for my dramatic entrance.

04:42.821 --> 04:46.439
It's just when I saw
the... newspaper headlines...

04:50.036 --> 04:54.283
- You must be quite a Dodgers fan.
- No, I saw... the <i>front</i> page.

05:06.344 --> 05:09.261
- What's your name, Dollface?
- Juliet Forrest.

05:10.348 --> 05:12.387
Forrest...

05:13.100 --> 05:16.766
Daughter of the big cheesemaker.
You could use a cup of my famous java.

05:18.231 --> 05:21.516
Cheese was Daddy's hobby.
He was a scientist.

05:22.485 --> 05:25.818
- Quite an accident he had.
- That's what I came to see you about.

05:25.946 --> 05:29.066
You don't think it was an accident.
You think he was murdered.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.607
How did you know?

05:32.078 --> 05:35.363
It's my business to know,
Miss Forrest. Sit down.

05:39.043 --> 05:41.285
What makes you think
it wasn't an accident?

05:41.420 --> 05:44.089
Just before it... it happened...

05:45.090 --> 05:50.048
...he behaved very erratically, writing
out lists of names, dozens of them.

05:50.179 --> 05:53.844
He wrote them on blotters
and scratch pads, whatever was handy.

05:53.974 --> 05:56.928
Here's one of the lists... or part of one.

05:57.978 --> 06:00.434
It's from a dollar bill.

06:02.566 --> 06:06.895
Somehow I got the feeling he was
the victim of a giant conspiracy.

06:09.698 --> 06:13.565
You deducted murder
and a giant conspiracy from <i>this?</i>

06:13.702 --> 06:16.988
You think I'm too impulsive,
don't you, Mr Reardon?

06:17.122 --> 06:19.364
Maybe.

06:19.917 --> 06:22.158
Maybe not.

06:23.462 --> 06:28.088
If you want me to investigate
your father's death, I get $10 a day.

06:28.216 --> 06:30.624
Plus expenses.

06:31.928 --> 06:34.965
Will $200 be enough
in advance, Mr Reardon?

06:35.098 --> 06:38.550
- For $200 I'd shoot my grandmother.
- That won't be necessary.

06:38.685 --> 06:43.762
You never can tell. On my last case, I
had to throw my brother out of a plane.

06:43.899 --> 06:46.603
Where'd your father
keep his correspondence?

06:46.735 --> 06:50.649
He had a small private office downtown.
Here's the key.

06:52.240 --> 06:55.905
Thank you, Mr Reardon.
I appreciate this.

06:56.578 --> 06:58.866
- Miss Forrest?
- Yes?

06:58.997 --> 07:02.911
Save me some shoe leather if you
told me what address this key fits.

07:03.042 --> 07:05.996
It was 429 Firehouse Row.

07:06.129 --> 07:08.798
Pretty seedy part of town
for a renowned scientist.

07:08.923 --> 07:11.841
It was the only place
he could experiment with cheese...

07:11.968 --> 07:15.503
...without the smell
bothering the neighbours.

07:15.638 --> 07:18.094
I'll see what I can turn up.

07:22.061 --> 07:24.731
Good day, Mr Reardon.

07:26.149 --> 07:30.229
<i>On my way to Firehouse Row,
I tried not to think of Juliet Forrest.</i>

07:30.361 --> 07:32.105
<i>I hadn't seen a body like that...</i>

07:32.238 --> 07:36.485
<i>... since I'd solved the case of
the murdered girl with the big tits.</i>

07:37.452 --> 07:40.488
<i>I had no trouble finding
Dr Forrest's cheese lab.</i>

07:40.621 --> 07:42.947
<i>It smelled like the number on the door.</i>

07:43.833 --> 07:46.324
<i>Inside, I turned up
something interesting.</i>

07:48.879 --> 07:53.755
"To John Forrest, a dear man who, like
his cheeses, gets stronger with age."

07:53.884 --> 07:55.960
"Love, Kitty."

07:56.095 --> 07:59.962
So the old renowned scientist
was getting a little on the side.

08:12.653 --> 08:15.144
"Enemies of Carlotta."

08:15.614 --> 08:18.105
"Friends of Carlotta."

08:23.622 --> 08:25.828
"Kitty Collins"?

08:32.965 --> 08:34.625
Sounds like company.

08:41.849 --> 08:44.304
Exterminator.

08:45.519 --> 08:47.761
Just a minute.

08:54.152 --> 08:55.896
Come in.

08:59.991 --> 09:02.233
Sit down.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.948
There's some cookies on the table.

09:12.963 --> 09:15.288
Have one.

09:19.928 --> 09:22.170
Good, aren't they?

09:29.729 --> 09:33.561
Guess to be a really good exterminator
you have to enjoy killing things.

09:33.691 --> 09:35.067
Yeah.

10:37.546 --> 10:40.713
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Forrest.

10:41.300 --> 10:45.380
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Mr Reardon. Tell her I've been shot.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.172
Very good, sir.

10:47.306 --> 10:50.675
- May I tell her by whom?
- No. I don't know myself.

10:52.353 --> 10:56.433
Are you all right? You look
as though you're going to faint.

10:56.565 --> 10:59.021
Faint? Ha!

10:59.860 --> 11:01.899
Never.

11:03.155 --> 11:05.480
- Catch me.
- Sorry.

11:05.949 --> 11:08.619
I'm a butler... not a catcher.

11:17.753 --> 11:20.623
Dollface...

11:24.301 --> 11:26.543
What are you doing?!

11:32.934 --> 11:35.390
It should feel better now.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.983
- Where'd you learn <i>that?</i>
- At camp.

11:43.445 --> 11:48.071
- You learned that at girls' camp?
- It's really for snakebite, but...

11:48.199 --> 11:50.322
...I find it works for everything.

11:50.618 --> 11:55.660
You mumbled about Kitty Collins
and Swede Anderson being on a list.

11:55.790 --> 11:59.491
- "Friends of Carlotta"?
- That's right. Do you know them?

12:02.088 --> 12:04.294
Kitty was...

12:04.757 --> 12:09.087
...Kitty was someone Daddy
trifled with after Mother dried up.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.676
And Swede was Kitty's boyfriend.

12:12.599 --> 12:15.090
Where are they now?

12:16.144 --> 12:18.551
The last I heard,
they were in Santa Barbara.

12:18.688 --> 12:22.021
He used to be a boxer.
Now he works in a gas station...

12:22.150 --> 12:24.273
...and she sings in a private club.

12:28.406 --> 12:32.534
You may be interested in this.
I found it in Daddy's study.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.241
"Thanks for the check.
In case I'm indisposed...

12:37.373 --> 12:41.418
...the dollar you gave me for safekeeping
is in the top of the sugar bowl."

12:41.544 --> 12:43.702
- "Shh."
- Why?

12:44.422 --> 12:46.545
No. This.

12:47.008 --> 12:51.753
No, no, no. That's not "Shh."
It's S-H-H. Samuel H Hastings.

12:51.887 --> 12:54.295
My brother-in-law. Or at least he was.

12:54.432 --> 12:58.299
He and my sister Leona are separated.
He's a hopeless drunk.

12:58.436 --> 13:00.808
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

13:02.231 --> 13:04.900
Get your sister Leona for me.

13:05.025 --> 13:06.650
All right.

13:06.777 --> 13:09.529
I'm afraid she may
not be very much help.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.905
- She's very disturbed.
- How disturbed?

13:13.033 --> 13:15.904
She's been diagnosed
as a paranoid hypochondriac.

13:16.036 --> 13:19.654
- Doctors think she may be faking.
- I'll know after one word if she is.

13:23.168 --> 13:24.912
- Hello?
- She's faking.

13:25.045 --> 13:29.209
Mrs Hastings? My name's Reardon.
Sorry to hear your father's passed on.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.046
No, he hasn't.
He won't be back till Sunday.

13:32.302 --> 13:35.007
Sunday? You don't understand,
Mrs Hastings.

13:35.138 --> 13:37.676
I'm investigating your father's death.

13:37.808 --> 13:41.852
My father called me from Chicago
tonight. He never mentioned a word!

13:41.979 --> 13:44.648
Maybe it slipped his mind.

13:44.773 --> 13:47.976
Look, uh, your father
<i>is</i> dead, Mrs Hastings.

13:48.110 --> 13:51.276
Your sister Juliet feels
his death wasn't an accident.

13:51.405 --> 13:53.527
What are you talking about?

13:53.657 --> 13:56.408
<i>I had a long talk with him
just a little while ago.</i>

13:56.535 --> 14:01.410
<i>- He told me terrible things about you.</i>
- Listen, you phony fruitcake!

14:03.333 --> 14:07.117
Sorry I called you a fruitcake.
I just don't have time to listen to...

14:07.254 --> 14:09.709
All right, don't listen! Who cares?

14:10.924 --> 14:13.960
Your sister has a lot to learn
about phone courtesy.

14:14.094 --> 14:16.252
You got any idea
how I could locate Sam?

14:16.388 --> 14:19.258
You might ask the bartenders
along 5th Street.

14:19.391 --> 14:21.846
I'll call you if I turn up anything.

14:23.186 --> 14:28.144
Oh... If I'm not home, leave a message
with the butler or the cleaning woman.

14:32.111 --> 14:34.567
Cleaning woman.

14:36.199 --> 14:38.606
Cleaning woman.

14:39.243 --> 14:41.485
Cleaning woman.

14:42.372 --> 14:45.823
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

14:46.084 --> 14:48.491
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

14:48.753 --> 14:50.959
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

15:07.647 --> 15:09.639
Sorry.

15:12.193 --> 15:14.600
Why did you do that?

15:19.075 --> 15:21.696
When I was seven years old...

15:22.369 --> 15:25.039
...my father ran off with the cleaning...

15:29.752 --> 15:31.744
My mother died of a broken heart.

15:32.880 --> 15:35.750
Now every time
someone says cleaning...

15:42.973 --> 15:46.307
...I go berserk.
- Oh! You poor dear.

15:47.311 --> 15:49.849
I don't blame you for strangling me.

15:50.814 --> 15:53.305
I'll never say it again.

15:54.401 --> 15:56.441
Thanks.

15:58.697 --> 16:00.939
So long, Dollface.

16:10.667 --> 16:14.001
<i>I legged it down 5th Street
looking for Samuel H Hastings.</i>

16:14.129 --> 16:17.046
<i>It was a street of frustrated hopes
and broken dreams.</i>

16:17.174 --> 16:22.464
<i>Everything was cheap, cut-rate.
Even the prostitutes were having a sale.</i>

16:22.596 --> 16:27.590
<i>There was no problem finding Hastings.
He owed money to every bartender.</i>

16:27.726 --> 16:32.186
<i>He was staying at the Hotel Ward on
5th Street. It used to be on 8th Street...</i>

16:32.314 --> 16:36.892
<i>... but they took so many rubber cheques,
it bounced all the way across town.</i>

16:37.027 --> 16:39.482
<i>I went to his room and knocked.</i>

16:51.666 --> 16:54.952
- Hastings? Sam Hastings?
- Who is it?

16:55.086 --> 16:58.537
My name is Reardon.
I... have a proposition for ya.

16:59.716 --> 17:01.958
But not today. Does it have to be today?

17:02.093 --> 17:04.631
- Yeah.
- Come on Monday.

17:05.680 --> 17:09.724
- I got that money for ya.
- What money?

17:09.851 --> 17:12.805
There's a dollar bill
hidden in your sugar bowl.

17:12.936 --> 17:15.393
I'll give you five bucks for it.

17:16.148 --> 17:19.647
- You could buy a lotta booze with that.
- Just a minute.

17:24.323 --> 17:26.648
Look in the top.

17:40.548 --> 17:44.759
It fits perfectly.
Most of the names are illegible...

17:44.885 --> 17:48.420
...but I can work out
Kitty Collins and Swede Anderson.

17:49.515 --> 17:51.554
But what does "FOC" mean?

17:51.684 --> 17:56.725
It's a slang word. When a man and a
woman are in love, the man puts his...

17:56.856 --> 17:59.311
No, no. Written here. F-O-C.

17:59.900 --> 18:04.028
Oh. Unless I miss my guess,
that stands for "Friends of Carlotta".

18:05.656 --> 18:08.941
- I'm impressed.
- You think <i>that's</i> impressive...

18:14.289 --> 18:17.623
<i>There I was, standing like a kid
doing corny tricks for her...</i>

18:17.751 --> 18:21.037
<i>... driving miles out of my way
just to see her.</i>

18:21.255 --> 18:23.294
<i>Why?</i>

18:24.091 --> 18:26.546
What are you thinking, Mr Reardon?

18:28.220 --> 18:31.553
So long, Dollface. I'll be
in Santa Barbara if you need me.

18:40.023 --> 18:43.522
<i>I found out Kitty Collins
was working at the Brentwood Room.</i>

18:43.652 --> 18:45.312
<i>The Brentwood Room.</i>

18:45.445 --> 18:49.573
<i>Where rich women go to meet rich men
so they can have rich kids.</i>

18:59.292 --> 19:01.285
Miss Collins?

19:01.419 --> 19:05.499
<i>Kitty wouldn't give me any information
if she thought I was a private eye...</i>

19:05.632 --> 19:07.091
Excuse me.

19:07.217 --> 19:10.586
<i>... so I decided to act like
a big-shot movie producer.</i>

19:11.471 --> 19:14.922
- My name's Reardon. I make movies.
- How wonderful of you.

19:15.392 --> 19:19.057
- You like boxing pictures?
- I'm afraid I've never seen one.

19:19.187 --> 19:24.893
I'm casting a big boxing picture at RKO.
I'm looking for a singer. You interested?

19:25.026 --> 19:29.071
The idea of two men beating
each other to a pulp makes me ill.

19:30.073 --> 19:32.646
Well, I'm also doing a religious picture.

19:32.784 --> 19:35.987
The Story of Saint... Betty.

19:37.622 --> 19:42.082
You know, the... nun who
taught the lepers how to sing.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.333
- How wonderful of you.
- Thanks.

19:47.131 --> 19:50.381
John Hay Forrest said
you were a friend of Carlotta's.

19:50.510 --> 19:52.502
Will you excuse me?

19:52.637 --> 19:56.053
<i>I must have hit a nerve.
She went white as a ghost.</i>

19:56.515 --> 20:00.465
<i>The next day I tailed Kitty Collins
to a fancy restaurant.</i>

20:03.731 --> 20:07.811
<i>Midway through the meal, she noticed
me and did a pretty strange thing.</i>

20:07.943 --> 20:10.434
<i>She took off her brooch and ditched it.</i>

20:11.197 --> 20:13.866
<i>I had a pretty good idea where.</i>

20:28.714 --> 20:31.501
Hold it, pal. I'm from
the health department.

20:31.634 --> 20:35.845
We have a report that your soup
has too much jewellery in it.

20:56.992 --> 20:59.909
"EOC." Enemies of Carlotta.

21:02.372 --> 21:06.073
<i>The only name on the list that
wasn't crossed out was Swede Anderson.</i>

21:06.209 --> 21:10.041
<i>I decided to drop in on him
before they crossed him out too.</i>

21:10.172 --> 21:12.330
<i>Swede wasn't living in luxury.</i>

21:12.466 --> 21:16.297
<i>As a matter of fact, for a moment,
I thought he wasn't living at all.</i>

21:18.847 --> 21:20.674
Swede?

21:22.642 --> 21:25.727
Sorry, Swede. I thought
you'd been murdered.

21:27.063 --> 21:29.305
Come on, wake up!

21:30.817 --> 21:32.228
Come on, Swede.

21:34.612 --> 21:37.234
You need a cup of my java.

22:59.530 --> 23:02.981
You're up. Good. The java
will be ready in a minute.

23:21.218 --> 23:24.005
This is never gonna heal.

23:35.273 --> 23:40.019
Anyway, my guess is by now Kitty
Collins is a million miles from here.

23:41.321 --> 23:44.820
Do you think Swede was killed by
the same man who murdered my father?

23:44.950 --> 23:49.493
Hold it, Dollface. No one's proved
your father's been murdered...

23:51.373 --> 23:53.246
...yet.

23:53.375 --> 23:56.791
But you may be right about
this being a conspiracy.

23:56.920 --> 24:00.787
It's big. Maybe too big
for me to handle alone.

24:01.466 --> 24:03.589
Get me a cup of java, will ya?

24:07.931 --> 24:09.888
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, Marlowe?</i>

24:10.016 --> 24:12.305
- Oh, hello, Bernie.
- No, it's me, Rigby.

24:12.435 --> 24:13.431
<i>What's up?</i>

24:13.561 --> 24:17.096
I'm on an important case. I need
your help. How soon can you get here?

24:17.232 --> 24:21.395
- I haven't had breakfast.
- Breakfast? You're late for lunch, pal.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.853
<i>- It's two o'clock.</i>
- Two o'clock?

24:23.988 --> 24:26.942
Hustle on over here.
I'll make you a cup of my famous java.

24:27.075 --> 24:30.693
- I'd rather buy my own.
- Suit yourself. See ya in a half-hour.

24:30.828 --> 24:33.782
And Marlowe. Wear a tie, for God's sake.

24:37.627 --> 24:39.750
What's that?

24:39.879 --> 24:41.918
I found it in Daddy's desk.

24:43.966 --> 24:48.046
It looks like a key to one of
those lockers at the train station.

24:48.179 --> 24:52.011
Number's been filed off.
What's it say on that envelope?

24:52.975 --> 24:55.217
"Most recent rat."

24:56.812 --> 24:59.979
- Very clever.
- You understand what it means?

25:00.107 --> 25:03.891
Just a hunch. You know the Chinese
have a different animal for every year?

25:04.028 --> 25:07.148
- Yes.
- Unless I miss my guess...

25:07.281 --> 25:10.365
...the most recent
Year of the Rat was 1936.

25:11.202 --> 25:14.156
This is the key to locker number 1936.

25:15.414 --> 25:18.368
- You're a very smart man.
- So was Abraham Lincoln.

25:18.500 --> 25:22.000
Look what happened to him.
Smart can get you killed.

25:25.549 --> 25:27.791
I hope not.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.550
Sometimes I feel I would like to...

25:34.683 --> 25:37.174
<i>You'd like to what? Kiss me?</i>

25:37.853 --> 25:39.727
<i>Yeah, that would be nice.</i>

25:39.855 --> 25:44.102
<i>It would give me a chance to tell her
I was starting to feel something for her.</i>

25:44.234 --> 25:46.523
<i>Something warm and squishy.</i>

25:46.987 --> 25:52.147
<i>But a man in my business can't
take on a wife, have a bunch of kids.</i>

25:53.827 --> 25:56.947
- We wouldn't have to have kids.
- What?

26:00.292 --> 26:02.534
Look, this is getting us nowhere.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.294
But thanks anyway.

26:04.421 --> 26:08.335
You'd better go now. Marlowe's
coming over here to talk.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.759
If you need me, just call.

26:18.393 --> 26:20.765
You know how to dial, don't you?

26:20.896 --> 26:25.557
You just put your finger in the hole,
and make tiny little circles.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.453
Come on in. It's open.

26:46.754 --> 26:48.996
Hello, Marlowe.

26:49.132 --> 26:52.049
Dammit. You didn't do what I told ya.

26:52.594 --> 26:56.128
I hate that dumb way of wearing
your shirt buttoned with no tie.

26:56.264 --> 26:58.755
Let me get you a tie.

26:59.350 --> 27:03.182
Here. This one's blue,
but you can wear it with brown.

27:03.312 --> 27:05.982
- You annoy me.
- I annoy you?

27:06.107 --> 27:09.523
You come in here with no tie...
Are you drunk?

27:09.652 --> 27:12.439
- How many have you had?
- One martini.

27:12.572 --> 27:15.193
- I knew I was gonna see you.
- Sit down.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.278
Here's what I want you to do.

27:27.044 --> 27:30.627
Here's a list of names I found in a
bowl of soup. Don't ask me to explain.

27:30.756 --> 27:33.426
I think they're all dead.
I want you to check 'em out.

27:33.551 --> 27:37.050
And Marlowe? Put this on
for me, huh? As a favour.

27:37.179 --> 27:39.421
It's a clip-on.

27:42.893 --> 27:47.389
<i>I put Marlowe to work checking Kitty's
list against recent unsolved murders...</i>

27:47.523 --> 27:49.812
<i>... while I yellow-cabbed it
to the station...</i>

27:49.942 --> 27:53.774
<i>... to see how Dr Forrest's key
would fit into the puzzle.</i>

27:53.904 --> 27:57.238
<i>I sashayed over to locker number 1936.</i>

27:58.701 --> 28:02.532
<i>The key fit like a glove.
As I opened the locker...</i>

28:02.663 --> 28:06.245
<i>... I noticed a handsome guy
in a grey pinstripe watching me.</i>

28:06.375 --> 28:10.538
<i>It seemed I wasn't the only one who was
interested in the contents of that locker.</i>

28:10.963 --> 28:14.497
<i>Inside were two long lists of
Carlotta's friends and enemies.</i>

28:14.633 --> 28:17.302
<i>The first name that jumped out
was FX Huberman...</i>

28:17.427 --> 28:20.677
<i>... number 46 Bay Court Drive,
Grunion Point.</i>

28:21.765 --> 28:25.845
<i>I decided to take a little train ride
and visit Mr Huberman.</i>

28:26.520 --> 28:29.604
<i>I knew "Handsome" would follow me,
so to throw him off...</i>

28:29.731 --> 28:33.432
<i>... I cleverly ducked into
the men's room and lost him.</i>

28:34.319 --> 28:38.780
<i>There was no way he could follow me
unless I had toilet paper on my shoe.</i>

28:41.535 --> 28:43.574
Damn!

28:48.708 --> 28:51.579
<i>It wasn't really toilet paper,
it was a seat cover...</i>

28:51.711 --> 28:55.412
<i>... but it was enough for
a smart guy to make the connection.</i>

28:56.424 --> 28:58.381
<i>As soon as we went into a tunnel...</i>

28:58.510 --> 29:03.255
<i>... Handsome popped in and started
looking for a match... in my pockets.</i>

29:04.390 --> 29:08.009
Oh! Was that your leg?
- No, it was my face.

29:08.144 --> 29:10.351
I had no idea we were
going into a tunnel.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.722
I'm sure.

29:13.399 --> 29:15.439
I thought the compartment was empty.

29:15.568 --> 29:17.691
Yeah, right. Uh-huh, sure.

29:19.155 --> 29:23.069
- I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you.
- It's all right.

29:26.079 --> 29:28.570
To what do I owe
the pleasure of your company?

29:28.706 --> 29:32.040
The man in the next compartment's
smoking a vile cigar.

29:32.168 --> 29:35.453
I had to come in here.
You don't smoke, do you?

29:35.588 --> 29:38.755
- No, I have tuberculosis.
- Oh, thank heavens for that.

29:38.883 --> 29:41.967
After last night,
my head couldn't stand it.

29:46.307 --> 29:51.016
<i>I didn't want him to know where I was
going so I decided to put him away fast.</i>

29:52.772 --> 29:54.895
<i>I always carry my harmonica.</i>

29:55.024 --> 29:58.938
<i>It's lighter than an accordion,
and more powerful than a sleeping pill.</i>

30:05.743 --> 30:09.823
<i>I left him napping like a baby
when I ducked out at Grunion Point.</i>

30:14.627 --> 30:19.170
Here's three bucks if you can get
this cab to 46 Bay Court in ten minutes.

30:23.469 --> 30:25.924
Follow that cab!

30:28.265 --> 30:30.341
<i>It was a pretty clever thing I did.</i>

30:30.476 --> 30:35.221
<i>By taking the only two cabs, I made
sure Handsome couldn't follow me.</i>

30:37.357 --> 30:40.358
<i>When I arrived at Mr Huberman's,
I was surprised.</i>

30:40.485 --> 30:44.732
<i>Mr Huberman turned out to be
a sexy dame who was throwing a party.</i>

30:44.865 --> 30:49.159
<i>She didn't even ask me what I wanted,
just made me feel real welcome.</i>

30:53.749 --> 30:57.580
How about you, handsome?
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

30:57.711 --> 31:00.249
Maybe. I've been somewhere before.

31:00.797 --> 31:04.581
It's nice of you to invite me.
I feel a little like a party crasher.

31:04.718 --> 31:07.125
I like party crashers.

31:07.262 --> 31:09.883
I like classy dames with bedroom eyes.

31:10.015 --> 31:12.054
You know something? I like you.

31:12.183 --> 31:14.057
I like me too.

31:14.185 --> 31:18.728
When these people leave, maybe...
you and I can have a party of our own.

31:18.857 --> 31:21.264
Oh, I... I have to think that over.

31:22.902 --> 31:24.183
<i>She was a fast thinker.</i>

31:24.779 --> 31:29.240
I'm very sorry. You all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

31:30.785 --> 31:33.027
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:54.684 --> 31:57.139
Stuffy in here, isn't it?

31:59.063 --> 32:02.147
<i>Suddenly I realised
she'd slipped me a Mickey.</i>

32:02.275 --> 32:06.937
<i>My lips felt like two manhole covers.
My tongue felt like it had hair on it.</i>

32:07.071 --> 32:10.570
<i>My ears started to ring. I felt like a dog.</i>

32:13.244 --> 32:14.952
Woof!

32:15.079 --> 32:17.072
Woof, Huberman, woof!

32:17.206 --> 32:19.875
Come on. Let's go out dancin'.

32:20.876 --> 32:24.411
You put on your black dress,
and I'll go shave my tongue.

32:33.681 --> 32:36.302
# Barbasol, Barbasol

32:36.767 --> 32:38.807
# No brush, no lather, no rub-in

32:38.936 --> 32:40.644
# Wet your razor then begin

32:40.771 --> 32:44.187
# Barbasol, Barbasol

32:44.316 --> 32:46.854
# 0ompah, oompah, oompah, oompah

33:16.598 --> 33:18.223
Come on, FX. I'm ready!

33:19.726 --> 33:21.968
Let's go dancing.

33:35.450 --> 33:36.565
Hold it!

33:37.285 --> 33:39.741
Sorry, Dollface.

33:40.038 --> 33:43.739
- How did <i>you</i> get here?
- Your door was open, so I walked in.

33:44.668 --> 33:48.416
- I've been trying to call you all night.
- How did I get here?

33:48.546 --> 33:51.962
- I guess you must have crawled.
- Oh, God!

33:53.218 --> 33:55.756
- Oh, no, that's OK.
- It's just a little alcohol.

33:55.887 --> 33:57.844
- They don't hurt.
- Don't be a baby.

33:57.972 --> 34:00.380
Get back!

34:04.187 --> 34:06.559
What's up?

34:07.857 --> 34:10.478
Sam Hastings is dead.

34:10.610 --> 34:13.101
Poor rummy. How did he get it?

34:13.237 --> 34:16.606
Fell out of a window
reaching for a bottle of whisky.

34:16.741 --> 34:20.904
He could have been pushed. I'll have
Marlowe check his back for fingerprints.

34:21.036 --> 34:23.574
- Anything else?
- Yes.

34:23.706 --> 34:26.742
I found another note
Daddy wrote to himself.

34:26.876 --> 34:28.703
"NYTAG-216."

34:28.835 --> 34:31.706
I think it's a New York
licence plate number.

34:31.839 --> 34:35.208
Not bad, Dollface.
Unless I'm... Ohh! Agh!

34:35.342 --> 34:37.583
Careful. Let me get you some alcohol.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.760
No!

34:46.103 --> 34:48.974
It's not N-Y TAG. It's N-Y-T.

34:49.940 --> 34:52.181
<i>New York Times.</i>

34:57.907 --> 34:59.864
So what's "A-G"?

34:59.992 --> 35:03.906
- Standard library talk for August.
- And 216?

35:04.330 --> 35:08.030
Stands for the August 2nd issue,
page one, column six.

35:09.251 --> 35:11.493
Extension 20, please.

35:11.962 --> 35:14.121
Hi. It's me, Rigby.

35:14.256 --> 35:16.213
Sorry, Hot Legs, I've been busy.

35:16.342 --> 35:18.797
You sashay over to
your <i>New York Times</i> file...

35:18.927 --> 35:23.007
...read me what's on page one,
column six of the August 2nd issue...

35:23.140 --> 35:25.713
...maybe I'll wine and dine you
some night soon.

35:25.851 --> 35:26.882
I'll wait.

35:27.019 --> 35:29.426
You'd wine and dine her for information?

35:29.563 --> 35:31.935
Her? Him.

35:32.065 --> 35:34.735
Yeah... Then read me the whole article.

35:38.363 --> 35:40.605
<i>"Immer Essen".</i>

35:41.450 --> 35:43.822
Walter Neff's the owner.

35:44.828 --> 35:47.284
Thanks, Hot Legs. I owe you a big one.

35:47.914 --> 35:50.156
<i>Immer essen.</i>

35:53.086 --> 35:55.660
<i>Immer essen.</i>
That means "always eating".

35:55.881 --> 35:58.288
- What language?
- German.

35:58.967 --> 36:01.802
It's also the name of
a South American cruise ship.

36:01.928 --> 36:06.886
I know! When Sam Hastings
and my sister separated last July...

36:07.767 --> 36:10.175
...he took a South American tour
on that ship.

36:10.312 --> 36:12.434
Very interesting.

36:12.564 --> 36:16.063
Right after that tour,
the company cancelled its cruises.

36:16.192 --> 36:18.862
Now Sam Hastings is dead.

36:18.987 --> 36:23.530
- I don't see the connection.
- I don't either. That's what bothers me.

36:36.337 --> 36:38.579
Hello?

36:40.133 --> 36:42.006
- Who is it?
- This is Marlowe.

36:42.427 --> 36:46.045
Oh, hello, Mr Marlowe.
Would you hold a moment, please?

36:46.931 --> 36:49.387
- It's Marlowe.
- Good.

37:02.071 --> 37:06.816
Hello, Marlowe. Listen, don't check out
those unsolved murders right now.

37:06.951 --> 37:08.030
Yeah? Why not?

37:08.160 --> 37:13.072
I got something more important. You
ever had any dealings with Walter Neff?

37:13.207 --> 37:16.541
Walter Neff. He runs
a South American cruise-ship company.

37:17.586 --> 37:19.378
Good. Tell me about him.

37:19.547 --> 37:22.631
Cruises supermarkets
looking for blondes?

37:24.009 --> 37:26.927
Good. I'll supply the blonde.

37:32.184 --> 37:33.513
One other thing.

37:33.852 --> 37:37.553
If Walter Neff leaves the country,
I may have to take a little boat ride.

37:37.690 --> 37:42.684
If I do, stay off the booze. These
people we're dealing with are killers.

37:42.820 --> 37:46.402
Well, thanks for telling <i>me.</i>
Have a nice trip.

37:46.532 --> 37:49.983
I may not leave right away,
but thanks anyway. And Marlowe?

37:50.119 --> 37:52.444
<i>- You wearin' a tie?</i>
- Goodbye.

37:56.583 --> 37:59.121
- What was <i>that</i> all about?
- Marlowe knows Neff.

37:59.253 --> 38:02.123
Says he's a pushover
for beautiful blondes.

38:02.256 --> 38:04.628
It means we need a female spy.

38:09.805 --> 38:11.797
Why not use me?

38:16.645 --> 38:18.768
Sorry.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.269
You're not blonde enough.

38:34.079 --> 38:37.744
- I can always dye my hair.
- No dice, Dollface. You're a client.

38:37.874 --> 38:42.951
That's one thing I've learned about
clients. Dead ones don't pay their bills.

38:47.092 --> 38:49.380
Is that all you think of me?

38:49.511 --> 38:51.883
Someone who pays you $10 a day?

38:58.228 --> 39:01.679
That's right, Dollface.
To me you're just a meal ticket.

39:04.108 --> 39:06.397
<i>How could I tell her that I was lying?</i>

39:06.527 --> 39:10.525
<i>I'd work for nothing just to watch
her hair bounce as she walked...</i>

39:10.657 --> 39:14.405
<i>... smell her creamy skin,
cradle her head on my shoulder.</i>

39:15.078 --> 39:18.529
<i>Feel the slope of her waist,
the curve of her back...</i>

39:18.664 --> 39:21.749
<i>... and then gently caress
her two beautiful...</i>

39:27.381 --> 39:29.789
I'm sorry.

39:29.926 --> 39:33.045
I just don't like
being called a meal ticket.

39:48.319 --> 39:52.696
<i>As I started my search for a blonde spy,
I tried to get rid of the image of Juliet...</i>

39:52.823 --> 39:56.737
<i>... storming out of my office
with toothpaste on her shoes.</i>

39:58.454 --> 40:02.617
<i>First on my list was Monica Stillpond,
a bombshell who once told me...</i>

40:02.750 --> 40:07.293
<i>... she would do anything
for anybody anywhere at any time.</i>

40:09.506 --> 40:12.128
<i>But muscle gave me
my start in politics.</i>

40:12.259 --> 40:15.593
It was when I was assistant
to old man Zimmerman, the plumber.

40:15.721 --> 40:19.553
- Mr Madvig, you're joking.
- About the plumbing, or the muscle?

40:19.683 --> 40:22.221
I just can't imagine you as a plumber.

40:22.728 --> 40:25.053
<i>She was in the middle
of a fancy dinner party.</i>

40:25.189 --> 40:29.233
<i>But I couldn't waste time being polite.
I caught her attention.</i>

40:32.529 --> 40:36.230
Coffee will be served
in the living room, Mr Madvig.

40:37.451 --> 40:42.658
<i>One thing about Monica: The words
"I can't" weren't in her vocabulary.</i>

40:42.789 --> 40:45.280
Monica, I want you
to do something for me.

40:45.417 --> 40:47.493
I can't.

40:47.627 --> 40:51.411
<i>I guess she had added them
since the last time I'd seen her.</i>

40:52.799 --> 40:56.417
<i>The next one on my list was
Doris Devermont, an old flame of mine.</i>

40:56.553 --> 41:00.218
<i>With her I'd had the most honest
relationship I'd ever had with a woman.</i>

41:00.348 --> 41:04.927
<i>The only thing I'd lied about was my
name. I'd told her I was Teddy Novak...</i>

41:05.061 --> 41:08.561
<i>... so she couldn't track me down
if I got her pregnant.</i>

41:15.822 --> 41:17.945
<i>Doris remembered me, naturally.</i>

41:18.074 --> 41:20.031
How do you do, Mr Novak?

41:20.160 --> 41:25.402
Mr Novak? No hugs, no kisses? We used
to flop into each other's arms, Doris.

41:25.540 --> 41:29.584
Well, don't you think we really ought to
get to know each other all over again?

41:29.711 --> 41:34.289
It's only been five years. You were about
to serve me dinner when I had to leave.

41:34.424 --> 41:36.796
How stupid of me.
You must be famished.

41:36.926 --> 41:40.924
I should have thought of it sooner.
I'll get some coffee and sandwiches.

41:42.223 --> 41:44.631
<i>Coffee and sandwiches.</i>

41:44.767 --> 41:47.934
<i>Now I remembered Doris's
famous stale-bread sandwiches.</i>

41:48.813 --> 41:53.771
<i>She'd buy day-old bread, then toast it
to cover up. I wonder if she's changed.</i>

41:53.901 --> 41:56.772
The bread's none too fresh.
Shall I toast it?

41:57.613 --> 42:00.567
No, thanks.
I gave up stale toast for Lent.

42:01.033 --> 42:03.607
- Lent?
- Nothing.

42:04.370 --> 42:06.363
<i>Same old Doris.</i>

42:06.497 --> 42:09.581
<i>She used to get smoked turkey
so it would keep for months.</i>

42:09.709 --> 42:12.460
<i>When it finally went bad,
she'd feed it to the maid.</i>

42:12.586 --> 42:16.536
I had some smoked turkey. I guess
the cleaning woman had it for her lunch.

42:16.674 --> 42:18.916
Oh, here's some pâté.

42:21.428 --> 42:23.670
Cleaning woman.

42:26.350 --> 42:28.592
Cleaning woman.

42:29.144 --> 42:31.386
Cleaning woman!

42:31.772 --> 42:34.939
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

42:35.442 --> 42:37.768
Cleaning woman! Cleaning woman!

42:53.544 --> 42:54.706
Sorry.

42:57.756 --> 43:02.751
<i>I was too embarrassed to ask Doris for
a favour after I'd tried to strangle her...</i>

43:02.886 --> 43:06.337
<i>... so I went to the next name
in my little black book.</i>

43:06.473 --> 43:11.265
<i>The blondest one on my list was a rich
society dame named Jimmi Sue Altfeld.</i>

43:11.395 --> 43:16.187
<i>I almost hated to use her - she was so
in love with me, it nearly made me sick.</i>

43:16.316 --> 43:18.724
<i>But business was more important.</i>

43:18.860 --> 43:21.861
<i>I wined her and dined her
at the Plantation Club.</i>

43:21.988 --> 43:24.230
<i>Then I made my move.</i>

43:25.408 --> 43:30.035
Last time we saw each other, I left you
alone sitting at a counter at Schwab's.

43:30.830 --> 43:34.034
- You don't hate me for that, do you?
- Of course I don't.

43:34.376 --> 43:36.083
Good...

43:36.211 --> 43:38.880
I'd like to discuss something with you.

43:41.007 --> 43:42.751
- Where to?
- Take me home.

43:43.927 --> 43:47.177
<i>There was no way I was gonna
take her home. Her father hated me.</i>

43:47.305 --> 43:51.599
<i>So I told her to meet me at a motel and
I'd show her something with my hands.</i>

44:24.133 --> 44:26.375
Come in.

44:30.765 --> 44:32.638
Well, Jimmi Sue, you ready?

44:33.559 --> 44:35.967
What are we going to do?

44:36.729 --> 44:39.184
Kinsey from cover to cover.

44:54.955 --> 44:59.534
Has anyone ever told you that your lips
are like two succulent Brussels sprouts...

44:59.668 --> 45:03.796
...waiting to be buttered and bitten?
- Plenty of men have.

45:04.715 --> 45:06.957
Really?

45:08.177 --> 45:09.968
Have these men ever told you...

45:10.095 --> 45:14.971
...that your eyes are like Chinese coins
with dollops of caviar in the centre?

45:15.100 --> 45:17.591
Can't you see how happy
you and I would be here?

45:17.728 --> 45:22.188
Yes, I do. But I want you to come
back to the city with me first.

45:22.316 --> 45:27.772
I'm working on an important case. It's
dangerous, and you'll probably be killed.

45:27.904 --> 45:31.273
- But if you love me, you'll do it.
- Yes, I do love you.

45:31.408 --> 45:36.912
And I love you. And I mean that more
than anything I've ever said in my life.

45:48.258 --> 45:53.134
<i>I rented an apartment and started giving
Jimmi instructions on how to pump Neff.</i>

45:53.263 --> 45:56.299
<i>She took direction
like a pig takes to garbage.</i>

45:56.433 --> 45:58.509
Here's a picture of our Mr Neff.

45:58.643 --> 46:01.312
Do, uh, whatever you have to...

46:01.438 --> 46:04.142
...to find out what happened
on the <i>Immer Essen.</i>

46:04.274 --> 46:07.856
Your father threatened to have me
beat up if I continue to see ya.

46:07.986 --> 46:11.651
Thought I'd drop over there tomorrow
with a little peace offering.

46:12.115 --> 46:14.154
What could I take that'd soften him up?

46:14.284 --> 46:16.739
He never had a dog when he was a boy.

46:17.620 --> 46:19.862
Never had a dog, huh?

46:29.841 --> 46:31.798
Mr Altfeld?

46:35.680 --> 46:38.052
Totally house-broken.

46:38.933 --> 46:41.685
His name is... Ramon.

46:42.061 --> 46:44.303
He's yours.

46:50.152 --> 46:52.608
Get out, thief!

46:52.738 --> 46:57.484
I'm not stealing your daughter. I'm just
borrowing her for an important case.

46:58.035 --> 47:03.374
Don't go near my daughter. Don't try
to see her. Don't write and don't phone.

47:03.499 --> 47:06.204
Can I use her underwear to make soup?

47:06.335 --> 47:08.826
- Get out!
- Mr Altfeld...

47:08.963 --> 47:12.047
...by helping me,
your daughter's life is in danger.

47:12.174 --> 47:15.839
But she may save hundreds of lives.
You wouldn't stand in the way of that.

47:15.970 --> 47:18.009
Why certainly I would!

47:18.305 --> 47:22.848
I'd frame you or kill you...
if it would protect my daughter.

47:23.686 --> 47:27.932
And I brought you a puppy,
something you never had as a boy.

47:28.065 --> 47:30.307
Now get out!

47:30.943 --> 47:33.398
Come on, Ramon.

47:35.697 --> 47:37.773
You don't deserve a puppy.

47:39.618 --> 47:41.409
Wait!

47:42.663 --> 47:44.904
Pick that up.

47:46.291 --> 47:49.494
- But it's all soft and steamy.
- Pick that up!

47:52.547 --> 47:55.003
You're a sick man, Altfeld.

48:02.557 --> 48:07.303
You can make me pick up dog dirt,
but you can't stop me seeing Jimmi Sue.

48:14.194 --> 48:16.649
- You want a puppy?
- I'd love a dog.

48:17.656 --> 48:19.399
Thank you.

48:19.532 --> 48:22.736
- Here's something for you, too.
- Oh, thank you.

48:24.829 --> 48:25.909
Eugh!

48:31.544 --> 48:33.952
Well, Larry, Moe and Curly.

48:38.510 --> 48:40.882
Thanks, Dan.

48:41.012 --> 48:43.930
Not a nice way to treat
a friend of Mr Altfeld's daughter.

48:44.057 --> 48:46.215
There's only one way to treat <i>you.</i>

48:50.521 --> 48:52.810
You got some
pretty smart monkeys here.

48:55.276 --> 48:58.775
I notice this one's wearing
a Phi Beta Kappa key here.

49:01.741 --> 49:05.240
- Ow!
- Your move.

49:05.369 --> 49:07.907
I'm gonna have some sense
beaten into you.

49:08.748 --> 49:13.077
What's he payin' you boys? I'll double it
and we'll beat the shit outta him.

49:13.211 --> 49:15.452
All right, Dan.

49:57.129 --> 49:59.168
Rigby?

50:01.675 --> 50:03.715
Rigby?

50:06.638 --> 50:08.678
Rigby?

50:33.999 --> 50:35.956
Juliet!

50:36.084 --> 50:39.702
Those dirty bastards!
Beating up a woman.

50:42.549 --> 50:45.384
They even knocked
your breasts out of whack.

50:46.303 --> 50:48.342
Rigby?

50:49.180 --> 50:51.850
Juliet... Are you all right?

50:52.350 --> 50:53.975
Oh!

50:54.102 --> 50:56.141
Yes, I'm fine.

50:57.480 --> 51:00.565
- You look awful.
- It's all in a day's work.

51:01.651 --> 51:04.569
No, Rigby. It's not worth it.

51:06.322 --> 51:09.656
- I want you to quit.
- Why? Because I've been roughed up?

51:09.784 --> 51:12.489
You've also been shot and drugged...

51:13.162 --> 51:16.247
...and probably had to go to bed
with women you didn't know.

51:16.374 --> 51:19.873
You're just upset
about me interviewing blondes.

51:20.003 --> 51:22.328
You can forget about it.

51:35.434 --> 51:38.519
I've decided to get
the information myself.

51:40.565 --> 51:42.604
How?

51:44.527 --> 51:46.934
By disguising myself
as a beautiful blonde.

52:11.971 --> 52:14.888
- Do I look like a dame?
- Not as much as I do.

52:15.349 --> 52:19.512
- I haven't turned on the charm yet.
- Rigby, I wish you'd let me go instead.

52:19.645 --> 52:22.562
Have Neff try and feel you up?
No chance, Dollface.

52:22.690 --> 52:25.441
Oh. You don't want
Mr Neff to feel me up?

52:25.567 --> 52:28.936
That doesn't mean you're beginning
to... care for me, does it?

52:29.071 --> 52:31.906
I don't want
any of my clients felt up.

52:32.199 --> 52:37.442
I'm late. Neff cruises supermarkets
every Thursday looking for blondes.

52:37.579 --> 52:40.035
If I'm half the woman I think I am...

52:40.165 --> 52:42.834
...I'll have a date with Neff by tonight.

52:43.877 --> 52:46.166
Good luck.

52:47.047 --> 52:50.712
<i>Neff's favourite hunting ground
was Jerry's Market on Melrose.</i>

52:50.842 --> 52:54.674
<i>I spotted him right away and
sidled down the aisle opposite him.</i>

52:54.805 --> 52:58.008
<i>I was wearing a special perfume
called "Fondle Me".</i>

52:58.141 --> 53:01.973
<i>Its aroma drew Neff to me
like fat to a mother-in-law.</i>

53:05.232 --> 53:09.395
<i>He was a ladies' man, all right.
He made me feel beautiful, alive.</i>

53:10.320 --> 53:13.819
<i>He asked me up to his place,
and I didn't play hard to get.</i>

53:13.949 --> 53:16.190
All right.

53:17.744 --> 53:22.073
<i>On his home ground, Neff was
more aggressive and I played along.</i>

53:25.001 --> 53:29.628
- I'm crazy about you, baby.
- I'm crazy about you too, Walter.

53:29.756 --> 53:31.998
That perfume. What's the name of it?

53:32.133 --> 53:33.925
"Fondle Me".

53:34.052 --> 53:36.091
Silly!

53:36.679 --> 53:38.921
That's the name of the perfume.

53:40.016 --> 53:43.302
- I feel like a drink.
- All I've got is bourbon.

53:43.811 --> 53:46.053
I'll make the drinks.

53:49.692 --> 53:51.934
Sit over there.

54:04.874 --> 54:09.702
<i>I wanted to knock him out fast. I slipped
him 15 milligrams of Aphrodisiamil...</i>

54:09.837 --> 54:13.917
<i>... and hoped it would take effect
before he tried to pick my lock.</i>

54:29.356 --> 54:32.560
Sorry, Walter. That's as far
as I go on a first date.

55:15.152 --> 55:18.568
<i>I didn't know what I was looking for,
but what I found was dynamite.</i>

55:18.697 --> 55:22.397
<i>The passenger list of
the Immer Essen's final cruise.</i>

55:24.119 --> 55:26.491
<i>It was the same as
the Carlotta "Enemies" list.</i>

55:28.498 --> 55:32.448
<i>One name rang a bell. Cody Jarrett,
captain of the Immer Essen.</i>

55:32.586 --> 55:37.746
<i>I went to the public library and looked
up everything I could on Captain Jarrett.</i>

55:39.175 --> 55:42.011
"Framed Because He Knew Too Much."

55:42.137 --> 55:46.300
"But He Refuses to Divulge What
He Knew to Anyone but His Mother."

55:47.267 --> 55:51.217
<i>I hoped to find out why the passengers
on the Immer Essen's final cruise...</i>

55:51.354 --> 55:53.810
<i>... were being knocked off one by one.</i>

55:53.940 --> 55:57.190
<i>They all must have
seen something. But what?</i>

55:58.611 --> 55:59.809
What do you think?

55:59.946 --> 56:02.698
I think you enjoy
dressing up as a woman.

56:02.824 --> 56:05.860
Jarrett's mother's
the only visitor he'll talk to.

56:05.994 --> 56:10.122
And I think I look enough like her
to get a gift on Mother's Day.

56:22.635 --> 56:24.675
Rigby, wait!

56:25.972 --> 56:28.260
Don't... don't call me Rigby.

56:29.142 --> 56:31.430
I'm worried.
Since you were beaten up...

56:31.561 --> 56:35.938
...I've had nightmares about
something awful happening to you.

56:36.065 --> 56:38.521
I care about you, Rigby.

56:40.486 --> 56:42.728
What?

56:42.863 --> 56:45.105
I care about you.

56:48.327 --> 56:50.569
What's the matter?

56:50.704 --> 56:53.112
You. You're the matter.

56:53.791 --> 56:56.911
Did... did I... do something wrong?

56:57.378 --> 57:00.711
Yeah. You crept into my gut.

57:00.840 --> 57:04.837
You've got me thinking silly thoughts,
like... hanging up my gun for good.

57:04.969 --> 57:07.590
Becoming a one-woman guy.

57:07.721 --> 57:11.007
Settling down in
an ivy-covered cottage...

57:11.141 --> 57:13.264
...raking leaves out of the backyard...

57:13.394 --> 57:15.885
...squeezing orange juice
for you in the morning.

57:16.021 --> 57:18.144
You'd do that for me?

57:20.943 --> 57:23.315
- Yeah, I would.
- Oh, Rigby.

57:58.980 --> 58:01.222
Cody Jarrett's mother.

58:10.742 --> 58:12.651
Hello, Ma.

58:13.495 --> 58:16.246
My name is Reardon.
I have important news for you.

58:16.373 --> 58:18.661
So just pretend I'm your ma, OK?

58:18.792 --> 58:23.204
The paper said you were hit in the head
by a flying wrench in the machine shop.

58:23.338 --> 58:26.374
Friends of Carlotta are
after you because you know too much.

58:26.508 --> 58:30.042
- I see what you mean.
- So the flying wrench was no accident.

58:30.178 --> 58:32.087
For a minute I thought it was.

58:32.222 --> 58:35.175
Something like that
may happen again, so...

58:36.017 --> 58:38.508
The guard looks suspicious.
Act like I'm your ma.

58:38.645 --> 58:41.729
- Sure.
- Pretend I'm crying. You comfort me.

58:45.860 --> 58:47.485
Relax, Ma.

58:50.156 --> 58:53.441
Say something like, uh,
"No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me."

58:53.576 --> 58:56.328
No, no, Ma. Look, listen to me.

58:57.538 --> 59:00.076
That was good. Real good.

59:00.791 --> 59:03.627
Look, as long as the other
prisoners can get to you...

59:03.753 --> 59:06.457
...you're not safe.
But don't worry, I have a plan.

59:06.589 --> 59:09.127
<i>I contacted Warden Dudley,
who owed me a favour.</i>

59:09.258 --> 59:13.386
<i>I asked him to let me pose as a prisoner
so I could keep an eye on Jarrett...</i>

59:13.512 --> 59:15.719
<i>... maybe learn something about Carlotta.</i>

59:15.848 --> 59:19.549
<i>I learned fast. Jarrett had
a prison break planned that very night.</i>

59:19.685 --> 59:24.264
<i>I was invited along... at gunpoint.
When they stuffed me in the trunk...</i>

59:24.398 --> 59:28.147
<i>... I realised he was a friend
of Carlotta, and I was their enemy.</i>

59:29.236 --> 59:32.736
Ryley, you get in the front.
And you, you drive.

59:34.074 --> 59:36.648
<i>I bounced along in that trunk
a long time.</i>

59:36.785 --> 59:42.028
<i>Five hours later, I had given up hope of
ever going to a regular bathroom again.</i>

59:42.499 --> 59:45.370
<i>I decided to have a little chat
with Captain Jarrett.</i>

59:45.502 --> 59:47.958
Hey, Cody!

59:53.260 --> 59:55.929
- How ya doin', partner?
- I can't breathe.

59:56.054 --> 59:58.094
Oh. Stuffy, huh?

59:58.265 --> 01:00:00.720
- I'll give you a little air.
- Thanks.

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:13.526
<i>Her lips were warm, and my arm wasn't
the only thing that was throbbing.</i>

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:15.980
<i>Our hearts were, too.</i>

01:00:16.116 --> 01:00:19.449
<i>My plan was to kiss her
with every lip on my face...</i>

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.533
<i>... then slowly move her to the next room,
manoeuvre her next to the bed...</i>

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:28.293
<i>... marry her, and start
the whoopee machine.</i>

01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:31.252
<i>My plan was working fine until...</i>

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:34.465
Agh! You stuck your finger
in my bullet hole.

01:00:34.593 --> 01:00:37.048
- Sorry, Rigby.
- I'll be all right.

01:00:39.055 --> 01:00:41.048
Why don't you lie down?

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:45.097
I'll go to the drugstore
and get you something for your arm.

01:00:46.855 --> 01:00:49.524
It's raining too hard.
Call a cab. Hurry back.

01:00:49.649 --> 01:00:51.938
I feel like kissing somebody.

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:54.476
Don't start without me.

01:01:03.121 --> 01:01:04.912
Hello?

01:01:05.039 --> 01:01:06.699
<i>- It's me, Margaret.</i>
- Who?

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.624
<i>- Margaret.</i>
- Margaret?

01:01:08.751 --> 01:01:11.325
<i>Margaret Croyden.</i>

01:01:11.462 --> 01:01:14.380
Margaret Croyden? I don't believe it!

01:01:15.466 --> 01:01:18.503
- I don't believe you'd call me.
- I'd have called sooner...

01:01:18.636 --> 01:01:21.092
- You shouldn't call at all.
- It's so quiet here.

01:01:21.222 --> 01:01:24.176
Oh, Victor's gone
for the weekend, huh?

01:01:24.308 --> 01:01:26.716
Sorry. Not interested.

01:01:28.854 --> 01:01:32.722
Because I'm in love. Yeah, really in love.

01:01:35.653 --> 01:01:39.733
A few days ago I said something
to a woman I thought I'd never say.

01:01:40.116 --> 01:01:44.363
I actually said "I want to settle down
in an ivy-covered cottage with you...

01:01:44.495 --> 01:01:46.986
<i>... rake leaves out of the backyard...</i>

01:01:47.123 --> 01:01:50.326
<i>... squeeze orange juice
for you in the morning. "</i>

01:01:50.459 --> 01:01:53.579
<i> I spoke to Victor.
He'll give me the divorce.</i>

01:01:53.712 --> 01:01:57.247
<i>I'll tell you what. Come down
tomorrow. We'll drive back together.</i>

01:01:57.383 --> 01:02:02.377
<i> Wonderful! I can't wait to
come bouncing back into your life again.</i>

01:02:06.016 --> 01:02:08.638
No dice, Margaret.
Call me in another 12 years.

01:02:08.769 --> 01:02:11.011
All right, darling.

01:02:47.474 --> 01:02:49.466
- Hello?
<i>- Mr Reardon...</i>

01:02:49.601 --> 01:02:52.555
<i>... I have decided to close this case
as of this moment.</i>

01:02:52.687 --> 01:02:56.056
A cheque will be in the mail
for you tomorrow.

01:02:56.191 --> 01:02:59.939
Please do not try to contact me
as I will be out of town for some time.

01:03:00.445 --> 01:03:03.316
Juliet, has someone
got a gun to your head?

01:03:04.157 --> 01:03:05.616
Juliet!

01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:11.988
<i>A half-bottle of bourbon later
I still couldn't believe it.</i>

01:03:12.123 --> 01:03:14.330
<i>Was Juliet crazy like her sister?</i>

01:03:14.459 --> 01:03:18.872
<i>Had she fallen in love with the cab
driver on the way to the drugstore?</i>

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:23.085
<i>Or was she a member of the Carlotta
conspiracy and had set me up?</i>

01:03:23.218 --> 01:03:26.586
<i>Finally, I arrived at
a very important conclusion.</i>

01:03:27.263 --> 01:03:29.505
Shit on her!

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:44.859
All dames are alike.

01:03:46.407 --> 01:03:49.906
They reach down your throat,
grab your heart... and pull it out.

01:03:50.036 --> 01:03:54.698
They throw it on the floor... and
they step on it with their high heels.

01:03:55.374 --> 01:03:59.502
They spit on it, shove it in the oven,
then cook the shit out of it.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:04.255
They slice it into little pieces,
slam it on a hunk of toast...

01:04:04.383 --> 01:04:06.839
...and they serve it to ya.

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:10.670
They expect you to say
"Thanks, honey, it's delicious."

01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:16.762
Well, it's not delicious, Juliet Forrest.

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:19.137
It's rotten.

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:22.222
I don't give a damn
if I ever hear from you again.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.150
- Juliet?
- This is Alan.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:32.407
Alan?

01:04:33.078 --> 01:04:36.993
- Come on, Marlowe, no games.
- I never could fool you, could I?

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:40.493
No.

01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:42.537
Listen, Marlowe.

01:04:42.963 --> 01:04:45.335
Juliet left me, and...

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:49.260
...I feel like I've been hit
with a wet frying pan.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.462
How the hell do you pick up the pieces?

01:04:51.597 --> 01:04:55.546
I'm beginning to realise it's better
to have something to look forward to.

01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:58.638
"Look forward to." Like what? Work?

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.680
I can't get a break on this case.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.435
I don't even know who the hell
this Carlotta dame is.

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:06.022
<i>Can you get a map of South America?</i>

01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:08.726
- Yeah. You got something?
- Look up Peru.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.025
Got it!

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:17.031
There's a little town
on the coast called Paita.

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:19.571
<i>Tell me where it is.</i>

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:24.752
It's right next to
a tiny little island called...

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:28.083
You son of a gun! Carlotta!

01:05:29.217 --> 01:05:31.589
Damn! It's not a woman's name.

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.920
It's a place.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.678
- Thanks, Marlowe. I owe ya.
- Good.

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:40.810
I'm leaving for Carlotta right now.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:44.271
Even if Juliet's gone,
I'm gonna solve this case...

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:48.479
...no matter how many killers are
involved, even if Juliet's one of 'em.

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:51.281
Any idea where in Carlotta
I should start looking?

01:05:51.406 --> 01:05:54.027
<i>There's a little café right on the bay.</i>

01:05:55.410 --> 01:06:00.535
<i>When I arrived, I thought of the words
Marlowe had said to me 15 years ago:</i>

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.866
<i>"Dead men don't wear plaid."</i>

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.704
<i>Dead men don't wear plaid.</i>

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:12.670
<i>I still don't know what it means.</i>

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:17.841
<i>Carlotta was the kind of town where
they spell trouble t-r-u-b-i-l...</i>

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:21.259
<i>... and if you try to
correct them, they kill you.</i>

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:38.276
<i>I knew Marlowe had steered me right.</i>

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:42.242
<i>There was Kitty Collins, the girl
who ditched me in Santa Barbara.</i>

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.867
Señor Reardon.

01:06:52.132 --> 01:06:54.374
Manuel Alesandro.

01:06:57.805 --> 01:06:59.714
Not quite.

01:06:59.848 --> 01:07:01.806
Carlos Rodriguez.

01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:06.137
- Carlos Rodriguez?
<i>- Sí.</i>

01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:10.899
Before the war...
we ran guns to the rebels.

01:07:12.569 --> 01:07:14.396
Oh, yeah.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:16.939
You're a cop.

01:07:17.074 --> 01:07:18.983
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

01:07:19.117 --> 01:07:21.443
I have joined the establishment.

01:07:22.955 --> 01:07:27.866
That's good, Carlos. I'm here on an
investigation. Maybe you can help me.

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:30.539
There is much to investigate in Carlotta.

01:07:31.338 --> 01:07:34.043
The whole island is like a powder keg.

01:07:34.174 --> 01:07:38.385
There is much tension, the...
the smell of something rotten.

01:07:39.596 --> 01:07:43.510
That's what I'm here for.
To find out what it is that smells.

01:07:43.642 --> 01:07:45.219
Psst!

01:07:45.352 --> 01:07:49.729
Be careful of the, uh,
fat one who sweats a lot.

01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:53.651
What about Kitty Collins?

01:07:53.777 --> 01:07:57.110
She doesn't sweat as much,
but she's just as dangerous.

01:07:57.238 --> 01:07:59.611
# What you want

01:07:59.741 --> 01:08:01.780
# Everybody wants

01:08:06.122 --> 01:08:08.578
They say she is one of them.

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:11.783
Who is..."them"?

01:08:12.462 --> 01:08:15.961
Nobody knows.
Only they know who is "them".

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:20.590
But there is a man.
His name is <i>Arroz.</i> Rice.

01:08:22.263 --> 01:08:24.754
Kitty Collins is in love with him.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:27.841
He is a killer.

01:08:27.977 --> 01:08:30.265
Rice, huh?

01:08:31.064 --> 01:08:33.555
- Thanks, Carlos.
<i>- De nada, señor.</i>

01:08:35.693 --> 01:08:38.729
- Where are you staying?
- Hotel Guano.

01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:41.698
Ha! I'll be in touch.

01:08:41.823 --> 01:08:44.279
<i>Cuidado, Señor Reardon.</i>

01:08:44.410 --> 01:08:47.993
<i>Cuidado,</i> Carlos... <i>Cuidado.</i>

01:08:48.122 --> 01:08:51.573
<i>I wanted Kitty Collins
to tell "them" I was in town...</i>

01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:55.042
<i>... so I tossed a five-pesetaria coin
into the bowl.</i>

01:08:55.296 --> 01:08:58.296
<i>The clank was loud enough
to make her look my way.</i>

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:02.796
<i>That five-pesetaria coin was
the best investment I ever made.</i>

01:09:02.928 --> 01:09:08.089
<i>The next day, I hooked a big fish:
A fat one who sweats a lot.</i>

01:09:10.603 --> 01:09:14.350
<i>- Señor?</i>
- Nothing alcoholic. Oh, a beer, maybe.

01:09:14.814 --> 01:09:16.475
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

01:09:17.359 --> 01:09:19.814
Hard liquor goes to my feet.

01:09:22.488 --> 01:09:25.573
Just a minute, Mr Rigby.

01:09:26.452 --> 01:09:28.990
We know who you are, Mr Rigby.

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:31.078
I'm interested. Who am I?

01:09:31.206 --> 01:09:34.492
You could be a guy
who collects $10,000...

01:09:35.169 --> 01:09:37.327
...just to leave this stinkin' town.

01:09:37.462 --> 01:09:40.131
- I could, could I?
- You know who I could be?

01:09:42.176 --> 01:09:44.381
Hunchback of Notre Dame?

01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:49.006
I could be the guy
who hands ya... them $10,000.

01:09:49.933 --> 01:09:53.551
$10,000. Me to you... just like that.

01:09:53.687 --> 01:09:57.934
Sorry. My price for leaving
stinking towns is 11,500...

01:09:58.066 --> 01:10:00.853
...and a kiss on the lips
from Carmen Miranda.

01:10:00.986 --> 01:10:04.853
Pass it on to "them". Room 204.

01:10:06.074 --> 01:10:07.782
Room 204, señora.

01:10:17.919 --> 01:10:19.746
Come in.

01:10:21.589 --> 01:10:24.590
Right on time, Kitty. Been expecting ya.

01:10:24.718 --> 01:10:26.959
Thought you'd come last night.

01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:30.215
- I wasn't thinking too well last night.
- Keep talking.

01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:33.183
You see, I just
found out something, Rigby.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:38.058
Who you are, what you do,
and why you're in Carlotta.

01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:40.645
I'm here to bust up your game.

01:10:43.695 --> 01:10:48.522
I don't get it. A class girl like you
in love with a killer like Rice.

01:10:48.658 --> 01:10:51.279
Who... what... why?

01:10:51.411 --> 01:10:53.450
When you love someone...

01:10:53.579 --> 01:10:57.826
...I guess it doesn't make
any difference who, what or why.

01:10:57.959 --> 01:11:00.414
You go right on loving them.

01:11:02.547 --> 01:11:04.788
Yeah, you do, don't ya?

01:11:05.675 --> 01:11:08.130
I feel as if...

01:11:12.723 --> 01:11:15.594
Make me another drink, will you, baby?

01:11:20.314 --> 01:11:22.271
Hello?

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.891
- What's up, <i>amigo?</i>
- Plenty.

01:11:25.569 --> 01:11:28.903
A plane arrived today, and
all the passengers spoke German.

01:11:29.031 --> 01:11:32.482
- German?
<i>- Mm-hm. Our friend Rice was there.</i>

01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:35.702
They gave him a packet.
It was marked today's date...

01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:38.367
...and "Final Instructions".
- How do you know?

01:11:38.499 --> 01:11:43.410
I was hired to protect Rice until he
gets on that plane with Kitty Collins...

01:11:43.546 --> 01:11:46.119
<i>... tonight after the Carlotta Festival.</i>

01:11:47.174 --> 01:11:49.001
Why are you telling <i>me</i> this?

01:11:49.134 --> 01:11:52.088
Because the lives of
millions of innocent p...

01:11:52.221 --> 01:11:54.593
Carlos? Carlos!

01:11:55.724 --> 01:11:57.764
Carlos!

01:11:57.893 --> 01:11:59.933
Damn.

01:12:06.944 --> 01:12:09.351
Where are you and Rice headed tonight?

01:12:09.738 --> 01:12:12.609
What do you know about
a plane with Germermans on it?

01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:14.781
Germerm... Germans.

01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:17.700
Germermans.

01:12:18.664 --> 01:12:22.033
There's a plane with mermans on it.

01:12:23.877 --> 01:12:26.202
The plane's in town.

01:12:27.506 --> 01:12:29.747
Ethel Merman came in on it.

01:12:35.806 --> 01:12:38.343
Wanna go see Ethel Merman with me?

01:12:39.893 --> 01:12:42.135
I'll buy two tickets.

01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:45.604
Let me get on my pyjamas,
I'll be ready to go.

01:12:47.317 --> 01:12:49.475
<i>I'd done some brilliant things
in my time.</i>

01:12:49.611 --> 01:12:53.525
<i>Asking Kitty Collins to mix me
a drink wasn't one of them.</i>

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.280
<i>When I came to, I could make out
only light and shadow at first.</i>

01:12:59.412 --> 01:13:02.698
<i>Then I saw an unfamiliar face.
But even in my stupor...</i>

01:13:02.832 --> 01:13:06.996
<i>... I knew he was one of the big fish
in the conspiracy: Rice!</i>

01:13:07.128 --> 01:13:09.417
Well, I believe
that about winds things up.

01:13:09.923 --> 01:13:13.588
- I'm gonna wind <i>you</i> up on a rope.
- But you're the one who's gonna die.

01:13:13.718 --> 01:13:18.629
Better make it look good. If anything
fishy happens to me, the FBI...

01:13:18.765 --> 01:13:20.307
It'll look very natural.

01:13:20.433 --> 01:13:24.596
People who know Rigby Reardon
know I'd never die a natural death.

01:13:26.647 --> 01:13:28.854
Do you think
I'd leave you around to talk?!

01:13:28.983 --> 01:13:31.189
You've already talked too much!

01:13:38.451 --> 01:13:40.527
Hold it, Rice!

01:13:41.037 --> 01:13:44.406
You're not getting on that plane
tonight. I want those papers.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.624
I'm gonna walk out of this room.
You won't shoot.

01:13:47.752 --> 01:13:49.993
I won't?

01:13:51.005 --> 01:13:55.466
That was a warning shot, Rice. And I
don't fire as many of 'em as I used to.

01:14:08.898 --> 01:14:11.020
Rigby! <i>Señor!</i>

01:14:11.150 --> 01:14:13.189
- I heard shots.
- I'm all right.

01:14:13.319 --> 01:14:15.607
- Rice went that way.
- Come on, Carlos!

01:14:15.738 --> 01:14:19.570
Are you wearing pyjamas?
<i>Señor</i>, I'll help you take them off.

01:14:21.201 --> 01:14:23.906
I don't need help
with my pyjamas! Stop!

01:14:24.038 --> 01:14:25.911
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Carlos!

01:14:26.039 --> 01:14:30.500
<i>Sí.</i> Don't worry about your pyjamas,
<i>señor.</i> I'll take care of them.

01:14:30.627 --> 01:14:33.794
Out of the way!
We are chasing a killer!

01:14:33.922 --> 01:14:36.378
Everybody stand back! He's with me.

01:14:38.427 --> 01:14:40.550
Coming through!

01:14:42.347 --> 01:14:44.091
<i>Señor!</i>

01:14:44.224 --> 01:14:46.264
<i>Cuidado, señor. Cuidado!</i>

01:14:47.519 --> 01:14:50.188
- Stand back!
<i>- Cuidado!</i>

01:14:51.815 --> 01:14:53.973
<i>Señor!</i> Your pyjamas!

01:14:54.109 --> 01:14:56.682
Forget the pyjamas!

01:14:59.906 --> 01:15:01.982
- Are you all right?
- It's just a bullet.

01:15:02.117 --> 01:15:05.616
My wife Carmelita
will suck it out. Go ahead, <i>señor.</i>

01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:10.582
And don't worry about your pyjamas.
I'll take care of them!

01:15:58.798 --> 01:16:01.040
"Final Instructions".

01:16:07.265 --> 01:16:09.886
So that's their game.

01:16:18.859 --> 01:16:21.101
"Rasmussen Place".

01:16:41.882 --> 01:16:46.129
<i>The last thing I expected to see
was Juliet and her father, alive...</i>

01:16:46.261 --> 01:16:50.259
<i>... talking with their butler,
who was dressed in a Nazi uniform.</i>

01:16:50.391 --> 01:16:52.928
<i>Yeah. That explained a lot.</i>

01:16:53.060 --> 01:16:56.476
<i>Why Juliet was able
to translate German, for one thing.</i>

01:16:56.605 --> 01:16:58.894
<i>I'd been played for a sucker.</i>

01:16:59.024 --> 01:17:02.108
<i>But it wasn't too late
to set things straight.</i>

01:17:07.366 --> 01:17:09.239
Yaaah!

01:17:11.578 --> 01:17:14.449
OK, hands in the air.
Over on the steps. Let's go!

01:17:14.581 --> 01:17:18.413
It's time for a class picture.
Tall ones in back, short ones in front.

01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:21.166
Now sit! Hold hands.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.622
Now smile.

01:17:25.092 --> 01:17:26.502
- That's nice.
- Rigby...

01:17:26.635 --> 01:17:29.920
Hold it! Stay where you are,
you dirty, lying Nazi scum.

01:17:30.055 --> 01:17:31.335
Rigby!

01:17:31.473 --> 01:17:34.723
I should have known. I fell for
a dame who played me for a sucker.

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:37.389
No, Mr Reardon. She did not
play you for a sucker.

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:43.475
<i>I did. Pretending to be a butler, waiting
on inferior races was galling to me.</i>

01:17:43.610 --> 01:17:47.654
- But I fooled everyone.
- You see, Rigby? I didn't betray you.

01:17:47.781 --> 01:17:50.817
- How did you know to come here?
- Marlowe told me.

01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:54.035
That's how I found Daddy.
I smelled his cheese moulds.

01:17:54.162 --> 01:17:56.534
I am sorry to interrupt
such a tender scene...

01:17:56.664 --> 01:17:59.120
...but we have a plan to carry out now.

01:17:59.501 --> 01:18:03.581
- Who are you really, kraut?
- Field Marshal Wilfred von Kluck.

01:18:03.713 --> 01:18:06.085
- At your service.
- Von Kluck?

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:09.133
Former chief of Hitler's
Special Secret Weapons Corps.

01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.798
I'm flattered. How did you know?

01:18:11.929 --> 01:18:14.385
I figured out
your whole stinking scheme.

01:18:14.515 --> 01:18:18.430
How you duped Dr Forrest into helping
you. How you flew in your agents!

01:18:18.561 --> 01:18:21.432
The finest officers in the Führer's army.

01:18:22.023 --> 01:18:25.558
- Former army.
- For the moment.

01:18:25.693 --> 01:18:27.602
But we shall rise again.

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:30.773
- We'll see about that.
- How did they use Daddy?

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:34.655
Bullet-head here found out your father
had developed a cheese mould...

01:18:34.785 --> 01:18:38.320
...so powerful it could decompose
rocks, trees and mountains.

01:18:38.456 --> 01:18:41.659
He devised a plan to dissolve
the entire United States.

01:18:41.792 --> 01:18:45.078
At first your father gave
this swine information because...

01:18:45.212 --> 01:18:48.877
Please, Mr Reardon.
Allow <i>me</i> to tell the story.

01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:51.583
- Your father went along...
- Mr Reardon.

01:18:51.719 --> 01:18:56.215
It is customary in these situations for
the developer of the plan to describe it.

01:18:56.348 --> 01:19:01.425
I beg your pardon. It's customary for the
private eye to tell how he figured it out.

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:03.389
No, it is my right!

01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:07.306
We were able to dupe Dr Forrest by
posing as a humanitarian organisation...

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:10.693
...who planned to wipe out hunger
by ageing cheese faster.

01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:14.949
- When he saw what they were doing...
- He assembled lists of our agents...

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:19.903
- And seemed about to go to the FBI...
- We had to drug him and bring him...

01:19:20.038 --> 01:19:23.123
Here, faking his death
so there'd be no investigation...

01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:26.286
But while testing the mould
on a small island nearby...

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:30.464
The <i>Immer Essen</i> passed by. Some of
the passengers saw the island dissolve...

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:33.260
They were therefore labelled "enemies".

01:19:33.385 --> 01:19:35.841
We had Neff cancel
all further tours, and our...

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:40.182
...friends systematically began to
eliminate everyone on that cruise ship!

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:42.764
<i>- Schweinehund!</i>
- Jerk!

01:19:45.397 --> 01:19:47.140
Now...

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:51.186
...we are ready.
Our agents have just returned...

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:54.237
...after planting cheese bombs
throughout America.

01:19:54.364 --> 01:19:57.815
With America destroyed,
we will win the next war.

01:19:57.951 --> 01:19:59.659
And the one after that, too!

01:19:59.786 --> 01:20:04.115
When these switches are thrown, your
meddling country will disintegrate...

01:20:04.249 --> 01:20:06.241
...like a mouldy hunk of Liederkranz!

01:20:06.376 --> 01:20:09.661
Hold the mould, Kluck. Those switches
aren't going to be thrown.

01:20:09.796 --> 01:20:13.580
<i>Und</i> I think they will be.

01:20:13.717 --> 01:20:15.756
<i>Halt ihn!</i>

01:20:19.139 --> 01:20:22.139
Good... good.

01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:27.184
I'm sorry to prevent
your becoming a hero, Herr Reardon.

01:20:27.313 --> 01:20:30.765
Actually, it is too bad
you and I are on opposite sides.

01:20:31.067 --> 01:20:34.602
I admire your tenacity.
Under different circumstances...

01:20:34.737 --> 01:20:40.194
...I might have even allowed you to live,
perhaps as my, uh... valet, or butler.

01:20:41.327 --> 01:20:44.613
And what would you have me
become, Herr Field Marshal?

01:20:44.747 --> 01:20:46.539
- What?
- I said...

01:20:46.666 --> 01:20:50.829
...what position could I hold
in your "New Order"?

01:20:50.962 --> 01:20:54.165
Juliet! What are you saying?
He's a Nazi! Don't beg a Nazi!

01:20:54.298 --> 01:20:56.872
Would I be your... <i>Reinemachefrau?</i>

01:20:57.009 --> 01:21:00.176
<i>Ja, you could, uh... you could be that.</i>

01:21:00.304 --> 01:21:03.222
- What is that? What is it?!
- Tell him.

01:21:03.349 --> 01:21:06.219
<i>- Reinemachefrau.
- Rrrreinemachefrau.</i>

01:21:07.937 --> 01:21:12.433
It means she could be
my... cleaning woman.

01:21:12.817 --> 01:21:15.023
Cleaning woman!

01:21:25.079 --> 01:21:27.321
All right, join your pals.
Let's go! Move it!

01:21:27.456 --> 01:21:30.825
Great work, Juliet.
Go find Carlos Rodriguez for me.

01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:32.288
All right.

01:21:32.419 --> 01:21:35.456
Your having that gun
won't stop us, Herr Reardon.

01:21:35.589 --> 01:21:39.207
We are a dedicated people,
willing to sacrifice ourselves!

01:21:39.343 --> 01:21:43.127
There are only six bullets
in that gun. There are nine of us.

01:21:43.263 --> 01:21:47.095
Thus at least three will survive
to throw those switches.

01:21:47.226 --> 01:21:50.227
OK. But who's going to win the lottery...

01:21:50.354 --> 01:21:52.927
...and who's going to lose?

01:21:55.192 --> 01:21:58.525
Cowards! Fools!

01:21:59.363 --> 01:22:01.402
I'll do it myself!

01:22:01.531 --> 01:22:03.191
Sorry, pal. You're through.

01:22:09.331 --> 01:22:12.000
Not... quite.

01:22:16.338 --> 01:22:18.377
At least... we got...

01:22:19.049 --> 01:22:23.260
...Terre Haute, India... na.

01:22:24.513 --> 01:22:27.798
Damn! They were just about
to get a public library.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.676
Carlos, lock these creeps up.

01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:32.720
With pleasure!

01:22:32.854 --> 01:22:36.188
OK, creeps. <i>Vámonos!</i> Let's go!

01:22:37.108 --> 01:22:39.267
<i>Schweinehunds!</i> Pig dogs!

01:22:39.736 --> 01:22:43.864
I pity the Devil the day
you boys start arriving in bunches.

01:22:47.494 --> 01:22:50.697
<i>Señor</i> Reardon, when will
you be leaving Carlotta?

01:22:51.581 --> 01:22:53.620
- Next plane out, Carlos.
- Aha!

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:57.450
That gives me four hours
to wash and press your pyjamas.

01:22:58.087 --> 01:23:00.127
No, thanks, Carlos.

01:23:00.798 --> 01:23:03.468
I don't think I'll be
needing my pyjamas any more.

01:23:09.599 --> 01:23:11.841
What a guy!

01:23:25.114 --> 01:23:26.941
What are you... doing?

01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:28.984
Adjusting your willie.

01:23:29.118 --> 01:23:33.163
When you fell through the window,
it shifted out of whack.

01:23:33.289 --> 01:23:35.614
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:23:37.209 --> 01:23:40.910
<i>I hadn't had my willie
adjusted like that in a long time...</i>

01:23:41.589 --> 01:23:44.210
<i>... especially without having to beg.</i>

01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:47.666
<i>So there it was - the Carlotta mystery...</i>

01:23:47.803 --> 01:23:50.508
<i>... all wrapped up in a neat little bundle.</i>

01:23:50.973 --> 01:23:54.971
<i>As I stood there kissing Juliet, I thought
of nothing but hanging up my gun...</i>

01:23:55.102 --> 01:23:58.934
<i>... and spending the rest of my days
in that ivy-covered cottage.</i>

01:23:59.064 --> 01:24:02.065
<i>Little did I realise
that less than a year later...</i>

01:24:02.192 --> 01:24:05.277
<i>... she and I would have
an even more exciting adventure...</i>

01:24:05.404 --> 01:24:08.607
<i>... which is coming soon
to your neighbourhood theatre...</i>

01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:11.410
<i>... with a possible nude scene by Juliet.</i>
