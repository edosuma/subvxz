00:18.906 --> 00:20.806
It's alive!

00:39.193 --> 00:41.627
I know have not always
been the best husband.

00:41.695 --> 00:43.959
That's the smartest thing to
ever come out of your mouth.

00:44.031 --> 00:45.623
You want to know
another smartest thing

00:45.699 --> 00:47.132
to ever come
out of your mouth?

00:47.201 --> 00:48.532
Mein doodle!

00:48.602 --> 00:50.695
I'm Einstein, bitch!

00:50.771 --> 00:52.898
Einstein, motherfucker!

00:53.941 --> 00:55.135
Hey, did you hear
what I said

00:55.209 --> 00:56.733
to that bartender
last night?

00:56.810 --> 01:00.371
I said, "I'm calling the cops.
You just served a miner!"

01:00.447 --> 01:02.540
Oh, ho ho!
Another zinger.

01:02.616 --> 01:05.449
You know, sometimes down here
I actually pray for a gas leak.

01:05.519 --> 01:06.884
Uh-oh!

01:06.954 --> 01:08.046
Watch out!

01:09.857 --> 01:11.449
Oh, no,
we're trapped.

01:11.525 --> 01:13.925
And worst of all,
I really do smell gas.

01:13.994 --> 01:16.224
That could be
my IBS acting up.

01:16.297 --> 01:18.322
Just to be safe, let's put on
our protective anti-gas suits

01:18.399 --> 01:19.991
and let's look
for another way out.

01:21.735 --> 01:24.465
Wait, what's that?

01:24.538 --> 01:26.165
What in the sweet hell?

01:26.240 --> 01:28.708
Holy crap! Run!

01:31.545 --> 01:35.106
It's gaining on us!
We're not gonna make it!

01:35.182 --> 01:36.149
I'll stop him.

01:36.217 --> 01:37.650
You got a family
to think of.

01:37.718 --> 01:39.652
What?
You're married, Bill!

01:39.720 --> 01:42.348
Yeah, but I've always
loved you, Harvey.

01:45.226 --> 01:46.420
What the...

01:46.493 --> 01:48.825
Oh! Oh, Bill!

01:55.736 --> 01:57.328
Dad, wait up!

01:57.404 --> 01:59.429
I want you to have
my bicycle pump

01:59.506 --> 02:01.371
because I... I love you.

02:01.442 --> 02:05.173
Oh, only one chance.

02:05.246 --> 02:08.181
Inflate death,
you monster!

02:11.151 --> 02:15.349
I... I loved you, too, Bill!

02:27.368 --> 02:29.131
I don't wanna go to sleep.
You can't make me.

02:29.203 --> 02:30.966
I'm sorry, honey,
but it's bedtime.

02:31.038 --> 02:32.471
I hate you.

02:32.539 --> 02:34.131
And dolly hates you, too.

02:34.208 --> 02:36.506
Well, you're my daughter
and I love you,

02:36.577 --> 02:38.101
but that bitch
is gonna pay.

02:38.178 --> 02:39.907
Hate me, dolly?!

02:39.980 --> 02:41.948
Huh, dolly?!
You don't like me?!

02:43.717 --> 02:46.379
Why, why, why?!

02:46.453 --> 02:49.354
You ungrateful,
stupid ragdoll!

02:50.991 --> 02:52.982
Stop!
You're killing her!

02:53.060 --> 02:55.995
Let that be a lesson
to the rest of you!

02:56.063 --> 02:58.258
Sleep well, baby.

03:01.035 --> 03:02.798
I'm Danny Ocean,
and for this caper

03:02.870 --> 03:06.135
we're gonna need more
than 11, 12, or 13 guys.

03:06.206 --> 03:08.674
So, team one...
Brad Pitt, Matt Damon,

03:08.742 --> 03:11.370
Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner,
Elliot Gould, Scott Caan,

03:11.445 --> 03:14.710
Shaobo Qin, Eddie Jameson,
Andy Garcia, Leonardo DiCaprio

03:14.782 --> 03:16.943
Bruce Willis, Vin Diesel,
William Shatner,

Samuel Jackson,

03:22.790 --> 03:24.155
Jackie Chan
and Weird Al Yankovic...

03:24.224 --> 03:25.452
you start a fight
at the bar.

03:25.526 --> 03:27.357
Then team two...
Sylvester Stallone,

03:27.428 --> 03:29.589
Erik Estrada,
David Letterman, Vince Vaughn,

03:29.663 --> 03:31.961

03:32.032 --> 03:33.693

03:33.767 --> 03:36.429
panda with a monocle,
Peter Pan, John Denver's corpse,

03:36.503 --> 03:38.630
a mime,
Chirlaxx, the devourer of worlds,

03:38.706 --> 03:40.799
and Ryan Seacrest...
you'll slip in the back.

03:40.874 --> 03:41.738
Any questions?

03:41.809 --> 03:42.639
No!

03:42.710 --> 03:44.109
Then let's do this.

03:46.847 --> 03:49.577
Mama, why does Grandma
walk so slow?

03:49.650 --> 03:52.448
Because Grandma's old, honey,
and her bones are very brittle.

03:52.519 --> 03:54.510
Mama, what's brittle?

03:54.588 --> 03:57.989
You know, you know,
like peanut brittle, dear.

03:58.058 --> 04:00.652
Mmm. Yummy!

04:00.728 --> 04:02.662
Oh, hi,
little Rosa.

04:02.730 --> 04:04.595
What are you doing?
Ow!

04:04.665 --> 04:06.462
Where's the peanut brittle?
I want the peanut brittle.

04:06.533 --> 04:08.262
Where is it?

04:08.335 --> 04:10.200
Give it to me!
I want it!

04:10.270 --> 04:12.636
Rosa, no!
Put Grandma's leg back!

04:19.346 --> 04:20.836
Yes!
Oh, yeah!

04:20.914 --> 04:23.712
Did you see me on TV?
I had the round of my life!

04:23.784 --> 04:25.445
Yes, it was great.

04:25.519 --> 04:27.453
Except for one
crucial element...

04:27.521 --> 04:29.318
you weren't wearing
your Nike hat.

04:29.390 --> 04:31.824
Oh, yeah, my caddy put it
in the wrong carry-on bag.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.416
I'm sorry about that.

04:33.494 --> 04:34.984
Ha ha, you're
not sorry yet.

04:35.062 --> 04:36.256
But you will be.

04:36.330 --> 04:37.297
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.594
Hold him down!
No, please!

04:39.666 --> 04:41.861
We own you, Tiger!

04:43.604 --> 04:45.572
Own you!
Own you!

04:48.509 --> 04:50.340
They own me.
They own me!

04:50.411 --> 04:51.742
What is it, honey?

04:51.812 --> 04:53.575
I've forsaken my roots.

04:53.647 --> 04:55.842
I've let the white man
own me, baby.

04:55.916 --> 04:57.611
Body and soul.

04:57.684 --> 04:59.481
I'm nothing but a piece
of property to them.

04:59.553 --> 05:01.145
So what?
Your endorsement deal

05:01.221 --> 05:02.882
is worth
$105 million,

05:02.956 --> 05:04.821
and you're married
to a blond hottie.

05:04.892 --> 05:06.291
And anyway, aren't you
mostly Chinese?

05:06.360 --> 05:08.328
Oh, yeah.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.193
Oh, yeah, you're
in the sandtrap, baby.

05:11.265 --> 05:13.324
Hole in one, whoo!

05:15.269 --> 05:17.635
Hello, ma'am, did you call
about an intruder in your house?

05:17.704 --> 05:21.162
Uh, no.

05:21.241 --> 05:23.334
What's wrong
with your eyes, ma'am?

05:23.410 --> 05:25.469
Is that some sort
of a tick?

05:25.546 --> 05:27.605
Well, if there's no intruder,
I'll be on my way.

05:27.681 --> 05:29.945
I'd get that eye
checked out by a doctor.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.514
Ewww!

05:34.588 --> 05:37.455
He's got cooties!

05:39.126 --> 05:41.321
Well, yes.
Blah blah, with the budget.

05:43.564 --> 05:45.191
My god.

05:45.265 --> 05:46.857
Aaah!

05:46.934 --> 05:48.902
The carrier!
Where's the carrier?!

05:53.807 --> 05:55.570
Don't worry,
you'll be fine.

05:55.642 --> 05:56.836
Contagion!

05:56.910 --> 05:58.639
Aaah!

05:59.646 --> 06:02.274
It looks
like we got it.

06:02.349 --> 06:04.909
Aaah!

06:04.985 --> 06:05.974
We're too late!

06:13.594 --> 06:15.562
Dude, I got a surprise
for my date.

06:15.629 --> 06:18.097
I cut a hole out of
the bottom of my popcorn bucket.

06:18.165 --> 06:20.030
That bucket's empty, dude.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.089
Where's the popcorn?

06:21.168 --> 06:22.965
Popcorn?

06:23.036 --> 06:24.628
Hey, Diana,
wanna feel my penis?

06:24.705 --> 06:26.297
Eww, why'd you
cover it in butter?

06:26.373 --> 06:27.738
What do you mean, butter?

06:27.808 --> 06:29.400
Shut up guys,
the trailers are starting.

07:06.313 --> 07:07.405
Oh, that sucked.

07:07.481 --> 07:09.346
Geez, tell the whole
theater, why don't ya?

07:10.417 --> 07:12.749
America would
never be the same.

07:12.819 --> 07:17.017
How could it,
after this day?

07:32.306 --> 07:33.898
Hey, more popcorn, dude?

07:33.974 --> 07:35.566
Aw, thanks, man.
I was just getting...

07:35.642 --> 07:37.075
Aw, son of a bitch!

07:37.144 --> 07:38.771
You touched my junk.

07:40.147 --> 07:43.378
Yo, Nick, we gotta get
our steps together, dawg,

07:43.450 --> 07:45.384
or we're never gonna get
out of this life, man.

07:45.452 --> 07:48.250
Yo, I step
for one person... me.

07:48.322 --> 07:51.348
# Young black people
on a rhythm team... #

07:52.593 --> 07:54.493
Yo, I step for one person...

07:54.561 --> 07:56.153
I know. You!

07:56.229 --> 07:57.821
You're dying to step
for your friends,

07:57.898 --> 07:59.923
but you're afraid your friends
won't be there to step for you.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.366
Yo, man, step off!
You don't know me!

08:05.706 --> 08:06.764
Alright, homies.

08:06.840 --> 08:09.308
Look like we're gonna have
to do it without him. Okay?

08:09.376 --> 08:11.139
Yo, it's time
to step up...

08:11.211 --> 08:13.111
for my friends.

08:13.180 --> 08:15.546
# We dress like thugs
but we're keeping it clean #

08:15.616 --> 08:17.846
# Young black people
on a rhythm team #

08:17.918 --> 08:20.148
# We dress like thugs
but we're keeping it clean #

08:20.220 --> 08:23.155
# Young black people
on a rhythm team #

08:23.223 --> 08:26.215
Look, dude, now I put
a hole in my soda cup.

08:26.293 --> 08:28.056
Dude, seriously,
what the fuck!

08:28.128 --> 08:29.891
Oh, hey, can I have
some soda?

08:29.963 --> 08:31.487
Sure.

08:31.565 --> 08:32.462
Aah!

08:32.532 --> 08:34.363
Shhh!

08:34.433 --> 08:36.799
Hey, hey, hey,
a pic-a-nic basket.

08:36.870 --> 08:38.895
It's pronounced picnic, Yogi.
Picnic!

08:38.972 --> 08:41.736
Hey, my lunch.

08:41.808 --> 08:43.503
Oh, we gotta run, Yogi.

08:45.846 --> 08:47.211
You'll never catch him.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.145
He's smarter than
the average bear.

08:50.684 --> 08:52.413
Surprise.

08:54.588 --> 08:57.489
No, Yogi!

08:57.557 --> 08:59.548
Aaahh!

09:00.827 --> 09:02.522
Do you like my hair?
I got it cut today.

09:02.596 --> 09:06.225
Shh! I'm trying to watch
these trailers, y'all!

09:07.401 --> 09:11.599
I'm just playing.
You go, trailers!

09:12.939 --> 09:16.932
<i>Stanley Kubrick's
2001: A Space Odyssey</i>

09:17.010 --> 09:18.875
is one of the most respected
cinematic achievements

09:18.945 --> 09:20.640
of all time.

09:20.714 --> 09:23.274
For generations of audiences,

09:23.350 --> 09:28.811
it's also
really, really boring.

09:28.889 --> 09:30.652
But help is on the way.

09:30.724 --> 09:32.555
This summer, catch
a brand-new edition

09:32.626 --> 09:36.687
<i>of 2001, featuring
Playboy Cyber Girl Robin Bain.</i>

09:36.763 --> 09:39.095
It's full of stars!

09:39.166 --> 09:41.999
Wow!

09:42.069 --> 09:44.003
Yes, 148 minutes
is a long time

09:44.071 --> 09:45.732
to watch crap float around

09:45.806 --> 09:47.398
set to classical music.

09:47.474 --> 09:51.240
But not when Robin Bain is
motherfucking naked!

09:51.311 --> 09:54.041
Space swimming's the best!

09:54.114 --> 09:57.049
I'm gonna help.
I love computers!

09:57.117 --> 09:59.642
I always wanted to do this.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.020
I'm helping!

10:04.091 --> 10:08.323
# Daisy, Daisy,
give my your answer... #

10:08.395 --> 10:11.796
Naked cartwheel
Whoo hoo!

10:11.865 --> 10:13.457
And best of all...

10:13.533 --> 10:15.433
Hi, folks,
I'm Stanley Kubrick,

10:15.502 --> 10:17.470
and I approve of this idea.

10:20.540 --> 10:23.976
...with boobs!

10:24.044 --> 10:25.671
Genius!
Masterpiece!

10:25.746 --> 10:28.010
And now our
feature presentation

10:28.081 --> 10:30.811
<i>of Robot Chicken:
The Credits, The Movie.</i>

10:32.552 --> 10:34.986
It's gonna be
the best movie ever!

10:54.775 --> 10:56.208
Hold on,
I want to see the credits.
