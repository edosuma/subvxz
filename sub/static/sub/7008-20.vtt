WEBVTT

00:04.386 --> 00:06.922
Well, I'm ready for
the big hockey game.

00:06.990 --> 00:08.957
You can't wear that shirt.
It's all stained.

00:09.025 --> 00:14.228
Mom, these happen to be the soda stains
from the '97 Stanley Cup finals.

00:14.297 --> 00:16.631
That's the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen.

00:16.699 --> 00:19.735
With one possible exception.

00:19.835 --> 00:21.036
What are those?
Blood stains?

00:21.103 --> 00:22.603
Oh, yeah.

00:22.671 --> 00:26.141
Yeah, that's when Yzerman bounced
a puck off of Dad's chin.

00:27.043 --> 00:29.110
Twice.

00:29.178 --> 00:31.317
But if anybody deserves to get hit
tonight, it's gotta be Wilson.

00:31.347 --> 00:33.185
- It's his birthday. Remember that.
- That's right, yeah.

00:33.215 --> 00:37.319
Oh, no. I didn't get him anything.
I forgot all about it.

00:37.386 --> 00:38.892
Don't worry. We're taking
him to the hockey game.

00:38.922 --> 00:40.293
And I got him something.
A little jersey.

00:40.323 --> 00:42.624
Look at this. Not bad, eh?

00:42.691 --> 00:45.460
No, no, no, no.
It's too nice and clean.

00:45.528 --> 00:48.530
You're gonna have to
rub some nachos on it.

00:48.598 --> 00:50.966
Nachos aren't right. Mustard
would look good with this.

00:51.033 --> 00:53.568
And for Wilson,
maybe a Grey Poupon.

00:55.538 --> 00:56.642
All right, Dad.
I'm gonna go warm up the car.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.340
Hey, don't forget
the octopi, all right?

00:58.407 --> 01:00.108
What do you think I am?
An idiot?

01:00.175 --> 01:02.811
I thought they wouldn't let you
bring those in there anymore.

01:02.879 --> 01:05.279
The real fan always finds a way.

01:08.651 --> 01:10.786
- Bye.
- See you, Dad.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.520
Where are you going?

01:12.588 --> 01:14.523
Out with Jenny Curtis for pizza.

01:14.590 --> 01:16.991
I think I got a shot
at being her boyfriend.

01:17.059 --> 01:19.861
Jenny Curtis.
Is she in your film club?

01:19.929 --> 01:22.464
That really pretty one that's
president of the honor society?

01:22.531 --> 01:26.268
Yup. And she's actually thinking
about dating a guy like me.

01:26.335 --> 01:28.636
What does that mean?
"A guy like you."

01:28.704 --> 01:32.808
Well, you know, fairly smart,
average-looking, but kind of geeky.

01:35.411 --> 01:37.078
Your basic five.

01:37.146 --> 01:38.413
You are not a five!

01:38.481 --> 01:41.916
You're great-looking, funny,
smart, and you're a ten.

01:41.984 --> 01:43.584
Mom, I don't want to be a ten.

01:43.652 --> 01:45.753
Jenny thinks all tens
are pig-headed jerks.

01:45.821 --> 01:48.656
I'm better off being a five.

01:48.724 --> 01:50.959
So you're trying to be geeky,
but not too geeky?

01:51.026 --> 01:52.894
It's a fine line.

01:54.163 --> 01:55.430
Don't want to forget this.

01:55.498 --> 01:57.532
Hey, smell my finger.

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:51.888 --> 02:53.154
Oh, Tim, these are great seats.

02:53.222 --> 02:54.255
Thanks.

02:54.323 --> 02:56.024
What a wonderful
birthday present!

02:56.091 --> 02:58.693
Happy birthday, Wilson.
How old are you now?

02:58.761 --> 03:02.163
Counting all my lives,
12,342 years old.

03:03.532 --> 03:06.067
That doesn't include
the years I was frozen.

03:08.504 --> 03:10.838
Yeah, lucky me,
I sit behind a human giraffe.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.207
Brad, I'd be glad
to switch with you.

03:13.275 --> 03:14.943
Yeah, will you, please?

03:15.011 --> 03:17.016
All right, come on, hurry up. There's
gonna be a face-off, you guys.

03:17.046 --> 03:20.381
All right. Did you know that hockey
originated with the Iroquois Indians?

03:20.449 --> 03:23.785
Their original term for
the game was "hoghee."

03:23.853 --> 03:28.556
The Iroquois, huh? What did they
use for a puck? Buffalo chips?

03:28.624 --> 03:32.660
No. In the Iroquois version,
they used actual human skulls.

03:32.728 --> 03:34.496
- Really?
- No!

03:38.400 --> 03:40.335
You know, another interesting
fact about hockey...

03:40.403 --> 03:41.907
Did you realize the
first professional team

03:41.937 --> 03:44.806
was organized in Houghton,
Michigan, in 1903?

03:44.874 --> 03:46.875
Don't know.
Don't care.

03:56.151 --> 03:58.520
Time to meet my little friend!

04:02.024 --> 04:04.558
Hey, what idiot just threw this?

04:04.626 --> 04:07.896
It was an accident.
I'm so sorry.

04:07.963 --> 04:11.499
Oh, oh, it's okay. It's probably
my fault for having my head there.

04:12.534 --> 04:14.936
Thanks.

04:14.938 --> 04:17.505
Hey, hey, yo, yo, yo.
Game's this way.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.209
<i>Okay, Red Wings fans.</i>

04:22.277 --> 04:24.211
<i>That's the end of
the first period.</i>

04:24.279 --> 04:28.082
<i>So it's time for our very
special surprise giveaway.</i>

04:28.150 --> 04:29.684
All right!

04:29.719 --> 04:31.853
Well, you seem very
excited about this contest.

04:31.921 --> 04:35.023
Forget the contest.
It's time for the Zamboni.

04:37.459 --> 04:41.729
<i>And the winning seat is
section 12, row 8, seat 22.</i>

04:45.668 --> 04:46.934
Shoot.

04:47.002 --> 04:48.436
It's you.

04:50.505 --> 04:53.641
Holy Mother Hubbard, it is me!

04:53.708 --> 04:56.210
We got a winner here, everybody!

04:56.278 --> 04:58.183
Wait, wait a second.
Tim, this should be your prize.

04:58.213 --> 05:00.048
You bought the ticket.

05:00.115 --> 05:01.387
I bought the ticket for your birthday.
It's all yours.

05:01.417 --> 05:02.487
Well, it should be Brad's.
He gave me his seat.

05:02.517 --> 05:03.588
Dad, the man's got a point.

05:03.618 --> 05:05.653
No, whosever butt...

05:05.720 --> 05:08.089
Whosever butt is in the seat
wins the prize, period.

05:08.157 --> 05:10.558
Well, I've got an idea.
Let's go halvsies.

05:11.994 --> 05:14.162
Halvsies?

05:14.229 --> 05:19.334
Men don't go halvsies. Men
don't even say "halvsies."

05:20.569 --> 05:21.740
Would the winner
come with me, please?

05:21.770 --> 05:23.438
Right here.

05:23.506 --> 05:26.074
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me.

05:29.845 --> 05:31.613
Man, I can't believe this!

05:31.680 --> 05:33.915
Oh, be happy for him. You
wouldn't want the prize anyway.

05:33.983 --> 05:36.651
Last game they gave away
a year's supply of pudding.

05:37.486 --> 05:39.320
I like pudding.

05:39.387 --> 05:43.091
<i>This is the biggest giveaway in
the history of Joe Louis Arena.</i>

05:43.158 --> 05:44.692
He's up on the screen.
<i>Wilson Wilson,</i>

05:44.760 --> 05:47.261
<i>as the one millionth
visitor this season,</i>

05:47.329 --> 05:50.164
<i>Bay City Motors
would like to present</i>

05:50.232 --> 05:53.301
<i>you with this check for $10,000!</i>

06:04.413 --> 06:06.580
Ten thousand dollars.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.584
That's a lot of pudding.

06:14.056 --> 06:16.925
Hi. How'd it go
with Jenny?

06:18.193 --> 06:19.560
Terrible.

06:19.628 --> 06:21.730
Edward Meany was
at the pizza place.

06:21.797 --> 06:23.498
I think Jenny's
interested in him.

06:23.532 --> 06:24.565
How come?

06:24.633 --> 06:26.701
Well, he used to be
a good-looking ten.

06:26.768 --> 06:30.438
But now he got glasses
and started a ham radio club.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.409
He's a five. I'm dead.

06:37.113 --> 06:38.646
Hello, guys.
How was the game?

06:38.714 --> 06:41.782
Well, the Wings lost.
But Wilson won.

06:41.850 --> 06:44.018
The biggest fan giveaway ever.

06:44.086 --> 06:45.920
Ten thousand dollars.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.390
Wilson won $10,000?
That's unbelievable.

06:49.692 --> 06:52.060
No. You know what's unbelievable?
I paid for the ticket.

06:53.696 --> 06:56.831
Want to know what's more unbelievable,
is that I gave him my seat.

06:56.898 --> 06:59.233
He's just gonna
keep all that money?

06:59.301 --> 07:02.370
Yeah. Because Dad told him
that guys don't split stuff.

07:04.606 --> 07:06.974
It's when I thought
the prize was pudding!

07:08.244 --> 07:10.979
I enjoy pudding.

07:11.046 --> 07:13.281
Look, guys, you know
Wilson needs the money.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.317
He hasn't painted his house in years.
And he needs a new roof.

07:16.352 --> 07:19.287
And a new furnace.
Maybe a new hat.

07:19.354 --> 07:23.491
I bet he spends that money on
something stupid like books.

07:27.162 --> 07:28.929
Well, hi-ho, Taylors.

07:28.998 --> 07:34.436
Well, Tim, I walked into my house
and I had a huge epiphany.

07:34.503 --> 07:38.639
After all that cotton candy, it
was bound to catch up with you.

07:38.707 --> 07:42.343
No. I was looking
at all my gardening magazines

07:42.411 --> 07:45.980
and I came up with a great idea
of how to spend my excess wealth.

07:46.048 --> 07:48.315
Unless, of course, you've reconsidered.
You want to split?

07:48.384 --> 07:50.151
As a matter of fact, I... No.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.586
No.

07:51.653 --> 07:53.088
Happy birthday, Wilson.

07:53.188 --> 07:54.121
Oh, Jill.

07:54.189 --> 07:55.523
Make a wish.

07:55.590 --> 07:57.391
Oh, thank you.

07:57.459 --> 07:58.492
Yay!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.962
Oh, oh, oh, thank you.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.797
So what are you gonna
do with all this money?

08:02.865 --> 08:04.465
Well, I've decided,

08:07.736 --> 08:11.338
instead of buying my plants,
I'm gonna grow my own.

08:11.406 --> 08:12.840
You're gonna grow your own?

08:12.908 --> 08:15.209
Brad, you can't go
over there anymore.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.578
Oh, no, no, no. Not those
kind of plants. No.

08:17.646 --> 08:20.715
All my life I've dreamed
of building a greenhouse

08:20.783 --> 08:23.318
and now this money
puts me over the top.

08:23.385 --> 08:24.623
Greenhouse.
That's a great idea.

08:24.653 --> 08:25.653
That is a great idea.

08:25.721 --> 08:26.954
- You know why?
- Why?

08:27.022 --> 08:28.727
We're looking for a spring
project on <i>Tool Time.</i>

08:28.757 --> 08:30.692
We could help you
design it and build it.

08:30.759 --> 08:32.659
Tim, that would be fantastic!

08:32.727 --> 08:35.196
Wait. You're gonna spend all
that money on a greenhouse?

08:35.264 --> 08:37.431
Yes, indeedy. I can
grow anything I want.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.133
Can you grow pudding?

08:43.072 --> 08:45.240
Does everybody know
what time it is?

08:45.307 --> 08:46.474
<i>Tool Time!
Tool Time!</i>

08:46.542 --> 08:48.676
That's right! Binford
Tools is proud to present

08:48.744 --> 08:51.178
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

09:02.224 --> 09:04.196
Thank you, everybody. Thank you, Heidi.
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

09:04.226 --> 09:06.193
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

09:06.261 --> 09:10.765
And of course, you all know my
assistant, Al "The Bad Seed" Borland.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.434
Thank you. Well, today we're
talking about one of the greatest

09:13.502 --> 09:16.704
pleasures in my life,
horticulture.

09:16.772 --> 09:19.573
You know, that's legal
in Nevada, baby.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.977
I'm talking about gardening.

09:23.045 --> 09:25.045
I'm sure you are.

09:25.113 --> 09:26.551
Today we're gonna
show you how to put up

09:26.581 --> 09:28.349
a beautiful garden
greenhouse in your yard.

09:28.416 --> 09:29.988
And for that we have
a special guest today

09:30.018 --> 09:31.489
who's embarking on
just such a project.

09:31.519 --> 09:33.687
He's a good friend and neighbor
of mine, Wilson Wilson.

09:33.756 --> 09:35.757
Heidi, my neighbor, please.

09:36.859 --> 09:38.392
Hidey-ho, Tim.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.660
Well, let's get started.

09:39.728 --> 09:41.662
Now, the first step
in building a greenhouse

09:41.730 --> 09:44.198
is to determine site,
size and materials.

09:44.266 --> 09:45.833
The site will be
Wilson's backyard.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.669
What I've selected for him is
this pre-fab 7-by-8 unit, right?

09:48.737 --> 09:50.638
It's got redwood.
It's got fiberglass panels.

09:50.705 --> 09:52.306
And it'll fit snug
up against his house.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.675
Well, this is very nice, Tim.

09:53.742 --> 09:57.078
But I still prefer my original
idea of this Victorian style.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.979
Well, we already
went over that backstage.

09:59.048 --> 10:01.408
It's just not good for the site.
It's a little too frou-frou.

10:01.450 --> 10:03.150
Tim, it's so pretty.

10:03.218 --> 10:04.785
I rest my case.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.793
Well, it's more than
pretty. Look at this.

10:07.823 --> 10:11.358
It's all steel, real glass
windows, wooden frames.

10:11.427 --> 10:12.698
How big is that
gonna be, Wilson?

10:12.728 --> 10:14.028
32 by 20, Al.

10:14.096 --> 10:15.263
It's just too big.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.298
But, Tim, I'm gonna
need a lot of space.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.899
I'll be growing
plants and vegetables

10:18.967 --> 10:20.601
from all my travels
around the world.

10:20.669 --> 10:23.437
Chinese rhododendron,
Italian bellflowers.

10:23.505 --> 10:24.972
As nice as the design is,

10:25.040 --> 10:26.879
it would just take up
your entire backyard, Wilson.

10:26.909 --> 10:30.444
Yeah. But who needs a backyard when
you're swimming in Japanese gingkoes?

10:30.512 --> 10:32.347
How true!

10:32.414 --> 10:34.720
But your neighbor has to look
at this ugly thing though, huh?

10:34.750 --> 10:37.485
Maybe Wilson could plant
some decorative ivy.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.887
Mother's always
been partial to vines.

10:39.955 --> 10:43.691
That's because she
swings from them.

10:43.759 --> 10:46.098
Folks, whenever you take on a
construction project of this size,

10:46.128 --> 10:47.762
you want to consult
your neighbor.

10:47.829 --> 10:49.702
Yes. But Tim, you have never
consulted me at Christmas time

10:49.732 --> 10:53.167
when you put an entire
amusement park on your roof.

10:53.235 --> 10:57.906
Those Christmas decorations
that he speaks of are seasonal.

10:57.973 --> 11:00.307
This freakin' thing
is a nightmare!

11:01.276 --> 11:02.877
Have you lost your mind?

11:02.945 --> 11:05.413
Well, we'll find that out right
after these words from Binford.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.121
Wilson, you can't build
this in your backyard.

11:10.151 --> 11:12.253
There's codes. You gotta
get building permits.

11:12.288 --> 11:16.190
Actually, as long as he leaves a 5-foot
easement between your properties,

11:16.258 --> 11:18.459
getting a variance
should be okay.

11:20.062 --> 11:23.030
I work part-time
for the zoning commission.

11:23.098 --> 11:26.367
How would you like
to make that full-time?

11:26.434 --> 11:28.469
I can't let you build this
thing in your backyard.

11:28.536 --> 11:30.371
Tim, I do not
need your permission.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.339
And I don't like the attitude.

11:32.407 --> 11:34.346
And I don't think we need to hear about it.
We're back on the air, guys.

11:34.376 --> 11:36.343
Well, maybe you are.
But I am not.

11:36.411 --> 11:38.045
Hello and goodbye!

11:38.112 --> 11:40.948
You can't leave in the
middle of the show.

11:44.219 --> 11:47.254
Hey, welcome back, everybody.
Good to have you here.

11:47.322 --> 11:50.691
Our guest had to leave quite suddenly.
So right now...

11:52.461 --> 11:56.997
Al, why don't you tell us your
favorite part of gardening?

11:57.065 --> 12:00.901
Well, I'd have to say it's getting
down and dirty with my hoe.

12:15.618 --> 12:17.318
Mom, when's dinner?
I'm starving.

12:17.386 --> 12:18.986
Oh, it'll just be a few minutes.

12:19.054 --> 12:20.221
How's it going?

12:20.289 --> 12:21.556
Great.

12:21.623 --> 12:24.058
Edward got contact lenses
and a new haircut.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.027
He's really looking good now.

12:28.597 --> 12:31.231
Mark, is there something
we need to talk about?

12:31.299 --> 12:34.468
No! No.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.671
Edward's back to being a ten, so
Jenny doesn't like him anymore.

12:37.739 --> 12:40.241
And tomorrow night, she's
coming over to study with me.

12:40.309 --> 12:43.411
Maybe you should wear that
new cool shirt I got you.

12:43.478 --> 12:45.846
What, are you crazy?
That would make me a seven.

12:49.484 --> 12:51.085
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.

12:51.153 --> 12:53.854
I made my hamburger casserole
for dinner tonight.

12:53.922 --> 12:56.390
We got bigger
problems than that.

12:57.692 --> 12:59.393
Did you watch <i>Tool Time</i> today?

12:59.461 --> 13:01.029
Working on the thesis.

13:01.096 --> 13:03.163
Wilson wouldn't
go with our design.

13:03.231 --> 13:07.835
Instead, he wants to build some 32-foot
Victorian monstrosity in his yard.

13:07.903 --> 13:10.704
I swear the guy's gone
construction-crazy.

13:10.772 --> 13:15.109
It's funny how you recognize
the symptoms in others.

13:15.176 --> 13:17.445
You know, I don't think you'll
find it all that humorous

13:17.512 --> 13:21.949
when our yard is invaded by Italian
Harvey Wallbangers and Japanese Pinkos.

13:23.452 --> 13:25.720
So now you're worried
about what he's planting?

13:25.787 --> 13:30.090
Not just that. What about the riffraff
that a big greenhouse is gonna attract?

13:30.158 --> 13:31.859
What riffraff?

13:31.927 --> 13:33.527
Botanist. Hello!

13:35.930 --> 13:37.331
If you're so worried about this,

13:37.399 --> 13:39.037
why don't you just go
outside and talk to Wilson?

13:39.067 --> 13:42.936
I tried to talk to him at work
and he just ran off the set.

13:43.004 --> 13:46.040
Well, you know,
it's Wilson's property.

13:46.107 --> 13:48.008
Ultimately, if he wants
to build this thing,

13:48.076 --> 13:49.515
I don't think there's
much you can do about it.

13:49.545 --> 13:51.212
Oh, really?

13:51.280 --> 13:53.960
I tell you one thing, when I jumpstart
this brain, I can do anything.

13:56.051 --> 13:58.953
So 100 years from now,
Wilson's got trouble.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.559
I'm really glad you
decided to study with me.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.362
I love history.
Why don't you quiz me?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.931
Okay. Who won
the Battle of the Bulge?

14:11.533 --> 14:13.467
Oprah.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.836
The Allies defeated
the Germans in Belgium.

14:15.904 --> 14:18.072
You're right.
You're very smart.

14:18.874 --> 14:21.209
Well, I'm not that smart.

14:21.276 --> 14:25.012
Well, you know, on a scale of
one to ten, I'm about a five.

14:26.281 --> 14:28.015
I love a five.

14:28.884 --> 14:30.584
Is it hot in here?

14:32.087 --> 14:33.287
Did you want to take a break?

14:33.355 --> 14:34.688
Go sit outside?

14:35.690 --> 14:37.291
It's cold out here.

14:37.359 --> 14:39.059
You want to go back inside?

14:39.127 --> 14:40.428
No. I'm okay.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.998
I wonder how they kept
warm during World War II?

14:47.869 --> 14:50.838
You know, interesting
you should say that,

14:50.905 --> 14:54.875
because their uniforms were actually
made out of a heavy-duty wool.

14:58.913 --> 15:00.948
- Tim!
- What?

15:01.016 --> 15:02.383
Jenny, I'm sorry.

15:02.951 --> 15:04.318
I'd better go.

15:06.588 --> 15:08.756
Goodbye, five, hello, two.

15:10.959 --> 15:14.061
Dad, I just stuck my
nose in Jenny's eye.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.333
Chicks dig that.

15:21.737 --> 15:25.105
Tim, what in the Sam Hill
are those lights all about?

15:25.840 --> 15:27.041
What lights?

15:27.108 --> 15:29.009
Those blinding
towers of halogen.

15:29.077 --> 15:31.746
Oh, those.
I just got them from work.

15:31.813 --> 15:33.351
I'm trying a new
security-lighting system.

15:33.381 --> 15:36.383
You know darn well they'll screw
up my botany experiments.

15:37.586 --> 15:39.420
Will they?

15:39.487 --> 15:42.222
Constant light
causes photoperiodism.

15:42.290 --> 15:46.093
My plants need 12 hours of
darkness to flower properly!

15:46.160 --> 15:47.695
Do they?

15:47.762 --> 15:52.366
I cannot believe you are being
so petty about this greenhouse.

15:52.433 --> 15:54.701
The design was bogus and overdone.
Even that...

15:54.769 --> 15:56.904
Even that drawing was a joke.

15:56.972 --> 15:58.572
- The drawing was a joke?
- Yes!

15:58.640 --> 16:01.809
No, no, no, Tim. You, those
ridiculous lights, that is the joke!

16:01.877 --> 16:03.310
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

16:03.378 --> 16:05.317
But this is my yard and I can
put up any lights I want.

16:05.347 --> 16:07.518
And this is my property. I'll put
up a ten-foot aluminum wall.

16:07.548 --> 16:09.249
It will reflect
the light back at you.

16:09.317 --> 16:10.489
There are zoning laws, you know!

16:10.519 --> 16:12.019
Then I'll get a variance.

16:12.086 --> 16:14.192
Then I'll get a variance to make my
lights even higher and brighter.

16:14.222 --> 16:15.927
Well, then I'll get another variance
to make my wall even higher.

16:15.957 --> 16:17.162
Well, I guess we got
a lot of work to do!

16:17.192 --> 16:18.725
- Fine!
- Fine!

16:22.831 --> 16:25.633
Hello! Is anybody home?

16:27.469 --> 16:28.870
What the...?

16:28.937 --> 16:30.270
I guess they work, huh?

16:31.039 --> 16:32.706
Tim?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.275
I'm over here.

16:37.545 --> 16:39.813
What is this?
What are you doing?

16:39.881 --> 16:42.650
I'm adding to my arsenal.
Bigger, brighter, better.

16:42.717 --> 16:45.819
This is insane. When is
this idiocy gonna end?

16:45.887 --> 16:47.487
When Wilson grows up.

16:49.724 --> 16:53.060
Wilson is your best friend. If you
keep this up, you're gonna lose him.

16:53.127 --> 16:55.028
So I'll get another best friend.

16:55.096 --> 16:59.766
I'll call Al. Maybe he knows
someone who'll be my best friend.

16:59.768 --> 17:03.637
So you think it's gonna be
that easy to replace Wilson?

17:03.705 --> 17:05.573
You talk to him
about everything.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.477
Whenever we have a fight,
you go outside. You start...

17:11.713 --> 17:14.414
How far did you say this
greenhouse was gonna extend?

17:14.482 --> 17:16.049
Right over to the fence.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.852
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm,
mmm-hmm.

17:20.088 --> 17:21.454
What's that supposed to mean?

17:21.522 --> 17:24.290
I get the feeling if Wilson
didn't live next-door,

17:24.358 --> 17:26.894
I'd be the only one
taking out the garbage.

17:27.162 --> 17:29.596
Uh?

17:29.664 --> 17:33.634
Come on, honey, we both know why you
don't want this greenhouse to happen.

17:33.702 --> 17:35.402
It's ugly.
Tim...

17:35.470 --> 17:36.671
It's a Victorian monstrosity.

17:36.738 --> 17:37.805
Tim...

17:37.873 --> 17:40.641
- It's too big.
- Honey!

17:40.709 --> 17:43.744
It fills up the whole yard. I won't
be able to go out and talk to Wilson.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.445
Exactly.

17:45.513 --> 17:48.849
I really like to be able to go out to
the fence and talk to my friend Wilson.

17:51.086 --> 17:52.752
You know, he's really
good with aluminum.

17:52.820 --> 17:54.821
You gotta give
him that, you know?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.462
Wilson, you're not gonna
need those panels anymore.

18:01.529 --> 18:04.565
Why? You planning
an airborne assault?

18:06.334 --> 18:08.368
I'm taking down the lights.

18:08.437 --> 18:10.570
You're taking down the lights?

18:10.638 --> 18:12.706
Yes. It's your property.

18:12.774 --> 18:16.309
If you want to, you can load it up
with Japanese geishas. I don't care.

18:17.745 --> 18:21.582
You're tunneling in, aren't you?

18:21.650 --> 18:24.951
You know, this isn't about
building a greenhouse.

18:25.019 --> 18:26.620
Well, then what's it about, Tim?

18:26.688 --> 18:29.523
It's so... It would...
It came all the way to...

18:29.591 --> 18:32.926
I would not... I... I really...
There's... It's hard...

18:32.995 --> 18:36.897
I come out...
I like coming to the fence.

18:36.965 --> 18:40.367
To articulate the deep feelings you find
difficult to communicate to other men.

18:40.434 --> 18:41.501
Yes!

18:45.339 --> 18:48.341
You know, Tim, if I build this
greenhouse the way I intended,

18:48.409 --> 18:49.977
you'd have to come
around the house,

18:50.045 --> 18:52.112
knock on the door
if you wanted to talk.

18:52.213 --> 18:56.116
I could do that. I could just call
you on the phone if I wanted to.

18:56.184 --> 18:58.418
I could get a computer.
We could e-mail.

18:58.486 --> 19:00.120
Yeah. Yeah.
We could do that.

19:00.188 --> 19:01.822
Yeah. You want
to do that?

19:01.824 --> 19:03.657
- Nah!
- Nah!

19:03.724 --> 19:04.863
You know, Tim,
to tell you the truth,

19:04.893 --> 19:06.497
I rather enjoy being
able to come out here

19:06.527 --> 19:09.429
and extemporaneously
converse with you.

19:09.497 --> 19:12.132
Not me. I just like
shooting the breeze.

19:14.870 --> 19:19.039
You know, I know I was being
stubborn about this greenhouse, but

19:19.107 --> 19:20.641
there was a reason.

19:20.709 --> 19:23.210
I know. Christmas, '85,

19:23.277 --> 19:25.880
I shot the Lamb of God right
through your living room window.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.180
No. No.

19:30.385 --> 19:32.653
Well, what was the reason then?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.187
You know,
when my wife was alive,

19:34.255 --> 19:37.390
we always dreamed
of having our own greenhouse

19:37.459 --> 19:40.961
where we could grow the plants
we saw all over the world.

19:42.664 --> 19:46.033
So you wanted to build
this in honor of Katherine?

19:47.001 --> 19:49.903
Yeah. She drew
that sketch.

19:51.339 --> 19:52.873
The one I called stupid.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.240
Yes.

19:54.308 --> 19:55.747
I feel terrible.
I wouldn't... I'm sorry.

19:55.777 --> 19:57.477
Why didn't you
just tell me this?

19:57.545 --> 20:01.381
Well, Tim, sometimes it's difficult
for me to talk about my past.

20:01.449 --> 20:04.752
I guess you and I just weren't in
the backyard at the right time.

20:06.621 --> 20:08.460
I don't want you to give up
building the greenhouse now.

20:08.490 --> 20:09.827
Well, I don't want
to give it up, either.

20:09.857 --> 20:11.759
But I'm gonna move
it to the side yard.

20:11.826 --> 20:13.030
You don't have
enough room over there.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.961
So I'll scale her down.

20:15.029 --> 20:18.999
There's good afternoon sun over there.
I can grow some orchids.

20:19.066 --> 20:20.534
I'd still like to
help you build it.

20:21.269 --> 20:23.036
- <i>Great.</i>
- All right!

20:23.104 --> 20:25.539
Well, I'd better get
these lights down and back.

20:25.607 --> 20:27.874
<i>Tool Time</i> set's kind
of dark without them.

20:29.577 --> 20:30.777
You need some help?

20:30.845 --> 20:32.112
No, I'll get them...

20:32.514 --> 20:33.814
Hey!

20:33.881 --> 20:35.449
Are any of those
reflectors parabolic?

20:36.417 --> 20:38.185
Well, yes. Why?

20:38.253 --> 20:41.522
I've got an idea of some fun we can
have a little later on tonight.

21:00.876 --> 21:02.309
Hey, good morning, Wilson.

21:02.377 --> 21:04.044
Well, hidey-ho, Tim.

21:04.112 --> 21:06.247
I'm really glad we
worked things out.

21:06.314 --> 21:09.183
Yes, indeedy. Now we can come
out here and talk all we want.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.818
Yeah. Come out here
and talk all we want.

21:15.623 --> 21:17.524
So, Tim, is something
on your mind?

21:18.760 --> 21:20.461
No, not really.

21:20.528 --> 21:22.730
Maybe you had a quote or an
anecdote you want to share?

21:22.797 --> 21:24.464
No, not a one.

21:26.901 --> 21:28.902
Well, maybe this situation will

21:28.969 --> 21:31.471
remind you of a story
or someone you met.

21:31.539 --> 21:32.839
Nothing comes to mind.

21:32.907 --> 21:34.107
No?

21:36.444 --> 21:38.144
Well, all right then.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.347
Just take out the garbage.

21:40.415 --> 21:43.951
Yeah. I'll go back to grooming my
squirrels for St. Paddy's Day.

21:46.754 --> 21:49.089
Hey, later on, you want
to go moon Borland with me?

21:49.157 --> 21:50.357
I'm there!

21:55.163 --> 21:57.164
- <i>Hi-ho, Tim.</i>
- Hey, Wilson.

21:57.231 --> 21:58.498
- <i>Greetings, Al.</i>
- Greetings.

21:58.566 --> 22:02.069
Well, let's get down to it.
Now, the first step in...

22:05.306 --> 22:07.240
I really wanted to go out to...

22:09.010 --> 22:12.346
I'd be taking out
the garbage all the time.

22:12.413 --> 22:13.413
Uh?

22:14.582 --> 22:16.850
Come on, honey.
You both...

22:17.986 --> 22:19.319
Sorry.
