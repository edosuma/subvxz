03:37.207 --> 03:40.677
Over the water we must go.

03:40.807 --> 03:42.763
- Bhuta.
- You ask of me, Master?

They expect it, don't they.

04:30.847 --> 04:33.805
Lovely lads and so natural.

Ow!

05:50.687 --> 05:52.325
She had my finger, you know...

05:52.447 --> 05:55.564
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.

05:55.687 --> 06:00.363
l thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.

06:03.007 --> 06:05.202
lt's cold. lt's a cold place.

06:06.687 --> 06:10.839

Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?

07:56.087 --> 07:58.237

07:58.367 --> 08:02.155

What are you doing on the floor?

09:02.847 --> 09:05.156
Hey, Bea-atle!

09:05.287 --> 09:08.120
How about this, <i>Shufti?</i>

09:09.127 --> 09:11.482
Gold! All of it, pure gold.

09:11.607 --> 09:14.758
ln easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.481
- Not a mark on them.
- No, l hate them.

09:17.607 --> 09:21.998
- No.
- lt makes your fingers go green.

09:24.447 --> 09:26.677
lt's not the Beatle with the ring.

09:27.487 --> 09:30.923

09:52.127 --> 09:54.960
- lt is not the one.
- My gosh.

09:55.087 --> 09:58.159
They all look the same in their similitude
and language.

09:58.287 --> 10:01.279
Swami, it's raining on your...

10:01.407 --> 10:03.284
After them.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.323

10:31.287 --> 10:33.482
Oh... After them.

10:46.527 --> 10:50.884

Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...

No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...

17:02.847 --> 17:08.365
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.

17:08.487 --> 17:12.526

- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.

18:03.407 --> 18:07.195

- Freemason?

18:07.327 --> 18:11.036
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.

18:11.167 --> 18:16.366

from the mystic east... Or we did have.

18:16.487 --> 18:18.443
(Hollers) Hey, Abdul!

18:18.567 --> 18:21.035

18:21.167 --> 18:24.079
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?

Very nice he was, too.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.883
l've just seen the most amazing thing...

19:26.007 --> 19:27.998
(Gasps) Oh...

19:35.767 --> 19:37.439
Hey, did you...

19:42.287 --> 19:45.085
There's a man down there on his head.

19:46.847 --> 19:48.280
Arthur?

19:49.367 --> 19:50.880
(Whooshes)

19:51.767 --> 19:54.235
Could you pick this up for me, please?

19:57.847 --> 20:00.680
(Sitar music plays)

20:03.127 --> 20:04.480
(Music stops)

20:06.327 --> 20:08.477
Are you eating, too, Paul?

20:12.367 --> 20:15.279
Your friend is in mortal danger.
l can say no more.

20:15.407 --> 20:17.398
(Gasping)

20:18.367 --> 20:21.165
(Music resumes)

20:21.887 --> 20:23.923
lt's rather a jolly place.

20:25.007 --> 20:28.317
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.

20:28.447 --> 20:29.960
He has three hours to live.

20:30.087 --> 20:31.759
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

20:34.327 --> 20:36.158
l ordered soup too.

20:36.287 --> 20:38.881
- Soup!
- Soup.

20:48.927 --> 20:53.796
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.

20:53.927 --> 20:56.077
- Unless l'm mistaken.
- ls it?

20:56.207 --> 20:59.517
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.

20:59.647 --> 21:01.399
- Say no more.
- l can say no more.

21:01.527 --> 21:04.917
Excuse me. lf he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,

21:05.047 --> 21:06.719
why is he not painted red?

21:06.847 --> 21:12.479
l've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend l will.

21:14.647 --> 21:18.037
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.

21:18.167 --> 21:22.001
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.

21:22.127 --> 21:23.958
All are happy to go.

21:24.087 --> 21:27.363
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring

21:27.487 --> 21:29.955
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.

21:30.087 --> 21:33.762
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.

21:33.887 --> 21:38.563
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so l'm told, with that ring.

21:38.687 --> 21:40.086
Three hours to live.

21:40.207 --> 21:43.756
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.879
You are lucky to be chosen!

21:47.007 --> 21:50.556
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.

21:51.647 --> 21:54.957
- What's this?
- A season ticket.

21:55.087 --> 21:58.159
l like a lot of seasoning in my soup.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.843
There's somebody been in this soup.

22:02.967 --> 22:06.721
l got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.

22:06.847 --> 22:09.998
l get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.

22:11.727 --> 22:13.843
No? Come off!

22:13.967 --> 22:17.960
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,

22:18.087 --> 22:20.157
who will then go happy to Kaili.

22:20.287 --> 22:22.084
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.

22:22.687 --> 22:24.723
There's a footprint in here.

22:24.847 --> 22:26.963
Here, you have a go.

22:28.647 --> 22:30.205
(Gasps) Flee!

22:36.327 --> 22:38.716
(Woman screams)

22:54.607 --> 22:58.316
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.

22:58.447 --> 22:59.766
(Laughs)

22:59.887 --> 23:01.798
This ring is not stone.

23:01.927 --> 23:05.681
- l've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.

23:13.087 --> 23:17.603
- l don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?

23:17.727 --> 23:21.356
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.

23:21.487 --> 23:26.607
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.

23:26.727 --> 23:28.797
Three ten.

23:28.927 --> 23:30.519
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.

23:30.647 --> 23:34.959
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.

23:35.087 --> 23:37.681
(Whirring)

23:47.447 --> 23:50.120
- l've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.

23:50.247 --> 23:54.240
- l suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.

23:54.367 --> 23:57.359
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.

23:57.487 --> 24:01.560
- Did you want them to?
- No. l left it there when not at school.

24:01.687 --> 24:03.962
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.

24:04.087 --> 24:06.396
(Electronic beeping)

24:09.647 --> 24:12.480
l like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.

24:13.527 --> 24:15.245
This won't work.

24:15.367 --> 24:18.359
lt could work if the government
would spend more money.

24:18.487 --> 24:20.284
Made in America you see.

24:21.167 --> 24:22.805
Another failure.

24:22.927 --> 24:25.885
The idea is...
The idea as l see it

24:26.007 --> 24:30.125
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.

24:30.247 --> 24:33.956
- What's your electricity bill like?
- lt's sort of a long counterfoil.

24:34.087 --> 24:36.282
lt's not dropping off.

24:38.527 --> 24:42.202
Voltage!
Voltage...up, up...

24:42.327 --> 24:43.646
Up, up!

24:43.767 --> 24:47.316
- Are you sure l'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.

24:47.447 --> 24:50.484
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.

24:50.607 --> 24:52.643
This is English.

24:52.767 --> 24:56.282
- ls it green, the earth in America?
- ln some places it's brown.

24:56.407 --> 24:57.920
He's not earthed.

24:58.047 --> 25:02.040
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. l ask you!

25:05.367 --> 25:06.880
Done.

25:08.527 --> 25:10.802
- 5... 4...
- Come on.

25:11.527 --> 25:16.442
3-2-1 -go! l observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.

25:16.567 --> 25:18.797
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.

25:18.927 --> 25:22.761
lt's the plugs.
Good British plugs.

25:22.887 --> 25:27.005
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.

25:27.127 --> 25:29.243
- How do you feel?
- l used to use my hands.

25:29.367 --> 25:31.358
He used to use his hands.

25:33.167 --> 25:36.159
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?

25:36.287 --> 25:39.404
- Voltage...up!
- l'm no mean hand at the old sticks.

25:41.687 --> 25:43.439
The voltage, up, up, up!

25:43.567 --> 25:46.877
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!

25:48.767 --> 25:50.564
The bunker!

25:52.687 --> 25:54.723
(Electronic humming)

25:59.607 --> 26:03.486
- l can't watch.
- lt's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.

26:03.607 --> 26:05.723
(Whirring)

26:10.887 --> 26:12.525
Stop it!

26:12.647 --> 26:14.603
lt's more than my job's worth!

26:14.727 --> 26:17.799
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.

26:17.927 --> 26:20.839
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!

26:31.887 --> 26:33.525
Fantastic!

26:33.647 --> 26:37.720
With a ring like that l could,
dare l say it, rule the world.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.805
l must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.

26:40.927 --> 26:44.840
Get your hands off him
or l'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!

26:44.967 --> 26:46.605
The laser...

26:46.727 --> 26:50.515
- Get him off.
- l must have this ring. The laser.

26:51.247 --> 26:56.446
Halt! Release him or l'll shoot
and l am a dead eyeshot shooting.

26:56.567 --> 26:59.001
- l've got it.
- Switch off that machine.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.483
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...

27:04.607 --> 27:07.758
l'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.

27:07.887 --> 27:11.243
MlT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.676
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.

27:13.807 --> 27:16.799
That's where l get it from,
my love of animals.

27:16.927 --> 27:20.636
They trust me.
l should have been in vivisection.

27:20.767 --> 27:24.555
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.

27:24.687 --> 27:27.997
Well, that was a mistake.
l can vouch for her. We're very close.

27:28.887 --> 27:31.526
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!

27:32.927 --> 27:34.918
(Laser Beeps)

27:35.807 --> 27:37.365
(Bang)

27:38.647 --> 27:41.480
lt's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.

27:43.087 --> 27:46.921
lt's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

27:50.607 --> 27:52.563
( THE BEATLES:
''You've Got to Hide Your Love Away'')

27:52.687 --> 27:56.236
Here l stand with head in hand

27:56.367 --> 27:59.359
Turn my face to the wall

28:00.487 --> 28:04.366
lf she's gone l can't go on

28:04.487 --> 28:09.117
Feeling two foot small

28:10.367 --> 28:14.201
Ev'rywhere people stare

28:14.327 --> 28:17.205
Each and ev'ryday

28:18.007 --> 28:22.000
l can see them laugh at me

28:22.127 --> 28:26.723
And l hear them say

28:30.047 --> 28:35.758
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

28:37.847 --> 28:42.557
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

28:45.607 --> 28:49.600
How can l even try?

28:49.727 --> 28:52.719
l can never win

28:53.727 --> 28:57.561
Hearing them, seeing them

28:57.687 --> 29:03.159
ln the state l'm in

29:03.287 --> 29:07.405
How could she say to me

29:07.527 --> 29:10.166
''Love will find a way''?

29:11.287 --> 29:15.121
Gather 'round all you clowns

29:15.247 --> 29:20.367
Let me hear you say

29:22.967 --> 29:28.280
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

29:30.807 --> 29:36.279
''Hey, you've got to hide
your love away!''

29:57.047 --> 29:58.765
l have here...

29:58.887 --> 30:00.798
(Gasps)

30:00.927 --> 30:03.839
Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.

30:03.967 --> 30:07.642
No! lt is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.

30:07.767 --> 30:11.237
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,

30:11.367 --> 30:13.756
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?

30:13.887 --> 30:17.357
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.

30:17.487 --> 30:21.605
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen

30:21.727 --> 30:24.560
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.

30:24.687 --> 30:28.316
Now my sister is safe and rises up.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.159
(Soft clang)

30:35.687 --> 30:39.680
(Ahme ) 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'

30:39.807 --> 30:43.686
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.

30:46.047 --> 30:48.515
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.126
Don't look.

30:50.247 --> 30:53.398
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.362
(Birds chirp)

31:05.767 --> 31:09.123
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.

31:09.247 --> 31:13.684
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.

31:21.607 --> 31:23.757
There might be some insurance.

31:23.887 --> 31:26.640
l wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.

31:26.767 --> 31:28.962
What did you say that stuff is?

31:29.087 --> 31:33.205
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. lt's a minor medical secret.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.682
l'm sure there's no call for all this.

31:35.807 --> 31:39.766
l'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.

31:39.887 --> 31:43.243
- Gum?
- Are you sure it's not or habit forming?

31:43.367 --> 31:46.086
No. As long as you don't swallow it.

32:03.807 --> 32:06.526
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.

32:06.647 --> 32:09.639
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.

32:16.527 --> 32:18.006
Kaili.

32:18.127 --> 32:21.199
Kaili. Kaili.

32:21.327 --> 32:25.559
l promise you
the effect is purely transitory.

32:25.687 --> 32:27.200
lt wears off very quickly.

32:27.327 --> 32:30.876
(Doorbell rings)
(Ahme ) Don't answer it! lt's Clang.

32:32.047 --> 32:33.958
(Hollering and knocking)

32:34.087 --> 32:37.716
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.

32:37.847 --> 32:39.326
(Hollering)

32:39.447 --> 32:41.756
(Ringo ) Come on, my finger!

32:42.567 --> 32:44.398
Where's Paul?

32:44.527 --> 32:48.236
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.

32:49.127 --> 32:51.163
Where's he gone?

32:51.287 --> 32:53.642
- Where are you, Paul?
- lt's his best suit.

33:13.807 --> 33:17.482
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.

33:19.887 --> 33:21.684
(Baby crying)

33:24.607 --> 33:27.121
- Standby.
- (Whispers) Standby.

33:27.247 --> 33:29.715
Look out!
They're coming through the door!

33:29.847 --> 33:31.997
(Knocking)

33:36.287 --> 33:38.278
- Go!
- Go!

33:41.927 --> 33:44.077
(Yells) Kaili!

33:50.087 --> 33:52.237
Kaili... Oh!

33:56.487 --> 33:58.876
- Sorry, l hit him.
- Oh!

34:00.887 --> 34:03.845
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.

34:03.967 --> 34:06.401
Kaili! Kaili!

34:08.806 --> 34:10.559
(Gasps) Get off!

34:14.047 --> 34:16.958
- lt's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.

34:17.087 --> 34:18.725
Well, stop it!

34:22.367 --> 34:24.562
Feet! Feet, you fool!

35:02.767 --> 35:05.759
(Growls)

35:14.287 --> 35:17.438
(Sobs)

35:19.647 --> 35:22.559
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!

35:26.247 --> 35:28.078
(Gunshot)

35:35.287 --> 35:38.199
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!

35:38.327 --> 35:40.045
Up!

35:41.087 --> 35:42.759
Up, up, up!

35:42.887 --> 35:44.878
- You!
- Which one has the ring?

35:45.007 --> 35:47.282
That one with the large ned.

35:47.407 --> 35:49.318
Neb!
And it's yours.

35:49.447 --> 35:53.599
- Keep your hands up.
- How can l get it off with my hands up?

35:54.647 --> 35:56.842
ln the name of science
l demand that ring.

35:56.967 --> 35:58.446
lt's yours!

35:58.567 --> 36:01.684
- lt's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.

36:01.807 --> 36:06.119
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.

36:06.247 --> 36:10.160
With a ring like that
could l interest the military?

36:10.287 --> 36:11.766
No, l could not.

36:11.887 --> 36:13.957
l can't get it off.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.165
(Squelch)

36:18.687 --> 36:20.917
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.

36:21.047 --> 36:24.517

54:38.567 --> 54:41.286
You were so sincere

54:41.407 --> 54:45.525
Treat me like you did
the night before

54:46.527 --> 54:48.085
Yes...

54:52.767 --> 54:55.281
When l held you near

54:55.407 --> 54:58.558
You were so sincere

54:58.687 --> 55:02.521
Treat me like you did
the night before

55:03.247 --> 55:05.886
Like the night before

55:11.407 --> 55:14.319
- Hey!
- We're being attacked!

55:19.887 --> 55:21.923
(Gunfire )

55:26.247 --> 55:28.807
(Man yells) Retreat! Retreat!

55:31.687 --> 55:34.963
Come on! We're being fired at!
Get out of here!

55:38.247 --> 55:40.203
Come on! Retreat!

55:49.687 --> 55:51.484
Run!

55:54.607 --> 55:56.598
Quick! Faster!

55:57.647 --> 55:59.797
Hey, mind the tank!

56:06.647 --> 56:08.444
Get up, Johnny!

56:08.567 --> 56:12.196
- Stop!
- Johnny! Walk for me. You can do it!

56:13.087 --> 56:15.999
ln here! Quickly! Quick!

56:36.287 --> 56:38.562
- Fire!
- (Yells) Fire!

56:41.847 --> 56:43.599
Fire!

56:51.287 --> 56:52.800
Fire!

56:54.567 --> 56:58.799
- Left! Steady on. 1 -500.
- 1 -500.

56:58.927 --> 57:01.566
l regret losing a lieutenant
as able as Ahme

57:01.687 --> 57:03.962
but she was told the price of capture.

57:04.087 --> 57:07.284
- Enemy tank moving from left to right.
- Loaded.

57:07.407 --> 57:11.082
- Well, fire the nasty thing.
- Firing now, <i>Saheb.</i>

57:15.287 --> 57:17.278
Missed! You naughty boys.

57:23.287 --> 57:26.199
Turn us right.

57:31.087 --> 57:32.725
Fire!

57:38.887 --> 57:40.878
( ''1 81 2 Overture'' plays)

57:45.567 --> 57:47.876
(Cheering)

58:27.647 --> 58:32.243
There must be somewhere in England
where one can find sanctuary to think.

58:36.127 --> 58:39.278
How's your equilibrium, Ringo?

58:39.407 --> 58:42.160
How's yours?
You're light again, George.

58:42.287 --> 58:45.518
- How do you know it's not you.
- Cos l never am, am l Paul?

58:45.647 --> 58:47.956
Here, cop this, one hand!

58:49.087 --> 58:51.043
- (John) Ugly, though.
- The hands?

58:52.167 --> 58:56.877
- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.

58:58.647 --> 59:00.797
- You want to chuck one in?
- Get on!

59:00.927 --> 59:04.363
- How about drumming, though?
- lt won't affect it.

59:04.487 --> 59:07.524
l don't know many...

59:07.647 --> 59:10.957
lt appears l need one card.
l'm chucking one in.

59:11.087 --> 59:12.759
Very light-hearted.

59:12.887 --> 59:15.526
- Discarding it.
- Like an old boot.

59:15.647 --> 59:18.366
They're talking about your finger,
you know.

59:18.487 --> 59:21.445
One card. Dealer takes one.

59:21.567 --> 59:23.364
See, that didn't hurt.

59:23.487 --> 59:27.366
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.

59:27.487 --> 59:29.762
Well, l don't just drum with it, do l?

59:29.887 --> 59:31.878
- What else then?
- l use it, you know.

59:32.367 --> 59:35.006
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
l'll raise you.

59:36.047 --> 59:39.562
You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.

59:39.687 --> 59:42.884
Me and Paul haven't seen you
use of that finger, have we?

59:43.007 --> 59:45.282
- No.
- And again.

59:45.407 --> 59:49.286
We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.

59:49.847 --> 59:51.644
That bloke with Scott,

59:51.767 --> 59:55.237
l've always admired the way he went
into the snow for his mates.

59:55.367 --> 59:58.165
- And again.
- You're joking!

01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:03.484
Just hold this drumstick.

01:00:11.767 --> 01:00:14.759
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.

01:00:14.887 --> 01:00:17.720
- lt's like having a tooth out.
- l've got a good hand.

01:00:17.847 --> 01:00:20.839
You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.

01:00:20.967 --> 01:00:23.640
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.

01:00:23.767 --> 01:00:25.962
l will see... l've won it.

01:00:26.087 --> 01:00:27.805
- Cut.
- No!

01:00:29.887 --> 01:00:32.355
l think tea, don't you? Tea.

01:00:32.487 --> 01:00:35.365
They expect me to cut my finger off.

01:00:35.487 --> 01:00:36.966
The famous finger, eh?

01:00:37.087 --> 01:00:40.363
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,

01:00:40.487 --> 01:00:43.877
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?

01:00:45.887 --> 01:00:48.481
What's that... lt's haunted, you know.

01:00:48.607 --> 01:00:52.759
- Are you going to cut?
- No, l'm not and let that be an end to it.

01:00:52.887 --> 01:00:55.003
End to it!

01:00:55.127 --> 01:00:57.436
This wing of the palace is haunted.

01:01:13.087 --> 01:01:15.237
We won't leave this palace alive.

01:01:15.367 --> 01:01:18.757
The Queen will have something
to say about that.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:21.003
- What's that?
- l beg your pardon?

01:01:21.127 --> 01:01:24.961
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- l daren't look!

01:01:31.367 --> 01:01:33.403
lt's only a hose.

01:01:37.407 --> 01:01:39.602
(Whistle blows softly)

01:01:39.727 --> 01:01:43.402
- lt's for you.
- lt's the gardener.

01:01:49.167 --> 01:01:51.397
l'll stick it out the window.

01:01:53.607 --> 01:01:56.280
(Marching feet)

01:01:57.287 --> 01:01:59.005
(Man) Eyes left.

01:02:02.487 --> 01:02:04.762
(Gas hisses)

01:02:04.887 --> 01:02:06.878
(Man) Eyes front!

01:02:11.207 --> 01:02:12.879
Must be their tea break.

01:02:15.207 --> 01:02:17.516
Hands up!

01:02:17.647 --> 01:02:19.763
Hands up! Quick!

01:02:19.887 --> 01:02:22.640
Come on, lets have you.

01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:25.076
Steady!

01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:30.759
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...

01:02:32.967 --> 01:02:35.117
Lets have that ring.

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:40.125
(Gunshots)

01:02:52.887 --> 01:02:54.878
lt's me, you fool.

01:02:57.367 --> 01:03:00.882
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!

01:03:01.007 --> 01:03:03.601
This should work,
it's from Harvard.

01:03:04.407 --> 01:03:08.559
- lt looks like a laser.
- lt's a relativity cadenza.

01:03:08.687 --> 01:03:10.757
That should slow them down a bit.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:13.560
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:18.955
Hurry up with the plug,
l'll align the sights... Yes!

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:20.884
Right, good.

01:03:21.007 --> 01:03:22.963
l think it is a laser.

01:03:23.087 --> 01:03:24.998
Oh!

01:03:25.127 --> 01:03:27.118
(Sighs) Oh...

01:03:29.087 --> 01:03:31.442
(Relativity cadenza whooshes)

01:03:43.727 --> 01:03:45.399
A royal fuse has just blown.

01:03:45.527 --> 01:03:47.279
(Cadenza stops)

01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:52.075
- lt is a rela...teva...camenza...
- Bad machine!

01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:06.285
(Cadenza starts)

01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:09.763
Hair dryer, l'll bet
she had one for Christmas.

01:04:10.687 --> 01:04:11.642
(Whistling)

01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:16.164
We are going for a friendly walk
with the police down by the river.

01:04:16.287 --> 01:04:18.482
Ooh, look at that.

01:04:18.607 --> 01:04:21.326
- lt's a band.
- (Bagpipe music plays)

01:04:29.167 --> 01:04:31.476
Paint! Paint!

01:04:32.447 --> 01:04:35.837
(Yells) Come on, quickly!
Get them, men. l'm with you.

01:04:35.967 --> 01:04:39.277
After them! After them! Quick!

01:04:40.367 --> 01:04:42.358
Look.

01:04:47.087 --> 01:04:48.964
Oh, lovely pub.

01:04:49.687 --> 01:04:52.918
Two lagers and lime
and two lagers and lime, please.

01:04:59.967 --> 01:05:04.438
- Looks like it's me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.

01:05:06.687 --> 01:05:10.362
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?

01:05:10.487 --> 01:05:12.205
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?

01:05:12.327 --> 01:05:15.603
Look John, l've had some great times
with this finger.

01:05:15.727 --> 01:05:18.082
How do you know l wouldn't miss it?

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.163
You're a rat underneath.

01:05:20.287 --> 01:05:23.438
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.

01:05:23.567 --> 01:05:26.764
lt's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it.

01:05:26.887 --> 01:05:29.765
- ls there a cure for nail biting?
- (Paul) Oh, yes.

01:05:29.887 --> 01:05:31.684
Oh, yes!

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:36.282
l'm always getting winked at these days.
lt used to be you, Paul.

01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:49.400
Oh, Sorry Ringo.

01:05:49.527 --> 01:05:51.358
Peep boo!

01:06:22.887 --> 01:06:26.118
All the rungs have been neatly sawn
in the middle.

01:06:29.447 --> 01:06:31.085
Ah, the window!

01:06:31.207 --> 01:06:33.880
(Roaring)

01:06:36.287 --> 01:06:38.926
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.

01:06:39.047 --> 01:06:41.880
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.

01:06:47.927 --> 01:06:50.487

(Bottle clinks)

01:07:06.847 --> 01:07:09.884
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.

01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:17.037
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?

01:07:20.327 --> 01:07:21.646
lt goes like this...

Oh, here you are...

01:07:41.447 --> 01:07:43.438
Permit me.

01:07:46.687 --> 01:07:51.363
lt's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.

01:07:51.487 --> 01:07:53.796
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.

01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:57.761
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.

01:07:57.887 --> 01:08:02.642
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.

01:08:02.767 --> 01:08:08.125
(John) Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.

- Nobody will know.

We're not going there.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:16.358
For l have got another girl

01:13:16.487 --> 01:13:20.526
Another girl, another girl

01:13:25.767 --> 01:13:28.076
- Let's play a game, eh? Beep-beeps.
- OK.

01:13:32.847 --> 01:13:34.838
Beep-beep, beep-beep!

01:13:36.447 --> 01:13:38.563
(Hollering)

01:13:38.687 --> 01:13:40.359
Oh, oh, oh!

01:13:44.047 --> 01:13:46.800
Radar's broken! Never mind.

01:13:48.487 --> 01:13:51.763
(Hollers) Beatles! Hello!

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:53.764
Port... Starboard... Over there!

01:13:53.887 --> 01:13:56.401
Oh, oh, oh!

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:01.603
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!

01:14:05.647 --> 01:14:07.638
Open that rock!

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:11.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.966
- ls that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!

01:14:14.087 --> 01:14:17.557
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.

01:14:17.687 --> 01:14:20.406
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.

01:14:20.527 --> 01:14:23.963
- What's this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.

01:14:24.087 --> 01:14:26.555
You don't go for all that,
do you?

01:14:26.687 --> 01:14:28.723
Keeps you busy, eh?

01:14:28.847 --> 01:14:32.920
- Do you know where Clang is?
- l'm his mother and he's a good boy.

01:14:33.047 --> 01:14:34.366
(Hollering)

01:14:34.487 --> 01:14:37.047
l don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...

01:14:37.167 --> 01:14:40.318
- ln here, quick.
- (Ringo ) l can't swim.

01:14:42.367 --> 01:14:44.483
l'm not going!

01:14:50.727 --> 01:14:52.285
Where have they gone?

01:15:11.247 --> 01:15:13.363
- Let's go back and get them!
- l'm game.

01:15:13.487 --> 01:15:16.957
- Let's smash them!
- Let's find that temple.

01:15:17.087 --> 01:15:20.921
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- l don't like running away.

01:15:21.047 --> 01:15:24.119
- Let's go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.

01:15:24.247 --> 01:15:27.762
- Not if l get the boot in first.
- Let's go back and get them.

01:15:27.887 --> 01:15:33.007
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...

01:15:47.527 --> 01:15:50.325
- Signpost.
- Signpost.

01:15:50.447 --> 01:15:52.483
- Guide book.
- Guide book.

01:15:52.607 --> 01:15:55.280
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!

01:15:56.887 --> 01:15:58.366
Red light.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.796
Kaili!

01:16:00.927 --> 01:16:03.885
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!

01:16:12.887 --> 01:16:16.197
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.

01:16:16.327 --> 01:16:19.364
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!

01:16:30.407 --> 01:16:34.719
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?

01:16:34.847 --> 01:16:38.283
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.

01:16:38.407 --> 01:16:41.285
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.

01:16:41.407 --> 01:16:45.366
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! l saw those footprints...

01:16:45.487 --> 01:16:47.921
And this guidebook.

01:16:48.047 --> 01:16:50.436
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:06.401
After them...slowly!

01:17:22.207 --> 01:17:26.439
- That's not it, is it?
- lt's on the map as being here.

01:17:26.567 --> 01:17:31.163
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...

01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:34.916
- l'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?

01:17:35.047 --> 01:17:39.120
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. lt's gone.

01:17:39.247 --> 01:17:42.000
l hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.

01:17:42.127 --> 01:17:44.687
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.

01:17:44.807 --> 01:17:49.722
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples

01:17:49.847 --> 01:17:52.315
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.

01:17:52.447 --> 01:17:54.961
That's my theory.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.759
Ugh!

01:17:56.887 --> 01:17:59.321
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.

01:17:59.447 --> 01:18:02.166
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?

01:18:02.287 --> 01:18:04.926
- l haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:06.685
- l have had.
- l will have.

01:18:08.607 --> 01:18:11.201
He's a bit soft that lnspector,
isn't he?

01:18:11.327 --> 01:18:13.363
He never takes his hat off.

01:18:13.487 --> 01:18:15.955
lt's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.

01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:33.198
- l'm off.
- Typical!

01:18:36.287 --> 01:18:38.164
(Yells) Kaili!

01:18:38.287 --> 01:18:40.118
Argh!

01:18:40.247 --> 01:18:42.283
- Kaili!
- Kaili!

01:18:44.847 --> 01:18:46.644
(Electric buzz)

01:18:46.767 --> 01:18:51.204
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:52.965
The fiends!

01:19:06.887 --> 01:19:09.082
(Hollers) Help me!

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:10.526
Help!

01:19:10.647 --> 01:19:12.365
He's mine!

01:19:13.087 --> 01:19:14.486
Help!

01:19:16.087 --> 01:19:17.566
Help me!

01:19:43.407 --> 01:19:46.240
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one.

01:19:49.167 --> 01:19:52.921
Come here, boy! Let me explain.

01:19:54.927 --> 01:19:57.999
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.

01:20:01.287 --> 01:20:03.562
Back up and smash him off.

01:20:03.687 --> 01:20:06.360
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!

01:20:08.127 --> 01:20:11.119
Oh! Never mind. Try again.

01:20:12.527 --> 01:20:14.404
This should give him a headache.

01:20:17.647 --> 01:20:19.638
Where's he gone?

01:20:21.007 --> 01:20:24.204
- That's done it, he's gone.
- l can't start the car.

01:20:24.327 --> 01:20:26.761
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.

01:20:26.887 --> 01:20:29.640
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...

01:20:31.887 --> 01:20:33.081
On, on!

01:20:37.007 --> 01:20:39.237
l seem to be having
a slight difficulty.

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:42.279
To the right! oh...

01:20:51.647 --> 01:20:53.842
- l think it might be the wrong key.
- On!

01:20:56.967 --> 01:20:58.719
On!

01:21:00.127 --> 01:21:02.641
(Engine starts)

01:21:05.047 --> 01:21:07.515
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?

01:21:20.807 --> 01:21:22.798
Thanks for the lift, sailor!

01:21:29.287 --> 01:21:31.847
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.

01:21:31.967 --> 01:21:34.083
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.

01:21:34.207 --> 01:21:36.163
Superintendent, you've got a plan.

01:21:36.287 --> 01:21:38.198
- Yes...
- Superintendent.

01:21:38.327 --> 01:21:39.646
l've got a plan.

01:23:21.927 --> 01:23:23.997
(Hollers) Ringo!

01:23:24.127 --> 01:23:25.685
Ringo!

01:23:25.807 --> 01:23:28.560
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

01:23:28.687 --> 01:23:31.406
- Ringo!
- Ringo!

01:23:31.527 --> 01:23:33.006
Ringo!

01:23:33.127 --> 01:23:35.163
(Dogs bark)

01:23:35.287 --> 01:23:36.845
Ringo!

01:23:46.647 --> 01:23:48.205
All right, talk!

01:23:48.327 --> 01:23:51.239
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?

01:23:55.887 --> 01:23:58.355
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?

01:23:58.487 --> 01:24:01.126
- l'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.

01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:04.045
Alas... Scalpel.

01:24:04.167 --> 01:24:05.680
Sca...

01:24:13.207 --> 01:24:15.801
Sand in the generator.

01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:19.397
lt gets everywhere. No wonder
l never get anything done.

01:24:19.527 --> 01:24:21.677
Fix it, Algernon.

01:24:22.487 --> 01:24:25.240
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.

01:24:25.367 --> 01:24:26.686
Fix it!

01:24:26.807 --> 01:24:30.800
l'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.

01:24:30.927 --> 01:24:34.078
- lt's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.

01:24:38.487 --> 01:24:40.000
l've got some juice.

01:24:41.087 --> 01:24:45.080
(Ringo ) l can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!

01:24:45.207 --> 01:24:49.405
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.

01:24:49.527 --> 01:24:50.880
Hands up!

01:24:52.807 --> 01:24:55.446
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...

01:24:55.567 --> 01:25:00.163
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?

01:25:00.287 --> 01:25:05.566
At last! l'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!

01:25:05.687 --> 01:25:08.724
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that l have this.

01:25:08.847 --> 01:25:11.486
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...

01:25:11.607 --> 01:25:15.919
lt's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!

01:25:16.047 --> 01:25:18.766
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?

01:25:18.887 --> 01:25:21.162
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!

01:25:21.287 --> 01:25:24.563
- (Algernon) l don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?

01:25:24.687 --> 01:25:27.804
- (Algernon) l don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.

01:25:27.927 --> 01:25:29.599
- Now!
- Right!

01:25:34.007 --> 01:25:37.079
- l can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?

01:25:43.807 --> 01:25:46.241
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...

01:25:47.127 --> 01:25:50.164
ln the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,

01:25:50.287 --> 01:25:53.120
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.

01:25:53.247 --> 01:25:55.841
- Wait till my mates get you.
- l don't think so...

01:25:55.967 --> 01:26:00.757
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.

01:26:00.887 --> 01:26:03.447
They're quite merciless.

01:26:03.567 --> 01:26:06.479
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.

01:26:09.527 --> 01:26:12.087
Oh, mother Kaili,

01:26:12.207 --> 01:26:14.163
whose name is the Terrible...

01:26:14.287 --> 01:26:16.278
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.

01:26:16.407 --> 01:26:19.205
(Clang) ...whose name
is the lnaccessible,

01:26:19.327 --> 01:26:23.843
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!

01:26:24.647 --> 01:26:26.365
We turn our hearts to...

01:26:26.487 --> 01:26:28.239
(Ringo ) No!

01:26:28.367 --> 01:26:30.198
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...

01:26:30.327 --> 01:26:33.125
- lt's off! l'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,

01:26:33.247 --> 01:26:37.160
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...

01:26:37.287 --> 01:26:40.120
Get sacrificed!
l don't subscribe to your religion!

01:26:41.447 --> 01:26:45.326
- There he is!
- lt just came off!

01:26:45.447 --> 01:26:47.199
(Yells) Quickly! After them!

01:26:47.327 --> 01:26:49.283
l'm going to miss the sacrifice.

01:26:49.407 --> 01:26:53.116
- lt came off! l just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?

01:26:53.247 --> 01:26:56.364
- You're all red again.
- l'm beginning to like it.

01:26:56.487 --> 01:26:59.559
Ah... So! Ha!

01:26:59.687 --> 01:27:01.723
He who wears the ring...

01:27:02.407 --> 01:27:04.477
Help! l need somebody

01:27:04.607 --> 01:27:07.041
Help! Not just anybody

01:27:07.167 --> 01:27:09.556
Help! You know l need someone

01:27:09.687 --> 01:27:11.200
Help!

When l was younger,

01:27:17.407 --> 01:27:21.639
l never needed anybody's help

01:27:22.527 --> 01:27:27.647

And now my life has changed
in oh so many ways

01:27:58.287 --> 01:28:02.565
My independence seems to vanish
in the haze

01:28:03.327 --> 01:28:07.843
But ev'ry now and then
l feel so insecure

01:28:07.967 --> 01:28:12.757

''The Barber of Seville'')

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:31.682
