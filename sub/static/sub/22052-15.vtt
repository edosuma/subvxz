She can't even show up to a

Sonoma and he just seemed a

11:00.800 --> 11:03.900

something.

I still think he...

11:34.800 --> 11:36.000

then, though. Call him.

Say, "Hey, is everything okay
when we went to Williams Sonoma?

11:39.133 --> 11:41.467
You seemed a little off."
I'm so sick of people, like, not

11:41.467 --> 11:46.667
saying anything, though.
I am just over everybody feeling

11:46.667 --> 11:50.033

know, about every little detail

my own priorities and things

that I need to focus on.
He's just not, like, my biggest

12:03.633 --> 12:07.567
concern anymore.

because we were supposed to hang
out.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.700
the kids ended up going to the
fair.

for him.

have gone to the fair.

You know, and I'm like, "It's
not that serious, guys."

do something on my own."

You stepped up to the plate.

supposed to-- like, we can't
figure it out for her.

check out your guest house and

20:42.433 --> 20:45.767
let you know that last night,
Scott called me at, like, 2:00

20:45.767 --> 20:47.400
in the morning.
>> KHLOE: 'Kay.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.567
>> KOURTNEY: Which, he never
calls me late at night, ever.

20:50.567 --> 20:53.400
And he was just, like, ranting.
Like, "What are we doing in

20:53.400 --> 20:55.967
life?
What are you doing?

20:55.967 --> 20:58.066
What am I doing?"
And then I'll go, "But what are

20:58.066 --> 20:59.800
you doing?"
And then-- or then he'll say,

20:59.800 --> 21:02.967
"But what are you doing?
Is it any better?

21:02.967 --> 21:04.633
Is, like, what are you doing?"
And then...

21:04.633 --> 21:06.333
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God.
At 2:00 a.m.?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.233
>> KOURTNEY: 2:00 a.m.
And then by the end of the

21:08.233 --> 21:12.500
conversation, I just was like,
"I have a boyfriend, and he's 24

21:12.500 --> 21:15.467
years old!
It's not the craziest thing

21:15.467 --> 21:17.033
that's ever happened in the
world."

21:17.033 --> 21:20.333
And, so, he was like, "He's your
boyfriend?!" And then he...

21:20.333 --> 21:21.734
>> KHLOE: That was a trigger,
of course!

21:21.734 --> 21:23.300
>> KOURTNEY: And then he hung up
the phone.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.900
>> KHLOE: Stop!
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.233
>> KHLOE: And did you call him
back?

21:26.233 --> 21:27.934
>> KOURTNEY: No.
I went to bed.

21:27.934 --> 21:30.000
>> KHLOE: You just let it go?
>> KOURTNEY: I just went to bed.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.967
>> KHLOE: Wow.
Cut the cord.

21:34.967 --> 21:36.867
And, so, what?

21:38.633 --> 21:41.233
>> KRIS: Each and every LifeGem
diamond is certified for

21:41.233 --> 21:42.934

>> KIM: Oh, my God!

21:42.934 --> 21:45.667
I could turn your body into
that Asscher cut diamond.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.066
>> KRIS:  Yes.
>> KIM: Come with me.

21:47.066 --> 21:50.000
>> KOURTNEY: Like, literally,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.166
you have to talk to him
like... like crazy.

21:53.166 --> 21:56.300
Otherwise he won't listen.
When is it gonna be enough?

21:56.300 --> 22:06.967
I have three kids to take care
of.

22:06.967 --> 22:09.533
>> KOURTNEY: By the end of the
conversation, I just was like,

22:09.533 --> 22:11.800
"I have a boyfriend."
>> KHLOE: Stop!

22:11.800 --> 22:13.200
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> KHLOE: And did you call him

22:13.200 --> 22:15.166
back?
>> KOURTNEY: No. I went to bed.

22:15.166 --> 22:17.767
>> KHLOE: You just let it go?
>> KOURTNEY: I just went to bed.

22:17.767 --> 22:21.967
>> KHLOE: Wow.
Cut the cord.

22:21.967 --> 22:24.300
>> KOURTNEY: Got to do what you
got to do.

22:24.300 --> 22:27.800
But also, I just thought he
knew-- like, I've...

22:27.800 --> 22:29.433
>> KHLOE: No, no, no.
He'll never assume.

22:29.433 --> 22:31.200
Are you kidding me?
>> KOURTNEY: But I just thought,

22:31.200 --> 22:33.367
"How could he not know?"
We've been to Saint-Tropez.

22:33.367 --> 22:34.767
We've been to Egypt.
>> KHLOE: I didn't know it was

22:34.767 --> 22:36.000
your boyfriend.
>> KOURTNEY: But what do you

22:36.000 --> 22:37.500
think, I'd just go on these...
>> KHLOE: No, I thought it...

22:37.500 --> 22:39.100
>> KOURTNEY: ...elaborate trips?
>> KHLOE: I thought it was a guy

22:39.100 --> 22:41.233
you're dating.
Why would we assume something

22:41.233 --> 22:43.433
unless we hear it from you?
You can't just assume people

22:43.433 --> 22:45.300
know.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

22:45.300 --> 22:48.166
>> KHLOE: Kourtney definitely
does things in her own time

22:48.166 --> 22:51.900
whenever she feels comfortable,
but I am proud of Kourtney for

22:51.900 --> 22:54.433
finally opening up to Scott
about her current relationship

22:54.433 --> 22:56.600
status.
I'm just happy that there's,

22:56.600 --> 22:59.767
like, motion moving forward for
her.

22:59.767 --> 23:02.800
What can I do to get rid of
varicose veins?

23:02.800 --> 23:06.033
>> KOURTNEY: I don't know.
Where do you have 'em?

23:06.033 --> 23:10.033
>> KHLOE: Here.
>> KOURTNEY: You have to ask.

23:10.033 --> 23:12.266
Like, I think you can laser
them.

23:12.266 --> 23:14.900
>> KHLOE: Yeah, Mom said I
inject them with saline.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.500
>> KOURTNEY: That sounds
hurtful.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.367
>> KHLOE: She goes, "It's so
painful."

23:18.367 --> 23:21.500
With a smile on her face.
I was like...  "Okay."

23:21.500 --> 23:23.400
Weirdo.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.767
This is Dean.
>> KRIS: Hey, Dean.

23:38.767 --> 23:42.367
I'm just, actually, on your
website looking what you have

23:42.367 --> 23:45.567
going on here, and it's kind of
fascinating.

23:45.567 --> 23:49.633
Can you walk me through, just
quickly, you know, in general,

23:49.633 --> 23:53.700
what the process is once someone
passes away?

23:53.700 --> 23:56.967
>> DEAN: Typically, uh, when
someone calls us, we actually

23:56.967 --> 24:01.166
send out a kit that, uh, holds
the amount of remains that we

24:01.166 --> 24:04.400
use for the process.
So, we heat those remains up to

24:04.400 --> 24:08.100
about 3,000 degrees centigrade.
Basically, what that does is it

24:08.100 --> 24:11.967
leaves us with the pure carbon
and then that goes into, uh, one

24:11.967 --> 24:14.200
of our diamond presses.
>> KRIS: But if I wanted to do,

24:14.200 --> 24:18.834
like, a diamond and I needed six
diamonds, I could probably get

24:18.834 --> 24:21.867
six diamonds out of one body.
>> DEAN: Oh, yeah, yep.

24:21.867 --> 24:24.633
That would not be a problem.
>> KRIS: Interesting.

24:24.633 --> 24:28.400
Dean, this has been so helpful.
I really appreciate you getting

24:28.400 --> 24:30.667
on the phone with me.
I'm gonna have a little chat

24:30.667 --> 24:33.300
with my kids.
Uh, we'll contact you and tell

24:33.300 --> 24:35.300
you kind of like what we're
gonna do.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.633
>> DEAN: All right.
You're very welcome, Kris.

24:36.633 --> 24:38.033
>> KRIS: Okay.
>> DEAN: Thank you for calling.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.734
>> KRIS: All right, you got it.
Bye-bye.

24:39.734 --> 24:43.967
>> DEAN: Okay, yep. Bye-bye.
>> KRIS: Maybe you should gain

24:43.967 --> 24:51.200
some weight right before you die
and then we can make more.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.400

is certified for authenticity."

24:58.433 --> 25:00.567

I could turn your body into that

25:00.567 --> 25:02.667
Asscher cut diamond.
>> KRIS:  Yes.

25:02.667 --> 25:04.467
>> KIM: Come with me.
>> KRIS:  Well, you got

25:04.467 --> 25:06.100
to wait till I die first.

25:08.200 --> 25:12.900
and take your remains and get
them mixed up with other

25:12.900 --> 25:14.867
remains?
>> KIM: That is so weird.

25:14.867 --> 25:17.600
>> KRIS: Or lose you in the
mail?

25:17.600 --> 25:20.567
All this information is like a
buzzkill.

25:20.567 --> 25:24.567
I just, I can't wrap my head
around all the technical stuff

25:24.567 --> 25:28.166

I appreciate it, for sure.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.533
There are just so many options
with this death diamond process

25:31.533 --> 25:35.467
that I don't know what to do,
because I have so many kids, and

25:35.467 --> 25:38.300
it's just getting ridiculous.
>> KIM: I just don't get it.

25:38.300 --> 25:41.934
I don't get how you can turn a
body into a diamond.

25:41.934 --> 25:45.800
People would be killing people
and taking their bodies and

25:45.800 --> 25:50.533
making it into diamonds and
selling it.

25:50.533 --> 25:53.834

business because you're very

25:53.834 --> 25:55.734
entrepreneurial.

38:23.333 --> 38:26.200
room shot, obviously, we...
the... it's quite plain in here.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.867
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.
>> MARTYN: So we need to kind

38:27.867 --> 38:29.400
of amp it up a little bit.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.367
>> MARTYN: Do we have any
colored glasses?

38:31.367 --> 38:33.367
I know we've got all those
Riedel crystal ones, but have we

38:33.367 --> 38:34.867
got any colored ones?
>> KOURTNEY: No.

38:34.867 --> 38:37.367
>> MARTYN: How fun it would be
to kind of do some colored ones?

38:37.367 --> 38:39.367
>> KOURTNEY: That's going on my
Christmas list.

38:39.367 --> 38:41.734
>> MARTYN: We need a little...

38:41.734 --> 38:46.467
>> KOURTNEY: Martyn Lawrence
Bullard is a friend and an

38:46.467 --> 38:50.500
amazing interior designer.
And we are shooting my home

38:50.500 --> 38:53.867
today for an interior design
magazine.

38:53.867 --> 38:56.533
I have these, okay?

38:56.533 --> 38:58.633
I love to bounce ideas off of
him.

38:58.633 --> 39:03.300
He's just very inspiring and
motivating, and just always has

39:03.300 --> 39:06.867
great ideas.
So, I wanted to pick your brain,

39:06.867 --> 39:10.367
'cause I feel like my sisters
keep putting all this pressure

39:10.367 --> 39:11.533
on me.
>> MARTYN: Let's sit down,

39:11.533 --> 39:12.700
please.
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.233
>> MARTYN: It's, it's a proper
conversation.

39:15.233 --> 39:18.967
>> KOURTNEY: Um, so, my sisters,
you know, they keep, like,

39:18.967 --> 39:21.300
saying, "Well, what's your
passion, what are you gonna do?"

39:21.300 --> 39:24.900
And I finally feel, like, at the
place where I could take

39:24.900 --> 39:27.233
something else on.
>> MARTYN: I mean, I... having

39:27.233 --> 39:30.700
worked with you for the last
couple years, and, you know, I

39:30.700 --> 39:34.433
love you, and I think you've got
an unbelievable talent inside of

39:34.433 --> 39:37.900
you for design, and I've seen
you learn.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.467
You know, I just tell you one
thing, and you go off and learn

39:40.467 --> 39:43.200
the whole book.
But I feel that... I feel that

39:43.200 --> 39:46.767
first and foremost, it's an
amazing blessing to be a

39:46.767 --> 39:49.800
Kardashian, and it's a really
difficult situation, too,

39:49.800 --> 39:52.533
because whatever you do to go
into any field, people are

39:52.533 --> 39:54.200
gonna want to put you down
immediately.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.200
So you need to really find a
specialized area you want to get

39:58.200 --> 39:59.734
into.
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

39:59.734 --> 40:02.000
>> MARTYN: Maybe put together
some samples, or put together

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
some storyboards.
You know, like we did for

40:04.000 --> 40:05.500
your house?
>> KOURTNEY: Mm-hmm.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.367
>> MARTYN: Of images, of looks,
of things, that you can take and

40:09.367 --> 40:12.000
then present.
If you go in with those ideas--

40:12.000 --> 40:15.367
and you have those ideas, 'cause
you tell them to me-- I feel

40:15.367 --> 40:19.200
like you can transition that and
really kind of carve your niche.

40:19.200 --> 40:21.233
You could be amazing.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

40:21.233 --> 40:24.367
>> MARTYN: I can happily help
introduce you to some of...

40:24.367 --> 40:27.300
even some of my licensees, some
of the things that I've got

40:27.300 --> 40:30.600
coming out and doing now.
'Cause I have eight new lines

40:30.600 --> 40:32.433
going out in the next...
>> KOURTNEY: That's amazing.

40:32.433 --> 40:35.867
>> MARTYN: ...seven months.
>> KOURTNEY: I'm realizing that

40:35.867 --> 40:40.567
I don't need my sisters'
permission, ideas or feedback to

40:40.567 --> 40:45.734
do my own thing.
Everybody finds their path at

40:45.734 --> 40:48.867
different times.
Whether it's interior design or

40:48.867 --> 40:51.300
something else.
I'm just at a place right now in

40:51.300 --> 40:53.934

relationships where I feel like

40:53.934 --> 40:58.166
I need to take charge and really
live life for myself and for my

40:58.166 --> 41:01.300
