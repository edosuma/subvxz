00:13.274 --> 00:16.451
FXX presentsYou're the Worst.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.332
Faster, Jimbo.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.726
That's not helping.
Talk hot.

00:30.769 --> 00:34.251
-Oh, my feet are so sweaty.
-There you go.

00:34.295 --> 00:36.688
Oh, I can't wait
to take my shoes off,

00:36.732 --> 00:38.081
stretch my toes apart.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.170
-Oh, yeah, keep going.
-Flex my arches

00:40.214 --> 00:42.999
back and forth, back and forth.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.435
Ooh!

00:44.479 --> 00:45.654
Oh, yeah.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.308
Give 'em a little soak.

00:47.351 --> 00:50.093
Oh, boy, they're so wriggly!

00:54.402 --> 00:55.490
Hut!

01:06.718 --> 01:08.372
3:44!

01:08.416 --> 01:10.113
-Ah!
-I think I have the bends.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.941
We broke our record.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.465
Jimmy, we could medal
in speed fucking.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.380
Yeah, or we could just wait
until after the reception.

01:16.424 --> 01:19.035
-Like people.
-Open bar, bro.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.558
We'll be way too
schnozzled by then.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.604
-Huh.
-And you have to bang

01:22.647 --> 01:23.692
on your wedding night.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.389
Like how
if you break a mirror,

01:25.433 --> 01:27.130
your grandmother's ghost
sees you masturbate.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.525
Uh...

01:30.568 --> 01:34.398
Can I answer any questions
about the venue?

01:34.442 --> 01:38.141
Did the Goodwin sisters
really get murdered here?

01:38.185 --> 01:41.492
Yeah. They were garroted
in the main hall.

01:41.536 --> 01:43.146
All three of them?

01:45.975 --> 01:48.586
Yeah, if you could just
give us a moment to discuss...

01:48.630 --> 01:49.631
We'll take it.
Take our money.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.328
Just take all our money!

01:51.372 --> 01:52.764
Okay, then.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.505
Uh, here's the schedule of fees.

01:54.549 --> 01:58.422
Just read and sign
at the bottom.

01:58.466 --> 02:00.859
I need someone to air out
the east annex

02:00.903 --> 02:02.774
and buy new towels.

02:02.818 --> 02:04.950
Uh, is this a prank?

02:04.994 --> 02:07.605
This can't be the price
for a single event.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.825
Just put it on a credit card.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.654
Here.
Oop...

02:14.308 --> 02:15.831
How many credit cards
do you have?

02:15.874 --> 02:16.832
Like, 70.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.529
Seventy?!

02:18.573 --> 02:21.315
You're, like, 50/50
with flushing the toilet.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.405
How do you remember to pay off
70 credit cards each month?

02:24.448 --> 02:27.190
: You don't need
to pay off credit cards.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.105
When one stops working,
you just get another.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.891
Um, how much do you owe,

02:32.935 --> 02:35.285
like, in total?

02:35.329 --> 02:36.852
Who cares?
It's not real.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.767
It's just some numbers
on a computer somewhere.

02:38.810 --> 02:41.073
Why have you never told me
of your debt before?!

02:41.117 --> 02:43.250
Honey, it's ourdebt now.

02:43.293 --> 02:46.383
Oh, my God, I'm marrying
an actual child.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.863
Not even a skilled one.

02:47.906 --> 02:48.907
Just because we have
different ideas

02:48.951 --> 02:50.300
about personal finance
doesn't mean

02:50.344 --> 02:51.432
you get to patronize me.

02:51.475 --> 02:53.347
It does if I'm
your literal patron.

02:53.390 --> 02:56.480
Just lock down
the venue already.

02:56.524 --> 03:00.223
Ugh, I have to go hire
my replacement.

03:00.267 --> 03:01.572
I'm gonna make these twats

03:03.357 --> 03:06.360
Well, since that will surely
lead to your firing,

03:06.403 --> 03:08.884
I will whore myself out
to Hollywood for the both of us.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.887
Why, because you're the man?

It was a tumor, and an important

Dutch is doing well.

He's pitching,
he's contributing.

I'm the one too intimidated
to even open my mouth.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.605
Yikes. I hope it's not me.

05:01.649 --> 05:05.348
Oh, no, no. Uh...

05:05.392 --> 05:08.917
My ex-partner made me question
my abilities as a writer.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.484
Not to mention encouraged me

05:10.527 --> 05:12.137

Well, that sounds just terrible.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.671
Yeah, well, I've come
to the realization

09:01.715 --> 09:04.935
that there is some value
in experiencing the same story

09:04.979 --> 09:07.851
in a secondary, inferior medium.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.592
Like when you roast

09:51.460 --> 09:54.028
So...

why do you want
to be a publicist?

09:58.902 --> 10:01.296
Actually, you made me
want to do this.

10:01.339 --> 10:03.820

-It's an honor to send you home.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.873
Our La Croix budget won't
cover you. You're too thirsty.

Bam! You got Cutlered!

10:18.748 --> 10:20.141
Mm-mm.

10:20.184 --> 10:22.883
PR isn't just about
learning celeb secrets

10:22.926 --> 10:25.494
and stealing retinol creams
from their swag bags.

10:25.537 --> 10:27.061
It's about power.

10:27.104 --> 10:29.672
Power over celebs
and the shit they don't need,

10:29.716 --> 10:33.197
like retinol creams.

Surviving the next elimination
will be much harder

-Uh, no.

This is obviously a test.
It's, like, 1:30.

10:55.219 --> 10:59.746
You're right. It is a test,
and you failed. Ciao, suck-butt.

11:21.376 --> 11:22.856
at his uncle's knee.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.988
But before he can
reckon with this,

11:25.032 --> 11:25.946
he finds himself

11:25.989 --> 11:27.599
in Primrose Hill,

11:27.643 --> 11:30.733
its gentle swells reminding him

11:30.777 --> 11:34.911
he has someone for whom
to survive this night-- Kitty.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.827
-Oh.
-Mm. Love Kitty.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.003
She's an incredible character.
Charming.

11:40.047 --> 11:42.179
-Raw. Love.
-It's her movie, really.

11:42.223 --> 11:43.964
Kitty's?

11:44.007 --> 11:46.618
She's really the perfect
protagonist for today's climate.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.620
Everyone is gonna
want to be Kitty.

11:48.664 --> 11:51.101
-Or bang Kitty.
-Consensually.

11:51.145 --> 11:53.016
Obviously consensually.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.975
-Jesus, Sheila.
-Sure.

11:55.018 --> 11:58.805
But to be clear,
Simon is the protagonist, so...

11:58.848 --> 12:00.371
Simon's running

12:00.415 --> 12:02.243
from the hooligans
from his past.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.332
I mean, certainly
we can all agree

12:04.375 --> 12:07.683
that Kitty is a reprehensible
character, right?

12:07.727 --> 12:11.252
She's immature, squalid,
untrustworthy.

12:11.295 --> 12:14.342
That's what we love about Kitty.
Her messiness is aspirational.

12:14.385 --> 12:18.999
What is? Her utter reliance
on everyone around her?

12:19.042 --> 12:22.567
Or the way that she bankrupts
her father's cobbler shop?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.352
I'm starting to feel
like you're not Team Kitty.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.006
I hate Kitty!

12:26.049 --> 12:27.790
Oh, what he means is that
he hates Kitty

12:27.834 --> 12:30.184
because he hates himself.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.273
Wrong! Love myself.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.275
-Hate Kitty.
-Exactly.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.190
It's why no one else
could write Kitty.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.278
And it's that same

12:37.321 --> 12:40.150
kind of hatred
that binds Kitty to Simon.

12:40.194 --> 12:43.719
And Jimmy to them both,
who are both... well, him.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.242
Jimmy.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.983
-Huh.
-Hmm.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.951
It's the garter belt.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.170
Goddamn it, Rachel,
I told you to just stand there

13:00.214 --> 13:04.696
and be quiet.
I know it's the garter belt.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.915
Point to where you think it is.

13:08.222 --> 13:09.876
Yeah, that's where
I thought it was.

13:11.355 --> 13:14.968
Nice, Rachel.
You passed the test.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.099
Wait, so you wanted our help?

13:16.143 --> 13:18.449
Shut up!
Half of PR involves

13:18.493 --> 13:20.016
sitting silently
next to your client,

13:20.060 --> 13:22.192
who will be annoyed
by the very fact of you,

13:22.236 --> 13:24.194
like how you breathe
too hard, Rachel.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.848
No one here is named Rachel.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.241
Bad news.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.721
Turns out my big corporate boss

13:29.765 --> 13:32.115
isn't actually a boss at all.

13:32.159 --> 13:34.422
-He really is a janitor.
-Linds.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.641
Did you think the janitor
was an undercover boss?

13:36.685 --> 13:39.993
One of these times he has to be
an undercover boss. It's math.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.299
Can I set your purse down?
It's heavy.

13:42.343 --> 13:45.128
No. Most of PR is carrying
other people's shit around.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.087
Why are these basic hos here?

13:47.130 --> 13:48.784
I am being thorough.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.743
Goldman Sachs has
a ten-step interview process.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.571
Oh, does Old Man Sachs
have all those steps

13:53.615 --> 13:55.356
to avoid calling his mom, too?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.575
All right, bitches.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.751
New test. In PR,

13:59.795 --> 14:02.015
you are often asked to pull tail
for your client.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.278
Find Lindsay someone at this bar
she can bang

14:04.321 --> 14:07.150
and realistically
fall in love with.

14:07.194 --> 14:09.065
-But we don't know her.
-Go!

14:11.589 --> 14:14.766
And while they find someone
who makes my heart horny,

14:14.810 --> 14:15.942
let's practice calling your mom.

14:15.985 --> 14:19.162
No!

14:19.206 --> 14:23.166
Ring, ring, ring.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.387
-Hi, Mom.
-Hello, Gretchen.

14:26.430 --> 14:29.390
Your father and I were just
complaining about you.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
Hi, Mommy.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.133
Is there a reason you called?

14:33.176 --> 14:35.091
Jimmy and I are getting married.

14:35.135 --> 14:38.138
Well, I'm obviously aghast,

14:38.181 --> 14:41.184
but someone whose sell-by date
has long since passed

14:41.228 --> 14:42.969
might as well grab
the first immigrant

14:43.012 --> 14:44.187
who needs a green card.

14:44.231 --> 14:46.973
Jimmy loves me
and he already has a green card.

14:47.016 --> 14:49.279
-I think.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.847
Do it now so your face settles
before June.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.284
And only eat steamed fish
and veggies.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.112
-Mommy, I don't want to...
-Fine!

14:56.156 --> 14:59.594
Gallumph down the aisle a fat,
wrinkled pig for all I care.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.639
-I didn't say that!
-Have you just grown

15:01.683 --> 15:03.598
so comfortable with failure

15:03.641 --> 15:05.078
that you don't even
notice it anymore?

15:05.121 --> 15:07.384
Like how people who have
litter boxes in their house

15:07.428 --> 15:09.430
get used to the smell
of cat shit?

15:09.473 --> 15:10.779
What? No.

15:10.822 --> 15:12.824
At least you'll be
his burden now.

15:12.868 --> 15:14.174
-I hate you! I hate you!
-You've been nothing...

15:14.217 --> 15:15.827
-I hate you!
-...but dead weight since

15:15.871 --> 15:17.655
the day they cut you
out of my uterus!

15:17.699 --> 15:19.353
Lindsay!

15:19.396 --> 15:21.877
Oh, that's right,
run to the bottle.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.880
I hung up on you.
You can't see what I'm doing.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.623
Ugh. Time!
Bring it in, bitches!

15:30.277 --> 15:32.844
You didn't specify a time limit.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.063
Oh, well, you're Cutlered.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.240
No?
-Mm.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.851
All right, Linds.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.636
Which guy?

15:41.679 --> 15:43.551
Neither. This is who they pick?

15:43.594 --> 15:45.901
A wizard

15:45.945 --> 15:48.208
Hard pass.

15:48.251 --> 15:49.600
You're both Cutlered!

15:49.644 --> 15:52.560
Oh, it works.
You just have to attack it.

15:52.603 --> 15:55.389
Thanks for no help
with that, dummies.

15:55.432 --> 15:59.001
Call your mom. Do it.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.579
Um, just wondering how much
longer the interview is?

16:11.622 --> 16:14.669
Oh, the real interview
hasn't even started yet.

16:14.712 --> 16:16.932
Lightning round.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.717
Let's Coyote Uglythis bitch!

16:19.761 --> 16:22.546
♪

16:31.120 --> 16:33.122
♪

16:43.306 --> 16:45.004
♪

16:54.143 --> 16:55.753
MAN:
I'm gonna kill you!

17:03.718 --> 17:05.589
Get her!

17:10.290 --> 17:13.206
Should we just go?

17:13.249 --> 17:15.121
Is that what they taught you
at Mount Holyoke

17:15.164 --> 17:16.252
You know where I went to school?

17:16.296 --> 17:18.254
I know about all of you--

17:18.298 --> 17:21.475
about Thirsty's internship
at Dentsu.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.564
About how No Drinks
went to Duke.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.566
I know all about
your special skills

17:25.609 --> 17:27.307
and all the languages you speak,

17:27.350 --> 17:30.527
and all the hobbies you think
make you sound interesting.

17:30.571 --> 17:33.878
Bouldering.
Indoor cycling.

17:33.922 --> 17:37.099
Who stays in Girl Scouts
through high school, Debbie?

17:37.143 --> 17:39.536
Don't listen to her.
She's a psychopath.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.756
So all of this was
part of the interview?

17:41.799 --> 17:43.366
The singing, the fighting,

17:43.410 --> 17:44.672
the making out
with the random guy?

17:44.715 --> 17:47.370
Yes! Wait, that was a guy?

17:47.414 --> 17:50.591
Oh, goddamn it,
he had such soft lips.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.247
Your clients
will be terrible people

17:54.290 --> 17:55.770
with no impulse control.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.338
Musicians are babies
who will shit all over you

17:58.381 --> 17:59.904
and laugh about it.

17:59.948 --> 18:01.297
So you're not actually drunk?

18:01.341 --> 18:05.345
I am completely sober.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.565
Fooled you, Rachel.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.960
:
Cutlered.

18:19.620 --> 18:21.839
What a sham.
They trick me

18:21.883 --> 18:25.365
into describing
how to adapt my work

18:25.408 --> 18:28.498
just so they can pass my clear
roadmap along to some hack

18:28.542 --> 18:31.501
who will strip away
all the heady eroticism

18:31.545 --> 18:34.939
and write a film about
a quirky girl named Kitty.

18:34.983 --> 18:36.332
You don't know
that you didn't get the job.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.814
They said "Good stuff,"
at the end.

18:39.857 --> 18:41.729
You think someone who'd been
rejected as often as you

18:41.772 --> 18:43.383
-would recognize
when it happens.

18:43.426 --> 18:46.995
Oh, crap. I have to go in
for a late-night writing sesh.

18:47.038 --> 18:51.217
Hey, did I tell you I'm under
Paul F. Tompkins's wing now?

18:51.260 --> 18:52.435
Well, at least you know where

18:52.479 --> 18:53.654
your next paycheck's
coming from.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.351
God knows when the first payment

18:55.395 --> 18:58.833
for my next book comes in,
or the royalties on Width.

18:58.876 --> 19:01.836
And whilst I wait, I'll have
to default on my mortgage,

19:01.879 --> 19:04.186
sell my resplendent hot rod...

19:04.230 --> 19:05.274
I don't think it's been
street legal

19:05.318 --> 19:06.667
since Gretchen set it on fire.

19:06.710 --> 19:09.452
And then marry that self-same
pyromaniacal redhead

19:09.496 --> 19:11.237
somewhere cheap and disgusting,

19:11.280 --> 19:15.241
like Reno
or some botanical garden.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.243
I still think
you're gonna get it.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.636
If they were to give me the job,
it would probably

19:19.680 --> 19:22.900
only be because of your
offensive yet succinct

19:22.944 --> 19:27.296
oversimplification
of my sweeping epic.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.037
Thanks.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.959
Yes.

19:41.310 --> 19:44.313
All right. Fine.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.492
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

19:49.536 --> 19:52.365
-I got it.
Seriously?

19:52.408 --> 19:54.715
-That's amazing.

19:54.758 --> 19:56.020
You don't have
to worry about money.

19:56.064 --> 19:57.761
I have to write a screenplay.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.027
That's good.

20:03.071 --> 20:05.334
Remember your soup metaphor?

20:05.378 --> 20:07.597
Soup? Soup isn't food.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.905
It's just bone water.
Seriously, Edgar.

20:10.948 --> 20:13.429
All you had to do
was just sit there

20:13.473 --> 20:16.215
and keep your mouth shut.

20:25.398 --> 20:26.964
Aw, shit.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.097
Oh, did we bang?

20:29.140 --> 20:32.143
How was it?
Did I do anything weird?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.409
What happened to Rachel?

20:36.452 --> 20:37.453
She had to feed her cat.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.767
Did you do all this?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.769
I like to stay busy.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.511
I think I figured out
what the last test is.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.774
Are you really afraid
of what your mom

20:53.817 --> 20:55.341
will think
about you getting married,

20:55.384 --> 20:58.082
or are you actually afraid
of what you think?

20:58.126 --> 20:59.345
You don't know my mother.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.129
She withheld food, human touch

21:01.172 --> 21:03.566
and Breyer model horses
to control me.

21:03.610 --> 21:04.959
After seeing what you put
yourself through today,

21:05.002 --> 21:06.526
I think you can handle it.

21:06.569 --> 21:08.136
Whatever she says.

21:14.360 --> 21:18.581
Hi. Sorry it's so late. I...

21:19.930 --> 21:22.759
Mommy, I have some big news.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.548
DOUG:
What if we switch it up

21:28.591 --> 21:30.680
and make her the doctor?

21:30.724 --> 21:33.509
Yes. I love male nurses.

21:33.553 --> 21:36.469
But I hate how they never
ask doctors for directions.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.821
Yeah, they're real
Florence Nightinmales.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.477
There's our title.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.479
Where has this
Edgar been hiding?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.611
-Right here.
-DUTCH:
You got to sing out more, man.

21:48.655 --> 21:51.571
I don't think we're gonna
be able to top that.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.008
Hey, Edgar, you want to take
the rest of the sandwiches home?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.749
Oh, man, my roommates
don't like when I take up

21:55.792 --> 21:57.490
too much of the fridge.

21:57.533 --> 22:02.364
Oh, man. I... I really hate
to see food get wasted.

22:02.408 --> 22:03.800
Edgar, I tell you what.

22:03.844 --> 22:07.500
I'll pay you a thousand dollars

22:07.543 --> 22:10.285
to eat the rest of these
sandwiches right now.

22:11.591 --> 22:14.202
What do you say?

22:23.254 --> 22:25.735
Hell yeah, Edgar. You got this.

22:25.779 --> 22:28.477
I love watching people eat food.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.261
Now the minute you feel sick or
even a little bit uncomfortable,

22:30.305 --> 22:32.786
you can stop, we won't
think any less of you.

22:36.137 --> 22:38.444
Sandwich number one.

22:40.489 --> 22:44.188
So...

22:44.232 --> 22:45.755
did you find a new you?

22:45.799 --> 22:48.105
Nah. None of them
really stood out.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.629
But Lindsay pulled a Lindsay

22:49.672 --> 22:52.501
and boned a janitor,
so I'm gonna hire her.

22:52.545 --> 22:55.199
She's feeling pretty low.
What'd you do today?

22:55.243 --> 22:59.465
Eh, nothing. Just became
a professional screenwriter.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.337
And locked down
our wedding venue.

23:04.034 --> 23:07.429
You whored yourself out for us.

23:07.473 --> 23:08.909
Aw.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.911
I'm so lucky.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.913
I can't wait to marry you.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.567
I love you so much.

23:14.610 --> 23:17.657
You've been mixing
off-brand cough syrups again.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.312
No, Jimmy.
I called my mom.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.489
-Oh, boy.
-No, it was good.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.708
It was, like, really good.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.928
We've never had
a conversation like that.

23:27.971 --> 23:32.933
We laughed, we bonded, she told
me about her menopausal dryness.

23:32.976 --> 23:34.717
I even told her
about the wedding.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.676
She didn't say anything shitty.

23:36.719 --> 23:39.548
She was just happy for me.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.941
Seriously

23:40.984 --> 23:42.508
She didn't trick you
into having the wedding

23:42.551 --> 23:44.248
in Missouri or anything?

23:44.292 --> 23:45.728
Nope.

23:45.772 --> 23:47.730
Aw.

23:47.774 --> 23:50.298
Well, I'm proud of you
for calling your parents.

23:50.341 --> 23:53.562
That was shockingly mature
of you.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.346
-Thank you.
-Hmm.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.609
They think I'm marrying Boone.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.959
-And there it is.
-Good night.
