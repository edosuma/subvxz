00:01.025 --> 00:04.042
- What are the guns for, then?
- For gotcha, the Omega Chis'

00:04.167 --> 00:05.409
campus assassin game.

00:05.534 --> 00:08.301
The object of the game is to
eliminate your assigned target.

00:08.426 --> 00:10.328
Didn't break your purity pledge?

00:10.512 --> 00:12.844
- Nope. Aren't you proud?
- I had sex with Sheila.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.860
I saw Rebecca having
a lot of fun last night.

00:15.985 --> 00:16.928
With who?

00:17.053 --> 00:19.757
It was hard to tell,
given his face was in her mouth.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.556
- Who's the mystery man?
- You're a good kisser.

00:24.724 --> 00:26.043
What are we doing?

00:26.290 --> 00:29.944
Without extra credit, D on my midterm,
which is 20 percent of our grade...

00:30.948 --> 00:33.948
... my average is still a low C.
Max told me everything.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.201
You admitted you weren't over Casey.

00:36.326 --> 00:40.268
Stop. Cappie and I aren't
getting together. Are we?

It's so quiet in here.

00:58.685 --> 01:01.059
<i>Quiet please Spitter's study zone</i>

01:01.862 --> 01:03.095
Sorry.

01:08.076 --> 01:10.379
They're making sure
I get my studying done.

01:10.653 --> 01:11.920
Totally silent charades.

01:12.045 --> 01:13.454
They've been playing for hours.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.826
Must be nice to have that kind
of leisure time, am I right?

01:17.028 --> 01:19.677
Between my guitar hero tournaments,
tennis lessons,

01:19.802 --> 01:22.326
drinking, gardening,
I am booked solid, spitter.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.257
- Is that tea?
- Boo Berry bana blast punch.

01:25.382 --> 01:27.828
- I warmed it up.
- And you're reading jodi picoult?

01:29.214 --> 01:32.163
It's for booktacular:
the book club dale and I started.

01:32.288 --> 01:34.384
We're meeting tomorrow
and I'm halfway through.

01:34.725 --> 01:36.955
The one daughter needs
the other daughter's kidney.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.864
- It's a big dilemma. Lot of angst.
- Sounds like you and my sister.

01:39.989 --> 01:42.575
Far as I know, Casey
and I both have two working Kidneys.

01:42.812 --> 01:43.977
No, I mean the angst.

01:44.499 --> 01:46.184
No angst on my end.
Why would there be?

01:46.357 --> 01:48.557
Yeah, I guess you turned her down.

01:49.268 --> 01:50.558
How's she doing?

01:50.683 --> 01:53.232
Busy getting ready for ZBZ
father/daughter weekend.

01:57.390 --> 01:58.708
"Get your grill on."

01:59.662 --> 02:00.703
Jordan invited me.

02:00.962 --> 02:02.666
She wants me to meet her dad.

02:02.964 --> 02:04.689
Already.
I mean,

02:05.376 --> 02:07.760
we haven't even, you know...

02:15.055 --> 02:16.918
- The dad? Sorry about that.
- <i>Doin it!</i>

02:17.043 --> 02:20.076
Why? She said he's really nice.
Just a regular guy.

02:20.511 --> 02:22.143
I'm supposed to call him Jack.

02:22.605 --> 02:25.059
- It's gonna be great.
- It's gonna be awkward at best.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.653
At worst, there's gonna be a heated
argument, culminating in a standoff,

02:28.778 --> 02:31.214
gunfire and one or more people
are gonna lose a Kidney.

02:31.526 --> 02:34.635
Or I've just been reading
too much Jodi Picoult.

02:34.895 --> 02:36.571
Never mind. It'll be fine, OK?

02:36.741 --> 02:39.407
What father wouldn't be thrilled
to have you date his daughter?

02:44.353 --> 02:46.073
<i>He's screwed.</i>

02:46.353 --> 02:47.373
I know!

02:57.895 --> 03:00.514
- Gotcha!
- I hate this game!

03:00.799 --> 03:02.179
Sorry, Laura.

03:05.626 --> 03:08.008
How do we explain that she's
not in the sority anymore?

03:08.133 --> 03:10.684
It's beth. I couldn't explain
daylight savings time to her.

03:10.809 --> 03:12.313
It's easier to let her stay.

03:12.438 --> 03:14.695
What if her dad shows up
for father/daughter weekend?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.790
Last thing we need is another dad.
Every year,

03:16.915 --> 03:19.571
all the dads care about
is the flag football game.

03:19.742 --> 03:23.159
You think they were at NFL fantasy camp
instead of playing against frat guys.

03:23.284 --> 03:25.829
Not just any frat guys.
The best athletes on the row.

03:25.999 --> 03:29.874
Calvin's playing this year, so I made
banners for both him and my dad.

03:31.315 --> 03:33.379
- You're weird, Ash.
- Why? 'cause I like my dad?

03:33.548 --> 03:35.705
Because you text your dad every day.

03:35.849 --> 03:38.903
You asked him to be
your Facebook friend. That's weird.

03:39.097 --> 03:42.721
My dad hasn't talked to me about anything
except the weather since I got boobs.

03:43.061 --> 03:46.723
With my dad, infidelity with hookers
is always a conversational option.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.943
- Can't wait!
- That sucks.

03:49.068 --> 03:51.896
He did just finish a two-week
intensive therapy retreat.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.629
With colonic cleanse.

03:54.082 --> 03:55.425
He claims he's a changed man.

03:56.011 --> 03:58.486
This is all so sad!
I tell my dad everything.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.073
He knew about me and fisher
hooking up before you guys did.

04:01.425 --> 04:03.533
And I told him about you and Evan.

04:03.783 --> 04:04.966
Yeah, Evan.

04:05.163 --> 04:07.416
You know,
there are other guys on this campus.

04:08.625 --> 04:12.250
Relax. It's not like you kissed
someone else's boyfriend this time.

04:13.129 --> 04:15.992
But I have to ask,
how the hell did that Even happen?

04:16.428 --> 04:18.714
The usual way. Tequila shots.
You know how it is.

04:18.885 --> 04:20.372
What do you mean?
Evan hasn't

04:20.497 --> 04:23.292
touched tequila since the human PI?
That mixer sophomore year.

04:23.417 --> 04:26.733
I mean, I did too many
shots and kissed him.

04:26.858 --> 04:28.512
I thought you said he kissed you.

04:28.637 --> 04:30.271
That's what I meant.

04:30.396 --> 04:33.315
So why are you so nervous, Rebecca?

04:33.728 --> 04:36.858
Not nervous. In a hurry.
Study session later.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.057
Hey, Fisher, looks like Rebecca
wants seconds of that sausage.

04:42.193 --> 04:44.574
She can't seem to cram it
in her mouth fast enough.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.212
Sorry about that.

05:00.751 --> 05:02.013
Oh, my god!

05:04.824 --> 05:07.419
Yum, Spicy sausage!

05:20.186 --> 05:22.661
VO By: ¤Aka¤, flolo, Jujuleder

05:30.053 --> 05:32.502
Fisher, can I talk to you for a sec?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.791
Yeah, sure.
I'm kind of busy right now, but...

05:36.916 --> 05:39.678
- It's just...
- Hi, guys! What's going on?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.308
I just had a question for Fisher.

05:42.552 --> 05:44.031
Really?
What's the question?

05:44.156 --> 05:46.550
- Why do you care?
- I'm a curious person, Casey.

05:46.724 --> 05:49.121
So am i.
I'm curious

05:49.255 --> 05:52.350
if the two of you have something to
hide about the end of the world party.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.969
Something disgusting you
should be totally ashamed of?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.350
- Of course not.
- We just kissed, OK?

06:00.575 --> 06:03.138
{\pos(192,210)}I can't believe this. I can't believe
you would do this to Ashleigh.

06:03.322 --> 06:06.130
- It was a total accident.
- It'll never happen again.

06:06.255 --> 06:09.826
We were drunk, Rebecca kissed me,
and as soon as I realized, I stopped.

06:10.177 --> 06:11.718
Way to take responsibility.

06:11.855 --> 06:14.330
And you. After everything
that she's done for you?

06:17.019 --> 06:20.152
- I know.
- My god, I'm such a dumbass.

06:20.506 --> 06:22.266
Of course she'll never
forgive me for this.

06:22.417 --> 06:23.946
No, she won't.

06:24.456 --> 06:26.297
{\pos(192,210)}But I'm not going to tell her.

06:28.853 --> 06:29.898
You're not?

06:30.144 --> 06:31.889
I'm just picturing her face.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.183
{\pos(192,190)}She doesn't deserve
to feel that way.

06:34.616 --> 06:37.818
{\pos(192,210)}You guys are the ones
who deserve to live with this.

06:38.948 --> 06:41.399
{\pos(192,210)}All right. I'm gonna take you
at your word, just this once,

06:41.569 --> 06:45.020
{\pos(192,210)}that you love Ash
and this was a huge mistake.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.134
{\pos(192,210)}And I am going to assume
that you were drunk

06:48.259 --> 06:51.120
{\pos(192,210)}and didn't know what you were doing,
and you're not the horrible,

06:51.245 --> 06:53.861
{\pos(192,210)}backstabbing, conniving whorebag
this behavior would imply.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.664
You really expect me to believe
you're not gonna tell her?

06:57.230 --> 06:59.456
{\pos(192,210)}I guess you'll just
have to trust me.

07:09.813 --> 07:11.555
What's up with the jazzy ensemble?

07:11.891 --> 07:13.543
I could ask you the same thing.

07:13.668 --> 07:15.626
I got an important
meeting with my pastor.

07:15.751 --> 07:19.185
I have an important meeting with
one Mr. Jack reed, jordan's dad.

07:19.310 --> 07:21.294
I dressed up a little bit
so I don't get judged

07:21.419 --> 07:23.365
as some dumb frat guy.

07:23.490 --> 07:26.443
Sometimes it's good to be
judged as harshly as possible.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.336
Want to talk to me about something?

07:29.461 --> 07:30.913
No judgments.

07:31.202 --> 07:32.487
You know, don't you?

07:32.612 --> 07:33.982
What gave it away?

07:34.247 --> 07:36.111
Her slatternly perfume?

07:36.236 --> 07:38.331
I can't get it off my clothes.
Like she's marked me.

07:38.523 --> 07:40.310
No, you smell...

07:41.893 --> 07:44.288
The way you always smell.
Calvin told me.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.993
He's worried about you.

07:46.118 --> 07:48.481
- That losing your virginity...
- Don't say it!

07:48.801 --> 07:52.017
I'm sure I'm gonna
feel normal and pure again

07:52.142 --> 07:54.977
as soon as I talk it out
with pastor dan, so...

07:55.102 --> 07:57.231
Good luck with your judgment day.

08:13.815 --> 08:15.578
Hi! Dad!

08:15.703 --> 08:17.508
How was your flight?

08:17.633 --> 08:20.429
- It's good to see you.
- You too. You look great.

08:20.554 --> 08:22.826
I bet you know what
i'm gonna say now, right?

08:22.951 --> 08:25.481
- What's that?
- Tire pressure, case.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.597
Your right rear looks low.
Might want to take care of it.

08:28.722 --> 08:30.754
I'm just looking out for you.

08:30.879 --> 08:32.821
Yeah. So how's mom?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.662
Good. How's your brother?

08:35.787 --> 08:36.918
Good.

08:41.078 --> 08:44.981
I thought I'd drop you
back at your hotel.

08:45.220 --> 08:47.216
I have to finish
setting up for the barbecue.

08:47.341 --> 08:48.610
Sounds good.

08:49.126 --> 08:50.359
Good.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.991
When's the last time
you changed the oil?

09:03.116 --> 09:04.694
I just did.

09:04.819 --> 09:06.439
You can't forget.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.087
Do you know how important
adequate lubrication is?

09:11.983 --> 09:15.183
What I mean is, for instance,
in your mother's vul...

09:15.308 --> 09:16.438
Volvo...

09:19.430 --> 09:21.743
What if you broke down
in an unsavory neighborhood?

09:21.868 --> 09:24.884
- A pretty girl like you.
- I said I just got the oil changed.

09:25.009 --> 09:26.213
And I'm an adult,

09:26.338 --> 09:28.483
- I can take care of...
- Stop sign. Stop sign!

09:36.414 --> 09:38.109
Almost out of gas.

09:42.922 --> 09:44.357
Jammin'

09:44.482 --> 09:48.486
we jammin' with jesus, too
he jammin' with us

09:48.963 --> 09:51.128
we jammin' with him

09:51.428 --> 09:52.892
jammin'

09:53.017 --> 09:54.154
brother kettlewell!

09:54.279 --> 09:55.928
Are you here to jam for the lord?

09:56.294 --> 09:57.813
No, I didn't bring my guitar.

09:58.095 --> 09:59.974
I actually just, need

10:00.099 --> 10:01.933
to talk to you about... Sin.

10:02.339 --> 10:05.106
Jesus's specialty.
That's what he died for.

10:05.231 --> 10:06.621
No, I understand that.

10:06.746 --> 10:09.419
So if I sin
and ask for forgiveness...

10:09.544 --> 10:10.755
Then you're forgiven.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.903
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- But I had sex!

10:13.072 --> 10:15.739
With my landlady.
This is a woman I didn't love.

10:16.096 --> 10:18.496
- I didn't even really like her.
- Brother Kettlewell,

10:18.621 --> 10:21.637
the gospel according to John says
if we confess our sins,

10:21.762 --> 10:25.402
then he is faithful
and just to forgive us our sins,

10:25.527 --> 10:27.929
and to cleanse us
of all unrighteousness.

10:28.054 --> 10:29.729
Then how come
I still feel like hell?

10:29.854 --> 10:32.369
Brother Kettlewell,
jesus has done his part.

10:34.305 --> 10:37.768
So don't blame him
if you still feel bad

10:37.893 --> 10:39.660
come on, sing with me.

10:39.785 --> 10:41.426
We're jammin'

10:41.645 --> 10:44.016
we're jammin' with Jesus, too

10:46.178 --> 10:47.767
we'd like a taxi, please.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.143
Traveling in style, right?

10:50.747 --> 10:52.766
Or casey didn't want to pick us up.

10:53.276 --> 10:56.703
Dad, do you mind if I try out
a few conversation topics on you?

10:56.828 --> 10:58.707
I want to be prepared
for Jordan's dad.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.450
You're gonna be fine, Rus.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.082
Remember in high school,
your mother always used to say,

11:03.207 --> 11:06.231
"it's too bad Rusty doesn't
have a girlfriend or date..."

11:06.679 --> 11:09.918
'cause"any parent would be thrilled
to have him dating their daughter."

11:10.086 --> 11:12.400
Remember those friday
nights we all used to hang out?

11:12.525 --> 11:14.697
How we used to say,
"it's too bad Joan of Arcadia

11:14.822 --> 11:17.625
isn't a real girl,
'cause Joe Mantegna

11:17.750 --> 11:20.397
and Mary Steenburgen
would've really liked you."

11:20.522 --> 11:22.388
That makes me feel so much better.

11:22.610 --> 11:23.921
Cab for Jack Reed!

11:24.046 --> 11:25.513
Yeah. Jack reed here.

11:26.532 --> 11:27.849
Mr. Reed.

11:27.974 --> 11:31.440
- Yeah.
- I'm, Jordan's boyfriend, Rusty.

11:33.406 --> 11:35.607
Is that right?
How the heck are ya?

11:35.732 --> 11:37.787
- Call me Jack.
- This is my dad, Russell.

11:38.107 --> 11:41.707
Russell. Russell, Rusty.
Sensing a theme here.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.107
That's right!

11:43.232 --> 11:44.413
We try to make it easy.

11:45.247 --> 11:46.731
Why don't we share a cab over?

11:46.999 --> 11:48.082
- Great.
- Yeah.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.251
A little scrawny
for a cornerback, huh?

11:50.471 --> 11:52.115
Must make up for it in speed.

11:53.123 --> 11:54.123
Come on!

11:54.248 --> 11:55.654
Wait a minute.

11:55.779 --> 11:57.763
You have a girlfriend
and you're playing football?

11:57.888 --> 12:00.333
- That's my Rus.
- No. He thinks i'm her ex-boyfriend.

12:01.663 --> 12:03.078
Let's move it.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.829
I killed again last night.

12:06.094 --> 12:07.495
I hope you mean in the game.

12:07.620 --> 12:10.391
I feel bad because he thought
we were going on a date.

12:10.775 --> 12:12.396
But then I got him!

12:12.657 --> 12:14.710
Guess he shouldn't have trusted you.

12:17.135 --> 12:18.581
He didn't mind though.

12:18.706 --> 12:20.363
I let him touch my right boobie.

12:24.859 --> 12:26.900
Ash, I have to tell you something.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.541
You're probably gonna hate me,
and I wish I never did it,

12:29.791 --> 12:31.965
but I didn't kiss Evan
at the end of the world party.

12:32.445 --> 12:33.926
I kissed Fisher.

12:34.051 --> 12:35.051
What?

12:36.055 --> 12:37.797
That's not funny.
Is that a joke?

12:37.966 --> 12:39.145
I wish it were.

12:39.954 --> 12:42.142
- You kissed Fisher?
- I'm sorry, Ash.

12:42.267 --> 12:43.345
It was just a kiss.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.188
Oh, yeah, and one more thing:
Casey found out, but didn't tell.

12:46.313 --> 12:48.225
- She wanted to keep it a secret.
- What?

12:48.394 --> 12:49.499
- What?
- What?

12:50.702 --> 12:52.702
Where should I put these buns?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.203
Ashleigh! There's my girl!

12:59.736 --> 13:00.926
Dad.

13:25.466 --> 13:27.816
Ash, I can explain
this whole situation.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.170
Did you kiss her?

13:29.295 --> 13:31.152
Rebecca kissed me,
and I stopped her.

13:31.356 --> 13:33.697
- It will never happen again.
- Welcome to ZBZ.

13:33.822 --> 13:35.367
Never speak to me again.

13:36.381 --> 13:39.708
Ash, can I...? Will you
listen to me for one minute?

13:39.833 --> 13:42.194
Here they are, the bffs!

13:42.385 --> 13:44.305
Casey and Ashleigh!

13:44.430 --> 13:48.273
Senior year! What are you guys
gonna do without each other?

13:48.612 --> 13:52.067
Think you're gonna be roomies
out there in the big bad world?

13:52.192 --> 13:53.761
Oh, I'm not worried, dad.

13:53.959 --> 13:55.500
I can't wait for graduation.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.672
Omg, it's the bbf... Fs.

14:00.259 --> 14:02.174
It's like they've all
been readingtiger beat.

14:02.343 --> 14:03.558
Hey, dad.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.167
Hi, Mr. Cartwright.

14:05.455 --> 14:06.638
Hey, kid.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.338
Is that who I think it is?

14:10.558 --> 14:12.757
If you mean Fisher, nope.

14:13.501 --> 14:15.397
Come on, dad.
Let's go get some food.

14:20.098 --> 14:23.418
Sure is, clear out today.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.466
I have so much inside of me
that needs to come out.

14:30.829 --> 14:32.969
Wasn't that part of your
problem before, dad?

14:33.578 --> 14:36.698
I acknowledge that.
But the key is constant communication.

14:36.823 --> 14:38.635
That's what I learned on my retreat.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.664
Confessions of past wrongs
is the way to make current rights.

14:44.411 --> 14:46.312
Ash, can I talk to you for one...

14:46.437 --> 14:48.511
Get your hands off me.
Welcome, Mr. Logan.

14:53.158 --> 14:55.830
Are you having a fight
with your friend, becky?

14:55.955 --> 14:57.478
It's nothing I can't handle.

14:59.154 --> 15:00.689
As my art therapist said,

15:00.985 --> 15:03.484
"friends are the glue that
hold our hearts together."

15:04.384 --> 15:06.028
I had a best friend once.

15:06.343 --> 15:09.414
Then I lured him into a ponzi scheme

15:10.413 --> 15:13.662
that bankrupted him, and
then I slept with his wife.

15:15.193 --> 15:16.705
I was a bad man, becky.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.486
Your newfound self-awareness
is really annoying.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.233
I acknowledge that.

15:28.098 --> 15:29.712
This guy's a cavs fan.

15:31.351 --> 15:32.546
Great.

15:32.671 --> 15:34.298
First your dad thinks I'm andy,

15:34.423 --> 15:37.517
and now he'd clearly rather you
date my gay best friend than me.

15:37.642 --> 15:39.439
Oh, come on.
You know how dads are.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.164
He barely hears a word I say.

15:41.289 --> 15:43.089
Of course I told him about you.

15:43.427 --> 15:45.655
The only thing that registered
in the past two months

15:45.780 --> 15:47.912
were "football player"
and "boyfriend."

15:48.037 --> 15:50.110
Why didn't you tell me
he's such a sports nut?

15:50.235 --> 15:53.034
I could've studied.
You said he was just a regular guy.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.325
Aren't most regular
guys sports nuts?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.432
- So I'm an irregular guy?
- No!

15:57.557 --> 16:00.632
He is gonna love you,
all right? Come on.

16:04.153 --> 16:08.132
So cal here once won
the halftime free-throw contest.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.136
- Isn't that amazing?
- And rusty's his best friend!

16:13.443 --> 16:14.556
That's right, sir!

16:16.605 --> 16:18.130
Let me get that.

16:18.407 --> 16:20.031
Don't worry about that.

16:20.642 --> 16:21.876
Oh! That's all right.

16:22.239 --> 16:23.479
That's good.

16:23.977 --> 16:27.273
You know, the first time
I drank tequila,

16:27.564 --> 16:29.573
I spit it out. All over a girl.

16:30.194 --> 16:31.403
Good story.

16:31.699 --> 16:35.120
But, sir, don't think I'm
some reckless underage drinker.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.847
The reason I spit it out
was because that was he first time

16:37.972 --> 16:40.893
I ever drank. I'm in the honors
engineering program.

16:41.018 --> 16:42.688
We don't have time to drink.

16:42.813 --> 16:44.484
Leave that to communications majors.

16:44.609 --> 16:47.237
Communication majors.
Yes! Like my dad!

16:47.362 --> 16:50.925
Dad, we talk about the importance
of communication all the time.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.722
Yeah. So you spit your
tequila out all over a girl?

16:53.847 --> 16:56.497
Yes. Like I said,
it was the first time I drank.

16:56.622 --> 16:58.599
Can't you hold your liquor?
You're in a frat.

16:58.775 --> 17:00.220
- Yeah, I am!
- Good.

17:00.345 --> 17:02.415
Then we'll see what
you got on the field tomorrow?

17:02.540 --> 17:04.588
No, dad, rusty's
too busy studying...

17:04.713 --> 17:07.525
No, I'm not!
Of course I'm playing.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.852
All right.

17:09.431 --> 17:11.901
Great. Let's get you
another beer, dad.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.700
Can't wait to see
how fast you are off the line.

17:16.893 --> 17:19.453
Yeah, just wait till you see
how fast I am on the line.

17:19.696 --> 17:22.195
Make it stop, please make it stop.

17:29.060 --> 17:31.602
What happened to booktacular?
I waited for an hour.

17:32.249 --> 17:34.586
Can you believe that
after all that, she died?

17:36.927 --> 17:38.589
That's not Jodi Picoult!

17:40.060 --> 17:43.295
I did the dirty, OK?
I tried to tell you about it before...

17:43.515 --> 17:45.071
- With the landlady?
- Yes.

17:45.403 --> 17:47.481
It was magical... Ly disgusting.

17:47.715 --> 17:49.270
She made noises like a banshee,

17:49.395 --> 17:52.083
like a farm animal
in late-stage labor.

17:52.425 --> 17:55.114
Leaving me feeling as soiled
as the veterinarian's glove.

17:55.454 --> 17:57.248
Are you sure that you did it right?

17:58.236 --> 18:00.827
- And now god's mad at you?
- Yeah.

18:01.275 --> 18:04.361
I asked for forgiveness,
so everything should be fine.

18:08.564 --> 18:10.846
Speaking of things that are fine...

18:13.387 --> 18:15.088
Hail mary!

18:15.554 --> 18:18.221
- It's mary-elyse, actually.
- Oh, a girl with two names.

18:18.449 --> 18:19.892
Yeah, and three gods.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.755
What's the deal with
this trinity bunk?

18:21.880 --> 18:24.435
I know that the formalities of the
catholic church can seem daunting,

18:24.688 --> 18:28.412
but it offers an ordered path to
salvation that helps people find

18:28.537 --> 18:30.608
the answers that have eluded them
for centuries.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.518
I have heard your people
dole out some pretty harsh

18:33.643 --> 18:36.840
- punishments to sinners.
- Only if you've been very bad.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.799
You have no idea.

18:39.924 --> 18:42.932
Why don't the two of you join me
at mass tonight, 9pm,

18:43.289 --> 18:44.664
saint ignatius full of sorrow?

18:48.159 --> 18:50.587
All right. I'll be there.
But I'm not doing any kneeling.

18:50.894 --> 18:53.417
Oh, don't worry, I will.

18:57.316 --> 19:00.065
She told me she was 18,
but I knew she was lying.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.541
I acknowledge that.

19:01.666 --> 19:02.930
Now the other girl...

19:03.055 --> 19:05.215
Sorry, dad, casey's
gotta yell at me. Gotta go!

19:05.762 --> 19:07.786
I was gonna make up
something polite, but OK.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.330
I assume you're wondering
why I told ashleigh the truth.

19:11.455 --> 19:13.474
Yeah. That was the first
thing I was going to yell.

19:13.599 --> 19:15.684
I didn't trust you not
to tell her sooner or later.

19:15.809 --> 19:17.848
You're best friend.
You tell each other everything.

19:17.973 --> 19:20.028
As for the second thing
i'm going to yell...

19:20.153 --> 19:21.999
Why'd I drag you into it? Simple.

19:22.124 --> 19:24.142
Ashleigh's kind
of the best friend I have.

19:24.267 --> 19:26.131
I screwed up and
she may never forgive me.

19:26.256 --> 19:28.142
But I figured if
she's mad at both of us,

19:28.267 --> 19:30.502
it'd take a little
of the heat off me.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.324
I know, right?
I'm kinda brilliant.

19:32.449 --> 19:34.309
And kind of evil!

19:34.434 --> 19:37.802
You realize what you've done?
Ashleigh isn't like you, or even me.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.963
She's all heart.
This could destroy her.

19:40.088 --> 19:41.131
Let's go, girls.

19:45.524 --> 19:49.528
And now, the time has come for
the zbz father/daughter welcome song!

19:56.539 --> 20:00.543
Oh, daddy, daddy
I once sat on your knee

20:01.059 --> 20:05.063
and I still remember
the lessons you taught me

20:05.811 --> 20:07.963
like always eat your vegetables

20:08.088 --> 20:10.228
but first you must give thanks

20:10.353 --> 20:14.169
like never tell a lie
unless you want to die

20:15.227 --> 20:16.626
those aren't the words...

20:16.751 --> 20:18.354
Like never trust a slut

20:18.479 --> 20:20.735
who has a big ol'butt

20:24.471 --> 20:26.765
I do not have a big ol'butt!

20:26.935 --> 20:28.527
You do have a big mouth, though.

20:28.652 --> 20:30.687
All right. Let's settle
this right now, you and me!

20:30.986 --> 20:32.265
Yeah, bitch.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.439
- You're the bitch.
- You're both bitches!

20:44.157 --> 20:45.787
Anyone else turned on right now?

20:47.055 --> 20:49.121
What? Those aren't my daughters.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.083
We're supposed to be sisters!

21:11.234 --> 21:14.229
Girls, we can't help if you
don't tell us what's wrong.

21:14.502 --> 21:16.462
Is it possible that
there's something going on

21:16.587 --> 21:19.039
that may have put all
three of you in bad moods?

21:19.164 --> 21:21.024
Something... In the body?

21:21.262 --> 21:24.014
'cause I read that when
girls live together...

21:24.139 --> 21:26.242
No, dad, it's not our periods.

21:26.411 --> 21:28.347
OK. Well, if it's not hormonal,

21:28.472 --> 21:30.669
why can't the three of you
just talk it out?

21:30.915 --> 21:32.331
Sounds good to me.

21:33.137 --> 21:35.293
I don't have anything
to talk to you about.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.356
You kissed my boyfriend.
And you hid it from me.

21:38.481 --> 21:40.696
Wait. Fisher? Where does
he live? I will kick his ass!

21:40.884 --> 21:42.012
Sit down, dad.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.982
Becky, are you self-sabotaging
again?

21:45.107 --> 21:47.788
Please don't let our unstable
relationship sully your ability

21:47.913 --> 21:50.608
- to form lasting bonds.
- Shut up, dad.

21:50.733 --> 21:52.387
Your dad is right, rebecca.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.507
You should learn to keep
your hands off other girls' boyfriends.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.023
You kept your hands off
cappie during spring break?

21:58.208 --> 22:00.526
You were broken up.
And we only kissed.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.903
- I only kissed fisher!
- We weren't broken up.

22:03.104 --> 22:04.536
And you slept with evan!

22:04.661 --> 22:06.491
At least I didn't sleep
with a 16-year-old!

22:06.835 --> 22:07.992
Omd.

22:08.443 --> 22:11.142
You know what? I didn't
betray either one of you.

22:11.267 --> 22:12.757
And I never would.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.797
Do you think it might be a good
idea to go apologize to ashleigh?

22:16.922 --> 22:18.308
Dad, I'm not a child!

22:20.672 --> 22:23.048
Becky, I beg you,
call my hypnotherapist.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.118
You need to deal with your
narcissistic attention-seeking.

22:26.243 --> 22:29.583
I am not gonna be lectured by a
man who missed my ballet recital

22:29.793 --> 22:32.182
because he was busy filibustering
a legislative aide.

22:36.418 --> 22:39.399
Well, that didn't go as well
as could be expected.

22:39.713 --> 22:42.239
For what it's worth,
I was thinking the same thing.

22:42.364 --> 22:44.375
About the periods and bodies.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.214
Women and their emotions!

22:46.768 --> 22:48.268
Rofl.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.785
I did get the impression ashleigh
was a little bit hyper-emotional.

22:52.059 --> 22:54.028
We're just talking
about a little kiss.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.344
My daughter is the victim here.

22:56.628 --> 23:00.086
Victim? Do we really need to use
politically-correct language?

23:00.380 --> 23:02.777
I will use whatever language
I want when talking about

23:02.902 --> 23:04.588
your daughter betraying my daughter.

23:04.713 --> 23:07.647
All right, let's just
calm down right now!

23:09.432 --> 23:11.846
But ken, you have to admit,
when it comes to rebecca,

23:11.971 --> 23:15.518
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree. Right?

23:21.400 --> 23:24.359
Your daughter should have
told my daughter the truth.

23:27.929 --> 23:31.933
I've never been talked to
in such a displeasing manner.

23:36.653 --> 23:38.320
I suck at football.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.437
You gotta help me think
of a way out of this game.

23:40.562 --> 23:42.562
But it's gotta be a manly way.

23:44.658 --> 23:47.477
How about tomorrow you say
we went bungee jumping,

23:47.602 --> 23:50.367
I got injured trying to rescue you.
That sounds bad-ass, right?

23:50.492 --> 23:52.635
OK. Don't sweat the game, rusty.

23:52.760 --> 23:54.301
Is that some kind of sports lingo?

23:54.426 --> 23:55.707
If it is, I don't get it.

23:55.832 --> 23:57.996
Every year, the fraternity
team throws the game.

23:58.578 --> 24:00.276
That means we let the dads win.

24:00.401 --> 24:02.483
Makes them feel
young and virile for a

24:02.608 --> 24:04.644
brief, shining moment,
until they go back to

24:04.769 --> 24:06.844
aging wives and unrewarding
white-collar jobs,

24:06.969 --> 24:08.487
counting the days until retirement.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.237
So I have to help you lose?

24:10.362 --> 24:12.628
- I can do that.
- Yes.

24:12.753 --> 24:14.865
Your total lack of athletic
prowess will fit right in.

24:14.990 --> 24:17.141
Now go pay attention
to your girlfriend instead

24:17.266 --> 24:19.117
of obsessing about her dad.

24:19.530 --> 24:20.542
Thanks, cal.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.129
Yeah?

24:25.548 --> 24:27.348
Don't let him see you run.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.732
Nice.

24:45.680 --> 24:46.909
I'm such an idiot.

24:49.137 --> 24:52.037
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

24:52.829 --> 24:54.825
I find that a little hard
to believe right now.

24:54.995 --> 24:58.032
I was drunk.
And I screwed up big time.

24:58.372 --> 25:00.648
I didn't even know what was
happening until it happened.

25:00.963 --> 25:03.543
Believe me, if there was any way
I could take it back...

25:03.795 --> 25:05.292
But that's the problem.

25:06.151 --> 25:07.532
I can't believe you anymore.

25:07.657 --> 25:10.464
When someone cheats on me,
then it's over.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.846
Even if it was just a kiss?

25:15.014 --> 25:17.097
I thought we really had
something great together.

25:17.397 --> 25:19.960
We still can. Please?

25:24.676 --> 25:26.315
How can I trust you again?

25:26.975 --> 25:27.975
I can't.

25:40.215 --> 25:42.753
The idolatry wasn't nearly
as distracting as I'd imagined.

25:42.878 --> 25:44.583
I'm glad you guys enjoyed mass.

25:44.815 --> 25:47.836
Absolutely. The priest gave me a bunch
of hail marys to atone for my sin.

25:48.007 --> 25:49.349
Plus, the beads.

25:49.474 --> 25:51.066
Have any literature on flogging?

25:51.505 --> 25:53.332
Mary-elyse, we should
we get out of here.

25:53.457 --> 25:55.976
No. Hold on, buddy. I got a few more
questions for mary-elyse.

25:56.195 --> 26:00.199
What say we go get a cup of coffee
and really dig deep into vatican ii?

26:01.394 --> 26:02.940
- Sure...
- Fantastic.

26:03.065 --> 26:04.584
Excuse me. Sorry.

26:05.370 --> 26:08.022
I need mary-elyse for the night.
You can have her tomorrow.

26:08.147 --> 26:10.182
What kind of sucker
do you take me for?

26:10.307 --> 26:13.256
My spiritual needs outweigh carnal ones.
She's mine tonight.

26:14.645 --> 26:16.876
I know we agreed
our friendship benefits

26:17.001 --> 26:19.333
from avoiding expression
of deep emotions.

26:19.458 --> 26:22.611
Yeah. Agreed, especially due to our
shared past with the same woman.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.796
Right. But look.

26:31.311 --> 26:34.682
The truth is
i'm in a little bit of a funk.

26:38.425 --> 26:39.512
All right, just go.

26:39.783 --> 26:41.135
Yes! Bless you.

26:42.052 --> 26:43.085
Come on.

26:45.824 --> 26:47.035
After you.

27:11.415 --> 27:13.039
We have to talk about this.

27:13.699 --> 27:17.550
You're my best friend. I hate
to see you hurt like this.

27:17.743 --> 27:21.167
That's why I didn't tell you.
I was trying to protect you.

27:21.292 --> 27:24.055
- You're such a good person...
- I'm a good person.

27:24.518 --> 27:27.715
That doesn't make me
incapable of handling this.

27:29.267 --> 27:30.313
I know that.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.991
- Ash, I was just...
- I dumped fisher.

27:34.452 --> 27:35.452
Really?

27:36.820 --> 27:37.862
Are you sure?

27:38.031 --> 27:39.881
It was just a kiss.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.784
Case, I'm not exactly like you.

27:42.042 --> 27:45.350
I'm not cool enough to stay
with my boyfriend after he cheats on me.

27:45.902 --> 27:48.916
- It's not always that simple.
- Well, for me, it is.

27:59.863 --> 28:00.971
Gotcha!

28:20.825 --> 28:22.243
I have one question.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.118
Yeah, I have some in the drawer.

28:24.243 --> 28:25.894
What? Really?

28:29.731 --> 28:31.660
But I actually wanted to ask you

28:31.920 --> 28:33.812
if you think your dad was impressed
that

28:33.937 --> 28:35.616
I was gonna play in
the game tomorrow.

28:35.741 --> 28:36.881
Seriously?

28:37.006 --> 28:39.082
I don't want to talk
about my dad right now.

28:51.906 --> 28:53.814
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

29:07.154 --> 29:08.621
Sweetie, I think I left my...

29:16.255 --> 29:19.206
What the hell are you
doing to my daughter?

29:50.416 --> 29:53.822
Sir, I just want to apologize
again for last night.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.367
I know what it looked like,
but I was giving her a back rub.

29:57.492 --> 29:59.379
I know exactly
what you were rubbing.

29:59.652 --> 30:02.556
Now how about we settle this
on the field, cartwright?

30:02.681 --> 30:04.090
I'm fine right here.

30:04.215 --> 30:05.636
What's the matter, you scared?

30:07.014 --> 30:09.377
Because I'm about to bring the pain.

30:12.227 --> 30:13.309
Sounds good.

30:14.306 --> 30:15.428
Can't wait!

30:16.404 --> 30:17.597
Good!

30:17.722 --> 30:19.197
I'll see you out there.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.154
Ready for the big game?

30:30.279 --> 30:31.495
Ready as I'll ever be.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.871
Sorry for, butting in yesterday.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.570
I know that was none of my business.

30:38.632 --> 30:41.045
You know, if you curl
your fingers up as you cut,

30:41.274 --> 30:43.607
you're less likely
to get nicked. You want to be careful.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.153
I am careful.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.811
Why is it so hard for you to
trust that I know what I'm doing?

30:47.936 --> 30:49.719
You'll always be my little girl.

30:49.844 --> 30:52.109
If I had my way, I'd always
be able to protect you

30:52.234 --> 30:53.826
as easily as I could back then.

30:53.951 --> 30:57.604
But the good thing about growing up
is that you taught me to protect myself.

30:57.729 --> 31:00.287
When you baby me, it makes me
feel like you think I'm an idiot.

31:00.412 --> 31:01.885
I don't think you're an idiot.

31:02.010 --> 31:04.464
- But you make me feel that way.
- I'm just trying to protect you,

31:04.589 --> 31:06.952
just like you were
trying to protect ashleigh.

31:15.025 --> 31:16.799
What a wonderful world.

31:16.924 --> 31:18.750
If I was one of those
douchebags who say,

31:18.875 --> 31:20.880
"i'm high on life,"
i'd say it right now.

31:21.005 --> 31:23.113
Have you talked to mary-elyse today?

31:23.238 --> 31:26.129
I left her a few messages.
I think I got a bum set of beads.

31:26.254 --> 31:28.670
I was rubbing these
up and down all night,

31:28.795 --> 31:30.553
and I feel just as impure as before.

31:30.723 --> 31:33.243
Now that you mention it,
i'm waiting for the lovely m-e

31:33.368 --> 31:35.412
to return my calls.

31:38.356 --> 31:40.394
And speaking of the angel...

31:43.927 --> 31:45.902
- Should I buy a hair shirt?
- How about a date?

31:46.243 --> 31:47.598
Excuse me for a moment.

31:49.036 --> 31:50.792
You're kind of smothering me.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.036
Both of you.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.596
- You're cute.
- Thank you.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.468
But leaving me five messages
since last night?

32:01.316 --> 32:02.585
That's creepy.

32:05.449 --> 32:08.299
As for your messages, dale, I didn't
appreciate your threatening tone.

32:09.042 --> 32:11.010
Maybe you're not catholic material.

32:21.316 --> 32:23.650
"Grown men" on three! Let's go!
One, two, three!

32:23.775 --> 32:24.997
Grown men!

32:25.122 --> 32:26.256
Let's go!

32:37.447 --> 32:39.038
Ready, set, hut, hut, hut!

32:42.502 --> 32:43.801
Come on!

32:47.675 --> 32:48.970
Here! Come on!

32:50.468 --> 32:51.468
I'm open!

33:00.450 --> 33:01.840
What are you doing?

33:02.356 --> 33:03.671
- Fumble!
- Time out!

33:04.606 --> 33:07.135
- What the hell was that?
- Dumb call!

33:07.260 --> 33:09.660
Are you blind?
Can you see over here?

33:09.864 --> 33:11.121
I'm wide open!

33:11.631 --> 33:13.767
This game is gonna be
harder to throw than we thought.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.390
- Come on. Let's get in.
- It's all right.

33:18.269 --> 33:21.040
- Throw it to me. I was wide open.
- Wide open like your daughter!

33:23.164 --> 33:26.545
- Let's just focus on the game here.
- Don't patronize me, Cartwright.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.798
Same play. It's gonna work.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.780
Grown men on three. One, two, three.

33:31.905 --> 33:33.458
- Grown men!
- Let's go, boys.

33:37.302 --> 33:38.515
Can I sit with you?

33:39.968 --> 33:40.968
Maybe.

33:49.189 --> 33:50.211
I...

33:50.336 --> 33:51.987
should have given you more credit.

33:52.572 --> 33:56.332
Of course you can take care of yourself.
And I should have told you about fisher.

33:57.537 --> 33:59.057
I'm so sorry, Ash.

34:01.654 --> 34:02.654
That's OK.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.684
You meant well.

34:06.058 --> 34:07.753
And I kind of need
my best friend back,

34:07.921 --> 34:11.255
especially since I just had
my heart broken and all.

34:12.505 --> 34:13.505
Come here.

34:16.909 --> 34:18.232
Are we making up now?

34:18.436 --> 34:19.598
We're still mad at you!

34:33.783 --> 34:34.947
Nice one, Dad!

34:35.251 --> 34:36.699
Better luck next time, Rus!

34:36.867 --> 34:38.447
Eat my dust, Cartwright!

34:56.547 --> 34:58.512
Rusty, no! It's flag football!

35:08.672 --> 35:09.672
Oh, my God!

35:13.681 --> 35:14.834
Eat that!

35:16.031 --> 35:18.141
- Is it over? Did we win?
- Rusty, what did you do?

35:18.266 --> 35:20.284
- What?
- My back!

35:22.562 --> 35:23.899
- Honey.
- You OK?

35:24.526 --> 35:25.622
He frickin' tackled!

35:26.543 --> 35:29.501
- I know. I saw.
- God, what did he do?

35:35.334 --> 35:37.851
Hey. May I have a pitcher
of beer? Thanks.

35:38.511 --> 35:39.511
Right away.

35:42.835 --> 35:44.134
What are you doing here?

35:44.496 --> 35:45.893
{\pos(192,210)}You're not a ZBZ dad.

35:46.489 --> 35:48.082
{\pos(192,210)}Well, not that I know of.

35:48.999 --> 35:50.092
{\pos(192,210)}Who won the game?

35:50.429 --> 35:53.108
{\pos(192,210)}It was called on account
of a medical emergency.

35:55.188 --> 35:57.493
{\pos(192,210)}Which, fortunately,
was just a pulled muscle.

35:57.618 --> 36:00.854
Jordan's dad is resting comfortably,
being tended to by his daughter.

36:02.730 --> 36:03.942
Rusty tackled him.

36:05.217 --> 36:06.224
I warned him.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.458
Hemingway? At dobler's?

36:09.921 --> 36:12.316
New book club selection. I'm behind.

36:12.552 --> 36:14.474
I keep finding myself preoccupied.

36:18.613 --> 36:20.060
- Here you go.
- We...

36:20.185 --> 36:22.478
We read that
in my freshman lit class.

36:25.222 --> 36:26.568
Tragic love story.

36:27.082 --> 36:28.398
Some would say.

36:29.830 --> 36:32.439
Yeah, they just couldn't seem
to get the timing right.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.942
{\pos(192,210)}And then he got his junk blown off
in World War I.

36:39.220 --> 36:40.418
{\pos(192,210)}See ya.

37:01.779 --> 37:04.763
You think Jordan will break up with me
now that I almost killed her dad?

37:04.931 --> 37:08.308
When I offered to go to his hotel,
she said that wasn't a good idea.

37:10.084 --> 37:12.589
Trying to impress a girl's father
is a losing battle.

37:13.506 --> 37:15.973
It's hard not to be the only man
in your daughter's life.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.114
And it's hard to admit
they need someone else.

37:22.972 --> 37:25.665
Why do you think I hated
all of Casey's high school boyfriends?

37:28.939 --> 37:32.207
So are you saying that Jack is probably
just as scared of me as I am of him?

37:32.588 --> 37:34.187
You did almost paralyze him, son.

37:35.698 --> 37:37.421
Yeah, that wasn't good.

37:39.508 --> 37:43.003
I would have thrown it to you
if I thought you'd catch it.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.044
It's not about catching.
It's about throwing.

37:46.169 --> 37:48.424
You wouldn't have caught it.
You have sandals.

37:48.549 --> 37:49.892
You're both wrong.

37:51.357 --> 37:52.502
This is ridiculous.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.448
You guys!

37:57.625 --> 37:59.151
You guys are all adults.

37:59.319 --> 38:02.402
Whatever is going on
between Ashleigh, Rebecca and me

38:02.799 --> 38:04.156
doesn't involve you.

38:04.324 --> 38:07.388
And didn't the fact that
one of your own got taken down by Rusty

38:07.513 --> 38:09.582
remind you that you're not getting
any younger,

38:09.707 --> 38:11.830
and life is too short
to hold a grudge.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.667
Dad. Would you like to start?

38:15.986 --> 38:19.421
Is there something you want to say
to mr. Logan and Mr. Howard?

38:20.790 --> 38:21.840
No hard feelings?

38:22.008 --> 38:25.427
Well, I'd like to apologize
if I insinuated that your daughter is...

38:25.595 --> 38:27.721
- There's no need to expand on that!
- OK!

38:28.201 --> 38:29.306
Apology acknowledged.

38:33.904 --> 38:34.904
Well done.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.409
So I don't suppose I can convince you
that life is too short to hold a grudge

38:51.534 --> 38:53.580
against me? For one little kiss?

38:58.146 --> 38:59.294
I acknowledge that.

39:12.140 --> 39:15.102
Have I walked into a
transgenderedcathycomic?

39:20.607 --> 39:22.555
Guess you're breaking up
with catholicism?

39:23.312 --> 39:25.490
Don't sweat it.
It was a rebound religion anyway.

39:25.917 --> 39:27.990
Just like Mary-Elyse
was a rebound girl for me.

39:28.158 --> 39:29.622
Who are you rebounding from?

39:30.594 --> 39:32.035
You know our woman in common?

39:33.163 --> 39:34.644
I think I wasn't over her.

39:35.748 --> 39:38.688
Even though I had the chance to be
with her, and I didn't take it.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.857
That is so Casey.

39:40.982 --> 39:43.676
You know, she makes you love her
and then she turns away.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.419
I am in a funk. And I guess

39:47.075 --> 39:49.970
book clubs, tennis, video games,

39:50.138 --> 39:53.540
beer and even the lovely
and treacherous Mary-Elyse

39:53.665 --> 39:55.183
aren't gonna make it easier.

39:55.546 --> 39:56.560
Word.

39:56.728 --> 40:00.397
But the important thing is there's lot
of other girls, and gods, in the sea.

40:01.943 --> 40:05.110
You know, I don't want another god.
I just want mine back.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.528
I hear.

40:27.096 --> 40:28.656
Saved one of your favorites.

40:29.424 --> 40:30.424
Red velvet.

41:10.503 --> 41:12.010
Sorry I almost paralyzed your dad.

41:12.430 --> 41:13.614
He's fine now.

41:13.739 --> 41:15.305
You might have done him a favor.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.933
He promised to finally
go get a physical.

41:18.783 --> 41:20.093
He should thank me then.

41:20.572 --> 41:22.100
Yeah, don't push it.

41:26.506 --> 41:28.401
Do you mind that your dad
doesn't like me?

41:29.477 --> 41:32.123
I think that I like you enough
for the both of us.

41:54.230 --> 41:56.284
Your dad isn't gonna stop by, is he?

41:56.409 --> 41:58.014
I don't think so, but...

41:58.182 --> 42:00.440
Let's wait until he goes back
to Columbus.

42:11.512 --> 42:12.512
So...

42:12.868 --> 42:14.823
You ready to get your old dad
out of your hair?

42:15.832 --> 42:18.618
I'm gonna miss you, dad.
I had a lot of fun this weekend.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.087
Even with all the...

42:20.687 --> 42:21.935
Craziness.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.457
Me too.

42:24.334 --> 42:27.460
It's not my business, but did you figure
everything out with your gal pals?

42:27.742 --> 42:28.883
More or less.

42:29.172 --> 42:30.640
You know, college,

42:31.710 --> 42:32.878
lots of drama.

42:34.561 --> 42:36.279
Don't let the drama get you down.

42:37.010 --> 42:39.868
Ever since you were a little girl,
you've been able to handle anything.

42:40.653 --> 42:42.559
Now that you're not
a little girl anymore,

42:42.727 --> 42:44.971
the world better look out
for my daughter.

42:46.142 --> 42:47.173
Thanks, dad.

42:47.860 --> 42:49.691
It's nice you think that about me.

42:49.859 --> 42:51.109
It's the truth.

42:58.015 --> 43:00.202
- You sure you changed that oil?
- Dad!

43:00.370 --> 43:01.741
Just checking!

43:09.462 --> 43:10.503
Love you.

43:10.795 --> 43:11.880
Love you, too.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.642
{/ecriture tableau de bord}

43:23.810 --> 43:24.810
Crap.
