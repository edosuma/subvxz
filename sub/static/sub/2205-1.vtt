00:43.360 --> 00:46.500
Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom,

00:46.600 --> 00:49.610
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods.

00:52.160 --> 00:53.420
I wish

00:53.520 --> 00:55.220
And in this village...

00:55.320 --> 00:56.940
More than anything

00:57.040 --> 00:58.780
...lived a young maiden...

00:58.880 --> 01:02.641
More than life
More than jewels

01:03.320 --> 01:05.099
...a carefree young lad...

01:05.200 --> 01:06.765
I wish

01:08.080 --> 01:09.884
More than life

01:10.080 --> 01:12.487
...and a childless baker...

01:12.680 --> 01:13.860
I wish

01:13.960 --> 01:15.380
...with his wife.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.620
- More than anything
- More than the moon

01:17.720 --> 01:18.700
I wish

01:18.800 --> 01:20.700
The King is giving a Festival

01:20.800 --> 01:21.860
More than life

01:21.960 --> 01:23.420
- I wish
- I wish to go to the Festival

01:23.520 --> 01:24.500
More than riches

01:24.600 --> 01:25.660
And the Ball

01:25.760 --> 01:27.420
I wish my cow would give us some milk

01:27.520 --> 01:30.180
- More than anything
- I wish we had a child

01:30.280 --> 01:31.380
Please, pal

01:31.480 --> 01:33.180
I want a child

01:33.280 --> 01:34.820
I wish to go to the Festival

01:34.920 --> 01:36.380
I wish you'd give us
some milk or even cheese

01:36.480 --> 01:37.761
I wish

01:40.640 --> 01:42.420
You wish to go to the Festival?

01:42.520 --> 01:44.380
The poor girl's parents had died.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.140
You, Cinderella, the Festival?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.020
You wish to go to the Festival?

01:48.120 --> 01:51.180
The Festival? The King's Festival?

01:51.280 --> 01:53.020
And now she lived with her stepmother.

01:53.120 --> 01:55.163
The Festival?

01:55.480 --> 01:58.047
Who had two daughters of her own.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.380
- Look at your nails
- Look at your dress

02:00.480 --> 02:02.180
- People would laugh at you
- Nevertheless

02:02.280 --> 02:04.100
She still wants to go to the Festival

02:04.200 --> 02:05.606
And dance before the Prince

02:09.680 --> 02:11.860
All three were beautiful of face,

02:11.960 --> 02:14.242
but vile and black of heart.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.700
The young lad had no father,
and his mother...

02:18.800 --> 02:19.780
I wish

02:19.880 --> 02:21.700
...well, she was at her wits' end.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.367
I wish my son were not a fool

02:25.320 --> 02:28.000
I wish my house was not a mess

02:29.040 --> 02:30.820
I wish the cow was full of milk

02:30.920 --> 02:32.740
I wish the walls were full of gold

02:32.840 --> 02:35.327
I wish a lot of things

02:35.640 --> 02:37.820
What in heaven's name
are you doing with the cow

02:37.920 --> 02:39.380
inside the house?

02:39.480 --> 02:42.340
I thought if he were nice and warm,
he might produce some milk.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.324
It's a she!

02:44.440 --> 02:46.300
How many times do I
have to tell you that

02:46.400 --> 02:48.489
only "she"s can give milk?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.300
And then,
there was a hungry little girl,

02:55.400 --> 02:56.900
who always wore a red cape.

02:57.000 --> 02:57.980
Hey!

02:58.080 --> 02:59.486
I wish

02:59.760 --> 03:02.770
It's not for me
It's for my granny in the woods

03:03.200 --> 03:06.210
A loaf of bread
Please

03:06.480 --> 03:09.220
To bring my poor old
hungry granny In the woods

03:09.320 --> 03:12.524
Just a loaf of bread
Please

03:16.600 --> 03:17.740
Cinderella.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.566
If you can pick up these lentils,

03:21.200 --> 03:24.340
and finish your chores in time,

03:24.440 --> 03:26.220
then you may go to the Ball with us.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.500
Come along, ladies.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.723
Yes, Mother.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.561
Good luck.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.300
Come, little birds

03:45.400 --> 03:47.620
Down from the eaves and the leaves

03:47.720 --> 03:51.242
Over fields, out of castles and ponds

03:52.160 --> 03:55.330
No, squeeze, pal

04:12.760 --> 04:15.700
Quick, little birds
Flick through the ashes

04:15.800 --> 04:18.420
Pick and peck, but swiftly
Sift through the ashes

04:18.519 --> 04:20.563
Into the pot

04:25.040 --> 04:26.060
Bull's-eye!

04:26.160 --> 04:27.700
What are you doing?

04:27.800 --> 04:29.047
Stop your pretending!

04:30.040 --> 04:31.700
Now listen to me well, son.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.860
Milky-White must be taken to market.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.420
Mother, no!
He's the best cow in the world!

04:35.520 --> 04:38.180
Was. She has been dry for weeks now.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.740
We've no food or money
and no choice but to sell her.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.340
But Milky-White's my best friend!

04:42.440 --> 04:43.687
Look at her!

04:43.880 --> 04:46.321
There are bugs on her dugs

04:46.440 --> 04:49.060
There are flies in her eyes

04:49.160 --> 04:52.700
There's a lump on her rump
Big enough to be a hump

04:52.800 --> 04:55.207
- But, Mother...
- We've no time to sit and dither

04:55.520 --> 04:58.291
While her withers wither with her

04:58.680 --> 05:01.500
And no one keeps a cow for a friend

05:01.600 --> 05:04.929
Sometimes I wonder
what's going on in that head of yours.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.300
Into the woods, it's time to go

05:10.400 --> 05:12.300
I hate to leave, I have to, though

05:12.400 --> 05:13.940
Into the woods, it's time and so

05:14.040 --> 05:15.940
I must begin my journey

05:16.040 --> 05:17.700
Into the woods and through the trees

05:17.800 --> 05:19.740
To where I am expected, ma'am

05:19.840 --> 05:21.580
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house

05:21.680 --> 05:23.300
- Stop it.
- I can't just...

05:23.400 --> 05:25.340
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house

05:25.440 --> 05:26.900
Are you certain of your way?

05:27.000 --> 05:30.420
The way is clear
The light is good

05:30.520 --> 05:34.180
I have no fear
Nor no one should

05:34.280 --> 05:37.820
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood

05:37.920 --> 05:41.580
I sort of hate to ask it
But do you have a basket?

05:41.680 --> 05:42.700
Yes, we do.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.180
I don't suppose
you're planning on buying any of these?

05:45.280 --> 05:48.620
Now, don't stray and be late, all right?

05:48.720 --> 05:51.180
You might save
some of those sweets for Granny.

05:51.280 --> 05:52.740
- Oh, my...
- Just leave it.

05:52.840 --> 05:54.246
She's a thief!

05:54.480 --> 05:56.180
Into the woods and down the dell

05:56.280 --> 05:57.891
The path is straight, I know it well

05:58.120 --> 05:59.700
Into the woods, and who can tell

05:59.800 --> 06:01.740
What's waiting on the journey

06:01.840 --> 06:03.500
Into the woods to bring some bread

06:03.600 --> 06:05.500
To Granny who is sick in bed

06:05.600 --> 06:07.220
Never can tell what lies ahead

06:07.320 --> 06:09.820
For all that I know, she's already dead

06:09.920 --> 06:12.860
But into the woods
Into the woods

06:12.960 --> 06:14.620
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house

06:14.720 --> 06:16.922
And home before dark

06:23.200 --> 06:24.900
Cinderella!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.420
Get up here!

06:26.520 --> 06:30.140
Fly, birds
Back to the sky

06:30.240 --> 06:31.540
We're waiting!

06:31.640 --> 06:33.580
Back to the eaves and the leaves

06:33.680 --> 06:35.100
And the fields and the...

06:35.200 --> 06:37.060
Hurry up and do my hair, Cinderella

06:37.160 --> 06:39.010
Are you really wearing that?

06:39.160 --> 06:41.300
Here, I found a little tear, Cinderella

06:41.400 --> 06:42.780
Can't you hide it with a hat?

06:42.880 --> 06:45.140
- You look beautiful
- I know.

06:45.240 --> 06:46.740
- She means me.
- No, she didn't.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.860
Mother said be good
Father said be nice

06:48.960 --> 06:50.380
That was always their advice

06:50.480 --> 06:52.900
So be nice, Cinderella
Good Cinderella

06:53.000 --> 06:54.740
- Nice good, good nice
- Tighter!

06:54.840 --> 06:57.220
What's the good of being good
If everyone is blind

06:57.320 --> 07:00.340
Always leaving you behind
Never mind, Cinderella

07:00.440 --> 07:03.041
Kind Cinderella
Nice, good, nice, kind, good, nice

07:04.680 --> 07:07.121
Not that tight! Clod!

07:18.520 --> 07:19.580
Who might that be?

07:19.680 --> 07:22.406
We've sold our last loaf of bread!

07:24.360 --> 07:26.801
It's the Witch from next door.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.620
We have no bread.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.060
I don't want your bread.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.580
Then what is it you wish?

07:40.680 --> 07:43.380
It's not what I wish.
It's what you wish.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.728
Nothing cooking in that
belly now, is there?

07:46.280 --> 07:48.403
And there will never be.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.046
Unless

07:50.680 --> 07:53.360
you do exactly as I say.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.727
In three days' time,
a Blue Moon will appear.

07:58.160 --> 08:01.569
Only then can the curse be undone.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.770
What curse?

08:04.240 --> 08:06.100
The one I placed on this house.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.845
What are you talking about?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.820
In the past,

08:10.920 --> 08:13.100
When you were no more than a babe,

08:13.200 --> 08:17.485
your father brought
his young wife and you to this cottage.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.362
They were a lovely couple.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.201
But not lovely neighbors.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.241
You see, your mother was with child,

08:28.240 --> 08:31.603
and she developed an unusual appetite.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.220
She admired my beautiful garden,

08:34.320 --> 08:36.220
and she told your father

08:36.320 --> 08:38.580
that what she wanted

08:38.679 --> 08:41.380
more than anything in the world...

08:41.480 --> 08:44.340
Was greens, greens
Nothing but greens

08:44.440 --> 08:47.020
Parsley, peppers, cabbages and celery

08:47.120 --> 08:49.340
Asparagus and watercress
And fiddleferns and lettuce

08:49.440 --> 08:52.180
He said, "All right"
But it wasn't, quite

08:52.280 --> 08:54.721
'Cause I caught him
in the autumn In my garden one night

08:59.920 --> 09:02.940
He was robbing me
Raping me

09:03.040 --> 09:05.660
Rooting through my rutabaga
Raiding my arugula

09:05.760 --> 09:08.500
And ripping up the rampion
My champion, my favorite

09:08.600 --> 09:11.690
I should've laid a spell
on him right there.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.961
I could've turned him into stone.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.170
Or a dog.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.005
Or a chair.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.620
But I let him
have the rampion I'd lots to spare

09:25.720 --> 09:28.180
In return, however I said, "Fair is fair

09:28.280 --> 09:31.484
"You can let me have the baby
That your wife will bear

09:32.120 --> 09:33.890
"And we'll call it square"

09:34.040 --> 09:35.526
I had a brother?

09:36.280 --> 09:37.527
No.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.923
But you had a sister.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.020
Where is she?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.580
She's mine now,

09:44.680 --> 09:46.689
and you'll never find her.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.403
A small price to pay
for what else your father stole from me.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.480
It cost me my youth, my beauty.

09:53.720 --> 09:55.340
My mother warned me

09:55.440 --> 09:59.770
she would punish me with the curse of
ugliness if I ever lost any of them.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.740
Lost what?

10:01.840 --> 10:02.900
The beans

10:03.000 --> 10:04.740
- Beans?
- The special beans

10:04.840 --> 10:07.361
I let him go
I didn't know he'd stolen my beans

10:07.520 --> 10:10.180
I was watching him crawl
Back over the wall

10:10.280 --> 10:13.404
When bang, crash
A lightning flash

10:23.760 --> 10:25.980
Well, that's another story
Never mind, anyway

10:26.080 --> 10:28.940
At last, the big day came
I made my claim

10:29.040 --> 10:31.420
"Oh, don't take away the baby"
They shrieked and squeaked

10:31.520 --> 10:34.580
But I did, and I hid her
Where she'll never be reached

10:34.680 --> 10:36.980
Your father cried
And your mother died

10:37.080 --> 10:39.540
When for extra measure
I admit, it was a pleasure

10:39.640 --> 10:42.460
I said, "Sorry, I'm still not mollified"

10:42.560 --> 10:44.808
And I laid a little spell on them

10:45.160 --> 10:46.566
You, too, son.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.327
That your family tree would always be

10:51.480 --> 10:53.330
a barren one.

10:55.520 --> 10:57.060
How could you do that?

10:57.160 --> 10:59.100
And when your mother died,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.528
your father deserted you.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.980
Your father was no father,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.408
so why should you be?

11:07.320 --> 11:10.046
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:10.520 --> 11:13.180
Now there's no more fuss
And there's no more scenes

11:13.280 --> 11:16.020
And my garden thrives
You should see my nectarines

11:16.120 --> 11:18.300
But I'm telling you the same
I tell kings and queens

11:18.400 --> 11:21.649
Don't ever, never, ever
Mess around with my greens

11:22.160 --> 11:24.169
Especially the beans

11:27.200 --> 11:29.380
Yeah, but why
do we have to go to the next village?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.860
Because everyone in this village knows

11:30.960 --> 11:32.740
the cow hasn't given
a drop of milk in weeks.

11:32.840 --> 11:33.980
But that's cheating.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.780
We're starving, Jack!

11:35.880 --> 11:37.900
Don't you understand that?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.568
Now, you're not to
accept less than five pounds for her.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.700
Are you listening to me?

11:43.800 --> 11:44.820
Yes.

11:44.920 --> 11:46.220
How much are you to ask?

11:46.320 --> 11:47.940
No more than five pounds.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.242
- Less than five!
- Than five!

11:50.480 --> 11:52.260
Into the woods, the time is now

11:52.360 --> 11:54.380
We have to live, I don't care how

11:54.480 --> 11:56.060
Into the woods to sell the cow

11:56.160 --> 11:58.260
You must begin the journey

11:58.360 --> 12:00.020
Straight through the woods,
and don't delay

12:00.120 --> 12:01.980
We have to face the marketplace

12:02.080 --> 12:04.931
Into the woods to journey's end

12:05.720 --> 12:08.651
Into the woods to sell a friend

12:11.440 --> 12:14.610
You wish to have the curse reversed?

12:14.920 --> 12:17.420
I'll need a certain potion first.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.610
Go to the wood and bring me back...

12:20.760 --> 12:24.601
One, the cow as white as milk.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.620
Two, the cape as red as blood.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.580
Three, the hair as yellow as corn.

12:32.680 --> 12:37.204
Four, the slipper as pure as gold.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.860
Bring me these

12:39.960 --> 12:43.780
before the chime of midnight
in three days' time.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.740
'Tis then the Blue Moon reappears,

12:46.840 --> 12:50.140
which comes but once each hundred years.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.660
Bring them and I guarantee

12:52.760 --> 12:56.726
a child as perfect as child can be.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.566
Go to the wood!

13:12.840 --> 13:14.804
Ladies, our carriage awaits!

13:15.160 --> 13:17.180
Now may I go to the Festival?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.460
The Festival?

13:18.560 --> 13:20.580
Darling, those nails
Darling, those clothes

13:20.680 --> 13:22.500
The lentils are one thing
But darling, with those

13:22.600 --> 13:24.460
You'd make us the fools of the Festival

13:24.560 --> 13:26.728
And mortify the Prince

13:27.520 --> 13:29.180
The Festival lasts three nights.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.084
Surely, you can let me
be there for one of them.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.121
The King is trying to find his son
a wife, not a scullery maid!

13:35.560 --> 13:37.728
We must be gone!

13:41.080 --> 13:42.140
Stop it!

13:42.240 --> 13:43.340
Come on.

13:43.440 --> 13:44.766
Go!

13:45.880 --> 13:47.286
I wish...

13:50.320 --> 13:53.205
Look what I found. Here, take this.

13:53.640 --> 13:54.700
I'm not wearing that.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.260
- Why?
- It was my father's.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.180
You heard what she said.
This is all his fault.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.130
I want nothing to do with him.

14:01.520 --> 14:02.721
Beans?

14:05.280 --> 14:07.300
Oh, these must be the Witch's beans.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.820
We'll take them with us.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.420
- We?
- Yes.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.740
We? You're not coming.
It's not safe out there.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.180
I can help you!

14:14.280 --> 14:16.580
No, I can do this on my own.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.620
The spell is on my house
Only I can lift the spell

14:19.720 --> 14:21.620
No, no, the spell is on our house

14:21.720 --> 14:23.260
We must lift the spell together

14:23.360 --> 14:24.860
The spell is on our house

14:24.960 --> 14:27.020
Now, remind me,
what am I to return with?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.765
You don't remember?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.900
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood

14:32.000 --> 14:34.740
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

14:34.840 --> 14:37.380
The cow as white as milk
The cape as red as blood

14:37.480 --> 14:39.660
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as gold

14:39.760 --> 14:42.380
I still wish to go to the Festival

14:42.480 --> 14:44.700
But how am I ever to
get to the Festival?

14:44.800 --> 14:46.500
I know, I'll visit Mother's grave

14:46.600 --> 14:47.740
The grave at the willow tree

14:47.840 --> 14:50.500
And tell her I just want to go
To the King's Festival

14:50.600 --> 14:52.420
Into the woods, it's time to go

14:52.520 --> 14:54.300
It may be all in vain, you know

14:54.400 --> 14:57.940
Into the woods, but even so
I have to take the journey

14:58.040 --> 15:00.380
Into the woods, the path is straight
You know it well

15:00.480 --> 15:01.700
But who can tell?

15:01.800 --> 15:04.446
Into the woods to lift the spell

15:05.560 --> 15:08.127
Into the woods to visit Mother

15:09.080 --> 15:11.380
Into the woods to sell the cow

15:11.480 --> 15:13.340
To get the money

15:13.440 --> 15:15.563
To go to the Festival

15:16.280 --> 15:19.131
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house

15:19.960 --> 15:22.811
Into the woods, to Grandmother's house

15:23.440 --> 15:25.140
The way is clear

15:25.240 --> 15:26.860
The light is good

15:26.960 --> 15:30.340
I have no fear
Nor no one should

15:30.440 --> 15:33.900
The woods are just trees
The trees are just wood

15:34.000 --> 15:35.580
No need to be afraid there

15:35.680 --> 15:38.042
There's something in the glade there

15:45.000 --> 15:46.580
Into the woods without delay

15:46.680 --> 15:48.540
But careful not to lose the way

15:48.640 --> 15:50.180
Into the woods, who knows what may

15:50.280 --> 15:52.220
Be lurking on the journey

15:52.320 --> 15:53.820
Into the woods to get the thing

15:53.920 --> 15:55.724
That makes it worth the journeying

15:55.880 --> 15:57.340
Into the woods to see the King

15:57.440 --> 15:59.300
- To sell the cow
- To make the potion

15:59.400 --> 16:01.060
To see, to sell
To get, to bring

16:01.160 --> 16:02.780
To make, to lift
To go to the Festival

16:02.880 --> 16:03.860
Into the woods

16:03.960 --> 16:04.900
To see, to sell, to get, to bring

16:05.000 --> 16:06.500
- Into the woods
- To make, to lift, to go to the Festival

16:06.600 --> 16:10.060
Into the woods
Into the woods

16:10.160 --> 16:11.740
Into the woods
Then out of the woods

16:11.840 --> 16:13.540
To see, to sell
To get, to bring

16:13.640 --> 16:15.500
To make, to lift
To go to the Festival

16:15.600 --> 16:17.100
Into the woods
Then out of the woods

16:17.200 --> 16:19.402
And home before dark

16:30.960 --> 16:32.446
Deep within the woods

16:32.760 --> 16:36.760
Cinderella had planted
a branch at the grave of her mother.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.448
And she visited
there so often, and wept so much

16:40.720 --> 16:42.140
that her tears watered it

16:42.240 --> 16:45.444
until it had become a magnificent tree.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.090
I wish...

16:56.320 --> 16:59.524
What is it that you wish, child?

17:02.120 --> 17:04.900
Do you know what you wish?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.460
Are you certain what you wish
Is what you want?

17:08.560 --> 17:11.220
If you know what you want

17:11.319 --> 17:13.900
Then make a wish

17:14.000 --> 17:18.819
Ask the tree

17:18.920 --> 17:24.888
And you shall have your wish

17:51.000 --> 17:53.043
Thank you, Mother.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.740
On her path to Granny's,

18:17.840 --> 18:20.042
the little girl suddenly found herself

18:20.320 --> 18:23.205
in a very unusual part of the wood.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.287
Good day, young lady.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.969
Good day, Mr. Wolf.

18:38.520 --> 18:40.927
Whither away so hurriedly?

18:41.080 --> 18:42.930
To my grandmother's.

18:43.480 --> 18:46.420
And what might be in your basket?

18:46.520 --> 18:48.290
Some bread. For Grandmother.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.300
So she'll have something
good to make her strong.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.940
And where might your grandmother live?

18:54.040 --> 18:55.940
A good quarter of a league
further in the woods.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.446
Her house stands
inside a great oak tree.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.700
Look at that flesh
Pink and plump

19:21.800 --> 19:25.925
Hello, little girl

19:26.040 --> 19:29.660
Tender and fresh
Not one lump

19:29.760 --> 19:33.123
Hello, little girl

19:33.440 --> 19:36.849
This one's especially lush

19:37.440 --> 19:38.971
Delicious

19:40.440 --> 19:43.803
Hello, little girl
What's your rush?

19:44.120 --> 19:46.800
You're missing all the flowers

19:47.480 --> 19:50.180
The sun won't set for hours

19:50.280 --> 19:51.620
Take your time

19:51.720 --> 19:54.500
Mother said, "Straight ahead"
Not to delay or be misled

19:54.600 --> 19:58.340
But slow, little girl
Hark and hush

19:58.440 --> 20:01.405
The birds are singing sweetly

20:01.640 --> 20:03.968
You'll miss the birds completely

20:05.000 --> 20:08.860
You're traveling so fleetly

20:08.960 --> 20:12.020
Grandmother first
Then Miss Plump

20:12.120 --> 20:15.580
What a delectable couple

20:15.680 --> 20:18.820
Utter perfection
One brittle, one supple

20:18.920 --> 20:20.860
- One moment, my dear
- Mother said, "Come what may

20:20.960 --> 20:22.700
"Follow the path and never stray"

20:22.800 --> 20:25.900
Just so, little girl
Any path

20:26.000 --> 20:28.009
So many worth exploring

20:29.640 --> 20:33.020
Just one would be so boring

20:33.120 --> 20:34.731
And look what you're ignoring

20:36.800 --> 20:40.180
Think of those crisp, aging bones

20:40.280 --> 20:43.540
Then something fresh on the palate

20:43.640 --> 20:46.060
Think of that scrumptious carnality

20:46.160 --> 20:49.060
Twice in one day

20:49.160 --> 20:52.540
There's no possible way

20:52.640 --> 20:55.780
To describe what you feel

20:55.880 --> 20:59.050
When you're talking to your meal

21:03.360 --> 21:05.164
For Granny.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.700
Mother said not to stray

21:07.800 --> 21:10.765
Still, I suppose, a small delay

21:11.400 --> 21:13.728
Granny might like a fresh bouquet

21:15.800 --> 21:17.140
Goodbye, Mr. Wolf

21:17.240 --> 21:19.283
Goodbye, little girl

21:21.360 --> 21:25.042
And hello

21:46.520 --> 21:48.820
What are you waiting for? Get the cape!

21:48.920 --> 21:50.485
You frightened me!

21:51.080 --> 21:52.620
Get it, get it, get it, get it!

21:52.720 --> 21:54.300
How am I supposed to get it?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.780
You go up to the little thing,
and you take it!

21:56.880 --> 21:58.460
I can't just take a cloak
from a little girl.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.860
- Why don't you take it?
- It's the rules.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.100
Why do you think
I asked you to do it in the first place?

22:03.200 --> 22:06.768
I'm not allowed to touch
any of the objects.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.169
Get me what I need!

22:18.600 --> 22:19.801
Get me what I need!

22:30.440 --> 22:32.100
Hello there, little girl.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.180
Hello, Mr. Baker.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.980
Have you saved some
of those sweets for Granny?

22:36.080 --> 22:38.220
I ate all the sweets
and half a loaf of bread.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.900
So I see.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.860
Now, tell me, where did you
get that beautiful cape?

22:42.960 --> 22:45.606
- My granny made it for me.
- Is that so?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.020
I would love a red cape like that.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.731
You would look pretty foolish.

22:50.600 --> 22:53.140
I would, wouldn't I?

22:53.240 --> 22:54.180
May I take a look at it?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.140
- No!
- No, I need it badly.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.886
It's mine! Give it back!

22:59.080 --> 23:00.327
Give it back!

23:07.440 --> 23:10.420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure

23:10.520 --> 23:12.722
that you really loved that cape.

23:13.480 --> 23:16.020
Now off you go to Granny's,

23:16.120 --> 23:18.368
and be careful that
no wolf comes your way.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.842
I'd rather a wolf than you any day!

23:27.520 --> 23:30.007
This is hopeless!

23:32.320 --> 23:33.900
I'm never gonna find that red cape,

23:34.000 --> 23:37.540
or a yellow slipper and a golden cow.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.900
Oh, wait, is it a golden slipper
and a yellow cow?

23:40.000 --> 23:41.180
The cow as white as milk

23:41.280 --> 23:42.700
The cape as red as blood

23:42.800 --> 23:44.900
The hair as yellow as corn
The slipper as pure as...

23:45.000 --> 23:46.860
- What are you doing here?
- You forgot your scarf.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.900
You shouldn't be here.
It's not safe in these woods.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.420
- I want to help.
- No!

23:50.520 --> 23:52.020
- The spell is on my house
- Our house

23:52.120 --> 23:53.260
Only I can lift the spell

23:53.360 --> 23:54.900
- We must lift the spell together
- The spell is on my house

23:55.000 --> 23:56.201
The spell is on...

23:58.040 --> 24:01.084
A cow as white as...

24:01.680 --> 24:03.245
Milk.

24:03.360 --> 24:04.561
Go.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.940
- Hello there, young lad.
- Hello, sir.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.300
What might you be doing
with a cow in the middle of the forest?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.602
I was heading towards market,

24:14.840 --> 24:16.660
but I seem to have lost my way.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.140
"What are you planning on doing there?"
What are you planning on doing there?

24:20.240 --> 24:21.620
Sell my cow, sir.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.260
No less than five pounds.

24:23.360 --> 24:24.820
Five pounds?

24:24.920 --> 24:26.900
Where are we supposed
to get five pounds?

24:27.000 --> 24:30.488
She must be very generous
of milk to fetch five pounds.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.440
Yes, ma'am.

24:32.560 --> 24:36.082
And if you can't fetch that sum,
then what are you to do?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.485
I hadn't thought of that.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.620
This is all we have.

24:40.720 --> 24:41.820
Beans?

24:41.920 --> 24:44.660
Oh, no, we mustn't give up our beans!

24:44.760 --> 24:46.260
Well, if you feel that we must.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.980
Beans in exchange for my cow?

24:48.080 --> 24:50.340
Oh, no, son.
These are no ordinary beans.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.300
These beans, they carry magic.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.648
Magic? What kind of magic?

24:56.760 --> 24:58.086
Tell him.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.281
It's...

25:01.400 --> 25:03.820
- It's a magic that defies description.
- Yes.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.180
- How many beans?
- Six.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.300
- Five.
- Five.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.965
They're worth a pound each, at least.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.940
Could I buy my cow back someday?

25:11.040 --> 25:13.340
- Well... Possibly.
- Yes.

25:13.440 --> 25:15.180
So, yeah,

25:15.280 --> 25:17.140
it seems like we've made a fair trade.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.180
Okay.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.802
Here you go. There's one, two,

25:22.120 --> 25:25.540
three, four, five.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.500
All right, well, good luck,

25:27.600 --> 25:30.326
and pleasure doing business with you.

25:32.760 --> 25:35.500
One day, I'll buy you back.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.131
Promise.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.128
Take the cow and go home.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.140
I was just trying to help.

25:47.240 --> 25:48.860
Magic beans?

25:48.960 --> 25:50.660
We've no reason
to believe they're magic.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.860
Are we to dispel this
curse through deceit?

25:52.960 --> 25:55.020
No one would have given him
more for this creature.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.540
We did him a favor.
At least they'll have some food now.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.740
Five beans?

25:58.840 --> 26:00.740
- Do you want a child or not?
- Of course I do.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.540
We have one chance.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.060
Don't you see that? And if we fail...

26:05.160 --> 26:07.488
I'm not sure I'm cut out to be a father.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.220
Why would you say that?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.540
Because of my father.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.740
You're not him!

26:12.840 --> 26:14.201
I don't know.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.900
If you can't do this for yourself,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.328
can't you at least do it for me?

26:25.160 --> 26:27.900
Okay. Fine. But will you
take the cow and go home?

26:28.000 --> 26:29.740
I will find the rest of the things

26:29.840 --> 26:31.690
on my own.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.361
Stay.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.761
Rapunzel!

27:15.560 --> 27:17.762
Rapunzel!

27:18.400 --> 27:20.284
Let down your hair to me!

27:20.760 --> 27:23.042
Rapunzel?

27:24.280 --> 27:27.300
The old enchantress
had given the name Rapunzel

27:27.400 --> 27:30.604
to the child she had hidden away and
locked in a doorless tower.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.820
But little did she know

27:33.920 --> 27:36.620
that the girl's lilting voice
had caught the attention

27:36.720 --> 27:38.570
of a handsome prince.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.285
Rapunzel.

28:13.440 --> 28:15.820
Don't you look lovely today, my dear.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.690
Thank you, Mother.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.163
I brought your favorite.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.367
Blackberries.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.441
Fresh from the garden.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.700
As the little girl
approached her granny's oak tree,

28:33.800 --> 28:37.561
she was surprised to see
the door standing open.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.361
Oh, dear.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.003
How uneasy I feel.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.802
Perhaps it's all the sweets.

29:04.680 --> 29:06.380
Granny?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.842
Come in, my dearie.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.089
My, Grandmother.

29:25.560 --> 29:27.410
You're looking very strange.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.408
What big ears you have.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.401
The better to hear you with,

29:35.040 --> 29:36.685
my dear.

29:38.800 --> 29:41.300
And with a single bound

29:41.400 --> 29:43.568
the big, bad Wolf
had devoured the little girl.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.524
Well, it was a full day
of eating for both.

30:04.760 --> 30:07.440
Help! Get us out!

30:10.600 --> 30:12.802
I can't believe I just did that.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.921
Wait!

30:15.200 --> 30:17.340
Aren't you gonna help us
skin that beast?

30:17.440 --> 30:18.820
No, no. No thanks.

30:18.920 --> 30:21.260
What kind of hunter are you?

30:21.360 --> 30:23.020
I'm a baker.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.660
Wait a minute, I never thanked you!

30:24.760 --> 30:26.300
You need to be more careful, young lady.

30:26.400 --> 30:27.601
I'm sorry.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.489
I should have known better.

30:30.640 --> 30:34.811
Mother said, "Straight ahead"
Not to delay or be misled

30:36.120 --> 30:38.340
I should have heeded her advice

30:38.440 --> 30:41.928
But he seemed so nice

30:42.960 --> 30:46.620
And he showed me things
Many beautiful things

30:46.720 --> 30:50.300
That I hadn't thought to explore

30:50.400 --> 30:53.809
They were off my path
So I never had dared

30:53.920 --> 30:55.820
I had been so careful

30:55.920 --> 30:57.780
I never had cared

30:57.880 --> 31:01.926
And he made me feel excited
Well, excited and scared

31:04.120 --> 31:07.900
When he said, "Come in"
With that sickening grin

31:08.000 --> 31:10.806
How could I know what was in store?

31:11.320 --> 31:15.020
Once his teeth were bared,
though I really got scared

31:15.120 --> 31:18.210
Well, excited and scared

31:20.600 --> 31:22.820
But he drew me close

31:22.920 --> 31:24.180
And he swallowed me down

31:24.280 --> 31:26.020
Down a dark, slimy path

31:26.120 --> 31:28.721
Where lie secrets
That I never want to know

31:30.480 --> 31:32.420
And when everything familiar

31:32.520 --> 31:34.380
Seemed to disappear forever

31:34.480 --> 31:37.968
At the end of the path
Was Granny once again

31:41.280 --> 31:45.405
So we lay in the dark
Till you came and set us free

31:49.440 --> 31:51.005
And you brought us to the light

31:51.320 --> 31:54.740
And we're back at the start

31:54.840 --> 31:58.420
And I know things now
Many valuable things

31:58.520 --> 32:02.060
That I hadn't known before

32:02.160 --> 32:04.220
Do not put your faith

32:04.320 --> 32:05.780
In a cape and a hood

32:05.880 --> 32:09.420
They will not protect you
The way that they should

32:09.520 --> 32:11.260
And take extra care with strangers

32:11.360 --> 32:13.540
Even flowers have their dangers

32:13.640 --> 32:15.220
And though scary is exciting

32:15.320 --> 32:18.364
Nice is different than good

32:20.040 --> 32:22.402
Mr. Baker, you saved our lives.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.247
Here.

32:26.080 --> 32:27.580
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

32:27.680 --> 32:30.580
Maybe Granny will make me another
one out of the skins of that wolf.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.291
Thank you.

32:32.520 --> 32:34.051
Thank you!

32:36.880 --> 32:38.660
Now I know: don't be scared

32:38.760 --> 32:41.566
Granny is right, just be prepared

32:41.760 --> 32:43.962
Isn't it nice to know a lot

32:45.720 --> 32:47.922
And a little bit

32:48.920 --> 32:50.121
Not

32:51.280 --> 32:53.140
How could you do this?

32:53.240 --> 32:55.940
What sort of boy exchanges
a cow for beans?

32:56.040 --> 32:57.740
But they're magic. The man said.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.340
Get your head out of the clouds, Jack!

33:00.440 --> 33:01.460
Mother, no!

33:01.560 --> 33:03.140
Go on, get in there!

33:03.240 --> 33:06.660
You and your worthless
adventures, Jack! Will you never learn?

33:06.760 --> 33:09.611
To bed without supper for you!

33:11.440 --> 33:12.641
Beans!

33:34.040 --> 33:36.180
The first night of the Festival Ball

33:36.280 --> 33:38.220
brought Cinderella her wish.

33:38.320 --> 33:40.780
The Prince danced only with her,

33:40.880 --> 33:44.641
till he turned,
and she had slipped away.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.006
That way!

34:00.240 --> 34:01.646
Quickly!

34:13.679 --> 34:16.645
I must find that girl.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.580
- Are you all right, miss?
- Yes.

34:38.679 --> 34:40.020
I just need to catch my breath.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.580
Oh, what a beautiful gown!

34:41.679 --> 34:43.219
Were you at the King's Festival?

34:43.320 --> 34:44.601
Yes.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.699
Aren't you the lucky one.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.739
Why ever are you in
the woods at this hour?

34:48.840 --> 34:50.087
This way!

34:50.840 --> 34:52.246
Please don't let them
know that I'm here.

34:58.320 --> 34:59.900
Oh, my God.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.443
Have you seen a beautiful young
woman in a ball gown pass through?

35:04.720 --> 35:06.380
I don't think so, sir.

35:06.480 --> 35:08.420
If I may, My Lord,
I think I see her over there!

35:08.520 --> 35:09.926
Onward!

35:13.680 --> 35:16.360
I've never lied to royalty before.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.420
I've never anything to royalty before!

35:18.520 --> 35:19.940
Thank you.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.608
If a prince were looking for me,
I certainly wouldn't hide.

35:30.000 --> 35:31.940
What brings you here,

35:32.040 --> 35:33.605
and with a cow?

35:35.880 --> 35:38.420
Well, my husband's
somewhere in the woods.

35:38.520 --> 35:41.246
He's undoing a spell.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.087
Yes.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.848
But tell me, the Prince,
what was he like?

35:51.080 --> 35:52.740
He's a very nice prince

35:52.840 --> 35:53.820
And?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.100
And...

35:55.200 --> 35:56.940
It's a very nice ball

35:57.040 --> 35:58.020
And?

35:58.120 --> 35:59.100
And...

35:59.200 --> 36:00.700
When I entered, they trumpeted

36:00.800 --> 36:02.460
And? The Prince?

36:02.560 --> 36:03.700
- Oh, the Prince
- Yes, the Prince

36:03.800 --> 36:04.940
Well, he's tall

36:05.040 --> 36:06.401
Is that all?

36:06.560 --> 36:07.940
Did you dance? Is he charming?

36:08.040 --> 36:09.940
They say that he's charming

36:10.040 --> 36:12.140
We did nothing but dance

36:12.240 --> 36:13.780
Yes?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.300
- And?
- And it made a nice change

36:15.400 --> 36:16.340
No, the Prince

36:16.440 --> 36:18.180
- Oh, the Prince
- Yes, the Prince

36:18.280 --> 36:20.780
He has charm for a prince, I guess

36:20.880 --> 36:22.380
You guess?

36:22.480 --> 36:25.340
I don't meet a wide range

36:25.440 --> 36:28.620
And it's all very strange

36:28.720 --> 36:30.922
But why would you run away?

36:32.560 --> 36:34.540
It's not quite what I expected.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.620
What? Princes and castles and gowns?

36:37.720 --> 36:39.900
I have no experience with those things.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.140
But you will return to
the Festival tomorrow eve?

36:42.240 --> 36:43.460
Yes.

36:43.560 --> 36:44.886
No.

36:45.280 --> 36:46.340
I don't know.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.971
You don't know?

36:48.200 --> 36:50.860
What I wouldn't give
to be in your shoes.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.128
Well, your slippers.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.860
As pure as gold?

36:54.960 --> 36:55.900
I must get home.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.361
No, wait. I need your shoes!

36:59.480 --> 37:00.841
Milky-White!

37:01.800 --> 37:03.900
One midnight gone!

37:04.000 --> 37:05.180
Already?

37:05.280 --> 37:06.686
Get the cow!

37:50.240 --> 37:51.885
Mr. Baker! Mr. Baker!

37:53.040 --> 37:55.340
Good fortune! Good fortune, sir!

37:55.440 --> 37:58.166
Look what I have! Five gold pieces!

37:58.360 --> 38:00.403
How would you come by five gold pieces?

38:01.680 --> 38:05.930
There are giants in the sky

38:06.040 --> 38:10.609
There are big, tall,
terrible giants in the sky

38:14.720 --> 38:16.500
When you're way up high
And you look below

38:16.600 --> 38:18.460
At the world you've left
And the things you know

38:18.560 --> 38:20.620
Little more than a glance
Is enough to show you

38:20.720 --> 38:22.763
Just how small you are

38:24.200 --> 38:26.300
When you're way up high
And you're on your own

38:26.400 --> 38:27.940
In a world like none
That you've ever known

38:28.040 --> 38:29.860
Where the sky is lead
And the earth is stone

38:29.960 --> 38:33.620
You're free to do
Whatever pleases you

38:33.720 --> 38:35.620
Exploring things you'd never dare

38:35.720 --> 38:37.780
'Cause you don't care
When suddenly there's

38:37.880 --> 38:42.449
A big, tall, terrible giant at the door

38:42.720 --> 38:43.921
A giant?

38:45.280 --> 38:49.220
A big, tall, terrible lady giant

38:49.320 --> 38:52.285
Sweeping the floor

38:52.640 --> 38:56.300
And she gives you food
And she gives you rest

38:56.400 --> 39:00.060
And she draws you close
To her giant breast

39:00.160 --> 39:01.860
And you know things now

39:01.960 --> 39:06.324
That you never knew before

39:06.920 --> 39:09.122
Not till the sky

39:11.360 --> 39:13.180
Only just when you've made
A friend and all

39:13.280 --> 39:15.060
And you know she's big
But you don't feel small

39:15.160 --> 39:16.940
Someone bigger than her
Comes along the hall

39:17.040 --> 39:19.322
To swallow you for lunch

39:20.760 --> 39:22.540
And your heart is lead
And your stomach stone

39:22.640 --> 39:26.020
And you're really scared
Being all alone

39:26.120 --> 39:28.020
And it's then that you miss
All the things you've known

39:28.120 --> 39:29.860
And the world you've left
And the little you own

39:29.960 --> 39:33.380
The fun is done
You steal what you can and run

39:33.480 --> 39:35.380
And you scramble down
And you look below

39:35.480 --> 39:37.540
And the world you know
Begins to grow

39:37.640 --> 39:44.007
The roof, the house
And your mother at the door

39:44.560 --> 39:45.620
The roof

39:45.720 --> 39:48.740
The house
And the world you never

39:48.840 --> 39:51.780
Thought to explore

39:51.880 --> 39:55.540
And you think of
All of the things you've seen

39:55.640 --> 39:59.561
And you wish that
You could live in between

39:59.800 --> 40:00.940
And you're back again

40:01.040 --> 40:05.928
Only different than before

40:06.200 --> 40:08.980
After the sky

40:09.080 --> 40:12.980
There are giants in the sky

40:13.080 --> 40:15.980
There are big, tall, terrible
Awesome, scary

40:16.080 --> 40:18.580
Wonderful giants

40:18.680 --> 40:22.123
In the sky

40:23.680 --> 40:26.611
There's your money, sir.
Five gold pieces.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.970
Where's my Milky-White?

40:31.080 --> 40:32.820
Milky-White is at home with my wife.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.420
- Let's go find them.
- No, wait.

40:34.520 --> 40:35.900
I'm not sure I want to sell.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.260
But you said I could buy her back.

40:37.360 --> 40:38.940
- Do you want more money?
- No.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.540
You keep that, I'll fetch some more.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.860
I'll just go back up the beanstalk.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.300
Wait!

40:43.400 --> 40:45.011
Wait! Wait!

40:45.400 --> 40:46.860
Wait!

40:46.960 --> 40:49.100
Wait! Wait!

40:49.200 --> 40:51.402
I said wait!

40:53.040 --> 40:54.730
What are you doing here?

40:55.080 --> 40:56.725
Well...

40:57.200 --> 40:58.460
I see you got the cape!

40:58.560 --> 40:59.540
Yes, I've got the cape.

40:59.640 --> 41:00.980
- Only two items left.
- Three.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.260
Two. We've the cape and the cow.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.403
You've got the cape!

41:04.640 --> 41:06.763
What have you done with the cow?

41:07.280 --> 41:09.100
- She ran away.
- What?

41:09.200 --> 41:11.620
I never even reached home.
I've been looking for her all night.

41:11.720 --> 41:12.921
How could you?

41:13.560 --> 41:15.300
Well, she might
just as easily have run away from you.

41:15.400 --> 41:16.780
- Yeah, but she didn't.
- Yeah, but she might have done.

41:16.880 --> 41:17.900
- But she didn't.
- But she might have done!

41:18.000 --> 41:19.281
But she didn't!

41:20.520 --> 41:21.900
Who cares?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.851
Cow's gone! Get it back! Get it back!

41:25.320 --> 41:27.660
We were just about to do that,

41:27.760 --> 41:29.660
but here, in the meantime,
we've got this.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.611
Get away from me with that, you fool!

41:32.760 --> 41:35.220
I can't touch it, remember?

41:35.320 --> 41:37.124
Right. No, I forgot.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.980
By midnight tomorrow bring me the items,

41:40.080 --> 41:43.602
or that child you wish for will
never see the light of day!

41:48.920 --> 41:51.202
I don't like that woman.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.500
I'm sorry I lost the cow.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.211
I shouldn't have yelled.

42:01.600 --> 42:03.020
Will you go back to the village?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.820
I will make things right.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.540
And we can carry on with our lives.

42:06.640 --> 42:09.260
No more witches or dim-witted boys

42:09.360 --> 42:10.740
or hungry little girls.

42:10.840 --> 42:12.180
Will you go?

42:12.280 --> 42:13.641
Please.

42:15.280 --> 42:16.481
Go.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.700
Good brother!

42:37.800 --> 42:40.620
I was wondering where you had gone.
I've been searching all night for her.

42:40.720 --> 42:41.700
Her?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.540
The beautiful one
I danced the evening with.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.940
Where did she go?

42:46.040 --> 42:47.540
Disappeared,

42:47.640 --> 42:49.820
like the fine morning mist.

42:49.920 --> 42:51.060
She was lovely?

42:51.160 --> 42:52.380
The loveliest.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.444
I'm not certain of that.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.521
I must confess, I, too,
have found a lovely maiden.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.460
She lives here, in the woods.

43:00.560 --> 43:01.900
- In the woods?
- Yes!

43:02.000 --> 43:04.660
On top of a tall tower
that has no doors or stairs.

43:04.760 --> 43:05.961
Where?

43:06.080 --> 43:07.740
Two leagues from here, due east,

43:07.840 --> 43:09.580
just beyond the mossy knoll
near the rose thickets.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.370
And how do you manage a visit?

43:11.680 --> 43:13.140
I stand beneath her tower

43:13.240 --> 43:16.780
and I say, "Rapunzel!
Rapunzel, let down your hair to me."

43:16.880 --> 43:18.820
And she lowers the longest,

43:18.920 --> 43:20.260
most beautiful head of hair,

43:20.360 --> 43:21.607
yellow as corn,

43:21.920 --> 43:23.260
which I climb.

43:23.360 --> 43:24.660
Rapunzel?

43:24.760 --> 43:26.140
- Rapunzel?
- Yeah.

43:26.240 --> 43:28.260
What kind of name is that? You jest!

43:28.360 --> 43:30.420
Never heard of such a thing.

43:30.520 --> 43:32.100
I speak the truth!

43:32.200 --> 43:33.580
She's as true as your maiden.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.803
A maiden running from a prince?

43:35.960 --> 43:38.322
None would run from us.

43:41.200 --> 43:42.640
Yet one has.

43:49.880 --> 43:53.540
Did I abuse her?
Or show her disdain?

43:53.640 --> 43:56.969
Why does she run from me?

43:57.480 --> 44:00.780
If I should lose her
How shall I regain

44:00.880 --> 44:04.084
The heart she has won from me?

44:04.880 --> 44:06.980
Agony

44:07.080 --> 44:10.523
Beyond power of speech

44:10.800 --> 44:13.480
When the one thing you want

44:14.280 --> 44:18.500
Is the only thing out of your reach

44:18.600 --> 44:20.340
High in her tower

44:20.440 --> 44:21.980
She sits by the hour

44:22.080 --> 44:25.124
Maintaining her hair

44:25.920 --> 44:29.340
Blithe and becoming
And frequently humming

44:29.440 --> 44:31.449
A lighthearted air

44:35.080 --> 44:37.140
Agony

44:37.240 --> 44:39.329
Far more painful than yours

44:40.800 --> 44:44.209
When you know she would go with you

44:44.600 --> 44:47.820
If there only were doors

44:47.920 --> 44:50.340
Agony

44:50.440 --> 44:54.247
Oh, the torture they teach

44:55.320 --> 44:56.900
What's as intriguing

44:57.000 --> 44:58.700
Or half so fatiguing

44:58.800 --> 45:01.571
As what's out of reach?

45:01.680 --> 45:03.860
Am I not sensitive

45:03.960 --> 45:06.220
Clever, well-mannered, considerate

45:06.320 --> 45:09.340
Passionate, charming
As kind as I'm handsome

45:09.440 --> 45:11.580
And heir to a throne?

45:11.680 --> 45:14.020
You are everything
maidens could wish for

45:14.120 --> 45:15.740
- Then why no?
- Do I know?

45:15.840 --> 45:18.202
The girl must be mad

45:19.160 --> 45:22.603
You know nothing of madness

45:23.800 --> 45:27.060
Till you're climbing her hair
And you see her up there

45:27.160 --> 45:30.921
As you're nearing her
All the while hearing her

45:37.240 --> 45:38.220
Agony

45:38.320 --> 45:39.300
- Misery
- Woe

45:39.400 --> 45:42.900
Though it's different for each

45:43.000 --> 45:44.900
Always ten steps behind

45:45.000 --> 45:46.660
Always ten feet below

45:46.760 --> 45:50.060
And she's just out of reach

45:50.160 --> 45:52.140
Agony

45:52.240 --> 45:55.922
That can cut like a knife

45:57.440 --> 46:00.086
I must have her

46:00.720 --> 46:04.606
To wife

46:47.240 --> 46:49.940
Rapunzel, Rapunzel.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.686
Let down your hair to me.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.127
Is that you at this hour, my Prince?

47:02.440 --> 47:03.641
Yes.

47:32.600 --> 47:34.165
Excuse me for this.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.860
As the Baker's wife
bolted from the tower,

47:48.960 --> 47:51.460
the second night of the Festival
was thrown into chaos...

47:51.560 --> 47:52.540
Stop!

47:52.640 --> 47:55.525
...when Cinderella, once again,
ran from the Prince.

48:10.720 --> 48:11.780
What are you doing?

48:11.880 --> 48:14.526
So sorry, I need your shoe.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.286
I see her over there!

48:25.560 --> 48:27.380
Who is she? Where did she go?

48:27.480 --> 48:28.780
I have no idea, sir.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.540
Don't play the fool, woman.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.620
No, I was trying
to hold her here for you.

48:32.720 --> 48:33.940
I can capture my own damsel,

48:34.040 --> 48:35.241
- thank you.
- Yes, of course.

48:35.360 --> 48:37.820
There's no sign of her, my liege.
Well, what are you waiting for?

48:37.920 --> 48:39.963
See if you can find her. Go!

48:42.760 --> 48:45.645
The woods can be a dangerous place.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.921
On!

49:03.840 --> 49:07.089
I hope that skinny girl
isn't there tomorrow night.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.220
I mean, who was that girl?

49:09.320 --> 49:11.100
Please, if you would be so kind,

49:11.200 --> 49:13.260
may I compare this ear
of corn to your hair?

49:13.360 --> 49:14.925
You savage!

49:17.320 --> 49:18.260
Mongrel!

49:18.360 --> 49:20.324
He is revolting!

49:34.760 --> 49:35.961
Milky-White!

49:47.240 --> 49:48.660
- I thought you were returning home!
- It's you!

49:48.760 --> 49:49.820
You've got the cow!

49:49.920 --> 49:51.380
Yes, I've got the cow.
We've two of the four.

49:51.480 --> 49:52.980
- No, three.
- Two.

49:53.080 --> 49:55.760
Three! Compare this to your corn.

49:57.680 --> 49:58.700
Where did you find it?

49:58.800 --> 50:00.580
Just pulled it from a maiden in a tower.

50:00.680 --> 50:01.740
- Three!
- Three.

50:01.840 --> 50:03.660
And I almost had the fourth,
but she got away.

50:03.760 --> 50:04.900
We've one entire day left.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.820
Surely we can locate
the slipper by then.

50:06.920 --> 50:07.980
We?

50:08.080 --> 50:11.090
Do you mean
you're going to let me stay with you?

50:15.320 --> 50:17.966
Perhaps it will take two of us
to have this child.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.500
You've changed
You're daring

50:22.600 --> 50:25.007
You're different in the woods

50:25.760 --> 50:29.020
More sure
More sharing

50:29.120 --> 50:31.800
You're getting us through the woods

50:32.280 --> 50:35.340
If you could see

50:35.440 --> 50:38.689
You're not the man who started

50:38.960 --> 50:42.020
And much more open-hearted

50:42.120 --> 50:45.483
Than I knew you to be

50:45.720 --> 50:46.780
It takes two

50:46.880 --> 50:49.860
I thought one was enough
It's not true

50:49.960 --> 50:53.020
It takes two of us
You came through

50:53.120 --> 50:56.060
When the journey was rough
It took you

50:56.160 --> 50:59.220
It took two of us
It takes care

50:59.320 --> 51:03.980
It takes patience and fear and despair
To change

51:04.080 --> 51:06.380
Though you swear
To change

51:06.480 --> 51:08.364
Who can tell if you do?

51:09.000 --> 51:10.201
It takes two

51:10.520 --> 51:12.140
You've changed

51:12.240 --> 51:16.540
You're thriving
There's something about the woods

51:16.640 --> 51:19.820
Not just surviving

51:19.920 --> 51:23.060
You're blossoming in the woods

51:23.160 --> 51:26.060
At home I'd fear

51:26.160 --> 51:29.260
We'd stay the same forever

51:29.360 --> 51:32.460
And then, out here

51:32.560 --> 51:35.660
You're passionate, charming
Considerate, clever

51:35.760 --> 51:36.961
It takes one

51:37.280 --> 51:40.051
To begin
But then once you've begun

51:40.360 --> 51:42.927
It takes two of you
It's no fun

51:43.400 --> 51:46.500
But what needs to be done
You can do

51:46.600 --> 51:48.140
When there's two of you

51:48.240 --> 51:50.090
If I dare

51:50.440 --> 51:54.247
It's because I'm becoming
Aware of us

51:54.360 --> 51:56.608
As a pair of us

51:56.720 --> 51:59.400
Each accepting a share

51:59.600 --> 52:00.780
Of what's there

52:00.880 --> 52:02.180
We've changed

52:02.280 --> 52:06.644
We're strangers
I'm meeting you in the woods

52:07.080 --> 52:10.260
Who minds what dangers?

52:10.360 --> 52:12.927
I know we'll get past the woods

52:13.640 --> 52:16.300
And once we're past

52:16.400 --> 52:19.460
Let's hope the changes last

52:19.560 --> 52:20.980
Beyond woods

52:21.080 --> 52:23.980
Beyond witches and slippers and hoods

52:24.080 --> 52:27.140
Just the two of us
Beyond lies

52:27.240 --> 52:30.180
Safe at home with our beautiful prize

52:30.280 --> 52:33.180
Just the few of us
It takes trust

52:33.280 --> 52:36.620
It takes just a bit more
And we're done

52:36.720 --> 52:37.980
We want four, we had none

52:38.080 --> 52:41.020
We've got three
We need one

52:41.120 --> 52:42.321
It takes two

52:47.000 --> 52:49.089
Stop it! Stop my egg!

52:51.680 --> 52:53.580
Oh, brilliant! My Milky-White!

52:53.680 --> 52:54.820
I've missed you so much!

52:54.920 --> 52:56.140
Where did you get this?

52:56.240 --> 52:57.380
From the giant's hen.

52:57.480 --> 53:00.180
A golden egg!
I've never seen a golden egg before.

53:00.280 --> 53:02.260
And you can have it,
along with the five gold pieces.

53:02.360 --> 53:03.500
What five gold pieces?

53:03.600 --> 53:04.660
Now I'm taking my cow.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.220
No! I do not wish to sell.

53:06.320 --> 53:07.380
But you took the five gold pieces.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.100
- I didn't take, you gave.
- But you said I could have my cow!

53:09.200 --> 53:10.180
Where are the five gold pieces?

53:10.280 --> 53:12.323
I never said you could.
I said you might.

53:12.640 --> 53:13.900
You would take money before a child?

53:14.000 --> 53:15.565
No, no, no, it's not like that.
It wasn't like that.

53:16.520 --> 53:17.500
It's not like I've done a deal with him.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.860
- How could you do that?
- It all just happened so fast.

53:18.960 --> 53:20.161
Milky-White!

53:26.000 --> 53:27.060
Milky-White is dead.

53:27.160 --> 53:28.361
What?

53:30.200 --> 53:32.641
Two midnights gone!

53:44.040 --> 53:45.220
As dawn broke

53:45.320 --> 53:47.940
the Baker and his wife
had but one day left

53:48.040 --> 53:50.163
to reverse the Witch's curse.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.060
As for Rapunzel's Prince,

53:52.160 --> 53:54.681
he returned yet again
to the forbidden tower.

54:02.320 --> 54:04.648
No! Bad idea!

54:05.520 --> 54:06.900
Are you all right?

54:07.000 --> 54:10.044
Yep, yeah. Feel fine. Fine.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.780
What did I clearly say?
Children must listen

54:46.880 --> 54:48.700
No! Please!

54:48.800 --> 54:51.020
What were you not to do?
Children must see

54:51.120 --> 54:52.321
No!

54:52.600 --> 54:55.180
And learn

54:55.280 --> 54:57.164
Why could you not obey?

54:57.400 --> 54:58.806
Children should listen

54:59.640 --> 55:01.780
What have I been to you?

55:01.880 --> 55:03.780
What would you have me be?

55:03.880 --> 55:08.005
Handsome like a prince?

55:09.640 --> 55:13.300
But I am old
I am ugly

55:13.400 --> 55:15.340
- I embarrass you
- No!

55:15.440 --> 55:16.660
You are ashamed of me

55:16.760 --> 55:17.780
No!

55:17.880 --> 55:20.162
You are ashamed

55:22.480 --> 55:26.162
You don't understand

55:33.400 --> 55:37.047
I'm no longer a child.
I wish to see the world.

55:41.160 --> 55:46.366
Don't you know what's
out there in the world?

55:48.440 --> 55:53.646
Someone has to shield you from the world

55:54.760 --> 55:57.804
Stay with me

56:02.680 --> 56:07.886
Princes wait there in the world,
it's true

56:09.480 --> 56:14.686
Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too

56:15.200 --> 56:17.926
Stay at home

56:18.560 --> 56:21.620
I am home

56:21.720 --> 56:25.420
Who out there

56:25.520 --> 56:29.540
Could love you more than I?

56:29.640 --> 56:32.220
What out there

56:32.320 --> 56:36.740
That I cannot supply?

56:36.840 --> 56:39.771
Stay with me

56:43.360 --> 56:46.060
Stay with me

56:46.160 --> 56:51.366
The world is dark and wild

56:55.000 --> 56:57.780
Stay a child

56:57.880 --> 57:03.086
While you can be a child

57:06.720 --> 57:10.049
With me

57:19.440 --> 57:21.722
I gave you protection

57:22.240 --> 57:24.420
and yet you disobeyed me.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.721
No.

57:26.720 --> 57:30.242
Your prince will never
lay eyes on you again.

57:30.360 --> 57:32.580
He will never lay eyes
on anything again.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.245
What did you do to him?

57:34.960 --> 57:36.660
It doesn't matter,

57:36.760 --> 57:39.008
because where you're going

57:39.120 --> 57:41.660
no one will ever see you again!

57:41.760 --> 57:44.008
No! No!

57:45.760 --> 57:47.610
No!

58:00.880 --> 58:01.980
Hey, there. N ice cape.

58:02.080 --> 58:04.900
Stay away from my cape,
or I'll slash you into a thousand bits!

58:05.000 --> 58:06.380
I don't want it.

58:06.480 --> 58:08.460
- Where did you get it?
- My granny made it for me

58:08.560 --> 58:10.300
from a wolf that attacked us.

58:10.400 --> 58:12.580
And she gave me
this beautiful knife for protection.

58:12.680 --> 58:14.928
Look what I have. A golden egg.

58:16.880 --> 58:18.060
Where did you get that egg?

58:18.160 --> 58:21.603
I stole a hen that lays golden eggs
from the kingdom of the giant.

58:21.920 --> 58:23.260
I don't believe you.

58:23.360 --> 58:25.980
It's true. And you should see
the giant's toy harp.

58:26.080 --> 58:28.500
It plays the most beautiful tunes
without you even having to touch it.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.780
Of course it does.

58:29.880 --> 58:31.660
Why don't you go up
to the kingdom right now,

58:31.760 --> 58:33.420
bring it back and show it to me?

58:33.520 --> 58:35.140
- I could.
- You could not.

58:35.240 --> 58:36.260
I could!

58:36.360 --> 58:37.500
You could not, Mr. Liar!

58:37.600 --> 58:39.882
I'm not a liar.
I'll get that harp, you'll see!

58:41.760 --> 58:43.660
Jack took the little girl's dare,

58:43.760 --> 58:45.140
and before he knew it

58:45.240 --> 58:46.805
found himself fleeing from a giant.

58:49.280 --> 58:52.768
Bring back my harp!

58:56.960 --> 59:00.403
I'll grind your bones!

59:10.640 --> 59:13.100
Okay, we don't have much time left.
I don't know where to start.

59:13.200 --> 59:15.820
You can start by buying a new cow
with the money you took from the boy.

59:15.920 --> 59:17.540
Right, okay, and where do I buy a cow?

59:17.640 --> 59:19.940
Just go to the next village.
I'm sure you'll find a cow there.

59:20.040 --> 59:22.220
Okay, and what are you going to do?
I'm going to get the slipper.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.180
- The yellow slipper?
- The golden slipper!

59:24.280 --> 59:26.841
The golden slipper, that's right.
Where are you going to find it?

59:27.560 --> 59:29.900
I've met a maiden, these two
previous nights, with golden slippers.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.964
- Do you think you can get one?
- I'm sure of it.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.340
Wait.

59:37.440 --> 59:39.369
Why are we always separating?

59:39.480 --> 59:42.206
Because we have to,
if we're going to be together.

59:53.600 --> 59:55.006
What?

59:56.680 --> 59:58.380
The entire kingdom shook

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.820
when the beanstalk came crashing down,

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.849
killing the giant.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.940
As for the indecisive Cinderella,

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.940
she fled from the Prince.

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.580
Again.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.006
After her!

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.927
He's a very smart prince

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.602
He's a prince who prepares

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.931
Knowing this time I'd run from him

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.620
He spread pitch on the stairs

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:58.140
And I'm caught unawares

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.444
Well, it means that he cares

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.966
This is more than just malice

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.380
Better stop and take stock

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.286
While you're standing here stuck
On the steps of the palace

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:15.287
All right, what do you want?

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.820
Have to make a decision

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.500
Why not stay and be caught?
Should I give that a thought?

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.121
What would be his response?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.180
But then what if he knew who I am

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.962
When I know that I'm not
What he thinks that he wants?

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:31.820
Or then, what if I am

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.300
What a prince would envision?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.820
But then how can you know
Who you are till you know

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.100
What you want, which I don't?

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.460
So then, which do you pick?

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.340
Where you're safe
out of sight and yourself

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.007
But where everything's wrong?

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:49.129
Or where everything's right
But you know that you'll never belong?

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.300
And whichever you pick
Do it quick

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.241
'Cause you're starting to stick
To the steps of the palace

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.180
It's my first big decision

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.820
The choice isn't easy to make

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.220
To arrive at a ball
Is exciting and all

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.780
Once you're there, though, it's scary

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.220
And it's fun to deceive
When you know you can leave

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.780
But you have to be wary

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.060
There's a lot that's at stake

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.340
But I've stalled long enough

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:16.140
'Cause I'm still standing stuck
In the stuff on these steps

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.700
Better run along home

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.140
And avoid the collision

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.740
Though at home, they don't care
I'll be better off there

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.180
Where there's nothing to choose

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.500
So there's nothing to lose

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.340
So I'll pry up my shoes

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:34.740
Wait, though, thinking it through

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.060
Things don't have to collide

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:41.046
I know what my decision is
Which is not to decide

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.820
I'll just leave him a clue

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.690
For example

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.420
A shoe

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.860
And then see what he'll do

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:53.401
Now it's he and not you
Who'll be stuck with a shoe

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.820
In a stew

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.167
In the goo

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:00.180
And I've learned something, too

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.528
Something I never knew

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:10.366
On the steps of the palace

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.209
With me! Quick, men!

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.765
She mustn't get away!

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.851
The Ball is over. Send everyone home.

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.700
And the Princess?

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.446
She won't get far with one shoe.

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:52.100
- Don't come any closer to me!
- Please, just stop.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.420
Just hear me out.

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.900
- You have attacked me once before.
- I didn't attack you...

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.940
I attacked your shoe. I need it.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.528
Look. I have a magic bean
in exchange for it.

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.767
Magic bean?

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.127
Yes.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.820
Nonsense!

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.121
No!

01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:10.404
Wait, please! I haven't much time!

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.883
I need that shoe, to have a child.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.820
That makes no sense!

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.500
Does it make sense
that you're running from a prince?

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.580
- Stop! You there, stop!
- I must go!

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.609
Here, take my shoes. You'll run faster.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:23.180
Here.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.820
- Thank you!
- Stop!

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.300
Thank you, thank you.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.860
What is that you have in your hand?

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.500
Nothing. It's mine.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.500
Lying will cost you your life.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:34.700
I don't care if it
costs me my life, just get off!

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:36.081
You will pay for this!

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.180
No!

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:41.980
Sire, I have succeeded
in obtaining the other slipper.

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.860
Please, kind Prince,
let me have the slipper,

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.660
and all will come to a happy end.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.100
Step back, peon!

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.767
Do as she says, Steward!
We only need one.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.940
Thank you.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:57.460
We must search immediately
for the maiden who fits this slipper.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.660
Tonight?

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.700
This very night! On!

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.001
Forward!

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:11.740
And in her haste,

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.700
the Baker's wife took no notice

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.129
of a second beanstalk climbing skyward.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.700
Let it be known that His Royal
Highness, the Crown Prince,

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.660
will be visiting every house
in this village tonight.

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:26.020
All young maidens are hereby commanded

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:30.211
to remain in their home
until visited by the Royal Guard.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.980
Open the gates.

01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.567
His Royal Highness approaches.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:41.407
The Prince wishes to meet all the
young maidens of this house.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.407
All young maidens

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.406
prepare to meet the Prince.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.020
As the Prince anxiously waited,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:56.731
the Stepmother took matters,

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.244
and Florinda's foot, into her own hands.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:02.620
- Careful, my toe
- Darling, I know

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.780
- What'll we do?
- It'll have to go

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:06.940
But when you're his bride
You can sit or ride

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.720
You'll never need to walk

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.540
Minus one toe,

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.060
Florinda mounted the Prince's horse

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:24.443
unaware of the blood
dripping from the slipper.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.044
Lucinda was next.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.180
Why won't it fit?

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:41.300
Darling, be still

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.260
Cut off a bit of the heel and it will

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:45.420
And when you're his wife
You'll have such a life

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.927
You'll never need to walk

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.580
Minus a heel,

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.484
Lucinda did her best
to swallow the pain.

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.404
It's a perfect fit, Your Highness.

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.780
Have you no other daughters?

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:20.700
Only a little, stunted kitchen wench,

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.540
which her late father left behind.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.820
But she cannot present herself.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.485
She is too dirty.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:03.808
I would recognize
these beautiful eyes anywhere.

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.206
You.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.206
You are my true bride.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.201
Get down. Get down.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.365
As punishment for their cruelty,

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.966
Cinderella's birds
swooped down upon the stepsisters

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.881
and blinded them.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.100
As for Rapunzel,

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.620
the Witch had banished her to a swamp

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.924
in the darkest depths of the forest.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:00.885
Rapunzel?

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.729
Rapunzel!

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:07.420
Rapunzel!

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.926
My darling?

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:10.520
My darling!

01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:12.441
I'm here!

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.211
Rapunzel?

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.451
Rapunzel!

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.979
Is that you?

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.760
I'm blind, I can't see.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.442
How could she do this to you?

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:51.819
Rapunzel?

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.121
What?

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:56.450
I can see you.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.765
Your hair!

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.091
I like it.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.411
Come on.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.127
We don't have much time.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.489
- Come on!
- I found you!

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.700
- You got the cow!
- And you've got the slipper!

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.128
- We've got all four!
- Yes, we've got all four!

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.161
I see a cow.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.900
- I see a slipper.
- Yes.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.220
And the cape as red as blood.

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.488
- And the hair as yellow as corn.
- We've got all four!

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.321
Wait a minute.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.860
That cow doesn't look
as white as milk to me.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.162
- Of course she is.
- Of course it is. Come on.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.530
She has to be.

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.900
This cow has been covered with flour!

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.340
You didn't get a real white cow?

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.260
We had a cow as white as milk.
Honestly, we did!

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.820
- Then where is she?
- She's dead!

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.900
And we thought
that you would prefer a live cow.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.540
Of course I would prefer a live cow!

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.571
So, show me the dead cow,
I'll bring her back to life.

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.420
Let's go!

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.529
Yeah, okay! It's this way, this way!

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.801
Jack!

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.561
Jack!

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.721
Jack!

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.060
There you are!
I've been worried sick about you!

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.260
There's a dead giant in our backyard!

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.380
There is?

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.920
You know there is!

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.420
You could have been crushed!

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.721
But, Mother, look!

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:34.085
The most beautiful harp!

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.924
You've stolen too much!

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.100
You could have been killed
climbing down that plant!

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.243
Come on, quick!
We buried her under some leaves!

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.060
Here, here, it's here!

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.100
What's happening?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:47.420
She's going to bring
Milky-White back to life.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.460
She can do that?

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:50.091
She's a witch, she can do anything.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.924
Stand back.

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:07.420
Milky-White, you're back!
I can't believe it!

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.740
It's almost midnight!

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.820
Quiet!

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.260
Feed the objects to the cow.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:13.607
What?

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.340
You heard me! Feed them to the cow!

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.881
- Really?
- Just try it.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.260
Fill that with milk.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.980
I'll do it. She'll only milk for me.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.566
Good boy.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.324
Squeeze, pal. You can do it.

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.300
It's not working!

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.601
What?

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.401
Wrong ingredients.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.780
Forget about your child.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.860
No, no, no!

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.685
We followed your instructions.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.740
One, the cow is as white as milk.

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.820
- Correct?
- Yes.

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.860
Two, the cape was certainly
as red as blood.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.380
- Yes.
- Three, there was the slipper.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.620
And four, I compared
the hair to this ear of corn!

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.780
I pulled this from a maiden in a tower.

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.081
You what?

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.780
What were you doing there?

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:23.445
Nothing, I was passing by.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:26.060
I touched that hair!

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.500
I told you I can't have touched
any of the ingredients!

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.980
How are we supposed...

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.780
- The corn! The corn!
- What?

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.287
You can use the silky hair off the corn!

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:38.362
- Yes. Pull it from the ear.
- Yes!

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.042
Feed it to the cow. Quickly!

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.740
It's working!

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:50.371
She's milking!

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:53.485
At last!

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.084
That was quick!

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:56.980
And it came to pass

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.282
all that seemed wrong was now right.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:03.300
The Witch succeeded
in reversing her mother's curse.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.047
Cinderella finally stopped
running from her Prince.

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:11.340
Jack was reunited with his beloved cow,

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.780
and his mother could now dress in the
best a golden egg could buy.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.620
And the Baker and his wife
were proud parents

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.969
of a strapping baby boy.

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.089
Thanks for the slipper!

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.605
Attention!

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:57.220
Let us cheer the newlyweds
as they embark...

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.460
And so,
with the kingdom filled with joy,

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.860
those who deserved to

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.369
were destined to live happily ever...

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.201
Jack!

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.500
Rapunzel!

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.500
- Attention! Attention!
- Rapunzel!

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.300
Let there be no panic!

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.500
No panic!

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.801
Jack!

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.281
Jack!

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.980
The Royal Prince
wishes to address his loyal subjects.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.691
Attention!

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.660
There is no need for worry.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.660
It was just an earthquake

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.725
in a far quadrant of our kingdom.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.407
Nothing to fear at all.

01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.566
I will personally
investigate the disturbance.

01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.860
Now everyone, back to your villages

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.367
and on with your lives.

01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.842
But as they made
their way back into the woods,

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.724
their familiar paths
were nowhere to be found.

01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:05.620
And their lives were about
to take an unexpected turn.

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:07.763
Here, here, watch out.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.369
I'm sure this is the way home.

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.322
Everything's so different.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.201
Oh, look.

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.365
Hello, little one.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.620
Hello, Mr. Baker.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.220
Are you all right?

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.761
What are you doing here,
with a suitcase?

01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:29.620
I'm moving in with my granny.

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.140
Our whole village collapsed,
and I couldn't find my mother anywhere,

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.140
and now I can't find
my granny's cottage.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.420
What do you mean?

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.460
Well, I went down the dell,
but I didn't recognize anything.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:40.205
There was no path!

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.740
Where is she? Where's Granny?

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.260
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Calm down, calm down.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:45.980
We can help you find
Granny's without the path.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.940
Will you just hold
him for a few moments?

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.740
- Really?
- Yes.

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.820
You'll come with us.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.100
Why does he always cry when I hold him?

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.580
Well, you needn't hold him
as though he was so fragile.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.900
He doesn't want me.
He wants his mother.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.660
I can't take care of him all the time.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:02.620
I will take care of him when he's older.

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:04.500
Mind your head. Watch your heads.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.847
Who might that be?

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.641
It's the Steward and the royal family.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.121
Hello there.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.020
What brings you into the woods?

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.260
The royal quarters have been destroyed.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.420
No!

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.140
The kingdom is under attack.

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.965
What is the royal family going to do?

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.420
How should I know?
I don't make policy, I just carry it out.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.460
I think it best we just go back to
the village. We'll take the girl with us.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.660
Come with us, you're going to be fine.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.041
You are going to come with us,
all right?

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.441
Oh, my God.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.844
It's a giant!

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.540
It's a giant woman!

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:55.846
Where is the lad who killed my husband?

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.767
- There is no lad here!
- We haven't seen him!

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.900
We will get him for you right away!

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.043
Don't move!

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.860
It was you who destroyed
our house, not an earthquake!

01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:10.060
And who destroyed my house?

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.169
I want him!

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.740
Here, would you
like a blind girl instead?

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.042
How dare you? She wants the boy!

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.820
Jack!

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.180
Has anybody seen my Jack?
He ran off again.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.220
Have you seen Jack? What?

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.820
She is looking for him, too.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.487
Give him to me!

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.260
Jack is just a lad!

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.420
We had no food to eat,

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:40.180
so he sold his cow
in exchange for some magic beans.

01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.528
The boy! I want the boy!

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.802
You leave my boy alone!

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:47.525
I'm waiting!

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:50.420
Be quiet, woman,
or you'll get us all killed!

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:51.780
You must be quiet!

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.380
Flouncing through our kingdom
in your great big clodhoppers...

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:56.540
Let us not anger the giant!

01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.620
...destroying everything in your path!

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:01.060
- Let's not anger the giant.
- You're just a big bully!

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.460
I'm gonna get my boy
and hide him so you'll never find him!

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.411
- You'll never, never, ever...
- Get back, woman!

01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.580
The boy is hiding in the steeple tower!

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.300
- You can find him there!
- Yes!

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.460
- That's true!
- Yes!

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.060
Yes, we saw him there!

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:18.620
And if he is not, I will return tonight

01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.287
and find you.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.125
All of you!

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.085
- Are you okay?
- Look.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.727
- What have you done to her?
- What?

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.140
I didn't mean to hurt her.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.408
I was just thinking of the greater good.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.660
If we're going to get through this

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:52.740
we're going to do it
if we all stick together.

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.460
Some people are cut out
to battle giants.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.260
Others are not.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:59.340
I don't have the constitution.

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:03.020
And as long as I
can be of no help, I'm going to hide.

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.321
Let's go.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.607
Everything will work out fine
in the end.

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.540
Not always.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.700
Come along.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.700
I don't know
where they think they're going.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:15.700
The giant's already destroyed
the entire village.

01:21:15.800 --> 01:21:18.620
Only thing left of my garden
are these beans.

01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:20.540
What are we going to do now?

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.841
We have no choice.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:24.447
Find the boy
and give her what she wants.

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.330
But if we do, she'll kill Jack!

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.286
And if we don't,
she'll kill half the kingdom!

01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.660
We mustn't let her get Jack!

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.460
We're not going to. It's okay.

01:21:35.560 --> 01:21:37.020
- You promise?
- I promise.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.685
Just rest.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.445
Rapunzel?

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.365
Rapunzel!

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.205
You're safe!

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.180
Thank goodness!

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:01.164
Who are you?

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.722
Surely you remember.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.220
Of course,

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.807
- you don't recognize me.
- Mother?

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.602
This is who I truly am, my dear.

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:14.201
Now you don't have to
be embarrassed by me.

01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:16.900
But you must come with me.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.407
- There is a giant in the land.
- My darling!

01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.041
Are you all right?

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.020
- Why did you run off?
- I was afraid.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.260
- Come with me.
- No, no, no!

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.500
She is not going with you.
You will come with me.

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.882
I will not come with you.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.580
Well, then, you leave me no choice.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:32.881
No!

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.887
No!

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:42.400
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:44.524
You are the one who blinded me.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.620
And locked me in a tower.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:47.860
To protect you!

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.686
And banished me to an island
in the middle of a swamp!

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:53.891
I was just trying to be a good mother.

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:56.685
Rapunzel, no!

01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.620
You will never be safe with him!

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.220
- Take me away from here.
- No!

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.540
Don't you understand?

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:05.060
I never want to see you again! Ever!

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:07.408
But, Rapunzel, the giant!

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.765
No matter what you say

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.521
Children won't listen

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.460
No matter what you know

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.060
Children refuse

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:37.125
To learn

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:41.180
Guide them along the way

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.926
Still they don't listen

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.860
Children can only grow

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:51.460
From something you love

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:56.641
To something you lose

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.801
Jack!

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.620
- Jack!
- Jack!

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.700
Jack!

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.100
Jack, where are you?

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.447
Jack!

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.300
We're never going to find him.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:10.540
I think we should fan out.
It will increase our chances.

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.500
- I'm not leaving you on your own.
- I'll be all right.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:13.820
What if we get lost?

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.940
We count our steps from right here.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:17.100
I'll go, too!

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.460
No. You know what?

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.446
You are going to stay
right here with the baby.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.604
And we'll be right back.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.660
You would leave our child with her?

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.340
He's asleep.
He will be safe with the girl.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.260
I'm very capable
of taking care of the baby.

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.340
See?

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.980
- What if the giant comes back?
- What if, what if!

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:38.486
500 paces. Go.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:42.651
- One, two, three...
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.121
Here.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.047
Let me give you this.

01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.740
I don't want you to get cold.

01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.121
Okay.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.060
One, two, three, four, five...

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.500
- Jack!
- Six, seven, eight,

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:59.260
nine, ten...

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.005
Jack!

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.260
167, 168, 169, 170, 171,

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:11.564
172, 173, 174...

01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.043
Hello, Your Royal Highness.

01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.527
Well, hello.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.580
Hello, again.

01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:23.201
We've met before, actually.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:24.940
Yes, of course.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.571
Yes.

01:25:27.440 --> 01:25:30.405
You must be here to slay the giant.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.860
- The giant?
- Yes.

01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:36.607
Haven't you heard?
We have a giant in our midst.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.170
Not an earthquake.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.601
Of course.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.446
The giant.

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.683
It's a lady giant.

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:48.929
Which is very unusual.

01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.289
I should think so.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.580
And why are you alone in the woods?

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:58.123
Well, I came here with my husband.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.140
And we were...

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:03.568
Well, you see, it's a long story.

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:07.300
And he would let you roam
alone in the woods?

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:10.444
Well, no, actually. It was my choice.

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.220
How brave.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.340
Brave?

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:16.641
Yes.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.887
Anything can happen in the woods

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.130
May I kiss you?

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.770
Any moment we could be crushed

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:30.444
Don't feel rushed

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.660
This is ridiculous
What am I doing here?

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:38.566
I'm in the wrong story

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.420
Wait, wait, wait, we can't do this!
You have a princess!

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.451
- Well, yes, I do.
- And I have a baker.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.121
Of course.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.607
You're right. How foolish.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:59.241
Foolishness can happen in the woods

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:01.700
Once again, please

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.641
Let your hesitations be hushed

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:11.220
Any moment, big or small
Is a moment, after all

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:16.003
Seize the moment, skies may fall
Any moment

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.842
But this is not right!

01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:27.683
Right and wrong don't
matter in the woods

01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.580
Only feelings

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:33.601
Let us meet the moment unblushed

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.740
Life is often so unpleasant

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:39.060
You must know that, as a peasant

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.980
Best to take the moment present

01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:45.365
As a present for the moment

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:50.641
476, 477,

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:54.940
478, 479, 480.

01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.891
481, 482, 483...

01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.420
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:02.660
You haven't seen
a boy anywhere, have you?

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.724
He's about so high.

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.241
I'm sorry, may I be of some service?

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.490
The tree has fallen.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.049
Mother's grave, destroyed.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:15.366
I'm sorry.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:17.540
I shouldn't complain.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:20.207
I'm sure others have
suffered worse after the earthquake.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.081
No, no, this isn't an earthquake.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.206
There's a giant terrorizing the kingdom.

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:31.300
Then I'm sure the Prince will see to it
that the giant is rid from our land.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.682
The Prince?

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.446
No doubt he's off somewhere
seducing some young maiden.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:37.900
What?

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.851
You look like the Princess, but dirty.

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.460
Oh, my! You are the...

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.380
I didn't recognize you, honestly.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.923
No, no. Please, get up.
I'm not a princess here.

01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:50.460
I had to disguise myself.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:53.445
I'm not permitted to leave
the palace unescorted.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:01.282
If you'd like, you could come with me.

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:05.244
I mean, you'll be safe in our company.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:06.961
Thank you.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.500
It's this way. My wife is somewhere.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:15.326
We decided to walk 500 paces
in one direction...

01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.449
I must leave you.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.291
Now I must go off to slay a giant.

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.283
I shall not forget you.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:36.260
How brave you are
to be alone in the woods.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:39.006
And how alive you've made me feel.

01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:48.162
What was that?

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:54.700
Was that me? Was that him?

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.641
Did a prince really kiss me?

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:03.483
And kiss me? And kiss me?

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.522
And did I kiss him back?

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.740
Was it wrong? Am I mad?

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:13.380
Is that all? Does he miss me?

01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:17.048
Was he suddenly
Getting bored with me?

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.725
Wake up, stop dreaming
Stop prancing about the woods

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:25.860
It's not beseeming
What is it about the woods?

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.500
Back to life, back to sense
Back to child, back to husband

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.007
No one lives in the woods

01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.380
There are vows, there are ties

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.220
There are needs, there are standards

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.682
There are shouldn'ts and shoulds

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:42.100
Why not both instead?

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.563
There's the answer, if you're clever

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:50.420
Have a child for warmth
And a baker for bread

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:54.327
And a prince for whatever

01:30:54.680 --> 01:30:55.740
Never

01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.644
It's these woods

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:02.860
Face the facts, find the boy
Join the group, stop the giant

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.208
Just get out of these woods

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.460
Was that him? Yes, it was
Was that me? No, it wasn't

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.047
Just a trick of the woods

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.082
Just a moment

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:19.047
One peculiar, passing moment

01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:21.740
Must it all be either less or more?

01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:23.780
Either plain or grand?

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.210
Is it always "Or"? Is it never "And"?

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.820
That's what woods are for

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.380
For those moments in the woods

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:39.140
Oh, if life were made of moments

01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:42.660
Even now and then a bad one

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:46.260
But if life were only moments

01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:49.962
Then you'd never know you had one

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:54.300
First a witch, then a child
Then a prince, then a moment

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:56.967
Who can live in the woods?

01:31:57.360 --> 01:32:00.820
And to get what you wish
Only just for a moment

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.646
These are dangerous woods

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:07.250
Let the moment go

01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:10.740
Don't forget it for a moment, though

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:13.820
Just remembering you've had an "And"

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.646
When you're back to "Or"

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:22.840
Makes the "Or" mean more
Than it did before

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:28.460
Now I understand

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.491
And it's time to leave the woods

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.681
Which way was it?

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:43.011
172, 173, 174, 175...

01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:51.287
172, 173, 174...

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.100
She should be back by now.

01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.180
She wouldn't get lost.

01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:47.050
I'm sure she'll return soon.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.620
I'm going to go and look for her.
Will you?

01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.843
- Look who I found.
- You're hurting me!

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:54.140
Let go of him!

01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.580
I'll let go of him
when I give him to the giant.

01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.260
Leave him alone!

01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.620
Keep away from him!

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.843
Stop! Stop! I said stop!

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.004
Where did you find this?

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.484
I'm sorry, sir.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.251
It's my wife's.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:15.650
I'm sorry. I came upon her.
She was at the bottom of a cliff.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:18.290
What are you saying?

01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:20.291
How awful.

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.001
No.

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:24.321
No!

01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.685
This is all my fault.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.321
I shouldn't have let
her wander off alone.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.611
I should have made her stay with me.

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:34.820
Remorse will get you nowhere.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.980
- My wife is dead!
- Wake up!

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:38.420
When you're dead, you're dead.

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.780
It's time we get this
boy to the giant before we're all dead.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:41.860
Keep away from him!

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.980
This is no time to be soft-hearted!

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.380
He's going to the giant
and I'm taking him!

01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.540
Yes! Yes, he's the one to blame!

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.420
It's because of you there's a giant
in our midst, and my wife is dead!

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:54.900
But it isn't my fault
I was given those beans

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.340
You persuaded me to trade away
My cow for beans

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.620
And without those beans
There'd have been no stalk

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.180
To get up to the giants
In the first place

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:02.220
Wait a minute

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:04.420
Magic beans
For a cow so old

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.620
That you had to tell a lie to sell it
Which you told

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:08.820
Were they worthless beans?
Were they oversold?

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.140
Oh, and tell us who persuaded you
To steal that gold

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.260
- See, it's your fault
- No!

01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.460
- Yes, it's your fault
- No!

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:14.620
- Yes, it is
- It's not!

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.860
- It's true
- Wait a minute though

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.540
I only stole the gold to get my cow back
From you

01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:19.780
- So it's your fault
- Yes!

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:20.900
No, it isn't

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.820
I'd have kept those beans
But our house was cursed

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.900
She made us get a cow
To get the curse reversed

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.220
It's his father's fault
That the curse got placed

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.420
And the place got cursed
In the first place

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.700
- Oh, then it's his fault
- So

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:31.820
- It was his fault
- No!

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:33.020
Yes, it is, it's his

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.300
- I guess
- Wait a minute though

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:36.540
I chopped down the beanstalk
Right, that's clear

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.700
But without any beanstalk
Then what's queer

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:41.060
Is how did the second giant
Get down here

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.220
In the first place
Second place?

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.260
- Yes.
- How?

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.540
Well, who had the other bean?

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.780
- The other bean?
- The other bean?

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.500
- You pocketed the other bean
- I didn't. Yes, I did

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:48.580
So it's your fault

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.980
No, it isn't
'Cause I gave it to my wife

01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.060
- So it's her fault
- No, it isn't

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:52.300
- Then whose is it?
- Wait a minute

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:54.580
She exchanged that bean
To obtain your shoe

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:56.740
So the one who knows what happened
To the bean is you

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.860
You mean that old bean
That your wife... Oh, dear

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.300
But I never knew and so I threw...
Well, don't look here

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:02.580
- So it's your fault
- But...

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:03.740
- See, it's her fault
- But...

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:05.020
And it isn't mine at all

01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.060
But what?

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.020
Well, if you hadn't gone
Back up again

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.100
We were needy

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:10.620
You were greedy
Did you need that hen?

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.940
But I got it for my mother

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:13.060
So it's her fault then

01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:14.420
Yes, and what about the harp
In the third place?

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.540
The harp, yes

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.140
- She went and dared me to
- I dared you to?

01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.780
- She said that I was scared
- Me?

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:19.900
- So she dared me
- No, I didn't

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:20.940
So it's your fault

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.460
- Wait a minute
- If you hadn't dared him to

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.780
And you had left the harp alone

01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:25.700
If you hadn't thrown away the bean
In the first place

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.420
If she hadn't raised them
in the first place

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.500
- You raised the beans in the first place
- It's your fault

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.740
You're responsible
You're the one to blame

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.041
It's your fault

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:49.046
It's the last midnight

01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:54.688
It's the last wish

01:36:55.520 --> 01:37:00.726
It's the last midnight

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:06.280
Soon it will be boom
Squish

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.820
Told a little lie

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.180
Stole a little gold

01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.642
Broke a little vow

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:15.540
Did you?

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:17.700
Had to get your prince

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.700
Had to get your cow

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:22.140
Had to get your wish
Doesn't matter how

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:24.340
Anyway, it doesn't matter now

01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.500
It's the last midnight

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.420
It's the boom
Splat

01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:36.500
Nothing but a vast midnight

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.088
Everybody smashed flat

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.325
Nothing we can do

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.820
Not exactly true

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:46.565
We could always give her the boy

01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:48.700
No, of course

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.860
What really matters is the blame
Someone you can blame

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:56.060
Fine, if that's the thing you enjoy
Placing the blame

01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.648
If that's the aim
Give me the blame

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.980
Just give me the boy

01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.406
- No!
- No!

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:06.001
No.

01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:11.300
You're so nice

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.500
You're not good
You're not bad

01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.380
You're just nice

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:17.580
I'm not good
I'm not nice

01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.660
I'm just right

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:21.500
I'm the Witch

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:26.700
You're the world

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.020
I'm the hitch
I'm what no one believes

01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.860
I'm the Witch

01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:35.721
You're all liars and thieves
Like his father

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.020
Like his son will be, too

01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:40.140
Oh, why bother?

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:43.740
You'll just do what you do

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:49.285
It's the last midnight
So goodbye, all

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.660
Coming at you fast
Midnight

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:58.180
Soon you'll see the sky fall

01:38:58.280 --> 01:38:59.925
Here, you want a bean?

01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.925
Have another bean

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.722
Beans were made for making you rich

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.369
Plant them and they soar
Here, you want some more?

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:11.460
Listen to the roar
Giants by the score

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.500
Oh well, you can blame another witch

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:16.963
It's the last midnight

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.740
It's the last verse

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.340
Now, before it's past midnight

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:27.860
I'm leaving you my last curse

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.900
I'm leaving you alone

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.660
You can tend the garden, it's yours
Separate and alone

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:37.660
Everybody down on all fours

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.740
All right, Mother, when?

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.567
Lost the beans again
Punish me the way you did then

01:39:45.720 --> 01:39:47.860
Give me claws and a hunch

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.100
Just away from this bunch
And the gloom

01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:56.611
And the doom
And the boom

01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:59.361
Crunch!

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:22.260
Maybe I shouldn't have
stolen from the giant.

01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.460
Maybe I shouldn't have
strayed from the path.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.762
Maybe I shouldn't have
attended the Ball.

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.170
Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have.

01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:32.060
- Where are you going?
- Away from here.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:34.380
But you said we had
to find our way out of this together.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.980
It doesn't matter if we're
together or we're apart.

01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.180
We need your help.

01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.780
You don't understand!

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.140
I depended on my wife for everything!

01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:44.180
She was the one who helped.

01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.766
You would leave your child?

01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:49.780
He'll be happier
in the arms of a princess.

01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:51.081
But wait!

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:14.340
What are you doing here?

01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.420
Son...

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.780
I don't want to talk to you.

01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:18.020
It's because of you
all of this happened!

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.460
- Go away!
- I'm sorry. I did a foolish thing.

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:22.820
Why would you do that?
Why did you take the Witch's beans?

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.980
They were there and I wanted them.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.500
I didn't think. I was being careless.

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:27.140
- Selfish.
- Yes.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.260
You stole and you got caught,
and you did what you do.

01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.580
You just ran away.

01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.803
When your mother died, I was...

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:40.740
I hated myself. I ran away
from my guilt and my shame.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.565
And your son.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:45.900
Yes, my son, and I'm sorry for that.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.460
- Then what do you want?
- Aren't you making the same mistake?

01:41:48.560 --> 01:41:50.125
Aren't you running away?

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.769
Be better than me,

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.481
son.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.209
Do better.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.860
See, so this is you,

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.540
and you're going to come over here.

01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:45.740
If there were just some way
we could surprise the giant.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.100
She's too tall to surprise.

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.940
So, that's why
I'm going to be behind here.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:51.083
Yeah, and then you can come here,

01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.740
climb on top...

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:54.246
I knew you wouldn't give up.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.500
He wouldn't leave his baby.

01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:58.245
It looked like he was going to.

01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.050
Give me my son.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.580
What are we gonna do now?

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:16.167
We need to rid this kingdom
of the giant together.

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.460
She'll be back soon, so here's the plan.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:21.300
We're going to feed Jack to the giant.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.740
- What?
- No!

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:24.460
- We're going to use you as bait!
- Bait?

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.331
To lure the giant to the tar pit.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.620
The birds can help!

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:32.685
Good friends, we need
your help now more than ever.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.530
What of the prince?

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:39.220
That doesn't matter now.

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.410
What's important is that
we find a way to defeat the giant.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.041
Yes!

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:46.607
Thank you, birds!

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.804
You can talk to birds?

01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.925
The birds will do their part.

01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.780
- Okay, we don't have much time.
- I'm excited!

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.380
- First, we'll need a weapon.
- I wish I had my sling!

01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.205
We can make some.

01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.448
Your father is being very brave.

01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:09.740
We're going to be very brave too.

01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:11.644
Are you all right, miss?

01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:15.761
The giant went in that direction.

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.085
My darling!

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:20.491
Oh, my darling!

01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:24.084
I did not recognize you.
What are you doing here?

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.165
And with a child?

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.660
You must get back to the castle at once.
There is a giant on the loose.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.371
I'm well aware of that.

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.525
My love, what is it?

01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:38.847
Maybe I'm not your only love.

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.900
I love you! Truly, I do.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.851
If you love me, why did you stray?

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.608
I thought that if you were mine,

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:52.722
I would never wish for more.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.620
If this is how you behave as a prince,

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.763
what kind of king will you be?

01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:03.448
I was raised to be charming,
not sincere.

01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:06.329
I think you should go.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.165
Is that what you really wish?

01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:13.580
My father's house was a nightmare.

01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:15.405
Your house a dream.

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:19.368
Now I want something in-between.

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:37.762
I shall always love
the maiden who ran away.

01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:41.681
And I the faraway prince.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.780
Careful. Not so fast.

01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:59.731
Don't worry.
This is easier than the beanstalk.

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.540
They're up in the tree! Over there!

01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:04.968
We made slings out of my cape!

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:10.002
I wanted to climb the tree too.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.051
I'm glad you're here to help me.

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.561
What's wrong?

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.170
I think my granny
and my mother would be upset with me.

01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:27.721
Why?

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.282
They said to always make them proud.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.246
And here I am, about to kill somebody.

01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.210
Not somebody.

01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:39.500
A giant who's done a lot of harm.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.450
But a giant is a person.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.362
Aren't we to show forgiveness?

01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:51.843
Mother cannot guide you

01:46:52.480 --> 01:46:55.763
Now you're on your own

01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:59.660
Only me beside you

01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:03.248
Still you're not alone

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:08.540
No one is alone, truly

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.764
No one is alone

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.326
I wish...

01:47:14.280 --> 01:47:15.481
I know.

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.220
Wait until my mother
hears I've slain the giant.

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.681
Jack,

01:47:20.920 --> 01:47:22.620
there's something you need to know.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.380
It's about your mother.

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:25.681
What?

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.445
She didn't make it.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.700
- Was she killed by the giant?
- No.

01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:38.740
It wasn't like that.

01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:42.209
She was fighting with the giant,
she was trying to protect you,

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.248
and she was pushed by the Steward.

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:47.220
And she fell.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.460
- The Steward will pay for this.
- No, Jack!

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.100
After we slay the giant,
I will slay him!

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.890
You'll do nothing of the kind.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:56.530
What he did was wrong.
He should be punished.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.002
It's not as easy as that.

01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.980
Mother isn't here now

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:06.100
Wrong things, right things

01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:08.140
Who knows what she'd say?

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:10.060
Who can say what's true?

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:11.940
Nothing's quite so clear now

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.140
Do things, fight things

01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.140
Feel you've lost your way?

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.260
You decide

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.140
But you are not alone

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.660
Believe me
No one is alone

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.300
No one is alone

01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.460
Believe me

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:26.780
Truly

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:29.100
People make mistakes

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.260
Fathers

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.340
Mothers

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:33.722
People make mistakes

01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.806
Holding to their own

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.283
Thinking they're alone

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:43.020
Honor their mistakes

01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:44.180
Fight for their mistakes

01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:45.740
Everybody makes

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:49.522
One another's
Terrible mistakes

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.820
Witches can be right

01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:53.940
Giants can be good

01:48:54.040 --> 01:48:56.083
You decide what's right

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.460
You decide what's good

01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.330
Just remember

01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.768
Just remember

01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:05.700
Someone is on your side

01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:06.820
Our side

01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:09.805
Our side
Someone else is not

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:13.860
While we're seeing our side

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.730
- Our side
- Our side

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:18.566
Maybe we forgot

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.249
They are not alone

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.921
No one is alone

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:33.443
Someone is on your side

01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:38.003
No one is alo...

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.620
Go, Jack.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.285
- Be careful.
- Yeah.

01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:49.005
Here she comes.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.180
Where is the boy?

01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.460
We have him!

01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.580
Where?

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.609
He's hiding in that tree!

01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:21.771
Here I am!

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:42.121
You ready?

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.245
Ready!

01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.980
Good birds!

01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.964
She does not look happy.

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.882
- Look out, Jack!
- Jack!

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:21.246
Jack!

01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:10.127
Jack?

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.767
- Where are they?
- Jack!

01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.161
Jack!

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:16.285
Mr. Baker!

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:18.780
- Jack!
- Over here!

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:20.445
Jack!

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.860
Take him!

01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:23.161
Be careful!

01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:25.460
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:26.966
Careful, careful!

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:29.060
Where is he?

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.260
- He's not with you?
- Jack!

01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:31.380
Mr. Baker!

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:32.841
Jack!

01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.121
Help me!

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.965
Jack, I'm here!

01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.482
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:50.740
- Okay?
- Yeah!

01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:52.820
You okay? You all right?

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.202
- Yeah.
- All right? Yeah?

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:57.405
We did it.

01:52:57.840 --> 01:52:59.405
We did it!

01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.420
And now we can return home.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:13.041
What home?
I have no one to take care of me.

01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:15.220
And we have nowhere to go.

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.340
So we'll move in with you.

01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:19.005
Well, it's...

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:22.460
Of course.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.100
Of course you can come and stay with me.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.620
And you can come too!

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.780
- Only if you want to.
- I'll gladly help you with your house.

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:31.447
There are times
I actually enjoy cleaning.

01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:34.571
Here.

01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.087
What's this?

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.690
Come on, now.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:49.761
I know.

01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:54.247
I know, you miss your mother.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.570
I miss her too.

01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:00.441
Please.

01:54:01.760 --> 01:54:03.980
Maybe I just wasn't
meant to have children.

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.060
Don't say that.

01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.500
Of course you were
meant to have children.

01:54:06.600 --> 01:54:10.740
But how can I go about being a father
when I had no father to show me?

01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:13.140
Just calm the child

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:15.740
Yes, calm the child

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:18.620
Look, tell him the story
Of how it all happened

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:21.969
Be father and mother
You'll know what to do

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:24.761
Alone.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:30.167
Sometimes people leave you

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:34.802
Halfway through the wood

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:39.660
Do not let it grieve you

01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:43.020
No one leaves for good

01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.180
You are not alone

01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.644
No one is alone

01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:57.491
Hold him to the light now

01:54:57.920 --> 01:55:01.647
Let him see the glow

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:06.209
Things will be all right now

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:10.287
Tell him what you know

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.900
Once upon a time, in a far off kingdom,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.180
there lay a small village
at the edge of the woods.

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.500
Careful the things you say

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.220
- And in this village...
- Children will listen

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:29.140
...there lived a young maiden...

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:31.580
- Careful the things you do
- ...a carefree young lad...

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:33.540
Children will see

01:55:33.640 --> 01:55:35.500
...and a childless baker...

01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:38.580
And learn

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:40.644
...with his wife.

01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.444
Guide them along the way

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.045
Children will glisten

01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:52.860
Children will look to you

01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:56.260
For which way to turn

01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:00.540
To learn what to be

01:56:00.640 --> 01:56:06.620
Careful before you say "Listen to me"

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.766
Children will listen

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:14.780
Careful the wish you make

01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:18.380
Wishes are children

01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:21.260
Careful the path they take

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.940
Wishes come true

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:30.929
Not free

01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:35.420
Careful the spell you cast

01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.980
Not just on children

01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:42.180
Sometimes the spell may last

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.740
Past what you can see

01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:49.940
And turn against you

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:52.740
Careful the tale you tell

01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:56.362
That is the spell

01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.970
Children will listen

01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:03.445
I wish...
