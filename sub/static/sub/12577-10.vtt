00:31.167 --> 00:34.467
You guys are in big,
big trouble.

00:34.533 --> 00:36.900
This is the worst
offense I've seen

00:36.967 --> 00:39.700
in my 14 years as chief fire
investigator.

00:39.767 --> 00:40.900
Dauterive comma

william fontaine
de la tour comma

00:43.200 --> 00:45.900
sergeant barber comma,
united states...

00:45.967 --> 00:48.400
Comma numbskull,
comma shut up.

00:48.467 --> 00:49.600
Well, got to go.

00:49.667 --> 00:51.067
Sit down.

00:51.133 --> 00:52.400
Nobody's going anywhere

00:52.467 --> 00:54.467
until I find out
how this happened.

00:54.533 --> 00:56.933
Now, according
to heck dorland's statement

00:57.000 --> 00:59.567
you were standing out
behind your houses

00:59.633 --> 01:01.600
doing some light yard work...

01:06.600 --> 01:08.700
Bill called;
he's going to be late.

01:08.767 --> 01:12.200
New batch of recruits started
at the base this morning.

01:12.267 --> 01:13.833
He's busy bagging hair.

01:15.667 --> 01:17.533
There's old heck dorland

01:17.600 --> 01:20.367
taking the fire truck
out for a spin.

01:20.433 --> 01:21.533
Lucky bunny.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.367
I'm a fireman!

01:29.433 --> 01:30.833
I'm a fi...

01:30.900 --> 01:32.367
( sighing )

01:32.433 --> 01:34.367
( grunts )

01:34.433 --> 01:35.867
professional firefighters

01:35.933 --> 01:37.533
got the "red flu"
this morning

01:37.600 --> 01:39.200
leaving just us volunteers.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.067
They're holding out for a raise.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.800
They're striking?

01:42.867 --> 01:46.067
Well, sir, fires don't go on strike,
I tell you what.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.700
Heck came by the base
looking for volunteers.

01:48.767 --> 01:51.367
I was the only one
the base commander let go.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.200
What about the rest
of you guys?

01:53.267 --> 01:54.500
You interested?

01:54.567 --> 01:55.867
You talking about firemen, man?

01:55.933 --> 01:57.833
Talking 'bout
"rampart 51, rampart 51."

01:57.900 --> 01:59.133
"dang old emergency, man."

01:59.200 --> 02:00.767
I got them shows on tape, man.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.067
I'd love to help.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.867
Fact. Volunteer firemen
receive sirens

02:03.933 --> 02:05.567
for their personal vehicles.

02:05.633 --> 02:08.233
Fact. And we can use them
whenever we want.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.600
Fact!

02:09.667 --> 02:12.067
Dale, sirens are only
for fire emergencies.

02:12.067 --> 02:15.433
Now, heck, assuming I pass the required
courses and notify

02:15.500 --> 02:17.100
my insurance
company in writing

02:17.167 --> 02:19.400
will I get to drive
the fire truck?

02:19.467 --> 02:20.900
You got any speeding tickets?

02:20.967 --> 02:21.933
No, sir.

02:22.067 --> 02:23.167
I do! I do!

02:23.233 --> 02:25.067
( grunting and panting )

02:25.133 --> 02:26.933
oh, careful.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.400
Ooh, spoons.

02:30.467 --> 02:34.067
Can I assume the potatoes
will be mashed tonight?

02:34.133 --> 02:37.233
Well, bobby,
your dad is a real fireman.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.333
What do you think about that?

02:39.400 --> 02:40.900
I'm a little surprised--

02:40.967 --> 02:43.400
You know, you always seem
to make such a big deal

02:43.467 --> 02:45.300
about being a propane salesman.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.900
I've got nights
and weekends free.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.767
I could be
a fireman, too!

02:49.833 --> 02:51.667
She's right, hank.
deputize her.

02:51.733 --> 02:53.567
No. Luanne
can't be a fireman.

02:53.633 --> 02:57.333
What if a very large man was
trapped in a burning building

02:57.400 --> 02:59.233
and she had to carry him out?

02:59.300 --> 03:02.067
Then, she would do
"a fireperson's carry"

03:02.133 --> 03:04.533
formerly known
as "a fireman's carry."

03:04.600 --> 03:05.933
What's that?

03:06.067 --> 03:08.400
It allows a woman
to lift a man's weight

03:08.467 --> 03:12.533
through a scientific principle
that I like to call "leverage."

03:12.600 --> 03:14.400
Now, come over here.
i'll show you.

03:14.467 --> 03:15.500
( sighing )

03:15.567 --> 03:18.067
( grunting )

03:18.133 --> 03:20.533
hoh-yeah!

03:20.600 --> 03:22.067
( sotto ):
oh, no.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.400
Peggy, are you okay?

03:24.467 --> 03:26.067
Well, yes,
of course I am.

03:26.133 --> 03:29.133
( voice trembling ):
okay, let's eat.

03:36.933 --> 03:38.633
I'll start
the water flow.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.733
Gribble, you're
nozzle man

03:40.800 --> 03:43.300
so aim at the base
of the flame.

03:46.267 --> 03:48.200
Come on, dale,
straighten it out!

03:48.267 --> 03:49.800
Watch where
you're aiming!

03:51.467 --> 03:53.800
( yelling )

04:02.600 --> 04:04.367
it wasn't my fault.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.067
My mask fogged up.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.700
Damn it, dale,
the safety

04:07.767 --> 04:09.900
and welfare of
arlen is at stake.

04:09.967 --> 04:10.933
Get serious.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.567
Good idea, beef.

04:14.633 --> 04:17.800
All right, it's time
you boys met the jaws.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.899
Oh, ho.
oh, man.

04:19.966 --> 04:23.367
Jaws of life,
a.k.a. The jaws.

04:23.433 --> 04:25.067
Victim's trapped
in a car

04:25.100 --> 04:27.433
this baby will
peel it like
an orange.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.900
Yeah, let's see what it does
with a real orange.

04:32.967 --> 04:34.867
Heck, I thought
i'd go ahead

04:34.933 --> 04:36.400
and sharpen all the axes.

04:36.467 --> 04:39.533
♪ hank's a lumberjack
and he's okay. ♪

04:39.600 --> 04:41.633
( laughing )

04:43.833 --> 04:46.067
relax, hank.
we're off the clock.

04:46.133 --> 04:48.267
Hey, say hello to chet elderson

04:48.333 --> 04:51.067
one of arlen's first
volunteer firemen.

04:51.133 --> 04:52.733
Well, what
an honor, sir.

04:52.800 --> 04:53.900
Hank hill--

04:53.967 --> 04:55.933
Propane and propane
accessories...

04:56.067 --> 04:59.167
Aah, ain't you the idiot
what blew up the mega lo mart?

04:59.233 --> 05:01.900
I was supposed to take
my vacation that week.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.400
Idiot.

05:03.467 --> 05:06.067
Uh, actually, sir,
the idiot you're thinking of

05:06.133 --> 05:07.433
was named buckley.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.567
Yeah, yeah.
i'm retired now.

05:10.633 --> 05:12.067
Who unplugged my sign?

05:12.133 --> 05:13.500
Chet, you know
you can't

05:13.567 --> 05:15.067
plug it in.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.400
It don't work right.

05:16.467 --> 05:18.100
I'll get it
for you.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.667
( sputtering and yelling )

05:22.733 --> 05:24.500
( laughing )

05:26.267 --> 05:28.200
( beeping )

05:34.133 --> 05:35.567
how'd I do, bobby?

05:35.633 --> 05:37.667
Okay... Go!

05:37.733 --> 05:39.600
( sighing ):
oh... God.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.900
That's good, boys,
keep playing firemen.

05:47.967 --> 05:49.233
Peggy, let me
help you.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.667
Oh, I'm fine.
I've got it.

05:50.733 --> 05:51.967
Did you hurt your leg?

05:52.067 --> 05:53.867
'cause, uh,
you seem to be limping.

05:53.933 --> 05:55.533
I have not noticed a limp.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.833
Maybe it's because
i'm carrying a heavy bag.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.433
Maybe it has
something to do

05:59.500 --> 06:01.833
with when you
pulled your groin
picking me up.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.633
Well, honey, I don't think
that could be true

06:04.700 --> 06:06.700
since ladies do not have groins.

06:10.400 --> 06:13.267
All right, let's talk
about oxygen tanks.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.633
The cylinder gauge
should be within

06:15.700 --> 06:18.533
how many p.s.i. Of
the regulator gauge?

06:18.600 --> 06:20.067
Anyone?

06:20.100 --> 06:21.733
I am protesting
the results

06:21.800 --> 06:24.133
of last night's
ping-pong tournament.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.367
Boomhauer cannot play the ball
off of bill's head.

06:27.433 --> 06:32.433
No, we all agreed,
my head's in play.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.567
Hank ( over loudspeaker ):
in the first round

06:34.633 --> 06:37.600
the dallas cowboys
select bobby hill

06:37.667 --> 06:39.067
left tackle.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.100
Bobby:
hey, dad.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.533
I told you my dad
was a fireman.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.533
He's a volunteer.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.967
Ooh, dad, we're muddy.

06:48.067 --> 06:50.100
Could you hose us off?

06:50.167 --> 06:52.367
Sure. I'll open up
the hydrant.

06:52.433 --> 06:55.667
Dale, the hydrants
are for fire emergencies.

06:55.733 --> 06:59.200
They don't know
how to open the hydrant.

06:59.267 --> 07:01.900
Because they're
volunteers.

07:01.967 --> 07:04.900
Son, you're about to get very,
very wet.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.400
Fireman gribble, drill time.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.067
Get me the
hydrant wrench.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.733
Mr. Boomhauer,
I need you to run
a three-inch hose.

07:10.800 --> 07:11.967
Bill, hook it up.

07:16.467 --> 07:18.067
( grunting )

07:18.133 --> 07:19.700
it's stuck.

07:19.767 --> 07:22.067
That's because you're turning it
the wrong way.

07:22.067 --> 07:23.067
Give me the wrench.

07:23.133 --> 07:25.067
No, no,
wait. Wait...

07:25.133 --> 07:26.667
( yelling )

07:26.733 --> 07:27.900
shut it off!

07:27.967 --> 07:29.067
Shut it off!

07:29.067 --> 07:31.733
Uh... Uh...

07:31.800 --> 07:33.067
hey!

07:33.133 --> 07:35.233
Damn it, dale,
you stripped the bolt!

07:35.300 --> 07:35.967
It wasn't me.

07:38.067 --> 07:39.800
Dang old
out the way, man.

07:39.867 --> 07:41.233
Quit it, knucklehead.

07:41.300 --> 07:42.967
The jaws ain't for that.

07:49.133 --> 07:52.067
So you were the ones
who busted that hydrant.

07:52.133 --> 07:55.333
We got an anonymous call
it was a bunch of kids.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.433
Bunch of kids?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.900
I gave you names--

07:57.967 --> 08:00.167
Hill, bobby.
gribble, joseph...

08:00.233 --> 08:01.400
It was dale's fault.

08:01.467 --> 08:02.633
Took my jaws of life.

08:02.700 --> 08:03.567
ow!
ow!

08:03.633 --> 08:05.067
Oh, god.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.067
The hydrant's the least
of our problems.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.533
He doesn't care about that.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.067
He's right, I don't.

08:10.133 --> 08:12.667
You half-wits could be
looking at jail time.

08:12.733 --> 08:17.067
Uh... Uh, my name is
shackleford, rusty shackleford.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.867
I refuse to speak
without my attorney present.

08:20.933 --> 08:24.533
I am Mr. Shackleford's attorney,
rusty shackleford.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.067
My client pleads insanity.

08:27.133 --> 08:29.400
My name is dauterive
comma bill

08:29.467 --> 08:31.867
and I am also insane.

08:31.933 --> 08:33.667
( groaning )

08:38.067 --> 08:39.067
gribble...

08:39.133 --> 08:40.767
You've had your phone call.

08:40.832 --> 08:43.100
I know, but now i'm making one
as shackleford.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.067
You see what
I have to deal with?

08:45.133 --> 08:46.467
( sighs )

08:46.533 --> 08:49.400
let's just get back
to the matter at hand.

08:49.467 --> 08:52.067
After you broke
the fire hydrant...

08:52.133 --> 08:54.133
Please, guys,
we've been given

08:54.200 --> 08:56.767
a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity here.

08:56.833 --> 09:00.233
Now, let's not do anything more
to screw this up.

09:00.300 --> 09:02.967
Now, how about running
some ladder-carry drills?

09:03.067 --> 09:04.367
Not interested.

09:04.433 --> 09:07.133
You pushed me aside,
made me look like a fool

09:07.200 --> 09:09.500
in front of my own
flesh and blood.

09:09.567 --> 09:11.400
( snores )

09:11.467 --> 09:14.233
hey, shades, plug in
my alamo sign, will ya?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.467
Better not, dale.

09:15.533 --> 09:16.700

09:52.333 --> 09:53.333

Oh, aunt peggy, it looks like

10:15.100 --> 10:17.600
your groins are
still hurting you.

10:17.667 --> 10:19.667
I just need to spend a night
icing it.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.600
Thank god hank's sleeping
at the fire station tonight.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.567
Why don't you
just admit to him

10:24.633 --> 10:27.167
that you hurt yourself
picking up bobby?

10:27.233 --> 10:30.100
Oh, honey, you've
never been married.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.367
( sighs )
now who left the...

10:38.433 --> 10:39.867
What?

10:39.933 --> 10:41.500
( grunting )

10:41.567 --> 10:43.033
hank:
what the h...

10:43.100 --> 10:45.567
You can't use the fire hose
like this.

10:45.633 --> 10:47.533
You'll damage the elasticity.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.033
Whatcha got under the foil,
mr. Party pooper?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.233
Some party poop?

10:52.300 --> 10:54.567
Uh, peggy made
some frito pie for us.

10:54.633 --> 10:56.400
Hey, yo.

10:56.467 --> 10:58.933
Hey, dale, I was ahead
when hank ruined our game.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.233
So I win, right?

11:00.300 --> 11:02.067
Wrong. You
automatically lose.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.667
But I'll go
double or nothing

11:03.733 --> 11:04.933
on the ping-pong court.

11:05.067 --> 11:05.967
All right.
okay.

11:11.133 --> 11:14.400
( ping-pong continues )

11:14.467 --> 11:16.533
okay, fellas,
time to hit the hay.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.633
Knock it off.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.867
Dale:
game's not over yet.

11:19.933 --> 11:21.433
Pick it up tomorrow.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.467
Hey, man, heads up, man...

11:23.533 --> 11:24.967
Hot frito pie, man.

11:27.167 --> 11:28.933
Give me the ball, damn it.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.067
There.

11:32.833 --> 11:33.600
There.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.667
Dang it, bill, that was
my only pair of glasses.

11:38.733 --> 11:41.067
Dang it, hank,
that was our only ball.

11:43.067 --> 11:45.700
( screams )

11:45.767 --> 11:48.733
hey, man,
dang ol' scarfin' on that, man.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.133
Ha, ha, ha.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.600
My face hurts.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.200
Then, it will
match your ass

11:53.267 --> 11:54.767
when I'm done kickin' it.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.167
No fair, hank,
i'm stuck.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.267
Bill:
hey!

12:14.233 --> 12:15.600
good night.

12:15.667 --> 12:19.333
( rhythmic clacking )

12:19.400 --> 12:23.200
are you guys playing
with that busted ball now?

12:23.267 --> 12:24.333
( groans )

12:29.067 --> 12:31.067
I got bad news, men.

12:31.133 --> 12:34.700
Chet elderson died...
natural causes.

12:34.767 --> 12:36.167
Ah, what a shame.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.400
Bummer, man.
very sad.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.167
( bill passes gas )

12:40.233 --> 12:42.100
oh! For crying out loud.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.500
Dale:
come on, hank,
pick up the pace.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.800
I can't see
where I'm going.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.067
Damn you, bill.

12:52.067 --> 12:54.667
Shh... Man,
dang ol' disrespectful.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.400
Man... Lift,
bill, man.

12:56.467 --> 12:59.233
I am.
it's dale, he's faking it.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.733
Am not.

13:00.800 --> 13:02.567
Dale, no wonder
my end feels so heavy.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.867
Get your hands
on the casket.

13:04.933 --> 13:06.933
It's bad luck.

13:16.967 --> 13:20.067
Told you it was bad luck.

13:21.333 --> 13:22.700
Hank, I want to offer...

13:22.767 --> 13:23.600
Don't.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.400
I mean, I just wanted...

13:25.467 --> 13:28.267
No, you cannot speak to me
ever again.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.600
That goes for me, too, faker.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.467
Why don't you eat
some more pizza.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.267
It's all you ever
do is eat pizza.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.600
No wonder you're
bald and your
wife left you.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.767
Dang ol' amen, man.

13:38.833 --> 13:41.167
Hey, I'm burned.

13:41.233 --> 13:43.533
All of you,
go to bed.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.200
It's 4:00 in the afternoon.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.433
What did I tell you
about talking to me?

13:47.500 --> 13:49.067
Stop the fighting!

13:49.067 --> 13:52.600
This is no way to honor
the memory of chet elderson.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.367
I think I shall
honor chet's memory

13:55.433 --> 13:58.733
by plugging in
his beloved alamo beer sign.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.600
Code 44,
goobersmooches restaurant.

14:05.667 --> 14:06.900
Engine 91, respond.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.800
Code 44,
our first fire.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.500
Let's go,
move it out.

14:10.567 --> 14:12.133
huh?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.967
( siren wailing )

14:32.533 --> 14:34.633
fire's out, men.

14:34.700 --> 14:38.500
Oh. Well, that's good...
I guess.

14:38.567 --> 14:40.867
I was down the street
having a plaque made.

14:40.933 --> 14:42.667
I thought we'd
rename the station

14:42.733 --> 14:45.400
the chet elderson
firehouse--

14:45.467 --> 14:47.500
Since he didn't get
a decent burial.

14:47.567 --> 14:49.333
( pagers beeping )

14:49.400 --> 14:51.467
they're calling
all units.

14:51.533 --> 14:52.533
Where is it?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.400
Oh, my god.

14:57.067 --> 15:00.600
( siren wailing )

15:04.900 --> 15:07.400
uh, where do you
want us, chief?

15:07.467 --> 15:09.933
Back in the grave
with chet elderson.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.733
( clears throat )

15:11.800 --> 15:16.300
I hereby dedicate you
the chet elderson firehouse.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.600
Sir, I've kept a journal
of all the violations

15:20.667 --> 15:22.500
these three nincompoops
have committed

15:22.567 --> 15:24.533
and I'll be more than happy
to turn it...

15:24.600 --> 15:25.867
I've read that journal.

15:25.933 --> 15:26.800
It's all lies.

15:26.867 --> 15:28.067
Hank did it.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.567
Bill did it, too.

15:29.633 --> 15:31.367
I begged them not to.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.933
You chicken-necked
ass, I'll kill you.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.967
( screaming )

15:37.400 --> 15:39.533
oh, for heaven's sake.

15:46.100 --> 15:49.067
Well, I thought you guys
had reached your peak

15:49.100 --> 15:52.067
when you pantsed chet elderson
at his funeral

15:52.067 --> 15:53.833
but then you outdid yourself

15:53.900 --> 15:56.067
by burning down
your own firehouse!

15:56.133 --> 15:58.167
Not me. It was these screwups.

15:58.233 --> 16:01.533
Well, maybe this is
the wrong time to bring this up

16:01.600 --> 16:03.300
but we are only volunteers.

16:03.367 --> 16:06.067
We're going to go over
every minute of what happened

16:06.133 --> 16:08.533
before you lamebrains
left for goobersmooches.

16:08.600 --> 16:12.467
Then I'll know which one of you
to bring up on charges.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.333
( guys gulping )

16:14.400 --> 16:16.067
gribble, you first.

16:16.133 --> 16:18.900
Well, as usual,
I was performing

16:18.967 --> 16:22.600
rigorous fire safety checks
on the station house.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.900
( alarm beeps )

16:25.967 --> 16:30.300
bill had his face buried
in a french bread pizza.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.533
Hank was giving orders
for a change...

16:32.600 --> 16:35.433
Get yourself squared away
before I...

16:35.500 --> 16:37.767
...and boomhauer
thought being a fireman

16:37.833 --> 16:40.233
meant a chance
to work on his tan.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.867
Of course, he didn't realize

16:41.933 --> 16:44.100
his tanning lotion
had been replaced

16:44.167 --> 16:46.233
with some icy hot
hank bought

16:46.300 --> 16:50.500
for peggy's
humiliating groin pull.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.900
( chuckling )

16:52.967 --> 16:56.933
but then the fire alarm
went off, and boomhauer

16:57.067 --> 17:02.267
knocked over his tanning lamp
as he bolted upright.

17:02.333 --> 17:06.767
I raced for the fire truck
with lightning speed.

17:08.867 --> 17:12.633
Uh... Uh...
that's all I remember.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.133
No, no way, man.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.800
Ol' gribble
talkin' that crazy crap, man.

17:15.867 --> 17:17.133
I'll tell you what happened.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.300
Dang ol' truth, man.

17:18.367 --> 17:19.633
Bill, man...
threw... Flip... Boom

17:19.700 --> 17:20.967
landed right in my ear, man.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.867
( alarm beeping )

17:22.933 --> 17:25.300
hey, tell you what,
the dang ol' detector, man.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.300
Talkin' about government take
away freedom of smoke, man.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.267
Tell you what,
dang ol' yo, man. Gih.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.967
Hey, man,
i'll tell you what, man

17:32.067 --> 17:33.800
that dang ol' boy
ain't right, man.

17:33.867 --> 17:36.300
Talkin' 'bout gonna kick
that dang ol' ass, man.

17:36.367 --> 17:37.367
For god's
sakes, hank

17:37.433 --> 17:38.967
act like an adult, man.

17:39.067 --> 17:41.167
And keep it down, guys,
will you?

17:41.233 --> 17:44.700
I am trying to get through
an article on vintage camaros

17:44.767 --> 17:48.067
and I've been on the same
dang page for 20 minutes.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.800
Dang ol' pretty, pretty pizza.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.567
I'll tell you what.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.467
So, you're saying that
bill left the oven on?

17:56.533 --> 17:57.867
Bill:
not true.

17:57.933 --> 18:01.767
Okay. I have a weakness
for pizza.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.933
I, I have a lot of weaknesses,
actually

18:05.067 --> 18:09.333
but I distinctly remember
turning off the toaster oven.

18:19.967 --> 18:25.067
Let's see, uh, then I had
myself a little dessert.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.233
Oh, my.

18:27.300 --> 18:31.367
Uh... Okay. Uh... So,
i-I turned off the toaster oven

18:31.433 --> 18:33.133
just like I said.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.933
Well, what happened
after the fire alarm went off?

18:36.067 --> 18:37.233
Uh, I was in the garage

18:37.300 --> 18:38.500
getting bunkered out.

18:38.567 --> 18:40.567
Dale was on the tailboard

18:40.633 --> 18:42.333
switching the oxygen tanks.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.400
What do you mean
"switching the tanks"?

18:44.467 --> 18:46.767
Why would you switch
the oxygen tanks?

18:46.833 --> 18:48.467
Oh, let's face it.

18:48.533 --> 18:52.100
Me, bill and boomhauer
had no idea what we were doing.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.433
You're the only real
fireman among us.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.600
I saw your tank
was running low.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.267
Mine was full,
and I knew

18:58.333 --> 19:00.767
you'd need every
molecule of oxygen

19:00.833 --> 19:02.600
to carry
our charred bodies

19:02.667 --> 19:04.367
out of that
raging inferno.

19:04.433 --> 19:05.967
So, the fire

19:06.067 --> 19:07.967
could've been caused

19:08.067 --> 19:10.933
by gribble's smoking,
boomhauer's tanning

19:11.067 --> 19:13.333
or dauterive's
incessant cooking.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.333
It could've been,
but it wasn't

19:15.400 --> 19:17.333
and I'll tell you
why it wasn't

19:17.400 --> 19:18.933
i'll tell you what.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.433
We had finally realized
our boyhood dreams.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.700
We had become firefighters,
'cept instead of fighting fires

19:24.767 --> 19:27.333
we were busy fighting each other.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.500
Anyway,the fire alarm went off...

19:37.533 --> 19:39.133
...and I sprung into action.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.700
I switched off the lamp

19:40.767 --> 19:44.333
turned off the stove
and put out the cigarette.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.100
I ran toward the fire truck

19:46.167 --> 19:48.500
and I saw dale
fiddling in the back.

19:48.567 --> 19:52.300
I didn't know that he was busy
switching the oxygen tanks.

19:52.367 --> 19:53.833
Awfully nice thing of him to do

19:53.900 --> 19:55.800
since we weren't even
on speaking terms.

19:55.867 --> 19:57.133
Dale:
still aren't.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.367
Then I put my blinker on
to pull out.

19:59.433 --> 20:01.333
Wait a minute.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.967
I remember seeing some kind
of yellow light in the mirror.

20:06.033 --> 20:07.633
I know what caused the fire.

20:07.700 --> 20:11.167
Somebody plugged in
that stupid alamo beer sign.

20:11.233 --> 20:13.533
And I'll tell you
who that somebody had to be.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.667
( gibbering )

20:14.733 --> 20:17.667
that somebody had to be...

20:19.200 --> 20:22.333
( gibbering louder )

20:22.400 --> 20:23.767
chet elderson.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.533
I did not...
chet elderson!

20:25.600 --> 20:28.500
Yep. Chet was always trying
to plug it in.

20:28.567 --> 20:30.033
He loved that sign.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.300
But the dang thing
didn't work right.

20:32.367 --> 20:33.633
It threw off sparks

20:33.700 --> 20:35.967
and, well, it was just
a real fire hazard.

20:36.033 --> 20:37.733
Isn't that right, dale?

20:37.800 --> 20:41.733
Uh, yes. Chet elderson must
have plugged that sign in

20:41.800 --> 20:44.400
the last time he
was at the station.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.333
What a moron-- may,
may he rest in peace.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.933
Right, bill?

20:49.000 --> 20:51.033
R-right. Yeah, that
sounds like chet.

20:53.233 --> 20:55.733
Tell you what, man
draggin' ol' chet's name
through the mud, man.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.733
Ol' dale's
the one that did it, man.

20:57.800 --> 20:59.133
Leave ol' chet alone, man.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.500
So, each and every one of you

21:01.567 --> 21:05.100
believes that chet elderson
started that fire.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.833
Well, it doesn't surprise me.

21:08.900 --> 21:12.400
I told him a half a dozen times
not to plug in that sign.

21:12.467 --> 21:14.067
( relieved groaning )

21:14.067 --> 21:15.333
I don't know.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.500
Chet was one heck
of a fireman.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.567
I hate to soil
his good name.

21:19.633 --> 21:23.367
Well, guess we could
just call it an electrical fire.

21:23.433 --> 21:24.833
Accidents do happen.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.167
Good idea.

21:26.233 --> 21:27.367
That's
what we'll do.

21:27.433 --> 21:30.733
You're free to go.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.500
Well, I heard
mrs. Throckmorton's

21:34.567 --> 21:36.100
looking to hire
four plumbers.

21:36.167 --> 21:37.233
no.

21:37.300 --> 21:38.867
It's all the beer we can drink.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.600
Uh, okay. I could use a beer.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.067
yup.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.133
yup.

21:46.200 --> 21:47.533
Mm-hmm.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.433
Okay.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.633
( grunting )

22:16.367 --> 22:18.667
( grunting )

22:22.500 --> 22:24.100
oh, yeah!

22:24.167 --> 22:25.633
Whoo!

22:25.700 --> 22:28.067
( grunting )

22:28.100 --> 22:30.700
dale:
bicky-bi-be-bo-bo,
bicky-bi-bo!
