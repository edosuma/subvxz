WEBVTT

00:01.318 --> 00:03.002
Someone who had access
to privileged information

00:03.079 --> 00:06.005
tipped off the activists
on a case being brought
by Legal Aid,

00:06.082 --> 00:07.414
<i>  where my live-in girlfriend</i>
<i>  works.</i>

00:07.491 --> 00:10.417
Whether you meant it or not,
you ruined me, Callie.

00:12.255 --> 00:13.829
I've been offered first chair

00:13.906 --> 00:17.241
with the
Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra
in Amsterdam.

00:17.243 --> 00:18.242
-Oh, my gosh.
-What!

00:18.244 --> 00:19.518
I want everyone
to know about you.

00:19.595 --> 00:22.079
You don't have
to come out
to your parents for me.

00:22.081 --> 00:25.916
If you want to go
to Venezuela,
you have my blessing.

00:25.918 --> 00:27.752
I want you to have
your new chapter too.

00:27.754 --> 00:28.602
You're pressing charges
against Jerod?

00:28.679 --> 00:30.679
I was doing it
to protect him.

00:30.757 --> 00:32.365
Gina:
<i>  White supremacists,</i>

00:32.441 --> 00:33.699
<i>  they're using our app</i>
<i>  to spread their hate.</i>

00:33.776 --> 00:35.534
Go back to Mexico.

00:35.611 --> 00:36.777
-We can't shut it down.
-It's your company.

00:36.854 --> 00:38.654
<i>  But I can't be</i>
<i>  a part of it anymore.</i>

00:43.286 --> 00:44.860
Okay,
maybe you're right.

00:44.937 --> 00:46.437
Maybe I--
I shouldn't be here.

00:46.439 --> 00:48.272
I have to be there.

00:48.274 --> 00:50.775
Brandon and Eliza
are going away for a year.

00:50.777 --> 00:52.293
And it might be
the last time I see Mom

00:52.369 --> 00:53.201
-before she goes to Venezuela.
-Right.

00:53.279 --> 00:55.537
Of course, I have no idea

00:55.615 --> 00:57.223
if Jamie's parents know
that we broke up or why.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.967
If they do know why,
they're gonna hate me.

01:00.044 --> 01:01.452
I don't even know
if I'm welcome.

01:01.454 --> 01:04.397
It's not like
they loved you before.

01:04.473 --> 01:05.231
What if Jamie lost his job
because of me?

01:07.126 --> 01:08.309
-Would you regret
what you did?
-No!

01:09.629 --> 01:10.978
But I know he's angry.

01:11.055 --> 01:11.737
And so am I, by the way.

01:13.724 --> 01:15.408
If he hadn't pressed charges
against Jerod,

01:15.484 --> 01:16.634
he never would've been
beaten in jail,

01:16.636 --> 01:17.802
or be facing a felony.

01:17.804 --> 01:19.227
Wait, does Jamie
know about that?

01:19.305 --> 01:19.903
I have no idea.

01:21.641 --> 01:23.749
But he's gonna know
when I tell him.

01:23.826 --> 01:24.325
Maybe you're right.
Maybe you shouldn't go.

01:25.995 --> 01:28.236
No, you have to go.
We're already here.

01:28.314 --> 01:29.814
(sighs)

01:29.816 --> 01:30.831
Who cares
who knows what

01:30.908 --> 01:32.333
or what
anyone thinks?

01:32.409 --> 01:33.500
We're two
grown-ass women, okay?

01:33.577 --> 01:33.917
We don't have
to answer to anyone.

01:35.746 --> 01:37.263
But FYI,
don't tell Moms or anyone
that I'm dating Evan.

01:38.324 --> 01:39.715
(doorbell rings)

01:42.419 --> 01:42.926
<i>  Verwelkoming!</i>

02:06.869 --> 02:08.352
So...

02:08.354 --> 02:12.189
in honor of
Brandon and Eliza's
Amsterdam adventure,

02:12.191 --> 02:13.374
I thought a Dutch theme
was in order.

02:14.377 --> 02:16.302
How fun!

02:16.379 --> 02:17.953
I love your clogs.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.171
Oh, thanks.

02:19.248 --> 02:20.297
Your costumes and clogs
are in Jim's study.

02:22.051 --> 02:23.217
Our costumes?

02:23.293 --> 02:24.718
Yes!
We're all dressing up.

02:24.795 --> 02:25.552
Right down the hall.

02:27.390 --> 02:27.971
Go get changed!

02:30.376 --> 02:30.599
So, when are we
gonna drop this bomb?

02:31.544 --> 02:33.301
At the very last
minute.

02:33.379 --> 02:35.488
My mom went
to so much trouble.

02:35.564 --> 02:37.715
As much as I'd like
to ditch these costumes,

02:37.717 --> 02:38.607
I don't wanna
ruin her party.

02:43.890 --> 02:47.333
Hey, so
before everyone
gets here,

02:47.410 --> 02:48.242
I wanted to tell you
I made a big decision.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.120
You're coming out
to your parents?

02:52.064 --> 02:52.671
Not that big.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.008
I applied to transfer to UCLA

02:56.085 --> 02:56.233
and got accepted.

02:57.737 --> 02:59.345
We don't have to do
this long-distance thing
anymore.

03:02.742 --> 03:04.425
(dramatic music playing)

03:18.591 --> 03:19.031
I love you.

03:20.426 --> 03:20.866
I love you too.

03:27.433 --> 03:28.857
Connor?

03:28.935 --> 03:29.950
What are you doing here?

03:31.454 --> 03:32.786
I'm working the party.

03:32.863 --> 03:33.771
But I thought
you lived in LA.

03:33.773 --> 03:35.606
I go to UC Irvine.

03:35.608 --> 03:37.032
I got a baseball
scholarship here.

03:37.109 --> 03:39.868
-What are you up to?
-Uh, I'm at UCLA.

03:39.946 --> 03:41.128
UCLA, that's cool.

03:41.205 --> 03:42.947
Uh, what are you doing here?

03:42.949 --> 03:44.631
Oh, sorry. Uh...

03:44.708 --> 03:45.540
Carter,
uh, this is Connor.

03:45.618 --> 03:47.542
Hey.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.303
Brandon married
Carter's sister.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.396
And this is
their parents' house.

03:50.473 --> 03:51.546
That's cool.

03:51.624 --> 03:52.389
Um...

03:55.886 --> 03:56.393
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

03:57.554 --> 03:58.145
I'll have a beer.

03:59.556 --> 04:01.574
-Same.
-Got it.

04:01.650 --> 04:02.649
By the way,
I like the hair.

04:06.806 --> 04:07.471
Where do you know him from?

04:07.473 --> 04:08.581
Uh...

04:09.825 --> 04:11.033
he's just a friend
from middle school.

04:16.740 --> 04:19.425
Diane:
Oh, so perfect!

04:19.502 --> 04:21.001
There you are.

04:21.078 --> 04:22.595
Don't you all
just look adorable!

04:24.323 --> 04:27.049
(indistinct conversation)

04:28.995 --> 04:30.327
(softly) Um...
You could've warned us.

04:30.329 --> 04:32.271
We were afraid
you wouldn't come.

04:32.348 --> 04:33.772
(doorbell rings)

04:33.849 --> 04:35.257
Oh, that must be
Lena and Stef.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.609
And on time. Almost.

04:37.837 --> 04:38.944
-Jim?
-Yes.

04:41.674 --> 04:43.524
I can't wait
to see their faces.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.618
And their costumes.

04:45.694 --> 04:48.270
So, um, Diane
obviously doesn't know

04:48.347 --> 04:49.604
that Jamie and I broke up.

04:49.682 --> 04:50.739
Actually, she does.

04:51.700 --> 04:52.282
Oh.

04:53.519 --> 04:54.793
Hence,
the warm welcome.

04:54.870 --> 04:57.204
Hmm. Well,
she obviously
doesn't know

04:57.281 --> 04:58.631
why you broke up.

04:58.707 --> 04:59.206
Hence,
the warm welcome.

05:02.211 --> 05:03.877
Um, did you warn
Moms at least?

05:06.866 --> 05:07.956
There is no way in hell
I'm dressing up

05:08.034 --> 05:08.757
like a Dutch milkmaid.

05:10.127 --> 05:11.218
It's for Brandon and Eliza.

05:11.295 --> 05:12.870
It's for Diane,
and you know that.

05:12.872 --> 05:15.147
I swear,
one of these days,
I'm gonna tell that woman

05:15.224 --> 05:16.131
exactly what
I think of her.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.392
Not this day, please.

05:18.468 --> 05:18.817
I don't know about this.

05:20.713 --> 05:22.396
Oh, I think
you look very handsome.

05:22.472 --> 05:26.325
Sweetheart, you do not have
to wear this, you know that.

05:26.402 --> 05:27.609
Yeah I do,
it's for Brandon and Eliza.

05:31.481 --> 05:32.723
Hey, can I talk
to you about something?

05:32.725 --> 05:34.408
What's up?

05:34.484 --> 05:35.576
(gasps)
Oh, my God! Corey!

05:35.652 --> 05:37.394
Hey!

05:37.396 --> 05:38.671
Mariana:
What?

05:38.747 --> 05:39.913
-Oh, you're so tall!
-What's up?

05:39.990 --> 05:42.341
-I've missed you, bud.
-I miss you too.

05:42.418 --> 05:42.833
-You're so big!
-I know!

05:44.070 --> 05:45.678
Hey, he was supposed
to be the surprise.

05:45.754 --> 05:47.237
But look at this!

05:47.239 --> 05:49.923
Ah! You all look darling!

05:50.000 --> 05:52.242
And, Stef, I heard
about your back surgery

05:52.244 --> 05:54.411
so I wasn't sure
you'd be comfortable
in clogs

05:54.413 --> 05:55.512
so I got you
a pair of Staphorsts.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.524
Thank you, Diane.

05:58.601 --> 05:59.850
Yes, it was very
thoughtful of you.

06:01.845 --> 06:04.271
Oh, and I've got another
special surprise later.

06:04.348 --> 06:04.938
Woo. More special
than this? That's--

06:06.926 --> 06:07.691
Thank you.

06:08.611 --> 06:10.444
Anyone like a Genever cocktail?

06:10.520 --> 06:12.037
Oh.

06:12.114 --> 06:13.947
Moms, you remember Connor?

06:14.024 --> 06:15.099
Oh, my God.

06:15.101 --> 06:18.711
(excited chatter)

06:18.787 --> 06:20.362
-I barely recognized you.
-So grown up.

06:20.439 --> 06:23.273
So, how do you all
know Connor?

06:23.275 --> 06:23.957
Oh, he was
Jude's first boyfriend.

06:26.779 --> 06:27.669
Oh.

06:34.303 --> 06:36.286
Where is everybody?

06:36.288 --> 06:37.955
Mom took everyone
on the tour.

06:37.957 --> 06:39.398
Of course she did.

06:39.475 --> 06:40.682
And, yes, Callie's here.

06:44.130 --> 06:48.148
Diane:
...which, you'll see,
sparkles like gold at sunset.

06:48.225 --> 06:50.576
Ah! There he is.

06:50.653 --> 06:53.487
Or at least,
I think that's my son

06:53.563 --> 06:54.805
behind all this facial hair.

06:54.807 --> 06:57.249
I see you've
outdone yourself again,
Mother.

06:57.326 --> 06:57.916
Diane:
I've got a costume
for you too.

06:57.993 --> 07:00.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:00.237 --> 07:02.980
-You look all right.
-Yeah, I know. Thank you.

07:02.982 --> 07:03.997
-Hey, man. Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

07:04.074 --> 07:05.482
This is Corey,
our former foster son.

07:05.484 --> 07:09.094
Yeah, we met
at Brandon and Eliza's
engagement party.

07:09.171 --> 07:10.487
-Good to see you, man.
-Good to see you too.

07:10.489 --> 07:12.005
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

07:12.082 --> 07:13.674
Nice to see you.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.100
Ooh, a double hug!

07:15.177 --> 07:15.917
-Hi.
-How are you?

07:15.995 --> 07:16.435
Good.

07:18.497 --> 07:18.937
Hello.

07:20.349 --> 07:22.499
Well, now that
we're all here,

07:22.501 --> 07:23.425
why don't we
take a seat at the table?

07:23.502 --> 07:25.093
What about
Jamie's costume?

07:25.171 --> 07:26.061
Oh, he can change later.

07:28.691 --> 07:29.448
You okay,
seeing Connor again?

07:30.843 --> 07:31.599
Yeah. Fine.

07:31.677 --> 07:33.193
What a coincidence,
huh?

07:33.270 --> 07:35.270
Or fate.

07:35.347 --> 07:35.862
Well, you never
really get over
your first love.

07:37.516 --> 07:38.849
That mean you're
not over Max Steinbrecker?

07:38.851 --> 07:40.701
(chuckles)
You were my first real love.

07:40.777 --> 07:42.853
Gah!
Don't I wanna hear.

07:42.855 --> 07:44.779
You know, I remember
how heartbroken you were

07:44.857 --> 07:46.373
when he left.

07:46.450 --> 07:47.949
Ooh. I wonder
if he's single.

07:48.027 --> 07:49.543
Maybe you can
get back together?

07:49.619 --> 07:51.786
It's not gonna happen,
okay?

07:51.864 --> 07:54.531
Diane:
Everyone, please
find your place cards.

07:54.533 --> 07:55.882
I've assigned seating.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.552
(traditional Dutch music
playing)

07:58.628 --> 07:59.478
(indistinct conversation)

08:05.878 --> 08:06.819
Lena:
How's the weather
all the way down there?

08:06.895 --> 08:09.488
(all laughing)

08:09.565 --> 08:11.565
You look like
a '70s porn star.

08:11.641 --> 08:14.142
(light laughter)

08:14.220 --> 08:15.327
What do the partners
at your law firm
think of that thing?

08:16.722 --> 08:18.613
Well, I don't know.
I don't work there anymore.

08:20.559 --> 08:21.500
What do you mean?
What happened?

08:22.728 --> 08:23.836
I quit.

08:24.897 --> 08:27.080
Why?

08:27.157 --> 08:28.915
I wasn't happy
with the track I was on.

08:28.992 --> 08:29.833
So I'm looking
for new opportunities.

08:31.495 --> 08:32.010
Such as?

08:33.088 --> 08:33.503
I don't know yet.

08:35.407 --> 08:37.165
-Hey, can you take five?
-(music stops)

08:37.243 --> 08:38.350
Please, thank you.

08:41.263 --> 08:43.580
Son, you never
quit a job

08:43.582 --> 08:45.098
without another offer
in the wings.

08:45.175 --> 08:47.025
Maybe he doesn't know
what he wants to do next.

08:47.102 --> 08:47.809
So you don't quit
until you do.

08:49.421 --> 08:50.362
Well, you know,
I-- I just quit my job.

08:51.924 --> 08:52.147
And Callie
just quit hers.

08:54.927 --> 08:55.692
Diane:
You quit your clerkship?

08:59.615 --> 09:01.039
Sorry, I was talking
about your other job.

09:03.193 --> 09:03.208
Well, how many jobs
have you quit?

09:04.694 --> 09:08.046
Um, well,
I decided to leave
my clerkship early

09:08.123 --> 09:08.272
to work
at Legal Aid.

09:09.942 --> 09:13.668
And now I'm working for
a very highly regarded
defense attorney.

09:15.948 --> 09:16.213
When did this happen?

09:18.133 --> 09:19.966
Recently. I was, uh,
gonna tell you guys today.

09:21.711 --> 09:22.511
Jim:
Mariana, why did you quit?

09:24.123 --> 09:25.380
Didn't you just launch an app?
That, uh...

09:25.457 --> 09:28.959
You know,
that activism thing.
What was it called?

09:28.961 --> 09:31.478
It was overrun
by white supremacists,
so...

09:31.555 --> 09:32.354
Mm. Anyone I know?
(chuckles)

09:35.818 --> 09:38.226
I am kidding

09:38.304 --> 09:40.304
of course.

09:40.306 --> 09:40.746
You know,
it's actually not funny.

09:42.491 --> 09:44.991
Um, those people
verbally attacked Mariana

09:45.068 --> 09:46.585
and yelled
horrible things at her.

09:46.662 --> 09:47.702
I'm sorry,
when did this happen?

09:48.905 --> 09:49.704
It was nothing.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.336
Is everybody ready
for<i>  snert?</i>

09:56.413 --> 09:57.912
-Yes.
-Yes.

09:57.990 --> 09:59.080
Stef:
<i>  Snert,</i>  what is that?

09:59.158 --> 10:01.825
Diane:
It's Holland's version
of pea soup.

10:01.827 --> 10:03.101
It's more of a stew actually,

10:03.178 --> 10:06.847
with pork and celery,
onions and leeks.

10:06.923 --> 10:07.597
Jim:
Mmm. Mmm.

10:11.003 --> 10:11.726
So, I'm transferring to UCLA.

10:12.838 --> 10:13.395
No.

10:14.431 --> 10:15.505
No?

10:15.507 --> 10:17.357
No.

10:17.434 --> 10:18.116
-Can we talk about it?
-No!

10:19.511 --> 10:20.935
No, you are not transferring

10:21.013 --> 10:22.362
from an Ivy League school
to a state school.

10:23.682 --> 10:26.608
Could we sidebar
this conversation until later?

10:26.685 --> 10:27.284
And why the hell UCLA?

10:29.112 --> 10:30.854
They have
a good film program.

10:30.856 --> 10:33.857
-Film?
-Really, now is not the time.

10:33.859 --> 10:35.950
This is Brandon and Eliza's
going-away party.

10:36.028 --> 10:37.252
Oh! And yours too, Stef!

10:38.864 --> 10:39.972
In honor of your adventure,

10:40.048 --> 10:42.624
we're having flan
as one of our desserts.

10:42.701 --> 10:44.125
Yeah, I'm not paying
for my son to study film.

10:44.203 --> 10:45.960
Jim!

10:46.038 --> 10:46.553
It's always about money.

10:46.630 --> 10:48.146
Oh, my!

10:48.223 --> 10:50.223
Could we please
just enjoy our<i>  snert</i>  ?

10:56.473 --> 10:57.480
<i>  Snert</i>  is delicious, Diane.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.308
Thank you, Lena.

11:00.386 --> 11:02.886
(traditional Dutch yodeling)

11:02.888 --> 11:04.738
♪

11:09.486 --> 11:11.986
Diane:
So, we've been eating
<i>  stamppot</i>  and<i>  bitterballen.</i>

11:12.064 --> 11:14.989
<i>  Stamppot</i>  is potatoes
mashed with vegetables,

11:15.067 --> 11:17.342
and<i>  bitterballen</i>
<i> </i> is fried meat balls.

11:17.419 --> 11:18.677
Well, the Dutch
sure do love a hearty meal.

11:18.754 --> 11:22.589
-Mmm.
-Diane: I just love
sampling new cuisines.

11:22.666 --> 11:24.182
Jim and I are using this
as an excuse

11:24.259 --> 11:25.500
to go to Europe
for a month.

11:25.577 --> 11:26.834
First stop, Amsterdam,

11:26.912 --> 11:30.856
to see Eliza
in the Concertgebouw,
of course.

11:30.933 --> 11:32.432
Jim's been working
so hard this year.

11:32.509 --> 11:33.767
We're really
looking forward to it.

11:33.843 --> 11:36.028
Yeah. So, uh, Stef,

11:36.104 --> 11:36.770
when do you leave
for Nicaragua?

11:38.181 --> 11:39.865
Uh, Venezuela.

11:39.942 --> 11:42.259
And, um,
I leave in about 10 days.

11:42.261 --> 11:44.761
You're so brave
venturing out all alone.

11:44.763 --> 11:46.688
I can't even imagine.

11:46.765 --> 11:48.598
Well, I'm actually
very excited

11:48.600 --> 11:49.691
to start this new chapter
of my life.

11:49.768 --> 11:51.192
Jim:
You're not worried?

11:51.270 --> 11:54.212
With, uh, you know,
the economic disaster
in Venezuela?

11:54.289 --> 11:56.381
I've heard it's very dangerous
for foreign travelers,

11:56.458 --> 11:58.291
especially Americans.

11:58.368 --> 12:00.368
What if you get
kidnapped for ransom?

12:00.446 --> 12:02.279
Jim! Don't scare her.

12:02.281 --> 12:03.555
Well, maybe
she should be scared.

12:03.632 --> 12:06.558
Stef:
Well, I-- I appreciate
your concern, Jim, I do.

12:06.635 --> 12:09.210
But the whole point in going
is the country is in crisis.

12:09.288 --> 12:10.787
You know,
there's a million kids

12:10.789 --> 12:13.457
whose parents were forced
to migrate out of the country

12:13.459 --> 12:14.791
to find jobs
and leave them behind.

12:14.793 --> 12:17.461
You know,
that is what happens
with socialism.

12:17.463 --> 12:19.980
Of course,
so-called progressives

12:20.056 --> 12:21.631
want to bring that failure
here to America.

12:21.633 --> 12:23.066
You mean, like
Social Security and Medicare?

12:24.636 --> 12:25.652
Diane: No politics
at the table, dear.

12:25.729 --> 12:28.138
Hey, no, no, no.
I'm only stating facts--

12:28.140 --> 12:28.747
Please, Dad. Not now.

12:29.825 --> 12:32.325
Why not?
You're a proud Republican.

12:32.402 --> 12:32.993
Oh, I'm actually
an Independent now.

12:36.648 --> 12:37.247
Huh!

12:39.075 --> 12:41.242
So, Lena,

12:41.320 --> 12:42.544
what are you working on
in Sacramento?

12:43.839 --> 12:45.580
Housing and homelessness

12:45.657 --> 12:47.507
are the big issues statewide
right now.

12:47.584 --> 12:51.177
Jim:
What about this proposed
wealth and exit tax bill

12:51.254 --> 12:52.253
I'm hearing about?

12:52.331 --> 12:53.772
Diane: Jim!

12:53.849 --> 12:55.757
Lena:
Well, that's for people

12:55.834 --> 12:57.109
who earn 30 million or more.

12:57.185 --> 13:00.261
The idea is that
they amassed
most of that wealth

13:00.339 --> 13:00.946
while in California.

13:03.675 --> 13:06.100
Jim:
Well, it is unconstitutional.

13:06.178 --> 13:09.346
You know,
you're a prisoner of California

13:09.348 --> 13:10.864
if you, uh,
even after you move out.

13:12.534 --> 13:14.793
Lena:
Well, with so many people
amassing wealth in the state,

13:14.870 --> 13:17.445
it's shrinking by billions.

13:17.523 --> 13:17.954
It's like a hit and run.

13:22.044 --> 13:25.620
Jim:
You know, it's also like
the "Hotel California."

13:25.697 --> 13:27.030
You can check out
any time you like

13:27.032 --> 13:28.456
and you can even leave,

13:28.534 --> 13:29.883
but you'll never stop
paying taxes.

13:31.294 --> 13:34.479
So, it's no wonder
that people and businesses

13:34.556 --> 13:36.389
are leaving in droves when

13:36.466 --> 13:38.650
they're, you know,

13:38.727 --> 13:39.985
trying to raise
our personal taxes

13:40.062 --> 13:42.303
and income taxes

13:42.381 --> 13:44.472
to 16.8%, you know?

13:44.550 --> 13:46.641
Not to mention the sales tax.

13:46.718 --> 13:47.400
Diane: I think
you've made your point.

13:50.889 --> 13:52.739
Could we please
put our phones down

13:52.816 --> 13:53.323
and enjoy the conversation?

13:55.243 --> 13:55.450
Carter:
What's to enjoy?

13:57.062 --> 13:58.411
See? Change the subject.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.655
Okay, okay.

14:00.732 --> 14:01.339
Uh...

14:02.734 --> 14:03.991
So, uh, Callie,

14:04.069 --> 14:07.161
why the switch
to criminal law?

14:07.239 --> 14:08.088
Jude:
Wasn't it because of
that homeless guy

14:08.164 --> 14:10.164
that walked
into your apartment?

14:10.242 --> 14:11.833
I'm sorry, a homeless guy
went into the Coterie?

14:11.910 --> 14:14.669
No, um,
it was Jamie's apartment.

14:14.746 --> 14:17.747
-What?
-Callie: It wasn't
like a criminal thing.

14:17.749 --> 14:21.434
You know, this guy, Jerod,
he was having an episode.

14:21.511 --> 14:23.420
He's fine
when he's on his meds.

14:23.422 --> 14:24.437
But he's in jail, right?

14:24.514 --> 14:25.697
He got arrested,

14:27.943 --> 14:29.025
and he got
beaten in jail.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.687
He refused
to come out of his cell

14:32.764 --> 14:35.265
because they weren't
giving him his medication,

14:35.267 --> 14:39.619
so they pepper sprayed him
and started hitting him.

14:39.696 --> 14:43.197
And he struck a guard back,
uh, in self-defense.

14:43.275 --> 14:45.050
So now they're charging him
with a felony.

14:46.870 --> 14:48.962
-That's messed up.
-Callie: I know.

14:49.038 --> 14:50.889
So this attorney
that I'm working for,

14:50.966 --> 14:53.133
um, she's
one of the best in LA.

14:53.209 --> 14:57.011
Uh, she agreed to take his case
if I would come work for her.

14:59.048 --> 15:02.067
You know, I really admire
that your family seems
called to serve.

15:03.629 --> 15:05.462
When we washed
homeless people's feet

15:05.464 --> 15:06.738
at the commune
Christmas party,

15:06.815 --> 15:08.798
I found it very...
enlightening.

15:08.800 --> 15:09.232
Thank you.

15:10.652 --> 15:12.318
When you think
about homeless people,

15:12.395 --> 15:14.696
you never think
about the wear and tear
on their feet, you know?

15:18.735 --> 15:20.493
Yeah. We don't.

15:23.072 --> 15:24.330
(indistinct conversation)

15:29.504 --> 15:30.003
-(knock on door)
-It's Stef.

15:30.079 --> 15:30.929
Come in.

15:34.159 --> 15:37.160
Oh, my goodness.
Argh!

15:37.162 --> 15:38.178
The best thing
about leaving the country

15:38.254 --> 15:41.164
is not having
to see Jim and Diane.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.440
What is that hat?
What the heck is this?

15:44.169 --> 15:45.593
So you're not just,
uh, escaping me?

15:45.671 --> 15:49.281
What?
I'll come see you,
you'll come see me.

15:49.357 --> 15:50.448
Is that really why
you think I'm going?

15:50.525 --> 15:54.010
No, but we've
never been apart

15:54.012 --> 15:56.346
for such huge
chunks of time before.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.623
That's why we should have
as much sex as possible
before I go.

16:02.688 --> 16:03.962
(sighs)

16:04.039 --> 16:05.622
What? Oh, wow, big sigh.

16:06.950 --> 16:09.301
Should we worry
about our kids
being quitters?

16:09.377 --> 16:11.027
Quitters?
What are you
talking about?

16:11.029 --> 16:13.972
Callie has quit two jobs
in the last six months,

16:14.049 --> 16:15.048
and a relationship.

16:15.124 --> 16:17.383
Mariana's quit her job.

16:17.460 --> 16:19.202
Brandon quit his internship
to go with Eliza.

16:19.204 --> 16:21.963
I mean, is this just
like a millennial thing or--

16:22.040 --> 16:23.223
Are they millennials
or Gen Z'ers?

16:23.299 --> 16:25.391
-I'm not-- I don't know.
-I have no idea.

16:25.468 --> 16:26.151
-I'm so--
-(knock on door)

16:27.395 --> 16:28.728
-It's Mariana.
-both: Come in.

16:30.398 --> 16:31.606
Hey, what's going on?

16:32.901 --> 16:33.149
both: Taking a break.

16:34.978 --> 16:35.485
So...

16:36.980 --> 16:39.647
Why didn't you tell us
about the white supremacists?

16:39.725 --> 16:42.909
Um, I just didn't want
to upset you.

16:42.986 --> 16:44.002
Okay. What exactly happened,
honey?

16:46.322 --> 16:50.658
A bunch of guys asked me
if I was from Brown Lives Matter

16:50.736 --> 16:52.043
and told me
to go back to Mexico.

16:53.997 --> 16:54.837
-But it wasn't a big deal.
-Honey...

16:57.333 --> 16:59.008
I know you wanna be strong,
but words hurt.

17:00.169 --> 17:01.335
You did not deserve
to hear that.

17:01.413 --> 17:02.837
Trust me, I know.

17:02.914 --> 17:05.582
You know,
you were absolutely right
to quit Speckulate

17:05.584 --> 17:07.250
when your boss
wouldn't shut down the app.

17:07.252 --> 17:07.809
Sweetheart, okay?
What's wrong with that guy?

17:10.272 --> 17:11.863
Well, you know,
to be fair,

17:11.940 --> 17:14.866
I didn't tell him what
personally happened to me

17:14.943 --> 17:17.869
and, you know,
he has to answer
to his board. So--

17:17.946 --> 17:19.095
It's no excuse, honey.
No excuse.

17:19.097 --> 17:20.521
He was wrong.
Period.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.931
(knock on door)

17:21.933 --> 17:22.865
-It's me. Callie.
-all: Come in.

17:26.955 --> 17:28.029
What's going on in here?

17:28.106 --> 17:28.788
all: Taking a break.

17:32.444 --> 17:34.168
So, how is it,
seeing Jamie?

17:35.447 --> 17:36.796
Fine.

17:36.873 --> 17:38.448
-Lena: Mm-hmm?
-Mm-hmm.

17:38.450 --> 17:40.225
Well, you did not
exactly tell us

17:40.302 --> 17:40.800
why you and Jamie
broke up.

17:45.214 --> 17:47.307
Carter:
So, you don't want me
to transfer to UCLA?

17:50.145 --> 17:51.236
Is that the deal?

17:51.313 --> 17:52.219
Jude:
No, it's not.

17:52.297 --> 17:53.387
I just don't want
to feel like

17:53.465 --> 17:55.648
I'm the only reason
why you're transferring.

17:55.725 --> 17:57.391
Well you're not.

17:57.469 --> 17:58.234
They have
a great film school.

18:00.730 --> 18:02.322
It's not like
we can't still hook up
with other people...

18:04.525 --> 18:05.232
if that's what's
freaking you out.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.743
I'm not freaking out.

18:09.072 --> 18:10.738
Oh, uh, sorry.

18:10.816 --> 18:12.999
It's fine.

18:13.076 --> 18:14.000
Why don't you two
catch up?

18:21.660 --> 18:22.342
So, you and Carter...

18:24.253 --> 18:24.886
You guys, like, a thing?

18:26.181 --> 18:27.722
Um, yeah.

18:29.000 --> 18:29.557
But...

18:31.503 --> 18:33.427
he's not out
to his parents.

18:33.505 --> 18:34.228
That's rough.

18:36.191 --> 18:36.356
I remember
how hard it was for me.

18:38.193 --> 18:40.276
And I also remember
I couldn't have done it
without you.

18:43.606 --> 18:44.113
How are things
with your dad?

18:45.441 --> 18:46.532
Eh, okay. Now.

18:48.520 --> 18:48.793
Took a while.

18:51.706 --> 18:54.023
I'm really sorry
that I hurt you

18:54.025 --> 18:54.466
when I moved to LA.

18:57.362 --> 18:58.544
I just had
to get away from my dad.

18:59.531 --> 19:00.380
I know.

19:01.533 --> 19:02.140
Now.

19:04.035 --> 19:04.884
It was just hard
back then.

19:04.961 --> 19:06.644
Yeah,

19:06.721 --> 19:07.812
and the long-distance thing
was hard too.

19:09.298 --> 19:11.724
I just wish
we hadn't broken up
the way we did.

19:14.546 --> 19:15.061
I should have handled
the whole thing better.

19:15.138 --> 19:16.396
Me too.

19:18.474 --> 19:20.233
Maybe...
we can be friends again?

19:21.903 --> 19:22.443
I'd love that.

19:23.388 --> 19:24.070
Good.

19:27.242 --> 19:29.742
<i>  ♪ So even when you think</i>
<i>  I'm hazy ♪</i>

19:31.730 --> 19:34.898
<i>  ♪ Just be there,</i>
<i>  Just be there ♪</i>

19:34.900 --> 19:36.508
<i>  ♪ Just be there ♪</i>

19:38.737 --> 19:41.921

19:46.669 --> 19:48.853
<i>  ♪ So I'm coming back to you ♪</i>

19:54.769 --> 19:56.194
You know, they were lying
to the tenants,

19:56.271 --> 20:00.181
and I-- I felt like
I had to tip them off,

20:00.258 --> 20:01.441
and Jamie lost the deal.

20:01.517 --> 20:02.358
And maybe his job.

20:04.262 --> 20:04.702
Though he said he quit.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.031
-Do you think
what I did was wrong?
-No.

20:10.936 --> 20:12.452
Do you?

20:12.528 --> 20:14.103
-Maybe.
-No, you don't.

20:14.105 --> 20:16.622
Let your sister
speak for herself,
Miss Thing, please.

20:16.699 --> 20:17.165
-Thank you.
-Fine.

20:19.110 --> 20:20.718
I thought
what I was doing
was right, but...

20:22.280 --> 20:24.881
if I'd have known that
it would end the relationship...

20:27.043 --> 20:27.058
I don't know.

20:28.544 --> 20:30.954
Honey, we can tell you
that you did the right thing,

20:30.956 --> 20:32.638
and I think you did,

20:32.715 --> 20:34.548
but it's not gonna make you
feel any better

20:34.626 --> 20:34.807
unless you feel
that way as well.

20:36.811 --> 20:37.560
Obviously, it's not
'cause it keeps coming up.

20:39.481 --> 20:40.855
But I'm not talking.

20:43.134 --> 20:44.150
Stef:
It's really difficult,
sweetheart,

20:44.227 --> 20:45.468
to be in a relationship

20:45.470 --> 20:46.970
with someone
who's so different
than you are.

20:46.972 --> 20:48.304
That's why you have
to decide

20:48.306 --> 20:49.247
what you're willing
to compromise on

20:49.324 --> 20:49.822
and what you aren't.

20:51.142 --> 20:51.574
Tell me about it.

20:53.645 --> 20:54.477
Are you having
trouble with Raj?

20:54.479 --> 20:55.036
Oh, um...

20:56.405 --> 20:57.079
We broke up.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.408
What-- Is--
Is everybody breaking up?

21:01.486 --> 21:02.502
What the heck is happening?

21:02.578 --> 21:04.988
No idea,

21:04.990 --> 21:06.747
but Brandon and Eliza
have some big news.

21:06.825 --> 21:08.099
(knock on door)

21:08.176 --> 21:09.008
-Brandon: Hey, it's me.
-all: Come in.

21:13.181 --> 21:14.922
-What's going on?
-all: Taking a break.

21:15.000 --> 21:15.681
Okay, all right, jeez.

21:17.168 --> 21:20.169
For future reference,
there is a guest house outside.

21:20.171 --> 21:21.095
That's usually where I hide.

21:21.172 --> 21:22.263
Good to know.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.732
So, B, I hear that
you have some big news.

21:32.108 --> 21:35.293
So, do you think
there's any connection

21:35.370 --> 21:38.445
between Carter
transferring to UCLA

21:38.523 --> 21:38.963
and his friendship
with Jude?

21:41.026 --> 21:43.192
I don't know.
Maybe.

21:43.194 --> 21:44.469
Well, didn't you have
any gay friends in college?

21:44.546 --> 21:45.044
(sighs)
What are you getting at?

21:47.532 --> 21:48.297
Do you think Carter...

21:50.368 --> 21:51.959
might be gay?

21:52.037 --> 21:53.135
And would it matter
if he were?

21:54.873 --> 21:55.596
Yes!

21:57.542 --> 21:58.558
Yes, it would.
It would matter a lot.

22:00.636 --> 22:02.987
(sighs)
Well, we don't have time

22:03.064 --> 22:03.604
to talk about this
right now.

22:05.308 --> 22:05.973
Where is everybody?

22:06.051 --> 22:07.108
(scoffs)

22:17.320 --> 22:18.244
I'm going
to see you soon, okay?

22:18.321 --> 22:20.580
<i>  -Okay.</i>
<i> </i> -All right, be good.

22:20.656 --> 22:22.398
I love you.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.841
<i>  I will.</i>
<i>  I love you too.</i>

22:25.753 --> 22:26.419
(call disconnects)

22:26.495 --> 22:27.336
Hey, bud.

22:29.574 --> 22:29.839
What are you doing
over here by yourself?

22:35.580 --> 22:35.853
I just had
to call someone.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.525
Hey. What's going on?

22:46.941 --> 22:48.608
Ah, there you are.

22:48.684 --> 22:50.017
-Oh!
-Oh! I'm sorry.

22:50.095 --> 22:51.094
You okay?

22:51.096 --> 22:52.778
What were you all
doing in there?

22:52.855 --> 22:56.374
-Brandon: They were lost--
-We were washing our hands.

22:56.451 --> 22:58.543
Oh, well,
now that I found you,

22:58.620 --> 22:59.693
my special surprise
is here.

22:59.771 --> 23:02.271
Meet Fleur.

23:02.273 --> 23:03.289
(in Dutch):
<i>  Hallo!</i>

23:03.366 --> 23:05.441
Diane:
Fleur is going
to teach us

23:05.443 --> 23:06.709
a traditional
Dutch folk dance.

23:10.782 --> 23:11.538
(softly):
Where's that guest house?

23:11.616 --> 23:13.783
What did you say?

23:13.785 --> 23:15.618
I--I said it was--

23:15.620 --> 23:17.711
I love being a guest
in your house.

23:17.789 --> 23:19.122
-Callie: Oh, yeah.
-Brandon: Mm-hmm.

23:19.124 --> 23:22.558
(in Dutch accent):
Now, who is
the invalid, please?

23:23.552 --> 23:23.901
Oh, that's Stef.

23:25.888 --> 23:28.397
You? Uh, so you
will play the<i>  bodhran.</i>

23:29.968 --> 23:31.984
(grunts)
You hold like this.

23:32.061 --> 23:34.061
And you play
with the<i>  cipin,</i>

23:34.139 --> 23:34.570
like this.

23:36.141 --> 23:37.073
Mwah. You.

23:38.643 --> 23:40.143
(laughs)

23:40.145 --> 23:41.902
(laughs hesitantly)

23:41.980 --> 23:43.813
I wish I was invalid.

23:43.815 --> 23:44.538
Fleur:
Now, we begin.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.574
On the count of three,

23:47.652 --> 23:49.152
we'll take one step in.

23:49.154 --> 23:50.595
<i>  Een, twee, drie...</i>

23:50.672 --> 23:51.929
And step!

23:52.006 --> 23:53.339
Very good!

23:53.416 --> 23:56.509
And step together.

23:56.585 --> 23:57.994
Step together
and back...

23:57.996 --> 23:59.753
No, no, no, no.

23:59.831 --> 24:01.422
You especially, no.

24:01.499 --> 24:03.775
Step and touch so-so.

24:03.851 --> 24:08.020
Four, five, six, seven,
and grab.

24:08.097 --> 24:10.764
And stomp, stomp,
stomp, stomp. Hey!

24:10.842 --> 24:12.933
(all cheering)

24:13.011 --> 24:14.276
(Dutch folk music playing)

24:22.854 --> 24:23.953
(music continues)

24:33.198 --> 24:35.297
(music continues)

24:42.874 --> 24:44.207
all:
Hey!

24:44.209 --> 24:45.650
Jim:
Very good!

24:45.727 --> 24:46.726
(all cheering)

24:49.881 --> 24:51.972
(indistinct chatter)

24:52.050 --> 24:52.648
Jim:
It was more fun
than I thought.

24:58.056 --> 25:01.057
Hmm. Oh!

25:01.059 --> 25:03.743
-Delicious<i>  boterkoek.</i>
<i> </i> -Thank you.

25:03.819 --> 25:05.911
And, everyone, please
help yourself
to some<i>  bossche bollen.</i>

25:09.234 --> 25:10.166
Hey, uh, Moms...

25:13.071 --> 25:13.903
I think you should
talk to Corey.

25:13.905 --> 25:16.072
-Why?
-What's up?

25:16.074 --> 25:17.298
His little sister
is going into foster care.

25:21.412 --> 25:22.344
Okay. Corey...

25:24.082 --> 25:24.346
Come have
some dessert with us.

25:26.084 --> 25:27.841
So, Fleur,

25:27.919 --> 25:30.086
our lovely daughter Eliza

25:30.088 --> 25:30.770
is going to be
guest first chair

25:30.846 --> 25:34.198
at the Royal Concertgebouw

25:34.275 --> 25:36.517
as an artist exchange
from the LA Phil.

25:36.594 --> 25:38.761
Oh, my!
You must be very talented.

25:38.763 --> 25:39.853
Oh, well, thank you.
She is.

25:39.931 --> 25:40.705
Fleur:
Hmm.

25:42.767 --> 25:44.617
Actually...
that fell through.

25:47.029 --> 25:47.453
What do you mean?

25:49.290 --> 25:51.215
The exchange
isn't happening anymore.

25:51.292 --> 25:52.550
So they had
to rescind the offer.

25:53.961 --> 25:54.210
What?

25:55.446 --> 25:57.171
Is that even legal?
Can they do that?

25:58.449 --> 25:58.890
How should I know?

26:00.876 --> 26:02.968
It's okay. I mean,
honestly, I'm relieved.

26:03.045 --> 26:03.969
Relieved?

26:05.807 --> 26:07.623
When were you planning
on telling us

26:07.625 --> 26:09.458
you weren't going
to Amsterdam?

26:09.460 --> 26:10.643
Actually, we're still going
to Amsterdam.

26:11.796 --> 26:14.063
Brandon got a job
with a composer there.

26:15.891 --> 26:19.744
So I am taking
a year off
from the LA Phil.

26:19.821 --> 26:21.470
A year off?

26:21.472 --> 26:22.321
Honey, what if someone else
takes your spot at the Phil?

26:24.066 --> 26:26.325
All I've done since
I was eight years old
is play the cello.

26:28.146 --> 26:29.754
I need a break.

26:29.831 --> 26:31.647
We're going to explore Europe

26:31.649 --> 26:32.206
and focus on Brandon's career.

26:34.335 --> 26:35.909
And you can
still come visit us.

26:35.987 --> 26:39.488
The whole point
of us going to Europe
was to, you know,

26:39.490 --> 26:40.172
see you play
in the Concertgebouw, so...

26:41.659 --> 26:42.491
That was
the whole point?

26:42.493 --> 26:43.509
What?

26:45.847 --> 26:47.096
So much
for saving our marriage!

26:57.859 --> 26:59.508
Stef:
Think she'll mind
if we burn this?

26:59.510 --> 26:59.900
-(whispers) Will you stop?
-(Step laughs)

27:01.879 --> 27:02.528
I had no idea that...

27:03.939 --> 27:05.272
there were cracks
in her and Jim's marriage.

27:05.350 --> 27:08.017
They always seem to be
on the same tone-deaf page.

27:08.019 --> 27:10.035
All marriages have cracks.

27:11.113 --> 27:11.704
Even ours?

27:13.374 --> 27:14.039
Well, we've had our moments,

27:15.877 --> 27:16.959
but when
the foundation is strong,

27:20.289 --> 27:21.827
you can fill those cracks.

27:21.828 --> 27:23.366
It's a very architectural way
of putting it.

27:23.368 --> 27:25.701
-(Lena laughs)
-So romantic!

27:25.703 --> 27:27.036
Well, I've been working
on my metaphors,

27:27.038 --> 27:27.720
since I'm a politician now.

27:29.632 --> 27:30.873
Very beautiful politician.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.483
Oh, thank you.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.727
You're welcome.

27:34.803 --> 27:35.936
-Hmm, I love you.
-I love you.

27:40.142 --> 27:41.066
Sorry. I--
I should have knocked.

27:43.905 --> 27:46.055
Oh, you look
so much better!

27:46.057 --> 27:46.655
I know!
That's what I'm saying!

27:48.226 --> 27:48.908
Hey, listen,

27:48.984 --> 27:50.893
don't be mad at Jude,

27:50.895 --> 27:52.486
but he told us
about your sister.

27:52.563 --> 27:53.579
-Okay?
-Hey.

27:55.066 --> 27:55.998
Come on,
have a seat.

27:57.159 --> 27:57.750
Tell us
what's going on.

28:02.573 --> 28:03.180
Um...

28:05.410 --> 28:07.426
Her grandma can't
take care of Ka'maya anymore.

28:07.503 --> 28:09.353
-Okay.
-And since
she's not my mom's kid,

28:09.430 --> 28:11.004
they won't let her
live with us.

28:11.082 --> 28:11.931
Hmm.

28:13.434 --> 28:15.935
Okay, but-- but why didn't
you tell us, sweetheart?

28:16.011 --> 28:19.255
Well, I know you're excited
about going to Venezuela.

28:19.257 --> 28:19.813
-Yeah.
-And you're in Sacramento.

28:22.927 --> 28:25.352
I guess I was just afraid
if I told you,

28:25.430 --> 28:25.945
you'd feel like
I was asking you to take her.

28:28.266 --> 28:29.932
You know,
to be her foster moms.

28:29.934 --> 28:32.284
And I didn't want
to put you on the spot
like that.

28:43.464 --> 28:44.380
(knocking)

28:49.804 --> 28:50.561
Hey.

28:53.124 --> 28:54.056
Oh. (sighs)

29:00.222 --> 29:00.896
It's okay.

29:02.633 --> 29:03.407
Me and your mom
are just, uh...

29:06.804 --> 29:07.736
We're just going through
a rough patch.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.030
I've been working...

29:11.809 --> 29:13.250
so much, and she, uh...

29:14.979 --> 29:16.420
She was really
looking forward to that...

29:19.000 --> 29:19.748
You know,
that trip to Europe.

29:20.668 --> 29:21.208
So...

29:23.170 --> 29:24.503
You can still take her
if it makes her happy.

29:27.325 --> 29:28.507
Is going to Europe
a huge sacrifice?

29:31.345 --> 29:33.053
Doesn't always have to be
your way or the highway.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.394
Okay.

29:43.174 --> 29:43.856
Okay, let's, uh...

29:46.844 --> 29:48.027
Let's talk
about UCLA then.

29:49.514 --> 29:50.070
It's fine.

29:51.532 --> 29:52.573
I changed my mind.

29:56.354 --> 29:57.036
Why?

30:05.212 --> 30:05.878
Hey.

30:08.215 --> 30:09.465
Son, what is going on?

30:13.704 --> 30:16.597
Jude, uh...
Jude doesn't want me
to transfer.

30:24.549 --> 30:26.323
What does--
(clears throat)

30:26.400 --> 30:26.899
What does it matter
what Jude wants?

30:32.815 --> 30:33.330
(whispers)
Come on.

30:35.910 --> 30:36.784
Is Jude...

30:41.065 --> 30:41.505
your boyfriend?

30:44.902 --> 30:45.459
I don't know anymore.

30:48.072 --> 30:49.004
Um...

30:53.260 --> 30:54.185
I think
he's breaking up with me.

31:01.085 --> 31:01.642
I'm sorry.

31:05.180 --> 31:06.530
-I love you, son.
-Love you, Dad.

31:08.092 --> 31:09.858
(Carter sobbing)

31:16.951 --> 31:17.950
Jim:
I'm so sorry.

31:20.271 --> 31:21.829
(continues sobbing)

31:32.116 --> 31:34.049
We've already adopted
and fostered four kids.

31:36.712 --> 31:37.561
We've earned the right
to be done with parenting.

31:39.290 --> 31:39.897
She's four years old.

31:41.792 --> 31:43.234
That's 14 more years
until she's 18.

31:46.464 --> 31:48.814
Frankie wouldn't be
much older than Ka'maya is now.

31:50.392 --> 31:51.066
Hmm?

31:54.321 --> 31:55.154
I can't quit
the State Assembly,

31:57.733 --> 31:58.490
which means that
you would have to be home.

32:01.145 --> 32:01.535
And you wouldn't get
your next chapter.

32:02.663 --> 32:03.420
Wouldn't I?

32:05.483 --> 32:06.331
This is a new chapter too.
Don't you think?

32:09.820 --> 32:11.077
The whole point
of going to Venezuela

32:11.155 --> 32:11.837
is because there are children
that need help.

32:13.991 --> 32:16.258
If there's a child here
that needs help,
isn't that also the point?

32:17.085 --> 32:18.010
Hmm?

32:21.849 --> 32:27.352

32:31.266 --> 32:31.940

33:31.902 --> 33:32.626
I'm really sorry
about Jerod.

33:34.830 --> 33:35.420
I know.

33:38.909 --> 33:41.518
It would help if you drop
the trespassing charges.

33:42.747 --> 33:43.345
Of course.

33:47.935 --> 33:48.433
Did you really quit your job?

33:49.678 --> 33:52.020
Yes. And no.

33:54.182 --> 33:56.108
After they took
the Anwei account away,

33:56.184 --> 33:57.109
I was pretty much forced
to negotiate my exit.

34:02.600 --> 34:03.615
I'm sorry.

34:08.864 --> 34:09.663
I never meant to hurt you.

34:10.775 --> 34:11.456
Personally.

34:14.461 --> 34:15.669
Just professionally?

34:19.633 --> 34:22.009
What did you think
was going to happen to
our relationship after that?

34:25.213 --> 34:27.222
I thought
you would be mad,

34:29.143 --> 34:30.559
but we'd be able
to work through it.

34:32.313 --> 34:33.219
And that's why
you were waiting for me

34:33.297 --> 34:33.520
with your bags packed?

34:36.558 --> 34:37.408
I think you knew
what you were doing

34:37.484 --> 34:38.817
would end
our relationship,

34:38.894 --> 34:39.243
but you did it anyway.

34:40.971 --> 34:41.236
You made a choice.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.415
You were lying
to the tenants.

34:44.491 --> 34:45.082
I was representing
my client.

34:47.069 --> 34:48.368
Call it what you want.
It doesn't make it okay.

34:51.665 --> 34:53.757
You know, you once said that

34:53.834 --> 34:54.833
we shared the same values
where it counted.

34:56.654 --> 34:56.785
And that counted.

34:57.988 --> 34:59.880
And the tenants
knowing the truth counted.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.216
So, yeah, yeah,
I made a choice.

35:05.496 --> 35:07.438
I need someone
who will choose me, Callie.

35:07.514 --> 35:10.223
Choosing you shouldn't mean
compromising my morals.

35:11.259 --> 35:11.892
That's not love.

35:14.338 --> 35:15.762
Truth is you always felt

35:15.840 --> 35:16.897
like you were
compromising yourself
to be with me.

35:18.509 --> 35:19.733
And you're right,
that's not love.

35:24.940 --> 35:26.073
I'm sorry.
This was a mistake.

35:28.185 --> 35:28.533
It should
never have happened.

35:43.701 --> 35:45.425
Hey. You okay?

35:47.163 --> 35:48.553
I just came out
to my dad.

35:50.541 --> 35:52.099
Wow! That's...

35:53.544 --> 35:54.985
Should I hide?

35:55.062 --> 35:55.977
Depends.

35:57.381 --> 35:58.230
Are you still my boyfriend?

36:00.308 --> 36:00.982
Why wouldn't I be?

36:03.554 --> 36:04.903
I saw you and Connor
kissing.

36:10.060 --> 36:11.727
Uh... I'm sorry.

36:11.729 --> 36:13.578
I-- I don't...
know why I did that.

36:13.655 --> 36:14.338
It's okay.

36:17.084 --> 36:18.834
I've thought about you
so many times.

36:20.738 --> 36:21.294
But...

36:22.831 --> 36:23.338
I'm with Carter.

36:26.668 --> 36:28.635
You'll always
be my first love.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.690
Same.

36:33.767 --> 36:35.809
And I do hope that
we can still be friends.

36:37.755 --> 36:38.195
Me too.

36:41.258 --> 36:42.758
That was like...

36:42.760 --> 36:44.034
the goodbye kiss
that we never had.

36:46.521 --> 36:47.704
I don't want to hook up
with anyone else.

36:49.433 --> 36:50.782
I want us to be exclusive.

36:53.787 --> 36:54.536
If you want to.

36:56.774 --> 36:57.372
I do.

37:02.279 --> 37:04.212
So why don't you want me
to transfer to UCLA?

37:08.786 --> 37:10.218
My first year at college
was awful.

37:13.140 --> 37:15.566
But then
I got my shit together,

37:15.642 --> 37:16.641
I started making
real friends,

37:18.887 --> 37:19.853
and I, like,
finally found myself.

37:21.315 --> 37:25.133
I just... I want to have
my own college experience.

37:25.135 --> 37:26.410
And I think
that we both should.

37:29.306 --> 37:29.913
Can you understand that?

37:32.567 --> 37:33.250
Yeah.

37:37.739 --> 37:38.997
NYU has
a great film department.

37:41.335 --> 37:42.209
I think I'll apply there.

37:53.755 --> 37:55.430
Hey. I have some people
I want you to meet.

37:57.759 --> 37:59.835
-Hi, Ka'maya.
-Hi there.

37:59.837 --> 38:01.111
This is Stef and Lena.

38:01.188 --> 38:02.262
I used
to live with them

38:02.339 --> 38:04.339
when my mom couldn't
take care of me.

38:04.341 --> 38:06.283
<i>  Hi. I hurted my finger.</i>

38:06.360 --> 38:09.444
Oh! Honey, I'm so sorry
that happened.

38:10.514 --> 38:12.623
But, you know,
I got to tell you,

38:12.699 --> 38:14.107
my favorite color
is purple.

38:14.184 --> 38:14.533
Just like
on your bandage there.

38:14.609 --> 38:16.243
<i>  Me too!</i>

38:18.689 --> 38:21.114
I love your pigtails.

38:21.191 --> 38:22.707
<i>  Thank you.</i>
<i>  I like your hair too.</i>

38:22.784 --> 38:24.376
<i>  It's really big.</i>

38:26.864 --> 38:28.547
You have no idea,
honey.

38:28.623 --> 38:29.965
It gets bigger
every day too.

38:32.536 --> 38:33.143
She's so cute.

38:44.565 --> 38:46.156
Brandon:
Well, thank you so much
for this party.

38:46.233 --> 38:47.382
I hope
we didn't ruin it.

38:47.384 --> 38:50.886
We will see you soon
in Amsterdam.

38:50.888 --> 38:52.320
-So we're going?
-Of course, we are.

38:54.649 --> 38:55.999
-That makes me so happy.
-Aw, me too.

38:57.319 --> 38:58.651
-Jim: Safe travels.
-Thank you very much.

38:58.729 --> 39:00.170
-Diane: Congrats on the job.
-Eliza: Love you, Dad.

39:03.734 --> 39:05.417
(indistinct chatter)

39:05.493 --> 39:07.627
-Brandon: Bye, Moms.
-Stef: Bye. Take care, honey.

39:10.407 --> 39:11.740
Brandon:
Take care.

39:11.742 --> 39:13.341
-Lena: Take lots of pictures.
-Brandon: I will.

39:15.079 --> 39:17.804
(indistinct chatter)

39:21.752 --> 39:24.010
So, I... was going
to send you off

39:24.088 --> 39:25.420
with the flan,

39:25.422 --> 39:27.364
but apparently
Fleur took it.

39:27.441 --> 39:28.273
I knew that woman
had sticky fingers.

39:28.350 --> 39:30.092
(Jim laughs)

39:30.094 --> 39:31.359
And, uh...

39:32.429 --> 39:34.154
I apologize
for my outburst earlier.

39:35.857 --> 39:36.865
Not at all.
We're family.

39:39.861 --> 39:41.161
-Well, thanks.
-Jim: Well, in that case...

39:44.274 --> 39:44.881
And you too, Stef.

39:48.536 --> 39:50.203
"We're family"?

39:50.280 --> 39:50.837
Well, like it or not.

39:52.282 --> 39:55.717
So, San Diego's
a whole lot closer
than Caracas.

39:56.970 --> 39:59.788
Can't wait
to meet Ka'maya.

39:59.790 --> 40:00.731
I knew that nest
wouldn't stay empty for long.

40:03.218 --> 40:05.127
So, did you
get your answer tonight?

40:05.129 --> 40:05.518
About Jamie?

40:07.222 --> 40:08.063
Uh, yes.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.150
I made the only choice
I could.

40:12.227 --> 40:13.026
Well, we're proud
of you for...

40:14.337 --> 40:15.820
being true to yourself.

40:15.897 --> 40:17.472
Lena:
We're proud
of both of you guys.

40:17.474 --> 40:18.740
For taking such
strong stands in your lives.

40:20.827 --> 40:21.618
Okay, I'm--
I'm dating my ex-boss.

40:23.147 --> 40:25.255
That's why I didn't tell you
about the white supremacists.

40:25.332 --> 40:27.832
I didn't want you to judge him
for not shutting down the app.

40:27.909 --> 40:27.924
Or judge me.

40:29.820 --> 40:31.920
I'm not like Callie.
I can't ignore my feelings
for my principles.

40:33.323 --> 40:36.082
Evan's doing
the best that he can,
and honestly,

40:36.160 --> 40:37.258
I'm okay with that.

40:38.829 --> 40:39.386
Okay.

40:41.832 --> 40:43.589
You're being true
to yourself.

40:43.667 --> 40:45.591
-That's all we can ask.
-Really?

40:45.669 --> 40:46.893
Of course, sweetheart.

40:50.023 --> 40:50.781
Were you really
that scared?

40:50.857 --> 40:51.731
No!

40:53.768 --> 40:54.275
-See you later.
-Yeah, see you too.

40:56.013 --> 40:58.180
-Bye, honey.
-Bye.

40:58.182 --> 40:59.439
Corey:
Y'all stay safe.

40:59.516 --> 41:02.517
