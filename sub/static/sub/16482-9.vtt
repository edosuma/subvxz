00:02.203 --> 00:03.268
<i>Previously on</i> This Is Us...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.636
I told you that when I met you,

00:04.638 --> 00:06.505
that I couldn't fall
for a fat person.

00:06.507 --> 00:07.806
But you did.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.476
So now what?

00:10.478 --> 00:12.478
You're just gonna throw me away?

00:12.480 --> 00:14.346
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

00:15.783 --> 00:16.949
Can't do what?

00:16.951 --> 00:18.617
When a nice boy who adores you

00:18.619 --> 00:19.885
offers you pie,

00:19.887 --> 00:21.553
<i>say thank you.</i>

00:21.555 --> 00:23.622
RANDALL:
<i>Why is there a photo of me</i>

00:23.624 --> 00:27.226
<i>in a letter that you sent
to William's apartment?</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:29.128
Randall, you have
to understand...

00:29.130 --> 00:31.964
Understand what,
that you knew my father?

00:31.966 --> 00:36.035
That you kept him from me
my entire life?

00:43.210 --> 00:46.545
(voices whispering)

00:49.050 --> 00:52.251
I'm upset, I'm not deaf.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.822
Hey, babe.
- Hey.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.757
I was worried about you.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.159
I'm fine.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.595
The carpet would beg to differ.
- Mm.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.998
You've been pacing
for a few hours now.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.168
You ready to talk?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.769
To William.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.404
You can come in, too, William.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.176
I know how angry you must be.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.610
When did you meet my mother?

01:18.612 --> 01:22.181
When she took you home
from the hospital.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.852
I wanted to make sure you were
going to a good home.

01:26.854 --> 01:29.421
RANDALL:
Hmm.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.825
Did my father know about you?

01:34.295 --> 01:36.095
I never got that impression.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.732
What are you writing, babe?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.935
A list of reasons
I'm mad at my mother.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.970
I got 22 so far.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.538
And don't think I'm ignoring

01:46.540 --> 01:48.073
the fact that
you lied to me, too.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.875
When I showed up
at your door two months ago,

01:49.877 --> 01:52.478
you acted like you didn't
remember abandoning me.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.379
I was respecting
your mother's wishes.

01:54.381 --> 01:57.883
Which is why
I'm second maddest at you.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.318
You're in third place.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.320
But... I've been trying
to get your mother

02:01.322 --> 02:03.388
to tell you the truth
since I found out.

02:03.390 --> 02:06.558
Which is why there isn't
a Beth or William list.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.560
My mother's the one
who betrayed me.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.330
And as soon as I'm
finished with this list,

02:11.332 --> 02:12.965
I'm gonna read it to her,

02:12.967 --> 02:16.201
and make sure she hears
every damn word.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.972
(music playing over P.A. system)

02:19.974 --> 02:21.473
I'm gonna beat you!

02:21.475 --> 02:24.409
Whoa! Slow do...
Slow down.

02:24.411 --> 02:25.844
The deli guy can't believe
we've already gone through

02:25.846 --> 02:27.246
the two pounds of ham
and cheese from last week.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.614
Triplets.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.816
Speaking of, you know
where our third is?

02:30.818 --> 02:31.984
RANDALL:
Let me show you again.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.253
Like that.
Can you do that?

02:37.158 --> 02:38.490
Sorry.
He's with us.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.925
Sorry.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.326
Sorry about that.

02:41.328 --> 02:42.828
What are you doing?
What was that, huh?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.696
I asked 'em if they
could roll their tongues.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.265
But, sweetheart,
that's not really

02:46.267 --> 02:47.599
something you ask strangers.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.602
We learned about
inherited traits in science,

02:50.604 --> 02:52.271
and rolling your tongue is one.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.107
If I can find people
who roll their tongue,

02:55.109 --> 02:57.342
they could be my birth parents.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.948
RANDALL:
Excuse me...

03:02.950 --> 03:04.583
Oh...

03:05.853 --> 03:07.786
Look, I... I don't know
what to tell him.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.621
I mean, he knows
everything that we do.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.524
Then there's
nothing else to say.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.627
I just...
I don't want him

03:15.629 --> 03:17.462
sticking his tongue out
at strangers,

03:17.464 --> 03:20.832
you know, when he's 80.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.969
It kills me that
he'll always have this hole,

03:23.971 --> 03:25.470
not knowing who his parents are.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.306
We're his parents.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.608
You know what I mean.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.579
(dishes clattering)

03:34.882 --> 03:37.983
Hey, Bec. Hey,
sponge down, sponge down.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.819
Look at me a sec.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.554
Look...
- (sighs)

03:42.556 --> 03:45.023
I know this is hard
to think about.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.025
It's hard for me, too.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.660
Okay? But he has
questions that...

03:48.662 --> 03:50.329
they're not gonna go away.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.997
I just, I don't want him
resenting us...

03:51.999 --> 03:53.498
For what, Jack?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.435
We love him, we give him
absolutely everything

03:56.437 --> 03:58.337
he could ever want, what...

03:58.339 --> 04:01.006
would he be missing from us?

04:01.008 --> 04:03.909
We can't roll our tongues.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.249
I can.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.452
You can roll your tongue?
I can roll my tongue.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.921
Roll your tongue.
Just...

04:20.861 --> 04:22.194
(laughing):
Babe...

04:22.196 --> 04:23.762
Am I doing it?
- It's so sad.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.530
I'm not doing it?
- You're not rolling your tongue.

04:25.532 --> 04:28.700
But I can show you. Yeah.
- You can show me?

04:31.972 --> 04:35.641
Mom never told him that
she knew his biological dad?

04:35.643 --> 04:36.708
I know.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.310
That's cuckoo's nest-level
insane.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.945
Well, what about you?

04:39.947 --> 04:41.747
Showing up all of a sudden,
deciding to get

04:41.749 --> 04:43.382
your stomach cut open...
What is that?

04:43.384 --> 04:46.218
Uh, I almost died
in a plane crash, Kevin.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.820
Okay? My life flashed
before my eyes.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.455
Kate, you experienced
mild turbulence.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.923
All right?
You spilled your peanuts.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.226
It was scary.
Shut up.

04:54.228 --> 04:59.064
It was a real "seize the day"
kind of awakening for me.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.566
Yeah? Okay, well,
what happened to dieting?

05:01.568 --> 05:05.404
I don't know, I ran the numbers,
and... (scoffs)

05:05.406 --> 05:07.272
at this rate,
I would be 106 years old

05:07.274 --> 05:09.741
by the time I reach
my goal weight.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.411
So I, you know, I want to live now.
- Yeah?

05:12.413 --> 05:14.112
Yeah.
- Does this have anything to do

05:14.114 --> 05:15.414
with your breakup with Toby?

05:15.416 --> 05:17.182
No. I'm fine.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.750
You know, millions of people

05:18.752 --> 05:20.585
have surgery every day...
It's not a big deal.

05:20.587 --> 05:22.487
It's not a big deal?
No, it's one of about

05:22.489 --> 05:24.623
a billion big deals swirling
around in my head right now.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.158
Kate, I've got you,
I've got Randall,

05:26.160 --> 05:27.426
Mom's selling the cabin,

05:27.428 --> 05:28.360
I just had the
single greatest kiss

05:28.362 --> 05:30.329
of my entire life...
- Whoa.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.764
Mom's selling the cabin?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.166
Yeah, I found out yesterday.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.134
It sucks, right?
She can't do...

05:36.136 --> 05:39.671
I love the cabin.
The cabin is our childhood.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.107
I know, but we haven't
been there in years, right?

05:42.109 --> 05:44.776
Well, let's go. We should.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.545
Like, let's seize the day.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.227
Hey, have you guys seen...
Oh, there it is.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.317
Ran out of paper.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.851
You know where I bet
there is a ton of paper?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.754
Where?

05:59.293 --> 06:01.626
(Randall sighs)

06:01.628 --> 06:04.963
Can't believe Mom
is selling this place.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.399
I got a lot of
"can't believes" with Mom.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.700
You know what I can't believe?

06:08.702 --> 06:09.968
That we are in the middle
of nowhere,

06:09.970 --> 06:11.136
and all my messages are
going through.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.838
Do I have wifi in my car?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.639
No.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.174
No wifi.
I'm living in the past.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.809
I'm not.
Not anymore.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.644
Listen, man,
I know you're hurting,

06:19.646 --> 06:21.646
but you and Mom are gonna have
to make up eventually, okay?

06:21.648 --> 06:23.849
Hopefully before Christmas,
so that holiday isn't ruined.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.917
Nope. I'm gonna
clear out my stuff,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.987
hand over my keys, then I am
out of the whole thing.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.823
Ha! That's funny.
(cell phone chimes)

06:31.825 --> 06:33.992
With the language barrier,
sometimes Olivia's funnier

06:33.994 --> 06:36.495
than she means to be.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.398
She's British. She speaks <i> English.</i>
- Yes.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.540
RANDALL: Never understood
why Mom felt like we needed

06:48.542 --> 06:50.542
three locks on this door.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.377
It's because Kev was
afraid of bears.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.281
Hey,<i> Zoobooks</i> said
they're smart.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.049
RANDALL:
Not this smart.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.684
Forgive me for not learning
in high school.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.520
I was having sex, Randall.

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:17.704 --> 07:19.171
Uh...

07:21.308 --> 07:24.543
Ah, so much denim
on denim. Look.

07:24.545 --> 07:27.446
I can't look now, I'm busy.

07:27.448 --> 07:29.781
Oh, you still can't see
the Magic Eye?

07:29.783 --> 07:31.883
Uh... yeah.
- Look, you just gotta relax your eyes.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.319
Yeah.
- Look through it, and it's right...

07:34.321 --> 07:35.587
Right there in front
of you, I know.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.055
That's what Dad always
used to say,

07:37.057 --> 07:38.657
but I can't see it...
It's a pirate ship!

07:38.659 --> 07:39.991
It's always been a bear, dude.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.126
But you know what?

07:41.128 --> 07:43.395
Maybe it was never real, anyway.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.896
Just like the rest
of my childhood.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.567
Randall...
What Mom did was insane,

07:48.569 --> 07:50.469
but that doesn't erase
your childhood.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.838
Me and Kev are real.
(Kevin chuckles)

07:52.840 --> 07:55.307
Okay? Our family...
we're <i> real.</i>

07:55.309 --> 07:57.275
Yeah.
- Come here.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.643
No, come look at this.
All right.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.746
Come on, indulge us.
Sit down.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.915
Look at this.
Look.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.084
We're all here.
<i>You're</i> here.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.320
Grinning ear to ear
in our elastic waistband,

08:08.322 --> 08:09.621
acid-washed jeans.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.656
Those jeans were <i> real!</i>

08:11.658 --> 08:13.592
All right, here.
Let me see.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.927
Look at this. Right there?
KATE: Mm-hmm.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.096
That's Mom lying to me about
not being able

08:18.098 --> 08:19.798
to find my birth father.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.934
Okay.
That's awesome.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.770
You're right.
I-I'm sorry.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.672
But this is probably
gonna be the last time

08:27.674 --> 08:30.308
that the three of us
are ever gonna be here.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.143
So can we just enjoy today?

08:32.145 --> 08:34.880
Please?

08:34.881 --> 08:36.481
(car pulling up)

08:36.482 --> 08:39.518
What's that?
I'll get it.

08:41.288 --> 08:42.953
Hey.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.025
KEVIN:
Hey...

08:47.027 --> 08:48.226
you made it!

08:51.131 --> 08:53.665
You all made it.
Oh. Huh.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.700
Are you kidding me?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.936
What do you think?
- Yeah.

09:01.375 --> 09:03.141
It's not a bear.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.510
Oh. Good to know.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.480
This place is so quaint.

09:08.482 --> 09:09.981
KEVIN:
Yeah, right?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.984
Oh, my God.
(chuckles)

09:12.986 --> 09:15.053
This looks absurd.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.428
Hey, what's up?

09:23.430 --> 09:25.063
This was supposed to be our day.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.732
What? No, I mean, you know,
I told her that we were here.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.000
I told her she could come.
I didn't know she was gonna

09:29.002 --> 09:30.902
bring our playwright
and some dude.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.671
This guy is wearing
suspenders over a thermal.

09:32.673 --> 09:33.905
Like, what...
what is that?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.574
These are my people now, Kate.

09:35.576 --> 09:38.510
He's an artist.
He's authentic.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.345
(scoffs)
I'm sorry, I love you,

09:40.347 --> 09:41.513
but I want to punch you.

09:41.515 --> 09:42.714
Okay, can you do me a favor?

09:42.716 --> 09:44.349
Can you please just
give them a chance?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.384
I really want you to like Olivia.
- ASHER: Hey, hey.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.802
We brought some nosh
and some liquid.

09:47.803 --> 09:49.219
Cool if I just put it
here in the fridge?

09:49.222 --> 09:50.689
KEVIN: Yeah, just,
you know, throw it in there.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.790
Right on.
It's for everyone.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.024
(whispering):
That is weird.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.526
(whispering):
It's nice.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.528
Man.
Rad cabin, by the way.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.064
Whew, Norman Rockwell?

09:59.066 --> 10:01.232
He would have really
lost his mind in this place.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.268
Thanks.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.870
Yeah, that's nice of you.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.208
I can't tear 'em away
from that Atari.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.610
Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.244
I'll give my boys another five.

10:13.246 --> 10:17.782
I'm feeling generous today.
(chuckles) Okay.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.285
Hey, so has Randall asked you

10:20.287 --> 10:22.887
if you can roll your tongue?

10:22.889 --> 10:25.056
No. He supposed to?

10:25.058 --> 10:26.992
(Jack sighs)
He's been asking people,

10:26.994 --> 10:29.394
hoping to trace that trait
across the whole city

10:29.396 --> 10:31.930
to see if he can find his birth parents.
And we told him

10:31.932 --> 10:34.399
we can't find
his biological parents,

10:34.401 --> 10:35.600
and he understands that, so...

10:35.602 --> 10:37.569
YVETTE:
Oh, okay.

10:37.571 --> 10:40.472
At least, now, I get it.

10:40.474 --> 10:43.008
He's been telling my boys
different stories

10:43.010 --> 10:45.310
about who his father might be.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.178
He has? Hmm. Like what?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.180
Oh, he makes up
different things.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.583
Sometimes a cook.
Basketball player.

10:51.585 --> 10:53.251
Once he was the mailman.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.819
And it's...

10:54.821 --> 10:57.088
just stories about his father?
YVETTE: Oh,

10:57.090 --> 10:59.190
just stop it, Jack.
Okay? Think about it.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.026
Cook. Basketball player.

11:01.028 --> 11:03.128
Your mailman. Is he white?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.363
No.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.865
No. He's black.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.968
It sounds like
he may be picking jobs

11:09.970 --> 11:11.836
that he's seen black men do.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.938
Like he's looking for someone

11:13.940 --> 11:16.508
he sees himself in.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.777
(inhales)

11:18.779 --> 11:20.812
I think he may need

11:20.814 --> 11:22.814
black male role models.

11:22.816 --> 11:25.050
Men who can show him

11:25.052 --> 11:27.852
who he might grow into.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.723
(birds chirping)

11:31.725 --> 11:33.391
"The man you will marry
will be wearing

11:33.393 --> 11:35.960
a mask when you first meet."
(chuckles)

11:35.962 --> 11:37.962
If only Gertrude Stein
had one of these

11:37.964 --> 11:41.232
in her Paris salon.
Yeah. I know, totally.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.135
Cliché, right? I always hated
playing this game. KATE: Uh...

11:44.137 --> 11:46.404
What? You liked it more than I did.
I did not like it more than you.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.206
Don't say that. I didn't.
- You sh...

11:48.208 --> 11:50.241
Randall, come take a break. Come spin.
- Hmm?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.342
Wait. Shh.

11:51.344 --> 11:53.344
You hear that?

11:53.346 --> 11:54.979
It sounds like...

11:54.981 --> 11:56.681
clicking.
What is that?

11:56.683 --> 11:59.250
(panting)

11:59.252 --> 12:01.386
KEVIN:
I don't hear anything.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.488
(door opens)
Randall?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.156
Okay. Uh...

12:05.158 --> 12:07.225
He was never any fun
to play with anyway., so...

12:07.227 --> 12:09.160
Anybody need anything from the kitchen?
KEVIN: I'm good.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.729
I think it's your turn.
Spin for me,

12:10.731 --> 12:12.997
Sandberg.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.502
"Who was the best kiss
you ever had?"

12:17.504 --> 12:19.471
Easy. Liv.

12:20.707 --> 12:23.708
S... So, is that Liv,
like Olivia?

12:23.710 --> 12:26.511
I leave an impression
on people I date.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.446
Oh.

12:28.448 --> 12:29.748
Wow.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.250
O-Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.352
Okay. All right.
It's your turn.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.755
(laughing):
No, no, no. Hold on.

12:36.757 --> 12:39.891
You brought your ex
to our family cabin?

12:39.893 --> 12:41.559
Look, Kate, it's fine. I mean,

12:41.561 --> 12:44.028
everyone's got exes, right?
It's... It's okay.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.131
Uh... Who are you right now?

12:46.133 --> 12:48.566
ASHER: Hey, anybody know what happened
to my smoothie? (mouths): It's fine.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.034
It was supposed to last all day.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.703
Had these super
top-shelf mushrooms in it,

12:51.705 --> 12:53.271
really gonna open up my world.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.774
(sing-songy):
Half of it's gone.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.475
Who drank it?

12:58.645 --> 13:01.513
(power tool whirring)

13:13.727 --> 13:16.561
Hey, son.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.297
Hey, Dad.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.069
* *

13:33.580 --> 13:35.079
* *

13:35.081 --> 13:38.082
KATE (distorted):
Randall.

13:38.084 --> 13:41.519
Randall, are you okay?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.421
Randall.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.990
Randall. Are you okay?
KEVIN: Of course he's not.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.326
He just accidentally drank mushrooms.
ASHER: This stuff

13:48.328 --> 13:50.695
is totally safe, don't even
worry about him. He's having

13:50.697 --> 13:52.764
a <i> way</i> better time than the rest of us.
KATE: Okay,

13:52.766 --> 13:53.998
(distorted):
you got our brother high,

13:54.000 --> 13:55.500
you don't get an opinion.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.701
Hey, Randall, buddy?

13:56.703 --> 13:57.869
You want to, uh...

13:57.871 --> 14:00.104
want to come inside with us?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.941
No,

14:02.943 --> 14:04.542
Dad, I don't want to go in.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.144
Hmm.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.012
Okay.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.782
(distorted): Yeah, Kate,
we have his car keys, right?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.183
Yeah. They're in the kitchen.
Okay.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.620
Um, tell you what.
We're gonna, um...

14:15.622 --> 14:18.022
(phone camera clicks)
we're gonna head inside.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.924
We'll check on you
in a little bit, all right?

14:20.894 --> 14:22.360
(distorted):
Okay.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.463
He's fine.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.533
Is he?
- Yeah, yeah. He's... he's good.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.541
JACK: You know,
If you kids weren't always

14:36.543 --> 14:40.278
throwing stuff up here, maybe
this gutter wouldn't be broken.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.315
We need to talk about Mom.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.483
Yeah?

14:45.485 --> 14:47.185
Ever since I was a baby,

14:47.187 --> 14:49.254
she knew who
my biological father was.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.588
What?

14:50.590 --> 14:52.490
No, kiddo, that's crazy.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.658
Yeah, Dad. It is crazy.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.026
It's also true.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.829
You know...

14:57.831 --> 15:01.366
your mom and I, we went through

15:01.368 --> 15:03.101
a lot for you.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.937
For her to keep
a secret like that?

15:05.939 --> 15:07.171
That would destroy her.

15:07.173 --> 15:09.674
Dad, I tracked him down.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.377
William.

15:12.379 --> 15:13.912
He's my biological father.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.247
And Mom admitted it.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.516
* *

15:18.518 --> 15:19.918
(three distinct clicks)

15:22.022 --> 15:24.355
(three distinct clicks)

15:24.357 --> 15:25.590
Dad?

15:27.360 --> 15:31.195
STUDENTS:
Kiyah! Kiyah! Kiyah! Kiyah!

15:31.197 --> 15:32.430
Kiyah!

15:32.432 --> 15:34.365
Good job, Lau.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.701
Nice class. Get your
parents, get your shoes.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.536
Isaiah, come here.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.871
How's everything?

15:39.873 --> 15:41.039
Everything work out for you?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.307
All right. Good job.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.642
Good class, son.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.246
(exhales)
Hey, uh...

15:48.248 --> 15:50.381
Can I help you with something?
Yeah. I-I'm looking for Ray?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.050
Oh, yeah. That's me.
Hey, Ray. I'm Jack.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.618
My friend Yvette

15:53.620 --> 15:55.320
told me I should come by.
Oh, yeah.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.487
She said she may be
sending someone by.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.755
You wanted to sign your son up

15:57.757 --> 16:00.558
for classes, she said.
Yeah. This is my son, Randall.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.626
- RAY: Hey.
- Hi.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.995
Hey, my man, nice to meet you.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.930
You ever studied
any martial arts before?

16:05.932 --> 16:07.398
Nope.
- Ah...

16:07.400 --> 16:09.734
Maybe you want to be
the next Ron Van Clief.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.402
Who's that?
- (chuckles)

16:11.404 --> 16:14.138
Take your shoes off.
I'll show you.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.842
Yeah. Go on.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.811
* *

16:19.813 --> 16:21.579
Right this way.

16:21.581 --> 16:25.116
RAY:
Four-time World Karate champion.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.752
Bruce Lee used to call
this guy the "Black Dragon."

16:27.754 --> 16:31.756
Yeah, man. That's a lot of
hard work that goes into that.

16:31.758 --> 16:35.193
RAY (in distance): You're gonna learn
karate. RANDALL: I like learning.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.664
Hey. You know Ian at work?

16:39.666 --> 16:42.834
The one with the David Bowie eyes?
- (chuckles) Yeah. Yeah.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.168
Yeah, him.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.636
So, a few months back,

16:45.638 --> 16:48.506
he thought his wife
might be cheating on him,

16:48.508 --> 16:51.442
so he hired one of those P.I.s
to follow her around.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.811
I don't know.
I was thinking, maybe...

16:53.813 --> 16:55.446
maybe we can do the same.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.648
See if we can find
Randall's parents.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.150
Jack. We talked
about this.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.486
I know. I know. Look,
just... hear me out.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.855
(opens closet)
We hire a guy.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.723
Okay? He checks hospital
records. Sees...

17:05.724 --> 17:08.626
sees what babies were born
that day. Talks to the families.

17:08.627 --> 17:12.563
You know? Maybe he finds the
people that gave him up and...

17:12.565 --> 17:16.034
And then what? And then
what are you hoping happens?

17:17.704 --> 17:21.039
I'm hoping he gets
a better understanding

17:21.040 --> 17:23.241
of who he is.
(closes door)

17:23.242 --> 17:24.809
I thought that's why
you were taking him

17:24.810 --> 17:27.512
to the dojo place Yvette
recommended. Look,

17:27.513 --> 17:29.680
I could take him there
for an hour every week,

17:29.682 --> 17:32.984
and he can see these black men
that he can look up to.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.019
But those boys?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.989
They get to go home
with those men.

17:37.991 --> 17:39.590
They get to grow up with this

17:39.592 --> 17:42.093
inherent understanding
of who they are.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.328
Well, he is Randall Pearson.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.830
That's who he is.
- Yes.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.332
He is our son.

17:48.334 --> 17:52.203
He is our all-star, knockout boy

17:52.205 --> 17:54.172
who deserves everything
that we could

17:54.174 --> 17:56.407
possibly give him,
even if that means

17:56.409 --> 17:57.842
sucking up our own feelings

17:57.844 --> 18:00.445
about him having birth parents
out there somewhere

18:00.447 --> 18:02.513
that might fill this void
that he's that feeling.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.849
And what if they're
drug addicts?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.018
Or criminals? We're gonna
let them meet our son?

18:07.020 --> 18:09.520
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.790
Hey, why are you
against even trying?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.792
Huh?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.764
* *

18:30.076 --> 18:32.610
Hi.

18:32.612 --> 18:33.778
Can I help you?

18:33.780 --> 18:35.379
I'm...

18:35.381 --> 18:37.048
Rebecca...
- Oh, oh...

18:37.050 --> 18:38.883
Wow. Uh...
I wasn't expecting

18:38.885 --> 18:40.885
to ever see you again.

18:40.887 --> 18:44.388
I didn't know if you
still lived here.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.090
Uh, rent control.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.459
Would you like to come in?

18:48.461 --> 18:50.661
(siren wails in distance)

18:59.739 --> 19:02.240
Hi.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.408
I know women like you.

19:04.410 --> 19:07.245
Pretentious pretty girls
who use guys like Kev

19:07.247 --> 19:08.679
to, you know, feel interesting,

19:08.681 --> 19:10.915
because they're dating
someone "uncomplicated."

19:10.917 --> 19:12.917
He's not uncomplicated.

19:12.919 --> 19:15.186
But it is fascinating
how you all make him

19:15.188 --> 19:16.988
play that role
within the family.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.457
(scoffs) Don't talk about him or
my family like you know anything

19:19.459 --> 19:21.692
about us.
I know you're holding him back.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.596
My brother is earnest,
and he's sweet.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.665
And you will not take
that away from him.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.669
Okay, Kate.
Kate, I understand, okay?

19:31.671 --> 19:32.870
You're jealous.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.640
(laughs)

19:35.642 --> 19:36.974
Of you?

19:36.976 --> 19:39.677
God, get over yourself.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.345
You are the last person
in the world

19:41.347 --> 19:43.047
that I would want
to <i> Freaky Friday</i> with.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.116
Of him.
He's changing.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.785
And that's scary for you because
you want to change too.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.520
I'm sorry.
Do I look scared to you?

19:49.522 --> 19:51.522
You're scared that you'll
lose all the weight,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.491
and that nothing
will have changed, right?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.359
That you will discover
that the person

19:55.361 --> 19:57.862
who you've always been
is who you truly are.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.631
And all your dreams of the kind
of life you're gonna lead

20:00.633 --> 20:04.735
one day are nothing more
than lies you've told yourself.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.971
I get it.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.506
It's scary.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.641
I mean, if I were you,
I'd be terrified.

20:12.078 --> 20:13.544
Trust me.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.214
You don't know women like me.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.658
Hey.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.328
Look at Randall. You think he's
okay out there? I mean, maybe

20:30.330 --> 20:33.264
we should go get him or something.
I don't know. Why don't you ask

20:33.266 --> 20:36.500
your spiritual guru,
Miss Hardcore Bitch?

20:36.502 --> 20:38.936
What?
- Yeah.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.072
She just told me that,
if I have the surgery,

20:41.074 --> 20:42.373
it might not change anything.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.208
Like it's any of her
freaking business.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.043
Well...

20:46.045 --> 20:47.678
"Well" what?

20:48.881 --> 20:50.848
Maybe she has a point.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.017
Oh, my God, are you taking her side?
- No. No,

20:53.019 --> 20:54.785
I'm not taking her side,
I'm just saying, you know,

20:54.787 --> 20:57.221
I've been saying all along
this surgery is just dangerous.

20:57.223 --> 21:00.191
Who... (scoffs)
Who are you?

21:00.193 --> 21:02.026
Who is this guy trying so hard

21:02.028 --> 21:04.528
to be real that you can't see
how fake these people are?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.464
At least they're being honest,
okay?

21:06.466 --> 21:07.798
You want to stand there
and pretend

21:07.800 --> 21:09.567
like you're not scared
of this surgery

21:09.569 --> 21:12.637
or that you're A-OK with
this breakup with Toby, then...

21:12.639 --> 21:13.871
keep on acting.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.740
Yeah, well, you too.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.408
'Cause you're doing a super job

21:17.410 --> 21:19.377
in your new role
in <i> Full Metal Jackass.</i>

21:21.881 --> 21:23.281
Hey.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.852
Hey. You can't just disappear
when we're talking.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.821
You know, we gave
you everything.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.724
The most loving family.

21:33.726 --> 21:35.793
Private school.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.262
We made sure you had
black influences

21:38.264 --> 21:40.765
to help you understand
your background.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.800
We gave you everything we could.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.503
And all I was supposed to feel
was grateful.

21:45.505 --> 21:47.305
I was supposed to just shut up
and be thankful

21:47.307 --> 21:48.806
that I had these great parents

21:48.808 --> 21:50.574
who wanted me
when my birth parents didn't.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.678
But the truth is
you never wanted me, either.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.912
What are you talking about?

21:54.914 --> 21:57.648
I was a replacement
for your dead baby.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.817
That's all I've ever been.
- (sighs)

21:59.819 --> 22:02.253
You got it all wrong, son.
No, I've spent my life

22:02.255 --> 22:03.621
striving for perfection,

22:03.623 --> 22:05.022
and you know why, Dad?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.691
'Cause I live in fear.

22:06.693 --> 22:08.759
That if I let up for a moment,

22:08.761 --> 22:11.762
I will remember
that I am unwanted.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.764
And then what'll happen to me?

22:15.301 --> 22:16.634
Stop.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.102
Randall. Hey,
you come here.

22:18.104 --> 22:19.303
Hmm?
- Stop.

22:19.305 --> 22:22.206
The moment I saw you,

22:22.208 --> 22:25.343
I knew you were my boy.

22:26.779 --> 22:31.048
You weren't a choice, Randall,
you were a fact.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.151
You were never
a replacement, son.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.553
Do you understand?

22:39.158 --> 22:40.558
If I had known

22:40.560 --> 22:43.461
that the man who abandoned me
regretted it...

22:43.463 --> 22:47.064
that he wanted me back...

22:47.066 --> 22:50.868
that would've made
all the difference in the world.

22:52.472 --> 22:55.639
(three distinct clicks)

22:55.641 --> 22:58.809
I'm sorry that she lied to you.
- (inhales)

22:58.811 --> 23:02.813
But we can't change that,
so what do you want to do now?

23:04.150 --> 23:06.117
(three distinct clicks)

23:07.887 --> 23:09.887
(three distinct clicks)

23:11.657 --> 23:14.392
(indistinct shouting, laughter)

23:18.731 --> 23:21.232
JACK: You gotta go
for it, go for it.

23:21.234 --> 23:23.901
Oh!
- Whoa! Big roll!

23:23.903 --> 23:24.902
Big roll.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.172
I want her to hurt
as much as I do.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.908
(indistinct chatter)

23:30.910 --> 23:35.713
Been working at a little
music shop, in the back room,

23:35.715 --> 23:39.083
you know, cleaning and, uh,
repairing instruments.

23:39.085 --> 23:40.885
It keeps me busy.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.721
Although it keeps
my hands cracked, too.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.523
(chuckles)

23:45.525 --> 23:48.793
A friend from N.A.
got me the job.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.029
N.A.?

23:52.031 --> 23:53.798
Narcotics Anonymous.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.801
Been clean for over five years.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.068
Wow.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.270
That's great.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.839
That's really good for you.

24:04.110 --> 24:06.076
How is he? Kyle?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.879
Oh, um...

24:08.881 --> 24:13.217
we... we changed his name,
actually.

24:13.219 --> 24:16.220
To Randall.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.189
After Dudley Randall.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.261
Dudley Randall.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.996
How's Randall, then?

24:25.998 --> 24:28.065
He's good.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.400
He is, um...

24:29.402 --> 24:31.902
(clears throat)

24:31.904 --> 24:34.405
He's really smart, very smart.

24:34.407 --> 24:36.073
He loves math and science,

24:36.075 --> 24:39.176
he loves G.I. Joe, he...
- (chuckles)

24:39.178 --> 24:44.315
My... my husband went out
of town for work last month

24:44.317 --> 24:45.983
and it was for the first time

24:45.985 --> 24:48.953
he's ever been away
from home for the night.

24:48.955 --> 24:52.456
And Randall slept
in my bed with me.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.158
Not because he was scared,

24:54.160 --> 24:57.161
but because he didn't
want me to be scared.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.929
He's a sweet boy.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.132
He is a very, very sweet boy.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.601
(chuckles)

25:06.839 --> 25:08.239
(car horn honks in distance)

25:12.545 --> 25:14.378
Spent the last nine years
wondering

25:14.380 --> 25:16.614
if I did the right thing.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.649
But I didn't even know

25:18.651 --> 25:21.852
your last name to look you up
in the phone book.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.725
Seems like it was right, though.

25:29.896 --> 25:32.630
For him.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.704
He's, um...

25:40.706 --> 25:43.607
he's been asking about you.

25:45.545 --> 25:50.247
He really...
wants to meet his father.

25:51.684 --> 25:55.219
And so that's why I'm here.

25:57.590 --> 26:00.057
My boy wants to meet me?

26:02.395 --> 26:06.196
Uh, maybe you can bring him
by the store sometime.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.398
Maybe.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.833
But I...
Is he musical at all?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.068
No.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.103
Maybe I can, uh,
teach him some things.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.505
Hold on, I want to show you
something.

26:14.507 --> 26:15.906
Well...

26:18.778 --> 26:21.278
I know this isn't
no Ritz-Carlton,

26:21.280 --> 26:22.846
but he'd be welcome,

26:22.848 --> 26:25.516
you know, to come over
any time and...

26:25.518 --> 26:28.519
JACK: <i>Hey, why are you
against even trying?</i>

26:28.521 --> 26:29.920
Huh?

26:37.363 --> 26:40.698
Because what if they're great?

26:40.700 --> 26:43.200
What if they regret
abandoning him

26:43.202 --> 26:44.435
and they want him back?

26:44.437 --> 26:47.705
Look, no one can take him
away from us, okay?

26:47.707 --> 26:49.306
He is legally our son.

26:49.308 --> 26:52.209
No. No one legally gave him up.

26:52.211 --> 26:53.210
There's not some sort of

26:53.212 --> 26:55.613
fire station paper trail
out there, Jack.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.781
His birth parents
could have rights

26:57.783 --> 26:59.383
and I cannot,

26:59.385 --> 27:02.052
I cannot lose my son.

27:02.054 --> 27:03.954
I can't.

27:06.058 --> 27:08.559
WILLIAM:
<i>could get a cot</i>

27:08.561 --> 27:10.060
if he wanted to stay over.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.595
Keep me from bein' scared
at night, too.

27:11.597 --> 27:13.230
Here it is.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.332
Seen better days, but...

27:15.334 --> 27:16.734
Rebecca?

27:28.748 --> 27:31.081
Oh. - Sorry. Hi. I'm
not, uh, hiding

27:31.083 --> 27:33.083
or looking through stuff,
I'm just trying

27:33.085 --> 27:34.918
to get a signal.
That's all right.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.320
I'm just here to get a sweater;
Olivia said she's cold, so...

27:38.924 --> 27:41.592
Hey, let me ask you, uh...

27:41.594 --> 27:43.927
speaking of Olivia, what's
the deal with her and Asher?

27:43.929 --> 27:45.162
Oh.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.797
I hate her.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.699
I truly hate her.

27:48.701 --> 27:51.035
You hate Olivia?
- Mm-hmm.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.770
I rented a car
to drive to Albany

27:52.772 --> 27:55.372
because my sister Elise
went into labor last night

27:55.374 --> 27:58.375
and she knew I had it
and asked me to take her here.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.844
And I said yes, because
she's the star of my play

28:00.846 --> 28:03.280
and I need her to like me.

28:03.282 --> 28:06.150
She wanted an "authentic
cabin experience."

28:06.152 --> 28:08.819
You know where
I have always dreamed

28:08.821 --> 28:11.188
about taking my
soon-to-be-born niece someday?

28:11.190 --> 28:12.656
Epcot.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.191
It's my favorite place
in the world

28:14.193 --> 28:16.193
and there's nothing
more inauthentic

28:16.195 --> 28:19.863
than their perfectly clean,
crime-free versions of

28:19.865 --> 28:22.232
international cities.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.802
I <i> love</i> inauthentic!

28:24.804 --> 28:27.037
(sighs heavily)

28:27.039 --> 28:28.338
I'm sorry.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.807
I shouldn't be talking
to you about this.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.475
No.
- Um...

28:31.477 --> 28:34.144
Your cabin is really nice.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.379
Thank you.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.647
I like this thing.

28:36.649 --> 28:40.417
I made something like it
at camp once.

28:41.854 --> 28:44.822
Is, uh... congratulations
on your niece.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.523
That's... awesome.

28:46.525 --> 28:48.926
So...
- Thank you.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.831
(line ringing)

28:53.833 --> 28:56.400
TOBY:
Hello?

28:56.402 --> 28:57.835
Hi.

28:57.837 --> 29:00.671
I... I didn't think
you were gonna pick up.

29:00.673 --> 29:04.174
Yeah. Uh... me neither.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.542
(chuckles)

29:05.544 --> 29:08.278
I know I shouldn't be
calling you, but... (exhales)

29:08.280 --> 29:11.348
my God,
Randall is seeing things,

29:11.350 --> 29:14.017
Kevin has his head up his ass
and his girlfriend...

29:14.019 --> 29:15.385
oh, my God,
she is, like, this she-demon.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.187
I don't even know
where she's from.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.589
See? And you thought the cabin

29:18.591 --> 29:19.923
wouldn't be like a horror movie.

29:19.925 --> 29:22.459
(chuckling):
Yeah.

29:25.631 --> 29:29.032
Well, I'm, uh, sorry
you're having a hard day.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.769
But are we still broken up?

29:33.405 --> 29:35.105
Well, yeah.

29:35.107 --> 29:39.543
Well, then I can't be this
person for you anymore, Kate.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.245
I'm sorry.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.313
Good-bye.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.515
(phone beeps)

29:48.754 --> 29:50.921
For our next talent show act,

29:50.923 --> 29:53.991
I will be performing "Time After
Time." OLMA: Bless her. Aw.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.626
(laughs)
(Olivia giggles)

29:55.628 --> 29:56.827
Oh, my God, look at her.

29:56.829 --> 29:58.128
REBECCA:
I love that song, sweetie.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.897
Hey!

29:59.899 --> 30:01.932
* Everybody Wang Chung tonight! *
- OLMA: Oh, my God.

30:01.934 --> 30:05.235
Ash, you've got to try
this squash. So good.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.670
KEVIN: You were taking too long
and I don't like your song!

30:06.672 --> 30:07.971
ASHER: Mm. So good.
OLMA: Right?

30:07.973 --> 30:09.406
KATE: Cyndi Lauper rules! Mmm.
- Mmm.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.074
I mean, this? Her?

30:11.076 --> 30:12.676
Don't tell your brother to shut up.
- This is...

30:12.678 --> 30:14.912
Why don't you sing a song together?
- this is everything.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.413
OLMA:
Super cute.

30:16.415 --> 30:17.781
KEVIN: No, you don't!
Okay, I...

30:17.783 --> 30:18.949
KATE: Yes, I do!

30:18.951 --> 30:21.251
(video shuts off)

30:21.253 --> 30:23.153
What the hell's going on
over there?

30:23.155 --> 30:24.354
Huh?

30:24.356 --> 30:26.089
First of all, Ash,

30:26.091 --> 30:28.292
do not "aw" every time my sister
Kate comes on the screen.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.827
I know that you're
making fun of her, all right?

30:29.829 --> 30:31.528
That's not cool.

30:31.530 --> 30:33.263
And I know you've been making
fun of this place all day long.

30:33.265 --> 30:34.832
Also not cool. You know what?

30:34.834 --> 30:36.500
It is quaint here.
It is American.

30:36.502 --> 30:38.068
But guess what?
So are we.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.604
I mean, you're not, obviously,

30:40.606 --> 30:43.774
but my point is,
what's wrong with being normal?

30:43.776 --> 30:47.511
Olivia, you're always talking
about... being real.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.112
Right?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.450
That kiss that we had yesterday,

30:53.452 --> 30:55.519
let's talk about that for
a second. That was real.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.554
Those feelings were real

30:57.556 --> 30:59.289
and I know that you know that.

30:59.291 --> 31:02.025
And it doesn't shock me
that you're scared, right?

31:02.027 --> 31:04.962
You are horrified and
you're trying to sabotage it.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.864
I understand that. But what
might be worse than that

31:06.866 --> 31:09.366
is I'm not sure you've ever
experienced anything real

31:09.368 --> 31:11.235
your entire life.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.338
I'm starting to feel like...

31:14.340 --> 31:18.809
like you attaching yourself
to something that's not...

31:18.811 --> 31:20.477
a calculated act
is just too much

31:20.479 --> 31:23.280
for your empty human shell
to handle.

31:26.752 --> 31:29.286
I feel sorry for you.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.591
And that's our cue to leave.

31:35.761 --> 31:37.661
(bowl clatters)

31:37.663 --> 31:39.897
* *

31:47.606 --> 31:49.006
(door opens)

31:49.008 --> 31:51.675
My sister had the baby!

31:51.677 --> 31:54.378
Uh, where'd they go?

31:54.380 --> 31:55.579
Uh, they left.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.080
It was a Brexit.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.383
(car leaving outside)
My car!

31:59.385 --> 32:01.084
(door slams)

32:05.925 --> 32:08.091
(leaves rustling)

32:14.300 --> 32:15.499
Hey.

32:17.803 --> 32:21.071
So, uh, on a scale of...

32:21.073 --> 32:23.206
you know, ripping off
your Barbie dolls' heads

32:23.208 --> 32:24.608
and forgetting where I hid them,

32:24.610 --> 32:27.811
to spilling marinara
on your junior prom dress,

32:27.813 --> 32:31.148
how-how mad are we?

32:31.150 --> 32:33.717
More than prom.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.286
Really?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.088
Okay.

32:38.090 --> 32:39.589
Okay, yeah, no, that's fair.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.291
Um...

32:45.064 --> 32:46.763
I'm sorry...

32:46.765 --> 32:48.231
Kate, for everything, all right?

32:48.233 --> 32:50.667
You were right about Olivia,
of course.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.739
Yeah, well,
she was right about me.

32:55.741 --> 32:59.076
What if I have the surgery

32:59.078 --> 33:01.578
and nothing changes?

33:03.415 --> 33:06.249
If you think that,
then why risk it?

33:06.251 --> 33:07.918
Kate, it's dangerous,
that's what I've been saying

33:07.920 --> 33:09.453
the whole time.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.288
Because...

33:11.290 --> 33:14.291
I'm more scared of not trying.

33:14.293 --> 33:18.028
Because I broke up with
Toby to focus on all of this.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.429
I mean, maybe
that was a stupid...

33:19.431 --> 33:20.931
I don't know, I don't know.
No, come on.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.132
I just...
(sniffs)

33:22.134 --> 33:23.533
Don't do that.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.872
(softly):
Oh, my God.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.274
* *

33:31.276 --> 33:32.609
I can't do this alone, Kevin.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.878
And I can't do it
without my brothers.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.113
You won't.

33:36.115 --> 33:39.516
You hear me?
Okay? You won't.

33:39.518 --> 33:41.218
No way.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.287
Not to make this...
about me,

33:44.289 --> 33:47.157
but... if you want do it here,
you know...

33:47.159 --> 33:48.692
I really need you here, Kate.

33:48.694 --> 33:51.094
I mean, I need you here bad.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.732
Hey, look at that.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.701
The family tree.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.136
Our names are still there,
you remember that?

33:59.138 --> 34:00.303
Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:00.305 --> 34:02.472
Look at that, our names.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.574
Oh, man.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.743
That's Dad's pocket knife.
I mean, that's kind of cool,

34:06.745 --> 34:08.078
right?

34:08.080 --> 34:11.581
"Kate was here."
(Kevin laughs)

34:11.583 --> 34:14.317
(dice clatter on board, music plays)
- Oh, man!

34:14.319 --> 34:15.685
Oh!
- Baltic again.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.821
I am on a bad roll-roll.

34:17.822 --> 34:20.190
Mom, I need to talk to you.
Kate, your turn, babe.

34:20.192 --> 34:21.992
KEVIN: Oh, no, she has to
skip her turn, remember?

34:21.994 --> 34:23.393
(Rebecca gasps)
That's right.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.262
All right, so it's my turn.
Randall?

34:25.264 --> 34:26.563
Baby, can I have the dice please?
No, no,

34:26.565 --> 34:28.398
not until you listen to me.
Here.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.001
Damn it, Randall.

34:31.003 --> 34:32.768
(Jack chuckles)
Master.

34:32.771 --> 34:33.837
Thank you very much,

34:33.839 --> 34:35.005
Look, one:

34:35.007 --> 34:36.206
you lied to me my entire life.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.375
That's 13,215 days.

34:38.377 --> 34:39.775
JACK:
Bad roll.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.344
Bad roll.
Bad roll.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.746
- REBECCA: Oh!
- What?

34:42.748 --> 34:44.014
Snake eyes.

34:44.016 --> 34:45.782
$500, please, Mr. Banker.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.717
Are you sure your mom's
not playing dirty?

34:47.719 --> 34:49.920
Two: you knew I needed something

34:49.922 --> 34:51.755
that you couldn't give me,
and you actively denied me

34:51.757 --> 34:53.623
the person who could.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.259
Look, William could've heard
my valedictorian speech.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.395
He-he could've
played music at my wedding.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.063
He could've been at the hospital
Yes!

35:00.065 --> 35:01.431
When my children were born.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.766
That's three, four, and five.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.201
You stole that from all of us.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.403
- Oh, popcorn.
- JACK: Yeah.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.605
I trusted you more
than anyone, Mom.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.574
You have robbed me
of the feeling of trust.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.810
Do you understand
how that feels?

35:15.380 --> 35:17.547
* Never leaves the station *

35:19.218 --> 35:20.617
Feel better yelling at her?

35:20.619 --> 35:24.421
No, 'cause she couldn't
care less.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.922
Come on, you're
a parent, Randall.

35:25.924 --> 35:28.058
You know that these things
aren't that simple.

35:28.060 --> 35:29.726
(dice clatters on board)

35:29.728 --> 35:31.561
(Rebecca cheers)
Maybe you're looking at this

35:31.563 --> 35:34.331
all the wrong way.
- What other way could there possibly be?

35:34.333 --> 35:37.501
Relax your eyes
and look through it.

35:37.503 --> 35:40.070
It's there right
in front of you.

35:40.072 --> 35:41.905
* Now you can make believe *

35:41.907 --> 35:43.673
* On your tin whistle *

35:49.081 --> 35:52.549
* Ah, you can be my broom boy *

35:56.755 --> 35:59.022
* Scrub me till I shine
in the dark *

35:59.024 --> 36:01.424
(three distinct clicks)

36:04.863 --> 36:06.429
* I'll be your light *

36:06.431 --> 36:09.599
What's is it? What's going on?

36:09.601 --> 36:12.536
She had three
wildly different kids.

36:12.538 --> 36:14.771
Along with their
own sets of problems.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.307
Our marriage
wasn't always perfect.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.809
I certainly wasn't.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.511
And she had her own things
to deal with, too.

36:21.513 --> 36:25.215
* And why don't you follow *

36:25.217 --> 36:26.616
JACK:
But she kept everything out.

36:26.618 --> 36:30.320
She always made
sure we were all safe.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.621
* My claw's in you *

36:31.623 --> 36:35.458
* And my light's in you *

36:38.130 --> 36:42.065
* This is your first day
of sorrow * RANDALL: Mom?

36:42.067 --> 36:43.166
(taps on window)

36:43.168 --> 36:44.734
* Everything you do *

36:44.736 --> 36:46.136
We're here.
We're right here.

36:46.138 --> 36:49.139
* Everything you do *

36:49.141 --> 36:51.641
* You do for... *

36:55.480 --> 36:57.614
* * (drill whirring)

36:59.585 --> 37:00.784
(blows)

37:18.403 --> 37:20.170
(drilling continues)
(whispering): Kev.

37:20.172 --> 37:22.172
Kev, do you hear that?

37:22.174 --> 37:23.773
Yeah.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.209
Uh-huh.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.944
Kev...

37:27.946 --> 37:29.946
is that Sloane in your bed?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.753
Hey, Kate.

37:37.856 --> 37:40.590
Well, good morning.
KEVIN: Good morning.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.699
Hey, man.
- Hey.

37:49.701 --> 37:51.534
You recovered from yesterday?

37:51.536 --> 37:53.770
Yeah.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.374
You can't be so mad at Mom
if you're fixing stuff for her.

37:57.376 --> 38:00.644
It's not for Mom.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.545
I'm doing it for Dad.

38:08.220 --> 38:11.087
RAY:
What are we here to build, boys?

38:11.089 --> 38:13.256
BOYS:
Body, spirit, community.

38:13.258 --> 38:15.625
RAY:
The three pillars.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.896
Now, before we begin, we have
a new member to initiate today.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.131
Randall,

38:21.133 --> 38:22.832
come over here.

38:22.834 --> 38:25.001
Fathers.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.407
RAY:
Randall, how old are you, son?

38:30.409 --> 38:32.909
Nine.
- Nine years old.

38:32.911 --> 38:35.278
Fine age.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.747
Do you think
you have a good life?

38:37.749 --> 38:41.284
Yeah, I think so.
(Ray chuckles) Good.

38:41.286 --> 38:44.354
Good, I hope you always
have a good life.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.323
But as you get older,
you might start to find

38:46.325 --> 38:47.824
that things get harder.

38:47.826 --> 38:52.262
The world isn't
always a kind place.

38:52.264 --> 38:56.333
Especially... for men like us.

38:56.335 --> 38:59.135
Take a look at the
people on this mat.

38:59.137 --> 39:03.006
We are your community.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.975
When things get hard,

39:05.977 --> 39:07.644
we are gonna be the ones

39:07.646 --> 39:10.880
who hold each other up.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.850
As Randall's father,
you are his foundation.

39:15.520 --> 39:17.620
Come lie down, as if
you're gonna do a push-up.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.856
Randall,
climb on your father's back.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.962
* *

39:25.964 --> 39:28.031
(clears throat)

39:29.968 --> 39:32.202
RAY:
Jack, your back

39:32.204 --> 39:35.405
was built to carry
your son through life.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.141
Are you willing to hold him up,

39:38.143 --> 39:40.043
no matter what comes his way?

39:40.045 --> 39:42.178
Yes.
- Show him.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.714
* If only you could know *

39:44.716 --> 39:46.816
(grunts)
- Good. Now keep going.

39:46.818 --> 39:50.353
* Silhouettes
and their shadows *

39:50.355 --> 39:53.556
Are you willing to
raise this young boy

39:53.558 --> 39:56.159
into a strong man?
Yes.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.694
Are you willing to push him

39:57.696 --> 39:59.596
to be the best man in the world

39:59.598 --> 40:02.999
he can be?
- Yes.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.603
* I'll go back
where we started *

40:06.605 --> 40:09.105
REBECCA:
<i>I cannot lose my son.</i>

40:09.107 --> 40:11.408
I can't.

40:11.410 --> 40:15.345
* Where we gave up
all too soon *

40:15.347 --> 40:17.514
Listen.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.617
I would never let that happen.

40:20.619 --> 40:23.019
I would never let
that happen, okay?

40:23.021 --> 40:24.554
Okay?

40:24.556 --> 40:27.757
I promise.
We need to be enough for him.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.626
We need...

40:29.628 --> 40:32.262
to be... enough for him.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.631
* When I close my eyes *

40:34.633 --> 40:36.399
RAY:
Are you willing to lift him

40:36.401 --> 40:38.802
to greater heights,
even if it hurts?

40:38.804 --> 40:40.770
Yes.
* And what doesn't work *

40:40.772 --> 40:43.473
* On this first try *

40:43.475 --> 40:45.408
(grunts)
- All right.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.110
I think that's enough.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.212
I won't stop.
* And we'll laugh *

40:49.214 --> 40:51.748
* Until the sun will rise *

40:51.750 --> 40:53.817
REBECCA:
<i>Dear William,</i>

40:53.819 --> 40:58.421
<i>I'm sorry for the pain
it may cause, but...</i>

40:58.423 --> 41:00.590
<i>you cannot meet Randall.</i>

41:00.592 --> 41:02.425
* Got a feeling
there's another one *

41:02.427 --> 41:04.060
<i>This is for the best for him.</i>

41:04.062 --> 41:05.462
<i>Because he has...</i>

41:05.464 --> 41:06.963
<i>an extraordinary father</i>

41:06.965 --> 41:10.967
<i>who gives him
everything he needs.</i>

41:10.969 --> 41:13.169
* Ooh... ooh *

41:17.242 --> 41:18.641
<i>I hope you take comfort</i>

* If all I ever do *

I have here a list of all
the reasons I came up with

41:41.099 --> 41:42.799
in the past day for why
you have destroyed me

41:42.801 --> 41:44.501
by keeping William a secret

41:44.503 --> 41:46.503
for 36 years, okay? Please.
Sweetheart, please let me explain,

41:46.505 --> 41:49.005
Uh-uh.
I, uh...

41:53.111 --> 41:55.512
You kept that secret
for 36 years.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.752

been incredibly lonely.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.830
No.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.032
Not yet.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.135
I'll see you at Christmas.
