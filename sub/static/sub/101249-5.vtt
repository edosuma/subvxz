BOIMLER:
Ensign Boimler, personal log,

01:26.586 --> 01:28.963
stardate 57601.3.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.841
The Cerritos is in orbit
around Mixtus III to assist

01:31.925 --> 01:34.469
in a controlled demolition
of an unstable moon.

01:34.552 --> 01:35.970
We're providing support
to the Vancouver,

01:36.054 --> 01:38.181
a Parliament-class ship
which focuses

01:38.264 --> 01:41.309
on complex, large-scale
engineering projects.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.521
Welcome, Captain. Take it in.

01:44.604 --> 01:47.524
One day you could be in command
of a vessel like the Vancouver.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.486
Thank you, Captain. This is
truly a humbling experience.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.612
You're welcome.
(sighs)

01:52.695 --> 01:55.740
Unfortunately, we might have
to cancel the demolition.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.700
-What? Why?
-Is the moon too dense?

01:57.784 --> 02:00.203
No, it's more
of a diplomatic issue.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.872
Diplomatic? Isn't the moon going
to plummet into the planet

02:02.956 --> 02:06.209
-and ignite the atmosphere?
-And, you know, kill everyone?

02:06.292 --> 02:08.253
I've told them that many times,
but they simply don't care.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.255
(indistinct arguing)

02:10.338 --> 02:11.881
-You don't know
what you're talking...
-Of all the moons we pray to,

02:11.965 --> 02:13.758
that's one
of the most important!

02:13.842 --> 02:15.718
It controls the tides
for our summer crop.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.555
My family has lived
on that moon for generations.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.889
Moons can't plummet.
That's something the government

02:19.973 --> 02:22.392
-made up to control us.
-(arguing continues)

02:22.475 --> 02:24.561
Ooh, boy.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.397
BOIMLER: So the moon's decaying
orbit could cause catastrophic

02:27.480 --> 02:28.898
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah-- okay, okay.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.734
The real news is I get to
have lunch with the coolest,

02:31.818 --> 02:35.238
smartest officer in Starfleet,
Barbara Brinson,

02:35.321 --> 02:39.242
who also happens
to be my girlfriend.

02:39.325 --> 02:40.785
That's right. Ugh!

02:40.869 --> 02:42.704
We met a month ago
and it's just been magical.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.747
Ooh, boy, here we go.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.916
Log number one million
about Girlfriend Barb.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.751
You know, I am sorry,
but I'm starting to think

02:48.835 --> 02:50.420
that Barb might
not actually exist.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.297
Oh, she's real.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.049
She's as real as a hopped-up
Q on Captain Picard Day.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.759
Let me guess, when we meet her,

02:56.843 --> 02:58.970
it'll weirdly have to be
on the holodeck.

02:59.053 --> 03:00.930
Hey. I don't do that anymore.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.266
-Okay?
-Sure you don't, man.
But just so you know,

03:03.349 --> 03:05.435
-I am still gonna try
waving my hand through her.
-Please don't.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.936
-I'm gonna.
-You're gonna hit skin.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.063
Well, if I do,
it's the cost of doing business.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.567
Ooh. You smell that, Tendi?

03:12.650 --> 03:15.570
Each ship on the fleet
has its own scent.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.071
I think the Cerritos smells like

03:17.155 --> 03:18.781
toasting marshmallows
on a cool night.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.491
(sniffs)
Is that a plasma fire?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.951
Huh? Oh-- uh, uh...

03:22.035 --> 03:23.828
The D53 probably sparked again.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.580
(chuckles)
They're so buggy.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.081
Yeah, the whole ship's
kind of falling apart.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.709
Yep, this old girl's
seen a lot of light-years.

03:29.792 --> 03:31.002
You know, Kula told me
the Vancouver

03:31.085 --> 03:32.503
has fluidic processors

03:32.587 --> 03:33.963
that self-replicate
their own silicas.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.340
(gasps)
Nuh-uh!

03:35.423 --> 03:36.799
And he said they had
tritanium hull brackets.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.469
-And get this: T88s.
-That can't be right.

03:39.552 --> 03:40.970
-T88s aren't even out yet.
-I know.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.431
It's a starship, not heaven.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.351
I can't believe it.

03:46.434 --> 03:48.937
This is the greatest ship
I've ever seen.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.356
Are you kidding me?
This is amazing.

03:51.439 --> 03:54.692
Uh, guys? It's basically, like,
the same ship as the Cerritos.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.487
-(both laugh)
-Yeah, right.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.988
Ooh, let's go look
at their thermal mesh.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.448
I bet it's a double lattice!

04:00.531 --> 04:01.950
-Double lattice!
-(whooping, laughing)

04:02.033 --> 04:04.661
(sighs) Where's Barb?
She said she'd meet me here.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.579
Oh, this is too sad. Hey, look.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.665
I can set you up with somebody
great on the Cerritos.

04:08.748 --> 04:09.874
There's that
Phylosian in tactical.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.042
She seems like
a nice plant person.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.502
BARB:
(gasps) Brad!

04:13.544 --> 04:14.671
(gasps)

04:14.754 --> 04:18.007
Uh, wha-- Uh, c-computer,
end program.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.009
(both laugh)

04:20.093 --> 04:22.053
I missed you so much.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.471
-(both smooching)
-Ugh.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.014
-(groaning)
-Mmm.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.475
-We kissed, did you see?
-Hi. Sorry.

04:27.558 --> 04:30.478
It's been a long month.
I'm Lieutenant Barbara Brinson.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.021
Um, yeah-- I'm, uh,
I'm Beckett Mariner,

04:32.105 --> 04:34.524
-and this is Boimler.
-(laughs): Yeah, I know.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.067
Oh! I can't wait
to show you everything.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.527
Come on.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.529
She's a lieutenant?

04:39.612 --> 04:41.406
BARB:
You know, whatever,
it was no big deal.

04:41.489 --> 04:42.573
I managed to reverse
the polarity

04:42.657 --> 04:44.033
and reboot the time stream.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.036
Good thing, too,
'cause, oof, 1920s Chicago?

04:47.120 --> 04:49.038
-Nobody's washing their hands.
-(laughs)

04:49.122 --> 04:51.040
Oh, I love that story, bun-bun.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.793
-Mwah, mwah.
-Wow, all that's so amazing.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.878
And now you date Brad.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.798
Ugh, I know. I swore
I'd never do long-distance.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.759
But then I met this goofball
on Vendu last month.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.596
He radiates a primal confidence.
I'm sure you've felt it.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.557
No, I try not to feel
anything around Brad.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.392
-Barbasaurus Rex!
-Jet?

05:09.475 --> 05:11.019
Get up here.
We're gonna be working together.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.187
-Ah! Whoa. (laughs)
-Uh...

05:13.271 --> 05:15.481
-Really?
-Okay, you can maybe
put her down now.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.191
-Like, anytime.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.068
Did you hear some purple people
are throwing a tantrum?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
Implosion's been postponed.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.406
We got to recalibrate the whole
goddamn containment field.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.907
Oh, Boim-Boim.

05:24.991 --> 05:26.909
Looks like I can't do lunch
on the Cerritos.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.870
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's not like I programmed

05:28.953 --> 05:30.538
a ten-course meal or anything.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.873
Hey. See you in Engineering.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.208
And I'll try not
to bring it downtown.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.752
-(both laugh)
-Shut up.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.587
-No, you shut up.
-Shut up.
-Huh?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.130
Ow. Ow, no, you shut up. Stop.

05:39.213 --> 05:40.882
Wait, how do you know Jet?

05:40.965 --> 05:43.092
He's, like, the second
coolest person on the Cerritos.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.927
Ugh, we dated, like,
a billion years ago.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.764
-What?
-But he's nothing compared
to my Bradward.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.933
(laughs): Oh!
Your real name is Bradward?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
Yeah, I'm a Bradward. There's
Bradleys, there's Bradwards.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.105
(inhales deeply)
It feels so good to be near you.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.983
-BOTH: Mwah!
-(laughs)

05:59.067 --> 06:01.611
Well, I got to hand it to you.
You were right.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.112
Barb is great.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.823
A little too great.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.743
Hey. Ron Docent.
Welcome aboard

06:08.826 --> 06:09.786
the Vancouver.

06:09.869 --> 06:11.162
She's a beaut, isn't she?

06:11.245 --> 06:12.163
-Oh, yeah.
-(panting)

06:12.246 --> 06:13.748
So, the captain,
your captain,

06:13.831 --> 06:15.958
has ordered us to look
for alternatives to implosion.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.668
I'm gonna have you two
run diagnostics

06:17.752 --> 06:19.045
on the simulation mainframe.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.214
You both comfortable using T88s?

06:21.297 --> 06:22.173
Yes, sir.
So comfortable.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.508
Super comfortable.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.051
-(chuckles)
-Ha. I like that enthusiasm.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.677
Tell you what,
whoever finishes first

06:26.761 --> 06:28.971
gets their very own T88.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.515
Wait. You mean, like,
we get to keep them?

06:30.598 --> 06:31.557
Or-or is this, like,
a borrow thing?

06:31.641 --> 06:33.184
Like, we're gonna have
to give them back, right?

06:33.267 --> 06:35.645
Nope. I mean keep,
like "you keep it."

06:35.728 --> 06:36.771
-Ah!
-Sorry, sir.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.523
Just checking
if this is a dream.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.982
I've got a bad feeling
about Barb.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.151
I know. I can't believe
she used to date Jet!

06:42.235 --> 06:44.737
That guy's like a Kirk sundae
with Trip Tucker sprinkles.

06:44.821 --> 06:45.822
I'm not messing around.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.824
Barb is way, way,
way out of your league.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.283
Not out of Jet's league.
I...

06:49.367 --> 06:51.661
Uh, I-I got to get jacked.
Here we go.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.788
Brad, when
a Starfleet relationship

06:53.871 --> 06:55.206
-seems too good
to be true, then...
-(exhales, grunts)

06:55.289 --> 06:56.833
red alert, man-- it probably is.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.292
(panting)
You think she's cheating on me?!

06:58.376 --> 07:01.003
No! I think she's a secret alien
who's gonna eat you

07:01.087 --> 07:03.297
or a Romulan spy
or a salt succubus

07:03.381 --> 07:04.632
or an android or a changeling

07:04.715 --> 07:06.300
or one of those sexy people
in rompers

07:06.384 --> 07:08.052
that murders you
just for going on the grass!

07:08.136 --> 07:09.637
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm sorry, you're saying

07:09.720 --> 07:11.806
that because Barb is awesome
and hot and dating me

07:11.889 --> 07:12.890
that she's an alien?

07:12.974 --> 07:14.016
That is messed up, Mariner!

07:14.100 --> 07:15.184
That is not cool.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.310
This is real, Bradward.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.020
I have seen stuff, man.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.691
Like back when I was serving
on the Quito...

07:21.774 --> 07:23.609
(laughter)

07:23.693 --> 07:25.153
You guys...

07:25.236 --> 07:27.321
Ooh, you hear what happened
on the Enterprise?

07:27.405 --> 07:29.198
Apparently,
Data's got an evil twin brother

07:29.282 --> 07:30.825
who teamed up with the Borg.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.034
-Crazy, right?
-(chuckles)

07:32.118 --> 07:35.204
What? Man, it's like a new thing
every week with those guys.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.540
Right. Like, leave some unknown
for the rest of us.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.667
(laughing)

07:39.750 --> 07:41.878
Aw, you guys
are such a great couple.

07:41.961 --> 07:42.879
Oh, what can I say?

07:42.962 --> 07:44.338
I found the perfect guy.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.048
Look, I'm not perfect, okay?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.009
But I do have
the perfect friends.

07:48.092 --> 07:50.219
Uh, no, Niko,
you are the nicest, smartest,

07:50.303 --> 07:52.054
handsomest guy on this ship.

07:52.138 --> 07:52.889
I mean, it's either that

07:52.972 --> 07:54.891
or you're
a Harvongian shape-changer.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.058
-(laughing)
-(hissing)

07:56.142 --> 07:58.978
I mean, you're too handsome.
(laughs)

07:59.061 --> 08:00.605
-(snarling)
-Niko?

08:00.688 --> 08:03.191
-(shouts)
-(groaning)

08:03.274 --> 08:04.233
(screeching)

08:04.317 --> 08:05.359
-(screams)
-No!

08:05.443 --> 08:08.070
Shape-changer!

08:08.154 --> 08:09.071
Angie!

08:09.155 --> 08:10.740
No...!

08:10.823 --> 08:13.075
I'm not gonna sit around
and let a face get melted.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.243
Not again.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.369
You're not leaving my sight,
mister.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.913
Every minute
Barb spends with Jet

08:16.996 --> 08:18.122
puts me closer to losing her.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.290
I got to do something.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.168
And so do I.

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
(overlapping arguing)

08:29.967 --> 08:32.094
Okay, listen up!
We will relocate

08:32.178 --> 08:34.597
three tons of moon dust
for people to worship.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.974
The farmers will have gravity
systems installed for the tides.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.060
And you three,
your ancestral homes

08:39.143 --> 08:41.103
will be relocated
to the sixth moon,

08:41.187 --> 08:43.773
which will now technically
be the fifth anyway.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.608
Does that work for everyone?

08:45.691 --> 08:47.777
-Yeah.
-It works for me.
-Okay.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.278
(indistinct chatter)

08:49.362 --> 08:51.280
No, you don't understand.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.866
This moon blocks pollution
from Mixtus III

08:53.950 --> 08:55.660
from reaching my people

08:55.743 --> 08:58.246
Without this moon, we'll perish.

But if we don't destroy it,

08:59.413 --> 09:01.290

will perish.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.960
I know.
It's an impossible problem.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.920

Well, we're Starfleet.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.964
Figuring out impossible problems
is what we do,

-No! If you blow up that moon,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.304
you're murderers!
You'll have blood on your hands!

09:55.428 --> 09:57.013
Okay, she's not an android,

16:28.320 --> 16:29.738
COMPUTER:
Warning. Platform approaching

16:29.822 --> 16:31.281
-critical altitude.
-Whoa!

16:31.365 --> 16:33.283
-(alarm blaring)
-Boimler!

16:35.786 --> 16:37.037
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

16:37.121 --> 16:38.038
BOTH:
Stay away from him!

16:38.122 --> 16:39.665
(both grunt)

16:39.748 --> 16:42.042
The Vancouver is awesome.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.045
The fluidic processors,
the tritanium hull brackets,

16:45.129 --> 16:46.088
the door whoosh.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.256
BOTH:
Whoosh.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.550
Honestly, the Cerritos
might be falling apart,

16:49.633 --> 16:51.093
but that's kind of awesome, too.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.511
It's our job
to keep it together.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.263
Yeah, and the way
that she shakes and creaks

16:54.346 --> 16:55.556
and moans at Warp 7?

16:55.639 --> 16:56.724
I bet the Vancouver
doesn't do that.

16:56.807 --> 16:57.766
With those inertial dampers?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.268
(chuckles)
You got to be kidding me.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.519
And you know what
the Vancouver doesn't have?

17:00.602 --> 17:03.063
-All our friends.
-We have to tell Ron
we're staying here.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.189
What if, what if
he gets mad at us?

17:04.273 --> 17:07.109
He's a professional.
Professionals don't get pissed.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.737
-What?!
-I'm sorry, but we want
to stay on the Cerritos.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.697
Tough! I already
wrote up the transfer.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.324
As soon as I click this button,
it's going through.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.744
Wait a second, you can't just
transfer us against our will!

17:16.827 --> 17:18.620
(sputters) Watch me.
Do I need to remind you

17:18.704 --> 17:20.330
who my grandma's neighbor was?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.249
I guess I do--
it was the admiral!

17:22.332 --> 17:23.751
-And he's a psycho.
-(grunts)

17:23.834 --> 17:25.753
-Hey, you can't do that!
-(grunts)

17:25.836 --> 17:27.755
Don't kick me PADD!
That's an order!

17:27.838 --> 17:29.298
-Aah!
-(grunts)

17:29.381 --> 17:30.340
Hey, got it!

17:30.424 --> 17:32.426
-(shouts)
-Get back here!

17:32.509 --> 17:33.594
Don't kill my people!

17:33.677 --> 17:35.137
You're the Federation!

17:35.220 --> 17:36.430
You're the good guys!

17:36.513 --> 17:38.265
Remember the Prime Directive?

17:38.348 --> 17:40.100
What? That doesn't
even apply here!

17:40.184 --> 17:42.102
Captain, we're
running out of time.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.312
The flooding has already
started and the platforms

17:43.395 --> 17:45.189
weren't designed for this.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.442
(both grunting)

17:48.525 --> 17:50.819
I'm not letting you
hurt Boimler!

17:50.903 --> 17:52.613
I'm protecting him!

17:52.696 --> 17:54.698
-From what?
-Hyah!

17:54.782 --> 17:58.702
From you! You really think I'd
buy you guys are best friends?

17:58.786 --> 18:00.287
He's mousey, sweet and soft

18:00.370 --> 18:02.164
and you're a badass
space adventurer!

18:02.247 --> 18:04.291
-(grunts)
-I knew there was
something wrong

18:04.374 --> 18:05.459
from the moment I met you.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.753
-Yeah, no, something's
wrong with you.
-(grunts)

18:07.836 --> 18:11.131
First, I thought you were
a rogue holodeck character.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.842
Then, because of the way you
were lurking around all day,

18:13.926 --> 18:17.137
I thought you were
a Breen infiltrator. (grunts)

18:17.221 --> 18:19.681
What? That wasn't lurking--
that was protecting!

18:19.765 --> 18:23.143
Finally I realized
you're probably a parasite!

18:23.227 --> 18:24.311
(both grunt)

18:24.394 --> 18:25.312
Bitch, you're the parasite!

18:25.395 --> 18:29.316
Exactly what a parasite
would say, parasite!

18:29.399 --> 18:30.317
(both panting)

18:30.400 --> 18:31.819
(gasps)

18:31.902 --> 18:33.570
-Give me back my PADD!
-Let's go!

18:33.654 --> 18:35.280
(both grunt)

18:35.364 --> 18:38.242
Do not get on that turbolift!

18:40.244 --> 18:41.578
Here's the plan-- I'll reroute
the turbolift controls.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.372
You try to guess his passcode!

18:43.455 --> 18:44.540
RON:
Give me back my PADD!

18:44.623 --> 18:47.876
The impact on our environment
would affect both of us!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.878
We'd have to move
our whole civilization!

18:49.962 --> 18:51.547
I know! But how can...?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.674
Wait, "both"? What do you,
what do you mean "both"?

18:53.757 --> 18:55.717
How many people are
in your civilization?

18:55.801 --> 18:58.720
-Me and my wife.
-There are two (bleep) people

18:58.804 --> 19:01.223
on your whole (bleep) planet?!

19:01.306 --> 19:03.350
Well, yes, we're,
uh, we're rich.

19:03.433 --> 19:04.852
Implode the moon.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.687
-Yes, Captain.
-You maniacs!

19:06.770 --> 19:09.523
We just redid the floors!

19:15.946 --> 19:18.240
(huffs, spits)

19:18.323 --> 19:19.324
This isn't over.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.742
You don't know Boimler
like I do.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.202
He will figure you out.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.579
I mean, sometimes
it takes him a minute.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.539
Hell, on Sendu IV,
it took him a week to realize

19:25.622 --> 19:28.292
he was peeing in their species'
sinks and not their toilets,

19:28.375 --> 19:29.710
but you know what,
he gets there eventually.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.919
Wait, that was him?

19:31.003 --> 19:32.713
He told me that happened
to a friend.

19:32.796 --> 19:33.630
Yeah, he wishes.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.257
No, someone came in
to wash their hands,

19:35.340 --> 19:37.217
and just caught him going
right in the sink.

19:37.301 --> 19:38.385
(laughs)

19:38.468 --> 19:40.304
You know what?
On our second date,

19:40.387 --> 19:43.640
he "shook hands"
with a Lortian's egg sac.

19:43.724 --> 19:46.268
(laughing):
Oh, stop!

19:46.351 --> 19:47.603
It was so pissed.

19:47.686 --> 19:51.523
(both laughing)

19:51.607 --> 19:53.942
Okay, and then, and then
Sqill looked at Boimler

19:54.026 --> 19:56.445
and said, "That's my dorsal."

19:56.528 --> 19:58.238
(both laughing)

19:58.322 --> 20:00.449
You guys have been
through a lot together.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.577
Yeah, I mean he is a dork,
for sure.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.245
But he's my dork.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.955
Well, you're clearly
not a parasite,

20:07.039 --> 20:09.625
or you wouldn't have let him
(bleep) in front of the admiral.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.460
Uh, well, thanks,
and, you know,

20:11.543 --> 20:13.837
you're not seeming so much like
a parasite, either, by the way.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.632
Hey, if it's gonna make you
feel better, just scan me.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.633
(scanner trilling)

20:17.716 --> 20:19.843
You are a human, yep.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.428
Man, I mean,
you ever get those feelings

20:21.511 --> 20:22.638
like you are just sure
about something?

20:22.721 --> 20:23.764
Like, I was sure
you were a parasite.

20:23.847 --> 20:24.806
But you're actually a very nice,

20:24.890 --> 20:25.933
attractive human woman.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.894
(scanner blipping)

20:28.977 --> 20:30.270
Uh-oh.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.271
(whimpering)

20:31.355 --> 20:33.357
-Aah!
-This isn't me!

20:33.440 --> 20:34.816
I don't want to stun you.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.818
-Then don't!
-Come on, come on!

20:36.902 --> 20:38.445
Give me back my PADD!

20:38.528 --> 20:39.947
Look, just hand me
the phaser-- ow!

20:40.030 --> 20:41.782
Oh, my God,
you made me stun you!

20:41.865 --> 20:43.283
I can't feel my hand!

20:43.367 --> 20:45.786
Oh, God, oh, God!
What have I done?

20:45.869 --> 20:47.871
-Ow!
-I got the password--
it was "Riker."

20:47.955 --> 20:49.289
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't read that!

20:49.373 --> 20:50.374
What the heck?

20:50.457 --> 20:53.001
You're transferring yourself
to the Cerritos?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.795
I thought we could swap places.

20:54.878 --> 20:56.713
You don't know
what it's like here!

20:56.797 --> 20:58.715
It's so stressful!
It's so epic!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.509
It's all,
"Tow this space station,"

21:00.592 --> 21:01.760
and, "Calibrate
the Dyson sphere!"

21:01.843 --> 21:04.846
"Go back in time and kill the
guy that was worse than Hitler!"

21:04.930 --> 21:07.015
I just want to be back
on a smaller ship,

21:07.099 --> 21:08.642
doing simpler work.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.311
(crying):
I don't want
to be epic anymore!

21:11.395 --> 21:14.564
Geez, working on
the Vancouver screws you up.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.358
I'm sorry I phasered you.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.819
This is not
Ron Emmanuel Docent, Jr.

21:18.902 --> 21:20.988
Can we just keep this
between us?

21:21.071 --> 21:23.865
You'll delete
the transfer order?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.492
There. Done.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.328
And, um, throw in a T88
for each of us.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.330
Hey, now, that I can't do.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.332
Oh, that's cool. It wasn't
like I was using my implant

21:32.416 --> 21:34.710
to record all this as evidence
for your court-martial.

21:34.793 --> 21:36.670
(chuckles)
I was.

21:36.753 --> 21:39.673
Okay, a couple of T88s
coming right up.

21:39.756 --> 21:41.758
(scanner blipping)

21:47.806 --> 21:49.057
Ooh! Ugh!

21:49.141 --> 21:50.892
It's squishy!
Give me a hand!

21:50.976 --> 21:52.561
Oh, my God!

21:52.644 --> 21:55.522
Stop! Don't! Lover! Lover!

21:55.605 --> 21:57.983
Lover! Lover!
Lover! Lover! Lover!

21:58.066 --> 21:59.026
Oh, God.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.610
Aah! What the hell was that?

22:00.694 --> 22:02.779
It was always me, Barb.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.406
I'm going to treat you
to dinner.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.033
Let me out! Let me out!

22:06.116 --> 22:07.909
Hmm, apparently,
this species reproduces

22:07.993 --> 22:10.537
by making their host
chemically irresistible

22:10.620 --> 22:11.872
to potential mates.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.457
So Boimler must have
picked it up...

22:13.540 --> 22:15.083
Right before he met me, exactly.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.044
Wait. Wait.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.546
So are you saying you only liked
me because of the parasite?

22:19.629 --> 22:21.381
Please. I'm a Starfleet officer.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.550
You think I'd be into a guy
just because of his pheromones?

22:23.633 --> 22:25.969
Oh, thank God. I was worried
you were gonna break up with me.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.430
Yeah, listen, Brad,
you're sweet,

22:28.513 --> 22:31.558
but right now, I need to put
all my energy into my job.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.435
Specifically, studying
this fascinating parasite.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.936
Lover! Lover!
Lover! Lover! Lover!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.396
-Lover! Lover! Lover! Lover!
-Mwah.

22:36.480 --> 22:37.439
-Lover! Lover! Lover! Lover!
-Aw.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.399
She did break up with me.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.776
Hey, you'll find someone
who loves you

22:40.859 --> 22:42.736
without a googa attached
to your skull.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.071
You're just saying that.

22:44.154 --> 22:45.947
No, I'm not.
You're a catch, man.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.492
-You're real.
-I am real.

22:48.575 --> 22:51.078
Hey, Mare, see you next month
at the M'tari tournament?

22:51.161 --> 22:55.749
Oh, you know it, and I'll try
not to bring it downtown.

22:55.832 --> 22:58.126
-(laughing)
-Oh, shut up.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.920
Wait. You guys made plans?

23:00.003 --> 23:01.421
We bonded
while you were knocked out.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.632
-Over what?
-Nothing. Just girl stuff.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.801
So you shook
a Lortian's egg sack?

23:05.884 --> 23:08.178
Wait, how did...?
Oh. Oh, no! Oh, no!

23:10.055 --> 23:11.598
Aah.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.100
The Cerritos might be
falling apart,

23:13.183 --> 23:14.810
but it's nice to be back home.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.979
Yeah, I missed that smoky smell.
(chuckles)

23:18.063 --> 23:20.440
So, uh, hey, um,
before we left the Vancouver,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.652
I got you something.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.820
(chuckles)
You shouldn't have!

23:24.903 --> 23:26.613
Well, I figured
the Cerritos could use them

23:26.696 --> 23:27.948
-a lot more than...
-No, no, no.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.450
I mean, look,
I stole a bunch, too.

23:30.534 --> 23:31.910
-(laughs)
-Yup, this...

23:31.993 --> 23:33.662
this is why we're friends.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.998
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

25:03.877 --> 25:05.295
(man imitates weapons firing)

25:07.297 --> 25:08.298
Chirp.
