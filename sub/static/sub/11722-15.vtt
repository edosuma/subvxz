00:00.660 --> 00:02.311
Previously on
"The Secret Circle..."

00:02.312 --> 00:05.623
You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.

00:05.624 --> 00:07.017
A complete circle is 6.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.103
You complete
the circle.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.844
This is about
devil's spirit.

00:09.911 --> 00:12.844
You went through
that last bag a little fast.

00:12.912 --> 00:14.416
I told you
it's dangerous stuff.

00:14.787 --> 00:17.275
It took someone
very important away from me.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.910
Your old girlfriend.
I know.

00:19.021 --> 00:20.597
It's a power totem.

00:20.622 --> 00:21.553
Put this on your bed
for a few weeks,

00:21.554 --> 00:24.132
and you'll be left with
nothing but pure power.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.533
I figured out a way
to make you better.

00:25.635 --> 00:26.735
When I was holding
the medallion,

00:26.770 --> 00:28.278
I felt an incredibly
clear connection

00:28.345 --> 00:29.579
to my father.

00:31.451 --> 00:34.255
He's had 16 years
to look for you.

00:34.357 --> 00:36.560
The minute Cassie activated
the medallion,

00:36.661 --> 00:38.997
she alerted every dead witch
whose power it's taken.

00:39.065 --> 00:40.465
The power's tied
to the medallion.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.268
My father...

00:42.369 --> 00:45.371
I think I let the idea of him
overshadow the reality.

00:45.405 --> 00:48.607
I think he should stay
wherever he's been hiding.

00:51.779 --> 00:53.478
Moving out?

00:53.579 --> 00:55.916
Actually, yeah.

00:55.984 --> 00:57.818
Wait, what?

00:57.886 --> 00:59.422
Seriously?
Yeah.

00:59.490 --> 01:01.123
My grandmother, she's coming
back from the clinic.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.191
Tonight, actually.

01:02.225 --> 01:05.129
That's great news.

01:05.197 --> 01:07.032
The grandmother part--
not you moving out.

01:07.102 --> 01:10.905
I know. She's almost back
to her old self, though.

01:11.006 --> 01:13.610
But I really will miss
your snoring.

01:13.711 --> 01:16.614
Imagine me without you around
asking if I'm awake,

01:16.715 --> 01:18.417
how will I know when it's
the middle of the night?

01:18.518 --> 01:21.020
Well, I will call you from home
whenever I can't sleep.

01:21.054 --> 01:22.922
I promise.

01:23.023 --> 01:25.925
Come in.

01:26.026 --> 01:27.527
Morning.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.529
These college catalogs just
came in the mail.

01:29.564 --> 01:31.766
I thought you both
should take a look.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.535
Cassie's leaving us.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.236
Her grandmother's back.

01:36.939 --> 01:38.172
Mmm.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.141
Dad, are you ok?

01:40.242 --> 01:43.244
Yeah, of course.
Just surprised.

01:43.278 --> 01:45.447
Diana told me about you getting
a job at Java Brew.

01:45.548 --> 01:48.183
And I guess between that
and you moving out,

01:48.251 --> 01:50.586
it feels like my newest
daughter's all grown up.

01:50.654 --> 01:53.056
- I know.
- It's all so exciting.

01:53.157 --> 01:54.892
So when can I start
getting my free coffee?

01:54.959 --> 01:56.495
I'll probably be fired
by lunchtime.

01:56.562 --> 01:58.363
No, you're going to be
the best barista ever.

01:58.464 --> 02:01.199
Or at least the cutest one.
Just work that angle.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.068
Well,
good luck, Cassie.

02:03.170 --> 02:07.408
And I'm thrilled
to hear about Jane.

02:07.475 --> 02:08.876
Thank you.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.680
And thank you for
looking after me.

02:11.781 --> 02:14.583
It was our pleasure.

02:21.192 --> 02:24.928
Why do all the men in my life
like you more than me?

02:26.130 --> 02:27.697
Kidding.

02:27.732 --> 02:29.699
Mmm!

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.026 --> 02:55.027
Hello?

02:59.868 --> 03:01.135
Who's there?

03:08.544 --> 03:11.146
I've already called
the police.

03:13.649 --> 03:15.650
I wouldn't open that
if I were you.

03:15.751 --> 03:17.585
Very bad luck.

03:17.653 --> 03:18.987
What the hell
are you doing here?

03:19.055 --> 03:21.589
I thought I saw someone
from my place.

03:21.657 --> 03:24.793
Then
your door was open.

03:24.860 --> 03:26.662
Really?

03:26.696 --> 03:29.966
Everythng's fine.
I checked.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.570
You think someone broke in to
tidy the place up a little?

03:39.278 --> 03:41.279
They missed a spot.

03:41.380 --> 03:43.782
Where'd
that come from?

03:43.816 --> 03:47.486
I must have tracked it in
from outside.

03:51.391 --> 03:53.692
What's going on?

03:54.994 --> 03:57.396
Ash mixed with salt.

03:57.430 --> 04:00.212
The kind of stuff
witch hunters use to

04:00.237 --> 04:01.333
block a witch's power.

04:01.334 --> 04:03.402
Isaac warned me.

04:03.436 --> 04:04.737
He said they'd
come after you.

04:04.804 --> 04:07.807
I didn't expect them
so soon.

04:09.543 --> 04:11.113
They're here.

04:26.962 --> 04:28.662
Isaac wanted
the medallion--

04:28.763 --> 04:30.664
power of
a thousand witches,

04:30.765 --> 04:33.567
the only way to stop a witch
hunter attack on dark magic.

04:33.668 --> 04:35.502
Then he was furious
wen I told him it was destroyed.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.604
That doesn't make sense.
He's not a witch.

04:37.672 --> 04:39.172
He couldn't use it
anyway.

04:39.273 --> 04:41.608
I don't get it.
But they're obviously in town,

04:41.676 --> 04:43.076
and I'm not
leaving you alone.

04:43.177 --> 04:45.178
No, I don't need
a babysitter,

04:45.212 --> 04:48.883
and definitely not one
with uncontrollable anger issues.

04:48.984 --> 04:52.487
I'll be safer with this,

04:52.521 --> 04:55.390
mixed with a little
individual power.

04:55.491 --> 04:57.493
What the hell?

04:57.594 --> 05:01.430
See? I can more than
take care of myself.

05:26.023 --> 05:32.228
We have a mocha,
half 2%, half soy milk.

05:32.262 --> 05:36.132
An Earl Grey tea, steamed,
no water.

05:36.166 --> 05:39.769
And a short, skinny,
decaf vanilla latte.

05:39.836 --> 05:41.771
We haven't
ordered yet.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.141
Right.

05:51.983 --> 05:53.750
Carry the tray
with your weak hand

05:53.785 --> 05:54.851
so you can serve
with your strong one.

05:54.953 --> 05:56.887
Ok.
And it's all about balance.

05:56.955 --> 05:59.590
Yours and the tray's.
Bend your knees.

05:59.658 --> 06:00.591
Just a little.

06:00.659 --> 06:01.859
Oh, too much.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.261
First cup goes
in the center.

06:04.296 --> 06:06.797
The others form
a circle around it.

06:06.865 --> 06:08.565
Or you could just
work here for me?

06:08.600 --> 06:10.467
I'll split
my minimum wage with you.

06:10.568 --> 06:14.204
Um, that's...

06:23.280 --> 06:24.414
Hi.

06:24.481 --> 06:26.883
Here you go.

06:26.984 --> 06:28.619
Earl Grey.

06:28.686 --> 06:31.489
Mm.

06:37.596 --> 06:39.597
Look, I've actually got
to get to the boathouse.

06:39.698 --> 06:42.901
Um, look at us,
a couple of working stiffs.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.904
Oh. Uh...

06:47.206 --> 06:50.108
Someone was
in my house.

06:50.209 --> 06:51.910
I think
witch hunters.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.112
What?
How do you know?

06:54.213 --> 06:55.747
When were
you even there?

06:55.814 --> 06:57.115
Uh, this morning.

06:57.149 --> 06:58.616
I moved
out of Diana's.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.851
Well, I told her
my grandmother was back.

07:00.919 --> 07:02.820
- Is she?
- No.

07:02.854 --> 07:04.655
I've just imposed on
Diana for too long,

07:04.723 --> 07:06.424
and I want to sleep
in my own bed.

07:06.525 --> 07:08.459
Well, that's definitely
not going to happen now.

07:08.527 --> 07:10.128
Adam, yes, it is.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.464
Look, I just served a bunch
of raging caffeine addicts.

07:12.532 --> 07:14.233
Witch hunters
don't scare me.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.435
Yeah, maybe not,
but I'm coming over anyway.

07:16.536 --> 07:18.738
Adam, that's not
what I'm saying.

07:18.773 --> 07:21.675
Relax,
not to watch over you.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.543
A witch hunter attack is
a good excuse

07:23.577 --> 07:25.645
for me to spend some time with
you in an otherwise empty house

07:25.747 --> 07:28.448
I like your style,
Conant.

07:31.452 --> 07:33.353
Guess they'll serve
anybody, right?

07:33.388 --> 07:35.756
Mm, yes,
but not well.

07:39.694 --> 07:42.863
The queen bee serving me
a latte on bent knees.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.665
Life is good.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.669
Waitress?
Refill here.

07:48.704 --> 07:52.407
Oh, come on, Faye.
Get over it.

07:52.475 --> 07:53.475
Get over what?

07:53.509 --> 07:55.811
Jake's thing
for Cassie.

07:55.879 --> 07:57.780
She can have him.
I don't care.

07:57.881 --> 07:59.782
Look,
if you're so over Jake,

07:59.883 --> 08:02.986
why don't you
just move on?

08:03.087 --> 08:04.788
Lee is into you.

08:04.822 --> 08:06.389
Lee?

08:06.490 --> 08:07.991
Date below
my station?

08:08.092 --> 08:11.728
No. Total
power mismatch.

08:13.397 --> 08:15.597
Speaking
of slumming...

08:16.732 --> 08:18.099
Hey, there.

08:18.133 --> 08:20.334
Callum.

08:20.402 --> 08:22.603
I'm throwing a party
at my place later.

08:22.638 --> 08:24.805
You ladies interested in making
it even more awesome?

08:24.839 --> 08:26.407
No, thanks.

08:26.441 --> 08:29.242
We're just sticking
to a coffee buzz these days.

08:29.310 --> 08:31.010
It might be fun.

08:31.112 --> 08:32.511
We'll think about it.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.248
Great.
I'll text you my address.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.519
Hmm.

08:39.620 --> 08:43.022
What? He's not
what you think.

08:43.056 --> 08:46.458
He's actually
an ok guy.

08:46.526 --> 08:51.028
Yeah? I bet you could
get a two-for-one deal in rehab.

08:53.131 --> 08:56.466
Yeah, staying
with Diana is great.

08:56.533 --> 08:59.834
But I'll be glad when you're
ready to come home.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.537
I miss you, grandma.

09:07.241 --> 09:10.777
Ok, ok. All right.
I love you, too.

09:16.449 --> 09:18.450
Jake?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.618
Hello, Cassie.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.787
My name's
John Blackwell.

09:52.822 --> 09:54.889
I'm your father.

10:06.861 --> 10:10.564
How do I know
you're really my father?

10:13.969 --> 10:17.171
You know.
You sense it.

10:23.277 --> 10:26.179
Does this mean
that you...

10:26.280 --> 10:28.381
Are actually alive?

10:30.585 --> 10:32.185
I owe you
an explanation.

10:32.220 --> 10:33.920
Oh, don't bother.

10:33.988 --> 10:35.822
I'm pretty much
gotten used to the idea

10:35.890 --> 10:37.491
of you not being around.

10:38.994 --> 10:40.627
Let's just keep it
that way.

10:40.695 --> 10:43.531
I couldn't let anybody know
that I was alive.

10:43.598 --> 10:45.199
But once you activated
the medallion,

10:45.233 --> 10:46.734
I knew that
you were in trouble.

10:46.802 --> 10:49.002
I've been in trouble
a lot lately.

10:49.103 --> 10:51.038
Your timing
kind of sucks.

10:52.440 --> 10:55.308
You need to go.

10:58.613 --> 10:59.813
What?

10:59.914 --> 11:01.615
I don't
want you here.

11:01.716 --> 11:02.916
I don't need
your help.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.751
Yes, you do.

11:12.829 --> 11:14.663
Let me explain.

11:14.731 --> 11:18.033
Meet me at the end of the
boardwalk in one hour.

11:18.068 --> 11:20.937
Once I know you're safe,
you never have to see me again.

11:20.971 --> 11:22.872
Tell me now.
That's Adam.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.773
Anything you say to me, I'm
just going to tell him anyway.

11:24.841 --> 11:26.341
You can't.

11:26.376 --> 11:28.743
No one can know
that I'm here.

11:28.778 --> 11:30.745
The only reason why
I stayed away all this time

11:30.846 --> 11:32.880
was to protect you.

11:32.948 --> 11:36.183
Everything that I've done since
the day of the boat yard fire

11:36.251 --> 11:38.169
was to keep you from
being in the very situation

11:38.194 --> 11:39.394
you are right now.

11:50.664 --> 11:51.998
Hey, there.

11:53.868 --> 11:54.968
Hi.

11:55.069 --> 11:56.169
You ok?

11:56.203 --> 11:58.204
Yeah. Yeah.
Totally.

11:58.272 --> 12:00.373
Ok.
Well, I was thinking

12:00.474 --> 12:03.309
maybe we could,
I don't know, go see a movie

12:03.377 --> 12:04.677
or get something to eat.

12:04.711 --> 12:08.314
I'm sorry, but, um...
something came up.

12:08.381 --> 12:09.615
I--I can meet you later.

12:11.918 --> 12:16.388
Cassie,
what's going on?

12:16.489 --> 12:19.090
My father was here.

12:19.125 --> 12:22.093
What?
Yeah.

12:22.194 --> 12:25.597
You know that, uh, that spell
I did with the medallion?

12:28.234 --> 12:32.204
And it turns out that
he felt mine, too.

12:32.239 --> 12:33.839
He came back,
because I called him.

12:33.907 --> 12:35.341
So he really is alive.

12:35.409 --> 12:37.443
Yes. Eh.

12:37.544 --> 12:39.112
Where is he now?
He left.

12:39.213 --> 12:41.114
He doesn't want anyone
to know he's here.

12:41.148 --> 12:43.016
Why not?
I don't know.

12:43.117 --> 12:46.418
But he wants me
to meet him later.

12:46.452 --> 12:47.819
You're not going to,
right?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.554
Cassie,

12:49.622 --> 12:52.924
all those stories we've heard
about who he is,

12:53.025 --> 12:54.226
the evil things
he's done...

12:54.260 --> 12:57.428
He's actually here now.

12:57.529 --> 12:58.775
Ok? I can ask him.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.497
I can find out the truth
about who he is

13:01.733 --> 13:04.368
and what happened to
our parents' circle.

13:05.637 --> 13:06.938
Then I'm coming
with you.

13:07.039 --> 13:11.243
Adam, he's not going
to hurt me.

13:11.277 --> 13:13.278
I'm his daughter.

13:13.346 --> 13:14.847
He said
I was in danger.

13:14.948 --> 13:16.749
He wanted to help.

13:16.850 --> 13:20.253
He's had a lot
of chances to help.

13:20.287 --> 13:22.555
He's here
for something else.

13:22.656 --> 13:25.791
Then I better
find out what.

13:39.972 --> 13:41.172
Hello.

13:41.273 --> 13:43.274
Hey, it's Diana.
Is Melissa with you?

13:43.308 --> 13:44.408
No.

13:44.476 --> 13:45.977
Well, she was supposed
to come over,

13:46.078 --> 13:47.278
and she's really late.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.913
I can't get
a hold of her.

13:48.981 --> 13:51.783
It's adorable how clingy
you are in relationships.

13:51.817 --> 13:53.485
I mean, it worked out
so well with Adam,

13:53.586 --> 13:55.620
I can see why you'd do
the same thing with Melissa.

13:55.688 --> 13:59.124
I'm her friend, and I just
want to make sure she's ok.

13:59.191 --> 14:01.679
After everything that
happened at your place,

14:01.704 --> 14:02.694
I'm just worried.

14:02.695 --> 14:06.097
Well, she's at a party,
at Callum's.

14:06.131 --> 14:08.200
Callum?

14:08.301 --> 14:09.935
The guy who gave her
devil's spirit?

14:10.003 --> 14:12.004
Aren't you
freaking out?

14:12.105 --> 14:14.040
What if she's using
that stuff again?

14:14.107 --> 14:15.241
Yeah.

14:15.309 --> 14:18.011
I was just sitting here,
freaking out.

14:18.045 --> 14:19.613
I mean,
I'm her best friend,

14:19.714 --> 14:21.449
so of course
I was freaking out.

14:21.517 --> 14:23.217
God.

14:23.318 --> 14:25.019
We have to do something,
don't we?

14:25.120 --> 14:27.422
Totally.
I was just going to say that.

14:27.457 --> 14:29.524
Where is Callum's house?

14:29.625 --> 14:32.426
I don't know.

14:32.527 --> 14:34.628
But I know who does.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.192
Ladies.

15:07.661 --> 15:09.662
What a pleasant
surprise.

15:14.801 --> 15:16.068
What,
no kiss this time?

15:16.169 --> 15:18.871
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

15:18.905 --> 15:21.073
Well, I could
refresh your memory.

15:21.107 --> 15:23.810
Put it away, Lee.
This isn't a booty call.

15:23.877 --> 15:25.478
We're looking for
Callum's address.

15:25.513 --> 15:27.181
Melissa's at his party,

15:27.282 --> 15:28.682
and we're worried
about her.

15:28.783 --> 15:30.984
You let her go to
Callum's party by herself?

15:31.086 --> 15:32.886
Yes, mommy.

15:32.988 --> 15:35.423
Now just give us the address,
and we'll be on our way.

15:37.426 --> 15:39.127
What are you doing?

15:39.195 --> 15:41.130
I'm going with you.

15:41.197 --> 15:42.998
You don't think
we can handle ourselves?

15:43.099 --> 15:45.334
I get it.
You guys are witches.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.802
But voodoo's a whole
different world.

15:47.837 --> 15:49.838
There's a right
and left hand path.

15:49.906 --> 15:51.839
Callum practices
left--

15:51.907 --> 15:54.508
evil,
malicious juju.

15:54.543 --> 15:56.810
Some of the people that go to his
parties don't come back the same.

15:56.911 --> 15:58.345
So you sure you still
want to go alone?

15:58.413 --> 16:01.014
Aw, he cares.

16:01.115 --> 16:02.415
Callum uses people.

16:02.516 --> 16:04.017
He'll take
whatever you've got.

16:04.118 --> 16:05.351
And what you guys have,

16:05.419 --> 16:07.321
he'll take
any way he can.

16:07.355 --> 16:09.924
Now, come on.
Let's go.

16:15.264 --> 16:18.434
Hi.

16:20.637 --> 16:22.638
I'm glad you came.

16:24.841 --> 16:28.177
I don't know
where to start.

16:28.244 --> 16:31.079
I have an entire childhood and
adolescence worth of questions.

16:31.147 --> 16:32.881
And you aren't sure
if you can trust me.

16:32.949 --> 16:36.551
I'm sure that I don't.
Why would I?

16:36.586 --> 16:40.155
Because
I'm your father.

16:40.256 --> 16:43.258
Yeah, well,
there's also the whole

16:43.359 --> 16:46.595
our-family-line-is-pure-evil
thing.

16:46.663 --> 16:48.765
There are a lot of
stories out there.

16:48.866 --> 16:52.702
But the truth is bigger, and
I think you know that.

16:52.770 --> 16:54.694
I'm pretty solid on
the part about you

16:54.719 --> 16:56.397
abandoning me and my mom.

16:56.508 --> 16:58.876
If anyone knew
I was alive,

16:58.977 --> 17:00.778
they would have
come for you to get to me,

17:00.879 --> 17:02.080
you and your mother.

17:02.114 --> 17:04.214
My mother's dead.

17:04.282 --> 17:07.585
Yes, I know.

17:07.618 --> 17:09.587
And I'm sorry.

17:12.790 --> 17:15.025
I loved your mother.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.194
So did I.

17:20.597 --> 17:23.633
And I'm sure she was
very proud of you.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.703
What, are you just,
like, saying that

17:26.804 --> 17:29.606
to make up for
all the school plays

17:29.608 --> 17:31.041
and the piano recitals
that you missed?

17:31.109 --> 17:32.910
Because I didn't do
any of those,

17:33.011 --> 17:34.512
if that makes you feel
any better.

17:34.546 --> 17:36.314
I'm saying that
because I knew your mother

17:36.415 --> 17:37.649
as well as anyone.

17:39.415 --> 17:40.915
And you were exactly
the daughter

17:40.921 --> 17:43.022
that we always dreamed of.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.961
Cassie,

17:49.029 --> 17:51.465
you have to give me
the medallion.

17:54.835 --> 17:56.336
What?

17:56.370 --> 17:57.738
As long as you have it,

17:57.839 --> 17:59.340
the spirits it contained
will come after you.

17:59.441 --> 18:02.543
You give me the medallion,
I will disappear.

18:04.279 --> 18:06.580
Forever.

18:06.648 --> 18:08.048
Adam was right.

18:08.083 --> 18:11.452
You only came here for--

18:11.553 --> 18:13.254
for something
other than me.

18:13.355 --> 18:14.789
You told him
you saw me?

18:14.856 --> 18:16.190
Yes.

18:16.258 --> 18:19.160
You shouldn't
have done that, Cassie.

18:19.194 --> 18:20.961
Well, I did.
I did,

18:20.995 --> 18:23.397
because Adam is someone
who I actually trust.

18:23.465 --> 18:26.199
I'm not giving you
that medallion,

18:26.267 --> 18:27.768
and I don't need
your protection.

18:27.869 --> 18:32.573
I've done fine without it
for the last 16 years.

19:11.597 --> 19:13.599
Tie her to the chair...

19:15.902 --> 19:18.303
And prepare
for the ceremony.

19:40.626 --> 19:42.160
Glad you came?

19:42.228 --> 19:43.540
I guess.

19:43.565 --> 19:47.564
So, you're obsessed
with voodoo.

19:48.067 --> 19:51.069
Do, uh, girls usually
like that?

19:51.137 --> 19:52.971
It's kind of
a hobby.

19:53.039 --> 19:56.842
Want a little
devil's spirit?

19:56.943 --> 19:59.044
Take the edge
off your judgmentalness?

20:00.647 --> 20:02.347
I didn't come for that.

20:02.449 --> 20:05.450
What did you
come for?

20:06.385 --> 20:09.855
I'll let you know
when I see it.

20:12.091 --> 20:14.192
How about...

20:14.260 --> 20:17.362
Something
completely different?

20:17.463 --> 20:19.998
Yeah. Ugly dolls
and fake blood

20:20.066 --> 20:22.300
is so Lee.

20:22.368 --> 20:25.204
Lee's a scammer.

20:25.272 --> 20:27.973
This is real voodoo.
Have a little faith.

20:32.112 --> 20:35.582
Concentrate
on your totem.

20:35.616 --> 20:37.383
I'll do
all the work.

20:39.487 --> 20:41.721
Ok.

20:55.303 --> 20:56.602
Oh, my God.

20:56.637 --> 21:00.006
Oh. God. I felt it,

21:00.040 --> 21:01.507
like a surge.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.543
Told you.
Feel good?

21:03.610 --> 21:06.012
- Yeah.
- Let's do it again.

21:06.046 --> 21:08.214
All right.
My turn. Switch totems.

21:08.249 --> 21:12.919
Um, I don't know.
Maybe not...

21:13.020 --> 21:15.621
Relax.
All right?

21:16.523 --> 21:18.324
Don't be
selfish, now.

21:25.265 --> 21:26.465
All right.
Let's just split up,

21:26.533 --> 21:27.567
find your friend,
and get out of here.

21:27.634 --> 21:28.634
Do not leave this room.
Got it?

21:28.735 --> 21:30.670
Yes, sir.

21:32.072 --> 21:34.340
He's very protective
of you.

21:34.441 --> 21:35.475
It's so sweet.

21:35.542 --> 21:37.176
Please.

21:40.047 --> 21:42.281
Feel it heat up,

21:42.349 --> 21:44.550
slap your palms.

21:52.892 --> 21:55.094
Did you feel it?

21:57.563 --> 21:59.798
I sure did.

21:59.866 --> 22:01.366
Is something wrong?

22:01.467 --> 22:03.868
Not at all.
In fact...

22:07.773 --> 22:10.709
Let me show you
something really amazing.

22:32.232 --> 22:35.334
Cassie? Cassie!

22:35.402 --> 22:38.137
Cassie?

22:39.506 --> 22:41.640
Who the hell are you?

22:45.612 --> 22:47.946
Why were you yelling for Cassie?
Did something happen to her?

22:48.014 --> 22:49.948
Why would I tell you
anything?

22:50.950 --> 22:53.419
I'm her father.

22:57.424 --> 22:59.225
You're supposed
to be dead.

22:59.326 --> 23:01.127
I asked you
a question.

23:01.161 --> 23:03.029
Is something wrong?

23:03.130 --> 23:06.531
We found salt ash
around her house.

23:06.633 --> 23:08.433
Hunters.
And I can't find her.

23:08.535 --> 23:11.370
She's not home, and she's not
answering her phone.

23:11.437 --> 23:13.238
Where else could she be?
I don't know

23:13.339 --> 23:16.141
with Adam Conant, maybe,

23:18.578 --> 23:33.657
at the boathouse.

23:51.780 --> 23:53.681
Eben?

23:57.886 --> 24:00.487
You were expecting
Isaac?

24:01.790 --> 24:03.424
He already failed
twice here.

24:03.492 --> 24:05.516
He has a soft spot for
you that seems to be

24:05.541 --> 24:06.741
getting in the way.

24:07.496 --> 24:09.497
And I have to be sure
that this task...

24:09.598 --> 24:12.533
Gets done.

24:12.601 --> 24:14.502
You came for Cassie.

24:14.536 --> 24:17.705
Yes.

24:17.740 --> 24:19.407
To trade for her life.

24:19.441 --> 24:22.409
A witch with
her dark magic?

24:22.444 --> 24:25.111
What could you give me more
valuable than that?

24:25.213 --> 24:27.714
John Blackwell.

24:29.116 --> 24:30.216
Blackwell.

24:30.250 --> 24:32.118
Yes.

24:32.152 --> 24:33.719
He's alive.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.321
You have proof?

24:35.422 --> 24:36.823
I just talked to him.

24:36.924 --> 24:41.024
Agree to let Cassie go,
I'll bring Blackwell to you.

25:08.035 --> 25:12.371
Your power is of
no help to you here.

25:12.438 --> 25:16.041
Not with colocasia
powder surrounding you.

25:17.343 --> 25:19.577
That's what you used
against my father.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.245
Yes.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.381
And luckily for me,

25:24.449 --> 25:29.153
you destroyed the medallion he
used to overcome it.

25:30.990 --> 25:33.158
So why aren't I dead?

25:33.259 --> 25:34.693
My plans changed
when I heard about

25:34.761 --> 25:38.064
your father's miraculous
resurrection.

25:41.268 --> 25:45.271
He and I go back
a long way.

25:45.372 --> 25:48.073
I didn't expect
to see him again.

25:48.108 --> 25:50.675
You're afraid of him.

25:50.776 --> 25:52.577
One must be careful

25:52.678 --> 25:57.781
when going against
such a stronger adversary.

26:00.218 --> 26:01.885
What re you doing?

26:03.888 --> 26:06.022
Being
extremely careful.

26:08.693 --> 26:18.635
Supnous tiemlo.

26:21.105 --> 26:23.006
Adam?

26:23.040 --> 26:24.908
I need to find Cassie.

26:25.009 --> 26:26.844
You're Cassie's father.

26:26.911 --> 26:28.712
Yes.

26:31.716 --> 26:33.951
What the hell?

26:34.019 --> 26:37.622
Adam,
go into the office.

26:39.458 --> 26:41.960
You shouldn't be here.

26:44.630 --> 26:47.065
It's not possible.

26:47.132 --> 26:48.733
Hello, Ethan.

26:48.834 --> 26:50.834
Stay away
from my son.

26:50.869 --> 26:54.071
He's looking
for Cassie.

26:54.138 --> 26:56.239
Amelia wouldn't want
you anywhere near her.

26:56.273 --> 26:58.341
Amelia would want
her safe.

26:58.375 --> 27:00.576
And I didn't come here
to make trouble.

27:00.644 --> 27:02.545
But I do need
to find Cassie.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.147
No. What you need to do

27:05.248 --> 27:07.149
is get the hell out
of Chance Harbor.

27:07.251 --> 27:11.554
Clearly, we have
some unfinished business, Ethan.

27:11.589 --> 27:14.057
Right now, I need
to find my daughter.

27:20.565 --> 27:22.366
Stay away from him.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.701
Believe me
when I tell you

27:24.769 --> 27:27.904
he is the last person
you ever want to know--

27:27.972 --> 27:29.905
you or Cassie.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.600
I found out
where Cassie is.

27:57.634 --> 27:59.703
Where?

27:59.804 --> 28:02.139
The witch hunters
have her.

28:12.116 --> 28:16.552
Diana?
I need your help.

28:25.863 --> 28:28.264
Kind of creepy,
Callum.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.234
Maid's day off.

28:36.074 --> 28:38.676
So, what did you
want to show me?

28:38.744 --> 28:41.379
What are you?

28:42.348 --> 28:44.282
I don't--
I don't understand.

28:44.350 --> 28:46.009
When we transferred
power back, I got a huge,

28:46.034 --> 28:47.234
charge off you.

28:47.553 --> 28:50.655
Way more than
what I gave you.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.058
You're a witch.

28:53.159 --> 28:54.459
You're high.

28:54.560 --> 28:57.362
I'm right, aren't I?

28:58.764 --> 29:00.365
Whoa.

29:05.870 --> 29:09.608
If I have as much power
as you think I do,

29:09.675 --> 29:13.579
do you really want
to test it?

29:27.194 --> 29:29.128
I've been looking for you.
Where's Callum?

29:29.195 --> 29:30.796
That jerk locked me
in a room.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.631
He knows I'm a witch.
Let's go.

29:32.699 --> 29:33.999
We have to find
Diana and Lee.

29:34.034 --> 29:37.837
Lee is the same.
He's using you.

29:37.904 --> 29:39.638
No.

29:39.706 --> 29:41.407
Lee came here
to help us.

29:41.509 --> 29:44.010
Callum has a totem just like
the one Lee gave you.

29:44.045 --> 29:46.012
He showed me
how it works.

29:46.047 --> 29:49.049
It doesn't give energy.
It takes it.

29:49.116 --> 29:50.917
Are you sure?

29:51.018 --> 29:52.619
I felt it.

29:54.155 --> 29:57.024
Adam called.
Cassie's in trouble.

29:57.058 --> 29:58.125
You found Melissa.

29:58.227 --> 29:59.761
And now we're leaving
without you.

29:59.828 --> 30:01.028
What's wrong?

30:01.130 --> 30:03.364
Melissa told me
about your totem scam.

30:03.432 --> 30:04.732
Screw you.

30:04.767 --> 30:07.168
Where'd she hear that?
Callum?

30:07.235 --> 30:09.736
The totem doesn't
mean anything.

30:09.837 --> 30:11.137
It's just an object.

30:11.238 --> 30:12.772
It's the spell
that matters.

30:12.840 --> 30:16.843
I can't believe
I trusted you.

30:26.353 --> 30:27.853
Where is she?

30:27.888 --> 30:29.556
I don't know.

30:29.590 --> 30:31.958
This is where the hunters
were taking her.

30:31.992 --> 30:34.794
How would you
know something like that?

30:34.862 --> 30:38.197
I have history
with them.

30:46.707 --> 30:49.876
You try any of your magic,
and I'll kill her.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.578
You're making
a serious mistake.

30:51.679 --> 30:53.480
Bold talk coming
from a dead man.

30:53.515 --> 30:55.082
Time to
let her go.

30:55.116 --> 30:56.717
We had a deal.

30:56.785 --> 30:58.286
The terms of
the deal have changed.

30:58.320 --> 31:00.188
Blackwell
gets Cassie.

31:00.223 --> 31:02.391
And I get you, Jake.

31:02.492 --> 31:06.394
We have accounts
to settle.

31:06.495 --> 31:08.196
I'll give you
your daughter unharmed.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.898
And then,
I'll walk away.

31:12.734 --> 31:15.502
Jake?

31:17.405 --> 31:20.539
Fine.
Let her go.

31:31.219 --> 31:33.420
Go to your father.

31:44.834 --> 31:46.034
Let's go.

31:46.135 --> 31:47.235
What about
Jake?

31:47.337 --> 31:48.636
He'll be ok.

31:48.671 --> 31:50.439
We just need to get
you away from here.

31:52.041 --> 31:55.043
What the hell, Ben?

31:57.547 --> 32:00.248
The iron will keep
your power in check.

32:04.687 --> 32:07.156
What happened to
killing Blackwell?

32:07.190 --> 32:09.392
I don't have to.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.661
Cassie will.

32:19.173 --> 32:20.870
Lee.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.634
Since when do you leave
a party before it's over?

32:22.776 --> 32:24.477
When it's
a lame party.

32:24.545 --> 32:27.780
Oh. Not as lame as
hiding secrets from your friends.

32:27.848 --> 32:29.481
Whatever.

32:29.549 --> 32:31.683
You know,
I thought it was strange

32:31.751 --> 32:33.485
how you moved on
from Eva so fast.

32:33.553 --> 32:34.953
You loved her.

32:35.054 --> 32:36.655
It'd take more than
a tight ass and a smile

32:36.689 --> 32:37.956
to get you
to forget about her.

32:37.990 --> 32:40.592
What's your point?
My point is,

32:40.659 --> 32:42.794
there's more to Faye and
her friends than I thought.

32:43.863 --> 32:45.264
They're witches.

32:45.298 --> 32:47.266
Melissa's power,

32:47.301 --> 32:50.870
that's big magic
for a small girl.

32:50.904 --> 32:52.706
Faye's is
off the charts.

32:54.275 --> 32:55.776
Go near Faye
and her friends,

32:55.810 --> 32:57.278
and I promise
you'll regret it.

32:59.314 --> 33:00.982
She got to you.

33:01.083 --> 33:03.818
Don't you kid
yourself, Lee.

33:03.886 --> 33:05.186
I know you're using her
for something.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.888
It's what you do.
It's what we both do.

33:18.332 --> 33:20.133
The road's
just over there.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.602
We got to hurry.
They'll come after us.

33:24.004 --> 33:26.806
Cassie?
What are you doing?

33:28.109 --> 33:30.411
What's that?
I don't know.

33:30.445 --> 33:31.412
Why are you doing that?

33:31.513 --> 33:33.414
I have no idea.
Cassie?

33:33.515 --> 33:35.049
What's going on?
I don't know.

33:35.118 --> 33:36.918
Put the branch down!

33:45.227 --> 33:46.728
Why is this happening?

33:46.762 --> 33:48.663
You've been spelled
with Linden.

33:48.731 --> 33:49.865
It's
a hypnotic root.

33:49.932 --> 33:51.433
Use your magic!
Stop me, please!

33:51.467 --> 33:52.634
I can't.

33:52.735 --> 33:53.869
I don't have
magic anymore.

33:53.937 --> 33:55.136
Fight it, Cassie.

33:55.237 --> 33:57.238
I'm trying.
I can't!

33:57.273 --> 33:58.640
You're stronger
than you think.

33:58.674 --> 34:00.141
Push me down!
Knock me over!

34:00.176 --> 34:01.276
Do something!

34:01.343 --> 34:03.644
No! I won't hurt you.

34:20.395 --> 34:21.495
What are you doing?

34:21.563 --> 34:23.297
Your usefulness
has come to an end.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.966
I brought you Blackwell!
We had a deal!

34:27.768 --> 34:29.469
Your father said
nearly the same thing

34:29.570 --> 34:31.871
just before
I slit his throat.

34:44.185 --> 34:45.385
Oh, my God.

34:50.092 --> 34:52.226
You're welcome. You do that?

34:56.099 --> 34:58.400
Can I get
a little help?

34:59.703 --> 35:01.737
Lock unlock.

35:03.740 --> 35:08.110
Lock unlock.

35:08.211 --> 35:09.645
Are you ok?

35:09.712 --> 35:13.648
Yeah. Thanks.

35:13.716 --> 35:15.116
What the hell?

35:15.588 --> 35:17.452
That's impossible.
He had branch through his gun.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.020
How'd he get up
and run away?

35:20.121 --> 35:22.523
I don't know, but right now,
we need to find Cassie.

35:27.062 --> 35:29.530
Cassie,
fight the spell.

35:29.632 --> 35:31.333
I'm trying.
I can't.

35:31.367 --> 35:33.068
Cassie!

35:33.136 --> 35:35.471
I've been spelled.
I can't stop!

35:35.539 --> 35:36.672
We have to break
the connection

35:36.740 --> 35:37.974
between Cassie
and the spell.

35:38.041 --> 35:39.342
Follow my lead.

35:39.444 --> 35:41.978
By our power,
restore her will.

35:42.046 --> 35:45.281
By our power,
restore her will...

35:46.850 --> 35:49.252
The spell's not working.
We need the whole circle.

35:49.286 --> 35:50.453
Cassie,
you have to help.

35:50.554 --> 35:51.788
Focus on the words
as hard as you can.

35:51.856 --> 35:53.856
I can't!
Forget what your body is doing.

35:53.957 --> 35:55.391
Just concentrate
on the spell.

35:56.416 --> 35:57.682
By our power...

35:57.716 --> 35:59.384
Restore
her will...Spell.

35:59.418 --> 36:01.919
By our power,
restore her will.

36:01.987 --> 36:04.388
By our power,
restore her will.

36:04.490 --> 36:07.492
By our power,
restore her will.

36:36.906 --> 36:40.742
So, isn't Cassie's father
supposed to be really, really evil?

36:40.809 --> 36:42.510
We don't know
that for sure.

36:42.611 --> 36:45.412
He didn't hurt Cassie, even when
she was coming after him.

36:45.446 --> 36:48.215
I just hope we did
the right thing, saving him.

36:48.249 --> 36:52.419
'Cause when my dad looked at
Blackwell tonight,

36:52.521 --> 36:55.423
I've never seen him
so scared.

36:57.226 --> 37:01.564
I can't believe
I almost killed you.

37:01.631 --> 37:04.066
If the circle hadn't
been their to help-

37:04.168 --> 37:06.369
They weren't there
for me, Cassie.

37:06.437 --> 37:09.439
They came
to help you.

37:10.842 --> 37:13.776
How did you lose
your magic?

37:16.447 --> 37:18.548
After the fire,

37:18.583 --> 37:20.313
the elders stripped
your mother's generation

37:20.338 --> 37:22.079
of its powers.

37:23.253 --> 37:25.087
Somehow,
it affected me

37:25.155 --> 37:28.390
and honestly,

37:28.458 --> 37:31.059
I wish they'd had taken it
a long time ago.

37:33.362 --> 37:35.672
'Cause dark magic
took everything

37:35.697 --> 37:36.897
I ever cared about--

37:36.966 --> 37:41.571
you, your mother.

37:41.605 --> 37:43.707
So,
what will happen now?

37:43.774 --> 37:47.477
I don't know.

37:47.578 --> 37:50.280
No one will ever believe
that I've changed.

37:50.315 --> 37:54.885
Cassie, I am not
the man I used to be.

37:54.986 --> 37:57.687
And all I care about is
keeping you safe.

37:59.423 --> 38:01.825
I can't give you
the medallion.

38:01.893 --> 38:04.194
You still don't
trust me?

38:04.229 --> 38:06.997
I can't give you the medallion
because it's gone.

38:07.032 --> 38:08.799
I destroyed it.

38:10.902 --> 38:14.038
So, there's no reason for
you to stay.

38:14.106 --> 38:18.042
No. No,there's every reason.

38:18.110 --> 38:20.244
You can't
protect yourself.

38:20.312 --> 38:24.249
Yeah

38:24.317 --> 38:27.653
Eben spelled me.

38:27.721 --> 38:29.454
How?

38:29.522 --> 38:31.223
When regular people
do that kind of thing,

38:31.257 --> 38:32.624
they're called witches.

38:32.725 --> 38:34.125
Eben and I go
a long way back,

38:34.127 --> 38:36.324
and I can assure you
that he is not a witch.

38:36.325 --> 38:39.328
Well, then he's working with one
like he worked with Jake.

38:40.033 --> 38:41.767
What other explanation
is there?

38:41.835 --> 38:45.238
I don't know.

38:45.272 --> 38:46.707
But until I find out,

38:46.732 --> 38:48.699
I'm staying right here
in Chance Harbor.

38:51.845 --> 38:54.546
Good night.

38:59.352 --> 39:01.353
What the hell?

39:02.674 --> 39:03.645
I came in
through the window.

39:03.726 --> 39:05.593
And now, you can go back
out the window.

39:05.618 --> 39:07.118
Faye, listen to me.

39:09.896 --> 39:11.864
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

39:11.965 --> 39:14.467
Touching.
Heartfelt.

39:14.568 --> 39:17.670
Nothing says "I care" like
a power-sucking totem.

39:17.704 --> 39:19.271
Give it to me.
What?

39:19.306 --> 39:20.473
Give me the totem.

39:32.386 --> 39:35.087
If you have any doubts
about this,

39:35.188 --> 39:38.490
we'll just find you another
way to get you power.

39:40.393 --> 39:42.394
Ok?

40:34.344 --> 40:37.080
You set me up today.

40:37.148 --> 40:38.649
Eben would have killed
Cassie.

40:38.750 --> 40:41.151
It was the only way
to stop him.

40:45.857 --> 40:47.492
Thank you.

40:47.559 --> 40:50.295
You saved
my daughter's life.

40:50.363 --> 40:52.097
You obviously care
for her.

40:52.164 --> 40:54.365
I do.

40:54.399 --> 40:59.403
Then you and I should work
together to keep her safe,

40:59.471 --> 41:02.673
because tonight was
only the beginning.
