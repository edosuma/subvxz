WEBVTT

01:35.512 --> 01:36.512
And prlling.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.942
Stand by, camera one.

01:50.027 --> 01:52.945
In three, two...

01:53.030 --> 01:54.697
Good evening. I'm Will McAvoy.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.324
This is Monday, August 8th.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.785
And this past Friday, for the first time ever,

01:58.869 --> 02:02.121
Standard and Poor's downgraded
the credit rating of the US Treasury.

02:02.206 --> 02:04.665
You would think that would be
tonight's top story,

02:04.750 --> 02:06.959
or you might think that it would be the Dow

02:07.044 --> 02:11.130
closing 634 points down
on its worst day of trading in three years,

02:11.215 --> 02:13.216
or the austerity riots in Europe

02:13.300 --> 02:16.928
or any of the statements made today by
the Republican candidates for president

02:17.012 --> 02:19.639
or statements made by the president himself,

02:19.723 --> 02:21.432
but it's not.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.727
Tonight's top story
is a woman named Dorothy Cooper.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.026
Will?

02:34.446 --> 02:35.988
Will, it's MacKenzie.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.824
I saw him come in, but I didn't see him leave.

02:37.908 --> 02:40.743
- I've been on for six hours.
- Will?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.499
Will?

02:46.583 --> 02:48.584
Hello?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.847
He's not here.

03:01.265 --> 03:02.974
Will?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.770
- Did you try calling his...
- Hold on.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.335
- Billy! Billy!
- Oh, Jesus.

03:33.422 --> 03:36.215
I need an ambulance right away.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.762
He's out of immediate danger,

03:41.847 --> 03:43.639
but we're going to have
to stop the internal bleeding.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.474
What happened?
Why was he coughing up blood?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.102
He wasn't coughing up blood.
He was vomiting blood from his stomach.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.271
There's upper GI bleeding,
probably a perforation.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.981
You're describing a bleeding ulcer.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.691
Yes. We're prepping him for an EGD.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.234
I don't know what that is.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.278
They're gonna put a tube with a camera
down his throat.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.988
Does he take any pain medication?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.115
Hardly ever. It's called...

04:01.199 --> 04:02.825
- Naproxen.
- Okay.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.912
He hurt himself playing baseball in
high school, his elbow and his knees.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.289
- Right elbow and his left knee.
- What about antidepressants?

04:08.373 --> 04:09.957
- No.
- Yes.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.335
He takes 135 milligrams a day of Effexor.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.128
Since when?

04:14.212 --> 04:16.631
- I gotta keep some confidentiality.
- No, not anymore.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.257
When did he start taking antidepressants?

04:18.342 --> 04:21.093
Has he been particularly depressed
about anything recently?

04:21.178 --> 04:22.595
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:22.679 --> 04:26.349
A magazine article, a hatchet job that mocked
everything we've been...

04:26.808 --> 04:29.226
It was humiliating
and he's taken it very personally.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.520
Okay, I think he's been self-medicating.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.397
One of the possible side-effects of Naproxen

04:33.482 --> 04:34.899
is a decrease in the prostaglandin,

04:35.025 --> 04:36.776
which protects the stomach lining
from its own acid.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.569
And he knows that.
That's why he hardly ever takes it.

04:38.654 --> 04:39.946
Why would he suddenly take so much?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.822
To get rid of the migraine headache
that comes with taking

04:41.907 --> 04:45.034
too much Effexor and bourbon
at the same time.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.911
He took too many antidepressants?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.497
I can't say for sure, but...

04:49.581 --> 04:51.415
Yeah, I can say for sure.

04:52.084 --> 04:54.543
We'll be keeping him here for a little while.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.092
Dorothy Cooper is a 96-year-old resident
of Chattanooga, Tennessee,

05:01.176 --> 05:03.803
and has been voting for the last 75 years.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.347
This year, she's been told she can't.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.975
A new law in Tennessee
requires residents to show

05:09.059 --> 05:12.395
a government-issued photo ID
in order to vote.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.605
Dorothy Cooper doesn't have
a driver's license

05:14.690 --> 05:16.649
because Dorothy Cooper doesn't have a car.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.485
Dorothy Cooper doesn't have a passport.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.737
A vacation abroad was never in her future.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.240
Tennessee isn't alone.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.826
At this moment, 33 states have proposed

05:26.910 --> 05:29.912
or already adopted the same voter ID laws

05:29.997 --> 05:31.747
that have disqualified Dorothy Cooper

05:31.832 --> 05:34.792
from the one fundamental thing
that we all do as Americans.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.338
It's estimated that 11%,
or roughly 20 million people,

05:39.423 --> 05:41.674
don't have government-issued voter IDs

05:41.758 --> 05:44.427
and will be disenfranchised this November.
Why?

05:44.553 --> 05:47.096
To crack down on the terrible
problem of voter fraud.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.724
- Roll five.
- Governor Rick Perry of Texas,

05:49.933 --> 05:52.184
who is about to enter
the presidential primary race,

05:52.269 --> 05:54.103
is serious about cracking down
on the problem.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.439
Making sure that there's not fraud,

05:56.523 --> 06:00.901
making sure that
someone's not manipulating that process

06:01.111 --> 06:03.863
makes all the sense in the world to me.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.407
To me, too, because voter fraud
is such a huge problem

06:06.491 --> 06:08.951
that during a five-year period
under the Bush Administration,

06:09.036 --> 06:11.287
when 196 million votes were cast,

06:11.580 --> 06:16.000
the number of cases
of voter fraud reached 86.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.628
Not 86,000. Eighty-six.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.257
Here's what that number
looks like as a percentage of votes cast.

06:23.467 --> 06:25.926
Four 100,000ths of a percent.

06:26.386 --> 06:29.346
This would be called
a solution without a problem, but it's not.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.475
It's just a solution to a different problem.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.561
Republicans have a hard time
getting certain people to vote for them,

06:35.645 --> 06:39.148
so life would be a lot easier if certain people
just weren't allowed to vote at all.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.611
I'm ashamed to say that
32 of the 33 voter ID laws

06:43.695 --> 06:45.488
were proposed by Republican legislators

06:45.572 --> 06:48.324
and passed by Republican-controlled
state houses

06:48.492 --> 06:50.868
and signed into law
by Republican governors.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.580
I am not, however, ashamed to say
that I am a Republican.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.249
And that brings us to tonight's second story.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.215
Austerity riots in London
and the FAA shutdown.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.218
Mitch McConnell said
the debt deal was a "hostage worth taking."

07:07.344 --> 07:09.095
- That's a quote?
- We're checking.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.930
As of about 10 minutes ago,
the Dow's down below 12,000.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.224
There's a new investigation into why
the Interior Department

07:13.308 --> 07:15.101
hasn't collected billions in oil royalties.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.894
Robert Bork is now a Romney advisor.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.104
We'll get this all sorted out.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.690
But let me ask, is anybody here an expert
on Sex and the City?

07:22.025 --> 07:24.360
The TV show or just... The TV show.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.029
- Mother of Moses.
- Listen, she goes out of her way

07:27.114 --> 07:29.115
to take an interest in my interests
and I wanna do the same.

07:29.199 --> 07:31.117
- And she loves...
- I know what she loves.

07:31.201 --> 07:33.702
- I need a crash course.
- They have tours.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.080
- What do you mean?
- They have Sex and the City tours.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.457
Open-air buses that drive around
the West Village

07:38.542 --> 07:41.544
and go to all the locations
and shoe stores in the show.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.964
The buses are filled with women who know
every line from every episode.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.632
- It's three hours.
- Three hours?

07:46.716 --> 07:49.301
If you really wanna make Lisa happy,
you'll go to Sex and the City school

07:49.386 --> 07:51.137
and take the tour.

07:51.513 --> 07:52.888
I don't know if I wanna make her that happy.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.225
Let's start with McConnell
and the hostage worth taking.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.823
You were sleeping for a while.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.742
Yeah.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.580
That's good. You need to rest.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.206
Yeah.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.552
- Why did you do this?
- Hey!

08:31.636 --> 08:33.846
- What is wrong with you?
- Stop hitting me!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.682
- I've been waiting two days to hit you.
- I appreciate your patience.

08:36.766 --> 08:39.768
I don't want your wise-ass remarks.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.654
You have to stop being so sad about this.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.406
I'm not sad about it. I'm over it.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.618
Uh-huh. That's why you suddenly
took antidepressants.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.578
You got bad press.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.080
It's not the first time.
It's not even the thousandth.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.041
- Did you bring Jane up from Washington?
- Yes.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.418
- You should go back and work.
- Jim's got it for a few hours.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.086
- Tell me how this...
- Jane needs you.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.380
Jim's got it. Why is this story different from...

09:08.465 --> 09:11.008
- It just is.
- That's a child's answer.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.177
- Did you read it?
- Of course I read it.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.346
It was a hatchet job from my
idiot ex-boyfriend.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.722
You've gotten them before.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.724
You've gotten them from him before.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.768
It isn't worth the weeks you've spent...

09:20.852 --> 09:23.812
It's almost, it's two weeks
you've been sliding...

09:23.897 --> 09:25.439
- "The Greater Fool."
- I read it.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.734
"One CNN producer remarked,
'It's as though McAvoy is unaware

09:28.818 --> 09:31.403
"'of how ridiculous he looks
doing what he thinks passes

09:31.488 --> 09:33.739
- "'as a Murrow impersonation."'
- Will, I know what it says.

09:33.823 --> 09:37.576
"A senior VP
at parent company AWM laughed as he said,

09:37.661 --> 09:40.079
"'Will wants to change the world
and hates that the world has changed."'

09:40.247 --> 09:42.706
- You know it by heart.
- "It's not so much Will McAvoy is old..."

09:42.791 --> 09:45.459
- Okay, this is really weird.
- "...it's that he is antiquated.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.254
"His premise is irrelevant and pompous."

09:48.338 --> 09:50.089
- And why do you care this much?
- The greater fool.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.758
- Why do you care this much?
- Because they're right!

09:52.842 --> 09:54.134
Easy. And, no, they're not.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.096
- They're right. He's right.
- Being a cynic is easy.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.430
- What's difficult...
- Reality isn't.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.516
Trust me, this piece
was right about everything.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.935
Stop. Enough. It's been two weeks.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.437
- Get up off the damn mat.
- You wanted Don Quixote?

10:05.522 --> 10:06.772
This is it.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.191
By the way, this is what brought him down.

10:09.276 --> 10:11.735
- Nobody's brought you down.
- The Knight of the Mirrors.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.362
He holds up the mirror and shows him.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.655
- Stop it.
- Shows him!

10:14.739 --> 10:16.073
I mean, he doesn't fight him with a sword.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.741
He shows him with a mirror

10:17.826 --> 10:19.785
what a total fool he looks like.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.871
Brian was the Knight of the Mirrors,
and that's the chapter we're up to.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.999
Nobody's brought you down.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.960
You'll get back in your chair,
the red light will go on,

10:28.044 --> 10:29.628
and you'll go to that place
you go every time...

10:29.713 --> 10:31.547
I don't think I'm coming back.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.015
I don't think I am.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.857
You're coming back if I have to chop you up,
put you in a duffel bag,

10:49.941 --> 10:51.525
and reassemble you at the anchor desk.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.242
- You should answer that.
- You're coming back.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.827
Could be the office.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.302
This is MacKenzie.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.722
Why did you want to meet me?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.891
I have a story I don't wanna write.

11:23.975 --> 11:25.017
Then don't write it.

11:25.101 --> 11:28.312
I have one source,
and if I get a second one, I'll have to.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.022
What is it?

11:30.106 --> 11:33.776
The night of May 1 st,
the night we got bin Laden,

11:35.111 --> 11:37.404
was Will high on the air?

11:38.406 --> 11:42.618
- Was he high...
- Was he high on the air?

11:42.952 --> 11:45.287
- Who the hell told you that?
- My first source.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.997
- You got lied to.
- I didn't.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.082
Nina, you got lied to.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.001
No. I promise, it's an unimpeachable source.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.711
And if I get a second one...

11:52.796 --> 11:54.171
Damn it, Nina, this is a complete lie.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.799
No, listen to me. I'm trying to help you.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.260
- How?
- By telling you.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.263
If I find a second source,
I have to go to press right away.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.391
- And you're giving me a heads-up?
- Yeah.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.559
Why?

12:07.644 --> 12:09.645
Because I am.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.652
You can understand my reluctance
to trust you.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.238
I understand everyone's
reluctance to trust me.

12:19.322 --> 12:21.824
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I can't.

12:24.953 --> 12:28.914
I don't like some of the things that I've
done to Will and to you.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.209
I don't like some of the things
I've done to a lot of people.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.504
Sorry, I don't believe you, Nina.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.800
When you were little,
what did you wanna do when you grew up?

12:39.884 --> 12:41.802
Exactly what I'm doing.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.762
I wanted to do exactly what you're doing, too.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.431
There's no such thing as a little girl

12:45.515 --> 12:48.225
who dreams of being
a gossip columnist one day.

12:48.309 --> 12:50.102
I am trying to make some changes,

12:50.186 --> 12:52.020
but I'm caught in the middle of...

12:52.105 --> 12:54.314
You want me to feel sorry for you?

12:55.400 --> 12:58.819
No. No, I don't.

12:59.028 --> 13:02.030
Then what am I supposed to do with that?

13:02.532 --> 13:05.159
Make sure I don't find a second source.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.036
Keep walking. I'm gonna cross the street.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.124
- It's not true.
- Yes, it is.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.543
I'm sorry.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.754
Obviously he didn't know he was gonna have
to be on the air later that night.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.506
- He was high for bin Laden?
- Yeah.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.508
- But he killed it that night.
- I don't know what to tell you.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.760
- He's a savant.
- Who else knew?

13:23.845 --> 13:25.471
Neal, Neal's girlfriend Kaylee,

13:25.555 --> 13:28.348
- maybe some of the others...
- There's no way they went to Nina.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.727
- I already spoke to them.
- I don't even need to. There's no way.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.687
This is it, right?

13:34.606 --> 13:37.608
This is what Reese
and Leona will use to fire Will.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.901
Yeah.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.405
- So what are they waiting for?
- A second source.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.324
- Why?
- I'd need two sources.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.742
You're not TMI!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.369
I've never seen Will this down.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.288
He's talking about not coming back.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.416
He's coming back. Don't lose hope.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.753
- I gotta go meet a guy.
- Hancock?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.421
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna tell him?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.882
The truth.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.592
Why?

14:03.676 --> 14:05.344
You're not a credible witness.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.263
Thirty-five years at the NSA doesn't
make me a credible witness?

14:08.348 --> 14:10.599
Why did they downgrade your
security clearance?

14:10.683 --> 14:12.017
They didn't downgrade my security clearance.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.477
- They did.
- They didn't.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.229
I have reporters, Solomon.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.023
We have pages from your CSS file.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.983
He was given, the reporter,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.986
he was just given those pages, right?

14:23.238 --> 14:24.863
- He was just handed them?
- All he had to do was ask.

14:24.948 --> 14:26.865
- He was given them?
- Yes, he was.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.617
- Retaliation.
- Solomon...

14:28.743 --> 14:31.453
Retaliation for raising
the hue and cry about GLOBALCLARITY.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.497
Listen. Look at me. I respect you.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.457
I respect what you're trying to do.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.711
Nothing's harder than doing something
for which you know you're gonna take shit.

14:39.796 --> 14:40.796
Then why won't you just...

14:40.880 --> 14:44.925
Because if you're the face of the story,
you'll contaminate it.

14:55.228 --> 14:57.604
Do you like beef stew?

14:57.981 --> 14:59.648
- Beef stew?
- You like it?

14:59.899 --> 15:01.108
I guess. I don't know.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.193
- What are we talking about?
- I like it.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.320
I used to make it
for my kids on Sunday nights.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.031
Sunday was my night with the kids.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.326
Brown sugar and ketchup.

15:11.619 --> 15:14.162
You slow-cook it for eight hours,
that's the trick.

15:14.497 --> 15:15.998
The kids loved it.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.000
Solomon, it's shit like this
that makes me nervous.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.252
- Can I give you the name of a guy?
- A doctor?

15:20.336 --> 15:22.838
- Somebody to talk to.
- I come to you with a story,

15:22.922 --> 15:25.799
the NSA is illegally...
And you wanna send me to a doctor.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.134
I'm just being a friend.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.261
I don't have friends and I don't want friends.

15:32.682 --> 15:34.141
All right.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.269
TMI!

15:37.895 --> 15:40.272
You said you had proof they were hacking.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.940
Was that a lie?

15:42.025 --> 15:45.193
- Did you use that as bait so...
- I don't lie.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.238
I've paid for sex, yes.
I tried to see my wife, yes.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.948
I don't see what that has to do with anything.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.785
Okay, then let me say that
I've acted in good faith.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.330
- No. You didn't act at all.
- I've acted in good faith.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.332
I'll continue to pursue the NSA story
as hard as I can.

15:58.416 --> 16:02.961
No, no, we had a deal.
I see the NSA story on ACN,

16:03.129 --> 16:05.672
and then I hand over the TMI! Proof.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.633
- Hand it over now.
- So you can destroy it?

16:07.884 --> 16:12.721
No, so I can help out a friend
who's a lot like you.

16:13.014 --> 16:17.434
And he will, I promise you, not rest

16:18.436 --> 16:20.228
until he's reported the NSA story,

16:20.396 --> 16:22.064
assuming it's as solid as you say.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.732
- Then you won't need me at all.
- Solomon...

16:23.816 --> 16:27.069
If I give you the TMI! Proof,
you won't need me at all.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.237
Do you know how many years it's been

16:29.322 --> 16:31.823
since my kids have come over
for dinner on Sunday?

16:33.242 --> 16:34.910
No.

16:41.167 --> 16:45.087
Adding further to investors' jitters,
Wall Street is waiting for Friday's jobs report.

16:45.171 --> 16:46.171
But some optimists I've talked to

16:46.255 --> 16:50.550
expect the report to show
that the US created 75,000 jobs in July

16:50.635 --> 16:54.513
and the unemployment rate
may hold steady at 9.2%.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.432
For more on that,
ACN financial analyst Kelly Slade.

16:57.809 --> 16:59.476
You got a job offer?

16:59.560 --> 17:01.353
- Can you wait until we're alone?
- Are you considering it?

17:01.604 --> 17:04.898
- I was taken to lunch.
- Ah, it all starts with the lunch.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.610
Thanks, Kelly, we'll be coming back to you
for the Market Wrap-Up at 4:30.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.322
I'm Sloan Sabbith. Now back to
Robin Burnett and Best of Health.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.907
And we're clear.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.827
- An innocent lunch.
- That's what it was.

17:16.911 --> 17:18.286
- Where?
- The Ocean Club.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.705
- Why?
- I was hungry.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.623
- Hey.
- An ACN poll released two days ago

17:21.791 --> 17:23.250
has 42% of Americans

17:23.334 --> 17:25.419
believing that when we raise the debt ceiling,

17:25.503 --> 17:26.753
it means borrowing more money.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.547
- That's nothing new.
- I know that's nothing new!

17:28.631 --> 17:31.133
- In here.
- I know that's nothing new. That's my point.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.802
I've been talking about it almost
every night since the midterms,

17:33.886 --> 17:35.470
and I haven't moved the needle at all.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.639
Well, you're not gonna
move it in venture capital.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.725
- I'll get paid.
- You're just having one of those days.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.811
Will says he's not coming back.

17:44.355 --> 17:46.022
Ask a boxer who's just
been knocked unconscious

17:46.107 --> 17:49.067
when he'd like to schedule his next bout.

17:49.652 --> 17:50.986
Friday will be my last day.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.529
- You've made up your mind?
- Yeah.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.864
Then I have three days to change your mind.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.575
42% was exactly the same number
as before I started talking...

17:56.659 --> 17:57.909
Maybe it would've gone higher.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.245
Maybe you helped keep it at 42%.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.046
- I have to get ready for Wrap-Up.
- Okay.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.131
Wait.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.175
Nah, it's all right.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.427
- No, wait. No.
- Okay.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.345
- Yes, all right.
- This can only be about Maggie.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.680
I'm gonna ask her to move in with me.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.683
I see.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.230
First, let me say you made a very wise
decision coming to me with this problem.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.607
It's not a problem.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.609
Well, let's see what I can do about that.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.152
How would you want to be asked?

18:32.236 --> 18:33.570
- To move in with a guy?
- Yeah.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.322
By having the guy say, "Will you marry me?"

18:35.406 --> 18:37.741
Okay, well, let's just take that off the table
for the moment.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.285
You know, if you're living together,
it makes it harder to break up.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.871
- Well, that's the idea.
- You have to get cartons.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.247
You've been no help at all.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.125
Since I'm never going
to see you again after Friday,

18:47.210 --> 18:49.336
- I feel like I can tell you something.
- We'll see each other.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.671
- Maybe not after I say what I'm going to say.
- And you're not leaving.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.715
I don't know who told you you're a bad guy,

18:54.759 --> 18:56.635
but somebody did,

18:57.428 --> 18:58.804
somebody along the way.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.016
Somebody or something convinced you of it

19:03.100 --> 19:06.394
because you think you're a bad guy,
and you're just not.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.981
I'm socially inept, but even I know that.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.735
So because you're a bad guy,
you try to do things

19:13.820 --> 19:17.239
you think a good guy would do,

19:17.657 --> 19:21.159
like committing to someone you like
but maybe don't love.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.082
A sweet, smart, wholesome Midwestern girl.

19:30.545 --> 19:34.256
I could be wrong. I almost always am.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.012
Why are you single?

19:41.097 --> 19:42.764
A lot of men are intimidated
by my intelligence.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.683
No, seriously.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.728
Because you never asked me out.

19:51.774 --> 19:53.275
Caught you off-guard, didn't I?

19:55.778 --> 19:57.279
Yeah, you really did.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.951
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.787
Now I don't remember why.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.706
Don and Maggie are moving in together.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.250
- Yeah?
- I still have to ask her.

20:11.210 --> 20:15.046
Seriously? That's great! Cool.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.924
I didn't... All right.

20:18.301 --> 20:21.177
- Good luck. In your apartment?
- Mmm?

20:21.596 --> 20:23.889
You're moving in together
in your apartment?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.849
No, in fact, we're gonna live
among the hill people.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.350
I didn't know if you were gonna...

20:27.435 --> 20:28.560
We'll start at my apartment.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.686
Okay, so...

20:29.770 --> 20:32.063
I really don't remember why I asked you to
come in here, I'm sorry.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.398
Don't worry about it.

20:36.277 --> 20:37.944
I'll see you later.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.998
You're wrong.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.084
I do want to commit to Maggie.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.757
Well, that's what a good guy would do.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.496
Shit.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.585
I was just checking this. I'll fix it.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.214
Yeah, the nurse can get that back in there.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.927
Does it feel like something life-threatening
is happening right now?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.971
- What is it I'm wearing?
- I bought you some pajamas.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.639
- You like them?
- How did I get into them?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.933
The nurse changed you into them while
you were asleep.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.061
- What's wrong here?
- He knocked out one of his tubes.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.313
- Don't play with these.
- You really shouldn't.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.065
She changed my clothes?

21:57.400 --> 21:58.775
- Um, well...
- Hey.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.944
Hey! Look!

22:01.070 --> 22:03.905
- Jim's here.
- Yeah, I can see him, too.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.615
Tell us what's happening, Jim.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.993
The JPL says the Mars orbiter
may have found water.

22:08.077 --> 22:09.452
- Do you hear that?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:09.537 --> 22:10.870
- And where did they find the water?
- God.

22:11.038 --> 22:12.205
- On Mars.
- Cool.

22:12.373 --> 22:15.333
There was another lockdown at Virginia Tech,
but it was a false alarm.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.752
- Jim says there was another...
- I am right here.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.754
- How about office gossip?
- Office gossip?

22:19.880 --> 22:20.964
Yes.

22:21.215 --> 22:24.592
Maybe you can lift Will's spirits
with tales from the office.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.428
Why is she talking like this?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.347
Everything's pretty much the same.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.766
People miss you. They're worried about you.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.811
Don's asking Maggie to move in with him,

22:34.895 --> 22:38.314
which is great for Don and the world.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.025
They put Fresca in the vending machines.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.484
- What?
- The vending machines have Fresca.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.528
- Maggie's moving in with Don?
- He's asking her.

22:43.612 --> 22:45.572
- What about the speech I gave you?
- Which one?

22:45.656 --> 22:47.615
- What do you mean which one?
- You give a lot of...

22:47.742 --> 22:48.908
"Gather ye rosebuds," Jim!

22:48.993 --> 22:50.618
When I told you to gather ye rosebuds.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.954
- Did you?
- I did. Yes.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.873
- But...
- What?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.499
I accidentally gathered the wrong rosebuds.

22:56.625 --> 23:00.170
- What are you talking about?
- I took action, the very night.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.797
I went to Maggie's,
but before I had a chance to say anything,

23:02.923 --> 23:04.632
Lisa kissed me and we were out the door.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.052
- Why?
- Lisa thought I was there to see her.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.804
- Why?
- Classic case of

23:10.681 --> 23:11.890
that happening.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.391
- That was two months ago.
- Yeah.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.102
- And what's happened since?
- I've been dating Lisa.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.651
- Do you want to end up like me and him?
- No!

23:23.736 --> 23:25.945
Wasting time? And now he's practically dead.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.739
- I'm not practically dead.
- Eat some Jell-O.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.240
You've got to do something
before he asks her.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.575
- No.
- Why not?

23:30.659 --> 23:31.826
It doesn't seem like a very nice thing

23:31.911 --> 23:34.162
to do to Don or Maggie or Lisa.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.247
So you're willing to end up like the two of us.

23:36.582 --> 23:39.751
A strong, beautiful, vital woman

23:39.835 --> 23:41.628
and a hollowed-out shell of a man.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.839
- You know I'm awake now?
- That's a dead person speaking, basically.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.343
And now I'm gonna have to spend the next
God knows how many hours in mourning.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.886
- Please go back to work.
- He will.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.679
- I'm talking to you.
- I will.

23:54.850 --> 23:57.936
The piece was bullshit. Believe that.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.188
Feel better.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.611
Why was it so important to you?

24:06.695 --> 24:09.405
- I think I'm gonna sleep for a while.
- Why did you want the story?

24:09.532 --> 24:10.907
I didn't think it was gonna come out like this.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.368
Obviously, but why
did you want the story in the first place?

24:13.619 --> 24:16.704
- You'll say it's stupid.
- Why did you want the piece?

24:18.499 --> 24:19.791
At the end of Camelot...

24:19.875 --> 24:20.875
- God!
- See?

24:20.960 --> 24:22.961
What? What happens at the end of Camelot?

24:23.129 --> 24:24.754
England goes to war with France.

24:24.880 --> 24:27.799
But King Arthur finds a stowaway,
a young kid,

24:27.883 --> 24:30.718
and he orders the kid to run
from village to village,

24:30.803 --> 24:33.638
telling everyone about
Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table

24:33.722 --> 24:35.807
so that everyone will know it's possible.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.393
The magazine piece
was supposed to be my young kid.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.563
Do you have any life philosophy that
isn't based on a musical?

24:41.814 --> 24:45.441
Hey, Dulcinea, I wasn't the one who came in
a year ago talking about Don Quixote.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.235
It lit a fire under your ass.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.029
It lit my ass on fire.
That's not the same thing.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.365
You have to stop
telling people you're not coming back.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.491
You're scaring the hell out of them.

24:53.576 --> 24:55.493
- They need to be prepared.
- No, they don't.

24:55.578 --> 24:56.786
Everything's going to be fine.

24:56.871 --> 24:58.204
Everything's going to be great.

24:58.289 --> 25:00.248
- There's just one thing.
- What?

25:01.792 --> 25:05.712
Nina Howard has a source that knows you
were high during the bin Laden broadcast.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.005
She's waiting for a second source,

25:07.089 --> 25:08.631
and when she has it, it'll be published.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.843
And Reese and Leona will
fire you and your career will end in disgrace.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.929
Well, the good news is I'm already disgraced.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.140
I'm pre-disgraced, so I'm disgrace-proof.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.350
- Who do you think her source is?
- I don't know. I don't care.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.519
- I like Jell-O.
- Snap out of it!

25:21.604 --> 25:23.938
- Can I have the mean nurse back?
- Yes.

25:35.409 --> 25:38.536
- Yeah?
- I've got some very bad news.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.205
I'm kind of maxed out on bad news.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.956
Can it wait?

25:43.334 --> 25:44.709
Last night, a man rode his bicycle

25:44.793 --> 25:47.086
to the middle of the Queensboro Bridge
and jumped off.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.048
They've just identified the body as...

25:50.174 --> 25:51.299
No.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.929
...Solomon Hancock.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.389
He killed himself last night.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.478
All right.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.444
Call your parents
once in a while.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.655
It's really not that hard.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.825
Yeah.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.499
I'm what the leaders of the Tea Party

26:24.583 --> 26:27.460
would call a RINO. Republican In Name Only.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.671
And that's ironic,
because that's exactly what I think

26:29.755 --> 26:31.172
about the leaders of the Tea Party,

26:31.257 --> 26:35.009
because the most conservative Republicans
today aren't Republicans.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.096
Republicans believe in a prohibitive military.

26:38.347 --> 26:40.181
We believe in a common-sense government

26:40.349 --> 26:43.518
and that there are social programs enacted
in the last half-century that work,

26:43.644 --> 26:47.397
but there are way too many,
costing way too much, that don't.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.358
And we believe in the rule of law and order
and free-market capitalism.

26:50.818 --> 26:54.612
The Tea Party believes in loving America,
but hating Americans.

26:54.697 --> 26:57.407
Tea Party Congressman Allen West of Florida,

26:57.658 --> 27:00.535
"I must confess when I see anyone with
an Obama bumper sticker,

27:00.619 --> 27:03.871
"I recognize them as a threat
to the gene pool."

27:03.956 --> 27:06.791
They believe in loving America,
but hating its government.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.835
Conservative activist Grover Norquist.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.628
I don't want to
abolish government,

27:10.713 --> 27:12.714
I simply want to reduce it
to the size where I can

27:12.798 --> 27:15.258
drag it into the bathroom
and drown it in the bathtub.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.094
And they believe that
anyone who disagrees with the Tea Party

27:18.304 --> 27:20.638
has sinister anti-American motives.

27:20.723 --> 27:23.391
The objective of the liberals
is to destroy this country.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.644
The objective of the liberals
is to make America mediocre.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.229
Most of all, you must never,

27:28.314 --> 27:29.814
under any circumstance,

27:29.898 --> 27:31.774
seek to reach a compromise
with your opponent

27:31.942 --> 27:36.487
or do any of what Democrats and genuine
Republicans both call governing.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.282
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.868
Our top political priority over
the next two years

27:41.952 --> 27:44.829
should be to deny
President Obama a second term.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.248
And one other plank in the Tea Party platform,

27:47.416 --> 27:51.586
if you're poor, it means you're either too lazy
or too stupid to be rich.

27:51.920 --> 27:56.299
Here's André Bauer, Tea Party leader
and Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.135
"My grandmother was not
a highly educated woman,

27:59.219 --> 28:03.139
"but she told me as a small child
to quit feeding stray animals.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.600
"You know why? Because they breed."

28:05.809 --> 28:10.480
It's almost hard to believe Republicans can't
get Dorothy Cooper to vote for them.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.193
- Don't give up on this.
- It's not up to me.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.195
We have the guy. We've had him for 10 weeks.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.696
We have a guy named Charizma.

28:18.864 --> 28:20.448
Tell me where he lives
and I'll kick in his door.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.326
I get we only have an alias, but he fucked up
once already because of his ego.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.953
He'll fuck up again.
Let me keep smoking him out.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.039
Excuse me, Mr. Skinner. I'm sorry.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.999
You can just leave that on Millie's desk.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.626
She's not here right now
and it was messengered.

28:31.710 --> 28:32.960
It says, "Personal and Confidential."

28:33.045 --> 28:34.629
They all say, "Personal and Confidential."

28:34.713 --> 28:36.506
- I'll take it.
- Yes, sir.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.383
How are you gonna smoke him out?

28:38.467 --> 28:40.218
I've already taken credit for the death threat.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.178
Now let me say the FBI caught me.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.013
His head will explode
because he and his friends

28:44.098 --> 28:45.681
know the FBI is way outclassed,

28:45.766 --> 28:48.559
outnumbered and technologically behind.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.812
- He'll wanna prove he didn't get caught.
- Yeah.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.730
And what happens then?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.273
I don't know.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.485
That's always my favorite answer.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.362
- Charlie.
- Please, don't mess around with these...

28:59.446 --> 29:01.030
Go ahead.

29:03.325 --> 29:04.450
- I'm sorry?
- Do it.

29:04.618 --> 29:07.120
Great. Thank you.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.101
My name is Jenny. I'm a sophomore,
and this is for all three of you.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.938
Can you say in one sentence or less what...

29:34.022 --> 29:35.565
You know what I mean.

29:36.567 --> 29:40.278
Can you say why America
is the greatest country in the world?

29:40.362 --> 29:42.780
- How are you feeling?
- Very handsome.

29:42.865 --> 29:45.116
The doctor says you can go home Monday

29:45.200 --> 29:46.200
and come back to work in a week.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.619
I like it here. Being bedridden suits me.

29:48.704 --> 29:52.165
How many times do I have to tell you
this guy is an idiot?

29:52.374 --> 29:55.418
Hell hath no fury like the second rate.
Don't you know that?

29:55.711 --> 29:58.129
He quotes my colleagues,
everyone I respect in news.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.089
- You respect the wrong people.
- No.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.049
- Were any of them quoted by name?
- Plenty of them.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.093
Anyone that doesn't have
an ax to grind with you?

30:04.178 --> 30:07.889
The rest were pussy-ass, coward-ass,
pussified pussies.

30:08.015 --> 30:09.557
It just doesn't matter anymore.

30:10.517 --> 30:12.351
You're right, it doesn't.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.103
It just doesn't.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.523
You wanna hear something that does?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.775
I just want you to say hi to someone.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.403
- Nurse Cooper.
- Oh, please, not Nurse Cooper.

30:22.488 --> 30:26.657
She's not nice and I think she's
trying to euthanize me.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.451
I heard that.

30:28.535 --> 30:31.579
Nurses are the most underappreciated
members of our society.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.998
I've handled bigger schmucks than you.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.375
- Tell him about your great-aunt.
- Seriously?

30:36.752 --> 30:40.379
My great-aunt Dorothy Cooper is 96 years old

30:40.464 --> 30:42.381
and has been voting for 75 years.

30:42.633 --> 30:46.093
Now the state of Tennessee
is saying she can't vote.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.095
Voter ID?

30:48.180 --> 30:49.805
I wanna know what
you're gonna do about that.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.517
- Well, there's not a lot I...
- I wanna know why I don't see it on the news.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.684
Well, the reason...

30:53.769 --> 30:55.478
Why did my aunt become less American

30:55.562 --> 30:57.480
- because she doesn't have a car?
- Yeah, that's a reasonable...

30:57.564 --> 31:01.901
And why, young man, isn't this the first story
on the news every night?

31:03.320 --> 31:04.862
- She usually decides.
- Shut up.

31:04.947 --> 31:06.280
Okay.

31:06.823 --> 31:09.534
I want to see this story on the news.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.958
I kind of wanna see it on the news, too.

31:23.715 --> 31:30.555
Will?

31:33.976 --> 31:35.977
- The voicemail message.
- What are you talking about?

31:36.061 --> 31:39.730
The voicemail message
that I left you that night after I got home

31:39.815 --> 31:42.608
from the bin Laden broadcast?
Did you play it for anyone?

31:42.693 --> 31:43.693
I never got a message.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.737
No, I left you that message that started,

31:46.822 --> 31:48.739
"Hey, listen, it's me.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.700
"I'm not just saying this
because I'm high right now."

31:50.867 --> 31:53.035
- Did anyone else hear that message?
- I didn't hear that message.

31:53.370 --> 31:56.831
Mac, there is no way that you don't remember
what that message said.

31:57.040 --> 32:01.335
It wouldn't be possible for me to remember
what it said because I never got it.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.629
And it wouldn't have been possible
for me to play it

32:03.714 --> 32:07.091
for someone else because I never got it.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.346
Nina's first source was you.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.434
- Yeah.
- Guys, I don't understand.

32:16.518 --> 32:18.936
And that's why TMI! Is waiting
for the second source.

32:19.021 --> 32:23.190
- They can't reveal how they got the first.
- There was no message!

32:23.609 --> 32:27.153
Because your phone was hacked
and they deleted it.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.541
- What are you doing?
- I am reporting on Dorothy Cooper.

32:40.626 --> 32:41.667
You're still sick.

32:41.752 --> 32:44.670
"What is illness to the body
of our knight errant?

32:44.755 --> 32:46.672
"What matter wounds?

32:46.757 --> 32:48.507
"For each time he falls..."

32:48.592 --> 32:49.592
What's he doing?

32:49.676 --> 32:51.802
The end of Don Quixote. Put the tubes back.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.305
"Each time he falls, he shall rise again.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.389
"Woe to the wicked.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.309
"Sancho, my armor, my sword!"

32:58.393 --> 33:00.519
- Which one of us is he talking to?
- Get back in bed!

33:00.604 --> 33:03.105
I'm fine. Okay, I'm a little dizzy.

33:03.190 --> 33:05.483
I've got alarms going off
at the nurse's station.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.818
- Who pulled out the IV line?
- She did.

33:07.903 --> 33:11.238
I need to get some information
about your great-aunt.

33:17.537 --> 33:19.664
We need two maps,
one with every voter ID law

33:19.748 --> 33:22.083
and another with Tea Party governors' wins.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.045
He didn't create the recession,

33:26.129 --> 33:27.922
but he made it worse and longer.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.465
When he took office,

33:29.549 --> 33:32.760
the economy was in recession
and he made it worse.

33:32.844 --> 33:35.680
An NBC reporter asks Romney
why he keeps saying

33:35.764 --> 33:38.391
Obama made the economy worse
when it's gotten better.

33:38.475 --> 33:39.850
And here's Romney's answer.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.103
I didn't say that things are worse.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.229
Cut the film.

33:43.313 --> 33:46.232
This line that looks like Kilimanjaro
shows profits for the job creators,

33:46.316 --> 33:48.859
and this line that's as flat as my abs
shows employment.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.362
- Joey, build that graphic.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.918
What I would say
is that the news media should do

34:06.002 --> 34:09.004
a penetrating exposé and take a look.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.256
I wish they would.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.050
I wish the American media would take
a great look

34:13.135 --> 34:15.720
at the views of the people in Congress
and find out

34:15.804 --> 34:18.097
are they pro-America or anti-America.

34:18.181 --> 34:21.809
I think people would
love to see an exposé like that.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.654
The RNC just released
an ad slamming Obama for vacation days.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.240
Obama has taken 61 vacation days.

34:36.324 --> 34:39.201
At this point in his first term,
Reagan had taken 112

34:39.286 --> 34:42.121
while George W. Bush had taken 180.

34:45.167 --> 34:46.792
John Adams.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.674
Thomas Jefferson.

34:55.343 --> 34:57.928
James Madison.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.973
George Washington.

35:04.352 --> 35:05.770
The Treaty of Tripoli.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.354
Go on home for the night. You look tired.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.774
I'm supposed to meet Don
and Lisa for dinner, but I can stay.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.734
No, you look terrible.
You should get some sleep.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.402
I've never seen you look so bad.

35:13.487 --> 35:15.404
- What are you doing?
- I was being supportive.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.784
- You're done for the night.
- Good night.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.203
Sorry.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.463
"I can't make it. Sorry.

35:32.547 --> 35:35.007
"Swing by my place around midnight."

35:35.091 --> 35:36.258
Is this okay with you?

35:36.343 --> 35:37.718
- He's working hard.
- On a Sunday?

35:38.553 --> 35:39.720
Yeah, on a Sunday.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.472
We've all been working all weekend.

35:41.556 --> 35:45.059
And Don's been helping out
and it's not even his show.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.312
- What are you trying to say?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

35:48.563 --> 35:50.523
What are you trying to say?

35:50.607 --> 35:53.400
- In a year you've gone nowhere.
- Wait, that's...

35:53.485 --> 35:55.820
This is exactly what it was like when the two
of you started dating.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.321
"Swing by around midnight."

35:57.405 --> 35:59.156
I'm not saying he needs to take a knee,

35:59.241 --> 36:00.658
- but holy cow, how many times...
- I get it.

36:00.742 --> 36:01.700
- Do you?
- Yes.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.785
- Maggie.
- Stop.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.246
- It's hard to watch you...
- It's hard to watch you!

36:09.084 --> 36:10.709
What does that mean?

36:10.794 --> 36:11.919
Nothing.

36:12.546 --> 36:13.879
What did it mean?

36:18.802 --> 36:21.762
The night you and Jim got back together.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.224
When he came to our place to see me?

36:26.768 --> 36:28.018
- Lisa.
- What?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.104
I don't...

36:30.230 --> 36:32.773
Don's not sure he was there to see you.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.109
What are you talking about?

36:36.736 --> 36:37.945
- Nothing.
- What?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.238
- I'm wrong.
- What do you mean

36:39.322 --> 36:40.906
he might not have been there to see me?

36:40.991 --> 36:44.535
You kissed him and you pulled him
out the door

36:44.619 --> 36:47.037
before he finished his sentence.

36:57.549 --> 36:58.799
- I have to go.
- No, Lisa.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.969
- No, it's okay.
- No, I'm sure I'm wrong.

37:02.053 --> 37:04.722
- I forgot I have to be at a place.
- Lisa!

37:07.559 --> 37:11.312
Lisa! Lisa! Oh!

37:13.899 --> 37:16.150
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.694
To the left is this famous brownstone

37:18.778 --> 37:22.823
where Carrie Bradshaw lived, loved, and lost.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.783
Thanks to Carrie, we all got to live

37:24.868 --> 37:28.120
the typical life of a single woman
in New York City.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.499
Hey!

37:32.584 --> 37:34.209
No, you didn't!

37:34.294 --> 37:37.296
I'm a typical single woman in New York City!

37:37.380 --> 37:40.883
I don't wear heels to work
because the typical woman's job

37:40.967 --> 37:43.677
doesn't exclusively involve gallery openings.

37:43.762 --> 37:48.432
And I know Carrie must have made boatloads
writing her 800-word column for a newspaper

37:48.516 --> 37:51.435
no one's ever heard of,
but I just spent my last $7

37:51.519 --> 37:52.978
having a fight with my best friend

37:53.063 --> 37:56.774
who, by the way, is not available at 3:00 p.m.
On a Wednesday

37:56.858 --> 38:01.111
to console me about some guy,
because she, too, has a job.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.238
And mostly, when you fall

38:03.323 --> 38:04.615
for a guy and he's going out

38:04.699 --> 38:07.534
with your best friend, it doesn't work out.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.412
Things get really bad!

38:12.415 --> 38:13.707
Maggie?

38:15.794 --> 38:18.045
Oh, no.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.341
I was just...

38:22.425 --> 38:26.053
I was talking about other people.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.390
Stay right there.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.558
Maggie, wait! Let me off!

38:31.643 --> 38:33.644
Excuse me.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.459
I'm with Lisa.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.003
I know.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.423
And you're with Don.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.968
I don't know if I want to be.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.514
If Don had committed to you?

39:54.309 --> 39:56.101
- He didn't.
- But if he did?

39:56.644 --> 39:59.438
Then neither of us would be standing here.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.988
You should get some sleep.

40:08.114 --> 40:10.032
You, too.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.161
I have to talk to Don.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.392
During Tea Party rallies
and campaign speeches,

40:37.477 --> 40:40.521
we've been told that America
was founded as a Christian nation

40:40.605 --> 40:44.316
and that if the Founding Fathers
were here today, they'd tell us so.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.944
Here's John Adams in the Treaty of Tripoli,

40:47.028 --> 40:49.696
"As the government
of the United States is not,

40:49.823 --> 40:52.699
"in any sense, founded on
the Christian religion."

40:53.159 --> 40:54.827
And here's Thomas Jefferson,

40:54.911 --> 40:58.705
"That our civil rights have no dependence
on our religious opinions."

40:59.165 --> 41:01.333
And here's the First Amendment
to the US Constitution,

41:01.668 --> 41:05.379
"Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion."

41:05.839 --> 41:08.632
What's more frightening
than the perversion of our great history

41:08.716 --> 41:11.051
is that sensible, smart, strong Republicans,

41:11.219 --> 41:15.097
the very men and women who should be
standing up to radical fundamentalism,

41:15.473 --> 41:17.641
are so frightened of losing primary battles

41:17.725 --> 41:20.894
to religious zealots
that they've thrown in the towel on sanity.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.604
So we get this.

41:22.772 --> 41:26.358
Yes, the Constitution established

41:26.693 --> 41:29.069
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.

41:29.237 --> 41:32.072
It's ironic because the biggest enemy
of the phony Republican

41:32.323 --> 41:34.324
isn't Nancy Pelosi, or Harry Reid,

41:34.409 --> 41:36.326
or Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama,

41:36.744 --> 41:38.912
it's this man.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.874
He said, "Heal the sick, feed the hungry,

41:41.958 --> 41:46.003
"care for the weakest among us,
and always pray in private."

41:47.213 --> 41:49.423
"It's been over a year.

41:49.507 --> 41:51.675
"I'm not your midnight girl."

41:51.759 --> 41:54.511
Midnight thing.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.847
Ugh. Midnight piece of ass.

41:57.098 --> 41:58.348
Midnight girl.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.435
"I'm not your midnight girl."

42:02.312 --> 42:04.354
Not a midnight girl?

42:04.522 --> 42:05.522
Your midnight girl?

42:12.739 --> 42:14.031
Hi.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.241
Don't say anything. Just let me talk.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.160
Okay.

42:21.289 --> 42:22.456
Hang on.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.425
"Don, I was disappointed and embarrassed..."

42:33.509 --> 42:35.302
Do you wanna come in?

42:35.762 --> 42:37.554
Okay.

42:41.851 --> 42:44.686
"Don, I was disappointed and..."

42:45.939 --> 42:47.648
What's happening now?

42:54.155 --> 42:55.864
I'm asking you to move in with me.

42:59.327 --> 43:01.662
This is a key.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.790
I already have a key.

43:05.500 --> 43:07.292
This one's in a box.

43:09.879 --> 43:11.713
I badly want to make this work.

43:28.523 --> 43:30.774
Hi, you've reached
the voicemail of Maggie Jordan.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.401
I can't get to the phone right now,

43:32.485 --> 43:35.320
but please leave a message
and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

43:44.872 --> 43:47.958
The idea of strict
or absolute separation of church and state

43:48.042 --> 43:51.420
is not and never was the American model.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.671
You ready?

43:52.755 --> 43:55.215
Now it's a model used in
countries like Turkey and France.

43:58.177 --> 43:59.761
- Good evening.
- Evening.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.725
- Will, good to see you up and about.
- Thank you.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.435
Thank you for the gift basket.

44:06.519 --> 44:07.936
The Tabasco and cayenne pepper.

44:08.021 --> 44:09.187
I'm crazy about your sense of humor.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.272
I thought you'd appreciate it.

44:10.398 --> 44:13.025
And you have a body that refuses to quit.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.736
If Playboy ever
decided to do a "Women of NASDAQ" layout...

44:15.820 --> 44:17.904
Reese tells me you were high on the air

44:17.989 --> 44:20.991
while reporting on the death
of Osama bin Laden.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.160
It would be a tasteful layout,

44:23.244 --> 44:25.120
like, "Ooh, I dropped my quarterly
stockholders report."

44:25.204 --> 44:27.039
You were high on the air?

44:27.123 --> 44:29.166
Now, how would you know that, Reese?

44:29.250 --> 44:31.835
Will, were you high on the air

44:31.919 --> 44:33.837
the night we killed bin Laden?

44:34.213 --> 44:36.131
I was.

44:37.133 --> 44:39.593
- You're admitting it?
- Could not feel my face.

44:40.428 --> 44:43.347
Well...

44:43.431 --> 44:44.848
You were very good.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, and you're fired.

44:47.185 --> 44:49.311
- You can't fire him.
- Yet I just did.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.773
Okay, but if you do, your son's going to jail
for a little while.

44:53.274 --> 44:55.317
What the hell are you talking about?

44:55.401 --> 44:57.027
- You hacked my phone.
- No, I didn't.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.696
This will go a lot faster
if you'd just say, "Yes, I did."

44:59.781 --> 45:01.239
- I didn't.
- We have a show in an hour.

45:01.324 --> 45:03.950
- And you're fired, too.
- Why is she saying you hacked...

45:04.035 --> 45:05.952
- Desperation.
- You hacked her phone

45:06.120 --> 45:09.122
and you deleted the message from Will
where he said he was high.

45:09.290 --> 45:10.332
You got some proof?

45:10.416 --> 45:12.042
That's how Nina Howard knew
that Will was high.

45:12.126 --> 45:14.795
- You got proof?
- Solomon Hancock.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.715
He's an NSA analyst
who was giving me information

45:18.800 --> 45:20.926
about illegal domestic surveillance.

45:21.010 --> 45:25.097
He jumped off the Queensboro Bridge
four days ago.

45:25.181 --> 45:28.975
But before he did, he had this envelope
sent to me.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.480
It's a record of Reese
ordering hacking of phones

45:33.564 --> 45:35.232
belonging to MacKenzie McHale,

45:35.316 --> 45:37.901
Howard Stern, Casey Anthony's lawyers,

45:37.985 --> 45:41.321
and relatives of hostages
killed by Somali pirates.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.824
It's all here.

45:44.784 --> 45:47.244
Leona, didn't you ever ask how TMI!

45:47.328 --> 45:49.246
Got some of the information it published?

45:49.330 --> 45:51.998
- I just assumed they made it up.
- They do, most of the time,

45:52.792 --> 45:54.459
but Nina didn't make this up.

45:54.544 --> 45:56.920
In this case, I thought
that someone on the staff...

45:57.004 --> 45:58.713
There's a transcript in this envelope.

45:58.798 --> 46:00.465
Did you order hacking?

46:01.467 --> 46:02.926
Reese?

46:05.930 --> 46:08.932
I ordered that the magazine stay competitive.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.434
Answer the question. Did you order...

46:10.518 --> 46:13.520
Yes. All right? I did.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.939
Are you out of your mind? That's a felony.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.607
This is how the tabloid world works

46:17.775 --> 46:20.110
and that magazine turns a profit in
a competitive market.

46:20.194 --> 46:23.113
And, by the way, this is what you wanted.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.740
No, it's not.

46:25.825 --> 46:30.245
It is not remotely what I wanted, ever.

46:31.456 --> 46:33.748
Good enough?

46:35.209 --> 46:38.044
Yes, of course.

46:38.129 --> 46:40.005
I don't give a shit. Hand it to the FBI.

46:40.089 --> 46:41.882
I'll go to jail before I'm blackmailed.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.676
- You're not going to jail.
- I'm not being fucking blackmailed.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.803
You get your lawyers, I'll get mine.

46:46.888 --> 46:48.680
Leona, you're one of us. You know you are.

46:49.849 --> 46:52.225
Stand for something.

46:52.310 --> 46:54.728
These guys do.
They were willing to lose their jobs.

46:54.979 --> 46:57.272
This guy does. He jumped off a bridge.

46:58.232 --> 47:02.360
They're lying, Leona. They're just lying.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.530
A bunch of fatuous, mean-spirited bigots

47:06.073 --> 47:08.909
screaming platitudes about
what America stands for.

47:09.660 --> 47:12.245
Let's show 'em what we won't stand for.

47:13.664 --> 47:17.501
Let's do the news. You and me.

47:22.215 --> 47:24.841
And what about this and the tape?

47:24.926 --> 47:26.927
You're gonna kill the story about Will.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.678
Ours was the best coverage of the night

47:28.763 --> 47:31.014
and Will anchored it beautifully.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.349
No more tabloid stories,

47:32.433 --> 47:33.642
and I'm gonna make it easy for you

47:33.726 --> 47:35.101
because you're shutting down your tabloid.

47:35.186 --> 47:36.436
You want me to shut down a profit center?

47:36.521 --> 47:40.023
You reported $14 billion
of net revenue last year.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.067
You won't miss the $80 million from TMI!

47:42.151 --> 47:44.277
And what reason do we give publicly?

47:44.362 --> 47:46.988
You don't fancy yourselves
the owner of a whore house.

47:47.156 --> 47:48.990
You'll get terrific press.

47:49.075 --> 47:52.202
You know me well enough to know
I do not negotiate like this.

47:53.538 --> 47:55.997
This wasn't a negotiation.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.042
They're gonna do their show.

47:59.210 --> 48:00.752
You think about it.

48:01.754 --> 48:06.383
And whatever happens next happens next.

48:16.018 --> 48:18.562
Give six months' salary
to a school or something.

48:22.483 --> 48:23.650
Will.

48:27.822 --> 48:29.864
Don't shoot and miss.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.580
Lucky for Will he's got
the aim of a sharpshooter

48:36.664 --> 48:39.374
who's been trained to shoot
and hit the target that...

48:39.458 --> 48:42.419
- You can't just start to say something with...
- I know, I'm sorry.

48:49.135 --> 48:51.845
We don't have to lay down for this.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.434
Oh, God.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.145
What?

49:00.771 --> 49:02.564
It's a recipe for beef stew.

49:06.569 --> 49:08.612
You can't announce your
intention to not pay your bills

49:08.696 --> 49:10.780
and then expect to keep your credit rating.

49:10.865 --> 49:12.032
Like petulant children, the Tea Party

49:12.116 --> 49:15.076
took the economy hostage
and then bragged about it.

49:15.161 --> 49:16.661
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell

49:16.746 --> 49:18.038
to the Washington Post,

49:18.205 --> 49:19.789
"I think some of our members
may have thought

49:19.874 --> 49:21.124
"the default issue was a hostage

49:21.208 --> 49:23.001
"you might take a chance at shooting,"
he said.

49:23.169 --> 49:24.711
"Most of us didn't think that.

49:24.837 --> 49:26.171
"What we did learn is this.

49:26.464 --> 49:28.298
"It's a hostage worth ransoming."

49:29.050 --> 49:30.342
Will?

49:30.426 --> 49:32.844
We'll be right back.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.179
2:30 back.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.764
- Nice.
- Bring it home.

49:35.890 --> 49:38.099
Who is the girl sitting
in the back of the newsroom?

49:38.184 --> 49:39.142
I don't know. Listen...

49:39.226 --> 49:41.227
She's been sitting there all day
and all through the broadcast,

49:41.312 --> 49:42.437
and I feel like I know her.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.774
Yeah. "The greater fool"
is actually an economic term.

49:46.067 --> 49:47.942
- It's a patsy.
- Thanks for that.

49:48.944 --> 49:51.488
For the rest of us to profit,
we need a greater fool,

49:51.572 --> 49:53.615
someone who will buy long and sell short.

49:53.908 --> 49:57.619
Most people spend their lives
trying not to be the greater fool.

49:57.953 --> 49:59.162
We toss him the hot potato.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.748
We dive for his seat when the music stops.

50:01.874 --> 50:03.833
The greater fool is someone
with the perfect blend

50:03.918 --> 50:05.794
of self-delusion and ego

50:05.920 --> 50:09.130
to think that he can succeed
where others have failed.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.259
This whole country
was made by greater fools.

50:17.098 --> 50:18.765
You're staying?

50:25.398 --> 50:26.648
Forty-five seconds back.

50:26.732 --> 50:28.441
- Hey, Joey.
- Yes, ma'am.

50:28.567 --> 50:31.986
Back in the A block, did you hear the sound
go out after...

50:32.071 --> 50:35.073
Did I hear the sound go out after what?

50:37.535 --> 50:38.576
Mac?

50:50.423 --> 50:53.466
- What was the rest of the message?
- What?

50:53.551 --> 50:56.261
"I'm not just saying this because I'm high."

50:56.345 --> 50:57.762
Saying what?

50:57.847 --> 50:59.931
What was the rest of the message?

51:00.808 --> 51:01.891
Hmm.

51:01.976 --> 51:03.476
What was the rest of the message?

51:03.602 --> 51:05.895
Ten seconds.

51:17.158 --> 51:18.950
In three, two...

51:21.662 --> 51:23.246
Ideological purity,

51:23.330 --> 51:24.748
compromise as weakness,

51:24.832 --> 51:27.125
a fundamentalist belief
in scriptural literalism,

51:27.209 --> 51:30.336
denying science, unmoved by facts,

51:30.421 --> 51:32.213
undeterred by new information,

51:32.298 --> 51:34.048
a hostile fear of progress,

51:34.133 --> 51:36.050
a demonization of education,

51:36.177 --> 51:38.386
a need to control women's bodies,

51:38.471 --> 51:39.971
severe xenophobia,

51:40.055 --> 51:42.682
tribal mentality, intolerance of dissent,

51:42.767 --> 51:46.186
and a pathological hatred
of the US government.

51:46.312 --> 51:48.438
They can call themselves the Tea Party.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.648
They can call themselves conservatives.

51:50.733 --> 51:53.067
And they can even
call themselves Republicans,

51:53.152 --> 51:55.195
though Republicans certainly shouldn't.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.530
But we should call them what they are.

51:57.698 --> 51:59.991
The American Taliban.

52:00.117 --> 52:05.205
And the American Taliban cannot survive
if Dorothy Cooper is allowed to vote.

52:11.420 --> 52:14.005
Terry Smith is coming up next
with The Capitol Report.

52:14.089 --> 52:17.634
This is News Night.
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

52:20.054 --> 52:22.680
We're clear.

52:24.892 --> 52:26.601
Good job.

52:34.193 --> 52:35.652
- I heard you were staying.
- Yes.

52:35.736 --> 52:37.153
Yeah, I will still be working here,

52:37.238 --> 52:39.864
as will you, and I am mortified.

52:39.949 --> 52:41.866
We will both be working here,
but we will never speak

52:41.951 --> 52:44.118
or make eye contact ever again starting now.

52:44.245 --> 52:46.246
I don't think that's realistic.

52:46.497 --> 52:49.123
I just turned down $4 million a year

52:49.208 --> 52:52.418
so that I can try to do some good
by reporting the news.

52:52.586 --> 52:55.421
Do I sound like someone
who's living in the world of the realistic?

52:55.548 --> 52:57.882
- It's really...
- Starting now.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.100
I gotta get ready for the 10:00.

53:07.184 --> 53:08.852
- See you at Hang Chew's?
- Yeah.

53:09.103 --> 53:10.353
Mmm.

53:20.948 --> 53:22.198
- Hello.
- Hey.

53:23.951 --> 53:26.619
I can't be sure, but I think you're avoiding me.

53:27.496 --> 53:29.372
Lisa said you guys had a good talk.

53:29.456 --> 53:30.832
Yeah.

53:30.916 --> 53:32.625
She asked me who I really came to see

53:32.710 --> 53:34.669
that night we got back together.

53:36.255 --> 53:38.631
And you lied to her.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.552
You made her very happy.

53:42.636 --> 53:44.762
I figured when you didn't
answer your phone...

53:44.847 --> 53:48.016
You knew Don was asking me?

53:48.225 --> 53:49.392
Yeah.

53:54.106 --> 53:56.107
- You're a good guy.
- So is Don.

53:59.403 --> 54:02.655
- Jim...
- You know, I'm not done with that NSA story.

54:02.865 --> 54:05.533
I'm gonna make sure Hancock
isn't dead for nothing.

54:09.622 --> 54:11.080
What did the rest of the message say?

54:11.165 --> 54:14.000
I honestly don't remember.

54:14.126 --> 54:15.793
Did you know that Maggie and Don
are moving in together,

54:15.878 --> 54:18.087
even though Maggie should be with Jim
and Don should be with Sloan?

54:18.172 --> 54:21.132
How many lives must you ruin before you'll
get out of the life-ruining business?

54:21.216 --> 54:22.508
It's a cautionary tale.

54:22.593 --> 54:25.053
Maggie is now with the wrong man.

54:25.137 --> 54:27.680
- It's not gonna last.
- Because true love always wins?

54:27.848 --> 54:29.474
Yeah.

54:32.853 --> 54:35.855
It was a hallucination.

54:36.273 --> 54:38.191
I got asked the question at Northwestern,

54:38.275 --> 54:40.485
"What makes America the greatest country
in the world?"

54:40.569 --> 54:43.112
There was a woman who looked like you
sitting in the audience.

54:43.197 --> 54:45.448
There were a lot of lights
and a lot of noise in my head,

54:45.532 --> 54:47.450
and I could have sworn that the woman

54:47.534 --> 54:48.576
who looked like you

54:48.661 --> 54:51.037
was holding up a pad.

54:58.379 --> 54:59.796
- It was you?
- Yep.

54:59.880 --> 55:01.881
- It was you?
- Yeah.

55:06.845 --> 55:09.263
You're melting now, aren't you?

55:11.725 --> 55:14.227
Your heart is full.

55:18.524 --> 55:21.109
Just say what you're feeling.

55:25.406 --> 55:27.907
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

55:27.992 --> 55:30.868
I was waiting for the right time!

55:30.953 --> 55:33.037
Fifteen months ago was the right time.

55:33.122 --> 55:34.205
It was you!

55:34.289 --> 55:36.499
No, it was you, Billy.

55:36.583 --> 55:38.584
I was just producing.

55:38.711 --> 55:41.295
What did the rest of the message say?

55:43.132 --> 55:44.340
There's a girl sitting in the newsroom.

55:44.425 --> 55:46.676
- Don't worry about her.
- No, she looks familiar to me.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.553
She's applying for an internship.
She's been waiting all day.

55:48.637 --> 55:51.556
- Why does she look familiar?
- Excuse us.

55:54.601 --> 55:56.978
I'll be in the conference room.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.357
What can I do for you?

56:01.525 --> 56:03.609
Tell him, Columbo.

56:03.902 --> 56:06.612
I went on the message board

56:06.697 --> 56:08.031
and posted that I'd been caught

56:08.115 --> 56:10.324
and that I was now being used
as an FBI informant.

56:10.409 --> 56:13.411
I did this in the hope
of smoking out the real culprit because,

56:13.495 --> 56:14.871
you see, the only thing these people cherish

56:14.955 --> 56:16.539
more than anonymity is worldwide fame.

56:16.623 --> 56:19.751
So by both taking credit and implying
we'd been defeated by...

56:19.835 --> 56:22.128
- What happened?
- You got 100 new death threats.

56:22.212 --> 56:25.548
- A hundred?
- Really more a protest than a threat.

56:25.632 --> 56:28.217
- Is that how the insurance company sees it?
- No.

56:28.302 --> 56:29.343
- No. So we're still...
- Yeah.

56:29.428 --> 56:31.387
- It was over and now it's...
- Yeah.

56:31.472 --> 56:33.306
Well, I'm glad you two are on the case.

56:34.892 --> 56:38.061
Who is the girl who is applying
to the internship?

56:38.145 --> 56:39.854
She looks so familiar to me.

56:39.938 --> 56:43.399
I'll tell you who she looks like.
She looks exactly like...

56:47.988 --> 56:49.280
- Good show.
- I don't care.

56:49.364 --> 56:50.823
Okay.

56:51.700 --> 56:54.535
- Sorority girl!
- Don't be scared.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.205
- You're the girl, right?
- I'm Jennifer Johnson.

56:57.289 --> 56:59.165
- Just graduated Northwestern?
- Stay calm.

56:59.249 --> 57:01.375
- A year early.
- You asked me that moronic question

57:01.460 --> 57:03.461
and then my world came apart
and she came here

57:03.545 --> 57:06.255
and I landed in the tabloids
and I got death threats

57:06.340 --> 57:08.257
and my job is constantly in jeopardy

57:08.342 --> 57:09.467
and you ruined my life?

57:09.551 --> 57:12.470
- Again, just stay calm.
- Yes, that was me.

57:13.764 --> 57:14.764
What the hell are you doing here?

57:14.848 --> 57:16.849
- I'm applying for an internship.
- Why?

57:19.019 --> 57:22.271
I watch the show
and I read the New York Magazine article

57:22.356 --> 57:24.690
and I know what a greater fool is.

57:24.858 --> 57:26.359
And I want to be one.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.867
Camelot, she's the kid at the end of Camelot.

57:40.374 --> 57:41.833
Ask me again.

57:42.209 --> 57:43.292
I'm sorry?

57:43.377 --> 57:45.670
Ask me your idiot question again.

57:49.550 --> 57:52.301
What makes America the greatest country
in the world?

57:55.722 --> 57:57.014
You do.

57:59.685 --> 58:00.768
Hire her.

58:07.234 --> 58:10.027
What did the rest of the message...

58:10.237 --> 58:11.654
Screw it.

58:11.780 --> 58:14.866
I'll just feed him another 10 cookies.

58:14.950 --> 58:16.576
Welcome to News Night.

58:19.163 --> 58:21.205
- A hundred more death threats.
- Yeah.

58:21.290 --> 58:24.167
- But we're pretty sure they're not serious.
- Not these hundred.

58:24.251 --> 58:27.753
But after tonight, I expect the next hundred
will be very serious.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.297
What do you protect me for?

58:29.381 --> 58:31.674
1,700 a week plus health and dental.

58:31.758 --> 58:34.343
I wouldn't take a bullet for 1,700 a week.

58:34.428 --> 58:37.054
Me neither, pal. So I've learned how to duck.

58:56.074 --> 58:58.367
Hey, it's me, Will.

58:58.493 --> 59:01.829
Listen, I swear I'm not
saying this because I'm high.

59:01.914 --> 59:03.873
If the answer is no, then just do me a favor

59:03.957 --> 59:06.876
and don't call me back
or bring it up or anything.

59:06.960 --> 59:09.879
But I have to tell you, I mean, after tonight,

59:09.963 --> 59:12.048
I really want to tell you
that I've never stopped...
