DOCTOR: Appalapachia.

00:02.440 --> 00:03.839
-AMY: Say it again?
-Appalapachia!

00:03.920 --> 00:04.959
Appalapachia!

00:05.040 --> 00:07.119
-Appalapachia.
-Appalapachia.

00:07.200 --> 00:08.919
Appalapachia! What a beautiful word!

00:09.000 --> 00:10.599
-Beautiful word, beautiful world.
-(AMY EXCLAIMS)

00:10.680 --> 00:11.759
Appalapachia!

00:11.840 --> 00:13.239
Voted number two planet

00:13.320 --> 00:18.039
inthe Top Ten Greatest Destinations for
the Discerning Intergalactic Traveller.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.199
-Why couldn't we go to number one?
-It's hideous!

00:20.280 --> 00:22.919
Everyone goes to number one,
planet of the coffee shops.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.519
Appalapachia. I give you sunsets,
spires, soaring silver colonnades.

00:27.600 --> 00:30.199
I give you...

00:30.840 --> 00:31.999
Doors.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.199
Doors, yes. I give you doors.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.159
But on the other side of those doors,
I give you sunsets, spires,

00:38.240 --> 00:39.799
soaring silver colonnades.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.359
Have you seen my phone?

00:41.760 --> 00:42.999
-Your phone?
-Yeah.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.319
Your mobile telephone.
I bring you to a paradise planet

00:45.400 --> 00:48.999
two billion light years from Earth
and you want to update Twitter?

00:49.080 --> 00:51.319
Sunsets, spires,
soaring silver colonnades.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.639
It's a camera phone.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.999
On the counter, by the DVDs.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.199
Thank you.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.239
-How do we get in?
-I don't know. Push a button.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.519
Okay, so, rain check
on the soaring silver colonnades.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.679
Yeah.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.199
It's a magnifying glass.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.199
-Hey, hey, it's locked.
-Yeah, push the button.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.639
Rory?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.199
Come on, Amy.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.159
Great.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.359
Where is she?

01:50.040 --> 01:52.839
Where on wherever we are is my wife?

01:58.560 --> 02:01.159
Rory, I think I've found her.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.039
What do you mean you've found her?
Whoa! But...

02:04.840 --> 02:07.719
No, but she's not here!

02:11.560 --> 02:13.159
DOCTOR:
I can see her, but she's not here.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.959
Where am I? In fact, where are you?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.759
-(ELECTRIC BUZZING)
-Whoa!

02:21.200 --> 02:23.279
Hands, hello, Hands.
Robot with hands, Rory.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.239
HANDBOT: Welcome to
the Two-Streams Facility.

02:25.320 --> 02:26.879
Will you be visiting long?

02:27.200 --> 02:28.759
Uh, Doctor, something's happening.

02:28.840 --> 02:31.719
Amy? Stay calm, stay still.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.639
Time's gone wobbly.
I hate it when it does that.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.439
Will you be visiting long?

02:37.520 --> 02:39.439
Good question. A bit sinister.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.559
What's the answer to not get us killed?

02:41.640 --> 02:43.079
It's okay. I've got you. You're fine.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.799
Will you be visiting long?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.399
Doctor, a little help, Doctor.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.639
And where have you been?

02:47.720 --> 02:49.159
-Will you be visiting long?
-What do I tell it?

02:49.240 --> 02:50.399
I've been here a week.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.079
-A week?
-RORY: A week!

02:52.640 --> 02:54.959
I'm so sorry.
Aha! Same room, different times.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.319
Two different time streams running
parallel, but at different speeds.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.719
Amy, you're in a faster time stream.

02:59.840 --> 03:00.919
Doctor, it's going again!

03:01.400 --> 03:02.799
-Doctor!
-Amy!

03:02.880 --> 03:04.159
Doctor!

03:04.240 --> 03:06.119
(DOCTOR WHO THEME)

03:39.440 --> 03:41.999
Ah, come on. Gotcha! There!

03:42.400 --> 03:43.919
Stabilised. Settled. Shh.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.279
Why has this got hands?

03:45.360 --> 03:47.719
Organic skin.
Ultimate universal interface.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.199
Grown and grafted, not born.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.999
I mean, it's actually seeing
with its fingers, scanning the room.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.159
-But why not just give it eyes?
-Will you be visiting long?

03:54.240 --> 03:55.319
DOCTOR: As long as it takes.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.639
Amy, what exactly did you do?

03:56.720 --> 03:59.359
I just came in
and pressed a door button.

03:59.440 --> 04:04.199
Oh! Amy, there are two buttons.
The green anchor and the red waterfall.

04:04.280 --> 04:05.799
Which one did you push?

04:06.440 --> 04:07.799
I pushed the red waterfall.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.479
Great.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.959
(DOCTOR TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

04:14.480 --> 04:15.599
(EXHALES)

04:26.720 --> 04:27.799
Amy?

04:31.600 --> 04:32.959
Argh!

04:38.520 --> 04:40.799
I pressed red waterfall
and she wasn't there!

04:40.880 --> 04:42.639
DOCTOR: Okay, so,
you can't follow her directly...

04:42.720 --> 04:44.279
No, it's never simple.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.559
Did you hear that, Handbot?

04:45.640 --> 04:46.719
She pressed the wrong button,
that's all.

04:46.800 --> 04:48.119
We're aliens, we didn't know!

04:48.200 --> 04:50.719
Statement rejected.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.359
Appalapachia is under
planet-wide quarantine.

04:55.280 --> 04:59.919
This is a Kindness Facility,
for those infected with Gen-7.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.519
What?

05:01.600 --> 05:02.999
DOCTOR: Gen-7.
RORY: Hmm?

05:03.080 --> 05:04.319
The one-day plague.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.599
-What, you get it for a day?
-No, you get it and you die in a day.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.159
There are 40,000 residents
in the Two-Streams Facility.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.879
Please remain in the sterile areas.
Visiting hours are now.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.079
Sterile area, I'm safe.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.159
What about me?

05:25.560 --> 05:28.319
Gen-7 only affects two-hearted races,
like Appalapachians.

05:28.520 --> 05:29.959
-And Time Lords.
-Yeah, like me.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.559
Walk into that facility,
I'm dead in a day.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.919
Time is faster on
Amy's side of the glass.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.639
Uh, Amy, you said you'd been here
a week. What did you eat?

05:37.720 --> 05:39.559
-Nothing. I wasn't hungry.
-No.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.319
Because with that big waterfall,
time is compressed.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.879
That's the point of the time glass.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.439
It syncs up the two time streams
for visits.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.159
You could be in here for a day.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.319
And watch them
live out their entire lives.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.679
And watch them grow old
in front of your eyes.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.399
That's horrible!

05:52.560 --> 05:55.319
No, Rory, it's kind.
You've got a choice.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.439
Sit by their bedside for 24 hours
and watch them die

05:59.640 --> 06:02.519
or sit in here for 24 hours
and watch them live.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.479
Which would you choose?

06:10.680 --> 06:11.879
Doctor?

06:12.920 --> 06:14.399
Doctor, no, don't leave me.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.159
I'm here, Amy. I'm right here.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.199
Where are you? Am I looking at you?

06:20.440 --> 06:22.519
Turn left, just a fraction.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.159
Bit more. Stop.

06:26.840 --> 06:27.919
That's it.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.039
Eye to eye?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.839
Eye to eye, do I.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.719
Hello.

06:32.840 --> 06:34.759
Amy, I'm taking the time glass
back to the Tardis.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.959
Like SatNav, I can use it
to get a lock on you,

06:37.040 --> 06:38.759
then smash through
using the Tardis to get you out.

06:38.840 --> 06:40.479
Until then, you're on your own.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.119
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Locking it onto Amy.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.399
Small act of vandalism,
no one will mind.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.519
-(ALARM BLARING)
-Ah!

06:44.600 --> 06:45.759
That'll be the
small act of vandalism alarm.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.079
Amy, I need you to go into the facility,
just for a bit.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.919
Find somewhere safe to leave me a sign.
Remember, you are immune to Gen-7

06:51.000 --> 06:53.079
but don't let them give you anything.
They don't know you're alien.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.039
Their kindness will kill you. Now, go.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.839
Rory, I love you.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.879
Now, save me. Go on.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.239
Ugh!

07:14.920 --> 07:16.519
This is locked onto Amy permanently.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.559
Play the signal into the console,
the Tardis will follow it.

07:22.120 --> 07:24.959
Now, then, I know you're in here...

07:25.040 --> 07:27.079
-(ALARM CLOCK RINGING)
-Um... Um...

07:27.920 --> 07:29.279
Ha-ha!

07:29.680 --> 07:31.599
-How do I look?
-Ridiculous.

07:31.720 --> 07:33.159
Glasses are cool, see?

07:34.080 --> 07:36.719
Oh, yes. Hello, handsome man.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.079
Oh, hello.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.119
Hello, Rorycam, huh?

07:40.760 --> 07:43.679
-Oh, you can see what I see, right.
-You're breaking into Two-Streams.

07:43.760 --> 07:46.559
Now, I can't go in there,
the Gen-7 will kill me. No regeneration.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.359
You will be my eyes and ears.

07:49.240 --> 07:51.719
-Rorycam. Rescue Amy. Got it.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.959
That's the spirit. Now, smashing through
a time wall could get a bit hairy.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.399
-Is it safe?
-Don't know. Never tried. Best hold on.

why not try the mountain zone,

08:52.680 --> 08:56.439
and explore Appalapachia's famous

You know what I mean. Where can I go
so the Handbots can't find me?

13:44.160 --> 13:46.799
Okay. Um, before, I was saved
by a sort of vent,

13:46.880 --> 13:49.559
and there was light and smoke,
and the Handbots couldn't see me.

13:49.640 --> 13:50.879
Why not?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.759
Okay, I will put it another way.
What were those vent thingies?

13:55.920 --> 13:59.079
The vents channel the exhaust fumes
from the temporal engines

13:59.160 --> 14:01.799
that hold the multiple time streams
in place.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.719
And these temporal engines
mess up the Handbots' sensors.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.559
So, where's the temporal engines?

14:08.040 --> 14:10.239
Temporal engines held within.

14:10.840 --> 14:11.959
Okay.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.159
HANDBOT:
Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.119
Ha! Don't like that, do you?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.319
Temporal engines. Somewhere to hide.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.279
Where is everyone?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.639
All right, Rory,
switch the time glass on the sonic key.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.559
I'm sending a command signal
to the screwdriver.

14:56.640 --> 14:59.279
Amy's here somewhere.
If I can just get a lock on her.

14:59.440 --> 15:03.439
I wonder what happens
if we mix the filters?

15:08.440 --> 15:11.959
And there they are.
40,000 time streams overlapping.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.559
Red Waterfall isn't one time stream.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.039
It's thousands.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.439
Are they happy?

15:19.520 --> 15:22.039
Oh, Rory, trust you to think of that.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.759
I think they're happy to be alive.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.319
Better than the alternative.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.039
I come in peace.
Peace, peace, peace, peace.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.719
(ELECTRONIC VOICE) I waited.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.319
Sorry, what?

15:38.080 --> 15:45.039
I waited for you.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.679
Amy.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.719
Doctor, what's going on?

15:54.960 --> 15:56.079
Uh...

16:00.360 --> 16:01.439
Amy.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.399
DOCTOR: I think the time stream lock
might be a bit wobbly.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.439
RORY: No, please, please.

16:08.520 --> 16:09.639
Duck.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.079
-Oh!
-Argh!

16:22.480 --> 16:25.119
Handbots carry a black box
in case they go offline.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.919
I've changed the cause of termination
from 'hostile' to 'accidental'.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.439
Easy to reprogram, use my sonic probe.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.279
-Amy.
-Rory.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.519
Why?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.079
Because the only way
I've survived this long

16:38.160 --> 16:39.879
is by making the Handbots think
I don't exist.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.439
Don't touch the hands.

16:41.520 --> 16:42.959
There's anaesthetic transfer
in the skin.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.359
If they touch you, you go to sleep.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.839
But you're still here.

16:48.760 --> 16:49.919
You didn't save me.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.559
But... This is the saving.
This is the us saving you.

16:58.760 --> 17:00.759
The Doctor just got
the timing a bit out!

17:00.840 --> 17:01.959
(MOUTHING)

17:03.600 --> 17:05.679
I've been on my own here
a long, long time.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.919
I've had decades
to think nice thoughts about him.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.999
Got a bit harder to stay charitable
once I entered decade four.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.679
40 years? Alone?

17:14.400 --> 17:17.079
36 years. Thanks.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.519
No, right, I mean...

17:20.280 --> 17:23.839
You look great. Really. Really.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.159
Eyes front, soldier.

17:27.600 --> 17:29.079
Still can't win, then?

17:29.160 --> 17:32.679
In fact, I think I can now
definitely say I hate him.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.159
I hate the Doctor.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.959
I hate him more than
I've ever hated anyone in my life.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.559
And you can hear it every word of this
through those ridiculous glasses,

17:40.640 --> 17:42.159
can't you, raggedy man?

17:42.240 --> 17:43.479
Uh, yes.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.159
Putting the speakerphone on.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.919
You told me to wait and I did.
A lifetime.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.719
-Amy!
-You've got nothing to say to me.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.399
Amy, behind you!

17:57.320 --> 18:00.479
Feedback knocks them out.
Learned that trick on my first day.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.119
Okay, so we just take the Tardis back
to the right time stream, eh?

18:07.040 --> 18:08.719
We can stop any of this happening.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.399
DOCTOR:
We locked onto a time stream, Rory.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.519
This is it.

18:11.600 --> 18:12.879
This is so wrong.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.479
I got old, Rory.
What did you think was going to happen?

18:15.560 --> 18:19.519
Hey, I don't care that you got old.
I care that we didn't grow old together.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.959
Amy, come on, please.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.479
Don't touch me. Don't do that.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.559
It's like you're not even her.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.159
Thirty-six years, three months,
four days of solitary confinement.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.679
This facility was built
to give people a chance to live.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.919
I walked in here and I died.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.879
Did you have anything to say?
Anything, Doctor?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.519
Where did you get a sonic screwdriver?

18:43.920 --> 18:46.039
I made it. And it's a sonic probe.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.119
You made a sonic screwdriver?

18:48.840 --> 18:49.879
Probe.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.039
Oh!

19:06.680 --> 19:08.839
Don't worry about him. Sit down, Rory.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.519
-You named him after me?
-Needed a bit of company.

19:21.280 --> 19:22.919
-Oh, so, he's like your...
-Pet.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.159
-Is it safe?
-Yeah. I disarmed it.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.159
How?

19:39.160 --> 19:41.959
Oh. You disarmed it.

19:43.920 --> 19:46.959
Oh, don't get sentimental.
It's just a robot.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.399
You'd have done the same.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.759
I don't that I would've.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.039
And there he is. The voice of God.

19:52.840 --> 19:56.599
"Survive, because
no one's going to come for you."

19:56.680 --> 19:59.199
Number one lesson. You taught me that.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.399
DOCTOR: Is that really all I taught you?

20:01.080 --> 20:02.439
Don't you lecture me.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.119
Blue box man flying through
time and space on whimsy.

20:06.920 --> 20:10.039
All I've got, all I've had for 36 years
is cold, hard reality.

20:11.240 --> 20:15.279
So, no, I don't have a sonic screwdriver
because I'm not off on a romp.

20:15.360 --> 20:19.159
I call it what it is. A probe.
And I call my life what it is.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.839
Hell.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.759
Amy Pond, I'm going to put this right.
You said you learned from an interface.

20:27.840 --> 20:28.879
Can I speak with it?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.039
It doesn't work in here.

20:30.120 --> 20:33.399
2:23, the garden will be clear now.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.759
Stay or go?

20:36.960 --> 20:39.079
Sorry, me? No, I'm coming with you.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.999
Then try not to get killed,
or do, whatever.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.679
When I first came here,

20:48.760 --> 20:51.199
I had to trick the interface
into giving me information.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.599
I've reprogrammed it now.

20:52.680 --> 20:55.479
It will tell me anything
except how to escape.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.199
You hacked it? That's genius.

20:57.280 --> 20:59.439
DOCTOR: Sorry to interrupt
that beautiful moment,

20:59.520 --> 21:01.399
but temporal engines like that
have a regulator valve,

21:01.480 --> 21:03.519
has to be kept at a distance
from the main reactor

21:03.600 --> 21:06.679
or there'd be feedback.
Interface, where's the regulator?

21:06.760 --> 21:09.759
AUTOMATED VOICE:
The regulator valve is held within.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.079
Oh, very, very, ah...

21:13.440 --> 21:15.759
Interface, I need to run through
some technical specifications.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.719
Rory, give me to Amy a minute.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.319
Here you go.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.159
They look ridiculous.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.279
That's what I told him.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.439
Still, anything beats a fez, eh?

21:37.520 --> 21:38.759
(LAUGHING)

21:41.880 --> 21:43.039
What is it?

21:46.400 --> 21:49.199
I think that's the first time
I've laughed in 36 years.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.679
I'lljust, um,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.719
leave you two geniuses alone.
I'll be back in a minute.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.159
DOCTOR: There's still time, Amy.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.999
There's still time to fix everything.

22:24.040 --> 22:26.039
How can you have a door without a wall?

22:31.680 --> 22:32.879
-(THUMPS)
-Oh!

22:34.520 --> 22:35.879
Holographic wallpaper?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.159
Oh!

22:40.600 --> 22:43.839
HANDBOT:
Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.

22:47.760 --> 22:49.439
Rory? Rory.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.639
(GROANING)

22:51.440 --> 22:52.679
Glasses.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.559
Stupid!

22:54.800 --> 22:55.959
Oh!

22:57.160 --> 22:59.199
-You saved me.
-Don't get used to it.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.279
You've been crying.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.399
-A little bit.
-Shut up, Rory.

23:03.480 --> 23:04.559
You have, haven't you?

23:04.640 --> 23:06.359
Woman with a sword. Don't push it.

23:06.640 --> 23:07.679
Ha!

23:07.760 --> 23:09.559
Okay. So, here's the plan.

23:09.640 --> 23:12.959
Time is always a bit wibbly-wobbly
but in two streams, it's extra wobbly.

23:13.240 --> 23:14.839
I've worked out a way to hijack
the temporal engines

23:14.920 --> 23:18.079
and use them to fold two points
of Amy's timeline together.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.919
We're bringing her out of the "then"
and into the "now"!

23:22.120 --> 23:23.439
Amy, I just need to
borrow your brain a minute.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.559
It won't hurt, probably.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.879
Almost probably and then,
Amy Pond, I'm going to save you.

23:30.120 --> 23:31.159
No!

23:32.800 --> 23:34.959
Time's up. Handbots coming.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.679
DOCTOR:
Amy, you've got to help us help you.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.439
I need you to think back 36 years ago.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.639
Amy?

23:44.320 --> 23:45.359
Amy!

23:51.760 --> 23:53.479
You told her to leave us a sign.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.319
She did and she waited.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.919
Oh, Amy.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.199
Why won't you help yourself?

24:09.280 --> 24:11.719
He wants to rescue past me
from 36 years back,

24:11.800 --> 24:13.399
which means I'll cease to exist.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.799
Everything I've seen and done dissolves.
Time is rewritten.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.919
That's...

24:17.000 --> 24:18.239
That's good, isn't it?

24:18.320 --> 24:19.439
I will die.

24:19.520 --> 24:20.799
Another Amy will take my place.

24:20.880 --> 24:22.479
An Amy who never got trapped
at Two-Streams,

24:22.560 --> 24:23.879
an Amy who grew old with you.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.839
And she, in 36 years, won't be me.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.919
But you'll die in here!

24:30.440 --> 24:31.799
Not if you take me with you.

24:36.920 --> 24:38.839
You came to rescue me, so rescue me.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.399
Leave her and take you?

24:43.640 --> 24:45.119
We could take this Amy with us easy.

24:45.200 --> 24:48.119
But if we do, our Amy has to wait
36 years to be rescued.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.959
So I have to choose

24:52.040 --> 24:53.839
which wife do I want?

24:54.480 --> 24:57.399
She is me. We're both me.

24:57.480 --> 24:59.159
You being here is wrong.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.799
For a single day, an hour,
let alone a lifetime.

25:05.080 --> 25:06.599
I swore to protect you.

25:07.480 --> 25:08.839
I promised.

25:13.120 --> 25:14.919
-Rory.
-This is your fault.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.399
-I am so sorry, but Rory...
-No, this is your fault!

25:19.840 --> 25:22.279
You should look at a history book
once in a while,

25:22.360 --> 25:23.639
see if there's
an outbreak of plague or not.

25:23.720 --> 25:24.879
That is not how I travel.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.159
Then I do not want to travel with you.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.639
(FEEDBACK WHINING)

25:32.200 --> 25:33.599
(AMY CRYING)

25:44.280 --> 25:47.919
DOCTOR: Rory, if the time glass is
still on, if the link's still active,

25:48.040 --> 25:50.959
I think I can hear Amy. Our Amy.

25:51.560 --> 25:52.799
(AMY CRYING)

25:58.680 --> 25:59.799
Oh, Amy.

26:18.200 --> 26:20.839
Look me in the face
and say you won't help her.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.079
I will not help her.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.039
Okay.

26:42.640 --> 26:44.599
Look me in the face and say it now.

26:44.840 --> 26:45.999
(AMY SOBBING)

26:49.240 --> 26:51.879
AMY: Rory? Rory, is that you?

27:00.320 --> 27:01.519
Rory, where are you?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.119
RORY: Same place as you.
Only I'm a bit ahead.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.999
I remember this.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.639
Who's she?
There's no one else here, but...

27:15.840 --> 27:16.879
Me?

27:30.960 --> 27:32.799
Why are we still here?

27:33.840 --> 27:35.679
Because they leave you here.

27:35.760 --> 27:38.679
Because they get in their Tardis
and they fly away.

27:38.760 --> 27:39.799
No.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.959
Rory wouldn't. Not ever.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.759
Something must have stopped him.

27:45.560 --> 27:46.799
You did.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.479
Or rather, the old version of you.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.599
The me version of you.

27:53.760 --> 27:56.959
I refused to help them.
I won't let them save myself.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.119
Why?

27:59.360 --> 28:02.239
If you escape,
then I was never trapped here.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.359
The last 36 years of my life rewrites
and I cease to exist.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.279
That's why the old me
refused to help then,

28:13.240 --> 28:15.839
that's why I am refusing to help now.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.479
And that's why you'll refuse to help
when it's your turn.

28:20.120 --> 28:23.319
And nothing you can say
will change that.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.399
Three words.

28:27.240 --> 28:28.839
What about Rory?

28:29.320 --> 28:30.439
Rory.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.639
I called my robot Rory.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.839
You called your robot Rory?

28:38.480 --> 28:41.039
Oh, so, you didn't call it The Doctor?

28:41.120 --> 28:44.119
Or Biggles, our favourite cat?

28:44.960 --> 28:46.239
Do you, um...

28:48.320 --> 28:50.639
Do you remember that summer
when he came back to school

28:50.720 --> 28:52.479
with that ridiculous haircut?

28:52.560 --> 28:54.439
He said he'd been in a rock band.

28:57.760 --> 28:58.879
Liar.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.599
And then he had to learn
to play the guitar.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.439
So we would know he couldn't play it.
Mmm-hmm.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.279
All those boys chasing me.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.639
But it was only ever Rory.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.199
Why was that?

29:26.920 --> 29:30.119
You know when sometimes
you meet someone

29:30.200 --> 29:32.079
so beautiful,

29:32.880 --> 29:34.199
and then you actually talk to them

29:34.280 --> 29:36.479
and five minutes later
they're as dull as a brick?

29:38.400 --> 29:41.199
Then there's other people,
and you meet them and you think,

29:41.280 --> 29:42.759
"Not bad. They're okay."

29:44.360 --> 29:46.319
And then, you get to know them

29:47.440 --> 29:50.079
and their face just sort of

29:50.920 --> 29:52.199
becomes them.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.159
Like their personality is
written all over it.

29:56.760 --> 30:01.159
And they just, they turn into something
so beautiful.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.519
BOTH: Rory is the most beautiful man
I have ever met.

30:14.800 --> 30:15.999
Please,

30:17.080 --> 30:18.559
do it for him.

30:18.840 --> 30:19.839
Oh, you...

30:20.560 --> 30:22.759
You're asking me to defy destiny,

30:22.840 --> 30:25.839
causality, the nexus of time itself,
for a boy.

30:27.680 --> 30:29.079
You're Amy.

30:32.280 --> 30:33.639
He's Rory.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.999
Oh, yes I am.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.999
I am going to pull time apart for you.

31:28.440 --> 31:31.079
Okay, Doctor,
Two-Streams is back on air.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.759
Right, okay, so this is big news.

31:32.840 --> 31:36.679
This is temporal earthquake time.
I'm officially changing my own future.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.279
Hold onto your spectacles.

31:38.360 --> 31:41.239
In my past, I saw my future self
refuse to help you.

31:41.320 --> 31:42.879
I am now changing that future
and agreeing.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.439
Every law of time says
that shouldn't be possible.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.519
Yes, except sometimes knowing
your own future

31:47.600 --> 31:48.959
is what enables you to change it.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.999
Especially if you're bloody-minded,
contradictory

31:51.080 --> 31:52.719
and completely unpredictable.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.439
So, basically, if you're Amy, then.

31:54.520 --> 31:58.319
Yes, if anyone could defeat pre-destiny,
it's your wife.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.919
It's not about what I'm doing,
it's about who I'm doing it for.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.239
I am trusting you
to watch my back, Rory.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.519
Always.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.759
-You and me, always.
-Because here is the deal.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.719
You take me, too, in the Tardis.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.199
Me, too.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.519
But that means there'll be
two of you, permanently.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.599
RORY: Forever.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.359
FUTURE AMY:
And that way we both get to live.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.319
Two Amys together. Can that work?

32:25.400 --> 32:27.159
I don't know. It's your marriage.

32:27.240 --> 32:28.439
Doctor!

32:29.640 --> 32:33.719
Perhaps, maybe if I shunted
the reality compensators on the Tardis,

32:33.800 --> 32:38.039
we calibrated the doomsday pumpers
and jettison the karaoke bar, yes,

32:38.360 --> 32:39.679
maybe, yes.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.839
It could do it.
The Tardis could sustain the paradox.

32:43.920 --> 32:45.239
RORY: Right.

32:45.880 --> 32:46.999
Amy.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.399
And Amy.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.759
The wife and the wife. Right.

32:58.280 --> 33:01.199
Okay, Amy, Past Amy, stand by the door.
Future Amy, you, too.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.919
Future Amy, can I borrow
your sonic screw...

33:03.000 --> 33:04.519
It's a probe.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.079
It's a screwdriver.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.439
DOCTOR: Rory, sonic at double-out power.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.999
Amy now, you're our link to Amy then.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.599
We need to get a signal through
and that signal will be a thought.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.719
Amy now and Amy then, share a thought.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.959
Something so powerful
that it can rip through time.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.399
Rory, sonic the pin front.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.359
Inside you will find three levers
and a jumble of wire.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.639
That's the regulator valve.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.399
After we reroute it, you'll have
1 0 minutes to get back to the Tardis.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.119
-Okay.
-Pull out the red and green receptors.

33:28.200 --> 33:30.559
Reroute blue into the red
and the green into the blue.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.559
Leave the red loose,
and on no account touch anything yellow.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.839
Come on, Rory,
it's hardly rocket science.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.959
It's just quantum physics.

33:39.040 --> 33:43.759
Yes, right. Okay, blue into red.
Red into...

33:43.840 --> 33:45.439
Now the levers, throw them in order.

33:45.520 --> 33:47.999
And Amy, start thinking the most
important thought you have ever had.

33:48.080 --> 33:49.959
Hold it in your head
and do not let it go.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.719
Lever one.

33:54.920 --> 33:58.799
-Macarena.
-Macarena.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.119
She's doing the Macarena.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.039
-Macarena.
-Macarena.

34:03.480 --> 34:04.759
Macarena!

34:04.920 --> 34:07.239
-Our first kiss.
-Lever two, Rory.

34:15.480 --> 34:16.559
Lever three!

34:27.960 --> 34:29.039
Oh, Amy!

34:32.200 --> 34:34.279
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God!

34:43.280 --> 34:44.399
(LAUGHING)

34:45.200 --> 34:46.919
Yeah. Sorry.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.319
-Hello.
-Hello.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.599
-I don't know what...
-I don't know what...

34:59.760 --> 35:00.799
Weird.

35:00.960 --> 35:03.199
-Okay, this is weird.
-Okay, this is weird.

35:04.480 --> 35:06.239
-Right, just stop doing that.
-Right, just stop doing that.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.479
How about, Amy 1 speaks first?

35:08.560 --> 35:09.879
-Which one's Amy 1 ?
-Which one's Amy 1 ?

35:09.960 --> 35:11.039
Well, you...

35:11.120 --> 35:12.479
-I am
-I am.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.559
-No, I am.
-No, I am.

35:14.640 --> 35:15.679
-Rory!
-Rory!

35:15.760 --> 35:17.399
-Rory, just stop doing that.
-Rory, just stop doing that.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.559
Ah!

35:18.640 --> 35:21.799
Rory, Rory, take the glasses off.
You'll get temporal feedback.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.999
Whoa! Calm down there, Rory.

35:25.240 --> 35:28.879
Amy, we've created a massive paradox
and the Tardis hates it.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.199
Trying to get out of here.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.559
What's the nasty Amy done to you?

35:34.640 --> 35:36.759
Just calm down there.
Hang on in there, eh?

35:38.160 --> 35:40.799
Rory, you've got eight minutes left.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.639
I'm sorry, you're on your own now.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.519
I'm not on my own.

35:56.480 --> 35:57.879
I've got my wives.

35:58.880 --> 36:00.479
HANDBOT: Do not be alarmed.
RORY: They're coming!

36:00.560 --> 36:02.159
This is a kindness.

36:02.240 --> 36:04.399
-With me.
-Do not be alarmed.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.199
This is a kindness.

36:06.920 --> 36:08.519
-This is a kindness.
-Amy.

36:08.600 --> 36:10.919
-Deactivate.
-Kate Hailer. Year 1 0 hockey.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.319
Go for the shins.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.119
This is a kindness.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.319
RORY: They're cutting off
the departure gate.

36:21.400 --> 36:22.799
We can't get back to the Tardis.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.519
Side door. We'll go behind them.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.199
(ALARM BLARING)

36:26.280 --> 36:28.479
AMY: So you think you're going to
come with us, just like that?

36:28.560 --> 36:29.959
FUTURE AMY: Yeah, just like that.

36:30.040 --> 36:31.879
-Rory, talk to her.
-Rory, talk to her.

36:31.960 --> 36:33.159
Now, ladies.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.439
AMY: Where are you going to live?

36:35.520 --> 36:36.879
FUTURE AMY:
Not with you, don't worry.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.199
I'll go travelling.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.159
Pop back for Christmas, maybe Easter.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.359
Amy, you always said
cooking Christmas dinner,

36:42.440 --> 36:44.279
you wished there were two of you.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.999
Can't we just teleport in?

36:52.080 --> 36:53.559
It's not a teleport, it's a time-jump.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.719
We can't jump
within the same time-stream.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.519
Yes.

36:59.480 --> 37:00.839
The Tardis is in the gallery.

37:02.760 --> 37:04.159
AUTOMATED VOICE: Gallery closed.

37:04.240 --> 37:06.999
The controls are stuck.
They've locked them from the outside.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.159
Can you unlock them?

37:08.240 --> 37:11.039
Yeah, give me a minute
and your cutest smile.

37:11.120 --> 37:12.639
That's the one.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.039
Can you stop flirting with me?

37:16.120 --> 37:18.479
-You're old enough to be my...
-I've known you my whole life.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.679
How many games of doctors and nurses?

37:20.760 --> 37:22.799
-Shh.
-Don't get coy now.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.199
-Um...
-(BANGING)

37:25.280 --> 37:28.679

(GRUNTING)

38:20.240 --> 38:21.919
-Come on!
-Go!

38:22.320 --> 38:23.679
I've got your back.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.439
(SCREAMS)

38:33.120 --> 38:36.279
Do not be alarmed. This is a kindness.

38:49.520 --> 38:50.559
No.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.079
(SHOUTING)

39:25.840 --> 39:28.039
DOCTOR: It's okay, Rory. Here.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.759
Ah, it's just an anaesthetic.
She'll be fine.

39:46.680 --> 39:47.879
I'm sorry.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.079
-What are you doing?
-I lied to her, Rory.

39:51.160 --> 39:52.199
-FUTURE AMY: Doctor!
-There can never be

39:52.280 --> 39:53.759
two Amys in the Tardis.
The paradox would be too massive.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.279
You can't leave her, she'll die!

39:55.360 --> 39:57.279
-Doctor, let me in.
-No. She'll never have existed.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.839
When we save our Amy,
this future won't have happened.

39:59.920 --> 40:01.839
-She happened. She's there!
-FUTURE AMY: Doctor, please!

40:01.920 --> 40:03.159
I trusted you!

40:03.240 --> 40:05.839
-No, she's not real.
-She is real. Let her in.

40:05.920 --> 40:07.599
Look, if we take this Amy,
we leave ours.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.799
There can only be one Amy in the Tardis.
Which one do you want?

40:13.840 --> 40:15.239
It's your choice.

40:20.400 --> 40:24.119
This isn't fair.
You're turning me into you.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.119
-Your choice, Rory.
-(STUTTERS) I...

40:26.800 --> 40:28.159
(FUTURE AMY BANGS ON DOOR)

40:28.240 --> 40:30.199
FUTURE AMY: Doctor! Doctor!

40:31.680 --> 40:33.639
Doctor! Doctor!

40:41.600 --> 40:43.959
Rory, please.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.239
The look on your face
when you carried her...

40:54.080 --> 40:55.119
me,

40:56.720 --> 40:57.799
her,

40:58.480 --> 41:00.519
when you carried her away,

41:00.880 --> 41:03.199
you used to look at me like that.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.959
I'd forgotten how much you loved me.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.799
I'd forgotten
how much I love being her,

41:13.480 --> 41:15.639
the Amy Pond in the Tardis

41:17.800 --> 41:18.999
with Rory Williams.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.799
(SOBBING)
I'm sorry. I can't deal with this.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.079
If you love me, don't let me in.

41:36.920 --> 41:40.599
Open that door, I will.
I will come in. I don't want to die.

41:40.680 --> 41:42.199
I won't bow out bravely.

41:42.280 --> 41:45.319
I'll be kicking, screaming, fighting

41:47.400 --> 41:48.759
to the end.

41:50.520 --> 41:51.599
Amy.

41:53.480 --> 41:56.439
-Amy, I love you.
-I love you, too.

41:57.840 --> 41:58.999
(SNIFFLES)

41:59.400 --> 42:00.599
Don't let me in.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.159
Tell Amy,

42:05.240 --> 42:08.479
your Amy, I'm giving her the days.

42:10.880 --> 42:11.959
The days with you.

42:13.520 --> 42:14.759
Days to come.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.919
I'm so, so sorry.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.319
The days I can't have.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.879
Take them, please.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.159
-I'm giving you my days.
-I'm so, so sorry.

43:11.640 --> 43:12.879
Show me home.

43:20.520 --> 43:23.239
Did I ever tell you about this boy
I met there

43:26.400 --> 43:28.159
who pretended to be in a band?

43:29.440 --> 43:31.639
(HANDBOTS APPROACHING)

43:52.720 --> 43:54.519
(TARDIS WHOOSHING)

44:06.320 --> 44:08.999
Did you always know it would never work,

44:09.120 --> 44:10.759
saving both Amys?

44:13.680 --> 44:16.319
I promised you I'd save her,
and there she is.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.519
Safe.

44:22.720 --> 44:23.839
Yeah,

44:24.840 --> 44:25.919
there she is.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.959
I'll leave you two alone.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.039
-You all right?
-Mmm-hmm.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.759
-How are you feeling?
-Where is she?

45:00.200 --> 45:03.119
The rooms have things in them.

45:04.520 --> 45:05.559
(SCREAMS)

45:05.640 --> 45:08.439
There's a room here
for everyone, Doctor,

45:08.600 --> 45:09.919
even you.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.919
We're going to catch ourselves
a monster.

45:16.600 --> 45:18.639
Here comes the candle
to light you to bed.

45:19.880 --> 45:22.279
Here comes the chopper
to chop off your head.

45:22.720 --> 45:27.319
Chop!
