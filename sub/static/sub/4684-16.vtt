WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:04.900
No, no, no.
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.966 --> 00:07.733
Here's what's
on my mind tonight.

00:10.066 --> 00:12.566
Kim found a kinky way

00:10.066 --> 00:12.566
to spice up her marriage.

00:12.633 --> 00:15.166
I can feel your fingers now
touching my thigh.

00:15.233 --> 00:18.233
And her husband found
a naughty way to make money.

00:18.300 --> 00:21.200
You should record
a 9-7-6 number.

00:21.266 --> 00:24.733
But their dirty little games
inspired murder.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.866
Your fantasy message
is arousing

00:26.933 --> 00:28.466
some whacko out there.

00:28.533 --> 00:31.766
And Kim's fantasy has turned
into a real nightmare.

00:31.833 --> 00:34.533
On the next
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.100 --> 00:59.566
You are in Springwood now,
and you're all mine.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.733
Kim?

01:42.800 --> 01:44.000
- Oh.
- Are you alright?

01:44.066 --> 01:45.966
No, David,
I didn't even hear you come in.

01:46.033 --> 01:48.700
You really looked out of it.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.733
Ah. I was thinking about
a-a scene I was gonna write.

01:51.800 --> 01:54.300
Oh. How's it coming?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.000
I don't, I don't know.

01:58.200 --> 02:01.033
I mean, I've never written
a novel before, I-I..

02:01.100 --> 02:02.600
I think I need
somebody else's opinion.

02:02.666 --> 02:04.700
I-I-I'm not sure
if this makes any sense.

02:04.766 --> 02:07.000
Do not look at me.
I got a marketing midterm

02:07.066 --> 02:09.033
first thing in the morning

02:13.166 --> 02:15.533
So is that all
you have time to do? Study?

02:15.600 --> 02:19.366
Hey, honey, my career was going

02:15.600 --> 02:19.366
nowhere without an MBA.

02:19.433 --> 02:22.533
If I'm gonna get an MBA,
I've got to study. Yes.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.066
Come on, David.

02:25.500 --> 02:28.533
I don't believe you. All you can
think about is sex these days.

02:29.766 --> 02:31.700
It used to be
all you thought about.

02:33.533 --> 02:35.733
What happened to that horny guy
I married, huh?

02:35.800 --> 02:37.433
He enrolled in graduate school.

02:37.500 --> 02:38.733
You know, I'll tell you
something, between the full load

02:38.800 --> 02:40.333
of classes I'm taking
and attending bar

02:40.400 --> 02:42.533
at that faculty club,
I'm about to drop.

02:44.633 --> 02:46.766
This is ridiculous.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.233
I-i-it's just not fair
that I-I stay home and write.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.733
I'm on sabbatical
for this novel.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.100
I-I don't even know
if it's gonna make any money..

02:55.133 --> 02:56.166
I'm gonna start teaching again.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.266
I-I'm sure I can get
my old position back.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.100
No! No, you take the semester
off to finish the novel.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.133
You're gonna finish it.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.466
David.

03:08.533 --> 03:09.666
David, you haven't
made love to me

03:09.733 --> 03:12.133
since I stopped
bringing home my paycheck.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.300
What is this, some sort
of a Freudian connection there?

03:14.366 --> 03:15.866
No, I'm serious.

03:15.933 --> 03:18.100
I-it's just
we're never together anymore.

03:18.166 --> 03:21.333
You know, you're either
too tired or...too busy.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.733
I miss you.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.833
Mm. Hmm.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.500
Kim? Kim. Come on.

03:29.566 --> 03:31.666
Come on, honey.
Honey. Honey. Come on.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.166
Don't get me started.

03:34.233 --> 03:37.033
I don't think
that's possible anymore.

03:50.533 --> 03:53.166
What's wrong with that guy?

03:53.233 --> 03:56.400
I guess he doesn't want
to be a sex symbol.

03:56.466 --> 03:59.633
Maybe that's what happens
when you study too hard.

03:59.700 --> 04:02.666
Well, if he won't give her
what she wants

04:02.733 --> 04:04.300
maybe I will.

04:04.366 --> 04:07.200
I'm the kind of guy that, uh,
her dreams are made of.

04:07.266 --> 04:10.200
You know, uh, tall and..

04:10.266 --> 04:12.700
...dark..

04:12.766 --> 04:14.433
...burned to a crisp.

04:48.266 --> 04:50.700
"Tanya could feel
his hot breath on her neck.

04:50.766 --> 04:53.500
"As she turned to face him,
Michael fell to his knees.

04:54.633 --> 04:57.300
"He placed a hand
between her legs.

04:57.366 --> 04:58.900
"Before she could say no

04:58.966 --> 05:01.866
"he had unsnapped
her garter belt.

05:01.933 --> 05:04.600
"He moved her stockings slowly

05:04.666 --> 05:05.900
"pausing to caress her thigh

05:05.966 --> 05:08.233
"with his long, firm fingers.

05:09.766 --> 05:11.633
"Once it was off

05:11.700 --> 05:15.833
"Michael brushed the soft silk
across Tanya's eyes.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.733
"Continued running the silk
down her cheek and neck

05:19.800 --> 05:22.500
to the top
of her glistening breasts."

05:51.033 --> 05:52.300
Hello?

05:53.300 --> 05:54.833
'Hello?'

05:56.333 --> 05:57.933
- 'Hello?'
- Hi.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.600
Who is this?

06:04.766 --> 06:06.533
What number are you callin'?

06:07.266 --> 06:08.500
Yours.

06:10.433 --> 06:12.400
Would you like to know
what I'm wearing?

06:14.333 --> 06:15.533
Uh, not really.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.200
'Silk stockings.'

06:18.533 --> 06:21.233
'Have you ever taken off
a pair of silk stockings?'

06:22.666 --> 06:24.033
Feels good.

06:25.433 --> 06:29.066
I can feel your fingers
now touching my thigh

06:29.133 --> 06:31.100
caressing my legs.

06:33.566 --> 06:35.533
You're so gentle.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.333
'Oh, I'm starting
to tingle you.'

06:42.166 --> 06:43.633
Who is this?

06:48.233 --> 06:50.200
Would you like me
to keep going?

06:51.333 --> 06:52.900
I'm still here.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.533
Tell me what you want me to do.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.100
What do you mean?

07:03.166 --> 07:05.133
What's your fantasy?

07:06.766 --> 07:08.200
My fantasy?

07:10.866 --> 07:13.566
'Guess my fantasy would be'

07:13.633 --> 07:18.200
'to be lying naked
in...front of a fire'

07:18.266 --> 07:21.233
'making love
to a sensuous woman'

07:22.833 --> 07:24.933
wrapped in a fur rug..

07:26.066 --> 07:28.533
...a jar of...honey..

07:30.300 --> 07:31.933
I'm starting to tingle you

07:33.033 --> 07:36.033
Wh.. It was you?

07:36.100 --> 07:38.033
Who did you think it was?

07:39.200 --> 07:40.400
I, uh..

07:41.633 --> 07:43.133
Uh..

08:03.100 --> 08:06.200
I still can't believe
that was your voice.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.266
I never knew you could
sound so seductive.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.000
Mm, neither did I.

08:10.066 --> 08:11.966
I guess desperation
is the mother of invention

08:12.033 --> 08:13.200
Hmm.

08:13.266 --> 08:15.700
I'm just glad it achieved
the desired effect.

08:15.766 --> 08:17.433
Oh, it did more than that.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.600
- I got an idea.
- What kind of an idea?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.566
I think..

08:21.633 --> 08:23.033
...you should record..

08:23.100 --> 08:25.200
...a 9-7-6 number.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
Sorry, David.
I don't do obscene phone calls.

08:30.066 --> 08:32.933
No, not obscene.
Just a little erotic.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.500
And you wouldn't be
making the call

08:34.566 --> 08:36.000
it would be a recorded message.

08:36.066 --> 08:37.933
Are you serious about this?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.033
Hey, some guys get off on this--

08:40.100 --> 08:42.200
- David!
- Honey, listen to me.

08:42.266 --> 08:43.866
It's been all over the news.

08:43.933 --> 08:44.866
I'm telling you,
there's an incredible

08:44.933 --> 08:46.900
profit potential in this.

08:47.566 --> 08:48.866
One good message..

08:48.933 --> 08:51.233
...could practically pay
for my entire tuition.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.333
It is an incredible opportunity.

08:56.633 --> 08:58.233
I think it's still perverted.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.600
Ah, it's a little perverted.

08:59.666 --> 09:01.633
Come on, it's a business.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.466
And possibly
a very lucrative one.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.700
And no one is gonna know
it's you.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.033
And...it could be kind of fun.

09:16.566 --> 09:19.300
I can't believe I'm letting you
talk me into this.

09:24.866 --> 09:26.033
'I've got a surprise for you.'

09:26.100 --> 09:27.033
'What?'

09:28.566 --> 09:31.533
This is our first check
from the phone company.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.700
Oh.

09:35.733 --> 09:37.333
"Seven hundred
and forty three dollars?"

09:37.400 --> 09:40.233
It's just the first week.
You're a hit!

09:40.300 --> 09:43.066
"Seven hundred and forty three
dollars" in one week?

09:43.133 --> 09:46.300
Oh, that is, uh,
that is tuition.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.700
But if you play
your cards right

09:48.766 --> 09:50.200
I might take you out
for a beach.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.800
Hmm.

09:55.133 --> 09:56.933
- Mr. and Mrs. Lewis?
- 'Yes'

09:57.000 --> 09:59.133
Tony Ross, Springwood PD.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.100
Okay if I come in?

10:02.166 --> 10:04.500
Yeah, sure. Come on in.

10:04.566 --> 10:06.433
'What, what brings you here,
detective?'

10:06.500 --> 10:08.800
It's not every day
a police officer--

10:08.866 --> 10:11.400
Well, I'd...like to ask yo
a few questions

10:11.466 --> 10:13.733
about a young woman
named Allison Drought.

10:14.866 --> 10:16.366
Is she one of your
former students?

10:16.433 --> 10:19.400
Mmm. No, no, I've never seen her
before in my life.

10:19.466 --> 10:22.633
Who, who is she? I mean, why
would you think we would know?

10:22.700 --> 10:25.100
Well, she was murdered
two nights ago.

10:26.333 --> 10:27.866
And we found this in her purse.

10:27.933 --> 10:29.400
'Oh, my God.'

10:30.266 --> 10:31.533
Oh, it could be nothing.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.300
We see these things
all the time.

10:34.366 --> 10:36.233
'And your latest 9-7-6 message'

10:36.300 --> 10:38.466
'talks about how it feels
to have a silk stocking'

10:38.533 --> 10:40.500
'around your neck and face.'

10:42.266 --> 10:44.733
She was strangled
with a silk stocking.

10:58.600 --> 11:00.733
You're the reason
my daughter's dead.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.200
Your daughter?

11:03.266 --> 11:05.433
You and your filthy mind!

11:05.500 --> 11:07.733
Your kinky messages.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.666
I-it wasn't my fault.
I didn't kill anyone.

11:10.733 --> 11:13.166
Your tape made some pervert

11:13.233 --> 11:16.133
brutally murder my only child.

11:17.100 --> 11:18.900
- Do you have children?
- No.

11:18.966 --> 11:20.833
I hope someday you do.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.566
I hope you have
the most adorable little girl.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.933
So she could die
like my little girl!

11:36.833 --> 11:38.333
You alright?

11:41.633 --> 11:42.900
Sweetheart?

11:43.733 --> 11:45.500
Honey?

11:45.566 --> 11:47.033
Honey, I know
what you're thinking

11:47.100 --> 11:49.666
but the fact that the flye
was found on that woman

11:49.733 --> 11:51.066
was purely coincidental.

11:51.133 --> 11:52.833
We had nothing to do
with her death.

11:52.900 --> 11:55.166
Well, that doesn't stop me
from feeling guilty as sin.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.233
And that's what we did, David.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.533
We sinned.
And now we're being punished.

11:58.600 --> 11:59.833
Hey! Let's not overreact here.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.033
We didn't do anything illegal.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.866
Detective Ross.

12:10.933 --> 12:13.300
Sorry to bother you, folks,

12:13.366 --> 12:15.700
but we just found
another victim.

12:17.366 --> 12:18.900
'She had a flyer?'

12:18.966 --> 12:19.933
'In her pocket.'

12:20.000 --> 12:22.300
'Exact same MO.'

12:22.366 --> 12:24.300
- Silk stocking?
- You got it.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.666
Obviously,
your fantasy message

12:27.733 --> 12:30.833
is arousing some whacko
out there.

12:30.900 --> 12:32.900
I think you'd be doing
all of us a big favor

12:32.966 --> 12:34.900
if you just took it
off your machine.

12:34.966 --> 12:37.533
You don't have to say
anything more. It's gone.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.533
'Appreciate the cooperation.'

12:41.833 --> 12:43.333
I'm so sorry.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.600
We didn't dream
that this would happen.

12:47.666 --> 12:50.233
It was a joke.
We didn't wanna hurt anybody.

12:51.766 --> 12:53.733
I know that, Mrs. Lewis.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.700
No one's blaming you.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.333
'I gotta get back
to the station.'

13:01.400 --> 13:03.800
If there's anything
we can do to help..

13:05.266 --> 13:07.233
Oh, I'll be in touch.

13:10.666 --> 13:11.933
Honey.

13:14.433 --> 13:17.333
I can't believe I ever let you
do this to me!

13:33.733 --> 13:34.666
Hello?

13:34.733 --> 13:35.800
'This message..'

13:35.866 --> 13:37.700
'Why did you cancel
the old message?'

13:37.766 --> 13:39.000
'I need to hear your voice.'

13:39.066 --> 13:40.766
'I wanna tingle, dammit!
Make me tingle.'

13:40.833 --> 13:42.300
There is no message!

13:43.566 --> 13:46.733
'Why don't you take off...
the other stocking?'

14:18.200 --> 14:19.633
David?

15:04.033 --> 15:05.533
Ah!

15:24.333 --> 15:26.233
David Lewis, please.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.600
'Hello?'

15:28.666 --> 15:31.366
- David, uh, it's Kim. I..
- 'What's wrong?'

15:31.433 --> 15:33.600
I had one of those nightmares
again and..

15:33.666 --> 15:36.333
I know I sound paranoid,
but, um..

15:36.400 --> 15:39.066
I am. I-I-I don't think
I can han..

15:39.133 --> 15:40.566
Can you come home please?

15:40.633 --> 15:41.833
'Honey, I want you to relax.'

15:41.900 --> 15:43.666
'I just finished,
and I'm on my way.'

15:43.733 --> 15:44.766
- Okay.
- 'Wait, Kim?'

15:44.833 --> 15:46.100
What?

15:46.166 --> 15:48.066
'Make sure the elevator doors
are locked, alright?'

15:48.133 --> 15:49.833
'And I'll see you
in ten minutes.'

15:49.900 --> 15:51.233
- Okay.
- 'I love you.'

15:51.300 --> 15:52.733
I love you too.

16:30.266 --> 16:31.533
Who's there?

16:31.600 --> 16:32.900
'Detective Ross, ma'am.'

16:32.966 --> 16:35.333
'If it's a bad time,
I can come back.'

16:35.400 --> 16:37.533
Uh, no. No, no, no.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.400
Come on in.

16:45.433 --> 16:46.366
I'm sorry to bother you.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.833
No bother at all.
I'm glad you're here.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.500
Especially if you came to tell
me you caught the killer.

16:51.566 --> 16:52.900
I wish I could.

16:52.966 --> 16:55.500
But the truth is I came by
to ask for your help.

16:56.566 --> 16:57.566
You see they're really
short-handed

16:57.633 --> 17:00.200
down at the station, and..

17:00.266 --> 17:01.500
And they're gonna take me
off this case

17:01.566 --> 17:03.633
if I don't come up
with any new leads.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.033
I think I might be able
to recognize the killer's voice.

17:10.900 --> 17:12.433
Oh, yeah? How?

17:15.833 --> 17:18.700
Well, um, I-I suppose
it's my guilty conscience.

17:18.766 --> 17:20.633
I-I don't know, but in-in, um..

17:20.700 --> 17:22.900
...one of my dreams..

17:22.966 --> 17:24.933
...he called me.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.000
What am I talkin'..
I'm sorry, detective.

17:29.266 --> 17:32.066
I'm having
a hard time separating

17:32.133 --> 17:35.766
fantasy from, uh,
reality these days.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.500
Oh...no, these dreams sound
pretty interesting.

17:38.566 --> 17:40.966
You wanna talk about 'em?

17:41.033 --> 17:44.000
You wanna play shrink?

17:44.066 --> 17:46.533
I took a few psych courses
in college.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.133
You never know,
you might remember something.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.000
Some clue.

17:50.066 --> 17:52.933
Okay, um, let me just put on
some warmer clothes

17:53.000 --> 17:54.700
before we start.

17:54.766 --> 17:55.900
It is a little nippy in here.

17:55.966 --> 17:57.766
Yeah, I was just
about to light a fire.

17:57.833 --> 18:00.200
Oh. I'll do that.
You go get dressed.

18:00.266 --> 18:01.600
Okay.

18:22.033 --> 18:23.400
Hello?

18:24.033 --> 18:25.733
Hello?

18:28.633 --> 18:30.700
'I'm starting to tingle.'

18:30.766 --> 18:32.133
'Are you?'

18:58.033 --> 18:59.466
'All circuits are busy.'

18:59.533 --> 19:02.033
'Please hang up and try again.'

20:00.133 --> 20:01.400
Kim!

20:04.000 --> 20:05.300
Kim!

20:08.900 --> 20:10.233
Kim!

20:30.566 --> 20:33.533
Say something.
I wanna hear you talk.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.933
- What?
- Not like that!

20:38.266 --> 20:40.633
Like Tania talks.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.533
- I can't.
- Do it!

20:43.433 --> 20:45.466
- No!
- Do it, you slut!

21:30.633 --> 21:32.200
It's over.

21:35.333 --> 21:36.800
It's over.

21:40.266 --> 21:44.000
Who says there's never a cop
around when you need one.

21:44.066 --> 21:46.333
Ha ha.

21:46.400 --> 21:49.466
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:49.533 --> 21:52.466
You have the right
to an attorney!

21:52.533 --> 21:55.466
You have the right to die!

22:02.933 --> 22:04.900
Why won't they let me

22:02.933 --> 22:04.900
out of here?

22:06.766 --> 22:09.033
Can't they see I'm not insane?

22:11.866 --> 22:13.533
It's my husband's fault.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.200
He is the one who's insane.

22:15.266 --> 22:17.100
He's the one
who should be in here.

22:17.166 --> 22:18.433
Not me!

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
It's my husband's fault!

22:20.566 --> 22:22.866
'Don't you thinkyou're getting
a little overly dramatic here?'

22:22.933 --> 22:25.400
I mean, this is
really dark stuff.

22:25.466 --> 22:27.100
Give me that, David.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.766
What's wrong?

22:28.833 --> 22:30.666
Just wanted to find out what
happened to Tania and Michael.

22:30.733 --> 22:33.533
- They're great characters.
- Oh, don't patronize me.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.433
And don't ever let me catch you
looking at my manuscript again.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.733
Do you understand that? Never!

22:39.800 --> 22:41.400
Or I swear to God..

22:42.600 --> 22:45.000
...I don't know what I'll do.

22:45.066 --> 22:47.866
Why is there such a secret
all of a sudden?

22:47.933 --> 22:50.633
Kim, you're not being
rational. We're married.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.133
We shouldn't have to hide
things from each other.

22:54.533 --> 22:55.500
Where're you going?

22:55.566 --> 22:56.500
I don't wanna be here when that

22:56.566 --> 22:58.633
idiot shrink shows up.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.100
Listen, Dr. Richards
happens to be

23:00.166 --> 23:01.733
one of the best
psychiatrists around.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.200
We're lucky he's seeing us.

23:03.266 --> 23:05.700
Give me a break, David.
The guy's a jerk!

23:07.266 --> 23:08.566
You're gonna be home for dinner?

23:08.633 --> 23:10.600
What difference does it make?

23:21.233 --> 23:23.866
'What's taking so long?'

23:23.933 --> 23:26.233
Where's that script?

23:27.866 --> 23:29.466
I-I hope you like it,
Mr. Krueger.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.000
Oh, let's see now..

23:32.066 --> 23:36.100
"Interior loft day.
David meets doctor."

23:36.166 --> 23:38.733
Oh, very dramatic.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.766
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.600
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!

23:43.666 --> 23:44.633
Blah, blah, blah!

23:48.966 --> 23:52.100
Sorry, uh, heh heh,
uh, good work

23:52.166 --> 23:55.700
really, uh, my people
will call your people, uh.

23:55.766 --> 23:58.466
It's really, a,
a very good script.

23:58.533 --> 24:00.166
Thanks, Mr. Krueger.

24:00.233 --> 24:03.266
Especially when I add
a few, uh, twists of my own.

24:03.333 --> 24:04.766
Know what I mean?

24:09.966 --> 24:11.933
Well, then watch.

24:17.566 --> 24:19.266
I can't thank you enough
for coming, doctor.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.600
Oh, I don't mind.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.300
Actually, I rather enjoy
getting out of the office.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
How've things been
since we spoke?

24:26.466 --> 24:30.633
Oh, last couple days, it's been
mood swing central around here.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.666
I never know who
I'm gonna be dealing with.

24:32.733 --> 24:35.300
Kim, my loving wife or..

24:35.366 --> 24:37.800
Or her sullen,
vindictive alter ego.

24:37.866 --> 24:39.500
Exactly.

24:39.566 --> 24:41.233
Well, it's not surprising
that your wife harbors

24:41.300 --> 24:43.666
a certain amount
of latent hostility.

24:43.733 --> 24:45.366
After all, it was
a police officer

24:45.433 --> 24:48.266
a man that society has taught
us that we could trust

24:48.333 --> 24:52.100
that broke into your home
and...assaulted your wife.

24:52.166 --> 24:55.066
Uh, could I...trouble you
for some honey?

24:55.133 --> 24:57.100
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.800
Here you go.

25:06.866 --> 25:08.500
Thank you.

25:08.566 --> 25:12.566
From what I observed,
it appears that subconsciously

25:12.633 --> 25:15.433
Kim holds you responsible
for everything that's happened.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.033
Uh, doctor, I admit
the whole thing was my fault.

25:18.100 --> 25:21.033
She knows that. How many times
do I have to tell her I'm sorry?

25:21.100 --> 25:25.200
Trust...is a very difficult
thing to rebuild, David.

25:25.266 --> 25:29.233
Doctor, I will do
whatever it takes.

25:29.300 --> 25:32.133
Believe me, I just,
I just want her to be well.

26:53.466 --> 26:54.700
Hi.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.800
Oh, you went shopping, eh?

27:01.366 --> 27:03.433
- What'd you buy?
- Nothing.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.100
Uh, you hungry? I can reheat..

27:07.166 --> 27:09.100
I'm going to bed.

27:31.966 --> 27:36.033
"Tania smiled as she heard the

27:31.966 --> 27:36.033
groan of the arriving elevator.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.766
"She warmed herself in
the stream of bright sunlight

27:38.833 --> 27:42.166
"that poured through the
enormous windows of the loft.

27:42.233 --> 27:44.933
"Memories flooding her head.

27:45.000 --> 27:48.600
"A raging torrent
of highly charged emotions

27:49.566 --> 27:51.600
on the verge of eruption."

28:00.600 --> 28:02.533
- Tania?
- Yes.

28:04.900 --> 28:08.500
Nick Charles, Springwood PD.

28:08.566 --> 28:10.033
You called about a burglary?

28:10.100 --> 28:12.033
Yes, come in, detective.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.933
You know, you look like a cop.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.400
Oh, yeah? How's that?

28:27.400 --> 28:30.100
Mm, you look like..

28:30.166 --> 28:32.566
...a man a woman can trust

28:32.633 --> 28:35.433
Tell that to my wife.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.633
As a rule, I don't feel
very secure around policemen.

28:40.700 --> 28:41.633
Really?

28:41.700 --> 28:43.133
But I can already tell

28:43.200 --> 28:45.900
it's not the case with you

28:45.966 --> 28:48.266
I feel very safe now.

28:48.333 --> 28:51.000
Uh, about that burglary..

28:52.100 --> 28:54.100
What was taken?

28:54.166 --> 28:56.566
I'm not sure.

28:56.633 --> 28:58.733
Why don't we check the bedroom?

29:02.633 --> 29:04.600
There is no burglary,
is there, Tania?

29:06.166 --> 29:08.300
'Are you trying to seduce me?'

29:19.666 --> 29:21.700
Aren't you coming to bed?

29:21.766 --> 29:23.433
Uh, in a minute.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.933
I don't think
I can wait that long.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.300
What's gotten into you?

29:47.366 --> 29:49.400
Shh.

29:49.466 --> 29:50.933
Don't talk.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.633
Come here.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.500
Would you like to help, David?

30:55.466 --> 30:56.733
Good morning.

31:00.033 --> 31:02.266
What's the matter?
What did I say?

31:02.333 --> 31:03.500
I love your attitude.

31:03.566 --> 31:05.433
It's so cavalier.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.766
- What are you talking about?
- Don't touch me.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.333
You've manhandled me
for the last time, Michael.

31:12.066 --> 31:13.800
What did you call me?

31:13.866 --> 31:16.300
Kim...we gotta talk right now.

31:16.366 --> 31:17.700
You're freaking out.

31:17.766 --> 31:18.733
Ow!

31:27.466 --> 31:28.766
Hello?

31:28.833 --> 31:30.500
'Yeah, Mr. Lewis,
this is Captain Shaw'

31:30.566 --> 31:31.833
'over at the police department.'

31:31.900 --> 31:32.900
Yes.

31:32.966 --> 31:34.166
'I'm sorry to bother you,
Mr. Lewis'

31:34.233 --> 31:36.133
'but, uh,
I'm trying to determine'

31:36.200 --> 31:37.366
'the whereabouts
of one of my men.'

31:37.433 --> 31:39.000
'Detective Nick Charles.'

31:40.933 --> 31:44.166
Nick Charles, Springwood PD.

31:44.233 --> 31:46.166
'He was last seen just prior
to answering'

31:46.233 --> 31:47.766
'a call at your address.'

31:47.833 --> 31:49.533
Mmm, you look like..

31:50.500 --> 31:52.433
...a man a woman can trust

31:54.166 --> 31:57.100
He, uh, he must've talked
to my wife.

32:00.633 --> 32:02.900
Uh, I'll-I'll talk to her

32:02.966 --> 32:05.500
and-and-and get back to you
as soon as I can, captain.

32:05.566 --> 32:07.633
'Alright, now, I appreciate it,
Mr. Lewis.'

32:07.700 --> 32:08.800
'So long now.'

32:08.866 --> 32:09.833
Right.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.866
"Tania rose with the sun.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.866
"Took a long,
hot shower and vowed

32:43.933 --> 32:47.200
"that Michael had raped her
for the last time.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.700
"But her plans for him
would have to wait.

32:49.766 --> 32:51.266
"This morning, the task at hand

32:51.333 --> 32:53.900
"was to get rid
of the body in the trunk

32:53.966 --> 32:55.733
"before the garage
began to smell

32:55.800 --> 32:58.200
of decaying human flesh."

33:06.200 --> 33:07.666
- Dr. Richards.
- David.

33:07.733 --> 33:10.833
I didn't expect to see you.
Would you tell Kim I'm here.

33:10.900 --> 33:13.733
Uh, she's not here.
She just walked out.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.300
Really? That's two sessions
in a row she's missed.

33:16.366 --> 33:18.433
What-what do you mean
missed two sessions?

33:18.500 --> 33:20.666
She saw you yesterday,
didn't she?

33:20.733 --> 33:22.300
She wasn't here when I came.

33:22.366 --> 33:25.366
I-I waited the entire hour.
She never showed.

33:25.433 --> 33:27.066
Doctor, has-has Kim
ever talked to you

33:27.133 --> 33:28.466
about the novel she's writing?

33:28.533 --> 33:29.966
Nothing other than just say that

33:30.033 --> 33:31.500
it was going well.

33:31.566 --> 33:34.900
That she was really getting into
the head of the main character.

33:34.966 --> 33:37.900
Yes, literally gotten into
the head of the main character.

33:37.966 --> 33:40.066
I think she's assumed
the personality of Tania

33:40.133 --> 33:41.566
the heroine of her novel.

33:41.633 --> 33:43.733
David, you're-you're-you'r
on the wrong track.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.500
Listen to me,
listen to me, this book

33:45.566 --> 33:49.266
started out as a,
a light romantic adventure

33:49.333 --> 33:50.933
Since the assault,
it's-it's turned

33:51.000 --> 33:52.733
into a macabre killing spree.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.166
Her mood has grown darker,
but it seems only natural

33:55.233 --> 33:57.666
that her fiction
reflect those changes.

33:57.733 --> 33:59.966
Doctor, she is losing
touch with reality.

34:00.033 --> 34:02.800
She's living in a fantasy world.

34:02.866 --> 34:05.066
Can you tell me anything that
you, you two have talked about?

34:05.133 --> 34:07.033
David, that's privileged
information.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.733
'Even for husbands.'

34:09.866 --> 34:11.000
'I gotta go back to the office.'

34:11.066 --> 34:13.633
Uh, when Kim comes in,
have her give me a call.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.866
"Tania thought
about the doctor.

34:36.933 --> 34:39.566
"In fact, she thought
about him a lot.

34:39.633 --> 34:41.533
"She knew she wanted him.

34:41.600 --> 34:44.100
She wanted him
in more ways than one."

34:45.366 --> 34:47.533
Tell me something,
Tania, why do you harbor

34:47.600 --> 34:49.933
such a deep resentment
towards your husband?

34:51.733 --> 34:54.033
Because he's a sick pervert,
that's why.

34:55.033 --> 34:56.500
Didn't he tell you
what he made me do?

34:59.066 --> 35:01.100
Why don't you tell me?

35:04.433 --> 35:08.733
Doctor...do you like to listen
to girls talk dirty?

35:11.500 --> 35:13.000
I thought so.

35:13.066 --> 35:15.200
Just as horny as the next guy,
aren't you?

35:17.833 --> 35:21.333
Oh, doctor.
You're make me feel so hot

35:23.633 --> 35:25.433
I can feel your eyes.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.700
And they see
right through my clothes.

35:29.166 --> 35:32.133
But seeing isn't...
quite enough, is it?

35:35.100 --> 35:37.066
You want to fondle

35:37.133 --> 35:40.266
and bite...and touch

35:40.333 --> 35:42.233
don't you, doctor?

35:42.300 --> 35:45.933
You want it so bad
that you can't stand it.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.933
In fact, you're gonna explode
any minute.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.933
Good morning, honey.

36:42.733 --> 36:43.966
Gee, you look tired.

36:44.033 --> 36:46.233
Are you sure
you're getting enough sleep?

36:46.300 --> 36:48.566
Why don't you stay home
from school today?

36:48.633 --> 36:49.833
We could go out to lunch.
We haven't done that

36:49.900 --> 36:51.333
in a long time.

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
Tell you what?

36:52.466 --> 36:54.266
I'll think of some place
really nice to go

36:54.333 --> 36:55.733
and I'll call you later.

36:56.666 --> 36:59.433
Oh, say hi to Ira for me.

37:01.100 --> 37:02.233
Ira?

37:02.300 --> 37:03.833
'Mm, Dr. Richards.'

37:03.900 --> 37:06.900
I'm so glad you convinced me
to go back into therapy.

37:06.966 --> 37:09.333
He's made such a differenc
in my life.

37:09.400 --> 37:12.433
He's just so warm
and caring and..

37:12.500 --> 37:14.400
...aware of what
I'm going through.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.933
- Mm.
- I'll see you later.

37:19.733 --> 37:21.400
Oh, have a good session.

37:42.700 --> 37:46.233
"Ira could feel the blood
throbbing in his temples.

37:46.300 --> 37:48.633
"He marveled at her stamina..

37:48.700 --> 37:50.600
"...and his own.

37:50.666 --> 37:53.233
"He'd not been called up on
to perform at this level

37:53.300 --> 37:55.933
"since his days
at theuniversity.

37:57.566 --> 38:01.600
But he knew that one more time
would be pushing his luck."

38:03.933 --> 38:06.833
Oh, Ira. Why did you stop?

38:08.033 --> 38:09.866
Your husband will be home soon.

38:09.933 --> 38:12.300
Oh, that's why I need you
to stay here with me

38:12.366 --> 38:15.200
to protect me from him.

38:15.266 --> 38:18.633
Oh, you have no idea
how cruel he treats me.

38:18.700 --> 38:20.800
Like I was nothing more
than a slut.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.566
I know he's a monster.

38:23.666 --> 38:26.500
I'll never be safe.

38:26.566 --> 38:29.733
I'll never really...
be well again..

38:32.666 --> 38:34.033
...until he's dead.

38:41.700 --> 38:42.933
What are you saying?

38:43.766 --> 38:45.300
That you're going to kill him?

38:47.033 --> 38:48.066
Yes.

38:48.133 --> 38:49.733
I can't let you do that.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.000
And what if you get caught
and you go to prison?

38:52.066 --> 38:54.000
I can't live with the idea
of you behind bars.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.733
There's no other way.

38:57.566 --> 38:58.833
Yes, there is.

39:00.133 --> 39:01.633
I'll do it, I'll kill him.

39:02.933 --> 39:03.966
You will?

39:08.533 --> 39:10.966
- Morning, David.
- Good to see you, doctor.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.966
I understand you've made sort of
a breakthrough with Kim.

39:20.033 --> 39:23.400
Oh, we made considerable
progress in her last session.

39:23.466 --> 39:24.433
Thanks to you.

39:24.500 --> 39:25.833
'Kim said if it wasn't for you'

39:25.900 --> 39:27.433
'she wouldn't have taken
the therapy.'

39:29.466 --> 39:31.700
Uh, would you like
a cup of tea?

39:31.766 --> 39:33.533
Yes, thank you.

39:35.233 --> 39:36.400
You know, doctor,
when all this started

39:36.466 --> 39:37.500
I thought it was a good idea

39:37.566 --> 39:39.566
for her to...see you.

39:39.633 --> 39:41.033
I'm not so sure now.

39:42.100 --> 39:43.766
And why is that?

39:43.833 --> 39:46.766
That's what I wanna talk
to you about.

39:46.833 --> 39:49.033
Well, perhaps we should get
right into the session?

39:50.633 --> 39:52.200
Do-do you like honey?

39:52.900 --> 39:54.333
No, no. Plain.

40:08.766 --> 40:10.366
Oh, you know,
on-on second thought

40:10.433 --> 40:12.433
maybe I will have some honey.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.533
It's, uh,
on that shelf back there.

40:34.066 --> 40:35.200
Say when?

40:37.366 --> 40:39.133
Yeah, that's, that's fine.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.433
Thanks.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.500
Doctor, do you remember..

40:45.566 --> 40:47.333
...when I asked you if Kim

40:47.400 --> 40:50.133
had talked to you
about the novel she was writing?

40:50.200 --> 40:51.633
Yes, I asked her about that.

40:52.433 --> 40:53.900
What'd she say?

40:53.966 --> 40:56.633
Well, let me just say that
from, uh..

40:56.700 --> 40:57.933
...from what I gathered..

40:59.700 --> 41:02.633
...it was...realistic.

41:02.700 --> 41:04.700
It bore a..

41:04.766 --> 41:07.533
...a very strong resemblance
to her real life.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.433
That's all you can tell me?

41:10.500 --> 41:13.600
Well, unless I violate
the confidential relationship

41:13.666 --> 41:15.300
between a doctor and a patient.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.633
'Yes, David, that's all
I can tell you.'

41:23.366 --> 41:26.433
What about the relationshi
between a husband and wife

41:29.266 --> 41:32.633
You don't seem to have a problem
violating that, do you, Ira?

41:32.700 --> 41:34.266
I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:34.333 --> 41:36.300
You see, I know
what's been going on

41:36.366 --> 41:37.666
with you and Kim.

41:37.733 --> 41:38.666
'David--'

41:38.733 --> 41:39.700
And I know that you tried

41:39.766 --> 41:41.500
to poison my tea.

41:41.566 --> 41:45.300
That's why...I switched
cups with you.

41:45.366 --> 41:48.100
D-D-David, what in God's name
are you talking ab..

42:13.800 --> 42:14.933
Hello, David.

42:15.600 --> 42:16.766
You're mad.

42:16.833 --> 42:18.700
Your stark raving mad.
You tried to murder me.

42:18.766 --> 42:20.100
You wanted him to poison me!

42:25.466 --> 42:27.233
I knew you'd read it.

42:27.300 --> 42:29.933
I warned you not to,
but you went against my wishes.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.100
That's why I planted
those buttons under the table.

42:34.166 --> 42:35.766
Unfortunately for you

42:35.833 --> 42:37.200
I rewrote the last chapter

42:38.533 --> 42:41.133
Tania decided not to seduc
her psychiatrist.

42:42.166 --> 42:43.533
You didn't have an affair
with him?

42:44.400 --> 42:45.800
Tania realized she could get rid

42:45.866 --> 42:48.566
of both of her problems
at the same time.

42:48.633 --> 42:51.533
Her nosy shrink
and her contemptible husband.

42:52.733 --> 42:57.033
So she lined...
both cups with poison.

42:57.100 --> 43:00.800
One fast acting, producing a
virtually instantaneous death.

43:00.866 --> 43:04.100
The other one...a bit slower.

43:04.166 --> 43:06.400
So I could have the privilege
of watching you die.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.400
The detective..

43:09.466 --> 43:11.966
...you murdered him too, you..

43:15.233 --> 43:17.466
Oh, I hope you don't mind
if I watch?

43:17.533 --> 43:20.066
Just some research
on this method of poisoning.

43:20.133 --> 43:23.000
See, what's supposed
to happen first is..

43:23.066 --> 43:24.866
...the blood vessels
in your lungs contract

43:24.933 --> 43:26.333
cutting off the oxygen
to your brain

43:26.400 --> 43:28.100
and sending you
into cardiac arrest.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.233
Have you lost control
of your bowels yet?

43:42.766 --> 43:45.100
Gee, I didn't realize
it would last this long.

43:47.300 --> 43:48.500
Good bye, David.

43:49.633 --> 43:50.700
'That sick mind of yours'

43:50.766 --> 43:52.533
'is about to destroy itself.'

44:32.866 --> 44:35.666
Pretty juicy stuff, huh?

44:37.100 --> 44:38.600
I guess this just goes to show

44:38.666 --> 44:41.700
you don't have to be crazy
to be a good writer..

44:42.633 --> 44:44.166
...but it sure helps.
