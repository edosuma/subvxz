01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:20.218
- Roberta?

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:20.218
- What?

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:24.181
Why do you think

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:24.181
we fight all the time?

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.934
Just something to do, I guess.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.772
'Cause, you know,

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.772
I was wondering..

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.941
'Cause I think you're

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.941
a really nice girl.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.444
[chuckles]

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:39.571
I always thought you hated me.

01:01:41.072 --> 01:01:42.533
So did I.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.963
- Roberta?

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:56.963
- What?

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:00.008
Um..

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:03.470
Can I kiss you?

01:02:03.512 --> 01:02:05.597
What are you mumbling?

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.433
Um..

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:12.229
Would it be alright if..

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.567
Can I kiss you?

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.945
- I guess.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:20.945
- Great. You ready?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.408
- Like, you wanna do it now?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.408
- Sure.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.826
I mean, if you want to.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:28.161
Okay.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:38.714
[sighs]

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:38.714
That was great.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.424
It was okay.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.728
- Scott?

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:52.728
- Yeah?

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.607
If you mention this to anyone,

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:56.607
especially your brothers

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.734
I'll beat the shit out of you.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.820
Okay.

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.619
- 'Truth or dare?'

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.619
- 'Truth.'

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.746

'who would you kill for food?'

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:19.713
I dispute the question.

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.923
The odds of that happening

01:03:19.755 --> 01:03:21.923
are slim and nil.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.883
You still have to answer.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:27.596
Then, Chrissy, I guess.

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.139
Why?

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.724
'Cause she'd feed more people.

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:32.850

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.854
Truth or dare?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.022
Truth.

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:42.736
[sighs]

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.448
Do you like your parents?

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:49.867
I don't really know my parents.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.538
But as far as I can tell..

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.457
...they're assholes.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.711
You know, I believe

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.711
what that soldier said

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.963
about your parents

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.963
not always being right.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.507
I mean,

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.507
just 'cause they're adults

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:05.049
doesn't mean they know shit.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.051
Well, I never thought they did.

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:11.598
I did.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.725
[mellow music]

01:04:15.935 --> 01:04:18.522
My dad moved out.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:20.649
They're getting a divorce.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.694
But I thought

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:23.694
your parents got along.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.365
- I lied.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.365
- 'Why?'

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:30.450
I don't know.

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.703
I just wanted to have

01:04:30.492 --> 01:04:32.703
a normal family, you know?

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.412
Like "The Brady Bunch."

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.665
Well, six kids

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.665
sharing one bathroom

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:38.625
does not sound like fun to me.

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:41.961
Besides, Mike and Carol

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:41.961
are widowed.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.172
Well, then,

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:44.172

Buffy and Jody,

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:49.469

- Widower.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.186
- 'Widower.'

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.979
You see, Sam?

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.440
There are no perfect families.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.651
It's normal for things

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:04.651
to be shitty.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:07.696
Yeah.

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:10.657
Well, it might be normal..

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:13.368
...but it still hurts.

But I just figured

that it's normal

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:33.983
Well, maybe you should integrate

color into your wardrobe.

01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:52.252

in how many years

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:55.171
and I've run from every one of

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:55.171
them, which doesn't make it easy

01:33:55.213 --> 01:33:56.714
to get to that next level.

Well, if you don't fall

in love, you can't get hurt.

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:05.098
But it sure is lonely

Mm, God, we loved a mystery,

01:34:13.982 --> 01:34:17.611
didn't we?

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:20.029
Did we have fun

01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:20.029
that summer or what?

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:21.697
Yeah, it was the best.

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:23.283
You know, I used to send

01:34:21.739 --> 01:34:23.283
Crazy Pete

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.828
a Christmas card every year

01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:26.828
with some cash?

01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:28.746
'But it came back last year.'

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:30.290
Yeah, he died.

01:34:31.707 --> 01:34:33.460
Oh.

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:34.752
You know,

01:34:33.502 --> 01:34:34.752
I never told you guys this

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:36.796
but Pete was

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:36.796
Dear Johnny's father.

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:38.214
(Roberta)

01:34:36.838 --> 01:34:38.214
'What?'

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.091
- He was?

01:34:38.256 --> 01:34:40.091
- How did you know that?

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:42.636
Well, do you remember

01:34:40.133 --> 01:34:42.636
our last seance in the cemetery?

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.513
I went back, and Pete was there

01:34:42.676 --> 01:34:44.513
putting flowers

01:34:44.554 --> 01:34:46.264
on Johnny's grave.

01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:50.059
He said something that

01:34:47.807 --> 01:34:50.059
didn't mean as much then

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:52.354
as it does now.

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.148
He told me that

01:34:52.395 --> 01:34:55.148
things happen in life

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:57.066
that you can't stop

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.444
but it wasn't a reason

01:34:57.108 --> 01:34:59.444
to shut out the world.

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.491
[sighs]

01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.491
Wow.

01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:09.120
I realize that

01:35:09.162 --> 01:35:12.457
I've been so afraid

01:35:09.162 --> 01:35:12.457
of the bad things that, um..

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.919
That I've missed out

01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:16.919
on the good.

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.591
You know, I didn't wanna

01:35:19.297 --> 01:35:21.591
come back here.

01:35:24.010 --> 01:35:25.928
But I'm really glad I did.

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:31.351
I'd forgotten how much it helped

01:35:28.056 --> 01:35:31.351
to have you guys as friends.

01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:37.023
We're really lucky

01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:37.023
to have this place..

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.774
...and each other.

01:35:43.655 --> 01:35:45.156
Boy, and there is a part of me

01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.659
that would like to

01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.659
just stay here forever.

01:35:47.701 --> 01:35:49.369
I wouldn't go that far.

01:35:49.411 --> 01:35:51.162
[laughing]

01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:54.499
But it would be nice to

01:35:51.204 --> 01:35:54.499
come back and visit more often.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:57.210
I agree.
