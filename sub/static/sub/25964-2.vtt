If you ever need one of
Your pet projects funded,

00:14.467 --> 00:15.432
You let me know.

00:15.434 --> 00:17.631
You either leave him with me,
Or you stay,

00:17.633 --> 00:20.098
Buy you're not taking my son
Across state lines.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.098
I can't come back On the tour.

00:21.100 --> 00:22.365
Kevin's back,

00:22.367 --> 00:24.798
And he's not letting me
Take nathan with me.

00:24.800 --> 00:25.865
I don't think that
We should be spending.

00:25.867 --> 00:27.932
Personal time together.

00:27.934 --> 00:30.265
I really appreciate you...

00:30.267 --> 00:32.265
- Gigi.
- Hi. I...

00:32.267 --> 00:35.198
Lady mae's ill, I assume.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.465
You know, She's got a cold.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.199
James Lady mae is dealing
With some family matters.

00:38.201 --> 00:41.465
In little rock.
Let us all pray for her.

00:41.467 --> 00:42.865
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:42.867 --> 00:46.065
You're on lock down, Phone too.

00:46.067 --> 00:47.465
It's a letter From the irs.

00:47.467 --> 00:50.498
If we don't pay the irs
$2 million in the next 90 days,

00:50.500 --> 00:51.565
They're gonna come
After us for tax evasion.

00:51.567 --> 00:53.465
Whether we beg clara jackson
On bended knee.

00:53.467 --> 00:55.465
For more of her power
Ball money, I do know.

00:55.467 --> 00:58.432
That it'll all run smoother
If we're a united front.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.732
You can come home, but
Only till we figure out.

01:00.734 --> 01:02.465
This mess with the irs.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.864
And after that, I don't know.

01:40.534 --> 01:41.534
Excuse me?

01:43.334 --> 01:44.932
Where do you think You're going?

01:44.934 --> 01:45.932
To sleep.

01:45.934 --> 01:48.465
That bed In the guest room.

01:48.467 --> 01:50.398
Is like sleeping On coconuts.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.598
My back just couldn't
Take it anymore.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.065
Then sleep on the couch.

01:56.934 --> 01:59.198
Mae, not five hours ago,
We made an agreement.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.932
A united front until we have
The cash to pay the irs.

02:02.934 --> 02:05.465
It is clara jackson that
We're trying to pull one.

02:05.467 --> 02:08.132
Over on, not the children,

02:08.133 --> 02:10.598
And certainly not ourselves.

02:10.600 --> 02:14.265
Go.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.932
Go.

02:25.400 --> 02:27.865
- Hey, daddy.
- Hey.

02:27.867 --> 02:29.265
How's that going?

02:29.267 --> 02:30.932
Well, your mother and
I were just discussing.

02:30.934 --> 02:33.765
The substandard bed
In the guest room.

02:33.767 --> 02:37.265
But don't worry, in a week or
So, we'll be back to normal.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.232
Daddy, even you
Don't believe that.

02:41.833 --> 02:44.565
I'm walking by faith,
Gigi, not by sight.

02:44.567 --> 02:48.232
But right now, I'm going
To bed because I'm tired.

Too early to call?

04:02.601 --> 04:04.799
Hi, grace.
No, it's not too early.

04:04.801 --> 04:07.265
I just got out of yoga.
What's up?

04:07.267 --> 04:09.332
Yoga, I'm impressed.

04:09.334 --> 04:11.432
I got into it after my
First bout with cancer,

04:11.434 --> 04:14.699
And now I'm addicted.
So, how could I help?

04:14.701 --> 04:16.930

Okay, I'll see you then.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.398

Fake, cheerful voice.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.998
That you use with dad?

04:33.000 --> 04:34.665
Mama's trying to
Make a new friend.

04:51.634 --> 04:55.265
Because we're gonna have
People watching us.

On phones, Laptops,

04:58.600 --> 04:59.665
And watches.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.399
Hey.

05:03.401 --> 05:04.965
May I make a phone call?

05:04.967 --> 05:06.832
- To who, isaiah?
- Jacob.

05:06.834 --> 05:09.298
Sophia. I wanted
Her to come over.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.165
I think I owe her an apology.

05:11.167 --> 05:14.265
Well, I think
That should be okay.

05:17.134 --> 05:20.065
Alright, here you go.

Use my phone.

Phone call right there.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.100
It's okay.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.398
It's only been a few days
Since that little girl.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.198
Ran away. We said no phone.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.798
Let her have the phone.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.598
We're going to know
Who she calls anyway.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.798
I know, but she's got to know
We're serious about this.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.965
Believe me, She knows.

05:58.534 --> 05:59.998

Section this semester.

06:03.667 --> 06:07.198

06:21.934 --> 06:23.865
You guys are doing it?
That's great.

06:23.867 --> 06:26.165
Yeah, well, we couldn't
Give their money back.

That you all still have.

06:38.134 --> 06:39.665
Good news to share
About marriage.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.198
You know, interestingly,
There were arguments.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.798
In the early church about
The efficacy of baptisms.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.998
Performed By sinful priests.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.732
Folk decided it didn't
Matter if the priest.

06:50.734 --> 06:53.632
Was a sinner,
The sacrament worked.

06:53.634 --> 06:55.198
You see what you started?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.798
Grace, why can't you just
Pay more attention.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.332
To your own inconsistencies.

06:59.334 --> 07:02.065
And leave it to your father
And me to fix his?

07:02.067 --> 07:04.332
- Excuse me?
- What inconsistencies, mama?

07:04.334 --> 07:06.432
You sexual commerce With darius.

07:07.734 --> 07:10.731
The way you scamper back
And forth across memphis.

07:10.733 --> 07:13.265
Like a rabbit at all hours
Of the night,

07:13.267 --> 07:14.631
Tiptoeing in here when...

07:14.633 --> 07:15.699
When good people.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.365
Are screaming
And slamming doors?

07:17.367 --> 07:20.532
But is it behavior
Befitting a church leader.

07:20.534 --> 07:22.898
Is all I meant.
Have a great day, mama.

07:22.900 --> 07:26.332
Of all the nerve of
This girl, her audacity.

07:26.334 --> 07:28.465
She just puts her
Nose in everything.

07:28.467 --> 07:31.332
I can't imagine where
She got that. Showtime.

And I got Different reports.

07:49.734 --> 07:52.732

Thank you, bishop.

08:47.534 --> 08:48.832
What do you think?

08:48.834 --> 08:51.032
I love the idea of a legal
Defense fund.

08:51.034 --> 08:52.999
For the victims
Of domestic abuse.

08:53.001 --> 08:56.265
It's sad we have to have
It, but it's wonderful.

08:56.267 --> 08:58.398
We have a warrior
Goddess like you.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.732
To fight the good fight.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.998
Well, you
Know, after what happened.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.565
With my uncle,
I'm sure you heard.

09:02.567 --> 09:05.299
I did, And I'm glad he's dead.

09:05.301 --> 09:07.032
I had my own
Struggles with that.

09:07.034 --> 09:09.998
With what?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.265
You know, It was everywhere.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.732
Well, you know, if the
D.A. Had pressed charges,

09:15.734 --> 09:17.332
I would have been able to
Afford the best lawyer.

09:17.334 --> 09:19.065
I just feel like
Every woman out there.

09:19.067 --> 09:20.732
Should be able to have
The same advantage.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.665
Well, Let's give it to 'em.

09:22.667 --> 09:23.999
You think We can raise $25,000?

09:24.001 --> 09:25.565
I say we go For $50,000.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.498
That would be amazing.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.098
Well, my middle name Is amazing.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.598
You know, actually, I
Have a lot of clients.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.398
That I think would
Love to help with this.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.398
Some out of sympathy,
Some out of guilt,

09:37.400 --> 09:39.398
And others
Just need a write-off.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.598
Well, ms. Cross,
I am so glad I called.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.465
Well, me too. You just
Got to call me rochelle.

09:45.467 --> 09:46.798
Alright, rochelle.

09:46.800 --> 09:48.265
You know, I love working
With other women.

09:48.267 --> 09:50.398
It doesn't happen as
Frequent as I like, but...

09:50.400 --> 09:51.532
Why do you think That is?

09:51.534 --> 09:54.065
Some view other
Women as a threat.

09:54.067 --> 09:57.265
But you and me, pastor,
Let's be the exception.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.598
You're gonna have to start
Calling me grace?

09:58.600 --> 09:59.998
Well, I'll do that.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.998
Okay, you Have a good afternoon.

You too.

10:08.934 --> 10:11.398
Good to see you this morning.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.865
Hi, stranger.

10:14.867 --> 10:15.932
- How are you?
- I'm good.

10:15.934 --> 10:17.998
I know I'm supposed to
Be keeping my distance,

10:18.000 --> 10:19.932
But I was already in
The building,

10:19.934 --> 10:21.398
And I felt Blue passing.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.265
Without at least A brief hello.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.332
Well, what brings you
Here this morning?

10:25.334 --> 10:27.332
Well, I just came out
Of a meeting with grace.

10:27.334 --> 10:29.665
We're working together on a
Legal fund she just started.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.332
That's marvelous.

10:32.334 --> 10:33.598
My pleasure.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.065
So how are you?

10:35.067 --> 10:38.598
I'm... I'm getting by.

10:38.600 --> 10:41.265
Well, I was thinking maybe
You should look into renting.

10:41.267 --> 10:43.332
A long-term suite, I mean,
Those nightly rates.

10:43.334 --> 10:45.532
At the biltmore
Will sneak up on you.

10:45.534 --> 10:49.265
Yeah, actually,

10:49.267 --> 10:51.265
I'm... I'm back at home.

10:51.267 --> 10:52.365
You are?

10:53.501 --> 10:55.365
Congratulations.

10:55.367 --> 10:58.799
It's... it's good To hear that.

10:58.801 --> 11:01.998
Well, you keep up
The good work here.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.399
Rochelle Lady mae.

11:21.134 --> 11:23.265
Ms. Cross, What a surprise.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.565
How's our zora doing?

11:26.567 --> 11:27.599
In what sense?

11:28.867 --> 11:30.465
Maybe I said too much.

11:30.467 --> 11:32.132
You haven't Said quite enough.

11:32.134 --> 11:35.832
I just...
Well, now I feel silly.

11:35.834 --> 11:40.065
I was wondering if she's
At peace with being home?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.999
Running away so often
Can feel like a solution,

11:42.001 --> 11:44.399
But it rarely ever is,
Don't you think?

11:45.733 --> 11:47.265
Well, I haven't tried It myself,

11:47.267 --> 11:49.865
So I can't really
Speak to the subject.

11:49.867 --> 11:51.432
I always stand and fight.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.198
Well, there you go.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.632
Look at me working my way
Up to feeling important.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.865
And god gives me A lesson.

11:59.867 --> 12:00.865
Watch out, rochelle.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.998
You don't know
Who you're dealing with.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.665
I have a feeling None of us do.

12:08.734 --> 12:10.332
Please tell zora
I'm lifting her up.

12:10.334 --> 12:14.998
All you greenleafs,
You're all on my list.

12:22.267 --> 12:26.065
I know I'm irreplaceable,
But I hope you were able.

12:26.067 --> 12:27.865
To find someone to cover
For me tonight.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.531
Yeah, the venue set me
Up with someone local.

12:29.533 --> 12:30.665
She just Finished rehearsal.

12:30.667 --> 12:34.565
Well, how was she?
Not too good, I hope?

12:34.567 --> 12:35.965
She'll do for the night,

12:35.967 --> 12:38.098
But she's No charity greenleaf.

12:38.100 --> 12:40.265
Listen, I need you
Here wednesday.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.465
I'm serious, charity.

12:41.467 --> 12:42.998
You will see me
Wednesday morning.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.998
Music to my ears.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.532
Alright, Talk to you later.

12:46.534 --> 12:49.065
Bye.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.598
Pastor greenleaf,
You got a minute?

12:51.600 --> 12:54.732
Hey, tasha, come on in,
What's the word?

12:54.734 --> 12:56.532
Well, I was going through.

12:56.534 --> 12:58.865
The new members
Information cards.

12:58.867 --> 13:01.665
And some of these names.

13:01.667 --> 13:03.432
I had to call this one up.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.831
I spelled it out Phonetically.

13:07.367 --> 13:13.931
Okay, Cibongelay idayola jones.

13:13.933 --> 13:15.398
Exactly, that's it.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.865
And then there's this
One, candy mosely.

13:18.867 --> 13:20.865
Well, that one's Not that hard.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.465
Until you see she
Spells it with a "Q."

13:23.467 --> 13:26.832
Yeah, thanks For the heads up.

13:28.234 --> 13:29.898
Kerissa's gonna get a kick
Out of this one.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.731
Hopefully she can
Find someone to teach.

13:31.733 --> 13:33.665
Home girl how to spell.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.398
Well, you know what?

13:37.400 --> 13:40.732
I don't think we can blame
Quandy for this.

13:41.934 --> 13:43.265
That's on her mama.

13:43.267 --> 13:44.999
You're right about That one.

13:50.967 --> 13:52.299
Man Thank you For fitting us in.

13:52.301 --> 13:54.765
Yeah, Sorry it took so long.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.765
My schedule has been
Absolutely packed.

13:56.767 --> 13:59.931
With being first lady
Or doing your job?

13:59.933 --> 14:02.465
We know You're busy with both.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.198
Well, let's talk
About jeremy's essay.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.798
A b is a very good grade.

14:07.800 --> 14:09.865
Maybe For community college.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.498
Jeremy's applying To yale.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.998
So what are we gonna
Do to fix this?

14:14.000 --> 14:15.765
Well, I can refer him A tutor.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.031
Maybe I need to be Clearer.

14:17.033 --> 14:20.032
What are you gonna
Do to fix this?

14:20.034 --> 14:22.065
I just told you.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.332
Jeremy isn't some
Scholarship kid.

14:24.334 --> 14:26.598
Yeah, and we have
Been very generous.

14:27.801 --> 14:31.198
On behalf of all of
Those scholarship kids,

14:31.200 --> 14:35.998
We are so very appreciative
Of that heartfelt generosity,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.731
But I have to trust
Jeremy's teacher on this.

14:38.733 --> 14:40.765
See, she hasn't Even read it.

14:44.267 --> 14:47.065
You read this and tell me
It's not an a.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.132
So, welcome, everyone,

15:39.434 --> 15:42.398
No, I'm the first lady.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.198
I thought you
Were the first lady.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.865
Well, no, first lady,
This is miss ethel gibson.

15:49.867 --> 15:51.465
She lives on the west side
Of memphis,

15:51.467 --> 15:53.198
And she heard about the
Preachers preaching,

15:53.200 --> 15:54.198
And she wanted To come down here.

15:54.200 --> 15:55.198
And check it out.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.465
Aw, well, Welcome to triumph.

To getting to know you two.

16:00.367 --> 16:01.367
Alright.

16:09.233 --> 16:10.765
Well, that was awkward.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.898
Baby, it's just an old lady
Making an honest mistake.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.432
Yeah, she thought tasha was
The first lady.

16:17.634 --> 16:19.332
Look, you think you
Have time later.

16:19.334 --> 16:21.732
To look at a budget for
The streaming setup?

16:21.734 --> 16:23.998
I don't, I have to pick
Zora up from counseling.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.132
Maybe tonight We can look at it.

16:26.134 --> 16:28.699
- Alright, I'll print 'em out.
- Okay.

16:28.701 --> 16:30.165
- You do your thing.
- Okay.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.598
I have made sacrifices, Kevin,

16:36.600 --> 16:39.398
Both during our relationship
And after.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.465
Is that a lie?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.398
No, it's not a lie, Charity.

16:42.400 --> 16:45.398
Doing this tour
Is a dream for me.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.898
I'm going back
Wednesday morning.

16:46.900 --> 16:48.532
Okay, And I want you to go,

16:48.534 --> 16:50.565
But you're gonna leave
Nathan with me.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.298
Why are you doing This to me?

16:52.300 --> 16:53.598
Charity, it's not About you.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.132
Between rehearsals
And performances.

16:55.134 --> 16:56.798
And whatever else you and jabari
Are getting busy with.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.398
In between time,

16:58.400 --> 17:00.932
Nathan's gonna be left with
Complete strangers, isn't he?

17:00.934 --> 17:02.665
Kevin, you have a job, Too.

17:02.667 --> 17:05.265
It's not like childcare
Is a bad thing.

17:05.267 --> 17:06.732
It's a part of life.

17:06.733 --> 17:10.598
Look, all I'm saying is, it
Is difficult for an adult.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.998
On the road let
Alone a small child.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.132
Why drag him Around like that?

17:16.134 --> 17:19.931
Does that sound like
Good parenting to you?

17:19.933 --> 17:22.731
Charity, I'm his father.

17:22.733 --> 17:26.131
Leave him with me.

17:26.133 --> 17:27.464
He'll be okay.

17:30.334 --> 17:33.665
Pastor, here is
The payroll report.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.632
Thank you.

17:38.467 --> 17:41.132
Wow, tasha, I don't know
What we'd do without you.

17:41.134 --> 17:42.598
- Stop it.
- Seriously.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.065
No, do you know how many
Pastors in your position...

17:45.067 --> 17:47.532
Hey, forget pastors, first
Lady's would've kicked me.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.065
To the curb When they took over?

17:53.933 --> 17:56.398
Are you contemplating
A life change?

17:56.400 --> 17:59.431
No, just shopping For kerissa.

17:59.433 --> 18:00.765
Yeah, she's been so busy Lately,

18:00.767 --> 18:02.365
I just wanted to do
Something nice for her.

18:02.367 --> 18:06.065
Aw, sweet, well, what
About some jewelry.

18:06.067 --> 18:07.998
Because you know,
Clothes, we always end up.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.798
Taking that stuff Back anyway.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.665
Can you find good
Jewelry online?

18:12.667 --> 18:15.331
On... lord have mercy,
You cannot find jewelry.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.465
On the internet.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.732
You need to look at it,
Lay it out,

18:18.734 --> 18:21.698
Touch all the surfaces
Of the stones.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.698
I can take you To my shop.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.065
Really? It's kind of late.

18:25.067 --> 18:27.365
You sure you have time?
Time to look at jewelry?

18:27.367 --> 18:29.432
Do you know who you're
Talking to right now?

18:31.067 --> 18:32.865
Plus, I could really go
For a glass of champagne.

18:32.867 --> 18:34.198
Champagne?

18:34.200 --> 18:38.732
Yeah, that's how
My jeweler gets down, okay?

18:38.734 --> 18:41.499
Okay. I got to see this place.

18:42.867 --> 18:44.332
Mae Clara,
Is everything alright?

18:44.334 --> 18:46.665
The food is lovely.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.998
If cornbread could sing,
You would have heard.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.998
The hallelujah chorus
Coming out in the oven.

18:52.867 --> 18:54.699
Thank you.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.365
But the minute
I walked into this house,

18:57.367 --> 18:59.598
It didn't feel right.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.565
Something seemed off kilter.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.032
Well, I don't know
How that could be.

19:06.034 --> 19:07.798
Anything ever gets
Off kilter around here,

19:07.800 --> 19:10.999
My beautiful wife is quick
To put in its place.

19:11.001 --> 19:12.599
She's ruthless that way.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.299
I figured it out.

19:17.301 --> 19:19.232
It's the paintings.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.831
You've changed The paintings.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.765
Lord.

19:22.767 --> 19:25.665
The mclean castillos.

19:25.667 --> 19:26.665
Yes.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.998
Yes, yes, yes.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.431
Just felt like it
Was time to move on.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.231
Horace would get so upset
With me.

19:35.233 --> 19:37.098
When I moved things around.

19:37.100 --> 19:38.932
He would just fuss and fuss.

19:41.534 --> 19:43.132
You know, he does, too.

19:43.134 --> 19:45.598
Been missing him hard Lately.

19:45.600 --> 19:49.065
Well, we miss the two
Of you together, too.

19:49.067 --> 19:51.232
- Yes.
- Still so much in love.

19:51.234 --> 19:54.765
Just like me and mae,
After all those years.

19:54.767 --> 19:56.565
How long has it
Been for you two?

19:56.567 --> 20:00.031
- 44 years.
- Soon to be 45.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.099
45.

20:02.567 --> 20:03.665
Y'all going on a trip?

20:06.267 --> 20:08.932
I hope I didn't Ruin a surprise.

20:08.934 --> 20:11.265
No, no, no.

20:13.067 --> 20:15.165
You haven't Ruined anything.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.565
Clara, are you alright?

20:20.901 --> 20:23.399
Just thinking Of horace.

20:26.567 --> 20:29.865
You two are so blessed.

20:29.867 --> 20:33.465
And we never forget it,
Do we, dear?

20:33.467 --> 20:34.467
Never.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.932
They're all really nice.

20:37.934 --> 20:39.732
What about this one?

20:43.400 --> 20:45.565
What's gonna get?

20:45.567 --> 20:47.765
You don't like it?

20:47.767 --> 20:50.498
It's nice, but that
Necklace is more like,

20:50.500 --> 20:55.132
"I like you a lot,"
Whereas this one...

20:55.134 --> 20:58.265
Now, this says,
"You are my world."

20:58.267 --> 21:02.465
This is from
A new young designer.

21:02.467 --> 21:05.332
Come on now.

21:05.334 --> 21:06.798
This is beautiful.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.299
It would look even more
Beautiful against your skin.

21:09.301 --> 21:10.399
- May I?
- May you?

21:10.401 --> 21:14.398
If you... hurry up and
Get that on me.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.065
My goodness.

21:22.867 --> 21:23.998
Well?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.798
When you're right, You're right.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.632
I got to look at this.

21:31.267 --> 21:33.965
My god.

21:33.967 --> 21:37.632
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

21:37.634 --> 21:39.698
It's so gorgeous, I can't
Even breathe right now.

21:39.700 --> 21:40.765
Wow.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.998
I'm sure basie
Bought you nice things.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.998
I mean, sure, he got me
Things, but then it would.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.998
Be, like, a day or two later
And he'd say, "Baby, honey",

21:48.000 --> 21:52.132
"I got into this gambling
Situation" and, you know.

21:52.134 --> 21:54.332
I'm sorry you
Had to deal with that.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.565
Well, you'd never
Do that to kerissa.

21:58.767 --> 21:59.767
Wow.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.365
Um...

22:05.367 --> 22:08.198
I'll take it.

22:08.200 --> 22:09.931
Great.

22:09.933 --> 22:12.898
Well, just hold On a hot minute.

22:12.900 --> 22:15.532
I need to lock this
In my memory bank now.

22:17.100 --> 22:19.865
I'll ring it up.

22:19.867 --> 22:21.665
Charity And you'll love this.

22:21.667 --> 22:25.332
He's an expert In parenting now.

22:25.334 --> 22:26.565
Telling me that

22:26.567 --> 22:29.831
I shouldn't take nathan
On the road with me.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.098
Well, it is Just six weeks.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.231
Exactly, I wouldn't be
Taking him if it was.

22:34.233 --> 22:37.498
For six months, Would I?

22:37.500 --> 22:41.099
No, so go ahead, kevin,
Take me to court.

22:41.101 --> 22:43.132
Well, he just might.

22:43.134 --> 22:44.532
I don't care.

22:45.867 --> 22:48.398
It's like I'd be rewarding
Him for being a jerk.

22:48.400 --> 22:51.265

Out of spite.

I was, but I'm over it.

23:52.134 --> 23:54.332
Good.

23:54.334 --> 23:56.532
Can you do me A favor, though?

23:56.534 --> 23:57.599
Sure, what do you need?

23:58.801 --> 24:00.798
Like, one of those
Pre-paid phones.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.199
From wal-mart Or something.

24:03.867 --> 24:05.798
Are you sure That's a good idea?

24:05.800 --> 24:09.132
Sophia, I'm going
Crazy in this room.

24:09.134 --> 24:10.598
I can't use my phone,

24:10.600 --> 24:12.798
I can't watch tv,
Use the internet.

24:12.800 --> 24:16.565
I had to use the warden's
Phone just to call you.

24:17.867 --> 24:20.598
Please, if I cannot communicate
With the outside world,

24:20.600 --> 24:25.332
I'm going to lose my
Entire mind, please?

24:25.334 --> 24:27.799
You gonna call isaiah?

24:27.801 --> 24:30.132
- Sophia, come on.
- So you are.

24:30.134 --> 24:33.598
Then I can't do it.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.865
Can't or won't?

24:35.867 --> 24:38.398
He hits you, zora.

24:38.400 --> 24:42.132
He hits you and he
Treats you like crap.

24:42.134 --> 24:46.065
I won't. I'm sorry.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.031
Clara Look at the time.

24:58.033 --> 25:00.898
No, no, no, I've got
To get this old body home.

25:00.900 --> 25:06.265
Clara, there is a piece
Of business.

25:06.267 --> 25:08.865
That we wanted
To put on your heart.

25:08.867 --> 25:10.932
Church business?

25:10.934 --> 25:13.532
You know, Satan's always busy.

25:13.534 --> 25:14.998
That old devil
Sent us a tax bill,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.598
Saying we owe $2 million.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.732
- Another tax problem?
- The same one.

25:21.734 --> 25:25.198
Max said he would
Handle it, but he didn't.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.798
Well, you can't cuss him out,
Can you? He's dead now.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.332
They're saying we have
To pay what we owe.

25:29.334 --> 25:32.232
Plus interest And penalties.

25:32.234 --> 25:34.298
And james and I were
Hoping that you'd be able.

25:34.300 --> 25:37.165
To help us out here.

25:37.167 --> 25:38.965
Is that why you asked me here?

25:38.967 --> 25:40.065
It's part of it, yes.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.732
Well, $2 million's a lot,

25:44.734 --> 25:46.965
Even for someone
With all my money.

25:46.967 --> 25:50.465
And we would never ask you
If it didn't mean everything.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.465
Please know that.

25:52.467 --> 25:53.998
You two don't have it?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.065
The past few years have
Been hard.

25:56.067 --> 25:57.765
For a variety Of reasons,

25:57.767 --> 25:59.365
We're not liquid right now.

25:59.367 --> 26:02.032
I... We could probably
Pay, I don't know,

26:02.034 --> 26:04.865
A couple of hundred
Thousand, but that's it.

26:04.867 --> 26:09.532
Look, if the answer Is no,

26:09.534 --> 26:12.998
Please know that
Our feelings for you.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.065
Won't change one bit.

26:14.067 --> 26:17.431
- No.
- But we need your help.

26:17.433 --> 26:18.865
The church Needs your help.

26:29.933 --> 26:33.398
You know, I'm gonna
Call rochelle later.

26:33.400 --> 26:34.798
You sure That's a good idea?

26:34.800 --> 26:36.665
To have her so involved
In the church?

26:36.667 --> 26:38.532
She's already involved.
Could you?

26:38.534 --> 26:39.798
Yeah.

26:39.800 --> 26:41.198
Not a day goes by
That she's not at the church.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.265
At least this way, I
Keep her in my sights.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.665
And out Of my father's office.

26:44.667 --> 26:47.198
Well, he's moved
Back in the house.

26:47.200 --> 26:50.132
Yeah, I don't know
What that's about.

26:50.134 --> 26:52.932
She's got him In the guest room.

26:52.934 --> 26:54.465
You can cut the tension
With a knife.

26:54.467 --> 26:57.965
I swear this is
So far from over.

26:57.967 --> 26:58.965
Does it ever occur To you.

26:58.967 --> 27:00.332
That maybe
Your father's the one?

27:00.334 --> 27:01.932
The one what?

27:01.934 --> 27:04.332
The one that's leading
This woman on?

27:04.334 --> 27:05.865
No, he wouldn't do that.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.999
Okay, it's just a thought,
Just a thought.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.065
Where are you going?

27:17.067 --> 27:18.998
I'm gonna go home.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.065
- Home?
- Yeah.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.931
My mother gave me An earful.

27:23.933 --> 27:26.265
About my sexual commerce
This morning.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.665
So going home Will prove what?

27:28.667 --> 27:30.732
Well, it'll get her
Off my back, for one.

27:30.734 --> 27:33.398
So you want her to think
We're not having sex?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.398
'Cause we just had sex.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.299
- I know.
- So stay.

27:40.734 --> 27:43.231
Don't be a hypocrite.

27:43.233 --> 27:46.632
Don't be just like her,
Don't be like all of them.

27:46.634 --> 27:48.065
Why do that?

27:53.034 --> 27:55.198
Thank you.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.532
For what?

28:01.967 --> 28:04.499
For making leaving Easier.

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
What's going on?

28:20.067 --> 28:22.965
Sophia convinced us to
Let you have this back.

28:24.134 --> 28:26.399
She said We could trust you.

28:26.401 --> 28:29.399
She's a woman Of great insight.

28:31.267 --> 28:33.065
You're welcome.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.465
Thank you.

28:54.334 --> 28:57.199
We got it.

28:57.201 --> 28:58.665
She's gonna talk to
Her money manager.

28:58.667 --> 29:01.865
Nice work, first lady.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.165
What are we gonna
Do for our 45th?

29:04.167 --> 29:06.432
You know, A trip would be nice.

29:06.434 --> 29:09.632
It's got to be Something modest,

29:09.634 --> 29:11.265
But I guess togetherness
Is the point?

29:12.967 --> 29:15.965
What... What is it?

29:15.967 --> 29:17.832
What did you tell her?

29:17.834 --> 29:18.998
You heard every word.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.198
Not clara, rochelle.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.632
What do you mean telling her
About our family business?

29:23.634 --> 29:24.665
What did I tell rochelle?

29:24.667 --> 29:27.398
How does she know About zora?

29:29.467 --> 29:31.065
I...

29:31.067 --> 29:33.198
I guess I must have
Said something.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.200
When?

29:38.333 --> 29:40.065
Well, let me answer that.

29:40.067 --> 29:41.799
When the two of you
Were together at.

29:41.801 --> 29:43.932
The biltmore hotel.

29:43.934 --> 29:45.932
Is that who you were
With when you left?

29:45.934 --> 29:49.132
You went with her?
To go crying to her?!

29:50.701 --> 29:52.631
Do you not see that
You are willing this.

29:52.633 --> 29:54.565
Non-existent affair Into being?

29:54.567 --> 29:56.965
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

29:56.967 --> 29:58.298
I mean, You're creating it.

29:58.300 --> 30:00.132
Only god creates From nothing.

30:00.134 --> 30:02.432
I'm just trying
To clean up your mess.

30:02.434 --> 30:05.165
Really?

30:05.167 --> 30:07.598
Well, What about your mess?

30:07.600 --> 30:10.765
You make such a show
Of all your strength, mae.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.932
But I swear, I've never
Seen a woman so fragile.

30:12.934 --> 30:17.032
That she cannot even
Consider her own sinfulness.

30:34.134 --> 30:36.798
Are you going to tell me?

30:36.800 --> 30:39.198
- Tell you what?
- Where you were.

30:39.200 --> 30:42.865
There you go With the questions.

30:42.867 --> 30:44.665
I was worried.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.798
Were you?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.665
Alright.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.198
I'm sorry.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.798
But look.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.998
I know how hard you work.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.798
For our family, for your
Students, for our church.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.132
No one works harder Than you.

31:03.067 --> 31:06.198
So I just wanted To say that.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.732
You are the first lady...

31:10.400 --> 31:13.998
And you're my first
Lady in every way.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.332
Is this where you were?

31:15.334 --> 31:16.532
Yes, it is.

31:17.734 --> 31:19.332
And it has champagne.

31:23.167 --> 31:25.432

31:50.667 --> 31:52.698
Beauty on beauty.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.131
Thank you.

31:54.133 --> 31:57.332
You're welcome. Thank you.

32:05.067 --> 32:08.132
Meet me in the bedroom.

32:08.134 --> 32:09.532
Okay.

32:34.201 --> 32:35.465
Can I get you Anything, daddy?

32:35.467 --> 32:36.798
A refill? Something?

32:36.800 --> 32:39.265
No, no. I've had
Too much already.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.198
Mom was pretty upset.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.465
Don't you come After me.

32:52.467 --> 32:54.065
Not tonight,
Not you, not about this.

32:54.067 --> 32:55.932
She's up there Crying, daddy.

32:55.934 --> 32:58.731
Gigi, it's none
Of your business.

32:58.733 --> 33:00.398
It's my business when
I see rochelle cross.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.865
Parading in and out
Of your office.

33:01.867 --> 33:03.532
Like she owns The church.

33:03.534 --> 33:05.465
Mama is not wrong For wondering.

33:05.467 --> 33:08.398
There's nothing between
Me and ms. Cross!

33:08.400 --> 33:09.932
Then let her go.

33:11.667 --> 33:13.065
You see?

33:13.067 --> 33:14.732
You won't do it.

33:14.734 --> 33:17.698
You are intent on
Flaunting this friendship.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.732
Just rubbing it
In her face. Why?

33:19.734 --> 33:22.798
If this woman's presence
Is so troubling,

33:22.800 --> 33:25.065
Why are you Working with her.

33:25.067 --> 33:26.532
In whatever it is You're doing?

33:26.534 --> 33:28.265
'Cause if she's gonna be up
In this church like this,

33:28.267 --> 33:32.198
We might as well get
Something useful out of her.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.398
And after what you did
With aunt mavis.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.232
Gigi!

33:34.234 --> 33:36.098
Mama deserves A respect from you.

33:36.100 --> 33:39.832
Above and beyond what
You think is called for.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.532
Saint mae.

33:48.934 --> 33:52.165
Your mama had
An affair with lionel.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.065
Excuse me.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.732
Yes, sir.

34:38.800 --> 34:39.864
What, grace?

34:41.100 --> 34:44.399
Did you have an affair
With lionel?

34:44.400 --> 34:46.699
I don't believe That man.

34:49.667 --> 34:50.899
Is that true?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.765
I'm gonna assume it is.

34:57.767 --> 35:00.732
You don't have a right
To ask me questions.

35:00.734 --> 35:03.565
You have no right to
Say a word about me.

35:03.567 --> 35:05.632
Or my life.

35:05.634 --> 35:07.532
Everything you let
Happen under this roof,

35:07.534 --> 35:09.132
In this church.

35:09.134 --> 35:11.998
Stop blaming everyone
Else, especially me.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.999
- Get out.
- I am done feeling bad.

35:14.001 --> 35:15.865
- Get out.
- I'm done feeling wrong.

35:15.867 --> 35:17.399
- Get out!
- I'm done feeling dirty!

35:17.401 --> 35:21.032
- Get out!
- I am done! Done!

35:29.767 --> 35:33.099
So I'm glad You like the crib.

Yeah. Yeah.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.665
But I have to stay
Off the internet.

35:45.667 --> 35:48.265

With a bluetooth.

35:49.800 --> 35:53.065
And make sure to send
Me that playlist.

35:54.267 --> 35:57.065

For a few days.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.398
I am so, so sorry.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.265
What do you mean

Can't leave nathan.

36:39.867 --> 36:41.665

36:41.667 --> 36:45.132
Look, it's just a job.

We still have us.

36:49.234 --> 36:50.999

36:56.134 --> 36:57.599

People are willing.

36:57.601 --> 36:59.265
To sit down with me
About the fund?

36:59.267 --> 37:01.132
I could have Gotten more,

37:01.134 --> 37:03.198

37:08.667 --> 37:09.998
I can do for you.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.398
Well, ms. Cross.

37:11.400 --> 37:13.265
I told you To call me rochelle.

37:13.267 --> 37:14.898

37:14.900 --> 37:16.765
Just one question, Rochelle.

37:16.767 --> 37:18.131
Fire away.

37:18.133 --> 37:22.065
Is there anything... I...

37:25.734 --> 37:29.531
Is something going on
Between you and my father?

37:29.533 --> 37:30.865
Bishop?

37:30.867 --> 37:33.565
You're in his
Office quite often.

37:33.567 --> 37:36.465
After what we talked
About just yesterday,

37:36.467 --> 37:38.532
Women seeing other
Women as a threat.

37:38.534 --> 37:39.998
And you ask me that?

37:40.000 --> 37:42.665
I went out on a limb
For you and asked.

37:42.667 --> 37:45.599
Half my client list to help you
Get what you need.

37:47.167 --> 37:48.365
Grace, I can't believe you.

37:48.367 --> 37:49.632
Listen, I'm sorry.

37:49.634 --> 37:52.499
Don't be. It's par
For the course.

37:55.734 --> 37:59.132
It's my fault for
Thinking a woman like you,

37:59.134 --> 38:06.132
A woman from my generation,
Could think different.

38:06.134 --> 38:07.232
My bad.

38:33.333 --> 38:35.331
Woman, we can't let
Anything stop us.

38:35.333 --> 38:38.932
From reaching our goal.
We got work to do.

38:38.934 --> 38:41.598
This is the work Of the lord.

38:41.600 --> 38:42.899
Yes. Yes, it is.

38:48.334 --> 38:50.465
You're stuck With me now.

38:52.867 --> 38:54.098

The second tuesday.

38:56.767 --> 38:58.631

38:58.633 --> 39:00.598
Get off the phone...

39:00.600 --> 39:01.600

39:03.167 --> 39:05.699
Can you hold on for a moment?

39:08.800 --> 39:10.632
- What is it?
- What is it?

39:10.634 --> 39:12.265
Yes. What is it? I'm busy.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.665
You had an affair
With my sister.

39:14.667 --> 39:17.265
And even you don't
Deny that it happened.

39:17.267 --> 39:21.198
At least once after
We were married, james.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.732
And I have a feeling
That it happened.

39:22.734 --> 39:25.532
Far more often than that.

39:25.534 --> 39:27.731
You have given me no
Real clarity about.

39:27.733 --> 39:31.398
This relationship
With this ms. Cross.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.732
And I have every reason
To believe that you were.

39:33.734 --> 39:35.198
At the biltmore hotel.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.065
When your granddaughter was
Lost to the world.

39:38.067 --> 39:40.732
And now...

39:40.734 --> 39:44.798
You've shared the only
Secret that I have.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.932
A sin I committed
Only because you had.

39:47.934 --> 39:51.665
Broken my heart So completely.

39:51.667 --> 39:54.065
So what kind of fool
Would I be to stay.

39:54.067 --> 39:57.198
Married to you now?

39:57.200 --> 40:01.132
The minute we get
This check from clara,

40:01.134 --> 40:05.932
And this irs thing
Is all cleared up,

40:05.934 --> 40:10.732
I am divorcing Your black ass.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.798
And, james...

40:24.800 --> 40:27.532
Don't keep your caller
On hold. It's rude.
