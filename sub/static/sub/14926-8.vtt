WEBVTT

00:04.605 --> 00:05.373
COME ON, MAN.
IT'S EDDIE.

00:05.406 --> 00:06.274
YOUR LITTLE EDWIN.

00:06.307 --> 00:07.775
YOU OWE ME ONE.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.610
WELL, THAT'S
NOT MY FAULT.

00:09.643 --> 00:10.644
OK. I CAN HANG ON.

00:10.678 --> 00:12.813
HEY, EDDIE, DON'T YOU
HAVE A PHONE AT YOUR HOUSE?

00:12.846 --> 00:16.650
THERE ARE CERTAIN CALLS
I'D PREFER NOT TO
ORIGINATE AT MY HOUSE.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.585
OH, GREAT. OK.

00:17.618 --> 00:18.619
FEED MY KIDS WHEN
I'M IN PRISON, ALL RIGHT?

00:18.652 --> 00:21.689
I'M MAKING THIS CALL FOR
YOUR DAUGHTER, BUBBA JAY.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.225
DON'T CALL ME BUBBA JAY.

00:24.492 --> 00:28.062
YEAH. YOU GOT 'EM?
YOU GOT THE TICKETS?

00:28.096 --> 00:31.099
GOOD. GOOD. ROCK ON.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.067
I GOT 'EM.

00:33.101 --> 00:33.734
NO.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.370
YEAH.
THE NO DOUBT TICKETS?

00:36.404 --> 00:37.838
YEAH.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.806
NO.

00:38.839 --> 00:39.907
I'M TELLIN' YOU, YEAH.

00:39.940 --> 00:42.676
AAH! OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

00:42.710 --> 00:45.213
YOU ARE THE BEST UNCLE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.114
OK. GET OFF ME.

00:47.081 --> 00:49.450
I BROUGHT THE SNAKE.
WHICH DRAIN IS CLOGGED?

00:49.483 --> 00:51.119
GREAT, DAD.
GIVE IT HERE.
Walt: NO, NO.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.487
THIS IS A FINELY-TUNED
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

00:53.521 --> 00:54.622
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE IT.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.523
DAD, I'M AN ELECTRICIAN.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.225
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO USE A DRILL?

00:57.258 --> 00:59.127
WHEN YOU HOOK
A DRILL UP TO A SNAKE,

00:59.160 --> 01:01.662
IT'S A WHOLE
DIFFERENT ANIMAL.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.432
NOW, WHAT DID YOU CLOG
THE SINK WITH, ANYWAY?

01:04.465 --> 01:06.167
NOTHING.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.104
HENRY, DON'T WEAR
A HAT IN THE HOUSE.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.805
OK.

01:15.909 --> 01:19.647
OH, DEAR LORD.
PUT IT BACK ON.
PUT IT BACK ON.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.116
DAD, WAIT. HE GOT A
NOT-SO-GREAT HAIRCUT.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.218
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

01:24.718 --> 01:27.488
HEY, CHECK OUT THE BACK.

01:27.521 --> 01:30.791
YOU CAN SEE MY SKULL.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.710
SO, WHO DID THAT
TO HENRY'S HAIR?

01:50.311 --> 01:55.183
AW, YOU TOOK HIM TO
ONE OF THOSE PLACES
IN THE VILLAGE, DIDN'T YOU?

01:55.216 --> 01:59.387
WHERE THEY ALL
DRESS IN BLACK
AND NOBODY TALKS TO YOU.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.256
NO, NO. NO.
I TOOK HIM TO TONY.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.757
TONY? HE'S NOT
CAPABLE OF THAT.

02:03.791 --> 02:08.396
OH, COME ON, WALT.
DO NOT DEFEND THAT
BUTCHER IN THIS HOUSE.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.530
HE IS INCOMPETENT.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.565
BUT SEAN HAD A NICE
LITTLE TALK WITH HIM.

02:11.599 --> 02:13.701
I'M YELLIN' AT YOU
BECAUSE I'M AN ASS!

02:13.734 --> 02:16.204
I CAME BY YESTERDAY
WITH MY SON!

02:16.237 --> 02:18.239
GET OUT OF HERE.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.645
YOU SCREAMED AT TONY?

02:24.678 --> 02:27.881
THE MAN HAS BEEN
CUTTIN' MY HAIR
FOR 30 YEARS.

02:27.915 --> 02:31.419
SAME HAIRCUT,
FLAWLESS EVERY TIME.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.821
MAYBE IT'S TIME
FOR OLD TONY TO RETIRE.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.457
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
IT'S JUST A HAIRCUT.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.626
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUDDY.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.261
IT'S OK, RIGHT?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.395
OH, YEAH.
IT'LL GROW OUT.

02:41.429 --> 02:42.696
SURE.
EVENTUALLY.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.798
IT'S JUST HAIR.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.638
JIMMY, YOU GOTTA RELAX,
OR YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE US ALL AWAY.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.639
DAD, I CAN'T.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.908
I FEEL LIKE I'M
GETTING AN ULCER
OR SOMETHING.

02:54.942 --> 02:58.746
JIMMY, AT YOUR AGE,
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
INTESTINAL PARASITES.

02:58.779 --> 03:02.883
OH, OK.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

03:02.916 --> 03:04.017
LOOK. LOOK, OK?

03:04.051 --> 03:05.686
THIS WHOLE THING
STARTED WHEN CLAUDIA
GOT IT IN HER HEAD

03:05.719 --> 03:07.755
THAT I DON'T
CARRY MY SHARE.

03:07.788 --> 03:12.526
ALL RIGHT? AND YOU KNOW
HOW CONDESCENDING SHE CAN BE.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.329
SO YOU'RE GONNA GET HENRY
HIS HAIRCUT TODAY, RIGHT?

03:15.363 --> 03:17.265
YEAH. YEAH.
GO BACK FURTHER.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FORGET, ARE YOU?

03:19.367 --> 03:20.968
NO.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.806
Claudia: SEAN, LISTEN.
IT'S FOR HIS CHOIR RECITAL.

03:25.839 --> 03:28.642
PLEASE DON'T FORGET.
HE'S GOT A SOLO.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.778
WE'LL ACTUALLY GET TO
SEE HIM THIS TIME,

03:30.811 --> 03:31.912
AND HE REALLY
NEEDS A HAIRCUT.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.815
I KNOW, I KNOW,
I KNOW, OK?

03:34.848 --> 03:36.016
I'M NOT GONNA FORGET.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.386
'CAUSE YOU NEVER
FORGET ANYTHING, RIGHT?

03:38.419 --> 03:42.523
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

03:43.957 --> 03:45.993
YOU DID PICK UP JIMMY?

03:46.026 --> 03:48.796
YEAH. OF COURSE.

03:49.697 --> 03:53.801
OH, GOD. YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS LIKE ONE TIME.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.303
YO, ELWAY. CHUCK IT.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.638
ONE TIME? NO.
IT'S ALL THE TIME.

03:57.671 --> 04:01.409
IT'S THE GARBAGE
THAT DOESN'T GET
TAKEN OUT

04:01.442 --> 04:02.776
AND THE DOG THAT
DOESN'T GET WASHED.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.779
THE HALLOWEEN
DECORATIONS DON'T
GET TAKEN DOWN.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.348
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKIN' ABOUT?

04:07.381 --> 04:10.484
THERE'S A WITCH
ON OUR DOOR, SWEETIE.

04:10.818 --> 04:12.920
OH, OK.
THAT'S SO INSULTING.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.054
WELL, COME ON.
WHAT?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.891
THAT'S SO UNFAIR
FOR YOU TO SIT HERE
ON YOUR HIGH HOR--

04:17.925 --> 04:19.793
YOU KNOW, HOW DARE YOU?

04:19.827 --> 04:20.828
HOW DARE I?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.430
YES, HOW DARE YOU,

04:22.463 --> 04:25.666
LAYING THIS TRIP ON ME
LIKE I'M SOME
IRRESPONSIBLE BOOB

04:25.699 --> 04:27.735
WHO DOESN'T TAKE CARE
OF HIS FAMILY.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.069
Eddie: YO, SEAN.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.705
NO, NO, NO. YOU AND I
MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT
PRIORITIES, CLAUDIA, OK?

04:31.739 --> 04:34.308
BUT I AM A GOOD FATHER
AND A GOOD HUSBAND

04:34.342 --> 04:35.843
AND IF SOMETHING NEEDS
DOIN' AROUND HERE, OK,

04:35.876 --> 04:38.812
I ULTIMATELY
GET AROUND AND DO IT,

04:38.846 --> 04:41.549
AND I WOULD
APPRECIATE, OK,

04:41.582 --> 04:42.883
A LITTLE BIT OF THANKS

04:42.916 --> 04:45.386
AND JUST SOME KIND
OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THAT
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.920
YO, YO, YO, YO, YO.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.862
VERY STIRRING SPEECH!

04:54.895 --> 04:57.765
WELL, IT NEEDED TO BE SAID!

05:02.870 --> 05:04.472
HEY, LIL, CHECK IT OUT.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.373
THE TICKETS.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.708
YES!
WHO'S COOLER THAN
YOUR UNCLE EDWIN?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.677
THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.811
HOW DID YOU
GET THEM?

05:10.844 --> 05:11.745
I KNOW A GUY.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.414
YOU ALWAYS
KNOW A GUY.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.982
HOW MANY GUYS
DO YOU KNOW?

05:15.015 --> 05:17.885
I KNOW ABOUT 75 GUYS.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.721
THIS IS
SO FAR BEYOND COOL.

05:20.754 --> 05:21.689
Claudia:
WHAT IS?

05:21.722 --> 05:24.925
EDDIE GOT ME 4 TICKETS
TO THE NO DOUBT CONCERT.

05:24.958 --> 05:25.926
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.462
NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.430
IT'S AMAZING.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.932
IT'S TOTALLY SOLD OUT,
AND IT'S IN A TINY CLUB.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.867
IT'LL BE LIKE
THEY'RE IN OUR HOUSE.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.836
THAT IS AMAZING.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.671
NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

05:37.705 --> 05:38.772
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.775
IT'S A BENEFIT CONCERT,
ONLY 300 PEOPLE WILL BE THERE,

05:41.809 --> 05:44.845
AND ME AND MY FRIENDS
WILL BE FOUR OF THEM.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.113
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

05:46.146 --> 05:48.482
NO. IT'S GENIUS.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.316
I KNOW.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.820
OH, FORGET IT.
YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.987
OH, I UNDERSTAND.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.524
IT'S REALLY, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.224
I GET IT.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.893
YOU'RE NOT
GETTING THIS AT ALL.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.698
SO, IF YOU GOT HENRY
THE HAIRCUT,

06:04.732 --> 06:08.469
THEN WHY IS JIMMY
HIDING IN THE DRYER?

06:08.502 --> 06:09.837
WHAT?

06:09.870 --> 06:12.940
HEY, JIMMY, GET OUT
OF THERE. COME ON.

06:12.973 --> 06:13.841
THAT'S NOT SAFE.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.042
HEY, DAD, I WAS GONNA
GET HIM THE HAIRCUT,

06:15.075 --> 06:17.945
BUT I WASN'T GONNA
BLOW A WHOLE SATURDAY
ON IT, ALL RIGHT?

06:17.978 --> 06:19.447
SO I TOOK HIM TO THE MOVIES.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.981
DUDE, WHERE'S MY COKE?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.650
DUDE, WHERE'S MY SHOE?

06:22.683 --> 06:23.817
DUDE, WHERE'S MY BUTT?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.085
DUDE, WHERE'S MY DUDE?

06:25.118 --> 06:25.953
OK, THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.455
COME ON. WE GOTTA
GET TO THE BARBERSHOP.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.088
LET'S GO, GUYS.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.990
HOW LONG
WAS THE MOVIE?

06:30.023 --> 06:34.695
WELL, IT WASN'T
JUST THE MOVIE.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.131
LET ME TRY
THE VERY VERY BERRY.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.902
LOOK, YOU CAN'T TASTE
EVERY FLAVOR IN THE STORE.

06:41.935 --> 06:46.073
OH, NO. ACTUALLY,
WE BETTER GET GOING
TO THE BARBERSHOP.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.775
SORRY.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.648
AND THEN YOU WENT
TO THE BARBERSHOP.

06:54.682 --> 06:57.150
YEAH, WELL...UH, WELL,

06:57.184 --> 07:01.622
YEAH, NOT STRAIGHT THERE.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.792
WE...YEAH.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.426
NO.

07:06.894 --> 07:07.861
COME ON.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.930
PUSH THE BUTTON ALREADY.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.532
UH, DAD?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.734
YOU KNOW,
WE'RE IN FRONT
OF THE TAPE.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.235
ARE YOU SURE
THAT IT'S SAFE?

07:15.268 --> 07:17.004
JIMMY, THE SET THE TAPE
WAY FAR BACK.

07:17.037 --> 07:17.938
IT'S FOR INSURANCE.

07:17.971 --> 07:19.072
IT'S LIKE MILK.

07:19.106 --> 07:21.609
YOU CAN DRINK IT
WEEKS AFTER THAT DATE
THEY PUT ON IT.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.776
Sean: ALL RIGHT!

07:22.810 --> 07:26.747
SHOWTIME.
WHOO!

07:30.784 --> 07:32.085
AWESOME.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.320
CHECK OUT THE DUST CLOUD.

07:33.353 --> 07:38.058
DAD, ARE YOU SURE
THAT IT'S SAFE TO BE
IN FRONT OF THE LINE?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.960
YEAH.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.730
RUN!

07:45.999 --> 07:48.702
I THINK I MAY
HAVE BLACK LUNG.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.939
I THINK I'VE GOT BLOWN-UP
PIECES OF RAT ON ME.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.108
THEY PUT
THAT YELLOW LINE
WAY TOO CLOSE.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.845
OH, NO.

07:59.046 --> 08:01.582
SO YOU FRITTERED AWAY
A WHOLE DAY?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.584
WE WERE HAVING FUN,
AND THEN WE GOT
TO THIS PLACE,

08:03.617 --> 08:04.918
AND THE BARBERSHOP
WAS CLOSED,

08:04.952 --> 08:06.119
AND YOU KNOW CLAUDIA.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.688
I KNEW HOW MUCH
SHE WAS FREAKING OUT

08:07.721 --> 08:09.790
ABOUT HENRY GETTING
HIS HAIR CUT FOR THE RECITAL,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.592
AND THEN I THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.627
HOW HARD COULD IT BE?

08:13.661 --> 08:16.029
HUH

08:18.265 --> 08:19.266
ALL RIGHT.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.300
OH, WOW.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.101
WHAT, WOW?

08:21.134 --> 08:22.069
THAT WAS A BIG CLUMP.

08:22.102 --> 08:26.106
I'M GONNA DO
THE SAME THING
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

08:31.078 --> 08:31.845
VOILA.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.013
HOW DOES IT LOOK?

08:33.046 --> 08:34.047
Eddie: UH-OH.

08:34.081 --> 08:34.982
WHAT, UH

08:35.015 --> 08:36.016
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.050
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:37.084 --> 08:39.219
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WOULD HAVE DONE.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.655
ISN'T IT EASIER
TO CUT IT
IF IT'S WET?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.123
YES. GOOD POINT.
YES. WET.

08:43.156 --> 08:46.059
HEY, HAND ME
THAT SPRAY BOTTLE
RIGHT THERE.

08:46.093 --> 08:49.129
THAT'S GOOD.
GOOD DEAL.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.030
AAH! OW!

08:50.063 --> 08:51.632
THAT'S WINDEX.

08:51.665 --> 08:55.535
OH, GOD! OH!
SORRY, HENRY.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.774
OK. OK.
LOOKING GOOD.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.275
LOOKIN' CROOKED.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.579
YOU HAVE TO USE THE EARS
TO CALIBRATE.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.479
I'M USING THE EARS.

09:06.513 --> 09:07.915
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE USING THE EARS.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.217
LOOK, IF ANYTHING,
I'M OVER-RELYING
ON THE EARS.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.853
JUST PUT THE SCISSORS DOWN
AND WALK AWAY.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.722
I CAN'T. I CAN'T.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.081
YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.350
I GOTTA FLUFF.
I JUST GOTTA FLUFF.

09:47.855 --> 09:49.022
OK. WE GOT SOME BODY.

09:49.056 --> 09:52.192
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO RIGHT HERE?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.761
WHERE?

09:53.794 --> 09:56.029
Jimmy:
HE'S GOT A BALD SPOT.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.632
HEY, IT'S GOOD,
HENRY.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.200
IT MAKES YOU
LOOK OLDER.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.336
SO YOU JUST DUMPED THE HAIR
DOWN THE DISPOSAL?

10:03.370 --> 10:06.640
WELL, I FIGURED
IF CLAUDIA COULDN'T
FIND THE EVIDENCE,

10:06.674 --> 10:07.274
THEN, YOU KNOW,

10:07.307 --> 10:08.408
SHE WOULD
NEVER KNOW.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.178
SHE COULD LOOK AT HIS HEAD.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.115
YEAH. YEAH,
AND SHE DID.

10:15.148 --> 10:19.086
* IN MY HAND
NO PRICE I BRING *

10:19.119 --> 10:24.091
* SIMPLY TO THY CROSS
I CLING *

10:24.124 --> 10:26.226
* ROCK OF AGES

10:26.259 --> 10:28.028
* CLEFT TO ME

10:28.061 --> 10:31.732
* LET ME HIDE MYSELF
IN THEE *

10:31.765 --> 10:35.335
OH, MY GOD. WHAT HAPPENED
TO HENRY'S HAIR?

10:35.368 --> 10:35.969
UH...

10:36.003 --> 10:38.205
TONY THE BARBER
WAS DRUNK.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.974
YEAH.

10:41.008 --> 10:44.377
* BE OF SIN
THE DOUBLE CURE *

10:44.411 --> 10:49.282
* SAVE FROM WRATH
AND MAKE ME PURE *

10:49.316 --> 10:57.224
* SAVE FROM WRATH
AND MAKE ME PURE *

10:59.092 --> 11:02.095
SO, JIMBO CAME THROUGH
WITH AN EXCELLENT STORY,

11:02.129 --> 11:03.897
AND I WAS OFF THE HOOK.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.066
WHAT A PROUD DAY.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.203
DAD, LISTEN. I CAN'T
KEEP LYING LIKE THIS.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.238
I WANT TO
TELL THE TRUTH.

11:11.271 --> 11:14.441
HEY, HEY, HEY. JIMMY,
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, OK?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.977
SO IF I GO DOWN,
YOU GO DOWN.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.212
WHY? I DIDN'T
CUT HENRY'S HAIR.

11:19.246 --> 11:20.147
YOU DIDN'T STOP US.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.316
THAT MAKES YOU
AN ACCESSORY
AFTER THE FACT.

11:26.253 --> 11:31.291
HEY, KRISTINA. WHATCHA
DOIN' SATURDAY NIGHT?

11:31.324 --> 11:33.260
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
GUESS WHAT I GOT.

11:33.293 --> 11:37.264
YEAH. SOMETHING TOTALLY
BEYOND COOL JUST HAPPENED.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.032
I GOT...

11:40.167 --> 11:42.702
SEE, I GOT...

11:43.203 --> 11:45.873
I GOTTA GO.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.476
WHY DIDN'T YOU
ASK HER
TO THE CONCERT?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.478
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK HER.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.480
KRISTINA IS
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.883
EXACTLY.
SHE ALREADY LIKES ME.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.986
WHAT DO I HAVE TO GAIN
BY INVITING HER?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.188
IT WOULD JUST BE
A WASTE OF A TICKET.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.290
I MEAN, THESE THINGS
COULD BE MY KEY

12:03.323 --> 12:05.125
TO POPULARITY FOREVER,

12:05.158 --> 12:09.029
AND I ALMOST BLEW ONE
ON MY FRIEND.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.531
HEY, LIL.
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT--

12:11.564 --> 12:15.168
WHOA. WHAT IS IT, JIMMY?

12:15.502 --> 12:16.436
WHAT?

12:16.469 --> 12:17.971
HA HA. THERE'S
A SOFTENER SHEET
ON YOUR BACK,

12:18.005 --> 12:20.774
WHICH MEANS YOU'VE BEEN
IN THE DRYER, WHICH MEANS
YOU'VE BEEN HIDING FROM ME,

12:20.808 --> 12:24.244
WHICH MEAN YOU'RE
KEEPING SOMETHING FROM ME.
WHAT IS IT?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.113
NOTHING.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.415
ARE YOU LYIN'?

12:29.116 --> 12:32.085
YES.
MM-HMM.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.256
OK, UNCLE EDDIE,
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS,

12:36.289 --> 12:38.058
SO YOU'VE GOT TO
HELP ME OUT.

12:38.091 --> 12:38.758
WHAT?

12:38.792 --> 12:39.860
ALL RIGHT.
THESE ARE THE NAMES

12:39.893 --> 12:42.529
OF EVERYBODY I COULD
POSSIBLY INVITE
TO THE CONCERT.

12:42.562 --> 12:43.696
THE BLUE PEOPLE ARE
MY ACTUAL FRIENDS,

12:43.730 --> 12:46.466
THE RED PEOPLE
ARE POPULAR PEOPLE
WHO KINDA KNOW ME,

12:46.499 --> 12:51.338
AND THE GREEN PEOPLE
ARE POPULAR PEOPLE
WHO DON'T LIKE ME.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.006
OK.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.308
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, IF I INVITE
MORE THAN ONE GREEN,

12:55.342 --> 12:56.376
THEY'LL JUST
TALK TO EACH OTHER,

12:56.409 --> 12:58.011
AND I'LL END UP WITH
A BLUE OR A RED.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.413
AND THE RED WOULD
PROBABLY JUST GO
OVER TO THE GREEN,

13:00.447 --> 13:01.381
SO THAT WON'T WORK.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.216
BUT IF I INVITE
AN EXTRA BLUE
FOR INSURANCE,

13:03.250 --> 13:04.852
THE GREEN PERSON
WON'T EVEN COME,

13:04.885 --> 13:06.053
SO I MIGHT AS WELL
NOT EVEN RISK IT

13:06.086 --> 13:08.088
AND JUST INVITE
BLUES AND REDS
AND NO GREENS,

13:08.121 --> 13:10.457
BUT THAT WOULD BE
SUCH A WASTE,
WOULDN'T IT?

13:10.490 --> 13:13.994
WHO'S GREEN AGAIN?

13:14.027 --> 13:16.964
POPULAR PEOPLE
WHO DON'T LIKE ME.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.867
OK. WHY DON'T YOU JUST--

13:19.900 --> 13:21.001
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHO'S BLUE?

13:21.034 --> 13:25.038
OH! YOU ARE USELESS!

13:25.305 --> 13:27.975
RUB IT IN, WHY DON'T YOU?

13:28.008 --> 13:31.144
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
HE GAVE HENRY THAT HAIRCUT.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.245
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS.

13:32.279 --> 13:35.548
WELL, YOU, YOU LYING TO ME,
THAT'S WHAT THREW ME OFF.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.585
MOM, I REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO,

13:38.618 --> 13:42.622
BUT DAD TOLD ME
IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.157
OK. THAT LOOKS OK, RIGHT?

13:44.191 --> 13:45.058
Jimmy: NO.

13:45.092 --> 13:48.028
LILY, GIVE ME THAT HAT.
COME ON. COME ON.

13:48.061 --> 13:48.929
WHY?

13:48.962 --> 13:52.165
'CAUSE HENRY NEED TO
BORROW IT, THAT'S WHY.

13:52.665 --> 13:56.336
OH, YEAH. YEAH.
THAT DOESN'T
LOOK STUPID AT ALL.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.038
WHERE'S A MIRROR?

13:58.071 --> 14:00.273
OH! UM...OH.

14:00.307 --> 14:01.641
MOM IS GONNA
FREAK OUT.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.078
LOOK, NOT IF SHE
DOESN'T FIND OUT
HOW IT HAPPENED, OK?

14:05.112 --> 14:06.113
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.115
LITTLE LIFE LESSON,
ALL RIGHT?

14:08.148 --> 14:09.182
THERE ARE
CERTAIN SITUATIONS,

14:09.216 --> 14:10.884
AND THIS IS
A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF ONE OF THEM, OK,

14:10.918 --> 14:12.519
WHERE THE BEST BET
FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED

14:12.552 --> 14:16.256
IS THAT WHAT WE DO IS,
WE...UH, WE LIE.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.358
BUT YOU ALWAYS
TELL US NOT TO LIE.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.427
YOU YELL AT US
WHEN WE LIE.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.195
OK, BUT THIS IS
A WHITE LIE, ALL RIGHT,

14:22.229 --> 14:22.963
AND THAT'S
THE KIND OF LIE

14:22.996 --> 14:23.863
WHERE YOU SPARE
SOMEONE'S FEELING,

14:23.897 --> 14:25.498
AND WE'RE SPARING
YOUR MOTHER'S FEELINGS.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.666
HOW?
WELL, WE'RE KEEPING HER

14:26.699 --> 14:28.601
FROM FEELING BAD THAT
SHE MARRIED AN IDIOT.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.204
NOT LYING'S
LIKE A COMMANDMENT.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.606
YEAH? WELL, SO IS
HONORING THY FATHER, OK?

14:33.640 --> 14:36.543
AND THAT'S,
LIKE, MUCH HIGHER,

14:36.576 --> 14:38.345
OK? SO, LOOK.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.113
ARE YOU GUYS WITH ME
ON THIS ONE?

14:40.147 --> 14:41.214
I DON'T KNOW.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.149
OH, COME ON. JIMMY,

14:42.182 --> 14:43.216
JIMMY, JIMMY,
LISTEN TO ME.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.551
YOU GOTTA
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.987
YOUR MOTHER
IS A WOMAN, OK,

14:47.020 --> 14:48.688
AND SHE KEEPS SCORE
EVERY TIME I SCREW UP,

14:48.721 --> 14:52.125
AND THIS AFTERNOON,
I LOBBED A BIG MEATBALL
ACROSS THE PLATE,

14:52.159 --> 14:55.128
SO I HAVE TO ASK
ONE THING OF YOU,
SON, OK?

14:55.162 --> 14:57.430
JUST DON'T
FREAK OUT ON ME!

14:58.598 --> 15:01.001
AND HE THOUGHT
I WASN'T GONNA
FIGURE THAT OUT?

15:01.034 --> 15:04.471
YOU DIDN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
I TOLD YOU.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.273
WELL, HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.076
SEE? NOW YOU'RE
MAKING ME LIE.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.543
NO, NO, NO.
IT'S OK, JIMMY,

15:10.577 --> 15:13.346
'CAUSE I'M ASKING YOU
TO LIE ABOUT A LIE.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.414
IT JUST CANCELS IT OUT.

15:14.447 --> 15:18.585
YOUR DAD, THOUGH,
ASKED YOU TO LIE
ABOUT THE TRUTH,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.620
AND THAT IS JUST WRONG.

15:20.653 --> 15:25.192
FOR THAT,
HE WILL SUFFER.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.528
OK, UNCLE EDDIE.
I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.630
YOU READY?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.331
OK. OK.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.100
SO I INVITE
JULIE AND LAUREN.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.168
NOW, JULIE HATES LAUREN,
SO SHE WON'T GO,

15:35.202 --> 15:37.170
BUT I'LL STILL
GET POINTS FOR ASKING.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.138
NOW, KIM WILL GO,

15:38.171 --> 15:40.173
BUT SHE'LL WANT TO BRING
HER BOYFRIEND BRANDON,

15:40.207 --> 15:42.609
BUT THAT'S OK,
'CAUSE HE'S CAPTAIN
OF THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.612
NOW, HE DOESN'T
GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT
JASON AND DAVID,

15:45.645 --> 15:47.647
AND THEY EACH
HAVE GIRLFRIENDS,
WHICH IS FINE,

15:47.680 --> 15:48.915
'CAUSE ONCE I'M IN WITH
THAT CROWD, I'M SET.

15:48.948 --> 15:53.053
SO I GET LAUREN, KIM,
BRANDON, JASON, DAVID,
ALLISON, MARILEE,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.622
HER LITTLE SISTER,
AND HER SISTER'S
FRIENDS, GAIL AND TRACY,

15:55.655 --> 15:59.359
AND ALL I NEED FROM YOU
IS 7 MORE TICKETS.

16:00.760 --> 16:03.263
I CAN'T GET
7 MORE TICKETS.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.564
I CAN WORK WITH 5.

16:04.597 --> 16:07.167
I CAN'T GET
ANY MORE TICKETS.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.337
3?
NO. NONE. ZERO.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.738
AAH!

16:11.771 --> 16:13.706
YEAH. TELL ME ABOUT IT.

16:13.740 --> 16:17.277
IT'S SO FUNNY. TWO DAYS AGO,
THAT DRAIN WAS WORKING FINE.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.481
IT SURE WILL BE INTERESTING
TO SEE WHAT'S CLOGGED DOWN
THERE, WON'T IT?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.315
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:22.349 --> 16:23.516
YOU GOT SO MUCH STUFF
TO DO, CLAUDIA.

16:23.550 --> 16:27.087
YOU DON'T WANT TO
HANG OUT AND WATCH US
UNCLOG THE DRAIN.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.255
NO. I'M INTERESTED.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.457
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.424
YEAH. LILY,

16:31.458 --> 16:33.226
SHE PUTS PAPER TOWELS
DOWN THERE ALL THE TIME.

16:33.260 --> 16:37.430
I'M GONNA GO GIVE THAT GIRL
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.198
UH...

16:38.231 --> 16:40.267
UH--DON'T--UH--
DON'T--UH--DON'T--

16:40.300 --> 16:41.000
YOU KNOW,
DON'T DO THAT,

16:41.034 --> 16:43.636
BECAUSE, UH, WELL,
IT WASN'T HER.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.472
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

16:45.505 --> 16:46.639
WELL, BECAUSE,

16:46.673 --> 16:49.809
YOU KNOW, I WAS--
I JUST SO HAPPENED
TO BE WATCHING HER,

16:49.842 --> 16:51.111
OK, BEFORE,

16:51.144 --> 16:54.247
AND SHE WASN'T
DOING THAT.

16:55.115 --> 16:55.848
YOU KNOW?

16:55.882 --> 16:57.484
SO YOU'VE BEEN
GUARDING THE DRAIN?

16:57.517 --> 17:00.787
HA HA!
YOU MEAN LIKE--NO.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.289
NO. NO.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.623
I WAS--NO.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.826
IF IT'S NOT PAPER TOWELS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT COULD POSSIBLY BE,

17:06.859 --> 17:08.761
UNLESS IT WAS HENRY'S HAIR
THAT YOU CUT YOURSELF

17:08.795 --> 17:11.598
AND THEN TRIED TO FLUSH
DOWN THE DISPOSAL.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.405
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.373
IT WAS LILY AND
THOSE DAMN PAPER TOWELS.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.774
IT WAS NOT
LILY'S DAMN PAPER TOWELS.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.610
SEE, I KNEW
YOU WERE GONNA MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.346
HOW COULD I NOT MAKE
A BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS?

17:26.379 --> 17:29.282
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID,
"HOW DARE YOU?

17:29.316 --> 17:31.284
HOW DARE YOU QUESTION
MY COMPETENCE?"

17:31.318 --> 17:33.653
OH, THERE'S NO WAY
I SAID, "HOW DARE YOU."

17:33.686 --> 17:35.255
OH, I THINK YOU DID.

17:35.288 --> 17:38.325
HOW DARE YOU!

17:38.358 --> 17:39.526
HERE, EDDIE.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.365
I DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.633
YOU'RE AMAZING, SEAN.

17:46.666 --> 17:50.103
AND 2 HOURS AGO,
GIVEN THE CHOICE OF
JUST TELLING ME THE TRUTH

17:50.137 --> 17:51.404
OR YELLING AT POOR OLD TONY,

17:51.438 --> 17:52.139
YOU YELLED AT TONY.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.674
OK. THAT MIGHT
NOT HAVE GONE DOWN

17:54.707 --> 17:58.345
EXACTLY THE WAY YOU
MAY HAVE PERCEIVED IT
TO HAVE.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.580
CLAUD. CLAUD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

18:00.613 --> 18:02.249
I'M GOING TO TONY'S.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.216
WHY?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.484
I'M GONNA
PLUNGE HIS SCISSORS
INTO HIS NECK.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.553
OH, NO, CLAUD.
CLAUDIA, DON'T DO THIS.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.355
AFTER THAT HAIRCUT
HE GAVE HENRY?

18:08.388 --> 18:10.457
NO, NO. COME ON. COME ON.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.392
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.461
I CARE.
THEN WHY
AREN'T YOU ANGRY?

18:14.494 --> 18:15.428
OH, I'M ANGRY.

18:15.462 --> 18:16.729
I WANT TO GO IN THERE
AND TEAR HIM A NEW ONE.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.531
I WANT TO GO TEAR HIM
TWO NEW ONES.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.367
JUST LET ME DO IT, OK?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.569
OK.
OK.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.738
TONY.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.839
SEAN.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.775
LISTEN, YOU'VE DONE
NOTHIN' WRONG,
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

18:28.808 --> 18:29.676
NOTHIN' AT ALL.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.378
YEAH?
YEAH. YEAH,

18:31.411 --> 18:32.312
AND I CAME BY
YESTERDAY

18:32.345 --> 18:33.313
WITH MY BOY
TO GET A HAIRCUT

18:33.346 --> 18:34.381
BUT YOU WERE CLOSED,

18:34.414 --> 18:35.182
SO I GAVE HIM
A HAIRCUT,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.015
AND IT WAS THE WORST
FREAKIN' HAIRCUT

18:36.048 --> 18:38.251
IN THE HISTORY OF
HAIRCUTS--THE WORST!

18:38.285 --> 18:39.819
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
YELLIN' AT ME FOR?

18:39.852 --> 18:41.154
WHY AM I
YELLIN' AT YOU?

18:41.188 --> 18:41.854
BECAUSE I'M AN ASS,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.356
AND I'M TRYIN'
TO SAVE MY BUTT,

18:43.390 --> 18:44.424
AND YOU SEE THAT
WOMAN OUT THERE?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.492
SHE'S MARRIED TO ME,
OK,

18:45.525 --> 18:47.627
SO YOU LET ME YELL
AT YOU FOR JUST
A MINUTE LONGER,

18:47.660 --> 18:48.861
SHE MIGHT NOT
KILL ME!

18:48.895 --> 18:49.896
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND ME,

18:49.929 --> 18:52.465
YOU PERFECTLY NICE
SON OF A BITCH?

18:52.499 --> 18:54.501
PLEASE, GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.203
YOU--

18:59.839 --> 19:03.576
AND I'LL PAY FOR THAT
NEXT TIME I'M IN!

19:09.916 --> 19:11.918
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

19:11.951 --> 19:12.952
WELL, I WAS THINKING

19:12.985 --> 19:15.322
I'D RATHER HAVE
A BARBER MAD AT ME
THAN MY WIFE.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.457
YEAH. OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

19:17.490 --> 19:22.795
YOU ONLY GET
ONE HAIRCUT A YEAR,
YOU DIRTY HIPPIE.

19:23.596 --> 19:27.567
OK. HERE'S THE HAIRBALL.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.570
IT LOOKS LIKE A DEAD SQUIRREL.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.705
YEAH, IT DOES.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.474
CAN I HAVE IT?

19:34.507 --> 19:35.608
NO! NO, NO.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.344
BUT IT CAME OFF OF ME.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.778
NO, HENRY. NO.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.447
OH!

19:40.480 --> 19:41.681
OH, COME ON.

19:41.714 --> 19:47.520
IT WAS LIKE MOM
COULD SEE RIGHT INTO
THE CENTER OF MY SOUL...

19:47.554 --> 19:52.292
AND WHAT SHE SAW THERE
WAS THIS HARD EVIL,

19:52.325 --> 19:56.496
AND IT BURNED
MY INSIDES LIKE FIRE.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.732
YEAH, BUT YOU
GET USED TO IT.

19:59.766 --> 20:03.370
HOW COULD YOU
DO THIS TO ME?

20:03.403 --> 20:05.505
DO WHAT TO YOU?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.407
GIVE ME 4 TICKETS.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.610
UH, YOU BEGGED FOR THEM?

20:10.643 --> 20:13.280
THINK, UNCLE EDDIE.
4 TICKETS.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.447
THE MATH DOESN'T WORK.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.448
SURE, I GET 3 NEW FRIENDS,

20:15.482 --> 20:17.950
BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
EVERYBODY ELSE FINDS OUT?

20:17.984 --> 20:19.252
I'LL BE RUINED.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.454
HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I HAD TO GO THROUGH
TO GET THOSE TICKETS?

20:21.488 --> 20:23.323
MAJOR FAVORS
WERE CALLED IN.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.925
A FED EX EMPLOYEE
RISKED HIS JOB.

20:25.958 --> 20:31.698
2 STRIPPERS HAD TO
MAKE A LATE NIGHT TRIP
TO JERSEY.

20:31.731 --> 20:32.765
DO NOT ASK ME WHY.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.968
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO
BE ABOUT YOU, UNCLE EDDIE?

20:36.002 --> 20:37.904
WHAT ABOUT ME?

20:40.307 --> 20:41.941
SHE'S WEIRD.

20:42.875 --> 20:43.576
YOU SAID IT.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.612
HEY, YOU WANT TO
GO SCALP THESE?

20:45.645 --> 20:46.245
SURE.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.614
ALL RIGHT.
PUT A JACKET ON

20:47.647 --> 20:49.849
AND SOME SHOES
YOU CAN RUN IN.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.484
Sean: CLAUD. CLAUD.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.052
CLAUDIA. CLAUDIA.
CLAUDIA, I'M SORRY.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.421
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE SORRY.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.455
WELL, WHAT
DO YOU WANT?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.557
I JUST WANT YOU TO DO
THE STUFF I WANT YOU TO DO.

20:57.590 --> 20:58.625
YEAH. I WANT TO DO
THOSE THINGS.

20:58.658 --> 20:59.959
REALLY. I WOULD
LOVE TO BE THE GUY

20:59.992 --> 21:01.428
THAT WANTS TO DO
THOSE THINGS,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.194
BUT I JUST CAN'T,

21:02.228 --> 21:04.431
OK, BECAUSE I'M
NOT GOOD AT THEM.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.665
I'M JUST NOT
PROGRAMMED THAT WAY,
YOU KNOW?

21:05.698 --> 21:08.435
IF SOMEONE'S
BLEEDIN',
I'M RIGHT THERE.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.469
FIX A BICYCLE, SURE.

21:09.502 --> 21:12.071
YOU KNOW, PICK
SOMETHING HEAVY
UP OFF THE GROUND

21:12.104 --> 21:14.474
AND PUT IT
SOMEWHERE.
THAT'S ME,

21:14.507 --> 21:17.510
OK? BECAUSE THOSE
ARE THE THINGS
I'M GOOD AT,

21:17.544 --> 21:18.378
BUT THE
TERRIFIC THING IS,

21:18.411 --> 21:20.480
IS THAT YOU'RE GREAT
AT THE OTHER THINGS,

21:20.513 --> 21:22.415
AND THAT'S WHY I'M
SUCH A LUCKY GUY.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.517
IT'S LIKE
THE YIN-YANG,
YOU KNOW?

21:24.551 --> 21:26.453
YOU AND THE THINGS
THAT YOU DO,

21:26.486 --> 21:28.521
YOU HOLD THIS FAMILY
TOGETHER,

21:28.555 --> 21:30.457
LIKE REMEMBERING
BIRTHDAYS

21:30.490 --> 21:32.625
OR BUYING CLOTHES

21:32.659 --> 21:38.598
OR MAKING
THOSE TASTY,
BALANCED LUNCHES

21:38.631 --> 21:39.399
FOR OUR LITTLE ONES,

21:39.432 --> 21:41.601
AND THAT'S WHY I'M
SUCH A LUCKY GUY,

21:41.634 --> 21:42.902
AND I'M
IN AWE OF YOU

21:42.935 --> 21:44.103
BECAUSE
YOU'RE AMAZING.

21:44.136 --> 21:48.975
YOU DON'T REALLY
THINK I'M BUYING
ANY OF THIS CRAP, DO YOU?

21:50.643 --> 21:52.579
YEAH. OK.

21:58.017 --> 21:58.818
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
TONY

21:58.851 --> 22:00.887
OF COURSE HE CAN FIX IT.
HE'S THE KING.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.689
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.056
AW, COME ON, GUYS.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.726
THERE'S NOTHIN'
TO WORK WITH ON THE SIDES.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.627
MOHAWK.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.095
YEAH. MOHAWK.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.063
YEAH. MOHAWKS
ARE BACK BIG-TIME.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.098
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.099
Tony: I GOTTA BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

22:13.132 --> 22:16.035
WE MIGHT AS WELL
SHAVE HIM BALD
AND START FRESH.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.937
I WANT TO BE BALD.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.872
WHOA. I'M NOT
PAYING YOU
TO MAKE HIM BALD.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.040
I CAN MAKE HIM BALD.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.008
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.010
SEAN, PUT THAT DOWN.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.913
NOW.
