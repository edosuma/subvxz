03:51.497 --> 03:52.431
Remember.

04:22.194 --> 04:23.696
You still have it.

04:26.197 --> 04:28.133
I've
never taken it off.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.104
1996.

04:36.608 --> 04:40.446
You were the most
radiantly beautiful,

04:41.879 --> 04:46.286
pig-tailed girl in all of
Shadowbrook Elementary.

04:49.788 --> 04:51.223
Everything changed that year.

04:54.192 --> 04:56.428
Why did you wait so long?

04:57.862 --> 04:59.531
Why did we wait so long, Ryan?

05:00.665 --> 05:03.035
I don't know.

05:03.067 --> 05:04.503
I think I was afraid

05:07.805 --> 05:09.675
that it might change things,

05:14.178 --> 05:15.180
that I might

05:17.014 --> 05:17.849
lose you

05:19.350 --> 05:20.185
in the end.

05:32.497 --> 05:35.735
I don't know if I
can do it, if I can

05:36.834 --> 05:37.936
watch you go.

05:46.845 --> 05:47.646
Here.

06:07.331 --> 06:10.168
We have all the
time in the world.

06:11.836 --> 06:13.171
Believe in me.

07:13.564 --> 07:14.966
Yeah, hello?

07:15.000 --> 07:16.502
Ryan, it's
Geoff.

07:16.535 --> 07:17.903
Geoff?

07:17.935 --> 07:19.137
You gotta hurry.

07:19.170 --> 07:22.574
You gotta hurry.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.008
Hello?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.343
Ryan, can you hear me?

07:57.375 --> 07:58.610
Yeah, Geoff, I can hear you.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.312
There's
a bomb at the lab.

08:00.345 --> 08:02.047
There's some crazy guy.

08:02.079 --> 08:04.483
He's got a bomb inside
the event chamber.

08:04.516 --> 08:05.718
A what?

08:05.750 --> 08:08.453
Is Dr. Webb
with you?

08:09.788 --> 08:12.490
Caitlin.

08:12.524 --> 08:13.358
Caitlin?

08:14.992 --> 08:15.827
Cate?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.077
Hi, this
is Dr. Caitlin Webb.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.712
I'm not available to
take your call right now.

08:37.349 --> 08:38.183
Please.

08:39.183 --> 08:40.653
Please.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.120
Hi, this
is Dr. Caitlin Webb...

09:10.349 --> 09:11.182
Ryan!

09:15.453 --> 09:17.155
Dr. Winrich, thank God.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.559
Caitlin.

09:21.025 --> 09:21.926
Where is she?

09:25.864 --> 09:26.699
Ryan?

09:27.732 --> 09:28.933
Ryan, no.

09:28.966 --> 09:31.135
- Hey, hey, sir, sir!
- Come back here.

09:31.168 --> 09:32.904
- Ryan, you can't go in there!
- Ryan, wait!

09:38.710 --> 09:40.646
I got a code 80,
Temporal Science building.

09:40.678 --> 09:42.047
Come on.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.318
He's goin' up.

09:55.693 --> 09:58.296
Warning, warning.

09:58.330 --> 10:01.233
Evacuation protocols
are now in effect.

10:01.265 --> 10:03.269
Please proceed to
the emergency exits.

10:09.073 --> 10:11.209
Dispatch we are
10-74 on that runner.

10:12.844 --> 10:13.846
Hey!

10:13.879 --> 10:16.148
Hey, stop right there!

10:16.181 --> 10:16.982
Freeze!

10:22.120 --> 10:23.956
Terminal lock engaged.

11:05.629 --> 11:07.432
It's never gonna
be the same now.

11:09.134 --> 11:11.504
It's never gonna be the
same and it's our fault.

11:12.770 --> 11:14.472
- Caitlin.
- No.

11:14.505 --> 11:16.107
We let him go, Ryan.

11:17.274 --> 11:18.810
We were selfish,
and now he's gone.

11:20.211 --> 11:21.346
I can't do this.

11:22.346 --> 11:23.649
Ryan, please don't!

11:49.740 --> 11:51.309
You're not gonna stop, are you?

11:54.111 --> 11:55.747
I can't stop.

11:58.450 --> 12:01.787
Not now, not when
we're so close.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.855
Nate would never
forgive us if we did.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.356
He's gone, Ryan.

12:05.389 --> 12:07.759
Don't you see where
this is going?

12:07.793 --> 12:10.461
Bill and now Nate, I
can't lose you too.

12:10.495 --> 12:11.730
You're all I have left.

12:11.763 --> 12:14.399
It's not just
about us anymore.

12:16.301 --> 12:18.370
Don't you see where this leads?

12:18.403 --> 12:19.805
They don't have to die!

12:21.105 --> 12:22.140
Once we figure this thing out,

12:22.173 --> 12:23.375
there's nothing that says

12:23.408 --> 12:24.543
- they have to die, Caitlin!
- Ryan,

12:24.576 --> 12:26.245
stop and listen to yourself.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.279
Our whole lives, everything,

12:28.312 --> 12:30.149
everything has led up to this.

12:30.182 --> 12:32.484
How can you ask me to
turn and walk away?

12:32.517 --> 12:34.353
You think that Nate
would walk away, or Bill?

12:34.385 --> 12:35.820
Think of what they sacrificed!

12:35.854 --> 12:37.689
So are you doing this
for them, Ryan, or for you?

12:37.721 --> 12:39.457
I don't know!

12:39.490 --> 12:41.393
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore!

12:47.198 --> 12:48.800
If I ask you to stop,

12:54.272 --> 12:55.775
if I ask you to stop,

12:57.142 --> 12:58.777
will you stop?

13:01.312 --> 13:02.480
How?

13:03.948 --> 13:04.982
How can I?

13:09.086 --> 13:11.889
How can I?

13:11.923 --> 13:14.293
I can't lose you, Ryan.

13:14.326 --> 13:15.461
You won't.

13:17.596 --> 13:19.597
We're gonna be together.

13:20.865 --> 13:22.266
I promise.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.405
Once I finish this.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.818
So that's it then?

13:41.919 --> 13:42.887
That's your choice?

13:44.755 --> 13:45.591
Caitlin.

13:48.393 --> 13:50.596
Caitlin.

14:25.629 --> 14:26.999
Power up the portal.

14:27.032 --> 14:27.966
We have work to do.

14:34.773 --> 14:35.541
Warning, warning,

14:36.707 --> 14:39.443
accelerator activation
sequence initiated.

14:39.476 --> 14:41.112
Nate gave us the clue.

14:41.145 --> 14:42.880
Analysis of the portal
after the accident

14:42.913 --> 14:45.417
showed a transport
over 75 years' time.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.052
He solved the pulse
resonance problem

14:48.086 --> 14:51.123
by altering the number of
dimensions in the equation.

14:51.155 --> 14:54.025
So he was right all along.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.528
Now all that's
left for us to do

14:57.562 --> 14:59.364
is to stabilize the
carrier frequency

14:59.397 --> 15:02.067
so the tissue samples
stay viable upon re-entry.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.068
If we can do that...

15:06.004 --> 15:07.740
What are you
standing around for?

15:13.345 --> 15:15.346
Let's make it happen.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.739
Emergence successful.

16:47.739 --> 16:49.742
Cellular cohesion intact.

16:50.774 --> 16:52.244
Quantum incoherence nominal.

16:53.278 --> 16:55.581
Tachyon syncopation achieved.

17:01.852 --> 17:02.653
So,

17:03.620 --> 17:04.454
did we do it?

17:05.623 --> 17:06.857
We'll know in a moment.

17:21.972 --> 17:23.075
It worked.

17:26.644 --> 17:29.713
There's only
one thing left to do.

17:37.821 --> 17:38.723
Good luck, Edward.

17:41.425 --> 17:43.828
Warning, warning!

17:43.862 --> 17:46.098
Biological organism detected.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.500
Do you wish to override
safety protocols?

17:51.035 --> 17:52.204
Here we go.

17:58.509 --> 18:01.879
Delivering
payload in five,

18:01.913 --> 18:05.349
four, three, two, one.

18:08.786 --> 18:10.388
Delivery successful.

18:13.023 --> 18:13.858
Processing.

18:16.594 --> 18:20.865
Emergence in seven, six, five,

18:20.898 --> 18:24.568
- four, three, two, one.
- Come on, damnit, come on.

18:30.974 --> 18:33.577
Specimen
cohesion intact.

18:33.611 --> 18:36.548
Quantum incoherence nominal.

18:36.580 --> 18:39.016
Tachyon syncopation achieved.

18:45.789 --> 18:46.758
We did it.

19:07.511 --> 19:10.315
He checks out, everything.

19:14.986 --> 19:15.921
You really did it.

19:17.454 --> 19:18.289
We did it.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.192
All of us.

19:31.769 --> 19:33.305
- Oh.
- Yeah.

19:34.972 --> 19:36.907
They would be proud.

19:36.941 --> 19:37.875
Yeah.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.948
Yeah.

19:42.980 --> 19:45.349
Dr. Webb, Dr. Winrich,

19:45.383 --> 19:47.184
in honor of this
momentous occasion...

19:47.218 --> 19:48.620
Success!

19:51.588 --> 19:53.258
- Wow.
- That one's for you.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.159
How did you sneak
this in here, you two?

19:55.192 --> 19:56.961
I might have
hidden it in my lab coat.

19:56.994 --> 19:58.195
A toast,
what are we toasting?

19:58.229 --> 20:01.333
To Nobel Prizes
by the bucket loads.

20:01.365 --> 20:02.933
- Nobel Prizes!
- Cheers.

20:05.970 --> 20:06.805
To Nathan.

20:08.506 --> 20:09.173
And to Nathan.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.442
- To Nathan.
- To Nathan.

20:11.576 --> 20:13.979
And to Edward, the
time-traveling mouse.

20:15.346 --> 20:17.015
And to Edward, to Edward.

20:17.048 --> 20:17.949
To Edward.

20:17.981 --> 20:19.416
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.317
Yeah, no.

20:20.351 --> 20:21.586
I think
you're a little young.

20:21.618 --> 20:22.586
He is too young.

20:22.619 --> 20:24.822
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Come on, drink it!

20:34.164 --> 20:36.032
Look at you,
you're already wasted.

20:36.034 --> 20:36.835
See that?

20:36.867 --> 20:38.769
You're a sloppy drunk.

20:38.803 --> 20:40.238
What
are we gonna say?

20:40.270 --> 20:42.007
We are gonna
get in trouble, you guys.

20:42.039 --> 20:43.240
We'll tell
them it's a celebration.

20:43.273 --> 20:44.742
- Excuse me.
- I don't know, I don't know.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.379
Can't believe this
little guy, what a journey!

20:47.412 --> 20:48.846
Edward,
Edward's my hero!

20:48.880 --> 20:50.882
Aw, he's sleeping!

22:20.304 --> 22:21.605
- Dr. Winrich!
- Dr. Winrich!

22:22.573 --> 22:23.807
Dr. Winrich!

22:23.840 --> 22:25.008
Tell us
about the discovery!

22:25.876 --> 22:26.911
Dr. Winrich, is it true?

22:26.943 --> 22:28.379
Is it true you sent
a living creature

22:28.413 --> 22:29.280
through the time portal?

22:29.314 --> 22:30.582
Dr. Winrich, will
you be the first man

22:30.615 --> 22:31.650
to travel through time?

22:31.682 --> 22:33.250
What does this mean for
the future of mankind?

22:34.451 --> 22:36.520
Excuse me, excuse
me, excuse me.

22:36.554 --> 22:37.989
Someone leaked it to the press.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.359
No comment, no comment!

22:42.393 --> 22:43.928
Over here, Dr. Winrich.

23:08.352 --> 23:09.821
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:09.854 --> 23:10.889
Are you ready, buddy?

23:10.922 --> 23:12.156
It is with great pleasure

23:12.190 --> 23:15.693
that I present to
you the Quantum 42.

23:21.265 --> 23:24.469
The world's first temporal
manipulation portal.

23:24.501 --> 23:25.903
Are we having fun yet?

23:27.238 --> 23:28.440
I could get used to this.

23:30.307 --> 23:32.176
And now,
if you would all take

23:32.210 --> 23:34.546
your positions, we can
begin the demonstration.

23:50.428 --> 23:52.831
Portal
activation sequence initiated.

23:54.030 --> 23:55.366
Actuating reactor cores.

23:57.468 --> 23:59.336
Spooling feedback generators.

24:06.510 --> 24:08.413
The portal is now active.

24:09.846 --> 24:12.783
The emergence timer
is set for 10 seconds,

24:12.817 --> 24:14.652
meaning that we will
be sending the object

24:14.684 --> 24:17.154
10 seconds into the future.

24:17.188 --> 24:20.592
Then, 10 seconds after
entering the event horizon,

24:20.625 --> 24:22.527
it will re-emerge
from the other side.

24:24.694 --> 24:27.999
It's worth noting that only
non-conductive materials

24:28.031 --> 24:31.401
can traverse the portal due to
the high energy requirements

24:31.434 --> 24:32.669
of maintaining the field.

24:32.702 --> 24:34.404
Any conductive metals
would cause the portal

24:34.438 --> 24:37.175
to lose stability and collapse.

24:38.342 --> 24:40.011
What would happen
to all of that energy

24:40.044 --> 24:42.781
if the portal did
collapse, theoretically?

24:45.415 --> 24:48.953
It would dissipate
exponentially,

24:50.153 --> 24:51.455
which is why we have
taken the precaution

24:51.489 --> 24:53.490
of sealing the event chamber.

24:53.523 --> 24:55.626
This state-of-the-art
blast-proof facility

24:55.660 --> 24:57.762
can withstand up
to 80 terajoules

24:57.795 --> 24:59.297
of thermonuclear pressure,

25:00.463 --> 25:02.767
the equivalent of
an atomic bomb.

25:02.799 --> 25:04.434
Atomic bomb?

25:04.468 --> 25:05.303
Good analogy.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.207
Pre-delivery
cycle complete.

25:09.240 --> 25:14.211
Delivering payload
in eight, seven, six,

25:14.244 --> 25:18.115
five, four, three, two, one.

25:22.420 --> 25:23.755
Delivery successful.

25:24.855 --> 25:27.491
Awaiting tachyon
syncopation telemetry.

25:29.226 --> 25:30.795
Processing.

25:30.827 --> 25:35.165
Emergence in seven, six, five,

25:35.199 --> 25:38.303
four, three, two, one.

25:39.670 --> 25:40.772
Moment of truth.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.077
Ladies and gentlemen, you
have just witnessed time travel.

26:25.449 --> 26:26.884
Here we go.

26:26.916 --> 26:29.586
Dr. Winrich, Larry Fincher,
"Science Journal America."

26:29.619 --> 26:30.988
Oh, hi, Larry.

26:31.021 --> 26:33.625
Your previous experiments
in temporal physics

26:33.657 --> 26:36.394
utilized much smaller
particle accelerators.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.797
What are you boys using
to power this monster?

26:42.732 --> 26:44.335
- Um...
- Well, Larry,

26:44.367 --> 26:46.370
you know, that's a
damn good question.

26:47.538 --> 26:49.574
Since I like damn
good questions,

26:49.606 --> 26:51.075
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

26:51.107 --> 26:52.275
Follow me.

26:56.881 --> 26:57.716
Poor Larry.

26:59.316 --> 27:00.919
Okay, game face.

27:01.852 --> 27:02.754
- Hi!
- Hi.

27:06.289 --> 27:11.296
Larry, welcome to
J Lab E99117 Alpha,

27:14.365 --> 27:16.299
also known as Big Bertha.

27:20.171 --> 27:21.939
Now, this is what you might call

27:21.971 --> 27:24.408
an atomic feedback generator.

27:24.442 --> 27:27.178
Basically, it's a
big-ass nuclear battery

27:27.211 --> 27:30.048
that can exponentially amplify
the atomic energy output

27:30.080 --> 27:32.549
generated by the atom smashers.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.519
Yeah, boys at NASA can't wait

27:34.551 --> 27:36.120
to get their hands on this one.

27:37.954 --> 27:41.591
And all the feedback here
is internal to the system,

27:41.625 --> 27:43.193
and all the
load-bearing circuitry

27:43.227 --> 27:45.296
feeds directly into
the event chamber.

27:45.328 --> 27:49.466
So, in the case of any
unfortunate accident,

27:49.500 --> 27:52.036
the discharge would
be completely pacified

27:52.068 --> 27:55.039
by the gravimetric fields
generated by the portal.

28:00.310 --> 28:03.914
Well, sounds like you guys
have taken every precaution.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.318
So tell me, you don't think
there's any risk of, oh, say...

28:09.787 --> 28:12.957
ripping a permanent hole in
space-time with this thing?

28:12.990 --> 28:14.192
Because as I understand,

28:14.224 --> 28:16.159
that would be the
inevitable outcome

28:16.192 --> 28:19.129
if toying with Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle equations,

28:19.163 --> 28:20.397
which, as far as I can tell,

28:20.431 --> 28:21.966
is exactly what you
guys are doing here.

28:21.999 --> 28:24.169
Larry, Larry, Larry, Larry.

28:25.336 --> 28:28.205
As much
power as it takes

28:28.239 --> 28:31.076
to create a sustained
temporary rift,

28:32.242 --> 28:35.612
it's nothing compared
to what is required

28:35.645 --> 28:39.282
to produce a permanent
self-sustaining black hole

28:39.316 --> 28:41.452
in our universe, Lare.

28:42.353 --> 28:43.188
Come on.

28:44.020 --> 28:44.855
Trust me.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.763
We're safe as bugs in rugs.

29:02.472 --> 29:05.342
Now, Big Bertha's connected
solely to the event chamber.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.345
The rest of the lab
runs on city power.

29:08.679 --> 29:09.547
Yeah.

29:11.949 --> 29:12.850
Is that really them?

29:12.883 --> 29:13.918
Them they are, Lare,

29:15.051 --> 29:16.286
the very first objects

29:16.319 --> 29:17.855
ever successfully sent
through the portal

29:17.887 --> 29:20.191
four years ago at
this very university.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.193
Yeah.

29:24.561 --> 29:26.463
You know, any time anyone
accuses me of losing my marbles,

29:26.497 --> 29:28.199
I make sure I bring 'em in here.

29:31.234 --> 29:33.904
Let's go check out those
sweet robot arms, eh?

29:41.945 --> 29:43.613
- We're very grateful.
- Yeah, thank you.

29:43.646 --> 29:47.484
You guys have been
just, just amazing.

29:47.518 --> 29:50.387
It's so important
to have credible

29:50.421 --> 29:52.722
science journalism these
days.

29:52.756 --> 29:56.961
Your piece on the Higgs
was almost prophetic.

29:56.993 --> 29:59.730
We really can't
thank you enough.

30:27.156 --> 30:27.958
Ghost?

30:29.359 --> 30:30.160
Uh...

30:33.297 --> 30:34.198
Huh?

30:34.230 --> 30:36.334
You look like you've seen one.

30:36.366 --> 30:39.903
No, I'm just tired, I guess.

30:39.936 --> 30:42.105
Okay, well, this
probably isn't helping.

30:43.007 --> 30:44.275
Yeah.

30:44.307 --> 30:46.344
We can get out of
here if you want,

30:46.376 --> 30:47.979
go get a piece of pie somewhere.

30:49.246 --> 30:50.315
Nate'll cover for us.

30:51.848 --> 30:56.419
It's all happening, the
way Bill said it would.

30:56.452 --> 30:59.257
It's almost like
he knew, you know?

30:59.289 --> 31:01.591
Well, he was right about you.

31:01.625 --> 31:04.828
You're going to change
the world, Ryan Winrich.

31:04.862 --> 31:06.197
I have a feeling about you.

31:08.164 --> 31:09.399
What kind of feeling?

31:10.733 --> 31:13.603
Hey, there you are,
my two favorite people

31:13.636 --> 31:14.905
in time and space!

31:14.939 --> 31:18.209
Did you miss me as much
as I missed me?

31:18.241 --> 31:22.546
Well, it's highly
improbable.

31:22.578 --> 31:24.147
So, now for the big question,

31:25.615 --> 31:28.118
how long till you guys send
a person through this thing?

31:28.152 --> 31:30.221
Well, Larry,

31:30.253 --> 31:32.122
we could tell you
that information,

31:32.155 --> 31:34.057
but then we would
have to kill you,

31:35.259 --> 31:36.993
and I don't wanna
kill you, Larry.

31:37.027 --> 31:40.597
I like you, but I will let
you in on one more secret

31:40.631 --> 31:42.967
we have here at the lab.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.032
Here, come on.

31:48.739 --> 31:50.074
No fillings.

31:52.241 --> 31:54.545
Just sayin'.

31:54.577 --> 31:56.881
All right, one more thing.

31:58.082 --> 32:00.451
How does it feel to be
the top names in science

32:00.483 --> 32:01.952
since Albert Einstein?

32:03.586 --> 32:07.525
Um, well, actually,
Einstein once said

32:07.557 --> 32:09.393
that it's strange
to be so well-known,

32:09.425 --> 32:12.230
and yet, still be so lonely.

32:15.065 --> 32:19.570
Yeah, well,
Dr. Nathan Beaumont once said,

32:20.738 --> 32:21.839
"Fuck Einstein."

32:23.007 --> 32:25.810
Yeah, and hold on to
the hair plugs, Lare,

32:27.010 --> 32:29.046
'cause you ain't
seen nothin' yet.

34:08.878 --> 34:11.248
Yeah, you
better drink that down.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.382
How's your head?

34:12.416 --> 34:14.085
I stole his
sunglasses as punishment

34:14.117 --> 34:16.820
for his bad attempt
at karaoke last night.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.155
Revenge is a cruel bitch.

34:19.188 --> 34:20.257
I think you mean fate.

34:20.289 --> 34:22.992
Yeah, I think I do.

34:23.025 --> 34:25.962
Choose
faith! Choose faith!

34:28.965 --> 34:30.867
Never, ever again.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.538
So understand this.

34:34.704 --> 34:39.576
Man does not have
dominion over time.

34:41.545 --> 34:46.550
God has given man
dominion over the Earth...

34:47.150 --> 34:48.618
That's right.

34:48.652 --> 34:52.523
But time transcends man's
stewardship of this world.

34:53.657 --> 34:57.929
Science has finally gone
too far and encroached

34:59.295 --> 35:01.798
- where it does not not belong.
- Oh, encroached, well.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.135
Hold on, you guys,
that's Abner Rosen.

35:05.168 --> 35:06.569
Who?

35:06.603 --> 35:08.672
That is the bully from
Shadowbrook Elementary School.

35:08.704 --> 35:11.407
It's Abner Rosen, look!

35:13.744 --> 35:14.812
- Holy shit!
- Hear me,

35:14.844 --> 35:16.413
- brothers and sisters.
- Literally.

35:28.324 --> 35:29.559
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:30.760 --> 35:33.831
the disciples of Satan!

35:33.864 --> 35:34.798
We should go.

35:34.831 --> 35:36.333
- Yeah.
- Come on.

35:36.365 --> 35:37.867
- Repent, sinners!
- Repent!

35:37.900 --> 35:38.701
Repent!

35:38.735 --> 35:41.172
Repent, sinners!

35:41.204 --> 35:42.405
I got some repentance for you

35:42.438 --> 35:43.473
- right here, jackass!
- Nathan!

35:43.507 --> 35:44.642
Nate!

35:44.675 --> 35:47.111
- Good morning, hi!
- Nate, don't!

35:48.244 --> 35:50.181
Good morning, Dr. Nate
Beaumont, scientist.

35:51.681 --> 35:53.317
Okay, what have we here?

35:53.349 --> 35:54.851
Let me guess.

35:54.885 --> 35:57.888
Science comes from
the devil, am I right?

35:57.920 --> 35:58.755
Yeah.

35:58.789 --> 35:59.990
- Yeah.
- That's right.

36:00.023 --> 36:02.360
Yeah, evolution
is a lie, right?

36:03.559 --> 36:07.431
Jesus rode a dinosaur
and the Earth is flat.

36:07.463 --> 36:09.132
Is that about the gist
of the conversation

36:09.166 --> 36:10.635
that we're having here today?

36:12.936 --> 36:17.141
Science does come
from the devil, sir.

36:17.173 --> 36:18.009
Ah, see.

36:18.976 --> 36:20.443
And is meant to mislead us...

36:20.476 --> 36:22.378
Just let it go.

36:22.411 --> 36:24.514
- From our righteousness.
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

36:26.215 --> 36:31.221
If you weren't so blinded by
your smug, elitist arrogance,

36:32.856 --> 36:36.394
you would see just
how cleverly Satan

36:37.527 --> 36:39.797
has pulled the wool
over your eyes.

36:39.829 --> 36:42.632
- Okay, that's it.
- Hey.

36:42.666 --> 36:43.801
I've heard enough.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.034
Nate, come on.

36:45.068 --> 36:47.972
I'm gonna go ahead and forget

36:48.005 --> 36:50.541
my one ass kick
per customer rule,

36:50.574 --> 36:52.976
just today, just
for you, douchebag.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.044
Nate!

36:54.077 --> 36:55.312
- Huh?
- Come on!

36:55.344 --> 36:56.746
The cowardice of science.

36:58.414 --> 37:01.518
Do not tempt the
laws of providence!

37:01.550 --> 37:05.088
Use what time you have left
and beg for his forgiveness!

37:05.121 --> 37:07.924
Keep drinkin'
the Kool-Aid, Abby!

37:07.958 --> 37:12.963
Do not give in to the
shadow demons of your science.

37:19.168 --> 37:22.205
Failure,
protein breakdown detected.

37:22.239 --> 37:23.206
Dammit!

37:23.239 --> 37:26.276
Code 46682.

37:26.309 --> 37:28.645
Exit wave syncopation lost.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.548
Molecular cohesion lost.

37:31.414 --> 37:32.849
I don't get it.

37:33.849 --> 37:34.851
I just don't get it.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.789
The organic material should
retain stability now.

37:41.123 --> 37:42.592
Just doesn't make any sense.

37:42.626 --> 37:44.995
Take a break, bro. I'm
not the only one that had

37:45.027 --> 37:46.562
more than a few
drinks last night.

37:46.596 --> 37:48.097
Where is it breaking down?

37:48.130 --> 37:50.000
I don't know,

37:50.032 --> 37:52.435
somewhere in the
pulse resonance.

37:52.469 --> 37:56.472
Okay, every atom in the universe
resonates at a frequency

37:56.505 --> 37:58.675
specific to its time and place.

37:58.708 --> 37:59.942
When we put matter
through the portal,

37:59.976 --> 38:01.412
we're sending it out of
sync with the universe,

38:01.445 --> 38:03.380
and that doesn't affect
inorganic material.

38:03.413 --> 38:04.815
- Like the marbles.
- Exactly.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.583
But living tissue can't survive

38:06.615 --> 38:09.186
because of the strain of the
membranes on an atomic level.

38:10.519 --> 38:11.954
Okay, okay.

38:11.987 --> 38:13.856
So it's out of sync
with the flow of energy

38:13.889 --> 38:15.425
from the new timeline
when it re-enters.

38:15.458 --> 38:17.460
Exactly, but this equation
should correct for the change

38:17.494 --> 38:18.863
in electromagnetic force.

38:20.831 --> 38:22.298
So why isn't it working?

38:22.331 --> 38:26.302
We've been running the
same experiment for hours.

38:26.335 --> 38:28.038
It's
not the same experiment.

38:28.070 --> 38:29.940
Yeah, okay, well, virtually

38:32.608 --> 38:33.710
same experiment.

38:38.347 --> 38:39.782
I'm gonna switch
things up a little bit.

38:44.487 --> 38:47.223
Hey, Nate, I thought
we agreed not to liquefy

38:47.257 --> 38:49.592
any more mice until we'd
worked out the kinks.

38:51.594 --> 38:52.429
Bella.

38:53.797 --> 38:56.067
You two aren't the only
geniuses in the room, you know.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.501
Let's have a little faith.

38:58.534 --> 39:00.036
- Interesting.
- What?

39:00.070 --> 39:01.739
Instead of altering
the resonance on emergence...

39:01.771 --> 39:03.539
We alter it upon
entry into the portal.

39:03.572 --> 39:05.675
Then we can use exit
wave to re-adjust

39:05.708 --> 39:07.510
and correct for
any discrepancies.

39:07.543 --> 39:09.145
That's brilliant.

39:09.179 --> 39:10.447
Timer set at 10 seconds.

39:15.018 --> 39:18.521
Delivery in five, four,

39:18.554 --> 39:21.424
three, two, one.

39:24.527 --> 39:25.895
Delivery successful.

39:27.197 --> 39:28.465
Processing.

39:28.498 --> 39:29.465
It'll work.

39:32.536 --> 39:36.807
Emergence in
five, four, three, two, one.

39:42.112 --> 39:42.947
Yeah!

39:44.014 --> 39:45.315
Delivery
cycle complete.

39:45.347 --> 39:47.284
Way to go, Nate!

39:47.317 --> 39:49.519
Attention,
error detected.

39:50.619 --> 39:51.454
Oh, no.

39:52.722 --> 39:53.557
What?

39:58.128 --> 40:01.999
Warning.
Sample stability in extremis.

40:02.032 --> 40:05.536
Protein breakdown, quantum
coherence breakdown.

40:06.436 --> 40:07.838
Molecular cohesion failure.

40:08.704 --> 40:10.574
Unable to compensate.

40:10.606 --> 40:13.143
Dammit!

40:13.175 --> 40:14.444
We'll get there.

40:16.346 --> 40:18.681
We'll look at the
numbers again and

40:20.784 --> 40:22.519
maybe we'll find somethin'.

40:22.552 --> 40:23.987
Shit!

40:24.019 --> 40:25.456
Claudia, let's
get that under a microscope

40:25.489 --> 40:27.391
and see what we
can learn from it.

40:27.423 --> 40:28.391
Sorry, Geoff.

40:42.204 --> 40:43.973
Poor Geoffrey.

40:44.007 --> 40:45.375
Poor Geoffrey?

40:45.407 --> 40:46.909
Poor Bella.

40:46.943 --> 40:50.547
You guys know they call them
lab rats for a reason, right?

40:50.579 --> 40:51.414
Nice.

40:52.715 --> 40:53.983
All right then, a toast.

40:54.885 --> 40:56.620
To Bella,

40:56.652 --> 40:57.921
mouse of science.

40:59.322 --> 41:01.758
Long may she dine on the
giant cheese wheel in the sky.

41:01.791 --> 41:02.593
Nice.

41:04.226 --> 41:06.230
Aw, come on, guys!

41:07.697 --> 41:08.932
We're gettin' there, all right?

41:08.965 --> 41:12.135
Today was just another step,

41:12.168 --> 41:13.836
on the pathway to
eventual success.

41:13.869 --> 41:16.272
I think somebody needs
to lay off his euphemisms

41:16.306 --> 41:17.508
for a while.

41:17.541 --> 41:19.476
I think somebody's
got a pretty good hold

41:19.509 --> 41:22.880
on his euphemisms,
okay?

41:23.813 --> 41:25.682
You all right?

41:25.715 --> 41:27.351
I was just
thinkin' about Bill.

41:28.684 --> 41:32.154
I miss him, you know,
on days like today.

41:32.188 --> 41:33.023
We all do.

41:33.056 --> 41:33.891
Yeah.

41:35.324 --> 41:39.061
You know, I actually kinda
envy Bill a little bit...

41:39.094 --> 41:40.329
- Hey, hey, hey...
- You know?

41:40.362 --> 41:42.164
I think someone's
reached their limit.

41:42.197 --> 41:43.600
No, I'm serious, you guys.

41:44.967 --> 41:46.302
Bill finally figured out

41:47.704 --> 41:49.807
the answer to the
greatest mystery of all.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.775
What lies beyond.

41:56.579 --> 41:59.682
I guess we all figure that
one out sooner or later, huh?

42:07.157 --> 42:10.027
Hey, a toast.

42:10.059 --> 42:13.230
A toast to our friend and
our mentor, Bill Marshall.

42:14.396 --> 42:15.699
I think he'd be proud.

42:15.731 --> 42:16.666
To Bill.

42:16.699 --> 42:17.800
Bill.

42:17.833 --> 42:18.969
And on that note, gentlemen,

42:19.001 --> 42:21.103
I am going to take a
powder and hit the road.

42:21.137 --> 42:22.806
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no.

42:22.838 --> 42:24.206
We have an early
morning, I don't wanna...

42:24.239 --> 42:25.474
Wait, wait, you
haven't ordered dessert.

42:25.507 --> 42:26.442
- Dessert.
- Dessert!

42:26.476 --> 42:28.077
- Come on, come on.
- If there's one thing

42:28.110 --> 42:29.813
I've learned about
Dr. Caitlin Webb,

42:29.846 --> 42:32.081
in the 16 years
since I've known her,

42:32.114 --> 42:33.549
she never goes without dessert.

42:33.583 --> 42:34.751
This is true.

42:34.784 --> 42:36.420
- When she can order dessert.
- Mm-hmm.

42:36.452 --> 42:40.990
Unless there's an annoying
drunk idiot at the table, so...

42:41.023 --> 42:42.525
- Oh, Nate, come on!
- No, Nate!

42:42.559 --> 42:44.795
- Nate, come on!
- I will take my leave,

42:44.827 --> 42:46.862
- and I will hail a cab.
- Look, I'll take you home.

42:46.896 --> 42:49.333
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

42:49.365 --> 42:50.568
You kids have fun, okay?

42:51.867 --> 42:54.371
I'll see ya in the
morning, bright and early...

42:56.672 --> 42:58.308
ish, you know.

42:59.275 --> 43:01.378
Let me know what happens.

43:01.411 --> 43:03.947
You call me if you
need anything, all right?

43:03.980 --> 43:05.081
I will not call you.

43:10.420 --> 43:11.355
Good old Nate.

43:11.387 --> 43:12.690
Good old Nate.

43:33.076 --> 43:34.778
Miskatonic University, driver.

43:37.579 --> 43:38.949
Don't spare the whip.

43:45.355 --> 43:48.324
So...

43:48.358 --> 43:50.327
So?

43:52.494 --> 43:54.030
I got nothin'.

43:54.063 --> 43:56.132
You know what's funny

43:56.166 --> 43:58.735
is I don't actually
think I can remember

43:58.768 --> 44:00.836
the last time we
were alone together.

44:00.869 --> 44:04.474
That'd be November 4th, 2004.

44:05.742 --> 44:07.244
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

44:07.277 --> 44:08.478
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

44:08.510 --> 44:09.945
It was election night,
and everybody went out

44:09.978 --> 44:12.181
to down their sorrows.

44:12.215 --> 44:14.284
And they left us
alone in the lab,

44:14.317 --> 44:16.652
minding some experiment
or something,

44:16.686 --> 44:20.624
and I remember sitting
there, watching you work,

44:20.657 --> 44:23.861
and you were so meticulous,

44:24.693 --> 44:25.962
so intense.

44:27.530 --> 44:28.932
And then when you
finally did notice me,

44:28.965 --> 44:31.468
I totally freaked and I dropped
the stack of test slides

44:31.501 --> 44:32.703
- all over the floor...
- Oh!

44:32.735 --> 44:34.704
- It shattered everywhere.
- You cut your finger on the...

44:34.737 --> 44:36.772
Yeah, right there,
still have the scar.

44:36.806 --> 44:38.340
Oh, my gosh.

45:04.900 --> 45:05.902
Dr. Beaumont?

45:08.403 --> 45:09.840
It's late.

45:09.873 --> 45:11.175
It is late!

45:12.141 --> 45:14.043
Very late, Geoffrey.

45:14.077 --> 45:16.313
It's very late in the hour.

45:26.789 --> 45:28.958
Hello, Dr. Beaumont.

45:28.992 --> 45:30.527
Terminal encryption active.

45:36.865 --> 45:40.871
Nate, is there anything
I can help you with or?

45:40.903 --> 45:41.739
Eh,

45:42.871 --> 45:44.039
afraid not, Doogie.

45:46.376 --> 45:47.644
Not tonight.

45:53.949 --> 45:56.819
Accelerator
activation sequence initiated.

45:58.721 --> 45:59.789
Oh, my God.

46:09.199 --> 46:10.534
You know, Ryan,

46:13.369 --> 46:15.105
this would change everything.

46:21.010 --> 46:23.147
You know, Bill once told me

46:24.581 --> 46:26.817
most people live life
between the moments,

46:28.217 --> 46:30.520
never really seeing what's
right in front of them

46:31.753 --> 46:33.356
until the moment is gone.

46:35.057 --> 46:37.226
He said, "Ryan,

46:38.161 --> 46:39.496
"it's easy to be afraid.

46:41.931 --> 46:45.202
"But if you can face
your fear in the moment,

46:47.836 --> 46:50.306
"everything else becomes clear."

47:06.088 --> 47:07.289
It's the lab.

47:07.322 --> 47:08.924
Oh.

47:08.958 --> 47:09.960
Yeah, this is Ryan.

47:09.992 --> 47:11.193
Dr. Winrich?

47:11.226 --> 47:12.995
We have a situation.

47:18.268 --> 47:19.668
He won't unlock the door
and it's not responding.

47:19.702 --> 47:21.705
It's frozen or locked, or...

47:21.737 --> 47:23.138
What's he doing?

47:23.172 --> 47:24.273
Access
denied, access denied,

47:24.306 --> 47:26.275
access denied, access denied.

47:26.309 --> 47:29.246
Warning! Biological
organism detected.

47:29.278 --> 47:33.682
I think it's high time for
human trials, boys and girls!

47:35.518 --> 47:38.322
Accelerator
activation sequence complete.

47:39.422 --> 47:42.559
Caution! Safety
protocols disengaged.

47:42.592 --> 47:44.927
Nathan, Nathan,
get out of there!

47:46.496 --> 47:47.664
Nathan!

47:47.697 --> 47:49.164
For God's sake,
what are you doing?

47:49.197 --> 47:51.367
Safety protocol
failure. Unable to override.

47:51.400 --> 47:52.668
He's overridden the
doors from the mainframe.

47:52.702 --> 47:53.670
I can't get it open.

47:53.702 --> 47:54.637
Hey, let me try.

47:55.771 --> 47:57.139
Hey!

47:57.172 --> 47:59.174
Hey, it's the lovebirds!

47:59.208 --> 48:02.945
Hey, listen, listen, I
made some adjustments

48:02.978 --> 48:04.713
to the signal resonator.

48:04.746 --> 48:08.518
It's good! Perfectly safe now.

48:09.885 --> 48:11.021
Communication
channel active.

48:11.054 --> 48:12.289
Nathan, just come outta there

48:12.322 --> 48:14.457
and we'll go over those
changes together, okay?

48:14.489 --> 48:16.025
We'll think this thing through.

48:16.059 --> 48:18.361
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no! I got this, brother!

48:18.393 --> 48:19.995
I solved it, okay?

48:20.028 --> 48:22.164
We're good, I figured this out!

48:22.197 --> 48:26.568
And to prove it to you, and
to show you how sure I am,

48:26.601 --> 48:30.940
I, Nathan Charles Beaumont, am
gonna step into the unknown,

48:30.974 --> 48:33.476
and become the world's

48:33.509 --> 48:35.144
first time traveler!

48:37.480 --> 48:38.715
I'm sorry, Cate.

48:39.782 --> 48:40.984
I beat you to it.

48:41.016 --> 48:42.551
Nate, sweetie,
look at me, okay?

48:42.585 --> 48:44.653
You had a lot to
drink tonight, okay,

48:44.686 --> 48:46.855
and we're not gonna do this
now, not like this, okay?

48:46.889 --> 48:48.057
It's not safe.

48:48.090 --> 48:49.625
Nate, please don't
do this, Nate!

48:49.659 --> 48:50.994
Ryan, do something!

48:55.731 --> 48:58.067
Terminal encryption active.
Access denied.

48:58.101 --> 48:58.902
Dammit!

49:05.807 --> 49:06.976
Ryan, come on!

49:24.827 --> 49:25.929
I'll see you soon.

49:30.666 --> 49:32.001
- Nathan!
- No!

49:38.840 --> 49:40.342
Delivery successful.

49:43.112 --> 49:46.916
Emergence in seven, six, five,

49:46.949 --> 49:50.387
four, three, two, one.

51:04.860 --> 51:06.695
And
that's all he said?

51:10.233 --> 51:12.335
That's all he said.

51:12.367 --> 51:15.505
Had he ever
exhibited any behavior

51:15.538 --> 51:19.708
that could be interpreted
as suicidal before this?

51:21.443 --> 51:22.978
No.

51:24.713 --> 51:26.449
Do you think
he purposely intended

51:26.481 --> 51:27.983
to end his life?

51:30.452 --> 51:32.922
I don't know, no.

51:36.791 --> 51:38.494
I don't know.

51:38.527 --> 51:41.463
Detective, we have
some information.

51:41.496 --> 51:42.298
Excuse me.

51:45.601 --> 51:47.503
What was he thinking?

51:48.971 --> 51:51.541
What were you thinking?

51:53.976 --> 51:55.345
That was the lab.

51:56.344 --> 51:58.147
The substance is human remains.

51:59.581 --> 52:02.018
The blood type appears to
match that of Dr. Beaumont's.

52:03.385 --> 52:04.487
I'm sorry.

52:06.422 --> 52:08.423
I think I have enough
here for tonight.

52:08.456 --> 52:10.826
We can get the rest
in the morning.

52:15.764 --> 52:18.400
Dr. Winrich, if I
may for a moment.

52:18.434 --> 52:19.269
Sure.

52:19.302 --> 52:20.103
Hang on, okay?

52:20.135 --> 52:21.036
Okay.

52:23.139 --> 52:24.307
Yeah?

52:25.708 --> 52:28.577
Just outta curiosity
and for the record,

52:28.610 --> 52:30.045
how old was Dr. Beaumont?

52:31.112 --> 52:33.250
He's 28.

52:34.182 --> 52:34.985
Why?

52:36.318 --> 52:38.654
The lab boys say the
cellular decay of the substance

52:38.688 --> 52:41.090
in that room was
over 75 years old.

52:42.257 --> 52:43.926
Any idea how that could be?

53:51.760 --> 53:55.965
Transferring feed
to the resonator now.

54:03.938 --> 54:07.542
All right, Caitlin, gently.

54:18.621 --> 54:19.956
That's it, you got it.

54:22.358 --> 54:23.493
Almost there.

54:24.860 --> 54:26.762
Power's as
steady as she's gonna be.

54:27.663 --> 54:30.565
Resonating at 22.5.

54:30.599 --> 54:32.235
The portal should be active.

54:33.635 --> 54:36.306
All right, Mr. Winrich,
it's in your hands now!

54:37.773 --> 54:41.544
Three, two, one.

55:01.463 --> 55:03.565
10 seconds exactly!

55:03.599 --> 55:05.068
Yes, yes!

55:05.101 --> 55:06.836
- Yes!
- Yes!

55:10.139 --> 55:11.274
You did it, buddy!

55:11.306 --> 55:12.641
- You did it, buddy!
- We did it!

55:12.675 --> 55:14.410
- We made a time machine!
- We did it!

55:15.878 --> 55:17.046
We put the marbles
through time!

55:19.014 --> 55:20.650
Yeah, we built a time machine!

55:20.682 --> 55:22.018
We built a time machine!

55:25.221 --> 55:26.989
They went to the future.

55:27.021 --> 55:30.025
Bill, Bill, we did it!

55:47.710 --> 55:49.211
Bill, what's wrong?

55:50.478 --> 55:51.480
What is it?

55:55.317 --> 55:56.519
No, Bill!

55:57.585 --> 55:58.954
Call 9-1-1.

55:58.987 --> 56:01.056
- What happened?
- Call 9-1-1 now!

56:02.090 --> 56:03.358
Go!

56:07.195 --> 56:07.996
Finish it.

56:11.500 --> 56:15.036
No, hang on, hang on.

56:15.070 --> 56:16.639
Please.

56:16.672 --> 56:17.974
Please!

56:18.007 --> 56:20.009
- Nathan.
- They're on their way.

56:20.041 --> 56:21.043
What do we do?

56:22.510 --> 56:25.213
It's gonna be
okay, it's gonna be okay.

56:25.246 --> 56:28.283
Shh. We got you.

56:28.317 --> 56:29.786
We got you.

56:32.387 --> 56:34.356
Dr.
Channard. The new arrival is

56:34.389 --> 56:36.558
awake and appears
very distressed.

56:39.527 --> 56:41.029
I just keep thinking

56:43.164 --> 56:44.666
how much I owe him.

56:48.269 --> 56:49.838
I mean, I don't
even know who I'd be

56:49.871 --> 56:50.973
if it weren't for him.

56:52.106 --> 56:54.277
It's gonna be all
right, you guys.

56:56.878 --> 56:58.882
Do you remember the
first time we met?

57:02.016 --> 57:06.955
A bunch of nerdy misfit kids,
and he brought us together.

57:08.891 --> 57:11.059
God, it seems like yesterday.

57:12.561 --> 57:14.831
It's 13 years ago.

57:18.634 --> 57:19.735
13 good years.

57:19.768 --> 57:20.603
Yeah.

57:27.041 --> 57:28.043
I'm sorry.

57:29.478 --> 57:30.813
It was his heart.

57:33.748 --> 57:34.951
I'm very sorry.

58:19.128 --> 58:20.263
Ryan!

58:20.295 --> 58:22.764
What is it, what's the matter?

58:22.797 --> 58:23.632
Nothing.

58:24.599 --> 58:25.967
Everything's okay, Mom.

58:26.001 --> 58:28.137
Are you sure?

58:28.170 --> 58:30.139
Yeah, just go back to sleep.

58:30.172 --> 58:33.275
Okay.

58:33.309 --> 58:34.143
Okay.

01:00:52.213 --> 01:00:54.951
Bill was a rare individual.

01:00:57.686 --> 01:00:58.621
He was a teacher,

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:01.356
a mentor,

01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:04.027
and a good friend.

01:01:07.362 --> 01:01:09.597
He was the kinda person that
made you want to be more

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.099
than you thought you could be.

01:01:13.534 --> 01:01:15.437
And if you were lucky
enough to listen

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:19.608
when he spoke about the wonders
of this universe around us,

01:01:22.277 --> 01:01:24.414
your entire perspective on life,

01:01:25.614 --> 01:01:29.818
on everything, would
be forever changed.

01:01:37.159 --> 01:01:38.561
I never knew my real father.

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.035
But I'd like to think,

01:01:48.836 --> 01:01:50.505
I'd like to think that Bill knew

01:01:50.539 --> 01:01:53.309
that I always wished
that it coulda been him.

01:02:00.648 --> 01:02:02.117
He made me what I am today,

01:02:05.019 --> 01:02:06.822
and I will always
thank him for that.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.863
As from the heavens we came,

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.766
so to the heavens do we return.

01:02:16.798 --> 01:02:20.402
From ashes to ashes,
from dust to dust.

01:02:46.795 --> 01:02:50.298
I think Dad would
have really liked Bill.

01:02:52.434 --> 01:02:56.672
Wherever he is, I'm sure
Dad's very proud, Ryan,

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:02.878
of all you've been able to do.

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:07.048
Come on.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.318
Dean Foster's looking
for you at the house.

01:03:14.389 --> 01:03:15.591
Hey, you all right, bro?

01:03:15.623 --> 01:03:16.391
No, no.

01:03:17.391 --> 01:03:19.060
I need to talk to you, Ryan.

01:03:19.094 --> 01:03:20.396
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.197
I have to talk to
the dean real quick.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.534
No, now, Ryan.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.768
I need to talk to you now, okay?

01:03:26.802 --> 01:03:28.403
Nathan
Charles Beaumont,

01:03:28.436 --> 01:03:30.371
that was a beautiful eulogy.

01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:32.007
Thanks.

01:03:32.039 --> 01:03:34.710
I remember when you
were in the eighth grade.

01:03:34.742 --> 01:03:36.945
You were terrified
of public speaking.

01:03:36.978 --> 01:03:39.881
There was a particular
humanities class...

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:55.998
- Caitlin.
- Hey.

01:03:58.099 --> 01:03:59.835
- Ryan.
- Dean Foster.

01:03:59.867 --> 01:04:01.503
Good of you to come.

01:04:01.536 --> 01:04:03.938
William was a
good friend, Ryan,

01:04:03.972 --> 01:04:07.843
and you kids, you meant everything to
him, you know that.

01:04:07.876 --> 01:04:10.580
Oh, he was the best.

01:04:12.813 --> 01:04:15.650
William was a rare breed.

01:04:15.684 --> 01:04:18.086
He taught school not
because he had to,

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:19.554
but because he loved it.

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:22.024
And when he talked
about you three,

01:04:22.056 --> 01:04:24.759
you should have seen
the gleam in his eye.

01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:28.364
It's a rare thing of joy,
that sense of accomplishment

01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:30.865
a professor gets when he
realizes that one of his students

01:04:30.898 --> 01:04:33.434
has truly surpassed him.

01:04:33.467 --> 01:04:36.038
And with you three, well,

01:04:37.505 --> 01:04:39.774
I know for a fact that he
thought of you as family.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:47.016
What you may not know is that
Bill had a sizable savings.

01:04:48.951 --> 01:04:52.954
Old money. But he didn't
touch a cent of it.

01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:55.823
He was setting it aside
for your research,

01:04:55.856 --> 01:04:58.126
and he left specific
instructions.

01:04:59.827 --> 01:05:04.666
It's true, isn't it,
about your recent success?

01:05:06.335 --> 01:05:07.168
Yes.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.173
Then with your blessing,

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:13.442
we're going to
write a new chapter

01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:16.311
in the history of
Miskatonic University,

01:05:16.344 --> 01:05:17.779
starting with the construction

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.849
of the William Marshall
School of Temporal Sciences,

01:05:20.882 --> 01:05:24.853
a new wing devoted to
your groundbreaking work,

01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:26.655
and Bill's enduring legacy.

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:28.891
I don't know what to say.

01:05:31.592 --> 01:05:33.161
Thank you.

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.195
Say Einstein!

01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:42.231
Explain it again, Bill.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:45.166
Yeah, why does the
current seem to jump up

01:06:45.199 --> 01:06:47.468
when it reaches the
end of the line?

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:49.971
Well, we know that
when the spark fires,

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:52.508
it ionizes the air
around it, right?

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:54.843
And we know that
heated air rises,

01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:57.278
which is what the spark follows
as it moves up the line.

01:06:57.311 --> 01:07:01.382
So it follows the
ionized trail past the top

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:03.184
until it's dissipated
to the point

01:07:03.217 --> 01:07:05.253
that it can't
maintain the spark.

01:07:05.286 --> 01:07:07.989
Yes, good, good, Ryan.

01:07:08.023 --> 01:07:09.557
Check out the arc
light over there.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.293
It operates on the
same principal.

01:07:12.893 --> 01:07:14.162
I'll be at my desk.

01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:29.177
Hey, Ryan.

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.815
I finished all the
books you gave me.

01:07:32.847 --> 01:07:33.916
All of 'em?

01:07:34.782 --> 01:07:35.784
What else you got?

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.088
Why!

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.090
What else, huh?

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:41.956
Hmm.

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:49.064
Yes, yes, yes.

01:07:49.097 --> 01:07:51.567
I think I have just the thing.

01:07:55.769 --> 01:07:59.273
Some books are
very special, Ryan.

01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:05.447
Some books can change your life.

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.121
You think you're ready for it?

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:25.767
I was about your age
when I first read Wells.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.904
Opened my eyes to a whole
new world of possibilities.

01:08:30.238 --> 01:08:31.707
I look forward to
hearing your thoughts

01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:33.908
on that book, Mr. Winrich.

01:08:33.942 --> 01:08:37.011
Thanks, Bill.

01:08:37.045 --> 01:08:37.880
Thanks.

01:08:39.046 --> 01:08:39.881
You're welcome.

01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:54.863
Ryan, wait up!

01:08:54.895 --> 01:08:55.729
Oh, hey.

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:59.201
You know, Ryan,
there's more to life

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:01.537
than just books and
science projects.

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.470
Uh-huh, such as?

01:09:03.505 --> 01:09:05.974
Uh, such as a
certain total hottie

01:09:06.006 --> 01:09:09.609
that we both know who
never stops staring at you.

01:09:09.644 --> 01:09:12.548
Incoming hottie.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.481
Hey, what's up?

01:09:13.515 --> 01:09:15.716
We were just talkin' about you.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:17.319
What about me?

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:18.886
Nothin', nothin' at all.

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.421
And how are you today?

01:09:20.453 --> 01:09:22.490
Aced the geometry
quiz, I'm bettin'.

01:09:22.524 --> 01:09:23.359
Hi, Ryan.

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:25.292
Hi.

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:29.264
Oh, yeah, totally ignore
this prime specimen of manhood

01:09:29.296 --> 01:09:31.165
and focus on the nerd.

01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:32.533
I see how it is.

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:36.904
So I was talkin' to Howard
Phillips at lunch today,

01:09:36.938 --> 01:09:39.506
and apparently, his little
sister got so mad at him

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:42.644
for trading in her Barbie
video game, she put dog shit

01:09:42.676 --> 01:09:44.412
- in his lunchbox.
- Ew.

01:09:44.444 --> 01:09:45.680
That is gross!

01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:48.182
No, she actually put
it inside his Twinkie!

01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:49.350
Can you believe that?

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:53.022
You know, it's
good to be an only child.

01:09:54.355 --> 01:09:56.958
Do you have any
brothers or sisters, Ryan?

01:09:56.992 --> 01:09:58.761
No, how 'bout you?

01:10:00.694 --> 01:10:03.130
Sometimes I wish I
had a little sister,

01:10:03.163 --> 01:10:06.167
someone to play
with or dress up,

01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:07.502
or have a birthd..., uh.

01:10:10.005 --> 01:10:11.073
What, what's wrong?

01:10:12.239 --> 01:10:13.574
I left something
back at school.

01:10:13.608 --> 01:10:15.077
I have to go back.

01:10:15.109 --> 01:10:16.777
We're halfway home, just
leave it till tomorrow!

01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:17.945
I can't, okay?

01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:19.780
Ryan, tell me
you'll wait for me.

01:10:19.814 --> 01:10:21.583
- We're not waiting.
- Tell me you'll wait.

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:22.818
Make him wait!

01:10:25.552 --> 01:10:26.721
Women.

01:10:53.715 --> 01:10:54.516
Hey.

01:10:55.783 --> 01:10:57.018
I thought only the
scum of the school

01:10:57.051 --> 01:10:58.786
had to stay after class.

01:11:01.088 --> 01:11:03.692
Wouldn't have pegged
Caity Webb for a bad girl.

01:11:03.725 --> 01:11:04.760
What do you want?

01:11:06.161 --> 01:11:09.998
Caity the bad girl
wants to know what I want.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:13.702
What do you got?

01:11:13.734 --> 01:11:15.103
Nothing!

01:11:15.136 --> 01:11:15.937
What's this?

01:11:15.970 --> 01:11:16.804
It's nothing!

01:11:16.837 --> 01:11:18.139
If it's nothing
you won't miss it.

01:11:18.172 --> 01:11:18.806
Give it!

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.042
What's going on?

01:11:20.074 --> 01:11:23.045
Hey, hey, it's
my favorite dork!

01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:25.680
Are you okay?

01:11:26.847 --> 01:11:28.149
What do you care, dork?

01:11:28.182 --> 01:11:30.452
She's not your girlfriend, dork.

01:11:30.484 --> 01:11:31.686
Whatcha readin', dork?

01:11:34.823 --> 01:11:36.191
Stop it!

01:11:36.224 --> 01:11:37.592
What is going on in here?

01:11:41.296 --> 01:11:42.197
Miss Webb?

01:11:43.597 --> 01:11:45.466
Abner took my box.

01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:49.505
Mr. Rosen, back
to detention now!

01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:00.748
You two, head home.

01:12:07.654 --> 01:12:08.556
What a jerk.

01:12:10.257 --> 01:12:11.225
It's not that bad.

01:12:14.595 --> 01:12:15.663
Here.

01:12:15.697 --> 01:12:16.931
It's for you.

01:12:22.337 --> 01:12:24.773
Bill told me it was
your birthday today.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.009
Yeah, I wasn't really
gonna tell anyone.

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:30.813
I'm not that big of
a birthday person.

01:12:32.514 --> 01:12:33.315
Open it.

01:12:52.233 --> 01:12:54.470
You seem sad a lot.

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:57.972
Maybe this will help
you forget the bad times

01:12:58.006 --> 01:13:00.476
and remember the good ones.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:03.177
It's cool.

01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:12.119
A-hem, what the hell
is this, the Love Boat?

01:13:12.153 --> 01:13:14.722
I've been waitin' down at
the corner like a schmuck!

01:13:15.923 --> 01:13:18.627
Come on, let's go, it's
gonna be dark soon.

01:13:18.659 --> 01:13:19.494
Jesus!

01:13:21.496 --> 01:13:24.399
I wanna hear all about
this later, okay, Romeo?

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:28.964
Where's Nate?

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.765
I don't know.

01:14:30.797 --> 01:14:31.765
He'll catch up.

01:14:38.038 --> 01:14:38.873
So.

01:14:39.806 --> 01:14:40.641
So.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:44.746
Do you want me to
carry your backpack

01:14:44.779 --> 01:14:46.314
for you, or anything?

01:14:46.346 --> 01:14:48.317
No, I got it.

01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:51.353
Okay.

01:14:52.819 --> 01:14:54.121
Okay.

01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:03.565
It's quiet without Nate.

01:15:05.466 --> 01:15:08.070
Yeah, it's different.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:12.073
Yeah, it's kinda nice though.

01:15:12.105 --> 01:15:13.641
Yeah.

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:14.510
Yeah.

01:15:33.694 --> 01:15:36.331
How 'bout we go
through the park today?

01:15:36.363 --> 01:15:38.232
Yeah, sounds good to me.

01:15:47.641 --> 01:15:48.609
I got an idea.

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:51.012
Let's race!

01:15:51.045 --> 01:15:51.913
What?

01:15:53.814 --> 01:15:54.615
Hey!

01:15:58.752 --> 01:16:00.121
Come on, this way!

01:16:11.599 --> 01:16:12.534
Let me go!

01:16:12.567 --> 01:16:13.368
Yeah, man!

01:16:14.868 --> 01:16:17.005
Ryan!

01:16:17.037 --> 01:16:18.306
Let go of me!

01:16:20.274 --> 01:16:21.476
Stay there.

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.452
I still want my present, Caity.

01:16:30.484 --> 01:16:32.219
You got a present
for me, bad girl?

01:16:33.154 --> 01:16:34.756
'Cause I got a present for you.

01:16:44.998 --> 01:16:46.300
How 'bout you give me my present

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.470
when I'm done with
your dork boyfriend?

01:16:48.502 --> 01:16:49.337
How's that?

01:16:51.738 --> 01:16:53.173
Get him up.

01:16:58.179 --> 01:17:00.481
Come on, hit me,
come on, hit me!

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.716
- Hit me!
- Kill him!

01:17:01.748 --> 01:17:03.150
- Abner, hit him!
- Come on, man!

01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:04.418
Come on! Hit me, pussy!

01:17:04.452 --> 01:17:06.054
- Kick his ass!
- Come on, man!

01:17:06.087 --> 01:17:07.422
Stop!

01:17:07.454 --> 01:17:08.657
Ryan!

01:17:11.024 --> 01:17:12.594
Stop!

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:13.561
Hey, asshole!

01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:20.869
I got this.

01:17:24.572 --> 01:17:25.407
Come on.

01:17:36.617 --> 01:17:37.519
You all right?

01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:38.619
Yeah.

01:17:39.987 --> 01:17:40.822
Thanks.

01:18:07.648 --> 01:18:08.717
Are you okay?

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:10.985
Yeah.

01:18:38.546 --> 01:18:39.815
I'm gonna get you.

01:18:41.748 --> 01:18:42.884
One day.

01:18:44.085 --> 01:18:45.353
Your friends won't
always be there!

01:18:45.386 --> 01:18:46.855
Oh, I'll be there.

01:18:56.063 --> 01:18:57.998
This was fun.

01:18:58.032 --> 01:18:59.367
We should do it again some time.

01:18:59.399 --> 01:19:01.536
You're crazy.

01:19:17.819 --> 01:19:19.921
Well, this is me.

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:20.988
Thanks for walkin' me home.

01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:23.224
Are you gonna be okay?

01:19:23.256 --> 01:19:24.858
Yeah.

01:19:24.891 --> 01:19:26.528
I'm gonna go scrub my
face with engine cleaner

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:29.496
to make sure I get all his
disgustingness off of me.

01:19:29.529 --> 01:19:31.565
Don't forget about Bill's
surprise party on Sunday!

01:19:31.599 --> 01:19:33.034
All right, see ya!

01:19:33.067 --> 01:19:33.835
See ya!

01:19:33.868 --> 01:19:34.703
Bye.

01:19:36.871 --> 01:19:39.740
Well, thanks.

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:40.875
- For what?
- For what?

01:19:40.908 --> 01:19:43.878
I don't know, saving my life?

01:19:43.911 --> 01:19:45.413
Abner Rosen's a douchebag.

01:19:45.445 --> 01:19:47.414
Someone needed to
stick it to him.

01:19:47.448 --> 01:19:48.884
Well, I owe you one.

01:19:49.484 --> 01:19:51.252
Well, in that case,
you could hook me up

01:19:51.284 --> 01:19:52.921
with one of Caitlin's
hot friends.

01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:54.755
I'm seriously dyin' over here.

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:58.292
She likes you, you know?

01:19:58.326 --> 01:19:59.728
I can sense these things.

01:20:00.728 --> 01:20:01.863
We're just friends.

01:20:04.297 --> 01:20:05.567
Okay, okay.

01:20:09.002 --> 01:20:11.305
So you think Bill
suspects anything?

01:20:11.338 --> 01:20:13.341
I don't know, I guess
we'll find out on Sunday.

01:20:13.373 --> 01:20:14.908
Guess we will.

01:20:32.827 --> 01:20:34.796
- Surprise!
- Oh, my!

01:20:34.828 --> 01:20:36.296
Happy birthday, Bill!

01:20:36.329 --> 01:20:38.565
What a nice surprise!

01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:39.833
Thank you.

01:20:39.867 --> 01:20:41.569
Sit down, sit down, we
have a present for you.

01:20:41.601 --> 01:20:42.970
Okay, what is this?

01:20:43.003 --> 01:20:44.838
- It's from all of us.
- Look at this!

01:20:44.872 --> 01:20:46.074
We all built it...

01:20:46.106 --> 01:20:47.542
But it
was Ryan's idea.

01:20:47.574 --> 01:20:50.778
Oh, it's
beautiful.

01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:51.979
Classic.

01:20:56.317 --> 01:20:57.819
That's just some notes I took

01:20:57.851 --> 01:20:59.186
on those books you gave me.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.656
You know, so maybe we
could build a time machine

01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:05.692
of our own some day, a real one.

01:21:13.567 --> 01:21:14.970
This is fantastic.

01:21:16.503 --> 01:21:18.006
Thank you!

01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:19.240
Thank you so much.

01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:24.811
You are the most talented
and gifted students

01:21:24.845 --> 01:21:27.048
I've ever had. I mean
that, and I thank you.

01:21:27.081 --> 01:21:28.783
This is wonderful, a
wonderful surprise.

01:21:28.815 --> 01:21:30.585
- Happy birthday!
- Birthday!

01:21:31.252 --> 01:21:32.687
You gotta
make a wish now.

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.189
- Make a wish.
- Okay, okay.

01:21:35.221 --> 01:21:37.391
Mm, what's my wish?

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.862
Gail: All right!

01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:42.931
Very good!

01:21:42.963 --> 01:21:44.332
You gotta tell
us your wish now.

01:21:44.364 --> 01:21:45.399
Tell us your wish!

01:21:45.432 --> 01:21:47.034
- Tell us your wish!
- Tell us your wish, tell us...

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.436
No, no, you don't
wanna know my wish.

01:21:48.469 --> 01:21:49.671
- You gotta tell us.
- Please!

01:21:49.703 --> 01:21:51.372
I can't, it won't come
true. Okay, okay, all right.

01:21:52.439 --> 01:21:53.807
My wish,

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:58.512
my hope is that the three
of you stay together.

01:22:01.148 --> 01:22:02.150
You're a great team,

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:05.920
and together, you can
accomplish anything.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:10.891
So let's have some cake.

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:12.694
- Yeah, let's have some cake.
- Let's have cake!

01:22:12.726 --> 01:22:14.362
- Let's eat some cake.
- Thank you!

01:22:14.395 --> 01:22:15.997
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Happy birthday.

01:22:16.029 --> 01:22:17.398

it's okay if you wanna
watch these old videos.

01:24:03.237 --> 01:24:04.139
I don't mind.

01:24:05.773 --> 01:24:08.342
And if you wanna talk about it,

01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:10.478
we can talk about
anything you want.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.582
I, uh,

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:17.252
I miss Dad.

01:24:20.287 --> 01:24:21.556
You miss Dad?

01:24:23.623 --> 01:24:27.194
Yeah, I wish he
was still here.

01:24:29.662 --> 01:24:31.098
I miss him too, Ryan.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:33.634
And you know that
wherever he is,

01:24:36.036 --> 01:24:38.006
he's always watchin' out for us.

01:24:39.472 --> 01:24:42.676
And I'm sure that he wouldn't
let anything bad happen to us,

01:24:44.244 --> 01:24:46.480

him in our hearts.

01:24:54.387 --> 01:24:56.157

It's okay.

01:24:58.525 --> 01:25:00.127
But I like to drive you.

01:25:03.396 --> 01:25:05.132
You can't always
protect me, Mom.

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:06.935
You just can't.

01:25:14.975 --> 01:25:16.477
You remember last week,
we talked about the problem

01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:18.646
of Achilles and the tortoise.

01:25:19.979 --> 01:25:23.517
This was a problem that
arose around 450 B.C.,

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:27.121
with the Greek
philosopher Zeno of Elea.

01:25:27.154 --> 01:25:30.558
Zeno developed these
thought experiments

01:25:30.591 --> 01:25:32.894
as a way to show the
inherent problems

01:25:32.926 --> 01:25:35.362
of Pythagorean philosophy.

01:25:35.395 --> 01:25:36.963
So who can tell
me, what do we call

01:25:36.997 --> 01:25:38.633
these types of logic problems?

01:25:40.667 --> 01:25:41.668
Ryan Winrich.

01:25:43.103 --> 01:25:43.938
Um.

01:25:45.305 --> 01:25:46.706
What was the question?

01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:48.275
Dork!

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:52.613
I can see someone has his
head in the clouds this morning.

01:25:52.645 --> 01:25:54.248
No, I was just, uh.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.688
What a dork!

01:26:02.622 --> 01:26:04.192
Here, go to the nurse.

01:26:13.367 --> 01:26:14.202
Okay.

01:26:50.837 --> 01:26:53.173
Hey, Mom, did you open my...?

01:26:54.341 --> 01:26:57.144
Ryan, you remember Dr.
Matheson from church.

01:27:04.717 --> 01:27:08.521
So
how's school, Ryan?

01:27:08.555 --> 01:27:10.191
It's fine.

01:27:14.895 --> 01:27:16.331
Got a cut on your lip.

01:27:17.698 --> 01:27:19.634
Is there some trouble
you wanna tell me about?

01:27:23.503 --> 01:27:24.338
Not really.

01:27:26.372 --> 01:27:27.942
Okay.

01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:29.110
I see.

01:27:37.551 --> 01:27:42.123
Do you know why your mom
asked me to talk to you today?

01:27:44.557 --> 01:27:46.360
Well, she's concerned about you.

01:27:48.261 --> 01:27:50.096
She feels like you don't
communicate with her

01:27:50.130 --> 01:27:51.132
the way you used to,

01:27:53.367 --> 01:27:54.534
before the accident.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.409
Got somethin' I'd like
to show you, if I could.

01:28:15.722 --> 01:28:16.923
Seen that picture before?

01:28:18.992 --> 01:28:20.061
It's my picture.

01:28:23.096 --> 01:28:25.432
How do you feel when
you look at that picture?

01:28:30.237 --> 01:28:31.672
I miss him.

01:28:31.704 --> 01:28:34.108
Who? Who do you miss?

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:38.145
My dad.

01:28:41.314 --> 01:28:42.817
Is he the only one you miss?

01:28:45.152 --> 01:28:46.052
What do you mean?

01:28:46.086 --> 01:28:47.555
In that photo.

01:28:52.158 --> 01:28:53.728
Yeah, I guess.

01:29:18.752 --> 01:29:20.688
Has there
been any word about the body?

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.391
Nothing. It
just disappeared,

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:27.528
and they can't explain it.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.596
These
things take time.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:33.167
The memories may come
back, they may not.

01:29:33.199 --> 01:29:36.871
It was an incredibly
traumatic event,

01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:39.640
and his mind is
young and fragile.

01:29:41.041 --> 01:29:44.110
He may subconsciously choose
to block it out forever.

01:29:44.144 --> 01:29:49.083
He doesn't
even remember his own...

01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:52.987
Now, try not to worry.
Just be strong, Gail.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:54.822
You and Ryan will be just fine.

01:29:58.926 --> 01:30:00.761
Get off!

01:30:00.793 --> 01:30:03.430
I asked you a question, dork!

01:30:03.463 --> 01:30:06.067
Do you bring or buy?

01:30:07.134 --> 01:30:07.969
Check it.

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:14.307
Nothin'.

01:30:14.341 --> 01:30:17.611
Perfect, I prefer cash.

01:30:17.644 --> 01:30:21.748
Get off!

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:24.051
- Nice!
- Yeah!

01:30:24.083 --> 01:30:25.618
Looks like we
got dork's lunches

01:30:25.652 --> 01:30:27.755
for the whole week right here.

01:30:30.056 --> 01:30:31.157
What's this?

01:30:35.061 --> 01:30:38.466
"Have a good day at
school today, Ryan.

01:30:38.498 --> 01:30:40.067
"Love, Mom."

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:42.269
- Aw!
- That's so cute.

01:30:42.301 --> 01:30:44.838
You havin' a
good day, shithead?

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:46.073
'Cause I know I am.

01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:52.947
Pleasure doin' business
with you, dumbass!

01:33:05.378 --> 01:33:08.414
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, easy, easy!

01:33:13.686 --> 01:33:15.088
They can't hurt you.

01:33:16.789 --> 01:33:17.591
Don't worry.

01:33:19.025 --> 01:33:20.193
You're safe now.

01:33:22.628 --> 01:33:23.463
Wha...?

01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:26.199
Is this the first
time you've seen 'em?

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:39.780
My name's Bill
Marshall. What's yours?

01:33:39.813 --> 01:33:40.648
Ryan.

01:33:42.048 --> 01:33:43.184
Ryan Winrich.

01:33:44.216 --> 01:33:45.585
Well, Ryan, um,

01:33:47.587 --> 01:33:49.557
I'm headed home, how 'bout you?

01:33:53.359 --> 01:33:56.029
Maybe we should walk together
just to be safe, huh?

01:34:05.838 --> 01:34:08.042
So what were
those things anyway?

01:34:09.141 --> 01:34:10.610
Well, they're kinda
hard to explain.

01:34:10.644 --> 01:34:12.680
There's a lot about
'em we don't know.

01:34:12.712 --> 01:34:15.615
Mostly, they're just observers,

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:17.851
watchers, you know?

01:34:18.685 --> 01:34:20.054
Lurkers, I call 'em.

01:34:21.253 --> 01:34:25.158
They're from a different
place, different space,

01:34:26.359 --> 01:34:29.764
and they check in on our
world from time to time.

01:34:30.831 --> 01:34:31.865
Like in "Flatland."

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.135
What?

01:34:35.068 --> 01:34:36.302
Good Lord!

01:34:38.171 --> 01:34:40.508
I didn't read Abbott till
I was in grad school.

01:34:41.707 --> 01:34:44.978
Yeah, my dad gave it
to me before he died.

01:34:48.948 --> 01:34:49.783
I see.

01:34:51.283 --> 01:34:55.755
But yeah, yeah,
like in "Flatland,"

01:34:55.788 --> 01:34:57.890
except they don't
interact directly.

01:34:57.923 --> 01:35:00.694
They just observe
the natural events

01:35:00.726 --> 01:35:02.496
in our time-space continuum.

01:35:04.965 --> 01:35:06.500
At least, that's what we think.

01:35:08.135 --> 01:35:09.670
Who's we?

01:35:09.703 --> 01:35:11.205
Those of us who can see them

01:35:13.073 --> 01:35:14.742
and want to understand them.

01:35:18.845 --> 01:35:22.048
You know, Ryan, I
learned the hard way

01:35:22.082 --> 01:35:23.817
that sometimes it's
best not to tell people

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:25.753
you can see something
that they can't.

01:35:27.287 --> 01:35:28.689
You know what I'm saying?

01:35:33.359 --> 01:35:36.463
I saw the item in
your pocket earlier,

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:39.632
and I know that we just met, but

01:35:41.067 --> 01:35:43.537
is there anything you
want to talk to me about?

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:48.909
I just... I almost
made a mistake.

01:35:50.543 --> 01:35:51.444
That's all.

01:35:55.047 --> 01:35:55.849
Good man.

01:36:05.559 --> 01:36:06.793
Ryan, where have you been?

01:36:06.827 --> 01:36:08.762
The school called, I
have been worried sick!

01:36:08.795 --> 01:36:11.097
Mrs. Winrich,
I'm Bill Marshall.

01:36:11.131 --> 01:36:13.100
I'm a professor at
Miskatonic University,

01:36:13.132 --> 01:36:15.502
and I'm a new friend
of your son's.

01:36:17.503 --> 01:36:18.905
He's had a pretty rough day.

01:36:21.173 --> 01:36:22.442
Are you okay?

01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.886
Go inside and get cleaned up.

01:36:35.255 --> 01:36:36.824
Thank you for your
help, Mr. Marshall.

01:36:36.856 --> 01:36:39.926
Mrs. Winrich, may I
have a word, please?

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.500
Forgive me if I'm out
of line by saying this,

01:36:46.533 --> 01:36:49.703
but you have a very gifted boy.

01:36:51.604 --> 01:36:54.774
I wonder if you realize
how gifted he is?

01:36:56.076 --> 01:36:58.145
He's also a very
troubled boy, Mr. Marshall.

01:36:58.177 --> 01:37:00.948
I know, I know,
believe me, I understand.

01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:02.815
I teach a class
at the university

01:37:02.849 --> 01:37:05.319
for exceptionally bright
and troubled kids,

01:37:05.351 --> 01:37:09.155
and I think Ryan
would be right at home

01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:11.557
with the boys and
girls in my class.

01:37:15.962 --> 01:37:19.566
I just want
what's best for him.

01:37:19.599 --> 01:37:21.268
That's all I want, Mr. Marshall.

01:37:22.868 --> 01:37:23.703
Please,

01:37:25.305 --> 01:37:26.140
call me Bill.

01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:50.364
Anyway, those are the questions
that I thought might work.

01:37:50.396 --> 01:37:51.597
Okay, well, you know,

01:37:51.631 --> 01:37:53.133
I think if you reduce
one or two of them,

01:37:53.166 --> 01:37:56.604
then yeah, this first one
looks a little difficult.

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:59.172
I'd simplify a little bit.

01:37:59.204 --> 01:38:01.240
Once simplified, they
should be able to do it,

01:38:01.274 --> 01:38:02.175
- no problem.
- Okay.

01:38:02.208 --> 01:38:03.510
- It shouldn't take any time.
- Thank you.

01:38:03.542 --> 01:38:04.877
- Okay, sure.
- I'll talk to you soon.

01:38:04.911 --> 01:38:06.145
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

01:38:06.179 --> 01:38:07.914
Hey, Ryan, good to see you, man.

01:38:07.948 --> 01:38:08.414
You ready?

01:38:08.448 --> 01:38:09.682
Come on in.

01:38:09.716 --> 01:38:11.619
Take a deep breath.
It's gonna be good.

01:38:16.355 --> 01:38:17.157
Come on!

01:38:27.167 --> 01:38:30.570
Nathan, Caitlin, this is Ryan.

01:38:30.603 --> 01:38:32.873
He's gonna be joining
us for a while.

01:38:32.905 --> 01:38:33.841
Nice to meet you.

01:38:35.542 --> 01:38:37.577
It's called the
Wimshurst machine.

01:38:37.609 --> 01:38:39.512
It's an electrostatic generator.

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:41.048
Is it dangerous?

01:38:41.081 --> 01:38:44.083
Don't touch the current,
but you can give it a try.

01:38:44.117 --> 01:38:47.487
Just turn that
crank right there.

01:38:51.957 --> 01:38:53.659
We were just about to
start a game before class.

01:38:53.693 --> 01:38:54.628
You wanna join us?

01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:55.529
Yeah, sure.

01:38:57.796 --> 01:38:59.632
So this game's
called Cathedral.

01:39:00.766 --> 01:39:02.435
This is the first piece
you start out with,

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:03.703
and you put all these
pieces around it.

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:05.271
You wanna get the most points.

01:39:05.305 --> 01:39:07.574
Each piece is worth 10 points.

01:39:07.606 --> 01:39:09.710
Person with the
most points wins.

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:10.577
I'll start.

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:15.015
Nice move!

01:39:16.783 --> 01:39:18.819
I'll go here.

01:39:45.645 --> 01:39:46.980
No fair!

01:39:47.012 --> 01:39:49.882
I didn't know you
could do that move!

01:39:49.916 --> 01:39:53.520
Okay, since you didn't know
about it, I'll take it back,

01:39:53.552 --> 01:39:56.722
but next time I do it,
it's gonna be fair, okay?

01:39:56.756 --> 01:39:59.326
Okay, thanks, Ryan!

01:39:59.359 --> 01:40:02.195
Okay, Ryan, I want your
sister in bed at nine.

01:40:02.228 --> 01:40:03.128
Okay.

01:40:03.162 --> 01:40:04.430
Emma, listen
to your big brother.

01:40:04.463 --> 01:40:06.265
- He's in charge, okay?
- Kay.

01:40:06.298 --> 01:40:08.068
Now, be
good, no wild parties.

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.668
I will, I won't.

01:40:09.702 --> 01:40:12.039
Oh, and please don't
eat a ton of junk food.

01:40:12.072 --> 01:40:13.739
I will know what's missing.

01:40:13.773 --> 01:40:15.307
- Okay.
- See you in the morning!

01:40:15.341 --> 01:40:18.311
- Good night, I love you, bye!
- Night, love you.

01:40:18.344 --> 01:40:19.179
Bye.

01:40:23.682 --> 01:40:24.951
Here he comes now.

01:40:24.984 --> 01:40:26.153
I'm getting out of here!

01:40:32.324 --> 01:40:34.394
No!

01:40:36.195 --> 01:40:37.530
Johnny!

01:40:37.564 --> 01:40:39.466
Help me, help!

01:40:56.949 --> 01:40:58.085
What happened?

01:40:58.118 --> 01:41:00.520
At the window -
someone's at the window!

01:41:00.552 --> 01:41:01.621
Are you sure?

01:41:01.654 --> 01:41:02.989
I saw him looking in.

01:41:17.203 --> 01:41:18.672
I'm scared.

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:25.212
Emma, go upstairs.

01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:35.454
Ryan, is that you?

01:41:35.488 --> 01:41:37.490
Don't answer it, Ryan!

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:39.460
Who is it?

01:41:43.462 --> 01:41:44.764
I said who is it?

01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.635
A friend.

01:41:50.603 --> 01:41:52.439
Pick up the phone
and dial 9-1-1.

01:42:01.247 --> 01:42:03.383
I'm not gonna
hurt you, all right?

01:42:03.416 --> 01:42:05.452
Just , just calm down!

01:42:05.484 --> 01:42:06.585
Just calm down, okay!

01:42:07.987 --> 01:42:10.724
No, no, Ryan!

01:42:10.756 --> 01:42:13.759
Ryan, listen to me,
this is important, okay?

01:42:13.792 --> 01:42:15.228
I have to talk to you, Ryan.

01:42:16.328 --> 01:42:18.430
I have to tell you
what's going to happen.

01:42:20.199 --> 01:42:22.935
Very soon, you're going
to invent something,

01:42:24.170 --> 01:42:25.372
an incredible machine

01:42:26.538 --> 01:42:28.341
that allows you to
travel through time.

01:42:29.841 --> 01:42:32.344
But you can't let it
happen, you understand?

01:42:32.377 --> 01:42:35.148
You can't make it,
that's what they want.

01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.415
That's how they get in.

01:42:37.716 --> 01:42:39.118
That's how it begins.

01:42:40.453 --> 01:42:41.522
They're not watchers.

01:42:43.222 --> 01:42:45.292
They want this
world for their own.

01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:49.530
I've seen what
those things can do.

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:52.932
They get into your subconscious.

01:42:54.199 --> 01:42:56.235
They manipulate everything!

01:42:56.269 --> 01:42:58.238
You have to fight them, Ryan!

01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:59.773
You have to resist!

01:43:19.458 --> 01:43:24.463
I don't
have any time!

01:43:25.597 --> 01:43:26.966
You gotta listen
to me, I'm jumping!

01:43:28.033 --> 01:43:29.902
I'm jumping like the marbles!

01:43:29.935 --> 01:43:32.304
I'm unstuck in time!

01:43:32.337 --> 01:43:35.108
I've been trying to
find you for 13 years!

01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:38.844
I've been trying to find you

01:43:40.345 --> 01:43:41.948
for 13 years.

01:43:46.586 --> 01:43:51.057
You have to remember what
I am saying to you, Ryan.

01:43:52.257 --> 01:43:55.328
You have to stop them!

01:44:06.905 --> 01:44:07.740
No.

01:44:16.349 --> 01:44:17.184
No, no.

01:44:18.551 --> 01:44:20.153
No, no, no, no, no.

01:44:21.887 --> 01:44:24.957
No, no, no, God, no!

01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:25.826
No.

01:44:27.193 --> 01:44:29.362
No, no, Ryan!

01:44:29.395 --> 01:44:30.664
Ryan, I didn't,

01:44:31.631 --> 01:44:33.700
I-I-I didn't know.

01:44:34.500 --> 01:44:35.601
Ryan?

01:44:35.635 --> 01:44:36.470
Ryan!

01:44:38.371 --> 01:44:39.439
Ryan, wait!

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:47.212
Please, Ryan, listen to me!

01:45:23.682 --> 01:45:24.650
It's okay.

01:45:30.922 --> 01:45:32.391
I'll always

01:45:34.694 --> 01:45:35.962
be here.

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:42.602
Remember.

01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:06.359
It's like there's
a hole in his mind.

01:46:06.391 --> 01:46:07.693
You
have to remember

01:46:07.726 --> 01:46:10.063
what I am saying to you, Ryan!

01:46:10.095 --> 01:46:12.531
It was an
incredibly traumatic event.

01:46:12.564 --> 01:46:16.135
He may subconsciously choose
to block it out forever.

01:46:16.168 --> 01:46:19.305
He doesn't even
remember his own sister!

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:24.176
Have you
seen that picture before?

01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:25.444
I miss him.

01:46:25.478 --> 01:46:28.047
Who? Who do you miss?

01:46:28.079 --> 01:46:29.314
Dad.

01:46:29.347 --> 01:46:30.817
Is he
the only one you miss?

01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:32.018
What do you mean?

01:46:32.051 --> 01:46:33.453
In that photo.

01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:38.658
Happy birthday, Ryan!

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:41.059
Mostly,
they're just observers,

01:46:41.092 --> 01:46:42.429
lurkers, they call 'em.

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:43.997
They don't interact directly.

01:46:44.029 --> 01:46:45.965
They just observe
the natural events

01:46:45.997 --> 01:46:47.400
in our time-space continuum.

01:46:49.668 --> 01:46:51.171
They're not watchers.

01:46:51.203 --> 01:46:53.739
They want this
world for their own.

01:46:53.773 --> 01:46:56.609
I've seen what
those things can do.

01:46:56.641 --> 01:46:58.845
They get into your subconscious,

01:46:58.877 --> 01:47:00.947
they manipulate everything!

01:47:00.979 --> 01:47:03.015
That's how they get in.

01:47:03.048 --> 01:47:04.984
That's how it begins.

01:47:06.685 --> 01:47:07.853
It's for you.

01:47:07.886 --> 01:47:10.222
Maybe this will help
you forget the bad times

01:47:10.256 --> 01:47:11.992
and remember the good ones.

01:47:12.891 --> 01:47:14.359
You still have it.

01:47:14.393 --> 01:47:16.229
I've
never taken it off.

01:47:18.163 --> 01:47:20.966
Some books
are very special, Ryan.

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.604
Some books can change your life.

01:47:25.805 --> 01:47:27.006
Come on, hit me!

01:47:27.038 --> 01:47:28.841
Come on! Hit me, pussy!

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:33.279
Our whole
lives, everything,

01:47:33.311 --> 01:47:35.314
everything has led up to this!

01:47:35.347 --> 01:47:38.184
How can you ask me to
turn and walk away?

01:47:38.216 --> 01:47:39.685
Finish it.

01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:40.920
There's a bomb.

01:47:40.953 --> 01:47:42.155
A what?

01:47:42.188 --> 01:47:43.823
In the lab,
there's some crazy guy.

01:47:43.855 --> 01:47:45.090
He's got a bomb

01:47:45.123 --> 01:47:46.658
- inside the event chamber.
- Caitlin.

01:47:46.692 --> 01:47:48.560
You have
to fight them, Ryan!

01:47:48.594 --> 01:47:50.596
You have to resist!

01:48:09.314 --> 01:48:11.783
Warning! Warning!

01:48:11.817 --> 01:48:13.854
Safety protocols disengaged.

01:48:15.387 --> 01:48:19.024
Attention! Blast door lock
release sequence failure.

01:48:19.057 --> 01:48:20.726
Unable to override.

01:48:29.668 --> 01:48:30.869
It's time.

01:48:47.853 --> 01:48:50.155
Remote
activation sequence enabled.

01:48:50.189 --> 01:48:52.425
Portal activation
sequence initiated.

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:56.829
Danger! Danger!

01:48:56.862 --> 01:48:58.931
Safety protocol failure.

01:48:58.965 --> 01:49:00.800
Human life in extremis.

01:49:03.536 --> 01:49:04.337
Hold on.

01:49:06.905 --> 01:49:08.942
Access
denied, access denied.

01:49:08.975 --> 01:49:10.410
He picked me.

01:49:13.578 --> 01:49:15.414
God picked me.

01:49:15.448 --> 01:49:16.682
Access
denied, terminal override,

01:49:16.716 --> 01:49:18.718
unable to comply.

01:49:18.751 --> 01:49:23.757
This is God's will,
and I am his messenger.

01:49:24.489 --> 01:49:26.992
This is God's will.

01:49:27.025 --> 01:49:28.193
This is God's will.

01:49:31.497 --> 01:49:33.533
This is how it ends.

01:49:34.699 --> 01:49:38.237
This is God's will and
I am his messenger.

01:49:38.270 --> 01:49:41.307
This is how the world
is supposed to end!

01:49:43.141 --> 01:49:47.012
This is how the world
is supposed to end!

01:49:48.447 --> 01:49:51.384
This is how the world ends!

01:49:55.988 --> 01:49:57.690
Activation
sequence complete.

01:49:57.722 --> 01:50:00.193
Terminal override accepted.

01:50:00.225 --> 01:50:04.296
Releasing blast
doors in five, four,

01:50:04.329 --> 01:50:06.599
three, two, one..

01:50:22.914 --> 01:50:25.752
Three, five,
three, four.

01:50:25.784 --> 01:50:27.052
Remote activation
sequence enabled.

01:50:27.086 --> 01:50:28.887
Override activation
sequence initiated.

01:50:28.921 --> 01:50:30.289
- Surprise!
- This was fun.

01:50:30.322 --> 01:50:31.791
We should do it again some time.

01:50:31.823 --> 01:50:33.259
The world's
first temporal manipulation...

01:50:33.292 --> 01:50:34.827
You're going to
change the world, Ryan Winrich.

01:50:34.859 --> 01:50:37.063
- I have a feeling about you.
- What kind of feeling?

01:50:37.095 --> 01:50:38.397
She
likes you, you know.

01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:39.498
I can sense these things.

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:40.733
Your friends
won't always be there!

01:50:40.765 --> 01:50:41.833
Oh, I'll be there!

01:50:41.867 --> 01:50:42.969
I'll always be here.

01:50:43.002 --> 01:50:43.970
It's for you.

01:50:44.002 --> 01:50:45.438
Maybe this will help
you forget the bad times

01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:46.671
and remember the good ones.

01:50:46.706 --> 01:50:48.007
Any conductive
metals would cause the portal

01:50:48.039 --> 01:50:48.908
to lose stability and collapse.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:50.676
This is
how the world ends!

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:57.810
Most people live
life between the moments,

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:02.782
never truly seeing what's
right in front of them,

01:52:04.516 --> 01:52:06.586
until the moment is gone.

01:52:11.890 --> 01:52:14.460
It's easy to be afraid.

01:52:16.561 --> 01:52:18.163
But if you can

01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:21.201
face the moment,

01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:25.872
everything else becomes clear.

01:54:02.568 --> 01:54:04.337
Remember.

01:54:55.186 --> 01:54:59.858
