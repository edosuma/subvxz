WEBVTT

00:04.938 --> 00:06.240
Previously on E.R.:

00:06.274 --> 00:07.375
Listen... let me go.

00:07.408 --> 00:08.542
I can explain everything.

00:08.576 --> 00:10.244
I can't be arrested!

00:10.278 --> 00:12.046
Do you even know if there's
a flight out tonight?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.647
Yep. United.
9:30 to Omaha.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.283
Hi.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.518
You called her?

00:17.551 --> 00:18.786
The most unreliable

00:18.819 --> 00:20.321
undependable person
in our lives?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.822
And you're dependable?

00:21.855 --> 00:23.591
Yeah, to you I am, yes.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.093
This is about Eric.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.427
You can't go back
to the way you two were.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.162
There's no quick fix.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.398
Mom was out-of-her-mind crazy
and I'm not like that!

00:30.431 --> 00:31.432
It's 300 an hour.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.732
2,000 for the night.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.435
Give me some damn privacy.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.304
But I won.
It's all right--
I-I should go.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074

00:46.514 --> 00:48.649
( glass breaking )

01:08.136 --> 01:08.802
Where's Mom?

01:08.836 --> 01:10.371
You need cable.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.474
MAGGIE:
I broke a bowl--
I'm sorry.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.542
I'm making
scrambled.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.576
You want some?

01:15.609 --> 01:17.145
No.

01:17.145 --> 01:18.246
You got some cheese?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.413
Just the stuff in a can.

01:19.447 --> 01:21.249
What time is it?

01:21.282 --> 01:22.416
Almost 5:00.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.285
It's a little early
for breakfast

01:24.318 --> 01:25.619
don't you think?

01:25.653 --> 01:27.388
Not if it's your last supper.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.756
Nothing fresh?

01:28.789 --> 01:30.424
I'm not hungry anyway.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.460
MAGGIE:
You need to eat something.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.596
( quietly ):
He's been up since 3:00.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.831
Maybe you should
talk to him.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.735
Hey.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.771
What are you watching?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.473
Nothing.

01:45.506 --> 01:47.841
And everything.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.411
You having trouble
falling asleep?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.546
Trouble staying that way,
actually.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.384
Kind of a crappy neighborhood
you live in.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.552
You want to talk
about it?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.754
Tell me what's
going on?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.256
You had me medically discharged

02:02.290 --> 02:04.525
and I'm about to check
into a loony bin today.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.926
What do you think's
going on?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.895
( clears throat ):
Treatment center.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.630
It's one of the best
treatment centers

02:09.663 --> 02:11.432
in the city
and it's just days.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.634
My days.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.203
It's been a long trip.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.604
The more aggressively
we treat this now

02:16.637 --> 02:17.838
the better your
chances are of...

02:17.871 --> 02:19.340
My chances.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.608
MAGGIE:
I'm tired,
he's tired.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.210
We agreed, Eric.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.512
When the hell
did this become "we"?

02:24.545 --> 02:27.881
When you started having
to take Depakote.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.550
Is that how it works?

02:29.583 --> 02:32.653
Anything over 500 milligrams
gets you locked up?

02:32.686 --> 02:33.921
Eric...

02:33.954 --> 02:35.856
You're lucky
you're only 250.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.592
It's weight-based.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.229
CARTER:
Follow my finger

02:41.262 --> 02:42.796
with your eyes, Timmy.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.432
Good.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.434
WOMAN:
He came in saying
he had a headache.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.336
Swears up and down
nothing happened to him.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.471
And do you wear a helmet
when you ride a bike?

02:50.504 --> 02:51.672
Yeah, but I wasn't.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.407
Both of them
are on restriction.

02:53.441 --> 02:54.642
They can't play outside
the yard.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.277
Well, what were you guys
doing out there?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.511
Playing catch?

02:57.545 --> 02:58.912
Playing a little cops
and robbers?

02:58.946 --> 03:01.349
Knowing might help me
figure out

03:01.382 --> 03:04.352
whether Timmy needs
medicine or an operation.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.788
Or both.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.723
Gravity.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.992
Is that some kind of game?

03:12.025 --> 03:15.463
Uh... I hold him up
by the ankles

03:15.496 --> 03:17.265
and see how long it takes

03:17.265 --> 03:19.600
for him to hit the ground
after I let go.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.302
One one-thousand.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.371
Okay. Chuny, let's get
a head CT, no contrast.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.538
You bet.

03:24.572 --> 03:25.839
How many times
have I told you

03:25.873 --> 03:27.341
not to torture
your little brother?

03:27.375 --> 03:28.276
Another Kodak moment?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.577
Kid has a concussion--

03:29.610 --> 03:31.379
still wouldn't
rat out his brother.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.713
That would make him
a squealer.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.316
It's a fate worse
than head trauma.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.284
When's Abby due back?

03:36.317 --> 03:36.984
She's back.
Yesterday.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.819
Yeah, everything okay?

03:38.852 --> 03:42.456
Yeah. I mean, other than
needing a vacation from
her vacation.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.292
Uh, no kidding.

03:44.325 --> 03:47.295
If I was stuck on a train
with my family...

03:47.328 --> 03:48.529
It's a bad example

03:48.562 --> 03:50.431
because I'd throw myself
on the tracks.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.299
See you tomorrow.
Bye.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.533
Not so fast.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.867
Weaver wants you
to cover her shift.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.336
That is the second
time this week!

03:55.369 --> 03:56.737
And it's only
Tuesday.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.772
Well, is she
moonlighting
or slacking?

03:58.806 --> 04:00.808
Dealing with labor negotiations,
is what I heard.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.876
Something like that.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.313
Well, so much
for salsa tonight.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.047
You losing
all your party pals?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.317
Yeah, well, between
work and boyfriends

04:09.350 --> 04:11.385
nobody seems to have
time for fun anymore.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.420
GIRL:
Excuse me.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.721
Are you doctors?

04:13.754 --> 04:16.656
Yeah, but you have to sign in
over at Triage.

04:16.690 --> 04:17.757
I can't do this.

04:17.791 --> 04:18.759
I-I just can't.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.560
( door opening )

04:20.594 --> 04:23.531
Should we look,
or call security?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.433
( baby crying )
Both.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.873
Less than an hour old.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.842
( baby continues crying )

05:33.801 --> 05:34.802
MAN:
Every day begins

05:34.835 --> 05:36.069
with 90 minutes
of group.

05:36.103 --> 05:38.038
Individual sessions
are twice a week

05:38.071 --> 05:40.908
with recreational therapies
rounding out the schedule.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.444
Monday through Friday?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.445
8:00 to 4:00.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.078
Busy day.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.714
Now, we have found

05:46.747 --> 05:49.016
that a four-pronged approach
is most effective:

05:49.049 --> 05:51.685
Therapy, structure,
social interaction

05:51.719 --> 05:52.720
and, of course, meds.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.121
ABBY:
Which you dispense?

05:54.154 --> 05:56.056
Absolutely.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.091
Uh, through there,
there's some lockers

05:58.125 --> 06:00.160
where patients can
store their belongings.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.595
We provide
a hot lunch

06:01.629 --> 06:03.531
and on occasion,
we take the group

06:03.564 --> 06:04.965
to nearby
cultural events.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.600
What about recess?

06:06.634 --> 06:08.101
Pardon me?

06:08.135 --> 06:10.538
I mean, no swings,
no monkey bars, no slides.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.439
Not even a merry-go-round.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.106
Eric.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.476
Honey, why don't we go talk
to some of the other people.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.578
Oh, oh, for bipolar
show-and-tell? Okay.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.085
There's always an
adjustment period.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.456
Um, will you be keeping him
on Zyprexa?

06:28.489 --> 06:30.591
You think he needs to
be on an anti-psychotic?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.926
He's had some delusional
thoughts with his mania.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.828
Well, before
prescribing anything

06:34.862 --> 06:37.465
I'll want to review
his medical records

06:37.465 --> 06:39.032
and of course,
talk with him.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.101
I don't know how much
cooperation you're going to get

06:41.134 --> 06:43.471
but I can probably tell you
anything you need to know.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.606
Mmm, be more helpful
coming from the patient.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.040
But down the line

06:47.074 --> 06:50.110
family therapy may well
be a part of the program.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.479
I'll let you know.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.547
( baby crying )

06:53.581 --> 06:54.715
Appears term.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.749
Skin's good.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.051
Well-perfused,
no jaundice.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.554
No ID, no information,
no nothing.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.755
Fontanel is soft

07:01.789 --> 07:03.591
a little sunken--
definitely dehydrated.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.192
HARKINS:
Do you think
she had any help?

07:05.225 --> 07:06.527
Delivering?
I doubt it.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.695
The umbilical cord
is clamped

07:07.728 --> 07:08.896
with a Powder Puff
Girls barrette.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.564
Powerpuff Girls.

07:10.598 --> 07:11.865
Um, so we just call
Social Services now, right?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.567
Safe Haven Law.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.603
A mom can drop off a newborn,
no questions asked.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.037
Bilateral red reflex.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.506
Pupils reactive.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.907
At least she did
the responsible thing.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.609
Did she?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.644
Yeah, the baby could've ended up
in the dumpster.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.778
But where's the father?

07:24.812 --> 07:25.779
Where's the girl's parents?

07:25.813 --> 07:27.180
Where's the girl?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.716
Out there living life
like nothing happened.

07:28.749 --> 07:30.083
Need a heel stick
for glucose.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.619
CHEN:
And a diaper.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.721
Double MVA:
12-year-old with ankle deformity

07:33.754 --> 07:34.822
and the driver is shocky

07:34.855 --> 07:35.723
with abdominal trauma.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.224
Kid's vitals okay?

07:37.257 --> 07:39.059
We'll find out,
they're rolling up right now.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.128
( crying continues )

07:41.161 --> 07:42.663
Coming?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.598
Uh, yeah.

07:44.632 --> 07:46.800
In a minute.

07:49.870 --> 07:50.804
He's vomiting.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.607
Let's turn him.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.543
Poster boy for blunt trauma.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.276
B.P. 100/72.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.110
Any LOC?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.579
Awake at the scene

07:58.612 --> 07:59.947
GCS 14 so far, but
he keeps heaving.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.549
Blood and urine
in his pants.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.115
Mr. Brenner,
I'm Dr. Carter.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.717
Morgan.

08:03.751 --> 08:04.885
HARMS:
His kid's
in the next rig.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.687
Your daughter's
right behind you.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.056
Let's page trauma surg down here
and set up for a chest tube.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.023
Hang in there.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.592
Where's my ten bucks?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.627
Right in my wallet,
where it's going to stay.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.029
Oh, you're still
making that "no shake,
no pay" noise again?

08:16.063 --> 08:17.698
Hi, I'm Erin.
What's your name?
Morgan.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.567
Good sats,
but left ankle deformity.

08:19.567 --> 08:20.868
No other injury.
Truck hit the driver's side.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.035
Where was she?

08:22.069 --> 08:23.671
Restrained in the back,
opposite.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.739
Daddy says he can keep
a better eye on me that way.

08:25.773 --> 08:26.874
Why, did you get
into trouble?

08:26.907 --> 08:28.308
No, he's a worrywart.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.277
CARTER:
Lateral C-spine, chest
and pelvis to start.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.645
It's just me...
Normal heart sound

08:31.679 --> 08:32.913
but decreased
on the left.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.313
Mr. Brenner,
can you open your mouth for me?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.783
Good radial pulses.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.684
No dental fractures.
Mandible stable.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.318
Her mother's gone...

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
CHUNY:
Sats 90.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.822
CHEN:
28 French on a
vascular clamp.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.591
Ooh, he's got a left
clavicular fracture.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.992
It's probably
a small pneumo.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.059
She doesn't understand...

08:46.093 --> 08:47.628
Ten blade.
This the MVA?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.329
Yeah, dropped a lung.
Check out the belly.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.163
Sonosite.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.632
I'm Dr. Corday.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.667
I'll be assessing your need
for surgery.

08:53.701 --> 08:54.935
Uh, hope not.
( groans )

08:54.968 --> 08:56.804
Tender abdomen, hypotensive.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.871
Tube's going in.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.608
CARTER:
Fluid in Morrison's.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.075
Mr. Brenner, you probably
have an injury

09:02.109 --> 09:03.276
to your internal organs

09:03.310 --> 09:05.012
which we'll need
to repair quickly.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.047
Is there anybody you'd like us
to call?

09:07.080 --> 09:07.748
Your wife?

09:07.781 --> 09:08.782
No.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.217
His daughter's next door.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.252
Need a cell saver
for the thoraseal.
On it.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.353
BRENNER:
Is it bad?

09:13.386 --> 09:14.755
CORDAY:
Stay with us, Mr. Brenner.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.990
Extra cell saver in here?

09:17.024 --> 09:18.692
Oh, catch.

09:18.726 --> 09:19.993
DP and PT pulses strong.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.629
Is he going
to be okay?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.230
Your father's in
good hands, Morgan.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.798
Yeah, that's right.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
We got our second-best doctor
working on him.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.301
Second?

09:28.335 --> 09:30.037
Well, number one's
working with you

09:30.070 --> 09:31.204
isn't he?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.773
Looks like a distal tib fib.

09:32.806 --> 09:33.841
Let's get her down
to X ray.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.175
Where are they
taking him?

09:35.208 --> 09:36.644
PRATT:
He might need a test

09:36.677 --> 09:38.011
we can't perform here
in the E.R.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.180
Or surgery.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.115
Hey, you got a favorite color?

09:42.149 --> 09:43.751
Yeah, why?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.385
Well, we'll need to put
a cast on your ankle

09:45.418 --> 09:47.054
and we've got all the colors

09:47.087 --> 09:48.188
of the rainbow.

09:48.221 --> 09:49.723
I like pink.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.993
( chuckles ):
Me, too.

09:53.026 --> 09:58.666
Look for images
that best describe your feelings

09:58.699 --> 10:02.002
during the hypomanic phases
of your illness.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.773
Hey, does anybody have
a Viagra ad?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.374
Kidding.

10:07.407 --> 10:11.011
We find that this exercise
really helps them to identify

10:11.044 --> 10:14.247
the seductive side
of their mania.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.116
It seems so simple.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.951
Has to be
in the beginning.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.687
They are used
to chaos--

10:19.720 --> 10:21.789
to acting on
their impulses.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.792
This allows them to
move into a world

10:24.825 --> 10:27.060
of structure and
self-discipline.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.697
He'll adapt.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.733
Obviously, you did.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.967
See you this afternoon.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.035
Thanks, Doctor.

10:36.003 --> 10:36.970
You ready?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.872
I guess.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.941
ABBY:
Is something wrong?

10:40.974 --> 10:41.942
MAGGIE:
No.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
Mom?

10:43.343 --> 10:46.213
You think this is the
right facility for him?

10:46.246 --> 10:48.448
Okay. How did I know
that was coming?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.250
I'm not saying it's not

10:50.283 --> 10:53.854
but seeing it, seeing what
they're making him do...

10:53.887 --> 10:56.189
Okay, the collages
are stupid.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.925
That's only one part
of the therapy.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.860
It'd be great if he
was ten years old.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.729
Well, emotionally,
he pretty much is.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.864
No, he's not.

11:03.897 --> 11:07.234
Okay, 15 then.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.836
MAGGIE:
I know how he feels.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.271
Like we're trying to take away
his personality--

11:11.304 --> 11:12.973
the thing he likes
about being him.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.108
Which is also the thing
that is destroying him.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.376
What if he does it
independently?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.911
Sees a psychiatrist,
gets a job

11:17.945 --> 11:19.913
tries to learn how to deal
with this on his own.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.048
That would be great.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.449
How do you keep him
on his meds?

11:22.482 --> 11:24.117
You can't force meds,
or this so-called therapy

11:24.151 --> 11:25.485
down your brother's throat.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.054
( chuckles ):
"So-called therapy."

11:27.087 --> 11:29.456
If he's not ready for it,
it won't work.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.091
Oh, and you know
what will?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.192
Why do you do that?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.360
We're not talking about me.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.062
Why do you always shove it
in my face?

11:35.095 --> 11:37.831
Because you keep insisting
that you're the expert.

11:37.865 --> 11:38.932
That you know best.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.500
Maybe this once I do.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.270
You know, you are
not exactly cured.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.239
And he needs someone
stable to help get
him through this.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.407
I'm his mother.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.441
Oh, come on.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.879
Come on, you've been
in and out of hospitals

11:51.912 --> 11:53.213
for the past 30 years.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.015
You're not anybody's mother.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.954
Okay, wait.

12:00.988 --> 12:02.022
CHEN:
Well, he looks good.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.323
How's he doing?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.793
Temp's normal,
pulse down to 140.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.227
I think he likes it here.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.461
CHEN:
No beds upstairs, huh?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.830
I don't mind.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.998
It's nice to have
a healthy baby

12:11.031 --> 12:12.465
down here for a change.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.968
Hmm. Repeat the bolus
of 20cc's per kilo.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.304
Then try him on 30cc's
of Enfamil q two hours

12:17.337 --> 12:18.972
until Pedes takes him up.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.508
I don't know how anybody
could give him away.

12:21.541 --> 12:24.211
Well, I'm sure she had
her reasons.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.846
Call me if he won't feed.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.447
GALLANT:
45-year-old woman presenting

12:27.480 --> 12:30.217
with four hours of abdominal
pain and vomiting times ten.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.052
Epigastric tenderness
without rebound.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.386
Hey, Deb, have you
seen Kovac anywhere?

12:33.420 --> 12:34.554
Nope. Sorry.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.056
( sighs ):
Of course not.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.557
He's only the swing shift
attending...

12:37.590 --> 12:40.393
Well, hemoglobin's
normal, as are LFTs.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.295
...the doctor you should be
presenting to...

12:42.329 --> 12:43.897
UA and ICON are
normal and negative.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.498
...but apparently,
I'm the only one around here

12:45.532 --> 12:47.034
with a work ethic.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.435
So, I'm thinking,
uh, food poisoning

12:48.468 --> 12:51.839
gastroenteritis, uh,
but she has intractable vomiting

12:51.872 --> 12:53.874
despite Compazine
and Reglan.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.476
Hi, I'm Dr, Lewis.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.945
How are you doing?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.212
Not so good.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.414
Otherwise you wouldn't be here,
right?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.350
Do you know
what's wrong?

13:03.383 --> 13:05.485
It's okay, he's my boyfriend.

13:05.518 --> 13:09.256
Your test show an anion gap
which could be due to vomiting

13:09.289 --> 13:11.558
dehydration,
a lactic acidosis.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.927
We'll need to run some more
tests to make sure.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.429
So, will you need to admit me?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.365
You hate hospitals
as much as I do?

13:18.398 --> 13:20.133
You kidding?
She lives in them.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.068
I'm an R.N.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.535
So as a nurse, you know

13:22.569 --> 13:24.204
we can't send you home
if we can't control

13:24.237 --> 13:25.572
your vomiting.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.440
Yeah, and she can't come
to my house, either--

13:27.474 --> 13:28.876
I just got new rugs.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.211
Just kidding.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.412
( sighs )

13:32.445 --> 13:34.481
We'll be right back.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.621
Let's give Mr. Brenner
another 25 of fentanyl.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.890
You got it.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.259
Are you comfortable?

13:46.293 --> 13:48.929
BRENNER:
No.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.430
How long will I be out?

13:50.463 --> 13:53.200
First, we need to identify
then stop the hemorrhage.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.102
We may also have
to remove your spleen.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.904
No. Out of commission.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.239
There's a possibility
you may have injured
your bowel.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.941
If that's the case

14:00.974 --> 14:03.310
it'll require a pull-down
to reattach your intestines

14:03.343 --> 14:05.178
after the damage has healed.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.314
My daughter?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.016
Morgan has a fractured ankle.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.550
I understand she's doing fine.

14:10.583 --> 14:13.653
Are you sure we can't contact
your wife for you?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.588
She barely remembers her.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.090
Sorry?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.458
She left us.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.427
Your wife passed away?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.594
No, no, no.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.630
She couldn't be there for her

14:23.663 --> 14:26.499
so she left it to me
to be the mom and dad.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.369
KOVAC:
I need some help over here.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.604
Kovac, you're late.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.672
Blame my alarm clock.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.141
Oh, yeah, what's her name?

14:34.174 --> 14:35.675
Probable hip fracture,
82-year-old woman.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.945
Went down in her kitchen.
Not "old woman." Matilda!

14:37.978 --> 14:39.579
B.P.'s 100 palp, pulse 120.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.680
Gave her 500 of saline.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.182
Left hip is ecchymotic

14:42.215 --> 14:44.584
with shortened leg
and externally rotated foot.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.585
Beautiful name
you have.

14:45.618 --> 14:46.419
Bruising on top
of the leg.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.420
When did she fall?

14:47.454 --> 14:49.156
Figure a couple of days ago.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.523
Landlord found her
'cause she was late
with her rent.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.624
She taking anything?

14:51.658 --> 14:52.960
Would've if she could've.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.462
Found enalapril
and glipizide

14:55.495 --> 14:57.130
A diabetic.
Lucky she's not in a coma.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.031
Coming through.
Precious cargo.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.599
Watch it.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.601
You know what,
we're putting you
in another bed, okay?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.503
Yeah, one in which
we can keep an eye on you.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.238
From what I hear,
you're a troublemaker.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.639
Is there a bathroom
anywhere?

15:06.673 --> 15:07.975
Uh, it's down the hall

15:08.008 --> 15:09.276
but I need to find
a wheelchair.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.543
What she means is

15:10.577 --> 15:12.479
that they've been getting
stolen lately.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.014
Well, I kind of
have to go bad.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.048
Better get a bedpan, then.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.283
And go here?

15:16.316 --> 15:17.584
Don't worry,
we'll close the door

15:17.617 --> 15:18.451
and give you
some privacy.

15:18.485 --> 15:19.686
You need some help?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.488
No, I think I can
do it by myself.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.256
Okay.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.528
Here. Push four of morphine
and find her mother's number.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.231
Pop's going to be in
surgery for a while.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.599
( clattering )

15:32.632 --> 15:35.002
MORGAN:
It's okay!

15:35.002 --> 15:37.404
Go ahead.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.638
( knocking )

15:38.671 --> 15:39.672
Hey, Morgan, I'm coming in.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.008
No, don't!

15:41.008 --> 15:42.642
Oh, my God!

15:42.675 --> 15:44.711
You're a boy.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.215
A 12-year-old
cross dresser?

15:48.248 --> 15:49.549
All I know is anatomically,
she's a he.

15:49.582 --> 15:50.750
And you're sure
about that?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.185
I've seen my fair share
of penises.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.486
Really?

15:53.520 --> 15:55.122
Anyway, she's...
uh, he's pretty upset

15:55.155 --> 15:56.656
and I think
you should talk to him.

15:56.689 --> 15:57.690
You found the mom yet?

15:57.724 --> 15:58.725
I'm working on it.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.127
No, work faster.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.068
Hey.

16:08.101 --> 16:09.736
How you doing?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.704
I want to see my dad.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.773
He's still in surgery.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.076
How much longer?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.111
I don't know.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.054
So, what's the deal?

16:27.087 --> 16:31.058
Why are you going around
dressed like a girl?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
Because I am one.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.327
I have the wrong body.

16:34.361 --> 16:35.662
You're kind of young

16:35.695 --> 16:37.230
to be thinking that way,
aren't you?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.066
No, I always have.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.668
Is your dad
in on this, too?

16:41.701 --> 16:46.173
He moved us so
I can start over
at a new school.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.108
Nobody knows.

16:48.141 --> 16:51.544
Well, they're going to find out
eventually, don't you think?

16:51.578 --> 16:53.580
Not if we keep moving.

16:53.613 --> 16:58.785
And when I'm old enough,
I'm going to get the operation.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.224
What does your mom
have to say about that?

17:05.258 --> 17:09.096
She has a different family now.

17:11.263 --> 17:14.334
Look, um, your dad's
going to be a while

17:14.367 --> 17:17.137
and we need someone
to come get you.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.839
My dad's friend lives near us.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.242
No, I think your mom
would be more appropriate.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.609
She thinks I'm a freak

17:23.643 --> 17:27.114
just like you do.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.118
Please.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.623
What's this friend's name?

17:36.656 --> 17:37.824
So, what do we do?

17:37.857 --> 17:38.791
Who do we call?

17:38.825 --> 17:39.826
Don't do anything.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.561
Oh, G! G!

17:41.594 --> 17:42.829
Leon, what
are you doing here?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.564
( sobbing ):
He made me leave.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.665
Who?

17:45.698 --> 17:46.833
He gave me no reason.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.835
He just told me
that I was fired.

17:48.868 --> 17:49.769
What?

17:49.802 --> 17:51.204
He was mean, G.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.439
He hit me with a broom.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.840
I didn't even do nothing.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.442
Pratt,
Urology, line one.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.510
Yeah, take a message.
Come on.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.479
In all my spare time. Hold.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.149
County.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.184
Someone's asking for you.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.885
Did you get a name?

18:05.918 --> 18:09.556
Anita Coffee.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.524
Is that a pseudonym
or a cry for help?

18:11.558 --> 18:12.325
Pretty clever, huh?

18:12.359 --> 18:13.726
Hey.
Hi.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.595
It's freezing;
why didn't you come inside?

18:15.628 --> 18:17.730
Didn't feel like
dealing with
anybody, I guess.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.466
Did you get someone
to cover for you?

18:19.499 --> 18:20.733
Yeah.
Is everything okay?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.635
Yeah, just need
a little company.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.504
I was hoping
the mailman would come.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.473
KOVAC:
Good pedal pulses.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.408
Is the pain medicine working?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.510
I don't get much mail.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.779
No letters from your grandkids?

18:32.812 --> 18:34.681
Oh, junk, mostly.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.183
Matilda, I need you to be quiet

18:36.183 --> 18:37.784
while I listen to
your chest, okay?

18:37.817 --> 18:39.486
2/6 systolic
ejection murmur.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.321
Matilda?

18:42.789 --> 18:43.856
How much fentanyl
did she get?

18:43.890 --> 18:44.924
100 mikes.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.359
That wouldn't
knock her out.

18:46.393 --> 18:47.427
Might be a CVA.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.761
She could be losing
her airway.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.498
Matilda, wake up.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.799
Got 'em.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.468
Initial glucose is 576,
bichem is normal.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.704
Not DKA, maybe
hyperosmolar coma.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.938
I'll check
for the gag.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.508
( gagging )

19:01.541 --> 19:04.644
What the hell are you doing?!

19:04.677 --> 19:05.912
Are you okay?

19:05.945 --> 19:07.480
I was having a nice rest

19:07.514 --> 19:09.849
till this bitch
started choking me.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.817
Nice.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.585
Dr. Lewis

19:12.619 --> 19:13.753
this is Jeremy Cranston.

19:13.786 --> 19:14.887
He's here to
see his mother.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.223
Oh, yeah-- Hi, Jeremy.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.290
Right this way.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.491
I got home
and a neighbor said

19:18.525 --> 19:19.326
she went
to the hospital.

19:19.359 --> 19:20.893
What happened?

19:20.927 --> 19:22.729
Well, apparently she started
throwing up this morning.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.431
Throwing up?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.765
Yeah, we think
she might have
food poisoning

19:25.798 --> 19:27.300
but we're not sure.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.568
What did you have
for dinner last night?

19:28.601 --> 19:30.403
We had steak;
I'm not sick.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.572
Yeah, well, like
I said, we're still
working on it.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.343
Mom, how come
you didn't call me?

19:36.376 --> 19:38.445
I thought you
were going to.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.846
I didn't get a chance.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.748
I'll get another chair.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.550
Honey, you don't
have to stay and
watch me sleep.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.917
I want to.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.286
Besides, Bill's
got to go to work, right?

19:46.319 --> 19:47.854
No, that's okay,
I can stay.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.925
Let me get you
something to read.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.427
Thanks, honey.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.828
The gift store's
upstairs.

19:55.862 --> 19:58.365
Um, if you need anything
official, or whatever

19:58.398 --> 19:59.932
ask me and not
her boyfriend, okay?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.401
Is there a problem?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.603
No, he's just
kind of a jerk sometimes.

20:06.439 --> 20:07.940
CARTER:
So, how was it left?

20:07.974 --> 20:10.943
She went back to my apartment,
I came here.

20:13.513 --> 20:16.549
I'll pick him up tonight,
we'll all have dinner

20:16.583 --> 20:19.352
it will be fine...
as soon as she leaves.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.822
What happens then?

20:22.855 --> 20:26.526
Then, Eric and I will get into
a routine with his treatment

20:26.559 --> 20:30.263
and I'll work days so I can
keep an eye on him at night.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.265
Really?
And I'll probably get

20:32.299 --> 20:35.335
a bigger apartment, I guess.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.270
You're going
to be roommates now.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
Well, I can't
just let him wander off

20:39.306 --> 20:40.507
and hope for the best.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.575
He needs my help.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.314
You think that's too much?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.783
I think that it's
a responsibility

20:50.817 --> 20:51.884
that you could share.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.854
With who? Maggie?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.824
( rueful chuckle )

20:57.857 --> 20:58.791
Do you know

20:58.825 --> 21:00.059
when she would leave us

21:00.092 --> 21:01.828
she used to do it
when we were sleeping?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.796
Did I ever
tell you that?

21:03.830 --> 21:06.933
So, it became part
of our morning routine.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.435
We would get up, go pee

21:08.468 --> 21:11.003
check and see
if Mom had abandoned us.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.440
And on the mornings
when she was gone

21:13.473 --> 21:15.708
I was left
with my little brother--

21:15.742 --> 21:19.546
this skinny little kid who
never, ever did anything wrong

21:19.579 --> 21:23.516
and was good
and beautiful and sweet--

21:23.550 --> 21:25.385
and I would have to tell him

21:25.418 --> 21:27.820
that everything
was going to be okay.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.059
What would he say?

21:35.928 --> 21:38.465
"You're a liar."

21:45.505 --> 21:46.639
Still V-tach.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.740
Amp of epi. Charge.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.509
Epi in, lido in.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.945
Why tell me all
that if you're not
going to fight?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.648
Clear.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.450
Still V-tach.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.786
You have a daughter
who needs you, damn it.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.988
Charge to 300. Clear.

22:03.923 --> 22:04.991
Asystole.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.393
Change the leads;
make sure.

22:06.426 --> 22:07.860
Just do it.
It's not the leads.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.731
Clear.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.099
Still flatline.

22:13.132 --> 22:15.535
The leads are fine.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.504
Milligram of atropine,
five more of epi.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.005
He's oozing everywhere.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.940
No pulse,
no pressure.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.976
( sighing )

22:24.010 --> 22:25.878
God, I hate this.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.050
We'll keep you comfortable

22:31.083 --> 22:33.586
till they are ready
for you in surgery.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.422
All my life,
I've been terrified

22:35.422 --> 22:36.823
of going
under the knife.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.891
Done everything I could
to avoid it.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.027
You'll be fine.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.029
No wedding ring.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.031
Good-looking man
like you?

22:45.064 --> 22:47.967
Oh, it's okay now.

22:48.000 --> 22:56.943
But before-- being alone,
being a spinster-- terrible.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.746
Called women like me
"lonely hearts."

22:59.779 --> 23:01.514
Were you?

23:01.548 --> 23:04.451
No more than a lot of women
I knew who were married.

23:06.118 --> 23:07.587
Oh, what the hell.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.991
Gave me time
to improve my chess game.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.960
I'm a killer.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.862
Is that right?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.864
Damn well better be at my age.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.966
Maybe we should play sometime.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.935
I'm pretty
good myself.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.036
And what
about Mr. Boyle?

23:24.070 --> 23:25.472
Uh, refresh my memory.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.474
Compulsive overeater
with abdominal pain.

23:27.474 --> 23:28.975
Oh, yeah, give
him an extra lunch

23:29.008 --> 23:30.977
and pray a bed
opens up in Psych.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.078
Oh, and Dr. Weaver
called

23:32.111 --> 23:33.513
and asked
that you cover

23:33.546 --> 23:35.515
the Finance Committee
meeting at 2:00.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.649
She asked?

23:36.683 --> 23:37.650
Well, not exactly.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.519
Dr. Lewis.

23:39.552 --> 23:42.822
I used to think that
would be so cool to
hear-- "Dr. Lewis."

23:42.855 --> 23:45.024
Toxicology came back
on Melody Cranston.

23:45.057 --> 23:48.127
Negative for drugs of abuse,
serum iron level normal.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.228
Any osmolal gap?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.763
No, but
her salicylate level

23:50.797 --> 23:52.198
is 41 milligrams
per deciliter.

23:52.231 --> 23:53.500
Aspirin overdose?

23:53.500 --> 23:54.534
Well, it looks
that way.

23:54.567 --> 23:55.935
She's a nurse, she knows better.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.970
She also knows
that's not a lethal enough dose

23:58.004 --> 23:59.839
to do anything
but make her sick.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.207
Do me a favor;
pull her medical records.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.675
Munchausen's?

24:02.709 --> 24:03.910
Maybe she wants
to get medical attention

24:03.943 --> 24:05.044
instead of giving it.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.579
OLIGARIO:
Dr. Lewis.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.847
What?

24:07.880 --> 24:10.149
What do you think
of the name Elias?

24:10.182 --> 24:11.718
Don't ask me.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.052
I named my dog Puddles.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.621
Talk about a self-
fulfilling prophecy.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.222
Somebody getting a dog?

24:16.255 --> 24:17.924
No, we're just
trying to come
up with a name

24:17.957 --> 24:19.158
for the
abandoned baby.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.860
Which do you like better,
Percy or Oliver?

24:20.893 --> 24:22.028
Rudyard.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.896
Hasn't he
suffered enough?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.898
What's the matter with Rudyard?

24:25.932 --> 24:27.233
CORDAY:
John.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.936
I'm afraid
Mr. Brenner didn't make it.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.571
Where's his daughter?

24:31.604 --> 24:33.039
Uh, Pratt was
treating her.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.240
She might be
in Exam One.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.608
Does she
have family here?

24:35.642 --> 24:36.943
Hey, Harkins?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.778
You worked on
Brenner's kid, right?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.012
Yeah.

24:40.046 --> 24:41.648
CORDAY:
Did you reach
the mother?

24:41.681 --> 24:43.182
Dr. Pratt said
he was going to handle it.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.651
CARTER:
Did he?

24:44.684 --> 24:45.918
I don't know,
he's on a break.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.920
Well, the girl's father
just died.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.556
Boy.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.558
What?

24:51.558 --> 24:52.725
Uh, Morgan's a boy.

24:52.759 --> 24:55.127
I guess the proper term
is transsexual.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.663
Uh, wait, I'm sorry.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.965
His daughter
is actually his son?

24:58.998 --> 25:00.299
Yes, I wanted
to call the mother

25:00.332 --> 25:01.233
but Dr. Pratt
didn't.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.735
Did you get
the number?

25:02.769 --> 25:04.270
Mr. Brenner
mentioned an estrangement.

25:04.303 --> 25:05.572
Harkins?

25:05.572 --> 25:06.906
Yes, I have it.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.641
Then call.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.677
She's next of kin.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.917
Have a good night.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.186
Hi. How did it go today?

25:20.219 --> 25:21.921
Not so well.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.991
He left.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.959
What do you mean, he left?

25:26.993 --> 25:29.061
He withdrew
from the program.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.963
And went where?

25:30.997 --> 25:33.299
You should probably
ask your mother that.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.801
Excuse me?

25:34.834 --> 25:38.004
She came and got him
about an hour ago.

25:45.978 --> 25:47.914
I got no problem
with you.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.181
Fire Leon and you do.

25:49.215 --> 25:50.883
Use a broom on him

25:50.917 --> 25:52.719
and you've got an even
bigger problem with me.

25:52.752 --> 25:53.953
He wouldn't leave.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.187
The man shows up
on time every day

25:55.221 --> 25:56.756
works his ass off
for you

25:56.789 --> 25:58.290
and does every damn thing
you tell him to do.

25:58.324 --> 25:59.859
So when he gets
kicked to the curb

25:59.892 --> 26:01.260
maybe he doesn't
understand that.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.930
Somebody gets into my store
after hours, with a key.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.364
How the hell
you think they got one?

26:05.397 --> 26:07.233
Think I left it
in the door?

26:07.266 --> 26:09.201
For all I know,
Leon ripped me off himself.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.269
No, no, no, no.

26:10.302 --> 26:11.303
He's not like that.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.672
Everybody's like that.

26:12.705 --> 26:13.673
Even if it was his friends

26:13.706 --> 26:14.741
then they tricked him.

26:14.774 --> 26:15.775
He wouldn't
have a clue.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.143
Let me tell you something.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.878
That dumb ass brother
of yours ain't so dumb.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.112
Hey.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.380
The man took
a bullet to the head.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.281
He's not dumb.

26:22.314 --> 26:23.683
Get away from me.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.384
Look, he wouldn't do this.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.354
Get away or I'm calling
the cops on you and him.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.222
Leave Leon out of this.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.958
You understand me?

26:31.991 --> 26:33.826
Leave him out of it.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.263
CARTER:
Mrs. Garding?

26:37.296 --> 26:38.698
What happened?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.867
Hi, I'm Dr. Carter.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.101
I don't know how much

26:42.134 --> 26:43.335
you were told over
the telephone...

26:43.369 --> 26:44.403
Next to nothing.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.872
Your ex-husband
and your son

26:45.905 --> 26:47.406
were involved
in a car accident.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.975
Morgan has
a broken ankle

26:49.008 --> 26:50.276
it's relatively
minor.

26:50.309 --> 26:52.378
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.313
Mr. Brenner's injuries,
however

26:54.346 --> 26:55.815
were far more extensive

26:55.848 --> 26:57.149
and...

26:57.183 --> 26:58.685
Did he die?

26:59.919 --> 27:01.387
Oh, my God.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.423
I understand that
it's been some time

27:04.456 --> 27:06.325
since you've
seen Morgan.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.327
Three years.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.731
And are you, um...

27:11.764 --> 27:15.802
are you aware that he's
been living as a girl?

27:17.804 --> 27:21.107
His father and I disagreed
on how to handle that.

27:21.140 --> 27:25.044
Morgan wanted to live with
his dad, so I didn't fight it.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.847
Morgan hasn't been told
about his father's death.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.716
I can't be the one.
I'm sorry.

27:29.749 --> 27:30.850
That's okay,
that's okay.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.318
I can take care
of that for you.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.722
I do think it would be
better if you were there.

27:37.256 --> 27:38.357
Okay.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.827
( sighs )

27:40.860 --> 27:43.963
Morgan's going to need
crutches for about six weeks

27:43.996 --> 27:46.032
and there's a chance
that he may require

27:46.065 --> 27:47.333
a little physical therapy.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.236
Otherwise, he should
recover fully.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.738
Good.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.341
Morgan?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.777
What's wrong?

27:59.411 --> 28:00.947
Honey...

28:02.949 --> 28:04.951
What are you doing here?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.786
Where's my dad?

28:10.790 --> 28:13.793
Morgan, your dad was hurt
very badly in the accident.

28:13.826 --> 28:14.927
No.

28:14.961 --> 28:16.763
And we did what we could
for him here

28:16.763 --> 28:18.865
and then he went up
to an operating room...

28:18.898 --> 28:20.199
No!

28:20.232 --> 28:22.902
They worked on him
for a very long time

28:22.935 --> 28:25.204
in the hopes that his heart
would start pumping again...

28:25.237 --> 28:27.406
No.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.309
But it didn't

28:30.342 --> 28:32.244
and he died.

28:32.278 --> 28:33.345
No!

28:33.379 --> 28:35.214
No, no, no!

28:35.247 --> 28:37.449
It's going to be okay.

28:37.483 --> 28:41.888
Sweetie, I'll take
care of you, okay?

28:41.921 --> 28:45.925
I'll take care
of everything.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.194
How soon before I can
play basketball again?

28:48.227 --> 28:49.395
Uh, soon.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.231
After the reduction,
put Mr. Trotter

28:52.264 --> 28:55.334
in a sugar tong splint
until the swelling goes down.

28:55.367 --> 28:58.170
And a short arm cast
for six weeks after that.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.372
Your ears get red
when you lie.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.813
How are you holding up, Matilda?

29:06.813 --> 29:09.816
You don't even
have to try, do you?

29:09.849 --> 29:11.450
Sorry?

29:11.483 --> 29:14.120
With women.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.055
I, uh, checked with surgery.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.324
They should be ready
to take you up in an hour or so.

29:18.357 --> 29:21.427
Is that pronounced "Ko-vack"?

29:21.460 --> 29:23.429
"Ko-vach."

29:23.462 --> 29:25.564
Um, spell your first name

29:25.597 --> 29:27.033
for me, please.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.200
What are you doing?

29:28.234 --> 29:29.468
Oh, tipping you.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.838
You seem like
a nice young man.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.339
I can't accept your money.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.573
Why not?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.876
Because you need it
for yourself.

29:36.909 --> 29:40.046
I never had
a soul to spend it on.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.281
Not even a cat.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.984
I'm frugal, I'm 82.

29:45.017 --> 29:49.121
Trust me, I have enough to last.

29:49.155 --> 29:50.923
No, I can't.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.058
Says who?

29:52.091 --> 29:53.525
Take it.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.327
I'm an old,
arthritic woman.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.563
I can't hold my arm out forever.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.331
Now take it!

30:01.033 --> 30:02.168
Can someone really do that?

30:02.201 --> 30:03.235
Never had it happen before.

30:03.269 --> 30:04.236
Well, how much is it?

30:04.270 --> 30:05.237
I didn't look.

30:05.271 --> 30:06.505
A patient writes you a check

30:06.538 --> 30:07.573
and you don't look
at the amount?

30:07.606 --> 30:08.875
Oh, my God.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.309
You accepted money
from a patient?

30:10.342 --> 30:11.377
I'll look at it.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.245
That's completely
unethical.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.480
It made her feel good

30:14.513 --> 30:16.482
to give me a token
of appreciation.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.017
So, yes, Susan,
I took it.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.152
Hello, have her send you
a basket of muffins.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.387
It'll probably
bounce anyway.

30:21.420 --> 30:23.589
Uh, it's for $10,000.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.229
Melody Cranston's
medical recs.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.198
Certainly thick enough
to support Munchausen's.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.532
Well, maybe not.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.002
Six months ago she came in
with a fractured orbit

30:36.035 --> 30:37.303
from falling off a ladder.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.938
Which is pretty
damned impossible.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.306
Yeah, well, a month
after that

30:40.339 --> 30:42.341
she was back with multiple
abrasions and contusions

30:42.374 --> 30:43.542
and a forearm fracture.

30:43.575 --> 30:47.013
Broken jaw in 2000,
broken ribs in 2001.

30:47.046 --> 30:48.647
Looks like Melody's

30:48.680 --> 30:51.150
got a lousy
boyfriend.

30:51.183 --> 30:53.485
( door unlocking )

30:53.519 --> 30:56.055
I tried to call.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.256
( door slams )

30:57.289 --> 30:58.557
What's the matter with you?

30:58.590 --> 31:00.993
He doesn't want
to do it this way.

31:01.027 --> 31:02.594
He doesn't, or you don't?

31:02.628 --> 31:04.396
Where is he?

31:04.430 --> 31:08.134
Abby, the only way someone
with this disease gets better

31:08.167 --> 31:09.468
is if they want to.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.403
Oh, what, so until then
we just wait it out?

31:11.437 --> 31:12.404
Is that it?

31:12.438 --> 31:13.605
No, I didn't
say that.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.507
Well, then what
are you saying, Mom?

31:15.541 --> 31:16.642
What's the plan here?

31:16.675 --> 31:19.245
Does he even
have one?

31:19.278 --> 31:20.679
Do you have one?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.182
We're going back
to Minnesota in the morning.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.484
What?

31:25.517 --> 31:26.452
No, you're not.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.454
Do you have any idea

31:28.487 --> 31:29.655
how many strings
I had to pull

31:29.688 --> 31:31.090
to get him into
that center?

31:31.123 --> 31:32.291
He'll live with me.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.525
I'll get him to see
my psychiatrist

31:33.559 --> 31:34.560
at least once a week.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.195
This is a proven program.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.030
I'll keep him on his meds
if I can.

31:38.064 --> 31:39.531
If you can?

31:39.565 --> 31:42.368
I realize this is hard
for you to understand.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.036
No, it's impossible, actually.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.337
I love him, too.

31:45.371 --> 31:47.006
So what?!
I know you think

31:47.039 --> 31:48.507
you're the only one
that's ever been there

31:48.540 --> 31:50.009
for either of us, and
maybe that's true...

31:50.042 --> 31:51.543
No, that is true!

31:51.577 --> 31:54.246
All right.
But Abby, I'm here now.

31:56.548 --> 31:59.351
Where is he?

31:59.385 --> 32:02.088
Afebrile, normal vitals
after two 80cc boluses.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.022
WOMAN:
What about
his glucose?

32:03.055 --> 32:04.523
The last two were fine.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.993
Slow start on the Enfamil,
but he's good now.

32:06.993 --> 32:09.228
Okay, then,
time to go, baby.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.496
Excuse me.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.331
We've both been
in here for hours

32:12.364 --> 32:14.166
and I haven't been able
to see his face.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.534
Could I?

32:15.567 --> 32:19.005
Hey, your first roommate
wants to meet you.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.706
Beautiful, isn't he?

32:20.739 --> 32:22.408
I love this age.

32:22.441 --> 32:24.510
It's when they
really need you.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.412
Okay, say bye-bye.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.314
Oh, okay.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.216
Bye-bye.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.023
You ever figure out
a name for him?

32:37.056 --> 32:39.091
Um... no.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.162
Did your
boyfriend leave?

32:43.195 --> 32:44.396
He had to get to work.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.464
Right.

32:45.497 --> 32:47.299
So, how are you feeling?

32:47.333 --> 32:49.035
About the same.

32:49.068 --> 32:50.569
Mm, I mean in general.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.704
Have you been upset

32:52.738 --> 32:54.473
or depressed?

32:54.506 --> 32:57.243
No, not really.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.510
Then why'd you take

32:58.544 --> 33:01.180
an aspirin
overdose?

33:01.213 --> 33:03.082
What was it?
Like, 20 pills?

33:03.115 --> 33:05.417
That must have been
some headache.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.486
Are you trying
to get his sympathy

33:07.519 --> 33:09.488
or are you trying
to get away from him?

33:09.521 --> 33:12.391
We both know
you've been beaten.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.061
A lot.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.695
Melody, someone is hurting you.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.331
You have to turn him in
to the police.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.700
I can't do that.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.635
I couldn't.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.672
The violence is not
going to stop on its own.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.474
I just need a few days.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.541
Look,
we both know...

33:29.575 --> 33:31.510
He's joining the Navy.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.312
Your boyfriend?

33:34.546 --> 33:37.249
My son.

33:41.087 --> 33:43.089
All right, Jerry, talk to me.
What'd I miss?

33:43.089 --> 33:44.090
Security stopped a guy

33:44.090 --> 33:45.624
with a crossbow coming in

33:45.657 --> 33:48.560
Yosh forgot to put Connie's
ice cream cake in the freezer

33:48.594 --> 33:49.761
oh, and, uh,
Carter was wondering

33:49.795 --> 33:51.130
where the hell you been.

33:51.163 --> 33:52.331
Hey, I had business
to attend to.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.532
What's he care?

33:53.565 --> 33:54.766
I signed my patients
out to Chen anyway.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.268
He asked and you asked.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.604
Hey, did you dispo
the diabetic ulcer in One?

33:58.637 --> 34:01.107
Yeah, and Mr. Barnstal
got moved up to the ICU.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.441
Perfect. Mr. Brenner
back from surgery yet?

34:02.474 --> 34:04.410
He exsanguinated
in the OR.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.577
What?

34:05.611 --> 34:07.113
Died about
an hour ago.

34:07.146 --> 34:08.179
Where's Morgan?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.149
Uh, with his mom, I think.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.850
I thought I told you
not to do anything.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.120
Well, you weren't here,
what was I supposed to do?

34:14.120 --> 34:15.786
Learn to follow
simple instructions, Harkins.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.422
I did,
per Dr. Carter.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.628
What are you doing?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.563
I can't bring him
home this way.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.665
Please, put down
the scissors. Come on.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.467
His step-father will
never accept him.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.869
You do not need to do this.

34:30.902 --> 34:33.539
It's my right.

34:33.572 --> 34:37.376
He's my little boy.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.146
I'm doing this
for him.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.681
It's the best thing.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.257
So, how often
do you get earaches?

34:52.291 --> 34:53.725
Only when it's
cold and windy.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.327
( laughs ):
And you live in
Chicago, huh?

34:55.360 --> 34:56.628
Well, blame my parents.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.530
I'd much rather have grown up
in Jamaica.

34:58.564 --> 34:59.498
Hmm.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.632
Where did you grow up?

35:00.666 --> 35:02.434
Dr. Chen?

35:02.468 --> 35:03.702
Uh, she described you.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.504
She said
she'd been here earlier.

35:05.537 --> 35:06.738
Excuse me.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.507
Hi.

35:08.540 --> 35:09.441
I changed my mind.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.676
I want my baby back.

35:10.709 --> 35:11.743
Oh.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.179
Is this the mother?

35:13.212 --> 35:14.846
Yeah. Do you want to tell me
what happened?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.748
No, I just want him back.

35:16.782 --> 35:18.450
Oh, yeah? For how long?

35:18.484 --> 35:20.419
Can you give me
the potassium level

35:20.452 --> 35:22.854
on Mr. Pinkus?

35:22.888 --> 35:24.756
Look, I was just
really scared before

35:24.790 --> 35:25.791
but I'm not anymore.

35:25.824 --> 35:26.658
What's your name?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.527
Romy.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.530
Do you think you
can really take care
of a baby, Romy?

35:31.563 --> 35:33.199
My mama will help me.

35:33.199 --> 35:34.600
You told her?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.668
No, but I'm going to.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.504
He's mine.

35:38.537 --> 35:39.705
Can I see him?

35:40.706 --> 35:42.541
Chuny?

35:42.574 --> 35:43.842
Yeah.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.577
Can you please take
Romy to see her baby?

35:45.611 --> 35:47.579
Sure. This way. You going
to call Social Services?

35:47.613 --> 35:48.614
Yeah.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.316
Mother of the year, huh?

35:50.349 --> 35:51.583
At least she's trying.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.386
She left her baby
with a bunch of strangers.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.587
How is that trying?

35:55.621 --> 35:57.389
Make sure she gets
an examination

35:57.423 --> 35:59.725
before she leaves.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.528
( alarms ring )

36:02.561 --> 36:04.263
HALEH:
V tach.

36:04.296 --> 36:06.832
Not surprising after lying
on the floor for two days.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.467
She probably got a blood clot

36:08.500 --> 36:10.669
that broke off
and went to her lungs.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.938
Happens all the time.

36:12.971 --> 36:14.840
Why didn't someone come get me?

36:14.873 --> 36:18.377
She had an advanced directive--
no heroic measures.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.514
How come I didn't know
about it?

36:22.548 --> 36:23.982
Gave it to me a
little while ago.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.317
Wanted to make sure

36:25.351 --> 36:26.352
it was out
of her purse

36:26.385 --> 36:27.453
and in her
medical record.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.521
( alarm sounds )

36:29.555 --> 36:30.822
V fib.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.858
Aren't you off yet?

36:32.891 --> 36:34.393
An hour ago.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.495
I've got this if
you want to go.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.998
You need the monitor on?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.967
Yes.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.636
Asystole.

36:44.670 --> 36:45.937
Where's the accu-check?

36:45.971 --> 36:47.273
Exam Three.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.740
Hey, you going
to bingo tonight?

36:48.774 --> 36:50.509
I can't. I need
the overtime.

36:50.542 --> 36:52.511
Blackout jackpot's
five grand.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.447
Yeah? Maybe
I should go.

36:55.481 --> 36:57.416
Sorry.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.518
Have you called it?

37:01.887 --> 37:04.290
19:28.

37:06.558 --> 37:07.526
It's Navy, huh?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.527
Yeah, what can I say?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.728
I like the water.

37:09.761 --> 37:10.962
I can't fault
you for that.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.398
LEWIS:
Jeremy?

37:12.431 --> 37:14.032
Is she ready to go?
Uh, not quite.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.867
Look like
your mother has the beginnings

37:15.901 --> 37:18.570
of a stomach ulcer, probably
from taking too much aspirin.

37:18.604 --> 37:21.006
That makes sense. She's always
complaining about headaches.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.441
Yeah. Anyway, we'll need

37:22.474 --> 37:23.975
to keep her here
for observation.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.777
For how long?

37:25.811 --> 37:27.746
Well, we need
to treat her abdominal pain

37:27.779 --> 37:29.515
keep her hydrated
on IV fluids.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.383
So, a couple of days
at least.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.584
I'm shipping out in
a couple of days.

37:32.618 --> 37:34.653
Good thing
they invented telephones, huh?

37:34.686 --> 37:37.889
Good luck.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.990
Maybe I misheard.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.626
What was your
diagnosis?

37:40.659 --> 37:41.560
Unintentional

37:41.593 --> 37:42.461
aspirin overdose.

37:42.494 --> 37:44.029
Unintentional?

37:44.062 --> 37:45.931
That's what she's telling
the social worker.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.066
And we're admitting her?

37:48.099 --> 37:50.369
( sighs )

37:50.402 --> 37:51.803
Her son knocks her around.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.440
Her son?

37:54.473 --> 37:55.341
And he leaves

37:55.374 --> 37:56.608
for good in two days

37:56.642 --> 37:58.610
and she doesn't want it
to be for jail.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.711
( sighs )

37:59.745 --> 38:01.046
So, you made up a diagnosis?

38:01.079 --> 38:02.514
No, I stretched one.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.350
Sounds unethical.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.952
So is eavesdropping.

38:11.357 --> 38:12.558
What number?

38:12.591 --> 38:13.659
309.

38:13.692 --> 38:14.960
You have a key?

38:14.993 --> 38:18.597
Yes.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.632
Eric, it's Abby.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.371
( sighs )

38:25.404 --> 38:27.573
Can you let me in?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.541
I need to talk to you.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.577
Are you alone?

38:31.610 --> 38:34.646
No. Mom's here, too.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.682
Why did you bring her?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.017
She's worried about you, Eric.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.824
I don't want you here.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.693
Okay, just hold on, all right?

38:47.726 --> 38:49.395
I don't want you
in my life right now.

38:49.395 --> 38:50.562
What?

38:50.596 --> 38:51.763
Are you coming in?

38:54.566 --> 38:55.801
Okay. Wait a minute.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.835
Eric, don't do this.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.470
Move your hand.
You need help.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.705
I don't want to hurt you.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.906
You can't do
this by yourself.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.508
You need structure
and stability.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.609
Let go.
Someone you can

39:03.642 --> 39:04.976
rely on and trust.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.878
That's not you anymore, okay?

39:08.647 --> 39:11.417
You don't understand.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.051
Yes, I do.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.053
You think you do, but you don't.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.855
You're not like us.

39:16.888 --> 39:20.091
You never will be.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.794
MAGGIE:
I'll call you
when we get settled.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.899
Don't bother.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.437
Abby...

39:31.470 --> 39:33.839
Abby?

39:40.646 --> 39:42.581
You taking off?

39:42.614 --> 39:44.683
I have to make up time.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.519
Seems like I took
too long of a break.

39:47.553 --> 39:49.755
You can't just leave.

39:49.788 --> 39:52.057
I signed out to Chen.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.693
Breaks are for ten minutes
in the hospital.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.628
You were gone for over an hour.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.866
Look, you weren't here...

40:00.899 --> 40:03.469
so I overrode your order
to Harkins

40:03.502 --> 40:05.471
but it's not like
I had much of a choice.

40:05.504 --> 40:06.572
No. You could have waited.

40:06.605 --> 40:07.939
You could have paged me.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.508
You could have
respected the kid's wishes.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.876
He's a minor.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.578
You could have called
Social Services in.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.579
To do what?

40:13.612 --> 40:15.614
Remove him from the home?

40:15.647 --> 40:18.650
Hey, I feel bad
about what happened, too

40:18.684 --> 40:21.019
but like it or not,
she's his only family.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.589
Define family.

40:58.590 --> 41:01.026
That's her.

41:03.629 --> 41:05.831
She never told me.

41:05.864 --> 41:07.933
I just thought
that she gained some weight.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.703
Thank you.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.776
LEWIS:
Oh, I so need
a margarita.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.177
Are you ready?

41:19.210 --> 41:20.712
Uh, I think I'm going to pass.

41:20.746 --> 41:21.647
Oh, come on.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.782
I hate drinking alone.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.884
I mean, I'll
do it, but...

41:25.917 --> 41:27.285
See you tomorrow?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.621
Oh!

41:33.692 --> 41:35.894
Next in line.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.300
Help you?

41:42.333 --> 41:43.902
Yeah, I need
to cash a check, please.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.103
I.D.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.939
and most recent
pay stub.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.641
You realize
there's a 20% fee

41:49.675 --> 41:51.610
for cashing a
personal check

41:51.643 --> 41:52.611
this size?

41:52.644 --> 41:54.846
Yeah, that's fine.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.582
Hundreds okay?

41:56.615 --> 41:58.650
Sure.

42:00.085 --> 42:01.987
( sighs )

42:02.020 --> 42:03.789
Hey.

42:03.822 --> 42:05.757
What's up?

42:05.791 --> 42:07.659
Be better if I
got my job back.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.729
That ain't
going to happen.

42:10.762 --> 42:11.697
You talk to him?

42:11.730 --> 42:13.765
Yeah.

42:15.634 --> 42:16.835
Find anything?

42:16.868 --> 42:18.704
Maintenance man
at an apartment building.

42:18.737 --> 42:20.639
But they want somebody
with experience.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.140
Anything else?

42:22.173 --> 42:25.911
McDonald's, but they're talking
minimum wage.

42:25.944 --> 42:28.313
Wouldn't be so bad if it was all
you can eat, though, huh, G?

42:28.346 --> 42:29.214
Hey, what's this?
X Box, G.

42:29.247 --> 42:30.315
Yeah, I can see that.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.683
What are you
doing with it?

42:31.717 --> 42:33.919
My friends heard
about me getting fired

42:33.952 --> 42:35.721
so they gave it to me.
What friends?

42:35.754 --> 42:36.822
You know, my boys.

42:36.855 --> 42:38.089
They gave it to me.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.625
They won it or something.

42:39.658 --> 42:43.762
Leon... did it come in a box?

42:58.409 --> 43:00.345
Every once in a while

43:00.378 --> 43:04.783
you'll have a really
perfect cigarette

43:04.816 --> 43:07.653
you know?

43:07.653 --> 43:09.387
Everything about it is perfect--

43:09.420 --> 43:10.922
the taste, the moment.

43:10.956 --> 43:12.991
Of course, 99% of the time,
it tastes like crap.

43:13.024 --> 43:15.026
It causes cancer.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.161
That, too.

43:16.194 --> 43:17.395
I left you a message.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.664
How did it go?

43:18.664 --> 43:21.399
With what?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.835
With your brother.

43:25.871 --> 43:27.839
Are you going
to let me in

43:27.873 --> 43:29.941
or do I have to
guess, or... ?

43:29.975 --> 43:32.711
Nothing happened.

43:32.744 --> 43:34.145
Nothing.

43:36.114 --> 43:39.718
Come on.

43:39.751 --> 43:42.854
Despite the best laid plans,
nothing happened.

43:42.888 --> 43:45.090
Mostly because they left.

43:45.123 --> 43:47.192
What?

43:47.225 --> 43:48.359
They went off
into the sunset together.

43:48.393 --> 43:49.928
It was very romantic.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.730
Wait, your mom and
Eric-- they're gone?

43:51.763 --> 43:54.365
You know... I don't really want
to talk about this right now

43:54.399 --> 43:59.204

my perfect smoke.

43:59.237 --> 44:04.776
I'm sorry.

44:04.810 --> 44:08.413
It's okay. I'm done.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.415
I'm done with the both of them.

44:10.448 --> 44:15.721
I'm done with all of it.

44:15.721 --> 44:18.089
Cancel Christmas.
