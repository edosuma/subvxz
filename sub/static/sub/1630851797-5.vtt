Uh, come on--come on in.

welcome to my crib, or, uh--

Everything okay?

God, there's no easy way
to say it,

Um, I didn't want to
tell you over the phone.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.003

21:13.672 --> 21:15.107
- Yeah, it is, I know.

21:15.173 --> 21:18.410
I didn't think it could
happen at my age.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.178
- Yeah, me either.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.081
- Um, my doctor
called it a miracle.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.249
- Yeah.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.086
- Can I sit down?
- Yes, please.

21:28.153 --> 21:31.123
Yeah, sorry.
- That's okay.

21:33.425 --> 21:36.428
It's a little stressful
because there are

21:36.495 --> 21:39.531
complications at my age.
- Of course.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.500
- I mean,
I've done it twice before,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.869
so I'll just--
I'll figure it out.

21:43.969 --> 21:47.606
- Yeah, I mean, well, you know,
whatever you wanna do, like--

21:47.673 --> 21:49.107
I mean, I'll--
I'm more than happy--

21:49.174 --> 21:52.344
- Thank you.
Yeah, to, like, come with you.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.013
And obviously, I'll pay
for anything that you--

21:55.113 --> 21:58.717
- Oh, no, Marcus,
I'm keeping the baby.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.790
But I don't need
anything from you, I'm set.

22:06.858 --> 22:11.330
- Uh, um--uh, oh, God.

22:11.396 --> 22:14.333
Oh, my God, how could
I let this fuckin' happen?

22:14.399 --> 22:17.402
- I'm totally fine
with you being involved

22:17.502 --> 22:20.339
as much or as little
as you want.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.141
It's really, I mean,
it's not that complicated.

22:23.208 --> 22:25.177
- Well, I mean, it is.

22:25.243 --> 22:26.578
For me, it is
kinda complicated.

22:26.678 --> 22:27.913
- Why?

22:28.013 --> 22:31.183
- Okay, Becca,
you can't tell a Black man

22:31.249 --> 22:36.321
that he doesn't have to be
involved with his kid.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.757
- Okay, well,
that seems ridiculous.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.826
What does race
have to do with anything?

22:40.892 --> 22:41.993
- 'Cause people
are gonna judge me

22:42.060 --> 22:43.762
differently than they do you.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.665
Like, that's just--
that's just facts, so--

22:46.732 --> 22:49.668
- Neither one of us
wanted this to happen.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.870
It's gonna be okay.

22:51.937 --> 22:54.272
I mean, come on, Marcus.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.408
It's gonna be
a little mixed baby.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.176
Mixed babies are so cute.

22:58.243 --> 22:59.778
- You know, I don't--
- Better be cute.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.413
- No, no, no,
I don't think that's--

23:01.513 --> 23:03.415
I don't think
that's funny, like--

23:03.515 --> 23:04.783
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna say it.

23:04.883 --> 23:05.951
I mean, like,
is that the reason

23:06.051 --> 23:07.386
why you wanna keep this baby?

23:07.452 --> 23:09.020
Do you want, like,
this trendy little,

23:09.087 --> 23:11.690

frizzy haired accessory

23:11.757 --> 23:13.525

walk around town with?

street cred,

23:18.930 --> 23:20.866
like, just fuckin' cemented.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.802
I mean, like, is that--
is that what this is about?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.438
- Fuck you,
that's not what I meant.

23:26.538 --> 23:28.473
I didn't even
have to tell you, Marcus.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.975
I did you a courtesy.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.443
But you do not get a say

23:31.543 --> 23:33.378
in what I do with my body.

23:33.445 --> 23:36.381
- It's your body, but half
of what's happening in there,

23:36.448 --> 23:37.816
that's--that's me.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.151
And I don't get
any say in that?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.119
Like, none?

23:41.219 --> 23:43.422
Come on, Becca, that's
fucked up, man, you know it.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.557
Like, this isn't
supposed to be a thing.

23:45.624 --> 23:48.660
Like, I don't wanna be tied
to you for the rest of my life.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.429
- What do you want?
I'm giving you an out.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.330
- No, I don't--
I don't want an out.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.000
- Then what do you want,
Marcus?
