01:47.880 --> 01:49.780
Take it!

01:59.390 --> 02:02.690
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.390
Hey, Aron. Sonja here, again.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.940
I know that you're probably
gonna be away this weekend.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.440
But listen, just think about
what we're gonna play. Please.

02:12.510 --> 02:15.640
'Cause we have to decide, and we really...
We need to practice, okay?

02:15.710 --> 02:17.970
Anyway, it will be fun. I promise.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.780
And, oh, please call Mom. Please.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.510
'Cause she worries, which you know already.

02:22.580 --> 02:24.810
Okay. Later, A. Bye.

03:55.980 --> 03:57.470
Whoa!

04:11.790 --> 04:14.130
Hey! It's Friday night.

04:15.260 --> 04:17.730
April 25, 2003.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.430
I'm just entering Canyon-lands.

04:21.500 --> 04:25.170
Just me,
the music and the night.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.300
Love it!

05:19.260 --> 05:21.250
Whoo!

05:53.730 --> 05:55.750
Blue John Canyon.

05:55.830 --> 05:59.990
Guidebook says four and a half hours
to the big-drop rappel.

06:00.070 --> 06:02.000
I aim to take 45 minutes off that.

06:18.350 --> 06:19.220
Whoo!

08:03.220 --> 08:05.350
Your face.

08:05.430 --> 08:10.390
- You looked like a dog.
- I wish I was hiking with anyone else.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.500
I don't know.
I think we go that way.

08:18.570 --> 08:20.560
But we went that
way and had to come back.

08:20.640 --> 08:22.370
- Hey!
- Whoa.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.900
You're doing Blue John too, huh?

08:25.980 --> 08:29.140
Uh, no, actually. We're headed for the dome.

08:29.220 --> 08:30.680
- But I think we're lost.
- She's lost.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.240
Hang on.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.210
- Oh, my God.
- God.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.890
Let's see this.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.830
You are... here.

08:43.900 --> 08:45.630
- We are?
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.700 --> 08:48.360
Oh, yeah. I knew that. I knew that.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.770
And the dome is there.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.140
Oh.

08:54.210 --> 08:56.700
Um, I can take you that way if you like.

08:58.210 --> 08:59.370
Uh...

08:59.450 --> 09:02.310
I'm sorry. The, uh- Friday the 13th there.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.710
Child-killer look.

09:05.550 --> 09:07.040
I'm only a psychopath on weekdays.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.110
And today's Saturday, so...

09:11.490 --> 09:13.980
Can't take this off. It's my face.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.620
Nice.

09:18.130 --> 09:20.330
- Aron.
- Kristi.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.870
Allow me to introduce
you to my friend Megan.

09:23.910 --> 09:25.770
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.400
What do you say?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.500
You're lost. I'm a guide.

09:31.410 --> 09:32.900
I'm good.

09:34.950 --> 09:36.440
- Why not?
- Sure.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.040
All right. This way.

09:40.190 --> 09:41.710
You biked from Horseshoe, huh?

09:41.790 --> 09:44.590
What is that- like, 20 miles?

09:44.660 --> 09:46.790
Seventeen on the odometer.

09:46.860 --> 09:49.160
Oh. Oh. I thought it was 17.2.

09:49.230 --> 09:52.720
Uh, 17.3 actually.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.930
Ah, you're one of those.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.330
I'm not one of those.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.630
Do you spend a lot of time out here?

09:58.710 --> 10:00.800
It's my second home.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.280
Ah, see?

10:03.340 --> 10:05.210
There's the fork right there.

10:05.280 --> 10:07.410
Aah. Okay, totally missed that.

10:07.480 --> 10:09.640
- Glad we bumped into you.
- Yeah.

10:09.720 --> 10:11.810
What are the odds,
considering we're all the way out here?

10:11.890 --> 10:14.380
Exactly. You go to the
one place in America...

10:14.460 --> 10:17.120
you're pretty much guaranteed
not to run into a weirdo...

10:17.190 --> 10:19.820
And what happens?

10:19.890 --> 10:22.060
All right.

10:22.130 --> 10:26.160
So the guidebook says
that the route's through here.

10:26.230 --> 10:30.470
But I know a better way- the cool way.

10:32.510 --> 10:36.270
Guaranteed best time you can have
with your clothes on.

10:36.340 --> 10:39.280
Although it's better with your clothes off.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.040
It is a bit of a climb.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.020
We climb.

10:44.090 --> 10:47.060
- And a bit of a squeeze.
- We squeeze.

10:51.030 --> 10:54.220
So you get us all
the way back in here...

10:54.300 --> 10:57.130
and then you tell us that
you are not a guide.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.000
Well, no. I'm an engineer.
But this is what I really want to do.

11:01.070 --> 11:03.200
Oh, that's wonderful.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.070
I've always wanted to be a supermodel...

11:05.140 --> 11:08.910
but I don't think that's actually
really gonna work out, you know?

11:08.980 --> 11:11.100
Jesus, what if these things move?

11:11.180 --> 11:13.740
They've been here for millions of years.
They're not gonna move.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.310
- Oh, sure they will.
- What?

11:16.380 --> 11:19.080
- Yeah. Everything's moving all the time.
- Oh!

11:19.150 --> 11:20.810
Let's just hope not today.

11:20.890 --> 11:22.650
Oh. Great.

11:26.530 --> 11:27.890
All right.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.830
Now all you gotta remember
is that everything will be okay.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.530
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

11:37.440 --> 11:39.430
- What...
- Where- Aron!

11:39.510 --> 11:41.200
Are you okay? Aron!

11:41.280 --> 11:42.260
Aron!

11:58.630 --> 12:02.030
- Listen to the guy. He's fine.
- Yeah.

12:03.560 --> 12:04.620
He's batshit.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.670
You're batshit!

12:08.170 --> 12:10.570
Come on! You gotta come down here!

12:10.640 --> 12:12.730
- Trust me!
- Trust you?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.600
I'll kill you, Aron Ralston!

12:14.680 --> 12:17.200
Oh, please. You love this.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.380
Whoa!

12:31.360 --> 12:32.420
Whoo!

12:32.490 --> 12:34.590
Hey!

12:34.660 --> 12:36.130
- Nice job!
- Oh, my God!

12:36.200 --> 12:38.830
- Megan! You're missing it!
- Come on!

12:38.900 --> 12:40.060
It's amazing!

12:40.130 --> 12:41.570
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Just jump!

12:41.640 --> 12:43.470
- Oh, my God. Fuck.
- Just jump, Megan!

12:43.540 --> 12:44.770
Fuck.

12:45.740 --> 12:47.570
Oh, shit!

12:52.480 --> 12:53.970
Are you okay?

12:54.050 --> 12:55.540
- Nice jump.
- Oh, my God.

12:55.620 --> 12:56.980
I can't believe I just did that.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.980
- That's why we have to do it again.
- Again? Again?

13:01.060 --> 13:03.620
- Camera! Camera!
- Camera? Camera!

13:03.690 --> 13:05.680
Camera!

13:06.460 --> 13:08.990
Whoo!

13:20.510 --> 13:25.780
So, Blue John is actually named
after this guy, Blue John...

13:25.850 --> 13:28.710
who was Butch Cassidy's cook...

13:28.780 --> 13:30.880
- Ah. That's cool.
- from, you know, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

13:30.950 --> 13:32.610
- The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.
- Yeah.

13:32.690 --> 13:35.990
And they would hide out
in these canyons, I guess.

13:36.060 --> 13:39.650
But also what they'd do is they'd run horses...
wild horses- into here...

13:39.730 --> 13:42.250
- and they'd trap 'em at the end of the canyons.
- Wow.

13:42.330 --> 13:44.630
- That's how they'd catch the horses.
- Oh, wow.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.430
You wanna take one more picture before I go?

13:46.500 --> 13:47.990
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.400
Ready?

13:50.740 --> 13:53.070
One, two, three.

13:53.140 --> 13:55.270
Blue John. Blue Cheese.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.330
Well, will I ever see you again?

13:57.410 --> 13:59.680
That depends. Do you party?

13:59.750 --> 14:02.980
Do I party? Uh, yeah, sometimes.

14:03.050 --> 14:06.350
Tomorrow night, we're actually, seriously,
throwing a party, if you wanna come.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.580
Yeah. You should come by,
have a beer, kick back.

14:08.660 --> 14:10.250
Okay. Where am I going?

14:10.320 --> 14:12.050
It's about 20 miles away, near Green River.

14:12.130 --> 14:14.390
You know the old motel? It's behind that.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.930
There's gonna be a huge
inflatable Scooby-Doo.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.520
- You can't miss it.
- Really? Okay.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.460
- Yep. ...
Cool. - Okay.

14:20.540 --> 14:23.030
It was good to meet you. See ya!

14:23.100 --> 14:25.270
Bye! Scooby-Doo!

14:25.340 --> 14:27.310
Yeah!

14:27.380 --> 14:28.870
Rock on!

14:32.650 --> 14:34.510
You think he's actually gonna show up?

14:34.580 --> 14:38.950
I don't think we figured in his day at all.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.180
Oh.

14:40.250 --> 14:43.260
You liked him.

16:21.620 --> 16:23.850
Shit!

18:27.210 --> 18:28.940
This is insane!

18:47.200 --> 18:48.930
Fuck.

18:53.370 --> 18:55.970
Move this fucking rock!

19:09.090 --> 19:09.890
Please.

19:18.030 --> 19:19.520
Fuck.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.790
Fucking save it.

19:50.870 --> 19:51.850
Oh, God.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.610
Kristi!

20:14.260 --> 20:15.920
Megan!

20:16.420 --> 20:18.480
Kristi!

20:18.560 --> 20:21.260
It's Aron!

20:21.330 --> 20:23.300
Megan!

20:24.700 --> 20:27.000
Kristi! Megan!

20:28.170 --> 20:30.160
Kristi!

20:48.820 --> 20:50.590
Think.

20:53.090 --> 20:54.580
Just think.

21:14.350 --> 21:15.510
Ow!

21:52.350 --> 21:54.220
Hmm.

22:36.430 --> 22:37.920
Yeah.

22:50.340 --> 22:51.830
Fuck.

23:07.700 --> 23:10.360
Oh. Fuck.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.390
Shit.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.260
Oh, God.

23:16.340 --> 23:17.460
Shit!

23:18.510 --> 23:20.410
Fucker.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.280
Come on. Please.

24:39.720 --> 24:41.450
Sweet.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.820
Ah.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.190
Oh.

24:59.110 --> 25:00.870
Nice and dull.

27:22.250 --> 27:24.180
Look at the size of this one, man.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.240
Like, how the fuck did this get here?

28:19.770 --> 28:21.260
Yes.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.710
Okay.

30:14.990 --> 30:16.680
Hey!

31:33.400 --> 31:34.890
Hey, buddy.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.160
Here we go.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.450
Um.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.810
It's 3:05...

32:26.890 --> 32:32.290
on Sunday, April 27, 2003.

32:33.230 --> 32:36.890
Uh, this marks 24 hours...

32:36.960 --> 32:41.160
of being stuck in Blue John Canyon...

32:42.270 --> 32:45.800
right where it slots up before the big drop.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.000
My name's Aron Ralston.

32:50.080 --> 32:54.340
My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
of Englewood, Colorado.

32:55.550 --> 32:57.710
Um.

32:57.780 --> 33:01.350
Whoever finds this can keep the- the recorder.

33:01.420 --> 33:04.720
Just please try
and get in touch with my parents...

33:04.790 --> 33:07.660
and-and give them this tape.

33:07.730 --> 33:09.290
I'd appreciate it.

33:10.330 --> 33:16.100
Uh, I was descending Blue John yesterday...

33:16.170 --> 33:22.510
uh, when this, uh, chockstone came loose...

33:22.580 --> 33:24.130
and rolled onto my arm...

33:24.210 --> 33:27.040
and now it's stuck.

33:27.110 --> 33:32.920
Um, the thumb is kind
of this gray-blue color.

33:33.750 --> 33:35.280
Yeah.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.950
It's been without circulation for 24 hours.

33:39.930 --> 33:43.190
So, I think it's pretty well gone.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.360
I'm low on food.

33:47.430 --> 33:48.830
Um.

33:49.970 --> 33:53.740
That's about 300, 400 mil...

33:54.970 --> 33:56.910
and that's it for water.

34:01.480 --> 34:04.850
I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.219
Hello!

34:11.290 --> 34:12.449
Please!

34:12.530 --> 34:14.620
There's someone down here!

34:14.690 --> 34:16.860
Help!

34:16.929 --> 34:18.920
I'm in the canyon!

34:20.030 --> 34:25.630
Help!

34:25.710 --> 34:29.370
Help! Help!

34:58.140 --> 34:59.660
Please!

34:59.740 --> 35:01.070
Help!

35:02.910 --> 35:04.070
Help!

35:05.110 --> 35:07.340
Down here!

35:07.410 --> 35:08.810
Help!

35:22.530 --> 35:24.260
Don't lose it.

35:30.270 --> 35:31.830
Aron.

35:34.910 --> 35:37.140
Do not lose it.

36:29.100 --> 36:30.590
Not bad.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.570
Oh, dinner.

36:52.420 --> 36:55.180
Tomorrow night, we're actually,
seriously, throwing a party.

36:55.260 --> 36:57.380
You should come by, have a beer, kick back.

36:57.460 --> 37:00.050
There's gonna be
a huge inflatable Scooby-Doo.

37:00.130 --> 37:03.030
Scooby-Doo.

37:24.320 --> 37:26.910
Hmm. Mountain Dew.

37:30.320 --> 37:31.380
Plastic cup.

37:33.790 --> 37:35.090
Thank you.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.530
Oh.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.930
Might take a beer as well.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.570
Don't mind if I do.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.380
Oh.

38:45.060 --> 38:48.190
Hey. Aron here. Leave a message.

38:52.110 --> 38:56.060
Aron, it's Mom. I was hoping to catch you.

38:56.780 --> 38:59.040
Are you there?

38:59.110 --> 39:00.880
Hello?

39:02.020 --> 39:04.310
Okay. Nothing urgent.

39:06.090 --> 39:08.750
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

39:09.860 --> 39:13.380
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

39:31.610 --> 39:34.510
- Where you going?
- Don't know yet.

39:34.580 --> 39:36.610
Right there, Brion.

39:36.680 --> 39:39.520
Maybe Utah. Maybe somewhere else.

39:39.590 --> 39:40.950
Have a good one.

39:41.020 --> 39:42.180
Always do.

39:42.260 --> 39:44.050
Always do.

40:11.550 --> 40:12.690
Let's go.

40:53.590 --> 40:54.920
Oh, come on!

42:28.290 --> 42:29.620
Crap.

42:42.700 --> 42:45.190
This is freaking me out, looking at myself.

42:46.140 --> 42:49.160
Sorry. I hope that's okay.

42:49.240 --> 42:50.370
Uh.

42:52.710 --> 42:55.040
It's Monday. Um.

42:56.850 --> 42:58.710
Bummer, all day.

42:59.790 --> 43:02.450
I tried to set up this pulley all morning...

43:02.520 --> 43:04.080
but it didn't work.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.090
It was worth a try.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.920
But there's too much friction.

43:09.000 --> 43:13.230
And it's a climbing rope,
so there's too much stretch.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.090
What I could really use...

43:16.170 --> 43:21.040
is about 20 meters of
static wrap rope, 9.8 mil.

43:22.680 --> 43:24.300
Uh, three or four pulleys...

43:24.380 --> 43:26.810
a rack of carabiners, a sling...

43:26.880 --> 43:30.320
power drill... and bolt kit.

43:32.450 --> 43:36.680
Oh, and, uh, eight burly men
to do all the hauling.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.130
That should just about do it.

43:44.630 --> 43:46.120
I have, uh...

43:48.270 --> 43:51.030
about 150 milliliters of water left...

43:53.110 --> 43:57.340
which should keep me alive
till tomorrow night...

43:58.780 --> 44:00.440
if I'm lucky.

44:00.510 --> 44:02.240
I peed twice.

44:03.380 --> 44:06.720
Almost pissed my pants.

44:06.790 --> 44:10.980
Uh, I don't know,
my body's acting really weird.

44:12.430 --> 44:16.230
The second time, I did it in the CamelBak.

44:19.970 --> 44:22.300
Smells really bad.

44:22.370 --> 44:25.500
But, uh, I'm sure it'll settle.

44:28.510 --> 44:31.480
It's got to be chilled like sauvignon blanc.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.210
No number twos.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.650
Which should disappoint my insect friends.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.150
They'll just have to wait.

44:43.220 --> 44:45.660
Let's see, what else could I tell you?

44:45.730 --> 44:47.520
Um...

44:49.230 --> 44:52.760
There's this raven that comes every morning.

44:56.500 --> 44:57.940
Hey.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.530
I clocked it at 8:17.

45:03.510 --> 45:05.530
I'll- I'll film it for you tomorrow.

45:05.610 --> 45:09.340
Every morning at, uh, 9:30...

45:10.850 --> 45:13.910
I get 15 minutes of sunlight.

45:13.990 --> 45:15.510
It's really nice.

45:20.090 --> 45:22.560
I have been chipping away.

45:22.630 --> 45:26.430
More to- More to keep warm than anything.

45:28.530 --> 45:32.970
I'm beginning to think
that my hand is supporting the rock.

45:33.040 --> 45:35.130
So when I chip away a little bit...

45:35.210 --> 45:37.300
it actually settles more.

45:41.380 --> 45:42.710
So...

45:45.380 --> 45:47.380
I found this great tourniquet.

46:17.850 --> 46:18.910
Oh.

46:20.390 --> 46:23.950
Oh, yeah.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.230
It hasn't been very useful.

47:16.410 --> 47:17.740
Lesson:

47:17.810 --> 47:22.980
Don't buy the cheap,
made-in-China multi-tool.

47:24.050 --> 47:26.540
I tried to find my Swiss Army knife, but...

47:26.620 --> 47:29.520
This thing came free with a flashlight.

47:29.590 --> 47:32.580
The flashlight was a piece of shit too.

47:32.660 --> 47:35.220
I kept it in my truck for emergencies.

47:36.330 --> 47:38.820
Not that I'm blaming you, Mom.

47:39.930 --> 47:44.600
It was a perfectly great stocking stuffer.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.210
And there's no way
you could have ever known...

47:50.280 --> 47:53.110
that I'd get in this kind of trouble.

47:53.180 --> 47:55.770
When we watch this later,
will the camera have to be on?

47:55.850 --> 47:58.510
Yeah. So you have to
leave the camera with us...

47:58.580 --> 48:00.880
if we want to watch something
that you've made, right?

48:00.950 --> 48:02.680
- Yeah.
- Good job, honey.

48:02.760 --> 48:06.190
- Isn't that great?
- That is quite extraordinary.

48:06.260 --> 48:09.160
- So he's filming her now.
- Sounds beautiful, sweetheart.

48:09.230 --> 48:11.790
- Yes.
- We're seeing it now live...

48:11.860 --> 48:14.700
but he's going to be
able to show this again.

48:17.170 --> 48:19.000
Go away.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.510
To be able to watch it.
We can't just watch it with a...

48:25.910 --> 48:27.810
So good.

48:29.010 --> 48:31.510
Well done. Okay.

48:35.320 --> 48:37.550
Way to go, Sis.

48:37.620 --> 48:40.180
- Keep playing?
- Yes, honey. Keep going.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.710
Fuck.

50:03.610 --> 50:05.670
Okay!

50:05.740 --> 50:06.900
Go!

50:17.590 --> 50:19.060
Whoo!

50:28.130 --> 50:30.400
I love you.

51:08.870 --> 51:10.360
So...

51:12.440 --> 51:14.440
how do I get in?

51:17.550 --> 51:19.210
What's the, um...

51:23.990 --> 51:25.550
- You know?
- Combination.

51:25.620 --> 51:26.820
Combination.

51:29.760 --> 51:31.990
If I told you...

51:33.600 --> 51:35.620
I'd have to kill you.

51:36.700 --> 51:38.690
But already you kill me.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.670
Combination?

51:55.790 --> 51:57.760
I think I have it.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.660
Fuck!

52:20.880 --> 52:22.370
Ah, fuck.

52:29.390 --> 52:32.220
Ah. Ah.

52:59.890 --> 53:02.980
Fuck. Fuck.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.260
Who's there?

55:06.780 --> 55:08.110
Aron?

55:40.450 --> 55:42.740
Please!

55:43.780 --> 55:45.910
Please!

55:55.290 --> 56:00.630
Please!

56:08.370 --> 56:11.900
Good morning, everybody out there. Steve.

56:11.980 --> 56:14.470
- Good morning. 
- It's The Morning Show 
with Brian Stephenson...

56:14.550 --> 56:16.140
Also coming up this half hour..

56:16.210 --> 56:19.050
Good morning. This will
get you going today. 90 for your high...

56:20.950 --> 56:23.010
Good morning, everyone!

56:23.090 --> 56:28.390
It is 7:00 here in Canyonland, U.S.A.

56:28.460 --> 56:31.190
And this morning on the boulder...

56:31.260 --> 56:33.890
we have a very special guest...

56:33.970 --> 56:38.560
self-proclaimed American superhero...

56:38.640 --> 56:41.070
Aron Ralston!

56:41.140 --> 56:44.700
Let's hear it for Aron!

56:44.780 --> 56:46.000
Hey.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.070
Hi. Oh, gosh. It's...

56:48.150 --> 56:51.600
It's a real pleasure to be here.
Thank you. Thank you.

56:51.680 --> 56:55.640
Um- Hey, can I say hi to my mom and dad?

56:55.720 --> 56:57.850
Mom and Dad!

56:57.920 --> 57:00.150
Mustn't forget Mom and Dad. Right, Aron?

57:00.230 --> 57:02.280
Yeah. That's right.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.330
Uh- Hey, Mom.

57:04.400 --> 57:06.230
I'm really sorry I...

57:06.300 --> 57:08.990
I didn't answer the phone the other night.

57:09.070 --> 57:13.660
If I had, I would have told you
where I was going, and then...

57:13.740 --> 57:15.730
Well, I probably wouldn't be here right now.

57:15.810 --> 57:17.570
That's for sure!

57:17.640 --> 57:20.300
But like I always say...

57:20.380 --> 57:23.140
your supreme selfishness...

57:23.220 --> 57:25.240
is our gain.

57:25.320 --> 57:27.680
Thank you, Aron.
Anyone else you'd like to say hi to?

57:27.750 --> 57:30.590
Um- Well, Brion at work.

57:30.660 --> 57:32.320
- Hi, Aron!
- Hey.

57:32.390 --> 57:35.360
Uh, I probably won't be
making it into work today.

57:37.500 --> 57:40.090
Get a load of this guy! Oh, wait. Hold on.

57:40.170 --> 57:46.000
We've got a question coming in
from another Aron...

57:46.070 --> 57:49.510
in Loser Canyon, Utah.

57:49.570 --> 57:51.040
Aron asks...

57:51.110 --> 57:53.340
Am I right in thinking...

57:53.410 --> 57:56.540
that even if Brion from work...

57:56.620 --> 57:58.210
notifies the police...

57:58.280 --> 58:00.550
they'll put a 24-hour hold on it...

58:00.620 --> 58:03.880
before they file a Missing Persons report?

58:03.960 --> 58:08.090
Which means you won't become
officially missing...

58:08.160 --> 58:12.290
until midday Wednesday, at the earliest!

58:12.360 --> 58:15.630
Ah, yeah.
You're right on the money there, Aron.

58:16.840 --> 58:20.570
Which means I'll probably be dead by then.

58:20.640 --> 58:24.340
Aron from Loser Canyon, Utah. How do you know so much?

58:24.410 --> 58:27.970
Well, I'll tell you how I know so much.

58:28.050 --> 58:30.040
I volunteer for the rescue service.

58:30.120 --> 58:32.050
Hmm?

58:32.120 --> 58:34.950
You see, I'm something of a, uh...

58:35.020 --> 58:37.450
well, a big fucking hard hero.

58:38.620 --> 58:42.530
And I can do everything on my own, you see?

58:42.590 --> 58:45.190
I do see.

58:45.260 --> 58:47.420
Now...

58:47.500 --> 58:51.900
is it true that despite...

58:51.970 --> 58:56.500
or maybe because
you're a big fucking hard hero...

58:56.580 --> 58:59.870
you didn't tell anyone where you were going?

58:59.950 --> 59:02.040
Uh...

59:02.110 --> 59:04.100
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

59:07.890 --> 59:10.250
- Anyone?
- Anyone.

59:13.530 --> 59:16.520
Oops!

59:19.830 --> 59:21.490
Oops.

59:29.980 --> 59:31.470
Oops.

59:41.350 --> 59:42.910
Mom, Dad.

59:46.060 --> 59:48.390
I just want to take this time to tell you...

59:48.460 --> 59:52.120
that the times we've spent together
have been awesome.

59:54.130 --> 59:56.430
And I haven't appreciated you in my heart...

59:56.500 --> 59:58.490
as I know that I could.

01:00:00.210 --> 01:00:03.610
Mom, I love you...

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.240
and I wish that I'd returned
all your calls, ever.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:14.180
I love you guys...

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.190
and I'll always be with you.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.460
Yeah.

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.780
Oh.

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:17.580
Ah.

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:01.890
Bone.

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:17.700
It's no Slurpee.

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:19.970
It's like a bag of piss.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.450
- Yahoo!
- Nice!

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.100
Come on, Ralston!

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.670
Okay, I'm gonna go up again.

01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:00.680
Give me that.

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:02.910
Quick, while he's gone.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.810
- Listen.
- We could tell him.

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:06.610
- I know that.
- Okay? Tell him.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.150
- We're very worried about you.
- 

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.190
- We're worried...
- About your music.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:13.120
Your musical choices are really rough.

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:16.160
If you keep singing Phish,
you're never gonna get a girlfriend.

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:18.590
- Never.
- You might have one, but I really doubt that you do.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.500
- You may be sort of cute, occasionally.
- I'm nervous and scared for you.

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:24.430
- Okay. This cannonball's for you.
- No one will care.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.230
Okay.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.110
That was a 10.

01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.670
All right.

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.440
I'm going to test your theory...

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.850
about whether or not it's better to do it...

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:42.220
Oh, God!

01:04:42.290 --> 01:04:44.810
without your clothes on.

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:46.880
I'm just gonna swim for a bit.

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:11.310
Don't.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.750
No, no. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:15.480
Oh, please.

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:19.190
Don't.

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.890
Don't.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.090
Ralston, rock on.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.650
Whoo!

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.970
Oh, fuck.

01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:21.570
You don't even
want me here, do you?

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:26.540
I'm gonna go, Aron.

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:31.480
Is that what you want?

01:07:34.730 --> 01:07:37.350
It is, isn't it?

01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.860
Okay.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.330
Come back.

01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:52.400
You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:14.000
Forty-six, 47, 48, 49, 50!

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:16.500
You hear that, Aron? I'm coming!

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:21.470
Um, I'm holding on.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.109
Time's moving really slowly.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:30.149
My heart's beating really fast.

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.939
I swear to God, it feels like...

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.250
- It feels like- - It's beating, like,
three times as fast as it should be.

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:43.920
So cold.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.649
So cold.

01:08:48.770 --> 01:08:50.670
Oh.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.290
Hey.

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.770
Blue John.

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:03.300
I... love... you.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.040
There you are.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:09.479
Rana. I've been thinking about you, girl.

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:11.450
I've been thinking about you, girl.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.180
I admit it. I admit it.

01:09:17.399 --> 01:09:19.920
I know how I am. I tried to do everything.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.189
- Where I was.
- I tried.

01:09:22.270 --> 01:09:24.000
Aron? Where are you?

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:26.000
Where are you?

01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:40.310
What are you guys doing here?

01:09:41.020 --> 01:09:43.420
Eddie? Tom?

01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:46.220
Hey, you guys. What's going on?

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.890
Eric? Hey.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.859
You look like the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.030
Dorks.

01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:04.260
Found you, Aron.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.310
Sis, I'm sorry that I won't be at your wedding.

01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:20.090
I know that I promised to play,
that we'd play.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.750
I'm sorry.

01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.600
I know it'll be a good one.

01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:28.900
8:15. There's no raven.

01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:31.300
8:20.

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.200
8:30. My raven didn't come.

01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:39.570
I've been thinking.

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.570
Everything is...

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.710
- It just comes together.
- You're gonna be so lonely, Aron.

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:48.950
- Have a good one.
- Always do.

01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:50.250
Laters!

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:53.150
- It's me.
- Aron, it's Mom.

01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.590
- I was hoping to catch you.
- I chose this.

01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:57.920
Dad's in New York,
so it'll be a quiet weekend.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.220
I chose all of this.

01:10:59.300 --> 01:11:02.560
Call me, okay? Lots of love.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.430
This rock.

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:10.560
This rock has been waiting for me
my entire life.

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.630
I hate this rock!

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:17.780
- In its entire life...
- ever since it was...

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:20.210
a bit of meteorite...

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.950
a million billion years ago...

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.680
How the fuck did this get here?

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.240
up there in space...

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.150
it's been waiting...

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.590
to come here...

01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:32.860
right- right here.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.360
I've been moving towards it my whole life.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.100
The minute I was born,
every breath I've taken...

01:11:42.170 --> 01:11:43.540
every action...

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:46.770
has been leading me to this crack...

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.010
on the earth's surface.

01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:34.510
Oh!

01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:43.280
Oh.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:57.500
Oh. Oh.

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:05.530
Okay. Come on.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.670
Don't pass out.

01:18:03.820 --> 01:18:04.980
Don't fall asleep.

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:44.640
Thank you.

01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:55.080
Easy.

01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:03.350
Easy. Come on.

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:00.550
Oh!

01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:29.430
Help!

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.970
Please!

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.940
Help me!

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:44.810
I need help!

01:25:57.330 --> 01:26:00.590
My name is Aron Ral- Aron Ralston.

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.860
This Saturday I was trapped by a boulder.

01:26:02.930 --> 01:26:05.990
I haven't had food or water for five days.

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:07.560
This morning I cut my arm...

01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.440
This morning I cut my arm off.

01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:14.540
Please. Some water?

01:26:17.150 --> 01:26:18.810
Thank you.

01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.890
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, but no signal.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.760
You should stop and rest.

01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:35.990
No. I've gotta keep going.

01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:39.170
Can one of you run?

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.570
Can one of you run ahead?

01:26:42.305 --> 01:26:48.293
