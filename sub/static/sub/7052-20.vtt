WEBVTT

00:07.321 --> 00:09.826
G.S.W, left-upper quadrant,
possible hemothorax.

00:09.877 --> 00:12.372
BP is dropping 80 over 50.
Pulse 120.

00:12.418 --> 00:13.139
Breath sounds?

00:13.190 --> 00:14.886
Decreased on the left side,
labored but stable.

00:15.120 --> 00:15.961
Get me
a chest scan.

00:16.003 --> 00:16.823
Doctor...

00:17.381 --> 00:18.394
There's something else.

00:24.902 --> 00:26.533
Sir, I just heard
about Nina Sharp.

00:26.564 --> 00:27.781
Do we know
who shot her?

00:27.822 --> 00:28.829
Trying to
figure that out.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.769
The security guard and doorman
in the lobby are dead.

00:30.810 --> 00:31.681
No I.D.
on the gunman.

00:31.716 --> 00:33.423
- Well, is she gonna be--
- Too early to say.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.247
Sir.

00:34.496 --> 00:36.189
No official statement
from Massive Dynamic,

00:36.230 --> 00:37.736
- or William Bell.
- Thanks.

00:38.255 --> 00:39.420
That's no surprise.

00:39.608 --> 00:41.989
If they say the C.O.O. was shot,
their stock will take a hit.

00:42.158 --> 00:44.616
Hey Liv,
security footage just came in.

00:46.378 --> 00:49.015
We had video tech assemble
the three video cameras.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.031
They shoot
the night guy...

00:51.994 --> 00:53.080
They replace him.

00:55.474 --> 00:58.222
Then this guy comes in
and they all head upstairs.

01:01.315 --> 01:01.667
<i>Evening.</i>

01:01.707 --> 01:03.800
Nina Sharp comes in
six minutes later.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

01:21.723 --> 01:23.436
Then it goes black
for four minutes.

01:23.757 --> 01:24.902
What did
he do to her?

01:25.277 --> 01:26.276
<i>Whatever it was...</i>

01:26.433 --> 01:27.870
It only took them
four minutes.

01:28.231 --> 01:29.331
Who is he?

01:32.957 --> 01:34.467
Can we enhance
what he said?

01:34.541 --> 01:35.393
Sure.

01:36.309 --> 01:39.044
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

01:39.234 --> 01:41.981
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

01:42.424 --> 01:45.216
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

01:45.347 --> 01:47.860
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

01:47.992 --> 01:50.463
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

01:50.924 --> 01:52.422
Run it
through voice recognition.

01:58.812 --> 02:01.433
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

02:02.127 --> 02:04.711
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

02:05.338 --> 02:07.923
<i>Take out the camera.
We can do it here.</i>

02:12.223 --> 02:13.944
<i>David Robert Jones.</i>

02:14.461 --> 02:16.058
Why is he
wearing bandages

02:16.113 --> 02:18.074
and the others
are wearing masks?

02:18.515 --> 02:19.596
Not easy to walk around

02:19.641 --> 02:21.277
when you're on half
the world's watch list.

02:21.389 --> 02:23.190
Maybe he's recently tried
to change his appearance.

02:23.225 --> 02:24.596
But all
our information suggests

02:24.630 --> 02:26.205
that Jones
is working for Bell.

02:26.241 --> 02:27.454
So why shoot
his number two?

02:27.495 --> 02:28.552
It doesn't make any sense.

02:28.561 --> 02:30.124
Maybe our information
is wrong.

02:30.814 --> 02:32.237
<i>Why don't we go
straight to the source</i>

02:32.273 --> 02:34.384
<i>and bring William Bell
in for questioning now?</i>

02:34.872 --> 02:35.749
At this point,
I don't think that--

02:35.820 --> 02:37.536
We have solid intelligence
that William Bell

02:37.571 --> 02:39.431
is funding these horrific events
that we've seen.

02:39.509 --> 02:42.063
Most of which
have been carried out by Jones.

02:42.108 --> 02:43.092
- I'm not--
- At this point,

02:43.113 --> 02:45.129
I don't care
<i>how</i> powerful William Bell is

02:45.180 --> 02:47.311
or how deep
his political connections go,

02:47.348 --> 02:49.041
he is not
above the law.

02:49.076 --> 02:51.324
- Dunham--
- Sir, with all due respect,

02:51.354 --> 02:54.320
I have too much in this,
professionally and personally,

02:54.355 --> 02:56.103
that if you stand
in the way now, I--

02:56.138 --> 02:56.880
Dunham!

02:57.560 --> 03:00.033
I came in here to begin
making the calls

03:00.068 --> 03:01.332
I'm going
to need to make in order

03:01.353 --> 03:04.161
to get the interview
that we both agree is necessary.

03:04.391 --> 03:07.310
And I would also request
that you stop cutting me off

03:07.340 --> 03:08.510
every time
I'm about to tell you

03:08.572 --> 03:10.032
to stop drilling,
you've struck oil,

03:10.067 --> 03:12.609
as I was going to do when
we first came through that door.

03:17.839 --> 03:18.913
This is Broyles.

03:24.094 --> 03:25.618
Nina Sharp
is out of surgery.

03:34.313 --> 03:35.026
<i>Hey.</i>

03:35.027 --> 03:35.745
Hey.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.828
Where's Walter?

03:37.680 --> 03:39.220
- With you?
- Uh-uh.

03:39.266 --> 03:40.448
I went to check on him
this morning,

03:40.479 --> 03:41.393
his bed wasn't even
slept in.

03:41.431 --> 03:42.508
I thought he'd worked
here all night.

03:42.540 --> 03:44.166
I thought he went home
with you last night.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.563
Hey, uh,
I need to talk to Walter.

03:47.609 --> 03:48.261
Is he here?

03:48.300 --> 03:49.275
Yeah,
take a number.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.769
I'm gonna
check the cafeteria,

03:50.816 --> 03:51.996
see if he slept
there again.

03:52.033 --> 03:52.636
<i>Okay.</i>

03:54.685 --> 03:55.648
You don't look
so good.

03:56.293 --> 03:58.395
David Robert Jones
shot Nina Sharp.

03:58.543 --> 03:59.337
I wanted to see if--

03:59.368 --> 04:01.720
Hi--Hi, uh,
it's Peter Bishop calling.

04:01.751 --> 04:02.791
I was wondering
if you

04:02.826 --> 04:04.591
maybe have an eye
on my father?

04:05.489 --> 04:06.830
He wandered off again.

04:07.737 --> 04:08.632
Yeah.

04:09.897 --> 04:10.873
Look,
can you do me a favor?

04:10.900 --> 04:12.667
Could you go check down
in the marine biology lab?

04:12.743 --> 04:14.439
He--He sometimes spends
the night down there,

04:14.479 --> 04:16.118
cleaning out the tanks
with Mrs. Ericson.

04:17.803 --> 04:19.892
No, I'll wait--I'll wait.
Thank you.

04:20.002 --> 04:21.457
Do you think he left
because of what I said?

04:22.745 --> 04:24.354
You mean because
of what he is referring to

04:24.393 --> 04:25.728
as "the assault
in the pastry shop?"

04:25.774 --> 04:26.939
I don't know,
it's hard to say.

04:27.233 --> 04:28.868
It was
about Cortexiphan...

04:29.393 --> 04:30.418
Bell's trials.

04:30.454 --> 04:32.973
I wanted to see if Walter
knew what Bell did to me.

04:33.037 --> 04:34.141
I know,
he told me.

04:35.027 --> 04:36.165
You caught him
off-guard.

04:36.884 --> 04:38.447
And I understand
you had your reasons

04:38.499 --> 04:40.275
to saying what it is
that you had to say.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.895
And I know
he understands that too.

04:43.268 --> 04:44.150
He's not there.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.487
No one's seen him.

04:46.518 --> 04:47.218
Hello.

04:49.966 --> 04:50.975
No luck, huh?

04:51.795 --> 04:52.924
Okay, well thanks
for your help.

04:53.679 --> 04:54.318
Peter...

04:54.779 --> 04:58.708
I--I'm sorry
that I was so hard on him.

05:01.011 --> 05:02.438
Look,
don't worry about it.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.872
He's probably
back at the hotel right now,

05:03.906 --> 05:05.994
working his way to the bottom
of a pint of Rocky Road.

06:00.232 --> 06:01.288
I think
to repair that one

06:01.338 --> 06:02.965
<i>requires
a special skill set.</i>

06:05.124 --> 06:05.942
Phillip.

06:07.664 --> 06:08.721
You've been shot.

06:10.154 --> 06:11.674
We discovered
it was Jones.

06:12.909 --> 06:13.776
You're lucky.

06:14.882 --> 06:16.994
Not too many gunshot victims
have come through this way

06:17.000 --> 06:18.828
have Kevlar parts
in their rib cage.

06:19.126 --> 06:20.675
You'll be up and about
in no time.

06:21.442 --> 06:22.743
What did he want,
Nina?

06:23.585 --> 06:24.928
What did he do
to your arm?

06:34.078 --> 06:35.341
Get me
Agent Dunham.

06:36.616 --> 06:38.572
I need to speak with her
right away.

07:02.429 --> 07:03.601
Agent Dunham.

07:11.151 --> 07:12.916
<i>Specialist
from Massive Dynamic.</i>

07:17.057 --> 07:19.035
I'll be right with you,
Agent Dunham.

07:21.214 --> 07:24.028
Let's just say this treatment
doesn't fall under an HMO.

07:25.269 --> 07:25.931
No.

07:48.988 --> 07:51.198
William Bell
is not the problem,

07:51.249 --> 07:52.160
and he's certainly
not the head

07:52.196 --> 07:53.927
of any
terrorist organization.

07:54.178 --> 07:55.389
Well,
I'll make that judgment.

07:55.513 --> 07:56.200
Thank you.

07:56.331 --> 07:58.748
Well, it's true
Jones used to work

07:58.804 --> 08:00.346
for William Bell
15 years ago.

08:00.402 --> 08:02.846
In fact, he was
one of our first employees

08:02.892 --> 08:04.070
at Massive Dynamic.

08:04.273 --> 08:05.845
- But he was let go.
- Why?

08:05.911 --> 08:07.082
<i>The details
are not important.</i>

08:07.124 --> 08:08.375
Suffice to say...

08:08.410 --> 08:10.583
<i>that Jones felt
spurned by the rejection.</i>

08:11.526 --> 08:13.513
William was
a father figure to him,

08:13.584 --> 08:16.205
a respected mentor.

08:16.724 --> 08:19.636
I would go as far as to say that
all the death and destruction

08:19.681 --> 08:21.479
that Jones has caused
up until this point...

08:22.233 --> 08:24.867
has been a way of
proving something to William.

08:25.415 --> 08:26.491
To prove what?

08:26.799 --> 08:29.348
Jones always felt
that he was special

08:29.446 --> 08:31.223
and that
no one recognized that.

08:31.449 --> 08:33.034
Certainly,
not William.

08:33.070 --> 08:33.991
So before the shooting,

08:34.033 --> 08:36.116
when was the last time
you <i>saw</i> David Jones?

08:36.496 --> 08:37.880
Oh, I haven't seen him
for years.

08:38.361 --> 08:39.741
But after
he broke out of prison,

08:40.746 --> 08:42.386
he was contacting
our offices,

08:42.428 --> 08:44.260
requesting meetings
with Dr. Bell.

08:44.472 --> 08:46.804
Over the past few weeks,
his calls have become...

08:47.055 --> 08:47.932
rather extreme.

08:47.938 --> 08:49.919
You've been in contact
with a known felon?

08:50.028 --> 08:51.507
It was
an internal matter.

08:52.848 --> 08:54.650
Clearly, we thought
we could manage this

08:54.681 --> 08:55.810
better than we did.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.796
<i>Apparently,
Jones is ill,</i>

08:58.354 --> 09:00.808
dying from the teleportation
from his prison break.

09:01.846 --> 09:03.220
Nina believes
Jones' agenda is

09:03.275 --> 09:05.020
<i>to kill William Bell
when he finds him.</i>

09:05.055 --> 09:06.164
Then Bell
needs to come in.

09:06.195 --> 09:07.903
We need to put him
into protective custody.

09:08.034 --> 09:10.194
- Not possible.
- Why not? Where is he?

09:10.755 --> 09:11.911
I can't say.

09:12.444 --> 09:13.461
This is ridiculous.

09:13.495 --> 09:14.489
Now, listen to me,
Agent Dunham.

09:14.524 --> 09:16.402
I can't say
because I don't know.

09:18.102 --> 09:20.069
I haven't seen
William Bell for months.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.797
He's been
communicating with me,

09:21.798 --> 09:23.194
strictly electronically.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.326
But what I do know,
though...

09:26.973 --> 09:28.347
is speaking
with William Bell

09:28.394 --> 09:30.850
has become more than
a professional matter for you.

09:31.771 --> 09:34.109
In fact,
I'm counting on that.

09:34.708 --> 09:35.829
Stop Jones...

09:36.159 --> 09:38.187
And I will personally
arrange a meeting

09:38.220 --> 09:39.470
between
you and Bell.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.688
But if Jones
gets to Bell first,

09:46.669 --> 09:48.847
I'm afraid all the answers
you're searching for...

09:49.282 --> 09:50.675
die with him.

09:53.488 --> 09:55.198
What did Jones
want from you?

09:57.559 --> 09:59.525
What did he do to you
in the elevator?

10:06.514 --> 10:10.683
He stole a very powerful...
energy cell

10:11.252 --> 10:13.457
that Dr. Bell
hid within my arm.

10:13.816 --> 10:15.081
What can he do
with it?

10:15.279 --> 10:16.937
Unfortunately,
the question is...

10:17.423 --> 10:19.121
What <i>can't</i> he do?

11:00.466 --> 11:01.586
<i>Oh my God!</i>

11:01.861 --> 11:03.426
- Ah!
- What is that?

11:07.551 --> 11:09.347
<i>Coordinate tracking
is complete, sir.</i>

11:09.559 --> 11:11.000
<i>You can
increase sonic frequency.</i>

11:16.581 --> 11:17.577
It's locked in.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.156
Stabilize, damn it.

11:34.679 --> 11:36.227
<i>The coordinates
are separating, sir.</i>

11:37.973 --> 11:40.052
<i>It's not working,
they're still separating.</i>

11:40.830 --> 11:41.654
<i>We're losing it.</i>

11:42.105 --> 11:43.175
<i>We can't
hold it open.</i>

12:03.099 --> 12:04.467
It's too thick here.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.272
These are
the wrong coordinates.

12:10.273 --> 12:11.813
Try again, please.

12:26.683 --> 12:29.740
S01E20:
There's More Than One of Everything

13:01.119 --> 13:02.758
Do you recognize this?

13:10.654 --> 13:11.796
How did you get that?

13:15.234 --> 13:18.068
<i>This coin looks similar
to the one you're thinking of.</i>

13:18.982 --> 13:20.684
But it is
from another place.

13:23.078 --> 13:25.109
There is more than one
of everything.

13:28.269 --> 13:29.451
I have said
too much,

13:29.492 --> 13:31.148
I am not supposed
to get involved.

13:34.074 --> 13:36.001
I have taken you
as far as I can.

13:37.759 --> 13:39.933
<i>Does this house
look familiar to you?</i>

13:40.082 --> 13:41.077
Yes.

13:43.558 --> 13:45.810
Do you remember
what you have to find?

13:50.806 --> 13:52.756
You must
try to remember.

13:54.989 --> 13:56.376
There isn't much time.

14:29.945 --> 14:31.333
<i>Agent Astrid Farnsworth?</i>

14:32.986 --> 14:34.318
I'd like you
to meet Nina Sharp.

14:37.731 --> 14:38.552
Hello.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.365
Uh...
How are you feeling?

14:43.400 --> 14:46.294
The extent of my injuries
was greatly exaggerated.

14:46.325 --> 14:47.523
We wanted to ask you
a few questions

14:47.558 --> 14:48.587
about Dr. Bishop.

14:49.187 --> 14:49.863
Okay.

14:50.091 --> 14:51.829
Has he been acting
strange lately?

14:52.434 --> 14:54.160
Walter acting strange,
um...

14:54.986 --> 14:56.476
No stranger than usual.

14:56.526 --> 14:57.805
And did he speak
to anyone,

14:57.844 --> 14:59.526
or has anyone
recently contacted him

14:59.562 --> 15:00.750
that you've
never heard of before?

15:00.881 --> 15:02.929
No.
Should I be concerned?

15:03.449 --> 15:04.367
Should she be?

15:04.691 --> 15:06.468
Peter, hello.

15:06.695 --> 15:07.465
Ms. Sharp.

15:07.723 --> 15:08.910
So what's going on here?

15:09.137 --> 15:10.495
Agent Dunham told you
about the attack

15:10.526 --> 15:11.769
by David Robert Jones?

15:11.996 --> 15:12.392
Yeah.

15:12.428 --> 15:13.432
<i>Jones is
in possession</i>

15:13.477 --> 15:14.962
of something
your father may...

15:15.732 --> 15:17.232
know something about.

15:17.701 --> 15:20.032
When was the last time
either of you saw Dr. Bishop?

15:20.313 --> 15:21.602
It was last night.
Why?

15:22.121 --> 15:23.348
You think Jones
has something to do

15:23.381 --> 15:24.358
with his disappearance?

15:24.404 --> 15:25.936
Dr. Bishop gets lost,

15:26.041 --> 15:27.618
more often
than you would imagine.

15:28.188 --> 15:29.130
I'm sure you're right.

15:30.989 --> 15:31.879
This is Broyles.

15:32.086 --> 15:35.132
It's me, I need
a priority one grid search.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.114
Target is
Walter Bishop.

15:42.460 --> 15:43.366
What the hell happened?

15:44.303 --> 15:45.753
Where's the other half
of the truck?

15:48.450 --> 15:49.602
<i>Suddenly,
there was this...</i>

15:50.072 --> 15:51.027
shimmer,
like a...

15:51.477 --> 15:53.391
a curtain almost,
or a window.

15:53.442 --> 15:55.893
My colleague said
you saw a man with a machine.

15:56.113 --> 15:57.265
<i>Well,
what did it look like?</i>

15:57.461 --> 16:00.195
The man was holding, like,
this black square.

16:00.266 --> 16:01.665
<i>Like it was
scanning something.</i>

16:01.700 --> 16:03.573
This truck, it just--
just came out of nowhere.

16:03.615 --> 16:06.183
It just appeared
like it came through the window,

16:06.218 --> 16:08.748
and what was on the other side
of it was different.

16:08.845 --> 16:11.467
It was emitting this sound,
like a loud noise.

16:11.646 --> 16:12.389
<i>It didn't look
like it was doing</i>

16:12.428 --> 16:15.339
anything, but, um...
It did.

16:15.385 --> 16:16.867
Do you remember
what he looked like?

16:17.378 --> 16:18.861
No, he was
wearing a mask.

16:19.457 --> 16:22.331
Are--Are you sure it was a mask
and not bandages?

16:22.519 --> 16:23.732
Yeah,
more like bandages.

16:34.012 --> 16:35.229
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

16:35.846 --> 16:38.296
<i>This image of your father
was taken three hours ago.</i>

16:38.491 --> 16:40.145
Near East Douglas
and Grafton.

16:41.527 --> 16:44.092
Massive Dynamic
maintains access

16:44.136 --> 16:45.596
to all the cameras
we manufacture.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.199
This...
security footage

16:47.234 --> 16:49.140
was from the local
commuter train station.

16:51.503 --> 16:53.870
I think I'm starting
to understand a little better.

16:54.632 --> 16:56.221
This is near a beach house
that we own.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.940
Walter used to love it up there
'cause it's quiet.

16:59.570 --> 17:00.244
<i>My father has had</i>

17:00.278 --> 17:01.944
a particularly rough
couple of days.

17:03.101 --> 17:03.498
I'm not sure that

17:03.558 --> 17:05.237
everything's making sense
to him right now.

17:05.612 --> 17:08.010
We have agents
canvassing the area.

17:08.243 --> 17:09.084
If you give us
the address--

17:09.159 --> 17:10.172
Actually,
if you don't mind...

17:11.511 --> 17:13.708
I'd rather go up there
and bring him back myself.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.497
I think that's
for the best right now.

17:16.069 --> 17:16.978
Of course.

17:19.030 --> 17:19.960
Thanks.

17:22.717 --> 17:23.838
<i>Agent Francis...</i>

17:25.509 --> 17:26.843
The driver died
on impact.

17:26.973 --> 17:28.424
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

17:28.735 --> 17:29.818
That's what we got
so far.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.765
- You sure this is right?
- Yeah.

17:32.471 --> 17:33.171
<i>What?</i>

17:34.353 --> 17:36.246
The prints aren't
coming back on the driver,

17:37.143 --> 17:39.430
the, uh,
the truck isn't registered

17:39.481 --> 17:41.673
in New York,
or anywhere else.

17:41.762 --> 17:44.636
The VIN number,
the serial part numbers...

17:44.953 --> 17:46.163
They don't exist.

17:47.101 --> 17:48.132
What does that mean?

17:49.616 --> 17:51.014
This truck
was never made.

17:52.994 --> 17:54.349
How is that possible?

17:57.709 --> 17:59.068
Where the hell
did it come from?

18:30.946 --> 18:31.771
Walter?

19:21.872 --> 19:23.023
Walter?

19:37.964 --> 19:38.945
Hello, Peter.

19:40.627 --> 19:42.002
Walter,
what are you doing here?

19:42.954 --> 19:44.347
You had us worried.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.369
I'm looking for
something.

19:49.989 --> 19:53.029
I think it...
It might be in this house.

19:54.856 --> 19:56.430
And it's very important.

19:57.918 --> 19:58.858
Okay.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.971
What are you
looking for?

20:03.246 --> 20:04.999
I just can't recall,
son.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.223
That's the thing.

20:07.378 --> 20:09.002
<i>You're not telling us
everything.</i>

20:09.012 --> 20:10.367
If Jones
is looking for Bell,

20:10.408 --> 20:12.322
then what does
an energy cell and a truck

20:12.352 --> 20:14.464
<i>coming from nowhere
have to do with it?</i>

20:14.515 --> 20:16.478
Well, nothing comes out
of nowhere, Agent Dunham.

20:16.703 --> 20:17.891
Then where does
it come from?

20:17.923 --> 20:19.290
I think
you already know that.

20:19.722 --> 20:21.977
And I think you already
suspect where William Bell is.

20:22.003 --> 20:23.787
Are you saying
that you know where Bell is?

20:25.978 --> 20:27.975
Stop playing games
with me.

20:28.435 --> 20:30.123
Tell me where he is,
or I assure you

20:30.133 --> 20:32.324
I will turn this world <i>over</i>
looking for him.

20:36.175 --> 20:37.929
Well, that's just the problem,
Agent Dunham.

20:38.703 --> 20:41.465
William Bell
is not <i>in</i> this world.

21:04.307 --> 21:05.988
<i>You're saying that
William Bell</i>

21:06.374 --> 21:08.394
<i>disappeared
into a different universe?</i>

21:09.001 --> 21:10.539
Like
Dorothy going to Oz?

21:10.595 --> 21:13.417
Well, Walter calls it
an alternate reality.

21:13.731 --> 21:14.695
Do you understand?

21:14.963 --> 21:15.971
Not remotely.

21:16.321 --> 21:17.841
You're saying
that William Bell...

21:18.212 --> 21:19.595
is not
on this planet.

21:19.636 --> 21:20.420
No, he is.

21:20.455 --> 21:22.196
Just another version
of this planet.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.745
Have you had
déjà vu?

21:23.995 --> 21:25.495
Living a moment
you've already lived before?

21:25.546 --> 21:26.363
Yes.

21:26.581 --> 21:29.533
What does déjà vu have to do
with where Bell is?

21:30.014 --> 21:32.551
Well, déjà vu is like
a glimpse into the other side.

21:32.586 --> 21:34.099
You feel like
you've been somewhere before

21:34.134 --> 21:36.949
because actually,
in another reality, you have.

21:37.625 --> 21:39.303
<i>But déjà vu
is just a window.</i>

21:39.327 --> 21:41.523
It's possible some individuals
may be able to do more

21:41.543 --> 21:43.116
than just see
into the other world.

21:43.918 --> 21:45.565
They may
be able to travel there.

21:45.773 --> 21:46.813
So the incident
on the street--

21:46.837 --> 21:48.775
That's why
we can't identify the truck.

21:49.006 --> 21:50.406
Because it came <i>from</i>
the other side.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.077
That's what Jones
is using the energy cell for.

21:53.253 --> 21:54.757
He's trying
to cross over,

21:54.808 --> 21:56.082
to get to Bell.

21:57.999 --> 21:59.014
Broyles.

21:59.559 --> 21:59.903
Dunham.

22:00.359 --> 22:01.526
It's Francis.

22:01.869 --> 22:02.702
Where?

22:06.374 --> 22:08.678
Walter, just--
Just calm down.

22:10.855 --> 22:11.850
<i>Yes, Peter.</i>

22:13.888 --> 22:16.446
I started something
a long time ago,

22:16.481 --> 22:18.553
I did--I did,
it's the truth, I did.

22:20.773 --> 22:21.715
Walter.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.155
And I have
to finish it.

22:23.385 --> 22:23.999
Walter!

22:25.024 --> 22:25.962
- Walter.
- No.

22:26.618 --> 22:27.539
- Damn it.
- <i>I need you to</i>

22:27.574 --> 22:29.201
take a breath
and calm down.

22:29.237 --> 22:30.517
It was
the penthouse.

22:33.623 --> 22:34.398
<i>Walter.</i>

22:34.431 --> 22:35.838
I need you
to take a deep breath.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.039
I can't find it.
I don't know where to look.

22:41.997 --> 22:43.006
I don't know
where to look...

22:46.239 --> 22:46.903
Damn it.

22:47.898 --> 22:49.256
I don't know
where to look.

22:49.302 --> 22:51.202
Walter, Walter,
where are you g--

22:51.237 --> 22:51.900
Walter!

22:52.877 --> 22:53.899
Where are you going?

22:54.389 --> 22:56.169
Walter, look,
it's getting late.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.553
<i>We need
to head back.</i>

22:57.767 --> 22:59.188
No, not yet.

23:05.722 --> 23:06.927
You know,
I remember when we used

23:06.950 --> 23:08.553
to come down here
during the summers.

23:10.255 --> 23:11.099
Mom and I.

23:13.091 --> 23:14.995
You were always
still working back in the city.

23:17.330 --> 23:19.290
I'd stand out here
on the beach for hours...

23:20.400 --> 23:21.470
Looking at the ocean.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.007
Used to seem
like it went on forever.

23:28.430 --> 23:30.065
And on Saturdays...

23:31.011 --> 23:33.439
I'd always wake up
just before my alarm.

23:34.840 --> 23:36.582
I could smell
the pancakes...

23:39.281 --> 23:40.626
Which meant
that you were here.

23:47.678 --> 23:49.558
I'd creep down
the stairs...

23:50.819 --> 23:51.862
And there'd you be.

23:53.775 --> 23:56.000
Standing over the stove,
flipping pancakes.

23:57.653 --> 23:59.304
You seemed so big
back then.

24:01.637 --> 24:03.332
I'd just stand there
watching you.

24:04.938 --> 24:05.945
And you'd always...

24:06.061 --> 24:07.617
- flip one of the pancakes.
- <i>Whales.</i>

24:12.132 --> 24:14.076
I made them
in the shape of whales.

24:15.182 --> 24:16.640
They were your favorite!

24:16.890 --> 24:17.752
Yes.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.989
Peter,
I remember.

24:22.678 --> 24:23.488
Thank you.

24:25.233 --> 24:26.594
I know
why I'm here.

24:28.312 --> 24:30.265
I know where it is.

24:34.753 --> 24:36.627
<i>Okay, so tell me
exactly what you saw.</i>

24:36.892 --> 24:38.355
I was standing there
by the field.

24:38.599 --> 24:40.285
Lance went back,
you know, to get the ball.

24:40.525 --> 24:41.705
That's
when I saw it.

24:41.932 --> 24:43.857
It's like a
see-through wall appeared.

24:44.780 --> 24:45.746
It sort of
shimmered,

24:45.957 --> 24:47.320
like a heat wave,
you know?

24:47.824 --> 24:49.664
Like something was there,
but it wasn't.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.951
What do you mean
it was there and it wasn't?

24:52.386 --> 24:53.979
It was
like a window,

24:54.620 --> 24:55.580
but warped.

24:55.945 --> 24:56.891
Then it shut.

24:57.254 --> 24:58.433
Thank you.

25:00.311 --> 25:00.962
Hey.

25:01.348 --> 25:02.030
Okay.

25:02.691 --> 25:04.507
So him and his friend
are playing soccer.

25:04.707 --> 25:06.115
The kid's running
with the ball,

25:06.499 --> 25:08.594
when all of a sudden,
they see this shimmer of light.

25:08.819 --> 25:10.039
The kid
hits the shimmer,

25:10.253 --> 25:12.668
and then he just,
sort of collapses.

25:12.753 --> 25:14.915
- And did anyone see Jones?
- No.

25:15.735 --> 25:17.133
But there's
a bit more to go.

25:17.377 --> 25:18.697
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

25:19.279 --> 25:21.201
<i>How does something
like that happen?</i>

25:24.563 --> 25:26.442
I can't believe
I'm gonna be saying this.

25:27.104 --> 25:30.259
Let's assume
that Jones is trying to...

25:30.294 --> 25:32.238
make this doorway
into another universe.

25:32.273 --> 25:33.129
Why here?

25:33.405 --> 25:34.930
I mean, first New York,
now here.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.383
What do they have
in common?

25:51.836 --> 25:52.995
Hey Chad,
what you got?

25:53.041 --> 25:54.733
Third floor says
they can't find a connection

25:54.774 --> 25:56.195
between the incident
in New York and the

25:56.230 --> 25:57.244
- <i>one on the soccer field.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

25:57.339 --> 25:57.819
I know.

25:58.130 --> 25:59.667
Look, I want you
to go through our database,

25:59.733 --> 26:01.786
and cross-reference
any incidents connected

26:01.826 --> 26:04.964
to science, biology,
or unexplained phenomenon

26:05.035 --> 26:07.632
and have the file
sent to my office, please.

26:08.314 --> 26:09.555
Dating back how far?

26:10.616 --> 26:11.506
All of them.

26:14.696 --> 26:16.436
Uh, just put them
down there, thank you.

26:18.723 --> 26:20.491
You can roll
that one into the corner.

27:00.482 --> 27:02.860
Sir, we need
to call Nina Sharp.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.249
I think that
I found a connection between

27:04.322 --> 27:05.685
what Jones did
in New York

27:05.720 --> 27:07.627
and that park
in Providence.

27:15.348 --> 27:17.293
Walter, tell me
what you're looking for.

27:23.226 --> 27:24.548
Here.
I got it.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.757
Oh!
It's still here.

27:29.019 --> 27:30.520
I was beginning
to be afraid--

27:47.088 --> 27:48.060
Here.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.098
This is
why we're here.

27:55.735 --> 27:56.699
It's locked.

27:56.734 --> 27:59.176
<i>This is a record
of all local incidents</i>

27:59.237 --> 28:00.297
<i>related
to the Pattern.</i>

28:00.404 --> 28:02.306
Some of these
go back more than 20 years.

28:02.429 --> 28:04.769
But we've done this ourselves
at Massive Dynamic.

28:04.838 --> 28:06.076
A dozen
of our top analysts

28:06.117 --> 28:07.401
have spent the better part
of two years--

28:07.424 --> 28:09.785
Yeah, and there's
seemingly no obvious logic

28:09.841 --> 28:11.069
or predictability.

28:11.235 --> 28:13.143
It took me a while
to see it myself.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.329
But...

28:15.007 --> 28:19.259
These are the spots
where Jones used his device.

28:20.143 --> 28:21.318
Now look at this.

28:27.142 --> 28:28.888
<i>That can't be
a coincidence.</i>

28:29.542 --> 28:30.756
So what does it mean?

28:30.837 --> 28:32.651
I think
I may know.

28:36.779 --> 28:37.358
Got it.

28:45.032 --> 28:46.381
What exactly is that?

28:47.723 --> 28:49.553
When Belly and I
were younger men,

28:50.547 --> 28:54.444
we regularly ingested
large quantities of LSD.

28:55.057 --> 28:55.807
You don't say?

28:55.983 --> 28:57.924
We became convinced
what we saw

28:58.022 --> 28:59.348
while on the drug
was real.

28:59.579 --> 29:01.270
We believed
that we were

29:01.319 --> 29:04.149
catching glimpses
of another reality.

29:04.241 --> 29:06.391
Another world
just like ours...

29:07.095 --> 29:08.341
But slightly different,

29:09.485 --> 29:13.602
Populated by slightly
different versions of ourselves.

29:13.627 --> 29:16.546
We all experience it
momentarily as déjà vu.

29:16.709 --> 29:19.681
And Belly and I could prolong it
with hallucinogenics.

29:19.876 --> 29:21.562
But the question
of course was:

29:23.791 --> 29:25.687
How to get there
without LSD?

29:25.804 --> 29:28.182
Belly, as you know,
theorized that young children

29:28.509 --> 29:32.277
have the capacity to see
these other worlds naturally.

29:32.483 --> 29:34.024
I know, you already
told me about that.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.384
Bell's experiments
with Cortexiphan.

29:36.536 --> 29:37.060
<i>Yes.</i>

29:37.111 --> 29:38.942
He theorized
that properly nurtured,

29:39.278 --> 29:40.719
these abilities
could be heightened,

29:40.912 --> 29:41.950
intensified,

29:42.160 --> 29:44.723
and that in time,
his subjects may be able

29:44.758 --> 29:47.338
<i>may be able to travel
from here to there.</i>

29:47.480 --> 29:48.414
Over there?

29:50.024 --> 29:51.572
You mean
an alternate world?

29:56.755 --> 29:58.033
Around this time,

29:58.968 --> 30:01.276
something was lost
to me, Peter.

30:01.866 --> 30:03.431
Something precious.

30:03.994 --> 30:08.576
I became convinced that
if only I could cross over myself,

30:08.896 --> 30:12.842
then I could <i>take</i> from there
what I had lost here.

30:14.119 --> 30:14.789
And what was
the plan?

30:14.839 --> 30:15.898
You were just gonna
open up a hole

30:15.919 --> 30:17.310
and then walk over
to the other side?

30:17.405 --> 30:19.928
No...
It's not that simple.

30:21.289 --> 30:23.330
You have to find
the right place first.

30:24.812 --> 30:25.987
<i>Finding the right place</i>

30:26.033 --> 30:27.740
<i>to cross over
is the key.</i>

30:27.775 --> 30:31.886
Dr. Bell once posited
that our world has "soft spots,"

30:32.000 --> 30:34.525
<i>places where the fundamental
constants of nature--</i>

30:34.562 --> 30:36.897
The speed of light,
gravity,

30:37.106 --> 30:39.208
The mass of a proton,
for example,

30:39.396 --> 30:40.851
have begun
to decay.

30:41.859 --> 30:44.477
As a result,
in these particular areas,

30:44.943 --> 30:47.683
<i>the membrane between
the realities is thinner,</i>

30:47.724 --> 30:49.004
almost porous.

30:49.543 --> 30:51.935
Well, the Bermuda Triangle
is one,

30:52.020 --> 30:53.027
<i>but there are others.</i>

30:53.062 --> 30:54.210
<i>And until recently,</i>

30:54.408 --> 30:56.695
these areas
were extremely rare.

30:57.396 --> 30:58.584
What do you mean
"until recently"?

30:58.640 --> 30:59.432
What happened?

30:59.622 --> 31:01.385
We happened,
Agent Dunham.

31:01.863 --> 31:04.236
Scientific progress,
advancing technologies.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.197
By meddling
with the laws of nature,

31:06.228 --> 31:09.238
has hastened the decay
of these constant fundamentals

31:09.292 --> 31:11.781
and increased
the number of soft spots.

31:12.314 --> 31:13.832
So you're suggesting
Jones is looking

31:13.868 --> 31:15.043
for one of these
soft spots.

31:15.094 --> 31:15.762
Yes.

31:16.110 --> 31:18.845
In the belief that by releasing
the right kind of energy,

31:19.259 --> 31:22.119
and aiming it exactly
at the proper spot,

31:23.108 --> 31:25.107
he could effectively
break through.

31:25.876 --> 31:27.101
<i>Of course,
there's a problem</i>

31:27.208 --> 31:28.898
<i>opening a hole
to another reality.</i>

31:29.159 --> 31:33.745
In theory, that would
also allow things from there

31:33.848 --> 31:35.502
to pass over here,

31:37.198 --> 31:39.001
which could be
dangerous.

31:40.138 --> 31:43.680
And so,
I also built a plug.

31:44.142 --> 31:45.046
A plug?

31:45.303 --> 31:47.477
Actually,
more a patch

31:49.202 --> 31:51.827
to close the hole
should the need ever arise.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.326
This is that patch,
Peter.

31:53.420 --> 31:54.599
This is
what I had to find.

31:54.634 --> 31:55.902
Okay,
just so I'm clear.

31:56.732 --> 32:00.363
Somewhere out there, there is
a hole to another reality,

32:00.373 --> 32:01.496
and you need
to plug it?

32:01.545 --> 32:02.613
Yes,
I'm afraid so.

32:02.798 --> 32:04.373
Well, do you know
where it is?

32:04.923 --> 32:05.740
Yes.

32:06.762 --> 32:07.767
Yes,
I do, Peter.

32:09.308 --> 32:10.977
Reiden.
Reiden Lake.

32:11.393 --> 32:13.209
<i>We have to identify
another soft spot,</i>

32:13.275 --> 32:14.643
then we'll know
where he's going.

32:14.702 --> 32:16.295
We should expand
the search perimeters.

32:16.454 --> 32:18.338
Did you map events
beyond the eastern seaboard?

32:18.582 --> 32:19.767
No,
they're not in our database.

32:19.802 --> 32:20.601
I'll call my office

32:20.636 --> 32:22.412
and have the files
transferred to your system.

32:22.537 --> 32:24.260
Which of these events
are the oldest?

32:24.477 --> 32:25.360
Do you remember?

32:26.316 --> 32:28.848
I mean,
these events are somehow

32:28.853 --> 32:30.862
consequences
of soft spots--

32:31.022 --> 32:31.580
Well...

32:33.206 --> 32:35.045
These are
the first recorded incidents.

32:36.050 --> 32:38.162
They all go back
more than 15 years.

32:38.992 --> 32:40.026
Becca's Meadow...

32:40.166 --> 32:41.839
<i>That was the site
of the first incident</i>

32:41.885 --> 32:42.904
<i>we know about.</i>

32:45.964 --> 32:46.787
Wait...

32:47.964 --> 32:50.427
All of these incidents
point to here.

32:50.745 --> 32:51.943
That's where
he's going.

32:53.396 --> 32:54.943
Reiden Lake.

32:58.870 --> 33:01.015
Get all the gear,
get set up.

33:15.310 --> 33:16.155
Come on, men.

33:16.326 --> 33:17.894
We're going
to the other side.

33:26.110 --> 33:28.109
It's just
the other side of the lake.

33:28.761 --> 33:30.483
<i>The place where
I opened the hole.</i>

33:31.904 --> 33:33.501
That's awfully
convenient.

33:33.892 --> 33:35.224
Not convenient
at all.

33:35.259 --> 33:35.942
That's why I bought

33:35.997 --> 33:37.496
the beach house
in the first place.

33:37.906 --> 33:38.796
The proximity.

33:39.940 --> 33:41.577
Come on, Peter.
Can't you go faster?

33:41.800 --> 33:43.106
We may not have
much time.

33:43.158 --> 33:43.907
After all
these years,

33:43.938 --> 33:45.533
what's going to happen
if we're not <i>on</i> time?

33:45.621 --> 33:46.767
I don't know!

33:47.880 --> 33:50.305
But my friend came
and he said we must.

33:50.521 --> 33:52.649
He only comes when
it's of dire consequence.

33:52.705 --> 33:54.023
And what friend
would that be?

33:54.160 --> 33:55.468
The bald one.

33:56.251 --> 33:58.498
You mean the one that
Olivia calls 'The Observer'?

33:58.545 --> 33:59.225
Yes.

33:59.462 --> 34:01.240
The man who attacked me
in the woods.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.799
He must've
had a very good reason.

34:03.369 --> 34:05.084
I'm sure he didn't mean you
any harm.

34:05.171 --> 34:06.974
What else aren't
you telling me, Walter?

34:07.558 --> 34:08.906
Lots,
I'm sure,

34:09.175 --> 34:10.780
but none of it
is relevant.

34:11.972 --> 34:15.353
Can't--it's been so long.
This all looks the same.

34:15.862 --> 34:18.255
Oh...
Peter, Peter, Peter, Peter.

34:18.312 --> 34:18.760
Peter!

34:18.795 --> 34:19.768
<i>Stop it!
Stop!</i>

34:25.699 --> 34:26.623
Okay.

34:26.860 --> 34:27.621
Now what?

34:38.965 --> 34:40.741
That thing's not going
to blow up, is it?

34:42.431 --> 34:43.766
I certainly
hope not.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.123
What?

34:51.565 --> 34:53.223
You may not
remember this.

34:53.442 --> 34:54.349
When you were
a boy,

34:54.400 --> 34:56.101
- you were very sick, dying.
- Walter.

34:56.257 --> 34:57.794
And sometimes,
you got scared.

34:58.016 --> 34:59.944
And to calm yourself,

35:00.568 --> 35:02.098
to forget what you were
going through,

35:02.174 --> 35:04.535
you took
to collecting coins.

35:06.189 --> 35:06.918
This one...

35:09.670 --> 35:10.904
This was
your favorite.

35:16.363 --> 35:17.111
You're right.

35:18.012 --> 35:19.231
I don't remember
any of that.

35:21.713 --> 35:22.907
I do.

35:26.954 --> 35:28.053
Walter!

35:31.831 --> 35:33.137
- It's okay, it's okay.
- Easy, easy.

35:33.172 --> 35:34.531
- Take it easy.
- <i>Hey, they're with me.</i>

35:34.595 --> 35:35.639
- Easy, easy.
- It's okay.

35:37.324 --> 35:38.537
Agent Dunham...

35:38.771 --> 35:39.980
H-How did you know
where we were?

35:39.996 --> 35:41.267
What are you
doing here?

35:41.413 --> 35:43.333
We're trying to plug a hole
in the universe.

35:43.369 --> 35:44.499
What are you
doing here?

35:45.310 --> 35:47.849
- Apparently the same thing.
- But how did you--

35:49.251 --> 35:50.411
<i>Oh no.</i>

35:52.165 --> 35:53.130
What is that?

36:22.435 --> 36:23.769
Dr. Bishop,
stay down.

36:26.431 --> 36:29.094
Keep going please.
Don't stop what you're doing.

36:29.605 --> 36:31.174
<i>Hold them off
as long as you can.</i>

36:33.503 --> 36:34.852
Olivia,
I'll cover you.

36:38.876 --> 36:41.305
Walter!
Hey, Walter, stay here.

36:41.341 --> 36:43.053
They'll need this
to close the portal,

36:43.102 --> 36:44.549
to prevent him
from going over.

36:44.786 --> 36:45.663
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

36:46.383 --> 36:47.582
- Give it to me!
- Okay.

36:47.605 --> 36:48.200
All right.

36:48.780 --> 36:50.429
It's simple,
a child could do it.

36:50.596 --> 36:52.537
You just twist this.

37:00.649 --> 37:01.777
<i>What's the status?</i>

37:03.501 --> 37:05.285
<i>Coordinates
are coming into place, sir.</i>

37:07.240 --> 37:08.688
We're almost there,
sir.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.624
Jones?

37:17.790 --> 37:18.760
Don't move.

37:19.706 --> 37:21.444
Manifold is stable.

37:21.613 --> 37:22.480
Don't move.

37:29.438 --> 37:31.689
Stop!
Don't move.

37:33.007 --> 37:34.256
Beautiful,
isn't it?

37:36.079 --> 37:37.990
<i>You'll understand
if this reunion is brief.</i>

37:38.062 --> 37:40.293
If you take one more step,
I'll shoot.

37:40.529 --> 37:41.957
Goodbye,
Agent Dunham.

37:42.121 --> 37:42.643
Don't!

37:55.963 --> 37:57.133
The teleporter...

37:58.654 --> 38:00.644
It may be killing me,
but in the meantime,

38:01.825 --> 38:04.104
It's made me something
rather special.

38:04.678 --> 38:07.994
<i>You see, your bullets
just go right through me.</i>

38:08.152 --> 38:11.878
And soon Dr. Bell will see
just how special I am.

38:17.626 --> 38:18.826
- Stop!
- Dunham!

38:51.494 --> 38:52.408
Hey.

38:54.795 --> 38:55.592
Hey.

38:58.647 --> 39:00.614
Under normal circumstances,
I would ask you

39:00.650 --> 39:02.037
when I could expect
your report.

39:03.750 --> 39:06.001
But in this case, I find myself
at a bit of a loss.

39:06.708 --> 39:07.929
How is Nina?

39:08.002 --> 39:09.102
She's doing fine.

39:10.067 --> 39:11.853
She wanted me
to convey her gratitude.

39:16.470 --> 39:17.623
What?

39:18.339 --> 39:19.777
We've been told
to cease and desist

39:19.823 --> 39:21.630
our investigation
into William Bell.

39:21.888 --> 39:22.916
By whom?

39:23.347 --> 39:25.155
The kind of people that
when they give you an order,

39:25.211 --> 39:26.383
you don't question it.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.752
I'm sorry.

39:38.223 --> 39:39.272
Dr. Bishop...

39:39.520 --> 39:40.890
Good news.

39:42.347 --> 39:43.990
I got you
some berry boom.

39:48.099 --> 39:48.802
<i>Hey.</i>

39:49.674 --> 39:50.408
What's wrong?

40:10.078 --> 40:11.461
"I'm stepping out
for a bit.

40:11.892 --> 40:14.040
Don't worry about me, son.
I know where I'm going."

40:16.135 --> 40:17.375
You want me
to call the police?

40:21.663 --> 40:22.452
No.

40:26.206 --> 40:28.448
That is the first time
he's ever written a note.

40:30.334 --> 40:32.128
I think our little boy
is growing up.

41:31.356 --> 41:31.962
Hello?

41:32.265 --> 41:34.739
<i>Agent Dunham,
it's Nina Sharp.</i>

41:34.759 --> 41:36.156
<i>You held up
your end of the bargain.</i>

41:36.194 --> 41:37.948
<i>Now,
I'd like to hold up mine.</i>

41:38.190 --> 41:40.001
<i>Would you mind coming
to Manhattan tomorrow?</i>

41:40.030 --> 41:40.786
Sure.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.142
<i>Do you know the Mutsumi Hotel
on Broadway?</i>

41:43.714 --> 41:44.330
Yes.

41:44.377 --> 41:46.249
<i>Great.
Tomorrow it is, then.</i>

41:46.291 --> 41:49.061
<i>I hope you understand
why I can't go through channels.</i>

41:49.282 --> 41:51.481
<i>And I appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone</i>

41:51.512 --> 41:52.528
<i>about this either.</i>

41:52.740 --> 41:54.832
<i>I don't mean
to sound overly cautious,</i>

41:54.867 --> 41:57.129
<i>but I think
you'll soon understand</i>

41:57.205 --> 41:59.260
<i>why we'll want
to keep this between us.</i>

41:59.625 --> 42:00.919
<i>Let's say 1:00?</i>

42:01.131 --> 42:02.130
<i>Come alone.</i>

42:02.484 --> 42:04.116
<i>I'll answer
any questions you have.</i>

42:25.759 --> 42:26.735
No,
thank you.

42:43.286 --> 42:44.399
Uh, Nina Sharp?

42:45.788 --> 42:47.159
Olivia Dunham.

42:51.167 --> 42:52.656
Uh, no, I don't want
to leave a message.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.085
She's expecting
my call.

42:57.212 --> 42:59.309
What do you mean
she's out of the country?

43:58.164 --> 43:59.540
Agent Dunham,
welcome.

44:00.859 --> 44:01.695
Right this way.

44:10.650 --> 44:11.269
Go right in.

45:01.831 --> 45:04.586
I've been waiting
quite a long time for this.

45:07.124 --> 45:08.163
Where am I?

45:11.112 --> 45:12.138
Who are you?

45:12.894 --> 45:15.309
The answer
to your first question is--

45:16.320 --> 45:18.172
It's very complicated.

45:19.941 --> 45:21.526
The answer
to your second...

45:23.817 --> 45:25.368
I'm William Bell.
