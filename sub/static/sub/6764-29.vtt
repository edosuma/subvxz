02:00.887 --> 02:03.583
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Thank you, Suzanne.

02:03.756 --> 02:06.156
So anyway,
since Andrea's really wigging out

02:06.326 --> 02:07.850
from being on 24-hour bed rest,

02:08.026 --> 02:10.426
I told her we'd have our
sorority meeting over there tomorrow.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.497
That's a good idea.
I hope Brenda can make it.

02:12.665 --> 02:15.930
Yeah, I just hope she doesn't flip out
if she's not cast in the play.

02:16.102 --> 02:18.696
So she really blew
her final audition, huh?

02:18.872 --> 02:21.636
Let's just say
it wasn't her strongest performance.

02:22.809 --> 02:25.676
So how many pounds of ground beef
do you serve in a day?

02:25.845 --> 02:26.869
Erica.

02:27.046 --> 02:29.139
What's going on, sweetheart?
You taking inventory?

02:29.315 --> 02:32.580
It's for school. We have to do a report
on what our parents do for work.

02:32.752 --> 02:34.344
I still think it would be
more educational

02:34.521 --> 02:35.920
to see where Kevin works.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.080
It wouldn't be the same.

02:38.258 --> 02:41.284
You know, I'd kind of be interested
in taking a tour of Kevin's laboratory.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.190
See what he's doing to save the bay.

02:43.363 --> 02:45.957
Maybe if we talk to him,
you and I can go down there together.

02:46.132 --> 02:48.293
Okay. I bet nobody else in my class

02:48.468 --> 02:50.663
is doing a report
on an environmental chemist.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.998
Sounds like a winner to me.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.572
Guys, guess what.
I got the lead of Maggie the Cat.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.110
Well, way to go, sister Brenda.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.975
- Good job, Bren.
- Thank you, thank you.

03:02.148 --> 03:03.479
So does this mean you're a star?

03:04.150 --> 03:06.050
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

03:08.221 --> 03:11.349
Dude,
I thought you said she choked.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.052
- I got the part.
- Oh, my God.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.785
Oh, Bren, I'm so happy.

03:15.962 --> 03:17.987
And you thought you'd blown
your final audition.

03:18.164 --> 03:19.290
Kelly, I did blow it.

03:19.465 --> 03:21.228
But afterwards,
I went to Roy Randolph's house

03:21.401 --> 03:22.800
and he gave me a second chance.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.266
Well, when do rehearsals start?

03:24.437 --> 03:26.496
Well, we have our first table reading
this afternoon.

03:26.906 --> 03:29.397
Well, can you make a sorority meeting
over at Andrea's tomorrow?

03:29.576 --> 03:31.339
Yeah, I have to check
when my rehearsals are.

03:31.511 --> 03:32.910
- Can I let you know?
- Sure.

03:33.079 --> 03:36.344
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Nat, I got the part.

03:36.516 --> 03:40.316
All right.
Our own little Hepburn. My.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.544
And you thought
she wouldn't get cast.

03:44.490 --> 03:47.482
I still can't believe
you weren't cast in that part.

03:47.660 --> 03:51.027
- What is Randolph thinking?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

03:51.598 --> 03:54.066
You were robbed, Laura.
Plain and simple, you were robbed.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.169
- News flash, life is unfair.
- I'm gonna find this Randolph

03:57.337 --> 03:59.032
and I'm gonna tell him
he's out of his mind.

03:59.205 --> 04:01.673
Please don't, Steve. It's done.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.036
At this point,
I just wanna be the understudy

04:05.211 --> 04:06.405
and get through this.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.513
Laura, still,
you deserve a straight answer.

04:09.215 --> 04:11.843
What makes you think you'll get
a straight answer from Randolph?

04:12.318 --> 04:13.876
What do you mean?

04:14.821 --> 04:17.880
Randolph's famous for sleeping
with his leading ladies, isn't he?

04:19.524 --> 04:23.552
Well, that might be his style,
but it's really not Brenda's.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.228
Well, you know her better than I do.

04:31.137 --> 04:35.597
Oh, you guys think of everything.
Absolutely.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.240
Oh, don't forget my notes
from Poli Sci.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.403
Great, I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay, bye.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.607
Do you know
what kind of friends I have?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.183
Andrea, do you wanna go
into premature labor again?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.445
Jesse, look, I just got up
to answer the phone.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.249
- And what about yesterday?
- What about yesterday?

04:51.424 --> 04:52.618
Well, I ran into Mrs. Grayson,

04:52.792 --> 04:54.783
and she told me she saw you out
collecting the mail.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.987
Look, she's just a busybody, okay?
She needs to get a life.

04:58.164 --> 05:02.157
Andrea, come on, I'm serious.
You've got to stay off your feet.

05:02.335 --> 05:05.327
Jesse,
I am doing the best I can, okay?

05:10.376 --> 05:12.537
Honey, look.

05:13.046 --> 05:17.449
I know how frustrating it's gotta be
being stuck in bed all day.

05:18.718 --> 05:21.710
The worst part is this damn medication
they gave me for the contractions.

05:21.888 --> 05:24.015
Jesse, it's just making me speedy
and nuts.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.555
But...

05:27.960 --> 05:31.862
- But it's for a good cause, right?
- Right.

05:32.031 --> 05:34.761
And it will all be over
in a couple of months.

05:36.102 --> 05:39.503
- Yeah.
- And I love you.

05:42.375 --> 05:43.399
Yeah.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.839
I gotta get out of here.
I won't be home too late.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.482
Have a good day.

05:51.818 --> 05:52.944
That seems to be everything.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.586
Well, thank you so much
for coming in.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.745
Brandon, come in.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.552
Sit down. There's been a new wrinkle
we have to discuss.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.855
Is everything okay?

06:05.698 --> 06:09.600
Remember that statement you wrote
about the status of public education?

06:09.769 --> 06:11.361
It's gonna be part
of the keynote speech

06:11.537 --> 06:14.005
when the National Task Force
convenes in Washington.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.105
- You're kidding.
- No.

06:17.276 --> 06:21.508
And they've requested that you
come up to Berkeley next week

06:21.681 --> 06:24.081
to be part
of the final strategy session.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.650
- Well, count me in. I'm honored.
- Well, you should be.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.185
Just don't go too berserkly
up in Berkeley.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.958
- Excuse me?
- Well, aren't you the same Brandon

06:33.126 --> 06:36.687
who kept my Clare out
till the wee hours on her prom night?

06:36.863 --> 06:40.492
Actually, sir, I was hoping
that was something we could discuss.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.657
Please, I'm fine with it.

06:42.835 --> 06:44.598
You're a big improvement
over most of the lugs

06:44.771 --> 06:46.432
she's gone out with.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.005
I don't know what it is.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.602
All of them seem to wind up
in hot water.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.137
That may not be
entirely their fault, sir.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.539
Kids.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.344
I've had to raise Clare on my own
ever since her mother died.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.680
I think I've done a pretty good job,
if I do say so myself.

07:03.790 --> 07:08.022
Yes, you have. Definitely.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.892
The cast's all here, Mr. Randolph.

07:12.064 --> 07:15.056
Good.
I have just three and a half weeks

07:15.234 --> 07:18.761
to teach you all
the art of dreaming on schedule.

07:18.938 --> 07:23.102
But to achieve this theatrical nirvana
requires discipline,

07:23.276 --> 07:27.474
which is why your schedule starts
with Randolph's first law.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.377
- Eddie?
- Never be late to rehearsal.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.711
Be here and ready to go
at the call time.

07:33.186 --> 07:37.782
Do the words, "zero tolerance"
grab your attention?

07:39.559 --> 07:41.789
Now, before we begin
our first read-through,

07:41.961 --> 07:44.794
I'd like to introduce
our illustrious cast.

07:44.964 --> 07:48.024
The part of Big Daddy
will be played by Jackson Halley.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.533
Joan Lebovitz, Big Mama.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.137
The part of Brick will be played
by Carl Mars.

07:53.306 --> 07:57.037
And the part of Maggie the Cat
will be played by Brenda Walsh.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.201
Can we refer to her
by her proper name, Margaret?

07:59.378 --> 08:01.005
At least
until I get to know her better.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.238
Good instinct.

08:02.415 --> 08:05.475
Always give yourself
room to grow into your character.

08:05.651 --> 08:09.212
The part of Brick
will be understudied by Ken Nathan,

08:09.388 --> 08:12.482
and the part of Maggie...
Excuse me, Margaret.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.689
- Will be understudied
by Laura Kingman.

08:21.934 --> 08:23.629
Go get it.

08:25.238 --> 08:26.899
Oh, David, this is crazy.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.904
Rocky's too young
to be catching a Frisbee.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.942
Well, if he starts now,
he'll learn early.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.404
Isn't that Steve?

08:37.616 --> 08:40.643
- Kelly.
- Fancy meeting you here.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.119
Well, I tried your apartment,
and I figured you'd be down here.

08:44.290 --> 08:47.350
- What's up?
- What's up? Well, not much.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.154
Not much at all, actually.

08:49.328 --> 08:53.662
I'm certifiable, Laura's devastated.
Other than that, not much.

08:53.833 --> 08:57.496
Yeah, I'm sorry. It must have been
a major disappointment for her.

08:58.404 --> 08:59.666
Kelly, tell me the truth.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.433
I mean, maybe I'm not seeing things
because I'm too close,

09:02.608 --> 09:04.906
but you were at the final audition.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.602
How could Laura not get cast
in the part?

09:08.180 --> 09:10.444
Steve, calm down.
Brenda told me what happened.

09:10.616 --> 09:12.607
What happened?
What did she do? Put a spell on him?

09:12.785 --> 09:14.946
No, it's simple. Last night,
she went over to Randolph's

09:15.121 --> 09:16.645
and he gave her a second chance.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.086
Yeah, I saw Brenda this morning.
She was really excited.

09:19.825 --> 09:23.283
I'll bet. All of a sudden,
it's starting to make sense to me.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.054
Laura gives the performance
of a lifetime

09:25.231 --> 09:27.392
and Brenda goes down in flames.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.296
Then Brenda shows up
on Randolph's doorstep,

09:29.468 --> 09:31.026
and all of a sudden,
she gets the part?

09:31.837 --> 09:34.533
Steve, are you suggesting
that Brenda slept with him?

09:34.707 --> 09:36.038
You said it, not me.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.978
That's ridiculous.
Kelly, tell him he's being ridiculous.

09:40.146 --> 09:41.841
Steve, you're being ridiculous.

09:42.014 --> 09:45.006
- Kelly.
- I'm not saying I think it's true,

09:45.184 --> 09:47.812
but Randolph did
kind of come on to me.

09:47.987 --> 09:49.249
I mean, it was nothing specific,

09:49.422 --> 09:52.653
but he made it clear
that if I was into it, he was available.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.617
And you remember
how crazed Brenda got

09:54.794 --> 09:56.421
when Kelly was auditioning
for the part.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.120
I'm telling you,

09:58.297 --> 10:00.231
Brenda would have done anything
for that part.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.602
What is wrong with you guys?
Brenda is our friend.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.738
You know
she would never do anything like that.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.105
You can't tell me
you believe that crap.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.946
I didn't say I believed it.
I was asking for your opinion.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.350
You want my opinion?
All right, I'll give you my opinion.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.114
- It never happened.
- Well, Steve said...

10:25.291 --> 10:26.724
I don't care what Steve said, Kelly,

10:26.892 --> 10:28.655
he's going out
with Brenda's understudy.

10:28.828 --> 10:31.626
The man is not thinking with his head.
He's thinking with his zipper.

10:32.031 --> 10:34.226
Oh, and you don't think
that Roy Randolph has a zipper?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.992
I thought you said
you didn't believe it.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.760
I don't.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.802
- Let's change the subject.
- Okay, fine.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.572
Better get that.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.319
Are we catching you at a bad time?

10:57.490 --> 11:00.152
Oh, no, actually, it couldn't be
more perfect, could it, Kel?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.350
Come on in.

11:01.527 --> 11:03.893
- Hi, Kelly.
- Hi.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.554
You got pastries from La Pont.
Must be a special occasion.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.394
- It is.
- Well, what's up?

11:09.568 --> 11:12.765
Mom's getting married
and I get to be the maid of honor.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.368
Wow, that is wonderful.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.908
Kevin, congratulations, man.
I'm very happy.

11:19.078 --> 11:20.102
Thanks, Dylan.

11:20.279 --> 11:22.747
Well, it certainly has been
a whirlwind courtship

11:22.948 --> 11:24.108
for you two, hasn't it?

11:25.384 --> 11:27.318
It is kind of impetuous.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.852
Yeah.
But when something is this right,

11:30.022 --> 11:32.786
there's no reason
to mess around with fate, you know?

11:32.958 --> 11:34.016
Absolutely.

11:34.994 --> 11:38.327
- So can we have dessert now?
- Yes, but just one piece.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.897
I don't want you bouncing off the walls
all night, girl.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.695
- Mom.
- Oh, yeah.

11:44.904 --> 11:46.565
Why can't you even be happy
for them?

11:46.972 --> 11:47.996
I am.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.371
Well, what's with that little wisecrack
about the whirlwind-romance thing?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.670
I was just being friendly.

11:52.845 --> 11:56.144
But the fact is, they've only known
each other for a couple of weeks.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.078
Why are you so negative, Kel?

12:09.195 --> 12:10.219
Laura.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.233
- Steve, hi.
- Hi.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.926
Come in.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.897
So how was rehearsal?

12:23.275 --> 12:27.769
- It was humiliating.
- Humiliating? What happened?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.414
We had to sit around a table
and read the play.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.178
Well, they read it and I listened.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.446
Oh, Laura, you'll get your turn.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.112
They have to rehearse
the understudies.

12:41.026 --> 12:44.655
Roy Randolph
will never have time for me.

12:45.264 --> 12:48.165
Not the way
Brenda monopolizes him.

12:48.334 --> 12:51.735
Every scene, every line,
she has a million questions.

12:51.904 --> 12:56.932
It's like she's the only one
in the cast. I could just strangle her.

12:57.676 --> 13:01.908
- Well, wait tell you hear this.
- What?

13:03.048 --> 13:04.845
Guess who dropped by
Roy Randolph's house

13:05.017 --> 13:06.041
late last night.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.419
Why aren't I surprised?

13:11.524 --> 13:14.186
I still can't believe Brenda
would do something that sleazy.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.089
I should have done it too.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.526
It's not as if
I didn't have the opportunity.

13:18.697 --> 13:20.597
Oh, yeah,
but you're not that kind of person.

13:20.766 --> 13:22.927
Besides, how would you live
with yourself?

13:23.102 --> 13:25.662
I couldn't feel any worse
than I do now.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.708
Coming.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.748
- Clare.
- Special delivery.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.148
What's this?

13:42.321 --> 13:46.087
Two round-trip airplane tickets,
courtesy of University Travel.

13:46.258 --> 13:48.658
- Two?
- I'm going to Berkeley with you.

13:49.762 --> 13:52.162
No. No, absolutely not.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.697
You know,
this couldn't come at a better time.

13:54.867 --> 13:58.701
It's tough when you're accepted
to every university you apply to.

13:58.871 --> 14:01.465
This way, I can check out Berkeley
and you'll be there to help me.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.073
Does your father know about this?

14:04.443 --> 14:06.308
What do you think?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.609
Good morning, Mr. And Mrs. Walsh.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.443
- Hey, Clare.
- What a nice surprise.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.278
Won't you stay
and have breakfast with us?

14:13.452 --> 14:15.386
Clare can't, Mom.
She was just leaving.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.715
Brandon's right.
I really ought to be getting to school.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.755
- Yeah.
- Next time.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.062
- We'll talk.
- Yeah.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.261
So, what's your problem with Clare?
She seems very nice.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.371
Yeah, for your average serial killer.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.268
She's more dangerous
than Lucinda, Dad.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.669
Oh, come on. She's so young.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.970
Yeah, well, it's getting real old.
I'm trying to do right by the chancellor

14:40.145 --> 14:42.340
and keep her at arm's length,
but she just won't let up.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.380
The chancellor doesn't seem to mind
you going out with her.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.314
That's because he has no idea
what she's into.

14:47.486 --> 14:49.579
I've tried to tell him,
he just doesn't wanna hear it.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.950
Well, be gentle with him, son.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.116
Just remember,
every father's daughter is a virgin.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.460
Hello.

15:01.634 --> 15:06.003
Yes, hold on, I'll go get her.
Oh, okay, I can do that.

15:06.472 --> 15:11.068
Rehearsal has been changed
from 1:00 to 4.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.270
Yes,
I'll see Brenda gets the message.

15:14.446 --> 15:15.845
Thank you.

15:16.015 --> 15:20.384
And have a nice day.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.356
What's in here?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.797
Oh, some raw sewage,
some chemical pollutants,

15:36.969 --> 15:40.666
industrial waste,
just your basic toxic smorgasbord.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.643
Okay, now imagine
that what you're looking at over there

15:44.810 --> 15:48.644
is not some glorified toilet bowl,
but the Pacific Ocean.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.611
Same difference.

15:50.783 --> 15:55.015
So if you would do the honors,
young lady.

15:56.455 --> 15:59.481
- What's in the beaker?
- If I told you, I'd be shot at dawn.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.523
But essentially,
it's just some microorganisms

16:01.694 --> 16:02.922
I've been playing around with.

16:03.896 --> 16:04.920
Nothing's happening.

16:05.097 --> 16:09.898
No, and nothing will happen
until we turn on Mr. Sunlamp.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.093
And then what?

16:11.270 --> 16:14.933
You can drink it, you can bathe in it,
anything you want.

16:15.107 --> 16:18.668
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah, it's called bioremediation.

16:18.844 --> 16:22.541
Here. Why don't you take a look
at what's going on

16:22.748 --> 16:23.976
under the microscope?

16:25.484 --> 16:28.749
So if you put enough
of these microorganism into the bay?

16:28.921 --> 16:30.548
You could go surfing every day

16:30.723 --> 16:32.748
and never have to worry
about getting infected.

16:33.292 --> 16:36.022
Wow, that's incredible.
So when's it gonna be on the market?

16:36.195 --> 16:38.026
At this rate, I'd say never.

16:38.464 --> 16:39.863
Why?

16:41.100 --> 16:44.968
Officially,
because it's not cost-effective.

16:45.137 --> 16:46.866
But the truth is,

16:47.039 --> 16:50.736
this company doesn't wanna commit
its time and resources

16:50.909 --> 16:54.538
to any process that wasn't developed
by one of its stars.

16:54.713 --> 16:56.681
Well, then,
you should blow them off.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.578
What we're talking about
is way too important

16:58.751 --> 17:01.845
to get bogged down
in any company politics.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.147
I know.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.087
Steve.
Just the man I was looking for.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.730
I'm meeting D'Shawn at the gym.
You up for a little two on two?

17:12.897 --> 17:15.366
- No, thanks, I'm not in the mood.
- Come on, lose those blues.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.558
It's a beautiful day, bud.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.067
Yeah, for some people,
but not me, man.

17:19.238 --> 17:22.695
Is this funk because your protégé
didn't get the part?

17:22.875 --> 17:24.433
Brandon, beat it, okay?

17:24.609 --> 17:26.737
Hey, sorry,
didn't mean to hit a nerve, big guy.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.210
But you've been around
show business. What's the big shock?

17:29.381 --> 17:32.942
- Wouldn't you like to know?
- As a matter of fact, I think I would.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.279
Brandon,
you know I love you like a brother,

17:35.454 --> 17:37.979
but isn't it possible
your sister was switched at birth?

17:38.791 --> 17:39.917
What did Brenda do now?

17:40.092 --> 17:42.424
Well, there's a rumor
going around school

17:42.594 --> 17:43.925
about how she really got the part.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.859
Could you be a little more specific?

17:46.031 --> 17:48.659
If I said casting couch, would you
know what I was talking about?

17:48.834 --> 17:51.530
If you mean what I think you mean,
I only have one thing to say.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.398
- And what's that?
- Stop the rumor.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.541
All right. Okay.
But look me right in the eye right now

17:56.708 --> 17:59.199
and tell me Brenda's not capable
of doing something like that.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.339
I rest my case.

18:11.123 --> 18:12.454
So where's Brenda?

18:12.624 --> 18:15.058
Well, she wanted to come,
but she had rehearsal.

18:15.227 --> 18:16.956
She's really excited
about getting the lead.

18:17.129 --> 18:20.098
Yeah, now there's this nasty rumor
going around about her, though.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.028
What kind of rumor?

18:22.201 --> 18:24.032
Well, supposedly,
she slept with the director

18:24.203 --> 18:25.227
to get the part.

18:25.404 --> 18:28.896
- Well, it's obviously not true.
- Of course not.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.699
I'll get it.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.304
- Hey.
- Hi.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.416
Did I miss anything?

18:39.284 --> 18:42.913
- What happened to your rehearsal?
- Oh, it was moved to 4:00.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.161
What's wrong?
Why are you guys acting so strange?

18:52.431 --> 18:54.763
We're...
We're just surprised to see you.

18:55.767 --> 18:57.758
Look, Brenda,
don't take this the wrong way,

18:57.936 --> 19:00.666
but there's a rumor
going around about you

19:00.839 --> 19:02.500
that I think you should know about.

19:04.376 --> 19:05.604
What rumor?

19:05.777 --> 19:08.177
Well, some people are saying
that you slept with Roy Randolph

19:08.347 --> 19:09.814
to get the part.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.815
- That's ridiculous. Who said that?
- I don't know, just some people.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.953
Kelly, who said it?

19:15.287 --> 19:18.745
- I guess I heard it from Steve.
- Yeah, well, that figures.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.290
What else are Steve and Laura
saying about me?

19:21.460 --> 19:23.052
It doesn't matter.
None of us believe it.

19:23.228 --> 19:25.025
It's just gossip.
It doesn't mean anything.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.357
The hell it doesn't.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.566
Jeez, I'm sorry I told you.

19:29.601 --> 19:32.536
You know what, Kelly, Steve is right.
I did sleep with Roy Randolph.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.264
You wanna know why?
Because I have no talent.

19:35.440 --> 19:36.873
- Brenda, stop it.
- No, that's fine.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.771
Have your little party without me.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.419
Well, howdy there, pretty lady.
Is this seat taken?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.184
If I hear
one more Southern-fried accent,

19:55.360 --> 19:57.658
I may just start screaming.

19:57.829 --> 20:00.525
The creative process
taking its toll, Bren?

20:00.699 --> 20:02.724
You have no idea.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.597
Just think about opening night.
All those people cheering for you,

20:05.771 --> 20:08.205
your dressing room
filled with flowers.

20:08.373 --> 20:12.139
Have you ever wanted something
so bad, and then you finally get it

20:12.311 --> 20:15.144
and it turns
into a complete nightmare?

20:17.249 --> 20:21.310
Well, you know what they say.
Be careful what you wish for.

20:23.255 --> 20:28.022
Bren, I know
you didn't sleep with Roy Randolph.

20:29.194 --> 20:33.927
- Who told you?
- It doesn't matter. I know you.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.262
You know, you may be
the only true friend that I have.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.248
Tom, are we moving
to a rehearsal room?

20:53.418 --> 20:55.352
Rehearsal's over.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.556
Eddie, where's Roy?
I need to talk to him.

21:00.726 --> 21:03.559
Mr. Randolph's in his office
and you don't wanna talk to him.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.493
Not after you flaked
on the first day of blocking.

21:06.665 --> 21:08.257
Look, I did not flake.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.401
I got a message
from the Drama Department

21:10.569 --> 21:12.196
saying that the time
had been changed.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.862
Come on. If there's any changes
in the schedule, I do the calls.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.133
No more stories, okay?
It will just make things worse.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.073
There has been a mistake.
Please, just let me explain it to him.

21:20.245 --> 21:21.473
Brenda, I know Roy.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.774
If this were a professional gig
and you were a no-show,

21:23.949 --> 21:26.144
you'd be unemployed
right about now.

21:26.318 --> 21:29.253
You have to accept that he might
drop you because of this.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.549
But you don't understand,
this wasn't my fault.

21:34.726 --> 21:38.526
Okay, okay, okay.
Let me talk to him.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.824
I'll smooth things over.

21:41.433 --> 21:43.924
Just don't let it happen again.

21:53.345 --> 21:54.437
Hey, how did it go?

21:54.613 --> 21:58.310
Hi. Oh, incredible.
I got to do Maggie the whole rehearsal.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.008
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah. Roy loved my ideas.

22:01.186 --> 22:03.017
Really? What happened to Brenda?

22:03.188 --> 22:04.780
Brenda wasn't there.

22:04.956 --> 22:08.153
Somebody called her and told her
that rehearsal was three hours later.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.125
Any idea who that might have been,
Laura?

22:11.697 --> 22:13.494
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:13.665 --> 22:17.192
I can understand that you're upset,
but don't take it out on me.

22:17.369 --> 22:18.529
You're right.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.672
I guess I should start
with my friend Steve here.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.030
Let's go.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.471
What, you gotta go
and spread more rumors about me?

22:24.643 --> 22:26.804
What's next, Steve?
That I slept with Eddie too?

22:27.446 --> 22:29.243
I never said anything
that wasn't true.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.182
I always knew that you were weak.

22:32.718 --> 22:37.314
Brenda, let's get one thing straight.
I'm your brother's friend, not yours.

22:37.489 --> 22:38.513
And that's a relief.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.921
Well, now that you have the part,
choke on it, okay?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.686
One more thing, Laura.

22:43.862 --> 22:47.389
I may have missed rehearsal,
but I am still Maggie.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.258
And you still have nothing.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.128
Except for Steve,

22:53.305 --> 22:56.331
which is kind of the same thing,
I guess now, isn't it?

23:01.747 --> 23:02.771
Where does Brenda get off

23:02.948 --> 23:04.939
pointing that slimy finger of hers
at other people?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.585
I can't believe that Randolph
didn't fire her on the spot.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.381
You can thank Eddie for that.
He's even taking bullets for her now.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.546
Did you notice
that she didn't deny it?

23:12.724 --> 23:14.715
I feel like breaking something,
I swear.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.827
I wish you'd felt that way
when Brenda was around.

23:16.995 --> 23:20.863
Oh, you're tense, sit down.
I'll give you a back rub.

23:21.299 --> 23:24.791
Wow, if you're this tense now,
imagine how Brenda must feel.

23:24.970 --> 23:27.666
Well, there's some consolation
in that.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.268
Too hard?

23:29.441 --> 23:33.275
Too perfect. It's starting to make up
for this abysmal day I'm having.

23:34.012 --> 23:37.641
You know, Randolph said that
my performance was perfect today.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.579
He never said that about Brenda.

23:39.751 --> 23:43.687
Well, maybe that bonehead
will finally realize he made a mistake.

23:43.855 --> 23:47.086
He will.
If I could get more time with him.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.352
I wouldn't count on Brenda
missing any more rehearsals

23:49.528 --> 23:51.155
if I were you.

23:51.329 --> 23:55.459
I don't suppose you could kidnap her
and lock her in a closet?

23:55.834 --> 23:57.597
That's tempting.

23:57.769 --> 24:01.705
How about some little injury,
like a broken finger or a toe?

24:01.873 --> 24:03.773
How about a finger and a toe?
And why stop there?

24:03.942 --> 24:05.910
She's got a jaw
I'd like to plant one on too.

24:06.411 --> 24:10.006
Whatever it takes
to make her miss a few rehearsals.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.810
Of course, you'll have to make it
look like an accident.

24:15.754 --> 24:17.221
Laura.

24:17.823 --> 24:19.085
You aren't serious, are you?

24:19.758 --> 24:23.285
She didn't play fair. Why should we?

24:37.509 --> 24:41.843
- Hey, Bren, you need a ride?
- No, thanks. Go ahead without me.

24:42.814 --> 24:46.341
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.651
Listen, I heard the rumor.

24:52.891 --> 24:54.654
What, was it on the 11:00 news?

24:55.293 --> 24:58.160
No, a special bulletin, I think.
You know, "We interrupt this program

24:58.330 --> 25:01.026
to bring you the latest breaking dirt
on Brenda. "

25:01.399 --> 25:03.094
Brandon, I am not in the mood.

25:04.436 --> 25:06.063
Sorry.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.239
I guess I know
how you must be feeling.

25:10.775 --> 25:12.800
You know what really hurts?

25:13.645 --> 25:17.342
Yesterday, Kelly and I got in a big fight
and Donna was there.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.609
Neither one has even bothered
to call me.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.645
Well, did you call them?

25:22.487 --> 25:24.318
I'm not the one
who needs to apologize.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.918
Look, Brandon, in my entire life,
I've slept with two guys.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.756
Stuart Carson and Dylan McKay.

25:32.330 --> 25:35.663
Why all of a sudden would they believe
that I've become the slut of CU?

25:37.536 --> 25:41.131
Well, Bren,
I'm not saying they're right.

25:41.306 --> 25:45.140
But you've got to admit,
it could look a little peculiar to people.

25:50.181 --> 25:52.411
Tell me the truth, Brandon.

25:52.817 --> 25:54.546
Do you think I slept with him?

25:56.354 --> 25:58.618
Listen, Bren, after my affair
with Lucinda Nicholson,

25:58.790 --> 26:00.849
I've got no business
judging what anyone does

26:01.026 --> 26:02.357
with their personal life.

26:05.096 --> 26:06.586
You're no better than Kelly.

26:07.465 --> 26:09.296
Hey, don't overreact here.

26:09.467 --> 26:12.493
All I'm saying is, it doesn't matter to me
whether you slept with him or not.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.832
You're still my sister.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.030
Oh, well, thanks for your support.

26:23.815 --> 26:25.305
Hello.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.109
Hi, Steve. What do you want?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.115
Steve?

26:31.256 --> 26:33.952
Listen, man, right now isn't a...

26:34.459 --> 26:36.950
Okay, okay, I'll be there.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.400
Thanks for coming, guys.

26:48.573 --> 26:51.906
Steve, I really hope this isn't more grist
for the Brenda rumor mill,

26:52.077 --> 26:54.568
because if it is, I'm not interested.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.976
Me neither. I feel awful.
She was really hurt by us yesterday.

26:58.149 --> 27:00.310
And by me this morning.

27:00.485 --> 27:03.045
Listen, guys, I gotta tell you,
if she did the deed with Randolph,

27:03.221 --> 27:04.813
I don't think she'd be acting like this.

27:04.990 --> 27:08.790
Well, you can all relax. It's not true,
I was wrong. I was way wrong.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.450
Well, what made you change
your mind?

27:10.629 --> 27:11.789
Laura showed her true colors.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.591
I mean, this girl is wacko
with a capital J.

27:14.766 --> 27:17.166
She wants this part so badly,
she crank-called Brenda's house

27:17.335 --> 27:19.030
so she'd miss her first rehearsal.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.399
- Cute.
- Oh, it gets worse.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.200
Now she's trying
to pull a Tonya Harding.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.104
She wants me to put Brenda
out of commission.

27:25.877 --> 27:27.708
She had to have been kidding,
Steve.

27:27.879 --> 27:30.575
You know, that's what I thought
at first too, but she's dead serious.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.376
And so am I, so I walked.

27:32.550 --> 27:34.245
But not before I told her
I would do it.

27:34.753 --> 27:36.118
What?

27:36.287 --> 27:38.380
Hey, if I didn't, I mean,
who knows what this girl

27:38.556 --> 27:40.956
would do herself? We're dealing
with someone whose driveway

27:41.126 --> 27:42.684
doesn't go all the way to the street.

27:42.861 --> 27:45.022
Yeah, I think she needs
to see some professional help.

27:45.196 --> 27:49.030
Yeah. She does, but I feel so badly
about the way I treated Brenda.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.366
Yeah, we all do.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.085
Roy.

28:08.787 --> 28:12.416
Hi. There was no answer at the door.
I'm sorry if I interrupted you.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.616
Well, you have caught me
at rather a peculiar moment.

28:15.794 --> 28:20.128
There is something unnatural about
an Englishman trying to get a tan.

28:20.298 --> 28:24.394
- Well, I won't tell anyone.
- Good.

28:24.569 --> 28:26.366
Please, sit down.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.941
Can I offer you some tea?
A scone? Sun block?

28:31.109 --> 28:32.736
No, thanks.

28:33.144 --> 28:36.443
I really just came to apologize
for missing rehearsal.

28:37.282 --> 28:39.045
Yes, Eddie explained.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.181
I also want you to know
how much it means to me

28:41.352 --> 28:42.478
that you cast me in the lead.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.053
Well, my hands were tied.

28:44.923 --> 28:47.414
You happened to be absolutely
the best actress for the part.

28:48.793 --> 28:51.455
Though I have heard whisperings
of more sordid explanations

28:51.629 --> 28:52.857
as to why you were cast.

28:54.866 --> 28:56.128
Yeah, it's pretty upsetting.

28:56.301 --> 28:58.633
It's upsetting for me too.
When I accepted this job,

28:58.803 --> 29:00.395
they practically made me
put it in writing

29:00.572 --> 29:02.267
that I'd keep my hands
off the co-eds.

29:04.109 --> 29:06.270
Well, I hope you don't get into trouble
for nothing.

29:06.444 --> 29:08.173
Believe me, I'll survive.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.808
I'm more concerned about you.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.413
Theater can be
a dirty, competitive business.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.920
So few parts, so many actors.
There's bound to be sour grapes.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.220
If you plan on a career, I suggest
you start developing a thick skin now.

29:24.729 --> 29:25.787
I'm trying.

29:25.964 --> 29:27.090
And rest easy.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.194
There'll be no more backstage intrigue
on this production.

29:31.369 --> 29:32.836
I'm cleaning house.

29:36.374 --> 29:38.069
Clare is first in her class.

29:38.243 --> 29:42.339
She spends most of her evenings
reading Ezra Pound in our study.

29:42.514 --> 29:47.508
I can't picture her provoking fistfights
with strange men in hotel rooms.

29:48.686 --> 29:51.917
I was there, sir,
and I can barely picture it.

29:52.090 --> 29:55.355
Did someone give her
something to drink at this party?

29:57.929 --> 30:00.591
No, she was just off and running.

30:02.066 --> 30:04.193
And then yesterday,
when she showed up at my house

30:04.369 --> 30:06.633
with two tickets
for us to go to Berkeley...

30:10.008 --> 30:15.844
Well, she seems to have selected me
to help her with her problems.

30:17.782 --> 30:18.806
Her problems?

30:19.851 --> 30:22.877
Well, she was crying a lot
on prom night.

30:26.024 --> 30:27.889
Yes?
I've got to take this call, Brandon.

30:28.059 --> 30:34.191
L... I'll talk to Clare.
I'm sorry if she's been a nuisance.

30:34.465 --> 30:36.899
Hello, Carl. Good of you to call.

30:37.101 --> 30:38.625
No, you're not interrupting anything.

30:38.803 --> 30:41.294
I was just reading the proposal.
It's right here in front of me.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.875
- Hi.
- Clare.

30:51.049 --> 30:53.813
- I thought I might find you here.
- Don't you ever go to school?

30:53.985 --> 30:56.317
Spring semester of my senior year?
Not likely.

30:56.487 --> 31:00.082
Oh, listen, Clare, I wouldn't pack
your bags for Berkeley just yet.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.726
I had a little talk with your father
about prom night.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.626
- You are kidding, aren't you?
- I felt I had to.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.690
I'm sorry.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.929
What are you apologizing to me for?

31:11.102 --> 31:13.127
You're the one that just
shot yourself in the foot.

31:14.439 --> 31:15.497
What are you talking about?

31:15.940 --> 31:18.875
You'll see. Good luck, Brandon.

31:23.147 --> 31:26.742
Oh, Brick, how long
does this have to go on?

31:26.918 --> 31:28.909
This punishment?

31:29.420 --> 31:33.516
Haven't I done enough time?
Can't I apply for a pardon?

31:33.691 --> 31:35.352
Okay, Laura, that's quite enough.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.991
- I was just running some lines.
- I know what you were doing.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.827
And normally, we'd be having
this conversation in private.

31:44.702 --> 31:48.468
But since you have no regard
for my privacy or Brenda Walsh's,

31:48.640 --> 31:51.131
I don't see
why I owe you that respect.

31:53.244 --> 31:56.873
I don't understand.
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:57.048 --> 32:00.916
Please, you are not that good
an actress.

32:01.853 --> 32:04.651
I'm sorry, but you're no longer part
of this production.

32:04.822 --> 32:07.017
So I'd appreciate it
if you gathered up all your things

32:07.191 --> 32:09.421
and left at once.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.214
You bitch.

32:38.389 --> 32:40.220
Get off my stage.

32:52.270 --> 32:54.830
Laura. Laura.

33:02.947 --> 33:06.474
Laura, wait. Laura, listen to me.

33:07.285 --> 33:10.152
No, let go of me.
What was she doing at rehearsal?

33:10.321 --> 33:11.345
Calm down.

33:11.522 --> 33:13.922
- He took the part away from me.
- Laura, it was never yours.

33:14.092 --> 33:15.684
It would have been
if you had helped me.

33:15.860 --> 33:17.225
Why didn't you help me?

33:17.395 --> 33:20.694
Because
Brenda never slept with him.

33:20.865 --> 33:22.423
So now you believe Brenda.

33:24.068 --> 33:26.832
Laura, get a grip on yourself.
You're starting to lose it here.

33:27.438 --> 33:28.803
What?

33:30.408 --> 33:32.342
Oh, now you're saying
that I'm crazy?

33:32.877 --> 33:35.175
Laura, I'm worried about you.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.146
I think you need to talk to someone.

33:37.315 --> 33:39.112
Someone who can help you
through this.

33:39.283 --> 33:41.877
I should have known.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.983
Kids from Beverly Hills.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.855
You're all the same.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.246
All right, I'm here.
What is it that's so important?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.657
Are you aware that Laura Kingman
asked Steve to physically harm you

34:21.826 --> 34:23.521
so that she could have the part?

34:23.694 --> 34:25.321
Yeah, Brandon told me.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.396
Like, what am I supposed to do?
Hire a bodyguard?

34:27.931 --> 34:30.127
Don't worry,
Steve's dealing with her.

34:30.301 --> 34:32.496
Yeah, well, I can really count on Steve,
my good buddy.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.138
Hey, he feels just as bad about this
as we do.

34:35.306 --> 34:38.002
And make no mistake,
we do feel awful.

34:38.176 --> 34:40.143
What exactly is it
that you feel awful about?

34:40.678 --> 34:43.272
That you guys talked about me
behind my back?

34:43.447 --> 34:46.212
Or that you didn't even bother
to ask me whether any of it was true?

34:46.851 --> 34:49.114
Or yesterday,
when I completely lost it at Andrea's,

34:49.286 --> 34:51.380
no one cared enough to see
if I was okay?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.748
I guess, in some way,
all of the above.

34:56.094 --> 35:00.258
Look, Bren, I wanted to call you.
I just didn't know what to say.

35:00.431 --> 35:01.489
I mean, I was embarrassed.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.691
But I guess at the same time,
I was a little put off

35:03.868 --> 35:06.132
because you immediately assumed
we were ganging up on you.

35:06.304 --> 35:10.104
Yeah, when all we were trying to do
was let you know what was going on.

35:12.076 --> 35:14.670
Look, maybe I did overreact.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.240
But I was just completely blown away
by the whole thing.

35:18.683 --> 35:21.083
You know, it was like everyone
was turning me into the cliché

35:21.252 --> 35:23.186
of the desperate woman who,
in order to get ahead,

35:23.354 --> 35:26.414
needs to sleep with every guy
who can do her some good.

35:26.591 --> 35:27.615
Tell me about it.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.525
I guess the truth of the matter is,

35:30.695 --> 35:35.462
I didn't exactly give you guys
a chance to explain yourselves.

35:37.768 --> 35:40.430
What do you say we just forget
this ever happened?

35:41.873 --> 35:44.307
I don't know if I can forget about it.

35:44.675 --> 35:46.199
But at least I know
who my friends are.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.744
Okay.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.756
Oh, hi there. Sorry I'm late.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.450
Did you get stuck in traffic?

36:04.362 --> 36:06.353
No, not exactly.

36:06.764 --> 36:08.698
- We ordered for you.
- Great.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.964
Wanna see my report?

36:11.135 --> 36:13.467
- You finished it already?
- She got inspired.

36:14.772 --> 36:17.104
Your work is really interesting.

36:18.609 --> 36:21.271
I'm glad you got to see the place.

36:21.679 --> 36:25.171
Because it looks like I'm not gonna be
working there anymore.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.914
- What happened?
- I quit.

36:30.288 --> 36:32.153
Good for you.

36:32.456 --> 36:35.323
You quit? Just like that?

36:35.927 --> 36:38.691
It's been building a long time, hon.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.492
I mean, why should I waste
the best years of my life

36:42.667 --> 36:45.158
working for guys that aren't serious
about bioremediation?

36:45.636 --> 36:49.299
- Because they pay you every week?
- They're not the only lab in town.

36:50.141 --> 36:51.472
And from what I saw today,

36:51.642 --> 36:53.701
what this guy's doing
could revolutionize the world.

36:53.878 --> 36:56.438
Anybody would be crazy
not to wanna be in business with you.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.542
I should hire you to be my publicist.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.911
Or maybe Dylan should hire you
to work here.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.445
Have a little faith in your man,
Suzanne.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.749
He's going places.

37:07.491 --> 37:09.789
I have faith in you, Kevin.

37:10.761 --> 37:12.388
Thanks.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.860
Well, I guess that's what I get
for falling in love with a genius.

37:16.367 --> 37:17.891
No.

37:18.469 --> 37:21.529
This is what you get.

37:24.342 --> 37:26.207
Don't worry.

37:27.612 --> 37:28.840
I know what I'm doing.

37:41.859 --> 37:43.952
- Laura?
- Wrong.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.587
That seems to be the pattern for me
these days.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.323
Yeah, Brenda told me
about the blowout

37:49.500 --> 37:50.762
at rehearsal this afternoon.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.829
Words can't convey how ugly it got.

37:54.005 --> 37:56.132
Laura's convinced
that there's a conspiracy against her

37:56.307 --> 37:57.467
and I'm leading the charge.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.803
Well, she'll probably cool off
in a few days.

38:00.511 --> 38:02.172
I just hope she finds a good shrink.

38:02.346 --> 38:04.211
I don't want anything to do with her
anymore.

38:04.382 --> 38:07.647
But after all you've been through,
you can't leave her hanging.

38:08.319 --> 38:09.718
What are you, my conscience?

38:10.621 --> 38:12.646
Well, it's a tough job,
but somebody's gotta do it.

38:13.991 --> 38:15.458
Yeah.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.560
Yeah.

38:18.429 --> 38:19.953
Later.

38:35.413 --> 38:36.880
Laura.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.283
Laura, come on.
If you're in there, we need to talk.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.581
Oh, no.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.749
Oh, my God.

39:20.958 --> 39:23.392
Steve. My God, if you were trying
to scare me, you succeeded.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.325
- I'm sorry, I'm looking for Laura.
- What?

39:26.497 --> 39:28.192
She's in the theater
trying to kill herself.

39:28.366 --> 39:29.560
I just found some suicide note

39:29.734 --> 39:32.396
saying something about
her final performance, come on.

39:35.139 --> 39:36.697
Laura.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.151
Laura.

39:58.028 --> 39:59.052
No one's here.

40:03.200 --> 40:06.101
- Oh, my God.
- What are we gonna do?

40:06.270 --> 40:09.535
There's nothing you,
or anyone else, can do.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.368
This is my stage now.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.908
Laura. Don't do anything
you're gonna be sorry for.

40:14.078 --> 40:17.047
- Come on, please, come down.
- No.

40:17.214 --> 40:20.945
You don't care about me.
You never did.

40:21.118 --> 40:23.018
I do care about you.

40:23.187 --> 40:26.679
Just go away.
At least let me do one thing right.

40:26.857 --> 40:30.657
- Steve, call security.
- Go ahead, both of you.

40:30.828 --> 40:33.661
By the time they get here,
my performance will be over.

40:33.831 --> 40:37.426
- Stay here. I'll be right back.
- Hurry.

40:37.601 --> 40:39.432
Keep her talking.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.546
You wanna watch? Go ahead.

40:50.181 --> 40:52.206
I'm not afraid of an audience.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.248
Look, Laura,
maybe I can talk to Randolph.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.648
You know,
convince him to take you back.

40:58.155 --> 41:01.886
Why would you wanna do that?
I know how much you hate me.

41:02.059 --> 41:03.720
No, I don't hate you.

41:03.894 --> 41:07.489
In fact, I never really felt right
about only one person doing the part.

41:07.665 --> 41:11.101
Look, maybe I can arrange it
so you can do a few shows too.

41:11.268 --> 41:14.760
Thanks. Then everybody
could compare us.

41:14.939 --> 41:16.463
And guess what they would say.

41:17.608 --> 41:19.906
"The understudy is never as good
as the star. "

41:20.077 --> 41:22.568
What about all the other plays,
Laura?

41:22.746 --> 41:24.270
What's to say
that you won't be starring

41:24.448 --> 41:26.439
in the next production
and I'll be your understudy?

41:26.617 --> 41:30.246
Please. I never get what I want.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.080
Somebody else
always knows someone,

41:34.258 --> 41:37.785
or knows how to talk to someone,
or has the right angles.

41:37.962 --> 41:41.489
It's never going to be me. Never.

41:42.933 --> 41:47.495
Laura, it could be.
But not if you go and hurt yourself.

41:47.972 --> 41:51.703
I won't be the one
that's gonna be hurt. No.

41:57.515 --> 42:02.817
When Randolph comes in
and finds me hanging here,

42:03.754 --> 42:05.517
he'll be sorry how he treated me.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.117
- Laura, no.
- No, Steve.

42:09.293 --> 42:10.317
I won't let you do it!

42:10.494 --> 42:11.825
- No!
- I won't let you go.

42:11.996 --> 42:14.692
- Come on, it's gonna be all right.
- No, please.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.560
- No.
- It's all right, it's okay.

42:16.734 --> 42:20.761
Laura, come on, it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

42:20.938 --> 42:23.304
Come on, it's okay.

42:23.941 --> 42:26.432
It's okay. It's okay.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.569
Come on.

42:59.944 --> 43:01.434
You know, if you hadn't been here,

43:01.612 --> 43:04.809
they'd probably be taking her away
in a body bag right now.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.383
Poor Laura.

43:07.551 --> 43:09.212
You know, all day,
I was so angry at her,

43:09.386 --> 43:10.910
and now all I feel is pity.

43:12.356 --> 43:15.757
So do you think you could
stop being angry at me too?

43:17.861 --> 43:19.954
Steve, just leave me alone, okay?

43:20.130 --> 43:22.655
Come on, Brenda, it's over.

43:23.968 --> 43:25.299
Yeah, maybe for you.
