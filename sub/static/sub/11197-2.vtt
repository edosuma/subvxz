00:06.240 --> 00:09.160
Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:09.240 --> 00:13.600
The X-302 will be the first human-built
spacecraft capable of interstellar travel.

00:13.720 --> 00:17.760
Colonel Chekov feels a Russian officer
should be assigned to join SG-1 .

00:17.840 --> 00:19.560
Over my rotting corpse, sir.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.000
- l wanna join you.
- l don't see it happening.

00:22.080 --> 00:24.240
There's an energy build-up
within the gate.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.440
The Tauri are in danger.
They are under attack from Anubis.

00:27.520 --> 00:30.160
We're talking about a blast
2,000 to 3,000 megatons.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.600
- There's worse?
- We have no idea how to stop it.

00:32.720 --> 00:35.520
lf the X-302 fails,
this planet will be destroyed.

00:35.600 --> 00:39.360
Even if we contact the Asgard, there's
a chance they won't be able to help us.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.680
Anubis has grown powerful, but still
only defends a small handful of planets.

00:43.800 --> 00:46.560
lf one of those Stargates
also cannot be contacted...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.480
lt is the origin of the attack.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.040
Mission command,
we missed the window.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.600
We thought we'd compensated for the
energy fluctuations, but apparently not.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.720
We're on our own.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.440
Prepare to meet your doom.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.520
Oh, please.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.560
And now, the conclusion.

01:09.440 --> 01:12.680
Has a real flair for the dramatic,
doesn't he? Very theatrical.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.680
Yeah. Pretty much
all the Goa'uld are like that.

01:15.800 --> 01:19.320
But why wait? Why does the guy show up
a day and a half after this starts

01:19.400 --> 01:22.960
to do his whole
''prepare to meet your doom'' thing?

01:23.080 --> 01:25.920
Maybe he wanted to make sure
it was gonna work.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.000
That'd be embarrassing. ''Nothing can
stop the destruction l bring upon you.''

01:30.080 --> 01:32.640
Then the gate shuts down.
''Oops. Never mind.''

01:32.760 --> 01:37.680
Yeah, well, that didn't happen,
and we only have 54 hours left.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.160
Major, can l see you for a second?

01:40.280 --> 01:44.160
When the gate was connected, a shaped
charge disengaged the wormhole.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.480
- An outgoing wormhole.
- True, but...

01:46.560 --> 01:49.440
- The blast would detonate the gate.
- Wait a minute.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.760
- lf you'd just let me finish...
- You're wrong, but you gave me an idea.

01:53.880 --> 01:57.920
We know certain waves can travel
in both directions through a wormhole.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.320
- Radio signals, for one.
- We call Anubis up and ask him to stop?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.920
''Hey, Anubis, this is your agent.
You're playing it way over the top.''

02:06.040 --> 02:08.320
- ''Can you get serious?''
- You were saying?

02:08.440 --> 02:11.039
We send a massive EM pulse
back through the wormhole,

02:11.160 --> 02:14.160
knock out whatever is making
this happen on the other end.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.840
Will that work?

02:15.920 --> 02:20.320
No. l already thought of it. l didn't mention
it because it is far too problematic.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.160
- More than the gate exploding?
- The iris'd have to be open.

02:23.280 --> 02:27.040
- The gate room's shielded.
- Are you saying it absolutely won't work?

02:27.120 --> 02:29.680
What I´m saying, sir,
is that we have no idea

02:29.800 --> 02:32.240
how much EM would be required
to knock this out.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.320
So let's all just go home.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.040
- How long will it take to set up?
- Four hours, tops.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.720
That's how long you have
to come up with a better idea.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.440 --> 04:00.400
l have tried to connect to this world twice.
lt is the only one which l cannot contact.

04:00.520 --> 04:04.320
Then we must hope that is
the location of the weapon.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.960
I´m coming with you.

04:09.040 --> 04:12.800
lf the Goa'uld truly can be defeated,
then l wish to be a part of it.

04:12.880 --> 04:16.240
You said l could not judge this war,
for l'd yet to fight a battle.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.279
You've trained me. Now let me fight.

04:24.680 --> 04:27.360
- You said you did not doubt me.
- l do not.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.360
Then l will join you.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.280
Be quick.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.280
Very well.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.960
Sirs, l've calculated that opening the iris

04:49.040 --> 04:52.480
will increase the flow of energy
to the gate by at least ten times.

04:52.560 --> 04:57.440
lf this doesn't work, we'll be cutting
half the time before the gate detonates.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.480
No better idea yet?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.240
No.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.120
- You and Dr McKay don't see eye to eye.
- Sir, this has nothing to do...

05:06.240 --> 05:11.920
l believe if this plan has any chance
of working, it's with your cooperation.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.000
Yes, sir.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.720
- l know what I´m doing.
- We are nearing the planet.

05:50.400 --> 05:51.840
It is guarded.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.960
A good sign we have
the correct location of the weapon.

05:55.080 --> 05:56.880
There are rings on the surface.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.200
We must hope to catch any Jaffa
on the ground by surprise.

06:01.320 --> 06:03.880
Right here.

06:03.960 --> 06:08.000
You just wanna be able to
take credit for it when it works.

06:08.120 --> 06:12.720
- For the record... l hate you.
- Well, it can't get any worse, then, can it?

06:12.800 --> 06:15.520
Oh, no. I´m rapidly
working up to ''despise''.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.560
We have to get over
this physical-attraction thing

06:18.680 --> 06:20.480
if we're gonna work together.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.840
l think l can act as though it never existed.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.000
Shall we save the world?

06:26.080 --> 06:28.880
Before l take the credit for this,

06:28.960 --> 06:32.800
shouldn't the EM pulse generator
be pointed at the gate?

06:33.320 --> 06:35.520
You're good. Very good.

06:42.160 --> 06:44.160
Rya'c.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.720
- You remain on board with Shaq'rel.
- Why?

06:48.840 --> 06:53.360
One day, you will be a great warrior.
This day, the danger is too great.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.000
l am prepared to die.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.600
l am not prepared for you to die.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.520
- Two gliders in pursuit.
- How is it possible? Are we not cloaked?

07:09.640 --> 07:12.400
Anubis must now have means
of detecting cloaked ships.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.600
l am decloaking
and diverting power to shields.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.640
- Entering range of surface rings.
- Teal'c.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.720
ls it not equally dangerous on the ship
as it will be on the planet?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.440
Go. l will do my best to return for you.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.520
Come.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.440
Stay close. The forces on the ground
may have been alerted to our presence.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.120
Chel nok

07:54.840 --> 07:57.120
Identify yourselves.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.920
We must move

08:32.200 --> 08:35.080
- That's it.
- We're ready, sir.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.360
Close the blast doors.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.920
Open the iris.

09:12.760 --> 09:19.440
Energy transfer is increasing.
Seven times greater. Eight. Ten.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.480
- Go. Yeah, go.
- Do it.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.880
Activating electromagnetic pulse.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.200
Energy transfer is still increasing.
Look, if this was gonna work...

09:50.800 --> 09:53.360
Close the iris.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.640
We're off line.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.120
She's not gonna be happy
when she wakes up.

10:05.240 --> 10:09.920
- Medical team to the control room.
- She is going to wake up, isn't she?

10:27.080 --> 10:30.080
The path is well-travelled.
We must stay under cover.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.360
Many gliders patrol the skies.

10:32.440 --> 10:35.840
This wound is not small.
You must be in great pain.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.280
Nothing l cannot bear.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.480
You could easily be dead.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.640
l do not understand.
There was at least eight of them.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.000
- Ten.
- How did neither of you get hit?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.800
lt is always more difficult
to hit a moving target.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.520
lt is also helpful to be lucky.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.280
There is little time to waste.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.880
Hi.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.040
And l was just startin' to feel better.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.120
Are you gonna be OK?

11:27.240 --> 11:29.680
At least until the gate explodes, yeah.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.280
Look, l... never meant for anyone
to get hurt, much less you.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.520
lt's OK. We had to try something.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.120
l always wanted to be a pianist.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.440
- Excuse me?
- A concert pianist.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.680
A guy who plays piano in front of people.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.280
Right.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.800
- What'd you think l said?
- Never mind.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.800
l had a not-so-comfortable childhood.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.920
My parents hated each other
and blamed me.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.920
Music was my salvation.
lt had this perfect order for me.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.800
That's nice. Really.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.480
When l was 12,
my teacher told me to quit.

12:09.560 --> 12:14.000
A fine clinical player, he said,
but no sense of the art whatsoever.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.520
- Why are you telling me this?
- I´m just tryin' to bond.

12:19.600 --> 12:23.040
- Why?
- Hospital gowns turn me on.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.600
l thought science would be different
than music, but it's just the same.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.040
lt's just as much
of an art as anything else.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.640
Look, it's not your fault
that the EM pulse didn't work.

12:38.720 --> 12:42.720
You're an artist, Major,
maybe the best l've ever seen.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.000
- I´m just critical because I´m jealous.
- I´m touched. Really.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.480
l wish l had a brilliant plan
to draw for you.

12:50.600 --> 12:55.600
And you're funny, too. Even electrocuted.
Me, l got... l got nothin'.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.920
- You're creepin' me out.
- lt's just self-preservation.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.800
I´m beginning to realise
that I´m not gonna solve this,

13:02.920 --> 13:07.920
and that one of your typically insane ideas
is probably gonna be our best chance.

13:08.040 --> 13:11.640
- How much time until detonation?
- You were right. We cut it in half.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.760
25 hours.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.480
- What now?
- Well, first l thought l'd get dressed.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.720
Right.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.880
Leave.

13:24.960 --> 13:28.960
Right. Do you want me
to hold anything, or...? Yeah.

14:02.480 --> 14:05.360
This weapon is unlike
any Goa'uld design l have seen.

14:05.440 --> 14:09.920
l have seen similar construction. lt seems
to have been built by the Ancients.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.360
Who are they?

14:11.440 --> 14:14.400
An advanced race of beings
who created the Stargates.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.440
- But l thought...
- The Goa'uld steal their technology.

14:17.520 --> 14:22.080
lf this is not Goa'uld technology and
Anubis has merely learned to operate it...

14:22.200 --> 14:24.640
Perhaps he will not be able
to rebuild it quickly.

14:24.720 --> 14:28.640
- But do we have sufficient explosive?
- That is our concern. You remain here.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.640
- But l...
- You are injured.

14:30.720 --> 14:33.080
You will slow our pace
and risk giving us away.

14:33.200 --> 14:37.040
- My symbiote heals me. l can go.
- Rya'c, listen to him.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.120
This is but one of many
battles to be fought.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.440
Remain here until sundown.
We will try to return before then.

14:50.200 --> 14:54.400
lf we encase the gate, it could reduce
the effects of the explosion by 40 per cent.

14:54.520 --> 14:58.800
There isn't time to implement that plan.
lf we detonate the gate ourselves now,

14:58.880 --> 15:01.120
we could reduce the damage
by 20 per cent.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.920
The damage to the atmosphere
would be irreversible.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.640
Any survivors would be stuck
on a world incapable of sustaining life.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.880
So far, we've been unsuccessful
in our attempts to reduce...

15:10.960 --> 15:14.960
- What you thinkin'?
- Besides the fact that they are morons?

15:15.040 --> 15:18.880
What do you think
the little alien guy's doing down there?

15:41.440 --> 15:46.000
- Bet you regret coming here now.
- Can't really look at it that way, can we?

15:46.080 --> 15:48.440
So... what are you doin'?

15:49.400 --> 15:52.320
lt's the stupidest thing,
but it's been bugging me.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.760
- What's that?
- We're inside a mountain.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.480
The gate can't fit through
any of these doors.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.720
- So how did we get it in here?
- Yeah.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.320
The ceiling retracts. Above it is a shaft
that leads to the surface,

16:04.400 --> 16:07.600
and inside is a crane mechanism
that hoisted the gate down.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.760
- lnteresting.
- Yeah.

16:09.880 --> 16:13.440
- Does it go up?
- Moving the gate won't shut it off.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.320
l mean, there is nowhere on Earth that...

16:23.960 --> 16:26.560
l knew you'd think of something.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.880
The shield most likely extends
around the perimeter of the weapon.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
The path.

16:52.440 --> 16:57.600
Just hear me out. All we need
to do is get it far enough away from Earth.

16:57.720 --> 17:01.040
The X-302 can achieve that
without having to enter hyperspace.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.640
- That's crazy.
- We have less than 24 hours.

17:04.720 --> 17:06.640
Two to get the gate to the surface,

17:06.720 --> 17:10.880
four to get it to Peterson and loaded onto
a C-1 7, and two more to fly it to area 51 .

17:10.960 --> 17:13.839
The 7 47 meets us in Nevada,
which leaves us 16 hours

17:13.960 --> 17:16.000
to get the rig mounted and airborne.

17:16.119 --> 17:19.319
And none of this is gonna happen
if we're just standing around.

17:19.400 --> 17:23.680
l think that this is gonna save the planet,
and we are gonna do it.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.760
Move, people.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.960
- Well done, Major.
- lt wasn't all my idea, sir.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.280
- And l dare say it's not done yet.
- Right.

17:33.360 --> 17:35.080
Sir.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.560
You do realise that if this works
we won't have a Stargate any more.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.880
lt did occur to me.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.920
Drop your weapons

18:24.000 --> 18:28.400
Yeah, this is Sergeant Siler.
We're ready. Activate the crane.

18:37.640 --> 18:42.080
l have been instructed by my superiors
to offer you the following compromise.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.800
ln exchange for
your continued cooperation

18:44.880 --> 18:47.840
and full disclosure
of the X-302 technology,

18:47.960 --> 18:51.680
we are willing to facilitate
the use of our Stargate.

18:51.800 --> 18:52.760
Facilitate?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.840
A financial arrangement to be negotiated.

18:57.200 --> 19:00.880
- You want us to rent it?
- A simplistic way of putting it.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.840
The X-302's hyperspace
technology doesn't work.

19:03.960 --> 19:09.120
lt will someday. The reason l am here in
the first place is because my government

19:09.240 --> 19:14.080
is unwilling to incur the expense and risk
of running a Stargate programme.

19:14.200 --> 19:18.680
- We are simply trying...
- Here's the part you don't understand.

19:18.800 --> 19:23.280
Even if - and l stress if - we're able
to successfully dispose of this gate,

19:23.360 --> 19:27.440
there's nothing to stop Anubis starting
all this over again with a second gate.

19:27.560 --> 19:30.240
No one's going to be running
a Stargate programme.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.360
The second gate has to stay buried.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.920
What did you hope to accomplish here?

19:46.040 --> 19:50.080
You thought you could destroy something
created by a god as powerful as Anubis?

19:50.160 --> 19:53.680
He did not create the weapon
and he is not a god.

19:56.120 --> 19:59.600
Your god may have been weak, shol'va.
Mine is not.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.160
lf you know of me,
then you know of our cause.

20:02.240 --> 20:04.520
The Jaffa rebellion grows strong.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.200
All Goa'uld are false gods,

20:07.320 --> 20:11.600
and their only real power comes
from the Jaffa whom they oppress.

20:13.840 --> 20:18.680
The next time you open your mouth to
speak, it will be to answer my questions.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.880
You did not kill all the Jaffa at the rings.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.520
We know there are three of you.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.800
Where's the boy?

20:32.440 --> 20:36.960
Evidence of how desperate
your pathetic little rebellion is.

20:37.800 --> 20:40.480
You bring a boy to fight the war of men.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.440
Or is it something else?

20:47.840 --> 20:51.600
Maybe he's someone to whom
you wish to prove yourself.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.320
Bring me the old man.

20:57.920 --> 21:00.560
Wherever the boy is, he will not escape.

21:00.640 --> 21:03.600
Unlike you, he's of little value to Anubis.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.800
However, on your behalf,
l'll be happy to demonstrate to him

21:07.920 --> 21:10.080
how a real warrior fights...

21:11.120 --> 21:12.800
to the death.

21:18.120 --> 21:20.080
ls there anything else l should know?

21:20.280 --> 21:23.520
There's some concern that the 302s
may not have the fuel capacity

21:23.600 --> 21:26.000
to exit the atmosphere
carrying the Stargate.

21:26.120 --> 21:29.440
- How is that possible?
- The engines were designed for a craft

21:29.560 --> 21:33.680
with an alien inertial dampening system
that reduced its overall mass.

21:33.800 --> 21:35.800
Yes. And?

21:35.920 --> 21:38.800
- You'll be carrying a very heavy load.
- How heavy?

21:38.880 --> 21:43.560
- The gate weighs 64,000lbs, sir.
- That's heavy.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.320
You'll need to reach
an altitude exceeding 180km.

21:46.400 --> 21:51.920
At minimum escape velocity before
l release the gate, or it'll fall back to Earth.

21:52.040 --> 21:55.920
Based on the X-302's rocket-fuel capacity,
even a full burn won't do it,

21:56.040 --> 21:58.560
so the other engines
have to get you partway,

21:58.640 --> 22:01.600
hauling something six times greater
than they were made to.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.200
- Yeah. Carter...
- The whole rig isn't exactly aerodynamic.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.280
Carter I´m not so sure
l want to know any of this.

22:09.360 --> 22:12.640
They're lightening the 302,
but that's why you're going alone.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.040
Believe it or not, every pound counts.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.560
Shouldn't have had that cake.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.280
Wish l could go with you, sir.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.880
Yes, I´m sure you do.
And l find that quite bizarre.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.920
- Anything else?
- lf this works, Jonas really deserves...

22:30.040 --> 22:31.520
What?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.960
- Deserves what?
- l don't know. Something.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.920
He's the one who gave me
the idea to do this.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.200
Sir, he gave up everything
to bring us the naquadria.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.440
The hyperspace generator doesn't work.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.320
That's not his fault.

22:48.480 --> 22:50.720
Good luck, sir.

22:50.840 --> 22:53.440
Hey, what could go wrong, huh?

23:21.000 --> 23:23.200
The prisoners will not speak.

23:23.280 --> 23:27.920
Take them to the rings and
have them transported up to the Ha'tak.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.320
What exactly did you remove?

23:56.440 --> 24:01.040
Weapons, some of the life-support.
There's still more than a day's worth.

24:01.160 --> 24:04.400
Well, if we need more than an hour,
we're all in trouble.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.240
We also took out radar, some of
the safety mechanisms, landing gear...

24:08.360 --> 24:09.680
Excuse me?

24:09.760 --> 24:12.480
We had to accommodate
the clamping system.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.360
Once you re-enter the atmosphere,
you'll have to eject.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.800
After you target the 302
to splash down off the coast of Florida.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.240
- When were you gonna tell me this?
- Just now.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.640
We weren't sure any of this would happen
until five minutes ago.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.360
You're not gonna believe this.

24:31.360 --> 24:32.800
Holy crap.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.680
They're waiting for you.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.080
Good luck.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.920
They're airborne, sir.

25:20.040 --> 25:24.800
Mission Command, we're
approaching separation altitude.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.520
Colonel,
confirming altitude at 10,000m.

25:47.640 --> 25:49.120
Roger that.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.560
This is Mission Command.
You have a go for separation.

25:52.640 --> 25:54.920
Proceeding with separation.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.280
Separation complete.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.120
Good luck, sir.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.200
Stop saying that.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.160
Altitude reaching 30km.

26:20.240 --> 26:24.720
Velocity at Mach 6.
Engaging aerospike engines.

26:35.760 --> 26:38.160
lt's gettin' a little bumpy, Command.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.960
Roger that, Starflight. You're still
too shallow to fire the rocket booster.

26:43.080 --> 26:48.480
l may have been understating things.
lt feels like this thing's falling apart.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.320
Altitude is 42km. He needs to reach 50
before he can fire the main rocket engine.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.160
Command, l've got
a master caution alarm.

27:06.240 --> 27:07.920
Roger that, Starflight.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.120
Losing power.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.680
Starflight, your altitude is only 48km.

27:11.760 --> 27:16.240
Full port engine failure.
Starboard at six zero per cent.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.600
Preparing to ignite rocket booster.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.640
You're still too low, Starflight.

27:23.640 --> 27:28.000
I'm losing velocity, Command.
I´m going to start losing altitude.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.960
Command, please advise.

27:33.680 --> 27:36.320
OK, Starflight, go with main-engine burn.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.840
Roger.

27:44.240 --> 27:47.760
Velocity is 25,000km per hour.

27:47.880 --> 27:53.000
28. He's gotta reach 40 and sustain it
for at least 15 seconds now.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.880
Main-engine burn
at one zero zero per cent.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.520
Velocity approaching 40,000km per hour.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.920
Altitude one two zero kilometres.

28:06.040 --> 28:08.720
Five, six, seven...

28:08.840 --> 28:10.960
Preparing to release the gate.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.160
- Not yet, Starflight.
- I´m burning out here.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.800
All right. That's it. I´m out of gas.

28:26.960 --> 28:30.640
Starflight, your altitude is 130km.

28:30.720 --> 28:35.120
He's not gonna make it. He's slowing.
He had to fire the rocket booster too early.

28:35.240 --> 28:39.280
- lt didn't work?
- He's gonna fall back to Earth, sir.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.440
OK. Got any ideas?

28:51.160 --> 28:53.520
Anybody wanna wish me luck?

28:53.600 --> 28:56.240
We're working on it.

28:58.480 --> 29:04.000
Based on altitude, angle of ascent and
velocity, he'll hit Europe in 35 minutes.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.680
lf he puts the 302 in a nose dive,
he could cut his descent time in half.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.080
- Why?
- He can drop the gate in the Atlantic.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.280
I´m figuring there's time for it
to sink maybe 2,000, 3,000ft.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.240
- Will that do any good?
- lt'll reduce the devastation.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.640
- By how much?
- Not much, sir.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.680
Enough that it's worth a shot, isn't it?

29:58.200 --> 29:59.920
Rya'c.

30:12.520 --> 30:16.320
We can reduce the damage
by dropping the gate into the ocean.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.040
You have to put the X-302
into a nose dive, and...

30:19.120 --> 30:21.920
- What?
- Starflight, it's all we got.

30:22.960 --> 30:26.080
- What about the hyperdrive?
- Colonel, it didn't work.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.480
We just don't know
where it'll send me, right?

30:28.600 --> 30:31.760
Who cares as long as
it's a galaxy far, far away?

30:31.880 --> 30:35.520
He's right. The window formed,
it was just unstable.

30:35.640 --> 30:41.040
We have no idea what would happen if we
opened a window within the atmosphere.

30:41.120 --> 30:44.160
Yeah, well, given the situation...

30:47.320 --> 30:50.400
We're taking it
under advisement. Please stand by.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.440
- Major, l can make a call.
- Do it, sir.

30:53.560 --> 30:58.160
You really are a lunatic. l said you were
an artist, but l haven't slept in three days.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.640
You're creating an interdimensional field

31:00.760 --> 31:04.800
around an already highly-charged
Stargate with an unstable burst of energy.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.920
- l realise...
- What l am suggesting has real benefits.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.520
Maybe it saves a few lives.
lf this works, we save the entire planet.

31:11.640 --> 31:16.080
- What chance do we have of that?
- Maybe we can reduce the risk a little.

31:16.160 --> 31:19.120
- How?
- The instability of the naquadria...

31:19.240 --> 31:22.720
ls relative to the size of the burst
you're trying to extract.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.200
We don't have to send the gate
across the galaxy.

31:25.280 --> 31:29.120
Even a second in hyperspace
potentially gets us millions of miles.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.200
Make the call.

31:32.360 --> 31:37.120
This is General Hammond. l need to
speak with the president immediately.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.920
Altitude seven six kilometres...

31:42.000 --> 31:44.160
and still falling.

31:45.200 --> 31:48.400
OK, we have orders, Starflight.
We're gonna try it your way.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.640
Thank you. Run me through it.

31:50.720 --> 31:53.360
We have to
override the safety protocol

31:53.440 --> 31:56.240
that will cause the 302
to avoid an unstable wormhole.

31:56.360 --> 31:59.040
We think we can increase
the chance of this working

31:59.120 --> 32:01.680
by only activating
the generator for one second.

32:01.800 --> 32:04.800
lt wasn't programmed
to work for such a short time.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.040
Hang on.

32:08.240 --> 32:09.680
Of course. Thank you.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.840
Sir, we're gonna write a new subroutine.
lt'll be ready to upload in a few minutes.

32:13.920 --> 32:18.960
All right, well, in the meantime,
l'll just... keep falling.

32:48.720 --> 32:49.920
Carter.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
We're done. Uploading the new program.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.640
All you'll have to do
is activate the generator.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.000
- Roger that.
- You won't have much time.

32:58.120 --> 33:00.240
- l know.
- Sir, if this works...

33:00.320 --> 33:01.760
l know.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.080
- Sir?
- What?/

33:04.160 --> 33:05.120
Good luck.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.000
Activating hyperspace generator.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.680
Now.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.960
This is Observer One.
Visual confirmation.

33:33.080 --> 33:36.160
The X-302 has entered
the hyperspace window.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.600
Colonel?

33:40.440 --> 33:42.640
Colonel, do you read?

33:46.400 --> 33:50.480
This is Observer One.
There is no sign of a chute.

33:52.400 --> 33:56.320
There is, however,
a light show going on up here.

33:57.320 --> 33:58.880
lt worked.

33:59.000 --> 34:04.480
Deep Space is estimating that the gate
detonated three million miles from Earth.

34:05.520 --> 34:11.040
This is Observer Two. l have a visual
on a chute. Moving in for confirmation.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.800
Mission Command,
the cockpit module is intact.

34:14.920 --> 34:17.360
We are pinpointing splashdown position.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.080
Patching in satellite imagery.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.760
Observer Two,
pararescue team is on the way.

34:25.880 --> 34:30.080
Roger that. Colonel O'Neill
is conscious and waving.

34:41.239 --> 34:46.000
- The gate has shut down.
- Let us hope it is not too late. Look.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.760
Teal'c.

35:04.120 --> 35:06.720
Rya'c Rya'c

35:22.080 --> 35:25.280
So that's it? You're just givin' up,
closin' the shop?

35:25.360 --> 35:29.120
At least until we find a way to defend
ourselves against this kind of thing.

35:29.240 --> 35:33.520
- Shouldn't take you long.
- Yeah, right. l thought you'd be happy.

35:33.640 --> 35:36.880
Hey, l never said
we shouldn't use the Stargate.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.640
Well...

35:41.600 --> 35:44.720
- Let me know if l can help.
- l will. Thanks.

35:47.560 --> 35:51.040
- That means you don't hate me.
- Maybe. Too bad for you.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.720
Why?

35:52.840 --> 35:55.760
l was more attracted to you when l did.

35:56.600 --> 35:58.160
Really?

36:01.160 --> 36:04.400
- Colonel. I´m glad you're OK.
- Thank you, sir.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.960
You know the president
wants to see you in person?

36:07.080 --> 36:11.600
- Yes. We spoke on my way here.
- You can have any assignment you want.

36:11.680 --> 36:14.360
Actually, l've always wanted
to command my own boat.

36:14.440 --> 36:18.480
- The navy?
- No, somethin' a little smaller, with oars.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.800
You deserve it, Jack.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.480
- You sure you wanna take this?
- We're closed for business.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.880
l was supposed to retire five years ago.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.760
We don't know when we can re-establish
the Stargate programme, if ever.

36:35.160 --> 36:39.760
Actually, l just meant it says
''Property of US Air Force'' on it.

36:44.960 --> 36:49.800
l still feel responsible for the teams
stranded offworld, but there is nothing...

36:52.480 --> 36:54.720
Hammond.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.760
We're receiving a communication.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.640
What's up?

37:05.720 --> 37:07.760
Go ahead. They're all here.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.640
General Hammond.

37:09.760 --> 37:10.720
Teal'c

37:10.840 --> 37:16.160
O'Neill. lt's good to hear you are well.
The weapon used by Anubis is destroyed.

37:16.280 --> 37:20.240
- We feared it was too late for the Tauri.
- lt was close there for a minute.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.360
We approach in a cargo ship.
Request permission to land.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.200
- NORAD's aware of their approach.
- Permission granted. Welcome back.

37:27.320 --> 37:28.520
Good job.

37:28.640 --> 37:32.400
lt is in fact Rya'c
who deserves the honour.

37:42.400 --> 37:46.480
Sir, if you don't mind me asking,
what exactly did we give the Russians?

37:46.560 --> 37:50.000
- Good old American dollars, Major.
- You're kidding.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.120
And the plans for the X-302 and 303.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.120
Really?

37:56.240 --> 37:58.240
And one more thing.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.120
- So, l hear you're a pretty good pilot.
- Master Bra'tac taught me well.

38:03.240 --> 38:05.680
l hope to be as good
as my father one day.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.240
Just know that no one is that good.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.640
lt also helps to be lucky.

38:10.720 --> 38:12.880
Don't l know that.

38:13.840 --> 38:18.480
Listen, you sure you don't wanna
stick around for a while, kinda hang out?

38:19.320 --> 38:23.440
Rya'c has chosen to help Bra'tac
spread the word of our cause.

38:25.200 --> 38:27.360
Well, it's good to see you again.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.640
Colonel. Colonel, you got a moment?

38:44.760 --> 38:48.360
Carter told me everything you did
to help out. We all appreciate it.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.880
Thanks a lot. See you later.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.880
Colonel, Dr Jackson is gone.

38:54.840 --> 38:57.040
Yeah, l noticed that.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.920
Not a day goes by when
l don't think about what happened.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.200
l stood by and watched while
he saved my people from disaster.

39:03.280 --> 39:06.320
l should have jumped through the glass,
disarmed the device.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.360
He's gone because l didn't.
You have to live with that. So do l.

39:10.480 --> 39:15.280
You want me to make you feel better?
lt wasn't your fault. l don't blame you.

39:15.400 --> 39:19.120
lf l could go back and change what
happened, l would do that, but l can't.

39:19.240 --> 39:23.280
All l can do is try and change
what happens from now on.

39:23.400 --> 39:27.000
l don't want you to exonerate me,
l just want to be given the opportunity

39:27.120 --> 39:29.480
to prove that l can make a difference.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.920
You wanted to see me, sir?

39:55.000 --> 39:59.360
This is not what you want to hear, but part
of the deal to get the Russian Stargate

39:59.440 --> 40:03.840
involved agreeing to let
one of their officers join SG-1 .

40:05.200 --> 40:08.000
This is the thanks l get
for saving the world again?

40:08.120 --> 40:11.640
I´m sorry, Jack.
You're going to have to live with this.

40:11.720 --> 40:16.360
Sir, can't we just give 'em their own unit?
They'd be happy with that, wouldn't they?

40:16.440 --> 40:18.480
What about SG-1?

40:21.600 --> 40:25.760
Actually, General, l've already
chosen our new team member.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.680
Good luck, Colonel.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.760
Thank you, sir.

40:36.240 --> 40:40.240
- How do l look?
- You might wanna lose the helmet.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.240
- Good guess on the green.
- Thanks.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.360
SG-1 , you have a go.

40:48.440 --> 40:50.400
Thank you, sir.
