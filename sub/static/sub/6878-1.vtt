00:03.629 --> 00:05.046
I believed it all

00:03.629 --> 00:05.046
when I wrote it,

00:05.046 --> 00:07.716
but now I think,

00:05.046 --> 00:07.716
"What a pile of horse shit."

00:07.716 --> 00:09.134
I know you guys

00:07.716 --> 00:09.134
are getting a divorce.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.177
We're not getting a divorce.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.929
Abby! Yes, we are.

00:16.057 --> 00:18.686
They were getting a room.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.688
Jo, I thought you

00:18.686 --> 00:20.688
were coming tonight.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.063
Well, I decided not

00:20.688 --> 00:22.063
to lose the day.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.231
She's opening

00:22.063 --> 00:23.231
another vegan bakery.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.860
Cat has been my editor

00:23.231 --> 00:25.860
for 15 years.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.611

00:25.860 --> 00:27.611

[Delia]

00:27.611 --> 00:30.071
I'm sleeping with my client.

00:30.071 --> 00:31.615
I could get into

00:30.071 --> 00:31.615
serious trouble,

00:31.615 --> 00:33.074
maybe even disbarred.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.743
I was 14, and Kori fed me

00:34.743 --> 00:38.706
pills and drinks

00:34.743 --> 00:38.706
to loosen me up.

00:38.706 --> 00:39.331
We are signing this week.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.082
Let's drive down to Baja.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.251
I'm not over you,

00:41.082 --> 00:43.251
and you're not over me either.

00:43.251 --> 00:45.337
-Everybody knows it!

00:43.251 --> 00:45.337
-Enough! Stop!

00:58.099 --> 00:59.935
What?

00:59.935 --> 01:01.687
Kori is pressing

00:59.935 --> 01:01.687
civil charges.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.690
How does it feel to be

01:01.687 --> 01:04.690
almost Mrs. Delia Beech?

01:04.690 --> 01:05.983
