00:02.463 --> 00:03.424
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.424 --> 00:04.505
I'm poz.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.886
Thomas isn't ready
to date a poz guy.

00:05.886 --> 00:07.758
You can always come to me.
You know that.

00:07.758 --> 00:08.799
She won't notice.

00:08.799 --> 00:09.760
It's Michaela.
Of course she will.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.931
Whatever.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.093
I'm a drunk mother.

00:12.093 --> 00:14.395
I see Nico and Grace
twice a week --

00:14.395 --> 00:15.686
Supervised visits.

00:15.686 --> 00:17.768
I know the best family attorney
in the city.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.939
Thanks.

00:18.939 --> 00:20.231
Any chance
you saw this man?

00:20.231 --> 00:21.522
You need to look
into someone's eyes

00:21.522 --> 00:23.104
to know whether or not
they're telling the truth.

00:23.104 --> 00:24.024
I saw him.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.736
Charles Mahoney
has an alibi.

00:25.736 --> 00:27.698
My team was able
to uncover evidence

00:27.698 --> 00:29.820
concretely placing Charles
at a location

00:29.820 --> 00:31.072
far from the shooting.

00:31.072 --> 00:32.283
Get out.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.454
Get out!

00:33.454 --> 00:36.617
Good night.
Love you.

00:36.617 --> 00:37.658
Really?

00:39.870 --> 00:41.662
That's blanket immunity.

00:41.662 --> 00:43.624
You want someone
to help take her down?

00:43.624 --> 00:44.835
This is the only way I talk.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.928
An anonymous source.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.762
That's all
they would tell me.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.229
Is it you?

01:00.601 --> 01:03.354
Look me in the eye
and say it's not.

01:05.646 --> 01:08.239
Then I can move on.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.324
It's not me.

01:20.911 --> 01:22.203
I'm done, Bonnie.

01:26.167 --> 01:27.798
I'm done.

01:27.798 --> 01:29.510
I could get through it
before

01:29.510 --> 01:32.423
because I thought
it would end, so...

01:32.423 --> 01:35.806
But I can't...do it
anymore.

01:35.806 --> 01:37.097
I'm tired.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.982
I'll find out who it is.

01:41.982 --> 01:43.564
Okay?

01:52.733 --> 01:54.695
Annalise.

01:54.695 --> 01:57.408
Annalise. Wake up.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.541
Wake up.

02:02.082 --> 02:03.624
What time is it?

02:03.624 --> 02:04.875
Frank's back.

02:06.297 --> 02:07.548
So, you love him?

02:09.089 --> 02:10.881
Like a...

02:10.881 --> 02:12.593
brotherly, "We've been
through a lot together,"

02:12.593 --> 02:14.845
kind of love, or...

02:14.845 --> 02:16.347
the real kind?

02:16.347 --> 02:19.430
Why are you here?

02:19.430 --> 02:22.683
That not obvious?

02:22.683 --> 02:23.934
I need you.

02:27.768 --> 02:30.271
What about
when I needed you, huh?

02:30.271 --> 02:33.113
When I called you
over and over again.

02:33.113 --> 02:34.235
I didn't want
to involve you.

02:34.235 --> 02:35.986
Oh, and you're fine
involving me now?!

02:35.986 --> 02:36.777
'Cause I'm in love
with you.

02:36.777 --> 02:38.239
Oh, my God. Stop!

02:38.239 --> 02:39.240
You know
I always have been.
No.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.581
You know,
I don't know anything

02:40.581 --> 02:41.952
about you!
You do.

02:41.952 --> 02:43.494
You were in jail
and you never told me.

02:43.494 --> 02:44.835
I had to hear it
from your father.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.046
I'm sorry for that.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.750
I don't care.

02:49.750 --> 02:51.171
Just leave.

02:51.171 --> 02:51.922
No.

02:51.922 --> 02:52.843
Get out right now.

02:52.843 --> 02:54.465
I got nowhere else to go.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.347
You have yourself to blame
for that, Frank!

02:59.560 --> 03:01.642
I know. Okay?

03:01.642 --> 03:02.643
And I get it.

03:02.643 --> 03:06.477
Just...

03:06.477 --> 03:10.901
I'm scared what I'll do
if I got to be alone tonight.

03:15.656 --> 03:16.987
It's Bonnie.

03:16.987 --> 03:18.239
Answer it.

03:25.956 --> 03:26.877
Hi.

03:26.877 --> 03:28.789
Is he there?

03:28.789 --> 03:30.961
Laurel.

03:30.961 --> 03:31.882
Yes.

03:35.296 --> 03:38.429
Are you safe?

03:38.429 --> 03:39.760
Yes.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.472
Are you sure?

03:41.472 --> 03:43.053
I'm fine.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.145
Good.

03:45.145 --> 03:46.807
You tell that bastard
that if he comes

03:46.807 --> 03:50.150
anywhere near this house,
I'll shoot him.

03:50.150 --> 03:52.613
Tell him, Laurel.
I need to hear you say it.

03:52.613 --> 03:54.985
He just wants to talk.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.407
Is that Annalise?

03:56.407 --> 03:57.858
Give me the phone.

03:57.858 --> 03:58.909
No, he doesn't get
to talk to me.

03:58.909 --> 04:00.411
Give me the phone,
Laurel.

04:00.411 --> 04:02.863
Keep him there or he's dead.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.290
What'd she say?

04:11.081 --> 04:12.252
I'm going over there.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.674
Frank, please, stop.

04:13.674 --> 04:15.586
Frank, please.
I said stop.

04:15.586 --> 04:18.048
She said
she'd kill you.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.805
Would that really be
so bad?

04:28.849 --> 04:31.061
You say
you love me, right?

04:33.193 --> 04:35.696
Then come back inside.

04:52.623 --> 04:54.675
It was the fastest
hookup of my life.

04:54.675 --> 04:56.837
That happened on top
of my $400 duvet.

04:56.837 --> 04:57.798
I'll wash it tonight.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.009
No, you'll buy me
a new one.

04:59.009 --> 05:00.631
Or better,
get an apartment

05:00.631 --> 05:02.473
where you can soil
your own linens.

05:02.473 --> 05:03.474
Wait,
soil as in, like...

05:05.015 --> 05:05.926
You're obsessed
with gay sex.

05:05.926 --> 05:07.428
No, I just find it
interesting.

05:07.428 --> 05:08.929
Also, can we take a moment
to enjoy the fact

05:08.929 --> 05:10.931
that I get to cross gay wedding
off my bucket list again?

05:10.931 --> 05:12.062
It was just sex. Relax.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.143
It wasn't just sex.

05:13.143 --> 05:14.815
It was sex with a boy
that broke your heart.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.568
Thank God I know how
to separate sex from feelings.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.779
Even with Oliver?

05:19.490 --> 05:20.441
Whoa.

05:20.441 --> 05:22.032
Your mom's calling.

05:27.448 --> 05:28.789
You're driving.
Why?

05:28.789 --> 05:30.871
So Asher and I can screw
in your back seat

05:30.871 --> 05:32.332
and leave you
to clean it up.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.454
Yes, please.

05:36.797 --> 05:41.462
I thought all you young people
were addicted to your phones.

05:41.462 --> 05:42.553
My battery died.

05:42.553 --> 05:43.884
What's wrong?

05:43.884 --> 05:46.427
You just received
your first subpoena.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.932
It's a closed hearing.

05:51.932 --> 05:53.273
I have to take the stand

05:53.273 --> 05:55.816
and say I saw Charles
that night.

05:55.816 --> 05:57.317
Are you surprised?

05:57.317 --> 05:58.979
His lawyer's trying
to get your testimony

05:58.979 --> 06:00.531
thrown out
before the trial.

06:00.531 --> 06:01.612
They can do that?

06:01.612 --> 06:03.574
If they present
a solid alibi --

06:03.574 --> 06:05.696
his cell records,
security footage.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.578
An actual person
that he's paid off

06:07.578 --> 06:09.199
to say that they
were with him.

06:09.199 --> 06:10.991
It's what you said.

06:10.991 --> 06:13.203
I can just claim I saw a guy
who looked like Charles.

06:13.203 --> 06:14.705
So he goes free
and the prosecutor

06:14.705 --> 06:15.706
looks into your life?

06:15.706 --> 06:16.877
Then what do we do?

06:16.877 --> 06:17.838
Find the alibi.

06:17.838 --> 06:19.339
How?

06:23.554 --> 06:24.505
Tell me.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.640
Where is he?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.649
Oh, sorry.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.326
What's up?

06:46.326 --> 06:48.909
Annalise needs your help.

06:54.795 --> 06:56.036
He was there all night?

06:56.036 --> 06:57.708
Yeah.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.129
Why didn't you
call me?

06:59.129 --> 07:00.711
I didn't
want to worry you.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.842
Now I am worried.

07:01.842 --> 07:03.003
Why?

07:05.506 --> 07:06.967
Oh, my God.

07:06.967 --> 07:07.888
Tell me nothing happened.

07:07.888 --> 07:10.891
Of course
nothing happened!

07:10.891 --> 07:12.392
You have to
trust me right now.

07:12.392 --> 07:13.393
I do.

07:13.393 --> 07:14.975
I just...

07:14.975 --> 07:16.436
I don't trust him.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
No one does.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.649
Annalise does.

07:18.649 --> 07:20.691
Otherwise, why is she
using him to help us?

07:20.691 --> 07:22.983
Because she
is protecting you.

07:22.983 --> 07:24.945
Okay? That's all
any of us want.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.450
What?

07:30.450 --> 07:31.952
Did you tell him
about us?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.498
No, I don't care
what he thinks.

07:41.131 --> 07:42.713
How is Charles
doing in prison?

07:42.713 --> 07:44.545
Why haven't you released
the name of his alibi?

07:44.545 --> 07:46.386
I never said his alibi
was a person.

07:46.386 --> 07:48.799
So -- So
it's not a person?

07:48.799 --> 07:50.801
You'll know more
after tomorrow's hearing.

07:50.801 --> 07:51.892
It'll be worth the wait.

08:05.365 --> 08:06.737
It's a 24-hour bug.

08:06.737 --> 08:08.869
She'll be back
in class tomorrow.

08:08.869 --> 08:09.700
Thank you.

08:09.700 --> 08:10.911
Frank?

08:10.911 --> 08:12.743
He'll call
once he finds something.

08:15.415 --> 08:16.747
What?
You have a better plan?

08:18.749 --> 08:19.620
Exactly.

08:21.461 --> 08:23.333
Is that him?

08:23.333 --> 08:24.084
No.

08:24.084 --> 08:26.216
President Hargrove's office.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.091
Divorce papers.

08:31.091 --> 08:32.843
Raul served me here
yesterday.

08:32.843 --> 08:36.637
He wants full custody,
the house, spousal support,

08:36.637 --> 08:38.689
and if I don't comply,

08:38.689 --> 08:40.520
he's threatening
to take things public.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.442
Didn't I give you
Nina's number?

08:42.442 --> 08:45.355
She said the fact
that I pled guilty

08:45.355 --> 08:48.358
to reckless endangerment
of my kids

08:48.358 --> 08:50.490
makes it nearly impossible
to challenge this.

08:50.490 --> 08:51.491
You pled guilty?

08:51.491 --> 08:53.323
In order to keep
the file sealed.

08:53.323 --> 08:55.616
I didn't want the board
to find out.

08:55.616 --> 08:57.748
'Cause you're afraid you
would be judged by one mistake

08:57.748 --> 09:00.330
instead of the entirety
of your hard-fought career.

09:08.258 --> 09:11.011
What do you need?

09:11.011 --> 09:14.554
Tell me what you would do.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.176
If Nina's as good
as you say

09:16.176 --> 09:18.178
and even she thinks
I should settle...

09:20.180 --> 09:21.602
You'll defend me
if I kill him?

09:21.602 --> 09:24.945
Mm.

09:24.945 --> 09:26.446
All right,
I'll read this

09:26.446 --> 09:29.650
and see if I can find
an alternative.

09:29.650 --> 09:32.192
Thank you.

09:32.192 --> 09:34.454
Hey, Oli.
I got you a present.

09:34.454 --> 09:37.247
Just a little something
to show you how much I care.

09:37.247 --> 09:37.998
Uh...

09:37.998 --> 09:39.369
I'm kidding.

09:39.369 --> 09:43.624
I told the delivery guy
I'd bring them to you.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.085
Aww, you got bae flowers.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.917
That's so sweet.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.089
Those aren't from me.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.975
Secret admirer?

09:54.975 --> 09:58.018
Thomas.

09:58.018 --> 09:59.179
"I know
this probably won't work,

09:59.179 --> 10:00.140
but I'm begging
for another chance.

10:00.140 --> 10:02.142
A million ironic sorries --
Thomas."

10:02.142 --> 10:05.395
Yeah, he's right.
It won't work.

10:05.395 --> 10:08.528
Hey, since Annalise is sick,
do you maybe want to go...

10:10.190 --> 10:11.361
Go fishing?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.402
Go spelunking?

10:12.402 --> 10:13.573
What?

10:13.573 --> 10:15.996
Yeah, spelunking you
sounds perfect.

10:17.407 --> 10:19.119
Connor, we have to go.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.120
I think I'm gonna skip
arbitration.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.241
Bonnie needs us
at the house.

10:21.241 --> 10:22.743
Is something going on?

10:22.743 --> 10:25.796
Sure that Annalise just wants
to yell at us some more.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.668
I'll come by later?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.209
Yeah, sure.

10:29.209 --> 10:31.301
You're having feelings.
Stop it.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.425
Sucks, right?

10:35.425 --> 10:37.137
You can penetrate him,
but never their inner circle.

10:39.309 --> 10:41.101
Frank's the one
that started this!

10:41.101 --> 10:43.393
I know, and now he's going
to help us get out of it.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.145
Do you have any idea how insane
you sound right now?

10:45.145 --> 10:46.476
No one is saying
all is forgiven.

10:46.476 --> 10:47.898
That's exactly
what you're saying.

10:47.898 --> 10:49.149
Yeah, it's good to know,
actually,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.650
that we're allowed
to shoot each other's fathers

10:50.650 --> 10:51.902
and still get
to stay in the cult.

10:51.902 --> 10:52.943
You're missing the point.
Do not stick up

10:52.943 --> 10:54.484
for your boy toy
right now.

10:54.484 --> 10:56.446
Seriously, you guys probably
went on some murder spree

10:56.446 --> 10:58.198
and -- and banged
on top of a corpse.

10:58.198 --> 10:59.830
Okay, can we all just focus on
what's important right now?

10:59.830 --> 11:00.741
Finding the alibi.

11:00.741 --> 11:01.742
If anyone can do that,

11:01.742 --> 11:02.743
it's the Beard.

11:02.743 --> 11:04.785
He doesn't have a beard anymore.

11:04.785 --> 11:05.786
What?

11:05.786 --> 11:07.127
We need to stall the hearing

11:07.127 --> 11:08.548
so Frank has time
to find the alibi.

11:08.548 --> 11:09.880
Fine.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.381
Do it.

11:11.381 --> 11:12.382
We're in the middle
of midterms.

11:12.382 --> 11:13.754
Yeah.

11:13.754 --> 11:15.756
He was the one stupid enough
to lie to the police.

11:15.756 --> 11:17.097
He can save
his own ass for once.

11:20.510 --> 11:21.561
Asher.

11:21.561 --> 11:24.264
Wes needs our help.

11:26.106 --> 11:27.607
Don't come crying to me
when you fail out.

11:27.607 --> 11:28.939
Or die.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.022
You never know
around here.

11:34.024 --> 11:35.816
Does Frank really not
have a beard?

11:35.816 --> 11:37.277
Think of stall tactics --

11:37.277 --> 11:39.239
grounds to challenge
the subpoena

11:39.239 --> 11:41.411
or a motion
to disclose the alibi.

11:41.411 --> 11:43.413
Uh, Oli could hack
the Mahoneys' lawyer.

11:43.413 --> 11:44.494
Or I could call my father.

11:44.494 --> 11:46.036
He could track
their phone calls.

11:46.036 --> 11:47.247
Frank is finding
the alibi.

11:47.247 --> 11:49.289
We need to focus on ways
to delay the hearing.

11:49.289 --> 11:50.831
How about
my medical records

11:50.831 --> 11:52.212
from when I was
at the psych ward?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.713
If Charles' lawyers knew,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.926
they'd want me to do
a psych eval before I testify.

11:55.926 --> 11:57.597
No, we're not giving
your medical records

11:57.597 --> 11:59.219
to the people who want
to discredit you.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.011
It buys us time.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.102
Go.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.012
Room 512.

12:42.012 --> 12:44.094
You want to change
your life,

12:44.094 --> 12:48.148
or are you happy just to stay
Annalise Keating's bitch?

13:04.114 --> 13:05.705
If they're meeting
this close to the hearing,

13:05.705 --> 13:07.367
she has to be the alibi.

13:07.367 --> 13:09.039
Who is she?

13:09.039 --> 13:10.540
Frank said she worked
for the family

13:10.540 --> 13:13.083
during Charles' first trial.

13:15.415 --> 13:18.678
What?

13:18.678 --> 13:21.681
She's the one
who gave Frank the money.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.556
I told him to follow her.

13:29.229 --> 13:31.481
If we want him
to take care of it...

13:34.194 --> 13:36.436
She took your son
from you, Annalise.

13:45.785 --> 13:47.407
They don't mean it,
Connor and Michaela.

13:47.407 --> 13:48.578
They're just scared.

13:48.578 --> 13:52.452
It's fine.

13:52.452 --> 13:55.585
The only person whose opinion
I care about is right here.

13:58.919 --> 14:00.130
So, I was right.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.387
If she's the reason
that you wanted to break up,

14:07.387 --> 14:08.468
you should've
just said that.

14:08.468 --> 14:09.389
No, Meggy,
it happened after --

14:09.389 --> 14:10.060
Please.

14:12.562 --> 14:15.775
Mr. Gibbins.
Your records.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.323
Um...I was a patient here
last year.

14:23.323 --> 14:24.824
I don't care.

14:27.577 --> 14:29.369
Just go.

14:47.057 --> 14:48.428
What?

14:48.428 --> 14:50.060
Uh, nothing.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.222
Just
last I heard, uh,

14:52.222 --> 14:53.773
Frank killed Wes' dad,

14:53.773 --> 14:55.976
and now he's working
for A.K. again,

14:55.976 --> 14:58.188
so do we like Frank --
do we not?

14:58.188 --> 14:59.279
I'm just kind of lost.

14:59.279 --> 15:01.861
Go home.
Study for your midterms.

15:03.323 --> 15:05.695
No.

15:05.695 --> 15:07.077
I'm all about the team.

15:07.077 --> 15:09.239
"We're ducks,
and ducks fly together."

15:09.239 --> 15:11.581
It's "Mighty Ducks."
It's a great movie.

15:11.581 --> 15:13.453
Asher, I'm telling you,

15:13.453 --> 15:15.245
Michaela and Connor
weren't wrong to leave.

15:16.706 --> 15:19.129
BonBon, if something bad's
about to happen --

15:19.129 --> 15:21.881
Something bad's always
about to happen in this house.

15:21.881 --> 15:22.922
Go home.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.428
You got
your medical records?

15:28.428 --> 15:30.220
Yeah.

15:37.857 --> 15:39.319
Messenger
just dropped this off.

15:39.319 --> 15:40.150
No sender.

15:47.527 --> 15:48.738
The Mahoneys
filed a motion

15:48.738 --> 15:51.121
challenging Wes' competency
as a witness.

15:51.121 --> 15:53.533
Hearing was pushed today
so Wes can sit for a psych eval

15:53.533 --> 15:55.165
before he testifies.

15:55.165 --> 15:57.457
And you're
telling me this why?

15:57.457 --> 16:01.251
Because I know you slipped
the defense his medical records.

16:01.251 --> 16:05.045
That's quite an accusation.

16:05.045 --> 16:08.298
I'll keep this one
to myself.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.390
But any more interference
on my case,

16:10.390 --> 16:12.722
and I'll have to report it
to the Disciplinary Board.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.224
As long as you're okay
with me reporting

16:14.224 --> 16:15.935
that you broke privilege
by telling me

16:15.935 --> 16:17.597
your client
has mental-health issues.

16:19.939 --> 16:22.362
We both want
to protect the boy.

16:22.362 --> 16:23.443
Let me do that.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.250
Is Frank still watching her?

16:43.833 --> 16:45.545
Tell him to do nothing.

16:45.545 --> 16:46.626
I mean it.

16:46.626 --> 16:49.049
If he hurts anyone else,
I'll turn us all in.

16:51.631 --> 16:53.473
Annalise
slapped a judge this time,

16:53.473 --> 16:55.135
and she needs
to blackmail him?

16:55.135 --> 16:57.347
Or -- Or she --
she killed Nate,

16:57.347 --> 16:59.519
and she needs you all to help
lift his incredibly buff body?

16:59.519 --> 17:01.981
Or she --
Or we don't talk
about Annalise

17:01.981 --> 17:03.483
while your penis
is staring at me.

17:03.483 --> 17:04.984
Sorry.

17:04.984 --> 17:06.276
I'm flattered.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.528
It's been what --
like 10 minutes?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.450
Is it about Wes?

17:10.450 --> 17:13.113
Oh, my God.
Because he's been missing
a lot of class lately.

17:13.113 --> 17:14.864
Do you want
to know the truth?

17:14.864 --> 17:17.497
Wes and Annalise are working
some crazy court case

17:17.497 --> 17:18.658
in New York.

17:18.658 --> 17:20.920
She asked for our help,
and I said no for once,

17:20.920 --> 17:24.544
because I'm working
really hard at...you know,

17:24.544 --> 17:28.088
trying to stay in the bubble
of -- of work and school

17:28.088 --> 17:31.471
and...you know, this.

17:32.632 --> 17:33.883
Turn around.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.349
What's the court case
about?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.810
Because, I mean, if Wes
needs our help for him --
Oli.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.482
He has enough people
worrying about him.

17:42.482 --> 17:43.893
Otherwise Annalise
would've called you

17:43.893 --> 17:44.894
and made you
go over there today, too,

17:44.894 --> 17:45.895
but she didn't, so...

17:45.895 --> 17:47.987
Or that's her right now.

17:51.901 --> 17:53.613
You already have
Thomas' photo on your phone?

17:53.613 --> 17:55.245
That's before I realized
he's a jerk.

17:55.245 --> 17:57.247
Clearly doesn't know
when to quit.

17:57.247 --> 17:59.249
I don't blame him.

17:59.249 --> 18:01.751
He got a taste,
and now he wants seconds.

18:01.751 --> 18:03.503
Just like me.

18:04.754 --> 18:06.166
Okay, bossy pants.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.338
Look, you're the one
raring to go down there.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.709
I'm just --
I'm being helpful.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.552
We found a way
to help Wes.

18:12.552 --> 18:14.134
How nice.

18:14.134 --> 18:17.347
Yeah, if we don't get
arrested or killed first.

18:17.347 --> 18:19.018
That would be bad.

18:19.018 --> 18:20.770
Okay.

18:20.770 --> 18:22.352
How can you focus
on school right now?

18:22.352 --> 18:23.723
♪ I used to be a social man
most nights ♪

18:27.066 --> 18:28.398
You're a sensitive person,

18:28.398 --> 18:30.360
so you care about Wes,
what happens to him.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.941
Yeah.

18:31.941 --> 18:33.693
You're only that way
because you grew up in a family

18:33.693 --> 18:35.235
that was nice to you.

18:35.235 --> 18:36.946
That's not an accurate statement
about my parents,

18:36.946 --> 18:38.538
and what are you saying?

18:38.538 --> 18:41.291
That it's your parents' fault
that you're...being cold?

18:41.291 --> 18:42.912
I'm not cold.

18:42.912 --> 18:45.205
I'm putting myself first.

18:45.205 --> 18:46.246
Okay.

18:46.246 --> 18:48.878
Is that something
your mom taught you,

18:48.878 --> 18:50.340
to put yourself first?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.213
Okay.

18:53.213 --> 18:55.595
What do you want to know?

18:55.595 --> 18:56.716
Everything.

18:56.716 --> 18:59.639
But first thing is,
why did she call?

18:59.639 --> 19:01.181
I don't know.

19:01.181 --> 19:03.853
I deleted the voicemail.

19:03.853 --> 19:05.815
Our relationship
is complicated.

19:05.815 --> 19:08.478
Like my dad and me?

19:08.478 --> 19:09.269
This is different.

19:09.269 --> 19:09.979
Is it?

19:09.979 --> 19:11.271
'Cause, you know,

19:11.271 --> 19:13.943
sometimes I wish that
he would leave me a voicemail,

19:13.943 --> 19:16.115
but, oh, right,
he's dead.

19:16.115 --> 19:20.450
If I pick up the phone,
she's gonna ask me for money,

19:20.450 --> 19:23.783
or to give legal advice
to some meth-y cousin

19:23.783 --> 19:25.835
I never even knew I had.

19:25.835 --> 19:27.957
Or maybe
she's dying of cancer

19:27.957 --> 19:29.168
and just wants to say
goodbye.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.960
I said goodbye...

a long time ago.

to keep annoying me?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.601
I'm good.

19:41.601 --> 19:44.434
Wouldn't mind
a little head rub, though.

Do you ever think
about hurting yourself?

19:59.619 --> 20:00.620
No.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.031
Have you ever
intentionally

20:02.031 --> 20:03.493
caused physical harm
to another person?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.124
No.

20:05.124 --> 20:06.996
Have you ever heard voices
that others can't hear?

20:06.996 --> 20:07.957
Are you gonna
take Frank back?

20:10.129 --> 20:11.040
So, that's a yes.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.041
I didn't say that.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.212
Didn't say no.
No.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.294
I don't believe you.

20:14.294 --> 20:15.755
Well, that's your right.

20:15.755 --> 20:18.047
He's responsible
for you losing your baby.

20:18.047 --> 20:20.219
And you killed Sam!

20:28.107 --> 20:30.019
I'm tired.

20:30.019 --> 20:31.981
So am I.

20:35.355 --> 20:36.406
How's Laurel?

20:40.119 --> 20:42.121
Did she tell you?

20:42.121 --> 20:44.454
She didn't need to.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.289
I'm glad you have her.

20:49.289 --> 20:51.080
Me too.

20:59.469 --> 21:01.641
Night.

21:01.641 --> 21:02.882
I'm going to bed.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.847
Annalise.

21:07.847 --> 21:10.059
It's Frank.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.192
Put it on speaker.

21:14.564 --> 21:15.735
Hey.

21:15.735 --> 21:17.447
Check your e-mail.

21:22.992 --> 21:24.744
Frank, where are you?

21:24.744 --> 21:26.666
In her house.

21:28.167 --> 21:30.750
Her name's Lisa Cameron.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.622
She's got a kid --

21:32.622 --> 21:33.873
Madison.

21:33.873 --> 21:35.375
I sent you some photos.

21:39.419 --> 21:40.840
You need to leave.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.092
This is
what Annalise needs, Bon.

21:43.092 --> 21:44.133
Frank.

21:44.133 --> 21:46.055
It's an eye for an eye.

21:46.055 --> 21:49.268
Frank, if you go anywhere near
that woman or her child,

21:49.268 --> 21:51.641
I'll send the police
right to your ass.

21:51.641 --> 21:53.062
Annalise.

21:53.062 --> 21:54.273
You hear me?

21:54.273 --> 21:55.485
No more blood.

21:57.857 --> 22:00.239
Promise me, Frank.

22:01.741 --> 22:03.493
I want two stories.

22:03.493 --> 22:06.446
Mommy will do her best,
but I get to pick which ones.

22:06.446 --> 22:07.787
Frank?

22:09.038 --> 22:10.119
No.
Hey.

22:21.631 --> 22:22.592
You promised two stories.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.384
Oookay.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.635
We'll finish this one,

22:25.635 --> 22:27.767
and then it's to bed
for both of us.

22:29.519 --> 22:32.892
So, "He huffed
and he puffed

22:32.892 --> 22:35.024
and he puffed
and he huffed,

22:35.024 --> 22:39.148
and at last,
he blew the house down.

22:39.148 --> 22:42.191
The third little pig met a man
with a load of bricks."

22:55.835 --> 22:57.417
Annalise, I need you
to stay calm.
Is he dead?

22:57.417 --> 22:58.628
Is he dead?

23:20.940 --> 23:22.321
Take him!

23:52.602 --> 23:54.353
What?

24:05.485 --> 24:06.986
Munchies?

24:06.986 --> 24:08.828
Menopause.

24:08.828 --> 24:09.989
Mm.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.453
Will that be all?

24:16.335 --> 24:17.837
Ma'am?

24:24.043 --> 24:24.794
Hello?

24:24.794 --> 24:26.215
Hey.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.847
Where are you?
I just snuck out.

24:57.076 --> 24:58.668
I didn't do anything.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.212
Tell Annalise.

25:06.465 --> 25:07.967
Bon?

25:09.338 --> 25:10.590
Go back inside.

25:12.181 --> 25:14.343
You were right.

25:14.343 --> 25:17.266
This is what she needs.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.638
Frank?

25:24.694 --> 25:25.565
Is that him?

25:27.647 --> 25:29.779
He left. They're fine.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.201
Good.

25:32.201 --> 25:33.913
Here's an actual fix.

25:37.156 --> 25:39.789
I'm
a court-ordered psychologist.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.121
This is a non-confidential
evaluation,

25:42.121 --> 25:44.213
which means
I am legally bound

25:44.213 --> 25:47.086
to report my findings
to all parties involved.

25:47.086 --> 25:49.298
Your attorney is present
to advise you

25:49.298 --> 25:52.471
of any legal ramifications
of certain questions.

25:52.471 --> 25:54.263
Understood?

25:54.263 --> 25:55.595
Yes.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.677
Good.

25:57.677 --> 26:00.730
Have you ever wanted
to hurt someone?

26:00.730 --> 26:03.562
Physically? No.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.645
Just emotionally?

26:06.776 --> 26:08.778
We all get mad at people.

26:08.778 --> 26:10.990
I'd say
that's pretty normal.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.323
Do you always
tell the truth?

26:16.075 --> 26:18.828
That'd be impossible.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.200
Did you tell the truth
about seeing Charles Mahoney

26:21.200 --> 26:23.252
on the street that night?

26:23.252 --> 26:26.916
Yes, I would never lie about
something as important as that.

26:26.916 --> 26:29.128
Do you feel
like you have

26:29.128 --> 26:30.840
a good support system
in place?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.471
I do.

26:32.471 --> 26:33.422
What's wrong?

26:33.422 --> 26:34.974
Nothing.

26:34.974 --> 26:37.056
I just need to talk
about Wes.

26:37.977 --> 26:40.219
Yeah, he, uh,
told me you knew.

26:40.219 --> 26:41.180
It's our lives,

26:41.180 --> 26:43.432
and you can only have
so much say.

26:43.432 --> 26:46.315
Laurel, I'm happy
for the two of you.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.937
I just need your help.

26:47.937 --> 26:49.398
On a scale of 1 to 10,

26:49.398 --> 26:50.990
10 being the highest,

26:50.990 --> 26:52.942
how would you rate
this support system?

26:52.942 --> 26:55.404
10.

26:55.404 --> 26:57.406
I've never felt
more cared for in my life.

26:57.406 --> 26:59.328
Annalise send you?

26:59.328 --> 27:01.080
No.

27:04.163 --> 27:06.085
I heard you're working
for the D.A. now.

27:06.085 --> 27:08.087
I'm not getting involved
with whatever this is.

27:08.087 --> 27:10.800
Even if it's for Wes?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.251
Please.

27:12.251 --> 27:13.923
He's in trouble.

27:16.095 --> 27:18.718
That concludes
the evaluation.

27:18.718 --> 27:20.349
Any questions for me, Wes?

27:22.601 --> 27:24.063
Did I pass?

27:26.976 --> 27:27.977
How'd it go?

27:29.939 --> 27:31.941
I've been cleared
to testify.

27:31.941 --> 27:34.033
Yeah!

27:34.033 --> 27:35.154
I knew our boy
wasn't cray-cray.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.784
The State calls Wes Gibbins
to the stand.

27:51.961 --> 27:55.384
Please raise your right hand.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.386
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the whole truth

27:57.386 --> 27:58.297
and nothing but the truth?

27:59.468 --> 28:01.010
I do.

28:06.565 --> 28:08.728
Why did you approach
Wallace Mahoney that night?

28:11.230 --> 28:12.361
I was lost.

28:12.361 --> 28:14.273
I needed directions.

28:14.273 --> 28:16.695
Did you see anyone
before you crossed the street?

28:18.027 --> 28:19.658
Yes.

28:19.658 --> 28:21.871
He's the gentleman
sitting right there.

28:21.871 --> 28:23.993
Let the record show
that the witness

28:23.993 --> 28:26.705
has identified the defendant,
Charles Mahoney,

28:26.705 --> 28:29.588
as being present at the scene
just prior to the shooting.

28:29.588 --> 28:30.499
No further questions.

28:32.711 --> 28:36.385
Mr. Gibbins, you said
you were lost that night.

28:36.385 --> 28:38.427
Is it possible this is because
you were disoriented?

28:38.427 --> 28:39.638
No.

28:39.638 --> 28:40.719
But isn't it true
you were placed

28:40.719 --> 28:42.802
on a psychiatric hold
due to exhaustion

28:42.802 --> 28:45.144
just months before winding up
at the scene of this crime?

28:45.144 --> 28:46.305
Objection.

28:46.305 --> 28:49.228
The witness passed
psychological evaluation.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.649
Challenging recollection,
Your Honor.

28:50.649 --> 28:51.771
I'll allow it.

28:51.771 --> 28:53.232
Don't you think
your mental-health issues

28:53.232 --> 28:55.614
might've confused you
as to what you saw that night?

28:55.614 --> 28:57.656
No, I know what I saw.

28:57.656 --> 28:59.318
It was him.

28:59.318 --> 29:01.620
What's driving you
to tell this lie, Mr. Gibbins?

29:01.620 --> 29:02.491
Objection.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.363
Compound
and argumentative.

29:04.363 --> 29:06.455
My client has an alibi.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.708
There are no phone records
or surveillance footage

29:09.708 --> 29:10.830
placing him at the scene.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.251
Only you -- a law student

29:12.251 --> 29:14.673
who happened to get lost
at just the right time.

29:14.673 --> 29:16.505
Counsel's testifying,
Your Honor.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.636
Sustained.

29:17.636 --> 29:18.928
Are you working
with someone

29:18.928 --> 29:21.430
who wants
to take my client down?
Ms. Benton.

29:21.430 --> 29:23.552
Or perhaps you're part of a plan
to shoot and murder

29:23.552 --> 29:25.764
my client's father
in cold blood.
Ms. Benton!

29:25.764 --> 29:27.016
Keep going like this,
and I will...

29:27.016 --> 29:29.228
send this case
to trial right now

29:29.228 --> 29:30.940
and censure you
so you are unable

29:30.940 --> 29:34.063
to represent your client...

29:34.063 --> 29:36.565
He did great.
You'd be proud.

29:36.565 --> 29:38.607
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

29:38.607 --> 29:43.202
No, he'd call you himself,
but Vince won't leave his side.

29:43.202 --> 29:45.784
It's fine -- just call me
when you know something.

29:49.618 --> 29:50.960
Laurel?

29:50.960 --> 29:52.751
Recess is over.
I'll call you after.

29:57.376 --> 29:59.798
So...?

29:59.798 --> 30:01.841
Nina was right.
It's a loser case.

30:01.841 --> 30:02.882
Please, don't hold back.

30:02.882 --> 30:04.303
But there's a way
to fix it.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.805
You appeal the
child-endangerment plea.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.098
My alcohol level
was off the charts.

30:09.098 --> 30:10.599
I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

30:10.599 --> 30:12.852
Easy is different
than impossible.
You know what?

30:12.852 --> 30:14.643
I'm guessing
you didn't get to this office

30:14.643 --> 30:16.315
by quitting every time
a man told you, "No."

30:16.315 --> 30:17.816
This is about my kids.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.989
If giving him my money
lets me have them back --

30:19.989 --> 30:21.740
With two visits a month,

30:21.740 --> 30:23.652
supervised by a social worker
who sees you as the enemy?

30:23.652 --> 30:25.404
You fight this,

30:25.404 --> 30:27.706
especially if your children mean
as much as you say they do.

30:27.706 --> 30:28.617
Of course they do.

30:28.617 --> 30:29.748
Then why ain't you
fighting?

30:29.748 --> 30:30.749
I am.
No, you're not.

30:30.749 --> 30:31.750
You're calling me
to your office

30:31.750 --> 30:33.372
to cry for help.

30:33.372 --> 30:34.623
That's not a mother
anyone would want.

30:34.623 --> 30:37.046
They want a beast.
You have that.

30:37.046 --> 30:38.587
You're just letting
this one man

30:38.587 --> 30:39.879
beat it out of you.

30:45.264 --> 30:46.675
Is that what your husband
did to you?

30:49.598 --> 30:51.020
A lot of men.

30:55.935 --> 30:57.897
I'll take this case
if you want.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.278
No, that's --
You don't --

30:59.278 --> 31:01.150
What?

31:01.150 --> 31:03.112
You think
you can do better?

31:06.695 --> 31:08.787
How did you meet
Charles Mahoney?

31:08.787 --> 31:11.330
At an investment-banking
conference earlier this year.

31:11.330 --> 31:13.662
That's when you two
started sleeping together?

31:13.662 --> 31:17.706
Yes, we would meet once
or twice a week at my home.

31:17.706 --> 31:19.838
What time did Charles
come to your house

31:19.838 --> 31:21.760
on the day
that his father was murdered?

31:21.760 --> 31:22.761
Around 9:00.

31:22.761 --> 31:23.552
Did your daughter see him?

31:23.552 --> 31:24.673
No.

31:24.673 --> 31:25.884
Because he wasn't there?

31:25.884 --> 31:28.057
Because I don't
introduce my daughter

31:28.057 --> 31:29.969
to men
I'm not serious with.

31:29.969 --> 31:32.471
When's the last time
you spoke with Charles?

31:32.471 --> 31:34.103
Before he was arrested.

31:34.103 --> 31:35.474
Has there been
any contact since?

31:35.474 --> 31:36.355
No.

31:36.355 --> 31:37.566
Nothing at all?

31:37.566 --> 31:38.727
As I said, no.

31:38.727 --> 31:40.689
Then explain the call
you made yesterday

31:40.689 --> 31:43.652
from your home
to Charles in prison.

31:46.485 --> 31:47.406
Munchies?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.578
Here's an actual fix.

31:49.578 --> 31:51.410
I'm not getting involved
with whatever this is.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.372
Even if it's for Wes?

31:53.372 --> 31:55.334
Please.

31:55.334 --> 31:56.835
He's in trouble.

32:00.749 --> 32:01.961
This is Nate Lahey --
I'm an investigator

32:01.961 --> 32:03.592
in the Philly D.A.'s office.

32:03.592 --> 32:04.923
Be quick -- I'm about
to head into court.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.346
We got a suspect here who says
your guy up at Rikers,

32:07.346 --> 32:09.098
Charles Mahoney,
has a burner in his cell.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.551
Hello?

32:12.551 --> 32:14.433
Hello?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.055
Who is this?

32:17.436 --> 32:19.018
That is your home phone number,
isn't it?

32:19.018 --> 32:19.898
Yes.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.690
Assumes facts
not in evidence.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.152
Here's the burner phone

32:23.152 --> 32:25.234
recovered
from Mr. Mahoney's cell,

32:25.234 --> 32:27.526
along with records
corroborating

32:27.526 --> 32:31.160
the incoming call came
from the defendant's home.

32:31.160 --> 32:34.994
Ms. Cameron,
did the Mahoneys pay you

32:34.994 --> 32:36.125
to lie on the stand
today?

32:36.125 --> 32:37.876
Objection!
Badgering the witness!

32:37.876 --> 32:38.917
Overruled.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.579
Answer the question.

32:40.579 --> 32:41.500
No.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.711
Really?

32:42.711 --> 32:44.713
Oh, so your daughter
made the call to Charles,

32:44.713 --> 32:46.175
or more likely,

32:46.175 --> 32:47.586
you snuck a burner
into his cell

32:47.586 --> 32:49.888
so that you could
get your story straight today.

32:49.888 --> 32:52.141
Judge, the defense requests
a chain of custody hearing

32:52.141 --> 32:53.592
to determine the veracity
of these claims.

32:53.592 --> 32:55.094
Why?

32:55.094 --> 32:57.306
We have an eyewitness
that places your client

32:57.306 --> 32:58.727
at the scene of the crime,

32:58.727 --> 33:01.100
his fingerprints
on the murder weapon,

33:01.100 --> 33:03.062
not to mention
a financial motive

33:03.062 --> 33:05.774
that exceeds $25 billion.

33:05.774 --> 33:06.945
Please, Your Honor.

33:06.945 --> 33:09.278
Let's not waste
any more taxpayer money.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.659
Just months ago,

33:10.659 --> 33:14.113
a maniac with a gun
took away the love of my life.

33:14.113 --> 33:19.458
I have never felt such grief
until today, when I realized

33:19.458 --> 33:22.961
I might lose my only son,
Charles, as well.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.175
As a mother, I feel helpless

33:26.175 --> 33:30.589
watching my son be persecuted
for a crime he did not commit.

33:30.589 --> 33:33.682
As a citizen, I feel anger

33:33.682 --> 33:37.186
towards the system
that allows innocent people...

33:37.186 --> 33:38.637
What you reading?

33:38.637 --> 33:39.848
...to be
wrongfully imprisoned.

33:39.848 --> 33:41.480
Just the news.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.103
Let's eat.

33:44.103 --> 33:44.773
What?

33:44.773 --> 33:46.235
If I hacked your laptop,

33:46.235 --> 33:47.196
would I find out
that you're actually reading

33:47.196 --> 33:48.357
about Wes' court case?

33:50.359 --> 33:51.530
Did you not hear me
when I said

33:51.530 --> 33:52.651
that I wanted to stay
in the bubble?

33:52.651 --> 33:55.033
Yeah, I did.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.617
Uh, I just
don't believe you.

33:58.617 --> 34:01.210
Come on, like you all aren't
hiding a ton of crap from me.

34:01.210 --> 34:02.461
I've always been honest
with you

34:02.461 --> 34:04.042
about how there are
certain things I can't tell you

34:04.042 --> 34:04.923
for your own protection.

34:04.923 --> 34:06.755
Oh, boy,
that line again.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.967
You're kidding me.

34:08.967 --> 34:10.839
All I've ever done

34:10.839 --> 34:13.592
is tell you
to stay away from Annalise,

34:13.592 --> 34:16.935
but, instead, your dumb ass
begged her for a job.

34:16.935 --> 34:18.016
Here we go.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.017
Been -- what? --
like three nice days,

34:19.017 --> 34:20.309
and I'm already remembering

34:20.309 --> 34:21.850
why we broke up
in the first place.

34:21.850 --> 34:23.142
You said
that you broke up with me

34:23.142 --> 34:24.733
because you needed
time to yourself.

34:24.733 --> 34:26.645
Was that a lie?
No.

34:26.645 --> 34:28.447
Then how does this have anything
to do with why you dumped me?

34:28.447 --> 34:30.028
Because you've never been
totally honest with me.

34:30.028 --> 34:31.150
'Cause this
is bigger than me.

34:31.150 --> 34:32.691
Look...

34:32.691 --> 34:34.493
If you're so curious,
why don't you go ask Annalise?

34:34.493 --> 34:35.574
Oh, so this is
Annalise's fault now?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.366
Yes!
No! No!

34:37.366 --> 34:39.498
You are the one choosing
to not tell me about the stuff

34:39.498 --> 34:41.410
going on about Wes!
Because it's not
my place.

34:41.410 --> 34:43.122
Maybe it's because
you're afraid

34:43.122 --> 34:44.873
that I'll really know
who you are

34:44.873 --> 34:45.794
and not like him.

34:45.794 --> 34:47.336
You do know me.

34:47.336 --> 34:49.128
Parts of you,
but guess what, Connor --

34:49.128 --> 34:51.089
I want to know everything
about the guy that I'm with --

34:51.089 --> 34:53.712
the good and the bad --
that's what love is.

34:53.712 --> 34:56.014
No, I think love is letting
a guy stomp on your heart

34:56.014 --> 34:58.557
and still being there for him
when another guy rejects him!

34:58.557 --> 35:01.810
Oh, you think that
letting me cry on your shoulder

35:01.810 --> 35:03.562
is proof
that you love me?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.434
Yes! Because I do.

35:05.434 --> 35:06.685
No.

35:08.026 --> 35:10.899
I think you only love
the idea of me.

35:10.899 --> 35:12.861
No, I love you.
Like I'm
some security blanket

35:12.861 --> 35:14.443
that you wrap
around yourself

35:14.443 --> 35:16.405
every time things get
too intense with Annalise.
That's not true.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.657
And that --
that's not real love.

35:18.657 --> 35:22.701
That is just some severe,
messed-up emotional damage

35:22.701 --> 35:23.912
that you've been
carrying around with you

35:23.912 --> 35:25.083
since the day I met you.

35:26.295 --> 35:28.797
Is that what you
think of me?

35:28.797 --> 35:29.958
That I'm damaged?

35:36.255 --> 35:37.846
I kept telling myself

35:37.846 --> 35:40.098
that I was the jerk
this whole time.

35:41.350 --> 35:42.931
Connor.

35:42.931 --> 35:43.682
Connor!

35:47.356 --> 35:49.688
Think Frank
might stop by?

35:49.688 --> 35:50.979
Don't joke about that.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.614
You don't think
I could take him?

35:57.736 --> 35:59.538
You're worried.

35:59.538 --> 36:00.619
Of course.

36:00.619 --> 36:01.780
Don't be.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.412
Today was a good day.

36:03.412 --> 36:05.123
And tomorrow?

36:05.123 --> 36:07.336
Let's not think
about that.

36:08.337 --> 36:09.958
Come here.

36:13.502 --> 36:16.425
I've got you.

36:16.425 --> 36:18.217
What?

36:20.058 --> 36:23.222
You're always
looking out for me.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.643
Now it's my turn.

36:26.395 --> 36:29.017
I got you.

36:29.017 --> 36:32.311
Well, I've got myself.
Thank you very much.

36:32.311 --> 36:33.862
I know...

36:33.862 --> 36:35.614
but I'm gonna
be there, too.

36:41.820 --> 36:43.372
He in there?

36:45.374 --> 36:46.665
Go home.

36:46.665 --> 36:47.706
No.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.957
You had your time with him,

36:48.957 --> 36:50.459
lied to my face about it.

36:50.459 --> 36:52.090
This is my time.

36:52.090 --> 36:53.462
Leave!

37:19.358 --> 37:22.911
Thank you for seeing me.

37:29.037 --> 37:31.039
Really?

37:31.039 --> 37:32.461
If you're gonna
screw Oliver,

37:32.461 --> 37:34.833
at least stay the night
and give my couch a rest.

37:39.468 --> 37:41.680
What's wrong?

37:41.680 --> 37:43.382
I hate him.

37:43.382 --> 37:45.053
I hate him so much!

37:45.053 --> 37:46.305
Connor!

37:50.349 --> 37:52.060
What the hell
happened in here?

38:13.502 --> 38:14.713
Hello?

38:16.375 --> 38:18.417
I begged Sam
to let me tell you.

38:18.417 --> 38:22.471
Every day after we got back,
you were just...

38:22.471 --> 38:24.052
locked up in that bedroom.

38:24.052 --> 38:27.055
But...he wouldn't even
let me in the house.

38:29.137 --> 38:32.691
He knew me so well,

38:32.691 --> 38:34.643
knew how to make me
do what he wanted.

38:36.395 --> 38:41.069
And the more time went on,
I thought maybe he was right.

38:41.069 --> 38:43.362
You went back to work,

38:43.362 --> 38:44.823
got better.

38:47.496 --> 38:49.578
I never got better.

38:53.211 --> 38:55.834
You watched me suffer
all those years.

39:00.379 --> 39:03.592
You watched me think
that I killed my boy.

39:05.464 --> 39:09.928
You watched Sam and I
fall apart.

39:09.928 --> 39:12.431
And you said nothing.

39:12.431 --> 39:13.311
Sam wouldn't let me.

39:13.311 --> 39:15.183
Oh.

39:15.183 --> 39:19.357
You had all those months
to apologize,

39:19.357 --> 39:21.740
and all you can do
is blame Sam.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.289
You killed my son.

39:38.256 --> 39:40.629
That was you.

39:42.501 --> 39:48.637
And you had the nerve --
the nerve to stay in my life.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.809
Make me trust you,
take care of you.

39:50.809 --> 39:52.431
I just want to fix this.

39:52.431 --> 39:53.602
How can you do that?

39:53.602 --> 39:55.143
Hmm?

39:55.143 --> 39:56.775
How do you do that, Frank?

39:56.775 --> 39:58.437
You gonna erase it all?

39:58.437 --> 40:00.979
Take everything away?
Give me my baby back?

40:00.979 --> 40:02.691
I can try.

40:02.691 --> 40:03.522
You can't.

40:03.522 --> 40:04.613
I can.

40:11.239 --> 40:13.622
Let me fix it.

40:24.042 --> 40:26.805
What's taking you
so long, huh?

40:26.805 --> 40:28.717
Think I'm gonna feel guilty?
Because I won't.

40:31.049 --> 40:34.182
I love you, Annalise.

40:34.182 --> 40:35.313
Frank?

40:35.313 --> 40:36.685
Don't.

40:36.685 --> 40:37.726
Get out.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.357
This just
hurts her more.

40:39.357 --> 40:40.438
You'll do this for me.

40:40.438 --> 40:41.520
This isn't what
she wants.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.611
This is exactly
what I want.

40:42.611 --> 40:44.653
You made your point!

40:44.653 --> 40:46.234
Pull that trigger!
She can't survive this.

40:46.234 --> 40:48.366
Pull it! Do it!
I can't survive this.

40:48.366 --> 40:50.328
Pull the trigger!
Please don't, Frank!

40:50.328 --> 40:52.070
Do it! Pull it!
Please don't do it!

40:52.070 --> 40:54.072
Do it! Do it for me!
Don't, please! Don't!

40:54.072 --> 40:55.333
Don't do it!
Pull it! Do it!

40:55.333 --> 40:56.875
Do it! Do it!
Don't!

40:56.875 --> 40:57.996
Do it!
Don't!

40:57.996 --> 40:59.247
Do it! Do it!
Don't!

40:59.247 --> 41:00.879
Do it! Do it!

41:00.879 --> 41:01.670
No!

41:22.561 --> 41:23.902
Bonnie. Bonnie, thank God.
Why haven't you been answering
your phone?

41:23.902 --> 41:25.694
What the hell happened?

41:25.694 --> 41:26.985
Someone went
to the police.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.486
-What are you talking about?
-What?

41:28.486 --> 41:30.779
Annalise was arrested
because of an anonymous source.

41:30.779 --> 41:32.030
Annalise called everyone
over to the house.

41:32.030 --> 41:33.451
Did you know about that?

41:33.451 --> 41:34.663
She didn't do this.

41:34.663 --> 41:36.034
Then why
did she lie to my face?

41:36.034 --> 41:38.286
She said she didn't know
if somebody died in the fire,

41:38.286 --> 41:39.958
but she did, didn't she?

41:39.958 --> 41:41.329
What are you talking about?

41:41.329 --> 41:43.211
It's all over the news. There's
an unidentified male body.

41:43.211 --> 41:45.043
Oh, my God,
you know who it is.

41:45.043 --> 41:46.795
You're not telling me
because it's Connor, right?

41:46.795 --> 41:48.126
I swear to God,
if you lie to us right now,

41:48.126 --> 41:49.337
I'll go to the police.

41:49.337 --> 41:50.759
Just tell us
who it is!
Is Connor dead?

41:50.759 --> 41:51.890
- Please just tell us.
- Just tell me, please.

41:56.474 --> 41:57.515
Oops. Sorry about that.

42:04.272 --> 42:05.944
It happens.

42:07.696 --> 42:09.197
Can it, uh...

42:09.197 --> 42:11.149
happen again?
