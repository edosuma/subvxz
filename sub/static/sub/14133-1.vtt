04:17.034 --> 04:18.831
Labor Day weekend.

04:19.274 --> 04:22.027
Some time for a garbage strike.

04:22.474 --> 04:25.034
Everybody crazy to stock up.

04:25.474 --> 04:30.628
They want to score at the last minute
and they want it now. Never fails.

04:31.074 --> 04:34.066
The faces look alike.
You gotta use memory tricks:

04:34.514 --> 04:37.984
each has some peculiarity.
It keeps you sharp.

04:38.874 --> 04:43.709
A D. D. told me, when a drug dealer
starts writing a diary he should quit.

04:44.154 --> 04:48.830
I started writing after that.
Not every night. Now and then.

04:49.274 --> 04:53.825
Fill up one book,
throw it out, start another.

05:29.074 --> 05:31.110
Darling!
- Ann...

05:32.274 --> 05:34.469
Have we made New York
safe for another weekend?

05:34.914 --> 05:38.702
Get a job. - Sad what 10 years

05:39.154 --> 05:43.227
Got any hundreds?
- Twenties.

05:46.034 --> 05:49.344
And some tens.
- Tens? - Goddamn cash machines!

05:49.794 --> 05:53.469
Did what's-his-name give you
a hard time? - No. "CBD".

05:53.914 --> 05:57.463
Fucking investment bankers!
"Cash Before Delivery. "

05:57.914 --> 06:02.908
To these Wall Street kids cash
is like some theoretical concept.

06:03.354 --> 06:05.504
I mean, we see'em at 2, right?
9 o'clock, I shudder to think,

06:05.954 --> 06:09.947
they're buying and selling! It has
turned me off the stock market!

06:10.394 --> 06:11.827
Tell me about it.

06:12.274 --> 06:16.392
I've thought of investing many times
but it's just too damn crooked.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.394
These people...
- It's late.

06:19.834 --> 06:23.270
I gotta crash.
Or try, anyway. You stayin'?

06:23.834 --> 06:27.793
It's over.
- It's okay? - Yeah, sure.

06:28.234 --> 06:30.987
You look like you're coming down
with something. Take some C's. Go on.

06:31.434 --> 06:34.232
I'll take care of anything
that comes in. - Thanks.

06:36.954 --> 06:39.991
Sleep tight.
- Pick up the trash!

06:42.674 --> 06:45.632
See you tomorrow.
- Big kiss.

07:00.434 --> 07:03.506
"Labor Day".
"Union Movement".

07:03.954 --> 07:08.106
There's a contradiction in terms.
I know about long hours.

07:08.554 --> 07:12.069
It's worse when I'm off.
I just walk and walk.

07:12.514 --> 07:16.473
There's an element of providence
to it all. Like rolling numbers.

07:16.914 --> 07:17.869
Luck.

07:18.314 --> 07:23.263
Some guy that looks a little like you
does a stick-up 4 hours ago.

07:23.714 --> 07:26.831
A cop pulls you in because
he's cold and wants to go inside.

07:27.274 --> 07:29.424
They grab your stash.
Your number's up.

07:29.874 --> 07:33.423
You're busted for nothing.
For bad luck.

07:42.074 --> 07:46.590
I like your jacket. - Thanks, man.
I got it in a trade. Is that it?

07:47.234 --> 07:50.783
Are they "faced"?
- Don't bore me.

07:51.474 --> 07:56.673
Is it so much work to face them? If
you don't do it, I got to. It's time.

07:57.114 --> 08:01.187
You're too much. - We've been through
this. This 19-gram shit is a drag.

08:01.634 --> 08:05.786
We pay you more, you put up with more.
White drugs for white people.

08:06.874 --> 08:08.751
Twice the price, twice the safety.

08:10.874 --> 08:14.583
I can't believe Ann's never been
busted. She's something.

08:15.034 --> 08:17.946
Never made any big money either.
She blows it.

08:18.394 --> 08:22.546
You believe that? What'll you do after
she quits? How long you been with her?

08:22.994 --> 08:26.509
She's always saying that.
We'll see, Jealous.

08:26.954 --> 08:31.391
She's out. You pick up her trade, man.
You're too old to be a go-fer.

08:31.994 --> 08:35.543
No way.
I'm not the management type.

08:39.794 --> 08:42.831
If I take charge,
I'll start using again.

08:43.274 --> 08:49.304
It's not for me.
I know some music people.

08:49.754 --> 08:52.826
I'm gonna get into recording.

09:11.594 --> 09:12.424
Tour?

09:13.357 --> 09:14.057
Yeah?

09:19.954 --> 09:22.343
This wouldn't matter to you,
but you may get hassled.

09:22.794 --> 09:26.548
Why? - Don't you read the papers, man?
The Park murder is all over the Post!

09:26.994 --> 09:31.909
Mariah Rangel, 19-year-old Barnard
co-ed bitch, dead in Turtle Pond.

09:32.674 --> 09:35.950
Coked to the fucking gills. Suddenly
they're hot after mid-level dealers.

09:36.394 --> 09:37.952
You know her?

09:38.394 --> 09:39.747
Who knows?

09:42.034 --> 09:44.025
Thanks for the warning.

09:57.114 --> 10:01.426
You pick up from Jealous? - Yeah,
I had to make 4 trips last night.

10:01.874 --> 10:05.423
We're certainly not his favorite people.
- Well, we don't make the laws.

10:05.874 --> 10:09.264
19 is carrying, 20 is dealing.
Let him be stupid!

10:09.714 --> 10:11.989
He took my hundreds.

10:12.434 --> 10:16.473
Take over for me a while.
I'm getting contact high. - P. P.?

10:16.914 --> 10:17.869
Yeah. 7-3.

10:23.554 --> 10:27.991
So who's Her Majesty talking to?
- The ecstasy connection from Arizona.

10:28.434 --> 10:31.983
She's trying to get them
to come up here. Or better, Europe.

10:32.434 --> 10:37.792
That's where the money is. - Yeah, all
mark-up. Could be the big one, Jack.

10:38.234 --> 10:39.986
Don't dress.

10:44.914 --> 10:48.623
You really think she means it
this time? - That's what she says.

10:49.074 --> 10:53.113
New Year's Eve. She had her chart
done. New Year's Eve and out.

10:53.554 --> 10:55.829
No Acid House,
no product, no delivery.

10:56.274 --> 11:00.665
That's just her mouth talking.
- Next year: strictly "Akasha".

11:01.114 --> 11:04.072
Cosmetics. That's what she's calling
the company now. - I don't get it.

11:04.514 --> 11:08.029
Why would anyone want to pay
to put weeds on their face?

11:08.474 --> 11:11.910
Why'd anyone pay
to put 'em up their nose?

11:12.354 --> 11:15.824
Robert, you got a point there.

11:18.514 --> 11:20.744
I like cosmetics.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.944
I need cosmetics.

11:25.394 --> 11:26.907
You should come in with us.

11:28.034 --> 11:31.913
You forget she hasn't asked me.

11:32.834 --> 11:35.507
Johnny! Robert!
Get your butts in here!

11:36.314 --> 11:38.191
Coming!

11:39.954 --> 11:43.344
Plant 2 big kisses on me, boys.
1, 500 Ex, 30 each

11:43.794 --> 11:46.262
and the delivery is here!

11:47.114 --> 11:50.106
Thanks. How do you like it? - Great!
- No, I mean the face cream.

11:50.554 --> 11:54.627
Marigold, chamomile, almond, aloe, egg.
I remixed it. - Nice. - You like it?

11:55.074 --> 11:59.989
Thanks. Which reminds me, get me some
almond oil but not the California.

12:00.434 --> 12:03.904
What do we have to eat? - We haven't
had Thai in a while. - Indian!

12:04.354 --> 12:06.026
Sweetheart, it's Saturday.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.227
Thai...

12:09.954 --> 12:12.832
I'm gonna start with "Mee Krob".

12:13.274 --> 12:17.267
Ann, this is Ed... - Answer that,
he'll call back every 5 minutes.

12:17.714 --> 12:20.103
The night begins.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.429
Curry,

12:22.874 --> 12:27.311
"Po Tak", the bouillabaisse is
awfully good. Or "Ped Srilom":

12:27.754 --> 12:32.430
duck in plum and ginger sauce.
- I'm gonna go veggie. "Puk Ob".

12:32.874 --> 12:36.264
That's not gonna be enough for you.
- Do you want "Puk Ob"?

12:36.714 --> 12:40.832
You use it for facial cream.
- Remove unsightly hair!

12:41.274 --> 12:45.506
You laugh! You're gonna be watching me
on "Oprah" from a welfare hotel.

12:45.954 --> 12:47.592
Forgive us.
- All right.

12:48.034 --> 12:51.344
Eddie wants "now".
- Now!

12:51.794 --> 12:55.070
His place. Top Lady. God knows
what happened to his shit yesterday.

12:55.514 --> 12:59.143
You take it. Check in. - I thought
we were supposed to be light tonight.

12:59.594 --> 13:03.712
Don't you watch TV?
- I don't have one. - You don't?

13:04.154 --> 13:05.712
Well, if you had a TV,

13:06.154 --> 13:10.227
you'd know it's supposed to rain.
- It's good for the trees.

13:10.674 --> 13:14.667
Some farmer whacked his numerology
on us. - Yep, it's starting!

13:15.114 --> 13:16.263
Raining?

13:16.714 --> 13:21.834
The Famers' Almanac is based
on numerology. - Take your jacket.

13:22.274 --> 13:25.152
You better clean up the parlor
in time for dinner...

13:33.794 --> 13:38.265
Le Tour! Finally! What took you
so long? - Traffic. It's raining.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.272
How's things?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.665
I need a quarter. You got it?

13:45.114 --> 13:47.105
Robert sold you a quarter yesterday.

13:47.554 --> 13:52.105
That was an eighth. Some friends
came over. How much is that?

13:52.554 --> 13:55.512
1,400, right? Hey, you wanna buy this?

13:55.954 --> 13:58.548
Eddie, sit down. Sit down!

14:01.194 --> 14:05.346
I've known you how long?
8 years? Knew you from the other job.

14:05.794 --> 14:08.149
The one before
the last one you fucked up.

14:08.594 --> 14:10.824
I knew your wife. She was great.

14:11.274 --> 14:14.311
We used to sit around and talk...
- You didn't know what she was like.

14:15.274 --> 14:20.746
This is no good. You gotta cool it.
Go to bed, sleep it off.

14:23.314 --> 14:27.944
I'll sell you a gram and some downs
but I won't put you in hospital.

14:28.874 --> 14:32.833
You charge 200 bucks
for what goes for 90 on the street

14:33.434 --> 14:36.506
and you're not gonna sell?
- So go out on the street!

14:36.954 --> 14:40.424
I'll call Ann. - Go ahead. The phone's
over there. You know what she'll say.

14:40.874 --> 14:43.263
I'll tell the fucking cops!

14:44.474 --> 14:48.467
Fuck you. That's it. You're out.
- I'm sorry, Tour, I was kidding.

14:48.914 --> 14:53.146
You were right. I'm quitting anyway.
I'll take the gram. I'm sorry.

14:54.234 --> 14:56.304
You gonna cool it?

14:57.674 --> 15:00.188
Go to bed, sleep it off?

15:01.074 --> 15:02.712
You got downers?

15:03.754 --> 15:05.824
200, right?

15:16.274 --> 15:17.992
Where was I? All right,

15:18.434 --> 15:22.313
so if there's no God,
then how can we conceive of him?

15:22.754 --> 15:27.589
I mean, the idea of God
presupposes the existence of God.

15:28.034 --> 15:32.789
That is the Ontological Argument.
That's Anselm. That's 1200 or 1400.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.589
Don't leave, Tour, stay.
Listen, this is the good part.

15:36.034 --> 15:41.552
If the idea of God
is implanted by God,

15:42.034 --> 15:45.390
the "Sensus Divinitatus",
the sense of the divine, you know?

15:45.834 --> 15:50.589
Then what is
the role of human thought?

15:51.034 --> 15:52.911
Not faith. Thought.

15:53.354 --> 15:56.869
Everybody wants to talk.
It's like a compulsion.

15:57.314 --> 16:01.307
My philosophy is:
You got nothing to say? Don't say it.

16:01.754 --> 16:04.268
They figure,
you can tell a D. D. anything.

16:04.714 --> 16:09.265
Things they'd never tell anyone else.
Of course they're stoned to start.

16:09.714 --> 16:11.386
Do you think that all of our thoughts

16:11.834 --> 16:16.624
are on a prerecorded tape
and planted in our brain at birth?

16:17.074 --> 16:18.268
I do.

16:43.714 --> 16:46.069
Carlos,
pull over to the far left corner.

16:46.514 --> 16:49.631
You see the woman with
the umbrella, with the trench coat?

16:50.074 --> 16:51.029
You got it.

17:04.834 --> 17:08.065
Marianne! Hop in.
I'll give you a ride.

17:09.434 --> 17:11.345
John?
- Get in.

17:13.993 --> 17:16.428
You're getting soaked.

17:25.874 --> 17:29.947
Where are you going? You know,
I didn't know you still lived here.

17:30.394 --> 17:34.865
Maybe this is... I should get out.
- No, don't be crazy! It's pouring!

17:35.834 --> 17:39.952
I'm not supposed to be around...
- Former drug associates?

17:40.394 --> 17:43.067
It's 4 years I'm clean.
There's no drugs, no alcohol, nothing.

17:43.514 --> 17:46.551
I heard. I'm happy for you.

17:46.994 --> 17:49.667
It's still not easy.
- I know.

17:50.114 --> 17:55.746
You don't have to avoid me.
I'm straight. Yeah, 2 years now.

17:56.834 --> 18:00.986
It just came that time. I tried
to tell you. I wrote. I called.

18:01.434 --> 18:03.152
I should get out.
- Honest.

18:03.594 --> 18:06.791
You're dealing.
- No, I stopped.

18:07.234 --> 18:10.112
What's in the bag?
- Almond oil.

18:11.114 --> 18:12.911
Go ahead, check!

18:17.994 --> 18:21.543
Shit! - What's that for? In case
anyone needs almond oil late at night?

18:21.994 --> 18:24.428
Okay, I deal a little.
But I'm straight. That part is true.

18:24.874 --> 18:28.753
Stop the car. Right now. Stop it.
- I won't say any more. I promise.

18:29.194 --> 18:31.150
I'll just sit here, give you a ride.

18:32.914 --> 18:34.108
Right over here.

18:43.034 --> 18:44.069
Bye, John.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.387
83rd Street.

19:48.874 --> 19:52.230
How did you hear about me?
- I don't know.

19:52.674 --> 19:54.312
I just decided to come.

19:56.354 --> 19:59.903
I look at you
and I give you my impressions.

20:01.274 --> 20:04.789
I feel your vibrations.
I hate that word.

20:05.234 --> 20:09.113
It sounds so phony, doesn't it?
But I can't think of anything better.

20:11.274 --> 20:13.071
You're anxious.

20:14.194 --> 20:16.185
More than usual.

20:18.194 --> 20:20.025
Your livelihood is endangered.

20:20.474 --> 20:22.908
You're worried about the future.

20:23.354 --> 20:25.663
You don't have much money saved.

20:31.514 --> 20:34.631
I see a woman who has betrayed you.

20:36.314 --> 20:37.667
My mother?

20:38.354 --> 20:40.151
Will betray you.

20:41.754 --> 20:45.463
No, I don't think so.
- Keep it in mind.

20:45.914 --> 20:48.633
I have a strong feeling about
this woman, a woman close to you.

20:49.074 --> 20:50.826
She will betray you.

20:55.874 --> 20:58.911
You're in the entertainment business,
aren't you? - Yeah.

21:00.114 --> 21:03.629
But you're not happy there.
You want to do something else.

21:06.154 --> 21:07.633
It's music, isn't it?

21:10.474 --> 21:12.669
You're still drinking, aren't you?

21:14.074 --> 21:19.068
You have a drinking problem?
- No, I don't think so.

21:19.914 --> 21:24.385
I feel it's interfering with
your health and with your life too.

21:25.234 --> 21:29.432
You've had other problems.
Drug addiction.

21:30.554 --> 21:32.272
This was very important in your life.

21:32.714 --> 21:35.751
Teresa, I'm 38 years old.

21:38.194 --> 21:40.503
40.
- You're still young.

21:41.794 --> 21:44.103
I have trouble sleeping.

21:45.594 --> 21:49.792
Look. What are you seeing?
What is around me?

21:50.954 --> 21:54.913
Is it dark?
Have I run out of luck?

21:56.834 --> 21:59.394
Is there luck for me?

21:59.834 --> 22:03.224
Everything you need is around you.

22:04.474 --> 22:07.034
The only danger is inside you.

22:13.354 --> 22:15.584
Love this machine.
- Amazing.

22:17.514 --> 22:20.153
Excuse me.
- Sweetheart, your pay's on the table.

22:34.034 --> 22:37.185
I'm happy to change
large bills for small, for 1 percent.

22:37.634 --> 22:39.511
Is this the latest model?

22:39.954 --> 22:44.709
I think another one just came out.
- You look like a doctor.

22:47.314 --> 22:51.023
Same time?
- In 2 weeks. But don't go. Stay.

22:51.474 --> 22:55.069
We'll order kosher.
I'll tell you dirty stories.

22:55.514 --> 22:57.345
We'll talk Zionism.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.069
I gotta go. I'm late already.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.069
I only come here because I like you.
- Oh, please.

23:03.514 --> 23:06.551
Are you sure you're not Jewish?
- What do you mean? My nails?

23:06.994 --> 23:08.825
I don't want to see you get hurt.
- I'm fine.

23:09.274 --> 23:11.344
You should do something else.
- Like what?

23:11.794 --> 23:16.026
Like find a man. - God, you're so
Jewish! Of course you're Jewish!

23:16.474 --> 23:19.432
Wait a minute, I have an idea,
how about investing in my cosmetics?

23:19.874 --> 23:22.468
It's a great investment.
- Never mix business with friendship.

23:22.914 --> 23:26.748
Just let me show you the prospectus.
- I gotta go, I'm sorry.

23:27.194 --> 23:28.707
God bless you.

23:29.674 --> 23:33.747
Don't eat any hotdogs!
See you in 2 weeks. - Goodbye.

23:39.594 --> 23:42.904
Hello, this is Ann.
Please leave a message.

23:45.794 --> 23:46.749
This is Karen...

23:47.194 --> 23:51.346
Jealous mentioned a yuppie murder in
the Park. Heard about it? - Sure.

23:51.794 --> 23:55.343
It's on the 5 o'clock news.
- He said to be careful. - We are.

23:55.794 --> 24:00.743
We're too small time. Anyway,
she's not one of ours. Not directly.

24:01.794 --> 24:04.991
Tis is at St. Luke's.
- What? What happened? - No big deal.

24:05.434 --> 24:08.471
He's in the waiting room and he wants
one of us over there right away.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.792
But can't it wait till he gets home?

24:12.234 --> 24:16.022
Take it, will you? We have to stay
on his good side to set up Arizona.

24:16.474 --> 24:20.023
Second floor waiting room.
You want to leave first?

24:30.274 --> 24:31.753
You wanna have lunch
with me tomorrow?

24:32.794 --> 24:33.909
Me?

24:34.954 --> 24:37.627
One o'clock. "Côte Basque".
Too early for you?

24:38.954 --> 24:42.026
No, I'll be there.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.309
Doctor Shell,
please come to the emergency room.

24:59.754 --> 25:02.268
Doctor Shell,
please come to the emergency room.

25:04.154 --> 25:08.113
I couldn't find the place. - Thanks
for coming. - I came right away.

25:10.314 --> 25:13.545
What's going on? - Got some valiums?
- Yeah, and 'ludes.

25:13.994 --> 25:16.269
Just a valium. A ten.

25:17.634 --> 25:20.910
What is it? - You won't believe it.
What a nightmare!

25:21.354 --> 25:25.711
I brought in this chick.
She O. D.'d. I didn't even know her.

25:26.154 --> 25:29.863
I didn't have to bring her in.
The cops're coming back to talk to me.

25:30.314 --> 25:34.671
I'm hyper. I gotta come down. This
would never happen in Zurich. - Here.

25:37.514 --> 25:38.742
Make it two.

25:43.754 --> 25:44.789
Thanks.

25:46.354 --> 25:48.914
Is she okay?
- Who? - The girl.

25:50.754 --> 25:53.791
Yeah. Met her last night.
A walking vacuum cleaner.

25:54.234 --> 25:58.352
What a nightmare. Underage.
- You need a lawyer?

25:59.034 --> 26:00.865
He's here.

26:02.834 --> 26:05.302
Thanks.
- Anytime.

26:24.994 --> 26:27.588
Randi?
- Oh, my God! John!

26:28.634 --> 26:32.513
Oh, my God. I can't believe it!
- It's good to see you.

26:32.954 --> 26:35.104
Marianne's here too. She flew in.

26:35.554 --> 26:38.466
What are you doing here?
Is there a problem?

26:38.914 --> 26:41.747
Mom. She's back in. You didn't know?

26:42.194 --> 26:44.913
Something serious?
- More chemo.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.551
Can I see her? - She's sleeping.
She sleeps most of the time.

26:48.994 --> 26:51.428
She'd like it though.
She still talks about you.

26:51.874 --> 26:53.148
I'm so sorry.

26:53.594 --> 26:57.303
Your Mom's a terrific woman.
I was always crazy about her.

27:00.274 --> 27:03.550
It's John. What a coincidence.

27:08.314 --> 27:12.227
Randi told me about your mother.
I'm so sorry. - Thanks.

27:12.674 --> 27:17.509
She's sedated? - You know, she'd be
happy to see John, don't you think?

27:17.954 --> 27:22.311
I'd like that.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

27:25.074 --> 27:27.030
You both look tired.

27:28.274 --> 27:31.710
One of us has to always be here.
- They let us stay in her room.

27:32.154 --> 27:36.386
Could I buy you a cup of coffee? We
could go downstairs to the cafeteria.

27:36.834 --> 27:40.952
You go. It's my turn with Mom.
- I shouldn't. - Yes, you should.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.713
Go!

27:47.634 --> 27:48.623
Black?

27:49.994 --> 27:52.224
Kiss your mother for me.

27:59.394 --> 28:03.512
You know it's gonna happen someday.
But when it does...

28:03.954 --> 28:06.548
Your mother, that was a shock.

28:10.554 --> 28:13.626
Has she been sick long?
- A year.

28:16.314 --> 28:17.269
What about your father?

28:18.754 --> 28:21.393
Not this time. His new wife.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.587
He'll make it to the funeral.

28:26.434 --> 28:29.426
What have you been doing?
Where do you live?

28:31.114 --> 28:32.593
It's been...

28:36.194 --> 28:39.903
I don't want you to know
about my life. - Anything?

28:42.274 --> 28:43.912
You married?

28:44.954 --> 28:48.629
You got kids? A dog? House plants?

28:49.874 --> 28:51.227
Nothing?

28:52.314 --> 28:55.909
Details just open the door.
- Open the door to what?

28:57.314 --> 29:01.671
It's not like we're strangers,
after all. We were married.

29:02.554 --> 29:05.068
We were not!
- There was a ceremony.

29:05.514 --> 29:07.869
He wasn't even a minister.
He was an astrologer!

29:08.314 --> 29:10.908
He was also a minister.
The Church of Universal Harmony.

29:11.354 --> 29:13.709
He was a Pisces. - You're a Pisces!
- It wasn't legal.

29:14.154 --> 29:16.873
In the eyes of Jeanne Dixon we're
married. - I was born on the cusp.

29:17.314 --> 29:18.793
We were happy.
- We were miserable.

29:19.234 --> 29:21.429
We were either scoring or coming down.
Mostly coming down.

29:21.874 --> 29:23.944
We had good times.

29:25.034 --> 29:26.387
Area.

29:28.194 --> 29:31.152
Out on the street,
dancing with friends...

29:31.714 --> 29:33.670
We were magical.

29:34.114 --> 29:36.833
You took off for 3 months
without telling me and called once.

29:37.274 --> 29:39.344
That's how magical we were.

29:40.194 --> 29:43.231
You were an encyclopedia
of suicidal fantasies. Every one.

29:43.674 --> 29:47.952
I mean, nobody
could clear a room like you, John.

29:49.434 --> 29:53.507
And the friends, you may have noticed,
turned out to be mine, not yours.

29:56.074 --> 29:59.908
I envy you. A convenient memory
is a gift from God.

30:00.354 --> 30:01.673
You exaggerate.

30:02.114 --> 30:05.948
In rehab it's called
"Euphoric Recall"... - We were happy.

30:06.954 --> 30:09.343
I was drowning.
- It wasn't me.

30:09.794 --> 30:14.106
You did nothing. I wasn't your
business. You still think like that.

30:14.554 --> 30:17.512
Actions have consequences.
So do inactions.

30:17.954 --> 30:19.785
I meant well.

30:21.754 --> 30:23.745
You always meant well.

30:26.154 --> 30:28.145
We were in love.

30:32.514 --> 30:34.709
We were happy.

30:42.434 --> 30:43.992
You bought it for me.

30:44.434 --> 30:46.072
It's inscribed inside.

30:54.114 --> 30:56.912
Ann's quitting,
I've gotta find something else to do.

30:57.354 --> 31:00.471
I'll believe it when I see it.
- No, it's true.

31:00.914 --> 31:02.745
Are you really straight?

31:04.474 --> 31:07.272
Yes.
- Let me see your eyes.

31:17.194 --> 31:19.150
Eyes are deceiving.

31:21.114 --> 31:22.706
Congratulations.

31:23.154 --> 31:25.588
If I could do that, I could do
anything. - What does that mean?

31:26.034 --> 31:29.310
We could do anything.
We could start all over again.

31:35.554 --> 31:39.945
I have to get back.
- You didn't touch your salad!

31:45.274 --> 31:47.230
Okay, I'll walk you back.

32:38.234 --> 32:40.031
May I help you, sir?

33:28.234 --> 33:32.386
What's on for tonight?
- Just some party.

33:35.034 --> 33:39.585
Have fun. I gotta get going.
- See you soon. - Bye-bye.

33:42.594 --> 33:44.983
I can always find
another way to make a living.

33:45.434 --> 33:49.313
I never planned this
in the first place. Not like Ann.

33:49.954 --> 33:52.991
She came up to sell,
have parties, make contacts.

33:53.434 --> 33:56.471
She was glamorous.
I just wanted to be around her.

33:56.914 --> 33:59.064
She'd sit up
listening to coke stories.

33:59.514 --> 34:01.470
Now it's me and Robert.

34:01.914 --> 34:05.953
The whole crowd was the same
age then. Everybody's younger now.

34:06.554 --> 34:08.465
She made me.

36:04.434 --> 36:08.109
You have any money saved?
- There's some. One or two thousand.

36:08.554 --> 36:12.342
Maybe more. - What do you do with all
your money? - It's not that much,

36:12.794 --> 36:15.467
as you know.
- It's tax free.

36:15.914 --> 36:20.305
The rent, Con Ed, phone, CD's...

36:21.114 --> 36:23.582
tips, just clothes, regular stuff.

36:24.354 --> 36:26.310
How about your money?

36:26.754 --> 36:31.464
Kitty Ford said: "The only person who
lives better than you is my Grandma!"

36:31.914 --> 36:33.029
I don't know.

36:39.954 --> 36:43.026
All the money I make I spend.
It just never adds up.

36:43.474 --> 36:46.113
And then the last 2 years this
cosmetics thing has taken everything.

36:46.554 --> 36:48.545
I wish I could help.

36:48.994 --> 36:52.543
You still going to meetings?
- No, but I'm okay.

36:55.794 --> 36:58.354
What are the odds of meeting someone

36:58.794 --> 37:01.547
that you haven't seen in years
twice in 2 days?

37:03.674 --> 37:06.108
If it's indicated in your house
of relationships, it's pretty high.

37:06.554 --> 37:08.226
You should have Robert do your chart.

37:08.674 --> 37:11.746
Who is the person?
- Just a contact. You don't know him.

37:14.794 --> 37:16.466
So what's the plan?

37:17.354 --> 37:19.390
What? The plan?

37:20.434 --> 37:24.905
The future. - My future?
- Why? Is that too conceptual for you?

37:25.354 --> 37:28.426
We had this conversation 2 years ago.
We're gonna have it again in 2 years.

37:28.874 --> 37:31.104
No, this time it's for real.

37:33.074 --> 37:38.785
I'm thinking about taking some music
courses. Sound editing, mixing...

37:39.234 --> 37:43.193
Didn't you already do that?
- No, that was acting.

37:44.034 --> 37:46.423
No. That was modeling.

37:46.994 --> 37:49.747
Yeah, you're right. I guess it was.

37:50.314 --> 37:52.464
You should try these berries.
They're flown in from someplace.

37:52.914 --> 37:55.382
Everything's flown in from someplace.
- Ann,

37:55.834 --> 37:57.790
is there something you want to say?

37:58.874 --> 38:00.910
What's up?

38:02.674 --> 38:05.029
I guess I'm a little worried.

38:05.474 --> 38:07.942
Everybody thinks I'm so tough.

38:09.474 --> 38:13.308
And you gotta be tough.
Especially in this business.

38:15.114 --> 38:18.231
It's one thing to look tough,
it's another to...

38:20.914 --> 38:22.905
I've seen Zipporah twice this week.

38:23.354 --> 38:26.505
Did she help you?
- She harmonizes and she...

38:26.954 --> 38:31.345
She's encouraging me to shift from,
you know, to the cosmetics thing.

38:32.354 --> 38:36.506
But if it doesn't work, is she gonna
pay for these berries? - Montrachet?

38:36.954 --> 38:39.309
It's a cash world!

38:41.954 --> 38:45.390
I know what I'm gonna do.
Maybe you should see Zipporah.

38:46.354 --> 38:49.710
No, I'm not into that stuff.
- What stuff?

38:55.474 --> 38:58.750
He's a big producer.

38:59.194 --> 39:02.470
Nominated for an Academy Award.
Best Picture.

39:02.914 --> 39:07.032
I used to know every girl he fucked.
Who, how. He couldn't take a shit...

39:07.714 --> 39:09.989
We were like this.

39:10.554 --> 39:14.911
His wife told him to get straight
or else she'd cut him off. Old money.

39:15.354 --> 39:18.107
I remember
the last thing he said to me:

39:18.794 --> 39:20.750
"We'll keep in touch. " Right.

39:21.194 --> 39:23.503
That was 5 years ago.

39:24.354 --> 39:25.423
Thanks.

39:27.594 --> 39:31.303
You'll still talk to me won't you?
- You?

39:32.034 --> 39:33.911
Of course I will.

39:40.234 --> 39:42.145
It's gonna be so weird

39:42.594 --> 39:45.028
without you around.
It kinda just hit me.

39:45.474 --> 39:48.272
We'll always have Paris.

39:48.874 --> 39:52.787
Ann, you want me, just call.

39:53.474 --> 39:56.671
Write a letter, tell a wino,
I'll be there.

41:47.394 --> 41:48.793
I'm sorry.

42:01.154 --> 42:03.748
I always thought
my father would die first.

42:04.274 --> 42:09.064
He would die, and then my mother and I
could reconcile. - It's like a joke.

42:10.074 --> 42:13.225
It's not a real feeling.
- My old man bawling in the hospital,

42:13.674 --> 42:17.303
me popping in and out of the john
getting loaded.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.666
I miss you.

42:36.794 --> 42:39.228
You tried to kill me.

42:40.274 --> 42:43.823
You took 10 years off my life,
one way or another.

42:46.634 --> 42:49.785
I couldn't hate my mother.
I was too busy hating you.

42:50.714 --> 42:55.310
I thought I was just killing myself.
Selfish.

42:57.114 --> 42:58.752
Excuse me.

42:59.194 --> 43:00.229
Excuse me!

43:00.994 --> 43:02.666
Excuse us.

43:05.634 --> 43:06.783
Let's go.

43:07.634 --> 43:08.703
Come with me.

43:55.314 --> 43:57.589
Have you ever had sex
totally straight?

44:01.074 --> 44:03.030
Not with you.

44:10.594 --> 44:12.346
That's quite an erection!

44:14.754 --> 44:17.666
I never had anything like it stoned.

44:23.714 --> 44:25.113
It's weird.

44:36.114 --> 44:37.832
I'm dripping.

44:39.754 --> 44:41.710
Let's disappear.

45:44.514 --> 45:46.186
You gotta go back?

45:52.514 --> 45:54.505
This is the end.

45:54.994 --> 45:58.464
It was wonderful
and I'm glad it happened this way.

45:58.914 --> 46:00.347
It will never happen again.

46:02.154 --> 46:05.863
You will not call me.
You will not see me again.

46:08.874 --> 46:11.513
I'm happy for you.

46:12.354 --> 46:14.026
I wish you the best.

46:14.754 --> 46:18.349
I'm leaving. I shouldn't have left
the hospital, but I don't regret it.

46:20.754 --> 46:25.066
Please get dressed and leave
as soon as you can. I have a key. Bye.

46:29.914 --> 46:31.427
It's my fault.

46:33.274 --> 46:34.593
I love you.

47:01.914 --> 47:03.586
Johnny, what is this?

47:05.034 --> 47:07.912
Your beeper broke?
You getting Shiatsu?

47:08.354 --> 47:10.151
2 hours! Where the fuck have you been?

47:10.594 --> 47:14.269
There was a mix-up. - How the hell
are you going to survive on your own?

47:14.714 --> 47:18.309
The UN has some conference in 2 days.
The holiday is over.

47:18.754 --> 47:22.064
Peacemakers all over the place trying
to score. UN security at every hotel.

47:22.514 --> 47:26.553
Even I have been out. Okay?
Look, this is where our business is:

47:27.234 --> 47:30.624
Europe, Asia, not the fucking streets!

47:31.074 --> 47:33.304
But you wouldn't know crack
from Cracker Jacks.

47:33.754 --> 47:36.188
Where's Robert? - He's out
busting his ass doing your job!

47:36.634 --> 47:39.467
It was a confusion.
- Well, get confused on your day off!

47:39.914 --> 47:42.712
And when is that? - Don't get wise
with me! What do you want me to do?

47:43.154 --> 47:47.033
Suck your dick? Fine!
You want a raise? Forget it!

47:49.474 --> 47:50.589
John, come here.

48:01.594 --> 48:03.152
Here are the call-ins.

48:03.594 --> 48:06.313
Get your ass out of here
before I kiss it!

48:07.674 --> 48:09.392
I'm sorry.

49:44.994 --> 49:47.508
Le Tour! Take a rest.

49:48.394 --> 49:50.464
You know Thomas. This is Gabri.

49:50.914 --> 49:54.987
Tasha. And I don't know who he is.

49:57.194 --> 50:00.231
How did it work out?
- What? - Saint Luke's.

50:00.674 --> 50:02.187
No problem.

50:02.634 --> 50:06.309
Can you believe it? She's out of the
hospital 1 day, wants to get together.

50:06.754 --> 50:10.030
Some people are just born for losing.
You want to go in the back?

50:10.474 --> 50:12.226
Not now. Look at the bar.

50:12.674 --> 50:14.983
Dark-haired guy,
late twenties, brown suit.

50:15.474 --> 50:18.910
He's casing you.
Undercover, whatever. He's on you.

50:19.354 --> 50:21.822
You been a bad boy?
- Fucking Nazis!

50:22.274 --> 50:24.504
You know him?
- Just a feeling.

50:24.954 --> 50:28.424
Forget it. It wasn't for me anyway.

50:29.954 --> 50:33.151
Make it tomorrow. A half,
no, 3 quarters. - 19 is the top.

50:33.594 --> 50:36.062
I can make 2 trips.
- 19 is fine.

50:39.314 --> 50:42.067
Okay, "a domani"! See you.
- Take care girls. Ciao!

50:51.940 --> 50:54.295
I feel my life turning.

50:54.740 --> 50:56.776
All it needed was direction.

50:57.220 --> 51:00.098
You drift from day to day,
years go by.

51:00.540 --> 51:04.579
Then a change comes.
I am able to change.

51:05.020 --> 51:07.215
I can be a good person.

51:07.660 --> 51:11.369
What a strange thing
to happen halfway through your life.

51:11.820 --> 51:13.253
What luck.

51:44.260 --> 51:47.013
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost, please.

51:47.460 --> 51:48.859
Just a moment.

51:49.900 --> 51:52.095
Welcome to the Paramount.
Your party is out.

51:52.540 --> 51:55.850
If you'd like to leave a message
for... - Marianne Jost.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.734
...please do so after the beep.

52:10.500 --> 52:12.889
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost, please.

52:13.340 --> 52:14.534
Just a moment.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.734
Welcome to the Paramount.
Your party is out.

52:19.180 --> 52:21.535
If you'd like to leave a message
for... - Marianne Jost.

52:21.980 --> 52:23.811
...please do so after the beep.

53:07.220 --> 53:10.212
Are you looking at me?
- No.

53:31.580 --> 53:34.458
Can I help you, Officer?
- What?

53:34.900 --> 53:38.609
I'm not making a mistake.
You are a cop, aren't you?

53:40.740 --> 53:42.492
Can I see your badge?

53:49.420 --> 53:51.456
Bill Guidone.
- What is it?

53:53.700 --> 53:56.453
You think you're invisible, don't you?

53:57.500 --> 54:01.459
You think we don't know you, Le Tour?
That's the name you use, right?

54:01.980 --> 54:05.575
My father's a partner
in a very powerful law firm.

54:06.020 --> 54:08.614
If you have anything in mind,
do it by the book.

54:11.580 --> 54:15.368
Who the fuck gives a shit about you?
I could grind you right here.

54:15.820 --> 54:18.334
In fact, maybe I will.
What do you think about that?

54:18.780 --> 54:20.930
Nobody would give a flying fuck.

54:21.380 --> 54:25.737
I look like narcotics? I'm homicide,
investigating the murder in the park.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.738
I don't read the papers.

54:29.980 --> 54:35.498
Downtown's interested how a
19-year-old student with fancy parents

54:35.940 --> 54:39.535
got a quarter of uncut coke on her
when she was found murdered.

54:39.980 --> 54:42.892
This ain't the type of girl we find
cruising Alphabet City to score.

54:43.340 --> 54:48.255
Know what I mean? Somebody sold her.
Somebody upscale. You're classy.

54:49.300 --> 54:51.131
So I hear.

54:52.540 --> 54:55.338
And maybe somebody knows
something we need to know.

54:55.780 --> 54:56.929
You understand?

54:58.380 --> 54:59.779
Delivery boy!

55:01.020 --> 55:05.696
Here's my card. You ask around.
Take a week or so. Call me.

55:06.140 --> 55:08.335
Tell me something
I don't already know.

55:08.780 --> 55:11.010
It's either that, leave town,

55:11.460 --> 55:14.418
or get your ass busted
day in, day out.

55:15.260 --> 55:16.375
Got it?

55:20.380 --> 55:21.574
Loser!

55:25.940 --> 55:30.092
Paramount Hotel.
- Marianne Jost.

55:32.020 --> 55:34.250
Just a moment. I'm sorry,
Miss Jost checked out this morning.

55:34.700 --> 55:36.577
Did she leave a forwarding number?

55:37.020 --> 55:38.851
No, she didn't.

55:39.620 --> 55:40.973
Thanks.

56:05.700 --> 56:09.852
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital.
- Mrs. Joanne Jost. She's a patient.

56:10.300 --> 56:12.211
Just a moment.

56:14.380 --> 56:16.291
Who is this calling?

56:17.340 --> 56:21.094
Skyline Floral.
We're checking on a delivery.

56:22.020 --> 56:24.329
Mrs. Jost passed away last night.

56:26.460 --> 56:30.055
Are the funeral arrangements local?
- Just a second.

56:31.140 --> 56:34.689
Yes, Plaza Memorial.
- Plaza Memorial. Thank you.

57:23.380 --> 57:24.733
Get out!

57:27.980 --> 57:31.256
Every time you come into my life
something terrible happens.

57:31.700 --> 57:33.930
I thought I was rid of you.

57:34.380 --> 57:37.178
What are you...? How did you...?
I don't want you here!

57:37.620 --> 57:40.134
I don't want you around!
I don't want you around my mother!

57:40.580 --> 57:44.573
Damn you! Just get out!
Get the fuck out of my life!

57:45.020 --> 57:47.454
Get out! Get out of here!

57:53.140 --> 57:56.212
I'm sorry, John. You shouldn't
have come. That's the way it is.

57:56.660 --> 58:01.609
She's been up all night crying. She
wasn't there when mother passed...

58:02.860 --> 58:05.090
...died. She blames herself.

58:05.540 --> 58:08.771
It wouldn't have made any difference.
She just slipped away.

58:09.220 --> 58:12.735
Marianne's... I'm worried about her.
- What do you give a shit about?

58:13.180 --> 58:14.295
God. Okay.

58:20.020 --> 58:22.056
It's...
- Don't try.

58:24.660 --> 58:28.130
How are you?
- Me? - Yeah, you.

58:29.540 --> 58:33.738
I can't think of anything, but if
there's anything I can do. - I'm okay.

58:34.180 --> 58:36.774
We've been expecting it.
It'll hit me later.

58:37.660 --> 58:39.651
I saw her.
- Who?

58:40.100 --> 58:44.298
Your mother. I came into the room.
You were sleeping.

58:52.940 --> 58:57.297
Well, I gotta get back because
Marianne's probably flipping out.

59:15.340 --> 59:19.379
Sweetheart! "Shu Mai" just delivered.
It's fabulous! Have a snack with us.

59:19.820 --> 59:21.173
No, thanks.

59:24.260 --> 59:26.649
I told Ann you'd be on time.

59:27.100 --> 59:31.810
Tis called. He said before 10.
He said you were right. - About what?

59:32.260 --> 59:34.012
Undercover cop, not a narc.

59:34.460 --> 59:39.215
The Park murder. Jealous was straight
on that. Hear anything more about it?

59:39.660 --> 59:44.529
Remember the time that cop came here?
Wanted to know if we had "nose candy"?

59:44.980 --> 59:49.451
And Ann says: "John Candy?"

59:51.500 --> 59:54.412
What's wrong, Baby?
You look like shit. Something's wrong.

59:54.860 --> 59:58.057
No, no, it's nothing.
- You can't fool me. I can read you.

59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.651
There's nothing to say.
You're leaving me.

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.890
After a few more months:
"Sayonara!" You too.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:13.176
John who? What the hell was his name?
It's not like I got a pension plan.

01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:15.815
Is that what you think?
You hate cosmetics!

01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.179
I know... - Who knows what'll happen?
- I got a friend. A D. D.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.978
Got into lapidary. I'll introduce you.
- What the hell is he talking about?

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.375
Gems!

01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.335
Crystals, diamonds...
- Anything more about the Park murder?

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:33.692
What is it with this?
- Stay away!

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.210
If you want to come in with us, fine!
We can make room.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.413
It's no big deal. There's room.
- It's not what I want.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.215
Well, that's what I said.
- This is Ed. You gotta come...

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:50.178
Damn it! Don't answer it! I don't want
to deal with it. - I'll handle it.

01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:54.813
If he gives you any shit, fuck him!
- I'm sorry. - Forget it.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.216
Don't forget about Tis.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:02.210
Ann needs that contact.
- Give it a rest.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.496
Eddie, come on!
- Fuck you, you scum!

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:08.408
Fuck you!
- You low life dealer!

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.330
Personally, I don't give a shit.
You can go kill yourself.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:16.898
I don't care. But you O. D. in here,
it's a problem for me.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.128
I put a hex on you, man!
- Fuck you! - Fuck you!

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:29.449
What are you doing? Gotta get
permission? Gotta check with Mama?

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.495
No, I'm calling your brother.
The lawyer up in Bronxville.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:37.899
I'm gonna tell him to come here.
You told me so much about him.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:43.650
Tour, you can't do this. Please!
I'll give you anything! Money...

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:50.255
Martin Jeer, please. Thanks.
- He doesn't understand!

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.418
I recommend Hazelton. It has the best
program. - Why are you doing this?

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.138
You're such an asshole! - Martin Jeer?
I'm here with your brother Ed.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:04.294
There's been a medical emergency.
You're gonna have to come.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.372
Yeah, he'll be here.

01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.169
Good evening. - Good evening, sir.
- I'm here to see Tis Bruge.

01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:54.937
Your name, sir?

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:57.372
John Le Tour.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.415
A mister John Le Tour
is here to see you, sir. Certainly.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.371
Penthouse, sir.
- Thank you.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.258
Tour!
- Thomas!

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.170
Evening, Tis. - Just in time.
We were out. 19, right?

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.889
That's 38, right?

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:58.808
You got any hundreds? - Some. Not
the whole thing. - You got hundreds?

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:04.371
I like that about Ann.
Always takes the time to grind it.

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:07.653
If you're going to do it,
do it right.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.220
Looks like you could use some help.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.857
Mari, this is Tour.
You got any hundreds?

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.413
Not the talkative type.
Haven't seen her for years.

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:39.930
You know her, don't you?

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:44.134
Why they call me...
What a nightmare!

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.938
You want it or not?
- Yeah.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.378
See you later?

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.569
Tell Ann I made that phone call
for her. It's all set up.

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.019
Marianne?

01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.529
Where to?

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:30.055
What?

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:33.493
Where to, sir? Where are we going?

01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.890
Nowhere just yet.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.092
Let's just wait.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.450
You want to wait here?

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.173
Downtown.

01:08:01.780 --> 01:08:02.769
Yes, sir.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:16.336
All news, all the time.
This is 1010 WINS.

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:21.178
You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.495
Here's what's happening:

01:08:23.939 --> 01:08:28.616
Seven people made off with 600, 000
dollars from the city program meant

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:34.657
to renovate old buildings. The money
renovated their bank accounts instead.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.216
More arrest warrants may be issued.
And this just in:

01:08:38.660 --> 01:08:44.212
A woman has fallen to her death.
Police are withholding identification.

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:48.618
The incident happened about 10 p. m.
According to the sources on the scene

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:54.180
there was no one else in the exclusive
Grace Towers apartment at the time.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.372
Is the sanitation strike over?

01:08:56.819 --> 01:09:01.689
A successful conclusion
of the negotiations is imminent.

01:09:25.899 --> 01:09:29.051
Who is it?
- It's John Le Tour.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.852
Can I see you? - What time is it?
- It's important, Theresa.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.859
You should call. Make an appointment.
- Open the door. You're up anyway.

01:09:40.300 --> 01:09:44.259
Do I know you?
- We had a session last week.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:52.339
What do you see?

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.892
Look at me.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.375
What do you see?

01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:59.931
Okay, just a minute.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:12.612
I see death.
- Someone I knew died tonight.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:19.451
This was not an accident. This person
was murdered. - Am I in danger?

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.458
The danger's around you.
It's very close.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.538
God, I'm tired.
- What should I do?

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:37.699
I don't know. I can't see it.
- Please.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.093
Is this it?

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.459
Has my luck run out?

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.295
No.

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:52.209
No, you're fine.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:55.970
Don't be afraid. Come on, go home.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:11:01.089
What do I owe you? - Nothing.
Forget it. Just let me sleep.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:03.212
You're fine.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:58.412
Ninth precinct.
- Bill Guidone, homicide.

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.377
Guidone.
- This is John Le Tour. Remember me?

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:08.017
Yeah, laundromat.
Your father's got big connections.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:13.454
You told me to tell you something you
didn't know. It ain't much, but still.

01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:19.892
A girl died last night. Lexington
Avenue. - Yeah, the jumper. Druggie.

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:25.460
The news said she was alone,
but she wasn't. It's a cover-up.

01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:28.972
There was someone else there.
- Who?

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:32.734
Who owns the apartment?

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:34.693
You there?

01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:40.850
That's all I know. You told me to tell
you something. I told you something.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:56.769
Manny!

01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:01.372
Le Tour. Jealous, "Jell". SOB's.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:04.139
Burning Spear.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:06.571
How did you get in?
- C.C.

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.533
You buying?
- How's product?

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:09.935
How much?

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:13.936
No, I got a problem. I need a piece.

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:17.258
Piece? Piece of what? Piece of candy?

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:21.898
A gun. - When?
- Now, anything.

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:25.970
Am I talking too fast?

01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:28.814
How much you spend?
- The rate.

01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:30.818
What've you got?

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:50.174
We got trade. Detective Special.
Nobody wants 'em. Got it from a cop.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.848
How much?

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.335
Four, including me.
- You're fucking me! - So what?

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:00.973
Where is it?

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.054
Come on.

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:16.214
The hundreds. Franklins.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.571
How do I use this thing?

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.809
It's a gun, man! - Yeah, but is there
something special I gotta know?

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:35.014
I've never used one of these before.
How do you do it? - Simple.

01:15:35.460 --> 01:15:41.137
Put the bullets in. Point it at the
bad guys. Pull the trigger. They fall.

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.934
Are you okay?

01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:07.812
Did you go to the police station?
- She was back on drugs.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:10.654
Really back.

01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:16.772
They're gonna bring her here too.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:22.652
I thought she was playing
for attention. - I didn't know.

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.809
You're not to blame.
You're not responsible.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.855
Look.

01:18:36.180 --> 01:18:38.648
Recognize anyone?
- That's Tis. - You know him?

01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:43.332
His father's a lawyer. He did Mom's
taxes. He was at the hospital.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:48.176
What is that smell?
- It's me. Cologne.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.896
I'm a sucker
for that cheap airplane-stuff.

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:57.938
Did she mention him yesterday?
- It was his apartment. Why?

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.095
I don't know.
- She jumped.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:10.453
I know you loved her, but...
I know this is gonna sound terrible,

01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:13.935
but she was... she ruined everything!

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.934
Bad luck.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.533
Sorry about last night.

01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.336
Our prodigal son!
- Something came up. T.C.T.E.

01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:03.092
T.C. what? - "Too Complicated
To Explain". I gotta show you this.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:09.452
I'm 400 short from last night.
You can take it out of my pay.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:13.779
Look, this is family. Do you want to
hurt my feelings? It's not money.

01:20:15.380 --> 01:20:19.817
We had a graphic artist make it up.
You know Billy. Five Towns.

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.539
Oh, sure. Classy! Very Katmandu.
- Kath-mandu! - Whatever.

01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:27.291
Well, it's good. I like it. It's nice.

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:33.735
Tis called twice. He wants you
to come by. - I don't want to go.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.138
The suicide and all.
I think we should stay away.

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:42.131
Can't. He's the connect. I don't
wanna fuck with this. - Oh, come on.

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:44.810
Johnny, it's business.

01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:49.450
Let Robert go. - Tis doesn't deal
with fags. - Since when?

01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:53.939
Since always. So he's a bigot!
So what? So's everybody!

01:20:55.180 --> 01:20:59.458
I don't want to go. I got a bad vibe.

01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:04.059
He said you.

01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.569
Why?

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.251
You go. He's your contact.

01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:16.215
He is.
- You giving orders? - No, Missy.

01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:21.257
Come with me. The two of us.

01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:27.455
Sure.

01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:29.379
Why not?

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:38.176
For old times' sake. Ann and Johnny.

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.695
Stop it!

01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.251
You're breaking my heart.

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.608
Robert, call the car.

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:07.215
It's gonna be strange not doing this.
I've had it, I'm fed up, but...

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:12.017
You're really gonna do it? You're
really gonna quit? - I think so.

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:17.454
I'll seal this thing with Tis, turn it
over and put everything in cosmetics.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.936
You gotta take chances in life.
No risk, no gain, as they say.

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:26.134
Anyway, I've got my retail connections
here and in Europe.

01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:30.537
It was great when
we started out, though, wasn't it?

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.658
Greene Street years.

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:35.898
Before deliveries.
When you were still using.

01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.216
I should write a book.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.699
Did It tell you somebody asked
actually to ghostwrite my story?

01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.129
But...

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:51.938
My lawyer freaked. I even took the
meeting. Of course it was impossible.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.610
Everybody thinks
I've got such a glamorous life.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:59.053
But they don't know.
I mean, you know. Glamorous, yeah.

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:04.450
It was, actually. Once, before
crack came and fucked everything.

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.575
I gotta stop at my place for a second.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.854
It's out of the way. You're expected.
- I got a bad vibe about Tis.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.249
Chill on this, will you? It's routine.
- I wanna get my lucky jacket.

01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:13.054
Did you douche while you were
at it? - You got some mouth on you!

01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:16.179
You don't want to know
where it's been.

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.734
You got cologne on? Smells like the
stuff on airplanes. - It's for you.

01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:26.654
Don't use it. It's got chemicals
in it. It's terrible for the skin.

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:28.935
What are you doing?

01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:33.931
Do me a favor. - What?
- Don't ask why. Promise?

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.731
Promise?
- What?

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:42.331
If anything should happen to me

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.293
write her and tell her.

01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:47.935
She's my sister.

01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.850
Her husband's in San Quentin.
She worries.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:23.338
I thought we were going to Tis'.

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.695
He's here. You can't expect him to be
at his apartment after what happened.

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:14.937
Mathis Bruge, please.

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.051
Tis? This is Ann.

01:27:23.700 --> 01:27:25.691
Yeah, I'm here with Tour.

01:27:27.980 --> 01:27:29.299
Tis there?

01:27:54.100 --> 01:27:55.089
Voilà!

01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:15.889
So where's Tis?

01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:24.169
Ann.

01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:39.329
I told you greasy fucks, no guns!
When I see a fucking gun, I walk!

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:44.137
How fucking dare you? I don't know
who you are, but kiss my fat ass!

01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.013
Tis, you shitball!

01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.292
Where are you? I know you're in there.

01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:54.258
Goddamn it! If you want to deal with
me, you owe me a fucking apology.

01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:58.017
Let's go.
- Hold it. Stop right there!

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.255
No.

01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.977
Sorry about the guns. - What the fuck
are you doing this macho shit for?

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:09.857
For emphasis. To make a point.
- Oh, please! - My fuck up.

01:29:10.300 --> 01:29:12.291
I apologize.

01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.417
Assholes. - Really?
- What a nightmare!

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:21.170
We'll take care
of that thing tomorrow. Same terms.

01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:23.689
Sorry.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:29.736
Go on, leave. You're upset. I just
need to talk to Tour about the police.

01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:32.929
Tour and I
need to get our stories straight.

01:29:33.380 --> 01:29:35.257
Somebody's talking to the police.

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:41.293
I'm sorry, Ann.
I just have to talk to Tis.

01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.176
Go down. I'll meet you at the car.

01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:48.850
We came together,
we're leaving together. Come on.

01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.255
Thomas.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:55.254
Don't be stupid. Get out! Leave!

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:00.456
I had nothing to do with Marianne.
She jumped.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.050
She was there and she was gone.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.175
Nothing will happen to Tour.

01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:08.379
Go on, Ann.

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.009
Fire!

01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:13.971
Don't be crazy.

01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:18.297
Stop now. Stop, please.

01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.255
Believe me.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:24.535
I...

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:28.451
I didn't have anything to do with...

01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:24.089
Teal.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:26.895
Jones.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.215
And Le Tour.

01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:47.695
We got 20 minutes.

01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:51.738
You look terrific.
- I look respectable.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.452
So what's the news?

01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:57.494
Sentencing's
supposed to be in 10 days.

01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:02.855
Because of circumstances and our
cooperation, no more than 5 years.

01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:04.773
Maybe 7.

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:08.210
It hasn't been so bad.

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.936
It's a relief in a way. So far.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.289
I've been writing.

01:33:16.940 --> 01:33:19.534
And reading.
- I love your letters.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:23.131
Good. - I didn't know
you could write like that.

01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.299
How's business?

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:28.977
Is it still "Akasha"?
- It's still "Akasha".

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:32.697
Robert quit. He went back to dealing.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:37.258
I guess he thought
he'd make more money and work less.

01:33:37.700 --> 01:33:42.490
It's lucky I'm involved in the
enquiry because now I have to quit.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:45.808
It's cosmetics after all.

01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:51.859
Did we ever fuck?

01:33:52.580 --> 01:33:53.535
What?

01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:57.890
You know, make love?

01:33:59.180 --> 01:34:02.297
There was the Christmas party.
Everybody got so stoned...

01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:03.695
No.

01:34:05.420 --> 01:34:10.210
You crashed at my place once and we
slept together. - We were naked?

01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:11.615
But?

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.813
We tried.

01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:18.896
I was thinking about it

01:34:19.700 --> 01:34:22.692
and I realized we never really did.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:26.658
It's one of the things I think about.

01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:31.253
One of the things I look forward to.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:35.258
I've been looking forward.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:37.493
Me, too.

01:34:42.820 --> 01:34:45.539
Strange how things work.

01:35:19.542 --> 01:35:26.542
