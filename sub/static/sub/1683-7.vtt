12:30.240 --> 12:31.908

12:31.942 --> 12:35.511
The Masons are the
traditional guardians of secrets

12:35.546 --> 12:38.247

for the side of good.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.084

in their possession.

12:42.119 --> 12:44.420
When the Horseman came
last time,

his skull, the other three

the end of days,

12:53.363 --> 12:55.431

12:55.465 --> 12:57.433
We must retrieve his head
before he does.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.302
And this time...

12:59.336 --> 13:01.103
we destroy it.

13:08.645 --> 13:11.047

Sir,

13:36.306 --> 13:37.773
I'll take care of it.

13:37.808 --> 13:39.241
It'll never come back to you.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.243
I don't have it.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.046
I sent the skull out
to another lab.

13:44.081 --> 13:45.715
CRANE:
Marlene Ramsay,

13:45.749 --> 13:47.984
have you informed her
of her husband's passing?

13:48.018 --> 13:49.986
Yes.

13:52.656 --> 13:55.458
During the war,
I personally informed the family

13:55.492 --> 13:57.727
when a soldier
in my regiment was killed.

13:57.761 --> 13:59.996
There is no worse feeling
than telling someone

14:00.030 --> 14:01.731
their loved one's gone.

14:01.765 --> 14:04.133
Especially
when it's under your watch.

14:06.169 --> 14:07.970
The Horseman will kill
every night

14:08.005 --> 14:09.505
until he gets what he came for.

14:09.539 --> 14:13.142
And you'll have to make
that call over and over again.

14:16.346 --> 14:18.581
You've come this far, sir.

14:18.615 --> 14:20.616
You need to trust us.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.284
(knocking, door opens)

14:22.319 --> 14:24.086
The D.A.'s on line one.

14:25.122 --> 14:28.124
I'll call her from the car.

14:28.158 --> 14:32.028
Stick around.
I won't be gone long.

14:37.134 --> 14:39.135
(muffled music playing)

14:40.637 --> 14:43.305
Paul?

14:56.753 --> 14:59.155
Hey.
Thanks for coming in so late.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.291
No problem. Unfortunately,

15:02.325 --> 15:04.460
we still can't figure out
what kind of processes

15:04.494 --> 15:06.395
were done to the skull.

15:06.430 --> 15:09.298
We put it through the woodwork.
(grunts)

15:09.332 --> 15:11.834
Biopsy came back unreadable,

15:11.868 --> 15:14.336
so we ran cytology:

15:14.371 --> 15:16.372
nothing. PCR?

15:16.406 --> 15:18.040
Still nothing.

15:18.075 --> 15:19.308
I'm running carbon dating,

15:19.342 --> 15:20.743
but that takes
a few more weeks.

15:20.777 --> 15:21.844
There's so much more to test.

15:21.878 --> 15:24.046
No definable cell structure,

15:24.081 --> 15:25.848
no DNA markers--

15:25.882 --> 15:28.484
it's been scrubbed
of any sign of life.

15:28.518 --> 15:29.985
And yet, there it is.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.520
Do you have a box?

15:39.229 --> 15:41.230
(sputters)

15:49.975 --> 15:52.277
I know we got the right size box
in here somewhere.

15:52.397 --> 15:55.646
If you don't have a box,
I'll take a bag.

16:00.152 --> 16:02.620
(automatic gunfire)

16:11.029 --> 16:12.330
Oh, my God.

16:13.499 --> 16:16.367
(gunshots)

16:30.215 --> 16:31.315
(cocks shotgun)

16:32.284 --> 16:33.751
(cocks shotgun)

16:42.594 --> 16:45.530
(cocks shotgun)
I got you, you headless son of a bitch.

16:45.564 --> 16:47.498
(hissing)

16:53.872 --> 16:55.873
(thunder rumbles)

17:01.880 --> 17:03.681
(starts engine)

17:09.755 --> 17:11.188
(tires screech)

17:13.425 --> 17:15.726
(horse neighs)
(tires screeching)

17:18.797 --> 17:20.731
(thunder rumbles)

17:22.901 --> 17:26.704
I wanted to call my guys
in Manhattan and hunt him down.

17:26.738 --> 17:30.608
But local PD says all the
surveillance cameras at the lab

17:30.642 --> 17:32.577
cut out. There's
no evidence

17:32.611 --> 17:33.644
of the Horseman.
It's like

17:33.679 --> 17:35.246
at the precinct with Brooks.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.447
They can't be seen
until they want

17:36.481 --> 17:38.482
to be seen.
It's all true?

17:38.517 --> 17:40.551
Everything you told me
from day one?

17:40.586 --> 17:43.387
This is insane.
He murdered Paul

17:43.422 --> 17:45.723
in front of me.

17:45.757 --> 17:47.925
I need to... fill out a report.

17:47.960 --> 17:49.594
I need to call the governor.

17:49.628 --> 17:50.761
What are you going to tell him?

17:50.796 --> 17:51.762
What do you think
I'm gonna tell him?

17:51.797 --> 17:53.064
A headless horseman

17:53.098 --> 17:56.067
is mowing people down
to bring about the end of days?

17:56.101 --> 17:58.235
For further questions,
please call Ichabod Crane,

17:58.270 --> 17:59.637
the man who beheaded him
in 1781.

17:59.671 --> 18:01.973
It was a mere inquiry.

18:02.007 --> 18:04.108
You wanted proof.

18:04.142 --> 18:07.645
Honestly...

18:07.679 --> 18:09.947
I wanted it to be a lie.

18:13.218 --> 18:15.152
Well, we got him.

18:15.187 --> 18:17.622
Now let's destroy it.

18:27.165 --> 18:29.634
How rare to stare

18:29.668 --> 18:31.636
into the face of Death.

18:33.505 --> 18:36.674
It's something I never intend
to do again.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.349
(bubbling, sizzling)

19:07.272 --> 19:09.040
(explosion)

19:14.546 --> 19:17.114
There's a junkyard in Tarrytown

19:17.149 --> 19:19.116
with an industrial
car compactor.

19:19.151 --> 19:21.919
I've seen it turn an SUV
into an ice cube.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.121
If it can't crush the skull,
nothing can.

19:24.156 --> 19:26.657
The myriad of destructive
devices you have in this century

19:26.692 --> 19:28.693
is remarkable.

19:30.262 --> 19:32.930
It's late.

19:32.964 --> 19:36.701
They weren't there earlier.

19:37.803 --> 19:38.769
Is that common?

19:38.804 --> 19:41.072
Four lanterns lit in a carport?

19:41.106 --> 19:42.139
Don't know.

19:42.174 --> 19:43.607
Probably not.

19:43.642 --> 19:46.343
Why?
In my day, Paul Revere developed a system:

19:46.378 --> 19:48.145
one lantern,
the enemy comes by land.

19:48.180 --> 19:49.313
Two, they come by sea.

19:49.347 --> 19:51.148
Paul Revere, midnight ride.

19:51.183 --> 19:53.150
"One if by land, two if by sea."

19:53.185 --> 19:54.952
You've heard of it?

19:54.986 --> 19:57.121
Word may have gotten around.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.156
What does four lanterns mean?

20:22.047 --> 20:24.181
Why would the Horseman do this?

20:25.517 --> 20:29.820
The Masons believe their minds
are akin to a temple.

20:29.855 --> 20:32.323
A sacred, holy place.

20:34.493 --> 20:38.496
We're tampering with his head
and he's responding in kind.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.001
He lined the heads with silver.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.939
Is it... along the top
of the skull?

20:52.644 --> 20:54.612
Does that mean something to you?

20:54.646 --> 20:57.615
Paul Revere utilized
the same technique

20:57.649 --> 21:00.317
the night the Crown arrived
in the colonies.

21:00.352 --> 21:04.188
<i>In 1775 Paul Revere lined</i>
<i>the lanterns with silver</i>

21:04.222 --> 21:05.623
<i>to enhance their illumination.</i>

21:05.657 --> 21:08.125
<i>I was guarding the safe house</i>

21:08.160 --> 21:12.429
<i>where Sam Adams and John</i>
<i>Hancock were evading arrest.</i>

21:12.464 --> 21:14.298
<i>When I alerted Adams</i>
<i>that the Crown was coming</i>

21:14.332 --> 21:18.035
<i>by sea, I observed him hand</i>
<i>Paul Revere a document,</i>

21:18.069 --> 21:21.472
<i>a continuous manuscript kept</i>
<i>by the Masons containing</i>

21:21.506 --> 21:23.707
<i>enemy secrets that could be</i>
<i>used to defeat the Crown.</i>

21:23.742 --> 21:24.909
<i>There was a symbol</i>

21:24.943 --> 21:28.913
on the manuscript,
a demonic heptagram.

21:28.947 --> 21:30.347
I've seen it in Corbin's files.

21:30.382 --> 21:34.685
It's a star within a star.

21:34.719 --> 21:37.054
ABBIE: <i>The Devil's trap--
I've seen it, too.</i>

21:37.088 --> 21:40.357
<i>But it's a symbol used</i>
<i>to entrap and defeat demons.</i>

21:40.392 --> 21:41.559
Why would that be
on a manuscript

21:41.593 --> 21:43.260
containing enemy secrets?

21:43.295 --> 21:44.762
Maybe they weren't
secrets of the Crown.

21:44.796 --> 21:46.897
They were secrets
for conquering evil.

21:49.301 --> 21:51.302
My God.

21:53.004 --> 21:54.605
The Horseman of Death was there

21:54.639 --> 21:56.140
that night.

21:56.174 --> 21:57.875
Where?

21:57.909 --> 22:01.345
CRANE: <i>Paul Revere told us of an
enemy assailant who chased him</i>

22:01.379 --> 22:03.113
on his ride into Lexington.

22:03.148 --> 22:05.015
<i>He believed it was</i>

22:05.050 --> 22:08.118
<i>a cold-blooded mercenary</i>
<i>for the Crown, but...</i>

22:09.788 --> 22:11.956
But it was Death himself.

22:15.493 --> 22:17.061
He was after the manuscript.

22:17.095 --> 22:19.196
It must contain
a secret about him,

22:19.231 --> 22:22.466
uh, his weakness or flaw.

22:22.500 --> 22:25.302
Do you think that it was updated
after you cut off his head?

22:25.337 --> 22:26.537
I do.

22:29.241 --> 22:30.741
I'd wager that's the information

22:30.775 --> 22:32.679
the Masons wanted
to share with us.

22:32.799 --> 22:34.685
We got to find that manuscript.

22:42.246 --> 22:46.149
Tarrytown Museum
of Colonial History.

22:46.183 --> 22:48.418
This venue holds
the manuscript?

22:48.452 --> 22:51.287
Amongst other
historical artifacts.

22:51.321 --> 22:52.889
This might be your happy place.

22:52.923 --> 22:54.123
GUIDE:
Paul Revere

22:54.158 --> 22:57.160
was a Renaissance man--
a silversmith,

22:57.194 --> 22:59.996
an early industrialist, and even

23:00.030 --> 23:02.231
a highly acclaimed dentist.

23:02.266 --> 23:04.734
All right, kids, follow me.

23:04.768 --> 23:07.437
It's apocryphal, what this man
is telling these children.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.805
Let it go.

23:08.839 --> 23:10.440
Uh...

23:19.650 --> 23:22.118
Were you charged a fee
for that water?

23:22.152 --> 23:24.587
My God, it should be
an inalienable right.

23:24.621 --> 23:26.923
Where do the courts fall on this?
GUIDE: Gather round.

23:26.957 --> 23:28.925
Uh...Wait. 
And make sure everybody can see.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.693
Now, while Revere was,

23:30.727 --> 23:32.995
well, revered

23:33.030 --> 23:35.031
for his many talents,
he is most famous

23:35.065 --> 23:37.934
for what historical event?

23:37.968 --> 23:40.369
CHILDREN: The midnight ride.
That's right.

23:40.404 --> 23:44.340
In fact, many refer to it
as Paul Revere's midnight ride

23:44.374 --> 23:46.275
since he was
the first patriot to yell

23:46.310 --> 23:47.944
"The British are coming!"
as he rode into Concord.

23:47.978 --> 23:49.111
Uh, pardon the interruption,

23:49.146 --> 23:50.847
but Paul Revere never arrived
in Concord.

23:50.881 --> 23:53.850
That was
Samuel Prescott's route,

23:53.884 --> 23:57.286
and the warning all the riders
gave, as discreetly as possible,

23:57.321 --> 24:01.924
was "The Regulars are coming,"
not "The British are coming."

24:01.959 --> 24:03.559
See, we, too,
were British at the time

24:03.594 --> 24:05.728
so that would have been
most unhelpful.

24:05.762 --> 24:06.963
Did you just say "we"?

24:06.997 --> 24:08.698
Excuse us.

24:08.732 --> 24:11.567
My cousin Steve forgot to take
his medication this morning.

24:11.602 --> 24:12.935
Didn't you, Steve?
I'm the only one amongst you

24:12.970 --> 24:14.210
who doesn't require medication.

24:16.940 --> 24:18.508
A highly acclaimed dentist.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.543
The man was a silversmith.

24:20.577 --> 24:22.845
That's the last person you want
poking around in your mouth.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.081
So I spoke to one
of the curators.

24:25.115 --> 24:26.516
I have good news and bad news.

24:26.550 --> 24:27.683
What do you want first?

24:27.718 --> 24:28.851
Is this a riddle?

24:28.886 --> 24:30.953
Never mind.

24:30.988 --> 24:32.488
Bad news:
the manuscript's on loan

24:32.523 --> 24:33.656
to the National Army Museum

24:33.690 --> 24:35.157
in London.

24:35.192 --> 24:36.325
London.
Mm-hmm.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.561
That's a three-month voyage
by sea.

24:38.595 --> 24:40.229
That's where
the good news comes in.

24:40.264 --> 24:41.998
They've uploaded
the manuscript online.

24:42.032 --> 24:44.333
That is excellent news.

24:44.368 --> 24:46.602
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

24:46.637 --> 24:47.737
No, I do not.

24:53.544 --> 24:55.511
Oh, uh...

24:55.546 --> 24:56.512
(tapping keyboard)

24:56.547 --> 24:58.381
(murmuring)

24:59.550 --> 25:01.684
I really hope you're right
about this manuscript.

25:01.718 --> 25:04.420
12 hours until the
Horseman rides again.

25:05.656 --> 25:09.559
Uh, Lieutenant, I've done
something catastrophic.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.271
You printed this five times.

25:22.306 --> 25:23.439
Correct.

25:23.473 --> 25:24.607
Why?

25:24.641 --> 25:26.242
In case the picture
vanishes from the screen

25:26.276 --> 25:27.977
like it did a moment ago.

25:35.485 --> 25:38.654
The manuscript-- written
in some kind of code.

25:40.691 --> 25:42.758
Adams would have used
a Vigenère cipher.

25:45.429 --> 25:47.830
I vaguely remember that
from Criminology 101.

25:47.864 --> 25:49.298
It's similar
to a Caesar shift cipher,

25:49.333 --> 25:51.567
but instead of shifting
the alphabet based on a letter,

25:51.602 --> 25:53.169
it's based on a word.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.905
A Vigenère cipher is several
Caesar ciphers in a sequence

25:55.939 --> 25:57.473
with different shift values.

25:57.507 --> 26:00.076
Therefore,
without the code word,

26:00.110 --> 26:02.345
the text is impossible
to decrypt.

26:02.379 --> 26:04.513
Oh, so you're looking
for a password?

26:04.548 --> 26:08.017
This is definitely
your area of expertise.

26:08.051 --> 26:09.251
Flummoxed by a foreign concept

26:09.286 --> 26:12.021
that resembles close to nothing
of what you know?

26:12.055 --> 26:14.423
Can't imagine how that feels.

26:17.194 --> 26:20.329
(ringtone playing)

26:20.364 --> 26:22.331
I'm trying to crack a
very complicated code.

26:22.366 --> 26:23.799
Is that noise going to cease?

26:23.834 --> 26:26.268
I must have quietude
to concentrate.

26:26.303 --> 26:27.603
Calm down.

26:27.638 --> 26:29.705
I'm gonna make a quick call,

26:29.740 --> 26:32.708
uh, give you some privacy.

26:32.743 --> 26:34.176
If you're going
to annul an engagement

26:34.211 --> 26:35.811
with a man who works
across the street,

26:35.846 --> 26:38.681
don't you think
you should do it in person?

26:38.715 --> 26:40.483
How do you know I'm meeting
with Luke later?

26:40.517 --> 26:43.119
You're much easier to read
than a Vigenère cipher.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.658
(indistinct radio transmissions)

26:48.692 --> 26:50.693
(phone ringing)

26:55.132 --> 26:56.832
BROOKS (distorted):
<i>There are others like me.</i>

26:56.867 --> 26:58.000
<i>Except for the chosen few.</i>

26:58.035 --> 26:59.301
<i>There's a war going on,</i>
<i>Morales.</i>

27:02.572 --> 27:03.806
<i>Watching.</i>

27:03.840 --> 27:04.807
<i>I saw you with Abbie Mills.</i>

27:04.841 --> 27:05.975
<i>Waiting.</i>

27:06.977 --> 27:08.778
(ringtone playing)

27:08.812 --> 27:10.613
<i>Stay away from her.</i>

27:10.647 --> 27:13.282
(ringtone playing)

27:13.316 --> 27:14.850
<i>I trust you'll make</i>
<i>the right decision.</i>

27:15.686 --> 27:18.220
(ringtone playing)

27:18.255 --> 27:20.156
<i>Stay away from Abbie Mills.</i>

27:20.190 --> 27:21.957
<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>that can protect her.</i>

27:21.992 --> 27:23.292
(ringtone playing)

27:27.898 --> 27:29.632
Hey, this is Luke.
Leave me a message.

27:29.666 --> 27:30.833
Hey, Luke, it's Abbie.

27:30.867 --> 27:32.702
I know we were supposed
to have coffee today,

27:32.736 --> 27:34.003
but something just came up

27:34.037 --> 27:35.871
and I'm not gonna be able
to make it,

27:35.906 --> 27:37.740
so give me a call
when you get this

27:37.774 --> 27:41.310
and we'll figure out
another time.

27:41.344 --> 27:42.745
Okay.

27:42.779 --> 27:45.314
Okay, talk soon.

27:49.619 --> 27:51.220
(Brooks groans)

27:51.254 --> 27:53.222
Andy?

27:54.124 --> 27:56.025
You're supposed to be dead.

27:56.059 --> 27:58.360
(crunches)

27:58.395 --> 28:00.362
(grunts)

28:00.397 --> 28:02.765
I am dead.

28:02.799 --> 28:05.534
Is that not apparent?

28:06.570 --> 28:11.107
Brooks... what happened?

28:11.141 --> 28:13.909
Abbie, I'm, I'm stuck.

28:15.746 --> 28:18.380
I want this to end,
but he won't let me.

28:18.415 --> 28:20.616
You sold your soul?

28:20.650 --> 28:24.353
I know you don't believe me,
but I'm trying to protect you.

28:26.256 --> 28:28.257
(tapping keyboard)

28:35.465 --> 28:37.133
Well, how did we get here?

28:39.503 --> 28:42.104
Well, that is wildly
inappropriate.

28:42.139 --> 28:43.839
Hey, sexy.
(grunts)

28:43.874 --> 28:45.441
Want to chat?

28:45.475 --> 28:46.675
(clears throat)

28:46.710 --> 28:48.844
Well, I'm flattered, madam,

28:48.879 --> 28:51.747
but I'm afraid
I am espoused to another.

28:51.782 --> 28:53.816
Ooh.

29:01.346 --> 29:02.993
Still here.

29:30.987 --> 29:33.989
♪

29:40.363 --> 29:42.865
Cicero is the password.

29:43.900 --> 29:47.703
Oh, Revere, you rum beggar.

29:49.072 --> 29:52.041
You hid the password
on the back of his teeth.

29:59.693 --> 30:01.427
The Horseman won't
stop coming after you

30:01.461 --> 30:03.262
until he gets his head.

30:03.296 --> 30:05.598
Well, that's not gonna happen.

30:05.632 --> 30:08.167
Horseman's indestructible,
Abbie, he is Death.

30:08.201 --> 30:10.269
We're getting that idea,
thank you.

30:10.303 --> 30:11.537
That's what I'm here
to tell you.

30:11.571 --> 30:15.141
You can't kill Death,
but you can trap him.

30:15.175 --> 30:17.743
That's the only way
you can defeat him.

30:19.513 --> 30:21.480
ABBIE:
<i>How?</i>

30:21.515 --> 30:24.116
BROOKS:
<i>I don't know.</i>

30:24.151 --> 30:26.485
<i>I just know it's a secret</i>
<i>he doesn't want let out.</i>

30:26.520 --> 30:27.820
Brilliant.

30:27.854 --> 30:29.555
Why should I believe
anything that you say?

30:29.589 --> 30:30.990
Because I care
about you, Abbie.

30:35.529 --> 30:37.530
Is that the sheriff's turncoat?

30:37.532 --> 30:39.765
Andy Boks.

30:39.799 --> 30:41.634
My name is Andy Brooks.

30:41.668 --> 30:44.069
We saw you die in that cell.

30:44.104 --> 30:45.804
Yeah.

30:46.706 --> 30:49.074
It's not my best day.

30:53.046 --> 30:55.447
Are you still in communication
with the Horseman?

30:55.482 --> 31:00.152
I am... but that's
not why I'm here.

31:00.187 --> 31:01.687
I want to help Abbie.

31:04.691 --> 31:06.592
Here's how you can help.

31:06.626 --> 31:09.428
Deliver this message
to the Horseman:

31:09.462 --> 31:11.497
if he wants his head back,

31:11.531 --> 31:14.300
he can meet me at the cemetery
when night falls.

31:17.904 --> 31:21.607
Okay, I'll tell him.

31:23.109 --> 31:26.245
If you return here,
there will be consequences.

31:26.279 --> 31:27.479
Do you understand?

31:27.514 --> 31:30.049
Don't threaten me.

31:42.062 --> 31:45.064
You all right?

31:45.098 --> 31:47.066
(sighs)

31:47.100 --> 31:48.634
(cocks gun)

31:48.668 --> 31:50.636
He said the Horseman
can't be killed.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.571
Only trapped.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.573
He's right.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.909
And I think I know how.

31:56.943 --> 31:59.845
I cracked the code.

31:59.879 --> 32:01.847
You've got crazy
good handwriting.

32:01.881 --> 32:03.282
This?

32:03.316 --> 32:05.017
Chicken scratch.

32:05.019 --> 32:07.886
There is a lot of useful
information in this manuscript.

32:07.921 --> 32:11.390
I'm not surprised the Horseman
wanted it destroyed.

32:11.424 --> 32:14.860
<i>1782, the Masons updated</i>
<i>this manuscript</i>

32:14.894 --> 32:17.096
<i>with a way to defeat</i>
<i>the Horseman of Death.</i>

32:17.130 --> 32:20.266
<i>Then Paul Revere engraved the</i>
<i>key to decoding the manuscript,</i>

32:20.300 --> 32:22.868
<i>the word "Cicero," in the back</i>
<i>of the Horseman's teeth.</i>

32:22.902 --> 32:25.437
What did he say about
the Horseman, post-beheading?

32:25.472 --> 32:27.406
(papers rustling)

32:27.440 --> 32:29.575
"Death cannot be slain,

32:29.609 --> 32:33.279
"but it can be captured and
caged against its fiery will.

32:33.313 --> 32:35.114
"As sunlight is
his only weakness,

32:35.148 --> 32:36.749
"a witch must be summoned

32:36.783 --> 32:38.584
"to cast a spell,
transforming the moon

32:38.618 --> 32:41.420
into the sun,
whilst Death is exposed."

32:41.454 --> 32:43.889
Great. We need a witch.

32:43.923 --> 32:46.558
Too bad we can't
summon your wife.

32:46.593 --> 32:50.062
Yes, the thought
had crossed my mind, thank you,

32:50.096 --> 32:52.965
though not as a means
to defeat our present enemy.

32:52.999 --> 32:56.268
Sorry. Understood.

32:56.303 --> 33:01.473
Perhaps there are still witches
in Sleepy Hollow?

33:04.411 --> 33:06.111
Lieutenant?

33:06.146 --> 33:08.113
When Adams wrote
in this manuscript,

33:08.148 --> 33:11.784
witches were the only means
of creating sunlight at night.

33:11.818 --> 33:15.220
But today, we have UV light,
ultraviolet

33:15.255 --> 33:17.156
light, also known as
artificial sunlight.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.892
It's the modern version of
what Adams was talking about.

33:19.926 --> 33:21.994
We can simulate the sun.

33:23.663 --> 33:26.799
Well, as long as it doesn't
include the Internet,

33:26.833 --> 33:28.467
then, I'm amenable.

33:28.501 --> 33:31.103
(slurping loudly through straw)

33:31.137 --> 33:33.005
Aah!

33:33.039 --> 33:34.940
(laughing):
Stop!

33:36.710 --> 33:39.578
No excuses.

33:40.814 --> 33:42.581
You guys have had straws
for a millennium.

33:42.615 --> 33:46.285
Mm. This water was free
at the market.

33:46.319 --> 33:48.654
So was the arsenic
that comes with it.

33:50.857 --> 33:52.991
So, we have to lure him
into the tunnels.

33:53.026 --> 33:54.193
Any ideas?

33:54.227 --> 33:55.694
A few.

33:55.729 --> 33:56.962
Though they require supplies

33:56.996 --> 33:58.997
which could take
some time to prepare.

33:59.032 --> 34:01.133
I'm not sure
they'll be completed by sundown.

34:01.167 --> 34:03.102
What if we got help?

34:03.136 --> 34:05.170
IRVING:
<i>Assuming this works,</i>

34:05.205 --> 34:07.639
which is generous,
say we trap him.

34:07.674 --> 34:09.675
Where are we gonna keep him?

34:09.708 --> 34:11.810
I'm not dropping him
in the drunk tank.

34:11.844 --> 34:12.945
The Masons have a cell protected

34:12.978 --> 34:14.813
by a supernatural
barrier, designed

34:14.848 --> 34:15.981
by Thomas Jefferson.

34:16.014 --> 34:17.683
Jefferson. Huh.

34:17.717 --> 34:19.818
What was he like?

34:19.853 --> 34:21.887
Oh, a true Renaissance man.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.755
Artisan, scholar.

34:23.790 --> 34:25.791
How do you figure
a guy who wrote,

34:25.824 --> 34:28.193
"All men are created equal"

34:28.228 --> 34:31.130
justified owning slaves?

34:31.164 --> 34:32.563
That's actually
a good question.

34:32.599 --> 34:35.167
I can say with some certainty

34:35.201 --> 34:37.536
that he recognized
the severe immorality of it.

34:37.570 --> 34:39.571
He supported
abolition in Virginia.

34:39.606 --> 34:42.007
Perhaps his firsthand experience
added to his eloquence

34:42.041 --> 34:44.109
in drafting a document used
to justify it.

34:44.143 --> 34:45.710
ABBIE:
Or

34:45.745 --> 34:48.380
maybe Sally Hemings
inspired him.

34:50.750 --> 34:52.818
Who is Miss Hemings?

34:52.851 --> 34:54.585
Hogwash!

34:54.621 --> 34:56.255
Thomas was a loyal husband.

34:56.289 --> 34:58.824
Your press knows no bounds!

34:58.858 --> 35:01.860
They still favor
salacious speculation to fact.

35:01.895 --> 35:03.028
I once said to Thomas,

35:03.062 --> 35:04.763
"A man who reads nothing at all

35:04.798 --> 35:06.198
"is better educated than a man

35:06.232 --> 35:07.833
who reads nothing
but newspapers."

35:07.867 --> 35:10.669
We had a good laugh
about that one.

35:14.073 --> 35:16.074
I hate to burst your bubble,

35:16.109 --> 35:18.544
but we have something called
DNA evidence,

35:18.578 --> 35:22.681
which scientifically proves
that your pal Thomas Jefferson

35:22.715 --> 35:26.285
fathered six kids by one
of his slaves-- Sally Hemings.

35:26.319 --> 35:29.354
ABBIE: And not to kick
you while you're down,

35:29.389 --> 35:33.225
but... Jefferson took credit
for your line about the press.

35:35.094 --> 35:37.296
Well...

35:37.330 --> 35:41.733
we never really know people,
do we?

35:41.768 --> 35:44.503
Should be ten minutes
or so till sundown.

35:44.537 --> 35:46.939
The seventh time
you've checked.

35:48.975 --> 35:50.776
I suspect you're also
awaiting news from Luke.

35:52.979 --> 35:55.514
Oh, it's probably for the best.

35:57.150 --> 35:59.218
Not like
we could've had a real...

35:59.252 --> 36:01.119
real friendship or anything.

36:02.655 --> 36:05.224
And why is that?

36:10.864 --> 36:12.931
It's always gonna be this.

36:12.966 --> 36:15.400
Canceling last minute,
lying about it,

36:15.435 --> 36:17.002
keeping secrets.

36:17.036 --> 36:18.537
The most important parts
of my life,

36:18.571 --> 36:20.072
the parts
that I want to share--

36:20.106 --> 36:22.641
they're off limits.

36:22.675 --> 36:24.643
So what's the point?

36:25.979 --> 36:27.312
Why are you smiling?

36:29.349 --> 36:32.551
Katrina once expressed
a similar view.

36:32.585 --> 36:35.187
She believed a liaison with me

36:35.221 --> 36:37.356
would compromise our roles
in the war.

36:38.358 --> 36:40.392
I suppose she wasn't wrong.

36:41.394 --> 36:42.961
If you hadn't been in love,

36:42.996 --> 36:44.963
she would've let you die
with the Horseman.

36:44.998 --> 36:46.965
Most likely.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.500
She wouldn't be in Purgatory.

36:48.535 --> 36:50.402
Also true.
And you wouldn't be here.

36:50.436 --> 36:51.937
Stuck in the modern era,

36:51.971 --> 36:55.541
where everyone I care about
has been dead for 200 years.

36:55.575 --> 36:57.209
That must be hard.

36:57.243 --> 36:59.278
It's an adjustment.

37:03.349 --> 37:05.784
If it makes you feel
any better,

37:05.818 --> 37:09.688
I feel pretty alone
sometimes, too.

37:09.722 --> 37:14.226
Perhaps this is the sacrifice
that witnesses must carry.

37:15.728 --> 37:17.696
All we really get...

37:17.730 --> 37:20.032
is one another.

37:25.605 --> 37:27.606
(laughs)

37:30.426 --> 37:32.393
Sun's almost down.

37:32.428 --> 37:34.896
The Horseman's going to ride.

37:34.930 --> 37:37.565
It's time.

37:47.407 --> 37:49.608
(thunder crackling)

37:51.478 --> 37:54.280
CRANE:
I received your message.

37:55.390 --> 37:57.149
My reply.

37:57.184 --> 38:00.019
(horse neighing)

38:04.858 --> 38:06.325
(thunder crackling)

38:14.534 --> 38:16.235
(gunshot)

38:24.911 --> 38:27.179
(neighing)

38:30.450 --> 38:32.518
(neighing)

38:35.589 --> 38:37.590
(thunderclaps)

38:46.133 --> 38:47.500
(panting)

38:49.603 --> 38:50.536
(grunts)

38:50.570 --> 38:53.939
Oh, that was... terrifying.

39:19.299 --> 39:21.367
(cackling)

39:39.986 --> 39:42.721
ABBIE:
Hey.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.256
Do you want to talk about it?

39:44.291 --> 39:46.725
Feeling mocked yet?

39:49.596 --> 39:50.896
(gasps)

39:52.032 --> 39:53.766
Snuff the light!

40:12.219 --> 40:15.287
ABBIE:
Crane, I'm hurt.

40:15.322 --> 40:18.357
I think I broke my ankle.

40:18.391 --> 40:20.392
(groaning)

40:23.830 --> 40:26.031
Crane, help me.

40:26.066 --> 40:28.167
Keep quiet.
I'm coming for you.

40:28.201 --> 40:30.336
Crane?!

40:32.172 --> 40:33.839
(Abbie gasps)

40:33.874 --> 40:35.808
Crane, he's here! (gasping)

40:36.909 --> 40:37.976
Now!

40:38.010 --> 40:40.879
(clacking)

40:42.850 --> 40:44.472
(gasping)

40:57.863 --> 41:08.763
