00:00.138 --> 00:01.306
Previously on Sanctuary...

00:01.366 --> 00:02.365
Stay where you are.

00:04.616 --> 00:06.549
Mommy!

00:06.550 --> 00:08.150
She was
an extraordinarily brave woman.

00:08.151 --> 00:10.553
She died protecting you
from that creature.

00:12.902 --> 00:14.409
Father hardly around.

00:14.411 --> 00:16.372
Never had much in common
with his egghead son anyway.

00:16.373 --> 00:17.908
Then his indictment

00:17.910 --> 00:18.816
just as you were
starting to fit in

00:18.818 --> 00:20.220
at the Bureau.

00:20.222 --> 00:21.884
Boy, that must have been
tough on you, huh?

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074
Learn the unknown English words

00:48.814 --> 00:50.850
I land at the airport,
everything's fine.

00:50.852 --> 00:52.318
By the time
I get into town...

00:52.320 --> 00:55.087
A mass protest
over the upcoming election.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.292
It's happening
all over the city.

00:57.294 --> 00:58.292
It could last for days.

00:58.294 --> 00:59.293
It's gonna make it hard

00:59.295 --> 01:00.963
to keep
your Sanctuary running.

01:00.965 --> 01:03.365
When I had the support
of the government,

01:03.367 --> 01:04.702
it was much easier.

01:04.703 --> 01:05.569
However, now...

01:05.571 --> 01:06.569
I know.

01:06.571 --> 01:07.971
Since Magnus
went independent,

01:07.973 --> 01:09.639
we have to do things
differently.

01:09.641 --> 01:11.874
Instead of working with
politicians and police,

01:11.876 --> 01:13.475
I'm now dealing with
thugs and warlords

01:13.477 --> 01:14.542
just to stay afloat.

01:14.544 --> 01:15.943
Which is why
I'm here in person.

01:15.945 --> 01:17.311
I'm going to
make a withdrawal

01:17.313 --> 01:18.947
from one of our private
bank accounts for you.

01:23.722 --> 01:24.988
Problem?

01:24.990 --> 01:27.426
No, it's nothing.

01:27.428 --> 01:29.395
So I'll meet you later
this afternoon with the cash.

01:29.397 --> 01:30.296
Cash?

01:30.298 --> 01:31.664
It's untraceable.

01:31.666 --> 01:32.966
It's how we roll now.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.034
How much?

01:34.036 --> 01:36.371
Enough so that
a few well-placed bribes

01:36.373 --> 01:39.342
will keep you in league
with the new government.

01:39.344 --> 01:42.813
This is a very unsettling
way of doing business.

01:42.815 --> 01:44.549
It's a brave new world.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.060
What's wrong with it?

01:54.062 --> 01:55.094
Gift card?

01:55.096 --> 01:56.496
It's just
a little impersonal.

01:56.498 --> 01:57.731
He can get
whatever he wants.

01:57.733 --> 01:58.699
I'm just sayin'.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.534
Well, what did
you get him?

01:59.536 --> 02:00.635
Deep tissue massage.

02:00.637 --> 02:01.602
What?

02:01.604 --> 02:02.670
You know that
three-toed hemasloth

02:02.672 --> 02:03.738
we just got in
from Thailand?

02:03.740 --> 02:05.641
Ah, so you didn't
<i>buy</i> him anything?

02:05.643 --> 02:07.376
It's not about
how much money you spend.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.544
No, it's the thought
that counts.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.045
Exactly.

02:10.048 --> 02:11.514
Cheapskate.

02:12.884 --> 02:13.983
What are you two
arguing about?

02:13.985 --> 02:14.851
We're not arguing.

02:14.853 --> 02:16.486
Will's birthday present.

02:16.488 --> 02:17.787
Will doesn't come back
until tomorrow.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.255
You've still got
plenty of time to shop.

02:19.257 --> 02:20.089
Huh?

02:20.091 --> 02:20.990
I am not cheap--

02:22.961 --> 02:24.361
Perimeter alarm.

02:24.363 --> 02:25.762
Someone's trying
to break in.

02:25.764 --> 02:27.630
Rooftop sensors.

02:27.632 --> 02:28.564
Someone's coming in
for a landing.

02:28.566 --> 02:29.599
A chopper?

02:29.601 --> 02:31.767
Could be
a SCIU attack.

02:31.769 --> 02:33.569
Bloody hell.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.787
Hiya, Doc.

02:49.789 --> 02:52.490
Bruno Delacourt.
I should've known.

02:52.492 --> 02:54.659
Lookin' good.

You know, that color

03:11.144 --> 03:12.510
Hey, Casanova!

03:12.512 --> 03:13.611
Stow the sweet talk
and gimme a hand?

03:13.613 --> 03:15.913
Just being polite, sweetie.

03:15.915 --> 03:16.880
Excuse me.

03:16.882 --> 03:17.715
Never heard of etiquette?

03:17.717 --> 03:18.716
That's a three syllable word.

03:18.718 --> 03:19.817
Careful you don't hurt yourself.

03:19.819 --> 03:20.685
Sheila,

03:20.687 --> 03:22.621
if you don't mind...

03:22.623 --> 03:23.889
Back to my original question?

03:23.891 --> 03:24.990
Yeah, right.

03:24.992 --> 03:26.826
My apologies for
our unannounced arrival.

03:26.828 --> 03:28.661
You almost got
yourselves shot.

03:28.663 --> 03:29.795
I told him
we should've called.

03:29.797 --> 03:30.763
Well, there wasn't
enough time.

03:30.765 --> 03:32.032
Etiquette,
he says...

03:32.034 --> 03:33.433
I'm
doing this for you!

03:33.435 --> 03:35.568
The little woman's
got a busted flapper.

03:35.570 --> 03:36.570
You may have noticed
my landing.

03:36.572 --> 03:37.838
Ugly.

03:37.840 --> 03:38.972
My left wing.

03:38.974 --> 03:40.007
Gives me too much yaw
in my pitch.

03:40.009 --> 03:42.610
There might be
some tendon damage.

03:42.612 --> 03:43.544
High tension wire.

03:43.546 --> 03:44.612
Thanks to you.

03:44.614 --> 03:46.013
I told you
"turn left!"

03:46.015 --> 03:47.582
But you always get
your directions reversed.

03:47.584 --> 03:48.817
Well, this time
I didn't.

03:48.819 --> 03:49.784
Picked a fine
time to get it right!

03:49.786 --> 03:50.752
Oh, dear God...

03:50.754 --> 03:52.053
Listen, cupcake,

03:52.055 --> 03:53.221
don't project
your anger on me--

03:53.223 --> 03:54.022
How about
I get you both inside?

03:54.024 --> 03:55.991
Thanks, Doc.

03:55.993 --> 03:57.392
We-we went over this
last session.

03:57.394 --> 03:58.961
It's all about the anger
that's projected--

03:58.963 --> 04:00.529
her inner anger--

04:00.531 --> 04:01.831
projected onto me.

04:01.833 --> 04:03.666
I didn't understand it
at the time, but...

04:03.668 --> 04:06.469
Now I have
a better grasp--

04:06.471 --> 04:08.905
And you wonder why
I'm still single.

04:12.877 --> 04:15.211
I don't see
an actual tear.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.880
Aces, honey.
You hear that?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.014
So why does it hurt?

04:18.016 --> 04:19.182
Well, there are
some lacerations

04:19.184 --> 04:21.151
on your upper primaries,

04:21.153 --> 04:24.087
but nothing seems to have
penetrated the speculum.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.856
You say a high tension wire
did this?

04:25.858 --> 04:26.857
Yeah.

04:26.859 --> 04:27.924
Yeah.

04:27.926 --> 04:29.593
Odd.

04:29.595 --> 04:30.860
With that sort of impact,

04:30.862 --> 04:32.529
I would expect to see
some ragged tearing,

04:32.531 --> 04:34.964
but these cuts look
very precise.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.199
Hmm, yeah, odd.

04:36.201 --> 04:38.701
As if they were done
with a sharp object

04:38.703 --> 04:39.836
like a blade.

04:39.838 --> 04:40.671
Go figure.

04:40.673 --> 04:41.505
I told you--

04:41.507 --> 04:42.506
Hush, my little
love pump.

04:42.508 --> 04:44.174
You know, she's still
very traumatized.

04:44.176 --> 04:45.175
C-could you...

04:45.177 --> 04:46.743
Could you give us a moment?

04:46.745 --> 04:47.578
Gladly.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.046
I'll come back to check on you,

04:49.048 --> 04:50.581
but you're
going to be fine.

04:56.855 --> 04:59.657
Ah...

04:59.659 --> 05:00.725
So this is where
you're hiding.

05:00.727 --> 05:01.559
What?

05:01.561 --> 05:02.927
I'm not hiding.

05:02.929 --> 05:04.529
Ha ha, right.

05:04.531 --> 05:06.932
Okay, I'm hiding
a little bit.

05:06.934 --> 05:08.300
But you gotta admit,

05:08.302 --> 05:09.568
those two
are toxic twins.

05:09.570 --> 05:10.936
Yeah,
they are a handful.

05:10.938 --> 05:12.038
How's Sheila doin'?

05:12.040 --> 05:13.272
Oh, she'll be fine.

05:13.274 --> 05:14.107
But?

05:15.242 --> 05:17.210
It's just that
the forensic evidence

05:17.212 --> 05:19.679
doesn't match their story
of the physical trauma.

05:19.681 --> 05:21.081
You think they're lying?

05:21.083 --> 05:22.950
Or at least faked the injury.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.052
Why?

05:26.789 --> 05:27.755
Attempted breach.

05:27.757 --> 05:28.589
Roof?

05:28.591 --> 05:29.857
Armory.

05:36.063 --> 05:37.263
Ah, makes sense.

05:37.265 --> 05:38.231
Henry...

05:41.602 --> 05:44.069
I say,
get me the hell out of here!

05:54.913 --> 05:56.814
Somebody's
just a little paranoid?

05:58.249 --> 05:59.516
I hear your anger,

05:59.518 --> 06:01.818
I acknowledge
your point of view,

06:01.820 --> 06:04.254
and I want to address
your concerns.

06:04.256 --> 06:06.624
Bruno, I'm not
the police.

06:06.626 --> 06:09.292
Whatever penny-ante scam
you're running in Old City

06:09.294 --> 06:10.627
is none of my concern,

06:10.629 --> 06:11.928
just so long as
no one gets hurt.

06:11.930 --> 06:13.230
Please, Doc, come on--

06:13.232 --> 06:16.834
But when you're under my roof,
you play by my rules.

06:16.836 --> 06:19.270
Okay... I'll admit

06:19.272 --> 06:21.038
we've been a little
less than straight with you.

06:21.040 --> 06:23.641
What were you try to steal
from the armory?

06:25.811 --> 06:27.279
There's this shipment
of Red List Abnormals

06:27.281 --> 06:28.246
on its way into town.

06:28.248 --> 06:30.149
Clearly headed for
the black market.

06:30.151 --> 06:31.450
Clearly.

06:31.452 --> 06:32.685
Clearly,
I couldn't let that happen.

06:32.687 --> 06:34.287
Not so clear.

06:34.289 --> 06:36.189
Okay, well, see,

06:36.191 --> 06:37.790
Sheila and me, we had a plan.

06:37.792 --> 06:39.058
We were gonna scam our way
into the Sanctuary,

06:39.060 --> 06:41.093
grab a few stunners,

06:41.095 --> 06:42.628
and then head out
to the drop spot--

06:42.630 --> 06:44.029
and do what...

06:44.031 --> 06:46.632
Take down the smugglers
and secure the abnormals?

06:46.634 --> 06:48.200
Way ahead of me, as usual.

06:48.202 --> 06:49.368
Please.

06:49.370 --> 06:50.970
What's in it for you?

06:50.972 --> 06:53.806
Okay, that is
exactly the reason

06:53.808 --> 06:55.307
why I didn't
come to you directly.

06:55.309 --> 06:56.408
You don't believe me.

06:56.410 --> 06:57.644
Can you blame me?

06:57.646 --> 06:59.879
You know
what I'm gonna do?

06:59.881 --> 07:01.781
You're so positive
that I'm scamming?

07:01.783 --> 07:03.717
Go ahead, call my bluff.

07:03.719 --> 07:05.986
I'm not too proud to admit
I could use a little help.

07:05.988 --> 07:08.189
So you and I--

07:08.191 --> 07:10.425
Join forces, yes.

07:11.661 --> 07:12.761
Come on, with my intel

07:12.763 --> 07:14.129
and your experience?

07:14.131 --> 07:16.732
Love it.

07:16.734 --> 07:18.301
You're gonna love--

07:18.303 --> 07:19.568
love it.
You're gonna love that?

07:19.570 --> 07:20.436
Come on.

07:20.438 --> 07:21.403
You'll love it--

07:21.405 --> 07:24.206
<i>if</i> these Red Listers do exist,

07:24.208 --> 07:26.308
my priority is to make sure

07:26.310 --> 07:27.843
they don't fall into
the wrong hands.

07:27.845 --> 07:29.845
Obviously, sure.

07:29.847 --> 07:31.980
And I'll be keeping
a very tight leash on you.

07:31.982 --> 07:33.115
Meow...

07:38.822 --> 07:40.355
It's healing nicely.

07:40.357 --> 07:44.725
You know, Cecile's been
asking about you again.

07:44.727 --> 07:45.926
Uh-huh.

07:45.928 --> 07:48.729
So is it too much effort
to pick up the phone?

07:48.731 --> 07:51.097
Magnus says you
should take it easy

07:51.099 --> 07:52.198
for a few days.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.233
Ah, so you just

07:53.235 --> 07:55.001
waltz into Old City,
break a few hearts,

07:55.003 --> 07:56.168
and then you're gone?

07:56.170 --> 07:57.203
No...

07:57.205 --> 07:58.371
What, you think

07:58.373 --> 07:59.205
you're too good for
a Ferrolump, is that it?

07:59.207 --> 08:00.273
Hey--

08:00.275 --> 08:01.607
thank goodness
you got here.

08:01.609 --> 08:03.042
Sh-shooting pain!

08:03.044 --> 08:03.943
Huh? Oh.

08:03.945 --> 08:05.878
Sorry.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.346
Magnus wants to see us.

08:07.348 --> 08:08.214
Good. Later.

08:08.216 --> 08:09.048
All of us.

08:09.050 --> 08:09.882
Huh?

08:12.886 --> 08:14.988
She still keeps
a lock of your fur.

08:43.952 --> 08:45.452
You need a hand?

09:12.203 --> 09:13.470
Will!

09:14.606 --> 09:17.340
W-w-what did they take?

09:17.342 --> 09:18.408
Everything.

09:22.147 --> 09:24.681
Oh, you've got
a nasty gash there.

09:24.683 --> 09:27.084
No... I-I can't...

09:27.086 --> 09:29.186
What is it?

09:29.188 --> 09:32.123
I can't see.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.557
Get me back to the Sanctuary.

09:33.559 --> 09:36.660
The militia have blocked off
the main roads.

09:36.662 --> 09:38.195
We need to get off the streets.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.768
Okay, this way...
This way.

09:45.770 --> 09:47.403
There's a bed
at your foot here.

09:47.405 --> 09:49.239
Lie down.

09:49.241 --> 09:51.140
Easy, easy, easy.

09:51.142 --> 09:52.708
This place
belongs to my cousin.

09:52.710 --> 09:54.510
You'll be safe here.

09:54.512 --> 09:58.147
Look up at the ceiling.

09:58.149 --> 09:59.815
What are you doing?

09:59.817 --> 10:01.117
When I was in the army,

10:01.119 --> 10:02.384
I had a friend who suffered
a similar blow.

10:02.386 --> 10:05.654
Similar symptoms,
I think maybe.

10:05.656 --> 10:06.588
Concussion?

10:06.590 --> 10:08.490
Detached retinas.

10:08.492 --> 10:10.425
You have to lay
absolutely still,

10:10.427 --> 10:11.526
on your back,

10:11.528 --> 10:13.361
and try not to move.

10:14.564 --> 10:16.632
Permanent blindness.

10:16.634 --> 10:17.466
There's a thought...

10:21.740 --> 10:24.074
I cannot stay with you.

10:24.076 --> 10:25.642
Your family, I know.

10:27.345 --> 10:28.679
I'll be fine.

10:32.685 --> 10:34.819
Go.

10:34.821 --> 10:38.423
I'll be back with help
as soon as I can.

10:52.438 --> 10:54.706
Comsets on channel one,

10:54.708 --> 10:56.440
and no idle chit-chat.

10:56.442 --> 10:57.708
What's going on?

10:57.710 --> 10:59.009
You know, Bruno,

10:59.011 --> 11:00.777
it would help if we knew
exactly where we were going.

11:00.779 --> 11:02.611
Yes, you will know
when we get there.

11:02.613 --> 11:04.346
It's not how I usually operate.

11:04.348 --> 11:06.582
Living on the edge.
My kinda gal.

11:06.584 --> 11:07.449
Are you
flirting again?

11:07.451 --> 11:10.318
Babylicious, never.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.153
All right, before I choke
on my own bile...

11:12.155 --> 11:13.121
These are fully charged.

11:13.123 --> 11:13.955
Perfect. Where's my stunner?

11:13.957 --> 11:15.223
Mine too.

11:15.225 --> 11:17.259
Not even going to have
that conversation.

11:17.261 --> 11:18.727
Wait a minute,

11:18.729 --> 11:19.895
you don't expect us
to go unarmed, do you?

11:19.897 --> 11:21.163
As far as I'm concerned,

11:21.165 --> 11:22.899
the two of you
are back-seat drivers.

11:22.901 --> 11:25.535
You get us there,
we'll do the rest.

11:26.637 --> 11:30.172
Um, Doc,
can we have a word?

11:30.174 --> 11:32.441
You know we got your back,
always,

11:32.443 --> 11:33.743
but tag-teaming
with Heckle and Jeckle?

11:33.745 --> 11:35.311
You don't actually trust them?

11:35.313 --> 11:37.447
Of course I don't,
but we need their information,

11:37.449 --> 11:40.751
however dubious
the source may be.

11:40.753 --> 11:41.886
Okay, chop chop!

11:41.888 --> 11:44.255
Let's get this party
started, huh?

11:44.257 --> 11:45.690
Sibilance...

11:45.692 --> 11:46.858
Is your-- are you getting
anything on yours?

11:46.860 --> 11:49.728
Just stay alert.

11:51.864 --> 11:54.299
I found a first aid kit
in an army truck.

11:54.301 --> 11:55.733
It's not much,

11:55.735 --> 11:58.469
but until I can
bring back a doctor...

11:58.471 --> 12:00.537
Or a wagon-load
of Tylenol.

12:06.410 --> 12:08.511
Here. Morphine.

12:08.513 --> 12:10.313
Each pump
is point three milligrams.

12:10.315 --> 12:11.648
Can you self medicate?

12:11.650 --> 12:12.749
How do you think
I got through college?

12:14.885 --> 12:16.353
It's good you have
a sense of humor.

12:17.589 --> 12:19.556
I'm here all week.
Tip your waitress.

12:20.759 --> 12:23.227
I'll be back as soon as I can.

12:23.229 --> 12:25.463
But remember, don't move.

12:49.790 --> 12:52.759
You know, it doesn't
feel like a year.

12:52.761 --> 12:54.394
It feels longer.

12:54.396 --> 12:57.497
I know, Will.

12:57.499 --> 13:00.901
She'd be
very proud of you.

13:02.671 --> 13:04.038
Come on,
it's time to go.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.006
Already?

13:05.008 --> 13:07.542
Daddy has to catch
a flight, remember?

13:07.544 --> 13:10.512
I have that big business
meeting in Houston.

13:10.514 --> 13:13.314
That's in Texas.

13:13.316 --> 13:15.083
I can name all 50 states.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.250
That's good.

13:16.252 --> 13:18.285
Come on, Nanna is
waiting for you, all right?

13:18.287 --> 13:19.720
She made you
that special cake.

13:19.722 --> 13:20.888
Let's go.

13:20.890 --> 13:23.491
Can I have a minute?

13:27.596 --> 13:28.696
I'll be in the car.

13:58.695 --> 13:59.962
Douse the lights.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.464
Bah-dah-bing.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.698
Just like I promised.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.433
Yeah.

14:04.435 --> 14:05.735
Let's not
count our abnormals

14:05.737 --> 14:06.702
before they hatch.

14:06.704 --> 14:08.504
Right, you two stay here.

14:08.506 --> 14:10.039
Whoa, whoa, wait,
you're making a mistake.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.375
I'll live with it.

14:18.516 --> 14:20.683
All right, fan left.

14:26.557 --> 14:27.390
Anything?

14:27.392 --> 14:28.591
Nada.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.400
Shouldn't you
go and help?

14:38.402 --> 14:39.367
Shh, be still,
honey lips.

14:39.369 --> 14:40.535
Let the professionals
handle it.

14:44.339 --> 14:45.105
Henry!

15:04.561 --> 15:06.496
Well done, Henry.

15:06.498 --> 15:08.498
Back atcha.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.968
I think we'd better,
you know--

15:27.719 --> 15:28.818
:Whoa.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.786
It is a Red List shipment.

15:37.928 --> 15:40.663
Stolen from Colombia,
by the looks of it.

15:40.665 --> 15:42.131
Henry, we need to get
this container

15:42.133 --> 15:44.500
back to the Sanctuary.

15:49.405 --> 15:50.606
Bruno!

15:50.608 --> 15:53.075
You! Look at your...

15:53.077 --> 15:55.043
The way the streetlight,
the lamp--

15:55.045 --> 15:56.712
Don't...speak.

15:56.714 --> 15:57.780
It's beautiful?

15:57.782 --> 15:59.648
Just hand it over.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.003
What?

16:21.005 --> 16:23.906
Diamonds <i> and</i> abnormals?

16:23.908 --> 16:26.975
What an amazing
coincidence.

16:32.287 --> 16:33.688
You lied to me.

16:33.690 --> 16:34.889
I promised you
Red Listers.

16:34.891 --> 16:36.424
You got Red Listers.

16:36.426 --> 16:37.291
Yeah, you failed
to mention

16:37.293 --> 16:39.360
a small fortune
in diamonds.

16:39.362 --> 16:40.594
Details.

16:40.596 --> 16:41.795
That's a nice haul, dude.

16:41.797 --> 16:43.831
You're really moving up
in the criminal world.

16:43.833 --> 16:44.966
The diamonds aren't for us.

16:44.968 --> 16:46.767
Let me explain this,
cuddle cakes--

16:46.769 --> 16:47.968
Yeah, 'cause you're doing
such a great job already.

16:47.970 --> 16:48.836
Really?

16:48.838 --> 16:50.704
The diamonds!

16:50.706 --> 16:53.074
We need them

16:53.076 --> 16:54.909
to buy weapons.

16:56.411 --> 16:57.545
Can you not see

16:57.547 --> 16:59.413
how this is going
in the wrong direction?

16:59.415 --> 17:00.748
Let me explain.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.983
No, no, no, no,
let <i> me</i> explain--

17:01.985 --> 17:03.617
Someone please explain.

17:03.619 --> 17:04.685
What are you doing
with the weapons?

17:04.686 --> 17:05.819
They're not for us.

17:05.821 --> 17:06.686
Perish the thought.

17:06.689 --> 17:07.821
No, they're for

17:07.824 --> 17:08.888
the international arms dealer.

17:08.891 --> 17:10.358
Yeah.

17:10.359 --> 17:11.659
Yeah, you see,

17:11.661 --> 17:13.327
we sell the weapons,
make a hefty profit,

17:13.329 --> 17:14.962
which we need.

17:14.964 --> 17:15.996
Do you?

17:15.998 --> 17:17.897
Of course we do.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.733
For the orphans.

17:21.670 --> 17:22.803
Orphans?

17:25.874 --> 17:27.909
You're giving weapons
to orphans?

17:27.911 --> 17:29.543
Okay, now, that's crazy.

17:29.545 --> 17:30.778
Okay,
follow me here.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.379
We need the diamonds
to buy the guns.

17:32.381 --> 17:34.682
We then sell the guns,
double our profit.

17:34.684 --> 17:37.351
And we use that money
to pay the black marketeers.

17:37.353 --> 17:40.354
And save the orphans
from being sold into slavery.

17:40.356 --> 17:41.588
Ta dah!

17:41.590 --> 17:43.858
Cue the violins.

17:47.429 --> 17:48.429
I got nothing.

17:50.666 --> 17:53.401
It's stunning.

17:54.503 --> 17:55.970
So, what
do you say, Doc?

17:55.972 --> 17:57.138
Hand over the ice,

17:57.140 --> 17:59.074
and it's high fives
all around, huh?

18:06.082 --> 18:07.683
It'd be so much easier
if we just killed them.

18:08.553 --> 18:09.518
Come on, this is
a travesty.

18:09.520 --> 18:10.720
We'll check out your story.

18:10.722 --> 18:11.621
Until then...

18:11.623 --> 18:12.722
Oh, come on.

18:12.724 --> 18:13.690
We don't get
a phone call, Magnus--

18:14.826 --> 18:17.627
And... peace.

18:30.806 --> 18:32.406
Holy crap.

18:33.675 --> 18:35.042
Pray tell.

18:35.044 --> 18:36.043
Well, I was pokin' around

18:36.045 --> 18:37.512
where I shouldn't be
pokin' around.

18:37.514 --> 18:38.713
Ah, good lad.

18:38.715 --> 18:39.981
NSA, Homeland Security,

18:39.983 --> 18:41.649
real backdoor
wet-job stuff here.

18:41.651 --> 18:42.917
And the bottom line is...

18:42.919 --> 18:45.654
Looks like maybe Bruno
was telling the truth,

18:45.656 --> 18:47.022
at least about the weapons.

18:47.024 --> 18:48.190
It seems there really is
a shipment.

18:48.192 --> 18:49.824
Anti-abnormal prototypes?

18:49.826 --> 18:51.059
Specially designed by SCIU.

18:51.061 --> 18:52.627
Oh, Dear Lord.

18:52.629 --> 18:54.529
There's some really
cool stuff here,

18:54.531 --> 18:55.763
except for the fact

18:55.765 --> 18:56.931
that it's designed
to kill abnormals.

18:56.933 --> 18:59.601
Then we better
intercept that shipment.

19:01.471 --> 19:03.139
Define "we"?

19:13.685 --> 19:15.118
Tasting a little crow?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.520
Don't push your luck.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.022
So we'll get the weapons?

19:18.024 --> 19:19.089
I'll get the weapons.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.791
You'll stay here.

19:23.695 --> 19:24.528
What?

19:24.530 --> 19:25.963
That's not gonna fly.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.064
Pardon the pun.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.599
Technically,
that's not a pun.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.234
Throwing your correspondence
school diploma in my face again?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.202
What is it,
onomatopoeia?

19:31.204 --> 19:32.036
Not a pun.

19:32.038 --> 19:34.872
I'll get the weapon prototypes,

19:34.874 --> 19:36.240
but not for profit,

19:36.242 --> 19:37.675
just to keep them out of
the government's hands.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.076
But I already made the deal.

19:39.078 --> 19:40.812
The seller's expecting
to see us.

19:40.814 --> 19:42.213
He sees you,
he's going to smell a rat.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.314
No offense.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.124
Will...

19:53.126 --> 19:56.094
Your dinner
is getting cold.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.870
Will...

20:04.872 --> 20:06.705
I'm not hungry.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.874
I said
I was sorry.

20:08.876 --> 20:10.275
The team's
in the finals.

20:10.277 --> 20:11.209
It's going to be
the last game of the year.

20:11.211 --> 20:12.177
So I promise,

20:12.179 --> 20:13.812
I'll get you tickets
for next year.

20:13.814 --> 20:16.048
Box seats
for both of us.

20:16.050 --> 20:17.649
It's just right now,

20:17.651 --> 20:19.217
we're just going through
a tough time, that's all.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.119
What happened to
all mom's insurance money?

20:22.255 --> 20:23.520
We're going through
a rough spot.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.554
Business has not
been great.

20:26.891 --> 20:30.026
Scott says he saw you
at his house last night.

20:30.028 --> 20:31.861
I had to talk to his
father about something.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.195
He saw you playing cards

20:33.197 --> 20:34.897
with his dad
and a couple other guys.

20:34.899 --> 20:36.198
You said you'd stop.

20:36.200 --> 20:38.834
It was just a friendly
neighborhood game,

20:38.836 --> 20:40.536
and don't you quiz me
like this, Will.

20:46.143 --> 20:48.878
Look, Will...

20:48.880 --> 20:52.148
I know you miss your mother,
especially today.

20:52.150 --> 20:52.982
Believe me,

20:52.984 --> 20:55.719
I miss her, too.

20:55.721 --> 20:57.554
It doesn't matter.
Just forget it.

20:57.556 --> 20:58.989
It's just some nights

20:58.991 --> 21:01.124
I need to blow off
a little steam.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.562
I mean, it isn't
easy without...

21:10.869 --> 21:13.236
When you get older,
you'll understand.

21:13.238 --> 21:15.139
It's okay.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.674
I'll get another birthday
next year.

21:21.313 --> 21:22.312
Come eat.

21:41.231 --> 21:42.631
I don't
like this.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.833
You trust them
with those diamonds?

21:44.835 --> 21:46.368
Just be ready to move.

21:48.305 --> 21:50.840
Hey, is that him?

21:50.842 --> 21:52.141
Of course it's him.

21:52.143 --> 21:53.309
Well, you should
go talk to him.

21:53.311 --> 21:56.045
Will you stop
micro-managing me?

21:56.047 --> 21:57.212
Seriously?

21:57.214 --> 21:59.348
Let's go.
Come on.

21:59.350 --> 22:01.717
Stay close to me.

22:03.153 --> 22:05.620
He won't
understand...

22:05.622 --> 22:06.921
Let me do this, please!

22:08.123 --> 22:12.126
The eagle has landed!

22:12.128 --> 22:13.193
Hey, buddy?

22:13.195 --> 22:14.361
Come on...

22:14.363 --> 22:15.896
Buddy, what's--

22:17.132 --> 22:18.298
That's never good.

22:18.300 --> 22:19.166
Damn it.

22:21.970 --> 22:23.137
Go, go, go!

22:28.644 --> 22:29.844
Go! Go!

22:42.257 --> 22:44.692
Definitely government types.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.259
Looks like Bruno was set up.

22:46.261 --> 22:48.962
Speaking of which...

22:50.197 --> 22:51.097
Aw, they wouldn't.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.004
They did!

23:04.549 --> 23:06.160
I'm just saying it looks bad.

23:06.596 --> 23:08.219
The place is like a war zone.

23:08.417 --> 23:10.134
<i>Still no word from Yusuf?</i>

23:10.135 --> 23:11.668
No answer
on either of their phones.

23:11.670 --> 23:13.002
<i>If the government</i>
<i>has fallen,</i>

23:13.004 --> 23:14.271
<i>they could have</i>
<i>been detained.</i>

23:14.273 --> 23:15.839
I should have
gone with him.

23:15.841 --> 23:17.140
<i>Declan called from London.</i>

23:17.142 --> 23:19.143
Says he can put a team
on the ground in Monrovia.

23:19.145 --> 23:21.112
He's got friends in Dakaar.

23:21.114 --> 23:23.047
<i>Will may just have to</i>
<i>lay low for a while.</i>

23:23.049 --> 23:25.516
In the meantime,
stay on top of the situation.

23:25.518 --> 23:26.817
<i>Locked onto</i>
<i>al Jazeera.</i>

23:26.819 --> 23:30.187
So, how'd it go
with Ozzie and Harriet?

23:30.189 --> 23:32.622
Uh... not as well
as we'd hoped,

23:32.624 --> 23:34.057
but we're about to remedy that.

23:34.059 --> 23:34.891
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

23:34.893 --> 23:36.592
Where are you two headed now?

23:36.594 --> 23:39.528
Bird hunting.

23:45.769 --> 23:47.871
I may not be a genius, babe,

23:47.873 --> 23:50.073
but... I do have my moments.

23:50.075 --> 23:51.308
And what,

23:51.310 --> 23:53.310
and I stood nearby
and slow-clapped?

23:53.312 --> 23:55.112
Please...

23:55.114 --> 23:56.714
You were good, lambchop.

23:56.716 --> 23:59.050
No, you were good,
honeybear.

23:59.052 --> 24:00.719
You looked so handsome,

24:00.721 --> 24:02.855
flying away with
all those heavy cases.

24:02.857 --> 24:04.923
Yeah, the working out
paid off, didn't it?

24:04.925 --> 24:07.025
Oh, you look
incredible...

24:08.261 --> 24:09.760
You are <i> both</i>
<i>incredible.</i>

24:11.062 --> 24:12.029
How did you..?

24:12.031 --> 24:12.730
Did you take the stairs?

24:12.732 --> 24:13.831
Start talking.

24:13.833 --> 24:14.865
I welcomed you into my home,

24:14.867 --> 24:17.000
and you manipulated
the entire situation.

24:17.002 --> 24:18.101
Shame on both of you--

24:18.103 --> 24:19.902
Okay I can see
why you're angry,

24:19.904 --> 24:22.705
but I promise you,
this wasn't a double-cross.

24:22.707 --> 24:24.073
Really? Then what
would you call it?

24:24.075 --> 24:24.907
A mix-up?

24:24.909 --> 24:25.741
And I don't like
your tone.

24:25.743 --> 24:27.010
I got this one, love muffin.

24:27.012 --> 24:28.378
Okay, here's the thing:

24:28.380 --> 24:30.847
We needed to make sure
the weapons were secure.

24:30.849 --> 24:32.615
He was actually
very heroic.

24:32.617 --> 24:34.318
It was pure instinct,
but thank you, darling--

24:34.320 --> 24:36.787
Before I vomit?

24:36.789 --> 24:37.888
Those government agents,

24:37.890 --> 24:38.790
who are they
working for again?

24:38.792 --> 24:40.058
SCIU.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.726
Cool. Anyway,
they compromised our contact

24:41.728 --> 24:44.062
before we arrived.

24:44.064 --> 24:45.463
It was all happening
in real time.

24:45.465 --> 24:47.198
I needed to do something
to protect the mission.

24:47.200 --> 24:50.235
So you flew off and left us
to fend for ourselves.

24:50.237 --> 24:51.336
You...wanted us
to stay and help?

24:51.338 --> 24:52.303
They had guns!

24:52.305 --> 24:54.071
Yeah, no, no,

24:54.073 --> 24:55.006
we fly,
you guys kick ass.

24:55.008 --> 24:56.674
It's a law of the universe,

24:56.676 --> 24:59.110
and, hey, it all
worked out in the end.

24:59.112 --> 25:00.244
Except for the part

25:00.246 --> 25:01.612
where you stole the weapons

25:01.614 --> 25:02.680
and tried
to hide them from us.

25:05.784 --> 25:07.719
I was about to call you.

25:07.721 --> 25:09.187
My head
is about to explode.

25:09.189 --> 25:10.489
Wow.

25:10.491 --> 25:13.125
I appreciate, Doc,
how this all may look,

25:13.127 --> 25:15.761
but we were both set up.

25:37.283 --> 25:41.318
Son of a bitch...

25:51.664 --> 25:53.064
I take it
you're referring to me.

25:53.066 --> 25:55.134
Unless you meant Joyce,

25:55.136 --> 25:57.203
in which case, I agree.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.176
What's on your mind, son?

26:05.012 --> 26:07.914
I'm just grabbing
the last of my things.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.115
Books and crap.

26:09.117 --> 26:09.949
I'll leave the trophies.

26:09.951 --> 26:11.050
You can have 'em,

26:11.052 --> 26:12.751
or sell them, whatever.

26:12.753 --> 26:14.987
Okay.

26:14.989 --> 26:16.922
Is this what
your shrink called

26:16.924 --> 26:18.190
being passive aggressive?

26:18.192 --> 26:20.058
I don't see a shrink anymore.

26:20.060 --> 26:21.392
You said I didn't need it.

26:21.394 --> 26:24.228
Or wait,
you said we couldn't afford it.

26:24.230 --> 26:25.963
Okay, so that's
what this is about.

26:25.965 --> 26:27.165
Now, let's see.

26:27.167 --> 26:28.300
I pay for your tuition,

26:28.302 --> 26:29.835
I pay for your expenses.

26:29.837 --> 26:31.270
I pay for everything
you ask for--

26:31.272 --> 26:33.105
Excuse me,
I'm there on a scholarship.

26:33.107 --> 26:36.509
All right, so this isn't about
money being tight.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.945
So I think you have something
you want to say to me,

26:38.947 --> 26:40.948
so why don't you just say it?

26:50.191 --> 26:52.260
What the hell
are you doing, Dad?

26:54.796 --> 26:55.796
That is none of your business.

26:55.798 --> 26:58.199
"Private investors"?

26:58.201 --> 26:59.300
"Full collateral recourse"?

26:59.302 --> 27:00.435
This is fraud.

27:00.437 --> 27:02.403
No, that is
a business opportunity,

27:02.405 --> 27:03.438
and we need it.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.839
I don't.

27:04.841 --> 27:05.807
I don't want any part of it.

27:05.809 --> 27:06.908
Oh, but you want
summer placements

27:06.910 --> 27:09.076
at Johns Hopkins?
At Columbia?

27:09.078 --> 27:10.745
Well, where do you think
that money's going to come from?

27:10.747 --> 27:12.480
I don't know,
an honest day's work?

27:13.816 --> 27:16.284
Who the hell
do you think you are?

27:16.286 --> 27:19.054
I give you
everything I have,

27:19.056 --> 27:20.321
everything!

27:20.323 --> 27:21.923
Every opportunity,
I make it work--

27:21.925 --> 27:24.359
Yeah, you make it work
as best you can. I get it!

27:24.361 --> 27:25.393
Don't you
bring her up to me.

27:25.395 --> 27:27.495
Don't you
throw that at me.

27:27.497 --> 27:29.297
Well, what do you expect?

27:30.833 --> 27:32.801
Is this what
she wanted for us?

27:32.803 --> 27:35.337
For you?

27:35.339 --> 27:38.006
You can't even...

27:38.008 --> 27:40.075
You pay for Harvard,
but you hate me for it.

27:40.077 --> 27:42.510
I'll tell you what.

27:42.512 --> 27:44.812
From now on,
I go my own way.

27:44.814 --> 27:46.982
You're off the hook.

27:46.984 --> 27:48.450
Will, will, look, look...

27:48.452 --> 27:49.417
This could work--

27:49.419 --> 27:51.553
It doesn't work, Dad.

27:51.555 --> 27:53.488
And face it, it never did.

27:53.490 --> 27:55.791
You kept
your promise to her.

27:55.793 --> 27:57.059
You did that.

27:57.061 --> 27:58.960
The rest?

27:58.962 --> 28:00.195
I don't want it anymore.

28:23.318 --> 28:25.452
Yeah...

28:34.016 --> 28:35.182
Henry,
take the weapons.

28:35.184 --> 28:36.183
Absolutely.

28:36.185 --> 28:37.018
Wait a second--
what-- Magnus!

28:37.020 --> 28:38.319
And the diamonds.

28:38.321 --> 28:39.720
Honestly, I think
that's a bit extreme.

28:39.722 --> 28:40.988
Really?

28:40.990 --> 28:43.090
Because according to you,
we were both set up,

28:43.092 --> 28:44.425
so none of this is your fault,

28:44.427 --> 28:45.359
in which case,

28:45.361 --> 28:46.527
we should
confiscate the weapons

28:46.529 --> 28:48.829
and return the gems
to their rightful owners.

28:49.866 --> 28:50.898
What is this,

28:50.900 --> 28:52.133
a Hallmark moment?

28:52.135 --> 28:53.201
You need to see
the bigger picture here.

28:53.203 --> 28:54.302
We need this stuff!

28:54.304 --> 28:56.103
So you <i> are</i> in this
for the money.

28:56.105 --> 28:57.905
For good reason.

28:59.775 --> 29:01.242
Whoa, if you say
"orphans"...

29:01.244 --> 29:03.111
These kids need our help, yes!

29:03.113 --> 29:05.747
And you're taking food
from their little mouths!

29:05.749 --> 29:08.282
Okay, <i> that,</i>
that's a Hallmark moment.

29:08.284 --> 29:10.651
We are doing all of this
for children in need.

29:10.653 --> 29:11.685
If you think helping the needy

29:11.687 --> 29:12.953
is a worthless
venture,

29:12.955 --> 29:15.188
then go ahead,
take it, take it.

29:15.190 --> 29:16.123
Yeah, take it all.

29:16.125 --> 29:17.924
Here.
There you go.

29:19.159 --> 29:20.893
Oh, you are a nasty woman.

29:23.730 --> 29:26.164
Angry birds...

29:26.166 --> 29:28.499
There are no orphans.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.872
What choice do we have?

29:34.874 --> 29:36.908
Our trust has been betrayed
at every turn.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.111
I'm sorry,

29:40.113 --> 29:41.812
to both of you,

29:41.814 --> 29:44.148
but this is the end
of us working together.

29:44.150 --> 29:44.982
Oh, amen.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.519
I understand.

29:48.521 --> 29:51.389
I want to thank both of you
for all you've done.

29:51.391 --> 29:53.992
It didn't work out.
That's life, right?

29:53.994 --> 29:55.127
Onward.

30:01.835 --> 30:04.203
Onward.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.527
I'm not trying to sound
like a snob or anything,

30:30.529 --> 30:33.096
it's just that some
abnormals lack a certain...

30:33.098 --> 30:34.464
<i>"Class"</i> is the word.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.132
But what if they're
telling the truth?

30:36.134 --> 30:37.166
About the orphans?

30:37.168 --> 30:38.301
If they do exist,

30:38.303 --> 30:40.203
can we afford
to turn our backs?

30:40.205 --> 30:41.771
Doc, I've looked
into it, okay?

30:41.773 --> 30:44.173
There's nothing on any
boatload of missing kids.

30:44.175 --> 30:45.608
Oh, and wait,

30:45.610 --> 30:47.876
the flying Bickersons have
screwed us over twice.

30:47.878 --> 30:49.344
Think back
over recent events.

30:49.346 --> 30:51.012
Something about this
isn't right.

30:51.014 --> 30:52.947
Yeah, the fact that
they're lying thieves.

30:52.949 --> 30:54.515
Thieves, maybe.
But liars?

30:54.517 --> 30:55.850
Not deliberately.

30:55.852 --> 30:57.084
They might have
filtered the truth,

30:57.086 --> 30:58.585
or been a bit selective
with the information--

30:58.587 --> 31:00.854
Which is commonly
known as lying.

31:00.856 --> 31:02.989
The intel they supplied
is essentially correct.

31:02.991 --> 31:05.224
The Red List shipment.
The weapons buy.

31:05.226 --> 31:07.860
The stash of diamonds.
The stealing.

31:07.862 --> 31:10.263
It's an imperfect world.

31:10.265 --> 31:11.331
Being flexible
with our allies

31:11.333 --> 31:13.299
gives us more
than condemning them.

31:13.301 --> 31:16.904
The days of judging things
at face value are over.

31:18.606 --> 31:20.307
So we've gone rogue,

31:20.309 --> 31:21.608
and now we have to hang
with the deadbeats,

31:21.610 --> 31:22.843
I get that, Doc,

31:22.845 --> 31:24.478
but we don't
have to trust them.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.847
Maybe we need to stop
being so judgmental.

31:26.849 --> 31:29.049
This is that whole 113
years of Zen philosophy,

31:29.051 --> 31:29.950
isn't it?

31:29.952 --> 31:30.917
You know what I mean.

31:30.919 --> 31:31.985
I really don't,

31:31.987 --> 31:33.119
but I do know what
you're going to say.

31:33.121 --> 31:34.254
Something I need you
to check for me, Henry.

31:34.256 --> 31:35.455
Of course there is.

31:37.424 --> 31:38.257
No tears, babe.

31:41.094 --> 31:43.294
You said
we'd get the money, Bruno.

31:43.296 --> 31:44.396
You said this would work.

31:46.298 --> 31:47.965
It will,

31:47.967 --> 31:51.435
I promise.

31:51.437 --> 31:52.904
Have I ever
steered us wrong?

31:52.906 --> 31:55.339
Have I?

32:01.580 --> 32:03.214
You swear to me.

32:05.584 --> 32:08.052
I swear it's not over.

32:11.356 --> 32:14.224
Come on,

32:14.226 --> 32:16.159
a nice little workout
to clear the head?

32:16.161 --> 32:17.293
Come on, come on,

32:17.295 --> 32:20.029
you love it.
You love it.

32:21.431 --> 32:23.265
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

32:24.401 --> 32:26.101
Ha ha.

32:28.037 --> 32:29.938
Doofus.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.499
Thank you.

33:02.373 --> 33:04.040
Look at you.

33:04.042 --> 33:05.608
Hey.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.477
Come here,
come here...

33:19.224 --> 33:23.093
So y-you're done
with Quantico, I hear.

33:23.095 --> 33:26.396
I got a few weeks left.

33:26.398 --> 33:28.565
I still don't know
where my posting will be.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.666
Wow...

33:29.668 --> 33:30.701
You owe me for this.

33:30.703 --> 33:32.103
Dad--

33:32.105 --> 33:33.237
I mean, really.

33:33.239 --> 33:36.140
You wouldn't have become
a bigshot profiler

33:36.142 --> 33:37.508
unless you had me
as a dad.

33:37.510 --> 33:39.477
You practically grew up
in a criminal environment--

33:39.479 --> 33:42.080
Dad, don't do this.

33:42.082 --> 33:43.215
Don't make it harder.

33:47.087 --> 33:48.687
I spoke to
your lawyer.

33:48.689 --> 33:49.688
Yeah, I know.

33:49.690 --> 33:54.226
You better get used to
this color on me.

33:54.228 --> 33:56.562
Look, you came,

33:56.564 --> 33:57.563
we talked,

33:57.565 --> 33:58.564
and as you said,

33:58.566 --> 34:00.533
you're off the hook, will.

34:00.535 --> 34:01.334
Listen to me.

34:01.336 --> 34:03.569
I went through your file

34:03.571 --> 34:05.138
in Washington,

34:05.140 --> 34:07.540
all of it.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.342
Now, there's a clerical error
in a witness deposition

34:09.344 --> 34:10.342
prior to your arrest.

34:10.344 --> 34:11.612
It's not much,

34:11.614 --> 34:12.646
but I think I can
alter the data

34:12.648 --> 34:13.480
to make it look like--

34:13.482 --> 34:15.081
No. No, Will--
no, no, no.

34:15.083 --> 34:17.184
Your counsel thinks that
they can move for retrial,

34:17.186 --> 34:18.185
maybe even a dismissal--

34:18.187 --> 34:19.554
Will!

34:19.556 --> 34:22.556
That is not going to happen.

34:22.559 --> 34:24.592
Do you hear me?

34:24.594 --> 34:26.261
I have people
working on my case.

34:26.263 --> 34:28.530
I did not ask you for your help.

34:28.532 --> 34:29.731
You're looking at
five to seven years.

34:29.733 --> 34:32.333
Don't you dare
get yourself involved!

34:32.335 --> 34:33.768
Years, Dad!
Is that what you want?

34:33.770 --> 34:35.670
You stay out of this,
do you understand me?

34:35.672 --> 34:37.672
You stay out of this!

34:41.543 --> 34:42.510
You stubborn bastard.

34:42.512 --> 34:44.745
Wait, Will, Will, Will...

34:44.746 --> 34:46.347
Wait a minute.
Will! Will!

34:46.349 --> 34:49.150
Will, wait! Will!

34:55.424 --> 34:57.358
Yeah...

34:57.360 --> 34:59.327
Stubborn bastard.

34:59.329 --> 35:00.662
Will?

35:04.468 --> 35:06.803
How long have I been...

35:06.805 --> 35:08.905
Two days.
How do you feel?

35:10.674 --> 35:11.607
Awesome.

35:12.709 --> 35:14.777
The doctor
has come and gone.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.212
He says if they haven't
reattached by now, then--

35:17.214 --> 35:19.447
Yeah, well, I guess
we'll see, won't we?

35:19.449 --> 35:20.615
How are you,
are you okay?

35:20.617 --> 35:21.615
Fine.

35:21.617 --> 35:22.716
The fighting
has died down.

35:22.718 --> 35:24.752
I didn't mean
to leave you so long, Will.

35:24.754 --> 35:25.819
I had to make sure

35:25.821 --> 35:27.588
that my wife
and children were safe.

35:27.590 --> 35:29.357
That's okay.

35:29.359 --> 35:31.593
My sons are teenagers.

35:31.595 --> 35:34.229
Idealists.

35:34.231 --> 35:36.632
They hear the fighting,
the mobs.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.101
They want to
join the fight,

35:38.103 --> 35:39.369
pick up arms.

35:39.371 --> 35:40.370
When that happens,

35:40.372 --> 35:43.607
I'll do anything
to keep them from harm.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.510
Will?

35:54.551 --> 35:57.353
Well, I won't be
reading the newspaper

35:57.355 --> 35:58.254
anytime soon, but...

36:00.290 --> 36:02.758
Nice room.

36:02.760 --> 36:04.526
That's good news.

36:04.528 --> 36:05.561
Yusuf...

36:05.563 --> 36:07.729
Are your kids all right?

36:07.731 --> 36:09.364
With my sister in Sefula.

36:10.866 --> 36:12.701
That's good.

36:12.703 --> 36:13.802
You should rest.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.204
I have more
pain medication for you.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.539
No.

36:16.541 --> 36:19.576
Just get me a phone.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.881
Hmm...

36:25.483 --> 36:27.918
Hmm...

36:27.920 --> 36:28.820
Yup.

36:28.822 --> 36:30.188
Henry...

36:30.190 --> 36:32.190
I am collating here.

36:32.192 --> 36:34.892
Well, either do it silently
or tell me something.

36:34.894 --> 36:36.661
Wow, what happened to
the Xen patience?

36:36.663 --> 36:38.596
Found something.

36:38.598 --> 36:39.831
Interpol warrants

36:39.833 --> 36:41.766
for a Red List supplier
out of Dublin,

36:41.768 --> 36:43.268
Finn Noland.

36:43.270 --> 36:44.402
Warrants for what?

36:45.671 --> 36:48.272
"Child slave trading."

36:48.274 --> 36:49.840
Yeah, keep reading.
The encrypted data?

36:49.842 --> 36:52.510
"Abnormal
child slave trading."

36:52.512 --> 36:53.578
Dear God.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.880
Yeah, Noland is
an extremely bad dude.

36:55.882 --> 36:57.315
The rumor mill puts him
in town, tonight,

36:57.317 --> 36:58.617
with cargo,

36:58.619 --> 36:59.884
at the docks.

36:59.886 --> 37:01.185
Orphans.

37:01.187 --> 37:02.486
If Bruno and Sheila

37:02.488 --> 37:03.821
try to intercept
this shipment alone...

37:03.823 --> 37:05.722
Oh, that could go very badly.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.891
I think you owe
both of us an explanation,

37:07.893 --> 37:10.194
and an apology.

37:10.196 --> 37:11.228
The agreement
was simple.

37:11.230 --> 37:13.230
You bring me the money,

37:13.232 --> 37:14.732
I give you
the wee kiddies.

37:14.734 --> 37:16.701
No dollars for me,

37:16.703 --> 37:17.569
no merchandise.

37:17.571 --> 37:18.803
You monster!

37:20.807 --> 37:23.342
You tried
to alter the deal, didn't you?

37:23.344 --> 37:24.677
I can't have that.

37:27.381 --> 37:28.414
Kill the both of them.

37:34.654 --> 37:35.988
Wait a second,
wait a second.

37:37.209 --> 37:38.275
Here-here's the thing,

37:38.277 --> 37:40.643
we can get you
the money today.

37:40.645 --> 37:41.745
Bruno...

37:41.747 --> 37:43.847
I got this.

37:43.849 --> 37:45.315
I thought so.

37:45.317 --> 37:46.916
Yeah, okay,

37:46.918 --> 37:48.819
so, you're
a busy man, right?

37:48.821 --> 37:50.854
So let's talk
price here, huh?

37:50.856 --> 37:51.855
What do you need

37:51.857 --> 37:54.958
for me to take all these...

37:54.960 --> 37:56.126
these drooling,
screaming,

37:56.128 --> 37:59.029
annoying little kids
off your hands, huh?

37:59.031 --> 38:01.631
Street value on all of them
is five million dollars.

38:03.734 --> 38:05.167
No bulk discount?

38:06.403 --> 38:07.536
How can you
do this?

38:07.538 --> 38:09.337
I mean, just-
just look at them all!

38:09.339 --> 38:11.339
They need food, shelter, love.

38:11.341 --> 38:14.308
Who knows what they've
all been through.

38:14.310 --> 38:15.242
I do.

38:16.312 --> 38:17.411
You have just
released a tigress!

38:17.413 --> 38:18.879
You...

38:18.881 --> 38:20.114
You are going down,
you hear me?

38:20.116 --> 38:21.382
You eurotrash, central casting--

38:21.384 --> 38:22.650
You married her?

38:22.652 --> 38:23.818
--Cheap cologne-wearing
hairpiece!

38:23.820 --> 38:25.286
Yeah.

38:25.288 --> 38:26.721
Fiery passion
is so intoxicating.

38:26.723 --> 38:27.756
Flying woman,

38:27.758 --> 38:29.825
scream all you want.

38:29.827 --> 38:31.994
Those children are mine to sell.

38:31.996 --> 38:33.029
There's no one here
who can help you--

38:34.533 --> 38:35.365
Ha!

38:40.172 --> 38:42.338
Oh, get us loose,
get us down, please!

38:42.340 --> 38:43.173
It's about time.

38:43.175 --> 38:44.007
Get us down!

38:44.009 --> 38:45.841
Get us loose from here!

38:46.844 --> 38:48.077
Doc?

38:51.714 --> 38:52.948
Please, please,
Dr. Magnus...

38:52.950 --> 38:54.416
Of course.

39:04.259 --> 39:06.327
May I?

39:06.329 --> 39:09.763
Absolutely.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.433
Come on, it's okay.
You're safe now.

39:39.365 --> 39:41.065
Oh, you're all safe now.

39:42.369 --> 39:45.070
Oh, Bruno,
look at them all.

39:45.072 --> 39:47.038
They're so gorgeous.

39:47.040 --> 39:48.206
Yeah, they're beautiful.

39:48.208 --> 39:49.774
We've got a family.

39:49.776 --> 39:51.342
I need to get a job.

39:51.344 --> 39:52.744
Yes, you really do.

39:52.746 --> 39:54.279
Yeah.

39:56.048 --> 39:57.248
Dammit...

39:58.918 --> 40:00.384
Every time!

40:14.431 --> 40:16.932
Sub-retinal fluid
is coming in well.

40:16.934 --> 40:18.000
Iris looks fine.

40:18.002 --> 40:19.034
How's your head?

40:20.838 --> 40:22.038
Were you always a brunette?

40:22.040 --> 40:23.439
Not always.

40:23.441 --> 40:24.474
You, William,

40:24.476 --> 40:26.276
are fit for duty.

40:26.278 --> 40:28.845
And by that I mean
a well-deserved pint.

40:28.847 --> 40:29.946
Thank you.

40:29.948 --> 40:31.916
Dude, how you
feeling?

40:31.918 --> 40:34.051
Biggie, is that you?

40:34.053 --> 40:36.254
Hey, yeah, you're fine.

40:37.556 --> 40:39.324
All right, you guys
ready to go?

40:39.326 --> 40:41.259
I am starving.

40:41.261 --> 40:44.295
Private room at Alfredo's,
the wine is on me, cake is on her.

40:44.297 --> 40:46.130
Surprise.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.467
Surprise!

40:50.469 --> 40:51.534
Thanks a lot, guys,

40:51.536 --> 40:53.069
but, uh...

40:53.071 --> 40:54.504
I have other plans.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.540
Will?

41:03.581 --> 41:05.215
Henry?

41:05.217 --> 41:07.217
He heard about
the cake, right?

41:07.219 --> 41:08.885
Save me some.

41:15.359 --> 41:17.027
Thank you.

41:19.030 --> 41:20.831
Happy Birthday.

41:35.515 --> 41:36.515
Hey.

41:38.885 --> 41:40.619
Hey, you.

41:45.893 --> 41:47.425
Roy Halladay?

41:47.427 --> 41:48.593
Get outta here.

41:48.595 --> 41:50.227
No big deal.

41:50.229 --> 41:52.329
I know a guy in Philly.

41:52.331 --> 41:54.898
We did time together.

41:59.236 --> 42:00.537
I could murder a steak.

42:00.539 --> 42:01.538
How about you?

42:01.540 --> 42:02.907
As long as you're paying.

42:02.909 --> 42:05.042
Me?

42:05.044 --> 42:06.244
I'm the one
who got robbed in Liberia!

42:06.246 --> 42:08.380
Yeah, right.
That's cheap, kid.

42:08.382 --> 42:10.315
You're breakin' my heart.

42:15.422 --> 42:16.388
Look at you.

42:22.328 --> 42:24.095
Come here.

42:29.401 --> 42:31.268
Yeah.
