WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.700
Previously onDynasty...As an added bonus
for saving my life,

00:04.743 --> 00:08.051
a third of the shipping loot.
Five million dollars, cash.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.097
But he explained it to me.So he told you

00:10.140 --> 00:11.533
that he kept working for Ada

00:11.576 --> 00:13.578
even after he got
the blackmail back?Excuse me?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.493
This is over. The
wedding is off.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.930
I told you to never
call me again, Fallon.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.152
I'm pregnant.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.723
I was looking for...Liam?

00:27.766 --> 00:29.290
Oh, we're actually
leaving on vacation.

00:36.471 --> 00:39.039
♪ We gotta get out
of this place ♪

00:40.040 --> 00:43.652
♪ If it's the last thing
we ever do ♪

00:43.695 --> 00:46.655
♪ We gotta get out
of this place ♪

00:46.698 --> 00:50.963
♪ 'Cause, girls, there's a
better life for me and you... ♪

00:51.007 --> 00:52.965
You're gonna need
a bigger suitcase.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.100
Oh, dear.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.276
Are you still going
on your honeymoon?

00:59.320 --> 01:02.975
That's so sad.
Not that I'm judging. Outwardly.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.282
No, Mother,
side-by-side couples massages

01:05.326 --> 01:06.718
with no one by my side

01:06.762 --> 01:08.155
would only make me
more depressed,

01:08.198 --> 01:09.939
which is why
I'm taking a girls trip.

01:09.982 --> 01:12.159
I love it.
And that'll give us a chance

01:12.202 --> 01:15.075
to drill down on what went wrong
with Culhane.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.206
I can be packed

01:16.250 --> 01:17.773
in three hours.Oh.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.731
You're sweet
and slightly delusional.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.124
I said girls trip,

01:21.168 --> 01:23.300
not mom's trip. Sorry.ALEXIS:
I see.

01:23.344 --> 01:27.087
What was I thinking, trying
to ease my daughter's pain?

01:30.351 --> 01:32.004
Did I hear you say something

01:32.048 --> 01:34.006
about a girls trip?

01:34.050 --> 01:35.921
Not on purpose.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.402
But did you hear the part
where I said "no moms"?

01:38.446 --> 01:41.884
An addendum. That means no
soon-to-be stepmoms, either.

01:41.927 --> 01:43.538
Do you even know what snow is?

01:43.581 --> 01:45.148
I hear it's even whiter
than you.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.803
Look, I didn't get to be
one of your bridesmaids,

01:47.846 --> 01:49.805
and this could possibly be
the last chance I have

01:49.848 --> 01:51.459
to get away
before I catch a cold,

01:51.502 --> 01:53.591
your dad freaks out
and puts me on bed rest.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.593
You know
how overprotective he is.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.335
Okay, fine.

01:58.379 --> 02:00.032
But if I let you come,

02:00.076 --> 02:02.296
will you let me touch your hair?

02:02.339 --> 02:04.733
It's not off the table.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.563
You are making insane
progress, Jeff.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.783
If I got shot two weeks ago,
I would be on my ass, in bed,

02:11.827 --> 02:14.351
watching shows about jaguars
rolling up on alligators.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.789
Thanks.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.095
You know, as crazy
as it may sound,

02:19.139 --> 02:20.705
this whole experience
invigorated me.

02:20.749 --> 02:24.318
And I didn't tell you yet,
but Mom called me back.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.102
What?It's all good, all right?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.321
She was thrilled
to hear from me.

02:27.364 --> 02:29.932
So I'm sending my plane
to bring her home

02:29.975 --> 02:32.891
to Atlanta for a long
overdue family reunion.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.110
Have you lost your mind?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.068
How could you do
something like that

02:36.112 --> 02:37.461
without talking to me about it?

02:37.505 --> 02:40.290
She can't wait to see us, Mon.Like hell she can't.

02:40.334 --> 02:41.813
She waited nearly 12 years

02:41.857 --> 02:44.294
without reaching out
so much as once.Look, I get it.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.123
She left us to
pursue her dreams.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.907
Maybe she wasn't a
good mother back then,

02:48.951 --> 02:51.258
but that doesn't mean she
can't be a good person now.

02:51.301 --> 02:54.217
If almost dying
taught me anything,

02:54.261 --> 02:57.177
it's that life is way too
short to hold grudges.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.482
I want to know my mother.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.136
And I want you

03:00.180 --> 03:02.573
by my side when her
plane lands tomorrow.

03:02.617 --> 03:04.575
Well, what a shame.

03:04.619 --> 03:07.012
I'm leaving town with Fallon.

03:08.405 --> 03:11.408
Guess you'll have to
handle Mom on your own.Mon.

03:14.629 --> 03:17.762
Dr. Murphy is the top ob-gyn
on the East Coast.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.286
The wait to get in
is six months,

03:19.329 --> 03:21.244
but I got him to squeeze us in
tomorrow because...

03:21.288 --> 03:23.420
Well, my child waits for no one.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.596
Well, he can squeeze us in
when I get back.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.250
I don't think you
should be taking a trip

03:27.294 --> 03:28.556
when you have an appointment
tomorrow morning

03:28.599 --> 03:30.253
that cost me an arm and a leg

03:30.297 --> 03:32.037
and a golf membership at Augusta
to get.

03:32.081 --> 03:35.084
My next year is gonna be filled
with doctors appointments.

03:35.127 --> 03:37.129
We can wait a few days
for the first one.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.827
Fine.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.611
Enjoy your trip with Fallon.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.918
It'll give me some time to meet
with this budding soccer player

03:42.961 --> 03:44.485
that I've had my eye on.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.095
He's gonna help us
knock it out of the park.

03:46.138 --> 03:49.272
No. Please don't make
a baseball reference

03:49.316 --> 03:50.621
to a soccer player.

03:51.535 --> 03:55.191
We'll work on that later. Bye.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.067
FEMALE VOICE:
System disarmed.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.113
Thank you.Thank you.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.248
The break-in's my fault, Ma.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.946
I should've had this security
system put in a while ago.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.339
But I can promise you

04:12.382 --> 04:14.079
nothing like this
will ever happen again.

04:14.123 --> 04:15.951
Well, we're all fine,

04:15.994 --> 04:19.346
and everything the sons
of bitches took can be replaced.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.957
What about that black leather
bag you were looking for--

04:22.000 --> 04:23.219
did you find it?

04:23.263 --> 04:24.264
What was in it?

04:24.307 --> 04:27.832
Uh, just some cash
for a rainy day.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.312
And how long
are you gonna be staying here?

04:29.356 --> 04:30.574
It's already been a week,

04:30.618 --> 04:31.967
and I do not love
sharing a bathroom

04:32.010 --> 04:33.447
with you again.I don't know.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.187
But I'm happy to be making
up for so much time away.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.233
Mm-mmm.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.104
You haven't said one word

04:39.148 --> 04:40.584
about being dumped by Fallon.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.283
You okay?

04:44.327 --> 04:46.416
It is for the best.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.859
Anders told me you were robbed.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.296
I'm so sorry.

04:58.689 --> 05:00.996
MONICA: I know
this isn't what you planned

05:01.039 --> 05:03.346
to be doing this week
or who you planned

05:03.390 --> 05:06.349
to be spending it with,
but we are still gonna have fun.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.177
This is already fun for me.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.352
How are you doing

05:09.396 --> 05:11.311
with the Culhane of it all?Great.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.747
But this is a girls trip,

05:12.790 --> 05:15.227
so I don't want to talk
about him or any other boys.

05:15.271 --> 05:16.881
Works for me.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.753
I don't want to talk
about my family.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.276
And I don't want to talk
about being pregnant.

05:24.367 --> 05:25.977
Did someone say girls trip?

05:26.935 --> 05:29.241
Did someone say psycho stowaway?

05:29.285 --> 05:31.374
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:31.418 --> 05:32.984
In a bikini.KIRBY:
Oh, simple.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.247
I was in the kitchen when Fallon
asked someone to pack for her.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.771
I didn't have
anywhere else to be,

05:36.814 --> 05:38.381
and I figured if I asked,
you'd say no.

05:38.425 --> 05:40.383
You are correct.So,

05:40.427 --> 05:42.342
where are we going--
Tahiti, the Maldives?

05:42.385 --> 05:44.431
Somewhere slightly less warm.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.737
You're just gonna
let this happen?We're too high up now

05:46.781 --> 05:48.043
to throw her out in a parachute,

05:48.086 --> 05:49.349
and I'm not going back
to Atlanta.

05:49.392 --> 05:51.786
Sweet.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.267
I know why you're here.Look,

05:55.311 --> 05:56.356
whatever happened
between you and Fallon--

05:56.399 --> 05:57.400
that's none of my business.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.662
But launching my soccer team

05:58.706 --> 06:02.405
into a mega franchise--
that is my business.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.842
And that's where
you can help me.

06:04.886 --> 06:08.106
I know less about soccer
than you do, if that's possible.

06:08.150 --> 06:10.457
But you do know
about Sterling Wells.

06:10.500 --> 06:12.284
Sterling Wells
is the best soccer player

06:12.328 --> 06:13.547
to ever come out of Atlanta,

06:13.590 --> 06:15.331
went to my high school
ten years after me,

06:15.375 --> 06:17.420
grew up on the other side
of the park. So what?And now he plays

06:17.464 --> 06:19.074
in Belgium, but I want
to bring him back to here

06:19.117 --> 06:20.467
to be the face of my team.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.425
And what can I do?

06:22.469 --> 06:24.906
I want you to come with me.
You two speak the same language.

06:24.949 --> 06:28.126
Is that the "black" language,
Blake?

06:29.171 --> 06:30.433
No.

06:30.477 --> 06:32.740
Look, if I was trying
to hire him

06:32.783 --> 06:35.264
to strike oil for me,
I'd talk to him.

06:35.307 --> 06:38.136
You're an athlete.
Sports is your thing.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.312
Now, there may be a job for you
with the team

06:40.356 --> 06:41.662
if you help me lure him back.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.577
Well...

06:43.620 --> 06:45.927
I was gonna say I needed
some time to think about it,

06:45.970 --> 06:47.929
but I don't.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.147
Excellent.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.366
Hard pass.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.454
What?You see, where I'm at

06:51.498 --> 06:53.064
in my life,

06:53.108 --> 06:56.154
I need to distance myself
from the Carringtons.

06:56.198 --> 07:00.202
Actually, I see
exactly where you are, Michael.

07:01.682 --> 07:03.640
And I think you need the money.

07:03.684 --> 07:06.469
You know I'm right.

07:13.824 --> 07:17.219
Who leaves cold weather
to go to even colder weather?

07:17.262 --> 07:20.222
Who stows away on an airplane
with nothing but bathing suits?

07:20.265 --> 07:21.484
Who wants to get a massage?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.486
Who wants a drink?

07:23.530 --> 07:25.053
Who wants to buy pants?

07:25.096 --> 07:26.489
You may have noticed
I don't have

07:26.533 --> 07:28.578
many girlfriends in Atlanta.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.058
You mean, "any"?

07:30.101 --> 07:31.625
Which is why I wanted to come.

07:31.668 --> 07:34.323
I mean, is that such a crime?Okay, here's an idea:

07:34.366 --> 07:36.151
how about we leave
our problems at home.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.370
Girls trips are about
having fun with the girls.

07:38.414 --> 07:39.807
Exactly.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.417
KIRBY:
One more thing?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.724
That guy looks a lot like Liam.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.465
And who's that girl he's with?

07:48.555 --> 07:50.513
Girls trip?

07:50.557 --> 07:53.516
Well, it is a girls trip.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.171
In which the best girl wins.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.720
Liam's clearly here
with another woman.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.243
Now, I don't want
to be your mother, but...

08:25.287 --> 08:26.941
Then don't be my mother, okay?

08:26.984 --> 08:28.943
I mean, Alexis
isn't here for a reason.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.511
You duped us.
So not cool.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.556
And neither is competing
with another girl over a boy.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.818
You know that.

08:34.862 --> 08:37.560
Liam and I have a connection.
You've seen us.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.953
But when you meet a stranger

08:38.996 --> 08:40.302
outside city hall
on a park bench

08:40.345 --> 08:41.695
and convince him
to fake marry you

08:41.738 --> 08:43.000
to sabotage your actual fiancé,

08:43.044 --> 08:44.959
I mean, the relationship's
bound to go bust.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.265
I put Liam
through the wringer, okay?

08:47.309 --> 08:49.920
And I regret that, but I know
if I can get him alone

08:49.964 --> 08:52.444
and explain my true feelings,
I can win him back.

08:52.488 --> 08:55.970
You saw him with that woman,
right? It wasn't just me.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.972
That woman is just
a temporary rebound.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.496
A preppy little mosquito
that will go away once swatted.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.845
I have a question.

09:01.889 --> 09:04.544
Why are we inside,
yammering on

09:04.587 --> 09:06.023
when we could be outside skiing?

09:06.067 --> 09:07.547
FALLON:
Kirby, you are free

09:07.590 --> 09:09.026
to do whatever you want.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.420
I encourage you to go find
a gondola to stow away on.

09:11.463 --> 09:14.815
Come with me, Kirby.
I'll buy you some warm clothes.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.080
I'm sorry
I duped you.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.908
How mad are you at me?

09:20.951 --> 09:23.084
You, like, one cocktail mad?

09:23.127 --> 09:24.912
Two?Three.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.609
Three.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.393
Well, the first three rounds
are on me.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.439
What was I thinking?

09:30.482 --> 09:32.049
All rounds are on me.

09:34.095 --> 09:37.054
We need to talk to you.I'm a little busy trying
to secure this house.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.708
You've made this house so secure

09:38.752 --> 09:41.624
I think the Marines are gonna
roll up if I crack a window.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.974
I don't see what the problem is.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.194
Michael Laurence Culhane.That's not good.

09:46.237 --> 09:48.762
No, it is not.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.547
I may have slightly overheard
your conversation with Blake,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.723
and I don't know why on earth

09:53.767 --> 09:55.943
you declined his offer
to go to Belgium.

09:55.986 --> 09:59.468
After we just got robbed?
I can't leave you two alone.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.992
You don't want to leave us
because you got dumped by Fallon

10:02.036 --> 10:04.952
and you're too insecure
to get back into the world.Boom.

10:04.995 --> 10:07.041
LUELLA: Now, we learned how
to take care of ourselves

10:07.084 --> 10:08.172
before you left,

10:08.216 --> 10:10.566
and we'll continue
to do so without you.

10:10.610 --> 10:13.351
Now you got to take care
of yourself, baby.

10:13.395 --> 10:15.658
Think about Blake's offer.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.486
You always wanted
to work in sports,

10:17.529 --> 10:19.314
and you'd be great at it.

10:19.357 --> 10:22.099
Don't do this
because it's good for Blake.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.493
Make it good for you.:
Boom.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.327
That's not at all
noticeable, Fallon.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.895
Why don't you just
stand on a table and yell,

10:34.938 --> 10:36.723
"Has anyone seem my Liam?"

10:36.766 --> 10:38.028
You're right.
You're right.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.465
Why don't we... hit the slopes?

10:40.509 --> 10:42.685
Hmm. It's all good.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.034
I'm actually just thrilled

10:44.078 --> 10:46.689
not to be in Atlanta
when my mother returns.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.823
You know, I get the whole mother
thing, but I have to admit,

10:49.866 --> 10:52.608
having Alexis back in my life
hasn't been a total nightmare.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.045
I mean, she went to extreme
lengths to get me my dream

10:55.089 --> 10:57.265
wedding venue, and she didn't
even rub it in my face

10:57.308 --> 10:59.223
after she ran a woman
over for no reason.

10:59.267 --> 11:02.357
I mean, that's-that's...
that's sweet... ish.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.360
We have wildly different
situations, Fal.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.188
Your mother
never wanted to leave,

11:07.231 --> 11:08.798
andshe chose to come back.

11:08.842 --> 11:11.192
My selfish mother
chose to abandon us

11:11.235 --> 11:12.715
when my father went to prison,

11:12.759 --> 11:15.152
and now she's being dragged back
by my masochistic brother.

11:15.196 --> 11:18.112
Hmm. You're right.
It's totally different,

11:18.155 --> 11:20.157
and she's a terrible
person, and...

11:20.201 --> 11:22.159
Oh, my God! Is that him?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.595
That's him! That's Liam! Is it?

11:23.639 --> 11:25.946
It... No, it's not.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.600
No.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.385
Now I'm a terrible person.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.908
ALEXIS:
Let's put

11:31.952 --> 11:34.694
the spa chair right here in
the middle of the dining room.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.304
But face it into the room.

11:36.347 --> 11:39.089
Perfect. Uh,
light boxes around the chair.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.657
Plants around the light boxes.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.746
Get the plants nice and close
to the windows

11:43.790 --> 11:45.530
so that they can absorb
the sunlight.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.141
Got it? We all good?

11:47.184 --> 11:48.229
Have you seen anyone?

11:48.272 --> 11:51.188
Except you?
I mean, in what world

11:51.232 --> 11:52.494
do the girls abandon me
for a road trip

11:52.537 --> 11:54.235
when I'm the life of the party?

11:55.758 --> 11:58.065
What's happening here?

11:58.108 --> 11:59.806
I've been feeling
a little down lately,

11:59.849 --> 12:02.765
and I have a feeling
that it's a direct result

12:02.809 --> 12:04.941
from Seasonal
Affective Disorder.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.161
We sufferers call it "SAD."

12:07.204 --> 12:09.032
Cute name.Oh, no.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.165
It's real.
It's an upscale depression

12:11.208 --> 12:12.949
related to seasonal changes.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.434
You seem a little down, Sam.

12:19.477 --> 12:20.740
No.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.959
I'm not sad or SAD.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.482
I didn't do anything wrong.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.180
You sure?

12:26.223 --> 12:29.400
Because denial and
depression do go mano a mano.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.099
Sir, would you be a dove

12:32.142 --> 12:34.231
and go to the truck and
get another spa chair?

12:34.275 --> 12:35.711
Sure, no problem.Thank you.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.193
We are gonna turn
our sad into glad.

12:39.236 --> 12:42.022
And what does that stand for?

12:42.065 --> 12:44.894
It's just a word.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.378
We had the best time
on the slopes.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.249
You skied with a fetus?

12:52.293 --> 12:54.208
Is that allowed?People do.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.383
But I didn't.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.689
I went up and down
20 times on the gondola.

12:57.733 --> 12:58.995
You know, people look
at you funny

12:59.039 --> 13:00.692
when you don't get out
at the top.

13:00.736 --> 13:02.085
Where's Monica?

13:02.129 --> 13:04.174
Spa.Oh.

13:04.218 --> 13:06.481
Sitting in a hotel lobby
for multiple hours on end

13:06.524 --> 13:08.222
not her thing?
That's so weird.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.180
I like your outfit, Kirby.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.660
Did you just strip the first
mannequin you saw or was...

13:11.703 --> 13:12.879
There he is.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.663
There he is.
There's Liam.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.492
Okay, everybody,
act natural.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.755
Uh, now who looks
like a mannequin?

13:19.799 --> 13:23.411
You know, if I hadfeelings,
that wouldn't hurt them.

13:23.454 --> 13:27.110
Yeah. Both your skis
came off.

13:27.154 --> 13:28.111
So forget that.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.200
Ooh! Oh, my God.Whoa. Whoa.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.332
Liam?

13:31.375 --> 13:32.550
Fallon.

13:32.594 --> 13:33.900
What are you
doing here?

13:33.943 --> 13:36.424
I'll go grab us
a few beers.Okay, cool.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.513
Skiing.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.123
Why are you here?Are you kidding?

13:40.167 --> 13:41.690
I have been coming to Sun Valley

13:41.733 --> 13:44.040
with my family to ski
since forever.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.868
I'm actually here
on a girls trip.Oh.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.262
There they are. Yup.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.003
Wow. What?

13:50.046 --> 13:51.700
Hey, I, uh...

13:51.743 --> 13:53.093
I heard you cancelled
your wedding.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.008
I'm really sorry
that happened.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.184
Yeah, but here's
the funny thing about that:

13:57.227 --> 13:59.403
I have been doing a lot
of soul searching,

13:59.447 --> 14:00.709
and I've...WOMAN:
Liam?

14:00.752 --> 14:02.580
Hey. Hi.Hey. Hey.

14:02.624 --> 14:03.886
Who's this?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.410
Um, Ashley, this is
Fallon Carrington.

14:07.411 --> 14:09.413
Fallon, this is
Ashley Cunningham.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.415
So nice to meet you, Fallon.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.895
Hi.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.245
Ashley and I have known each
other since we were kids.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.247
No, since before
we were born.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.380
Our mothers are best friends.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.338
Laura loves me
like her own daughter.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.339
Ew.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.558
I mean, not "Ew."

14:23.601 --> 14:24.820
It's just,
uh, you know,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.169
I wouldn't wish that
on anyone.

14:26.213 --> 14:27.388
You know, I think

14:27.431 --> 14:30.130
you did mention Ashley
to me... once.

14:30.173 --> 14:33.698
Yeah, something about
a childish schoolgirl crush?

14:33.742 --> 14:36.049
I think you meant "childhood."Oh.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.442
Yeah, I'm sure I did.Well, we aren't kids

14:38.486 --> 14:40.314
anymore, are we?

14:40.357 --> 14:42.794
Uh, hey, Ash, can I,
uh, get you a pinot noir?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.318
I would love one,
thank you.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.362
Oh. Excuse me.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.798
Sure.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.191
Huh.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.976
I find it a little interesting

14:50.019 --> 14:52.587
that you didn't mention to Liam
that I dropped by the other day.

14:52.630 --> 14:56.417
Save it. I know why
you dropped by the other day,

14:56.460 --> 14:59.376
and I know exactly why
you're here now, Fallon.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.205
Crazy ex, right?Okay.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.947
You've had your fun,
but I think we both know

15:04.991 --> 15:07.297
that you are a rebound,
so how about

15:07.341 --> 15:09.952
you preserve your dignity
and bounce down that mountain

15:09.996 --> 15:12.433
right back to whatever sorority
you legacied out of?

15:12.476 --> 15:14.739
I was a rebound,
but it's funny

15:14.783 --> 15:18.091
how easy it is to get a man
to fall in love with you

15:18.134 --> 15:19.527
when he's been put through hell

15:19.570 --> 15:22.269
by a cold, self-serving,

15:22.312 --> 15:23.923
self-righteous bitch.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.404
I mean, you basically
starved him, and now, well,

15:27.448 --> 15:30.320
let's just say
I'm keeping him very satisfied.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.322
Be careful on the slopes,
Fallon.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.412
It's especially icy this season.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.255
Hi. I am Fallon Carrington,

15:52.299 --> 15:55.345
and I would like a large,
3-D model of the entire mountain

15:55.389 --> 15:56.956
with all the runs
and chair lifts.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.175
Oh, and a laser pointer.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.178
A trail map and a pencil.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.745
All right.

16:13.581 --> 16:15.452
You look lonely.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.585
Oh.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.761
Why, because I'm playing
vertical checkers by myself?

16:22.242 --> 16:24.244
This girls trip kind of sucks.

16:24.287 --> 16:25.897
Well, you did get a new
winter wardrobe out of it.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.380
I don't do snow.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.600
Probably 'cause
my mom only ever wanted

16:32.643 --> 16:34.776
to vacay places
that were tropical.

16:34.819 --> 16:37.648
'Cause of everything she went
through-- her divorce and

16:37.692 --> 16:41.043
depression-- I just tagged along
wherever she wanted to go.

16:41.087 --> 16:45.047
It's a tough thing to
face when you're a kid.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.963
Wow. This is why
I need more girlfriends.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.444
Or maybe not?

16:50.487 --> 16:52.750
Kirby.
We're you're friends.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.491
At least for this weekend.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.625
Tell that to Fallon.

16:57.668 --> 17:00.541
Look, you can't
tell Fallon anything.

17:00.584 --> 17:02.847
You just need to show her
that you're a good friend.

17:04.936 --> 17:06.982
I feel like
I'm in a terrarium,

17:07.026 --> 17:08.853
and it's freaking me out
a little.

17:08.897 --> 17:12.770
You'll thank me in the morning
when you feel rested and happy.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.642
And next, we float.

17:14.685 --> 17:18.646
Weren't you wondering
what those tanks were for?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.256
I was trying not to.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.085
They're sensory
deprivation tanks.

17:23.129 --> 17:26.697
Alone with your thoughts,

17:26.741 --> 17:28.177
free of distraction.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.092
Alone with only your thoughts?

17:30.136 --> 17:32.181
How is that good?
What's fun

17:32.225 --> 17:34.488
about thinking things when
you're trying not to think them?

17:34.531 --> 17:37.012
We need to know why we're sad

17:37.056 --> 17:38.753
in order to beat SAD.

17:38.796 --> 17:40.755
This is a very
complicated condition.

17:40.798 --> 17:42.800
One must take it head-on.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.110
Can't wait.

17:48.154 --> 17:51.592
Wouldn't rather be
anywhere else.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.638
I have a very simple plan
to get myself some alone time

17:54.682 --> 17:56.205
with Liam on the mountain.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.555
All I have to do is take
the Denavara lift

17:58.599 --> 17:59.774
and ski across

17:59.817 --> 18:01.906
Elk's Lane, then up
to the Bearpaw gondola,

18:01.950 --> 18:04.735
and then back up and follow him
down the Alta Peak Bowl.

18:05.780 --> 18:06.998
It's a trail
he'll eventually hit

18:07.042 --> 18:08.435
after his mid-morning
heli-skiing lesson.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.132
How do you know that?

18:10.176 --> 18:12.874
It's called Insta-stalking.
And then,

18:12.917 --> 18:15.050
I will slip into the two-person
Pine Ridge lift

18:15.094 --> 18:18.314
where I will have seven minutes
of alone time with Liam.

18:18.358 --> 18:20.490
But won't Ashley
be skiing with him?

18:20.534 --> 18:23.058
I saw the GoPro video she
uploaded from her ski lesson

18:23.102 --> 18:25.234
and she is an
intermediate skier, at best,

18:25.278 --> 18:26.714
so she won't make it past here.

18:26.757 --> 18:29.325
Although her turns
were looking sharper

18:29.369 --> 18:30.718
by the end of the lesson.

18:30.761 --> 18:33.721
Did you say simple plan
or insane plan?

18:33.764 --> 18:35.679
I'm sorry, can you do better?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.903
Hi. This is Ashley Cunningham.

18:41.946 --> 18:44.297
My boyfriend and I misplaced
our itinerary for tomorrow.

18:44.340 --> 18:46.951
Can you please tell me
what we have planned?

18:46.995 --> 18:49.867
A ski lesson
up first.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.783
Okay, and then
a spa appointment.

18:52.827 --> 18:55.351
Mm, don't want to miss that.

18:55.395 --> 18:57.875
Mm-hmm, yup.
That's also perfect.

18:57.919 --> 19:00.878
Okay. Okay,
thank you so much.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.750
Bye now.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.492
Looks like Ashley and Liam
won't be the only ones

19:05.535 --> 19:08.147
with a packed schedule
for tomorrow.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.236
Us three are gonna
take that bitch down

19:10.279 --> 19:12.542
so you can take your man home.

19:12.586 --> 19:14.196
I don't understand.
How?

19:14.240 --> 19:16.807
Uh-uh.
I feel taking a bitch down

19:16.851 --> 19:18.244
is more your thing, Kirby.

19:18.287 --> 19:19.593
Hmm.

19:19.636 --> 19:22.987
Cristal and I will distract
Ashley's preppy posse.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.642
And I'll keep Ashley busy
while you meet Liam

19:25.686 --> 19:28.167
for their previously scheduled
apres ski drinks.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.951
Like a normal stalker.

19:29.994 --> 19:33.563
Okay, I respect your
commitment to help Fallon,

19:33.607 --> 19:35.086
but you're forgetting
one major detail.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.827
CRISTAL:
She saw you, Kirby.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.568
She knows
you're friends with Fallon.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.484
Oh. That's a problem.

19:41.528 --> 19:42.877
I don't need problems.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.009
What I need
is a solution.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.795
There is a war being fought
on this mountain,

19:47.838 --> 19:50.624
and I'm not gonna let
this glam squad lose it.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.862
Oh, Culhane. You know,
I knew you'd be back.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.995
Takes a fool to say no
to Blake Carrington.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.519
Takes an even bigger fool
to say yes, but here I am.

20:16.563 --> 20:19.522
Oh, you learned a lot
under my roof,

20:19.566 --> 20:22.873
including how to spot
a good opportunity.

20:22.917 --> 20:26.268
Jerry Jones paid $150
million for the Cowboys.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.011
They're worth
five billion now.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.969
And you're comparing yourself
to Jerry Jones?

20:32.013 --> 20:33.449
No, I would never.

20:33.493 --> 20:35.843
Well, he's not in my league.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.932
So, let's jet to Belgium,

20:37.975 --> 20:40.282
close this deal with the kid.
Then, on the way back,

20:40.326 --> 20:42.241
we can talk about
what position would be right

20:42.284 --> 20:43.416
for you with the organization.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.244
I'm not here for you
to assign me a job

20:45.287 --> 20:47.463
that you have no desire
to do yourself.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.292
I'm here 'cause I can help you
with Sterling Wells.

20:50.336 --> 20:53.208
So you just want to help me
sign him and then stop there?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.731
For a small fee.Ah.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.733
I understand.

20:56.777 --> 20:59.127
And I can assure you

20:59.170 --> 21:01.782
Fallon has zero involvement
with this team.

21:03.044 --> 21:06.003
Then let's jet to Belgium.

21:06.047 --> 21:08.658
This is foolproof.

21:08.702 --> 21:11.313
There is no way Ashley's
gonna recognize me.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.446
Meet her new ski instructor.
I'll add a free ski lesson

21:13.489 --> 21:16.013
to her itinerary, and I keep her
out on the slopes all day.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.581
You're a novice skier. I mean,
what happens when you fall

21:18.625 --> 21:20.409
and red hair
comes tumbling out?

21:21.454 --> 21:22.672
Fine.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.674
Maybe we don't have to ski.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.633
I'll get her on the chairlift,
and then I'll text you,

21:26.676 --> 21:28.635
and you can cause a blackout
on the mountain,

21:28.678 --> 21:30.637
and then we'll be stranded
up there.

21:30.680 --> 21:32.987
Now, why would anyone
say that Kirby's crazy?

21:33.030 --> 21:35.859
Mm, no, I like
the spa plan better.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.861
Which also didn't work.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.298
You came, you saw,

21:39.341 --> 21:41.648
and now it's clearly
time to go home.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.612
Why are youhere?

21:49.656 --> 21:51.179
SAM:
Why did you
leave me behind?

21:51.222 --> 21:53.181
Alexis's anti-depression regimen

21:53.224 --> 21:55.444
was depressing
the hell out of me.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.925
Who wants to hit the lodge
and pound hot toddies?

21:57.968 --> 21:59.492
Oh, this is perfect.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.277
Ashley doesn't know him.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.584
Who's Ashley?

22:04.627 --> 22:08.109
Ladies... I think we just
found our secret weapon.

22:12.505 --> 22:15.116
The spa flooded?
What a drag.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.379
True, but now you get
all our services

22:17.423 --> 22:19.163
without having
to leave your room.

22:19.207 --> 22:22.123
I'm still going to contact the
spa manager for a full refund.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.211
And you should.

22:23.254 --> 22:24.778
Now, I see
you've reserved

22:24.821 --> 22:26.519
the deluxe
alpine rescue package.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.303
My entire body
is sore.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.478
Between skiing
with my boyfriend

22:29.522 --> 22:32.394
all over this mountain
and, well...

22:32.438 --> 22:34.440
I am totally
over-sharing, but...

22:34.483 --> 22:36.920
we got pretty freaky last night
at the bar, dancing,

22:36.964 --> 22:38.313
and then in bed and...

22:38.357 --> 22:40.141
then again in bed this morning.

22:40.184 --> 22:43.144
Yeah, you've had
quite an ordeal.Hello?

22:43.187 --> 22:44.319
Let's get started.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
I'm not paying you to talk.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.629
BLAKE:
I flew a long way to meet

22:49.672 --> 22:52.632
with you and your agent,
Sterling. Private, of course.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.460
Which is what you'll be flying

22:54.503 --> 22:56.418
if you commit
to my expansion team.

22:56.462 --> 22:57.724
Oh, hell,

22:57.767 --> 22:59.856
you can just buy your own plane.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.467
Do you have numbers
for me, Blake?

23:05.166 --> 23:07.211
Now, that's guaranteed.
It's a monster deal. It's worth

23:07.255 --> 23:09.518
more money than any American
soccer player's ever made.

23:09.562 --> 23:12.129
Sports apparel companies,
athletic drinks--

23:12.173 --> 23:13.783
they are gonna be kicking
your door down for endorsements.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.350
If...

23:15.394 --> 23:16.699
you come back to Atlanta.

23:16.743 --> 23:17.961
My client

23:18.005 --> 23:19.659
already makes
a great deal of money.

23:19.702 --> 23:22.226
My watch costs more
than my parents' house.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.532
Crazy, right?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.491
I paid off their house,
by the way.

23:25.534 --> 23:26.883
And bought them
matching watches.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.885
BLAKE:
Yeah, I like to buy
nice things, too.

23:28.929 --> 23:32.454
And if you accept this deal...

23:32.498 --> 23:35.109
there won't be one single thing

23:35.152 --> 23:38.286
on this planet that you
won't be able to buy.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.722
Now, that's power.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.811
I have that power,
I love that power,

23:41.855 --> 23:43.987
and I want you
to have that power, too.

23:44.031 --> 23:47.469
I love playing soccer, man.
I got enough power

23:47.513 --> 23:49.210
that I don't have to be
treated like a pawn

23:49.253 --> 23:51.734
by some rich dude who just needs
a face to launch his new team.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.910
Whoa, whoa, whoa.Hey, why don't you
give me five.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.654
Alone.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.179
Howard, why don't you and me
step outside

24:02.223 --> 24:04.443
and dig into specifics.

24:11.275 --> 24:13.321
That guy's a jerk.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.018
Which one?

24:16.933 --> 24:19.501
I played outside linebacker
at Decatur High School

24:19.545 --> 24:22.025
a couple years
before you got there.Yeah?

24:22.069 --> 24:24.027
Go Bulldogs.

24:24.071 --> 24:26.943
Hey, I was killing it
in college, on track to go pro,

24:26.987 --> 24:29.032
but then I blew out my knee.

24:29.076 --> 24:31.208
That dream died hard.

24:31.252 --> 24:33.472
Damn. That's tough.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.909
Yeah. My greatest memories
are my mom, my dad

24:35.952 --> 24:38.477
and my baby sister
at every game.

24:38.520 --> 24:41.131
I could see them cheering me on.

24:41.175 --> 24:42.785
That's cool.

24:42.829 --> 24:45.440
Yeah, it was like
the whole city embraced me.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.529
It was the best.

24:47.573 --> 24:51.446
So, yeah, having an amazing
career abroad is killer,

24:51.490 --> 24:53.535
but you know
what's even better?

24:53.579 --> 24:56.364
Being the king at home.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.322
Like when LeBron

24:58.366 --> 25:00.542
won a ring
for Cleveland.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.762
Let me show you something.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.810
Nah, man, you're just like
the Carrington clown.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.508
I don't want to see your money.

25:10.726 --> 25:14.338
What? Boiled peanuts
from Hickabilly Hank's?

25:14.382 --> 25:17.733
You're not gonna
find those in Brussels.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.563
My mom and I used to go to that
stand after every practice.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.131
She knew as long as I was
popping peanuts in my mouth,

25:24.174 --> 25:25.567
I was an open book.

25:25.611 --> 25:29.179
Yeah, we had a lot of good
talks because of these.

25:29.223 --> 25:31.138
I'm going to start by placing

25:31.181 --> 25:33.706
a lavender-scented pillow

25:33.749 --> 25:35.577
over your eyes,Mmm...

25:35.621 --> 25:38.580
and all you need to do now
is relax and enjoy

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
as my team works on you.

25:44.673 --> 25:47.676
Hey, Ashley, you ready for me
to shape those brows today?

25:47.720 --> 25:50.287
Just make sure
they aren't too skinny.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.768
I'm very picky, and I don't want
to scare you, but if there is

25:52.812 --> 25:54.640
one hair out of place,
I'm complaining to your boss.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.817
What color nails are
we thinking today?

25:57.860 --> 25:59.166
Ballet tutu pink.

25:59.209 --> 26:01.603
Anything brighter's
so working-class.

26:01.647 --> 26:02.735
I-I mean...

26:02.778 --> 26:04.519
it's just not classy.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.825
With your permission, Ashley,

26:05.868 --> 26:07.217
we're gonna upgrade
your package today.

26:07.261 --> 26:10.177
It's called the best of beauty,

26:10.220 --> 26:12.309
and, well...
we think you deserve it.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.007
Of course I deserve it.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.575
You have no idea
how stressful my life is.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.881
And you have no idea
what you're in for.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.709
Just...

26:20.753 --> 26:22.668
relax.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.861
This'll just...

26:41.904 --> 26:44.864
give your hair some... volume.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.128
All done.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.696
Don't forget to take
our customer survey.

27:16.765 --> 27:18.506
Fallon.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.073
Uh...Relax.

27:20.116 --> 27:22.902
There's nothing wrong with two
old friends playing catch-up.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.643
So that's what we are?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.514
We do have a history.

27:26.557 --> 27:28.168
Sure, it might not
go as far back

27:28.211 --> 27:29.691
as you and what's-her-face, but

27:29.735 --> 27:32.651
you left an indelible mark
on my past, so...

27:32.694 --> 27:35.697
that's got to count
for something.That's fair.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.352
And I assume you're
referring to Ashley.

27:38.395 --> 27:40.702
I made a mistake.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.878
Turns out I'm human.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.880
See, now, that admission

27:44.924 --> 27:46.665
is something
for the history books.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.711
Well...

27:49.755 --> 27:51.452
you were right.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.672
Culhane was not my one.

27:53.715 --> 27:57.197
And I realized something
that you knew immediately.

27:57.240 --> 28:00.417
You are my one, Liam.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.857
I'm just sorry it took me
so long to figure it out.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.731
Um...

28:09.775 --> 28:11.385
Fallon, there's...

28:11.428 --> 28:14.170
there's no point
in rehashing the past.

28:15.998 --> 28:17.783
I'm really happy right now.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.785
Okay, but, I mean, you...

28:19.828 --> 28:21.351
We were happy.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.744
We could have been.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.703
We still can be.
We can start fresh.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.400
Yeah, see, that's
exactly it.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.619
I havestarted fresh.

28:28.663 --> 28:30.621
I moved on.
If you care about me

28:30.665 --> 28:31.927
as much as you say you do,

28:31.971 --> 28:34.538
then I'd like for you
to respect that.

28:34.582 --> 28:37.585
Let's remember our marriage
with fondness and move on.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.239
Deal?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.286
Fine.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.027
I'm only doing it

28:45.071 --> 28:47.029
because of how much
I care about you, Liam.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.560
Thank you, Fallon.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.667
MONICA:
I'm not comfortable here.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.060
Yeah, it's pretty stinky.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.235
And sticky.Yeah, which means

29:19.279 --> 29:20.628
Liam will not
be here, okay?

29:20.671 --> 29:22.761
I mean, this is
where the locals go.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.806
Local murderers?

29:24.850 --> 29:25.938
CRISTAL:
You did

29:25.981 --> 29:27.766
the right thing, Fallon.Well, clearly,

29:27.809 --> 29:29.768
I don't have much
practice with that,

29:29.811 --> 29:31.247
because I thought
I would feel better.

29:31.291 --> 29:33.206
But Liam and I are over.

29:33.249 --> 29:36.165
Which means that Serena van der
Woodsen knockoff gets him.

29:36.209 --> 29:39.690
That's fine. So I am sorry
for bringing you all here.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.997
I wish we could leave
this mountain ASAP,

29:42.041 --> 29:44.043
but unfortunately, Blake
has the jet in Belgium,

29:44.086 --> 29:46.349
and it won't be able
to get us till morning.We can fly commercial.

29:46.393 --> 29:49.004
Mm. Yeah, we could also eat
that mystery meat chili,

29:49.048 --> 29:50.832
but we're not gonna
do that either.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.791
Look, we're
stuck here,

29:52.834 --> 29:54.836
so let's just salvage
what's left of this girls trip

29:54.880 --> 29:56.795
and have a girls
night, okay?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.144
Drinks are on me.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.581
'Cause I am a miserable loser.

30:05.194 --> 30:08.154
Hey. We could really use
this table for people.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.938
Okay if I check your stuff?

30:09.982 --> 30:11.418
Yeah, that's fine.Thanks.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.551
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.075
Easy with the leather
on that bag.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.250
Okay.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.294
Well...

30:18.338 --> 30:19.774
you were right.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.776
Chasing Liam here
was a terrible idea.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.734
I'm so sorry
it didn't work out.

30:23.778 --> 30:27.260
I know we're not
super close, Fallon,

30:27.303 --> 30:30.524
but if I can help you
in any way,

30:30.567 --> 30:32.308
just let me know.

30:32.352 --> 30:35.442
I mean, touching your hair would
make me feel a little better.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.313
Not here.

30:37.357 --> 30:40.360
Okay. So, later, then?

30:40.403 --> 30:42.057
I'm a miserable loser, too.

30:42.101 --> 30:44.190
And I thought that getting
away would help me forget

30:44.233 --> 30:47.323
that I kissed a man
that's not Steven, but, uh...

30:47.367 --> 30:49.804
the guilt is killing me.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.328
Must be all these hot guys.

30:52.372 --> 30:53.242
Oh, Sam.

30:53.286 --> 30:55.157
You're an idiot.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.333
That's comforting.Beating yourself up

30:57.377 --> 30:59.509
over a tiny indiscretion
is a complete waste

30:59.553 --> 31:01.729
on our last night away together.

31:01.772 --> 31:04.906
I once read you can't let your
previous actions define you.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.387
You can only control
what you do next.

31:07.430 --> 31:08.562
That's genius.

31:08.605 --> 31:09.911
Who wrote it?

31:09.955 --> 31:11.260
Oh, some
Instagram hippie.

31:11.304 --> 31:12.522
MONICA:
Hey, Dominique.

31:12.566 --> 31:13.915
It's Monica.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.613
I know I haven't seen you
in such a long time,

31:16.657 --> 31:18.877
and I don't want to say anything
that'll break your heart,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.401
so here's my suggestion.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.316
Don't you dare
get on Jeff's plane

31:23.359 --> 31:27.276
or I will unload 12 years
of pain and suffering on you

31:27.320 --> 31:30.366
and make you pay
for what you did to me.

31:32.978 --> 31:33.935
Understood.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.416
Thank you, Howard.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.460
So?

31:37.504 --> 31:39.288
Good news.
Sterling wants

31:39.332 --> 31:41.290
to come home
and play in Atlanta.

31:41.334 --> 31:44.293
Yes. My plan worked
like a charm.

31:44.337 --> 31:45.338
And, as promised,

31:45.381 --> 31:47.470
you will be rewarded
for your efforts

31:47.514 --> 31:49.820
with a position
in the organization.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.910
I'm thinking, uh...

31:51.953 --> 31:53.302
player relations.

31:53.346 --> 31:55.826
So, here's the thing
about your plan.

31:55.870 --> 31:58.786
You know, there are
two pro soccer teams in Atlanta.

31:58.829 --> 32:01.310
And Sterling
will only play for one

32:01.354 --> 32:03.486
that has me as part-owner.

32:03.530 --> 32:04.966
So what are you saying?

32:05.010 --> 32:06.620
Well, that can
be your team, Blake,

32:06.663 --> 32:09.884
or the other one,
who I've already spoken with.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.755
And they're very interested.

32:11.799 --> 32:14.410
So why don't you come up
with another plan...

32:14.454 --> 32:17.022
and maybe I'll entertain it.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.675
Hmm.

32:18.719 --> 32:20.503
Troops,

32:20.547 --> 32:23.985
there is domestic swill sticking
to the bottom of my shoes.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.596
I say it's time to polish up
our drinks and head home.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.468
There's a strict
no vom policy on the plane.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.687
I don't know. Looks like
there are some hotties in here.

32:30.731 --> 32:33.081
That's the booze
and your bad taste talking.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.561
Here you go.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.432
Thank you. Oh, you know what,
my wallet is in my bag.

32:36.476 --> 32:38.608
Will you please get us our stuff
from the coat check?

32:38.652 --> 32:41.437
Does this place look
like it has a coat check?

32:41.481 --> 32:43.004
Well, that's ridiculous.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.441
A woman came over and she took
our coats and our bags.

32:45.485 --> 32:47.052
This is from a car wash.

32:47.095 --> 32:48.575
What?

32:48.618 --> 32:49.924
Oh, my God. I told you,

32:49.968 --> 32:51.882
this place is filled
with garbage people.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.362
Someone stole
our coats

32:53.406 --> 32:55.712
and our bags?I really liked
my new coat.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.106
With our money
and our cell phones?

32:58.150 --> 33:00.630
Whose idea was it to
come to a shady bar

33:00.674 --> 33:04.199
on the side of a
mountain in Idaho?

33:04.243 --> 33:06.462
Well, it's not my fault.

33:06.506 --> 33:07.550
It may be my fault.

33:07.594 --> 33:08.551
Look,

33:08.595 --> 33:09.552
we got a hefty tab.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.163
Somebody needs to pay.

33:11.206 --> 33:12.381
Oh! I have my phone.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.514
I'll just call Jeff.
He'll send us money.

33:14.557 --> 33:16.385
And it's dead.

33:16.429 --> 33:18.387
You want to buy
a used phone?

Did you enjoy

34:46.562 --> 34:48.564
your best of beauty
upgrade, Ashley?

34:48.608 --> 34:49.478
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:49.522 --> 34:51.611
You want a piece of my friend,

34:51.654 --> 34:52.525
you're gonna have to go

34:52.568 --> 34:53.743
through me first.

34:53.787 --> 34:56.094
Your friend? Aw.

34:56.529 --> 34:58.966
Not on my watch, perrita.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.577
SAM: Ladies,

35:01.621 --> 35:02.709
can't we all just get along?

35:02.752 --> 35:05.581
Watch out!

35:06.191 --> 35:08.149
She's pregnant.

35:08.193 --> 35:11.196
And nobody touches that hair
before I do.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.286
MAN: Hey, look out!SAM: Kirby!

35:14.329 --> 35:16.244
Jab, jab, uppercut.

35:16.288 --> 35:17.767
MONICA: Help Kirby!

35:17.811 --> 35:19.639
Hell yeah. Winter's coming.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.598
Okay, who threw that?

35:22.642 --> 35:24.122
Oh, no.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.688
Winter's here, bitch.

35:32.521 --> 35:34.001
Don't worry.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.438
I won't tell my father that
his pregnant soon-to-be wife

35:36.482 --> 35:38.179
laid out a few chicks
in a bar fight.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.963
Although it is
a pretty killer story.

35:40.007 --> 35:41.313
You're sweet,

35:41.356 --> 35:43.576
but that's not
what I'm stressing about.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.055
Then what is it?

35:45.099 --> 35:47.536
I have to admit, I...

35:47.580 --> 35:50.235
had other motives
for coming on this trip.

35:50.278 --> 35:52.411
You duped me?

35:52.454 --> 35:54.108
Respect.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.327
I'm not sure the baby's Blake's.

35:55.370 --> 35:57.590
Less respect, Cristal.

35:57.633 --> 35:59.418
When I left Atlanta,

35:59.461 --> 36:01.246
I went home
and made a huge mistake

36:01.289 --> 36:03.204
by sleeping with my ex-husband.

36:03.248 --> 36:04.336
Your ex-husband?

36:04.379 --> 36:06.207
Mark Jennings.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.340
Life can take you in directions
you can't control.

36:08.383 --> 36:12.213
Never in my wildest
dreams did I imagine

36:12.257 --> 36:13.780
I was gonna end up
back in Atlanta,

36:13.823 --> 36:15.347
falling in love with Blake.

36:15.390 --> 36:19.002
So, as much as I came here
to avoid him and his doctors,

36:19.046 --> 36:20.917
I came to get your advice.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.397
Well, that's never a good idea.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.573
What should
I do, Fallon?

36:24.617 --> 36:27.489
I'm afraid he'll go crazy
if this baby isn't his.

36:27.533 --> 36:30.318
Well, you're not wrong.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.320
I say move to Idaho.

36:32.364 --> 36:33.974
They need a coat check girl.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.543
I've seen him angry.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.414
It scares me.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.549
You know what you need to do.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.681
You need to tell him the truth.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.683
And if he can't handle it,
that's his problem.

36:47.727 --> 36:50.251
You think so?Yes.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.819
You are not responsible
for the way he reacts.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.821
But you can
and you should control

36:54.864 --> 36:56.910
how you take care of yourself
and that baby.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.173
No matter whose it is.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.577
Ashley isn't pressing charges.

37:11.620 --> 37:12.708
Her friends
saw you come in here,

37:12.752 --> 37:13.927
so she paid someone
to steal your stuff,

37:13.970 --> 37:15.320
in retaliation for what

37:15.363 --> 37:16.408
your posse
over here did to her.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.323
Hey, Liam.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.585
I'm sorry, okay?

37:19.628 --> 37:21.151
I think there's been
a huge misunderstanding.

37:21.195 --> 37:22.414
No, I think
I understand perfectly, Fallon.

37:22.457 --> 37:24.416
You came here
to destroy my relationship.

37:24.459 --> 37:25.852
That's not true.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.332
Okay.And, for the record,
your girlfriend

37:27.375 --> 37:28.507
committed larceny.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.378
She's lucky
I'm not pressing charges.

37:30.422 --> 37:33.076
You are not the same person
that I fell in love with.

37:33.120 --> 37:34.861
What happened
to the girl who was ready

37:34.904 --> 37:36.819
to start her own dynasty?

37:36.863 --> 37:38.386
The savvy,
sophisticated woman

37:38.430 --> 37:40.432
who outmaneuvered
the brightest in business?

37:40.475 --> 37:43.478
You're acting like
a childish schoolgirl.

37:44.523 --> 37:47.395
Liam, please.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.745
I'm sorry.

37:49.789 --> 37:52.400
I took it too far.

37:52.444 --> 37:55.403
Doesn't this prove how
much I care about you?

37:55.447 --> 37:57.449
No, Fallon.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.842
It proves how low you've sunk.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.453
You know, there was a time

38:01.496 --> 38:03.411
when I thought
I couldn't live without you.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.459
Now I can't
stand the sight of you.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.819
How was the
girls trip?

38:20.863 --> 38:22.387
Youwere invited?

38:22.430 --> 38:25.433
Mm. You missed quite
an adventure, Alexis.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.958
I knew youwere gone,

38:29.002 --> 38:31.961
after what seemed
like a 15-hour float.

38:32.005 --> 38:33.485
I'm sorry I bailed
on you, but I didn't

38:33.528 --> 38:35.313
want to make you sadder.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.532
This type of sadder.

38:37.576 --> 38:38.881
Thank you, Sam.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.493
Well, while I was floating,

38:41.536 --> 38:43.669
I realized
that I don't have SAD.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.323
I am sad.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.455
Nobody wants me here, and

38:47.499 --> 38:49.022
nobody needs me.
And Cristal

38:49.065 --> 38:50.850
has weaseled her way
into this family,

38:50.893 --> 38:52.852
and now she's been crowned

38:52.895 --> 38:56.290
as the new queen of the manor.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.466
Meanwhile,
what am I doing?

38:58.510 --> 39:00.294
I just feel...

39:00.338 --> 39:01.643
directionless.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.079
I get that.

39:03.123 --> 39:05.647
While I was escaping,

39:05.691 --> 39:08.476
I realized that
I've done things I regret.

39:08.520 --> 39:10.870
Steven has done things I regret.

39:10.913 --> 39:13.220
But it's not healthy
to dwell on them.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.570
So I'm moving forward,

39:15.614 --> 39:17.224
taking care of myself.

39:17.267 --> 39:18.486
I'm sorry you're sad.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.663
Don't worry.
I will be just fine.

39:24.666 --> 39:28.278
I'm not sure I can say the same
for the weasel queen.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.370
Where's Mom?

39:33.414 --> 39:35.634
Mom didn't get on the plane.
