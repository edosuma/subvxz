00:20.389 --> 00:23.058
The ceremony will be carried
on all viewing screens, sir.

00:23.225 --> 00:24.506
Good.

00:26.353 --> 00:28.013
There's a call for you
from the bridge.

00:34.152 --> 00:35.563
- Kirk here.
- Still no answer

00:35.737 --> 00:37.943
from Earth Outpost Number 2,
captain.

00:38.114 --> 00:40.688
And now Number 3 has gone silent.

00:45.288 --> 00:48.538
Maintain course to Outpost 4.
Keep me informed.

00:48.708 --> 00:50.166
Kirk out.

01:21.489 --> 01:23.528
Since the days of
the first wooden vessels,

01:23.699 --> 01:27.150
all shipmasters
have had one happy privilege.

01:27.495 --> 01:30.068
That of uniting two people
in the bonds of matrimony.

01:30.247 --> 01:33.746
And so we are gathered here today
with you, Angela Martine,

01:33.917 --> 01:37.915
and you, Robert Tomlinson,
in the sight of your fellows,

01:38.296 --> 01:41.546
in accordance with our laws
and our many beliefs,

01:41.716 --> 01:45.584
- so that you may pledge your...
- Alert! Alert! All decks, alert!

01:45.762 --> 01:47.719
Alert! Alert!
Captain to the bridge!

01:47.889 --> 01:50.047
- All decks, alert!
- Kirk here.

01:50.224 --> 01:52.431
Earth Outpost 4
reports they're under attack.

01:52.602 --> 01:54.725
A space vessel, identity unknown.

01:54.896 --> 01:57.600
Full ahead.
All decks, Condition Red.

02:02.569 --> 02:04.692
All decks, Condition Red.

02:04.863 --> 02:07.948
All decks, Condition Red.

02:15.540 --> 02:19.288
Space, the final frontier.

02:19.502 --> 02:23.120
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:23.297 --> 02:28.090
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:28.302 --> 02:31.256
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:32.223 --> 02:35.888
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:09.508 --> 03:13.208
Captain's log, stardate 1709.2.

03:13.387 --> 03:15.213
Patrolling outposts guarding
the Neutral Zone

03:15.389 --> 03:18.840
between planets Romulus and Remus
and the rest of the galaxy

03:19.017 --> 03:21.852
received emergency call
from Outpost 4.

03:22.020 --> 03:25.223
The USS Enterprise is moving
to investigate and assist.

03:25.398 --> 03:28.185
Outpost 4 reported under attack, sir.

03:28.359 --> 03:30.352
Then message terminates.

03:30.528 --> 03:32.686
Verified, captain.

03:34.532 --> 03:36.109
Our speed is now maximum, sir.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.537
Position, eight minutes from Outpost 4
at this velocity, sir.

03:46.418 --> 03:47.746
- Scotty...
- I've already talked

03:47.919 --> 03:51.039
to my engine room, sir.
We'll get more speed out of her.

03:56.427 --> 03:59.512
Did Outpost 4 give anything at all
on the attacking vessel, lieutenant?

03:59.681 --> 04:00.843
No identification, sir.

04:01.015 --> 04:02.889
There can't be much doubt
who's attacking, sir.

04:07.897 --> 04:09.557
Mr. Spock...

04:10.232 --> 04:12.391
...put this star sector
on our screen.

04:21.451 --> 04:22.732
Now show our position.

04:34.130 --> 04:36.621
Signal this to all decks, lieutenant.

04:38.342 --> 04:41.711
- All decks standing by, sir.
- This is the captain speaking.

04:41.887 --> 04:46.181
In our next action, we can risk
neither miscalculation nor error

04:46.725 --> 04:48.219
by any man aboard.

04:48.393 --> 04:50.849
Listen carefully. Science officer.

04:51.021 --> 04:53.263
Referring to the map on your screens,
you will note,

04:53.440 --> 04:55.765
beyond the moving position
of our vessel,

04:55.942 --> 04:58.433
a line of Earth outpost stations.

04:58.611 --> 05:02.443
Constructed on asteroids,
they monitor the Neutral Zone,

05:02.615 --> 05:05.651
established by treaty
after the Earth-Romulan Conflict

05:05.827 --> 05:07.107
of over a century ago.

05:07.453 --> 05:09.280
As you may recall
from your histories,

05:09.455 --> 05:12.325
this conflict was fought,
by our standards today,

05:12.500 --> 05:16.283
with primitive atomic weapons
and in primitive space vessels,

05:16.462 --> 05:20.329
which allowed no quarter,
no captives.

05:20.507 --> 05:23.461
Nor was there even ship-to-ship
visual communication.

05:23.885 --> 05:29.721
Therefore, no human, Romulan or ally
has ever seen the other.

05:30.308 --> 05:36.477
Earth believes the Romulans
to be warlike, cruel, treacherous.

05:36.814 --> 05:39.436
And only the Romulans know
what they think of Earth.

05:40.151 --> 05:42.606
The treaty, set by subspace radio,

05:42.778 --> 05:45.483
established this Neutral Zone,

05:45.656 --> 05:48.194
entry into which, by either side,

05:48.367 --> 05:50.905
would constitute an act of war.

05:51.453 --> 05:54.489
The treaty has been unbroken
since that time.

05:54.957 --> 05:56.616
Captain.

05:58.043 --> 06:00.450
What you do not know
and must now be told

06:00.629 --> 06:03.914
is that my command orders on this
subject are precise and inviolable.

06:04.090 --> 06:06.663
No act, no provocation...

06:06.843 --> 06:09.678
... will be considered sufficient reason
to violate the zone.

06:09.846 --> 06:13.179
We may defend ourselves,
but, if necessary,

06:13.349 --> 06:15.342
to avoid interspace war,

06:15.518 --> 06:20.512
both these outposts and this vessel
will be considered expendable.

06:20.689 --> 06:22.231
Captain out.

06:24.193 --> 06:25.984
We know Outpost 4
has been attacked, sir,

06:26.153 --> 06:27.695
so if we intercept
the Romulans now...

06:27.863 --> 06:30.698
After a whole century, what will
a Romulan ship look like, Mr. Stiles?

06:30.866 --> 06:32.858
I doubt if they'll radio
and identify themselves.

06:33.034 --> 06:36.035
You'll know, sir. They're painted
like a giant bird of prey.

06:36.204 --> 06:38.362
I had no idea that history
was your speciality.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.331
Family history.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.872
There was a Captain Stiles
in the space service then.

06:43.044 --> 06:45.202
Two commanders,
several junior officers.

06:45.379 --> 06:49.044
- All lost in that war, sir.
- Their war, Mr. Stiles.

06:51.802 --> 06:53.047
Not yours.

06:54.722 --> 06:56.381
Don't forget it.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.047
Yes, sir.

06:58.559 --> 07:01.678
Outpost 2 coming
into sensor range, captain.

07:01.853 --> 07:04.095
Outpost 2 was the first
to go silent, lieutenant?

07:04.272 --> 07:07.226
Yes, captain.
Then Outpost 3 an hour later.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.607
Sweeping the area of Outpost 2.
Sensor reading, indefinite.

07:12.780 --> 07:17.323
Double-checking Outpost 3.
I read dust and debris.

07:17.493 --> 07:19.901
Both Earth outposts gone.

07:20.413 --> 07:23.663
And the asteroids
they were constructed on...

07:25.125 --> 07:26.157
...pulverized.

07:38.263 --> 07:41.133
Open a channel
to our nearest command base.

07:41.307 --> 07:43.633
Quarter-hour reports
on our position and status.

07:43.810 --> 07:45.518
Yes, sir.

07:47.271 --> 07:49.063
Call battle stations, Mr. Sulu.

07:51.067 --> 07:54.767
Battle stations.
All hands to battle stations.

07:54.945 --> 07:58.361
Battle stations. Battle stations.
All decks acknowledge.

07:58.699 --> 08:01.902
All decks acknowledge, sir.
All stations show green.

08:02.244 --> 08:04.486
Energize main phasers, Mr. Stiles.

08:04.663 --> 08:08.032
- All weapons to full power.
- All weapons to full power.

08:08.542 --> 08:09.573
Phaser Control Room,

08:09.960 --> 08:12.877
energize. Acknowledge.

08:13.171 --> 08:17.500
Phaser Control acknowledging.
All weapons energizing to full.

08:19.135 --> 08:21.424
Happy wedding day. Almost.

08:22.763 --> 08:25.550
You won't get off my hook
this easily.

08:25.725 --> 08:27.800
I'm gonna marry you, mister,

08:27.977 --> 08:30.302
battle or phaser weapons
notwithstanding.

08:30.729 --> 08:33.018
Well, meanwhile,
temporarily, at least,

08:33.190 --> 08:35.063
I'm still your superior officer.

08:35.234 --> 08:37.475
So get with it, mister.

08:38.445 --> 08:40.687
- Port weapons show ready.
- Starboard, midship weapons

08:40.864 --> 08:42.405
- show ready.
- Acknowledge.

08:42.573 --> 08:44.981
All weapons batteries ready.

08:45.410 --> 08:47.486
Outpost 4,
now five minutes away, sir.

08:47.662 --> 08:51.362
And showing on my sensors, captain.
At least it's still there.

08:51.541 --> 08:55.752
Sir, regaining contact with Outpost 4.
Switching to speakers.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.502
Out... Outpost 4.
Do you read me, Enterprise?

08:59.673 --> 09:01.749
This is Commander Hansen.

09:01.926 --> 09:04.677
Kirk here. We're minutes away,
Hansen. What's your status?

09:04.845 --> 09:08.214
Outposts 2, 3 and 8 are gone.

09:08.390 --> 09:10.762
Unknown weapon.
Completely destroyed,

09:11.435 --> 09:15.895
even though we were alerted.
Had our deflector shield on maximum.

09:16.064 --> 09:18.389
Hit by enormous power.

09:18.566 --> 09:21.353
First attack
blew our deflector shield.

09:21.527 --> 09:25.062
If they hit us again
with our deflector shield gone...

09:25.531 --> 09:28.698
- Do you read me, Enterprise?
- Confirm what hit you, Hansen.

09:28.868 --> 09:30.576
What vessel? Identity.

09:30.745 --> 09:34.694
Space vessel... only glimpse of...

09:34.873 --> 09:37.660
- Can you locate the intruder for us?
- Negative.

09:37.835 --> 09:40.504
It seems to have
disappeared somehow.

09:41.421 --> 09:44.541
I have you on my screen now.
Switching to visual.

09:45.008 --> 09:48.543
- Tie us in.
- Tied in, sir.

10:05.528 --> 10:08.065
Enterprise, can you see it?

10:08.238 --> 10:10.646
My command post here.

10:11.658 --> 10:14.328
We're a mile deep, on an asteroid,

10:14.703 --> 10:19.365
almost solid iron, and even
through our deflectors, it did this.

10:19.541 --> 10:22.411
- Can you see?
- Affirmative. You're visual, Hansen.

10:22.585 --> 10:25.670
- What do you have on the intruder?
- No identification.

10:25.838 --> 10:29.373
No answer to our challenge.
Only a glimpse of...

10:30.051 --> 10:35.258
Then it fired something at us.
Some form of high-energy plasma.

10:35.431 --> 10:39.760
Fantastic power. And then
the whole vessel disappeared.

10:40.310 --> 10:44.094
But it's out there somewhere.
Our sensors show that much.

10:44.815 --> 10:48.314
Enterprise, something coming
on our viewing screen.

10:48.527 --> 10:51.018
- Coming at us fast.
- Lock us onto your screen.

10:51.947 --> 10:53.524
Switching.

10:53.698 --> 10:57.565
Can you see it, Enterprise?
Can you see it?

10:58.036 --> 11:01.120
It's becoming visible
in the centre of my screen.

11:01.289 --> 11:03.365
Do you have phaser capacity?
We're still out of range.

11:03.541 --> 11:06.791
Negative. Phasers, gone.
Weapons crew, dead.

11:06.961 --> 11:08.752
Make a challenge.
Warn that ship off.

11:08.921 --> 11:11.708
I'm trying to, sir.
They don't acknowledge.

11:46.457 --> 11:48.663
Outpost 4...

11:49.793 --> 11:51.869
...disintegrated, captain.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.754
- Position of the intruder, Mr. Spock.
- Disappeared.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.251
Interesting how they became visible
for just a moment.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.505
When they opened fire.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.930
Perhaps necessary
when they use their weapon.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.508
I have a blip on the motion sensor,
captain.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.722
- Could be the intruder.
- Go to full magnification.

12:11.897 --> 12:13.142
Screen is on full mag, sir.

12:16.443 --> 12:17.606
I don't see anything.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.990
I can't understand it.

12:24.159 --> 12:26.198
Invisibility is theoretically possible,
captain.

12:26.369 --> 12:29.287
The selective bending of light.
But the power cost is enormous.

12:29.456 --> 12:31.199
They may have solved that problem.

12:31.374 --> 12:33.912
Continuing to challenge, sir.
Still no response.

12:34.085 --> 12:35.544
Discontinue.

12:35.712 --> 12:38.915
Contact remaining outposts,
have them signal us any sightings

12:39.090 --> 12:41.047
- or sensor readings in their area.
- Yes, sir.

12:41.217 --> 12:43.008
Blip has changed its heading,
captain.

12:45.346 --> 12:49.806
And in a very leisurely manoeuvre.
They may not be aware of us.

12:50.059 --> 12:52.894
Their invisibility screen
may work both ways.

12:53.061 --> 12:55.220
With that kind
of power consumption...

12:56.648 --> 12:58.142
...they may not be able to see us.

12:58.483 --> 13:00.310
His heading is now 111...

13:01.861 --> 13:03.735
...mark 14.

13:04.155 --> 13:06.990
The exact heading
a Romulan vessel would take, Jim,

13:07.158 --> 13:10.194
toward the Neutral Zone... and home.

13:19.628 --> 13:20.743
Parallel course.

13:20.921 --> 13:22.664
Don't you mean
interception course, sir?

13:22.840 --> 13:25.544
Negative. You and Mr. Sulu
will match course and speed

13:25.717 --> 13:28.802
with the object on our sensors,
exactly move-for-move.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.093
If he has sensors...

13:31.264 --> 13:35.131
...I want him to think that we're
a reflection, an echo.

13:35.310 --> 13:36.852
Under no circumstances
are you to cross

13:37.020 --> 13:38.929
into the Neutral Zone
without my direct orders.

13:39.439 --> 13:41.764
- Acknowledged, sir.
- Cancel battle stations.

13:41.941 --> 13:44.942
- All decks, standby alert.
- Cancel battle stations, sir.

13:45.111 --> 13:48.776
Captain, may I respectfully remind
the captain what has happened.

13:48.948 --> 13:50.656
The Romulans have crossed
the Neutral Zone,

13:50.824 --> 13:52.484
attacked our outposts,
killed our men.

13:52.660 --> 13:54.154
- Mr. Stiles...
- Add to that the fact

13:54.328 --> 13:55.952
- it was a sneak attack.
- Mr. Stiles,

13:56.121 --> 13:58.279
- are you questioning my orders?
- Negative, sir.

13:58.457 --> 14:01.623
I'm pointing out that we could have
Romulan spies aboard this ship.

14:07.298 --> 14:09.125
I agree, sir.

14:09.467 --> 14:13.512
Respectfully recommend all decks
maintain security alert.

14:15.139 --> 14:17.547
Very well. All decks, security alert.

14:17.725 --> 14:19.267
Security alert, sir.

14:21.729 --> 14:23.271
Picking up communication, sir.

14:25.733 --> 14:28.306
- It's from their ship.
- Pipe it in.

14:31.822 --> 14:35.487
- Sounds like code, sir.
- I have a fix on it, captain.

14:38.662 --> 14:41.828
I believe I can lock on it,
get a picture of their bridge.

14:41.998 --> 14:43.409
Put it on the screen.

15:58.404 --> 15:59.602
Decoding?

15:59.780 --> 16:03.778
- Cryptography is working on it, sir.
- Give it to Spock.

16:04.284 --> 16:06.360
I didn't quite get that, Mr. Stiles.

16:06.537 --> 16:07.912
- Nothing, sir.
- Repeat it.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.243
I was suggesting that Mr. Spock
could probably translate it for you, sir.

16:12.417 --> 16:16.249
I assume you're complimenting
Mr. Spock on his ability to decode.

16:16.421 --> 16:18.460
I'm not sure, sir.

16:20.508 --> 16:23.462
Well, here's one thing
you can be sure of, mister.

16:24.053 --> 16:28.264
Leave any bigotry in your quarters.
There's no room for it on the bridge.

16:28.432 --> 16:32.300
- Do I make myself clear?
- You do, sir.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.310
Transmission has been cut off.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.779
- I made a tape of it, sir.
- Very well.

17:00.379 --> 17:04.127
Something visual ahead, captain.
At extreme range.

17:08.303 --> 17:10.296
He's changing course, sir.

17:10.888 --> 17:13.890
- Stay with him, helm.
- Turning, sir.

17:26.487 --> 17:28.527
We grow visible.
Attend the cloaking system.

17:28.698 --> 17:30.690
It consumes much power,
commander. With no enemy...

17:30.867 --> 17:34.318
That Earth outpost called
to an Earth vessel. Now it follows us.

17:34.495 --> 17:36.452
Which neither retreats
nor grows nearer.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.282
Which turns as we turn.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.746
Commander, it is our judgement
we run from a reflection.

17:40.918 --> 17:45.129
Perhaps so,
but my judgement prevails.

17:55.431 --> 17:57.554
Cloaking system on, sir.

18:01.938 --> 18:04.855
It is good we approach
the Neutral Zone.

18:05.566 --> 18:09.184
Not too soon for me
to see the stars of home.

18:11.697 --> 18:13.820
I know they are following.

18:13.991 --> 18:18.202
But if an Earth ship,
why does he not attack?

18:21.331 --> 18:25.198
First study the enemy,
seek weakness.

18:25.377 --> 18:28.330
If I were their commander,
that is what I would do.

18:32.592 --> 18:35.130
My commander sent for Decius.

18:37.346 --> 18:39.339
A message was dispatched.

18:39.515 --> 18:43.133
- You've broken the rule of silence.
- Only in code, commander.

18:43.310 --> 18:45.184
To inform our Praetor
of this glorious mission.

18:45.354 --> 18:48.473
Your carelessness might have ended
this glorious mission.

18:50.317 --> 18:52.890
You are reduced two steps in rank.
Return to post.

19:01.411 --> 19:03.736
Take care, commander.

19:04.414 --> 19:06.073
He has friends.

19:06.249 --> 19:10.875
And friends of his kind mean power,
and power is danger.

19:11.253 --> 19:13.542
Danger and I are old companions.

19:13.714 --> 19:15.753
We've seen a hundred campaigns
together,

19:15.924 --> 19:17.917
and still I do not understand you.

19:19.470 --> 19:22.838
I think you do. No need to tell you what
happens the moment we reach home

19:23.015 --> 19:26.348
with proof of the Earthmen's
weakness. And we will have proof.

19:26.518 --> 19:28.676
The Earth commander will follow,
he must,

19:28.853 --> 19:31.640
and when he attacks,
we will destroy him.

19:31.898 --> 19:34.603
Our gift to the homeland,
another war.

19:34.984 --> 19:38.400
If we are the strong,
is this not the signal for war?

19:38.571 --> 19:40.528
Must it always be so?

19:40.698 --> 19:42.904
How many comrades
have we lost in this way?

19:43.075 --> 19:45.827
Our portion, commander...

19:46.996 --> 19:50.115
...is obedience.
- Obedience!

19:50.290 --> 19:51.785
Duty.

19:51.959 --> 19:54.117
Death and more death.

19:54.294 --> 19:57.248
Soon even enough
for the Praetor's taste.

20:00.383 --> 20:02.175
Centurion...

20:02.719 --> 20:07.215
...I find myself wishing for destruction
before we can return.

20:13.854 --> 20:15.313
Worry not.

20:15.481 --> 20:19.692
Like you, I am too well-trained
in my duty to permit it.

20:20.152 --> 20:22.477
Continue evasive manoeuvres.

20:22.821 --> 20:25.573
Now, back to the first course.

20:34.749 --> 20:36.658
They're turning, sir.
We're staying with them.

20:38.253 --> 20:40.162
Steady on 111, mark 14.

20:40.338 --> 20:43.920
Back on their original course, captain.
Toward the Neutral Zone.

20:53.017 --> 20:55.342
What's our position, navigator?

20:56.895 --> 21:00.015
We'll enter the Neutral Zone
in less than an hour, sir.

21:00.190 --> 21:03.357
Assuming, of course,
that we don't turn back.

21:04.861 --> 21:08.312
We now have aboard debris
from Outpost 4, captain.

21:09.866 --> 21:13.032
Bring it to the Briefing Room.
Are you ready, gentlemen?

21:23.337 --> 21:26.042
From the outpost's protective shield.

21:26.465 --> 21:28.208
Cast rodinium.

21:28.383 --> 21:32.595
This is the hardest substance
known to our science.

21:36.558 --> 21:39.891
The lab theorizes
an enveloping energy plasma,

21:40.061 --> 21:42.184
forcing an implosion.

21:42.522 --> 21:44.064
Comments?

21:45.400 --> 21:48.436
Obviously their weaponry
is superior to ours,

21:48.611 --> 21:51.316
and they have
a practical invisibility screen.

21:51.489 --> 21:52.864
You're discussing tactics.

21:53.032 --> 21:55.439
Do you realise
what this really comes down to?

21:55.618 --> 21:58.737
Millions and millions of lives
hanging on what this vessel does next.

21:58.912 --> 22:01.403
Or on what this vessel
fails to do, doctor.

22:01.582 --> 22:04.369
Yes, well, gentlemen, the question
still remains, can we engage them

22:04.543 --> 22:06.369
with a reasonable possibility
of victory?

22:06.545 --> 22:09.545
No question.
Their power is simple impulse.

22:09.714 --> 22:12.039
- Meaning we can outrun them.
- To be used in chasing them

22:12.217 --> 22:14.209
or retreating, sir.

22:14.385 --> 22:16.923
Go ahead, Mr. Stiles.
I called this session for opinions.

22:17.096 --> 22:19.552
- We have to attack immediately.
- Explain.

22:19.724 --> 22:21.551
They're still on our side
of the Neutral Zone.

22:21.726 --> 22:23.683
There would be no doubt
they broke the treaty.

22:23.853 --> 22:26.011
Attack? Without a visible target?

22:26.438 --> 22:28.396
- How do we aim our phasers?
- Aim with sensors.

22:28.565 --> 22:30.309
Not accurate,
but if we blanket them, we...

22:30.484 --> 22:32.560
And hope for a lucky shot
before they zero in on us?

22:32.736 --> 22:34.361
And if we don't?

22:34.529 --> 22:38.029
Once back, they'll report
that we saw their weapons and ran.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.322
And if they could report
that they destroyed us?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.533
These are Romulans!

22:42.704 --> 22:44.862
You run away from them,
and you guarantee war.

22:45.039 --> 22:48.159
They'll be back, not just one ship
but with everything they've got.

22:48.334 --> 22:51.370
You know that, Mr. Science Officer.
You're the expert in these people.

22:51.712 --> 22:54.084
But you've always left out
that one point. Why?

22:54.257 --> 22:56.130
I'm very interested in why.

22:58.677 --> 22:59.792
Sit down, mister.

23:08.103 --> 23:10.594
I agree. Attack.

23:13.108 --> 23:15.729
Are you suggesting
we fight to prevent a fight?

23:15.902 --> 23:17.480
Based on what?

23:17.654 --> 23:20.109
Memories of a war
over a century ago?

23:20.281 --> 23:23.448
On theories about a people
we've never even met face to face?

23:23.618 --> 23:24.946
We know what they look like.

23:25.119 --> 23:28.951
Yes, indeed we do, Mr. Stiles.
And if the Romulans are an offshoot

23:29.123 --> 23:31.828
of my Vulcan blood...
And I think this likely.

23:32.001 --> 23:34.124
- Then attack becomes
even more imperative.

23:34.294 --> 23:37.877
- War is never imperative, Mr. Spock.
- It is for them, doctor.

23:38.048 --> 23:41.583
Vulcan, like Earth, had its aggressive,
colonizing period.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.167
Savage, even by Earth standards.

23:44.346 --> 23:46.967
And if the Romulans
retained this martial philosophy,

23:47.140 --> 23:49.512
then weakness is something
we dare not show.

23:49.893 --> 23:52.134
Do you want a galactic war
on your conscience?

23:57.650 --> 23:59.477
- Captain to bridge.
- This is Uhura, captain.

23:59.652 --> 24:01.360
- What's our position?
- Course unchanged, sir.

24:01.529 --> 24:03.605
Estimating treaty boundary
in 21 minutes.

24:03.781 --> 24:05.820
Are you continuing
to broadcast tactical reports?

24:05.991 --> 24:08.031
- Affirmative, captain.
- And at this distance?

24:08.202 --> 24:09.482
Approximately three hours

24:09.661 --> 24:11.570
before receiving a reply
to our first message.

24:11.747 --> 24:15.447
Thank you, lieutenant.
Check our course ahead, Mr. Spock.

24:16.334 --> 24:19.335
A comet, magnitude 7, dead ahead.

24:19.504 --> 24:22.458
And the intruder
changing course toward it.

24:22.924 --> 24:26.791
- Comet Icarus 4. Composition?
- Quite ordinary.

24:26.969 --> 24:29.840
An ionized mass,
a trail of frozen vapour particles.

24:30.014 --> 24:33.714
And when an object passes through it,
even an invisible object...

24:34.018 --> 24:35.476
It leaves a visible trail.

24:37.062 --> 24:38.971
Our chance, gentlemen.

24:39.148 --> 24:41.899
Prepare to attack.
All hands battle stations.

24:46.363 --> 24:48.735
I hope we won't need
your services, Bones.

24:48.907 --> 24:52.607
Amen to that.
You're taking a big gamble, Jim.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.266
Battle status.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.351
All stations manned, captain.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.397
Phaser weapons energized,
set for proximity blast.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.109
Intruder now bearing directly
for comet's tail.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.524
Plot his exact point of entry,
Mr. Stiles.

25:36.077 --> 25:38.235
Computed. On the board, sir.

25:38.412 --> 25:41.448
The moment he begins entering
the comet's tail, he becomes visible.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.415
End run, gentlemen.

25:44.585 --> 25:48.285
We'll swing around the other side
and catch him at that moment.

25:48.630 --> 25:49.745
Acknowledged, captain.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.714
He's maintaining that bearing,
captain.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.208
Let's get him, Mr. Sulu.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.927
How pleasing to the eye it is.

26:02.143 --> 26:04.930
Behold a marvel in the darkness.

26:05.104 --> 26:07.642
You spoke of entrapment.

26:08.649 --> 26:12.978
Its many particles will obscure
their sensing device, Centurion.

26:13.612 --> 26:15.521
We enter it, commander.

26:21.578 --> 26:26.074
Once fully obscured, we will turn
suddenly back upon our adversary.

26:26.249 --> 26:27.827
At last, the screen is clear,
commander.

26:29.335 --> 26:31.743
- Clear?
- Our reflection no longer follows us.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.417
Escape manoeuvre one! Quickly!

26:51.273 --> 26:55.271
- We're losing sensor contact, captain.
- Steady as she goes.

26:55.444 --> 26:57.187
Phaser crews ready?

26:57.362 --> 27:00.612
- Phaser crew signal ready, sir.
- He'll only be visible for a moment.

27:02.033 --> 27:03.860
Stand by.

27:16.630 --> 27:18.208
Sir, nothing in...

27:18.382 --> 27:20.671
- At the last moment, he must...
- Must have guessed our move.

27:20.843 --> 27:23.512
- Hard to starboard, helm!
- Hard to starboard.

27:26.807 --> 27:29.132
He did exactly what I would've done.

27:30.352 --> 27:32.973
I won't underestimate him again.

27:33.229 --> 27:35.352
Now, fire blind. Lay down a pattern.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.397
Traverse pattern. All phasers fire.

27:37.567 --> 27:41.896
- Phaser one, fire.
- Phaser one, fire.

27:54.541 --> 27:57.412
- Phaser two, fire.
- Phaser two, fire.

28:20.274 --> 28:23.477
Divert all power to weapons.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.112
Phaser overload.
Control-circuit burnout.

28:45.423 --> 28:48.922
- It'll take time to correct, sir.
- Captain, are they surrendering?

28:56.892 --> 28:59.300
Full astern! Emergency warp speed!

29:05.734 --> 29:09.103
- Do we have emergency warp?
- Full power, sir. It's still overtaking us.

29:19.122 --> 29:23.119
If we can get one phaser working,
sir, one shot will detonate it.

29:23.292 --> 29:24.834
Navigation?

29:25.002 --> 29:27.327
Estimate it will overtake us
in two minutes, sir.

29:32.009 --> 29:34.500
- Phasers, Mr. Spock?
- Impossible, captain.

29:39.850 --> 29:42.969
Feed this to the space recorder
and jettison immediately.

29:44.687 --> 29:46.395
Captain, should I continue
log entry or..?

29:46.564 --> 29:48.189
Yeoman...

29:52.820 --> 29:56.189
- Affirmative, continue log entries.
- Yes, sir.

29:56.741 --> 29:58.199
Ten seconds to impact.

30:03.539 --> 30:06.456
Captain, it's dissipating, sir.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.701
It must have a range limit.

30:14.049 --> 30:18.378
Five, four, three,

30:18.553 --> 30:21.719
two, one, impact.

30:29.188 --> 30:30.563
Limited range.

30:42.284 --> 30:44.739
Phasers operational, captain.

30:47.997 --> 30:51.082
Intruder bearing 111, mark 14.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.240
Back to his old course.

30:54.087 --> 30:55.581
He may think we're destroyed,
captain.

30:55.755 --> 30:58.210
I wouldn't make that assumption.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.084
I don't think their captain will either.

31:01.510 --> 31:05.757
Intruder holding steady.
Course 111, mark 14.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.097
Same as before, Mr. Sulu.

31:18.693 --> 31:20.686
Stay with him.

31:32.289 --> 31:34.247
Commander, the reflection returns.

31:35.709 --> 31:37.868
- Activate our cloak.
- Commander, our fuel runs low.

31:38.045 --> 31:39.587
Quickly!

31:43.300 --> 31:44.675
The Earth vessel?

31:44.843 --> 31:47.381
- Impossible.
- It moves as we move.

31:50.140 --> 31:53.140
Its commander is not one
to repeat a mistake.

32:05.654 --> 32:07.564
We'll enter the Neutral Zone
in one minute, captain.

32:07.740 --> 32:10.361
- Do we violate the treaty, captain?
- They did, doctor.

32:10.534 --> 32:13.451
Once inside, they can claim
we did. A setup.

32:13.620 --> 32:15.827
They want war,
we furnish the provocation.

32:15.998 --> 32:18.667
We're still on our side, captain.

32:19.626 --> 32:23.789
Let's get them while we are.
Before we enter the Neutral Zone.

32:23.963 --> 32:25.506
Full ahead, Mr. Sulu,
maximum warp.

32:26.799 --> 32:27.962
Ahead, sir, maximum.

32:28.134 --> 32:30.590
- Phasers, stand by.
- Sir, at this distance?

32:33.222 --> 32:35.843
We know their Achilles' heel,
Mr. Stiles.

32:36.017 --> 32:37.427
Their weapon
takes all their energy.

32:37.601 --> 32:39.475
They must become visible
in order to launch it.

32:39.645 --> 32:42.765
A phaser hit at this distance
would be the wildest stroke of luck.

32:43.190 --> 32:44.898
I'm aware of that, Mr. Stiles.

32:45.067 --> 32:47.309
- Are phasers ready?
- Phasers show ready, sir.

32:50.197 --> 32:53.316
- Commander!
- Evasive action.

32:53.992 --> 32:55.023
The Earth ship again.

33:14.595 --> 33:16.338
Twenty seconds
to Neutral Zone, sir.

33:16.805 --> 33:18.679
Lieutenant Uhura...

33:19.224 --> 33:21.300
...inform Command Base.

33:22.269 --> 33:24.510
In my opinion, no option.

33:26.690 --> 33:29.227
On my responsibility...

33:29.734 --> 33:32.486
...we are proceeding
into the Neutral Zone.

33:36.741 --> 33:39.742
Steady as we go, Mr. Sulu.
Continue firing.

33:48.544 --> 33:50.916
Commander, they stay within range.

33:53.340 --> 33:56.625
- I will tend to the Centurion.
- No need.

33:56.802 --> 33:59.127
Centurion is dead.

33:59.304 --> 34:01.842
Why don't we fire, commander?

34:04.684 --> 34:06.143
No.

34:07.270 --> 34:12.014
No, he's shrewd,
this starship commander.

34:12.190 --> 34:15.025
He tries to make us waste energy.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.196
He has estimated we
have only enough...

34:25.786 --> 34:27.447
It is time.

34:27.621 --> 34:31.286
- All debris into disposal tubes.
- Yes, commander.

34:32.460 --> 34:35.295
The body of the Centurion too.

34:42.594 --> 34:44.801
Forgive me, my old friend...

34:45.348 --> 34:50.304
...but I must use all my experience
now to get home.

34:57.484 --> 34:59.311
Motion-sensor signal stopped.

34:59.986 --> 35:02.145
- Cease-fire.
- Debris scattering ahead, sir.

35:02.656 --> 35:04.114
- We've hit them.
- Mr. Spock?

35:04.282 --> 35:08.944
Vessel wreckage.
Metal moulds, conduit, plastiform...

35:09.120 --> 35:11.113
...and a body, captain. However...

35:14.041 --> 35:16.164
- However?
- An insufficient mass, sir.

35:17.211 --> 35:19.702
- What?
- Simple debris.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.336
Not a vessel, a trick.

35:22.508 --> 35:25.177
- Go to sensor probes.
- Nothing, sir.

35:25.344 --> 35:27.669
No motion out there at all.

35:29.348 --> 35:30.462
We've lost them, captain.

35:43.277 --> 35:47.357
Captain's log, stardate 1709.6.

35:47.532 --> 35:49.191
We are at the Neutral Zone.

35:49.367 --> 35:51.240
Have lost contact with the intruder.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.201
No reaction on our motion sensors,

35:53.370 --> 35:56.407
but believe the Romulan vessel
to be somewhere close by

35:56.582 --> 35:59.701
with all engines
and systems shut down.

35:59.877 --> 36:02.450
The Enterprise is also playing
the silent waiting game

36:02.629 --> 36:05.037
in hope of regaining contact.

36:05.215 --> 36:06.757
Captain.

36:07.467 --> 36:10.384
I must make further repairs on the
transfer coil. It's giving out again.

36:10.553 --> 36:13.887
All right, Mr. Spock. Work quietly.

36:23.149 --> 36:27.146
Now 20 full cycles, commander.
Still no sign.

36:30.739 --> 36:34.073
I say he's been fooled.
He must've gone on.

36:34.409 --> 36:39.071
He is there. Somewhere. I feel it.

36:39.748 --> 36:41.906
Captain's log, supplemental.

36:42.083 --> 36:45.333
Now motionless
for nine hours, 47 minutes.

36:55.429 --> 36:57.338
Can I get you something
from the galley, sir?

36:59.892 --> 37:01.635
Coffee, at least?

37:01.935 --> 37:03.643
Thank you, yeoman.

37:04.271 --> 37:06.263
Bring it to the bridge.
I'll be there in a moment.

37:06.440 --> 37:07.768
Yes, sir.

37:19.160 --> 37:22.860
I wish I were on a long
sea voyage somewhere.

37:23.581 --> 37:26.451
Not too much deck tennis,
no frantic dancing

37:26.626 --> 37:28.784
and no responsibility.

37:30.546 --> 37:32.123
Why me?

37:34.466 --> 37:36.708
I look around that bridge...

37:37.261 --> 37:40.795
...and I see the men waiting for me
to make the next move.

37:41.306 --> 37:42.337
And, Bones...

37:45.143 --> 37:46.554
...what if I'm wrong?

37:51.149 --> 37:54.315
- Captain...
- I don't really expect an answer.

37:55.319 --> 37:57.228
But I've got one.

37:57.989 --> 38:00.693
Something I seldom say to a...

38:01.117 --> 38:03.109
...customer, Jim.

38:04.245 --> 38:05.988
In this galaxy,

38:06.163 --> 38:11.999
there's a mathematical probability
of 3 million Earth-type planets.

38:12.544 --> 38:14.952
And in all of the universe,

38:15.130 --> 38:19.507
3 million million galaxies like this.

38:20.885 --> 38:22.759
And in all of that...

38:23.805 --> 38:25.678
...and perhaps more...

38:26.766 --> 38:29.008
...only one of each of us.

38:31.771 --> 38:34.890
Don't destroy the one named Kirk.

39:12.226 --> 39:14.135
- What?
- It's all right.

39:17.606 --> 39:18.637
It's all right.

39:19.608 --> 39:20.639
A signal, commander.

39:25.155 --> 39:28.405
We have him. Move toward him.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.032
Power on.

39:39.084 --> 39:41.622
Reverse course.
He'll try to slip under us.

39:41.795 --> 39:43.918
- Lateral power, sir.
- Coming around, sir.

39:44.089 --> 39:47.256
Phasers, fire.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.632
Phasers, fire.

40:04.192 --> 40:05.816
How, commander? How?

40:05.985 --> 40:10.232
He's a sorcerer, that one.
He reads the thoughts in my brain.

40:12.700 --> 40:16.483
Our fuel supply all but gone,
and he stays out of reach.

40:16.662 --> 40:20.161
We are beaten. Can it be true?

40:20.332 --> 40:23.914
The Praetor's finest
and proudest flagship, beaten!

40:26.796 --> 40:31.838
Perhaps we can yet save
your Praetor's pride for him.

40:32.010 --> 40:34.335
More debris into the tubes!
Decius,

40:34.512 --> 40:37.050
do we have some of the old-style
nuclear warheads aboard?

40:37.223 --> 40:39.050
Yes, commander,
but only for self-destruction.

40:39.225 --> 40:42.060
Place one in with the debris.
Proximity fuse.

40:42.228 --> 40:44.137
Yes, commander. At once.

40:49.193 --> 40:51.066
More wreckage, sir,
scattering across our path.

40:51.236 --> 40:53.644
- Cease-fire.
- Debris on our scanners.

40:53.822 --> 40:56.609
- Analysis, quickly.
- Same type as before, sir.

40:57.325 --> 41:01.157
Except one metal-cased object.

41:01.329 --> 41:02.408
Helm, hard over.

41:02.580 --> 41:04.905
- Phasers, fire. Point-blank.
- Phasers, fire!

41:18.220 --> 41:21.221
Glorious. Glorious!

41:24.434 --> 41:26.343
Now we go home.

41:29.606 --> 41:31.764
They are at our mercy.

41:32.859 --> 41:34.437
Commander...

41:35.153 --> 41:37.608
...I remind you of your duty.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.077
- Captain to Sickbay.
- McCoy here.

41:46.247 --> 41:49.082
- Casualties?
- Twenty-two so far.

41:49.250 --> 41:53.164
Mainly radiation burns,
mostly from the ship's outer areas.

41:53.337 --> 41:55.080
Could've been
much, much worse, captain.

41:55.255 --> 41:56.880
Thank you, doctor.

42:01.720 --> 42:06.049
- Report, Mr. Spock.
- Nuclear device of some kind, sir.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.422
Our phasers detonated it

42:07.600 --> 42:10.138
- less than 100 metres away.
- Ship damage?

42:10.311 --> 42:12.553
Mainly overloads
and circuit burnouts.

42:12.939 --> 42:15.560
- Weapons status.
- Only the Forward Phaser Room.

42:15.733 --> 42:17.642
- Fully operable, Scotty?
- Yes, sir.

42:17.818 --> 42:19.692
But Specialist Tomlinson
is manning it alone.

42:19.862 --> 42:21.938
No standby crew available.

42:22.114 --> 42:25.031
Sir, my first assignment
was in Weapons Control.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.987
Go. Lieutenant Uhura,
take over navigation.

42:28.161 --> 42:29.821
Yes, captain.

42:42.759 --> 42:44.087
We have engine power now,
captain,

42:44.260 --> 42:45.838
if you'd like to move off,
make repairs.

42:46.012 --> 42:47.422
No, no.

42:48.055 --> 42:52.516
Maybe we can pull them back
to our side of the Neutral Zone.

42:52.810 --> 42:54.601
Hold our position.

42:55.062 --> 42:56.521
Play dead.

43:03.403 --> 43:05.443
Still no sign of movement.

43:05.614 --> 43:09.611
We have damaged ourselves.
Our fuel reserve is gone.

43:11.995 --> 43:16.324
And it is our duty
to crush the Praetor's enemies.

43:17.750 --> 43:19.956
I do not trust their captain.

43:20.127 --> 43:23.792
We are in the Neutral Zone.
They will not enter.

43:27.635 --> 43:32.261
If you refuse, permit me the glory
of the kill, commander.

43:37.686 --> 43:39.974
We will attack...

43:40.146 --> 43:42.518
...but on my order.

43:55.619 --> 43:57.161
Damage reports, Mr. Stiles.

43:58.122 --> 44:00.410
- Negative.
- Will you require any assistance here?

44:04.503 --> 44:07.587
This time, we'll handle things
without your help, Vulcan.

44:19.809 --> 44:21.552
Tomlinson...

44:32.071 --> 44:33.862
Enemy vessel becoming visible, sir.

44:34.323 --> 44:37.193
Forward phasers, stand by.

44:41.538 --> 44:42.997
Fire.

44:44.207 --> 44:45.701
Fire!

44:48.545 --> 44:49.790
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

44:51.047 --> 44:55.127
Fire! Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

44:55.551 --> 44:56.630
Fire!

44:57.053 --> 44:59.722
Stiles, can you hear me? Fire!

45:01.265 --> 45:02.843
Stiles!

45:19.949 --> 45:22.701
They're firing at us!

45:32.962 --> 45:36.413
Mr. Sulu, prepare to move in
on the Romulan vessel.

45:36.924 --> 45:38.916
Ship-to-ship, Uhura.

45:39.426 --> 45:42.095
- Put this on the screen.
- Hailing frequencies open, sir.

46:04.575 --> 46:06.153
Captain...

46:06.785 --> 46:09.952
...standing by to beam
your survivors aboard our ship.

46:10.122 --> 46:11.402
Prepare to abandon your vessel.

46:13.292 --> 46:14.620
No.

46:15.252 --> 46:17.956
No, it is not our way.

46:19.506 --> 46:24.748
I regret that we meet in this way.

46:25.470 --> 46:28.305
You and I are of a kind.

46:28.890 --> 46:31.381
In a different reality

46:31.684 --> 46:33.760
I could've called you "friend."

46:34.312 --> 46:36.269
What purpose will it serve to die?

46:37.982 --> 46:41.267
We are creatures of duty, captain.

46:41.944 --> 46:44.482
I have lived my life by it.

46:46.114 --> 46:51.072
Just one more duty to perform.

47:18.729 --> 47:21.220
- You all right, Mr. Spock?
- Very well. Thank you, captain.

47:21.398 --> 47:23.022
- And you, Mr. Stiles?
- I'm alive, sir.

47:23.191 --> 47:24.983
But I wouldn't be.

47:25.151 --> 47:28.188
Mr. Spock, he pulled me out
of the Phaser Room.

47:28.863 --> 47:32.030
Saved my life.
He risked his life, and after l...

47:32.200 --> 47:35.533
I saved a trained navigator
so that he could return to duty.

47:35.703 --> 47:38.159
I am capable of no other feelings
in such matters.

47:41.167 --> 47:44.701
- How many men did we lose, Bones?
- Only one.

47:45.212 --> 47:48.830
Tomlinson, the boy who
was gonna get married this morning.

47:49.258 --> 47:50.966
His fiancée is at the chapel now.

47:56.681 --> 47:59.219
We finally received an answer
from Command Base, sir.

47:59.392 --> 48:02.393
They say they'll support
whatever decision you have to make.

48:47.438 --> 48:48.718
It never makes any sense.

48:52.776 --> 48:54.935
We both have to know
that there was a reason.

49:01.785 --> 49:03.113
I'm all right.
