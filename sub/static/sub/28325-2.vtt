00:25.922 --> 00:29.248
Julia James. I'm here for the meeting.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.138
They're not quite ready for you.

00:31.234 --> 00:32.417
Do you have a bathroom?

00:32.454 --> 00:33.804
I just want to freshen up a bit.

00:33.896 --> 00:37.064
Yeah, right over here.
But, girl, you look good.

00:43.782 --> 00:46.017
Shit.

00:49.928 --> 00:51.478
Shit.

00:57.753 --> 01:00.370
They're ready... for you...

01:00.818 --> 01:03.838
Who's the most stylish woman
in the office about my size?

01:03.989 --> 01:06.048
- Chantal, why...
- I need you to go to Chantal.

01:06.085 --> 01:07.405
Tell her there's a woman
in the bathroom

01:07.441 --> 01:09.639
who will give her $200 cash
for her top.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.236
Come on! I need your help.

01:11.313 --> 01:13.268
I'm about to go into my tryouts
for the big leagues.

01:13.305 --> 01:15.063
If I show up like a girl
from Morristown

01:15.100 --> 01:16.441
who got nervous and pitted out,

01:16.478 --> 01:18.210
it's over before I even open my mouth.

01:18.361 --> 01:19.503
Please.

01:19.654 --> 01:21.529
Give her the money.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.290
You don't like what I'm wearing?

01:23.575 --> 01:25.242
I just think we have
different taste levels,

01:25.417 --> 01:27.358
but it looks great on you.

01:28.597 --> 01:30.138
Mr. Benjamin, you and I actually

01:30.175 --> 01:31.681
have something in common.

01:32.016 --> 01:34.700
We're both owners, and while Morristown

01:34.737 --> 01:36.711
may be a different market
than Tampa Bay,

01:36.730 --> 01:38.174
we face the same problem...

01:38.265 --> 01:40.004
baseball is dying.

01:41.106 --> 01:42.350
You've seen the demographics.

01:42.400 --> 01:45.382
Anyone under the age of 20
would rather watch e-sports

01:45.731 --> 01:47.032
than a baseball game.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.241
But I was able to increase attendance

01:49.278 --> 01:52.810
in Scranton Wilkes-Barre by 60%. How?

01:53.606 --> 01:56.986
'Cause I know there's one
inescapable fact about baseball.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.943
It's fun to go see a game.

02:00.019 --> 02:02.253
Maybe boring as shit to watch on TV,

02:02.290 --> 02:03.609
fade into the background on the radio,

02:03.646 --> 02:05.433
but in person...

02:06.617 --> 02:09.291
it's like the goddamn circus
came to town.

02:10.287 --> 02:13.080
Except without all
the elephant torture.

02:15.785 --> 02:17.001
What's your proposal?

02:17.086 --> 02:19.020
Pick your worst
spring training home date,

02:19.057 --> 02:21.240
the one you know right now
will be impossible to draw.

02:21.352 --> 02:23.108
Allow me to run a promotion on it.

02:23.369 --> 02:24.943
I guarantee it'll sell out,

02:25.095 --> 02:28.187
because even with the
obstacles Tampa Bay faces,

02:28.893 --> 02:31.155
a shrinking fan base, a bad team,

02:31.192 --> 02:32.560
the gator incident of '09...

02:32.597 --> 02:35.439
Hey, that man still swears
it was consensual.

02:37.068 --> 02:39.515
I know how to get people
to come to a baseball game.

02:39.956 --> 02:41.276
And once I prove it,

02:41.335 --> 02:43.062
you'll want to hire my
consulting company,

02:43.099 --> 02:46.214
Julia James Promotions,
on some regular season dates.

02:47.064 --> 02:49.398
Wednesday, March 13.

02:49.625 --> 02:51.866
It's a 10:00 a.m. start time
due to a rodeo

02:51.903 --> 02:54.047
that's taking place in the parking lot.

02:54.119 --> 02:56.544
So the whole place'll smell
like cow shit.

02:56.780 --> 02:58.390
How's that sound to you?

02:58.532 --> 03:00.423
Like perfection.

03:01.187 --> 03:02.928
Who we playing?

03:03.201 --> 03:04.816
Oakland.

03:05.201 --> 03:06.410
Great.

03:10.588 --> 03:12.939
I don't really believe in
fate, or destiny,

03:12.976 --> 03:14.159
or good things happening,

03:14.310 --> 03:16.713
but the fact that Jules'
major league debut

03:16.801 --> 03:18.312
is the same game that we're calling...

03:18.372 --> 03:20.875
- I mean, what are the odds?
- Pretty good, considering

03:20.912 --> 03:22.073
you're both starting at the bottom

03:22.109 --> 03:24.105
for the two worst
franchises in baseball.

03:24.142 --> 03:25.351
Well, thank you, Gabby.

03:25.388 --> 03:27.509
You are the wind above my wings.

03:27.996 --> 03:30.281
So what's going on with you two?

03:30.318 --> 03:32.217
You getting back together, or...

03:32.300 --> 03:33.667
I don't know. I mean,

03:33.738 --> 03:35.654
one scenario that could play itself out

03:35.691 --> 03:37.646
is we start with one to two
phone calls a week

03:37.683 --> 03:39.254
and the occasional brunch.

03:39.358 --> 03:42.046
On a lark, we get a timeshare
together in Ojai

03:42.083 --> 03:43.157
with some mutual friends,

03:43.194 --> 03:45.086
and, no, that's when
the intimacy returns.

03:45.123 --> 03:47.688
With a soupÃ§on of sexual tension

03:47.725 --> 03:49.069
thrown into the broth there.

03:49.106 --> 03:50.225
In three to eight years,

03:50.262 --> 03:51.955
when I finally do get my shit together,

03:51.992 --> 03:53.567
we marry at the Ojai house

03:53.604 --> 03:55.596
which is where it all began
for us, really.

03:55.668 --> 03:57.146
Our rescue dog, Satchel,

03:57.183 --> 03:59.279
'cause we're not exactly sure
how old he is,

03:59.339 --> 04:01.038
he's gonna be the ring bearer.

04:01.229 --> 04:02.848
So you're playing it cool. That's good.

04:03.110 --> 04:05.054
That's our story, but what about you?

04:05.091 --> 04:06.774
Are you seeing anybody?

04:06.926 --> 04:09.384
Uh, I'm married, actually,
to my wife, Gayle.

04:09.504 --> 04:11.189
No wonder we get along so well.

04:11.226 --> 04:13.580
I'm one of those straight men
who has always preferred

04:13.617 --> 04:14.850
the company of lesbians.

04:14.895 --> 04:16.543
Oh, you mean like a "Dyke Mike"?

04:16.579 --> 04:18.358
- Yeah, exactly.
- No, I just made that up.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.716
What you're describing does not exist.

04:19.752 --> 04:21.523
Now wait, check out my bona fides here.

04:21.634 --> 04:23.675
My sister Jean
just came out as a lesbian.

04:23.712 --> 04:25.505
She's one of my best friends.

04:25.585 --> 04:27.626
I've seen all six seasons
of the "L Word."

04:27.663 --> 04:29.721
God, I'm such a Bette.

04:29.807 --> 04:31.761
And, oh, Melissa Etheridge and I,

04:31.798 --> 04:34.059
we invented our own strain of
weed three years ago.

04:34.096 --> 04:36.700
- We called it O.G. Bush.
- I don't get it.

04:36.737 --> 04:38.464
- See, 'cause it rhymes with kush.
- Yeah.

04:38.501 --> 04:39.718
- No, I get it. Listen,
- Oh. Oh.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.520
I don't like to discuss
my sexuality at work,

04:41.557 --> 04:43.600
'cause all it does is embolden
straight white guys

04:43.637 --> 04:45.371
to ask me a bunch of stupid,
personal questions.

04:45.408 --> 04:46.928
- Just... one question...
- Nope. Nope. Nope.

04:46.964 --> 04:48.649
If you ask me who leads when
we dance, I swear to God.

04:48.686 --> 04:50.902
No, my question is
how do lesbians always

04:50.939 --> 04:52.776
remain such good friends
with their exes?

04:52.813 --> 04:55.171
- That's a stereotype.
- Is it though?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.569
May I say that you look
very nice today.

04:57.766 --> 04:59.959
And I... no, I mean that
in whatever way is appropriate

04:59.996 --> 05:01.246
to this current...

05:01.283 --> 05:02.470
Thank you.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.235
Do you mind if I drink in front of you?

05:04.272 --> 05:06.525
If it's a trigger,
I can put it in a paper bag

05:06.562 --> 05:08.086
or just take nips in the bathroom.

05:08.123 --> 05:10.065
That's very considerate,
but, no, I don't mind

05:10.102 --> 05:11.268
if people drink in front of me.

05:11.402 --> 05:13.242
No, my only triggers are dive bars

05:13.279 --> 05:14.928
and the movies of Christopher Nolan.

05:15.130 --> 05:17.722
That's right.
You threw a whiskey bottle

05:17.742 --> 05:19.721
- at my TV during...
- "Interstellar."

05:19.758 --> 05:22.574
I mean, I just want to be told
the story of the goddamn movie.

05:22.611 --> 05:23.873
I don't want to get taught a lesson

05:23.910 --> 05:25.750
in how to solve the puzzle
of what the hell I'm watching.

05:25.954 --> 05:28.678
Could I get a pint glass of
Chardonnay on the rocks?

05:28.715 --> 05:30.376
I know you don't do that,

05:30.413 --> 05:32.093
but really that just means
you haven't done it yet,

05:32.129 --> 05:33.105
'cause it's simple.

05:33.142 --> 05:35.312
You fill a pint glass full of ice,

05:35.349 --> 05:38.459
then charge me for your finest
bottle of Chardonnay,

05:38.496 --> 05:41.487
pour that bottle into the glass
till it hits the brim.

05:41.524 --> 05:43.288
Then keep the bottle handy,
'cause I need a buzz

05:43.325 --> 05:45.186
to make it through this lunch.

05:45.883 --> 05:47.903
I'm gonna make it worth your while.

05:51.350 --> 05:52.608
Wow.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.185
Oh, hey, I like Jules
with money and power,

05:55.337 --> 05:56.612
and I think the rest of the world...

05:56.649 --> 05:59.000
- I'm dating someone.
- I'm sorry?

05:59.266 --> 06:02.547
I say I'm seeing someone.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.069
Oh.

06:04.221 --> 06:05.642
Okay.

06:05.731 --> 06:07.048
Of course, you're great.

06:07.085 --> 06:08.696
I'm sure you met somebody great.

06:08.733 --> 06:10.083
- It makes sense...
- Someone you know.

06:10.173 --> 06:12.027
Really? Okay.

06:12.173 --> 06:15.295
Listen, new Jim, totally fine with it.

06:15.466 --> 06:16.954
We work in the same field.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.348
I mean, it was inevitable, right?

06:18.385 --> 06:20.828
It'd be weird if
I didn't know this, uh...

06:22.400 --> 06:25.141
- acquaintance?
- It's a good friend of yours.

06:25.670 --> 06:30.084
Okay, that narrows it down
to zero, Jules.

06:30.121 --> 06:31.669
No, I don't have any good friends.

06:31.706 --> 06:34.152
Unless you're gonna tell me
you're dating George Brett.

06:47.508 --> 06:49.164
I'm gonna need a top off.

06:49.411 --> 06:51.353
I'm dating George Brett.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.300
Jules, seriously?

06:54.388 --> 06:56.913
'Cause he's not a good friend,
he's my one friend.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.072
He's the only person
that sends me a birthday card.

06:59.109 --> 07:01.603
I mean, he's my goddamn
emergency contact.

07:01.666 --> 07:03.535
I know. That's how we met.

07:03.664 --> 07:06.194
He was used to getting
calls from hospitals

07:06.231 --> 07:07.526
and brothels around the world,

07:07.563 --> 07:09.062
and then you disappeared
for a whole year.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.340
He was worried. We all were.

07:11.403 --> 07:14.338
He reached out, and then we hit it off.

07:14.549 --> 07:17.601
Oh, so, I kind of
brought you guys together.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.875
- All right.
- In a way.

07:18.912 --> 07:20.828
- That's romantic.
- And you know I always

07:20.865 --> 07:23.122
had a crush on
Crocodile Dundee growing up.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.603
Yeah, well, George
is very Paul Hogan-esque.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.247
- Give you that.
- I had to tell you,

07:29.284 --> 07:31.503
'cause it's really serious.

07:31.540 --> 07:32.982
We're moving in together.

07:33.674 --> 07:35.605
Well, now that's surprising, Jules,

07:35.642 --> 07:36.954
considering that you never

07:36.991 --> 07:38.406
forgave me for leaving Morristown...

07:38.443 --> 07:40.372
George is moving to Morristown.

07:41.126 --> 07:44.202
Oh, get out of here. Come on.

07:44.324 --> 07:46.435
- Yeah.
- Okay,

07:46.472 --> 07:50.425
um, I need a little time with
this, but, um...

07:50.665 --> 07:52.969
- There's more.
- Oh, really?

07:53.324 --> 07:55.102
You're not even gonna
do me the courtesy

07:55.139 --> 07:56.326
of stabbing in the back?

07:56.363 --> 07:57.883
You're just gonna look me
straight in the face

07:57.919 --> 07:59.253
as you plunge the knife in, huh?

07:59.290 --> 08:02.071
It's not a knife, it's just my life,

08:02.147 --> 08:03.791
but, okay, I'll drop it.

08:04.664 --> 08:06.280
Thanks.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.229
What is it? What?

08:11.328 --> 08:13.585
He's up for a studio job
with Bob Costas

08:13.622 --> 08:15.450
on the MLB network.

08:16.115 --> 08:17.668
- Okay.
- So I figured,

08:17.705 --> 08:18.937
since you know Costas...

08:18.993 --> 08:20.455
I haven't spoken to Costas
since he got me

08:20.492 --> 08:22.296
cut out of "Ken Burns's
Baseball Documentary."

08:22.333 --> 08:24.650
Yeah, I know all about your interview.

08:24.687 --> 08:26.510
Yeah, an interview
which will never be seen

08:26.547 --> 08:28.913
in the definitive,
visual history of the game

08:28.933 --> 08:31.767
all because Bob Costas is
the world's smallest asshole.

08:31.918 --> 08:34.222
You... no, you want me to eat
a cold plate of shit

08:34.259 --> 08:36.719
and call him up,
all to get your new boyfriend,

08:36.756 --> 08:39.020
my best friend, a job?

08:39.222 --> 08:40.888
Never mind.

08:41.964 --> 08:43.102
I don't know why I even thought...

08:43.139 --> 08:44.706
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna do it.

08:44.743 --> 08:45.989
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

08:46.063 --> 08:48.221
- Why?
- Because the old Jim

08:48.258 --> 08:49.616
would have used this as an excuse

08:49.653 --> 08:51.326
to go on a bender and try to catch

08:51.363 --> 08:53.990
that super gonorrhea with both hands.

08:54.929 --> 08:56.974
But I'm new Jim.

08:59.936 --> 09:02.718
<i>Thank you for supporting
Tampa baseball.</i>

09:02.755 --> 09:04.259
<i>During the game...</i>

09:05.015 --> 09:06.695
<i>You know, the only things
I know about George Brett</i>

09:06.731 --> 09:09.334
are he is a hall-of-famer,
and, more impressively,

09:09.371 --> 09:10.956
Lorde wrote her song "Royals"
about him.

09:10.993 --> 09:12.193
Thank you for that fun fact, Gabby.

09:12.229 --> 09:14.397
You know what really
chaps my ass though?

09:14.434 --> 09:16.692
She had the balls, she had the cajones

09:16.729 --> 09:18.624
to ask me to do her a favor

09:18.733 --> 09:20.818
by calling up Bob Costas on the phone.

09:20.902 --> 09:22.494
So what's the big deal?

09:22.581 --> 09:24.310
The year's 1993, okay?

09:24.347 --> 09:27.292
I'm walking into an interview
as Costas is walking out.

09:27.329 --> 09:28.525
I say, "Hey, Bob",

09:28.562 --> 09:30.958
what kind of stuff does
Ken Burns want to know?"

09:31.053 --> 09:33.791
He says, "Oh, he's looking
for all the X-rated details"

09:33.852 --> 09:35.532
that nobody ever shares on camera."

09:35.569 --> 09:37.707
So I sit down in front of Ken Burns

09:37.826 --> 09:40.367
and I launch myself into this graphic

09:40.404 --> 09:43.526
and detailed history
of beaver shooting.

09:43.563 --> 09:46.303
- I don't know what that is.
- Most of baseball history,

09:46.340 --> 09:48.408
the players like
to sneak underneath the stands

09:48.445 --> 09:50.620
and try to find the women who
weren't wearing any underwear.

09:50.657 --> 09:51.859
It's kind of like bird watching,

09:51.896 --> 09:53.396
except, you know, for labias.

09:53.513 --> 09:55.509
So that's what you thought
Ken Burns wanted to hear?

09:55.570 --> 09:57.974
Just a tradition of low-grade
sexual assault?

09:58.011 --> 09:59.347
The point of that story was not really

09:59.384 --> 10:01.417
how Ken Burns' funereal tone

10:01.481 --> 10:03.965
sands over the profane aspects
of American history.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.338
The point is Bob Costas fucked me

10:06.411 --> 10:08.887
and didn't even have the
decency to finger my ass first.

10:08.924 --> 10:10.290
Wait, don't you always brag

10:10.327 --> 10:12.360
that you gave Bob Costas
pink eye in Sochi?

10:12.397 --> 10:14.395
Yeah, I definitely did that.

10:14.446 --> 10:16.449
So then you're even. Feud over.

10:16.486 --> 10:18.240
Now you can go help
the woman's who's heart

10:18.277 --> 10:20.518
I assume you broke over and over.

10:20.763 --> 10:21.957
It was just twice.

10:21.994 --> 10:25.236
All right, we're on in three,
two, one...

10:25.371 --> 10:27.808
Welcome, everybody,
to Port Charlotte, Florida,

10:27.845 --> 10:30.491
home today not only
of spring training baseball

10:30.528 --> 10:34.287
but to the 2019 South Eastern
Rodeo semifinals.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.044
<i>And although it's only 10:00 a.m.,</i>

10:36.081 --> 10:38.915
the broiling sun is reminding
us all that livestock

10:38.952 --> 10:41.983
are in fact defecating in very
large numbers out there.

10:42.055 --> 10:44.240
Smells so bad it
actually hurts my feelings.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.507
How about you, Gabby?

10:45.544 --> 10:46.840
<i>Yeah, I don't know what's worse, Jim.</i>

10:46.877 --> 10:49.302
<i>That I can taste it or that
I've gotten used to the taste.</i>

10:49.454 --> 10:52.097
<i>Oh, definitely the latter,
but what's remarkable</i>

10:52.134 --> 10:54.673
<i>is that this stadium slash
animal toilet</i>

10:54.710 --> 10:57.043
<i>is somehow packed full of fans.</i>

10:57.203 --> 10:58.599
Oh!

10:58.704 --> 11:00.326
Wow.

11:01.112 --> 11:05.047
We haven't had a sellout here
in, uh... ever.

11:05.211 --> 11:07.988
Never had a doubt.

11:08.028 --> 11:09.728
What's with all the phones?

11:10.134 --> 11:13.075
Augmented reality.
Future of live entertainment.

11:13.112 --> 11:14.874
<i>A composite between the real world</i>

11:14.911 --> 11:16.104
<i>and the digital world.</i>

11:16.176 --> 11:17.655
<i>Right now they're all playing a game</i>

11:17.692 --> 11:19.176
called "Beasts of Bedlam."

11:19.213 --> 11:22.689
They're using their phones
to battle and capture monsters.

11:22.726 --> 11:25.041
So I partnered with the creators

11:25.078 --> 11:28.722
and made the stadium
a realm of rare creatures.

11:28.826 --> 11:31.010
Video games on your phone.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.345
My fat grandson plays those
all the time,

11:33.382 --> 11:35.857
but what's that have
to do with baseball?

11:35.929 --> 11:38.185
You promised me fans for life.

11:38.222 --> 11:39.674
This...

11:39.975 --> 11:41.252
this is a gimmick.

11:41.343 --> 11:44.190
Top of the seventh, Ramirez
on to pitch now for Tampa Bay

11:44.227 --> 11:46.069
in what has been
a very strange ball game.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.633
<i>Most of the crowd has been playing</i>

11:47.670 --> 11:49.512
<i>some weird game on their phone.</i>

11:49.596 --> 11:50.991
Holy shit!

11:51.074 --> 11:53.080
A new character was just released.

11:53.117 --> 11:54.851
It's the baseball throwing guy.

11:54.963 --> 11:57.305
On the field. On the hill.

11:57.680 --> 11:58.929
Ramirez!

12:03.900 --> 12:05.938
If he strikes out the next batter,

12:05.990 --> 12:08.622
his character will buff 20%

12:08.704 --> 12:11.171
and become the most powerful monster

12:11.208 --> 12:12.737
in the M-O-B-A.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.531
- Is that the MOBA?
- Yep.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.177
The MOBA. My goodness,

12:16.610 --> 12:18.177
<i>this is making me long for the days</i>

12:18.214 --> 12:19.539
<i>when I did commercial reads</i>

12:19.576 --> 12:21.818
<i>for the smooth taste
of extra tar cigarettes.</i>

12:21.855 --> 12:23.471
<i>Gabby, can you please tell me</i>

12:23.508 --> 12:25.216
what the heck it is that I just read.

12:25.253 --> 12:26.570
If Ramirez strikes out Copeland,

12:26.607 --> 12:28.112
basically I'll never lose a game

12:28.149 --> 12:29.999
to my nieces and nephews again.

12:30.355 --> 12:32.243
That didn't clear anything up.

12:33.065 --> 12:34.788
<i>Well, there's strike two.</i>

12:34.844 --> 12:36.660
Why are they all going crazy?

12:36.963 --> 12:39.137
<i>'Cause we just made the game
real to them.</i>

12:39.341 --> 12:41.972
This'll be their favorite
memory of favorite their thing,

12:42.009 --> 12:43.474
and they'll be forever drawn to Tampa

12:43.493 --> 12:45.425
to see if we're as fun
as they remember.

12:47.877 --> 12:49.929
Nostalgia. <i>Swing, and strike three!</i>

12:49.966 --> 12:52.400
It's the most powerful drug there is.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.742
Come by tomorrow.

12:56.972 --> 12:59.517
I'll give you all the regular
season dates I can.

12:59.554 --> 13:01.987
Tomorrow doesn't work for me.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.422
- Really?
- I'm kidding.

13:03.459 --> 13:06.765
- I was just...
- Ah. Ah...

13:06.840 --> 13:09.158
I like money. I'll be there.

13:13.830 --> 13:16.926
Well, you did it, Jules.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.589
- I did.
- You did.

13:18.626 --> 13:21.794
Have you called George yet?
Tell him the good news?

13:22.298 --> 13:24.055
Yup.

13:24.451 --> 13:26.533
He doesn't really get the whole
video game thing.

13:26.570 --> 13:28.769
- I mean, he's from a different era.
- Yeah.

13:29.008 --> 13:31.029
I had to explain to him who Lorde is.

13:31.108 --> 13:33.291
You know that he inspired her
to write the song "Royals"?

13:33.328 --> 13:35.146
I heard that. That's very cool.

13:35.237 --> 13:36.981
You know, Jules,
what you did here today,

13:37.092 --> 13:39.334
that's one of the most amazing
things I've ever seen,

13:39.419 --> 13:42.498
and I once saw a triple play
end a ball game. Ha.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.389
Thank you.

13:44.652 --> 13:45.996
Hope you and George go out

13:46.033 --> 13:48.384
and just get drunk
as two skunks tonight.

13:48.557 --> 13:50.148
Nuh-uh.

13:50.685 --> 13:52.042
No, no.

13:53.045 --> 13:54.759
George is sober.

13:55.198 --> 13:56.972
Sober as in serious,

13:57.049 --> 13:59.495
like in how you would describe
a hardened pilgrim woman

13:59.532 --> 14:02.281
named Goodie who watched
all of her children die?

14:02.898 --> 14:05.743
No, I mean, he...

14:05.844 --> 14:08.787
stopped drinking around
the same time you did.

14:11.233 --> 14:12.764
Will you excuse me for just a minute?

14:12.801 --> 14:14.219
Yeah.

14:32.552 --> 14:34.628
Everything okay?

14:35.588 --> 14:37.346
Hooooow dare you!

14:37.620 --> 14:40.454
How dare you date someone sober
who isn't me!

14:40.491 --> 14:42.563
All this time I thought
you were just too damaged

14:42.600 --> 14:43.726
to handle my sobriety,

14:43.763 --> 14:45.734
but now I see I was just
too young for you.

14:45.771 --> 14:47.737
Turns out you wanted to fuck your dad.

14:47.774 --> 14:49.976
- Okay, we're done.
- Sorry, Jules, well...

14:50.013 --> 14:51.338
I'm sorry. Jules.

14:51.604 --> 14:53.671
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

14:54.571 --> 14:56.745
Look, I said some
unforgivable things to you.

14:56.794 --> 14:59.257
Now you say some unforgivable
things to me... we'll be fine.

14:59.294 --> 15:00.638
I don't want to say horrible
things to you.

15:00.674 --> 15:01.835
I don't want to say anything to you.

15:01.872 --> 15:03.072
Great, just keep talking about how

15:03.108 --> 15:04.563
you don't want to talk to me anymore.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.003
Holy shit.

15:06.241 --> 15:07.784
Look, can we at least talk...

15:07.821 --> 15:09.284
Oh, my God. Can we talk about

15:09.321 --> 15:10.930
what's going on with this loose pig?

15:11.081 --> 15:12.673
I mean, the rodeo left hours ago.

15:13.137 --> 15:15.992
Did it escape? Was it abandoned?

15:16.109 --> 15:17.860
Why is it wearing a pirate hat?

15:17.923 --> 15:20.274
No, seriously, I really feel
like if ever there were

15:20.311 --> 15:21.695
a worthy topic of conversation...

15:21.732 --> 15:23.308
If I broke up with George right now,

15:23.345 --> 15:25.748
would you even be capable of
having a relationship?

15:26.253 --> 15:28.795
Not at this point in my sobriety, no,

15:28.832 --> 15:30.920
but I did just get
a turtle though, so...

15:30.957 --> 15:33.841
So you want me to just

15:34.012 --> 15:36.012
keep putting my life on hold
in perpetuity

15:36.052 --> 15:37.360
while you get your shit together?

15:37.397 --> 15:39.230
I mean, how would that even work?

15:39.309 --> 15:42.201
Well, now, one scenario
that could play out

15:42.297 --> 15:44.615
is we start with one to two
phone calls a week.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.644
One to two phone calls a week?

15:46.681 --> 15:49.504
Are you insane? We didn't work out!

15:49.766 --> 15:52.638
You needed to get out
and pursue your dreams,

15:52.675 --> 15:55.176
and I had to stay
and try to salvage mine.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.474
I'm glad you're trying to get healthy,

15:57.511 --> 15:59.011
but let me be clear.

15:59.204 --> 16:01.637
We're never getting back together.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.230
Ever!

16:04.671 --> 16:05.813
Move the pig.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.738
Well...

16:08.348 --> 16:11.866
Holy shit, Jules, the pig's
wearing a different hat.

16:12.015 --> 16:13.841
Seriously, that's either
a different pig

16:13.878 --> 16:15.981
or he made a wardrobe change
all on his own.

16:16.018 --> 16:18.186
I mean, Jesus Christ. I really feel

16:18.223 --> 16:19.913
that we should put
our differences aside

16:19.950 --> 16:21.712
and focus on this pig situation.

16:21.749 --> 16:24.693
Move the pig, or I'm gonna run it over.

16:24.844 --> 16:25.910
Understood. All right.

16:25.947 --> 16:28.749
All right, Mr. Pig. Soo-ee.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.000
Move along.

16:30.151 --> 16:31.927
Hoo-ahh!

16:32.346 --> 16:34.162
Jules, please don't leave.

16:34.239 --> 16:35.818
I was ready to kill the magical pig.

16:35.855 --> 16:37.124
What do you think I'll do to you?

16:37.161 --> 16:39.468
I need you in my life, okay?
I need to at least know

16:39.505 --> 16:42.320
that if I called you someday
you'd answer the phone.

16:42.608 --> 16:44.732
What do I have to do to make
this up to you?

16:46.116 --> 16:48.722
George Brett is great,
but so are a lot of people.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.053
This is a big ask.

16:50.130 --> 16:51.982
Yeah, but don't you think
you kind of owe me

16:52.045 --> 16:53.847
after the whole Ken Burns thing, Bob?

16:53.884 --> 16:55.551
You know I only did that

16:55.594 --> 16:58.835
because you and Joe Buck
planted all that Swedish porn

16:58.872 --> 17:01.152
and a dueling pistol in my suitcase

17:01.189 --> 17:02.642
at the '93 All Star Game.

17:02.679 --> 17:04.550
Yeah, but that was really funny, Bob.

17:04.587 --> 17:07.796
The Baltimore airport police
didn't think so.

17:08.073 --> 17:10.664
Oh, yeah, that's why we
planted the gun.

17:12.191 --> 17:15.770
In all seriousness though,
done a lot of work on myself.

17:15.944 --> 17:18.413
I'm finally in a place where
I can admit to you

17:18.739 --> 17:21.511
that that was 100% Joe Buck.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.167
Joe Buck. I warned you about him.

17:24.204 --> 17:27.373
No, you were right. Not all
sociopaths are serial killers.

17:27.626 --> 17:29.975
- Punk.
- Punk ass bitch.

17:32.692 --> 17:34.792
Oh, God.

17:35.414 --> 17:38.222
You know, I forgot how delightful it is

17:38.312 --> 17:40.655
to share a meal with
a fellow raconteur.

17:40.806 --> 17:43.812
You know, one time I had dinner
with Dick Cavett.

17:43.849 --> 17:46.735
It turned into a two-week
river cruise of the Danube.

17:46.772 --> 17:49.097
We were on Peter Bogdanovich's
houseboat.

17:49.134 --> 17:50.998
Well, we should do this again
sometime soon.

17:51.075 --> 17:52.834
Aw.

17:53.307 --> 17:58.441
You know, I feel like I should
get something off my chest.

17:58.855 --> 18:01.658
Part of the program is we, uh,

18:01.747 --> 18:04.027
we make amends to people
we feel we have wronged.

18:04.064 --> 18:06.083
- Yeah.
- And uh...

18:07.904 --> 18:09.814
Bob, I was the one
who gave you pink eye

18:09.851 --> 18:11.513
at the Sochi Olympics.

18:11.737 --> 18:13.020
- What?
- Yeah.

18:13.097 --> 18:15.155
Now, you ever been to Ojai?

18:15.194 --> 18:16.776
They got a delightful bistro there...

18:16.984 --> 18:18.169
I don't understand.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.158
All the doctors told me it was viral.

18:20.195 --> 18:21.833
Oh, it was. Oh, it took some doing.

18:21.895 --> 18:24.428
I mean, I have connections
with the Russian Mafia.

18:24.864 --> 18:27.276
And... but the tough part was
getting into the second eye.

18:27.428 --> 18:30.052
You son of a bitch!

18:30.609 --> 18:33.270
I've won 28 Emmys, a Peabody,

18:33.307 --> 18:35.134
hosted who knows how many Olympics,

18:35.171 --> 18:37.567
World Series, Super Bowls, NBA Finals,

18:37.604 --> 18:40.252
and nobody gives a shit about
any of that anymore.

18:40.289 --> 18:41.865
But that's why I want to
make it up to you.

18:41.902 --> 18:44.933
After all I've done,
if you Google my name,

18:45.012 --> 18:47.971
the first thing that comes up
is pink eye.

18:48.129 --> 18:51.582
Before all the honors,
even before Bob Costas' feet.

18:51.725 --> 18:55.041
And as it happens, my feet
are goddamn delightful.

18:55.078 --> 18:56.763
Well, now, Bob, does this mean you,

18:56.800 --> 18:58.546
you're not gonna help out George Brett?

18:58.625 --> 19:02.309
Oh, no, I'm gonna help him,
and you know why?

19:02.420 --> 19:06.467
Just so that every day I can
think about how George Brett

19:06.538 --> 19:08.800
is satisfying your ex-girlfriend

19:08.895 --> 19:11.078
in ways you never dreamed of.

19:11.115 --> 19:12.294
So long, douche bag.

19:12.331 --> 19:14.607
Okay. Ow.

19:15.174 --> 19:17.399
Just because you put
hollandaise on a hot dog,

19:17.436 --> 19:19.055
it doesn't make it a Benedict, Steve.

19:19.092 --> 19:20.834
Good God.

19:21.841 --> 19:24.258
Oh, boy, George Brett.

19:24.438 --> 19:26.235
- How you doing, Jim?
- Oh, I'm good.

19:26.272 --> 19:27.454
Hey, I can't thank you enough

19:27.491 --> 19:28.914
for putting in a good word for me.

19:28.951 --> 19:31.955
- It means the world to me.
- Sure, George. Sure.

19:32.631 --> 19:33.928
We cool?

19:34.127 --> 19:36.015
Oh, yeah, we're cool, George.

19:36.126 --> 19:38.085
Did you really move to Morristown?

19:38.181 --> 19:40.070
Butler Heights.

19:40.204 --> 19:42.846
Ten miles out of town,
that way you're up on a hill

19:42.883 --> 19:44.871
and above that smell. That's smart.

19:44.908 --> 19:46.828
You always were the smart one, George.

19:46.865 --> 19:49.152
- You know how great she is.
- I do.

19:49.189 --> 19:50.445
That's why I want you to give her

19:50.482 --> 19:52.455
all the love that she deserves.

19:53.435 --> 19:56.004
- So we're cool?
- George, we're cool.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.277
Okay, buddy. Good to see you.

19:57.314 --> 19:58.908
Okay, you too.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.271
Hey, hey, you know who I just saw?

20:09.308 --> 20:10.623
Crocodile Dundee.

20:11.046 --> 20:13.050
It was George Brett, Gus.
Are you kidding?

20:13.087 --> 20:15.220
Oh. Hey, you know that singer Lorde?

20:15.436 --> 20:16.905
She wrote a song called "Royals"...

20:16.942 --> 20:19.199
I know. Lorde wrote the song
"Royals" about George Brett.

20:19.236 --> 20:21.889
I'm aware that the man's
magnetism was so intense

20:21.926 --> 20:24.228
that a single image of him
autographing baseballs

20:24.265 --> 20:27.503
was enough to inspire
a 17-year-old Kiwi goth teen

20:27.646 --> 20:29.923
to write the biggest single
of the 21st century.

20:29.990 --> 20:32.276
So glad I know it too, Gus.
You know why?

20:32.313 --> 20:33.738
'Cause every time I hear that song,

20:33.775 --> 20:35.292
which because it's a modern classic

20:35.329 --> 20:36.811
should be pretty much all the time,

20:36.848 --> 20:39.066
I get to be reminded about
how the love of my life

20:39.108 --> 20:41.767
traded up and is never ever
coming back to me again.

20:41.804 --> 20:44.841
Great talking to you as always, dummy.

20:45.346 --> 20:48.788
Hey, I just saw a guy who
looked like Crocodile Dundee!

20:51.113 --> 20:52.907
<i>Open with runners in scoring position</i>

20:52.944 --> 20:54.835
<i>for the first time here this afternoon</i>

20:54.872 --> 20:57.228
<i>as Stubblefield looks at a fastball</i>

20:57.265 --> 20:58.761
on the outside corner for a strike.

20:58.798 --> 21:00.411
2-0. Check it, 1-1.

21:00.448 --> 21:02.200
Sorry about that, folks.

21:03.259 --> 21:06.064
Breaking ball, missed outside
this time, 1-2.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.865
Just did it again.

21:08.106 --> 21:10.579
- Count's 2-2.
- 2-1.

21:11.174 --> 21:13.984
My goodness, three decades
of broadcasting,

21:14.021 --> 21:15.812
I don't think I've ever
butchered the count.

21:15.849 --> 21:17.190
At least not quite that badly.

21:17.227 --> 21:19.670
Well, it's spring training
for broadcasters too, Jim.

21:19.707 --> 21:21.557
So it is. Thank you, Gabby.

21:21.816 --> 21:23.841
Stubblefield fouls that one
down the right side,

21:23.878 --> 21:25.415
2-1... no, 2-3.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.645
2-3? Doesn't even make any sense.

21:27.682 --> 21:29.507
Sorry, folks, check it. 2 balling...

21:29.560 --> 21:31.683
2 balls... and tiny...

21:34.383 --> 21:35.925
Jim, are you having a stroke?

21:35.962 --> 21:39.172
I wish. I think I have the yips.
