WEBVTT

01:25.503 --> 01:25.879
CAN I GALLOP HIM?

01:25.879 --> 01:28.965
Laura: No. YOU BE
CAREFUL, NELLIE OLESON.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.718
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO GET ALL WINDED.

01:31.885 --> 01:33.136
[PONY SNORTS]

01:41.728 --> 01:43.855
Charles: LAURA, COME ON.
TIME To Go.

01:44.022 --> 01:45.940
THAT'S ENOUGH.
PA'S READY TO GO.

01:46.107 --> 01:48.109
JUST ONE MORE TIME.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.278
Laura: No.
NOW, GET OFF.

01:51.446 --> 01:52.864
YOU OUGHT TO GET
A SADDLE FOR HIM.

01:53.031 --> 01:54.365
I DON'T NEED ONE.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.409
IF HE WAS MINE, I'D
GET HIM A SADDLE.

01:56.576 --> 01:57.827
WELL, HE ISN'T YOURS.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.662
I WISH HE WAS. WOULD
YOU LEND HIM TO ME?

01:59.829 --> 02:00.914
NO.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.290
WHY NOT?

02:02.457 --> 02:03.875
I'D LET YOU PLAY
WITH MY CHINA DOLL.

02:04.042 --> 02:05.335
LEND HIM TO ME
FOR A WEEK,

02:05.502 --> 02:06.669
AND I'LL LET
YOU PLAY

02:06.836 --> 02:07.962
WITH MY CHINA
DOLL ALL THAT TIME.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.214
NO!

02:09.380 --> 02:10.965
I'LL BUY HIM
FROM YOU.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.759
HE'S NOT FOR SALE.

02:12.926 --> 02:14.761
YOU'D BUY HIM FOR
ME, WOULDN'T YOU?

02:14.928 --> 02:17.055
THE PONY,

02:17.222 --> 02:18.765
IF I TOLD YOU HOW
MUCH I WANTED HIM?

02:18.932 --> 02:20.600
I DON'T KNOW.
NOW, I, UH...

02:20.767 --> 02:21.810
PLEASE.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.603
I PROMISE I WON'T
ASK FOR ANOTHER

02:23.770 --> 02:25.730
SINGLE, SOLITARY
THING FOR CHRISTMAS

02:25.897 --> 02:28.775
IF YOU BUY ME BUNNY.

02:28.942 --> 02:31.110
WELL, LAURA, WILL YOU
TAKE $5.00 FOR HIM?

02:31.277 --> 02:32.904
HE'S NOT FOR SALE.

02:33.071 --> 02:35.490
Nellie: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT.
ONLY YOUR PA CAN SAY THAT.

02:35.657 --> 02:38.827
HE'S FOR SALE,
ISN'T HE, MR. INGALLS?

02:38.993 --> 02:39.786
WELL, I'M AFRAID NOT,
NELLIE. THAT'S LAURA'S PONY.

02:39.953 --> 02:42.413
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO SELL HIM,

02:42.580 --> 02:43.957
SHE DOESN'T
HAVE TO SELL HIM.

02:47.627 --> 02:49.546
YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE A SADDLE.

02:56.010 --> 02:56.803
I HATE THAT
NELLIE OLESON.

02:56.970 --> 03:00.682
LAURA, DON'T SAY "HATE."
AND DON'T EVEN THINK HATE.

03:00.849 --> 03:02.809
NOW, YOU MAY BE ANGRY,
BUT TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

03:02.976 --> 03:06.062
I'M SURE NELLIE MUST HAVE
SOME FINE QUALITIES IN HER.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.647
YOUR MOTHER'S RIGHT.

03:07.814 --> 03:09.899
ON THE WAY HOME, WE'LL
TRY TO THINK OF ONE.

03:10.066 --> 03:12.360
HA HA!

03:16.823 --> 03:18.783
OOH! OOH! AGAIN!

03:18.950 --> 03:20.118
AGAIN.

03:20.285 --> 03:21.619
YEAH!

03:21.786 --> 03:24.122
IT'S A GOOD THING WE RAN
INTO NELLIE OLESON TODAY

03:24.289 --> 03:25.623
OR WE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN
ABOUT CHRISTMAS ALTOGETHER.

03:25.790 --> 03:27.041
Laura: NOT ME.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.543
Mary:
NOR ME EITHER.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.086
NOT ME EITHER!

03:30.253 --> 03:32.005
OH. BUT WHAT IF WE
DID FORGET?

03:32.171 --> 03:33.923
YOU THINK SANTA CLAUS
WOULD COME ALL THE WAY DOWN

03:34.090 --> 03:36.009
FROM THE NORTH POLE
FOR CHRISTMAS ANYWAY?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.844
WHAT'S CHRISTMAS?

03:38.011 --> 03:39.804
"WHAT'S CHRISTMAS?"

03:39.971 --> 03:42.181
WELL, THAT'S
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

03:42.348 --> 03:46.936
HERE. LET'S SEE
IF I CAN SHOW YOU.

03:47.103 --> 03:48.187
THERE.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.106
NOW, YOU SEE
THAT STAR UP THERE?

03:50.273 --> 03:51.566
THE REAL BIG ONE?

03:51.733 --> 03:54.485
WELL, A LONG, LONG TIME AGO,

03:54.652 --> 03:55.862
A STAR LIKE THAT
APPEARED IN THE SKY.

03:56.029 --> 04:00.199
EXCEPT IT WAS MUCH, MUCH
BIGGER AND MUCH BRIGHTER.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.118
NOW, LOTS
OF PEOPLE SAW IT,

04:02.285 --> 04:04.996
BUT ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
KNEW WHAT IT MEANT:

04:05.163 --> 04:07.874
SOME SHEPHERDS,
3 KINGS, 3 WISE MEN.

04:08.041 --> 04:12.211
AND THEY FOLLOWED THAT STAR
A LONG, LONG WAY.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.297
THEY FINALLY
CAME TO A MANGER.

04:14.464 --> 04:16.215
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY FOUND?

04:16.382 --> 04:18.301
A BABY.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.053
BABY JESUS.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.346
AND HE WAS GOD'S SON.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.264
AND GOD GAVE HIM
TO THE WORLD

04:23.431 --> 04:25.475
BECAUSE HE LOVED US.

04:25.642 --> 04:29.354
SO, CHRISTMAS IS
THE BABY JESUS' BIRTHDAY.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.897
Caroline: AND NOW,
YOUNG LADY,

04:31.064 --> 04:33.358
IT'S TIME
FOR DREAM LAND.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.234
GIVE ME MY KISS.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.072
MMM...GOOD NIGHT,
DARLING.

04:49.540 --> 04:52.251
THIS IS OUR
FIRST CHRISTMAS HERE.

04:52.418 --> 04:54.629
I KNOW THAT.

04:54.796 --> 04:56.547
AND WE HAVE TO GET
SOMETHING SPECIAL

04:56.714 --> 04:58.925
FOR MA AND PA.

04:59.092 --> 05:01.844
I DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.722
DO YOU?

05:04.889 --> 05:07.350
TOMORROW I'M GONNA
FIND OUT WHAT MA WANTS.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.152
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:18.319 --> 05:19.779
COUNTING.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.621
HOW MUCH
DO YOU HAVE?

05:28.788 --> 05:30.915
I'M NOT GONNA TELL.

05:31.082 --> 05:33.001
THEN I WON'T.

05:34.544 --> 05:36.295
I DON'T HAVE MUCH.

05:36.462 --> 05:38.673
NEITHER DO I.

05:54.105 --> 05:55.356
IT'S COLD TONIGHT.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.941
MMM, THAT IT IS.

05:57.108 --> 05:58.568
DO YOU MIND GETTING
SOME MORE WOOD?

05:58.735 --> 06:00.528
I'LL GET SOME RIGHT NOW.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.395
MA, WHAT CAN I GET
PA FOR CHRISTMAS?

06:34.562 --> 06:37.648
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
GONNA GIVE HIM MYSELF.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.192
I'M SURE THAT HE'LL LIKE

06:39.358 --> 06:40.026
WHATEVER YOU FINALLY
GIVE HIM.

06:40.193 --> 06:43.237
IT'S GOT TO BE SPECIAL.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.531
THIS IS OUR FIRST
CHRISTMAS HERE.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.700
WELL, ONE THING
IS CERTAIN.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.619
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY
TO BUY PRESENTS.

06:49.786 --> 06:51.287
IF IT'S GOING TO BE
SPECIAL, WE'RE GOING

06:51.454 --> 06:53.372
TO HAVE TO MAKE IT
THAT WAY OURSELVES.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.474
YOU MEAN YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY IDEAS AT ALL?

07:11.641 --> 07:13.810
I'M AFRAID NOT,
HALF-PINT.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.521
YOUR MA'S NOT ONE
FOR ASKING FOR THINGS.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.022
I'VE BEEN SCROUNGING
AROUND IN MY HEAD,

07:18.189 --> 07:19.398
TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

07:19.565 --> 07:21.317
I JUST KEEP COMING UP
EMPTY-HANDED.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.570
BUT I WANT TO GIVE
HER SOMETHING.

07:24.737 --> 07:27.907
I KNOW YOU DO. SO DO I.

07:30.493 --> 07:32.703
HOW DID YOU LEARN TO
MAKE A FISH TRAP, PA?

07:32.870 --> 07:35.123
HMM, JUST KIND OF
PICKED IT UP.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.707
HAVING TO DO IT FOR
YOURSELF IS THE BEST

07:36.874 --> 07:38.167
TEACHER THERE IS.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.627
COME ON. DON'T FRET.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.254
WE'LL THINK OF
SOMETHING FOR MA.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.839
[WIND]

07:43.005 --> 07:45.258
OH! IT'S GETTING COLD!

08:14.495 --> 08:17.373
Caroline: LAURA,
DON'T TOUCH IT.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.125
Charles: OH...

08:19.292 --> 08:21.586
LOOKIT HERE, CARRIE.

08:25.131 --> 08:26.674
OH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU

08:26.841 --> 08:28.301
IN JUST
A MINUTE, MRS. INGALLS.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.219
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S NO HURRY.

08:30.386 --> 08:32.638
TWO DOZEN TODAY,
ALL CANDLED.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.230
OH!

08:41.397 --> 08:43.357
HEH. PARDON ME.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.776
MY LANDS.
PRICES ARE GOING UP.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.154
WELL, OF COURSE,
MR. INGALLS.

08:48.321 --> 08:49.947
IT IS
THE CHRISTMAS SEASON.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.450
I ALMOST FORGOT.

08:52.617 --> 08:55.119
NOW, UH, HOW MANY
DID YOU SAY?

08:55.286 --> 08:56.787
TWO DOZEN, I SAID.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.247
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL MARK IT DOWN.

08:58.414 --> 09:00.082
HAS THE PRICE
OF EGGS GONE UP?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.752
WELL, OF COURSE NOT.

09:04.462 --> 09:05.755
NOW WE KNOW WHAT

09:05.922 --> 09:07.089
CHARLES DICKENS
HAD IN MIND

09:07.256 --> 09:08.507
WHEN HE WROTE ABOUT
EBENEZER SCROOGE.

09:08.674 --> 09:09.800
CHARLES!

09:09.967 --> 09:11.219
Mr. Oleson:
BE RIGHT WITH YOU, INGALLS.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.970
[STIFLED CHUCKLE]
TAKE YOUR TIME.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.683
I KNOW WHAT MA
WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS,

11:22.850 --> 11:24.477
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO GET IT FOR HER.

11:24.643 --> 11:25.311
I KNOW WHAT
PA NEEDS.

11:25.478 --> 11:27.521
WHAT?

11:27.688 --> 11:29.148
I'M NOT GONNA TELL.

11:29.315 --> 11:30.900
WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL YOU

11:31.067 --> 11:33.027
WHAT MA WANTS, EITHER.

11:36.489 --> 11:38.699
WELL, WHAT DID YOU HAVE
IN MIND FOR TODAY, INGALLS?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.076
I NEED A MEASURE
OF GUNPOWDER,

11:40.242 --> 11:40.326
3 BARS OF LEAD.

11:40.493 --> 11:42.578
RIGHT.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.038
MY MISSIS HAS GOT
A LIST, TOO.

11:44.205 --> 11:45.498
YOU'LL HAVE TO CHECK
WITH HER.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.041
SAY, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW WHERE I COULD

11:47.208 --> 11:48.709
PUT MY HANDS ON A SET OF
BUCKBOARD WHEELS, WOULD YOU?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.419
I HAVE A CUSTOMER
WHO NEEDS A SET,

11:50.586 --> 11:52.254
AND THERE AIN'T A WHEELWRIGHT
IN THE WHOLE COUNTY.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.131
WOULD HE SETTLE
FOR USED?

11:54.298 --> 11:55.549
WELL, HOW USED?

11:55.716 --> 11:56.342
PRETTY BAD RIGHT NOW,
BUT I COULD FIX THEM UP.

11:56.509 --> 11:58.761
I KNOW WHERE THERE'S
A WRECKED WAGON.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.221
YOU AIN'T
NO WHEELWRIGHT.

12:00.388 --> 12:02.181
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I AM OR I'M NOT.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.183
I NEVER TRIED. HOW MUCH
YOU WILLING TO PAY?

12:04.350 --> 12:07.103
WELL, I'LL GO
$6.00 FOR THE LOT.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.687
NO. MM-MM.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.564
FOR USED WHEELS
OUT OF A WRECK?

12:10.731 --> 12:13.818
NO. $9.00 FOR WHEELS
IN REAL GOOD SHAPE.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.903
7.00.

12:16.070 --> 12:17.822
$8.50.

12:17.988 --> 12:20.199
DELIVERED
BEFORE CHRISTMAS?

12:20.366 --> 12:21.826
BEFORE CHRISTMAS,
AND YOU DON'T

12:21.992 --> 12:23.577
HAVE TO BUY THEM IF
YOU DON'T LIKE THEM.

12:23.744 --> 12:24.370
8.00.

12:24.537 --> 12:26.789
DONE.

12:26.956 --> 12:28.457
GOOD ENOUGH.

12:35.631 --> 12:36.924
Charles: WHOA!

12:37.091 --> 12:39.135
Caroline:
WHAT ON EARTH...

12:39.301 --> 12:42.596
I GOT A LITTLE
REPAIR WORK TO DO.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.141
WHAT FOR? WHAT IS THIS?

12:45.307 --> 12:47.893
NOW, CAROLINE, YOU
KNOW THAT CHRISTMAS

12:48.060 --> 12:49.979
IS NOT A TIME
TO ASK QUESTIONS.

13:03.534 --> 13:04.702
Mary: YOU Go HOME.

13:04.869 --> 13:06.620
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
IMPORTANT TO DO.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.080
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:08.247 --> 13:09.790
IT'S A SECRET.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.417
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
MA SAID I COULD.

13:11.584 --> 13:14.211
SAID YOU COULD WHAT?

13:14.378 --> 13:17.756
THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW
AND YOU TO FIND OUT.

13:42.823 --> 13:46.160
YOU'RE MIGHTY SOLEMN
FOR A MONDAY AFTERNOON.

13:46.327 --> 13:48.245
PA, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN MAKE

13:48.412 --> 13:49.872
A LOT OF MONEY?

13:50.039 --> 13:51.749
I'M AFRAID NOT,
HALF-PINT.

13:51.916 --> 13:53.042
THAT'S A RIDDLE

13:53.209 --> 13:54.543
I HAVEN'T SOLVED
FOR MYSELF YET.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.003
WOULDN'T KNOW WHERE
TO START

13:56.170 --> 13:57.922
FOR A PRETTY
YOUNG GIRL LIKE YOU.

14:04.345 --> 14:05.930
AH, AH. DON'T--
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

14:06.096 --> 14:06.472
WHAT IS IT?

14:06.639 --> 14:09.558
WELL, IT'S JUST SOMETHING.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

14:09.725 --> 14:11.852
CHRISTMAS IS NOT A TIME
FOR PRYING AND POKING AROUND,

14:12.019 --> 14:13.771
NOR FOR ASKING QUESTIONS.

14:13.938 --> 14:15.898
IT SURE IS A TIME
FOR SECRETS.

14:16.065 --> 14:16.482
OH, THAT IT IS.

14:16.649 --> 14:19.568
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU SCOOT?

14:30.079 --> 14:31.330
GUESS WHAT!

14:31.497 --> 14:32.706
YOU SWALLOWED
A MOUSE?

14:32.873 --> 14:34.166
NO, SHE
SWALLOWED A PIG.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.252
MA, I'M SERIOUS.
I BET YOU CAN'T GUESS.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.671
YOU'RE RIGHT, DEAR.
I CAN'T. WHAT IS IT?

14:38.837 --> 14:40.297
Mary: I WENT
To MRS. WHIPPLE'S, MA,

14:40.464 --> 14:42.007
AND SHOWED HER HOW
I COULD SEW A SEAM

14:42.174 --> 14:43.968
AND DO FRENCH KNOTS,
CHAIN STITCHES,

14:44.134 --> 14:45.970
RUNNING STITCHES,
CROSS STITCHES--

14:46.136 --> 14:47.596
Charles:
HI, EVERYBODY.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.139
WELL, THAT'S
QUITE A WELCOME.

14:49.306 --> 14:50.349
OH, PA, THE MOST
WONDERFUL THING

14:50.516 --> 14:51.600
HAS HAPPENED.

14:51.767 --> 14:52.893
YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO SAY YES.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.395
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO
GIVE ME PERMISSION.

14:54.562 --> 14:55.854
WELL, MAYBE I WILL GIVE
YOU PERMISSION

14:56.021 --> 14:57.439

I THINK THERE

39:12.226 --> 39:13.394
MIGHT BE SOMETHING UNDER
THAT TREE FOR HALF-PINT.

39:13.561 --> 39:14.145
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

39:17.815 --> 39:19.650
THIS LOOKS LIKE
A HALF-PINT PRESENT.

39:19.817 --> 39:22.194
PRETTY BIG FOR
A HALF-PINT SIZE PRESENT.

39:54.518 --> 39:57.688
I KNEW HOW MUCH
YOU WANTED ONE.

39:57.855 --> 40:00.066
I HAD A HARD TIME KEEPING
IT HIDDEN FROM YOU, TOO.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.359
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T WANT
YOU SNEAKING IN THE BARN.

40:12.286 --> 40:15.206
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY
REALLY LIKES HER PRESENT.

40:21.212 --> 40:22.838
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

40:23.005 --> 40:26.300
MERRY CHRISTMAS, PA.

40:26.467 --> 40:28.761
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
THE REST OF YOU,

40:28.928 --> 40:30.429
BUT I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT

40:30.596 --> 40:31.055
WHO GAVE ME WHAT
IN THAT BIG BOX.

40:31.222 --> 40:34.100
Charles: WELL, THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

40:34.266 --> 40:35.476
LET'S OPEN IT.

40:35.643 --> 40:37.394
Charles: HAMMER'S
ON THE MANTEL.

40:41.899 --> 40:43.484
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

40:43.651 --> 40:45.152
Caroline:
I CAN Do IT.

40:57.123 --> 41:00.084
OH, IT'S THE STOVE!

41:03.087 --> 41:05.631
I WONDER
WHO GAVE THAT TO YOU.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.305
LAURA?

41:23.065 --> 41:23.274
LET ME SEE.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.747
OH, OH.
CAREFUL THERE.

41:38.914 --> 41:40.666
HELLO, NELLIE.

41:40.833 --> 41:42.126
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
INGALLS.

41:42.293 --> 41:43.919
SAME TO YOU, OLESON.

41:46.630 --> 41:47.923
Mr. Oleson:
MERRY CHRISTMAS,

41:48.090 --> 41:49.341
EVERYBODY.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.302
WELL, MRS. INGALLS,
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

41:51.468 --> 41:52.678
OH, I...

41:52.845 --> 41:55.431
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

41:55.598 --> 41:57.057
SHE'S QUITE
A SHARP TRADER.

41:57.224 --> 41:59.018
OF COURSE, SHE HAD
ME OVER A BARREL,

41:59.185 --> 42:00.561
KNOWING HOW MUCH
NELLIE WANTED

42:00.728 --> 42:02.146
THAT PONY. HA!

42:07.443 --> 42:09.737
Laura: COME ON, NELLIE.
LET'S GET BUNNY.

42:09.904 --> 42:10.988
I'M SORRY, INGALLS,

42:11.155 --> 42:12.531
THAT I HAD TO SPOIL
YOUR SURPRISE,

42:12.698 --> 42:13.949
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I COULD SAY.

42:14.116 --> 42:15.201
I UNDERSTAND.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.410
MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.

42:16.577 --> 42:18.078
MERRY CHRISTMAS
TO YOU.

42:23.167 --> 42:25.377
CHARLES, HER PONY,
WE CAN'T--

42:25.544 --> 42:27.755
CAROLINE,
SHE HAD THE RIGHT.

42:27.922 --> 42:30.799
BUT SHE LOVES BUNNY SO.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.927
I THINK SHE
LOVES YOU MORE.

42:33.093 --> 42:34.470
OH, I CAN'T...

42:34.637 --> 42:37.514
CAROLINE,
SHE WANTS TO DO THIS.

42:37.681 --> 42:39.683
SHE LOVES YOU.
DON'T SPOIL IT FOR HER.

42:39.850 --> 42:41.101
OH...

43:16.345 --> 43:19.056
I'LL BE GOOD TO HIM.
I PROMISE.

43:21.183 --> 43:23.477
YOU BETTER BE.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.354
COME ON.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.156
Mr. Oleson:
THANK YOU, LAURA.

43:36.323 --> 43:38.409
NOW, STEADY, BUNNY.
THAT'S A GIRL.

43:45.916 --> 43:49.837
THERE YOU GO. YOU GOT
A NEW HOME. YES, SIR.

43:50.004 --> 43:51.588
STEADY, BUNNY.

43:57.303 --> 43:59.305
OH, LAURA...

44:00.514 --> 44:04.018
OH...l JUST LOVE
MY STOVE.

44:04.184 --> 44:06.478
DON'T CRY.

44:06.645 --> 44:09.023
SOMEDAY WE'LL
HAVE ANOTHER PONY.

44:09.189 --> 44:10.774
IT'S NOT THE PONY.

44:13.652 --> 44:15.154
I'M SORRY ABOUT
ALL THE HARD WORK YOU

44:15.321 --> 44:17.239
HAD TO DO
ON THE SADDLE, PA.

44:30.336 --> 44:31.879
OH, SADDLE.

44:43.807 --> 44:46.810
PAPA, OPEN MINE.

44:52.441 --> 44:55.486

44:55.652 --> 44:58.781

44:58.947 --> 45:00.115
WELL, THAT'S QUITE
A PRESENT.

45:00.282 --> 45:01.367

45:01.533 --> 45:02.993

45:03.160 --> 45:04.703

45:19.635 --> 45:23.013

45:26.058 --> 45:29.311
