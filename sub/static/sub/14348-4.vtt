WEBVTT

00:09.542 --> 00:12.010
Mm-hmm.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.047
Uh--

00:16.000 --> 00:22.074

00:47.580 --> 00:51.584
He loves drama.
That's his... thing.

00:53.420 --> 00:55.922
Blood.
Surprise appearances.

00:55.957 --> 00:58.223
Stigmata.

00:58.258 --> 01:01.594
That shit's been working
for over 2,000 years.

01:02.095 --> 01:06.099
Did he try
the regular-guy crap yet?

01:06.134 --> 01:10.103
The "I really need
a sandwich" routine?

01:11.438 --> 01:15.108
Well, at least you got that
to look forward to.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.617
You mind?

01:30.123 --> 01:33.126
Make it a double.

01:40.834 --> 01:43.101
Hey. Hey!

01:43.136 --> 01:46.473
I have to get to work, pal!
Hey!

01:46.508 --> 01:48.908
Son of a bitch.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.314
What, you got something
against firefighters, asshole?

01:54.547 --> 01:56.583
Huh? You know, I got two
brothers who are cops, right?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.050
One of 'em works out
of the D.A.'s office.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.988
Couple of weeks ago, I tried to piss on
a pile of souvenirs down at Ground Zero.

02:02.489 --> 02:05.825
You guys picked me up, I
was out an hour later. Okay?

02:05.860 --> 02:09.127
You hear me? Okay.

02:09.162 --> 02:11.331
I guess what I'm
trying to say is--

02:15.668 --> 02:17.670
Unless you're plannin'
on shooting me right now,

02:18.037 --> 02:21.508
I'm gonna kick your fat bagel ass
up and down this entire shitty block.

02:22.008 --> 02:24.976
Okay?

02:25.011 --> 02:26.613
You know what's funny?
No. What?

02:27.113 --> 02:31.684
The guy who just towed your truck away?
He makes more money a year than you do.

02:34.020 --> 02:37.023
Yeah, that is funny.
Tell you what.

02:37.058 --> 02:39.025
Free shot.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.702
Ow!

02:52.305 --> 02:54.506
So, when the F.D.N.Y...

02:54.541 --> 02:57.544
reads the report
from the N.Y.P.D....

02:58.044 --> 03:00.980
that says you just broke
your hand on a cop's face,

03:02.215 --> 03:05.385
your brothers-- they gonna
make sure you get paid...

03:05.420 --> 03:08.555
while you're out of action
for the next three months?

03:10.056 --> 03:12.559
Hey! Aah. Hey!

03:17.830 --> 03:22.068
Kiss my ass, jerk-off.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.477
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

03:32.512 --> 03:35.782
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

03:36.282 --> 03:38.618
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:39.085 --> 03:41.921
Things were good
when we were young

03:42.388 --> 03:45.491
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

03:45.526 --> 03:48.595
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

03:48.630 --> 03:52.063
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

03:52.098 --> 03:54.934
Things were good
when we were young

03:55.401 --> 03:58.403
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

03:58.438 --> 04:01.607
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

04:01.642 --> 04:04.961
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

04:04.996 --> 04:08.281
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

04:12.986 --> 04:16.639
Are you tired of the same old same
old when it comes to makeovers?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.293
Wake up because this is not your
ordinary makeover show. Oh, no.

04:45.318 --> 04:48.488
- It's okay. You're eating for two.
- For two. I know.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.491
I'll see you later.

04:51.526 --> 04:53.493
Bye, baby.

05:03.836 --> 05:07.674
So I turned to alcohol
to replace the affection...

05:07.709 --> 05:10.510
my mother and father
never gave me.

05:10.545 --> 05:13.478
Anyway,

05:13.513 --> 05:18.017
without this idea-- A.A.--

05:18.518 --> 05:22.522
without this particular group, without
you guys and your willingness to listen,

05:22.557 --> 05:24.489
I'd still be drinking.

05:24.524 --> 05:27.026
Thank you all
so, so much.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.789
Look, my name's, uh, Bob,

05:39.824 --> 05:43.042
and, uh, I'm an alcoholic.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.009
Hi, Bob.
Hi, Bob.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.548
I, uh-- I just wanted to say, my mother
was a controlling goddamn bitch too.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.051
And, uh--
Now she's dead.

05:52.086 --> 05:55.019
And my father is 82,
and, uh,

05:55.054 --> 05:57.522
he still pretty much drinks
more than I ever used to.

05:57.557 --> 06:00.309
And when I was a kid, if I tied
the bathroom up for too long,

06:00.344 --> 06:03.062
he'd also take the opportunity
to remind me that my nose...

06:03.097 --> 06:05.530
was always gonna be bigger
than my cock.

06:05.565 --> 06:09.033
I just met my new stepmother,
and she's from Korea.

06:09.068 --> 06:13.072
And I don't know her that well, but I'm
pretty sure she's a raging alcoholic.

06:13.107 --> 06:17.076
The point being that I didn't drink
because my father called me a pussy...

06:17.111 --> 06:20.079
or because my mother told me I was
gonna be no good when I grew up.

06:20.114 --> 06:23.047
I drank because...
I like to drink. Okay?

06:23.082 --> 06:26.050
I like to drink.
I like vodka. I like whiskey.

06:26.085 --> 06:29.589
But I'd pretty much drink anything you put
in front of me that had alcohol in it...

06:29.624 --> 06:31.556
because I love to drink,
okay?

06:31.591 --> 06:35.595
The only reason I quit was because I was
gonna lose my job and probably my kids too.

06:35.630 --> 06:39.599
So that's the deal. Uh, you guys
aren't keeping me from drinking.

06:39.634 --> 06:44.121
It's the law, and, uh,
God didn't make me quit.

06:44.156 --> 06:48.608
It was my ex-wife,
or my soon to be ex-wife.

06:48.643 --> 06:50.610
Thanks.

06:56.115 --> 06:59.118
Hey, I remember you from another
meeting a couple years back.

06:59.153 --> 07:02.138
You're, uh, Tommy, the
firefighter. No, no. I'm a plumber.

07:02.173 --> 07:05.124
Hey. Nice thing you said
there. I really appreciate that.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.627
I'm so sick of these
whiners. Good one, Bob.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.129
Yeah. See? Bob.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.617
Daddy?

07:32.652 --> 07:35.905
Mmm. What's up?

07:35.940 --> 07:39.158
Keela.
Oh. Mmm.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.165
Last night was so--

07:46.666 --> 07:48.633
What?

07:48.668 --> 07:52.171
Nothing.
What, baby?

07:52.672 --> 07:56.676
Mmm. You're probably sleeping with,
like, six other people. Forget it.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.143
Dad.

07:59.178 --> 08:03.683
Hang on, sweetheart. Hey, I am not
sleeping with six other people, all right?

08:05.184 --> 08:08.187
Dad!
Two seconds, kiddo.

08:08.222 --> 08:11.190
So maybe just a few?
Yeah.

08:14.026 --> 08:16.529
I don't think
I like those odds.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.831
Dad!
Uh, hang on, Keela.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.167
Wait. Wait a minute.
What-- What odds?

08:23.202 --> 08:26.038
I said, "Are you sleeping with six
other people?" and you said, "No."

08:26.539 --> 08:29.876
- I said, "A few?" and you said, "Yeah."
- No, I didn't.

08:29.911 --> 08:34.212
- Yeah, you did.
- No, I didn't.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.052
You know I have A.D.D.,
right?

08:40.087 --> 08:42.352
No, seriously. I--

08:42.388 --> 08:44.390
Wh-What were we
talkin' about?

08:51.564 --> 08:54.567
You gotta be
shittin' me.

09:00.406 --> 09:02.874
Ow. Geez.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.661
Looks like it might be broken.
Nah. It's just a sprain.

09:05.696 --> 09:08.379
Why don't we go to the
hospital? You get an X-ray.

09:08.414 --> 09:10.850
You're no good to anybody working
with a bum hand on the job.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.854
I got to be back in that house. I need the
action. Otherwise, I start drinking again.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.357
Besides, I'm better with one
hand than most guys are with two.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.527
Yeah, I heard that about you. Yeah. Hey.

09:24.030 --> 09:27.533
You know how people-- like, religious
people-- are always saying stuff like,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.869
"Have you found Jesus?"
Yeah.

09:29.904 --> 09:32.438
Guess what. I found him.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.775
Oh, yeah? Where's he been
for the last 2,000 years?

09:35.810 --> 09:37.575
Apparently,
my new apartment.

09:37.610 --> 09:43.115
Yeah. He shows up, on the
cross, half off the cross.

09:43.482 --> 09:47.453
When you quit drinking at first,
did stuff like this happen?

09:47.488 --> 09:49.956
I don't even know if I
believe in the goddamn guy.

09:49.991 --> 09:52.959
Well, maybe that's why
he's showing up.

09:52.994 --> 09:55.979
Listen,
I used to get voices...

09:56.014 --> 09:58.965
first two months
I was sober.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.968
Sometimes I thought,
you know, it was, like, God.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.804
Sometimes it was Satan.
Two months?

10:04.839 --> 10:06.604
Yup.

10:06.639 --> 10:09.440
God was telling me I was
a worthless piece of shit.

10:09.475 --> 10:12.478
Satan's telling me I'm God's
gift. What did God sound like?

10:12.979 --> 10:15.982
Tom Hanks.
Figures.

10:16.482 --> 10:17.984
Satan
was a doubleheader.

10:18.484 --> 10:21.237
One day he was, like,
Jack Nicholson.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.632
The next, you know,
like, Hillary.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.957
And then what?
It just stopped?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.761
I made them stop.
How'd you do that?

10:30.997 --> 10:32.999
These got rid of God.

10:35.501 --> 10:38.004
These got rid of Jack.

10:39.005 --> 10:41.007
What about Hillary?

10:46.512 --> 10:48.479
Wow.

10:48.514 --> 10:50.481
Any of these,
um, painkillers?

10:50.516 --> 10:54.020
No. Nice try.
Nothing self-prescribed.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.689
They just kill
psychological pain.

10:57.056 --> 11:02.028
Oh. Aren't these kind of, um,
against the rules of A.A.?

11:02.063 --> 11:05.131
There are no rules,Bob.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.832
The point is,
priorities.

11:07.867 --> 11:11.704
You know, I figure, if I'm not
drinking today, I'm all right...

11:11.739 --> 11:14.171
because I know God--

11:14.206 --> 11:17.543
not the Catholic scary God
that we grew up with,

11:17.578 --> 11:20.546
the real actual God--

11:20.581 --> 11:22.381
is on my side.

11:24.717 --> 11:27.685
Alrighty then. You
understand what I'm saying?

11:27.720 --> 11:31.390
Yeah. I understand. There is
no God because you are god.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.190
You're not listening,
asshole.

11:33.225 --> 11:36.061
- Listen, I'm just saying--
- What? What are you saying?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.898
You telling me you don't have
some kind of God complex?

11:39.265 --> 11:42.001
I run into burning buildings to save people
God apparently doesn't give a shit about, okay?

11:42.036 --> 11:43.736
So I got a suggestion.

11:44.236 --> 11:47.239
Why don't you get down on your knees and ask
Jesus why his father's letting this happen?

11:47.274 --> 11:51.243
We don't really talk
about his dad. I gotta go.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.579
Hey, Tom.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.748
What's Jesus look like?

11:55.783 --> 11:58.584
Mel Gibson.

11:59.585 --> 12:01.886
Goin' deep!
That's fantastic, Teddy.

12:01.921 --> 12:06.258
Yeah! Scores! What's that? Eagles
this year? I don't think so.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.095
What's your touchdown dance,
Teddy?

12:09.428 --> 12:12.865
- Yes!
- Stop. Stop! Goddamn it! Stop!

12:13.299 --> 12:17.536
- What's wrong, Teddy?
- That guy! That guy standing right in my eyeline!

12:17.571 --> 12:19.772
Yeah, you!
Harris?

12:20.005 --> 12:22.374
You think this is easy,
numb nuts?

12:22.641 --> 12:25.076
I'm trying to be
in the moment here.

12:25.111 --> 12:28.948
I'm trying to pretend I'm a guy who's going
to a football game to watch his team play.

12:28.983 --> 12:31.050
I'm trying to be that guy,

12:31.317 --> 12:34.286
not some guy stuck in a
studio under hot lights...

12:34.321 --> 12:37.556
surrounded by
the fruit of the month club!

12:37.591 --> 12:40.392
No offense, everybody.
None taken.

12:41.627 --> 12:44.130
Eli, I need a moment.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.465
Five minutes, people!

12:53.672 --> 12:55.639
What are you doing?
Huh?

12:55.674 --> 12:58.144
You're a little half mast.
I don't even feel you.

12:58.179 --> 13:00.111
I'm trying to--

13:00.146 --> 13:03.149
Just give me a couple seconds. Okay.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.153
Okay.
Stop, stop, stop.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.159
Usually when we get a hotel
room, it really turns you on.

13:13.659 --> 13:16.127
What's wrong? I don't
know. Maybe it's--

13:16.162 --> 13:20.166
- 'Cause I'm going back to work today,
I'm a little-- - It's my belly, isn't it?

13:20.399 --> 13:23.702
What?
No. It's not your belly.

13:23.737 --> 13:27.006
- No, baby.
- You said "no baby."

13:28.274 --> 13:30.141
- No, I didn't.
- Ooh!

13:30.176 --> 13:32.178
No, I didn't. I didn't
say-- It's the baby.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.113
What? No. I said you--

13:34.613 --> 13:37.616
I said, "No, baby,"
not meaning "no baby."

13:38.117 --> 13:42.621
The baby I meant was you, like, you
know, you're my baby. "No, baby." You.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.588
Wait. What--
You're confusing me.

13:44.623 --> 13:47.626
You're confusing me!
I know what I said.

13:51.630 --> 13:54.133
You don't find me
attractive anymore, do you?

13:54.168 --> 13:56.535
Of course I-- Sheila.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.506
Listen to me.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.544
Listen. Of course
I find you attractive.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.511
Okay?

14:07.546 --> 14:11.300
I love
your little belly.

14:11.335 --> 14:15.054
I love
your chocolaty lips...

14:16.555 --> 14:20.024
and your
chocolaty tits...

14:20.059 --> 14:23.312
and your nice, soft,

14:23.347 --> 14:26.565
sweet little
cocoa ass.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.405
I think
it's the booze.

14:34.907 --> 14:39.376
You know what I mean?
What?

14:39.411 --> 14:41.914
You can't have sex with me
unless you're drunk.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.981
I had a suspicion.
I had a hunch.

14:44.016 --> 14:47.186
No. I think since I quit drinking,
it screwed up my pleasure center.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.688
That's the only way you can forget
about Jimmy and the whole situation.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.925
That's not what I meant.
You're not listening to me.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.578
What are you doing?

14:55.613 --> 14:58.162
Sheil-- Are you nuts?

14:58.197 --> 15:00.933
Yeah, that's a great idea.
That's real good for the kid.

15:03.936 --> 15:06.438
Sheila. Stop it!

15:09.308 --> 15:11.277
Stop it!

15:14.280 --> 15:16.782
Drink these.
No, I can't.

15:16.817 --> 15:18.749
Do it.
I can't.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.786
I'm horny, Tommy.
Sheila, I--

15:20.821 --> 15:22.753
Listen to me!

15:22.788 --> 15:26.292
The only thing that I have
in this world is Damien, okay?

15:26.327 --> 15:28.759
And he's almost 16,

15:28.794 --> 15:33.764
and he never tells me anything even
remotely resembling the truth...

15:33.799 --> 15:37.636
about what's going on in his head because
he doesn't want me to know how bad he feels,

15:37.671 --> 15:39.937
how much
he misses his dad.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.808
So I stay home,
and then I dream...

15:42.843 --> 15:45.644
about the two or three
times a week...

15:46.145 --> 15:49.148
when I'll get to have
physical contact with you--

15:49.183 --> 15:51.417
your muscles...

15:51.452 --> 15:53.652
and your smell.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.654
Sheila.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.157
And your hands...

15:59.158 --> 16:03.162
on my skin, on my ass,
on my tits.

16:05.164 --> 16:08.667
I don't give a shit
about A.A.

16:12.171 --> 16:14.923
I think that
the real battle...

16:14.958 --> 16:17.676
is between your cock...

16:18.677 --> 16:21.078
and your liver.

16:21.113 --> 16:23.115
And you can buy a new liver.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.619
Here. Drink this.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.874
Come on.

16:32.909 --> 16:35.092
Come on.

16:35.127 --> 16:37.129
Oh.

16:41.633 --> 16:45.102
I gotta go.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.889
Ow!
Oh, my God.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.642
Oh!

16:58.550 --> 17:01.553
We thought you were dead,
asshole. Hey! How you doing?

17:01.588 --> 17:03.520
Why'd you think
I was dead?

17:03.555 --> 17:06.058
Well, you called Tommy and
you said that you owed money...

17:06.558 --> 17:08.060
and that some guy
was following you.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.527
Oh, you must mean Perry.

17:10.561 --> 17:13.332
Yeah, I thought he was a leg
breaker. Boy, was I wrong there.

17:13.598 --> 17:16.367
Turns out he's a talent scout
for Big Skin Pro Gear.

17:16.402 --> 17:19.238
Real football fans weren't
buying because of the models.

17:19.738 --> 17:22.241
They were using your typical
male-catalog models.

17:22.276 --> 17:24.242
You know, thin,
good-lookin'--

17:24.278 --> 17:26.412
Gay.
Exactly!

17:26.645 --> 17:31.183
So, they figured, why not use models
that look like actual football fans?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.736
Well, look no further,
my friend.

17:33.771 --> 17:36.220
I am a professional
plus-size model.

17:36.255 --> 17:40.259
Care for some Gorgonzola? No,
I'm trying to drop a few pounds.

17:40.294 --> 17:43.762
Man, you know how much money
I'm taking in?

17:43.797 --> 17:45.864
How much?
Ten large.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.267
Ten large?
Yup.

17:50.936 --> 17:52.938
Pass me that Gorgonzola.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.442
Yeah?
Is it true?

17:56.809 --> 18:00.279
What? Mickey said you quit drinking
and you're going to meetings.

18:00.314 --> 18:03.247
Yeah. You happy now, ass wipe?
Yeah, I'm as hard as a rock.

18:03.282 --> 18:05.784
That's good 'cause I need you to fix
some shit with this Jew bag beat cop.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.253
The guy I told you about. I think I broke
his nose this morning. It's a long story.

18:09.288 --> 18:13.292
I need you to get the whole thing taken care
of, 'cause I'm back in my old house today.

18:13.327 --> 18:16.260
Plus I need you to get my truck
taken care of because he had it towed.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.798
On top of which I need you to investigate
that hick fireman who was banging Janet.

18:20.299 --> 18:23.068
Let me get this straight. You quit drinking,
but you're going around beating up cops?

18:23.103 --> 18:26.805
- This city was safer when you were a drunk.
- Yeah, blow me. All right?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.772
- Tommy.
- Johnny?

18:28.807 --> 18:31.310
- Tom.
- Hey, I held up my end of the deal, okay?

18:31.810 --> 18:33.777
I quit drinking,
all right?

18:33.812 --> 18:38.984
Find my truck, find my kids and get
that bagel cop off my block, all right?

18:39.019 --> 18:40.986
That's a wrap, everybody.

18:44.156 --> 18:46.957
I can do this.
Do what?

18:46.992 --> 18:48.959
This! That--
what you just did.

18:48.994 --> 18:52.498
Pretending to throw a football
and smiling like a goddamn fool.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.333
Jesus Christ.
Talk about easy money.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.800
Hey, slow down there,
short stuff.

18:56.835 --> 18:59.338
It may look easy 'cause
I make it look easy.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.591
Eli says I have a
natural talent. For what?

19:02.626 --> 19:05.309
For being a big, fat,
happy-go-lucky slob?

19:05.344 --> 19:09.515
Bet your balls you do. Hey,
introduce me to your agent.

19:09.550 --> 19:12.351
Okay, but not everyone
gets to go to the big show.

19:12.386 --> 19:14.686
If by "big" you mean fat,

19:15.187 --> 19:18.957
you definitely hit the nail
on the head, lard ass.

19:25.697 --> 19:27.466
-Hey.
- Hey.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.302
- Whoa. What's with the piece?
- Huh?

19:30.802 --> 19:33.670
The gun. Oh, n--
nothing. I just--

19:33.705 --> 19:37.042
You're not thinking about
using that thing, are you? No.

19:37.077 --> 19:39.278
Listen, I heard about
you and Theresa.

19:39.313 --> 19:41.480
You're not gonna
off yourself, are you?

19:41.515 --> 19:43.447
No. Of course not.
All right.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.884
What are you gonna do?
You're not gonna shoother?

19:45.919 --> 19:49.154
I was... maybe gonna
scare her a little.

19:49.421 --> 19:53.892
That's a good idea. Chicks love that. Wave
a gun in their face-- instant blow job.

19:53.927 --> 19:56.662
It's just so goddamn frustrating.
All right. Calm down. Geez.

19:56.697 --> 19:59.363
You know what we can do to blow
off some of that steam? What?

19:59.398 --> 20:02.401
Take that puppy out to the firing range,
squeeze off a couple hundred rounds.

20:02.901 --> 20:05.737
You ever done it? I'm like
the Dirty Harry of the F.D.N.Y.

20:05.772 --> 20:09.575
- Who?
- You know, Clint Eastwood?

20:09.808 --> 20:11.642
Yeah.

20:11.677 --> 20:14.545
Dirty Harry?
Yeah.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.916
The Outlaw Josey Wales? Are we
still talking about Clint Eastwood?

20:17.951 --> 20:20.217
Forget it!
I sawMillion Dollar Baby.

20:20.252 --> 20:24.089
Engine. Ladder.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.927
Hey, you think Hillary Swank
could kick her husband's ass?

20:32.197 --> 20:35.899
- Who's she married to again?
- Chad Lowe, Rob Lowe's little brother.

20:35.934 --> 20:40.439
I know that guy. Every time she wins an
Oscar, he's in the audience crying his ass off.

20:40.474 --> 20:42.941
He's a pussy. Everybody make
your picks. I'm going Swank.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.876
- Swank.
- Swank.

20:45.143 --> 20:48.447
- Swank.
- I used to have a subscription to that magazine.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.368
Hey, what's up, Chief?
You all right?

20:53.403 --> 20:55.852
Caught wind
of a problem with Lou.

20:55.887 --> 20:59.356
Apparently Laura screwed up, and Lou
got pissed at her and called her a name.

20:59.391 --> 21:03.562
And she dropped a dime on him down at
headquarters, and now they wanna suspend him.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.564
- Yeah. What'd he call her?
- A twat.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.635
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She hates that word.

21:09.670 --> 21:11.970
Well, all chicks do, right?

21:15.641 --> 21:17.976
Zeta-Jones.
Zeta-Jones.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.312
- Zeta-Jones.
- Zeta-Jones.

21:23.148 --> 21:25.484
You're not messing around
with her, are you?

21:25.717 --> 21:27.217
What are you, nuts?
She's not even my type.

21:27.252 --> 21:30.621
Franco, she's got two tits,
a pussy, and she's breathing.

21:30.656 --> 21:35.260
So my taste in women has a wide set of
parameters. But I ain't that goddamn stupid.

21:35.527 --> 21:36.995
- I would hope not.
- Chief.

21:37.496 --> 21:41.333
Hey, look, I got enough on my goddamn
plate, between Tommy, my wife and Lou.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.602
Enough bullshit.
That broad is trouble.

21:43.637 --> 21:46.155
Now, just stay the hell
away from her, huh?

21:46.190 --> 21:48.674
I don't know what you're
talking about, Chief.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.009
Before the accident?
Before the accident.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.278
Siegfried.

21:53.545 --> 21:55.847
15 to dispatcher,
copy that transmission.

21:55.882 --> 21:58.517
Battalion 15 to Manhattan,

21:58.884 --> 22:01.353
we got smoke blowing out of the
third floor on a five-floor walk-up.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.523
Boys, we got a report from the dispatcher
of a kid being trapped on the top floor.

22:04.558 --> 22:07.693
Tommy, you take missy
and do a search.

22:08.060 --> 22:11.530
Lou, take the probie, go around back,
go to the roof and help them ventilate.

22:11.565 --> 22:14.800
Garrity, get up in that bucket.
Once again, transmit the 10-75.

22:18.537 --> 22:21.089
What's the matter
with your hand?

22:21.124 --> 22:23.642
Nothing.
I hurt it jerking off.

22:24.142 --> 22:26.478
Go check that out.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.781
All right. The roof is open,
Chief. Checking exposures now.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.684
Chief, find the girl?
That's a negative on that.

22:33.719 --> 22:37.556
- Well, you give us a signal, we'll take out the windows.
- You got it, Lou.

22:37.591 --> 22:40.023
Mommy, are you here?
Hey.

22:40.058 --> 22:43.026
Here you go, sweetheart.
You're all right. Come on.

22:43.061 --> 22:45.530
- My mommy went to the store.
- That's okay. Give me your hand.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.999
I'm afraid of the fire. No.
There's no fire in here, sweetheart.

22:48.034 --> 22:51.837
Give me your hand.
Come on. Here. Here.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.204
There you go.
You're fine.

22:54.239 --> 22:57.743
Chief, I got the 10-45. I'm bringing
her out. Good, Tommy. Bring her out.

22:57.778 --> 23:00.245
Okay. Here, let me hold
your cat, sweetheart.

23:00.746 --> 23:02.713
Give me your cat.

23:02.748 --> 23:05.048
Tommy, come on out. Take
it easy. Tommy's out?

23:05.083 --> 23:08.051
-Should we take out the windows?
-That's a negative on those windows.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.423
- Don't take those windows out. Do not take those windows out.
- What did he say?

23:11.458 --> 23:15.460
- He said take the windows. - Do
not vent the windows-- Fucking radio.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.262
Come here.

23:24.269 --> 23:28.071
That's it.
Cover up, sweetheart.

23:28.106 --> 23:31.443
Chief! Mayday! Mayday! Gotta get
that bucket up here right now!

23:31.676 --> 23:34.045
Battalion 1-5, clear the air.
We got a Mayday!

23:34.080 --> 23:35.781
Stay down, sweetheart,
all right?

23:49.327 --> 23:52.262
- Are you ready?
- Shit! The bucket's stuck.

23:52.297 --> 23:55.133
- Come here, sweetheart.
- Hold on, Tommy! Don't go!

23:55.367 --> 23:57.736
-Tommy, what are you doing?
Wait, Tommy, no.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.603
Oh, Jesus!

23:59.638 --> 24:03.809
Hang on, sweetheart. Oh,
Jesus. It's gonna be okay.

24:04.976 --> 24:08.062
Mr. Whiskers.
Mr. Whiskers!

24:08.097 --> 24:11.114
Goddamn it!
Mr. Whiskers.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.151
He's lucky he knows
his goddamn name.

24:13.552 --> 24:15.854
Where is he?

24:15.889 --> 24:18.156
Jesus Christ.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.926
No time to talk right now, pal.
Just take the cat and go.

24:23.428 --> 24:25.831
Here he comes.
All right, catch!

24:27.165 --> 24:29.633
You ready?

24:29.668 --> 24:33.505
- All right.
- What-- Was that a cat?

24:33.872 --> 24:35.841
Here I come!

24:39.344 --> 24:41.680
Come here!

24:43.448 --> 24:46.017
You all right?

24:48.353 --> 24:50.821
All right.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.192
Here we go again.
Welcome back.

24:54.426 --> 24:55.961
Hey, check it out.
62 Truck!

24:56.461 --> 24:59.464
Hey, 62 Truck! Brighter
Harlem, baby! Yeah!

25:04.970 --> 25:07.472
Who gave the order? There was no
order. It was a miscommunication.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.474
These goddamn
walkie-talkies.

25:09.975 --> 25:11.942
Thank God we had the spare rig,
otherwise we wouldn't have had a bucket.

25:11.977 --> 25:16.381
Hey. What the hell? Want me to stand behind
the rig so you can just back the thing over me?

25:16.416 --> 25:18.884
I'm really sorry, Tommy. I thought I
heard the go-ahead. Life and death, kid.

25:18.919 --> 25:21.887
Life and death.
Get out of here.

25:23.955 --> 25:26.491
Hey, Tom, you think that group shot of
us is gonna end up in the paper tomorrow?

25:26.992 --> 25:29.459
I sure hope so, man. 62
Truck deserves the attention.

25:29.494 --> 25:32.831
Hey, that was something else. Welcome
back to the house, you douche bag.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.031
All right. All right.

25:35.066 --> 25:38.069
What is this, some kind
of a goddamn party? Hey.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.036
You're back in the house, Gavin. Yeah?

25:40.071 --> 25:43.658
But you make one mistake, just one--
you so much as forget to flush a toilet,

25:43.693 --> 25:47.245
and you're back out in the goddamn
boonies sitting on your bony Irish ass,

25:47.280 --> 25:49.915
praying for some Boy Scout
to rub two sticks the wrong way.

25:49.950 --> 25:53.418
Yeah, I got it. Lou!
Jerry! Up in my office now!

26:01.426 --> 26:03.894
What was all that about?

26:03.929 --> 26:07.933
I forgot to back Lou up in a
fire last week, or I was confused.

26:07.968 --> 26:10.936
Whatever. And he called me
something he shouldn't have.

26:10.971 --> 26:13.670
I asked him to apologize,
and he refused.

26:13.705 --> 26:16.825
So you called headquarters?
I had to. I'm a firefighter.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.910
I have the same job as you,
and I come in here every day,

26:19.945 --> 26:24.282
and it's "honey" and "missy" and
"sweetie" and "Barbie" and now this?

26:24.649 --> 26:27.083
If I don't do something,
I'm letting down...

26:27.118 --> 26:29.621
every other little girl
who comes in here after me.

26:30.121 --> 26:33.124
So what'd he call you, the "B" word? No.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.460
He called you the "C" word? No.

26:35.495 --> 26:37.729
He called you a twat.

26:38.964 --> 26:43.635
You know,
this conversation's over.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.971
He called you a twat!

26:46.338 --> 26:49.272
You don't deny that you
said it to her? Nope.

26:49.307 --> 26:52.143
And that it was just the one derogatory
term, and you said it only once.

26:52.178 --> 26:54.746
Correct. It's your word against hers.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.280
Nobody else heard
the conversation.

26:57.315 --> 27:00.652
You deny, deny, deny.
The guys will back you up.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.619
We'll freeze her out,

27:02.654 --> 27:06.491
and I'll bet my left nut she requests
a transfer within three weeks.

27:08.326 --> 27:11.997
You don't play the game, we have to go
with the choices headquarters gave us.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.099
Which are?
They're not good.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.936
Basically, you accept
the 30-day suspension.

27:18.203 --> 27:19.671
Without pay, Kenny.

27:20.171 --> 27:22.941
Or you stay on the payroll, and
you go through sensitivity training.

27:22.976 --> 27:24.908
Sensitivity training?

27:24.943 --> 27:27.779
Laura, the thing is, we call
each other names all the time.

27:27.814 --> 27:30.666
- It's, like, you know-- What
do you call it? - Name-calling?

27:30.701 --> 27:33.518
No. It's like, uh-- It's like
ball busting, but more-- more--

27:33.553 --> 27:36.252
Camaraderie.
Yeah. No.

27:36.287 --> 27:39.024
- No, no.
- It's part of being on a team, you know?

27:39.524 --> 27:41.491
You joke around,
you jibe, you cut.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.863
I never sit around with my
girlfriends and call them a twat.

27:45.096 --> 27:48.533
I was on the basketball team in high school.
I was on the girls' softball team in college.

27:48.568 --> 27:51.720
And I never called any of those
women a twat. You know why?

27:51.755 --> 27:54.873
'Cause every woman I've ever met
finds that word offensive.

27:55.240 --> 27:59.711
Not as offensive as the other word, but,
you know, in a race they're neck and neck.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.714
Yeah, but you know what? Now
you work at a job with men, okay?

28:02.749 --> 28:05.181
Highly populated by men.
A job you chose to do.

28:05.216 --> 28:08.518
So you gotta cut the men
you work with a little slack.

28:08.553 --> 28:11.354
I thought the word that women
hated most was the "C" word.

28:11.389 --> 28:14.392
I thought they invented "twat" so no one
would have to say the other word ever again.

28:14.893 --> 28:18.897
I think men invented both and never
bothered to check with women about either.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.364
Okay, what would you
prefer then?

28:21.399 --> 28:24.402
That we come up with, what--
a brand-new word?

28:24.437 --> 28:27.405
I mean, I don't know.
A combination of the two?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.539
Whoa. "Cwat."

28:29.574 --> 28:33.078
No, no. I was thinking
more like "twunt."

28:35.580 --> 28:38.048
Aw, come on.
That's funny.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.185
- "Twunt." I like that.
- I'm sticking with "cwat."

28:40.485 --> 28:42.754
- Nobody likes it, Sean.
- Why don't we ask Laura?

28:42.987 --> 28:44.522
She's the only one affected
in this particular case.

28:45.023 --> 28:48.026
She's the only one affected by either of
these words. Laura, what's your opinion?

28:48.061 --> 28:52.430
I actually find "cwat" more
offensive than "twat," monkey boy.

28:54.365 --> 28:56.232
"Monkey boy"?

28:56.267 --> 28:58.401
You sure about this?
I'm sure.

28:58.436 --> 29:01.272
You don't want to take a little
bit more time? It's final.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.275
All right. I'll call
headquarters, tell 'em.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.242
Sensitivity training it is.

29:06.277 --> 29:10.115
This could open up another whole can
of worms. Well, you know what, Jer?

29:10.150 --> 29:13.083
Worms have rights too.

29:13.118 --> 29:16.621
God, Laura, this shit doesn't
mean anything around here, okay?

29:17.122 --> 29:19.124
I call Tommy a mick,
he calls me a spic.

29:19.159 --> 29:21.091
Sean calls Mike a
stupid guinea-- Hey!

29:21.126 --> 29:23.927
I know, I know. You're not
stupid. The point is this.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.464
We all use every ethnic and personal
slur in the book against each other.

29:26.965 --> 29:29.634
- You name it, we say it. - It's
true. Cock breath. - Shithead.

29:29.669 --> 29:31.402
- Ass wipe. - Numb
nuts. - Ball face.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.154
- Shit for brains.
- Dipshit.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.604
- Pussy. -
Prick. - Dick.

29:34.639 --> 29:37.107
- Scumbag. - Dick
face. - Uh, ape ass.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.811
- Ape face. - Pencil dick.
- Tight ass. - Needle dick.

29:40.044 --> 29:44.082
- That's not even getting into any of the gay stuff.
- Well, that's debatable.

29:44.382 --> 29:47.919
Yeah, but nobody's been emotionally
affected by the words we just used. Right?

29:48.219 --> 29:52.757
Yeah. What were those things you
were saying about the ape things?

29:53.057 --> 29:55.326
Look, we're getting
off the point here, okay?

29:55.361 --> 29:57.560
The point is, when I run
into a burning building,

29:57.595 --> 30:00.063
I don't go in with the Bible in my
back pocket or with God at my side.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.601
I run in with a couple of pieces of steel
in my hand and you guys-- all of you guys.

30:04.035 --> 30:06.469
And if we're lucky enough
to make it back here alive,

30:06.504 --> 30:09.774
part of the job is sitting down and
owning up to the mistakes you made.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.510
Like the probie today--
He screwed up and he owned up.

30:12.877 --> 30:15.311
That's the deal.
You can't legislate courage.

30:15.346 --> 30:18.148
You can't run down to headquarters and
buy yourself a big bag full of balls.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.785
There's no judge on Earth who can order you
to give enough of a shit about other people...

30:20.820 --> 30:23.688
that you go running into
eight floors full of flame.

30:24.189 --> 30:28.491
It takes guts. You let Lou down,
he called you a twat. Get over it.

30:28.526 --> 30:32.363
The real issue is, next time we're in a fire,
are you gonna be where you're supposed to be--

30:32.864 --> 30:35.867
watching somebody else's
back, okay?

30:35.902 --> 30:40.003
Twat, cwat,
bitch or twunt--

30:40.038 --> 30:43.041
Do your job the right way, people'll
call you names you wanna hear.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.189
Hey, what did you mean
before when--

30:59.224 --> 31:02.727
Your new haircut makes you
look like a monkey,

31:03.228 --> 31:05.230
and not a cute one either.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.217
Hey. What are you taking?

31:27.252 --> 31:31.221
Oh, uh, prescription.
Vicodin. My shoulder. You know?

31:31.256 --> 31:34.759
They're still prescribing those
things like, what, four months later?

31:34.794 --> 31:37.779
What are you doing, using Elvis's
doctor? Nah, I got a source.

31:37.814 --> 31:40.791
I'm just on them for a couple of
more weeks. I'm back in the gym.

31:40.826 --> 31:43.768
Soon as I get my strength back to
where it used to be, I'm off 'em.

31:44.269 --> 31:47.237
Well, I'm just saying there's
a guy I quit drinking with, man.

31:47.272 --> 31:50.240
I just found out a couple of days
ago he's still taking tons of pills.

31:50.275 --> 31:53.778
Sometimes you don't realize, especially when
they're strong, how dependent you get on them.

31:53.813 --> 31:56.114
Ah, no. I'm good, bro.
All right.

31:56.614 --> 32:00.118
If you're having a problem, you want to
talk to somebody, you can always talk to me.

32:00.153 --> 32:01.619
All right. Thanks.
All right?

32:02.120 --> 32:03.586
Yeah.
Okay.

32:03.621 --> 32:07.625
Hey, uh, your source--
Can he get, uh, Viagra?

32:07.859 --> 32:10.461
No, no, it's not for me.
It's my, uh-- my old man.

32:10.962 --> 32:14.799
He's banging this chick, this young
chick. Yeah, I'll look into it.

32:14.834 --> 32:17.135
Cool.
I'll get back at you.

32:17.635 --> 32:19.137
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

32:37.155 --> 32:39.657
These goddamn things
would choke a horse.

33:02.180 --> 33:04.182
Whew.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.190
For his own good.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.052
No way.
I look like a goddamn--

33:41.552 --> 33:43.054
Spider monkey.

33:43.554 --> 33:45.056
Shit. So-- Sorry.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.025
Goddamn it.

33:48.060 --> 33:50.460
Stupid barber!

33:50.495 --> 33:52.730
You went to a barber? It
was 10 bucks, all right?

33:53.231 --> 33:56.199
- Christ!
- Holy shit, Sean.

33:56.234 --> 34:00.071
That's some real live Steven Seagal
mojo you got going on right there.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.908
Steven Seagal?
Yeah, man. Damn.

34:04.909 --> 34:07.377
All right. You know what?
This is a huge mistake.

34:07.412 --> 34:10.748
I'm shooting out of anger, which is--
it's not only wrong, it's dangerous...

34:11.248 --> 34:14.752
since it made you think of quite possibly
the worst action hero of all time.

34:16.254 --> 34:18.221
All right, you're up.
Come on.

34:18.255 --> 34:20.757
I want you to hit the last
bottle on the left, all right?

34:21.259 --> 34:23.226
Just, uh, hold your arm out
nice and straight.

34:23.261 --> 34:26.597
Use your other arm to
steady it, if you want. Okay.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.366
Okay? You ready?

34:28.866 --> 34:31.902
All right. You can close
one eye, if it helps to aim.

34:31.937 --> 34:34.938
And then, you know, just
take a deep breath and--

34:45.616 --> 34:48.583
Wait. Yeah, I think
he's still breathing.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.621
What? That's the sound of the wind
whistling through the gaping hole...

34:51.657 --> 34:54.090
you just blew
in its midsection.

34:54.125 --> 34:57.128
Jesus. Guns are no joke. Imagine
if this cat was your ex-girlfriend.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.131
It wouldn't really matter. One
bullet would've just made her angry.

35:00.166 --> 35:02.633
Excuse me. We got an
emergency. This cat's been shot.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.469
Dr. Collins?

35:09.140 --> 35:11.142
Whoa.
Who shot it?

35:11.177 --> 35:12.942
Him.
Mm-hmm.

35:12.977 --> 35:17.148
- Why, might I ask?
- Um, we were hunting, kind of.

35:17.183 --> 35:21.319
- For cats? - No. No, no,
no. It was, um, actually--

35:21.686 --> 35:23.821
Follow me.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.993
Not you.

35:35.333 --> 35:39.302
What's the matter?
Hmm? Oh, it's nothing.

35:39.337 --> 35:42.840
Are these your usual? It'll take
me a day or so to get the Viagra.

35:42.875 --> 35:45.343
Actually, it's not Viagra.
It's a longer-lasting one.

35:45.843 --> 35:47.345
Oh.
Which longer-lasting one?

35:47.845 --> 35:52.016
I think it's the 18-hour one.
Wait, no. It might be the 36-hour.

35:52.051 --> 35:54.352
Shit. There's so many.
I don't know.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.652
Yeah, well,
the guy's in his 80s.

35:56.687 --> 35:59.524
Thirty-six hours might be
longer than he has to live.

36:02.293 --> 36:04.362
What?

36:04.862 --> 36:07.865
The only time we get together is when
you come pick up your weekly stash.

36:07.900 --> 36:10.833
Oh, come on, baby. That's
not true. Yes, it is.

36:10.868 --> 36:14.205
You come here, we bang our brains out,
you take your pills then you leave.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.541
Every Thursday.
Oh, is today Thursday?

36:16.908 --> 36:19.942
- Yes.
- Okay, so it's true.

36:19.977 --> 36:23.214
Why can't we go out?
Or to dinner, a movie or both?

36:23.447 --> 36:25.916
We can. Of course we can. Really?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.351
- Yeah. Why not?
- Tomorrow?

36:28.386 --> 36:31.722
Uh, no, baby. I gotta
work. What about Saturday?

36:32.123 --> 36:34.123
I'm at my parents
all weekend.

36:34.158 --> 36:37.395
I'm working on Monday, got a
thing at Keela's school on Tuesday,

36:37.430 --> 36:40.048
fixing a friend's place
on Wednesday.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.667
So, uh, why don't we say
next Thursday?

36:42.934 --> 36:44.735
Dinner?
Dinner and a movie.

36:44.770 --> 36:47.405
You pick.
Cool.

36:47.772 --> 36:49.240
Cool.

36:51.242 --> 36:53.010
And don't forget
my pills, okay?

36:59.951 --> 37:02.920
It'll just be a minute.
Why don't you have a seat?

37:34.952 --> 37:37.420
Okay. All set. Oh, is
he gonna be all right?

37:37.455 --> 37:42.460
Him? He was a paperweight with fur
about two seconds after the bullet hit.

37:43.961 --> 37:47.298
These are my numbers--
home, office, cell.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.100
I like men
who are smaller than me.

37:51.135 --> 37:54.138
Being a firefighter
just adds extra points.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.814
You leave first.
Oh.

38:31.175 --> 38:34.111
You know, I could really use
a sandwich right about now.

38:36.113 --> 38:38.115
That's funny?

38:38.616 --> 38:43.621
Well, yeah. It's exactly what your
mother said, uh, you would say.

38:43.656 --> 38:46.490
She have kind of a henna
shade hair? Kind of reddish?

38:46.525 --> 38:48.859
- Yeah.
- Was she drinking?

38:48.894 --> 38:51.696
Yeah.
Scotch?

38:52.196 --> 38:54.198
Irish whiskey actually.

38:54.432 --> 38:57.433
Rocks?
Yeah.

38:57.468 --> 39:00.204
That wasn't my mom.
That was my girlfriend.

39:00.604 --> 39:02.373
- Mary Magdalene.
- Oh.

39:02.873 --> 39:06.342
She hates my guts. Well, no,
she loves me and she hates me.

39:06.377 --> 39:10.381
I was never home. I was always out with
the guys. I never took her anywhere.

39:10.416 --> 39:14.385
Blah, blah, blah. I don't have to
tell you about that bullshit, right?

39:14.420 --> 39:16.852
Yeah, broads.

39:16.887 --> 39:19.390
You making me a sandwich
or what?

39:19.790 --> 39:21.826
Yeah, let me see
what I have.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.835
Lettuce, pickles.

39:52.089 --> 39:55.558
If I stepped it off

39:55.593 --> 39:59.263
Walked outside your trance

39:59.298 --> 40:02.898
Crawled inside your mind

40:02.933 --> 40:07.772
And got my hand
into your pants

40:23.788 --> 40:27.291
Don't forget the alcohol

40:27.658 --> 40:31.128
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

40:31.629 --> 40:35.132
Don't forget the alcohol

40:35.167 --> 40:38.135
Ooh, baby

40:39.637 --> 40:43.307
Don't forget the alcohol

40:43.541 --> 40:47.144
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

40:47.978 --> 40:51.899
Don't forget the alcohol

40:51.934 --> 40:55.795
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

40:55.830 --> 40:59.745
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

40:59.780 --> 41:03.661
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby

41:04.161 --> 41:07.748
Ooh, baby, baby

41:07.783 --> 41:11.335
Ooh, baby, baby

41:24.181 --> 41:28.185
Don't forget the alcohol

41:32.690 --> 41:36.694
Don't forget the alcohol

41:45.369 --> 41:48.873
Don't forget the alcohol

41:52.877 --> 41:55.462
"Little girl is hurled."
That's great, man.

41:55.497 --> 41:58.013
Finally some good press
for the F.D.N.Y.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.015
Perolli got a call from
downtown. They were beaming.

42:00.050 --> 42:03.020
Hey, some priest stopped by
to see you before you got in.

42:03.055 --> 42:05.990
Saw your picture in the paper.
Father Murphy from the Bronx.

42:06.025 --> 42:08.993
Yeah? Never heard of him.
What'd he look like?

42:09.460 --> 42:11.996
Um, Willem Dafoe. You know? The
bad guy from the Spider-Man movie.

42:12.463 --> 42:14.899
He was tall, thin, blond hair.
He was you, basically.

42:14.934 --> 42:16.918
You guys saying I look
like Willem Dafoe?

42:16.953 --> 42:18.868
No. The priest looked
like Willem Dafoe. Oh.

42:18.903 --> 42:22.406
- You look like Kevin Bacon.
- Kevin Bacon? Kevin Bacon's got a pig nose.

42:22.441 --> 42:24.575
Hey, yo.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.582
I just don't see it.
See what?

42:32.082 --> 42:34.334
Probie thinks I look
like Kevin Bacon.

42:34.369 --> 42:36.552
Kevin Bacon? No way.
Wayne Gretzky. What?

42:36.587 --> 42:39.089
Yeah. You know, the long nose,
the skinny neck, the hair.

42:39.124 --> 42:40.990
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey, guys.

42:41.025 --> 42:45.262
Let me ask you something. You think I
look like Kevin Bacon or Wayne Gretzky?

42:45.297 --> 42:47.865
- Conan O'Brien.
- What?

42:48.332 --> 42:50.034
Yeah, without question.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.438
That's great.
Thank you.

42:56.273 --> 42:58.876
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

43:00.110 --> 43:03.113
You see, it's all
about busting balls.

43:12.122 --> 43:14.959
Human shield! Human shield!

43:16.727 --> 43:19.630
Here's your monkey right here.
Tommy, it's your daughter.

43:21.131 --> 43:23.133
Oh! Good boy.

44:07.745 --> 44:09.179
Cloudland.
