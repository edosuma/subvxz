00:17.476 --> 00:20.513
You've gathered the entire kingdom
for this?

00:21.564 --> 00:24.101
There's a Wicked Witch out there,
just waiting to pounce,

00:24.192 --> 00:26.353
and pretending othenNise
would be dangerous.

00:26.444 --> 00:28.560
There's nothing dangerous
about rallying our people.

00:28.654 --> 00:32.238
You're announcing you're pregnant.
It's not like you invented the wheel.

00:33.409 --> 00:34.398
What's this?

00:36.621 --> 00:37.576
Belle!

00:37.663 --> 00:40.279
Are you okay? When you and Neal
disappeared, we feared the worst.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.865
We went off to see
if we could revive the Dark One.

00:42.960 --> 00:43.995
What happened?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.997
Neal was able to resurrect him.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.378
At the cost of his own life.

00:48.466 --> 00:49.751
Rumple's alive.

00:49.842 --> 00:50.877
Neal's dead?

00:50.968 --> 00:52.299
I think so.

00:52.386 --> 00:53.796
To which?

00:53.888 --> 00:54.923
Both.

00:55.014 --> 00:58.632
You see, when Rumple saw
that Neal was dying,

01:00.019 --> 01:01.475
he absorbed him.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.136
And Zelena got ahold of the dagger.

01:05.608 --> 01:06.939
Now she controls Rumple.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.015
(GROANS)

01:08.945 --> 01:11.607
Maybe now isn't
the time to announce the pregnancy.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.608
Regina is right. It's too dangerous.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.985
No! If... If we don't, we give in to fear.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.240
But if we do, we give the kingdom
what they need. Hope.

01:19.330 --> 01:21.321
We don't even know what
this Wicked Witch wants.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.498
Actually, we do.

01:25.962 --> 01:27.873
She wants your baby.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.838
She came to us when you were gone.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.165
Threatened us and our unborn child

01:32.260 --> 01:34.421
unless we told her
when you arrived in our land.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.674
She thinks
your baby could be important.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.177
I'm so sorry. She said she'd hurt us.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.257

01:48.901 --> 01:50.732

02:02.707 --> 02:05.699
Calm down, sweetie.
You don't want to go into early labor.

02:06.919 --> 02:08.580
Stay away from my wife!

02:09.338 --> 02:11.579
Ooh! Someone's testy.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.585
Enough, sis.

02:13.676 --> 02:15.257
This is between you and me.

02:17.513 --> 02:18.719
Now,

02:19.682 --> 02:22.173
let's see if this was all worth it.

02:25.563 --> 02:28.145
Oh, yes. Yes, it was.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.732
This child shall do quite nicely.

02:32.570 --> 02:35.607
So take good care of it for me.
Don't forget to eat well.

02:35.698 --> 02:38.565
I will be back for your happy day.

02:40.244 --> 02:43.611

Grumpy, tell me you found something.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.435
I've been to Blue, Tink, all the fairies.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.855
They've been scouring the forest
for enchanted items to destroy her,

03:18.949 --> 03:19.984
but they got zilch.

03:20.493 --> 03:22.199
They say she's just too powerful.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.867
-|t's happening again.
-(S|GHS)

03:23.954 --> 03:25.239
I'm about to give birth

03:25.331 --> 03:28.448
and an evil sorceress
is threatening the future of my child.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.033
To be fair,
the first time l was threatening you.

03:31.796 --> 03:33.878
Everyone else
just became collateral damage.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.750
Remind me again why we forgave her?

03:35.841 --> 03:37.092
Because I'm helping.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.379
Frustrating as it is for me to remember,

03:39.470 --> 03:43.008
Snow, you had a head start
to defeat me last time.

03:43.099 --> 03:44.134
How?

03:44.225 --> 03:46.011
-We were warned.
-By Rumplestiltskin.

03:46.102 --> 03:47.433
Well, maybe he can warn you again.

03:47.520 --> 03:48.680
GRUMPY: Wait!

03:48.771 --> 03:50.102
You wanna sneak into Rumple's castle

03:50.189 --> 03:52.145
where he's being held captive
by the Wicked Witch?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.023
Name's Grumpy, not stupid.

03:55.111 --> 03:58.228
You're right.
It is stupid, but for our child.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.187
-We'll do whatever it takes.
-REG|NA: Heartwarming.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.073
He's trapped in his own castle.

04:03.661 --> 04:05.572
Belle, you were prisoner there.

04:05.663 --> 04:10.123
Yes, but breaking in?
I would have no idea how.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.244
Luckily, I do.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.789
I broke in there once before.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.086
(CHUCKLES)
Why are we even listening to him?

04:16.173 --> 04:18.835
He's a thief.
Which means he's not to be trusted.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.632
What are you even still doing here?

04:20.719 --> 04:22.505
What I'm doing here is saving your ass.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.885
The castle has traps. And deadly ones.

04:26.976 --> 04:28.716
Not more deadly than my magic.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.347
They are, if you don't see them coming.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.144
Well, maybe I'm okay
with taking my chances.

04:32.231 --> 04:34.768
All right, you may be, but we're not.

Hopefully the same thing you see in me.
A second chance.

Feel?

05:10.060 --> 05:13.518
Yes, I can. Just not fully.

05:14.732 --> 05:16.723
It's difficult to explain.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.766
Then don't.

But they're waiting for me. I should go.

06:18.254 --> 06:20.461
if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you look smitten.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.288
(SCOFFS)
Well, if I didn't know any better

06:22.383 --> 06:24.499
I'd say Haagen-Dazs
is smitten with your stomach.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.045
Can we get started?

06:26.136 --> 06:27.387
We were waiting for Hook.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.133
I don't have time
to wait for the handless wonder.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.886
We have to figure out how
to destroy my sister.

06:32.977 --> 06:35.684
For once, I agree with Regina.
Stopping her plan is the priority.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.513
There's one thing about this plan
that doesn't fit. Regina.

06:38.774 --> 06:42.312
I'm the point of it.
So she can take my life for herself.

06:42.403 --> 06:45.315
Yes. But why bring you back
to Storybrooke? Why bring any of us?

06:45.406 --> 06:48.443
Well, no one's ever succeeded
at traveling through time.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.900
Perhaps something from this world
makes it possible.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.110
But what's almost as troubling

06:53.205 --> 06:57.039
is that she was able to cast the curse
to bring us all here in the first place.

06:57.126 --> 06:58.081
Why is that?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.830
To do it you have to give up
the thing you love most.

07:01.505 --> 07:03.837
From what I gather,
Zelena doesn't love much.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.381
Neither did you. You managed.

07:06.468 --> 07:08.845
Zelena's smart. Strategic.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.511
Perhaps we discovered something
in the missing year to stop her.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.681
And then the only way
to stop us from interfering

07:13.767 --> 07:15.678
was to bring us back here
and wipe our memories.

07:16.270 --> 07:18.181
So if we get our memories back,

07:18.772 --> 07:20.478
we might already know
how to defeat her.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.974
We just need to break this curse.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.320
Well, thank goodness we have a savior.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.729
I would love to, but there's one problem.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.907
Last time, all it took was me
believing in magic and kissing Henry.

07:31.994 --> 07:34.326
Since I've been back, I've done both,
and nothing.

07:34.413 --> 07:36.995
(GASPS) It's the belief.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.036
Henry. He needs to believe.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.628
In this new life, he doesn't.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.498
We have to get him to believe again.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.882
So, what, we put on a magic show?

07:46.842 --> 07:48.002
How did you believe?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.133
The book. The story book.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.138
That's what started Henry
on his original path.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.510
And what got you to believe. It's the key.

07:56.602 --> 07:59.184
ln him believing. ln him remembering.

08:00.314 --> 08:01.850
Remembering everything.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.561
That's not necessarily a gift.
He's been through a lot of tough stuff.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.109
And some good stuff.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.938
Either way, it's our best bet.

08:11.784 --> 08:12.864
She's right.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.492

Swept away by the last curse.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.662
A book can't just disappear.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.168
But it can just appear.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.458
The first curse.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.881
ltjust showed up in my closet
when I needed it.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.716
Or more accurately,
when Henry needed it.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.631
-What do you mean?
-He was going through a rough time.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.804
He was realizing he had been given up.

12:45.891 --> 12:47.506
He didn't feel like he had a real family.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.341
(REGINA SCOFFS)

12:50.020 --> 12:51.226
He did.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.974
That may be, but, Regina,
he wasn't feeling that way

12:54.066 --> 12:55.272
with you or with anyone.

12:55.359 --> 12:57.896
He needed to believe
in happy endings again.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.185
That's what the book gave him.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.696
Well, he needs to believe again.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.199
In fact, I think we all do.

13:09.414 --> 13:12.372
What do you say
we go check your closet?

13:15.545 --> 13:17.536
Hey, kid, I gotta run.
I gotta check on a lead.

13:17.631 --> 13:18.962
You okay to stay here longer?

13:19.883 --> 13:21.384
I'll call you later.

13:28.392 --> 13:29.598
Where are you really going?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.102
I told you. I'm following a lead.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.183
What lead?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.056
lt's myjob, it's complicated.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.808
Is this about
the person who killed my dad?

13:36.650 --> 13:37.685
Yes.

13:37.776 --> 13:39.061
Then tell me.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.358
It would just be easier
once it's all solved, Henry.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.609
You've been lying to me
ever since we got here.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.357
I deserve to know everything.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.067
No, you don't.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.902
I'm your mother and I know best.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.785
So you're just gonna have to deal with
this for now, okay? Understood?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.253
Yeah, yeah, I think I do.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.916
Wait.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.673
l... I need your keys.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.840
I left mine in the room,

14:04.928 --> 14:07.385

I'd like to have my Game Boy.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.416
Uh, nowhere.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.960
You are in quite the rush to go nowhere.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.130
Fine. I'm going home.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.627
Hmm.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.302
You were running away.

(SIGHS)

14:54.978 --> 14:56.013
Whatever.

14:56.104 --> 14:59.392
So you're planning on driving
all the way back to New York?

14:59.483 --> 15:01.724
One lesson
and you think you're ready for that.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.934
No, just to the nearest bus station.

15:04.446 --> 15:07.028
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
It's too dangerous.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.942
I don't care what you think.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.444
Well, you should.

15:12.329 --> 15:13.694
Because I've got a better way.

15:24.299 --> 15:26.290

15:27.052 --> 15:30.510
Because after true love there is
no more powerful magic than footwear.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.004
It has to be protected.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.677

-No. I don't think it's here.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.016

15:36.144 --> 15:37.725
Maybe it's in this thing.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.397
(GROANS)
Some winter coats, some scarfs.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.393
But the book is not in here.

15:47.697 --> 15:48.686
(SIGHS)

15:49.074 --> 15:50.860
Hang on. Let me check.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.707
I don't understand.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.455
Can I see that?

16:06.550 --> 16:09.667
I know there are chapters on Oz in here.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.594
I want to know whose heart
Zelena crushed to enact this curse.

16:13.557 --> 16:17.345
Because if there's something she loved,
that's her weakness.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.185
Did you really not see it in there?

16:25.861 --> 16:28.398
-You think I'm lying?
-No. Of course not. ltjust...

16:30.532 --> 16:31.647
Emma, what is going on?

16:31.741 --> 16:33.697
You've been anxious
since we left Granny's.

16:33.785 --> 16:34.865
Nothing.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.911
No, it's not nothing.
You yelled at Henry. That's not like you.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.200
None of this is like me.
Or at least, it never used to be.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.785
What are you talking about?

16:41.918 --> 16:45.502
I'm talking about wicked witches
and time traveling holy wars.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.750
I'd forgotten what it was like here.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.916
I don't want that for Henry.

16:52.596 --> 16:56.259
So you're taking him back to New York
after this is all over, aren't you?

16:56.725 --> 16:59.592
Your father said
you were thinking about it.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.101
Yeah, I am.

17:02.314 --> 17:05.272
And that is why you looked relieved
when we couldn't find the book.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.356
You don't want his memories back.

17:07.444 --> 17:09.981
If getting his memories back
is the only way to break the curse,

17:10.113 --> 17:11.774
then that's what we're gonna do.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.441
But I don't want it to be
any harder on him than it has to be.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.026
Our life in New York was really good.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.578
I'm sure it was, but it wasn't home.

17:21.917 --> 17:22.997
It was for us.

17:23.126 --> 17:25.333
Well, that's because
you forgot about us.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.298

17:50.153 --> 17:52.394
We're at the edge of the dark forest,

17:52.489 --> 17:53.899
trying to find the one person

17:53.990 --> 17:57.824
who can stop our imminent doom
and save your unborn child,

17:57.953 --> 18:00.285
and you two stop to smell the roses?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.037

18:04.960 --> 18:07.451
I don't care if they're dancing daffodils.

18:07.545 --> 18:10.207
I need to destroy my sister.

18:10.340 --> 18:11.500
And so do you.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.672
If that babbling mad man sent us
on a wild-goose chase, I swear...

18:18.682 --> 18:20.547
What's that supposed to be?

18:20.684 --> 18:23.721
Well, it appears to be a door.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.351
That leads to nowhere.

may pass through my door.

I know who you are.

19:33.256 --> 19:35.588
I've heard many tales of your bravery.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.584
And now you hold
not one pure heart but two.

19:38.803 --> 19:41.010
I sense powerful magic there.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.428
That's why we're here.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.798
We were told your light magic
could help defeat the Wicked Witch.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.595
We've come to ask for your help.

19:46.895 --> 19:51.138
I'm sorry. My magic is not
powerful enough to defeat Zelena.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.775
It never has been.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.728
You know her.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.233
We were friends long ago,
when things were different.

20:00.492 --> 20:04.235
But she made her choice.
She gave in to her dark magic.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.613
I tried to stop her. I failed.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.622
There must be some way to defeat her.

20:09.751 --> 20:10.991
There is.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.077
She was born with great power.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.335
Long ago I gave her a pendant
to help focus it.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.425
Her magic has resided inside of it
ever since.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.172
So if we can remove it,

20:22.305 --> 20:24.261
she'll lose her power,
and we can defeat her?

20:24.349 --> 20:25.429
Yes.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.849
But only a purveyor
of the strongest light magic

20:27.977 --> 20:29.968
will be able to accomplish such a feat.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.470
Light magic?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.188
Magic created from love.

20:35.110 --> 20:38.147

20:38.279 --> 20:40.361
She's the product of true love.
She's the Savior.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.859
If she is as pure and powerful
as you say,

20:42.992 --> 20:46.655
then, yes, she, and only she,
can defeat Zelena.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.283
But she's not in this land.

20:49.374 --> 20:51.706
And we can't get back to her.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.372
Well, then,
I'm afraid your quest is futile.

20:54.504 --> 20:56.711
Actually, there is a way.

20:58.174 --> 21:00.506
But there's a steep price.

21:00.635 --> 21:02.842
-No, Snow, you can't mean...
-Yes.

21:03.847 --> 21:06.054
We must enact the Dark Curse.

21:11.521 --> 21:13.512
Are you out of your minds?

21:14.149 --> 21:16.515
Even if! believed this Glinda,
which I don't,

21:16.985 --> 21:18.316
to cast the Dark Curse,

21:18.403 --> 21:20.314
I'd have to destroy the heart
of the thing I love most.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.566
Which, for me, is Henry.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.735
There has to be another way to enact it.

21:25.034 --> 21:28.697
If there were, do you think
I would have killed my own father?

21:30.582 --> 21:33.824
What about a magic bean?
If we had one, we could open a portal.

21:33.918 --> 21:34.998
Or Jefferson's hat.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.826
There are no more portals.

21:37.255 --> 21:40.918
Not for us.
Not for anyone the curse brought back.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.542
When I undid the first curse
to escape Pan, to bring us here,

21:44.679 --> 21:47.887
it divided our realms.
It placed a wall between them.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.601
So the Dark Curse is the only way.

21:50.768 --> 21:53.726
Haven't you been listening?
I can't cast it.

21:55.398 --> 21:56.899
But someone else can.

21:57.734 --> 21:58.689
Who?

21:58.776 --> 21:59.765
You.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.812
It's the only way.
You can use my heart to cast the curse.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.238
We have to think of our child.

22:05.366 --> 22:08.073
Our child needs you. I need you.

22:09.204 --> 22:12.287
We'll find another way.
We always find another way.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.399

22:42.487 --> 22:44.352
I've seen the movie a million times.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.563
It's quite a common name
in the seafaring world.

and would be happy for the company.

get the lad to the boathouse.

Take the boy there. Far exit.
Find a new boat.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.537
I'll stay here
to deal with our winged friends.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.378

And why does he have a sword?

It's all gonna make sense in a minute,

You were right.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.723
You deserve to know the truth.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.386
About fairy tales? I don't understand.

24:41.522 --> 24:42.557
Do you trust me?

24:43.274 --> 24:44.889
Yes, of course I do.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.100
Then I need you to believe.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.689
Believe in what?

24:50.740 --> 24:52.105
Believe in magic.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.284
From a book?

24:56.913 --> 24:58.699
It's more than just a book.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.084
Do you believe in me?

25:04.087 --> 25:05.418
Yes.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.205
Then take it.

-Yeah.

I'm so sorry to interrupt.

Now who wants to say goodbye first?

26:13.489 --> 26:15.229

Don't blame me. The Captain failed me.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.203
Damn you, Zelena.

26:30.339 --> 26:31.465
Hook, what is she talking about?

26:31.549 --> 26:34.006
He knew
what the price of that failure was.

There has to be
another way to get to Emma.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.514
There isn't.

I'd have gone back to Henry.

enact Rumple's Dark Curse

30:39.422 --> 30:40.912

about his sacrifice.

41:14.890 --> 41:16.972
EMMA: He was, Henry.

41:17.059 --> 41:20.551
He didn't give a second thought
to sacrificing himself for you.

41:20.687 --> 41:22.223
For all of us.

41:36.745 --> 41:37.780
Was it hard,

41:38.955 --> 41:42.243
coming back to Storybrooke
when you knew it'd be dangerous?

41:44.252 --> 41:47.039
I mean, life in New York
was pretty good.

41:47.631 --> 41:49.246
It was better than good.

41:50.592 --> 41:54.426
But I had this voice stuck in my head
that I couldn't shake.

41:54.554 --> 41:55.509
VVhose?

41:55.597 --> 41:56.712
Yours.

41:58.892 --> 42:00.883
I knew how you would've voted on this.

42:01.770 --> 42:02.930
Yeah,

42:03.980 --> 42:06.016
-and you know what this means?
-Hmm?

42:06.108 --> 42:07.814
Operation Cobra is back on.

42:09.903 --> 42:11.564
-I'm not sure it ever ended.
-(MARY WAILS)

42:12.197 --> 42:13.186
Hey...

42:13.281 --> 42:15.192
-EMMA: Mary Margaret!
-Hey. Hey.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.865
Deep breaths. Take deep breaths.
I'll get the truck.

42:17.953 --> 42:20.285
-Mary Margaret, are you okay?
-|t's the baby.

42:20.789 --> 42:22.279
It's coming.
