’Hi, cousin!’

01:36.730 --> 01:40.100
I just baked a big batch of
bang‐bong binki‐ninki baklava.

01:41.234 --> 01:43.336
"Bang‐bong binki‐ninki baklava?"

01:43.369 --> 01:44.370
Bingo!

01:45.539 --> 01:47.273
Want a big bite, booby?

01:48.308 --> 01:49.475
Better not, buddy.

01:51.512 --> 01:52.513
Bummer.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.148
Bitter, Balki?

01:55.181 --> 01:57.317
You bet your bibbi‐babkas
I’m bitter, baby.

01:59.753 --> 02:03.557
I broke my butt baking
these itty‐bitty binki‐ninkis.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.458
And believe me,
I banked on a bit

02:05.491 --> 02:07.460
of basic brotherly bolstering.

02:07.493 --> 02:09.229
Balki, buddy, baby.

02:10.229 --> 02:12.165
I’ve had a lot on my mind.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.336
Wainwright gave me
a very tough assignment.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.404
I’ve gotta do a
"Whatever Happened To" piece

02:18.438 --> 02:20.173
on Ace Atkins.

02:20.206 --> 02:22.208
Oh, I’d love
to know where he is.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.177
I’d love to know who he is.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.413
"Alvin ’Ace’ Atkins.

02:27.447 --> 02:29.482
"Highly decorated
Korean war pilot.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.718
"After the war,
he became a test pilot.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.221
"Currently owner and operator
of an air charter company

02:35.255 --> 02:37.223
and a Mr. Softee
ice cream franchise."

02:38.725 --> 02:41.327
Wow, cousin, you’re good!

02:41.361 --> 02:44.230
Can you find out whatever
happened to Mr. T?

02:44.264 --> 02:46.399
"I pity the fool!
I pity the fool!"

02:48.401 --> 02:51.872
Well, before I do that,
I’ve gotta finish this story.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.274
Wainwright wants me to go up
in Ace’s plane tomorrow

02:54.307 --> 02:56.276
so I can do a first‐hand account

02:56.309 --> 02:57.711
of what it’s like
to fly with him.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.312
[gasps]
Cousin, cousin, cousin!

02:59.345 --> 03:00.446
Please! Can I go?

03:00.480 --> 03:01.915
Please take me
to the friendly skies!

03:01.948 --> 03:03.850
Balki is ready when you are.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.186
I love to fly and it shows.

03:08.722 --> 03:09.856
Well, you can go if you want.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.992
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

03:12.025 --> 03:15.295
You can tell me what it was like
’cause I won’t be there.

03:15.328 --> 03:17.330
Cousin, how you can write
an article about flying

03:17.363 --> 03:18.832
with Ace unless
you fly with Ace?

03:18.865 --> 03:20.601
Balki, I’m a writer.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.469
I don’t have to experience
something to write about it.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.338
I wrote a very
comprehensive article

03:25.371 --> 03:26.907
about the sexual revolution.

03:28.975 --> 03:31.545
I think you owe your readers
a little more than that.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.547
Cousin, you have
to go up in that plane.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.281
Balki, I don’t like
small planes.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.384
They tend to fall out
of the sky.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.353
Cousin, it’s your duty
as a journalist.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.922
Ted Koppel would go.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.790
Sam Donaldson would go.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.592
Clark Kent would go.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.994
Of course he wouldn’t
need a plane, but...

03:48.028 --> 03:50.396
Balki, you can’t change my mind.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.567
Nothing you can do or say will
make me go up in that airplane.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.335
I’ll tell Jennifer
you sleep with a night light.

[Larry screaming]

04:18.591 --> 04:21.427
Whoa! Now, see there?

04:21.461 --> 04:24.598
That particular move
is the reason for the invention

04:24.631 --> 04:25.966
of the air sickness bag.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.536
Can you tell me
why the white zone

04:29.570 --> 04:31.772
is for loading
and unloading passengers only?

04:33.840 --> 04:35.909
Well, do we have to be
up so high?

04:35.942 --> 04:39.613
Oh, give me an airplane,
and an unlimited ceiling

04:39.646 --> 04:41.447
and I am a happy man.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.348
[chuckles]

04:42.382 --> 04:44.885
Give me a flight
of stairs and a Slinky

04:44.918 --> 04:47.020
and I’m a happy man.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.455
You are not alone there,
my friend.

04:49.489 --> 04:51.892
[laughing]

04:54.094 --> 04:57.631
(man on radio)
’Tower calling
Nancy 7‐8‐3‐5 Romeo.’

04:57.664 --> 04:59.600
’Nancy 7‐8‐3‐5 Romeo,
come in, please.’

05:00.834 --> 05:02.335
Oh, shut up!

05:02.368 --> 05:03.737
[laughs]

05:03.770 --> 05:06.439
Who, who was that,
the automatic pilot?

05:06.472 --> 05:08.675
Nah, it’s them jerks
in the tower.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.811
Well, shouldn’t you answer that?
It might be important.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.580
Nah, they’re all bent out
of shape ’cause I didn’t follow

05:13.614 --> 05:14.615
a flight plan.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.552
Hey, I don’t know where
I’m goin’, why should they?

05:18.585 --> 05:20.120
[laughing]

05:20.153 --> 05:22.122
We’re flying with a lunatic!

05:22.155 --> 05:24.490
Say, would you like to fly?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.860
I would love to fly!

05:26.893 --> 05:29.029
But I’m not sure I have
the upper body strength.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.932
I mean the plane.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.399
‐"The plane?"
‐Yes.

05:33.433 --> 05:35.401
I would love to fly the plane!

05:35.435 --> 05:36.870
Hold it, Balki!

05:36.903 --> 05:39.640
I’m sure it’s probably
against FAA regulations

05:39.673 --> 05:42.075
for anybody but Ace
to fly his plane.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.078
Oh, there’s too damn many
of them rules

05:45.111 --> 05:46.780
and regulations, if you ask me.

05:46.813 --> 05:49.816
I mean, if a man wants to fly,
we should let him fly.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.386
So he fails a couple of ’em
psychological tests, who cares?

05:53.419 --> 05:55.722
Look at me, do I look unstable?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.991
[laughing]

05:58.024 --> 05:59.993
Not at all. Well, I think
I’ve got enough

06:00.026 --> 06:01.427
for my article anyway.

06:01.461 --> 06:02.663
Why don’t we call it a day?

06:02.696 --> 06:05.766
Not before we have us some fun.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.534
[screaming]

06:10.937 --> 06:14.841
Ooh, don’t you just love it
when all the blood is rushing

06:14.875 --> 06:17.711
to your head, and you’re just
this close to blackin’ out?

06:17.744 --> 06:18.912
[laughs]

06:18.945 --> 06:22.816
Hey, have you ever tried hanging
upside down, spinning around

06:22.849 --> 06:25.919
drinking a cold soda
real fast while blindfolded?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.088
‐Oh, I love that!
‐Oh!

06:28.121 --> 06:31.057
Have you ever held your breath
and put your head

06:31.091 --> 06:32.092
in a tub of Jell‐O?

06:32.893 --> 06:36.062
Pull this plane up now!

06:36.096 --> 06:38.198
Oh, don’t get your
shorts in a bunch!

06:38.231 --> 06:40.033
I’ve got everything
under control.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.637
Wo‐oh.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.573
Looks like we got us
a situation here.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.875
I can’t seem to pull her
out of the dive.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.844
[dramatic music]

06:52.245 --> 06:53.814
We’re gonna have to bail out.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.015
[screams]

06:59.786 --> 07:01.522
Cousin, cousin, cousin, come on.

07:01.555 --> 07:03.123
It’s going to be fun,
we get to, we get to

07:03.156 --> 07:04.958
jump out of an airplane.

07:04.991 --> 07:06.527
There’s a couple
of chutes stowed

07:06.560 --> 07:08.228
in that box behind that seat.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.230
Just put ’em on,
jump outta the plane

07:10.263 --> 07:12.899
count to three,
and pull this here doohickey.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.968
‐Okay.
‐Well...

07:15.001 --> 07:17.704
I’ll see you boys on the ground.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.774
At which time,
I will give you both

07:20.807 --> 07:25.211
a valuable coupon
worth five cents toward purchase

07:25.245 --> 07:28.481
of any Mr. Softee item.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.584
Wait, wait, wait.
W‐wait, wait.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.453
‐No, no, no.
‐Oh, not good on Saturdays.

07:41.061 --> 07:44.831
Uh, uh, pu‐pull the doohickey,
uh, jump, then count to three.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.801
No! Uh, Balki,
I don’t remember what he said!

07:47.834 --> 07:50.236
He said the coupon’s
not good on Saturday.

07:51.237 --> 07:52.906
The parachutes!

07:52.939 --> 07:54.975
I don’t remember what he
said about the parachutes!

07:55.008 --> 07:56.977
‐There are no parachutes.
‐What?

07:57.010 --> 08:00.881
Yeah, just a note that says,
"Borrowed a couple of chutes.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.083
Hope you don’t mind.
Dave."

08:05.018 --> 08:06.753
[Larry whimpers]

08:08.021 --> 08:10.156
"Hope you don’t mind?"

08:10.190 --> 08:12.559
No, I don’t mind, actually
I prefer the front seat.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.595
Balki!

08:15.929 --> 08:18.064
Cousin, I‐I guess we’re going
to have to land

08:18.098 --> 08:19.700
the plane ourselves.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.802
What are you doing?
You can’t fly this plane!

08:21.835 --> 08:23.804
Well, well, cousin,
how hard can it be?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.138
Mr. Ace said he could fly it

08:25.171 --> 08:26.907
with both eyes
tied behind his back.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.610
Oh. Oh. Oh.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.779
You see, cousin?

08:32.813 --> 08:34.881
I made us stop
falling out of the sky!

08:34.914 --> 08:37.551
Now, we are so happy,
we do the dance of joy!

08:37.583 --> 08:40.587
Balki, that’s not good enough!

08:40.621 --> 08:42.722
We’ve still got
to land this plane!

08:42.756 --> 08:46.026
Cousin, don’t take
your shorts out to brunch!

08:46.059 --> 08:47.894
While, while we were taking off

08:47.928 --> 08:49.730
and you were breathing
into that paper bag

08:49.763 --> 08:51.798
I watched everything
that Mr. Ace did.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.267
Now, if I can just
do it backwards

08:54.300 --> 08:55.902
maybe I can land the plane.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.605
Oh, my Lord, we’re gonna die!

08:58.639 --> 09:00.106
No, cousin,
we’re not going to die.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.308
I’m going to land the plane.
Now, now, let me think.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.078
The first thing he did,
he, he, he called the tower.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.880
Call the tower.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.982
Suck wind, bozos,
I’m bringing her in.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.017

[sighs]

09:24.898 --> 09:26.833
[panting]

09:26.867 --> 09:28.902
I never thought
I’d see this apartment again.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.337
Look at this apartment!
I love this apartment!

09:31.371 --> 09:32.706
[lips smacking]

09:34.207 --> 09:36.910
Look at this couch,
I love this couch!

09:38.178 --> 09:39.713
Cousin?

09:39.746 --> 09:41.782
Look at this hand,
I love this hand!

09:41.815 --> 09:43.249
[lips smacking]

09:43.283 --> 09:46.219
Look at that face!
I love that face!

09:46.252 --> 09:48.288
Cousin, cousin.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.725
You’ve kissed everything
from here to the airport.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.660
I don’t think that policeman
was that happy

09:53.694 --> 09:55.896
when you planted
one on his horse.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.233
Balki, I’m just happy
to be alive.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.668
Do you know what happened?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.369
One minute we were
headed for the ground

10:03.403 --> 10:06.640
and the next, you made
a three‐point landing.

10:06.673 --> 10:08.274
Somebody was lookin’ out
for us today.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.077
Of course!

10:11.111 --> 10:14.915
Oh, cousin, sometimes I can’t
see the forest through my knees.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.285
Teflonos was with us today!

10:20.954 --> 10:22.823
‐"Teflonos?"
‐Teflonos.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.658
The Myposian God of protection.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.664
Any relation to Levolos,
the God of window treatments?

10:33.233 --> 10:36.870
Scoff if you will, cousin,
but once Teflonos puts

10:36.903 --> 10:40.073
his protective,
non‐stick shield around you

10:40.106 --> 10:42.943
for the next phase of the moon,
you’re indestructible.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.210
Oh, cousin!

10:44.244 --> 10:45.979
I’ve always wondered
what it would be like

10:46.012 --> 10:47.981
to put my head
in a lion’s mouth!

10:48.014 --> 10:49.149
[grunts]

10:51.384 --> 10:54.154
Balki, there is
no such thing as Teflonos

10:54.187 --> 10:56.189
and if you put your head
in a lion’s mouth...

10:57.223 --> 10:59.225
...he’ll bite it off.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.127
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I am going upstairs

11:01.161 --> 11:03.463
to tell my fiance how close
I came to death today

11:03.496 --> 11:06.066
and while she is comforting me

11:06.099 --> 11:09.369
why don’t you try and get in
touch with "Realitos?"

11:18.144 --> 11:19.212
[door shuts]

11:25.385 --> 11:27.854
Teflonos, I know you’re with me.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.422
[chuckles]
So...

11:29.455 --> 11:31.291
[chuckles]
...here goes.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.093
[vase shattering]

11:33.126 --> 11:35.896
[laughing]

11:35.929 --> 11:37.397
This is going to be fun!

11:37.430 --> 11:38.765
[instrumental music]

11:46.139 --> 11:47.874
[whistling]

11:50.043 --> 11:52.178
Ow, ow, ow. Ooh, ooh!

11:52.212 --> 11:53.446
Ooh, ooh!

11:54.180 --> 11:56.416
Ah. Ah.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.751
[door opens]

12:00.120 --> 12:02.022
‐Good morning, cousin.
‐’Good morning, Balki.’

12:06.793 --> 12:07.794
Ah!

12:09.530 --> 12:11.431
You’re not still thinking
about putting your head

12:11.464 --> 12:12.866
in a lion’s mouth,
are you?

12:12.899 --> 12:14.868
Well, of course not,
don’t be ridiculous.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.038
The circus don’t come to town
for two months

12:18.071 --> 12:20.006
and I’m only indestructible
for one.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.777
Balki? Balki?

12:26.146 --> 12:27.480
[grunts]

12:27.514 --> 12:29.850
Balki...what are you doing?

12:31.518 --> 12:32.853
Bungee cords, cousin.

12:34.855 --> 12:37.991
I’m going to, to dive off
the fire escape

12:38.024 --> 12:40.126
and see how close
I can get to the ground

12:40.160 --> 12:42.929
without actually hitting it.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.531
Uh, uh, Balki, I‐I‐I have seen

12:44.565 --> 12:46.366
bungee cord jumping
on television.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.834
It is very dangerous.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.402
People have been killed
trying it.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.237
Well, they were foolish
to try it

12:51.271 --> 12:53.339
without Teflonos’ protection.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.542
Ah! No, no, no! Balki!

12:55.576 --> 12:57.110
[grunts]

12:57.143 --> 13:00.814
[panting]
Th‐this is insane!
You can’t do this!

13:00.847 --> 13:02.516
Well, cousin, you can’t stop me.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.284
No! No, no.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.019
No! No. No.

13:06.052 --> 13:09.122
[panting]
Alright, Balki, Balki.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.125
Listen to me. Listen to me.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.193
[panting]

13:13.226 --> 13:15.929
‐Ah!
‐You can’t do this!

13:15.962 --> 13:17.864
Well, cousin,
that’s where you’re wrong.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.433
[screaming]

13:28.308 --> 13:30.844
[screaming]

13:40.153 --> 13:42.556
[breathing heavily]

13:47.327 --> 13:48.595
Oh‐oh.

13:48.629 --> 13:50.831
[breathing heavily]

13:56.169 --> 13:58.839
[breathing heavily]

14:00.941 --> 14:02.142
What a rush!

14:04.077 --> 14:05.879
[breathing heavily]

14:17.290 --> 14:19.125
What a thrill!

14:20.226 --> 14:22.195
What an experience!

14:22.228 --> 14:24.430
I have never felt
anything like it

14:24.464 --> 14:26.332
before in my life!

14:26.366 --> 14:30.136
You’re falling and then suddenly

14:30.170 --> 14:32.005
fwing!

14:33.339 --> 14:35.275
You stop...

14:36.543 --> 14:39.212
...inches from certain death!

14:43.316 --> 14:47.020
That bungee cord shouldn’t have
been able to hold our weight

14:47.053 --> 14:48.388
but it did!

14:50.390 --> 14:53.059
[breathing heavily]

15:00.534 --> 15:01.535
Hm.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.940
[sighs]

15:06.973 --> 15:08.141
Oh!

15:10.677 --> 15:13.213
[breathing heavily]

15:14.447 --> 15:15.682
‐Uh...
‐Eeh...

15:15.716 --> 15:18.351
[grunting]
You know, Balki...

15:18.384 --> 15:20.721
[breathing heavily]
...that was incredible!

15:20.754 --> 15:22.022
Yeah, it sure was!

15:22.055 --> 15:25.425
That Teflonos knows how to show
you a good time, don’t he?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.561
Now, let me get this straight.

15:31.532 --> 15:33.667
[breathing heavily]

15:38.338 --> 15:41.341
For the next 28 days

15:41.374 --> 15:44.545
we can do anything we want
and not get hurt?

15:44.578 --> 15:46.112
Ah, that’s right, cousin.

15:46.146 --> 15:50.216
What death‐defying,
life‐threatening stunt

15:50.250 --> 15:52.285
is first on your list?

15:52.318 --> 15:53.720
Well, you know...

15:56.189 --> 15:58.491
I’ve always had
this secret desire

15:58.525 --> 16:01.361
to go right to the top
of the Sears Tower

16:01.394 --> 16:04.430
and go right ahead
and look down!

16:07.634 --> 16:10.771
Yeah, well, I‐I‐I can, I can see

16:10.804 --> 16:13.139
why that would be
a big step for you, cousin

16:13.173 --> 16:16.042
but while we’re
under Teflonos’ protection

16:16.076 --> 16:19.012
why you don’t think of something
a little more daring?

16:20.681 --> 16:23.016
Well, there is one thing
I’ve always wanted to do.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.218
No, I can’t, it’s ridiculous!

16:25.251 --> 16:27.120
Well, of course you can!

16:27.153 --> 16:29.422
Do be ridiculous!

16:29.455 --> 16:31.191
Balki, you’re right!

16:31.224 --> 16:32.559
Let’s do it!

16:32.593 --> 16:34.360
[grunting]

16:34.394 --> 16:36.362
[instrumental music]

16:36.396 --> 16:37.497
[engine revving]

16:40.133 --> 16:41.434
[screaming]

16:41.467 --> 16:43.604
[laughing]

16:44.805 --> 16:46.272
‐This’s just great!
‐Yeah.

16:46.306 --> 16:49.442
In fact, if it weren’t
for the bugs in my teeth

16:49.475 --> 16:51.745
I’d say this was the best time
I ever had!

16:51.778 --> 16:53.747
[laughing]

16:53.780 --> 16:56.650
‐Oh, Balki, I got a great idea.
‐What?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.484
Why don’t you drive for a while?

16:58.519 --> 17:00.320
That’s a great idea!

17:00.353 --> 17:03.256
[laughing]

17:03.289 --> 17:04.290
Well...

17:08.662 --> 17:10.664
[engine revving]

17:12.298 --> 17:13.534
[laughing]

17:20.574 --> 17:22.108
[engine revving]

17:23.777 --> 17:27.480
Cousin, cousin,
I love the new spontaneous you!

17:28.481 --> 17:29.750
What’s next on our list?

17:29.783 --> 17:31.451
Well, we’re scheduled

17:31.484 --> 17:33.654
to get shot out
of a cannon at 4:00

17:33.687 --> 17:34.788
but that might interfere

17:34.821 --> 17:37.257
with our swimming
with sharks at 5:00!

17:37.290 --> 17:39.225
Maybe we could get the cannon

17:39.259 --> 17:42.495
to shoot us into the shark pool!

17:42.529 --> 17:45.498
Great idea! But it has to be
at feeding time!

17:45.532 --> 17:46.700
Oh, yeah, right.

17:53.607 --> 17:56.109
‐A‐ha!
‐A‐ha!

17:56.142 --> 17:57.477
A‐ha!

18:00.146 --> 18:02.382
[engine revving]

18:02.415 --> 18:04.685
Cousin, I was thinking

18:04.718 --> 18:07.153
tomorrow might be
a good time for you

18:07.187 --> 18:10.390
to get over your fear
of small planes!

18:10.423 --> 18:12.258
Great idea!

18:12.292 --> 18:15.762
And the best way to do that is
for me to fly the plane myself!

18:15.796 --> 18:18.532
Cousin, you don’t know
how to fly a plane!

18:18.565 --> 18:21.702
Well, I don’t know how to drive
a motorcycle, either!

18:21.735 --> 18:23.904
That’s a good point,
very good point.

18:23.937 --> 18:25.872
‐Let’s hang two!
‐Okay.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.816
Well, what’s that sign say?

18:37.718 --> 18:41.387
‐Freeway ends in 300 feet.
‐Yes!

18:41.421 --> 18:42.556
[laughing]

18:42.589 --> 18:45.425
(both)
Yeah!

18:47.260 --> 18:48.562
(Larry)
’Ya‐hoo!’

18:48.595 --> 18:50.230
[both laughing]

18:52.265 --> 18:54.267
Cousin, that was great!

18:54.300 --> 18:56.302
You wanna go back
and buzz Wrigley Field again?

18:56.336 --> 18:58.471
Maybe this time
we can get the ball autographed.

18:58.505 --> 19:00.507
O‐okay, my turn!

19:01.441 --> 19:03.577
[both screaming]

19:03.610 --> 19:05.712
[both laughing]

19:05.746 --> 19:06.913
(Larry)
’Whee! Ooh!’

19:06.947 --> 19:09.616
[Larry laughing]

19:09.650 --> 19:10.751
‐Oh. Oh.
‐Wow!

19:10.784 --> 19:13.419
Ah, that was great!

19:13.453 --> 19:14.688
[laughing]

19:14.721 --> 19:16.523
[gasps]
Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:16.557 --> 19:17.691
‐’Oh!’
‐’Wow!’

19:17.724 --> 19:19.793
[laughing]

19:19.826 --> 19:22.362
Whoa! Nice maneuver, cousin.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.764
Uh. Oh, I thought you did that.

19:23.797 --> 19:25.298
Oh, no, no, that wasn’t me.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.867
‐I prefer more fluid movement.
‐Oh.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.603
More than that kind of
serpentine, uh, type of thing.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.237
Okay, well, pull her up.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.272
[chuckles]

19:35.308 --> 19:37.578
‐I can’t.
‐Just pull back on the stick.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.780
[dramatic music]

19:39.813 --> 19:41.615
I’m getting a strange feeling.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.349
Well, of course
you feel strange.

19:43.383 --> 19:46.419
We are headed at the ground
at an enormous rate of speed

19:46.452 --> 19:49.990
but we are safe,
thanks to good ol’ Teflonos.

19:50.023 --> 19:52.325
[chuckles]
Just pull her out of this.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.995
Cousin, I’m trying,
but good ol’ Teflonos

19:55.028 --> 19:56.663
ain’t doin’ diddly.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.833
Oh, my God!

19:59.866 --> 20:01.602
What if we’re not
indestructible anymore?

20:01.635 --> 20:03.303
Well, Balki,
that’s not possible.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.506
You told me
we’d be protected for 28 days

20:05.539 --> 20:06.673
and it’s only been a week.

20:06.707 --> 20:07.808
Yeah, but, but maybe

20:07.841 --> 20:09.342
Teflonos don’t have enough power

20:09.375 --> 20:11.244
to protect two people.

20:11.277 --> 20:13.346
May‐maybe, he can only
take care of one of us.

20:13.379 --> 20:14.915
Cousin, if I leave,
you’ll be saved.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.250
No, no, Ba‐Balki, don’t do this!

20:17.283 --> 20:18.418
But, cousin,
it’s our only chance!

20:18.451 --> 20:19.786
W‐w‐wa‐who... Whoa!

20:19.820 --> 20:22.656
S‐suppose Teflonos decides
to protect you

20:22.689 --> 20:24.991
I’m gonna hit the ground
like an overripe cantaloupe!

20:26.727 --> 20:29.262
Teflonos, if you can hear me

20:29.295 --> 20:30.897
I want you to stay
with Cousin Larry.

20:32.866 --> 20:34.500
Goodbye, cousin.

20:34.535 --> 20:36.036
Oh, no. No, no, no!
No. Uh, Balki.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.938
Well, no, wait.
Wait, wait, Balki.

20:37.971 --> 20:41.007
Balki. Oh. Balki.
Don’t do this! Balki. Balki.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.543
Oh, no. No.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.844
Hey, Balki!

20:44.545 --> 20:45.846
Sorry, cousin!

20:47.380 --> 20:49.883
I guess Teflonos decided
to stay with me!

20:49.916 --> 20:51.852
See you on the ground!

20:56.957 --> 20:58.925
You can wake up.
It‐it’s alright, it’s alright.

20:58.959 --> 21:00.293
Where am I?

21:01.494 --> 21:04.330
Why are you beating me up?

21:04.364 --> 21:06.667
Cousin, we’re,
we’re in Mr. Ace’s plane, okay?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.602
And, and‐and, uh...

21:08.635 --> 21:11.471
we went into a dive
and, and you fainted.

21:11.505 --> 21:13.974
Yeah, you passed out
before I could tell you

21:14.007 --> 21:17.511
I was just kidding about
that bailin’ out business.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.079
Well, that’s your idea
of a joke?

21:19.112 --> 21:22.348
Now, you see, that’s
the trouble with you civilians.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.350
You ain’t got no sense of humor.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.052
Just like them tough butts
at NASA.

21:26.086 --> 21:27.954
You mean, you didn’t bail out?

21:27.988 --> 21:30.023
B‐Balki didn’t land the plane?

21:30.056 --> 21:32.458
We didn’t drive a motorcycle?

21:32.492 --> 21:35.095
I don’t think Cousin Larry is
playing with a full deck chair.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.329
No.

21:38.699 --> 21:41.568
It must have been a dream.
Why, it seemed so real!

21:41.602 --> 21:44.738
Balki, we did things
you wouldn’t believe!

21:44.771 --> 21:46.472
Well, Mr. Ace says
he can do some things

21:46.507 --> 21:47.407
you wouldn’t believe.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.810
’He says he can do
a loop‐de‐loop’

21:49.843 --> 21:53.113
that makes almost all the blood
go below your knees.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.649
‐Show him, Mr. Ace.
‐Alright!

21:55.682 --> 21:56.883
‐No. No, no.
‐Whoa!

21:56.917 --> 21:59.586
[all screaming]

22:02.856 --> 22:04.725
[instrumental music]

22:13.800 --> 22:16.670
Well, cousin, except for
the screaming and the fainting

22:16.703 --> 22:18.639
you had fun.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.841
I guess you’ve gotten over
your fear of small planes.

22:20.874 --> 22:22.743
Balki, I’m never going up
in a small plane again.

22:22.776 --> 22:23.877
I guess I was wrong.

22:23.910 --> 22:25.679
[sighing]

22:25.712 --> 22:29.415
You know, sometimes
a little fear is a good thing.

22:29.449 --> 22:30.984
I’m going to bed now.

22:32.686 --> 22:34.087
[sighs]

22:34.120 --> 22:36.690
You know, tomorrow
after I finish my article

22:36.723 --> 22:38.158
I’m going to spend
the rest of the day

22:38.191 --> 22:40.426
enjoying some nice, safe

22:40.460 --> 22:43.496
non‐life‐threatening
leisure activity.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.999
[chuckles]
Cousin, cousin.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.701
Here’s something you might like.

22:47.734 --> 22:51.171
"Bungee jumping.
Take the plunge."

22:51.204 --> 22:52.973
‐Uh, may I see that?
‐Oh, sure.

22:53.006 --> 22:54.841
Oh. Uh...

22:54.875 --> 22:55.676
[sighs]

22:57.644 --> 22:59.479
‐Thank you.
‐You’re most welcome.

22:59.513 --> 23:02.382
[theme music]

23:08.555 --> 23:10.757
[theme music]

23:29.042 --> 23:31.912
[music continues]
