is The Ghost?

00:09.879 --> 00:12.316
Some psychotic bomb maker
Mac tangled with a while back.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.231
Killed Mac's EOD mentor

If there's anything we can use

00:18.366 --> 00:20.324

I'll find it.

I know you will, Charlie.

CHARLIE:

00:27.766 --> 00:29.377
Detonation bolt
on that last device

00:29.420 --> 00:32.075

but I will live.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.164
MAN :
We're pinned down.
Need air support.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.688
We found another device.
Another IED.

Nothing underneath.

built with finger joints,
no visible fasteners,

and a hinge lid.

Definitely an IED.

Let's see...

01:57.726 --> 01:59.249
Whoever built this is using

01:59.293 --> 02:01.556
antique clocks
as a drive mechanism.

02:06.082 --> 02:08.650
This sucker's powerful, too.
Look at that.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.522
That's enough explosive
to vaporize this entire block.

02:11.566 --> 02:14.308
I've never seen craftsmanship
like this before, Mac.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.179

he's good.

He's one of the best

02:34.154 --> 02:36.547
I want to talk tonight about...

02:36.591 --> 02:40.203
what it felt like to be
in the bottom of a dark hole...

02:40.247 --> 02:42.336
and what it took to come out.

02:42.379 --> 02:45.121
I want to talk
about the warrior ethos

02:45.165 --> 02:49.212
and the moment I decided
that the event that broke me

02:49.256 --> 02:51.823
would not get the best of me.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.394
Thank you.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.309
Oh, did you want
another beer?

02:59.353 --> 03:00.745
Wha... Um, yeah.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.094
Or no. I-I'm...

03:02.138 --> 03:03.226
I don't know.

03:03.270 --> 03:05.663
Sorry, I am...

03:05.707 --> 03:08.144
in my head over here.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.494
You know you can talk
to me about anything.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.325
Me and Nasha are
taking time apart.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.284
Sorry to hear that, Mac.

03:17.327 --> 03:19.851
Yeah, well, me, too.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.115
I just don't want her to be in
danger because of me anymore.

03:23.159 --> 03:27.032
After Murdoc, I think it's
the best thing for her.

03:27.076 --> 03:30.601
Well, maybe what you should be
asking is what's best for you?

03:33.300 --> 03:37.304
Maybe, in our line of work, we
just don't get to have that.

03:38.696 --> 03:40.132
Yeah.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.223
I'm gonna run these

Mm, powerful night.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.949
Very.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.212
Let me guess.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.257
Army.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.129
Nailed it. First try.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.391
You serve?

04:21.435 --> 04:23.350
I'm British intelligence.

04:23.393 --> 04:26.309
I was in Afghanistan
for a spell.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.877
British intelligence
with an American accent?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.313
Your drink, ma'am.

04:30.357 --> 04:34.099
Mm. I moved to England
when I was a little girl.

04:34.143 --> 04:38.234
But it is hard to shake off
sounding like a Yank.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.410
When were you
in Afghanistan?

04:40.454 --> 04:43.283
Same as you. 2011.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.416
I know.

04:46.460 --> 04:49.332
You were Army EOD
stationed in Gardez.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.422
How did you know all that?Meeting you here isn't
an accident, MacGyver.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.337
I came looking for you.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.557
We have something in common.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.341
The Ghost killed people we love.

04:58.385 --> 05:00.561
Ghost?

05:00.604 --> 05:02.650
I know where he is, right now.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.913
We have a chance
to go get him,

05:04.956 --> 05:06.697
but I need your help.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.308
MATTY:
Okay, Ms. Brennan,

05:08.351 --> 05:10.571
I verified
your credentials.

05:10.614 --> 05:12.355
Born in Ohio,
you moved to London

05:12.399 --> 05:14.401
with your parents
as a child,

05:14.444 --> 05:16.490
became a naturalized
British citizen,

05:16.533 --> 05:18.361
joined military
intelligence,

05:18.405 --> 05:20.755
and you have a jacket
full of tours,

05:20.798 --> 05:23.323
in Afghanistan,
Syria and the Congo.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.412
You are who
you say you are.

05:25.455 --> 05:27.414
But what you haven't told us
is why your outfit

05:27.457 --> 05:29.154
isn't acting on this intel.

05:29.198 --> 05:30.373
My bosses feel
the evidence they have

05:30.417 --> 05:32.027
is too thin to sanction an op.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.245
So...

05:33.289 --> 05:35.073
I took a leave of absence
and came here

05:35.117 --> 05:36.771
to find MacGyver
and ask for his help.

05:36.814 --> 05:38.338
I've been studying
The Ghost for years.

05:38.381 --> 05:41.471
I believe he's freelanced as
a bomb maker in Baghdad, London,

05:41.515 --> 05:42.820
Belfast, Spain's Basque region

05:42.864 --> 05:45.083
and a dozen other hot spots
around the world.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.347
That does line up with
what we know about him.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.044
Tracking his bomb history
is how I learned

05:49.087 --> 05:50.437
about the death
of your EOD instructor,

05:50.480 --> 05:52.439
Alfred Pena,

05:52.482 --> 05:55.006
the massive bomb you
disarmed at the U.N. and...

05:55.050 --> 05:57.661
the even bigger one The Ghost
planted in your home a year ago.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.359
That's when
I realized,

05:59.402 --> 06:03.145
if The Ghost came all the way
to L.A. to try and kill you,

06:03.188 --> 06:04.755
he knows you're a threat.

06:04.799 --> 06:08.237
And anyone who scares The Ghost
is someone I need right now.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.456
RILEY:
Okay,

06:09.499 --> 06:10.892
but every intel agency
in the world

06:10.935 --> 06:12.415
has been tracking
The Ghost for years.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.764
No luck.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.418
We don't know anything
about him,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.551
yet you have his exact location?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.335
I believe the Russian
military captured him

06:19.379 --> 06:20.815
with a group of
Chechen rebels.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.904
The Russians stuck The Ghost
in a military installation

06:22.947 --> 06:24.514
completely unaware
that they had

06:24.558 --> 06:26.037
one of the best
bomb makers in the history

06:26.081 --> 06:27.299
of modern warfare
in custody.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.171
MATTY:
Okay, Ms. Brennan,
I would love

06:29.214 --> 06:30.781
to green-light
a capture op right now,

06:30.825 --> 06:33.784
but how could you be so sure
the Russians have The Ghost?

06:35.395 --> 06:38.876
My contact managed to smuggle
a recording of an interrogation

06:38.920 --> 06:41.183
out of the Russian
military installation.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.446
MAN :
I am no one.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.143

just some vampire.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.416
This is Dracula himself.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.375
How can you be sure
that's his voice?

07:00.332 --> 07:01.856
Because it's the voice I heard

07:01.899 --> 07:05.599
right before one of The Ghost's
bombs killed my parents.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.385
Well, Jack's gonna be pissed
he was sent to Brazil

07:09.429 --> 07:11.431
to clean up that
smuggling ring;

07:11.474 --> 07:12.736
he would've wanted
a piece of this guy.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.564
So you dothink
she found The Ghost?

07:14.608 --> 07:16.697
Well, we have no confirmed
recording to compare it to,

07:16.740 --> 07:18.133
so I can't be sure.

07:18.176 --> 07:20.962
But... I can see
she's convinced.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.485
I don't know
if that's enough to sanction

07:22.529 --> 07:23.486

10:56.743 --> 10:58.005
of the Russian base.

10:58.048 --> 11:00.181
Now there's two vehicles
heading right for you.

11:00.224 --> 11:01.835
Guys, get to cover.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.751
♪

11:11.061 --> 11:13.977
You should have visual in three,
two...

11:33.040 --> 11:34.955
Cover!

11:35.825 --> 11:37.305
Eileen!

11:37.348 --> 11:38.698
No. Get down!

11:46.836 --> 11:48.229
CHARLIE:
Mac!

11:48.272 --> 11:51.188
I got a bag full of devices
back here. Every type.

11:54.191 --> 11:56.019
These guys came
loaded for bear.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.194
We got a survivor in here.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.766
Put him down right there.

12:05.246 --> 12:06.464
Eileen, you said

12:06.508 --> 12:07.770
The Ghost was here working
with Chechen rebels.

12:07.814 --> 12:09.859
Think that's
who broke him out?

12:12.340 --> 12:13.820
It wasn't the Chechens.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.647
That's Patrick Quinn,
a member of the IRA.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.606
IRA?
RILEY: If the IRA
came all the way

12:17.649 --> 12:18.694
to Chechnya
to get The Ghost out...

12:18.738 --> 12:19.956
It means they're
working with him.

12:21.044 --> 12:22.219
Then The Ghost is

12:22.263 --> 12:23.525
in the wind.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.750
MacGYVER:
I'm willing to bet

12:30.793 --> 12:33.013
The Ghost will not be
in Chechnya for very long.

12:33.056 --> 12:36.451
Which means we need
to get you talking fast.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.582
All right, Patrick,

12:37.626 --> 12:39.323
tell us where you
were taking The Ghost,

12:39.367 --> 12:41.630
or I'll hand you over
to the Russians.

12:41.673 --> 12:43.980
Yeah, bet they'll be real
excited to meet the man

12:44.024 --> 12:45.634
who just bombed one
of their army installations.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.946
[continues in
unknown language]

12:52.989 --> 12:55.252
I'm sorry, what was that?

12:55.296 --> 12:56.732
Elvish?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.127
It's Irish.Well, if he doesn't
speak English,

13:00.170 --> 13:01.563
it's gonna be hard to get

13:01.606 --> 13:02.607
any useful information
out of him.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.218
Oh, he speaks English.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.655
Patrick, I need you
to cooperate.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.222
We want to do this
the right way.

13:10.137 --> 13:14.010
Guys like this don't understand
the "right way."

13:17.579 --> 13:18.841
CHARLIE:
Eileen,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.712
careful--
I haven't disarmed those yet.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.540
I know.
How long would it take

13:22.584 --> 13:24.716
for you to disarm this
if it was triggered?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.154
Like, 30 seconds.
But what do you plan...

13:27.197 --> 13:30.374
Patrick, you're gonna tell me
where you were taking The Ghost.

13:33.464 --> 13:36.337
Or I'm gonna turn you
into puzzle pieces.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.734
All right, all right,
I'll talk, I'll talk!

13:42.778 --> 13:46.086
MATTY :
Phoenix agents picked up Quinn
where you left him.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.958
And I'm glad you were able
to disable that device, Mac.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.873
Not exactly standard
interrogation practice

13:50.917 --> 13:53.006
for the Phoenix.MacGYVER:
Nope.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.834
But it was effective.RILEY:
Yeah, but all he

13:54.877 --> 13:57.271
was able to tell us was
they were taking The Ghost

13:57.314 --> 13:58.794
to some warehouse
outside the city.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.274
Riley, how far out are you?

14:00.317 --> 14:01.492
20 minutes.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.756
I want everyone to know...

14:04.800 --> 14:07.237
I'm sorry for
back there.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.587
I understand your
organization doesn't condone

14:09.631 --> 14:11.763
that kind of behavior.
It's just...

14:14.549 --> 14:17.465
I was eight
when my parents died.

14:19.989 --> 14:22.818
My dad was an engineer, and
his job relocated us to London.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.560
You know, it was tough
for me and my mom to adjust,

14:25.603 --> 14:27.170
but we were making
the best of it.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.477
Then one day,

14:29.520 --> 14:32.741
I came home from school
and heard my parents arguing.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.788
So I just sat
by the door listening.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.268
And that is when a man

14:38.312 --> 14:41.924
started yelling in the hall
outside of our apartment.

14:41.968 --> 14:44.057
"Get out. Run."

14:46.711 --> 14:48.713
And then something exploded.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.802
I woke up in
the hospital.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.500
The British police

14:52.543 --> 14:55.329
had dragged me
out of the rubble,

14:55.372 --> 14:57.157
and I survived.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.901
But my parents didn't.

15:02.814 --> 15:04.860
And the man in the hall
yelling, "Get out"?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.644
It was The Ghost.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.386
British tests confirmed
the bomb was his.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.518
Why would The Ghost

15:10.561 --> 15:11.911
be targeting someone
in your building?

15:11.954 --> 15:13.434
I don't think he was.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.697
I think he was using
an apartment as his workshop.

15:15.740 --> 15:19.831
Oh, the British conducted raids
all over London that day.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.442
They thought The Ghost
had been hired

15:21.485 --> 15:23.052
to take out
a target in the city.

15:23.096 --> 15:26.055
Maybe The Ghost thought the
raids were getting too close.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.755
Maybe the bomb going off
was an accident.

15:33.149 --> 15:35.673
I know I crossed the line
earlier, and I am sorry.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.763
But I have
been obsessed

15:38.807 --> 15:40.722
with catching The Ghost
for so long,

15:40.765 --> 15:43.725
and to just watch him
slip away just...

15:45.031 --> 15:47.468
I know you understand obsession.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.775
Your mentor's death.

15:52.038 --> 15:54.779
It wasn't Pena's death

15:54.823 --> 15:56.825
that started my obsession
with The Ghost.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.783
Two weeks
before Pena was killed,

15:58.827 --> 16:01.873
one of The Ghost's
bombs went off,

16:01.917 --> 16:03.875
killing 12 innocent people.

16:03.919 --> 16:05.399
Six children.

16:05.442 --> 16:08.315
I had only been in-country
for three months, it was summer.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.708
We were getting calls
from all over the city.

16:10.752 --> 16:13.755
There were bombs... everywhere.

16:13.798 --> 16:17.280
Later, they called it
"The Day of 1,000 IEDs."

16:17.324 --> 16:19.500
MAN :
Got a small cylinder
on the floor by the window.

16:19.543 --> 16:20.588
Three more on the ceiling.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.982
Need EOD, ASAP.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.247
We've already
defused, what, 41?

16:27.290 --> 16:29.205
Yeah. And it's not like
these are your basic

16:29.249 --> 16:31.947
slap together,
look up on the Internet IEDs.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.862
They're far more advanced bombs
that anything we've seen

16:33.905 --> 16:36.256
here in Afghanistan.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.223
Hey, guys, we got this one.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.616
CHARLIE:
Must be a mix-up.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.270
I thought we were working
this section of Gardez.

16:50.313 --> 16:51.532
Probably our mistake.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.055
Going on 37
hours straight.

16:53.099 --> 16:55.579
Pulled a real nasty one
out of the curb earlier.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.668
Well, you want another
set of hands?

16:57.712 --> 16:59.801
MAN :
Cutter 29.

16:59.844 --> 17:00.889
We got two more IEDs.
Sector 11.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.065
Need you ASAP.
Troops taking fire.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.198
Mac, that's us.
You're right.

17:05.241 --> 17:07.069
Good luck, boys.

17:11.552 --> 17:12.944
MacGYVER:
A few hours later...

17:12.988 --> 17:16.905
a bomb went off
on that street...

17:16.948 --> 17:18.385
killing 12 innocent people.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.649
There must have been
a second device there,

17:21.692 --> 17:23.738
and that EOD team missed it.

17:27.307 --> 17:30.179
Mac and I set
a company record that night.

17:30.223 --> 17:33.269
126 devices defused.

17:33.313 --> 17:36.316
The one that went off...
that's the one we remember.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.850
RILEY:
This is the warehouse

17:48.893 --> 17:51.026
Quinn said they were
bringing The Ghost to.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.943
Everybody stay back, Charlie
and I will go... check for...

17:56.901 --> 17:58.338
What is it, Mac?

17:58.381 --> 17:59.904
The building is on fire.

17:59.948 --> 18:02.385
I can feel heat,
but I don't see any fire.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.865
It's a methanol fire.

18:03.908 --> 18:06.128
It burns blue. It's almost
invisible in the daylight.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.738
Invisible and nearly smokeless.

18:07.782 --> 18:10.959
No smoke means no one notices
and calls the fire department.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.830
The Ghost must be burning
whatever he left behind

18:12.874 --> 18:13.962
to cover his tracks.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.097
What is he doing?

18:23.058 --> 18:25.408
Fire needs oxygen to burn.

18:25.452 --> 18:29.020
The CO2 will force
the oxygen out of the room.

18:29.064 --> 18:31.675
RILEY:
He's making a path
through the fire.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.115
That's insane.That's MacGyver.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.903
:
He's burning barrels

19:25.947 --> 19:27.122
of industrial chemicals
in there.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.167
They could go up at any second.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.125
Get back,
I'm gonna get the bombs.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.001
These are shipping documents.

19:38.612 --> 19:40.527
They're sending thousands of
gallons of chemicals somewhere.

19:40.570 --> 19:42.790
The address has burned off
these pages.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.272
MacGYVER:
Paris.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.926
The Ghost is going to Paris.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.064
♪

20:01.852 --> 20:03.202
This is it.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.073
The location where The Ghost
shipped the chemicals.

20:05.116 --> 20:06.422
A machine shop?

20:06.466 --> 20:08.859
Bomb makers like to hide
their workshops in places

20:08.903 --> 20:10.339
where the sound of metal work

20:10.383 --> 20:12.559
and the smell of chemicals
won't seem out of place.

20:12.602 --> 20:15.997
Auto body shops, foundries,
chemical plants.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.520
But why Paris?
What's the target?

20:19.174 --> 20:20.828
That's what we need
to find out.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.965
BOZER: If this is where
The Ghost sent the chemicals,

20:28.009 --> 20:29.750
where are they?

20:29.793 --> 20:31.534
Even if they all were brought
here, they'd never fit.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.754
This building isn't big enough
to house all those barrels.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.451
RILEY: So, instead of
finding The Ghost,

20:35.495 --> 20:38.062
we find an abandoned building
and a dead end.

20:48.116 --> 20:51.032
You know, for a place
that's supposed to be abandoned,

20:51.075 --> 20:52.425
this room sure is clean.

20:52.468 --> 20:53.991
Where's all the dust?

20:54.035 --> 20:56.255
We're not leaving
any footprints.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.822
This floor's been swept.
Recently.

20:58.866 --> 21:02.043
Yeah, somebody's trying
to cover their tracks.

21:08.092 --> 21:09.529
BOZER:
Uh, Mac

21:14.969 --> 21:17.145
Listen. You hear that?

21:18.146 --> 21:19.060
What is that?

21:28.287 --> 21:30.550
That is where The Ghost
took the chemicals.

21:33.379 --> 21:35.337
RILEY:
This building sits over

21:35.381 --> 21:37.121
one of the main service tunnels
in the Paris catacombs.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.733
Riley, Bozer, call Paris police,
tell them what we found here.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.343
Then call Matty
and bring her up to speed.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.432
Eileen, Charlie, you're with me.

21:43.476 --> 21:44.955
Mac, Mac, you don't
know how long

21:44.999 --> 21:46.348
The Ghost has
been down there.

21:46.392 --> 21:49.351
He's had time to nest,
make traps.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.745
Need to make sure we're
prepared for anything.

22:11.504 --> 22:14.768
Okay, no chemical reaction.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.639
No trip wires, no
pressure plates.

22:16.683 --> 22:19.076
Hall is free of traps.CHARLIE: I know I watched you
build that thing,

22:19.120 --> 22:21.252
but I don't know what it does.

22:21.296 --> 22:22.471
It's called a comeback can.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.951
It's a simple
science experiment

22:23.994 --> 22:25.213
taught to kids
to explain the concepts

22:25.256 --> 22:26.867
of potential
and kinetic energy.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.956
CHARLIE: And now you're
using it to search for bombs

22:28.999 --> 22:31.001
from a safe distance.
That's ingenious, Mac.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.439
EILEEN:
And badass.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.092
BOZER:
Brought the police up to speed.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.703
They're calling in
additional units

22:36.746 --> 22:38.618
to start searching the city for
possible incendiary devices.

22:38.661 --> 22:42.056
How's it going down there?Slow.

22:42.099 --> 22:44.319
They have to be careful
looking for traps.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.234
These catacombs are massive.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.018
Spread out
under the entire city.

22:48.062 --> 22:49.672
The Ghost could be anywhere.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.514
Oh, got a reaction.

23:08.038 --> 23:10.780
Chemical particles in the air
down this hall.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.652
Everybody, move slow.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.480
Keep your eye open for traps.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.106
Wiring's new.

23:32.149 --> 23:33.934
Door is definitely rigged.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.258
After all these years, Mac.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.479
We finally found one
of his workshops.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.090
Yeah, but we still
haven't found him.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.309
Everybody, fan out.

24:01.352 --> 24:02.832
There may be evidence
of The Ghost's target

24:02.876 --> 24:05.313
down here somewhere.

24:09.535 --> 24:11.972
Mac, you're gonna
want to see this.

24:13.930 --> 24:16.280
All these discs are
labeled with names.

24:18.195 --> 24:20.415
MacGYVER:
These are all bomb techs.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.331
French, British, American.
I recognize the names.

24:23.374 --> 24:24.854
He's been studying them.

24:24.898 --> 24:27.335
Like an athlete studies
game film.

24:32.035 --> 24:34.298
Mac, look at this.

24:36.387 --> 24:38.172
Looks like he's
your biggest fan.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.180
Charlie, look at
the date on that.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.966
That's the Day
of a Thousand IEDs.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.240
SOLDIER:
Hey, guys. We got this one.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.633
CHARLIE :
Must be a mix up.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.243
I thought we were working
this section of Gardez.

25:06.287 --> 25:07.331
SOLDIER:
Ah, probably our mistake.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.811
Going on 37 hours straight.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.857
But we got this one.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.641
Pulled a real nasty one
out of the curb earlier.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.251
You guys want
another set of hands?

25:14.295 --> 25:17.603
The second EOD team.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.561
That wasn't an Army unit,
it was The Ghost's men.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.345
And they weren't defusing
the bomb, they were setting it.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.043
He was right there, Charlie.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.740
Right there.
EILEEN:
MacGyver?

25:24.784 --> 25:26.176
Charlie.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.398
The man that Jack
saw outside the U.N.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.400
two years ago,
he was dressed like a cop.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.271
So this must be
The Ghost's MO.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.012
He dresses his men up
like the local authorities.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.448
That way, they can
do whatever they want.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.102
EILEEN: We have to
warn Paris police.

25:43.933 --> 25:44.760
Did I just...?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.249
Go. Run! Now!

26:25.235 --> 26:28.325
MAN :
Hello, Mr. MacGyver.

26:29.457 --> 26:32.416
I believe you've been
looking for me.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.376
They call me The Ghost.

26:43.645 --> 26:44.994
BOZER:
Where's Mac?

26:45.038 --> 26:47.606
I tried to get to him,
but the tunnel collapsed.

26:52.132 --> 26:53.612
BOZER: Good news is:
Charlie and Eileen

26:53.655 --> 26:55.178
will both be all right.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.093
The bad news is: Charlie took
the brunt of the blast.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.095
Medic says he's sidelined.

26:59.139 --> 27:00.706
RILEY:
Matty, I got more bad news.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.317
I can't find Mac. His cell
phone's no longer transmitting.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.971
BOZER:
Some of the tunnel collapsed
when the bomb went off,

27:05.014 --> 27:06.363
so we can't get down there
to search.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.670
Find another way down
into those tunnels, Bozer.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.979
What do you got for me?

27:14.023 --> 27:16.678
Okay, Riley, we
just compiled a list

27:16.722 --> 27:18.114
of potential targets in Paris.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.463
I'm sending them to you now.

27:19.507 --> 27:20.900
Owen Douglas.

27:20.943 --> 27:22.771
He's giving a speech

27:22.815 --> 27:24.425
at the French
National Assembly building.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.601
The guy who's about to become
Prime Minister of England?

27:26.645 --> 27:29.648
Sounds like the perfect target
for a former IRA terrorist.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.520
And check this out:
it wouldn't be the first time

27:32.563 --> 27:34.609
that Douglas was targeted
for an assassination.

27:34.653 --> 27:37.220
20 years ago, Douglas was
a young British defense minister

27:37.264 --> 27:38.700
when a bomb

27:38.744 --> 27:41.224
the MI5 believes
was built by The Ghost

27:41.268 --> 27:43.966
and intended to take out
Douglas at Parliament

27:44.010 --> 27:47.491
detonated in an apartment
building just four miles away.

27:47.535 --> 27:51.191
The blast killed a young couple
and orphaned a little girl.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.323
Eileen.Eileen.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.499
The Ghost must be
settling a score.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.850
Finishing a job he didn't
complete 20 years ago.

27:57.893 --> 28:00.983
Get British Protection Command
on the phone right now.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.819
Three bombs just
went off in the city.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.039
None of them were detonated at
the National Assembly building.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.736
I thought that
was The Ghost's target.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.086
No. The Ghost wouldn't try
to kill Douglas

28:17.130 --> 28:18.522
at the National Assembly
building.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.437
Security's too tight.

28:20.481 --> 28:21.438
Then what's he doing?

28:21.482 --> 28:22.701
Forcing a response.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.138
In the event of an attack,
The Ghost knows

28:25.181 --> 28:27.531
that Douglas's protection detail
would immediately move him

28:27.575 --> 28:29.316
to a safe location in the city.

28:29.359 --> 28:30.752
So these bombs weren't
detonated to kill Douglas,

28:30.796 --> 28:32.798
but to move him to
a specific location.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.843
We need to know where
the British safe house is,

28:34.887 --> 28:37.106
because I think that's where
we're gonna find The Ghost.

28:37.150 --> 28:38.107
I'll make a call.

28:38.151 --> 28:39.761
And what about Mac?

28:39.805 --> 28:43.547
MacGyver would want us
to go after The Ghost.

28:43.591 --> 28:47.377
We have to trust that Mac
can handle himself.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.792
THE GHOST:
Mr. MacGyver.

29:10.836 --> 29:14.665
So you don't get any ideas.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.323
I really must thank you.

29:20.367 --> 29:22.586
Thank me for what?

29:22.630 --> 29:23.892
For making me better.

29:23.936 --> 29:26.808
I've faced off against
hundreds of EOD techs

29:26.852 --> 29:28.157
from all over the world.

29:28.201 --> 29:29.811
But none better
than you.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
You forced me
to improve,

29:31.857 --> 29:33.684
to push myself.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.817
And this is one of me best yet.

29:35.861 --> 29:38.777
I'm sure that brain
of yours is whirring away

29:38.820 --> 29:41.040
trying to figure out
a way to disarm it.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.825
I'll save you
the suspense.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.566
You can't.

29:45.609 --> 29:47.307
Ethylene oxide, propylene oxide,

29:47.350 --> 29:51.137
aluminum shavings.
This a fuel air bomb.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.704
Enough to level
five city blocks.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.707
What There's thousands
of people up there.

29:56.751 --> 29:58.753
I think you and I both know

29:58.797 --> 30:00.973
playing to my empathy
won't work.

30:01.016 --> 30:03.714
I don't care
about the people.

30:03.758 --> 30:06.413
No.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.110
It's all about
the money for you.

30:08.154 --> 30:10.634
Saw your video
in Afghanistan.

30:10.678 --> 30:13.681
It was you acting
like that EOD tech.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.075
All right. Good luck, boys.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.686
THE GHOST:
Looking back on it now,

30:18.729 --> 30:20.862
I should've just killed you
right there.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.908
But I was trying
to set a record, you see.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.127
1,000 IEDs.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.825
Instead,

30:26.868 --> 30:28.261
you set a record.

30:28.304 --> 30:31.046
You diffused how many?
More than 100?

30:31.090 --> 30:33.005
126.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.571
An accomplishment.

30:34.615 --> 30:39.402
I decided that day,
when I saw how good you were,

30:39.446 --> 30:42.710
that I needed to take you out
as soon as possible.

30:42.753 --> 30:46.627
So I made me move
two weeks later.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.978
I found out which section
of the city you were covering,

30:50.022 --> 30:51.675
and I hid a device.

30:51.719 --> 30:55.157
It had a pressure plate trigger,

30:55.201 --> 30:57.116
easily spotted,

30:57.159 --> 30:58.639
easily disarmed.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.728
Only, disarming
that device

31:00.771 --> 31:03.122
triggered the secondary one
in the ceiling.

31:03.165 --> 31:06.038
Everything was perfect,

31:06.081 --> 31:09.215
but then the one thing that
I couldn't control happened.

31:09.258 --> 31:11.347
Your bomb robot broke.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.132
ALFRED:
What's the holdup, Mac?

31:13.175 --> 31:15.351
Damn thing's broke again, Al.

31:15.395 --> 31:19.921
All right, finish fixing it.
I can get this one.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.793
And instead of you
entering that hut,

31:22.837 --> 31:25.405
it was your mentor.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.710
No.

31:26.754 --> 31:27.624
Pena.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.934
He took the blast
meant for you.

31:32.978 --> 31:36.068
How is his daughter Annabelle,
by the way?

31:36.111 --> 31:37.721
You ever get a chance
to visit?

31:37.765 --> 31:41.421
Touchme, and boom.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.644
So this is what?
Another payday?

31:47.688 --> 31:49.820
Oh, no.

31:49.864 --> 31:53.259
This one I'm doing for free.

32:01.658 --> 32:03.530
RILEY:
Okay, Matty, we're here,

32:03.573 --> 32:04.792
I got multiple tunnels

32:04.835 --> 32:05.967
crisscrossing under
the safe house.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.273
Well, if we're right,

32:07.316 --> 32:09.275
The Ghost hid his bomb
in one of those tunnels.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.754
Then we better be right.

32:13.235 --> 32:14.671
Okay, the tunnel's about
to split in two directions,

32:14.715 --> 32:15.803
north and south.

32:15.846 --> 32:17.674
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

32:19.415 --> 32:22.027
Agree.
I'll take the north.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.332
Guess that means
we got south.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.857
You killed a good man.

32:26.901 --> 32:29.817
Oh, I've killed lots
of good men.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.601
And women.

32:31.645 --> 32:32.733
And children.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.256
I've seen
the bodies.

32:34.300 --> 32:35.649
Six of them were kids.

32:35.692 --> 32:36.824
Honestly, I don't even remember

32:36.867 --> 32:39.087
which bomb you're talking about.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.829
Now it's time for me to go.

32:41.872 --> 32:44.136
This is good-bye, Mr. MacGyver.

32:44.179 --> 32:46.965
You could at least
tell me your name.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.360
Why would you care about that?

32:51.404 --> 32:54.624
Well, after I disarm this bomb,
I want to know the name

32:54.668 --> 32:56.452
of the man I'm never
gonna stop hunting.

32:58.846 --> 33:00.108
My name is Connor.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.111
And you won't be
hunting me after this.

33:03.155 --> 33:05.461
You're going to die down here.

33:05.505 --> 33:08.116
I know you.
There's no way

33:08.160 --> 33:11.554
you'll follow me and
leave this device to go off.

33:11.598 --> 33:12.686
It's a shame, really.

33:12.729 --> 33:15.602
You see, I've hidden
a bomb out there,

33:15.645 --> 33:16.907
somewhere in the world.

33:16.951 --> 33:18.997
A bomb I built just for you.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.129
I was hoping you would
find it one day,

33:21.173 --> 33:23.044
but c'est la vie.

33:25.177 --> 33:29.050
You know, there was a time
we might have gotten along.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.052
No chance.No, it's true.

33:31.096 --> 33:35.883
Years ago,
I believed in something.

33:35.926 --> 33:40.061
I had a cause, and like you,
I was fighting a war.

33:40.105 --> 33:43.847
But I built a bomb
that destroyed me own life

33:43.891 --> 33:46.807
and took away
the one thing I loved

33:46.850 --> 33:48.809
more than anything
in this world.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.593
What the hell are
you talking about?

33:50.637 --> 33:52.334
Eileen, get out.

33:52.378 --> 33:53.944
The bomb could
go off at any...Eileen?

33:53.988 --> 33:55.337
...second.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.086
MacGYVER:
So what was this, a setup?

34:05.130 --> 34:06.392
A way to get me
to step into his trap?

34:06.435 --> 34:07.741
I should have
never trusted...

34:07.784 --> 34:11.049
:
MacGyver... he's my father.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.578
You're Irish.Aye.

34:18.621 --> 34:21.407
My father built bombs
for the IRA.

34:21.450 --> 34:23.974
Against my mother's wishes.

34:24.018 --> 34:26.455
She didn't want him
getting involved.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.544
Didn't want the war
to consume her family.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.807
But he did it anyway.

34:30.851 --> 34:32.418
He said it was for "the cause".

34:32.461 --> 34:35.203
The IRA relocated my father
from Belfast to London

34:35.247 --> 34:37.205
to be closer to his targets.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.990
And he brought
his family with him.

34:40.034 --> 34:44.082
One day, my mother picked
me up early from school.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.171
I had a cold, so she
left work to come get me.

34:46.214 --> 34:50.479
When we got home...

34:50.523 --> 34:53.961
we found Father
in the kitchen.

34:54.004 --> 34:57.399
He was building a device.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.794
I sat downstairs and
listened as they argued.

35:00.837 --> 35:04.450
And then my father screamed:

35:04.493 --> 35:08.193
"Get out! Run, Eileen!"

35:09.281 --> 35:14.938
And then the device
he was working on...

35:14.982 --> 35:16.201
it went off,

35:16.244 --> 35:18.638
killing me mum.

35:18.681 --> 35:21.858
Killing the dad
I knew and loved.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.862
Leaving this monster.

35:27.516 --> 35:30.302
I mixed the chemicals wrong.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.913
It wasn't stable.

35:32.956 --> 35:35.089
The raids were coming,
and I was rushed.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.177
You should have never
even been building it,

35:36.221 --> 35:38.136
but you were obsessed.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.399
Your obsession killed Mum.

35:40.442 --> 35:44.011
Eileen, I'm so sorry.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.543
I forgive you, Dad.

35:57.851 --> 35:59.896
:
No.

35:59.940 --> 36:01.898
But I can never forgive
The Ghost.

36:03.639 --> 36:04.858
It ends here.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.472
MacGYVER:
Eileen, the trigger!

36:16.870 --> 36:18.915
Eileen, the bomb.
I need your help.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.439
I'm sorry, MacGyver.

36:20.482 --> 36:22.223
I only came for him.No, you can't...

36:22.267 --> 36:24.312
Eileen!

36:25.748 --> 36:27.968
Eileen!

36:44.419 --> 36:46.334
Mac. Mac!

36:46.378 --> 36:47.857
What are you guys doing here?
Get out.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.032
I'm not even sure
I can stop this thing.RILEY: Mac!

36:49.076 --> 36:50.425
We're not leaving you.

36:50.469 --> 36:52.210
That's right.
You stay, we stay.

36:54.603 --> 36:55.648
Eileen killed The Ghost.

36:55.691 --> 36:57.258
As it turns out,
that was her father.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.390
I didn't know what
she was gonna do

36:58.433 --> 37:00.522
until she did it.
When he fell,

37:00.566 --> 37:01.871
his dead-man switch
armed the bomb.

37:01.915 --> 37:04.134
Can you disarm it?No, the thing is too heavy.

37:04.178 --> 37:06.441
I can't lift it.
The components are underneath.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.835
He put them there...
It's too heavy,

37:08.878 --> 37:11.011
so I can't lift it.
No, I can't do it.Hey, hey.

37:11.054 --> 37:12.665
It's actually impossible.
It's impossible!Hey. Hey!

37:12.708 --> 37:15.407
You always say emotions
are more dangerous

37:15.450 --> 37:16.973
than the bomb at your feet.
You can do this.

37:17.017 --> 37:19.019
You need to focus. Okay?

37:23.893 --> 37:26.722
Actually, I have an idea.

37:26.766 --> 37:28.071
Of course you do.

37:28.115 --> 37:31.118

You got it?

37:41.389 --> 37:42.477
MacGYVER:
Almost.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.479
Yep, I got it. Okay.RILEY: All right.

37:44.523 --> 37:45.567
All right, now it's just
mechanical advantage

37:45.611 --> 37:46.829
and simple physics.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.614
You guys pull,
I'll sneak under and disarm it.

37:52.008 --> 37:53.619
You ready?
Yup.

MacGYVER:
Nice. All right.

38:01.366 --> 38:02.236
All right, Mac.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.340
Oh, oh...
You got it?

38:21.299 --> 38:23.170
I got it.

38:23.213 --> 38:26.347
Mac, we're running
out of time.

38:28.436 --> 38:30.786
We have 58 seconds,
according to the countdown.

38:30.830 --> 38:33.485
Yeah, according to the tarp,
we have less.

38:33.528 --> 38:37.227
Oh... great.

Oh, I got it, I got it.

BOZER:
All right.

38:59.206 --> 39:02.514
He's gone, Mac.
It's over.

39:02.557 --> 39:06.082
Yeah. Yeah.

All this time, The Ghost
has been out there,

39:13.351 --> 39:15.353
and now he's gone.

39:15.396 --> 39:16.658
Couldn't imagine
a better group of friends

39:16.702 --> 39:17.703
to share this moment with,
so...

39:17.746 --> 39:21.359
Cheers.
ALL:
Cheers.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.926
I keep wondering...

39:23.970 --> 39:26.755
was Eileen just looking to
avenge the death of her mother?

39:26.799 --> 39:28.540
Can't imagine what it's like

39:28.583 --> 39:30.106
knowing your dad killed
your mom.

39:30.150 --> 39:32.935
Then became the most famous
serial bomber in history.

39:32.979 --> 39:35.938
It's possible she just
couldn't live with the fact

39:35.982 --> 39:37.375
her father was a murderer.

Eileen disappeared, Mac.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.611
British authorities
staked out her house,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.396
but she never showed.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.615
It's possible she never
returned to England.

40:03.575 --> 40:07.317
Pena died in my place, Matty.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.929
I-I didn't tell anyone else.

40:09.972 --> 40:13.106
But The Ghost said that the bomb
that went off in Afghanistan,

40:13.149 --> 40:15.543
that was meant for me.
Mac,

40:15.587 --> 40:19.373
nothing that happened in Gardez
that day was your fault.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.594
And from everything that
you've told me about Pena,

40:22.637 --> 40:24.552
he would have given
his life to save yours.

40:24.596 --> 40:29.731
And I know that he'd be so proud
of the man you are today.

40:29.775 --> 40:31.733
The Ghost told me

40:31.777 --> 40:33.474
he left another bomb
out there somewhere.

40:33.518 --> 40:34.649
One he built just for me.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.477
One I'm supposed
to find someday,

40:36.521 --> 40:37.739
and I'm pretty sure
it's meant to kill me
or someone I care about.

40:37.783 --> 40:40.699
Mac, he said that
to get inside your head.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.266
But you can't be obsessed
with him anymore.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.486
You see where obsession
led Eileen.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.577
The Ghost is gone.

40:49.621 --> 40:51.753
Don't let him haunt you.
