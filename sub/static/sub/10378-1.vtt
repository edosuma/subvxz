06:30.400 --> 06:35.030
- You wanted to see me, Doctor?
- Have you seen Mrs Vogler, Sister?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.158
- No, not yet.
- Then I'll fill you in

06:38.320 --> 06:42.632
and give you the reasons
why you're to care for her.

06:42.800 --> 06:48.670
Mrs Vogler is an actress as you know
and was performing in Electra.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.913
In the middle of the play she fell silent
and looked around as if in surprise.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.038
She remained quiet for a minute.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.518
Afterwards she excused herself 
by saying she was overcome by laughter.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.196
The next day the theatre rang 
and asked if she'd forgotten her rehearsal.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.750
When the housekeeper went in
she was still in bed.

07:21.920 --> 07:26.232
She was awake but didn't answer questions 
and didn't move.

07:26.400 --> 07:31.758
She's been like this for three months
and been given every conceivable test.

07:31.920 --> 07:37.199
The result is clear. She's perfectly healthy, 
both mentally and physically.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.114
It's not even a question
of some kind of hysterical reaction.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.794
Any questions, Sister Alma?

07:43.960 --> 07:47.635
No? Then you can go in to Mrs Vogler.

07:55.360 --> 08:00.593
Good day, Mrs Vogler.
My name is Sister Alma.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.355
I've been employed
to look after you for a while.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.838
Perhaps I should tell you about myself.
I'm 25, engaged...

08:12.000 --> 08:15.788
I got my nursing certificate two years ago.

08:15.960 --> 08:21.592
My parents have a farm. 
My mother was also a nurse before she married.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.751
I'll fetch the dinner tray.

08:25.920 --> 08:29.754
It's fried liver and fruit salad.
It looks really good.

08:30.600 --> 08:34.479
Do you want to raise your head?
Is it okay like that?

08:40.760 --> 08:44.878
Sister Alma.
What's your first impression?

08:45.040 --> 08:47.838
I don't know what to say, Doctor.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.950
First her face looks soft, almost childish. 
Then you see her eyes...

08:54.120 --> 08:57.237
She's got such a severe look, I think.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.552
- I don't know, I should...
- What were you thinking?

09:01.720 --> 09:06.396
- I thought I should refuse the job.
- Did something frighten you?

09:06.560 --> 09:12.556
No, but she should have a nurse
who's older and more experienced.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.350
- Experienced in life. I may not cope.
- Cope?

09:17.520 --> 09:19.636
Mentally.

09:20.680 --> 09:24.958
If Mrs Vogler's silence and immobility
is the result of a decision...

09:25.120 --> 09:28.192
- it must be as she's seen as healthy.
- Well?

09:28.360 --> 09:33.753
It's a decision that shows great mental strength. 
Perhaps I'm not up to it.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.918
You might like to see the dusk, Mrs Vogler. 
I can draw them later.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.873
Shall I turn on the radio?
There's a play, l think.

09:49.200 --> 09:54.593
<i>Forgive me, my darling.
Oh, you must forgive me,</i>

09:54.760 --> 09:58.799
<i>I don't desire anything other
than your forgiveness.</i>

09:59.960 --> 10:04.476
What are you laughing at, Mrs Vogler?
Is it the actress that's funny?

10:04.640 --> 10:09.794
<i>What do you know about compassion?
What do you know?</i>

10:09.960 --> 10:12.679
<i>What do you know about compassion?</i>

10:17.160 --> 10:20.835
I don't understand things like that,
Mrs Vogler.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.516
I'm interested in film and theatre,
but I go so seldom.

10:25.680 --> 10:29.150
I have enormous admiration for artists.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.233
I think art has an enormous importance in life.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.428
Especially for people
who have problems of some kind.

10:38.600 --> 10:43.310
I shouldn't talk to you about things like that. 
I'm skating on thin ice.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.631
I'll see if I can find some music.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.631
Is that good?

10:51.120 --> 10:54.078
Good night, Mrs Vogler. Sleep well.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.151
Damn!

12:49.480 --> 12:54.952
It's strange.
You go around almost any old how.

12:55.120 --> 12:58.874
Do almost any old thing.

13:00.120 --> 13:05.399
I'll marry Karl-Henrik 
and we'll have a few children that I'll raise.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.155
All that is decided. It's inside of me.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.710
It's nothing to ponder over.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.952
It's a huge feeling of security.

13:17.120 --> 13:21.193
Then I have a job that I like
and am happy with.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.353
That's good too. But in another way.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.597
But it's good... good.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.752
It's good.

13:40.680 --> 13:44.275
I wonder what's really wrong with her?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.870
Elisabeth Vogler...

13:50.920 --> 13:53.229
Elisabeth.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.029
Would you like me to open the letter,
Mrs Vogler?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.031
Shall I read it?

15:42.560 --> 15:44.790
Shall I read it to you?

15:52.800 --> 15:58.033
"Dear Elisabeth: As I'm not allowed to see you, 
I'm writing."

15:58.200 --> 16:02.273
"If you don't want to read my letter,
you can ignore it."

16:03.880 --> 16:08.237
"I can't help seeking this contact with you"

16:08.400 --> 16:11.836
"as I'm tormented by a constant question:"

16:12.000 --> 16:17.996
"Have I harmed you in some way?
Have I hurt you without knowing?"

16:18.160 --> 16:22.756
"Has some terrible misunderstanding
arisen between us?"

16:27.920 --> 16:30.514
Should I really read any more?

16:38.320 --> 16:43.997
"As far as I understood, we were happy recently. 
We've never been..."

16:44.160 --> 16:47.357
"as close to one another."

16:47.480 --> 16:54.477
"Do you remember saying: 
Now I understand what marriage means?"

16:54.640 --> 16:59.998
"You have taught me..."
I can't see what's written here.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.118
"You have taught..." 
Now I see...

17:03.280 --> 17:09.594
"You've taught me that we must see each other 
as two anxious children" 

17:09.760 --> 17:13.594
"filled with good will and the best intentions."

17:13.760 --> 17:16.558
"But gov..."

17:16.720 --> 17:22.670
Now I see it. "But governed by forces 
we only partially control."

17:22.839 --> 17:26.310
"Do you remember saying all of that?"

17:26.480 --> 17:31.873
"We were walking in the woods
and you stopped and held my belt..."

17:39.600 --> 17:43.275
There was a photograph with the letter as well.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.718
It's a photograph of your son.
I don't know if...

17:47.880 --> 17:51.429
Would you like it, Mrs Vogler?

17:51.600 --> 17:54.273
He looks awfully sweet.

18:24.560 --> 18:30.192
I've been thinking, Elisabeth. 
I don't think you should remain at the hospital.

18:30.360 --> 18:34.194
I think it's harmful.
As you don't want to go home, 

18:34.360 --> 18:39.275
you and Sister Alma can move out
to my summer place by the sea. Hmm?

18:40.720 --> 18:46.238
Don't you think I understand?
The hopeless dream of being.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.789
Not seeming, but being.

18:50.640 --> 18:54.838
Conscious at every moment. Vigilant.

18:55.680 --> 19:00.708
At the same time the chasm 
between what you are to others and to yourself.

19:00.880 --> 19:06.352
The feeling of vertigo 
and the constant desire to at last be exposed.

19:07.400 --> 19:13.509
To be seen through, cut down,
perhaps even annihilated.

19:14.840 --> 19:21.154
Every tone of voice a lie, every gesture a falsehood, 
every smile a grimace.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.995
Commit suicide? Oh, no.

19:25.560 --> 19:29.439
That's ugly. You don't do that.

19:29.600 --> 19:35.277
But you can be immobile, you can fall silent. 
Then at least you don't lie.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.716
You can close yourself in,
shut yourself off.

19:38.880 --> 19:43.635
Then you don't have to play roles,
show any faces or make false gestures.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.916
You think...

19:46.960 --> 19:51.795
But you see, reality is bloody-minded.
Your hideout isn't watertight.

19:51.960 --> 19:55.396
Life seeps in everything.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.309
You're forced to react.

20:01.200 --> 20:06.832
No one asks if it's real or unreal,
if you're true or false.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.154
It's only in the theatre the question carries weight. 
Hardly even there.

20:13.200 --> 20:18.638
I understand you, Elisabeth. 
I understand you're keeping silent, you're immobile.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.476
That you've placed this lack of will
into a fantastic system.

20:23.640 --> 20:27.030
I understand and admire you.

20:27.200 --> 20:31.637
I think you should maintain this role
until it's played out.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.554
Until it's no longer interesting.
Then you can leave it.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.919
Just as you bit by bit
leave all your other roles.

20:44.600 --> 20:50.038
<i>Mrs Mogler and Sister Alma moved out
to the doctor's house in late summer.</i>

20:50.160 --> 20:54.472
<i>The sojourn near the sea
had a favourable effect on the actress.</i>

20:54.640 --> 20:59.031
<i>The apathy that had crippled her in hospital 
yields to long walks,</i>

20:59.200 --> 21:03.671
<i>fishing trips, cooking,
letter writing and other diversions.</i>

21:03.840 --> 21:09.392
<i>Sister Alma enjoys her rural seclusion
and takes utmost care of her patient.</i>

21:49.880 --> 21:53.759
Don't you know it's bad luck
to compare hands?

22:10.800 --> 22:15.635
Elisabeth? 
Can I read you something from my book?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.792
Or am I disturbing you? It says here:

22:18.960 --> 22:23.351
"All the anxiety we bear with us,
all our thwarted dreams,"

22:23.520 --> 22:27.911
"the incomprehensible cruelty,
our fear of extinction,"

22:28.080 --> 22:30.992
"the painful insight into our earthly condition,"

22:31.160 --> 22:36.996
"have slowly eroded our hope
of an other-wordly salvation."

22:37.520 --> 22:41.991
"The howl of our faith and doubt
against the darkness and silence,"

22:42.160 --> 22:45.994
"is one of the most awful proofs
of our abandonment"

22:46.160 --> 22:50.199
"and our terrified, unuttered knowledge."

22:51.280 --> 22:54.158
Do you think it's like that?

22:57.200 --> 22:59.316
I don't believe it.

23:00.320 --> 23:04.393
Making changes...
The worst thing with me is I'm so lazy.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.872
And then I get a bad conscience. 
Karl-Henrik scolds me for lacking ambition.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.999
He says I go around like a sleepwalker.
I think that's unfair.

23:13.160 --> 23:18.598
I was best in my group with the exams.
But he probably means something else.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.038
You know...

23:22.200 --> 23:26.034
Oh, sorry. 
You know what I sometimes think of?

23:26.200 --> 23:30.751
At the hospital where I did my exam,
there's a home for old nurses.

23:30.920 --> 23:36.517
Ones that have always been nurses,
lived for their work. Always in uniform.

23:36.680 --> 23:42.437
They live in their small rooms. 
Imagine devoting your whole life to something.

23:42.600 --> 23:46.479
I mean, believing in something.
Accomplishing something.

23:46.640 --> 23:51.395
Believing that one's life has a purpose.
I like things like that.

23:51.560 --> 23:55.473
Sticking to one thing doggedly, irrespective. 
I think one ought to.

23:56.600 --> 24:01.469
Mean something to other people.
Don't you think so as well?

24:05.160 --> 24:08.789
I know it sounds childish,
but I believe in it.

24:10.400 --> 24:13.472
Goodness, it's raining a lot!

24:13.960 --> 24:19.034
Oh, yes. He was married.
We had a relationship for five years.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.033
Then he got tired, of course.

24:22.200 --> 24:25.875
I was very much in love, that's for sure.
And he was the first.

24:26.040 --> 24:29.430
I remember it all like a long torment.

24:30.560 --> 24:34.997
Long periods of pain
and then short moments when...

24:35.160 --> 24:40.757
I'm thinking of it as you've taught me to smoke. 
He smoked loads.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.675
Thinking of it afterwards, it's really banal. 
A real pulp fiction.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.318
In a strange way
it was never really real.

24:51.480 --> 24:57.157
I don't know how to describe it.
At least, I was never quite real to him.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.518
My pain was real, that's for sure.

25:02.680 --> 25:07.754
Somehow it was is if it was part of it
in some nasty way.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.151
As if that's how it was supposed to be.

25:11.320 --> 25:15.154
Even the things we said to each other...

25:20.520 --> 25:25.594
Many people have told me 
that I'm a good listener. Funny, huh?

25:25.760 --> 25:31.153
No one's ever bothered to listen to me.
Like you are now. You're listening.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.949
I think you're the first person
who's listened to me.

25:35.120 --> 25:39.511
It can't be interesting at all.
You could read a good book instead.

25:39.680 --> 25:42.956
God, I'm going on.
You're not getting irritated?

25:43.120 --> 25:46.430
It's so nice to talk.
It feels so nice and warm.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.149
I feel like I've never felt in my whole life.

25:52.080 --> 25:56.392
I always wanted a sister.
I only have a load of brothers. Seven.

25:56.560 --> 26:01.714
Funny, huh? Then I come along. 
I've been surrounded by boys all my life.

26:02.960 --> 26:09.593
I like boys. But you would know that
with all your experience as an actress.

26:10.760 --> 26:16.517
I really like Karl-Henrik.
But, you know, you only love once.

26:16.680 --> 26:21.993
I'm faithful to him. In my profession 
there are opportunities, I can tell you.

26:26.120 --> 26:29.271
Karl-Henrik and I had hired
a cottage by the sea.

26:29.400 --> 26:33.837
It was June, we were all alone.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.710
One day when Karl-Henrik had gone into town, 
I went to the beach alone.

26:38.880 --> 26:42.919
It was really nice and warm.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.629
There was another girl there.
She lived on an island nearby,

26:46.760 --> 26:52.039
but had come over as our beach lay to the south 
and was more relaxed.

26:53.320 --> 26:57.472
So we lay beside one another
completely naked and sunbathed.

26:57.600 --> 27:02.469
We slept a little, woke up,
and put on some oil.

27:02.600 --> 27:07.469
We wore these hats on our heads,
you know, those cheap straw hats.

27:07.600 --> 27:10.956
I had a blue ribbon around my hat.

27:12.680 --> 27:15.990
I lay looking out from under the hat,

27:16.120 --> 27:20.159
glanced out at the landscape,
the sea and the sun.

27:20.280 --> 27:22.396
It was so curious.

27:27.760 --> 27:32.675
Suddenly I saw two figures jumping about 
on the rocks above us.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.190
They hid and peeped out occasionally.

27:37.320 --> 27:43.111
"There are two boys looking at us",
I said to her. Her name was Katarina.

27:43.240 --> 27:47.074
"Well, let them look", she said,
and turned on her back.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.358
It was such a strange feeling.

27:51.480 --> 27:56.031
I wanted to run and put on my costume, 
but I just lay still...

27:56.160 --> 28:02.349
On my belly with my bum in the air,
totally unembarrassed, totally calm.

28:04.840 --> 28:11.029
All the time I had Katarina beside me
with her breasts and thick thighs.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.233
She just lay there
giggling a little to herself.

28:17.400 --> 28:22.633
Then I saw the boys had come nearer.
They just stood looking at us.

28:23.480 --> 28:27.268
I saw that they were terribly young.

28:27.400 --> 28:32.076
Then one of them, the bravest one,

28:32.200 --> 28:36.273
he came up to us
and squatted down beside Katarina.

28:36.400 --> 28:42.316
He pretended to be busy with his foot
and sat poking between his toes.

28:42.440 --> 28:46.035
I felt totally strange.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.672
Suddenly I heard Katarina say:

28:50.800 --> 28:54.952
"Aren't you going to come over here?"

28:55.080 --> 28:59.278
Then she took his hand and helped him 
take his jeans and shirt off.

28:59.400 --> 29:05.430
Suddenly he was over her 
and she helped him in and held his behind.

29:07.240 --> 29:11.313
The other boy just sat on the slope
and watched.

29:11.440 --> 29:16.150
I heard Katarina whisper in his ear and laugh.

29:16.280 --> 29:19.750
I had his face right next to me.

29:19.880 --> 29:23.429
It was all red and swollen.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.518
Suddenly I turned over and said,
"Aren't you going to come to me too?"

29:30.720 --> 29:36.158
Katarina said, "Go to her now".
And he pulled out of her and...

29:36.280 --> 29:40.831
he fell over me, completely hard.
He took hold of one breast.

29:40.960 --> 29:44.919
God, it hurt so much...

29:45.040 --> 29:49.955
I was all ready somehow, I came at once. 
Can you understand that?

29:50.080 --> 29:54.517
I was just going to tell him, 
"Be careful so that I don't get pregnant",

29:54.640 --> 29:57.552
when he came. I felt...

29:57.680 --> 30:03.073
I felt it like I'd never felt it before
how he sprayed his seed into me.

30:04.040 --> 30:09.398
He gripped my shoulders and bent backwards. 
I came over and over.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.111
Katarina lay on her side looking
and she held him from behind.

30:19.760 --> 30:25.118
When he came she embraced him
and made herself come with his hand.

30:26.160 --> 30:30.039
And when she came she screamed really loud.

30:35.720 --> 30:38.917
Then all three of us started laughing.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.397
We called the other boy sitting on the slope. 
His name was Peter.

30:48.360 --> 30:52.717
He came down all confused,
looking frozen in the sunshine.

30:55.280 --> 30:59.990
Katarina unbuttoned his trousers
and started playing with him.

31:00.120 --> 31:03.351
When he came she took him in her mouth.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.637
He bent down and started kissing her on the back.

31:07.760 --> 31:11.992
She turned around, took his head in both hands 
and gave him her breast.

31:12.120 --> 31:16.079
The other boy got so excited,
so he and I started again.

31:17.600 --> 31:20.353
It was as nice as the first time.

31:22.200 --> 31:27.672
Then we swam and parted. 
When I came back, Karl-Henrik had returned.

31:30.960 --> 31:35.715
We ate dinner together 
and drank the red wine he had with him.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.912
Then we slept together.

31:40.040 --> 31:45.068
It's never been as good, before or since.
Can you understand that?

31:45.640 --> 31:49.713
Then I fell pregnant, of course.

31:49.840 --> 31:54.550
Karl-Henrik, who's studying medicine,
took me to a friend who aborted it.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.152
We were both happy.
We didn't want any children.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.556
Not just then, anyway.

32:08.680 --> 32:14.596
It doesn't make sense.
None of it fits together.

32:14.760 --> 32:20.039
Then you get a bad conscience over small things. 
Can you understand?

32:20.160 --> 32:25.792
What happens to everything you believe in? 
Isn't it necessary?

32:27.560 --> 32:32.634
Can you be one and the same person
at the same time?

32:32.760 --> 32:36.878
I mean, was I two people...?
God, I'm being silly...

32:37.000 --> 32:41.152
I don't have any reason
to start snivelling, anyway.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.431
Wait, I'm going to fetch a tissue.

33:04.240 --> 33:09.314
It's nearly morning...
and it's still raining.

33:15.680 --> 33:20.800
Imagine, I've been talking in a stream.
I've talked and you've listened to me.

33:20.920 --> 33:25.948
How boring for you. 
Of what interest can my life be to you?

33:26.080 --> 33:28.435
One should be like you.

33:29.720 --> 33:34.191
You know what I thought
when I saw your film that night?

33:34.320 --> 33:40.031
When I came home I saw myself in the mirror 
and thought: we're alike.

33:40.160 --> 33:44.233
Don't misunderstand me, you're much prettier, 
but we are alike in a way.

33:44.360 --> 33:48.990
I think I could turn myself into you.
If I made a real effort.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.076
I mean inside.

33:52.640 --> 33:56.997
You could turn yourself into me
just like that.

33:57.120 --> 34:02.194
Although your soul would be much too big. 
It would stick out everywhere!

34:05.280 --> 34:10.034
<i>You should go to bed now. 
Otherwise you'll fall asleep at the table.</i>

34:22.880 --> 34:27.635
No, I must go to bed.
Otherwise I'll fall asleep at the table.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.070
That would be a little too uncomfortable.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.437
Good night.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.231
Listen, Elisabeth...

37:32.520 --> 37:35.637
Did you speak to me last night?

38:04.960 --> 38:07.952
Were you in my room last night?

38:48.400 --> 38:51.153
Shall I take your mail as well?

38:51.960 --> 38:53.837
Can I have a taste?

38:55.560 --> 38:57.516
Bye.

40:01.120 --> 40:05.875
<i>My dear, I'd always like to live like this. 
This silence, living cut off,</i>

40:06.000 --> 40:10.835
<i>this feeling of the battered soul
finally beginning to straighten out.</i>

40:15.840 --> 40:19.037
<i>Alma's spoiling me in the most moving manner.</i>

40:21.080 --> 40:26.359
<i>I think, by the way, that she's enjoying herself 
and is quite taken with me,</i>

40:26.480 --> 40:32.396
<i>even smitten in an unconscious and delightful way. 
It's fun studying her.</i>

40:41.320 --> 40:44.153
<i>Sometimes she cries over past sins,</i>

40:44.320 --> 40:48.279
<i>an episodic orgy with a totally strange boy 
followed by an abortion.</i>

40:48.440 --> 40:52.797
<i>She complains that her notions of life
don't accord with her actions.</i>

46:22.920 --> 46:28.995
I see you're reading a play? 
That's a healthy sign, I'll tell the doctor.

46:32.040 --> 46:36.716
Don't you think we should leave soon?
I'm starting to miss town.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.877
Aren't you?

46:53.600 --> 46:56.558
Would you like to make me really happy?

46:57.200 --> 47:01.512
I know it's a sacrifice,
but I need your help right now.

47:01.640 --> 47:05.918
It's nothing dangerous.
But I want you to talk to me.

47:06.040 --> 47:11.512
Doesn't have to be special.
Anything, what we're having for dinner,

47:11.640 --> 47:16.714
or if you think the water's cold after the storm. 
If it's too cold to swim.

47:16.840 --> 47:19.798
We only need to talk a few minutes.
One minute.

47:19.920 --> 47:24.232
You can read from your book.
Just say a few words.

47:25.280 --> 47:30.718
I must try not to get angry. 
You remain silent and that's your business.

47:30.840 --> 47:34.310
But now I need you to talk to me.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.989
My dear woman,
can't you say just a single word?

47:42.160 --> 47:47.632
I knew you'd refuse.
You can't know how l feel.

47:48.920 --> 47:54.597
I always thought great artists 
felt great compassion for other people.

47:54.720 --> 47:59.589
That they created from a sense of great sympathy 
and a need to help.

47:59.720 --> 48:02.473
That was stupid of me.

48:05.160 --> 48:10.473
You've used me. Now that you don't need me 
you just throw me away.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.108
Yes, I hear very well how it sounds,
how false it sounds!

48:15.240 --> 48:19.028
You've used me, now you're discarding me. 
Every word!

48:19.160 --> 48:21.355
And then these glasses!

48:29.240 --> 48:34.155
You've really hurt me. 
You've laughed at me behind my back.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.594
I read the letter you sent to the doctor.

48:38.760 --> 48:43.550
Just think, it wasn't sealed!
And I read it thoroughly!

48:44.600 --> 48:49.116
You got me to talk. You got me 
to tell you things I've never told anyone.

48:49.240 --> 48:53.358
And you hand it on.
What a study, huh?! You're not...

48:54.200 --> 48:59.274
You're going to talk now! 
If you've got anything to say, you're bloody well...

49:12.120 --> 49:14.918
No, stop it!

49:24.920 --> 49:27.593
You were really scared now, huh?

49:29.240 --> 49:33.392
For a second you were genuinely scared, not so?

49:33.520 --> 49:38.913
A genuine fear of death, huh?
Alma's gone crazy, you thought.

49:39.040 --> 49:42.280
What kind of person are you, really?

49:42.280 --> 49:45.875
Or do you think like this:
I'll remember that face.

49:46.040 --> 49:51.512
That tone of voice, that expression. 
I'll give you something you won't forget!

50:11.960 --> 50:15.430
You're laughing, are you?

50:15.560 --> 50:20.998
It's not so simple for me.
Not so funny, either.

50:21.120 --> 50:24.192
But you've always got your laugh.

51:45.240 --> 51:48.630
Must it be like this?

51:50.000 --> 51:53.879
Is it really important not to lie,
to speak the truth,

51:54.000 --> 51:57.231
to talk with a genuine tone of voice?

51:57.360 --> 52:00.591
Can one live at all without talking freely?

52:00.720 --> 52:05.748
Lie and deviate and evade things.

52:05.880 --> 52:11.113
Isn't it better to allow yourself
to be lazy and sloppy, untruthful?

52:12.840 --> 52:17.914
Maybe you become a little better 
if you just let yourself be what you are.

52:20.560 --> 52:24.792
No, you don't understand. 
You don't understand what I'm saying.

52:24.920 --> 52:27.275
You are inaccessible.

52:27.400 --> 52:31.313
They said you were mentally healthy,
but your madness is the worst.

52:31.440 --> 52:35.638
You're acting healthy. 
You do it so well everyone believes you.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.719
Everyone except me,
because I know how rotten you are.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.797
What am I doing?

52:48.120 --> 52:52.193
Elisabeth! Elisabeth, forgive me.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.710
I behaved like an idiot,
don't know what got into me.

52:55.840 --> 53:00.595
I'm here to help you.
Then there was that awful letter.

53:00.720 --> 53:05.430
I was so disappointed.
You asked me to talk about myself.

53:06.280 --> 53:10.159
It was nice, you looked so understanding,
I'd drunk a lot...

53:10.280 --> 53:13.670
It was so nice to talk about it all.

53:13.800 --> 53:19.272
I was also flattered that a great actress
cared to listen to me.

53:19.400 --> 53:24.315
Somehow I thought it would be nice
if it was of some use to you.

53:24.480 --> 53:28.268
But it's terrible, isn't it?
Sheer exhibitionism.

53:28.400 --> 53:31.233
Elisabeth, I want you to forgive me.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.432
I like you so much,
you mean so much to me.

53:34.560 --> 53:38.314
I've learned so much from you,
I don't want to part as enemies.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.279
You don't want to forgive me.
You're too proud!

54:04.400 --> 54:07.949
You won't lower yourself
because you don't need to!

54:08.080 --> 54:11.629
I won't, I won't...!

58:06.920 --> 58:11.118
<i>We don't talk, don't listen, understand.</i>

58:14.840 --> 58:19.914
<i>- Elisabeth?
- What means should, to enable.</i>

59:02.440 --> 59:05.989
When you sleep your face is slack.

59:07.880 --> 59:11.634
Your mouth is swollen and ugly.

59:13.400 --> 59:17.632
You have a nasty wrinkle on your forehead.

59:23.920 --> 59:27.390
You smell of sleep and tears.

59:30.280 --> 59:34.034
I can see the pulse on your throat.

59:34.160 --> 59:38.119
You have a scar you normally cover
with make-up.

59:40.120 --> 59:42.076
<i>Elisabeth!</i>

59:42.920 --> 59:45.434
He's calling again.

59:46.480 --> 59:49.472
I'll find out what he wants from us.

59:49.640 --> 59:53.269
Out here, far away in our loneliness.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.238
Elisabeth?

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.868
Elisabeth? Sorry if I frightened you.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:26.675
- I'm not Elisabeth.
- I don't have any demands.

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:31.112
I didn't want to disturb you.
Don't you think I understand?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.074
The doctor explained a number of things to me.

01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:40.638
The most difficult thing is explaining to the little boy. 
I'm doing my best.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.189
There is something that lies deeper,
that is hard to catch sight of.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:51.677
You love someone, or more correctly,
say you love someone, it's...

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:56.749
It's understandable.
Tangible as words are, that is.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.270
Mr Vogler, I'm not your wife.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:05.030
You are also loved.
You build a little fellowship.

01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:10.757
It generates security. 
You see the possibility of enduring, not so?

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.636
How can I say everything I've thought
without losing my way, boring you?

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.639
I love you, as much as I did before.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.909
No, don't be so anxious, my darling.
We have one another.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:45.077
We have faith,
know each other's thoughts.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.909
We love one another.
It's true isn't it?

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.352
It's the effort that's most important,
not what we achieve. Isn't it?

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.510
To see each other as children.
Tormented, helpless, lonely children.

01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:06.112
- Elisabeth.
- Tell the boy that I'm coming soon.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.028
Mummy's been sick,
but she's longing for her little boy.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.188
Remember to buy a present for him.
From Mummy, don't forget.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.074
You know I feel such tenderness for you.

01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:24.438
It's difficult to bear.

01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:28.873
I don't know what to do with my tenderness.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:32.080
I live from your tenderness.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.554
Elisabeth, do you like being with me?
Is it nice?

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:45.835
- You're a wonderful lover. You know.
- My darling...

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.389
Anaesthetise me... throw me away!

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.478
No, I can't, I can't take any more!

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.593
Leave me alone!
It's shame, it's all shame!

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.555
Leave me alone!
I'm cold and rotten and indifferent!

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.355
It's all just lies and imitation,
all of it!

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:17.190
Elisabeth, what have you got there?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.118
What are you hiding under your hand? 
Let me see.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.318
It's the photo of your little boy.
The one you tore up.

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:31.556
We must talk about that.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.588
Tell me about it, Elisabeth.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.556
Then I will.

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:50.713
It was one night at a party, isn't that so? 
It got late and quite rowdy.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.069
Towards morning someone in the group said:

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:00.591
"Elisabeth, you virtually have it all 
in your armoury as a woman and artist."

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.598
"But you lack motherliness."

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.035
You laughed because you thought it sounded silly.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.551
But after a while you noticed
you thought about what he'd said.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:19.471
You became more and more worried.
You let your husband impregnate you.

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.637
You wanted to be a mother.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.355
When you realized it was definite,
you became frightened.

01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.191
Frightened of responsibility, 
of being tied down, of leaving the theatre.

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:38.555
Frightened of pain, of dying,
frightened of your body swelling up.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:44.198
But you played the role. 
The role of a happy, young, expectant mother.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.230
Everyone said, "Isn't she beautiful?
She's never been so beautiful."

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.670
Meanwhile you tried to abort the foetus
several times.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.234
But you failed.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:04.831
When you saw it was irreversible,
you started to hate the baby.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:08.509
And you wished it would be stillborn.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.957
You wished the baby would be dead.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.240
You wished for a dead baby.

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.753
It was a difficult and long delivery.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:31.716
You were in agony for days. 
Finally the baby was delivered with forceps.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.879
You looked with disgust and terror
at your squealing baby and whispered:

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.276
"Can't you die soon? Can't you die?"

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.996
But he survived.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:47.193
The boy screamed day and night.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.876
And you hated him. You were scared,
you had a bad conscience.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.199
Finally the boy was taken care of
by relatives and a nanny.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:06.791
You could get up from your sickbed
and return to the theatre.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:12.435
But the suffering wasn't over.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:17.554
The boy was gripped by a massive
and unfathomable love for his mother.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.117
You defend yourself.
You defend yourself in despair.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:28.475
You feel you can't return it.
So you try, and you try...

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.070
But there are only cruel 
and clumsy meetings between you.

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.990
You can't do it.
You're cold and indifferent.

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:42.148
He looks at you.
He loves you and he's so gentle.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.239
You want to hit him
because he doesn't leave you alone.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.353
You think he's disgusting
with his thick mouth and ugly body.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:54.951
His moist and pleading eyes.
He's disgusting and you're scared.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:03.676
What are you hiding under your hand? 
Let me see.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:11.235
It's the photo of your little boy.
The one you tore up.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.430
We must talk about it.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.189
Tell me about it, Elisabeth.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.677
Then I will.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.670
It was one night at a party,
isn't that right?

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.634
It got late and quite rowdy.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.355
Towards morning someone in the group said:

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:47.270
"Elisabeth, you virtually have it all 
in your armoury as a woman and artist."

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:49.960
"But you lack motherliness."

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:55.439
You laughed
because you thought it sounded silly.

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:59.633
But after a while you noticed
you thought about what he'd said.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:05.073
You became more and more worried.
You let your husband impregnate you.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.356
You wanted to be a mother.

01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:15.838
When you realized it was definite,
you became frightened.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.274
Frightened of responsibility, 
of being tied down, of leaving the theatre.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:27.712
Frightened of pain, of dying,
frightened of your body swelling up.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.712
But you played the role. 
The role of a happy, young, expectant mother.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:41.955
Everyone said, "Isn't she beautiful?
She's never been so beautiful."

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.759
Meanwhile you tried to abort the foetus
several times.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.916
But you failed.

01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:53.437
When you saw it was irreversible...

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.358
you started to hate the baby.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.836
And you wished it would be stillborn.

01:09:04.359 --> 01:09:07.397
You wished the baby would be dead.

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:14.232
You wished for a dead baby.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:21.236
The delivery was difficult and long.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:27.229
You were in agony for days. 
Finally the baby was delivered with forceps.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.078
You looked with disgust and terror
at your squealing baby and whispered:

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:36.158
"Can't you die soon? Can't you die?"

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.430
The boy screamed day and night.
And you hated him.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:46.158
You were scared,
you had a bad conscience.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.593
Finally the boy was taken care of
by relatives and a nanny.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.633
You could get up from your sickbed
and return to the theatre.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.518
But the suffering wasn't over.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:06.959
The boy was gripped by a massive
and unfathomable love for his mother.

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:12.677
You defend yourself in despair.
You feel you can't return it.

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.360
So you try, and you try...

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.869
But there are only cruel 
and clumsy meetings between you.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:25.518
You can't do it.
You're cold and indifferent.

01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:30.668
He looks at you.
He loves you and he's so gentle.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:34.839
You want to hit him
because he doesn't leave you alone.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.919
You think he's disgusting
with his thick mouth and ugly body.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:43.955
His moist and pleading eyes.
He's disgusting and you're scared.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.870
No!

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:59.635
I'm not like you. I don't feel like you.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.230
I'm Sister Alma,
I'm just here to help you.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.876
I'm not Elisabeth Vogler.
You are Elisabeth Vogler.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.230
I would like to have...

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:13.151
I love...

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.157
I haven't...

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:52.199
I've learnt quite a lot.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.672
We'll see how long I hold out.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.389
I'll never be like you, never.
I change all the time.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:21.229
You can do what you like,
you won't get to me anyhow.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:57.831
Saying doesn't help.
Cut a candle.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.750
A kind of otherness.
Not now, no. No, no.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.349
Warning and out of time.
Unforeseen.

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.758
When it was supposed to occur,
it didn't occur and so failure.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.509
Yourself where you are.
But I should do it.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.992
Not inwards, no...
Say collect and advise others...

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:23.669
The disconsolate, perhaps...

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:31.632
Take, yes... but what is closest...?

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:35.673
What's it called...? No, no, no...

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.633
Us, we, me, I...

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.312
Many words and such nausea...
Incomprehensible pain. The throw...

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:18.113
Try and listen to me now.
Repeat after me.

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.276
Nothing...

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:31.238
Nothing. No, nothing...

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.076
Nothing.

01:15:40.920 --> 01:15:45.994
That's it. That's good.
That's how it should be.
