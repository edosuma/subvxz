WEBVTT

00:04.230 --> 00:05.527
(crowd chatter)

00:10.270 --> 00:12.204
(chuckling)

00:12.240 --> 00:13.229
What?

00:13.280 --> 00:14.429
Nothing.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.801
You look... presidential.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.340
From your mouth to God's ear.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.213
Look at Eli Gold
in tails.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.114
What?

00:22.150 --> 00:24.744
Wow, the men are
really sensitive tonight.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.179
You look good, Eli.

00:27.220 --> 00:29.427
I swear, if you start
clocking my alcohol intake,

00:29.460 --> 00:31.621
I am going to do shots.
Okay.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.151
Now, would we all like
to know our goal

00:34.200 --> 00:35.451
for this Shamrock Dinner?

00:35.500 --> 00:36.592
To have a good time?

00:36.630 --> 00:38.063
No.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.021
At the end of the night,

00:39.070 --> 00:41.129
Cardinal James is going
to make a choice.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.604
He's going to shake
hands with one candidate

00:43.640 --> 00:45.198
and he's going
to hug the other.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.073
Historically, that hug
means a bump of 800,000

00:48.110 --> 00:49.600
Catholic votes.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.277
You need those votes
to beat Kresteva.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.413
So, I shouldn't
mention abortion?

00:52.450 --> 00:55.374
(stifling laughter)
Alicia, you
are Saint Alicia.

00:55.420 --> 00:58.139
I know you don't like that,
but you are.

00:58.190 --> 01:00.249
So, please, tonight,
just go with it.

01:00.290 --> 01:03.555
You're seen as a paragon
of faithful wives.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.649
You stood by your man,
you never strayed...

01:05.690 --> 01:07.555
WILL:
Good evening, everyone.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.189
Hey, Will.
Peter, hi.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.389
Thanks for the invite.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.589
No, thank you.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.789
I never got a
chance to thank you

01:15.840 --> 01:17.364
for promoting
Alicia to partner.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.173
Oh, well,
no thanks necessary.

01:19.210 --> 01:21.075
Everything she earned,
she earned on her own.

01:23.710 --> 01:24.745
Okay.

01:24.780 --> 01:27.214
I'm going
to go find a bar.

01:31.290 --> 01:32.450
Can_ I have a
red wme please?

01:32.490 --> 01:34.754
Alicia Florrick.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.678
Mike Kresteva.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.186
Happy Saint
Patrick's Day.

01:38.230 --> 01:39.720
I thought I'd find
you at the bar.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.591
Club soda,
lime, no ice.

01:41.630 --> 01:44.428
Oh, that's right,
you can't drink.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.767
Not can't, don't.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.562
Ah.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.295
Still holding a
grudge, are we?

01:48.340 --> 01:49.159
What grudge?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.802
You didn't do
something wrong, did you?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.138
Bob, Margot.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.238
No, I didn't.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.907
You're in a funny mood.

01:55.940 --> 01:58.500
Well, I have decided life
is too short not to be honest.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.643
Mm, let's see how that goes.

02:00.680 --> 02:03.387
What's your husband's
strategy for beating me?

02:03.420 --> 02:05.308
Using me.

02:05.350 --> 02:07.750
My status with women
to take the female vote.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.226
And what about me are
you worrIed most about?

02:11.260 --> 02:12.420
Hmm.

02:12.460 --> 02:15.156
Your psychopathic ability to lie
and pretend it's the truth.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.360
(chuckles):
Really?

02:16.400 --> 02:17.196
You do Mein Kampf proud.

02:17.230 --> 02:18.891
You know, there
must be some kind of

02:18.930 --> 02:21.194
conversational equivalent
to Godwin's law,

02:21.240 --> 02:22.867
because we've been talking
for less than a minute

02:22.910 --> 02:25.265
and you've already
compared me to Hitler.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.278
You know the problem
with bad people,

02:27.310 --> 02:29.574
is they use the arguments
of good people.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.407
The problem with good
people is they think

02:31.450 --> 02:32.519
of themselves
as good people.

02:32.550 --> 02:34.313
Okay, well,
this has been fun.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.443
Die choking on
your own blood, please.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.309
That's nice.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.352
Mrs. Florrick,
do you have a minute?

02:39.390 --> 02:41.551
Ah, is something wrong?

02:41.590 --> 02:43.251
No, we just need to talk
to you for a few minutes,

02:43.290 --> 02:44.552
if you don't mind.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.319
Is there something I can
help you with, Detective?

02:46.360 --> 02:48.396
DETECTIVE:
No, thank you, sir.

02:48.430 --> 02:50.318
Uh, ma'am.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.862
KREST_EVA:
Your Eminence.

02:53.900 --> 02:56.505
Mike, how are you?

02:56.540 --> 02:58.269
B_eaut_iful _
evening, Isn't It?

02:58.310 --> 02:59.902
It is that.

02:59.940 --> 03:01.737
CARDINAL:
What was that all about.

03:01.780 --> 03:02.974
KRESTEVA:
Oh, Mrs. Florrick?

03:03.010 --> 03:05.706
The detective just
asked her to go with him.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.377
Peter Florrick's wife.

03:07.420 --> 03:08.819
That's odd.

03:08.850 --> 03:10.488
I hope she's all right.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.887
Well, I hope it's not
about her son again.

03:15.590 --> 03:17.319
ALICIA:
What is it?

03:17.360 --> 03:18.258
We have a time
senSItIve matter

03:18.290 --> 03:19.450
and we need you to
look at some evidence.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.388
Is it my kids?
No, ma'am.

03:21.430 --> 03:23.398
Uh, one of your clients
was murdered tonight.

03:25.430 --> 03:27.432
(low, indistinct talking nearby)

03:38.750 --> 03:41.514
Oh, my God.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.484
DETECTIVE:
That's your client?

03:45.520 --> 03:47.715
Yes.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.250
Matthew Ashbaugh?

03:52.060 --> 03:53.391
And do you
recognize that man?

03:53.430 --> 03:54.556
No.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.692
Do you recognize
the vehicle?

03:56.730 --> 03:57.890
No.

03:57.930 --> 03:59.488
When did this happen?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.962
Three hours ago,
on State Street.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.661
Did Mr. Ashbaugh
have any enemies?

04:02.710 --> 04:04.507
Yes.

04:04.540 --> 04:06.599
He did, who?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.039
(sighs)
Many.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.401
Okay, the thing is,
Mrs. Florrick,

04:10.450 --> 04:11.508
our worry is
that that man

04:11.550 --> 04:13.541
is still out there.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.013
We have reason to believe he's
not done kIllIng tonight.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.381
You have reason?

04:16.420 --> 04:17.341
Evidence.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.743
(loud laughter)
At the scene.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.485
I can't go into
detail at this time.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.817
Hey, hey!

04:21.860 --> 04:23.384
Keep it down, please.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.593
Lawsuits often bre_ed
grudges, Mrs. FlorrIck.

04:26.630 --> 04:29.053
So, could you tell us what
cases you worked on with him?

04:29.100 --> 04:32.069
Well, there were 18.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.398
18 cases?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.498
Yes.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.600
And how many were ongoing?

04:38.640 --> 04:41.074
Eighteen.

04:41.110 --> 04:43.408
He was very...

04:43.450 --> 04:44.769
litigious.

04:44.810 --> 04:46.744
(snapping fingers):
Doug. Come on.

04:46.780 --> 04:50.341
Okay, I have to interview
a witness right now.

04:50.390 --> 04:51.812
Could you write down
anyone who was an enemy?

04:51.850 --> 04:56.059
Anyone you think
might want him dead.

04:56.090 --> 04:57.455
MAN:
All right, guys, very funny.

04:57.490 --> 04:59.890
Who ordered
the 49 leprechauns?

05:09.570 --> 05:12.573
ALICIA:
Why do you want to sue?

05:12.610 --> 05:13.702
His dog's barking.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.401
That must be difficult for you.

05:17.510 --> 05:18.477
(Jambox beeps)

05:18.510 --> 05:21.479
(Bach concerto begins playing)

05:22.920 --> 05:24.911
What are the damages?

05:24.950 --> 05:26.508
Loss of "consor-tium."

05:26.560 --> 05:27.686
Consortium.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.483
Loss of consortium.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.349
With who?

05:30.390 --> 05:32.551
Somebody I might
want to consort with.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.990
(laughing)

05:36.030 --> 05:37.429
You're laughing at me.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.529
Why are you laughing at me?

05:39.570 --> 05:41.435
Because you seem intent
on making enemies.

05:41.470 --> 05:42.869
You can't sue
the phone company.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.866
This is America;
you can sue anybody.

05:44.910 --> 05:46.639
We're not done with
your other two lawsuits.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.898
It's called
multitasking, Alicia.

05:48.940 --> 05:50.874
Now, look at me,
I am talking to you

05:50.910 --> 05:52.411
and I am designing
the architecture

05:52.450 --> 05:53.815
for new encryption
sobeare.

05:53.850 --> 05:55.772
Well, you are
much smarter than me.

05:55.820 --> 05:57.879
Well, maybe I should
look for another lavwer.

05:57.920 --> 05:58.841
Yes, please.

05:58.890 --> 05:59.982
Fire me.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.578
Please.

06:01.620 --> 06:03.383
No, no.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.920
Oh, no.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.689
You're not getting
away from me that easily.

06:06.730 --> 06:08.721
(music fades)

06:12.870 --> 06:14.565
Alicia, this is
Mr. Matthew Ashbaugh,

06:14.600 --> 06:15.760
the designer of
Baugh Tech,

06:15.800 --> 06:17.131
a web-based
streaming program.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.638
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.977
Why?

06:21.010 --> 06:23.899
Why... is it a
pleasure to meet you?

06:23.950 --> 06:25.099
Because you're
a wealthy new client

06:25.150 --> 06:26.845
and I want to make
a good ImpreSSIon.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.871
(Bach concerto playing)

06:31.520 --> 06:33.488
You travel with
your own soundtrack?

06:33.520 --> 06:34.782
Yes.

06:34.820 --> 06:35.855
Don't you?

06:35.890 --> 06:38.029
No.

06:38.060 --> 06:41.791
Well, I'll leave you two
to get better acquainted.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.497
ALICIA:
My problem isn't the music.

06:45.530 --> 06:49.466
My problem is
the music over and over.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.829
(Bach concerto playing)
You don't like Bach?

06:50.870 --> 06:52.201
I love Bach.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.543
over and over.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.845
Mrs. Florrick, "Bach song"?

06:59.880 --> 07:03.680
Why do the smartest
people hide their learning?

07:03.720 --> 07:06.143
To compensate for those
who show off their learning.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.882
I play the same "Bach song"

07:11.930 --> 07:14.148
because then they'll get bored
and stop listening to me.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.690
Ah.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.789
So, the CIA is listening to you?

07:17.830 --> 07:20.139
Mm, the bliss of the unparanoid.

07:20.170 --> 07:22.468
Luclq me.
(chuckles)

07:22.510 --> 07:24.000
DETECTIVE:
So, how we doing?

07:24.040 --> 07:26.031
(music stops abruptly)

07:32.150 --> 07:33.674
All of these?

07:35.050 --> 07:36.745
Did he have any altercations

07:36.790 --> 07:38.542
with any of these enemies?

07:40.060 --> 07:42.016
(Bach concerto playing)
You're lying...!

07:42.060 --> 07:44.085
(grunting)

07:44.130 --> 07:46.257
Any exchange of words?

07:46.290 --> 07:47.928
He's dying!
No, no.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.894
Little Sparky is dying!
Alicia!

07:49.930 --> 07:51.488
You're killing him!
Stop!

07:55.700 --> 07:57.509
Ted, you got a minute?

07:57.540 --> 07:59.132
Okay, Mrs. Florrick,

07:59.170 --> 08:00.569
we're just trying
to narrow focus.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.976
Did he ever say someone
was out to kill him?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.547
(Bach concerto playing)
(laughing)

08:05.580 --> 08:06.877
You laugh now,
Mrs. Florrick.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.138
I do laugh now.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.512
But one day you'll be
identifying my body in a morgue,

08:11.550 --> 08:12.915
then you'll know.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.780
What-what will I know?

08:14.820 --> 08:17.687
That everything I've said
is true.

08:17.730 --> 08:18.822
DETECTIVE:
He said that?

08:20.100 --> 08:20.998
And-and what
was he referring to?

08:21.030 --> 08:23.828
He said that Mossad
was out to kill him.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.067
One of his ongoing
cases was against

08:30.110 --> 08:31.737
Chicago PD. for
harassment, correct?

08:31.770 --> 08:32.634
Yes.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.977
Can you tell us what
he said about that?

08:39.050 --> 08:40.677
May I make a phone call?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.540
Now?

08:42.590 --> 08:44.285
Yes.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.015
Why?

08:46.050 --> 08:48.154
I need to make a phone call.

08:48.190 --> 08:50.158
WILL:
Alicia?Where are you?

08:50.190 --> 08:52.181
What?

08:54.360 --> 08:55.622
Who is that?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.661
It's Alicia.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.860
She says Ashbaugh's dead.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.889
Ashbaugh?

08:58.930 --> 08:59.931
Our Ashbaugh?

08:59.970 --> 09:01.289
He was murdered
on State Street.

09:01.340 --> 09:02.637
Ho-hold on, Alicia.

09:02.670 --> 09:05.104
Hold on.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.676
Can you hear us now?

09:06.710 --> 09:09.008
Yes. They want me to talk
about our cases

09:09.040 --> 09:10.246
to help them find the killer.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.339
Our-our cases
with Ashbaugh?

09:12.380 --> 09:13.972
Yes.

09:14.020 --> 09:15.908
Including the police
harassment case.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.882
You worried about
attorney-client prIVIlege?

09:18.920 --> 09:19.887
Yes.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.182
Are we still bound,

09:21.220 --> 09:23.950
given our client's new status?

09:23.990 --> 09:25.821
Uh, the privilege
survives death.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.327
With some exceptions.

09:27.360 --> 09:28.827
I don't think
this merits.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.693
With survivor approval?

09:31.730 --> 09:33.789
WILL:
Okay, we'll try and contact
the surviving family,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.262
see if they'll give
an allowance.

09:35.300 --> 09:38.007
DIANE:
In the meantime, be circumspect.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.803
You can talk about anything
shared outside

09:39.840 --> 09:40.977
the attorney-client
relationship, but not covered.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.978
ELI:
DIane?

09:45.650 --> 09:48.244
I, uh... sure.

09:48.280 --> 09:49.713
Call you back.

09:50.950 --> 09:52.815
(wolf whistles)

09:52.860 --> 09:54.612
Nice court attire?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.287
It impresses the judges.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.322
So, Diane,
I wanted to thank you

09:58.360 --> 10:00.999
for your debate-prep help.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.190
It was indispensable.

10:02.230 --> 10:03.390
It was fun.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.022
I'm not sure I'll_be
a great stand-In

10:05.070 --> 10:06.025
for Kresteva.

10:06.070 --> 10:07.037
That's true.
(laughing)

10:07.070 --> 10:08.389
So...?

10:08.440 --> 10:11.238
So, you're aware
that Justice Ludwig

10:11.270 --> 10:13.875
_was killed in a car
accrdent two weeks ago?

10:13.910 --> 10:16.174
Yes, we
represented his wife.
PETER: That's right.

10:16.210 --> 10:18.144
Which leaves open
a Supreme Court seat.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.011
Which tradition leaves

10:20.050 --> 10:21.039
to the governor
to fill.

10:21.080 --> 10:22.172
YOU want me to offer some names?

10:22.220 --> 10:23.983
No, I want you
to offer your name.

10:30.460 --> 10:31.984
(laughing awkwardly)

10:32.030 --> 10:34.021
I think that's
a posntive response.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.152
No, I'm just...

10:35.200 --> 10:38.021
You... you want me...

10:38.070 --> 10:39.992
Yes.
to be a Supreme Court justice?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.166
Yes.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.337
Your politics
mesh with Peter's.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.667
You know people with money

10:43.710 --> 10:45.109
and your name
means something

10:45.140 --> 10:46.676
to the people we
want to court...

10:46.710 --> 10:49.178
More importantly, I think you'd
make a damn good judge.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.116
I am bowled over.

10:53.150 --> 10:55.141
Great. So, say yes.

10:55.180 --> 10:56.112
I, um...

10:56.150 --> 10:58.118
I have a business.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.447
Yeah, you'll have
to relinquish that.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.151
That is, if I win.

11:01.190 --> 11:03.385
DIANE:
Um...

11:03.430 --> 11:05.125
how long do I have to decide?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.229
ELI:
Till this evening.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.818
Tonight?
PETER:
Well, unfortunately,

11:07.860 --> 11:08.952
I'm getting a lot of pressure

11:09.000 --> 11:11.161
from the_ Democratic Committee
to pIck somebody else,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.236
so I need my
candidate tonight.

11:13.270 --> 11:14.362
I understand.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.038
Okay.

11:16.070 --> 11:17.332
So, uh...

11:17.370 --> 11:18.701
that gives me three hours.

11:18.740 --> 11:19.877
ELI:
Two and a half.

11:19.910 --> 11:21.775
(laughs nervously)

11:21.810 --> 11:23.801
(indistinct radio chatter)

11:25.480 --> 11:27.118
So, you know
why I'm here.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.469
I can guess.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.987
They're afraid
I'll fall back

11:30.020 --> 11:31.248
on my attorney-client
privilege,

11:31.290 --> 11:33.110
and you're here,
as my friend,

11:33.160 --> 11:34.354
_ to coax me
Into dIsclosmg?

11:34.390 --> 11:36.358
Yes. And being
a lawyer myself,

11:36.390 --> 11:38.950
I can walk you through why it's
not attorney-client privilege.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.196
Because the client is deceased?

11:40.230 --> 11:41.788
Among other
things.

11:41.830 --> 11:44.128
The other things being,
you can help find the killer.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.126
Seems particularly
in the client's interest.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.990
I talked to my partners,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.167
and they would like me to
be circumspect.
Okay.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.404
So, did your client ever mention

11:51.440 --> 11:52.839
someone by the name
of Edward Lomax,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.836
or Eddie Lomax?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.438
Why?

11:56.480 --> 11:58.209
We're looking into
a lot of leads.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.808
It's just one
suchlead.

11:59.850 --> 12:01.044
Eddie Lomax?

12:01.080 --> 12:04.789
You bring up Lomax again, and
I'll kill you, you hear me?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.016
Unfortunately,

12:09.060 --> 12:11.358
I... can't deny

12:11.390 --> 12:13.494
or confirm_
any such mention,

12:13.530 --> 12:15.122
due to attorney-client
privilege.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.367
Okay. One more question.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.459
How you doing?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.968
How am I doing?
Good. You?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.865
Good. Need a ride
back to your party?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.060
Yeah. Um, I should probably
call my husband

12:26.110 --> 12:28.271
and tell him
where I am.
Good. And, um...

12:28.310 --> 12:30.198
maybe we can talk
sometime later?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.070
Sure. What about?
(phone beeps)

12:34.080 --> 12:35.911
(quietly):
Advice. Nothing, really.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.315
Peter. Hi.

12:38.350 --> 12:39.908
Uh, sorry about that.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.257
No, something with a client.

12:41.290 --> 12:42.951
I'll be back in a minute.

12:42.990 --> 12:44.958
How's it going?

12:44.990 --> 12:46.457
Oh, it-it's going good, I think.

12:46.490 --> 12:47.855
Uh-huh.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.219
He's free, he's
free. Come on.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.488
Oh. A-All right.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.122
Eli's prodding me,
I'm gonna have to go.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.865
So I'll see you
when-when you get back.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.299
Okay, bye.
God.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.399
All right, all right,
all right.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.805
Your Eminence.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.001
Mr. State's Attorney,
what an honor.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.042
Oh, no, no, no.
The honor is mine.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.002
And your lovely
wife-- where is she?

13:05.050 --> 13:07.041
Uh, I was just
on the phone with her.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.274
She was called away
for a moment,

13:08.320 --> 13:09.412
but she'll be
right back.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.442
Yes, I'm sorry for
the difficulty.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.879
The... the difficulty?

13:14.920 --> 13:18.253
My nephew had
the same issues.

13:18.290 --> 13:21.521
But I'm glad you're
facing it head-on.

13:23.570 --> 13:27.028
Drug addiction is a...
a difficult thing.

13:29.040 --> 13:32.066
(bagpipe plays)

13:32.110 --> 13:33.930
You all set?
Yeah.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.608
Are you gonna be okay
riding a motorcycle in that?

13:36.640 --> 13:38.039
You don't have
a motorcycle.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.241
No, but wouldn't it
be great if I did?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.918
Mrs. Florrick?

13:41.950 --> 13:43.918
I need to...

13:43.950 --> 13:45.941
Come with me, please.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.928
We found the car,
the killer's car.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.996
Great. So,
we're halfway home.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.260
There's a problem.
Car had a GPS.

13:57.300 --> 13:59.621
We ran the address
the killer entered into it.

13:59.670 --> 14:01.934
Okay?

14:03.070 --> 14:05.061
It was your apartment,
Mrs. Florrick.

14:19.490 --> 14:21.481
(phone ringing)

14:25.190 --> 14:27.192
(phone line ringing through)

14:33.000 --> 14:34.490
GRACE:
Hello?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.394
Grace, I... Is, uh...?

14:36.440 --> 14:38.567
Are you all right?

14:38.610 --> 14:40.237
Yeah, sorry, we were just
in the other room.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.508
So, everything there
is all right?

14:41.540 --> 14:42.302
Is Zach with you?

14:42.340 --> 14:44.069
Yeah. Why?
Are you at the party?

14:44.110 --> 14:45.247
Yes.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.440
Uh, no.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.209
Grace, I need you
to do something for me.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.569
You know the Vermas
on the fourth floor?

14:49.620 --> 14:51.588
I need the two of you
to go there right now.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.951
They're on vacation.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.480
Mom, what's wrong?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.283
Ugh. Okay.

14:56.320 --> 14:59.027
Go downstairs to Zach's car,
and drive over to Grandma's.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.322
Well, Grandma's here.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.488
She's... she's there? Jackie?

15:03.530 --> 15:05.327
(whirring)
Oh, no.
Your mom.

15:05.370 --> 15:07.099
Oh! (laughs)

15:07.140 --> 15:08.630
Is that Alicia?
She got us presents.

15:08.670 --> 15:09.637
(thudding, whirring)

15:09.670 --> 15:11.934
Okay, Grace, I need...
VERONICA: Oh, oh, boom.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.107
(laughing)

15:13.140 --> 15:14.368
Oh, that's so bad.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.377
VERONICA (laughs):
Ooh!

15:15.410 --> 15:16.377
Put your grandma on the phone.

15:16.410 --> 15:17.638
She wants to
talk to you.

15:17.680 --> 15:19.944
Yeah? (laughs)

15:19.980 --> 15:21.345
(laughing)

15:21.380 --> 15:24.383
VERONICA:
Alicia. I just dropped by.

15:24.420 --> 15:25.682
I brought them some more

15:25.720 --> 15:26.618
age-appropriate
presents this time.

15:26.650 --> 15:29.653
Mom... I need you
to do something for me.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.282
It's very serious.

15:31.330 --> 15:33.992
I want you to drive the kids
to your hotel, okay? Please?

15:34.030 --> 15:35.588
Now? You want me
to take them now?

15:35.630 --> 15:36.961
Yes.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.126
There's a situation.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.421
There may be danger
at my apartment.

15:39.470 --> 15:40.459
The police are on their way,
but with

15:40.500 --> 15:41.569
the parade on State Street...

15:41.600 --> 15:43.238
Kids, get your
stuff together.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.430
We're going over to my hotel.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.233
Thanks, Mom.
Can you put Zach on the phone?

15:46.270 --> 15:47.407
Sure.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.135
You have such an
excrtlng life.

15:49.180 --> 15:50.670
Zach?

15:50.710 --> 15:53.144
Hey, Mom. She's fine.
She's not causing any trouble.

15:53.180 --> 15:56.149
I know, but I need you
to do something for me.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.429
* Will I play
the wild rover, no, never... *

16:04.460 --> 16:06.724
But Saint Patrick's Day,
she can be a bit crazy.

16:06.760 --> 16:08.728
She's all right.
ALICIA: I know.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.569
Um, but if she asks you
to do something...

16:10.600 --> 16:12.591
* ...all me money
on wine and beer *

16:12.630 --> 16:14.996
* And it's no, nay, never...

16:15.040 --> 16:18.100
...that doesn't make sense,
you can disobey her.

16:18.140 --> 16:20.074
Okay? I want you
to disobey her.
* No, nay, never...

16:20.110 --> 16:21.634
But right now,
I want you out of the apartment.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.143
I have to go.
I'll talk to you later.

16:25.180 --> 16:26.499
That your kids?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.415
Everything all right?
Yes.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.610
You know attorney-client
privilege may be waived

16:32.650 --> 16:35.517
if the attorney's
life is in danger.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.155
I heard Ashbaugh mention...
Edward Lomax.

16:39.190 --> 16:42.648
You bring up Lomax again, and
I'll kill you, you hear me?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.292
Or someone mentioned it to him.

16:44.330 --> 16:46.525
An Officer Nozowitz.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.299
HELLINGER:
Do you think this had anything

16:48.340 --> 16:50.535
to do with your lawsuit against
the department for harassment?

16:50.570 --> 16:51.537
I don't know.

16:51.570 --> 16:53.629
_But I witnessed _
Nozomtz throwmg my client...

16:53.680 --> 16:56.774
against the wall and threatening
to kill him if he ever mentioned

16:56.810 --> 16:58.300
Eddie Lomax again.

16:58.350 --> 16:59.601
Okay, thanks.
That's really helpful.

16:59.650 --> 17:01.675
I'll be right back.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.688
(indistinct radio transmission)

17:13.730 --> 17:15.698
Still no word
from Ashbaugh's family.

17:15.730 --> 17:17.368
What was that about?

17:17.400 --> 17:20.130
What? What about?

17:20.170 --> 17:22.138
You and Eli and Peter.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.138
He, uh...

17:24.170 --> 17:26.832
He asked me to take the
empty seat of Justice Ludwig.

17:26.870 --> 17:29.771
He...? Really?

17:29.810 --> 17:31.141
Yes.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.647
Wow.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.238
Yes, but it-it
would mean

17:34.280 --> 17:36.248
stepping away from the...

17:36.280 --> 17:38.817
our partnership.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.216
VERONICA:
When did you get

17:42.260 --> 17:43.727
religious?
GRACE:
Why is that so weird?

17:43.760 --> 17:45.079
No, it's not weird.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.552
It's just unusual
for our family.

17:46.590 --> 17:47.750
Is it your father?

17:47.800 --> 17:48.721
Is what my father?

17:48.760 --> 17:50.091
The religion thing.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.062
No, it's all her.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.193
Oh, you know, Grace,
your father has issues.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.265
It's always the philanderers
who go to Jesus.

17:55.300 --> 17:57.768
Oh, no! The
car's blocked!

17:57.810 --> 17:59.766
Zach, where's
your car?
Mine's blocked in, too.

17:59.810 --> 18:01.539
VERONICA:
Oh! Ooh!

18:01.580 --> 18:03.241
Okay. Over there.

18:04.410 --> 18:05.604
That's a bar.

18:05.650 --> 18:07.242
Oh, don't worry.
They'll let you in.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.339
Come on. We'll sit
in the bar and wait

18:09.380 --> 18:10.688
until the cars
get unblocked.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.779
Come. Look, I'm not
trying to get you drunk.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.185
I'm trying to
get you warm.

18:14.220 --> 18:17.428
Come on.
Let's go.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.849
CAPTAIN:
* Oh, Peggy Gordon

18:19.890 --> 18:21.858
* Come sit you down...

18:21.900 --> 18:23.697
We're bringing Sergeant Nozowitz
in for questioning,

18:23.730 --> 18:25.266
and we'll get you some security.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.722
Thanks.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.863
I'll wait here with
you if you don't mind.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.868
Please.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.730
So, what was the advice?

18:32.770 --> 18:34.704
Before. . .

18:34.740 --> 18:36.378
you said you needed
some advice?

18:36.410 --> 18:38.401
Oh, no. Some other time.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.849
What other time?

18:39.880 --> 18:42.644
You're here, I'm here.

18:42.680 --> 18:44.284
And we're being serenaded.

18:44.320 --> 18:46.185
* And tell to me...

18:46.220 --> 18:48.211
(door closes)

18:50.860 --> 18:52.885
What do you think
of Will Gardner?

18:52.930 --> 18:55.524
What do I think?

18:55.560 --> 18:56.697
Yes.

18:56.730 --> 18:57.867
He's not seeing anybody, is he?

18:57.900 --> 19:00.698
No. I don't think so. Why?

19:00.740 --> 19:02.162
I don't know.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.168
Sometimes I think
he's pursumg me.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.734
Then other times...

19:05.770 --> 19:07.306
Is he reluctant because

19:07.340 --> 19:09.706
we're on the opposite
side of cases, is that it?

19:09.740 --> 19:12.743
I mean, we've faced each other
a few times, but not a lot.

19:12.780 --> 19:13.815
I don't know.

19:13.850 --> 19:15.169
I hate this stuff.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.312
It's so high school, you know?

19:16.350 --> 19:17.647
Are you sure
he's not seeing someone?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.282
Yes.

19:20.690 --> 19:22.453
Does he know
that you and I are friends?

19:22.490 --> 19:24.788
H... I don't know. Why?

19:27.560 --> 19:29.528
You should ask him out.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.289
Ugh. I knew
you were gonna say that.

19:31.330 --> 19:33.264
Laura, ask him out.
Seriously.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.767
(singing continues)
I think he'd be receptive.

19:34.800 --> 19:36.597
* My wild Irish rose...

19:36.640 --> 19:39.234
And if you ever need
advice from me sometime...
I'll yell.

19:39.270 --> 19:40.874
Yeah.
* The sweetest flower
that grows *

19:40.910 --> 19:42.832
Oh. Oh!
The restrooms?

19:42.880 --> 19:45.804
* You may search everywhere,
but none can compare *
Uh, those doors.

19:45.850 --> 19:47.818
* To my wild
Irish rose... *
(laughter)

19:47.850 --> 19:52.844
DETECTIVE:
Nozowitz. She said
your name-- Nozomtz.

19:52.890 --> 19:54.710
NOZOWITZ:
I barely knew the guy.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.648
You got to be kidding.

19:56.690 --> 19:57.827
She fingered me?!

19:57.860 --> 19:59.919
Uh, she said you got
into a fight with him.

19:59.960 --> 20:00.892
He's better off dead.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.898
He deserved it.

20:02.930 --> 20:04.921
(overlapping,
indistinct crowd chatter)

20:07.840 --> 20:09.796
You're not
wearing green.

20:09.840 --> 20:11.899
A pinch to
grown an inch.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.329
(phone beeps on)
(laughs)

20:15.880 --> 20:17.871
Me? I'm a massage therapist.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.707
Really?
Mm-hmm.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.741
(phone ringing)

20:23.690 --> 20:26.784
I'm sorry.

20:26.820 --> 20:27.957
Yeah.

20:27.990 --> 20:29.355
Kalinda, I need your help.

20:29.390 --> 20:30.926
Right now?

20:30.960 --> 20:32.928
If you can.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.554
Be right there.

20:43.870 --> 20:45.337
MAN (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for joining us...

20:45.370 --> 20:46.860
So you're the one
spreading the rumors.

20:46.910 --> 20:48.468
Oh, I'm the one?

20:48.510 --> 20:51.274
What rumors are we talking
about here, Eli?

20:51.310 --> 20:53.369
Zach Florrick being
arrested on the drugs charge.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.718
Uh, Ben, can I get
a bottle of water?

20:55.750 --> 20:59.584
I saw Mrs. Florrick being
talked to by two policemen,

20:59.620 --> 21:02.487
and then, I overheard
the detective mention pot

21:02.520 --> 21:04.624
and Zach Florrick,

21:04.660 --> 21:06.628
and that's what I repeated
when asked.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.594
That's a lie.
Yeah.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.667
What is it with you people
calling everyone a liar?

21:11.700 --> 21:13.759
Sometimes the truth
doesn't bend to your will.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.360
Sometimes things happen
which you wish hadn't.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.402
_It's such
a pomtless he, too.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.670
Zach wasn't arrested.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.632
The facts on the ground will
contradict you immediately,

21:22.680 --> 21:25.569
so... why?

21:25.610 --> 21:27.942
Just because Peter can
intimidate the state's attorney

21:27.980 --> 21:29.777
into not prosecuting

21:29.820 --> 21:31.788
does not mean an arrest
for pot didn't happen.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.014
You're good.
(laughing):
Oh.

21:33.050 --> 21:35.382
Yeah? You think so?

21:35.420 --> 21:36.751
Peter can't deny this lie.

21:36.790 --> 21:37.779
Why?

21:37.830 --> 21:39.422
Because his son was pulled over

21:39.460 --> 21:42.691
by Madison County PD
who found marijuana shake

21:42.730 --> 21:43.867
in his car, and then,

21:43.900 --> 21:45.060
Peter intimidated
the state's attorney

21:45.100 --> 21:46.590
into dropping the charges?

21:46.630 --> 21:50.600
You mean, that's why
it's hard for Peter to deny?

21:50.640 --> 21:52.562
Oh, we missed you.
I know. I'll call you.

21:52.610 --> 21:54.805
This will be a
battle toNthe death.
0.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.501
You know why it won't?

21:56.540 --> 21:58.974
'Cause I got the truth
on my side, and the truth

21:59.010 --> 22:00.978
always wins.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.443
(bagpipe plays "Amazing Grace")

22:03.490 --> 22:04.639
Look, Kalinda...

22:04.690 --> 22:06.544
Cary, come on,
it's important.

22:06.590 --> 22:07.887
I can't say anything.
It's confidential.

22:07.920 --> 22:09.615
All I want to know is that

22:09.660 --> 22:10.820
when you were at the state's
attorney's office,

22:10.860 --> 22:12.680
did you investigate
Sergeant Nozowitz?

22:12.730 --> 22:14.698
I leave Lockhart/Gardner,
I can't use what I know

22:14.730 --> 22:16.618
to benefit _
the state's attorney's office.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.059
When I leave the_ state's
attorney's office,

22:18.100 --> 22:19.362
I can't use it to beneﬁt

22:19.400 --> 22:20.799
Lockhart/Gardner.
Yeah.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.762
Look, our client,
Ashbaugh, was murdered.

22:22.800 --> 22:23.937
I heard.

22:23.970 --> 22:26.359
The killer's vehicle was found,

22:26.410 --> 22:28.901
and Alicia's address
was in the GPS.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.048
(sighs)

22:36.080 --> 22:40.380
We investigated Nozowitz
for corruption.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.614
Taking drug money.

22:41.660 --> 22:44.151
I.A.D. was looking into him
and they asked us to consult.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.658
Okay, and...
and do you know anything

22:46.690 --> 22:48.851
about a man by the name
of Edward Lomax?

22:48.900 --> 22:50.925
Yeah. Drug dealer.

22:50.970 --> 22:52.995
He was shot and killed
in the Fifth Ward.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.634
He has nothing
to do with Nozowitz.

22:54.670 --> 22:55.489
Well, Nozowitz

22:55.540 --> 22:57.064
seemed worried
about haVIng his name

22:57.100 --> 22:59.637
associated with this
dead drug dealer.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.001
I'd be careful, Kalinda.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.702
Thanks.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.705
MAN (over PA):
...dance music coming up

23:04.750 --> 23:05.705
a little later in the evening,

23:05.750 --> 23:08.810
and I hope to see
each and every one of you

23:08.850 --> 23:10.841
out on that dance floor.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.686
That's not good.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.017
KALINDA:
No. And that's the only time

23:13.050 --> 23:14.449
you saw Nozowitz with Ashbaugh?

23:14.490 --> 23:15.457
Yes.

23:15.490 --> 23:16.787
Did Ashbaugh ever mention

23:16.820 --> 23:18.481
anything to you
about corruption?

23:18.530 --> 23:20.179
No. I mean, the usual stuff.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.118
No, the police connection
to Mossad and the Unabomber.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.252
All right.

23:23.300 --> 23:25.029
And what about the Fifth Ward
murder, did he mention

23:25.070 --> 23:26.822
anything to you about that?

23:30.140 --> 23:32.438
Um, I got to go.

23:32.470 --> 23:33.539
I'll call you back.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.939
ALICIA:
Matthew, you act as if
I'm omnipotent.

23:39.980 --> 23:41.777
I can't get you everything.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.742
ASHBAUGH:
I'm just asking for the police
report, that's all.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.745
Get your investigator on it.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.041
She's on a lot of other things.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.751
W-What is the case again?

23:47.790 --> 23:49.485
A shooting in the Fifth Ward.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.145
(phone ringing)

24:19.890 --> 24:21.812
ASHBAUGH:
Alicia, are you there?Hello?

24:21.860 --> 24:23.157
ALICIA (clears throat):
Yes.

24:23.190 --> 24:24.521
Yes, I am.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.551
Alicia, this is life
and death here.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.194
The Fifth Street Ward shooting.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.925
Can you have someone
look into it?

24:29.960 --> 24:31.166
Yes.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.794
Um, Matthew, I'm...

24:33.840 --> 24:35.831
I'm going into a meeting.

24:35.870 --> 24:36.962
Can I get back to you?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.900
Yes. But get back to me quick.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.066
Mm-hmm. Okay.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.236
(phone beeps off)

24:41.280 --> 24:42.599
Hmm.

24:42.640 --> 24:43.971
HELLINGER:
Everything all right?

24:46.580 --> 24:47.911
Uh, what? Yeah, um...

24:47.950 --> 24:49.247
What is-- what do you mean?

24:49.280 --> 24:51.510
No, no, no, you just--
you seemed far away.

24:51.550 --> 24:53.142
We located Sergeant Nozowitz.

24:53.190 --> 24:54.851
We're questioning him now.
Good.

24:54.890 --> 24:56.881
Good.

24:57.930 --> 24:58.919
Good.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.621
'Kay.

25:04.330 --> 25:06.560
WILL:
Why's he want a police report?

25:06.600 --> 25:08.238
Probably thinks
we can use it

25:08.270 --> 25:10.033
in our suit
against the Chicago PD.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.004
You're suing
the police again?

25:12.040 --> 25:13.871
Will.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.798
You're the one
who gave hIm to me.

25:15.840 --> 25:17.705
Can you see
what you can find out?

25:17.750 --> 25:20.139
About this ward shooting?
What about Kalinda?

25:20.180 --> 25:21.841
She's busy.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.087
Please.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.985
He's driving me crazy.

25:26.020 --> 25:28.580
What do I get?

25:28.620 --> 25:29.848
What do you get?

25:29.890 --> 25:31.824
Yeah. What do I get?

25:37.970 --> 25:39.961
David Lee becomes
name partner?

25:40.000 --> 25:40.967
No.

25:41.000 --> 25:41.864
Then who?

25:41.900 --> 25:44.130
Ugh. I don't like
talking about this.

25:44.170 --> 25:45.239
Why?

25:45.270 --> 25:46.931
It feels like
I'm cheating on you.

25:46.970 --> 25:49.200
You found someone better.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.571
(laughs)

25:50.610 --> 25:52.942
Go with Gardner & Associates.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.572
You don't need another
name partner.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.973
(cell phone rings)

25:57.690 --> 25:59.009
Hello.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.779
Alicia?

26:00.820 --> 26:02.219
Yeah, still no luck.

26:04.030 --> 26:05.122
What?

26:05.160 --> 26:08.027
They found my address
in his GPS.

26:08.060 --> 26:09.891
Your...

26:09.930 --> 26:10.897
I'm coming down.

26:10.930 --> 26:12.022
No. No, Will.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.628
No. I-I'm fine.

26:13.670 --> 26:16.093
I was just wondering
if you remember Ashbaugh

26:16.140 --> 26:17.664
wanting information
about a murder.

26:17.710 --> 26:18.699
I'm coming down.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.707
I'll see you in 20 minutes.

26:19.740 --> 26:20.707
Will, it's okay.

26:20.740 --> 26:23.072
Alicia, you may be the target
of a murderer.

26:23.110 --> 26:24.338
I'm coming down.

26:24.380 --> 26:25.642
Do you want me to tell Peter?

26:25.680 --> 26:27.272
No, no, no.
He'll want to come, too,

26:27.310 --> 26:28.811
and he needs to concentrate
on tonight.

26:28.850 --> 26:29.919
Okay, I'll see you in a minute.

26:29.950 --> 26:30.985
Well, I'm gonna
go talk to him.

26:31.020 --> 26:31.987
Peter, you can't.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.658
He just lied about Zach.

26:33.690 --> 26:36.284
Yes, but the problem is,
it's a lie with a bad fact.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.686
You intimidated the Madison
County state's attorney

26:38.730 --> 26:40.186
on exactly this kind
of pot charge.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.050
There is no pot charge!

26:42.100 --> 26:43.897
You know the way
to battle a lie?

26:43.930 --> 26:44.965
With the truth.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.922
No.

26:46.970 --> 26:48.938
With a bigger lie.

26:48.970 --> 26:50.392
Peter. Eli.

26:50.440 --> 26:51.759
Mike.

26:54.380 --> 26:55.836
What?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.006
What are you doing?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.002
I have to go to
the men's room.

27:00.050 --> 27:02.075
Peter. Let it go.

27:02.120 --> 27:02.870
Let what go?

27:02.920 --> 27:06.117
I have to go to
the men's room.

27:06.990 --> 27:09.788
("Drunken Sailor"
starts to play)

27:09.820 --> 27:11.287
_ * What shall we do
With a drunken sailor... *

27:11.330 --> 27:13.958
I love Irish songs.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.093
I think I'm secretly Irish.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.121
Oh, you know,
they have that genetic test

27:18.170 --> 27:19.797
that tells you what
nationalities

27:19.830 --> 27:21.263
are in your background.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.267
I think I'm Moroccan,

27:22.300 --> 27:24.860
Italian and Irish.
(man retches)

27:26.240 --> 27:28.674
Alicia keep you
on a pretty short leash?

27:28.710 --> 27:29.734
No.

27:29.780 --> 27:32.669
Yeah, you go off on a lot
of adventures, don't you?

27:32.710 --> 27:33.813
I have a boyfriend.

27:33.850 --> 27:34.817
Oh, my God.

27:34.850 --> 27:35.874
I didn't know he was your
boyfriend. Since when?

27:35.920 --> 27:38.138
Since he asked me.
That's not what you said to Mom.

27:38.190 --> 27:38.986
You said he wasn't.
Have you kissed?

27:39.020 --> 27:40.385
Yeah.
Ah...

27:40.420 --> 27:42.388
Young men are
such great kissers.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.978
They're so anxious.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.383
It's like food to them.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.681
You didn't _tell Mom
you slept With Becca.

27:46.730 --> 27:47.754
Grace.
What?

27:47.800 --> 27:48.653
You said I didn't tell Mom.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.691
Why is it okay for
you and not for me?

27:50.730 --> 27:51.799
We're all family here.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.024
Have you slept with him?

27:53.070 --> 27:54.992
No.
There's nothing
wrong with that.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.894
I mean, your mom
was pregnant with you

27:56.940 --> 27:58.032
when she got married.

27:58.070 --> 27:59.139
What?

27:59.170 --> 28:00.728
Oh, you mean you didn't know?

28:00.780 --> 28:02.771
Yeah, she was
two months pregnant.
She was not.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.402
The date was two
months after.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.008
No, they changed the date.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.109
I remember when she called
your grandfather.

28:08.150 --> 28:11.017
"Oh, Daddy, Daddy,
what are we gonna do?"

28:11.050 --> 28:13.245
And he said, "Do you love him?"

28:13.290 --> 28:14.450
(chuckles)

28:14.490 --> 28:17.152
Your mother was very

28:17.190 --> 28:19.158
adventurous when she was
your age.

28:19.190 --> 28:22.796
She liked the bad boys.

28:25.270 --> 28:26.760
Peter.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.960
Mike.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.092
How's your son?

28:29.140 --> 28:30.368
Eli tells me you're worried

28:30.400 --> 28:32.129
about what I'm saying.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.137
Are you worried

28:33.170 --> 28:34.398
about what I'm saying?
No.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.806
No, I'm not worried.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.775
I mean, I think you'll say

28:39.810 --> 28:42.415
(toilet flushing)
whatever helps you.

28:42.450 --> 28:46.386
I think you'll say whatever
you want reality to be.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.980
But you're not provoked.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.988
(laughs)

28:51.030 --> 28:53.123
Is that what you're trying
to do, is to provoke me?

28:53.160 --> 28:54.923
Nah, it just seems that

28:54.960 --> 28:56.188
people have their limits.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.221
Either their wives,

28:58.270 --> 28:59.999
kids or moms.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.236
In your case,
maybe all three.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.191
(laughs)

29:02.240 --> 29:05.004
Am I being funny?

29:05.040 --> 29:07.008
No, I was just remembering
that Eli said

29:07.040 --> 29:10.237
the way to battle a lie
is to make a bigger lie.

29:10.280 --> 29:12.100
Oh, and you disagree.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.105
(grunts)

29:13.150 --> 29:14.242
No.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.077
You know the way
to battle a lie?

29:16.120 --> 29:17.212
No, but I have a feeling
you're gonna...

29:23.930 --> 29:25.784
Oh! Oh...

29:25.830 --> 29:26.854
Are you crazy?

29:28.030 --> 29:30.225
Actually, this is
the one moment I'm not.

29:30.260 --> 29:31.864
You can't hit me.

29:31.900 --> 29:32.924
You're right.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.790
You're right,
so I must not have.

29:34.840 --> 29:35.864
You just did.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.730
Are you sure?

29:36.770 --> 29:38.431
It makes no_ sense
for me to hit you.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.062
My nose is bleeding.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.873
I'm on the floor, my nose
is bleeding!

29:41.910 --> 29:43.946
Yeah, I can see that.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.971
But there must be
some other reason for it.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.184
No,no,no".

29:52.220 --> 29:54.017
(grunts)
I'll-I'll sue you.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.186
Good idea.

29:55.220 --> 29:56.209
I'll see you outside.

29:58.590 --> 30:01.024
Gentlemen, would you go up

30:01.060 --> 30:02.891
and see if Mr. Kresteva
is all right?

30:02.930 --> 30:05.364
I'm afraid he's had too much
to drink and he fell down.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.958
Yes, sir.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.467
That's a Cheshire smile.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.536
No, that's a
real smile.

30:12.570 --> 30:15.334
(indistinct chatter)

30:15.380 --> 30:16.938
Hey...

30:16.980 --> 30:18.106
it's James Bond.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.242
Alicia, are you all right?

30:19.280 --> 30:20.304
Yes.

30:20.350 --> 30:21.908
You didn't need
to come down here.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.247
I know. What are
they saying?

30:23.280 --> 30:24.247
The police?

30:24.290 --> 30:25.985
Nothing to me.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.317
But I think it has
something to do

30:27.350 --> 30:29.215
with the murder
in the Fifth Ward.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.557
I looked into it.

30:30.590 --> 30:32.581
The cops never
found the shooter.

30:32.630 --> 30:34.894
It was a drug theft.

30:34.930 --> 30:37.148
Eight pounds of
coke missing.

30:37.200 --> 30:39.088
(phones ringing,
indistinct chatter)

30:41.140 --> 30:43.062
(laughter)

30:56.280 --> 30:57.986
How was the party?

30:59.250 --> 31:01.582
Loads of fun.
(laughs)

31:03.620 --> 31:05.588
You look good.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.325
Ido?

31:07.360 --> 31:08.452
Thanks.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.320
You do, too.
No, you really look good.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.327
Rushing down here.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.998
(laughs)

31:17.700 --> 31:20.032
We were good together,
weren't we?

31:23.340 --> 31:24.898
Yes.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.975
(chuckles)

31:35.490 --> 31:37.219
We're keeping each other
from moving on.

31:38.260 --> 31:39.579
No. We're fine.

31:39.630 --> 31:40.619
No, we're not.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.025
It's past and I'm pretending
that it's not.
AllCla,

31:46.070 --> 31:47.389
I'm fine.

31:49.170 --> 31:51.309
We have a residual
something or other,

31:51.340 --> 31:52.432
and we're dealing with it.

31:52.470 --> 31:53.459
I'm being selfish.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.307
I mean, even
talking about it

31:56.340 --> 31:58.900
here, I'm being selfish.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.316
I'm back with Peter.

32:07.990 --> 32:09.958
Now this has to end.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.253
Can you just decide that?

32:18.430 --> 32:20.159
I can.

32:22.770 --> 32:23.691
I have to.

32:23.740 --> 32:25.708
(cell phone):
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.277
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

32:28.310 --> 32:30.676
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

32:30.710 --> 32:31.972
Then okay.

32:32.010 --> 32:33.170
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

32:33.210 --> 32:34.313
Hey, Mom,
pick up the phone.

32:34.350 --> 32:35.442
Sorry, I have to get this.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.016
Hey, Mom, pick up the phone.

32:37.050 --> 32:38.278
Grace, what's wrong?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.153
You were pregnant
before you got married?

32:43.290 --> 32:45.349
And I was an accident?

32:45.390 --> 32:47.358
(music comes through phone)

32:47.390 --> 32:50.097
Nothing beats Bali.

32:50.130 --> 32:52.121
The water is so clear.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.319
Like glass.

32:53.370 --> 32:55.258
And the men...

32:55.300 --> 32:58.235
so advanced, sexually.

32:59.610 --> 33:01.669
It's a Hindu culture.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.132
You didn't want a second child.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.499
We very much wanted
a second child.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.040
Where's your grandma?

33:06.080 --> 33:07.604
Is she there?
(man retches)

33:07.650 --> 33:10.414
(man coughing)
Grace, where are you?

33:10.450 --> 33:12.088
Grandma,

33:12.120 --> 33:15.248
Mom wants to
talk to you.
God.

33:15.290 --> 33:18.418
Look, we went out to the cars,

33:18.460 --> 33:21.293
but they were blocked by...
Mom, I need you
to do something for me.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.753
Look, Alicia, I didn't expect to
take care of the kids tonight.
I know.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.768
That's why I'm asking nicely.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.529
It's a little before 9:00,

33:27.570 --> 33:29.538
and I need you
to walk four blocks

33:29.570 --> 33:31.060
to the Astor Street Mansion.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.429
The Astor Street Mansion?
Yes.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.233
That's where the party's at.
I'm going there now,

33:34.280 --> 33:35.633
and I will meet you there.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.649
You're not angry?

33:38.680 --> 33:41.649
I will meet you there
in 15 minutes.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.648
Got it.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.682
(exhales)

33:48.760 --> 33:51.228
KA|__IN DA:
Detective Young!

33:51.260 --> 33:53.353
How are you
this fine evening?

33:53.390 --> 33:57.190
You're not getting a look at
the shooter's car, Kalinda.

33:57.230 --> 33:59.721
Come on, Doug.
Let me take a look.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.294
We're working here.

34:01.340 --> 34:04.207
Yeah? Checking
for connections to Nozowitz?

34:04.240 --> 34:06.299
Kalinda, you know
there's no connection.

34:07.340 --> 34:09.274
You're protecting
your detective.

34:09.310 --> 34:12.199
No. You defense attorneys
think he's wearing a badge,

34:12.250 --> 34:15.117
he must be guilty. But
Nozowitz was working undercover

34:15.150 --> 34:17.118
for the DEA.
at the time.

34:17.150 --> 34:18.219
He's innocent, Kalinda.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.128
KALIN DA:
Hey.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.650
What year Lincoln is it, Doug?

34:28.700 --> 34:32.192
2006. Zephyr.
Now leave us alone.

34:34.640 --> 34:37.598
You know the odd thing
about the 2006 Zephyr?

34:37.640 --> 34:39.608
I have no idea.

34:39.640 --> 34:41.699
It doesn't have GPS.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.248
CAPTAIN: * Paddy, dear...
HELLINGER:
I am so sorry.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.248
I had no idea.
So who knew?

34:52.290 --> 34:54.588
Whose_ idea was it to lie
about AliCia being a target?

34:54.620 --> 34:56.508
YOUNG:
Whoa, whoa. Where you going?
Back.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.482
Look, we needed
to catch a killer.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.327
Of course I'd do whatever
I could to get information

35:00.360 --> 35:02.157
from you.
Yep. Everyone's doing their job.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.191
And all I can tell you is go...

35:04.230 --> 35:06.221
CAPTAIN (loudly):
* A bloody law...
...yourself.

35:10.800 --> 35:11.664
I'm so sorry, Mike.
I-I heard.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.531
How are you doing?
Not great. Look at this.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.400
Look at this.
Do you believe this?
Oh, you'll be fine.

35:16.440 --> 35:21.218
It-it... it happens
to the best of us.

35:21.250 --> 35:24.413
It... What happens
to the best of us?

35:24.450 --> 35:27.180
A little tipple.
A little spill.

35:27.220 --> 35:29.518
It's Saint Patrick's Day.
(chuckles)

35:29.560 --> 35:30.879
It's forgivable.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.451
Your Eminence,
Peter Florrick hit me.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.456
(laughing):
Oh.
What? No.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.321
He wants you to think that I was
drinking and fell down,

35:39.370 --> 35:40.769
but it was his drink!
He put it there!

35:40.800 --> 35:42.267
He wanted it to
look like mine.

35:42.300 --> 35:43.528
CARDINAL:
No, I know, I know.

35:43.570 --> 35:45.606
You take care now, Mike.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.279
Mrs. Florrick.
AllCla.

35:48.310 --> 35:52.576
Hello. You're the one person
I haven't spent a second with.

35:52.610 --> 35:55.477
Your Eminence.
Ah, the formal greeting.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.489
Well, I had to look
it up online.
(chuckles)

35:58.520 --> 36:03.480
So, either your son has been
arrested for smoking marijuana

36:03.520 --> 36:06.489
or the police needed
your help with a murder.

36:06.530 --> 36:09.328
The latter. Uh, I don't know
who told you about the former

36:09.360 --> 36:12.420
but definitely the later.
Yes, that's what
your mother said.

36:12.470 --> 36:15.439
My... my mother?
Yes, Veronica.

36:15.470 --> 36:18.439
She was here, somewhere.
Just to be clear,

36:18.470 --> 36:21.906
your Eminence, she likes saying
things for their shock value.

36:21.940 --> 36:23.908
(chuckling):
Oh, I know.

36:23.940 --> 36:27.341
It was so nice _
to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.348
What was that?
What did he say?

36:29.380 --> 36:31.416
Nothing. Everything's good.

36:32.450 --> 36:34.884
Peter hit Kresteva.

36:34.920 --> 36:36.888
What?
Peter hit Kresteva,

36:36.920 --> 36:39.320
but everybody thinks he
fell down, so play along.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.521
Peter fell down?
No, no, Kresteva fell down.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.324
From drinking. He
has a bloody nose.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.497
Are you serious?

36:46.530 --> 36:48.566
Did you see it?
The punch? No.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.568
But I heard it was epic.
(chuckles)

36:50.600 --> 36:53.660
CAPTAIN (softly):
* In Dublin's fair city

36:53.710 --> 36:57.407
* The girls are so pretty

36:57.440 --> 37:02.514
* 'Twas there I first met
my sweet Molly Malone *

37:02.550 --> 37:06.316
* She drove her wheelbarrow

37:06.350 --> 37:08.454
* Through streets
broad and narrow *

37:08.490 --> 37:09.514
Make yourself
comfortable.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.618
Yeah.
Yeah.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.457
Look.

37:13.490 --> 37:16.027
Nozowitz is a tough cop
but an honest one,

37:16.060 --> 37:17.527
and this crap about him

37:17.560 --> 37:19.528
being tied to
the killing...
Shut up.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.435
You coni/inced me.

37:21.470 --> 37:23.529
What? How'd I do that?

37:23.570 --> 37:25.037
Our client sued a lot of people.

37:25.070 --> 37:27.766
He made a lot of people angry.
Okay.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.801
See there? That object?

37:29.840 --> 37:31.603
YOUNG:
Yeah. What is it?

37:31.650 --> 37:33.606
KALINDA:
You ever heard of Fetch-Far?

37:33.650 --> 37:34.969
Mm-mm.
It's something

37:35.020 --> 37:37.545
that dog owners use
to fling tennis balls

37:37.580 --> 37:38.683
so their dogs
can chase it.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.789
Okay.
Well,

37:39.820 --> 37:42.459
one of the people our client
sued was a dog lover.

37:42.490 --> 37:43.457
His dog was

37:43.490 --> 37:44.718
barking a lot.
Are you kidding?

37:44.760 --> 37:47.649
You-you think this is
about a dog barking?

37:47.690 --> 37:50.955
Have you ever met a dog lover?

37:51.000 --> 37:51.967
GRACE:
Mom.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.831
Grace.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.867
Where's Grandma?

37:58.910 --> 38:00.036
I don't know.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.277
She was talking
with some guy.

38:05.050 --> 38:09.009
I was pregnant...
when we got married.

38:09.050 --> 38:11.712
And we were embar...

38:11.750 --> 38:14.719
No. I was embarrassed,

38:14.760 --> 38:17.718
so I changed the
date of our wedding.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.318
And me?

38:20.360 --> 38:21.725
You were not an accident.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.988
We wanted you.

38:23.030 --> 38:26.022
Because... you thought
I'd keep you together?

38:26.070 --> 38:28.630
No, Grace.
But we're the reason why

38:28.670 --> 38:31.833
you're... not with
who you want to be.

38:31.870 --> 38:34.805
I don't want to be the reason
that you had to be responsible.

38:34.840 --> 38:36.979
Grace, listen to me.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.103
This isn't about
responsibility.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.677
This is about... love.

38:47.990 --> 38:50.811
I loved you before
you were born.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.749
And I loved Zach
before he was born.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.054
And I love you even more now.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.992
And Dad?

39:05.740 --> 39:08.573
I love him.

39:12.510 --> 39:14.512
CARDINAL:
Peter.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.011
Your Eminence.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.012
VERONICA:
Oh.

39:24.060 --> 39:26.426
There you are.
Hi, Mom.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.724
Zach and I were looking
all over for you.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.728
ZACH:
How'd it go?
Good. I'm going to talk

39:30.760 --> 39:32.796
to your grandmother for a
minute. I'll be right back.

39:32.830 --> 39:33.990
Uh-oh.

39:34.030 --> 39:36.134
No uh-oh. I just want to talk.

39:36.170 --> 39:37.967
See you later, kids.
Mom...

39:38.000 --> 39:39.865
No. No, no, no. It's
not what you think.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.799
We had an adventure. I mean,
they are such great kids.

39:42.840 --> 39:44.808
They're so funny.
They made me laugh.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.045
Though I do think you might
be protecting them too much.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.412
That's up to me.
No one is
saying it isn't.

39:49.450 --> 39:52.783
At least you can let me give you
just a modicum of advice.

39:52.820 --> 39:55.118
They need to be treated
the way I treated you.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.049
I know you don't want me to see
them, but I have to see them.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.422
And whatever you say, whatever
you do, I'm gonna see them.

40:00.460 --> 40:01.552
Even if I have to sneak
into their schools,

40:01.600 --> 40:02.589
I'm gonna see them.
Mom.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.989
Maybe I'm getting senile...

40:08.030 --> 40:10.760
but I like them.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.961
They remind me of your father.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.531
I know.

40:19.680 --> 40:23.047
Okay, I was going to rip
into you, Mom, but...

40:23.080 --> 40:24.616
we're talking tomorrow
because...

40:24.650 --> 40:27.983
you can't use the truth
to undercut me with my kids.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.212
You're right.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.455
I'm sorry.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.057
Good.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.920
PETER:
There you are.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.064
Oh, I had to step away.

40:40.100 --> 40:42.068
_ Peter._
Hi, Veronica.

40:42.100 --> 40:44.159
Would you like to dance?

40:44.200 --> 40:46.134
I would.

40:50.980 --> 40:53.175
You know, this is
just like our wedding.

40:53.210 --> 40:55.678
(Alicia laughs)

40:55.720 --> 40:57.870
So, no cardinal's hug?

40:57.920 --> 40:59.888
No.
I'm so sorry.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.751
Nah.Nah.

41:01.790 --> 41:03.758
Look, if life is
about getting a hug,

41:03.790 --> 41:06.759
then I'm in the wrong business.

41:06.790 --> 41:08.599
Thank you,
by the way.

41:08.630 --> 41:09.949
For what?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.968
Punching Kresteva.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.867
Oh. No, H... I couldn't
have punched Kresteva.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.868
It wouldn't make sense
for me to punch Kresteva,

41:16.900 --> 41:18.060
so I must not have.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.204
(chuckles)
He shook Kresteva's hand, too.

41:20.240 --> 41:22.276
What?
He didn't make a choice.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.278
He didn't hug either of you.

41:24.310 --> 41:26.005
First time ever. We are in...

41:26.050 --> 41:29.213
uncharted territory here.
Oh. Well, good.

41:29.250 --> 41:31.548
Good.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.809
Well, you're both taking
this very casually.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.819
Eli, I'm dancing
with my wife now.

41:38.860 --> 41:43.149
Okay, I'll go worry about
the campaign; you... dance.

41:46.230 --> 41:47.720
ALICIA:
Why not settle?

41:47.770 --> 41:49.567
Why are you making
so many enemies?

41:49.600 --> 41:51.739
This is for you.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.260
ALICIA:
What is it?

41:53.310 --> 41:57.178
Bach. I thought you'd
enjoy it at home.

41:57.210 --> 41:59.201
Thanks.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.218
Let's settle.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.070
Okay, Matthew?

42:04.120 --> 42:05.883
It's just a dog barking.

42:05.920 --> 42:08.013
You don't
need the money.
I've never needed the money.

42:08.050 --> 42:10.883
It was always
about the process.
What process?

42:10.920 --> 42:12.683
Being with you.

42:16.960 --> 42:18.689
Matthew...
That was a joke.

42:19.730 --> 42:21.664
Are you sure?
Yeah,

42:21.700 --> 42:24.168
I'm sure.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.169
Suing because I liked
being with you...

42:27.210 --> 42:29.098
wouldn't make sense.

42:31.140 --> 42:33.700
Okay.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.548
I'll be right back.

42:48.360 --> 42:50.897
Are you all right?

42:50.930 --> 42:53.228
Just a memory.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.158
Of what?

42:55.200 --> 42:57.259
Nothing.
