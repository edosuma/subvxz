WEBVTT

00:09.634 --> 00:13.513
Come on! Are ya golden brown yet,
you lazy son of a bitch?

00:13.596 --> 00:15.348
It is a beautiful turkey, Marty.

00:15.432 --> 00:17.183
Hey, Barbara, don't compliment the bird.

00:17.267 --> 00:20.854
It'll get complacent and dry
and disappoint me for years.

00:20.937 --> 00:24.524
-Ooh, speaking of… Andrew!
-Dad, you screamed?

00:24.607 --> 00:27.569
Help me load this masterpiece
into the Zappos box.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.529
Uh, it kind of feels wrong

00:29.612 --> 00:32.574
to bring an uninvited turkey
to the Birch's Thanksgiving.

00:32.657 --> 00:33.533
What, are you kidding?

00:33.616 --> 00:35.410
When they taste my juicy bird,

00:35.493 --> 00:37.579
they're gonna crown me
king of Thanksgiving.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.539
Now get in the car, Prince Fat Ass.

00:39.622 --> 00:44.878
Ooh, I like that name, Prince Fat Ass,
and I bow to your mushy tushy.

00:44.961 --> 00:47.172
-Wait, oh, wait! Not the trunk.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.424
Can't I please just hold the turkey
in the back seat?

00:49.507 --> 00:52.844
What? And get hot grease all over
the ultra suede?! You out of your mind?

00:52.927 --> 00:54.804
Maury, aren't you gonna
get in the trunk with me?

00:54.888 --> 00:58.224
Oh, I'd love to squeeze in there
next to your dad's sandals,

00:58.308 --> 01:00.018
but I've got a touch football game.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.353
John Wayne Bobbitt's
picking me up in ten minutes.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.481
-What?
-Turn on your headlamp, idiot!

01:04.564 --> 01:07.817
-And keep that turkey upright.
-Dad, no! Mommy!

01:07.901 --> 01:09.861
Take shallow breaths, Andrew!

01:43.186 --> 01:47.398
Bridgeton Middle is proud to welcome
the inspiration for our new mascot,

01:47.482 --> 01:48.983
Steven Van Zandt!

01:49.067 --> 01:52.737
All right, girls, I'm gonna let you
shake my Steven Van hands.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.824
And now, the car will take me
straight to the airport.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.492
-I can't believe

01:57.575 --> 01:59.828
Jessi and Ali got to meet Little Steven!

01:59.911 --> 02:04.666
What I wouldn't give to have
his meaty jowls buried in my gabagool.

02:04.749 --> 02:08.503
I don't want to think about Jessi,
or Ali, or your gabagool.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.422
I'm just jazzed because
my cousins are coming for Thanksgiving!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.383
Ooh, the Hotlanta crew!

02:13.466 --> 02:17.595
There's something about your cousin Lena
that makes me want to fall on my back

02:17.679 --> 02:20.098
-and open my vulva to the sky!

02:20.181 --> 02:22.350
Ah! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! They're here!

02:22.433 --> 02:24.394
-What's up, Uncle Urkel?

02:24.477 --> 02:26.146
-I would take exception,

02:26.229 --> 02:27.939
but family matters.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.150
Did I
just make that joke?

02:30.233 --> 02:31.568
Oh, God, no!

02:31.651 --> 02:32.527
Hey, guys!

02:32.610 --> 02:33.736
Hey, baby cuz!

02:33.820 --> 02:37.991
Ooh-hoo! Look at those braids,
you haven't gotten them redone.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.201
-What? You have to get them redone?

02:40.285 --> 02:41.870
But they hurt so much the first time.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.831
Missy, your braids are a struggle.
Look at your edges.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.542
She out here looking like
Frederick motherfucking Douglass.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.544
Okay, thank you for the compliment.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.087
He was a great abolitionist.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.256
I hope everyone brought their appetite.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.759
I made mashed cauliflower,
Brussels sprouts with tempeh gravy…

02:56.843 --> 02:57.886
What's tempeh?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.637
…and a tofurkey with acorn gravy.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.222
My baby laid it down!

03:01.306 --> 03:06.144
Oh, and I almost forgot.
For dessert, a carob pie!

03:11.566 --> 03:14.861
-Oh, my God. They are--
-The whitest Black people on the planet?

03:14.944 --> 03:17.363
You know what?
I think we should take "the walk."

03:17.447 --> 03:18.406
Eyebrows, eyebrows.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.241
Oh, oh, yeah. "The walk."

03:20.325 --> 03:22.660
I want to get
some of that fresh Northeast air.

03:22.744 --> 03:23.578
Double eyebrows.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.080
What kind of eyebrows
are you guys talking about?

03:26.164 --> 03:28.208
Just put your coat on, Questlove.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.544
Oh, God, here comes
the speed bump on Ogden Avenue.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.462
-Ow!

03:32.545 --> 03:35.006
-Hola. Hi.
-Fuck, who's speaking? Who said that?

03:35.089 --> 03:38.051
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.260
A talking turkey?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.846
Well, I am a turkey,
but my name is Fernando.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.431
Nice to meet you, Fernando.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.475
Welcome to the trunk
of my dad's brown car.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.353
Oh, you're so polite.
When your father was basting me,

03:48.436 --> 03:50.438
he called me a flightless bastard

03:50.521 --> 03:52.857
unworthy of the sack of lemons
plugging my asshole.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.694
Yeah, he once told me he regrets
crapping me out of his balls.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.405
Ay, Dios mío.
You need to stand up for yourself.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.116
Hey, you know what would
drive my dad really crazy?

04:02.200 --> 04:04.744
-Paying someone to wash his car?
-Well, we can't go that far.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.956
But I was thinking,
what if I refuse to eat you?

04:08.039 --> 04:09.916
I mean, obviously, I love that idea.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.961
Yes. Prince Fat Ass is going to topple

04:13.044 --> 04:14.712
-the mighty king-- Oh, Jesus!

04:14.796 --> 04:15.755
-Oh! Oh!

04:15.838 --> 04:16.798
That's right, Luda.

04:16.881 --> 04:20.510
This Thanksgiving,
we're going house-to-house burgling food,

04:20.593 --> 04:25.890
and nobody's gonna give a fuck because
Santa's allowed to break and enter.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.976
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.602
Brrawr. Brear. Brear.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.439
Year. Why have none of my kids
called me this year?

04:34.023 --> 04:37.735
Mmm, Greg,
these Trader Joe's tacos are scrumptious.

04:37.819 --> 04:40.905
My secret is I ignore the instructions
and just freestyle.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.991
I like to jam band the tacos.

04:43.074 --> 04:47.036
Oh! "Jam band the tacos."
That sounds like a good time.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.956
-Jessi! Tacos means vaginas.

04:50.039 --> 04:52.333
That's the first thing they teach
at hormone monster school.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.836
Mom, what's wrong with you?
Why are you so happy?

04:54.919 --> 04:58.214
I didn't mean to upset you
by being in a good mood.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.009
-Teenage girls. Am I right, Caitlin?
-Totally.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.553
Greg, you have a little…
…schmutz in your hair.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.764
Oh, yeah. There was an aioli explosion
in the storage room at work.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.599
-It's all right, I got it.
-Thank you.

05:08.683 --> 05:12.186
I'm actually not feeling too well.
I'm gonna go lay down for a minute.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.187
Ooh!

05:13.271 --> 05:16.607
Cheese Girl's sick of watching
your parents' fuck vibes.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.568
-"Fuck vibes"?
-I don't know, Connie.

05:18.651 --> 05:21.237
I'm feeling, maybe, "love vibes."

05:21.321 --> 05:23.823
You don't think they're gonna,
like, get back together, do you?

05:23.906 --> 05:27.076
Yes! Mommy and Daddy are in love again!

05:27.160 --> 05:30.621
They're gonna fuck, and you're
gonna listen, and you're gonna learn.

05:30.705 --> 05:32.123
Sure. That.

05:32.206 --> 05:35.335
But also,
you guys would be a family again.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.503
Like the Juggalos. Whoop-whoop!

05:38.129 --> 05:40.006
Greg, what's happening?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.175
-Oh, I think you know.

05:42.258 --> 05:45.595
Guys, what are you doing?
Caitlin's in the other room.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.388
-Oh, good call.
-What?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.766
I'm gonna kill Caitlin.
Isn't that what you wanted?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.267
Yes, but not literally!

05:51.351 --> 05:53.269
Too late. I already pulled the pin.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.480
Let's get out of here before it blows.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.693
We're floating away in our old house.
This is incredible.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.195
How-- How is this even happening?

06:02.278 --> 06:05.740
-I stopped eating edibles.
-And I stopped eating pussy, sweetie.

06:05.823 --> 06:06.908
Oh, okay. Wow.

06:06.991 --> 06:09.994
Damn, I didn't realize
how much we wanted this.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.663
-Yeah.
-Too bad none of it's real.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.374
Ow! That fucking hurt.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.959
-Shut up! Little baby.
-Oh, Greg!

06:17.043 --> 06:18.878
They do seem really happy.

06:18.961 --> 06:22.382
Yeah, but how do we
get Shannon to stop eatin' pussy?

06:22.465 --> 06:24.342
It's so good.

06:24.425 --> 06:29.013
Oh… Oh, Jessi, my heart.
My heart, it hurts!

06:29.097 --> 06:31.432
Did he get bitten by a Dracula?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.852
No! He's the victim of unrequited love.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.771
Our hearts are shattered!

06:36.854 --> 06:40.608
Shattered? Maybe we should
get that fixed at the Genius Bar.

06:40.691 --> 06:43.861
No, we didn't get AppleCare. Remember?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.780
-Jessi!
-Jessi!

06:45.863 --> 06:47.740
AppleCare!

06:47.824 --> 06:51.828
Oh, sweetheart, we are so excited
to meet your new boyfriend.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.456
Is he the one, Leah?
Is he the one you'll love your whole life?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.500
-Tell me you have no doubts.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.043
-Ooh! I'll get it!
-No, I'll get it!

06:59.127 --> 07:02.797
-Out of my way, Nick's sister!
-Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!

07:02.880 --> 07:05.383
I'd like to apologize in advance
for everything.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.968
We brought the good turkey!

07:07.051 --> 07:09.011
Oh, how rude of me, of course.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.430
Into the garbage with you!

07:10.513 --> 07:12.765
Wait till you taste this juicy bird!

07:12.849 --> 07:14.475
You'll realize that none of you

07:14.559 --> 07:17.687
have ever accomplished anything
in your entire lives!

07:17.770 --> 07:20.398
-Hey, buddy. How's it going?

07:20.481 --> 07:21.315
I know.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.192
Jessi told you in no uncertain terms

07:23.276 --> 07:24.777
-that you're fucking dog shit.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.196
But here's something
that'll make you feel better.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.907
-I'm not eating my father's turkey today.
-Why?

07:29.991 --> 07:33.536
Because I'm standing up for myself,
and I'm going at it sideways.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.454
Okay.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.206
Hey! I'm back. You missed
a hell of a touch football game.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.583
O.J.'s still got it.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.625
O.J. Simpson?

07:39.709 --> 07:42.920
Oh, yeah, it's me, the Juice,
Buttafuoco, Gillooly,

07:43.004 --> 07:44.547
all the '90s monsters.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.425
-Steven Seagal looks like shit.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.136
Ugh. That's probably Leah's new boyfriend.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.930
"Boyfriend"?
I thought you promised Leah to me.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.599
That sounds like a wet dream you had,

07:54.682 --> 07:56.476
and I told you
I don't want to be in those!

07:56.559 --> 07:58.644
Oh, Nick, I have no control.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.272
Well, hello, gentlemen.

08:01.355 --> 08:05.568
-What the fuck?
-Leah is dating Val Bilzerian?

08:05.651 --> 08:10.072
You know, Val's dad, Guy Bilzerian,
also plays in the '90s monsters game.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.241
-Do you know who he carpools with?
-Someone awful?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.409
No. No, no, no.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.785
Robert Durst.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.122
-Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.250
Hello, hello. Hi. Is that real marijuana?

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
Oh, God. It's weed.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.463
You know we gotta be high to eat
your mama's nasty-ass tree gravy.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.798
Cool. Totally cool.
Everything's cool here.

08:27.882 --> 08:31.636
It's just marijuana, the gateway drug,
as they say on the street.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.346
-Yo, Missy, you want to hit this?
-Ah!

08:33.429 --> 08:36.516
I'm not doing drugs because
I care deeply about my brain development!

08:36.599 --> 08:38.684
-We're fucking with you.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.811
You're our baby cousin.
We're not letting you smoke.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.940
Oh. What an insane
and totally unnecessary prank.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.358
You got me. Ha!

08:45.441 --> 08:47.318
So Missy Miss, how's school and shit?

08:47.401 --> 08:50.279
Well, let's see.
Uh, I started an affinity group,

08:50.363 --> 08:53.449
and my first project was to get rid
of the school's offensive mascot.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.951
Okay. Little Takiyah Thompson.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.370
But nobody listened to my 20-point plan--

08:57.453 --> 08:58.913
Twenty points? God damn!

08:58.996 --> 09:02.041
Missy! Baby boo! Why are you such a dork?

09:02.124 --> 09:04.126
Oh, I'm not a dork. I don't think.

09:04.210 --> 09:06.712
I'm just smart and passionate
and earnest and committed.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.548
She really is her daddy's daughter.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.841
-She a little baby Steve Urkel.

09:10.925 --> 09:14.095
Oh, shit, your cool cousins
also think you're a dork.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.305
Why do you say "also"? Who else does?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.808
Well, I do, and everyone at school.

09:18.891 --> 09:21.227
That's probably why
they didn't want to hear your plan,

09:21.310 --> 09:23.354
because nobody wants to listen to a dork.

09:23.437 --> 09:26.315
People listened to Obama. Barack Obama?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.150
Obama's not a dork!

09:28.234 --> 09:30.528
He ripped lines of coke
off the Harvard Law Review.

09:30.611 --> 09:34.782
Oh, yeah? Well, did Obama ever do this?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.158
-Yes! All the time!
-Shit!

09:36.242 --> 09:38.369
-No! Why the fuck would you do that?

09:38.452 --> 09:39.954
Because I'm not a dork!

09:40.037 --> 09:43.541
I'm the first Black president
of these United States.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.794
And my wife is even cooler than me!

09:46.877 --> 09:49.171
-Quinta, we are so fucked, man.
-Oh, God!

09:49.255 --> 09:51.257
She gonna be even weirder
now that she high.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.054
Ai-ida! I must be dazed and confused

09:57.138 --> 10:00.558
because I'm pretty sure
I just saw Santa doing parkour!

10:00.641 --> 10:02.435
Ho! Ho!

10:02.518 --> 10:03.644
Ho!

10:03.728 --> 10:05.271
Ho!

10:05.354 --> 10:07.481
Merry Thanksgiving!

10:07.565 --> 10:09.483
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

10:09.567 --> 10:15.072
So, Val, when your family abandoned Jay
over spring break and I called your mom,

10:15.156 --> 10:16.907
was it you who farted into the phone?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.993
-Mom!
-It's okay, I'm a Bilzerian.

10:19.076 --> 10:22.955
I was raised by a deeply flawed patriarch,
which is why it's so lovely to be here.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.540
There's a real warmth in this home.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.336
Oh, yeah, like the warmth of the cum
on the cracker you tried to make me eat?

10:28.419 --> 10:30.421
This guy almost ruined Triscuits for me!

10:30.504 --> 10:32.256
You jizzed on our couch a week ago!

10:32.340 --> 10:35.009
Okay, that's my cue. Back to the kitchen.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.177
These guys are right.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.471
I've done things in my past
that I'm not proud of,

10:38.554 --> 10:40.056
but I'm different with Leah.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.099
She's really very special.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.977
Oh, well, yes. She is very special.

10:45.061 --> 10:47.021
Aww, you're special, too, babe.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.272
This is so unfair!

10:48.356 --> 10:51.192
A piece of shit like Val Bilzerian
gets to find love?

10:51.275 --> 10:55.696
And you, a certified snack,
is rejected by Jessi?

10:55.780 --> 10:57.281
This is a fucking joke.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.077
Thanksgiving is about
bringing people together!

11:01.160 --> 11:03.871
Oh, my God, I love your hat.

11:03.954 --> 11:06.666
I made it at school. It's made of paper.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.835
Are you very old or very young?

11:09.919 --> 11:13.798
Well, time is a flatbread pizza,
so you do you, baby.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.216
You okay, babe?

11:15.299 --> 11:17.009
You've hardly touched
your mini spanakopitas.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.261
Yeah, I'm just not super hungry right now.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.765
Ooh! Hard to have an appetite
when you're about to get dumped!

11:22.848 --> 11:24.684
-Fuckin' chump.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.770
Greg, do you remember
our first Thanksgiving as a family?

11:27.853 --> 11:28.896
Oh, yeah!

11:28.979 --> 11:30.481
Jellybean, we'd just had you,

11:30.564 --> 11:33.526
and your mother was exhausted,
so I had to be hunter and gatherer.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.860
He went to Quiznos.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.362
-Okay, Your Honor,

11:36.445 --> 11:38.739
but in my defense,
you said you wanted a hot meal.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.784
Oh, man, my uncle had a heart attack
in a Quiznos.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.744
Oh, that's a bummer, babe.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.913
Read the room, Caitlin. Damn!

11:45.996 --> 11:49.333
Seriously, dude, love is being rekindled.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.043
Rekindled like a mofo!

11:51.127 --> 11:52.294
Excuse me.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.588
Everyone, all this talk of family
makes me feel like

11:54.672 --> 11:58.050
this is the perfect time to share
a big announcement with you, Jellybean.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.343
Really, Greg? Now?

11:59.427 --> 12:03.389
Oh, my God, is he about to dump Caitlin
for my mom on Thanksgiving?

12:03.472 --> 12:08.144
Hey, Cheese Girl, have fun finding
discount dick on Black Friday!

12:08.227 --> 12:09.520
-Caitlin and I…
-Holy shit!

12:09.603 --> 12:11.564
…are baking a brie in her tummy!

12:11.647 --> 12:12.648
-Wait, what?
-What?

12:12.732 --> 12:14.817
We are having a baby!

12:14.900 --> 12:16.110
-No!
-Oh, shit.

12:16.193 --> 12:17.653
We're starting a family!

12:17.737 --> 12:20.156
You already have a family, asshole!

12:20.239 --> 12:22.575
And we don't want a damn cheese baby!

12:22.658 --> 12:24.285
I'm lactose intolerant!

12:24.368 --> 12:26.370
Um, can I please be excused?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.080
-Oh, Jessi--
-Jellybean, are you okay?

12:28.164 --> 12:29.206
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:29.290 --> 12:32.209
I just, um,
need to get out of here right now.

12:32.793 --> 12:35.921
Hey! Vidal Sassoon! What do you think
of my turkey? It's good, right?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.048
Oh, it's very good, Mr. Glouberman.

12:38.132 --> 12:42.011
Diane! What do you think of my turkey?
Doesn't it make you hate your husband?

12:42.094 --> 12:45.055
No, but it is very moist, Marty.
What's your secret?

12:45.139 --> 12:46.182
-Anger!
-Of course.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.184
You've got to insult it!

12:48.267 --> 12:50.019
That's what keeps the juices in.

12:50.102 --> 12:53.731
I learned that trick from my father,
and he learned it from his father.

12:53.814 --> 12:55.775
That's the Glouberman way.

12:55.858 --> 13:00.237
I remember every Thanksgiving,
my dad standing over that worthless bird.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.781
You stupid turkey.

13:01.864 --> 13:05.201
My family is gonna eat you and then
shit you out because you are nothing!

13:05.284 --> 13:07.703
And before him was my Zaide Shlomo.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.956
You see, in the Depression,
all he had was a street pigeon,

13:11.040 --> 13:14.251
but he would berate it
until it tasted like a turkey!

13:14.335 --> 13:17.296
You stupid pigeon,
you're a repulsive bird.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.924
You're a rat with wings,
that's all you are.

13:20.007 --> 13:23.427
And who can forget
my great Zaide Chaim in the shtetl?

13:23.511 --> 13:25.471
There was no fowl of any sort!

13:25.554 --> 13:27.681
You shmegegge cabbage!

13:27.765 --> 13:31.185
God wouldn't even grant you
the honor of being a lettuce!

13:32.394 --> 13:35.523
Ooph, you spin quite a yarn, Father.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.818
But tonight,
I won't be eating your trunk turkey.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.735
Oh, God.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.821
What do you mean,
you're not eating my turkey?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.948
It shall not pass my lips!

13:44.031 --> 13:46.367
-Oh, yes, it shall pass!
-Ah!

13:46.450 --> 13:49.370
-You're gonna eat my turkey.
-The hell I am, you old bitch!

13:49.453 --> 13:51.497
-Holy shit!
-Marty, Andrew, knock it off!

13:51.580 --> 13:53.999
I'm not eating Fernando.
He's a good listener.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.918
-Elliot, do something!
-Hey!

13:56.001 --> 14:00.172
Go, Andrew. Go, Marty!
It's Thanksgiving! I love you.

14:00.256 --> 14:01.674
-Marty!
-Ah!

14:01.757 --> 14:04.176
-Eat it, you ungrateful little bastard!
-Hold his nose.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.636
I hate you!

14:05.719 --> 14:07.680
I wish Dr. Birch was my dad!

14:07.763 --> 14:09.974
And I wish the turkey was my son!

14:10.057 --> 14:12.309
That's enough, you two! We're leaving!

14:12.393 --> 14:15.271
Elliot, Diane,
I'm sure you regret inviting us.

14:15.354 --> 14:18.315
-Only a little bit.
-Oh, yeah? Well, I'm taking my turkey.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.984
Come on! In the box. Let's go.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.112
Andrew, I made a video of you
getting force-fed by your daddy

14:23.195 --> 14:24.822
-for your future therapist.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.909
I'm gonna call it,
"Papa face-fucks son with meat."

14:28.993 --> 14:33.497
I am ready to chow down, everybody!
Just throw it into my mouth.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.957
-Missy, be cool.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.962
I actually think I'm very cool
with these big-ass fingy-tips.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.006
Oh shit, this bitch gon' get us caught!

14:42.089 --> 14:45.509
Ooh, la, la,
she's so beautiful!

14:45.593 --> 14:47.928
Well, family,
I'd like to start off

14:48.012 --> 14:50.764
by acknowledging that
we are on indigenous land.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.057
-And of course…

14:52.141 --> 14:54.560
…I'd like to thank my sweet Monica,

14:54.643 --> 14:58.814
because this heart of mine
beats for nobody but you, baby!

14:58.898 --> 14:59.732
Ooh!

15:00.858 --> 15:02.401
-Whoa! Cyrus!

15:02.484 --> 15:04.528
-Did I do that?

15:07.531 --> 15:09.116
Missy, what's gotten into you?

15:09.199 --> 15:11.410
That baby is high as hell.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.703
-High? No!
-What?

15:12.786 --> 15:15.247
I'm not high, I'm low!

15:15.331 --> 15:18.834
Oh, my God, my daughter is
under the influence of drugs!

15:18.918 --> 15:21.086
Girls, what the hell happened
on that walk?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.756
-Lena gave her weed!
-Whoa, no, no. Missy took the weed.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.635
I can't believe you hooligans were
smoking marijuana in front of her!

15:27.718 --> 15:32.640
Cyrus-Byrus Foreman-Greenwald, I know
you not calling my babies "hooligans"!

15:32.723 --> 15:33.933
-Yeah!
-Thanks, Mom!

15:34.016 --> 15:35.267
Shut it. You two are fucked!

15:35.351 --> 15:38.145
-Missy, what the hell?
-Why do you always have to act so lame?

15:38.228 --> 15:39.855
Oh… Oh…

15:39.939 --> 15:42.358
Mona, I don't like being stoned anymore!

15:42.441 --> 15:43.817
I'm freaking out too.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.111
Your grandma is staring right in my eyes.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.404
I think she can see me.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.406
You need to leave, Mona.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.033
Oh, shit!

15:52.952 --> 15:55.496
Merry Thanksgiving, you sad little fuck.

15:55.579 --> 15:59.708
Jesus, Jay. What are you doing in my garb…
Oh, are you gonna fuck the turkey?

15:59.792 --> 16:03.754
What? I'd never fuck a turkey that's been
in the trash. Please think better of me.

16:03.837 --> 16:05.464
-Okay.
-Trash turkey?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.299
Now, that's for eating!

16:07.383 --> 16:09.677
Did you know that Val and Leah are dating?

16:09.760 --> 16:10.886
What?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.805
Oh, my God! That's incredible.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.265
-This means I'm gonna be your uncle!
-No, it doesn't.

16:15.349 --> 16:19.561
Hey, don't talk to Uncle Jay like that.
You treat me with respect!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.647
Jay, get the fuck out of my house.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.065
Luda!

16:23.148 --> 16:25.067
-Let's roll.
-Rrr.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.988
Rrrin. Bin.
I took a shit in the recycling bin.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.656
My dad's such an asshole.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.450
I'm angry,
I'm embarrassed, I'm humiliated.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.869
I'm all these things, Maury.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.038
Honestly, I don't know what to say.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.666
-Oh, perhaps the audience should decide.
-What?

16:40.749 --> 16:44.336
Should I tell Andrew
to jack off or kill himself?

16:44.420 --> 16:48.465
-No, oh, don't… No, no.
-Text "Jack" or "Die" to 6969.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
What the fuck?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.093
Ooh, that was close.

16:51.176 --> 16:52.094
That's chilling.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.887
And these are fans of the show.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.850
-I hope you can still get hard now.
-How can I get hard? I'm starving!

16:57.933 --> 16:59.727
Well, there's still
some trunk turkey left.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.061
-Hmm.
-Get a little white meat

17:01.145 --> 17:02.896
so you can pound your white meat?

17:02.980 --> 17:05.858
Get some gravy so you can make your gravy.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.360
-Get some stuffing so--
-Okay, we get it. Enough.

17:08.444 --> 17:12.239
Well, why don't we go to the audience
to see if they want one more?

17:13.240 --> 17:16.118
Oh, come on,
why did you even put that as an option?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.412
I didn't. It's truly chilling.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.290
How are you okay with this?

17:21.373 --> 17:24.126
I don't know.
Caitlin and your father are a good fit.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.962
You mean they're both stupid
and don't know how condoms work?

17:27.046 --> 17:30.132
Jessi, you know
your father can't afford condoms.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.593
The point is,
Caitlin makes your dad happy.

17:32.676 --> 17:35.554
-But you and Dad were laughing together.
-We're trying to get along.

17:35.637 --> 17:40.184
I just-- It looked like maybe you guys
would, um, I don't know. Nev-never mind.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.685
Oh, sweetie, did you think--

17:41.769 --> 17:44.313
It's stupid. I know. Just forget it.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.398
Honey, I love your dad,

17:46.482 --> 17:49.568
and because of you, we are always
going to be in each other's lives,

17:49.651 --> 17:51.320
but I like women.

17:51.403 --> 17:54.323
I wanna smooch 'em, I wanna hug 'em,
I wanna sniff 'em, I wanna--

17:54.406 --> 17:57.159
-Okay, Mom.
-They're yummy. What can I say?

17:57.242 --> 17:59.995
Knock, knock?
Hey, Jellybean. How are you feeling?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.122
-Not good, Dad.
-Maybe this will cheer you up.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.333
Are you ready to meet the cheese baby?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.794
-What are you talking about?
-Isn't it adorable?

18:06.877 --> 18:11.340
My name
is Cheese Baby! Change my diaper!

18:11.423 --> 18:13.842
Oh, fuck,
its teeth are like sharp crackers!

18:13.926 --> 18:18.055
Let me grab your hair
with my fat little fist!

18:18.138 --> 18:21.350
Oh, no, the Cheese Baby
is popping all the balloons!

18:21.433 --> 18:22.851
-What?
-Okay.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.312
We need to get rid of some dead weight.
Sorry, Jessi!

18:25.395 --> 18:26.271
-Hey!

18:26.355 --> 18:28.107
-Ah!
-Condoms are for millionaires.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.151
-Jessi! This is terrible!
-I know!

18:31.235 --> 18:33.112
Good thing none of it's real!

18:33.195 --> 18:35.781
Ow! Would you please stop hitting me?

18:35.864 --> 18:38.575
Okay. Next time, I'll poke you
in the tuckus with a pitchfork.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.160
Jess, are you okay?

18:40.244 --> 18:42.496
I, um…
I think I just need to get some air.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.833
-Ooph, this place is a dump.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.503
-What's up, little guy?
-Hey, you know what? I'm onto you.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.797
Oh, oh, yeah?
What'd you find out, Detective?

18:51.880 --> 18:54.091
That I'm gonna fuck your sister
until she happy cries?

18:54.174 --> 18:55.926
"Happy cries"? Wait, what?

18:56.009 --> 18:59.972
Yeah, I'm gonna have sex
with your sister in your bed with my dick.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.932
-Ew!
-Happy Thanksgiving!

19:08.647 --> 19:12.609
Oh, shit, that bald rage volcano
makes a good turkey.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.695
-Hey.
-Oh, hello, Fernando.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.071
I'm sorry I'm eating you.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.408
It's okay. I'd offer you
some of my juicy ass, but it's all gone.

19:19.491 --> 19:24.079
Oh, yeah. My sweaty father gobbled it up
like it was the antidote to a poison.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.832
The man is a savage. A savage, I say!

19:26.915 --> 19:30.502
He's a lot, for sure, but I've been
thinking about that story he told.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.254
What, with the pigeons and the cabbage?

19:32.337 --> 19:36.133
Yes, but also about how anger has
haunted your family for generations.

19:36.216 --> 19:39.720
You know, my Zaide used to brag
that he invented road rage.

19:39.803 --> 19:42.890
And this is your father's
first Thanksgiving without Zaide.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.391
Yes? That must be very hard for him.

19:44.474 --> 19:46.852
Oh, I don't think he has real feelings.

19:46.935 --> 19:49.521
He only seems to care
about his ultra suede seats

19:49.605 --> 19:51.773
and his stupid turkey. No offense.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.900
None taken.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.777
But is it possible
that I am more than just a turkey?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.529
How do you mean? Like a goose?

19:57.613 --> 19:59.448
Oh, goose is a garbage bird. No!

19:59.531 --> 20:02.659
What I'm saying is
maybe all of those angry Gloubermans

20:02.743 --> 20:05.370
express their love
by cooking a delicious turkey.

20:05.454 --> 20:06.705
Hold on, juicy turkey.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.833
Are you saying that
you are my father's love language?

20:09.917 --> 20:11.460
-Perhaps.
-Oh, God.

20:11.543 --> 20:16.465
He was trying to shove his love
into my mouth by force, and I refused.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.635
Yes, you were too busy reacting
to his anger with your own anger.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.929
Wow, you're
a freakishly perceptive turkey.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.472
It's the hormones.

20:23.555 --> 20:27.517
But Andrew, maybe you can break
the cycle of Glouberman rage.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.228
What do you think, audience?

20:29.311 --> 20:31.605
Should he break the cycle or should--

20:31.688 --> 20:33.106
No, no! No more votes.

20:33.190 --> 20:35.192
I'm gonna make my own choices.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.610
Oy, yoy, yoy. Ugh.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.736
Chilling.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.656
Oh, Mona, now my cousins hate me!

20:40.739 --> 20:43.492
Oh, your life is total shite!

20:43.575 --> 20:47.079
Melissa, I never thought I'd have
to say this to you, but you're grounded.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.622
No more after-school activities!

20:48.705 --> 20:51.458
Who cares? Nobody wants
to hang out with me anyway.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.501
It's a moot point.

20:52.584 --> 20:55.003
Well, then, no more NPR!

20:55.087 --> 20:56.797
Their programming has become stale!

20:56.880 --> 20:59.967
Okay, you're clearly still high as a kite!

21:00.050 --> 21:01.134
You, go to your room!

21:01.218 --> 21:02.761
Fine! I'd like to do that,

21:02.844 --> 21:04.054
and I'm taking some pie.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.097
No, Missy.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.147
This is the worst Thanksgiving ever.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.941
Except for the first one!

21:16.024 --> 21:19.987
What we did to the indigenous people
of this land is shameful!

21:20.070 --> 21:22.072
"Pie" means vagina.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.993
That's the second thing they teach you
at hormone monster school.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.162
Mmm. God damn, this is some good vagina.

21:29.246 --> 21:32.708
-Tonight was really special.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.962
Usually on Thanksgiving, I have to coax
my mom off the roof with pills.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.630
Aw, I had a nice time too.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.550
Hey! You--you need to know something.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.968
Ew! Were you watching us?

21:43.051 --> 21:45.721
Yeah, whatever. It doesn't…
That's not what's important.

21:45.804 --> 21:47.889
Guess what
the Talented Mr. Rip-ass told me.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.182
-You mean Val?
-Yeah.

21:49.266 --> 21:53.687
That fucking con artist said he wants
to have sex with you until you happy cry.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.604
Whoa!

21:54.688 --> 21:57.357
That sounds like
a very positive experience.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.026
And none of your business.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.068
Good night, Nick!

22:00.152 --> 22:01.320
What the fuck?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.864
Val is a bad guy, and Leah doesn't care?

22:03.947 --> 22:07.242
And you're a good guy,
and Jessi doesn't care.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.119
Isn't love just the worst?

22:09.202 --> 22:11.038
Wait, hold on. How can you say that?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.372
You're a lovebug.

22:12.456 --> 22:14.666
Which means I know it better than anyone.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.126
I mean, don't get me wrong,

22:16.209 --> 22:21.715
being with a girl is as exhilarating
as holding a star in your hand.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.425
-Really?
-But up close,

22:23.508 --> 22:28.930
that star will explode in your face
and melt the skin off your bones.

22:29.014 --> 22:32.434
Oh, great. Well, thanks for showing up
and ruining my fucking life.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.894
Now, hold on, little fella.

22:33.977 --> 22:36.605
Oh, Jesus, the Gratitoad. Here we go.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.107
-Oh, sure, it's Thanksgiving.
-Ew. No.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.650
When I'm down in the dumpers,

22:40.734 --> 22:43.362
I like to make a list of all the things

22:43.445 --> 22:44.696
that I'm grateful for.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.614
Fuck that!

22:48.742 --> 22:49.785
Come on, everybody! Oing!

22:49.868 --> 22:51.286
-Feel any better?
-A little.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.538
I like the sound he made when you hit him.

22:53.622 --> 22:57.709
Well, this is it.
The last of my Halloween candy.

22:57.793 --> 23:01.505
The wrapper says "fun size",
but it doesn't feel fun.

23:01.588 --> 23:04.257
Oh, my gosh,
should I do stand-up? Go, Lola!

23:04.341 --> 23:08.261
Oh, man, I can't wait to get home
and eat all this inside the bathtub.

23:08.345 --> 23:09.679
-What's that?

23:09.763 --> 23:12.307
Lola? Oh, fuck.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.103
-Huh! A clatter outside.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.562
Whomst ever could it be?

23:18.647 --> 23:21.483
Gasp! A cornucopia!

23:21.566 --> 23:26.279
Father Thanksgiving
has truly smiled upon me this year.

23:27.614 --> 23:28.573
Come on, Luda,

23:28.657 --> 23:32.285
let's go home and see if there's any
burnt cheese at the bottom of the toaster.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.454
Rrrrrst. Rrressed. Stressed.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.999
Stressed.
I'm already stressed about Christmas.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.211
Hey! What do you want?

23:41.294 --> 23:43.964
I had some of your turkey,
and it was really good.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.049
Yeah? Well, you shoulda had it
when it was hot.

23:46.133 --> 23:48.468
You're right, Dad.
I should've had it when it was hot.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.470
Wait--wait a minute! Wait a minute!

23:50.554 --> 23:51.888
What, are you agreeing with me?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.266
You trying to get back
on my health insurance?

23:54.349 --> 23:56.309
No, no. I know, they're all crooks.

23:56.393 --> 23:57.894
I just wanted to talk.

23:57.978 --> 24:00.897
Dad, was it hard
not going to Florida this year?

24:00.981 --> 24:03.608
I don't know.
You know, it was, um… It was different.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.777
Yeah, I-I-I thought so too.

24:05.861 --> 24:09.281
So do you, you know… Do you miss Zaide?

24:09.364 --> 24:12.492
Of course I miss him. He's my father.
What kind of a question is that?

24:12.576 --> 24:14.494
But, Dad, he was so mean.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.413
He wasn't mean, he was tough.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.081
You know, he was tough like I'm tough,

24:18.165 --> 24:21.501
and maybe he didn't always know
how to say it, but I knew he loved me.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.336
I love you too, Dad.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.339
Uh, um,
I'm glad you liked the turkey, son.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.467
And, uh, in retrospect,

24:28.550 --> 24:31.428
I'm sorry for how I voted in those polls.

24:34.931 --> 24:38.101
Oh, hey, you're here.
What's going on?

24:38.185 --> 24:41.938
Look, I, um, I know
you're still mad at me about Samira,

24:42.022 --> 24:45.650
but my life's a fucked-up mess
and I just really need someone to talk to.

24:45.734 --> 24:48.737
Oh, shit. Uh, okay.
What's wrong?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.448
My parents
are never getting back together.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.492
Oh, honey Jew-Jew.

24:53.575 --> 24:57.537
And my dad and Cheese Girl are having
a demon cheese baby with cracker teeth.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.830
Putting a pin in that.

24:58.914 --> 25:02.626
And I think my family
is really officially over.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.170
I'm sorry, Jessi, that sucks!

25:05.253 --> 25:09.382
Look, I'm sorry…
I'm sorry I broke up you and Samira.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.009
Oh, uh, that's okay.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.970
It's not your fault,
even though it kind of is.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.764
Uh, but I still love you.

25:16.389 --> 25:17.933
I love you too.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.894
Ugh! Isn't she the fucking best?

25:20.977 --> 25:22.771
Yeah, she really is.

25:22.854 --> 25:25.315
I'm glad you came over. I've missed you.

25:25.398 --> 25:26.525
I missed you too.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.777
-Um…

25:29.361 --> 25:31.571
Jessi, this is totally hot!

25:31.655 --> 25:32.489
I know!

25:32.572 --> 25:34.574
I did not see that coming.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.910
Too bad it's not real. Pitchfork!

25:36.993 --> 25:37.827
Ow!

25:37.911 --> 25:40.247
-What the fuck?
-I told ya the slap was better.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.706
Hey, are you okay?

25:41.790 --> 25:46.002
I'm sorry. I actually, um…
I need to get back home, okay?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.129
Um, thank you for talking to me. Bye.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.423
Wait, Jessi!
Don't you wanna French her for real?

25:50.507 --> 25:53.093
Oh! Oh, hey Gratitoad!

25:53.176 --> 25:55.887
Oh, hey, Connie! Happy Thanksgiving.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.640
I, for one, am grateful
for your ample bosom.

25:58.723 --> 26:03.019
-Permission to motorboat you, please?
-It's Thanksgiving, baby. Gobble away!

26:04.312 --> 26:08.900
-Thanks for the mammaries!
-Happy Thanksgiving indeed!
