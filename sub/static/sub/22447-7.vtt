00:04.170 --> 00:05.210
Previously on Andi Mack...

00:05.210 --> 00:08.460
If we didn't race,
we could still do this.

00:08.460 --> 00:09.790
Which we're
both good at.

00:09.790 --> 00:12.500
-Maybe one of us is slightly better.
-(laughs) No.

00:12.500 --> 00:16.500
-Can't help yourself, can you? -You're
the only person who gets that.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.710
Should Jonah and I
be holding hands by now?

00:18.710 --> 00:22.250
Good-sized knuckles. I don't see any
reason not to be holding this hand.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.210
You're so creative.
You're so smart.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.000
-Sorry, sometimes my palms get sweaty.
-(laughs)

00:32.000 --> 00:33.790
Pops and CeCe
are selling the house.

00:33.790 --> 00:36.580
What about AndiShack?
What happens to AndiShack?

00:36.580 --> 00:39.040
Don't worry. We'll find room
for your craft supplies.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.500
AndiShack is not just the place
that I keep my glue gun.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.670
There's nothing else like it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.750
Cyrus, hey. What brings
you to The Fringe?

01:02.750 --> 01:06.210
Oh, we just got in a shipment
of mustache magnets.

01:06.210 --> 01:07.880
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you...

01:08.880 --> 01:11.420
but... you have company.

01:11.420 --> 01:14.170
Oh, yeah, Brittany asked me
to put faces on these.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.670
This one's Winona.

01:16.670 --> 01:19.540
This one's Marilyn,
note the beauty mark.

01:19.540 --> 01:21.500
And then Tigress.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.750
She's the fiestiest.

01:24.250 --> 01:29.040
Mm-hmm. You know, if you ever
need someone human to talk to,

01:29.040 --> 01:32.620
my parents are professionals, and I'm
sure one of them takes your insurance.

01:32.620 --> 01:34.620
Dude, I haven't lost it.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.580
Tell him, Marilyn.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.540
(chuckles)
So, what's up?

01:38.540 --> 01:41.420
I have decided
to become a screenwriter,

01:41.420 --> 01:46.040
And I've written a script, and I need
someone to read it, and I've chosen you.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.790
Oh. Well, this is
a surprise...

01:48.790 --> 01:51.580
and an honor.
Mostly a surprise.

01:51.580 --> 01:53.750
There's just five years left
before I apply to college,

01:53.750 --> 01:55.750
and so far my only
extracurricular activities

01:55.750 --> 01:57.500
are substitute
flag monitor

01:57.500 --> 01:59.750
and lunch lady's
favorite assistant.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.040
I guess it's never too early
to start obsessing.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.210
-But why a screenplay?
-Well, I'm blocked on my novel

02:06.210 --> 02:09.500
and my rock opera doesn't seem
ground-breaking enough.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.620
Please read it.
I need an objective opinion.

02:11.620 --> 02:13.380
(scoffs)
Well, why me?

02:13.380 --> 02:16.540
Why not Andi
or Buffy or... anyone?

02:16.540 --> 02:18.500
They'll just tell me
what I want to hear.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.920
Plus I know you're doing that
movie makeup unit in school

02:20.920 --> 02:25.000
and I was really hoping I could get
some feedback from someone in the biz.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.670
Okay, but I'm not sure
I'm qualified.

02:29.670 --> 02:32.330
I really don't think I'd know a
good script from a terrible script.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.620
This is a terrible script.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.210
I was climbing
a mountain.

03:34.210 --> 03:35.250
It felt
so real,

03:35.250 --> 03:36.420
like I was
actually

03:36.420 --> 03:37.710
touching
the rocks.

03:37.710 --> 03:38.500
One day we'll be telling

03:38.500 --> 03:39.540
our kids that we actually had

03:39.540 --> 03:41.040
to go outside to touch rocks.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.620
They don't just have
rock climbing.

03:42.620 --> 03:45.290
They have hang gliding,
volcano jumping,

03:45.290 --> 03:46.670
or you can just sit
in a tree house

03:46.670 --> 03:48.710
-with a hedgehog.
-(laughs)

03:48.710 --> 03:50.670
This place must be new.
I didn't know there was

03:50.670 --> 03:52.460
a virtual reality
arcade in town.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.500
I could use some
virtual reality.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.330
My actual reality
kind of stinks.

03:58.710 --> 04:00.710
CeCe is selling their house.

04:00.710 --> 04:03.210
She is? That's terrible.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.830
Yeah. It is.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.620
Including AndiShack,

04:07.620 --> 04:12.250
which is the most important
place in the world to me.

04:12.250 --> 04:16.750
So, can we please change the
subject before I start crying?

04:16.750 --> 04:19.330
Hey, if you want to take
your mind off of things,

04:19.330 --> 04:20.960
I'll take you to the
arcade this weekend.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.830
Yeah, that sounds good.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.580
Cool. It's a date.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.460
(both mouth)

04:28.460 --> 04:30.710
-You should come too.
-Uhh...

04:31.880 --> 04:33.920
Gotta go.
Late for practice.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.580
(both speak sadly)
Bye.

04:41.170 --> 04:43.620
So close, Buffy.

04:43.620 --> 04:44.920
I know.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.830
He actually used
the word "date."

04:50.830 --> 04:54.460
I thought we were finally gonna go
do something, just the two of us.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.500
It's okay. I won't come.

04:56.500 --> 05:00.670
No. Do. If you don't, he'll just
end up inviting someone else.

05:00.670 --> 05:03.750
Well, as awesome
as that invitation sounds,

05:03.750 --> 05:06.670
I still don't want
to be a third wheel.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.120
Wait. You and Jonah
are a couple?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.750
Who can tell? We've never
used that word before,

05:11.750 --> 05:15.830
and he has so many friends that we always
end up doing everything in a group.

05:15.830 --> 05:18.000
But he still
likes you the best.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.540
Does he?

05:19.540 --> 05:21.710
Sometimes I don't know
if we're together

05:21.710 --> 05:24.750
or if we're just friends
that like holding hands

05:24.750 --> 05:27.790
and ending calls
with "No, you hang up first."

05:29.120 --> 05:30.670
Buffy:
You want half my fries?

05:30.670 --> 05:34.250
You never order them,
and you always regret it.

05:34.250 --> 05:38.250
That's okay. They taste better when I steal
them from you and you pretend not to see.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.000
(laughs)
Weirdo.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.460
(laughs)
Guilty.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.830
They forgot
your extra napkins.

05:44.830 --> 05:46.960
-I'm on it.
-Thanks.

05:51.540 --> 05:54.710
-What?
-Extra napkins.

05:54.710 --> 05:57.000
(scoffs) Everybody knows
I like extra napkins.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.920
I didn't, but obviously Marty's
been paying attention.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.000
(scoffs)

06:03.000 --> 06:06.080
Are you seriously gonna tell me
he doesn't like you?

06:06.080 --> 06:08.170
That's just how he is.

06:08.170 --> 06:10.670
He's... thoughtful.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.710
Thoughtful to you!

06:12.710 --> 06:14.250
And for the record,
why not?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.880
You guys would make
a great couple.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.710
Well, we're not a couple.

06:19.790 --> 06:21.920
But we could be one
for a day.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.710
-(indistinct dialog) -I could
bring him to the arcade,

06:23.710 --> 06:25.880
and then it would be
like a double date...

06:25.880 --> 06:27.040
which it won't be.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.670
But that way,
I won't be the third wheel.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.120
Do you think Marty
would be okay with that?

06:35.580 --> 06:38.830
Hey, I need a plus one
for the virtual reality thingee.

06:38.830 --> 06:40.710
-Wanna come?
-Yeah, cool.

06:40.710 --> 06:42.670
Just another service
we provide.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.500
(both laugh)

06:54.830 --> 06:56.250
What are you doing?

06:56.250 --> 06:58.380
I'm restocking
the nail polish.

06:58.380 --> 06:59.710
(scoffs)
In that order?

06:59.710 --> 07:02.290
I thought the visible
spectrum was a safe bet.

07:02.290 --> 07:04.540
You don't organize them
by color.

07:04.540 --> 07:06.790
You organize them
by feeling.

07:06.790 --> 07:07.790
(scoffs)

07:09.000 --> 07:11.790
It's supposed to go
"happy, fancy, flirty,

07:11.790 --> 07:13.580
edgy, angry,
dangerous."

07:13.580 --> 07:15.670
(mutters) Where do
"controlling" and "bossy" go?

07:15.670 --> 07:18.380
(chuckles)
Silly. Those aren't colors.

07:19.960 --> 07:22.120
(door opens)

07:22.120 --> 07:24.710
-Hey, Bex!
-Cyrus!

07:24.710 --> 07:26.670
Hey. Back already?

07:26.670 --> 07:28.830
I know it's soon, but I just
couldn't wait any longer.

07:28.830 --> 07:31.080
Just to set the scene
for you, it was like,

07:31.080 --> 07:33.420
"Interior: Cyrus's bedroom.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.750
Angle on: Cyrus sits on his bed,
nervously drinking milk..."

07:37.750 --> 07:39.210
(mimics slurping)

07:39.210 --> 07:42.880
"wondering what Bex thinks of his script.
Fade out."

07:43.960 --> 07:45.710
So, did you get
a chance to read it?

07:45.710 --> 07:48.580
-Yes.
-And?

07:48.580 --> 07:52.040
Uh, Cyrus, here's the thing.
I really didn't...

07:53.540 --> 07:57.880
expect... to love it
as much as I did.

07:57.880 --> 08:00.790
Really? You liked it?
What was your favorite part?

08:00.790 --> 08:05.670
Oh, um,
probably the noir mystery,

08:05.670 --> 08:08.960
the space stuff,
or how it all builds

08:08.960 --> 08:10.920
to that ping-pong match
at the end.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.790
Okay, but there must've been
something you didn't like.

08:13.790 --> 08:15.960
Was the time-traveling dog
too much?

08:15.960 --> 08:17.880
Who doesn't love
a time-traveling dog?

08:17.880 --> 08:20.210
What about at the end
when you find out

08:20.210 --> 08:22.250
that the main character
is actually twins?

08:22.250 --> 08:25.670
-Random, right? -Which is why
you never see it coming.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.750
I mean...
(mimics explosion) right?

08:27.750 --> 08:30.960
Yes! That's what I was going for!
(mimics explosion)

08:30.960 --> 08:33.830
Seriously, Cyrus, you should
be really proud of yourself.

08:33.830 --> 08:35.960
(laughs) This is
the best day ever.

08:35.960 --> 08:39.920
Oh! I feel like
Cody the Quantum Terrier

08:39.920 --> 08:42.250
when he travels to the future with
the cat-shaped fire hydrants.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.250
-Uh-huh?
-Huh? Huh?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.460
Got it.

08:49.040 --> 08:49.790
(door shuts)

08:55.580 --> 08:58.170
You look like Robo-Jonah.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.710
-Robo-nah.
-(chuckles) I like it.

09:00.710 --> 09:03.500
"Robo-nah:
Master of Beck-nology."

09:03.500 --> 09:05.710
And coming soon,
"Andi the Android."

09:05.710 --> 09:09.290
Andi the Android is definitely
one of those robot vacuums

09:09.290 --> 09:11.210
that keeps getting stuck
in the corner.

09:11.210 --> 09:15.880
-(mimics buzzing)
-(both laugh)

09:15.880 --> 09:17.420
What other appliances
do you do?

09:17.420 --> 09:20.460
All of them, but my best
is the microwave.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.920
-Wanna see?
-Yeah!

09:23.000 --> 09:26.540
-Beep, beep, beep, beep.
-(both laugh)

09:26.540 --> 09:28.960
That's also my
"truck backing up" impression.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.880
-(Buffy and Marty laugh)
-Marty: Whoa!

09:35.880 --> 09:37.540
Ooh! Watch out
for that eagle!

09:37.540 --> 09:40.500
-(laughs) Oh.
-(gasps)

09:40.500 --> 09:41.920
-That was...
-Unreal.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.960
-It was like we were...
-Actually flying.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.170
Never felt anything
like that before.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.040
-Me neither.
-(both chuckle)

09:48.040 --> 09:49.880
My heart is
still pounding.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.710
I'm so glad you invited me.

09:51.710 --> 09:54.880
-Me too.
-Why did you?

09:54.880 --> 09:57.040
Oh, because I didn't want
to be a third wheel.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.790
So, we're a fake couple?

09:59.790 --> 10:01.790
A virtual couple.

10:03.040 --> 10:05.290
-Go again?
-Goggles on.

10:05.290 --> 10:07.710
-(rock music plays)
-(chimes)

10:07.710 --> 10:09.670
-Watch out for the lava.
-I see it. Don't worry.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.540
Okay, but you're getting close
to the edge.

10:13.540 --> 10:16.540
(laughs)
Relax. I got this.

10:16.540 --> 10:19.250
-(thumps)
-I just don't want you to fall.

10:19.250 --> 10:20.830
It's a game.
I can't--

10:20.830 --> 10:22.500
whoa!

10:22.500 --> 10:24.000
(laughs)

10:27.540 --> 10:30.290
Oh my gosh.
That was hilarious.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.960
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
That was so funny.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.670
Did you hurt yourself?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.670
-No.
-Let me see your chin.

10:39.670 --> 10:42.210
-No. -You should
have an ice pack.

10:42.210 --> 10:44.500
-Let me see if they have an ice pack.
-Don't.

10:46.790 --> 10:49.580
-Are you mad at me?
-No.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.040
-(no discernible dialog)

We're gonna shoot
"Disillusionment of Souls."

12:38.830 --> 12:40.710
You said that was
a working title.

12:40.710 --> 12:43.620
It is... because it's
totally working.

12:43.620 --> 12:45.330
Even better,
it's pretentious.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.380
The Ivy League schools
love pretentious.

12:48.380 --> 12:53.540
Wait. Isn't making a whole movie
just a little bit ambitious?

12:53.540 --> 12:57.000
That's why I'm
assembling a great team,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.250
and I thought you
could be the producer,

12:59.250 --> 13:02.290
because... none of this would
be happening without you.

13:02.290 --> 13:05.250
Oh. Please,
don't put this all on me.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.250

to be the star,

13:07.250 --> 13:10.000

obvious.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.170
-Mm-hmm.

She's right. She's right.

13:23.460 --> 13:26.120
First there's
the Independent Spirit Awards.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.880
You'll wanna wear something a
little more casual for that.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.170
Buffy: What makes
you think he's mad?

13:37.170 --> 13:40.620
I sent him a text last
night, and he didn't answer.

13:40.620 --> 13:45.210
-Does he answer every text?
-I wasn't keeping track before.

13:45.210 --> 13:47.170
Well, what did
your text say?

13:47.170 --> 13:48.170
"Good night."

13:48.170 --> 13:50.880
(mock-gasps)
And he didn't respond?

13:50.880 --> 13:53.210
It's almost like
he was already asleep.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.170
He didn't answer
this morning either.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.420
Normally I'd get
at least a smiley face,

13:58.420 --> 14:01.040
but I would've been happy
with the cat face,

14:01.040 --> 14:04.290

or even the top hat.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.040
I was gonna answer, but...

14:24.210 --> 14:25.120
my phone died.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.250
Right. Right.

14:30.620 --> 14:33.000
Look, I know you've already
answered this question,

14:33.000 --> 14:36.210
but I just need to make absolutely
sure you're not mad at me.

-Marty: Same.

You might want
to tie your shoe, though.

15:04.880 --> 15:06.750
Well, since you
stopped first.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.750
Buffy: Liar! My shoes
aren't untied.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.580
I had a great time
yesterday.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.960
Yeah. It was a lot more
fun being a fake couple.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.250
I couldn't deal
with all the drama

15:15.250 --> 15:17.170
that Andi's going
through with Jonah.

15:17.170 --> 15:19.500
But you know with us,
it wouldn't be like that, right?

15:21.620 --> 15:24.670
-What? (chuckles nervously) -With
us, there wouldn't be any drama.

15:24.670 --> 15:26.330
I mean,
we're great together.

15:26.330 --> 15:29.120
Yeah, we're great together
because we're not a couple.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.330
I'm just saying...
I think we could be.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.750
And I'm just saying
I know we shouldn't be.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.580
-We have the perfect relationship.
-Not to me.

15:40.330 --> 15:41.880
I don't want it
to be fake.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.420
I want it to be real.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.750

-Twice.
-Twice...

17:11.460 --> 17:12.830
Here's what you do.

17:13.880 --> 17:15.790
You ask him one more time.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.460
Why would I do that?

17:17.460 --> 17:19.750
Because the first time
you ask,

17:19.750 --> 17:22.330
they're just saying what
they think you wanna hear.

17:22.330 --> 17:24.750
The second time,
they stand their ground

17:24.750 --> 17:26.960

lying the first time.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.210
And the third time,
you get the truth,

17:30.210 --> 17:34.420
but only because you cared
enough to ask three times.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.170
He can't tell from this?

17:40.750 --> 17:44.290
What if I bake him
some brownies?

17:44.290 --> 17:45.420
Three times.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.500
Aww. You gonna eat that?

17:59.500 --> 18:00.670
No, it's for Jonah.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.580

he's coming?

18:03.580 --> 18:05.460
He's usually here
by now.

18:05.460 --> 18:06.750
He has to come.

already ask him?

18:15.120 --> 18:18.960

the real answer until the third time.
