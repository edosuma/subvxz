WEBVTT

00:02.468 --> 00:04.437

Dude, if I have to sit
through another minute


00:04.471 --> 00:07.206

of this corny rom-com, Im
gonna do something unthinkable.


00:07.240 --> 00:09.308

Like homework.


00:09.342 --> 00:11.510

Shh. This is the best part.


00:11.544 --> 00:13.679

When I lived with Dad, the
sappiest movie we ever watched


00:13.712 --> 00:16.248

was--
oh,


00:13.712 --> 00:16.248

<i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre.</i>


00:16.282 --> 00:19.251

When you lived with Dad,
you ate Pringles for dinner


00:19.285 --> 00:21.388

and didnt have hot
water half the time.


00:21.420 --> 00:23.623

Well, Id rather freeze to death
in the shower than sit here


00:23.655 --> 00:25.557

watching white people trying
to stop other white people


00:25.591 --> 00:27.327

from getting married.


00:27.359 --> 00:30.163

Hey, I happen
to like movies about love


00:30.196 --> 00:31.830

when they make me feel
all warm and fuzzy.


00:33.198 --> 00:35.067

And anything
with The Rock in it.


00:36.402 --> 00:37.837

Especially


00:36.402 --> 00:37.837

<i>Moana.</i>


00:37.871 --> 00:40.240

Hes a sucker for romance.


00:40.273 --> 00:41.408

I love love.


00:41.441 --> 00:43.343

Clem and I are like a rom-com.


00:41.441 --> 00:43.343

Aw.


00:43.375 --> 00:45.344

The stars aligned,
destiny brought us together.


00:45.378 --> 00:46.713

I truly believe that.


00:46.746 --> 00:48.481

Thats nothing to be
embarrassed about.


00:46.746 --> 00:48.481

Of course not.


00:48.515 --> 00:50.850

Totally is. What?


00:51.917 --> 00:54.587

I think its sweet that
Nick is such a romantic.


00:54.621 --> 00:57.323

You know, he remembers
everything about us.


00:57.356 --> 00:58.658

First meal we shared?


00:58.691 --> 01:00.593

Hot dog. We ate it<i>Lady and the Tramp</i>
style.


01:00.627 --> 01:03.463

(imitating eating sounds)


01:03.496 --> 01:07.466

Well, Clems a tramp,
so I guess that makes Nick, um,


01:07.500 --> 01:09.135

yeah, the lady. Thats right.


01:10.804 --> 01:13.138

Clem knows everything there
is to know about us, too.


01:13.173 --> 01:14.307

When was our first kiss?


01:14.340 --> 01:15.542

CLEM:
Central Park,


01:15.575 --> 01:16.609

near the ice rink.
Mm-hmm.


01:16.643 --> 01:18.811

That homeless guy asked if
he can get down with us.


01:18.844 --> 01:20.646

Yuck... Thats right.


01:20.680 --> 01:22.849

Listen, its great you guys
got together and all,


01:22.882 --> 01:24.817

but I hate to break it
to you: destiny


01:24.850 --> 01:28.353

(laughs): had nothing
to do with it.


01:28.388 --> 01:30.156

If you two hadnt met
each other, you would have met


01:30.189 --> 01:31.323

other people,
and youd be saying


01:31.356 --> 01:32.825

youd be destined
to be with them.


01:32.859 --> 01:34.027

Now can we please


01:34.060 --> 01:36.795

watch something rated "R"
for extreme violence and gore?


01:36.829 --> 01:39.832

No. And if you interrupt
Sandra Bullock one more time,


01:39.865 --> 01:41.700

theres gonna be a lot
of extreme violence and gore


01:41.734 --> 01:44.236

up in here.


01:45.237 --> 01:47.240

â™ª


01:52.245 --> 01:54.180

Clem, this place
is gonna be transformed


01:54.213 --> 01:56.248

for your engagement party.


01:56.281 --> 01:59.853

Standing table here, here,
and the bar


01:59.885 --> 02:01.921

will be over there.


02:01.954 --> 02:07.260

Which means
I will be over there.


02:08.895 --> 02:11.698

Dont worry, well put up
"do not serve" posters


02:11.730 --> 02:13.299

with Shannons face
all over the bar.


02:14.967 --> 02:16.936

Well, Shannons not the guest
Im worried about.


02:16.969 --> 02:18.905

Your father has
insisted on inviting


02:18.937 --> 02:23.776

his old college buddy Joe,
and the mans in love with me.


02:23.810 --> 02:26.646

Oh, God. Here we go again.


02:26.679 --> 02:27.881

ROSE:
He is, Walt.


02:27.913 --> 02:30.216

And just because
you cant see it


02:30.250 --> 02:32.519

doesnt mean its not there.


02:32.551 --> 02:34.253

(in Irish brogue): Yeah,
like when we went to Ireland,


02:34.287 --> 02:36.456

and you swore you saw
a leprechaun?


02:38.557 --> 02:40.293

So, what are we gonna
do for music?


02:40.325 --> 02:41.760

(in normal voice): Well,
its too bad you dont know


02:41.793 --> 02:43.028

a Tony-nominated performer


02:43.062 --> 02:46.633

who could sing at the party--
oh, wait, you do. Its me. Me.


02:46.665 --> 02:47.966

ROSE:
Youre gonna be busy, Walt.


02:48.001 --> 02:51.003

Because after the cocktail hour,


02:51.037 --> 02:54.340

your father will be
hosting The Nearly-Wed Game.


02:54.373 --> 02:56.709

What the hell is
a Nearly-Wed Game?


02:56.742 --> 02:59.344

Itll be fantastic. Ill ask
Clem and Nick questions


02:59.378 --> 03:00.947

about their relationship,


03:00.979 --> 03:03.383

and then theyll compare
answers to see how well


03:03.415 --> 03:05.251

they know each other.
(gasps)
Oh.


03:05.284 --> 03:07.719

Cool. You should totally ask
about when they had a three-way


03:07.753 --> 03:09.288

with a homeless man.


03:11.024 --> 03:12.991

It was not a three-way.


03:13.026 --> 03:16.262

One person got naked,
it was not us.


03:17.462 --> 03:19.899

Okay, okay. Well, Ill
give you an example


03:19.932 --> 03:21.067

of what kind of
question I might ask.


03:21.099 --> 03:26.004

Uh, all right. What was the
name of Clems first pet?


03:26.038 --> 03:28.841

(scoffs)
Goldie the goldfish.


03:28.875 --> 03:30.610

BOTH:
May she rest in peace. Jinx!


03:30.643 --> 03:32.010

(both laugh)


03:32.045 --> 03:33.513

CLEM:
Ooh!


03:33.545 --> 03:36.014

And after the game,
I will give my speech.


03:36.049 --> 03:37.483

Its gonna be so funny.


03:37.516 --> 03:39.718

Oh, yeah? Whos gonna give it?


03:39.752 --> 03:43.590

Me. In fact, why dont I give
you a taste of the goods?


03:43.622 --> 03:44.757

(exhales)
Ooh.


03:44.790 --> 03:48.061

"They say
when you marry someone,


03:48.093 --> 03:50.729

"you marry
their whole family.


03:50.763 --> 03:55.367

Well, I hope thats not true,
because thats polygamy."


04:00.473 --> 04:03.475

Cause, cause its illegal.


04:04.911 --> 04:06.979

And thats her opener.


04:08.413 --> 04:11.884

Sweetheart,
as funny as you are,


04:11.918 --> 04:14.653

maybe you ought to try


04:14.687 --> 04:15.854

the more romantic route.


04:15.888 --> 04:17.456

Like, uh-- ooh.


04:17.490 --> 04:19.759

Tell the story
about how you and Nick met.


04:19.792 --> 04:21.060

Oh, Rose, that
is a great idea.


04:21.093 --> 04:23.062

We know you
met in a bar,


04:23.096 --> 04:24.797

but I dont think we
know the whole story.


04:24.831 --> 04:25.697

Mm-mm.


04:25.731 --> 04:28.800

The whole story?
About how


04:25.731 --> 04:28.800

<i>we</i>


04:25.731 --> 04:28.800

met?


04:28.834 --> 04:29.901

Yeah, yeah, the whole story.


04:29.935 --> 04:32.971

(laughs) Ah, no. I dont think
anyone cares about that.


04:33.005 --> 04:34.874

Oh, come on, Clem.
Just because I dont care


04:34.906 --> 04:37.843

doesnt mean nobody cares.


04:39.879 --> 04:41.113

Hey, people love
that kind of stuff.


04:41.146 --> 04:43.048

Come on. What do you say?


04:43.081 --> 04:45.384

Sure.


04:45.418 --> 04:46.519

Wonderful.


04:46.552 --> 04:47.819

I remember


04:47.853 --> 04:51.356

how your father
swept me off of my feet.


04:51.391 --> 04:55.995

It was in a hot
little jazz club in Harlem.


04:57.596 --> 05:02.134

And Joe has been
heartbroken ever since.


05:02.168 --> 05:03.670

Yeah.


05:03.702 --> 05:05.571

(in Irish brogue): And
the leprechaun disappeared


05:05.605 --> 05:07.473

into a hollow log.


05:07.507 --> 05:09.007

ROSE:
Walt.


05:09.041 --> 05:13.913

I know what I know,
and I saw what I saw.


05:23.122 --> 05:24.824

Shannon.


05:24.856 --> 05:28.728

I mean... (scoffs)
Shannon.


05:28.761 --> 05:30.997

Evan. I mean...


05:31.029 --> 05:32.999

Help.


05:33.031 --> 05:35.067

My parents are going
to the engagement party.


05:35.100 --> 05:37.603

Ill be there, too.
Are you looking forward to it?


05:37.637 --> 05:39.439

I was.


05:39.471 --> 05:41.040

Would you open the trash chute?


05:41.074 --> 05:42.709

Oh. Oh, I shouldnt.


05:42.742 --> 05:44.409

Im allergic to bees.


05:44.444 --> 05:46.678

The last time I threw out the
trash, I got stung by one.


05:46.713 --> 05:48.947

My tongue swelled up so
much that I couldnt speak.


05:48.980 --> 05:50.082

(laughs)


05:50.115 --> 05:52.117

Come on, bees. Save me.


05:54.220 --> 05:56.622

Im allergic
to basically everything.


05:56.656 --> 05:58.557

Thats why I always keep
an EpiPen in my pocket.


05:58.591 --> 06:01.194

And I thought you were
just excited to see me.


06:01.226 --> 06:02.961

Uh, I am excited to see you.


06:02.995 --> 06:05.865

Oh, Evan, you sweet little
innocent boy, you.


06:05.898 --> 06:07.567

See you, virgin.


06:07.600 --> 06:09.067

What-- what makes you think
Im a...?


06:09.101 --> 06:10.802

Mm, shes right.


06:12.504 --> 06:16.209

Ugh. Evan is so desperate.


06:16.242 --> 06:18.411

Why do you find guys like that
attractive?


06:20.245 --> 06:21.747

Excuse me?


06:21.781 --> 06:22.915

Well, you know, Nick and Evan
are, like, basically


06:22.949 --> 06:25.084

the same person,
so Im just wondering,


06:25.117 --> 06:27.552

at what age
do we start settling?


06:27.586 --> 06:30.490

Can you not right now?
Im freaking out.


06:30.523 --> 06:32.992

Im working on this speech
about how I met Nick.


06:33.024 --> 06:34.192

So?


06:34.226 --> 06:37.863

So, I dont remember
how I met Nick.


06:37.896 --> 06:39.899

What?


06:39.932 --> 06:41.199

I was super drunk,


06:41.233 --> 06:43.702

and I dont remember anything
from that night.


06:43.735 --> 06:44.836

But I guess I met him


06:44.870 --> 06:46.973

at some bar,
and he gave me his number.


06:47.005 --> 06:49.509

Wait, so you texted him, even
though you didnt remember him?


06:49.542 --> 06:51.677

Not exactly.


06:51.711 --> 06:53.980

Later that week,
I was with my bestie, Ben...


06:55.014 --> 06:57.115

Who am I going home
with tonight?


06:57.149 --> 06:58.884

Ooh.


06:58.918 --> 07:00.853

1-800-Waiter.


06:58.918 --> 07:00.853

Yes.


07:00.887 --> 07:03.088

Excuse me. Hi.


07:03.122 --> 07:07.826

Uh, could I have the... you?


07:07.860 --> 07:10.129

I get off at 10:00.


07:10.163 --> 07:12.031

Guess whos getting off
at 10:15.


07:12.064 --> 07:14.634

(chuckles)


07:14.666 --> 07:17.202

Wait, but if you leave me,
what am I gonna do?


07:17.235 --> 07:20.639

Arent you still dating that
super tall, blond dentist dude?


07:20.673 --> 07:22.507

Whats his name? Nick?


07:22.542 --> 07:25.877

Nick. Yeah, no, were not
dating, were just hooking up.


07:25.911 --> 07:29.548

He is so hot but so dumb.


07:29.581 --> 07:33.718

But since youre ditching me,
I guess I will text him.


07:33.752 --> 07:35.555

"U up?"


07:35.588 --> 07:37.055

I love how thats all it takes.


07:37.088 --> 07:39.625

Like, why would anyone
not date men?


07:39.658 --> 07:41.093

(murmurs)


07:41.127 --> 07:45.096

Wait, so Nick used to be
a super tall, blond dentist?


07:45.130 --> 07:47.966

No. Thats the whole point.


07:48.000 --> 07:50.069

I didnt remember meeting Nick,
so I didnt realize


07:50.101 --> 07:52.572

that I had two Nicks
in my phone.


07:52.605 --> 07:57.043

Oh, my God! So you booty-called
the wrong Nick.


07:58.076 --> 07:59.846

Exactly.


07:59.879 --> 08:01.613

Okay, so what happened next?


08:01.646 --> 08:03.583

Hey, Nick. Where are you?


08:03.615 --> 08:05.785

I just got here.
I dont see you.


08:05.817 --> 08:08.053

Im sitting at a table.


08:08.086 --> 08:10.189

Where?


08:10.223 --> 08:11.824

Hey.
Hi?


08:13.259 --> 08:14.927

Nick?


08:13.259 --> 08:14.927

Yeah.


08:14.961 --> 08:15.795

From the other night.


08:15.827 --> 08:17.295

Nick from the other night.


08:17.329 --> 08:19.665

I remember you.
(chuckles)


08:19.699 --> 08:21.000

Yeah.


08:21.033 --> 08:23.035

Uh, which is why I texted you.


08:23.069 --> 08:25.004

Obviously.


08:25.036 --> 08:26.338

Well, I remember, too.


08:26.372 --> 08:28.807

Which is why I showed up.


08:28.841 --> 08:30.108

Obviously.


08:30.141 --> 08:31.209

Yeah.
Here...


08:31.244 --> 08:34.046

Yeah, thank you.


08:34.080 --> 08:35.114

Wow. Uh...


08:35.147 --> 08:36.649

Are these flowers for me?


08:36.682 --> 08:37.817

These? Yeah.


08:37.850 --> 08:39.951

You know, who else
would they be for?


08:39.985 --> 08:42.788

"For my Poopkins."


08:44.155 --> 08:45.591

Poopkins?


08:45.625 --> 08:47.592

Yeah, I just...


08:47.626 --> 08:51.264

you just looked like a Poopkins,
so I, I took a swing.


08:51.297 --> 08:53.099

It-it was, it was stupid.


08:53.131 --> 08:55.600

No, it-its sweet.


08:55.634 --> 09:00.105

This whole thing
is surprisingly sweet.


09:00.139 --> 09:01.807

(laughs softly)


09:01.841 --> 09:04.744

Oh, my God, I love this story!


09:04.777 --> 09:06.879

(laughs)


09:08.179 --> 09:10.283

Its not funny, Shannon.


09:10.316 --> 09:11.783

Wait, wait, wait. Wait.
So what do you do


09:11.817 --> 09:13.052

when people ask
how you guys met?


09:13.085 --> 09:14.886

Oh, my God, whats that?


09:13.085 --> 09:14.886

What?


09:14.921 --> 09:17.056

Thats what I do.


09:17.088 --> 09:19.725

I love that the night
you guys met was so romantic


09:19.759 --> 09:23.028

that he named you Poopkins,
and you dont even remember.


09:23.062 --> 09:24.230

Ha!


09:26.365 --> 09:28.000

What am I gonna do?


09:28.033 --> 09:31.671

Tomorrow night I have to give
a speech about how we met,


09:31.703 --> 09:33.838

and if Nick finds out
that I dont remember,


09:33.873 --> 09:35.006

itll break his heart.


09:35.040 --> 09:38.878

Hey, um, you always got
the other Nick.


09:40.379 --> 09:43.115

What? Maybe hes up.


09:51.856 --> 09:53.960

Are you sure this is
the bar where I met Nick?


09:53.993 --> 09:56.028

Tell me everything
that you remember.


09:56.062 --> 09:58.397

Girl, I remember everything.


09:58.431 --> 10:00.265

Oh, thank God.


10:00.298 --> 10:02.067

I love you. Go.


10:00.298 --> 10:02.067

Okay.


10:02.100 --> 10:05.971

There was a thunderstorm, so you
looked, like, all wet and sexy.


10:07.206 --> 10:09.341

And you saw Nick from across
the room. Your eyes met,


10:09.375 --> 10:11.043

and you turned
to me and you said


10:11.076 --> 10:14.714

(imitates Clem): "That is
the man Im going to marry."


10:14.746 --> 10:16.248

Oh, I did?


10:16.282 --> 10:19.051

Mm-hmm. And as you guys walked
toward each other,


10:19.085 --> 10:21.886

it was as if everyone else
in the bar disappeared.


10:21.921 --> 10:23.188

And then you said


10:23.221 --> 10:25.057

the most romantic thing.


10:25.091 --> 10:26.125

What did I say?


10:26.158 --> 10:30.129

You said, "Im just a girl,


10:30.162 --> 10:35.000

standing in front of a boy,
asking him to love her."


10:37.937 --> 10:39.938

Thats from<i>Notting Hill.</i>


10:39.971 --> 10:42.341

I know. I love
that movie.


10:44.376 --> 10:46.245

If you dont remember
how I met Nick,


10:46.278 --> 10:47.746

why did you say
that you did?


10:47.779 --> 10:50.081

Because, ever since
you met Nicky,


10:50.115 --> 10:51.783

youre all in
love and boring,


10:51.817 --> 10:54.720

and I really miss day
drinking with you.


11:01.326 --> 11:03.028

Mmm, Rose.


11:03.062 --> 11:05.197

These little fried cheese
puffs are the bomb.


11:05.230 --> 11:06.399

How did you make these?


11:06.432 --> 11:08.299

Theyre Cheetos, Walt.


11:10.001 --> 11:12.138

Theyre Shannons.


11:12.171 --> 11:14.105

Well, shes got
terrific taste.


11:14.139 --> 11:17.208

Oh, look who
just walked in.


11:17.243 --> 11:19.144

Joe.
Oh, no.


11:19.177 --> 11:21.047

Its the competition.


11:22.048 --> 11:24.884

Laugh it up.
Youll see.


11:24.917 --> 11:26.018

Walt.
Joe!


11:26.052 --> 11:28.187

God, its good
to see you, Walt,


11:28.220 --> 11:30.022

I feel like
its been forever.
Hello, Joe.


11:30.056 --> 11:31.289

How you doing, Rose?


11:34.826 --> 11:36.261

Congratulations on
your boy getting married


11:36.294 --> 11:37.462

and-- o-oh,
there he is.


11:37.495 --> 11:39.130

Got to give
that kid a hug.


11:39.164 --> 11:41.200

Yeah. (chuckles)
Wow, Rose.


11:41.232 --> 11:44.269

That was some red-hot
knuckle-on-knuckle action.


11:48.474 --> 11:50.442

Hey, Shannon.


11:50.475 --> 11:52.043

Hey, Evan.


11:52.077 --> 11:55.181

Did you notice Ive
been ignoring you?


11:56.347 --> 11:58.951

No, but, um...


11:58.984 --> 12:00.152

keep doing it.


12:02.087 --> 12:03.822

So you dont remember
how you met.


12:03.855 --> 12:05.191

Just go out there
and talk about


12:05.224 --> 12:06.458

something else
in your speech.


12:06.491 --> 12:09.095

Do that polygamy joke
I wrote for you...


12:10.129 --> 12:11.129

Its not just about


12:11.163 --> 12:12.230

the speech, Ben.


12:12.264 --> 12:13.499

I have to tell Nick the truth.


12:13.532 --> 12:16.067

I mean... do you think
that hell understand?


12:16.101 --> 12:18.003

Of course hell understand;
he loves you.


12:18.037 --> 12:20.306

Or hell dump your ass,
and youre back to being


12:20.338 --> 12:23.075

my hot mess bestie.
Its a win-win, you know?


12:24.909 --> 12:26.111

My dads running low
on Cheetos.


12:26.144 --> 12:27.980

Oh, hey, Ben.
I didnt see you come in.


12:28.013 --> 12:29.414

Ive been hiding
out in the kitchen.


12:29.447 --> 12:32.551

Im pretty sure I had sex
with one of your cousins.


12:33.586 --> 12:35.019

I dont have a gay cousin.


12:35.053 --> 12:37.155

Oh, honey.


12:38.190 --> 12:40.158

So, Nick, I
was thinking,


12:40.192 --> 12:43.428

what if I didnt tell
the story of how we met?


12:43.461 --> 12:45.096

Babe, come on.
Everyone wants to hear.


12:45.130 --> 12:46.966

I know, its just--


12:46.999 --> 12:49.134

its... its so good.


12:49.168 --> 12:51.136

(laughs)
And it might make


12:51.169 --> 12:53.205

people feel bad about
their relationships,


12:53.239 --> 12:56.307

and... thats not what
this night is about.


12:56.341 --> 12:58.144

Clem, whats going on?


12:58.177 --> 13:00.145

I dont remember
how we met.


13:00.178 --> 13:02.181

(loud crunching)


13:08.052 --> 13:09.254

Ill take these to Daddy.


13:13.424 --> 13:16.195

You dont remember
how we met?
I was hammered.


13:16.227 --> 13:18.062

And I should have told you
but I didnt tell you


13:18.096 --> 13:20.099

and then I waited
too long and then


13:20.131 --> 13:21.033

I couldnt tell you.


13:21.066 --> 13:23.969

Im sure it was some
super romantic story,


13:24.003 --> 13:25.370

but I dont
remember any of it.


13:25.403 --> 13:26.605

Im sorry.


13:26.639 --> 13:29.575

I dont remember
how we met either.


13:29.607 --> 13:31.243

What?


13:31.277 --> 13:33.011

I was completely
wasted, too.


13:33.044 --> 13:34.245

But you never
get wasted.


13:34.279 --> 13:36.447

I had two drinks and...


13:36.481 --> 13:39.317

I was taking antibiotics
for my eye infection, so...


13:39.350 --> 13:42.388

Oh, my God, this
is such a relief.
(laughs)


13:42.421 --> 13:44.088

(sighs)
(chuckles)


13:44.123 --> 13:46.192

Wait, hang on.


13:46.225 --> 13:47.158

Quick question.


13:47.192 --> 13:48.460

If you dont
remember meeting me,


13:48.494 --> 13:51.263

then why did you rush to
see me when I texted you?


13:52.597 --> 13:54.466

And bring me flowers?


13:54.500 --> 13:58.136

Cause Im
a big ol cutie.


14:00.172 --> 14:01.673

No. No, no,
no, no, no, no.


14:01.706 --> 14:03.308

They were for
a "Poopkins."


14:03.341 --> 14:05.476

Who the hell
is Poopkins?


14:05.510 --> 14:08.246

Poopkins...


14:08.279 --> 14:11.583

was Kristen.


14:08.279 --> 14:11.583

Your ex-girlfriend?


14:11.616 --> 14:12.618

We had just broken up


14:12.650 --> 14:15.955

and I deleted her
number from my phone.
(scoffs)


14:15.988 --> 14:17.923

So, when you texted,
I thought it was Kristen


14:17.956 --> 14:19.658

trying to get back together.


14:19.692 --> 14:21.393

Wow.


14:21.427 --> 14:22.628

"Wow"?


14:22.661 --> 14:24.596

Go wow yourself,
because if you dont remember


14:24.629 --> 14:27.198

meeting me, whyd you text,
"U up?"


14:29.668 --> 14:33.371

Cause...


14:29.668 --> 14:33.371

<i>Im</i>


14:29.668 --> 14:33.371

a big ol cutie?


14:33.404 --> 14:35.139

No-no, no-no,


14:35.173 --> 14:36.508

no-no-no-no-no,
you thought


14:36.542 --> 14:38.210

you were meeting
someone different, too.


14:38.244 --> 14:39.245

Who was it?


14:39.278 --> 14:40.511

Fine, it was a different Nick.


14:40.546 --> 14:41.379

Which Nick?


14:41.413 --> 14:44.216

This dentist that I used
to hook up with.


14:44.250 --> 14:47.519

You were texting
your booty call Nick?


14:47.552 --> 14:48.988

Booty Call Nick?


14:50.288 --> 14:51.222

Unbelievable.


14:51.256 --> 14:53.359

Whats unbelievable
is that you were trying


14:53.392 --> 14:55.693

to get back together with
a woman that you loved.


14:55.727 --> 14:56.729

Well, at least I wasnt
trying to bone


14:56.761 --> 14:58.697

any random Nick
in my phone!


15:00.399 --> 15:04.535

WALT:
Its time to play
The Nearly-Wed Game!


15:04.570 --> 15:06.371

Clem and Nick, come on down!


15:14.379 --> 15:18.549

Okay, everyone, Nick and
Clem are getting married!


15:18.583 --> 15:20.586

But how well do they know
each other?


15:20.619 --> 15:22.620

Not as well
as we thought we did.


15:22.654 --> 15:24.155

(both laugh)


15:24.188 --> 15:25.658

Ill do the jokes here.


15:25.691 --> 15:27.426

All right.


15:27.458 --> 15:28.594

Heres how it works.


15:28.626 --> 15:30.261

Ill ask one of you a question,


15:30.296 --> 15:33.097

and then the other
will write down what you think


15:33.131 --> 15:34.198

your fiancÃ© will say.


15:34.232 --> 15:35.267

All right.


15:35.301 --> 15:36.434

Question number one:


15:36.467 --> 15:39.304

Nick, what is
the silliest nickname


15:39.337 --> 15:40.773

youve ever called Clem?


15:40.806 --> 15:42.774

Are you ready?


15:42.807 --> 15:44.176

Nick, what do you say?


15:44.209 --> 15:47.078

Uh, Im gonna
say "Big Toe."


15:47.111 --> 15:49.380

Because her pinky toe
looks like a thumb.


15:51.049 --> 15:52.518

Clem, what you got?


15:53.552 --> 15:56.288

"Poopkins."


15:56.322 --> 15:58.123

(imitates buzzer)
Sorry, 0 for 1.


15:58.157 --> 16:00.759

All right, next question.


16:00.793 --> 16:04.697

Clem, what would Nick say
was the best vacation


16:04.730 --> 16:06.230

you guys ever took?


16:06.264 --> 16:08.767

Nick, to your board.
All right, Clem.


16:08.801 --> 16:11.602

Best vacation,
whats your answer?


16:12.705 --> 16:15.541

I dont know,
some Airbnb in Bridgeport.


16:15.573 --> 16:18.443

Well, its not Paris,
but you guys are still young.


16:18.476 --> 16:19.711

Nick!


16:19.745 --> 16:21.613

Show me Bridgeport!


16:22.648 --> 16:25.451

"Ask her about
Booty Call Nick."


16:28.653 --> 16:31.123

Okay, um...
(chuckles)


16:31.155 --> 16:32.290

I think Im done
with this game.


16:32.323 --> 16:34.692

No-no, no-no.
We are not done here.


16:34.726 --> 16:36.260

Whoa, son, son.


16:36.294 --> 16:37.696

Whats going on?
Are you guys okay?


16:37.730 --> 16:40.331

I just always
thought we were...


16:40.365 --> 16:41.700

like one of those great
couples from the movies


16:41.734 --> 16:43.302

who were destined
to be together.


16:43.335 --> 16:46.538

Turns out, were not.


16:46.572 --> 16:48.639

ROSE:
But...


16:48.673 --> 16:50.375

Uh...


16:48.673 --> 16:50.375

All right, give me the mic.


16:50.408 --> 16:51.309

Im making the speech.


16:51.342 --> 16:54.046

Uh, do I need to warn
the church people?


16:54.846 --> 16:57.081

Hello, old people.


16:59.183 --> 17:00.418

Im Clems sister, Shannon.


17:00.451 --> 17:02.421

Oh, God. What is she doing?


17:02.453 --> 17:04.690

See, Clem was supposed
to give a speech tonight


17:04.722 --> 17:06.157

about how her and Nick met.


17:06.191 --> 17:07.393

But the problem is,


17:07.425 --> 17:08.760

she doesnt remember anything
about that night


17:08.794 --> 17:10.261

because she was a drunk mess.


17:11.864 --> 17:13.332

Because she used to be fun.


17:13.365 --> 17:15.800

Ill drink to that.


17:15.834 --> 17:17.803

And Nick here doesnt remember
anything either


17:17.836 --> 17:19.837

because hes a little baby
who cant handle


17:19.872 --> 17:21.740

a Z-Pak and a Chardonnay.


17:23.474 --> 17:25.676

And that could have been
the end of the story, but no.


17:25.711 --> 17:26.811

(scoffs)


17:26.845 --> 17:28.579

Destiny brought them
back together.


17:28.614 --> 17:30.615

Come on, guys, seriously,
think about it.


17:30.648 --> 17:32.718

Think about all the stars
that had to align


17:32.750 --> 17:33.719

to make this happen.


17:33.751 --> 17:36.587

Nick had to have been
pathetically obsessing


17:36.622 --> 17:38.490

over his ex and Clem had to have


17:38.523 --> 17:40.459

accidentally texted
the wrong guy


17:40.491 --> 17:42.361

because she was horny
for man meat-- its beautiful.


17:43.362 --> 17:46.265

Its beautiful.


17:46.298 --> 17:48.133

You two are exactly
like those lame couples


17:48.166 --> 17:49.801

in those stupid rom-coms
you love.


17:49.835 --> 17:51.836

Dude, its such a clichÃ©.
The gay best friend.


17:51.869 --> 17:55.740

The cynical sister
who makes the dope speech


17:55.773 --> 17:57.643

that brings the couple
back together.


17:59.278 --> 18:01.180

Heres to Nick and Clem...


18:01.212 --> 18:02.847

who made me believe in destiny.


18:04.182 --> 18:05.817

Blech.


18:07.786 --> 18:09.387

See?


18:09.421 --> 18:10.655

We<i>were</i>


18:09.421 --> 18:10.655

meant to be.


18:10.689 --> 18:11.856

I know.


18:11.890 --> 18:13.592

Were just a pair
of big ol cuties.


18:13.625 --> 18:14.826

(chuckles)


18:16.228 --> 18:17.528

Youre welcome.


18:21.834 --> 18:23.167

Rose.


18:23.201 --> 18:25.203

Joe.
I got to tell you


18:25.237 --> 18:27.506

that what the kids
said really got to me.


18:27.538 --> 18:29.641

Oh.
You are my destiny.


18:29.674 --> 18:30.808

And Ive always
loved you.


18:30.843 --> 18:32.478

Can you say
that to Walt?


18:33.511 --> 18:36.214

No. No. Oh, no.


18:33.511 --> 18:36.214

What...


18:38.817 --> 18:41.752

Well, can you text me?
So I can have proof.


18:45.523 --> 18:46.692

I heard your speech.


18:46.724 --> 18:49.394

You know, in every rom-com,
the cynical girl


18:49.427 --> 18:51.563

always winds up
with the lovable loser.


18:51.596 --> 18:53.397

Thats me.


18:53.432 --> 18:55.867

Yeah, I dont think so, kid.


18:55.901 --> 18:58.670

Oh, but, um, come here.


18:58.703 --> 19:00.838

If you steal me
a couple beers,


19:00.873 --> 19:02.607

Ill let you get
to zero base.


19:02.641 --> 19:04.643

Whats zero base?


19:04.675 --> 19:06.444

Its where nothing happens,


19:06.478 --> 19:08.646

but you get to watch me
drink beers.


19:08.680 --> 19:10.249

Sold!


19:18.789 --> 19:20.224

Theyre so cute.


19:20.259 --> 19:21.593

Were gonna be
like them some day.


19:21.626 --> 19:22.661

I hope so.


19:22.693 --> 19:24.829

You know, at least
well never forget


19:24.863 --> 19:26.698

the night
that we met because...


19:26.731 --> 19:28.767

we dont remember it.


19:28.799 --> 19:31.903

Well, if it was anything
like our relationship,


19:31.936 --> 19:34.605

it was probably the most
magical night of all time.


19:36.708 --> 19:37.942

Yo, dude.


19:37.976 --> 19:39.677

My girlfriend broke up
with me tonight.


19:39.711 --> 19:41.779

(laughs) I dont care.


19:43.548 --> 19:44.782

I dont.


19:44.816 --> 19:47.286

I am totally over it.


19:47.318 --> 19:50.255

I am... moving on.


19:50.288 --> 19:51.823

Good for you.


19:51.856 --> 19:53.892

I even deleted
her phone number.


19:53.925 --> 19:58.529

(voice breaking): So I can
never call Poopkins again.


19:58.564 --> 20:00.432

Lets go.


20:01.866 --> 20:03.568

(gasps)


20:03.602 --> 20:06.672

The drink fairy left me a drink.


20:06.704 --> 20:08.740

Hey, thats mine.


20:08.773 --> 20:10.342

Whoa-- Oh, youre hot.


20:10.375 --> 20:12.510

I mean, its

20:12.544 --> 20:13.878

And youre hot.


20:13.912 --> 20:16.013

Im so sweaty.


20:16.048 --> 20:19.684

Oh, my God.
Are you crying?
No.


20:19.718 --> 20:21.053

I have an eye infection.


20:21.086 --> 20:22.621

Can I have your number?


20:24.855 --> 20:26.991

Why dont... you give me yours?


20:27.025 --> 20:28.727

Okay.


20:30.061 --> 20:31.395

20:31.430 --> 20:32.463

20:32.497 --> 20:35.634

Hey, thats me.


20:37.669 --> 20:39.438

Okay, bye.


20:41.038 --> 20:43.040

20:43.075 --> 20:46.044

You gonna call
that dude?
(scoffs)


20:46.077 --> 20:48.079

The crying one?
(laughs)


20:48.113 --> 20:50.949

Im never gonna see
that guy ever again.


20:50.982 --> 20:52.884
