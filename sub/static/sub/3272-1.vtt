00:40.193 --> 00:45.190
A long time ago, when
mankind was still in its cradle,

00:45.192 --> 00:51.191
visitors came from the sky.
They were called the Osiris.

00:51.191 --> 00:54.090
These gods gave us
unimaginable gifts.

00:54.091 --> 00:58.190
The lights of which we had
never dreamed of before.

00:58.190 --> 01:03.190
Astronomy, architecture, culture.

01:04.188 --> 01:08.189
But all these came at a price.

01:08.989 --> 01:12.788
The Osiris wanted earth for themselves.

01:12.888 --> 01:17.885
The Pharaoh, the greatest man of all,
together with the God of Sunlight Ra

01:17.887 --> 01:21.187
opposed this threat to their people.

01:21.787 --> 01:25.786
Just when the visitors prepared
to summon their kin to come to Earth

01:25.886 --> 01:30.186
an opportunity arising only
once every 5000 years,

01:30.286 --> 01:33.085
when the stars align
in the right order

01:33.185 --> 01:37.885
the Pharaoh stole the light from the
Osiris, blinding them with its brilliance,

01:37.985 --> 01:40.184
leaving them in prison,
in a dungeon

01:40.284 --> 01:44.183
hidden in the labyrinth
below his pyramid.

01:46.783 --> 01:49.380
But some still believed
in the visitors way

01:49.383 --> 01:54.383
and prepared for the time of their return.
So did the Princess Amanphur.

01:58.782 --> 02:04.783
Take the baby and run from here.
He is the last of the bloodline.

02:07.382 --> 02:09.035
Give thanks to the Gods.

02:09.035 --> 02:12.467
The worship of Osiris
will be buried with her.

02:12.781 --> 02:14.981
Praise for her journey
to the next world.

02:15.081 --> 02:19.861
She will be laid to rest
in the glory of Ra.

02:21.781 --> 02:25.770
Without the Pharaoh's knowledge,
very deep below the princess's

02:25.771 --> 02:29.069
pyramid grave,
a gate was constructed...

02:29.069 --> 02:31.582
When the stars align once more...

02:31.781 --> 02:37.114
the visitors would again be welcomed by
a descendant of the Princess's bloodline...

02:39.218 --> 02:43.004
But the Pharaoh mistrusted
his princess even in death.

02:43.004 --> 02:46.063
So he made a key.
The Key of Heaven

02:46.063 --> 02:49.827
to lock in tightly whatever secrets
she may have kept from him.

02:50.779 --> 02:54.779
A guardian was created
to protect the tomb.

02:57.779 --> 03:02.778
And he made sure that no one would
tell the secrets of the tomb buildings

03:02.778 --> 03:06.379
so that Osiris could never return.

03:06.479 --> 03:10.278
But if they did, their
revenge would be terrible.

03:10.378 --> 03:16.775
A rain of fire would scorch the Earth and
every man, woman and child would die.

03:16.778 --> 03:23.777
Only loyal servants of the Osiris would be
rewarded and turned into Gods themselves.

03:25.777 --> 03:28.477
The stars are approaching
their alignment.

03:28.577 --> 03:33.777
But the Key of Heaven has been lost,
the bloodline seems to have vanished,

03:33.777 --> 03:37.776
until now.

04:09.774 --> 04:12.500
You're late.
It is the traffic again, huh?

04:12.600 --> 04:15.569
Oh, what can I say,
it was horrible.

04:15.965 --> 04:17.423
But you look beautiful!

04:17.488 --> 04:21.063
I'm sweating and I'm dusty. Too many
hours playing Tomb Raider, Mr. Adler...

04:21.774 --> 04:23.940
-  Where is he?
-  In the tent.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.919
Take a look at this
before you go see him ...

04:31.086 --> 04:32.326
Beautiful !

04:33.420 --> 04:34.574
You are amazing!

04:34.575 --> 04:36.182
Against the risks...

04:47.772 --> 04:49.155
7 days.

04:50.663 --> 04:55.735
They built these pyramids to mirror
exactly what they saw in the heavens...

04:55.772 --> 04:59.262
That mirror image only reappeared
once every 5000 years...

05:00.885 --> 05:05.671
In seven days time,
the image will be complete again.

05:05.771 --> 05:09.831
I checked again last night with
Mendella. They found nothing.

05:09.866 --> 05:11.106
Tell him to widen the search area.

05:11.150 --> 05:13.802
Tell him money is now no object.

05:13.803 --> 05:14.988
We're running out of time.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.370
We're late for Khalfani.

05:16.372 --> 05:19.352
Oh, got to get on dealing
with that thieving goat...

05:19.353 --> 05:20.365
Get the driver.

05:22.770 --> 05:26.770
Yep,  Masterton here.
No, that's not what I wanted.

05:26.770 --> 05:33.617
I want it tomorrow. Not to next
week not next month. Tomorrow!

05:34.769 --> 05:38.232
Masterton has confirmed the date.
Exactly in one week.

05:41.769 --> 05:44.068
We have to find the entrance.

05:44.768 --> 05:48.169
You know the tombs, right? I do not
understand why we can't locate it.

05:48.269 --> 05:51.168
It's here.
It has to be.

05:53.668 --> 05:57.968
We need to extend the dig. You organise
the lights so we can work through the night.

05:58.068 --> 06:03.968
They're being delivered today. The bad
news is, there is a storm coming in.

06:04.068 --> 06:07.567
- Oh great.
- Let's go inside.

06:20.666 --> 06:24.767
You look tired, Professor.
Have you eaten today?

06:26.766 --> 06:29.766
Too hot.

06:36.766 --> 06:40.565
- You got it...
- You do not want to know how.

06:40.965 --> 06:44.765
Why are museum staff
so damn stuffy?

06:44.865 --> 06:49.797
Living with relics. Our people
will start looking like their dogs...

06:52.997 --> 06:55.163
This is strange.

06:55.364 --> 06:58.664
Now you tell me that is not
a visiting ship of some kind?

06:59.764 --> 07:04.764
It could be the symbol of a flying god.

07:05.664 --> 07:08.400
You know, Egypt changed
so fast at this time that

07:08.413 --> 07:11.160
no man's aware that is
a great civilization.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.563
No chance for us alright...

07:13.692 --> 07:20.763
Like today. Just like today, cynics
will regard you as a bit of a crank.

07:21.763 --> 07:26.763
Why, I'm as cynical as the best of them. I'm
telling you something strange went on here.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.659
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.460
The Key of Heaven.

08:29.758 --> 08:31.759
That's very particular.

08:33.759 --> 08:37.758
You have it, I want it.
We do business?

08:40.658 --> 08:46.458
You understand however, another
interested party willing to pay handsomely.

08:46.658 --> 08:50.457
So tonight, the item would
want the most serious offer...

08:50.557 --> 08:52.858
I am a most serious man.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.257
And you would be?

09:08.657 --> 09:14.244
Mr. Levitz, come with me.
I trust no one followed you here.

09:14.744 --> 09:16.525
Nobody got anywhere near me.

09:17.756 --> 09:20.756
Do you know the legend
of the Key of Heaven?

09:20.756 --> 09:25.855
Yes, it was handed down since Egyptian times
by a sect of priests, until it went missing.

09:25.955 --> 09:30.955
Lost. Lost, Mr. Levitz
in the midst of time.

09:31.055 --> 09:34.555
Rumoured to be linked to the
mysterious Princess Amanphur.

09:34.755 --> 09:37.454
How do I know it's genuine?

09:38.654 --> 09:41.755
How do I know you can
afford such a treasure?

10:05.753 --> 10:12.752
Ah, masterpieces, sculpture.
A miracle of survival.

10:13.252 --> 10:16.753
You know that Hitler once sent
archaeologists here to search it,

10:17.453 --> 10:20.052
but it remained hidden until now.

10:20.752 --> 10:23.719
These are the Carbon testing results.

10:24.918 --> 10:27.440
That he invite you,
it is priceless, Mr. Levitz?

10:29.752 --> 10:32.851
- What about you?
- Let me see it first.

10:42.651 --> 10:47.750
Well worth double the price.
I'm sure you'll agree.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.550
I had in mind a trade.

10:52.850 --> 10:57.850
This fine stick... 19th century.

11:01.849 --> 11:04.750
You must be joking.

11:07.649 --> 11:12.749
I rarely joke.
I am a most serious man.

11:47.346 --> 11:49.431
Mr Khalfani?

11:59.746 --> 12:02.746
Oh, Jesus!

12:07.745 --> 12:08.733
Masterton

12:08.746 --> 12:11.645
- I understand you seek a certain key.
- Levitz?

12:11.745 --> 12:15.445
- Well, it just changed hands.
- You murdering bastard.

12:15.545 --> 12:18.845
Do tell me where you are. I'm not going
to call the police and have you arrested.

12:19.045 --> 12:22.444
On the way.
Should be with you any minute.

12:22.544 --> 12:24.583
That beautiful walking stick
that killed him is yours.

12:24.596 --> 12:26.645
It has your fingerprints
all over it.

12:26.646 --> 12:30.945
Well, motivation is
clearly proven, Professor.

12:31.045 --> 12:34.425
Fine. What do you want?
Money?

12:35.325 --> 12:41.466
Money? How undignified.
I want participation.

12:42.444 --> 12:45.643
Or your walking stick goes
to the police with a witness.

12:45.744 --> 12:47.744
You won't get away with this.

12:52.545 --> 12:55.275
What do we do?

12:56.544 --> 13:00.545
Claire, I need your advice.

13:16.045 --> 13:19.422
You're gonna have to leave.
The storm is coming.

13:19.522 --> 13:21.003
Well, keep going!

13:21.444 --> 13:26.740
We can predict a storm. No, not this one.
The big one is coming. Look for yourself!

13:27.745 --> 13:31.450
We'll take everything down.
I'll give you a hand!

13:31.550 --> 13:33.021
OK, let's go!

13:35.445 --> 13:37.444
Oh, for God's sake!

13:58.844 --> 14:01.244
Stay in the car.

14:17.844 --> 14:20.644
Someone around you just died?

14:22.544 --> 14:25.143
This follow the things
I came to talk to you about.

14:26.843 --> 14:29.644
This storm is not an accident.

14:33.444 --> 14:35.944
The secret is revealed.

14:40.443 --> 14:43.543
You were given something.

14:43.643 --> 14:45.943
A key.

14:48.544 --> 14:52.543
You will complete your
mission in the next days.

14:56.244 --> 15:01.443
A great bird Sophus...
Swimmer in the blood of men...

15:01.643 --> 15:03.743
There's fire.

15:04.443 --> 15:07.943
- There's fire.  It will be again.
- What is it, Claire?

15:08.043 --> 15:12.443
The signs of Osiris risen...
The signs of Osiris dead...

15:12.543 --> 15:15.543
- I must know.
- No!

15:23.343 --> 15:27.542
Claire, what is it?
I need to know.

15:30.543 --> 15:33.543
Nothing.
Just a bad dream.

15:35.543 --> 15:39.443
I leave you now.
You've been very helpful.

15:51.543 --> 15:56.543
Yes, of course, I told him.
On his way now. Yes.

15:57.143 --> 15:58.442
What does he mean?

15:58.443 --> 16:00.543
Professor Mendella insists
you see for yourself.

16:00.742 --> 16:03.697
Very well then.
Let us see for ourselves.

16:17.542 --> 16:21.542
- What is it this time?
- Not expect you to believe?

16:22.542 --> 16:24.242
What have you got for me?

16:26.542 --> 16:28.943
Look what the storm uncovered.

16:33.543 --> 16:35.642
We thought it was all over.

16:43.842 --> 16:45.942
I knew it.

16:50.842 --> 16:54.543
Old friend, can you find
the entrance for me?

16:54.843 --> 16:57.942
My dear man, we
have already started.

17:00.542 --> 17:03.541
Assemble the rest of the team.
Call Sarah, in London.

17:03.841 --> 17:06.642
Tell her, her father needs her.

17:11.541 --> 17:16.516
Masterton! Professor Mendella is
exhausted. You can see for yourself.

17:16.942 --> 17:19.057
He hasn't slept in weeks.

17:20.541 --> 17:22.775
Can we delay it?
He needs to rest.

17:22.875 --> 17:28.780
Dr. Adler! That pyramid is
an Astronomical Observatory

17:28.815 --> 17:34.542
dedicated to a celestial event
that occurs once every 5000 years.

17:34.742 --> 17:40.542
The next occurrence is at 12:37,
on Thursday, the 12th of this month.

17:40.842 --> 17:44.641
Three days. Three days Dr. Adler.

17:44.941 --> 17:49.242
I will be inside that
pyramid in three days!

18:15.542 --> 18:19.441
Have a look at it.
I've deciphered what I can.

18:20.541 --> 18:24.240
Some panels damaged, some missing.

18:24.440 --> 18:28.841
Are you alright?
Time to get you home.

18:29.441 --> 18:34.967
- Got to prepare for tomorrow
- We'll pack it in for tonight.

18:57.541 --> 18:59.868
I really do not feel so good.

19:00.756 --> 19:03.859
Maybe I can persuade
Masterton to delay a few days...

19:05.044 --> 19:12.011
It would be preferable, but he's calculated
his timing from his astrological studies.

19:13.341 --> 19:15.352
He won't change.

19:16.541 --> 19:17.870
All right.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.540
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:59.540 --> 20:01.340
Your client is here.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.539
Went to see the new pyramid?

20:09.539 --> 20:11.641
Amazing, isn't it?

20:12.541 --> 20:14.613
Do you watch me clap as well?

20:15.900 --> 20:19.354
Ah my friend, this is a mysterious
country. Oh, you should know that...

20:19.540 --> 20:25.440
You married a beautiful Egyptian woman.
People have a habit of disappearing.

20:25.540 --> 20:31.328
- I'm just protecting my investment.
- And what would that investment be?

20:31.540 --> 20:33.540
Ici ...

20:36.540 --> 20:39.540
Au revoir.

20:40.540 --> 20:45.539
The Key of Heaven.
Without it, you can't enter the tomb.

20:45.539 --> 20:49.139
I too have been researching the legend
of the Sun God for some years now...

20:49.239 --> 20:50.940
I will buy it off.
You name your price.

20:50.941 --> 20:53.341
<i>I have money up front.
I don't need that Masterton.</i>

20:53.440 --> 20:57.540
If the legend is true, this pyramid being
exposed would seem to confirm things.

20:57.541 --> 21:00.441
There are riches beyond
belief buried in there.

21:00.540 --> 21:02.439
This is my mission.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.940
Well, I'm coming with you,
whether you like it or not.

21:05.539 --> 21:08.239
I am following an
explicit set of instructions

21:08.240 --> 21:11.440
that were laid down
over 5000 years ago.

21:11.639 --> 21:15.039
- There is no place for you in...
- There is now.

21:15.539 --> 21:18.439
The walking stick with
your fingerprints all over it

21:18.440 --> 21:20.440
is approaching the
police station as we speak.

21:20.539 --> 21:26.539
Now, if I don't call my man in a...
let's see..  three minutes...

21:26.539 --> 21:29.438
The delivery takes place
and bye-bye pyramid.

21:29.439 --> 21:30.439
You're bluffing.

21:30.538 --> 21:32.949
Khalfani didn't think so.

21:34.540 --> 21:40.054
Only tomb you're likely to visit is
your own in a Cairo prison cell.

21:40.539 --> 21:43.538
Not a good place to be.

21:46.339 --> 21:50.538
Bring the key and my stick to my
office tomorrow and you can come...

21:50.638 --> 21:56.338
Yah and the key over inside
when we enter together.

21:56.438 --> 22:00.945
Stick stays with me.
Stop the delivery.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.424
Professor?

22:26.238 --> 22:27.679
Professor?

22:36.839 --> 22:38.458
Professor!

22:39.838 --> 22:41.575
Professor.

22:50.938 --> 22:53.538
- Come on.
- Oh. It's all right.

22:54.538 --> 22:56.539
It's all right.

23:02.538 --> 23:04.900
- I'm okay.
- You're not okay.

23:05.837 --> 23:11.538
Look Doug. You've studied
with me for over 4 years now.

23:11.838 --> 23:13.378
<i>You will have to go.</i>

23:13.379 --> 23:15.879
I don't have a millionth of
your experience, you know.

23:15.880 --> 23:16.980
<i>How can I go?</i>

23:17.038 --> 23:22.138
You belittle yourself. You've got a
very strong instinct for this field.

23:23.538 --> 23:30.759
Let's go back to your basic knowledge. You
can decipher this, you've done it before.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.438
- I'm calling it off.
- It has to be tomorrow.

23:36.538 --> 23:41.237
You know what Masterton said
about the position of Earth...

23:41.437 --> 23:44.538
There is more to this
pyramid than meets the eye.

23:44.738 --> 23:48.137
It's not just the burial place
of princess Amanphur.

23:48.138 --> 23:50.838
That is a cloak.
It is part of the mystery.

23:52.837 --> 23:54.538
Look.

23:55.438 --> 23:59.337
The symbols suggest Osiris.

24:00.537 --> 24:03.535
You have to go.

24:03.840 --> 24:10.178
Don't worry... I'll survive.
I promise.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.537
You'd better.

24:17.538 --> 24:19.350
- You must be Sarah?
- Yes

24:19.450 --> 24:22.723
I'm Ahmed. Your father sent me.
He's looking for you at the office.

24:22.823 --> 24:25.621
- Is the rest of the team here?
- The rest coming tonight.

24:40.337 --> 24:41.913
Sarah...

24:45.337 --> 24:49.458
- It's been too long.
- You knew where I was.

24:50.436 --> 24:55.537
Yes. Since your mother died, things
been a little frantic around here.

24:57.537 --> 25:01.536
I'd to visit her grave
before we begin.

25:02.336 --> 25:04.037
Welcome.

25:34.536 --> 25:37.536
Mama, I'm here.

25:40.637 --> 25:44.236
You always sang a song for me
when I couldn't sleep.

25:44.436 --> 25:46.336
Do you remember?

25:49.535 --> 25:55.337
That the great Princess Amanphur
and her fantastic kingdom.

25:55.537 --> 26:00.436
And the one day, when
the rain turned into fire.

26:04.536 --> 26:08.336
But the Princess's children
wouldn't have to fear a thing.

26:08.536 --> 26:13.535
And you called me little princess.
I liked that.

26:14.736 --> 26:19.536
Now I'll find what happened to you.
I promise.

26:31.535 --> 26:34.453
Hi, can you tell me where
the conference room is, please?

26:34.454 --> 26:36.662
- Yes, I'll check for you, sir.
- Thank you.

26:51.355 --> 26:52.453
Dr. Adler...

26:52.553 --> 26:56.436
This is Miss Masterton.
I cannot seem to find Professor Mendella.

26:56.536 --> 26:59.335
My father arranged for him
meet up for a drink at his villa.

26:59.336 --> 27:01.336
You think you could
get him there now?

27:01.536 --> 27:05.531
Oh, he is rather tired. Is there anyway
we can delay the meeting a few hours?

27:05.535 --> 27:09.534
My father didn't fly me halfway across
the world, for me to wait one's sleep.

27:09.535 --> 27:11.534
The villa in half an hour.

27:23.535 --> 27:25.546
Dr. Adler.

27:27.535 --> 27:28.976
- Hi.

27:28.977 --> 27:31.170
I thought I was a little sort
with you on the phone earlier

27:31.176 --> 27:36.144
So I called to apologize and I
saw you answer. Where is Mendella?

27:36.836 --> 27:39.035
Can we talk for a moment?

27:39.036 --> 27:41.436
I don't have much time.
My father expects me in a few minutes.

27:41.735 --> 27:46.534
Professor Mendella is in the hospital.
He is critical.

27:47.344 --> 27:50.405
He had a heart attack, and he
asked me to come in his place.

27:51.535 --> 27:56.030
With all due respect, Dr. Adler,
you hardly qualify.

27:56.034 --> 27:58.935
Mendella's been working
with my father for years.

27:59.035 --> 28:04.509
Plus, he is unique in his field.
You, what are you?

28:06.534 --> 28:09.534
I guess you'll never know, will you?

28:22.734 --> 28:26.860
Sarah, this is Adam.
He'll be working with us.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.534
He helped to set this up.

28:30.534 --> 28:35.334
I've heard so much about you.
And of course, your mother.

28:35.534 --> 28:41.169
- Really?
- I must go to the hotel, meet the others.

28:44.734 --> 28:48.334
- Who is he?
- I'll fill you in later.

28:48.434 --> 28:52.207
- Did you find Mendella?
- He is not coming.

28:52.307 --> 28:55.701
He had a heart attack.
He is in intensive care.

28:55.902 --> 28:59.202
Look, he did send his assistant along.
A Dr. Adler.

28:59.535 --> 29:02.793
- Where is he?
- I was of sorts, I think I upset him.

29:02.794 --> 29:03.594
He left.

29:03.634 --> 29:06.568
Does this Dr. Adler know anything?

29:06.569 --> 29:10.343
He has worked closely with Professor
Mendella for the last 4 years...

29:10.734 --> 29:14.520
True and Professor Mendella
doesn't suffer fools.

29:15.533 --> 29:18.534
This could be a disaster.

29:24.534 --> 29:26.933
I was a little rude back there.

29:27.034 --> 29:30.134
Look Ms Masterton, I don't want view
this anymore than you want me to view.

29:30.433 --> 29:33.307
- That's not the point, Mr. Adler.
- It's Doctor.

29:33.407 --> 29:37.533
Doctor can you come and join us at
the private bar at the Sphinx Hotel?

29:37.633 --> 29:41.401
I'm really sorry I was rude,
I had no place to be.

29:43.533 --> 29:45.096
Well I'm a ...

29:52.076 --> 29:55.872
- I'll be there
- Accepted.

30:08.534 --> 30:13.478
A very beautiful sky this morning,
and yet you all look at me.

30:17.532 --> 30:20.416
I am Professor Rohit Singh,
from India.

30:20.416 --> 30:24.097
- And you must be...
- Doug Adler.

30:24.098 --> 30:26.398
You must be the antiquities expert.

30:26.533 --> 30:31.213
Antiquities and future.
Where is Professor Mendella?

30:32.133 --> 30:36.033
Every piece of the jigsaw
puzzle is now on board.

30:36.133 --> 30:39.533
- Rohit
- Professor Masterton.

30:39.733 --> 30:41.046
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

30:41.187 --> 30:42.797
All present and correct.

30:44.433 --> 30:48.533
With the exception of Professor Mendella
who sadly cannot be with us today.

30:48.733 --> 30:52.332
- Professor Masterton... I'm sorry...
- Where is Mendella?

30:52.532 --> 30:55.835
Mendella suffered a heart attack
in the early hour of the morning.

30:55.936 --> 30:57.436
Oh my God.

30:57.732 --> 31:03.433
His ability to decipher the indecipherable
has been of immense value to my studies.

31:03.533 --> 31:09.332
However, Dr. Adler here
has been Mendella's assistant

31:09.333 --> 31:11.433
and he has volunteered
to take his place.

31:11.532 --> 31:15.132
Excuse me, Professor Masterton.

31:15.133 --> 31:18.433
Professor Mendella is the
foremost authority in his field.

31:18.632 --> 31:23.542
And for this journey
we need an expert.

31:23.577 --> 31:26.532
Yes. Well we shall just have to
make do with what we have.

31:26.632 --> 31:31.532
Dr. Adler has worked with Professor
Mendella for the past 4 years...

31:31.632 --> 31:36.513
He is far better qualified than some crusty
historian we dig up at the last minute.

31:36.613 --> 31:37.949
Hear. Hear.

31:39.432 --> 31:42.533
It must be wonderful to carry
all your knowledge in your head.

31:43.233 --> 31:48.432
Some must be surprised not to see you
weighed down with research material.

31:48.532 --> 31:53.532
I don't see your back bent on the
terrible strain of credentials, Mr Levitz..

31:53.532 --> 32:00.432
If I may be so bold as to ask you what
bought you your passage on this journey?

32:00.532 --> 32:04.132
Well it takes more than
knowledge to violate history.

32:04.232 --> 32:05.132
Violate.

32:05.133 --> 32:08.433
If we were to dig up Queen Victoria,
it would be called violate, do we not?

32:08.532 --> 32:12.031
Well, it depends what
you plan on doing with her.

32:14.431 --> 32:19.631
My friends, everyone of you
is necessary for this expedition.

32:21.232 --> 32:23.332
Every single one.

32:23.432 --> 32:27.532
Now today, we shall go
deeper into the history

32:27.533 --> 32:30.333
of this mysterious land
than any has gone before.

32:30.532 --> 32:35.531
I believe that what we will find
will change history.

32:36.531 --> 32:40.532
- To Egypt
- Cheers.

33:05.532 --> 33:09.172
- Something wrong?
- These soldiers.

33:10.335 --> 33:12.048
They weren't here yesterday...

33:29.531 --> 33:30.650
Magnificent, isn't it?

33:32.310 --> 33:33.701
Shrouded in mystery.

33:33.801 --> 33:36.511
My father set his whole life for this.

33:36.611 --> 33:38.440
And with you to help him.

33:38.531 --> 33:42.431
No it's my first trip with him.
My mother brought me up alone.

33:42.531 --> 33:48.587
- Yeah. You chose this profession.
- To look for things long lost?

33:49.530 --> 33:52.921
Psychiatrists would have
field day with that, wouldn't they?

33:53.622 --> 33:54.522
Yeah.

33:57.630 --> 34:01.131
Mr Sahid here is a representative
of the Egyptian Government.

34:01.231 --> 34:04.031
He would like to address
you, hopefully briefly,

34:04.032 --> 34:07.332
on the miracle that has given
this mystery back to the world.

34:07.531 --> 34:12.330
Professor Masterton speaks of a miracle,
yet how close it was to a disaster.

34:12.429 --> 34:17.429
Oh come now Sahid. You should have more
faith in the ancient Gods of Egypt.

34:17.630 --> 34:20.572
This was intended.

34:21.531 --> 34:27.331
The biggest sandstorm
in history uncovered

34:27.531 --> 34:34.530
the resting of what we believe,
is the tomb of Princess Amanphur.

34:34.530 --> 34:39.429
When the rest of the world
was huddling in caves, this stood.

34:39.530 --> 34:43.530
When Christ was being crucified
it was already under the sand.

34:43.730 --> 34:49.431
When Christopher Columbus was sailing
the oceans, it was hidden, waiting.

34:49.531 --> 34:53.429
Waiting for us.

34:53.530 --> 34:58.529
We camp here tonight,
we enter the tomb at dawn.

35:21.429 --> 35:24.108
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.431
Want some tea?

35:41.529 --> 35:45.119
Here I am, and I don't
even know my own father.

35:46.529 --> 35:49.930
Or maybe this is your chance.
I mean he asked you to come, didn't he?

35:50.530 --> 35:54.529
Not because he wanted me,
because he needed me.

35:56.529 --> 36:02.145
- I never liked him.
- We don't choose our parents, Sarah.

36:02.530 --> 36:04.633
Sometimes we just find them.

36:06.145 --> 36:09.674
Professor Mendella is more like
a father to me than my own.

36:12.529 --> 36:14.529
Where is your mother?

36:16.629 --> 36:23.530
She died here ten years ago.
She went out one night to the pyramids.

36:24.530 --> 36:28.529
They found her body there
the next morning.

36:28.529 --> 36:34.104
The Police said she was robbed and
killed for her money and jewellery.

36:34.529 --> 36:36.929
You don't believe that?

36:39.528 --> 36:42.528
I don't know what to believe.

36:42.528 --> 36:47.529
My mother was a very
strong and intuitive woman.

36:49.529 --> 36:52.025
She might have driven out alone
but it just seems unlikely

36:52.029 --> 36:55.728
that she get herself in a situation
where she'd be mugged.

36:58.429 --> 37:01.528
I sense you are very much like her.

37:02.528 --> 37:05.329
Thank you for saying so.

37:05.429 --> 37:10.029
Well I am sorry, Sarah.
If there is anything that I can do.

37:11.529 --> 37:14.528
You have by listening to me.

37:17.528 --> 37:23.529
Don't worry about me, okay?
- Okay.

37:41.527 --> 37:44.529
Be careful with that.

37:57.328 --> 37:58.420
That is unacceptable.

38:00.146 --> 38:05.528
Two soldiers, and Major and
myself go with you.  Agree?

38:05.528 --> 38:07.862
Agreed.

38:07.763 --> 38:08.930
What does it say?

38:08.965 --> 38:12.949
No one may enter this
tomb and return alive.

38:13.528 --> 38:17.627
Only the ones chosen by
the Gods who will endure.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.607
He's right.
That's what it says.

38:30.723 --> 38:32.833
Nothing like a good curse.

39:19.527 --> 39:21.527
Break it down.

39:26.527 --> 39:29.528
Why are letting them
destroy the hieroglyphics.

39:31.527 --> 39:35.227
Are you done?
Seal it!

39:35.527 --> 39:38.526
Because they sealed the entrance,
and it's the only way in.

39:44.526 --> 39:46.527
This is enough.

40:31.527 --> 40:33.526
Hornets.

40:41.626 --> 40:44.772
Just look.
We can't get through.

40:51.278 --> 40:53.435
Alright everyone, move back

40:54.526 --> 40:56.526
Calmly.

41:11.526 --> 41:13.525
Sarah...

41:14.526 --> 41:17.526
- Try not to move.
- I can't move.

41:59.525 --> 42:01.525
Oh, my God!

42:28.525 --> 42:30.525
We have to help him!

42:34.525 --> 42:37.525
It's too late.

42:41.525 --> 42:44.524
Way clear !

42:49.525 --> 42:52.525
Well done.

42:53.525 --> 42:55.525
Move !

42:56.277 --> 42:57.226
Careful !

42:57.824 --> 42:59.625
I thought we'd find traps
not bloody hornets nests.

42:59.626 --> 43:01.226
It is traps.

43:01.525 --> 43:05.823
- There's a tray of food in the chambers.
- I have a feeling we should go back.

43:06.524 --> 43:09.024
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Come on.

43:23.524 --> 43:26.424
This is the sort of area
where they like to set traps.

43:26.524 --> 43:29.521
- Will they work after all this time?
- Hardly likely.

43:29.625 --> 43:34.284
We found the skeletons of many tomb
robbers who go just like you, Mr Levitz.

43:36.525 --> 43:39.770
Criminals who
couldn't resist the gold.

43:39.771 --> 43:40.978
Levitz, stop!

43:44.076 --> 43:45.577
Levitz!

43:48.525 --> 43:51.524
Nobody move.

43:52.524 --> 43:55.965
Everybody, stay exactly
where you are.

43:56.265 --> 43:58.430
Everybody stand
perfectly still.

43:59.524 --> 44:04.523
Mr Levitz,
put the statue back.

44:20.423 --> 44:26.523
Everyone, remain where you are.
The room is unfortunately now armed.

44:30.524 --> 44:33.424
Mr Singh, would you
cast your eyes up ahead.

44:33.524 --> 44:36.524
Those tiles down there, I'm sure
they have some surprises in store for us.

44:36.824 --> 44:40.623
- Try and see if there is a sequence.
- We have to get out of here.

44:40.723 --> 44:42.823
And how would you say we do that?

44:42.824 --> 44:45.524
Other than by going ahead
and following the prescribed path!

44:45.623 --> 44:48.924
- What do you mean?
- We are sealed in.

44:51.424 --> 44:53.524
There must be a way out.
We just have to find it.

44:53.525 --> 44:56.425
Our mission is to find the tomb.

44:56.524 --> 45:02.323
And whatever lies beyond it.
Now take heart, everybody.

45:02.523 --> 45:08.523
We can still do this.
Claire knows, don't you Clair ?

45:10.324 --> 45:13.523
- We have no alternative but to go on...
- I think I have it.

45:14.523 --> 45:17.923
Provided that our friends
believed in symmetry.

45:18.523 --> 45:21.023
Two to the left.

45:29.323 --> 45:30.924
Stop!

45:31.424 --> 45:35.623
Take your weight off the tile.

45:37.523 --> 45:39.523
Take a bag.

45:54.522 --> 45:59.423
- Rohit, the secret is at the tiles.
- Yes

45:59.523 --> 46:03.222
You assumed the zero ten based ?
- Right !

46:03.522 --> 46:06.579
Well, wasn't the concept of
zero invented much later.

46:06.879 --> 46:08.623
Good point

46:09.822 --> 46:11.323
One up ...

46:12.523 --> 46:17.522
Two right. One forward,
two right.

46:18.423 --> 46:21.023
One forward, two right.

46:28.521 --> 46:32.385
- Well done, Mr Rohit.
- Thank you. Be careful.

46:32.523 --> 46:36.291
- Lead on.
- It's one forward, two right.

46:37.392 --> 46:40.492
One forward, two right.

46:40.622 --> 46:47.622
One forward, two right.  Careful,
slow.  One forward, two right.

46:56.522 --> 46:58.022
Thank you.

47:06.522 --> 47:10.522
Another dead end.

47:11.522 --> 47:13.822
There's another smaller shaft here.

47:13.823 --> 47:16.123
It's useless if it is sealed
from the other side.

47:16.222 --> 47:21.422
- Dr. Adler. I need your expertise.
- He doesn't know anything.

47:21.522 --> 47:24.021
What if he gets it wrong,
we're all dead.

47:24.022 --> 47:27.022
Shut up, Levitz.
Anyone knows nothing, it's you.

47:27.121 --> 47:30.722
- I'll take the shaft.
- I'm going with him.

47:33.622 --> 47:37.521
Go back the way we came.
See if we missed anything.

47:48.521 --> 47:52.822
These symbols, this place...

47:53.722 --> 47:56.621
- You ever had..?
- Deja vu.

47:57.321 --> 48:02.421
Remember it daily,
hide inside since I was a child.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.821
Something wanted you here ?

48:09.022 --> 48:12.322
Yeah, why don't you ask your
guys what it is, won't you ?

48:12.521 --> 48:14.722
I'd sure as hell
would like to know.

48:33.521 --> 48:37.121
What do you know about
Masterton and my mom?

48:38.520 --> 48:42.821
- We all have skeletons in our closet.
- Meaning what, exactly ?

48:43.421 --> 48:47.820
Wherever we're headed down here.
Nothing was gonna deter his plan.

48:47.920 --> 48:52.021
And no one is gonna stop him
achieving it.  Whatever the cost.

48:54.321 --> 48:57.621
- What do you mean ?
- I can't say anything more than that.

49:17.921 --> 49:22.520
This is strange - it's a man.
Maybe craft.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.620
Too many coincidence to have
occurred not to take it seriously.

49:27.520 --> 49:33.320
Here is a classic example.  Look at
the way a man has been portrayed.

49:33.520 --> 49:36.119
Egyptians mummified
their Gods and Pharaohs

49:36.120 --> 49:39.720
believing that they had
the secret of eternal life.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.220
Hmm, so requiring the
mummification process.

49:45.720 --> 49:49.420
They didn't sow it.
It was brought to them.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.421
Look.

49:52.621 --> 49:54.820
It's a machine of some kind.

49:54.920 --> 50:01.420
I've seen exactly the same in Peru and
Mexico.  Even in India we have the same.

50:01.520 --> 50:04.820
Now you tell me,
how they got there?

50:05.220 --> 50:07.919
The sleeper shall awaken.

50:11.519 --> 50:16.520
The sleeper shall awaken.
The earth will tremble at his feet.

50:18.520 --> 50:22.219
- Claire?
- Swimmer in the blood of men.

50:23.319 --> 50:28.519
The sign of Osiris risen.
The sign of Osiris dead.

50:28.719 --> 50:33.520
And the way shall be opened to
the true rulers of the true Gods.

50:34.519 --> 50:35.702
What have you found ?

50:36.521 --> 50:38.021
My guess is that,
there's a door here

50:38.120 --> 50:41.918
My guess is ... My guess is
you're fucking with our lives!

50:43.419 --> 50:45.119
Give me a hand.

51:03.819 --> 51:07.519
Ladies and gentlemen...
We are in business.

51:07.819 --> 51:11.819
- Well done, Doc.
- Well done.

51:16.519 --> 51:22.319
I used to wonder whether any ancient
Egyptian was over 5 ft 2 height.

51:22.519 --> 51:24.419
Just step here.

52:12.318 --> 52:14.119
So beautiful !

52:33.218 --> 52:34.719
Princess Amanphur.

52:35.219 --> 52:38.518
Masterton claims that my mother
was the direct bloodline of Osiris.

52:38.518 --> 52:40.245
She was.

52:41.444 --> 52:44.316
The puzzle is revealing its secrets.

52:47.418 --> 52:49.564
Let's take this off.

52:59.502 --> 53:01.633
Lift up the coffin.
Let's get rid of that.

53:10.711 --> 53:14.818
Princess Amanphur,
Men have not seen her face

53:15.079 --> 53:16.998
for 5000 years.

53:17.099 --> 53:19.603
Princess Amanphur...

53:20.655 --> 53:23.128
was a Pharaoh's whore !

53:25.618 --> 53:31.718
Buried out here was a red herring to
conceal the true nature of the place.

53:32.018 --> 53:37.418
- But the tomb, is history !
- History is written by kings.

53:37.518 --> 53:40.752
- And by Gods.
- Mr Levitz.

53:41.818 --> 53:44.656
The time has come.
The key !

53:56.446 --> 53:58.118
The Key of Heaven.

53:58.519 --> 53:59.953
The key?

54:02.417 --> 54:06.718
For Mendella this
was the Holy Grail.

54:07.517 --> 54:11.817
We both knew it existed.
Some scholars said it was just a myth.

54:11.917 --> 54:15.317
Hitler searched for this.

54:17.517 --> 54:21.517
It was destined to come to my hands.

54:46.517 --> 54:50.316
We are not here for
mere gold or trinkets.

54:51.416 --> 54:58.099
The real treasure lies hidden
deep below this glittering facade.

55:28.417 --> 55:31.216
- Are you alright ?
- Yeah.

55:33.316 --> 55:34.712
There is something down here.

55:34.813 --> 55:38.342
He needs you to find
whatever that is.

55:38.516 --> 55:41.459
You need to be careful.

55:41.517 --> 55:44.516
- Okay ?
- Okay.

55:53.516 --> 55:56.515
This place is like a labyrinth.

55:57.716 --> 56:01.216
Precision of language, Adam,
not "like a labyrinth".

56:01.217 --> 56:04.415
- It is a labyrinth.
- A labyrinth of traps.

56:04.416 --> 56:06.416
Yeah, but the treasure.
Do you know where it is located?

56:06.716 --> 56:09.104
I believe that we will
find the treasure in the

56:09.117 --> 56:11.515
deepest and most dangerous
part of the labyrinth.

56:11.615 --> 56:14.303
A treasure lost for
more than 5,000 years.

56:14.316 --> 56:16.716
The lost temple
of Osiris.

56:16.816 --> 56:21.516
- Like a myth.
- I don't like the look of this.

56:21.616 --> 56:25.415
I'll go first, you'll follow.
You, Levitz, will be last.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.916
You've done enough damage today.

56:29.516 --> 56:32.515
Now, very carefully.

56:51.515 --> 56:55.115
Masterton!
Stop treating me like a fool !

56:55.515 --> 56:57.116
Levitz!

57:03.316 --> 57:06.415
Now what !
We're sealed in.

57:06.815 --> 57:10.415
- Doug! Can you hear us?
- Oh, my God!

57:10.515 --> 57:14.915
Everyone else I need.
You are dispensable!

57:15.015 --> 57:16.986
Calm down,
we'll find a way.

57:17.187 --> 57:18.631
What are we looking for?

57:18.866 --> 57:22.415
Symbols, hieroglyphs. Something
to lead us to the inner shaft.

57:22.615 --> 57:25.315
There's no going back.

57:30.415 --> 57:33.514
We'll back track.
Find another way.

57:35.814 --> 57:39.515
Here.  Keep coming.

57:40.415 --> 57:45.015
Here, hold this.
The slaves often built escape routes.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.243
Masterton.

58:08.514 --> 58:11.215
We need to keep going down.

59:02.014 --> 59:06.366
- What happened ?
- He fell down, broke his neck.

59:06.367 --> 59:07.367
Oh no!

59:08.913 --> 59:13.514
- Shall we go back up ?
- We don't know what made him fall.

59:15.813 --> 59:17.613
What is it ?

59:18.813 --> 59:20.614
Who's there?

59:24.414 --> 59:27.814
- Get a grip.
- I have to find the way.

59:30.813 --> 59:32.614
Come on.

59:34.714 --> 59:36.513
Slowly.

59:39.714 --> 59:43.613
- Grab on to the handles.
- Come on.

59:45.514 --> 59:47.214
- Careful.
- Don't worry.

59:49.513 --> 59:52.613
Like sort of an elevator.

59:54.413 --> 59:56.313
- You alright ?
- Yeah.

01:00:17.812 --> 01:00:21.414
- Doug !
- What is it ?

01:00:24.013 --> 01:00:26.513
The soldier...

01:00:43.114 --> 01:00:46.413
Now listen to me, Levitz,
you corrupt and evil little man.

01:00:46.613 --> 01:00:51.412
One of the big mysteries of history
is how Egyptian civilization began.

01:00:51.612 --> 01:00:54.512
How it sprang up fully clothed
on the banks of the Nile.

01:00:54.712 --> 01:00:58.312
Well perhaps its
origin were elsewhere.

01:00:58.512 --> 01:01:02.313
The answer to that is
the treasure that we seek.

01:01:14.912 --> 01:01:17.211
I don't like it here.

01:01:18.511 --> 01:01:20.113
The "sleepers shall awaken".

01:01:21.713 --> 01:01:24.609
- What ?
- Somewhere in the blood of man.

01:01:25.209 --> 01:01:27.222
- What's the deal ?
- I don't know.

01:01:27.223 --> 01:01:30.655
Well he is an expert in antiquities.
Levitz has his key.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:32.915
Adam kisses ass.

01:01:33.763 --> 01:01:35.277
What about you ?

01:01:40.315 --> 01:01:41.412
I'm just a channel ...

01:01:41.612 --> 01:01:48.512
I channel messages from out there.

01:01:49.712 --> 01:01:52.811
Something's wrong !
Something is really wrong !

01:02:00.511 --> 01:02:04.510
- Doug, it's you?
- What the hell are you doing?

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:08.512
I'm sorry.  I'm spooked.
There's something after us.

01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:12.012
We found a soldier.
He fell.

01:02:18.512 --> 01:02:23.012
You're still alive.
This way.

01:03:06.512 --> 01:03:10.111
So many dead...
Blinded by the light.

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:14.212
- What did they see?
- Victims of the Sun.

01:03:16.511 --> 01:03:19.511
They are not human.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:45.210
Oh my God !

01:03:46.911 --> 01:03:49.010
- What's up ?
- I heard something.

01:04:00.810 --> 01:04:03.111
- What the fuck is that ?
- A rat.

01:04:03.511 --> 01:04:06.111
Mr Levitz, do try
not to be hysterical.

01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:08.410
Just a rat.

01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:26.511
Look at you.  Like a bunch of
scared schoolboys in a graveyard.

01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:29.111
A little nervousness
is hardly surprising.

01:04:29.511 --> 01:04:32.296
Some of our party
are dead, Levitz.

01:04:32.932 --> 01:04:34.706
Must be because of you.

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:39.010
Because you're jinxed.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:04.110
She's getting attacked.

01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:11.009
What is it ?

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:17.409
What the hell is it ?

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:48.605
I need you to find an exit.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:53.209
No ..shh... I need to find the others.
You'll be okay.  Go!

01:06:27.409 --> 01:06:30.909
It's you !
Follow me !

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:41.908
Over here.
I found the door !

01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:46.509
Come on!

01:06:49.409 --> 01:06:51.509
No !  No !

01:07:14.508 --> 01:07:16.508
Come on!

01:07:52.608 --> 01:07:54.207
Sahid is dead.

01:07:57.408 --> 01:07:59.008
Fascinating.

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:06.008
Fascinating?  Sahid just got killed, and
you wanted Levitz to die... didn't you ?

01:08:06.808 --> 01:08:08.608
You're not listening to me !

01:08:10.508 --> 01:08:12.608
- Bastard !
- Now you listen to me !

01:08:12.609 --> 01:08:14.409
You and your precious Levitz.

01:08:14.708 --> 01:08:17.207
How the hell do you think
he got the Key of Heaven.

01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:20.408
He killed Khalfani.
He murdered him!

01:08:20.508 --> 01:08:21.608
The Police got the murder weapon.

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:25.709
Your sword stick with
your fingerprints all over it!

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:30.808
What was that thing over there?

01:08:31.508 --> 01:08:32.529
What was it?

01:08:32.634 --> 01:08:33.973
That thing ....

01:08:34.372 --> 01:08:38.236
Some of the ancient text
allude to a guardian who

01:08:38.249 --> 01:08:42.122
was hidden in the pyramid
by the followers of Ra.

01:08:42.124 --> 01:08:44.924
It was designed to be triggered
whenever an intruder entered the tomb.

01:08:45.358 --> 01:08:49.508
But that will not stop me!

01:08:50.506 --> 01:08:57.008
- It will not stop me !
- He'll kill it like you killed my mother?

01:09:15.307 --> 01:09:16.305
Look.

01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:22.107
Look!

01:09:29.107 --> 01:09:30.907
It's not from here.

01:09:33.506 --> 01:09:37.207
And all those years my theory
has been rejected and laughed at.

01:09:38.106 --> 01:09:39.106
Look!

01:09:42.506 --> 01:09:45.399
Doug. Find me a way in.

01:09:47.407 --> 01:09:50.006
It's your only chance of
getting Sarah out of here.

01:10:00.706 --> 01:10:03.106
Do not look for the obvious.

01:10:05.706 --> 01:10:08.707
This inscription... Osiris.

01:10:08.807 --> 01:10:12.203
Sign of Osiris risen.
The sign of Osiris dead.

01:10:12.606 --> 01:10:17.107
Right. The oldest form of the name was
written by mean of two hieroglyphics.

01:10:19.706 --> 01:10:23.706
One which represents the
throne and the other the eye.

01:10:23.906 --> 01:10:27.800
The way shall be opened
and the brow of the God

01:10:27.806 --> 01:10:29.205
the great bird, Sothis.

01:10:29.207 --> 01:10:33.406
Sothis, was sometimes
called Sirius, the dog star.

01:10:33.506 --> 01:10:38.805
Sirius was the pole star seen on
the sky when the pyramids were built.

01:10:41.406 --> 01:10:43.506
That's it.

01:10:49.906 --> 01:10:51.607
Doug, hurry, please.

01:11:02.505 --> 01:11:06.340
Sarah! Walk through the membrane.
You are the key!

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:43.805
Hurry !

01:11:45.105 --> 01:11:47.505
Run right through the door!
Come on.

01:12:52.105 --> 01:12:53.405
Adam!

01:12:56.504 --> 01:12:59.905
This is some kind of ancient
power generator here.

01:13:01.903 --> 01:13:02.803
Hey!

01:13:04.504 --> 01:13:07.200
Back up, cowboy.
We don't need you anymore.

01:13:07.204 --> 01:13:09.005
No, damn it. Damn it.

01:13:10.704 --> 01:13:12.105
What are you doing?

01:13:15.205 --> 01:13:18.204
The genetic signature
of the princess Amanphur

01:13:18.205 --> 01:13:22.205
is preserved intact only
in the direct female bloodline.

01:13:22.504 --> 01:13:26.704
You are a directly descended
from Princess Amanphur.

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:31.504
- We need your blood
- Let her go !

01:13:41.304 --> 01:13:45.103
I'm okay.
I'm alright.

01:13:49.405 --> 01:13:50.804
Rohit...

01:14:03.504 --> 01:14:08.500
If your mother had cooperated,
she would have been here

01:14:08.503 --> 01:14:11.304
to witnessed the resurrection.

01:14:11.504 --> 01:14:13.404
If she had cooperated ?

01:14:13.405 --> 01:14:15.605
She would have sat
beside me upon this throne

01:14:15.704 --> 01:14:20.503
to inaugurate a new era of
human history.  But she refused me.

01:14:23.504 --> 01:14:28.603
Let the sleepless awake.

01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:26.303
Our knowledge of this has come down
to me through countless generations.

01:15:27.402 --> 01:15:31.603
- For me you're going to stop this.
- No, Rohit. Come on.

01:15:32.204 --> 01:15:34.303
We welcome them back...

01:15:34.403 --> 01:15:36.603
Come on, stay with me.

01:15:39.503 --> 01:15:43.402
and made us in their image.

01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:51.003
At last, mankind will
receive its full potential !

01:16:33.503 --> 01:16:36.102
Behold the Sun!

01:16:39.502 --> 01:16:45.502
Your blood unites us all.
Too late! Too late.

01:17:34.402 --> 01:17:36.301
Give me.

01:17:43.702 --> 01:17:45.401
We need to go!

01:18:39.501 --> 01:18:42.501
Oh, my God!

01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:19.501
It is here.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.300
You were pretty
brave back there.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:26.800
You saved my life, thank you.

01:19:28.747 --> 01:19:30.465
No, thank you

01:19:40.201 --> 01:19:42.500
They're out there

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.500
waiting to return.
