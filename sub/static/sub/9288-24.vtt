00:12.736 --> 00:14.033
Right now...

00:14.137 --> 00:17.504
...terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:18.008 --> 00:20.875
My wife and daughter have been targeted...

00:20.977 --> 00:24.504
...and people that I work with
may be involved in both.

00:25.082 --> 00:27.312
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer...

00:27.417 --> 00:31.114
...and today is the longest day of my life.

01:47.998 --> 01:49.830
We will.

01:51.433 --> 01:53.129
Maybe you're right.

01:53.570 --> 01:54.902
Maybe she drowned.

01:55.006 --> 01:56.699
It does not matter...

01:56.805 --> 01:59.673
...as long as Bauer believes
his daughter is here.

02:37.779 --> 02:39.040
Stop! Stop, please!

02:40.681 --> 02:43.207
At this time,
we do not have any information...

02:43.316 --> 02:46.947
...as to the cause of the explosion
that killed Senator David Palmer.

02:59.089 --> 03:01.684
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

03:01.792 --> 03:03.782
Since no one has seen a body...

03:03.893 --> 03:06.294
...the media is circulating
all kinds of rumors.

03:06.397 --> 03:09.058
I will tell them
as soon as I have confirmation...

03:09.165 --> 03:11.031
...that Jack Bauer's daughter is safe.

03:11.502 --> 03:12.694
And then what, David?

03:12.801 --> 03:13.962
You're going to play dead...

03:14.370 --> 03:17.270
...and I'm supposed to hide here
and play the grieving widow?

03:17.773 --> 03:20.937
Just how long do you think
we can keep that charade up?

03:21.044 --> 03:23.511
For as long as we have to.
That's crazy!

03:23.612 --> 03:27.207
Mike, tell him how crazy it is.
He listens to you.

03:27.316 --> 03:28.715
Don't put me in the middle.

03:28.817 --> 03:31.048
What, isn't that your job,
to be in the middle?

03:31.154 --> 03:34.851
For crying out loud, Mike.
It's your career on the line, too.

03:37.191 --> 03:39.683
You came clean on TV today.

03:40.196 --> 03:41.491
You got lucky.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.725
But it could just as easily
have gone the other way.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.096
Testing the public's patience
like that?

03:47.335 --> 03:49.270
You won't be lucky again, David.

03:49.371 --> 03:50.802
Listen to me.

03:52.206 --> 03:53.868
Jack Bauer saved my life today.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.006
Not once, but twice.

03:57.111 --> 04:00.910
I realize that
and I am sympathetic to what he...

04:01.014 --> 04:03.540
- I don't think you are!
- I am. Listen to me...

04:03.651 --> 04:07.142
No! I am going to respect his request
and so are you.

04:07.855 --> 04:10.414
You will not sacrifice his daughter.

04:31.645 --> 04:34.909
- Anything new?
- I'm just going over the intel from Langley.

04:35.014 --> 04:36.106
I mean about Jack.

04:36.215 --> 04:37.205
CTU, Almeida.

04:37.317 --> 04:39.613
I assume you still haven't heard
anything from him.

04:40.019 --> 04:41.145
Not yet.

04:41.253 --> 04:42.516
George.

04:42.823 --> 04:44.413
I've got Highway Patrol on Line 7.

04:44.522 --> 04:47.492
They picked up a girl at the port,
says she's Jack's daughter.

04:47.593 --> 04:49.184
Patch it through.

04:53.030 --> 04:55.727
This is George Mason, CTU.
Who am I speaking with?

04:55.834 --> 04:57.632
Sergeant Devlin, Highway Patrol.

04:57.736 --> 04:59.498
I hear you have a young woman with you.

04:59.604 --> 05:01.436
Claims she's the daughter of your agent.

05:01.707 --> 05:03.468
- Jack Bauer?
- That's right.

05:03.574 --> 05:05.236
Can I speak with her, please?

05:08.579 --> 05:09.569
Hello?

05:09.681 --> 05:13.047
Kim, this is George Mason at CTU.
How are you? Okay?

05:13.150 --> 05:17.381
Yes. Tell my father that I've escaped
or he'll go there and they'll kill him.

05:17.487 --> 05:19.785
Can you tell us
where these people are, Kim?

05:19.890 --> 05:22.221
The port. I don't know exactly.

05:22.325 --> 05:24.487
- May I speak with the Sergeant?
- Okay.

05:26.331 --> 05:28.194
We picked her up near Dock 11 Alpha.

05:28.732 --> 05:31.031
Send two tactical teams. Highest priority.

05:31.135 --> 05:33.192
Have law enforcement
establish a perimeter.

05:33.302 --> 05:34.634
Where are you now, Sergeant?

05:34.738 --> 05:36.137
North of the harbor.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.833
All right, get Kim over here ASAP,
all right?

05:39.309 --> 05:42.038
We've got to find Jack
before he walks into a trap.

05:42.144 --> 05:43.577
We need to coordinate two...

07:04.642 --> 07:05.701
Yes.

07:05.811 --> 07:07.540
What's taking so long?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.010
I just got here.

07:09.113 --> 07:10.512
Where exactly?

07:10.848 --> 07:12.542
Don't worry. I'm close enough.

07:12.649 --> 07:13.616
Where's my daughter?

07:13.751 --> 07:16.185
- She's right here.
- Put her on the phone.

07:16.488 --> 07:19.183
Come to the parking lot of the
freight office.

07:19.557 --> 07:20.854
I'll come out with her.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.653
Let me speak to her first.

07:22.759 --> 07:24.192
There's been enough talking.

07:24.294 --> 07:26.955
After what's happened today,
you expect me to trust you?

07:27.063 --> 07:28.895
We know you lied
about Palmer being dead...

07:28.999 --> 07:31.093
...so don't talk about trust, all right?

07:31.302 --> 07:34.464
Just get down here now
or I'll kill her myself. Trust that.

07:35.272 --> 07:38.400
I'm not going to show myself
until I speak to my daughter first.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.103
Don't test me.

07:42.278 --> 07:43.576
Bauer!

07:46.582 --> 07:48.709
He's not coming.

07:50.153 --> 07:51.516
He's coming.

07:58.794 --> 08:01.159
Nina, what's the ETA on the TAC teams?

08:01.463 --> 08:04.126
Five on the Alpha,
eight on the Beta.

08:09.672 --> 08:10.660
Myers.

08:10.772 --> 08:12.364
Nina, it's me.

08:12.474 --> 08:13.908
Where are you?

08:14.010 --> 08:15.600
Listen carefully.

08:15.709 --> 08:19.736
I've just confirmed that someone at CTU
is feeding the Drazens information.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.543
Based on what?

08:21.649 --> 08:23.514
They know that Palmer wasn't killed.

08:23.618 --> 08:26.142
Who at CTU had clearance
for that kind of intel?

08:26.487 --> 08:29.581
Besides me, just Tony,
Mason and Chappelle.

08:29.690 --> 08:31.385
One of those three is working for them.

08:31.492 --> 08:32.857
You need to find out which one.

08:33.660 --> 08:36.652
Okay. But Jack, what are you doing?
Where are you?

08:36.764 --> 08:39.493
Andre agreed to a trade, me for Kim.

08:41.001 --> 08:43.027
Are you just
going to walk right up to them?

08:43.138 --> 08:45.001
If I can guarantee Kim's safety, yes.

08:45.605 --> 08:49.097
Nina, there's a chance that I won't be able
to see this thing through.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.575
Until you know who's giving the
Drazens information...

08:51.678 --> 08:54.077
...don't trust anyone. I've got to go.

09:22.662 --> 09:26.064
I don't think the situation will
require much spin...

09:26.200 --> 09:28.826
...as long as you do what you've been
doing all along.

09:29.469 --> 09:33.234
- Tell me again what I've been doing, Mike?
- Telling the truth.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.138
And tearing my family apart in the process.

09:41.315 --> 09:43.544
As hard as it's been for everyone...

09:43.983 --> 09:48.113
...I think this last day has been about
finding out who you really are...

09:49.255 --> 09:51.620
...not just as a candidate.

09:57.596 --> 09:58.585
Yeah.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.097
Mike, turn on the TV.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.427
What is it, Mike?

10:06.871 --> 10:09.966
A reliable source from inside
Palmer's campaign...

10:10.076 --> 10:14.535
...confirmed just moments ago
the Senator was unharmed by the blast.

10:15.245 --> 10:16.303
Damn it!

10:16.413 --> 10:21.009
What is still uncertain is
why the Senator has not made a statement.

10:21.552 --> 10:22.678
Sherry.

10:23.355 --> 10:24.379
David.

10:24.522 --> 10:27.149
We have to deal with the press, David.

10:27.725 --> 10:28.852
David!

10:30.360 --> 10:33.091
You couldn't wait to leak it
to the press, could you?

10:33.197 --> 10:35.164
- David, I...
- It was you!

10:35.365 --> 10:38.392
What were you thinking?
They already knew.

10:38.502 --> 10:40.935
Damn it, Sherry!
The way you keep defying me!

10:41.070 --> 10:43.505
I'm not defying you,
I am protecting you!

10:43.607 --> 10:44.698
Protecting me from what?

10:44.807 --> 10:47.504
- Mike!
- Back off, David. I mean it.

10:47.611 --> 10:49.076
- Get off me.
- I mean it!

10:49.177 --> 10:50.167
Get off me!

10:50.279 --> 10:51.837
Back off! David!

10:51.948 --> 10:54.438
You have to talk to the press, now.

10:55.150 --> 10:59.018
The longer you take to make a statement,
the more control you give up.

10:59.121 --> 11:02.057
Damn it! If that child dies!

11:36.425 --> 11:38.152
- Yes?
- It's me.

11:38.258 --> 11:39.749
I'm busy. What's happening?

11:39.860 --> 11:42.453
They found his daughter.
She'll be here within the hour.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.455
- Does Bauer know?
- No. Not yet.

11:47.567 --> 11:49.228
I'm the only one in contact with him.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.763
I've been ordered by CTU
to send in two teams.

11:52.071 --> 11:55.099
- They're on their way.
- All right, hold on.

11:55.209 --> 11:57.402
They found the girl.
Bauer doesn't know.

11:57.509 --> 12:01.536
The CTU people are already on their way.
We have to get you out of here.

12:01.914 --> 12:05.146
He won't come if we can't
produce the girl. He's not stupid.

12:06.085 --> 12:08.953
Father, we barely have time to get
to international waters.

12:09.055 --> 12:10.987
I can't risk you getting captured again.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.317
Give me the phone.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.526
Can you contact Bauer?

12:19.199 --> 12:20.221
Yes.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.701
You tell him his daughter is dead.

12:24.969 --> 12:27.632
Her body was found floating in the harbor.

12:27.773 --> 12:30.002
- You think he'll come after you?
- Yes.

12:31.509 --> 12:34.104
You'll have to kill him. No mistakes.

12:34.279 --> 12:37.179
If he finds out I've lied to him,
my cover will be blown.

12:37.281 --> 12:40.249
Of course we will kill him.
That is the point.

12:43.087 --> 12:44.451
He's coming.

12:49.159 --> 12:50.251
Andre?

12:50.360 --> 12:51.726
No. It's me.

12:51.863 --> 12:54.660
- Come back to CTU.
- I can't. I'm running out of time.

12:54.765 --> 12:56.027
I'm going to get Kim now.

12:57.101 --> 13:00.558
I don't know how to tell you this.
What is it, Nina?

13:03.405 --> 13:06.341
Coast Guard Cutter answered the APB
we put out on Kim.

13:07.144 --> 13:09.134
- They found her body, Jack.
- What?

13:09.311 --> 13:10.403
I'm sorry.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.412
She's dead.

13:13.249 --> 13:14.238
No.

13:14.350 --> 13:17.252
I'm so sorry. Jack?

15:04.455 --> 15:06.286
What if Bauer doesn't come?

15:06.390 --> 15:09.256
He may be too crushed by
the thought of his daughter's death.

15:09.359 --> 15:11.760
That is exactly why he will come.

15:12.430 --> 15:14.692
Believe me. I know.

15:37.252 --> 15:40.745
Go! Hurry, Father, get to the boat.

18:38.919 --> 18:43.822
It has come to my attention
that misinformation was given to the press.

18:43.924 --> 18:48.053
And again, I apologize
for the misunderstanding.

18:48.929 --> 18:51.795
As you can imagine,
this has been a very chaotic situation.

18:52.765 --> 18:57.099
But I appreciate the confidence the voters
have continued to show for our campaign.

18:58.869 --> 19:03.171
We regret that false information
has been broadcast regarding this incident.

19:03.275 --> 19:04.764
But, thankfully, no one was hurt.

19:06.244 --> 19:09.440
My family and I are safe,
and we have no intention...

19:09.546 --> 19:11.981
...of letting this slow us down in any way.

19:16.154 --> 19:18.178
Are you coming here to lecture me, Mike?

19:18.689 --> 19:20.247
Lecture you on what?

19:20.357 --> 19:24.123
About how I'm not being
supportive enough for David.

19:24.361 --> 19:27.024
Actually, I'm on your side this time.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.359
I think David was hurting
himself with this charade.

19:32.735 --> 19:36.001
Maybe it's good you leaked
the truth to the press.

19:39.508 --> 19:44.241
I want to know what this entire day
has done to his campaign.

19:45.148 --> 19:48.378
I think we should run some focus groups
first thing in the morning.

19:48.484 --> 19:52.249
I've already called Robin over at ASI.
Okay, good.

19:52.454 --> 19:56.392
Do you think David should cancel
his trip to Dallas, go back to Washington?

19:56.493 --> 19:58.049
I don't know, Sherry.

19:59.862 --> 20:01.159
I think...

20:02.063 --> 20:03.496
...David should make that call.

20:03.598 --> 20:04.896
No, I don't.

20:05.001 --> 20:07.992
David's in no frame of mind to make
critical decisions right now.

20:08.103 --> 20:11.503
It's going to take you and I to steer
this thing by ourselves, okay...

20:11.605 --> 20:13.699
...until he gets his head screwed on right.

20:15.544 --> 20:17.134
Listen, Sherry...

20:17.812 --> 20:21.474
...David wanted to meet with you privately
when he finished his statement.

20:21.582 --> 20:24.347
David doesn't need
to make an appointment to see me.

20:24.452 --> 20:25.941
I'm right here.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.715
He'll be in the ballroom
in five minutes.

20:28.857 --> 20:31.950
I've already called the Secret Service.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.793
What's this all about?

20:35.895 --> 20:37.158
He didn't say.

20:37.765 --> 20:39.096
If I were you...

20:40.566 --> 20:42.660
...I'd take it as an opportunity...

20:43.103 --> 20:44.831
...to make the first move.

20:46.472 --> 20:48.031
Patch things up.

20:48.475 --> 20:50.203
Make things right.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.545
Fine, Mike.

21:07.026 --> 21:10.085
That's too much. Tony, get this.

21:10.195 --> 21:11.321
Okay, I'll call you back.

21:11.430 --> 21:14.524
The TAC team got there,
but Jack went in without them.

21:14.633 --> 21:16.157
- By himself?
- Evidently.

21:16.268 --> 21:18.032
Is he all right?
He's alive.

21:18.369 --> 21:21.271
- What about the Drazens?
- What are you talking about?

21:21.673 --> 21:22.732
Dead.

21:24.008 --> 21:26.204
Congratulations, Teri. Your family's fine.

21:26.311 --> 21:27.778
They're on their way over here now.

21:27.878 --> 21:30.871
Anyway, Karris counts seven down.
Jack's the last man standing.

21:32.649 --> 21:35.050
Want to contact Secret Service.
I'll update Division?

21:35.152 --> 21:37.144
I talked to Jack an hour ago.
He said...

21:37.255 --> 21:41.247
Teri, I told you everybody's fine.
Now go in there and celebrate. Relax.

22:31.939 --> 22:32.998
Nina?

22:45.085 --> 22:46.644
Can I help you?

23:20.286 --> 23:22.619
Call me when it's time.
Someone is there?

23:22.722 --> 23:24.621
- Yes.
- I understand.

23:24.990 --> 23:27.619
- You speak German?
- Frankfurt Division.

23:28.426 --> 23:30.952
- Something wrong?
- Yes.

23:31.063 --> 23:35.625
I just heard there was some big shoot-out.
No one will tell me what's going on.

23:36.001 --> 23:38.332
Teri, calm down. Jack and Kim are fine.

23:38.436 --> 23:40.769
They're on their way here right now.

23:41.473 --> 23:43.099
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

23:43.208 --> 23:45.403
What about the men
that were after Kim and me?

23:45.510 --> 23:49.310
They're dead. You and Kim are safe.
And so is Jack.

23:49.447 --> 23:50.436
Okay.

23:50.782 --> 23:53.545
I just want us all to be
back together again, I guess.

23:53.650 --> 23:55.175
It won't be long.

23:56.853 --> 23:57.877
Thank God.

23:59.939 --> 24:04.090
I'm sorry, I still have a lot of work to do.
So if there's nothing else...

24:04.679 --> 24:06.793
There is, actually. Um...

24:07.638 --> 24:10.028
This is a little awkward, Nina, but...

24:11.039 --> 24:13.677
It's my guess that you still
have feelings for Jack,

24:13.758 --> 24:17.193
and now that we're together again
and we're going to have a baby...

24:17.277 --> 24:22.988
Teri... As soon as this is over, I plan to have
myself tranferred out of this office.

24:24.318 --> 24:26.308
- Really?
- Yes.

24:27.377 --> 24:29.846
- Oh, Nina, I'm sorry...
- No need to apologise.

24:29.938 --> 24:32.770
If anything, I appreciate your being honest.

24:38.091 --> 24:39.217
This is Myers.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.089
You're still not alone?

24:41.193 --> 24:42.353
That's right.

24:42.462 --> 24:44.927
Listen carefully. Procedures are
in place.

24:44.935 --> 24:46.972
Collect all of your information.

24:47.032 --> 24:49.365
- We have arranged for your extraction.
- Where?

24:49.867 --> 24:52.530
The usual pickup point. Northwest corner.

24:53.640 --> 24:54.866
Is there anything else?

24:55.406 --> 24:58.570
That's all right, I know you're busy.
I'll let you get back to work.

25:06.351 --> 25:08.047
I can't let you go.

25:12.156 --> 25:13.351
Not yet.

25:14.758 --> 25:16.624
Move back into the room, slowly.

25:18.330 --> 25:20.023
I said move!

25:24.601 --> 25:28.060
Against the wall. On your knees.

25:28.505 --> 25:29.631
Do it!

25:42.086 --> 25:43.881
Officer!

25:45.756 --> 25:49.714
The body that you pulled out of the harbor.
That was my daughter.

25:50.160 --> 25:51.593
I'd like to claim the body.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.028
I'm not sure who you mean.

25:54.430 --> 25:58.196
The Coast Guard, they pulled a body
out of the harbor. In the last hour.

25:58.301 --> 26:00.496
I didn't hear anything,
but I just got on duty.

26:00.603 --> 26:02.570
If you'd like, I can call the harbor master.

26:03.204 --> 26:06.266
Hold on one second. Give me your phone.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.836
Could you call him now, please?

26:10.946 --> 26:12.435
Yes, sure.

26:14.015 --> 26:16.346
- Harbor Master's office.
- Frank.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.919
Did you guys pull a body
out of the harbor?

26:19.020 --> 26:20.648
No, nothing on our patrol.

26:20.890 --> 26:22.686
- You sure?
- No reports anywhere.

26:22.791 --> 26:24.156
All right, roger that.

26:24.259 --> 26:25.227
What'd he say?

26:25.328 --> 26:28.194
No body's been found
in the harbor or anywhere near it.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.161
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.929
Is it possible that another unit
picked her up?

26:33.033 --> 26:35.899
We cover 50 miles of coastline.
No body was found tonight.

26:38.439 --> 26:40.067
Thanks. Thank you.

27:11.671 --> 27:13.900
- This is Mason.
- It's Jack.

27:14.005 --> 27:17.100
I don't know whether to congratulate you
or demand you resign.

27:17.210 --> 27:18.835
Do you know where my daughter is?

27:18.943 --> 27:21.606
Yes, Highway Patrol
picked her up about half an hour ago.

27:21.713 --> 27:23.577
She's heading over here
under heavy escort.

27:23.681 --> 27:25.274
If you called, I could've told you.

27:25.384 --> 27:26.544
You need to arrest Nina.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.485
I what?

27:28.586 --> 27:31.579
She's working against us.
Don't let her out of the building.

27:31.690 --> 27:33.919
Jack, hold on a second.
What's all this about?

27:34.024 --> 27:36.550
She told me that they
found Kim's body in the harbor.

27:36.661 --> 27:39.356
I confirmed with the Coast Guard.
They never found a body.

27:39.463 --> 27:41.989
She was working with the Drazens
to set a trap for me.

27:42.467 --> 27:44.400
Are you sure
there wasn't a misunderstanding?

27:44.668 --> 27:46.864
- About Kim being dead?
- No, George. She lied.

27:46.972 --> 27:48.301
There was no misunderstanding.

27:48.405 --> 27:51.068
There's no proof either.
It's your word against hers.

27:51.175 --> 27:53.836
I'll get you your proof.
Don't let her out of your sight.

28:11.429 --> 28:12.655
Archives. Wilson.

28:12.761 --> 28:14.161
Paul. It's Jack.

28:14.264 --> 28:16.493
I need a copy of the morning
security tape...

28:16.598 --> 28:20.763
...between 8:50 and 9:00 am. in the ITS,
when Jamey committed suicide in there.

28:21.670 --> 28:23.331
All right, let me check.

28:28.944 --> 28:31.104
- That's weird.
- What, you got it?

28:31.245 --> 28:33.373
Yes, sir. Except the tape was erased.

28:33.949 --> 28:35.008
When?

28:35.452 --> 28:36.439
This morning.

28:36.551 --> 28:40.181
- What about the digital backup?
- There's no digital backup for ITS.

28:40.289 --> 28:44.487
There is. You just need
the proper clearance code. Try C-2-2-7-1-7.

28:46.127 --> 28:49.723
- How long is this going to take?
- Just a few minutes.

28:49.832 --> 28:52.061
Get back to me as soon as you can.

29:03.311 --> 29:05.141
Wait a moment, please.

29:21.328 --> 29:22.454
David.

29:26.131 --> 29:28.430
Mike said you wanted to see me.

29:28.666 --> 29:29.691
Yes.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.368
I know we need to talk, but...

29:37.711 --> 29:40.440
...honestly, David,
we haven't slept in two days.

29:40.546 --> 29:42.777
Can't it wait until the morning?

29:53.525 --> 29:55.356
We've had a rough day.

30:01.967 --> 30:05.129
And, yes, I know that you are
very angry with me.

30:09.172 --> 30:12.232
But when we've put this day
in perspective...

30:13.911 --> 30:17.745
...you'll realize that I've been acting
in your best interest all along.

30:19.182 --> 30:20.775
I'm not angry with you, Sherry.

30:22.084 --> 30:23.712
Good, David.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.751
I feel sorry for you.

30:31.494 --> 30:33.325
You feel sorry for me?

30:37.667 --> 30:40.533
You've lost touch with what it is to be...

30:42.572 --> 30:43.903
...a parent...

30:46.007 --> 30:47.338
...a friend...

30:50.046 --> 30:51.205
...a wife.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.474
What?

31:03.693 --> 31:05.249
After tonight...

31:07.062 --> 31:09.258
...I don't want to see you again.

31:11.632 --> 31:15.864
- David, will you just...
- Please. I've heard it all before.

31:20.774 --> 31:24.709
And I don't care what this may do
to my candidacy.

31:24.811 --> 31:27.042
And it's not because
I don't want to be President.

31:28.249 --> 31:29.305
I do.

31:34.053 --> 31:37.546
I just don't think you're fit to be
the First Lady.

31:48.934 --> 31:52.372
Do you really think that
you can just leave me?

31:56.643 --> 31:59.611
Don't believe for a second
that it's going to be that easy.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.713
Secret Service will take you back
to Washington whenever you're ready.

32:09.788 --> 32:10.982
David.

32:12.356 --> 32:15.155
You just don't walk away from me!

32:18.863 --> 32:21.660
You can't do this without me!

32:22.767 --> 32:25.293
I'm talking to you!

32:25.437 --> 32:28.564
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Get your hands off of me.

33:03.973 --> 33:06.668
- Yes?
- Jack, it's Paul Wilson.

33:06.775 --> 33:08.869
I got the Jamey
interrogation footage for you.

33:08.978 --> 33:10.500
Good, I've got a monitor in my car.

33:10.646 --> 33:12.580
Send it to me so I can take a look at it.

33:12.681 --> 33:14.274
Sure thing.

33:30.732 --> 33:32.564
Oh, my God.

33:33.135 --> 33:36.865
Send this over to Mason, his eyes only,
and patch me through to him.

33:38.638 --> 33:42.131
- Mason.
- George, are you in front of your screen?

33:42.243 --> 33:43.266
Yes. What is it?

33:43.376 --> 33:46.210
Proof against Nina.
She killed Jamey Farrell.

33:47.582 --> 33:50.482
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.

33:55.021 --> 33:56.580
This is unbelievable.

33:58.023 --> 34:01.187
- Where are you right now?
- I'm about five minutes out.

34:01.895 --> 34:03.486
Find her, George.

34:32.688 --> 34:35.215
- Where are you?
- I'm leaving now.

34:35.326 --> 34:37.815
You have 16 minutes to reach
the pickup point.

34:37.928 --> 34:40.123
We're routing you through Munich
for three days.

34:40.297 --> 34:42.764
Why Germany?
Why can't I come to you directly?

34:42.866 --> 34:45.460
I don't know.
These are the instructions.

34:46.002 --> 34:48.402
You need to be untraceable
during that time.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.530
Make sure nothing
can connect you to Germany.

34:53.275 --> 34:55.469
- Did you hear me?
- All right.

34:59.216 --> 35:01.045
I'm leaving now, Teri.

35:01.383 --> 35:04.286
I'm going to lock you in from the outside.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.380
Someone will find you soon.

35:08.090 --> 35:10.023
Everything will be fine.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.129
- Anything?
- Nothing.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.187
Ms. Myers!

36:56.226 --> 36:58.457
Put your hands where I can see them!

36:59.930 --> 37:02.397
Nina, put your hands on the steering wheel!

37:22.452 --> 37:23.612
Jack.

37:24.452 --> 37:27.582
If you kill me,
you won't know who I work for.

37:28.124 --> 37:31.559
You think I work for Drazen, but I don't.

37:33.797 --> 37:35.525
I trusted you, Nina.

37:37.566 --> 37:40.193
- I was just doing my job.
- Your job?

37:40.301 --> 37:42.930
My wife and daughter almost died today.

37:43.437 --> 37:46.271
How many people that
trusted you lost their life today...

37:46.375 --> 37:48.172
...because you were doing your job?

37:48.308 --> 37:49.503
Walsh?

37:49.777 --> 37:52.474
Jamey? Ellis? How many others?

37:52.581 --> 37:55.014
How many people died
because of you, Jack?

37:55.116 --> 37:58.209
Jack, take it easy.
We need her alive.

37:59.386 --> 38:02.551
Come on, Jack. Kim just got here.

38:02.658 --> 38:05.558
They're taking her inside right now.
Come on.

38:05.660 --> 38:07.649
Jack, don't do it.

38:10.297 --> 38:13.026
Come on, Jack.
Come be with your family.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.328
Come on, let's go.

38:18.237 --> 38:19.671
Let's go inside.

38:19.873 --> 38:22.170
This is no good. Come on, Jack.

38:34.620 --> 38:37.110
Good job. Come on, now.

38:39.024 --> 38:41.990
It's okay. You all right?

38:42.527 --> 38:43.995
Vehicle's clear.

38:44.597 --> 38:46.154
You did the right thing.

38:47.132 --> 38:49.158
You want to take her up?

38:50.569 --> 38:51.967
Come on.

38:57.075 --> 38:59.066
Come on, let's go.

39:20.129 --> 39:21.825
Sweetheart.
Dad!

39:21.999 --> 39:23.296
Thank God you're all right.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.835
- Sorry. Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right.

39:26.937 --> 39:28.461
- How about you?
- I'm fine.

39:28.572 --> 39:30.334
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

39:30.439 --> 39:32.533
- Sweetheart.
- I was so worried.

39:34.810 --> 39:36.038
It's all over, baby.

39:36.679 --> 39:39.374
No one's going to hurt you now, I promise.

39:40.249 --> 39:41.477
I love you so much.

39:42.151 --> 39:43.483
I love you.

39:46.789 --> 39:47.756
Where's Mom?

39:49.124 --> 39:51.650
I thought she was here with you.
I'll go find her.

39:52.094 --> 39:54.527
- Just stay here with the guards, okay?
- Okay.

39:54.629 --> 39:55.687
Okay.

39:56.999 --> 40:00.798
... while eluding two
assassination attempts, just hours apart.

40:00.902 --> 40:05.430
It may take days, even weeks,
before details become clear.

40:05.974 --> 40:09.272
Sources close to the CIA credit Special
Agent Jack Bauer...

40:09.376 --> 40:13.642
...of the LA Counter Terrorist Unit
as the man responsible for saving Palmer.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.427
Still nothing.

40:31.998 --> 40:35.730
- Have you searched the floor yet?
- Not yet, sir.

40:36.437 --> 40:37.562
Teri?

40:40.808 --> 40:42.297
Teri.

40:47.346 --> 40:48.905
Oh, my God.

40:54.220 --> 40:55.777
Come on, sweetheart.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.081
Come on.

41:02.861 --> 41:04.056
Come on.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.590
Oh, God.

41:09.135 --> 41:10.067
Teri?

41:11.669 --> 41:12.898
Teri, no.

41:15.606 --> 41:16.504
No.

41:17.776 --> 41:18.936
Teri.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.474
Please, no.

41:20.745 --> 41:22.212
Come on, baby.

41:22.413 --> 41:24.041
Come on.

41:27.351 --> 41:29.443
I'm glad you moved back in, Daddy.

41:31.389 --> 41:32.981
Me, too, sweetie.

41:33.425 --> 41:35.323
- Okay?
- Good.

41:35.425 --> 41:37.417
I really appreciate that.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.323
Really, really appreciate it?

41:39.429 --> 41:41.329
Or really appreciate it?

41:41.431 --> 41:44.332
How much?
I'll tell you.

41:48.704 --> 41:50.400
I'm so sorry.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.168
So sorry.
