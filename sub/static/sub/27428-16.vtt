00:03.473 --> 00:05.495
<i>After a recent string of setbacks,</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:08.550
<i>things were finally starting
to look up for young Zo-Zo.</i>

00:10.486 --> 00:12.863
<i>I'd successfully held down
a job at the bookstore</i>

00:12.888 --> 00:16.158
<i>for two weeks
and only called in sick twice.</i>

00:16.823 --> 00:19.326
<i>Shout-out to my work ethic!</i>

00:19.351 --> 00:23.188
<i>And I'd even complied with their
basic-ass khakis dress code.</i>

00:23.213 --> 00:26.570
<i>I was officially on my way
to financial freedom.</i>

00:28.441 --> 00:30.777
<i>Well, not exactly freedom.</i>

00:33.842 --> 00:36.791
<i>But at least like
a halfway house situation.</i>

00:36.816 --> 00:40.658
<i>But that wasn't all.
My academics had also improved.</i>

00:43.050 --> 00:46.489
<i>After all the hard work it took
to get my life back on track,</i>

00:46.514 --> 00:49.158
<i>not to mention getting
my car back from Dad,</i>

00:49.192 --> 00:52.128
<i>I decided it was time to reward myself</i>

00:52.153 --> 00:55.175
<i>with a weekend devoted to self-care.</i>

00:55.200 --> 00:59.735
<i>And as much as I deserved it,
my girls needed it even more.</i>

00:59.768 --> 01:02.517
<i>With Ana having her Aaron problems,</i>

01:02.542 --> 01:05.274
<i>and Nomi's situation
with Professor Hewson,</i>

01:05.308 --> 01:07.244
<i>I decided to take the MLK weekend...</i>

01:07.269 --> 01:08.675
<i>...and get out of town for a girls'</i>

01:08.699 --> 01:10.212
<i>self-care retreat.</i>

01:10.213 --> 01:11.594
Whoo!

01:13.148 --> 01:14.650
<i>And where better to do that</i>

01:14.684 --> 01:16.530
<i>than at my parents' empty house.</i>

01:16.555 --> 01:19.356
Ladies... welcome to serenity.

01:19.389 --> 01:21.591
Psh.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.860
More like paradise.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.128

01:29.332 --> 01:31.300

02:05.400 --> 02:07.570
What are you doing here?!

02:07.603 --> 02:09.238
And why in the world
did you not go skiing

02:09.270 --> 02:10.906
with the rest of the family?

02:10.940 --> 02:14.210
You may not realize it, Zoey,
but it is exhausting

02:14.244 --> 02:16.513
being our baby brother's
primary caregiver.

02:16.546 --> 02:18.882
Sometimes, I need
a break from skin-to-skin,

02:18.915 --> 02:20.382
and so does Devante.

02:20.416 --> 02:23.220
Whatever. Please just do not
bother us this weekend.

02:23.252 --> 02:25.154
Okay, Zoey! I see you!

02:25.187 --> 02:26.222
Come through, Johnsons!

02:26.256 --> 02:27.591
You know, I'm almost not mad at you

02:27.624 --> 02:29.326
for making us miss
the Martin Luther King Parade

02:29.358 --> 02:30.726
for the first time in our lives.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Zo, I thought that you said

02:32.428 --> 02:35.665
you grew up wealthy, but I mean,
are these floors even heated?

02:36.899 --> 02:39.269
Ladies! Welcome!

02:39.302 --> 02:41.937
Please, make yourselves at home.

02:41.971 --> 02:44.441
There are plenty of beds for everyone.

02:44.473 --> 02:47.543
I mean, obviously, you are
welcome to crash with me,

02:47.577 --> 02:50.780
assuming that you're not
allergic to spider silk.

02:50.812 --> 02:55.184
Um... can I actually talk to you
alone for a second?

03:01.056 --> 03:03.192
Night... mare.

03:03.226 --> 03:06.128
Junior. Sweet, sweet Junior.

03:06.162 --> 03:08.265
How do I say this gently?

03:08.298 --> 03:13.235
You know, me and you,
we shared one drunken,

03:13.269 --> 03:15.872
sweaty night on the dance floor,
and you made it rain on me,

03:15.905 --> 03:18.708
but, uh, that's pretty much
where it ends.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.410
You know, you're my girl's
brother, and I...

03:21.443 --> 03:25.482
I just don't want this
to become a... a "thing."

03:25.514 --> 03:28.618
Say no more.
I can read between the lines.

03:28.650 --> 03:30.653
- Okay.
- You're afraid I'll hurt you.

03:30.686 --> 03:33.756
Plus dating a single parent
isn't for everyone.

03:33.790 --> 03:36.425
You are not Devante's father!

03:37.592 --> 03:39.495
Spider silk.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.666
I'm disturbed.

03:43.699 --> 03:46.636
Okay. Yeah.

03:46.668 --> 03:47.836
It's all taken care of.

03:47.870 --> 03:50.840
Great! Well, in that case...

03:50.872 --> 03:52.775
we are here this weekend

03:52.809 --> 03:55.612
to cleanse our mind, body, and soul.

03:55.644 --> 03:58.415
Excuse me. I know Jesus.
My soul stays clean.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.916
Okay, well, that means no phones

04:00.949 --> 04:02.351
or social media,

04:02.384 --> 04:07.323
and definitely no alcohol,
drugs, or junk food.

04:08.858 --> 04:10.493
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm not going through

04:10.525 --> 04:13.295
this breakup without carbs.

04:13.328 --> 04:15.431
Do you have spaghetti
that I can dip this in?

04:15.465 --> 04:17.534
Honey, it wasn't, like,
really a breakup.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.500
- Yeah.
- You're right.

04:19.535 --> 04:21.503
I don't even get the dignity

04:21.536 --> 04:23.205
of a breakup title because I didn't even

04:23.239 --> 04:24.506
get the relationship!

04:24.540 --> 04:27.319
Uh, well, this...
this here is exactly why

04:27.335 --> 04:29.371
this weekend is so important.

04:29.404 --> 04:32.540
We need to heal ourselves
because no one else will.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.599
Right. So how exactly does
the healing happen?

04:35.624 --> 04:37.077
- Mm-hmm.
- Good question.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.748
By treating ourselves well,
clearing our heads,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.283
and relaxing, which actually brings me

04:42.316 --> 04:45.319
to our first self-care activity.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.790
Ooh!

04:49.823 --> 04:51.825
Adult coloring books.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.094
Ugh, white-people shit.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.996
And on MLK weekend.

04:56.029 --> 04:58.166
Mnh-mnh.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.434
Hi, it's me, Aaron.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.503
I'm a part of the Hawkins Brotherhood.

05:02.537 --> 05:06.474
While we here at Cal U enjoy
beautiful, well-kept facilities,

05:06.506 --> 05:09.109
our surrounding community
isn't so fortunate.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.477
There's no net here.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.481
How do you know if you
make it or not, you know? So...

05:13.513 --> 05:17.017
But we want to give these kids
the park they deserve.

05:17.051 --> 05:21.955
Uh, so, let's clean up
this park and pass...

05:21.989 --> 05:23.590
<i>a long-lasting legacy.</i>

05:23.623 --> 05:25.027
<i>[Bleep]</i>

05:28.895 --> 05:30.364
There you have it.

05:30.397 --> 05:31.866
There you have it. You guys feel that?

05:31.899 --> 05:33.601
<i>That</i> is why we are here.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.869
We have four regulation
basketball courts

05:35.902 --> 05:37.604
here in these privileged walls of Cal U,

05:37.638 --> 05:40.709
but the kids on the next block
don't even have a net...

05:40.741 --> 05:41.943
to put on their hoop.

05:41.976 --> 05:44.346
So, I want us to dig deep,

05:44.378 --> 05:46.013
and let's show these kids
that Titans care!

05:46.046 --> 05:47.622
We're taking donations right here.

05:47.647 --> 05:48.916
So, uh, yeah.

05:48.941 --> 05:51.452
We Titans care! All right, whoo!

05:51.486 --> 05:53.488
All right.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.789
Play the music, play the music.
Thank you. Enjoy yourselves.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.701
- What do you guys think?
- Call the cops, man!

05:58.726 --> 05:59.878
We murdered that video.

05:59.903 --> 06:02.120
Don't call anyone yet.
We didn't murder anything, okay?

06:02.145 --> 06:03.298
We still need donations.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.332
What are we looking like on that?

06:05.366 --> 06:06.700
$50... $50.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.404
Are you kidding me? That's it?! Guys...

06:09.436 --> 06:12.139
Bro, yo, give it some time, playboy.

06:12.173 --> 06:13.541
Yo, this joint's just getting started.

06:13.573 --> 06:16.544
Doug, I need you circulating,
getting this conversation started.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.678
We need donations.

06:17.712 --> 06:20.548
Vivek, this music... What is it? Wrong.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.182
We need something that makes
people want to give.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.485
Like, uh, Gucci Mane or,
um... Michael McDonald.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.986
- Gotcha.
- All right.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.522
As for me, it's go time.

06:28.556 --> 06:29.558
Ma'am!

06:32.560 --> 06:35.530
Oh, isn't this <i> so</i> soothing?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.432
No, it's whack.

06:37.465 --> 06:41.436
I did not miss the MLK parade
to color dumbass mermaids.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.938
We need some drinks.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.706
Look what I brought!

06:45.739 --> 06:47.708
Yes! Let's celebrate these civil rights.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.612
What? N-No! Guys, this weekend is
not about celebrating civil rights.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.114
Huh?

06:53.147 --> 06:55.450
And that sounded rough. Um, it is.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.852
But it is also about celebrating us.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.222
What kind of dry and dusty
celebration is this?

07:01.255 --> 07:02.557
I am bored as hell.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.590
- Yeah.
- Yes!

07:03.623 --> 07:04.624
- Excuse me.
- I will get the cups!

07:04.659 --> 07:08.529
Aw, y'all, we're gonna do
the ASMR videos next.

07:08.563 --> 07:11.466
"Dear Diary, Steve Newcomb

07:11.498 --> 07:14.469
is def the Lupe Fiasco
of our middle school.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.739
His Vines are like so on fleek!"

07:17.772 --> 07:19.774
Oh, my God. Where did you get that?

07:19.806 --> 07:21.775
I don't know, some random, sealed box

07:21.808 --> 07:24.546
that had your name on it
and said "do not open."

07:24.578 --> 07:26.713
- No. Well, guess what.
- Hmm?

07:26.746 --> 07:28.650
My diary is not for public consumption.

07:28.683 --> 07:29.918
Respect my privacy.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.652
Oh, come on!

07:31.686 --> 07:33.955
You have us locked up
in this bougie subdivision

07:33.988 --> 07:36.624
with no phones, no TV, and no [bleep].

07:36.657 --> 07:38.058
Let us have some fun.

07:38.092 --> 07:39.727
#self-care.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.094
- Fine.
- Yes.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.431
But I... will be doing the reading.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.499
- Okay.
- Yes!

07:44.532 --> 07:45.933
Oh, my God, this one.

07:45.967 --> 07:48.503
"Dear Diary, I can't believe my mom came

07:48.536 --> 07:50.505
to the roller rink
where Steve Newcomb and I

07:50.537 --> 07:52.005
were couple skating.

07:52.039 --> 07:55.510
O.M.G., tonight my life
literally ended."

07:55.542 --> 07:56.743
So what happened?

07:56.777 --> 07:59.080
Well, okay, all I did
was borrow a jacket

07:59.113 --> 08:01.950
she already told me I couldn't,
but I mean, it was so dope...

08:01.982 --> 08:04.985
like, big, white collar,
striped, couture, you know?

08:05.018 --> 08:07.754
Okay, that's baby bullshit
compared to what happened

08:07.787 --> 08:10.691
with Sky when she wrote
down about her first

08:10.724 --> 08:12.594
oral sex experience in her diary.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.528
- Wait, how old were you?!
- Okay, hold on.

08:17.798 --> 08:21.636
Okay, I thought it meant just
talking about sex, okay?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.505
So one day, ashy-backed Gerald...

08:26.541 --> 08:29.643
...decided to tell the whole
class a sex story during recess,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
and then I went home
and wrote in my diary

08:31.711 --> 08:34.215
that I'd had oral sex
with ashy-backed Gerald...

08:34.248 --> 08:35.883
Wait for it.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.017
...and then our dad read it.

08:37.051 --> 08:39.119
- Ohh!
- Oh, my gosh.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.455
- That's so embarrassing!
- Are you serious?

08:40.488 --> 08:42.357
Whoa!

08:42.389 --> 08:46.293
Sorry for the interruption,
ladies, but I just worked out.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.529
Please try not to stare.
You might hurt your eyes.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.032
Ignore him.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.202
Um, oh, wait, guys. Listen to this.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.671
This one is hilarious. Um...

08:57.705 --> 09:01.876
"Dear Diary, Hailey
thinks she is so friggin' cool

09:01.908 --> 09:04.044
with her rose gold iPod Touch..."

09:04.078 --> 09:05.713
"...but I don't even care

09:05.745 --> 09:08.482
because while she's making
Harlem Shake videos,

09:08.516 --> 09:11.486
I'm over here setting goals."

09:11.518 --> 09:13.720
"By the time I'm 20,
I'll have my own blog..."

09:13.753 --> 09:16.590
Well, I had a makeup vlog in,
like, high school,

09:16.623 --> 09:17.724
so chiggity check!

09:17.758 --> 09:19.927
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.863
"...I'll start my own fashion label..."

09:21.896 --> 09:23.698
You didn't do that.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.433
"...which Frank Ocean
will wear in one of his videos

09:26.466 --> 09:28.235
for like his fifth album..."

09:28.268 --> 09:29.937
That definitely didn't happen.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.674
"I cannot wait to leave L.A.
the moment I turn 18

09:33.708 --> 09:37.545
and take the world by storm.

09:37.578 --> 09:41.182
I know it'll be difficult
juggling being a college student

09:41.215 --> 09:46.620
and having a fashion career,
but I know I can do it."

09:46.653 --> 09:50.023
Oh, Zoey, you know
what else you didn't do?

09:50.056 --> 09:51.892
- Hmm?
- Any of that!

09:51.926 --> 09:54.561
Sorry, Diary. But you did eventually get

09:54.594 --> 09:58.298
an iPod Touch... that I broke, so...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.977
<i>Reading "Young Zoey's"
dreams and realizing</i>

10:07.002 --> 10:10.277
<i>how short "College Zoey" had
fallen of accomplishing them,</i>

10:10.311 --> 10:14.081
<i>it became clear I didn't
deserve to be rewarded at all.</i>

10:14.114 --> 10:16.750
What are you doing, Zo? You okay?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.719
Yeah, I don't know.

10:18.753 --> 10:21.623
Look at all this stuff...
ribbons and good grades

10:21.656 --> 10:25.392
and birthday cards from my dad
to his favorite child.

10:25.426 --> 10:27.996
This was me less than three
years ago, and I...

10:28.028 --> 10:31.832
I just... I just feel embarrassed.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.434
Like, how did I get so far off track?

10:34.468 --> 10:37.271
Okay, Zoey, step away from the box.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.741
Sit down. It's okay.

10:39.773 --> 10:42.743
Embarrassment is being
dumped on your own balcony

10:42.777 --> 10:45.412
by a guy you're not even
in a relationship with.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.210
I would've jumped. Or pushed his ass.

10:47.235 --> 10:48.749
Either way, somebody would've wound up

10:48.773 --> 10:49.827
- on that street.
- Yeah.

10:49.852 --> 10:52.086
Okay, but I'm working at a bookstore.

10:52.118 --> 10:55.455
That has nothing... zero...
to do with fashion.

10:55.489 --> 10:58.792
I totally get starting at
the bottom... it's necessary...

10:58.825 --> 11:00.827
but this isn't even the right bottom.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.796
Like, I should be so much further ahead.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.032
I get it. I thought I'd be some

11:05.065 --> 11:06.868
Olympic gold medalist by now.

11:06.901 --> 11:08.703
And Sky would at least be bronze.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.203
Your mama's bronze.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.873
All right, you guys,
we need to relax here.

11:11.906 --> 11:14.842
We're 19, okay? We have plenty of time

11:14.874 --> 11:17.210
to establish our careers
and our love lives.

11:17.243 --> 11:20.882
Well... you can say that, Nomi,
because you're good.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.116
You have straight A's.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.484
No financial pressures.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.219
No relationship drama.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.188
Oh, my God, come on.
You guys are acting like

11:27.220 --> 11:29.022
I live this charmed life with, like,

11:29.056 --> 11:30.958
heated floors and organic applesauce.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.394
Okay, I have... I have things
that I'm dealing with.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.998
- Like what?!
- Name one. Just one.

11:39.499 --> 11:41.668
Like I'm dating Professor Hewson.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.703
- What?!
- Huh?

11:42.737 --> 11:44.872
- Huh?
- Hold on. What?!

11:44.905 --> 11:45.707
Who?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.510
How's it looking?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.646
Horrible. Got it.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.082
Uh, excuse me, fellas.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.883
Hey, not to interrupt, uh...
I don't know if you saw me.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.186
I'm Aaron, the dude
from the video earlier...

11:58.219 --> 12:00.588
well-directed, well-acted...
and I was just asking, uh,

12:00.620 --> 12:02.823
if you'd be willing to donate to
these kids in our community, man.

12:02.857 --> 12:04.826
It would help out a lot,
and I see your kicks,

12:04.859 --> 12:06.359
so I know you got it. All right?

12:06.392 --> 12:08.495
Yeah, I'm wit' it.
Love what you're doing.

12:08.528 --> 12:11.364
Really? Thank you.
That means a lot, bro.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.100
Guys, you see what I'm talking about?

12:13.133 --> 12:14.568
This man, um...

12:14.601 --> 12:16.703
- Mauricio.
- ...Mau... Mauricio

12:16.737 --> 12:18.439
is stepping up and being the change

12:18.471 --> 12:19.906
that he wants to see in the world.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.844
Now, Mauricio just
generously donated to us...

12:22.877 --> 12:24.779
$5. $5?

12:24.811 --> 12:27.047
What are these kids supposed
to do with $5?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.249
Um, I said "be the change,"
not "give me change."

12:29.282 --> 12:30.884
- Do you wanna up this...
- Bro, relax.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.387
On top of that $5, I paid $10 to get in.

12:33.420 --> 12:34.756
Fall back.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.123
Fall back.

12:36.157 --> 12:37.557
How about you fall back on my drinks?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.926
I've seen you drink
at least $30 worth of Cuban rum,

12:39.960 --> 12:42.195
but all you can give these kids is $5?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.464
That's the type of man you are?

12:43.497 --> 12:44.987
Man [bleep] you and them kids.

12:45.012 --> 12:46.190
- Who you talking to?
- Chill.

12:46.215 --> 12:47.541
- Y'all better get your boy!
- No, who you talking to?!

12:47.566 --> 12:49.362
He don't know 'Ricio.
Like, for real, for real.

12:49.387 --> 12:50.947
No, you know what?
All y'all drinking and eating

12:50.972 --> 12:54.541
for free, you don't give
a damn about the community!

12:54.575 --> 12:57.244
Is Professor Hewson the one
who called you a misogynist?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.113
<i>You</i> called me a misogynist.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.915
- Yeah.
- Hold up, is that how you got

13:00.947 --> 13:02.883
an "A" in that class
while I've been busy

13:02.916 --> 13:05.619
busting my ass over this
boring feminism propaganda?

13:05.652 --> 13:08.156
No. I got an "A" because
I'm an "A" student.

13:08.189 --> 13:09.457
And we didn't even start dating

13:09.489 --> 13:11.959
until the semester was over... ish.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.962
Even so, she's still the professor,

13:14.994 --> 13:16.730
and you're the student.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.299
You don't think that's
a messed-up power dynamic?

13:19.333 --> 13:21.903
Is it? They're two consenting adults.

13:21.936 --> 13:24.305
- Yeah.
- With a 20-year age difference!

13:24.338 --> 13:26.240
So what? It works out for Sarah Paulson

13:26.272 --> 13:27.908
and whatever old lady she's dating.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.243
And can you imagine
how wrong it would feel

13:30.277 --> 13:33.314
if she was a 40-year-old <i> male</i> professor?

13:33.346 --> 13:36.683
But she's not, and a lot of things

13:36.716 --> 13:39.287
would be different if
the genders were reversed.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.922
Guys, I honestly think it's fine.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.490
Well, how do you feel?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.458
You've just been sitting here
quiet the whole time.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.995
I mean, I'm sure you have
something to say.

13:48.027 --> 13:49.864
Mm-hmm.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.300
I already know how Zoey feels.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.301
- Yeah.
- How?

13:53.334 --> 13:55.837
What? Wait, you told her?

13:57.805 --> 13:59.507
Not exactly.

14:05.679 --> 14:08.983
Wow! We are the most
secret-keeping group of bitches

14:09.016 --> 14:10.618
I have ever met.

14:11.752 --> 14:13.054
I'm proud of us.

14:13.086 --> 14:16.623
Okay, fine, you know what? I-I think...

14:16.657 --> 14:20.161
I think that Nomi
is an amazing human being,

14:20.194 --> 14:23.130
and I honestly trust
whatever she chooses

14:23.162 --> 14:24.565
is right for her.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.335
And that's Professor Hewson.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.003
- Wow.
- Yeah.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.304
Thank you, Zoey.

14:30.336 --> 14:31.404
Of course.

14:31.437 --> 14:33.874
But I still think that telling
the both of you was a big mistake.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.642
You guys are honestly being harsher

14:35.676 --> 14:37.711
than Paige even predicted you would be.

14:37.744 --> 14:41.181
Okay, you know, no judgment,
Nomi, just pure curiosity.

14:41.215 --> 14:44.730
Like, what led you to smashing
our gross old-lady professor?

14:44.755 --> 14:46.586
Okay,<i> you're</i> gross, first of all,

14:46.619 --> 14:48.255
and Paige is amazing, okay?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.657
And we have a real connection.

14:50.690 --> 14:53.360
She's smart, and she's interesting,

14:53.393 --> 14:56.062
and she's given me
so much great life advice.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.998
I mean, she's the reason
why I was honest

14:58.032 --> 15:00.100
and finally came out
to my parents, okay?

15:00.133 --> 15:02.903
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm really happy for you.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.071
Thank you.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.507
I'ma pray for you.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.075
Yeah, you know what?
This is exactly why Paige

15:09.109 --> 15:10.378
told me not to say
anything, because people

15:10.411 --> 15:12.513
- are narrow-minded.
- Okay, fine.

15:12.546 --> 15:14.047
I'ma pray for Paige's old ass, too.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.916
Mm-hmm. God is good.

15:15.950 --> 15:17.051
I need to smoke.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.585
- I need a drink.
- I need spaghetti.

15:18.618 --> 15:19.719
Are you serious?

15:19.753 --> 15:21.254
Okay.

15:23.000 --> 15:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:34.734 --> 15:38.104
We're just six hours into
my self-care weekend,

15:38.138 --> 15:40.974
and it's already a total bust.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.277
Per usual, yet another one
of my well-intentioned goals

15:44.311 --> 15:46.247
just dies a-a painful...

15:46.280 --> 15:48.582
Oh, my God!

15:48.614 --> 15:50.350
Uh!

15:51.851 --> 15:53.486
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

15:54.754 --> 15:57.157
Excuse you! What?!

15:57.190 --> 15:58.960
I thought we were practicing self-care.

15:58.993 --> 16:00.628
Hmm.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.501
- Don't worry about them.
- Okay.

16:08.002 --> 16:09.904
Wow.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.072
Wow.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.707
Wow!

16:16.442 --> 16:19.013
I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty happy that

16:19.046 --> 16:22.083
the heat about inappropriate
relationships is off me.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.450
Oh.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.921
What?

16:26.954 --> 16:28.989
She's the one who brought up
self-care at me,

16:29.022 --> 16:30.791
and I was just trying to stay on theme.

16:33.027 --> 16:34.195
Wha...

16:34.228 --> 16:36.763
It is not funny, guys!

16:36.796 --> 16:38.099
- I'm sorry.
- It's kinda funny.

16:38.132 --> 16:39.333
I do not know

16:39.365 --> 16:42.268
what the hell is
so amusing about all this!

16:42.301 --> 16:44.171
I mean, I just watched my little brother

16:44.204 --> 16:46.007
and one of my best friends in the tub

16:46.040 --> 16:48.009
doing God knows what to your feet!

16:48.041 --> 16:49.009
Oh, I can tell you.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.878
No!

16:50.911 --> 16:52.880
Ugh! You know what?

16:52.912 --> 16:54.681
Self-care weekend is officially over,

16:54.715 --> 16:57.785
so y'all can do whatever you
wanna do because I have failed.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.819
Listen, okay, you made a valiant effort,

16:59.853 --> 17:01.789
but you can't just carve out
a weekend and then suddenly

17:01.821 --> 17:04.058
- expect everything to be solved.
- Mm-hmm.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.292
Yeah, Zoey, it's like how
you are with your curls.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.627
It just doesn't happen overnight.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.195
- It's a process.
- Mm-hmm.

17:10.230 --> 17:12.665
First you start off
by trimming off the dead ends,

17:12.698 --> 17:14.233
then you gotta find the right products,

17:14.268 --> 17:16.170
then you pineapple it at night,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.070
and then you plunk it in the morning.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.407
It's about maintenance.
Just like self-care.

17:20.441 --> 17:23.176
Yeah, you practice
a little bit of it every day.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.678
And, you know, you can't
get curl and life goals

17:25.712 --> 17:27.915
in one weekend.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.483
Wow, you're right.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.518
Well, you know what? I just wish
you would've told me that

17:31.551 --> 17:34.487
before I spent my last check
on those coloring books.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.424
I said I wanted spaghetti!

17:36.456 --> 17:37.757
Yes.

17:37.791 --> 17:39.592
Should we have, um, spaghetti and wine?

17:39.626 --> 17:41.862
- I would really love that.
- Spaghetti and wine!

17:41.895 --> 17:43.497
Spaghetti and wine!

17:43.530 --> 17:45.166
Spaghetti and wine!

17:45.198 --> 17:48.735
Yo, bro, you need to
calm that down, man.

17:48.769 --> 17:50.905
Real talk, you don't want
problems with 'Ricio.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.174
This can't just be about
Mauricio and that dumb donation.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.774
No, it's not just that, okay?

17:54.808 --> 17:57.211
It's the fact that I...
I've been busy being an R.A.,

17:57.243 --> 18:00.214
I've been busy partying, and
this whole Zoey and Ana thing.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.082
You know?
This is the first time this year

18:02.116 --> 18:04.218
that I've done a fundraiser,
and I couldn't even get a stack

18:04.251 --> 18:06.020
to help clean up a park, you know?

18:06.052 --> 18:09.389
I've... I just feel
like I've lost focus.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.592
Hey, come on, man.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.963
Don't be so hard on yourself, man.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.197
Look.

18:17.231 --> 18:19.532
I think if you take
a look at this total,

18:19.566 --> 18:23.137
you'll see you surpassed your goal.

18:23.169 --> 18:24.938
Are you serious? You... You did this?

18:24.972 --> 18:27.041
Yeah, man! You inspired me!

18:27.073 --> 18:29.109
Yeah, I see you out here doing
your little activism thing,

18:29.143 --> 18:30.277
and I admire that.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.746
And plus, I'm a very successful
drug dealer, you know.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.216
I am genuinely touched, man. Thank you.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.119
All right, cute,
but y'all wanna wrap this up?

18:39.153 --> 18:40.921
We're sitting ducks out here.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.224
Big 'Ricio never forgets, man.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.060
Man, will you chill, please?
Nobody's worried about Big 'Ricio.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.094
- Hold up.
- What?

18:48.128 --> 18:49.664
Why does that Jetta
not have his headlights on?

18:52.698 --> 18:54.834
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

18:54.868 --> 18:57.771
<i>So, in some weird way,
the self-care weekend</i>

18:57.803 --> 19:00.273
<i>had actually turned out to be a success.</i>

19:00.307 --> 19:04.311
<i>We didn't need all the coloring
books, tea, or clean eating.</i>

19:04.343 --> 19:06.846
<i>Apparently, we just
needed some quality time</i>

19:06.879 --> 19:09.082
<i>to purge some of our secrets.</i>

19:09.116 --> 19:11.185
<i>And a good laugh at my brother's expense.</i>

19:11.217 --> 19:12.519
There we go!

19:15.438 --> 19:19.160
<i>"Dear Diary, if I had to pick
one thing to do</i>

19:19.193 --> 19:21.829
<i>for my 14th birthday party,
it would be to raid</i>

19:21.861 --> 19:24.264
<i>my mother's closet and do a fashion show</i>

19:24.298 --> 19:25.366
<i>with my best friends."</i>

19:25.398 --> 19:29.869
Here it is... the infamous jacket.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.372
- This woman throws nothing away.
- Oh, my God.

19:31.405 --> 19:33.941
Oh, my gosh. Dude, your mom's clothes

19:33.974 --> 19:35.309
are so sick.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.511
I know. I mean,
this jacket was almost worth

19:37.543 --> 19:39.345
the roller-rink humiliation.

19:39.378 --> 19:40.680
Oh, yeah.

19:40.714 --> 19:42.816
Huh?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.952
- Wh...
- You guys...

19:44.984 --> 19:46.820
You know what we should do?

19:49.156 --> 19:50.191
Yes, please.
