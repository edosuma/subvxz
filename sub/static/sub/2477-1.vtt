(Moans)

02:00.750 --> 02:05.085
- (Giggles) It tickles.
- Want me to stop?

02:05.208 --> 02:08.417
Yeah, can you just come up
here and fuck me, please?

02:08.542 --> 02:09.758
OK.

02:11.625 --> 02:13.593
No, no, no.
Not right after. Come on.

02:13.708 --> 02:17.417
- Oh, I'm sorry, I won't.
- (Laughs) Don't you dare!

02:19.292 --> 02:20.885
Take this off.

02:32.208 --> 02:35.007
I brushed my teeth, I brushed
my teeth, I brushed my... Mmm.

02:37.208 --> 02:38.835
- Have you set the alarm?
- Mm-hm.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.426
- Paul?
- Hm?

02:47.542 --> 02:51.217
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Of course, honey. What?

02:54.625 --> 02:58.630
I want to tell you something
but I'm embarrassed.

02:58.750 --> 03:00.297
Say it.

03:00.417 --> 03:05.844
Well, I need you... I need you
not to judge me. OK?

03:05.958 --> 03:08.632
It's important
that you don't judge me.

03:08.750 --> 03:12.755
- Promise me you won't.
- Hey, sweetheart, what?

03:17.208 --> 03:19.006
I want you to rape me.

03:23.208 --> 03:25.631
- That's it?
- Yes.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.844
That's what you were
embarrassed about?

03:27.958 --> 03:29.175
Yes.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.631
- OK.
- Really?

03:32.750 --> 03:34.718
Of course.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.006
You're a ten, babe.

03:38.125 --> 03:41.208
You're a fucking
ten out of ten.

03:41.333 --> 03:44.633
You're 20 out of ten. To me.
You're five stars.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.003
Yeah? Come here.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.335
Feel better?

04:00.625 --> 04:04.630
Uh... No. Paul.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.335
Honey, not...

04:10.000 --> 04:11.673
Not "'rate" me.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.627
<i>Rape</i> me.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.005
- What?
- I want you to rape me.

04:29.625 --> 04:33.209
- You want what?
- You to rape me.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.627
- You want me to rape you?
- Yes.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.959
- What are you talking about?
- It's a fantasy of mine.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.335
What, getting raped?

04:46.458 --> 04:48.210
Yeah, it's like
your foot thing.

04:48.333 --> 04:51.462
Um, it's a bit different,
I think, hon.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.085
- How?
- How?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.802
How is sucking your toes
different from me raping you?

04:55.917 --> 04:57.464
Oh, come on,
you know what I mean.

04:57.583 --> 04:59.585
It's something
I've always wanted to try.

04:59.708 --> 05:01.460
I just thought it might be
a nice thing

05:01.583 --> 05:03.085
for us to talk about.

05:03.208 --> 05:05.427
- You know, just to be honest.
- Yeah.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.460
- I'm going to...
- (Yelps, laughs)

05:10.583 --> 05:11.755
No? What?

05:11.875 --> 05:13.673
- Not now, not now.
- No? When?

05:13.792 --> 05:16.215
- Um, I don't want to know.
- OK, tomorrow, or...?

05:16.333 --> 05:17.880
No, no, I don't want to know,
Paul.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.172
I'm working late on Friday

05:19.292 --> 05:21.010
if you want
to knock it on the head...

05:21.125 --> 05:23.127
You're not listening.
I don't want to know.

05:23.250 --> 05:25.594
I don't want to know when.
I don't want to know where.

05:25.708 --> 05:29.212
I don't even want to know...
for sure...

05:29.333 --> 05:32.712
- Yeah?
- ..That it's you.

05:34.625 --> 05:35.797
Right.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.002
Yeah, I don't know
how to take that, babe.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.843
Honey, it's a
really common fantasy.

05:40.958 --> 05:43.006
Yeah, I'm not 100% sure
it is, hon.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.378
It is actually and you said
you wouldn't judge me.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.127
No, I didn't.
I absolutely did not.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.923
How did you expect I'd react,
Maeve?

05:49.042 --> 05:50.544
You just told me
you had a fantasy

05:50.667 --> 05:51.839
that doesn't involve me!

05:51.958 --> 05:53.460
No, what? Yes, it does!

05:53.583 --> 05:55.506
You said you want to be raped
but not by me.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.629
No! Oh, no, no, no, darling,
that's not what I meant.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.549
Oh, my God,
you are so fucking beautiful.

06:01.667 --> 06:03.635
No, I want to be raped by you.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.047
No, you don't.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.636
Yes, you are the only man in
the world I want to rape me.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.252
I love you
but because I love you

06:09.375 --> 06:11.673
and because you're the only
man I want to be with,

06:11.792 --> 06:13.294
I want you to have sex with me.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.010
Oh, Pauly, I adore you.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.426
I just want for one little
second, like, to fear

06:19.542 --> 06:22.011
what might be like
if it was somebody else.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.004
- Does that make sense?
- Not really.

06:32.417 --> 06:34.840
OK, go to sleep, we'll talk
about it another time.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.335
Blowjobs.

07:01.208 --> 07:02.835
- That's good, Daniel.
- It's Dan.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.835
Forgive me, that's good, Dan.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.006
Let's explore blowjobs.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.173
(Sighs) It's going to come
out the wrong way.

07:09.292 --> 07:10.885
There is no wrong way.

07:15.000 --> 07:18.425
- Her blowjobs...
- Say it... to Evie.

07:25.625 --> 07:27.252
Your blowjobs...

07:30.833 --> 07:33.882
...aren't... very...

07:35.958 --> 07:37.505
...good.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.423
They're not...
They're not that bad.

07:47.417 --> 07:48.919
They are.

07:50.417 --> 07:53.751
Well, you remember the last
time you went down on me, Dan?

07:53.875 --> 07:55.627
- 'Cause I don't.
- OK. OK.

07:55.750 --> 07:58.549
- Regularity's not the issue.
- Let's just... take a breath.

08:01.208 --> 08:03.210
When was the last time
you had sex?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.840
- Um...
- (Clears throat)

08:06.958 --> 08:10.838
- Like, um...
- It was, um, it was...

08:12.417 --> 08:14.419
It was last month
before your fun run.

08:15.542 --> 08:17.089
Was it?

08:17.208 --> 08:22.635
OK. What seems to be missing
here is communication.

08:22.750 --> 08:25.629
But you're both struggling
with that.

08:25.750 --> 08:28.959
So as an experiment tonight...

08:30.833 --> 08:33.427
...don't be Evie and Dan.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.217
Instead,
be two different people

08:36.332 --> 08:38.586
who aren't afraid to say
what they want.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.210

09:02.000 --> 09:05.834

- I'm sorry.

I'm going to need to ask you
a few questions,

09:25.500 --> 09:27.002
if that's alright.

09:27.125 --> 09:29.002
- Depends.
- On what?

09:29.125 --> 09:33.210
On whether you're the good cop
or the bad cop.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.052
- Which one are ya?
- Guess.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.801

09:53.625 --> 09:57.425
Now, Miss Redding,
are you going to cooperate?

09:59.625 --> 10:01.343
Fuck me.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.427
But they're watching us
behind the mirror.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.089
Don't care. Fuck me.

- Yeah.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.837
- You were amazing.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.834
- So strong and believable.
- Really?

10:39.958 --> 10:41.460
Yeah.

10:43.417 --> 10:46.216
I mean it, Dan, maybe
you should have been an actor.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.627
(Kisses him)

10:58.833 --> 11:00.835
You have the right

Everything you say... You have
the right to remain silent.

16:40.750 --> 16:43.629
- Oh, right,
- What, it's been five years?

16:43.750 --> 16:45.423
BOTH: Six.
- Six?

16:45.542 --> 16:47.419
- Yeah.
- So what are you waiting for?

16:47.542 --> 16:50.091
- OK, that's enough.
- No, it's OK, it's fine.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.633
Uh, no, it's, like, we're not
really waiting for anything.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.833
We're just not really marriage
kind of people, that's all.

16:56.958 --> 16:58.551
Yeah.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.003
What? We've talked about this.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.377
- I know.
- We laughed about it.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.719
We said we didn't need to go
through all that.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.835
Yeah, I know. I know.

17:10.833 --> 17:12.835
Um, should we do dessert?

17:12.958 --> 17:14.585
- Yes, please!
- Let's do that.

17:14.708 --> 17:16.210
- Great.
- Thank you.

17:16.333 --> 17:17.835
Thanks, darling.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.881
- You OK?
- Hmm.

17:25.000 --> 17:29.005
- You seem a little bit...
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

17:34.417 --> 17:36.795
Hey, can I ask you something?
Have you ever...

17:36.917 --> 17:39.636
Have you ever... (Sighs)

17:39.750 --> 17:42.299
Have you ever raped anybody?

17:44.625 --> 17:48.300
No. Who's been saying that?

17:48.417 --> 17:52.001
- No-one, no, it's...
- Have you?

17:52.125 --> 17:53.627
No.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.799
No, I haven't and that's the
thing. I don't really want to.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.628
Mate, that's good.
That's good.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.844
- You don't have to.
- No.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.007
(Laughs) Mate, I'm not...

18:06.125 --> 18:08.628
No, it's not that, it's...
It's not me, it's...

18:08.750 --> 18:11.424
It's Maeve.
She's got this, uh...

18:11.542 --> 18:12.839
What?

18:12.958 --> 18:15.006
I don't even know
what you call it.

18:15.125 --> 18:20.211
- That thing, this, uh...
- Oh. Like a fantasy?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.836
Yeah. A fantasy.
How did you know that?

18:22.958 --> 18:25.632
(Laughs) OK.
Rape fantasy - very common.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.252
No shit. That's what she said.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.127
Yeah. Yael's got one.
Massive one.

18:29.250 --> 18:33.630
- Really? And you've never...?
- No, can't be done.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.003
I've tried but
it's a ﬂawed fantasy.

18:36.125 --> 18:37.718
- Not possible.
- Why?

18:37.833 --> 18:39.335
Well, think about it.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.632
The moment someone asks to
be raped, it stops being rape.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.629
Right? It's only rape
if they don't want it.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.003
- She wants it - not rape.
- Right.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.127
The reason they can't get
what they want

18:50.250 --> 18:52.002
is because they want it.

18:53.208 --> 18:54.835
God, that doesn't seem fair.

18:54.958 --> 18:56.460
Sucks, mate.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.506
There's got to be something
I can do.

18:59.625 --> 19:01.127
I just want to make her happy.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.423
Whatever happened
to good, old-fashioned...

19:03.542 --> 19:05.135
- ..run-of-the-mill sex?
- Yeah.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.844
People have to complicate it
with all this kinky shit.

19:07.958 --> 19:09.130
Yeah.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.218
You don't have anything
like that, do ya?

19:11.333 --> 19:12.960
- Hm?
- No weird fetish?

19:13.083 --> 19:16.633
Nah. I mean, define "weird",
you know.

19:33.542 --> 19:36.295
(Doorbell chimes)

19:36.417 --> 19:37.919
Hi.

19:38.042 --> 19:41.467
- Hi! Hi, sorry to bother you.
- That's OK.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.836
Uh, were you in the middle
of something?

19:43.958 --> 19:46.381
Oh, no, we're just having
some lunch. It's alright.

19:46.500 --> 19:48.093
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's fine.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.085
I'll be quick.
Um, my name's Steve.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.427
I've just moved in
down the road.

19:52.542 --> 19:55.011
- Oh, we've just moved in too.
- Hey, how about that!

19:55.125 --> 19:57.219
- Hello, welcome.
- Thank you.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.586
Well, as I said,
I won't keep you.

19:59.708 --> 20:01.381
- I'm doing the rounds.
- Nice.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.127
- Visiting the neighbours.
- Good.

20:03.250 --> 20:04.797
And I wanted to give you these.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.669
- Aww... (Gasps)
- My Way of saying hi.

20:06.792 --> 20:09.636
Oh, my God. Golliwogs.

20:13.208 --> 20:16.257
Also, I am required
by federal law to inform you

20:16.375 --> 20:18.252
that I am a convicted
sex offender.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.843
Where did you find Golliwogs?

20:21.958 --> 20:23.835
I didn't think
they made them anymore.

20:23.958 --> 20:25.835
- No, they don't, I do.
- Oh!

20:25.958 --> 20:27.710
Yeah, baking
is my little hobby.

20:27.833 --> 20:30.507
Amazing. I haven't seen these
since I was a kid.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.218
I think they stopped
making them

20:32.333 --> 20:34.586
on account of
the, you know, racism.

20:34.708 --> 20:38.008
- Yeah, makes you think.
- Yeah, it does.

20:39.208 --> 20:41.210
OK, well, I won't keep you
any longer.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.835
- OK, thanks, Dan.
- Steve.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.960
Steve! Sorry. Maeve.
Nice to meet you.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.302
- Nice to meet you too.
- Thanks so much for this.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.964
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you, bye.

- I said I don't know.

27:17.417 --> 27:20.842

27:31.333 --> 27:33.006
I've just moved in
down the road.

27:33.125 --> 27:36.129
And I thought I'd just pop in
and introduce myself.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.844
- I'm Steve.
- Uh, Phil.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.631
Pleasure to meet you, Phil.

27:42.208 --> 27:45.758
Those are my little"'Howdy,
neighbour" gifts... for you.

27:50.208 --> 27:51.710
God, this takes me back.

27:53.042 --> 27:54.544
A simpler time.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.544
It really was.

27:59.625 --> 28:01.844
Also, I'm required
by federal law to inform you

28:01.958 --> 28:03.710
that I am a convicted
sex offender.

28:05.625 --> 28:07.343
This is so nice of you.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.755
(Sniffs)

28:32.125 --> 28:33.843
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.710
Baby, you're not crying.

28:38.833 --> 28:40.710
I don't think I have
any tears left in me.

28:40.833 --> 28:42.835
I'm sure there's a few more
in there.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.960
I mean, your dad
only just died.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.630
Ooh. Baby, shush.

28:50.625 --> 28:54.050
(Richard moans)

29:08.042 --> 29:10.215
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mrs Hawkins.

29:10.333 --> 29:12.051
Actually, doctor, it's "Miss".

29:12.167 --> 29:14.465
Well, Miss Hawkins,
why don't you take a seat?

29:16.625 --> 29:19.834
You look very sexy
in that outfit, doctor.

29:19.958 --> 29:22.837
Now, Miss Hawkins, I have
the results of your test here.

29:22.958 --> 29:26.041
Oh, yes. Will you need
to examine me further?

29:26.167 --> 29:28.215
Uh, no, no, it's conclusive.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.756
And I'm afraid it's bad news.

29:30.875 --> 29:33.219
Well, I have been
a very bad girl.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.836
- Perhaps you need to...
- You have hepatitis.

29:38.208 --> 29:40.427
- Sorry, what?
- Hepatitis.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.710
Well, that's not very sexy,
is it?

29:45.833 --> 29:49.633
No, no, it's not.
Particularly not hepatitis C.

29:51.833 --> 29:56.418
So, I'm going to prescribe you
a course of interferon

29:56.542 --> 29:58.294
and I'll give you the number

29:58.417 --> 30:00.795
of a support group in the area.

30:01.833 --> 30:04.052
And I'll see you again
in a couple of weeks.

30:12.417 --> 30:14.840
- Sorry, Dan, I'm confused...
- Dan?

30:14.958 --> 30:16.835
It's "'Doctor"! Stay in it!

30:16.958 --> 30:18.460
Now we have to start again.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.426
No, no, we don't have
to start again.

30:20.542 --> 30:23.261
- Just getting good too!
- How was it getting good?

30:23.375 --> 30:24.877
Why do I have hepatitis?

30:25.000 --> 30:29.005
Because I thought that your
character was, you know,

30:29.125 --> 30:31.423
like, maybe got around a bit.

30:31.542 --> 30:34.170
You know, a bit slutty.
I thought that would be sexy.

30:34.292 --> 30:35.635
I'm not gonna want to have sex

30:35.750 --> 30:37.673
if you've just diagnosed me
with an STD.

30:39.625 --> 30:42.959
Just... Just make me
feel sexy.

30:45.042 --> 30:46.544
Alright, alright, alright.

30:46.667 --> 30:49.045
Do it again. I promise
I'll make you feel sexy, OK?

30:49.167 --> 30:51.044
Um, go back to your spot.

30:51.167 --> 30:53.841
I'll start here and...

30:56.417 --> 30:59.421
- You alright?
- Just feel a bit hot.

31:00.833 --> 31:02.631
Oh, is this part of the...?
We started?

31:02.750 --> 31:04.423
Miss Hawkins,
I need to speak...

31:06.042 --> 31:08.215
- (Vomiting)
- Baby, you OK?

31:10.042 --> 31:12.420
Hey. Hey, what's the matter?

31:13.625 --> 31:16.048
Hey, you're right.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.710
You're right.

31:20.208 --> 31:22.051
Good thing I'm a doctor, eh?

31:37.917 --> 31:40.420
(Silence)

31:46.833 --> 31:49.427
(Mufﬂed sounds
becoming clearer)

(Muffled scream)

33:53.875 --> 33:55.502
- Ah!
- Oh, ah, sorry.

34:03.250 --> 34:07.084
- (Grunts)
- Shh.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.801
You're not fighting. You know.

34:18.917 --> 34:21.966
- Keep going. Just keep going.
- How do you know?

34:22.083 --> 34:25.257
No, no, baby. Your smell.
Just keep going.

34:25.375 --> 34:26.717
Shit.

34:29.083 --> 34:32.087
- (Sighs) My smell.
- Just keep going.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.882
I even got these clothes
from a second-hand store.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.627
It's still good, baby,
keep going.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.252
- No.
- Yes, yes, yes.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.469
No, I fucked it. I'm sorry.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.377
Oh, come here.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.882
- For a second, though?
- Yeah, definitely.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.674
Yeah? I'm sorry
about the groceries.

34:50.792 --> 34:52.886
- It's OK.
- I heard something crack.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.752
- Eggs.
- Shit.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.422
- The eggs?
- Yeah, it's OK.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.169
- Really? I'll get more eggs.
- Shh.

34:58.292 --> 35:00.044
- I'm sorry.
- Shh.

35:00.167 --> 35:01.635
It's OK.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.593
- Hey!
- Hey.

35:11.250 --> 35:13.093
- Are you still working?
- Yeah.

35:13.208 --> 35:14.801
I'm just cleaning stuff out.

35:14.917 --> 35:17.466
It's good, actually. It's
keeping my mind off things.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.085
You need to take a break, baby.

35:19.208 --> 35:21.051
You want to watch a movie
or something?

35:21.167 --> 35:22.669
- Um... yeah, sure.
- Yeah?

35:22.792 --> 35:24.544
I thought we could watch one
in bed?

35:24.667 --> 35:26.590
- Alright.
- Alright.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.927
Actually, I picked up a couple
on my way home.

35:29.042 --> 35:30.544
What have I got?

35:30.667 --> 35:32.920
I have got Sophie's Choice
or Philadelphia.

35:33.042 --> 35:34.669
Any comedies?

35:34.792 --> 35:36.294
Might be a bit heavy for me,
hon.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.960
Oh.

35:40.042 --> 35:41.635
Well, maybe later?

35:41.750 --> 35:44.094
Will you come and help me
make some dinner?

35:44.208 --> 35:46.381
Yeah, yeah, just give me
a couple of minutes.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.344
Alright, well, I'll leave
the onions on the bench

35:49.458 --> 35:50.960
for you to cut, OK?

35:51.083 --> 35:52.585
Just... Onions again?

35:52.708 --> 35:54.881
Jesus, Ro, no offence,
I'm a bit onioned out.

35:55.000 --> 35:56.718
I feel like
we've been eating onions

35:56.833 --> 35:58.380
every night for the past week.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.002
OK, alright.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.593
OK.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.256
- How was your day?
- It was good.

36:12.375 --> 36:14.673
It was exhausting but good.

36:14.792 --> 36:17.671
Oh, that's nice.

36:19.250 --> 36:21.844
So you haven't been thinking
about your dad at all?

36:21.958 --> 36:24.677
(Sighs) Well, I am now.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.752
Why did you bring up Dad?

36:27.875 --> 36:30.879
Well, you just haven't spoken
about him in a few days.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.673
You must miss him.

36:34.667 --> 36:36.544
I'm just trying not to think
about it.

36:36.667 --> 36:39.136
Can we just talk about
something else?

36:39.250 --> 36:41.673
Hey, you remember
when he used to leave

36:41.792 --> 36:44.261
those ridiculously long
messages on your phone

36:44.375 --> 36:46.878
and you wouldn't even finish
listening to them?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.594
You'd just delete them.

36:49.708 --> 36:53.667
You ever think about that
and wish you hadn't done that?

36:53.792 --> 36:55.669
(Cries) God...

36:55.792 --> 36:59.092
Hey. Hey, hey.

36:59.208 --> 37:02.087
Honey. Hey, what's wrong?
Look at me.

37:02.208 --> 37:03.881
I just miss him so much.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.469
Hey, it's alright, sweetheart.
It's OK.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.881
I've got you, honey,
I've got you.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.469
Hey, what... Are you serious?

37:12.667 --> 37:14.169
What, I thought you wanted...

37:14.292 --> 37:16.920
What, I wanted a handjob while
I thought about my dead dad?

37:17.042 --> 37:18.544
No. Thanks.

37:25.667 --> 37:27.419
Hello, girl.

37:29.083 --> 37:30.926
You're my good girl,
aren't you?

37:33.250 --> 37:34.752
My best girl.

37:34.875 --> 37:37.048
I love you. I love you.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.752
OK.

37:44.583 --> 37:46.256
You ready for a little trip?

37:47.875 --> 37:50.674
Just one night. I'll pick her
up again tomorrow afternoon.

37:50.792 --> 37:53.261
- I don't know, Ro.
- One night. That is all.

37:53.375 --> 37:56.458
- Why?
- I want to take Richard out.

37:56.583 --> 37:59.211
As a surprise and I don't want
him worrying about the dog.

37:59.333 --> 38:00.835
You know what he's like.

38:03.875 --> 38:06.845
- Why are you lying?
- What? I am not.

38:06.958 --> 38:09.131
Yes, you are lying.
Your knee is twitching.

38:09.250 --> 38:10.797
I have known you my entire life

38:10.917 --> 38:13.466
and you cannot tell a lie
without your knee twitching.

38:13.583 --> 38:15.677
What's going on? Ro!

38:15.792 --> 38:17.760
Look, will you take her or not?

38:17.875 --> 38:19.593
Yeah, alright,
I'll take her but...

38:19.708 --> 38:21.881
I gotta run.
I'll pick her up tomorrow.

38:25.875 --> 38:27.877
Run away?!
How did she run away?

38:28.000 --> 38:30.253
- I-I don't know, sweet...
- How did she get out?

38:30.375 --> 38:32.673
I-I came home and
the side gate was open.

38:32.792 --> 38:34.669
Why was the side gate open, Ro?

38:34.792 --> 38:36.590
- I don't know, sweetheart.
- Jesus!

38:36.708 --> 38:38.802
Oh, my God, you must be
feeling so emotional.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.760
Come on, baby, come here.
It's alright.

38:40.875 --> 38:42.377
I know how much
she meant to you.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.798
Meant to me?! Don't say
"meant"! "Means" to me!

38:44.917 --> 38:46.419
Call me if she shows up!

39:11.083 --> 39:13.882
- Miss Wickam, I beg of you!
- Mr Callum, hold your tongue.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.923
I'm to be wed within the week.

39:16.042 --> 39:17.544
You love him not.

39:17.667 --> 39:19.169
If you walk away from me now,

39:19.292 --> 39:21.636
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.252
I feel faint.

39:23.375 --> 39:26.094
I used to be scared
of the idea of growing old.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.710
Now I'm just scared of the idea

39:27.833 --> 39:29.551
of growing old without you.

39:31.458 --> 39:32.960
- Baby...
- Shh.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.085
What are you doing?
I was watching that.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.710
No, wait,
I need to talk to you.

39:39.833 --> 39:41.835
OK, talk to me but
can you turn the TV back on?

39:41.958 --> 39:43.926
- No, this is important.
- What is it?

39:45.458 --> 39:48.052
- I love you.
- How is that important?

39:48.167 --> 39:50.670
- Give me the remote.
- No, no, wait. Listen to me.

39:53.458 --> 39:57.884
I'm in this.
You and me, all the way.

39:59.458 --> 40:02.883
- Are you?
- Yeah, of course.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.673
<i>Are</i> you?

40:06.667 --> 40:09.716
I mean, what if... what if
we were to take things

40:09.833 --> 40:11.335
to the next level?

40:14.667 --> 40:17.090
Oh, we are so
on the same page, it's scary.

40:20.083 --> 40:21.676
Where are you going?

40:31.875 --> 40:33.673
Is this next level enough
for you?

40:33.792 --> 40:35.590
I need to tell you something.

40:35.708 --> 40:37.506
Wait, wait, wait,
let me enter into it.

40:37.625 --> 40:39.878
No, Dan, I'm not
doing this anymore, OK?

40:41.042 --> 40:43.465
You're giving me really mixed
messages here, Evie.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.176
I just want to tell you
something.

40:45.292 --> 40:47.841
Well, tell me, tell me!
Just stop playing games!

40:47.958 --> 40:52.088
- Tell me!
- Dan, I'm...

40:52.208 --> 40:53.926
(Doorbell rings)

40:54.042 --> 40:56.886
- No, leave it.
- Could be important.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.843
I can promise you
it is not as important

40:58.958 --> 41:00.505
as what I'm about to tell you.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.169
(Doorbell rings)

41:04.292 --> 41:06.511
I'm sorry, it's going to
annoy the shit out of me.

41:06.625 --> 41:08.468
- Don't you dare.
- Don't I dare?

41:08.583 --> 41:10.460
Calm down, I'll be two seconds.

41:10.583 --> 41:12.301
I'm asking you,

41:12.417 --> 41:16.092
your wife is asking you
to not answer the door.

41:24.083 --> 41:25.585
Yeah?

41:28.083 --> 41:30.677
- Bad time?
- Uh, I don't know, maybe.

41:30.792 --> 41:33.090
- Depends what you want.
- Good point.

41:33.208 --> 41:36.257
My name's Steve. I've just
moved in down the street.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.467
OK.

41:37.583 --> 41:39.301
Just wanted to introduce myself

41:39.417 --> 41:41.294
and say hi to the neighbours,
that's all.

41:41.417 --> 41:42.760
(Door slams)

41:42.875 --> 41:45.469
Uh, OK, yeah, in that case, it
is kind of a bad time, mate.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.256
- Sorry.
- Yeah, of course.

41:47.375 --> 41:49.218
I see you've
got your hands full.

41:49.333 --> 41:52.132
Uh, look, I just wanted
to give you these

41:52.250 --> 41:53.752
and I'll get out of your hair.

41:53.875 --> 41:55.593
Thanks.

41:58.458 --> 42:02.258
- They're Golliwogs.
- Yeah. Thanks.

42:03.333 --> 42:05.256
Bet you haven't seen those
for a while.

42:05.375 --> 42:06.877
Um, no. Suppose not.

42:07.000 --> 42:10.755
- Uh, is that it?
- Uh... yeah.

42:11.917 --> 42:13.590
Actually,
there is one more thing.

42:13.708 --> 42:14.925
Yep?

42:15.042 --> 42:16.965
I am required by federal law
to inform you

42:17.083 --> 42:18.835
that I am a convicted
sex offender.

42:20.667 --> 42:22.419
Yeah, that's fine.
Anything else?

42:23.667 --> 42:25.544
No. That's everything.

42:25.667 --> 42:27.294
OK!

42:30.667 --> 42:32.214
Evie!

42:33.667 --> 42:35.169
Evie, open the door.

42:36.458 --> 42:37.960
Evie, don't do this.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.630
Evie!

42:42.083 --> 42:45.087
Honey, what are you doing?
Go to sleep.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.677
No, I can't, I have to
finish these posters.

42:50.083 --> 42:51.926
D'you think you'll be able
to put them up

42:52.042 --> 42:53.544
around the streets tomorrow?

42:53.667 --> 42:55.385
- Yeah, of course, honey.
- Thanks.

42:55.500 --> 42:58.470
- I'm sorry.
- Baby, don't apologise.

42:58.583 --> 43:00.085
It's not your fault.

43:02.250 --> 43:05.675
I bet you anything that
when you get home tomorrow,

43:05.792 --> 43:07.544
Roxy'll be here
waiting for you.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.676
Run away?!

43:12.083 --> 43:15.087
W-What do you mean?
How is that even possible?

43:15.208 --> 43:18.087
Well, I think maybe she went
out the side gate

43:18.208 --> 43:19.710
'cause the latch is broken.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.803
- Why is the latch broken?
- It's a long story.

43:22.917 --> 43:25.090
I'm so sorry, Ro.
I-I didn't...

43:25.208 --> 43:27.677
OK, you can never tell Richard
about this. I mean it.

43:27.792 --> 43:28.884
What?

43:29.000 --> 43:30.968
You can never tell him
that Roxy was here.

43:31.083 --> 43:32.676
He will never forgive me.
Or you.

43:32.792 --> 43:34.294
- Ro...
- You gotta promise me.

43:34.417 --> 43:35.919
- Ro!
- No, promise me!

43:36.042 --> 43:37.760
I promise, what is going on?

43:39.083 --> 43:40.585
Oh, my God.

43:48.417 --> 43:50.590
- Did you find Roxy?
- Not yet.

43:50.708 --> 43:53.461
But we will. We will.

43:53.583 --> 43:55.802
Hmm, the posters should help,
don't you think?

43:57.083 --> 43:59.131
Definitely. Someone
will see those posters

43:59.250 --> 44:00.752
and they'll call.

44:00.875 --> 44:02.877
Yeah. So you put
all the posters up or...?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.502
- Of course.
- Of course.

44:04.625 --> 44:06.127
- Yeah.
- Hmm, that's weird.

44:06.250 --> 44:07.502
What?

44:07.625 --> 44:09.719
I was putting out the garbage
earlier today

44:09.833 --> 44:11.506
and the bottom of the bag
split open.

44:11.625 --> 44:13.252
- Oh.
- And I found these.

44:17.667 --> 44:19.169
What the fuck, Ro?

44:20.333 --> 44:22.427
- I must have accidentally...
- Oh, must you?

44:22.542 --> 44:24.419
That's bullshit
because you just told me

44:24.542 --> 44:26.044
that you put up
all the posters.

44:26.167 --> 44:27.669
Yeah, but what I meant was...

44:27.792 --> 44:29.294
- Where's Roxy?
- I don't know.

44:29.417 --> 44:31.010
Don't you?
Why are You lying to me?

44:31.125 --> 44:32.627
Why would you hurt me
like that?

44:32.750 --> 44:34.377
I mean, do you not
want to find Roxy?

44:34.500 --> 44:36.002
I did not hurt Roxy!

44:36.125 --> 44:38.093
Who said anything
about you hurting Roxy?

44:38.208 --> 44:40.085
- I didn't mean...
- What did you do to her?

44:40.208 --> 44:42.631
If it was an accident,
just tell me. I'll understand!

44:42.750 --> 44:44.878
- Did you kill her?
- What? No!

44:45.000 --> 44:46.752
I did not kill the dog!

44:46.875 --> 44:49.253
(Faint noise)

44:50.458 --> 44:51.960
Can we help you?

44:54.667 --> 44:56.465
I'll come back another time.

45:01.083 --> 45:03.085
Just tell me,
what has happened?

45:03.208 --> 45:04.630
Richard, I swear to you.

45:04.750 --> 45:06.502
The last time I saw Roxy,
she was fine.

45:06.625 --> 45:08.377
But there's something,
isn't there?

45:08.500 --> 45:10.002
I know you, Ro, I can see it.

45:13.250 --> 45:15.093
There's something wrong
with me.

45:15.208 --> 45:19.668
Um... I wanted to tell you
as soon as I felt it

45:19.792 --> 45:21.760
and I should have but I...

45:23.458 --> 45:25.460
I am sick, Richard.

45:25.583 --> 45:27.085
- I'm so sick.
- Sick?

45:27.208 --> 45:29.176
What do you mean, sick?
Sick, how?

45:29.292 --> 45:30.839
God, I'm so afraid to tell you.

45:30.958 --> 45:33.256
It's not...
It's not cancer, is it?

45:33.375 --> 45:36.003
- Baby, it's...
- It's not... cancer, is it?

45:44.875 --> 45:48.300
It could be...
a bit of cancer, yeah.

45:48.417 --> 45:49.760
Oh, God...

45:50.792 --> 45:52.669
What does that mean -
'could be'?

45:52.792 --> 45:55.136
Well, the doctor says
that the results are...

45:55.250 --> 45:56.752
They're inconclusive.

45:56.875 --> 45:58.673
Wait, wait, wait, I'm confused.

45:58.792 --> 46:01.261
It's OK, it's alright.
I've got you.

46:01.375 --> 46:03.878
- Hey, let it out.
- No, no, no. I've got you.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.254
- I'll be strong for you.
- Not too strong. Hey?

46:09.083 --> 46:11.461
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

46:11.583 --> 46:13.085

46:23.875 --> 46:25.877
Will you shut up?
The boys are asleep.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.253
Oh, I know,
I-I'm sorry I'm late.

46:28.375 --> 46:30.673
- I can explain...
- Stop fucking mumbling, Phil.

46:31.875 --> 46:34.674
'Not too late.' Do you
remember saying that?

46:34.792 --> 46:36.669
Yeah, I do remember
but I wanted to get...

46:36.792 --> 46:38.840
I don't care.

Hey, honey bee!

48:53.583 --> 48:55.881
I got a little surprise
for you today!

48:59.875 --> 49:01.377
Hello?

49:02.667 --> 49:04.340
What's with
the silent treatment?

49:06.083 --> 49:07.585
Oh, Evie, talk to me.

49:08.917 --> 49:10.840
Do you remember
what our counsellor said

49:10.958 --> 49:12.460
about communication?

49:12.583 --> 49:14.506
Yes, I remember
what our counsellor said

49:14.625 --> 49:15.877
about communication.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.002
I remember everything
our counsellor said

49:18.125 --> 49:20.924
including the date and time of
the next fucking appointment.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.544
Did you, Daniel? No.

49:22.667 --> 49:24.169
Don't call me Daniel, Evelyn.

49:24.292 --> 49:27.216
Daniel. Da-niel. Daniel,
Daniel, fucking Daniel.

49:27.333 --> 49:30.462
Honey bee, honey bee,
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

49:30.583 --> 49:32.881
I'm a shithead,
I completely forgot.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.254
- Won't happen again, alright?
- Yeah, well, better not.

49:38.875 --> 49:40.627
Got a present for you today.

49:42.333 --> 49:43.835
Really?

49:51.458 --> 49:54.667
- It's a video camera.
- It's for our role plays.

49:54.792 --> 49:56.794
I thought we could tape
and watch it back.

49:58.042 --> 49:59.544
- Dan.
- Don't you reckon?

49:59.667 --> 50:01.510
- How much was it?
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

50:01.625 --> 50:03.127
Couple of hundred bucks.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.048
We should really be saving
right now.

50:05.167 --> 50:07.169
No, no, we're fine.
Do you want to try it out?

50:07.292 --> 50:08.794
I have costumes

50:08.917 --> 50:11.215
and I've set up a little
something in the garage.

50:16.250 --> 50:18.252
Let me get the light

50:18.375 --> 50:22.380
and, uh, let me see,
press that there.

50:22.500 --> 50:26.676
Evie, you look amazing.
This is so exciting.

50:28.083 --> 50:29.630
- Uh, you ready?
- Yep.

50:30.875 --> 50:32.798
And... action.

50:34.458 --> 50:35.960
Action. (Clears throat)

50:36.083 --> 50:37.585
Um...

50:38.875 --> 50:41.253
I hear you've been
misbehaving, prisoner.

50:41.375 --> 50:43.093
(Clears throat)

50:44.125 --> 50:47.755
Um... I always fall
for the bad boys.

50:47.875 --> 50:50.674
What are you in here for, stud?

50:50.792 --> 50:54.467
Assault. Sexual assault.

50:54.583 --> 50:57.837
I'll bet she secretly loved it.

50:57.958 --> 50:59.460
He.

50:59.583 --> 51:02.257
- For fuck's sake, Dan!
- What?

51:02.375 --> 51:04.218
You're trying to turn me on
by telling me

51:04.333 --> 51:06.006
you have sexually assaulted
a man?!

51:06.125 --> 51:08.002
It's called having
a back story, Evie.

51:08.125 --> 51:10.378
(Beeping)
- Something's burning.

51:10.500 --> 51:13.674
Oh, shit. It's the light. Get
the door! Get the door, Evie!

51:13.792 --> 51:16.261
- I am!
- Bloody thing.

51:20.083 --> 51:22.131
We're fine! We're fine!
Everything's fine!

51:22.250 --> 51:24.673
Close the door, Evie! Close
the door! Close the door!

51:26.667 --> 51:28.465
(Coughs)

51:29.625 --> 51:31.878
No! Oh, fuck, Evie!

51:32.000 --> 51:33.877
This cost $3,000!

51:34.000 --> 51:36.253
Thank God it's working.
OK, let's go from the top.

51:36.375 --> 51:38.969
- The top of what?
- The scene.

51:39.083 --> 51:42.883
What scene? Dan, do you even
remember why we're doing this?

51:43.000 --> 51:45.219
- For the sex.
- For the marriage.

51:46.375 --> 51:48.878
You're really starting to
scare me. Look at yourself.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.877
Don't even recognise you
anymore.

51:52.083 --> 51:53.630
Babe, babe! Warden! Warden!

51:53.750 --> 51:56.003
Perhaps we can have
a bit of fun before you go.

52:28.125 --> 52:29.718
Hey.

52:31.125 --> 52:34.299
- Where have you been?
- What do you mean? Work.

52:34.417 --> 52:35.964
Well, I called your work

52:36.083 --> 52:38.006
and they said that
you left hours ago.

52:38.125 --> 52:41.550
- So where have you been?
- Just been in the car.

52:41.667 --> 52:43.260
Don't you dare fucking mumble.

52:43.375 --> 52:44.843
I've been in the car!

52:44.958 --> 52:47.381
Honestly, I've just been
driving around, thinking.

52:47.500 --> 52:49.002
Why weren't you at work?

52:49.125 --> 52:52.299
Maureen, there's been
a bit of a reshufﬂe at work.

52:52.417 --> 52:53.464
It's nothing I did.

52:53.583 --> 52:55.677
Are you cheating on me, Phil?

52:55.792 --> 52:57.294
What?

52:58.708 --> 53:02.508
$500 on women's clothes.
$70 at The Body Shop.

53:02.625 --> 53:04.878
- Interflora, David Jones...
- Show me that.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.502
Fuck you!

53:06.625 --> 53:09.708
We have a joint bank account,
you idiot.

53:09.833 --> 53:13.133
- I can explain.
- Yes. Yes, this time explain.

53:14.292 --> 53:17.842
I can... First of all,
I never did anything...

53:20.708 --> 53:22.301
It's so complicated...

53:23.917 --> 53:25.510
You're not going to understand.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.047
OK.

53:38.125 --> 53:39.752
Yeah, I've been having
an affair.

53:39.875 --> 53:41.377
(Gasps)

53:46.708 --> 53:49.712
It's over and
it will never happen again.

53:51.500 --> 53:54.128
- Who is she?
- Someone from work.

53:54.250 --> 53:56.924
- You don't know her.
- What's her name?

53:57.042 --> 53:59.716
- Does it matter?
- What is she like?

53:59.833 --> 54:02.086
- Don't do this.
- Is she younger than me?

54:02.208 --> 54:03.960
- She's about the same.
- Prettier?

54:04.083 --> 54:06.336
- Again, about the same.
- Is she thinner than me?

54:06.458 --> 54:07.960
You have a lot in common.

54:08.083 --> 54:10.586
She's not younger than me.
She's not skinnier than me.

54:10.708 --> 54:13.257
She's not prettier than me.
Why couldn't it just be me?

54:13.375 --> 54:14.877
Because she's softer than you.

54:16.500 --> 54:18.002
She's quieter than you.

54:19.292 --> 54:20.919
She doesn't yell at me.

54:21.042 --> 54:22.965
She doesn't call me an idiot

54:23.083 --> 54:25.506
or tell me to shut up
all the time.

54:28.292 --> 54:29.839
She listens to me.

54:31.292 --> 54:32.794
She's nice to me.

54:32.917 --> 54:35.545
She doesn't make me feel like
the only thing stopping her

54:35.667 --> 54:39.171
from being happy... is me.

54:42.125 --> 54:43.627
Get out.

54:44.917 --> 54:46.510
- Maureen.

57:26.125 --> 57:28.127
- Oh, what?
- No, I'm OK. I'm OK.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.469
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I promise you.

57:30.583 --> 57:32.506
Otherwise, we need to have
a little nap.

57:32.625 --> 57:35.299
A nap? In the car?
While I drive?

57:35.417 --> 57:36.919
Can you spare a dollar, mate?

57:37.042 --> 57:38.965
No, sorry, mate,
we don't have any.

57:39.083 --> 57:40.926
That's right, you remember it.

57:46.500 --> 57:48.127
Come on, man, just a dollar.

57:48.250 --> 57:50.719
Mate, we honestly don't
have anything. I'm sorry.

57:53.292 --> 57:54.919
Not one single dollar?

57:57.083 --> 57:59.177
OK, you should just give them
what you've got.

57:59.292 --> 58:01.090
- Alright.
- He doesn't have anything.

58:01.208 --> 58:03.085
- For fuck's sake.
- That's what he said.

58:03.208 --> 58:04.710
Alright, mate.

58:14.708 --> 58:16.585
- Alright, that's fine.
- OK.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.002
What?

58:22.000 --> 58:24.094
Alright, you want phones?
They're yours.

58:26.292 --> 58:27.794
There you go.

58:29.500 --> 58:31.923
Oh, come on, mate.
That's enough.

58:32.042 --> 58:33.715
You got what you wanted.

58:41.292 --> 58:42.794
I wouldn't say that.

58:46.125 --> 58:48.127
Aren't you
a pretty little thing?

58:48.250 --> 58:50.173
- Alright, fuck off.
- What are you doing?

58:50.292 --> 58:52.135
- (Screams) (Glass shatters)

58:59.125 --> 59:01.298
(Continues screaming)

59:31.292 --> 59:33.135
(Screams, sobs)

59:50.125 --> 59:52.503
Sorry, sir, there's been
a gas leak in the garage.

59:52.625 --> 59:55.128
- I can't let you through.
- A gas leak?

59:55.250 --> 59:56.376
Hmm.

59:56.500 --> 59:58.218
(Sobs)

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:08.590
Paul! Paul!

01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:11.917
Paul! Where are you...?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.127
Is he OK?

01:00:50.292 --> 01:00:51.669
Hey.

01:00:51.792 --> 01:00:54.136
Hey, sweetheart.

01:00:55.917 --> 01:00:59.717
- Where are we?
- We're in the hospital.

01:00:59.833 --> 01:01:02.916
- Shit, are you OK?
- Am I OK?

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:06.125
Yeah, I'm OK. You're not OK.

01:01:07.292 --> 01:01:09.010
You fractured your skull,
honey.

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.627
But you're going to be fine.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.423
Oh, my God. How?

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.965
You fell and hit your head.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.174
Really? I don't remember.

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:22.136
Yeah, the doctor said
you might not.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:25.049
- It's OK, just rest.
- What happened?

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:26.714
Somebody hit you.

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:31.419
The car park.

01:01:32.708 --> 01:01:34.210
Yeah. In the car park.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.093
Did I rape you?

01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:44.755
Shh.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:46.969
That's what I was trying
to do, sweetheart.

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.676
- Shh.
- Those men, I paid them.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.294
- I know.
- They were actors.

01:01:50.417 --> 01:01:52.636
They were meant to hit me
with a fake bottle.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.673
- Yeah.
- Did they use a real bottle?

01:01:54.792 --> 01:01:57.341
- I-I don't...
- It should have been fake.

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.506
Honey, just try and rest.
Just try and relax.

01:01:59.625 --> 01:02:01.252
- It was for your birthday.
- I know.

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:02.877
- As a surprise.
- I know.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.718
Did I do it?

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.753
Maeve, tell me.

01:02:11.917 --> 01:02:13.419
Did I rape you?

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.300
- Yeah. Baby, you raped me.
- Yeah?

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:22.966
(Signs) Was it OK?

01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:24.426
Yeah.

01:02:25.708 --> 01:02:27.210
Was it what you wanted?

01:02:29.125 --> 01:02:31.344
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:34.002
(Sighs)

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:37.594
I really tried to think
of everything this time.

01:02:37.708 --> 01:02:40.336
You know, I really put
some thought into it.

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:42.131
- I know.
- Yeah.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:43.752
I practised.

01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:46.003
But, you know, it was
my first rape and I...

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:50.504
I don't know if I'm, like,
meant to be a raper.

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.127
- Shh...
- 'Cause it was...

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:53.923
No, baby, it was perfect.

01:02:55.292 --> 01:02:56.794
It was perfect.

01:03:02.708 --> 01:03:04.301
Wait, so when
did I hit my head?

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:10.129
- Right after.
- Shit.

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.752
- There was more.
- No.

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:13.422
- There was more...
- No more, no.

01:03:13.542 --> 01:03:15.044
I was meant to do
one more thing.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.511
Pauly, no more, please.
Honey, no, that's enough.

01:03:17.625 --> 01:03:19.844
Just one more thing.
Where are my clothes?

01:03:19.958 --> 01:03:21.460
Please, just get my clothes.

01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:23.085
My jeans.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:25.006
The front pocket of my jeans.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:26.342
Yeah.

You're my priority!
Done! Sorted!

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:26.881
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.502
You never look at me anymore.

01:04:28.625 --> 01:04:30.343
You're late home every night...

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:32.176
I'm under the pump at work,
babe.

01:04:32.292 --> 01:04:33.794
That is bullshit. Bullshit!

01:04:33.917 --> 01:04:35.544
I called your brother
and he told me

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.385
you've been taking
theatre lessons.

01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.548
Theatre... Screen acting
classes. So what?

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.170
So what the fuck? Since when
did you want to be an actor'?

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.294
You're the one who said
I should get into it.

01:04:44.417 --> 01:04:45.919
- What? When?
- Oh, God!

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:48.295
When we first started
this whole role play thing.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.761
You said I could be
a famous actor. Your words.

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:53.879
That does not sound like
something I would say.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.502
And that is not the point.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.468
The point is you lied about it.

01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:59.085
I was embarrassed.

01:04:59.208 --> 01:05:03.509
I mean, Jesus, Evie!
Me? An actor?

01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:05.627
- It's crazy.
- It's ridiculous.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.252
It's not ridiculous.

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:10.504
Dan. It's ridiculous.

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:23.836
Don't go. Evie.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:27.127
Don't go.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.419
If you walk out that door,

01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:33.512
you'll be making the biggest
mistake of my life.

01:05:36.917 --> 01:05:39.716
I used to be scared
of the idea of growing old.

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:43.215
Now I'm just scared
of the idea...

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:46.840
...of growing old without you.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:07.344
- Ow. Fuck!
- What?

01:06:07.458 --> 01:06:09.506
Oh, I got it in my eye.
Christ!

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:11.298
- Got what in your eye?
- Tiger Balm.

01:06:11.417 --> 01:06:14.261
I got fucking Tiger Balm in my
eye. God, that really stings.

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:16.298
How did you get Tiger Balm
in your eye?

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:18.260
You're supposed to put it
near your eye.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:20.628
Like, the bridge of your nose
and it makes you cry.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:23.128
They showed us how to do it
in acting class this week.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.502
You were acting?

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.593
Yeah, you couldn't tell,
though, right?

01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:33.627
You are a psychopath.

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:39.709
You're not... you're not
even ready to be a husband,

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:41.335
let alone a...

01:06:42.917 --> 01:06:44.715
Let alone a what?

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:50.627
Evie.

01:06:52.125 --> 01:06:53.672
Let alone a what?

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:58.960
An actor?

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:01.586
You're not a fucking actor.

01:07:03.125 --> 01:07:04.718
Wow.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:16.585
What happened to you?
Where's Dan?

01:07:16.708 --> 01:07:19.382
"Where's Dan? Where's Dan?"
Fuck Dan!

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.093
Dan is boring. He's pathetic.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:23.131
Why do you keep going
on about Dan?

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.924
I can be better than Dan, Evie.

01:07:30.292 --> 01:07:31.885
I'm done with Dan.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:36.093
Yeah.

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:39.794
Me too.

01:07:51.792 --> 01:07:53.544
(Door opens)

01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.923
DOCTOR: OK, so I will see you
next time?

01:07:58.042 --> 01:07:59.544
Have a good day.

01:07:59.667 --> 01:08:01.385
Richard, come on in.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:04.880
(Sighs)

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.423
What's bothering you?

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:11.718
Um, well, I just wanted to
talk to you about Rowena.

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:20.502
- Where are you going?
- Uh, I don't know.

01:08:21.707 --> 01:08:24.301
I just can't be here right now.

01:08:24.417 --> 01:08:26.294
Why?

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.260
I saw Dr Barnes today.

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:31.379
She said she hasn't seen you
in weeks.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.834
- And you don't have cancer.
- I don't have cancer.

01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:37.131
What the fuck is going on?

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.843
Well, I just came
from the doctor

01:08:38.957 --> 01:08:41.506
and the results came back
and they are negative.

01:08:41.625 --> 01:08:43.377
I don't have cancer.
We beat it.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.046
No, it's bullshit.

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:47.169
Dr Barnes said she hasn't
seen you in weeks.

01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:49.010
I never said
I went to Dr Barnes.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.594
Yes, you did.
You said Dr Barnes.

01:08:51.707 --> 01:08:53.631
Well, honey, if I said that,
I'm sorry.

01:08:53.750 --> 01:08:55.877
I thought I had cancer,
I was a bit confused.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.546
But I don't...

01:08:58.707 --> 01:09:00.210
...have it.

01:09:07.917 --> 01:09:10.921
- So there's no cancer.
- No.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:14.127
(Cries)

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:17.210
Are you crying?

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.794
Aw...

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.594
- Sweetie, are you crying?
- Yes, I'm fucking crying!

01:09:24.707 --> 01:09:26.710
- Ow! That hurt!
- Oh, did it? Good!

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:28.335
I hurt you, good!

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:31.051
Because I can't help but feel
that for the last few weeks,

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.920
you've been hurting me. Like,
deliberately or something.

01:09:34.042 --> 01:09:36.511
- That is so crazy!
- Is it?

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:38.127
Then how come you keep putting

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.093
photos of my dad up
all around the house?

01:09:40.207 --> 01:09:42.336
I put a couple up,
I don't keep putting...

01:09:42.457 --> 01:09:44.426
But you do! This is
what I'm talking about!

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:46.636
You're not putting photos up,
except you are.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.252
Y-You didn't throw those
posters out, except you did.

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:51.719
But only because you have
cancer, except you don't!

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:53.335
I can't trust you anymore, Ro!

01:09:53.457 --> 01:09:56.132
I still don't know where
Roxy is. My dad's dead.

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:58.503
I'm crying
all the fucking time.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:01.048
I'm so dehydrated
and I can't help but feel

01:10:01.167 --> 01:10:03.295
that you are somehow...
you're behind it all!

01:10:03.417 --> 01:10:06.011
OK, firstly,
I did not kill your dad.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:12.508
(Chuckles) Boy, do I keep
picking the wrong times.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.627
So sorry.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.252
Richard, can you just...?

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:21.877
Wait, Richard!

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.628
Please, can you just stop
and talk to me?

01:10:27.125 --> 01:10:29.719
- Honey, please don't go.
- Why?

01:10:30.917 --> 01:10:33.090
Are you gonna actually tell me
what's going on?

01:10:33.208 --> 01:10:35.586
Like, look in my eyes and
actually tell me the truth?

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:40.252
No, of course not.

01:10:42.917 --> 01:10:45.136
All I ever wanted
was to have a family with you.

01:10:45.250 --> 01:10:47.002
And now...

01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:50.636
...shit, I'm almost glad
I couldn't get you pregnant.

01:10:55.917 --> 01:10:57.635
I am pregnant.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:08.627
What?

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.468
- Please come here.
- No, what did you say?

01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.628
Don't fuck with me, Ro,
not about this.

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.923
- What did you say?
- I said I'm pregnant.

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:23.798
Is that true?

01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:26.045
Are you sure?
How can you be sure?

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:27.669
Just, I am, I'm sure.

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.968
You're pregnant?

01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:34.006
That's what all this
has been about?

01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:36.127
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:39.839
Scared.

01:11:40.917 --> 01:11:42.419
We're gonna have a baby?

01:11:43.792 --> 01:11:45.294
We're gonna have a baby?

(Sexily) Hey, this is Sonya.
Who's this?

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:07.002
Hi, this is Monica
calling from...

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:10.129
You sound really cute, Monica.
I don't normally do girls

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:12.924
but I'm so horny tonight,
I'll make an exception.

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:17.752
No, no, sorry, no. No.
I'm calling from Video Relay.

01:15:17.875 --> 01:15:19.877
My name is Monica.
I have a caller on the line

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.628
that uses sign language and
I'll be interpreting the call

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:24.093
for both of you tonight.

01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:25.505
(Roughly) What?

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:28.128
If you talk to me, I will
sign to the caller who's deaf

01:15:28.250 --> 01:15:30.753
and he will sign back to me
and I will talk to you.

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.252
He's deaf?

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:34.002
Yes, that's right, he's deaf.

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.627
<i>So he can't hear me?</i>

01:15:35.750 --> 01:15:38.048
No, he can't hear anything,
he's... deaf.

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:41.137
<i>But he can see your hand signs
of everything I say?</i>

01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:43.127
Yes, sign language.
That's right.

01:15:43.250 --> 01:15:45.127
I know a couple of words
in sign language.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:48.333
I know "cunt face"
and "sunrise".

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:51.715
<i>Can he see me?
Like, what I'm doing?</i>

01:15:51.833 --> 01:15:54.256
No, nobody can see you.

01:15:54.375 --> 01:15:57.094
He can see me. You're just
on a regular phone.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:58.710
Right, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.

01:16:00.125 --> 01:16:02.127
- What does he look like?
- Um...

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:06.715
He's cute... I guess?

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.710
Look, can we just get started,
please?

01:16:08.833 --> 01:16:10.335
Sorry, what was his name again?

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:13.132
It'll be easier if you talk
to me as if I'm him.

01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:14.752
(Sexily) What's your name?

01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.503
- Sam.
- Fuck, that's slow.

01:16:20.625 --> 01:16:22.502
Yeah, sorry,
there's going to be a lag.

01:16:22.625 --> 01:16:26.380
What are you doing up so late,
Sam?

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:32.709
Just finishing some work. You?

01:16:32.833 --> 01:16:34.801
<i>I was waiting for you to call.</i>

01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:39.419
MONICA: What are you wearing?

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:42.716
Pink bra and panties.
What are you wearing?

01:16:44.708 --> 01:16:46.631
- Just boxer shorts.
- Is he?

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.627
No, he's wearing a hoodie...

01:16:52.667 --> 01:16:54.886
Why don't we take
those little shorts off?

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.718
Sorry, can you hang on
for one second?

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.127
Oh, shit.

01:17:23.125 --> 01:17:24.718
Am I still holding?
What the fuck?

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:26.460
Oh, my God, yes, I'm so sorry.
Um...

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.130
Can you repeat
what you said last?

01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:30.218
<i>I said, why don't
you take your shorts off?</i>

01:17:30.333 --> 01:17:31.550
<i>Fuckin' hell, man.</i>

01:17:32.542 --> 01:17:35.091
- Uh, his shorts are off.
- <i>Are you hard?</i>

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:36.710
Sorry, what do you mean
by that?

01:17:36.833 --> 01:17:38.631
Oh, fuck! It's hard to get
a run on here.

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.720
- Ask him is his dick's hard.
- Yeah, of course. Um...

01:17:48.125 --> 01:17:51.334
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
Sorry, yes, it is.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:55.292
(Sighs) You want to put your
big, hard cock in my mouth?

01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:58.500
Wow, can we just assume
he's gonna say yes to that?

01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:00.127
<i>Well, did he say yes?</i>

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:02.799
Uh, I reckon he will
so can we just imagine

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:04.919
he's popped it all in there
and wrap this up?

01:18:05.042 --> 01:18:09.502
- <i>Just fucking ask him, mate.</i>
- Wow. Killing me. Um...

01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.923
Wow. He said yes.
Huh! What a shock.

01:18:24.042 --> 01:18:26.716
What do you want me to do now,
lover?

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:36.344
Hello? What does he want me
to do now?

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:38.711
We're having a few technical
difficulties here.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:40.335
Can I just put you on hold
again?

01:18:40.458 --> 01:18:42.301
- <i>Yeah, yeah. Fuckin' hell.</i>
- Thank you.

01:19:44.917 --> 01:19:46.794
- Hello, you there?
- Yeah, are you there?

01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:49.090
<i>I mean, who's the guy?
What the fuck's going on?</i>

01:19:49.208 --> 01:19:50.881
Sorry, I'm just going to
backtrack.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.048
Earlier, he said,
please to spit on his penis

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:54.760
to make it all slippery.

01:19:54.875 --> 01:19:56.343
(Bell ringing)
- OK.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.960
Tell him I spat on it,

01:19:58.083 --> 01:20:00.427
there's spit everywhere,
it's as slippery as fuck.

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:01.668
What's the problem?

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:04.341
He wants to... Oh, my God.

01:20:04.458 --> 01:20:10.511
He wants to put his penis
in you... your vagina.

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:12.548
- Mm-hm.
- <i>Your wet vagina.</i>

01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:15.136
Mmm, oh, fuck, yeah.

01:20:15.250 --> 01:20:17.298
<i>Oh, I'm dripping wet.</i>

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:18.919
<i>Oh, that feels good.</i>

01:20:19.042 --> 01:20:21.545
I want your big, hard cock
to fill me up.

01:20:21.667 --> 01:20:23.169
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:20:23.292 --> 01:20:26.045
Oh, fuck. So deep, it hurts.

01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:27.919
You have to eat it, OK?

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:29.715
You can spit it out as much
as you want

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:31.380
but you still have to eat it.

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.844
<i>You're just gonna make
yourself dirty and sticky,</i>

01:20:33.958 --> 01:20:35.801
<i>Nanna, and then I have
to clean it up.</i>

01:20:35.917 --> 01:20:39.342
I'm... I'm so sorry, I'm lost.
What does he have to eat?

01:20:39.458 --> 01:20:42.132
Oh, shit! Don't tell him that.
I'm just talking to my nan.

01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:43.752
And don't tell him that either.

01:20:45.875 --> 01:20:47.718
Listen, can I...?
I gotta do something.

01:20:47.833 --> 01:20:49.710
Could you, um,
could you keep him talking

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:51.335
just for, like, one minute?

01:20:51.458 --> 01:20:52.960
- Definitely not.
- (Moans)

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:54.801
Can you hear that?
It's my nan, OK?

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:56.419
She's had a stroke.

01:20:56.542 --> 01:20:59.921
She's fucked.
I need these calls.

01:21:00.042 --> 01:21:02.921
I need the money.
Just for one minute.

01:21:03.042 --> 01:21:05.136
It's easier than it looks,
honestly.

01:21:05.250 --> 01:21:07.048
<i>Please?</i>

01:21:08.500 --> 01:21:10.002
- Fine.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:21:10.125 --> 01:21:12.002
OK, great. So just tell him
heaps of stuff

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:14.173
about how good his dick is
and how you want...

01:21:14.292 --> 01:21:15.794
(High-pitched hum)
- Oh, God.

01:21:15.917 --> 01:21:18.670
Hello? Hello?

01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:21.090
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:35.927
Would you like him
to fuck you hard or slow?

01:21:46.125 --> 01:21:47.798
Why would you ask
in the first place?

01:21:47.917 --> 01:21:49.794
He would like
to fuck you hard, actually.

01:22:31.333 --> 01:22:32.960
SONYA: <i>Hey, I'm back.</i>
- Oh, God!

01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:34.926
- Thank you, help me.
- Where are we at?

01:22:35.042 --> 01:22:36.794
<i>Uh, you are being fucked
from behind.</i>

01:22:36.917 --> 01:22:39.340
- Hard, in the arse, I think?
- Well, that was quick.

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:40.960
I know, that's what I said.

01:22:41.083 --> 01:22:44.007
OK, um, can you tell me
what to say next, please?

01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:46.674
Tell him it's the biggest dick
I've ever had.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.594
Um, and next?

01:22:53.708 --> 01:22:55.301
Does he want to put it
in my mouth?

01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:56.919
It's just been in your arse.

01:22:57.042 --> 01:22:58.544
So?

01:22:59.917 --> 01:23:01.419
OK.

01:23:06.917 --> 01:23:08.590
(Laughs)

01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:10.381
SONYA: <i>What?</i>

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.252
What's fucking funny?

01:23:16.375 --> 01:23:17.877
(Laughs)

01:23:19.125 --> 01:23:21.173
This is a fucking prank,
isn't it?
