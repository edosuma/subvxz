WEBVTT

00:08.408 --> 00:10.444
Jacqueline get to the roof.

00:13.347 --> 00:18.151
Onto us Van Helsings
and no one...

00:18.185 --> 00:20.487
I could always feel the darkness
in you.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.623
It's in you too.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.458
Fight it.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.027
Come...

00:27.060 --> 00:29.363
Bask in my glory.

00:29.396 --> 00:31.632
Fulfil your destiny.

00:31.665 --> 00:34.401
That's exactly what
I had in mind.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.743
This is for my sisters.

00:49.082 --> 00:52.286
You know how to open the portal
to the Dark Realm.

00:52.319 --> 00:55.289
I will keep my secret
to my death.

00:55.322 --> 00:57.991
I will not fail my children.

00:58.025 --> 01:01.461
Stillness is the way.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.296
Who's he?

01:02.329 --> 01:05.132
He's a complication,
maybe an ally.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.333
Not sure yet.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.435
This is our father.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.371
Mmmhmm, in his real form.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.173
I don't know how to use these.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.517
Gentlemen, my goodwill
only goes so far.

01:23.550 --> 01:26.687
I sent my men on a fool's errand
to get you all off that base

01:26.720 --> 01:28.088
and you promised me answers.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.156
We gave you answers.

01:29.189 --> 01:30.057
Really?

01:30.090 --> 01:31.358
Let's review, shall we?

01:31.391 --> 01:33.660
That kid over there
is really Hansen.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.362
But Avery isn't Avery.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.464
She's a shape shifting witch
named The Oracle‐

01:37.497 --> 01:38.599
Real name, Bathory.

01:38.632 --> 01:41.301
Hansen's kid, Violet, wants
to use three magic pages

01:41.335 --> 01:44.171
to open a portal to a place
called "The Dark Realm"

01:44.204 --> 01:47.608
so they can kill Dracula.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.742
Missing anything?

01:48.775 --> 01:50.344
No, that about covers it.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.612
I found all this shit hard
to buy myself‐

01:51.645 --> 01:52.713
Hard to buy?

01:52.746 --> 01:54.114
No.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.049
Impossible to buy.

01:56.083 --> 01:58.285
Because it's utter nonsense.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.421
Vampirism is a virus
and that girl is the cure

02:01.455 --> 02:03.323
and that's the beginning,
middle, and end of it.

02:03.357 --> 02:04.691
Look, we can explain
everything, I swear.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.193
Just give us a little bit
more time‐

02:06.226 --> 02:08.795
No! You stalled me once.

02:08.829 --> 02:09.763
I'm not gonna let it
happen again.

02:09.796 --> 02:12.866
One way or another you
all are coming with me.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.067
You're a stubborn
son of a bitch,

02:14.101 --> 02:15.035
you know that, Nicholson?

02:15.068 --> 02:17.704
Enough time passes,
my men conduct a search,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.773
they find us down here.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.242
How do you think that ends
for you?

02:22.275 --> 02:23.377
Badly.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.712
But it doesn't have
to go that way.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.748
What the hell is that?

02:36.590 --> 02:41.294
That is proof.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.563
When was the last time
you saw Avery, Colonel?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.398
A few hours ago.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.766
Why?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.804
Does she look newly dead
to you?

03:10.290 --> 03:13.126
[clock chimes]

03:14.194 --> 03:19.833
An eternity comes to an end
in the blink of an eye.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.838
[evil laugh]

03:24.871 --> 03:29.876
[chiming continues]

03:29.910 --> 03:39.886
[evil laughter]

03:45.358 --> 03:46.626
How's he doing?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.161
Weak.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.730
In and out of consciousness.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.965
The Oracle really messed him up.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.934
Did he tell you anything?

03:56.369 --> 03:59.706
We can't use these pages
until we have more information.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.175
There's supposed to be a weapon
that kills the Dark One.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.544
But it might be in the Dark
Realm somewhere.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.313
Vanessa could help.

04:06.346 --> 04:07.714
We can't give up on her.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.416
She trapped herself
in there for us.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.618
Okay guys, we got a bigger
problem on our hands.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.720
It's just a matter of time
till the Oracle figures out

04:13.754 --> 04:15.655
you snatched your dad.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.324
What do you think happens then?

04:17.357 --> 04:18.191
My men and I could‐

04:18.225 --> 04:19.693
Could what?

04:19.726 --> 04:21.194
Detain her?

04:21.228 --> 04:22.129
Kill her?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.197
You'd all be dead
the second you tried.

04:24.231 --> 04:26.700
Mira and my other sisters
are guarding us outside.

04:26.733 --> 04:29.202
We'll just go after her.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.203
We got lucky.

04:30.237 --> 04:33.507
We surprised Michaela
at her weakest moment.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.510
I don't think the Oracle's
gonna go down that easy.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.213
Then what do we do?

04:42.449 --> 04:44.684
These pages are instructions.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.888
Maybe all the answers we need
are right here.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.857
Am I the only one staring
at three blank pages?

04:50.891 --> 04:53.226
[laughs]

05:00.934 --> 05:04.938
My sister and I,
we need a minute.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.408
Hey.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.478
I'm gonna join my sisters
on the front line.

05:11.511 --> 05:13.346
Good luck.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.957
What was that about?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.792
It's not the time.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.966
Oh, my god.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.667
It's working.

06:11.471 --> 06:13.473
Wait.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.042
What language is that?

06:16.076 --> 06:18.712
I failed Spanish three times.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.647
It looks ancient.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.416
Why would they
write it like this?

06:25.352 --> 06:28.622
There's only one person
who would know.

06:34.527 --> 06:35.962
I need your blood.

06:38.031 --> 06:38.865
You what?

06:38.899 --> 06:39.866
For my dad.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.335
He's too weak to feed
and the clock's ticking.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.336
What are you gonna do?

06:43.370 --> 06:46.706
Jump start him, like
a shot of adrenaline.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.042
I hope.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.977
Roll up your sleeve.

06:51.011 --> 06:51.912
[chuckles]
Not a chance.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.146
No, no.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.482
That‐ that's worth a try.

06:55.515 --> 06:58.418
You're the only one that
doesn't have tainted blood.

06:58.451 --> 07:00.353
Tainted blood?

07:00.387 --> 07:01.821
Everyone else here is either
a Van Helsing

07:01.855 --> 07:05.825
or used to be a vampire.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.094
He needs pure human blood.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.029
Wha‐

07:11.398 --> 07:15.702
Why do I feel like I've run off
and joined the goddamned circus?

07:31.751 --> 07:34.421
His breathing is getting slower.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.022
Then we've gotta do this.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.427
Look, are you sure?

07:49.169 --> 07:52.038
Wait, what if that kills him?

07:52.072 --> 07:54.874
Not doing anything is gonna kill
all of us.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.945
Shit.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.781
This isn't working!

08:34.814 --> 08:35.949
Shit!

08:36.850 --> 08:37.617
[gasps]

08:37.650 --> 08:38.685
Dad?

08:38.718 --> 08:39.919
Dad, can you hear me?

08:39.953 --> 08:40.920
Hey, it's all right!

08:40.954 --> 08:41.855
Hey.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.056
Dad!

08:43.089 --> 08:44.991
Can you hear me?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.459
Can you hear me?

08:46.493 --> 08:48.194
Hey, look at me!

08:48.228 --> 08:50.563
We need your help
with the pages.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.465
It's okay.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.400
It's okay.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.167
We unlocked them
with our blood,

08:54.200 --> 08:55.402
but we can't read them.

08:55.435 --> 08:59.606
We need you to tell us what
to do before Bathory finds us.

08:59.639 --> 09:00.540
The weapon.

09:00.573 --> 09:01.941
Is it in...

09:04.177 --> 09:05.512
Dad?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.014
Dad?

09:13.219 --> 09:14.954
It's okay.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.201
Why are we here?

09:28.234 --> 09:31.671
Something he wants us to see.

09:31.704 --> 09:35.608
This has to be a vision
or a memory maybe?

09:44.284 --> 09:45.985
Dad?

09:49.856 --> 09:51.691
He can't see us.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.195
Who is there?

09:56.129 --> 09:57.564
It is I, ma'am.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.765
Willem.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.234
Oh, thank goodness
you're alive.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.204
I feared that we had lost
you, too.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.876
I begged him not to go through
with that accursed ritual.

10:09.909 --> 10:14.080
After the tragedy with Jacob
he just felt he must.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.916
And now look at what has
befallen us.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.220
One brother is locked away
and the other may never return.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.023
Come closer, dear Willem.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.559
I need your help
to devise a plan.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.895
There must be a means
to rescue him from...

10:30.897 --> 10:33.199
You!

10:33.233 --> 10:34.901
You are one of them.

10:34.934 --> 10:35.969
Please, ma'am.

10:36.002 --> 10:39.305
You are the reason my family
has been betrayed,

10:39.339 --> 10:40.740
and they're now adrift.

10:40.773 --> 10:41.808
Kill me if you must

10:41.841 --> 10:43.910
but there are things you can
only learn from me.

10:43.943 --> 10:50.049
They trusted you, and you
played a role in their downfall.

10:50.083 --> 10:53.253
You have ruined us!

10:53.286 --> 10:56.289
I did, it's true.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.894
But I can still help
your cause.

11:00.927 --> 11:03.329
I swear it.

11:03.363 --> 11:07.133
After all the evil
that you have done?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.102
What good could you
possibly do?

11:09.135 --> 11:12.805
Destroy them from within.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.208
Kill the Dark One forever.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.016
That was the moment.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.986
The moment he vowed to fight
back against them.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.690
That's what he's trying
to show us.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.759
But it doesn't help
with the pages.

11:32.792 --> 11:37.330
Or knowing what the weapon is,
or where to find it.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.933
It has to have meaning.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.236
It does.

11:44.971 --> 11:48.841
For you to understand the weapon
you first need to know why

11:48.875 --> 11:51.978
and how I came to create it.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.181
The truth will not be easy
to accept.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.342
The painting.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.576
Ah.

12:23.610 --> 12:27.113
Despite their instincts, what
was left of Abraham's family

12:27.146 --> 12:29.249
regained their trust in me,

12:29.282 --> 12:31.050
allowing me to keep things
that they thought

12:31.084 --> 12:33.353
held only sentimental value.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.122
They didn't know the pages
were behind the painting.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.223
You lied to them.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.224
I kept my promise.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.027
To help the cause and
to protect the knowledge

12:41.060 --> 12:44.397
of how to liberate the Dark One
from the other brides.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.532
Even if that meant keeping it
from the Van Helsings.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.533
Why?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.869
Well, they had no idea
how to build a weapon

12:49.902 --> 12:52.138
and without that the pages
were nothing more than

12:52.171 --> 12:53.539
a dangerous weakness.

12:53.573 --> 12:57.477
So you were working on that,
but what about the other brides?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.246
I created enough doubt in
Bathory's mind about Michaela

13:00.280 --> 13:04.083
and her jealousy that
she had her locked away.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.418
And the Sisterhood, too.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.119
Hmm.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.288
One less enemy to fool.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.490
So you were playing both sides
of the line.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.425
I performed my part
for the Oracle.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.561
I told her I was researching
ways how to strengthen

13:15.595 --> 13:20.867
vampire kind so the Beloved
would have an army.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.277
[growling and snarling]

13:37.984 --> 13:41.120
In truth, I was searching only
for a weapon

13:41.154 --> 13:42.989
that would kill her.

13:44.490 --> 13:48.261
At first I sought
a chemical solution.

13:48.294 --> 13:52.131
[screaming]

13:52.165 --> 13:53.232
So you tortured them.

13:53.266 --> 13:57.136
I'm not proud about what I put
my subjects through.

13:57.170 --> 14:02.475
Like me, they had
once been... human.

14:02.508 --> 14:06.179
Pain was still... pain.

14:07.213 --> 14:11.017
[struggling grunts]

14:11.050 --> 14:13.853
But I had to make things right
no matter the cost

14:16.356 --> 14:22.362
to redeem my betrayal
with the Van Helsings.

14:28.534 --> 14:34.073
For decades, centuries, the
world carried on around me.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.577
I needed to take a new form to
secure the position I required.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.113
For what?

14:41.080 --> 14:45.118
So that I could discover
the terrible world of eugenics.

14:55.261 --> 15:00.433
I had the pages but failed for
so long to create the weapon.

15:00.466 --> 15:03.035
I knew the Third Reich
had the means.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.005
This... this is too much.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.907
Bag it up.

15:07.940 --> 15:09.242
All of it.

15:09.275 --> 15:12.011
I want it shipped
to my lab stateside.

15:12.044 --> 15:13.613
And boys?

15:13.646 --> 15:15.548
This never happened.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.417
Are we clear?

15:18.751 --> 15:21.921
Cross‐breeding,
DNA manipulation.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.924
Their evil paved a certain
sinister path

15:24.957 --> 15:27.226
that I reluctantly followed.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.694
I've had enough.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.596
Wake me up from this shit.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.564
Vi.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.065
This‐

15:33.099 --> 15:34.567
This is a nightmare.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.570
No more riddles.

15:37.603 --> 15:41.174
What is the weapon?

15:43.643 --> 15:47.180
You both need to see
for yourselves.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.386
I took what I discovered in
that bunker and years later

15:53.419 --> 15:59.158
I founded Blak Tek so I could
finally make the weapon.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.129
This is where we're from,
isn't it?

16:03.162 --> 16:07.200
Where you made us.

16:11.437 --> 16:14.474
You see where this is going,
don't you?

16:17.043 --> 16:19.545
I don't know if I can, Jack.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
We have to.

16:41.234 --> 16:46.038
You made us to sacrifice
to the vampires.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.374
To bring back the Dark One.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.509
That's the truth.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.611
No.

16:51.644 --> 16:56.482
I didn't make you to sacrifice
for the Dark One.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.354
I made you to destroy
the Dark One.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.190
You two are the weapon.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.226
The next step in what Vanessa
and Scarlett were.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.030
A hybridization of the very
best of humanity.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.065
The Van Helsings.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.200
An antidote to the Dark One,

17:14.233 --> 17:17.637
using her own blood weaponized
in you.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.072
One bite could destroy
her forever.

17:20.106 --> 17:23.242
Why didn't you tell us
that before now?

17:23.276 --> 17:26.812
I wanted to.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.615
But something happened along
the way.

17:30.516 --> 17:36.088
Once created, you went from
weapon I needed

17:36.122 --> 17:38.190
to children I love.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.159
And as years went by
and you grew I wondered

17:40.192 --> 17:43.162
if any of this would be
necessary at all.

17:43.195 --> 17:45.665
The Dark One was locked away,
the pages were protected.

17:45.698 --> 17:49.402
I just wanted you to have happy
normal lives

17:49.435 --> 17:53.573
and keep you safe
from the evil of the world.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.175
And then everything changed.

17:58.110 --> 18:05.251
The day of the rising you sent
that vampire to protect me,

18:05.284 --> 18:06.852
didn't you?

18:09.755 --> 18:13.225
I tried to save you.

18:13.259 --> 18:14.594
I failed.

18:19.332 --> 18:24.170
I knew that day safety
would be gone.

18:24.203 --> 18:26.739
That the Oracle in a world
overrun with vampires

18:26.772 --> 18:31.544
might find her own pathway
to the Dark One.

18:31.577 --> 18:36.115
And that one day,
whether I liked it or not,

18:36.148 --> 18:38.784
you two would be needed.

18:41.954 --> 18:46.492
Doing all of this, fighting
back against the darkness,

18:46.525 --> 18:49.128
loving us despite
why you made us,

18:49.161 --> 18:51.564
it doesn't make up for
the things you've done.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.133
The people you've killed.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.469
Like Avery.

18:56.502 --> 18:58.237
You have every right
to judge me.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.406
I've earned that.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.608
But in you, through both of you,

19:02.642 --> 19:08.681
we can fight back together
if you choose to.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.750
If we choose to.

19:12.351 --> 19:17.790
Look, I can't ask you to face
the Dark One.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.792
I can't make you fulfil
the promises I made

19:19.825 --> 19:21.761
to the Van Helsings.

19:21.794 --> 19:27.299
But with all that's at stake
the decision has to be yours.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.472
Facing the dark,
making the right choices

19:33.506 --> 19:39.779
in the face of evil,
that's what Vanessa did.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.814
It's what Dad's done.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.652
It's what we have to do.

19:54.727 --> 19:57.963
[gasps]

20:00.499 --> 20:04.637
I helped create them.

20:04.670 --> 20:08.374
But it all should be clear
to you.

20:16.415 --> 20:19.351
The words.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.453
I understand them now.

20:20.486 --> 20:25.257
The first two pages opens
the portal from our end.

20:25.291 --> 20:28.828
The last one opens it
from the other side again.

20:39.705 --> 20:44.343
You have to keep that
and yourself safe until...

20:46.746 --> 20:48.714
Until when?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.616
Midnight.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.018
When the moon shines
on the pentagram.

20:53.052 --> 20:56.589
I drew it on the floor
of the gymnasium.

20:56.622 --> 20:59.592
But that means we'd have to go
back into the base.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.996
And face the Oracle.

21:15.674 --> 21:18.077
Midnight, huh?

21:18.110 --> 21:20.346
Goddamn magic.

21:20.379 --> 21:23.983
The question now is what do
we do about Bathory?

21:24.016 --> 21:25.985
We have to take her
out of the equation.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.686
Do you have a plan?

21:27.720 --> 21:29.455
We do.

21:29.488 --> 21:35.361
But in order for it to work...
first I'm going to have to feed.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.003
Oh, you gotta be รก
kidding me!

21:44.036 --> 21:45.070
Again?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.840
[knocking]

21:47.873 --> 21:49.809
Enter.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.656
Colonel.

22:03.689 --> 22:06.058
I'm relieved to see you
back with us.

22:06.091 --> 22:09.461
Your men and I
were quite worried.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.530
I was captured.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.667
Briefly managed to escape.

22:14.700 --> 22:20.039
Most of the wanted list slipped
through but not a total loss.

22:20.072 --> 22:24.176
My men captured Hansen.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.012
The president will be relieved.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.148
Hansen must be punished
for what he's done.

22:29.181 --> 22:32.718
The secrets he's kept.

22:32.751 --> 22:37.156
Have your men extracted
any information from him?

22:37.189 --> 22:40.492
He's proving surprisingly
resistant.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.728
That's disappointing.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.564
I was hoping he'd give you
everything you need

22:45.598 --> 22:47.066
on the people in those photos.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.568
Perhaps with your access
to Blak Tek

22:49.602 --> 22:54.573
you could provide a more
experimental path to the truth.

22:54.607 --> 22:57.443
Of course.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.678
I'd love to get started
right away.

22:59.712 --> 23:02.047
My superiors are expecting
a report.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.550
I'd be happy to.

23:06.452 --> 23:08.854
I would hate to keep
them waiting.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.597
Where are your men?

23:18.631 --> 23:21.934
I sent every available soldier
on the hunt for Hansen's girls.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.103
Was that really necessary?

23:24.136 --> 23:26.105
You didn't see the video I saw.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.173
They're extremely dangerous.

23:30.509 --> 23:32.544
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.916
You're sweating.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.956
I'm fine.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.492
It must have been terrifying,

23:46.525 --> 23:49.795
being captured and brought
before a traitor like Hansen.

23:49.828 --> 23:51.797
He's nothing to fear.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.866
He is just a man, after all.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.638
Indeed.

23:59.672 --> 24:02.274
He'll pay for his betrayal.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.909
We'll see to it.

24:03.943 --> 24:05.044
Together.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.253
Wait.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.121
No unnecessary risks.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.156
Go.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.166
He took a big chance coming
in here as the Colonel.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.334
It was a good plan.

24:28.367 --> 24:29.835
Let's hope it works.

24:29.868 --> 24:32.104
And if it doesn't?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.906
It will.

24:35.007 --> 24:38.177
Things might get messy
in the Dark Realm.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.646
I'm giving you
the third page.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.614
It's our only ticket home.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.850
Why me?

24:44.883 --> 24:46.685
Just a feeling.

24:46.719 --> 24:50.823
Besides, you're the person
I trust most in this world.

24:50.856 --> 24:53.192
We're in this together.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.363
Once he's taken care of
everything he's given us,

24:57.396 --> 25:00.099
helped us turn the tide
against the vampires.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.839
What're we doing here?

25:06.872 --> 25:10.075
We got one piece
of intel from him.

25:10.109 --> 25:13.679
He said everything
we need to know,

25:13.712 --> 25:18.050
all the answers,
are in this room.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.952
Whatever that means.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.799
After you.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.569
He's a mad man.

25:37.603 --> 25:39.238
And you're a US Army Colonel.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.673
Shouldn't you protect me?

25:41.707 --> 25:44.243
Why isn't she going in?

25:44.276 --> 25:45.844
I don't know.
Something's wrong.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.079
Of course.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.981
Where are my manners?

25:52.951 --> 25:55.187
He's going in with her?

25:55.220 --> 25:56.755
That's not part of the plan.

25:56.789 --> 25:57.756
Screw the plan.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.758
I'm certain that this might be
our only chance.

26:10.936 --> 26:12.938
I sure hope he knows
what he's doing.

26:12.971 --> 26:17.943
Here we are again.

26:17.976 --> 26:18.911
Well played.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.083
I couldn't risk you interfering.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.285
That's amusing.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.353
I was gonna say the same
of you.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.169
Manipulating me

26:44.203 --> 26:47.272
on your wretched behalf.

26:47.306 --> 26:51.477
You wanted her gone just as much
as I did and now she is.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.479
Permanently.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.948
At least you got that small win.

26:55.981 --> 27:01.453
In your hour of victory
you're nothing but a failure.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.155
All of you!

27:04.022 --> 27:07.793
I will not be defeated.

27:07.826 --> 27:11.263
And neither will my Beloved.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.032
Axel, we have to do something.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.734
We can't just leave him
in there.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.302
We can't let her out, either.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.304
Oh, Bathory.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.307
You think so little of me.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.511
I've had you trapped inside this
room just like you trapped me

27:25.544 --> 27:27.880
and there is no escape
from within.

27:27.913 --> 27:31.483
You are a fool.

27:31.517 --> 27:34.019
A prisoner of your
own ignorance.

27:34.052 --> 27:37.222
Even if I die in here
with you

27:37.256 --> 27:40.225
that's a price
I'm willing to pay,

27:40.259 --> 27:43.061
because no one will ever
open this room.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.530
No one?

27:44.563 --> 27:48.867
Your magic cannot penetrate
these walls.

27:48.901 --> 27:55.507
Yes, but from within I'm still
as powerful as ever.

27:58.110 --> 28:00.145
Shit, shit, shit.
This isn't good.

28:00.179 --> 28:01.079
We gotta get Jack and Violet.

28:01.113 --> 28:02.481
Come on. Let's go.

28:05.083 --> 28:08.320
My daughters will kill
the Dark One.

28:08.353 --> 28:12.191
They have the means to open
the portal.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.492
[choking]

28:13.525 --> 28:16.261
And you think I didn't know?

28:16.295 --> 28:20.199
Oh, sweet Willem,
stillness was the key.

28:20.232 --> 28:25.437
Stillness lead to everything
falling right into place.

28:25.470 --> 28:29.908
I am exactly where
I want to be.

28:29.942 --> 28:32.611
[groaning]

28:32.644 --> 28:34.213
Your daughters will open
the portal

28:34.246 --> 28:36.949
but that's as much
as they can do.

28:36.982 --> 28:40.052
My Beloved will destroy them

28:40.085 --> 28:44.556
and then she will return for me
bathed in their blood.

28:51.597 --> 28:54.866
You've served your purpose,
Willem.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.069
Now it is time for you to die.

29:02.074 --> 29:09.114
[screaming]

29:20.125 --> 29:21.293
It's Julius.

29:27.532 --> 29:28.500
What's wrong?

29:28.533 --> 29:30.102
The plan went sideways.

29:30.135 --> 29:30.902
How?

29:30.969 --> 29:31.937
She knew.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.338
Somehow she saw it coming.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.541
He's locked in that room
with her.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.653
[groaning]

29:47.686 --> 29:50.989
Get your hands off him,
you crusty bitch!

29:51.223 --> 29:51.957
No, no.

29:51.990 --> 29:52.257
No! Vi!

29:52.291 --> 29:53.191
Vi, no!

29:53.225 --> 29:53.925
No!

29:53.959 --> 29:54.359
No!

29:54.393 --> 29:55.427
No. Get off me!

29:55.460 --> 29:56.094
Violet, we can't open the door,
you know we can't.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.929
I have to save him!

29:57.963 --> 30:00.332
What a touching family reunion.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.675
Julius, let me go!

30:12.144 --> 30:12.544
Let me go!

30:12.577 --> 30:13.612
Jack!

30:13.645 --> 30:14.346
Vi!

30:14.379 --> 30:15.113
Don't go‐

30:15.147 --> 30:17.349
[groaning in pain]

30:17.382 --> 30:22.287
No more sweet Willem, you've
said and done far too much.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.489
It's time for fate to run
its course.

30:26.591 --> 30:27.959
[snap]

30:33.598 --> 30:36.268
[sobbing]
No!!!!!!

30:42.441 --> 30:44.042
Dad!

30:44.076 --> 30:46.345
[sobbing]

30:46.378 --> 30:48.380
I could have stopped her.

30:48.413 --> 30:50.182
I could have saved him.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.017
I'm so sorry, Vi.

31:01.460 --> 31:04.262
You're gonna pay for this.

31:04.296 --> 31:07.432
We're gonna find your Beloved
and we're gonna finish her!

31:07.466 --> 31:10.335
You hear me?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.504
Then I'm coming back for you.

31:12.537 --> 31:16.174
The blood of the Dark One
fills your veins.

31:16.208 --> 31:20.011
Accept it for the gift it is.

31:20.045 --> 31:22.180
Vi, we've gotta stick
to the plan, okay?

31:22.214 --> 31:23.048
All right?

31:23.081 --> 31:23.615
It's the only way.

31:23.648 --> 31:24.616
I want her dead!

31:24.649 --> 31:25.550
No. Vi.

31:25.584 --> 31:26.351
Vi, look at me.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.185
Look at me, Vi!

31:27.219 --> 31:28.520
Hey!

31:28.553 --> 31:29.588
We'll get 'em.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.156
We'll get all of 'em.

31:37.162 --> 31:38.029
Jack.

31:39.464 --> 31:40.766
Jack.

32:14.866 --> 32:20.672
Brave for you to be so close
to me alone.

32:20.705 --> 32:24.910
Your little spells don't work
through these walls.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.945
It's why Hansen led you
in there.

32:26.978 --> 32:30.482
A spider caught
in your own web.

32:30.515 --> 32:33.785
I just wanna take one
last look at you.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.691
Why is that?

32:39.724 --> 32:44.596
So that I can imagine all
the ways I'd like to kill you.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.800
Make you suffer.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.635
Maybe one day I'll get
to do that.

32:50.669 --> 32:57.042
You've changed
since we last met, Axel.

32:57.075 --> 33:01.947
Even through these walls I can
sense the depth of your pain.

33:01.980 --> 33:06.117
The loss.

33:06.151 --> 33:11.323
You loved her,
didn't you?

33:11.356 --> 33:14.860
With all your heart.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.728
Scarlett.

33:16.761 --> 33:18.396
Don't you say her name.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.399
It's why you came back here,
isn't it?

33:21.433 --> 33:27.506
You wish somehow you could have
her back.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.810
You know, I can be anyone.

33:31.843 --> 33:36.515
I could be her for you.

33:36.548 --> 33:42.654
Give you the chance to feel
her touch upon your skin.

33:42.687 --> 33:47.659
Embrace that yearning
that is growing inside of you.

33:47.692 --> 33:48.793
Now is your chance.

33:48.827 --> 33:55.467
Open that door and take me
in whichever way you wish.

34:01.039 --> 34:07.512
I want to stay with you,
Axel.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.881
I love you, Axel.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.689
Through me, prove your love
for Scarlett.

34:22.327 --> 34:25.864
I am proving my love for her.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.434
Right now.

34:29.467 --> 34:33.572
Everything that happened,
her sacrifice,

34:33.605 --> 34:38.710
it all lead to this moment.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.545
Those Van Helsings
are gonna go in there

34:40.579 --> 34:43.081
and they're gonna kill
your Dark One.

34:43.114 --> 34:46.117
And I'm gonna be right here
watching the look on your face

34:46.151 --> 34:50.589
while you feel her
take her last breath.

34:52.624 --> 34:57.228
Your dark future is looming,
inevitable as death itself.

34:57.262 --> 35:01.900
And it will liberate me.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.904
You're never gonna leave
this room alive.

35:05.937 --> 35:09.174
My Beloved will know
where to find me.

35:09.207 --> 35:14.245
She will walk right past all of
you and open that door herself.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.414
You'll see.

35:20.885 --> 35:25.957
[laughs]

35:25.991 --> 35:29.027
[laughing continues]

35:29.060 --> 35:31.096
I love you Axel.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.522
What is it?

36:01.860 --> 36:03.728
Are you sure we're on
the right track here?

36:03.762 --> 36:06.297
Are you seriously doing
this now?

36:06.331 --> 36:11.036
My dad died so we can end
the darkness once and for all.

36:11.069 --> 36:16.641
That Oracle bitch,
something's off.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.144
It's like she's got an ace
up her sleeve.

36:19.177 --> 36:24.983
You went back and talked to her,
didn't you?

36:25.016 --> 36:26.818
Maybe we should just hold off
till we're sure.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.886
No.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.888
She's gonna get out of
that cell sooner or later.

36:29.921 --> 36:34.159
This is our best chance
to end it all.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.027
I don't have time for doubt.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.255
Oh, shit!

37:12.163 --> 37:16.701
I offer my life to all those
who lost theirs.

37:16.735 --> 37:21.039
The Dark One ends tonight
and forever.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.355
It's almost time.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.458
Come back in one piece.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.360
We're all counting on you.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.363
Hey.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.971
You know, it's okay
to be scared.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.707
It feels bigger than that.

37:56.341 --> 37:59.711
Well, I believe in you, Jack.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.851
The last person
that told me that,

38:06.885 --> 38:08.987
I lost her.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.990
I don't wanna feel that again.

38:12.791 --> 38:18.696
Well, is it worse to feel or
to stop yourself from feeling?

38:18.730 --> 38:21.900
I mean, that's what makes us
better than them.

38:26.538 --> 38:30.441
I hope you're here
when I get back.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.544
I promise.

38:32.577 --> 38:35.079
With all my heart.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.709
It's time.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.780
If something goes wrong
in there,

39:08.813 --> 39:10.148
use the last page and get back.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.216
You hear?

39:11.249 --> 39:12.450
We will.

39:12.483 --> 39:13.985
Bite the Dark One.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.754
Save Vanessa.

39:34.873 --> 39:41.646
[speaking ancient language]

39:45.183 --> 39:49.988
[speaking ancient language]

39:53.892 --> 39:55.793
[speaking ancient language]

40:05.203 --> 40:06.938
That's incredible.

40:09.173 --> 40:10.775
Ready?

40:22.587 --> 40:26.791
That is unlike anything I could
have ever imagined.

40:26.824 --> 40:29.527
And now for the hard part.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.162
What's the hard part?

40:31.195 --> 40:33.164
We wait.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.832
How long do we wait?

40:34.866 --> 40:36.968
As long as it takes.

40:50.214 --> 40:52.350
Hey.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.252
The darkness that they face
is ancient.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.655
It's twisted.

40:57.689 --> 41:01.859
I hope they know
what they're doing.

41:01.893 --> 41:09.867
You, me, Axel, we all spent time
in that shadow.

41:09.901 --> 41:12.971
All we got now is hope.

41:17.241 --> 41:20.111
Wait.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.179
Do you feel that?

41:21.212 --> 41:22.246
Nah, it's too soon.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.215
It's like the blink of an eye.

41:24.248 --> 41:25.717
You guys, get back.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.158
Everybody get ready!

41:34.192 --> 41:35.093
We don't know what's coming
outta there!

41:35.126 --> 41:36.294
Soldiers!

41:36.327 --> 41:40.598
[rumbling]

41:47.405 --> 41:48.940
Come on!

42:00.752 --> 42:02.620
Nicholson, you get the one
on the left.

42:02.653 --> 42:03.621
Julius.

42:04.455 --> 42:05.957
Violet?

42:05.990 --> 42:08.659
Vi, hey!

42:08.693 --> 42:09.627
Julius?

42:09.660 --> 42:10.528
(Colonel Nicholson)
Ivory! Over here!

42:10.561 --> 42:12.830
It's okay, kid. I got you.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.965
Jack!

42:13.998 --> 42:16.234
Jack. Hey! Hey!

42:16.267 --> 42:17.735
It's me. It's Ivory.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.137
What happened?

42:19.170 --> 42:21.239
The Dark One?

42:21.272 --> 42:23.975
‐The Dark One...
‐Yeah.

42:24.008 --> 42:25.643
Is gone.

42:31.883 --> 42:32.650
Jack?

42:33.184 --> 42:33.985
Jack?

42:34.719 --> 42:35.653
Jack!

42:37.388 --> 42:38.289
Her heart.

42:38.322 --> 42:39.457
She's not breathing!

42:39.490 --> 42:40.758
Get a medic!

42:41.159 --> 42:42.160
Jack!

42:42.193 --> 42:43.928
Come on, come on, wake up.

42:43.961 --> 42:44.862
I can't find a pulse.

42:44.896 --> 42:45.963
We have to save Jack!

42:45.997 --> 42:48.266
[gasping]

42:48.299 --> 42:49.801
Somebody help me!

42:49.834 --> 42:51.202
Somebody help me!!!

42:51.235 --> 42:53.104
No, no, something
is happening to her!

42:53.137 --> 42:54.005
Somebody help!!!

42:54.038 --> 42:56.074
No, no, no, no!!!!!
