00:05.572 --> 00:07.271
Zebra with a gaping hole.

00:07.307 --> 00:09.773
Your brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

00:10.891 --> 00:12.223
(chuckles): I guess she was right.

00:12.248 --> 00:13.691
You're not smart!

00:13.764 --> 00:16.324
We'd need an army to take on Penguin.

00:16.356 --> 00:18.289
Makes me miss Falcone.

00:18.325 --> 00:20.458
SOFIA: You came looking for a gangster.
That's exactly what you found.

00:20.493 --> 00:22.060
I'm a Falcone.

00:22.095 --> 00:23.227
I need to know what you're going to do.

00:23.263 --> 00:24.963
You want the city back from Penguin,

00:24.998 --> 00:26.297
I'll give that to you.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.333
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

00:28.368 --> 00:29.968
The two of you have been whispering

00:30.003 --> 00:32.637

00:32.671 --> 00:34.639
You never deserved her

BARBARA: Yes, I killed him.

00:36.843 --> 00:38.435
I am sorry.

00:38.460 --> 00:40.371
There's a legend about this knife.

00:40.396 --> 00:43.081
The man that killed my grandfather
can't have this.

00:43.116 --> 00:44.082
I promise.

00:44.117 --> 00:46.084
That's Ra's al Ghul.

00:46.119 --> 00:48.753
RA'S AL GHUL: That knife
is the key to everything.

00:48.788 --> 00:50.922
Give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

00:50.957 --> 00:52.523
- Bruce, hand me the knife.
- I can't.

Name's, uh, Gilzean. Maybe Gold?

01:06.706 --> 01:09.841
Took a slug in the noodle.
Been in a coma six months.

01:09.876 --> 01:12.343

01:12.379 --> 01:15.546

02:15.018 --> 02:16.096
No.

02:16.121 --> 02:17.508
I just heard from Judge Bam Bam's clerk.

02:17.544 --> 02:20.211
- His trial got pushed off the docket.
- And?

02:20.246 --> 02:22.714
And I want to make sure
him being minister

02:25.533 --> 02:26.724
He killed a boy.

That's above my pay grade, pal.

from the judge's clerk;
it's about Ra's al Ghul.

02:55.849 --> 02:57.548
Here.

02:57.584 --> 02:59.450
I'm doing my job.

03:16.302 --> 03:18.503
Once more, about that boy's death...

03:18.538 --> 03:20.638
Don't say it's not my fault.

03:20.673 --> 03:22.609
It is my fault.

03:22.710 --> 03:24.375
Alex is dead because I hesitated.

03:24.410 --> 03:25.710
Well, perhaps you did,

03:25.745 --> 03:27.421
but that doesn't make you
his murderer, does it?

03:27.446 --> 03:30.132
Ra's killed that innocent little boy,

03:30.157 --> 03:31.179
and he's gonna pay for it.

03:31.204 --> 03:33.117
You really think locking him up
in Blackgate will stop him?

03:33.153 --> 03:35.153
He still wants this dagger.

03:35.188 --> 03:36.454
Stop going on about
the bloody dagger, will you?

03:36.489 --> 03:38.116
Just so we can just get some breakfast.

03:38.141 --> 03:39.490
- Please.
- I think I finally found something

03:39.526 --> 03:41.093
in Dr. Winthrop's notes.

03:41.118 --> 03:42.460
There's a description on the handle

03:42.495 --> 03:44.760
that Dr. Winthrop was able to decipher.

03:44.785 --> 03:46.531
Says the knife is intended for the one

03:46.566 --> 03:48.499
who has bathed in the healing waters.

03:48.535 --> 03:49.967
Right. Well, assuming that's not me,

03:50.003 --> 03:51.435
that must be our boy Ra's.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.482
But that doesn't have
to mean it's for him to use.

03:54.507 --> 03:57.542
Perhaps it's to be used against him.

03:57.577 --> 03:59.343
I see.

03:59.379 --> 04:00.344
No.

04:00.380 --> 04:02.046
You clearly don't.

04:02.081 --> 04:03.514
What you're suggesting is

04:03.550 --> 04:04.715
that knife and that knife alone

04:04.751 --> 04:06.384
is the only thing capable
of doing him in.

04:06.419 --> 04:08.452
If Ra's al Ghul believes
this knife will kill him,

04:08.488 --> 04:10.321
that could explain why
he wants it so badly.

04:10.356 --> 04:11.722
So he can destroy it.

04:12.863 --> 04:15.560
Before someone fulfills the prophecy.

04:18.964 --> 04:22.065
Master Bruce, I know that
you feel bad about Alex.

04:22.101 --> 04:23.701
We all do.

04:23.736 --> 04:26.838
But at this point, you
must remember your vow.

04:28.842 --> 04:30.842
No killing.

04:31.736 --> 04:33.316
No killing.

04:34.297 --> 04:36.924
Taking a life, never mind how justified,

04:36.949 --> 04:38.149
will lead you down

04:38.184 --> 04:40.484
a darker path than
you could ever possibly imagine.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.320
I know. I've been down it.

04:43.064 --> 04:44.522
You understand me, Master Bruce?

04:44.557 --> 04:46.390
I understand.

04:46.426 --> 04:48.125
Good.

04:57.203 --> 04:59.403
Let's get yourself ready.

05:12.485 --> 05:16.394

05:21.294 --> 05:22.593

05:47.787 --> 05:49.420
You are joking, aren't you?

05:49.455 --> 05:52.390

this as a courtesy.

06:01.267 --> 06:03.121

06:07.006 --> 06:09.307
And you blame me?

06:10.661 --> 06:12.327
You're his guardian, aren't you?

06:12.352 --> 06:13.477
You're supposed to protect him,

06:13.513 --> 06:15.513
and instead you've been
placing him in harm's way.

06:15.548 --> 06:17.748
ALFRED: Oh, I see. So that's
what rankles, is it?

06:17.784 --> 06:20.117
Keeping you in the dark.
Well, if I was you,

06:20.142 --> 06:21.953
I'd focus on your own job, Detective,

06:21.988 --> 06:24.701
which is keeping Ra's al Ghul
behind bars, tucked up.

06:24.726 --> 06:26.691
Just keep the news away
from Bruce as long as you can.

06:26.726 --> 06:30.065
On that, we agree, Detective.

11:04.191 --> 11:08.362
86% of crime is accounted for

The Falcone name.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.652
A name that once accounted

12:02.706 --> 12:06.056

somewhere public.

12:16.718 --> 12:18.668

Gotham that you have

12:18.704 --> 12:20.604
the support of the Falcone family.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.339
And that should be enough to send

Insomnia, anxiety! You have
to have something for me!

12:59.725 --> 13:01.645
I don't know, a pill
to reverse the effect

13:01.680 --> 13:03.323
of having your brain
frozen and unfrozen?

13:03.348 --> 13:04.948
That's kind of specific.

13:04.983 --> 13:06.583
(bottle shatters)

13:07.507 --> 13:10.003
I will not be condescended to

13:10.028 --> 13:12.155
by an idiot in a lab coat!

13:12.190 --> 13:14.324
You're not even a doctor!

13:14.359 --> 13:18.029
Okay, relax, man.
Just... tell me your symptoms.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.963
Fogginess of the mind.

13:20.530 --> 13:22.441
Decreased capacity
to think ten steps ahead.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.699
Inability to solve riddles!

13:25.724 --> 13:26.972
God.

13:26.997 --> 13:29.673
I have got to improve my brain function.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.649
I could take a pill or a vitamin.

13:32.674 --> 13:34.751
I'll even consider a natural remedy.

13:34.776 --> 13:37.870
I don't want to get your hopes
up, but there is something.

13:37.906 --> 13:39.665
What? Tell me.

13:39.690 --> 13:40.807
A trial drug.

13:40.842 --> 13:44.243
It claims to boost your
natural cognitive abilities.

13:44.279 --> 13:45.578
That's perfect. Where is this?

13:45.613 --> 13:46.946
The sample drawer.

13:46.981 --> 13:48.981
What is it called?

13:49.017 --> 13:51.470
Uh, Smartivia.
Blue pills, diamond-shaped.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.152
Smartivia. Smartivia.

13:53.188 --> 13:54.520
I don't see them.

13:54.556 --> 13:56.022
Try towards the back.

13:56.411 --> 13:57.677
I don't see it.

13:57.702 --> 13:59.692
Ah, here it is.

14:02.864 --> 14:04.715
Ow!

14:05.357 --> 14:07.221
Oh! God!

14:07.246 --> 14:08.735
(pained grunting)

14:08.770 --> 14:10.670
A fake gun?

14:10.705 --> 14:12.905
Seriously?

14:12.941 --> 14:15.742
Ow! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I just need to know.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.104
- Do these work?
- No, dummy.

14:18.140 --> 14:19.606
They're sugar pills.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.041
And I'm calling the police.

14:22.077 --> 14:24.177
(groans)

14:24.212 --> 14:25.445
(alarm blaring)

14:25.480 --> 14:27.191
Go on, do it, do it...

14:27.216 --> 14:29.449
(groans, pants)

14:33.422 --> 14:35.054
(siren approaching)

14:40.829 --> 14:42.362
(low growl)

14:42.397 --> 14:43.897
(panting)

14:49.237 --> 14:51.738
- (growls)
- Oh!

14:55.106 --> 14:56.409
Butch.

14:57.137 --> 15:00.018
You... know Grundy?

15:00.043 --> 15:01.199
Butch...

15:01.251 --> 15:03.957
I have never had an issue with you.

15:03.988 --> 15:05.752
Barbara Kean... she is the problem.

15:05.787 --> 15:07.854
You and Tabitha are innocent bystanders.

15:07.889 --> 15:09.456
Wow, you don't get much sun.

15:09.491 --> 15:10.924
No...

15:13.361 --> 15:15.662
Man talk too much.

15:17.766 --> 15:20.733
(sirens wailing in distance)

15:20.943 --> 15:23.426
- Collins, deal with this, will you?
- Yep.

15:23.451 --> 15:24.737
Gordon.

15:24.773 --> 15:25.772
Gordon.

15:25.807 --> 15:27.474
Bruce is gone.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.814
- What?
- You've got to get me into Blackgate.

15:29.839 --> 15:30.908
What are you talking about?

15:30.932 --> 15:32.713
When we got back from the
wake, he said he was gonna go

15:32.714 --> 15:35.248
straight to bed, but he must've
snuck out between then and now.

15:35.283 --> 15:38.251
My concern is that he's
taken the knife...

15:38.734 --> 15:41.421
and he's gonna try and kill
Ra's al Ghul.

15:41.656 --> 15:43.456
You're serious?

15:43.492 --> 15:45.024
Yes, I'm bloody serious.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.759
We've got to go to Blackgate now.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.761
And then you can tell me the many ways

15:48.797 --> 15:50.497
I've failed the child, all right?

15:50.532 --> 15:52.632
- Oh, I will.
- Listen to me.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.434
The boy is on the verge
of doing something

15:54.469 --> 15:56.936
that there's no coming back from.

15:56.961 --> 15:59.628
He needs our help.

16:00.675 --> 16:02.208
Right.

16:02.244 --> 16:03.810
Let's go.

16:06.014 --> 16:08.014
(dogs barking)

16:29.888 --> 16:31.421
Yeah, it's about time.

16:31.453 --> 16:32.979
Shift ended five minutes ago.

16:33.008 --> 16:34.440
Come on.

16:54.729 --> 16:56.529
(lock clacks)

17:06.877 --> 17:08.308
(beep)

17:09.644 --> 17:11.344
(soft whooshing)

17:11.378 --> 17:13.780
♪ ♪

17:33.134 --> 17:35.335
♪ ♪

17:43.278 --> 17:45.278
(sheathes knife)

17:46.514 --> 17:48.558
You weak...

17:48.854 --> 17:52.626
foolish... boy.

18:07.135 --> 18:09.035
You're still not ready.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.708
(coughs)

18:19.219 --> 18:20.652
My name is Bruce Wayne.

18:20.677 --> 18:23.883
Stop him. Stop him.

18:27.389 --> 18:28.855
Master al Ghul.

18:30.492 --> 18:32.107
Take him below.

18:32.193 --> 18:34.460
What? What are you doing?

18:44.818 --> 18:47.683
We got your call, but...
I checked the logs...

18:47.708 --> 18:49.875
- Bruce Wayne hasn't been here.
- With all due respect,

18:49.910 --> 18:51.877
I don't think he'd come
as a regular visitor.

18:51.912 --> 18:53.492
He's a billionaire, after all.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.735
I think what Mr. Pennyworth
is trying to say is

18:55.782 --> 18:58.316
Bruce Wayne could have paid
someone to get him in here.

18:58.352 --> 18:59.517
No offense.

18:59.553 --> 19:02.320
We just want to look around.

19:03.357 --> 19:05.323
Sure. Whatever you want.

19:05.359 --> 19:07.826
But you came all the way here
for nothing.

19:07.861 --> 19:09.895
And we're gonna need your weapons.

19:12.199 --> 19:14.332
Standard procedure.

19:14.368 --> 19:16.902
Of course.

19:19.239 --> 19:20.972
(clears throat)

19:25.045 --> 19:26.511
(clears throat)

19:38.258 --> 19:40.182
- Finished?
- That's absolutely it.

19:40.207 --> 19:42.193
Unless you want to check
my undercrackers.

19:43.430 --> 19:46.197
This way.

19:46.233 --> 19:49.000
(whispers): Undercrackers?

19:50.037 --> 19:52.570
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

19:52.606 --> 19:55.140
They're here.

19:55.175 --> 19:58.176
(sirens wailing)

19:59.212 --> 20:01.212
(car horns honking in distance)

20:03.250 --> 20:05.016
(groans)

20:07.454 --> 20:09.688
(pained gasps)

20:13.627 --> 20:16.361
Sugar pills, my foot.

20:16.396 --> 20:19.564
That dream was horrible.

20:19.599 --> 20:21.099
Oh, God!

20:21.134 --> 20:23.568
Oh, you're real. (gasping)

20:23.603 --> 20:24.602
Oh...

20:24.937 --> 20:27.500
You... know...

20:28.075 --> 20:29.240
...Grundy?

20:29.276 --> 20:31.211
What? No. No.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.677
No, who's Grundy?

20:32.713 --> 20:35.080
Solomon Grundy.

20:35.586 --> 20:37.615
Born on Monday.

20:38.211 --> 20:40.251
Your hand! How...

20:40.922 --> 20:42.520
I'm sorry.

20:42.556 --> 20:44.489
What happened to you?

20:46.329 --> 20:47.985
Grundy not know.

20:49.625 --> 20:50.755
Okay, let me get this straight.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.697
You don't... remember...

20:52.895 --> 20:54.793
who you are

20:55.012 --> 20:56.774
or how you got here?

20:57.604 --> 20:58.970
(laughs)

21:00.640 --> 21:02.574
I'm sorry.

21:02.609 --> 21:04.109
Grundy...

21:04.144 --> 21:07.540
I don't know you. Best of luck, though.

21:07.565 --> 21:09.714
Hope you get the skin thing
figured out. Later.

21:09.750 --> 21:10.882
(groans)

21:10.917 --> 21:13.385
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

21:13.420 --> 21:15.720
You know Grundy.

21:15.782 --> 21:17.922
You help Grundy.

21:18.086 --> 21:19.557
Be...

21:19.680 --> 21:20.992
Grundy...

21:21.367 --> 21:22.701
friend.

21:24.698 --> 21:26.998
I'm attempting to be civil...

21:27.973 --> 21:29.834
but I can't help you.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.469
Why?

21:31.505 --> 21:33.238
I just can't, all right?

21:33.273 --> 21:34.839
- Why?
- Because...

21:34.875 --> 21:36.074
Why?!

21:36.109 --> 21:38.957
Because I can't even help myself!

21:38.982 --> 21:40.521
Ow.

21:41.935 --> 21:44.156
You don't know who you are.

21:44.184 --> 21:46.230
Well, that makes two of us.

21:46.453 --> 21:50.496
I used to be smart... brilliant...

21:50.824 --> 21:52.624
and now that's gone.

21:52.669 --> 21:54.686
I can't even rob a pharmacy!

21:55.695 --> 21:58.530
So you want me to help you?

21:59.729 --> 22:01.896
I can't.

22:15.905 --> 22:18.516
Well, I am feeling a pit peckish.

22:28.071 --> 22:30.138
We are closed.

22:30.163 --> 22:32.030
Janos.

22:32.915 --> 22:34.961
Last I saw you was at my tenth birthday.

22:34.986 --> 22:36.642
You bought me ruby earrings.

22:36.670 --> 22:38.570
Said it would be a fitting gift

22:38.605 --> 22:40.605
for the daughter of the king of Gotham.

22:42.175 --> 22:43.807
Sofia Falcone.

22:44.044 --> 22:46.158
I heard you had returned to Gotham.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.251
What can I do for you?

22:48.642 --> 22:50.348
I was wondering how you were faring

22:50.383 --> 22:52.016
under Penguin's rule.

22:52.688 --> 22:54.719
The Szabo family is quite content

22:54.754 --> 22:57.713
under Oswald Cobblepot's
licensing system.

22:57.738 --> 22:59.524
But even if we were not,

23:00.082 --> 23:02.996
we would be wise enough
not to say anything.

23:03.854 --> 23:05.774
Good. Because I've invited him

23:05.799 --> 23:07.265
to your restaurant for lunch,

23:07.479 --> 23:10.776
and I want it to be a lunch
he'll never forget.

23:27.716 --> 23:30.044
RA'S AL GHUL: Bruce.

23:36.810 --> 23:38.655
BRUCE: Where am I?

23:38.832 --> 23:40.899
Beneath Blackgate Penitentiary.

23:41.802 --> 23:44.388
Alfred Pennyworth and Jim Gordon

23:44.794 --> 23:47.472
are upstairs in the company,

23:47.507 --> 23:50.318
unbeknownst to them, of my men.

23:50.343 --> 23:51.309
Let them go.

23:51.344 --> 23:53.028
They have nothing to do with this.

23:53.053 --> 23:56.428
Still playing
the white knight, Bruce.

23:56.453 --> 23:58.449
You replaced the guards
before I got here.

23:58.485 --> 24:00.822
I'm sure your friends
can fend for themselves.

24:00.847 --> 24:02.554
You applied for diplomatic immunity,

24:02.589 --> 24:04.410
knowing I'd hear about it

24:04.591 --> 24:05.790
and come for you.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.392
I wanted the knife,

24:08.090 --> 24:09.961
but not for the reason you think.

24:12.324 --> 24:16.218
It's been ages since
I first held this dagger.

24:17.031 --> 24:19.971
It was given to me
moments after I was bathed

24:20.006 --> 24:21.982
in the Lazarus Pit.

24:22.684 --> 24:25.451
Submerged in the waters...

24:27.614 --> 24:29.614
(gasps)

24:33.620 --> 24:36.321
...suspended between

24:36.356 --> 24:39.203
life and death,

24:40.156 --> 24:42.694
I saw a vision of you...

24:44.497 --> 24:46.564
...my heir.

24:48.168 --> 24:49.467
You're insane.

24:49.828 --> 24:51.386
I'm not your heir.

24:51.411 --> 24:53.237
I don't even understand what that means.

24:53.262 --> 24:56.801
It means that you are the only one

24:56.895 --> 24:59.638
who can end my suffering.

25:03.763 --> 25:06.076
Please.

25:07.354 --> 25:09.503
You want me to kill you?

25:11.191 --> 25:12.957
Set me free.

25:24.672 --> 25:26.172
Well, thanks for the snack, big guy.

25:27.542 --> 25:29.317
It's been an emotional day.

25:30.271 --> 25:31.911
I got to go.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.899
- No.
- Oh.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.934
Not this again. Come on!

25:35.969 --> 25:39.804
God... I've told you,
I'm better off on my own,

25:39.840 --> 25:41.568
and you are, too.

25:41.593 --> 25:43.141
So let go!

25:43.176 --> 25:44.609
Let go!

25:44.645 --> 25:46.411
MAN: Hey, freak.

25:46.446 --> 25:48.179
Ha, I knew we'd find you.

25:48.215 --> 25:50.282
And it looks like you got a friend.

25:50.307 --> 25:52.440
(chuckles) I assure you,

25:52.486 --> 25:54.119
we are not friends.

25:54.154 --> 25:55.487
MAN: Get 'em.

25:55.522 --> 25:56.655
Both of 'em.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.656
No! No!

25:57.691 --> 26:00.458
(grunting, screaming)

26:07.467 --> 26:09.534
Grundy!

26:09.569 --> 26:11.803
(screaming)

26:11.838 --> 26:14.700
- (screaming)
- Hot... hot!

26:14.724 --> 26:16.464
Grundy friend, help!

26:16.510 --> 26:19.477
Don't leave, no. Help. Help.

26:19.508 --> 26:21.079
Hot.

26:21.148 --> 26:24.189
Hot... hot...

26:24.484 --> 26:26.117
- (steam hissing)
- (sighing)

26:29.784 --> 26:31.515
Grundy friend not dumb.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.727
Grundy friend... smart.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.328
Well, I guess...

26:38.665 --> 26:40.398
...yeah, you're right.

26:40.434 --> 26:42.867
Water beats fire. (laughs)

26:42.903 --> 26:45.323
That was smart. (chuckles)

26:46.073 --> 26:47.238
Oh, boy...

26:47.274 --> 26:49.374
(grunts)

26:49.409 --> 26:51.669
(straining): I can't breathe.

26:52.079 --> 26:55.046
(horn honks, siren wails)

27:04.524 --> 27:07.592
Oswald. They said this is
their best table.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.194
Interesting choice.

27:09.983 --> 27:12.129
Are you sure it's not too intimate?

27:12.272 --> 27:13.690
The point was to get the word out

27:13.715 --> 27:15.277
that the Falcones support me.

27:15.535 --> 27:17.802
Don't worry, people will talk.

27:20.909 --> 27:22.142
I chose this place

27:22.167 --> 27:23.908
because I heard your mother
was Hungarian.

27:24.311 --> 27:26.112
I thought you might like
a taste of home.

27:46.037 --> 27:49.134
I can assure you, Oswald,
I'm not here to poison you.

27:49.740 --> 27:51.109
Perhaps.

27:51.134 --> 27:53.138
(coughing)

27:53.311 --> 27:56.746
The chef likes to go heavy
on the paprika, doesn't he?

27:56.771 --> 27:58.043
(coughing)

27:58.078 --> 28:00.145
How is the food, otherwise?

28:01.052 --> 28:02.981
Serviceable.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.292
Well, I'm stuffed.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.754
Thank you so much
for meeting me, Miss Falcone.

28:09.847 --> 28:11.880
(louder): And thank you to your
family for their support.

28:11.905 --> 28:14.539
You can't leave until
you've tried the goulash.

28:14.575 --> 28:16.341
If it's anything like
the chicken paprika,

28:16.784 --> 28:19.377
- I'll pass.
- It's the house specialty.

28:24.351 --> 28:25.817
(sighs)

28:27.855 --> 28:29.721
My mother made goulash.

28:29.756 --> 28:31.990
Brought the recipe from Budapest.

28:32.017 --> 28:35.260
Handed down through her family
for 300 years.

28:37.767 --> 28:40.248
I doubt this will hold a candle.

29:04.728 --> 29:06.558
- I'm leaving!
- SOFIA: Oswald?

29:07.794 --> 29:09.294
Oswald?

29:14.034 --> 29:16.201
It took me forever
to find his mother's recipe.

29:16.236 --> 29:18.403
Did you follow it exactly?

29:18.438 --> 29:20.438
I followed the recipe to a T.

29:20.474 --> 29:22.574
The little man didn't like?

29:23.380 --> 29:25.710
Honestly, I don't know.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.285
GORDON: How long have you worked here?

29:33.320 --> 29:35.652
Two years, thereabouts.

29:35.923 --> 29:38.190
I was in Blackgate for a time.

29:38.225 --> 29:39.391
We must not have overlapped.

29:39.426 --> 29:41.693
Here? As a guard?

29:41.728 --> 29:43.746
As a prisoner.

29:43.964 --> 29:46.431
Oh, yeah. Heard about that.

29:46.466 --> 29:47.899
Is there a reason why
you're not taking us

29:47.935 --> 29:49.634
through maximum security?

29:49.670 --> 29:52.204
Prisoners are in the yard
this time of day.

29:52.856 --> 29:55.023
Been some changes since you were here.

29:57.844 --> 29:58.944
"McCloskey."

29:59.387 --> 30:01.112
That's funny.

30:01.301 --> 30:04.082
I know another J. McCloskey
who works here.

30:06.116 --> 30:08.987
My cousin. Gets confusing sometimes.

30:09.197 --> 30:11.443
All right, let's go.

30:11.468 --> 30:13.158
- Through this door.
- ALFRED: I got to say, mate,

30:13.193 --> 30:14.759
I really love what you've
done with the old place.

30:14.795 --> 30:17.397
However, I've got a question for you.

30:17.764 --> 30:19.898
Yeah?

30:19.933 --> 30:21.700
Where are the real guards?

30:22.502 --> 30:24.736
(grunting)

30:28.842 --> 30:32.611
(gunshots)

30:37.398 --> 30:39.337
Where is Bruce Wayne?

30:39.838 --> 30:41.820
Ra's al Ghul has plans for the boy.

30:41.855 --> 30:42.821
Where is he?!

30:42.856 --> 30:45.190
(laughs) You'll never find him.

30:45.225 --> 30:48.059
Oh, you underestimate my resolve, pal.

30:54.167 --> 30:55.955
Well, at least we know Bruce is here.

30:55.994 --> 30:57.936
Well, we've walked the floor.
Where could he be?

30:57.971 --> 30:59.588
There's the yard,

30:59.642 --> 31:02.166
the tower... but they're too public.

31:02.843 --> 31:05.321
There's a sub-basement,
accessible by the service elevator.

31:05.354 --> 31:07.020
Which way?

31:13.429 --> 31:15.429
(car horns honking in distance)

31:18.415 --> 31:20.482
(door opens)

31:22.866 --> 31:24.966
(scoffs)

31:25.125 --> 31:27.872
Who did I tell you specifically
not to let in here?!

31:27.913 --> 31:31.581
Uh, Miss Falcone is here
to see you, sir.

31:33.864 --> 31:35.297
I'm sorry, Oswald.

31:35.332 --> 31:36.998
I'm not sure what upset you, but I...

31:37.034 --> 31:38.133
Enough!

31:38.911 --> 31:40.645
Did you think I would really believe

31:40.670 --> 31:42.373
this was all some coincidence?

31:42.873 --> 31:45.941
That goulash tasted exactly
like my mother used to make!

31:46.013 --> 31:48.914
You can't fault me for
the restaurant's authenticity.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.416
You're buttering me up.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.252
But for what?

31:53.958 --> 31:55.587
Is it so hard to believe

31:55.623 --> 31:58.372
that someone would want to do
something nice for you?

31:58.397 --> 31:59.411
There was only one person

31:59.436 --> 32:00.833
in my whole life
who ever did things for me

32:00.858 --> 32:02.895
without wanting something in return.

32:02.930 --> 32:04.897
And that was my mother.

32:04.932 --> 32:07.303
Then I envy you.

32:07.635 --> 32:11.270
My father never helped anyone
unless it benefited him.

32:11.305 --> 32:14.640
And eventually it drove away
everyone who loved him.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.744
Go.

32:18.779 --> 32:21.046
I'll decide what to do with you later.

32:24.718 --> 32:27.386
Oswald, I only want to help you.

32:27.421 --> 32:29.354
Oh, you want to help? Try leaving.

32:29.390 --> 32:31.123
(sniffles)

32:31.775 --> 32:33.590
Your foot.

32:34.065 --> 32:35.879
It's just the weather.

32:36.090 --> 32:38.096
(exhales)

32:43.671 --> 32:45.604
What are you doing?

32:48.225 --> 32:50.242
- Don't.
- It's okay.

32:50.631 --> 32:52.451
I won't judge.

33:13.288 --> 33:15.255
When I was a child, I broke my ankle

33:15.280 --> 33:17.111
while playing with my cousins.

33:18.384 --> 33:20.739
I was desperate.

33:21.013 --> 33:22.908
Crying in pain.

33:23.724 --> 33:26.111
My father told me to put ice on it.

33:26.310 --> 33:28.826
Toughen up, stop with the tears.

33:29.350 --> 33:31.516
But my mother went with me
to the hospital.

33:32.282 --> 33:34.104
And on the way, she told me

33:34.129 --> 33:36.848
that cold actually increases the pain.

33:38.525 --> 33:42.187
What's needed is warmth.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.397
My mother.

33:47.668 --> 33:49.773
She used to sing.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.973
(humming)

34:12.197 --> 34:16.094
RA'S AL GHUL: This may be
hard for you to understand.

34:17.998 --> 34:21.719
But I have walked this earth
for centuries.

34:22.101 --> 34:24.674
Waiting for you, Bruce.

34:25.116 --> 34:27.315
Only you can kill me.

34:27.594 --> 34:30.042
And only with that dagger.

34:30.174 --> 34:32.784
That is my curse.

34:33.179 --> 34:35.853
That is the meaning of my vision.

34:36.083 --> 34:38.083
I don't believe you.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.717
Believe me.

34:39.753 --> 34:42.187
This is just another manipulation.

34:43.223 --> 34:44.755
See.

34:46.726 --> 34:48.226
Look.

34:48.262 --> 34:50.728
My true form.

34:52.036 --> 34:54.505
Every moment of my life

34:54.530 --> 34:56.328
is agony.

34:58.648 --> 35:01.002
End my suffering.

35:02.276 --> 35:05.028
Whatever your curse is,

35:06.273 --> 35:08.440
you deserve it for what you've done.

35:08.465 --> 35:11.216
You're angry, Bruce. I understand.

35:11.251 --> 35:13.785
But unless you strike me down
with that blade,

35:13.821 --> 35:15.306
you will never be free.

35:15.331 --> 35:16.436
No!

35:18.425 --> 35:20.131
I won't.

35:21.895 --> 35:24.730
Then allow me to tell you
what will happen...

35:26.380 --> 35:28.217
...if you don't kill me.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.169
I will disappear

35:33.365 --> 35:36.288
and let you live your life.

35:36.928 --> 35:39.627
You will follow the path of light.

35:40.447 --> 35:42.814
Grow into a fine man.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.883
Become a husband.

35:45.159 --> 35:47.471
A father.

35:47.757 --> 35:52.828
There may be a day
when you forget I ever existed.

35:55.362 --> 35:59.071
But then I will return.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.935
And I will kill everyone you love.

36:04.164 --> 36:07.307
Just as you watched your parents die,

36:07.374 --> 36:12.265
just as you watched me
slice your friend's throat,

36:12.438 --> 36:16.240
I will slaughter your wife and children

36:16.283 --> 36:18.250
before your very eyes,

36:18.285 --> 36:22.120
and there will be nothing
you can do about it.

36:22.689 --> 36:25.190
(shouts)

36:25.215 --> 36:27.192
- Die.
- (dagger slices)

36:27.227 --> 36:29.194
(yells)

36:46.155 --> 36:47.883
Yes.

36:47.981 --> 36:49.981
(panting)

36:52.486 --> 36:54.886
(crackling)

37:18.931 --> 37:21.079
MAN (over speaker):
<i>Attention, all inmates.</i>

37:21.150 --> 37:23.028
<i>The prison is on official lockdown.</i>

37:23.068 --> 37:25.068
(continues indistinctly)

37:30.612 --> 37:32.482
Are you going to arrest me?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.011
For what?

37:36.681 --> 37:38.214
For murder.

37:38.426 --> 37:40.250
I don't know what I just saw in there.

37:40.285 --> 37:42.085
But as far as I'm concerned,

37:42.120 --> 37:45.688
Ra's al Ghul's men broke
into Blackgate and he escaped.

37:47.159 --> 37:50.917
I betrayed myself
and my parents' memory.

37:52.164 --> 37:54.130
I took a life.

37:54.471 --> 37:57.175
I did exactly what Ra's said I would.

37:57.703 --> 37:59.669
Just because you know you're
capable of doing something

37:59.694 --> 38:01.597
doesn't mean it has to happen again.

38:04.442 --> 38:07.570
Bruce, you and I have known
each other a long time.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.117
Since the night
your parents were murdered.

38:10.382 --> 38:12.600
Now, you may not feel
like you're that kid anymore,

38:12.625 --> 38:14.344
but I know that you are.

38:14.976 --> 38:17.520
One who believes in doing good.

38:17.961 --> 38:20.601
In fighting for what's right.

38:21.059 --> 38:24.460
Who will do anything to keep
the people he loves safe.

38:26.474 --> 38:30.976
Nothing that happened today
changes that.

38:43.048 --> 38:45.014
What are you doing?

38:45.050 --> 38:47.050
You said it yourself.

38:48.320 --> 38:50.174
It's over.

38:50.589 --> 38:52.989
No.

38:53.024 --> 38:55.243
- Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.
- Alfred.

38:55.268 --> 38:56.793
Listen, we started

38:56.828 --> 39:00.897
this vigilante caper to prepare
for Ra's' return, didn't we?

39:00.932 --> 39:03.333
But it's become
so much bigger than that.

39:03.876 --> 39:07.191
I see that now. I mean,
I was wrong and you were right.

39:07.906 --> 39:10.773
You can make a difference.

39:12.544 --> 39:15.781
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

39:16.181 --> 39:20.350
I made that decision the
moment I killed Ra's al Ghul.

39:22.287 --> 39:24.624
I took the dark path.

39:26.547 --> 39:28.170
Yes, you did.

39:28.560 --> 39:31.988
And it's gonna be
a long, bumpy journey back.

39:32.564 --> 39:34.764
But I believe in you, Master Bruce.

39:34.799 --> 39:38.496
I always have, and I... I always will.

39:39.551 --> 39:42.522
Now, I understand
that you don't feel worthy now.

39:43.141 --> 39:46.476
But when you do, this...

39:48.546 --> 39:51.547
...this will be waiting for you.

39:53.585 --> 39:55.985
As will I, sir.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.160

40:19.068 --> 40:20.944
didn't even have five bucks between 'em.

40:21.224 --> 40:23.646
(scoffs) We need a new plan.

40:28.286 --> 40:29.919
What?

40:30.614 --> 40:32.155
Truth.

40:32.348 --> 40:34.234
Grundy friend...

40:34.559 --> 40:37.923
know Grundy?

40:38.892 --> 40:40.938
You deserve to know.

40:41.766 --> 40:43.967
You and I...

40:47.050 --> 40:49.439
...were the very best of friends.

40:49.605 --> 40:51.441
And then something happened to you.

40:51.527 --> 40:52.988
And I just didn't recognize you.

40:53.019 --> 40:56.512
But what is important
is that, with your muscles,

40:57.246 --> 40:59.212
we can make money.

40:59.237 --> 41:02.604
And with money,
we can make me smart again.

41:03.424 --> 41:05.455
And then we'll figure out
what happened to you.

41:05.885 --> 41:08.557
Just trust me. Okay?

41:12.163 --> 41:14.130
Grundy, come on.
