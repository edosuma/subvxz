WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:05.006
DRAGON:
In a land of myth and a time of magic,

00:05.089 --> 00:07.341
the destiny of a great kingdom

00:07.425 --> 00:10.219
rests on the shoulders
of a young boy.

00:10.344 --> 00:13.181
His name, Merlin.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.033
(BRANCH BREAKING)

00:51.928 --> 00:53.471
(SOFTLY) Merlin?

00:56.140 --> 00:57.934
What is it?

00:58.392 --> 01:02.104
| don't know.
We'll surround it.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.067
| want you to go in there
and flush it out.

01:07.151 --> 01:09.070
You want me to go in there?

01:09.153 --> 01:10.488
You just said you
don't know what it is.

01:10.613 --> 01:12.156
It could be dangerous.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.450
Let's hope so. Now go.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.976
Go! Go!

02:22.268 --> 02:24.228
Please go!

02:25.563 --> 02:28.149
They're gonna kill you.
Please go!

02:29.900 --> 02:31.402
Arthur, no!

02:32.528 --> 02:33.654
(WHINNYING)

02:51.422 --> 02:53.632
I'm sorry.

02:54.717 --> 02:56.344
Sorry.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.929
(CHUCKLES) Unicorn.

03:00.348 --> 03:04.226
-What have you done?
-Don't be such a girl, Merlin.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.111
What are you looking at?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.858
Father?

03:53.067 --> 03:56.946
A unicorn's horn
to grace the walls of Camelot.

03:59.115 --> 04:01.367
Magnificent.

04:02.159 --> 04:06.997
It's the first one I have seen.
Gaius, look at this.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.877
It is very impressive,
my lord.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.548
What is it, Gaius?
Speak your mind.

04:16.048 --> 04:18.843
Unicorns are rare
and mystical creatures.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.428
There is a legend that says that

04:20.511 --> 04:23.097
bad fortune will come
to anyone who slays one.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.640
UTHER: Nonsense.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.144
We will be the envy of every kingdom.

04:29.061 --> 04:30.896
| am pleased you like it.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.904
| don't understand how Arthur
can have taken any pleasure

04:38.988 --> 04:40.281
from killing the Unicorn.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.533
Arthur is a hunter.
It's in his blood.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.870
Whereas you're something
entirely different.

04:46.328 --> 04:50.374
It was the most beautiful creature
| have ever seen.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.377
-I wish you'd been there.
-It's a rare privilege.

04:53.461 --> 04:56.380
Alas, there are very few unicorns
still alive.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.174
You try telling that to Arthur.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.259
| can imagine it would be difficult.

05:01.594 --> 05:04.430
ARTHUR: My horse threw a shoe.
Take it to the blacksmith.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.266
Make sure he does a good job.
And when you've done that,

05:07.349 --> 05:10.895
you can polish my saddle.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.566
Merlin, have you listened
to a word I've said?

05:16.233 --> 05:18.527
You've got a face like a wounded bear

05:18.611 --> 05:20.196
ever since we got back
from that hunting trip.

05:20.279 --> 05:23.240
Don't tell me you're still upset
about the unicorn?

05:25.034 --> 05:27.286
| don't think you should have killed it.

05:27.369 --> 05:30.247
Oh, really? And why is that?

05:30.831 --> 05:33.250
It was doing no harm.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.753
What purpose did you serve
by killing it?

05:35.836 --> 05:38.756
We were hunting. That's what you do.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.635
Would you have me bring it home
as a pet?

05:44.094 --> 05:46.639
-Look at this.
-What?

05:46.847 --> 05:49.266
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

05:49.391 --> 05:51.477
Rat droppings.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.187
My chambers are infested.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.856
You need to spend less time
worrying about unicorns,

05:55.940 --> 05:57.399
and more time worrying about rats.

05:57.483 --> 05:58.859
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

05:58.943 --> 06:00.069
Enter.

06:00.152 --> 06:03.280
My lord, the King requests your service
as a matter of urgency.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.074
Find that rat.

06:13.165 --> 06:15.668
Every single ear has died.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.713
We have received reports
that it is the same

06:19.797 --> 06:21.006
throughout the entire kingdom.

06:21.090 --> 06:23.259
| rode through this valley yesterday.

06:23.342 --> 06:25.094
The crop looked healthy enough then.

06:25.177 --> 06:28.055
It happened overnight.
The farmers are at a loss to explain it.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.849
-Is it a disease of some kind?
-Perhaps.

06:31.100 --> 06:34.311
| have asked the court physician
to conduct some tests.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.648
We must ration
what little food we have left.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.236
MERLIN:
Any idea what caused the crops to die?

06:42.319 --> 06:43.904
| have yet to complete all the tests,

06:43.988 --> 06:45.447
but no disease I have heard of

06:45.531 --> 06:48.200
could spread through the entire kingdom
in a single night.

06:48.284 --> 06:50.411
What could kill all the plants
other than a disease?

06:50.494 --> 06:52.329
It's not killing all the plants.

06:52.413 --> 06:54.915
The trees and hedges around the crop
fields are unharmed.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.419
Unfortunately,
you can't eat trees and hedges.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.755
-It's only killing plants we can eat?
-It appears so.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.426
If it's not a disease, it must be magic.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.511
We can't assume that, Merlin.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.723
Perhaps there is something in the soil
or water that can explain it.

07:10.806 --> 07:15.269
| can't tell the King it's caused by
sorcery until I am completely certain.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.279
KNIGHT: Next.
ARTHUR: The livestock is either dying,

07:25.362 --> 07:28.032
or it's been eaten.
Food and water is very scarce

07:28.115 --> 07:31.910
and we are distributing rations,
but they are very meager.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.456
This is all the grain we have?

07:37.249 --> 07:40.628
The people are growing scared.
There's been some looting.

07:40.711 --> 07:44.798
Maintain order at all costs.
Panic will make the situation worse.

07:44.882 --> 07:48.010
| will issue a decree
that looters will be executed.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.471
From tonight,
Camelot will be under curfew.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.680
| will see to it.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.558
MAN 1: Give that back. It's mine.
MAN 2: It's not yours.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.519
Merlin, is it true what they're saying
about the crops?

07:57.603 --> 07:58.937
They're all dead?

07:59.021 --> 08:02.524
I'm afraid so. We may have
to start tightening our belts.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.318
I'm sure Arthur will think of something.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.862
And if he doesn't, I will.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.706
Merlin!

08:25.798 --> 08:29.718
Sand?
And you say the well is full of it?

08:29.802 --> 08:32.638
| sent men down to
the underground reservoir.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.349
There's no trace of water to be found.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.934
First the crops and now this.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.520
It's the same throughout the kingdom.

08:40.813 --> 08:43.941
There's precious little water anywhere.

08:45.067 --> 08:48.028
Gaius, can you offer
any explanation for this?

08:48.112 --> 08:50.364
| can't think of
a scientific explanation.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.575
| can only conclude
it's the result of sorcery.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.995
| believe you are right.
It is the work of magic.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.498
The kingdom is under attack.

09:01.417 --> 09:03.711
(CHANTING)

09:11.218 --> 09:14.138
-I was just...
-I was hoping you might be

09:14.221 --> 09:16.348
trying to turn it back into water.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.185
| know I've cautioned
against using magic,

09:20.269 --> 09:24.648
but if ever there were a time
to use your talents, it's now.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.110
| wish I knew how.
I've tried everything.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.238
If it is magic,

09:31.321 --> 09:33.907
it's more powerful magic than I possess.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.211
ARTHUR: Patrol the market
and the lower town.

09:46.295 --> 09:49.757
No one is to leave their homes.
Dismissed.

09:57.848 --> 10:02.311
Merlin, you do realize there's a curfew?

10:02.394 --> 10:05.814
Yeah, I was in your chambers,
hunting for the rat.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.484
-Did you find it?
-No.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.029
So you have been outwitted by a rat?

10:12.196 --> 10:14.531
They do say rats are very intelligent.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.493
More intelligent than you it would seem.
Go home.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.536
It would be embarrassing
to have to lock up my own servant

10:19.620 --> 10:21.330
for breaking the curfew.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.336
-What was that?
-What?

10:59.201 --> 11:02.246
That means you go the other way

11:02.329 --> 11:04.665
-and cut him off.
-Okay.

11:24.685 --> 11:27.354
-Where is he?
- I didn't see anyone.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.440
He was right here. Don't tell me you
let him get past?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.819
-Arthur, no one passed me.
-Are you blind?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.405
Are you looking for me?

11:36.488 --> 11:40.492
| am Anhora, keeper of the unicorns.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.164
Camelot's under curfew.
What's your business here?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.876
| have come to deliver a message.

11:48.959 --> 11:54.339
-And who is this message for?
-It is for you, Arthur Pendragon.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.010
Is it you who is responsible
for killing our crops,

11:58.093 --> 12:01.930
-turning our water into sand?
-You alone are responsible

12:02.014 --> 12:04.391
for the misfortune
that has befallen Camelot.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.268
Me? You think I would bring

12:06.351 --> 12:08.020
drought and famine upon my own people?

12:08.103 --> 12:11.273
When you killed the unicorn,
you unleashed a curse.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.151
For this, Camelot will suffer greatly.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.821
If you have put a curse on Camelot,
you will lift it,

12:17.905 --> 12:21.325
-or you will pay with your life.
-The curse is not my doing.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.411
Undo the curse, or face execution.

12:26.079 --> 12:30.000
Only you can do that.
You will be tested.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.628
You're under arrest.

12:34.922 --> 12:38.383
Until you have proven yourself,
and made amends

12:38.467 --> 12:42.471
for killing the unicorn,
the curse will not be lifted.

12:43.138 --> 12:45.807
If you fail any of these tests,

12:45.933 --> 12:50.270
Camelot will be damned
for all the eternity.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.655
And you believe what this Anhora said
about the curse to be true?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.574
You said there's a legend that
misfortune comes to anyone

13:02.658 --> 13:05.911
who slays a unicorn. It makes sense.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.871
Not much for breakfast, I'm afraid.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.457
We're down to
our last few scraps of food.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.000
Where did you get the water for the tea?

13:12.084 --> 13:17.005
Fortunately, for both of us,
you forgot to empty your bath yesterday.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.676
You're making tea from my bath water?

13:20.759 --> 13:22.886
It's not so bad.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.806
Perhaps a little soapy?

13:28.600 --> 13:31.436
What does Arthur think about the curse?

13:31.520 --> 13:33.271
He doesn't believe it's his fault.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.524
He's convinced
Anhora is responsible for it.

13:35.607 --> 13:37.818
If you do not wish to drink bath water,

13:37.901 --> 13:40.278
you better make sure Arthur sees sense.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.585
That rat!

13:56.169 --> 13:58.338
It's eaten through my boot. Look at it.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.134
| guess the rat must be as hungry
as the rest of us.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.886
-You think this is funny?
-Moderately.

14:05.303 --> 14:08.473
Get it mended, and find that rat.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.686
Have you given any more thought to what
Anhora said last night?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.313
Ah, well, he may have
escaped last night,

14:15.397 --> 14:18.233
but at least we now know
who we're looking for.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.028
I've told my father
that I will find this Anhora

14:21.111 --> 14:22.863
and put an end to it.

14:22.946 --> 14:26.658
What if he was telling the truth
about the curse?

14:26.742 --> 14:29.453
You think I'm responsible
for bringing suffering

14:29.536 --> 14:33.248
-upon my own people?
-No, not deliberately.

14:37.169 --> 14:41.673
When you killed the unicorn,
| saw Anhora in the forest.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.385
-Why didn't you say anything?
-It was just for a second

14:45.469 --> 14:48.847
and then he disappeared.
| thought I was seeing things.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.265
But he was definitely there.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.933
That doesn't actually prove anything.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.935
Doesn't it make you think
he might be telling the truth?

14:54.019 --> 14:55.562
"Cause he was skulking about
in the forest?

14:55.645 --> 14:56.813
It makes me trust him even less.

14:56.897 --> 14:59.524
Why would Anhora appear in Camelot,
then lie to you?

14:59.608 --> 15:00.692
We had him cornered.

15:00.776 --> 15:03.195
He was trying to talk his way out of it
by blaming me.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.780
Arthur, he can disappear into thin air.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.281
He didn't have to talk his way
out of anything.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.992
My father has warned me
about sorcerers like him.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.870
They won't rest until our
kingdom is destroyed.

15:11.953 --> 15:15.999
-I believe he's telling the truth.
-Then you're a fool.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.085
You cannot trust a single word
a sorcerer says.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.128
You would do well to remember that.

15:21.963 --> 15:24.800
Now, I think I've figured out

15:24.883 --> 15:27.886
what Anhora's next move is gonna be,

15:27.969 --> 15:31.515
and when he makes it,
we're gonna be waiting for him.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.447
Don't you worry
about keeping watch, Merlin.

15:47.531 --> 15:50.117
You just make yourself comfortable.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.162
Stop smacking your lips. It's annoying.

15:54.246 --> 15:57.582
-I'm thirsty.
-We're all thirsty, Merlin.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.584
(SIGHS)

16:09.469 --> 16:10.595
Psst.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.347
Someone's coming.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.565
Show yourself before I run you through.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.617
Who are you?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.454
-My name is...
-Speak up.

17:17.996 --> 17:19.580
My name is Evan, my lord.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.540
| see you think you can help yourself

17:21.625 --> 17:23.960
to our grain reserves?

17:24.502 --> 17:26.796
My father has ordered
that looters will be executed.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.674
Please, my lord.
| do not steal for myself.

17:29.758 --> 17:31.092
| have three children.

17:31.176 --> 17:33.428
They have not eaten for two days.
They are hungry.

17:33.511 --> 17:37.807
-It is the same for everyone.
-I know that it's wrong to steal.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.062
| couldn't bear to see them starve.

17:42.145 --> 17:46.274
And could you bear for your children
to see you be executed?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.282
Then you should go home.

17:57.202 --> 18:00.956
If you are caught stealing again,
| will not spare you.

18:01.456 --> 18:04.542
Yes, my lord. Thank you.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.715
Wait.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.730
Use it sparingly.
It might be the last food

18:25.814 --> 18:28.400
you and your family get for some time.

18:29.109 --> 18:33.071
You have shown yourself to be merciful
and kind, my lord.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.659
This will bring its own reward.

18:43.081 --> 18:47.085
-GUARD: Stop him!
-Stop that man! He's been looting!

19:23.580 --> 19:25.457
| never knew water could taste so good.

19:25.540 --> 19:28.001
My throat was so dry,
| thought I wouldn't be able to talk.

19:28.126 --> 19:31.463
At least some good would've come from
the drought then.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.256
More?

19:35.925 --> 19:39.137
The sand's disappeared and water
returned to the well.

19:39.888 --> 19:41.639
It doesn't make any sense.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.642
(CLEARING THROAT)

19:44.726 --> 19:48.438
| suppose you have some
explanation for this, Merlin?

19:48.521 --> 19:49.689
Let's hear it.

19:50.315 --> 19:54.319
Anhora said you'd be tested.
And last night, in the grain store,

19:54.402 --> 19:55.695
you let that villager go.

19:55.779 --> 19:58.740
And he said it would
bring its own reward.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.950
He was just being grateful,
and so he should've been.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.912
Maybe that was your first test?
You passed it.

20:04.037 --> 20:08.666
So the curse has begun to lift.
Perhaps this is your reward.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.254
| know you don't have to listen to me.

20:13.338 --> 20:15.340
I'm glad we agree on something.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.885
If you're tested again, you have
a chance to end your people's suffering.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.471
| know you want that
more than anything.

20:24.641 --> 20:27.102
Perhaps we should seek Anhora out.

20:30.313 --> 20:33.817
| can't negotiate with sorcerers.
My father won't hear of it.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.069
Then it's probably best
you don't tell him.

20:40.573 --> 20:44.911
| must go check on the guard.
See if you can find me some food.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.665
Find some food.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.845
(CHANTING)

21:05.014 --> 21:06.391
(CHILD CRYING)

21:16.693 --> 21:18.820
Who are they?

21:18.903 --> 21:22.365
They've come from the outlying
villages in search of food.

21:23.074 --> 21:27.203
There's not enough rations
to feed the people who are already here.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.622
You shouldn't blame yourself.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.083
I'm sure you're doing
everything you can.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.586
It is not enough.

21:37.297 --> 21:40.175
Did you manage to find any food?

21:42.552 --> 21:43.803
Where did you get that?

21:43.887 --> 21:46.431
| was able to smuggle it out
of the palace kitchens.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.225
Share it amongst the children
and the old people.

21:49.309 --> 21:51.561
Make it go as far as you can.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.399
| have lost my appetite.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.694
-You have to eat something.
-I can't.

22:00.278 --> 22:02.363
Not while my people are starving.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.995
Do you really believe I am
responsible for the curse?

22:09.787 --> 22:11.122
I'm afraid so.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.669
We're going to the forest
first thing in the morning.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.964
Maybe we can pick up Anhora's trail.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.175
Whatever it takes.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.968
Okay, but you have to eat.

22:24.052 --> 22:27.388
You won't be able to help anyone
if you're too weak to pass the test.

22:40.693 --> 22:45.198
What kind of meat is this?
It has a very strange texture.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.075
It's pork.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.994
This isn't pork. It's far too stringy.

22:50.078 --> 22:52.413
What is it? It's...

22:57.043 --> 22:58.545
It's rat, isn't it?

23:00.421 --> 23:03.132
Try not to think about it.

23:06.636 --> 23:11.849
Look at me. I'm being rude.
Here I am stuffing my face

23:11.933 --> 23:16.354
with this delicious stew
when you're hungry, too.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.775
Come on.

23:21.818 --> 23:24.112
Take a seat.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.740
Eat.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.329
ARTHUR: Mmm.

23:43.756 --> 23:44.841
Mmm.

23:45.383 --> 23:49.929
-It's actually pretty tasty.
-Well, I'm glad you like I,

23:50.054 --> 23:51.431
because

23:54.517 --> 23:56.728
there's plenty more.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.396
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

23:58.605 --> 23:59.689
Enter.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.320
-Morgana?
-I hate to ask, but I was wondering

24:05.403 --> 24:06.946
if you had anything to eat?

24:15.330 --> 24:17.832
I'm not entirely sure
what I'm looking for.

24:17.915 --> 24:22.378
You're looking for footprints
or broken branches.

24:22.462 --> 24:26.132
Anything that would indicate
someone passed that...

24:26.424 --> 24:28.718
Merlin!

24:30.261 --> 24:33.014
Merlin! He's here!

24:37.226 --> 24:39.437
Arthur?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.295
You?

25:10.426 --> 25:12.136
You're a thief?

25:12.220 --> 25:14.514
Wasn't that obvious when you
caught me stealing your grain?

25:14.597 --> 25:17.016
You're fortunate I have more
important things to do than deal with...

25:17.100 --> 25:20.228
You didn't believe that story
about my children, did you?

25:21.062 --> 25:25.525
What kind of man lies about
starving children to save his own skin?

25:25.608 --> 25:29.445
Your people starve because
you let thieves steal their grain.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.156
-That's why they doubt you.
-You do not speak for my people.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.410
Your father would never have
allowed himself to be fooled like that.

25:35.493 --> 25:37.120
You hold your tongue,

25:37.203 --> 25:39.622
or I will make time
to teach you some manners.

25:39.706 --> 25:42.709
Your father would have had me executed.

25:42.792 --> 25:46.587
But you didn't have the stomach for I,
did you, Arthur?

25:46.671 --> 25:50.299
And that's why he doubts
you'll make a good king.

25:50.842 --> 25:53.177
You know nothing
of what my father thinks.

25:53.261 --> 25:55.805
| think he wishes he had another son,

25:55.888 --> 25:59.392
one who was worthy of taking his place.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.977
You shame him.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.105
Pick up your sword.

26:05.523 --> 26:09.402
The King must fear the day
when you will take the throne.

26:14.782 --> 26:19.203
He fears you do not have
enough strength to defeat his enemies.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.276
The King must wonder
if you are even his son.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.486
(GRUNTING)

27:06.167 --> 27:08.544
-This is your doing?
-It was a test to see

27:08.628 --> 27:12.548
-what is truly in your heart.
-Your tricks prove nothing.

27:13.132 --> 27:17.053
-Why did you Kill this man?
-He insulted my honor.

27:17.512 --> 27:20.181
You could have chosen
to ignore his taunts.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.433
What harm would they do you?

27:22.809 --> 27:26.729
-You will lift the curse, sorcerer.
-It is not in my power.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.440
Then you will die.

27:31.526 --> 27:34.695
Killing me will not help you.

27:37.532 --> 27:38.616
(GROANS)

27:39.492 --> 27:43.663
You have shown that you would Kill
a man to defend your pride.

27:43.746 --> 27:46.874
You have failed the test.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.502
For this, Camelot will pay dearly.

27:50.253 --> 27:54.006
-My people have done nothing.
-Your people's suffering

27:54.090 --> 27:57.552
is not my doing. It is yours.

28:05.101 --> 28:08.312
Arthur? Arthur?

28:10.231 --> 28:11.440
(PANTING)

28:15.945 --> 28:17.238
ARTHUR: What is it? What has happened?

28:17.321 --> 28:19.782
UTHER:
All our remaining supplies have rotted.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.742
Every last grain.

28:28.332 --> 28:31.127
| know Arthur's stubborn and pig-headed,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.838
and annoying
but he cares about his people

28:34.547 --> 28:37.049
more than he cares about himself.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.846
He will not forgive himself
for making his people suffer.

28:43.180 --> 28:46.475
You must make sure
he doesn't do anything rash.

28:46.934 --> 28:50.605
The mood he's in, I don't know
what he's going to do.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.195
-Ready?
-You're sure they're not poisonous?

28:58.279 --> 29:02.366
Quite certain.
They say they taste like chicken.

29:04.535 --> 29:08.497
Unless we are to starve,
we must hope they are right.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.597
This tastes nothing like chicken.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.107
There are some supplies left
in the palace stores.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.401
We are distributing them to the people,

29:37.485 --> 29:40.029
but there is not enough to live on.

29:42.156 --> 29:44.742
They will not survive for long.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.120
Then you must stop distributing food
to the people.

29:48.204 --> 29:50.665
They will starve.

29:50.748 --> 29:54.251
We must conserve the food we have
for our army.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.712
We cannot let our people
go without food...

29:56.796 --> 29:58.923
We must defend the kingdom at all costs.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.424
What's the point
of defending a kingdom...

30:00.508 --> 30:03.010
-What would you have me do?
-Where the people have starved to death!

30:03.844 --> 30:05.680
Ask the neighboring kingdoms for help.

30:05.763 --> 30:06.847
(SCOFFS)

30:06.931 --> 30:10.351
-They may be able to spare some food.
-Out of the question.

30:10.518 --> 30:12.103
As soon as they realize
how we weak we are,

30:12.186 --> 30:13.604
our enemies will strike against us.

30:13.688 --> 30:14.855
You don't know that for certain...

30:14.939 --> 30:17.650
I'd rather starve than beg
my enemies for help.

30:17.733 --> 30:21.112
What of our kingdom's reputation?
Have you no pride?

30:25.783 --> 30:29.912
| cannot think of my pride
when our people go hungry.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.749
They're all I can think of.

30:33.874 --> 30:37.211
Give the order to stop distributing
food to the people.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.714
Is that understood?

30:46.721 --> 30:49.974
You will have to give
that order yourself.

30:52.059 --> 30:56.772
Very well. But if you'd caught
the sorcerer, I wouldn't have to.

30:57.314 --> 30:59.775
That's your responsibility.

31:01.152 --> 31:04.989
One day you will understand
what it takes to be King.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.208
They don't yet know
that there is worse to come.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.627
What do you mean?

31:18.711 --> 31:23.174
My father is going to stop
distributing food to the people.

31:24.216 --> 31:29.013
They are to be left to starve.
| had a chance to lift the curse.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.850
And I have failed them.

31:33.017 --> 31:36.103
You weren't to know
you were being tested.

31:38.856 --> 31:41.233
My people are starving.

31:43.110 --> 31:46.072
Camelot is on the verge of collapse.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.910
And it is all my doing.

32:00.753 --> 32:01.921
Anhoral

32:02.004 --> 32:03.005
(ECHOING)

32:04.965 --> 32:07.343
Show yourself.

32:08.344 --> 32:10.930
Anhoral

32:16.018 --> 32:18.604
You wanted to talk with me?

32:19.146 --> 32:23.067
| have come to seek your help.
The people are starving.

32:23.484 --> 32:27.488
-They will soon be dead.
-You must believe me when I say,

32:27.696 --> 32:30.908
it gives me no pleasure
to see your people suffering.

32:30.991 --> 32:33.244
If it pains you, put an end to it.

32:33.327 --> 32:36.038
It is not in my power to lift the curse.

32:36.122 --> 32:38.332
Then give Arthur another chance.

32:38.415 --> 32:40.376
He has accepted it's his responsibility

32:40.459 --> 32:42.586
and he'll prove himself worthy
and lift the curse

32:42.670 --> 32:44.547
if you give him one more chance.

32:46.048 --> 32:47.716
You have faith in Arthur?

32:49.593 --> 32:51.095
| trust him with my life.

32:55.724 --> 32:59.103
Arthur must go
to the Labyrinth of Gedref.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.689
There he will face a final test.

33:02.022 --> 33:07.862
If he fails, there is no hope.
The curse will destroy Camelot.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.742
Wait!

33:15.077 --> 33:17.580
What kind of test will he face?

33:17.663 --> 33:21.709
That is for Arthur alone to discover.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.629
Let me come with you.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.339
You don't know
what form the test will take.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.550
- I might be able to help.
-You're not coming.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.010
| brought this curse upon Camelot.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.053
I'm gonna be the one to lift it,

33:33.220 --> 33:36.515
-or die trying.
-How does you dying help anyone?

33:36.974 --> 33:39.476
| will die knowing
| did everything I can.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.563
-I'm coming with you.
-Merlin, you are to stay here,

33:42.646 --> 33:46.525
and help the people as best you can.
Is that understood?

36:19.511 --> 36:21.680
You said Arthur would face a test.

36:21.764 --> 36:24.558
And here you are preparing
a trap for him.

36:24.641 --> 36:28.812
The trap isn't for Arthur.
It is for you.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.522
(CHANTS)

36:34.735 --> 36:36.028
(GRUNTS)

37:16.193 --> 37:18.237
Merlin?

37:18.320 --> 37:20.572
I'm sorry.

37:23.075 --> 37:25.828
Let him go. I will take your test,

37:26.495 --> 37:29.498
-but not till he's released.
-That is not possible.

37:29.581 --> 37:33.919
Merlin is a part of the test.
Please, sit.

37:37.005 --> 37:39.591
If you refuse the test,
you will have failed,

37:39.675 --> 37:42.678
and Camelot will be destroyed.

37:45.848 --> 37:48.934
| thought I told you to stay at home.

37:51.979 --> 37:53.272
Let's get on with it.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.483
There are two goblets before you.

37:57.985 --> 38:01.113
One of the goblets contains
a deadly poison,

38:01.196 --> 38:04.616
the other goblet, a harmless liquid.

38:05.534 --> 38:08.287
All the liquid from both goblets
must be drunk,

38:08.370 --> 38:12.833
but each of you may only drink
from a single goblet.

38:15.043 --> 38:18.297
What kind of ridiculous test is that?
What does it prove?

38:18.380 --> 38:23.051
What it proves is for you to decide.
If you pass the test,

38:23.135 --> 38:25.512
the curse will be lifted.

38:30.893 --> 38:33.395
Let's think about this.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.357
-What if I drink from my goblet first?
-If it's poisoned, you'll die.

38:37.483 --> 38:42.070
And if not, then you have to drink
from yours and you'll die.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.908
-There must be a way round it.
-It's perfectly simple.

38:46.033 --> 38:48.660
One of us has to die.

38:49.161 --> 38:52.915
We have to find a way to determine
which goblet has the poison.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.542
Then [I'll drink it.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.336
| will be the one to drink it.

38:57.419 --> 39:00.172
This is my doing. I'm drinking it.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.007
It is more important that you live.

39:02.090 --> 39:03.926
You're the future King.
I'm just a servant.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.845
It's no time to be a hero, Merlin.
It really doesn't suit you.

39:07.054 --> 39:08.222
(SIGHS)

39:09.598 --> 39:14.561
What if I drink from mine first,
and if that's not poisoned,

39:14.937 --> 39:17.105
| will then drink yours.

39:17.231 --> 39:21.944
He said each of us is only allowed
to drink from a single goblet.

39:27.199 --> 39:30.202
| had no idea you're so keen
to die for me.

39:30.285 --> 39:32.120
Trust me.
| can hardly believe it myself.

39:32.246 --> 39:33.455
(CHUCKLES)

39:36.792 --> 39:38.919
I'm glad you are here, Merlin.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.636
I've got it!

39:47.970 --> 39:49.888
We pour all the liquid into one goblet

39:49.972 --> 39:51.890
and then we can be sure it is poisoned.

39:51.974 --> 39:53.141
Then all the liquid can be drunk,

39:53.267 --> 39:55.185
and it will be from a single goblet.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.148
You never cease to surprise me.

40:00.274 --> 40:03.068
You are a lot smarter than you look.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.445
Is that actually a compliment?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.991
Look out!

40:09.116 --> 40:11.660
-No! I will drink it.
-As if I would let you.

40:11.785 --> 40:13.912
You can't die. This isn't your destiny.

40:13.996 --> 40:16.164
-It seems you're wrong again.
-Listen to me!

40:16.248 --> 40:20.168
You know me, Merlin.
| never listen to you.

40:20.669 --> 40:23.005
Arthur! No!

40:28.468 --> 40:31.013
What have you done?

40:35.017 --> 40:37.352
Arthur!

40:37.686 --> 40:40.022
No!

40:42.691 --> 40:45.485
Arthur. Arthur.

40:46.695 --> 40:48.780
Come on.

40:48.864 --> 40:52.367
Arthur, come on, come on, come on.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.625
No!

41:01.501 --> 41:04.171
Come on.

41:05.881 --> 41:07.382
Please!

41:07.466 --> 41:11.345
Please, let me take his place!

41:12.387 --> 41:15.223
This was Arthur's test, not yours.

41:16.308 --> 41:19.561
You have killed him.
| was meant to protect him.

41:20.729 --> 41:24.066
He's not dead. He's merely consumed
a sleeping draught.

41:24.191 --> 41:26.318
He will come round shortly.

41:28.195 --> 41:29.488
What?

41:29.988 --> 41:32.574
A unicorn is pure of heart.

41:33.408 --> 41:35.661
If you kill one,
you must make amends

41:35.744 --> 41:39.498
by proving that you also
are pure of heart.

41:41.249 --> 41:44.753
Arthur was willing to sacrifice his life
to save yours.

41:46.338 --> 41:50.884
He has proven
what is truly in his heart.

41:52.928 --> 41:55.347
The curse will be lifted.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.276
GAIUS: Merlin, Arthur!
There is good news.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.028
The crops are growing once again.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.280
They are bringing in the harvest.

42:12.364 --> 42:13.782
You did it.

42:14.741 --> 42:17.911
Is this your doing?
Is the sorcerer dead?

42:19.079 --> 42:22.124
-He won't be troubling us anymore.
-Good.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.794
Make sure our grain reserves
are restocked.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.214
| will see to it.

42:32.634 --> 42:34.803
There is something we must do first.

42:40.308 --> 42:43.061
| should never have ended your life.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.397
I'm sorry.

43:05.333 --> 43:07.669
Arthur.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.768
ANHORA:
When he who kills a unicorn

43:22.851 --> 43:25.854
proves himself to be pure of heart,

43:26.313 --> 43:30.192
the unicorn will live again.

43:34.696 --> 43:37.032
You didn't say anything about magic.
| don't want any trouble.

43:37.157 --> 43:39.242
Find him. You're under arrest.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.828
You execute Gwen's father
and I will never forgive you.

43:41.912 --> 43:44.664
Take care, child,
or I will have you restrained.

43:44.748 --> 43:48.668
-More than ever I want Uther dead.
-The deed is as good as done.

43:48.752 --> 43:52.088
Only if Uther dies will you be free,
Merlin.

43:52.214 --> 43:55.717
Wait, where does it say
my destiny includes murder?

43:55.842 --> 43:59.721
If you had the power of life and death
over Uther, would you kill him?
