- Two hundred? Isn't gambling illegal?

- Oh, yes.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.246
- Down. Down.
- Okay.

10:37.407 --> 10:39.204
I hope you don't feel this way
about chicks.

10:39.407 --> 10:41.875
I got one of those Sonics cheerleaders
coming on my show today,

10:42.047 --> 10:43.560
and she really wants to see you.

10:43.727 --> 10:46.400
Believe it or not, Bulldog,
not every man's dream woman

10:46.607 --> 10:49.565
is a pompom-shaking,
half-time halfwit.

10:49.767 --> 10:51.280
Is she the head cheerleader?

10:51.887 --> 10:54.481
Yeah, and she's coming in costume.

10:54.687 --> 10:57.042
Of course she is. It's radio.

11:00.287 --> 11:01.766
Look at these faxes
that came for you.

11:01.927 --> 11:03.599

11:04.327 --> 11:06.477
"Seattle thanks you."

11:07.487 --> 11:10.559
"You're the Sonics' MVP."

11:10.767 --> 11:12.883
- Most valuable player.
- Oh!

"You're a genius."

With the less-common J spelling.
But still, his point is well taken.

11:20.007 --> 11:22.077
I bet you're feeling pretty good
about yourself.

11:22.287 --> 11:24.642
Suddenly I'm being revered as a god
by the same troglodytes

11:24.807 --> 11:27.765
who in junior high school tried to
pack me into my own briefcase.

11:27.927 --> 11:29.724
It's glorious.

11:29.927 --> 11:31.758
Oh, I almost forgot the best part.

11:32.087 --> 11:35.124
Reggie sent these tickets
for tonight's game over.

11:35.527 --> 11:38.041
Well, I suppose I can't disappoint
my new fans.

11:38.207 --> 11:40.198
Tell me, does one still wear
a white sweater

to these things?

I'm not interrupting or anything, am I?

11:51.487 --> 11:53.717
- No, come in. Is everything all right?
- Oh, sure, sure.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.366
I was just having lunch at McGinty's,

11:55.607 --> 11:57.563
and some of the guys would
really like to meet you,

11:57.727 --> 12:00.446
and I was hoping that after your show,
you could stop in for a drink.

12:00.647 --> 12:04.083
I mean, I wouldn't ask you, but some
of these guys are my best buddies.

12:04.287 --> 12:06.755
Actually, Dad, Reggie sent over
these tickets to tonight's game,

12:06.927 --> 12:08.804
and I was going to ask you to go,
but since...

12:09.007 --> 12:11.441
The hell with those guys. I'm there.

12:12.047 --> 12:14.880
I have to tell you, I'm finding
all this attention a bit overwhelming.

12:15.087 --> 12:18.204
Oh, come on, you deserve it.
You're a hero.

12:18.407 --> 12:20.363
Perhaps it's time
we put all this into perspective.

12:20.527 --> 12:22.404
The only real heroes are
the fine athletes

12:22.567 --> 12:24.523
who worked so hard
for two hours to win that game.

12:24.687 --> 12:26.405
My contribution was minimal at best.

What did I tell you, doc?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.044
Which of you won the game

Reggie credited with last night's victory.

- Yeah, yeah, it's my son, Niles Crane.

12:57.207 --> 12:58.606
They must've sold too many tickets.

in these folding chairs.

Hi. Marty Crane. Niles' dad.

Yeah, I'm a big fan.

I want you to know,
I never lost faith in you.

Not when you were in your slump,
not when you tanked it in the playoffs,

13:44.247 --> 13:48.286
not even when all my friends
were calling you Reggie Hack-Lemore.

13:48.927 --> 13:50.280
What?

13:50.447 --> 13:51.846
You know, this might be
a good time

13:52.007 --> 13:54.123
to try that negative-thought-blocking
exercise.

13:54.287 --> 13:56.881
Yeah, okay. Look, you guys enjoy
the game. I'll see you afterwards.

the starting five in for the tip-off.

- Yeah.
- The imaging exercises?

What else did you tell me to do?

Nothing. Bulldog called you,
you ran back in.

I rubbed your head.

smelled like peach

does this guy wash his hair with?"

my head is some sort of lucky charm.

20:49.327 --> 20:50.840
You have to look at this logically.

20:51.007 --> 20:52.486
I can't come down here
for every game,

20:52.647 --> 20:55.002
and I certainly can't go with you
when the team is on tour.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.885
This is not a long-term solution.

20:57.087 --> 20:58.918
What you need is legitimate therapy.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.401
If you wanna start, come inside.

21:00.567 --> 21:03.400
I'll give you a quick session,
we can proceed from there.

21:03.727 --> 21:07.083
Yeah, you're right, doc. I mean,
what I need is a long-term solution.

21:07.287 --> 21:08.800
Good.

21:09.127 --> 21:11.163
Yo, Frank, let me see those scissors.

21:11.327 --> 21:13.238
Coming, doc.
