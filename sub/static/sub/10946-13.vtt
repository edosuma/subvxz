WEBVTT

00:00.368 --> 00:01.597
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.617 --> 00:04.305
- Ty: Do you love her?
- Wade: I love your mother very much.

00:04.339 --> 00:07.374
Okay.
Go back to Vancouver then...

00:07.409 --> 00:09.310
tell her I won't stand
in your way anymore.

00:09.344 --> 00:10.497
Georgie: You know the
Sadie Hawkins Dance?

00:10.517 --> 00:11.845
Well, are-are you going?

00:11.879 --> 00:13.680
Stephen: I don't know. Maybe.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.615
Georgie: So I was wondering um...
If you wanted to go with me?

00:15.650 --> 00:17.952
Stephen: Yes!

00:17.986 --> 00:20.287
I told Caleb I burned
his cheque,

00:20.322 --> 00:22.255
and he gave me this to make sure
that my money's safe

00:22.289 --> 00:25.391
in case the whole thing
with Jesse goes up in his face.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.328
Amy: What? Oh my...
(Money bundles clatter)

00:28.362 --> 00:31.099
What is your plan? What're
you gonna do with all this?

00:32.266 --> 00:35.301
(Birds chirp, hooves thud)

00:35.336 --> 00:36.937
Georgie: Okay, so you
wanna push with your leg

00:36.971 --> 00:38.871
and guide with the reins.

00:38.905 --> 00:40.273
Jade: You mean like this?

00:40.307 --> 00:42.775
Georgie: Yeah. That's good.

00:42.795 --> 00:44.910
Jade: Yeah, my mom's been
paying for private lessons.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.613
The post divorce generosity
continues.

00:47.647 --> 00:50.116
Georgie: Well, you're
getting really good.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.584
Jade: Yeah, well,
good's not good enough.

00:51.618 --> 00:53.486
I need to be great.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.721
- Georgie: Why?
- Jade: Because all the guys in my school

00:55.755 --> 00:57.890
are like serious cowboys.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.459
They're only into horsy girls.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.395
Like this guy in my homeroom,
Matt Smith.

01:03.429 --> 01:06.158
Of course he doesn't even know
I'm alive.

01:06.178 --> 01:09.034
Georgie: Okay, well, you should take
riding lessons because you love them,

01:09.068 --> 01:11.636
not because you wanna
impress some guy.

01:11.670 --> 01:14.506
Yeah, well, I bet you'll wanna
impress Stephen at the dance.

01:14.540 --> 01:16.308
You probably even bought
a new dress and everything.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.610
Actually, I haven't thought
one bit about that.

01:18.644 --> 01:20.212
Well, you better start.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.847
It's a Sadie Hawkins Dance,
not a hoedown.

01:22.882 --> 01:25.017
Baggy jeans and a plaid shirt
just aren't gonna cut it.

01:25.051 --> 01:26.818
Georgie: (Sighs heavily)

01:26.852 --> 01:30.454
Amy: So Lou wants us to pick
the type of paper, the font,

01:30.489 --> 01:34.158
and if we want it embossed
or debossed.

01:34.192 --> 01:36.394
Ty: Debossed? Is
that even a word?

01:36.428 --> 01:38.863
Lisa: Yeah, yeah. Yup.

01:38.898 --> 01:42.500
Embossed is when the pattern is
raised against the background,

01:42.535 --> 01:45.169
and debossed is when it's...
Sunk into the back of the paper.

01:45.203 --> 01:46.770
- Amy: Oh.
- Ty: Oh...

01:46.804 --> 01:49.140
- Uh, thanks, Lisa.
- Lisa: Anytime.

01:49.174 --> 01:50.541
You know what, Amy?
I'm... I'm really...

01:50.575 --> 01:52.309
I'm good either way,
so you pick the one you like.

01:52.344 --> 01:55.546
Don't you make me decide,
please?

01:55.580 --> 01:56.914
Okay, well, why don't we go
with something simple then?

01:56.948 --> 01:58.449
Amy: Okay. Like this one.

01:58.483 --> 01:59.683
Ty: Yeah, that one works for me.

01:59.717 --> 02:01.384
- Amy: Okay, me too.
- Ty: Done.

02:01.419 --> 02:02.600
Lisa: don't you wanna
sort of think about it

02:02.620 --> 02:04.187
and give it a little more time?

02:04.221 --> 02:06.489
I mean, the invitation sets
the tone for the entire wedding.

02:06.524 --> 02:09.192
(Inhales deeply) It's important.

02:09.226 --> 02:11.494
Amy: I'm good if you're good.

02:11.529 --> 02:13.263
Ty:
Yeah, I'm-I'm good with this.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.599
Well, if you're good then...
You're good. Good.

02:15.633 --> 02:16.934
- Amy: Hi, grandpa.
- Jack: Good morning.

02:16.968 --> 02:18.901
Hey, I've got some mail here
for you guys.

02:18.936 --> 02:21.904
Looks like the "save the date"
you sent to Lily and Wade

02:21.939 --> 02:24.127
says "return to sender."

02:26.977 --> 02:28.844
- Casey: A little help here?
- Tim: Hmm?

02:28.879 --> 02:32.048
Casey: (Chuckles) A little help?

02:32.083 --> 02:34.650
Hey, are you okay?

02:34.685 --> 02:38.754
Tim: Yeah. I ju-I just can't
stop thinking about that kid

02:38.789 --> 02:41.791
that was injured at
the pincher creek rodeo.

02:41.825 --> 02:43.325
You know, the way that horse
was dragging him around,

02:43.359 --> 02:46.295
he's gonna be in the hospital
for weeks.

02:46.329 --> 02:50.466
Well, that's the risk
these guys take, right?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.335
Tim: Well, risk is one thing.

02:53.369 --> 02:56.472
That kid had no business
being in that ring.

02:56.506 --> 02:58.673
They just... they need
to learn the basics.

02:58.708 --> 03:00.775
Ungh! (Bag thuds)

03:00.810 --> 03:02.444
Like spurring. (Door bangs shut)

03:02.479 --> 03:05.481
You know... Measuring your rein.

03:05.515 --> 03:07.782
I-I-I don't know...

03:07.817 --> 03:12.954
I'm just so tired of seeing them
almost kill themselves out there.

03:12.989 --> 03:15.023
Casey: Well, maybe they should
be mentored by a real cowboy

03:15.057 --> 03:16.658
with real rodeo experience.

03:16.692 --> 03:19.027
Tim: Yeah. Somebody like that.
(Jug thumps)

03:19.061 --> 03:22.230
Casey:
Somebody like you... maybe?

03:22.264 --> 03:23.464
Well... I don't know...
I don't know about that.

03:23.499 --> 03:26.066
Come on, I'm serious.

03:26.101 --> 03:28.469
You spent your half your life
out on that circuit.

03:28.504 --> 03:29.803
You almost lost the other half
in a bulldogging wreck.

03:29.838 --> 03:31.705
You have a lot to teach
these guys.

03:31.740 --> 03:35.676
Yeah, I tried teaching once...
little kids.

03:35.710 --> 03:39.079
Uh... sheep, and the parents,
and the...

03:39.114 --> 03:40.848
I don't have the patience.

03:40.882 --> 03:42.116
Well, I have a lot
of connections

03:42.150 --> 03:45.085
at the high school
rodeo association.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.588
One phone call,
I could get you some students.

03:48.623 --> 03:51.925
Just think about it.
You have a lot to offer.

03:55.997 --> 03:58.298
(Sighs, clucks her tongue)

03:58.332 --> 04:00.933
(Sample boards thump)

04:00.968 --> 04:02.536
- Jack: I know what you're up to.
- Lisa: What?

04:02.570 --> 04:04.638
You are like a...

04:04.672 --> 04:07.274
a wedding planning lioness
ready to pounce.

04:07.308 --> 04:09.909
No. No. That's not true.

04:09.943 --> 04:11.844
I-I promised I wouldn't get
involved unless Amy asked me to,

04:11.879 --> 04:14.346
and I am keeping my promise.

04:14.381 --> 04:17.116
- Jack: Good.
- Lisa: So I'm sitting here, quietly,

04:17.151 --> 04:19.317
while she struggles
with every little detail...

04:19.351 --> 04:21.019
details that I could
easily handle...

04:21.055 --> 04:26.414
but no, no,
I am... being quiet... for you.

04:27.394 --> 04:29.761
My mom's cell is no longer
in service.

04:29.796 --> 04:31.830
Same with her land line.

04:31.864 --> 04:33.232
I got a bad feeling
about this Amy.

04:33.266 --> 04:35.801
Amy: Okay, okay, yup.

04:35.835 --> 04:37.135
No.
I appreciate the information.

04:37.170 --> 04:40.105
Thank you. (Phone beeps off)

04:40.139 --> 04:43.209
Well, that was Paladin Transport
in Vancouver.

04:43.243 --> 04:45.611
Your stepdad's still working
for them, but not there.

04:45.645 --> 04:49.081
He's back in Hudson.

04:49.115 --> 04:50.348
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

04:53.786 --> 04:56.788
Amy: You okay?
Ty: (Shaky sigh)

04:56.823 --> 04:58.656
Yeah. Let's go. (Doors open)

05:01.894 --> 05:04.061
(Doors bang shut,
tools buzz and whir)

05:06.365 --> 05:08.499
Hey, Ty, look,
I-I was gonna call you.

05:08.534 --> 05:11.669
Ty: Where is she?

05:11.704 --> 05:13.644
Wade: Is that any way to say
hello to your old stepdad?

05:13.664 --> 05:15.087
Where is she, Wade?

05:15.107 --> 05:16.907
Your mom, she's fine.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.643
That's not what I asked.

05:18.677 --> 05:21.545
She's safe.
That's all you need to know.

05:21.579 --> 05:23.714
(Struggling grunts)
Amy: Ty, don't!

05:23.749 --> 05:25.049
Ty: Tell me where she is!

05:25.083 --> 05:27.017
Here we go again, huh?

05:27.052 --> 05:29.186
Ungh! You better start talking
right now!

05:29.221 --> 05:31.142
She doesn't want you to know...

05:31.162 --> 05:33.457
Know what?!

05:33.491 --> 05:39.585
She's been drinking again.
She's in rehab.

If I find out
he had anything to do

06:30.313 --> 06:33.182
with my mom drinking again...
I'll kill him.

06:36.953 --> 06:38.220
(Opens door) I'll be right back.

06:38.254 --> 06:40.022
- Ty: Where are you going?

06:40.056 --> 06:43.725
Ty: Hey! (Door bangs shut)

06:43.759 --> 06:46.994
(On phone) Gonna test her out today.
Yup. Okay. Bye, bye.

06:47.029 --> 06:49.397
(Tools buzz and whir)

06:49.432 --> 06:52.391
Ty's cooling off in the truck.

06:53.202 --> 06:54.969
I knew he was gonna blame me
for this.

06:55.003 --> 06:57.584
What happened, Wade?

06:59.107 --> 07:01.342
She was doing really well,
right?

07:01.376 --> 07:03.911
But I guess uh... old wounds,

07:03.946 --> 07:06.380
they got a way
of opening up again.

07:06.414 --> 07:08.301
It's like one day she swam out
into the middle of the ocean

07:08.321 --> 07:10.927
and couldn't find her way back.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.520
Checked her into the best rehab
on the west coast...

07:13.555 --> 07:16.289
at least that's what
the brochure said.

07:16.324 --> 07:18.225
And uh... well, they don't allow
visitors right away,

07:18.259 --> 07:20.160
so I-I thought I'd come up here,

07:20.194 --> 07:22.496
make a little extra money.

07:22.530 --> 07:25.332
Everything you just told me,
you should've told Ty.

07:25.367 --> 07:27.899
Lily didn't wanna burden him
with it.

07:29.337 --> 07:30.704
Neither did I.

07:30.739 --> 07:33.106
He has a hard time trusting you.

07:33.140 --> 07:34.674
Secrets are only gonna
make it worse.

07:34.708 --> 07:38.011
Yeah. Yeah.

07:38.045 --> 07:39.412
(Sighs heavily)

07:42.016 --> 07:44.756
We tried to send you this,
it got sent back.

07:44.776 --> 07:45.618
It did?

07:45.652 --> 07:47.620
It's the "save the date"
to our wedding.

07:50.991 --> 07:52.692
Finally decided to say yes, huh?

07:52.726 --> 07:55.194
Yeah, I did.

07:55.228 --> 07:58.163
- Wade: Congratulations.
- Amy: Thank you.

07:58.198 --> 07:59.499
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

08:01.468 --> 08:05.204
(Rain patters)

08:05.438 --> 08:11.524
Hey, Ty, I understand why
you're upset, I do.

08:11.544 --> 08:14.646
Wade should've told you
about your mom.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.082
But... the way I see it,
you both want the same thing.

08:17.117 --> 08:19.384
For-for Lily to be better.

08:19.419 --> 08:20.552
Ty: Half the things that
come out of Wade's mouth

08:20.587 --> 08:23.517
are pure fiction, Amy, so...

08:24.423 --> 08:27.692
I don't know, I just...
It seemed like he was hurting.

08:27.727 --> 08:30.695
Ty: (Amused chuckle) Well...

08:30.730 --> 08:32.597
Maybe some human part of him
feels bad

08:32.631 --> 08:36.366
for pushing my mom to the edge.
Again.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.202
Or maybe it was just an act.
He's really good at that.

08:38.236 --> 08:40.837
No. It... it didn't seem
like an act to me.

08:40.871 --> 08:45.776
Amy, honestly, I don't wanna
get you mixed up in this, okay?

08:45.810 --> 08:47.512
- Amy: Okay.
- Ty: Thank you.

08:47.546 --> 08:50.381
(Door opens)

08:50.415 --> 08:53.984
He's at the Hudson Motor Motel.
Room 103.

08:54.019 --> 08:56.120
Just thought you should know.
(Door bangs shut)

08:56.154 --> 08:58.122
(Rain patters)

09:00.324 --> 09:02.726
(Truck rumbles away)

09:04.996 --> 09:06.830
Lisa: 'Kay.

09:06.865 --> 09:08.832
- Tim: Lisa!
- Amy: Wow!

09:08.867 --> 09:10.333
Tim: Wow, you have
really outdone yourself!

09:10.368 --> 09:11.834
Lisa: Oh no, no, it's nothing.

09:11.869 --> 09:16.406
It's just uh...
A medium rare beef tenderloin

09:16.440 --> 09:18.608
and some fingerling potatoes,
Swiss chard,

09:18.643 --> 09:21.711
some grilled zucchini and
a nice caramelized onion puree,

09:21.745 --> 09:23.946
and then a... red wine jus
around, so.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.848
Jade: Do you guys eat
like this everyday?

09:25.883 --> 09:29.485
Lisa: No. No, actually, I found
this really wonderful website

09:29.519 --> 09:32.221
that has wedding meals on it
and they had the recipes.

09:32.255 --> 09:33.255
I don't know,
we'll give it a shot

09:33.290 --> 09:35.158
and see what... you think...

09:35.192 --> 09:37.827
do you um...
Have you thought at all about...

09:37.861 --> 09:40.329
what you wanna serve
to everybody at the wedding?

09:40.363 --> 09:43.132
Amy: No. Um... I haven't
even picked a venue yet.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.168
Tim: Best wedding I was ever
at, they served beef on a bun.

09:46.203 --> 09:49.104
- Amy: That's a good idea.
- Lisa: (Spits her wine) So-I'm sorry.

09:49.138 --> 09:51.273
Jack: (Chuckles)
Lisa: Excuse me.

09:51.308 --> 09:53.041
- Jack: Are you okay?
- Lisa: Yes, thank you.

09:53.076 --> 09:54.743
Tim: So I have some news.

09:54.777 --> 09:56.378
I have decided that
it's time for me

09:56.413 --> 09:59.548
to give back to the rodeo world,

09:59.583 --> 10:01.516
and I thought what better way
to do that

10:01.550 --> 10:04.786
than to mentor
the young champions of tomorrow.

10:04.821 --> 10:08.389
So I'm starting a rodeo school
right here in Hudson.

10:08.424 --> 10:10.325
Jack, I know what you're
thinking. You're thinking,

10:10.359 --> 10:12.493
you shouldn't be mentoring
anybody on anything,

10:12.528 --> 10:14.495
but, you know, I really believe

10:14.530 --> 10:16.464
that I actually have something
to give these kids.

10:16.498 --> 10:19.018
I agree.

10:19.038 --> 10:19.862
Tim: You do?

10:19.882 --> 10:24.572
Jack: The best and
worst part of your life was rodeo.

10:24.607 --> 10:26.708
They need to see it from both
sides without the sugar coating.

10:26.742 --> 10:29.477
You're the guy to do that.
I support this.

10:29.511 --> 10:32.447
Thanks, buddy. That means a lot.

10:32.481 --> 10:34.115
Jack: Plus, those kids
are gonna eat you alive

10:34.149 --> 10:36.416
and I definitely support that.

10:36.451 --> 10:38.152
There it is... Thank you.

10:38.186 --> 10:39.653
Amy: If you need a
hand, let me know.

10:39.687 --> 10:42.556
Well, thanks, honey, but Caleb
and Casey are gonna help me.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.625
Amy: Caleb, huh? How did
you manage that one?

10:44.659 --> 10:46.493
Tim: Well, he's not
gonna do it for free,

10:46.527 --> 10:48.562
but I really need him because
I've already got two young guys

10:48.596 --> 10:51.598
signed up for bronc lessons
tomorrow, so.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.635
The one kid is a... Matt Smith.

10:54.669 --> 10:56.169
He's... he's got some potential.

10:56.203 --> 10:58.372
Matt Smith?
Yeah, he's in my class.

10:58.406 --> 11:00.440
I hear he's a really good
bronc rider.

11:00.475 --> 11:02.695
Tim: He's a rank amateur, but...
By the time I'm done with him,

11:02.715 --> 11:04.973
he might win a couple buckles.

11:07.748 --> 11:10.225
It's not beef on a bun.

11:11.786 --> 11:13.653
Amy:
Hey, what's going on up here?

11:13.687 --> 11:16.256
Georgie: Well, I need a
vintage country dress

11:16.290 --> 11:18.591
for the Sadie Hawkins Dance
at my school.

11:18.625 --> 11:19.993
I thought there must be
something here in the attic.

11:20.027 --> 11:21.460
Do you want a hand?

11:21.495 --> 11:22.695
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.

11:22.729 --> 11:24.096
Okay.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.566
(Sighs)

11:27.601 --> 11:29.635
(Items rustle)

11:31.938 --> 11:34.307
(Tissue paper crinkles)

11:39.012 --> 11:41.313
(Paper crinkles)

11:47.954 --> 11:51.290
Whoa! Whose dress is that?

11:51.324 --> 11:53.625
It was my mom's wedding dress.

11:54.157 --> 11:56.428
I've seen her in it in photos.

11:56.695 --> 11:58.493
I didn't know it was up here.

11:58.513 --> 12:00.046
Wow.

12:01.466 --> 12:03.768
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

12:07.806 --> 12:09.974
(Train passes in the distance,
door opens)

12:13.077 --> 12:14.512
(Door bangs shut)

12:18.316 --> 12:20.484
(Traffic rumbles by)

12:22.220 --> 12:24.321
(Banging on door)

12:24.356 --> 12:25.556
Hank: Can I help you?

12:27.859 --> 12:29.993
No. I'm just...
I'm just looking for somebody.

12:30.028 --> 12:31.695
Well, I work at the front desk,

12:31.729 --> 12:33.897
if you want to leave a message.

12:33.931 --> 12:35.331
Ty: That's okay. I'll just...

12:35.366 --> 12:37.267
come back tomorrow evening.

12:37.301 --> 12:40.236
Well, if you are looking for the
guy in room 103, don't bother.

12:40.271 --> 12:42.172
He's usually out all night

12:42.206 --> 12:44.851
and doesn't come back
until the morning.

12:47.943 --> 12:50.138
(Sighs heavily) Thanks.

12:52.061 --> 12:54.083
(Truck door opens)

12:54.117 --> 12:55.285
Tim: All right. The first
thing you gotta do

12:55.319 --> 12:57.720
is ask yourself why you're here.

12:57.754 --> 12:59.889
Are you here
because you wanna ride a bronc

12:59.923 --> 13:03.092
or say you rode a bronc, or are
you here to impress a girl?

13:03.126 --> 13:06.978
Or are you here
to be bronc riding champions?

13:07.430 --> 13:09.031
Because if you are,
I can guarantee

13:09.066 --> 13:13.202
that you're gonna be in...
for a world of pain.

13:13.236 --> 13:15.604
You're gonna spend more time in
the dirt than you are on a horse.

13:15.638 --> 13:18.007
And just when you think that
you can't take it anymore,

13:18.041 --> 13:20.975
you're gonna find out that
you're just getting started.

13:21.010 --> 13:22.678
Jade: Sorry I'm late, Mr. Fleming.
(Gate clangs closed)

13:22.712 --> 13:24.746
I hope I didn't miss anything
too important.

13:24.780 --> 13:26.415
Hey.

13:26.449 --> 13:28.283
Matt: What's up?

13:28.318 --> 13:30.852
Tim:
Jade, what're you doing here?

13:30.886 --> 13:32.254
Jade:
This is rodeo school, right?

13:32.288 --> 13:34.556
Tim: Yup. Yeah, these
boys are in training,

13:34.591 --> 13:36.991
so no spectators.

13:37.026 --> 13:38.459
Well, I'm not here to watch. I'm
here to learn how to ride a bronc.

13:38.493 --> 13:40.095
Tim: This rodeo school.

13:40.129 --> 13:41.830
'Kay, we're not messing
around here.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.331
What, you don't think a girl
can ride a bronc?

13:43.365 --> 13:45.499
I didn't... I didn't say that.

13:45.534 --> 13:48.369
That's not very progressive
of you, Mr. Fleming.

13:48.403 --> 13:50.021
Tim: Okay.

13:52.000 --> 13:58.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

14:05.612 --> 14:08.014
Wade: Come to finish the job?

14:08.049 --> 14:10.183
I came to see you last night.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.584
Guy at the front desk
said you go out every night

14:11.618 --> 14:12.846
and you don't come back
until morning.

14:12.866 --> 14:15.120
- Wade: So?
- Ty: So?

14:15.155 --> 14:16.989
When I was kid,
you would stay out all night,

14:17.023 --> 14:19.091
then come home looking like
something the cat dragged in.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.093
- Wade: Come on.
- Ty: Sort of the way you look now.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.662
Mom would always ask
where you were,

14:22.696 --> 14:24.650
but she already knew the answer.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.699
You were out gambling and spending the
last of her hard-earned paycheque

14:26.733 --> 14:28.901
on cheap beer.

14:28.935 --> 14:30.602
Why is it every time you
and I run into each other

14:30.636 --> 14:32.404
you gotta bring up
ancient history?

14:32.438 --> 14:34.639
Well, it seems like history's
repeating itself.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.809
Mom's back in rehab, isn't she?

14:36.843 --> 14:38.577
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.179
- Ty: Really?
- Wade: Really.

14:40.213 --> 14:44.382
- Ty: Oh.
- Wade: This has been a real treat. Yeah.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.651
Thanks for stopping by.
I'd love to stay and chat,

14:46.686 --> 14:49.801
I got a shift at Paladin.

14:49.821 --> 14:52.657
Ty: You're the reason she started
drinking in the first place!

14:52.692 --> 14:54.559
You know that? She couldn't stand
you watch and ruin everything,

14:54.594 --> 14:55.827
and now you're doing it again!

14:55.861 --> 14:57.729
(Door slams shut, keys clank)

14:57.763 --> 15:01.235
Tim:
So, gentlemen... and ladies,

15:03.301 --> 15:06.708
let me introduce you
to "the mighty bronc."

15:07.539 --> 15:09.807
A bucking machine? You serious?

15:09.842 --> 15:11.508
I thought we were here
to ride a real bronc.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.377
You are,
but you're not ready yet.

15:13.411 --> 15:15.346
Matt: Riley and I have both
ridden on broncs before.

15:15.380 --> 15:18.716
No, you and Riley have both sat on
a bronc until it bucked you off.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.917
I know you think you're hotshots,
but you got a lot to learn.

15:20.952 --> 15:23.454
That's why you're here, right?
Caleb, nice of you to join us.

15:23.488 --> 15:25.155
Caleb: Sorry, had a few
things to take care of.

15:25.189 --> 15:27.558
Yeah, I'll dock it off your pay.

15:27.592 --> 15:30.196
All right, Riley, you're up.

15:32.196 --> 15:35.132
(Bucking machine clanks
and thumps)

15:35.166 --> 15:37.567
Tim: Okay, get your toes out...

15:37.601 --> 15:39.169
When you're spur...

15:39.203 --> 15:41.537
toes out when you spur forward,
okay?

15:41.572 --> 15:42.906
Harder! (Claps hands)

15:42.940 --> 15:44.808
Faster, Caleb, come on.

15:44.842 --> 15:47.010
(Caleb grunts,
bucking machine thumps)

15:47.044 --> 15:50.313
Tim: Stop flopping around
like a fish out of water.

15:50.347 --> 15:52.615
Okay, okay, okay. Hold, hold
that's-that's good.

15:52.650 --> 15:55.285
Matt.

15:55.319 --> 15:58.821
(Matt and Caleb grunt,
bucking machine thumps)

15:58.855 --> 16:02.925
Tim: Okay, you're never gonna get a
good spurring motion like that, Matt.

16:02.959 --> 16:06.228
Are-are you on a bronc
or a sheep right now?

16:06.263 --> 16:08.831
Move-move your feet faster.
Kick! You gotta have quick feet.

16:08.865 --> 16:11.267
Quick feet!

16:11.301 --> 16:13.102
(Bucking machine clanks,
Caleb grunts with effort)

16:13.136 --> 16:15.604
Okay, okay, that's enough.
That's good.

16:16.472 --> 16:18.060
Jade.

16:18.541 --> 16:21.443
Caleb: (Panting)

16:21.477 --> 16:23.312
You want a leg up?

16:23.346 --> 16:25.146
Tim: Caleb, what're you doing?
No, hold it.

16:25.181 --> 16:28.650
She can get up on her own
like everybody else.

16:28.685 --> 16:30.218
Matt and Riley: (Snicker)
Tim: Quick feet.

16:30.252 --> 16:31.953
Tim: What is so funny?
Is something funny?

16:31.987 --> 16:33.689
I didn't think anything
was funny.

16:33.723 --> 16:35.123
(Bucking machine thumps)

16:35.157 --> 16:37.693
Tim: Let's see what you got.

16:37.727 --> 16:40.028
That's good.

16:40.062 --> 16:42.897
Tuck your chin in!
Stay focused at the front.

16:42.932 --> 16:45.499
Keep your toes out.
Keep your toes out!

16:45.534 --> 16:49.170
Faster, Caleb, come on! Come on.

16:49.205 --> 16:52.473
Toes out! 'Kay, toes... out!

16:52.507 --> 16:54.843
(Bucking machine thumps)

16:58.413 --> 17:00.214
Tim: That's it, that's it.
That's it!

17:00.248 --> 17:01.882
She's not half bad.
She's as good as you two.

17:01.916 --> 17:04.184
(Bucking machine clanks)

17:06.253 --> 17:07.837
Tim: Toes out!

17:10.224 --> 17:13.060
(Birds chirp outside,
approaching footsteps)

17:13.094 --> 17:16.529
Lisa: Oh... wow. So
many beautiful ones.

17:16.564 --> 17:18.531
How are you ever gonna
make a decision?

17:18.566 --> 17:21.800
Amy: I don't know. Lou is
way better at this than me.

17:21.836 --> 17:24.271
When she gets back, I'll just ask
her to pick the flowers she likes.

17:24.305 --> 17:28.108
Lisa: Wha-wait! What she likes?
No, this is your wedding day.

17:28.142 --> 17:30.143
I mean...
It's a very personal choice

17:30.178 --> 17:31.778
and you sort of
have to make sure

17:31.812 --> 17:33.513
that it matches
your personal colour scheme.

17:33.547 --> 17:34.981
Amy:
I don't have a colour scheme.

17:35.015 --> 17:37.216
Lisa: Oh... well,

17:37.251 --> 17:39.886
that might be something you wanna...
start thinking about.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.954
Jack: (Clears his throat)
Lisa: But you know...

17:41.989 --> 17:44.090
Lou has impeccable taste

17:44.124 --> 17:47.593
and I'm sure she will pick
just the right flowers for you.

17:47.627 --> 17:49.795
Amy: Okay, well, I better get to work.
Bye, grandpa.

17:49.829 --> 17:51.297
Have a good day.

17:53.633 --> 17:56.369
(Door opens and closes)

17:58.338 --> 18:01.473
This is ridiculous.

18:01.508 --> 18:04.175
I'm trying so hard to honour
this promise that I made to you

18:04.210 --> 18:06.256
but, Jack, the circumstances
have changed.

18:06.276 --> 18:08.213
Lou's not here,

18:08.247 --> 18:11.784
Amy seems to not be able to make a
decision to save her life and...

18:11.818 --> 18:14.620
Honestly, I think she's being kinda
complacent about the whole thing.

18:14.654 --> 18:16.955
I'm telling you, things have
to be planned in proper order.

18:16.989 --> 18:19.357
Otherwise, she'll have
a meltdown on her wedding day.

18:19.392 --> 18:21.626
Well, you might be right.

18:22.524 --> 18:24.055
Really?

18:24.075 --> 18:27.299
I think Amy misses Lou,

18:27.333 --> 18:31.536
especially when it comes
to all this wedding stuff.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.671
Maybe she could use your help.

18:33.705 --> 18:36.468
But I only have one request.

18:36.488 --> 18:38.309
Yes. Anything.

18:38.343 --> 18:41.045
Please... talk to her

18:41.079 --> 18:43.147
before you start taking over
everything.

18:43.181 --> 18:45.716
I will ask her
and if she says no,

18:45.751 --> 18:50.120
then fine,
at least I-I tried. So...

18:50.155 --> 18:52.122
Tim: All right, we're gonna
give "the mighty bronc" a rest.

18:52.157 --> 18:53.958
We're gonna move on to step two.

18:53.992 --> 18:54.959
You guys are gonna come out
of the chute

18:54.993 --> 18:57.227
on this nice,
gentle saddle horse,

18:57.262 --> 18:59.729
but I want you to pretend
it's a real bronc, okay?

18:59.764 --> 19:00.864
When you're ride out
in the arena,

19:00.898 --> 19:03.515
I want you to practice
your spurring.

19:03.701 --> 19:04.969
And after eight seconds,

19:05.003 --> 19:08.198
Caleb's gonna swing by
and practice the pick up.

19:08.218 --> 19:09.639
You ready, Riley?

19:09.674 --> 19:11.174
Okay, Todd.
(Chute gate clangs open)

19:11.208 --> 19:13.677
(Horse grunts)

19:13.711 --> 19:17.046
Tim: Okay, feet forward.

19:17.081 --> 19:19.415
Hold your feet.
Get your feet out front.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.017
Pull up on your reins.

19:21.051 --> 19:23.753
See, you're losing your balance
in the saddle.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.922
You gotta tighten up.
Toes out, buddy.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.824
Come on, is that the best
you can do?

19:28.859 --> 19:30.559
Put him out of his misery.

19:30.594 --> 19:34.163
(Horses grunt)

19:34.198 --> 19:36.899
This rodeo school's pretty lame.

19:36.933 --> 19:39.002
It's like Tim thinks we've never
been on a horse before.

19:39.036 --> 19:41.770
Yeah, it's like...
worse than gym class.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.672
Hey, listen. Um...

19:43.707 --> 19:45.708
Riley and I are gonna go see
if there's um...

19:45.742 --> 19:47.376
a party somewhere
that we can crash tonight.

19:47.410 --> 19:48.811
You down to come?

19:48.845 --> 19:50.613
Sure. That'd be great.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.515
Okay. Why don't we meet
at... Maggie's.

19:52.549 --> 19:53.949
Say around nine o'clock.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.317
Yeah, I'll be there.

19:58.287 --> 19:59.554
Caleb: You know, the guys are
getting pretty discouraged.

19:59.588 --> 20:00.822
Maybe you could ease up a bit.

20:00.856 --> 20:02.190
(Horse grunts) Whoa.

20:05.861 --> 20:07.695
This is supposed to be fun,
after all.

20:07.730 --> 20:09.364
Tim: Fun?! What do you-what is this?
A carnival ride?

20:09.399 --> 20:12.267
I'm trying to teach these guys
something.

20:12.301 --> 20:13.502
Can we at least call it a day?

20:13.536 --> 20:16.170
Never mind them, I'm exhausted.

20:16.204 --> 20:19.373
Tim: Oh... are ya?

20:19.408 --> 20:21.442
Okay, that's it, everybody.

20:21.476 --> 20:22.977
Go home.
Get a good night's sleep

20:23.012 --> 20:24.646
'cause it's gonna be
a lot tougher tomorrow!

20:24.680 --> 20:26.399
Matt: (Mutters) Let's go.

20:27.727 --> 20:31.586
Caleb: If you keep yelling at them,
they're never gonna listen to you.

20:31.620 --> 20:33.487
I'm not trying to be
hard on them.

20:33.522 --> 20:35.322
I'm trying to get them
to take this seriously

20:35.357 --> 20:37.858
because bronc riding
can be life or death.

20:37.892 --> 20:39.260
You of all people
should know that.

20:39.294 --> 20:40.661
They don't seem to know that.

20:40.695 --> 20:42.196
Yeah, and they will get it,
eventually.

20:42.230 --> 20:44.607
But you gotta get them
on your side.

20:44.980 --> 20:47.734
Tomorrow, why don't we bring in
a practice bronc.

20:47.769 --> 20:49.002
I'm not saying that
they're ready to ride yet,

20:49.037 --> 20:50.503
but I could give them
a demonstration.

20:50.538 --> 20:52.338
It'll be something to aspire to.

20:52.373 --> 20:53.974
And you can show off, you can show off.
That's what you wanna do.

20:54.008 --> 20:55.542
Okay. Never mind.

20:59.146 --> 21:01.381
Okay. We'll do
the demonstration.

21:01.415 --> 21:03.349
- Caleb: Yeah?
- Tim: Yeah.

21:03.384 --> 21:04.517
- Caleb: Yes, we will.
- Tim: Okay.

21:04.552 --> 21:06.319
So I'll see you tomorrow.

21:06.353 --> 21:09.122
Thanks for today.

21:09.156 --> 21:11.724
And don't... be late.

21:11.758 --> 21:15.495
(Motel door opens
and bangs shut)

21:15.529 --> 21:17.964
(Keys jingle
as Wade walks to his car)

21:17.998 --> 21:19.832
Amy: Are you sure
this is a good idea?

21:19.866 --> 21:22.702
Ty: I gotta find out where
he's going at night.

21:22.736 --> 21:24.870
(Door bangs shut, engine starts)

21:26.974 --> 21:28.941
(Vehicle pulls out)

21:37.584 --> 21:39.951
(Vehicle accelerates away)

21:39.986 --> 21:41.686
(Truck engine starts)

21:41.721 --> 21:44.389
(Crickets chirp outside)

21:44.424 --> 21:46.625
(Footsteps creak
coming up the stairs)

21:55.601 --> 21:57.769
Georgie: What do you think?

21:57.803 --> 22:00.204
Jack: Well, for a
second there, I...

22:00.239 --> 22:02.206
Thought I saw Lyndy standing
right here in this room.

22:02.241 --> 22:04.175
That was her dress.

22:04.209 --> 22:06.310
Georgie: Oh, Jack, I'm-I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

22:06.345 --> 22:07.712
I can wear something else.

22:07.747 --> 22:10.115
Jack: Well, now, why
would you do that?

22:10.149 --> 22:12.216
You look beautiful.
(Footsteps on the stairs)

22:12.251 --> 22:14.918
You're gonna be
the belle of the ball.

22:14.953 --> 22:17.622
Lisa: Here you two are.
Dinner's almost ready.

22:17.656 --> 22:20.057
- Lisa: Wow.
- Georgie: Do you like it?

22:20.091 --> 22:21.925
Lisa: What a lovely dress.
Where did you find that?

22:21.960 --> 22:23.528
Georgie: Uh, just in one
of the storage trunks.

22:23.562 --> 22:24.728
Lisa: Well, it couldn't
be more perfect.

22:24.763 --> 22:26.597
Look at that.

22:26.632 --> 22:29.399
Maybe just shorten
these a little bit, hey?

22:29.433 --> 22:32.502
Uh... how are you feeling?

22:32.537 --> 22:36.974
- Georgie: Uh, fine. Why?
- Because I see a rash on your neck...

22:37.008 --> 22:39.342
and you...

22:39.377 --> 22:41.178
I think you have
a bit of a temperature.

22:41.212 --> 22:42.279
Georgie: What?

22:42.313 --> 22:44.781
(Truck rumbles)

22:47.985 --> 22:49.352
Matt: Hey, Jade.

22:49.387 --> 22:51.821
(Door opens) Hop in.

22:51.855 --> 22:54.624
- Jade: Hey.
- Matt: Hey. You ready?

22:54.659 --> 22:57.060
Jade: Yeah. Where's Riley?

22:57.094 --> 22:59.529
Matt: Um, he's not coming.

22:59.564 --> 23:03.166
I figured why not keep it
to just the two of us tonight.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.467
Jade: Cool. Where's the party?

23:05.502 --> 23:08.304
I uh... couldn't find
a good one,

23:08.338 --> 23:10.940
so what do you say
you and I head on over

23:10.974 --> 23:13.642
to the old, uh, rock quarry?

23:13.677 --> 23:16.045
Jade: The rock quarry?

23:16.080 --> 23:19.281
Isn't that where people go to,
you know, make out and stuff?

23:19.316 --> 23:21.116
Matt: (Snorts) I
don't know, is it?

23:21.150 --> 23:25.354
I mean, that wouldn't be such
a bad thing if it was, right?

23:25.388 --> 23:27.590
Maybe we can go
to a movie instead.

23:27.624 --> 23:29.625
You, uh, don't wanna hang out
with me?

23:29.659 --> 23:32.701
No, I-I do.
Just not at the quarry.

23:35.066 --> 23:36.965
I thought when you, uh,
showed up at rodeo school,

23:36.999 --> 23:39.186
it meant you liked me.

23:39.206 --> 23:41.136
Well, maybe I just wanted
to learn how to ride a bronc.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.871
Matt: (Snickers)

23:42.905 --> 23:44.706
Why is that funny?

23:44.741 --> 23:47.142
Matt: Hey, come on, Jade.
I mean...

23:47.176 --> 23:49.532
We both know you're never
getting on a bronc.

23:50.090 --> 23:53.848
I've been to dozens of rodeos.
I've never seen a girl compete.

23:53.882 --> 23:56.699
Jade: Right, 'cause all we're
good for is going to the quarry.

23:59.802 --> 24:03.358
Matt: All right, look, is this...
Is this happening or not?

24:03.392 --> 24:04.825
Not. (Opens door)

24:08.329 --> 24:10.697
(Door bangs shut) Matt: Hey! You
know what your problem is, Jade?

24:10.732 --> 24:13.167
You're a tease.

24:13.201 --> 24:16.470
No wonder everyone at school
thinks you're a big joke.

24:16.504 --> 24:19.907
(Engine starts,
truck rumbles away)

24:26.714 --> 24:29.391
(Vehicle rumbles to a halt)

24:29.411 --> 24:31.873
Amy: Ty, just pull over. You
don't want him to see us.

24:34.321 --> 24:36.756
(Engines cut out)

24:39.726 --> 24:43.529
(Door bangs shut)
Man: Go inside, if you want.

24:43.563 --> 24:45.121
Ty: Stay here. I'll
be right back.

24:45.141 --> 24:47.232
I'm coming with you.

24:47.267 --> 24:48.901
No, Amy, it's too dangerous.

24:48.935 --> 24:52.558
So you're gonna leave me alone
in the truck? Here?

24:56.410 --> 24:57.876
Let's go. (Doors open)

24:59.879 --> 25:02.214
(Door s bang shut)

25:02.248 --> 25:04.283
(Footsteps crunch)

25:09.999 --> 25:12.838
- Tim: Jade?
- Jade: Hey, Tim.

25:14.563 --> 25:15.907
Are you crying?

25:15.942 --> 25:18.010
No... (Sniffs)

25:23.616 --> 25:25.283
You okay?

25:25.317 --> 25:27.318
Oh, fine. Never better.

25:27.353 --> 25:29.820
(Sniffs) Best night of my life.

25:29.855 --> 25:31.523
(Crying)

25:34.288 --> 25:35.726
Why don't we go in
and have a coffee

25:35.761 --> 25:37.562
and we'll talk about this.

25:37.596 --> 25:38.964
Okay.

25:39.798 --> 25:41.273
Come on.

25:45.370 --> 25:46.904
(Lights hum)

25:49.007 --> 25:50.541
(Mop slides)

25:52.644 --> 25:54.979
Wade: Hey, guys.

25:55.013 --> 25:58.115
(Water splashes)

25:58.150 --> 26:01.218
Yeah, I saw you. (Water drains)

26:01.252 --> 26:03.668
You were right behind me
when I left the motel.

26:06.025 --> 26:08.758
Ty: I needed to know where
you were going at night.

26:08.793 --> 26:10.360
Wade: Well, you caught me.

26:10.395 --> 26:12.996
I break into buildings
and mop the floors.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.343
(Wet mop slaps the floor)
Call the cops.

26:17.301 --> 26:19.669
Why didn't you
just tell me that?

26:19.704 --> 26:21.971
I don't spend a lot of time
bragging about my foray

26:22.006 --> 26:25.200
into the exciting world
of janitorial services.

26:25.220 --> 26:28.444
Ty: You already have a job.
What's this really about?

26:30.848 --> 26:33.480
Wade: Lily's rehab is expensive.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.185
I work here to make
a little extra cash.

26:38.488 --> 26:41.484
Wade, I'm... I'm sorry
that we followed you here.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.564
Security guard's gonna be making
his rounds in a few minutes.

26:48.598 --> 26:51.492
You might wanna...
leave before then.

26:54.272 --> 26:57.272
Come on, Ty, let's go.

26:57.307 --> 26:59.675
(Receding footsteps)

27:02.346 --> 27:04.513
(Wade sucks his teeth)

27:04.548 --> 27:06.681
(Wet mop slaps the floor)

27:12.392 --> 27:17.492
Tim: Some boys, at the age
of 17, can be real idiots.

27:17.526 --> 27:21.964
Trust me, I'm speaking
from personal experience.

27:21.998 --> 27:25.645
Matt Smith has a lot
to learn about women.

27:27.603 --> 27:29.604
Jade: Well, he thinks the only
reason I signed up for bronc school

27:29.638 --> 27:32.106
was... (Sniffs)
to get his attention.

27:32.140 --> 27:34.542
Was it?

27:34.577 --> 27:38.079
Well, maybe at first, but...

27:38.113 --> 27:40.114
Then I really got into it.
And-and Caleb even said

27:40.148 --> 27:41.915
I was pretty good
on the bucking machine.

27:41.935 --> 27:45.152
You definitely held your own.

27:45.187 --> 27:47.889
I know I'm no Kaila Mussell
or anything,

27:47.923 --> 27:51.492
but... I thought I deserved
to be there as much as the boys.

27:51.526 --> 27:53.194
You know who Kaila Mussell is?

27:53.228 --> 27:54.962
Jade: Yeah, she's a
professional bronc rider.

27:54.997 --> 27:57.733
She's been kicking butt
on the circuit for years.

28:00.001 --> 28:01.402
I did my research
before I signed up.

28:01.436 --> 28:03.737
- I'm not stupid.
- Tim: Obviously.

28:03.772 --> 28:05.338
Jade: (Sighs) You know...
It doesn't matter

28:05.373 --> 28:08.174
because I'm just gonna quit
anyway.

28:08.209 --> 28:10.377
So you're gonna let Matt win?

28:10.412 --> 28:13.846
Well, I can't face him now.

28:13.881 --> 28:16.849
That doesn't sound
like the Jade I know.

28:16.884 --> 28:19.585
The Jade I know would stand up
for herself,

28:19.620 --> 28:21.788
demand their respect.

28:21.822 --> 28:25.358
She'd finish what she started.

28:25.393 --> 28:28.861
The Jade I know would show
those guys what she's made of.

28:28.896 --> 28:31.163
(Diners chatter)

28:31.197 --> 28:33.132
(Birds chirp)

28:35.569 --> 28:37.503
(Pacing footsteps)

28:37.538 --> 28:38.905
Jack: don't worry, Lou,

28:38.939 --> 28:42.973
Dr. Virani said
she's gonna be just fine.

28:43.877 --> 28:47.012
Yeah, well,
when it comes to chicken pox

28:47.047 --> 28:49.748
there's nothing much you can do
but ride it out.

28:49.782 --> 28:51.541
Lisa: don't scratch. It'll
leave a scar, honey.

28:51.561 --> 28:54.370
Jack:
Yeah, okay, I'll let her know.

28:54.390 --> 28:56.922
Okay, talk to you soon. Bye.

28:56.957 --> 29:01.890
Well, Lou says you can call her
or Peter at any time,

29:01.910 --> 29:02.928
and they love you.

29:02.962 --> 29:05.730
Right now, I guess you better
get a hold of Stephen

29:05.765 --> 29:08.032
and let him know you won't be
coming to the dance.

29:08.067 --> 29:09.935
(Sighs heavily)
Worst day of my life.

29:09.969 --> 29:11.470
(Dialing beeps)

29:14.340 --> 29:16.775
(Vehicle rumbles)

29:21.746 --> 29:23.747
(Door clicks open,
engine cuts out)

29:25.750 --> 29:28.386
Ty: Following you was a...

29:28.420 --> 29:30.588
It was a lousy thing to do,
Wade.

29:30.622 --> 29:33.183
Wade: Yup. Yeah, it was.

29:35.256 --> 29:38.929
Ty: Why didn't you tell me my
mom was going back into rehab?

29:39.053 --> 29:41.866
(Door bangs shut) Lily was a
little embarrassed about that.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.703
She wanted me to keep it quiet.
And it wasn't just that.

29:45.737 --> 29:50.556
I guess I figured that uh...
You'd just blame me...

29:51.275 --> 29:54.044
no matter what I said
you wouldn't listen to me,

29:54.078 --> 29:58.181
all right? And it turns out
I was right about that.

29:58.216 --> 30:02.901
Well, I'm listening now.
I wanna know what happened.

30:05.438 --> 30:08.044
It wasn't just one thing.

30:09.292 --> 30:13.730
I guess it all started when Lily
got laid off from work and...

30:13.764 --> 30:16.633
She couldn't find another job.

30:16.667 --> 30:20.737
She got pretty depressed
about that.

30:20.771 --> 30:22.972
She hid the drinking from me
for a long time,

30:23.007 --> 30:27.139
but... I started hearing it
in her voice.

30:27.577 --> 30:31.046
Like uh... she wasn't slurring
her words or anything,

30:31.080 --> 30:33.870
just... she just sounded
a little too bright...

30:33.890 --> 30:35.267
Louder, you know?

30:35.287 --> 30:38.811
Yeah... I heard it too.

30:39.688 --> 30:43.254
I was... talking to her
on the phone and I heard it.

30:47.439 --> 30:49.281
I should've done something.
I-I-I...

30:49.301 --> 30:51.365
What could you have done, Ty?

30:51.399 --> 30:54.068
Your mom's a grown woman.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.203
She's the only one who can
get herself out of this.

30:56.237 --> 30:58.747
I-I-I got her in the best rehab
I could find.

30:58.767 --> 31:01.460
The rest... is up to her.

31:04.203 --> 31:06.046
Well, I wanna help you pay
for her rehab.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.100
- Wade: No, no, no way.
- Ty: Yeah, you're working two jobs.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.981
- I can help.
- Wade: No.

31:10.167 --> 31:11.607
She's my mother.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.630
She's my wife.

31:16.691 --> 31:19.204
I gotta go get ready
for a shift.

31:20.345 --> 31:22.395
Hey, I'm gonna...

31:22.429 --> 31:23.870
I'm gonna go see her
in a couple days.

31:23.890 --> 31:26.302
I'll let you know
how she's doing.

31:28.052 --> 31:30.236
(Keys jingle)

31:31.105 --> 31:32.624
See you, Ty.

31:32.644 --> 31:34.774
(Unlocks door, door bangs shut)

31:34.809 --> 31:37.543
- Lisa: We need to talk.
- Amy: Okay. What's up?

31:37.578 --> 31:40.746
Lisa: Well, about your wedding.

31:40.780 --> 31:44.650
I'm getting a little worried that things
aren't being handled in a timely fashion.

31:44.684 --> 31:46.752
For example, the venue.
You haven't booked it yet

31:46.786 --> 31:48.421
and it's really
one of those things you...

31:48.455 --> 31:50.289
first check off your list,
you know?

31:50.324 --> 31:51.857
Amy: Yeah, well, Lou and
I are working on it.

31:51.891 --> 31:53.892
But Lou's not even here and...

31:53.927 --> 31:55.560
I feel like you're not really
on top of things.

31:55.595 --> 31:57.395
Yes, I am.

31:57.430 --> 32:00.032
Oh! Oh, good.
Well, then, did you...

32:00.066 --> 32:02.400
did you pick some flowers
or-or-or tour some venues?

32:02.435 --> 32:04.970
Amy: No, not yet, but...

32:05.005 --> 32:07.039
Lisa: But see, you're kinda
running out of time, honey,

32:07.073 --> 32:09.341
and I'm-I tell you this
because, you know,

32:09.375 --> 32:12.877
once you get behind, it's almost
impossible to get back on top.

32:12.911 --> 32:16.214
Let me help you.
I can take care of the flowers.

32:16.249 --> 32:17.915
- Amy: No, Lisa, I really don't...
- Just give me a couple-just a colour.

32:17.950 --> 32:19.682
- Amy: Lisa! Can you just...
- Lisa: Like purple or yellow.

32:19.702 --> 32:22.254
Please stop, okay?

32:22.288 --> 32:24.406
I'm sorry, but stop butting in.

32:24.426 --> 32:26.824
You're making way too big
a deal of this.

32:26.859 --> 32:30.956
Well... it is a big deal.
It's-it's your wedding.

32:31.192 --> 32:33.326
Yeah, my wedding.

32:35.834 --> 32:39.626
Tim: Okay, gang, this
is Tequila hangover.

32:39.837 --> 32:41.654
Caleb's gonna be riding him.

32:41.674 --> 32:44.409
He's a tame bucking horse.

32:45.242 --> 32:46.777
I want you to watch closely.

32:46.811 --> 32:48.378
When Caleb comes out
of the chute

32:48.412 --> 32:50.580
and rides out there,
watch how he spurs,

32:50.614 --> 32:52.816
and-and how he's in time
with the horse, okay?

32:52.850 --> 32:54.985
(Horse whinnies)

32:55.019 --> 32:56.820
Casey will record all this and
then we'll play it back afterward.

32:56.854 --> 32:58.989
Caleb, you ready?

32:59.023 --> 33:01.023
(Gate clanks open, horse grunts)

33:01.058 --> 33:03.159
(High-pitched whinny,
hooves thunder)

33:06.230 --> 33:08.364
(Horse grunts and whinnies,
bucks wildly)

33:08.399 --> 33:09.732
Riley: Whoa, look at him go!

33:09.766 --> 33:11.401
Matt: Aw, man, check it out!

33:11.435 --> 33:12.935
(Horse kicks and bucks wildly)

33:18.308 --> 33:21.244
Tim: Okay. Not bad. Not great.

33:22.245 --> 33:23.579
Caleb: I think I'll take
that as a compliment.

33:23.613 --> 33:25.014
- Casey: Wanna see it back?
- Caleb: Yeah.

33:25.048 --> 33:27.010
Casey: Here it is.

33:35.958 --> 33:37.759
Tim: All right.

33:37.793 --> 33:40.128
Okay, you see how he stays back...
And lifts his rein?

33:40.162 --> 33:41.763
That gives him
a good spurring motion

33:41.797 --> 33:44.666
so it can stay in time
with the horse's bucking.

33:44.701 --> 33:46.901
- Okay, back-back it up again.
- Casey: Yup.

33:46.936 --> 33:48.637
Tim: Now-(Gate clangs open)

33:48.671 --> 33:51.372
(Horse whinnies)

33:51.406 --> 33:54.442
- Tim: What the hell?! Jade!
- Jade: Agh! Ungh!

33:54.476 --> 33:55.844
(Jade grunts, horse whinnies)

33:55.878 --> 33:57.879
(Thunderous bucking and kicking)

33:57.913 --> 33:59.547
Ungh!

33:59.581 --> 34:01.950
Tim: Jade!

34:01.984 --> 34:04.719
Jade? Jade.

34:04.754 --> 34:07.154
(Horse whinnies nearby)

34:12.494 --> 34:13.960
Beat that, boys.

34:20.568 --> 34:22.143
Jade.

34:24.183 --> 34:26.217
What do you think
you were doing, huh?

34:26.251 --> 34:28.485
Do realize how dangerous
that was?

34:28.520 --> 34:30.321
The whole reason that
I started this rodeo school

34:30.355 --> 34:32.489
was to teach kids to ride safe,

34:32.524 --> 34:35.192
and you did the exact
opposite of that.

34:35.226 --> 34:36.797
You told me to show those guys
what I'm made of.

34:36.818 --> 34:38.062
Not like that!

34:38.096 --> 34:40.630
I had to, Tim!
I'm not just some buckle bunny

34:40.665 --> 34:42.565
Matt Smith can take
to the quarry.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.784
No, you're not.

34:48.284 --> 34:50.254
You didn't have to ride
that bronc to prove that.

34:50.274 --> 34:51.808
Yes, I did.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.810
Now every time Matt Corners
some girl in his truck,

34:53.844 --> 34:55.677
he's gonna think of me
flying out of that chute

34:55.697 --> 34:57.559
and kicking his butt.

34:59.450 --> 35:01.985
You got some serious guts,
I'll give you that.

35:02.019 --> 35:03.153
Now, I've got two granddaughters

35:03.187 --> 35:04.454
and when I think
about all the Matts

35:04.489 --> 35:07.161
that they're gonna run into
in their lives,

35:07.446 --> 35:09.892
makes me crazy.

35:09.927 --> 35:11.193
I just hope that
they deal with them

35:11.228 --> 35:13.556
with as much strength
as you did today.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.635
But you broke the rules.

35:19.078 --> 35:20.770
I'm out, aren't I?

35:20.804 --> 35:22.906
Pack up your stuff.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.177
Amy: And Lisa just kept
pushing me about the wedding,

35:28.197 --> 35:31.404
so... I kinda told her
to butt out.

35:32.015 --> 35:33.516
Well, that doesn't
sound like you.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.186
I know, but she wouldn't take no
for an answer.

35:36.206 --> 35:38.754
So why did you say no?

35:38.788 --> 35:41.990
Because... I already have Lou
breathing down my neck.

35:42.025 --> 35:44.893
The last thing we need is another
wedding planner in the mix.

35:44.927 --> 35:46.659
Ty: Okay...

35:47.094 --> 35:51.599
Amy, Lou's not here and
we're both pretty busy, so...

35:51.634 --> 35:53.735
doesn't Lisa helping out
sound like a good idea to you?

35:53.770 --> 35:55.203
Amy: (Sighs heavily)

35:55.237 --> 35:56.688
Ty: Unless you don't want help.

35:56.708 --> 35:59.106
Amy: No, I... I do.

35:59.637 --> 36:01.685
Okay. What's the problem then?

36:03.445 --> 36:06.548
Matt: Hey, Jade. Wait up. Jade!

36:06.582 --> 36:09.149
Hey, just... hear me out, okay?

36:11.554 --> 36:13.954
Look, what you did
on that bronc back there...

36:13.989 --> 36:15.956
It was pretty cool.

36:15.991 --> 36:17.792
I didn't think
you had it in you.

36:18.351 --> 36:20.126
Now you know.

36:20.522 --> 36:22.756
Sucks you got kicked out.

36:23.910 --> 36:26.566
All right, look. I'm uh...

36:26.600 --> 36:29.632
I'm sorry about last night.
I was...

36:29.652 --> 36:31.220
I was being a jerk.

36:31.240 --> 36:32.916
Yeah, you were.

36:35.552 --> 36:38.344
All right, well, sorry.

36:40.314 --> 36:43.949
(Birds chirp,
steers bellow in the distance)

36:43.983 --> 36:45.751
(Tools buzz and whir,
men chatter)

36:45.785 --> 36:47.325
Wade: Yeah, you can go ahead
and work on that. Man: Mm-hmm.

36:47.345 --> 36:49.722
Hey, Wade?

36:50.398 --> 36:52.297
What's this?

36:52.317 --> 36:55.131
Ty: Amy and I talked about it. We wanna
help you pay for my mom's rehab.

36:55.151 --> 36:58.597
Wade: Oh, man, Ty, I told you.
I don't want it.

36:58.631 --> 37:00.532
Ty: I know, Wade, but you
can't work two jobs forever.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.784
You're gonna burn out.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.132
Let us help.

37:04.281 --> 37:06.972
(Men chatter)

37:09.385 --> 37:12.884
Aren't you afraid I'm gonna...
just take the money and run?

37:14.324 --> 37:17.438
No. I trust you.

37:20.251 --> 37:22.175
I appreciate it.

37:25.157 --> 37:26.766
You should come down
and visit your mom

37:26.786 --> 37:28.893
when she's feeling up to it.

37:29.712 --> 37:32.230
Yeah, I will.

37:32.264 --> 37:35.566
I'm gonna make sure
she gets better, Ty.

37:36.004 --> 37:39.003
With any luck, she'll be better,

37:39.037 --> 37:42.859
we'll make it up to the wedding and we'll
be sitting right there in the front row.

37:45.217 --> 37:46.520
Thanks.

37:46.818 --> 37:48.245
(Shake hands)

37:51.949 --> 37:53.805
(Receding footsteps)

38:02.363 --> 38:04.460
You have a visitor.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.413
- Georgie: Oh!
- Stephen: Hey, Georgie.

38:06.433 --> 38:08.381
Georgie: Stephen... hi!

38:12.069 --> 38:16.214
Jack: So... I'll just be in
the kitchen, if you need me.

38:18.361 --> 38:20.786
Georgie: Uh, don't get too close.
I'm contagious.

38:20.806 --> 38:22.702
I already had chicken pox,
so I'm not worried.

38:22.722 --> 38:25.734
Oh. Okay.

38:25.768 --> 38:29.271
So um... are you looking forward
to the dance?

38:29.306 --> 38:30.756
I don't think I'll be going.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.108
How come?

38:32.142 --> 38:34.310
If you're not going,
neither am I.

38:34.344 --> 38:35.944
So if you're not busy,
maybe we can hang out.

38:35.979 --> 38:38.746
Uh, yeah, yeah. Sure, okay.

38:39.983 --> 38:41.217
So what do you feel like doing?

38:41.251 --> 38:43.151
Uh... anything. Just talk to me.

38:43.185 --> 38:46.375
Anything to distract me
from how itchy I am.

38:46.395 --> 38:49.147
When I had chicken pox, my mom
made me wear a pair of oven mitts.

38:49.167 --> 38:50.191
Did it work?

38:50.226 --> 38:51.660
Oh no. I still scratched.

38:51.694 --> 38:53.762
(Laughing)

39:02.271 --> 39:04.339
Lisa: Hey.

39:04.373 --> 39:06.508
- Amy: Hey.
- Lisa: Can I come in?

39:06.542 --> 39:09.444
Amy: Yeah.

39:09.478 --> 39:12.480
(Photograph thumps lightly)

39:12.515 --> 39:14.715
I'm really sorry about before.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.919
Don't, Amy, worry about it
for a second.

39:18.954 --> 39:21.522
That's a really beautiful dress.

39:21.556 --> 39:24.659
Amy: It was my mom's. (Sighs)

39:24.693 --> 39:26.360
Mrs. Bell made it.

39:26.394 --> 39:27.762
- Lisa: Really?
- Amy: Yeah. (Chuckles)

39:27.796 --> 39:30.264
(Sighs) I found it in the
attic the other day.

39:33.201 --> 39:35.402
When I was a little girl,

39:35.436 --> 39:37.971
I always used to imagine
what my wedding would be like.

39:38.005 --> 39:40.140
I even told my mom that...

39:40.175 --> 39:42.342
I was gonna ride sugarfoot
down the aisle.

39:42.377 --> 39:45.443
Lisa: (Laughing)
Amy: He was my favorite pony back then.

39:47.478 --> 39:50.316
I guess I just thought that...

39:50.350 --> 39:52.919
when it came time
for my real wedding,

39:52.953 --> 39:55.088
my mom would be here...

39:55.122 --> 39:58.194
to help me make
all the big decisions.

39:58.442 --> 40:01.197
(Sighs heavily,
clasps Amy's hand)

40:02.134 --> 40:04.969
Nobody can replace your mom,
of course,

40:05.004 --> 40:08.239
and I wouldn't even dream
of trying.

40:08.273 --> 40:10.175
I just wanna make it easier
for you, Amy.

40:10.209 --> 40:12.343
If there's anything I can do,
I wanna do that.

40:12.377 --> 40:16.315
And if it means butting out,
I promise I can do that too.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.510
Yellow.

40:23.615 --> 40:25.563
Yellow... what?

40:26.047 --> 40:29.827
You asked me what colour I liked
for the wedding bouquet.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.766
- I pick yellow.
- Lisa: Okay.

40:32.171 --> 40:34.806
So then I'll...
Go to the flower shop

40:34.841 --> 40:37.109
and look for yellow bouquets
for you.

40:37.143 --> 40:38.772
(Chuckles) Okay...

40:39.294 --> 40:40.912
Aw...

40:40.947 --> 40:42.447
- Amy: Okay.
- Lisa: Okay.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.282
Amy: (Sniffs)

40:44.316 --> 40:46.818
Maybe some blue ones too.

40:46.853 --> 40:50.070
Yeah? Yellow and blue.
I'm on it.

40:58.497 --> 41:00.131
(Sighs)

41:02.601 --> 41:05.035
Tim: That's good, Matt.

41:05.070 --> 41:07.037
You're sitting back,
pulling on the rein.

41:07.072 --> 41:09.474
(Bucking machine thumps,
Matt grunts)

41:09.508 --> 41:10.941
Looks like you might actually
be capable

41:10.976 --> 41:12.843
of learning something
after all, huh?

41:12.863 --> 41:15.479
Who knew?

41:15.513 --> 41:17.949
Casey: How's it going?

41:18.449 --> 41:20.117
Tim: So far so good.

41:20.152 --> 41:22.281
(Matt grunts,
bucking machine thumps)

41:22.301 --> 41:25.169
Tim: I feel bad about kicking
Jade out of the class.

41:25.189 --> 41:26.791
Casey: I know, but what
she did was crazy.

41:26.825 --> 41:28.525
You did the right thing.

41:28.559 --> 41:30.226
Tim: That girl though,
she is fearless,

41:30.261 --> 41:33.226
and that is not a bad quality
to have as a bronc rider.

41:33.547 --> 41:35.766
I think I'm gonna her a place
in the next class,

41:35.800 --> 41:37.919
if she's really serious
about it.

41:37.939 --> 41:40.265
Casey:
I think that's a good idea.

41:40.338 --> 41:42.339
It might be a bit crowded
though.

41:42.374 --> 41:43.807
I just had three parents call me

41:43.841 --> 41:46.743
wanting to get their kids
signed up.

41:46.777 --> 41:50.614
That means word's getting out.
Congratulations.

41:50.648 --> 41:53.182
Tim: Thanks. Well, I
owe it all to you.

41:53.217 --> 41:55.819
Casey:
(Laughs) I didn't do anything.

41:55.853 --> 41:57.563
Tim: You did. Come on, you're
the one that convinced me

41:57.583 --> 41:58.889
that I could do this.

41:58.923 --> 42:02.158
I wouldn't have even tried
if it wasn't for you.

42:02.192 --> 42:04.760
Thanks. (Kiss)

42:04.794 --> 42:08.930
♪ I wanna love you so long
that your tastes change ♪

42:08.964 --> 42:10.365
(Door bangs shut) Ty: Hey.

42:10.400 --> 42:12.467
Amy: What do you think?

42:12.502 --> 42:15.337
Ty: Oh, yeah, those are nice.

42:15.371 --> 42:17.406
Amy: They're a sample
from the flower store.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.275
