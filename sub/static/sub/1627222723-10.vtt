Hey, ho!

00:08.562 --> 00:10.825
They're taking down
the signs right now.

00:10.925 --> 00:12.466
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:12.566 --> 00:14.109
[Gerald] Once you knew
opioids were addictive,

00:14.209 --> 00:15.631
you continued to promote them
as if they were not.

00:15.731 --> 00:17.032
[Dani]
We've been through this.

00:17.132 --> 00:18.194
I know the line
about user error.

00:18.294 --> 00:19.315
Blame the addict, I get it.

00:19.415 --> 00:21.718
Daniela, this is a disaster!

00:21.818 --> 00:23.400
The trial will be over
before it begins.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.803
-I'm handling it.
-Make it go away.

00:25.903 --> 00:28.566
I think I'm gonna have to come
out as a bisexual again.

00:28.666 --> 00:31.290
Well, at least you got a 12-week
book tour to get it right.

00:31.390 --> 00:33.252
-Where is Shane?
-Are they back from Vegas?

00:33.353 --> 00:35.334
[Tina] What's the deal with
those two, are they together?

00:35.434 --> 00:37.497
[Alice]
Okay. The answer is yes.

00:37.597 --> 00:39.740
I'm really sorry, but I don't
think you're gonna be able

00:39.840 --> 00:42.062
-to meet Marcus today.
-I'm still gonna meet him

00:42.162 --> 00:43.384
eventually, right?

00:43.484 --> 00:44.585
[Bette]
I can't even tell you

00:44.685 --> 00:46.068
how many versions
of that she made.

00:46.168 --> 00:48.711
I look forward to seeing her.

I don't know where Finley is.

00:54.258 --> 00:55.719
We got into a fight,
and she left.

00:55.819 --> 00:57.882
-Was she drinking?
-Yes. After she got a DUI.

00:57.982 --> 00:59.324
What? My God!

00:59.424 --> 01:00.605
Why are you with this person?

01:00.705 --> 01:01.927
Because I love her.

01:02.027 --> 01:03.729
[Finley]
Hello? Come on, let me in.

01:03.829 --> 01:05.612
[Dani] What's going on?
Are you okay?

01:05.712 --> 01:08.055
[Finley]
Me? No, I'm totally great, bruh.

01:08.155 --> 01:09.536
[Tina] I want to know
why you can't be happy

01:09.636 --> 01:11.698
-for me and Carrie.
-I am happy for you.

01:11.798 --> 01:13.821
Are you still in love with me?

01:20.129 --> 01:21.711
[Tess]
Yeah, I'm just nervous.

01:21.811 --> 01:22.992

what it's gonna be.

-[Tess] Yes.
-[Shane] All right?

01:24.654 --> 01:25.615
[Shane] Relax.
Should you even be doing this?

01:25.695 --> 01:26.997
[Tess]
No, it's okay.

01:27.097 --> 01:29.840
Hey, we're doing
the right thing.

[Sophie]
[quietly] Okay.

-[Sophie exhales]
-Got a...

It's okay. She's not here yet.

01:45.559 --> 01:47.102
-Uh, thank you.
-Yeah.

01:47.202 --> 01:48.423
I didn't know what to bring
to an intervention.

01:48.523 --> 01:49.945
Ah, you brought ham.

01:50.045 --> 01:51.988
Well, I mean, it's better
than champagne, right?

01:52.088 --> 01:53.550
[chuckling]

01:53.650 --> 01:55.071
[Alice] Forget it. Anyway.
No, I panicked, I got...

01:55.171 --> 01:56.713
-[Shane] Oh, come on.
-[Alice] Hey...

01:56.813 --> 01:58.155
[Shane] Listen, there's
nothing to panic about.

01:58.255 --> 01:59.677
[Tess] Yeah,
it's gonna be great, right?

01:59.777 --> 02:01.319
We're just gonna tell her
that we love her

02:01.419 --> 02:04.082
and she's gonna go get help.

02:04.182 --> 02:06.525
[Micah] It might not be
that simple, though.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.048
[Tess] I think it's important
we stay positive.

02:09.148 --> 02:11.451
Yeah, but...

02:11.551 --> 02:13.853
it feels fast.

02:13.954 --> 02:16.337
Doesn't it?

02:16.437 --> 02:18.059
[Shane] Sophie,
I don't ever think there's

02:18.159 --> 02:20.061
a really good time
to do any of this shit.

02:20.161 --> 02:22.344
Yeah, but I-I don't...

02:22.444 --> 02:24.467
I don't want to scare her.

02:24.567 --> 02:27.390
And I don't want to force her
to go if she's not ready.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.312
Hey.

02:29.412 --> 02:31.435
She's gonna go, okay?

02:31.535 --> 02:33.718
She's gonna go.

[door opens]

Hi.

02:37.583 --> 02:40.046
I got fucking bit today.

02:40.146 --> 02:44.371
Not by, uh, a kid.
By a parent, actually.

02:44.471 --> 02:46.454
But it's kind of a long...

02:46.554 --> 02:48.656
-Whoa! Hi.
-[Tess] Hi.

02:48.756 --> 02:49.937

[Tess]
Um... come on.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.063
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come, come...

02:55.164 --> 02:58.148
come sit with us in the...
living room for a second.

02:58.248 --> 02:59.910
Hi.

03:00.010 --> 03:03.314
Is there, like, a German word
for a surprise party

03:03.414 --> 03:05.697
with, like, really bad vibes?

03:07.139 --> 03:09.602
'Cause, um...

03:09.702 --> 03:11.844
What's up?

03:11.944 --> 03:14.748
We love you.

03:15.749 --> 03:17.050
[Finley]
Yeah, same, dude.

03:17.150 --> 03:19.093
[Alice]
But, like, a lot, you know?

03:19.193 --> 03:21.056
You're like
a real ray of sunshine,

03:21.156 --> 03:23.258
and, um, you're
like a puppy, you know?

03:23.358 --> 03:25.621
Even if it bites you,
you love it.

03:25.721 --> 03:27.343
Okay... [chuckles]

03:27.443 --> 03:29.646
We're worried about you.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.110
Uh-huh.

03:33.210 --> 03:35.212
[Tess] And we found a place
that we think can help.

03:36.815 --> 03:38.717
Uh...

03:38.817 --> 03:40.759
what kind of place?

03:40.860 --> 03:43.363
[Alice]
It's amazing. It's, um...

03:43.463 --> 03:45.204
[clears throat]
It's got a pool.

03:45.304 --> 03:47.968
It has, um,
an ocean view, which is nice.

03:48.068 --> 03:51.772
Um, a Top Chef finalist does
all the food, so...

03:51.872 --> 03:54.035
It's a rehab, Fin.

03:55.237 --> 03:57.139
Oh, shit.

Yeah, and-and look,

04:01.485 --> 04:02.986

waiting for you

-when you get back.

04:04.528 --> 04:06.751
that's really, um...

04:06.851 --> 04:10.115
But I don't think
I need to drink spa water

04:10.215 --> 04:12.697
by a pool to, like,
get my shit together.

04:13.779 --> 04:15.682
Okay, then, what do you need?

04:15.782 --> 04:17.444
Nothing.

04:17.544 --> 04:19.887
I had a bad night, okay?

04:19.987 --> 04:22.410
[Micah]
It wasn't one night.

04:22.510 --> 04:25.093
I'm in my 20s. I fuck up
like somebody in their 20s.

I mean, what the fuck
were your 20s like, dude?

04:27.036 --> 04:28.938
Nah, nah, nah--
Don't-- n-no. Don't do that.

Mine were amazing.

what, yesterday?

with her soon-to-be wife.

How do you feel about that?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.400
Fine.

I'd feel a lot better
if you came with me.

07:38.267 --> 07:41.891
Nah, I don't want to go...

convince yourself

uncomfortable going,

07:54.206 --> 07:55.828
then-then that's fine,

07:55.928 --> 07:58.631
but there's no reason
to be accusatory.

trust my instincts.

08:23.201 --> 08:25.204

08:26.445 --> 08:29.049
Something about you and Tina...

08:30.290 --> 08:32.733
...makes me feel
some kind of way.

08:34.695 --> 08:37.158
She's the mother of my child.

08:37.258 --> 08:39.341
And she'll always be in my life.

08:41.904 --> 08:44.707
Mm. Of course she will.

And I think it's more than that.

You're wrong.

09:07.976 --> 09:09.677
-[laughter]
-[Angie] Okay.

09:09.777 --> 09:11.880
So I did go a little overboard

09:11.980 --> 09:14.563
with the dresses, but...

09:14.663 --> 09:16.766
if they're shit, it's fine.
I can I just send them back.

09:16.866 --> 09:18.849
But, um... this is cute.

09:18.949 --> 09:22.493
Uh... also, I,
uh, I haven't asked,

09:22.593 --> 09:25.337
um, if we could share
a hotel room yet,

09:25.437 --> 09:27.499
but I'm gonna do it.
I just need to figure out how.

09:27.599 --> 09:30.423
Um, if we went the money angle--
I don't know,

09:30.523 --> 09:33.967
I'll-I'll figure it out.
It's gonna be fine. Um...

09:37.251 --> 09:38.953
Yeah?

09:39.053 --> 09:40.876
Are you okay?

09:40.976 --> 09:42.558
Yeah. Yeah, why?

-Why?

19:00.374 --> 19:02.035
[Shane] Okay, you know what,
I wasn't gonna say anything,

19:02.135 --> 19:04.158
but, Bette,
if you are having any doubts

19:04.258 --> 19:06.040
about Tina getting married...

19:06.140 --> 19:09.405
I am not having any doubts
about Tina getting married.

19:09.505 --> 19:11.608
Carrie is having cold feet.

19:11.708 --> 19:13.369
Wait, what?

19:13.469 --> 19:15.772
-How do you know that?
-[Shane] All I'm saying is,

19:15.872 --> 19:18.656
if there was ever a time
to win her back...

19:18.756 --> 19:21.239
I think it's now or never.

19:24.482 --> 19:26.225
[Alice]
Okay...

19:26.325 --> 19:28.908
I, uh, I'm gonna need to know
if this wedding is on or not,

19:29.008 --> 19:30.310
because I got to land on a gift.

19:30.410 --> 19:31.871

19:31.971 --> 19:35.116

-[Shane] Oh, relax.

[Harriet] Please state
your name for the record.

19:37.178 --> 19:38.880
[Gabrielle] Gabrielle Sheridan.
I'm a medical researcher.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.042
And you ran a medical trial
to test the addictive properties

19:41.142 --> 19:42.725
of opioids for Nùñez Inc.?

19:42.825 --> 19:44.207
[Gabrielle]
I did.

19:44.307 --> 19:45.728
[Harriet] And what conclusion
did you come to?

19:45.828 --> 19:47.170
[Gabrielle]
That these particular opioids

19:47.270 --> 19:48.612
were more addictive
than any other drug.

19:48.712 --> 19:49.973
[Harriet] And did
Rodolfo Nùñez know this?

19:50.073 --> 19:51.175
[Gabrielle]
Yes.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.897
I showed him the report myself.

19:52.997 --> 19:55.180
[Harriet] And what did he do
with this information?

19:55.280 --> 19:56.441
-[Gabrielle] He buried it.
-[gallery murmuring]

19:57.723 --> 19:59.024

-[Pam] Objection.

19:59.124 --> 20:00.146
[Gabrielle]
As far as I'm concerned,

20:00.246 --> 20:02.549
he's responsible
for the death of

20:02.649 --> 20:03.830
half a million Americans.

20:03.930 --> 20:05.272
[Pam] Objection,
Your Honor. Speculative.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.834
-[judge] Sustained.
-[bangs gavel twice]

20:06.934 --> 20:08.837
[Harriet] I'd like
to submit items Number 146

20:08.937 --> 20:10.758
and 147 into evidence.

20:10.858 --> 20:12.681
Ms. Sheridan's report

20:12.781 --> 20:14.843
and a second report from
three months later that show

20:14.943 --> 20:16.926
vastly different results.

20:17.026 --> 20:19.449
-Ms. Sheridan?
-[Dani] [quietly] He lied.

20:19.549 --> 20:21.852
[Harriet] Is this the report
that you submitted?

20:21.952 --> 20:23.774
-[Gabrielle] It is.
-[Harriet] Could you please read

20:23.874 --> 20:25.497
-the highlighted portion for us?
-I'm not fine.

20:25.597 --> 20:27.820
[Gabrielle] Out of 200
individuals participating in...

20:27.920 --> 20:30.062
I need you
to get me out of here.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.185
-Let's go, come on. Come on.
-Yeah.

20:32.285 --> 20:34.508
[Gabrielle] ...in the U.S.,
an average of approximately

20:34.608 --> 20:37.551
21 to 29% of patients
who are prescribed opiates

20:37.651 --> 20:40.114
for chronic pain misuse them.

20:40.214 --> 20:41.997
A significant discrepancy

20:42.097 --> 20:45.481
between that range and the 41%
figure from this trial suggests

20:45.581 --> 20:47.283
that this drug is...

20:47.383 --> 20:48.725
[breathing heavily]

20:48.825 --> 20:50.827
-It's just too much.
-I know.

20:52.470 --> 20:53.971
-Too much.
-Hey. Hey,

20:54.071 --> 20:55.973
hey, hey, hey.

20:56.073 --> 20:57.415
-Just breathe.

20:57.515 --> 20:58.776
-I think I need to leave.
-[Gigi] Okay.

20:58.876 --> 21:01.019
No.

21:01.119 --> 21:03.222
No, I can't.

21:03.322 --> 21:05.144
-I can't leave.
-Hey. Hey. Hey.

21:05.244 --> 21:06.947
Look at me, look at me.

21:07.047 --> 21:08.349
Yes, you can.

21:08.449 --> 21:10.491
Okay? Let's go.

21:11.492 --> 21:12.794

That's not a good idea.

-I can't...

You're a subpoenaed witness.

-The judge could

21:17.900 --> 21:19.321
hold you in contempt.

21:19.421 --> 21:21.004
-You could get arrested...
-I know it's hard,

21:21.104 --> 21:22.686
but just try to be a fucking
human being for a second.

21:22.786 --> 21:24.528
Look at her.

21:24.628 --> 21:26.891
-She needs time.
-[Pam] We don't have time.

21:26.991 --> 21:28.994
That's your fucking problem.

21:29.434 --> 21:31.097
Want to go?

21:31.197 --> 21:33.178
-Let's go.
-[Pam] Dani?

21:33.278 --> 21:35.642
You'll be held in
criminal contempt of court.

21:36.603 --> 21:38.605
-They will find you.
-Go fuck yourself.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.322

Hey.

I'm sorry

22:13.928 --> 22:15.550
I blew up at you last night.

22:15.650 --> 22:17.432
It's just...

No, I... [sighs]

You know? It's okay.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.303
Thank you.

22:28.266 --> 22:31.009
Tess fired me today
because of...

22:31.109 --> 22:32.891
whatever is happening.

22:32.991 --> 22:34.573
I don't even know
what to call it.

22:34.673 --> 22:36.255
I'm sorry.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.358
Thank you. That's nice.

22:39.038 --> 22:40.620
You want some mac and cheese?

22:40.720 --> 22:42.143
Ooh.

22:42.243 --> 22:43.744
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

22:43.844 --> 22:45.226
Yeah. You know,
you're kind of good at that.

22:45.326 --> 22:46.948
-Thank you.
-Can you put hot dogs in it

22:47.048 --> 22:48.991
-like last time?
-I was gonna put peas in it.

22:49.091 --> 22:50.952
-[giggles]
-You need some veggies.

22:51.052 --> 22:52.795
You care so much about me.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.402

to worry about me.

do that. No, no, no, no. Sophie?

I'm just asking you to let me
handle this my own way.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.768
No, we have been doing it
your way.

24:09.868 --> 24:11.251

and it is so fucking annoying.

are you with me?!
