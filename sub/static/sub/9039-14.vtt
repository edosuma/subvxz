00:05.533 --> 00:07.067
EVERYBODY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

00:07.067 --> 00:08.067
WE'RE GOIN' TO CHURCH.

00:09.367 --> 00:11.667
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY, HERE.
TURN THAT OFF.

00:22.367 --> 00:25.000
- HOW COME DADDY NEVER
HAS TO GO TO CHURCH?

00:25.000 --> 00:28.400
- WHY DON'T YOU
ASK DADDY?

00:28.400 --> 00:33.200
- [mumbled]
I HAVE TO WORK, HONEY.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.200

HIS BUSINESS LUNCH.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.467
- I AM WORKING.
THERE'S A BIG GAME ON TODAY.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.467
- I THOUGHT IT DIDN'T
START UNTIL 1:00.

00:42.467 --> 00:47.467
- OKAY, YEAH,
BUT THERE'S A PREGAME.

00:47.467 --> 00:54.333
LOOK, I DON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO DO YOUR JOB, RIGHT?

00:54.333 --> 00:56.700
- ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
LET'S GO!

00:56.700 --> 00:58.033
CHURCH TIME!

00:58.033 --> 01:00.133
CHOP-CHOP.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.433
- YOU USUALLY
HIDE UPSTAIRS UNTIL WE LEAVE.

01:12.033 --> 01:15.000
A LITTLE MORE BRAZEN
IN YOUR BLASPHEMY.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.267
- DON'T TELL HIM
HOW TO DO HIS JOB.

01:18.267 --> 01:19.467
COME ON. LET'S GO.

01:19.467 --> 01:20.933
- HEY, WHAT...?

01:20.933 --> 01:22.233
I DON'T KNOW WHY GOD

01:22.233 --> 01:24.133
PUT CHURCH AND FOOTBALL
AT THE SAME TIME.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.667
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
BRING THAT UP TODAY.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.333
- COME ON, KIDS!
WAIT UP; WAIT UP, KIDS!

01:40.100 --> 01:45.067

SCRATCHING HIMSELF.

01:45.067 --> 01:48.167
ALL MY LOVE,
ALL MY--MY CARING.

01:48.167 --> 01:51.233
I POURED MY HEART
INTO THIS BOY.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.567
THIS IS MY ONE REGRET
AS A PARENT.

02:01.767 --> 02:04.633
- I'M THE ONE
GOIN' TO CHURCH!

02:08.767 --> 02:13.800
[gentle piano music]

02:13.800 --> 02:15.467
- WHAT'D YOU DO THERE?

02:18.067 --> 02:19.600

03:04.167 --> 03:06.500
- HEY, DEBRA, LOOK.
LOOK AT THIS.

03:06.500 --> 03:07.567
- WHAT?

03:07.567 --> 03:11.400
- YOU'RE IN JAIL.
LOOK AT THAT.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.000
- GOIN' ON TEN YEARS NOW.
YEAH.

03:18.367 --> 03:22.267
HONEY, SHOW DADDY
YOUR PICTURE.

03:22.267 --> 03:25.400
- OH...DID YOU DRAW THIS?
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.667
YOU'RE QUITE
THE LITTLE ARTIST.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.000
- YEAH, TELL DADDY
WHAT IT IS.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.167
- NO, NO, NO.
LET ME GUESS.

03:30.167 --> 03:33.333
UH, THAT'S
A BIG ORANGE WALL.

03:33.333 --> 03:34.600
- IT'S FIRE.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.333
- FIRE. YES, OF COURSE,
IT'S FIRE.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.233
IT'S A BIG WALL OF FIRE,

03:38.233 --> 03:39.633
AND THAT MUST BE
THE FIREMAN.

03:39.633 --> 03:42.500
- ACTUALLY, ALLY TOLD ME
IT'S A PICTURE OF HELL.

03:47.933 --> 03:49.033
- YOU--

03:49.033 --> 03:52.533
YOU MEAN "HECK," RIGHT?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.667
RIGHT, ALLY?

03:53.667 --> 03:56.400
SO IS THAT THE DEVIL?

03:56.400 --> 03:59.000
- NOPE. IT'S YOU.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.667
- ME? I--

04:02.667 --> 04:03.933
I--I'M...

04:03.933 --> 04:07.067
WHY AM I IN HECK,
SWEETIE?

04:07.067 --> 04:12.267
- BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT GRANDPA SAID.

04:12.267 --> 04:13.800
- GRANDPA SAID THAT?

04:13.800 --> 04:16.200
WHAT? GRANDPA TOLD YOU
THAT I'M GOING TO HECK?

04:16.200 --> 04:19.600
- HE SAID, "HELL."

04:19.600 --> 04:20.600
- REALLY?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.600
REALLY? WHY DID
GRANDPA SAY THAT?

04:22.600 --> 04:25.100
- 'CAUSE YOU
DON'T GO TO CHURCH.

04:25.100 --> 04:28.100
- GRANDPA SAID THAT?

04:28.100 --> 04:29.967
WHERE WERE YOU?

04:29.967 --> 04:32.500
- I WAS IN CHURCH.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.967
- OKAY, I'M GONNA, UH,

04:36.967 --> 04:38.133
I'M GONNA GO
ACROSS THE STREET

04:38.133 --> 04:39.700

04:39.700 --> 04:43.300
IF I'M GONNA GO TO HECK,
I'M TAKIN' HIM WITH ME.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.167
- MARIE!

05:04.167 --> 05:06.700
- GO AHEAD, FRANK!

05:13.700 --> 05:17.033
MMM! MMM.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.367
- ALL RIGHT, DAD.

05:18.367 --> 05:19.633
WHY DID YOU
TELL ALLY THAT--

05:19.633 --> 05:21.000
- YOU WANT SOME CAKE?
- NO.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.633
- GOOD.

05:23.633 --> 05:24.967
SEE THIS PICTURE, DAD?

05:24.967 --> 05:27.033
IT'S A PICTURE
OF ME IN HELL.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.333
MY SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER DREW IT

05:28.333 --> 05:29.800
BECAUSE HER GRANDPA
TOLD HER

05:29.800 --> 05:31.467
THAT'S WHERE
HER FATHER'S GOIN':

05:31.467 --> 05:32.433
TO HELL!

05:32.433 --> 05:34.400
WHAT KIND OF A MIND
DOES THAT?

05:34.400 --> 05:39.600
- MMM! THIS CAKE ALMOST
MAKES MARRIAGE BEARABLE.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.000
HEY!

05:41.000 --> 05:42.367
- WHY DID YOU TELL HER THAT?

05:42.367 --> 05:45.133
- I NEVER TOLD HER
YOU WERE GOING THERE.

05:45.133 --> 05:46.733
SHE ASKED ME
WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE

05:46.733 --> 05:47.933
WHO DON'T GO TO CHURCH.

05:47.933 --> 05:51.267
I SAID,
"THEY GO TO HELL, SWEETIE."

05:51.267 --> 05:55.100
SHE MUST HAVE
PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

05:55.100 --> 05:59.100
SMART KID.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.600
- GO--GO OVER THERE
RIGHT NOW

06:00.600 --> 06:02.400
AND TELL HER
THAT I'M NOT GOIN' TO HELL!

06:02.400 --> 06:04.100
- YOU KNOW,
I WOULD LOVE TO,

06:04.100 --> 06:06.433
BUT I DON'T
MAKE THE RULES.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.967
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHIPPED CREAM.

06:11.967 --> 06:14.500
- HEY, YOU REALLY THINK
THAT I'M GOIN' TO HELL?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.100
- I TRY NOT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.133
- LOOK, HEY, I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU THINK, ALL RIGHT?

06:18.133 --> 06:19.467
I DON'T WANT YOU
TALKIN' TO MY KIDS

06:19.467 --> 06:21.400
ABOUT THIS STUFF ANYMORE;
YOU GOT THAT?

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
- SINCE WHEN
DO YOU GIVE ME ORDERS?

06:24.000 --> 06:25.800
- SINCE YOU CROSSED
OVER THE LINE.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.267
- HI, RAYMOND. YOU HUNGRY?
HAVE SOME CAKE.

06:28.267 --> 06:30.233
- I DON'T WANT ANY CAKE!

06:30.233 --> 06:33.233
- WE HAVE WHIPPED CREAM.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.467
- HOW ABOUT THIS, MARIE.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.967
YOUR SON DOESN'T
WANT ME TALKIN'

06:35.967 --> 06:37.433
TO MY OWN GRANDCHILDREN.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.267
- OH?

06:38.267 --> 06:39.733
- THAT ISN'T WHAT I SAID.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.700
- I'LL TALK TO ANYONE
I WANT ANYTIME I WANT.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.133
- UNFORTUNATELY, RAYMOND,
THIS IS AMERICA.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.567
- MOM, I DON'T WANT HIM
TELLIN' ALLY--

06:46.567 --> 06:48.267
- HEY, HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

06:48.267 --> 06:50.967
ARE YOU TALKIN'
TO MY WIFE?

06:50.967 --> 06:52.067
- WHAT?

06:52.067 --> 06:53.467
- DON'T TALK TO MY WIFE.

06:53.467 --> 06:56.133
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
DAD, DON'T BE CUTE.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.000
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
YOU WANT TO BE LIKE THAT,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.300
YOU DON'T TALK TO HER.

06:59.300 --> 07:01.633
ONLY I TALK TO HER.

07:01.633 --> 07:05.467
HELLO, SWEETHEART.
HOW ARE YOU?

07:05.467 --> 07:08.200
- OH, I'M FINE, BUT, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A THING THAT--

07:08.200 --> 07:09.333
- OH, STOP IT, MOM!

07:09.333 --> 07:10.833
HE DOESN'T CARE
HOW YOU ARE!

07:10.833 --> 07:12.233
- HEY!

07:12.233 --> 07:14.267
YOU'RE TALKIN' TO HER.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.567
STOP TALKIN' TO HER.

07:16.567 --> 07:17.933
- NO. IT'S ALL RIGHT,
FRANK.

07:17.933 --> 07:19.267
HE CAN TALK TO ME

07:19.267 --> 07:21.533
UNLESS YOU WANT TO
TALK TO ME SOME MORE.

07:21.533 --> 07:25.000
I LIKED IT.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.733
- I WAS JUST MAKING A POINT.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.433
- DAD TOLD ALLY
THAT I AM GOING TO HELL.

07:33.433 --> 07:35.167
- FRANK.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.167
- HE NEVER GOES
TO MASS, MARIE.

07:37.167 --> 07:38.733
IT'S AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.

07:38.733 --> 07:40.033
- YOU SEE? YOU SEE, MA?

07:40.033 --> 07:41.767
- NO, YOU SHOULD GO
TO MASS, RAYMOND.

07:41.767 --> 07:44.167
- I DON'T WANT TO GO!

07:44.167 --> 07:46.700
- WHY DO YOU HURT ME?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.400
- LOOK, I DON'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU, MOM--

07:51.400 --> 07:53.333
- STOP HURTING YOUR MOTHER.
GO TO CHURCH.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.367
- NO!
- OH! OOH...

07:55.367 --> 07:56.667
OH...

07:56.667 --> 07:58.767
- LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOIN' TO HER.
GO TO CHURCH!

07:58.767 --> 08:01.000
- NO, NO!
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.400
- "I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT."

08:02.400 --> 08:04.100
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOU KIDS TODAY.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.567
EVERYTHING HAS TO FEEL GOOD.

08:05.567 --> 08:08.133
DO YOU THINK
WORLD WAR II FELT GOOD?

08:08.133 --> 08:09.967
DO YOU THINK KOREA
FELT GOOD?

08:09.967 --> 08:12.733
IN MY DAY,
NOTHING FELT GOOD!

08:12.733 --> 08:14.267
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR DAY

08:14.267 --> 08:17.233
AND STOP RUINING MINE?

08:17.233 --> 08:19.567
- 12 YEARS OF CATHOLIC SCHOOL
DOWN THE TOILET.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.500
GO TO CHURCH!

08:21.500 --> 08:24.600
- FRANK, YOU CAN'T JUST SCREAM
AT SOMEONE TO GO TO CHURCH.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.367
- WELL, 40 YEARS
OF YOUR GUILT HASN'T WORKED.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.733
- I NEED MORE TIME.

08:29.733 --> 08:32.833
- LOOK, I--ALL I'M SAYIN' IS,
FROM NOW ON,

08:32.833 --> 08:36.133
IF ALLY ASKS YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT RELIGIOUS STUFF

08:36.133 --> 08:39.033
OR GOVERNMENT OR MINORITIES,

08:39.033 --> 08:40.867
PLEASE REFER HER TO ME!

08:40.867 --> 08:42.367
- HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

08:42.367 --> 08:44.433
IT'S EMBARRASSING.
I'M IN CHURCH.

08:44.433 --> 08:46.433
PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
"HOW COME RAY'S NEVER HERE?

08:46.433 --> 08:48.300
DIDN'T YOU
RAISE HIM RIGHT?"

08:48.300 --> 08:50.767
- THEY SAY THAT?
- SHUT UP.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.633
- YEAH.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.333
LOOK, I'M NOT GOIN'
JUST TO MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD.

08:55.333 --> 08:57.733
- GO TO CHURCH!
- NO!

08:57.733 --> 08:59.300
- THEN THOU ARE DOOMED

08:59.300 --> 09:02.333
TO SUFFER THE FIRES
OF ETERNAL DAMNATION.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.067
- SEE, NOW, I WOULD NEVER SCREAM
AT YOU LIKE THAT, RAYMOND,

09:15.067 --> 09:17.733
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOUR FAILURES...

09:17.733 --> 09:20.033
ARE MY FAULT.

09:29.467 --> 09:32.400
[spoon scraping]

09:37.533 --> 09:39.267
- THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHOLE THING.

09:40.600 --> 09:41.933
YOU MARRIED A MAN.

09:41.933 --> 09:44.967
- HMM.

09:44.967 --> 09:48.867
- "24 GRAMS OF FAT."

09:48.867 --> 09:50.233
YEAH, BUT DON'T WORRY.

09:50.233 --> 09:55.200
I'LL BE BURNING IT OFF...
IN HELL.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.433
OKAY, I'M GOIN' UP.

09:56.433 --> 09:57.633
- OKAY.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.467
- YOU KNOW, I KIND OF UNDERSTAND
HOW YOUR FATHER FEELS.

10:05.067 --> 10:06.267
- OKAY, GOOD NIGHT.

10:06.267 --> 10:09.133
- NO, RAY.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.133
- OH! EH...

10:12.300 --> 10:14.233
- YOU STILL CONSIDER
YOURSELF CATHOLIC?

10:14.233 --> 10:15.800
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.133
UH, YEAH, I'M CATHOLIC.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

10:18.133 --> 10:20.433
IT'S LIKE BEING ITALIAN

10:20.433 --> 10:22.600
OR--OR...

10:22.600 --> 10:24.400
SEXY.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.667
- SO WHY DON'T
YOU GO TO MASS?

10:31.667 --> 10:34.733
- COME ON, LOOK, IT'S NOT
LIKE I NEVER GO, RIGHT?

10:34.733 --> 10:36.233
AND YOU GO ALL THE TIME,

10:36.233 --> 10:38.567
AND ACCORDING
TO THIS MARRIED THING,

10:38.567 --> 10:40.100
WE ARE ONE.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.300
- OKAY, NO, YOU KNOW,

10:44.300 --> 10:45.733
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE A BIG THING.

10:45.733 --> 10:47.400
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FATHER

10:47.400 --> 10:49.333
AND, YOU KNOW,
WHY YOU GOT SO ANGRY ABOUT IT.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.433
- BECAUSE IT'S NONE
OF HIS BUSINESS.

10:51.433 --> 10:52.933
- WHY DON'T YOU
GO TO CHURCH?

10:52.933 --> 10:55.267
- I DON'T KNOW. I--

10:55.267 --> 10:57.600
IT'S--IT'S BECAUSE
OF THE KNEELING, REALLY.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.467
IT'S JUST--YOU KNOW
I HAVE BAD KNEES.

11:02.067 --> 11:05.967
- YOU KNOW,
GOD CAN HEAR YOU RIGHT NOW.

11:05.967 --> 11:09.133
- LET ME FINISH.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.667
ALL RIGHT?

11:12.567 --> 11:14.067
THAT'S NOT
THE ONLY REASON.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.533
THAT'S--
THAT'S ONE OF 'EM.

11:16.533 --> 11:19.033
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
WHEN I GO--

11:19.033 --> 11:20.333
WHEN I GO THERE,

11:20.333 --> 11:22.700
I SHOULD BE THINKING
ABOUT GOD, RIGHT?

11:22.700 --> 11:26.133
BUT INSTEAD I'M THINKING ABOUT
SOME COLUMN I'M WORKIN' ON,

11:26.133 --> 11:27.967
UH, "WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS GUY'S SCALP?

11:27.967 --> 11:30.200
"OH, THAT LADY SNEEZED.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.833
I'M NOT SHAKING
HER HAND."

11:32.833 --> 11:34.467
I'M NOT FOCUSED.

11:34.467 --> 11:36.767
I FEEL LIKE I'M JUST GOING
THROUGH THE MOTIONS,

11:36.767 --> 11:39.900
AND THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT RESPECTFUL, RIGHT?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.133
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:41.133 --> 11:42.633
I MEAN, YOU SHOULDN'T GO

11:42.633 --> 11:46.033
IF YOU'RE JUST GOIN'
THROUGH THE MOTIONS.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.200
- WHAT? I'M AGREEING
WITH YOU.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.133
- NO, YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.267
- NO, I'M NOT.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.167
- YOU'RE
JUST LIKE MY MOTHER.

11:55.167 --> 11:58.300
- WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO INSULT ME?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.933
WE'RE TALKING.

12:01.933 --> 12:05.300
AND, BESIDES,
YOU'RE THE ONE

12:05.300 --> 12:06.900
THAT HAD TO EAT
A WHOLE PINT OF ICE CREAM.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.533
IF YOU'RE FEELING GUILTY,
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF ME.

12:09.533 --> 12:12.533
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.867
I PRACTICE BEING A GOOD PERSON
EVERY DAY, OKAY?

12:15.867 --> 12:17.867
I'M A DECENT FELLOW.

12:17.867 --> 12:21.133
I--I DO GOOD THINGS.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.367
I ALWAYS
LEAVE A BIG TIP.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.167
IF A SQUIRREL RUNS
IN FRONT OF THE CAR,

12:25.167 --> 12:27.667
DO I NOT SWERVE?

12:27.667 --> 12:30.833
I'M CONSIDERATE
OF PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

12:30.833 --> 12:34.233
REMEMBER THE PLUMBER
WHO CAME OVER WITH THE BIG EYE?

12:34.233 --> 12:38.633
I TREATED HIM LIKE A COMPLETELY
NORMAL PERSON, OKAY?

12:38.633 --> 12:41.700
SO WHY DO I HAVE
TO GO TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY

12:41.700 --> 12:43.000
TO PROVE MY GOODNESS?

12:43.000 --> 12:44.367
I'M LIVING IT.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.767
- WELL, YOU KNOW, SINCE
YOU ARE SO GOOD DURING THE WEEK,

12:50.767 --> 12:55.033
MAYBE ON SUNDAYS, WE SHOULD
HAVE EVERYBODY COME OVER HERE

12:55.033 --> 12:57.167
AND SIT AROUND YOU.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.433
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

13:02.433 --> 13:04.967
WHY DO YOU GO,
MISS HOLY...

13:04.967 --> 13:07.833
MOLY?

13:07.833 --> 13:09.467
- WHY DO I GO?

13:09.467 --> 13:10.567
- YEAH.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.300
- I GO, YOU KNOW,
TO THANK GOD

13:13.300 --> 13:15.433
FOR YOU AND THE KIDS

13:15.433 --> 13:17.367
AND TO PRAY FOR THE STRENGTH

13:17.367 --> 13:19.600
TO GET THROUGH ANOTHER WEEK
WITH YOU AND THE KIDS.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.167
- OKAY. YEAH.

13:21.167 --> 13:22.667
- NO. NO, REALLY.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.833
YOU KNOW,
I GO TO GET RE-ENERGIZED,

13:25.833 --> 13:28.033
TO BE PART OF SOMETHING
THAT'S BIGGER THAN ME

13:28.033 --> 13:30.000
AND MY LITTLE PROBLEMS.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.300
YOU KNOW, IT REMINDS ME

13:31.300 --> 13:33.067
THAT I'M NOT
THE BE-ALL AND END-ALL.

13:33.067 --> 13:36.000
THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE
THAT'S GREATER THAN ME.

13:38.367 --> 13:42.933
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
HAVE AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING?

13:42.933 --> 13:44.500
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?

13:44.500 --> 13:47.367
I LIKE THE FEELING
OF COMMUNITY, THE TRADITION,

13:47.367 --> 13:50.367
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S
BUGGING YOUR FATHER.

13:50.367 --> 13:53.233
YOU KNOW, HE WANTED TO PASS
HIS FAITH ONTO YOU.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.233
IT'S PROBABLY
THE ONLY VALUABLE THING

13:55.233 --> 13:57.233
THAT HE THINKS
HE CAN GIVE YOU,

13:57.233 --> 14:01.100
AND YOU'VE REJECTED IT.

14:01.100 --> 14:04.100
- OKAY, I NEED MORE ICE CREAM.

14:07.033 --> 14:08.400
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE

14:08.400 --> 14:10.133
WOULD HAVE MADE FUN
OF THAT PLUMBER, OKAY?

14:10.133 --> 14:12.167
BIG MUPPET-EYE GUY.

14:17.967 --> 14:20.033
- HEY, YOU WORKIN' THE CHURCH
CARNIVAL NEXT WEEKEND?

14:20.033 --> 14:23.200
- YEAH, MY WIFE SIGNED ME UP
FOR THE DUNKING BOOTH AGAIN.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.600
SHE LOVES SEEING ME WET.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.333
- HEY, RAY'S HERE!
[laughs]

14:34.167 --> 14:37.400
- AND ALSO WITH YOU.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.033
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

14:39.033 --> 14:41.100
- NOTHING. GOING TO CHURCH.

14:41.100 --> 14:42.300
- HOW COME?

14:42.300 --> 14:44.333
- I...JUST FELT LIKE IT.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.200
- YEAH, WELL, WE DON'T NEED
YOU PART-TIMERS

14:46.200 --> 14:48.000
DROPPING BY
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
IT SCREWS UP THE PARKING.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.967
- I'M THINKIN' OF MAKING THIS
A REGULAR THING.

14:54.967 --> 14:57.900
- YEAH, RIGHT.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.533
- NO, I'M SERIOUS.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.633
- YOU WANT
TO COME EVERY SUNDAY?

15:01.633 --> 15:03.100
- DO THEY HAVE IT
EVERY SUNDAY?

15:03.100 --> 15:05.667
YEAH. EVERY SUNDAY.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.233
- YEAH, UNTIL YOUR MOTHER'S
GUILT WEARS OFF.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.333
- NO, NO, IT WASN'T HER.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.667
LOOK, YOU
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

15:12.667 --> 15:14.600
IT WAS YOU.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.533
I WANT TO SET AN EXAMPLE
FOR MY KIDS, YOU KNOW,

15:18.533 --> 15:20.367
LIKE YOU DID.

15:20.367 --> 15:24.500
- WHAT ARE YOU,
BEING A WISE GUY?

15:24.500 --> 15:27.533
- NO. I MEAN IT.

15:27.533 --> 15:29.667
- OH, YEAH?

15:29.667 --> 15:32.100
- YEAH.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.533
- LOOK AT YOU.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.700
- MMM!

15:35.700 --> 15:39.100
- US BARONES,
WE CLEAN UP PRETTY GOOD, EH?

15:40.533 --> 15:42.167
- HEY, IT'S THE OFFERTORY,
PEOPLE.

15:42.167 --> 15:43.367
WHERE ARE MY USHERS?

15:43.367 --> 15:44.767
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

15:44.767 --> 15:45.767
GET THE LEAD OUT.
COME ON.

15:45.767 --> 15:47.167
COME ON.
GO, GO, GO, GO!

15:47.167 --> 15:48.700
- FATHER HUBLEY,
GOOD NEWS.

15:48.700 --> 15:53.067
RAYMOND MY SON
IS COMING BACK TO THE CHURCH.

15:53.067 --> 15:56.067
- REALLY?

15:57.533 --> 15:58.967
- EVERY SUNDAY.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.367
- WELCOME BACK, RAYMOND.

16:04.633 --> 16:06.900
FRANK, YOU WAITING
FOR AN ENGRAVED INVITATION?

16:06.900 --> 16:09.167
COME ON.

16:16.733 --> 16:17.967
- WELL, WELL, WELL,

16:17.967 --> 16:20.400
THE PRODIGAL SON RETURNS.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.500
OF COURSE,
NO ONE APPLAUDS A FAITHFUL SON,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.767
BECAUSE THE FAITHFUL SON
NEVER LEAVES.

16:25.767 --> 16:29.633
- THE FAITHFUL SON
HAS NOWHERE TO GO.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.567
- SO WHAT'S YOUR ANGLE,
RAYMOND?

16:33.567 --> 16:35.733
- NOTHIN'.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT DAD AND--

16:35.733 --> 16:37.700
- OH, YOU'RE COMIN' BACK
BECAUSE OF DAD.

16:37.700 --> 16:40.233
- YEAH. EVERY SUNDAY.
THAT'S RIGHT.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.700
- AND YOU'RE GONNA
SIT IN THE PEWS

16:41.700 --> 16:42.700
AND BE WITH THE FAMILY?

16:42.700 --> 16:44.833
- HEY, IF DAD CAN DO IT,
I CAN DO IT.

16:44.833 --> 16:47.067
- [chuckling]

16:47.067 --> 16:48.300
- WHAT?

16:48.300 --> 16:49.967
- DAD DOESN'T DO IT.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.033
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:53.033 --> 16:54.267
- I DO IT.

16:54.267 --> 16:55.800
MOM, DEBRA,
THE KIDS DO IT.

16:55.800 --> 16:58.467
BUT DAD?
HE'S AN USHER.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.800
- SO?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.967
- SO THAT MEANS HE SPENDS
MOST OF HIS TIME OUT HERE,

17:01.967 --> 17:03.467
NOT IN THERE.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.467
BACK HERE, HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT--

17:05.467 --> 17:08.200
AS HE PUTS IT--
"MUMBO JUMBO."

17:11.133 --> 17:12.600
- GOD OF ALL CREATION.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.967
[people chanting]

17:14.967 --> 17:16.367
- THAT'S RIGHT, RAY.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.067
OH, YEAH, OCCASIONALLY,
HE'LL GO DOWN THE AISLE

17:18.067 --> 17:19.167
WITH THE COLLECTION BASKET

17:19.167 --> 17:20.633
AND WINK
AT THE PRETTY LADIES,

17:20.633 --> 17:21.600
AND HE HUSTLES BACK

17:21.600 --> 17:23.967
TO COUNT THE MONEY
AND CLOCKS OUT.

17:23.967 --> 17:25.933
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SET-UP.

17:25.933 --> 17:28.300
MOM CAN'T GET ON HIS CASE
FOR NOT GOING TO MASS.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.000
HE'S HERE EVERY SUNDAY
SERVING THE LORD.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.600
HE'S JUST DOIN' IT
FROM THE FIRST-CLASS LOUNGE.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.600
- OH, MY GOD.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.800
DEBRA TOLD ME THIS WAS
THE BEST PART OF HIM.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.067
- WELL...

17:45.067 --> 17:48.800
- I KNEW THERE
WAS NO BEST PART OF HIM.

17:48.800 --> 17:53.333
OH, AND I JUST PROMISED
IN FRONT OF GOD AND EVERYBODY.

17:53.333 --> 17:57.400
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
COUNT 'EM UP!

17:57.400 --> 18:00.467
- HEY, FRANK, GET A LOAD
OF ROSEANNE KELLY TODAY?

18:00.467 --> 18:01.433
WHOO-OOH.

18:01.433 --> 18:02.900
- YEAH. WITH
THE LOW-CUT THING?

18:02.900 --> 18:04.433
I ALMOST GAVE HER A DOLLAR.

18:04.433 --> 18:06.200
[laughter]

18:06.200 --> 18:08.700
- PRAISE THE LORD!
[laughter]

18:08.700 --> 18:11.667
- LOOKS LIKE
I'M AHEAD HERE, BOYS.

18:11.667 --> 18:15.333
OOH, LOOK AT THIS,
A $50 BILL.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.033
SOMEONE DID SOMETHIN'
TO SOMEBODY.

18:18.033 --> 18:20.267
- HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
THIS IS IT?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.867
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO
EVERY SUNDAY?

18:22.867 --> 18:24.333
- WHAT?
- THIS.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.200
THIS--LAUGHIN' AND--
AND TALKIN' ABOUT WOMEN

18:26.200 --> 18:28.867
AND BETTIN' ON WHO COLLECTED
THE MOST MONEY?

18:28.867 --> 18:30.867
ISN'T THIS WHERE JESUS
IS SUPPOSED TO COME IN

18:30.867 --> 18:33.000
AND TURN
THIS TABLE OVER?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.933
- SINCE WHEN
DID YOU START WEARIN' SANDALS?

18:37.933 --> 18:41.433
- [laughs]

18:41.433 --> 18:43.333
- YOU'RE SO FULL OF IT, DAD,
YOU KNOW?

18:43.333 --> 18:44.667
ACTING ALL HIGH
AND MIGHTY,

18:44.667 --> 18:46.367
TELLIN' ME THAT
I'M GONNA BURN IN...

18:46.367 --> 18:48.400
YOU KNOW WHERE,
THIS IS IT?

18:48.400 --> 18:49.667
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED
TO PASS ONTO ME,

18:49.667 --> 18:51.100
YOUR LITTLE
SPORTSMAN'S LODGE?

18:51.100 --> 18:52.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.733
I'M NOT GOIN'
TO CHURCH, OKAY?

18:53.733 --> 18:54.933
'CAUSE I DON'T
NEED YOUR HYPOCRISY.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.133
- "HYPOCRISY."

18:56.133 --> 18:59.100
- OOH, HYPOCRISY. OOH!

18:59.100 --> 19:00.967
- WHO ARE YOU TO JUDGE?

19:00.967 --> 19:03.067
THERE'S NO HYPOCRISY.

19:03.067 --> 19:04.367
I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO THE LORD,

19:04.367 --> 19:05.933
AND I'M HERE
EVERY SUNDAY, HELPING.

19:05.933 --> 19:08.167
IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR
COMMITMENT TO YOUR FAMILY,

19:08.167 --> 19:10.200
TO FATHER HUBLEY,
AND TO GOD,

19:10.200 --> 19:11.867
GO RIGHT AHEAD.

19:11.867 --> 19:13.000
DON'T WORRY.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.633
IT'S A DRY HEAT.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.300
- FINE. ALL RIGHT.

19:18.300 --> 19:19.633
I'M NOT GONNA
BREAK MY COMMITMENT.

19:19.633 --> 19:21.200
I SAID
I'M COMING EVERY WEEK,

19:21.200 --> 19:22.667
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I'M GONNA DO.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.100
NOT ONLY THAT,

19:27.100 --> 19:29.733
I WOULD LIKE TO VOLUNTEER
TO BE AN USHER.

19:29.733 --> 19:30.967
- WHAT?

19:30.967 --> 19:32.133
- I WANT TO BE AN USHER.
COME ON, DAD.

19:32.133 --> 19:33.333
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.800
YOU AND ME,
WE COULD USHER TOGETHER.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.567
- YOU MEAN, YOU WANNA BE
AN USHER LIKE YOUR OLD MAN?

19:37.567 --> 19:38.667
[laughter]

19:38.667 --> 19:41.433
- WHAT? WHY?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

19:41.433 --> 19:43.200
- YOU KNOW HOW LONG
THE WAITING LIST IS?

19:43.200 --> 19:47.267
IT TOOK ME 20 YEARS
TO BECOME AN USHER.

19:47.267 --> 19:50.067
- OH, OH,
WELL, I COULD BE A FILL-IN GUY,

19:50.067 --> 19:51.933
YOU KNOW, FOR WHEN SOMEBODY
GETS SICK.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.300
YOU DON'T
LOOK SO GOOD.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.800
- SORRY, KID, I PROMISED THAT
TO YOUR BROTHER.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.667
- OH, I HATE THAT GUY.

20:03.667 --> 20:06.200
- LOOK, YOU ALREADY MISSED
HALF THE MASS HERE.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.000
COME ON, YOU BETTER
GET BACK IN THERE

20:08.000 --> 20:09.733
IF YOU WANT THIS ONE
TO COUNT.

20:09.733 --> 20:11.067
- ALL RIGHT, BUT--BUT--

20:11.067 --> 20:14.200
- HEY, LOOK, I GOT A LOT OF WORK
TO DO HERE, SON.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.200
GO AND JOIN YOUR FAMILY.

20:20.433 --> 20:23.167
- ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

20:27.333 --> 20:29.933
- ANYBODY WATCH
THE KNICKS GAME LAST NIGHT?

20:29.933 --> 20:32.433
- YEAH.
IT WAS GREAT.

20:37.967 --> 20:40.700
- FATHER, YOU ARE HOLY INDEED,

20:40.700 --> 20:42.833
AND ALL CREATION RIGHTLY
GIVES YOU PRAISE.

20:42.833 --> 20:43.867
- WHAT?

20:43.867 --> 20:45.267
- NOTHING.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.667
THIS IS NICE.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.167
- ...THROUGH YOUR SON
JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD.

20:49.167 --> 20:51.167
BY THE WORKING
OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,

20:51.167 --> 20:52.400
FROM AGE TO AGE

20:52.400 --> 20:54.467
YOU GATHER A PEOPLE TO YOURSELF.

20:54.467 --> 20:57.133
SO THAT FROM EAST TO WEST...

20:59.067 --> 21:01.400
TO THE GLORY OF YOUR NAME.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.533
[sermon continues indistinctly]
