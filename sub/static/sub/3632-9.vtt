00:02.211 --> 00:04.085
- What am I pregnant with?
- A werewolf.

00:04.117 --> 00:05.917
Paige: Witches believe in the
prophecy of the Undoing.

00:05.919 --> 00:07.185
A male child born to a witch

00:07.187 --> 00:09.086
is destined to bring about our downfall.

00:09.088 --> 00:10.821
Clay: We killed you.

00:10.823 --> 00:12.990
Aleister: With your help,
I'll get what I need.

00:12.992 --> 00:14.792
A great woman taught me this spell.

00:14.794 --> 00:17.361
You don't have any control
over your body. I do.

00:17.363 --> 00:18.962
This isn't you.

00:18.964 --> 00:20.731
Aleister: I have you locked
away inside your mind.

00:20.733 --> 00:22.366
Man: We think that Aleister's still alive

00:22.368 --> 00:25.002
and that he's possessed
Clay to take Savannah.

00:25.004 --> 00:26.703
Ruth: He's gonna try to kill Clay

00:26.705 --> 00:28.772
within a dark circle that
he's drawn on the floor.

00:28.774 --> 00:31.041
The man you love is already dead.

00:31.043 --> 00:32.442
Jeremy: It's over, Aleister.

00:32.444 --> 00:33.643
You took my son.

00:33.645 --> 00:34.978
And now you're going to die.

00:34.980 --> 00:37.247
(Screaming) Stop!
(Screaming)

00:37.249 --> 00:39.716
Aleister wasn't able
to control us as wolves.

00:39.718 --> 00:40.983
What if Clay can change?

00:40.985 --> 00:43.820
(Groaning, growling)

00:43.822 --> 00:45.121
Elena: Clay?

00:45.123 --> 00:46.489
It's him.

00:57.767 --> 01:00.236
(Music box plays)

01:00.238 --> 01:03.505
Aleister: Okay, watch your step...

01:03.507 --> 01:06.909
(Giggling, soft panting)

01:06.911 --> 01:10.713
(Music box music)

01:17.487 --> 01:19.355
Oh... Wow!

01:20.690 --> 01:22.257
This is crazy.

01:22.259 --> 01:23.859
Aleister: I'm glad you like it.

01:23.861 --> 01:25.861
What is this place? It's like...

01:25.863 --> 01:28.564
out of a gothic novel or something.

01:29.733 --> 01:32.767

03:15.601 --> 03:17.902
Woman: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

03:17.904 --> 03:19.504
Who the hell are you?

What is this?

03:26.879 --> 03:28.145
(Whimper)

03:29.682 --> 03:31.248
Okay, let me out.

Stop!

03:32.586 --> 03:34.018
Stop, let me out!

03:36.121 --> 03:37.722
Clara: This one's perfect.

03:37.724 --> 03:39.190
No, stop! I want to go home!

03:39.192 --> 03:41.292
Aleister: Shhh. Quiet, now.

03:41.294 --> 03:44.161
Are you ready to take her, Clara?

03:44.163 --> 03:47.231
Yes...

03:47.233 --> 03:48.466
I want her.

<i>Jeremy: The witches said</i>

04:44.002 --> 04:45.768
it was the only way.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.608
There's no way you could have known.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.243
I almost killed you.

04:54.245 --> 04:56.745
You almost killed <i>Aleister.</i>

04:56.747 --> 04:59.948
Okay? We're going to
find him and end this.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.283
We will.

05:01.285 --> 05:03.085
Just to make sure you're okay first.

05:06.189 --> 05:09.692
(Distorted rumbling)

05:09.694 --> 05:10.892
Clay, something wrong?

05:10.894 --> 05:12.260
Elena: Is it a concussion?

05:12.262 --> 05:13.962
My eyes.

05:13.964 --> 05:16.064
The photoreceptors shifted.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.634
I'm fine.

05:22.571 --> 05:25.207
I do not understand
how you are still alive

05:25.209 --> 05:27.942
- after a possession. It's...
- Aleister was surprised, too.

05:27.944 --> 05:29.510
He told me so himself.

05:29.512 --> 05:31.346
He appeared to you? What did he say?

05:31.348 --> 05:33.414
It's foggy. He said
something about a woman,

05:33.416 --> 05:35.483
a great woman who taught
him everything he knows.

05:35.485 --> 05:36.884
Is that Clara?

05:36.886 --> 05:38.553
We have to find her.

05:38.555 --> 05:41.088
And what if she doesn't
lead us back to Aleister?

05:41.090 --> 05:43.290
The Undoing has begun.

05:43.292 --> 05:46.160
I can feel across the Nexus

05:46.162 --> 05:49.130
all the other witches growing weaker.

05:50.766 --> 05:53.968
Unless we kill him by sunrise,

05:53.970 --> 05:56.203
all the witches will be dead.

06:05.613 --> 06:07.013
Just give me a minute.

06:12.186 --> 06:14.488
Hey.

06:14.490 --> 06:16.489
I've been looking all over for you.
You okay?

06:16.491 --> 06:18.892
Logan, when I said I
needed space, I meant it.

06:18.894 --> 06:20.426
You shouldn't be here.

06:20.428 --> 06:22.561
I know, I just couldn't
stop thinking about you.

06:22.563 --> 06:24.130
I was worried.

06:24.132 --> 06:25.899
I need my life back.
And I can't do it with...

06:25.901 --> 06:27.400
Honey, everything's okay, we're safe,

06:27.402 --> 06:28.902
I've made sure of it, I love you.

06:28.904 --> 06:30.469
And I loved you.
And where did it get me?

06:30.471 --> 06:32.538
Kidnapped, experimented on,

06:32.540 --> 06:35.541
used in twisted rituals
because of what you are!

06:37.210 --> 06:39.812
I know, it's not your fault
and you can't help it.

06:39.814 --> 06:42.848
But I... I can't help how I feel.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.584
Rachel, please, just let me fix this.

06:45.586 --> 06:47.620
We have a baby on the way...

06:47.622 --> 06:48.754
No.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.022
He's <i>our</i> son, Rachel.

06:50.024 --> 06:51.523
It's too late!

06:53.526 --> 06:54.827
What do you mean?

06:55.862 --> 06:57.095
No...

06:58.298 --> 07:00.866
No, no, you didn't...

07:00.868 --> 07:02.334
Tell me you didn't.

07:04.838 --> 07:06.170
It's already done.

07:08.207 --> 07:09.507
I'm sorry.

07:11.644 --> 07:12.944
Bye, Logan.

07:12.946 --> 07:16.715
(Music)

07:27.326 --> 07:29.493
Easy. It's okay.

07:29.495 --> 07:30.794
You're in good hands.

07:30.796 --> 07:32.830
- Clara.
- Hm.

07:32.832 --> 07:34.966
What are you doing here?

07:34.968 --> 07:36.834
Aleister asked me to watch over you.

07:36.836 --> 07:39.536
Saving you from the Coven
took a lot out of him.

07:42.073 --> 07:43.907
Why do you have my talisman?

07:43.909 --> 07:47.210
To protect you.
They can track you with this.

07:47.212 --> 07:49.747
I'm sure you know what
happened to your Aunt Clara.

07:49.749 --> 07:51.482
They took away my powers

07:51.484 --> 07:54.117
by destroying my talisman.

07:55.519 --> 07:57.520
We won't let that happen to you.

07:57.522 --> 07:59.756
Why would they do that?
They just made it for me.

07:59.758 --> 08:02.759
Because they want to control you.

08:02.761 --> 08:06.263
You're young and you're beautiful,

08:06.265 --> 08:08.398
and with this,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.633
you'll be more powerful
than any of them ever were.

08:10.635 --> 08:13.403
No more rules, no one to answer to.

08:13.405 --> 08:15.405
The world will be yours.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.773
Get your rest.

08:16.775 --> 08:20.910
Tomorrow you start your new life.

08:20.912 --> 08:24.412
(Music)

08:28.085 --> 08:31.787
(Shaky exhalation)

08:31.789 --> 08:34.957
(Sigh) She is asking too many questions.

08:34.958 --> 08:37.259
You need to give her one more
session to keep her in line.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.828
She has to be locked down. She will be.

08:39.830 --> 08:41.496
Soon enough it won't matter.

08:41.498 --> 08:43.565
The witches will be dead.

08:43.567 --> 08:46.668
It's the werewolves that concern me.

08:46.670 --> 08:48.169
They're hunters.

08:50.172 --> 08:51.973
What are you going to do with him?

08:53.042 --> 08:55.310
(Rapid breaths)

08:55.312 --> 08:58.914
He's going to make sure
they don't find us.

08:58.916 --> 09:01.115
(Muffled whimpering)

09:01.117 --> 09:03.184
(Speaking unknown language)

09:03.186 --> 09:06.354
(Screaming)

09:12.428 --> 09:13.828
(Whimpering)

09:13.830 --> 09:16.097
You can't just walk in
and take my phone!

09:16.099 --> 09:17.832
Give it back, you stupid bitch.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.934
Like it or not, I got
business I'm doing in there.

09:19.936 --> 09:22.235
Like it or not, you'll let her go.

09:22.237 --> 09:24.638
Ah, yeah?

09:24.640 --> 09:27.107
Who the hell are you?

09:27.109 --> 09:28.241
Who are <i>you?</i>

09:28.243 --> 09:29.643
A guy doing business in a sports bar,

09:29.645 --> 09:31.912
day-drinking in his best shirt?

09:31.914 --> 09:34.214
You don't deserve her. Let her go.

09:34.216 --> 09:35.849
(Whimper)

09:39.988 --> 09:41.421
Bystanders: Oh-h-h!

09:41.423 --> 09:43.991
(Grunting)

09:43.993 --> 09:47.493
(Music)

09:50.165 --> 09:51.397
Hey.

09:57.037 --> 09:58.404
Try that again.

09:58.406 --> 10:00.046
Bystanders:
All right, all right, come on!

10:01.441 --> 10:04.043
(Groaning)
(Mixed chuckles)

10:06.647 --> 10:08.280
(Gasping)

10:09.816 --> 10:11.384
Get out while you can.

10:13.320 --> 10:15.488
Man: You sure can take a punch.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.289
You're even better at throwing them.

10:17.291 --> 10:19.191
Hey, listen, I don't want any
more trouble, all right?

10:19.193 --> 10:20.359
Hey, no trouble.

10:20.361 --> 10:22.995
One shot! That is... impressive.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.698
A guy like you,
granite jaw, killer hook,

10:26.700 --> 10:29.334
I know a way you could make
a thousand bucks tonight.

10:29.336 --> 10:31.570
No thanks. I don't need the money.

10:31.572 --> 10:32.905
No...

10:32.907 --> 10:35.941
But you do need to scratch an itch.

10:35.943 --> 10:37.609
Yeah, I've seen it before.

10:37.611 --> 10:39.177
A guy does someone wrong,

10:39.179 --> 10:42.080
now he needs that sweet
release of a good punch.

10:42.082 --> 10:45.183
Throwing the punch or taking it.

10:45.185 --> 10:47.752
I know a place. No gloves, no rules.

10:47.754 --> 10:50.922
Just two guys working out their demons.

10:53.192 --> 10:54.892
Like a fight club, or something?

10:54.894 --> 10:56.094
Yeah.

10:56.096 --> 10:57.494
Something like that.

10:57.496 --> 10:59.931
Can those guys hit better
than that guy at the bar?

10:59.933 --> 11:01.131
Yeah.

11:01.133 --> 11:02.900
They're a bunch of monsters.

11:05.103 --> 11:06.904
(Crickets chirping)

11:06.906 --> 11:08.940
Jeremy: Is it worse?

11:08.942 --> 11:11.141
I can feel it progressing.

11:11.143 --> 11:12.677
It's wearing me down.

11:12.679 --> 11:14.111
I don't know how to fight someone

11:14.113 --> 11:15.979
who can attack from so far away.

11:15.981 --> 11:17.514
It's the Left Hand Path.

11:17.516 --> 11:19.149
Clara must have taught it to him.

11:19.151 --> 11:21.985
She was an expert at it
before we shunned her.

11:21.987 --> 11:24.921
She could execute a man
from her living room.

11:24.923 --> 11:27.824
Then strike back.

11:27.826 --> 11:30.293
Use that type of magic against Aleister.

11:30.295 --> 11:31.561
It's very difficult.

11:31.563 --> 11:34.163
I would need a strand
of hair from a comb,

11:34.165 --> 11:36.600
saliva, something with his essence...

11:38.402 --> 11:39.970
What?

11:39.972 --> 11:42.739
There is something we can try.

11:42.741 --> 11:44.440
I'll need an egg.

11:44.442 --> 11:47.942
(Music)

11:49.347 --> 11:50.879
The shroud was right here.

11:55.952 --> 11:58.321
<i>Essentia crescat.</i>

12:01.024 --> 12:02.725
One skin cell, one strand of hair,

12:02.727 --> 12:05.327
that's all I need
to grow a piece of Aleister.

12:05.329 --> 12:06.629
(Cracking)

12:12.468 --> 12:15.004
There is no getting used to this.

12:15.006 --> 12:17.572
What will this spell accomplish?

12:17.574 --> 12:19.307
It will kill Aleister.

12:19.309 --> 12:22.210
I just hope it does so in time.

12:25.648 --> 12:26.881
(Gasping)

12:26.883 --> 12:28.250
(Screaming)

12:28.252 --> 12:30.752
(Whimpering)
What is it?

12:30.754 --> 12:32.587
I don't know.

12:32.589 --> 12:34.156
It's just my head.

12:34.158 --> 12:35.557
It feels like an ice pick

12:35.559 --> 12:37.692
is piercing through my skull.

12:37.694 --> 12:39.326
Is it the Undoing?

12:39.328 --> 12:41.729
No, this is Ruth.

12:41.731 --> 12:43.998
She's using dark magic.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.933
She is desperate.

12:45.935 --> 12:48.102
Ruth is attacking me?

12:48.104 --> 12:50.672
She's slapping you
with your own left hand.

12:53.441 --> 12:54.941
We will see about that.

12:57.412 --> 12:59.547
This is just the beginning.

12:59.549 --> 13:01.382
It will help me to...

13:01.384 --> 13:03.484
(Indistinct murmuring)

13:03.486 --> 13:05.419
Savannah is trying to contact me.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.158
I am...

13:11.160 --> 13:13.526
...with you.

13:13.528 --> 13:15.595
Ruth, is that you?

13:15.597 --> 13:16.930
Savannah: Clara...

13:16.932 --> 13:18.699
I knew it was you behind all this.

13:18.701 --> 13:20.567
Who else would be so spiteful?

13:20.569 --> 13:23.369
I'm not the one using
Left Hand magic now, Ruth.

13:25.106 --> 13:27.106
You're doing this to me.

13:27.108 --> 13:30.276
You're trying to kill
your own son, again.

13:30.278 --> 13:32.579
<i>And you will fail, again.</i>

13:32.581 --> 13:34.614
Listen to me, Aleister.

13:34.616 --> 13:36.949
I was a 17-year-old girl.

13:36.951 --> 13:38.451
I didn't have a choice.

13:38.453 --> 13:39.686
It was the Prophesy.

13:39.688 --> 13:41.654
Say it, Mother!

13:41.656 --> 13:45.758
You ordered the execution
of an innocent child.

13:45.760 --> 13:47.292
Yes.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.761
You were a problem
and I needed you dead.

13:48.763 --> 13:50.429
It was me. It was my choice.

13:50.431 --> 13:53.332
But if you care about innocent
people, then let them live.

13:53.334 --> 13:55.634
No. None of you are innocent.

13:56.737 --> 13:59.338
You vile woman.

13:59.340 --> 14:01.707
May you all rot in hell.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.074
(Small whimper)

14:03.076 --> 14:06.576
(Music)

14:08.148 --> 14:09.848
I will find you.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.418
Who is that?

14:13.420 --> 14:14.819
This is Jeremy.

14:16.588 --> 14:17.956
Jeremy.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.992
<i>How is Clay since you stabbed him?</i>

14:20.994 --> 14:22.360
<i>Has he forgiven you?</i>

14:22.362 --> 14:24.595
No matter what happens,

14:24.597 --> 14:27.331
no matter where you try to hide,
I will track you down.

14:27.333 --> 14:31.102
Savannah:
I will find you and you will die

14:31.104 --> 14:33.003
watching your limbs being...

14:33.005 --> 14:34.672
...ripped from your body.

14:34.674 --> 14:38.174
(Music)

14:43.982 --> 14:46.484
I will be ready for you.

14:47.519 --> 14:50.020
(Grunt)
(Gasp)

14:50.022 --> 14:52.555
(Shaky breaths)

14:55.459 --> 14:58.195
There are windowless brick walls.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.197
There's a set of stairs
leading to a floor above.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.132
They're underground.

15:02.134 --> 15:04.567
(Grunting in pain)
What's wrong?

15:04.569 --> 15:06.235
I think tapping into your communication

15:06.237 --> 15:08.905
has done something... (Groaning)
(Cracking)

15:08.907 --> 15:11.441
The Change...

15:11.443 --> 15:13.976
I'm... losing control.

15:13.978 --> 15:15.478
You have to call the others.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.914
Tell them to look for a basement.

15:17.916 --> 15:21.483
(Groaning, yelling)

15:24.528 --> 15:26.215
Nick: Doesn't look like anybody's here.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.949
Elena: Or they want us to think that.

15:35.169 --> 15:36.637
Anything?

15:36.639 --> 15:38.204
The house should have a basement,

15:38.206 --> 15:40.306
let's find a way down.

15:40.308 --> 15:44.054
(Music)

15:55.056 --> 15:56.822
This is interesting.

15:56.824 --> 15:58.324
Really?

16:03.029 --> 16:05.564
(Click, thud)

16:09.435 --> 16:11.237
Go get Clay and Elena.

16:11.239 --> 16:14.251
(Music)

16:35.566 --> 16:37.600
Nothing?

16:37.931 --> 16:39.563
Nick: You're bleeding.

16:43.231 --> 16:46.167
We need to move fast.

16:46.169 --> 16:49.170
That smell...

16:49.172 --> 16:50.938
It's death.

16:57.011 --> 16:59.547
(Eerie music)

17:04.886 --> 17:06.920
She's mummified.

17:06.922 --> 17:08.789
What did Clara do to her?

17:08.790 --> 17:11.825
Paige: It wasn't Clara.

17:11.827 --> 17:13.594
Aleister.

17:13.596 --> 17:16.563
Nick: Whatever it was...

17:16.565 --> 17:18.298
I think they filmed it.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.267
(Music)

17:21.269 --> 17:23.435
This guy you're up against...

17:23.438 --> 17:25.438
He's built like a truck.

17:25.440 --> 17:28.007
You sure you're up for this?

17:28.009 --> 17:29.709
I'm good.

17:29.711 --> 17:32.345
(Mixed shouting from other room)

17:32.347 --> 17:35.847
(Music)

17:37.085 --> 17:39.184
(Sniffing)

17:39.186 --> 17:42.655
Well, looky here!

17:42.657 --> 17:45.791
Zachary Cain.

17:45.793 --> 17:48.160
- Thought you were dead.
- Clay spared my life,

17:48.162 --> 17:51.130
though he did take a little
something of mine in exchange.

17:51.132 --> 17:52.931
Now you're going to pay for that.

17:52.933 --> 17:54.500
(Percussive music)

17:54.502 --> 17:56.468
(Thud)
(Grunt)

17:56.470 --> 17:58.337
(Mixed shouting)

17:58.339 --> 18:00.872
(Mixed grunts)

18:10.650 --> 18:13.118
I've been tickled harder than that.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.219
(Growling)

18:15.221 --> 18:16.487
Oof!

18:16.489 --> 18:19.290
Did that tickle?

18:19.292 --> 18:21.760
Zachary: (Yelling)

18:21.762 --> 18:24.262
(Grunts)

18:25.697 --> 18:28.266
(Excited shouting)

18:33.172 --> 18:34.838
(Rapid heartbeat)

18:34.840 --> 18:36.674
Something's wrong.

18:36.676 --> 18:39.377
- Don't you throw this fight!
- It's the Change.

18:39.379 --> 18:41.145
You've got to get me out of here, kid.

18:41.147 --> 18:43.814
(Grunts)

18:43.816 --> 18:45.282
You better stop it.

18:45.284 --> 18:46.850
I can't.

18:46.852 --> 18:48.618
Knock me out!

18:48.620 --> 18:52.120
(Music)

18:56.062 --> 18:58.662
Oh my gosh, kid, just choke me out.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.467
(Growling)

19:09.039 --> 19:11.575
(Choking)

19:17.881 --> 19:20.717
(Crickets chirping)

19:20.719 --> 19:23.753
That took all of my
willpower to change back.

19:23.755 --> 19:25.755
That's never happened to me before.

19:25.757 --> 19:28.424
- You're losing control.
- Yes.

19:28.426 --> 19:30.126
And earlier, Clay's eyesight was off

19:30.128 --> 19:32.294
and the wound on his head wouldn't heal.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.597
I thought that was a side
effect of the possession.

19:34.599 --> 19:36.732
It's the Undoing.

19:36.734 --> 19:38.567
It's affecting you, too.

19:38.569 --> 19:41.270
If your abilities as a
werewolf are becoming erratic,

19:41.272 --> 19:45.541
uncontrollable, it must mean
that as we are dying...

19:45.543 --> 19:48.143
The werewolf curse is lifting.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.711
Yes.

19:49.713 --> 19:52.413
When we are gone,

19:52.415 --> 19:54.382
the curse will be no more.

19:54.384 --> 19:56.785
Won't be able to Change. Or Change back.

19:56.787 --> 19:58.220
There will be humans,

19:58.222 --> 20:00.789
and there will be wolves,

20:00.791 --> 20:02.323
and that will be that.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.861
So if I am a wolf at dawn...

20:06.863 --> 20:08.829
You will be for the rest of your life.

20:10.666 --> 20:14.269
We have to warn the rest of the Pack.

20:14.271 --> 20:18.105
Woman: (Choking)

20:18.107 --> 20:19.641
(Choking stops)

20:22.277 --> 20:24.845
(Gasp, deep breath)

20:27.149 --> 20:28.816
<i>It worked!</i>

20:28.818 --> 20:30.818
Aleister: <i>Is she gone?</i>

20:30.820 --> 20:34.054
Clara: <i>I felt her
consciousness disappear.</i>

20:34.056 --> 20:36.056
<i>It's amazing.</i>

20:36.058 --> 20:38.224
It's the same thing he did to me.

20:38.226 --> 20:41.094
Aleister: <i>Do you want to keep her, Clara?
We have time.</i>

20:41.096 --> 20:44.164
Clara: <i>No. She's not what I need.</i>

20:44.166 --> 20:46.065
<i>We know it worked.</i>

20:46.067 --> 20:50.404
<i>Put me back in my body.</i>

20:50.406 --> 20:52.406
Aleister: <i>Enter the circle, Clara.</i>

20:52.408 --> 20:55.884
(Music)

21:04.886 --> 21:07.420
(Choking)

21:07.422 --> 21:10.922
(Music)

21:15.363 --> 21:17.296
(Choking stops)

21:17.298 --> 21:19.865
(Gasping, panting)

21:24.738 --> 21:27.672
<i>When all the witches are dead,</i>

21:27.674 --> 21:29.541
<i>it will just be you and me.</i>

21:29.543 --> 21:31.276
What are they planning?

21:31.278 --> 21:33.411
Clara wants to possess a new body.

21:35.949 --> 21:37.749
Who survives the Undoing?

21:39.052 --> 21:41.686
Clara will. She's no longer a witch.

21:41.688 --> 21:44.188
Aleister's protected
since he's casting the spell,

21:44.190 --> 21:46.324
and Savannah because she's the conduit.

21:46.326 --> 21:50.662
But she said it would
just be the two of them.

21:50.664 --> 21:52.964
She wants to possess Savannah's body.

21:52.966 --> 21:56.167
And take over Savannah's powers.

21:56.169 --> 21:58.770
(Siren wailing in distance)

22:05.810 --> 22:07.578
Logan: Cain?

22:10.815 --> 22:13.484
- What the hell you think you're doing
here? - Take it easy.

22:13.486 --> 22:15.552
I'm just here to warn you.
Back at the fight,

22:15.554 --> 22:17.320
that Change, it wasn't random.

22:17.322 --> 22:19.155
Just got off the phone with Nick.

22:19.157 --> 22:21.224
He's saying the same thing is
happening to werewolves everywhere.

22:21.226 --> 22:23.226
Come tomorrow, we won't
be able to change anymore.

22:23.228 --> 22:25.161
What are you talking about?
That's not possible.

22:25.163 --> 22:27.531
Well, it's happening. See, I'm
still bleeding from the fight.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.099
Now, that's not normal.

22:29.101 --> 22:31.001
- Come on.
- I'm just here to warn you.

22:31.003 --> 22:32.770
But, if you Change, that's it.

22:32.772 --> 22:35.872
You'll be dining on raccoons and
garbage until the day you die.

22:38.276 --> 22:39.842
How can we stop it?

22:39.844 --> 22:41.912
You want to fight the thing
that's causing this,

22:41.914 --> 22:43.646
you've got to fold in with the Pack.

22:43.648 --> 22:45.415
Huh, the Pack... Pfft.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.384
That's your call, brother.

22:47.386 --> 22:50.319
(Electronic beeping)

22:50.321 --> 22:52.054
What the hell is going on in there?

22:54.925 --> 22:57.727
It's not what.

22:57.729 --> 22:59.462
It's who.

23:05.168 --> 23:07.803
(Clicks, air hissing)
(Sigh)

23:10.172 --> 23:11.740
Who is it?

23:13.108 --> 23:14.910
It's my girl, Amber.

23:14.912 --> 23:17.312
She wanted to be a wolf so bad.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.681
I think that psycho LeBlanc bit her.

23:19.683 --> 23:21.550
I told her it wouldn't work.

23:25.788 --> 23:29.457
You need to put her out of her misery.

23:29.459 --> 23:31.525
Misery? No...

23:31.527 --> 23:33.928
She's brain-dead.
She can't feel a thing.

23:35.297 --> 23:37.065
The hell is all mine now.

23:38.367 --> 23:40.401
I just can't let her go.

23:42.904 --> 23:45.506
I can't.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.375
(Cellphone ringing)

23:48.377 --> 23:50.377
Rachel?

23:50.379 --> 23:53.213
Rachel: (On phone) <i>Logan, there's something
wrong with the baby!</i>

23:54.883 --> 23:56.484
You're still pregnant?

23:56.486 --> 23:59.219
<i>I was afraid of what</i>
<i>you are, so I lied to you.</i>

23:59.221 --> 24:01.021
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

24:01.023 --> 24:03.190
<i>Logan, I need your help.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

24:03.192 --> 24:05.425
Okay, okay, just...

24:05.427 --> 24:07.260
Where are you? I'm coming.

24:11.265 --> 24:13.867
(High-pitched squeal)

24:16.303 --> 24:18.371
We're wasting our time.

24:18.373 --> 24:21.173
We're not going to find anything
here that'll lead us to Aleister.

24:21.175 --> 24:24.644
Have you felt anything yet?

24:24.646 --> 24:26.178
Some sounds are distorted,

24:26.180 --> 24:28.414
but I haven't felt the need to Change.

24:29.950 --> 24:31.618
You think it's true?

24:31.620 --> 24:32.985
That the curse is lifting?

24:32.987 --> 24:34.953
That we won't be werewolves anymore?

24:34.955 --> 24:37.123
Jeremy wouldn't say it
if he didn't believe it.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.658
Look, I know what it means for us

24:39.660 --> 24:41.460
not be a wolves anymore,

24:41.462 --> 24:43.162
but if it happens,

24:43.164 --> 24:45.564
our lives become easier.

24:45.566 --> 24:47.066
They will.

24:48.902 --> 24:52.337
I love you for being
the one to say that,

24:52.339 --> 24:55.874
but the wolf is what saved you.

24:55.876 --> 24:58.043
Everything that we've been fighting for,

24:58.045 --> 25:00.779
against Malcolm, against the Mutts,

25:00.781 --> 25:04.182
who we are,

25:04.184 --> 25:06.451
- I mean, it'll all be gone.
- No.

25:06.453 --> 25:09.020
Not until dawn.

25:09.022 --> 25:12.223
Until then, we keep fighting.

25:12.225 --> 25:16.061
For the witches, for the pack,

25:16.063 --> 25:18.029
for each other.

25:21.100 --> 25:24.569
(Clattering)

25:24.571 --> 25:27.237
There's nothing here. Let's go.

25:27.239 --> 25:29.373
No, we can't just leave.

25:29.375 --> 25:32.376
We've got to find some...
(Distorted rumbling)

25:35.513 --> 25:37.314
What is it?

25:37.316 --> 25:39.683
It's my... my eyes.

25:39.685 --> 25:42.652
(Shivering) It's so cold.

25:45.323 --> 25:46.890
Oh...

25:46.892 --> 25:49.726
Both: (Panting)

25:49.728 --> 25:51.995
(Rumbling, banging)

25:53.598 --> 25:55.031
What was that?

25:55.033 --> 25:58.812
(Music)

26:10.748 --> 26:13.349
Oh, this can't be happening.

26:15.767 --> 26:17.568
Nick! Paige! Can you hear me?

26:17.570 --> 26:19.036
Yeah, we hear you!

26:19.038 --> 26:22.706
Hold tight. We're going
to find a way in.

26:22.708 --> 26:25.709
What the...

26:25.711 --> 26:27.878
Ah, Jesus.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.680
What the hell's going on?

26:29.682 --> 26:31.581
It's a Witches' Door.

26:31.583 --> 26:35.218
It's used for hiding spaces.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.521
Well... how do we open it?

26:38.523 --> 26:41.458
There's usually a trigger.

26:41.460 --> 26:43.961
Something's out of place.

26:43.963 --> 26:45.795
Everything on that table.

26:45.797 --> 26:47.430
Go.

26:50.868 --> 26:53.803
(Panting)

26:53.805 --> 26:55.438
Uh...

26:57.475 --> 26:59.509
I don't think that I can do much more.

26:59.511 --> 27:01.478
Clay and Elena will
come save us, all right?

27:01.480 --> 27:03.346
It's going to be fine.

27:06.183 --> 27:07.716
Nick?

27:07.718 --> 27:09.852
We'll get out of here. I promise.

27:11.754 --> 27:13.389
Paige!

27:13.391 --> 27:16.930
(Music)

27:21.932 --> 27:24.032
<i>Signum mortis.</i>

27:24.034 --> 27:26.334
(Electricity buzzing)

27:26.336 --> 27:30.138
(Mixed whispers)

27:31.774 --> 27:34.610
(Distorted audio)

27:34.612 --> 27:37.612
(Chair clattering)

27:37.614 --> 27:38.946
(Gasp)

27:38.948 --> 27:40.382
Ruth, you okay?

27:40.384 --> 27:42.317
Oh, the magic is too much.

27:42.319 --> 27:44.819
Here...

27:44.821 --> 27:46.521
Sit down.

27:52.428 --> 27:55.029
You have to try again.

27:55.031 --> 27:57.264
I need to be where
I can harness the power

27:57.266 --> 28:00.868
of the coven leaders who came before me.

28:00.870 --> 28:03.571
The catacombs.

28:03.573 --> 28:06.774
Our coven has used it
since the 17th century.

28:06.776 --> 28:10.044
- It's our sanctuary.
- Where is it?

28:10.046 --> 28:11.512
It's in Boston.

28:11.514 --> 28:13.713
The Delphi building was
constructed on top of it.

28:13.715 --> 28:15.582
We still have time.
I can get you there fast.

28:15.584 --> 28:17.384
No, I can't ask you to take me.

28:19.421 --> 28:21.522
If I can't defeat him,

28:21.524 --> 28:23.390
you should be with your Pack.

28:23.392 --> 28:25.259
They'll need your guidance.

28:25.261 --> 28:27.027
I've caused enough pain.

28:28.996 --> 28:31.330
(Car door closing)

28:31.332 --> 28:33.232
There's someone here.

28:39.440 --> 28:42.241
Rachel: (Moaning)

28:42.243 --> 28:44.310
Jeremy, there's something
wrong with the baby.

28:44.312 --> 28:46.379
Let's get her to the couch.

28:46.381 --> 28:48.381
It's getting worse.

28:48.383 --> 28:50.550
As is the curse is lifting, it's
affecting all the werewolves.

28:50.552 --> 28:52.485
It must be having an impact on the baby.

28:52.487 --> 28:54.987
It hurts so much!
(Groaning)

28:54.989 --> 28:56.922
Okay, Rachel,

28:56.924 --> 28:59.357
pain is unavoidable,

28:59.359 --> 29:01.093
the suffering is optional.

29:01.095 --> 29:03.261
Fighting the pain is just
going to make it worse.

29:03.263 --> 29:05.230
- You have to breathe, okay?
(Panting) - Okay.

29:05.232 --> 29:08.266
Just get through the night, baby.
Just get through the night.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.502
Our curse is being lifted, sweetheart.

29:13.673 --> 29:16.274
I won't have to Change
into a wolf anymore.

29:16.276 --> 29:19.777
Our baby can be a normal baby and we...

29:19.779 --> 29:21.646
we'll be a normal family.

29:24.217 --> 29:26.351
You've made your choice, then, Logan.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.255
Jeremy...

29:33.492 --> 29:35.827
There's nothing more
that needs to be said.

29:35.829 --> 29:38.462
Take Rachel upstairs to
rest through the night.

29:41.066 --> 29:43.635
(Wincing, moaning)

29:45.104 --> 29:48.405
(Engine ignition)

29:48.407 --> 29:50.107
Ruth?

29:50.109 --> 29:52.009
(Vehicle departing)

29:53.345 --> 29:55.045
Ruth?

29:56.615 --> 29:58.115
Any luck?

29:58.117 --> 29:59.617
No.

29:59.619 --> 30:01.918
New plan.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.054
Watch out.

30:04.056 --> 30:06.556
(Grunting)

30:08.059 --> 30:10.160
Nick: Paige? Paige?

30:10.162 --> 30:11.762
Hey.

30:11.764 --> 30:13.396
How are you doing?

30:16.768 --> 30:18.201
Bloodroot.

30:18.203 --> 30:20.336
It's the only thing that will help me.

30:20.338 --> 30:23.640
Bloodroot? Okay. I don't know
what that is, but we'll get some.

30:23.642 --> 30:26.309
- We'll get some for you as soon as we get
out of here. - There's not much time.

30:26.311 --> 30:28.210
No, just... hang in there.

30:28.212 --> 30:31.513
Hang in there, babe. Hey...

30:31.515 --> 30:34.149
remember yesterday,

30:34.151 --> 30:37.653
when I said that I
wasn't falling for you?

30:37.655 --> 30:39.621
Well, I lied.

30:39.623 --> 30:41.890
No, don't.

30:41.892 --> 30:43.992
- No, no, no...
- Please don't.

30:43.994 --> 30:46.161
This is important, okay?

30:48.430 --> 30:50.865
You see through me.

30:50.867 --> 30:54.102
You... see beyond the jokes

30:54.104 --> 30:56.938
and the bravado and the...

30:56.940 --> 30:59.040
The hair.

30:59.042 --> 31:01.409
Yeah.
(Soft chuckles)

31:01.411 --> 31:02.776
And the hair.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.717
I never thought that
I could have what...

31:09.719 --> 31:12.587
Clay and Elena have, what...

31:12.589 --> 31:16.657
my father had with Lily...

31:16.659 --> 31:19.960
- this... feeling.
- Shh.

31:23.531 --> 31:26.399
I know what you are doing.

31:26.401 --> 31:28.035
It's okay.

31:28.037 --> 31:29.970
You don't need to console me.

31:29.972 --> 31:32.305
No, no, no... that's not what I'm doing.

31:34.575 --> 31:38.911
I'm telling you that I need you.

31:38.913 --> 31:42.582
I'm telling you

31:42.584 --> 31:45.184
that I love you, Paige.

31:45.186 --> 31:47.920
That I'm not going to let you die.

31:47.922 --> 31:49.422
Okay?

31:49.424 --> 31:52.924
(Music)

31:56.697 --> 31:59.232
(Sobs, sniffles)

32:01.135 --> 32:04.170
Thank you.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.339
I wish that we had more time together.

32:07.341 --> 32:10.841
(Music)

32:14.415 --> 32:17.516
How the hell did we
get here, kiddo? Huh?

32:20.186 --> 32:22.020
(Sigh)

32:22.022 --> 32:23.521
I'll tell you...

32:25.624 --> 32:27.859
(Sigh) we both love the wolf, babe.

32:31.297 --> 32:34.232
But the wolf's in trouble,

32:34.234 --> 32:37.302
and this is the only way to
help what we both love survive.

32:39.538 --> 32:41.572
So this is for us.

32:41.574 --> 32:44.141
(Air hissing, clicking)

32:53.419 --> 32:55.986
(Air hissing stops)

32:59.657 --> 33:02.193
(Shaky breaths)

33:04.996 --> 33:07.531
(Sobbing)

33:10.401 --> 33:12.436
Nick: Paige is really sick!

33:12.438 --> 33:14.438
You have to get us out of here!

33:14.440 --> 33:16.573
(Grunt) - Damn it!
- Hey, hey...

33:19.377 --> 33:21.812
You're bleeding.

33:21.814 --> 33:23.747
(Door opening, closing)

33:25.282 --> 33:27.217
Someone's here.

33:29.519 --> 33:31.187
Paige...

33:31.189 --> 33:34.232
(Music)

33:42.234 --> 33:44.000
Something out of place...

33:44.002 --> 33:47.014
(Music)

33:59.016 --> 34:02.822
(Music)

34:07.824 --> 34:09.724
I'm here for the cursed ones.

34:13.172 --> 34:16.982
(Music)

34:25.250 --> 34:27.850
You're all going to die.

34:27.851 --> 34:29.585
No one else is here.

34:29.588 --> 34:33.088
(Music)

34:34.326 --> 34:37.659
(Grunts)

34:37.661 --> 34:40.429
(Cracking)

34:40.431 --> 34:42.466
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.268
(Rumbling)

34:46.270 --> 34:48.071
(Bang)

34:54.043 --> 34:56.112
I don't know who the hell that is,

34:56.114 --> 34:58.648
but I'm hoping this bitch's house
has a supply of bloodroot.

35:00.883 --> 35:04.686
(Percussive music)

35:04.688 --> 35:07.761
(Music)

35:12.763 --> 35:15.297
(Coughing)

35:15.299 --> 35:18.442
(Music)

35:27.444 --> 35:29.978
(Coughing)

35:31.681 --> 35:34.282
(Clicking, hinge creaking)

35:38.487 --> 35:40.488
(Wood cracking)

35:40.490 --> 35:41.856
(Thud)

35:46.061 --> 35:49.675
(Music)

36:03.078 --> 36:04.845
Aleister: Jeremy.

36:04.847 --> 36:07.481
You wanted to find me. Well, here I am.

36:07.483 --> 36:10.750
Where is my mother? I can
feel she's not in the house.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.686
<i>Desiste.</i>

36:12.688 --> 36:15.755
I see your rage. And raise you mine.

36:17.292 --> 36:21.328
You will die, but how much
pain you feel is up to you.

36:21.330 --> 36:23.396
I want Ruth.

36:23.398 --> 36:25.165
Tell me where she is.

36:25.167 --> 36:26.465
(Wincing)

36:26.467 --> 36:28.702
I suppose if you kill me,

36:28.704 --> 36:30.336
you'll never find her.

36:30.338 --> 36:31.971
(Growling)

36:31.973 --> 36:34.640
Jeremy: (Groaning in pain)

36:34.642 --> 36:36.609
(Wolf snarling)

36:39.979 --> 36:41.514
Oh...

36:41.516 --> 36:44.116
(Panting)
(Wolf snarling)

36:46.820 --> 36:49.355
(Snarling)

36:49.357 --> 36:52.733
(Music)

37:00.735 --> 37:02.367
(Whimpering)

37:06.206 --> 37:08.774
(Whine)
(Panting)

37:16.849 --> 37:19.384
(Mixed groaning)

37:27.593 --> 37:30.261
Ruth: (Speaking unknown language)

37:31.063 --> 37:33.597
(Shrieking)

37:35.332 --> 37:37.167
(Groaning in pain)

37:37.169 --> 37:40.470
That black spot on your
face is getting bigger.

37:40.472 --> 37:41.772
Ahh!

37:41.774 --> 37:44.340
Your mother is killing you, Aleister.

37:55.319 --> 37:57.920
(Wolf panting, whimpering)

37:57.922 --> 38:01.195
(Music)

38:06.197 --> 38:07.897
Logan?

38:07.899 --> 38:10.432
- Logan!
- Hey, wait, wait.

38:10.434 --> 38:12.134
You have to let him change.

38:12.136 --> 38:14.670
He's in pain, Jeremy!
You have to do something!

38:16.739 --> 38:18.507
Jeremy: Aleister is here.

38:18.509 --> 38:20.142
He was going to kill us all.

38:20.144 --> 38:23.212
Logan changed to save us.

38:23.214 --> 38:25.013
Save him.

38:25.015 --> 38:28.515
(Music)

38:32.323 --> 38:34.956
(Rapid breaths)
Oh...

38:38.561 --> 38:39.994
No.

38:45.767 --> 38:47.001
No.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.806
They're too deep.

38:51.808 --> 38:54.475
I can't do anything about that.

38:54.477 --> 38:58.183
(Music)

39:03.185 --> 39:04.885
- Logan.
- I'm so sorry.

39:04.887 --> 39:06.754
- Logan!
- I'm sorry Rachel.

39:08.357 --> 39:10.257
I never meant to bring you into this.

39:12.293 --> 39:14.928
And I never wanted you
to see me that way.

39:14.930 --> 39:16.830
The wolf.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.766
You did that for Jeremy and me.

39:19.768 --> 39:22.669
What I saw was beautiful.

39:22.671 --> 39:24.571
And I love you for it.

39:24.573 --> 39:26.639
I'm sorry I lied about the baby.

39:26.641 --> 39:28.942
I'm sorry I pushed you away. I'm sorry.

39:28.944 --> 39:30.943
Listen to me. Listen to me.

39:32.380 --> 39:33.946
Our son...

39:33.948 --> 39:36.916
no matter what happens...

39:36.918 --> 39:40.052
don't you hide anything from him.

39:40.054 --> 39:42.856
You tell him... you tell him...

39:42.858 --> 39:44.891
tell him who I was.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.994
I was his dad.

39:47.996 --> 39:49.762
You're going to tell him.

39:49.764 --> 39:51.998
(Sobbing)

39:52.000 --> 39:54.500
We both know...

39:54.502 --> 39:58.237
I love you, Rachel...

39:58.239 --> 40:01.840
For you...

40:01.842 --> 40:03.276
For us.

40:03.278 --> 40:05.310
(Sobbing)

40:05.312 --> 40:07.813
(Grunting)

40:18.291 --> 40:19.925
I'm proud of you.

40:23.695 --> 40:26.264
(Rapid breaths)

40:27.633 --> 40:29.667
(Breathing stops)

40:32.271 --> 40:35.740
No... Logan, don't leave me!

40:35.742 --> 40:37.442
Logan!

40:37.444 --> 40:39.343
Logan!

40:46.339 --> 40:47.641
Elena?

40:47.655 --> 40:49.888
Elena: (On phone) <i>Jeremy,
there was a complication.</i>

40:49.915 --> 40:52.816
Is everyone all right?
<i>Yeah, we're on our way back.</i>

40:52.825 --> 40:55.592
<i>No. You have to go</i>
<i>to Boston to protect Ruth.</i>

40:56.239 --> 40:59.174
<i>Aleister was here,</i>
<i>he was looking for her.</i>

40:59.176 --> 41:00.975
He was there?

41:00.977 --> 41:03.478
<i>Paige will know where to take you.</i>

41:03.480 --> 41:06.847
<i>There is nothing for</i>
<i>you to do here, now.</i>

41:06.849 --> 41:09.917
Jeremy, what is going on?

41:09.919 --> 41:11.351
(Sigh)

41:13.221 --> 41:15.456
We have to get to Boston.

41:15.458 --> 41:17.091
<i>Wait for me.</i>

41:19.527 --> 41:23.405
(Music)

41:31.407 --> 41:33.207
(Coughing)

41:33.209 --> 41:37.020
(Music)

41:47.022 --> 41:49.555
(Retching)

41:52.392 --> 41:54.661
It's worse than before!

41:54.663 --> 41:56.896
More powerful.

41:56.898 --> 41:58.897
If the Undoing is killing Ruth,

41:58.899 --> 42:00.966
how is she killing me?

42:00.968 --> 42:03.436
There's only one way Ruth can
manifest the power she needs

42:03.438 --> 42:05.505
for this type of magic.

42:05.507 --> 42:08.007
- How?
- It's not how,

42:08.009 --> 42:10.343
where.

42:10.345 --> 42:12.645
I know where she's gone.

42:12.647 --> 42:14.346
(Grunt)

42:17.583 --> 42:18.851
How you feeling?

42:18.853 --> 42:21.720
Better. But it won't last long.

42:21.722 --> 42:24.657
Hey.

42:24.659 --> 42:27.893
I told you I would not let
you die, and you won't.

42:27.895 --> 42:30.629
Not while I'm here.

42:30.631 --> 42:32.697
- I believe you.
- Okay.

42:37.603 --> 42:39.137
Darling, you okay?

42:41.641 --> 42:43.675
Yeah. Just...

42:43.677 --> 42:45.143
my hearing is getting worse.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.944
This'll all be over soon.

42:46.946 --> 42:50.715
And no matter what happens,
we face it together.

42:50.717 --> 42:53.117
What if we're forced
to Change, like Jeremy?

42:53.119 --> 42:54.686
If you Change, I Change.

42:54.688 --> 42:57.421
I will live the rest of my
life either human or wolf,

42:57.423 --> 42:59.523
but I will not live it apart from you.

43:03.028 --> 43:04.861
We fight together

43:04.863 --> 43:06.564
and we stay together.

43:24.381 --> 43:26.416
Zachary Cain.

43:29.120 --> 43:31.321
Alive and well.

43:31.323 --> 43:33.890
I take it Clay didn't tell
you that he spared my life?

43:33.892 --> 43:35.926
Zachary, what are you doing here?

43:35.928 --> 43:37.427
Well, I came because I heard

43:37.429 --> 43:39.161
that we're facing the
end of the werewolves.

43:39.163 --> 43:40.796
We're fighting against magic.

43:40.798 --> 43:43.733
There are witches in the world,

43:43.735 --> 43:46.436
and they are the cause of this.

43:46.438 --> 43:50.139
Witches, zombies, dragons, whatever.

43:50.141 --> 43:53.042
Jeremy, you just point me in the
direction of what needs killing.

43:53.044 --> 43:56.057
(Music)

44:14.864 --> 44:16.598
Let's finish this.

44:16.600 --> 44:20.100
(Music)

44:23.105 --> 44:25.607
(Both gasp)
What... what do you even say?

44:25.609 --> 44:27.608
- I don't know.
- At this point.

44:27.610 --> 44:29.844
I just have so many emotions.
I just didn't see that

44:29.846 --> 44:31.945
- coming. I didn't expect that.
- Neither did I.

44:31.947 --> 44:34.681
- What an ending as well.
- Man, well, stay with us for

44:34.683 --> 44:36.683
Innerspace: After Bite, the
official aftershow for Bitten.

44:36.685 --> 44:39.753
What a fantastic episode and
joining us are Greg Bryk, Genelle

44:39.755 --> 44:42.455
Williams and the very much alive
Michael Xavier.

44:42.457 --> 44:44.858
That's because the character
died. He's just..

44:44.860 --> 44:48.028
Yeah, I know. Thanks for
being so practical. I'm just

44:48.030 --> 44:50.297
- emotional.
- Plus we'll have plenty of set

44:50.299 --> 44:52.499
secrets for you. We'll also meet
the guys responsible for all the

44:52.501 --> 44:54.601
amazing fight scenes and don't
