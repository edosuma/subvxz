00:53.498 --> 00:56.632
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor,</i>

00:56.634 --> 01:00.436
<i>known for his
extraordinary ability.</i>

01:00.438 --> 01:03.472
<i>He could talk to animals.</i>

01:04.944 --> 01:07.845
<i>Dr. Dolittle's reputation
spread far and wide.</i>

01:07.847 --> 01:10.680
<i>Even the queen of England called on him.</i>

01:10.682 --> 01:13.482
<i>So grateful for his help,</i>

01:13.484 --> 01:15.719
<i>she gifted him
a wondrous sanctuary,</i>

01:15.721 --> 01:19.656
<i>whose doors were open
to all creatures.</i>

01:19.658 --> 01:21.725
<i>His days belonged
to the animals,</i>

01:21.727 --> 01:26.029
<i>but his heart belonged
to one woman:</i>

01:26.031 --> 01:29.967
<i>Lily, the fearless explorer.</i>

01:29.969 --> 01:34.504
<i>They traveled the globe
going on great adventures,</i>

01:34.506 --> 01:38.477
<i>defending creatures who could
not defend themselves.</i>

01:43.749 --> 01:47.551
<i>They made
an extraordinary team.</i>

01:47.553 --> 01:50.589
<i>Soon, that team
became a family.</i>

01:52.758 --> 01:55.059
<i>With Lily by his side,</i>

01:55.061 --> 01:58.629
<i>Dolittle never felt more alive,</i>

01:58.631 --> 02:02.702
<i>until one day,
she left on an adventure.</i>

02:10.644 --> 02:13.546
<i>Lily died at sea.</i>

02:17.617 --> 02:20.818
<i>Heartbroken, he locked
the gates of the manor</i>

02:20.820 --> 02:23.955
<i>and completely retreated
from the world.</i>

02:23.957 --> 02:28.493
<i>As for me and the animals
whose lives he'd saved,</i>

02:28.495 --> 02:32.899
<i>we were left to wonder...
could anyone save his?</i>

02:36.703 --> 02:39.972
<i>Until one morning,
a most unlikely creature</i>

02:39.974 --> 02:42.707
<i>found its way
into Dolittle's life.</i>

02:42.709 --> 02:45.576
<i>A very special boy.</i>

02:45.578 --> 02:47.612
<i>In a time where people
thought of animals</i>

02:47.614 --> 02:50.950
<i>only as possessions,
food or sport,</i>

02:50.952 --> 02:53.819
<i>this boy felt
quite differently.</i>

03:02.663 --> 03:05.130
This way,
me scattered squirrel.

03:05.132 --> 03:07.300
Right.

03:07.302 --> 03:08.867
Junior flushes 'em.

03:08.869 --> 03:10.602
You shoot 'em. Yeah?

03:10.604 --> 03:11.804
Right. Good plan, Dad.

03:11.806 --> 03:13.105
Get ready.

03:13.107 --> 03:15.574
- Shoulder your gun.
- Do I have to, Uncle?

03:15.576 --> 03:17.009
Come on, boy.

03:17.011 --> 03:18.711
Duck!

03:18.713 --> 03:20.579
Duck! Duck, duck!

03:20.581 --> 03:22.881
- Duck! Duck!
- There, there they go.

03:22.883 --> 03:24.683
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
You got him. You got him.

03:24.685 --> 03:25.684
You got him.
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

03:25.686 --> 03:27.954
- Oh, oh, no, I can't.
- Shoot, shoot, shoot!

03:32.127 --> 03:33.827
You can't keep
missing on purpose.

03:33.829 --> 03:35.028
Oh, look.

03:35.030 --> 03:36.963
He hit something this time.

03:43.138 --> 03:45.171
Oh, no.

03:45.173 --> 03:47.040
We have to help him.

03:47.042 --> 03:48.908
Aye.

03:48.910 --> 03:50.610
We never leave
an animal suffering.

03:50.612 --> 03:51.911
Not on our error.

03:51.913 --> 03:53.015
Here you go.

04:00.789 --> 04:03.058
He's a very odd boy.

04:14.370 --> 04:15.804
Follow Poly.

04:31.654 --> 04:34.388
"Home of Dr. John
and Lily Dolittle.

04:34.390 --> 04:35.990
We treat all animals."

04:45.835 --> 04:47.168
Ah-ah.

04:47.170 --> 04:48.305
Follow Poly.

04:53.709 --> 04:55.709
Secret entrance.

05:37.288 --> 05:39.788
P-Poly? Where'd you go?

05:54.973 --> 05:57.006
Good... good... good dog.

05:57.008 --> 06:00.143
Big, hairy...

07:59.899 --> 08:01.233
It's not good.

08:01.235 --> 08:05.137
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm the only human here.

08:05.139 --> 08:06.605
Just ignore them.

08:06.607 --> 08:08.374
There's no getting past
a Kalahari snare, Doc.

08:08.376 --> 08:09.907
It's an ingenious design.

08:09.909 --> 08:11.909
I think you just
caught yourself a boy.

08:11.911 --> 08:13.279
Let me see.
Wait, I don't want to see.

08:13.281 --> 08:14.913
Just make it go away.

08:14.915 --> 08:17.049
Deep breaths, Doc.
Dab-Dab's got your back.

08:17.051 --> 08:18.317
Don't be afraid, John.

08:18.319 --> 08:19.918
It's just a boy.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.453
This is an opportunity.

08:21.455 --> 08:24.456
Oh, this is a nightmare!

08:26.093 --> 08:27.928
- Oh, come on.
- Pardon me.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.133
Whatever are you
doing up there?

08:33.334 --> 08:35.067
I've come from
Buckingham Palace

08:35.069 --> 08:36.869
on urgent business.

08:36.871 --> 08:40.205
Can you tell me if this is
the home of John Dolittle?

08:40.207 --> 08:42.309
Who are you?

08:42.311 --> 08:44.209
You may call me Lady Rose.

08:44.211 --> 08:46.212
And you are?

08:46.214 --> 08:48.047
Stubbins.

08:48.049 --> 08:51.284
Could you help me down?

08:51.286 --> 08:53.320
This goes against
Dolittle's rules.

08:53.322 --> 08:55.954
Why are humans
against the rules again?

08:55.956 --> 08:57.424
If you let humans too close,
you'll get hurt

08:57.426 --> 08:59.492
more than you would if
you didn't let them in at all.

08:59.494 --> 09:00.960
Isn't that right, Doc?

09:00.962 --> 09:02.128
That's enough, everybody.

09:02.130 --> 09:03.363
Back to our routine.

09:03.365 --> 09:05.098
- We have a very full day.
- John!

09:05.100 --> 09:07.033
Pull yourself together.

09:07.035 --> 09:09.235
You can't ignore people
just because they're...

09:09.237 --> 09:10.670
people.

09:10.672 --> 09:12.673
What if they need help?

09:14.276 --> 09:16.376
Possum. Play dead.

09:16.378 --> 09:18.978
This is ridiculous.

09:18.980 --> 09:20.313
Chee-Chee,
will you answer the door?

09:20.315 --> 09:22.148
You're the only one with arms.

09:22.150 --> 09:24.384
I think chess was
enough pressure for one day.

09:24.386 --> 09:25.486
Chee-Chee, boy,

09:25.488 --> 09:27.187
this is what we trained for.

09:27.189 --> 09:29.490
Be brave and get rid of 'em.

09:29.492 --> 09:31.392
And don't forget your mantra.

09:31.394 --> 09:34.528
I am not a prisoner of fear?

09:34.530 --> 09:37.264
You are not a prisoner of fear.

09:39.968 --> 09:41.435
Have you been here before?

09:41.437 --> 09:43.371
The queen's told me
all about it.

09:43.373 --> 09:45.706
It's a most unusual place.

09:45.708 --> 09:47.276
I'm prepared for anything.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.153
Wonderful.

09:59.155 --> 10:01.088
A gorilla answering the door.

10:01.090 --> 10:03.991
Just as the queen said.

10:09.298 --> 10:12.233
Oh, wait a minute.

10:12.235 --> 10:14.438
I have an injured squirrel.

10:21.311 --> 10:24.947
I should never have let you go.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.099
Hello?

11:04.288 --> 11:06.622
Oh, look at you.

11:06.624 --> 11:10.460
Aren't you peculiar
posing as a twig?

11:10.462 --> 11:12.361
Move, please.

11:12.363 --> 11:13.629
This is my hiding spot.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.369
Not here.

11:21.539 --> 11:24.106
Are you all right down there?

11:24.108 --> 11:25.541
Yeah. Fine.

11:25.543 --> 11:27.410
- Go on.
- Dr. Dolittle?

11:27.412 --> 11:30.046
- Yeah, right.
- You have been summoned

11:30.048 --> 11:33.115
to Buckingham Palace
by the queen herself.

11:33.117 --> 11:34.450
Hoo-ha.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.052
Go on.

11:36.054 --> 11:39.522
You should know,
she's fallen gravely ill.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.126
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

11:44.128 --> 11:46.395
Do you understand what
I'm saying?

11:46.397 --> 11:48.465
Go... on.

11:48.467 --> 11:50.567
Go on and be gone!

11:50.569 --> 11:53.570
I don't care about anyone,
anything, anywhere anymore.

11:55.073 --> 11:57.208
The birds will show you out.

11:59.278 --> 12:01.143
Right, everything's tidy.

12:01.145 --> 12:03.247
Lunch will be served in a minute now.

12:09.555 --> 12:10.687
Mmm!

12:10.689 --> 12:12.589
Smells lovely, Doc.

12:12.591 --> 12:14.157
Thanks very much.

12:14.159 --> 12:16.462
Hey, Doc, save some
for us this time.

12:20.432 --> 12:22.699
Sorry, Doc.
Guess I'm scared of kids, too.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.269
Don't worry about that.
Come on, let's eat.

12:25.271 --> 12:27.705
I'm going to be offering today
a brothy soup.

12:27.707 --> 12:30.374
You'll never believe
what we caught in the net.

12:30.376 --> 12:32.342
The queen has asked for you
by name, sir.

12:32.344 --> 12:33.678
Are you hard of hearing?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.580
I told you,
I'm closed for business.

12:40.152 --> 12:42.252
What business?

12:42.254 --> 12:44.187
Treating humans.

12:47.327 --> 12:48.893
Intruder alert.

12:51.731 --> 12:53.498
Don't worry. I'm fine.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.366
Well, I'm not.

12:55.368 --> 12:57.168
My house is descending
into chaos.

12:57.170 --> 12:58.603
I-Is he yours?

12:58.605 --> 13:01.339
I don't own anybody.

13:01.341 --> 13:03.741
Yoshi had an issue
that he came to me with.

13:05.579 --> 13:08.212
He's always cold.

13:08.214 --> 13:10.350
I have an injured squirrel.

13:11.418 --> 13:13.318
I don't know what to do.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.088
How was he injured?

13:16.189 --> 13:17.623
I...

13:17.625 --> 13:19.357
I-I shot him.

13:19.359 --> 13:21.192
What? I can't hear you.

13:21.194 --> 13:23.361
I shot him,
but it was an accident.

13:23.363 --> 13:26.230
Of course,
an accidental firing upon.

13:26.232 --> 13:28.534
Humans never change.

13:28.536 --> 13:31.403
He's very hurt.

13:31.405 --> 13:33.708
Please help him.

13:42.617 --> 13:44.516
Take that.

13:44.518 --> 13:46.387
And this.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.325
I...

13:53.327 --> 13:55.795
I... I...

13:55.797 --> 13:58.499
I'm too beautiful to die.

14:03.705 --> 14:05.506
Oh.

14:15.817 --> 14:17.684
Yes?

14:17.686 --> 14:19.786
He's with us.

14:19.788 --> 14:23.823
Dab-Dab, Jip, light the lamps
and disinfect the surgery.

14:23.825 --> 14:25.492
You will not tend to a squirrel

14:25.494 --> 14:27.761
while the queen of England's
life hangs in the balance.

14:27.763 --> 14:30.363
Oh, you don't know me
very well, do you?

14:30.365 --> 14:31.631
Don't drop him.

14:31.633 --> 14:33.000
We got a code red.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.503
Code red, code red, everybody.

14:35.771 --> 14:38.005
The doctor is back!

14:39.508 --> 14:41.008
Hang on, little buddy.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.010
Whew!
I haven't done this in a while.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.280
Let's get everything
the way Doc likes it.

14:46.682 --> 14:48.583
Don't worry. We got you, pal.

14:56.324 --> 14:58.494
Righto. Let's save
this squirrel, shall we?

14:59.595 --> 15:01.361
Okay.

15:01.363 --> 15:03.631
When you wake up,
everything will be fine.

15:03.633 --> 15:05.466
If I die, I swear
I will haunt your house.

15:05.468 --> 15:06.667
Sterilize the scalpels.

15:06.669 --> 15:08.269
Do not lick any instruments.

15:08.271 --> 15:09.637
Patient's condition
has stabilized.

15:11.507 --> 15:14.775
They're understanding him,
and he's understanding them,

15:14.777 --> 15:16.744
in their own languages.

15:21.818 --> 15:24.618
Going through the left
ventricle... it's brilliant.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.054
Wow.

15:26.056 --> 15:27.621
Dab-Dab, forceps, please.

15:27.623 --> 15:28.789
Here you go.

15:28.791 --> 15:30.491
That's a piece of celery.

15:30.493 --> 15:31.625
Forceps, Dab-Dab.

15:31.627 --> 15:33.494
Oh, sorry. Here you go.

15:33.496 --> 15:34.763
Still celery.

15:34.765 --> 15:35.797
Forceps?

15:35.799 --> 15:37.631
- Carrot, that is.
- Forceps?

15:37.633 --> 15:39.366
That's a different piece
of celery.

15:39.368 --> 15:40.367
Got it. Forceps.

15:40.369 --> 15:41.636
No, still celery.

15:41.638 --> 15:43.872
Never mind. I'll get it myself.

15:43.874 --> 15:46.777
I want to know how to talk
to the animals.

15:47.878 --> 15:50.545
Chee-Chee, brow.

15:50.547 --> 15:52.748
My brow as well,
when you've got a second.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.516
Right. Sorry.

15:54.518 --> 15:58.086
I'm going to come here
and be Dolittle's apprentice.

15:58.088 --> 16:01.358
Her Majesty has designated
this land a nature preserve.

16:02.426 --> 16:03.625
If she dies,

16:03.627 --> 16:06.495
the deed will be owned
by the Treasury,

16:06.497 --> 16:08.665
and this place goes away.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.566
- Shut down?
- Mm-hmm.

16:11.568 --> 16:12.870
There you are.

16:14.404 --> 16:15.570
Whoo, still got it, Doc.

16:15.572 --> 16:17.339
Oh, wow.

16:17.341 --> 16:18.875
Ah.

16:18.877 --> 16:20.408
There, Cheech.

16:20.410 --> 16:21.911
That's the spot.

16:21.913 --> 16:24.412
Keep an eye on Kevin, shall we?

16:24.414 --> 16:26.916
He may be prickly
when the anesthetic wears off.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.457
Revenge.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.391
Okay, okay.

16:36.393 --> 16:38.394
Enough with the pampering.

16:38.396 --> 16:40.963
You need to go
and help the queen.

16:40.965 --> 16:44.534
There are things
I no longer do:

16:44.536 --> 16:46.836
work with humans
or leave the house.

16:46.838 --> 16:48.838
- Or bathe.
- Oh, exercise.

16:48.840 --> 16:53.576
Express emotional
vulnerability.

16:53.578 --> 16:54.977
Wake up, John.

16:54.979 --> 16:57.413
If the queen dies,
the Treasury takes the deed,

16:57.415 --> 16:59.582
and we'd lose this house.

16:59.584 --> 17:02.485
You're talking out of
your tail feathers, Poly.

17:02.487 --> 17:04.453
The deed was for life.

17:04.455 --> 17:07.623
The last time I checked,
I was very much alive.

17:07.625 --> 17:09.661
The queen's life, John,
not yours.

17:10.729 --> 17:11.995
Look at that.

17:11.997 --> 17:14.597
It just rolls off my back.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.601
I knew I shouldn't have let
monkeys proofread the contract.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.537
Elliot, Elsie, you are fired!

17:22.541 --> 17:24.942
It gets worse. We'll be
thrown out of these gates

17:24.944 --> 17:27.010
right in the middle
of hunting season!

17:27.012 --> 17:28.512
- What?
- No, no, no.

17:28.514 --> 17:29.780
Breathe, Chee-Chee.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.648
We get kicked out
if the queen dies?

17:31.650 --> 17:33.684
- We're gonna be hunted!
- Everybody, calm down.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.621
- Look at the state of him now.
- Fear not.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.490
I have an in at, uh,
Regent's Park Zoo.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.893
Everyone, pack your bags!

17:43.963 --> 17:45.529
Ah-ah.

17:45.531 --> 17:48.899
You help the queen,
or we are leaving.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.636
- You're bluffing.
- Don't make me count.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.504
Don't make me count.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.773
One.

17:55.775 --> 17:56.841
Three!

17:56.843 --> 17:58.042
Two.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.911
All right!

17:59.913 --> 18:01.511
I'll do it.

18:01.513 --> 18:03.513
Marvelous.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.449
Right, let's get you
ready to go, honey.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.218
- I'll go as I am.
- Not looking like that.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.786
- Just grab my doctor's bag.
- Get him.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.787
Apologies, Doc.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.222
Hold still, now.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.025
Take your paws off me!

18:14.027 --> 18:16.694
- This isn't gonna hurt a bit.
- Let's clean him up.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.730
How dare you.

18:18.732 --> 18:20.698
- Whoa.
- Oh, hey, guys.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.634
Arthur? How long have you
been living in there?

18:22.636 --> 18:24.602
I don't know.
What year is it?

18:25.739 --> 18:26.971
Dab-Dab's got the razor.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.740
That's still celery.

18:28.742 --> 18:31.411
Nighty-night, Doc.

18:38.953 --> 18:41.552
Dolittle used to
travel all around the world.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.821
Look.

18:43.858 --> 18:45.824
Rummaging through
my private projects, is it?

18:45.826 --> 18:47.927
How is he?

18:47.929 --> 18:49.728
Well, first things first,

18:49.730 --> 18:51.897
the squirrel's name is Kevin.

18:51.899 --> 18:53.666
Expect a full recovery.

18:53.668 --> 18:56.602
And after some violent
grooming, it's been decided.

18:56.604 --> 18:59.707
We will accompany you
to Buckingham Palace after all.

19:00.841 --> 19:03.542
Hmm.
You are going back

19:03.544 --> 19:05.978
to whatever burrow
you emerged from.

19:05.980 --> 19:08.783
Try not to shoot anything
on your way home.

19:19.727 --> 19:21.995
Maybe I-I should stay here.
I don't do well in crowds.

19:21.997 --> 19:23.629
We'll look after you, Cheech.

19:23.631 --> 19:26.132
But we all go together,
just like the old days.

19:26.134 --> 19:27.934
Oh, don't forget Doc's forceps.

19:27.936 --> 19:29.635
That's a leek, Dab-Dab.

19:29.637 --> 19:31.037
Sure it is.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.604
Styx?

19:32.606 --> 19:33.773
No.

19:33.775 --> 19:35.842
Where are you? Oh.

19:35.844 --> 19:37.844
So, uh, would you care
to come along?

19:40.582 --> 19:43.016
I know.
I had other plans as well.

19:44.152 --> 19:46.021
Hurry up. Hurry up.

19:47.656 --> 19:48.890
Shh!

20:12.881 --> 20:15.782
Prepare my ride.

20:15.784 --> 20:17.584
Today's gonna be a good day.

20:17.586 --> 20:19.719
I'm gonna do nothing...
just prance around,

20:19.721 --> 20:20.921
think my own thoughts and...

20:20.923 --> 20:23.057
- Oh, he's walking this way. Not a great sign.
- Oh, uh...

20:23.059 --> 20:24.692
He's got no beard.
He looks motivated.

20:24.694 --> 20:25.926
Uh, no. Plimpton, don't be alarmed.

20:25.928 --> 20:28.162
People only say that when
they're about to be alarming.

20:28.164 --> 20:29.797
- Look, I know it's been a while.
- Sorry about this.

20:29.799 --> 20:33.067
- And sorry about that.
- All right.

20:33.069 --> 20:34.635
I'm unavailable.

20:34.637 --> 20:35.803
Unavailable for the man
who changed your life?

20:35.805 --> 20:37.772
We're going to save
the queen, bro!

20:37.774 --> 20:39.707
I am not your bro.

20:39.709 --> 20:41.609
You should be
an Eskimo's rug by now.

20:41.611 --> 20:42.843
- Ow. Claws.
- Ow! Beak!

20:42.845 --> 20:43.978
- Claws.
- Beak!

20:43.980 --> 20:45.713
Now, now, gentlemen.

20:45.715 --> 20:48.682
Oh, you've gained weight.

20:48.684 --> 20:50.218
Why are you riding me?

20:50.220 --> 20:52.620
There's, like, four horses
in front of us.

20:52.622 --> 20:54.021
Cheer up, angry bird.

20:54.023 --> 20:56.124
Kick back and enjoy the ride.

20:56.126 --> 20:58.160
I am the ride.

21:01.098 --> 21:03.231
Buckingham Palace.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.903
We've hit the big time!

21:08.972 --> 21:11.175
Full speed no longer required!

21:15.813 --> 21:18.246
Whoa.

21:18.248 --> 21:20.248
Welcome home, milady.

21:23.887 --> 21:25.253
Guards! Guards!

21:30.994 --> 21:32.828
Your ladyship, Rose.

21:32.830 --> 21:35.063
They are the queen's
own guests.

21:35.065 --> 21:37.032
Treat them accordingly.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.867
You better
give us a wide berth.

21:38.869 --> 21:39.968
Make way, boys.

21:39.970 --> 21:42.838
Plimpton, don't. Stop.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.773
- Don't stop? Odd decision, but...
- Stop!

21:44.775 --> 21:47.443
Whoa!

21:50.747 --> 21:52.048
Aah! Can't see!

21:52.050 --> 21:54.052
Oh, my God.

21:56.121 --> 21:57.887
Oh, uh...

21:57.889 --> 21:59.856
Okay.

21:59.858 --> 22:01.893
I blame the hat.

22:12.003 --> 22:13.838
Dr. Müdfly.

22:14.906 --> 22:16.072
Lord Badgley.

22:16.074 --> 22:17.173
My lord.

22:17.175 --> 22:19.909
I come from the House of Lords.

22:19.911 --> 22:22.814
There is great concern
for Her Majesty's health.

22:24.916 --> 22:27.717
I shall continue to leech

22:27.719 --> 22:31.321
to circulate the vapors
in the bloodstream.

22:31.323 --> 22:34.226
She'll be lucky
to last the week.

22:37.795 --> 22:40.330
This is not the first time
Dr. Dolittle's been here.

22:40.332 --> 22:43.000
You got a dying queen?
Not for long.

22:43.002 --> 22:44.835
Dr. Dolittle is in the...

22:47.139 --> 22:49.072
Oh, uh, wait. Wait for me!

22:49.074 --> 22:52.109
A stowaway, my lady,
who claims to be Dr....

22:52.111 --> 22:53.844
Dr. Dolittle's apprentice.

22:53.846 --> 22:55.214
It's quite all right, Gareth.

22:57.883 --> 22:59.183
Well, if he was my apprentice,

22:59.185 --> 23:02.753
he should fetch my bags
and keep his gob shut.

23:06.225 --> 23:08.959
- A bird.
- A duck.

23:08.961 --> 23:11.094
Animals in the queen's chamber?

23:11.096 --> 23:13.164
I demand their
immediate remov...

23:13.166 --> 23:14.898
Ah, Lady Rose.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.800
My apologies.
Please forgive me.

23:16.802 --> 23:18.902
I didn't realize
that you were part of...

23:18.904 --> 23:20.238
John Dolittle?

23:20.240 --> 23:22.873
- Is that Blaine?
- Blair.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.142
Poopfling?

23:24.144 --> 23:25.109
- No.
- It was Mudflap?

23:25.111 --> 23:27.946
- No, it's Müdfly.
- It was... Müdfly.

23:27.948 --> 23:29.780
- With an umlaut.
- Yes.

23:29.782 --> 23:30.982
- From the German.
- Of course.

23:30.984 --> 23:32.850
- From the Germans.
- Why is he here?

23:32.852 --> 23:35.222
Her Majesty has personally
requested Dr. Dolittle.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.133
Well, then, let's get to work.

23:49.135 --> 23:51.905
All right, Jip,
give her a good sniff.

23:59.179 --> 24:00.945
- That dog is licking the queen.
- Don't worry, my love.

24:00.947 --> 24:02.147
This is outrageous.

24:09.823 --> 24:11.290
Oh, bark.

24:11.292 --> 24:14.159
- You all right, fellow?
- Something smelled wrong.

24:14.161 --> 24:16.829
And that's coming from a guy
who loves the smell of butts.

24:16.831 --> 24:18.030
Oh, you do love butt.

24:18.032 --> 24:19.932
I detected a whiff
of something else.

24:19.934 --> 24:21.233
Floral, with earthy...

24:24.272 --> 24:25.871
I'm perplexed, Doc.

24:25.873 --> 24:27.840
I've never smelt anything
like it before.

24:27.842 --> 24:31.844
Uh, clearly, Jipsy and I
are out of our depths.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.846
- May we consult?
- Well, of course.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.283
I'd be more than happy
to help illuminate...

24:56.937 --> 25:00.974
John and I were students
at Edinburgh years ago.

25:00.976 --> 25:04.880
Some thought he had
a gift for observation.

25:11.987 --> 25:13.286
One minute.

25:18.661 --> 25:21.129
Oh, sorry about that, Mini.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.066
Stay here.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.001
Dab-Dab, clear out the humans.

25:28.003 --> 25:30.504
Boyo, fetch the "Botanical
Index" and the tea tin.

25:30.506 --> 25:31.605
Everyone out.

25:31.607 --> 25:34.140
Do you understand the words
coming out of my bill?

25:38.247 --> 25:39.979
What do you smell, Jip?

25:39.981 --> 25:41.315
Elderberries?

25:41.317 --> 25:43.451
Hemlock?

25:43.453 --> 25:46.954
Negative.

25:46.956 --> 25:48.257
Negative.

25:51.194 --> 25:52.360
Aye, aye.

26:00.503 --> 26:02.336
What have you found, Dolittle?

26:02.338 --> 26:04.338
Well, quite possibly,
the answer to everything.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.006
Exposure to toxic...

26:06.008 --> 26:07.408
God, he was like this
at school.

26:07.410 --> 26:09.009
"Lean in, lean in.

26:09.011 --> 26:10.978
I'm saying something
interesting."

26:10.980 --> 26:12.447
I am interested.

26:12.449 --> 26:14.716
The queen's symptoms
are due to the effect

26:14.718 --> 26:16.551
of a rare Sumatran plant

26:16.553 --> 26:19.354
known as the nightshade flower.

26:19.356 --> 26:24.024
A solar eclipse will occur
on the 17th of this very month.

26:24.026 --> 26:26.428
If she has not received
the antidote by then,

26:26.430 --> 26:28.165
she will perish.

26:29.433 --> 26:31.299
Is that a Turner?

26:31.301 --> 26:33.535
Must be.
What a fine painting.

26:33.537 --> 26:36.438
I say, Dolittle,
what is your plan?

26:36.440 --> 26:38.039
The plan?

26:38.041 --> 26:40.742
Uh, I suppose we do need one.

26:40.744 --> 26:42.244
Well, the queen's only hope

26:42.246 --> 26:44.045
is a cure that's
never been tested,

26:44.047 --> 26:45.748
from a tree
that's never been seen,

26:45.750 --> 26:48.049
on an island
that's never been found.

26:48.051 --> 26:49.518
Sounds ridiculous
saying it out loud.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.088
But regardless of that...

26:52.456 --> 26:54.423
...we have no choice
but to embark

26:54.425 --> 26:56.258
on this perilous journey

26:56.260 --> 26:59.094
to obtain the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

26:59.096 --> 27:00.530
What?

27:00.532 --> 27:03.499
Eden Tree. Oh, my. Fantastic.

27:03.501 --> 27:07.403
The Dolittles with
their Eden Tree Island.

27:07.405 --> 27:10.038
- Isn't it enough that your wife...
- Shut up, Blair!

27:10.040 --> 27:11.340
Sorry, I-I meant to say:

27:11.342 --> 27:14.042
"Lovely to see you
again, Blair."

27:14.044 --> 27:16.579
We're off now. Ta-ra.

27:16.581 --> 27:19.782
Oh, its fruit is said to cure
every malady known to man,

27:19.784 --> 27:21.350
grant eternal life,

27:21.352 --> 27:23.319
even restore
the hair on your head.

27:23.321 --> 27:25.421
You must let nothing
pass her lips

27:25.423 --> 27:27.790
that hasn't been made
and served by you.

27:27.792 --> 27:29.125
Clear?

27:29.127 --> 27:31.260
Yes, I'll see to it.

27:31.262 --> 27:32.796
That's us to the carriage.

27:32.798 --> 27:35.198
Jip, you need to stay behind
and guard the queen.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.633
- Very important.
- Right, guard dog mode.

27:37.635 --> 27:40.505
Stand back, everyone,
while I secure the perimeter.

27:43.374 --> 27:44.510
Excuse me.

27:48.581 --> 27:51.415
I do so admire
how you don't give up.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.550
The queen is counting
on both of you.

27:53.552 --> 27:55.354
Good luck.

27:58.224 --> 28:00.056
Right. Chop-chop.

28:00.058 --> 28:02.058
We got a long voyage
in front of us,

28:02.060 --> 28:04.394
and the boat isn't
gonna sail itself.

28:04.396 --> 28:06.597
Deep breath, Yoshi.

28:06.599 --> 28:09.600
We haven't got all day.

28:09.602 --> 28:11.301
Seems like she's full up.

28:11.303 --> 28:13.570
Maybe we could
squeeze in one more.

28:13.572 --> 28:15.272
Plenty of room.

28:15.274 --> 28:17.541
- Oh, no.
- Uh, Plimpton.

28:17.543 --> 28:20.177
I mean, one more stop,
good fellow.

28:20.179 --> 28:22.579
I can't hear you,
because I am not here.

28:22.581 --> 28:25.549
Well, I believe it's time
to go our separate ways.

28:25.551 --> 28:27.384
Uh, I'm going with you.

28:27.386 --> 28:28.686
Certainly not.

28:28.688 --> 28:30.153
It's far too treacherous.

28:30.155 --> 28:31.288
I'm your apprentice.

28:31.290 --> 28:32.489
You? No, no, no.

28:32.491 --> 28:34.124
Oh, you have an apprentice?

28:34.126 --> 28:35.560
You don't need an apprentice
and an ostrich.

28:35.562 --> 28:37.094
I'll go home.

28:37.096 --> 28:38.262
I didn't want
to be embarrassed,

28:38.264 --> 28:39.464
so I pretended you belonged.

28:39.466 --> 28:41.432
I was helpful in there,
wasn't I?

28:41.434 --> 28:43.434
- Hmm...
- The animals like me.

28:43.436 --> 28:46.103
I don't take up much space.

28:46.105 --> 28:48.439
I think I belong here.

28:48.441 --> 28:51.175
Don't make me go home.

28:51.177 --> 28:52.646
Please.

29:04.190 --> 29:05.723
What is that around your neck?

29:05.725 --> 29:07.258
Come on.

29:07.260 --> 29:09.160
<i>I'm worried about the boy,
Bethan.</i>

29:09.162 --> 29:11.129
Give him time. Time is all.

29:11.131 --> 29:12.597
We're hunters, Bethan.

29:12.599 --> 29:15.500
Hunters.
It has a certain...

29:15.502 --> 29:17.201
We hunt things.

29:17.203 --> 29:18.469
He frees things.

29:18.471 --> 29:20.204
Like rabbits and mice.

29:20.206 --> 29:22.340
He carries spiders outside.

29:22.342 --> 29:24.679
Nobody likes spiders...
not even spiders.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.614
I don't know how your sister
put up with him.

29:50.738 --> 29:53.172
Ugh. Ugh.

29:54.375 --> 29:56.375
Poly?
What are you doing here?

29:56.377 --> 29:58.611
Making sure
you don't miss the boat.

29:58.613 --> 30:03.282
A-Am I talking to an animal,
just like Dolittle?

30:03.284 --> 30:05.517
Oh, no.
I'm speaking human.

30:05.519 --> 30:07.453
Better than any parrot
ever has, actually.

30:08.790 --> 30:11.390
Now, let's pack some clothes.
Come on.

30:16.398 --> 30:19.264
But Dolittle said
I belong here.

30:19.266 --> 30:21.601
Little help, Tutu?

30:21.603 --> 30:24.537
Well, I never heard him say
anything of the sort.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.408
There's something special
about you, Stubbins.

30:28.410 --> 30:32.278
Something I've only seen
in two other humans.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.681
You belong with us, kid.

30:34.683 --> 30:37.717
And you let me worry
about Dolittle. That's my job.

30:37.719 --> 30:42.424
So, are you ready for
the adventure of a lifetime?

30:46.829 --> 30:48.561
I'm in.

30:48.563 --> 30:50.330
Of course you are.

30:50.332 --> 30:51.431
Poly, let's move.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.601
We got a boat to catch,
and we're burning daylight.

30:53.603 --> 30:55.301
Fret not, <i>ma chérie.</i>

30:55.303 --> 30:57.303
We have the perfect plan.

30:57.305 --> 30:58.572
New plan!

30:58.574 --> 30:59.840
New plan!

30:59.842 --> 31:02.443
Come on!
Don't let them get away!

31:03.579 --> 31:05.379
Why are they chasing us?

31:05.381 --> 31:06.681
We're not criminals.

31:06.683 --> 31:08.315
Speak for yourself.

31:08.317 --> 31:09.850
We're wanted in three forests.

31:09.852 --> 31:12.853
And it's not an escape mission
unless you're being chased.

31:12.855 --> 31:15.489
Whoa!

31:15.491 --> 31:17.391
That tickles!

31:17.393 --> 31:18.626
Which way, Tutu?

31:18.628 --> 31:21.295
- Down!
- Whoa!

31:21.297 --> 31:23.264
Clear the way!

31:23.266 --> 31:24.598
Hey! This way!

31:24.600 --> 31:27.535
Get off the road, <i>ma chérie.</i>

31:27.537 --> 31:30.337
See you later, suckers.

31:35.813 --> 31:38.279
Whew. We've done it.

31:38.281 --> 31:39.781
We've done it. We...

31:39.783 --> 31:41.717
Missed it.

31:41.719 --> 31:44.285
Okay, boss,
what's our next move?

31:44.287 --> 31:46.488
We cut our losses,
change our identities,

31:46.490 --> 31:47.789
ditch the kid in the river.

31:47.791 --> 31:49.356
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

31:49.358 --> 31:50.627
Wh-Wh-What about that bridge?

31:51.695 --> 31:52.794
Yes, the bridge.

31:52.796 --> 31:54.696
Uh, that was
my next suggestion.

31:54.698 --> 31:55.766
Let's go!

31:57.701 --> 31:58.900
Come on, Doc.

31:58.902 --> 32:00.602
At least get out
of the hammock.

32:00.604 --> 32:03.338
Your seasickness will wear off.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.373
Try some of this ginger root.

32:05.375 --> 32:07.375
You'll get your sea legs back.
You look terrible.

32:07.377 --> 32:08.677
Ah, button it.

32:08.679 --> 32:10.645
Who put me in this hammock?

32:10.647 --> 32:13.782
I am the captain
of this ship, right?

32:13.784 --> 32:16.384
Raise the blasted sails, will you?

32:16.386 --> 32:19.554
Uh, that's a big bite.

32:21.558 --> 32:22.792
Everyone, look.

32:22.794 --> 32:24.526
Is that the boy?

32:24.528 --> 32:26.095
He's coming to finish the job!

32:26.097 --> 32:27.764
He won't rest till I'm dead!

32:27.766 --> 32:29.397
He's obsessed!

32:29.399 --> 32:31.801
- John, slow the boat down.
- No.

32:31.803 --> 32:34.504
- I want to go faster. I want...
- Sorry, kid. Doc says no.

32:34.506 --> 32:35.938
We're going to miss
all the good current!

32:35.940 --> 32:38.808
- I hope you make it.
- Me, too, Dabs.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.680
- All right, Bets, moment of truth.
- Okay.

32:44.682 --> 32:47.817
Oh, big hole, 12 o'clock!

32:47.819 --> 32:49.452
Maybe this is a bad idea.

32:51.890 --> 32:53.123
- Let's go, Stubbins, let's go!
- Come on, kid.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.390
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!

32:55.760 --> 32:56.826
I've run out of track!

32:56.828 --> 32:58.594
But not courage!

32:58.596 --> 33:00.830
- Fly and be free!
- Whoa!

33:07.572 --> 33:09.474
<i>Vive la résistance!</i>

33:12.577 --> 33:14.412
- Whoa!
- Is that thing up to code?

33:15.915 --> 33:17.648
Whoa. Whoa.

33:26.492 --> 33:27.858
No!

33:27.860 --> 33:28.959
No.

33:30.696 --> 33:32.796
Jump, murderer.
You got this.

33:39.772 --> 33:41.538
Oh, I can't look.

33:45.544 --> 33:47.744
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

33:50.850 --> 33:52.851
Do it again! Do it again!

33:52.853 --> 33:55.552
- Do it again! Do it again!
- Yes!

33:55.554 --> 33:57.454
- Crushed it, kid.
- Do it again! Do it again!

33:57.456 --> 33:58.689
You made it.

33:58.691 --> 34:01.759
Why y'all cheering
for the kid who shot me?

34:01.761 --> 34:03.828
Ah, he's all right.

34:03.830 --> 34:05.495
Darling.

34:05.497 --> 34:07.497
- Can I have a word, please? Huh.
- Glad you came around

34:07.499 --> 34:09.734
and saw things my...

34:09.736 --> 34:12.036
What was she thinking?

34:12.038 --> 34:14.439
The boy nearly killed himself.

34:14.441 --> 34:16.641
Oi! This is my ship, right?

34:16.643 --> 34:18.509
And I'm its sovereign.

34:18.511 --> 34:19.711
And there are consequences...

34:19.713 --> 34:20.745
To ignoring me.

34:20.747 --> 34:22.513
- Is that what you were going to say?
- No, no.

34:22.515 --> 34:23.915
Don't mince my words.

34:23.917 --> 34:25.917
And stop messing
with my routine.

34:25.919 --> 34:28.519
But look at the state of you.
You're sick as a dog.

34:28.521 --> 34:30.521
Uh, but actually,
I have my medicine.

34:30.523 --> 34:33.524
See? This licorice root
is working a treat.

34:33.526 --> 34:35.860
Sit down, John.

34:37.664 --> 34:39.865
Don't embarrass me
in front of the crew.

34:39.867 --> 34:42.500
I'm sparing you embarrassment.

34:42.502 --> 34:43.769
You need a trim.

34:43.771 --> 34:45.603
All right, all right, be quick.

34:45.605 --> 34:47.940
It's important to maintain
my status, yeah?

34:47.942 --> 34:50.809
This ship is dangerous...
no place for a... Ow.

34:50.811 --> 34:51.810
- Ow!
- What? - Huh?

34:51.812 --> 34:52.845
Hurts, man!

34:52.847 --> 34:54.546
Private conversation.

34:54.548 --> 34:55.814
- Oh, okay. - Okay.
- Sorry.

34:57.551 --> 35:00.886
I know this particular voyage
is hard for you, John.

35:00.888 --> 35:02.821
It is for me, too.

35:02.823 --> 35:05.557
I brought you Lily
just when you needed her,

35:05.559 --> 35:08.261
and now you need
one of your own kind again.

35:08.263 --> 35:12.265
Someone without feathers
or fur.

35:12.267 --> 35:14.700
Fine, the boy can stay,
but it'll be on my terms.

35:14.702 --> 35:16.102
And I'll keep him quite busy.

35:16.104 --> 35:18.572
You'll do it
with a smile on your face.

35:19.774 --> 35:20.973
Crew!

35:20.975 --> 35:23.979
Seems you got a new shipmate.

35:27.715 --> 35:29.983
As I just told Poly,

35:29.985 --> 35:32.551
we are a bit shorthanded
after all, so...

35:32.553 --> 35:33.787
You won't regret it.

35:33.789 --> 35:34.955
Welcome aboard.

35:34.957 --> 35:36.823
I hear you could be
a big help...

35:36.825 --> 35:38.590
...by cleaning this up.

35:38.592 --> 35:40.026
That, too,
if you wouldn't mind.

35:40.028 --> 35:41.661
Oops. Those as well.

35:41.663 --> 35:43.663
And that.

35:43.665 --> 35:44.998
I got these.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.469
Careful with that
medical equipment.

35:49.771 --> 35:53.008
Because a parrot's in charge
of my ship! Brilliant!

35:54.643 --> 35:57.612
He's absolutely thrilled
to have you.

36:10.625 --> 36:13.060
Hmm.

36:13.062 --> 36:14.962
Hello there, little squid.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.564
You don't understand me,
do you?

36:17.566 --> 36:19.033
That would be preposterous.

36:19.035 --> 36:22.036
- Müdfly.
- I wasn't talking to the squid!

36:22.038 --> 36:25.973
I'm dispatching a frigate,
the <i>Britannia,</i>

36:25.975 --> 36:28.676
to follow Dolittle.

36:28.678 --> 36:32.582
But you must not support him
in his foolishness, my lord.

36:37.153 --> 36:39.120
England has enemies everywhere

36:39.122 --> 36:43.057
waiting for the slightest
sign of weakness.

36:43.059 --> 36:46.594
Entrusting beloved Britain
to a child queen?

36:46.596 --> 36:48.596
That is lunacy.

36:48.598 --> 36:49.964
So, while I remain here

36:49.966 --> 36:52.933
ensuring no one prevents me
from taking the throne,

36:52.935 --> 36:55.870
you will be on the <i>Britannia</i>

36:55.872 --> 37:00.077
making certain
Dolittle never returns.

37:13.824 --> 37:15.090
Great. Round two, yeah?

37:15.092 --> 37:17.225
You got me on the ropes,
you have, Cheech.

37:17.227 --> 37:19.027
Come on. One, two.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.695
Jab, jab, cross.

37:21.499 --> 37:22.831
The best form of defense
is attack.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.751
I really don't want
to fight you.

37:42.753 --> 37:44.253
We're not fighting, are we?

37:44.255 --> 37:45.789
It's a therapeutic session.

37:56.434 --> 37:58.034
I-I think I'm getting this.

37:58.036 --> 37:59.838
I'm actually starting
to understand.

38:32.171 --> 38:35.771
<i>Stop worrying, John.</i>

38:35.773 --> 38:39.042
<i>Every step is planned out
in my journal.</i>

38:39.044 --> 38:42.747
<i>I'll be back
before you even miss me.</i>

38:52.191 --> 38:54.160
Are you all right?

38:57.196 --> 38:59.497
I think I'm beginning
to understand

38:59.499 --> 39:01.965
a little bit of what
the animals are saying.

39:01.967 --> 39:03.736
Seems you are, boyo.

39:12.179 --> 39:14.878
What kind of polar bear
works on their tan?

39:14.880 --> 39:16.813
Well, what kind of bird...

39:16.815 --> 39:18.782
Wait, are you even a bird?

39:18.784 --> 39:20.351
- Of course I am.
- Well, can you fly?

39:20.353 --> 39:21.818
- No.
- Can you swim?

39:21.820 --> 39:22.819
No.

39:22.821 --> 39:23.955
Well, what can you do?

39:23.957 --> 39:25.523
- I can run.
- I can run.

39:25.525 --> 39:27.225
What bird stuff can you do?

39:27.227 --> 39:29.294
Well, what bear stuff
can you do?

39:31.831 --> 39:33.200
You win this round.

39:45.546 --> 39:46.945
Ro...

39:48.014 --> 39:49.280
Pickles?

39:50.917 --> 39:53.117
Oh, you were saying "warship."

39:54.287 --> 39:56.221
Weird time to be asking
for pickles.

39:56.223 --> 39:58.122
I mean, who could eat
when we're under attack?

39:58.124 --> 40:00.858
Enemy, starboard aft.

40:00.860 --> 40:03.861
Elliott, you and Elsie
ready the machine.

40:03.863 --> 40:07.066
We're gonna need speed.
Send out the call.

40:13.074 --> 40:14.139
Which way are the lifeboats?

40:14.141 --> 40:15.274
This whole thing is
a death boat.

40:15.276 --> 40:16.875
Mini, mind the lookout.

40:16.877 --> 40:19.878
Stubbins, boy, I need you
now more than ever...

40:19.880 --> 40:21.981
- to stand still.
- I surrender!

40:21.983 --> 40:23.349
We surrender!

40:23.351 --> 40:25.217
Oh...

40:25.219 --> 40:27.820
hello, Blair,
you chinless wonder.

40:28.823 --> 40:32.291
He said something
about my chin, didn't he?

40:32.293 --> 40:34.293
It's a magnificent chin, sir.

40:34.295 --> 40:35.894
We're in their sights.

40:35.896 --> 40:37.430
Cannons are taking aim.

40:37.432 --> 40:40.165
Let's turn this ship!

40:41.902 --> 40:44.169
I'm on my way.

40:44.171 --> 40:48.009
It is time for me to slip into
something less comfortable.

40:55.083 --> 40:58.084
Hello...!

40:58.086 --> 41:00.188
I bought a front-row seat
to crazy town.

41:03.325 --> 41:04.958
Once Humphrey's been secured,

41:04.960 --> 41:06.926
you pull me out
on Yoshi's signal.

41:06.928 --> 41:09.296
Me? No, I-I can't handle
that type of pressure, Doc.

41:09.298 --> 41:12.132
I'm a "cheer quietly from
the sidelines" kind of gorilla.

41:12.134 --> 41:13.900
Don't worry, Cheech.

41:13.902 --> 41:16.269
You'll rise
to the occasion, huh?

41:16.271 --> 41:19.139
You're stronger than you know.

41:19.141 --> 41:22.942
Now, remember, courage
is not the absence of fear.

41:22.944 --> 41:25.413
Wait. You got cut off.

41:25.415 --> 41:27.113
I-I can't hear you.

41:27.115 --> 41:28.882
I need the second part!

41:28.884 --> 41:31.053
No time, Cheech. Let's go.

41:42.298 --> 41:43.664
Oh, look, look.

41:43.666 --> 41:45.466
They're already
abandoning ship.

41:45.468 --> 41:47.370
Boom!

41:53.142 --> 41:54.475
Oh, this is gonna be cold.

41:54.477 --> 41:56.412
But I'm coming in hot!

42:03.353 --> 42:05.052
Humphrey here.

42:05.054 --> 42:07.056
Let's hook it up.

42:15.131 --> 42:16.698
Where we headed?

42:16.700 --> 42:18.032
South.

42:22.506 --> 42:24.941
Okay, I can do this.
I can do this.

42:29.045 --> 42:30.712
Full steam ahead!

42:30.714 --> 42:32.383
Go, Humphrey, go!

42:33.550 --> 42:35.384
Are they pulling away?

42:36.520 --> 42:38.520
Do it, whale, do it!

42:38.522 --> 42:40.389
- Whoo-hoo!
- It's working!

42:40.391 --> 42:42.090
- How is this possible?
- Well, sir, it appears

42:42.092 --> 42:44.259
Dolittle and a polar bear
have harnessed a whale...

42:44.261 --> 42:46.528
It was a rhetorical question.

42:46.530 --> 42:47.464
Just fire!

42:53.303 --> 42:55.337
I dropped the rope!

43:04.047 --> 43:06.116
I failed.
I knew I couldn't do it.

43:18.062 --> 43:19.995
- Yoshi!
- Hang on.

43:19.997 --> 43:21.499
I'm coming, kid!

43:23.334 --> 43:25.334
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- You're doing great.

43:25.336 --> 43:27.136
Oh, this is gonna
murder my back.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.241
Quit complaining,
you oversized flamingo.

43:39.217 --> 43:40.316
Oh, no, no, no.

43:40.318 --> 43:41.519
Oh, no.

43:44.489 --> 43:47.223
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

44:02.174 --> 44:04.109
- Oh!
- Yes!

44:11.116 --> 44:13.217
I let you down, Doc.

44:13.219 --> 44:15.118
Look at me.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.087
I'm fine. We're all fine.

44:17.089 --> 44:19.323
- I froze.
- No, no, no, Cheech.

44:19.325 --> 44:21.291
It's okay to be scared.

44:21.293 --> 44:23.095
Mm-mm.

44:26.131 --> 44:27.531
You saved me, did you?

44:27.533 --> 44:28.833
Fair play.

44:28.835 --> 44:30.369
Thanks very much.

44:31.437 --> 44:33.403
Well done, everybody.

44:34.574 --> 44:37.140
Feel like you belong now, kid?

44:37.142 --> 44:39.076
I guess I do.

44:39.078 --> 44:40.545
- We lost 'em.
- I guess I do.

44:40.547 --> 44:42.279
Great work, gang.

44:42.281 --> 44:44.516
Eat our dust, Mudfly.

44:53.527 --> 44:55.293
- They've gotten away, sir.
- Oh, really?

44:55.295 --> 44:57.161
I thought they disappeared
into thin air.

44:57.163 --> 44:59.097
I'm afraid not, sir.
They've escaped.

44:59.099 --> 45:00.298
Read the room, Lieutenant!

45:00.300 --> 45:02.168
I can see they've escaped.

45:03.236 --> 45:05.639
But not for long.

45:07.307 --> 45:08.540
It's a miracle.

45:08.542 --> 45:11.175
That must mean
I am the chosen one.

45:11.177 --> 45:12.577
I'm gonna change the wor...

45:12.579 --> 45:15.480
Whale power.

45:15.482 --> 45:17.683
Dolittle had to write
a paper about it,

45:17.685 --> 45:20.385
which, of course,
nobody took seriously.

45:20.387 --> 45:23.421
This one even theorizes
the existence of dragons.

45:23.423 --> 45:26.257
Just preposterous.

45:26.259 --> 45:28.727
Sir, I'm afraid your obsession
with Dolittle is...

45:28.729 --> 45:30.596
What obsession?
I'm not obsessed with Dolittle.

45:30.598 --> 45:32.364
You're obsessed with Dolittle.

45:32.366 --> 45:34.669
You're the one obsessing
about my obsession with Dol...

45:36.737 --> 45:38.737
I'm loath to admit it,

45:38.739 --> 45:42.474
but he's more valuable alive
for now.

45:42.476 --> 45:44.510
But luckily,

45:44.512 --> 45:47.214
I think I know
where he's going.

45:50.418 --> 45:52.418
Kevin's log, day seven.

45:52.420 --> 45:53.719
I'm now totally isolated.

45:53.721 --> 45:55.521
The enemy has
ingratiated himself

45:55.523 --> 45:57.523
with the captain and crew.

45:57.525 --> 45:59.726
No sign of promised
tropical island

45:59.728 --> 46:01.695
or the magic fruit.

46:01.697 --> 46:03.632
But I will endure.

46:18.714 --> 46:20.480
Take the wheel, Stubbins.

46:20.482 --> 46:21.781
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

46:21.783 --> 46:23.650
I have to calculate
our route coordinates.

46:23.652 --> 46:25.518
The bees are buzzing about you.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.953
Seems you are getting

46:26.955 --> 46:29.956
a rudimentary grasp
of their language.

46:29.958 --> 46:33.593
35 degrees portside.

46:33.595 --> 46:37.731
Well, I-I have noticed when
they fly in a zigzag pattern,

46:37.733 --> 46:39.299
they sort of go...

46:41.770 --> 46:44.304
Which means: "Back off, kid."

46:44.306 --> 46:46.741
But when Dab-Dab goes, uh...

46:50.212 --> 46:51.712
That means: "Look at this."

46:51.714 --> 46:53.614
Mm. "Look at me."

46:53.616 --> 46:55.382
- Oh, close.
- Not bad, though.

46:55.384 --> 46:57.654
Oh, uh...
No, when Chee-Chee says...

46:58.721 --> 47:00.755
When Chee-Chee says...

47:03.693 --> 47:08.228
That means:
"Where's my... blanket?"

47:08.230 --> 47:09.499
Very good.

47:13.670 --> 47:16.003
Is that the map
of Eden Tree Island?

47:16.005 --> 47:19.540
The Eden Tree cannot
be found on any map.

47:19.542 --> 47:21.542
And to call it an island
is to suggest

47:21.544 --> 47:25.513
that it is of our world,
and it is anything but.

47:25.515 --> 47:28.349
That is why we must first go
to Monteverde,

47:28.351 --> 47:29.617
birthplace of the only person

47:29.619 --> 47:31.585
to ever chart a course
to the tree.

47:31.587 --> 47:32.821
Her name was Lily.

47:32.823 --> 47:35.489
She wrote the route
in a journal,

47:35.491 --> 47:37.726
but on her voyage,
she was shipwrecked.

47:37.728 --> 47:41.732
The world lost the greatest
explorer I've ever known.

47:43.767 --> 47:45.734
The journal
from that expedition

47:45.736 --> 47:47.671
was all that survived.

47:50.808 --> 47:53.842
Elliot, Elsie, do you mind?

47:57.281 --> 47:58.647
So, anyway,
you get the picture.

47:58.649 --> 48:00.615
To have any chance
of finding the tree,

48:00.617 --> 48:03.552
we have to go to Monteverde and
steal that flippin' journal.

48:03.554 --> 48:05.454
Steal the journal?

48:05.456 --> 48:06.621
Did I say that?

48:06.623 --> 48:08.490
Well, what's the worst
that can happen?

48:12.763 --> 48:15.363
Don't worry.
I know an omen when I see one,

48:15.365 --> 48:17.666
and that was not an omen.

48:18.837 --> 48:21.871
Stealing the journal
is not a big deal.

48:23.908 --> 48:25.908
In fact,

48:25.910 --> 48:29.411
Monteverde itself
is not a big deal.

48:31.415 --> 48:35.084
<i>The stop at Monteverde
was a very big deal.</i>

48:35.086 --> 48:38.421
<i>After all, this island
of bandits and thieves</i>

48:38.423 --> 48:41.557
<i>was once a place Dolittle,
Lily and I called home.</i>

48:41.559 --> 48:43.826
<i>Until the doctor</i>

48:43.828 --> 48:48.831
<i>made an enemy of the island's
notorious ruler, King Rassouli.</i>

48:48.833 --> 48:51.801
<i>And just our luck...
his most prized possession</i>

48:51.803 --> 48:54.604
<i>was the very journal
we needed to steal.</i>

48:56.541 --> 48:58.908
<i>So Dolittle needed a disguise.</i>

49:04.482 --> 49:07.818
<i>While I was left watching
over the rest of the crew,</i>

49:07.820 --> 49:11.556
<i>Dolittle and Stubbins
snuck into the palace.</i>

49:15.593 --> 49:17.694
I'm about to die!

49:20.566 --> 49:22.666
<i>Once inside, their path ended</i>

49:22.668 --> 49:25.402
<i>at a heavily bolted door,
naturally.</i>

49:25.404 --> 49:27.471
<i>But Dolittle still had</i>

49:27.473 --> 49:30.507
<i>questionable contacts
on the island.</i>

49:30.509 --> 49:31.575
Hut, hut, hut,

49:31.577 --> 49:33.644
hut, hut, hut, hut, hut, hut...

49:33.646 --> 49:35.612
The opening bid will suffice.

49:35.614 --> 49:37.447
You have my attention.

49:37.449 --> 49:38.749
Don Carpenterino,

49:38.751 --> 49:40.918
I'm here on behalf
of these humans.

49:40.920 --> 49:42.719
They will pay you handsomely

49:42.721 --> 49:44.989
for your family's
lock-picking skills.

49:44.991 --> 49:46.857
You come to me for this,

49:46.859 --> 49:49.426
on the day of
my daughter's wedding?

49:49.428 --> 49:51.428
Wait a minute.
Which daughter?

49:51.430 --> 49:53.430
It's not... Sh-Sheila?

49:53.432 --> 49:56.533
My Sheila?
She's getting married?

49:56.535 --> 49:59.469
- To a scorpion named Dylan.
- Sorry, Boy Scout.

49:59.471 --> 50:01.505
I guess Sheila's
into bad boys now.

50:03.409 --> 50:05.777
We were gonna spend the rest
of our life spans together.

50:05.779 --> 50:07.444
Move on, James.

50:07.446 --> 50:09.747
What's your human's best offer?

50:09.749 --> 50:11.482
Two more now...

50:11.484 --> 50:13.418
and two later. Huh?

50:13.420 --> 50:15.653
Okay.
You have yourself a deal.

50:15.655 --> 50:17.889
See you around, Boy Scout.

50:17.891 --> 50:19.791
Guys, I'm no Boy Scout.

50:19.793 --> 50:23.561
Also, what's a scorpion got
that I don't got?

50:23.563 --> 50:25.864
- Besides a massive stinger.
- Get over her, James.

50:25.866 --> 50:27.732
You dated for two weeks.

50:35.009 --> 50:36.843
These bars are new.

50:37.912 --> 50:39.544
Totally messing up my plan.

50:39.546 --> 50:40.812
I can fit through them.

50:40.814 --> 50:42.647
No, no, no.
It's too dangerous, man.

50:42.649 --> 50:45.650
Can't go in there on your own.

50:45.652 --> 50:47.686
Let me take him in, Doc.

50:47.688 --> 50:49.989
I need something to distract me
from this Sheila reveal.

50:49.991 --> 50:52.725
Are you sure your head's
in the right place, James?

50:52.727 --> 50:54.593
Oh, yeah.
I'll get the kid in

50:54.595 --> 50:56.228
and then fly headfirst
into a brick.

50:56.230 --> 50:58.497
Just kidding. I'm fine.

50:58.499 --> 51:00.532
Aye. All right.

51:00.534 --> 51:01.901
James will look after you.
It's fine.

51:01.903 --> 51:03.702
Listen closely.

51:03.704 --> 51:05.604
Get the journal
and get out of there.

51:05.606 --> 51:06.872
<i>Go through the room quietly.</i>

51:06.874 --> 51:08.507
<i>Look for the tiger's eye.</i>

51:08.509 --> 51:09.808
<i>Go down the hidden staircase.</i>

51:09.810 --> 51:12.978
<i>And most importantly,
keep your disguise on.</i>

51:12.980 --> 51:15.748
There's just one
little thing you should know.

51:15.750 --> 51:17.983
Rassouli loves his cats.

51:20.855 --> 51:23.957
But that's no problem for us,

51:23.959 --> 51:26.792
'cause we can just fly
right over... Wait.

51:26.794 --> 51:28.761
Uh, I see the mistake
I made here.

51:28.763 --> 51:30.562
You can't fly.

51:38.073 --> 51:40.073
Hey. Oh. Watch out.
Kitty cat on your six.

51:41.076 --> 51:42.909
Oh, God.

51:42.911 --> 51:44.010
Oh, oh! Whoa, whoa!

51:44.012 --> 51:45.712
Hey!

51:45.714 --> 51:47.547
Slick move, kid.

51:48.817 --> 51:51.284
We make a pretty good team.

51:51.286 --> 51:53.987
A real couple of bad boys.

51:53.989 --> 51:57.524
Okay, partner,
you know where to go.

52:19.148 --> 52:21.082
I'll keep watch on these lions.

52:21.084 --> 52:23.317
That's what a bad boy
dragonfly does.

52:23.319 --> 52:26.687
Would Dylan get
this close to a lion?

52:26.689 --> 52:28.756
Would he get this close?

52:28.758 --> 52:30.324
How about this close?

52:30.326 --> 52:32.893
Oh, sh...

52:32.895 --> 52:36.699
This is bad.
This is... very bad.

52:39.869 --> 52:41.637
"Lily...

52:42.705 --> 52:44.107
Dolittle."

52:52.182 --> 52:53.814
We got the journal! Open up!

52:53.816 --> 52:54.982
Just kidding. He blew it.

52:54.984 --> 52:56.018
- Bye!
- Oh, dear.

52:56.020 --> 52:57.785
Stubbins.

53:01.691 --> 53:03.091
Former resident here.

53:03.093 --> 53:04.926
- Don't move.
- Huh?

53:04.928 --> 53:06.194
Don't touch.

53:11.368 --> 53:14.803
All I wanted was my daughter
to marry wisely,

53:14.805 --> 53:18.740
and instead, I got
the ringleader of a circus.

53:18.742 --> 53:22.044
I never understood
what Lily saw in you.

53:22.046 --> 53:24.813
A common complaint
the world over

53:24.815 --> 53:27.082
for fathers
of beloved daughters,

53:27.084 --> 53:30.819
but in this instance,
I think we can all agree

53:30.821 --> 53:34.056
it is particularly accurate.

53:37.828 --> 53:39.628
Come here.

53:41.832 --> 53:43.099
Come here. Come here.

53:43.101 --> 53:45.234
Um, so,
you didn't mean any of that.

53:45.236 --> 53:48.171
It was her journal.

53:48.173 --> 53:52.208
The only thing of hers
my men found in the wreckage.

53:52.210 --> 53:55.646
It belongs here.

53:57.782 --> 54:02.218
All you had to do was
never show your face again

54:02.220 --> 54:04.120
and even at that...

54:04.122 --> 54:06.222
you failed.

54:06.224 --> 54:10.728
Now you'll pay
for taking Lily away from me.

54:12.197 --> 54:16.732
You knew what would happen
if you returned.

54:16.734 --> 54:18.435
Yes.

54:21.739 --> 54:23.739
Barry! Barry!

54:23.741 --> 54:27.177
Barry! Barry! Barry!

54:27.179 --> 54:31.215
Barry! Barry!
Barry! Barry!

54:31.217 --> 54:32.982
You should go.

54:32.984 --> 54:35.252
Come on, Barry!

54:35.254 --> 54:37.955
It's my past that's caught up
with me, not yours.

54:37.957 --> 54:40.057
- Yeah?
- But you're my friend.

54:40.059 --> 54:41.961
Go. Don't look back.

54:49.168 --> 54:52.769
You're better off
without him, kid.

54:52.771 --> 54:55.906
Um... I'm in compliance.

54:55.908 --> 54:57.908
Yes!

54:57.910 --> 54:59.309
Finally, some action down here.

54:59.311 --> 55:02.045
Boy, was it getting boring.
You know, Doc,

55:02.047 --> 55:04.848
I hate to tell you, but you're
going down, my friend.

55:04.850 --> 55:06.817
You'd do well to keep
your buckteeth together.

55:06.819 --> 55:07.985
What is that smell?

55:07.987 --> 55:10.255
Hey, fellas,
I think Dr. Dolittle

55:10.257 --> 55:12.789
did a little doo-doo.

55:12.791 --> 55:14.758
Did Dr. Dolittle do
a little doo-doo?

55:14.760 --> 55:17.495
Perhaps when I'm out of here,
I'll teach you some manners

55:17.497 --> 55:20.064
and accept your lucky foot
as payment.

55:20.066 --> 55:21.865
Oh, this lucky foot?

55:21.867 --> 55:24.169
Don't worry about it, Doc,
'cause both of my lucky feet

55:24.171 --> 55:26.070
are gonna be tap-dancing
on your grave

55:26.072 --> 55:27.804
when my guy's done with you.

55:27.806 --> 55:30.308
Taking bets over here.

55:30.310 --> 55:33.044
In the right corner,
wearing golden stripes,

55:33.046 --> 55:36.814
with a sparkling record
of 872 kills,

55:36.816 --> 55:41.753
Barry "The Butcher" Bernstein!

55:47.127 --> 55:50.128
Dr. Dolittle, remember me,

55:50.130 --> 55:52.130
your old patient?

55:52.132 --> 55:54.333
It's Barry.

55:54.335 --> 55:55.967
Barry.

55:55.969 --> 55:57.536
How could I forget you?

55:57.538 --> 56:00.004
Oh, but you did, Doc.

56:00.006 --> 56:02.807
We were just starting
to make progress,

56:02.809 --> 56:06.111
and then you run off
with Rassouli's daughter

56:06.113 --> 56:07.845
and abandon me.

56:07.847 --> 56:10.049
Well, uh, I'm back now.

56:10.051 --> 56:12.251
Uh, perhaps we should just
pick up where we left off...

56:14.788 --> 56:16.055
Enjoy the feast.

56:19.393 --> 56:22.127
What will happen to Dolittle?

56:22.129 --> 56:24.863
Oh. Well, he's a dead man.

56:24.865 --> 56:26.565
Yeah.

56:26.567 --> 56:29.902
He'll think he can talk
his way out of it, but, uh,

56:29.904 --> 56:33.205
Barry has gone completely nuts.

56:33.207 --> 56:37.943
But you...
you are one of us now.

56:37.945 --> 56:40.848
To Dolittle's death!

56:45.287 --> 56:47.989
- Psst.
- Hey, it's you.

56:49.224 --> 56:50.290
You made it.

56:50.292 --> 56:51.957
I need you to get a message

56:51.959 --> 56:53.126
to my friends on our boat.

56:53.128 --> 56:54.927
A message? Sure.

56:54.929 --> 56:57.297
When have I ever let you down?

56:57.299 --> 56:59.933
All I hear day after day is:

56:59.935 --> 57:03.303
"Oh, Barry,
you're such a disappointment.

57:03.305 --> 57:05.238
"Why can't you be
more like your brother?

57:05.240 --> 57:07.907
He eats poachers
for a living, you know."

57:07.909 --> 57:11.111
"Yes, Mother, I know!

57:11.113 --> 57:13.782
The whole jungle knows."

57:14.883 --> 57:15.949
Oh, my head.

57:15.951 --> 57:17.984
Your migraines are brought on

57:17.986 --> 57:19.986
by severe maternal issues

57:19.988 --> 57:21.388
and compounded
by sibling rivalry.

57:21.390 --> 57:24.924
Please make it stop.

57:24.926 --> 57:25.992
Oh, no, no, no, no.

57:25.994 --> 57:28.028
- Lie down.
- Oh, my head.

57:28.030 --> 57:31.998
We could resume your treatment.

57:32.000 --> 57:34.134
Oh, the stress is unbearable.

57:34.136 --> 57:37.204
I... I just want
to be a good boy.

57:37.206 --> 57:40.073
I just want
to make Mummy proud.

57:40.075 --> 57:41.342
There we are.

57:41.344 --> 57:45.012
No one I eat
will ever be good enough.

57:45.014 --> 57:47.914
There's the release.
Release it.

57:47.916 --> 57:51.052
I will never be good enough.

57:51.054 --> 57:53.954
Unless I eat you.

57:56.926 --> 57:58.092
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:58.094 --> 58:01.095
Because every mother
wants their son

58:01.097 --> 58:03.665
to grow up and eat a doctor.

58:03.667 --> 58:05.232
You're a sick kitty.

58:10.173 --> 58:12.106
Come here, Doc.
I'll make it quick.

58:12.108 --> 58:15.111
I've got another
one of these in an hour.

58:16.447 --> 58:18.245
Give up, Dolittle.

58:18.247 --> 58:19.514
You can't outsmart...

58:19.516 --> 58:21.015
Oh, what was that?

58:21.017 --> 58:22.183
Oh, wait.

58:22.185 --> 58:23.385
Now it's over there, huh?

58:23.387 --> 58:25.119
And now it's over here.

58:25.121 --> 58:27.054
Now it's back over there.
Got it.

58:27.056 --> 58:28.490
And now it's over here.

58:28.492 --> 58:30.392
Oh, I lost it.
I've got to get it.

58:30.394 --> 58:32.127
A cat is still a cat.

58:32.129 --> 58:34.131
- I got it.
- Easily distracted.

58:35.265 --> 58:37.065
New game, Doc.

58:37.067 --> 58:39.368
Get back down here.

58:39.370 --> 58:41.169
Come on down, Doc.

58:42.506 --> 58:45.006
Okay, James,
you can't let this kid down.

58:45.008 --> 58:46.441
You got to deliver
this message.

58:46.443 --> 58:48.711
Oh, no. It's James.

58:48.713 --> 58:53.115
From now on, no more focusing
on relationships and...

58:53.117 --> 58:55.083
Whoa. Poly?

58:55.085 --> 58:56.552
- Is that you?
- James?

58:56.554 --> 58:59.555
- Ooh, your feathers really filled out nice.
- James, James!

58:59.557 --> 59:02.057
- What happened, James?
- Oh, right. Message.

59:02.059 --> 59:03.325
My bad.

59:03.327 --> 59:05.060
The kid's been captured
by Rassouli,

59:05.062 --> 59:07.195
and Barry's about to have
Dolittle for lunch.

59:07.197 --> 59:09.197
Looks like we're going ashore
after all.

59:09.199 --> 59:11.501
Be a darling and grab
my dynamite, will you?

59:14.037 --> 59:17.540
We need to split up if
we're going to pull this off.

59:17.542 --> 59:19.409
Chee-Chee,
you're coming with me.

59:19.411 --> 59:21.411
Where are we going?
No, no, no, don't tell me.

59:21.413 --> 59:23.112
Just tell me when we get there.

59:23.114 --> 59:26.115
<i>Yoshi, create a distraction.</i>

59:26.117 --> 59:27.952
Hope this is enough.

59:33.458 --> 59:35.026
We are being attacked!

59:41.299 --> 59:43.166
Come on down, Doc.

59:43.168 --> 59:44.434
Therapy's the answer.

59:44.436 --> 59:46.770
Oh, no.
Worse than I expected.

59:51.042 --> 59:54.143
- I got you, Doc.
- Back off, Barry!

59:54.145 --> 59:56.346
Poly, don't!

59:56.348 --> 59:58.181
An appetizer.

1:00:00.619 --> 1:00:01.785
I got you, Poly.

1:00:05.191 --> 1:00:07.157
Any final diagnosis, Doc?

1:00:07.159 --> 1:00:09.193
Don't you want to be
the best Barry you could be?

1:00:09.195 --> 1:00:12.095
Oh, I'm about to.

1:00:12.097 --> 1:00:14.467
I am not a prisoner of fear!

1:00:18.237 --> 1:00:20.204
I'm not a prisoner of fear?

1:00:20.206 --> 1:00:21.505
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:21.507 --> 1:00:23.340
It's okay to be scared.

1:00:23.342 --> 1:00:25.142
- Ow, ow.
- Oh, oh!

1:00:28.481 --> 1:00:30.247
It's okay to be scared.

1:00:30.249 --> 1:00:32.182
- You should be scared.
- It's okay to be scared!

1:00:34.186 --> 1:00:36.488
- Give him a good hiding.
- Okay, we're doing this.

1:00:36.490 --> 1:00:38.322
We are doing this.

1:00:38.324 --> 1:00:40.257
We're not doing this.

1:00:43.563 --> 1:00:46.397
Hit him in the low area.

1:00:46.399 --> 1:00:49.099
Down there.

1:00:49.101 --> 1:00:50.170
Ah.

1:00:53.540 --> 1:00:55.540
Ooh, that's got to hurt.

1:00:55.542 --> 1:00:57.141
Ow! My Barry berries.

1:00:57.143 --> 1:00:58.142
That will work.

1:01:00.113 --> 1:01:01.346
Cheap shot, ape.

1:01:04.284 --> 1:01:06.351
Wait. I...

1:01:06.353 --> 1:01:10.121
I haven't finished
my treatment.

1:01:11.658 --> 1:01:14.359
♪ Go to sleep, baby tiger ♪

1:01:14.361 --> 1:01:17.328
♪ Time to put
those claws away. ♪

1:01:18.431 --> 1:01:20.166
Anyway...

1:01:21.268 --> 1:01:23.636
You need this more than I do.

1:01:23.638 --> 1:01:26.672
Tell me I'm enough, Mummy.

1:01:26.674 --> 1:01:29.475
I had 50 grand riding on that.

1:01:29.477 --> 1:01:32.143
Well, I won't pay that.

1:01:32.145 --> 1:01:35.181
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

1:01:36.651 --> 1:01:39.120
Thanks for sticking
with me, Doc.

1:02:02.209 --> 1:02:03.275
I have it.

1:02:03.277 --> 1:02:05.681
- I have the j...
- Stop! - Halt!

1:02:08.517 --> 1:02:11.118
And now I'll have it.

1:02:13.455 --> 1:02:14.588
Hmm.

1:02:17.626 --> 1:02:20.225
She had such a sure hand.

1:02:20.227 --> 1:02:23.463
Exactly what
the doctor ordered.

1:02:27.636 --> 1:02:29.502
What did they offer you,
Mudfly,

1:02:29.504 --> 1:02:31.239
to murder the queen of England?

1:02:32.441 --> 1:02:34.441
Quite a few things, actually.

1:02:34.443 --> 1:02:35.709
Knighthood.

1:02:35.711 --> 1:02:37.444
Windward House.

1:02:37.446 --> 1:02:39.212
Chair of the Royal College.

1:02:39.214 --> 1:02:41.514
In no particular order.

1:02:41.516 --> 1:02:44.551
Oh, and the icing
on the madeleine

1:02:44.553 --> 1:02:47.520
will be the scientific
accolades that accrue

1:02:47.522 --> 1:02:50.691
from the proper study
of the Eden Tree.

1:02:50.693 --> 1:02:53.460
All thanks to Lily Dolittle.

1:02:53.462 --> 1:02:56.262
Actually, no,
that's still madeleine.

1:02:56.264 --> 1:03:01.303
The icing is knowing
that you know I won.

1:03:04.741 --> 1:03:08.976
Oh, and, Dolittle, I'm so sorry
for that hole in your boat.

1:03:08.978 --> 1:03:10.279
What hole?

1:03:20.289 --> 1:03:21.691
Abandon ship!
Everyone, overboard!

1:03:26.295 --> 1:03:28.462
Oh, not good.

1:03:33.569 --> 1:03:35.236
Don't look back.

1:03:36.572 --> 1:03:38.572
Help!

1:03:38.574 --> 1:03:40.443
I'm on it, Doc.

1:03:41.779 --> 1:03:43.812
I can't fly.

1:03:43.814 --> 1:03:46.215
And I can't swim.

1:03:50.319 --> 1:03:52.319
Got you, buddy.

1:03:52.321 --> 1:03:53.789
Plimpton,
I'm not losing you, bro.

1:03:53.791 --> 1:03:55.590
Step away from the light.

1:03:55.592 --> 1:03:56.825
There is no light.

1:03:56.827 --> 1:03:58.026
I'm alive.

1:03:58.028 --> 1:03:59.594
I'm alive.

1:03:59.596 --> 1:04:03.665
I'm alive,
thanks to you, Yoshi.

1:04:26.658 --> 1:04:29.359
You've always been so kind.

1:04:32.597 --> 1:04:35.430
It's difficult to say goodbye.

1:04:35.432 --> 1:04:38.468
Please don't say that.

1:04:38.470 --> 1:04:40.572
It's all right.

1:04:43.842 --> 1:04:46.342
You've done your best.

1:04:46.344 --> 1:04:48.513
Your queen is proud.

1:04:52.717 --> 1:04:55.520
Where are you, Dolittle?

1:04:57.489 --> 1:04:59.822
Hey, big bird, you doing okay?

1:04:59.824 --> 1:05:01.557
No.

1:05:01.559 --> 1:05:03.626
Nothing about me is okay.

1:05:03.628 --> 1:05:05.829
My father was right about me.

1:05:05.831 --> 1:05:07.931
I should have been an omelet.

1:05:07.933 --> 1:05:10.100
I know how you feel.

1:05:10.102 --> 1:05:13.603
My dad said he was going out
for a pack of seals one night

1:05:13.605 --> 1:05:16.106
and never came back.

1:05:16.108 --> 1:05:19.475
I guess we got something
in common after all, Plimpton.

1:05:19.477 --> 1:05:21.645
What is this feeling?

1:05:21.647 --> 1:05:25.582
I'm all warm and fuzzy inside.

1:05:25.584 --> 1:05:27.818
That's friendship, bro.

1:05:27.820 --> 1:05:29.353
Huh.

1:05:29.355 --> 1:05:31.855
Not bad... bro.

1:05:35.528 --> 1:05:37.828
I'm not crying. You're crying.

1:05:51.844 --> 1:05:53.777
Right.
Gather round, shall we?

1:05:53.779 --> 1:05:56.446
Huh? Let's have a look
where we are now.

1:05:56.448 --> 1:05:58.317
That's the spirit, John.

1:06:01.922 --> 1:06:04.758
Oh, this is gonna be good.

1:06:06.660 --> 1:06:07.727
I'm already getting duck bumps.

1:06:10.964 --> 1:06:13.498
- We are finished.
- What?

1:06:13.500 --> 1:06:14.599
Is this a pep talk?

1:06:14.601 --> 1:06:15.867
'Cause it's a weird one.

1:06:15.869 --> 1:06:19.470
I can sniff defeat
like a truffle pig.

1:06:19.472 --> 1:06:21.472
This can't be the end.

1:06:21.474 --> 1:06:22.941
- Yeah.
- We...

1:06:22.943 --> 1:06:24.943
- I smell it.
- We can still save the queen.

1:06:24.945 --> 1:06:26.778
- Nope.
- We can still save your house.

1:06:29.482 --> 1:06:31.482
I believe in you.

1:06:31.484 --> 1:06:32.750
We can keep going.

1:06:32.752 --> 1:06:34.485
Oh, you got a point there.

1:06:34.487 --> 1:06:35.720
Except the journal's gone,

1:06:35.722 --> 1:06:37.789
we have no way to find
the Eden Tree,

1:06:37.791 --> 1:06:39.024
and our boat is sunk.

1:06:39.026 --> 1:06:40.895
He makes a strong argument.

1:06:42.729 --> 1:06:45.663
On the plus side,
you are all cured.

1:06:45.665 --> 1:06:47.565
Chee-Chee, you are brave now.

1:06:47.567 --> 1:06:49.869
Plimpton and Yoshi
are getting along.

1:06:49.871 --> 1:06:51.770
Ow! Remember, back! Back!

1:06:51.772 --> 1:06:52.972
Sort of.

1:06:52.974 --> 1:06:54.773
And, Stubbins,
you've made friends,

1:06:54.775 --> 1:06:56.642
and you can even talk to 'em.

1:06:56.644 --> 1:06:58.443
You don't need me.

1:06:58.445 --> 1:07:00.813
I'll stay here
and offer medical services

1:07:00.815 --> 1:07:03.649
to this island
of random bandits and outlaws.

1:07:03.651 --> 1:07:04.917
The doctor's here!

1:07:04.919 --> 1:07:06.619
Seeking new patients.

1:07:06.621 --> 1:07:08.520
- Cash only.
- Ladies, gentlemen,

1:07:08.522 --> 1:07:10.223
who'd like to dance?

1:07:10.225 --> 1:07:12.691
I got a bad case
of dancing fever.

1:07:12.693 --> 1:07:14.793
So, watch out, it's infectious.

1:07:14.795 --> 1:07:16.462
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!

1:07:16.464 --> 1:07:17.963
- Come on, Doc.
- Can't help him.

1:07:17.965 --> 1:07:19.932
That explorer
you told me about...

1:07:19.934 --> 1:07:21.800
she would have never given up.

1:07:21.802 --> 1:07:23.769
She was your wife, wasn't she?

1:07:23.771 --> 1:07:25.571
You want to know
the ironic bit?

1:07:25.573 --> 1:07:29.475
I don't know
what "ironic" means.

1:07:29.477 --> 1:07:32.779
Irony is when you find a woman

1:07:32.781 --> 1:07:34.080
and she makes your life
more wonderful

1:07:34.082 --> 1:07:35.882
than it had any right to be,

1:07:35.884 --> 1:07:39.518
and then, poof, she's gone,
and it's all your fault.

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:43.558
This journey was my chance
to finish what she started.

1:07:46.528 --> 1:07:48.962
Lily insisted I care
for the animals at home,

1:07:48.964 --> 1:07:51.498
so I stayed behind.

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:53.066
Rassouli's right.

1:07:53.068 --> 1:07:54.801
I should have been with her.

1:07:54.803 --> 1:07:57.704
Now all I have left of her
is the ghost I see

1:07:57.706 --> 1:07:59.572
when I hold our rings.

1:07:59.574 --> 1:08:01.743
So, you see her, too?

1:08:05.013 --> 1:08:08.982
Not only did you lose
my daughter's journal...

1:08:10.719 --> 1:08:13.853
...but your polar bear
blew up my village.

1:08:13.855 --> 1:08:14.956
No.

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:16.991
We don't know that.

1:08:16.993 --> 1:08:21.561
And your gorilla
beat up my tiger.

1:08:21.563 --> 1:08:23.066
No good.

1:08:26.869 --> 1:08:29.570
- Let's go.
- No, no. Stay.

1:08:29.572 --> 1:08:30.773
No, no, no, no, no.

1:08:31.941 --> 1:08:34.777
Mm. Yeah.

1:08:39.983 --> 1:08:42.616
Irony...

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:46.053
is me wanting to kill you

1:08:46.055 --> 1:08:49.092
with every fiber of my being...

1:08:52.028 --> 1:08:56.666
...but loving my daughter more.

1:09:06.010 --> 1:09:07.845
I miss her, too.

1:09:10.914 --> 1:09:13.782
She would have wanted you to...

1:09:13.784 --> 1:09:15.619
to keep going.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:25.796
So!

1:09:28.032 --> 1:09:30.366
Get going...

1:09:30.368 --> 1:09:32.734
before I stop feeling
sentimental.

1:09:36.807 --> 1:09:38.809
She's saying
we don't have a ship.

1:09:40.044 --> 1:09:42.111
Well, uh...

1:09:42.113 --> 1:09:44.882
I have the perfect vessel
for you.

1:09:47.684 --> 1:09:49.152
Bit of a fixer-upper.

1:09:49.154 --> 1:09:51.220
It's got good bones.

1:09:51.222 --> 1:09:52.288
At least it floats.

1:09:52.290 --> 1:09:55.958
We'll just have to make
the best of it, won't we?

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:58.027
Ooh! Company.

1:09:58.029 --> 1:10:00.029
Uh, who's that?

1:10:00.031 --> 1:10:01.397
Hi.

1:10:01.399 --> 1:10:02.732
I'm Jeff.

1:10:02.734 --> 1:10:04.903
Crikey.

1:10:07.038 --> 1:10:09.839
<i>If Lily's research was correct,</i>

1:10:09.841 --> 1:10:13.943
<i>then Mudfly was well on his way
to Eden Tree Island.</i>

1:10:13.945 --> 1:10:16.979
<i>All we needed to do
was track Mudfly.</i>

1:10:16.981 --> 1:10:18.815
But how do we do that?

1:10:18.817 --> 1:10:21.017
Whales, boyo.

1:10:21.019 --> 1:10:22.987
Whales.

1:10:39.138 --> 1:10:41.171
I can't believe
you're flipping him off.

1:10:41.173 --> 1:10:43.741
I know.
That man has no chin.

1:10:53.152 --> 1:10:54.753
Ah.

1:11:12.004 --> 1:11:14.874
We found him. Follow us.

1:11:24.050 --> 1:11:26.253
Eden Tree Island.

1:11:43.503 --> 1:11:45.303
- Yeah!
- Oh, wow.

1:11:45.305 --> 1:11:49.007
- Wow.
- Extraordinary.

1:12:03.056 --> 1:12:04.956
This must be it.

1:12:04.958 --> 1:12:10.262
The map points us directly into
the center of this mountain.

1:12:10.264 --> 1:12:12.131
Don't look down.

1:12:12.133 --> 1:12:14.200
Let's keep our beaks up,
shall we?

1:12:14.202 --> 1:12:15.767
Trying to stay positive.

1:12:15.769 --> 1:12:17.203
What the heck
are we doing up here?

1:12:17.205 --> 1:12:20.072
Going in the back way,
my feathered buddy.

1:12:20.074 --> 1:12:21.840
What are you complaining about?

1:12:21.842 --> 1:12:23.976
This is the widest branch
I've ever scurried on.

1:12:23.978 --> 1:12:25.277
Don't look down.

1:12:25.279 --> 1:12:27.079
Look at me.

1:12:27.081 --> 1:12:29.081
Whoa.

1:12:29.083 --> 1:12:31.719
A big cave.

1:12:36.257 --> 1:12:38.023
Stay close. Keep quiet.

1:12:38.025 --> 1:12:39.825
Kevin's log, day 12.

1:12:39.827 --> 1:12:41.260
Some force
beyond my comprehension

1:12:41.262 --> 1:12:44.129
still compels me to follow
this crew of lunatics,

1:12:44.131 --> 1:12:46.865
the squirrel killer
and their deranged leader.

1:12:46.867 --> 1:12:49.369
Perhaps it's the magic tree
that draws me.

1:12:49.371 --> 1:12:51.271
- Rifle troop! Fall in!
- Hide. They're close.

1:12:51.273 --> 1:12:54.041
Turn it down now. Stay down.

1:13:04.386 --> 1:13:06.855
Fox fire fungus.

1:13:07.923 --> 1:13:09.825
We must be near it now.

1:13:12.294 --> 1:13:14.294
Look, Doc.

1:13:14.296 --> 1:13:16.363
It's lighting a path
all the way...

1:13:16.365 --> 1:13:18.898
to the man who wants us dead.

1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:20.900
Stay right there.

1:13:20.902 --> 1:13:22.836
Oh.

1:13:22.838 --> 1:13:25.071
Go on, then, soldier boy.
Spoil yourself.

1:13:29.878 --> 1:13:32.178
Hello, Blair.

1:13:34.049 --> 1:13:35.249
Get over there!

1:13:35.251 --> 1:13:37.152
Looking for a tree, is it?

1:13:38.421 --> 1:13:41.188
Trees don't often grow
in caves.

1:13:41.190 --> 1:13:42.956
Didn't you pay attention
in botany class?

1:13:42.958 --> 1:13:46.062
No, but pay attention
to this, Dolittle.

1:13:47.330 --> 1:13:49.930
I beat you.

1:13:49.932 --> 1:13:53.067
You filthy animal...

1:13:53.069 --> 1:13:54.468
Move it. Come on, beasts.

1:13:54.470 --> 1:13:56.973
...hoarder!

1:13:59.208 --> 1:14:01.175
So...

1:14:01.177 --> 1:14:02.910
where is it?

1:14:02.912 --> 1:14:04.245
Where's what?

1:14:05.415 --> 1:14:07.081
The Eden Tree.

1:14:07.083 --> 1:14:10.351
Truth is, I haven't got a clue.

1:14:10.353 --> 1:14:11.886
Don't be ridiculous.

1:14:11.888 --> 1:14:13.287
You're John Dolittle.

1:14:13.289 --> 1:14:15.890
You get everything you want.

1:14:15.892 --> 1:14:17.361
Not today, I don't.

1:14:19.062 --> 1:14:22.196
You really don't have
any idea, do you?

1:14:22.198 --> 1:14:25.367
How does ignorance feel?

1:14:25.369 --> 1:14:27.369
Oh.

1:14:27.371 --> 1:14:29.970
Well, very freeing, actually.

1:14:29.972 --> 1:14:33.108
One must hug uncertainty,
don't you think?

1:14:33.110 --> 1:14:35.377
That's how Lily lived her life.

1:14:37.481 --> 1:14:39.214
Embrace the unknown, and...

1:14:39.216 --> 1:14:42.117
the answers will be revealed.

1:14:42.119 --> 1:14:46.221
You sad, misguided nut,
Dolittle.

1:14:46.223 --> 1:14:47.858
Give that to me.
Give me that.

1:14:50.461 --> 1:14:54.096
I will find this damn tree
on my own,

1:14:54.098 --> 1:14:58.133
and by God,
history will remember me.

1:15:09.179 --> 1:15:12.281
Yeah. Something interesting
going on now.

1:15:17.522 --> 1:15:21.023
My God, that feels
a lot larger than all of us.

1:15:23.194 --> 1:15:25.161
Let's go!

1:15:25.163 --> 1:15:27.296
- What is that?
- Something's moving!

1:15:28.366 --> 1:15:29.968
Look out!

1:15:34.139 --> 1:15:37.173
Retreat!

1:15:37.175 --> 1:15:38.742
Down over here!

1:15:38.744 --> 1:15:41.177
The lot of you! Come on!

1:15:41.179 --> 1:15:43.281
Yoshi, stay down.

1:15:44.382 --> 1:15:45.982
He saved me.

1:15:45.984 --> 1:15:48.050
I have a second chance

1:15:48.052 --> 1:15:52.356
to live a life of-of kindness
and-and-and generosity and...

1:15:57.363 --> 1:15:59.095
Take him, not me!

1:15:59.097 --> 1:16:01.231
I'm a good person now.

1:16:25.324 --> 1:16:27.324
Tell you what we're gonna do...
we're gonna make a run

1:16:27.326 --> 1:16:28.392
for that ditch
while she's distracted...

1:16:30.362 --> 1:16:32.062
- Yoshi!
- Get this off of me!

1:16:32.064 --> 1:16:33.096
Cheech.

1:16:33.098 --> 1:16:34.599
Help me! Plimpton!

1:16:34.601 --> 1:16:36.300
I'll save you, bro.

1:16:36.302 --> 1:16:38.168
Right. Think fast. Uh...

1:16:38.170 --> 1:16:41.106
Get this off of me!

1:16:42.642 --> 1:16:44.411
This will likely
upset her a bit.

1:16:46.379 --> 1:16:48.045
No! Doc!

1:16:48.047 --> 1:16:49.581
- No! - No!
- John!

1:16:49.583 --> 1:16:52.219
Dolittle!

1:17:05.365 --> 1:17:06.397
Dolittle!

1:17:06.399 --> 1:17:07.665
Help!

1:17:19.246 --> 1:17:21.379
Is he speaking dragon?

1:17:23.383 --> 1:17:28.387
You may be able
to speak my language,

1:17:28.389 --> 1:17:32.691
but that does not make you
worthy of the fruit.

1:17:32.693 --> 1:17:35.361
I know protecting the tree's
your duty,

1:17:35.363 --> 1:17:38.264
but you won't be able
to continue much longer...

1:17:38.266 --> 1:17:39.698
considering
the damage you've taken

1:17:39.700 --> 1:17:41.400
and the pain you're in.

1:17:41.402 --> 1:17:46.539
Oh, you know
nothing of my pain.

1:17:51.245 --> 1:17:53.345
But I do.

1:17:53.347 --> 1:17:55.481
I've felt it as well.

1:17:55.483 --> 1:17:58.384
The kind that doesn't come
from a bullet or a blade,

1:17:58.386 --> 1:18:00.121
but cuts much deeper.

1:18:01.455 --> 1:18:04.323
And now in every moment
and every movement,

1:18:04.325 --> 1:18:06.325
you feel that pain again.

1:18:06.327 --> 1:18:08.394
Yeah?

1:18:11.567 --> 1:18:14.133
It's hard to carry on...

1:18:18.540 --> 1:18:21.208
...when you've lost
the one you love.

1:18:35.223 --> 1:18:38.360
Just leave!

1:18:45.334 --> 1:18:47.233
Uh, what just happened?

1:18:47.235 --> 1:18:48.703
Oh, broken hearts.

1:18:48.705 --> 1:18:50.370
What the heck
are you doing here?

1:18:50.372 --> 1:18:51.571
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

1:18:51.573 --> 1:18:53.306
We're both dragons.

1:18:53.308 --> 1:18:56.544
Hey, just wondering,
you know, dragon to dragon,

1:18:56.546 --> 1:18:58.244
if you wouldn't mind
telling me where...

1:18:58.246 --> 1:19:00.481
Ow, ow, ow!
She's really mad.

1:19:00.483 --> 1:19:02.783
I'll wait for
whoever survives outside.

1:19:02.785 --> 1:19:05.786
John, let's just get
out of here while we still can.

1:19:05.788 --> 1:19:07.488
No.

1:19:07.490 --> 1:19:09.323
I think we're here to help her.

1:19:11.661 --> 1:19:13.461
Yeah.

1:19:13.463 --> 1:19:15.630
- We haven't got much time.
- Hmm?

1:19:15.632 --> 1:19:18.766
I-I imagine
it's a bit tender here.

1:19:20.637 --> 1:19:22.269
Oh...

1:19:22.271 --> 1:19:24.672
I'm unarmed.

1:19:24.674 --> 1:19:27.274
I pose no threat to you.

1:19:27.276 --> 1:19:29.276
The emotional stress
over the years

1:19:29.278 --> 1:19:30.544
has done damage
to your stomach.

1:19:30.546 --> 1:19:32.546
Get away from me.

1:19:32.548 --> 1:19:35.383
You have a severe
impaction of the colon,

1:19:35.385 --> 1:19:38.319
and if I don't manually
fragment it, it'll go septic.

1:19:38.321 --> 1:19:41.322
You won't be able to protect
anything anymore.

1:19:41.324 --> 1:19:44.693
Ooh, that sounds like
some tummy ache.

1:19:44.695 --> 1:19:46.528
Tell you what,
give us five minutes.

1:19:46.530 --> 1:19:48.797
If you don't feel better,
you can fry us all.

1:19:48.799 --> 1:19:50.732
Stop talking.

1:19:50.734 --> 1:19:53.669
Just get on with it.

1:19:53.671 --> 1:19:56.471
We have to get you
on your side.

1:19:56.473 --> 1:19:58.707
We need to perform
an emergency extraction.

1:19:58.709 --> 1:20:00.742
Extraction?
Uh, what are we pulling out?

1:20:00.744 --> 1:20:03.445
- Go get 'em, gang.
- Got your back, Doc.

1:20:03.447 --> 1:20:05.580
It's showtime.

1:20:05.582 --> 1:20:07.649
Three, two, one.

1:20:07.651 --> 1:20:09.551
Turn.

1:20:11.022 --> 1:20:12.854
Chee-Chee,
chuck me the forceps.

1:20:12.856 --> 1:20:15.557
Knew it would come in handy.
Told you!

1:20:15.559 --> 1:20:16.859
Everybody knows what to do.

1:20:16.861 --> 1:20:18.660
Just breathe. Works for me.

1:20:18.662 --> 1:20:21.296
It's okay. Just hold on
to my wing, sweetie.

1:20:21.298 --> 1:20:22.464
Dab-Dab's here.

1:20:22.466 --> 1:20:23.498
Oi.

1:20:23.500 --> 1:20:24.566
You are my apprentice.

1:20:24.568 --> 1:20:26.303
You keep her calm.

1:20:28.305 --> 1:20:31.541
Did you know the leek is
the national emblem of Wales?

1:20:31.543 --> 1:20:33.341
And very useful it is, too.

1:20:33.343 --> 1:20:35.343
You might feel
a bit of pressure.

1:20:35.345 --> 1:20:37.347
I got her.

1:20:38.817 --> 1:20:40.450
Oh, good heavens!

1:20:40.452 --> 1:20:41.617
Oh, no, you didn't.

1:20:41.619 --> 1:20:43.486
Oh, my gosh!

1:20:43.488 --> 1:20:45.388
Just clearing the way.

1:20:45.390 --> 1:20:47.557
Is that armor?

1:20:47.559 --> 1:20:50.228
You got the whole
Spanish army in here.

1:20:51.763 --> 1:20:52.895
Give us a deep breath.

1:20:52.897 --> 1:20:54.430
Hold it.

1:20:54.432 --> 1:20:55.498
Word of warning.

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:56.599
What's up, Doc?

1:20:56.601 --> 1:20:58.367
When removing the blockage...

1:20:58.369 --> 1:20:59.736
Yoshi, now.

1:20:59.738 --> 1:21:02.805
...there may be an initial
release of wind.

1:21:09.547 --> 1:21:11.915
Ach-ah-vee!

1:21:11.917 --> 1:21:13.483
Respect.

1:21:13.485 --> 1:21:15.418
It's all right.
Nobody heard that.

1:21:15.420 --> 1:21:17.588
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1:21:17.590 --> 1:21:18.922
We all do it.

1:21:18.924 --> 1:21:21.091
We're all animals.

1:21:21.093 --> 1:21:23.093
I can taste it!

1:21:23.095 --> 1:21:24.695
- Okay, I'm back.
- Right.

1:21:24.697 --> 1:21:26.897
What did I miss? Oh, my gosh!

1:21:26.899 --> 1:21:28.699
This is the big one.

1:21:28.701 --> 1:21:30.400
We're in the homestretch now.

1:21:30.402 --> 1:21:31.535
Cheech, get behind me.

1:21:31.537 --> 1:21:32.870
I'm with you, Doc.
On your call.

1:21:32.872 --> 1:21:34.605
Heave!

1:21:36.776 --> 1:21:38.675
Oh, it's breaching.

1:21:38.677 --> 1:21:41.411
Blood rushing to my head.
Everything turning red.

1:21:41.413 --> 1:21:43.814
One last push, madam,
if you please.

1:21:56.595 --> 1:21:58.129
Thank you.

1:21:59.665 --> 1:22:00.765
We did it.

1:22:00.767 --> 1:22:02.432
Teamwork makes the dream work.

1:22:03.804 --> 1:22:06.671
That was a lot,
but we did good.

1:22:10.442 --> 1:22:11.943
To put it simply,

1:22:11.945 --> 1:22:15.547
more leafy greens
and less armor in your diet.

1:22:16.983 --> 1:22:21.920
I've seen armies of every kind,
but nothing like you.

1:22:21.922 --> 1:22:26.591
What unites
such a group of creatures?

1:22:26.593 --> 1:22:30.728
Well, we may not look it,
right, but somehow...

1:22:30.730 --> 1:22:33.598
- Who's a good boy? Good boy.
- ...we just belong together.

1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:36.903
Now let me help you.

1:22:54.421 --> 1:22:56.454
Lily would have loved it, John.

1:22:56.456 --> 1:22:58.724
We would never have found it
without her.

1:22:58.726 --> 1:23:03.364
Wow. I just got the chills,
and I'm not even cold.

1:23:27.655 --> 1:23:30.591
Thank you for showing me
the way, my love.

1:23:36.965 --> 1:23:38.765
We know, O Lord, that there is

1:23:38.767 --> 1:23:41.533
no word impossible to thee;

1:23:41.535 --> 1:23:45.705
and that, if thou wilst,
thou canst yet raise her up

1:23:45.707 --> 1:23:48.942
and restore her to a longer
continuance amongst us.

1:23:48.944 --> 1:23:51.778
O Father of mercies
and Lord of all comfort...

1:23:51.780 --> 1:23:54.681
I'm sorry we couldn't save you,
Your Majesty.

1:23:54.683 --> 1:23:57.019
...her disillusion
draweth near.

1:23:59.054 --> 1:24:01.621
It is with great sadness...

1:24:01.623 --> 1:24:02.989
Wait a minute.
I smell something.

1:24:02.991 --> 1:24:04.624
It smells like...

1:24:07.796 --> 1:24:08.662
Hope.

1:24:08.664 --> 1:24:10.597
...that I have to announce...

1:24:12.035 --> 1:24:13.867
...that the queen is no more.

1:24:13.869 --> 1:24:15.970
Somebody call a doctor?

1:24:15.972 --> 1:24:17.972
My mates!
A very dramatic entrance, boys.

1:24:17.974 --> 1:24:19.706
Well played.

1:24:19.708 --> 1:24:21.742
- We've arrived.
- Dolittle!

1:24:21.744 --> 1:24:23.711
Clear a path.
There isn't a moment to waste.

1:24:27.650 --> 1:24:30.818
I have procured that which
is said to not exist.

1:24:30.820 --> 1:24:33.690
Behold, the fruit
of the Eden Tree.

1:24:35.792 --> 1:24:38.025
I said clear a path.

1:24:38.027 --> 1:24:39.627
Seize them!

1:24:40.897 --> 1:24:42.964
Sorry but... sorry.

1:24:46.836 --> 1:24:48.871
I got him!

1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:52.740
- Go.
- Seize them!

1:24:53.977 --> 1:24:55.712
You were born for this moment.

1:24:56.746 --> 1:24:57.812
I born.

1:24:59.649 --> 1:25:01.116
Mini, take flight.

1:25:01.118 --> 1:25:02.918
Get him!

1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:03.952
Freeze!

1:25:03.954 --> 1:25:06.021
Go, go, go!

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:09.659
No.

1:25:11.862 --> 1:25:12.796
No, no, no, no!

1:25:55.006 --> 1:25:57.639
Kevin's log, day unknown.

1:25:57.641 --> 1:25:59.108
The killing has ended.

1:25:59.110 --> 1:26:00.943
Let there be life.

1:26:00.945 --> 1:26:02.814
Lady Rose.

1:26:05.083 --> 1:26:08.951
Is there a giraffe
in my bedchamber?

1:26:08.953 --> 1:26:10.686
Yes. Oh, yes.

1:26:10.688 --> 1:26:13.689
And a polar bear
and a gorilla and a parrot

1:26:13.691 --> 1:26:15.625
and a duck, an ostrich.

1:26:18.196 --> 1:26:22.698
Our humble thanks be to God.

1:26:22.700 --> 1:26:25.768
And well done, Dr. Dolittle.

1:26:25.770 --> 1:26:28.704
Not quite done, are we?

1:26:28.706 --> 1:26:31.208
Interesting.
Carry on, Styx. I'm all ears.

1:26:31.210 --> 1:26:33.177
What's that?

1:26:33.179 --> 1:26:35.678
Uh, Styx here agreed
to stay behind,

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:37.147
keep his 12 eyes on things.

1:26:37.149 --> 1:26:39.149
He's just catching me up.

1:26:39.151 --> 1:26:40.783
Like all leaf insects,

1:26:40.785 --> 1:26:42.986
he speaks in
eight-syllable phrases,

1:26:42.988 --> 1:26:45.655
and he states...

1:26:45.657 --> 1:26:48.125
"Lord Badgley
did poison the queen."

1:26:48.127 --> 1:26:49.960
What? He did?

1:26:49.962 --> 1:26:53.063
Really,
Dolittle, this is too much.

1:26:53.065 --> 1:26:54.098
You're certain?

1:26:54.100 --> 1:26:56.266
Well, this would be the time.

1:26:56.268 --> 1:27:00.170
No. I'm sorry.
Styx is quite adamant.

1:27:00.172 --> 1:27:04.241
"In his right pocket,
the vial."

1:27:04.243 --> 1:27:05.943
Ugh, that's only seven.

1:27:05.945 --> 1:27:07.911
Oh, "in his right pocket,

1:27:07.913 --> 1:27:09.880
the vial of
deathly nightshade."

1:27:09.882 --> 1:27:12.015
Let's have a look, shall we?

1:27:12.017 --> 1:27:13.750
You can't possibly believe

1:27:13.752 --> 1:27:16.987
that he's talking to an insect.

1:27:16.989 --> 1:27:18.755
Well, I've...

1:27:18.757 --> 1:27:21.159
I've spoken to ladybugs.

1:27:21.161 --> 1:27:23.962
Making a wish
before they fly away.

1:27:23.964 --> 1:27:25.762
Let's have a look.

1:27:28.767 --> 1:27:30.767
Ooh.

1:27:35.175 --> 1:27:36.908
No one messes with my family.

1:27:36.910 --> 1:27:39.277
Take one more step, and I'll
rip you a brand-new a...

1:27:39.279 --> 1:27:41.047
Come on.

1:27:42.315 --> 1:27:43.948
Get...

1:27:43.950 --> 1:27:45.218
Hah.

1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:48.786
To the Tower with him.

1:27:48.788 --> 1:27:51.990
Oh, someone's been a bad boy.

1:27:51.992 --> 1:27:53.791
Come on.

1:27:53.793 --> 1:27:56.027
And I don't know why
you're all standing there.

1:27:56.029 --> 1:27:58.163
Nobody's died.
Leave me in peace.

1:27:58.165 --> 1:27:59.964
You, too.

1:27:59.966 --> 1:28:01.233
Your Majesty.

1:28:02.236 --> 1:28:04.738
Not you, Dr. Dolittle.

1:28:05.839 --> 1:28:07.807
A moment, if you would, please.

1:28:10.044 --> 1:28:12.978
Lady Rose, who is this person,
and why is he staring at me?

1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:14.714
He's Stubbins.

1:28:15.983 --> 1:28:18.783
I-I want to be
an animal doctor.

1:28:18.785 --> 1:28:20.753
He saved your life.

1:28:32.233 --> 1:28:33.933
Thank you.

1:28:33.935 --> 1:28:35.803
It's good to have you back,
Doctor.

1:28:40.542 --> 1:28:41.474
Poly.

1:28:41.476 --> 1:28:44.043
Anything
you'd like to say to me?

1:28:44.045 --> 1:28:45.345
Aye, you were right.

1:28:45.347 --> 1:28:47.880
I suppose it is nice
to get out of the house

1:28:47.882 --> 1:28:49.148
every once in a while.

1:28:49.150 --> 1:28:50.783
Stubbins, Mini.

1:28:50.785 --> 1:28:53.852
Enough. We have far less
important places to be.

1:29:02.863 --> 1:29:05.999
<i>Our story ends
the way it began.</i>

1:29:06.001 --> 1:29:08.868
I have a letter
for Dr. Dolittle!

1:29:08.870 --> 1:29:10.036
Somebody get me down!

1:29:10.038 --> 1:29:11.304
<i>Mostly.</i>

1:29:11.306 --> 1:29:14.274
<i>There once was
a peculiar doctor...</i>

1:29:17.012 --> 1:29:20.280
<i>...who found he was
at his best when sharing</i>

1:29:20.282 --> 1:29:22.849
<i>his extraordinary ability...</i>

1:29:22.851 --> 1:29:25.185
- <i>...with others.</i>
- Excellent.

1:29:25.187 --> 1:29:28.356
<i>Soon, Dr. Dolittle
reopened his gates,</i>

1:29:28.358 --> 1:29:31.359
<i>as Lily would have wanted.</i>

1:29:31.361 --> 1:29:33.994
Three more in the queue, gang.

1:29:33.996 --> 1:29:36.162
Copy that.

1:29:36.164 --> 1:29:39.400
<i>Dolittle discovered his
place in the world once again.</i>

1:29:46.908 --> 1:29:50.177
<i>After all,
it's only by helping others</i>

1:29:50.179 --> 1:29:53.249
<i>that we can truly
help ourselves.</i>
