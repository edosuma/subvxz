01:55.546 --> 01:58.617
<i>The war tried
to kill us in the spring.</i>

02:00.519 --> 02:02.586
<i>And the summer.</i>

02:02.588 --> 02:04.924
<i>It tried to kill us every day.</i>

02:06.391 --> 02:08.524
<i>It didn't explain itself.</i>

02:08.526 --> 02:10.693
<i>It didn't tell us why
it brought us there</i>

02:10.696 --> 02:12.431
<i>or what it wanted.</i>

02:13.665 --> 02:15.098
<i>It just took.</i>

02:18.837 --> 02:23.573
<i>It killed some of us before
we knew we were dead.</i>

02:23.575 --> 02:25.509
<i>Pretty soon it was hard
to tell who was alive</i>

02:25.511 --> 02:27.647
<i>and who was just a ghost.</i>

02:30.482 --> 02:32.518
<i>We lost Murph
somewhere in there.</i>

02:34.018 --> 02:36.118
<i>Not really sure when.</i>

02:36.120 --> 02:39.091
<i>Even before we lost
him, he was gone.</i>

02:42.060 --> 02:44.897
<i>I wish the truth were different
than what I remembered.</i>

02:47.065 --> 02:50.036
<i>I wish I could find an
order that made sense.</i>

02:56.542 --> 02:58.575
Conceal and carry, baby.

02:58.577 --> 03:00.480
Conceal and carry.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.480
It's gonna take courage
to win this war.

03:04.482 --> 03:05.515
Definitely.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.659
She's into you, Murph.

03:16.661 --> 03:17.696
Nah.

03:19.998 --> 03:21.900
- You like her?
- No.

03:24.570 --> 03:26.072
Go dance with her.

03:27.538 --> 03:28.673
I can't.

03:30.174 --> 03:31.540
Whatever.

03:31.542 --> 03:32.742
I'm not a good dancer.

03:32.744 --> 03:34.243
So just dance.

03:34.245 --> 03:35.481
Hi!

03:37.649 --> 03:39.482
Hi! Where you going?

03:39.484 --> 03:41.651
Hi, sorry.

03:41.653 --> 03:43.587
He'll get to it.
He's shy.

03:43.589 --> 03:44.788
Yeah.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.522
You're embarrassing me.

03:46.524 --> 03:48.058
You're embarrassing
yourself, dude.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.058
Come on.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.226
Come on!

03:50.228 --> 03:51.594
Yeah, baby.

03:51.596 --> 03:52.661
Fucking move!

03:52.663 --> 03:54.630
Now move! Move!

03:54.632 --> 03:55.798
- Incoming!
- Move!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.166
Fucking move, go!

04:01.038 --> 04:02.708
Oh, shit!

04:03.774 --> 04:05.107
All right, let's go!

04:08.513 --> 04:09.548
Guys, guys...

04:18.656 --> 04:20.091
That was pretty close, huh?

04:22.694 --> 04:26.596
<i>Yellow
bird on a window sill.</i>

04:26.598 --> 04:29.965
<i>Yellow
bird on a window sill.</i>

04:29.967 --> 04:33.637
<i>Pretty little
beak and a pretty little tail.</i>

04:33.639 --> 04:34.904
<i>Pretty little beak</i>

04:34.906 --> 04:36.976
<i>and a pretty little tail.</i>

04:46.851 --> 04:48.787
<i>Check your racks.</i>

04:51.757 --> 04:53.657
<i>There you go, Morgan!</i>

04:53.659 --> 04:54.823
Hey, man.

04:54.825 --> 04:56.293
You from Virginia?

04:56.295 --> 04:57.726
I'm from Richmond.

04:57.728 --> 04:58.727
Well, just outside Richmond.

05:01.233 --> 05:02.698
My name's Murphy.

05:02.700 --> 05:03.969
Yeah, I know.

05:04.937 --> 05:06.602
Oh, yeah.

05:06.604 --> 05:08.137
Somebody told me
you're from Virginia.

05:08.139 --> 05:09.238
Really?

05:09.240 --> 05:10.276
Then why'd you ask?

05:11.243 --> 05:12.842
Privates.

05:12.844 --> 05:13.913
Get your asses up here.

05:18.050 --> 05:20.183
Now, you boys seriously
need to unfuck yourselves.

05:20.185 --> 05:21.585
You hear me?

05:21.587 --> 05:22.622
None of you people get it.

05:24.089 --> 05:26.255
Now, Murphy, show me something.

05:26.257 --> 05:28.960
<i>Firing mine, rapidly
quick.</i>

05:40.072 --> 05:41.307
Your turn, Private.

05:42.974 --> 05:44.042
Murphy.

05:46.243 --> 05:47.777
How tall are you?

05:47.779 --> 05:48.945
5'7".

05:48.947 --> 05:50.347
5'7" what?

05:50.349 --> 05:52.214
- Just 5'7".
- 5'7", Sergeant.

05:52.216 --> 05:54.851
5'7", Sergeant, sir.

05:54.853 --> 05:56.786
You fast?

05:56.788 --> 05:58.157
Yes, Sergeant.

06:00.158 --> 06:02.092
All right, little man.

06:02.094 --> 06:03.293
When the time comes I need
somebody to run for me,

06:03.295 --> 06:05.327
I'm gonna ask you.

06:05.329 --> 06:06.796
Till then, I want you to get
in Bartle here's back pocket

06:06.798 --> 06:08.130
and I want you to stay there.

06:08.132 --> 06:09.231
Understand?

06:09.233 --> 06:11.000
Yes, sir.

06:11.002 --> 06:12.736
Get your shit, get
a rack near Bartle.

06:12.738 --> 06:15.270
- You got that, Bartle?
- What, sir?

06:15.272 --> 06:17.640
You got a new
girlfriend to keep you company.

06:17.642 --> 06:19.409
<i>Then I
crushed his pretty yellow head.</i>

06:19.411 --> 06:21.180
- Is that your mom?
- Huh?

06:22.247 --> 06:24.013
Oh, yeah.

06:24.015 --> 06:26.015
You jumped right
in, didn't you?

06:26.017 --> 06:27.984
Into what?

06:27.986 --> 06:29.019
This.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.753
Oh, yeah.

06:30.755 --> 06:31.854
Well, it's just
something I'm getting

06:31.856 --> 06:33.823
under my belt, you know?

06:33.825 --> 06:36.325
My dad was in the Marines
before he went to college.

06:36.327 --> 06:38.060
I don't know if he, like
wanted me to join up

06:38.062 --> 06:40.330
- or anything, but...
- Mm-hm.

06:40.332 --> 06:42.198
I guess I just wanted
to do something good

06:42.200 --> 06:45.868
before I do whatever
else it is I'm gonna do.

06:45.870 --> 06:48.972
I think I'm gonna go to UVA
after this and study history.

06:48.974 --> 06:50.041
History of what?

06:51.676 --> 06:54.243
I don't know.
I just like history.

06:54.245 --> 06:55.647
What about you?

06:57.349 --> 06:59.149
Uhh, I almost
went to school.

06:59.151 --> 07:00.219
But then...

07:01.219 --> 07:02.952
I didn't.

07:02.954 --> 07:05.257
I just wound up
fucking around and...

07:07.892 --> 07:09.959
And not really doing
much of anything.

07:09.961 --> 07:11.960
So why'd you join up?

07:11.962 --> 07:13.462
Thing to do. I don't
know if it felt like

07:13.464 --> 07:15.931
a good thing, but...

07:15.933 --> 07:17.933
It felt like a thing.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.774
Is it too late to, I
don't know, take it back?

07:25.776 --> 07:27.243
- Come home?
- Ma.

07:27.245 --> 07:28.844
Ma, it's done.

07:28.846 --> 07:30.714
It's done. Okay?

07:30.716 --> 07:33.349
Okay.
Let's just have a nice talk.

07:33.351 --> 07:37.286
- Which base is it, again? Can I come see you?
- I don't know.

07:37.288 --> 07:39.354
I don't know if they let us
have visitors at the base,

07:39.356 --> 07:41.890
so I gotta find out.

07:41.892 --> 07:45.195
- Well, I'd love to come.
- Yeah.

07:45.197 --> 07:48.832
Oh, and your friends
have been asking after you.

07:48.834 --> 07:50.734
Especially that uh...

07:50.736 --> 07:52.656
What's-her-name? You know,
the one I never liked?

07:53.337 --> 07:54.803
Hey, man, look.

07:54.805 --> 07:55.904
It's just me.

07:55.906 --> 07:57.106
Come check this out.

07:57.108 --> 07:58.173
I gotta go, Ma.

07:58.175 --> 07:59.943
I'll write, okay?

07:59.945 --> 08:01.844
Okay, we'll...

08:20.031 --> 08:21.800
Hey, Sarge, you
got an extra razor?

08:23.467 --> 08:25.969
You don't got your own?

08:25.971 --> 08:28.139
I never needed one before.

08:29.373 --> 08:30.743
So how come you need one now?

08:34.044 --> 08:36.078
I think I wanna shave my head.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.179
Go get some clippers before
you waste one of my razors.

08:38.182 --> 08:39.422
That's
what I told him.

08:41.352 --> 08:43.052
You seriously
never shaved before?

08:43.054 --> 08:44.386
No, sir.

08:44.388 --> 08:46.188
How old are you?

08:46.190 --> 08:47.323
18.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.092
Just turned last week.

08:49.094 --> 08:50.260
And you?

08:50.262 --> 08:52.294
20.

08:52.296 --> 08:53.331
Fuck.

08:57.902 --> 09:00.739
Look, you guys are
my guys, right?

09:02.339 --> 09:04.307
I ain't supposed to be
telling anyone this,

09:04.309 --> 09:06.943
but our AO just came down
this morning from on high.

09:06.945 --> 09:09.044
We're gonna be shipping out.

09:09.046 --> 09:11.880
All right, you guys are gonna
be seeing some shit real soon.

09:11.882 --> 09:13.582
It's gonna be a goat-fuck.

09:13.584 --> 09:14.853
A what?

09:16.021 --> 09:18.487
A goat-fuck.

09:18.489 --> 09:21.223
So starting now, you guys have
to promise to do what I say.

09:21.225 --> 09:23.058
Yeah,
sure thing, Sarge.

09:23.060 --> 09:24.226
No, fuck that.

09:24.228 --> 09:25.395
Don't give me that shit.

09:25.397 --> 09:27.297
No sure thing this time.

09:27.299 --> 09:29.231
Promise you'll do what I
say every fucking time.

09:29.233 --> 09:31.366
- Yes, sir, we'll do what you say.
- I promise.

09:31.368 --> 09:32.869
All right now. Look, there's
some folks who go to this war

09:32.871 --> 09:34.136
and never pull a trigger.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.206
That ain't gonna be you guys.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.073
They're gonna kill the
fuck out of some of us.

09:38.075 --> 09:39.909
We're gonna kill the
fuck out of some of them.

09:39.911 --> 09:41.446
That's just the
way it's gonna go.

09:43.315 --> 09:45.515
Now listen, you stick with
me, you do what I say,

09:45.517 --> 09:47.851
I'll take care of you.

09:47.853 --> 09:48.887
All right?

09:50.855 --> 09:52.454
Yes, sir.

09:52.456 --> 09:54.056
I always
take care of my guys.

10:04.636 --> 10:05.905
Hey, Bartle?

10:08.906 --> 10:12.375
Why do you think Sarge
treats us like he does?

10:12.377 --> 10:14.043
Like what?

10:14.045 --> 10:16.178
You know, like...

10:16.180 --> 10:17.282
Like special.

10:19.050 --> 10:22.018
It's not special, it's just...

10:22.020 --> 10:25.020
He knows he can count on us.

10:25.022 --> 10:26.457
How's he know a
thing like that?

10:28.526 --> 10:31.461
Look, man, we're
gonna be fine.

10:31.463 --> 10:33.929
Okay?

10:33.931 --> 10:36.534
We just gotta watch each
other's backs, that's all.

10:38.603 --> 10:40.202
Yeah, I got your back.

10:40.204 --> 10:42.170
Okay, good.

10:42.172 --> 10:44.106
Now go to fucking sleep
or I'm gonna kick the shit

10:44.108 --> 10:45.143
out of you.

10:55.185 --> 10:57.120
Shit,
Bartle, you okay?

10:57.122 --> 10:58.520
Yeah, I'm good.

10:58.522 --> 11:00.225
- Were you asleep?
- No.

11:02.526 --> 11:04.062
Roger that. I'm coming up.

11:05.530 --> 11:06.966
Third Platoon, on your feet!

11:11.636 --> 11:13.405

Move!

11:41.432 --> 11:45.637

12:07.459 --> 12:09.661
<i>Everybody clear?</i>

12:14.531 --> 12:15.731

12:17.735 --> 12:19.604
- You up?
<i>- We need more 2-40's!</i>

12:22.007 --> 12:23.639
Let's kill these Hajji fucks!

12:26.176 --> 12:27.209
Come on, fuck you!

12:40.224 --> 12:41.223

Come on, come on.

No, no, no, no, no.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.303
Sid, come on!

12:54.305 --> 12:55.303
Come on.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.106
Come on.

13:01.813 --> 13:04.414
You didn't think you'd make
it that far, did you, buddy?

13:13.557 --> 13:15.424
Oh, we
got a vehicle, Sarge!

13:15.426 --> 13:16.461
One o'clock.

13:17.561 --> 13:19.127
Come on, you fucks!

13:23.435 --> 13:24.600
Wait.

13:24.602 --> 13:25.601
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

13:27.338 --> 13:28.571
It's a woman.

13:28.573 --> 13:31.140
Wait, it's a fucking woman!

13:33.610 --> 13:35.244
Hold off!

13:42.853 --> 13:44.089
<i>Clear!</i>

13:53.831 --> 13:55.698
Shit.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.266
That bitch just got murdered.

14:26.397 --> 14:28.130
Hey, Bartle!

14:28.132 --> 14:29.167
Bartle.

14:31.401 --> 14:33.104
Hey, come over here.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.273
Hey, man, come over here.

14:37.275 --> 14:39.274
Meet my parents.
My mom and dad.

14:39.276 --> 14:41.309
- Brandon Bartle.
- Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.412
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

14:43.414 --> 14:45.347
Proud of you, boys.
Very proud of you.

14:45.349 --> 14:47.316
Did Murph tell you
I was in your shoes?

14:47.318 --> 14:49.217
Yes, sir.

14:49.219 --> 14:50.819
Well, it's very brave
what you guys are doing.

14:50.821 --> 14:52.788
- Yes, sir.
- Where are you sitting?

14:52.790 --> 14:54.890
- Oh, no, I'm just grabbing...
- Is your family here?

14:54.892 --> 14:57.526
Uh, no, my mom had
to work tonight, so...

14:57.528 --> 14:59.162
Well, then, sit with us.

14:59.164 --> 15:00.663
Sit down this instant.

15:00.665 --> 15:03.199
- Yeah, take a seat, man.
- Come on.

15:05.402 --> 15:07.370
I just think this is so
nice that they do this

15:07.372 --> 15:09.539
for the families,
don't you think?

15:09.541 --> 15:12.408
- Yeah.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.476
So, you and Daniel,
will you be bunking

15:14.478 --> 15:16.478
over there together, too?

15:16.480 --> 15:19.649
Uh, I don't know what the
situation will be actually

15:19.651 --> 15:22.217
when we get over there, but
it'd be great to stick together.

15:22.219 --> 15:23.718
Yeah.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.654
Mm, well, you
should, because my boy

15:25.656 --> 15:29.357
will be getting more care
packages than anyone here.

15:29.359 --> 15:31.327
I can promise you that.

15:31.329 --> 15:33.295
So, if you need anything,
I just want you to know

15:33.297 --> 15:35.497
you can write to me and
I'll send it right over.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.399
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

15:37.401 --> 15:38.770
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:45.243 --> 15:46.775
Oh, hi.

15:46.777 --> 15:47.976
It was so nice to
finally meet you.

15:47.978 --> 15:49.779
Nice to meet you, too.

15:49.781 --> 15:50.980
So he's doing a good job?

15:50.982 --> 15:53.249
Yes, ma'am, very good.

15:53.251 --> 15:55.384
That's so good.
Thanks for looking out for him.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.952
You bet.
We look out for each other.

15:56.954 --> 15:58.190
Yeah.

15:59.757 --> 16:01.790
Brandon...

16:01.792 --> 16:03.592
Promise me you'll take
care of him over there?

16:04.829 --> 16:06.828
Yeah, of course.

16:06.830 --> 16:11.836
And listen, God forbid
something were to happen and...

16:14.305 --> 16:16.639
But if it does, I really
would like to hear that

16:16.641 --> 16:17.943
from you first.

16:19.944 --> 16:21.876
Sure.

16:21.878 --> 16:23.315
You bet, ma'am.

16:24.916 --> 16:26.015
Okay.

16:26.017 --> 16:27.286
Thank you.

16:29.686 --> 16:31.386
Okay, be safe, okay?

16:31.388 --> 16:32.420
I will.

16:32.422 --> 16:33.489
You too.

16:33.491 --> 16:34.526
Yeah.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.825
How many times we been
through that orchard, sir?

17:42.492 --> 17:44.526
Writing a history
book, Corporal?

17:44.528 --> 17:46.996
- No, sir.
<i>- Then quit counting.</i>

17:48.533 --> 17:49.834
What is this?

17:50.867 --> 17:51.902
A letter?

17:53.671 --> 17:55.571
- Hey, give it back.
- Oh, it's from Mama.

17:55.573 --> 17:57.073
- Come on, Bartle, give it back.
- "Dear Daniel..."

17:57.075 --> 17:58.774
It's so weird she
calls you Daniel.

17:58.776 --> 18:00.575
"We just got home.

18:00.577 --> 18:03.713
"Your dad took me out
for Valentine's Day.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.880
"It was nice, but don't worry,

18:05.882 --> 18:10.052
"he knows you're
my real Valentine."

18:10.054 --> 18:11.086
Is that supposed to
be for me, though?

18:11.088 --> 18:12.755
Because I think

18:12.757 --> 18:13.755
- I'm her real Valentine.
- Asshole.

18:13.757 --> 18:14.924
You wish.

18:22.065 --> 18:23.802
Some people ain't
cut out for this shit.

18:25.769 --> 18:27.570
What,
do you mean Murph?

18:27.572 --> 18:29.772
No, sir, Murph's
got his shit together.

18:29.774 --> 18:30.872
Murph's solid.

18:37.014 --> 18:38.680
Lieutenant Bellington.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.915
Carry
on, Lieutenant.

18:39.917 --> 18:41.149
How's the war, gentlemen?

18:41.151 --> 18:42.418
Sir...

18:42.420 --> 18:44.486
You tell me.

18:44.488 --> 18:46.248
Your mic's on, so
whenever you're ready, sir.

18:48.593 --> 18:51.494
Gentlemen, this
is the final push.

18:51.496 --> 18:52.995
We're gonna drop
fire in this rat hole

18:52.997 --> 18:55.965
for the next two
hours until dawn.

18:55.967 --> 18:57.600
We'll still be shredding
those palm trees

18:57.602 --> 18:59.438
when you get to them.

19:00.571 --> 19:02.638
We'll take this city.

19:02.640 --> 19:07.409
Once we do, the insurgency
will die on the vine.

19:07.411 --> 19:10.545
I know not all of you read the
Bible, but those that do...

19:10.547 --> 19:15.418
You know, this is the land
where Jonah was buried,

19:15.420 --> 19:18.521
where he begged God's
justice to come.

19:18.523 --> 19:20.121
And we are...

19:20.123 --> 19:22.757
We are that justice.

19:22.759 --> 19:26.030
Right now, as of this moment...

19:28.865 --> 19:32.101
This is the most important
day of your lives.

19:36.641 --> 19:38.040
You really think this is
the most important thing

19:38.042 --> 19:39.507
you'll ever do?

19:39.509 --> 19:40.746
I don't know.

19:43.748 --> 19:44.979
<i>You really think
this is the most important</i>

19:44.981 --> 19:46.017
<i>day of your life?</i>

19:48.585 --> 19:51.821
I fucking hope not.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.126
<i>You have anybody
waiting for you back home?</i>

20:21.651 --> 20:22.884
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

20:22.886 --> 20:24.119
What? What?

20:24.121 --> 20:25.955
I have a leg cramp.

20:25.957 --> 20:26.992
Okay.

20:28.692 --> 20:30.258
You okay?

20:30.260 --> 20:31.495
I'm good.

20:36.132 --> 20:37.999
Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

20:38.001 --> 20:40.069
Stop that.

20:40.071 --> 20:42.004
Tess, Tess, Tess,
Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess, Tess...

20:42.006 --> 20:43.138
Shut up!

20:43.140 --> 20:44.273
What?

20:44.275 --> 20:45.707
I hate that.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.176
You hate your name?

20:47.178 --> 20:49.578
I hate
when you do that.

20:49.580 --> 20:50.778
You know,
if I say it enough,

20:50.780 --> 20:51.980
it stops meaning anything.

20:51.982 --> 20:54.783
All I've got left is you.

20:54.785 --> 20:56.784
Same thing with your name.

20:56.786 --> 20:59.522
No, I got syllables.

20:59.524 --> 21:03.825
Mm, Bartle, Bartle, Bartle,
Bartle, Bartle, Bartle,

21:03.827 --> 21:05.963
Bartle, Bartle, Bartle...

21:20.678 --> 21:22.644
<i>"He changes rivers
into wilderness</i>

21:22.646 --> 21:25.313
<i>"and springs of water
into thirsty ground,</i>

21:25.315 --> 21:27.815
<i>"fruitful land into salt waste,</i>

21:27.817 --> 21:30.919
<i>"because of the wickedness
of those who dwell in it."</i>

21:30.921 --> 21:32.787
Look at the ground.

21:32.789 --> 21:36.691
Salt the ground, the
earth will bear no fruit.

21:36.693 --> 21:39.594
There'll be nothing to eat.

21:39.596 --> 21:41.729
These people will be no more.

21:41.731 --> 21:45.234
Their spirits will not
come back to haunt us.

21:45.236 --> 21:47.272
What you doing, Sarge?

21:51.942 --> 21:54.645
It's from Judges.

21:55.813 --> 21:57.880
I will not see their eyes.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.681
I will not see their bodies.

21:59.683 --> 22:01.853
I will not feel their flesh.

22:05.690 --> 22:08.724
What the fuck is Judges, man?

22:08.726 --> 22:11.997
Dude, I think Sarge
is losing his shit.

23:42.886 --> 23:45.120
One o'clock, one o'clock,
one o'fucking clock!

23:45.122 --> 23:46.822
Get down, move!

23:48.726 --> 23:49.858
I fell asleep.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.259
I fucking fell asleep!

23:54.164 --> 23:55.244
<i>Watch your right!</i>

23:58.068 --> 23:59.136
Let's go.

24:12.482 --> 24:14.284
The windows.
Eyes on the windows.

24:27.297 --> 24:28.330
Two shooters.

24:28.332 --> 24:29.732
Top windows.

24:35.972 --> 24:37.072
I got him!

24:37.074 --> 24:38.073
Shit.

24:38.075 --> 24:39.073
Goddamn.

24:39.075 --> 24:40.441
One shooter.

24:50.286 --> 24:51.386
You got him?

24:51.388 --> 24:52.387
Hold on.

24:53.891 --> 24:54.957
You see him?

24:54.959 --> 24:56.524
Wait, shut up.

24:56.526 --> 24:57.892
Wait.

24:57.894 --> 24:58.893
Wait.

24:59.997 --> 25:01.065
Fuck!

25:02.767 --> 25:03.765
Shit!

25:03.767 --> 25:04.803
Sarge!

25:06.437 --> 25:07.969
Where are you hit?

25:07.971 --> 25:09.470
Medic!

25:09.472 --> 25:11.206
- Where are you hit?
- I don't know.

25:11.208 --> 25:12.774
- We need a medic!
- Cover!

25:12.776 --> 25:13.775
Sarge!

25:13.777 --> 25:14.813
Shit!

25:16.279 --> 25:18.880
Hey, move, that's it.

25:18.882 --> 25:21.216
Let's get this off.
Come on.

25:21.218 --> 25:22.251
You're
doing good, man.

25:22.253 --> 25:23.788
You're good.

25:26.289 --> 25:27.989
Come on, take it easy.

25:27.991 --> 25:29.190
All right.

25:29.192 --> 25:30.425
All right, now look at me.

25:30.427 --> 25:31.560
Oh, fuck.

25:31.562 --> 25:32.794
Yes.

25:32.796 --> 25:33.832
Fuck!

25:42.940 --> 25:44.206
Come on, buddy.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.844
Vasquez, come on.

25:46.876 --> 25:48.043
Oh, shit.

25:59.422 --> 26:01.023
Oh, shit.

26:02.092 --> 26:04.493
Medic!

26:04.495 --> 26:05.593
Ah, fuck.

26:05.595 --> 26:06.964
But he's dead.

26:08.399 --> 26:10.901
Well, you can't
leave him here.

26:18.241 --> 26:22.076
What you looking at, Private?

26:22.078 --> 26:24.979
I thought he was
gonna say something.

26:24.981 --> 26:27.114
Well, they usually don't.

26:31.087 --> 26:33.167
This one guy said something
once just before he went.

26:36.326 --> 26:38.392
What'd he say?

26:38.394 --> 26:42.130
He just grabbed my
hand and he goes...

26:42.132 --> 26:45.903
"Hey, man, check if
I shit my pants."

26:48.572 --> 26:49.908
That's it?

26:50.975 --> 26:52.541
Yeah, that's it.

27:03.053 --> 27:04.386
Yeah.

27:04.388 --> 27:05.423
Come on.

27:07.557 --> 27:09.624
First squad, move out!

27:30.381 --> 27:34.181
Man, I feel fucking
crazy right now.

27:34.183 --> 27:36.083
You know, I was just
happy it wasn't me,

27:36.085 --> 27:38.152
that's the first
thing I thought.

27:38.154 --> 27:40.088
That's fucking crazy, isn't it?

27:40.090 --> 27:42.623
No, man, what's crazy
is not thinking that shit.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.862
You know?

27:57.141 --> 27:58.407
Third
platoon, on your feet!

27:58.409 --> 27:59.510
We're moving!

29:36.672 --> 29:38.073
Thank you.

29:38.075 --> 29:40.010
Oh, no, no, it's on me.

29:42.078 --> 29:43.413
You just got back?

29:49.085 --> 29:50.688
How was it out there?

30:40.871 --> 30:42.871
Brandon!

30:42.873 --> 30:44.840
Where were you?

30:44.842 --> 30:46.541
I was waiting.

30:48.245 --> 30:49.643
Let me look at you.

30:49.645 --> 30:50.644
Are you in one piece?

30:50.646 --> 30:52.147
Yeah.

30:52.149 --> 30:54.151
No, I'm fine, I'm just tired.

30:59.722 --> 31:00.721
Okay.

31:02.526 --> 31:03.557
Okay, Ma.

31:05.129 --> 31:06.164
Ah!

31:26.917 --> 31:29.284
Ms. Bartle?

31:29.286 --> 31:30.819
Is Brandon home?

31:30.821 --> 31:33.487
- He's out.
- Oh, that's too bad.

31:33.489 --> 31:36.524
Any idea where?
I know the area pretty well.

31:36.526 --> 31:39.361
Listen, whatever you're selling,
mister, we don't want any.

31:39.363 --> 31:41.329
- No, pardon, uh...
- You had him all ready.

31:41.331 --> 31:43.465
You don't get to take him
again, you understand?

31:43.467 --> 31:46.467
Oh, I'm not a recruiter or
anything like that, Ms. Bartle.

31:46.469 --> 31:48.303
I'm one of the good guys.

31:48.305 --> 31:49.871
Says who?

31:49.873 --> 31:51.505
I'm just following
up on a few things

31:51.507 --> 31:53.643
from Brandon's last post.

31:54.944 --> 31:56.511
I have a few questions for him.

31:56.513 --> 31:58.412
It's routine, more or less.

31:58.414 --> 32:00.649
Well, he's not here.

32:00.651 --> 32:01.682
Yeah, you said that.

32:01.684 --> 32:03.717
Mm-hm.

32:03.719 --> 32:06.289
Would you mind if I
ask you a few things?

32:08.292 --> 32:12.296
Has your son ever mentioned
the name Daniel Murphy?

32:14.430 --> 32:16.398
Garrett Sterling, perhaps?

32:16.400 --> 32:17.966
We haven't talked much.

32:17.968 --> 32:19.467
Hm.

32:19.469 --> 32:21.436
Right.

32:21.438 --> 32:23.671
Well...

32:23.673 --> 32:25.833
When you do see Brandon, will
you give him this for me?

32:30.846 --> 32:32.282
Thank you, ma'am.

32:35.451 --> 32:37.651
And what'd you
people do to him?

32:37.653 --> 32:39.821
He won't get out of bed.
He don't care about nothing.

32:39.823 --> 32:42.524
It's like he doesn't know
where he is half the time.

32:42.526 --> 32:44.859
- I understand.
- Do you?!

32:44.861 --> 32:46.861
You got kids?!

32:46.863 --> 32:48.166
About half a million.

32:49.600 --> 32:50.920
That's not even
counting reserves.

32:52.635 --> 32:53.703
Yeah?

32:55.338 --> 32:57.707
Well, I've just got the one.

33:08.919 --> 33:09.954
Thanks, Ma.

33:13.523 --> 33:15.626
CID, what is that?

33:17.294 --> 33:19.663
Criminal
Investigation Division.

33:22.466 --> 33:24.032
Jesus.

33:24.034 --> 33:26.304
What happened over there?

33:37.413 --> 33:38.880
Yeah, I'm trying

33:38.882 --> 33:41.315
to reach Staff
Sergeant Sterling.

33:45.055 --> 33:46.955
Right, yeah.

33:52.863 --> 33:54.963
No, no, no, I'm
just a friend of him,

33:54.965 --> 33:56.563
just served with him,
I was just wondering

33:56.565 --> 33:57.865
what he's up to, is all.

33:57.867 --> 33:59.269
No, I can...

34:00.469 --> 34:01.468
Yeah, thank you.

34:01.470 --> 34:02.640
No, I...

34:04.841 --> 34:07.309
I might call back sometime.

34:07.311 --> 34:08.346
Yeah, thanks.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.496
The moon looks different here.

34:36.906 --> 34:38.375
Not like home.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.678
Fuck home.

34:43.446 --> 34:44.745
Keep thinking about
home, you end up there

34:44.746 --> 34:45.987
with a flag shoved up your ass.

34:47.551 --> 34:49.049
Jesus Christ, get your mind out

34:49.051 --> 34:50.652
of your girlfriend's
pussy, Bartle.

34:50.654 --> 34:52.554
Don't have a
girlfriend, Sarge.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.022
Yeah, sure you do,

34:54.024 --> 34:56.458
or you wouldn't
say it like that.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.826
I don't, or at least
I don't think I do.

34:58.828 --> 35:02.429
She's going to school, so I
figured the best thing was...

35:02.431 --> 35:04.366
Well, you know.

35:04.368 --> 35:05.866
She
dropped you then?

35:05.868 --> 35:08.069
What?

35:08.071 --> 35:09.571
No.

35:09.573 --> 35:10.904
I'd kill the bitch.

35:13.676 --> 35:16.511
What the heck you
cackling about, Murphy?

35:16.513 --> 35:18.415
Everything's just
so goddamn funny, sir.

35:27.690 --> 35:28.725
Bran?

35:30.593 --> 35:31.661
Bran?

35:34.765 --> 35:35.964
Bran.

35:35.966 --> 35:37.368
Phone for you.

35:38.468 --> 35:39.533
Who?

35:39.535 --> 35:40.937
It's Tess.

35:42.071 --> 35:43.772
I'm not here.

35:43.774 --> 35:45.005
She and Luke and
the gang are going

35:45.007 --> 35:46.107
to the river on the weekend.

35:46.109 --> 35:48.076
They want you to go.

35:48.078 --> 35:49.544
Okay.

35:49.546 --> 35:51.078
What should I tell her then?

35:51.080 --> 35:53.681
That
I'll call her back.

35:53.683 --> 35:56.784
So should I tell
her you're not coming?

35:56.786 --> 35:59.853
Just tell her
whatever you want.

35:59.855 --> 36:02.757
Hey.
Your friends wanna see you.

36:02.759 --> 36:05.692
I'm not the one
who told them I was back, Ma.

36:05.694 --> 36:06.928
It's not like it's
a secret, honey.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.830
Everyone knows you're home.

36:08.832 --> 36:10.632
It'll be good for you.

36:10.634 --> 36:12.801
Ma, please, just get
the fuck out of my room.

36:12.803 --> 36:13.837
Okay?

36:23.747 --> 36:26.147
- What the fuck?!
- Get up!

36:26.149 --> 36:27.582
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- You don't get to stay

36:27.584 --> 36:28.949
in bed for another month!

36:28.951 --> 36:30.685
- Fuck!
- I can't take this.

36:30.687 --> 36:32.554
Who the fuck are you?!

36:32.556 --> 36:33.754
Talk to me!

36:33.756 --> 36:35.957
Listen to me.

36:35.959 --> 36:39.694
Let me fucking sleep, okay?!

36:39.696 --> 36:40.730
Okay?!

37:06.089 --> 37:08.522
What's up, hero?

37:08.524 --> 37:09.924
Same old, same old?

37:09.926 --> 37:11.158
Yup.

37:13.263 --> 37:14.728
<i>Deeply
troubled by the military's</i>

37:14.730 --> 37:16.598
<i>handling of the situation.</i>

37:16.600 --> 37:18.500
<i>They might be
covering something up.</i>

37:18.502 --> 37:19.634
<i>They might not be
covering something up.</i>

37:19.636 --> 37:20.835
<i>I don't know why.</i>

37:20.837 --> 37:22.971
<i>I don't know anything.</i>

37:22.973 --> 37:25.607
<i>No one will talk to me, and
all I have are questions.</i>

37:25.609 --> 37:27.542
<i>I'm not accusing the
Army of anything.</i>

37:27.544 --> 37:30.078
<i>I just wanna know
where my son is.</i>

37:30.080 --> 37:31.846
<i>Specialist Murphy was part</i>

37:31.848 --> 37:33.681
<i>of the Third Armored
Cavalry Regiment</i>

37:33.683 --> 37:36.187
<i>operating out of
Camp Tiller in...</i>

37:38.555 --> 37:40.554
Change?

37:52.669 --> 37:56.170
I wanna talk
to Captain Anderson, CID.

37:56.172 --> 37:57.475
<i>This is Anderson.</i>

38:00.609 --> 38:01.745
I ain't a coward.

38:03.046 --> 38:04.248
<i>Sergeant Sterling?</i>

38:06.549 --> 38:08.315
You
hear what I said?

38:08.317 --> 38:10.685
<i>Nobody
said you were, son.</i>

38:10.687 --> 38:13.221
<i>People who use that word tend
to not know what it means.</i>

38:13.223 --> 38:16.623
Yeah, I'm just saying...
I ain't running.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.062
<i>Then
what are you doing?</i>

38:19.863 --> 38:21.696
Thinking.

38:21.698 --> 38:23.630
<i>So why
don't you come in?</i>

38:23.632 --> 38:26.199
<i>You tell us your side
of things, Sergeant.</i>

38:26.201 --> 38:28.002
Ah, shit, sir. I
think we both know I ain't

38:28.004 --> 38:30.607
nobody's sergeant no more.

41:10.433 --> 41:11.799
We're still at work, people.

41:11.801 --> 41:13.671
Keep the channel clear.

41:16.004 --> 41:18.875
Come on, LT,
it's driving music.

41:21.377 --> 41:23.511
That's cold, sir.

41:23.513 --> 41:24.978
<i>Hey, I'm
taking requests.</i>

41:24.980 --> 41:27.047
<i>What you wanna hear, sir?</i>

41:27.049 --> 41:29.917
You're requesting
to get your ass sent home.

41:29.919 --> 41:31.085
<i>You're
gonna send us home</i>

41:31.087 --> 41:32.886
for playing music, sir?

41:32.888 --> 41:33.955
Personally, I wouldn't waste...

41:35.959 --> 41:37.024
Fuck!

41:37.026 --> 41:38.025
Stop, stop, here.

41:41.897 --> 41:43.196
Come on, let's move!

41:45.234 --> 41:46.433
My 12, on the roof!

42:01.984 --> 42:03.019
Oh, shit!

42:04.788 --> 42:05.987
No!

42:05.989 --> 42:07.825
<i>Man is down!</i>

42:44.893 --> 42:47.361
You're doing great,
just stay still.

42:47.363 --> 42:48.397
You okay?

42:49.832 --> 42:51.000
Lay back for me.

42:55.305 --> 42:56.370
Lay back for me.

42:56.372 --> 42:57.774
Just lay back.

43:04.980 --> 43:07.281
Ooh, it's almost over.

43:07.283 --> 43:08.317
Good.

43:11.221 --> 43:12.289
Okay.

43:13.957 --> 43:15.893
Okay, you're almost done.

43:23.366 --> 43:24.434
Hey.

43:25.468 --> 43:26.536
Hey, calm down.

43:28.303 --> 43:30.404
Breathe, just breathe.

43:33.509 --> 43:35.109
You're okay,
soldier, you're okay.

43:42.018 --> 43:43.183
We got Woodward.

43:43.185 --> 43:44.954
Yes, sir.

43:46.154 --> 43:47.888
We got Scotts.

43:47.890 --> 43:48.925
Scotts?!

43:50.593 --> 43:52.259
Murphy!

43:52.261 --> 43:54.228
Murphy!

43:54.230 --> 43:56.397
Private Murphy!

43:56.399 --> 43:58.266
- Murphy, no Murphy?
- Just to come on back.

44:11.147 --> 44:14.147
And as John did for Jesus...

44:14.149 --> 44:16.116
Let us wash it
away, wash it away.

44:16.118 --> 44:19.654
For unless you are born of
the water and the Spirit,

44:19.656 --> 44:23.223
you cannot enter
the kingdom of God.

44:23.225 --> 44:25.359
Private Whitaker, do you
take the Lord Jesus Christ

44:25.361 --> 44:26.560
as your savior?

44:26.562 --> 44:28.395
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

44:28.397 --> 44:30.163
Then I baptize you in
the name of the Father

44:30.165 --> 44:31.632
and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

44:31.634 --> 44:33.067
Amen, amen.

44:33.069 --> 44:35.036
Amen!

44:55.424 --> 44:56.524
Hey, Bartle.

44:56.526 --> 44:57.558
Hey, man.

44:57.560 --> 44:59.159
Where you been?

44:59.161 --> 45:00.397
I've been here.

45:01.431 --> 45:03.397
Your mom wrote.

45:03.399 --> 45:04.433
Thanks.

45:11.140 --> 45:12.373
You okay, man?

45:15.511 --> 45:16.546
Yeah.

45:20.216 --> 45:21.614
You looking at that girl?

45:24.087 --> 45:25.122
For how long?

45:26.589 --> 45:28.556
I've been coming
up here every day.

45:28.558 --> 45:30.223
Mm!

45:30.225 --> 45:31.491
Every day?

45:31.493 --> 45:33.627
She know you're stalking her?

45:33.629 --> 45:34.728
Probably.

45:37.165 --> 45:39.000
You talk to her yet?

45:39.002 --> 45:40.134
No.

45:40.136 --> 45:41.171
I just watch.

45:43.071 --> 45:45.605
See how she talks to them
on the way in like that?

45:45.607 --> 45:48.208
She always does that.

45:48.210 --> 45:49.743
Yeah? Just get yourself
like a fucking

45:49.745 --> 45:51.511
whooping cough or something

45:51.513 --> 45:53.480
and get her to take
another look at you.

45:53.482 --> 45:55.482
Hey, what's it called
when the doctor

45:55.484 --> 45:59.152
makes you take your pants
down and asks you to cough?

45:59.154 --> 46:00.788
You know what I mean?

46:00.790 --> 46:04.125
Fuck, dude, they could
send you home maybe.

46:12.502 --> 46:14.201
They should just bomb
this place off the face

46:14.203 --> 46:15.536
of the earth.

46:15.538 --> 46:18.339
I hate it so much.

46:18.341 --> 46:21.044
Yeah. Some fucking garden
of Eden, right?

46:23.078 --> 46:27.084
I'm never gonna tell anybody
I was here when I get back.

46:29.118 --> 46:31.317
When I get back, I just...

46:31.319 --> 46:33.788
I'm gonna get a place to myself.

46:33.790 --> 46:38.292
I'm not gonna go no place
and not talk to anybody.

46:38.294 --> 46:42.699
Wake up every morning
and go run, eat right...

46:44.667 --> 46:46.536
And let my fucking
hair grow back out.

46:51.274 --> 46:54.775
I might show up, and
if somebody says,

46:54.777 --> 46:56.377
"Hey, Murph, didn't
you used to be

46:56.379 --> 46:58.212
"in the Army or something?"

46:58.214 --> 47:02.516
And I'll just say, "That
was something I did

47:02.518 --> 47:04.851
"for a little while."

47:04.853 --> 47:06.087
Or maybe I won't even say that.

47:06.089 --> 47:07.123
Maybe...

47:13.228 --> 47:16.165
I don't want this
to be a part of me.

47:32.681 --> 47:34.248
All right, dude, let's
fucking get outta here.

47:34.250 --> 47:35.248
Come on.

47:35.250 --> 47:36.484
Come on.

47:36.486 --> 47:37.650
I'm gonna stay here, man.

47:37.652 --> 47:38.853
No, come on, there...

47:38.855 --> 47:40.587
Dude, let's go, seriously.

47:40.589 --> 47:42.388
Come on.

48:28.638 --> 48:29.672
Murph!

48:43.752 --> 48:45.622
Murph!

49:43.578 --> 49:44.812
Oh.

49:44.814 --> 49:45.848
Is...

49:47.315 --> 49:49.817
Are you Brandon's mom?

49:49.819 --> 49:50.853
Amy, right?

49:52.855 --> 49:54.321
And who are you?

49:54.323 --> 49:55.522
Maureen.

49:55.524 --> 49:57.426
My name's Maureen Murphy.

49:58.828 --> 50:01.297
My son served with your son.

50:02.265 --> 50:03.330
Did he?

50:03.332 --> 50:05.299
Mm-hm.

50:05.301 --> 50:08.969
Let me ask you, did your
boy come back an asshole, too?

50:08.971 --> 50:11.208
He didn't come back.

50:12.875 --> 50:15.875
- Oh, oh, my God.
- He's missing.

50:15.877 --> 50:17.580
They don't know yet.

50:18.747 --> 50:20.013
I am so sorry.

50:20.015 --> 50:21.348
Here.

50:21.350 --> 50:22.616
Why don't you come in?

50:22.618 --> 50:24.652
Thank you.

50:24.654 --> 50:26.553
Is there
something I can get you?

50:26.555 --> 50:28.422
No, I'm fine.

50:28.424 --> 50:29.690
I just wanna talk to Brandon.

50:29.692 --> 50:30.892
It'd be nice to see him again.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.560
You met him before?

50:34.562 --> 50:35.828
Once, yeah, I did.

50:35.830 --> 50:38.334
There was a party at the base.

50:40.669 --> 50:45.406
Well, I don't know when
Bran's gonna be home.

50:45.408 --> 50:48.641
Well, would you mind
if I just wait a while?

50:48.643 --> 50:50.611
I just have some...

50:50.613 --> 50:52.982
I wanna ask him some things.

50:54.382 --> 50:56.252
I just wanna know what happened.

50:58.721 --> 51:01.888
These people, they're
not telling me anything,

51:01.890 --> 51:06.759
and I'm just sorting
it all out myself.

51:06.761 --> 51:10.763
You know, I don't know how
somebody just goes missing.

51:10.765 --> 51:12.598
I just don't.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.335
And I just wanna know if was...

51:16.105 --> 51:18.004
- Oh, my, I'm so sorry!
- I'll get that, it's okay.

51:18.006 --> 51:19.005
Please, will you...

51:19.007 --> 51:20.440
Oh, gosh!

51:20.442 --> 51:22.478
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

51:26.448 --> 51:27.880
Oh, God.

51:27.882 --> 51:29.982
Here.

51:29.984 --> 51:32.689
I'm just a mess, I'm just...

51:37.526 --> 51:39.895
I really just wish
I didn't let him go.

51:41.897 --> 51:44.464
I know. Come here.

51:44.466 --> 51:45.501
I know.

52:04.453 --> 52:05.551
Ooh!

52:05.553 --> 52:07.423
Send it down.

53:36.645 --> 53:37.847
Shit!

54:02.671 --> 54:04.937
Jesus! Set him down.

54:04.939 --> 54:06.138
- No, I don't know.
- Bartle!

54:06.140 --> 54:08.007
Hey, Bartle!

54:08.009 --> 54:10.109
No, we just pulled
him out of the water.

54:10.111 --> 54:11.277
- Come on, buddy!
- Off the road. By the underpass.

54:11.279 --> 54:12.745
Wake up, buddy!

54:12.747 --> 54:14.547
I think he's waking up now.

54:14.549 --> 54:16.716
He's up.

54:16.718 --> 54:18.118
You all right?

54:18.120 --> 54:21.020
Yeah, no, I'm good.

54:21.022 --> 54:22.892
- Come on.
- I'm good.

54:26.794 --> 54:28.694
We heard a noise.

54:28.696 --> 54:30.732
So we ran over.

54:31.834 --> 54:32.833
It was Brandon Bartle.

54:38.741 --> 54:39.776
Bartle.

54:42.544 --> 54:43.579
Bartle.

55:12.741 --> 55:14.621
Try to
keep it together, buddy.

55:19.614 --> 55:21.248
<i>People just
like to say stuff.</i>

55:21.250 --> 55:23.350
My friend told me
something the other day.

55:23.352 --> 55:26.819
She said, "Maureen, you gotta
find your truth in all this."

55:26.821 --> 55:28.955
Your truth.

55:28.957 --> 55:30.022
What the hell does that mean?

55:30.024 --> 55:31.824
<i>"Your truth"?</i>

55:31.826 --> 55:33.659
<i>Like mine's
different than yours,</i>

55:33.661 --> 55:35.995
<i>or you got one and
I've got another?</i>

55:35.997 --> 55:41.667
<i>I was watching this show
the other day, about birds.</i>

55:41.669 --> 55:45.272
<i>They always said that if
you touch a baby bird,</i>

55:45.274 --> 55:47.207
<i>the mother'll, you
know, smell you on it</i>

55:47.209 --> 55:49.375
<i>and then she wouldn't
take her baby back.</i>

55:49.377 --> 55:50.978
<i>Turns out it isn't true.</i>

55:50.980 --> 55:53.813
<i>Birds can't even smell, really.</i>

55:53.815 --> 55:56.185
<i>Besides, that's her babies.</i>

55:59.053 --> 56:02.121
<i>Where they get these
stupid ideas, I don't know.</i>

56:04.026 --> 56:05.094
Bran?

56:27.982 --> 56:30.083
<i>Let us wash it
away, wash it away,</i>

56:30.085 --> 56:32.752
<i>for unless you are born of
the water and the Spirit,</i>

56:32.754 --> 56:35.121
<i>you cannot enter
the kingdom of God.</i>

57:00.448 --> 57:01.717
The usual?

57:02.785 --> 57:03.819
Yeah, yeah.

57:10.125 --> 57:11.158
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:11.160 --> 57:12.158
How you doing?

57:12.160 --> 57:13.159
Good. You?

57:13.161 --> 57:15.127
Yeah.

57:15.129 --> 57:17.964
Good, you've got like a
back room back there, right?

57:17.966 --> 57:19.966
Yeah, why?

57:19.968 --> 57:21.234
I could really use the
place to crash for the night.

57:21.236 --> 57:22.270
Yeah.

57:26.442 --> 57:27.644
Really?

57:28.810 --> 57:29.875
Yeah, I mean, it's just
fucking for one night, you know?

57:29.877 --> 57:31.812
No, man, I can't...

57:31.814 --> 57:32.879
You fuck, I've...

57:32.881 --> 57:34.214
Come on!

57:34.216 --> 57:35.752
- Private.
- Fuck!

57:37.051 --> 57:39.786
Hands where I can see them.

57:39.788 --> 57:42.788
I'm Captain Anderson, CID.

57:42.790 --> 57:44.824
I've been looking for you.

57:44.826 --> 57:45.861
Easy now.

57:48.096 --> 57:49.364
Are you armed?

57:50.364 --> 57:51.464
No.

57:51.466 --> 57:53.966
Sober?

57:53.968 --> 57:55.771
Wishing I wasn't, sir.

57:58.940 --> 58:01.975
Is that what the Army doctors
prescribed before you left?

58:01.977 --> 58:03.777
Disappear from sight?

58:03.779 --> 58:05.245
Drink yourself
into a black hole?

58:05.247 --> 58:07.114
Yeah.

58:07.116 --> 58:08.956
As I recall, that's pretty
much what they said.

58:11.919 --> 58:13.889
You ready to take a
ride to the base with me?

58:18.926 --> 58:20.395
It's time, son.

58:31.105 --> 58:33.241
Who do you think you're
helping by keeping quiet?

58:36.377 --> 58:37.814
Sterling?

58:40.549 --> 58:42.214
Why don't you ask Sterling?

58:42.216 --> 58:45.152
Sergeant
Sterling's gone.

58:45.154 --> 58:46.886
Gone?

58:46.888 --> 58:48.825
He took himself
out of the game.

58:51.359 --> 58:53.859
It's just you now.

59:12.314 --> 59:13.413
Fuck!

59:25.560 --> 59:28.363
Okay, so, where are you?

59:29.531 --> 59:30.563
<i>A stockade.</i>

59:30.565 --> 59:31.834
<i>Army jail.</i>

59:33.268 --> 59:34.337
Well...

59:35.937 --> 59:38.304
Are they gonna
let you come home?

59:38.306 --> 59:39.538
I think
this is gonna be home

59:39.540 --> 59:41.241
for me for a while, Ma.

59:41.243 --> 59:44.814
Oh, God, Bran.

59:46.114 --> 59:48.480
Ma, I need you to know...

59:48.482 --> 59:50.516
<i>You don't have to
say you're sorry, okay?</i>

59:50.518 --> 59:51.988
I know you are.

59:53.455 --> 59:55.120
Or that it's gonna be okay.

59:55.122 --> 59:56.589
Or you wish things
were different.

59:56.591 --> 59:58.491
You don't have to
say any of that.

59:58.493 --> 01:00:02.062
And I know you love me
the same way I love you,

01:00:02.064 --> 01:00:05.464
<i>so you don't have to
say any of that, either.</i>

01:00:05.466 --> 01:00:07.000
I know, Ma.

01:00:07.002 --> 01:00:08.400
I know.

01:00:08.402 --> 01:00:09.437
Well...

01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:14.641
Are you gonna let me
visit you this time?

01:00:17.011 --> 01:00:18.046
Sure, Ma.

01:00:24.152 --> 01:00:26.386
All right. I gotta...

01:00:26.388 --> 01:00:27.654
I gotta go, Ma.

01:00:27.656 --> 01:00:28.891
<i>Bye.</i>

01:00:32.194 --> 01:00:34.194
Thanks for that.

01:00:34.196 --> 01:00:37.397
They have an old saying
about situations like this.

01:00:37.399 --> 01:00:39.966
I don't know. What's that?

01:00:39.968 --> 01:00:43.402
You're only as
sick as your secrets.

01:00:45.406 --> 01:00:49.174
They've got an old saying
about everything, don't they?

01:00:49.176 --> 01:00:51.213
Just about.

01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:15.303
Help me.

01:01:22.444 --> 01:01:24.247
What just happened?

01:01:28.149 --> 01:01:30.049
Murph!

01:01:30.051 --> 01:01:31.717
Murph, listen to me!

01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:32.955
On here!

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:57.312
Hurry.

01:02:07.989 --> 01:02:11.093
Hey, we
need help over here!

01:02:57.305 --> 01:02:59.105
Bartle.

01:02:59.107 --> 01:03:00.609
Your visitor's here.

01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:17.158
Hi, Brandon.

01:03:18.426 --> 01:03:20.395
Mrs. Murphy.

01:03:27.701 --> 01:03:29.337
You look so thin.

01:03:36.777 --> 01:03:40.746
They said that you only
wanted to talk to me.

01:03:40.748 --> 01:03:42.118
Is that right?

01:03:44.819 --> 01:03:46.321
Yeah.

01:03:48.223 --> 01:03:49.458
Why?

01:03:54.629 --> 01:03:58.567
You said you wanted to
hear it from me first.

01:04:05.406 --> 01:04:06.441
Here I am.

01:04:10.212 --> 01:04:12.148
The day Murph, uh...

01:04:24.259 --> 01:04:29.228
We were on a morning patrol
a few days after the...

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:32.368
Camp got attacked
by mortar fire.

01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:36.171
Murph was in bad shape.

01:04:37.839 --> 01:04:41.641
We all were, but they
sent us back out anyway.

01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:43.609
<i>I guess they didn't want
it to look like we got hurt</i>

01:04:43.611 --> 01:04:45.180
<i>as bad as we did.</i>

01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.486
<i>Murph was with us, but...</i>

01:04:51.752 --> 01:04:54.222
<i>He wouldn't talk to anybody.</i>

01:05:11.406 --> 01:05:12.504
Halt.

01:05:12.506 --> 01:05:13.842
Hold up!

01:05:25.786 --> 01:05:27.555
All right, pull back.

01:05:31.859 --> 01:05:32.894
LT.

01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:41.366
That what I think it is?

01:05:41.368 --> 01:05:42.437
Yeah, maybe.

01:05:45.406 --> 01:05:46.638
Fuck.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.509
Goddamn Hajji motherfuckers!

01:05:49.511 --> 01:05:50.676
So we need to move?

01:05:50.678 --> 01:05:52.547
Motherfucking animals.

01:05:56.417 --> 01:05:57.620
Murph.

01:06:02.991 --> 01:06:04.958
Murph, what's up, you think?

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.428
Move back, move the vics
back! Move the vics back!

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:09.464
Move back!

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:12.835
Savior Six, this
is Three Agile, over.

01:06:17.372 --> 01:06:19.571
I need a EOD team
to my location.

01:06:19.573 --> 01:06:20.672
<i>All the way!</i>

01:06:20.674 --> 01:06:22.007
Sarge, what is it?

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:23.278
Body bomb.

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:29.382
All right, listen up!

01:06:29.384 --> 01:06:31.417
EOD's on the way.

01:06:31.419 --> 01:06:33.353
I want a clean sweep.

01:06:33.355 --> 01:06:34.386
No surprises.

01:06:46.334 --> 01:06:47.902
Clear. Two coming out.

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.705
All right, come on.

01:07:58.707 --> 01:07:59.908
Let's go, bud.

01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:03.710
Hey.

01:08:03.712 --> 01:08:04.747
Let's go.

01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:11.754
You can see her, too, right?

01:08:22.464 --> 01:08:23.795
Yeah, I see her.

01:08:23.796 --> 01:08:24.962
Come on.

01:08:24.965 --> 01:08:27.001
We're all clear in here.

01:08:29.069 --> 01:08:30.505
Let's go. Grab your weapon.

01:08:36.778 --> 01:08:39.138
<i>Savior
Six, this is Three Agile, over.</i>

01:08:43.484 --> 01:08:45.384
<i>Savior Three, pull
back, pull back.</i>

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:47.421
<i>Meet the vics at the
intersection, over.</i>

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:52.995
<i>Stand by to copy, over.</i>

01:09:01.502 --> 01:09:03.035
<i>Hang
tight, we are almost there.</i>

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:04.502
Copy that.

01:09:04.505 --> 01:09:05.569
Get safe, people.

01:09:05.572 --> 01:09:07.707
We making a hole!

01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:10.008
<i>All Savior Three elements,
pull back to the hard ball.</i>

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:12.511
<i>I say again, pull back
to the hard ball, over.</i>

01:09:21.956 --> 01:09:24.827
<i>I'll do the countdown.</i>

01:09:27.629 --> 01:09:29.694
Yo, whoa, whoa, where's Murph?

01:09:29.697 --> 01:09:30.761
Where's Murph?

01:09:30.764 --> 01:09:32.432
I don't know.

01:09:32.434 --> 01:09:34.566
Francazino,
where's Murph?

01:09:34.568 --> 01:09:35.567
<i>In five,</i>

01:09:35.569 --> 01:09:37.069
four, three...

01:09:37.071 --> 01:09:38.537
Murph!

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.671
<i>Two,</i>

01:09:39.674 --> 01:09:40.705
<i>one.</i>

01:09:47.581 --> 01:09:49.048
Murphy!

01:09:49.050 --> 01:09:50.085
Murphy!

01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:54.790
Private Murphy,
speak the fuck up!

01:09:57.759 --> 01:09:58.891
Hey.

01:09:58.893 --> 01:10:00.526
Hey, where's your boy?

01:10:00.528 --> 01:10:02.994
I don't know.
I don't know, sir.

01:10:02.996 --> 01:10:04.931
Well, when's the last
time you saw him?

01:10:04.933 --> 01:10:06.665
When we were checking
that building back there.

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:07.767
Jesus.

01:10:07.769 --> 01:10:09.569
What was he doing?

01:10:09.571 --> 01:10:10.703
I don't know, he was
fucking hanging back,

01:10:10.705 --> 01:10:12.107
but we left together.

01:10:15.742 --> 01:10:16.741
Ah, fuck.

01:10:16.743 --> 01:10:17.779
Yeah.

01:10:19.013 --> 01:10:20.679
We lost Murphy.

01:10:20.681 --> 01:10:22.914
I'm gonna take a
team, go look for him.

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:25.951
<i>Take off and sweep every
building east to west.</i>

01:10:30.257 --> 01:10:31.660
He was
sitting right here.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:48.010
Hey.

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:50.509
Hey.

01:10:50.511 --> 01:10:51.710
What?

01:10:51.712 --> 01:10:53.111
He say anything to you?

01:10:53.113 --> 01:10:54.614
Anything funny?

01:10:54.616 --> 01:10:56.015
No.

01:10:56.017 --> 01:10:57.452
- Look at me, anything?
- No.

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.721
Over here!

01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:17.072
That don't mean shit.

01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:20.172
Christ, a drop of
blood in this city

01:11:20.174 --> 01:11:21.577
don't mean a
motherfucking thing.

01:11:25.112 --> 01:11:26.647
So what do we do now, Sarge?

01:11:28.882 --> 01:11:30.048
Let's get going.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.752
Sun'll be down soon.

01:11:35.956 --> 01:11:38.693
<i>We searched for
I don't know how many hours.</i>

01:11:40.662 --> 01:11:42.661
<i>Second Platoon
formed a perimeter</i>

01:11:42.663 --> 01:11:44.329
<i>in case some dude nabbed him</i>

01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:47.133
<i>and was trying to
get him out of town.</i>

01:11:47.135 --> 01:11:49.168
<i>The rest of us worked
our way through the city,</i>

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:50.605
<i>block by block.</i>

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:53.338
<i>Our squad took point.</i>

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:03.583
Sarge.

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:04.620
Hold up!

01:12:09.323 --> 01:12:11.192
She was out earlier.

01:12:12.794 --> 01:12:13.793
You sure?

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:14.830
Yeah.

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:00.675
What's up?

01:13:01.943 --> 01:13:04.043
Alpha, sweep left.

01:13:04.045 --> 01:13:06.244
Bravo, 360 perimeter, hold here.

01:13:06.246 --> 01:13:08.047
<i>The
woman told Sterling</i>

01:13:08.049 --> 01:13:09.949
<i>that she'd seen an
American walking</i>

01:13:09.951 --> 01:13:12.418
<i>toward the edge of the city.</i>

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.819
<i>Alone.</i>

01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:15.788
<i>With no shoes on.</i>

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:17.356
Bartle, with me.

01:13:17.358 --> 01:13:19.728
<i>He looked lost, she said.</i>

01:13:21.261 --> 01:13:22.962
<i>Sergeant knew it
had to be Murph,</i>

01:13:22.964 --> 01:13:25.364
<i>but he didn't tell anybody.</i>

01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:27.298
<i>Whatever we were gonna find,</i>

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.200
<i>Sterling didn't
want any witnesses.</i>

01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:32.170
<i>He wanted it just to be us.</i>

01:13:32.172 --> 01:13:34.041
<i>In our report, we, um...</i>

01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:37.343
<i>We wrote that we returned
to base that night</i>

01:13:37.345 --> 01:13:39.214
<i>without finding Murph.</i>

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:44.720
But that's not true.

01:13:47.688 --> 01:13:48.723
No, ma'am.

01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:50.725
It wasn't.

01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:11.113
Hey.

01:14:39.773 --> 01:14:42.240
What's he saying?

01:14:42.242 --> 01:14:43.909
He said he saw a boy.

01:14:43.911 --> 01:14:45.410
What boy? Murph?

01:14:45.412 --> 01:14:47.746
That's all he
said, he saw a boy.

01:14:47.748 --> 01:14:48.783
Where?

01:14:50.384 --> 01:14:52.154
He's gonna show us.

01:15:27.554 --> 01:15:29.221
Something ain't right, Sarge.

01:15:29.223 --> 01:15:31.493
This feels like
a fucking set-up.

01:15:34.428 --> 01:15:35.927
Ah, fuck it.

01:15:35.929 --> 01:15:37.832
One way to find out.

01:16:59.112 --> 01:17:00.815
Help me get him out.

01:17:11.992 --> 01:17:13.027
Oh!

01:17:14.127 --> 01:17:15.930
Fuck!

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:22.871
Motherfuckers tried
to castrate him.

01:17:41.589 --> 01:17:42.957
I'm so sorry.

01:17:53.466 --> 01:17:55.334
<i>Best I can tell,
Murph slipped away</i>

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.973
<i>as soon as we stepped outside.</i>

01:17:59.639 --> 01:18:02.975
<i>Who knows what he was thinking?</i>

01:18:02.977 --> 01:18:05.412
<i>If he was even thinking at all.</i>

01:18:40.648 --> 01:18:41.683
Oh, God!

01:18:43.084 --> 01:18:44.952
Who the fuck did that?

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.154
Goddamn it.

01:18:51.091 --> 01:18:53.027
What do we do with him?

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.234
We do what we came here to do.

01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:04.205
Fuck, we take him back.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:07.274
No.

01:19:08.475 --> 01:19:10.542
We can't take him back.

01:19:10.544 --> 01:19:11.947
Not like this.

01:19:13.313 --> 01:19:15.446
Like what don't matter.

01:19:15.448 --> 01:19:17.085
We got a job to do.

01:19:18.285 --> 01:19:20.220
Look at him.

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.124
I did.

01:19:25.126 --> 01:19:26.758
Look at him.

01:19:29.796 --> 01:19:31.031
Ah, fuck.

01:19:44.144 --> 01:19:45.276
All right, fine.

01:19:45.278 --> 01:19:46.348
What, then?

01:19:48.282 --> 01:19:50.315
I don't know.

01:19:50.317 --> 01:19:51.618
Let me think.

01:20:12.072 --> 01:20:13.107
Fuck.

01:20:15.341 --> 01:20:19.445
You go get the Hajji with the
cart, bring him over here.

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:21.282
Go fucking get the
Hajji with the cart.

01:20:26.252 --> 01:20:29.221
Anyone hears about this...

01:20:29.223 --> 01:20:31.856
We need to fix it like
it never happened.

01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:33.428
Understand?

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:45.740
<i>"Fix it like
it never happened."</i>

01:20:47.707 --> 01:20:50.377
<i>That's what Murph wanted
more than anything.</i>

01:20:53.179 --> 01:20:57.115
<i>Getting separated,
wandering off...</i>

01:20:57.117 --> 01:20:59.153
<i>None of that was an accident.</i>

01:21:01.121 --> 01:21:04.890
<i>Murph was looking for
a way to disappear.</i>

01:21:04.892 --> 01:21:07.162
<i>And he finally found one.</i>

01:21:10.697 --> 01:21:12.733
<i>I didn't wanna take
that away from him.</i>

01:21:14.801 --> 01:21:19.174
<i>I figured if Murph couldn't
forget, then maybe...</i>

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.240
<i>Maybe he could be forgotten.</i>

01:23:34.942 --> 01:23:37.542
Like it never happened.

01:24:14.014 --> 01:24:17.518
You didn't think that
I would wanna see my son?

01:24:23.357 --> 01:24:24.859
Not like he was.

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:27.362
I...

01:24:30.496 --> 01:24:33.433
I didn't want you to remember
him the way that I do.

01:24:37.403 --> 01:24:39.607
That's not your
decision to make.

01:25:06.532 --> 01:25:09.801
This is probably gonna
seem silly now, but...

01:25:09.803 --> 01:25:11.035
Will you...

01:25:11.037 --> 01:25:12.536
Yeah.

01:25:12.538 --> 01:25:13.838
Just tell me where it happened

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:16.941
just so I kind of have an idea?

01:25:16.943 --> 01:25:19.647
No, that's not silly at all.

01:25:24.484 --> 01:25:26.651
We found him here.

01:25:26.653 --> 01:25:28.587
Right about...

01:25:28.589 --> 01:25:30.088
Here.

01:25:30.090 --> 01:25:32.860
And we carried him
to the water here.

01:25:34.495 --> 01:25:37.598
And then we just let him go.

01:25:39.565 --> 01:25:42.534
Right about here it
opens up into the gulf,

01:25:42.536 --> 01:25:45.739
and I guess that's
where he stopped.

01:25:53.546 --> 01:25:55.582
Or kept going, you know.

01:25:57.885 --> 01:26:00.584
There's nothing to
stop you out there, no.

01:26:00.586 --> 01:26:04.121
Nothing to get in your way
when you look out at it all.

01:26:04.123 --> 01:26:06.525
No trees, just...

01:26:06.527 --> 01:26:10.661
Sky and water, and
after a while you...

01:26:10.663 --> 01:26:13.468
Can't tell one from the other.

01:26:14.734 --> 01:26:18.602
There's nothing to shield you.

01:26:18.604 --> 01:26:22.709
There's nothing to keep you
from just taking it all in.

01:26:26.679 --> 01:26:28.782
That's where he is now.

01:26:32.752 --> 01:26:34.820
Somewhere.

01:26:57.577 --> 01:26:58.612
Ma'am?

01:27:02.014 --> 01:27:04.651
Was he ever happy over there?

01:27:07.653 --> 01:27:08.922
Sure.

01:27:11.724 --> 01:27:13.727
Why don't you
tell me about that?

01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:19.466
Well...

01:27:23.537 --> 01:27:26.670
There was this girl he liked.

01:27:26.672 --> 01:27:28.807
And, um...

01:27:28.809 --> 01:27:30.508
I don't know if she
ever even knew his name,

01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:32.979
but he liked her.

01:27:35.616 --> 01:27:39.750
One time, this wasn't that
long ago, there was a party.

01:27:39.752 --> 01:27:42.620
It was a Christmas party.

01:27:42.622 --> 01:27:43.957
And, um...

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:47.659
And that girl was there...

01:27:47.661 --> 01:27:54.633
And he was too shy
to go dance with her.

01:27:54.635 --> 01:27:57.701
And I kept trying to get
him to go talk to her.

01:27:57.703 --> 01:28:00.672
He kept saying, "No, no, no."

01:28:00.674 --> 01:28:01.876
And...

01:28:05.178 --> 01:28:08.646
And then she came up to him.

01:28:08.648 --> 01:28:12.586
And she made him get out
there and start moving.

01:28:14.854 --> 01:28:17.655
And he wasn't that good.

01:28:19.192 --> 01:28:22.761
But he wasn't that bad, either.

01:28:22.763 --> 01:28:25.632
And he was laughing
and smiling...

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:29.066
And having a real good time.

01:28:31.705 --> 01:28:35.242
And I just watched
and I could tell...

01:28:37.243 --> 01:28:39.212
He was real happy then.

01:28:45.719 --> 01:28:48.352
That's
what I remember.
