WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:04.961
Alright, come on.
Show me pregnant!

00:05.048 --> 00:06.571
Baby needs a new
pair of parents!

00:06.658 --> 00:09.226
- Ah, it's negative.
- Rats!

00:09.313 --> 00:10.836
You sure you peed on it enough?

00:10.923 --> 00:13.926
Yeah, like I was
putting out a forest fire.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.233
Doesn't make any sense. We've
been going at it like rabbits.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.801
We should have a whole yard
full of bunnies by now.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.281
Boy, you really did
drench this thing.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.891
Well, hey, you tell me
to pee on something

00:21.978 --> 00:23.588
I'm gonna pee on it.

00:23.675 --> 00:26.330
Good news is, we can still
keep doing the bunny hop.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.940
Yeah, I guess.
Just seems like a whole

00:28.028 --> 00:30.160
lot of hard work for nothing.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.814
You mean other than the loving

00:31.901 --> 00:33.598
and spiritual connection
we've been having?

00:33.685 --> 00:35.209
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.906
Hey, uh, you know,
we could always squeeze one in

00:36.993 --> 00:38.734
before I have to go to work.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.215
As romantic as that sounds,
I still have to take a shower

00:41.302 --> 00:42.607
wash my hair and shave my legs.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.392
Don't doll it up
on my account.

00:44.479 --> 00:47.786
I can power through, even
if you're stinky and furry.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.484
I know you meant
that as a compliment

00:49.571 --> 00:53.662
and what's weird is
I actually took it as one.

00:53.749 --> 00:55.968
Shall we adjourn to the
baby-making chamber?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.015
Yeah, let me grab my toothbrush,
so I can multitask.

00:59.102 --> 01:02.323
Okay, but that comes
out of your foreplay.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.065
At this point,
it is foreplay.

01:05.152 --> 01:10.331
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:10.418 --> 01:13.899
♪ I see love ♪♪

01:25.302 --> 01:27.217
I can't believe
she's not pregnant yet.

01:27.304 --> 01:28.827
And I've been giving
it everything I got.

01:28.914 --> 01:32.918
This morning, I almost
popped out an eye.

01:33.005 --> 01:35.051
You did it last night
and this morning?

01:35.138 --> 01:38.446
That's like pitching
both sides of a doubleheader.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.056
With nobody warming
up in the bull pen.

01:40.143 --> 01:44.452
Not like I can signal
to bring in the lefty.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.236
You might want to start
icing your privates.

01:46.323 --> 01:47.498
You can't afford an injury

01:47.585 --> 01:49.109
if you only got
one man on your roster.

01:51.023 --> 01:52.634
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.

01:52.721 --> 01:56.333
That's why I been holding my
Slurpee between my legs all day.

01:56.420 --> 02:01.251
So what's the verdict from
the magic pregnancy pee stick?

02:01.338 --> 02:03.993
No cigar. Mike's still
the only one showing.

02:06.082 --> 02:07.562
I'll get the fried oysters.

02:09.825 --> 02:11.479
I'm starting
to get a little worried, Carl.

02:11.566 --> 02:13.220
I mean, what if I can't
give Molly a baby?

02:13.307 --> 02:14.786
You got to stay positive.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.875
- It's gonna happen eventually.
- Better happen soon.

02:16.962 --> 02:18.181
I don't want to be
one of those old dads

02:18.268 --> 02:19.574
showing up
at a Little League game

02:19.661 --> 02:22.751
pulling an oxygen tank
behind my Rascal.

02:22.838 --> 02:25.014
Yeah, my grandma
used to take her teeth out

02:25.101 --> 02:28.974
and clack it at the umpire
if she didn't like a call.

02:29.061 --> 02:30.367
Oh, that's embarrassing.

02:30.454 --> 02:31.368
Yeah, but thanks
to those choppers

02:31.455 --> 02:34.023
I did lead the league in walks.

02:34.110 --> 02:36.460
I know Molly's got her
heart set on three kids

02:36.547 --> 02:38.288
and I can't even
give her one.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.376
Let me ask you a question.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.552
[clears throat]

02:41.639 --> 02:43.815
Are you taking proper care
of your testicles?

02:45.948 --> 02:48.255
Well, I'm not rotating
them every 5000 miles

02:48.342 --> 02:51.606
if that's what you're asking.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.912
The testes are the delicate
satchel that protects

02:53.999 --> 02:56.176
the precious spermatozoa,
the seeds of life.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.178
And oysters
make weenie go boing.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.574
Alright, can we please
stop talking about my junk?

03:03.661 --> 03:05.010
See, right there.
Calling it junk.

03:05.097 --> 03:09.014
A derogatory term
for your sacred lingam.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.538
Lingam?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.192
That's what the Hindus
call the male genitalia.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.542
The Egyptians have over
50 different words for it.

03:14.629 --> 03:18.023
It's like the Eskimos with snow.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.938
Still trying to get laid
at the library, huh?

03:20.025 --> 03:22.071
[sighs]

03:22.158 --> 03:23.681
Yeah, when someone says,
"Get the hell away from me"

03:23.768 --> 03:25.553
in a whisper,
it doesn't feel as bad.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.470
Here's an interesting fact

03:29.557 --> 03:31.646
in order to increase
the number of living sperm

03:31.733 --> 03:33.430
you need to keep your testicles
at the proper temperature.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.215
Hey, you know what?

03:35.302 --> 03:36.868
I got a really nice thermos
for Christmas last year.

03:36.955 --> 03:40.089
Instead of soup, I could
put my balls in there.

03:40.176 --> 03:42.309
Well, you ain't doing them
any favors by cramming them

03:42.396 --> 03:43.440
into those tightie whities

03:43.527 --> 03:46.617
which are neither
tight nor white.

03:46.704 --> 03:50.273
If I bleach my underwear,
the waistband loses its snap.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.537
Ah, don't blame the bleach
for what your belly does.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.235
Carl, I'm not
switching to boxers.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.845
Everything scatters
willy-nilly.

03:56.932 --> 04:00.283
It's like trying to
keep cats in a bucket.

04:00.370 --> 04:02.067
Well, it's better than stuffing
them into a bag and letting them

04:02.154 --> 04:05.897
boil to death in that tea kettle
you call a crotch.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.551
I'm not wearing boxers.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.423
Well, if you really want
to give those little fellas

04:09.510 --> 04:11.642
a fighting chance,
you should go full commando.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.776
That's even worse.

04:14.863 --> 04:15.820
It's like having loose oranges

04:15.907 --> 04:17.518
in the backseat of your car.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.348
Can't make a sharp turn
without one of them

04:21.435 --> 04:24.220
hitting the door handle.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.613
I'm just saying,
you want your testes

04:25.700 --> 04:27.136
at the proper temperature
for baby making

04:27.223 --> 04:29.356
and that responsibility
falls into your sweaty lap.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.053
Well, I'm not going
without underwear.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.316
I feel naked when I leave
home without my watch.

04:33.403 --> 04:37.886
Yeah, I can't do that either.
I prefer an animal print thong.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.409
Yeah, it keeps your kangaroo
in your pouch

04:39.496 --> 04:41.368
and lets your butt cheeks
breathe easy.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.766
You're really a sick
individual, you know that?

04:51.813 --> 04:53.554
Thought you said
we were going to a library.

04:53.641 --> 04:56.252
- This is a sex shop.
- They have books here.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.558
Yeah, but they're all
sealed in plastic

04:57.645 --> 04:59.734
and come three to a pack.

04:59.821 --> 05:00.778
Now, that's a sucker's game.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.302
The middle one is always weird

05:02.389 --> 05:04.347
and it's the one your
grandma always finds.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.870
Molly and I are trying
to get pregnant, Carl

05:05.957 --> 05:07.481
not get our freak on.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.004
When's the last time
you been in one of these places?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.614
This is not
your father's porn shop.

05:10.701 --> 05:13.138
They now offer a wide
variety of marital aids

05:13.225 --> 05:16.141
some of which can be used to
promote fertility and pregnancy.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.361
Really? So it's not just
a room full of sleazy creeps

05:18.448 --> 05:21.233
playing tug-of-war
with themselves?

05:21.321 --> 05:23.279
Not at all. It's a place
where healthy people go

05:23.366 --> 05:25.890
to enrich and enhance their
relationships and sex lives.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.849
- Alright, let's give it a shot.
- Alright.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.342
[instrumental music]

05:45.780 --> 05:47.303
Hey, where's Mike at?

05:47.390 --> 05:48.826
He's been coming through
that door every night

05:48.913 --> 05:50.741
at 6 o'clock straight up.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.831
Sometimes it's 6:30,
but it's always straight up.

05:55.659 --> 05:58.270
He called, and he and Carl
are going to the library

05:58.358 --> 05:59.576
then he had some errands to run.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.404
Bet you're just happy
to be off your back

06:01.491 --> 06:03.145
with your legs closed.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.713
Mom, stop!

06:05.800 --> 06:09.107
[whispers]
And yes, I am.

06:09.194 --> 06:11.327
Truthfully, it's a nice
break for everybody.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.068
[sighs]

06:13.155 --> 06:14.374
Right?

06:14.461 --> 06:16.201
No offense, honey,
but the walls are thin

06:16.288 --> 06:18.508
and you're a bit
of a backseat driver.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.467
Mom!

06:20.554 --> 06:24.384
"Slow down, speed up.
There it is, there it is."

06:28.692 --> 06:29.780
Don't know whether
you're having sex

06:29.867 --> 06:32.566
or giving directions
to a cabbie.

06:32.653 --> 06:36.221
Hey, I have a limited time
frame, and I know the route

06:36.308 --> 06:37.701
better than he does.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.531
Well, men will never
ask for directions.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.316
They'll drive around aimlessly
before you have to tap them

06:44.404 --> 06:46.623
on the head and say,
"I'll just walk from here."

06:49.104 --> 06:52.716
- Oh, hey, everybody's home.
- Hey, honey. What's that?

06:52.803 --> 06:53.935
Nothing, just a..

06:54.022 --> 06:55.458
[both]
Sex wedge.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.985
Went with the ramp
instead of the scoop, huh?

07:01.072 --> 07:03.074
I prefer the Shanghai Intruder.

07:03.161 --> 07:05.207
Costs a little more,
but it comes with a cup holder

07:05.294 --> 07:07.383
and a rearview mirror.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.300
Meet me upstairs.

07:14.042 --> 07:17.524
Well...time to make the donuts.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.706
We gonna have sex
on this thing

07:25.793 --> 07:28.883
or is Evel Knievel
gonna jump us?

07:28.970 --> 07:31.102
Although it's advertised
as an erotic device

07:31.189 --> 07:33.322
it's also a practical
pregnancy aid.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.237
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.065
It tilts the uterus
at an advantageous angle

07:37.152 --> 07:40.851
to allow sperm
an easy slide to the egg.

07:40.938 --> 07:44.159
Careful with that sexy talk,
casanova.

07:44.246 --> 07:47.118
Oh, and Carl also said orgasm
is good for blood flow

07:47.205 --> 07:50.600
which increases the chances
of fertilization.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.297
You and Carl aren't
gonna be on walkie-talkies

07:52.384 --> 07:54.125
through this whole thing,
are you?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.739
No, he just asked me to
text him when we're done.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.132
[groans]

08:01.219 --> 08:02.743
Best way is
for you to lay down

08:02.830 --> 08:04.222
and me to slide it
under your rump.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.268
That's how Carl and I
did it in the store.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.102
Rise and shine, sweetie!
Up and at them!

08:14.189 --> 08:16.278
What time is it? Oh.

08:16.365 --> 08:18.628
It's time to drink our tea
and make a pee-pee.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.413
You pee on it.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.198
- I already did.
- What?

08:23.285 --> 08:24.721
Just a little test
to make sure they work.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.854
It was negative, by the way.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.596
There's no way I'm pregnant
already from last night.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.598
I know that, but maybe
one of the ones from last night

08:31.685 --> 08:34.165
nudged a couple
stragglers forward.

08:34.252 --> 08:38.387
They're not shopping carts.
Please let me sleep.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.869
Why sleep when we can take
another ride on the rump ramp?

08:43.827 --> 08:46.003
Mike, you're starting to go
a little overboard with this.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.657
Hey, you're the one
that always says

08:47.744 --> 08:49.616
if you want to get something
done, you got to stay focused.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.574
That's more about
you cleaning the waffle maker

08:51.661 --> 08:52.749
when you're done with it.

08:52.836 --> 08:56.187
Hey, you got
to let that thing cool.

08:56.274 --> 08:59.626
Let me cool. I'm gonna go take a
shower and get ready for work.

08:59.713 --> 09:00.931
I suppose we could do it
in the shower

09:01.018 --> 09:02.324
but gravity's
working against us.

09:02.411 --> 09:05.153
My sperm aren't
the Flying Wallendas.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.198
I'm gonna go take a shower
alone..

09:08.286 --> 09:10.593
...and without your penis.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.116
The Hindus call it a lingam.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.118
They're considered
sacred over there.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.685
Quit going to the library
with Carl.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.774
Sit in a bar
like a normal person!

09:20.560 --> 09:23.780
♪ Once upon a time
there was an engineer ♪

09:23.867 --> 09:26.870

09:26.957 --> 09:29.481
- Hey.
- Morning, big guy.

09:29.569 --> 09:32.267
Why aren't you upstairs
trying to make Baby Huey?

09:35.531 --> 09:36.967
Don't start with me, Moranto.

09:37.054 --> 09:38.186
And not that
it's any of your business

09:38.273 --> 09:39.753
but I'm taking
the morning off.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.319
Oh, I was wondering
why I didn't see

09:41.406 --> 09:43.321
the ripples in my coffee.

09:45.497 --> 09:48.892
I'm kidding. Everything alright
between you two?

09:48.979 --> 09:51.068
Yeah, it's just that
getting pregnant is harder

09:51.155 --> 09:52.113
than I thought it would be.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.594
Mother Nature is a fickle bitch.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.727
Might I ask you
a personal question?

09:57.814 --> 09:59.076
No.

09:59.163 --> 10:01.470
In your youth,
did you perhaps

10:01.557 --> 10:05.430
abuse yourself
an inordinate amount?

10:05.517 --> 10:09.434
- Can't I just eat my cereal?
- I'll take that as a yes.

10:09.521 --> 10:12.873
My point is, your alpha squad
might have been mowed down

10:12.960 --> 10:16.703
years ago on Centerfold Beach.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.749
I wasn't a pervert.
I only did that a normal amount.

10:19.836 --> 10:23.666
What? Like every night and
a baker's dozen on the weekends?

10:23.753 --> 10:26.800
Not every weekend. Sometimes,
my mom made me go to church.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.759
Let's not forget sick days when
you stayed home from school.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.849
Oh, geez.
Sick days were free-for-all.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.809
Personal best was seven times,
and that was with strep throat.

10:37.201 --> 10:39.508
Mine was 11,
and I had the mumps.

10:42.859 --> 10:43.947
Eleven?

10:44.034 --> 10:45.514
And I was holding a ginger ale

10:45.601 --> 10:46.994
in my free hand.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.130
You know, everything doesn't
have to be a competition.

10:53.217 --> 10:55.916
Okay, so let's just say
a normal amount.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.439
So if it's not
your sperm count

10:57.526 --> 11:00.398
perhaps your testosterone level
is a tad low.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.444
Get out of here. I'm overflowing
with testosterone.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.011
I don't know about that.

11:04.098 --> 11:07.275
The higher your testosterone,
the less hair you got.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.580
- Really?
- Really.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.671
Now, you have
a luxurious head of hair.

11:11.758 --> 11:14.717
I, on the other hand,
am all man.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.507
You know,
I am thinning in the back.

11:22.594 --> 11:24.640
Nothing about you
is thinning in the back.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.947
Alright!

11:27.034 --> 11:28.513
I'm done talking about this.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.124
Hey, it's not your fault.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.735
Fertility clearly
doesn't run in your family.

11:32.822 --> 11:34.563
Probably why
you're an only child.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.347
Hey, don't talk bad
about my family.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.045
The reason I'm an only child
is my parents

11:38.132 --> 11:41.004
were horrible people
who hated each other.

11:41.091 --> 11:44.225
There's nothing wrong with
having a strong feminine side.

11:44.312 --> 11:49.534
Might be easier to adopt if
they think you're both lesbians.

11:49.621 --> 11:53.582
I'll show you who's a lesbian.

11:53.669 --> 11:57.934

girl into making me a grandpa.

12:14.995 --> 12:17.127
You're about two minutes
too late for your wife

12:17.214 --> 12:19.216
and about ten years
too late for me.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.837
Oh, man.
That is embarrassing.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.186
Seeing your mother-in-law naked.

12:32.273 --> 12:34.188
Horrible.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.234
So, how'd she look
for a woman her age?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.975
I didn't look.
She's my wife's mother.

12:39.062 --> 12:40.934
Right, right, but just
putting that all aside

12:41.021 --> 12:44.241
I mean, she's still doable,
right?

12:44.328 --> 12:45.765
Carl, this conversation is over.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.723
I understand.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.203
Hmm.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.814
So was she rinsing off
or soaping up?

12:51.901 --> 12:53.120
Sorry, I've got
a naturally curious nature.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.599
That's what makes me
such a good cop.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.341
That's what makes you
such a weird freak.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.561
Thin blue line, my friend.

12:59.648 --> 13:03.870
Gentlemen. Ha ha.
Welcome to Andre's Big and Tall.

13:03.957 --> 13:05.915
Are you here to take advantage
of our pre-Thanksgiving

13:06.002 --> 13:09.440
suit sale?
Free alterations the day after.

13:09.527 --> 13:11.399
- That's great.
- Absolutely.

13:11.486 --> 13:15.882
Our holiday motto is, "Too much
pie? We don't bat an eye."

13:15.969 --> 13:18.667
- And he knows all the angles.
- Just a marketing genius.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.712
Actually, Cousin Andre,
we're here because my friend

13:20.800 --> 13:22.453
is ready to make the leap
from briefs to boxers.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.021
Ah, are you looking for
a functional cotton blend

13:25.108 --> 13:27.197
or a silk pair that makes
a fashion statement?

13:27.284 --> 13:29.069
Just looking for something
that keeps my pants

13:29.156 --> 13:32.463
from making direct
contact with my ass.

13:32.550 --> 13:35.510
Practical and durable.
I'll go find a few options.

13:35.597 --> 13:38.600
By the way, fresh made
kettle corn right over there.

13:40.863 --> 13:42.604
Ooh, kettle corn.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.388
The man knows his clientele.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.131
What if this doesn't work, Carl?

13:48.218 --> 13:51.874
Maybe I'm walking around
with a scrotum full of duds.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.528
Look, there's a lot
of options out there.

13:53.615 --> 13:56.487
There's in vitro,
there's artificial insemination.

13:56.574 --> 13:59.882
Oh, I don't know, putting some
stranger's sperm inside my wife?

13:59.969 --> 14:03.190
She won't even rent
bowling shoes.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.322
Doesn't have
to be a complete stranger.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.194
Could be a very close friend

14:07.281 --> 14:08.499
who would only ask
for visitation rights

14:08.586 --> 14:10.197
on holidays
and every other weekend.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.851
That's very generous,
but it's never gonna happen.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.156
Just think about it.

14:13.243 --> 14:14.984
A little mocha combination
of me and Molly.

14:15.071 --> 14:18.031
You know it's gonna be cute.

14:18.118 --> 14:19.989
Can we go back to talking
about her mom in the shower?

14:20.076 --> 14:21.643
Alright.

14:21.730 --> 14:25.908
Alright, my free and easy
friend, I found several options

14:25.995 --> 14:28.389
in a cornucopia of styles
and patterns.

14:28.476 --> 14:31.131
Alright. I got to try to wrap
my head around boxer shorts.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.697
I just sell them.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.221
Whatever you do with them
after you leave the store

14:34.308 --> 14:36.049
is none of my business.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.529
Alright, now I have paisley

14:38.616 --> 14:41.532
polka dot, hot peppers

14:41.619 --> 14:43.099
and choo-choos.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.754
Oh, I love the choo-choos!

14:45.841 --> 14:48.148
Man, some of those
trains look actual size.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.160
Finish what you're doing
and meet me upstairs.

15:00.247 --> 15:03.250
I got a bag full
of baby-making ingredients.

15:03.337 --> 15:05.861
I got boxer shorts to regulate
my testes temperature

15:05.948 --> 15:08.342
and keep my sperm motile.

15:08.429 --> 15:12.041
I got Chinese herbs and a CD of
dolphins mating to set the mood.

15:12.128 --> 15:13.695
Can't wait.

15:13.782 --> 15:16.002
Also, Samuel gave me
an African fertility necklace

15:16.089 --> 15:19.527
made from dried rhino penis.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.443
You need anything else,
like maybe a live bat

15:22.530 --> 15:25.837
or some chicken blood?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.492
Let's see if the dry rhino penis
works before we start doing

15:28.579 --> 15:30.277
anything crazy.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.325
Pee-ew! Something smells
like dried rhino penis.

15:38.589 --> 15:42.332
- 'Don't forget the wedge!'
- How could I forget the wedge?

15:44.117 --> 15:47.642
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.557
Other than the fact that..

15:49.644 --> 15:51.428
...I can't turn my back
without Mike humping me

15:51.515 --> 15:54.083
like a chihuahua.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.650
Just blast him
with a squirt gun

15:55.737 --> 15:58.914
until he rolls over
onto his back.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.568
Water's not gonna
slow him down.

16:00.655 --> 16:03.092
He wanted to climb in the
shower with me this morning.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.833
I'm not trying
to stir things up

16:04.920 --> 16:07.488
but I think he tried
the same thing with mom.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.016
I think it's cute
that he's so excited

16:14.103 --> 16:15.757
about having a baby.

16:15.844 --> 16:18.847
I know, I just wish
he would relax a little.

16:18.934 --> 16:22.111
Well, guys get pretty focused
when they have a project.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.679
Especially when their project
involves their penis.

16:26.594 --> 16:29.640
It's.. You know, I miss
the good old days when our sex

16:29.727 --> 16:33.383
wasn't scheduled and I wasn't
propped up on a ramp.

16:38.562 --> 16:41.609
He'll calm down eventually. He's
just trying to give you a baby.

16:41.696 --> 16:43.132
I know.

16:43.219 --> 16:45.569
I wish I had a guy like that
to share my life with.

16:45.656 --> 16:48.659
Completely devoted
and ready to start a family.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.270
Thought you loved your freedom.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.968
I mean, dating all the
different guys you want.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.970
Sweetie, I'm just trying to find
someone who loves me

16:55.057 --> 16:57.929
just as much as Mike loves you.

16:58.017 --> 17:03.022
I know he loves me.
I-I just miss the romance.

17:03.109 --> 17:06.242
Well, what could
be more romantic than a man

17:06.329 --> 17:08.679
trying to give you
what he knows you want?

17:11.247 --> 17:13.684
Yeah.
Thank you.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.514
Well, I got to get
back out there

17:17.601 --> 17:19.908
because the guys with jobs
go home pretty early.

17:22.171 --> 17:23.825
Hey, ask for a picture ID

17:23.912 --> 17:26.088
and-and check for
wedding ring tan lines.

17:26.175 --> 17:27.611
Always do.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.616

17:58.903 --> 18:02.037
- Oh, what is burning?
- Uh, I hope it's incense.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.126
I found it in your sister's
room, but if I start to giggle

18:04.213 --> 18:06.998
and try to order a pizza,
blow it out.

18:07.086 --> 18:10.785
Alright, sit down for a second.
We need to talk.

18:10.872 --> 18:14.963
I-I love that you're so gung-ho
about having a baby.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.443
Well, I know it's
taking a little longer

18:16.530 --> 18:18.140
than you probably wanted,
but don't worry.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.186
I will knock you up
or die trying.

18:20.273 --> 18:22.797
Okay, that right there

18:22.884 --> 18:25.016
is-is kind of
what I wanted to address.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.106
- You know I love you, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.846
I wouldn't be busting
my hump like this for someone

18:28.933 --> 18:31.110
who didn't love me.

18:31.197 --> 18:34.243
I-I'm gonna love you,
no matter what happens.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.289
I mean, if we make a baby,
if we don't make a baby.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.334
- We're gonna make a baby.
- I know.

18:38.421 --> 18:41.729
But I don't want us to lose
sight of what we already have

18:41.816 --> 18:44.514
which is wonderful,
whether we have a baby or not.

18:44.601 --> 18:47.126
- We're having a baby.
- I know we are!

18:48.257 --> 18:49.998
[sighs]
I just..

18:50.085 --> 18:51.695
I want our baby
to be a labor of love

18:51.782 --> 18:56.178
and not like we're putting
together an Adirondack chair.

18:56.265 --> 18:57.919
Going a little overboard, huh?

18:58.006 --> 19:00.791
Is it the underpants or
the fertility necklace?

19:00.878 --> 19:03.968
The rhino penis necklace
freaks me out, yeah.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.451
But the underpants
are pretty sexy.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.671
Yeah, you like them? I got
them in chili pepper too.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.716
Ooh, spicy.

19:14.544 --> 19:18.635
Oh, that smells really terrible.

Well, it is dried rhino penis.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.944
Yeah.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.251
Pretty sure a fresh one
doesn't smell any better.

19:35.478 --> 19:37.001
Oh, negative.

19:37.088 --> 19:39.178
Hey, no big deal.
It'll happen when it happens.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.310
The important thing is
we're having fun trying.

19:41.397 --> 19:44.226
Exactly. Not about the results,
it's about the process.

has been sweet, sexy goodness

Oh.

19:50.711 --> 19:53.104
What is going
on back there?

19:53.192 --> 19:55.977
Are you not wearing underwear?

19:56.064 --> 19:58.458
I am not.

19:58.545 --> 20:01.374
Taking a little break, letting
my fellas breathe free and easy.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.071
You're going full cowboy.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.334
