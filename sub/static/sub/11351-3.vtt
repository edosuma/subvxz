02:16.811 --> 02:19.083
Spring-heeled Jack kills again.

02:20.831 --> 02:24.218
Have you seen Spring-heeled Jack?

02:28.136 --> 02:30.512
Do you know what he'd do?

02:33.441 --> 02:37.533
When Spring-heeled comes, he'll
take these daggers

02:38.192 --> 02:41.487
and he'll fly up the air,
ha! Ha! Ha!

02:44.350 --> 02:47.308
It's remarkable how the actions
of one deranged individual

02:47.428 --> 02:49.263
can provoke such hysteria.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.857
A beast.

02:51.409 --> 02:53.463
People are afraid, Henry.

02:54.152 --> 02:56.191
Three innocent victims have
been killed.

02:56.696 --> 02:57.815
Ghastly deaths.

02:57.935 --> 03:00.650
So you believe all this talk in
monsters then, do you?

03:01.680 --> 03:04.516
There are many things in this
world we do not yet understand.

03:05.849 --> 03:08.761
You're still in a disturbed
state of mind, my dear.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.523
No doubt from your recent
unhappy experience.

03:14.382 --> 03:17.784
Now, my contacts on the police
force assure me

03:17.904 --> 03:21.217
that this drivel has no more basis
in fact than a fairy story.

03:21.337 --> 03:23.562
These murders were comitted
by a man,

03:23.682 --> 03:25.923
not a ghoul and not a beast.

03:26.043 --> 03:28.758
- Cabbie!
- But the nature of the wounds?

03:28.878 --> 03:32.375
Clearly no human being could
inflict such suffering.

03:33.806 --> 03:35.982
Not the sort of thing a
womal talks about.

03:41.696 --> 03:42.891
Of course not.

03:46.370 --> 03:47.933
Forgive me Henry.

04:01.692 --> 04:03.807
We have to find out what
Connor's doing.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.960
He won't tell me anything,
he worked straight through the night.

04:08.258 --> 04:10.894
I haven't even seen him.
He's obsessed.

04:11.813 --> 04:14.633
Well if he won't tell you, we're gonna
have to find out some other way,

04:15.147 --> 04:17.077
and you're the only person
can do that.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.124
You want me to break into
his lab?

04:23.287 --> 04:26.674
If I get caught it's a disaster, lose
Philip's trust. If you get caught...

04:26.919 --> 04:28.605
I'm just the jealous
girlfriend, right.

04:29.798 --> 04:31.790
You're asking me to lie
to him.

04:33.430 --> 04:35.683
To risk our whole future
together.

04:38.214 --> 04:40.068
He's already risking it Abby,

04:40.620 --> 04:43.823
and it's not just your future...
it's everyone's.

04:48.697 --> 04:49.739
I can't.

05:04.029 --> 05:06.236
You know what? I've got
to go and join the team.

05:06.696 --> 05:07.845
This doesn't feel right.

05:07.965 --> 05:10.297
Philip pulled you out of
the field for a reason.

05:10.417 --> 05:12.949
You have more important work
to do here Connor.

05:13.592 --> 05:15.278
We're so close.

05:16.871 --> 05:18.924
You told Philip this would work.

05:19.890 --> 05:21.821
Yeah, I-I did...
it will.

05:22.219 --> 05:24.166
Then you're making the
right decision.

05:24.496 --> 05:26.733
If they need you, they'll call.

05:31.208 --> 05:31.959
Okay.

05:44.819 --> 05:47.455
SUV skids, tires screeching)

06:04.153 --> 06:07.264
First floor, buildings
been cleared.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.038
Motion detector.

06:32.221 --> 06:36.681
Video installation, bit old and tired,
more of a post-impressionist myself.

06:37.478 --> 06:38.903
Anomaly's this way.

06:40.719 --> 06:43.799
You know, the more I get to know
him, the more frightened I get.

07:08.422 --> 07:10.031
Someone must have triggered it.

07:36.854 --> 07:37.973
- Don't shoot.
- What?

07:38.093 --> 07:39.564
I think it likes you.

07:39.939 --> 07:42.590
It doesn't like me... it's
threatened by me.

07:43.236 --> 07:44.968
It senses that I'm the
alpha male.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.380
We can usher it back in.
Make a run for the anomaly.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.943
Seriously Becker, run.

07:54.526 --> 07:55.676
Come on!

08:17.587 --> 08:18.966
Any injuries?

08:19.456 --> 08:21.311
- Good work everyone.
- Everyone?

08:21.632 --> 08:22.889
Next time <i>you</i> run.

08:24.856 --> 08:27.554
Guys.... we've got a problem.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.443
What?

08:29.286 --> 08:31.799
We've just sent a raptor back to
the late 1860's

08:31.919 --> 08:32.427
What?

08:32.902 --> 08:34.159
How's that even possible?

08:38.616 --> 08:41.573
Victorian newspaper, device
is correct.

08:42.078 --> 08:43.719
It must have blown through
the anomaly.

08:44.302 --> 08:45.528
Spring-heeled Jack.

08:45.778 --> 08:49.211
That's claws... even given it
a nickname.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.422
Jess we've just sent a raptor back
to Victorian London

08:54.542 --> 08:57.119
I need you to check news
archives for the period.

08:57.239 --> 08:59.326
Look for references to a
Spring-heeled Jack.

08:59.446 --> 09:02.483
Start at January 21, 1868.

09:05.706 --> 09:07.193
This is not good.

09:07.313 --> 09:08.633
How <i>not</i> good?

09:08.753 --> 09:13.032
In the last month this "Spring-Heeled Jack"
has killed at least another 12 people.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.687
- Oh.
- Great.

09:17.612 --> 09:18.396
Give me your gun.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.959
Matt what are you doing?

09:20.680 --> 09:23.883
I gonna go through it. 12 People and
that's only the ones we know about.

09:24.003 --> 09:24.651
No arguements.

09:24.771 --> 09:27.609
I'm not arguing, let's fix this.

09:28.299 --> 09:29.509
Becker what about the rules?

09:29.629 --> 09:32.620
We made a colossal mistake. It's our fault
and we need to fix it. I'm coming with you.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.305
No you're not, I'm going
on my own.

09:34.425 --> 09:36.849
The more of us there are the
more attention we draw to ourselves.

09:36.969 --> 09:38.119
Unlock the anomaly.

09:41.436 --> 09:44.731
Now listen. While I'm gone you
have to do what we discussed.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.060
Matt... I can't.

09:47.180 --> 09:50.033
I wouldn't ask you if it wasn't
crucial. You have to get in there.

09:54.487 --> 09:55.376
Good luck.

09:56.112 --> 09:57.001
You too.

13:04.299 --> 13:05.280
Hey!

13:08.026 --> 13:08.915
Hey.

13:10.494 --> 13:12.271
You need to get out of here.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.199
I mean it.

13:22.661 --> 13:23.611
Emily.

13:24.730 --> 13:26.063
What are you doing here?

13:27.259 --> 13:28.040
I live here.

13:28.327 --> 13:29.292
What are you doing here?

13:29.412 --> 13:31.085
We put a raptor back
through by mistake.

13:31.376 --> 13:32.832
That wasn't very clever was it?

13:33.124 --> 13:34.641
Not my finest moment no.

13:40.735 --> 13:42.804
Whoa! Whoa there.

13:52.054 --> 13:53.188
Halt here driver.

13:53.308 --> 13:53.832
Whoa.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.000
Oh Mr. Webster.

14:02.161 --> 14:04.966
This business must go smoothly, yes?

14:05.962 --> 14:08.552
There must be no fuss or
embarrassment, do you understand?

14:08.672 --> 14:10.776
You're doing the right thing sir.

14:10.896 --> 14:13.473
I assure you she will be treated
with the utmost respect.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.293
I'm talking about discretion man.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.126
She's caused more than enough
scandal as it is.

14:19.739 --> 14:22.773
I'm a laughingstock in every
club in London.

14:23.417 --> 14:25.808
I want her locked away where
she can't harm me anymore.

14:26.668 --> 14:28.583
Or herself of course.

14:36.631 --> 14:38.915
The original anomaly the raptor
came through. Did you see it?

14:39.035 --> 14:40.555
I searched. It must have closed.

14:40.675 --> 14:42.440
Whoa!

14:48.727 --> 14:49.800
You look good.

14:50.374 --> 14:51.891
It's protection.

14:52.466 --> 14:56.037
After the first killing, the description of
the wounds, I knew I had to do something.

14:56.157 --> 14:56.757
Wait.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.673
Your Spring-heeled Jack.

15:03.915 --> 15:05.723
Emily. If they catch you,
you'll hang.

15:05.843 --> 15:07.394
You have to go home
and let me deal with this.

15:07.514 --> 15:09.003
What are you even doing here Matt?

15:09.386 --> 15:10.781
What happened to stopping Philip?

15:11.508 --> 15:15.110
Philip is under control. I'm
here because it's my job.

15:15.230 --> 15:16.780
And that's the only
reason you're here?

15:20.275 --> 15:21.347
Yeah.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.969
Emily where're you going?

15:28.613 --> 15:29.916
I'm going after it.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.768
Listen. Abby looked into what
happened to you.

15:32.753 --> 15:33.657
Stop there.

15:33.979 --> 15:35.174
I don't want to know.

15:35.420 --> 15:36.385
I have to go.

15:36.505 --> 15:37.718
- But your husband...
- Matt!

15:38.373 --> 15:39.737
I don't want to hear it.

15:39.998 --> 15:42.879
I've finally got my life back.
A normal life.

15:43.418 --> 15:45.931
Whatever's going to happen to me
will happen.

15:46.051 --> 15:47.425
I don't want to change it.

15:48.053 --> 15:48.804
I can't.

15:52.416 --> 15:53.351
Henry.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.784
What are you...

15:58.837 --> 16:00.477
Oh I had you followed.

16:01.822 --> 16:02.833
I can explain.

16:05.653 --> 16:06.650
Outside.

16:09.837 --> 16:10.741
NOW!

16:11.963 --> 16:14.262
Henry this is not what you think.

16:15.288 --> 16:16.913
This man means nothing to me.

16:25.038 --> 16:26.279
What have you done?

16:26.399 --> 16:27.429
Let go of her or I'll shot.

16:27.549 --> 16:28.057
Matt.

16:28.177 --> 16:30.249
He is gonna have you
committed as a lunatic.

16:30.369 --> 16:33.313
Thrown into Bedlam hospital where
you'll stay until you die.

16:37.866 --> 16:38.832
Henry?

16:41.697 --> 16:42.341
Matt!

16:52.997 --> 16:54.330
I'll take those I think.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.863
Henry I'm not mad.

16:55.983 --> 16:57.227
Please hear me out.

16:57.347 --> 16:58.577
You're just not well.

16:59.264 --> 17:01.106
You're not well, you haven't
been well for some time.

17:01.226 --> 17:01.504
No.

17:01.624 --> 17:02.776
Hector bind her.

17:03.296 --> 17:04.998
Ah! She bit me.

17:05.117 --> 17:06.837
Leave me alone Henry.

17:06.957 --> 17:08.277
Get off me.

17:08.396 --> 17:09.012
Take the back roads.

17:12.026 --> 17:12.884
Gidup!

17:28.740 --> 17:29.552
Ready?

17:32.372 --> 17:33.445
Not really no.

17:34.610 --> 17:35.913
It's never stopped me before.

17:36.033 --> 17:37.706
I'll call Philip.

17:37.826 --> 17:40.050
No. We should uh.. we
should test it first.

17:40.739 --> 17:41.352
Yeah.

17:42.685 --> 17:43.344
Okay.

18:12.185 --> 18:13.641
This is completely fried.

18:15.158 --> 18:16.691
Only the inner coil.

18:16.811 --> 18:19.972
We'll rebuild it, try again.
It was working Connor.

18:20.092 --> 18:24.279
We don't know that. We're muck...
I can't do this.

18:24.399 --> 18:24.922
Yes.

18:25.299 --> 18:25.974
You can.

18:29.391 --> 18:32.870
The parts we need are at New
Dawn. I'll get them.

18:33.698 --> 18:35.859
We'll try again. We're
nearly there Connor.

18:47.470 --> 18:48.880
- Are you Okay?
- Umm.

18:49.677 --> 18:50.198
Yeah.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.427
Look, I know it's none of my
buisness Abby, but...

18:56.216 --> 18:57.427
Connor loves you.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.205
Everyone can see it.

19:02.592 --> 19:06.133
But what if that's not enough. What if I
did something he couldn't forgive?

19:07.833 --> 19:09.994
There isn't.... there isn't
someone else.

19:10.114 --> 19:11.862
No... course not.

19:12.628 --> 19:13.486
It's just.

19:14.628 --> 19:16.574
Suppose I have to do something
I know is for his own good

19:16.694 --> 19:17.938
but he doesn't see it that way?

19:19.360 --> 19:21.322
What if I have to lie to
do the right thing.

19:21.629 --> 19:25.077
All I know is, once you start lying
that's usually the beginning of the end.

19:25.782 --> 19:26.931
Talking is definitely better.

19:27.051 --> 19:27.422
Yeah.

19:28.755 --> 19:29.766
Thanks Jess.

19:29.886 --> 19:30.379
Okay.

19:32.737 --> 19:33.368
You're right.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.458
Forgot something.

19:55.393 --> 19:56.834
Popping up to see Connor?

19:57.677 --> 19:58.228
Yeah.

20:04.512 --> 20:07.243
Look Abby, some friendly advice.

20:08.422 --> 20:12.728
Unless you have more faith in Connor,
you're going to lose him.

20:13.127 --> 20:14.138
Wow!

20:15.678 --> 20:17.394
Friendly advice, eh?

20:20.597 --> 20:22.391
You have to let him work.

20:23.128 --> 20:26.377
What he's doing is too important.
He can't be distracted.

20:26.806 --> 20:28.630
I'm his girlfriend not a distraction.

20:31.045 --> 20:33.757
Maybe you should concentrate
on your own job Abby.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.324
You do like your job...
don't you?

20:49.311 --> 20:50.491
Thanks for the advice April.

20:51.422 --> 20:52.694
Just looking out for you.

20:52.814 --> 20:53.138
Yeah.

20:53.782 --> 20:56.219
I'd hate to see you make
a serious mistake.

21:08.998 --> 21:12.323
Jess. You know I'd never do anything
to get you into trouble don't you.

21:13.902 --> 21:15.955
Give me a couple of minutes
alone with the computers.

21:17.935 --> 21:19.988
Do you promise me I won't
regret it?

21:20.108 --> 21:20.785
Um-huh.

21:22.793 --> 21:24.034
Ok, I'll be back in five.

22:11.835 --> 22:12.954
Henry please.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.436
There are things you do not
understand.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.086
Hum?

22:23.220 --> 22:26.438
And you still refuse to offer any
explanation for where you went.

22:26.558 --> 22:28.346
Because I have no memory of it.

22:30.425 --> 22:31.988
Were you with that man?

22:39.674 --> 22:41.860
I see the answer all over
your face.

22:44.067 --> 22:45.814
I am a faithful wife Henry.

22:47.614 --> 22:49.055
Well even if that were true

22:49.745 --> 22:53.242
you've lost all sense of your place
since your return.

22:53.884 --> 22:56.919
Your ideas on how a woman
should behave are...

22:57.792 --> 22:58.834
disturbing.

22:59.631 --> 23:03.647
I agree I am not the person you
married but I am <i>not</i> insane.

23:03.767 --> 23:04.444
No?

23:07.335 --> 23:08.959
Well then why are you dressed
like that?

23:14.291 --> 23:15.104
See what that is.

23:15.224 --> 23:15.732
What?

23:16.115 --> 23:16.759
Why me?

23:28.648 --> 23:30.901
Henry I know what's out there.
It's a creature.

23:31.021 --> 23:33.966
It's the thing their calling Spring-
heeled Jack. I can protect you.

23:34.086 --> 23:35.943
- I can kill it, please!
- Are you really mad?

23:36.063 --> 23:37.702
There is no monster.

23:41.684 --> 23:42.315
Oh!

24:11.945 --> 24:12.956
Henry.

24:35.222 --> 24:36.126
Emily.

24:39.427 --> 24:41.511
I command you to stay
where you are.

24:44.502 --> 24:47.000
You'll thank me for
it later.

25:26.243 --> 25:27.362
You all right?

25:27.852 --> 25:29.002
Do you need any help?

25:30.490 --> 25:31.685
Spring-heeled Jack.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.386
Spring-heeled Jack!

25:33.506 --> 25:35.900
Spring-heeled Jack. He's
killed again.

25:37.417 --> 25:38.091
Emily

25:38.628 --> 25:39.317
Hey.

25:43.860 --> 25:44.764
Where's the raptor?

25:44.884 --> 25:46.646
We should go back to it's
nest, wait for it there.

25:46.766 --> 25:48.074
No we need to find it right now.

25:48.194 --> 25:50.465
You're in my time now Matt.
We do this my way.

25:50.585 --> 25:52.197
- Come on.
- All right.

26:14.391 --> 26:15.785
Murderers.

26:27.733 --> 26:30.354
Abby you okay? Everything all
right with the anomaly?

26:30.474 --> 26:33.033
Fine. All under control.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.313
I was wondering if you had five
minutes for a chat?

26:38.520 --> 26:39.608
If you're not too busy.

26:40.068 --> 26:42.014
Yeah, no, of course I'll

26:42.728 --> 26:44.582
- See you in a second.
- Great.

27:33.775 --> 27:34.924
Come on.

27:47.618 --> 27:48.415
Hey.

27:49.488 --> 27:53.350
Sorry. I got held up. Just
give us a couple of minutes.

27:53.470 --> 27:56.570
Yep. Cool. I'll-I'll stay here.

27:56.690 --> 27:57.137
Okay.

28:02.659 --> 28:03.502
Come on.

28:09.987 --> 28:12.332
- That was quick.
- Why aren't you in the lab?

28:13.221 --> 28:15.597
Oh, I was just, um, waiting
for Abby.

28:15.964 --> 28:17.451
She-She wanted to...

28:19.665 --> 28:20.799
Okay.

28:22.148 --> 28:23.083
Come on.

28:28.241 --> 28:29.344
April.

28:30.586 --> 28:32.088
You... You`re just gonna ignore me?

28:35.092 --> 28:37.084
April what on earth's the matter?

28:49.904 --> 28:52.540
We only left the room for, like,
a couple of minutes.

28:59.532 --> 29:00.176
No.

29:00.819 --> 29:02.137
You're right, sorry.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.681
Just a bit nervous that's all.

29:04.988 --> 29:06.153
Big day.

29:06.273 --> 29:10.060
Yeah, I suppose. So um.. shall we
do this then, you want to try and fix it.

29:10.180 --> 29:10.995
Let's

29:30.496 --> 29:33.408
Your EMD must be here somewhere.

29:36.378 --> 29:37.330
Come on men, this way.

29:55.223 --> 29:56.235
Lose the cloak.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.434
Dressed like Jack,
you'll hang for certain.

30:00.844 --> 30:02.208
Three in there.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.686
Quick let's split up.

30:12.601 --> 30:13.981
Move, go, go, go.

30:14.101 --> 30:15.207
Two in there.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.772
Hey... use that.

31:09.037 --> 31:09.926
Hey!

31:14.889 --> 31:17.377
Through here.

31:41.708 --> 31:45.540
Just softened him up for you. We need to
get the raptor back through the anomaly.

31:45.660 --> 31:47.026
We can't leave it here.

31:47.494 --> 31:48.212
Come on.

32:13.116 --> 32:14.265
Okay.

32:15.616 --> 32:16.827
Here's good.

32:19.401 --> 32:20.827
- Give him a push.
- Emily.

32:20.947 --> 32:23.309
- One, two...
- I want you to come back with me.

32:25.293 --> 32:26.136
three.

32:42.311 --> 32:43.843
Okay go.

32:50.558 --> 32:52.244
Emily I mean it.

32:52.364 --> 32:54.329
You might have been born here
you don't belong here anymore.

32:54.865 --> 32:58.344
Matt I won't end up in the asylum.
I can look after myself.

32:58.464 --> 33:00.398
I'll leave here, travel abroad.

33:00.518 --> 33:02.620
Come with me...
to the Arc.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.219
That's where you belong
now Emily.

33:06.395 --> 33:10.120
This is my home,
and you have your own commitments.

33:15.103 --> 33:16.145
I was wrong...

33:17.034 --> 33:18.444
to tell you to come back here.

33:20.298 --> 33:21.601
I've really missed you.

33:24.121 --> 33:25.559
And I you.

33:31.368 --> 33:32.854
Good-bye Matt.

34:03.096 --> 34:04.161
Stop there.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.427
You're a murderer, and an
adulteress.

34:11.542 --> 34:13.411
You will account for your crime.

34:14.991 --> 34:16.385
Don't move.

34:18.389 --> 34:19.600
I will fire.

34:21.347 --> 34:22.404
I will shot.

34:22.524 --> 34:23.309
No.

34:27.922 --> 34:28.751
Matt

34:29.027 --> 34:29.916
Matt...

34:30.958 --> 34:31.878
I'm shot.

34:31.998 --> 34:33.134
I'll get the medical kit.

34:35.915 --> 34:38.428
There's no blood. There's
no blood?

34:46.215 --> 34:47.257
There's no wound.

34:51.195 --> 34:52.498
Your outfit saved you.

34:55.853 --> 34:56.483
Matt.

34:57.407 --> 34:59.323
Neither of you move or I will
kill him.

34:59.443 --> 35:01.116
Put the gun down and we'll
let you go home.

35:01.236 --> 35:01.867
Get up.

35:03.859 --> 35:04.718
Now!

35:08.723 --> 35:10.960
I'm not going anywhere without
my wife.

35:12.202 --> 35:13.949
She will pay for her crimes.

35:14.069 --> 35:15.795
I didn't kill anyone Henry.

35:17.021 --> 35:19.486
And I'm not your wife, not
anymore.

35:20.211 --> 35:21.805
And I'm not coming back
with you.

35:22.249 --> 35:24.241
- This is my home now.
- Enough.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.340
Get to your feet woman.

35:30.076 --> 35:32.482
Now! Or your lover dies.

35:43.545 --> 35:44.863
What is this place?

35:46.503 --> 35:47.361
You.

35:48.546 --> 35:50.140
How are you doing this?

35:51.259 --> 35:53.190
- You have mesmerized me.
- Henry...

35:53.442 --> 35:55.680
Put the gun down please.

35:56.048 --> 35:58.040
No one here means you any harm.

36:00.063 --> 36:01.274
Look out behind you.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.266
No! Stay where you are.

36:21.032 --> 36:21.982
He's dead.

36:42.562 --> 36:44.202
Connor what's wrong?

36:45.673 --> 36:46.669
Nothing, I just...

36:48.110 --> 36:51.129
I don't know what's happened to Abby.
I think I'm going to give her a quick call.

36:51.249 --> 36:52.895
Connor sorry but...

36:53.799 --> 36:55.883
I don't think she was ever
going to show up.

36:57.079 --> 36:58.719
What-What do you mean?

36:59.485 --> 37:01.523
She's playing mind games
with you Connor.

37:03.279 --> 37:05.532
Mind- She's not playing
mind games.

37:06.175 --> 37:08.091
She'd never do anything
like that.

37:08.964 --> 37:11.953
What you see is what you get
with Abby. Okay?

37:14.179 --> 37:15.895
I'm gonna take a breather.

37:16.370 --> 37:18.547
Conner I didn't mean to...

37:19.451 --> 37:20.386
It's fine.

37:23.577 --> 37:26.443
Look. I think we should let all
this system warm up first.

37:27.224 --> 37:30.581
Maybe that was the problem before.
The coils weren't quite ready or something.

37:31.456 --> 37:32.757
Buy me a coffee?

37:33.188 --> 37:33.862
Cool.

37:52.195 --> 37:53.221
What are you doing.

37:55.520 --> 37:56.440
Nothing.

37:57.375 --> 37:57.972
Um...

37:58.356 --> 37:59.888
Are you trying to get in there.

38:02.268 --> 38:03.540
What the hell Abby?

38:04.353 --> 38:07.265
You spying on me now? You
really hate Philip that much do you?

38:07.385 --> 38:09.870
No. Connor, listen.

38:12.322 --> 38:13.441
He's dangerous.

38:14.284 --> 38:15.556
Really dangerous.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.583
I know things.

38:21.995 --> 38:22.853
Okay.

38:24.034 --> 38:25.781
I can tell you but we can't
talk here.

38:26.991 --> 38:28.355
What's with the secrets?

38:29.233 --> 38:31.272
When Danny was here he
spoke to Matt.

38:32.068 --> 38:34.858
He found a connection between
Helen and Philip.

38:37.065 --> 38:38.582
They knew each other Connor.

38:39.704 --> 38:40.608
I know.

38:43.091 --> 38:43.872
Sorry.

38:44.118 --> 38:46.570
I know. Philip told me.

38:47.951 --> 38:51.277
Philip said that when Danny was in the riff
valley he found some papers in Helens'

38:51.397 --> 38:52.825
bag with his name on it.

38:53.952 --> 38:55.775
That doesn't prove anything.

38:55.895 --> 38:56.879
Of course it does.

38:58.181 --> 38:59.821
They were in league with
each other somehow.

39:00.082 --> 39:02.166
No... they weren't.

39:02.615 --> 39:07.074
Philip is one of the most famous scientist
in the world and Helen knew his name.

39:07.702 --> 39:10.675
It doesn't mean anything.

39:15.246 --> 39:17.116
I don't get why you don't...

39:18.312 --> 39:20.503
Is that it or have you got
more proof

39:20.787 --> 39:22.917
that Philip's some kind of
super villain?

39:24.404 --> 39:25.047
Oh.

39:28.833 --> 39:30.442
What's happening to us?

39:34.891 --> 39:35.903
I don't know.

39:39.167 --> 39:41.114
But I know I've got work to do.

39:53.643 --> 39:55.283
Oh my God. Emily.

39:55.973 --> 39:58.946
- I always knew you'd be back.
- You knew more than me?

39:59.656 --> 40:01.603
So you just went back
for the Raptor, yeah.

40:01.723 --> 40:04.070
You're never allowed to go
anywhere else again, ever.

40:04.190 --> 40:05.695
It's good to see you too.

40:05.815 --> 40:06.400
Come.

40:30.743 --> 40:31.708
Hey.

40:42.857 --> 40:43.838
Wow.

40:46.060 --> 40:47.271
Thank you.

40:52.614 --> 40:56.215
Abby... someday he will
understand.

40:57.702 --> 40:59.403
I'm not so sure about that.

41:18.616 --> 41:20.762
- Is everything ok?
- Yeah.

41:23.629 --> 41:25.223
Yeah, it's gonna work this time.

41:58.237 --> 42:01.057
Philip. We did it.

42:01.823 --> 42:03.325
We made history.

42:10.719 --> 42:12.527
Nothing's gonna be the same again.
