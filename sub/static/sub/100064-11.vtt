WEBVTT

00:09.042 --> 00:10.110
She's with us now.

00:10.143 --> 00:12.412
Hansen's doing a wonderful job.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.547
Well done.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.583
And I will send you to a place
unaffected by vampires.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.018
That doesn't exist.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.220
Who do you think is watching?

00:20.254 --> 00:23.590
I was made in order to betray
all I held dear.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.125
Not anymore.

00:25.158 --> 00:26.994
What treachery is this?!

00:27.027 --> 00:28.161
Ah!

00:29.463 --> 00:31.465
No!!!!

00:45.646 --> 00:49.516
[laboured breathing]

00:52.653 --> 00:57.291
You know how to open the portal
to the Dark Realm.

00:57.324 --> 01:02.663
You have Abraham's instructions

01:02.696 --> 01:04.731
Lead us to that hiding place.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.100
No!

01:07.134 --> 01:10.203
We must free our beloved.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.371
Show us!

01:11.405 --> 01:13.674
Take us to the hidden pages.

01:14.508 --> 01:17.210
No... No!

01:21.281 --> 01:25.652
For the last time, I will
not betray my children!

01:25.686 --> 01:27.721
No matter the cost.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.528
The cost will be your mind,
dear Willem.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.664
We will ransack your memories
until we find the truth.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.333
You've brought us this far.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.134
Lead us to the Van Helsing's
secret.

01:41.168 --> 01:43.470
Show us where you've hidden them
all these years.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.771
Be done with the pain

01:44.805 --> 01:46.039
[cries out]

01:47.307 --> 01:51.745
Every step in the right
direction will lessen
your agony.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.280
[gasps]

01:53.313 --> 01:55.482
Yes, much better.

01:56.883 --> 01:58.385
[laughs]

01:58.418 --> 01:59.219
See?

01:59.252 --> 02:01.121
Obedience has its rewards.

02:01.154 --> 02:02.990
[cries out]

02:03.624 --> 02:04.524
No!

02:04.558 --> 02:05.592
I will not!

02:05.626 --> 02:07.361
You have no choice.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.629
Your mind is ours.

02:08.662 --> 02:09.696
Lead us!

02:09.730 --> 02:11.531
Be gone!

02:11.565 --> 02:13.433
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!

02:17.404 --> 02:22.109
[laughing]

02:22.142 --> 02:27.881
You failed again,
you pathetic old hags.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.650
[roar]

02:29.683 --> 02:31.251
You dare to insult me!

02:31.284 --> 02:32.085
No!

02:32.119 --> 02:32.886
You must not!

02:32.919 --> 02:35.288
Strike while you can,
Michaela.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.891
Why give her another chance
to betray you?

02:37.924 --> 02:40.460
I know we've had our differences
in the past, Michaela,

02:40.494 --> 02:43.630
but we share a love,
a devotion, do we not?

02:43.664 --> 02:47.200
Our quest to raise our beloved
must forge us as one.

02:47.234 --> 02:50.170
I crave the return of the Dark
One with every drop of blood

02:50.203 --> 02:51.471
in my darkened soul.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.573
Yes, I know you do.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.742
So stay here,
gather your strength,

02:55.776 --> 02:58.245
purge his impurities!

02:58.278 --> 02:59.446
And you?

02:59.479 --> 03:00.614
Where will you go?

03:00.647 --> 03:04.818
I will smuggle the retch
back into his human fortress,

03:04.851 --> 03:07.154
dig deeper into
his weakened mind,

03:07.187 --> 03:08.355
for the pages.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.425
I will keep my secret
to my death.

03:11.458 --> 03:15.395
I will not fail my children.

03:19.533 --> 03:22.135
Oh, you will fail.

03:22.169 --> 03:25.605
And you will beg me for death
but there will be no end.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.443
Long after you've betrayed
your Van Helsing bastards

03:29.476 --> 03:31.478
you will suffer!

03:37.984 --> 03:45.158
[Bathory laughing as Hanson
cries out in pain]

03:54.634 --> 03:56.503
[grunts]

03:58.271 --> 03:59.172
You'd think after days
on the road

03:59.206 --> 04:01.475
they'd have their shit
sorted out by now.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.410
No doubt they're Van Helsings.

04:03.443 --> 04:05.612
Yes, they are.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.183
What's the matter, big fella?

04:10.217 --> 04:11.184
You got something on your mind?

04:11.218 --> 04:15.489
Other than the obvious
shit show that we're in.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.491
You think there's a real world
out there

04:17.524 --> 04:18.558
besides this shit show?

04:18.592 --> 04:20.861
What, you mean that vampires
haven't got to yet?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.263
I mean, that Darius asshole,
he could be lying.

04:23.296 --> 04:25.532
He was broadcasting
to someone, somewhere.

04:25.565 --> 04:26.867
Yeah, but where?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.368
Over the mountains?

04:28.401 --> 04:30.437
Over the ocean?

04:30.470 --> 04:31.671
Either way, they ain't
gonna deal with that

04:31.705 --> 04:35.408
'till they get the job
done here.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.676
[sighs]
Christ, Axel.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.779
They're just kids.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.014
I've been alive
for over 100 years.

04:41.047 --> 04:45.218
I'm lucky I still have my head.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.454
But them?

04:47.487 --> 04:49.589
How are they gonna do this?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.626
They have what Vanessa has.

04:52.659 --> 04:56.429
What Scarlett had.

04:56.463 --> 05:00.267
Lay it all out on a line,
win or lose.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.904
I know you don't trust Dad

05:03.937 --> 05:07.474
and you have every right
to have your doubts.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.543
He's a vampire, Jack.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.044
I saw it with my own eyes.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.779
Then why did he save you?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
Did he?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.715
Did he, or did I just get away?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.751
He saved you.

05:17.784 --> 05:20.287
I was supposed to bring
you back alive

05:20.320 --> 05:24.658
so that they could torture her
and find out what you knew.

05:24.691 --> 05:26.760
But I was the one that figured
out it was all a trap.

05:26.793 --> 05:29.729
Dad was the one that sent
you the clues about the pages.

05:29.763 --> 05:33.466
Why would he do that if he
didn't think you'd get away?

05:34.301 --> 05:37.304
Ivory just said they were gonna
torture you to get answers.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.575
What do you think they're
doing to him right now?

05:41.608 --> 05:43.310
Then we have to go back
to Fort Collins

05:43.343 --> 05:45.745
and find the pages
before he tells them.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.747
And let them kill Dad?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.282
I'm not gonna let
that happen, okay?

05:49.316 --> 05:49.850
I'm going back.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.619
I just found you.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.755
I can't let Dad suffer.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.757
I know you can't, either.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.795
I can go with her.

06:01.828 --> 06:05.599
I know a way in,
past the guards.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.500
I mean, it's the least I can do

06:07.534 --> 06:09.669
after everything you've done
for me.

06:11.571 --> 06:13.940
Don't risk yourself.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.809
I'll see you soon.

06:20.480 --> 06:20.981
Oh, here you go.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.049
That's a good sign.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.718
Come on, let's go!

06:24.751 --> 06:27.420
I wanna get there before dark!

06:33.927 --> 06:35.729
What's this?

06:35.762 --> 06:38.732
Where's your sister going
with Ivory?

06:38.765 --> 06:41.434
To save our so‐called father.

06:41.468 --> 06:43.136
Let's go.

06:43.169 --> 06:44.938
Come on.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.981
Do as you wish, Bathory.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.651
Your spells may
keep me powerless

06:57.684 --> 07:00.820
but I will keep the secret
for my children 'til the end.

07:00.854 --> 07:04.090
Their love sustains me.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.725
[laughs]

07:05.759 --> 07:08.662
You kept your secret from me.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.931
I don't want anything to do
with you.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.699
Why would I?

07:12.732 --> 07:14.868
You never loved me.

07:14.901 --> 07:15.802
Or my sister!

07:15.835 --> 07:17.404
No, that's not true.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.506
I loved you both dearly.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.408
You are still loyal
to the Dark One.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.375
No.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.009
You will always be!

07:23.043 --> 07:23.944
No.

07:23.977 --> 07:24.945
No!

07:24.978 --> 07:26.212
I know love.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.916
I love my children and there's
nothing that can change that.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.685
Love us?

07:31.718 --> 07:34.020
You made us to hand us
over to the Dark One.

07:34.054 --> 07:34.854
No.

07:34.888 --> 07:35.755
As a trophy.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.523
No.

07:36.556 --> 07:37.691
As a blood sacrifice!

07:37.724 --> 07:41.428
No, no, no, no!

07:41.461 --> 07:44.130
See? More lies.

07:44.164 --> 07:49.903
You don't even look like the
man who said he was our dad.

07:49.936 --> 07:55.875
Everything about you is a lie.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.610
No.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.913
Not all, Violet.

07:59.946 --> 08:04.884
One day I'll tell you and Jack
how I came to love you.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.721
Don't bother.

08:17.597 --> 08:21.935
Seeing you suffer
is all I need.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.437
Even your crude imitation
of Violet,

08:24.471 --> 08:26.239
it soothes my soul.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.041
It strengthens my resolve.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.776
[growls]

08:31.544 --> 08:35.148
I know all about your children,
Willem.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.918
That they are special.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.021
But if you pit them
against the Dark One

08:41.054 --> 08:42.989
you know they will fail.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.125
And I will bend them
to her will.

08:45.158 --> 08:49.029
They're not as weak
as you believe.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.732
If you harm them I will bring
the sky down on you.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.767
I will move heaven
and earth‐

08:53.800 --> 08:55.101
Silence!

09:00.507 --> 09:06.146
[helicopter whirring]

09:17.891 --> 09:21.127
Looks like something
is happening down there.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.796
Are those soldiers?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.697
They sure are.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.799
It's hard to tell
from the insignias

09:25.832 --> 09:27.700
but they look American.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.235
Some kind of special ops.

09:29.269 --> 09:30.570
Small but deadly.

09:30.603 --> 09:32.639
So Darius was telling the truth.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.908
There's a world out there where
humans are still in charge.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.176
Yeah.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.677
American humans.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.679
Sometimes a general
would show up.

09:39.712 --> 09:41.714
Avery would come with soldiers.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.650
That is, before she got
ripped to shreds.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.851
Where would they come from?

09:44.884 --> 09:45.819
Dad wouldn't say.

09:45.852 --> 09:48.088
None of them would,
it was all classified.

09:48.121 --> 09:53.159
So this is some kind
of central command.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.861
Or it's just another base,
but...

09:54.894 --> 09:58.031
Well, wherever they're from,
we gotta get past them.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.833
We can worry about the rest
of the world later.

09:59.866 --> 10:00.967
Everyone knows you, Vi.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.169
And some know me.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.939
Okay, so we go over the fence.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.207
Sneak through town.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.109
These are not Blak Tek guards,
they're gonna set a perimeter.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.811
Tube socks will not work
on them.

10:38.671 --> 10:39.739
Hello there.

10:39.772 --> 10:43.243
Excuse my surprise but I wasn't
expecting visitors.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.211
I'm Avery.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.913
We've met.

10:46.946 --> 10:48.281
I was on the advisory team
that briefed you

10:48.314 --> 10:50.250
before you were sent
to Fort Collins.

10:50.283 --> 10:50.950
Of course.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.153
I'm sorry, Colonel Nicholson.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.321
There's been a lot
going on here.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.422
So much unfolding.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.125
It's been several weeks
since you last made contact.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.594
You were supposed to provide
us with a more detailed update.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.229
Where's Hansen?

11:03.263 --> 11:06.166
He's been missing
for some time now.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.768
I suspect he's left
the base entirely.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.603
Then we need to find him.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.238
There's a lot he needs
to explain.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.741
He's more elusive
than you might imagine,

11:14.774 --> 11:15.708
and a liar.

11:15.742 --> 11:18.411
He's a wolf in sheep's clothing,
as it were.

11:18.444 --> 11:20.914
Last contact you reported
everything was fine.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.315
Until it wasn't.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.784
I'm just glad you showed up.

11:29.055 --> 11:31.824
What can you tell me
about those people?

11:31.858 --> 11:36.196
Um, Hansen's two daughters,
their bodyguard of sorts.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.830
Could be travelling together.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.399
And the woman?

11:40.900 --> 11:45.905
I don't know her, but
she appears treacherous.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.945
What is it about them
that interests you?

11:51.978 --> 11:53.446
We're also looking for
an abandoned hotel

11:53.479 --> 11:55.014
that's nearby here.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.984
Somewhere these suspects
might still be.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.053
Any idea where that is?

12:00.086 --> 12:02.188
I'm sure I could be vastly
more helpful

12:02.222 --> 12:03.122
if you just told me everything.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.958
Above your security clearance.

12:04.991 --> 12:06.192
Classified.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.361
Presidential order.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.429
The president?

12:09.462 --> 12:11.831
What I can tell you is I plan
to retrieve Hansen

12:11.864 --> 12:13.967
and his children,
along with any intelligence

12:14.000 --> 12:17.170
I deem relevant and I expect
your full cooperation.

12:17.203 --> 12:17.904
Of course.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.739
Anything I can offer.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.307
But in terms of
the president‐

12:21.341 --> 12:22.508
Sorry to interrupt, Colonel.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.711
The Chief of Staff
is on the SAT phone.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.279
Excuse me.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.792
[grunts]

12:49.836 --> 12:52.372
Mira, the time is nigh...

12:52.405 --> 12:54.474
I have sensed the loss
of Ivory.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.380
Because of this I have chosen
you to be adjutant

13:00.413 --> 13:02.415
to your mother.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.854
Kneel, my child.

13:14.894 --> 13:20.099
I release you from your vow
of silence.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.668
Thank you, Mother.

13:21.701 --> 13:22.769
Rise now.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.604
It is time.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.741
Are you certain this
is the right path?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.577
Bathory has veiled intent,
Mira.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.547
This is the only way to ensure
my safety.

13:34.580 --> 13:38.217
A snake draped in gold
is still a snake.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.087
We should remove its head.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.288
In due time.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.724
Once we have achieved our
objective and the Dark One

13:44.757 --> 13:50.530
is again by my side, then there
will be a reckoning.

14:16.589 --> 14:30.770
[chanting]

14:30.803 --> 14:35.541
[chanting]

14:35.575 --> 14:37.443
[whispering] I don't see him.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.812
Is there anywhere else
they would be keeping him?

14:39.846 --> 14:40.513
No.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.816
This is where he would be held.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.318
What're they doing?

14:45.351 --> 14:47.353
It's a setite ceremony.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.823
It's a ritual to remove
her heart.

14:50.857 --> 14:51.991
Wouldn't that kill her?

14:52.024 --> 14:52.658
No.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.228
Not if it's done correctly.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.262
When going into battle,

14:56.295 --> 14:58.197
ancient vampires used to remove
their hearts

14:58.231 --> 15:00.967
to protect themselves
from being staked.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.202
(Jack) Some party trick.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.640
I've seen enough.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.342
Where are you going?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.210
Back to Fort Collins.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.645
Maybe they took him back there.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.313
Don't you see?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.382
We have an opportunity.

15:19.786 --> 15:29.829
[chanting]

15:44.911 --> 15:45.812
[coughing]

15:45.845 --> 15:50.016
Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
It's okay.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.251
[chanting continues]

15:55.054 --> 15:56.255
Ivory!

15:59.592 --> 16:02.428
Okay, you have to help us

16:02.462 --> 16:04.931
to kill Michaela
and free the others.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.399
But she's so powerful.

16:06.432 --> 16:07.967
It's okay, we're going to strike

16:07.967 --> 16:11.304
at her most vulnerable
moment, okay?

16:11.337 --> 16:13.039
Now go back to your duties.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.741
You'll know when the time
is right.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.579
Okay.

16:19.612 --> 16:20.646
Okay, go.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.615
Go, go, go.

16:29.856 --> 16:37.930
[chanting continues]

16:46.339 --> 16:56.382
[chanting]

16:56.415 --> 17:00.920
[screaming]

17:00.953 --> 17:06.492
[laughing]

17:14.000 --> 17:19.071
[laughing]

17:21.140 --> 17:22.341
Yes.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.681
Bring me sustenance
to give me strength.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.131
[cup shatters]

17:46.599 --> 17:48.100
You fool!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.669
Traitors!

17:51.704 --> 17:53.005
Protect my heart!

17:53.039 --> 17:56.042
[fighting grunts]

18:06.052 --> 18:07.053
Ugh!

18:07.520 --> 18:10.723
[fighting grunts]

18:16.195 --> 18:19.298
[fighting grunts]

18:24.570 --> 18:27.573
You're gonna pay for what
you did to my sisters.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.076
And what you did to me!!!!

18:30.109 --> 18:34.580
[fighting grunts]

18:34.614 --> 18:41.821
[choking]

18:45.891 --> 18:48.728
You are nothing but a fawn
captured by wolves.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.863
I should have let you burn
at the stake.

18:50.896 --> 18:53.065
You don't know what
pain and suffering is,

18:53.099 --> 18:54.934
but you will.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.771
[growls]

19:21.527 --> 19:24.196
This is for my sisters.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.600
[gasps]

19:28.668 --> 19:32.238
A new development.

19:32.271 --> 19:38.611
A thorn in my paw removed
by mice.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.646
But what now?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.086
Stillness.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.555
Yes.

19:52.158 --> 19:57.663
Stillness is the way.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.833
[laughs]

20:00.866 --> 20:05.004
Stillness, and the world
is ours.

20:08.207 --> 20:13.145
The veil of darkness,
it's been lifted forever.

20:13.179 --> 20:18.117
Sisters, we owe a great
gratitude to the Van Helsings.

20:18.150 --> 20:22.788
We have to help them do whatever
it takes to defeat the Dark One.

20:22.822 --> 20:24.156
To our Sisterhood!

20:24.190 --> 20:26.158
(All) To our Sisterhood!

20:31.363 --> 20:33.866
Do you know where the Oracle
took my dad?

20:33.899 --> 20:35.134
Hansen.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.535
Was it Fort Collins?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.269
Yes.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.471
To continue to carve his mind

20:38.504 --> 20:41.974
searching for secrets he has
concealed for centuries.

20:42.007 --> 20:43.876
I have to save him.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.045
I wish to go with you.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.813
To protect you.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.549
I mean, I‐ I owe you
a great debt.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.152
You don't owe me anything.

20:53.185 --> 20:57.656
But I'd be happy if you came
with me.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.060
[laugh]

21:27.086 --> 21:28.454
[clears throat]

21:28.487 --> 21:31.724
Old gate, new faces, huh?

21:31.757 --> 21:33.926
Step out of the vehicle.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.162
Okay.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.669
You boys have a bit of
a situation here?

21:46.071 --> 21:48.674
You seen any of these people
out there?

21:51.577 --> 21:57.750
Uh... no, none of these guys
are ringin' any bells.

21:57.783 --> 21:59.652
Why? Is there a reward if I do?

21:59.685 --> 22:01.720
Open the back of the truck.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.991
Y'all are special forces, huh?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.661
You spend any time
in Afghanistan?

22:08.694 --> 22:09.829
I did a couple tours.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.064
The back of the truck, sir.

22:12.097 --> 22:13.299
It's Sergeant, actually.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.201
Sergeant Axel Miller.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.636
308th.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.306
I was in Kabul first,
then Kamdesh.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.842
I'm not gonna ask you again.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.743
The back of the truck.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.817
You sure I couldn't offer you
some bourbon instead?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.285
No, no, no, no, I get it.

22:33.319 --> 22:34.954
All right.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.890
Your funeral.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.930
[coughing]

22:44.964 --> 22:45.798
Jesus Christ!

22:45.831 --> 22:47.833
What the is that?!

22:47.867 --> 22:54.607
It's uh, shoes and clothes that
I got off some dead people.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.841
Just business, man.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.244
I take it to Low Town, I trade
it with a dude there,

22:58.277 --> 22:59.111
he gives me some whiskey...

22:59.144 --> 23:00.779
[coughing]

23:00.813 --> 23:02.681
I bring it out in the world
and I uh, you know,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.784
I trade it out there.

23:05.818 --> 23:08.320
But if you want
to confiscate it...

23:08.354 --> 23:09.688
[coughing]

23:09.722 --> 23:10.956
Be my guest.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.291
Plenty more where
that came from.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.292
[coughing]

23:13.325 --> 23:14.727
For Christ's sake,
get this shit outta here.

23:14.760 --> 23:15.794
You sure?

23:15.828 --> 23:18.130
[coughing]

23:18.931 --> 23:20.266
All right.

23:23.702 --> 23:24.937
[coughing]

23:33.679 --> 23:34.847
Let him through.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.650
You guys are both wanted.

23:37.683 --> 23:39.251
Gotta keep a low profile.

23:39.285 --> 23:41.053
And you?

23:41.086 --> 23:43.122
I'm not on their radar yet.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.693
Okay, so what now?

23:47.726 --> 23:50.029
We break into the compound,
get to my dad's office,

23:50.062 --> 23:51.196
and I get the pages.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.665
Without getting caught.

23:52.698 --> 23:54.033
I've still got this.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.067
I'm stealthy as shit.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.168
Done it a hundred times.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.903
Yeah, I'm not letting you go
in there by yourself.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.705
Well, it's easier than you
coming with me.

23:59.738 --> 24:00.739
How's that gonna work?

24:00.773 --> 24:01.607
I'm coming, too.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.108
I gotta find out what happened
to Doc.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.743
Julius, you're six foot six.

24:04.777 --> 24:05.744
You're wanted all over town.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.047
Okay, with or without you two,
I'm going in.

24:08.080 --> 24:08.847
Tonight.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.751
Maybe we're thinking about
this the wrong way.

24:12.785 --> 24:16.388
Maybe it's part stealth and‐

24:16.422 --> 24:18.891
and part... giving them
what they want.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.396
Hey!

24:25.230 --> 24:26.198
Stop right there!

24:26.231 --> 24:27.199
Drop your weapon!

24:28.133 --> 24:29.168
You gotta be kidding me.

24:29.201 --> 24:31.737
This is the guy that you're
all looking for, right?

24:31.770 --> 24:33.038
Some kind of bounty
on his head?

24:33.072 --> 24:34.306
I'm gonna kill you
if you come any closer!

24:34.340 --> 24:35.274
How's that?

24:35.307 --> 24:35.874
Try it!

24:35.908 --> 24:37.242
Radio for back‐up!

24:38.944 --> 24:41.246
I said drop your weapon!

24:41.280 --> 24:43.115
Unit problem to
the north entrance.

24:43.148 --> 24:43.882
At the north entrance.

24:43.916 --> 24:44.917
Let's go.

24:44.950 --> 24:45.651
On the double!

24:45.684 --> 24:47.853
Come on, let's go,
go, go...

24:47.886 --> 24:48.954
Hurry!

24:48.988 --> 24:50.189
Move it!

24:57.930 --> 24:59.965
There's a reward for this man!

24:59.999 --> 25:01.433
I'm not just gonna hand
him over to you.

25:01.467 --> 25:02.735
Drop your weapon!

25:02.768 --> 25:05.004
This is your final warning!

25:08.140 --> 25:09.842
[charging roars]

25:09.875 --> 25:12.144
[gunshots]

25:14.713 --> 25:16.849
You gotta be shitting me!

25:16.882 --> 25:18.317
What's the matter with you?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.453
The BOLO said alive!

25:21.487 --> 25:23.622
Secure this door.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.159
What the hell is this?

25:27.192 --> 25:28.460
Drop that weapon!

25:28.494 --> 25:29.762
Okay, okay, okay.

25:29.795 --> 25:31.130
Everybody just calm down.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.297
Put your gun down slowly.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.265
Put your gun on the ground.

25:33.298 --> 25:34.333
No sudden moves.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.267
Easy!

25:35.300 --> 25:36.802
Keep those hands
where I can see them.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.137
Is this the man I was sent
to find?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.505
Is that who's lying
on my pavement?

25:39.538 --> 25:40.272
I'm sorry, sir!

25:40.305 --> 25:42.241
Sorry doesn't cut it!

25:44.176 --> 25:46.812
I wanted to question
that suspect, Corporal.

25:46.845 --> 25:47.846
Get rid of that body.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.914
Yes, sir.

25:58.357 --> 25:59.892
‐Come on, we gotta get
this body outta here.

25:59.925 --> 26:00.692
‐Could we get a hand here?

26:00.726 --> 26:02.327
‐We gotta get this body in.

26:02.361 --> 26:03.495
Take him down
to the morgue.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.030
‐Copy that Sarge.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.532
(Avery) Oh, my god.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.866
What's going on?

26:07.900 --> 26:08.901
I heard gunfire.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.035
Stay back, ma'am.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.003
Are we under attack?

26:11.036 --> 26:11.904
We're fine, ma'am.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.872
Just follow orders
and stand clear.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.872
(Bathory's voice) Stillness.

26:46.905 --> 26:53.145
The path forward
is still and clear.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.914
Now I expect focus.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.116
And discipline.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.117
You understand?

26:58.150 --> 26:59.118
Yes sir.

26:59.151 --> 26:59.985
And keep your eyes open
for others on that list.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.855
One showed up,
others might, too.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.857
Hey, wait‐ wait a second.
Sorry.

27:04.890 --> 27:05.390
What about my reward?

27:05.424 --> 27:06.258
Back off, now!

27:06.291 --> 27:07.192
No, no, no.

27:07.226 --> 27:09.261
He was alive when he got here,
so pay up.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.162
I'll give you a reward.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.431
You're being detained
for questioning.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.098
Questioning?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.099
No, no, no, no.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.367
Hey, this is bullshit.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.569
You and I are gonna have a chat

27:17.603 --> 27:21.273
about how you found
the dead guy and where.

27:21.306 --> 27:24.510
And how you got him
on my goddamn base.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.238
[exhales]

27:54.306 --> 27:55.307
[groans]

27:55.340 --> 27:56.775
Come on.

27:58.744 --> 28:01.613
[groans]

28:17.930 --> 28:24.269
[clock ticking]

28:43.789 --> 28:46.825
All available units
to the north entrance.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.452
Thank god.

29:13.485 --> 29:15.220
‐We need everyone
to regroup at C2.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.788
Fall back, fall back.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.590
‐Will do, right away.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.220
Jesus Christ.

29:48.253 --> 29:49.821
You think you can blame me
just because

29:49.855 --> 29:53.592
your glorified security guards
got trigger happy.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.228
You were dispatched to a
hospital in downtown Seattle

29:56.261 --> 29:57.929
the day of the rising.

29:57.963 --> 30:02.200
Isn't that right,
Sergeant Miller?

30:38.337 --> 30:39.871
[laughs]

30:39.905 --> 30:43.542
I told your guy at the gate.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.476
Name, rank, and unit.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.344
That's all you needed.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.713
Ran you through
the DOD database.

30:47.746 --> 30:48.647
Quite a service record.

30:48.680 --> 30:52.984
So there's still a real world
out there?

30:53.018 --> 30:54.820
Real military, anyway?

30:54.853 --> 30:57.889
You were left protecting
a very important asset.

30:57.923 --> 30:59.725
What can you tell me about that?

30:59.758 --> 31:01.793
Yeah, see, I always wondered
if you guys knew about her

31:01.827 --> 31:03.562
ahead of time.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.897
You sent us down there
on purpose.

31:05.931 --> 31:09.267
You wanna know about Vanessa?

31:16.875 --> 31:17.776
Code yellow...

31:20.912 --> 31:22.647
Copy that.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.586
These four.

31:27.619 --> 31:28.653
Were they travelling together

31:28.687 --> 31:31.823
when you caught the one who
was killed, Julius?

31:31.857 --> 31:36.561
I told ya, I nabbed him alone
right here in Low Town.

31:36.595 --> 31:42.033
Surprised your crack troops
didn't get to him before me.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.404
We're both military men here,
Sergeant,

31:45.437 --> 31:48.740
so why don't I just put
all my cards on the table?

31:48.774 --> 31:51.610
My men found that pink hotel,
all torn up,

31:51.643 --> 31:53.512
bodies everywhere.

31:53.545 --> 31:57.516
They just sent me
some images, too.

31:58.283 --> 32:02.854
Some things that didn't make
the television broadcast.

32:02.888 --> 32:05.657
There's that.

32:07.993 --> 32:12.531
So why don't we cut
the bullshit, huh?

32:12.564 --> 32:15.033
I wanna know where they are.

32:15.066 --> 32:19.471
Particularly that girl.

32:19.504 --> 32:20.505
Hansen's kid.

32:20.539 --> 32:22.974
You know, the one that can
turn a vampire human

32:23.008 --> 32:25.710
with just one bite.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.713
I wanna know why I look
so fat in that‐

32:28.747 --> 32:32.350
Tell me what I wanna know.

32:32.384 --> 32:34.619
Take your hands off me,
you army douche bag.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.589
Okay, hey, hey,
easy, easy, easy.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.424
We're all on the same team.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.959
Relax.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.394
That's where you're wrong.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.629
There's no team anymore.

32:44.663 --> 32:48.066
It's just you in my way.

32:54.105 --> 32:59.110
You wanna know about them?

32:59.144 --> 33:01.913
I'm not saying shit
with these guys here.

33:06.885 --> 33:07.919
Go.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.426
Okay.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.831
It's a long story.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.767
Might as well make
yourself comfortable.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.098
Sunshine Unit.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.957
Who are you?

34:52.457 --> 34:57.028
Violet... Violet,
I'm your father.

35:11.343 --> 35:13.378
How can you be my father?

35:13.411 --> 35:17.649
I know you have a lot
of questions, Violet.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.684
And I understand.

35:19.718 --> 35:25.156
But first you must tell me,

35:25.190 --> 35:30.028
did you see the clues
I sent in the vision?

35:30.061 --> 35:33.098
Did you find the painting?

35:33.131 --> 35:34.699
How do I know you're not
one of them?

35:34.733 --> 35:38.403
They can be anybody.

35:39.137 --> 35:44.509
Ask whatever you want
and I will answer.

35:44.542 --> 35:49.414
But you have to promise me
you'll take the pages and go.

35:49.447 --> 35:54.519
What did we do for
our 15th birthday?

35:54.552 --> 35:57.622
We went to the Midway.

35:57.656 --> 36:00.325
Out on the island.

36:01.292 --> 36:05.697
You loved the paddle boats.

36:05.730 --> 36:10.568
Jack liked the games.

36:10.602 --> 36:14.372
She won a trophy.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.408
No.

36:16.441 --> 36:20.211
She won a stuffed animal.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.380
A giraffe.

36:28.253 --> 36:32.257
[ragged breathing]

36:34.192 --> 36:36.227
You are my father.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.229
You are my father.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.765
Some‐ somehow you are.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.638
But how do I know
I can trust you?

36:49.441 --> 36:52.310
By leaving me here.

36:52.343 --> 36:54.446
Escaping with the pages.

36:54.479 --> 36:57.248
They're the key to everything.

36:59.517 --> 37:00.752
No.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.455
No, I'm not leaving
you here like this.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.789
With her.

37:05.190 --> 37:06.491
Just cut to the chase.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.159
Where is she now?

37:08.193 --> 37:09.394
Where is she now?

37:09.427 --> 37:12.530
Jesus Christ, I mean, that's
a‐ that's an even longer story.

37:12.564 --> 37:15.033
Why do I get the feeling that
you just like to keep me here,

37:15.066 --> 37:18.636
just listening to you ramble on
and on and on?

37:18.670 --> 37:20.772
I don't know, I guess I'm just
hard up for company.

37:20.805 --> 37:24.242
[scuffle outside]

37:24.509 --> 37:25.877
All right, hold still.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.613
You know how this goes
if you do anything stupid.

37:31.216 --> 37:32.383
You're smarter than you look.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.351
Hey buddy.

37:33.384 --> 37:34.452
Hey.

37:37.455 --> 37:39.457
Jesus Christ, you were dead.

37:39.491 --> 37:40.291
Yeah, it happens.

37:40.325 --> 37:42.627
Guess I didn't tell
you everything.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.862
You get what you need?

37:43.895 --> 37:45.363
Yeah.

37:45.396 --> 37:46.631
What now?

37:46.664 --> 37:47.532
We get out of here.

37:47.565 --> 37:50.769
How? With a gun to
the General's head?

37:50.802 --> 37:51.736
Colonel.

37:51.770 --> 37:52.971
Whatever.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.806
If you guys think that you're
just gonna march out of here

37:54.839 --> 37:58.710
with me as a hostage, you're
outta your goddamn minds.

38:06.351 --> 38:08.987
You want to know about Vanessa.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.589
About Violet.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.225
Talk to the rest of
your most wanted list.

38:14.259 --> 38:16.795
Find out how deep in the shit
we really are.

38:18.930 --> 38:22.367
None of that's possible
unless we trust each other.

38:32.777 --> 38:34.212
Single file.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.580
Prepare to be searched.

38:35.613 --> 38:37.515
Keep moving, keep moving.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.684
Through the gate.

38:39.717 --> 38:42.220
Come on, move.

38:42.253 --> 38:43.688
Nice and steady.

38:43.721 --> 38:44.589
You there!

38:44.622 --> 38:45.890
Drop the hood.

38:46.891 --> 38:50.495
I said drop the hood.

38:51.329 --> 38:52.363
[gunfire]

38:52.397 --> 38:53.765
[screaming]

38:56.434 --> 39:00.438
Drop the hood or I will
shoot you dead.

39:05.643 --> 39:07.245
Nice and slow.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.595
She's not one of them.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.898
What do you mean,
the Colonel's gone?

39:26.931 --> 39:29.634
Gone where?

39:29.667 --> 39:30.602
You, secure the gate.

39:30.635 --> 39:32.070
The rest of you,
follow me!

39:32.103 --> 39:33.972
Come on, move.
On the double.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.039
Let's go...

39:40.712 --> 39:42.914
We better be walking
to answers, gentlemen.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.750
They may not be the answers
you're looking for.

39:45.783 --> 39:46.851
That's her.

39:46.885 --> 39:47.785
Vi!

39:47.819 --> 39:48.786
Julius!

39:48.820 --> 39:50.688
We gotta get him out of here.

39:51.489 --> 39:52.690
Who's he?

39:52.724 --> 39:53.925
My father.

39:53.958 --> 39:54.859
Hansen?

39:54.893 --> 39:55.960
That's not Hansen.

39:55.994 --> 39:56.961
It is.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.529
And who the hell are you?

39:58.563 --> 39:59.664
This is Colonel Nicholson.

39:59.697 --> 40:00.999
If we wanna get out of here
we need him on our side.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.568
Someone better explain to me
what the hell is going on.

40:03.601 --> 40:04.402
They shape shift.

40:04.435 --> 40:05.670
Brides of the Dark One.

40:05.703 --> 40:07.105
Okay, we don't have time
for this.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.139
If the Oracle realizes
he's gone,

40:08.172 --> 40:09.974
that I have the pages,
we're all dead.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.509
Hang on, what's an Oracle?

40:11.542 --> 40:12.944
An evil bitch that
looks like Avery.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.612
Let's go.

40:17.682 --> 40:18.783
So you're saying Avery
isn't Avery?

40:18.816 --> 40:21.019
You're the one that said
you wanted the whole truth.

40:21.052 --> 40:23.655
How far down the rabbit hole
do you wanna go?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.066
Someone here to see you,
I think.

41:10.668 --> 41:12.737
[laughs]

41:16.607 --> 41:17.976
You found us.

41:18.009 --> 41:21.446
Like you said,
only bar in Low Town.

41:23.815 --> 41:24.782
Who's he?

41:24.816 --> 41:26.951
He's a complication.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.753
Maybe an ally.

41:28.786 --> 41:30.655
Not sure yet.

41:32.557 --> 41:33.591
I didn't get Dad.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.460
The Oracle must have him.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.028
No.

41:37.061 --> 41:38.463
Not anymore.

41:54.846 --> 41:55.980
This is our father?

41:56.014 --> 41:57.482
Mmmhmm.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.650
In his real form.

41:59.684 --> 42:03.121
He can shape shift
like the other brides.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.989
That form we knew all those
years was actually‐

42:05.023 --> 42:06.591
An illusion.

42:08.526 --> 42:10.862
What's wrong with him?

42:10.895 --> 42:12.597
I don't know.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.978
And I don't know how
to use these.

42:34.018 --> 42:38.790
Yes. Stillness.

42:41.025 --> 42:51.502
Let the pieces find their path
to the Dark One.

42:51.536 --> 42:55.139
[evil laughter]
