00:00.035 --> 00:01.609
Previously on "Midnight, Texas"...

00:01.643 --> 00:03.377
My dad does not find out.

00:03.390 --> 00:06.018
Hightower's been calling all night.

00:06.052 --> 00:07.519
I know you're in Texas.

00:07.554 --> 00:10.109
Her real name, Aubrey Hamilton Lowry.

00:10.136 --> 00:11.523
She was engaged to me.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.346
She's married. Name's Peter Lowry.

00:13.387 --> 00:15.021
A white supremacist.

00:15.056 --> 00:18.693
I didn't kill her, so tell
Lowry to stop coming after me.

00:18.732 --> 00:20.982
Shouldn't have let Bobo Winthrop out.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.944
Aubrey's husband is still out there,

00:22.982 --> 00:24.737
and as long as he is, this isn't over.

00:24.771 --> 00:27.706
Olivia... she's got more
secrets than anyone.

00:27.741 --> 00:29.141
You seem angry.

00:29.173 --> 00:31.210
Perhaps I can take
some of that from you.

00:31.244 --> 00:33.212
The veil that Midnight sits upon...

00:33.246 --> 00:34.313
It's fraying.

00:34.347 --> 00:37.049
Evil is being drawn here.

00:41.454 --> 00:42.721
What?

00:42.756 --> 00:46.125
No, I did not steal Daddy's Rolex.

00:46.159 --> 00:47.459
Quite frankly,

00:47.494 --> 00:49.428
I am offended

00:49.462 --> 00:51.664
that you would even think that.

00:51.698 --> 00:53.165
Huh?

00:53.199 --> 00:56.101
Uh, I'm... I'm losing you.

00:56.136 --> 00:57.236
You're cu...

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.560 --> 01:22.428
Mm.

01:23.630 --> 01:25.764
Hi.

01:25.799 --> 01:27.465
Now, what's a sweet,
young thing like you

01:27.467 --> 01:29.601
doing out here all alone? It ain't safe.

01:29.636 --> 01:31.870
How can some place so
beautiful be dangerous?

01:31.905 --> 01:34.440
You have no idea.

01:34.474 --> 01:36.675
So why don't you hop up
into my pride and joy here,

01:36.710 --> 01:40.446
and I'll take you
anywhere you want to go.

01:40.480 --> 01:42.786
Come on, I don't bite.

01:42.817 --> 01:44.750
I really shouldn't.

01:47.077 --> 01:48.711
Well...

01:49.839 --> 01:52.040
I won't take no for an answer.

02:07.941 --> 02:09.375
Safety first.

02:10.943 --> 02:13.679
So, uh, what brings you to Texas?

02:13.713 --> 02:17.218
I just felt this powerful
pull to come here.

02:17.257 --> 02:19.485
I've been drawn to a lot
of spiritual places...

02:19.519 --> 02:23.322
Sedona, Lily Dale, Glastonbury.

02:23.356 --> 02:25.424
- But nothing like here.
- Uh-huh.

02:25.458 --> 02:28.227
It's the energy here.

02:28.261 --> 02:31.330
It makes me feel better than
I've felt in a long time.

02:31.364 --> 02:33.599
- Desert air's good.
- It's not just that.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.167
It's this land.

02:35.201 --> 02:39.538
It's ancient, powerful.

02:39.572 --> 02:42.941
It makes me feel things.

02:42.976 --> 02:45.177
What kind of things?

02:45.211 --> 02:47.212
Why don't you pull over?

02:47.247 --> 02:49.548
I'll show you.

03:26.252 --> 03:27.953
Mm.

03:27.987 --> 03:30.756
I've been meaning to ask you about that.

03:30.790 --> 03:33.792
Oh. Not much to tell.

03:33.827 --> 03:35.394
My, uh...

03:35.428 --> 03:38.464
My grandma ran a scam
on a guy, guy got mad.

03:38.498 --> 03:40.799
Is that guy gonna try
and shoot you again?

03:40.834 --> 03:43.268
I'm working on paying off her debt.

03:43.303 --> 03:44.803
Oh, good.

03:44.838 --> 03:48.006
I'd hate for my dad
to be right about you.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.908
Right about what?

03:49.943 --> 03:52.911
That you're a no-good con man
who's gonna break my heart.

03:52.946 --> 03:54.980
Why would your father think that?

03:55.014 --> 03:58.417
I don't know. Um, the
online-psychic thing,

03:58.451 --> 03:59.924
the RV,

03:59.947 --> 04:02.687
the fact that it looks like
you're running from something.

04:02.718 --> 04:06.358
- Well, looks can be deceiving.
- Mm.

04:06.392 --> 04:09.428
Not in this case, but they can.

04:09.462 --> 04:11.864
Well, what he doesn't know is

04:11.898 --> 04:14.433
that I don't care.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.536
I'm just using you for your body.

04:17.570 --> 04:18.737
Excuse me.

04:21.341 --> 04:25.444
I just figured after saving
his entire family from vampires,

04:25.478 --> 04:27.446
the guy would have cut me some slack.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.947
Not even a little bit.

04:28.982 --> 04:31.450
So, if you want this thing
between us to continue,

04:31.484 --> 04:33.195
it means my dad cannot
know what we've been doing

04:33.197 --> 04:34.786
on my lunch breaks.

04:34.821 --> 04:36.655
Seriously.

04:36.689 --> 04:39.691
Um, but if it makes you feel better,

04:39.726 --> 04:41.460
I think this whole
sneaking-around thing's

04:41.494 --> 04:42.661
kind of hot.

04:42.695 --> 04:45.631
Well, it does feel less oppressive

04:45.665 --> 04:49.034
when you say it like that.

04:55.842 --> 04:59.878
I'm gonna text you after my shift.

05:20.533 --> 05:23.669
Hey, I brought you some...

05:23.703 --> 05:25.404
What's wrong?

05:25.438 --> 05:27.105
Investigation, my ass.

05:27.140 --> 05:30.342
They know who did it...
Lowry, Aubrey's husband.

05:30.376 --> 05:32.844
Problem is they can't find him.

05:32.879 --> 05:34.680
They will.

05:34.713 --> 05:37.646
Well, I happen to know for
a fact that Sons of Lucifer

05:37.677 --> 05:40.919
hangs out in the back
room of the Cartoon Saloon.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.390
You're thinking about
going there, aren't you?

05:45.425 --> 05:47.960
- I don't know.
- Well, you should know.

05:47.994 --> 05:49.595
Don't.

05:49.629 --> 05:51.096
Just let the cops do their job

05:51.130 --> 05:53.966
and stay away from the Cartoon Saloon.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.802
He killed Aubrey...

05:56.836 --> 05:58.036
killed the sheriff.

05:58.071 --> 06:00.806
And you just got out of jail

06:00.840 --> 06:02.074
on suspicion of murder,

06:02.108 --> 06:04.576
and we risked our lives to get you out.

06:04.611 --> 06:06.644
And you going after Lowry's
just gonna bring the cops

06:06.646 --> 06:07.713
right back to Midnight.

06:07.747 --> 06:09.881
That is not good for anybody.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.717
So you will stay out of it.

06:14.087 --> 06:17.489
You're totally right. Yep.

06:17.523 --> 06:19.391
You bet I am.

06:19.425 --> 06:21.560
I wasn't, um...

06:21.594 --> 06:23.762
thinking straight.

06:23.796 --> 06:25.964
You certainly were not.

06:25.999 --> 06:27.933
I'll stay clear of this whole mess.

06:27.967 --> 06:30.435
I...

06:30.470 --> 06:33.171
Promise.

06:33.206 --> 06:35.674
Good.

06:35.708 --> 06:39.578
Now, do you want to come
over for dinner tonight?

06:39.612 --> 06:42.514
I am making shepherd's pie.

06:42.548 --> 06:44.816
I love your shepherd's pie.

06:44.851 --> 06:46.084
I know.

06:46.119 --> 06:48.587
Hello?

06:48.621 --> 06:50.455
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

06:50.490 --> 06:52.128
I need to speak to
somebody who works here.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.425
That would be me.

06:53.459 --> 06:54.760
Did a guy come in here recently

06:54.794 --> 06:55.927
and pawn a Rolex?

06:55.962 --> 06:59.197
Did he drive a vintage red Caddy?

06:59.232 --> 07:01.099
Mm.

07:10.143 --> 07:11.762
Ass-head.

07:11.793 --> 07:13.215
It's my brother.

07:13.239 --> 07:15.447
He's missing, and our
parents are worried about him.

07:15.481 --> 07:17.182
He didn't happen to
say where he was going?

07:17.216 --> 07:19.551
He didn't say.

07:19.585 --> 07:22.521
But I do think I know
someone who can help you.

07:25.925 --> 07:27.859
I'm not sure moving
here was a smart play.

07:27.894 --> 07:29.628
I thought you liked it.

07:29.662 --> 07:34.066
I've been seeing that
cute waitress drop by.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.568
The online-psychic thing is fine,

07:36.602 --> 07:38.870
but I need to make some serious money.

07:38.905 --> 07:40.257
Hightower's not letting up.

07:40.296 --> 07:42.207
Well, how about your old clients?

07:42.241 --> 07:44.710
I bet those rich widows would love

07:44.744 --> 07:47.512
a little one-on-one with
"The Great Manfredo."

07:47.547 --> 07:49.815
I doubt Bitzi Van Der
Huff's gonna drive five hours

07:49.849 --> 07:53.819
to chat with her favorite
dead husband in a crappy RV.

07:53.853 --> 07:54.986
You know what I'm saying.

07:55.021 --> 07:56.655
My A-list clients expect

07:56.689 --> 07:59.758
a certain level of
pomp and circumstance...

07:59.792 --> 08:02.694
Nice hotels, stocked mini bar.

08:02.729 --> 08:04.727
Makes them feel they're
getting their money's worth.

08:04.729 --> 08:05.997
Don't fret, Manny.

08:06.032 --> 08:07.666
I got a feeling

08:07.700 --> 08:10.500
your luck's gonna change real soon.

08:10.523 --> 08:12.170
It better.

08:12.205 --> 08:15.006
That ain't gonna help.

08:15.041 --> 08:17.766
Actually, it does.

08:17.789 --> 08:22.280
You didn't hear
Hightower's latest message.

08:28.121 --> 08:30.722
You remember that tune?

08:30.757 --> 08:32.224
It'll be the last thing you hear

08:32.258 --> 08:34.192
before I...

08:34.227 --> 08:35.861
He wants my heart...

08:35.895 --> 08:37.529
stopped, on a platter.

08:37.563 --> 08:39.264
- Stop it.
- Hightower's old school.

08:39.298 --> 08:41.299
I'm worried this isn't just about money.

08:41.333 --> 08:42.868
He wants his pound of flesh.

08:42.902 --> 08:45.604
You settle this debt, he'll calm down.

08:45.638 --> 08:46.772
Yeah, easier said than...

08:58.584 --> 09:01.653
- You the psychic?
- Depends who's asking.

09:01.687 --> 09:04.322
The guy at the pawnshop
said you're the real deal.

09:04.357 --> 09:06.124
I need to find my brother.

09:06.159 --> 09:09.161
Not sure I believe in all this,
but I got to try something.

09:09.195 --> 09:13.665
Yeah, well, finding a
missing person's tough.

09:13.699 --> 09:16.168
Find him, I'll pay you five grand.

09:16.202 --> 09:21.106
And it's also my specialty.
Please, step into my office.

09:25.044 --> 09:27.245
How long will you be gone for?

09:27.280 --> 09:30.282
Not long. Job's in El Paso. Why?

09:30.316 --> 09:32.951
I was wondering if you'd like
to come over for dinner tonight.

09:32.985 --> 09:35.821
- Oh, girls' night?
- And Bobo.

09:35.855 --> 09:38.190
Why would you invite a third wheel?

09:38.224 --> 09:39.825
This is your chance to get some of that.

09:39.859 --> 09:41.092
Bobo's single now.

09:41.127 --> 09:42.761
Olivia, he's still grieving.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.663
Please The bitch was married...

09:44.697 --> 09:46.031
to a racist.

09:46.065 --> 09:47.599
He's not grieving.

09:47.633 --> 09:49.668
He's humiliated, and
you're just the balm

09:49.702 --> 09:51.703
to soothe his broken heart.

09:51.737 --> 09:53.897
He's my best friend. I
wouldn't even know what to do.

09:53.906 --> 09:56.683
Well, for one, no peasant skirts.

09:56.714 --> 09:58.844
But I like my skirts.

09:58.878 --> 10:00.111
Yeah.

10:00.146 --> 10:02.247
Men don't.

10:12.925 --> 10:15.627
Want to be more than besties?

10:17.430 --> 10:18.964
I could knit a sweater with those.

10:18.998 --> 10:21.633
And no sweaters.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.835
The only time Ted visits our parents

10:23.870 --> 10:25.637
is to beg for money or steal something,

10:25.671 --> 10:27.819
but now that he's missing,
they're beside themselves.

10:27.850 --> 10:31.243
You ask me, he's probably holed
up with some stripper again.

10:31.277 --> 10:32.978
I need something of your brother's,

10:33.012 --> 10:35.347
something meaningful to him...

10:35.381 --> 10:37.983
to give me a psychic impression,

10:38.017 --> 10:40.218
a clue as to where he is.

10:40.253 --> 10:43.855
Sure.

10:43.890 --> 10:45.323
Ted's pinkie ring.

10:45.358 --> 10:47.659
I took it as collateral
last time I loaned him money.

10:47.693 --> 10:50.662
Will that do?

10:50.696 --> 10:51.997
I think so.

11:01.741 --> 11:03.408
Anything?

11:14.420 --> 11:17.055
- What is it?
- Getting images.

11:17.089 --> 11:19.357
Does your brother work
with heavy equipment?

11:19.392 --> 11:20.926
Ted doesn't even have a job.

11:20.960 --> 11:24.195
- You can see me.
- Oh, yeah.

11:24.230 --> 11:26.097
Pats.

11:26.132 --> 11:28.466
Oh, Pats, you were right.

11:28.501 --> 11:32.237
I sucked as a brother, a
son. It was all my fault.

11:32.271 --> 11:35.073
Should have never picked
up that hot blonde.

11:35.107 --> 11:36.308
What hot blonde?

11:36.342 --> 11:38.710
See? I told you.

11:38.744 --> 11:40.145
Just at a rest stop.

11:40.179 --> 11:41.459
One minute, we're driving along.

11:41.480 --> 11:45.150
Next, something's eating me like a taco.

11:45.184 --> 11:48.119
And she stole my Caddy.

12:02.468 --> 12:04.336
Car won't start?

12:04.370 --> 12:06.938
Don't suppose you could give me a jump?

12:06.973 --> 12:09.240
I'll make it worth your while.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.943
Hell, yeah, I'll help.

12:11.978 --> 12:14.294
Maybe we should party first...

12:14.341 --> 12:17.015
then take care of the car.

12:21.854 --> 12:24.022
Mmm.

12:24.056 --> 12:27.792
You have been very bad.

12:29.061 --> 12:32.831
Well, I can be bad, too.

13:35.643 --> 13:37.443
Hey!

13:39.813 --> 13:41.934
Whoa. Take my wallet.

13:41.942 --> 13:43.636
I've already been paid for this.

13:43.651 --> 13:44.856
Wha... Wait!

13:44.887 --> 13:46.351
I'm here because you embezzled...

13:46.353 --> 13:49.222
401s, pensions, college funds.

13:49.256 --> 13:50.390
Who sent you?

13:50.424 --> 13:52.492
A person who's life you ruined.

13:52.526 --> 13:54.727
Look, it's just money.

13:54.762 --> 13:57.764
It's just money because you have some.

13:57.798 --> 14:00.566
To my client, it was a house,

14:00.601 --> 14:02.769
a marriage, medical treatments.

14:02.803 --> 14:05.171
You destroyed a family's life

14:05.205 --> 14:08.775
all because you thought you could cheat.

14:08.809 --> 14:11.644
Now...

14:11.679 --> 14:15.815
the world is a better place
without some people in it.

14:19.301 --> 14:22.028
And you're one of those people.

14:29.730 --> 14:32.260
Oh, my gosh.

14:32.299 --> 14:34.767
- We should call 911.
- Oh, my God. Somebody...

14:34.802 --> 14:36.836
Do... I don't know.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.838
I'm looking for a hot blonde.

14:38.872 --> 14:40.373
Yeah, who isn't, buddy?

14:40.407 --> 14:43.543
She was maybe driving
a vintage red Cadillac.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.482
Okay, then. Thanks.

15:23.784 --> 15:26.047
Hi. Why are you following me?

15:26.071 --> 15:27.686
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:27.688 --> 15:29.722
I saw you inside watching me,

15:29.757 --> 15:31.257
and now you're here...

15:31.291 --> 15:32.859
still watching me.

15:32.893 --> 15:36.729
No, I'm not. That's, uh,
some sort of a coincidence.

15:38.298 --> 15:42.101
Yeah, but I don't
believe in coincidences.

15:56.150 --> 15:57.617
Hey.

15:57.651 --> 15:59.919
Just changing my work
clothes, and I'll be over.

15:59.953 --> 16:02.722
Well, no rush. Just setting the table.

16:02.756 --> 16:04.457
Well, I'll see you soon.

16:04.491 --> 16:05.792
Bye.

17:00.134 --> 17:01.914
Hey, babe.

17:01.949 --> 17:04.450
Do you mind getting
my things in the trunk?

17:04.484 --> 17:05.917
Sure.

17:07.221 --> 17:08.820
Thanks.

17:12.992 --> 17:14.974
I see you brought your work home.

17:52.766 --> 17:54.634
Crap.

18:01.300 --> 18:04.102
You in there, Ted?

18:07.681 --> 18:10.583
♪ This little light of mine ♪

18:10.617 --> 18:13.586
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

18:13.620 --> 18:16.756

18:16.790 --> 18:19.692

18:28.702 --> 18:31.337
Oh, my.

18:31.371 --> 18:34.340
What's a girl to do around here?

18:34.374 --> 18:36.842
So many handsome men.

18:36.877 --> 18:39.278
So many naughty men.

18:39.313 --> 18:40.613
You're not my type.

18:40.647 --> 18:43.716
But you've been so bad.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.552
I can feel it.

18:46.587 --> 18:48.854
It makes me want to...

19:30.401 --> 19:32.986
- Oh, this is tragic.
- Shut up.

19:33.017 --> 19:34.737
Shutting me up don't change the fact

19:34.739 --> 19:36.283
that you been stood up, my friend.

19:36.314 --> 19:38.408
- You don't know that.
- Sure.

19:38.443 --> 19:40.344
But when you decide to face reality,

19:40.378 --> 19:43.046
how about putting a little of
that shepherd's pie in my bowl?

19:50.822 --> 19:52.422
Hey, you running late?

19:52.457 --> 19:55.940
I hate to do this, but I got to cancel.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.237
Okay, um...

19:58.280 --> 20:00.014
Right.

20:00.034 --> 20:03.698
You know, I-I got to go.
There's someone at the door.

20:09.453 --> 20:10.965
You busy?

20:10.999 --> 20:12.166
Nope, not anymore.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.001
I could use your help.

20:15.537 --> 20:17.338
More teeth.

20:22.944 --> 20:25.179
Yeah, but more... Rows of teeth,

20:25.213 --> 20:29.550
mouth open like this gaping hellhole.

20:31.086 --> 20:33.054
And a-a spider web
tattoo on the shoulder.

20:33.088 --> 20:34.422
And she was...

20:34.456 --> 20:36.023
Eating...

20:36.058 --> 20:37.425
people, yeah.

20:37.459 --> 20:39.660
Sounds like a succubus, which is odd.

20:39.694 --> 20:41.996
I haven't seen one around
here in over a century.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.532
- A succubus?
- Ancient supernaturals...

20:44.566 --> 20:47.001
Hunters, rare.

20:47.035 --> 20:48.502
They usually lie low,

20:48.537 --> 20:50.604
and they have a perpetual glamour

20:50.639 --> 20:53.941
that lets them appear beautiful
so they can seduce their prey.

20:53.975 --> 20:55.109
Prey?

20:55.143 --> 20:57.912
- As in... men.
- Mm-hmm.

20:57.946 --> 21:00.181
But they only feed on
men who've caused pain.

21:00.215 --> 21:03.551
- Wonder why she came after you?
- Yeah, why?

21:06.488 --> 21:10.124
So no... no one here has
ever caused anyone pain?

21:10.158 --> 21:12.226
Fair enough.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.095
The real question is, why now?

21:14.129 --> 21:16.263
Why would a succubus show up here

21:16.298 --> 21:18.399
acting so recklessly?

21:21.403 --> 21:23.537
Why are you here?

21:23.572 --> 21:26.540
It's dinnertime. I'm hungry.

21:26.575 --> 21:28.075
Why are you acting so weird?

21:28.110 --> 21:29.944
Is Manfred in there?

21:29.978 --> 21:33.080
Uh, I'm being weird because
you should be at home,

21:33.115 --> 21:34.215
and I'm at work.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.550
We...

21:36.585 --> 21:40.054
Look, I know you like
Manfred, and we owe him.

21:40.088 --> 21:42.289
But Dad's right. You
can't trust him, okay?

21:42.324 --> 21:43.657
He's a total sleazebag.

21:43.692 --> 21:45.459
What are you talking about?

21:47.295 --> 21:49.263
I followed him today.

21:49.297 --> 21:52.266
I saw him coming out of a strip club.

21:54.169 --> 21:57.138
He was looking for someone.

21:57.172 --> 21:59.106
I'm not worried, okay?

21:59.141 --> 22:01.475
So order something to go.

22:01.510 --> 22:03.970
This succubus is leaving
a trail of bodies.

22:04.011 --> 22:05.979
And bodies will bring
the law back to Midnight,

22:06.009 --> 22:07.314
and we can't have that.

22:07.349 --> 22:09.315
We need to stop her before
she causes more damage.

22:09.317 --> 22:13.120
- So how do we do that?
- Dragon's breath...

22:13.155 --> 22:14.655
according to medieval folklore.

22:14.689 --> 22:17.191
- And Wikipedia.
- Okay.

22:17.225 --> 22:21.328
Short of finding a dragon,
how do you stop a succubus?

22:21.363 --> 22:23.130
I think I know.

22:26.668 --> 22:29.303
Ross Wheeler.

22:30.505 --> 22:32.473
- So, Ross...
- Please.

22:32.507 --> 22:34.642
You're not a cop.

22:34.676 --> 22:36.377
Why are you following me?

22:36.411 --> 22:39.613
I really think you got the wrong guy.

22:39.648 --> 22:41.715
Someone paying you to follow me?

22:41.750 --> 22:44.318
Frickin' crazy!

22:47.656 --> 22:49.657
Who hired you?

22:49.691 --> 22:51.559
- No one!
- Want to tell me now?

22:51.593 --> 22:54.328
No one, no one. I swear.

22:54.362 --> 22:55.529
What?

22:55.564 --> 22:57.331
- What's that?
- Your father!

22:57.365 --> 23:00.501
Your... your father hir...
Your father hired me.

23:00.535 --> 23:02.069
Yeah.

23:02.103 --> 23:04.171
Thought so.

23:04.206 --> 23:06.040
I'm making a tincture.

23:06.074 --> 23:09.543
It's really just a
fancy word for potion.

23:09.578 --> 23:13.681
This will remove the succubus's glamour.

23:13.715 --> 23:15.316
Yeah.

23:15.350 --> 23:19.753
Without her looks, she
will not be seducing anyone.

23:21.389 --> 23:24.391
See, it's really just basic chemistry.

23:24.426 --> 23:27.902
So we can slow her down,
but how do we find her?

23:27.926 --> 23:29.230
She'll be looking for men.

23:29.264 --> 23:31.198
If a woman's trolling
for guys around here,

23:31.233 --> 23:34.034
there's only one place
to go on a Thursday night.

23:34.069 --> 23:36.604
Ow. My back.

23:36.638 --> 23:38.239
Can you just let me sit up?

23:38.273 --> 23:40.107
I'm not sure I'm gonna let you live,

23:40.141 --> 23:42.576
so you're back isn't of interest.

23:42.611 --> 23:44.712
So when did you start working for him?

23:44.746 --> 23:47.047
- He hired me a month ago.
- Paying you a lot, isn't he?

23:47.082 --> 23:48.092
Yeah.

23:48.131 --> 23:50.718
Do you know why my dad
is having me followed?

23:50.752 --> 23:52.586
You know, I asked before I took the job

23:52.621 --> 23:54.541
'cause I didn't want to
get into a bad situation.

23:54.556 --> 23:56.357
Oh.

23:56.391 --> 23:58.559
Well, that didn't quite
work out, now, did it?

23:58.593 --> 24:00.361
He just wants to know your okay.

24:00.395 --> 24:02.263
I know you left, won't return his calls,

24:02.297 --> 24:05.399
his letters.

24:05.433 --> 24:08.769
He just wants to know how you are.

24:08.803 --> 24:11.138
How's everything going?

24:16.988 --> 24:18.746
You make a sound,

24:18.780 --> 24:20.748
and I will drown you in the toilet.

24:20.782 --> 24:22.293
You understand?

24:25.620 --> 24:29.256
- You okay?
- Not by a long shot.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.759
- Do you mind?
- No, never.

24:43.271 --> 24:45.472
Oh.

24:46.941 --> 24:49.410
You okay?

24:51.546 --> 24:54.148
I'll be fine.

24:54.182 --> 24:56.617
I'm heading out. Come.

24:56.651 --> 24:59.199
- We could use you.
- Where to?

24:59.223 --> 25:02.456
It's ladies' night at Cartoon Saloon.

25:02.490 --> 25:05.693
- I'll explain on the way.
- Well, he's not going anywhere.

25:05.727 --> 25:08.162
I could use the break.

25:27.849 --> 25:30.818
We just need to get a drop of tincture

25:30.852 --> 25:32.286
in the succubus's mouth.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.853
Then we have to get
her away from people,

25:33.855 --> 25:36.323
somewhere private before
anyone notices what's happening.

25:36.358 --> 25:38.359
We should split up. Blend in.

25:38.393 --> 25:40.327
Sure.

25:40.362 --> 25:42.830
Blend in.

25:55.243 --> 25:57.211
Really?

25:57.245 --> 25:59.313
Who is it?

25:59.347 --> 26:00.781
Pony-Boy.

26:10.258 --> 26:12.259
I want to talk to Peter Lowry.

26:12.293 --> 26:14.695
I don't think I know the man.

26:14.729 --> 26:17.231
You enjoy the remodel?

26:20.435 --> 26:23.904
I know Lowry killed his
wife and the sheriff.

26:23.938 --> 26:26.707
But he's the police's problem now.

26:26.741 --> 26:29.743
All I want is to be left alone.

26:29.778 --> 26:32.546
You make me sick, Winthrop.

26:32.580 --> 26:35.883
You're a traitor to
your family, your race.

26:35.917 --> 26:38.218
You got so little pride,

26:38.253 --> 26:40.721
you'd rather pollute yourself
by living with those...

26:52.600 --> 26:54.535
Bobo, we should go.

27:04.204 --> 27:07.740
Any of you set foot in Midnight again,

27:07.774 --> 27:10.142
I'll kill you.

27:11.878 --> 27:14.747
I'm sorry.

27:14.781 --> 27:17.583
For what... Standing me up

27:17.617 --> 27:20.085
or almost killing a man
right in front of me?

27:20.120 --> 27:23.188
Look, I'm not saying he
didn't deserve it, but...

27:23.223 --> 27:25.824
but you coming down here by
yourself is just plain dumb.

27:25.859 --> 27:27.760
Yeah, it was.

27:27.794 --> 27:30.462
You're right.

27:30.497 --> 27:32.431
It means a lot that you came after me.

27:36.703 --> 27:39.438
You look real pretty tonight.

27:41.374 --> 27:42.775
I didn't come after you.

27:42.809 --> 27:44.643
I came here with everyone. We have to...

27:44.678 --> 27:48.614
We have to find some hot
blonde who's been killing men.

27:55.889 --> 27:57.356
I think that's her.

27:57.390 --> 27:59.825
Be careful.

28:05.932 --> 28:07.633
Hey.

28:11.171 --> 28:12.505
I should kick your ass.

28:12.535 --> 28:13.864
My... my bad.

28:13.895 --> 28:18.677
I thought she was, um, Tricia, my ex.

28:18.712 --> 28:20.713
I see her everywhere...

28:20.747 --> 28:23.248
When I wake up, when
I'm driving, everywhere.

28:23.283 --> 28:25.384
I...

28:25.418 --> 28:27.720
I just can't really believe she's...

28:27.754 --> 28:29.254
She's gone for good, you know?

28:29.289 --> 28:31.557
She just walked out, and that's it.

28:31.591 --> 28:34.693
Five years.

28:36.596 --> 28:38.831
I feel you, brother,

28:38.865 --> 28:41.567
but you need to move on.

28:54.948 --> 28:57.216
You're good.

28:57.250 --> 29:00.352
Avoiding conflict, one of my skills.

29:00.387 --> 29:02.755
Need it growing up in a gypsy caravan.

29:02.789 --> 29:05.791
Wow.

29:28.682 --> 29:31.650
Vampires...

29:31.685 --> 29:33.159
now a succubus.

29:33.189 --> 29:36.291
At least you didn't expose yourself.

29:37.824 --> 29:39.479
You exposed yourself?

29:39.518 --> 29:41.459
The vampires were about
to kill our friends.

29:41.461 --> 29:43.262
You can't keep taking risks like this.

29:43.296 --> 29:45.930
- If they find us...
- Nobody's gonna find us.

29:45.953 --> 29:47.799
Right now we're dealing with a problem.

29:47.836 --> 29:49.435
You're here with me, okay?

29:49.469 --> 29:50.436
Okay.

30:02.382 --> 30:04.583
What are you drinking?

30:04.617 --> 30:06.452
Gave it up a while back.

30:06.486 --> 30:09.321
Sometimes I indulge...
Special occasions.

30:09.355 --> 30:12.858
But once I get a taste,
it's hard to stop.

30:12.892 --> 30:14.626
Slippery slope and whatnot.

30:14.661 --> 30:18.430
Maybe you should twelve-step
it over to a meeting.

30:24.971 --> 30:28.340
Doesn't exactly work that way.

30:31.698 --> 30:32.800
Nope.

30:32.823 --> 30:36.448
Just a lot of ladies wearing
cocoa butter body spray.

30:41.054 --> 30:43.622
Maybe she's somewhere else.

30:43.656 --> 30:44.990
Like, um...

30:45.024 --> 30:48.293
The Boobie Trap?

30:48.328 --> 30:49.795
How'd you know?

30:49.829 --> 30:52.331
My brother told me. He followed you.

30:52.365 --> 30:55.634
Okay, that's... That's creepy.

30:55.668 --> 30:58.871
He was worried about me.

30:58.905 --> 31:01.540
And you should have invited me.

31:01.574 --> 31:05.711
God. You really are perfect.

31:11.551 --> 31:12.918
Succubus?

31:12.952 --> 31:15.654
No. My brother.

31:21.528 --> 31:22.828
Connor?

31:22.862 --> 31:26.431
Sorry, don't fall for it. He's only 17.

31:26.466 --> 31:28.867
Go. Come here.

31:30.637 --> 31:32.504
I can't believe you followed me.

31:32.539 --> 31:33.739
Well, I was worried.

31:33.773 --> 31:35.674
Connor, I'm an adult,

31:35.708 --> 31:38.043
I get to take risks, and
when you're an adult...

31:38.077 --> 31:40.679
You're so handsome.

31:40.713 --> 31:41.914
Connor, get in the truck.

31:41.948 --> 31:43.348
- But I...
- Go. I mean it.

31:43.383 --> 31:44.783
Right now. Get in the truck.

31:44.818 --> 31:47.519
Go home.

31:48.955 --> 31:51.076
I don't live too far from here.

31:51.121 --> 31:52.255
Nice.

31:57.701 --> 31:59.599
Hey, cowboy, you want
to get out of here?

31:59.623 --> 32:02.113
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

32:04.823 --> 32:07.305
_

32:11.057 --> 32:12.324
Come on.

32:12.358 --> 32:13.925
Go and unwind a bit.

32:13.959 --> 32:16.861
I would like that, yes.

32:16.896 --> 32:19.130
There we go.

32:19.165 --> 32:21.666
Get in there, pretty lady.

32:21.701 --> 32:22.834
Excuse me.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.202
What?

32:31.679 --> 32:33.780
You might want to think twice.

32:35.081 --> 32:37.182
Y'all are crazy!

32:41.387 --> 32:43.355
We need to get her out of sight.

32:43.389 --> 32:46.157
Got it.

33:07.113 --> 33:08.380
Is this normal?

33:08.414 --> 33:10.815
Transformations are always painful.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.731
Good job on the tincture.

33:27.032 --> 33:29.834
What have you done to me?

33:29.869 --> 33:31.269
I took away your glamour

33:31.303 --> 33:32.737
so you couldn't kill any more men.

33:32.772 --> 33:34.005
We had no choice.

33:34.039 --> 33:36.174
Supernaturals lay low in these parts.

33:36.208 --> 33:39.110
Indiscriminate hunting of
humans will not be tolerated.

33:49.121 --> 33:50.755
She dead?

33:55.461 --> 33:58.263
Oh, God.

34:02.935 --> 34:04.769
You all expected that?

34:04.804 --> 34:06.729
- No.
- That's a surprise.

34:06.768 --> 34:08.940
- What do we do now?
- Creek!

34:08.974 --> 34:10.241
- Help!
- That's Connor.

34:10.275 --> 34:13.812
- Let's go.
- Everybody split up.

34:13.846 --> 34:15.146
Connor!

34:31.163 --> 34:32.466
What, do you see him?

34:32.480 --> 34:34.505
No. No, keep looking.

34:34.527 --> 34:36.967
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

34:37.002 --> 34:39.237
My RV.

34:49.014 --> 34:52.417
- Connor!
- Connor, we're here!

34:52.451 --> 34:55.186
Connor!

34:55.221 --> 34:57.460
Wait, I'm begging you. Don't hurt him.

34:57.502 --> 34:59.718
He deserves it. They all do.

34:59.759 --> 35:00.926
Let him go.

35:00.953 --> 35:02.587
We know what you're going through.

35:02.617 --> 35:04.728
I struggle with appetites
that I need to keep in check.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.332
- Maybe I can help.
- Hey.

35:07.366 --> 35:09.367
Grab him. Stay back.

35:23.916 --> 35:26.150
Closest thing to dragon's
breath I could find.

35:26.185 --> 35:28.853
Uh, quick thinking.

35:32.091 --> 35:35.860
Literally a hot mess.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.198
Speaking of which...

35:44.436 --> 35:47.372
Hey, Ross.

35:47.406 --> 35:50.875
I'm back.

35:50.910 --> 35:52.043
Now...

35:53.946 --> 35:56.047
What am I gonna do with you?

36:08.653 --> 36:11.588
- Take care of him.
- Oh, God, please don't kill me.

36:20.998 --> 36:23.933
I'm not gonna kill the messenger...

36:23.968 --> 36:25.535
this time.

36:27.538 --> 36:30.907
She's feeling generous tonight.

36:33.911 --> 36:38.348
Let me tell you about your employer.

36:38.382 --> 36:40.116
He wasn't there when I was a kid.

36:40.151 --> 36:42.986
He left me with the woman he married,

36:43.020 --> 36:44.854
and she liked pills.

36:44.889 --> 36:48.024
But when her habit got out of control,

36:48.059 --> 36:50.060
he cut her off.

36:50.094 --> 36:52.362
But like I said, Dad was never around,

36:52.396 --> 36:54.698
so she found other ways
to make her pill money...

36:56.934 --> 36:58.668
Me.

36:58.703 --> 37:01.137
There are a lot of twisted
men out there, Ross,

37:01.163 --> 37:04.832
who will pay top dollar
for a pretty girl.

37:04.875 --> 37:07.143
Your employer didn't
worry about me then.

37:07.178 --> 37:10.513
He does not get to worry about me now.

37:10.548 --> 37:12.849
And if he sends anyone
else, they'll die.

37:12.883 --> 37:16.653
And if I see you again, Ross...

37:16.687 --> 37:18.822
you'll die.

37:18.856 --> 37:20.423
- Understand?
- Yeah.

37:20.458 --> 37:23.393
You're never gonna see me again.

37:23.427 --> 37:26.096
I'm sorry.

37:30.968 --> 37:34.471
I'll give you a minute to get changed.

37:36.574 --> 37:39.042
I fetched top dollar in my day, too.

37:39.076 --> 37:41.745
Oh, well, we have so much in common.

37:45.549 --> 37:49.085
And yet, all that pain
gives you plenty to leech.

37:53.124 --> 37:54.924
I'm sorry for what they did to you.

37:54.959 --> 37:58.061
Don't be.

37:59.797 --> 38:03.066
You saved me.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.701
And the other guys?

38:04.735 --> 38:07.771
Oh, they're all dead.

38:14.612 --> 38:16.980
Here.

38:17.014 --> 38:18.648
What are you thinking?

38:18.682 --> 38:20.483
I'm just thinking
about how that succubus

38:20.518 --> 38:21.901
scared the crap out of me.

38:21.940 --> 38:24.821
Well, it serves you
right for following me.

38:24.855 --> 38:26.489
Let's go home.

38:26.524 --> 38:29.592
Would you do me a favor?

38:29.627 --> 38:31.561
Not that you deserve it.

38:31.595 --> 38:33.930
Don't tell Dad about tonight.

38:33.964 --> 38:37.934
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

38:37.968 --> 38:40.069
Her hunger was unstoppable.

38:42.706 --> 38:45.508
It's happening.

38:45.543 --> 38:47.944
The veil's affecting supernaturals.

38:47.978 --> 38:49.779
I think so.

38:49.814 --> 38:53.149
What if we can't fight the pull?

38:53.184 --> 38:55.785
What if I can't?

39:02.793 --> 39:06.796
Look, we've got plenty
of time to be scared.

39:06.831 --> 39:10.767
Tonight we're okay. We're safe.

39:10.801 --> 39:12.001
Come here.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.942
Let's just worry about tonight.

39:20.010 --> 39:21.945
Sounds like a plan.

39:31.822 --> 39:33.656
Sorry about what happened to him.

39:33.691 --> 39:35.558
Yeah, well...

39:35.593 --> 39:38.294
we never would have found
Ted's body without your help.

39:40.197 --> 39:42.198
Thank you.

39:52.176 --> 39:54.210
Hey.

39:58.182 --> 40:00.216
- How's Connor?
- He's good.

40:00.251 --> 40:01.918
He's grateful.

40:01.952 --> 40:03.720
Wasn't a big deal.

40:03.754 --> 40:05.889
Shut up.

40:27.311 --> 40:29.078
Hey.

40:29.113 --> 40:31.214
Hey.

40:36.620 --> 40:37.921
Twice now...

40:37.955 --> 40:40.256
You made sure I got out of jail...

40:40.291 --> 40:43.726
last night with the skinheads.

40:43.761 --> 40:46.029
No matter what, you're
always there for me.

40:46.063 --> 40:48.598
Of course I am, Bobo.

40:48.632 --> 40:50.199
You're my best friend.

40:54.138 --> 40:56.306
Is that it?

40:56.340 --> 40:59.375
Is that all you want this to be?

40:59.410 --> 41:01.878
'Cause sometimes I think
my life's been better

41:01.912 --> 41:05.248
since you've been in it, and...

41:05.282 --> 41:07.917
and I wonder if I shouldn't just...
