00:47.552 --> 00:51.192
Where are you taking me?
Into the garden of earthly delights.

00:56.192 --> 01:00.832
A change? What kind of change?
I'm not sure exactly.

01:00.832 --> 01:04.891
When HG Wells was visiting,
he made a most peculiar comment.

01:04.891 --> 01:07.752
He said he could tell there was
something missing from my life

01:07.752 --> 01:09.292
and that he hoped I would find it.

01:09.292 --> 01:11.552
That was rather presumptuous of him.

01:11.552 --> 01:13.272
Yes, it was.

01:13.272 --> 01:14.892
But the odd thing is,

01:16.592 --> 01:18.092
he was right.

01:23.672 --> 01:25.952
You're so beautiful.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.352
I dream about you every night.

01:28.352 --> 01:29.832
Luther...

01:32.252 --> 01:35.052
But I thought you loved your work.
I do.

01:35.052 --> 01:38.172
And it goes without saying I
enjoy working with you.

01:38.172 --> 01:42.152
But I'm a doctor, William.
Not a detective.

01:42.152 --> 01:44.472
You'd make a very good one.

01:44.472 --> 01:47.832
I could put a word in
with the superintendent.

01:47.832 --> 01:50.912
I was the only woman attending
medical school in Montreal.

01:50.912 --> 01:53.532
It was very important to me
that I succeed. And you have.

01:53.532 --> 01:58.332
I'm the only one from my class
who's still cutting up cadavers.

01:58.332 --> 02:00.972
The Hippocratic Oath
was wasted on me.

02:07.472 --> 02:10.332
What is it? What did I do?

02:14.292 --> 02:16.632
There are a hundred good
doctors in this town.

02:16.632 --> 02:19.052
But only one that
can do what you do.

02:19.052 --> 02:22.272
William... Julia, you have a gift.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.652
I thank you for that,

02:25.272 --> 02:28.972
but this is not just about my work.
What, then?

02:32.072 --> 02:33.492
WHISTLE PEEPS

02:38.112 --> 02:39.692
It appears we are needed again.

02:47.892 --> 02:51.512
She hasn't been here long.
Fewer than 12 hours, I'd estimate.

02:53.212 --> 02:56.252
She was strangled.
So it would appear.

03:08.912 --> 03:13.772
What have you, George?
The young lad and his
lady friend found the body, sir.

03:13.772 --> 03:15.352
What were they doing out here?

03:15.352 --> 03:17.272
Just having a stroll, they said.

03:18.812 --> 03:21.152
No blood, no signs of a struggle.

03:21.152 --> 03:22.832
Perhaps the body was moved here.

03:25.912 --> 03:29.952
At least we know who she was.
"Miss Abigail Tunstall."

03:29.952 --> 03:31.792
And an address on Wellesley Street.

03:34.472 --> 03:36.632
Oh, my.

03:36.632 --> 03:39.932
According to Miss Tunstall's
landlady, she was a kitchen hand.

03:39.932 --> 03:41.832
Quite a wardrobe for a kitchen hand.

03:41.832 --> 03:47.832
I'll say. I can't imagine she was
chopping cabbage or curdling
cheese in these fineries.

03:47.832 --> 03:51.352
How did she afford all
this clothing, I wonder?

03:51.352 --> 03:54.632
Perhaps she was one of those women
who can really spot a bargain.

03:54.632 --> 03:59.152
My Aunt Primrose says any
girl can dress like a lady
if she has an eye for value.

03:59.152 --> 04:01.332
A true font of wisdom, your aunt.

04:01.332 --> 04:04.612
Not according to Aunt Iris who has a
rather low opinion of Aunt Primrose.

04:04.612 --> 04:08.532
Called her a gluttonous imbecile
once. Not to her face.

04:08.532 --> 04:12.052
George, how many aunts do you have?
Well, let's see...

04:12.052 --> 04:17.232
There's Aunt Amaryllis, Aunt
Aster, Aunt Azalea, Aunt Begonia,
Aunt Bryony. Thank you, George.

04:17.232 --> 04:19.192
Sir, that's just the As and Bs.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.712
You can fill me in on the Cs
through Z another time.

04:21.712 --> 04:23.372
I'll look forward to it.

04:23.372 --> 04:24.812
We'll have some tea.

04:26.572 --> 04:27.532
Oh, my goodness.

04:28.572 --> 04:31.352
Sir, I think you'll want
to have a look at these.

04:33.772 --> 04:36.432
Oh, my. Rather saucy.

04:36.432 --> 04:39.732
Indeed. Looks like our girl was
involved in some risky business.

04:41.332 --> 04:44.852
Yes. Perhaps that's why
Miss Tunstall has turned up dead.

04:49.692 --> 04:51.932
She died some time
between midnight and 2am.

04:51.932 --> 04:54.572
What can you tell me
about her attacker?

04:54.572 --> 04:57.432
A man,
judging by the size of the hand.

04:57.432 --> 05:00.832
A good few inches taller than her,
by the angle.

05:03.312 --> 05:05.172
Any other injuries?

05:05.172 --> 05:07.632
Any...interference?

05:07.632 --> 05:10.752
No sign of that. Small comfort.

05:10.752 --> 05:14.472
Such a beautiful girl.
Such a pity she ended up this way.

05:14.472 --> 05:17.012
But not entirely unexpected.

05:17.012 --> 05:22.012
William, just because she posed
for titillating picture postcards.

05:22.012 --> 05:26.712
It's a fact that women is this line
of work invite unhealthy attention.

05:26.712 --> 05:31.612
They "invite" it? Well...attract it.

05:31.612 --> 05:31.712
Pornography sets men's minds
to...dark urges.

05:31.712 --> 05:36.192
From what you've described,
the postcards in question
are hardly pornographic.

05:40.412 --> 05:44.272
Yes. Well. Perhaps they were
more than enough for her killer.

05:44.272 --> 05:45.812
PHONE RINGS

05:45.812 --> 05:49.132
You'll have my report
by the end of the day.

05:49.132 --> 05:51.212
Very good.

06:01.552 --> 06:04.532
Dr Julia Ogden.

06:04.532 --> 06:10.252
Dr Folwell.
Yes, I did receive your letter.

06:10.252 --> 06:12.072
Tomorrow evening would be perfect.

06:13.632 --> 06:15.112
I look forward to it.

06:21.932 --> 06:24.312
OK, let's have those back.

06:24.312 --> 06:26.472
Give me those.

06:26.472 --> 06:28.572
Very funny.

06:28.572 --> 06:31.992
Have some respect for the dead,
for Pete's sake.

06:31.992 --> 06:37.292
Oi! What's all the racket?
Whatever it is you're up to,
pack it in and get back to work.

06:37.292 --> 06:40.192
Crabtree, I expect you to set a
better example. Me, sir? Murdoch.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.792
You and Happy Dafty, my office.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.792
Happy Dafty!

06:43.792 --> 06:45.292
What did you do?

06:48.272 --> 06:49.852
Well? What's this girl's story?

06:49.852 --> 06:53.292
Miss Tunstall worked in the kitchen
at the King's Goose Tavern.

06:53.292 --> 06:55.712
She finished her shift
and left just after midnight.

06:55.712 --> 07:00.112
Some bloke followed her out?
No-one saw anything. Any boyfriends?

07:00.112 --> 07:04.032
According to her workmates at the
tavern, there was no-one special.
Let me see these.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.452
Mm.

07:08.272 --> 07:10.792
Nice.

07:10.792 --> 07:12.652
Inspector, really.

07:12.652 --> 07:14.732
I was referring to the
quality of the work.

07:14.732 --> 07:19.272
The composition is professional,
and the paper stock is top notch.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.652
The paper stock, sir.

07:20.652 --> 07:23.072
First thing I noticed.

07:23.072 --> 07:26.592
Judging by these, I'd suggest a
visit to my old friend Marcus Evans.

07:32.072 --> 07:33.712
That's perfect.

07:39.212 --> 07:42.012
I thought I told you to shut this
place down. George, the girls.

07:42.012 --> 07:44.552
Ladies. A pleasure to
see you again, Sergeant.

07:44.552 --> 07:47.152
It's Inspector. Moving
up in the world, I see.

07:47.152 --> 07:51.412
Unlike you, Evans,
still crawling around in the gutter.
Let me see this camera.

07:51.412 --> 07:55.952
Not my camera. Shift, Evans.
It's evidence. Evidence of what?
My work is purely artistic.

07:55.952 --> 07:57.792
Artistic!

07:57.792 --> 08:01.812
Tell that to the wives of the
husbands who buy your trash.

08:01.812 --> 08:04.532
And this time it's not
just about saucy postcards.

08:04.532 --> 08:06.312
Perhaps you recognise this woman.

08:06.312 --> 08:10.292
Abigail. What of her?
She is one of your models, then.

08:10.292 --> 08:14.352
Was. She quit a while ago.
I haven't seen her since.

08:14.352 --> 08:16.072
She's been found dead, Marcus.

08:16.072 --> 08:19.412
Any theories? Oh, no.

08:19.412 --> 08:23.932
Oh, poor Abby.
Mr Evans, do you know of anyone who
would want to harm Miss Tunstall?

08:23.932 --> 08:28.392
No-one. She was... Everybody liked
Abby. Except whoever did her in.

08:28.392 --> 08:32.532
I've got their names and addresses.
I'll get full statements
once they're dressed.

08:32.532 --> 08:34.472
Grab any negatives, Crabtree. Please!

08:34.472 --> 08:36.172
I can't afford to replace those.

08:36.172 --> 08:42.092
And the camera. Not the camera,
Inspector! It's my livelihood. A
young lady in your employ is dead.

08:42.092 --> 08:44.492
I think it's time
for a career change, sunshine.

08:46.832 --> 08:48.312
Miss.

08:51.472 --> 08:54.232
Is there something else, Miss...?

08:54.232 --> 08:56.232
Mahoney. Moira Mahoney.

08:56.232 --> 08:57.992
Miss Mahoney.

08:59.752 --> 09:01.552
You knew Abigail, didn't you?

09:01.552 --> 09:04.672
Yes. Me and Abby were pals.

09:04.672 --> 09:08.732
Then I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

09:08.732 --> 09:11.272
Have you any idea who may
have wanted to harm her?

09:11.272 --> 09:13.352
No, but...

09:15.552 --> 09:19.672
thing is, when she quit here,
she went on to something else.

09:19.672 --> 09:23.792
Something else?
There was an apartment.

09:23.792 --> 09:25.392
Abby took men there.

09:25.392 --> 09:28.752
She asked me if I wanted in on it.
I thought about it.

09:28.752 --> 09:31.252
Miss Mahoney, it's all right.

09:31.252 --> 09:34.252
I'm only interested in who may
have wanted to harm Abigail.

09:35.832 --> 09:39.892
I went along once, but changed
my mind before I ever went inside.

09:39.892 --> 09:41.832
It was...

09:41.832 --> 09:43.952
it wasn't right.

09:43.952 --> 09:45.772
Do you recall the address?

09:53.886 --> 09:55.606
It looks like a doxy's digs, sir.

09:55.606 --> 10:00.246
Certainly does. It would appear
Miss Tunstall was involved in
more than just cheeky pictures.

10:00.246 --> 10:02.406
What did you find, George?

10:02.406 --> 10:04.726
Just a small kitchen
and a water closet.

10:15.706 --> 10:20.066
A darkroom.
Yes. The question is, what's
it doing in a doxy's apartment?

10:20.066 --> 10:21.586
A hobby, perhaps.

10:24.966 --> 10:27.666
George,
go turn on the light in the boudoir.

10:40.386 --> 10:42.326
George,
come and have a look at this.

10:44.606 --> 10:47.366
Oh, my goodness.
A mirror you can see right through!

10:47.366 --> 10:49.466
It's a half-silvered mirror, George.

10:49.466 --> 10:52.326
They're used in scientific
experiments to split beams of light.

10:52.326 --> 10:55.666
I suspect the use in this case
is somewhat less scrupulous.

10:59.926 --> 11:04.466
Sir, imagine we had one of these at
the station, in the interview room.

11:04.466 --> 11:07.686
We could observe suspects
without them knowing we were there.

11:07.686 --> 11:13.946
In this case, I believe
the intention was to photograph
people without their knowledge.

11:13.946 --> 11:15.706
People in the bed.

11:15.706 --> 11:17.166
Yes, George.

11:20.506 --> 11:22.246
What have you there, sir?

11:22.246 --> 11:23.706
A hinge.

11:34.866 --> 11:36.866
This is a camera?

11:36.866 --> 11:39.106
It's no bigger than a cigar box.

11:39.106 --> 11:44.626
Remarkable, isn't it?
It's the latest from the Eastman
Kodak company, the "Pocket Kodak".

11:44.626 --> 11:47.526
But the plates? How do they fit?

11:47.526 --> 11:49.186
Plates are a thing of the past.

11:49.186 --> 11:56.006
George Eastman has introduced a
new flexible film made of cellulose.
It stays INSIDE the camera.

11:56.006 --> 11:58.426
What will they think of next?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.706
What are you doing?
You've been at that half an hour.

12:00.706 --> 12:03.086
I'm trying different combinations.

12:03.086 --> 12:06.386
I thought you'd cracked it.
What's the bloody stethoscope for?

12:06.386 --> 12:11.286
You can hear the bolt pass over
the first tumbler. The other
are trial and error, I'm afraid.

12:11.286 --> 12:13.326
But that's 60 numbers.
Times another 60.

12:13.326 --> 12:18.746
Each number has a leeway of
one digit either side, making a
total of 400 possible combinations,

12:18.746 --> 12:21.006
of which I've tried 76.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.706
Murdoch, just drill the bloody thing.

12:27.226 --> 12:30.306
Don't look so smug. What's inside?

12:30.306 --> 12:32.486
Money.

12:32.486 --> 12:35.106
Photographs.

12:35.106 --> 12:36.606
Oh, my.

12:38.326 --> 12:42.266
These make Evans' postcards look
like invitations to a church social.

12:42.266 --> 12:44.346
Look closer, sir.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.386
Good God. Alderman Merrick.

12:47.386 --> 12:50.886
And Clarence Chislett,
the District Court Justice.

12:50.886 --> 12:53.646
I'll be years trying to forget these.

12:53.646 --> 12:57.966
A record was kept of their
names and addresses.

12:57.966 --> 12:59.726
All important toffs.

12:59.726 --> 13:05.746
Was it blackmail then? Such men
would pay a lot of money to ensure
these photographs were never seen.

13:05.746 --> 13:09.606
It wouldn't take much for a
beauty like Miss Tunstall to
lure them to the apartment.

13:09.606 --> 13:11.706
I wonder who took these photos.

13:11.706 --> 13:14.306
This could be our answer now.
What have you, George?

13:14.306 --> 13:19.546
According to the landlord,
the apartment was leased two
months ago by a John Smith.

13:19.546 --> 13:23.146
John Smith. John Smith, George.

13:23.146 --> 13:25.346
Clearly, that's not his real name.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.226
Oh.

13:27.226 --> 13:31.666
So how do we find him?

13:31.666 --> 13:35.186
George, this camera is brand new.
Telegraph the Eastman company.

13:35.186 --> 13:38.566
Find out what stores in
Toronto carry this model.

13:38.566 --> 13:40.526
Sir, right away.

13:40.526 --> 13:43.026
A dangerous game
they were playing.

13:43.026 --> 13:46.266
One of these "clients"
could have done Miss Tunstall in.

13:46.266 --> 13:49.006
Yes. 
They would have had motive.

13:49.006 --> 13:50.626
We'll interview all of them.

13:50.626 --> 13:55.566
Tread carefully, Murdoch. These
"gentlemen" carry a lot of clout.

13:55.566 --> 13:59.266
More of the same? No.

13:59.266 --> 14:03.006
These photos were taken elsewhere.
Different vintage...

14:03.006 --> 14:04.486
older.

14:08.566 --> 14:10.806
Why yes, Mrs Pendrick.

14:10.806 --> 14:13.046
Is this a social call?

14:13.046 --> 14:16.006
How wonderful. Iced water.

14:19.046 --> 14:20.326
Sir.

14:22.646 --> 14:25.106
Sir, it's Sally Pendrick.

14:44.166 --> 14:46.086
Detective Murdoch.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.886
What fiendish crime of mine
brings you here this time?

14:49.886 --> 14:55.526
Mr Pendrick, I apologise
for my unannounced visit.

14:55.526 --> 14:57.926
What do you think of my
latest concept, Detective?

14:57.926 --> 14:59.766
Toronto of the future.

14:59.766 --> 15:05.726
Millions of people in fully
self-sufficient towers, connected by
a vast grid of underground railways

15:05.726 --> 15:10.246
and elevated paths, fed by
endless acres of rooftop farms.

15:10.246 --> 15:14.126
Whole generations never need set a
foot outside, working and playing

15:14.126 --> 15:17.926
in the sheltered security
of their tower communities.

15:19.506 --> 15:21.146
Fascinating.

15:21.146 --> 15:23.346
Actually,
I'm here to speak with your wife.

15:24.386 --> 15:30.106
I see. I trust you don't intend to
accuse her of some dastardly deed.

15:30.106 --> 15:32.806
Not at all.
I have an art question for her.

15:32.806 --> 15:34.606
Ah.

15:34.606 --> 15:37.046
One of those urgent...

15:37.046 --> 15:38.646
art questions.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.866
At any rate... Wait here.

15:42.866 --> 15:45.246
I will see if I can find her.

15:50.306 --> 15:51.766
Art question.

15:55.846 --> 15:57.686
A model of the solar system.

15:57.686 --> 15:59.686
You and James,

15:59.686 --> 16:02.486
both fascinated by such things.

16:04.286 --> 16:09.186
Mrs Pendrick.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

16:09.186 --> 16:12.526
Actually, it's imperative I speak
to you in the utmost privacy.

16:12.526 --> 16:14.306
Certainly.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.386
What could possibly
demand such intimacy?

16:18.386 --> 16:19.686
This.

16:19.686 --> 16:21.266
Oh, my God.

16:23.226 --> 16:27.266
It was found in the course of
a murder investigation. Murder?

16:27.266 --> 16:30.306
A young woman named Abigail Tunstall
was found murdered yesterday.

16:30.306 --> 16:32.526
Possibly by the man
who took these photos.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.986
I'm sorry, I must sit.

16:36.986 --> 16:38.566
Of course.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.606
I was young

16:46.606 --> 16:48.946
and without prospects.

16:48.946 --> 16:51.186
He offered me money. Good money.

16:52.766 --> 16:55.766
Who did?
His name was Colin McTavish.

16:55.766 --> 16:58.426
He kept an apartment in Albany.

16:58.426 --> 17:00.846
I was to bring men
to the apartment and...

17:03.046 --> 17:05.826
entice them to disrobe.
 That was all.

17:05.826 --> 17:08.486
I never prostituted myself.
You must believe me.

17:10.306 --> 17:13.406
Did you know he was blackmailing
the men in the photographs?

17:13.406 --> 17:14.606
I didn't want to know,

17:16.006 --> 17:18.726
but it doesn't surprise me.

17:18.726 --> 17:20.445
He's been blackmailing me.

17:20.445 --> 17:24.986
Apparently he saw my photo in
the Gazette and remembered me.

17:24.986 --> 17:26.886
He threatened to show
the photos to James.

17:28.886 --> 17:31.726
How much? So far, $1,500.

17:31.726 --> 17:37.886
So far? He keeps coming back to
the well every couple of months. I'm
due for another payment any day now.

17:37.886 --> 17:41.946
Why didn't you come to me?
I was ashamed, of course.

17:41.946 --> 17:45.506
If only one could erase all the
poor decisions of one's past.

17:45.506 --> 17:48.206
Should this Colin
McTavish contact you again...

17:48.206 --> 17:49.966
I'll let you know immediately.

17:52.186 --> 17:54.426
Detective Murdoch?

17:54.426 --> 17:57.366
I beg you not to
mention this to James.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.426
He knows nothing of my past.

17:59.426 --> 18:01.526
It would devastate him.

18:07.866 --> 18:13.886
Sir. I spoke with a retailer
who said he sold a black leather
Pocket Kodak just three weeks ago.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.866
Have we a name?

18:15.866 --> 18:20.306
The buyer was Mr McTavish.
First initial C. Said he
was a nature photographer.

18:20.306 --> 18:22.266
That's one way of putting it,
I suppose.

18:22.266 --> 18:24.166
The initial C stands for Colin.

18:24.166 --> 18:28.186
He hails from New York State. He's
blackmailing Mrs Pendrick, as well.

18:28.186 --> 18:30.766
Quite the gold mine, there, sir.
Indeed.

18:30.766 --> 18:34.846
And, if the past is any indication,
he'll be back for more.
Then we'll have him.

18:34.846 --> 18:37.486
Colin McTavish.
Do you think he's our killer, sir?

18:37.486 --> 18:41.646
He could be. But so could any
of the men in those photographs.
Have we identified them all?

18:41.646 --> 18:46.206
All except for this fellow, sir.

18:46.206 --> 18:49.046
And his name wasn't
on the list you found.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.726
Keep looking, George. Sir.

18:54.126 --> 18:55.846
SHE HUMS

19:03.566 --> 19:07.266
You seem cheerful. Do I?

19:07.266 --> 19:09.046
I must have forgotten myself.

19:10.626 --> 19:13.726
I came to see if you would like to
have a walk with me this evening.

19:13.726 --> 19:17.166
We never got a chance to finish
our conversation yesterday.

19:17.166 --> 19:22.746
Yes, I would love to, truly,
but I have an engagement.

19:22.746 --> 19:25.346
Ah. A meeting?

19:25.346 --> 19:26.986
A dinner, actually.

19:26.986 --> 19:29.766
With a colleague.

19:29.766 --> 19:31.246
A business dinner.

19:34.126 --> 19:37.086
Perhaps another time, then. Yes.

19:37.086 --> 19:38.326
Yes, another time.

19:52.946 --> 19:55.226
Sir. What have you learned, George?

19:55.226 --> 19:58.586
All the men confirmed receiving
copies of the photos in the mail.

19:58.586 --> 20:01.966
With threats to make them public if
monies weren't paid. You're correct.

20:01.966 --> 20:06.046
$50 in most cases,
mailed to a post office box in town.

20:06.046 --> 20:09.286
$50 is substantial,
but hardly worth killing over.

20:09.286 --> 20:10.426
I shouldn't think so.

20:10.426 --> 20:15.126
Alibis? They all gave a complete
account of their actions the day
Miss Tunstall was murdered,

20:15.126 --> 20:19.526
including Judge Chislett,
who in fact admitted to
accosting Mr Evans at one point,

20:19.526 --> 20:23.266
thinking Evans was behind
the blackmail note.
You found them to be truthful?

20:23.266 --> 20:26.626
I think so. Embarrassed, mostly.

20:26.626 --> 20:31.106
At any rate, I have Higgins
confirming the alibis.
Discreetly, I hope.

20:31.106 --> 20:36.646
Though one of these men could be our
killer, the rest are simply victims
of blackmail. Of course, sir.

20:36.646 --> 20:41.266
Excuse me, sir. A Colin McTavish
was released from New York
State penitentiary last June.

20:41.266 --> 20:43.646
They're sending
his Bertillon measurements.

20:43.646 --> 20:46.126
Thank you, Constable Worsley.

20:46.126 --> 20:49.786
Well, that would explain
Mr McTavish's sudden re-emergence.

20:56.626 --> 21:00.686
"Dear Sally,
I very much enjoyed our last meeting

21:00.686 --> 21:06.726
"and thought it was time we meet up
again unless you'd prefer that your
husband learn your true nature."

21:06.726 --> 21:11.046
As frightening as
this is, Mrs Pendrick,
it's precisely what I'd hoped for.

21:11.046 --> 21:14.306
I want him apprehended
as badly as you do.

21:14.306 --> 21:17.166
Will I be required to testify?

21:17.166 --> 21:19.386
We have him on a number
of other blackmail charges

21:19.386 --> 21:22.206
and he's our number one suspect
in the murder of Miss Tunstall.

21:22.206 --> 21:24.926
I see no reason for you to
have to take the stand.

21:27.246 --> 21:33.146
He's expecting you at eight,
I suggest we leave at
quarter to the hour.

21:33.146 --> 21:37.606
So, I meet him,
give him the money and leave.

21:37.606 --> 21:40.366
We'll have other men posted nearby.

21:40.366 --> 21:43.406
The moment you're clear,
they'll move in. And I'll be safe?

21:43.406 --> 21:46.266
McTavish has no reason
to harm you, Sally.

21:46.266 --> 21:48.826
It's clear he intends to
continue demanding money.

21:48.826 --> 21:51.346
I'll put an end to that tonight.

22:07.086 --> 22:09.166
Dr Julia Ogden, I presume.
 Why, yes.

22:09.166 --> 22:10.946
I am Dr Martin Folwell.

22:10.946 --> 22:12.906
I'm delighted to meet you in person.

22:17.346 --> 22:18.426
Thank you.

22:18.426 --> 22:21.346
Now, what shall you have?
A glass of champagne, perhaps?

22:21.346 --> 22:24.006
Champagne?

22:24.006 --> 22:28.226
I'm endeavouring to woo you, Doctor
Ogden. You must allow me my methods.

22:39.266 --> 22:42.166
We'll be late. He'll wait.

22:42.166 --> 22:45.666
Of all the outcomes
I ever imagined for myself.

22:45.666 --> 22:51.286
Here I am with my future dependent on
the retrieval of a sordid photograph.

22:51.286 --> 22:54.786
There's a certain dark humour in it.
Yes, I suppose.

22:54.786 --> 22:58.046
I do wish that you hadn't learned
of my indiscretions, Detective.

22:58.046 --> 23:00.826
That's long in the past. Yes.

23:00.826 --> 23:03.546
But your respect means
a great deal to me.

23:03.546 --> 23:07.586
I just hope...
My respect for you is undiminished.

23:10.506 --> 23:12.426
To your lovely city.

23:12.426 --> 23:15.486
I do believe it is almost
as attractive as Buffalo.

23:17.106 --> 23:19.786
Yes, I've heard it said.

23:19.786 --> 23:24.726
I'm most interested to hear more
about your new hospital, of course.
The Children's Hospital of Buffalo.

23:24.726 --> 23:27.786
A nurturing environment
dedicated to our most vulnerable.

23:27.786 --> 23:29.846
We have high hopes.

23:29.846 --> 23:34.646
I imagine it would be quite effective
to have a staff dedicated solely
to the treatment of children.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.546
That's it, precisely.
And, as I mentioned in my letter,

23:37.546 --> 23:43.966
such a progressive hospital would
do well to have a female physician
as our head of paediatric surgery.

23:43.966 --> 23:47.086
Is that something
you would consider?

23:52.306 --> 23:54.046
I used to sing.

23:54.046 --> 23:58.586
Growing up in Montreal, my dream
was to become a famous soloist.

23:58.586 --> 24:00.786
I was quite good, actually.

24:00.786 --> 24:06.226
Unfortunately my parents thought
singing to be a sordid career choice,
so I ran away to New York.

24:06.226 --> 24:10.146
Took some voice lessons,
I did a bit of performing.

24:10.146 --> 24:12.986
You didn't pursue it?
I ran out of money.

24:12.986 --> 24:17.906
Living in New York City, I could
barely feed myself. Do you know
what that's like, Detective?

24:17.906 --> 24:19.666
I can only imagine.

24:19.666 --> 24:22.106
I was hungry, alone and terrified.

24:22.106 --> 24:24.906
Easy prey for someone
like Colin McTavish.

24:26.026 --> 24:27.326
He...

24:27.326 --> 24:33.746
He convinced me I could support
my singing career if I moved to
Albany to work for him.

24:35.326 --> 24:37.666
I believed him.

24:37.666 --> 24:40.866
How I regret that now.

24:43.326 --> 24:46.626
That's close enough, driver! Whoa!

24:48.206 --> 24:49.846
The warehouse is just ahead.

24:49.846 --> 24:53.946
Return immediately upon
completing the transaction.

24:53.946 --> 24:56.706
I have men posted
all around the warehouse.

24:56.706 --> 24:59.146
They won't make a move
until you're safely out.

25:26.306 --> 25:27.746
EXPLOSION

25:31.346 --> 25:33.346
Sally!

25:43.746 --> 25:45.346
Sally, can you hear me?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.186
Sally.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.306
What happened?

25:52.306 --> 25:54.026
There was an explosion.

25:54.026 --> 25:56.946
Are you all right?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.146
I think.

25:58.146 --> 25:59.906
It's just a small cut.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.966
Oh, God. If we'd arrived
just a moment earlier. Indeed.

26:11.086 --> 26:13.266
McTavish.

26:13.266 --> 26:16.866
George, have the men take a look.
There might still be someone inside.

26:16.866 --> 26:18.626
Sir.

26:18.626 --> 26:21.006
Sally!

26:21.006 --> 26:24.146
Sally, you're hurt. I'm fine.

26:29.226 --> 26:32.106
What are you up to? Are you trying
to get my wife killed?

26:32.106 --> 26:35.246
The more pertinent
question, Mr Pendrick,
is what are you doing here?

26:35.246 --> 26:37.326
Did you follow Sally?

26:37.326 --> 26:39.566
That's Mrs Pendrick to you, sir.

26:39.566 --> 26:41.946
Her well-being is my concern.

26:41.946 --> 26:44.706
Why exactly did you
bring her here?

26:44.706 --> 26:46.366
That's police business.

26:46.366 --> 26:49.686
Your "police business"
risked my wife's life.

26:49.686 --> 26:52.066
I'll be making that point
to your superiors.

26:58.166 --> 27:02.946
Sir, there's a man inside
the building. Dead or alive?

27:02.946 --> 27:04.506
Very much dead, sir.

27:06.926 --> 27:11.706
It's Colin McTavish. The Bertillon
measurements leave no doubt.

27:11.706 --> 27:16.446
Most of the blast wounds are on his
right side. This embedded debris.

27:16.446 --> 27:19.306
Yes. Flying shards of wood
and metal and glass.

27:19.306 --> 27:23.906
Beyond that...
The state of the body is making
the post-mortem rather difficult.

27:23.906 --> 27:25.826
That's unfortunate.

27:25.826 --> 27:28.346
Any word on the cause
of the explosion?

27:28.346 --> 27:31.586
The Fire Chief seems to think
it was a gas leak.

27:31.586 --> 27:35.086
You don't sound convinced.
It's the timing.

27:35.086 --> 27:38.666
Just at the moment when
Sally Pendrick was supposed
to enter the building.

27:38.666 --> 27:40.766
Yes.

27:40.766 --> 27:44.286
How is she?
She had quite a close call.

27:44.286 --> 27:46.606
She's shaken, but she'll be fine.

27:46.606 --> 27:48.666
You must be relieved.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.146
Yes, quite.

27:53.706 --> 27:58.626
Julia, are you concerned
about the nature of my
relationship with Mrs Pendrick?

27:58.626 --> 28:01.506
Is that the cause for this...

28:01.506 --> 28:03.426
distance between us?

28:03.426 --> 28:05.786
No. I promise you.

28:05.786 --> 28:08.046
It has nothing to do
with Sally Pendrick.

28:18.866 --> 28:23.106
If the explosion was
the result of a gas leak,
as the Fire Chief suspects,

28:23.106 --> 28:25.546
something ignited a roomful of gas.

28:25.546 --> 28:27.446
McTavish, lighting a cigar.

28:27.446 --> 28:34.446
Or a lamp. Either of those. The
resulting explosion would have sent
debris outward in all directions.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.906
Like this.

28:37.586 --> 28:42.306
However, McTavish's injuries
were concentrated to
the right side of his body,

28:42.306 --> 28:47.586
as if the explosion came from
one side of the room.

28:47.586 --> 28:49.666
What would have caused that?

28:49.666 --> 28:51.426
I don't know.

28:51.426 --> 28:53.906
I'd like to return to the
warehouse and take another look.

28:53.906 --> 28:57.726
If McTavish WAS murdered,
it was likely by the same
person who killed Abigail.

28:57.726 --> 29:00.126
I'll wager it was one of
their blackmail victims.

29:00.126 --> 29:03.966
Except, sir, all those men
have alibis for the night
of Miss Tunstall's murder.

29:03.966 --> 29:07.606
We must have missed something.
Have we interviewed them all?

29:07.606 --> 29:10.486
Everybody except for this
chap we couldn't identify.

29:10.486 --> 29:14.206
Right, George.
Enlarge that photograph.

29:14.206 --> 29:18.546
And make copies. Perhaps someone at
another station can identify him.
Sir, will do.

30:49.066 --> 30:52.206
What's all this?
The remnants of a bomb, sir.

30:52.206 --> 30:55.466
This pile of leavings?
It was found at the blast site.

30:55.466 --> 31:01.706
So no gas leak. There was a ruptured
gas line, but that was a result of
the explosion, not the cause of it.

31:01.706 --> 31:06.686
What do you plan on doing with all
this? If I can determine
how the bomb was made,

31:06.686 --> 31:10.966
it may lead us to the person
who set it. The answer lies
in reconstructing the bomb.

31:10.966 --> 31:14.426
You can do that? I can try.

31:14.426 --> 31:16.186
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:16.186 --> 31:17.586
Dr Ogden is asking for you, sir.

31:20.586 --> 31:23.546
It's quite curious,
but there's no doubt about it.

31:23.546 --> 31:29.026
Colin McTavish was dead before the
explosion occurred. There is no trace
of searing or ash inside the lungs.

31:29.026 --> 31:33.046
How long has he been dead?
Not long. Perhaps a day or two.

31:33.046 --> 31:36.266
Why would anyone go to the trouble
of blowing up a dead body?

31:36.266 --> 31:38.446
Why indeed?

31:38.446 --> 31:41.806
And the actual cause of death?
I'm still trying to determine that.

31:43.706 --> 31:46.346
Thank you, Doctor. I must be off.

31:53.326 --> 31:56.266
Sir. I've enlarged the photograph.
Did you make copies?

31:56.266 --> 31:59.466
Not yet. I thought you should
have a look first. Ah.

32:00.606 --> 32:04.406
I still don't recognise him.
Not him, sir. Her.
Look in the mirror.

32:04.406 --> 32:06.746
That's not Abigail.

32:06.746 --> 32:08.266
No. It's Moira Mahoney.

32:08.266 --> 32:11.306
The one who stayed to speak
with us at Marcus Evans' studio.

32:14.146 --> 32:15.986
Miss.

32:17.426 --> 32:22.106
So it is. She swore she was never
in the apartment but there she is.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.726
In the flesh, so to speak.

32:23.726 --> 32:25.886
Well done, Crabtree.

32:25.886 --> 32:27.786
Bring her in. Immediately. Will do.

32:30.126 --> 32:31.466
DOORBELL RINGS

32:33.026 --> 32:35.226
Detective. Mrs Pendrick.

32:35.226 --> 32:36.906
Is your husband here?

32:36.906 --> 32:39.426
Why, no, he's at the office.
Good, good.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.846
Sally, you have to leave here.

32:41.846 --> 32:44.666
You're in danger. What in the
world are you talking about?

32:44.666 --> 32:48.606
That explosion wasn't a gas leak.
It was a bomb and I believe
it was meant for you.

32:48.606 --> 32:50.506
Me?

32:50.506 --> 32:54.386
How do you know? McTavish was already
dead when the bomb went off.

32:54.386 --> 32:58.626
Someone else lured you to the
building, knowing you'd arrive
just in time for it to explode.

32:58.626 --> 33:02.306
My goodness. But why leave here?

33:02.306 --> 33:07.526
I can think of only one person
who might want both you
and McTavish dead...

33:07.526 --> 33:08.746
your husband.

33:14.072 --> 33:18.012
Mr Pendrick must
have found out about your
involvement with McTavish.

33:18.012 --> 33:23.312
He must have overheard us talking.
He was in another part of the house.
Perhaps he has hidden microphones.

33:23.312 --> 33:26.872
I hardly think! How did he know
you'd be at that warehouse?

33:26.872 --> 33:30.412
He followed us. He said as much
on the carriage ride home.

33:32.052 --> 33:35.312
He was concerned about
your attentions towards me.

33:35.312 --> 33:37.752
I believe he lured
you to that warehouse.

33:37.752 --> 33:39.712
The note came from Colin.

33:39.712 --> 33:45.712
Perhaps Mr Pendrick forged it.
Or he killed McTavish after he
wrote it. No. That can't be.

33:45.712 --> 33:48.972
I've always believed someone else
was behind the Rembrandt theft.

33:48.972 --> 33:51.932
Four people died in that incident,
one of them shot by your husband.

33:51.932 --> 33:55.192
James shot Luca Carducci
to save your life.

33:55.192 --> 33:56.792
Or to silence him.

33:56.792 --> 34:00.172
And what about the Eugenics Society?
What about it?

34:00.172 --> 34:02.872
James wasn't responsible
for Linus Malling's death.

34:02.872 --> 34:06.292
Still, his views on the matter
are entirely sinister.

34:06.292 --> 34:08.411
I believe your husband
is a dangerous man.

34:08.411 --> 34:10.391
I simply don't believe you.

34:10.391 --> 34:12.112
James would never hurt me.

34:12.112 --> 34:17.472
Mr Pendrick has the technical
capability of building an explosive
device. So do many people.

34:17.472 --> 34:20.831
What proof do you have? Hm?

34:20.831 --> 34:23.812
Sally, please...

34:23.812 --> 34:26.232
for your own safety.

34:26.232 --> 34:29.632
I'm afraid I'm going to have to
ask you to leave, Detective.

34:29.632 --> 34:31.351
And it's Mrs Pendrick.

34:31.351 --> 34:35.712
But... I'm quite serious. Get out.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.632
My office, George.

34:48.632 --> 34:52.012
Sir, the Inspector is with Moira
Mahoney in the interview room.

34:52.012 --> 34:54.492
She's the one in the photo
with the mystery man.

34:54.492 --> 34:57.752
Really? Hm.

34:57.752 --> 35:00.572
George. These are the remnants
of an exploded bomb.

35:00.572 --> 35:02.812
It's my intention to
put it back together.

35:02.812 --> 35:04.312
GEORGE LAUGHS

35:04.312 --> 35:06.412
You're serious. Yes.

35:06.412 --> 35:10.352
But first I need you to clean the
carbon residue off of every piece.

35:17.152 --> 35:19.352
I don't know who that girl is.

35:19.352 --> 35:23.152
Look in the mirror. 
Look closer.

35:28.432 --> 35:31.772
It was just the one time, I swear.

35:31.772 --> 35:36.552
I'm not that kind of girl. Really.
You didn't have any problem
stripping down for Marcus Evans.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.332
That was different.

35:38.332 --> 35:41.052
I never had to go starkers
and no-one ever touched me.

35:41.052 --> 35:44.092
I'm not a doxy! I don't care
if you're the whore of Babylon!

35:44.092 --> 35:48.632
I want to know everything you
know about this operation,
starting with him. Who is he?

35:48.632 --> 35:50.692
I don't remember his name. Rubbish!

35:50.692 --> 35:53.152
Abby knew him. I didn't.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.252
I've never seen him before or since.

35:55.252 --> 35:57.752
How did you choose your marks?
I didn't.

35:57.752 --> 36:00.332
I told you. I wanted no part of it.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.712
How did Abigail Tunstall
know which men to approach?

36:03.712 --> 36:05.592
She had Mr Evans' client list.

36:05.592 --> 36:09.632
She stole it? She didn't have
to steal it. He gave it to her.

36:09.632 --> 36:14.412
Is that so? Abby told him she
wanted to know which men liked
to buy the postcards of her.

36:14.412 --> 36:19.192
So then Abigail contacted those men
and invited them up to the apartment.

36:19.192 --> 36:22.172
How many of these so-called
gentlemen were on the list?

36:22.172 --> 36:26.172
A lot. Abby was very popular.

36:26.172 --> 36:27.832
I wasn't nearly so.

36:27.832 --> 36:29.972
Evans just handed over the list,
did he?

36:29.972 --> 36:32.812
Well, he didn't know what
she wanted it for, did he?

36:32.812 --> 36:35.832
If he had known,
he never would have agreed.

36:35.832 --> 36:38.052
Why? Because of his
abiding moral conscience?

36:38.052 --> 36:39.892
No.

36:39.892 --> 36:42.012
Because it would
have broken his heart.

36:42.012 --> 36:44.692
He was crazy in love with her.

36:46.752 --> 36:49.432
They were lovers? No.

36:49.432 --> 36:51.512
She'd never let him.

36:53.152 --> 36:56.772
If he'd known what she was doing
it would have killed him.

36:58.652 --> 37:03.052
I'm not convinced, sir.
I still think Pendrick
planted the bomb in that warehouse.

37:03.052 --> 37:05.912
You're always on about bloody
Pendrick. Sir, he had motive

37:05.912 --> 37:08.652
and he was in the vicinity of
the warehouse when it exploded.

37:08.652 --> 37:11.952
You're barking up the wrong tree,
Murdoch. Evans is our boy.

37:11.952 --> 37:15.092
He was in love with Abigail Tunstall,
who ditches him for McTavish,

37:15.092 --> 37:18.192
and just as a final kick in the old
plums, she takes his client list.

37:18.192 --> 37:21.272
Evans has motive to kill
the both of them.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.192
All right, let's go.

37:23.192 --> 37:24.772
Hats and coats.

37:26.532 --> 37:28.112
You never learn, do you?

37:29.872 --> 37:34.592
Just wait there. It's time to
come clean, Evans. I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:34.592 --> 37:37.432
Abigail Tunstall and Colin McTavish.

37:37.432 --> 37:39.632
You killed them. I did not.

37:39.632 --> 37:45.052
Your best girl. Your little angel.
Want to see more? No.

37:45.052 --> 37:46.472
There are dozens of them.

37:46.472 --> 37:49.852
All of Abigail Tunstall
and your ex-clients.

37:49.852 --> 37:53.752
It must have driven you insane,
knowing Abigail ditched you
for that sort of business.

37:53.752 --> 37:55.892
You've got it all wrong.

37:55.892 --> 37:57.772
I didn't know why
Abby left the studio.

37:57.772 --> 38:00.952
The love of your life, and you didn't
bother to find out why?

38:00.952 --> 38:03.312
She had them lined up
around the block, Evans.

38:03.312 --> 38:06.932
Making money hand over fist, her and
McTavish, blackmailing your clients.

38:06.932 --> 38:09.752
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:09.752 --> 38:14.172
That's funny, because Judge Chislett
told us he confronted you.

38:14.172 --> 38:16.012
You knew, didn't you?

38:24.192 --> 38:25.812
What was it like...

38:25.812 --> 38:30.412
knowing what the love of your
life was doing with all these men?

38:30.412 --> 38:34.572
Any man, in fact, but you.
Stop it! Stop it!

38:34.572 --> 38:38.532
What were you doing between
midnight and 2am on October 3rd?
I don't remember.

38:38.532 --> 38:41.292
It was three days ago!
I'll tell you what you were doing.

38:41.292 --> 38:43.932
You had your fat fingers
around her pretty little neck.

38:43.932 --> 38:46.492
You killed her, Evans.
And you killed McTavish!

38:46.492 --> 38:48.032
I didn't kill McTavish!

38:48.032 --> 38:50.192
I never even set eyes on him!

38:52.832 --> 38:55.832
I wish I had done him in, though.

38:55.832 --> 38:57.292
Instead of Abigail?

39:09.112 --> 39:11.952
I didn't mean to.

39:11.952 --> 39:14.692
I just wanted to show her
how much she'd hurt me.

39:14.692 --> 39:16.352
She was so heartless.

39:16.352 --> 39:19.672
I lost my temper.

39:19.672 --> 39:22.952
I remember grabbing her,

39:22.952 --> 39:25.912
shaking her.

39:25.912 --> 39:28.372
The next thing I knew, she was dead.

39:32.372 --> 39:36.592
What about Sally Pendrick?
How does she figure into this?

39:36.592 --> 39:38.732
Sally who?

39:39.992 --> 39:43.692
Evans had a reason to kill Abigail
and McTavish, but not Sally.

39:43.692 --> 39:48.912
While Pendrick may have wanted both
McTavish and Sally dead, but
not Abigail Tunstall.

39:48.912 --> 39:51.672
Thank you. So we're dealing
with two separate crimes.

39:51.672 --> 39:53.572
One of which involves
James Pendrick.

39:53.572 --> 39:55.652
You know you're treading
on dangerous ground.

39:55.652 --> 40:00.092
Pendrick has already spoken to
the Chief Constable about you. If
you're wrong... I'm not wrong.

40:00.092 --> 40:02.572
Not this time.
 So what's the plan?

40:02.572 --> 40:05.592
At the moment I have a bomb
to put back together.

40:05.592 --> 40:07.552
Interesting.

40:09.872 --> 40:13.732
So the explosive material was
contained in this metal pipe.

40:13.732 --> 40:14.832
That's right.

40:14.832 --> 40:19.652
And this is the remains of a
timing device which would have
been attached to a blasting cap.

40:19.652 --> 40:23.052
Which would ignite the explosives
once the timer reached eight
o'clock.

40:23.052 --> 40:26.032
That's right. But some of
the pieces appear to be missing.

40:26.032 --> 40:28.112
Unless they have been
blown beyond recognition.

40:29.692 --> 40:32.772
Sir, I think this piece
is for your lot.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.672
It's a cogwheel of some sort.

40:40.212 --> 40:44.172
George, what country of origin would
you say begins with the letters S-W?

40:44.172 --> 40:47.352
There are several I can
think of, sir. Swansea...

40:47.352 --> 40:49.332
that's in England, I believe.

40:49.332 --> 40:52.572
Sweden.
Swaziland, I think is a real place.

40:52.572 --> 40:55.752
Switzerland, George. Switzerland.

40:55.752 --> 40:57.472
What are the Swiss famous for?

40:57.472 --> 40:59.772
Chocolate. Cheese.

40:59.772 --> 41:05.132
Cheese with holes in.
Clocks, George, the Swiss are
famous for fine Swiss clocks.

41:05.132 --> 41:10.092
Fine Swiss clocks
require fine clock wheels.

41:10.092 --> 41:12.852
George, I need you to run
another errand for me.

41:16.912 --> 41:19.832
Detective, please!

41:19.832 --> 41:23.472
James Pendrick, you are under arrest
for the murder of Colin McTavish

41:23.472 --> 41:26.772
and for the attempted murder
of your wife, Sally Pendrick.

41:27.832 --> 41:30.392
Really, Detective,

41:30.392 --> 41:32.312
you've outdone yourself.

41:32.312 --> 41:34.092
This is no laughing matter.

41:35.812 --> 41:41.732
This is a clock wheel from the
timing mechanism of the bomb that
almost killed your wife. Yes.

41:41.732 --> 41:46.812
And? It is identical to the clock
wheels used in this remarkable model

41:47.012 --> 41:49.092
that I was so impressed
with months ago.

41:49.092 --> 41:51.372
So it matches. That means nothing.

41:51.372 --> 41:55.292
These clock wheels are very rare
and not readily available here.

41:55.292 --> 41:58.912
I had my constable check with
the manufacturer in Switzerland.

41:58.912 --> 42:05.172
They confirmed a shipment of several
of the clock wheels was sent to a
Pendrick Steel Company in Toronto.

42:05.172 --> 42:09.192
A record of the transactions
is in the mail as we speak.

42:09.192 --> 42:11.232
You're dead wrong, Detective.

42:11.232 --> 42:13.812
I've heard that before, sir.

42:16.672 --> 42:18.532
You'll regret this, Murdoch.

42:18.532 --> 42:21.692
Darling, don't be concerned.

42:23.232 --> 42:24.892
I'll be home before dinner.

42:40.272 --> 42:42.932
MUSIC: Violin Concerto
by Tchaikovsky

42:50.232 --> 42:51.832
Dr Folwell.

42:51.832 --> 42:53.472
What a pleasure to see you again.

42:53.472 --> 42:55.652
So this is your headquarters.

42:55.652 --> 42:58.392
A rather dreary one, I'm afraid.

42:58.392 --> 43:00.512
Tchaikovsky, is it not?

43:00.512 --> 43:02.752
Yes. From his Opus 35.

43:02.752 --> 43:06.212
Do I have good news to take
back to my colleagues at
the Children's Hospital?

43:06.212 --> 43:13.332
Oh, I... really, so soon?
I've not even had the chance
to discuss this with...my family.

43:13.332 --> 43:16.892
There's no immediate rush.
But I take it you're not saying no?

43:16.892 --> 43:19.952
I must admit I have been
contemplating a change.

43:19.952 --> 43:24.032
Yes. A grim business,
always dealing in death.

43:24.032 --> 43:26.072
It can be, yes.

43:26.072 --> 43:30.032
And the chance to heal children.

43:30.032 --> 43:32.472
I look forward to your
decision then, Doctor.

43:32.472 --> 43:33.932
Good day.

43:41.092 --> 43:45.152
I'm afraid I was rather
high-handed earlier.

43:45.152 --> 43:50.392
I apologise.
In spite of the circumstances,
this must be very difficult for you.

43:50.392 --> 43:52.252
It is difficult.

43:52.252 --> 43:54.732
But, truly, it is I
who should apologise.

43:54.732 --> 43:58.312
I turned a blind eye
to my husband's faults.

43:58.312 --> 44:00.152
He is a very clever man.

44:00.152 --> 44:04.412
Yes, and you were right
about him all along, it seems.

44:06.012 --> 44:08.792
I owe you my life.

44:08.792 --> 44:11.552
I must confess to a concern.

44:11.552 --> 44:13.172
How will you fare on your own?

44:15.872 --> 44:18.172
I've always come out all right.

44:18.172 --> 44:19.792
One way or another.

44:22.392 --> 44:27.192
Mrs Pendrick... Sally.

44:27.192 --> 44:30.172
Sally.

44:30.172 --> 44:35.572
If you are ever in need of
assistance, I would be honoured
if you were to call on me.
