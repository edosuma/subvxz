00:17.300 --> 00:18.600
I yield, sensei.

00:19.300 --> 00:22.200
You are unfocused, again.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.300
- I yield.
- Too slow.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.200
Again!

00:44.200 --> 00:46.500
Your center is filled
with conflict, John.

00:47.100 --> 00:50.400
Until you find your calm center,
you will never beat me.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.300
You can't beat
a winning smile, John.

00:54.335 --> 00:55.800
Not in retail sales.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.900
You need to show your customers
those pearly whites.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.200
Well, soon-to-be pearly whites.
You need to bleach them.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.100
Just show them you
got a pulse, Casey.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.800
Give 'em a "Hey, how ya doin?"

01:05.099 --> 01:07.000
Or a "Put 'em there, partner. "

01:07.100 --> 01:08.200
Or "You bet!"

01:09.300 --> 01:11.000
Walk on back to the back...

01:18.200 --> 01:19.300
You bet.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.800
Thanks for the
tips, Emmett.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.800
Yup. John Casey
scares me.

01:26.900 --> 01:27.765
Well, that's what happens

01:27.800 --> 01:29.665
when you bottle up
your feelings like that.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.200
You wake up one day and
you're a seething mass of pain.

01:32.235 --> 01:34.700
Right. Hey, what's going
on with you and Jill?

01:34.900 --> 01:36.600
Ah, yeah.
My, my pain.

01:36.635 --> 01:38.300
Let's talk about that.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.300
- Where is she?
- Big house.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.165
Bought a big house.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.300
Bought a real big house
up the river.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.800
Oh, that sounds
really pretty.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.565
You guys are, uh,
"done" done, right?

01:49.600 --> 01:51.765
Yeah, I mean, I just figured
out hanging out with Jill

01:51.800 --> 01:54.900
- was more about closing a door than opening one.
- I get it. I get it.

01:54.935 --> 01:57.300
Listen, the old flame can burn,
right? But I bet you, it made

01:57.335 --> 01:59.400
you even more sure who
the right girl is for you.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.100
Ah, speak of the smoking
hot angel.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.300
- I'll get out of here.
- Yeah.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.365
Hey, Sarah.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.300
Chuck, does
the Global Launch Agency

02:10.335 --> 02:11.600
mean anything to you?

02:11.800 --> 02:13.250
GLA? Sure, they've
sent probes

02:13.285 --> 02:14.700
to every planet
except Pluto.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.400
Although, Pluto's not officially
a planet anymore,

02:17.500 --> 02:19.100
which really bums me out.

02:19.300 --> 02:20.300
That's true.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.850
Space camp is where

02:21.885 --> 02:22.900
all the cool kids go.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.265
GLA also conducts

02:24.300 --> 02:26.265
top secret research
for the NSA.

02:26.300 --> 02:30.000
Most of our surveillance
and weapons tracking technology is developed there.

02:30.035 --> 02:32.100
We picked up intel that
someone might try to penetrate

02:32.135 --> 02:34.000
one of the lab's
secure facilities.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.800
I want you and the Intersect
to surveil the facility.

02:36.900 --> 02:39.000
See if there's anyone inside
who you flash on.

02:39.035 --> 02:40.100
Another mission already?

02:40.300 --> 02:42.300
Is there a problem,
Mr. Bartowski?

02:42.335 --> 02:43.300
No, no.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.565
No, I was just, you know,

02:44.600 --> 02:45.800
I was kind of hoping
for some downtime.

02:45.835 --> 02:47.900
We'll take it from here, ma'am.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.100
Aw, you need a little break,
Bartowski?

02:52.500 --> 02:54.100
Yeah, that'd be nice.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.765
I mean, finding out
Jill was Fulcrum

02:55.800 --> 02:58.000
was a bit of a shock
to the system, you know?

02:58.900 --> 02:59.700
I guess I wouldn't mind

03:00.600 --> 03:02.500
some time
to sort out my feelings.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.665
Sure thing, Chuck.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.700
I'll just call all the criminals and rogue spies

03:05.735 --> 03:07.865
and let
them know to hold on a sec,

03:07.900 --> 03:11.100
'cause Chuck Bartowski
needs some time to sort out his lady feelings.

03:11.135 --> 03:12.400
Ease up, Casey.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.965
Look, Chuck, we know how hard
this has been for you,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.500
but maybe a new mission is
exactly what you need right now.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.700
Great, new mission
in the surveillance van.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.200
Very exciting.

03:29.300 --> 03:30.665
You're on an open mic, Chuck.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.800
Am I? That's, that's
good to know.

03:32.900 --> 03:33.765
Thanks for telling me that.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.300
Uh, I have all the entrances
and exits covered.

03:36.700 --> 03:38.000
It looks pretty quiet.

03:38.100 --> 03:39.950
You're not seeing anything?

03:39.985 --> 03:41.800
Nothing. No flashes, nothing.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.000
I'm all clear here.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.100
All clear.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.500
Security's tight.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.600
Close the west lab door, Chuck!

04:08.900 --> 04:10.700
I'm in! I'm in! I'm in, it's
just going to take a second.

04:10.735 --> 04:12.300
Do it! Do it!

04:12.400 --> 04:13.800
Almost got it. Almost got it.
Almost there.

04:13.835 --> 04:15.000
Now, Chuck. Close it.

04:15.035 --> 04:16.100
Lock it down!

04:16.200 --> 04:16.665
You know, I don't know

04:16.700 --> 04:18.665
one person
who responds positively

04:18.700 --> 04:21.300
- to being yelled at!
- He's getting away, Chuck.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.900
Door closed.
Got it. There. See?

04:27.400 --> 04:28.465
You idiot!

04:28.500 --> 04:30.200
You said you knew
how to work this system.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.800
Ooh, hang in there.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.465
Come on, Chuck!

04:36.500 --> 04:37.900
Almost got it.
Almost got it.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.300
Got it.

04:40.700 --> 04:41.600
No problem.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.100
Ye of little faith.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.300
Sensei?

05:13.500 --> 05:14.400
GO!

05:23.200 --> 05:24.200
NSA TACTICAL INSTRUCTOR
TY BENNETT

05:32.200 --> 05:33.100
Oh, no.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.100
Hey, did you get
a good look at him?

05:37.300 --> 05:39.000
Didn't have to.
I know him.

05:39.035 --> 05:39.865
What?

05:39.900 --> 05:41.600
Guys! Hey! I just
flashed on that dude.

05:41.635 --> 05:42.765
And it is crazy,
it's actually

05:42.800 --> 05:44.600
kind of a small world,
funny story.

05:44.635 --> 05:45.600
Save it.

05:45.900 --> 05:47.100
His name's Ty Bennett.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.400
He was my sensei.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.400
Taught me everything I know.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.300
You okay?

05:54.700 --> 05:56.000
Hmm.
BUY MORE

05:56.800 --> 05:57.765
Feeling better now.

Chuck! Chuck! You've got to
help me! This is an emergency!

06:41.335 --> 06:42.965
- Chuck!
- What? What? What?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.365
- Ellie! Ellie! Ellie! Are you okay!?
- No! No!

06:45.400 --> 06:48.800
Devon's parents decided to take the red-eye in
from Connecticut to surprise us!

06:48.835 --> 06:50.367
You scared the heck out of me.

06:50.402 --> 06:51.865
I thought this
was life or death.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.800
It is! These are
two perfect parents that raised

06:53.835 --> 06:55.665
three perfect boys
in a perfect house,

06:55.700 --> 06:57.565
- and this place is a pigsty.
- Don't worry.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.800
We have time to clean up.
If they flew all night,

06:59.835 --> 07:01.365
they're going to want
to sleep all morning.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.000
Are you kidding me? The
awesome apple doesn't fall

07:03.035 --> 07:04.400
far from the awesome tree.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.500
I'm just going to...
I'll be right there.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.865
Awesome!
There's the man!

07:11.900 --> 07:15.100
Wow! Welcome! Hi.
You guys are very muscular.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.665
And... and awake!

07:16.700 --> 07:18.500
Chuck, this is
Devon's mom and dad.

07:18.900 --> 07:19.965
Drs. Woodcomb,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.065
so nice to finally meet you.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.100
Oh, no handshakes
in this family.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.000
- You just call me Honey.
- Okay, Honey.

07:27.035 --> 07:28.800
- I'm Woody.
- Hey, Woody.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.565
Yeah. My father
always said,

07:30.600 --> 07:32.700
"A terrible nickname
builds character. "

07:32.900 --> 07:35.000
Of course, Devon wasn't into nicknames.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.000
I just can't
wait to start planning your dream wedding.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.900
Wow! It looks
like you already have.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.200
Oh, and, Chuck,

07:44.400 --> 07:45.365
the caterer is
bringing over

07:45.400 --> 07:50.400
a sample menu tonight for Devon and Ellie
to decide what they like. We hope you

07:50.435 --> 07:53.500
and your... girlfriend
can join us.

07:53.535 --> 07:54.865
Yes! Of course!
Of course!

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900
- Sarah loves food.
- That she does!

07:56.935 --> 07:57.900
So, yeah,
we'll be there!

07:57.935 --> 07:58.865
Good. Good.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.665
So nice of you guys

07:59.700 --> 08:01.700
to help us plan
the wedding. Right, Ell?

08:01.735 --> 08:02.665
Oh, absolutely!

08:02.700 --> 08:05.800
Your mom's already been busy with
all these lists of guests, locations,

08:05.835 --> 08:07.065
color palettes...

08:07.100 --> 08:08.565
She's been
so excited

08:08.600 --> 08:10.500
ever since Devon
asked you to marry him.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.300
I can't tell you
how happy we are

08:12.335 --> 08:13.600
to welcome you
into our family.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.900
And now, you're stuck
with us, too, Chuck.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.900
You're very strong,
and have fists.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.100
Thank you, Dr. Woodcomb.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.167
"Woody. "

08:23.202 --> 08:24.165
Okay.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.265
Dad, let's go do our abs.

08:25.300 --> 08:27.200
- Ooh, yeah.
- You guys do abs.

08:27.300 --> 08:30.000
I'm... I'm just going to go...
kill myself.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.500
Ty Bennett: karate master,

08:32.700 --> 08:35.400
kung fu expert,
master strategist.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.600
A former instructor at our
training facility. And, today,

08:38.700 --> 08:40.600
one of our most wanted
rogue agents.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.965
Dude, your sensei is a badass!

08:43.000 --> 08:44.900
He's not my sensei.
He's a traitor.

08:44.935 --> 08:46.465
Wow. I've heard of Bennett,

08:46.500 --> 08:49.200
but I've never met anyone
who actually trained with him.

08:49.235 --> 08:50.665
I can't talk about it.
It's classified.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.665
We're opening Bennett's file
for this assignment.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.600
Any personal knowledge you have
could be vital to the success of this mission.

08:56.700 --> 09:00.200
Come on, Casey.
Share with us.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.500
In hell.

09:02.300 --> 09:05.000
General, if I may, why wasn't
I told that Bennett went rogue?

09:05.035 --> 09:07.600
Ty Bennett has been recruiting
his former students.

09:07.635 --> 09:08.917
He's actually turning agents?

09:08.952 --> 09:10.165
With the team he's assembled,

09:10.200 --> 09:13.300
Bennett has been extremely
effective at stealing weapons

09:13.335 --> 09:15.200
and reselling them
on the global black market.

09:15.235 --> 09:16.800
What did he steal from GLA?

09:16.900 --> 09:19.100
An advanced
inertial guidance system.

09:19.300 --> 09:20.365
Well, that's not a weapon.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.200
Well, fit sure looks like one when
it's put in a missile, moron.

09:23.235 --> 09:24.400
You know,
when you call me moron,

09:24.435 --> 09:26.265
that hurts me on the inside.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.265
Bennett got away because
you couldn't open a door.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.400
You're lucky your feelings aren't the only
thing that got hurt.

09:30.435 --> 09:33.700
Technically,
I only have to sit in the van and flash.

09:34.100 --> 09:34.800
Hey.

09:35.500 --> 09:36.600
Guys.

09:37.300 --> 09:41.300
Gentlemen, we have intel pinpointing the location
where Bennett plans

09:41.335 --> 09:43.817
to transfer the GLA technology
to his buyer.

09:43.852 --> 09:46.300
It's a construction site
in Simi Valley.

09:46.500 --> 09:49.300
I want you to stop the deal
and recover the guidance system.

09:49.335 --> 09:50.200
We're on it.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.300
You know, I wonder if it's safe
for Chuck to go on this mission.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.200
Too many unforeseeable
variables.

09:55.500 --> 09:58.200
In situations like this, he
has proven himself a liability.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.100
I think you're right, Casey.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.100
Chuck, you will
be sitting this one out.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.765
What? Wait a minute.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.500
You might... you might need me
to flash on something.

10:05.535 --> 10:06.165
Oh, this country
has gotten

10:06.200 --> 10:08.000
by for 200 years
without an Intersect.

10:08.035 --> 10:09.400
I'm sure we'll
be just fine.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.400
What? Did I hurt your feelings?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.200
<i>I've tried to spare
your feelings,</i>

10:15.500 --> 10:16.800
but the gloves
are coming off, people.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.000
I've decided to reinstitute a
time-honored Buy More tradition.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.100
Commando Wednesdays.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
That tradition
never stopped.

10:25.035 --> 10:26.200
From this day on,

10:26.600 --> 10:28.100
this branch will hold-

10:28.500 --> 10:29.500
wait for it-

10:30.400 --> 10:32.100
an Employee of the Month
contest.

10:32.135 --> 10:35.300
Oh! Isn't that exciting?

10:35.400 --> 10:36.900
I can barely contain myself,
sir.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.600
I assume you're all aware of our

10:38.635 --> 10:40.600
customer
comment cards.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.700
Each month, we will
tally your score and select a winner.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.800
He or she

10:49.300 --> 10:50.200
or whomever

10:50.300 --> 10:53.065
will not only get
an 8 X 10 glossy photo

10:53.100 --> 10:57.200
right beside Moses Finkelstein,
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH YOUR NAME HERE

10:57.235 --> 11:00.100
the CEO and founder of Buy More,

11:01.600 --> 11:03.100
but there will be

11:03.600 --> 11:05.200
a bonus prize!

11:07.000 --> 11:10.100
May the best employee win.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.965
Okay, so how are feeling
about this

11:19.000 --> 11:20.400
about this whole
Employee-of-the-Month thing?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.800
Um, you know what?
Whatever, Morgan.

11:24.835 --> 11:26.100
I don't, I don't really care.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.400
We don't care. Roger that.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.700
Hey.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.600
I thought you guys
would already be gone.

11:32.635 --> 11:34.217
Admit it.
You need me, don't ya?

11:34.252 --> 11:35.800
I came to make sure
you're okay.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.900
Well, isn't that what all the surveillance
cameras are for?

11:38.935 --> 11:40.565
Listen, I don't agree
with Casey

11:40.600 --> 11:42.500
that you would be a liability
on this mission.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.567
He was out of line.

11:43.602 --> 11:44.565
Don't worry. I get it.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.100
He thinks I let my feelings
for Jill

11:46.135 --> 11:47.065
get in the way
of the mission.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.100
But he's wrong.
I would never do that...

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
...again.

11:51.900 --> 11:52.465
Listen, Chuck,

11:52.500 --> 11:54.400
this isn't about you,
it's Casey.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.400
Casey trained with Bennett
for a long time,

11:56.435 --> 11:58.167
and when you have a mentor
like that,

11:58.202 --> 11:59.900
a real trust develops
between you,

12:00.900 --> 12:02.600
and Casey feels betrayed.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.565
I know it's hard,

12:05.600 --> 12:08.400
but maybe you could
cut him some slack.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.700
Yeah, I guess I know
how that feels.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.500
THROUGH THESE HALLS WALK THE SMARTEST
EMPLOYEES IN THE WORLD SALES TEAM

12:21.800 --> 12:23.600
All right, just to be absolutely
clear, our position on

12:23.635 --> 12:25.700
Employee of the Month
is that we don't care,

12:25.800 --> 12:26.600
Are you guys with me?

12:26.635 --> 12:28.017
Yep, not caring.

12:28.052 --> 12:29.365
Not a rat's ass.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.300
Not a fat
and/or hairy one.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.100
Wait. Why don't we care again?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.300
Because Employee of
the Month is a scam.

12:36.335 --> 12:38.700
And working hard
is for suckers.

12:39.700 --> 12:40.065
Think about it.

12:40.100 --> 12:41.565
You work hard,
sales go up.

12:41.600 --> 12:42.865
Sales go up,
shareholders get rich.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.800
Shareholders get rich,
and we get what exactly?

12:45.835 --> 12:47.065
He said something about a prize.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.100
Your face on a wall
next to Moses Finkelstein?

12:49.135 --> 12:50.165
No, thank you, no.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
You know what?
Keep your stupid stooge prize.

12:52.235 --> 12:53.800
So we get nothing?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.600
Emmett's gonna get
all the credit.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.100
He may even get a promotion.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
And then guess what?

12:59.100 --> 13:01.500
One day, he's gonna be the boss.

13:01.600 --> 13:02.265
So then what?

13:02.300 --> 13:03.765
Then Emmett turns the Buy More

13:03.800 --> 13:05.200
into a nightmare of pain
and suffering?

13:05.400 --> 13:06.450
There is a solution.

13:06.485 --> 13:07.500
Tell it,
tell it.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.400
We have our own contest,

13:09.500 --> 13:10.400
a side bet.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.200
<i>We see who can get
the lowest score</i>

13:12.235 --> 13:13.700
on their comment cards.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.800
We beat Emmett at his own game.

13:16.835 --> 13:18.900
Pure genius.

13:19.100 --> 13:19.900
From now on,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.200
the customers can go
service themselves.

13:22.700 --> 13:23.800
In the retail sense,
Jeffrey.

13:23.835 --> 13:25.200
Don't get any ideas.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.600
Bennett will never show.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.265
Why?

13:49.300 --> 13:50.400
He's too smart
for this.

13:50.600 --> 13:51.900
You get a read on the plates?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.900
Look, Casey, just call Chuck.
Maybe he'll flash on it

13:54.935 --> 13:56.417
and we'll know
who we're dealing with.

13:56.452 --> 13:57.900
I think I'll take my
chances without him.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.600
Oh, all right.

14:01.635 --> 14:02.600
Fine.

14:08.900 --> 14:09.365
Hello?

14:09.400 --> 14:11.365
Hey, we just sent you an image
of a van.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.000
Take a look at the plates,
see if you flash on it.

14:13.035 --> 14:14.165
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.800
Absolutely.
Whatever I can do to help.

14:17.000 --> 14:17.865
You know, I don't have it yet.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.465
It's probably
a high-resolution photo.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.700
And my 3G connection gets
interference in here sometimes.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.900
Spare me the Nerd Herd crap.
Get on it.

14:23.935 --> 14:25.565
If there's intel,
we need it now!

14:25.600 --> 14:27.600
Hey, I thought you said
the U.S. government got by

14:27.635 --> 14:29.600
just fine for 200 years
without the Intersect?

14:29.635 --> 14:32.000
Listen, you insignificant
little puke...

14:37.100 --> 14:37.665
You're on a mission.

14:37.700 --> 14:39.600
Maybe surrounded
by Bennett's men.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.300
Pick up, pick up, pick up,
pick up.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.300
Did you hang up on me?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.400
No, that's crazy talk.
I would never do that.

14:50.435 --> 14:52.300
It's a bad connection
that I had with the...

14:52.400 --> 14:54.200
Hold on. Let me just look
at the picture real quick.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.550
I got nothing. Sorry, no flash.

14:57.585 --> 14:59.200
Thanks for wasting my time.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.400
Hello?

15:05.900 --> 15:07.200
Hey, that's the buyer.

15:07.235 --> 15:08.465
We're out of time.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.600
Looks like we do this
the old-fashioned way.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.500
- Okay? Go.
- Yeah.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.365
Get out of the car!
Out of the car!

15:17.400 --> 15:19.100
Take the car, man,
and I won't call the cops.

15:19.135 --> 15:20.700
Hands on the car!
Put 'em on the car!

15:22.100 --> 15:22.765
Who the hell are you?

15:22.800 --> 15:23.665
I'm a driver. I'm here to pick

15:23.700 --> 15:25.300
up a passenger
and give them that.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.500
Bennett. Run! Go! Go!

15:44.500 --> 15:48.000
Excuse me.
Can you tell me where

15:48.035 --> 15:50.600
I can find John Casey?

15:52.800 --> 15:54.800
I have something
that belongs to him.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.065
...Casey,

16:01.100 --> 16:02.200
you say? John Casey?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.600
You know, I'm gonna go
to the back

16:03.700 --> 16:05.600
and-and-and check
on that for you.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.500
So let me just... do that...
quick.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.400
Pick up the phone, John.
Pick up the phone, Casey!

16:16.435 --> 16:17.500
This is Casey.

16:18.600 --> 16:22.200
Code Red! Code Red!
Redder than red!

16:22.300 --> 16:24.700
It is the reddest!
It is the reddest of all hues!

16:24.735 --> 16:26.365
We are Defcon One, or Five

16:26.400 --> 16:28.100
or whichever means "Hurry,"
right now!

16:28.135 --> 16:29.500
Bennett is at the Buy More!

16:30.300 --> 16:31.100
Oh, no.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.365
I'm looking for John Casey.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.100
Can you tell me where
to find him?

16:41.700 --> 16:43.700
What do I look like,
an information desk?

16:43.900 --> 16:45.265
Excuse me?

16:45.300 --> 16:47.500
Yes, fine, you're excused.

16:47.600 --> 16:50.400
Oh, and don't forget to fill out a customer comment card
on your way out.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.765
Wise man always

16:59.800 --> 17:02.300
treats a stranger with respect,

17:03.400 --> 17:07.000
for he could be gazing
on the face of an enemy.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.765
Hi. Sorry, sorry.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.900
I just checked into
it, sir,

17:11.000 --> 17:13.265
and John Casey
is unfortunately not

17:13.300 --> 17:16.099
working today, and I don't know
when he's gonna be back in,

17:16.135 --> 17:17.800
but you could try back
next week.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.500
Uh, maybe, maybe Tuesday-ish.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.700
Thank you.

17:22.900 --> 17:23.900
You're welcome.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.565
That guy was awesome!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.000
Dude, did you see
what he did to this can?

17:34.035 --> 17:35.400
He did this
with his bare hands.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.300
Crush, like that.
Could you imagine what he could do to a guy's face?

17:50.100 --> 17:51.600
Not feeling very
chatty right now.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.200
Hold on, Casey, don't hang up.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.600
I'm looking right at
your sensei.

17:56.635 --> 17:57.700
Bennett's at the Buy More?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.700
What? How is that possible?

17:59.735 --> 18:01.565
<i>Was. Was at the Buy More.</i>

18:01.600 --> 18:04.600
Now he's in the Large Mart
parking garage. I'm tailing him.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.500
No, stop, imbecile!
You're no match for him.

18:06.535 --> 18:07.265
Don't be an idiot!

18:07.300 --> 18:08.665
Look, you're only reacting
like this

18:08.700 --> 18:10.300
because your own feelings were
hurt, okay?

18:10.500 --> 18:11.900
Please don't lash out at me.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.000
Where did he go?

18:14.200 --> 18:15.100
Oh, God!

18:15.800 --> 18:16.500
Chuck?

18:17.100 --> 18:17.900
Chuck?!

18:18.700 --> 18:20.100
Bennett's got him.
He's probably dead by now.

18:20.135 --> 18:21.565
Shut up and drive!

18:21.600 --> 18:23.500
I'm a little tall for something
like this.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.400
Is there another seating option,
perhaps?

18:27.100 --> 18:29.200
Ell, are you sure
you're okay registering

18:29.235 --> 18:30.900
for a wedding here
at the Buy More?

18:31.100 --> 18:32.400
Whatever your parents want.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.865
You think you may not need
a vacuum sealer,

18:35.900 --> 18:38.300
but suddenly the Chief of
Surgery is coming over

18:38.335 --> 18:40.265
with her husband
for salmon kabobs,

18:40.300 --> 18:45.300
and voila, Saturday's party
turns into Sunday's picnic.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.100
Why not? Can't hurt?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.200
Ooh, camcorder.

18:50.200 --> 18:53.400
Ah, first for the honeymoon,
then the grandkids.

18:53.700 --> 18:54.600
Dad!

18:55.200 --> 18:56.600
Crossing the line.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.265
Before you say
anything,

18:58.300 --> 19:01.100
I know they're coming on strong,
but they're just really excited.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.465
They know your parents
aren't around.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.900
That's fine. I know that they're
just trying to help.

19:04.935 --> 19:07.500
And you know, they're,
they're awesome.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.500
Hey, Lester,
you seen Chuck?

19:17.600 --> 19:18.400
Maybe.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.200
So, is he around?

19:21.700 --> 19:23.000
Don't know. Could be.

19:24.300 --> 19:25.600
Can you find him for me?

19:26.100 --> 19:27.465
Yeah, sure, I could,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.100
but, uh, wouldn't that be more
fulfilling for you

19:30.135 --> 19:31.300
if you did it yourself?

19:35.000 --> 19:37.300
Look, I'm so sorry.
It's a stupid store contest.

19:37.335 --> 19:38.700
I can help you,
but do me a solid

19:38.900 --> 19:40.600
and do not mention it
on this card.

19:40.635 --> 19:42.200
Yes? Thank you, buddy.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.665
LOCKED

19:51.700 --> 19:52.465
The signal from
the watch

19:52.500 --> 19:54.200
is getting stronger.
Chuck's close.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.300
Casey, what are you doing?

20:08.335 --> 20:09.500
The vic can take the hit.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.400
Oh, no, not good, not good.

20:14.500 --> 20:15.600
Wait. I've got Chuck.

20:15.635 --> 20:16.700
It says the signal is...

20:18.500 --> 20:20.300
the signal is right
in front of us.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.900
No, Casey, stop, stop!
Chuck's in the car!

20:24.935 --> 20:25.965
You're gonna kill Chuck!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.600
Oh, fast. And he's driving very,
very fast.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
Casey!

20:45.400 --> 20:47.700
It's actually more spacious
in here than you might think.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.100
Hey!

21:03.600 --> 21:04.400
Freeze!

21:06.300 --> 21:08.900
John, it's good to see you.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.100
Keep your hands on your head.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.100
You survived my trap.
Very good.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.765
Get on your knees.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.200
I followed your career, John.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.600
You survived torture
at the hands of Baath separatists.

21:18.635 --> 21:20.967
You did two years undercover
in Afghanistan.

21:21.002 --> 21:23.300
Could you have done
any of that without me?

21:24.300 --> 21:25.100
No.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.900
Of course not.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.700
My training saved you.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.100
I came here
to ask you something.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.600
Be my student again.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.000
Take your training
to the next level.

21:39.400 --> 21:40.400
That's it?

21:40.500 --> 21:41.065
That's all you got?

21:41.100 --> 21:42.600
That's how
you're turning the others?

21:43.100 --> 21:45.800
Save your breath.
I'm no traitor.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.700
Obviously,
I made a mistake.

21:48.900 --> 21:50.900
You aren't good enough
for my team.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.200
Hey!

22:01.100 --> 22:02.400
<i>So Bennett got away.</i>

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
Again.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.565
If you don't mind me asking,

22:04.600 --> 22:06.750
where was the Intersect
during all of this?

22:06.785 --> 22:08.642
Well, technically
I was in Bennett's trunk,

22:08.677 --> 22:10.500
so I didn't see anything
that happened,

22:10.535 --> 22:11.900
but it sounded
very exciting.

22:11.935 --> 22:13.665
Wait. So, Major,

22:13.700 --> 22:15.800
while you were playing
your game of chicken,

22:15.900 --> 22:17.300
Chuck was in Bennett's trunk?

22:17.335 --> 22:18.665
As soon as we
ascertained

22:18.700 --> 22:22.100
the Intersect's location,
Major Casey disengaged.

22:22.135 --> 22:23.265
Sounds like Bennett has decided

22:23.300 --> 22:25.265
to make this personal, Casey,
and so have you.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.400
- I'm pulling you off the case.
- With all due respect...

22:27.435 --> 22:29.117
This is why I didn't tell you
about Bennett.

22:29.152 --> 22:30.765
I knew you would turn it
into a vendetta.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.400
I'm bringing in another team to clean up your mess.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.265
But I know Bennett.
I know how he operates.

22:35.300 --> 22:38.600
You're forgetting
your primary objective is protecting the Intersect.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.400
You will remain in Castle until the mission is completed.

22:41.700 --> 22:43.600
Consider it
a cooling-off period.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.700
You little...

22:47.100 --> 22:48.065
I didn't know this was
going to happen.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.900
I didn't know... tell him I didn't
know this was going to happen!

22:49.935 --> 22:55.100
If my primary objective
wasn't to protect you... I KILL YOU.

23:01.600 --> 23:02.600
I can't believe it.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.400
Beckman was out of line pulling
me off this mission.

23:05.435 --> 23:06.465
I agree with her.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.100
You're too emotionally involved.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.300
This from the agent that can't keep her
chocolate out of Bartowski's peanut butter.

23:12.335 --> 23:14.417
Whatever my feelings
may be for Chuck,

23:14.452 --> 23:16.500
I never knowingly endangered the asset.

23:16.535 --> 23:17.665
You let your anger

23:17.700 --> 23:19.600
toward Bennett cloud
your judgment.

23:20.300 --> 23:22.800
You finally admit that you do
have feelings for the nerd.

23:22.835 --> 23:25.765
No, all I will admit to
is having feelings.

23:25.800 --> 23:28.300
20 years in the business
has taught me one sure thing-

23:29.100 --> 23:32.200
that people...
people let you down in the end.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.900
Well, it's nice to know
where we stand.

23:43.500 --> 23:44.700
Did you talk to Casey?

23:45.100 --> 23:45.900
Is he mad?

23:46.500 --> 23:46.965
I feel horrible.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.800
Casey is always mad.
That's his baseline.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
I never should have said
all that stuff in front of the general.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.250
No, your assessment
was accurate.

23:54.285 --> 23:56.000
I mean, the facts
are the facts.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.450
True, but the guy's
going through a lot.

23:57.485 --> 23:59.192
If I were really a friend,
I would look past

23:59.227 --> 24:00.900
what he's saying and remember
how he's feeling.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.300
I mean, I should know
better than anybody

24:02.335 --> 24:03.700
what he's going through
right now.

24:03.735 --> 24:05.400
Chuck, you're so sweet.

24:08.400 --> 24:10.950
But, you know, an apology
is not going to work,

24:10.985 --> 24:13.542
because Casey is combat ready
at all times.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.100
Which means his feelings
are liabilities.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.800
Well, aren't you supposed
to be combat ready at all times?

24:23.300 --> 24:27.400
I'll meet you at your
sister's wedding tasting after your Buy More shift.

24:27.435 --> 24:29.800
And please,
don't go downstairs.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.000
Leave Casey alone.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.900
If it isn't
Tweedledee, Tweedledum

24:37.935 --> 24:40.100
and... Tweedledumber.

24:40.700 --> 24:42.300
Oh, congratulations
goes out to you.

24:42.400 --> 24:44.000
What do we win,
a prize or something?

24:47.200 --> 24:52.700
Well, of all the incompetent
employees in this backwater branch,

24:53.100 --> 24:54.665
you three have
distinguished yourselves-

24:54.700 --> 24:58.300
with the lowest
customer evaluation scores in recorded history.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.100
Really?

25:00.300 --> 25:03.000
- What... how low exactly?
- Are we talking like

25:03.035 --> 25:04.465
truly abysmal, or...?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.300
Combined your highest score
was a one.

25:06.335 --> 25:08.100
- Dare to dream, baby.
- All right.

25:09.700 --> 25:10.665
Well, since none of you
seem to be taking

25:10.700 --> 25:13.000
this Employee of the Month
contest very seriously,

25:13.100 --> 25:16.400
I must abandon the carrot,
and use my stick.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.500
You sure that's legal?

25:19.600 --> 25:21.900
From now on, the employee
with the lowest scores

25:22.200 --> 25:24.400
will close up
every Saturday night

25:24.600 --> 25:26.900
- for an entire month.
- All right, stop.

25:26.935 --> 25:28.400
You can't do this
to us, okay?

25:28.800 --> 25:29.565
I'm sorry, I can't?

25:29.600 --> 25:31.700
- Saturday's are sacred.
- I can't work on Shabbat.

25:31.735 --> 25:34.000
Yeah. It's date night.

25:35.900 --> 25:36.900
Laundry night?

25:39.200 --> 25:41.600
- It's two-for-one night.
- You're wasting time.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.900
You have one night
to raise your scores.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.400
You better get crackin'.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.865
This is my employee
discount card.

25:49.900 --> 25:52.100
It's good for 20% off
anything in the store. Go nuts.

25:52.135 --> 25:53.800
Just put in a good word
for me on your way out.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.100
No, mind?

25:57.400 --> 25:58.900
Why would I mind?

25:59.300 --> 26:01.550
Just let me get this puppy
loaded up for you

26:01.585 --> 26:03.800
and then I'll come right back
for sub...

26:08.300 --> 26:09.500
Four stars?!

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
I just kissed your ass
for four lousy stars?!

26:13.000 --> 26:14.700
What do you people
want from me!

26:14.900 --> 26:16.900
Just spit in my
face next time!

26:18.600 --> 26:19.500
Hey, Jeff.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.400
How's it going, man?
You all right?

26:21.600 --> 26:24.200
I think I'm getting the hang
of this customer service stuff.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.200
ENTER

26:34.500 --> 26:35.800
Yeah...

26:35.900 --> 26:36.900
ACCESS DENIED

27:01.300 --> 27:03.700
Casey, hey.
Hey, how you doing?

27:04.000 --> 27:04.800
Get down here.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.065
Um, look, I'm glad you called,
because I was actually going

27:08.100 --> 27:11.600
- to call you to say sorry... - I don't care
if it's your time of the month, Bartowski.

27:11.635 --> 27:12.700
Get down here please.

27:13.200 --> 27:14.100
I don't...
I don't think I can.

27:14.135 --> 27:15.400
Sarah said not to.

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
Listen, buddy...

27:21.700 --> 27:23.300
I started training
under Ty Bennett

27:23.335 --> 27:25.100
when I was 23 years old.

27:26.800 --> 27:28.400
I was an idiot back then.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.200
I wasn't good enough
to qualify for his program,

27:31.235 --> 27:32.265
but he took me on anyway.

27:32.300 --> 27:34.600
You know, so, he taught me
everything I know-

27:34.635 --> 27:36.100
self-discipline,

27:36.135 --> 27:37.100
duty.

27:38.800 --> 27:40.000
I don't know
what to think here, pal.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.300
I'm feeling kind of exposed.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.900
I feel like my whole foundation
has been undermined here.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.900
He was like, a...

27:51.100 --> 27:52.965
I can't talk about this
over the phone.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.400
No, no, I'm glad you're finally
opening up to me.

27:55.500 --> 27:56.400
Be right there.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.400
Thanks, buddy.

28:02.100 --> 28:02.865
Hey...

28:02.900 --> 28:05.400
Hey, buddy, I'm sorry, I got
here as fast as I could.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.765
And I wanted
to tell you seriously

28:06.800 --> 28:08.000
what I was saying
on the phone earlier-

28:08.035 --> 28:08.965
I am sorry, man.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.900
I know, your sensei from the
past... it's very personal...

28:11.935 --> 28:13.465
- Yeah.
- Hey! Hey!

28:13.500 --> 28:14.800
Let go.
What are you doing?

28:15.500 --> 28:17.465
Oh, oh, gentle.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.800
Now, Intersect, flash.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.800
This is the surveillance
footage from the crash.

28:21.835 --> 28:23.300
Casey, it doesn't work
like that, okay?

28:23.335 --> 28:25.000
I can't just flash on cue...

28:34.600 --> 28:36.900
Okay, okay,
1919 Mulholland Drive.

28:36.935 --> 28:37.865
It's a martial arts dojo,

28:37.900 --> 28:39.600
but also a cover for
Bennett's illegal activity.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.700
Good work, Intersect.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.100
You know, I think
you should reconsider

28:44.135 --> 28:45.665
this whole cooling-off period.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.550
I think General Beckman was
onto something when she said you

28:47.585 --> 28:49.400
- should stay down here...
- Come on, I need that eyeball.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.665
Casey, what has
gotten into you?!

28:57.700 --> 28:59.500
What is going on? This is
totally uncharacteristic...

28:59.535 --> 29:00.765
I've never seen you
disobey an order.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.800
What are you, nuts,
crazy, out of your mind?

29:03.200 --> 29:04.900
Okay, that's it-
I'm calling Sarah.

29:04.935 --> 29:05.665
You know what, Chuck?

29:05.700 --> 29:07.800
I think I might owe
you an apology now.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.600
That's very nice of you.

29:09.635 --> 29:10.265
Huh? What's it for?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.700
The lying, the name-calling,
the emotional manipulation?

29:12.735 --> 29:14.000
Nope. For this.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.065
Wait, no, no.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.065
No, Casey, no, no, no, wait,
wait wait. You don't understand.

29:19.100 --> 29:21.900
I have dinner with Ellie tonight and we're tasting food
for her wedding.

29:21.935 --> 29:22.865
I can't miss it.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.200
You know, when I was
Bennett's student,

29:24.235 --> 29:25.800
I struggled with my calm.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.900
He said I held too much anger
and that made me weak.

29:29.800 --> 29:31.700
Sometimes when I see
your face, Bartowski,

29:31.735 --> 29:33.800
my calm center just wants to...

29:36.300 --> 29:37.700
You tell anyone where I'm going,

29:38.400 --> 29:39.700
and this is yours.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.400
What? Hey!

29:52.300 --> 29:54.600
Use the Force.
Use the Force, Chuck.

29:58.900 --> 30:01.500
So, you're sure it's all right
to start without Chuck?

30:01.800 --> 30:04.600
- Yeah, he has a tendency to run late.
- Yeah, it's like the kid's

30:04.635 --> 30:06.100
in his own world
half the time.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.965
Must drive you crazy, Sarah.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.550
Oh, I'm pretty
used to it, actually.

30:10.585 --> 30:13.100
And Chuck always
has a good excuse.

30:13.300 --> 30:15.500
So we are all
in agreement then?

30:15.600 --> 30:16.965
Yes to the trout,

30:17.000 --> 30:18.500
<i>no to the beef au jus.</i>

30:18.600 --> 30:20.100
And what was
your favorite cake, Ellie?

30:20.135 --> 30:22.165
- Um...
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.200
- Let's agree on the red velvet.
- Big fan.

30:24.235 --> 30:25.500
And I love sorbet
between courses.

30:25.535 --> 30:26.665
Great idea, Woody.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.300
So, are you going
to wear your hair up?

30:28.335 --> 30:29.065
Wait a second...

30:29.100 --> 30:30.600
I just had
a brilliant idea.

30:30.700 --> 30:31.665
White ties.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.465
Woody looks so handsome
in a white tie.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.250
- That's not too formal is it?
- I don't know.

30:35.285 --> 30:36.965
And I know you're not
in contact with your dad,

30:37.000 --> 30:42.100
so I would be honored, really,
to walk you down the aisle on your wedding day.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.800
You know, guys, maybe we should
just table the wedding talk.

30:46.835 --> 30:48.165
Um, no.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.000
I have something
I'd like to say, actually.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.300
Um, I said yes to the big
wedding and I said yes

30:54.335 --> 30:57.000
to the burgundy organza
bridesmaid dresses,

30:57.035 --> 30:59.965
and I just can't
say yes anymore.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.200
And I'm sorry, I know that
you're trying to help,

31:02.235 --> 31:03.800
but the answer is no.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.100
I'm sorry... I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.300
Babe...

31:09.500 --> 31:10.500
Sorry.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.000
Sweetie...

31:12.035 --> 31:13.100
sweetheart...

31:13.200 --> 31:14.100
Sweetheart?

31:19.100 --> 31:20.100
Well, Sarah...

31:21.500 --> 31:23.200
so you're in the yogurt game?

31:23.235 --> 31:24.100
Yeah.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.600
Yeah, yogurt.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.700
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

31:31.900 --> 31:34.600
Yeah, yeah.

31:35.400 --> 31:36.200
Yes.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.900
- Woody...
- Huh?

31:50.000 --> 31:54.200
I think we should go for a walk
and give the kids some time to themselves.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.965
Oh, it's Ellie's phone.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.500
Oh, it's Chuck.
Should I answer it?

31:59.535 --> 32:01.100
Oh, I'll take it.
Thank you.

32:02.100 --> 32:04.200
Hey, Chuck, where are you?

32:04.400 --> 32:06.400
Sarah, Sarah, thank God.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.065
Listen, um...

32:07.100 --> 32:08.165
Casey threatened my life,

32:08.200 --> 32:09.965
- so technically I can't tell you...
- What?

32:10.000 --> 32:12.600
Well, you could guess though.
Yeah, you could guess.

32:12.635 --> 32:14.100
Chuck,
I don't have time for games.

32:14.135 --> 32:14.765
Just guess!

32:14.800 --> 32:17.700
I'll tell you if you're
hot or cold.

32:17.735 --> 32:18.265
And FYI,

32:18.300 --> 32:19.765
this place is very cold.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.700
It's... it's practically frozen.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.050
You're at Orange Orange.

32:23.085 --> 32:24.300
Bingo! Yes, you're amazing!

32:24.400 --> 32:26.400
Let me guess- you went down
into the Castle and Casey

32:26.435 --> 32:27.365
used you to get out and
then he locked you

32:27.400 --> 32:29.700
in the Orange Orange and now
he's going after Bennett.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.200
Wow. That's very impressive.
How did you...?

32:32.235 --> 32:34.265
Okay. Where did he go?

32:34.300 --> 32:36.600
You didn't hear this from me.
1919 Mulholland Drive.

32:36.635 --> 32:37.700
Can you get out?

32:37.800 --> 32:39.065
No. No. Not until
you get down here

32:39.100 --> 32:40.800
and get the key to get me
out of these handcuffs.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.365
Good. Then stay there.

32:42.400 --> 32:45.000
What? No, no, no! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait, Sarah! No, no! Wait!

33:26.700 --> 33:28.800
<i>Those seven years of MacGyver
finally paid off.</i>

33:36.800 --> 33:38.600
You shouldn't be here.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.200
You want to stop me,
you're going to have to kill me.

33:40.235 --> 33:41.165
Well, I'm your partner,

33:41.200 --> 33:43.200
and I'm not letting
you go in alone.

33:46.000 --> 33:46.700
Okay.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.200
Come on.

34:01.500 --> 34:04.900
Um... computer emergency?

34:26.699 --> 34:27.800
I was waiting in the car.

34:28.800 --> 34:29.699
I swear.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.500
Hello, John.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.300
And friends.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.000
This is unfortunate.

34:50.100 --> 34:51.900
No matter where you run, where you hide,

34:52.800 --> 34:53.800
I'm going
to be there,

34:54.199 --> 34:54.900
waiting.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.300
Please be careful.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.600
Always so proud,

34:59.100 --> 35:01.100
so righteous, John.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.500
But I have business to attend to.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.600
I can't have you interfering.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.000
I thought you
were a man of honor.

35:08.400 --> 35:10.100
If I'm not good enough
to make your team,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
surely you could defeat me without the gun.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.000
Withhonor.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.500
You're right.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.000
My students,

35:19.100 --> 35:21.065
this is a special lesson:

35:21.100 --> 35:26.200
How to kill a man with honor.
It will happen

35:26.700 --> 35:27.900
very quickly.

35:29.700 --> 35:31.000
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

35:31.035 --> 35:32.200
Shut up, Chuck.

35:32.600 --> 35:33.400
Sorry.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.000
We're in trouble, aren't we?

36:11.400 --> 36:13.800
Use the snake on him.
Get around him.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.500
Come on!
Come on!

36:19.535 --> 36:20.567
Casey, hit him!

36:20.602 --> 36:21.600
He's outmatched.

36:30.600 --> 36:32.500
You lost your calm, John.

36:33.200 --> 36:34.100
Your center

36:34.200 --> 36:35.800
is filled with conflict.

36:37.300 --> 36:38.200
That's it.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.450
Casey... Casey!
Casey, you gotta get up.

36:42.485 --> 36:44.600
- You gotta get up.
- Run for it, Chuck. Go.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.000
It's too bad,
really.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.265
I was hoping my
men would see

36:47.300 --> 36:49.700
better skills
from a former student of mine.

36:50.100 --> 36:52.100
Look. Look, I get how you're
feeling, man. I totally

36:52.135 --> 36:54.100
get how you're feeling.
You're feeling betrayed

36:54.200 --> 36:55.600
by someone that
you really care about.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.865
You're damaging my calm, Chuck.

36:57.900 --> 37:00.800
You've spent so much of your life-
pushing people away.

37:00.835 --> 37:04.000
Lashing out with purple words
and... and punches.

37:04.035 --> 37:05.065
But I know why you do it.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.800
You do it because you're scared.

37:06.835 --> 37:07.565
What?

37:07.600 --> 37:09.265
Scared. Scared to be known.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.800
Scared that, if we see
who you really are,

37:10.835 --> 37:12.500
we'd actually care about you.

37:12.600 --> 37:13.465
You shut up!

37:13.500 --> 37:15.100
Yeah. Shut up, Chuck.
You're making him mad.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.100
Underneath that extremely
terrifying exterior lies a man

37:19.135 --> 37:21.167
who deeply, deeply feels.

37:21.202 --> 37:23.200
You care. You care about us.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.200
You care about me.
Admit it. You feel all

37:25.235 --> 37:26.700
warm and mushy about me.

37:26.900 --> 37:28.600
Go ahead. Say it.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.500
You love me, John Casey.

37:31.800 --> 37:32.665
I'm going to kill you!

37:32.700 --> 37:36.500
Wait, wait, wait! Hold on.
No. Not me.

37:37.100 --> 37:37.800
Him.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.600
Nice work, sensei.

37:51.400 --> 37:51.765
Yeah. Well,

37:51.800 --> 37:54.200
the thing is, Casey doesn't
really have a calm center.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.900
It's more of an angry center.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.300
There he is.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.165
There's your sensei.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.400
Take a good
look at him.

38:15.400 --> 38:16.400
Who's next?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.500
Hands on your heads!

38:27.700 --> 38:29.100
You called Beckman.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.600
What? It's not my fault.

38:32.800 --> 38:33.800
She guessed.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.800
<i>And now it's time
to announce this month's</i>

38:38.835 --> 38:40.500
Employee of the Month.

38:41.200 --> 38:45.800
And, for what
it's worth, you all tried your... best.

38:50.900 --> 38:52.600
The employee with
the highest level

38:52.635 --> 38:55.200
of customer service is...

38:56.900 --> 38:58.100
Skip Johnson!

39:00.600 --> 39:03.300
It's not my fault.
I tried to be a jerk.

39:03.335 --> 39:05.100
Oh, congratulations!

39:05.700 --> 39:08.200
Clearly, there is no prize that I could
give you

39:08.600 --> 39:11.165
that would compare to the satisfaction
of having

39:11.200 --> 39:16.700
your name and photo immortalized
on a Buy More plaque.

39:16.735 --> 39:17.600
What did I tell ya?

39:17.635 --> 39:19.100
So lame.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.165
However,
please accept

39:22.200 --> 39:25.900
this one-time only bonus gift.

39:29.500 --> 39:33.600
A 65-inch flat screen TV.

39:40.600 --> 39:43.200
Well, thanks for saving my life
today, Chuck.

39:43.235 --> 39:44.465
Anytime, Casey.
Yeah.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.700
You know what?
You're my friend.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.700
Yeah. You know what?
You're my friend, too.

39:47.800 --> 39:48.365
Well, that's really kind

39:48.400 --> 39:50.200
of you, Casey.
Have a good night.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.600
Thank you.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.300
You said something, didn't you?
You said something.

39:58.335 --> 39:59.300
You said something!

40:00.200 --> 40:03.100
I heard that. I heard that.

40:05.300 --> 40:06.200
Hey.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.300
Sorry I missed
tonight.

40:08.600 --> 40:09.900
I got stuck at work.

40:10.500 --> 40:12.000
It's okay.
Sarah told me.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.600
Uh... Where are
Awesome's parents?

40:15.900 --> 40:19.700
He's, um... he's taking
them to the airport.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.800
I really am sorry about
missing the dinner, Ell.

40:24.100 --> 40:25.765
I mean, I know
it's important for you

40:25.800 --> 40:28.200
to let your future in-laws
meet your family and...

40:28.235 --> 40:29.300
You know, I, um...

40:29.900 --> 40:31.265
I've never been
one of those girls

40:31.300 --> 40:34.900
that dreamed about what
their wedding day would be like.

40:35.800 --> 40:36.900
What I would wear.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.350
Even the person
that I would marry.

40:40.385 --> 40:43.100
It was all kind
of, uh... kind of hazy.

40:43.500 --> 40:47.500
Except... except
one thing was clear-

40:48.300 --> 40:50.600
That Dad would walk me
down the aisle.

40:51.400 --> 40:52.500
Hey, Ellie.

40:56.300 --> 40:57.665
I know it's not
going to happen.

40:57.700 --> 41:01.100
It's just... it's just really
hard to let go of that.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.700
ALWAYS THINKING OF YOU.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.

41:28.100 --> 41:31.400
The number you have reached
is not in service.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.500
What is it?

41:41.600 --> 41:43.100
Dad's going to walk
you down the aisle.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.200
You can't say that, Chuck.

41:48.300 --> 41:49.965
I know that you
want that for me,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.800
but we haven't heard from him
in a really long time.

41:53.835 --> 41:55.000
Yeah. Well,
I'm going to find him.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.100
I'm a smart guy.

41:57.135 --> 41:58.000
I can do that.

41:59.000 --> 41:59.900
And, when he hears
about the wedding,

41:59.935 --> 42:01.200
he'll be here for you.

42:02.300 --> 42:04.300
Come on. You really
think he's going to make it?

42:05.100 --> 42:06.165
I guarantee it.
