<i>Beverly Weston:
"Life is very long..."</i>

00:22.179 --> 00:23.683
<i>TS Eliot.</i>

00:25.905 --> 00:27.674
<i>Not the first person to say it,</i>

00:27.756 --> 00:29.851
<i>certainly not the first
person to think it.</i>

00:29.852 --> 00:33.335
<i>But he's given credit for it because
he bothered to write it down.</i>

00:36.514 --> 00:40.607
<i>Now, if you say it,
you have to say his name after it.</i>

00:41.811 --> 00:44.535
<i>"Life is very long:" TS Eliot.</i>

00:44.536 --> 00:46.585
<i>Absolutely, goddamn right.</i>

00:52.103 --> 00:53.484
Violet.

00:54.681 --> 00:56.234
My wife.

00:56.734 --> 00:58.499
She takes pills,

01:00.071 --> 01:02.028
sometimes a great many.

01:04.302 --> 01:06.266
The facts are:

01:06.282 --> 01:08.449
my wife takes pills and I drink.

01:08.450 --> 01:09.949
That's the bargain we've struck, a
little paragraph of our marriage contract...

01:13.423 --> 01:15.155
Rather than..

01:15.519 --> 01:18.974
once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed.

01:19.956 --> 01:24.905
I've chosen to turn my life over
to a Higher Power..

01:25.100 --> 01:28.941
and join the ranks
of the Hiring Class.

01:31.962 --> 01:35.297
It's not a decision with
which I'm entirely comfortable.

01:36.299 --> 01:38.396
I mean, I know how to launder my..

01:39.063 --> 01:41.202
...dirty undies.
Done it all my life,

01:43.344 --> 01:48.567
but I'm finding that it's getting
in the way of my drinking.

01:48.568 --> 01:50.958
Violet: Bev?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.186
Yes.

01:53.251 --> 01:54.624
Did...

01:55.669 --> 01:57.332
..you..?

01:59.814 --> 02:02.434
Oh, goddamn it!

02:02.510 --> 02:06.403
Are the police here?
- Could you come here?

02:13.895 --> 02:15.835
Oh. Hello.

02:17.149 --> 02:19.909
Johnna, the young woman
I told you about.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.801
You tell me she's a woman.

02:22.935 --> 02:26.121
Wo-man. Wo-man.

02:26.122 --> 02:27.545
Whoa-man.

02:27.546 --> 02:29.913
That I'm hiring --
- Oh,

02:30.320 --> 02:32.333
you hire women's now the thing.

02:32.334 --> 02:34.131
I thought you meant the other.

02:34.312 --> 02:37.229
To cook and clean,
carry you to the clinic..

02:38.779 --> 02:41.656
Hello.
- Hello.

02:41.657 --> 02:44.073
I'm sorry.

02:44.925 --> 02:46.302
Like this.

02:46.303 --> 02:47.802
Yes, ma'am.

02:51.322 --> 02:53.015
You're very pretty.

02:53.016 --> 02:54.515
Thank you.

02:55.617 --> 02:57.392
Are you an <i> Injun</i> ?

02:57.393 --> 02:59.966
Yes, ma'am.

02:59.967 --> 03:03.640
What kind?
- Cheyenne.

03:07.030 --> 03:09.790
Do you think I'm pretty?

03:09.791 --> 03:11.290
Like this?

03:13.589 --> 03:16.539
Like..
- Careful...Careful...!

03:24.558 --> 03:27.352
I'm sorry,
I took some...

03:27.805 --> 03:29.772
medicine for my mumm...

03:31.252 --> 03:33.188
for my mus...

03:35.055 --> 03:37.067
My muscular.

03:37.823 --> 03:39.404
..for my muscular.

03:39.896 --> 03:41.433
Why don't you go back to bed,
sweetheart?

03:41.434 --> 03:45.638
Why don't you go fuck
a fucking sow's ass?

03:46.258 --> 03:47.685
All right.

03:51.919 --> 03:52.990
Oh..

03:52.991 --> 03:55.662
I'm sorry.

03:57.221 --> 03:59.361
I'll be sickly sweet.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.676
sickly sweet.

04:09.244 --> 04:12.937
I'm so sweet.

04:19.373 --> 04:21.052
I'm so..

04:21.219 --> 04:23.337
In-el-a...

04:23.762 --> 04:28.130
In-el-abrially sweet.

04:30.207 --> 04:34.030
We keep unusual hours here.

04:34.644 --> 04:37.140
My wife has been diagnosed
with a touch of..

04:37.141 --> 04:41.220
cancer and she'll need to be driven
to Tulsa for her final..

04:41.525 --> 04:43.069
chemotherapy treatments.

04:43.756 --> 04:45.142
What kind of cancer?

04:45.143 --> 04:48.095
Ah, My God, I nearly
neglected the punch line:

04:48.096 --> 04:49.784
mouth cancer.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.947
Do you have any questions?

04:54.587 --> 04:56.533
What pills does she take?
- Ohhh..

04:57.816 --> 04:59.560
Valium. Vicodin.

05:00.462 --> 05:03.979
Darvon, Darvocet. Percodan,
Percocet..

05:03.980 --> 05:05.617
Xanax for fun.

05:05.865 --> 05:08.447
OxyContin in a pinch.

05:09.837 --> 05:13.930
And of course, Diluadid.
I can't forget Diluadid.

05:17.523 --> 05:19.292
My last refuge, my books..

05:21.287 --> 05:23.395
simple pleasures,

05:24.473 --> 05:25.993
like finding..

05:27.086 --> 05:31.436
wild onions by the side of a road,
or requited love.

05:33.540 --> 05:34.911
Oh here..

05:35.280 --> 05:38.205
Here, TS Eliot.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.408
Read it or not.
It's not a job requirement

05:41.409 --> 05:45.892
just for your enjoyment.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.436
Here we go,
round the prickly pear...

05:57.293 --> 05:59.215
Prickly pear prickly pear...

06:00.848 --> 06:03.844
ere we go,
round the prickly pear...

06:15.928 --> 06:19.325

Custom subtitle by

07:28.193 --> 07:30.228
Mom...?

07:32.037 --> 07:33.911
Mom..

07:34.870 --> 07:36.775
Mom...!

07:36.776 --> 07:38.302
You didn't hear the phone?

07:38.457 --> 07:41.376
If it's your father,
tell him to fuck off.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.954
It's Aunt Ivy,

07:42.955 --> 07:45.922
from Oklahoma.

07:54.801 --> 07:56.227
...Ivy?

07:56.538 --> 07:58.181
..what's wrong?

08:02.688 --> 08:04.201
..When...?

08:27.760 --> 08:29.917
What'd you tell Barb?

08:30.055 --> 08:31.860
I told her Dad was missing.

08:32.841 --> 08:36.322
Goddamn your father,
for putting me through this.

08:36.323 --> 08:37.842
Seen that office of his?

08:37.969 --> 08:43.317
He hired this Indian for some goddamn reason
and now I have a stranger in my house.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.226
What's her name?

08:45.227 --> 08:46.726
Johnna.

08:47.975 --> 08:49.883
I can't handle this all by myself!

08:51.657 --> 08:53.541
I called Karen.

08:53.547 --> 08:54.635
Oh..

08:54.636 --> 08:59.323
Yeah, What did she say?
- She said she'd try to get here.

09:00.060 --> 09:01.608
She'll be a big fat help,

09:01.705 --> 09:03.722
just like you.

09:05.955 --> 09:09.259
I need Barb.

09:09.260 --> 09:10.767
What's Barb going to be able to do?

09:16.330 --> 09:18.053
What did you do to your hair?

09:18.212 --> 09:21.498
I had it straightened.
- Why would anybody do that?

09:21.842 --> 09:23.080
I just wanted a change.

09:23.081 --> 09:24.743
You're a pretty girl.

09:24.744 --> 09:26.883
Why don't you wear makeup?

09:26.884 --> 09:28.082
Do I need makeup?

09:28.083 --> 09:30.839
Every women needs makeup.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.416
Don't let anybody tell you different.
The only woman..

09:33.559 --> 09:37.454
pretty enough to go without makeup
was Elizabeth Taylor.

09:37.455 --> 09:40.324
and she wore a ton.

09:40.527 --> 09:42.921
Your shoulders are slumped and
your hair's all straighten out..

09:42.922 --> 09:44.858
..and you don't wear makeup.
You look like a lesbian.

09:44.859 --> 09:46.194
Mom.

09:46.195 --> 09:48.607
You could get a decent man
if you spruced up.A bit,

09:48.608 --> 09:50.789
that's all I'm saying.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.790
I'm not looking for a man.

10:03.713 --> 10:05.380
How many was that?

10:05.381 --> 10:07.950
I wasn't counting.

10:16.464 --> 10:17.992
Is your mouth burning?

10:17.993 --> 10:21.557
Like a son-of-a-bitch.
My tongue is on fire.

10:21.558 --> 10:23.538
Are you supposed to be smoking?

10:24.800 --> 10:27.659
Is anybody <i>supposed</i> to smoke?

10:36.354 --> 10:37.735
Are you scared?

10:47.086 --> 10:48.567
Course I'm scared.

10:53.474 --> 10:55.728
And you are a comfort, sweetheart.

10:58.511 --> 11:01.867
Thank God one of my girls stayed
close to home.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.943
In my day..

11:04.944 --> 11:07.009
family stayed together.

11:08.717 --> 11:12.478
Aunt Mattie Fae's here.
- She means to come in here..

11:12.479 --> 11:14.356
..and tell me what's what.

11:15.393 --> 11:17.004
I don't know how Uncle Charlie
puts up with it.

11:17.199 --> 11:18.812
He smokes a lot of grass.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.065
He does?

11:23.225 --> 11:26.356
He smokes <i>a lot</i> of grass.

11:27.444 --> 11:30.790
I told Vi, "Take all those goddamn books
 he's so fond of..

11:30.791 --> 11:33.805
..and make a big pile in the front
yard and have yourself a bonfire."

11:33.806 --> 11:36.121
You don't burn a man's books.

11:36.178 --> 11:38.292
You do, if the situation
calls for it.

11:38.933 --> 11:41.092
The man's books didn't do anything.

11:42.434 --> 11:46.614
You get any ideas about just up and taking off,
Charlie Aiken, you better believe..

11:46.615 --> 11:47.812
..that i'd have your..
- I'm not going anywhere.

11:47.813 --> 11:50.328
I'm saying if you did,

11:50.366 --> 11:54.903
I'll give you two days to get your head straight.
Then it's all going up in a blaze of glory.

11:56.526 --> 11:58.410
Not that, you have any
books lying around.

11:58.629 --> 12:00.585
I don't think I've ever seen you
read a book in my life.

12:00.747 --> 12:02.125
That bother you?

12:02.126 --> 12:04.283
What's the last book you read?

12:04.284 --> 12:05.973
Beverly was a teacher;

12:06.151 --> 12:09.064
teachers read books,
I'm in the upholstery business.

12:09.065 --> 12:10.564
Ah, sweetheart.

12:11.384 --> 12:13.388
Your daddy's done this before.

12:13.835 --> 12:17.036
Just takes off, no call, nothing.

12:17.217 --> 12:18.344
I told your mother,

12:18.345 --> 12:22.294
"You pack that son-of-a-bitch's bags and have
‘em waiting for him on the front porch."

12:22.562 --> 12:23.958
Where's your mother?

12:23.959 --> 12:25.529
Upstairs.

12:34.292 --> 12:37.143
He'll come back again,
I know he will,

12:37.144 --> 12:38.768
he always does.

12:38.905 --> 12:40.875
Beverly is a very complicated man.

12:41.453 --> 12:43.069
Kind of like Charles.

12:43.092 --> 12:46.638
Little Charles isn't complicated,
he's just unemployed.

12:47.446 --> 12:49.833
You don't think that
Little Charles and

12:50.081 --> 12:52.068
Beverly share some kind of...

12:52.803 --> 12:54.737
..complication.

12:55.178 --> 12:57.777
You have to be smart
to be complicated.

12:57.981 --> 13:00.047
Are you saying our boy isn't smart?

13:00.466 --> 13:03.053
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

13:03.054 --> 13:05.030
I'm sweating.

13:05.031 --> 13:06.649
Why is it so dark in here?

13:09.378 --> 13:10.605
Are you sweating?

13:10.606 --> 13:12.652
Hell, yes, I'm sweating,

13:13.751 --> 13:15.433
it's ninety degrees in here.

13:18.968 --> 13:20.760
Feel my back.

13:20.761 --> 13:21.959
I don't want to feel your back.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.149
Sweat is just dripping down my back.
- I believe you.

13:24.150 --> 13:25.649
Feel it.
- No.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.230
Come on, put your hand here.
- Goddamn it --

13:28.231 --> 13:32.117
Sweat's just dripping...

13:37.884 --> 13:39.490
Ivy, when did this start?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.757
This business with
taping the shades?

13:42.768 --> 13:44.426
Been a couple of years now.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.175
Do you know its purpose?

13:48.335 --> 13:50.322
You can't tell if
it's night or day.

13:50.323 --> 13:53.515
I think that's the purpose.

13:59.399 --> 14:02.189
What were these people thinking...

14:02.346 --> 14:04.118
The jokers who settled this place.

14:04.119 --> 14:09.572
Who was the asshole, looked at flat
hot nothing and planted his flag?

14:09.573 --> 14:11.391
I mean..

14:11.392 --> 14:13.773
we fucked the Indians for this?
- Well, genocide,

14:13.774 --> 14:16.551
always seems like such a good idea
at the time.

14:16.552 --> 14:19.173
Right, you need a little hindsight.

14:19.174 --> 14:21.062
If you want me to explain the creepy
character of the Midwest,

14:21.063 --> 14:23.156
Please, the Midwest.

14:23.157 --> 14:25.911
This is the Plains.

14:25.912 --> 14:31.664
A state of mind, A spiritual
affliction, like the Blues.

14:36.872 --> 14:39.244
Don't.

14:54.647 --> 14:56.580
What are you doing?

14:58.028 --> 15:02.646
‘Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you
for another beer?

15:02.647 --> 15:04.431
Goddam it, she's not a waitress.

15:04.432 --> 15:06.986
I'll get it.

15:08.355 --> 15:10.111
I know that.

15:10.981 --> 15:12.631
Then, get your own beer.

15:14.354 --> 15:15.906
I don't believe you.

15:16.577 --> 15:18.472
Watchin' a ball game,
drinkin' beers.

15:18.731 --> 15:20.996
You have any sense of
what's going on around you?

15:21.327 --> 15:24.139
Am I supposed to sit
here like a statue?

15:24.140 --> 15:25.783
You're drinking whiskey.

15:25.784 --> 15:27.970
I'm having a cocktail.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.711
You're drinking straight whiskey!

15:32.712 --> 15:33.880
Just...

15:33.881 --> 15:35.934
Have a little class.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.221
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

15:50.941 --> 15:52.552
You've encouraged that.

15:52.775 --> 15:56.480
I haven't encouraged anything.
- You admire her for getting hooked at fourteen,

15:57.167 --> 15:59.067
makes her seem even more mature.

16:01.893 --> 16:03.545
Goddamn, it's hot.

16:05.088 --> 16:07.811
Suppose your mom's turned on
the air conditioner?

16:07.812 --> 16:09.568
You kidding?
Remember the parakeets?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.779
The parakeets?

16:11.780 --> 16:13.361
I didn't tell you
about the parakeets?

16:14.011 --> 16:18.773
She got a parakeet, for some insane reason
 and the little fucker croaked after two days.

16:18.941 --> 16:20.864
So, she went to the pet store
and raised hell,

16:20.865 --> 16:23.743
and they gave her another one.
That one died after a day.

16:24.044 --> 16:27.419
Then, she went back and they gave her
a third parakeet. That one died too.

16:27.490 --> 16:31.972
So, the chick from the pet store came
out here to see just what in the hell

16:32.197 --> 16:35.355
this, serial parakeet killer was
doing to bump off these birds.

16:35.356 --> 16:36.553
And?

16:36.554 --> 16:37.659
The heat.

16:37.660 --> 16:40.708
It was too hot.
They were dying from the heat.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.907
Jesus.

16:41.908 --> 16:43.106
These are tropical birds,
all right?

16:43.107 --> 16:46.675
I mean, They live in
the fucking tropics!

16:46.676 --> 16:47.874
Mom?!

16:47.875 --> 16:49.073
It's Barbara..it's Barb.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.573
Barbara!

16:51.327 --> 16:52.704
Oh my gosh!

16:52.705 --> 16:53.903
You.

16:53.904 --> 16:56.612
Come give me some sugar.

16:56.671 --> 17:00.374
Bill, look how skinny you are!

17:01.956 --> 17:04.074
Will you look at this one?

17:04.134 --> 17:06.080
Come here and give your Aunt Mattie
Fae some sugar!

17:06.082 --> 17:07.280
Hi, Charlie.
- Hey Bill,

17:07.281 --> 17:10.914
you've dropped some
weight, haven't you?

17:12.795 --> 17:15.461
Look at her boobs! - Last time I saw..
<I>- How was the flight from Denver? </I>

17:15.462 --> 17:16.660
you looked like a little boy!

17:16.661 --> 17:18.049
Barbara?

17:18.050 --> 17:21.694
Hey, Mom. I'm here!

17:21.695 --> 17:25.905
Barb...Barb..Barb..
- It's okay, Mom.I'm here.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.878
Saturday morning.

17:30.328 --> 17:33.928
The Indian girl made us biscuits and gravy.
We ate some,

17:33.929 --> 17:36.452
he walked out the door,
this door right there.

17:40.098 --> 17:41.916
That was it.

17:42.196 --> 17:43.844
He just left...?

17:44.593 --> 17:46.202
uh, huh.

17:47.720 --> 17:50.018
I went to bed Saturday night,

17:50.837 --> 17:53.515
got up Sunday mornin'

17:53.634 --> 17:55.753
... still no Beverly.

17:56.811 --> 17:58.360
I didn't make much of it,

17:59.129 --> 18:01.147
thought he'd gone out on a bender.

18:02.226 --> 18:04.254
Why would he do that?
When, he can drink at home.

18:05.422 --> 18:08.546
Unless, you were riding his ass.
- I never said a word to him..

18:08.547 --> 18:11.444
about his drinking, I didn't.
I never got on him about it.

18:11.445 --> 18:12.944
So, Sunday,

18:13.474 --> 18:16.652
still no sign of him...
- That's when I got worked up about that,

18:17.510 --> 18:20.328
safety deposit box. Because..

18:20.547 --> 18:24.695
We kept an awful lot of cash in
that box, some expensive jewelry.

18:24.696 --> 18:25.701
I had a..

18:25.702 --> 18:30.555
diamond ring in that box appraised
at over seven thousand dollars.

18:30.556 --> 18:32.306
Wait, wait, wait,
I'm missing something.

18:32.395 --> 18:34.372
Why do you care about a safety
deposit box?

18:34.373 --> 18:36.472
Your father and I
had an arrangement.

18:36.851 --> 18:41.886
If something were to ever happen to one of us,
the other one would go empty that box.

18:42.226 --> 18:46.262
Vi, you sure there wasn't some incident
that triggered his leaving, some event.

18:46.311 --> 18:48.070
like a fight?
- Yeah. - No.

18:48.339 --> 18:52.671
And we fought enough...
you know... but no.

18:55.243 --> 18:57.061
Maybe he needed some
time away from you.

18:57.191 --> 18:59.790
Oh, That's nice of you to say.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.515
Hey, it's no crime.

19:01.516 --> 19:03.025
Marriage is hard.

19:03.026 --> 19:05.886
Under the best of circumstances.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.548
So..

19:11.057 --> 19:13.894
Nothing? No,<i> 'see you later,
I'm taking a walk'</i> ?

19:14.403 --> 19:15.801
Mmmmhm.

19:15.802 --> 19:19.029
Good old unfathomable Dad.

19:19.838 --> 19:23.505
Oh. That man. Oh..

19:24.413 --> 19:27.701
What I first fell in love with,
you know, was his mystery.

19:27.830 --> 19:31.177
I thought it was sexy as hell.

19:32.545 --> 19:37.181
You knew he was the smartest one in the room,
knew if he just said something...

19:39.308 --> 19:43.673
knock you out.
But No, he'd just stand there,

19:43.764 --> 19:45.333
little smile on his face...

19:46.571 --> 19:48.070
not say a word.

19:50.942 --> 19:53.902
Sexy.

19:56.072 --> 19:58.140
You can't remember
anything unusual --

19:58.739 --> 20:00.837
He hired this woman.

20:01.962 --> 20:07.259
He didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come
live in our house. Few days before he left.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.928
You don't want her here?

20:08.929 --> 20:10.628
I have an <i>Indian</i> in my house.

20:11.656 --> 20:13.425
You have a problem
with Indians, Violet?

20:13.824 --> 20:16.012
I don't know what to say to an Indian.
- They're called Native Americans, Mom.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.662
Who makes that decision?
- It's what they like to be called.

20:19.663 --> 20:22.145
They aren't any more native than me.
- In fact,

20:22.975 --> 20:25.371
..they are.
- What's wrong with Indian?

20:25.372 --> 20:26.709
Why can't you call people
what they wanna be called?

20:26.710 --> 20:30.381
Let's just call the dinosaurs
"Native Americans" while we're at it.

20:32.006 --> 20:36.049
She may be an Indian, but she makes
the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

20:36.632 --> 20:40.616
He hired a cook.
It makes no sense. We don't eat.

20:40.617 --> 20:43.351
And now you get biscuits and gravy.
Kind of nice, huh?

20:43.352 --> 20:44.702
That is nice.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.477
Nice for you, now.

20:46.521 --> 20:48.151
But, soon you'll be gone,

20:48.152 --> 20:50.676
never to return.

20:50.677 --> 20:52.534
When was the last
time you were here?

20:52.535 --> 20:53.776
Don't get started..
- Alright!

20:53.777 --> 20:54.975
I don't care about you two.

20:54.976 --> 20:58.064
But, I'd like to see my
granddaughter every now and again.

20:58.065 --> 20:59.262
Well, you're seeing her now.

20:59.263 --> 21:01.985
But your father.
You broke his heart when you moved away.

21:01.986 --> 21:05.782
That is wildly unfair! -You know you were Beverly's favorite;
- Am I going to have to separate you two?

21:05.783 --> 21:08.423
 ..don't pretend you don't know!

21:08.424 --> 21:12.868
I'd prefer to think my parents loved
all their children equally.

21:16.168 --> 21:21.617
I'm sure you'd prefer to think that Santy Claus
brought you presents at Christmas, too.

21:22.955 --> 21:24.853
If you'd had more than one child, you'd know

21:24.913 --> 21:26.582
a parent always has favorites.

21:27.150 --> 21:31.227
Mattie Fae was my mother's favorite.
Big deal. I got used to it.

21:32.105 --> 21:33.513
You were your Daddy's favorite.

21:33.514 --> 21:36.353
Broke his heart.

21:36.821 --> 21:38.450
What was I supposed to do?!

21:39.488 --> 21:42.779
Colorado gave Bill twice what he's making at TU.
- Why are we even getting into this?

21:42.780 --> 21:45.406
You think Daddy wouldn't have
jumped at an opportunity like that?

21:45.407 --> 21:48.831
You're wrong there. You never would've
gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.

21:48.832 --> 21:50.030
He gave me his blessing.

21:50.031 --> 21:52.434
That's what he told you. Yeah..

21:52.435 --> 21:56.720
And now, you're going to tell me the true story,
some terrible shit he said behind my back?

21:56.721 --> 21:58.220
Alright, everybody's on edge..

21:58.239 --> 22:01.646
Beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back
- Vi, come on!

22:01.647 --> 22:05.805
He just told me he's disappointed
in you because you settled.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.748
He thought you had talent,

22:08.749 --> 22:11.415
..as a writer.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.620
Daddy never said anything like that to you.

22:13.621 --> 22:15.811
What a load of absolute horseshit.

22:15.812 --> 22:17.201
horseshit.

22:17.700 --> 22:22.414
Horseshit? Oh, horseshit,
let's all say horseshit.

22:22.415 --> 22:25.325
Say horseshit, Bill.

22:27.081 --> 22:29.342
Horseshit.

22:37.430 --> 22:39.951
Are you high?
- Excuse me.

22:39.952 --> 22:41.451
I mean literally.
You taking something?

22:43.604 --> 22:47.276
A muscle relaxer.
- You listen to me. I'll not go through this with you again.

22:47.277 --> 22:48.468
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:48.469 --> 22:54.284
These fucking pills? Calls at three
AM about stars in your backyard?

22:54.433 --> 22:56.751
This isn't..it isn't same thing.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.089
I didn't have reason then.

22:59.548 --> 23:02.721
So, it's okay to get hooked now
because you have a reason.

23:02.722 --> 23:03.920
I'm not hooked on anything.

23:03.921 --> 23:06.193
I don't want to know
if you are or not,

23:06.194 --> 23:09.077
I'm just saying.. I'm not gonna
go through it again.

23:09.078 --> 23:12.139
I'm not. I'm in pain!

23:13.054 --> 23:14.602
Because of your mouth?

23:14.603 --> 23:18.288
Yes, because my mouth burns.

23:18.289 --> 23:19.627
I have got..

23:19.628 --> 23:21.546
Cancer in my mouth.

23:21.776 --> 23:23.673
And it burns, look.

23:23.674 --> 23:25.031
Look.

23:25.032 --> 23:28.370
And it burns like a... bullshit.

23:33.104 --> 23:36.983
And Beverly's disappeared and
you're yelling at me.

23:36.984 --> 23:38.483
I'm not..

23:43.924 --> 23:47.896
You know, you couldn't come home
when I got cancer.

23:51.366 --> 23:53.175
Beverlys disappeared..

23:55.262 --> 23:57.953
you rushed right back.

24:06.321 --> 24:07.710
I'm sorry.

24:15.886 --> 24:17.844
I'm sorry...

24:20.037 --> 24:22.400
You know where I think he is?

24:24.503 --> 24:26.072
I think he..

24:27.710 --> 24:30.617
I think he got some whiskey,
a carton of cigarettes, and

24:31.166 --> 24:32.675
a couple of good spy novels...and..

24:34.403 --> 24:36.052
I think he got out on the boat.

24:36.731 --> 24:38.739
and steered it to a nice spot,
close to shore like he likes em.

24:42.365 --> 24:44.923
and he's fishing, and reading
and drinking,

24:45.412 --> 24:47.411
maybe even writing a little.

24:50.477 --> 24:52.006
And, I think..

24:52.135 --> 24:54.154
he's gonna walk through that door..

24:56.713 --> 24:59.314
...any time.

26:04.393 --> 26:06.282
Mom?

26:07.680 --> 26:09.017
Mom, the sheriff's here.

26:09.018 --> 26:10.517
What? Wha...

26:17.380 --> 26:20.387
Hey, sweetheart.
Go back to bed.

26:57.470 --> 26:59.278
What about Aunt Ivy?

27:00.902 --> 27:02.705
I guess we'll stop on the way.

27:03.586 --> 27:06.164
Christ, I have to call Karen too.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.029
Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

27:22.750 --> 27:25.746
Izza story.

27:28.963 --> 27:31.063
Barely's back.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.682
Gizza cig...

27:34.683 --> 27:39.313
cigezze?  Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
- Ma'am?

27:39.338 --> 27:41.834
Gizza cig...

27:41.835 --> 27:44.332
Cig-zezz, cig-zizz...
some cigezze?

27:44.333 --> 27:47.116
Cigz, cig-aa..

27:53.509 --> 27:56.505
archa-tex?

27:58.010 --> 28:00.787
I'm Inna bottom of them.

28:10.317 --> 28:13.714
It's good beat, right?

28:13.743 --> 28:19.084
Barb..!

28:19.678 --> 28:22.255
From the day I..

28:23.629 --> 28:27.066
..the day..

28:34.008 --> 28:38.549
Beverly..

28:39.772 --> 28:42.131
and then..

28:42.739 --> 28:47.101
and then you're here..

28:49.338 --> 28:51.834
And Barbara, you're here, and Beverly,
and then you're here, and then..

28:51.835 --> 28:57.750
..you're here..

29:04.369 --> 29:06.371
I used to go out with that boy.

29:06.372 --> 29:11.057
That man.
- What man? The Sheriff?

29:11.745 --> 29:14.973
In high school.
He was my prom date.

29:15.477 --> 29:18.834
You're kidding.

29:18.838 --> 29:21.199
Day of the prom, his father
got drunk and stole his car,

29:21.948 --> 29:23.718
stole his own son's car,

29:23.719 --> 29:26.381
went somewhere, Mexico.

29:27.495 --> 29:31.187
Deon showed up at the house.
He'd been crying.

29:32.425 --> 29:35.705
Confessed he didn't have a way
to take me to the prom.

29:36.036 --> 29:37.856
So, we got a six-pack..

29:37.857 --> 29:42.220
..and broke into the chapel, stayed
up all night talking and kissing.

29:44.792 --> 29:46.526
And, now here he is,

29:46.527 --> 29:49.438
..showing me.

29:49.977 --> 29:52.076
It's so surreal.

29:53.908 --> 29:56.841
Thank God we can't tell the future.
We'd never get out of bed.

30:13.109 --> 30:14.689
Listen to me.

30:17.879 --> 30:19.738
Die after me, all right?

30:22.575 --> 30:24.193
I don't care what else you do,

30:25.222 --> 30:29.242
where you go, how
you screw up your life, just...

30:33.583 --> 30:35.222
Survive.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.910
please.

32:09.937 --> 32:12.025
Holy shit, that's Karen.

32:13.314 --> 32:15.716
Do you remember your Aunt Karen?
- Kind of...

32:15.717 --> 32:19.522
That must be this year's man.

33:04.137 --> 33:06.888
I spent so much time
in our bedroom,

33:06.889 --> 33:09.219
pretending my pillow
was my husband..

33:09.220 --> 33:13.494
..and did he like the dinner I just made and
where were we going that winter on vacation..

33:13.495 --> 33:17.478
..and then, he'd surprise me with
tickets to Belize and we'd kiss.

33:17.479 --> 33:20.956
I mean I'd kiss my pillow!

33:21.685 --> 33:24.548
and then I'd say that
I'd been to the doctor that I am..

33:24.549 --> 33:26.048
maybe, I was pregnant.

33:26.590 --> 33:30.367
I know how pathetic that sounds now,
but it was innocent enough.

33:30.811 --> 33:33.308
Then real life kicks in,

33:33.309 --> 33:35.805
Things don't work out
like you planned.

33:35.806 --> 33:38.432
They never do..and then,

33:38.433 --> 33:42.325
That pillow was a better husband
than any real man I'd ever met;

33:42.839 --> 33:47.745
And you punish yourself and tell yourself
it's your fault you can't find a good one.

33:47.964 --> 33:50.409
I don't know how well you remember Andrew.
You remember Andrew?

33:50.410 --> 33:51.569
No, I remember him.

33:51.570 --> 33:54.067
I loved him.. so intensely,

33:54.068 --> 33:58.494
so, the things he did wrong, were just
opportunities for me to make 'em right.

33:58.548 --> 34:01.045
When he'd cheat on me
or called me a cunt,

34:01.046 --> 34:04.222
I'd say, <i>"No, love is forever,</i>

34:04.223 --> 34:06.940
<i>this is just an opportunity for me,</i>

34:06.941 --> 34:09.809
<i>..to make an adjustment in the
way that I view the world."</i>

34:09.810 --> 34:13.489
And thank God, one day I looked
in the mirror and said, "Moron,"

34:13.491 --> 34:15.455
and I walked out.

34:15.456 --> 34:17.824
But, one day..
finally I said,

34:17.974 --> 34:19.608
"It's me.

34:19.937 --> 34:21.761
It's just me.

34:22.170 --> 34:25.906
I don't need anything else,
I can live my life with myself."

34:26.016 --> 34:30.833
 And, that's how I got my license, I threw
myself into my work, sold a ton of houses,

34:30.835 --> 34:32.333
..and that's how I met Steve.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.208
That's how it works, Barb.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.406
Ah, he's ten years older,

34:38.407 --> 34:40.562
but he is such a thinker,

34:40.563 --> 34:41.761
 ..and he's such a good man.

34:41.762 --> 34:45.221
He's such a good heart
and he's good for me.

34:45.222 --> 34:49.148
I guess, the best thing
about him, for me,

34:49.387 --> 34:51.186
...is that now..

34:51.304 --> 34:53.204
..what I think about is now.

34:53.713 --> 34:55.232
I live now.

34:55.282 --> 34:58.878
My focus, my life, my world is now.

34:59.767 --> 35:03.173
And you can't plan the future.
You just can't. Cause as soon as you do,

35:03.174 --> 35:05.082
something happens, some..

35:05.881 --> 35:08.639
terrible thing happens..
- Like your father drowning himself.

35:08.928 --> 35:11.326
That's exactly what I mean.

35:11.815 --> 35:14.653
You take it as it comes,
here and now!

35:15.891 --> 35:21.785
Steve had a huge presentation today for
some big-wig government guys who could be..

35:21.785 --> 35:26.721
..really important for his business
and he's put together for months now,

35:26.830 --> 35:29.296
But.. as soon as we
found about Daddy,

35:29.297 --> 35:32.513
he just canceled his meeting.

35:32.514 --> 35:34.603
He has his priorities straight.

35:34.862 --> 35:36.511
And, you know what the kicker is?

35:37.479 --> 35:39.608
Do you know what the
kicker is Barb?

35:39.867 --> 35:41.420
What's the kicker?

35:41.421 --> 35:45.318
We're going to Belize
on our honeymoon!

36:02.724 --> 36:04.766
Is it always this hot?

36:08.024 --> 36:09.897
Usually, it's hotter.

36:12.307 --> 36:14.353
That's hard to imagine.

36:18.089 --> 36:21.443
How old are you, about,
seventeen?

36:22.980 --> 36:24.423
Fourteen.

36:24.424 --> 36:25.923
Fourteen, right...

36:30.806 --> 36:32.675
You know what I was doing
when I was fourteen?

36:33.413 --> 36:34.941
Cattle processing.

36:34.942 --> 36:38.199
Know what that is?
- It doesn't sound good.

36:38.408 --> 36:40.056
Slaughterhouse sanitation.

36:40.057 --> 36:41.556
That's disgusting.

36:41.615 --> 36:43.474
I wouldn't recommend it.

36:45.192 --> 36:47.390
But hey. Put food on the table.

36:49.192 --> 36:51.130
Get it?

36:55.821 --> 36:57.360
What's that smell?

36:57.549 --> 36:58.918
I don't know?

36:59.767 --> 37:01.765
It's probably, that stop thrash can
over there?

37:02.494 --> 37:04.153
Nah, that's not what I'm smelling.

37:07.150 --> 37:09.077
What are you doing?

37:09.078 --> 37:11.039
Do I smell what I think I smell?
- I don't know,

37:11.040 --> 37:12.539
What do you smell?
- Is that... pot?

37:12.654 --> 37:14.667
You smoking pot?

37:14.712 --> 37:16.630
No.
- You can tell me.

37:17.128 --> 37:19.736
You a little dope smoker?
- No!

37:19.737 --> 37:22.195
Then you are in luck.

37:22.914 --> 37:26.341
Because, I happen to have some
really tasty shit.

37:28.408 --> 37:29.906
Here we go!

37:29.907 --> 37:33.591
No Pinots, but they had some decent
California Merlots.

37:34.902 --> 37:40.368
Ahh! Look at me! Look at me.
- You're beautiful, Mom.

37:40.369 --> 37:42.505
I was beautiful.

37:43.114 --> 37:44.421
Hah..

37:44.422 --> 37:46.658
Not anymore.
- Oh, now --

37:46.659 --> 37:47.908
You're still beautiful.

37:47.909 --> 37:51.406
One of those lies we tell to give us comfort.

37:51.815 --> 37:55.851
Women are beautiful,
when they're young and not after.

37:56.021 --> 38:00.027
Men can still preserve their
sex appeal into old age.

38:00.346 --> 38:02.475
Not those men like
you see with shorts,

38:02.494 --> 38:06.660
and little purses around their waists.
- Lord..lord.

38:07.359 --> 38:13.712
Some men can maintain a weary masculinity.
Women just get old..

38:13.713 --> 38:16.341
..and fat and wrinkly.

38:16.550 --> 38:19.826
I beg your pardon?
I'm still very sexy.

38:19.827 --> 38:22.850
Thank you very much.
- Yeah, you're about as sexy

38:23.044 --> 38:24.831
as a wet cardboard box, Mattie Fae.

38:24.832 --> 38:27.506
you and me both.

38:27.507 --> 38:33.406
Look, wouldn't we be better off all of us,
if we stopped lying about these things,

38:33.407 --> 38:35.252
..and told the truth?

38:35.253 --> 38:37.650
"Women aren't sexy
when they're old."

38:37.651 --> 38:40.547
I can live with that.
Can you live with that?

38:40.548 --> 38:43.142
What about Sophia Loren?

38:43.143 --> 38:47.463
What about Lena Horne?
She stayed sexy till she was eighty.

38:47.464 --> 38:48.963
The world is round.

38:49.357 --> 38:50.956
Get over it.

38:51.765 --> 38:53.522
Hey, try this dress on.

38:53.523 --> 38:55.182
I'm sorry, I won't.

38:56.330 --> 38:59.209
You don't know how to
attract a man. I do.

38:59.210 --> 39:00.408
That's something I always..

39:00.409 --> 39:03.210
We just buried my father,
I'm not trying to attract a man.

39:03.211 --> 39:04.409
I'm not talking about today, dummy,
I'm just saying..

39:04.410 --> 39:06.793
this is something..
- I have a man. All right?

39:06.794 --> 39:07.992
I have a man.

39:07.993 --> 39:11.182
You said, you weren't
looking for a man.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.712
And I'm not.
Because I have one.

39:13.713 --> 39:17.298
Now will you leave it alone?
- No, I won't leave it alone. <i>- No, let's not leave it alone.</i>

39:17.299 --> 39:19.126
I wish you both could see,

39:19.127 --> 39:21.432
..the brainsick looks
on your faces.

39:21.433 --> 39:22.673
Who is it?
- Nobody. Forget it..

39:22.674 --> 39:26.678
Tell us, is he someone from school?
How old is he, what's he do?

39:26.679 --> 39:28.097
I'm not telling you anything..

39:28.098 --> 39:30.699
You have to tell us something!
- No, I really don't.

39:30.791 --> 39:35.472
Are you in love, Ivy?
- I...I don't...I'm...

39:55.671 --> 39:58.545
No, we maintain the accounts offshore,
just until we get approvals.

39:58.546 --> 40:00.612
- What..to get around approvals?

40:00.613 --> 40:03.912
To get around approvals
until we get approvals.

40:03.913 --> 40:07.632
There's a lot of bureaucracy, red tape..
I don't know how much you know about Florida,

40:07.633 --> 40:08.996
 Florida politics.

40:08.997 --> 40:12.944
Only what I read and that's..
- Right, right, this kind of business in particular.

40:15.261 --> 40:17.460
...Charlie?
- Picking up Little Charles.

40:23.543 --> 40:25.541
Give. Me. The wine.

40:37.349 --> 40:39.587
Is that what you were in such a
hurry to get home for?

40:41.315 --> 40:43.853
What the hell's on TV
that's so important you?

40:43.962 --> 40:46.579
<i>Phantom of the Opera,</i> 1925.

40:46.580 --> 40:48.758
They're showing it with the
scene in color restored.

40:49.437 --> 40:50.856
Cool.

40:51.095 --> 40:54.333
Let me make sure I've got this.
when you threw a fit..

40:54.562 --> 40:57.569
about going to the store with your dad...
Hey, look at me.

40:58.648 --> 41:03.491
And you were so distraught over the
start time of your Grandpa's funeral.

41:03.492 --> 41:04.690
Was this your concern? Huh?

41:04.691 --> 41:08.696
Getting back here in time to watch
Phantom of the Fucking Opera?

41:10.121 --> 41:11.996
I guess.

41:13.894 --> 41:16.266
Christ.

41:20.406 --> 41:21.933
Phantom of the Opera, huh?

41:21.934 --> 41:24.652
Huh-uh.
- Hi, doodle.

41:28.898 --> 41:30.586
Doodle.

41:31.944 --> 41:34.023
Hey, baby.

41:38.248 --> 41:40.297
I want to show you our old fort.

41:41.322 --> 41:45.062
Man, the air in here
just doesn't move.

41:45.411 --> 41:47.160
I'll hook you up, later.

42:06.360 --> 42:08.187
I'm sorry, Dad.

42:08.188 --> 42:11.246
No need to apologize.
- I know, Mom's mad at me.

42:11.395 --> 42:13.463
Don't worry about her.
- What did she say?

42:14.182 --> 42:16.882
Your mother,
she says what she says.

42:16.883 --> 42:18.237
I set the alarm. I did.

42:18.238 --> 42:21.735
I know you did.
- I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.

42:21.944 --> 42:23.623
Just stop, apologizing.

42:23.643 --> 42:25.272
I missed his funeral!

42:27.099 --> 42:28.608
Ah, its..

42:29.547 --> 42:31.374
It's a ceremony.

42:31.375 --> 42:33.443
It's ceremonial.

42:33.463 --> 42:36.360
It doesn't mean
anything compared to..

42:36.360 --> 42:38.179
what you have in your heart.

42:38.238 --> 42:40.167
Hold on,

42:40.206 --> 42:41.865
comb your hair.

42:48.158 --> 42:50.346
Uncle Bev, must be
disappointed in me.

42:51.455 --> 42:56.389
Your Uncle Bev has got bigger
and better things ahead of him.

42:56.390 --> 42:58.229
He doesn't have time for spite.

42:59.287 --> 43:01.315
He wasn't that kind of man, anyway.

43:11.115 --> 43:12.574
Hey,

43:15.631 --> 43:17.899
hey..It's okay.

43:26.653 --> 43:28.207
Just...

43:29.357 --> 43:31.276
I know how things are.
I know how  they..

43:31.495 --> 43:33.623
..think about me;

43:34.122 --> 43:36.410
and something like this...
you want to be there for people,

43:36.680 --> 43:39.997
I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.
- Hey, You haven't let me down.

43:41.615 --> 43:43.613
You never let me down.

43:43.733 --> 43:45.461
Now listen...

43:46.650 --> 43:49.297
you're wrong about these
people, they love you.

43:49.677 --> 43:51.504
They love you.

43:51.505 --> 43:53.313
Some of them,

43:53.373 --> 43:56.800
haven't gotten a chance to see
what I see.

43:58.138 --> 44:00.316
A fine man,

44:01.095 --> 44:03.012
very loving,

44:03.013 --> 44:06.221
..a with a lot to offer.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.504
Now take this

44:15.001 --> 44:18.698
Give me my comb.

44:28.797 --> 44:30.496
I love you, Dad.

44:32.644 --> 44:35.727
Love you too, son.

44:40.166 --> 44:41.903
Phantom of the Opera?

44:41.904 --> 44:43.741
You don't remember
what it was like to be fourteen?

44:43.742 --> 44:47.024
She's old enough to exhibit
a little character.

44:47.194 --> 44:49.857
But, that's something you normally
learn from your parents.

44:49.858 --> 44:52.500
That's a shot across my bow, right?
I missed something.

44:52.501 --> 44:54.113
Really? Instilling character.

44:54.482 --> 44:56.758
Our burden as parents.
- I got that part.

44:56.759 --> 44:58.850
And you really haven't
been much of a parent lately,

44:58.851 --> 45:00.049
..so it's tough to..
- Just because you and I are..

45:00.050 --> 45:03.245
..struggling with this Gordian knot
It doesn't mean..

45:03.246 --> 45:06.019
..but her fourteen-year-old
self might view it differently.

45:06.020 --> 45:07.859
might consider it "abandonment"

45:07.918 --> 45:11.215
Oh, come on, she's a little more sophisticated
than that, don't you think?

45:11.215 --> 45:12.529
Pretty fucking sophisticated,

45:12.530 --> 45:16.424
the restored whatever from Phantom of the
Opera, I know that makes your dick hard..

45:16.839 --> 45:17.965
Barbara --
- Precocious little shit.

45:17.966 --> 45:20.618
I'm not defending her.
- I am not blaming her.

45:21.834 --> 45:24.392
I'm on your side.
- ..selfish son of a bitch!

45:24.393 --> 45:28.101
Be a father! Help me!
- I am her father, goddamn it!

45:28.102 --> 45:31.370
Her father in name only!
- I have not forsook my responsibilities!

45:31.371 --> 45:32.569
It's "forsaken," big shot!

45:32.570 --> 45:34.948
Actually, "forsook" is also an
acceptable usage.

45:34.949 --> 45:37.219
Oh, "forsook" you and the horse
you rode in on.

45:38.158 --> 45:40.075
You don't fight fair.

45:40.076 --> 45:42.045
I've seen where that gets me!

45:42.753 --> 45:46.274
GROW UP! while you're dyeing your hair
and going through your fifth puberty,

45:46.275 --> 45:48.922
the world is falling apart and
your kid can't handle it!

45:49.007 --> 45:51.799
Our kid is just trying to deal with this
goddamn madhouse you've dragged her into.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.998
This madhouse is my home.

45:52.999 --> 45:55.324
Think about that statement
for a second, why don't you?

45:55.325 --> 45:56.523
Jean is here with me because..

45:56.524 --> 45:59.108
..this is a family event.
- Jean's here with you because she's a buffer..

45:59.109 --> 46:01.948
between you and the shrill insanity
of your mother.

46:01.949 --> 46:04.190
Y'know, you'd have a lot more
credibility if you had any credibility.

46:04.191 --> 46:05.389
You're a easy mark.
- You're so goddamn self-righteous,

46:05.390 --> 46:07.814
..you know that? You're so..
- Surely you must've realised..

46:07.815 --> 46:11.395
when you started porking Pippi Longstocking
you were due for a little self-righteousness,

46:11.396 --> 46:15.588
..just a smidge of indignation on my part.
- Maybe, I split because of it!

46:16.398 --> 46:18.527
Is this your confession, then,

46:18.528 --> 46:20.116
when you finally, unload all? Hmm?

46:21.944 --> 46:24.023
You're thoughtful, Barbara,
but you're not open.

46:24.751 --> 46:26.370
You're passionate, but you're hard.

46:27.039 --> 46:30.355
You're a good, decent, funny,
wonderful woman, and I love you, but..

46:30.356 --> 46:32.404
You're a pain in the ass!

47:13.872 --> 47:15.985
One for me.

47:17.588 --> 47:19.237
One for the girls.

47:39.187 --> 47:40.636
Mom's casserole.

47:40.955 --> 47:42.634
They said you overslept.

47:45.311 --> 47:47.707
Maybe I purposely accidentally overslept.
I don't know.

47:47.708 --> 47:50.249
I'm so sorry.
- Please.

47:50.366 --> 47:51.835
I know you had one of the worst
days of your life and..

47:52.723 --> 47:56.950
I'm sorry that I wasn't there.
- We don't have to do that with each other.

47:59.616 --> 48:00.986
You're breaking our rule.

48:04.362 --> 48:06.420
They're on to me.
Not us, just me.

48:07.269 --> 48:09.177
I told them I was seeing someone.

48:09.656 --> 48:11.274
I didn't tell them who.
I just wanted you to know,

48:11.275 --> 48:14.169
in case it came up.

48:16.706 --> 48:18.556
What?

48:22.136 --> 48:24.024
Charles...

48:24.025 --> 48:25.571
I adore you.

48:30.366 --> 48:33.222
Pass the casserole, please?

48:33.223 --> 48:34.231
My casserole's coming.

48:34.232 --> 48:36.419
I'll eat some of yours, too.

48:36.420 --> 48:38.108
Mom?! Let's eat!

48:39.037 --> 48:41.125
Oh, There he is.

48:41.335 --> 48:44.328
I wanted to put you at a kid's
table but they wouldn't let me.

48:44.329 --> 48:46.120
Where do you want me to put this?

48:46.300 --> 48:49.857
Hi, Little Charles.
I want you to meet my fiance Steve.

48:52.548 --> 48:54.966
Goddamn it --! O-pah!

48:55.780 --> 48:57.529
You goddamn clumsy goofball!

48:57.568 --> 48:59.457
Mom, I'm so sorry.
- All right, nobody's hurt.

48:59.626 --> 49:03.896
What about me? I'm hurt.
- It's not a party, until somebody spills something.

49:03.897 --> 49:05.396
That's my casserole!

49:05.610 --> 49:08.148
Let it go, Mattie Fae.
- I'm so sorry.

49:08.178 --> 49:09.721
Who wants chicken?

49:09.722 --> 49:12.383
Jean, you didn't get any chicken.

49:12.384 --> 49:13.581
I don't eat meat.

49:13.582 --> 49:15.081
You don't eat meat.

49:16.479 --> 49:18.648
Okay.
Mom!

49:19.486 --> 49:23.380
Just put it on his plate for him or
he's liable to burn the house down.

49:23.381 --> 49:26.068
All right, Mattie Fae.

49:26.589 --> 49:28.128
Barbara...

49:32.913 --> 49:34.562
..will you put this?

49:34.921 --> 49:36.750
Over there.
- Yeah, sure.

49:38.717 --> 49:41.815
MATTIE FAE: That's so nice.
KAREN: So, sweet.

49:42.443 --> 49:46.144
I see you gentlemen have all stripped
down to your shirt fronts.

49:46.145 --> 49:47.948
I thought we were having a
funeral dinner,

49:49.616 --> 49:51.485
not a cockfight.

50:10.955 --> 50:12.874
Someone should probably say grace.

50:15.880 --> 50:17.379
Barbara?

50:21.153 --> 50:24.052
Uncle Charlie should say it.
He's the..

50:24.252 --> 50:26.340
patriarch around here now.

50:26.469 --> 50:29.197
I am?
- By default.

50:33.522 --> 50:35.261
Okay.

50:38.607 --> 50:40.426
<i>Dear Lord...</i>

50:41.265 --> 50:42.943
<i>We ask that you..</i>

50:43.992 --> 50:45.561
<i>watch over this family..</i>

50:46.160 --> 50:48.488
<i>in this sad time, O Lord...</i>

50:49.077 --> 50:50.816
<i>that you..</i>

50:51.634 --> 50:53.401
<i>bless this good woman and..</i>

50:53.402 --> 50:56.300
<i>keep her in your..
in your...</i>

50:57.788 --> 50:59.217
<i>..grace.</i>

51:14.381 --> 51:17.238
I gotta to take this.

51:17.239 --> 51:19.637
Work..it's very important.

51:20.196 --> 51:21.775
...in Oklahoma. Yeah..

51:28.128 --> 51:30.096
<i>We ask that you watch over..</i>

51:30.246 --> 51:32.004
<i>Beverly, too, as he...</i>

51:34.012 --> 51:35.810
<i>as he...</i>

51:37.638 --> 51:39.737
<i>as he makes his journey.</i>

51:41.934 --> 51:45.621
<i>We thank thee, O Lord,
that we are able to join together,</i>

51:46.869 --> 51:49.277
<i>to pay tribute to this fine man.</i>

51:50.415 --> 51:52.654
<i>in his house, with his..</i>

51:53.322 --> 51:55.331
<i>beautiful daughters.</i>

51:56.579 --> 52:00.706
<i>We are truly blessed
in our fellowship,</i>

52:01.754 --> 52:03.413
<i>our togetherness,
our... our..</i>

52:06.549 --> 52:08.088
<i>fellowship.</i>

52:09.326 --> 52:13.753
<i>We thank thee for the food,
O Lord, that we can..</i>

52:13.842 --> 52:16.889
<i>share this food...</i>

52:18.397 --> 52:20.664
<i>and replenish our bodies with...</i>

52:20.665 --> 52:22.254
<i>nutrients.</i>

52:23.342 --> 52:25.441
<i>We ask that you help us..</i>

52:25.470 --> 52:27.088
<i>get better.</i>

52:27.089 --> 52:28.718
<i>Be better people.</i>

52:30.275 --> 52:34.562
<i>We recognize now more than ever
the power, the...</i>

52:35.161 --> 52:37.249
<i>joy of family.</i>

52:37.728 --> 52:43.637
<i>We ask that you bless and watch
over this family. Amen.</i>

52:44.483 --> 52:47.582
Amen. So, sorry folks.
- Let's eat.

52:52.603 --> 52:55.950
Barb, you have any use
for that sideboard?

52:56.689 --> 52:58.228
That sideboard there,

52:58.477 --> 53:00.205
you have any interest in that?

53:00.206 --> 53:01.651
It's so pretty.

53:01.652 --> 53:04.256
No. I mean, why?

53:04.257 --> 53:08.410
I'm getting rid of a lot of this stuff and
I thought you might want that sideboard.

53:09.796 --> 53:12.044
No, Mom, I...I wouldn't have any
way to get that home to Colorado.

53:12.213 --> 53:13.732
Maybe, Ivy'll take it.

53:14.571 --> 53:17.329
I have something like that, remember.
- Clearing all this out of here.

53:17.388 --> 53:19.495
It's really pretty.
- I want to have a brand new everything.

53:19.496 --> 53:23.997
I guess I'm just sort of... not
prepared to talk about your stuff.

53:25.801 --> 53:27.636
Suit yourself.

53:30.315 --> 53:33.312
The food is just spectacular.

53:35.310 --> 53:37.807
Johnna cooked this
whole meal by herself.

53:37.808 --> 53:42.064
It's what she's paid for.
Y'all did know she's getting paid, right?

53:43.172 --> 53:44.701
Jean,

53:45.520 --> 53:47.688
so..I'm curious,

53:47.878 --> 53:52.602
when you say you don't eat meat,
you mean, you don't eat meat of any kind?

53:52.603 --> 53:54.102
Right.

53:55.770 --> 53:58.128
Is that for health reasons, or...?

53:58.317 --> 54:01.245
When you eat meat,
you ingest an animal's fear.

54:01.246 --> 54:02.444
Ingest what?

54:02.445 --> 54:04.960
It's fur?
- Fear.

54:07.489 --> 54:09.255
I thought she said --

54:11.159 --> 54:13.614
How do you do that?
You can't eat fear.

54:13.615 --> 54:14.750
Sure you can. I mean..

54:14.751 --> 54:16.340
What happens to you,
when you feel afraid?

54:16.589 --> 54:19.316
Doesn't your body produce
all sorts of chemical reactions?

54:19.317 --> 54:20.515
I don't know..
Does it?

54:20.516 --> 54:21.714
It does.
- Yes.

54:21.715 --> 54:22.913
Adrenaline, and, and --

54:22.914 --> 54:26.441
Your body goes through a whole chemical
process when it experiences fear.

54:26.442 --> 54:29.217
..and cortisol.
- Don't you think an animal experiences fear?

54:29.218 --> 54:30.664
You bet it does.

54:30.665 --> 54:33.093
I used to work at a
cattle processing plant,

54:33.772 --> 54:35.724
lots of fear flying
around that place.

54:35.725 --> 54:36.923
So, when you eat an meat,

54:36.924 --> 54:42.092
you're ingesting all that fear it felt
when it was slaughtered to make food.

54:43.422 --> 54:45.381
You mean I've been
eating fear, what,

54:45.410 --> 54:47.029
 three times a day for..

54:47.069 --> 54:49.896
..sixty years?

54:50.195 --> 54:52.692
This one won't have a meal

54:52.693 --> 54:57.109
that doesn't meat in it.
- I guess it's the way I was raised,

54:57.768 --> 55:03.253
but, somehow it just doesn't seem like a
legitimate meal less it has some meat somewhere.

55:03.392 --> 55:05.889
If I make a pasta dish of
some kind, he'll be like,

55:05.890 --> 55:08.386
<i> "That's fine for an appetizer,
but where's the meat?"</i>

55:08.387 --> 55:10.884
Isn't that some TV commercial,

55:10.885 --> 55:14.212
the old lady says,
"Where's the meat?"

55:14.231 --> 55:15.670
"Where's the beef?"

55:17.718 --> 55:19.843
"Where's the meat?!"
"Where's the meat?!"

55:19.844 --> 55:22.924
"Where's the meat?!"
"Hey, Where's the meat?!"

55:23.312 --> 55:24.781
That's pleasant.

55:27.128 --> 55:29.854
I thought,
the services were lovely.

55:29.855 --> 55:32.330
Yes, weren't they?
- Preacher did a fine job.

55:34.571 --> 55:38.631
I give it a...Ehhhhh!
- Really? you thought so?

55:38.632 --> 55:40.627
Great, now we get some
dramatic criticism.

55:40.628 --> 55:44.040
Too much talk about
poetry and teaching.

55:44.061 --> 55:45.800
He hadn't written any poetry,

55:45.820 --> 55:47.359
to speak of since ‘65

55:47.848 --> 55:51.674
He never liked teaching worth a damn.
Nobody talked about the good stuff.

55:51.914 --> 55:55.640
Man was a world-class alcoholic,
more'n fifty years.

55:56.030 --> 56:01.135
Nobody told the story about that night he got
wrangled into giving a talk at that TU alumni dinner...

56:02.423 --> 56:06.818
Drank a whole bottle of
Ron Bocoy White Rum,

56:06.819 --> 56:08.478
don't know why I remember that,

56:08.667 --> 56:10.765
and got up to give this talk,

56:11.054 --> 56:12.713
and he fouled himself!

56:14.541 --> 56:20.254
Comes back to our table with this great..
- Yeah, I can't imagine why no one told that story.

56:20.255 --> 56:23.922
Well, he didn't get invited back to
anymore TU alumni dinners.

56:23.923 --> 56:25.422
I can tell you that.

56:27.528 --> 56:30.844
I don't know much
about poetry, but..

56:30.845 --> 56:33.013
I thought his poems
were extraordinary.

56:33.602 --> 56:34.890
And your reading was very fine.

56:34.891 --> 56:37.309
Thank you.

56:37.878 --> 56:39.467
Who are you?

56:41.784 --> 56:44.482
This is my fiance, Steve,
you met him at the church.

56:44.661 --> 56:46.268
Steve Heidebrecht.

56:46.269 --> 56:49.017
Hide-the-what?
- Heidebrecht.

56:50.345 --> 56:54.861
Hide-a-burrr...It's German.
- Well, German-Irish, really..

56:55.710 --> 56:58.058
That's peculiar, Karen,

56:58.317 --> 57:00.725
to bring a date to
your father's funeral.

57:00.815 --> 57:04.810
I know the poetry was good, but I really
wouldn't have considered it date material.

57:04.811 --> 57:07.781
He's not a date, he's my fiance.

57:07.782 --> 57:10.824
We're getting married on New Years, in Miami,

57:10.825 --> 57:13.203
And, I would love it,
if you can make it.

57:13.702 --> 57:15.810
I don't really see that
happening, do you?

57:16.179 --> 57:17.628
Steve.

57:18.007 --> 57:20.136
That right? Steve?

57:20.355 --> 57:22.004
Yes, ma'am.

57:22.952 --> 57:24.621
You ever been married before?

57:25.130 --> 57:26.959
Yes, ma'am, I have.

57:27.138 --> 57:29.575
More then once?

57:29.576 --> 57:31.774
Three times, actually,
three times before this.

57:33.192 --> 57:35.580
You should pretty much
have it down by now, then.

57:36.189 --> 57:38.288
Right,
right..

57:40.685 --> 57:42.692
I had that one pegged. Didn't I?

57:42.693 --> 57:46.519
I mean, look at him,
you can tell he's been married.

57:46.562 --> 57:51.115
I went outside to show Steve the old fort
and it's torn down!

57:51.116 --> 57:53.689
That's been gone for years.
- I was so sad!

57:53.690 --> 57:55.909
What is this now?
- Our old fort, where we used to play..

57:55.910 --> 57:58.876
Cowboys and Indians.
- Daddy said rats were getting in there.

57:58.877 --> 58:00.376
Karen! Shame on you!

58:02.972 --> 58:05.101
Don't you know not to say
Cowboys and Indians?

58:05.510 --> 58:09.916
You played Cowboys and
Native Americans,

58:10.375 --> 58:12.094
right Barb?

58:12.213 --> 58:14.650
What are you taking?
What pills?

58:14.651 --> 58:17.935
Oh, Leave me alone.

58:19.366 --> 58:20.745
Uh-oh!

58:21.194 --> 58:22.743
What is it?

58:23.652 --> 58:25.261
What is it?

58:27.268 --> 58:29.127
What's the matter?
- You okay, Uncle Charles.

58:29.156 --> 58:33.772
UH-OH!
I got a big bite of fear!

58:37.568 --> 58:39.706
Fear never tasted so good.

58:41.993 --> 58:45.539
It's pretty good once
you get used to the taste.

58:45.540 --> 58:47.468
I'm shakin' in my boots!

58:51.694 --> 58:54.931
I do catch her eating a cheeseburger
every now and again.

58:54.990 --> 58:58.406
No, you don't!
- Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra fear.

58:58.407 --> 58:59.605
Mom, you are such a liar!

58:59.606 --> 59:01.105
No stop. You are!

59:01.494 --> 59:04.128
Y'know, if I ever called
my mother a liar?

59:04.129 --> 59:08.725
She would've knocked my goddamn
head off my shoulders.

59:16.549 --> 59:18.855
You girls know there's a will.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.114
Mom...

59:20.115 --> 59:22.523
We took care of it some time back.

59:23.112 --> 59:24.483
We don't want to talk about it.

59:24.484 --> 59:28.126
I want to talk about it.
What about what I want to talk about?

59:28.127 --> 59:29.706
Does that count for anything?

59:31.104 --> 59:34.175
Bev made some good investments,
believe it or not,

59:34.176 --> 59:37.658
We had money for you girls
in his will, but..

59:38.926 --> 59:42.692
we talked it over
after some times passed

59:42.693 --> 59:47.166
and decided to change things,
leave everything to me.

59:47.167 --> 59:51.647
We didn't get around to
taking care of it legally, but..

59:52.343 --> 59:55.370
you should know he meant
to leave the money to me.

59:59.863 --> 01:00:01.625
Okay.

01:00:03.928 --> 01:00:05.555
Okay.

01:00:05.556 --> 01:00:07.055
Okay?

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:10.601
Okay.
Karen, Okay?

01:00:10.602 --> 01:00:12.963
Yeah, Okay.
- Okay.

01:00:12.964 --> 01:00:16.377
But now some of this furniture,
some of this old shit you can just have.

01:00:16.808 --> 01:00:18.677
I don't want it, got no use for it.

01:00:18.966 --> 01:00:20.555
Maybe, I should have an auction.

01:00:21.024 --> 01:00:25.420
Sure, an auction's a fine idea.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:29.346
Some things, though, like the silver,
that's worth a pretty penny.

01:00:29.396 --> 01:00:31.494
But, if you like I'll sell
it to you, If you like.

01:00:31.564 --> 01:00:33.582
For cheaper'n I might
get in an auction.

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.549
Or you might never
get around to the auction,

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.644
and then we can just have it
for free after you die.

01:00:38.645 --> 01:00:40.144
Barbara...

01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:44.192
You might at that.

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:46.829
Bill? I was wondering,
You reading those poems..

01:00:49.126 --> 01:00:50.765
Which ones did you..

01:00:51.174 --> 01:00:54.329
..choose in the end to read?
- Well I..

01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:56.995
Bill, Where are you living now?

01:00:57.188 --> 01:00:58.827
You want this old sideboard?

01:01:00.695 --> 01:01:03.562
I beg your pardon.
- You and Barbara are separated, right?

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.408
Or, are you divorced already?

01:01:09.346 --> 01:01:12.393
No, we're separated.

01:01:12.932 --> 01:01:15.700
You thought you could slip that
by me, didn't you?

01:01:17.568 --> 01:01:20.036
Nobody slips anything by me.

01:01:21.164 --> 01:01:22.883
I know what's what.

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:27.477
Your father thought he's slipping
one by me too, right?

01:01:27.478 --> 01:01:30.415
What is the matter with you?
- I'm sorry you two're having trouble,

01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:32.184
maybe you can work it out.

01:01:32.762 --> 01:01:35.680
Bev'n I separated a few times,

01:01:36.239 --> 01:01:38.865
course we didn't call it that.

01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:41.284
Help us, with an illustration
from your storybook marriage.

01:01:41.923 --> 01:01:45.798
Truth is, you just can't compete
with a younger woman.

01:01:45.799 --> 01:01:49.514
It's just one of those unfair
things in life.

01:01:50.395 --> 01:01:53.732
Is there a younger woman involved?
- You've said enough on this topic.

01:01:53.991 --> 01:01:56.110
Yes. There's a younger woman.
- Well, Y'see?

01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:58.227
Odds're against you there, babe.

01:02:02.503 --> 01:02:04.411
Mom believes women don't grow
more attractive with age.

01:02:05.999 --> 01:02:08.597
Oh, I disagree, I..
- No..

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:10.444
I didn't say they
"don't grow more attractive,"

01:02:10.445 --> 01:02:13.101
I said they get ugly.

01:02:13.102 --> 01:02:15.350
And it's not really a matter
of opinion, Karen dear.

01:02:15.351 --> 01:02:18.428
You've only just started
to prove it yourself.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.954
You're in rare form today, Vi.

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.752
Well, The day calls for it,
doesn't it?

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:26.889
What form would you have me in?

01:02:27.238 --> 01:02:28.466
Hmm?

01:02:28.467 --> 01:02:31.324
I just don't understand
why you're so adversarial.

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:33.552
I'm just truth-telling.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:36.699
Some people are
antagonized by the truth.

01:02:37.258 --> 01:02:39.127
Everyone here loves you, dear.

01:02:39.695 --> 01:02:41.383
You think you can
shame me, Charlie?

01:02:41.384 --> 01:02:43.322
Blow it out your ass!

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:48.207
Three days ago...
I had to identified my father's corpse.

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:51.724
Now I'm supposed to sit here and
listen to you viciously attack,

01:02:51.873 --> 01:02:54.621
every member of this family.
- Attack my family?!

01:02:55.140 --> 01:02:56.927
Have you ever been attacked..

01:02:56.928 --> 01:02:58.206
in your sweet spoiled life?!

01:02:58.207 --> 01:03:00.903
Tell her 'bout attacks, Mattie Fae.

01:03:00.904 --> 01:03:03.336
Tell her what an attack looks like!
- Settle down, Mom.

01:03:03.337 --> 01:03:05.274
Don't tell me to settle
down, goddam it!

01:03:05.275 --> 01:03:09.075
I'm not a goddamn invalid!
Am I to be abided now.

01:03:09.076 --> 01:03:10.635
Have I been passed over?!

01:03:11.753 --> 01:03:13.622
C'mon, Honey..
- This woman..

01:03:14.241 --> 01:03:17.968
came to my rescue when
one of my dear mother's many..

01:03:18.307 --> 01:03:22.112
gentlemen friends was attacking me,
with a claw hammer!

01:03:22.113 --> 01:03:23.900
This woman has..

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:28.028
dents in her skull,
fro hammer blows.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.023
What do you know about

01:03:31.024 --> 01:03:33.662
..life on these Plains?
What do you know..

01:03:33.861 --> 01:03:35.610
..about hard times?

01:03:35.949 --> 01:03:38.143
We know you had a
rotten childhood, Mom.

01:03:38.144 --> 01:03:41.309
Who didn't?
- You DON'T know! You do NOT know!

01:03:41.773 --> 01:03:44.247
None of you know,
'cept this woman right here.

01:03:44.248 --> 01:03:47.087
And that man we buried today!

01:03:51.094 --> 01:03:53.043
Sweet girl, sweet Barbara,

01:03:54.171 --> 01:03:56.139
my heart breaks for every time,

01:03:56.289 --> 01:04:00.120
you ever felt pain.
I wish I coulda shielded you from it.

01:04:00.121 --> 01:04:01.303
But if you think,

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:03.800
you can fathom
for one solitary second..

01:04:03.801 --> 01:04:06.902
the pain that man endured
in his natural life,

01:04:06.903 --> 01:04:09.684
you got another think coming.

01:04:09.685 --> 01:04:13.352
Do you know where your father lived
from age four till about ten?

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:14.861
Do you?

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:16.897
Do you?

01:04:16.898 --> 01:04:18.397
No.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.785
In a Pontiac Sedan.

01:04:21.753 --> 01:04:25.110
With his mother, his father,
in a fucking car!

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.610
Six fucking years in a car!

01:04:27.577 --> 01:04:30.743
Now, what do you want to say about
your rotten childhood?

01:04:30.744 --> 01:04:31.942
Jesus.

01:04:31.943 --> 01:04:33.141
That's the crux of the biscuit.

01:04:33.142 --> 01:04:34.641
We lived too hard..

01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.961
and then rose too high.
We sacrificed everything!

01:04:37.962 --> 01:04:39.160
We did it all for you.

01:04:39.161 --> 01:04:44.010
Your father and I were the first in
our families to graduate high school.

01:04:44.011 --> 01:04:46.759
And he wound up,
an award-winning poet.

01:04:47.478 --> 01:04:49.476
You girls, just..

01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:51.514
given a college education,

01:04:51.823 --> 01:04:54.879
taken for granted, no doubt.
Where did you wind up?

01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.659
What did you do?

01:04:56.918 --> 01:04:58.807
What did <i>you</i> do?

01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:02.292
Who are you?

01:05:02.293 --> 01:05:03.540
Jesus!

01:05:03.541 --> 01:05:06.139
Jesus, you worked as hard as us,
you'd all be President.

01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:07.923
You never had real problems.

01:05:07.924 --> 01:05:10.171
So, you got to make all
your problems yourselves.

01:05:10.172 --> 01:05:11.671
Why are you screaming at us?

01:05:12.333 --> 01:05:14.271
Just time we had some truth's
told 'round here.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.188
Damn fine day,
to tell the truth.

01:05:19.396 --> 01:05:21.674
Well, the truth is...

01:05:22.023 --> 01:05:25.390
I'm getting full.
- Amen.

01:05:25.799 --> 01:05:27.558
There's dessert, too.

01:05:27.947 --> 01:05:31.053
She baked pies.
They look so lovely.

01:05:31.054 --> 01:05:32.392
I got a truth to tell.

01:05:32.393 --> 01:05:34.091
It speaks.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.309
What is it, son?

01:05:42.323 --> 01:05:44.881
I have a truth.
- Little Charles...?

01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:48.862
I..
- Charles, not like this, please...

01:05:52.183 --> 01:05:53.961
The truth is...

01:05:58.077 --> 01:05:59.746
I forgot to set the clock.

01:06:01.154 --> 01:06:04.078
The power didn't go out,
I I...forgot to set the clock.

01:06:04.079 --> 01:06:05.578
Sorry, Mom.

01:06:07.358 --> 01:06:09.126
I'm sorry, everyone.

01:06:09.435 --> 01:06:11.993
Excuse me...I...just..

01:06:18.127 --> 01:06:19.734
Scintillating.

01:06:19.735 --> 01:06:21.534
I gave up a long time ago...

01:06:21.923 --> 01:06:24.101
Little Charles is your project now.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.429
Charles.

01:06:26.488 --> 01:06:28.407
His name is Charles.

01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:31.464
Poor Ivy.

01:06:31.683 --> 01:06:34.761
Poor baby.
- Please, Mom...

01:06:35.879 --> 01:06:38.696
She's always had a feeling
for the underdog.

01:06:38.697 --> 01:06:41.627
Don't be mean to me right now, okay?
- I am not..

01:06:41.853 --> 01:06:43.224
Everyone's got this idea..

01:06:43.225 --> 01:06:46.553
I'm mean all of a sudden.
- Please, momma.

01:06:46.554 --> 01:06:48.926
I'm just telling the truth.
- You're a drug addict.

01:06:49.695 --> 01:06:51.953
That is the truth!
That's what I'm getting at!

01:06:51.993 --> 01:06:53.960
Hey, everybody.
Everybody listen...

01:06:53.961 --> 01:06:55.909
I am a drug addict.

01:06:56.369 --> 01:06:57.946
I love drugs.

01:06:57.947 --> 01:07:00.165
Specially, pills,
specially downers.

01:07:00.484 --> 01:07:02.573
Y'see these little blue babies?

01:07:02.722 --> 01:07:04.791
These are my best fucking friends,

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.807
..and they never
let me down.

01:07:08.017 --> 01:07:10.005
Try to get ‘em away from me;

01:07:10.095 --> 01:07:12.023
I'll eat you alive.

01:07:12.103 --> 01:07:16.315
Gimme those goddamn pills..
- I'll eat you alive, girl!

01:07:18.423 --> 01:07:20.426
Holy shit!

01:07:26.355 --> 01:07:28.514
Barbara, stop it.

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:38.197
Hey, now, c'mon!

01:07:38.207 --> 01:07:39.915
Give that to me!

01:07:41.214 --> 01:07:44.960
Goddamn you...

01:07:45.619 --> 01:07:47.847
goddamn you..

01:07:50.125 --> 01:07:53.350
Sit down.
- Okay. Pill raid.

01:07:53.351 --> 01:07:55.720
Remember this?
Remember how it goes?

01:07:56.568 --> 01:07:59.136
Search everything!
Every closet...

01:07:59.156 --> 01:08:02.646
Every drawer, every shoebox.

01:08:03.282 --> 01:08:05.350
Karen, call Dr. Burke.

01:08:06.528 --> 01:08:08.797
You can't do this!
This is my house!

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.304
This is my house!

01:08:12.283 --> 01:08:13.931
You don't get it, do you?

01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:16.129
You don't get it.

01:08:16.948 --> 01:08:18.805
I'M RUNNING THINGS NOW!

01:08:26.997 --> 01:08:29.626
Why'd Dr. Burke write her so many
prescriptions?

01:08:29.685 --> 01:08:31.082
Didn't he know?

01:08:31.084 --> 01:08:34.939
It's not just him.
She's got a doctor in every port.

01:08:35.255 --> 01:08:37.058
And you knew,
 this was going on again?

01:08:57.947 --> 01:08:59.506
I'm sorry about you and Bill.

01:08:59.984 --> 01:09:01.484
Me too, Barb.

01:09:03.002 --> 01:09:05.529
You think, it's temporary or..

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:09.448
Who knows?

01:09:09.814 --> 01:09:11.474
We've been married a long time.

01:09:17.058 --> 01:09:18.527
Now what?

01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:25.783
DR. BURKE: The chemotherapy and radiation,

01:09:25.785 --> 01:09:27.165
coupled with the overuse of..

01:09:27.166 --> 01:09:28.962
pain medications.
- Right..

01:09:28.964 --> 01:09:31.296
and without the benefit of more
thorough testing,

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:32.796
an MRI or CT scan,

01:09:34.723 --> 01:09:37.991
I believe your mother is suffering
from Mild Cognitive Impairment.

01:09:37.992 --> 01:09:39.189
- Mild Cognitive Impairment?

01:09:39.191 --> 01:09:40.689
Brain damage.

01:09:41.603 --> 01:09:45.645
It may be time to consider placing
her in a long term care facility.

01:09:45.645 --> 01:09:50.090
I know i'd feel more comfortable If I know,
she was receiving that level of supervision.

01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:51.287
And, where would you
have us put her?

01:09:51.288 --> 01:09:53.600
A psychiatric hospital?

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.020
Well, Beverly's gone.

01:09:55.309 --> 01:09:58.137
Well, not so much as "gone"
as "dead," but I see your point.

01:09:58.336 --> 01:10:02.142
Legal guardianship, for you and your
sisters, with my recommendation..

01:10:02.143 --> 01:10:05.675
So you're thinking, if the three of us
cooperated with this,

01:10:05.999 --> 01:10:10.515
commitment end-around,
we'd be less likely to sue your ass?

01:10:11.533 --> 01:10:13.830
I'm sorry?
- "Mild Cognitive Impairment?"

01:10:13.831 --> 01:10:15.330
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:10:16.159 --> 01:10:18.217
All right?

01:10:18.306 --> 01:10:19.935
Know whose name is
on these bottles?

01:10:20.005 --> 01:10:22.904
Do you?
- Your mother's a very sick person.

01:10:22.905 --> 01:10:25.695
We've a whole bucket of these
with your name on it.

01:10:25.696 --> 01:10:27.195
Evidence for the medical board.

01:10:31.786 --> 01:10:34.371
Let's go.
I thing we're done.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:50.378
Pull the car over.

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.878
We'll be home in a minute.

01:10:52.642 --> 01:10:54.735
Pull the car over.

01:10:54.740 --> 01:10:57.917
I'm going to be sick.

01:11:36.067 --> 01:11:38.484
Mom. Mom?

01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:43.459
Mom?!

01:12:06.488 --> 01:12:08.622
Mom!

01:12:08.623 --> 01:12:11.499
Mom!

01:12:11.603 --> 01:12:14.599
Mom! Wait!

01:12:22.284 --> 01:12:24.236
Mom!

01:12:29.075 --> 01:12:30.730
What are you doing?

01:12:30.731 --> 01:12:33.620
Where the fuck are you going?

01:12:39.619 --> 01:12:42.709
There's no place to go.

01:12:51.173 --> 01:12:52.852
I'm sorry.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.928
Honey, please?
- No, it's important I say this.

01:13:00.064 --> 01:13:02.123
I lost my temper at dinner
and went too far.

01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:04.461
Barbara.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.918
The day, the funeral...

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.775
the pills. I was..

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.472
spoiling for a fight and you
gave it to me.

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:20.569
So... truce?

01:13:22.772 --> 01:13:24.920
Truce.
Yeah, sure.

01:13:26.088 --> 01:13:27.907
Now, what?

01:13:30.674 --> 01:13:32.223
How do you mean?

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.767
Don't you think you should consider
going back to a rehab center?

01:13:39.135 --> 01:13:41.513
I can't go through that again.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:43.462
I can do this.

01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:45.589
You've..

01:13:45.959 --> 01:13:48.933
You took all my pills, right?

01:13:48.934 --> 01:13:50.345
All that we could find.
- Well...

01:13:50.346 --> 01:13:53.525
I don't have that many hiding places.
- Now..Mom, come on.

01:13:53.526 --> 01:13:55.727
You wanna search me?
- No.

01:14:02.082 --> 01:14:05.145
If the pills are gone,
I'll be fine.

01:14:05.146 --> 01:14:11.070
I just need a few days
to get my feet under me.

01:14:11.203 --> 01:14:14.121
I want you to know, you're not alone.
If you need any help.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.389
I don't need help.

01:14:16.498 --> 01:14:18.876
I wanna help.
- I don't need your help.

01:14:19.165 --> 01:14:20.832
Mom?
- I don't need your help.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:23.923
I've gotten myself..

01:14:32.582 --> 01:14:34.750
I know how this goes.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:36.738
Once all the talking's through,

01:14:36.947 --> 01:14:38.735
people go back to their own..

01:14:38.736 --> 01:14:40.383
...nonsense.

01:14:40.384 --> 01:14:42.063
I know that. So,

01:14:42.752 --> 01:14:46.349
Don't worry about me. I'll manage.
I get by.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:02.260
Remember when we checked her in the
psych ward, that stunt she pulled?

01:15:02.261 --> 01:15:03.450
Big speech..

01:15:03.451 --> 01:15:07.155
she's getting clean, making this
incredible sacrifice for her family,

01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:09.294
she's let us down but now
she'll prove she's a good mother.

01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:11.923
She smuggled Darvocet
into the psych ward..

01:15:12.052 --> 01:15:13.580
...in her vagina.

01:15:13.581 --> 01:15:16.501
There's your Greatest
Generation for you.

01:15:16.502 --> 01:15:18.001
She's giving this speech
to us while she was..

01:15:18.586 --> 01:15:20.794
..clenching a bottle of pills
in her cooch.

01:15:20.844 --> 01:15:23.476
I've never heard this story.

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:24.976
Did you just say "cooch"?

01:15:25.279 --> 01:15:27.038
The phrase "Mom's pussy"
seems gauche.

01:15:27.307 --> 01:15:29.244
You're a little more comfortable
with "cooch," are you?

01:15:29.245 --> 01:15:31.848
What word should I use to describe
our mother's vagina?

01:15:31.849 --> 01:15:34.369
I don't know, Barb.
- "Mom's beaver"?

01:15:34.859 --> 01:15:37.447
 "Mother's box"?
- Oh God, Barbara!

01:15:39.435 --> 01:15:41.762
One thing about Mom and Dad.

01:15:41.763 --> 01:15:47.856
You have to tip your cap to anybody
who can stay married that long.

01:15:47.857 --> 01:15:50.144
Karen. He killed himself.

01:15:50.704 --> 01:15:53.947
We don't know that, for sure.

01:15:56.162 --> 01:15:59.491
Is there something going on between
you and Little Charles?

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.784
I don't know that I'm comfortable
talking about that.

01:16:03.785 --> 01:16:06.235
Because, he's our first cousin. You know.
- Give me a break.

01:16:06.236 --> 01:16:08.766
You know you shouldn't
consider children.

01:16:09.495 --> 01:16:13.394
I can't anyway,
I had a hysterectomy last year.

01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:15.779
Why?
- Cervical cancer.

01:16:16.847 --> 01:16:19.423
I didn't know.
- Neither did I.

01:16:19.424 --> 01:16:20.923
I didn't tell anyone
except Charles.

01:16:21.053 --> 01:16:22.682
That's where it started between us.

01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:27.384
Why not?
- And hear it from Mom the rest of my life?

01:16:27.797 --> 01:16:30.514
She doesn't need another excuse to
treat me like some damaged thing.

01:16:30.983 --> 01:16:32.742
You might have told us.

01:16:33.591 --> 01:16:35.148
You didn't tell us about you and Bill.
- That's different.

01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:36.648
Why?

01:16:37.067 --> 01:16:39.784
Because it's you, and not me?

01:16:39.785 --> 01:16:44.034
Because divorce is an embarrassing
public admission of defeat.

01:16:44.035 --> 01:16:46.493
Cancer's fucking cancer,
you can't help that.

01:16:46.494 --> 01:16:48.358
We're your sisters.

01:16:49.904 --> 01:16:51.403
I don't feel that
connection very keenly.

01:16:51.433 --> 01:16:54.009
I feel very connected,
to both of you.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.498
We never see you,
you're never around,

01:16:57.087 --> 01:17:00.003
you haven't been around...
- I still feel that connection!

01:17:00.004 --> 01:17:03.375
I can't perpetuate these myths of family
or sisterhood anymore.

01:17:03.376 --> 01:17:05.877
We're just people, some of us
accidentally connected by genetics,

01:17:05.878 --> 01:17:08.365
a random selection of cells.

01:17:08.366 --> 01:17:11.733
When did you get so cynical?
- That's funny, coming from you.

01:17:12.622 --> 01:17:15.669
Well, Bitter, Yes, but
"random selection of cells?"

01:17:18.256 --> 01:17:21.648
Maybe my cynicism came with the
realization that the responsibility,

01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:24.452
of caring for our
parents was mine alone.

01:17:24.453 --> 01:17:26.292
Don't give me that. I participated.

01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:30.624
Till you had enough and got out,
you and Karen both. I'm not criticizing.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.748
Do what you want.
You did, Karen did.

01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:34.248
And if you didn't,
that's not my fault.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:36.998
That's right, so don't lay this sister
thing on me, all right?

01:17:37.677 --> 01:17:41.732
When I leave here I won't feel
any more guilty than you two did.

01:17:41.733 --> 01:17:44.970
I can't believe
your world view is this dark.

01:17:46.817 --> 01:17:48.776
You live in Florida.

01:17:50.743 --> 01:17:52.431
You're thinking of leaving?

01:17:52.432 --> 01:17:53.931
Yeah.

01:17:55.029 --> 01:17:57.906
Charles and I are
going to New York.

01:17:58.316 --> 01:17:59.935
What are you going
to do in New York?

01:18:00.034 --> 01:18:01.362
We have plans.

01:18:01.363 --> 01:18:04.101
Like what?
- None of your business.

01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:05.937
What about Mom?
- What about her?

01:18:05.938 --> 01:18:08.316
You feel comfortable leaving her here?
- Do you?

01:18:11.423 --> 01:18:13.072
You're going back to Miami, right?
- Yes. I can't stay.

01:18:16.857 --> 01:18:18.252
There you go, Barb.

01:18:18.253 --> 01:18:21.377
You want to know what we're doing about Mom?
Karen and I are leaving.

01:18:21.378 --> 01:18:25.657
You want to stay, that's your decision.
But nobody gets to point a finger at me.

01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:28.879
Nobody.

01:18:40.933 --> 01:18:43.251
My three girls,

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:45.959
all together.

01:18:48.396 --> 01:18:53.991
Hearing you just now
gave me a warm feeling.

01:18:56.078 --> 01:18:57.186
You had a bath?
- Yeah.

01:18:57.187 --> 01:19:00.053
You want something to eat?
Some coffee?

01:19:00.054 --> 01:19:02.692
I'm fine. Honey, thank you.

01:19:08.416 --> 01:19:14.159
I'll bet, this house must have heard
a lot of Weston girl secrets.

01:19:15.319 --> 01:19:19.068
I get embarrassed
just thinking about it.

01:19:20.144 --> 01:19:22.562
Oh... nothing to be
embarrassed about.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:26.673
Secret crushes, secret schemes.

01:19:26.717 --> 01:19:30.313
I can't imagine anything more
delicate, or bittersweet.

01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:35.241
Some part of you girls
I always identified with...

01:19:35.242 --> 01:19:37.929
no matter how old you get,

01:19:37.930 --> 01:19:44.022
a woman's hard-pressed to throw off
that part of herself.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.496
That smells so good.

01:19:48.635 --> 01:19:51.004
It's apple. You want some?

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.507
Sure, I do.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:03.914
Hey, did I ever tell you
the story of Raymond Qualls?

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:07.957
That's a Boy I had a crush on
when I was thirteen or so.

01:20:09.115 --> 01:20:11.143
Rough-looking boy,

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:16.626
beat-up jeans and messy hair.

01:20:16.627 --> 01:20:18.246
Terrible underbite.

01:20:18.326 --> 01:20:21.823
But he had these
beautiful cowboy boots,

01:20:22.332 --> 01:20:25.219
shiny chocolate leather.

01:20:25.888 --> 01:20:30.374
He was so proud of those boots,
you could tell, the way..

01:20:30.753 --> 01:20:36.168
he'd strut around, all arms and
elbows, puffed up and cocksure.

01:20:36.478 --> 01:20:46.095
I convinced myself that I needed to
get a girly pair of those boots;

01:20:48.316 --> 01:20:51.733
and I was sure if I did that
that he'd ask me to go steady.

01:20:52.532 --> 01:20:57.861
You know, He'd see me in those boots
and say "That's the gal for me."

01:20:58.885 --> 01:21:00.264
Oh, gosh!

01:21:05.848 --> 01:21:10.243
So, I found the boots
in a window downtown,

01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:15.369
And, I just went crazy!

01:21:15.968 --> 01:21:18.556
Praying for those boots,
I'm rehearsing the..

01:21:18.635 --> 01:21:23.964
conversation that I'd have with
Raymond when he saw me in my boots.

01:21:24.589 --> 01:21:29.084
Must've asked my momma a hundred
times if I could get those boots.

01:21:29.085 --> 01:21:31.093
" Vi, What do you
want for Christmas?"

01:21:31.123 --> 01:21:36.372
"Momma, I'll give all of it up just
to have those boots." Bargaining..

01:21:36.373 --> 01:21:43.803
So, She started laying little hints around
about box a package under the tree..

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:48.504
she had wrapped up,
about the size of a boot box,

01:21:48.505 --> 01:21:51.673
Real nice wrapping paper.

01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:55.028
"Now, Vi, don't you cheat

01:21:55.029 --> 01:21:58.496
 and don't you go in there
before Christmas morning."

01:21:59.435 --> 01:22:03.635
Little smile on her face.
Christmas morning, I was up like a shot, boy,

01:22:03.636 --> 01:22:07.257
 under the tree,
I was tearing the paper...

01:22:23.061 --> 01:22:27.675
There were boots in there,
men's work boots,

01:22:27.696 --> 01:22:32.516
holes in the toes,
chewed up laces and..

01:22:32.651 --> 01:22:34.280
caked in mud..

01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:39.230
Caked in mud and dog shit.

01:22:45.804 --> 01:22:48.155
Lord,

01:22:48.156 --> 01:22:53.711
my momma laughed for days.

01:22:59.464 --> 01:23:02.302
Please, don't tell me
that's the end of the story.

01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:04.530
Oh, no. That..

01:23:07.499 --> 01:23:09.511
That's the end.

01:23:10.493 --> 01:23:12.312
You never got the boots?

01:23:13.999 --> 01:23:16.465
No, huh-uh.

01:23:19.574 --> 01:23:22.352
My momma was a mean..
nasty-mean old lady.

01:23:27.696 --> 01:23:29.505
I suppose that's where I get it..

01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:32.242
..from.

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:40.080
You're not nasty-mean.
You're our mother and we love you.

01:25:17.496 --> 01:25:19.195
Is the coast clear?

01:25:20.094 --> 01:25:21.663
Never very.

01:25:23.039 --> 01:25:24.548
What are you watching?

01:25:24.549 --> 01:25:26.148
Television.

01:25:27.533 --> 01:25:29.513
Can I watch it with you?

01:25:29.514 --> 01:25:30.893
I wish you would.

01:25:38.825 --> 01:25:41.593
Are you mad at me?
- Nope.

01:25:47.616 --> 01:25:49.015
I was trying to be brave.

01:25:49.434 --> 01:25:50.893
I know.

01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:57.420
I just... I want everyone to know
that I got what I always wanted.

01:25:57.421 --> 01:26:01.667
And that means... I'm not a loser.
- Hey.  Hey.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:05.269
You're my hero.

01:26:15.838 --> 01:26:17.747
I wrote this for you.

01:26:17.748 --> 01:26:19.247
Sit down.

01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:36.206
<i>Well, I've never been a</i>

01:26:36.207 --> 01:26:40.224
<i>man of many words.</i>

01:26:42.683 --> 01:26:48.311
<i>And, there's nothing I could say
that you haven't never heard.</i>

01:26:50.679 --> 01:26:57.588
<i>But, I'll sing you love songs
till the day I die.</i>

01:26:57.866 --> 01:27:04.169
<i>The way I'm feeling,
I can't keep it inside.</i>

01:27:06.024 --> 01:27:11.820
I'll sing a sweet serenade whenever
you're feeling sad.

01:27:13.931 --> 01:27:19.819
<i>And, a lullaby each night
before you go to bed.</i>

01:27:22.481 --> 01:27:28.805
<i>I'll sing to you for the rest of your life..</i>
- Liberace!

01:27:29.534 --> 01:27:31.601
You better get yourself together,

01:27:31.602 --> 01:27:33.809
we have to get home and take care
of those damn dogs.

01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:35.309
They've probably eaten
the drapes by now.

01:27:36.128 --> 01:27:39.412
I'm sure the house is fine.
- Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has got the TV on.

01:27:39.413 --> 01:27:41.591
This one watches so
much television,

01:27:41.592 --> 01:27:43.654
it's rotted his brain.
- I'm sure that's not true.

01:27:43.655 --> 01:27:45.159
What was it I caught you
watching the other day?

01:27:46.177 --> 01:27:48.424
I don't remember.
- You do so remember,

01:27:48.425 --> 01:27:51.241
..some dumb talk show about
people swapping wives.

01:27:51.242 --> 01:27:52.440
I don't remember.

01:27:52.441 --> 01:27:56.707
Too bad there isn't a job where they
pay you to sit around watching TV.

01:27:56.708 --> 01:28:00.080
C'mon, Mattie Fae..
- Y'know he got fired from a shoe store?

01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:01.331
Mattie Fae.

01:28:01.332 --> 01:28:03.670
we're gonna get in
the car and go home.

01:28:04.589 --> 01:28:07.706
And if you say one more mean
thing to that boy..

01:28:07.956 --> 01:28:09.967
I'm going to kick
your fat Irish ass..

01:28:09.968 --> 01:28:12.228
onto the highway.
- What the hell did you say to me?

01:28:12.229 --> 01:28:15.291
You kids go outside,
would you please?

01:28:20.044 --> 01:28:21.872
I don't understand this meanness.

01:28:24.159 --> 01:28:25.968
I look at you and your sister..

01:28:26.517 --> 01:28:29.285
and the way you talk to people
and I don't understand it.

01:28:30.573 --> 01:28:33.211
I can't understand why
folks can't be

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.029
respectful of one another.

01:28:35.908 --> 01:28:37.766
I don't think there's
any excuse for it.

01:28:38.395 --> 01:28:40.892
My family didn't treat each other that way.
- Maybe that's because your family...

01:28:40.893 --> 01:28:45.399
You had better not say anything about
my family right now. I mean it.

01:28:48.495 --> 01:28:51.692
We buried a man I loved very much.

01:28:52.391 --> 01:28:54.258
And whatever faults..

01:28:54.259 --> 01:28:55.968
he may have had,

01:28:56.038 --> 01:28:57.925
he was a good, kind,

01:28:57.926 --> 01:28:59.884
decent man!

01:29:01.632 --> 01:29:03.960
And to hear you tear
into your own son.

01:29:04.349 --> 01:29:08.006
not even a day later that
dishonors Beverly's memory.

01:29:12.271 --> 01:29:14.819
We've been married
thirty-eight years.

01:29:15.538 --> 01:29:17.656
And I wouldn't trade them
for anything.

01:29:20.323 --> 01:29:23.161
ut if you can't find a
generous place in your heart

01:29:24.199 --> 01:29:26.298
for your own son,

01:29:26.947 --> 01:29:30.899
We're not going to make
it to thirty-nine!

01:29:54.529 --> 01:29:56.656
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
I froze.

01:29:56.657 --> 01:29:58.156
That's --

01:30:02.841 --> 01:30:04.809
you have a cigarette, hon?

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.054
No, I quit years ago.

01:30:08.055 --> 01:30:10.054
So did I.
Just sounded good to me.

01:30:14.499 --> 01:30:16.676
I thought at dinner...

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:19.005
at that horrible
dinner seemed like,

01:30:19.444 --> 01:30:21.982
something might be going on between
Ivy and Little Charles.

01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:25.002
Do you know if that's true?

01:30:27.056 --> 01:30:28.424
I'm not sure..
- just.

01:30:28.425 --> 01:30:30.134
Is it true?

01:30:33.777 --> 01:30:36.124
Yes. It's true.

01:30:36.125 --> 01:30:37.624
Okay.

01:30:38.375 --> 01:30:39.864
That can't happen.

01:30:40.203 --> 01:30:42.112
This is going to be difficult,

01:30:42.691 --> 01:30:44.449
 uh... Ivy and Little
Charles have always

01:30:44.589 --> 01:30:48.095
 marched to their own... and I'd
expect this to be toughest on you..

01:30:48.096 --> 01:30:49.403
Barb...?
- They're in love.

01:30:49.404 --> 01:30:53.145
They think they are. I know it's
unorthodox for cousins to get together,

01:30:53.146 --> 01:30:54.645
 ...at least these days.
- They're not cousins.

01:30:56.477 --> 01:30:58.106
Beg pardon?

01:31:00.573 --> 01:31:03.909
Little Charles is not your cousin.
He's your brother.

01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:05.878
He's your blood brother.

01:31:06.357 --> 01:31:07.936
Half brother.

01:31:09.604 --> 01:31:11.333
He's your father's child.

01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:14.629
Which means that he
is Ivy's brother.

01:31:17.242 --> 01:31:19.153
Do you see?

01:31:19.154 --> 01:31:21.251
Go away.

01:31:21.252 --> 01:31:23.389
We're just going to...
- Go away!  NOW!  GO AWAY!

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:24.889
All righ..alright.

01:31:29.644 --> 01:31:31.193
You and Dad.

01:31:31.872 --> 01:31:33.399
Who knows this?

01:31:33.400 --> 01:31:35.518
I do. And you do.

01:31:35.947 --> 01:31:39.095
Uncle Charlie doesn't suspect?
- We've never discussed it.

01:31:39.324 --> 01:31:42.792
What?
- We've never discussed it. Okay?

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.798
Did Dad know?

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.298
Yes.

01:31:47.646 --> 01:31:50.092
Y'know, I'm not proud of this.
- Really.

01:31:50.093 --> 01:31:51.702
You people amaze me.

01:31:51.852 --> 01:31:54.879
What, were you drunk? Was this just some..
- I wasn't drunk, no.

01:31:56.727 --> 01:31:59.223
Maybe it's hard for you to believe,
looking at me, knowing me the way

01:31:59.224 --> 01:32:03.129
you do, all these years. I mean, I know to you,
I'm just your old fat Aunt Mattie Fae.

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:05.289
I'm more than that, sweetheart,

01:32:06.257 --> 01:32:11.027
there's more to me than that.

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:16.726
I don't know why Little Charles
is such a disappointment to me.

01:32:16.727 --> 01:32:18.625
Maybe he,

01:32:20.603 --> 01:32:22.521
well, I don't know why.

01:32:25.798 --> 01:32:30.001
I'm disappointed for him,
more than anything.

01:32:36.677 --> 01:32:39.519
I made a mistake, a long time ago.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:43.938
Okay? I paid for it.

01:32:43.939 --> 01:32:46.957
But the mistake ends here.

01:32:48.964 --> 01:32:50.983
If Ivy found out,
it would destroy her.

01:32:51.022 --> 01:32:52.941
I'm sure as hell not
gonna tell her.

01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:57.802
You have to find a way to stop it.

01:32:57.803 --> 01:33:02.485
You have to put a stop to it.

01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:45.628
Hold it.

01:33:45.648 --> 01:33:47.396
Don't let it out.

01:33:48.215 --> 01:33:49.774
That's a kick, huh?

01:34:07.576 --> 01:34:10.689
If you won't look,
there's no point in showing them to you.

01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:12.590
Okay, okay.
I'll look.

01:34:12.591 --> 01:34:14.398
You're gonna get us
both in trouble.

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.397
I'm white and over thirty.
I don't get in trouble.

01:34:22.305 --> 01:34:23.696
Oh my God...

01:34:23.697 --> 01:34:25.196
Oh, my God!

01:34:25.727 --> 01:34:27.904
Goddamn it!
- Stop it!

01:34:27.905 --> 01:34:29.904
Stop! Stop!

01:34:31.831 --> 01:34:33.640
What is wrong with you?

01:34:35.857 --> 01:34:37.135
Steve!

01:34:37.136 --> 01:34:39.163
What happened?

01:34:39.164 --> 01:34:41.196
She was messing with Jean?

01:34:41.197 --> 01:34:42.395
Baby are you okay?

01:34:42.396 --> 01:34:45.403
Jean, what are you doing up?

01:34:45.404 --> 01:34:46.576
Do I need to call a doctor?

01:34:46.577 --> 01:34:48.405
I don't know.

01:34:49.244 --> 01:34:51.211
Johnna, what's going on?

01:34:51.212 --> 01:34:53.113
He was messing with Jean,
so, I tuned him up.

01:34:53.114 --> 01:34:54.613
Messing with, what do you mean,
messing with?

01:34:55.038 --> 01:34:57.315
He was kissing and grabbing her.

01:34:57.316 --> 01:34:58.868
I'll murder you, you prick!

01:34:58.869 --> 01:35:00.368
You know how old that girl is?

01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:04.947
She's fourteen years old!
- I didn't do anything!

01:35:04.948 --> 01:35:07.973
Are you out of your goddamn mind?
- Just back off, Barbara!

01:35:07.974 --> 01:35:09.782
That son-of-a-bitch is a sociopath!

01:35:09.783 --> 01:35:13.080
What is the matter with you?
Will you please stop freaking out?

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:15.009
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

01:35:15.218 --> 01:35:18.535
What are you even doing up?
- Sweetheart, we need to know what went on here.

01:35:18.794 --> 01:35:20.563
Nothing "went on."

01:35:20.992 --> 01:35:26.975
Nothing, okay? Can we not turn
everything a federal case here? okay..

01:35:26.976 --> 01:35:30.473
I came down smoked a little pot.
Smoked a little pot and..

01:35:31.012 --> 01:35:34.403
we were just goofing around and then
everything just got a little bit crazy.

01:35:34.404 --> 01:35:37.428
What have I told you about smoking that shit?!
- Then Johnna just chose to attack him with a shovel?

01:35:38.455 --> 01:35:41.111
Just tell me what he did!
- He didn't do anything!

01:35:41.112 --> 01:35:43.804
What's the big deal?
- The big deal, Jean,

01:35:43.805 --> 01:35:45.304
is that you're fourteen years old.

01:35:46.047 --> 01:35:48.086
Just a few years younger than
you like ‘em.

01:35:51.644 --> 01:35:53.642
I hate you!

01:35:53.643 --> 01:35:57.041
What's the matter with you?

01:35:57.995 --> 01:35:59.404
Jean.

01:36:07.845 --> 01:36:10.853
I can do without a speech.
- Where is he?

01:36:10.854 --> 01:36:14.220
Out at the car. We're leaving.
Back to Florida, tonight, now.

01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:16.177
Me and Steve, together.

01:36:16.197 --> 01:36:19.457
You wannna give me some grief about that?
- Now you wait goddamn it.

01:36:19.458 --> 01:36:22.438
You better find out from Jean
exactly what went on..

01:36:22.439 --> 01:36:23.636
before you start pointing fingers.

01:36:23.637 --> 01:36:27.372
Because, I doubt Jean's
blameless in all this.

01:36:27.373 --> 01:36:29.762
And I'm not saying
that I blame her..

01:36:29.763 --> 01:36:34.042
just cause I said she's not blameless,
It doesn't mean I've blamed her.

01:36:34.043 --> 01:36:38.616
I'm saying she might
share in the responsibility.

01:36:39.104 --> 01:36:40.871
It's not cut and dried,

01:36:40.872 --> 01:36:44.568
It lives where everything lives,
somewhere in the middle.

01:36:44.569 --> 01:36:46.355
Where the rest of us live,

01:36:46.356 --> 01:36:48.500
everyone but you.
- Karen--

01:36:48.501 --> 01:36:50.433
I'm no angel myself.

01:36:50.892 --> 01:36:53.170
I've done some things
I'm not proud of.

01:36:54.289 --> 01:36:56.137
Things you'll never know about.

01:36:56.646 --> 01:36:59.614
And, I may even have to do some
things I'm not proud of again.

01:37:00.822 --> 01:37:05.613
Cause, life puts you
in a corner that way.

01:37:06.986 --> 01:37:10.798
Anyway..
You have your own hash to settle.

01:37:10.799 --> 01:37:14.946
Before you start making
speeches to the rest of us.

01:37:15.797 --> 01:37:19.696
And, Come January...
I'll be in Belize.

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:26.175
Doesn't that sound nice?

01:37:40.552 --> 01:37:44.813
I'm taking Jean with me, heading
back to Colorado in the morning.

01:37:50.193 --> 01:37:51.922
You're never coming back to me,
Are you, Bill?

01:37:57.456 --> 01:37:59.234
Never say, never.

01:38:03.190 --> 01:38:04.659
But no.

01:38:08.894 --> 01:38:11.182
And I'll probably never really
understand why, am I?

01:38:17.555 --> 01:38:19.094
Probably not.

01:38:58.834 --> 01:39:00.813
Where are Bill and Jean going?

01:39:01.611 --> 01:39:03.430
Karen, left too?

01:39:04.029 --> 01:39:05.418
Yeah.

01:39:05.777 --> 01:39:07.496
Is mom clean?

01:39:09.683 --> 01:39:12.429
She's moderately clean.
- Moderately?

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:13.910
You don't like moderately?
Then let's say..

01:39:13.911 --> 01:39:15.109
...tolerably.
Is she clean, or not?

01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:16.609
Back off.
- I'm nervous.

01:39:18.954 --> 01:39:20.531
Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.
- I have to tell her, though.

01:39:20.532 --> 01:39:22.481
We're leaving for
New York tomorrow.

01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:25.868
I don't think, it's a good idea.
For you and Charles to take this any further.

01:39:26.167 --> 01:39:27.631
Where is this coming from?

01:39:27.632 --> 01:39:28.792
There's lot of fish in the sea.

01:39:28.793 --> 01:39:32.430
Surely you can rule out the one single
man in the world you're related to.

01:39:32.431 --> 01:39:33.629
I love the man I'm related to.

01:39:33.630 --> 01:39:37.155
Fuck love, what a crock of shit.
Love..

01:39:37.156 --> 01:39:41.644
People can convince themselves
they love a painted rock.

01:39:42.241 --> 01:39:44.687
Looks great. What is it?

01:39:44.688 --> 01:39:45.886
Catfish.

01:39:45.887 --> 01:39:48.623
Bottom feeders, my favorite.

01:39:48.624 --> 01:39:52.438
You're nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you
can't go to New York, you'll break a hip.

01:39:52.439 --> 01:39:56.363
Here, Eat your catfish.
- Oh, you're infuriating..

01:39:56.364 --> 01:39:59.345
I'm not the one,
who's fucking my cousin.

01:39:59.378 --> 01:40:01.181
I have lived in this town,
year in and year out,

01:40:01.182 --> 01:40:03.408
hoping against hope someone
would come into my life..

01:40:03.409 --> 01:40:05.737
Don't get all Carson
McCullers on me.

01:40:05.738 --> 01:40:11.609
Now, wipe that tragic look off
your face and eat some catfish.

01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:20.376
Howdy, Mom.
- What's howdy about it?

01:40:20.377 --> 01:40:22.522
Look, catfish for lunch.
Johnna!

01:40:22.523 --> 01:40:25.435
You hungry?
- Ivy, you should smile. Like me.

01:40:25.436 --> 01:40:27.821
Mom needs her lunch, please.

01:40:27.822 --> 01:40:29.602
I'm not hungry.

01:40:29.603 --> 01:40:31.893
You didn't eaten anything today.
You didn't eat anything yesterday.

01:40:31.894 --> 01:40:33.092
I'm not hungry.

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.435
You're eating, do what I say.

01:40:35.436 --> 01:40:37.874
Everyone do what I say.

01:40:37.875 --> 01:40:41.791
Why aren't either
of you is dressed?

01:40:41.961 --> 01:40:43.608
It's not like we're
sitting here naked.

01:40:43.609 --> 01:40:46.167
Right, we are dressed.
Or, should we be dressed up?

01:40:46.287 --> 01:40:48.285
Right, cos you're
coming over for fish?

01:40:48.424 --> 01:40:50.872
I'll eat in my room.
- That's fine, thank you.

01:40:53.699 --> 01:40:54.811
Eat.
- No.

01:40:54.812 --> 01:40:56.311
Eat it, Mom.

01:40:56.826 --> 01:40:58.483
Eat it.
- No.

01:40:58.484 --> 01:41:00.581
Eat it, you fucker.
Eat that catfish.

01:41:00.582 --> 01:41:01.780
Go to hell.

01:41:01.781 --> 01:41:04.782
That ain't cutting fucking ice with me.
Eat that fucking fish.

01:41:04.783 --> 01:41:05.981
Mom, I have something to talk to you about.
- No you don't.

01:41:05.982 --> 01:41:08.380
Barbara--
- No you don't. Shut up.

01:41:08.381 --> 01:41:09.223
Shut the fuck up.

01:41:09.224 --> 01:41:12.260
Please--
- What's to talk about?

01:41:12.261 --> 01:41:15.409
Forget it. Eat that fucking fish.
- I'm not hungry.

01:41:15.410 --> 01:41:16.735
EAT THE FISH, BITCH!

01:41:16.736 --> 01:41:17.934
Barbara...!

01:41:17.935 --> 01:41:22.232
Okay, fine, fuck it,
do what you want.

01:41:26.217 --> 01:41:28.385
I have to tell you something.

01:41:29.094 --> 01:41:31.408
Ivy's a lesbian.
- Barbara--

01:41:31.409 --> 01:41:33.628
No, you're not.
- No, I'm not--

01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:35.317
Yes, you are.
Did you eat your fish?

01:41:35.318 --> 01:41:36.516
Barbara, stop it!

01:41:36.517 --> 01:41:38.960
Mom, please.
This is important.

01:41:38.961 --> 01:41:42.357
Eat your fish. Eat your fish.
Eat your fish.

01:41:42.358 --> 01:41:44.407
What the fuck!

01:41:44.408 --> 01:41:47.694
I have something to say.
- Are we breaking shit now? huh?

01:41:47.695 --> 01:41:49.564
‘cause I can break shit!

01:41:50.502 --> 01:41:52.779
Hey, see, we can all break shit.

01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:55.046
Charles and I..
- You don't want to break shit with me,

01:41:55.047 --> 01:41:56.546
muthah-fuckah..
- Charles and I

01:41:57.216 --> 01:41:58.543
Johnna?! Little spill in here!

01:41:58.544 --> 01:41:59.742
Barbara, stop it!

01:41:59.743 --> 01:42:03.678
Mom, Charles and I..

01:42:03.679 --> 01:42:06.351
Little Charles.
- Barbara --

01:42:06.352 --> 01:42:09.625
You gotta say Little Charles or she is
not gonna know who you're talking about.

01:42:11.102 --> 01:42:12.471
Little Charles and I...

01:42:13.929 --> 01:42:15.358
Little Charles and I are --

01:42:15.827 --> 01:42:18.705
Little Charles and you
are brother and sister.

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:20.942
I know that.

01:42:23.549 --> 01:42:25.388
What? No,

01:42:25.507 --> 01:42:26.715
Little Charles and I..

01:42:26.716 --> 01:42:28.575
I've always known that.

01:42:31.212 --> 01:42:33.010
I told you, nobody
slips anything by me.

01:42:33.010 --> 01:42:35.370
Mom --
- Don't listen.

01:42:36.746 --> 01:42:38.774
I knew the whole time
Bev and Mattie Fae were carrying on.

01:42:38.854 --> 01:42:42.491
Charlie should have known too,
if he wasn't smoking all that grass.

01:42:42.492 --> 01:42:44.539
It's the pills talking.
- Pills can't talk.

01:42:45.657 --> 01:42:47.494
Your father tore
himself up over it,

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:50.416
thirty some-odd years, but..

01:42:50.642 --> 01:42:54.267
Beverly wouldn't have been Beverly if
he didn't have plenty to brood about.

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:57.496
Mom, what are you about?

01:42:57.497 --> 01:43:00.662
Better you girls know now though,
now you're older.

01:43:00.663 --> 01:43:04.117
You never know when someone
might need a kidney.

01:43:06.316 --> 01:43:08.893
Why in God's name
did you tell me this?

01:43:08.894 --> 01:43:10.473
Hey, what do you care?

01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:15.688
You're monsters.

01:43:16.167 --> 01:43:18.165
Come on now!
- Monsters...

01:43:18.664 --> 01:43:23.016
Who's the injured party here?

01:43:24.828 --> 01:43:28.235
Ivy, listen...
- You will never see me, again.

01:43:28.414 --> 01:43:31.036
Mattie Fae told me,
I didn't know what to do.

01:43:31.037 --> 01:43:32.070
I was trying to protect you.

01:43:32.071 --> 01:43:34.420
We'll go anyway,
we'll still go away.

01:43:34.421 --> 01:43:38.041
This is not my fault.
Mom told you! It wasn't me, it was Mom!

01:43:38.155 --> 01:43:40.023
There's no difference.

01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:06.537
Ivy..Ivy!

01:44:16.424 --> 01:44:18.810
Ivy!

01:44:54.868 --> 01:44:58.803
We couldn't let Ivy run off
with Little Charles.

01:44:59.373 --> 01:45:01.152
Just wouldn't be right.

01:45:03.969 --> 01:45:05.737
She'll be back.

01:45:07.495 --> 01:45:11.667
She's a sweet girl, Ivy,
and I love her to death. But..

01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:14.698
she isn't strong.

01:45:15.357 --> 01:45:16.716
Not like you.

01:45:17.905 --> 01:45:19.683
Or me.

01:45:20.272 --> 01:45:24.347
You knew about Daddy
and Mattie Fae?

01:45:24.668 --> 01:45:25.756
Oh sure.

01:45:25.757 --> 01:45:27.256
Sure.

01:45:27.715 --> 01:45:29.294
But, I never told them I knew.

01:45:30.112 --> 01:45:31.801
But your father knew.
He knew I knew.

01:45:33.269 --> 01:45:35.158
But, we never talked about it.

01:45:37.075 --> 01:45:40.971
I chose the higher ground.

01:45:41.681 --> 01:45:44.309
If I'd had the chance,
there at the end,

01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:45.809
I would've..

01:45:45.957 --> 01:45:49.900
I would've told him,
"I hope this isn't about Little Charles,

01:45:49.901 --> 01:45:53.009
cause you know I know
all about that."

01:45:53.010 --> 01:45:56.168
If I'd reached him at that motel,
I would've said,

01:45:56.169 --> 01:45:57.668
"You'd be better off if you quit

01:45:57.915 --> 01:46:01.212
sulking about this
ancient history."

01:46:03.309 --> 01:46:04.958
..what motel?

01:46:05.117 --> 01:46:07.386
I called over there on Monday

01:46:07.875 --> 01:46:11.412
after I got into that safety deposit box.
But it was too late,

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.153
he'd checked out.

01:46:14.154 --> 01:46:16.208
How did you know where he was?

01:46:16.209 --> 01:46:21.980
The note. He said I could call him
over at the Country Squire Motel.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.239
He left a note?

01:46:24.518 --> 01:46:28.192
And I did, I called
over there on Monday.

01:46:28.364 --> 01:46:30.371
After you got your money,

01:46:30.372 --> 01:46:31.901
out of your safety deposit box...

01:46:35.167 --> 01:46:36.776
We had..

01:46:36.986 --> 01:46:39.633
..an arrangement.
You have to understand,

01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:43.318
for people like your father and me,

01:46:43.319 --> 01:46:46.327
who never had any money,
ever, as kids,

01:46:47.095 --> 01:46:51.078
people from our generation,
that money is important.

01:46:51.079 --> 01:46:52.578
If you could've stopped Daddy

01:46:53.819 --> 01:46:59.261
from killing himself, you wouldn't have
needed to get into your safety deposit box.

01:47:01.731 --> 01:47:04.049
Well, hindsight's always twenty
twenty, isn't it?

01:47:04.598 --> 01:47:07.176
Did the note say he was
going to kill himself?

01:47:09.043 --> 01:47:10.502
Mom?

01:47:13.039 --> 01:47:15.016
If I had my..

01:47:15.017 --> 01:47:18.614
wits about me, maybe
I might've done it different. But..

01:47:19.093 --> 01:47:20.572
I was,

01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.618
your father and me both,

01:47:23.619 --> 01:47:26.486
we were...
- You were both fucked-up...

01:47:26.926 --> 01:47:28.894
You were fucked-up...

01:47:30.292 --> 01:47:31.806
You are fucked-up.

01:47:31.807 --> 01:47:37.965
You'd better understand this,
you smug little ingrate.

01:47:38.734 --> 01:47:42.870
There's only  one reason Beverly
killed himself and that's you.

01:47:43.009 --> 01:47:47.353
Think there's any way he would've done
what he did if you were still here?

01:47:47.354 --> 01:47:48.783
No,

01:47:48.784 --> 01:47:53.388
just him and me,
in this house, alone in the dark,

01:47:53.389 --> 01:47:57.454
abandoned, wasted lifetimes
devoted to your care and comfort.

01:47:57.455 --> 01:47:58.834
Oh, yes..

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:04.027
You stick that knife of judgment in me,
go ahead, but make no mistake,

01:48:04.028 --> 01:48:07.216
his blood is just as much on
your hands as it is on mine.

01:48:08.364 --> 01:48:09.823
He did this though,

01:48:10.132 --> 01:48:12.970
This is his doing, not ours.

01:48:15.197 --> 01:48:20.421
Can you imagine anything more cruel,
to make me responsible?

01:48:20.422 --> 01:48:21.620
Why?

01:48:21.621 --> 01:48:25.598
Just to weaken me,
make me prove my character?

01:48:25.599 --> 01:48:29.888
So, No. I waited, I waited to get my
hands on that safety deposit box.

01:48:29.889 --> 01:48:31.655
But, I would have waited anyway.

01:48:31.656 --> 01:48:34.666
You want to show
who's stronger, Bev?

01:48:34.667 --> 01:48:38.446
Nobody's stronger than me, goddamn it.
When nothing is left,

01:48:38.447 --> 01:48:40.986
when everything is gone
and disappeared,

01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:43.917
I'll be here.

01:48:48.004 --> 01:48:50.562
Who's stronger now,
you son-of-a-bitch?!

01:48:54.323 --> 01:48:56.101
You're right, Mom.

01:48:56.102 --> 01:49:00.453
You're the strong one.

01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:14.998
Barbara?

01:49:19.383 --> 01:49:21.132
Barbara?

01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:24.868
Oh, Barb?

01:49:25.277 --> 01:49:27.415
Barbara?!

01:49:30.612 --> 01:49:33.200
Barbara?

01:49:37.285 --> 01:49:39.034
Barbara?!!

01:49:53.349 --> 01:49:54.968
Ivy?!

01:49:58.474 --> 01:50:00.372
Ivy, you here?!

01:51:04.917 --> 01:51:06.756
Johnna?!

01:51:26.096 --> 01:51:27.865
Johnna?!

01:51:35.696 --> 01:51:37.725
Johnna?!

01:51:46.855 --> 01:51:51.603
And then you're gone, and Beverly,

01:54:12.714 --> 01:54:16.828
