00:53.429 --> 00:56.974
<i>Once in a while when I wake up</i>

00:58.100 --> 01:00.811
<i>I find myself crying.</i>

01:01.771 --> 01:05.483
<i>The dream I must have had
I can never recall.</i>

01:06.067 --> 01:07.067
But...

01:07.693 --> 01:08.693
But...

01:08.861 --> 01:11.822
<i>the sensation that I've lost something</i>

01:12.114 --> 01:15.618
<i>lingers for a long time after I wake up.</i>

01:23.542 --> 01:25.503
<i>I'm always searching</i>

01:25.753 --> 01:28.005
<i>for something, for someone.</i>

01:28.464 --> 01:33.385
<i>This feeling has possessed me
I think from that clay...</i>

01:34.637 --> 01:37.807
<i>That day when the stars came falling.</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:39.767
<i>It was almost as if...</i>

01:39.892 --> 01:42.770
<i>as if a scene from a dream.</i>

01:43.145 --> 01:45.022
<i>Nothing more, nothing less</i>

01:46.232 --> 01:48.526
<i>than a beautiful view.</i>

01:48.901 --> 01:53.030
<i>Ah, if only our voices speak at night</i>

01:54.323 --> 01:59.537
<i>could ever reach the very edge
of this World, and the time</i>

01:59.912 --> 02:04.416
<i>Instead of fading into air and dust</i>

02:04.875 --> 02:10.381
<i>Then what will the words could ever be?
Farthest words from 'probably'</i>

02:10.548 --> 02:16.762
<i>Let's make a promise, that will never fade
Let's say it together in count of three, oh</i>

02:27.731 --> 02:30.693
<i>Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish
will be heard</i>

02:30.860 --> 02:34.613
<i>But lately I lost sight of
the truth in those words</i>

02:34.697 --> 02:38.450
<i>I can't even remember when I gave up
believing What could have been the reason?</i>

02:38.576 --> 02:44.123
<i>Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop
And the place rainbow born and dies</i>

02:44.248 --> 02:46.292
<i>And where the end of this life lies</i>

02:46.417 --> 02:50.462
<i>I've always been insisting
there was something that I've longing for</i>

02:54.675 --> 02:59.763
<i>One day we'll reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented</i>

02:59.889 --> 03:04.435
<i>We 'll high-five love we've yet to
discover and give a kiss to time</i>

03:04.602 --> 03:10.149
<i>The five dimensions keep on teasing me
But I will keep on looking at you, dear</i>

03:10.524 --> 03:14.153
<i>Let's make a sign for when we say
"nice to meet you" again</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:19.408
<i>I'm on my way to you,
chasing after your name</i>

03:45.768 --> 03:48.979
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

03:50.606 --> 03:52.274
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

03:54.985 --> 03:56.528
My name is...

03:58.072 --> 03:59.072
Mitsuha!

04:35.317 --> 04:37.444
Mitsuha, what are you doing?

04:37.528 --> 04:40.990
Well, it feels incredibly realistic...

04:41.991 --> 04:43.951
What? "Mitsuha"?

04:44.034 --> 04:46.662
Are you half asleep? Breakfast!

04:47.413 --> 04:48.831
Hurry UP!

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
What? What?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.448
Do you want last night's leftovers?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.991
You can have it.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.160
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:26.285 --> 05:27.828
Mitsuha, you're late!

05:27.953 --> 05:30.122
I'll make breakfast tomorrow.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.046
Is this too much?

05:37.379 --> 05:38.714
Oh well.

05:39.048 --> 05:40.632
You're normal today.

05:41.050 --> 05:43.052
You were nuts yesterday.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.304
What are you talking about?

05:47.014 --> 05:50.059
<i>Good morning, even/one.</i>

05:51.101 --> 05:54.730
<i>This is an announcement
from Itomori Town Hall.</i>

05:55.898 --> 05:58.734
<i>Regarding the mayoral election</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:03.405
<i>to be held on the 20th next month,
the election committee...</i>

06:06.492 --> 06:12.373
"Comet to pass by in a month:
Visible to the naked eye"

06:12.915 --> 06:17.002
<i>The comet will be visible
to the naked eye for several days...</i>

06:17.127 --> 06:19.004
Just make it up with him.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.381
It's an adult matter.

06:20.506 --> 06:23.758
<i>"Position of Comet</i> Tiamat" <i>$4264 are preparing
to observe the celestial show of the century.</i>

06:23.759 --> 06:26.399
<i>JAXA are preparing to observe
the celestial show of the century.</i>

06:41.485 --> 06:43.112
We're going now!

07:03.465 --> 07:05.426
Study hard!

07:10.722 --> 07:12.015
Mitsuha!

07:12.266 --> 07:14.017
Morning, Sayaka, Tessie.

07:14.143 --> 07:15.143
Morning.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.021
- Get off.
- Why? Meanie.

07:18.147 --> 07:19.815
- You're heavy.
- That's rude.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.109
You two get along so well.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.569
We do not!

07:26.029 --> 07:28.532
Your hair looks all right today.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.700
What?

07:29.825 --> 07:33.537
- Yeah, did your grandma exorcise you?
- Exorcise?

07:33.662 --> 07:35.414
You were totally possessed!

07:35.747 --> 07:40.919
Cut out the occultism.
Mitsuha is just stressed. Right?

07:41.044 --> 07:43.755
Huh? What are you talking about?

07:43.839 --> 07:45.048
You don't remember?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.051
And above all,

07:48.635 --> 07:53.724
restoring the town's fiscal health
to continue its revitalization project!

07:54.183 --> 07:56.018
Only when these are achieved

07:56.268 --> 07:59.563
can a safe and secure community
be created!

08:00.022 --> 08:02.149
As the incumbent mayor...

08:02.274 --> 08:04.985
He'll be reelected again anyway.

08:05.110 --> 08:07.571
I heard he's been dishing out the pork.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.656
Hey, Miyamizu.

08:09.781 --> 08:10.908
Morning.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.870
So the mayor's kid and
his contractor's kid get along too.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.079
Ew.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.835
Mitsuha!

08:22.794 --> 08:24.713
Stand up straight!

08:25.797 --> 08:28.592
- He's strict with his family.
- I'm impressed.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.094
- So embarrassing.
- Sucks to be her.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.597
Mitsuha.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.517
In front of everybody...

08:40.020 --> 08:41.104
"Who are you?"

08:48.737 --> 08:51.113
"Tasokare" (Twilight)

08:51.114 --> 08:56.078
"Tasokare" means "Who is that" and is
the origin of the word "tasogare-doki."

08:56.745 --> 08:59.915
Twilight, when it's
neither day nor night.

09:00.582 --> 09:05.629
When the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human.

09:06.380 --> 09:10.008
Older expressions include
"karetaso-doki"

09:10.717 --> 09:16.139
"Karetaso/Kawatare = Who is that?"

09:16.390 --> 09:20.185
Kataware-doki? I think
that's a local dialect.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.021
I've heard that Itomori's elderly
still use classical language.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.150
"Who are you?"

09:28.569 --> 09:30.612
OK next, Mitsuha.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.114
Yes.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.159
Oh, so you remember your name today.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.163
You don't remember?

09:42.207 --> 09:46.378
Yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.339
You had bedhead and no ribbon.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.469
What? No way! Really?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.888
It was like you had amnesia.

09:57.014 --> 10:01.351
Well, I do feel like
I've been in a strange dream lately...

10:01.935 --> 10:04.855
A dream about someone else's life?

10:05.063 --> 10:08.066
I can't remember clearly.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.652
I know! That was...

10:10.777 --> 10:11.987
your previous life!

10:12.070 --> 10:16.116
Or maybe your subconscious
linked to the Everett multiverse...

10:16.241 --> 10:17.409
Stay out of this.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.079
Oh! Tessie, did you write that
in my notebook?

10:22.873 --> 10:24.166
Nothing.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.879
But Mitsuha, you really were
a bit weird yesterday.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.131
You been feeling alright?

10:32.174 --> 10:35.344
That's so strange. I feel fine.

10:35.510 --> 10:39.306
Maybe it's stress.
That ritual is coming up, isn't it?

10:39.431 --> 10:42.017
Oh, don't remind me!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.394
I can't stand this town anymore.

10:45.145 --> 10:50.692
It's too small and close-knit.
I want to graduate and go to Tokyo.

10:50.859 --> 10:55.697
I don't blame you.
There's really nothing in this town.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.368
Trains come every 2 hours.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.411
The store closes at 9 p.m.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.372
No bookstore. No dentist.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.916
"Pub Mother" "Pub Cat's Eye"
But 2 pubs for some reason.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.042
No jobs.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.209
No brides.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.170
Short sunlight hours.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.716
- Give me a break!
- What?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.345
I mean... How about we stop by a café?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.680
- A café?
- Really?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.181
Where?

11:25.394 --> 11:26.561
Hello.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.397
Hello.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.569
This is a café?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.697
You knew there wasn't one.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.366
Mitsuha just went home.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.953
Things must be rough for her.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.414
Well, she takes center stage.

11:45.539 --> 11:46.915
Yeah.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.253
Hey, Tessie.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.046
What?

11:53.130 --> 11:55.882
What will you do after you graduate?

11:56.007 --> 11:58.760
What's this?
You asking about my future?

12:00.595 --> 12:06.059
Nothing special. I'll probably keep on
living a normal life in this town.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.744
I'd rather do that too.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.496
You're not ready yet, Yotsuha.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.957
Listen to the thread's voice.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.294
When you keep twining like that,

12:32.461 --> 12:36.631
emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.258
Threads don't talk.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.552
She means, "Concentrate."

12:40.677 --> 12:46.349
1,000 years of It0mori's history is etched
into our braided cords.

12:46.475 --> 12:50.270
Listen. 200 years ago...

12:50.479 --> 12:52.022
Here she goes again.

12:52.147 --> 12:58.779
Sandal maker Mayugords bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area.

12:59.321 --> 13:02.240
The shrine and old documents
were destroyed

13:02.657 --> 13:03.950
and this is known <i>as...</i>

13:04.159 --> 13:05.994
The Great Fire of Mayugoro.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.956
The fire has his name? Poor Mayugoro.

13:10.999 --> 13:16.630
So the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.593
But even if words are lost,
tradition should be handed down.

13:21.718 --> 13:26.097
That's the important task
we at Miyamizu Shrine have.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.813
But that foolish son-in-law...

13:34.105 --> 13:38.026
As if leaving Shinto priesthood and
this house weren't enough,

13:38.360 --> 13:41.029
now politics? He's hopeless.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.490
Have another, my man.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.912
I'm counting on your help again.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.247
Leave it to me.

13:50.664 --> 13:54.125
You'll get votes from the
Kadoiri and Sakagami Districts.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.544
How's it going with her?

13:55.710 --> 13:57.712
It's not that easy.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.424
I smell corruption.

14:01.550 --> 14:03.260
Don't be ridiculous.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.929
Bring us a few more hot <i>sake.</i>

14:06.054 --> 14:07.222
OK.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.891
Katsuhiko, work on site this weekend.

14:10.058 --> 14:12.143
Learn how to use explosives.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.353
Can't hear you.

14:14.521 --> 14:15.521
Yes!

14:28.994 --> 14:31.913
We both have it rough, don't we?

14:50.181 --> 14:53.059
Is that Yotsuha? She's all grown up.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.812
They're both pretty like their mother.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.565
Hey.

14:58.940 --> 14:59.940
Hey.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.601
It's the oldest <i>sake</i> in the world.

15:35.310 --> 15:40.565
By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and
letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.

15:40.690 --> 15:45.612
"Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate
sake made that way?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.489
Of course they do.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.826
Hey, look. It's Miyamizu.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.751
Oh! I could never do that!

15:59.918 --> 16:01.544
Isn't she embarrassed?

16:01.670 --> 16:03.421
I can't believe it.

16:17.644 --> 16:22.732
Cheer up, Mitsuha. Who cares
if a few classmates saw you?

16:22.857 --> 16:25.944
I envy your pre-pubescent
lack of concern.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.824
Why not sell lots of kuchikamisake and
use the money to go to Tokyo?

16:31.074 --> 16:33.451
Where do you get such ideas?

16:33.576 --> 16:38.832
Sell them with photos and making videos.
Name it "Shrine Maiden's Sake."

16:39.374 --> 16:40.709
You'll make money!

16:41.918 --> 16:43.795
"Shrine Maiden's <i>Sake"</i>

16:44.337 --> 16:46.548
No. That breaks the Liquor Tax Law.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.843
That's the problem?

16:56.224 --> 17:01.104
I hate this town! I hate this life!

17:01.229 --> 17:05.525
Please make me a handsome
Tokyo boy in my next life!

17:09.738 --> 17:11.698
What a fool...

17:39.559 --> 17:40.560
Ow!

17:43.313 --> 17:45.398
Ouch...

17:53.948 --> 17:55.283
Where...

18:06.461 --> 18:08.588
Somethings there...

18:22.644 --> 18:23.644
Ow!

18:23.812 --> 18:25.647
Taki! Are you up?

18:27.899 --> 18:31.152
It was your turn to cook.
Wake up on time.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.487
I'm sorry.

18:33.988 --> 18:37.325
I'm going now. Drink all the miso soup.

18:37.784 --> 18:38.784
OK.

18:38.952 --> 18:42.455
Go to school even if you're late.
See you.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.333
Have a nice day.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.720
What a strange dream.

18:59.389 --> 19:02.350
"From Tsukasa:
Run, you're late!"

19:03.184 --> 19:07.355
What? Who's it from?
Tsukasa? Who's that?

19:17.365 --> 19:19.033
I have to use the bathroom.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.752
This is too realistic.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.096
"Shinjuku Station"

20:40.865 --> 20:42.992
I'm in Tokyo.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.624
"Jingu High School"

20:49.958 --> 20:51.626
- Where'd you get it?
- Daikanyama.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.628
The front act at the next gig...

20:53.878 --> 20:56.631
Let's skip club and go to a movie.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.637
Taki!

21:04.472 --> 21:07.433
Arriving at noon, huh? Let's eat lunch.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.103
You ignored my text.

21:10.228 --> 21:11.980
Oh, Tsukasa?

21:12.105 --> 21:14.899
At least you sound apologetic.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.903
- You got lost?
- Yeah.

21:19.112 --> 21:22.657
How could you get lost
on the way to school?

21:22.824 --> 21:26.327
- Uh... Well... I (watashi)...
- Feminine?

21:26.494 --> 21:27.870
I (watakushi)!

21:28.496 --> 21:29.580
<i>I</i> (boku)?

21:30.164 --> 21:31.164
<i>I</i> (ore)?

21:33.459 --> 21:38.840
I was enjoying myself.
It's so festive and all in Tokyo.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.426
You seem to have a dialect.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.678
Where's your lunch?

21:44.220 --> 21:46.806
- Geez.
- Are you half asleep?

21:46.931 --> 21:50.018
- You got something?
- Croquette-egg sandwich sounds good!

21:54.355 --> 21:55.773
Thank you.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.027
Let's go to a café.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.696
Oh that one? OK. Coming, Taki?

22:01.863 --> 22:04.490
What? What? What?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.284
A café?

22:09.704 --> 22:11.372
Nice timberwork up there.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.666
Yeah, attention to detail.

22:13.791 --> 22:15.335
Taki, have you decided?

22:16.586 --> 22:20.798
What? I could live for a month
for the price of these!

22:21.049 --> 22:23.634
What age are you from again?

22:23.760 --> 22:27.555
Hmm. Oh well. It's a dream anyway.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.897
What a great dream.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.322
Oh no, what should I do?
I'm late for work!

22:44.989 --> 22:46.741
Your shift is today?

22:46.949 --> 22:48.910
- Go, then.
- Oh, yeah.

22:50.244 --> 22:52.330
Oh! Um...

22:53.623 --> 22:56.250
Where do I work?

22:56.417 --> 22:57.835
What?

23:03.966 --> 23:06.177
Tables 6, 7, and 10 are waiting!

23:06.469 --> 23:08.388
Table 12! Taki!

23:09.514 --> 23:10.848
Here you go.

23:10.973 --> 23:13.851
Uh, zucchini and tomato salad...

23:13.976 --> 23:15.353
We didn't order that.

23:15.603 --> 23:17.855
Taki, I said no more truffles!

23:18.189 --> 23:19.857
Taki, can't hear you!

23:20.108 --> 23:21.108
Taki!

23:22.610 --> 23:24.862
When is this dream going to end?

23:33.454 --> 23:35.581
Hey. Hey waiter.

23:35.706 --> 23:36.874
Oh, yes?

23:39.043 --> 23:41.796
There was a toothpick in our pizza.

23:42.672 --> 23:45.383
We could have gotten hurt.

23:45.842 --> 23:49.971
Good thing I noticed.
What do you have to say?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.140
<i>Uh, we...</i>

23:52.932 --> 23:56.978
But... There are no toothpicks
in an Italian restaurant's...

23:58.771 --> 24:00.064
Excuse me.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.358
Is everything OK?

24:03.484 --> 24:04.484
I'll handle this.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.072
What's wrong with you today?

24:09.323 --> 24:12.660
Please accept our apologies.
Your meal is on the house.

24:12.743 --> 24:13.786
Oh, really?

24:13.911 --> 24:16.038
I hope you weren't hurt.

24:26.549 --> 24:27.549
Um...

24:27.842 --> 24:28.843
Okudera...

24:29.010 --> 24:30.010
Ms.Okudera.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.972
<i>Ms.Okudera.</i> Thank <i>you...</i>

24:33.097 --> 24:34.515
A stroke of bad luck today.

24:34.640 --> 24:35.641
No, uh...

24:35.766 --> 24:37.185
Bet it was a set-up.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.813
Handled it according to the manual, but...

24:41.522 --> 24:44.358
Oh, Ms.Okudera, your skirt!

24:45.776 --> 24:46.776
You OK?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.696
- What happened?
- Slashed.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.698
That dick from earlier?

24:51.115 --> 24:53.242
What now? Do you remember his face?

24:53.367 --> 24:54.619
No.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.454
Come with me.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.372
Hey, Taki!

24:59.373 --> 25:01.042
Take off your skirt.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.503
Oh! I'll look the other way!

25:07.798 --> 25:09.675
This won't take long.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.139
Done!

25:16.807 --> 25:19.894
Wow, Taki! It looks better than before!

25:22.063 --> 25:25.191
Thank you for saving me today.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.404
Actually, I was concerned about you.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.658
You're weak but quick-tempered.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.410
I like you better today.

25:37.370 --> 25:40.748
Never knew you had a feminine side.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.918
"JR Yamanote Line: 8 min."

25:51.509 --> 25:55.012
What a realistic dream
if I say so myself.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.435
Oh, he keeps a diary.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.942
He's so organized.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.695
Wish I lived in Tokyo too.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.449
Oh! That's her!

26:20.997 --> 26:22.832
A crush, maybe?

26:28.629 --> 26:34.468
"Walked to the station with Ms.Okudera
after work, thanks to my feminine powers!"

26:36.262 --> 26:37.305
"Who are you?"

26:46.856 --> 26:50.818
"Mitsuha"

27:06.417 --> 27:07.835
What is this?

27:07.960 --> 27:09.337
"Mitsuha"

27:12.465 --> 27:14.842
Wham? Wham?

27:15.009 --> 27:16.885
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"
What's going on?

27:16.886 --> 27:18.126
"Thanks to my feminine powers!"

27:18.471 --> 27:19.764
Let's go to a café again.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.183
Sorry, I have to go to work.

27:22.350 --> 27:24.185
Do you remember where to go'?

27:26.520 --> 27:30.107
Tsukasa, did you prank my phone and...

27:30.858 --> 27:33.694
Oh, never mind. See you.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.490
He's acting normal today.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.326
Yesterday he was kind of cute.

27:40.451 --> 27:41.451
What?

27:44.080 --> 27:46.040
Wha... What?

27:46.207 --> 27:48.417
Taki, you tried to outdo us!

27:48.542 --> 27:50.211
You walked home with her!

27:53.047 --> 27:55.508
Did I really? With Ms.Okudera?

27:55.633 --> 27:57.218
What happened afterwards?

27:58.719 --> 28:00.721
I don't really remember.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.306
Oh really, now?

28:02.765 --> 28:04.892
Coming through.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.728
- Hi guys.
- Hello.

28:08.729 --> 28:10.981
Let's make this a good one.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.234
Right, Taki?

28:22.910 --> 28:26.330
"Mitsuha? Who are you?
What are you?"

28:26.872 --> 28:29.834
You're not touching your boobs today.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.336
Breakfast is ready! Hurry up!

28:35.756 --> 28:37.133
Boobs?

28:39.301 --> 28:40.344
Morning.

28:46.642 --> 28:49.437
Why is everyone staring at me?

28:49.603 --> 28:52.940
Well you made quite a scene yesterday.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.023
Huh?

28:55.234 --> 28:57.110
"Still life drawing"

28:57.111 --> 28:58.255
Did you see the election posters?

28:58.279 --> 29:01.532
Doesn't matter who wins.
It's all about how to serve up the grants.

29:01.657 --> 29:04.785
Shh! Someone's livelihood depends on it.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.122
They mean me, right?

29:08.205 --> 29:09.915
Well, yeah.

29:10.791 --> 29:12.293
Hey, Mitsuha!

29:21.969 --> 29:26.974
Wha...? Wha...? I did what?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.686
Mitsuha?

29:37.777 --> 29:40.446
Is this... Could this be...

29:42.698 --> 29:45.367
Could this be that we're really...

29:45.493 --> 29:47.870
In our dreams, that guy and I are...

29:48.496 --> 29:50.790
In our dreams, that girl and I are...

29:52.291 --> 29:53.459
switching places?

30:27.868 --> 30:31.080
<i>I'm beginning to get what's going on.</i>

30:31.205 --> 30:34.333
<i>Taki is a boy my age living in Tokyo.</i>

30:34.708 --> 30:37.545
<i>I switch with Mitsuha at random,</i>

30:37.670 --> 30:39.588
<i>a few times a week unexpectedly.</i>

30:40.464 --> 30:43.550
<i>Sleep triggers it.
The cause is a mystery.</i>

30:43.551 --> 30:43.926
"Condition: Sleep?
Cause: Unknown"

30:44.051 --> 30:48.764
<i>My memory of the switch is hazy
after I wake up.</i>

30:49.139 --> 30:52.268
<i>But we're definitely switching places.</i>

30:52.560 --> 30:56.272
<i>It's obvious from the reactions
of the people around us.</i> So...

30:56.397 --> 31:01.110
<i>So we laid down some rules
to protect each other's lifestyles.</i>

31:01.235 --> 31:04.153
"No baths! No looking!
No touching!"

31:04.154 --> 31:06.281
<i>Things to Watch out during the switch
and a list of don 'ts. </i>

31:06.282 --> 31:07.532
"Don't waste money! No dialect!
Don't be late!"

31:07.533 --> 31:10.327
<i>We also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones.</i>

31:11.203 --> 31:15.457
<i>To work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon.</i>

31:16.083 --> 31:17.418
But...

31:17.585 --> 31:18.961
But...

31:19.503 --> 31:21.714
- That girl!
- That guy!

31:36.312 --> 31:40.900
<i>Guys are staring! Watch the skirt!
Come on, this is basic!</i>

31:43.986 --> 31:45.905
<i>Stop wasting my money!</i>

31:46.030 --> 31:48.824
<i>It's YOUR body eating.
And I'm working too!</i>

31:48.949 --> 31:50.241
"Braided cords..."

31:50.242 --> 31:50.993
<i>Braided cords... I can't do this!</i>

31:51.118 --> 31:52.953
<i>You work too many shifts!</i>

31:53.078 --> 31:54.622
<i>It's 'cause you waste money!</i>

32:15.017 --> 32:19.313
<i>Grabbed' coffee with Ms. Okudera.
You two have a good thing going!</i>

32:19.480 --> 32:22.858
<i>Mitsuha, stop changing my relationships!</i>

32:23.108 --> 32:26.362
<i>Taki, why is a girl in love with me?</i>

32:26.737 --> 32:29.406
<i>You're more popular when I'm you.</i>

32:29.531 --> 32:32.368
<i>Don't be full of yourself!
Not like YOU have a girlfriend!</i>

32:32.493 --> 32:33.661
<i>You don't have a boyfriend!</i>

32:33.827 --> 32:35.537
"Fool/ldiot"

32:35.663 --> 32:37.581
I'm single because I want to be!

32:59.603 --> 33:01.313
I shouldn't for her sake.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.653
You sure do like your boobs.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.155
We're going now! Get ready!

33:12.950 --> 33:17.371
<i>Comet Tiamat' has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

33:17.454 --> 33:19.164
<i>When and where can it be seen?</i>

33:19.331 --> 33:25.169
"Comet Tiamat to Reach Perigee"

33:25.170 --> 33:25.713
<i>Comet Tiamat is moving from east to west
as if to follow the sun.</i>

33:25.879 --> 33:27.715
<i>So it can be seen above Venus...</i>

33:27.840 --> 33:29.675
Why the uniform?

33:37.641 --> 33:42.646
Grandma, why is the body
of our shrine's god so far away?

33:43.230 --> 33:46.275
I don't know because of Mayugoro.

33:46.734 --> 33:47.735
Who's that?

33:47.860 --> 33:49.194
What? He's famous!

33:57.953 --> 33:59.747
Here, Grandma.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.712
Whoa, Mitsuha.

34:17.806 --> 34:21.726
Mitsuha, Yotsuha, do you know "Musubi"?

34:22.351 --> 34:23.351
Musubi?

34:23.395 --> 34:28.525
Musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god.

34:28.942 --> 34:31.737
This word has profound meaning.

34:32.404 --> 34:37.701
Tying thread is Musubi.
Connecting people is Musubi.

34:37.951 --> 34:40.245
The flow of time is Musubi.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.623
These are all the god's power.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.377
So the braided cords that we make

34:47.585 --> 34:52.925
are the god's art and represent
the flow of time itself.

34:53.842 --> 34:56.261
They converge and take shape.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.514
They twist, tangle

34:59.223 --> 35:03.143
sometimes unravel, break,
then connect again.

35:04.311 --> 35:07.773
Musubi - knotting. That's time.

35:11.151 --> 35:12.319
Drink.

35:12.486 --> 35:13.779
Thank you.

35:14.780 --> 35:15.906
I want some too!

35:16.323 --> 35:18.283
That's also Musubi.

35:19.701 --> 35:22.329
Whether it be water, rice, or <i>sake,</i>

35:22.454 --> 35:27.793
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul, that's Musubi.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.462
So today's offering

35:30.838 --> 35:36.301
is an important custom that
connects the god and people.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.847
Hey, I see it!

35:42.850 --> 35:47.187
That's the body
of Miyamizu Shrine's god?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.583
Beyond this point is "kakuriyo."

36:08.375 --> 36:10.544
It means the underworld.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.046
It's the underworld!

36:16.341 --> 36:20.846
In exchange for returning to this world,
you must leave behind

36:20.971 --> 36:23.223
what is most important to you.

36:25.142 --> 36:27.102
The kuchikamisake.

36:28.228 --> 36:29.605
The kuchikamisake?

36:30.147 --> 36:33.609
You'll offer it inside the god's body.

36:34.026 --> 36:37.404
It's half of you.

36:38.572 --> 36:41.325
<i>Half of Mitsuha...</i>

36:59.051 --> 37:01.303
It's twilight - "kataware-doki" already.

37:01.428 --> 37:03.388
Kataware-doki?

37:13.815 --> 37:14.816
Oh yeah,

37:14.942 --> 37:16.777
maybe I can see the comet.

37:18.111 --> 37:19.780
The comet?

37:20.405 --> 37:21.406
Oh,

37:21.823 --> 37:23.408
Mitsuha,

37:23.617 --> 37:26.912
you're dreaming right now, aren't you?

37:38.298 --> 37:40.801
Tears? Why?

37:43.011 --> 37:45.430
"I'm almost there.
Looking forward to it!"

37:46.139 --> 37:49.434
Ms.Okudera? What's she talking about?

37:50.811 --> 37:52.646
What did Mitsuha do this time?

37:54.398 --> 37:55.440
A date?

38:02.990 --> 38:05.993
<i>A date with Ms.Okudera tomorrow!</i>

38:06.493 --> 38:08.453
<i>Meet at 70:30 a.m. at the station!</i>

38:10.205 --> 38:13.458
Was what I'd planned, but...

38:27.681 --> 38:28.681
Taki.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.560
Sorry. Did you wait long?

38:31.685 --> 38:33.228
Yes. No...

38:33.603 --> 38:35.439
Um...

38:43.864 --> 38:45.198
I just got here.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.492
Good. Let's go.

38:49.244 --> 38:53.081
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

38:57.044 --> 38:58.044
Hey?

39:02.049 --> 39:03.508
I...

39:04.468 --> 39:05.719
Why?

39:12.267 --> 39:14.519
<i>I wanted to go on this date,</i>

39:14.811 --> 39:20.025
<i>but if it so happens that you
end up going, you better enjoy it!</i>

39:24.613 --> 39:29.034
<i>However, I'm sure you've never
gone out on a date before,</i>

39:30.994 --> 39:33.080
I don't know what to say...

39:33.205 --> 39:37.501
<i>so below are some links
to help you out, you late bloomer.</i>

39:37.626 --> 39:38.919
Really?

39:39.294 --> 39:40.534
"You can get a girlfriend too!"

39:42.297 --> 39:45.801
"I suffer anxiety but got a girl!
The dos and don'ts of texting."

39:46.426 --> 39:48.303
She's making fun of me.

39:48.428 --> 39:52.307
"Photo exhibition: Nostalgia"

40:17.290 --> 40:18.333
Taki...

40:19.709 --> 40:22.796
You're like a different person today.

40:33.140 --> 40:37.352
Um, Ms.Okudera. Are you hungry?
How about dinner...

40:39.020 --> 40:40.814
Let's call it a day.

40:42.607 --> 40:43.650
Yes.

40:43.984 --> 40:47.320
Taki, you... Sorry if I'm wrong.

40:48.822 --> 40:52.367
You used to have
a bit of a crush on me, right?

40:53.827 --> 40:56.872
But now you like someone else.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.500
No I don't!

41:00.625 --> 41:01.418
Really?

41:01.543 --> 41:03.879
No! That's not true at all.

41:04.296 --> 41:05.964
I wonder.

41:07.340 --> 41:10.760
Oh well. Thanks for today.
See you at work.

41:25.233 --> 41:30.655
<i>By the time the date is over,
the comet will be visible in the sky.</i>

41:34.075 --> 41:36.369
What is she saying?

41:40.081 --> 41:43.168
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

42:05.065 --> 42:07.192
Oh, it's you, Tessie.

42:08.818 --> 42:13.740
No, I just didn't feel like going,
that's all. I'm fine.

42:14.449 --> 42:18.119
What? The festival? Well...

42:18.245 --> 42:24.167
Oh yeah, the comet. Today's the peak
of its brightness, isn't it?

42:24.834 --> 42:27.712
OK, got it. Later, then.

42:29.839 --> 42:33.093
You just want to see her in ayukata.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.178
What I? No!

42:35.262 --> 42:37.305
That didn't even occur to me.

42:39.349 --> 42:41.434
Hey, she sounded kind of down.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.562
Maybe you annoyed her.

42:43.687 --> 42:44.771
Come on!

42:44.938 --> 42:45.814
Sorry I'm late.

42:45.939 --> 42:47.357
- Here she is!
- Finally!

42:49.025 --> 42:52.779
- Your... your...
- Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

42:53.697 --> 42:55.073
Your hair!

42:56.116 --> 42:58.910
Looks kinda funny, I guess?

43:07.460 --> 43:10.964
You think some guy is the reason?
Ditched, maybe?

43:11.089 --> 43:13.925
Why do guys associate
cutting hair with breakups?

43:14.301 --> 43:16.428
She said she just felt like it.

43:16.553 --> 43:19.973
Really? She just felt like cutting off
that much hair?

43:20.098 --> 43:22.934
Oh! Hey! You can see it!

43:41.494 --> 43:43.538
Wow!

44:01.931 --> 44:07.103
<i>The number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned offi...</i>

44:10.148 --> 44:15.362
<i>I'll tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch,</i>

44:15.487 --> 44:18.239
<i>I thought. But...</i>

44:18.865 --> 44:21.117
<i>For some reason, after that,</i>

44:21.868 --> 44:25.997
<i>Mitsuha and I never
switched places again.</i>

45:01.157 --> 45:04.035
"Mountains in Gifu Prefecture"

45:14.921 --> 45:16.464
"Hida mountains"

46:18.985 --> 46:23.573
What the... What are you doing here?

46:26.326 --> 46:28.953
Tsukasa told me and here I am!

46:32.665 --> 46:38.087
Tsukasa, I asked you to cover for me
at home and at work.

46:38.213 --> 46:39.464
Takagi will cover your shift.

46:39.798 --> 46:42.717
<i>Leave it to me! But you owe me a meal!</i>

46:43.343 --> 46:44.844
This isn't funny.

46:45.011 --> 46:47.263
- We were worried about you.
- Huh?

46:47.388 --> 46:50.517
You can't go alone. What if it's a con act?

46:50.683 --> 46:51.768
A con act?

46:51.893 --> 46:54.062
You're meeting an online friend.

46:54.187 --> 46:56.523
Well no, not exactly...

46:56.689 --> 46:58.858
- I think he's using a dating site.
- No!

46:59.734 --> 47:03.446
You've been acting weird lately.
We'll keep an eye on you.

47:03.571 --> 47:05.240
I'm not a kid!

47:07.534 --> 47:12.080
<i>The switching stopped.
My calls and texts didn't go through.</i>

47:12.747 --> 47:16.751
<i>So I decided to go see Mitsuha
in person.</i>

47:17.544 --> 47:20.004
<i>I wanted to meet her. But...</i>

47:22.340 --> 47:27.554
What? You don't know where?
The town's scenery is your only clue?

47:27.720 --> 47:28.720
Yes.

47:31.432 --> 47:34.894
And you can't contact her?
What's this all about?

47:35.019 --> 47:37.730
Seriously. What a lousy tour planner.

47:37.856 --> 47:39.065
I did not plan a tour!

47:39.190 --> 47:42.527
Oh well. We'll help you look for her.

47:42.652 --> 47:45.697
Oh how cute! Look!

47:45.905 --> 47:46.905
So annoying.

47:46.990 --> 47:49.033
Oh, it moved!

48:17.061 --> 48:19.188
So it's impossible after all...

48:19.314 --> 48:23.067
What? After all the trouble
we went through?

48:25.945 --> 48:28.239
You haven't done anything.

48:31.618 --> 48:33.036
ATakayama ramen.

48:33.161 --> 48:34.579
ATakayama ramen.

48:34.704 --> 48:36.414
Oh, then a Takayama ramen.

48:36.497 --> 48:39.626
- OK. 3 ramens.
- OK.

48:41.794 --> 48:44.172
Can we return to Tokyo today?

48:44.297 --> 48:47.467
We could be cutting it close.
I'll check.

48:47.634 --> 48:48.343
Thanks.

48:48.468 --> 48:50.803
Are you all right with that?

48:53.473 --> 48:57.685
I'm starting to feel like
I'm barking up the wrong tree.

49:01.856 --> 49:05.443
Why young man,
that's Itomori, isn't it?

49:06.819 --> 49:09.989
It's a very good drawing.
Isn't it, dear?

49:11.658 --> 49:15.161
Yeah, it's Itomori.
Brings back memories.

49:15.328 --> 49:17.497
He was born in Itomori.

49:17.664 --> 49:19.082
Itomori...?

49:20.833 --> 49:25.588
Yes! Itomori Town! That's it!
It's nearby, isn't it?

49:25.880 --> 49:28.508
- What are you...
- Itomori was...

49:28.841 --> 49:31.511
Itomori? No way!

49:31.636 --> 49:34.305
Is it where that comet...?

49:42.397 --> 49:45.274
"Keep Out"

50:23.730 --> 50:26.899
Hey. Is this really the place?

50:27.066 --> 50:30.903
No way! Taki must be misremembering.

50:31.237 --> 50:34.699
No. I'm sure this is it.

50:35.158 --> 50:40.413
This schoolyard. The mountains.
I remember this high school clearly!

50:40.580 --> 50:42.331
That can't be true!

50:42.749 --> 50:47.712
Surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago!

50:48.671 --> 50:49.839
Died?

50:51.007 --> 50:54.343
Died 3 years ago?

50:56.304 --> 50:57.597
That can't be.

50:57.847 --> 51:02.185
I still have the memos
that she left behind...

51:19.410 --> 51:21.204
They're disappearing...

51:30.296 --> 51:33.757
Comet Tiamat, with an orbital period
of 1,200 years,

51:33.758 --> 51:36.593
"Itomori,
the Town that Vanished"

51:36.594 --> 51:38.030
made a close approach to Earth
3 years ago in October.

51:38.054 --> 51:41.774
"Meteor Strikes, Wipes out Town" Nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee.

51:43.434 --> 51:44.977
"Town Annihilated"

51:45.311 --> 51:46.729
"Over 500 dead or missing"

51:46.854 --> 51:48.231
"Itomori, the Town that Vanished"

51:49.816 --> 51:53.236
A fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck Japan.

51:53.569 --> 51:56.238
"Itomori, comet, damage"

51:56.239 --> 51:59.492
It was the day of the autumn festival.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.869
The point of impact was here.

52:02.703 --> 52:08.251
At 8:42 p.m., it struck where people
were gathered for the festival.

52:10.378 --> 52:13.755
"List of the Names of Victims"

52:13.756 --> 52:15.916
Over 500 people died,
a third of the town's population,

52:16.467 --> 52:19.512
and now nobody lives in Itomori anymore.

52:28.146 --> 52:31.274
Tessie and Sayaka...

52:32.900 --> 52:37.280
"Mitsuha Miyamizu"

52:37.738 --> 52:42.618
It has to be some kind of mistake.
This person died 3 years ago!

52:42.743 --> 52:48.916
Just 2, 3 weeks ago, she said to me
that the comet would be visible.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.083
So...

52:50.168 --> 52:51.836
<i>You 're dreaming</i> now...

52:52.712 --> 52:53.296
I...

52:53.421 --> 52:55.298
<i>aren't you?</i>

52:56.048 --> 52:57.383
I...

52:59.385 --> 53:00.720
What did I...?

53:14.984 --> 53:16.736
Lively up there.

53:16.903 --> 53:19.447
I'm sorry we could only get one room.

53:19.572 --> 53:20.823
No problem.

53:22.158 --> 53:23.034
How's Taki?

53:23.159 --> 53:26.454
He's still reading articles on Itomori.

53:26.579 --> 53:29.832
Newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems.

53:34.962 --> 53:38.257
- What?
- Nothing. I didn't know you smoked.

53:38.674 --> 53:42.053
Oh. I'd quit recently, but...

53:42.762 --> 53:45.264
What do you think about Taki's story?

53:49.101 --> 53:50.937
I liked him.

53:51.854 --> 53:57.401
The way he was recently. He was always
a nice guy, but even more so lately.

53:58.194 --> 54:01.739
Like he was trying so hard. It was cute.

54:02.823 --> 54:06.869
What he's saying
doesn't make sense to me...

54:09.247 --> 54:14.794
But I'm sure he met someone
and that someone changed him.

54:16.128 --> 54:19.464
That much is for sure, I think.

54:19.465 --> 54:20.825
"Worst-ever
Itomori Comet Disaster"

54:32.853 --> 54:34.897
It was all just a dream.

54:36.649 --> 54:42.571
I recognized the scenery because
I remembered the news from 3 years ago.

54:43.656 --> 54:46.659
If not that, then... a ghost?

54:47.159 --> 54:51.914
No... Was I fantasizing?

54:55.793 --> 54:59.255
Her name... What was it?

55:02.174 --> 55:04.427
Tsukasa went to take a bath.

55:05.052 --> 55:08.431
Oh, Ms.Okudera. I, uh...

55:08.889 --> 55:14.437
I've been saying such strange things.
Thank you for coming along today.

55:24.447 --> 55:25.948
Braided cords. How pretty.

55:26.574 --> 55:29.869
Is that a braided cord you're wearing?

55:30.661 --> 55:35.958
Oh, this... I think someone
gave it to me a long time ago.

55:36.709 --> 55:40.254
I wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm...

55:42.840 --> 55:43.966
Who was it?

55:46.218 --> 55:49.221
Why don't you go take a bath, too?

55:49.388 --> 55:51.265
Yes... No.

55:54.143 --> 55:58.731
Someone who makes braided cords
told me before...

55:58.898 --> 56:01.942
The cords represent
the flow of time itself.

56:02.068 --> 56:08.074
The threads twist, tangle,
unravel, and connect again. That's time...

56:10.326 --> 56:12.286
Maybe at that place...

"Around here?"

without me. I'll return later. Thanks."

Taki...

57:34.368 --> 57:36.328
Eat this up there.

57:37.746 --> 57:41.333
Your drawing of Itomori... It was good.

58:18.913 --> 58:23.709
<i>They converge and take shape.
They twist, tangle,</i>

58:23.834 --> 58:27.379
<i>sometimes unravel,
then connect again...</i>

58:28.506 --> 58:32.885
<i>Musubi - knotting. That's time.</i>

58:43.395 --> 58:44.647
There it is!

58:46.732 --> 58:48.317
It's really there!

58:49.860 --> 58:52.321
It wasn't just a dream!

From here is the underworld.

59:49.128 --> 59:51.839
It's the <i>sake</i> we brought.

59:53.132 --> 59:56.468
This is my sister's, and this is mine.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:05.894
Before the comet struck... So the
Mitsuha I know is from 3 years ago?

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.899
Our timelines weren't in step.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.112
Half of her...

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:30.836
Musubi.

01:00:32.379 --> 01:00:35.049
If time can really be turned back,

01:00:36.342 --> 01:00:38.302
give me one last chance...

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:53.734
The comet!

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:02.094
Your name is Mitsuha.

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.728
You're both my treasures.

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:13.272
You're a big sister now.

01:02:13.439 --> 01:02:15.858
"Get well soon, Mom."

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:18.527
I'm so sorry, my dears.

01:02:20.112 --> 01:02:23.657
Dad, when is Mom going to come home?

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:25.993
I couldn't save her.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:28.036
Get a hold of yourself!

01:02:28.162 --> 01:02:29.413
Who cares about the shrine?

01:02:29.538 --> 01:02:31.206
You're the adopted son-in-law!

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:34.418
I loved my wife Futaba.
Not Miyamizu Shrine.

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:36.003
Get out of here!

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.966
Mitsuha, Yotsuha,

01:02:41.133 --> 01:02:44.636
you'll be with Grandma from now on.

01:02:49.141 --> 01:02:50.349
"Who are you?"
Who am I? No, who are you?

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:51.643
Who am I? No, who are you?

01:02:51.810 --> 01:02:52.728
"Fool"

01:02:52.729 --> 01:02:55.230
Don't be full of yourself.
Not like YOU have a girlfriend.

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:58.984
He's so lucky. They must be together
around now...

01:03:00.486 --> 01:03:01.486
I...

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.821
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.031
What? Hey, Mitsuha!

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:10.662
Grandma, could you do me a favor?

01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:14.124
Oh yeah, the comet.

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:17.836
Today's the peak of its brightness...

01:03:18.086 --> 01:03:19.963
<i>Mitsuha! Don't stay there!</i>

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:25.511
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there
before the comet strikes!</i>

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:30.015
<i>Mitsuha, get out of there!</i>

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:33.143
<i>Mitsuha! Mitsuha!</i>

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.354
<i>Mitsuha!</i>

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:56.667
I'm Mitsuha! She's still alive!

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:09.429
Mitsuha, are you touching...

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:14.101
My sister!

01:04:16.228 --> 01:04:18.355
Yotsuha!

01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.777
Mitsuha has finally lost it.

01:04:24.278 --> 01:04:26.446
I'm leaving without her.

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.032
She's lost it.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.702
She's completely lost it.

01:04:31.827 --> 01:04:33.161
Scary.

01:04:33.287 --> 01:04:37.666
<i>Comet Tiamat' has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now.</i>

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:41.628
<i>Tonight it will finally reach
its perigee around 7:40 p.m.,</i>

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:44.381
<i>and will achieve its maximum brightness.</i>

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.384
It's tonight. There's still time.

01:04:48.093 --> 01:04:49.761
Good morning, Mitsuha.

01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:51.597
Oh...

01:04:52.472 --> 01:04:55.309
You're not Mitsuha, are you?

01:04:56.268 --> 01:04:59.605
You knew, Grandma?

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:06.153
No, but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories.

01:05:07.446 --> 01:05:12.659
I also remember seeing strange dreams
when I was a young girl.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:19.708
Although now I've forgotten about
whose life I was dreaming about.

01:05:20.459 --> 01:05:21.585
Forgotten...

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:26.673
Treasure the experience.
Dreams fade away after you wake up.

01:05:27.299 --> 01:05:31.678
There were times your mother and I
had similar experiences.

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:36.391
Maybe those dreams that
the Miyamizu people had

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:40.145
were all for what will happen today.

01:05:40.562 --> 01:05:42.689
Grandma, listen.

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:48.070
A comet will strike Itomori tonight
and everyone will die.

01:05:55.327 --> 01:06:00.666
<i>"Nobody will believe that"? What a
surprisingly ordinary reply, Grandma.</i>

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:03.502
I won't let them die!

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:07.172
Oh! What happened, Mitsuha?

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:11.593
Your... your hair!

01:06:11.718 --> 01:06:14.262
Oh, this. It looked better before, huh?

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:15.847
Oh, that's it?

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:20.143
Forget that! If nothing is done,
everyone will die tonight!

01:06:22.354 --> 01:06:24.564
So we have to act!

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.071
Why aren't you at school?

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:35.909
Uh... We have to save the town.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:38.736
The community wireless system?

01:06:38.829 --> 01:06:41.331
Yeah, those speakers you see everywhere.

01:06:43.041 --> 01:06:44.835
"Superimposition, frequency"

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:49.881
I see! That could work!
You're awesome, Tessie!

01:06:50.048 --> 01:06:52.509
Hey! Don't come so close!

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:54.720
What, embarrassed? Hey, hey!

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.889
Stop! You're a girl of marriageable age!

01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:00.850
"Club Discontinued - Keep Out"

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:02.519
You're such a nice guy!

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:08.400
Got them. Here's your change.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:09.818
Sorry, Sayaka.

01:07:09.943 --> 01:07:11.319
It's all right.

01:07:11.445 --> 01:07:13.864
- What a cheap fee.
- Deal with it.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:19.828
What about you? Have you come up
with an escape plan?

01:07:23.165 --> 01:07:25.542
What? A bomb?

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:30.213
We have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site.

01:07:30.505 --> 01:07:31.715
Broadcast hijacking?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:37.054
The town's wireless system can be easily
jacked using the start-up frequency.

01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:40.640
So we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school.

01:07:41.433 --> 01:07:45.937
The school is outside the disaster area,
so people can evacuate here.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:49.232
It's... It's totally a crime!

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:50.901
You do the broadcast.

01:07:51.026 --> 01:07:53.612
- Why?
- You're in the broadcast club.

01:07:53.779 --> 01:07:55.405
I'm in charge of explosives.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.616
I'll go talk to the mayor.

01:07:58.158 --> 01:08:01.995
In the end, the city council
has to evacuate everyone.

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.123
I'm his daughter. I can persuade him.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:07.417
It's a perfect plan.

01:08:08.502 --> 01:08:13.173
Oh, whatever. It's just a
what-if fantasy, isn't it?

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:15.634
What? Well...

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.679
Not necessarily! Do you know
how Lake Itomori was formed?

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:23.682
"A meteor crater lake
formed 1,200 years ago."

01:08:23.683 --> 01:08:25.870
It's a meteor crater! So one did strike
this area a thousand years ago!

01:08:25.894 --> 01:08:27.437
Oh! So that's why...

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:29.814
You're right, Tessie!

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.444
Let's do it together!

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:41.952
What on earth are you talking about?

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:47.666
I said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or...

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:48.959
Shut your mouth.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:57.968
"The comet will split and
strike the town"?

01:08:58.093 --> 01:09:00.970
"Itomori Town Hal I"

01:09:01.513 --> 01:09:03.974
How dare you spout such nonsense?

01:09:04.975 --> 01:09:07.560
If you're serious, then you're sick.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.981
Madness must be from the Miyamizu side.

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:16.611
I'll get someone to drive you
to a hospital in the city.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.823
I'll listen to you
after a doctor examines you.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:25.578
You son of a...!

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:37.924
Mitsuha! No...

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.051
Who...

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.180
Who are you?

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.404
See you later at the festival.

01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.281
Let's meet at the shrine.

01:10:01.406 --> 01:10:02.449
- Don't be late.
- Bye!

01:10:02.574 --> 01:10:04.117
- See you.
- Later.

01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:07.120
You shouldn't go!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:10.123
Get out of town. Tell your friends.

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:11.499
What are you saying?

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:12.626
Mitsuha!

01:10:12.751 --> 01:10:15.086
- What was that?
- Let's go.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.589
What are you doing?

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:19.883
Could Mitsuha...

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:23.637
Could she have persuaded them?
Is it my fault?

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:27.891
Yotsuha, leave town with Grandma
before nightfall.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.935
You'll die if you stay here!

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:31.978
What are you saying?

01:10:32.103 --> 01:10:36.524
Yesterday you suddenly went to Tokyo.
What's wrong with you?

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.611
Tokyo?

01:10:39.819 --> 01:10:42.572
Hey, Mitsuha!

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:46.910
How did it go with your old man?

01:10:49.037 --> 01:10:50.705
Hey, Mitsuha?

01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:52.540
What's wrong with her?

01:10:52.666 --> 01:10:53.792
No idea.

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:05.512
Are you there?

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:08.932
Is something over there?

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.600
Let me use your bike.

01:11:10.725 --> 01:11:11.726
Hey, what the...

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.061
Hey, Mitsuha!

01:11:14.312 --> 01:11:15.647
What about our plan?

01:11:15.814 --> 01:11:17.649
Get ready as planned!

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:19.693
Please!

01:11:45.468 --> 01:11:48.179
I'm Taki again.

01:11:51.558 --> 01:11:54.519
What's Taki doing here?

01:12:03.528 --> 01:12:04.528
The town...

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:06.656
is gone.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:19.878
At that moment... did I...

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:24.841
die?

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:37.228
<i>Taki. Taki.</i>

01:12:40.065 --> 01:12:41.733
<i>Don't you remember me?</i>

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:56.331
I'm going to Tokyo.

01:12:56.456 --> 01:12:57.749
What? Now?

01:12:58.166 --> 01:12:59.250
Why?

01:12:59.751 --> 01:13:00.752
A date.

01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:03.088
You have a boyfriend in Tokyo?

01:13:03.213 --> 01:13:05.131
Not my date.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.426
I'll come home tonight.

01:13:11.304 --> 01:13:16.267
<i>If I suddenly showed up,
would I bother him? Surprise him?</i>

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:18.978
<i>He might not like it.</i>

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:30.824
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

01:13:30.949 --> 01:13:32.909
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.286
<i>But what if we did?</i>

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:40.291
<i>What should I do? Would I annoy him?
Would it be awkward?</i>

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.294
"Tiamat Makes Closest Approach Tomorrow"

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:47.215
<i>he'd be a bit glad to see me?</i>

01:13:48.133 --> 01:13:52.303
<i>The number you are trying to call
is not reachable...</i>

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:55.223
<i>There's no way we could meet.</i>

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:57.892
But...

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.813
<i>one thing is certain.</i>

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:06.651
<i>If we see each other, we'll know.</i>

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:10.738
<i>That you were the one who was inside me.</i>

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:14.659
<i>That I was the one who was inside you.</i>

01:14:14.826 --> 01:14:16.494
I'm sorry.

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:48.860
Excuse me.

01:15:21.392 --> 01:15:25.396
<i>That time 3 years ago,
before I got to know you...</i>

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:30.401
Taki.

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:32.904
Taki.

01:15:34.906 --> 01:15:35.990
Taki.

01:15:37.325 --> 01:15:39.160
Um... It's me.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.748
Don't you remember me?

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.417
Who are you?

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:52.590
I'm sorry.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:01.933
<i>But he's Taki.</i>

01:16:03.226 --> 01:16:04.936
<i>Weird girl.</i>

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:14.861
Hey!

01:16:16.114 --> 01:16:17.323
What's your name?

01:16:18.074 --> 01:16:19.074
Mitsuha!

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.953
My name is Mitsuha!

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:34.215
<i>That time 3 years ago, you came...</i>

01:16:34.799 --> 01:16:36.426
<i>to see me!</i>

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:48.646
Taki?

01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:59.073
Mitsuha!

01:17:00.325 --> 01:17:01.618
Taki?

01:17:16.049 --> 01:17:17.800
Mitsuha!

01:17:18.051 --> 01:17:21.804
You're here, aren't you? Inside my body!

01:17:22.347 --> 01:17:23.973
Taki!

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.476
Taki, where are you?

01:17:27.226 --> 01:17:28.519
It's Mitsuha.

01:17:28.853 --> 01:17:30.772
I can hear her, but...

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:34.859
Taki, where are you?

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:36.068
Taki!

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:51.376
Taki, are you...

01:17:52.919 --> 01:17:54.170
there?

01:18:19.112 --> 01:18:20.863
It's twilight - "kataware-doki."

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:36.920
Mitsuha.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:44.554
Taki.

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:49.350
Taki. It's really you.

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:54.605
Taki!

01:18:54.731 --> 01:18:56.899
I came to see you.

01:18:57.275 --> 01:19:01.237
It wasn't easy because
you were so far away.

01:19:01.362 --> 01:19:06.117
But how? At that moment, <i>I...</i>

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.661
I drank your kuchikamisake.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.625
You drank that?

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.128
You idiot! Pervert!

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.215
Oh yeah, and you touched my boobs!

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.301
How do you know that?

01:19:23.426 --> 01:19:25.052
Yotsuha saw it.

01:19:25.178 --> 01:19:28.890
Oh! Sorry, I couldn't help it!
It was just once.

01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:30.433
Just once?

01:19:32.727 --> 01:19:34.395
Doesn't matter how many times! Jerk.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.439
Sorry.

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:38.941
Oh, this...

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:43.446
Oh. Really, Why'd you come see me
before I knew you?
