so l'm saying it was on the front seat.

05:24.453 --> 05:30.130
-What about DiSalvo, he any trouble?
-No, but he knew what was going on.

05:30.293 --> 05:34.411
This can go away. l write it up in the
door pocket, l'd lose in court anyway.

05:34.573 --> 05:39.124
Let me talk to this guy.
l'll find you in a couple of minutes.

05:39.293 --> 05:43.047
-Yeah, sarge is gonna want to know.
-All right, thanks.

06:10.773 --> 06:13.810
-Let's deal with the situation.
-He didn't know, believe me.

there were drugs.

-Tommy.

06:18.373 --> 06:22.446
Tommy, exactly, and we get
pulled over for a busted taillight.

06:22.613 --> 06:26.401
-There's coke in the side pocket.
-Nothing, man, recreational.

06:26.573 --> 06:28.325

of years, l'm not gonna screw up now.

06:44.053 --> 06:45.486
All right.

06:45.853 --> 06:48.367
Why don't we see what we
can do to make this go away?

06:48.533 --> 06:53.288
-Tommy, what did l say about this guy?
-Cop said you had an attitude problem.

06:53.453 --> 06:59.244
Sorry, l lost my temper on that cop.
Believe me, l'm feeling bad about it.

06:59.413 --> 07:03.167
lt could go away because of confusion
as to where the drugs were found.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.164
Could be an illegal search,
l was saying.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.413
l'm not saying it was an illegal search.
l'm saying there's some confusion.

07:08.413 --> 07:09.289
l'm not saying it was an illegal search.
l'm saying there's some confusion.

07:09.453 --> 07:10.681
Right, understood.

07:10.853 --> 07:14.528
They may vouch that the coke
was found property and let you go.

07:14.693 --> 07:16.524

07:16.693 --> 07:19.924

and destabilize cellulite deposits.

-Uh-huh.
-ls that what you think?

08:53.973 --> 08:55.326
Yes, it is.

He worked the Fulton Mall a couple
years ago. A buddy of mine told me.

09:20.693 --> 09:26.325
They could never get enough to hold
him. Every plain Jane's gonna be here.

Long as l'm the zone commander,
l want you to know what to expect.

09:41.453 --> 09:42.852
-That's good.
-Two things.

09:43.013 --> 09:47.333
One: l believe in open dialogue.
Two: l judge a man on his performance.

09:47.333 --> 09:48.402
One: l believe in open dialogue.
Two: l judge a man on his performance.

09:48.573 --> 09:53.601
lf that's a departure from Haverill's
approach, so be it. On overtime--

09:53.773 --> 09:57.561
-l wanna approve overtime in advance.
-That's gonna make for a lot of calls.

09:57.733 --> 10:02.284

chance to know the work of the squad.

10:03.653 --> 10:06.884

26:17.773 --> 26:19.604
Every detective should be competent.

26:19.773 --> 26:23.561
Nice theory, but this isn't a patrol
where assignments are interchangeable.

26:23.733 --> 26:27.567
Truth is, the guys on night watch don't
catch cases. lt's a custodial shift.

26:27.733 --> 26:30.531
Guys work cases till they're
done with or without overtime.

26:30.693 --> 26:32.809
We're gonna come out
all right on this?

26:32.973 --> 26:34.486
l don't know, captain.

26:41.773 --> 26:44.446
Excuse me,
could l speak to a detective?

26:44.613 --> 26:46.693
Sure. Just a sec,
wait right there.

26:46.693 --> 26:48.888
Sure. Just a sec,
wait right there.

26:49.413 --> 26:53.247
Detective, there's another one
of those ladies here.

26:55.733 --> 26:56.927
LESNlAK:
Can l help you?

26:57.093 --> 26:59.402
l don't know. l just
have some questions.

26:59.573 --> 27:00.722
ln regards to this box?

27:00.893 --> 27:03.407
-Are you familiar with this?
-lt's a bogus product.

27:03.853 --> 27:06.925
The man who sold it to me
seemed so nice.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.607
l'm gonna shut this guy down.
Miss. . .?

27:09.773 --> 27:11.604
-Brenda.
LESNlAK: Want to have a seat?

27:25.133 --> 27:26.964
Look at this cocky prick.

27:38.813 --> 27:39.802
You guys again.

27:39.973 --> 27:42.612
-We need to talk to you.
-l got nothing more to tell you.

27:42.773 --> 27:45.810
-You see, you just think that.
-We are investigating a homicide.

27:45.973 --> 27:50.888
We need to be sure about Cobb's
whereabouts yesterday. You understand?

27:51.053 --> 27:55.569
Look, the guy shows up, he punches
in. He's here working on vehicles.

27:55.733 --> 27:59.328
Once in a blue moon, he takes one for
a drive, which lasts about 1 0 minutes.

27:59.493 --> 28:03.247
-l told you this. l saw him all day.
-That's crap.

28:07.653 --> 28:10.850
-This is not mine.
-You're half loaded every day. . .

28:11.013 --> 28:14.130
. . .and you wouldn't know where this
guy was from one hour to the next.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.649
You think you're gonna protect
your fat-ass job alibiing this guy?

28:17.813 --> 28:19.371
You're gonna lose your job.

28:19.533 --> 28:22.969
l will take this bottle to your
commissioner and put it on his desk.

28:23.133 --> 28:26.887
SlMONE: How long you been on
the job, Supervisor Kosyck?

28:28.053 --> 28:33.207
-Nineteen years.
-You ready to sacrifice that for this bum?

28:36.213 --> 28:40.491
Okay. Maybe there's stretches
where l don't see him every minute.

28:40.893 --> 28:42.884
How long do these ''stretches'' last?

28:43.173 --> 28:45.733
An hour, maybe more. l don't
keep track of time so good.

28:46.173 --> 28:48.448
Funny how that happens.

28:48.613 --> 28:50.444
-The murder was in Manhattan?
-Right.

28:50.613 --> 28:53.446
lf he took our truck, they'd have
a record on the Triborough.

28:53.613 --> 28:56.525
They go over on a pass, coming and
going, they'd have the time.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.923
Don't you tell that
asshole what you told us.

28:59.213 --> 29:01.886
No, l won't say anything.

29:18.053 --> 29:20.806
Detective Simone.
Can l talk to you?

29:21.013 --> 29:22.844
-How are you?
-ls it true you let him go?

29:23.013 --> 29:25.163
That you had Derrick Cobb
and you let him go?

29:25.333 --> 29:27.563
There was confusion,
we weren't able to hold him.

29:27.853 --> 29:31.243
Well, he called me to
gloat. He was laughing.

29:31.413 --> 29:32.448
He called you?

29:32.613 --> 29:35.685
After you let him go. What is it?
Didn't you believe me?

29:35.853 --> 29:41.166
Did you think l was making this up?
Why would l make this up?

29:41.333 --> 29:43.449
That wasn't it, Mrs. Cantwell.

29:44.213 --> 29:45.805
Mrs. Cantwell.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.769
We developed evidence showing that
he was lying about his whereabouts.

29:49.933 --> 29:54.211
We'll get a warrant, search for proof.
He's not gonna get away with this.

29:56.853 --> 29:58.923
Do you have children?

29:59.453 --> 30:00.681
l do.

30:02.093 --> 30:03.811
Oh.

30:05.533 --> 30:08.172
Well, then, that's all right.

30:08.853 --> 30:11.651
That's all right, then. l'm--

30:12.413 --> 30:14.768
That'll help me.

30:14.933 --> 30:19.484
You go home now, and l'll notify
you the minute something develops.

30:20.773 --> 30:23.162
lf you call. . .

30:23.333 --> 30:29.602
. . .could you please ring once
and then call back so l know it's you?

30:30.293 --> 30:33.683
l can't stand to hear
his voice anymore.

30:39.853 --> 30:41.206
RAY:
Hey, Bobby.

30:41.533 --> 30:42.761
Hey, Ray.

30:42.933 --> 30:45.493
-l gotta talk to this guy.
-l'll tell Fancy what we got.

30:45.653 --> 30:48.292
-See about getting the search warrant.
-All right.

30:48.453 --> 30:51.525
Let's go down here, come on.

30:58.573 --> 31:01.133
This looks serious.

31:01.893 --> 31:04.088
SlMONE: Ray, l have to talk to you
about the club.

31:04.253 --> 31:06.448
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah, it was great.

31:06.613 --> 31:10.606
l don't think it's such a good
idea for you to be involved there.

31:10.773 --> 31:13.048
Due respect, Bobby.
We've had this conversation.

31:13.213 --> 31:16.444
-Your concern is with the clientele?
-This is a different conversation.

31:16.933 --> 31:18.605
Different, how?

31:19.253 --> 31:23.132
l'm saying l've got a bad feeling, and
l don't think you should be involved.

31:23.653 --> 31:27.009
-Meaning what? ls the place hot?
-Ray, it means what it means.

31:27.693 --> 31:30.765
l hope if there was something
coming up, you'd let me know.

31:30.933 --> 31:33.003
No, don't go counting
on anything like that.

31:33.173 --> 31:37.132
l am telling you as a cop and as a
friend, that you are over your head. . .

31:37.293 --> 31:41.809
. . .and if you're smart, you'd straighten
out. That's the last l'm saying it.

31:42.013 --> 31:44.402
Okay, okay.

31:47.933 --> 31:51.482
Bobby, what are your intentions
with Benita from the other night?

31:51.653 --> 31:53.848
We're working it out right now.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.050
-She's a great dancer, kid.
-Pay attention to what l'm saying.

31:57.213 --> 32:01.172
You want to be a wiseguy, then be a
wiseguy. Don't be some half-wiseguy.

32:01.333 --> 32:04.086
Don't come crying
if this thing blows up.

32:14.213 --> 32:17.285
DERRlCK: l want my lawyer.
-You get one when they arraign you.

32:17.453 --> 32:20.092
We don't need a statement,
so you don't need a lawyer.

32:20.253 --> 32:22.050
We'll book you
and send you to the Tombs.

32:22.213 --> 32:23.726
You're as stupid as you are sick.

32:23.893 --> 32:25.963
-That wasn't my knife.
SlMONE: Oh, no.

32:26.133 --> 32:29.682
lt was under the seat of the truck you
signed out with blood all over it.

32:29.853 --> 32:31.730
l know why you kept it, Derrick.

32:31.893 --> 32:34.407
You could've thrown her off
the bridge and beaten this.

32:34.693 --> 32:39.323
But the twisted bastard that you are,
you wanted to show it to her mother.

32:42.573 --> 32:44.928
-Did it go down?
-Had the knife hidden in the truck.

32:45.093 --> 32:46.924
With that moron moustache
he was wearing.

32:47.093 --> 32:48.606
-What did she say?
-Shut up, Cobb.

32:48.773 --> 32:51.367
-What did she say when you told her?
SlPOWlCZ: Shut up.

32:51.533 --> 32:54.730
Shut your mouth
or l'll break your jaw. Shut up!

32:55.613 --> 32:57.126
-ls that the guy?
-Yeah.

32:57.413 --> 32:58.687
Can l speak to you guys?

32:58.853 --> 33:01.321
-James, keep an eye on the prisoner.
MARTlNEZ: Okay.

33:01.493 --> 33:02.528
Bobby, Andy.

33:02.693 --> 33:04.604
MARTlNEZ: l got it.
-Could you come here?

33:12.653 --> 33:15.690
SlMONE: Captain?
-Congratulations. lmpressive work.

33:15.853 --> 33:17.650
-Thanks.
BASS: l'm just learning my job.

33:17.813 --> 33:20.088
l made a bad call and
you guys bailed me out.

33:20.413 --> 33:23.723
You can get drummed out of the
boss's union, apologizing like that.

33:23.893 --> 33:27.966
You know, processing that arrest
is gonna involve overtime.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.532
Approved.

33:34.693 --> 33:37.651
That guy shows me a little something.

33:40.253 --> 33:43.051
With all due respect,
don't you think this is insane?

33:43.213 --> 33:47.252
No, $600 in unpaid parking violations
guarantees you a court appearance.

33:47.413 --> 33:50.928
-l said l'll pay it right now.
-A detective will take your statement.

33:51.093 --> 33:55.484
-How come you're not locking him up?
-He's not in on a fraud charge.

33:55.653 --> 33:59.248
-Any word from my lawyer?
-Yeah, l'm on my way.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.483
You believe these assholes?

34:06.653 --> 34:11.886
l take a beating from these
half-wit apes and l end up in a cage.

34:12.053 --> 34:13.532
Do l look interested?

34:13.813 --> 34:16.646
Excuse me for drawing breath.

34:17.572 --> 34:19.005
Okay, how'd it happen?

34:19.172 --> 34:22.529
l sold these guys
a winning lotto ticket, right?

34:22.693 --> 34:26.686
l couldn't cash it because of
certain tax problems, right? Anyway. . . .

34:27.013 --> 34:30.369
-lt turns out that there's defacement.
-Yeah, the date's been changed?

34:30.533 --> 34:35.732
The lotto people won't honor it,
so these guys give me a beating.

34:35.893 --> 34:38.804
-They should beat up Governor Pataki.
-Who are you kidding, pal?

34:38.973 --> 34:42.248
-What do you mean, who am l kidding?
-You phonied a winning ticket.

34:42.413 --> 34:46.485
The guys you sold it to caught on,
kicked your ass, and got you busted.

34:46.933 --> 34:52.166
-You got a nasty turn of mind.
-Yeah, that's how l came out.

34:53.293 --> 34:56.012
-You ever hear of the black box?
-Excuse me?

34:56.293 --> 34:58.284
Let me ask you something.

34:58.733 --> 35:01.964
For the right amount of money,
could you make it with an ugly woman?

35:02.133 --> 35:04.806
MEDAVO Y:
What, do her, you mean?

35:04.973 --> 35:07.965
-Sexually?
-Romantically, sexually sometimes.

35:08.133 --> 35:13.287
-Any port in a storm, l guess.
-You want to sell beauty enhancements.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.961
-You gonna make bail?
-Should be out in a few hours.

35:16.133 --> 35:19.011
-What are you in on?
-A hummer, parking tickets. You--

35:19.173 --> 35:20.686
You got a few dollars to invest?

35:20.933 --> 35:24.892
-This black box, it's a beauty aid?
-No, it's a prop.

35:25.053 --> 35:29.046
You gotta dress it. l could put them
together and show you the pitch.

35:29.213 --> 35:32.762
-Sell you, like, a franchise.
-Where do you work it?

35:32.933 --> 35:36.721
Restaurants, movies, catch an
ugly broad with her guard down.

35:36.893 --> 35:40.249
When you get a qualifier,
you gotta get next to her.

35:41.093 --> 35:44.881
-Then you sell them the black box?
-Tell them it destabilizes cellulite.

35:45.053 --> 35:48.887
-Whatever the hell that means.
-You sleep with these women?

35:49.053 --> 35:52.728
As seldom as possible. Unfortunately,
l had to do a couple this week.

35:52.893 --> 35:54.733
An unhappy, unloved woman is the
most desperate thing in the world.

35:54.733 --> 35:56.883
An unhappy, unloved woman is the
most desperate thing in the world.

35:57.053 --> 35:59.408
Especially if she's a beast.

36:01.413 --> 36:04.371
lf it gets that bad you can turn
her face-down, you know?

36:04.533 --> 36:06.285
l'll sign that complaint now.

36:06.453 --> 36:08.842
MEDAVO Y: What kind of money?
-Yes, so will l.

36:09.013 --> 36:13.131
lt'll cost you a few bucks, but
you're gonna make a pile, my friend.

36:21.013 --> 36:24.847
l'm gonna like closing the cell door
on him, wipe that smirk off his face.

36:25.013 --> 36:28.210
That's not gonna happen,
he's one evil son of a bitch.

36:29.453 --> 36:31.444
Mrs. Cantwell, what
are you doing here?

36:31.613 --> 36:34.332
You notified me
that he was in custody.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.609
We gave you a call.

36:36.773 --> 36:39.287
Where is he? ls he here?

36:39.453 --> 36:42.092
He is here, isn't he?

36:42.253 --> 36:44.972
Why don't you come
in the back and talk with me?

36:45.133 --> 36:47.886
l want to see him.
l have a right to see him.

36:48.053 --> 36:49.850
SlMONE:
l don't think that's a good idea.

36:50.213 --> 36:53.364
AGNES:
He'll see me, just ask him.

36:53.533 --> 36:57.287
Seeing me like this will
just make his day.

36:57.453 --> 37:00.411
-Can l see your bag, please?
-No.

37:00.573 --> 37:02.723
You cannot see my bag.

37:03.493 --> 37:06.849
What do you have in your bag?
ls there a weapon in there?

37:07.213 --> 37:10.091
-l don't know what you mean.
-You have something in that bag.

37:10.253 --> 37:13.404
Now, do not do this.
Do not let this man win.

37:13.853 --> 37:16.162
He has already won.

37:16.773 --> 37:18.764
My daughter is dead.

37:18.933 --> 37:22.084
l know that this man has taken
a great deal from you, l know that.

37:22.413 --> 37:25.246
lf l don't do it to him,
l will do it to myself!

37:25.413 --> 37:28.530
Don't do that. ls that
gonna help your daughter?

37:28.893 --> 37:31.453
Would your daughter want you to die?

37:31.613 --> 37:33.285
My daughter?

37:34.733 --> 37:36.803
My daughter.

37:40.093 --> 37:42.926
You didn't know her. But she--

37:43.653 --> 37:46.565
She was so beautiful.

37:46.733 --> 37:50.408
She was the kindest person
that l've ever known.

37:50.573 --> 37:54.805
She was the one
thing that l did right.

37:55.453 --> 37:57.842
And then l let this man
into our lives.

37:58.013 --> 38:00.402
You are not responsible for this.

38:00.973 --> 38:03.726
You didn't know what kind
of person this man was.

38:03.893 --> 38:06.930
We can't always know what's
in another person's heart.

38:10.373 --> 38:13.683
Mrs. Cantwell,
please give me that gun.

38:31.133 --> 38:33.966
Now l have to live.

38:37.533 --> 38:39.728
l don't know how.

38:41.373 --> 38:44.649
l don't know how l'm gonna do that.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.127
What are you gonna do
with the piece?

39:10.293 --> 39:12.807
l'm gonna feed it to the
eels in the East River.

39:12.973 --> 39:16.682
-Detective Simone, line two.
-Yeah.

39:21.093 --> 39:23.926
Hello, Simone. Uh-huh.

39:26.733 --> 39:28.485
Uh-huh.

39:29.893 --> 39:31.531
Okay, thank you.

39:32.653 --> 39:35.326
l gotta do something. Andy. . .

39:35.493 --> 39:38.803
. . .can you take care of this for me?

39:40.373 --> 39:42.728
You got a favorite pier?

40:06.173 --> 40:07.492
Bobby.

40:13.733 --> 40:16.372
Some mess here, huh, Ray?

40:17.333 --> 40:22.851
l don't know anything, Bobby. l was
security, l wasn't one of the players.

40:23.693 --> 40:26.207
l don't want to go to jail, Bobby.
Can you fix this?

40:26.413 --> 40:27.641
No, l can't, Ray.

40:27.973 --> 40:31.602
This is the first time l was involved
in anything like this, you know that.

40:31.773 --> 40:34.367
-Just tell them--
-Ray. Talk to your lawyer.

40:34.533 --> 40:37.172
l'm not talking to my lawyer, Bobby.
l'm talking to you.

40:37.333 --> 40:38.846
My lawyer?

40:39.013 --> 40:41.766
What's my lawyer know?
Some kid telling me to cut a deal--

40:41.933 --> 40:45.846
lf that's what they're saying,
then that's what you should do.

40:47.933 --> 40:50.527
You're just gonna walk out on me?

40:51.053 --> 40:52.805
-l thought we were friends, Bobby.
-Ray.

40:52.973 --> 40:54.884
l cannot help you now.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.408
l could've helped you before,
l tried to help.

40:57.573 --> 40:58.767
-You didn't.
-l warned you.

40:58.933 --> 41:03.688
-You didn't warn me, Bobby.
-l did everything but give you a time.

41:03.853 --> 41:07.289
That's what l needed, see?
How was l supposed to believe you?

41:07.613 --> 41:11.288
lf you had told me the exact time,
l would've believed you.

41:11.453 --> 41:13.011
Forget it, man.

41:14.093 --> 41:15.492
Come on, Bobby.

41:16.733 --> 41:18.325
You see my point, right?

41:18.493 --> 41:22.281
l'm basically a good person,
you know that.

41:24.133 --> 41:26.806
l just needed some guidance there.

41:26.973 --> 41:30.682
And you weren't quite as specific
as you could've been.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.882
That's all l'm saying.

41:36.613 --> 41:38.410
l'm a good person.

41:38.933 --> 41:41.288
-l just needed some guidance.
-You made a mistake.

41:41.453 --> 41:44.968
l made a mistake,
but that doesn't mean l belong here.

41:47.173 --> 41:49.050
Can't you do anything for me, Bobby?

41:51.693 --> 41:54.048
Take care of yourself, Ray.

BENlTA:
What's wrong?

42:32.773 --> 42:34.092
SlMONE:
Nothing.

42:40.733 --> 42:42.132
Nothing.

42:45.333 --> 42:46.846
l'm sorry.

42:59.573 --> 43:02.041
Upset about your friend?

43:02.293 --> 43:03.567
Yeah.

43:10.493 --> 43:13.451
You know, this guy was a hero
to me when l was growing up.

43:13.613 --> 43:14.966
BENlTA:
Really?

43:16.333 --> 43:18.608
Yeah, he was. He was. . . .

43:21.613 --> 43:24.081
The boy was cool.

43:26.293 --> 43:30.206
Just walking on the street,
you couldn't take your eyes off him.

43:31.453 --> 43:37.005
l'm, like, 1 0 years old and he's 1 6.
l'm following him like a puppy.

43:37.413 --> 43:41.201
But he always had time for me.

43:43.253 --> 43:45.721
He never talked down to me.

43:51.573 --> 43:54.531
Seeing him at the Tombs like that,
that was tough.

43:55.373 --> 43:57.170
That was tough.

43:58.613 --> 44:05.007
l don't mean it harsh, but he seemed, at
that club, like another wiseguy wannabe.

44:07.053 --> 44:08.930
Hmm.

44:10.533 --> 44:13.764
Well, l guess that is what
he seems like now.

44:15.333 --> 44:17.210
l guess you had to know him younger.

44:17.373 --> 44:18.408
Yeah.

44:23.293 --> 44:24.612
Yeah.

44:26.133 --> 44:29.284
Nothing's what you thought
when you were younger.

44:35.453 --> 44:38.286
lt's like James Brown says:

44:39.093 --> 44:43.371
''Money won't change you,
but time will take you on. ''
