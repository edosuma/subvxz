WEBVTT

00:00.840 --> 00:02.588
Greetings and salutations.

00:02.718 --> 00:04.150
I'm sorry we can't meet face-to-face,

00:04.280 --> 00:06.163
but I do understand why.

00:06.298 --> 00:08.010
Now if you're looking
for top-notch security,

00:08.138 --> 00:10.318
there ain't a notch above
my team here at Contra.

00:10.446 --> 00:13.482
Banks, armored cars...
We break in and test your security

00:13.617 --> 00:16.474
before the bad guys can.
There's Melanie Garcia,

00:16.600 --> 00:18.961
first-rate lock picker
and surveillance expert.

00:19.102 --> 00:19.876
Target's on the move.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.951
We've got one shot at this job,
and failure is not an option.

00:23.085 --> 00:25.540
Cameron Price-slickest
hacker on the West Coast.

00:25.685 --> 00:28.355
I got this.
And we're in the city's traffic grid.

00:28.489 --> 00:29.883
Josh, you're good to go.

00:30.020 --> 00:32.350
Josh Armstrong, our master of disguise.

00:32.494 --> 00:33.555
Detouring the truck now.

00:33.785 --> 00:36.146
Now! Now, Cash! 
Now! Go!

00:38.970 --> 00:41.049
And there's Cash, our gadget man.

00:41.184 --> 00:42.995
The rabbit's in the trap!
It's either now or never!

00:44.048 --> 00:45.092
You ready? 
Let's do this.

00:45.225 --> 00:48.255
I assure you there's no
better crew in the business.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.525
What the hell are you doing?!
We're gonna need one order

00:51.680 --> 00:53.348
of your delicious onion rings, stat!

00:53.486 --> 00:56.306
Come on! We need them now!
Fry like the wind, woman!

00:56.437 --> 00:59.190
And the best part is... here's your lunch

00:59.315 --> 01:02.405
my team will do anything I tell them.

01:02.605 --> 01:12.805
== ReSync by <font color=#00FF00>jacobian</font> ==
== for 720p Web-DL @<font color=#00FFFF>hdbits.org</font> ==

01:23.788 --> 01:25.294
Okay, work time.

01:25.437 --> 01:27.706
Now this morning, while you guys
were out fiddling your diddles,

01:27.848 --> 01:29.718
I landed us a cush new gig.
We've been hired

01:29.873 --> 01:32.900
by some rich, crazy old lady
to test her home security.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.446
There's a safe inside her living room.

01:34.582 --> 01:36.324
She wants to see if you guys can break in,

01:36.470 --> 01:38.735
crack it, and get out.
The suburbs?

01:38.882 --> 01:40.937
Don't we, like, do more
high-tech stuff here?

01:41.061 --> 01:44.718
I gotta agree, Oz.
Robbing an old lady's child's play.

01:44.847 --> 01:48.345
Trust me. I know. Thanks.
Enjoy the cookies...

01:49.281 --> 01:50.970
While I enjoy your purse.

01:51.227 --> 01:52.904
You know, your childhood sounds fun.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.633
Mine was ravaged by scoliosis.
Okay, enough chitchat.

01:56.764 --> 01:59.572
I want this job handled pronto.
Melanie, you're in charge.

01:59.696 --> 02:03.331
Uh, yeah, but I still haven't
closed that bank job,

02:03.461 --> 02:05.860
so can't we please find another lead?

02:05.994 --> 02:07.394
I can do it. I - I don't mind.

02:07.533 --> 02:11.760
I mean, I-if it'll make your
life easier or whatever.

02:11.990 --> 02:14.788
Oh, the new guy stepping up- me likey!

02:15.127 --> 02:18.724
I knight thee "Team Leader."
There can be only one.

02:18.862 --> 02:20.156
Is that "Highlander"?

02:20.296 --> 02:22.852
Yes, it is, and so is this sword.

02:22.993 --> 02:25.647
I won it off Sir Sean Connery
in a heated game of beer pong.

02:25.788 --> 02:27.953
Instead of beer, we used scotch.
Instead of pong,

02:28.086 --> 02:31.059
we used rifles, so I guess we
sort of played scotch rifles.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.284
That's beside the point.
I want this job handled A.S.A.P.

02:34.418 --> 02:37.063
No questions. 
Why so secretive?

02:37.582 --> 02:40.787
I-I know, but who's the old lady?
Fine, but at least tell us

02:40.928 --> 02:43.672
what's in the safe. 
Any carnival psychic

02:43.806 --> 02:46.224
could come up with generic
sentences like that.

02:49.889 --> 02:51.700
Oh, and, Cameron...

02:58.500 --> 03:00.483
Hey, thank you for volunteering.

03:00.626 --> 03:02.605
Seriously, you just made
my life way easier.

03:02.735 --> 03:04.252
Ah, least I could do.

03:09.112 --> 03:12.374
How does he know what we're saying?
Yeah, Oz reads lips.

03:12.507 --> 03:13.692
Of course he does.

03:15.342 --> 03:16.674
Have a seat, cupcake.

03:16.855 --> 03:18.617
Just wanna make sure my trusted team leader

03:18.732 --> 03:20.869
took the job for all the right reasons.

03:21.051 --> 03:23.140
Yeah, figured it was an easy job,

03:23.263 --> 03:25.150
might as well get another
"W" under my belt.

03:25.278 --> 03:26.930
That "W" stand for "whipped"?

03:27.047 --> 03:29.024
Whipped? By Melanie?

03:29.224 --> 03:30.341
Hilarious.

03:31.356 --> 03:33.680
Thanks for dogsitting Charlie this weekend.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.099
Least I could do.

03:36.898 --> 03:38.673
And he's done.

03:40.333 --> 03:43.639
It's none of your business.
Your business is my business.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.277
You're my star hacker. I need you focused.

03:46.583 --> 03:48.287
Don't get involved with difficult women.

03:48.428 --> 03:49.946
It won't end well. Trust me.

03:50.082 --> 03:53.263
I've dated some daffy doozies in my day.
But you're not me,

03:53.421 --> 03:55.709
so I'm gonna solve your
little Melanie situation

03:55.829 --> 03:57.877
with a little patented Oz wisdom.

03:58.022 --> 03:59.679
Move on, muchacho!

03:59.829 --> 04:02.804
She's too much woman for you,
and she has a boyfriend.

04:02.930 --> 04:05.646
Who happens to be a sketchy mega douche.

04:05.778 --> 04:06.964
Melly bean!

04:07.581 --> 04:10.328
Dutch! Hey.

04:11.119 --> 04:14.157
Something wrong?
Yeah, something's wrong.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.125
I forgot to kiss you good-bye this morning.

04:17.264 --> 04:19.312
I can't start my day without it.

04:23.565 --> 04:24.745
Oh, my God.

04:24.877 --> 04:27.064
Wow. You are boned.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.984
Our target-2358 James Drive.

04:35.117 --> 04:38.073
Here's the plan.
It's real complicated stuff.

04:38.187 --> 04:39.720
Our entry point will be...

04:41.112 --> 04:42.264
The door.

04:42.922 --> 04:44.269
Mel will crack the old lady's safe,

04:44.418 --> 04:46.247
Cash will score us some lemon
bars from the kitchen,

04:46.377 --> 04:50.724
and then the big finale...
We leave before she's back

04:50.854 --> 04:51.757
from her early-bird dinner.

04:51.896 --> 04:53.764
That brings us to the next part
of our plan-today's lunch.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.130
Paninis on me.

04:56.676 --> 04:58.573
Technically, it's panino.

04:58.793 --> 05:00.560
See, "panini" is plural.

05:00.689 --> 05:03.147
Many panini, one panino.

05:03.272 --> 05:04.584
So now you know.

05:04.733 --> 05:08.304
This is why you get no "vagino."
So now you know.

05:08.452 --> 05:09.414
Shut it.

05:09.546 --> 05:12.755
You haven't even noticed that
hot-tay with the latte...

05:13.345 --> 05:15.401
Totally eye-humping you again.

05:15.534 --> 05:17.595
Damn it. I hate when Oz is right.

05:17.722 --> 05:21.082
I mean, I am too fixated on Melanie.
Look at that girl.

05:21.340 --> 05:23.477
Okay, here's what we do.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.669
We follow her out to her
car when she leaves,

05:26.819 --> 05:28.820
get her license plate number,
take that to the D.M.V.,

05:28.959 --> 05:31.007
get her name, hack into her e-mail account,

05:31.143 --> 05:32.796
find out what type of bedsheets she likes,

05:32.926 --> 05:35.875
then we buy a set.
Now here's where it gets a little weird...

05:36.002 --> 05:37.572
We're gonna need a sample of her hair.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.370
Why don't I just go talk to her?

05:39.518 --> 05:42.421
Like in Chatroulette?
In person?

05:42.547 --> 05:45.558
That's ballsy. Cam, that's too ballsy.

05:45.700 --> 05:46.818
Cam.

05:47.119 --> 05:48.871
Hey.
Hi.

05:49.003 --> 05:50.256
You need some help?

05:50.397 --> 05:52.643
Oh, this happens all the time.

05:52.790 --> 05:55.190
It's an old computer.
I just need to get another one.

05:55.333 --> 05:58.797
Or I can help you clean up your registry.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.149
Okay.

06:01.282 --> 06:02.288
Here.

06:06.119 --> 06:06.962
Okay.

06:07.091 --> 06:09.498
Now you're back into...

06:09.690 --> 06:10.638
Yeah,

06:10.940 --> 06:12.676
dying of embarrassment.

06:12.810 --> 06:15.484
But for the record, I haven't
officially signed up yet.

06:15.614 --> 06:17.458
I don't know. 50 bucks a month
seems kinda high to meet

06:17.590 --> 06:19.570
some divorced guy looking
for a pity bang, you know?

06:19.697 --> 06:20.645
Yeah, totally.

06:20.760 --> 06:22.064
Check this out.

06:23.210 --> 06:25.315
Site's free, your profile's invisible,

06:25.449 --> 06:27.651
and now you get more bang for your buck.

06:27.765 --> 06:33.108
That is the coolest/uncoolest
thing I've ever seen.

06:33.229 --> 06:36.008
Thank you. I work in security.
I hack for a living.

06:36.126 --> 06:37.792
You're kidding. What a coincidence.

06:37.933 --> 06:40.808
I hack plaque. I'm a dentist.
Oh.

06:40.948 --> 06:42.401
And in my professional opinion,

06:42.539 --> 06:45.427
you have a very nice smile.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.947
Nice line. I assume you've used it before?

06:48.091 --> 06:50.545
Uh, just with the guys I
wanna drill in my chair.

06:51.726 --> 06:52.970
Yeah, that didn't come out right.

06:53.114 --> 06:56.609
No. No, I got it.
Sex, right?

06:57.181 --> 06:58.266
I'm Amy, by the way.

06:58.403 --> 07:00.818
Cam. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

07:00.985 --> 07:03.372
Amy is amazing. She's smart. She's funny.

07:03.497 --> 07:06.233
She listens to me.
She's- too good to be true.

07:06.356 --> 07:10.071
- Okay, what's the catch here?
A wonky eye? Baby arm? - No.

07:10.202 --> 07:12.743
Testicles? No.
I mean, maybe she's a little older

07:12.858 --> 07:14.960
than the girls I usually
date, but I like that.

07:15.089 --> 07:17.743
No drama, no humping dogs. It's awesome.

07:17.866 --> 07:21.537
Okay, I know it is, man.
Older woman. That cougar.

07:22.176 --> 07:25.051
Oh, my boy is tappin' the grave!

07:25.293 --> 07:27.387
? Tappin' the grave, oh ?

07:27.528 --> 07:29.625
Uh, no. * Tappin' the grave *
All right, Cash. I... Yeah.

07:29.733 --> 07:32.474
Tappin' the grave, tappin' the grave.
Open the coffin...

07:32.597 --> 07:34.072
Hey, who's tappin' the grave?

07:34.219 --> 07:36.326
No-no one. No one.
No one is tapping anything.

07:36.461 --> 07:38.772
No, no. He's doing the
"tappin' the grave" dance.

07:38.887 --> 07:39.648
That's what's up.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.921
Wait a second. Are you the tapper?

07:42.058 --> 07:43.772
No.
You tappin'!

07:43.902 --> 07:46.598
I don't even... Come on!
I'm proud of you! Get in there!

07:46.744 --> 07:48.853
Yeah, you little devil!
Okay,

07:48.965 --> 07:50.389
all right. All right, enough tap talk.

07:50.531 --> 07:52.218
I think Oz would rather us focus on the job

07:52.353 --> 07:56.980
and-and-and not my love life.
That's-yeah. Ooh, the tapper

07:57.107 --> 08:02.043
the tapper tappin' that grave

08:02.175 --> 08:05.398
I am so proud of you.

08:05.521 --> 08:07.455
Excuse me?
I hear you got a new squeeze.

08:07.572 --> 08:08.180
Come on, what's she like?

08:08.302 --> 08:10.564
She have arthritis in the hands?
I don't...

08:10.683 --> 08:12.331
That's my colorful way
of saying "big boobs."

08:12.460 --> 08:14.060
Wait. Where did you hear about that?

08:14.193 --> 08:15.778
Same way I hear about
everything in this office...

08:15.918 --> 08:18.883
The old water cooler cam.
You're never at the water cooler.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.536
No, no, no. I have a water cooler cam.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.758
So long story short, the doctor got it out,

08:24.879 --> 08:26.553
and I get to be in a medical journal.

08:26.947 --> 08:30.291
Hmm. That is a complete and
utter invasion of our privacy.

08:30.427 --> 08:33.609
Yes. Yes, it is, but I
invade because I care.

08:33.797 --> 08:35.917
Speaking of which, I'm glad
you finally took my advice

08:36.052 --> 08:38.732
and moved on from Melanie.
No, look, I really like this girl.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.369
I'm not with her 'cause I took your advice.

08:40.481 --> 08:41.832
Well, you should start.

08:41.974 --> 08:45.506
Let's class things up a little, peanut.
Here, take this shirt.

08:45.641 --> 08:47.273
It'll really make those baby blues pop.

08:47.404 --> 08:51.109
No, I don't- oh, that is so soft.

08:51.239 --> 08:54.198
And this- Chilean wild orchids...

08:54.346 --> 08:56.565
very, very rare.

08:57.083 --> 08:58.757
Smells so good. Thank you.

08:58.895 --> 09:00.612
That's how I bedded Mrs. Oz,

09:00.742 --> 09:02.090
the she-beast.

09:02.211 --> 09:04.618
Now you go and bust into that safe.

09:05.166 --> 09:07.388
I'm gonna get back to my stories.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.142
All right, guys, let's rob this old lady.

09:09.278 --> 09:11.810
To grandmother's house we go.

09:14.787 --> 09:17.915
No way. Grandma's making this too easy.

09:18.067 --> 09:21.157
Oh, nice! We'll be in and out...

09:21.866 --> 09:24.208
Can't let go! Insides burning!

09:24.330 --> 09:25.589
Someone help me!

09:25.719 --> 09:27.247
Ooh! I should've thought this through!

09:27.394 --> 09:29.029
I'll cut the power. Don't panic.

09:30.672 --> 09:33.356
Panic! Panic as hard as you can!

09:36.899 --> 09:39.223
The house is alive!

09:41.032 --> 09:42.727
So not good.

09:47.759 --> 09:49.348
It's been a rough job so far.

09:49.497 --> 09:50.654
Apparently this old lady's house

09:50.770 --> 09:52.597
is a geriatric Fort Knox.
No, I'll tell you

09:52.720 --> 09:55.801
what we're dealing with here...
Super villain.

09:55.917 --> 09:58.124
Okay, if we keep this up,
we're gonna be facing

09:58.226 --> 10:01.143
her army of monkey assassins, for real.
Seriously.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.968
I mean, who the hell is this old woman?

10:05.145 --> 10:08.301
I lost my brows in the line of duty.
No, it's good.

10:08.431 --> 10:11.406
Brings out your huge forehead.
Don't even speak.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.454
We have been out there
getting our asses kicked,

10:13.582 --> 10:16.257
and you don't even have a scratch on you.
I ripped my jeans.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.180
No, you bought 'em that
way, and they look great.

10:18.297 --> 10:21.618
Guys, our job is to find flaws
in security systems, right?

10:21.746 --> 10:23.561
We'll just tell Oz this
lady doesn't have any.

10:23.701 --> 10:24.953
It's good news for the client.
No,

10:25.087 --> 10:29.064
are you crazy?
You never tell Oz you failed ever.

10:29.195 --> 10:32.662
We haven't failed.
I'm sure Oz will under... stand.

10:32.808 --> 10:35.350
This is my subtle way of saying

10:35.491 --> 10:37.624
"Go and crack that safe."

10:42.260 --> 10:43.920
Lord, that is hot.

10:44.047 --> 10:45.922
Aw, I bet you say that to all the hackers.

10:46.046 --> 10:46.972
I'm talking about the plates.

10:47.093 --> 10:49.286
The plates are hot. They're hot.
Oh, uh, yes. Sorry. Sorry.

10:49.638 --> 10:50.687
Whew. My boss has made it

10:50.829 --> 10:53.621
terrifyingly clear I
can't screw up this job.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.231
Although I might've found a lead.

10:56.637 --> 10:59.502
Ooh, that sounds juicy. Let me see.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.896
Yeah, I don't want to bore you.
Let's just...

11:02.033 --> 11:04.626
Let's just hang out, you and me.

11:06.961 --> 11:11.792
I... got you a little something.

11:12.082 --> 11:13.628
What's this?
I just thought

11:13.755 --> 11:15.684
it could help you make
some tough decisions,

11:15.826 --> 11:17.532
you know?
Thank you.

11:18.080 --> 11:21.241
Well, don't thank me yet.
See if it works first.

11:21.387 --> 11:22.680
All right.

11:23.568 --> 11:26.383
Will I get lucky tonight?

11:27.411 --> 11:29.570
Well, will you?

11:29.705 --> 11:30.975
No!

11:34.638 --> 11:36.974
We're breaking into your house!

11:37.119 --> 11:39.134
Popcorn shrimp?
I bought a fryer.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.013
I hacked into the county records web site

11:41.142 --> 11:43.043
and found the architect
who built the house,

11:43.167 --> 11:44.615
for you.
You know, it's never wise

11:44.749 --> 11:46.953
to yell at a man who could
deep-fry your cojones.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.357
You said for us to break into
some crazy old lady's house.

11:50.499 --> 11:51.304
And you are.

11:51.442 --> 11:53.827
You're breaking into my old lady's house,

11:53.967 --> 11:55.791
and believe you me, she is crazy.
Stop. Stop.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.252
For once, please just
tell me what's going on,

11:57.408 --> 11:59.128
so I can do my job.

11:59.275 --> 12:01.521
Fine. I'm no fan of clichés,

12:01.638 --> 12:03.704
but I happen to be in one of
the oldest stories there is.

12:03.850 --> 12:05.984
Man loves woman, man marries woman,

12:06.108 --> 12:07.880
woman turns out to be an evil succubus

12:08.011 --> 12:09.867
looking for a fast divorce.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.796
Sorry. Um, I didn't know that.
I could really use a hug.

12:13.923 --> 12:15.477
And I'd rather not be
put in a sleeper hold.

12:15.587 --> 12:17.517
Good! You're learning - never touch me.

12:17.677 --> 12:20.294
And you're manipulating us into
helping you win your divorce.

12:20.429 --> 12:21.962
That's-that's not- that's not our job.

12:22.094 --> 12:25.325
It is now.
That devil woman knows this company

12:25.461 --> 12:27.267
is the most important
thing to me in my life.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.696
She wants it just to spite me.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.213
If I don't give it to her in the divorce,

12:30.366 --> 12:32.313
she's gonna go public
with what's in that safe,

12:32.434 --> 12:36.082
and no one can ever see
what is in that safe.

12:36.207 --> 12:39.087
Okay, well, if it's your house,

12:39.414 --> 12:42.156
why don't you tell me how to break in?
I wish I knew.

12:42.292 --> 12:43.769
That praying mantis seems to have learned

12:43.905 --> 12:45.426
a thing or two about security from me,

12:45.579 --> 12:48.154
and she seems to always be
one step ahead somehow.

12:48.271 --> 12:49.124
You think there's a leak?

12:49.266 --> 12:50.840
It's the only explanation.

12:52.901 --> 12:54.837
Amy knows too much.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.370
Amy.

13:00.292 --> 13:04.106
Amy, open up. I know you live here.
Oz told me everything.

13:05.629 --> 13:07.852
Oh. Hey, Cameron.

13:09.518 --> 13:10.915
I'm the leak.

13:11.297 --> 13:14.209
I'm-I'm the reason I can't
break into your house.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.696
And then we're gonna climb the trellis

13:15.819 --> 13:18.189
and break in through the skylight.
Mm.

13:18.311 --> 13:20.386
Thanks for being such a great listener.

13:20.745 --> 13:23.081
Thanks for being such a great talker.

13:23.335 --> 13:26.489
Lies. It was all lies.

13:26.622 --> 13:28.792
Are you even a dentist?
No.

13:28.924 --> 13:32.020
I flossed for you!
Honey, you're supposed to floss.

13:32.138 --> 13:34.784
Oh, my God.
Played by my own girlfriend.

13:36.453 --> 13:39.107
It was only two weeks.
What are we, in second grade?

13:39.236 --> 13:42.985
Uh, no, it was a very intense two weeks,

13:43.107 --> 13:45.551
and it was implied, I mean, I thought.

13:46.210 --> 13:48.812
We didn't put a label-
I'm a relationship guy.

13:48.947 --> 13:51.014
Doesn't matter. It's over forever.

13:51.161 --> 13:52.357
Oh, come on.

13:54.065 --> 13:56.324
We had a good time together, didn't we?

13:59.493 --> 14:02.460
Fry your cojones.

14:02.603 --> 14:03.660
I gotta go.

14:05.973 --> 14:07.206
Good thing you called me, Mel.

14:07.335 --> 14:09.507
We got ourselves a serious
grooming sitch here.

14:09.637 --> 14:11.302
Hey, would you stop squirming around?

14:11.444 --> 14:13.468
I can't manscape a moving target.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.028
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

14:15.175 --> 14:18.742
They seem kinda high.
Uh, he looks dumb.

14:18.911 --> 14:21.623
He looks interested. Watch this.

14:21.772 --> 14:23.263
You know I ride a dune buggy?

14:24.671 --> 14:26.879
You see that? Huh?

14:27.014 --> 14:28.668
I know brows, broheim.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.934
And it doesn't stop there.

14:31.067 --> 14:33.946
Every night, I trim the hedges.

14:34.087 --> 14:35.562
Oh. It's like Italian marble down there.

14:35.678 --> 14:37.851
Hey, Cash. Cash. Cash.

14:37.992 --> 14:39.572
You really should look at this.
Hey, man, I'm out.

14:39.686 --> 14:41.602
It's not-you sure?
Yo, what's up?

14:41.736 --> 14:44.666
I need help, big-time. Please.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.121
I mean, we're friends.
Anything you need.

14:46.264 --> 14:48.682
What's the problem?
I kinda...

14:48.813 --> 14:49.972
Sort of...

14:51.233 --> 14:54.389
Definitely dated Oz's wife.

14:55.735 --> 14:57.872
No. No, no.

14:57.992 --> 14:59.634
No, I didn't hear that.
I'm clicking "unfriend."

14:59.757 --> 15:02.438
No, go away. Go away! W- w-w-wait.
What are you doing? Wait.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.285
Wait, Cash. Wait. Wait.

15:04.419 --> 15:07.373
The man reads lips.
I don't want him to kill me, too.

15:07.508 --> 15:08.600
Look, I was a pawn, okay?

15:08.719 --> 15:10.077
The old lady's house we're breaking into

15:10.199 --> 15:12.914
belongs to Amy.
Cover your mouth, bitch!

15:14.223 --> 15:15.012
Look...

15:15.144 --> 15:16.950
She is blackmailing Oz.

15:17.081 --> 15:18.369
All right, we need to break into that safe,

15:18.499 --> 15:19.185
steal whatever's there,

15:19.322 --> 15:22.121
and keep this whole thing quiet.
Keep what quiet?

15:23.682 --> 15:26.201
Our-our fantasy football league.
Yeah.

15:26.309 --> 15:29.296
Cash wasn't sure if you were
cool with that kind of thing.

15:29.411 --> 15:33.111
Yeah. Wasn't even sure about that.

15:34.220 --> 15:37.442
I'll allow it.
Send out an e-mail blast, commissioner.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.609
All right.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.951
Damn it. Now I gotta come up
with a fantasy football league,

15:41.086 --> 15:43.562
whatever the hell that is.
Guys, everything okay?

15:43.683 --> 15:46.239
No, everything is very much not okay.

15:46.377 --> 15:47.499
You wanna know why? Uh...

15:47.625 --> 15:51.195
This man just made sweet love on Oz's wife.

15:51.323 --> 15:52.625
What? What?

15:52.764 --> 15:55.363
I didn't know it was Oz's wife,
and I didn't make sweet anything

15:55.481 --> 15:57.851
on anyone, all right? The woman used me.

15:57.984 --> 16:01.512
Oz owns a sword. You do realize that.
Oz isn't gonna find out.

16:01.632 --> 16:05.727
The last thing I'm gonna do
is get played by Amy again.

16:08.494 --> 16:09.871
Wanna bet?

16:11.955 --> 16:13.659
I know you guys can't tell by my face,

16:13.800 --> 16:16.212
but I am shocked right now.

16:20.009 --> 16:22.328
Okay, here's the plan. It's very risky,

16:22.474 --> 16:25.006
highly unconventional, but I
think it might just work.

16:25.168 --> 16:27.230
We break into Amy's house this afternoon.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.496
In broad daylight? That's too risky, man.

16:29.635 --> 16:31.304
Trust me.
I know who we're dealing with now.

16:31.430 --> 16:32.455
When I was inside Amy's house,

16:32.595 --> 16:34.477
I got a good look at her alarm system.

16:34.611 --> 16:36.002
It's fingerprint-activated.

16:36.153 --> 16:38.693
Okay, how are we gonna get her fingerprint?

16:38.840 --> 16:41.610
We already got it. I might've found a lead.

16:41.737 --> 16:45.220
Ooh! Sounds juicy. Let me see.

16:45.980 --> 16:50.254
Jackpot. Newbie.

16:50.673 --> 16:52.076
Every Tuesday at 4:00,

16:52.205 --> 16:54.193
she comes home from yoga, makes a smoothie,

16:54.312 --> 16:57.406
takes a shower. That's when we strike.

16:57.526 --> 16:59.012
Head-to-toe rubber.

16:59.156 --> 17:01.513
Try to shock me now, you old bitch.

17:01.627 --> 17:03.252
She's not that old.

17:16.374 --> 17:17.577
Come on.

17:20.797 --> 17:22.446
We're good.

17:22.617 --> 17:23.865
Yes!

17:34.377 --> 17:36.886
Well-played, Cammy.

17:38.597 --> 17:40.090
This is so exciting.

17:40.224 --> 17:41.966
It's like we're cracking Al Capone's vault.

17:42.091 --> 17:45.266
I wonder what's in there.
I really hope it's an Oz sex tape.

17:45.384 --> 17:48.238
I bet he goes slow, then
fast, then slow again.

17:48.374 --> 17:49.653
That's what I'd do.

17:51.480 --> 17:52.536
Okay.

17:55.165 --> 17:56.846
It's a human thumb.

17:56.983 --> 17:59.069
Do all y'all have your thumbs?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.205
Seriously, dude?

18:02.051 --> 18:03.308
Flash drive.

18:03.456 --> 18:05.666
Oh, sex tape, sex tape, sex tape.

18:05.791 --> 18:07.657
It's not a sex tape. Come on.

18:07.810 --> 18:09.707
I still say sex tape.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.960
Whoa! Uh, sorry. We-we can come back.

18:16.690 --> 18:17.904
"We"?

18:19.636 --> 18:21.040
Bastards.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.537
Don't just stand there. Come on in.

18:22.672 --> 18:24.627
There's, uh, somebody I'd love you to meet.

18:26.310 --> 18:27.347
Hello.

18:28.391 --> 18:29.525
I'm Amy.

18:29.648 --> 18:33.024
Yeah. Amy, hi. It's a pleasure to meet you,

18:33.176 --> 18:35.731
now, right for the very first time.

18:36.126 --> 18:38.714
You're gonna be seeing a lot
more of my wife around here.

18:38.828 --> 18:40.027
You mean you've...

18:40.148 --> 18:42.990
Reconciled.
Right on this desk, twice.

18:43.111 --> 18:44.929
Mm. What?

18:45.040 --> 18:47.352
I should get going.
Mm. Mm, okay.

18:47.461 --> 18:50.451
So I'll see you around...
what did you say your name was again?

18:50.573 --> 18:52.085
Just go.

18:57.376 --> 18:59.421
She seems nice.

18:59.691 --> 19:00.404
Really?
Yeah.

19:00.524 --> 19:04.097
You, uh, find her sexually attractive?

19:04.233 --> 19:06.596
No, no, no. She's not my type.
So you wouldn't say,

19:06.741 --> 19:08.083
pick her up at a panino shop,

19:08.225 --> 19:09.787
take her out for a wild night on the town,

19:09.929 --> 19:11.754
Italian dinner, romantic movie,

19:11.864 --> 19:14.718
top off the evening with a
nice mocha chip fro-yo?

19:14.895 --> 19:17.191
Oh, my... God.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.384
I know all. I see all.

19:19.670 --> 19:21.213
You know what?
If it makes you feel any better,

19:21.368 --> 19:23.289
I should probably be on this site myself.

19:23.424 --> 19:24.725
I knew what that little minx was up to

19:24.850 --> 19:26.779
the moment she sat down with you.

19:26.930 --> 19:29.326
That's why I fitted you with that wire.
Take this.

19:29.453 --> 19:32.164
And I gave you those beautiful
flowers-romantic for you,

19:32.289 --> 19:34.978
useful for me.
Here you go.

19:35.099 --> 19:38.497
Oh, thank you.
Mmm.

19:38.784 --> 19:41.072
Are you freakin' crazy?
You had me date your wife?

19:41.208 --> 19:43.096
What's wrong with you?
I could've slept with her.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.775
Oh, you really think you had a shot?

19:44.914 --> 19:47.058
That's adorable. Don't lose that.

19:47.210 --> 19:48.546
All right, fine. What's on the drive then?

19:48.670 --> 19:49.737
You put us through hell for this thing.

19:49.881 --> 19:52.206
I wanna know.
Let me ask you a question, kid.

19:52.331 --> 19:54.111
Before you started working
for me, would you

19:54.232 --> 19:56.877
have described yourself as
a good guy or a bad guy?

19:57.008 --> 19:58.125
Good guy for the most part,

19:58.245 --> 19:59.408
but I hacked for whoever paid me.

19:59.536 --> 20:01.797
That's pretty much the
situation with everybody here.

20:01.938 --> 20:04.542
We've all done some bad things
in the past, including me,

20:04.673 --> 20:07.224
and it's all on this thumb drive...

20:07.348 --> 20:09.844
A lot of dirt that can get
us in a lot of trouble.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.165
So this whole time you were protecting us?

20:13.368 --> 20:14.796
I didn't say that.

20:14.941 --> 20:16.916
So that's it?
You're gonna get back together with Amy

20:17.038 --> 20:19.806
like nothing ever happened?
Look, my relationship with Amy

20:19.932 --> 20:21.521
is a delicate and disturbing dance.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.256
This is our third split this year.
I know she's bad for me,

20:24.381 --> 20:26.735
but it's the kind of bad
that feels a little good.

20:26.867 --> 20:29.655
What can I say?
Moving on is easier said than done.

20:29.774 --> 20:32.408
Doors are closing. Watch your fingers.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.467
Hey.

20:39.594 --> 20:40.944
You okay?

20:41.105 --> 20:42.320
Yeah.

20:42.462 --> 20:43.312
Yeah, I'm good.

20:43.449 --> 20:47.147
Good. So do you have any
plans on Saturday night?

20:47.306 --> 20:51.416
I thought you could do me a favor.
Oh, good. More dogsitting?

20:53.653 --> 20:56.406
Jason Mraz?
Yeah, Dutch won't go with me.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.981
He thinks the guy stole his songs.

20:59.929 --> 21:03.280
You in?
The least I could do.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.652
All right. All right.

21:06.820 --> 21:07.508
Wait.

21:07.652 --> 21:08.397
So...

21:10.034 --> 21:12.049
I'll-I'll call you.

21:12.197 --> 21:15.154
We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.

21:19.469 --> 21:21.415
Well-played, Cameron.
