00:02.068 --> 00:05.271
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

00:07.524 --> 00:09.943
You missing something, Woody?

00:09.943 --> 00:13.446
Yeah, well, I had a $20 bill
in my pocket and now it's gone.

00:13.446 --> 00:15.782
Well, say good-bye
to that Andy Jackson.

00:15.782 --> 00:19.536
Oh, see you later, Andy.

00:19.536 --> 00:21.421
CLIFF: Boy, oh, boy.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.423
Talk about your lucky days, huh?

00:23.423 --> 00:25.925
Just found 20 smackers
back there in the pool room.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.427
Yeah, and to celebrate my good fortune,

00:27.427 --> 00:30.296
I'm gonna buy a round of
drinks for all my, uh, friends.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.799
What are you gonna do
with the other 19 bucks?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.302
Woody, that could be your $20 bill.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.303
The one you lost.

00:37.303 --> 00:40.306
Hey, yeah, you know, I was
in the pool room earlier.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.307
Wait a second.

00:41.307 --> 00:42.692
Now let's be fair about this.

00:42.692 --> 00:44.310
Uh, give me the serial number.

00:44.310 --> 00:45.445
Oh, come on, man.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.814
Nobody knows serial numbers.

00:47.814 --> 00:52.318
L-2-1-8-8-6-1-1-9-B

00:56.740 --> 00:58.241
That's amazing.

00:59.743 --> 01:01.127
How'd you do that?

01:01.127 --> 01:04.129
Oh, I memorize the serial
numbers on all my currency.

01:04.129 --> 01:04.998
Why?

01:05.498 --> 01:07.383
For just such an occasion.

01:08.752 --> 01:11.721
Tell you, though, I pray
everyday I don't get rich.

01:11.721 --> 01:17.644
(piano plays)

01:17.644 --> 01:20.096
? Making your way in the world today ?

01:20.096 --> 01:23.099
? Takes everything you've got ?

01:23.099 --> 01:25.602
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

01:26.102 --> 01:28.605
? Sure would help a lot ?

01:28.605 --> 01:34.494
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

01:34.494 --> 01:37.280
? Sometimes you want to go ?

01:37.280 --> 01:42.285
? Where everybody knows your name ?

01:42.285 --> 01:47.290
? And they're always glad you came ?

01:47.290 --> 01:49.793
? You want to be where you can see ?

01:49.793 --> 01:52.295
? Our troubles are all the same ?

01:52.295 --> 01:57.300
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

01:57.300 --> 02:00.303
? You want to go where people know ?

02:00.303 --> 02:02.305
? People are all the same ?

02:02.806 --> 02:06.810
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

02:26.796 --> 02:28.081
Oh, groom.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.833
Hmm?

02:29.833 --> 02:32.168
Sweetheart, we're
going to have to decide

02:32.168 --> 02:34.170
where we're going for our honeymoon.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.672
Where do you want to go?

02:36.172 --> 02:36.673
Boy, I don't know.

02:37.173 --> 02:38.675
Where, where, where do you want to go?

02:38.675 --> 02:41.678
I told you where I
want to go-- Tibet.

02:41.678 --> 02:42.679
Well, it's our honeymoon.

02:42.679 --> 02:44.564
Of course we're going to bed.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.900
No, you whammo.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.902
Tibet the country.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.270
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:52.071 --> 02:54.490
Sam, imagine getting up in the morning

02:54.490 --> 02:56.993
and looking out on
the roof of the world.

02:56.993 --> 02:59.495
Look where we'd stay. Isn't it quaint?

02:59.495 --> 03:01.865
Looks like where the dogs sleep. It is.

03:01.865 --> 03:03.249
The dogs sleep with us.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.252
You wouldn't want to
freeze to death, would you?

03:06.252 --> 03:07.754
Diane,

03:07.754 --> 03:09.756
I didn't sleep with
dogs when I was single.

03:09.756 --> 03:10.757
I'm not about to start now.

03:13.676 --> 03:15.678
For goodness sake,
don't you want to taste

03:16.179 --> 03:18.681
the exciting and fascinating
things that life has to offer?

03:18.681 --> 03:19.682
No.

03:20.183 --> 03:21.684
I'd rather marry you.

03:24.687 --> 03:25.688
Afternoon, everybody.

03:25.688 --> 03:27.190
ALL: Norm!

03:27.190 --> 03:29.442
Hey, Mr. Peterson, what
do you say to a cold one?

03:29.442 --> 03:31.194
"See ya later, Vera, I'll be at Cheers."

03:33.196 --> 03:34.697
You're looking unusually chipper today.

03:34.697 --> 03:36.199
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of chipper, Fras.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.700
Is there any particular reason,

03:37.700 --> 03:39.702
other than the fact that
we live in a democracy

03:39.702 --> 03:42.205
and sushi bars appear
to be on the decline?

03:42.205 --> 03:42.956
Well, I was gonna

03:42.956 --> 03:44.791
tell Vera first, but
why break tradition?

03:44.791 --> 03:46.793
I just landed a great new job

03:46.793 --> 03:48.161
at Masters and Holly and Dixon.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.079
Oh, wonderful!

03:50.079 --> 03:52.548
It's one of the top
C.P.A. firms in Boston.

03:52.548 --> 03:54.050
Yes, I hear that's
quite a successful firm.

03:54.050 --> 03:56.052
You know, over half of their executives

03:56.052 --> 03:57.053
require therapy on a regular basis.

03:57.553 --> 03:58.554
So, uh, here's my card.

03:58.554 --> 04:00.056
Oh, great. Just in case.

04:00.056 --> 04:01.057
Thank you.

04:01.057 --> 04:02.558
It's a very impressive place.

04:02.558 --> 04:04.060
Uh, they occupy the entire 25th floor

04:04.060 --> 04:05.561
of the Boston Towers.

04:05.561 --> 04:06.562
And they hired you?

04:06.562 --> 04:08.064
It must have been the altitude.

04:08.064 --> 04:10.066
No, no, no, no,
seriously, Norm, I'm sorry.

04:10.066 --> 04:13.069
You know, I hope this
works out to be, you know,

04:13.069 --> 04:14.570
sort of a long-term
arrangement for you.

04:14.570 --> 04:16.572
Long enough anyway for them to see you

04:16.572 --> 04:18.274
wear your other suit.

04:18.274 --> 04:20.610
NORM: Very funny. Very funny, you guys.

04:20.610 --> 04:21.611
But I'll have you know they

04:21.611 --> 04:23.112
gave me the key to the executive

04:23.112 --> 04:23.997
washroom this morning.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.782
Did it come with a bucket and mop?

04:25.782 --> 04:27.784
Laugh all you want, okay,

04:27.784 --> 04:30.286
but I think this is
finally the job for me.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.255
I've got a secretary.

04:32.255 --> 04:33.122
I have an expense account,

04:33.122 --> 04:34.841
a very ritzy office

04:34.841 --> 04:36.125
all to myself, so...

04:36.125 --> 04:37.627
Good for you, Norman.

04:37.627 --> 04:40.129
How about a round of applause
for our new executive?

04:40.129 --> 04:41.514
(middling applause)

04:44.467 --> 04:45.969
Well, I started late.

04:45.969 --> 04:47.470
I didn't want to be impolite.

04:50.473 --> 04:52.725
I'm really excited for
you, Norman. Thanks.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.527
I can tell by the way you're talking

04:54.527 --> 04:57.030
that this is the job that's
going to fire your enthusiasm.

04:58.147 --> 04:59.449
When do you start?

04:59.449 --> 05:00.950
About, uh, three hours ago.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.872
What are you doing here?

05:05.872 --> 05:07.874
I didn't want to appear
over-anxious, you know.

05:07.874 --> 05:11.127
Yeah, no danger there, huh, Buddy?

05:11.127 --> 05:12.962
No, no, I'm on my lunch hour.

05:12.962 --> 05:13.963
DIANE: Oh.

05:13.963 --> 05:16.466
But, you know, I could
be late if I wanted to.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.468
I mean, I got free rein over there.

05:18.468 --> 05:19.969
I happen to be my own boss.

05:19.969 --> 05:21.471
So that's how you got the job.

05:21.471 --> 05:24.474
Thanks for the send-off, guys.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.930
Well, I hope you're
all proud of yourselves.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.432
SAM: Why?

05:32.432 --> 05:32.932
What'd we do?

05:33.433 --> 05:34.934
Well, I think we could have been

05:34.934 --> 05:37.937
a bit more thunderous in our applause.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.439
(clears throat)

05:39.439 --> 05:42.442
Uh, except for Woody.

05:42.442 --> 05:45.445
Sam, didn't you see the
hurt in Norman's eyes?

05:45.945 --> 05:48.448
He was seeking our support and approval.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.949
It's his first day on the job

05:49.949 --> 05:52.452
and all we did was give him jibes.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.870
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.373
He's had hundreds of
first days on the job.

05:58.374 --> 06:00.126
You know, Diane's right.

06:00.126 --> 06:01.427
It's obvious how much we mean to him.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.795
I think we may have let him down.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.597
Oh... Gee, I hope not.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.015
Yeah, me, too.

06:06.015 --> 06:08.017
Oh, too late to do
anything about that now.

06:08.017 --> 06:09.886
Refill, huh, Sam?

06:09.886 --> 06:13.639
Hey, it's not too late.

06:13.639 --> 06:16.392
We could march en masse

06:16.392 --> 06:19.062
down to Norman's office and show
him that we're in his corner.

06:19.062 --> 06:20.363
Oh, sure.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.365
Perhaps buy the new hotshot
a little office warming gift.

06:22.365 --> 06:23.366
Maybe a potted plant.

06:23.366 --> 06:24.233
Good!

06:24.233 --> 06:25.151
Okay, hurry up.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.152
Let's get going here.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.120
Wonderful, Carla.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.621
That's the kind of enthusiasm

06:28.621 --> 06:30.123
that's going to make Norman feel better.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.574
The hell with that yutz.

06:31.574 --> 06:32.575
I wanna go downtown and see

06:33.076 --> 06:35.962
some Yuppie buns in tight Italian suits.

06:35.962 --> 06:37.830
Well, then it's settled.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.715
We'll go.

06:39.715 --> 06:41.134
Wish I could join you,

06:41.134 --> 06:43.136
but I've got an appointment at 1:00.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.137
Oh, what the hell?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.139
Mrs. Segal's rather
a compulsive cleaner.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.641
If I'm a little late, maybe
she'll tidy up the office.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.094
Give my best to Norm.

06:51.094 --> 06:52.595
Well, aren't you coming?

06:52.595 --> 06:54.597
Oh, I gotta take care of the bar here.

06:54.597 --> 06:58.101
Oh, Sam, we've got to show Norman

06:58.101 --> 07:00.603
our impressive phalanx.

07:00.603 --> 07:01.604
Oh, that's all right, honey.

07:01.604 --> 07:03.106
He saw mine at the gym.

07:09.996 --> 07:11.781
CLIFF: And then there
was this 1938 accident

07:11.781 --> 07:14.283
where the elevator plunged 86 floors.

07:14.283 --> 07:16.285
Get me out of this thing!

07:16.285 --> 07:18.287
Oh, my.

07:18.287 --> 07:21.791
What an exquisite place
to come to work everyday.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.794
Have you ever seen such
sumptuous surroundings?

07:24.794 --> 07:27.296
Well, you obviously
haven't been to the, uh,

07:27.296 --> 07:28.798
new downtown postal annex, Diane.

07:28.798 --> 07:32.301
So, uh, where's Woody?

07:32.301 --> 07:33.302
I hope he's not lost.

07:33.302 --> 07:35.304
Gee, what are the odds?

07:35.304 --> 07:38.307
2511. Here we are.

07:38.307 --> 07:39.308
(gasps)

07:39.308 --> 07:42.562
Damn. Got another one
of those carpet shocks.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.397
Well, Carla, if you'd walk like a lady,

07:44.397 --> 07:45.398
that wouldn't happen.

07:45.398 --> 07:48.234
If I walked like a lady,
nothing would happen.

07:53.456 --> 07:54.457
Sorry I'm late.

07:54.457 --> 07:56.459
Ah, Woody, uh,

07:56.459 --> 07:58.461
couldn't you find a bigger one?

07:58.461 --> 07:59.962
No.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.964
You know,

08:01.964 --> 08:03.966
at the risk of sounding
self-congratulatory,

08:03.966 --> 08:05.468
I think we're fabulous.

08:05.468 --> 08:06.669
Just think

08:06.669 --> 08:09.555
how Norman will appreciate this.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.474
You know, I remember the first day

08:11.474 --> 08:14.343
I worked at The Third Eye Bookstore.

08:14.343 --> 08:17.180
Ramu was explaining to me
the difference between...

08:17.180 --> 08:20.016
I think it was between
psychic and occult.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.017
Ouch!

08:23.402 --> 08:26.856
Think we could get
this carpet for the bar?

08:26.856 --> 08:29.358
All right. Everyone ready?

08:30.860 --> 08:32.861
ALL: Surprise!

08:35.865 --> 08:38.868
Don't you guys ever think
about maybe calling first?

08:38.868 --> 08:40.836
Yeah, well, we couldn't
find a phone booth.

08:40.836 --> 08:42.837
Until now.

08:45.007 --> 08:47.343
Say, did anybody ever see Das Boot?

08:49.345 --> 08:50.680
What're you guys doing here?

08:50.680 --> 08:52.598
Well, we wanted to come down

08:52.598 --> 08:55.601
and celebrate your
first day on the new job.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.470
WOODY: Yeah, we brought you a gift.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.889
Uh, let me find the
perfect spot for this.

09:05.394 --> 09:07.396
There.

09:07.396 --> 09:09.398
Don't forget to water it.

09:09.398 --> 09:14.403
Thanks, I'll write myself a note, Woody.

09:14.403 --> 09:17.406
So, guys, I, uh...

09:17.406 --> 09:20.910
guess I probably exaggerated
a little bit about the office.

09:20.910 --> 09:22.378
(chuckling )

09:22.378 --> 09:24.297
But, uh, you know, it's just 'cause

09:24.297 --> 09:25.548
you were razzing me so much,

09:25.548 --> 09:26.832
and it's actually quite

09:26.832 --> 09:28.334
a big step to have an office at all.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.720
I mean, many people in this
firm have to share an office.

09:30.720 --> 09:31.587
(knocking)

09:31.587 --> 09:34.090
Oh, just a sec. Sorry.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.091
Yeah?

09:35.091 --> 09:37.093
Just, uh, set it right
here, that's fine.

09:40.096 --> 09:41.097
Let me guess.

09:41.097 --> 09:41.981
Peterson.

09:41.981 --> 09:42.898
Right.

09:42.898 --> 09:44.400
I'm Thompkins.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.402
Looks like we're office partners.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.961
So...

09:54.961 --> 09:57.246
if you're lookin' for a
secretary, I'm available.

09:57.246 --> 09:59.749
But I want you to know
I do not take shorthand,

09:59.749 --> 10:01.751
I don't type and I don't make coffee.

10:02.251 --> 10:04.253
Well, what do you do?

10:04.253 --> 10:06.756
Hire me and find out.

10:07.757 --> 10:10.259
Carla, I don't think he caught that.

10:10.259 --> 10:13.262
Next time try to be more obvious.

10:13.262 --> 10:16.265
Okay, let's let Norman get back to work.

10:16.265 --> 10:17.767
Thanks.

10:17.767 --> 10:19.652
Oh, Norman, keep up the spirits, huh?

10:19.652 --> 10:23.022
Remember-- no small
offices, only small people.

10:23.022 --> 10:23.939
That's right, right.

10:23.939 --> 10:25.825
Okay... oh, my God, look at the time.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.193
If I don't get back right now,

10:27.193 --> 10:28.577
Mrs. Segal will be shampooing the rug.

10:28.577 --> 10:29.528
Well, okay.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.530
Thanks, thanks a lot for the plant.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.532
Wait, wait, my supervisor.

10:33.532 --> 10:34.533
Everybody hide.

10:36.535 --> 10:37.536
Peterson.

10:37.536 --> 10:38.537
Hi, sir.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.539
What are all these people doing in here?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.291
Well, they're new clients, sir, and, uh,

10:42.291 --> 10:44.126
we were just holding a little impromptu

10:44.126 --> 10:46.128
seminar on the tax laws, and, uh...

10:46.128 --> 10:48.631
So in conclusion, folks,
I'd like you to, uh,

10:48.631 --> 10:51.100
file early and, um... file out.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.101
Right, fine.

10:52.101 --> 10:53.602
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

10:55.604 --> 10:57.106
Thank you. New clients, sir, so...

10:57.106 --> 10:58.607
You're, uh, you're
Thompkins, aren't you?

10:58.607 --> 10:59.608
Yes, sir.

10:59.608 --> 11:00.609
Yes, well, welcome aboard.

11:00.609 --> 11:01.610
Pay attention.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.612
You can learn a lot from this man.

11:03.612 --> 11:05.114
Thank you, sir. That's
very kind of you to say.

11:05.614 --> 11:07.616
No, I was talking to you.

11:08.617 --> 11:11.620
By the way, sir, I understand
you're a big Red Sox fan.

11:11.620 --> 11:12.621
Yeah.

11:12.621 --> 11:14.073
You know, my father has season tickets,

11:14.073 --> 11:15.574
uh, right behind the dugout. No kidding?

11:15.574 --> 11:16.876
Yeah, you know, I'm, I'm usually so busy

11:16.876 --> 11:19.245
with work here, I, I
rarely get to use them.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.247
Thompkins, let's have lunch.

11:21.247 --> 11:23.215
THOMPKINS: Thank you.

11:23.215 --> 11:24.216
Oh, that's a, wait.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.218
That's a, uh, lovely tie
you've got there, sir.

11:26.218 --> 11:27.720
What, this ugly thing?

11:27.720 --> 11:28.471
Yeah.

11:28.471 --> 11:29.755
Oh, my wife bought it.

11:29.755 --> 11:30.639
Yeah, how is the missus?

11:30.639 --> 11:31.974
We're divorcing.

11:31.974 --> 11:33.476
Well, I hope you stick it to her, sir.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.735
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.103
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm great.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.488
Top of the world, ma!

11:47.773 --> 11:51.527
Hey, the first day at a
new job is always traumatic.

11:51.527 --> 11:52.828
Look at me.

11:52.828 --> 11:55.197
I'm pushing 40, practically
starting over again.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.866
Oh, Norman, that's not true.

11:56.866 --> 11:58.250
Yes, it is.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.502
Yeah?

11:59.502 --> 12:01.287
Yeah, I'm delivering
supplies to the supply room.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.671
This isn't the supply room. Sorry.

12:02.671 --> 12:04.090
Well, it's 2511, right?

12:04.090 --> 12:04.457
Right.

12:04.957 --> 12:05.841
Then it's the supply room.

12:05.841 --> 12:07.042
Well, it may have been

12:07.042 --> 12:08.928
the supply room once, okay,
but now it's my office.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.212
What does it say on this invoice?

12:10.212 --> 12:11.046
2511.

12:11.046 --> 12:11.764
Thank you.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.051
See what I mean, Diane?

12:16.051 --> 12:18.554
I just wasn't meant to be a success.

12:18.554 --> 12:21.056
Norman, may I speak to you for a moment?

12:24.944 --> 12:26.112
You make me sick.

12:27.863 --> 12:28.864
You're a quitter, Norman.

12:28.864 --> 12:30.366
No, you're worse than that.

12:30.366 --> 12:31.867
You're a non-starter.

12:31.867 --> 12:33.869
You don't even try.

12:33.869 --> 12:35.287
You sit around the bar all day.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.789
You sit around your house all day.

12:36.789 --> 12:38.290
You sit around here all day.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.291
You sit around life all day.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.993
How are you gonna feel some day

12:40.993 --> 12:43.462
at the end of your
life when you're lying,

12:43.462 --> 12:46.966
no, make that sitting, on your deathbed

12:46.966 --> 12:48.834
and you realize

12:48.834 --> 12:51.670
that the only thing you've
done in your life is sit around

12:51.670 --> 12:53.639
and watch people do things,

12:53.639 --> 12:55.841
make things out of their lives.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.676
Well, maybe you're right, Norman.

12:57.676 --> 13:01.680
Maybe you're not meant for success.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.183
Maybe you're meant for
exactly what you are.

13:04.183 --> 13:06.185
Nothing.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.737
Diane, you have no
right to say that to me.

13:13.692 --> 13:18.447
Norman, I said those things
to you because I care.

13:18.447 --> 13:22.418
You must care an awful lot about me.

13:22.418 --> 13:26.672
Well, I do.

13:26.672 --> 13:29.925
All of your friends care
about you an awful lot.

13:29.925 --> 13:33.429
And we're tired of seeing
you give up so easily.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.936
Maybe I won't give up
so easily this time.

13:42.304 --> 13:43.556
Maybe those harsh, stinging,

13:43.556 --> 13:44.557
offensive words of yours,

13:44.557 --> 13:47.026
words that I'll take to
my grave, by the way...

13:48.310 --> 13:50.529
maybe they finally struck
a cord with me, Diane.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.231
Oh, Norman, do you mean it?

13:52.231 --> 13:54.066
Oh, yes, I do, Diane.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.568
You know, every place I've worked,

13:55.568 --> 13:58.070
my name has been synonymous with patsy.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.789
Well, I think it's high time
my name stood for ruthless.

14:00.789 --> 14:02.491
Now people may not like the new me,

14:02.491 --> 14:04.159
but they're gonna respect the new me.

14:04.159 --> 14:07.046
Diane, I want you to mark
this date on your calendar,

14:07.046 --> 14:08.047
for today is the day

14:08.047 --> 14:09.798
the new me is born.

14:09.798 --> 14:10.966
Happy birthday.

14:10.966 --> 14:12.801
Sign here. Uh-uh.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.503
I'm gonna tell the boss.

14:15.638 --> 14:18.474
No, no, Norman, Norman, Norman...

14:19.842 --> 14:21.427
Thank you, Mr. Springsteen.

14:27.399 --> 14:28.901
Well, it's a start.

14:28.901 --> 14:29.902
Yeah.

14:33.772 --> 14:35.608
You know, I was thinking
while you were gone,

14:35.608 --> 14:36.992
it's not really fair to have you

14:36.992 --> 14:38.944
make all the honeymoon plans,

14:38.944 --> 14:40.946
so I went ahead and I did them myself.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.448
All you have to do

14:42.448 --> 14:46.201
is pack your bags and
set your dial for fun.

14:46.201 --> 14:49.455
Oh, God, it's Niagara Falls, isn't it?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.590
No, it's not Niagara Falls.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.292
That place is a tourist trap.

14:53.292 --> 14:56.211
You ready for this?

14:56.211 --> 15:00.215
Disneyworld.

15:00.215 --> 15:03.719
You want to go to
Disneyworld for our honeymoon?

15:03.719 --> 15:04.720
Oh, yeah.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.721
But, Sam, I always thought

15:06.221 --> 15:08.724
that would be someplace
we'd go when we have kids.

15:08.724 --> 15:09.725
Well, hey, no,

15:09.725 --> 15:10.726
this is not just for kids.

15:11.226 --> 15:14.730
This, this is for
"children of all ages."

15:14.730 --> 15:17.733
I mean, can you say the
same thing about Tibet?

15:17.733 --> 15:21.236
Well, how can you compare
Disneyworld and Tibet...

15:21.236 --> 15:22.738
where we might possibly

15:22.738 --> 15:25.240
unravel the mysteries of life?

15:25.240 --> 15:27.242
Well, there, there are lots of mysteries

15:27.242 --> 15:29.244
you can unravel at Disneyworld.

15:29.244 --> 15:31.747
For example?

15:31.747 --> 15:34.249
Um, all right, all right,

15:34.249 --> 15:36.251
uh, why is it that, uh, Donald Duck

15:36.251 --> 15:38.754
wears a top and no
bottom, whereas Mickey

15:38.754 --> 15:40.756
wears a bottom and no top?

15:43.225 --> 15:45.594
Oh, Sammy, it-it's
because, you know, uh,

15:45.594 --> 15:47.596
a duck's private's are
hidden by their feathers

15:47.596 --> 15:52.351
and mouse's is, uh,
well, need I say more?

15:52.351 --> 15:54.687
While you're at it, I mean, why is it

15:55.187 --> 15:56.488
we've never seen Donald fly?

15:56.488 --> 15:59.491
I mean, I've seen that
damn duck do The Carioca.

15:59.491 --> 16:01.493
Yeah, and if Mickey's dating Minnie,

16:01.493 --> 16:03.495
how come he has such a high voice?

16:03.495 --> 16:04.863
Oh, now, whoa, wait, are you trying

16:04.863 --> 16:06.332
to tell me that Mickey...

16:06.332 --> 16:08.834
All right, all right, all
right, we'll go! We'll go!

16:08.834 --> 16:10.336
Evening, everybody.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.337
ALL: Norm!

16:11.337 --> 16:12.338
DIANE: Norman.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.839
SAM: Well, look at you.

16:13.839 --> 16:15.841
You look like the cat
that swallowed the canary.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.843
Give me a beer to wash him down.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.346
Hey, you're, uh, you're in
kinda late there, me bucko.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.347
So how was your first day?

16:21.347 --> 16:23.849
Well, I tell you, I
feel a lot better now

16:23.849 --> 16:24.850
than I did this morning.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.719
Diane, I took your advice

16:26.719 --> 16:29.722
and I spent the afternoon
jotting down some ideas

16:29.722 --> 16:32.224
I think'll save the
company a lot of money.

16:32.224 --> 16:33.609
Oh, Norman!

16:33.609 --> 16:35.110
That's wonderful!

16:35.110 --> 16:36.612
I'm gonna pitch it to
my supervisor tomorrow.

16:36.612 --> 16:38.614
But, I tell you, I'm a little nervous

16:38.614 --> 16:40.115
about putting my butt on the line.

16:40.115 --> 16:42.117
How do you think the line feels?

16:45.120 --> 16:46.121
Norman...

16:46.121 --> 16:48.574
why waste time with the supervisor?

16:48.574 --> 16:51.076
He'll only take credit
for the idea himself.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.078
Why don't you go right to the top?

16:53.078 --> 16:55.330
Present your idea to
the Board of Directors.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.166
I don't know, the
thought of standing there

16:57.166 --> 17:00.169
in a room full of bigwigs
just gives me the cold sweats.

17:00.169 --> 17:02.171
Boy, yeah, I can sympathize
with you there, Normie.

17:02.171 --> 17:03.672
Yeah?

17:03.672 --> 17:05.057
Yeah, I'll never forget
my first oral report.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.476
Sixth grade. Yeah?

17:07.476 --> 17:08.977
Yeah, boy, was I nervous. I tell you.

17:08.977 --> 17:12.481
I went to my father and
he said, "Hey, just relax.

17:12.481 --> 17:14.483
"You'll be fine as long as you can

17:14.483 --> 17:16.484
imagine the other kids
in their underwear."

17:16.484 --> 17:17.986
Which was no big deal for me

17:17.986 --> 17:20.856
because I'd gotten that far with
half the girls in class already.

17:22.023 --> 17:22.858
Even then, huh?

17:22.858 --> 17:25.861
Yeah, anyway, I was, uh, just describing

17:25.861 --> 17:28.864
how they make maple syrup by
draining the sap from trees

17:28.864 --> 17:31.366
when I happened to look
down and notice how nicely

17:31.366 --> 17:33.368
Cindy Van Rippen had filled out.

17:33.368 --> 17:34.369
Ooh. Oh, yes. Ha-ha.

17:34.369 --> 17:36.371
Well, what happened next?

17:36.371 --> 17:39.374
Oh, well, I, uh, I smiled
at her and she smiled at me

17:39.374 --> 17:41.376
and then after my little speech

17:41.376 --> 17:44.263
we stole a few moments in the cloakroom.

17:44.263 --> 17:48.100
No, I mean after they drain
the sap from the trees.

17:52.187 --> 17:54.473
I don't remember, Woody.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.474
Oh, great, Sam.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.977
Get us all revved up and
then leave out the best part.

18:00.479 --> 18:03.982
Norman, nothing takes the
place of personal support.

18:03.982 --> 18:06.985
Therefore, when you're
ready to make your proposal,

18:06.985 --> 18:09.488
I will be at your side.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.956
Tell them that you've hired a personal

18:10.956 --> 18:12.825
secretary to assist
you, at your expense.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.326
Diane, please, I mean,

18:14.326 --> 18:15.828
you've been more than
helpful already, okay?

18:15.828 --> 18:17.830
I don't need anyone to hold my hand.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.331
I just need a little practice.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.332
CLIFF: Well, uh, Normie,

18:20.332 --> 18:22.835
well, why don't you, uh,
try it out on us, huh?

18:22.835 --> 18:23.836
That's a good idea actually.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.337
Oh, yes, it is good. Good, good.

18:25.337 --> 18:27.339
Stand up here so we can all see you.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.340
All right.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.341
Uh, now remember, guys,

18:29.341 --> 18:30.843
uh, this room'll be a pressure cooker,

18:30.843 --> 18:33.345
so just, uh, you know,
stay on top of me, okay?

18:33.345 --> 18:34.596
Really heckle me.

18:34.596 --> 18:36.398
It'll help.

18:36.398 --> 18:38.400
(clears throat)

18:38.400 --> 18:40.269
Good morning, gentlemen.

18:40.269 --> 18:42.688
Uh, what's good about it?

18:47.159 --> 18:49.161
What time can you be there?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.785
...enjoy a 58% growth.

18:56.785 --> 18:57.786
Cash flow.

18:57.786 --> 18:59.288
And we'll achieve it no later...

18:59.288 --> 19:00.289
Thank God.

19:00.289 --> 19:01.790
Thank God you're here.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.292
Norman, don't worry, please.

19:03.292 --> 19:04.793
Everything is going to be perfect.

19:04.793 --> 19:06.295
I hope so.

19:06.295 --> 19:08.297
I'm, uh, having a very tough time

19:08.297 --> 19:10.799
picturing the chairman of
the board in his underpants.

19:10.799 --> 19:11.800
Oh, no.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.302
What? Now what? What?

19:13.302 --> 19:16.305
Oh, Pierre forgot the
chocolate croissant I ordered.

19:16.305 --> 19:17.806
Don't worry about it.
It wasn't that good.

19:20.309 --> 19:22.311
That's a nice suit, Peterson.

19:22.311 --> 19:23.812
They make it in your size?

19:26.315 --> 19:28.317
Pay no attention to him.

19:28.317 --> 19:33.205
Norman is making a proposal
today at the board meeting.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.706
Well, he's wasting his time.

19:34.706 --> 19:36.959
Those stuffed shirts don't
care about anybody's ideas.

19:36.959 --> 19:39.795
Why don't you just have the
courage to wish him well?

19:39.795 --> 19:41.463
Why don't you take a flying leap?

19:41.463 --> 19:44.132
Touche.

19:45.801 --> 19:49.087
Now listen, I don't
like to make predictions,

19:49.087 --> 19:51.089
but you're going to be

19:51.089 --> 19:53.091
in the top echelon of
this company someday.

19:53.091 --> 19:54.593
Your idea is so good

19:54.593 --> 19:56.511
they can't help but applaud it.

19:56.511 --> 19:57.512
I hope you're right, Diane,

19:58.013 --> 19:59.514
but, uh, we have a few minutes now

19:59.514 --> 20:01.767
and I just, I wanna splash
some water on my face.

20:01.767 --> 20:03.602
Fine, fine, I'll go prepare the coffee.

20:03.602 --> 20:04.486
Okay.

20:04.486 --> 20:06.355
It's a special Viennese blend.

20:06.355 --> 20:07.856
They're bound to be impressed.

20:07.856 --> 20:08.857
Oh, great, great.

20:08.857 --> 20:10.859
For my part I think I'd like to get

20:10.859 --> 20:12.861
a second opinion on this pastry,

20:12.861 --> 20:14.363
you know what I mean?

20:25.123 --> 20:29.127
(whistling)

20:46.144 --> 20:47.529
Diane!

20:47.529 --> 20:49.314
It's-It's gone!

20:49.314 --> 20:50.816
What's gone?

20:50.816 --> 20:52.818
Well, my proposal and my career.

20:52.818 --> 20:53.819
The pastry!

20:53.819 --> 20:55.320
Oh, no.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.822
THOMPKINS: If my plan is
implemented immediately,

20:56.822 --> 20:58.323
we'll enjoy a 58%

20:58.323 --> 20:59.708
growth in cash flow.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.493
And we'll achieve it no later than

21:01.493 --> 21:02.995
the third quarter of
the next fiscal year.

21:02.995 --> 21:03.996
Thompkins. The thief.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.497
Get in there and defend yourself.

21:05.497 --> 21:06.999
Damn right I will.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.000
MAN: Thompkins, you idiot!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.885
You've completely ignored the obvious.

21:09.885 --> 21:12.804
Our resulting tax liability
would cost us a fortune.

21:12.804 --> 21:14.806
THOMPKINS: Uh, actually,
sir, it's not my plan.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.308
It's the new guy, Peterson's, you see...

21:16.308 --> 21:18.810
MAN: Don't try blaming
another man for this garbage.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.313
Now stop wasting our
time and get back to work.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.319
Just my luck.

21:27.319 --> 21:30.322
I had to share the office with a moron.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.491
Hey, sorry.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.326
MAN: I'll give him this, though.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.328
The man knows his pastry.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.836
Oh, geez.

21:44.836 --> 21:46.838
Now, Norman. Please.

21:46.838 --> 21:48.840
Now don't let this faze you.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.292
You have to keep pushing.

21:50.292 --> 21:53.462
I know that this idea didn't succeed,

21:53.462 --> 21:54.463
but others will.

21:54.463 --> 21:55.464
No, no, Diane.

21:55.464 --> 21:56.965
A few moments ago I almost made

21:57.466 --> 21:58.967
the biggest mistake of my
professional life, okay?

21:58.967 --> 22:00.852
And it was because I was doing something

22:00.852 --> 22:02.604
that just wasn't me.

22:02.604 --> 22:03.555
I am not a go-getter.

22:03.555 --> 22:05.057
I've never been a go-getter.

22:05.057 --> 22:07.059
And what's more, I don't
even want to be a go-getter.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.895
I'm very happy right where I am.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.863
And I'm tired of all
these people saying,

22:11.863 --> 22:13.115
"Peterson, you've gotta push.

22:13.115 --> 22:13.899
"You gotta get ahead.

22:13.899 --> 22:15.400
You gotta make that goal."

22:15.400 --> 22:16.902
I don't even wanna make the goal, Diane.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.403
I wanna be a bench warmer, okay?

22:18.403 --> 22:20.405
The world needs bench warmers.

22:20.405 --> 22:23.408
I mean, if there were no bench
warmers, what would we have?

22:23.408 --> 22:26.912
We'd have cold benches.
A lot of cold benches.

22:26.912 --> 22:29.164
And the world does not need that, Diane.

22:29.164 --> 22:30.999
In this great pageantry of life,

22:30.999 --> 22:34.002
Norm Peterson may be
a, a motionless lump,

22:34.002 --> 22:35.387
but he's a very damn good one.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.557
Norman, I've never
seen you so impassioned.

22:38.557 --> 22:40.675
That's 'cause I believe in this, Diane.

22:40.675 --> 22:41.843
Look, Norm Peterson

22:41.843 --> 22:44.262
is totally happy being an anonymous cog

22:44.262 --> 22:47.149
in the gigantic machinery of this firm.

22:47.149 --> 22:48.433
Oh, I forgot.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.435
Didn't you wanna say
something at the meeting?

22:50.435 --> 22:54.322
Just how delighted I was
to be part of the firm, sir.

22:54.322 --> 22:56.775
Well, we're glad to have
you aboard, Springsteen.

23:00.362 --> 23:03.165
I'm home.
