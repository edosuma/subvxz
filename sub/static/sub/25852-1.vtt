01:17.100 --> 01:21.390
<i>There was an old well
in the yard of my childhood home.</i>

01:22.800 --> 01:26.440
<i>On clear days, the waters in the well
would reflect the blue skies.</i>

01:26.440 --> 01:31.820
<i>But in the evenings, it would be
filled with an endless darkness.</i>

01:51.600 --> 01:54.100
Kang Woo! Help!

01:54.100 --> 01:55.770
Help me...

02:00.100 --> 02:02.150
Don't...

02:02.150 --> 02:04.800
Cut it off clean.

02:07.720 --> 02:12.840
Help me... Help me...

02:12.840 --> 02:14.710
Hyung Joon!

02:14.710 --> 02:16.920
- Hyung Joon.
- Here, smile.

02:17.020 --> 02:20.000
Hyung Joon!

02:20.900 --> 02:24.910
What are you doing, you bastard?

02:25.790 --> 02:27.480
Hey!

02:27.480 --> 02:29.550
Stay, wait.

02:37.100 --> 02:39.790
Don't kill anyone without my permission.

02:39.790 --> 02:41.950
Got that?

02:41.950 --> 02:45.220
- Yes.
- Take care of this.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.500
You think you'll get away with this?

02:51.630 --> 02:57.910
There are many things
you can manipulate in this world.

02:57.910 --> 03:02.740
For example, people who are
consumed by anger and disgust.

03:06.440 --> 03:09.030
What kind of nonsense is that?

03:09.030 --> 03:12.900
You better stop now.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.400
I said stop!

03:24.440 --> 03:25.710
I like that look in your eyes.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.250
Eyes filled with disgust and anger.

03:29.100 --> 03:33.850
Get mad! Come on, get more mad!

03:35.360 --> 03:39.900
Your anger will save you.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.730
Smile.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.010
You wanted to kill him, too.

03:50.010 --> 03:53.540
I just fulfilled your wish,
why are you doing this to me?

03:53.540 --> 03:57.840
Psycho bastard!
Stop it with your nonsense!

04:07.790 --> 04:09.900
I'm disappointed.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.970
I thought you would understand.

04:11.970 --> 04:13.520
Give that to me.

04:33.790 --> 04:38.470
Be grateful to me every time
you look at that scar, okay?

04:38.470 --> 04:44.100
Let's go for the ankle.
I've always wanted to have a cop's ankle.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.810
You psychopath.

04:56.810 --> 04:59.200
I'll rip you to pieces.

05:07.690 --> 05:09.270
What was that?

05:09.270 --> 05:12.050
Did somebody fall in?

05:12.050 --> 05:13.460
- Boss!
- Yeah!

05:13.460 --> 05:14.600
Let's go over there!

05:14.600 --> 05:18.780
- I'll pull him up.
- Shut up, and stay still.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.270
There's a boat over there.

05:26.270 --> 05:30.400
Hello? Yes, someone fell in the water.

05:42.950 --> 05:48.530
<i>You may be a jerk, but I like you
because you get the bad guys.</i>

05:49.370 --> 05:52.640
What are cops for?
We just need to get the bad guys.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.700
No?

05:58.990 --> 06:03.490
<i>My dad would say that everyone
has a well within themselves.</i>

06:03.490 --> 06:09.110
<i>And if one looks too deep into
that well, he can lose himself in it.</i>

06:11.310 --> 06:14.200
<i>Those forgotten words
came back to me like a blade.</i>

06:16.100 --> 06:18.290
<i>And I finally understood.</i>

06:20.260 --> 06:24.690
<i>I was met with
the most terrifying well today.</i>

06:26.290 --> 06:33.640
<i>A well reeking of
rotting hatred and anger.</i>

06:49.740 --> 06:52.110

It's called C-4, an explosive
used to blow up buildings.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.830
It can destroy everything
within a 10 meter radius.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.490
Sir.

09:28.490 --> 09:33.370
There are claustrophobic passengers
on the train cars that are on standby.

09:34.290 --> 09:35.970
What about Captain Jang?

09:35.970 --> 09:38.480
He was off, he's on his way.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.170
<i>Bring her now!</i>

09:40.170 --> 09:41.970
This is insane.

09:41.970 --> 09:46.040
Inside the Seongun Samsu Station,
a suspect covered in dynamite

09:46.040 --> 09:49.510
is taking a passenger as hostage and
having a confrontation with the police.

09:49.510 --> 09:53.640
According to the police,
the suspect has not been identified, yet.

09:53.640 --> 09:58.210
<i>He is making an absurd demand to
bring the woman who cursed at him.</i>

09:58.210 --> 10:01.300
<i>Fortunately, there is no news
of any casualties as of yet.</i>

10:18.290 --> 10:21.190
I'm Detective Park Joon Ki

10:21.190 --> 10:25.770
Let's open up,
and talk about this.

10:25.770 --> 10:28.200
You bring that bitch!

10:28.200 --> 10:31.680
- Otherwise, I'll kill everyone!
- No, just hold on!

10:31.680 --> 10:34.460
Okay, I'll go bring her.

10:34.460 --> 10:36.490
Get lost!

10:36.490 --> 10:38.760
Stop moving.

10:39.830 --> 10:43.300
Special forces have been called,
and the snipers are in place.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.890
What should we do?

10:45.760 --> 10:47.300
Hold on.

10:48.470 --> 10:50.000
<i>Please help...</i>

10:50.000 --> 10:52.990
Two of the hostages are students
from a nearby university.

10:52.990 --> 10:55.250
We're still trying to identify
the rest of the hostages.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.760
We're figuring out where the suspect
got on, but we need more time.

10:58.760 --> 11:03.490
It's a simple dynamite,
and it won't be hard to deactivate.

11:03.540 --> 11:05.810
The problem is how we'll
approach the suspect.

11:05.810 --> 11:07.390
Joon Hwan, Director Kang.

11:07.390 --> 11:12.140
The snipers are in place, what do we do?
Will you talk to him through the speaker?

11:12.140 --> 11:14.930
Hold on, we're trying to
identify the suspect.

11:14.930 --> 11:17.170
Captain Jang is not there, yet?

11:17.170 --> 11:19.000
It's insane.

11:21.610 --> 11:23.630
<i>[Captain Jang Kyung Hak]</i>

11:29.340 --> 11:31.930
Do as I say.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.850
Something urgent came up,
so I need to go somewhere.

11:38.850 --> 11:40.760
<i>I can't talk.</i>

11:40.760 --> 11:42.040
Captain...

11:42.040 --> 11:43.990
Good.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.040
You psychopath.

11:47.980 --> 11:49.850
<i>Let us go...</i>

11:49.850 --> 11:52.090
<i>- Let us go.
- Stop!</i>

11:52.090 --> 11:54.700
<i>You're cursing me out, too?</i>

11:54.700 --> 11:57.660
<i>I heard you. I heard it all!</i>

11:57.660 --> 12:01.560
You said you would bring her!
Why did you lie?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.060
<i>His anger is out of control.</i>

12:04.060 --> 12:05.580
<i>And he's not making any sense.</i>

12:05.580 --> 12:09.940
<i>And he's claiming to hear voices
in his head that are demeaning him.</i>

12:09.940 --> 12:12.210
<i>Could he be schizophrenic?</i>

12:12.210 --> 12:13.220
Director Kang.

12:13.220 --> 12:16.360
We confirmed the suspect got on the train
at Chunggak Station 10 minutes ago.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.610
He uses that station often.

12:20.650 --> 12:22.800
Call the health center at Chunggak.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.490
Ask if any residents were prescribed
medicine for a mental illness.

12:25.490 --> 12:27.470
And check the records
from the patrol division.

12:27.470 --> 12:30.330
Director Kang, I found something
from the patrol division.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.860
Name, Kang Doo Won. Age, 27.

12:32.860 --> 12:35.970
Lives in a half-basement room at
Chungmuk Villa in Chunggak, on welfare.

12:35.970 --> 12:37.530
On May 23 and May 31

12:37.530 --> 12:40.800
he was involved in a physical assault
with another resident at the villa.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.240
He's been taking Rivotril
for schizophrenia.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.440
But he hasn't been prescribed
any since two weeks ago.

12:45.440 --> 12:49.670
It seems he didn't receive checks,
and couldn't pay for the medicine.

12:55.220 --> 12:59.680
I bet you want to know
why I brought you here.

13:02.890 --> 13:09.630
When I see people laughing like that,
I want to rip off their mouths.

13:11.490 --> 13:16.160
They're so stupid laughing like that,
not knowing how screwed up the world is.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.690
That man in the red hiking suit.

13:22.690 --> 13:25.100
He's a retired principal.

13:25.100 --> 13:29.710
He's very excited about going on a trip
abroad with his wife for the first time.

13:29.710 --> 13:33.000
And the man next to him is unemployed.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.200
It won't be easy to find another job at
his age, but still he keeps carrying on.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.990
That couple there...

13:42.990 --> 13:46.930
He's just passed the civil service exam,
so they're getting married.

13:46.930 --> 13:52.260
Nice times...
Getting married and starting a family...

13:53.410 --> 13:57.890
Those people have never
done any wrong to anyone...

13:57.890 --> 14:02.530
You'll just run them over,
and drop off the cliff...

14:03.380 --> 14:06.930
What? You want to say something?

14:09.380 --> 14:11.290
Psycho bastard...

14:12.200 --> 14:15.110
You think you can change
anything by doing this?

14:16.560 --> 14:19.390
You talk too much.

14:19.390 --> 14:25.050
Hey, you can't even help your own self.
Stop trying to help others.

14:37.390 --> 14:42.160
You scumbag, if you try to
take out your anger this way

14:42.160 --> 14:44.700
you think the world
will become dirty like you?

14:44.700 --> 14:50.720
No! Even if I die here,
another cop will stop you.

14:50.720 --> 14:55.560
And you'll continue
to live as rotting trash.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.770
Shut up, jerk!

15:07.480 --> 15:11.710
That's right, I almost forgot.

15:11.710 --> 15:15.840
Hold on, there's somebody
who wants to have an ear.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.230
Bastard!

16:05.010 --> 16:07.570
Damn it, it's raining.

17:05.349 --> 17:07.780
Bastard, he turned the wheel.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.670
<i>Bastard, he turned the wheel.</i>

17:12.369 --> 17:14.180
What?

17:31.020 --> 17:32.550
What is he doing?

17:32.550 --> 17:34.960
<i>- Jerk, why did you turn the wheel?
- You've got no time.</i>

17:37.110 --> 17:39.390
<i>Hey!</i>

17:44.980 --> 17:48.710
- There's a car coming.
- Push the car off the cliff now.

17:50.840 --> 17:55.090
<i>Don't leave behind any evidence, got it?</i>

17:59.190 --> 18:02.800
Detective, the suspect has been confirmed
as suffering from schizophrenia.

18:02.800 --> 18:06.200
He's 27, and his delusions worsened
because he's been off meds.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.290
What kind of illness is that?

18:08.290 --> 18:11.890
The suspect may push the button,
he's using the hostage as a shield

18:11.890 --> 18:14.220
so we can't shoot.

18:15.470 --> 18:19.130
<i>We need to get more time.</i>

18:19.130 --> 18:22.300
<i>Yeah, I should address his delusions.</i>

18:23.100 --> 18:24.750
Let's all die here.

18:24.750 --> 18:28.170
I'll get rid of everyone
who ever degraded me.

18:28.170 --> 18:32.420
Yeah, I can do that.
Right now, I'll do it...

18:32.420 --> 18:35.000
Right now, I'll get rid of you all!

18:36.640 --> 18:40.670
<i>- He can't even press that.
- I should just grab it out.</i>

18:40.670 --> 18:42.710
<i>Why is he such a coward?</i>

18:45.530 --> 18:47.590
I'll get rid of you all!

18:52.600 --> 18:54.300
<i>Mr. Kang Doo Won.</i>

18:55.500 --> 18:59.640
The voices you are hearing
right now aren't real.

18:59.640 --> 19:01.480
Who are you?

19:01.480 --> 19:05.020
<i>If you throw down that switch,
you won't hear the voices anymore.</i>

19:05.020 --> 19:07.510
They won't bother you anymore.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.090
Lies!

19:15.300 --> 19:18.210
I know you'll belittle me, too.

19:18.210 --> 19:20.020
Listen carefully, Mr. Kang Doo Won.

19:20.020 --> 19:22.960
I'll tell you how you can
get rid of that voice.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.040
Let those people go first.

19:25.040 --> 19:30.720
Then we can look at the CCTV files
to find that woman who cursed at you.

19:30.720 --> 19:32.010
And if she really exists

19:32.010 --> 19:36.240
I'll make sure she apologizes
and never does that to you again.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.070
<i>You promise that?</i>

19:40.070 --> 19:42.600
You'll make her apologize...

19:42.600 --> 19:44.430
No!

19:47.390 --> 19:51.220
There's no other way.
I need to do this...

19:51.220 --> 19:53.950
to get rid of the voice.

20:06.100 --> 20:10.000
There's no other way.
I need to do this...

20:10.000 --> 20:12.990
to get rid of the voice.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.990
Detective Park, the wires.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.110
Now.

20:49.600 --> 20:52.070
<i>Everyone out!</i>

21:00.960 --> 21:03.420
They cursed at me first!

21:03.420 --> 21:07.000
<i>They humiliated me first!</i>

21:07.000 --> 21:09.530
What are you saying?
Nobody did anything to you!

21:09.530 --> 21:12.500
How can you do this?

21:12.500 --> 21:17.820
You are under arrest for assault
and taking hostages.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.950
You have the right to an attorney,
and the right to represent yourself.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.600
This is the scene of the crime.

21:29.600 --> 21:33.010
The suspect for the bombing attempt
at Samsu Station has been arrested.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.750
The rescue was a success!

21:34.750 --> 21:38.000
Thank you, please continue
to focus on your duties.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.410
[June 2, 2018, 5:20 p.m.]

21:46.410 --> 21:50.710
<i>[Samsu Station hostage case
closed in 20 minutes]</i>

21:57.040 --> 21:58.380
Thank you.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.380
<i>Not at all.</i>

22:00.380 --> 22:04.320
<i>You said he's schizophrenic,
but where did he get the explosives?</i>

22:04.320 --> 22:06.830
You can find anything
on the internet these days.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.670
What a world...

22:08.670 --> 22:13.700
Anyway, Captain Jang
is going to be so upset tomorrow.

22:13.700 --> 22:18.610
He's been wanting to show off to
the reporters how hard our team works.

22:18.610 --> 22:22.800
I know, if he were there, he would
have made a big deal, too bad.

22:22.800 --> 22:27.560
But, you beautiful Director Kang...
There's nothing for us today?

22:27.560 --> 22:31.830
You know, we worked so hard
and closed the case...

22:31.830 --> 22:33.300
Why are you acting dumb?

22:33.300 --> 22:37.910
On days like today,
we need to eat some good meat...

22:37.910 --> 22:39.860
Detective Park, nice shot.

22:39.860 --> 22:42.330
- We should go out to eat.
- Yeah.

22:42.330 --> 22:44.970
Captain Jang's not here today,
so let's pass on it for now.

22:44.970 --> 22:47.920
We can go tomorrow.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.940
Okay.

22:52.870 --> 22:56.230
Something urgent came up,
so I need to go somewhere.

22:56.230 --> 22:58.080
I can't talk.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.040
<i>[Captain Jang Kyung Hak]</i>

23:06.820 --> 23:12.200
<i>The recipient's phone is turned off,
please leave a message after the beep...</i>

23:15.720 --> 23:19.360
Agent Park, can you track the
location of Captain Jang's cell phone?

23:19.360 --> 23:22.120
- We have an app for that, right?
- Track his location?

23:22.120 --> 23:24.050
Yeah, something's bothering me.

23:24.050 --> 23:25.620
Sure.

23:31.560 --> 23:35.740
It's saying that it's impossible
to track Captain Jang.

23:37.190 --> 23:39.550
The last location was Mount Gang Oh.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.880
Check the CCTVs to track
Captain Jang's movements.

23:48.530 --> 23:50.510
There's nothing captured
near Samsu Station.

23:50.510 --> 23:53.090
Nothing near his home, either.

23:57.390 --> 23:58.900
Director Kang.

23:58.900 --> 24:03.360
It's a call from the Poongsan
Police Station, you should get it.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.480
Yes, this is Kang Kwon Joo.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.800
What?

24:12.800 --> 24:14.690
Are you sure?

24:15.800 --> 24:19.270
So, the captain of Golden Time Team

24:19.270 --> 24:22.800
hit a group of hikers with his car,
and has died himself?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.650
Yes.

24:25.720 --> 24:29.830
That's what a female survivor
said to the emergency crew.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.300
And it looks like the car
fell down the cliff.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.120
Seriously...

24:37.770 --> 24:43.110
How can a cop kill civilians?

24:43.110 --> 24:45.610
<i>Hong Soo, take care of this.</i>

24:45.620 --> 24:49.330
If word gets out it was another cop from
our district, you know what will happen?

24:49.330 --> 24:53.920
Yes, I'll try my best
to keep things quiet.

24:56.680 --> 24:58.390
Hello, Sir.

24:58.390 --> 25:01.320
- What's going on?
- According to the forensics team

25:01.320 --> 25:06.040
the blood sample from the car seat
came out positive for a drug test.

25:06.040 --> 25:12.250
And this is the deceased suspect's file,
looks like he was a great detective.

25:12.250 --> 25:16.320
Why would a great captain do this?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.370
What's the motive?

25:17.370 --> 25:20.200
Being that he was the captain
of a rescue call center

25:20.200 --> 25:23.800
we're suspecting a serious case of PTSD.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.130
This is going to be a big headache.

25:26.870 --> 25:30.890
<i>Yes, Detective Park.
I'm on my way, too.</i>

25:30.890 --> 25:33.190
When I spoke to Captain Jang before...

25:33.190 --> 25:35.700
I should have figured out
what was going on.

25:35.700 --> 25:41.510
- I'm at fault.
- No, this has to be a misunderstanding.

25:41.510 --> 25:46.160
He wouldn't have done this.
You know that, too.

25:49.960 --> 25:53.120
Whose daughter is this pretty girl?

25:54.600 --> 25:56.650
- Captain.
- Yeah.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.850
You're that happy about
Yeo Wool coming back home?

26:00.850 --> 26:03.280
Of course, I'm happy.

26:03.280 --> 26:08.330
You know I'm off tomorrow, right?
Don't you even think about calling me.

26:08.330 --> 26:11.690
Let me please eat out
with my family for once.

26:11.690 --> 26:15.560
Don't worry, I don't want to
hear your wife complain, either.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.120
Thanks.

26:20.100 --> 26:25.610
Anyway, how is the process going for
picking out the new call center location?

26:25.610 --> 26:29.520
Good, we're looking for the area
that most needs our help.

26:29.520 --> 26:34.110
No matter where you decide,
I'm going there.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.990
What?

26:38.990 --> 26:41.270
Jin Hyuk will be mad at me if I don't.

26:41.270 --> 26:45.180
He begged me to take care
of the team before he left.

27:10.240 --> 27:11.760
<i>This is Team 0-1.</i>

27:11.760 --> 27:14.800
<i>An officer from Seongun Station
drove a car into a group of hikers.</i>

27:14.800 --> 27:17.590
<i>Three of the four hikers
were killed on the spot.</i>

27:17.590 --> 27:20.280
<i>In the suspect's car were
a gift box, a disposable camera</i>

27:20.280 --> 27:23.440
<i>a police ID, and cigarettes.</i>

27:23.440 --> 27:25.110
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

27:25.110 --> 27:27.230
That cop must have been crazy.

27:31.070 --> 27:38.040
I'm getting this feeling that
we'll get something this time.

27:41.020 --> 27:43.810
You need to put this on. Hey, wait.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.790
Wait...

27:51.650 --> 27:55.100
- You can't come in.
- We're from Seungun Police Station.

27:55.100 --> 28:02.570
We were very close to
the deceased, we'll be quick.

28:02.570 --> 28:04.400
We'll be quick.

28:04.400 --> 28:09.170
We need to be quick
and go before the police arrive.

28:09.170 --> 28:13.010
We can't get caught.
I'll be on the lookout.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.160
<i>Cut it off clean.</i>

29:18.300 --> 29:22.880
<i>Let's go for the ankle.
I've always wanted to have a cop's ankle.</i>

29:29.690 --> 29:31.190
It's him.

29:32.360 --> 29:34.560
He's come back.

29:43.690 --> 29:47.390
<i>Just like three years ago,
he used someone to commit murder.</i>

29:48.920 --> 29:51.630
<i>And he's taken a body part as a trophy.</i>

29:53.100 --> 29:56.750
<i>The only difference from then
is that his accomplice made a mistake.</i>

30:18.160 --> 30:20.650
<i>Where has he run to?</i>

30:20.650 --> 30:23.090
- You have the file from the dash cam?
- Yes, here.

30:23.090 --> 30:25.410
There was nobody else around?

30:25.410 --> 30:28.850
- No, nobody else.
- Thank you for your cooperation.

30:39.040 --> 30:43.860
The police cars are here.
The detectives are here.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.120
I'm the director of
the Seungun Police 911 call center.

31:02.120 --> 31:07.130
- We need to check something.
- Yes, the body's damaged from the crash.

31:10.250 --> 31:12.220
Kyung Hak.

31:15.630 --> 31:18.040
Who do you think you are? Move.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.400
I'm the Chief of Seungun Police.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.230
You won't cooperate?
Move while I'm still talking nice.

31:22.230 --> 31:25.900
It's a matter of time before Chairman Oh
gets himself out, let's get him at once.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.600
Yes, Sir!

31:28.690 --> 31:30.280
Who did this?

31:31.500 --> 31:34.860
Who the heck did this?

31:36.090 --> 31:39.100
Where is that bastard?

31:39.100 --> 31:41.450
Sir...

31:46.690 --> 31:49.240
Can we zip him back up?

32:00.360 --> 32:04.250
It seems that your captain
overdosed on sedatives and drove.

32:04.250 --> 32:08.330
Perhaps he was stressed
with the pressures of his work.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.080
Our captain would never
overdose on sedatives.

32:15.010 --> 32:17.310
Yes.

32:17.310 --> 32:20.440
This note was found inside his car.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.280
Looks like he worked without
a single day off after returning to work.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.500
It's not an easy job
to save lives in 10 minutes.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.160
Looks like you're trying to close
this as a drug overdose case.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.820
Shouldn't you see if it was
the rain or a vehicle malfunction?

32:32.820 --> 32:37.350
Director Kang, we're all cops here.
You don't think we checked that?

32:37.350 --> 32:40.900
It's clear that he intentionally
tried to hit them.

32:40.900 --> 32:44.070
No, we won't accept that.
We request a joint investigation.

32:44.070 --> 32:45.910
Please search the site.

32:45.910 --> 32:48.400
- I'll go look for evidence.
- Okay.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.430
It's because you're so uptight
that your partner did this.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.530
Agent Park.

32:52.530 --> 32:55.790
See if anyone had a grudge against
the captain or if he had money problems.

32:55.790 --> 32:58.020
And check his medical records.

33:08.250 --> 33:11.960
We need to go, they're all coming in.

33:29.580 --> 33:31.560
Yes.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.890
Kwon Joo...

33:35.890 --> 33:41.000
I heard my husband was in an accident.
What's going on?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.730
<i>It's not true, right?</i>

33:44.730 --> 33:47.740
I'll get back to you when
the situation's a little clearer.

33:47.740 --> 33:50.540
Please wait a little.

34:01.990 --> 34:04.200
Wait, who are you?

34:04.200 --> 34:06.500
I'm a detective from
Poongsan Police Station.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.330
- They asked me to bring this.
- Show me your ID.

34:09.330 --> 34:11.260
- I'm busy.
- Stop right there.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.110
You're not a detective from Poongsan.

34:14.110 --> 34:16.760
What did you put in your pocket?

34:16.760 --> 34:20.440
I found someone stealing evidence
and pretending to be a cop.

34:24.360 --> 34:27.570
Look, I'm in a hurry.

34:27.570 --> 34:30.080
There was something installed
in your captain's car.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.550
The accomplice who ran away
must be captured in this video.

34:33.550 --> 34:36.080
- If you don't believe me, look...
- Stop moving.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.340
Who are you?

34:39.310 --> 34:41.739
Excuse me.

34:46.969 --> 34:50.690
How dare you come here?

34:51.870 --> 34:55.340
- What were you doing letting him in?
- Please stop!

34:55.340 --> 34:59.240
There is evidence in there
to catch the culprit.

34:59.240 --> 35:01.250
If we go now, we can get him.

35:01.250 --> 35:05.150
The same bastard from three years ago
used someone to commit murder...

35:05.150 --> 35:08.730
and told him to bring
that ear back as a gift.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.490
- Damn...
- Who is he?

35:11.490 --> 35:15.300
His name is Do Kang Woo, a
detective from Poongsan Police.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.870
He's a suspect in the police murder
at Sokpo Beach three years ago.

35:18.870 --> 35:22.400
He was released for lack of evidence,
and he's on leave now.

35:22.400 --> 35:24.030
- A suspect?
- Yes.

35:25.690 --> 35:29.200
You're the director of
the Golden Time Team, right?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.600
You must know, then.

35:30.600 --> 35:33.440
If you don't go after him now,
you'll never get him.

35:33.440 --> 35:36.250
You want me to believe someone
who tried to steal evidence?

35:38.010 --> 35:40.280
Damn...

35:40.630 --> 35:43.440
Your colleague is dead,
and that's all you can say?

35:43.440 --> 35:46.720
- What is this bastard saying?
- Hold on.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.290
Then let's check the file
from the dashboard camera.

35:49.290 --> 35:51.790
Can we take a look?

35:53.400 --> 35:57.110
What are you doing?
The lady wants to see it.

35:57.110 --> 35:59.110
Yes.

36:05.610 --> 36:07.840
We don't see anything.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.740
Are you happy now?

36:12.290 --> 36:14.000
What was it?

36:14.000 --> 36:17.780
You heard there was
a gift box left at the scene

36:17.780 --> 36:19.500
and wanted to use that to return to work?

36:19.500 --> 36:21.170
Stop dreaming, you bastard!

36:21.170 --> 36:25.400
I'm not putting you away
for stealing evidence.

36:25.400 --> 36:29.730
I'll be putting you away for murder!

36:29.730 --> 36:32.600
Psycho idiot!

36:33.780 --> 36:36.110
- Hey.
- Come with us.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.390
Let go!

36:37.390 --> 36:39.960
Forget it, I'll get him myself.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.290
I'll get him without your help.

36:43.100 --> 36:48.790
If you call yourselves cops,
at least check the victim's shoe soles.

36:48.790 --> 36:51.090
You blind fools.

36:52.470 --> 36:55.720
- What the hell...
- That bastard...

37:03.460 --> 37:05.460
Damn.

37:10.330 --> 37:14.900
How could you drop that behind?
You stupid fool.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.900
He attacked me out of nowhere,
what was I supposed to do?

37:17.900 --> 37:21.580
And I told you not to call me stupid!

37:21.580 --> 37:22.720
Stop!

37:22.720 --> 37:24.450
Fine, I'm sorry.

37:25.570 --> 37:29.220
<i>You hid it well?</i>

37:30.440 --> 37:32.930
It dropped from a cliff,
they won't find it.

37:32.930 --> 37:35.300
There's no time,
why are you making me do this?

37:35.300 --> 37:38.970
<i>If you left evidence behind at the scene,
and the cops come after you?</i>

37:38.970 --> 37:43.080
If you hold onto that key,
there's so much that can go wrong.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.580
- You got that?
- Fine, sorry.

37:50.300 --> 37:54.030
I'm doing this for you.

37:54.030 --> 37:56.070
<i>So just do as I say.</i>

37:56.070 --> 37:58.190
- Got it?
<i>- Fine.</i>

37:58.190 --> 38:03.440
I did as you said.
Next time, I won't forget the gift.

38:22.290 --> 38:23.790
- Dok Ki.
- Yeah?

38:23.790 --> 38:26.490
You said you know someone from
the Road Traffic Authority, right?

38:26.490 --> 38:30.830
Find out if any cars left Mount Gang Oh
between five and six.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.430
- There must be hundreds of cars...
- Just do it!

38:37.810 --> 38:39.940
Okay.

38:39.940 --> 38:41.480
I can't believe this...

38:41.480 --> 38:44.130
A murderer disguised as a detective...

38:44.130 --> 38:48.830
That's why we need to run a personality
assessment before picking cops...

38:54.750 --> 38:57.450
What's this? Is this a skid mark?

38:58.500 --> 39:01.190
It does look like a tire mark

39:01.190 --> 39:04.430
but we'll need to analyze
it to see if it's a skid mark.

39:04.590 --> 39:06.790
There was something installed
in your captain's car.

39:06.790 --> 39:10.880
If you call yourselves cops,
at least check the victim's shoe soles.

39:11.010 --> 39:13.660
You blind fools.

39:15.080 --> 39:21.790
If this is a skid mark, that means
Captain tried to stop the car.

39:21.790 --> 39:25.900
So, if someone installed
an accelerator on his car

39:25.900 --> 39:28.100
and injected the drug
into Captain Jang...

39:28.100 --> 39:31.440
I've heard of a case like that...

39:32.580 --> 39:34.600
If you check the driver's shoe soles

39:34.600 --> 39:36.780
can you see if he stepped
on the accelerator abruptly?

39:36.780 --> 39:38.760
It's not impossible, but...

39:40.080 --> 39:41.610
- Captain!
- Yeah.

39:41.610 --> 39:43.270
Hold on.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.320
Oh, yeah, that's possible.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.240
If the driver stepped
on the brake urgently

39:51.240 --> 39:56.400
the heat would leave
the brake pedal's mark on the soles.

39:56.400 --> 40:00.000
If he had stepped on the accelerator,
it would have left that mark on his shoe.

40:02.400 --> 40:03.850
Thank you.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.420
<i>The same bastard from three years ago
used someone to commit murder</i>

40:18.420 --> 40:22.710
and told him to bring
that ear back as a gift.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.320
- Detective Park.
- Yes.

40:25.320 --> 40:27.490
I need to check
the witness's dash cam, hurry.

40:27.490 --> 40:28.690
Okay.

40:30.830 --> 40:33.770
Here it is.

40:38.350 --> 40:41.070
<i>What happened?</i>

40:41.530 --> 40:43.180
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

40:43.440 --> 40:45.080
<i>What's this?</i>

40:45.080 --> 40:47.930
<i>It's very faint, but...</i>

40:47.930 --> 40:55.130
<i>It's the sound of big, heavy chains,
all clanking together.</i>

40:55.970 --> 40:59.560
<i>I know I've heard this sound before.</i>

40:59.560 --> 41:01.890
<i>Where did I hear it before?</i>

41:02.700 --> 41:04.930
<i>Wait...</i>

41:04.930 --> 41:07.130
Something urgent came up,
so I need to go somewhere.

41:07.130 --> 41:08.910
I can't talk.

41:11.690 --> 41:15.270
<i>The first sound was duller,
but now it sounds lighter.</i>

41:15.270 --> 41:18.250
<i>What is this sound?</i>

41:19.410 --> 41:23.290
<i>Is it a tow truck?</i>

41:23.290 --> 41:28.020
<i>Yeah, the sound came from the chains
clanking together on a tow truck.</i>

41:28.020 --> 41:31.030
<i>The first dull sound was from
Captain Jang's car being towed.</i>

41:31.030 --> 41:35.090
<i>And the lighter sound in the video
was because the tow truck was on its own.</i>

41:35.090 --> 41:37.920
<i>Detective Do Kang Woo was right.</i>

41:37.920 --> 41:42.810
<i>Whoever towed
Captain Jang's car here did this.</i>

41:44.830 --> 41:49.160
I think there's another suspect
to Captain Jang's case.

41:49.160 --> 41:52.040
The suspect is a tow truck driver,
and may have an accomplice.

41:52.040 --> 41:54.920
Check the CCTV files from 5 p.m.
to 6 p.m. at Mount Gang Ho

41:54.920 --> 41:56.400
<i>and look for a tow truck.</i>

41:58.010 --> 41:59.830
Everyone heard, right?

41:59.830 --> 42:01.780
We're going into emergency mode.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.600
Yes.

42:03.600 --> 42:05.790
<i>And look into Detective Do Kang Woo.</i>

42:05.790 --> 42:06.920
Sure.

42:06.920 --> 42:09.220
The police murder case
in Sokpo three years back.

42:09.220 --> 42:13.650
Director, Captain Jang's accident
was a misunderstanding, right?

42:13.650 --> 42:18.500
Yeah, I think someone
is committing horrible deeds.

42:18.500 --> 42:22.840
Agent Jin, look into the case
from three years ago and Do Kang Woo.

42:22.840 --> 42:25.330
- Search everything thoroughly.
- Sure.

42:35.360 --> 42:37.390
<i>Around 50 cars?</i>

42:37.390 --> 42:39.540
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

42:40.460 --> 42:44.740
I found out for you, there were around
50 cars that left around that time.

42:44.740 --> 42:47.930
And there was a tow truck
without a license plate.

42:47.930 --> 42:49.700
A tow truck.

42:49.700 --> 42:52.540
<i>I was wondering
where he hid his vehicle.</i>

42:52.540 --> 42:55.580
<i>He must have used
a tow truck to come and go.</i>

42:55.580 --> 42:59.530
Dok Ki, go get that
tow truck right now.

42:59.620 --> 43:00.840
Okay.

43:01.660 --> 43:03.600
The suspect was driving a tow truck.

43:03.600 --> 43:06.100
I'll explain more later,
let's track him down first.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.100
Okay.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.910
And just like Detective Do said,
this may not be his first crime.

43:11.910 --> 43:15.110
It could be a calculated serial murder.

43:15.110 --> 43:16.940
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

43:22.310 --> 43:24.590
What's with them?

43:24.590 --> 43:26.280
Where are they going?

43:27.170 --> 43:30.160
Do they really believe that idiot?

43:33.430 --> 43:35.500
<i>Okay.</i>

43:36.400 --> 43:39.870
<i>They've lost track of him
since he's left the mountain.</i>

43:41.580 --> 43:44.940
Then ask around and find out
which roads don't have CCTVs.

43:44.940 --> 43:46.170
What?

43:46.900 --> 43:49.540
Who would know that?

43:50.990 --> 43:54.580
Yeah, I have something
urgent to ask you.

43:54.580 --> 43:56.750
I'm on Mount Gang Oh Road.

43:56.750 --> 44:00.530
Which way do I go if I want to
get on a road without a CCTV?

44:01.130 --> 44:04.320
Oh, okay. Go to sleep.

44:05.030 --> 44:08.730
He says he probably
got off for Sokpo from Route 45.

44:09.920 --> 44:12.760
- Dok Ki, a shortcut!
- Okay.

44:15.100 --> 44:18.460
<i>You're so brilliant.</i>

44:18.460 --> 44:21.060
How do you know so much?

44:21.060 --> 44:27.290
<i>Dok Ki, when I just see the scene of
a crime, I can read the bastard's mind.</i>

44:28.690 --> 44:30.670
But strangely, not him.

44:30.670 --> 44:33.590
The only reason I got this far is because
the accomplice made a mistake.

44:33.590 --> 44:37.270
- I can't let him get away.
- Okay.

44:37.270 --> 44:43.810
<i>Just like you said, any pervert who
does that to someone should be locked up.</i>

44:48.710 --> 44:53.190
<i>Director, there was only one tow truck
that was on the video between 5 and 6.</i>

44:53.190 --> 44:56.540
With a covered-up license plate,
he went onto Route 45.

44:56.540 --> 44:58.960
But there are no CCTVs,
so we can't track him.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.900
- What?
- Fortunately, Agent Jin checked the name

45:01.900 --> 45:05.940
and when we called, they said it was
rented a few days ago with a fake ID.

45:05.940 --> 45:07.660
I've sent you the file.

45:08.860 --> 45:11.600
It's the man
with the black cap in the photo.

45:11.600 --> 45:16.020
We couldn't see his face,
but he had a tattoo on his wrist.

45:16.020 --> 45:21.320
He might be a former tow truck driver,
and a pretty clever one at that.

45:21.320 --> 45:25.680
If he made an accelerator and installed
it on the car, he could be a car expert.

45:25.680 --> 45:28.690
You think he has an accomplice?

45:28.690 --> 45:32.420
We have no choice but to
believe that detective at this point.

45:33.900 --> 45:38.350
From the recently arrested,
find people who work in the car industry.

45:38.350 --> 45:39.700
Yes, sure.

45:52.730 --> 45:54.100
<i>I found someone.</i>

45:54.100 --> 45:56.790
<i>Kwon Suk Il, age 35.
Employee at a car center.</i>

45:56.790 --> 45:59.420
On June 19th,
he had a knife fight with a friend.

45:59.420 --> 46:00.900
<i>And Jang Soo Bok, age 40.</i>

46:00.900 --> 46:04.220
Last September while driving a tow truck,
he got into a fight with another driver.

46:04.220 --> 46:06.540
He was arrested for
assaulting the cop at the scene.

46:06.540 --> 46:08.690
<i>And he left on parole
two months ago.</i>

46:08.690 --> 46:11.290
He moved to Poongsan recently.

46:11.290 --> 46:14.020
Jang Soo Bok?
Jang Soo Bok...

46:14.020 --> 46:17.140
I think he had a tattoo.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.360
Yeah, that's right.
You don't remember?

46:20.360 --> 46:23.640
That punk who almost killed
a cop with a chain.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.400
With a chain?

46:25.400 --> 46:27.780
Oh, yeah. I remember.

46:28.380 --> 46:31.420
Don't come near me!

46:31.420 --> 46:33.920
He called me stupid first.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.100
You think I'm stupid?

46:35.100 --> 46:37.480
- Don't come near me.
- Okay, okay.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.670
Calm down. What's wrong?

46:39.670 --> 46:43.350
- You shouldn't do this to a cop.
- Shut up!

46:43.350 --> 46:45.780
Shut your mouth, and stop showing off!

46:45.780 --> 46:50.020
- Okay...
- I can't stand you people!

46:50.090 --> 46:53.820
<i>He was so angry I thought for sure
he had some underlying issues.</i>

46:53.820 --> 46:56.520
Agent Jin, find out everything
about Jang Soo Bok.

46:56.520 --> 46:59.200
Check his internet searches,
and what he does in his spare time.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.660
Okay.

47:05.940 --> 47:07.110
What's this?

47:07.110 --> 47:10.650
Director, I went into
a website he visits often.

47:10.650 --> 47:12.460
His username is "Giant Hornet."

47:12.460 --> 47:14.470
<i>The same as that tattoo on the wrist.</i>

47:14.470 --> 47:17.420
<i>When he was arrested,
his Filipino wife ran away</i>

47:17.420 --> 47:20.160
<i>and he lost his job
as a tow truck driver.</i>

47:20.160 --> 47:22.040
But that's not all.

47:22.040 --> 47:24.160
He's a gold member
of this website called "Stab."

47:24.160 --> 47:28.150
He put up a post called,
"10 Ways to Smash a Cop's Head."

47:28.150 --> 47:31.960
It explains in detail how to
kill a cop using a device he made.

47:31.960 --> 47:34.190
<i>He says he'll kill anyone
who messes with him.</i>

47:34.190 --> 47:36.160
He's a complete lunatic.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.810
And that Detective Do Kang Woo
you asked about...

47:38.810 --> 47:41.600
He was famous in Poongsan
for being a great detective.

47:42.350 --> 47:45.880
<i>After becoming a suspect in
his partner Na Hyung Joon's murder case</i>

47:45.880 --> 47:50.290
<i>his relationship to his older brother,
Chief Na Hong Soo, rapidly deteriorated.</i>

47:50.290 --> 47:52.500
I'm not putting you away
for stealing evidence.

47:52.500 --> 47:56.340
I'll be putting you away for murder!

47:57.940 --> 48:00.000
Thanks. Find out more.

48:04.290 --> 48:07.190
<i>Chief Na. This is Kang Kwon Joo.</i>

48:07.190 --> 48:10.760
We just got the data on Jang Soo Bok,
a suspect in Captain Jang's murder.

48:10.760 --> 48:14.420
Please go to 45-1 Greentel
in Opo-ro, Opo-gu.

48:14.420 --> 48:16.300
What is this nonsense?

48:16.300 --> 48:18.190
<i>We have enough evidence to suspect him.</i>

48:18.190 --> 48:22.520
If we lose him because of your team,
you'll have to take responsibility.

48:25.510 --> 48:27.190
Is that a threat?

48:27.190 --> 48:29.290
It's not a threat,
I'm asking for your cooperation.

48:29.290 --> 48:31.990
Or should I talk to the head
of Poongsan Police myself?

48:31.990 --> 48:33.550
Hey!

48:36.860 --> 48:39.500
If you're that sure, I'll go.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.790
But if you're wrong,
you'll have to pay for it.

48:42.790 --> 48:46.100
Don't worry.
I'll take full responsibility.

48:48.080 --> 48:49.390
- Choon Byung.
- Yes.

48:49.390 --> 48:52.210
Take the kids and find out
what the Golden Time Team is up to.

48:52.210 --> 48:54.020
- Okay.
- We'll go to Opo.

48:54.020 --> 48:55.540
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.110
<i>This is the Major Crimes Unit.</i>

49:23.100 --> 49:25.600
Detective, isn't that the truck?

49:25.600 --> 49:28.340
<i>Right? Should I go behind him?</i>

49:28.340 --> 49:29.740
<i>No, don't get too close.</i>

49:29.740 --> 49:33.360
We can't let him catch on
before he meets the real culprit.

49:33.360 --> 49:38.150
<i>Yeah, now that we're close,
I'm getting so nervous.</i>

49:38.150 --> 49:43.290
Kang Woo, knowing about the murder
three years ago and the accident today...

49:43.290 --> 49:47.600
<i>He's a complete psycho.
You think the two of us can catch him?</i>

49:47.600 --> 49:50.910
Oh, I'm getting scared.

49:50.910 --> 49:53.750
<i>Yeah...</i>

49:59.060 --> 50:00.710
I got him.

50:00.710 --> 50:04.710
Three minutes ago, he entered Route 9
from Route 45 near Mount Gang Ho.

50:04.710 --> 50:10.350
Director, the suspect's tow truck
left Route 45 three minutes ago.

50:10.350 --> 50:15.890
<i>- We'll send the file, please get him.
- That way.</i>

50:22.750 --> 50:26.080
Detective Park, we need to get him.

50:26.080 --> 50:31.020
Even in that horrific situation,
Captain Jang did his best to leave clues.

50:31.020 --> 50:34.450
Don't worry, I'm going to
wring his neck myself.

50:45.290 --> 50:47.980
It can't be on the news, yet.

50:47.980 --> 50:50.070
I'm so nervous.

50:50.100 --> 50:53.300
Don't be nervous.

50:53.300 --> 50:58.850
You got revenge on the damn lazy cops
who do nothing and take our money.

50:58.850 --> 51:00.540
You've done a great deed.

51:03.500 --> 51:05.930
<i>This is the Major Crimes Unit.</i>

51:05.930 --> 51:08.560
<i>This is Opo-1. We're near
Jang Soo Bok's house.</i>

51:08.560 --> 51:10.510
<i>We'll be there in 10 seconds.</i>

51:10.510 --> 51:15.110
Damn, it was getting fun.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.410
That stupid fool messed things up.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.790
Listen carefully to what I say.

51:24.790 --> 51:26.170
<i>There are cops after you.</i>

51:27.100 --> 51:30.790
What? Where?

51:30.790 --> 51:32.690
Where are they?

51:32.690 --> 51:37.880
<i>Get off on Sokpo Interchange now,
stay on the first lane, and speed up.</i>

51:37.880 --> 51:39.170
What are you saying?

51:39.170 --> 51:41.650
There are tons of cars and CCTVs there...

51:41.650 --> 51:44.430
You said you would
risk your life to screw the world.

51:44.430 --> 51:49.700
Don't worry.
If you do as I say, you'll live.

51:50.550 --> 51:52.690
Hang in there.

51:52.690 --> 51:54.310
Okay.

51:57.940 --> 52:00.740
Agent Park, something's strange.

52:00.740 --> 52:02.110
What is it?

52:02.110 --> 52:06.970
I checked his probation record
and prison record...

52:06.970 --> 52:09.240
It seems like Jang Soo Bok
is computer illiterate.

52:09.240 --> 52:10.580
What do you mean?

52:10.580 --> 52:13.420
You said he posted about
batch processing on an internet site.

52:13.420 --> 52:16.100
That's what I thought,
but according to this

52:16.100 --> 52:17.960
he's definitely computer illiterate.

52:17.960 --> 52:23.120
It must be a total lie that
he created a device to kill cops.

52:23.120 --> 52:26.170
Or maybe someone else posted it.

52:28.600 --> 52:31.800
- What is he doing?
- Get behind him.

52:35.520 --> 52:38.540
That's a coastal road,
why is he going that way?

52:45.400 --> 52:49.690
It smelled so bad, I thought
he hadn't washed for three months.

52:49.690 --> 52:52.790
Oh... oh, shoot...

52:54.700 --> 52:57.100
- Go ahead and search.
- Yes.

52:57.100 --> 52:59.030
Damn.

53:24.170 --> 53:25.370
Chief.

53:26.600 --> 53:29.190
He must be the culprit.

53:32.360 --> 53:33.560
What's this?

53:40.780 --> 53:42.000
<i>[Kang Kwon Joo]</i>

53:43.500 --> 53:45.400
<i>[Koo Kwang Soo]</i>
<i>[Jang Kyung Hak]</i>

53:45.400 --> 53:48.100
<i>[Anyone who degrades me,
I'll kill 1,000 times over.]</i>

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
Choon Byung, get him.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.410
He's got data on Captain Jang and other
Golden Time Team members on his wall.

53:58.410 --> 54:01.830
<i>He just went on the Sokpo Interchange.
We'll get there in five minutes.</i>

54:01.830 --> 54:07.480
Call the highway patrol, don't let the
Seungun guys get to Jang Soo Bok first!

54:08.500 --> 54:09.660
What are you waiting for?

54:09.660 --> 54:12.130
- Go search.
- Yes.

54:12.130 --> 54:14.010
<i>Calling highway patrol...</i>

54:14.010 --> 54:20.830
<i>Murder suspect Jang Soo Bok's tow truck
just entered the Sokpo Interchange.</i>

54:20.830 --> 54:24.690
<i>- Inspect all cars leaving the exits.
- Yes, Sir.</i>

54:31.300 --> 54:33.550
They must have found
something on Jang Soo Bok.

54:33.550 --> 54:36.230
He's dead.

55:09.820 --> 55:12.360
What's with that car since before?

55:15.780 --> 55:17.690
<i>Hang on tight.</i>

55:22.820 --> 55:24.150
Damn.

55:26.860 --> 55:29.220
When did he get here?

56:28.140 --> 56:29.860
Detective Park, hurry!

57:15.250 --> 57:17.290
That's the ocean.

57:19.600 --> 57:23.240
<i>Hyung Joon, I'll get this guy today.</i>

57:23.240 --> 57:24.640
<i>Just wait.</i>

57:32.520 --> 57:36.270
This damn bastard is following me,
and he's not giving up.

57:38.830 --> 57:41.460
Damn you!

57:51.600 --> 57:53.880
It's been a while.

57:53.880 --> 57:56.860
It's that pest from before.

58:00.110 --> 58:04.430
Don't worry.
I'll take care of him for you.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.360
Come.

58:09.480 --> 58:11.370
Let me see.

58:19.690 --> 58:20.990
What's this?

58:20.990 --> 58:23.650
It looks like a device
to cause acceleration.

58:25.150 --> 58:28.370
I'll tell you something funny.

58:29.690 --> 58:32.000
Do you know how
Inuit people catch wolves?

58:34.440 --> 58:37.130
<i>They stick their spear into
the ground on the coldest day.</i>

58:37.130 --> 58:39.770
And they bloody it with the blood
of an animal they just killed.

58:39.770 --> 58:43.370
<i>The exhausted and hungry
wolves will approach it.</i>

58:43.370 --> 58:46.070
Not even realizing their
tongues are getting cut

58:46.070 --> 58:50.150
<i>they'll lick at the blood.</i>

58:50.150 --> 58:51.950
And in the end...

58:53.780 --> 58:55.810
What do you think happens?

58:55.810 --> 58:58.360
I can't get rid of him!

59:01.790 --> 59:04.900
Its tongue gets cut off, and it dies.

59:06.790 --> 59:08.400
Just like you.

59:10.120 --> 59:13.840
<i>Director, according to Agent Jin,
Jang Soo Bok is computer illiterate.</i>

59:13.840 --> 59:17.740
- There must be someone else behind him.
- What?

59:17.740 --> 59:20.250
Someone else?

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.900
Damn, what's wrong with this?

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.510
What's wrong with him?

01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:12.450
He's going to crash!

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:14.800
What did you do to him
that he died after confessing?

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.600
A welfare center director
who never even went near the scene.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.470
Tell me. Say something, you bastard!

01:00:26.830 --> 01:00:29.110
<i>He's installed that device
in that car, too?</i>

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:31.400
Crazy bastard!

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.010
Damn!

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.900
No.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:38.100
No!
