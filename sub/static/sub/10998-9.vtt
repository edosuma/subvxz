WEBVTT

00:01.874 --> 00:03.602
That is a gift from the princess.

00:03.607 --> 00:05.313
- How much can we get for it?
- Not enough.

00:05.449 --> 00:07.350
Tell me about the Kensington Firm.

00:07.351 --> 00:08.804
- What are you doing?
- Pick a side.

00:08.805 --> 00:10.005
Until you do, we're done.

00:10.006 --> 00:11.765
Is the Christopher thing taking over?

00:11.856 --> 00:12.812
A little.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.713
Call my therapist.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.053
Rhys: The Kensington Firm

00:15.054 --> 00:17.049
has now expanded into North America.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.348
But the U.S. is my territory.

00:18.349 --> 00:19.385
Was your territory.

00:19.419 --> 00:22.888
Alice Vaughan's the one who
cost you America... and Benji.

00:22.923 --> 00:24.257
We have to deal with her.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.725
We have to find out what she knows.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.353
So I'll pay a visit to her therapist.

00:27.354 --> 00:29.695
I'll make her a very persuasive offer.

00:29.730 --> 00:30.763
When Alice arrives...

00:30.797 --> 00:31.564
Alice Vaughan?

00:31.598 --> 00:33.699
Jessie Philips. Please come in.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.500
Tell me everything.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.535
We're going to steal a package.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
- What is the package?
- Leah Wells.

00:38.272 --> 00:39.272
Why is she in handcuffs?

00:39.306 --> 00:40.673
She's a counterfeiter.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.696
I can get you out of here.

00:41.697 --> 00:42.908
My terms are non-negotiable.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.277
I want Paul McCartney.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.938
She named her dog Paul McCartney?

00:45.963 --> 00:46.512
She did.

00:46.546 --> 00:48.848
Rhys: The dog and the
package are both gone!

00:48.882 --> 00:50.046
You didn't just steal from me.

00:50.047 --> 00:52.885
You stole from Mummy.
And I'm going to tell.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.120
Rhys: Did you know about this?

00:54.154 --> 00:55.621
No, of course not, Rhys.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.423
I know all about you and Alice Vaughan.

00:57.457 --> 00:59.759
I suggest you stay loyal.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.926
You asked me to choose.

01:02.162 --> 01:03.396
I choose you.

01:05.932 --> 01:07.533
You're working with Dao?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.302
I am.

01:09.336 --> 01:12.738
As a C.I.... a confidential informant

01:12.773 --> 01:13.906
against Rhys Griffiths.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.876
How did this happen?

01:20.180 --> 01:21.547
Rhys knows about you.

01:21.581 --> 01:23.082
About us.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.784
Mm.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.757
He's been surveilling
you, taking pictures.

01:31.792 --> 01:32.958
We'll get you out of here.

01:32.993 --> 01:33.670
No.

01:33.817 --> 01:34.627
Someplace safe.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.661
No. I'm not leaving.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.997
If Rhys is watching me, he'll
know something's up.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.999
Let me take that.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.902
So you're fine with this?

01:42.936 --> 01:43.969
Mm-hmm.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.272
Are you?

01:46.306 --> 01:47.473
Are you fine with this?

01:47.507 --> 01:48.941
The three of us working together?

01:50.444 --> 01:52.912
If Rhys knows about
Alice, it's not safe.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.283
As long as you do what Rhys says,

01:57.317 --> 01:59.285
I'm not in danger, right?

01:59.319 --> 02:00.486
Theoretically.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.290
Then let's do this.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.660
So, what's he offering you?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.527
Reduced sentence... 5 to 10 years.

02:09.562 --> 02:10.930
Depending on what he gives us.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.165
He gets blanket immunity.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.526
He's not getting blanket immunity.

02:13.533 --> 02:14.433
You need to talk to my lawyer.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.392
- There's no time.
- [Cellphone vibrating]

02:15.393 --> 02:16.836
Then there's no deal.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.699

02:19.700 --> 02:20.907
It's Rhys.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.682
I'll call you.

02:23.756 --> 02:25.010
I can't just let you go.

02:25.045 --> 02:25.945
I can't just blow my cover.

02:25.979 --> 02:26.712
Go.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.982
I'm calling my lawyer right now.

What are you doing here?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.660
What are you doing here?

02:41.695 --> 02:43.195
Rhys texted me.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.063
After you stole his counterfeiter.

02:44.097 --> 02:45.664
Apparently he wants to make a deal.

02:45.699 --> 02:46.399
Did he not tell you?

02:46.433 --> 02:48.901
Trouble in paradise already?

02:48.935 --> 02:51.137
What are you two doing here?

02:51.171 --> 02:52.171
- You texted me.
- You invited me.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.205
No, I didn't.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.140
Says so right here.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.742
Sybil: No, he didn't.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.377
I did.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.213
Well, Jamison did.

03:01.248 --> 03:02.248
I can't be bothered.

03:02.282 --> 03:03.582
Sybil.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.216
Mum.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.351
- Hello, Mother.
- Rhysey.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.486
- [Smooching]
- Jamison.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.988
What is this?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.222
What is going on?

03:10.257 --> 03:12.124
We're having a family meal, darling.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.623

03:22.903 --> 03:24.537
All of us together again.

03:24.571 --> 03:27.339
Ben's back in the family at long last.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.708
And all we need now is you.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.244
Is that why you're here, Mum?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.679
To ask me to come back?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.860
Oh, I think you know why I'm here.

03:36.110 --> 03:38.350
You've stolen something from me.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.553
I didn't steal Leah Wells.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.763
I made her a better offer.

03:41.904 --> 03:42.922
But, lovey, you're in no position

03:42.956 --> 03:44.523
to be making offers.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.692
You're starting from scratch.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.093
You've got nothing.

03:48.128 --> 03:49.228
I've got Leah Wells.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.229
Mm.

03:50.263 --> 03:51.130
And if you want her so much,

03:51.164 --> 03:52.932
maybe you should make me an offer.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.533
All right.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.101
Tell Mummy what you want.

03:57.804 --> 04:00.940
- I want what is mine.
- Oh, for God's sake.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.374
I want what was taken from me.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.504
[Sighs] This again?

04:03.505 --> 04:06.078
When Dad died, he
made it perfectly clear

04:06.112 --> 04:07.472
that I was the one to succeed him.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.981
Mum chose me. Get over it.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.416
Yes. And do you know why?

04:10.450 --> 04:11.817
Yes, because he's a man.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.786
No, because he didn't want it.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.154
What does that mean?

04:15.188 --> 04:17.456
Do you know what your problem is?

04:17.491 --> 04:20.434
- Bad parenting.
- You want so much, Margot.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.661
"Mum, may I have your credit card?"

04:22.696 --> 04:23.976
"Mum, may I have your car keys?"

04:23.997 --> 04:26.065
"Mum, may I have North America?"

04:26.099 --> 04:27.566
It's exhausting.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.968
No wonder Ben broke up with you.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.836
Uh, waiter, can we
have some menus, please?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.439
Do you want to know the
secret to a good relationship?

04:33.473 --> 04:34.974
Oh, this'll be good,
coming from the woman

04:35.008 --> 04:35.975
whose husband killed himself.

04:36.009 --> 04:38.077
Your father didn't kill
himself. He was murdered.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.246
I assume you know that because
you murdered him.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.648
The secret to a healthy relationship

04:42.682 --> 04:44.850
is not wanting anything.

04:44.885 --> 04:45.618
Tell her, Ben.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.320
I don't want anything from you!

04:48.355 --> 04:50.356
Of course you do, darling.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.625
That's why you pulled this little
stunt with Leah Wells.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.326
You want Mummy's attention.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.129
You want Mummy to tell
you how clever you are

04:57.163 --> 04:58.230
and how pretty you are.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.099
You mean the way a normal
mother treats her daughter?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.800
It's a bit late for
that, don't you think, Mum?

05:01.835 --> 05:04.003
Yes, I suppose it is.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.747
You will give me what's mine,

05:08.997 --> 05:11.510
or I will take her from you.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.316
You will give me what is mine,

05:17.350 --> 05:19.351
or I will take it from you.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.155
Um, do I get a say in this?

05:23.189 --> 05:24.290
- No.
- Oh, shut up, Rhys.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.228
Margot, wait.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.296
- Ah-ah.
- Margot, wait.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.630
Let her go.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.699
You're with us now, remember?

05:36.036 --> 05:38.337
Good boy.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.873

05:40.907 --> 05:43.044
is anyone else having a starter?

05:45.893 --> 05:48.714
Valerie: I cannot believe I
let you talk me into this.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.849

the divorce is final...

05:50.884 --> 05:52.217
No, Gordon and I are fine.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.020
Um, it's just...

05:55.055 --> 05:56.555

05:58.058 --> 05:59.158
You know what?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.159

06:00.193 --> 06:01.527
Oh, my God.

06:01.561 --> 06:02.328

06:02.362 --> 06:05.164

06:11.137 --> 06:12.605
- You almost done?
- Gordon: Yeah.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.873
I'll take this to the
AUSA in the morning.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.842
Have her call me if
there's any problems.

06:16.876 --> 06:17.943
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.447
It's nice to finally meet.
I've heard a lot about you.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.682
- Oh?
- Good night, Agent Dao.

06:24.865 --> 06:26.552
Good night.

Bonne nuit.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.696

06:38.498 --> 06:42.452
You know, if Christopher... sorry, Ben.

06:44.477 --> 06:48.140
If Ben really can bring
down the Kensington Firm,

06:48.174 --> 06:49.975
he will get immunity.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.310
He will go free.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.979
That is, if the Firm doesn't kill him.

06:54.014 --> 06:56.623
Now, as your friend, I have to ask you,

06:57.682 --> 06:59.385
is that what you really want?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.543
After what he did to you?

07:00.654 --> 07:01.782
To both of you?

07:01.886 --> 07:03.767
'Cause I got to be honest here.

07:03.768 --> 07:05.557

wants to put him away

do the right thing,

won't do this to you again?

Did he tell you?

- How?

I don't know yet. I'll figure it out.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.747
Everything. I told her everything.

Did you tell her about me and Dao?

No, I was about to, and
then I saw the necklace.

No. Of course not.

09:07.268 --> 09:09.903
Margot Bishop targeted
us, stole from us,

09:09.937 --> 09:11.804
and nearly put us out of business.

09:11.839 --> 09:13.540
This bitch is going down.

09:16.110 --> 09:17.210
[Door beeps, opens]

09:22.149 --> 09:23.149
Where have you been?

09:23.183 --> 09:23.883
I'm sorry.

09:23.918 --> 09:25.418
Rhys wants me to find Margot.

09:25.452 --> 09:27.053
He wants to find the counterfeiter.

09:27.087 --> 09:29.155
What do we want? What are we doing?

09:29.189 --> 09:29.989
What's going on?

09:30.024 --> 09:31.124
Sybil is in town.

09:31.158 --> 09:32.793
[Sighs]

09:33.005 --> 09:34.193
All right, since when?

09:34.228 --> 09:35.828
We had a family meeting last night.

09:35.863 --> 09:36.763
Family meeting.

09:36.797 --> 09:38.064
That's funny.

09:38.098 --> 09:41.568
See, I thought we were family.

09:41.602 --> 09:43.636
Reggie, you and I are
brothers no matter what.

09:43.671 --> 09:44.637
Which is why...

09:48.475 --> 09:49.976
I want you to take this

09:50.010 --> 09:52.345
and go back to Cabo,
Morocco, the place in Rome...

09:52.379 --> 09:53.980
just get as far away
from here as you can.

09:54.014 --> 09:55.615
What is going on?

09:57.384 --> 09:58.985
The family is going down.

10:01.288 --> 10:03.156
And I'm trying to keep you out of it.

10:03.190 --> 10:04.591
What about you?

10:04.625 --> 10:05.758
Don't worry about me.

10:05.793 --> 10:07.260
Reggie, please.

10:07.294 --> 10:09.262
[Sighs]

10:10.531 --> 10:12.532
[Exhales sharply]

10:12.566 --> 10:13.921
You are getting rid of the one

10:13.922 --> 10:16.302
person you can trust in all this.

10:16.337 --> 10:17.303
You know that, right?

10:17.338 --> 10:18.304
I do.

10:18.339 --> 10:21.140
But right now, you just
have to trust me and go.

10:27.581 --> 10:30.049
He said, "The Firm is going down."

10:30.084 --> 10:31.417
Mm.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.022
Does he know you're
here, telling me all this?

10:36.056 --> 10:36.956
Reggie: No.

10:36.991 --> 10:38.791
But if Ben is going
after Rhys and Sybil,

10:38.826 --> 10:40.226
then we're all on the same side.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.228
We can do it together.

10:42.262 --> 10:43.129
No.

10:45.065 --> 10:48.034
Let the three of
them take each other out.

10:48.068 --> 10:49.235
We don't need Ben.

10:49.269 --> 10:50.069
[Dog panting]

10:50.104 --> 10:52.238
Hello, Paul McCartney.

10:52.272 --> 10:54.073
Whoa! Hey!

10:54.108 --> 10:56.142
What's going on, little man?

10:56.176 --> 10:57.076
How you doing?

10:57.111 --> 10:58.757
Leah: Hello, we're back!

10:59.847 --> 11:02.415
Leah, this is my associate, Reggie.

11:02.449 --> 11:04.550
Ah. [Chuckles]

11:04.585 --> 11:07.353
The man who hijacked my dog.

11:07.388 --> 11:09.222
The man who rescued your dog.

11:09.256 --> 11:10.156
Ah.

11:10.190 --> 11:12.058
Reggie will be working
with us from now on.

11:12.092 --> 11:14.761
Um, not without your
partner's approval, he won't be.

11:14.795 --> 11:16.162
- Excuse me?
- Your partner?

11:16.196 --> 11:19.399
Margot and I agreed to
a 50/50 partnership.

11:19.433 --> 11:21.167
We agreed to a 50/50 split.

11:21.201 --> 11:23.403
I don't do partnerships
anymore, thanks to Ben.

11:23.437 --> 11:24.404
Okay, so wait.

11:24.438 --> 11:26.105
Uh, relax, handsome. I got this.

11:26.140 --> 11:29.842
Have you ever staged a
counterfeiting con, England?

11:29.877 --> 11:32.178
Because I can print money all day long,

11:32.212 --> 11:34.414
but unless you know where to sell it,

11:34.448 --> 11:36.883
how much to charge, and
how to distribute it,

11:36.917 --> 11:38.584
you're gonna get us all busted.

11:38.619 --> 11:40.286
You need to get over your ex-boyfriend,

11:40.320 --> 11:41.754
start trusting people again.

11:41.789 --> 11:45.224
Make me and Reggie full partners.

11:45.259 --> 11:47.393
Time to start living and loving again.

11:47.428 --> 11:50.296
Am I right?

11:53.300 --> 11:55.101
Ben: You'd like us to find Leah Wells?

11:55.135 --> 11:57.603
Um, not just yet, Benji. I
have another job for you two.

12:00.007 --> 12:02.108
Who are these pretty people?

12:02.142 --> 12:04.544
Morgan Foster and Stephanie Duncan.

12:04.578 --> 12:06.312
She's a lawyer. He runs a non-profit.

12:06.346 --> 12:08.281
They're to be married in a few days.

12:08.315 --> 12:10.283
And we're to kidnap
them, hold them hostage?

12:10.317 --> 12:11.084
You want them dead?

12:11.118 --> 12:12.474
Please say "no" to all of that.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.955
You're to secure
invitations to their wedding.

12:17.257 --> 12:18.891
Is that it?

12:18.926 --> 12:20.560
Well, that's quite a lot.

12:20.594 --> 12:22.795
The wedding will be the
social event of the season.

12:22.830 --> 12:25.832
Lots of security, an impossible get...

12:25.866 --> 12:26.933
for anyone but you.

12:29.303 --> 12:31.270
What about me? I'm as good as him.

12:31.305 --> 12:32.105
Nearly... aren't I?

12:32.139 --> 12:33.806
You'll have to work together on this.

12:33.841 --> 12:35.975
- But what's the con?
- How do you mean?

12:36.009 --> 12:38.611
Well, once we've been
invited to the wedding, then what?

12:38.645 --> 12:40.246
Well, if you're invited to the wedding,

12:40.280 --> 12:41.384
I'll tell you.

12:47.354 --> 12:48.855
Morgan: Is it me?

12:48.889 --> 12:51.357
It's me, isn't it? It's me.

12:51.391 --> 12:54.827
Or maybe... maybe I don't
have the right body for a tuxedo.

12:54.862 --> 12:57.430
I mean, my ass looks all right, but...

12:57.464 --> 13:00.433
- [Murmurs indistinctly]
- Do you have something more...

13:00.467 --> 13:01.434
like that?

13:01.468 --> 13:04.370
Now, that is classic.

13:04.404 --> 13:06.205
This is bespoke.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.273
May I?

13:07.307 --> 13:08.174
Sure.

13:08.976 --> 13:11.277
Wow, wow, wow.

13:11.311 --> 13:12.178
Carlos made it.

13:12.212 --> 13:14.280
Carlos, you can't make this man a tux?

13:14.314 --> 13:15.455
Uh, well, it's too late.

13:15.456 --> 13:16.682
I'm... I'm getting married on Saturday.

13:16.717 --> 13:17.650
Not in that tux, you're not.

13:17.684 --> 13:19.619
Carlos, you can make
him a tuxedo by Saturday.

13:19.653 --> 13:20.486
For me?

13:20.521 --> 13:21.387
Thank you.

13:21.421 --> 13:22.688
It's a done deal.

13:22.723 --> 13:24.390
[Chuckles]

13:24.424 --> 13:26.789
The whole wedding industrial
complex is...

13:26.919 --> 13:28.227
it's out of control. You
know, you hear about it,

13:28.262 --> 13:29.812
you see your friends go through it...

13:29.837 --> 13:30.337
Mm-hmm.

13:30.364 --> 13:32.244
And you swear it's never
gonna happen to you,

13:32.266 --> 13:34.133
and then you find
yourself standing there

13:34.168 --> 13:35.501
in a tux that you hate

13:35.536 --> 13:37.403
when your fiancée calls you to say

13:37.437 --> 13:39.472
that the restaurant you
booked eight months in advance...

13:39.506 --> 13:41.674
eight months... for
your rehearsal dinner

13:41.708 --> 13:43.242
has a rat problem.

13:43.277 --> 13:44.043
Seriously?

13:44.077 --> 13:46.145
I swear. This wedding is cursed.

13:46.180 --> 13:49.215
I mean, every cell of my
being says, "You love this woman.

13:49.249 --> 13:50.249
Don't ruin it by marrying her."

13:50.284 --> 13:52.251
- Are you married?
- Hey, it's me.

13:52.286 --> 13:53.052
Can you do me a favor?

13:53.086 --> 13:54.153
- My friend...
- Morgan.

13:54.188 --> 13:56.656
Morgan has lost the
space for his rehearsal dinner.

13:56.690 --> 14:00.226
Don't tell me it's because
of a sudden rat infestation.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.061
How do these things happen?

14:02.095 --> 14:04.363
[Clicks tongue] And so efficiently, too.

14:04.398 --> 14:05.565
The wedding is Saturday,

14:05.599 --> 14:07.733
so I'm assuming the dinner is Friday?

14:07.768 --> 14:08.901
- Yeah.
- Can you do that?

14:08.936 --> 14:09.969
Great. Thanks.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.905
My friend owns the
Weatherby, so call your fiancée.

14:12.940 --> 14:14.060
We'll arrange for a tasting,

14:14.063 --> 14:15.614
and if you like it, it's yours.

14:15.642 --> 14:18.077
Wow. Uh, who are you?

14:18.111 --> 14:18.978
Charlie Nicholas.

14:20.280 --> 14:22.215
Happy to help.

14:23.221 --> 14:25.251
Danny: So, this is
your real therapist...

14:25.285 --> 14:26.185
Jessica Philips.

14:26.220 --> 14:27.743
And what did she say
when you spoke to her?

14:27.744 --> 14:30.122
She said Margot had a
gun and gave her this.

14:30.157 --> 14:31.357
Alice: She didn't deposit it?

14:31.391 --> 14:32.458
Sophie: She was too scared to.

14:32.492 --> 14:33.459
She still is.

14:33.493 --> 14:35.628
- But no contact information for Margot?
- No.

14:35.662 --> 14:38.464
And no record of a Margot
Bishop entering the country.

14:38.498 --> 14:40.633
And the only alias we
have is Jessie Philips.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.568
Even the QR19
software couldn't find a match.

14:42.603 --> 14:43.603
So we don't know anything.

14:43.604 --> 14:45.404
We don't know where she
is, what she's doing.

14:45.439 --> 14:48.040
We have no way to find her.

14:48.075 --> 14:50.443
We actually do.

14:50.929 --> 14:53.212
I am so glad you called.

14:53.247 --> 14:54.180
Me, too.

14:54.214 --> 14:56.782
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

15:08.154 --> 15:10.289
I think I've been lying to myself.

15:10.323 --> 15:13.125
How so?

15:15.228 --> 15:17.362
This whole time I've been chasing him,

15:17.397 --> 15:19.998
I've told myself it was
because I wanted answers.

15:21.668 --> 15:24.169
I needed to understand
how this happened to me.

15:26.973 --> 15:28.293
And now that I'm getting answers,

15:28.308 --> 15:30.476
now that he's telling me everything...

15:30.510 --> 15:31.276
Everything?

15:31.311 --> 15:33.178
What's he... what's he telling you?

15:35.215 --> 15:38.217
That it wasn't his fault, of course.

15:38.251 --> 15:40.185
That it wasn't him who set me up.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.688
It was his partner.

15:44.591 --> 15:46.158
A partner. Hmm.

15:46.192 --> 15:48.560
He says they were together for 15 years,

15:48.595 --> 15:50.629
that he was loyal to her,

15:50.663 --> 15:53.132
but that he felt like a prisoner,

15:53.166 --> 15:55.634
being with her.

15:55.668 --> 15:59.538
He says that he could hardly
stand to touch her,

15:59.572 --> 16:01.773
that she repulsed him.

16:03.776 --> 16:08.981
He says that he would
have left her a long time ago,

16:09.015 --> 16:13.652
but that this woman
is so fragile, so damaged

16:13.686 --> 16:15.104
that he was scared to leave her.

16:15.105 --> 16:19.525
He was scared that she
might hurt herself, or him.

16:19.559 --> 16:21.527
Or... me.

16:25.231 --> 16:27.065
I'm sorry, may I have a glass of water?

16:27.100 --> 16:28.834
Yes. Absolutely.

16:28.868 --> 16:33.472
Of course, he may be telling
her the same things about me.

16:34.908 --> 16:37.242
But, then, I can't help thinking,

16:37.277 --> 16:42.748
what if this woman
really is a monster...

16:42.782 --> 16:44.716
and he does love me?

16:47.253 --> 16:49.354
[Van door slides]

16:49.389 --> 16:50.756
How'd it go?

16:50.790 --> 16:52.024
Danny: You okay?

16:52.058 --> 16:53.625
I think I'm done with
therapy for a while.

16:53.660 --> 16:55.394
Are we live?

16:55.428 --> 16:57.029
We are live.

16:57.063 --> 16:58.897
- Will you let Agent Dao know?
- Yeah.

16:58.932 --> 17:00.130
Now all we have to do

17:00.131 --> 17:02.749
is wait for Margot to make her move.

17:05.137 --> 17:07.071
Oh, my God. Mmm.

17:07.106 --> 17:07.902
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

17:07.941 --> 17:09.156
Wow.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.608
You guys. This is so...

17:10.643 --> 17:11.643
So, so good.

17:11.678 --> 17:12.511
So good!

17:12.545 --> 17:14.479
I mean, you just want to slow down.

17:14.513 --> 17:16.147
- Just taste every bite.
- Every bite.

17:16.182 --> 17:17.983
What did I tell you? I'm so glad.

17:18.017 --> 17:18.684
Well, we love the food.

17:18.718 --> 17:20.986
- We love the space.
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.020 --> 17:21.887
Honey, why are we sitting here,

17:21.921 --> 17:23.222
pretending that what we think matters?

17:23.256 --> 17:23.989
Mm.

17:24.022 --> 17:25.590
What do you mean?

17:25.625 --> 17:29.595
Well, it's... it's my
mother who should be sitting here.

17:29.629 --> 17:31.730
She's the one that
picked the original restaurant,

17:31.764 --> 17:32.998
that horrible tux.

17:33.032 --> 17:34.299
She tried to pick my dress.

17:34.334 --> 17:35.400
And I get it. They're paying for it.

17:35.435 --> 17:36.927
It's their party, their friends.

17:36.928 --> 17:39.438
Yes, we will know six people
at our own wedding?

17:39.439 --> 17:40.212
I'm not joking.

17:40.213 --> 17:41.607
Oh. That doesn't seem right.

17:41.641 --> 17:43.141
You should be able to
invite whoever you want.

17:43.176 --> 17:44.376
Morgan: But it's not about us.

17:44.410 --> 17:48.247
At this point, it's not even
about the marriage, you know?

17:48.281 --> 17:49.448
How about you guys? Are you married?

17:49.482 --> 17:50.249
- No.
- God, no.

17:50.283 --> 17:52.251
[Scoffs] You see?

17:52.285 --> 17:53.619
Honey, why can't we do that?

17:53.653 --> 17:55.754
You know, make the
commitment to each other

17:55.788 --> 17:57.188
without the circus and the politics?

17:57.190 --> 17:57.956
Yeah, I know.

17:57.991 --> 17:59.625
How long have you been together?

17:59.659 --> 18:00.959
Well, we're...

18:00.994 --> 18:01.827
15 years.

18:01.861 --> 18:02.427
Shut up.

18:02.462 --> 18:03.929
Wow. That's amazing.

18:03.963 --> 18:04.963
- Uh-huh.
- Let me explain.

18:04.998 --> 18:08.676
And I'm not going to
lie... it hasn't been easy.

18:09.624 --> 18:11.467
- How do you do it?
- What's your secret?

18:11.605 --> 18:14.506
- Open relationship.
- Commitment.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.375
Stephanie: Uh, you see?

18:16.409 --> 18:18.277
- Open relationship.
- Open relationship.

18:18.311 --> 18:19.144
Mm-hmm. I knew it.

18:19.178 --> 18:21.013
Why can't straight people have that?

18:21.047 --> 18:21.913
- [All chuckle]
- Well, you know,

18:21.948 --> 18:23.782
we... we have hit a bit of a road block.

18:23.816 --> 18:24.666
We're trying to write our

18:24.691 --> 18:25.617
- vows right now...
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.652 --> 18:28.320
And it just feels disingenuous.

18:28.354 --> 18:29.688
Yeah, because, you know,

18:29.722 --> 18:32.724
- you have to promise forever, and...
- Mm-hmm.

18:32.759 --> 18:33.558
- I can't promise that.
- I can't, either.

18:33.593 --> 18:34.618
- I really can't.
- Stephanie: I know.

18:34.619 --> 18:36.461
No, no. You can't promise that.

18:36.496 --> 18:37.429
What you can promise

18:37.463 --> 18:39.231
is that you will grow
tired of each other.

18:39.265 --> 18:40.866
- Wow. Sweetie.
- [Light chuckles]

18:40.900 --> 18:42.900
You will have an affair with
your personal trainer.

18:42.902 --> 18:44.069
You know, who knows?

18:44.103 --> 18:45.871
We just don't know. We don't, do we?

18:45.905 --> 18:47.239
- We don't know.
- We don't know.

18:47.273 --> 18:49.141
But I think the point
we want to make to them

18:49.175 --> 18:50.676
is that we don't make those promises

18:50.710 --> 18:54.346
because we know we're
going to keep them,

18:54.380 --> 18:58.684
we make those promises to
guarantee we keep them.

19:01.521 --> 19:02.854
- He's right.
- Thank you.

19:02.889 --> 19:04.056
- You're right.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:04.090 --> 19:04.956
- You're right.
- Thank you.

19:04.991 --> 19:07.326
- He's right.
- Marriage is not about love.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.360
No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

19:08.394 --> 19:09.928
Love is about love.

19:09.962 --> 19:11.563
Marriage...

19:11.597 --> 19:13.932
- is [sighs]... is the merging of...
- Yes.

19:13.966 --> 19:15.534
Of... of capital, property.

19:15.568 --> 19:17.336
It's... It's... It's
a business proposition.

19:17.370 --> 19:18.570
- Really?
- Is what it is.

19:20.508 --> 19:22.541
Stephanie:
That's... That's totally right.

19:22.575 --> 19:24.042
He's right.

19:24.077 --> 19:26.044
I don't want that.

19:26.079 --> 19:27.746
No. I don't want that, either.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.181
Oh, my God. I love you.

19:29.215 --> 19:30.048
- I know!
- I love you so much!

19:30.083 --> 19:31.249
I love you, too! I love you so much!

19:31.284 --> 19:32.150
Oh, honey.

19:34.087 --> 19:35.253
So, are we doing this?

19:35.288 --> 19:36.288
I think we are gonna do this.

19:36.322 --> 19:37.055
- Really?
- Yes.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.056
Oh, my God. We're doing this.

19:38.091 --> 19:38.890
We're doing this.

19:38.925 --> 19:39.691
[Both sigh]

19:39.726 --> 19:41.560
We are so happy for both of you.

19:41.594 --> 19:42.461
If there's anything else we can do...

19:42.495 --> 19:43.395
Are you kidding me?

19:43.429 --> 19:45.022
No, I mean, if it weren't for you guys,

19:45.023 --> 19:46.063
we wouldn't be doing this.

19:46.065 --> 19:48.233
No, in fact, I'm gonna
call Mom right now,

19:48.267 --> 19:50.268
and I'm gonna tell
her this wedding is off.

19:50.303 --> 19:52.037
The wedding is off. The wedding is off.

19:52.071 --> 19:53.271
[Claps hands] Yes.

19:53.306 --> 19:55.207
Thank you.

19:58.511 --> 20:00.445
Well...

20:00.480 --> 20:02.247
<i>maybe you'd like to call your mom.</i>

20:05.151 --> 20:06.785
Whoops.

20:06.819 --> 20:09.955
The portrait may not
seem like a security feature,

20:09.989 --> 20:14.059
but people remember faces,
so it has to be just right.

20:14.093 --> 20:18.130
Every strand of hair in place.

20:18.164 --> 20:19.164
That's it.

20:19.198 --> 20:20.499
Margot: Can you get
this animal away from me?

20:20.533 --> 20:21.433
[Dog barks]

20:21.467 --> 20:22.234
Hey. What's wrong?

20:22.268 --> 20:24.503
Did you know Ben's been seeing her?

20:24.537 --> 20:27.439
That he's been seeing
her for this entire time.

20:27.473 --> 20:29.341
Did you?

20:29.375 --> 20:30.108
[Sighs]

20:30.143 --> 20:32.511
Well, I've been seeing her, too.

20:32.545 --> 20:33.612
- What?
- I've been posing as her therapist,

20:33.646 --> 20:35.747
trying to find out what she
knows about all of us,

20:35.782 --> 20:40.485
and until today, she's
been insecure, shy, confused,

20:40.520 --> 20:42.454
but now, apparently,
he's been telling her

20:42.488 --> 20:46.425
how fragile I am, unbalanced, repulsive.

20:46.459 --> 20:47.959
She went on like this for 50 minutes.

20:47.994 --> 20:48.994
[Leah chuckles]

20:49.028 --> 20:50.495
I'm sorry, do you have
something to contribute?

20:50.530 --> 20:52.330
Well, if we were partners, maybe.

20:52.365 --> 20:53.432
Oh, for God's sakes.

20:53.466 --> 20:56.101
She spent 50 minutes telling
you how terrible you are?

20:56.135 --> 20:58.336
Sweetie, you've been made.

20:58.371 --> 20:59.471
No.

20:59.505 --> 21:01.106
No.

21:01.741 --> 21:02.774
No.

21:02.809 --> 21:04.042
[Rustling in purse]

21:04.076 --> 21:05.343
Who is this woman?

21:05.378 --> 21:06.411
[Gasps]

21:08.815 --> 21:10.015
She's a private investigator.

21:13.553 --> 21:14.386
[Van door slides]

21:14.420 --> 21:15.554
Danny: All right.

21:15.588 --> 21:17.722
She stopped. This must be the place.

21:17.757 --> 21:18.911
- We going in?
- Yeah.

21:19.013 --> 21:20.164
Where's Agent Dao?

21:20.276 --> 21:21.960
He's saying we have
to wait for clearance.

21:21.994 --> 21:22.928
- What?!
- No!

21:22.962 --> 21:24.629
And that we can't go
in without a warrant.

21:24.664 --> 21:26.364
No, the FBI can't go
in without a warrant.

21:26.399 --> 21:28.433
We can do whatever we want. Come on.

21:31.287 --> 21:32.571
Where do you think you're going?

21:32.605 --> 21:33.705
Margot's gonna get away.

21:33.739 --> 21:34.473
Yes.

21:34.507 --> 21:36.408
If we go in without a warrant,

21:36.442 --> 21:38.477
the courts will throw out the case,

21:38.511 --> 21:40.445
and she will get away.

21:46.419 --> 21:48.019
[Radio chatter]

21:57.296 --> 21:59.598
Still warm.

21:59.632 --> 22:00.932
We just missed them.

22:00.967 --> 22:02.467
At least we have a warrant.

22:04.570 --> 22:06.671
Search the rest of the building.

[Cellphone rings]

Hello?

22:11.711 --> 22:13.078
Margot: Poor Alice.

22:13.112 --> 22:14.546
Duped again.

22:14.580 --> 22:17.415
I'll be sure to bring that
up in our next session.

22:17.450 --> 22:19.718
[Click]

22:22.882 --> 22:24.324
At least we got here in time

22:24.325 --> 22:25.950
to keep them from
taking their equipment.

22:25.984 --> 22:27.718
Even so, they left with
their hands full.

22:28.652 --> 22:30.610
Judging by the range of serial numbers,

22:30.611 --> 22:32.757
they made over
20,000 hundred-dollar bills.

22:32.791 --> 22:34.091
Wait, that's...

22:34.126 --> 22:35.092
$2 million.

22:35.127 --> 22:35.960
Right.

22:35.994 --> 22:37.061
Fake dollars.

22:37.095 --> 22:37.962
Which they won't use.

22:37.996 --> 22:39.430
Counterfeiters never
use their own money.

22:39.464 --> 22:40.331
You think they'll try to sell it?

22:40.365 --> 22:41.132
Not if they're smart.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.733
Not if the FBI's looking for them.

22:42.768 --> 22:44.068
[Cellphone clicks]

22:44.102 --> 22:46.103
What do you think they'll do with them?

22:46.138 --> 22:47.838
We need to burn it.

22:47.873 --> 22:48.906
- What?
- Absolutely not.

22:48.940 --> 22:50.908
See, this is why I don't have partners.

22:50.942 --> 22:52.309
Reggie and I worked too
hard on this batch

22:52.344 --> 22:53.511
to just set it on fire.

22:53.545 --> 22:55.246
- Wait, what?
- She's been teaching me.

22:55.280 --> 22:57.248
See, Reggie has the right attitude.

22:57.282 --> 22:58.912
Yours needs an adjustment.

22:59.066 --> 23:00.851
[British accent] You're
just a little bit British.

23:00.886 --> 23:02.286
I'm starting to miss Alice Vaughan.

23:02.287 --> 23:04.789
You and I made a
deal for 50% of the take.

23:04.823 --> 23:06.090
No take means no deal.

23:06.124 --> 23:08.426
No deal means you
need to get out of the car.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.693
I beg your pardon?

23:09.728 --> 23:10.995
[Scoffs] If you don't want to sell it,

23:11.029 --> 23:12.163
Reggie and I will, and
he'll take your half.

23:12.197 --> 23:13.030
[Scoffs]

23:13.064 --> 23:14.165
And you'll get caught.

23:14.199 --> 23:16.967
The FBI and Alice Vaughan will be searching
everywhere for this money.

23:17.002 --> 23:18.335
Which means we'll have to move fast,

23:18.370 --> 23:19.470
but at least we'll make a profit.

23:19.504 --> 23:20.471
All in favor?

23:23.375 --> 23:25.142
I vote for profit.

23:25.177 --> 23:27.044
Look at that. Two votes for profit.

23:27.078 --> 23:28.212
How you voting, Parliament?

23:28.246 --> 23:29.680
[Sighing] Oh, God.

23:29.714 --> 23:31.115
What the hell? Let's make some money.

23:36.021 --> 23:37.621
That'll do it. [Chuckles]

23:37.656 --> 23:39.056
Leah Wells is considered

23:39.090 --> 23:41.158
one of the finest
counterfeiters in the business.

23:41.193 --> 23:42.893
Insiders say that the
quality of her work

23:42.928 --> 23:44.061
is better than the U.S. Treasury's,

23:44.095 --> 23:46.797
and her bills are
collector's items on the black market.

23:46.832 --> 23:48.132
But at the moment, she's on the run,

23:48.166 --> 23:49.800
with no safehouse, no equipment...

23:49.835 --> 23:52.236
And $2 million in fake cash.

23:52.270 --> 23:53.237
If she does try to sell it,

23:53.271 --> 23:54.672
it'll be somewhere the
FBI won't think to look.

23:54.706 --> 23:56.173
Does she have any L.A. contacts?

23:56.208 --> 23:57.808
Her first arrest was in L.A., actually.

23:57.843 --> 24:00.311
A counterfeit ring involving
foreign-currency exchanges.

24:00.345 --> 24:01.579
You think she'll go back to her roots?

24:01.613 --> 24:02.680
I don't think she has a choice.

24:02.714 --> 24:05.583
So we monitor every currency
exchange in the city?

24:05.617 --> 24:08.979
Sure, why not? There's
only... 104 of them.

24:09.187 --> 24:11.822
So, if we each take...

24:11.857 --> 24:12.823
26.

24:12.858 --> 24:14.091
Thank you.

24:14.125 --> 24:15.326
Mm-hmm.

24:15.360 --> 24:16.293
We should be able to get it done.

24:16.328 --> 24:17.928
Wherever she goes, the
exchange is gonna want

24:17.963 --> 24:19.083
to move those bills quickly.

24:19.097 --> 24:21.217
So they'll lower their
rates to attract more business.

24:21.233 --> 24:23.167
Can you guys do some
competitive-rate shopping?

24:23.201 --> 24:25.836
See if we can pick up a
couple million collector's items?

24:27.873 --> 24:30.174
Well, we could lie, tell
her the wedding's on,

24:30.208 --> 24:31.275
invitation's in the mail.

24:31.309 --> 24:32.243
She'll never know.

24:32.277 --> 24:33.611
She probably already knows.

24:33.645 --> 24:35.179
Oh, God. She's gonna
chop our bollocks off.

24:35.213 --> 24:36.514
No, she's not.

24:36.548 --> 24:38.249
If she could have pulled this
job off herself, she would have.

24:38.283 --> 24:39.740
- She needs us.
- Why, though?

24:39.862 --> 24:41.385
For what?

25:47.185 --> 25:50.754

whatever you can to protect them.

25:52.357 --> 25:53.891
Mm.

26:07.706 --> 26:09.340
You're a good father.

26:09.374 --> 26:10.623
And I give you my word...

26:10.746 --> 26:13.644
I'll see to it your
sons are well taken care of

26:13.678 --> 26:14.845

26:22.320 --> 26:23.354
Now, darlings.

26:23.388 --> 26:25.389
What did you want to tell me?

26:25.423 --> 26:27.825
Good news, Mum.

26:27.859 --> 26:30.127
We've just been invited to a wedding.

26:30.161 --> 26:32.096

26:34.332 --> 26:36.236
- She shot him?
- She had him shot.

Sybil likes to keep her hands clean.

26:39.106 --> 26:40.840
Who was he?

26:40.874 --> 26:42.008
Well, she called him George.

26:42.042 --> 26:42.742
He had two sons.

26:42.776 --> 26:44.253
She promised not to harm them

26:44.364 --> 26:45.745
so long as he gave her an access number.

26:45.779 --> 26:47.213
But once he gave her the number...

26:47.247 --> 26:48.447
She hurt George instead.

26:48.482 --> 26:51.884
Does the access number have anything
to do with the wedding?

26:51.919 --> 26:53.359

- What?

26:54.588 --> 26:59.158
Rhys got a little too
empathetic with Morgan's Mommy issues.

26:59.192 --> 27:00.092
Does Sybil know?

27:00.127 --> 27:00.993
She'll find out.

27:01.028 --> 27:02.662
And then kill you.

each other, right?

27:09.136 --> 27:10.169
So all you have to do

is still worth it.

27:14.741 --> 27:16.475

invitations to this wedding.

Their parents are furious with them.

27:45.939 --> 27:47.076
Their friends are all calling.

27:47.077 --> 27:48.237
They're gonna want an escape,

27:48.241 --> 27:49.775
and you're going to give them one.

27:49.810 --> 27:51.944
Oh. That's nice of me.

27:51.979 --> 27:54.380

getaway to the Weatherby,

27:54.414 --> 27:55.934
during which time, we'll convince them

27:55.949 --> 27:56.983
that their lives won't be complete

27:57.017 --> 27:58.084
without this wedding.

You're Andy.

28:11.965 --> 28:13.265
Oh.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.301
Well, in that case, I should change,

28:15.335 --> 28:18.571

look like an Andy at all.

28:27.714 --> 28:28.714
Oh, so are we.

28:28.749 --> 28:30.594
Yeah, we didn't tell
anyone where we were going.

28:30.595 --> 28:31.951
- We just left.
- And so you should.

28:31.985 --> 28:34.687
This is so generous of you.

28:34.721 --> 28:36.322
Yeah, we're so grateful to you guys.

Where's Charlie?

28:37.524 --> 28:39.792

28:41.128 --> 28:42.795
Well, the thing is, he's...

You know what? It's not important.

Not important?

You guys came here to get away.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.277
No. Well, you were there for us.

28:58.311 --> 28:59.431
We're gonna be there for you.

Now, tell me everything.
Just... Just give it to me.

29:01.915 --> 29:03.883

29:08.488 --> 29:10.723
Yesterday, just after you left.

29:10.757 --> 29:12.858
We were sitting right here,

29:12.893 --> 29:16.829
and he got down on one
knee, and he proposed.

29:18.331 --> 29:19.899
It was really lovely, actually.

29:19.933 --> 29:22.134
Oh, my God. What did you say?

29:22.169 --> 29:23.402
Well, I said no, of course.

I'm not gonna sit here and
say to you and Morgan

29:26.406 --> 29:27.907
that marriage is an outdated concept

29:27.941 --> 29:30.009
and then turn around and marry him.

29:30.043 --> 29:31.977
Yeah, but you love him, don't you?

29:32.012 --> 29:33.646
Of course I do.

29:33.680 --> 29:35.881
But you love Morgan.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.349
Yes, but...

29:37.384 --> 29:40.086
Y-You've been together for 15 years.

29:40.120 --> 29:41.587
Which you would think

29:41.621 --> 29:44.090
would be proof enough that
I want to be with him,

29:44.124 --> 29:45.524
but no.

29:45.559 --> 29:47.760
He wants... He wants it made public.

29:47.794 --> 29:48.694
He wants it to be legal,

29:48.729 --> 29:51.030
- now that it actually is legal.
- Mm-hmm.

29:51.064 --> 29:53.833
He wants me to stand up in
front of God and everyone,

29:53.867 --> 29:57.937
and... and say, "I
love this man so much.

29:57.971 --> 30:01.741
I am proud to be able to
call him my husband."

30:01.775 --> 30:03.095
Oh, my God. This is all our fault.

30:03.110 --> 30:04.230
- No, it's not.
- It is. It is.

30:04.244 --> 30:05.177
You two were happy.

30:05.212 --> 30:06.212
You were doing fine,
and then we showed up.

30:06.246 --> 30:07.313
We ruined everything.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.949
You showed up and reminded
me of what really matters.

30:09.983 --> 30:11.250
I don't want to spend my life

30:11.284 --> 30:13.018
with someone who can
only commit to himself.

30:13.053 --> 30:14.286
- Andy loves you.

30:16.156 --> 30:18.958

30:18.992 --> 30:22.228
But don't tell me you love me. Show me.

30:22.262 --> 30:25.030
Show me you believe in something
bigger than yourself.

30:25.065 --> 30:27.366

are. They're an act of faith.

give them a minute to talk.
