00:01.302 --> 00:03.171
Previously on
Minority Report...

00:03.204 --> 00:05.306
I'm the reason
they took Dash.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.308
I want my brother
back alive.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.179
Dash.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.515
Detective Vega, Henry Blomfeld,
Deputy Director of the D.I.A.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.250
There's intelligence
that suggests

00:16.284 --> 00:18.186
a terrorist attack is imminent.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.289
Two words keep popping up:
memento mori.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.791
WALLY: There's a D.I.A.
investigation into Blake.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.159
They want to know how
his cops are getting

00:25.193 --> 00:26.794
such great
arrest numbers.

00:26.827 --> 00:29.530
BLAKE: You stopped two attempted
murders in two weeks.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.399
I told you, I have
a confidential...

00:31.432 --> 00:33.434
Confidential informant, meaning
you don't trust me enough

00:33.467 --> 00:35.169
to tell me who's
giving you those tips.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.837
Every time we help her,

00:36.870 --> 00:39.407
we risk putting ourselves
closer to the edge.

00:49.783 --> 00:53.621
DASH (woozily):
Okay... it's time.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.191
Arthur, get dressed.

00:57.225 --> 01:00.128
(mumbles)

01:00.161 --> 01:01.129
Arthur.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.297
Gonna be late.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.601
(mumbles)

01:07.635 --> 01:10.138
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.141
Easy, easy, Dash.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.176
Not again, this damn cocktail.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.544
DASH (woozily):
Okay, it's time.

01:16.577 --> 01:20.214
It's okay. Arthur is right here.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.549
He's right here.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.885
We're gonna be late
for breakfast.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.820
(gasping)

01:26.854 --> 01:29.257
Oh, no, no. Not now, not now.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.826
(gasping, shivering)

01:36.597 --> 01:37.698
Please don't!

01:37.731 --> 01:39.267
(woman screaming, sobbing)

01:55.416 --> 01:57.418
How was
school today?

01:58.419 --> 01:59.820
English.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.791
Fine.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.362
Big plans for the weekend?
WOMAN: He has a game.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.898
I was talking to Guillermo.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.268
(silverware clinks on plate)

02:14.302 --> 02:15.603
May I be excused?

02:15.636 --> 02:17.871
Of course...
No, you may not!

02:21.242 --> 02:23.544
We're gonna sit here
and finish dinner

02:23.577 --> 02:25.579
like a family.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.223
English!
You're not family!

02:35.223 --> 02:36.357
Mijo, go to your room.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.525
Who puts food on
this table, huh?!

02:37.558 --> 02:38.859
Not you!

02:38.892 --> 02:40.561
Honey, please,
he didn't mean it. Hon...

02:40.594 --> 02:41.895
(screams)
Don't touch her!

02:43.297 --> 02:45.499
(low rumbling, plates rattling)

02:50.738 --> 02:51.939
Don't move!

02:51.972 --> 02:53.541
Metro P.D.!

02:53.574 --> 02:55.476
No!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.811
What is this?!
Get off me!

02:57.845 --> 02:59.447
WOMAN:
What's going on?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.581
(trilling)

03:00.614 --> 03:02.283
Positive I.D. on Dante Blake.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.351
(grunting)

03:03.384 --> 03:05.353
WOMAN: No.
Mr. Blake,

03:05.386 --> 03:07.521
by mandate of the District
of Columbia Precrime division,

03:07.555 --> 03:09.390
I'm placing you under arrest
for the future-murder

03:09.423 --> 03:10.524
of your wife Imani Blake.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.626
What?!
(gasps)

03:12.660 --> 03:13.961
I didn't do anything wrong!
Bring it out.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.963
IMANI:
Wait, please! Oh, my God.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.465
Oh, God, is that...? N-No!

03:17.498 --> 03:18.899
Please, don't! No!
Wait! Wait!

03:18.932 --> 03:19.867
No! No!

03:19.900 --> 03:21.669
(grunts)

03:22.836 --> 03:24.305
(gasps)

03:26.307 --> 03:27.975
Mom.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.612
Is everybody okay here?

03:31.645 --> 03:34.548
He was going to kill her?

03:34.582 --> 03:38.386
You think you can take care
of your mom from here, son?

03:41.422 --> 03:42.723
Yes.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.292
Yes, sir.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.861
You'll be notified
regarding details

03:47.895 --> 03:49.363
of your husband's
detention.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.465
(sobs)
You both have
a good night.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.901
Tweak the knee again?

03:53.934 --> 03:56.837
OFFICER: Yeah.
No guts, no glory.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.554
(woozily):
We're gonna be...

04:13.587 --> 04:15.756
late for breakfast.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.758
It's okay.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.493
You still have another hour.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.629
Just go back to sleep.

04:21.662 --> 04:23.497
Okay.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.865
Another hour.

04:35.509 --> 04:40.748
DASH: There are three of us:
Agatha, Arthur and me, Dash.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.950
We were called
the Precognitives.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.387
We can see murders
before they happen.

04:46.420 --> 04:49.022
For six years,
we were held against our will

04:49.056 --> 04:51.024
and used to save lives.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.395
But after the government's
Precrime program was shut down,

04:54.428 --> 04:56.497
we were finally released.

04:56.530 --> 05:00.401
We kept ourselves safe
and hidden from the world,

05:00.434 --> 05:01.935
until now.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.842
Sorry, got held up by
Blake at the precinct.

05:08.876 --> 05:10.378
What'd you get?

05:10.411 --> 05:13.714
So, a guy in this
baseball cap firing a gun,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.082
two people killed.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.751
(gunshot)

05:19.052 --> 05:21.389
And a drawing of an octopus.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.761
(fireworks whistling, popping)

05:29.797 --> 05:31.399
What's this?

05:31.399 --> 05:33.634
It's, uh, fireworks
in the shape of a torch.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.968
Lady Liberty's torch.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.570
This is for Amnesty Day.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.739
What's that?
A holiday.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.042
The day we gave amnesty to ten
million undocumented residents.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.644
They celebrate it
on the Southside.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.113
So when's Amnesty Day?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.649
Tomorrow.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.419
Which means the shooting
happens tomorrow night.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.922
We need to run the shooter.

05:56.624 --> 05:59.593
The logo on the hat
belongs to Cafe Ogun,

05:59.627 --> 06:02.596
a Sino-African restaurant
in the Southside.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.465
Looks like Hawk-Eye flagged it
twice last month

06:04.498 --> 06:05.999
as a potential hot spot.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.001
The system keeps track
of every paying customer,

06:08.035 --> 06:11.071
profiles them for criminal
record, violent history.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.509
It is my day job, you know.

06:15.543 --> 06:19.513
So... ex-cons eat
for free at this place.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.449
Wonder what else
is going on.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.451
AKEELA:
This is interesting.

06:23.484 --> 06:27.455
The cafe's owner, Martin Epe,
was flagged also

06:27.488 --> 06:30.491
for dodging surveillance cameras
around the Southside.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.159
You think Martin
knows our shooter?

06:32.192 --> 06:33.694
Well, he might
work there.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.463
Let's hit Wally's
and scrub your vision

06:35.463 --> 06:37.064
and then have a word
with this guy.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.167
You're welcome.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.469
Thank you, Keela.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.036
Mm.

06:44.972 --> 06:45.973
Hey.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.975
Hi.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.578
Sorry, uh, in a rush.
Got a lead.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.580
Great. I'm coming with you.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.482
What for?

06:54.482 --> 06:56.717
The D.I.A.'s been
looking into you.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.951
I was unaware.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.653
Fine, let 'em.

06:59.687 --> 07:00.988
You guys have been kicking
enough ass out there

07:01.021 --> 07:02.490
to make everybody
here look bad.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.691
Oh, no, that's not
our intention.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.526
(chuckles):
No, it's okay.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.495
It's okay. I told them
I'd take a closer look.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.796
See what you guys
are doing right.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.998
So maybe the rest
of us could learn.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.833
Is this about my C.I.?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.001
What?

07:14.034 --> 07:15.769
(chuckles):
No, of course not.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.572
I just want to see the
dynamic duo in action.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.608
Come on. Buy you lunch.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.146
(sighs)

07:33.587 --> 07:34.722
FEMALE VOICE:
Space cruise, Mile 62.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.757
We are proud to serve all...

07:37.791 --> 07:38.892
(food sizzling)

07:38.926 --> 07:40.193
You know, it's
been a while

07:40.227 --> 07:41.762
since you and I worked
a beat together.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.199
This is around the time
where you say, uh,

07:46.233 --> 07:48.201
"Not long enough,
Lieutenant."

07:48.235 --> 07:50.604
No, I'm happy
you're here.
And so am I.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.072
BLAKE (chuckles):
Okay.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.575
Tell me about this Hawk-Eye
person of interest.

07:54.608 --> 07:55.943
His name is Martin Epe...

07:55.976 --> 07:57.911
I'm sorry, I-I was
asking the analyst.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.781
Oh, me? Sure.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.784
Martin Epe was flagged for
suspicious movement patterns.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.786
Most likely for avoiding
surveillance cameras.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.790
Also his cafe was deemed
a hot spot for ex-cons.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.759
You think they're
running something else

08:11.792 --> 08:14.127
besides, uh, fusion
dinners out here?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.863
Uh, it's possible.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.198
All we do is check up on a lead
the system gives us

08:18.231 --> 08:19.567
and cross it off a list.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.734
Exactly.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.736
Nothing too exciting.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.304
Let's walk the beat.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.039
(doorbells jingle)

08:26.073 --> 08:27.775
Here's your order.
Thank you.

08:27.808 --> 08:28.809
Have a good day.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.747
Hey. How you doing?
Hey.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.753
Hot plate.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.724
Thanks.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.862
There he is.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.299
Good afternoon.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.068
You Martin Epe?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.604
Yes.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.071
Can I help you?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.608
Detective Laura Vega,
Metro P.D.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.012
Okay, that was subtle.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.714
Mr. Epe,

09:06.747 --> 09:09.216
you've been placed
under close watch for 48 hours.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.317
What'd I do?

09:10.350 --> 09:13.186
VEGA: Hawk-Eye detected
suspicious movement patterns.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.255
Were you trying to avoid
surveillance cameras?

09:15.288 --> 09:17.991
Nah, man, I'm trying
to stay out of trouble.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.793
This isn't the
safest neighborhood.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.795
Sometimes I have to
take side streets

09:21.829 --> 09:23.897
to stay clear of gangs.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.198
BLAKE: Yeah, I used
to do that, too.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.934
I grew up
a few blocks from here.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.335
Then you know.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.270
Oh, yeah.
Does that guy
work here?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.272
EPE:
Felix.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.041
He's my delivery boy.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.143
Mind if we speak with him?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.310
Nah, it's not a good time.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.311
You know, he's got
some deliveries.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.346
Amigo!

09:42.983 --> 09:44.685
(grunts)

09:57.130 --> 09:58.666
I... I got to go.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.300
You're not
going anywhere.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.310
Not here.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.258
*

10:33.934 --> 10:35.836
VEGA:
Okay, what makes a delivery boy

10:35.869 --> 10:37.838
so nervous about cops?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.940
Well, it depends on
what he's delivering.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.178
All right, which one
is not like the others?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.749
He's a runner.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.293
Worse than that.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.762
Not just drugs.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.063
Black market.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.936
Martin is using the cafe
as his cover.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.337
And Felix is
his courier.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.140
Question is:
who is he afraid of?

11:18.979 --> 11:20.781
So that guy in there
is our shooter?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.282
Think so.

11:22.315 --> 11:25.252
But we still don't know
who he shoots or why.

11:25.285 --> 11:26.920
Have you talked
to your brother?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.488
He hasn't called
me back yet.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.258
Plus, Blake has been breathing
down our necks all day.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.459
Hmm.

11:32.492 --> 11:35.062
Yeah, this one's personal
for him.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.130
System says Felix is a fourteen.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.432
A fourteen?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.468
Right, you missed
social studies.

11:41.501 --> 11:44.037
40 years ago,
Congress gave amnesty

11:44.071 --> 11:47.074
to all undocumented immigrants
living here in the States,

11:47.107 --> 11:49.009
and as a compromise,

11:49.042 --> 11:51.211
they closed the doors
on everybody else.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.446
The 14th Amendment was repealed.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.015
Which means even if
you're born here,

11:55.048 --> 11:56.483
you're not given
automatic citizenship.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.019
Exactly.
We call those people fourteens.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.155
They don't get
any government benefits,

12:02.189 --> 12:04.191
and they work off the grid.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.926
Not fun.

12:05.959 --> 12:09.296
So why is it
personal for Blake?

12:09.329 --> 12:11.999
Because he was one.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.972
BLAKE:
All right, Felix.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.209
We want to help you.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.877
(scoffs) Help?

12:23.911 --> 12:26.079
You think that's what this does?

12:26.113 --> 12:27.547
People seeing me with cops?

12:27.580 --> 12:30.017
Well, as far as anyone knows,
you were arrested.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.418
Not cooperating.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
Hmm?

12:42.996 --> 12:45.899
Your boss is using his business
to deliver more than takeout,

12:45.933 --> 12:46.834
isn't he?

12:46.867 --> 12:49.269
What were you gonna do
with the gun, Felix?

12:49.302 --> 12:51.171
What gun?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.505
The one that's in
your delivery bag.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.941
I don't know what's in the bags.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.909
I never look
inside them, ever.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.178
That's the rule.
You're lying.

12:58.211 --> 12:59.880
Vega, he doesn't know
what he's carrying.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.381
I'm telling you,
he's gonna use that gun.

13:01.414 --> 13:03.150
How do you know?

13:05.518 --> 13:07.387
(sighs)

13:11.925 --> 13:13.360
Then give us a name.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.296
The man at the restaurant,
the one with the tattoo.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.364
I don't know who you mean.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.167
So you're telling me
you don't recognize this symbol?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.317
Where did you get this?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.619
He saw you talking to us, Felix.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.222
That's why you
tried to run.
No.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.490
I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.992
I don't know about any of this.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.962
No.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.432
Who is he?

13:52.465 --> 13:54.134
You're boss? An enemy?

13:55.135 --> 13:56.636
Give us a name.
BLAKE: Vega.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.604
We're done here.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.374
You can go.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.943
What?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.447
Can I have my deliveries back?

14:07.480 --> 14:09.482
Seriously?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.664
You're making a mistake.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.233
He's lying.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.500
He's gonna commit a crime.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.102
We can hold him on possession.

14:29.136 --> 14:31.004
I know we could, but
he didn't know, Lara.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.405
What makes you so sure?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.474
What makes you so sure that
he's gonna commit a crime?

14:34.507 --> 14:37.677
If I didn't know you any better,
I'd say you were profiling.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.047
Me? Profiling?
Yes.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.614
What do you think
Hawk-Eye does?

14:41.648 --> 14:43.350
There's billions of dollars
worth of technology

14:43.383 --> 14:44.517
doing the profiling as we speak.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.153
That is the tool we were given.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.189
That tool has helped you get
the best arrest record at Metro.

14:49.222 --> 14:50.657
And you know why I do better

14:50.690 --> 14:52.425
at using Hawk-Eye
than any other cop?

14:53.726 --> 14:55.662
Because I trust my instincts.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.530
Is that right?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.968
Did your instincts
give you this?

15:00.968 --> 15:02.435
Or your informant?

15:02.469 --> 15:03.703
So you want to do
this dance again?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.572
No, I don't want
to do this dance again.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.008
I want you to do
what you have to do.

15:09.376 --> 15:12.012
And make sure you're right.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.085
What happened?
Where's he going?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.120
He's letting us do our job.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.438
Got a minute?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.440
Yeah, come on in.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.610
So I just sent you
an encrypted archive

15:43.643 --> 15:45.412
of everything
I could dig up on you

15:45.445 --> 15:47.114
that the D.I.A. could find,

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
like you asked.
Anything good?

15:49.149 --> 15:51.284
You? No. Unfortunately,
you're really boring.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.752
(chuckles)

15:52.785 --> 15:55.122
But I wanted to give you
a heads-up,

15:55.155 --> 15:57.357
because I think
they'll probably be asking

15:57.390 --> 15:59.492
about your father's
Precrime conviction.

15:59.526 --> 16:01.028
Stepfather.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.232
My real father died
when I was four.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.267
Sorry.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.508
Yeah, the next couple years
after that were, uh...

16:17.510 --> 16:19.446
They were rough.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.615
I'll bet.

16:22.649 --> 16:26.553
Then my mother met Dante.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.756
And he was, uh...

16:29.789 --> 16:32.059
successful.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.465
So my mother married him...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.633
to give me a better life.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.604
Well, you'd never know,
having met her now,

16:44.637 --> 16:46.739
what she must have been through.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.575
She's always very happy.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.210
Of course she is.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.180
She has a good son,
takes care of her,

16:53.213 --> 16:56.183
pays for her unlimited trips
to the salon.

16:56.216 --> 16:57.084
(chuckles)

16:57.084 --> 16:58.318
I seriously have no idea
how many times

16:58.351 --> 16:59.386
she's gonna color her hair.

16:59.419 --> 17:00.753
(laughs)

17:00.787 --> 17:03.390
Well, I doubt the D.I.A.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.392
is gonna hold Dante's sins
against you,

17:05.425 --> 17:07.394
but I wanted to give you
a heads-up.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.096
I really appreciate it.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.565
Hey, Akeela?

17:12.599 --> 17:14.434
Yeah?

17:14.467 --> 17:16.803
What happened to Dante
after Precrime ended?

17:19.572 --> 17:23.476
He, uh, he died at Open Vistas.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.425
Memento Mori.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.860
That's the name of the group
we believe is planning

17:40.893 --> 17:42.795
a terrorist attack
on the District.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.764
Now, they may already be
embedded in the area,

17:44.797 --> 17:46.566
which is why we're alerting
all law enforcement

17:46.599 --> 17:48.201
around our nation's capital.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.837
What do you even know
of the group's operations?

17:50.870 --> 17:52.839
This.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.841
Coded message cards

17:54.874 --> 17:57.577
delivered to scientists
around the country.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.779
Each one stamped
with this blurred shape.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.449
The anamorphic image
of a human skull.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.852
What medieval Christians
called memento mori.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.155
A reminder of our own mortality.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.756
Is that a threat?

18:09.789 --> 18:12.425
Could be an invitation.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.893
After receiving these messages,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.229
16 prominent researchers
disappeared.

18:16.263 --> 18:20.200
Geneticists, chemists,
computational biologists.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.901
No bodies were found.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.736
So they were kidnapped?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.372
Or recruited.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.806
For what?

18:26.839 --> 18:29.209
Terror cells of scientists?

18:29.242 --> 18:30.377
Yeah.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.179
What are they planning?

18:32.212 --> 18:34.714
That's a good question,
Lieutenant.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.550
Which is what we're gonna need
all of your help to find out.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.596
(sighs)

18:49.629 --> 18:50.797
Took you two long enough.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.532
Didn't think
you'd want to stop this one.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.834
I called you;
you never called me back.

18:54.867 --> 18:57.804
Oh, right.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.473
(sighs)

19:00.507 --> 19:01.908
So, did you see anything?

19:01.941 --> 19:03.343
Did you get a name?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.212
Remember when
this was a quid pro quo?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.414
Yeah, then you got me kidnapped
and my finger chopped off.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.649
There's barely a scar.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.418
I'd still say you owe me one.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.254
Felix Alvarez.

19:14.287 --> 19:15.588
He's the shooter, we know.

19:15.622 --> 19:16.889
Who were the victims?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.225
The only other name I got

19:18.258 --> 19:19.226
was Guinta.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.793
Tendo Guinta.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.629
(beep)

19:22.662 --> 19:24.531
Akeela, I need you
to run a name.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.800
Tendo Guinta-- known gang leader

19:27.834 --> 19:30.337
for Los Pulpos, the Octopus.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.904
Does he have a tattoo
of an octopus

19:31.938 --> 19:33.540
on his forearm?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.375
Uh, yep.
Where is he now?

19:35.408 --> 19:36.476
We need a location.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.977
Uh, last eye-dent

19:38.010 --> 19:40.647
puts him at Cafe Ogun.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.848
Thanks, Akeela.

19:41.881 --> 19:44.284
He went back to the restaurant.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.518
Why?

19:45.552 --> 19:46.919
Following Felix?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.622
Maybe it's a drug deal
that goes bad.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.990
If Tendo finds Felix,

19:51.023 --> 19:52.625
maybe the shooting happens
at the cafe.

19:54.594 --> 19:56.263
It's fun watching you kids work.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.733
Forgot this.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.951
I take it this is yours?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.456
Yeah.

20:27.860 --> 20:30.530
Now, who the hell are you?

20:37.404 --> 20:38.671
I'll start. You're an informant.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.308
You've helped Detective Vega
on several cases.

20:41.341 --> 20:43.042
That means you've helped me.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.812
Lieutenant Blake,
Metro P.D.

20:45.845 --> 20:47.780
Arthur.

20:47.814 --> 20:51.318
Not sure what you mean,
but, okay, I'll take that.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.320
And you're welcome.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.422
And don't try to
bob and weave.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.557
I do this for a living.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.058
Harass innocent men
while they try to eat lunch?

20:59.091 --> 21:00.293
Question criminals.

21:00.327 --> 21:01.461
You think I'm a criminal?

21:01.494 --> 21:02.762
Well, I'm guessing

21:02.795 --> 21:05.332
you call yourself
a businessman.

21:05.332 --> 21:07.600
Connected, though.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.035
To who?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.803
The Tongs?

21:10.837 --> 21:12.539
The Kenyans?

21:12.572 --> 21:14.641
Independent contractor.

21:14.674 --> 21:15.842
Ah, no loyalty, then?

21:15.875 --> 21:17.677
I have one.
Yourself?

21:19.045 --> 21:21.714
Hmm. A criminal who only
cares about himself

21:21.748 --> 21:22.949
doesn't help cops.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.951
You have a conscience.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.720
In my circles, that's an insult.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.856
Look, I know Vega promised
not to out you.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.057
I'll honor that.

21:31.090 --> 21:33.025
Vega's a good cop.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.362
But she's also
a cowboy.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.565
And sooner or later,
she'll put us both at risk.

21:38.598 --> 21:41.434
From now on,
you should be coming to me.

21:47.674 --> 21:49.709
Help you?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.829
My assistant.
She's very...

22:09.862 --> 22:11.398
proprietary.

22:11.431 --> 22:12.432
Hmm.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.570
I'd say that was
a nice lunch, but...

22:17.604 --> 22:18.771
Right.

22:18.805 --> 22:21.408
Well, if you get
another tip...

22:21.408 --> 22:22.875
you know where
to find me.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.878
I'll be in touch.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.823
Look into that.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.426
All options are
on the table.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.966
(doorbells jingle)

22:51.170 --> 22:53.873
Well, looks like
the lunch rush is over.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.842
No Felix, no Tendo.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.977
(door creaks)

22:58.010 --> 22:59.712
We are closed.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.948
Well, your sign
says you're open.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.553
You followed us?

23:06.586 --> 23:07.887
You want to tell me why you ran

23:07.920 --> 23:09.922
an eye-dent search
on Tendo Guinta?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.625
Hawk-Eye showed...
You can go ahead
and stop lying to me now.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.793
I met Arthur.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.161
How did you...

23:15.194 --> 23:16.663
You...
Though I assume

23:16.696 --> 23:17.997
that was his alias.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.901
You're probably right.

23:23.235 --> 23:24.737
Why are you looking for Tendo?

23:24.771 --> 23:25.738
You know him?

23:25.772 --> 23:26.939
Of him.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.475
El Pulpo.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.477
That's his sign, the octopus.

23:30.477 --> 23:32.579
He united eight ethnic gangs
in a truce.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.146
Now he runs the Southside.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.749
We think it was
a drug deal gone sideways.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.785
Maybe Felix
stole product

23:38.818 --> 23:40.487
that he was supposed
to deliver to Tendo.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.591
She's not a waitress.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.826
What?

23:46.859 --> 23:47.927
They're robbing the place.

23:49.629 --> 23:50.497
There are three of them,

23:50.530 --> 23:52.499
counting the woman.
Only one is armed.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.073
Ready? Go.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.812
YOUNG MAN:
It's gonna be okay.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.914
(man groaning)

24:07.947 --> 24:09.616
YOUNG MAN:
They went off that way.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.622
Stop!
Move!

24:16.288 --> 24:18.157
Metro P.D.!

24:18.190 --> 24:19.526
Blake!

24:24.864 --> 24:26.633
Now it's safe.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.554
You knew how many there were.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.790
You knew one of them was armed.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.263
You're one of them.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.874
*

25:22.221 --> 25:24.857
How long have you known?

25:24.891 --> 25:26.759
VEGA:
Does it matter?

25:26.793 --> 25:28.160
Did you recruit him?

25:28.194 --> 25:30.129
No. He came to me.

25:30.162 --> 25:31.664
See, the next step
would have been...

25:31.698 --> 25:33.332
Me coming to you
and then you saying no,

25:33.365 --> 25:35.167
and then a dozen people
dying violently today.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.603
No.
Blake...

25:36.636 --> 25:37.604
You lied to me!

25:37.604 --> 25:39.806
I was stopping murders.
I was saving lives.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.609
Don't you get it?
You can lose your job over this!

25:42.609 --> 25:44.010
I think a judge
would be sympathetic.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.778
I think a judge would
throw out every case

25:45.812 --> 25:48.715
you worked on with Dash,
because he's a Precog.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.182
But they won't find out.

25:50.216 --> 25:52.351
Not if you don't say anything.
How long

25:52.384 --> 25:54.621
did you really think you were
gonna keep this a secret?

25:54.654 --> 25:55.955
You mean without your help?

25:55.988 --> 25:57.189
Or with it?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.325
So you want
to bring me down, too?

25:59.358 --> 26:02.194
Huh?

26:02.228 --> 26:03.796
I have a career, Vega.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.832
And having Dash
can only help that.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.634
He's led to more closed cases

26:07.667 --> 26:08.968
than this department
has seen since...

26:09.001 --> 26:10.302
Since Precrime?

26:10.336 --> 26:11.704
It was banned.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.373
It's illegal and unethical.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.842
Not if we're careful.

26:15.875 --> 26:17.877
Oh, Vega...

26:25.084 --> 26:28.054
I can't cover this up.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.089
I have to tell them the truth.

26:34.226 --> 26:35.995
And then what?

26:36.028 --> 26:37.830
What? Then the brass thinks
that you planned the whole thing

26:37.864 --> 26:39.231
to pad your stats?

26:39.265 --> 26:40.833
Upwardly mobile lieutenant,
always hungry

26:40.867 --> 26:42.935
for the next promotion.
Why not use a Precog?

26:42.969 --> 26:44.737
Not if I'm the one
who turns him in.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.739
Then they'll think
that you're incompetent.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.074
You vetted Dash yourself.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.076
A Precog was hired
under your watch.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.981
Are you threatening me, Vega?

26:55.014 --> 26:57.416
No.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.219
I'll tell them
that you had no idea.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.754
I have your back.

27:01.788 --> 27:04.190
But it won't matter.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.292
You'll have to resign.

27:22.108 --> 27:23.743
You heard.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.380
I heard.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.317
I'm sorry I got you involved
in all of this.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.320
I'm not.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.729
The cameras
just went down,

27:42.729 --> 27:44.130
along with
the lights.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.398
Imagine that.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.467
Akeela, why are
you doing this?

27:48.500 --> 27:50.737
You could lose
your job.

27:53.039 --> 27:56.008
You spent your entire life
saving other people.

27:56.042 --> 27:59.746
It's about time
someone did you a favor.

28:03.950 --> 28:05.117
Good luck.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.153
Akeela...

28:10.522 --> 28:12.759
Thank you.

28:16.863 --> 28:18.865
*

28:47.326 --> 28:49.328
Okay.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.032
But we can still
get out in front of it.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.466
In front? How?

28:54.500 --> 28:55.868
What... what are you thinking?

28:55.902 --> 28:57.369
Blomfeld.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.538
He thinks we never
should have ended Precrime.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.808
That means
he can help us.
Help?

29:03.009 --> 29:04.176
By using this...

29:04.210 --> 29:06.278
Him.
...the right way,

29:06.312 --> 29:07.980
while covering our asses.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.315
No, Blake.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.251
Dash is a human being,
not just a-a tool.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.187
He's a weapon, and we should
hand him to the good guys

29:15.221 --> 29:16.989
before anyone else
gets ahold of him.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.025
Do you even have any idea
who the good guys are?

29:19.058 --> 29:21.360
You want to trust
the D.I.A.?

29:21.393 --> 29:24.363
Precrime failed because
the government misused it.

29:24.396 --> 29:27.366
They watched when my dad died,
and they did nothing.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.101
So don't talk to me about
who the good guys are,

29:29.135 --> 29:30.036
because you don't know.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.839
I know a lot more
than you think, Lara.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.947
Where are you going?

29:49.055 --> 29:50.222
How'd it go?

29:50.256 --> 29:51.423
Badly.

29:51.457 --> 29:52.859
Well...
What?

29:52.859 --> 29:54.026
...it's about
to get worse.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.928
What did you do?

30:06.105 --> 30:08.340
I don't know
what you want to do with me,

30:08.374 --> 30:09.608
but it can wait.

30:09.641 --> 30:14.013
Those fireworks I saw--
they happen tonight.

30:14.046 --> 30:18.284
That is how long we have
to stop a double homicide.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.019
And we could use your help.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.858
Come on, Lieutenant.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.960
Before you turn me in,

30:27.994 --> 30:30.229
don't you want
to run with a Precog?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.864
Just once?

30:43.642 --> 30:46.178
BLAKE: And this is how you've
been stopping all those murders?

30:46.212 --> 30:47.646
By taking art classes?

30:47.679 --> 30:50.016
More or less.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.353
Who's Arthur?
Is he your brother?

30:54.386 --> 30:56.422
Let's keep Arthur
out of this for now.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.457
I want the truth on everything.

30:58.490 --> 30:59.992
Sure.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.994
But is it worth
someone being murdered?

31:02.028 --> 31:04.430
DASH: Because there are
no time-outs, doing what we do.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.298
The clock keeps ticking.

31:09.201 --> 31:10.369
All right.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.603
Later.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.177
Tell me everything.

31:18.210 --> 31:19.311
Here's what we know.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.013
Felix works for Martin Epe.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.381
He's a black market runner.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.683
And tonight,
he's gonna have a showdown

31:24.716 --> 31:26.585
with Tendo's men,
killing two of them.

31:26.618 --> 31:29.155
What we don't know is
the where and the why.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.689
Not much to go on.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.524
There never is.

31:35.962 --> 31:38.497
Well, I would start
by going to El Pulpo's corner

31:38.530 --> 31:40.632
on 7th and 9th.

31:44.536 --> 31:47.239
Look.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.707
See how the tentacles cross?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.709
It forms two digits.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.011
Seven, nine.

31:52.044 --> 31:54.113
Yeah. 7th Street and 9th Avenue.

31:54.146 --> 31:55.581
If I was looking
for Tendo,

31:55.614 --> 31:56.983
that's where I'd be going.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.320
You forgot how good I am, huh?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.222
No. Just how cocky.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.724
You could've told us
you knew Pulpo earlier.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.360
But then how would I have
found your C.I.?

32:10.762 --> 32:12.564
We've got to call
in backup.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.033
And tell them what?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.267
A Precog told you?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.205
Welcome to our snow globe.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.547
(whistling, popping)

32:31.117 --> 32:33.119
(dogs barking in distance)

32:43.429 --> 32:45.431
*

33:06.085 --> 33:08.154
I didn't do anything.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.122
VEGA:
Not yet.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.224
We know you came here
to shoot El Pulpo.

33:12.258 --> 33:13.359
What? No.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.527
I don't want to shoot anyone.

33:15.561 --> 33:18.064
El Pulpo stole
something from me.

33:18.064 --> 33:19.231
And I need it back.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.100
DASH:
What did they steal?

33:21.133 --> 33:22.301
One of your deliveries?

33:22.334 --> 33:23.302
Yeah.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.803
(sighs)

33:24.836 --> 33:27.506
My boss was behind
on his protection payments,

33:27.539 --> 33:30.342
so Pulpo found other ways
to get his protection money.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.144
Like steal our deliveries.

33:32.178 --> 33:34.080
Today they robbed
the restaurant.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.182
What did they take from you?

33:36.215 --> 33:37.749
Drugs?

33:37.783 --> 33:39.218
I don't know.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.719
I told you I never
open the packages,

33:40.752 --> 33:43.522
but this one was important.

33:43.555 --> 33:44.756
Important how?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.692
My boss said
the sender paid a fortune

33:46.725 --> 33:48.427
to have this package delivered.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.396
If I don't get it back,
I'm a dead man.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.566
I know what
you're thinking, okay?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.568
It was stupid to take this job.

33:56.602 --> 33:59.671
But... you don't understand.

34:17.323 --> 34:19.558
DANTE: Who puts food
on this table, huh?!

34:19.591 --> 34:21.660
Not you!
MOTHER: Honey, please!
He didn't mean it.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.295
DANTE: After everything
I've given to him,

34:23.329 --> 34:24.563
you, this family?!

34:24.596 --> 34:26.465
(low rumbling)

34:26.498 --> 34:28.367
Don't move!
Metro P.D.!

34:29.501 --> 34:31.737
No!

34:31.770 --> 34:34.773
BLAKE: I thought I wanted to
kill my stepfather that night.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.676
But I guess I wouldn't have
gone through with it,

34:37.709 --> 34:40.346
or they would've arrested me.

34:40.379 --> 34:44.716
But if he would've hurt
my mother one more time,

34:44.750 --> 34:47.386
I would've done
something stupid.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.457
Something I couldn't take back.

34:51.490 --> 34:54.293
I guess someone was
watching over me.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.297
I remember.

35:07.173 --> 35:09.875
Give us the gun, Felix.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.478
You can't break into
this gang's apartment

35:12.511 --> 35:14.346
and expect to get out alive.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.481
You got that right.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.894
(quiet chatter in Spanish)

35:44.343 --> 35:46.345
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

36:01.293 --> 36:02.828
Looks like business is good.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.830
Pays the bills.

36:04.863 --> 36:07.966
You looking to make
a purchase, Detective?

36:07.999 --> 36:10.802
(chuckles)
Not exactly.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.872
You guys have a package
that belongs to my friend here.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.442
Felix.

36:16.475 --> 36:19.645
Right now, it looks like
your man Felix belongs to us.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.867
(laughter)

36:45.337 --> 36:47.439
That's big!

36:47.473 --> 36:49.575
Coming from someone
that's outnumbered,

36:49.608 --> 36:52.311
outgunned, that's big.

36:54.313 --> 36:55.714
Let me talk.

36:55.747 --> 36:58.384
See what I can do for you.

36:58.417 --> 37:00.419
(laughs)

37:08.760 --> 37:11.297
(whispers):
Vega.

37:17.436 --> 37:18.904
Just be ready.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.844
(Felix grunting,
man speaking Spanish)

37:25.877 --> 37:28.480
Please, don't.
Please, no. Don't!

37:28.514 --> 37:30.349
Hey!

37:30.382 --> 37:32.318
Where are you going?

37:32.351 --> 37:33.051
Hey!

37:33.084 --> 37:35.454
Don't move!

37:40.759 --> 37:42.328
(screaming)

37:44.062 --> 37:45.531
(clamoring)

37:47.733 --> 37:48.700
Blake!

38:03.114 --> 38:04.850
Get down!

38:10.622 --> 38:11.590
Behind you!

38:17.863 --> 38:19.064
(panting)

38:28.807 --> 38:30.576
BLAKE: Come out
with your hands up!

38:30.609 --> 38:32.077
Come out with
your hands up!
Yeah.

38:32.110 --> 38:34.613
Now!

38:39.885 --> 38:42.053
(sirens wailing)

38:42.087 --> 38:43.922
(officers chattering)

38:43.955 --> 38:46.692
Hey, Felix, I can't let
you take that package.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.394
Please.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.562
I have to.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.802
I plan to take down your boss,
Martin Epe.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.404
I could really use your help.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.540
Me? No, I can't.

39:13.051 --> 39:16.555
You didn't think you were gonna
get off that easy, did you?

39:16.588 --> 39:19.558
You owe me community service
for the next year.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.928
And don't think that
I won't check up on you.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.000
Damn right.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.679
So what happens now?

39:44.215 --> 39:47.052
And I ask you, Lieutenant,
to consider

39:47.085 --> 39:50.456
you just helped take down
an illegal hijacking operation.

39:50.489 --> 39:53.925
And kept a young man
from ruining his life.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.030
I didn't.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.699
Hawk-Eye did.

40:17.048 --> 40:20.652
Why is Lieutenant Blake
at my favorite lunch spot?

40:20.686 --> 40:23.455
What the hell
happened to you?

40:23.489 --> 40:25.591
He knows.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.192
Knows what?

40:27.225 --> 40:29.094
But we can trust him.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.762
Vega trusts him.

40:30.796 --> 40:32.564
And was I wrong about her?

40:32.598 --> 40:34.733
He knows who you are?

40:37.636 --> 40:39.638
I think he knows
who you are, too.

40:43.609 --> 40:45.110
(groans)

40:50.716 --> 40:51.917
Yeah, I was waiting for that.

40:54.252 --> 40:56.588
This changes everything.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.962
(door closes)

41:15.173 --> 41:17.843
A book?

41:17.876 --> 41:20.011
Not just any book.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.880
It's a first edition.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.916
Hmm. Let's run a scan,
see what we can find out.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.156
A collector reported it missing
18 months ago.

41:31.189 --> 41:34.025
It must have made it's way
to D.C. in the black market.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.794
Well, so much for
sexy headline.

41:35.827 --> 41:38.764
"Metro Cop Busts
Huge Drug Ring."

41:38.797 --> 41:40.932
I'll get it logged
and put into evidence.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.104
All that for a book.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.051
E-Excuse me?

42:00.085 --> 42:02.854
Where do I go to claim
a stolen piece of property?

42:02.888 --> 42:03.855
Third floor.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.891
Thank you.

42:13.799 --> 42:15.801
*

42:33.852 --> 42:35.854
*

43:01.379 --> 43:03.649
(beeping)
