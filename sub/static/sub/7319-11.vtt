00:12.400 --> 00:14.200
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.233 --> 00:15.433
(Meredith) YOU AND BURKE,
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:15.467 --> 00:17.333
WE'RE EXISTING
IN TOTAL SILENCE.

00:17.367 --> 00:19.433
THAT HAND IS WORTH $2 MILLION.
I WANT IT FIXED.

00:19.467 --> 00:21.400
MARK AND I--IT WASN'T
A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

00:21.433 --> 00:25.300
I WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.
AT LEAST, I THOUGHT I WAS.
YOUR SISTER MOLLY'S

00:25.333 --> 00:28.800
JUST BEEN ADMITTED
FOR AN EMERGENCY C-SECTION.
MOLLY'S NOT MY SISTER.

00:28.833 --> 00:31.600
(Addison) SHE IS.
YOU HAVE THE SAME FATHER.

00:31.633 --> 00:35.033
WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY
AND FIGHT FOR US?
I DID. I-I TRIED.

00:35.067 --> 00:35.800
WHY DIDN'T YOU TRY HARDER?

00:35.833 --> 00:38.300
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
OFF MY SERVICE.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.767
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I THINK YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.167
(Cristina)
HAROLD O'MALLEY, 63,

00:42.200 --> 00:44.067
DIAGNOSED WITH ESOPHAGEAL CANCER
AND SEVERE AORTIC REGURGE.

00:44.100 --> 00:48.167
YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE
AND LEAVE MY BOY IN CHARGE?
YOU ARE NOT GONNA DIE.

00:50.733 --> 00:53.600

00:53.633 --> 00:57.167

00:57.200 --> 01:00.200

01:01.533 --> 01:02.467
(snorts)

01:02.500 --> 01:04.500
MORNING.

01:04.533 --> 01:07.133
***

01:07.167 --> 01:08.433
ARE YOU WATCHING ME SLEEP?

01:08.467 --> 01:09.600
MAYBE.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.767
ARE YOU
SOME KIND OF WEIRDO

01:11.800 --> 01:13.267
WHO WATCHES WOMEN SLEEP?

01:13.300 --> 01:16.233
MAYBE.

01:16.267 --> 01:17.733
(laughs)

01:17.767 --> 01:22.133
***

01:22.167 --> 01:24.500
IZZIE.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.533
WHAT?

01:27.567 --> 01:31.400
I JUST DROPPED $8.7 MILLION
ON THE FLOOR.

01:31.433 --> 01:33.067
AND?

01:33.100 --> 01:34.833
***

01:34.867 --> 01:40.167
I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DROP
$8.7 MILLION ON THE FLOOR.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.767
***

01:41.800 --> 01:43.600
YOU NEED TO DEPOSIT
THAT CHECK.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.467
GEORGE...

01:45.500 --> 01:47.333
YOUR FATHER'S SURGERY
IS TOMORROW.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.533
ANY CHANCE YOU'RE MISPLACING
YOUR ANXIETY

01:49.567 --> 01:51.367
ON ME AND MY CHECK?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.767
NO, THERE IS NO CHANCE.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.133
THAT CHECK RUINS MY MORNING
EVERY MORNING.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.500
IT BELONGS IN THE BANK.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.100
WOULD YOU JUST PLEASE--
AS A FAVOR TO ME--

01:59.133 --> 02:02.833
WOULD YOU JUST...
PUT IT IN THE BANK?

02:02.867 --> 02:04.233
PLEASE.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.800
MM. NO.

02:05.833 --> 02:10.067
BUT... IF YOU'RE NICE TO ME
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN MINUTES,

02:10.067 --> 02:12.533
I WILL
GIVE YOU A RIDE TO WORK.

02:12.567 --> 02:16.733
***

02:21.100 --> 02:23.133
YOU DON'T DESERVE
$8.7 MILLION!

02:23.167 --> 02:26.767
MM. SO TRUE.
SO TRUE.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.667
***

02:30.700 --> 02:33.167
(Izzie) HOW'S BURKE DOING?
I DON'T KNOW.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.533
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.367
HE JUST HAD SURGERY
YESTERDAY,

02:36.400 --> 02:38.300
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW HE'S DOING?
THEY'RE NOT SPEAKING.

02:38.333 --> 02:40.233
I THOUGHT THEY MADE UP.
THEY DID, SORT OF.

02:40.267 --> 02:43.133
BUT SHE'S STILL
NOT SPEAKING TO HIM?
HE'S NOT SPEAKING TO ME.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.067
THEY'RE NOT SPEAKING
TO EACH OTHER.
OKAY.

02:45.100 --> 02:46.833
DID YOU ASK DEREK
ABOUT BURKE'S HAND?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.767
I DON'T WANT TO GET
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.133
DEREK AND I ARE HAPPY.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.333
COULD WE JUST KEEP IT
THAT WAY FOR A WHILE?

02:52.367 --> 02:54.267
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ALWAYS
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE

02:54.300 --> 02:56.633
AND JUST ASK HIM YOURSELF.
HER GUT'S NOT BIG ENOUGH
FOR THAT.

02:56.667 --> 02:57.833
OH, ALEX,
YOU HURT ME.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.767
(laughter)
OH, GEORGIE.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.800
(people shouting indistinctly)

03:02.833 --> 03:04.567
(Harold) QUIET DOWN!

03:04.600 --> 03:08.467
EVERYONE, QUIET DOWN!

03:08.500 --> 03:10.833
MORNING, EVERYBODY.
GOOD MORNING.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.133
UH, WHO'S PRESENTING?

03:12.167 --> 03:15.400
OH, CAN GEORGIE DO IT?
HE'S REAL GOOD.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.267
COME ON, GEORGIE. YEAH!

03:17.300 --> 03:19.667
COME ON.
COME ON.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.367
UM... HAROLD O'MALLEY, 63,

03:22.400 --> 03:24.433
STATUS--
POST-AORTIC VALVE REPLACEMENT.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.267
MORNING CHEST X-RAY SHOWED
NO ATELECTASIS

03:27.300 --> 03:29.200
AFTER AGGRESSIVE C.P.T.
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS.

03:29.233 --> 03:31.533
UM, SCHEDULED FOR
A TRANSHIATAL ESOPHAGECTOMY

03:31.567 --> 03:33.500
TOMORROW MORNING AT 9:00.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.500
THAT'S IT.

03:36.533 --> 03:40.300
(cheering)

03:43.267 --> 03:46.433
UM, FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES,
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST

03:46.467 --> 03:49.700
IF THE EXTENDED FAMILY COULD
WAIT OUT IN THE WAITING AREA.
(groaning)

03:49.733 --> 03:51.567
(Harold)
JUST A FEW MINUTES, GUYS,

03:51.600 --> 03:54.267
AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK.
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:54.300 --> 03:56.200
(Miranda) HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
MR. O'MALLEY?

03:56.233 --> 03:58.233
(Louise) HE'S FEELING GREAT.

03:58.267 --> 03:59.800
"BETTER THAN EVER,"
HE SAID.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.333
WHICH IS WHY WE HAD EVERYBODY
COME OUT TODAY,

04:02.367 --> 04:03.733
BECAUSE WE FIGURED
AFTER TODAY,

04:03.767 --> 04:06.233
HE MAYBE WON'T BE FEELING
SO GREAT FOR A WHILE.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.567
UH, AFTER THE SURGERY,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.367
UH, THEN WHEN DO WE START
CHEMO AND STUFF?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.567
THAT PROTOCOL DEPENDS ON
WHAT WE FIND

04:12.600 --> 04:14.300
WHEN WE OPEN YOU UP, HAROLD.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.300
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT YOU FIND?
UH, GREY.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.333
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH

04:18.367 --> 04:20.267
THEY CAN TELL
FROM LABS AND SCANS,

04:20.300 --> 04:22.767
SO THEY REALLY NEED TO GET
A GOOD LOOK INSIDE

04:22.800 --> 04:25.700
TO SEE IF THE CANCER
HAS SPREAD.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.067
IF IT'S SPREAD, THAT CHANGES
HOW MUCH CHEMO HE NEEDS?

04:28.100 --> 04:30.367
THAT CHANGES A LOT
OF THINGS.
LIKE WHAT?

04:32.733 --> 04:35.433
I'LL LET THE ONCOLOGIST
EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU

04:35.467 --> 04:37.333
LATER TODAY, HAROLD.

04:37.367 --> 04:39.767
AND DR. GREY WILL BE
TAKING YOU THROUGH

04:39.800 --> 04:42.200
A FINAL BATTERY OF
PREOPERATIVE TESTS BEFORE WE GO.

04:42.233 --> 04:43.167
SO, UM--

04:43.200 --> 04:45.767
SO IT WOULD BE BEST
IF THE PARTY WENT HOME.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.067
MM.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.833
(clears throat)
DR. SHEPHERD.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.633
UH, DR. BURKE'S HAND--
HAS HE HAD ANY TREMORS?

04:55.667 --> 04:56.833
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL.

04:56.867 --> 04:59.367
UH, BUT I'M--I'M
ONE OF HIS DOCTORS.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.567
YOU'RE ALSO HIS GIRLFRIEND.
ASK HIM YOURSELF.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.800
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
WHO'S PRESENTING? MORNING.

05:03.833 --> 05:06.167
PRESTON BURKE, POST-OP DAY ONE
FROM I AND D

05:06.200 --> 05:08.600
OF A COMPRESSIVE HEMATOMA
TO THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS.

05:08.633 --> 05:10.367
HE IS AFEBRILE, AND VITAL SIGNS
WERE STABLE OVERNIGHT.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.167
INCISIONS ARE CLEAN
WITH NO SIGNS OF INFECTION.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.633
LAST MORPHINE WAS GIVEN
AT 2:00 THIS MORNING.

05:15.667 --> 05:16.900
ASK ABOUT THE HAND.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.067
YOU ASK.
NO, IT'S JUST ONE QUESTION.
(whispers) BE A FRIEND.

05:20.067 --> 05:21.633
DR. YANG...

05:21.667 --> 05:24.500
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO SHARE
WITH THE REST OF US?

05:26.700 --> 05:29.600
NO, MA'AM. SORRY.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.633
(Derek) LOOK GOOD, PRESTON.

05:31.667 --> 05:34.067
TAKE IT EASY ON THE NURSES.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.233
I'LL DO MY BEST.
O'MALLEY.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.700
YOUR FATHER'S SURGERY
IS TODAY?

05:38.733 --> 05:40.067
TOMORROW.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.767
(woman) YOU OKAY, HONEY?

05:52.800 --> 05:54.367
YEAH.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.067
CAN YOU JUST HELP ME...

05:56.100 --> 05:57.200
MM-HMM.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.233
SCOLIOSIS?

06:00.267 --> 06:02.067
LOOKS LIKE
A BIRTH DEFECT.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.567
LOOKS LIKE HELL.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.100
(grunts)

06:05.133 --> 06:06.833
(sighs)

06:06.867 --> 06:08.667
WHAT ARE YOU ALL STARING AT?

06:08.700 --> 06:10.367
REALLY, IF YOU'RE EXPECTING ME

06:10.400 --> 06:12.700
TO BE THE BRAVE AND HEARTWARMING
DIFFERENTLY-ABLED GIRL,

06:12.733 --> 06:16.600
THAT ISN'T GONNA HAPPEN,
SO GO AHEAD AND DO YOUR THING.

06:17.767 --> 06:19.067
YEAH.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.500
(Miranda) OKAY. STEVENS.

06:23.067 --> 06:24.833
HEATHER DOUGLAS, 17,

06:24.867 --> 06:26.700
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
OF VATER SYNDROME.

06:26.733 --> 06:28.567
(Miranda) WHICH IS?

06:28.600 --> 06:31.067
(Izzie) VATER SYNDROME
IS A GENETIC CONDITION

06:31.067 --> 06:32.800
THAT AFFECTS THE VERTEBRAE,
ANUS, TRACHEA,

06:32.833 --> 06:34.767
ESOPHAGUS
AND RENAL SYSTEM.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.833
WOW. GIVE THIS GIRL A MEDAL.
SHE MEMORIZED THE WHOLE ACRONYM.

06:37.867 --> 06:39.433
WHICH I ASSURE YOU
IS A HELL OF A LOT EASIER

06:39.467 --> 06:41.233
THAN LIVING WITH IT.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.633
(Miranda) STEVENS.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.833
RIGHT. UM, HEATHER IS--

06:44.867 --> 06:48.500
IS IN TODAY FOR A LITHOTRIPSY
TO REMOVE KIDNEY STONES

06:48.533 --> 06:50.167
AND A THORACOPLASTY

06:50.200 --> 06:53.300
TO ALLEVIATE PRESSURE
ON HER LUNGS.
CAN I ASK--

06:53.333 --> 06:56.067
I-I KNOW I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO
BE HERE TO REMOVE A FEW RIBS,

06:56.067 --> 06:59.067
BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE EVER
TRIED ANYTHING MORE RADICAL

06:59.100 --> 07:01.333
TO TREAT THE SPINAL CURVATURE?
LET'S SEE.

07:01.367 --> 07:02.400
IF BY "MORE RADICAL,"

07:02.433 --> 07:05.233
YOU MEAN HAVING A STEEL ROD
INSERTED INTO MY SPINE,

07:05.267 --> 07:06.633
THEN, YEAH, WE'VE TRIED.

07:06.667 --> 07:09.800
THE ROD JUST BENT.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.733
REMOVING THE KIDNEY STONES
MAY SEEM MINOR,

07:11.767 --> 07:14.067
BUT IT WILL REALLY IMPROVE
YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.067
REALLY? SO THIS SURGERY
IS GONNA GET ME LAID?

07:17.100 --> 07:19.767
(woman) HEATHER, STOP IT.
MOM, I'M SORRY,

07:19.800 --> 07:22.667
BUT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT
IMPROVING MY QUALITY OF LIFE,

07:22.700 --> 07:25.333
AND I DON'T THINK DOCTORS
SHOULD MAKE PROMISES

07:25.367 --> 07:28.067
THEY CAN'T KEEP.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.167
(Meredith)
LAURA GREY-THOMPSON,

07:31.200 --> 07:34.567
BORN FOUR DAYS AGO
WITH JEJUNAL ATRESIA.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.300
CORRECTED SURGICALLY.
(door opens)

07:36.333 --> 07:38.367
UH, POST-OP COURSE--

07:38.400 --> 07:40.367
OH, I'M--I'M SORRY.
AM I INTERRUPTING?

07:40.400 --> 07:43.233
HER MOM AND GRANDMA
HA-HAVE THE FLU,

07:43.267 --> 07:45.167
AND THEY ASKED ME
TO GET AN UPDATE.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.400
(Addison) OH, SHE'S DOING
VERY WELL, MR. GREY.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.433
WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE
IN JUST A MINUTE.

07:49.467 --> 07:52.233
(Miranda) DR. GREY,
YOU WERE SAYING?

07:52.267 --> 07:53.567
UM...

07:53.600 --> 07:55.267
EXCUSE ME, UH...

07:55.300 --> 07:58.233
I'LL JUST COME BACK
A LITTLE LATER.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.700
GREY?

08:06.733 --> 08:08.500
UM...

08:08.533 --> 08:10.600
UH, LAURA GREY-THOMPSON, UM,

08:10.633 --> 08:13.633
HAD SOME DILATION OF THE BOWELS
ON X-RAY THIS MORNING.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.233
WE NEED TO DO A BARIUM ENEMA

08:16.267 --> 08:17.533
TO MAKE SURE THERE'S
NO INTESTINAL STRICTURE.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.700
DR. GREY, I'D LIKE YOU TO STICK
WITH MR. O'MALLEY THIS WEEK.

08:31.733 --> 08:34.167
YANG, PIT. KAREV, SLOAN.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.333
STEVENS, PREP HEATHER DOUGLAS
FOR SURGERY.

08:36.367 --> 08:37.533
O'MALLEY.
YES.

08:37.567 --> 08:40.600
YOU'RE TAKING THE REST
OF THIS WEEK OFF?
YES, MA'AM.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.533
MAY AS WELL TAKE TODAY, TOO,

08:42.567 --> 08:44.467
SPEND SOME TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY.
THANK YOU.

08:44.500 --> 08:47.433
UH, DR. BAILEY, AS THINGS
PROGRESS WITH MY DAD, UH...

08:47.467 --> 08:49.233
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES WE--
WITH FAMILIES--

08:49.267 --> 08:51.167
WE CODDLE THEM,
SUGARCOAT THINGS.

08:51.200 --> 08:53.567
IT WOULD HELP ME
IF YOU WERE STRAIGHT WITH ME

08:53.600 --> 08:55.500
AS THINGS PROGRESS.
(pager beeps)

08:55.533 --> 08:56.467
OKAY.

08:56.500 --> 08:57.667
THANK YOU.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.600
UH, DR. BAILEY.
D-DR. BAILEY.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.533
I KNOW THAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO PREP HER ONLY,

09:01.567 --> 09:04.200
BUT ANY CHANCE I CAN
SCRUB IN ON HEATHER DOUGLAS?

09:04.233 --> 09:07.100
I MEAN, A VATER PATIENT ISN'T
SOMETHING YOU SEE VERY OFTEN.

09:07.133 --> 09:08.167
NO.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.833
BUT I'M READY.
I AM READY.

09:09.867 --> 09:12.100
YOUR PSYCHIATRIST HAS NOT
GIVEN YOU AN ALL CLEAR.

09:12.133 --> 09:14.700
HE'S... I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING
HE HAS ASKED ME TO DO,

09:14.733 --> 09:16.367
EVERYTHING,

09:16.400 --> 09:19.200
EXCEPT DEPOSIT
MY INHERITANCE CHECK, WHICH--

09:19.233 --> 09:22.600
WAIT, YOU HAVE NOT DEPOSITED
A NEARLY $9-MILLION CHECK YET?

09:22.633 --> 09:25.300
IT--IT'S...
HE IS BEING UNREASONABLE.

09:25.333 --> 09:27.233
THAT CHECK HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ANY--

09:27.267 --> 09:29.167
WHAT'S UNREASONABLE
IS THAT YOU'RE LOSING

09:29.200 --> 09:30.600
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A DAY
IN INTEREST.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.100
THAT'S UNREASONABLE.

09:32.133 --> 09:34.167
YOU CLEARLY
ARE NOT REASONABLE YET,

09:34.200 --> 09:35.533
WHICH, I THINK,

09:35.567 --> 09:38.833
IS THE POINT YOUR PSYCHIATRIST
IS TRYING TO MAKE.

09:38.867 --> 09:42.500
HEY, I NEED A C.B.C.
AND A CHEM-7 ON HAROLD O'MALLEY.

09:42.533 --> 09:44.067
I NEED THESE LABS ASAP.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.467
EVERYBODY NEEDS EVERYTHING
"ASAP."

09:45.500 --> 09:47.067
OH, YES.

09:47.067 --> 09:48.367
AND ALL THROUGHOUT
THIS HOSPITAL,

09:48.400 --> 09:51.567
PEOPLE ARE DYING WHILE YOU
GIVE ME CRAP ABOUT "ASAP."

09:54.200 --> 09:55.533
HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:55.567 --> 09:57.567
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
YOUR FATHER?
FREEZING UP ON ROUNDS--

09:59.533 --> 10:01.200
OH, GOD.
THAT WAS MORTIFYING.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.200
THANK YOU. THANKS.

10:03.233 --> 10:05.500
OH, OKAY.
IT WASN'T MORTIFYING?

10:05.533 --> 10:08.533
I JUST WISH THE BABY
WOULD GET WELL AND GO HOME

10:08.567 --> 10:10.467
AND THATCHER
WOULD GO WITH HER.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
IS THAT WRONG?
(clicks tongue)

10:12.533 --> 10:14.433
OH, WRONG WOULD BE, UH,

10:14.467 --> 10:17.100
IF YOU WISHED
THE BABY WOULDN'T GET WELL.

10:17.133 --> 10:18.500
OKAY, GOOD. THANKS.

10:18.533 --> 10:20.433
YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT
TO THANK ME,

10:20.467 --> 10:23.467
UM, YOU COULD ASK DEREK
IF BURKE HAS HAD ANY TREMORS.

10:23.500 --> 10:24.800
TALK TO HIM.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.067
NO.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.833
'CAUSE THEN HE WINS.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.033
WINS WHAT?

10:32.433 --> 10:34.200
FORGET IT.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.833
DO YOU HAVE A FATHER?

10:38.867 --> 10:42.100
I HAVE A STEPFATHER.

10:42.133 --> 10:45.433
HE'S NICE.
I SEE HIM FOR YOM KIPPUR.

10:48.467 --> 10:51.333
KAREV, WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT HOW I LIKE MY CHARTS?

10:51.367 --> 10:53.267
I LIKE TO ROUND ON PRE-OP
BEFORE POST-OP.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.467
DO YOU LIKE WASTING MY TIME?
IS IT FUN FOR YOU?

10:56.500 --> 10:58.400
NO, SIR.
THEN GET IT RIGHT.

10:58.433 --> 11:01.600
DO YOU LIKE ABUSING THE INTERNS?
IS IT FUN FOR YOU?

11:01.633 --> 11:04.167
YES, IT IS,
AND IN CASE YOU'VE FORGOTTEN,

11:04.200 --> 11:06.300
YOU DON'T GET THE HIGH HORSE
THIS WEEK, ADDISON.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.733
NOT THIS WEEK.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.267
HE'S AN ASS.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.267
NOT THIS WEEK.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.100
(Callie) YOU KNOW SHEPHERD
PRETTY WELL, YEAH?

11:18.133 --> 11:20.067
LOTS OF HAIR,
TOO MANY WOMEN,

11:20.067 --> 11:21.800
LIKES ELEVATORS
AND LONG WALKS ON THE BEACH.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.700
SO, UM, WHAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO GET HIM TO DO SOMETHING?

11:24.733 --> 11:27.600
WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING?
A CONSULT THAT
THE PATIENT HASN'T REQUESTED

11:27.633 --> 11:29.533
BUT THAT THE FRIENDLY
NEIGHBORHOOD ORTHO RESIDENT

11:29.567 --> 11:31.467
THINKS IS WORTH PURSUING.
SHEPHERD THINKS HE'S BUSIER

11:31.500 --> 11:33.400
AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE
IMPORTANT THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

11:33.433 --> 11:35.200
STANDARD NEUROSURGEON
BREED.
EXACTLY.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.267
OKAY, SO?

11:37.300 --> 11:39.367
SO HE'LL SAY NO
UNTIL YOU STARE HIM DOWN.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.567
"STARE HIM DOWN"?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.700
STARE HIM DOWN.

11:43.733 --> 11:45.700
(laughs)

11:52.233 --> 11:53.767
(chuckles)

11:56.300 --> 11:58.833
YOU'RE WAY TOO HOT
TO BE A DOCTOR.

11:58.867 --> 12:00.500
OKAY.

12:02.167 --> 12:04.067
I MEAN, AREN'T PEOPLE
WHO LOOK LIKE YOU

12:04.100 --> 12:06.667
SUPPOSED TO BE DUMB?

12:08.100 --> 12:11.367
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA BE IN MY SURGERY, ARE YOU?

12:11.400 --> 12:13.833
'CAUSE I'M A LITTLE
TOO YOUNG TO DIE.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.567
I WILL NOT BE IN
ON YOUR SURGERY.

12:16.600 --> 12:19.267
SEE? I KNEW IT.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A DOCTOR.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.633
I AM A DOCTOR.

12:20.667 --> 12:24.667
IT'S JUST THAT WHEN MY,
UH, FIANCé DROPPED DEAD

12:24.700 --> 12:27.367
NOT TOO LONG AGO,
I WENT A LITTLE NUTS,

12:27.400 --> 12:30.800
AND, UH, NO SURGERIES
FOR ME FOR A WHILE.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.433
WELL, SO MUCH FOR MY THEORY

12:34.467 --> 12:37.333
THAT LIFE DOESN'T SUCK
FOR PRETTY PEOPLE.

12:37.367 --> 12:39.367
(sighs)

12:39.400 --> 12:41.700
I'M SORRY
I WAS SUCH A BITCH TO YOU.

12:41.733 --> 12:44.133
WELL... YOU'RE IN PAIN.

12:44.167 --> 12:47.067
SOMETIMES I'M A BITCH
FOR NO GOOD REASON AT ALL.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.333
(laughs)

12:50.367 --> 12:52.267
(Callie) OH, UM...
DR. SHEPHERD.
YES.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.767
I AM SO SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.400
I KNOW YOU'RE VERY, VERY BUSY,
BUT THERE'S A GIRL HERE.

12:56.433 --> 12:58.600
SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD WITH SEVERE
SCOLIOSIS FROM VATER SYNDROME.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.567
SHE'S HERE FOR THORACOPLASTY
BECAUSE HER RIBS ARE PRESSING

13:00.600 --> 13:02.500
AGAINST HER LUNGS, AND SHE'S
ALREADY HAD TWO SPINAL FUSIONS

13:02.533 --> 13:04.200
AND A SEGMENTAL
SPINAL INSTRUMENTATION

13:04.233 --> 13:05.233
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

13:05.267 --> 13:08.067
SHE'S BENT OVER AT 90 DEGREES,
WHICH CLEARLY SUCKS.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.500
"CLEARLY SUCKS," IS THAT
YOUR PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT?

13:10.533 --> 13:14.267
MY PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT
IS THAT WE CAN HELP HER.

13:14.300 --> 13:16.700
MY DAY IS IMPOSSIBLE.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.800
I'LL COME BY FOR A CONSULT
IN THE MORNING.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.300
I'M A GOOD STARER.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.300
DOCTORS,
COULD I GET A WORD?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.700
OH, HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
HAROLD?

13:41.733 --> 13:43.533
FEELIN' GREAT.
FEELIN' FINE.

13:43.567 --> 13:46.067
IT'S JUST THAT
THE ONCOLOGIST...

13:46.067 --> 13:47.400
HE SAID THAT, UH,

13:47.433 --> 13:50.800
IF THE CANCER
IS IN OTHER ORGANS,

13:50.833 --> 13:54.367
HE SAID THAT MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T
PROCEED WITH THE SURGERY.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.267
THAT'S RIGHT, HAROLD.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.200
IF THE CANCER'S SPREAD
TO YOUR OTHER ORGANS,

13:58.233 --> 14:01.100
IT WOULD COMPROMISE YOUR ABILITY
TO RECOVER FROM THE SURGERY.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.367
SO IF YOU CLOSE ME UP
AND THEN SEND ME HOME,

14:04.400 --> 14:06.800
I GET, WHAT,
A COUPLE OF WEEKS TO LIVE?

14:06.833 --> 14:09.400
YOU'D HAVE...
WEEKS OR MONTHS, YES.

14:09.433 --> 14:12.733
NO. NO, YOU GOTTA TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT,

14:12.767 --> 14:14.667
'CAUSE I CAN SURVIVE THIS.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.467
I KNOW I CAN.

14:16.500 --> 14:17.700
O'MALLEYS, WE'RE FIGHTERS.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.833
MR. O'MALLEY,

14:19.867 --> 14:22.467
IT--IT'S JUST NOT
A GOOD IDEA TO--

14:22.500 --> 14:23.800
YOU KNOW, MY WIFE...

14:23.833 --> 14:25.733
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
40 YEARS.

14:25.767 --> 14:29.767
I MAKE HER CRAZY,
BUT... 40 YEARS.

14:29.800 --> 14:33.467
SHE NEEDS ME.
MY FAMILY NEEDS ME.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.800
I CAN'T LET YOU CLOSE ME UP
AND THEN TELL THEM

14:35.833 --> 14:37.667
THAT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT CAN BE DONE

14:37.700 --> 14:40.267
WHEN I KNOW I CAN FIGHT IT.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.433
SO I... I'M ASKING
FOR YOUR WORD.

14:42.467 --> 14:45.767
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.333
MR. O'MALLEY,

14:47.367 --> 14:51.167
MY JOB IS TO DO THE BEST I CAN
FOR YOU MEDICALLY.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.533
AFTER--

14:52.567 --> 14:55.433
WELL, CLOSING ME UP
AND SENDING ME HOME TO DIE

14:55.467 --> 14:57.133
ISN'T BEST FOR ME,

14:57.167 --> 15:01.067
NOT MEDICALLY
OR ANY OTHER WAY.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.133
PLEASE...

15:04.167 --> 15:06.233
TAKE THE TUMOR OUT.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.067
ALL RIGHT.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.267
ALL RIGHT?

15:23.067 --> 15:24.133
THANKS.

15:31.100 --> 15:33.567
THIS FALLS UNDER
CONFIDENTIALITY?

15:33.600 --> 15:37.267
IF YOU'RE ASKING IF YOU CAN
TELL HIS SON, THE ANSWER'S NO.

15:50.300 --> 15:53.367
(snoring)

15:53.400 --> 15:56.800
(snorts)

15:56.833 --> 15:58.367
YOU'RE WATCHING ME
SLEEP AGAIN?

15:58.400 --> 16:01.267
YOU'RE CUTE WHEN YOU SLEEP.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.633
YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU SLEEP?

16:02.667 --> 16:04.567
WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS UP
BEFORE THE ALARM?

16:04.600 --> 16:07.067
(yawns) I'M A LIGHT SLEEPER.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.367
SO SOMETHING WOKE YOU UP.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.367
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.700
IT'S JUST THAT...

16:15.733 --> 16:17.200
YOU SNORE A LITTLE.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.067
WHAT? I DO NOT.

16:19.067 --> 16:21.267
YES, YOU DO.
I-I LOVE IT.

16:21.300 --> 16:23.200
I FIND IT CHARMING
THAT SUCH A BIG NOISE

16:23.233 --> 16:25.100
CAN COME FROM
SUCH A LITTLE PERSON.

16:25.133 --> 16:27.600
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT'S NOT CHARMING?
WHAT?

16:27.633 --> 16:29.233
YOUR MORNING BREATH.

16:29.267 --> 16:30.733
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

16:30.767 --> 16:32.433
I'M JUST SAYING,

16:32.467 --> 16:34.367
SEEING HOW YOU'RE ALWAYS UP
BEFORE ME,

16:34.400 --> 16:36.300
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER
BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.500
I DON'T--

16:37.533 --> 16:39.433
OKAY, THIS IS ME
BRUSHING MY TEETH.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.167
THANK YOU.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.333
(laughs)

16:44.367 --> 16:46.733
SURGERY'S TODAY?

16:46.767 --> 16:49.167
YEAH. I'M OKAY.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.100
YEAH. I-I HAVE
A REALLY GOOD FEELING.

16:51.133 --> 16:52.600
YEAH?
YEAH.

16:52.633 --> 16:55.233
I DIDN'T EVEN BAKE ANYTHING
FOR YOU.

16:55.267 --> 16:57.567
THANK YOU.

17:03.267 --> 17:05.067
(thunder rumbles)

17:05.100 --> 17:06.067
(coughs)

17:06.067 --> 17:07.200
AHA. BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.700
AT LEAST SOMETHING'S DRY
AROUND HERE.

17:08.733 --> 17:11.367
DOES IT EVER STOP RAINING
IN THIS HELLHOLE?
NOT REALLY.

17:11.400 --> 17:13.567
GREAT. GOOD TO KNOW.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.667
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS, KAREV,
VANILLA?

17:15.700 --> 17:17.433
ARE YOU TRYING TO POISON ME

17:17.467 --> 17:20.367
OR ARE YOU JUST TRYING TO MAKE
MY DAY A LITTLE BIT WORSE?
MARK.

17:20.400 --> 17:22.400
COFFEE CART MUST HAVE
SCREWED UP.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
CAN'T HANDLE COFFEE,

17:22.433 --> 17:23.767
YOU CAN'T HANDLE PLASTICS.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.267
MAYBE YOU OUGHTA HEAD BACK
TO THE GYNIE SQUAD

17:26.300 --> 17:29.467
WHERE LIFE WAS ALL SQUISHY
AND PINK.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.733
SQUISHY AND PINK
THOUGH IT MAY BE,

17:32.767 --> 17:36.533
I HAVE AN AMAZING SURGERY
TODAY, KAREV, IF YOU WANT IN.

17:36.567 --> 17:39.233
YEAH.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.367
(thunder rumbling)

17:41.400 --> 17:43.300
(Olivia) GOOD MORNING,
DR. BURKE.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.733
YES, IT IS.

17:45.767 --> 17:48.333
BEAUTIFUL MORNING.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.667
I LOVE WATCHING THE RAIN.

17:50.700 --> 17:54.067
FEELING GOOD?
NOT TOO MUCH PAIN?

17:54.067 --> 17:56.067
FEELING GREAT.

17:56.100 --> 18:00.333
AND... YOUR HAND--
YOUR RIGHT HAND--

18:00.367 --> 18:03.600
FEELIN' GOOD TODAY?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.500
I'M SORRY, OLIVIA,
YOU'RE JUST--

18:07.533 --> 18:09.433
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL
DR. YANG

18:09.467 --> 18:12.767
THAT I'M NOT READY
TO GIVE HER THAT INFORMATION.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.800
RIGHT.

18:14.833 --> 18:17.067
OKAY, THEN. SORRY.

18:21.133 --> 18:22.467
(whispers) GEORGE,
ASK HIM--

18:22.500 --> 18:23.833
UH-HUH. UH-HUH.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.067
ASK HIM--

18:26.100 --> 18:28.233
YOU KNOW CRISTINA'S
STALKING YOUR ROOM?
I DO.

18:28.267 --> 18:29.433
YOUR FATHER?

18:29.467 --> 18:32.633
YEAH. UM... THE SURGERY
MY DAD'S HAVING...

18:32.667 --> 18:35.567
HAS A 50% MORBIDITY RATE.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.267
OH, O'MALLEY...

18:38.300 --> 18:41.100
THAT STATISTIC,
IT MEANS 50% OF THE PEOPLE

18:41.133 --> 18:43.067
WHO UNDERGO THE SURGERY
SURVIVE.

18:43.067 --> 18:45.533
IF YOU'RE GONNA HANG
YOUR HAT ON STATISTICS,

18:45.567 --> 18:49.367
THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THEM
FROM BOTH SIDES.

18:49.400 --> 18:51.767
(Derek) HEATHER, I'VE LOOKED
AT YOUR CASE HISTORY,

18:51.800 --> 18:54.400
AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT OF VERY PAINFUL

18:54.433 --> 18:56.067
AND VERY UNSUCCESSFUL
SURGERIES,

18:56.100 --> 18:58.800
BUT IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT, I THINK
I COULD SIGNIFICANTLY HELP

18:58.833 --> 19:01.500
WITH THE SPINAL CURVATURE.
BY "HELP,"
YOU MEAN WHAT, EXACTLY?

19:01.533 --> 19:05.300
I MEAN, I THINK I CAN GET YOU
STANDING UP STRAIGHT.
ARE YOU MESSING WITH ME?

19:05.333 --> 19:07.700
'CAUSE IT'S NOT NICE
TO MOCK CRIPPLED KIDS.

19:07.733 --> 19:11.400
YOU SEE THIS--
THIS CURVED PART HERE?

19:11.433 --> 19:13.300
I'D REMOVE IT.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.533
YOU--YOU WANT TO REMOVE

19:14.567 --> 19:17.167
A PORTION
OF MY DAUGHTER'S SPINE?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.700
MM-HMM. AND I WOULD REPLACE IT
WITH A TITANIUM MESH CAGE

19:19.733 --> 19:22.167
THAT WOULD FILL IN THE SPACE
BETWEEN THE VERTEBRA.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.800
I'VE SEEN CASE STUDIES. THERE
HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW SUCCESSES.

19:24.833 --> 19:27.700
AND--AND THE ONES
THAT AREN'T SUCCESSFUL?

19:27.733 --> 19:32.267
THEY RESULT IN PARALYSIS
OR DEATH.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.533
BUT DR. SHEPHERD
IS THE BEST THERE IS.

19:34.567 --> 19:36.100
SHE'S 17.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.567
MOM, I KNOW YOU STILL THINK
DEATH IS THE WORST THING

19:39.600 --> 19:42.167
THAT CAN HAPPEN
TO A PERSON.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.433
DEATH IS NOT
THE WORST THING.

19:47.333 --> 19:50.200
I'M IN.

19:50.233 --> 19:52.633
THEY'RE GONNA CUT OUT
A PIECE OF HER SPINE--

19:52.667 --> 19:54.167
HEATHER DOUGLAS.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.533
DOCTORS SHEPHERD
AND TORRES, THEY'RE--

19:55.567 --> 19:57.067
THEY'RE GONNA STRAIGHTEN
HER SPINE.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.467
AND?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.333
AND... IT'S
A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME SURGERY.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.600
PLEASE.
SHE'S MY PATIENT.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.267
I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.200
I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO SCRUB IN.

20:07.233 --> 20:08.433
DID YOU DEPOSIT THE CHECK?

20:08.467 --> 20:10.100
IT'S MY MONEY.

20:10.133 --> 20:12.733
I SHOULD GET TO DO
WHAT I WANT WITH IT.

20:12.767 --> 20:15.767
UH, YOU GET A 5% RETURN
ON 6-MONTH CD?

20:15.800 --> 20:17.700
IN THE TIME WE'VE BEEN
STANDING HERE,

20:17.733 --> 20:19.267
YOU COULD'VE
JUST MADE $400.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.567
DR. BAILEY.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.067
IT'S NOT REASONABLE,
STEVENS.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.733
(sighs)

20:24.767 --> 20:28.200
***

20:28.233 --> 20:30.233
DAD, IT'S YOUR DISCARD.

20:30.267 --> 20:32.167
I'M SORRY ABOUT
RUNNING OVER BUCKY.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.133
WHAT?

20:33.167 --> 20:35.567
YOUR DOG.
THAT YAPPY DOG BUCKY.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.533
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
I RAN OVER HIM,

20:37.567 --> 20:40.667
AND I TOLD YOU HE RAN AWAY.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.767
YOU RAN OVER MY DOG
ON PURPOSE?

20:42.800 --> 20:45.667
OF COURSE NOT. HE WAS CHASING
AFTER THE TRUCK LIKE ALWAYS

20:45.700 --> 20:47.667
AND HE GOT CAUGHT UP
UNDER THE TIRE.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.700
(makes squishing sound)
YOU WERE SO SENSITIVE.

20:49.733 --> 20:52.833
YOU WERE SUCH A SOFT KID,
I COULDN'T BEAR TO TELL YA.

20:52.867 --> 20:54.433
I WASN'T SOFT.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.133
I MEAN IT GOOD, GEORGIE.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.333
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE KIND
AND YOU LOVED ANIMALS.

20:59.367 --> 21:02.333
YOU WERE ALWAYS LOOKING
TO HELP PEOPLE.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.700
AND I COULDN'T FACE YOU

21:03.733 --> 21:06.333
AND TELL YOU
THAT I KILLED YOUR DOG

21:06.367 --> 21:09.067
SO I TOLD YOU A LIE.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.200
I'M SAYING I'M SORRY.

21:11.233 --> 21:13.300
OKAY.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.700
(laughs)

21:14.733 --> 21:17.700
YOU'RE A GOOD KID, GEORGIE.

21:17.733 --> 21:20.567
ALWAYS BEEN
SUCH A GOOD KID.

21:22.667 --> 21:24.167
I WANT TO TELL YOU--

21:24.200 --> 21:26.500
DAD, STOP ACTING LIKE
YOU'RE DYING.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.267
YOU'RE NOT DYING, OKAY?

21:28.300 --> 21:32.133
(laughs) I WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY

21:32.167 --> 21:34.200
IF YOU LET THAT CALLIE
GET AWAY.

21:34.233 --> 21:35.533
DAD, PLEASE!

21:35.567 --> 21:37.400
NO, SHE GETS YOU.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.300
SHE GETS YOU IN A WAY
THAT YOUR FAMILY NEVER HAS.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.200
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,

21:42.233 --> 21:46.633
THAT YOU GREW UP FEELING
SO DIFFERENT ALL THE TIME.

21:46.667 --> 21:49.300
THAT'S ANOTHER THING
I'M SORRY ABOUT.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.800
DAD, STOP IT.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.733
STOP APOLOGIZING,
STOP SAYING GOOD-BYE.

21:52.767 --> 21:54.533
YOU CAN'T...

21:54.567 --> 21:56.500
THAT'S NO WAY
TO GO INTO SURGERY.

21:56.533 --> 21:58.100
***

21:58.133 --> 22:00.067
I'M GONNA DIE SOMEDAY,
GEORGIE.

22:00.067 --> 22:01.233
WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE,

22:01.267 --> 22:04.800
AND LYING HERE IN THIS BED
GIVES ME TIME TO THINK

22:04.833 --> 22:07.200
ABOUT ALL THE THINGS
I HAVEN'T SAID IS ALL.

22:07.233 --> 22:08.567
OKAY.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.067
WELL, JUST DISCARD.

22:11.100 --> 22:13.467
ANYTHING YOU WANT
TO SAY TO ME?
DAD!

22:13.500 --> 22:16.067
(laughs) ALL RIGHT.
I'M DISCARDING.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.267
***

22:19.300 --> 22:21.567
DOG MURDERER.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.200
(laughing)

22:23.233 --> 22:25.433
***

22:30.200 --> 22:31.467
TELL ME
WHAT I WANNA HEAR.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.400
IF I DIE, YOU'LL KILL ME.

22:33.433 --> 22:34.500
HE'S A QUICK STUDY.

22:34.533 --> 22:36.333
MEREDITH.

22:36.367 --> 22:37.633
HELLO.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.367
HELLO.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.167
I'M...
UH, HOW ARE YOU?

22:42.200 --> 22:45.167
GOOD. UH, BUSY WITH WORK.
WE HAVE A PATIENT.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.067
HELLO.
HELLO.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.433
HI.
HI.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.100
HI.
HI.

22:51.633 --> 22:54.167
UH, ALL RIGHT, THEN.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.633
(stammers)

22:55.667 --> 22:58.333
OH, I'M SO--
UH, NICE SEEING YOU.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.067
OKAY.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.233
THAT YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

23:04.267 --> 23:06.300
NO, THAT'S MY EX-FATHER.

23:06.333 --> 23:07.667
(monitor beeps)

23:07.700 --> 23:09.500
(Richard) YOU SEE, GREY?

23:09.533 --> 23:13.333
GOOD EXPOSURE
TO THE ESOPHAGEAL HIATUS.

23:13.367 --> 23:14.700
YES, SIR.

23:14.733 --> 23:17.733
NOW WE WILL INSPECT
AND PALPATE

23:17.767 --> 23:19.367
THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY.

23:19.400 --> 23:20.600
OH...

23:20.633 --> 23:23.100
THOSE ARE THE METS,
RIGHT?

23:23.133 --> 23:26.800
THROUGHOUT THE STOMACH,
THE CELIAC LYMPH NODES,

23:26.833 --> 23:28.633
THE LIVER.
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

23:28.667 --> 23:31.733
SO THAT'S IT?
WE'RE CLOSING HIM BACK UP?

23:33.400 --> 23:34.700
NO.

23:34.733 --> 23:37.733
WE WILL PROCEED.

23:37.767 --> 23:39.433
BUT I THOUGHT--

23:39.467 --> 23:42.133
THE PATIENT ASKED US
TO PROCEED.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.600
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

23:44.633 --> 23:47.400
THIS MAN ASKED
FOR A CHANCE TO FIGHT.

23:47.433 --> 23:49.367
WHAT IT MEANS IS...

23:49.400 --> 23:51.767
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT
LIKE HELL.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.067
BUT HE CAN RECOVER?
THERE'S A CHANCE?

23:54.067 --> 23:56.133
THERE'S A CHANCE.

23:56.167 --> 23:59.333
DR. GREY, THE REQUEST
FROM THE PATIENT...

23:59.367 --> 24:02.200
IT WAS PRIVATE.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.367
YES.

24:04.767 --> 24:06.800
OKAY.

24:12.467 --> 24:13.700
PRESTON.

24:13.733 --> 24:15.200
OH, ADDISON.

24:15.233 --> 24:16.567
HOW YOU FEELING?

24:16.600 --> 24:17.767
BETTER.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.200
LOOKING FORWARD
TO GOING HOME.

24:20.233 --> 24:22.333
WELL, I'M SURE DR. YANG
IS LOOKING FORWARD

24:22.367 --> 24:24.067
TO HAVING YOU BACK THERE
AS WELL.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.267
UH, MAYBE.
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.400
WHY WOULDN'T YOU KNOW?
WHAT...

24:29.433 --> 24:31.567
IS...

24:31.600 --> 24:33.267
IS THAT OVER?

24:33.300 --> 24:37.100
NO, IT'S NOT OVER.
IT'S JUST... SILENT.

24:37.133 --> 24:39.300
SI--OH, YEAH, YES.
I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.233
UM, ONE OF THE NURSES
WAS TALKING.

24:41.267 --> 24:42.733
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS GOSSIP.

24:42.767 --> 24:45.133
(chuckles) IT'S NOT.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.667
SO YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO HER.
WHY NOT?

24:50.867 --> 24:54.600
DID YOU EVER PLAY
SAY "UNCLE"?

24:54.633 --> 24:56.467
SAY "UNCLE"?

24:56.500 --> 24:58.400
SOMEONE BENDS YOUR ARM
BEHIND YOUR BACK

24:58.433 --> 25:00.333
HARDER AND HARDER
UNTIL YOU SAY "UNCLE."

25:00.367 --> 25:02.667
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

25:02.700 --> 25:05.067
THEN THEY HAVE ALL THE POWER.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.733
I SEE.

25:06.767 --> 25:10.067
SO YOU
ARE NOT SAYING "UNCLE."

25:10.067 --> 25:10.833
YES.

25:10.867 --> 25:12.533
AND NEITHER IS SHE.

25:13.833 --> 25:15.800
IT SEEMS THAT WAY.
THAT'S PATHETIC.

25:15.833 --> 25:17.733
(clears throat)
WELL, YOU MAY BE RIGHT.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.200
I AM RIGHT.
IF YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG,

25:20.233 --> 25:22.433
THEN YOU APOLOGIZE.

25:22.467 --> 25:25.200
WELL, I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.333
DID SHE?

25:27.367 --> 25:30.400
SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO THINK SO.

25:32.867 --> 25:35.100
THAT'S PATHETIC.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.533
HEY.

25:47.567 --> 25:50.133
HEY.

25:50.167 --> 25:52.300
YOU'RE ALL ALONE.
WHERE'S YOUR FAMILY?

25:52.333 --> 25:53.633
EATING. THEY LIKE TO EAT.

25:53.667 --> 25:56.400
MM. YOU'RE PACING.

25:56.433 --> 25:59.433
YEAH.

25:59.467 --> 26:01.767
IT'S JUST, HE'S BEEN
IN SURGERY FOR A WHILE.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.367
THAT'S GOOD. IT MEANS
THEY'RE BEING THOROUGH.

26:04.400 --> 26:06.500
OR IT MEANS
THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS.

26:06.533 --> 26:09.400
SOMEBODY WOULD'VE TOLD YOU
IF THERE WERE COMPLICATIONS.
RIGHT.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.433
IT'S OKAY TO BE SCARED.
I'M NOT SCARED.

26:11.467 --> 26:13.367
I'M JUST SAYIN',
IF YOU ARE...

26:13.400 --> 26:16.167
I'M NOT SCARED.
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.267
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

26:21.400 --> 26:24.400
OKAY, NOW I'M SCARED OF YOU.

26:24.433 --> 26:26.333
DAMN IT.
I WAS STARING YOU DOWN.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.667
STARING ME DOWN?

26:27.700 --> 26:29.200
YEAH, IT WORKED ON SHEPHERD.

26:29.233 --> 26:30.433
SERIOUSLY?

26:30.467 --> 26:33.200
WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME TRY IT AGAIN.

26:34.533 --> 26:36.233
NO, IT'S NOT...
NO?

26:36.267 --> 26:38.700
I'M STILL SCARED.
(laughs)

26:38.733 --> 26:42.400
HOLD ON.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

26:45.667 --> 26:49.400
***

26:56.633 --> 26:58.133
UH, YOU SHOULD
PREPARE YOURSELF,

26:58.167 --> 27:00.667
BECAUSE THIS IS
A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE SURGERY

27:00.700 --> 27:02.133
THAN THE HEART VALVE.

27:02.167 --> 27:04.067
THERE'S PROBABLY STILL
A TUBE IN HIS THROAT

27:04.100 --> 27:05.300
HELPING HIM BREATHE,

27:05.333 --> 27:07.733
AND HALF HIS STOMACH
WAS CUT OUT

27:07.767 --> 27:11.133
AND PART OF HIS ESOPHAGUS,
SO THERE'S GONNA BE A BIG SCAR.
OKAY.

27:11.167 --> 27:12.833
JUST... BE PREPARED.

27:12.867 --> 27:16.067

28:39.267 --> 28:40.833
HE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT THE HOSPITAL.

28:40.867 --> 28:43.733

MM-HMM.

28:43.767 --> 28:45.133
ALL NIGHT?

28:45.167 --> 28:48.367
NO. JUST AFTER

28:54.667 --> 28:56.533

ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

28:56.567 --> 28:58.467
HE USUALLY SLEEPS ON THE COUCH,
SETS AN ALARM,

28:58.500 --> 29:00.400
GETS BACK IN BED

IS THIS SOME KIND
OF JOKE?

29:53.167 --> 29:55.400
IT IS KIND OF A JOKE...

29:55.433 --> 29:59.133
A REALLY CRUEL JOKE.

29:59.167 --> 30:01.667
I'M SORRY.
YOU WANT TO DEPOSIT THIS?

30:01.700 --> 30:03.600

30:26.733 --> 30:29.167
I'M SURPRISED THEY PROCEEDED
WITH THE SURGERY.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.100
ME, TOO. I GUESS
THEY THINK HE HAS

30:31.133 --> 30:33.033
A STRONG ENOUGH CONSTITUTION
TO FIGHT THE CANCER.

30:33.067 --> 30:34.367
IS HE CONSCIOUS?

30:34.400 --> 30:38.100
STILL INTUBATED,
SO THEY HAVE HIM SEDATED.

30:38.133 --> 30:41.100
THE MAIN CONCERN
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

30:41.133 --> 30:43.733
WILL BE MULTISYSTEM
ORGAN FAILURE.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.667
THAT IS THAT THE SURGERY
WAS TOO INTENSE

30:45.700 --> 30:47.300
FOR HIS WEAKENED ORGANS
TO SUPPORT.

30:47.333 --> 30:48.667
YOU WANT TO WATCH
THE KIDNEYS

30:48.700 --> 30:50.600
BECAUSE IF THE KIDNEYS FAIL,
THAT'S A SIGN

30:50.633 --> 30:52.233
THAT EVERYTHING ELSE
IS STARTING TO GO.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.167
SO WE'RE WATCHING
THE KIDNEYS.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.800
YOU'RE WATCHING THE KIDNEYS.
THANK YOU.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.300
OH, DO YOU MIND ME ASKING,
UH, HOW'S YOUR HAND?

30:59.333 --> 31:02.133
I DON'T MIND IF YOU ASK.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.200
I WILL MIND
IF YOU TELL CRISTINA.

31:04.233 --> 31:07.067
YOU TWO HAVE
A STRANGE RELATIONSHIP.

31:07.067 --> 31:09.333
YES, WE DO.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.133
YEAH.

31:11.167 --> 31:12.367
AND WHEN YOU GO HOME,

31:12.400 --> 31:14.300
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
YOUR VERY OWN ROOM.

31:14.333 --> 31:16.067
YES, YOU DO.

31:16.100 --> 31:18.067
(laughs)

31:18.100 --> 31:20.400
AND YOUR MOM, SHE GOT
ONE OF THOSE, UM,

31:20.433 --> 31:21.767
YOU KNOW, UH, THOSE STENCILS.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.833
MM-HMM.

31:22.867 --> 31:25.333
AND SHE MADE
LITTLE BUTTERFLIES

31:25.367 --> 31:26.733
AND FLOWERS.

31:26.767 --> 31:29.333
(Thatcher laughs)

31:29.367 --> 31:31.200
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

31:31.233 --> 31:32.567
NO, I'M FINE.

31:34.667 --> 31:36.733
OH, IT GETS QUIET
IN HERE.

31:36.767 --> 31:39.100
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO PAGED ME?

31:39.133 --> 31:41.500
I STARTED MY SHIFT
TEN MINUTES AGO,

31:41.533 --> 31:43.700
NOTICED HER STOMACH LOOKED
A LITTLE DISTENDED.

31:43.733 --> 31:46.467
HER STOMACH'S DISTENDED?
I-I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT.

31:46.500 --> 31:50.533
IT'S HARD TO SEE.
PAGE DR. MONTGOMERY, STAT.

31:50.567 --> 31:52.833
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
IS THIS BAD?

31:52.867 --> 31:55.267
WELL, LET'S JUST WAIT
FOR DR. MONTGOMERY.

32:01.867 --> 32:03.233
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

32:03.267 --> 32:04.733
MY FATHER'S HERE.

32:04.767 --> 32:05.867
YOUR FATHER?

32:05.900 --> 32:09.067
THE ONE I DON'T TALK TO
AND BARELY KNOW, HE'S HERE.

32:09.100 --> 32:11.200
WHAT, IS HE HERE TO SEE YOU?

32:11.233 --> 32:13.567
NO. HE'S HERE
WITH HIS OTHER FAMILY.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.200
OH, SORRY.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.733
WHERE DO YOU SLEEP
AT THE TRAILER?

32:20.767 --> 32:22.433
WHAT?

32:22.467 --> 32:26.767
WHEN WE SLEEP AT THE TRAILER,
WHERE DO YOU SLEEP?

32:26.800 --> 32:30.600
YOU KNOW
THE HAMMOCK OUTSIDE?

32:30.633 --> 32:33.700
SORRY.

32:33.733 --> 32:35.633
I'M A GIRL
WITH ABANDONMENT ISSUES.

32:35.667 --> 32:38.133
YOU HAVE TO SLEEP
WITH ME FROM NOW ON.

32:38.167 --> 32:41.533
OKAY.

32:41.567 --> 32:44.700
OKAY.

32:44.733 --> 32:46.633
A NOTE FROM MY HACK
OF A SHRINK.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.567
I GET TO SCRUB IN.
NOT TILL I SAY SO.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.133
I DEPOSITED
THE DAMN CHECK.

32:50.167 --> 32:52.633
YOU CHEAP
SON OF A BITCH BASTARDS

32:52.667 --> 32:55.533
ARE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL--
STRAIGHT TO HELL!

32:55.567 --> 32:57.633
(closes cell phone)
MS. DOUGLAS?

32:57.667 --> 32:59.633
INSURANCE BASTARDS.

32:59.667 --> 33:01.567
THEY SAY THE SURGERY'S
TOO EXPERIMENTAL.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.633
THEY WON'T PAY.

33:03.667 --> 33:05.567
IT'S A $200,000 SURGERY,

33:05.600 --> 33:08.833
PLUS A HOSPITAL STAY,
PLUS REHAB.

33:08.867 --> 33:11.267
EVEN IF I GET THREE JOBS...

33:11.300 --> 33:13.600
SON OF A BITCH BASTARDS.

33:13.633 --> 33:16.767
LOOKS LIKE THERE WON'T BE
A SURGERY TO SCRUB IN ON.

33:16.800 --> 33:18.800
SORRY, STEVENS.

33:18.833 --> 33:21.433
TALK TO ME.
HER ABDOMEN WAS DISTENDED

33:21.467 --> 33:23.633
AND SHE NEEDED INCREASED
VENTILATORY SUPPORT,

33:23.667 --> 33:25.467
SO I ORDERED SOME X-RAYS.
I'M SORRY. I WAS TALKING
TO HER. I DIDN'T NOTICE.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.400
SHE'S GOT MASSIVE FREE AIR
TRAPPED BENEATH HER DIAPHRAGM.

33:27.433 --> 33:29.133
MR. GREY, WE NEED TO GET
LAURA INTO SURGERY.

33:29.167 --> 33:33.367
WHAT? ANOTHER SURGERY?
WHY?
HER X-RAYS INDICATE THERE'S
A PERFORATION IN THE BOWEL.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.800
WE NEED TO GET IN THERE
RIGHT AWAY.
HERE'S A CONSENT FORM.
WE NEED YOU TO SIGN IT.

33:35.833 --> 33:38.233
I DON'T--I--
I DON'T KNOW...

33:38.267 --> 33:40.800
HER--HER MOTHER
HAS THE FLU.

33:40.833 --> 33:42.700
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
AUTHORIZED TO SIGN?
I AM.

33:42.733 --> 33:44.633
BUT I--I'D LIKE TO
FILL HER IN--

33:44.667 --> 33:47.533
WE DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR YOU TO NOT KNOW, MR. GREY.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.467
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER
DOESN'T HAVE TIME.

33:49.500 --> 33:52.467
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
(sighs)

33:56.367 --> 33:58.433
TAKE OUT MORE OF THE BOWEL.
I NEED BETTER VISUALIZATION.

33:58.467 --> 34:00.367
IT'S SO TINY, I'M AFRAID
I MIGHT CRUSH IT.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.667
OH, IT'S TOUGHER
THAN YOU THINK.

34:02.700 --> 34:05.133
GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT
A LITTLE SQUEEZE.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.833
COOL. THANKS. HMM.

34:08.867 --> 34:10.500
LOOK AT THAT.

34:10.533 --> 34:13.700
THE N.G. TUBE HAS ERODED
RIGHT THROUGH THE STOMACH WALL.

34:13.733 --> 34:15.100
I MAY HAVE TO RESECT

34:15.133 --> 34:16.633
AN ENTIRE PORTION
OF THE STOMACH.
(monitor beeping erratically)

34:16.667 --> 34:19.800
SHE'S HYPOTENSIVE.
PUSH 30 ccs OF ALBUMIN.

34:19.833 --> 34:22.467
(beeping continues)

34:25.367 --> 34:28.067
(monitor beeping rhythmically)
WHEW.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.167
(exhales)

34:29.200 --> 34:30.167
SCARY.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.700
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

34:31.733 --> 34:34.333
THIS IS
MEREDITH'S GREY'S NIECE.

34:34.367 --> 34:37.233
IF I LOST HER, PEOPLE MIGHT
THINK I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

34:37.267 --> 34:39.600
(laughs)

34:45.267 --> 34:46.433
(Richard) HOW'S IT GOING?

34:46.467 --> 34:48.767
OKAY. THEY HAD A SCARE
A MINUTE AGO,

34:48.800 --> 34:50.700
BUT SHE STABILIZED.

34:50.733 --> 34:56.600
YOUR, UH, FATHER IS PACING
UP AND DOWN THE HALLS.

34:56.633 --> 34:58.600
HE'S WORRIED.

34:58.633 --> 35:01.233
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE HIM
AN UPDATE.

35:01.267 --> 35:04.567
MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE HIM
AN UPDATE.

35:06.067 --> 35:09.333
HE'S NOT A BIG FAN
OF MINE.

35:09.367 --> 35:11.267
HE'S NOT A BIG FAN
OF MINE EITHER.

35:11.300 --> 35:13.433
OH, I CAN'T IMAGINE
THAT'S TRUE.

35:16.833 --> 35:19.833
YOUR MOTHER WAS A FORCE
TO BE RECKONED WITH.

35:19.867 --> 35:22.733
IF SHE WANTED THINGS
A CERTAIN WAY, I...

35:24.767 --> 35:27.633
I'M SAYING YOUR FATHER
WAS A GOOD MAN WHEN I KNEW HIM.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.767
HE MAY HAVE A SIDE IN THIS THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.667
WHAT, YOU THINK HE TRIED
TO SEND ME A CARD EVERY YEAR

35:33.700 --> 35:35.600
AND MY MOTHER
HAS A WHOLE DRAWER

35:35.633 --> 35:38.133
FULL OF UNOPENED CARDS?

35:38.167 --> 35:39.533
BECAUSE IT'S NOT OFTEN

35:39.567 --> 35:41.733
THAT MY LIFE
TURNS OUT THAT WAY.

35:41.767 --> 35:44.600
I DON'T KNOW.

35:44.633 --> 35:47.467
YOU DON'T KNOW EITHER
UNTIL YOU ASK HIM.

35:51.700 --> 35:53.433
(clears throat)

35:53.467 --> 35:55.500
(Callie) HEY.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.267
HOW'S HE DOING?

35:57.300 --> 36:00.200
UH, GEORGIE IS OBSESSED
WITH OUR DAD'S PEE.

36:00.233 --> 36:02.267
(Ronnie) YEAH, THIS IS WEIRD,
EVEN FOR GEORGIE.

36:02.300 --> 36:04.267
BOYS, BE NICE.
(George)
IT'S HIS KIDNEY FUNCTION.

36:04.300 --> 36:07.067
I'M OBSESSED WITH HIS
KIDNEY FUNCTION, NOT HIS PEE.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.700
AND I'M NOT OBSESSED.

36:08.733 --> 36:10.733
I'M EXCITED.

36:10.767 --> 36:13.400
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DRINK THAT,
ARE YOU, GEORGIE?

36:13.433 --> 36:15.500
130 ccs!

36:15.533 --> 36:17.433
130 ccs OF SHINY,
YELLOW URINE!

36:17.467 --> 36:19.500
130 ccs IN HOW LONG?

36:19.533 --> 36:21.433
FOUR HOURS.
NO WAY!

36:21.467 --> 36:23.433
THAT IS FANTASTIC!

36:23.467 --> 36:26.500
YEAH! YEAH!
THANK YOU!

36:26.533 --> 36:29.700
* UH-HUH,
UH-HUH, UH-HUH *

36:29.733 --> 36:31.800
MM.

36:31.833 --> 36:34.333
THANK YOU.

36:34.367 --> 36:37.367
THANK YOU.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.700
MARK.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.367
I'M SORRY YOU'RE HURTING.

36:47.400 --> 36:51.400
YOU'RE SORRY I'M HURTING
OR YOU'RE SORRY?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.600
(Addison) KAREV.

37:03.633 --> 37:05.100
OH. HEY.

37:05.133 --> 37:08.333
I WAS, UH, JUST CHECKING
THE BABY'S CAPILLARY REFILLS--

37:08.367 --> 37:10.467
NO, IT'S GOOD,
IT'S GOOD.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.400
WE ALL NEED
A LITTLE HUMAN CONTACT

37:12.433 --> 37:14.500
FROM TIME TO TIME.

37:14.533 --> 37:15.733
IT SUCKS.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.367
IT'S LIKE SHE HASN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO DESERVE THIS,

37:18.400 --> 37:20.500
YOU KNOW?

37:20.533 --> 37:23.400
IS THAT WHY YOU WANT
TO GO INTO PLASTICS,

37:23.433 --> 37:26.700
'CAUSE PEOPLE SIGN UP
FOR THE PAIN THEY GET?

37:26.733 --> 37:28.567
YEAH.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.200
FOR THE MOST PART,
THEY DO, YEAH.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.833
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:34.867 --> 37:39.233
IT DOES SUCK
WATCHING THEM STRUGGLE.

37:39.267 --> 37:42.633
AND THAT PART
NEVER STOPS SUCKING.

37:42.667 --> 37:46.733
BUT... THEN WHEN YOU GET
TO SEE A BABY HEAL

37:46.767 --> 37:49.400
AND, UM...
THEY GET TO GO HOME

37:49.433 --> 37:52.233
AND... YOU JUST IMAGINE

37:52.267 --> 37:54.267
THIS WHOLE LIFE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA LIVE,

37:54.300 --> 37:57.133
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER
THAN THAT.

37:57.167 --> 38:00.333
AND THAT PART
NEVER CHANGES.

38:00.367 --> 38:04.500
BUT... IF YOU WANT
TO GO BACK TO PLASTICS...

38:04.533 --> 38:06.800
NAH.

38:06.833 --> 38:08.633
THE VANILLA LATTE?

38:08.667 --> 38:11.067
I DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

38:11.067 --> 38:13.733
(chuckles) WHY?

38:13.767 --> 38:17.467
'CAUSE HE WAS RUDE
TO YOU.

38:17.500 --> 38:20.500
***

38:23.467 --> 38:25.133
OH.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.700
I'M, UH, SORRY.

38:26.733 --> 38:28.200
NO, I'M SORRY.

38:28.233 --> 38:30.133
SORRY.
GOSH, I'M... REALLY SORRY.

38:30.167 --> 38:32.067
NO, I'M OKAY.
I'M, UH, I'M JUST, UM...

38:32.100 --> 38:33.567
I'M GONNA--

38:33.600 --> 38:35.700
YEAH, OKAY. YEAH. YEAH.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.700
(Travis' "Love Will
Come Through" playing)

38:41.267 --> 38:43.333
OH, HEY.
YOU NEED SOME HELP?

38:43.367 --> 38:45.233
I CAN WALK
TO THE BATHROOM MYSELF.

38:45.267 --> 38:47.167
I'VE BEEN DOING IT
MY WHOLE LIFE,

38:47.200 --> 38:49.200
AND NOTHING'S CHANGING
ANY TIME SOON,

38:49.233 --> 38:52.533
SO JUST GET OUT
OF MY WAY, OKAY?

38:52.567 --> 38:56.100
* AND I CAN'T LIVE ALONE
IN THIS LIE *

38:56.133 --> 38:58.733
