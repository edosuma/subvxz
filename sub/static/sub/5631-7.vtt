00:06.140 --> 00:07.075
male announcer:
In the criminal justice system,

00:09.077 --> 00:11.745
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.482
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.482 --> 00:16.250
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.250 --> 00:17.851
are members of an elite squad

00:17.851 --> 00:19.420
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.555
These are their stories.

00:22.923 --> 00:26.827
- I make this solemn vow
to you and my creator...

00:26.827 --> 00:30.698
both: I make this solemn vow
to you and my creator...

00:30.698 --> 00:32.032
- To keep my thoughts
virtuous...

00:32.032 --> 00:34.235
- To keep my thoughts
virtuous...

00:34.235 --> 00:36.537
- And abstain
from all sexual activity...

00:36.537 --> 00:39.006
- And to abstain
from all sexual activity...

00:39.006 --> 00:41.375
- Until the day
you give me to my husband.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.844
- Until the day
you give me to my husband.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.746
- Frank.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.016
- I promise to teach you,
to guide you,

00:49.016 --> 00:52.453
and protect the purity
of your mind, body, and soul.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.961
Lane: I'm so excited to take
this pledge of purity.

01:00.961 --> 01:02.663
- The Virtue Ball celebrates

01:02.663 --> 01:05.299
the sacred father-daughter
relationship.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.767
- Until the girls get married,

01:06.767 --> 01:08.969
it's my duty
to protect their purity.

01:08.969 --> 01:11.639
- We're off to New York City
for my Virtue Ball.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.608
I'm so excited.

01:14.608 --> 01:18.045
I get to wear the same dress
Tymber and Summer wore.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.448
[upbeat music]

01:20.448 --> 01:22.383
It sure is busier here
than Allanville.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.785
- Hey, Lane, Summer,
I could use a hand.

01:24.785 --> 01:27.455
- Oh, sorry, Graham.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.390
- It isn't easy
with a big family,

01:29.390 --> 01:31.392
but we always pull it together.

01:31.392 --> 01:32.526
Lane: It's important for girls

01:32.526 --> 01:33.527
to save themselves
for marriage.

01:33.527 --> 01:36.430
- New York City.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.965
- Hi!

01:37.965 --> 01:41.369
- I do love you in a tux.
- The ring--I can't find it.

01:41.369 --> 01:45.873
- Okay, you gave it to Graham
to hold, remember?

01:45.873 --> 01:48.209
Relax, Frank.

01:48.209 --> 01:52.446
This is gonna be
so magical for Lane.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.816
She'll never forget this night
and her daddy.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.586
- Let's put your hair up
like this.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.887
- Yes.

01:59.887 --> 02:02.190
Do you think Daddy
will approve?

02:02.190 --> 02:06.794
- Girls,
look what I have.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.196
Lane: Taking this pledge
of purity

02:08.196 --> 02:09.597
is an important step
in my life.

02:09.597 --> 02:13.201
- Now, close your eyes.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.736
Isn't it beautiful?

02:15.736 --> 02:18.706
Lane: Today, I am promising
to save myself for marriage.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.210
[clinking]

02:22.210 --> 02:24.445
- May I have your attention,
please?

02:24.445 --> 02:27.315
At this time, we would like
to invite all fathers

02:27.315 --> 02:29.350
to escort their daughters
onto the floor

02:29.350 --> 02:30.684
for a special dance.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.685
Frank: It's important
for a girl

02:31.685 --> 02:33.421
to feel love and acceptance.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.223
If she's not getting that
from her father,

02:35.223 --> 02:37.558
then she seeks it out
from other men.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.760
- * Beneath
the pale moonlight *

02:39.760 --> 02:41.695
Lane: Whatever comes,
if we keep pure hearts

02:41.695 --> 02:44.798
and pure minds,
we will overcome any obstacles.

02:44.798 --> 02:47.301
Our family puts commitment
to godly values first.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.237
- You look beautiful
tonight, Lane.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.239
Lane: We keep each other safe
and free from sin in life.

02:51.239 --> 02:52.240
Thank you, Daddy.

02:52.240 --> 02:53.474
There are always temptations.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.775
- * Somewhere out there

02:54.775 --> 02:56.877
- I took my oath
three years ago.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.712
I remember it so well.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.582
I wear my promise ring
every day.

03:01.582 --> 03:03.284
- I'm very blessed.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.953
The only man
I've ever kissed is my husband.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.021
- But, boy, have we made up
for lost time.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.759
- [laughs]
Mm.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.027
- Do you want to say anything,
Graham?

03:14.027 --> 03:16.096
- Yeah, when do we get
to eat the cake?

03:16.096 --> 03:19.633
- * Even though I know
how very far apart we are *

03:19.633 --> 03:21.302
- Summer, honey,
are you watching your brother?

03:21.302 --> 03:23.036
- Sorry, Mama.
Tate.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.372
- I'll get him.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.274
- The little ones
are very spirited.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.276
- * And when the night wind
starts to sing *

03:28.276 --> 03:29.910
* A lonesome lullaby

03:29.910 --> 03:31.912
- So are the big ones.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.382
- * It helps to think
we're sleeping underneath *

03:34.382 --> 03:35.883
- I mean it,
you're so beautiful.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.285
Just like your mother.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.887
- Daddy, stop.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.955
Daddy, stop.
Daddy, no, Daddy.

03:41.955 --> 03:44.825
Please, please stop.
Daddy.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.794
- Whoa, whoa--oh, okay.

03:46.794 --> 03:49.062
- Let me see her.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.097
- No--Lane?

03:51.432 --> 03:53.867
Lane!
Lane.

03:56.404 --> 03:57.738
- She's out cold.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.640
- Water, get her some water.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.841
- I'll call 911.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.577
- Lane, honey, Mommy is here.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.716
- Hey, Lieutenant,
how was your weekend?

04:08.716 --> 04:10.050
- Well,
it was good till now.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.485
The press find out yet?

04:11.485 --> 04:13.321
- No,
but America's favorite family--

04:13.321 --> 04:14.722
it's just a matter of time.

04:14.722 --> 04:15.989
- Okay,
which daughter is it?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.558
- Lane Baker.
Number four of ten.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.427
She passed out
at her Virtue Ball.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.028
- Her Virtue Ball?
- Yeah,

04:21.028 --> 04:22.663
it's a dance where daughters
promise their fathers

04:22.663 --> 04:24.231
they'll stay virgins
until they get married.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.899
- So much for that promise.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.901
Doc says Lane
is three months pregnant.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.720
[dramatic music]

05:29.430 --> 05:29.563
.

05:31.131 --> 05:31.999
- We appreciate you
being here, officers,

05:33.534 --> 05:35.002
but we didn't call the police.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.170
- Right, the doctor did.
She has to.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.007
There's mandatory reporting
in these situations, so...

05:40.007 --> 05:43.043
Your daughter Lane is 13,
and she's pregnant.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.745
- We're aware of that now,

05:44.745 --> 05:46.914
and this is complicated,
but it's a family matter.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.148
- We need to talk to her.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.017
- We're gonna have to say no.

05:50.017 --> 05:54.154
We...we don't want her
talking to the police now.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.089
She's not well.
She's upset.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.825
This is--no...

05:57.825 --> 06:01.995
- What my wife means is that
we need to talk to Lane first.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.664
She doesn't even know
she's pregnant.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.733
- But she knows
how she got pregnant.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.334
Does Lane have
a boyfriend?

06:07.334 --> 06:09.236
- No.
Our children don't date.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.906
- Not to sound rude,
but we don't need your help.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.075
She's our daughter.
We'll take care of her.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.645
- Mrs. Baker,
we have a job to do, right,

06:17.645 --> 06:19.012
and your daughter's condition

06:19.012 --> 06:21.449
could be the result
of a criminal act.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.317
- If Lane had been
hurt in any way,

06:24.317 --> 06:26.854
she would have told us.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.156
- No signs of ongoing trauma.

06:29.156 --> 06:31.091
Low blood pressure
caused the fainting,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.126
but otherwise, she's healthy.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.529
- Did Lane say anything to you
while you were examining her?

06:35.529 --> 06:38.466
- Without violating
confidentiality,

06:38.466 --> 06:41.101
I can tell you
that she didn't get a chance.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.204
Her mother and father
were with her every second.

06:44.204 --> 06:47.541
- We're good parents.
We watch over our children.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.209
- With all due respect,

06:49.209 --> 06:52.179
this wasn't an immaculate
conception, all right?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.781
Now, to your knowledge,

06:53.781 --> 06:55.783
has your daughter been
alone with any boys?

06:55.783 --> 06:58.051
- No.
- How about at school?

06:58.051 --> 06:59.487
- We homeschool.

06:59.487 --> 07:02.790
We believe in
a faith-based education.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.525
Pastor Eldon.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.359
- Pam, Frank.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.095
I came as soon as I could.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.697
How is Lane?
- Pastor Eldon,

07:09.697 --> 07:11.632
this is Detective Tutuola
and Lieutenant Benson.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.067
They're with SVU.
- We're also very concerned

07:14.067 --> 07:16.269
about Lane.
- O-okay.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.038
- They want to talk to her,
Pastor.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.240
- Oh, I think
that Frank and Pam

07:20.240 --> 07:22.209
and Lane
would be more comfortable

07:22.209 --> 07:23.744
talking
to the local authorities.

07:23.744 --> 07:27.781
But rest assured,
as their pastor and lawyer,

07:27.781 --> 07:30.317
I will contact
the Allanville PD.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.256
- I've got to say
it is extremely frustrating.

07:36.256 --> 07:40.393
I mean, they did promise to
take it up with their local PD,

07:40.393 --> 07:42.896
but it seems like they don't
trust outsiders very much.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.231
- Maybe they're just protective
of their kids.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.633
- You mean
their brand.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.800
Look at what happened
with the Duggars.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.335
Word gets out that

07:48.335 --> 07:50.771
one of those virgin
Baker daughters is knocked up,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.673
there goes the TV show,
the book deal,

07:52.673 --> 07:54.341
the multimillion dollar
chastity empire.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.743
- Rollins,
these people,

07:55.743 --> 07:57.144
they take their faith
very seriously,

07:57.144 --> 07:58.679
and they're entitled
to their beliefs.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.814
- All right, not to interrupt
a theological debate,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.183
but given the fact that there's
no evidence of an assault--

08:03.183 --> 08:04.985
no complaint
from the girl or her parents--

08:04.985 --> 08:06.587
I mean, why are we pursuing?

08:06.587 --> 08:09.022
- She's 13, Dodds.
It's statutory rape.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.259
- Yeah, I know that,
but I've been here before.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.162
The Hasidim in Crown Heights,
these religious communities--

08:15.162 --> 08:16.897
they...close ranks.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.833
- Which is exactly
why we don't let it go.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.703
Lane lives
in an insular environment.

08:22.703 --> 08:26.607
Whoever got her pregnant
is a predator with access.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.176
- Yeah, access outside
of our jurisdiction.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.411
You want me to put in a call
to Allanville PD, Lieutenant?

08:31.411 --> 08:33.581
- Local celebrities
in a small town?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.582
I don't think
they're gonna be much help.

08:34.582 --> 08:36.449
- I may have found
something.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.886
Their entire life
is an open blog.

08:38.886 --> 08:41.121
You guys said
that the doctors think

08:41.121 --> 08:43.256
that Lane is 10 to 12
weeks pregnant, right?

08:43.256 --> 08:45.693
Which means
it happened probably...

08:45.693 --> 08:48.128
- September or August.
- In July, right?

08:48.128 --> 08:50.197
When they were here,
in Harlem,

08:50.197 --> 08:51.632
doing some mission work.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.601
Lane and some of her siblings.
Look.

08:53.601 --> 08:58.071
- That's probable cause for
statutory rape in New York City.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.406
- You want me and Carisi

08:59.406 --> 09:01.374
to take another run
at them in the hospital?

09:01.374 --> 09:03.476
- Amanda, you're on desk duty.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.113
- I'm at the hospital
every week.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.348
Come on.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.018
I'm the only one here that's
actually seen this reality show.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.786
- Nice try, Amanda.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.722
So, Dodds,

09:14.722 --> 09:18.692
you've had experience with
insular religious communities?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.327
- Okay, let's go.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.196
- Fin, you can go with.

09:31.038 --> 09:33.641
- Is the Lieutenant
always this proactive?

09:33.641 --> 09:35.676
- There a problem?

09:35.676 --> 09:38.879
- It's just when this happened
with the Hasidim in Brooklyn,

09:38.879 --> 09:41.514
the DA called us off.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.652
It's like my father says--
pick your battles.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.219
- Liv's been doing this
a while.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.657
If she thinks
something's wrong, it is.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.993
- Lane Baker.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.394
She was discharged
this morning.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.929
- By Dr. Sloane?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.865
- Uh...no.
Oh.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.233
I see there's a note here saying
we were supposed to call you.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.835
Sorry.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.237
- How long ago
did she leave?

10:09.677 --> 10:11.779
- Here, stop that, here.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.547
- Parky,
give me the biggest ones first.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.050
- We had a wonderful time
in New York,

10:17.050 --> 10:19.452
but I am ready to trade in
the Big Apple

10:19.452 --> 10:21.789
for some fresh-picked
farm apples.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.191
- Mr. and Mrs. Baker,
glad we caught you.

10:24.191 --> 10:27.227
- Sergeant Dodds,
Manhattan SVU.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.296
- All right, guys,
let's, uh...

10:29.296 --> 10:31.732
let's take a break
for five minutes here.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.267
- How you holding up?
Rough night.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.970
- It was,
but we all prayed together.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.438
- We're on the road home now.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.273
- Lane's well enough
to travel.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.375
I'm glad to hear that, but we
still need to talk to her.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.477
- Well, like Pastor Eldon
told you,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.047
we'll deal with
all of this in Allanville.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.216
- She was in New York
in July, right?

10:49.216 --> 10:51.118
- Yes, on a mission.
- Three months ago.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.820
That means she could have
gotten pregnant here.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.955
- If you have a predator
in your circle,

10:54.955 --> 10:57.090
you definitely want our help
with that.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.292
- Look, we're all on
the same side here,

10:59.292 --> 11:01.729
and we're starting
to draw a crowd.

11:01.729 --> 11:04.765
The last thing any of us wants
is for this to go public.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.533
Why don't you all
come down to the station?

11:11.371 --> 11:12.806
- It's okay.
- Here you go.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.407
- We're not supposed to
drink soda.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.243
- All right,
suit yourself.

11:16.243 --> 11:18.345
- My brother's cold.
Do you have a blanket?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.180
- Yeah, one sec.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.082
Sure I have something.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.817
Here you go.
Here you go, Tate.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.853
Nice and warm.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.855
Okay, for the rest of you,

11:27.855 --> 11:31.859
show of hands--
who's allowed to eat pizza?

11:31.859 --> 11:33.927
Huh, what about you?
- Me.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.363
- All right,
that's what I'm talking about.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.531
- Can we get pepperoni?
- You got it.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.267
Two large pies coming up.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.903
Hey, Graham, why don't you
come help me order?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
- Wow, you keep prisoners
in there?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.279
- Yeah, sometimes.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.281
So, um...

11:54.281 --> 11:56.884
you know what's going on
with your sister, right?

11:56.884 --> 11:59.286
- Yeah, but I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.354
- That's okay. Just let me
ask you one question, though.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.156
Were you with her in New York
this July?

12:03.156 --> 12:05.492
- Yeah.
We were painting over graffiti.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.628
- Did you see anybody,
like guys, kind of hovering?

12:08.628 --> 12:11.264
Did you ever see Lane
alone with anybody?

12:11.264 --> 12:14.802
- No, it was just us,
Team Baker and the crew.

12:14.802 --> 12:19.372
But really, I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.441
I'm kind of hungry.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.810
- I hear you.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.845
Let's go order those pizzas.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
- I'd feel more comfortable

12:26.279 --> 12:28.315
if either Pam
or myself was with Lane.

12:28.315 --> 12:29.983
- It's procedure, Mr. Baker.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.584
- Till we get this
figured out.

12:34.021 --> 12:36.890
- Your husband doesn't mind you
working with all these men?

12:36.890 --> 12:39.226
- It's not an issue.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.863
- How far along are you,
8 1/2 months?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.164
- Yep.

12:44.164 --> 12:46.033
I guess you'd know.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.468
- You're not wearing
your wedding ring.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.603
That can happen
with the swelling.

12:52.739 --> 12:56.676
- I know my being pregnant
is God's will.

12:56.676 --> 12:57.911
I just didn't think God

12:57.911 --> 13:00.447
would let it happen
until I was married.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.752
- But you do know how you
got pregnant,

13:05.752 --> 13:07.054
right, Lane?

13:07.054 --> 13:11.391
- I had sexual activity.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.861
- When you were on your mission
here in New York?

13:16.429 --> 13:17.898
It's okay, Lane.

13:17.898 --> 13:22.302
Whatever happened...
it's not your fault.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.505
You didn't do
anything wrong.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.909
- That's what he told me--

13:28.909 --> 13:30.878
that I was still a good person.

13:30.878 --> 13:33.680
- You are.
There's no doubt about it.

13:36.884 --> 13:40.320
I just need to know the name
of the person who told you that.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.789
- I can't say.

13:42.789 --> 13:47.127
- Because he made you
promise not to tell?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.963
- Yes, I was here in July,
up in East Harlem.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.498
- And who all went?

13:51.498 --> 13:53.200
- Tymber, Lane, Parky, Graham,

13:53.200 --> 13:54.634
and the crew.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.769
- Not your wife?
- No, she stayed upstate.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.506
Why do you ask?
- Just a question.

13:59.506 --> 14:03.176
- Maybe I should try
calling Pastor Eldon again.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.913
- Oh, well, you can,
but...

14:05.913 --> 14:07.915
you didn't do anything wrong
here, right?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.182
- Of course not.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.085
- Well, then you
don't need a lawyer.

14:12.085 --> 14:16.689
- I'm gonna ask you
a few questions, all right?

14:16.689 --> 14:19.626
But I'm not gonna
ask you to name any names,

14:19.626 --> 14:22.095
so you don't have
to break your promise, okay?

14:24.531 --> 14:27.134
Was it somebody
that you knew?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.304
- Yes.

14:31.304 --> 14:34.807
- Was it someone...

14:34.807 --> 14:36.409
in your family?

14:36.409 --> 14:39.146
- What?

14:39.146 --> 14:40.680
Don't say that.
- Okay.

14:46.653 --> 14:50.790
Lane, was it somebody
that works with your family?

14:50.790 --> 14:55.462
- He wouldn't hurt me.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.397
He loves me.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.433
- He loves you?

15:00.433 --> 15:05.572
Okay, then in that case he's not
gonna get into any trouble.

15:07.874 --> 15:09.709
- I did promise.

15:09.709 --> 15:14.214
- You promised not to say.

15:14.214 --> 15:18.986
So how about
you write it down,

15:18.986 --> 15:21.754
and that way you're not
breaking your promise.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.096
- Whatever trouble she's in,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.731
they'll just ship her off
to some mission out of state,

15:31.731 --> 15:34.567
and we'll be up and running
in about a week or so.

15:34.567 --> 15:38.071
- Pete Matthews.
- Yep.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.173
What's this about?
- We need a DNA sample.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.608
- Open your mouth.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.842
- [scoffs]

15:42.842 --> 15:44.711
Do you guys have a warrant?

15:44.711 --> 15:46.179
- Yeah, here you go.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.381
We also got one for
your cameras, your computers,

15:48.381 --> 15:51.251
your editing bay, and everything
you shot this season.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.121
- Well, I got a right
to know what this is all about.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.422
- Like you don't know.

16:04.064 --> 16:04.197
.

16:05.832 --> 16:06.499
- Pete Matthews
did this to Lane?

16:08.268 --> 16:10.037
Our cameraman?

16:10.037 --> 16:12.639
- What can you tell me
about him?

16:12.639 --> 16:16.543
- He's one of
our long-term crew members.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.112
Our kids grew up with him.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.514
We trusted him.

16:21.514 --> 16:25.652
- Unfortunately, that's not that
unusual in these situations.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.188
Has Lane ever
said anything before?

16:28.188 --> 16:31.624
- No, but if Lane is saying
that he did this,

16:31.624 --> 16:33.060
then he did this.

16:33.060 --> 16:36.296
We raise our children
to tell the truth.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.664
- What did she say he did?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.332
- We didn't press her
for details.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.135
She's very reluctant.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.537
- That son of a--
Is he here?

16:44.537 --> 16:46.306
I want five minutes
alone with him.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.241
- You need to let us handle
this--we'll talk to him.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.878
- Talk? Who would admit
to something like this?

16:51.878 --> 16:53.980
My daughter testifying--
that can't happen.

16:53.980 --> 16:58.218
- If it were me, I'd want
to rip his head off too,

16:58.218 --> 17:03.256
but there is something you
can do to help us nail this guy.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.293
- An amnio?
I'm sorry, no.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.895
- It could prove
that Pete is guilty of rape.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.663
Your daughter is very young.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.632
You don't want
to put her through a trial.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.000
- Of course I don't.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.669
- So if we can prove
the paternity, right,

17:16.669 --> 17:18.571
that's statutory rape
by definition.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.773
He'll do time,
and then your daughter

17:20.773 --> 17:24.177
is spared what can be
a very traumatic experience.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.578
- You don't understand.

17:25.578 --> 17:29.149
An amnio can threaten the life
of the unborn child.

17:29.149 --> 17:32.285
- It's a very small risk.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.454
I mean, there are other
simple blood tests

17:34.454 --> 17:35.655
that can help determine--

17:35.655 --> 17:37.490
- No, no.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.692
Nothing invasive.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.296
We don't believe
in any of that.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.199
- Well, Mrs. Baker,

17:46.199 --> 17:49.536
we could wait six months
until the baby's born,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.204
but we can't hold Pete.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.307
So that gives him
plenty of time to disappear,

17:54.307 --> 17:57.043
and he could get away
with this.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.146
- You have to find
another way.

17:59.146 --> 18:02.149
Why don't you get him
to confess?

18:03.583 --> 18:06.553
- You have other daughters.

18:06.553 --> 18:10.056
Have they said anything
to you about him?

18:10.056 --> 18:12.925
If he did assault Lane,

18:12.925 --> 18:16.263
this may not be the first time
he's done this.

18:17.530 --> 18:22.602
- You mean...
Tymber or Summer?

18:22.602 --> 18:23.903
- That song
was so beautiful today.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.439
- Yeah.

18:26.439 --> 18:30.210
- Yeah, okay.
I...realize this looks bad.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.712
- Looks?
No, no, it is bad.

18:32.712 --> 18:35.182
You're in possession
of child pornography.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.049
- Child pornography?
What are you talking about?

18:37.049 --> 18:39.452
They're teenagers, and they're
just getting dressed.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.788
- More like undressed.
Summer's 15.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.656
This is a federal charge.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.293
- Look, I'm supposed to have
cameras on them all the time.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.961
Everywhere. Okay?
I mean, you're right.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.631
I-I...should have erased that.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.900
So, okay,
lesson learned on my part.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.268
- Just how you learned
how to turn the camera off

18:55.268 --> 18:56.769
while you raped Lane?

18:56.769 --> 18:59.906
- Listen, I already told you
I did not do that.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.374
Come on, she's a child.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.410
- You know what,
you can lie to us all you want,

19:03.410 --> 19:05.212
but she's pregnant,

19:05.212 --> 19:07.780
and when that baby's DNA
comes in, your life is over.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.485
- Oh, okay.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.522
So...she's really pregnant?

19:15.522 --> 19:16.989
- You're happy about that?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.425
- Yeah,
I'm happy about that,

19:18.425 --> 19:20.092
because I couldn't
get her pregnant.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.029
I had a vasectomy
ten years ago, guys.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.432
- Your doctor can confirm that?

19:25.432 --> 19:26.533
- Absolutely.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.601
I didn't do it.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.937
- Why would Lane say
that you did?

19:30.937 --> 19:35.074
- I've been going
over that in my head.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.677
She's a good girl.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.612
She does what she's told,

19:39.612 --> 19:42.949
and this family
protects their own.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.285
- What do you mean?

19:45.285 --> 19:48.555
- I've got footage
in the Cloud going way back.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.957
If I may,
let me show it to you,

19:50.957 --> 19:53.460
and, uh,
you'll see what's going on.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.263
- So now this guy's trying
to pin this on someone else.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.564
- Yeah, he is a creep,
but maybe he's the type

19:57.564 --> 19:59.299
who looks but doesn't touch.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.768
- Well, Lane wrote his name
down, and she's not backing off.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.135
- But I was in there.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.637
I was trying
to get more details.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.273
She gave nothing else.
Not when. Not where.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.375
- Okay, maybe the creep
is right,

20:08.375 --> 20:10.310
and Lane is covering
for somebody, like her father.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.245
I mean, they were
in New York together.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.381
- It's not the father.
It's the brother.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.383
- Yeah, based on the footage
Pete just showed us,

20:16.383 --> 20:18.117
the older brother,
Graham, well,

20:18.117 --> 20:19.452
he's got some issues.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.488
This is Summer
with the piano teacher.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.290
[piano notes]

20:23.290 --> 20:25.425
- Bet you a dollar I can
touch you under your shirt

20:25.425 --> 20:27.594
without actually touching.
- Graham, quit it.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
- It's not funny, Graham.
It's never funny.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.097
You better stop,
or I'm going to tell Mom.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.765
- You are?

20:32.765 --> 20:34.601
You're going to tell Mom
that I did this?

20:34.601 --> 20:36.736
- Stop it!
Get your hands off me!

20:36.736 --> 20:38.805
- And so this was
three years ago?

20:38.805 --> 20:40.407
That would explain
why the piano teacher

20:40.407 --> 20:42.008
dropped out midway
through that season.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.410
So did Graham.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.777
- Yeah, that's what Pete
was telling us.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.245
He said the parents
knew about this.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.680
So did the town judge.
He sent Graham away.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.316
- Sent him away where?

20:49.316 --> 20:51.351
- Pete thinks it's called
Camp Righteous Path.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.252
It's some sort of
evangelical reform camp

20:53.252 --> 20:55.755
for bad boys up in Canada.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.156
- Also not in any episodes.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.858
- So did they tell Lane

20:58.858 --> 21:00.327
to say it was the cameraman,

21:00.327 --> 21:02.329
or did she come up
with that herself?

21:02.329 --> 21:04.997
- There's no way they're gonna
blame their own son.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.766
- Okay, Dodds and Rollins,

21:06.766 --> 21:09.101
tell the Bakers to stay close
in case Pete confesses.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.938
You two, take a drive
up to Allanville.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.177
- Graham is a fine young boy.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.212
That whole family
is the pride of Allanville.

21:20.212 --> 21:21.781
- Yeah, we understand
that he got in some trouble

21:21.781 --> 21:23.550
a few years back.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.618
You sentenced him to a reform
camp, Camp Righteous Path?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.920
- The camp tell you that?
Because they're mistaken.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.956
I did suggest that Graham
spend some time there,

21:29.956 --> 21:32.024
but that was in my capacity
as an elder of the church,

21:32.024 --> 21:33.560
not as a judge.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.227
- See, I told you.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.629
That's why there's
no legal record of this,

21:36.629 --> 21:38.598
right, Your Honor?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.132
- You checked on that too?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.469
- Either way,
why did you send him there?

21:42.469 --> 21:44.471
- Because as a boy
with too many sisters,

21:44.471 --> 21:46.138
he needed to be around
other young men.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.474
Let some steam off.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.476
- Did Graham have trouble
with his sisters?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.944
- No, of course not.
Have you seen their show?

21:51.944 --> 21:54.080
We all love that family.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.149
Oh, you'll have to excuse me.
Here's my foursome now.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.952
Pastor Eldon.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.855
- We know a Pastor Gregory
Eldon--any relation there?

22:02.855 --> 22:05.191
- Yeah, that would be his son.
Good man.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.728
The acorn
didn't fall far from that tree.

22:08.728 --> 22:12.399
- Okay, so the local judge plays
golf with Pastor Eldon Senior,

22:12.399 --> 22:13.866
and Pastor Eldon Junior

22:13.866 --> 22:15.468
just happens to be
the Bakers' lawyer?

22:15.468 --> 22:18.204
- I don't like golf.
I don't like small towns.

22:18.204 --> 22:20.673
And I really
don't like the Catskills.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.809
- Hey, Lieutenant.
Well, we went to the judge.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.411
We went to the local precinct.

22:24.411 --> 22:26.546
There's no paperwork,
no police reports.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.415
Nobody knows anything
about Graham,

22:28.415 --> 22:31.584
but they all knew
that we were up here.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.420
Okay, copy that.

22:33.420 --> 22:36.456
- What'd she say?
- To watch our backs.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.860
- Check this out.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.129
Driving while NYPD.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.848
- License and registration?

23:01.848 --> 23:03.783
- How you doing, officer?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.485
We're on the job.

23:05.485 --> 23:07.754
- Good for you.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.790
We take speeding
very seriously.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.025
- What do you say
we just get out of your town?

23:20.667 --> 23:22.669
- Seeing as
you're brother officers,

23:22.669 --> 23:26.973
I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

23:26.973 --> 23:30.543
While you're up here...
drive carefully.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.246
- What's that?

23:37.650 --> 23:40.820
- Well, at least one guy
up here is on to the Bakers.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.321
Graham's Juvie records.

23:42.321 --> 23:44.824
Three complaints
of forcible touching.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.893
One attempted assault
on a minor.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.961
A few speeding tickets.

23:48.961 --> 23:52.231
Ordered sealed by
the Honorable Elias J. Barnes.

24:02.542 --> 24:02.675
.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.244
- And as Peter teaches us,
"Keep a good conscience

24:07.279 --> 24:08.815
"so that in the thing
in which you are slandered,

24:08.815 --> 24:11.551
"those who revile
your good behavior in Christ

24:11.551 --> 24:13.319
will be put to shame."

24:13.319 --> 24:15.788
- Pastor Eldon.
Uh, sorry to interrupt,

24:15.788 --> 24:17.389
but we were wondering
if we could just get a moment

24:17.389 --> 24:19.926
with you
and Mr. and Mrs. Baker.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.628
- Of course.
Rick, could you lead the group?

24:21.628 --> 24:24.230
- Certainly, Pastor.
- Thank you.

24:24.230 --> 24:25.532
This way.

24:25.532 --> 24:30.537
- Can we move on to Chapter 4,
a living for God?

24:30.537 --> 24:32.905
"Therefore, since Christ
suffered in his body,

24:32.905 --> 24:35.441
"arm yourselves also
with the same attitude

24:35.441 --> 24:38.845
"because he who has suffered
in his body is done with sin.

24:38.845 --> 24:41.848
As a result, he does not live
the rest of his earthly life."

24:41.848 --> 24:43.683
- You're not charging
the cameraman?

24:43.683 --> 24:45.552
- No, we are.
Unlawful surveillance,

24:45.552 --> 24:48.320
possibly child pornography,
but not statutory rape.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.656
- Lane named him, though.
She wouldn't lie about that.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.257
- Well, she might,

24:51.257 --> 24:53.660
especially if she were
trying to protect someone.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.294
- What's going on here?

24:55.294 --> 24:58.965
- Well, you tell us,
Mrs. Baker, all right?

24:58.965 --> 25:03.035
We understand that your son,
Graham, has...

25:03.035 --> 25:05.271
had some problems?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.039
- He's a boy
going through puberty.

25:07.039 --> 25:08.608
There were some curiosities,
some bad choices,

25:08.608 --> 25:10.176
but nothing like this.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.711
- In that case,
it shouldn't be a problem

25:11.711 --> 25:14.413
if we talk to him just to,
you know, clear the air.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.583
- Oh, I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.217
Graham's en route to Ecuador.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.286
A mission down there's in need.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.622
- Wow, that was fast.
- Excuse me?

25:22.622 --> 25:24.456
- Did your father
or did Judge Barnes

25:24.456 --> 25:27.093
call you and tell you
to get Graham out of town?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.595
- You're making a lot
of assumption here.

25:28.595 --> 25:30.196
- Am I?

25:30.196 --> 25:31.931
- As the family's attorney,

25:31.931 --> 25:35.768
I'm gonna ask you
to leave our church.

25:35.768 --> 25:38.738
- Well, that's your right.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.643
But I need you to know,
Mrs. Baker,

25:43.643 --> 25:48.147
that these issues
don't just go away.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.349
Your daughter needs help.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.086
- Ecuador, huh?

25:54.086 --> 25:55.622
That's a smart move.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.456
I just read their
extradition treaty,

25:57.456 --> 25:59.258
and Swiss cheese
has less holes.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.661
- And Barba said we have to have
Graham dead to rights

26:01.661 --> 26:04.296
on the statutory charge
before we even try extradition.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.632
- He also said he has
no interest

26:05.632 --> 26:07.499
in compelling an amnio
or a blood test.

26:07.499 --> 26:08.968
- Translation:
even Barba knows

26:08.968 --> 26:10.536
it's political suicide
for a DA.

26:10.536 --> 26:12.071
- So we just wait six months

26:12.071 --> 26:13.840
until the baby's
born and prove it then.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.642
- Wait, we're gonna
stay on this for six months?

26:15.642 --> 26:17.043
Lane won't testify,

26:17.043 --> 26:18.645
and the family sent the doer
to Ecuador.

26:18.645 --> 26:22.649
- Guys, I don't want
to hear this, all right?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.884
This is not about
adolescent curiosity.

26:24.884 --> 26:26.886
He is a predator, right?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.988
If he did it once,
he's gonna do it again.

26:28.988 --> 26:31.490
- And he could have done
it before.

26:31.490 --> 26:34.393
Okay, I've been
binge watching the show.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.028
Desk duty. And anyway,

26:36.028 --> 26:38.530
they cover almost every moment
of each pregnancy,

26:38.530 --> 26:40.700
from the first trimester
all the way into labor,

26:40.700 --> 26:43.235
except for when Pam
is pregnant with Tate.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.671
- Which one is Tate?

26:44.671 --> 26:46.338
- He's the two-year-old.
The youngest.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.941
- And every kid is spaced out
two years apart or more,

26:48.941 --> 26:51.944
but Tate was born only 11 months
after his older brother Pier.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.213
- They could be Irish twins.
- Maybe.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.750
But Pam announced
four previous pregnancies

26:57.750 --> 27:00.252
by the third month, right?

27:00.252 --> 27:02.689
With Tate she waits
until she's seven months in.

27:02.689 --> 27:06.092
And this, look...
this was posted to their website

27:06.092 --> 27:08.127
just a few weeks
before that announcement.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.696
- That far along,
and she looks like that?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.363
Rollins, when you were
seven months you were like--

27:11.363 --> 27:13.432
- Carisi.
- Hold on.

27:13.432 --> 27:16.869
Graham got one
of his other sisters pregnant.

27:16.869 --> 27:18.705
Which one?

27:18.705 --> 27:21.473
- My guess is Summer.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.777
Three years ago she's 12,
he's 14,

27:24.777 --> 27:26.445
and in the season finale,

27:26.445 --> 27:29.148
Pam and Summer go to Michigan
to visit a sick aunt.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.517
I mean, they're only in, like,
one scene,

27:31.517 --> 27:33.385
and that's via Facetime.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.221
- Okay, we still
have the same issues.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.389
Graham is in Ecuador,
and the family won't help.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.358
- Except for one thing.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.995
We don't need an amnio
to get Tate's DNA or Graham's.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.164
- Again, the family
won't cooperate.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.733
We're going around in circles.
- Okay, Dodds.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.067
You made your point.

27:49.736 --> 27:53.172
- You know what,
cooperation isn't an issue here.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.075
Remember when the kids were here
and I had to play Uncle Sonny?

27:56.075 --> 27:57.376
Well, Tate got cold,
so I gave him my jacket.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.911
He drooled all over it.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.246
- You didn't take it
to the dry cleaner?

28:00.246 --> 28:01.480
- No,
I only wore it twice.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.884
- Okay.
So we got Tate's DNA.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.318
We still need Graham's.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.320
- What about Graham's father?
- Frank?

28:08.320 --> 28:10.556
He's in the ROTC.
We can get it.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.225
- If this was, indeed, incest,

28:13.225 --> 28:17.196
then Frank is the grandfather
on both sides.

28:27.606 --> 28:30.476
Dodds, you're still here.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.980
- Uh...[ahem]
Paperwork.

28:33.980 --> 28:36.148
Besides, my dad says
you should never leave your desk

28:36.148 --> 28:38.384
until your boss leaves his.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.588
Or...hers.

28:42.588 --> 28:43.923
- Ha.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.457
Well, I'm going home now.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.494
Walk me out?

28:56.268 --> 28:58.370
- I'm sorry
if I spoke out of turn.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.139
- It's okay.

29:00.139 --> 29:02.942
- No, if I have doubts
about the direction of the case,

29:02.942 --> 29:05.177
I shouldn't say anything
in front of the whole squad.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.512
- Look, Dodds,
there's two things

29:06.512 --> 29:08.247
that you need to know
about me.

29:08.247 --> 29:10.716
First, I like an open
and free exchange of ideas.

29:10.716 --> 29:12.351
- I picked up on that one.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.254
- And second,
I'm usually right.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.824
- Copy that, Lieutenant.

29:17.824 --> 29:19.358
- Hey, a word of advice?

29:19.358 --> 29:20.459
- Please.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.294
- You're off to a good start.

29:22.294 --> 29:24.063
You don't have to knock it
out of the park

29:24.063 --> 29:25.431
in your first few weeks,
you know?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.633
[elevator bell dings]
- Yeah.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.405
[knocking]

29:33.405 --> 29:36.408
- Dr. Chung,
you got something for us?

29:36.408 --> 29:38.577
- Detective Rollins,
congratulations.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.479
Can I get you a chair?
- No, I'm fine.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.581
You ran the DNA
from Carisi's coat?

29:42.581 --> 29:44.583
- Yes. I found
three different sets.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.254
Detective Carisi's, a female
relative of Detective Carisi--

29:48.254 --> 29:50.156
- Yeah, it's my new niece.
She drools a lot too.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.958
Kids drool, Rollins.
Get used to it.

29:51.958 --> 29:54.560
- Okay, and the third?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.063
- I found what I'm almost
certain is Frank Baker's DNA

29:57.063 --> 29:58.764
on the maternal side.

29:58.764 --> 30:01.834
- Okay, so one of his daughters
could be Tate's mother.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.569
- Quite possibly.
- All right.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.804
That takes care of maternal.
What about the paternal side?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.908
- Sorry, there's no trace
of his DNA on the Y chromosome.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.776
I know you thought
this was incest, but...

30:10.776 --> 30:14.346
- But Tate's father
is not related to Frank Baker.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.615
Did you get any hits
on the DNA that you did find?

30:16.615 --> 30:18.450
- None.
For now, all I can say

30:18.450 --> 30:21.753
is the father's Caucasian
of Northern European descent.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.422
R.M.N.E.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.124
- Random man not excluded.
Great.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.792
So we're back to
square one, huh?

30:26.792 --> 30:29.028
Hey, Rollins.

30:29.028 --> 30:31.097
Hey, you okay?
- Ah...

30:31.097 --> 30:33.465
I...I don't know.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.534
Something's not right.

30:35.534 --> 30:39.338
[whimpering]
- Okay, okay, I got you.

30:45.878 --> 30:46.012
.

30:52.184 --> 30:52.684
- Why are you still here?

30:53.953 --> 30:55.487
- What do you think?

30:55.487 --> 30:57.323
This is your second ER visit
in two weeks.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.058
Rollins,
you got to slow it down.

30:59.058 --> 31:02.294
- I'm fine.
It was some back pain.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.731
Doctors say it could be
one of a hundred things.

31:05.731 --> 31:09.068
- But the baby's okay, right?
- Yeah.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.970
They're gonna run
some tests, though.

31:10.970 --> 31:13.239
- So they want you to stay.

31:13.239 --> 31:14.473
- Yeah.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.078
They want me on bed rest
afterwards.

31:19.078 --> 31:21.613
- Okay.
Better safe than sorry.

31:21.613 --> 31:24.450
- What am I gonna tell Liv?

31:24.450 --> 31:28.087
I mean, I told her that nothing
was gonna change and then--

31:28.087 --> 31:30.189
- She knew that wasn't true.
Come on.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.592
- What am I doing?

31:35.427 --> 31:37.029
[laughs]

31:37.029 --> 31:39.966
What was I thinking?
Having a baby on my own?

31:39.966 --> 31:43.235
- Amanda, hey, listen to me.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.337
I've been working with you
over a year now,

31:45.337 --> 31:47.806
and there is nothing
that you can't handle.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.246
- I screwed up.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.248
I won't be able to do this.

31:56.248 --> 32:00.452
- Hey, yeah, yeah, you will.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.822
It'll be okay.

32:03.822 --> 32:05.591
You know how I know that?

32:05.591 --> 32:06.892
'Cause my mother's at church

32:06.892 --> 32:09.361
lighting a candle
for you right now.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.701
- Okay, Carisi.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.169
Yeah, thanks.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.737
But stay up there, okay?

32:18.737 --> 32:20.339
Okay.

32:20.339 --> 32:21.707
- How's Rollins?

32:21.707 --> 32:24.010
- She's okay.
The baby's okay.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.912
But they want to keep her
there for observation.

32:26.912 --> 32:29.548
So where are we?

32:29.548 --> 32:32.218
- Well, it turns out Graham
isn't Tate's father.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.453
No Baker DNA
on the paternal side.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.455
- So why'd they
send him to Ecuador?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.390
- He may not be the father
of Summer's baby,

32:38.390 --> 32:40.426
but we can't rule him out
on Lane.

32:41.860 --> 32:43.295
- Okay, so we're thinking

32:43.295 --> 32:45.931
there are two separate predators
in her circle?

32:45.931 --> 32:49.235
Look,
it's a pretty closed community.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.869
I mean, you've got the family,

32:50.869 --> 32:52.404
you've got the crew,

32:52.404 --> 32:55.207
you've got--
you've got that pastor.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.244
- Damn it.
Pastor Eldon.

32:58.244 --> 32:59.878
He was on that East Harlem
mission trip in July

32:59.878 --> 33:01.313
with Lane, right?

33:01.313 --> 33:02.814
- I think so.
- Is there any chance

33:02.814 --> 33:04.116
we could put him with Summer
three years ago?

33:04.116 --> 33:05.451
- Let me check.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.153
- Remember I told you
about Crown Heights?

33:07.153 --> 33:08.954
One of the cases
involved three pregnant girls

33:08.954 --> 33:10.356
in the same synagogue.

33:10.356 --> 33:11.390
Well, now, we always
thought it was the Rabbi,

33:11.390 --> 33:12.824
but we couldn't make the case.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.893
No one was willing to say
a bad word about him.

33:14.893 --> 33:16.462
- Well, no one in this family's
gonna say a bad word

33:16.462 --> 33:19.065
about that pastor.
- Whoa.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.133
I got something
on their blog.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.703
Pastor Eldon and Summer,
2012.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.672
Christmas giving out gifts.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.307
- At the East Harlem Mission.

33:28.307 --> 33:30.076
He gets them away from home.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.078
That's his MO.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.113
I'll call Barba.

33:38.650 --> 33:40.152
- On the advice of counsel,

33:40.152 --> 33:42.154
the Bakers won't be
speaking to you anymore.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.323
They've gone back upstate.
- That's okay, Pastor.

33:44.323 --> 33:46.525
We want you.
- Oh?

33:46.525 --> 33:48.827
- In July, when Lane
was on her mission trip,

33:48.827 --> 33:50.262
you were with her?

33:50.262 --> 33:52.998
- I was.
- Did you spend time alone?

33:52.998 --> 33:54.700
- [chuckles]

33:54.700 --> 33:56.535
So that's
where you're going with this.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.570
- Any reason why we shouldn't?

33:58.570 --> 34:01.240
- Respect.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.975
Basic human decency.
Now, that's not to say

34:03.975 --> 34:05.677
I don't understand
where you're coming from.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.513
People like the Bakers and me,
we, uh...

34:07.513 --> 34:12.484
scare you with the values
that we espouse, our faith.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.920
You live in Gomorrah.

34:14.920 --> 34:18.157
When men of God come here and
preach love for the scripture,

34:18.157 --> 34:20.192
it threatens you people
to the core.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.661
- You think this is
religious persecution?

34:22.661 --> 34:24.530
- Well, you said it, not me.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.298
But I have seen it before.

34:26.298 --> 34:27.933
Oh, yeah,
every time I leave New York,

34:27.933 --> 34:32.371
I think, "Just keep going.
Don't look back."

34:32.371 --> 34:34.005
But...

34:34.005 --> 34:36.842
there's too much work
to be done.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.944
Too many souls to minister to.

34:38.944 --> 34:41.680
- Like you ministered
to Lane?

34:41.680 --> 34:43.449
- Okay, I've had enough of this.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.051
- Not quite.
- We're gonna need a DNA sample.

34:46.051 --> 34:47.886
- Since you didn't
do the deed,

34:47.886 --> 34:49.521
you won't have any problem
giving us one.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.857
- Well, I believe
you need a warrant for that.

34:51.857 --> 34:53.892
- "Ask and ye shall receive."

34:53.892 --> 34:55.761
- Open up.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.997
- How's Detective Rollins
doing?

34:58.997 --> 35:00.799
- She's home, but they want
to keep her on bed rest for now,

35:00.799 --> 35:02.868
and we are racing
against the clock.

35:02.868 --> 35:05.237
- It's a computer program.
I can't make it go any faster.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.005
- Whatever you can do.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.743
- Okay, we got it.

35:11.743 --> 35:13.545
We're looking
at a paternal match.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.515
- You sure?
- I would testify, yes.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.253
- We're looking
for Pastor Eldon.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.054
- Oh, Pastor Eldon.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.291
I'm sorry,
he left early this morning.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.792
- Any idea where?

35:29.295 --> 35:30.896
- Pastor Eldon,

35:30.896 --> 35:34.466
I will love, honor,
and obey you,

35:34.466 --> 35:36.635
till death do us part.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.277
- Lane, I will love you
and be faithful--

35:45.277 --> 35:46.512
- Hang on.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.214
- What's going on?

35:48.214 --> 35:50.582
- We have some questions
for the pastor.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.851
- Doug? Son, what do you think
you're doing here?

35:52.851 --> 35:54.653
- I'm sorry, Judge Barnes.
They said--

35:54.653 --> 35:56.222
- We have criminal evidence
against Pastor Eldon.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.623
- Well, it will have to wait.

35:57.623 --> 36:00.226
Lane and I are getting married.

36:00.226 --> 36:03.329
- Married?
She's 13.

36:03.329 --> 36:05.697
- She turned 14 today.
It's perfectly legal.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.867
I have the approval of Judge
Barnes and both of her parents.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.869
- Pastor Eldon has stepped
forward to help us.

36:10.869 --> 36:13.905
- He's willing to provide
for Lane and her baby.

36:25.284 --> 36:25.417
.

36:26.985 --> 36:27.753
- You gave consent
for this marriage?

36:29.321 --> 36:30.756
- Yes, of course she did.

36:30.756 --> 36:32.157
- As did I.

36:32.157 --> 36:33.359
- We're protecting
our daughter.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.294
Lane is just a girl.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.762
It'll be in name only.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.129
He'll be like a father to her.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.698
- Is that what the Pastor
told you?

36:39.698 --> 36:41.367
- Okay, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.701
This is a private ceremony.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.035
- In a public place.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.804
- Is someone going to
fill me in?

36:45.804 --> 36:47.706
- You can continue
with the ceremony, Elias.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.675
- We are handling this,
officers.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.443
Graham will get the help
he needs,

36:51.443 --> 36:54.446
and Pastor Eldon
will give Lane's baby a name.

36:54.446 --> 36:56.282
- And that's fitting,
since he's the father.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.116
Pretty good, Pastor, huh?

36:58.116 --> 37:00.118
You figured you married Lane,
it would be pretty hard

37:00.118 --> 37:02.721
for us to prosecute you
for statutory rape.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.556
- Judge?
- Lane, come with me.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.294
- It's legal.
She's legal.

37:08.294 --> 37:09.961
You have
no standing here.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.563
- Wait,
what are you talking about?

37:11.563 --> 37:14.300
- No doubt that your son
Graham has problems,

37:14.300 --> 37:17.469
but he is not the father
of Lane's baby or Summer's baby.

37:17.469 --> 37:18.870
- No, no,
Summer never had a baby.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.739
- Mrs. Baker, please.

37:20.739 --> 37:24.142
You're still maintaining
that you're Tate's mother?

37:24.142 --> 37:26.545
We tested his DNA.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.314
There is no Baker
paternal match.

37:28.314 --> 37:30.882
So you either cheated
on your husband--

37:30.882 --> 37:32.418
- Excuse me?
- Or--

37:32.418 --> 37:34.386
- I would never.
- Okay, I would advise you both

37:34.386 --> 37:35.921
to stop talking here.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.723
If you did obtain Tate's DNA,

37:37.723 --> 37:38.990
it was without consent
or a warrant.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.492
It's inadmissible.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.328
- Hey,
you know what's a bad sign?

37:42.328 --> 37:45.397
You making a legal argument
right now.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.998
- I don't understand
what's going on.

37:46.998 --> 37:48.600
- Judge, have Officer Tramwell

37:48.600 --> 37:50.502
remove these people
from the building.

37:50.502 --> 37:53.104
They have no jurisdiction.
- Another legal argument.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.174
All right, but before I go,
I think I have to tell you

37:56.174 --> 37:58.910
that we did test
the Pastor's DNA legally.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.846
- He is Tate's
biological father,

38:00.846 --> 38:02.414
and we believe that he is

38:02.414 --> 38:05.250
the biological father
of Lane's baby.

38:06.652 --> 38:09.388
- No, no, that can't be.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.690
- Pam, Frank, look,
they are lying to you.

38:11.690 --> 38:13.659
- DNA doesn't lie,
Pastor.

38:13.659 --> 38:16.362
- Frank, you told me
Graham confessed.

38:16.362 --> 38:18.029
- I did, just not to me.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.766
- Did Pastor Eldon tell you
that Graham confessed?

38:20.766 --> 38:22.934
You tried to pin this
on the boy?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.870
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.606
- No, no, no, look, that is not
what's happening here.

38:27.606 --> 38:29.375
Okay, look, you two know me
and you trust me.

38:29.375 --> 38:32.177
- Summer and Lane?

38:32.177 --> 38:36.014
Lane, sweetheart,
tell me the truth.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.616
Whatever it is, it's okay.

38:37.616 --> 38:39.918
- He loves me.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.520
It's God's plan for us.

38:41.520 --> 38:44.022
- What did you do
to my daughter?

38:44.022 --> 38:47.393
- I'm marrying her, Pam.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.728
I'm--I'm marrying--
We're gonna be husband and wife.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.196
A Godly marriage.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.399
The baby will be born
in wedlock--

38:53.399 --> 38:55.801
- She is just a child!
And Summer--

38:55.801 --> 38:56.868
- Frank, get ahold
of your wife here, please.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.036
- Pam.
- No.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.471
- You do not say no
to him.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.106
He is your husband.
Your patriarch.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.941
- You lied to us.

39:02.941 --> 39:06.845
You made us think
it was our son. Why?

39:06.845 --> 39:11.583
- Because he knew that you would
do anything to protect Graham.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.987
- I'll testify.

39:15.987 --> 39:18.023
About Tate.
About everything.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.791
- Gregory.
- No, no, no.

39:19.791 --> 39:22.428
Look, look, they have no case.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.896
They told the whole world
that Tate was their baby.

39:24.896 --> 39:28.534
They don't want their fans
to find out that they lied.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.669
And Lane, well, Lane, you--

39:30.669 --> 39:32.438
- You need to stop
talking to her.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.308
- Honey, sweetheart, Lane,
I'm so sorry.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.344
I didn't know.

39:39.344 --> 39:41.880
I should have protected you.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.649
- I'm sorry, Mama.

39:43.649 --> 39:47.018
He told me that's
what people in love do.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.261
- She'll tell the truth.

39:56.261 --> 39:58.096
And so will Summer.

39:58.096 --> 40:00.131
And so will I.

40:01.933 --> 40:06.237
I don't care about the damn show
and neither does Frank.

40:06.237 --> 40:08.874
We want him put away.

40:11.443 --> 40:12.911
- Now?
- Yep.

40:12.911 --> 40:15.046
- Pastor Eldon,
you are under arrest

40:15.046 --> 40:17.382
for the statutory rape
of Summer Baker.

40:17.382 --> 40:19.751
- And for the statutory rape
of Lane Baker.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.419
- You have the right
to remain silent.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.054
Anything you say--
- I know my rights.

40:23.054 --> 40:25.256
None of this will hold up
in court.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.358
I love you, Lane.

40:27.358 --> 40:30.228
- [stifled sobbing]

40:30.228 --> 40:33.131
- You really are
a piece of crap.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.441
- We're grateful for
the prayers and kindness

40:43.441 --> 40:45.577
we received
during this difficult time.

40:45.577 --> 40:48.947
As parents, we're devastated
by the actions of Pastor Eldon

40:48.947 --> 40:52.117
and the pain he's inflicted
on our daughters.

40:52.117 --> 40:53.485
He willfully used
the Lord's name

40:53.485 --> 40:55.654
to manipulate our children.

40:55.654 --> 40:58.790
He violated the tenets
of our beliefs.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.992
It's a long journey
towards healing for all of us,

41:00.992 --> 41:03.829
but our main concern
is our girls.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.532
And as always, our faith
in God will sustain us,

41:06.532 --> 41:09.367
and them,
through this difficult time.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.672
- Well, Barba told me
that Pastor Eldon

41:13.672 --> 41:16.742
will plead to multiple counts
of statutory rape,

41:16.742 --> 41:19.210
so he's looking at hard time.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.813
- Another son of a bitch
hiding behind the collar.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.015
You know, the priest
at my church, growing up,

41:24.015 --> 41:25.851
he saved my life.
He saved my life.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.653
But you only ever hear
about the bad ones.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.922
- So, Dodds, you still
think this was a waste of time?

41:30.922 --> 41:32.991
- No, I get it.

41:32.991 --> 41:36.562
I just thought SVU would be
taking rapists off the streets,

41:36.562 --> 41:39.831
not out of the churches.

41:39.831 --> 41:42.000
- Well, for what it's worth,
Dodds,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.571
most rapists
don't hunt on the streets.

41:45.571 --> 41:48.607
They hunt
where they're trusted.
