- lnput failure.
- lnput failure.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.428
lnput failure.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.173
Our link to the collective
has been severed.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.037
lnitiate secondary protocols.

00:45.812 --> 00:47.279
The vessel's transwarp chamber

00:47.347 --> 00:48.974
is approaching
critical pressure.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.641
We must evacuate this area.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.014
Agreed.

00:52.085 --> 00:53.017
No directional...

00:53.086 --> 00:54.280
coordinates are available.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.321
...coordinates
are available.

00:56.689 --> 00:57.986
That way.

00:58.058 --> 00:58.990
Bearing 301.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.026
Agreed.

01:01.027 --> 01:02.494
Bring that drone.

03:00.446 --> 03:04.007
Captain's Log, Stardate 53049.2.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.017
We've docked
at the Markonian Outpost

03:06.085 --> 03:07.643
and agreed to mutual visits,

03:07.720 --> 03:10.416
so l'm allowing shore leave
to anyone who wants it.

03:10.490 --> 03:14.017
Commander Tuvok has objected
to taking on too many visitors.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.355
But, security issues aside,

03:15.428 --> 03:17.555
l'm looking forward
to a cultural exchange

03:17.630 --> 03:19.188
and making some new friends.

03:24.003 --> 03:25.061
Pardon me.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.229
Excuse me.

03:26.339 --> 03:27.636
Careful, careful.

03:27.707 --> 03:28.969
Excuse me.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.643
Watch it!

03:32.712 --> 03:34.145
Excuse me.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.306
Captain?

03:37.383 --> 03:39.078
l'll be right with you.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.322
The station manager didn't tell
me the vines were prehensile.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.189
l went to put some water
in the pot and it grabbed me.

03:48.261 --> 03:50.456
This is a gift
from the Kinbori Delegation.

03:50.530 --> 03:51.588
l don't know its name,

03:51.664 --> 03:54.155
only that it's used
in one of their sacred games

03:54.267 --> 03:55.256
and it's very heavy.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.097
Well, put it down anywhere.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.101
Thank the Kinbori for me,

04:04.177 --> 04:07.271
and give them
a token of our esteem.

04:07.347 --> 04:10.009
l already gave them
a Voyager medallion.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.778
They seemed appreciative.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.284
Come in.

04:16.522 --> 04:17.784
Doesn't it look like

04:17.857 --> 04:20.120
Christmas morning
in here, Commander?

04:20.192 --> 04:21.750
You have to admit the generosity

04:21.827 --> 04:23.420
of our guests is
very impressive.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.760
As is their proclivity
for criminal behavior.

04:25.832 --> 04:27.356
This morning's security report.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.025
Broken ODN line...

04:29.135 --> 04:31.035
some missing personal items...

04:31.104 --> 04:32.696
a damaged scanner relay.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.363
All in all, not that bad.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.533
There is a second page
to the report.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.578
Well, some
of these incidents

04:39.646 --> 04:41.477
are a little more serious.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.744
But on balance, l still think
we did the right thing.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.648
There is a third page.

04:46.719 --> 04:51.247
Come on, Tuvok, after all the
xenophobic races we've run into

04:51.324 --> 04:53.155
don't you find it
just a little refreshing

04:53.226 --> 04:55.956
to meet some people
who value openness and freedom?

04:56.062 --> 04:57.290
Well, as far as l'm concerned,

04:57.363 --> 04:59.558
opening the ship has been
a fascinating experience

04:59.632 --> 05:00.894
and an unqualified success.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.967
l'm very pleased.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.059
Me, too.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.694
l am pleased
that you are pleased.

05:05.805 --> 05:06.999
lf you'll excuse me.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.038
Tuvok...

05:08.107 --> 05:10.075
please accept this
token of our esteem.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.537
Oh, no.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.514
lt's got me by the hair.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.879
Now it's 12:45.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.081
lf you're hungry,
you may eat without me.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.388
You said we'd have
lunch together.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.825
l haven't completed
my analysis

05:28.895 --> 05:30.795
of the station's power
conversion matrix.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.728
How long is it gonna take?

05:32.799 --> 05:33.891
Several hours.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.025
Seven, you promised.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.164
Very well.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.650
l think it's even more crowded
than this morning.

05:52.719 --> 05:53.947
Yes.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.180
Excuse us. Excuse us.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.883
Please, we're trying to get
through to the turbolift.

05:58.958 --> 06:00.687
Excuse us.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.489
Stand aside!

06:05.665 --> 06:06.927
Thank you.

06:11.671 --> 06:15.232
l'm sorry, but there's
no more Marsupial Surprise.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.572
We only had two kilos
of pouches to begin with

06:18.644 --> 06:19.872
and it's all gone!

06:20.012 --> 06:21.843
Now, how about some pizza, huh?

06:21.914 --> 06:25.816
She's... a Shivolian, right?

06:25.885 --> 06:26.874
Correct.

06:27.019 --> 06:29.078
Species 521?

06:29.155 --> 06:30.986
Your mother
would not approve of you

06:31.057 --> 06:32.581
memorizing Borg designations.

06:32.658 --> 06:33.590
l don't approve either.

06:33.659 --> 06:34.887
We've discussed
the impropriety

06:35.027 --> 06:37.393
of you emulating the Borg.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.760
Sorry.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.394
l'm finished.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.833
We just sat down.

06:43.936 --> 06:47.201
l do not enjoy crowds.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.501
But you were in the collective.

06:48.574 --> 06:49.768
Wasn't that like a big crowd?

06:49.842 --> 06:53.334
Which is why
l do not enjoy them now.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.381
Oh. l'm sorry.
l didn't realize that.

06:55.448 --> 06:56.380
Let's go.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.416
Excuse me.

06:59.218 --> 07:00.810
Are you Seven of Nine?

07:00.887 --> 07:02.411
Yes.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.339
You okay?

07:25.411 --> 07:27.811
These are Borg synaptic relays

07:27.880 --> 07:30.041
from my original unimatrix.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.981
These are yours?

07:32.051 --> 07:33.484
Where did you acquire them?

07:33.553 --> 07:37.353
A trader from Orendal V.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.857
l was told
you are a former Borg drone

07:39.926 --> 07:42.360
and might be interested
in acquiring these pieces.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.896
l'll take them.

07:44.997 --> 07:46.396
Captain Janeway will provide you

07:46.466 --> 07:48.627
with whatever monetary
reimbursement you require.

07:48.701 --> 07:50.669
Agreed.

07:51.838 --> 07:55.103
l must examine these items
more closely.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.141
Okay.

07:57.677 --> 07:58.905
What's your name?

08:02.081 --> 08:03.946
That was rude.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.785
Stage two is complete.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.188
She has the relays.

08:12.258 --> 08:13.418
She's going to study them.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.621
Her regeneration alcove
is in Cargo Bay 2.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.061
That's where she'll go.

08:18.130 --> 08:20.223
We should prepare
for stage three.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.664
Agreed.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.826
There's consensus.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.938
Rendezvous at my coordinates

08:26.038 --> 08:28.632
and stand by
to penetrate their security.

08:44.155 --> 08:45.885
Error.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.425
Explain.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.191
We shouldn't be desecrating
the body of this drone.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.790
lt is against the will
of Brothara.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.459
Who is Brothara?

08:56.569 --> 09:00.528
Brothara: a supernatural
deity worshipped

09:00.640 --> 09:02.164
by Species 57 1.

09:04.110 --> 09:06.578
l am a member of Species 57 1.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.806
You're being confused
by irrelevant data.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.041
lgnore it.

09:10.116 --> 09:13.108
You said, ''l am
a member of Species 57 1.''

09:13.185 --> 09:15.278
Do you consider yourself
an individual?

09:17.456 --> 09:18.923
There are no individuals here.

09:18.991 --> 09:19.923
We are Borg.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.324
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.657
Agreed.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.289
Resume constructing
the communications beacon.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.810
lt looks like
a standard Borg synaptic relay.

09:46.886 --> 09:49.787
There must be something more.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.085
When l first came
into contact with it,

09:52.158 --> 09:55.025
l was overwhelmed
with images, memories, sounds.

09:55.094 --> 09:58.495
Sounds like a perfectly natural
reaction to me.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.465
That was part
your old unimatrix, right?

10:01.534 --> 10:03.525
Well, isn't it
at least possible

10:03.603 --> 10:06.572
that what you experienced
was simply nostalgia?

10:06.672 --> 10:08.640
You know, sentimental
feelings about the past.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.699
l know what nostalgia is,

10:10.810 --> 10:13.210
but l have no feelings
about the past.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.211
Okay.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.273
l think l've done
all l can here.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.476
Lieutenant...

10:22.588 --> 10:26.354
you were trying to help.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.949
l appreciate that.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.426
Anytime.

10:30.496 --> 10:35.195
Oh, and, um, you may not
be nostalgic about the past,

10:35.301 --> 10:38.964
but l'd say you definitely
have feelings about it.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.366
Strong ones.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.610
Their security protocols
are formidable.

10:52.685 --> 10:54.118
We may not have enough time.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.586
l'm worried
about Seven of Nine.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.021
We should reexamine

10:58.090 --> 10:59.557
the question
of simply asking...

10:59.625 --> 11:00.956
You know what her
reactions will be.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.185
She won't help us
because she...

11:02.261 --> 11:03.728
We've been through all that.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.788
She could be
permanently injured.

11:06.866 --> 11:08.663
l don't want to harm...

11:08.768 --> 11:09.735
Enough!

11:12.471 --> 11:15.304
We need consensus.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.244
We can't act without it.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.774
l know.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.944
So, then it's up to you.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.580
Do we proceed or not?

11:32.291 --> 11:33.622
Yes.

11:36.295 --> 11:40.095
We... l apologize
for my indecision.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.157
Apologies are irrelevant!

11:47.039 --> 11:49.507
Computer, begin
multipolar analysis.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.235
Analysis underway.

11:51.310 --> 11:52.834
Time to completion?

11:52.912 --> 11:54.880
Five hours, 17 minutes.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.162
She's regenerating.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.199
Begin rerouting
their internal sensors.

12:14.266 --> 12:18.168
Rerouting sensor input
to secondary processors.

12:45.631 --> 12:46.620
Hold.

12:49.468 --> 12:51.163
What have you got?

12:51.270 --> 12:54.239
There's a power fluctuation
in the security grid.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.158
All we know is that we've
got a security breach.

13:14.226 --> 13:15.250
We don't know where.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.202
Ready.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.271
lnsert the interlink module.

13:31.443 --> 13:32.603
Ready.

13:37.716 --> 13:40.014
He's still worried
about injuring her.

13:45.925 --> 13:49.053
lf we fail, we'll never
become individuals.

13:49.128 --> 13:50.959
We have to remember that.

13:55.801 --> 13:57.359
There is consensus.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.044
l've found her memory files.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.742
She's aware of our presence.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.877
She's trying
to regain consciousness.

14:14.954 --> 14:15.886
We must abort.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.955
No! We're too close.

14:20.626 --> 14:23.094
l will not comply.

14:58.197 --> 15:02.600
l have performed
this action before.

15:02.668 --> 15:05.228
l was with my father.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.464
He was a tall man.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.736
l have a... similar memory.

15:10.809 --> 15:12.970
But l was in a house

15:13.045 --> 15:15.536
and the fire was in a hearth.

15:15.614 --> 15:17.912
The biomatter is ready.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.995
lt tastes similar
to a bird l once ate.

15:33.065 --> 15:34.896
l used to prepare food...

15:35.067 --> 15:36.898
for...

15:37.069 --> 15:38.502
my parents.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.801
They lived...
in a small building

15:41.874 --> 15:43.705
by...

15:43.776 --> 15:46.210
a river.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.836
l used to be...

15:47.913 --> 15:50.279
afraid of the dark.

15:50.349 --> 15:52.544
Just before l was assimilated,
l was...

15:52.618 --> 15:56.952
eating with a group of men.

15:57.089 --> 16:01.458
We... worked in numbers.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.619
Mathematics.

16:02.695 --> 16:06.256
l... calculated equations
for another man.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.232
l have a name.

16:09.435 --> 16:10.993
lt's...

16:11.103 --> 16:12.570
Marika.

16:16.308 --> 16:21.507
Marika Willkarah.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.775
Willkarah.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.545
Hello, Marika Willkarah.

16:27.953 --> 16:29.887
Her designation
is Three of Nine.

16:30.022 --> 16:31.887
l have a name.

16:32.024 --> 16:34.993
P'Chan.

16:35.060 --> 16:38.188
Son of Dornar and Ansha.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.426
My primary function
was to care for them.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.558
l was married.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.637
We were on a starship...

16:45.738 --> 16:47.228
the Excalibur.

16:47.339 --> 16:51.036
l worked in Engineering.

16:51.110 --> 16:53.738
This is not my hand.

16:53.812 --> 16:56.406
My parents... they're dead.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.609
The Borg killed them.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.646
l hate the Borg.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.248
This is counterproductive.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.817
We must delete
all irrelevant data.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.691
l want my hand back.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.026
l was on duty...

17:13.098 --> 17:14.531
the night watch...

17:14.599 --> 17:17.501
when the Borg came....

17:17.603 --> 17:19.627
Oh, my God!

17:19.738 --> 17:23.435
Look at what they've...
done to me!

17:23.509 --> 17:25.977
These- these things
they put in my body!

17:26.078 --> 17:27.045
What have they done?

17:27.112 --> 17:28.977
Command override.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.242
Cease this interaction!

17:32.584 --> 17:34.051
Comply.

17:34.119 --> 17:37.885
We will not access
these memory files again.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.287
lnitiate the prescribed

17:39.358 --> 17:42.191
maintenance and survival
protocols only.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.491
No further communication
is required,

17:44.563 --> 17:47.532
until we are reassimilated
into the collective.

17:47.599 --> 17:52.935
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.903
Agreed.

18:01.580 --> 18:04.708
...but whoever removed their
implants was a poor surgeon.

18:04.783 --> 18:07.217
Their internal organs were
damaged during the procedure

18:07.286 --> 18:09.481
and their bodies are
covered with scars.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.386
You said you recognized them.

18:11.457 --> 18:12.754
Not at first.

18:12.825 --> 18:15.316
But when they attempted
to access my memory files,

18:15.394 --> 18:17.191
l was momentarily linked
with them.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.354
Two of Nine.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.455
Three of Nine.

18:20.532 --> 18:21.760
Four of Nine.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.428
We were all members
of the same unimatrix.

18:24.536 --> 18:27.061
Do you know why they were trying
to access your memories?

18:27.172 --> 18:28.434
No.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.407
How long have they
been disconnected

18:30.476 --> 18:31.568
from the collective?

18:31.643 --> 18:32.701
Three or four months.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.372
However, they are still
connected to each other.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.075
Somehow, the left parietal
lobes of their brains

18:38.150 --> 18:41.142
have been transformed
into organic interlink nodes.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.279
They've become
linked together

18:43.355 --> 18:45.789
into a sort of collective triad.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.257
Revive them.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.697
l'm Captain Janeway.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.599
We know who you are,

18:58.704 --> 19:00.831
and we know
what you were trying to do.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.530
What we don't know is why.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.108
She has information
we need.

19:04.209 --> 19:05.574
What kind of information?

19:05.644 --> 19:06.975
We want to become...

19:07.045 --> 19:08.535
lndividuals.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.809
You want to break
the neural link

19:10.883 --> 19:12.612
between the three of you?

19:12.684 --> 19:13.776
Wouldn't you?

19:13.852 --> 19:14.944
None of us is alone

19:15.020 --> 19:17.045
with our own thoughts,
our own feelings.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.487
Every day of my life is spent

19:18.557 --> 19:20.525
hearing their two voices
in my head.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.684
When we're asleep,

19:21.760 --> 19:23.352
we experience
each other's dreams.

19:23.428 --> 19:25.794
How's that different
from life in the collective?

19:25.864 --> 19:28.128
ln the collective, there
are billions of voices.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.667
They become... white noise.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.465
But with only three...

19:32.571 --> 19:34.732
Each voice comes through
clearly.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.364
lt has to stop.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.239
We must break the neural link.

19:39.311 --> 19:41.575
Doctor, is there anything
you can do?

19:41.647 --> 19:43.877
The modifications
are too extensive.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.042
Their neuronal pathways
have been fundamentally altered.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.313
You hold the key.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.082
Why?

19:50.155 --> 19:51.713
You were there with us.

19:51.790 --> 19:54.190
Planet 1865 Alpha.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.556
You must remember.

19:57.729 --> 20:00.755
Eight years ago,
our vessel crashed.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.096
The four of us were
the only survivors.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.760
When we were reassimilated...

20:04.870 --> 20:07.338
We found we'd been linked
together somehow.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.636
We were a subset
within the collective.

20:09.708 --> 20:12.438
lt's like having three voices
whispering in one ear...

20:12.511 --> 20:14.570
And a crowd screaming
in the other.

20:14.646 --> 20:17.410
We had to break free,
so we worked together,

20:17.482 --> 20:18.915
and we finally escaped.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.475
We had our implants removed
on lnavar Prime...

20:21.553 --> 20:23.384
But they couldn't break
the neural link.

20:23.455 --> 20:24.945
We need to find out

20:25.023 --> 20:26.752
what happened eight years ago

20:26.825 --> 20:28.156
after the crash...

20:28.227 --> 20:31.788
The night we were reassimilated
into the collective.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.957
We need to know how
the link was created.

20:35.100 --> 20:36.965
But our memories are...

20:37.069 --> 20:39.629
Fragmented, disorganized.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.935
We hoped that you would know.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.169
l don't.

20:45.244 --> 20:49.613
However, l am willing to attempt
to retrieve the data.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.110
Come with me.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.653
Are you ready?

21:04.563 --> 21:05.530
Yes.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.497
Data search complete.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.763
Do you remember
anything further?

21:13.872 --> 21:15.066
No.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.470
My last memory is of us...

21:18.543 --> 21:19.874
ls of us standing around...

21:19.945 --> 21:20.877
Around a campfire.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.072
And yet the data files

21:22.147 --> 21:25.173
in your cortical processor
appear to be intact.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.774
l see no evidence
that would explain

21:26.852 --> 21:28.342
your lapse in memory.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.614
What about you?

21:29.688 --> 21:32.418
Why don't you remember
what happened?

21:32.491 --> 21:33.423
l don't know.

21:33.492 --> 21:34.959
l've found no evidence

21:35.093 --> 21:37.618
of damage
to my memory files either.

21:37.696 --> 21:39.288
l remember the campfire

21:39.364 --> 21:41.958
and then waking up
in the collective.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.898
There is an obvious gap...

21:44.002 --> 21:45.731
but no indication of why.

21:45.837 --> 21:48.237
Why do they still
call you Seven?

21:48.307 --> 21:50.138
You should have a name.

21:50.208 --> 21:51.140
lt is my name.

21:51.209 --> 21:52.141
No.

21:52.210 --> 21:55.202
lt's a designation.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.145
You're an individual now.

21:58.383 --> 22:02.479
l decided that my former name
was no longer appropriate.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.887
Prepare to reinitialize
the memory cascade.

22:06.024 --> 22:08.424
l can't wait to use
my real name again.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.519
There is nothing
preventing you from doing so.

22:11.596 --> 22:13.496
Except that, most of the time,

22:13.565 --> 22:18.161
l don't know whether my name
is Marika, P'Chan or Lansor.

22:18.270 --> 22:19.601
The names, the memories...

22:19.671 --> 22:22.799
The memories, even the thoughts
flow from one to the other.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.535
l can't love or hate or laugh...

22:24.609 --> 22:26.338
- Or cry without...
- or cry without...

22:26.411 --> 22:28.538
- sharing it with them.
- sharing it with them.

22:28.613 --> 22:31.673
How can any of us take
a name for ourselves...

22:31.750 --> 22:32.944
For ourselves?

22:33.018 --> 22:34.849
We're not individuals.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.217
We're not Borg.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.915
We're nothing.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.692
Begin the memory cascade.

22:54.873 --> 22:56.431
''A friendly game''?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.668
Well... that's how it started.

22:58.744 --> 23:01.679
l see. And perhaps you
could explain to me

23:01.780 --> 23:04.840
how this friendly game
turned into a street brawl?

23:04.883 --> 23:08.080
Well, Harry and l
wanted to explore the station.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.643
Um... we wanted to broaden

23:09.721 --> 23:12.485
our understanding
of alien cultures and, uh...

23:12.557 --> 23:14.081
Skip the recruiting speech.

23:14.159 --> 23:15.558
You were looking for a bar.

23:15.627 --> 23:16.753
Then what?

23:16.828 --> 23:17.886
Well, we found one

23:17.996 --> 23:20.464
and we met a pair
of Kinbori who told us

23:20.532 --> 23:22.056
about this game they play

23:22.167 --> 23:24.499
with these big,
odd- looking rackets...

23:24.603 --> 23:26.434
You mean one of those?

23:27.606 --> 23:28.868
Yeah!

23:28.940 --> 23:30.032
Yeah.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.110
l- in any case,
they challenged us

23:32.177 --> 23:33.769
to a game and we accepted,

23:33.845 --> 23:37.144
but l guess we weren't quite
aware of all the rules.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.773
Because you'd been drinking.

23:38.850 --> 23:40.841
Yes, ma'am.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.513
Y- You see, we thought
it was a version of tennis,

23:43.588 --> 23:45.681
but as soon as we
hit the first volley,

23:45.757 --> 23:47.657
this Kinbori jumps over the net

23:47.726 --> 23:49.785
and starts attacking
us with his racket.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.091
So we figured we were
supposed to fight back...

23:52.164 --> 23:53.131
Yeah.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.688
And then, uh...

23:54.766 --> 23:57.132
well, things got
a little out of hand.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.465
''A little out of hand.''

23:59.571 --> 24:04.099
Seven Voyager crewmen,
including two Bridge officers

24:04.209 --> 24:09.374
along with 13 Kinbori
and one Morphinian cafe owner...

24:09.414 --> 24:10.813
all arrested.

24:10.882 --> 24:12.873
The charges range
from disorderly conduct

24:12.951 --> 24:15.044
to assault
on a security officer.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.213
Th- That one's not true.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.483
Oh, thank you, Mr. Kim.

24:18.557 --> 24:20.388
l'll note that exception
in my log.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.019
You're both confined to quarters
until further notice- -

24:23.094 --> 24:25.028
after you report to Sick Bay.

24:25.096 --> 24:26.324
That's all.

24:29.067 --> 24:30.932
Well, did you win?

24:32.404 --> 24:33.894
Oh, yes, ma'am.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.872
We kicked their... rackets.

24:36.942 --> 24:38.204
Good.

24:38.276 --> 24:39.334
Dismissed.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.240
Any progress?

24:44.316 --> 24:46.147
l've determined that we all have

24:46.218 --> 24:48.379
exactly the same gap
in our memories.

24:48.453 --> 24:51.320
lt seems unlikely
that it would be a coincidence.

24:51.389 --> 24:53.050
So you believe the collective

24:53.124 --> 24:55.285
deliberately wiped
your recollections

24:55.360 --> 24:57.157
of the reassimilation process?

24:57.229 --> 24:58.958
lt is the most
likely explanation.

24:59.097 --> 25:00.086
But...?

25:00.198 --> 25:01.756
The collective would not care

25:01.800 --> 25:04.428
that four drones remembered
being reassimilated.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.004
Something must have happened
during the process.

25:07.072 --> 25:09.040
Something they wanted
to hide from you.

25:09.107 --> 25:12.133
Let's look at this from
a different perspective.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.802
Why would the collective

25:13.879 --> 25:16.780
lock them into a neural triad
in the first place?

25:16.848 --> 25:17.780
l don't know.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.476
There is no advantage
to having three drones

25:19.551 --> 25:20.677
linked together in this manner.

25:20.752 --> 25:23.186
Well, they obviously did
it for some reason...

25:23.255 --> 25:25.223
and l get the feeling
that if we can answer

25:25.290 --> 25:27.884
that question, the rest
should fall into place.

25:27.993 --> 25:29.756
But l wish we could find a way

25:29.828 --> 25:32.023
to close the gaps
in your memories.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.033
There is a way.

25:36.134 --> 25:40.070
l assume there's a reason you
didn't mention it before now.

25:40.171 --> 25:43.038
lt would involve linking
my neural interface to theirs.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.838
Together, we may be able
to restore the missing data.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.379
However, l would again
be part of a group mind.

25:48.446 --> 25:52.712
You're not eager to revisit
that experience, hmm?

25:52.784 --> 25:54.581
There's also the possibility

25:54.653 --> 25:57.679
that l could become trapped
in the neural link.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.781
Turning the triad
into a quartet.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.452
l won't ask you to take
that kind of risk.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.653
l do feel compelled
to help them,

26:06.731 --> 26:11.168
but l am uncertain as to
the correct course of action.

26:13.738 --> 26:16.400
Let me ask you something.

26:16.474 --> 26:20.968
Do you think of these people...
as family?

26:23.214 --> 26:25.205
ls it relevant?

26:25.283 --> 26:26.580
There's an old saying:

26:26.651 --> 26:28.448
''Blood is thicker than water.''

26:28.520 --> 26:30.351
lt means that the ties of family

26:30.422 --> 26:33.220
run deeper than any other
kind of relationship.

26:33.291 --> 26:36.021
We'll often do things
for members of our family

26:36.094 --> 26:40.190
we'd never dream of doing
for anyone else.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.497
Seven! Seven!

26:48.607 --> 26:49.699
Naomi Wildman.

26:49.808 --> 26:51.503
l heard about the drones.

26:51.576 --> 26:52.804
Did they hurt you?

26:52.877 --> 26:55.141
l am not damaged.

26:55.213 --> 26:57.147
What do they want?

26:57.215 --> 27:00.150
They are seeking
information from me,

27:00.218 --> 27:03.745
but l am uncertain
whether l can help them.

27:03.822 --> 27:05.187
Oh. Be careful.

27:06.825 --> 27:11.421
Naomi Wildman,
do you consider me to be family?

27:13.164 --> 27:16.759
l... l don't, l mean...

27:16.868 --> 27:18.802
well...

27:18.870 --> 27:20.428
yes.

27:20.538 --> 27:23.006
ls... that okay?

27:23.074 --> 27:25.804
l have no objection.

27:25.877 --> 27:29.438
Do you... think of me as family?

27:31.216 --> 27:32.649
Yes.

27:37.255 --> 27:39.348
Captain's Log, supplemental.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.257
Seven of Nine has decided
to undergo the procedure

27:42.327 --> 27:44.625
that will link her mind
with the other drones.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.129
Despite the risk involved,

27:46.197 --> 27:49.860
she feels an obligation to help
these ''distant cousins.''

27:49.968 --> 27:52.129
l'll be monitoring
your neural readings

27:52.237 --> 27:53.636
while you're in the link.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.502
But l'm not certain l'll be able

27:55.573 --> 27:58.098
to counter the effects
if... you become trapped.

27:58.209 --> 27:59.733
l know you'll do your best.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.072
lt's never a good sign

28:01.179 --> 28:04.444
when the patient feels the need
to comfort the Doctor.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.450
Good luck.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.156
- Ready.
- Ready.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.854
- Ready.
- Ready.

29:15.053 --> 29:16.645
You are damaged.

29:16.721 --> 29:18.313
l will assist you.

29:21.559 --> 29:23.993
Don't worry.

29:24.062 --> 29:26.087
Everything will be all right.

29:49.888 --> 29:52.083
The collective has located us.

29:52.157 --> 29:54.182
A Borg vessel is on its way.

29:54.259 --> 29:56.193
We will be one
with the Borg again.

29:56.261 --> 29:59.025
No! l do not want
to rejoin the collective.

29:59.097 --> 30:00.291
Agreed.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.890
That is in violation of
all established protocols.

30:03.034 --> 30:04.092
Forget the protocols.

30:04.202 --> 30:05.169
You're not a drone.

30:05.236 --> 30:06.464
You're a person, like us.

30:06.571 --> 30:07.538
You have a name...

30:07.605 --> 30:09.163
a life!

30:09.274 --> 30:11.799
All you have to do is embrace
who you really are.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.377
No. l do not exist.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.345
l am only part
of the greater whole.

30:16.414 --> 30:17.711
That's what they
want you to believe.

30:17.782 --> 30:19.215
That's what they want
us all to believe.

30:19.284 --> 30:20.512
We are Borg.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.349
Our primary function
is to serve the collective.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.719
Not anymore.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.186
Error! lnput failure!

30:32.263 --> 30:34.254
They may know what planet we're
on, but without the beacon,

30:34.332 --> 30:35.697
it'll be far more difficult
to locate us.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.792
lf we can remodulate
our cortical implants,

30:37.902 --> 30:39.836
we might be able
to elude their sensors.

30:39.904 --> 30:41.599
We must leave this place.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.641
This discussion is in violation
of all established protocols.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.145
You stay here

30:53.218 --> 30:55.550
and be reassimilated
if you want to.

30:55.620 --> 30:56.985
l won't!

32:02.453 --> 32:04.717
What are you... doing?

32:04.789 --> 32:07.986
The nanoprobes
will create new interlink nodes

32:08.059 --> 32:09.549
in your left hemisphere.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.095
Resistance is futile.

32:58.409 --> 32:59.467
l will not comply!

33:01.679 --> 33:03.647
l will not comply!

33:14.425 --> 33:16.359
State your designations.

33:16.427 --> 33:20.591
Two of Nine,
Primary Adjunct of Unimatrix 01.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.654
Three of Nine,

33:21.733 --> 33:24.896
Auxiliary Processor
of Unimatrix 01.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.027
Four of Nine,

33:26.137 --> 33:28.901
Secondary Adjunct
of Unimatrix 01.

33:28.973 --> 33:30.770
What is your primary function?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.366
To serve the collective.

33:32.477 --> 33:35.105
You will repair
the communications beacon.

33:40.284 --> 33:41.376
lt was you!

33:41.452 --> 33:42.476
You were responsible.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.815
What have you done to us?

33:43.888 --> 33:44.820
You linked us together.

33:44.889 --> 33:46.413
You're responsible
for our suffering.

33:46.491 --> 33:47.549
How could you do it?

33:47.625 --> 33:49.252
lf you didn't want to return...

33:49.327 --> 33:51.090
- To the collective...
- You didn't have to.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.686
You don't understand
what happened.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.200
Somebody help me!

33:58.836 --> 33:59.768
What's happening?

33:59.837 --> 34:01.395
Somehow, they broke
their link with Seven.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.438
They're malfunctioning.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.633
Help me get them to Sick Bay.

34:07.945 --> 34:09.411
When they broke
the connection with you,

34:09.480 --> 34:12.313
it must have overloaded
their cortical implants.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.783
They went into neural shock.

34:14.851 --> 34:17.217
And yet l was undamaged.

34:17.288 --> 34:20.348
l think l know why.

34:20.425 --> 34:22.290
You said you remembered
injecting them

34:22.360 --> 34:24.054
with nanoprobes
eight years ago...

34:24.128 --> 34:26.119
Yes.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.597
lt created an interlink
between them.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.360
lt was the only way
to prevent them

34:30.467 --> 34:31.833
from escaping the collective.

34:31.936 --> 34:34.905
Well, it seems to have had
an unfortunate side effect.

34:34.972 --> 34:36.462
Their higher brain functions

34:36.574 --> 34:38.542
were somehow tied
into the interlink.

34:38.643 --> 34:41.840
When they broke their connection
with you in the Cargo Bay,

34:41.913 --> 34:44.710
the shock to their cognitive
systems was too great.

34:44.782 --> 34:46.079
Can you revive them?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.947
l could remove
the microcortical implants.

34:49.020 --> 34:51.511
That would break the link
binding them together,

34:51.589 --> 34:53.112
but it would also kill them.

34:53.190 --> 34:55.056
They'd only live
a matter of weeks.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.717
A month at the most.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.955
What are the other options?

35:00.798 --> 35:02.925
They could be returned
to the Borg.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.298
lf they were reassimilated
into the collective,

35:05.403 --> 35:06.927
they would regain consciousness

35:07.038 --> 35:08.869
and then live out
a normal life span.

35:08.973 --> 35:10.235
As drones.

35:10.308 --> 35:13.607
As drones,
but they'd be alive, Seven.

35:22.887 --> 35:24.445
They have no hope of surviving

35:24.522 --> 35:26.422
unless they return
to the collective.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.324
Not exactly a happy ending,
is it?

35:29.393 --> 35:30.382
No.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.255
Back on that planet...

35:34.332 --> 35:36.357
why do you think
you reacted so differently

35:36.434 --> 35:37.492
from the rest of them?

35:37.602 --> 35:39.763
Why were you so afraid
of becoming an individual?

35:41.806 --> 35:44.331
When l was first assimilated
into the collective,

35:44.442 --> 35:47.809
l was a child.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.938
They were assimilated
as adults.

35:50.081 --> 35:53.744
When our individual memories
began to resurface...

35:53.818 --> 35:55.809
Yours were of being
a little girl...

35:55.887 --> 35:58.014
a scared little girl.

35:59.891 --> 36:02.325
l let that fear control me.

36:03.561 --> 36:05.688
After l saw the drone
die in the swamp,

36:05.763 --> 36:08.596
l... panicked.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.533
l began to envision
my own death...

36:11.636 --> 36:13.399
alone...

36:13.504 --> 36:17.235
without even the sound of
another drone to comfort me.

36:17.308 --> 36:20.869
So l forced them to return.

36:20.978 --> 36:24.209
l infiltrated their left
cerebral hemispheres

36:24.282 --> 36:27.274
with nanoprobes and created
a new interlink network- -

36:27.351 --> 36:29.410
one that they couldn't resist.

36:29.487 --> 36:32.786
And then l eliminated
the evidence of what l'd done.

36:32.857 --> 36:34.222
You were overwhelmed by feelings

36:34.292 --> 36:35.759
you couldn't begin
to understand.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.555
You're not responsible for that.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.687
Because of what l did,
they'll be forced to live

36:39.764 --> 36:41.891
the rest of their lives
in the collective.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.398
For that, l am responsible.

36:48.906 --> 36:51.204
There's a difference
between surviving and living.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.766
They'll survive
in the collective,

36:53.878 --> 36:56.073
but they won't really be alive.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.012
You know that better
than any of us.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.449
There is no alternative.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.543
How long would they survive

37:03.588 --> 37:06.022
if the Doctor deactivated
this...

37:06.090 --> 37:08.024
interlink network you created?

37:08.092 --> 37:09.616
A month at most.

37:11.362 --> 37:14.297
A month as an individual
or a lifetime as a drone.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.525
Which option would you choose?

37:30.047 --> 37:33.414
Survival is insufficient.

37:33.484 --> 37:35.281
l beg your pardon?

37:35.353 --> 37:37.651
Eight years ago, l forced them
to return to the collective.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.088
l won't make
the same mistake again.

37:40.157 --> 37:44.116
They deserve to exist
as individuals.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.561
We must terminate the link
between them.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.798
l understand that you feel
a certain responsibility

37:50.901 --> 37:52.232
for these patients.

37:52.336 --> 37:55.499
But as their physician, so do l.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.073
lt's my duty
to preserve their lives

37:57.141 --> 37:59.439
for as long as possible,
even if that means...

37:59.510 --> 38:01.535
l will not return them
to the Borg.

38:01.646 --> 38:05.309
Are you thinking of what's best
for them... or for you?

38:05.349 --> 38:07.510
Clarify.

38:07.585 --> 38:08.813
You've said it yourself.

38:08.886 --> 38:09.978
You made a mistake.

38:10.054 --> 38:12.921
And Seven of Nine doesn't like
to make mistakes.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.117
She strives for perfection.

38:15.192 --> 38:19.128
l want you to think about the
motivation behind your decision.

38:19.196 --> 38:22.529
Are you doing what's right
for those three people...

38:22.600 --> 38:25.194
or are you trying to alleviate
the guilt you feel

38:25.303 --> 38:27.134
over what happened
eight years ago?

38:28.706 --> 38:32.506
The damage l did
can never be repaired,

38:32.576 --> 38:35.272
and my guilt is irrelevant.

38:35.346 --> 38:42.081
l simply want them to experience
individuality... as l have.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.780
As you have.

38:43.854 --> 38:46.982
At one time, you were
confined to this Sick Bay.

38:47.058 --> 38:51.461
Your program was limited to
emergency medical protocols.

38:51.529 --> 38:54.828
ln some ways, you were not
unlike a drone.

38:54.899 --> 38:57.265
But you were granted
the opportunity

38:57.368 --> 38:58.630
to explore your individuality.

38:58.736 --> 39:00.465
You were allowed
to expand your program.

39:00.571 --> 39:04.701
Your mobile emitter gives
you freedom of movement.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.039
Your thoughts are your own.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.442
lf you were told

39:08.512 --> 39:12.471
you had to become a drone again,
l believe you would resist.

39:13.751 --> 39:17.118
Yes, l suppose l would.

39:17.188 --> 39:19.622
They would resist as well.

39:19.690 --> 39:24.389
They would choose freedom,
no matter how fleeting.

39:26.697 --> 39:30.599
Only you and l can truly
understand that.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.569
Survival is insufficient.

39:45.649 --> 39:48.641
lt's so... quiet.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.791
l had no idea
you were going to say that.

39:57.695 --> 40:00.289
l don't know what either of you
is thinking.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.624
l'd forgotten what it was like

40:04.702 --> 40:06.897
to be alone
with my own thoughts.

40:10.941 --> 40:12.272
l'm leaving.

40:12.343 --> 40:14.436
Where will you go?

40:14.512 --> 40:17.709
l want to see the space station.

40:17.782 --> 40:20.945
To meet new people.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.280
To fill my life...

40:23.354 --> 40:25.618
with life again...

40:28.025 --> 40:29.993
in the time l have left.

40:55.686 --> 40:58.382
l'm leaving as well.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.357
There's an uninhabited planet

41:01.459 --> 41:04.792
only a few light- years
from here.

41:04.829 --> 41:10.631
l'd like to spend my final days
in the open air.

41:26.150 --> 41:31.349
My people don't believe
in holding grudges.

41:31.422 --> 41:35.290
l wish you well, Seven of Nine.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.827
Thank you.

41:48.405 --> 41:53.934
lt's nice to be on a
Federation starship again.

41:54.011 --> 41:56.878
l'd like to stay
aboard Voyager.

41:56.947 --> 42:00.383
The Captain said you may
stay as long as you wish.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.885
You mean as long as l have.

42:05.256 --> 42:08.987
l can't forgive you
for what you did to us.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.758
But l do understand
why you did it.

42:30.180 --> 42:31.738
Naomi Wildman.

42:31.815 --> 42:35.216
l thought you might
like some company.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.878
Why?

42:36.954 --> 42:39.218
Because of... what
happened with the drones.

42:39.290 --> 42:43.226
l see that word travels quickly.

42:43.294 --> 42:45.762
lt's a small ship.

42:45.829 --> 42:49.697
l thought maybe you might want
to spend some time with...

42:49.767 --> 42:51.758
family.
