that says you can't spend the night.

00:04.640 --> 00:05.520
You're homeless?

00:05.580 --> 00:07.380
Oh,I like to think of it as 
being between home.

00:07.450 --> 00:09.050

I had a miscarriage.

00:13.870 --> 00:15.150
I am so sorry.

00:15.900 --> 00:18.180
I am so sorry.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.770
Milo,you said a few people.

00:19.830 --> 00:22.300
Just you know,I wasn't expecting...

00:22.360 --> 00:24.610
-all men?
-Yeah.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.540
Feel like sharing?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.150
Yeah,sure. Go ahead.

00:28.310 --> 00:30.510
Keep it between us
'cause if rebecca finds out,like...

00:30.580 --> 00:32.409
you're usingecause you're an addict,justin,

00:32.479 --> 00:34.120

-I know it's early.

00:51.910 --> 00:54.020
-how early?
-8:30 A.M...

00:54.090 --> 00:55.960
central time.

00:56.470 --> 01:01.110
Oh.I was having a dream about you.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.990
I was back in high school,
and nobody would have lunch with me.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.340
Was I at the cool table?

01:05.400 --> 01:06.650
No,you were serving food.

01:07.370 --> 01:09.160
You were wearing a hairnet.

01:09.590 --> 01:11.530
Do I even want to know what that means?

01:11.590 --> 01:14.030
It means I'm missing you and I'm hungry.

01:15.310 --> 01:16.510
How are you?

01:16.570 --> 01:20.200
I'm actually,um,
feeling a lot better.

01:20.460 --> 01:22.120
Did you get your schedule?

01:22.160 --> 01:25.660
Yes,and it would be great
if there were 78 hours in a day.

01:25.740 --> 01:27.260
Melanie always overbooks.

01:27.310 --> 01:28.440
She's like an airline.

01:28.490 --> 01:30.090
Yeah. Who's the king of pork?

01:30.250 --> 01:31.470
'Cause he's my 1:00.

01:31.510 --> 01:33.590
Ask melanie.
She's gonna be there any minute.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.850
Maybe I should call her.
come in.

01:37.330 --> 01:38.300
-Melanie.
-Told ya.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.520
Who's the king of pork?

01:39.580 --> 01:42.580
He's the president of the domestic pork
boosters of america.

01:42.630 --> 01:44.600
He's a king and a president.
I like that.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.540
Well,have travis vet him,and make sure
that phil preps you before every stop.

01:47.580 --> 01:48.350
Who's phil?

01:48.370 --> 01:50.720
He's the guy with the bad bow tie eating a danish.

01:50.790 --> 01:54.620
Doughnut.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.150
But you and i could bring back
audeville with an act like this.

01:57.210 --> 01:58.290
I better let you go,sweetie.

01:58.340 --> 02:01.300
But you and i could bring back
vaudeville with an act like this.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.180
You'll be fine.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.830
Just be patient and don't fire anybody.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.070
I love you.

02:06.130 --> 02:07.960
I love you,too.t

02:09.570 --> 02:11.060
ravis.Good morning.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.580
So brief me on the king of pork.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.570
Uh...he owns a chain of restaurants.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.880
Big donor.

02:17.940 --> 02:18.850
But,uh,

02:18.920 --> 02:23.100
senator,there's been a slight scheduling,
uh,mishap.

02:23.170 --> 02:27.430
Your daughter is going to
be landing in des moines in an hour.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.650
No,she's supposed to be here next saturday.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.350
I-I must have gotten the dates mixed up.

02:31.410 --> 02:32.610
-I was-- no,just-
-okay.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.850
It's fine,but you're gonna have to cancel my 1:00.

02:35.910 --> 02:37.240
No,no,no.
What,are you crazy?

02:37.370 --> 02:39.370
It's with the king...of pork.

02:39.450 --> 02:40.750
It's a barbecue.

02:40.810 --> 02:41.980
She'll love it.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.410
Rough night?

02:45.880 --> 02:47.590
mom,i gotta tell you something.

02:48.010 --> 02:49.030
Okay.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.430
Justin's taking drugs again.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.390
Painkillers.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.460
Well,he needs those,right,for his leg?

02:57.530 --> 02:58.370
No,not anymore.

02:58.430 --> 02:59.570
He's supposed to be tapering off.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.300
Now he's just using them to get high.

03:01.380 --> 03:02.450
Oh.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.890
-Is that why you moved out?
-Partly.

03:05.770 --> 03:08.020
I just--I feel so bad.
I wanna help him,but I don't know how.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.320
It's so frustrating.

03:09.370 --> 03:10.670
Well,what does no say?

03:10.740 --> 03:11.870
Nothing. She doesn't know.

03:12.210 --> 03:13.450
Nobody does.

03:13.480 --> 03:15.520
Well,rebecca,you have to tell them.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.960
No.No,I can't tell his family.

03:16.990 --> 03:18.290
Are you kidding me?He'd never forgive me.

03:18.330 --> 03:20.340
There has got to be some other way
that I can help him.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.840
You don't realize how serious this is.

03:23.140 --> 03:26.820
last year,before you knewjustin,
he overdosed.

03:26.880 --> 03:28.540
You have to tell them.

03:28.820 --> 03:30.900
You owe nora that much.

03:31.150 --> 03:32.700
You owe justin.

03:39.980 --> 03:42.590
Dude,what are you doing coming to my job?

03:42.870 --> 03:44.040
I don't do business here.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.230
Bro,I paged you twice.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.070
You didn't call me back.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.130
'Cause I don't have your stuff.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.410
I'll call you when it comes in.

03:48.470 --> 03:49.620
How long?

03:49.690 --> 03:50.890
My guy has rehearsal.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.240
He's in a band,man.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.510
I'm gonnmeet him at 2:00 when my shift is out.

03:53.580 --> 03:54.380
All right,so 2:00?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.580
I said I'll call you.

03:55.660 --> 03:57.570
Look,and don't follow me out neither,okay?

04:05.520 --> 04:06.980
well,I didn't expect to hear from you.

04:07.030 --> 04:08.790
Yeah,no,I'm--I'm sorry.

04:08.830 --> 04:11.440
I probably overreacted.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.750
I shouldn't have left like that.

04:12.820 --> 04:13.860
Yeah,it's okay.

04:14.290 --> 04:16.630
Can I take you to lunch?  My treat.

04:17.810 --> 04:19.089
Uh,yeah.Can we do it early?

04:19.110 --> 04:20.709
I just,uh,I have some plans this afternoon.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.510
Yeah,sure.No problem.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.000
Um,I have to pick up
the rest of my stufat your house.

04:25.050 --> 04:25.880
Why don't we just meet there?

04:26.130 --> 04:27.800
Uh,yeah,sure.
That sounds good.

04:27.870 --> 04:29.890
-Okay.
-All right.Bye.

04:29.960 --> 04:30.960
Bye.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.670
I promise not to make
a habit of working saturdays,saul.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.550
-It's just when joe has the kids,it's the only--
-come on,sarah,it's fine.

04:37.560 --> 04:40.920
I'm just so relieved that
joe came to his senses about sharing custody.

04:41.140 --> 04:43.290
Whatever schedule works for you
and the kids is fine with me.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.800
-thank you.
-Okay.

04:45.690 --> 04:47.310
Ojai foods.

04:47.370 --> 04:50.450

04:56.130 --> 04:57.730
I told you no weekends.Sarah,
look,I have scotty here.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.400
I'm trying to clean...

05:01.430 --> 05:03.400
oh,god.  When?

05:03.430 --> 05:04.800
Tommy,wake up.

05:04.860 --> 05:06.570
Your overslept.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.470
don't you have to get home?

05:09.150 --> 05:10.080
Why?

05:10.720 --> 05:12.030
There's nobody there.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.070
We can spend all day together.

05:14.130 --> 05:15.210
Really?

05:15.410 --> 05:17.210
What do you have in mind?

05:17.980 --> 05:19.080
Bed.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.860
Breakfast in bed.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.250
Tv in bed.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.670
-it's your phone.
-they can leave a message.

05:50.730 --> 05:52.100
what are you looking for?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.730
Uh,quarters for the meters.

05:57.760 --> 06:00.070
Um,is rebecca here?

06:00.130 --> 06:02.000
She's in the living room.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.760
oh,no way.No way.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.370
This is not happing.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.520
what did you do?

06:45.040 --> 06:47.650
Look,I appreciate all your concern
but you're overreacting.

06:47.710 --> 06:49.140
I just saw you go through mom's purse.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.540
-Yeah,for change.
-Really?

06:50.590 --> 06:52.070
Not because you know
that's where she keeps your pills?

06:52.140 --> 06:54.190
Justin,is it--we...

06:54.240 --> 06:56.040
we just wanna have an honest conversation.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.640
Honest,then--then why the ambush?

06:57.670 --> 06:59.310
They told me that was
the only way to get you here.

06:59.360 --> 07:00.240
Ma,i live here.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.420
You didn't need to turn this
into a sting operation.

07:02.510 --> 07:04.730
But now that we're here,
why don't you level with us?

07:04.910 --> 07:06.420
What's going on?

07:14.020 --> 07:15.010
Okay,look,fine.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.390
You know,maybe--
maybe it got a little out of hand.

07:16.460 --> 07:17.670
But it's nothing I can't deal with.

07:17.750 --> 07:18.840
"Deal with"?

07:18.870 --> 07:20.690
Would you like to be a little more specific?
Like when and where?

07:20.760 --> 07:21.910
I don't know,kevin.
Not today.

07:21.950 --> 07:23.560
-I have plans.
-you have plans?

07:23.620 --> 07:24.490
Damn it,justin.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.300
Nothing could be more important than this.

07:27.020 --> 07:29.080
Is that your--is that your take on tough love?

07:29.300 --> 07:31.240
Honey,we just wantwhat's best for you.

07:31.290 --> 07:32.550
Right,because a few weeks ago,

07:32.610 --> 07:34.780
oxycodone was what's best for me.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.100
Mom,you were practically
begging me to take the pills.

07:37.150 --> 07:38.590
You're worse than my drug dealer.

07:38.660 --> 07:40.930
You know,maybe you don't
have a clue what's best for me.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.850
I thought we could control it.
I was wrong.

07:42.940 --> 07:45.020
-Well...mom.Mom,come on.
-I'm sorry,so sorry.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.750
Stop apologizing.
It's not your fault.

07:46.810 --> 07:47.360
-Okay?
-All right.

07:47.410 --> 07:49.050
Justin's gotta take responsibility.

07:49.100 --> 07:50.990
Oh,right,sarah,"ms.Responsibility."

07:51.000 --> 07:54.230
So responsible that
your ex-husband left with yr kids.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.660
-That's relevant.
-Come on,justin.

07:55.730 --> 07:56.780
This isn't about us.This is about you.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.230
Okay,you know what?
You're not my father

07:58.280 --> 07:59.570
so don't act like you are.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.330
Wait.Wait one minute.
Now i think we need to take a break.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.770
We are saying things here
we're all going to regret.

08:03.810 --> 08:04.610
Mo-mom,

08:04.690 --> 08:05.890
that doesn't-- that doesn't help.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.110
-please sit down.look,
-we're not taking a break.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.570
justin,we know you're angry.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.010
Oh,you do?

08:10.250 --> 08:12.150
Wow,that's insightful.

08:12.210 --> 08:13.760
I mean,maybe you guys
should've brought in a professional,

08:13.820 --> 08:15.650
because that level of observation,

08:15.700 --> 08:18.000
me being "angry," is a little lame.

08:18.060 --> 08:19.370
Stop trying to be funny,justin.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.350
-This isn't--
-yeah,whatever.Whatever,kevin.

08:21.430 --> 08:22.300
-You know what's hilarious?
-What?

08:22.380 --> 08:24.390
What are you,like,now 35 years old?

08:24.450 --> 08:27.500
Have--have you ever had a relationship
that's lasted longer than three weeks?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.920
No,you walk around in your suit and tie,
pretending that you're a man.

08:29.990 --> 08:30.940
But you know what?

08:30.980 --> 08:31.770
-You're just a boy.
-Really?

08:31.830 --> 08:33.510
-You're a scared little boy.
-Well,for the record,I have a boyfriend.

08:33.559 --> 08:34.820
I have for--for quite a while.

08:34.870 --> 08:36.620
Yeah,you know what?
Big freakin' whoop.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.280
And what is she doing here?

08:39.320 --> 08:40.730
I'm here for my daughter.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.520
-Justin--
-look,don'T.Don't!

08:42.570 --> 08:44.220
Because you are beyond pathetic.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.440
You spend so much time trying to get
sb to love you that you can't help anybody.

08:47.490 --> 08:49.010
That's enough,justin.

08:49.060 --> 08:50.630
Oh,what are you,the protective mother now?

08:50.700 --> 08:53.380
Because in case you missed it,
your daughter's been living here

08:53.440 --> 08:55.160
all summer,wishing she was a walker.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.570
You know,you two are the same.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.980
You'll do anything-- or I'm sorry--

08:58.030 --> 09:00.220
screw anyone to be part of this family.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.970
-Which,you know,is sad.
-I'm sorry.I can't do this.

09:02.030 --> 09:03.160
-It's--oh,yeah,walk away.
-No,it's all right.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.250
That's the best you can do,right?

09:04.310 --> 09:06.000
Thanks,rebecca.Thanks for coming!

09:06.750 --> 09:08.050
You feel better now?

09:09.970 --> 09:11.440
Oh,wow.Look,it's almost lunchtime.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.880
Isn't this,like,
walker happy hour for you guys?

09:13.930 --> 09:15.760
Maybe you should crack
open a few bottles of wine

09:15.820 --> 09:17.870
so you can actually sit in a room
without killing each other?

09:17.920 --> 09:18.990
You know what I think?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.290
I think it's all of you guys
that have the problem.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.580
Hey--hey,wh-where are you going?

09:23.640 --> 09:24.350
I'm a free citizen.

09:24.410 --> 09:25.340
I have plans today.

09:25.400 --> 09:26.540
I'm leaving.
Is that all right with you?

09:26.610 --> 09:27.130
No,get off me!

09:27.180 --> 09:27.900
-Stop it!
-to go--go get more drugs?

09:27.960 --> 09:29.090
-Stop it!Stop!
-Don't--don't do this!

09:29.140 --> 09:30.650
Stop it!Stop it!Stop it!

09:30.900 --> 09:32.090
Stop it!

09:37.660 --> 09:40.530
Justin,if you walk out the door,

09:40.770 --> 09:42.830
I'm gonna change the locks.

09:42.970 --> 09:43.910
-No,mom.
-Oh,kitty,no.

09:44.220 --> 09:47.220
And if you come back on to the property,
I'm gonna call the police.

09:47.520 --> 09:51.660
Because believe me,I would rather
see you in jail than see you like this.

09:51.670 --> 09:55.050
I'm taking pain medication for pain,okay?

09:55.110 --> 09:56.660
I go to war and I come back,and what?

09:56.710 --> 09:57.810
All right,what?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.600
Have my family attack me like this?

09:59.660 --> 10:00.500
No. We're not attacking you.

10:00.570 --> 10:01.100
Yes,you are!

10:01.160 --> 10:02.240
Yes,you are,mom!

10:02.290 --> 10:03.870
stop it! It's enough.
We all know

10:03.950 --> 10:06.010
justin,that you don't need
pain medication anymore.

10:06.060 --> 10:06.850
You know,why don't--

10:06.900 --> 10:08.790
why don't you get off
the high horse you're on,kitty?

10:09.270 --> 10:10.970
Why don't you just-- what?

10:11.340 --> 10:12.980
What,justin? Go ahead.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.370
Go ahead,say it.

10:14.450 --> 10:15.490
Say it.  What is it?

10:15.720 --> 10:17.070
What is it?
Because I'm here.

10:17.580 --> 10:19.450
I'm here.
I'm--I'm bleeding

10:19.500 --> 10:21.760
and I'm aching because
I've just had a miscarriage,

10:21.810 --> 10:23.930
but I'm here,and I'm dealing with you,

10:23.970 --> 10:25.050
and I'm dealing with your addiction.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.500
So what is it?What is it?
Tell me.

10:26.950 --> 10:28.030
Tell me,come on.

10:28.110 --> 10:30.330
Tell me,what is it that I'm doing

10:30.390 --> 10:33.040
that isn't all about how much I love you?

10:57.270 --> 10:58.970
I'm sorry.I-I...

10:59.680 --> 11:00.670
I didn't mean...

11:02.920 --> 11:05.580
you know what?
I-I-I just need time to think,okay?

11:05.620 --> 11:08.810
No,justin,you need to deal with this now.

11:08.860 --> 11:11.500
we're here,we love you...

11:11.580 --> 11:13.140
And we're gonna deal with it now--

11:13.940 --> 11:16.390
right here...right now.

11:22.070 --> 11:24.240
Now you start importing cheap meat

11:24.300 --> 11:25.810
from third world countries,

11:25.860 --> 11:27.320
you're gonna have
a god-awful problem on your hands--

11:27.390 --> 11:31.410
salmonella,cross contamination,worms.

11:32.690 --> 11:35.920
that's why I voted to increase
tariffs on agricultural imports.

11:35.990 --> 11:39.330
Hmm,which is
why I'm raising cash hand over fist

11:39.400 --> 11:40.530
to get you elected.

11:40.590 --> 11:43.150
Cutler has personally bundled over 100k for us.

11:43.210 --> 11:46.450
Well,iowa is a must-win for us,
so I appreciate anything you can do.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.810
Well,I mean,I'll be grateful
for the V.I.P. Hotel suite

11:49.870 --> 11:51.400
and the luxury box seats
at the convention.

11:51.450 --> 11:54.540
well,we--we--
we can't actually promise that,

11:54.610 --> 11:56.460
but we can,you know,extend every...

11:56.550 --> 11:58.940
legal courtesy.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.950
Oh,I get it.I get it.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.000
Hey,sweetie.

12:04.080 --> 12:05.730
What,you don't like the ribs?

12:05.790 --> 12:07.160
Oh,I'm a vegetarian.

12:07.230 --> 12:08.500
What?Since when?

12:08.640 --> 12:11.940
Well,eating meat is cruel to
animals and ruins our environment.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.820
I-I-I don't know
where kids get these crazy ideas.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.260
oh.That'S...

12:18.310 --> 12:20.790
uh,the thing is,cutler,
our opponent,congressman burgess...

12:20.850 --> 12:22.800
Is polling very well in the rural counties.

12:22.860 --> 12:24.480
No,no,no.
Don't worry about burgess,all right?

12:24.810 --> 12:29.980
We sent out a direct mail flier about
how he voted on that environmental bill

12:30.440 --> 12:33.050
Ever since then,thanks to him,
every time I turn around,I

12:33.280 --> 12:36.420
got some bureaucrat sticking
a thermometer in my waste collection lagoon.

12:36.510 --> 12:38.760
You do know that i voted for that bill as well?

12:38.820 --> 12:42.160
Yes,but you got it right on trade and subsidies,

12:42.210 --> 12:44.220
so we don't talk about that.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.230
hey,cheryl. Wanna come over here?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.540
Mind if we get a little photo op?

12:48.610 --> 12:49.460
Not at all.

12:49.540 --> 12:50.850
Right there,sweetie.

12:50.910 --> 12:52.510
Thank you very much for a delicious meal.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.080
I appreciate everything
you're doing for the campaign.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.140
Oh,my pleasure.

12:55.590 --> 12:56.870
You've gotta promise me next time
you come back,I want you to try

12:56.920 --> 12:58.120
that creamed corn.

12:58.190 --> 12:58.980
You bet.

12:59.210 --> 13:00.480
My mouth is already watering.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.070
-Could I,uh,just have a word?
-Yeah.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.530
We really,really appreciate your support.

13:05.590 --> 13:07.420
So when exactly did you become a vegetarian?

13:07.470 --> 13:09.330
-Well,my boyfriend is into it--
-you have a boyfriend?

13:09.400 --> 13:11.640
I did,but I broke up with him.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.340
-I met an older boy I like way betteR.
-Travis.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.080
Um,cancel my next appointment.

13:16.140 --> 13:19.160
I'm going to take my daughter out
for a vegetarian meal.

13:21.660 --> 13:23.820
-hello?
-Yeah,holly,it's saul.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.910
-Um...
-hey,how's it going over there?

13:25.990 --> 13:27.630
Uh,it's--it's better than before.

13:27.710 --> 13:30.080
I'm calling because I need to find tommy.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.410
I' left messages for him everywhere,
and I can't find him.

13:33.470 --> 13:34.630
Do you have ideas?

13:34.740 --> 13:37.990
Uh,let me give you lena's home number.

13:38.060 --> 13:39.990
Why?It's saturday.
Why would she know?

13:40.050 --> 13:45.300
Saul,I don't think she stops working on saturday.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.790
(everything that's real
and everything I realized...

13:55.870 --> 13:59.220
You know,you keep that up,
and I'll never let you leave.

14:00.350 --> 14:02.750
That's the idea.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.260
that's probably my mom.

14:06.380 --> 14:08.880
she's the only one that ever calls my landline.

14:09.230 --> 14:11.600
-hi.
-Lena,this is saul holden.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.890
Saul.

14:13.210 --> 14:14.170
I need to find tommy.

14:14.240 --> 14:16.090
Uh,I don't know where he is.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.450
Lena,I want you to listen to me.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.580
This is an emergency.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.850
It's about his brother.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.550
It's urgent that I speak to him right now.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.270
It's saul. I'm--I'm sorry.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.460
He says it's an emergeY.

14:31.780 --> 14:33.730
Saul,what is it?

14:34.170 --> 14:36.280
well,I called the doctor,

14:36.360 --> 14:39.250
and they have a room for you waiting
at riverside.

14:40.690 --> 14:42.390
-We'd better get you packed.
-Yeah.

14:44.140 --> 14:45.710
All right,don't freak out.

14:46.340 --> 14:49.730
But mom and I were talking that--
that maybe I don't need to go back to rehab.

14:50.800 --> 14:51.970
No,no.Come on,guys.
We agreed.

14:52.410 --> 14:53.980
-He agreed to get better.
-yeah.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.710
He didn't agree to enter a facility.

14:55.770 --> 14:58.260
Okay,mom,
don't undo everything that'been done.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.590
Look,just hear me out,okay?

14:59.650 --> 15:01.480
Kitty,I know how much the media's watching you,

15:01.540 --> 15:02.890
and the--and the last thing
you and robert need is--

15:02.950 --> 15:04.190
yeah,well,nice try,okay,

15:04.260 --> 15:07.050
but do you think I actually care more
about this campaign than I do about you?

15:07.100 --> 15:08.560
No,but i do,kitty.

15:08.630 --> 15:10.970
All right?You know,I've done
enough damage to everybody here,

15:11.030 --> 15:13.710
and I'd like to detox without
taking anyone else down with me.

15:13.790 --> 15:17.090
So I can do it here if you guys can help.

15:17.150 --> 15:17.880
Well,you know what?

15:17.950 --> 15:19.440
As fun as that sounds,we're not qualified.

15:19.500 --> 15:21.770
Qualified to do what,
watch me throw up,get the shakes?

15:21.850 --> 15:22.880
Look,I know the drill.

15:22.940 --> 15:24.820
Just keep me hydrated
and don't let me out of the house.

15:24.890 --> 15:25.730
That's it.

15:25.810 --> 15:29.080
I don't know
why we can't just do this together.

15:36.380 --> 15:38.070
look just let me try,okey?

15:46.260 --> 15:48.410
you know what?
You guys don't need to sit here staring at me,

15:48.490 --> 15:50.460
waiting for me to grow fangs and hair on my face.

15:50.540 --> 15:53.610
Well,who'd chain you to the radiator
and poke you with a stick?

15:53.660 --> 15:55.830
It's gonna be hours before
I start feeling the withdrawal symptoms.

15:55.910 --> 15:57.150
We're okay.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.560
Well,it looks like your leg has gone ahead
and started without you.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.200
No,that's just nerves.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.070
Okay,so I talked to dr.Kendall,

16:03.130 --> 16:05.600
and he thinks th
with the amount you've been taking

16:05.680 --> 16:07.050
and since it's only been three weeks,

16:07.130 --> 16:10.230
it would be feasible to start a detox
without medical supervision.

16:10.290 --> 16:13.580
But he does prefer that
you go to a-a treatment center.

16:13.660 --> 16:15.510
But if it's feasible,
I think we should do it here bec--

16:15.580 --> 16:17.610
well,he also said that,uh,

16:17.880 --> 16:20.910
addicts typically lie about their intake.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.880
And so,justin,

16:21.950 --> 16:25.280
it could be really dangerous
if you're not telling us the truth.

16:25.350 --> 16:28.510
You know what?
Actually consider myself a-a pretty honest,

16:28.580 --> 16:30.710
thieving,low-life addict.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.040
Does the relentless sarcasm help?

16:34.110 --> 16:35.110
A little bit.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.800
Seriously,justin.

16:38.320 --> 16:39.720
Look,I'm telling the truth.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.680
I promise I'm telling the truth.

16:44.100 --> 16:46.180
okay. Here we go.

16:46.260 --> 16:48.350
Look,and as much as I appreciate the support,

16:48.420 --> 16:50.200
all right,I-I don't need an audience,

16:50.250 --> 16:52.040
especially not my mother and my sisters.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.540
Sorry,you're stuck with us,baby.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.060
Oh,look what the cat dragged in.

16:55.130 --> 16:56.220
-well,tommy.
-hi,tommy.

16:56.270 --> 16:57.130
What's going on?

16:57.190 --> 17:00.700
Saul said you were all high on drugs,
and it was some big emergency.

17:00.780 --> 17:03.380
It is.
This is just a lull between hell

17:03.460 --> 17:05.810
and hell with vomiting.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.980
Yeah,the family is throwing me
an all-night,cold turkey detox party.

17:09.040 --> 17:09.950
It's gonna be good.

17:10.010 --> 17:10.950
Fun times.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.240
-You're kidding.
-No,not kidding.

17:13.410 --> 17:16.140
I've done some research,and--
and we know what we're doing.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.540
-..sort of.
-Sort oF.

17:17.609 --> 17:19.810
All right,well,you just can't
stop screwing up your life--

17:19.859 --> 17:20.670
-are you serious?
-You know what,tommy?

17:20.730 --> 17:22.829
-hey,tommy,this is not--
-this's what happens when you're late.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.890
See,we've already
done the hateful name-calling part.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.490
All right,if this's the"poor little justin"part,
I'm gonna pass.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.010
Honey,why don't you just go upstairs
and help them get the room ready,please?

17:31.070 --> 17:33.600
One question-- whose idea was this?

17:33.660 --> 17:35.010
It was mine.

17:35.090 --> 17:37.620
and nobody found that suspicious?

17:41.020 --> 17:43.630
how manyismatched socks can one person have?

17:43.910 --> 17:46.430
He's certainly not the neatest kid
in the world,that's for sure.

17:46.500 --> 17:49.240
The only dangerous thing on this desk
is an old sandwich.

17:49.940 --> 17:50.910
What's next?

17:50.990 --> 17:52.970
Uh,well,I've looked under the bed.

17:53.050 --> 17:54.530
Why don't you try the closet?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.630
That's funny.I-I didn't mean...

17:57.690 --> 17:59.190
if you don't mind,
I'm gonna go look in the night table,

17:59.280 --> 18:00.700
-if thas okay with you.
-Saul.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.360
Hey. Where have you been?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.470
I was starting to think
you were trying to get out of this.

18:04.540 --> 18:05.650
Uh,I was at the gym.

18:05.730 --> 18:08.400
Well,maybe next time you shouldn't
stray so far from home,tommy

18:08.470 --> 18:10.170
Saul,relax. It's not his fault.

18:16.670 --> 18:18.990
He's watching a movie with sarah.

18:19.280 --> 18:23.130
She not too subtly asked me
to stop "mothering" him.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.850
Stop mothering--
what the hell does that mean?

18:25.910 --> 18:27.760
Mothering...mothering?

18:27.840 --> 18:29.160
No clue.

18:29.240 --> 18:31.100
-Oh,honey,I'm sorry.
-oh.

18:31.560 --> 18:33.140
You're gonna be a wonderful mother.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.200
You get the benefit of--of--
of learning from my mistakes.

18:36.310 --> 18:37.230
You know what? You--

18:37.300 --> 18:39.870
You--you've gotta stop blaming yourself.

18:39.930 --> 18:40.660
Yeah.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.850
You know,maybe you should
go spend the night at sarah'S.

18:43.910 --> 18:46.780
I mean,th-there's no reason for you
to have to go through all this.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.900
No.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.220
I'm not going anywhere.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.040
I'm the one that got him
to start taking the pills again.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.440
This is my fault.

18:53.510 --> 18:56.170
I promed him whatever happened,
I'd go through it with him,

18:56.240 --> 18:57.590
no matter what.

18:59.050 --> 19:00.800
This room is officially clean.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.160
Anybody checked the bathroom?

19:02.220 --> 19:04.710
Yes,tommy.Some of us
have actually been here for hours.

19:04.790 --> 19:06.760
Well,I'm here now.Okay,saul?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.390
Hey,you got something to say to me,say it.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.520
Yeah,I'm going downstairs.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.000
Okay,you wanna tell me
what's going on between you two?

19:22.180 --> 19:24.550
He wasn't at the gym this morning.

19:24.620 --> 19:25.820
He was at lena'S.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.590
-So what's the big deal?
-He was lying.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.320
Lied to...oh.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.510
Wait,you're not seriously suggesting
he's sleeping with her,are you?

19:33.580 --> 19:34.920
I'm just telling youwhere he was,kevin.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.600
So you're insinuating he's having an affair?

19:36.680 --> 19:38.320
-Just draw your own conclusion.
-I will.Okay,

19:38.640 --> 19:40.520
let me get this straight--
pardon the expression--

19:40.590 --> 19:42.640
you go to a gay party,it means nothing.

19:42.710 --> 19:44.790
He spends one day with his secretary,

19:44.840 --> 19:46.350
all of a sudden,
he's having this affair?

19:46.420 --> 19:48.180
You are just not gonna let go of that,are you?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.460
what is it going to take
to get you to understand that...

19:50.560 --> 19:52.790
I am not you,okay?

19:53.400 --> 19:55.410
I know you feel you have a need
to have this company,

19:55.480 --> 19:57.870
-but the point is this--
-I-I have--I have no need for any company.

19:57.940 --> 20:00.250
It's you who's stunningly all alone.

20:03.410 --> 20:07.450
Kevin,you may have grown up in a world
where men walk around in public holding hands

20:07.510 --> 20:12.990
but at the end of the day,you are one of
the loneliest people I have ever known.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.120
are you all right?

20:17.190 --> 20:18.310
-No.I'm going upstairs.
-Whoa,whoa.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.050
Whoa,whoa,whoa,wait.
Wait,wait,I'll come up with you.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.090
No,I can make it by myself.

20:21.160 --> 20:24.140
no,no,justin,
you cannot be alonenot tonight.

20:24.220 --> 20:26.000
Are--are you okay?

20:26.090 --> 20:28.720
Yeah,it's nothing.
I'll be right back.Okay?

20:31.330 --> 20:32.440
Saul,where you going?

20:32.520 --> 20:33.700
Justin's right.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.340
I'm not his father.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.730
This is your family,nora,not mine.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.210
What's the matter?

20:39.280 --> 20:41.050
I can't do it.

20:42.830 --> 20:45.030
I can'T.
I can't be this person anymore.

20:53.660 --> 20:55.630
That's,uh,39 to what?

20:55.710 --> 20:56.840
I forgot.

20:56.910 --> 20:58.990
39?
How long have we been playing this game?

20:59.070 --> 21:01.400
I just never miss,that's all.

21:03.830 --> 21:04.830
you all right?

21:04.910 --> 21:06.220
Dude,stop asking me that.

21:06.290 --> 21:07.690
You know I'm not all right,kevin.

21:07.880 --> 21:11.040
You,uh,you wanna take a couple of free throws,man?

21:13.670 --> 21:14.950
I'm gonna throw up.

21:15.160 --> 21:16.130
Got it. I got it. I got it.

21:16.200 --> 21:17.100
-Hey,hey,hey,hey,hey.
-Shut up.

21:17.170 --> 21:17.890
-We're playing to 50.
-Shut up.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.890
I can make it by myself,all right?

21:20.610 --> 21:23.770
-oh,this is so much fun.
-Hey.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.920
And it's just gonna get better.

21:27.060 --> 21:28.860
Saul was right to leave.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.990
you and I together so he told me
you were at lena's this morning.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.090
Yeah.Yeah,I stopped by her place.

21:38.060 --> 21:39.780
I thought you said you were at the gym.

21:40.290 --> 21:42.020
I was.I went to the gym

21:42.090 --> 21:43.510
and I-I worked out.

21:43.560 --> 21:44.990
I turned my phone off while I was there,

21:45.060 --> 21:46.200
and then I went to lena--
what?

21:46.270 --> 21:47.180
What?
Oh,nothinG.

21:47.250 --> 21:48.720
No,you just seem a little confused,that's all.

21:48.800 --> 21:51.130
Why do you always have to
be such a freakin' lawyer?

21:51.260 --> 21:54.440
Wh-- all right,it was a false alarm.

21:55.770 --> 21:57.590
maybe not.

21:58.650 --> 22:02.230
I have a right to meet with my assistant
without getting the third degree.

22:02.310 --> 22:03.850
Okay,so why are you acting so weird?

22:03.910 --> 22:06.360
Because it's none of your business.

22:06.420 --> 22:09.410
Anyway,who's,uh,who's staying your apartment?

22:10.210 --> 22:11.860
What does that have to do with anything?

22:11.930 --> 22:13.200
I don't know how your team plays,

22:13.270 --> 22:16.060
but I wouldn't invite a hot ex-girlfriend
to crash at my place.

22:16.130 --> 22:17.710
-Why not?
-Because --

22:17.810 --> 22:19.270
something might happen.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.170
did you,uh,tell jason about you
and scotty's little "slumber party"?

22:25.250 --> 22:26.700
No,actually.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.290
-I haven't spoken to him bec--
-right.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.360
Right,right,right,
if there's nothing to hide,uh,

22:30.450 --> 22:31.980
why didn't you tell him?

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
You-- guys,I really need your help.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.750
-Yeah,all right.
-Lay down,man.

22:37.710 --> 22:38.980
-Okay,okay.
-Come here.

22:39.070 --> 22:39.950
Kev,grab that blanket.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.530
I'm sorry I trashed you guys this morning.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.150
You know what?
Tommy wasn't there then.

22:43.220 --> 22:45.560
-So you want to give him his shot now?
-Oh,maybe next time.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.810
-there better not be a next time.
-There won't be,I promise.

22:49.370 --> 22:51.500
I can go faster than you,I bet.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.680
How'd you learn how to do that?

22:54.760 --> 22:59.520
Well,I was the best hockey player in castroville
after the other hockey player moved away.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.910
Do you want me to spin you?
(senator mccallister?yeah,that's him.)

23:00.990 --> 23:04.910
No.Everyone's staring at us.

23:04.970 --> 23:05.900
Who cares?

23:05.970 --> 23:08.200
Well,I wanna sit down,okay?

23:08.930 --> 23:10.020
Okay.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.260
What's bothering you?

23:12.760 --> 23:15.720
Polly schwartz told me that if you get elected,

23:15.790 --> 23:18.350
secret service agents are gonna
watch me go to the bathroom.

23:18.420 --> 23:19.230
Well,that is not true.

23:19.290 --> 23:21.350
They will stand outside
and they'll wait for--

23:21.410 --> 23:23.230
who the hell is polly schwartz?

23:23.300 --> 23:24.960
She's my best friend.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.900
I thought jennifer howard was your best friend.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.980
She is.

23:28.050 --> 23:29.180
They both are.

23:29.250 --> 23:31.350
I see a future in politics for you.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.290
Hey,have you talked to your brother?

23:33.360 --> 23:34.790
I called him this morning
but I haven't heard back.

23:34.860 --> 23:37.320
Oh,he and mom went up to maryland for,
I don't know,

23:37.380 --> 23:40.070
one of his stupid soccer tournaments.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.390
That was this weekend?

23:41.460 --> 23:43.280
Well,yeah,that's why I'm here.

23:43.370 --> 23:44.570
I hate soccer.

23:44.650 --> 23:46.010
I wanted to be there for that.

23:46.070 --> 23:47.700
I was gonna take kitty.

23:49.570 --> 23:51.080
Does she like soccer,too?

23:51.150 --> 23:54.170
Well,she likes jack and she likes you,so...

23:54.240 --> 23:56.500
whatever you guys like,she likes.
(Organ music playing)

23:59.350 --> 24:01.080
are you and kitty gonna have kids?

24:02.390 --> 24:03.900
Why,honey?Would that bother you?

24:03.960 --> 24:05.150
Yeah,kind of.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.750
But it'd probably bother jack more than me.

24:08.830 --> 24:11.780
I mean,'s kind of a baby about that stuff.

24:13.430 --> 24:17.050
Well,I think it's really early
to be worrying about that,okay?

24:17.110 --> 24:19.500
Kitty and I aren't gonna make that
kind of decision for a long time.

24:19.570 --> 24:21.450
Uh,senator,we...

24:21.530 --> 24:23.000
-Uh,sorry.
-oh,sorry.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.980
Uh,we've got a situation.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.390
Something turned up on the king of pork's,
uh,background check.

24:27.450 --> 24:28.340
I thought you already vetted him.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.600
Well,the staff supposedly did,

24:29.650 --> 24:32.680
but it turns out he's under federal
investigation for defrauding investors.

24:32.730 --> 24:34.960
C'S basically a ponzi scheme.

24:35.210 --> 24:37.440
All right,I want you to
get on the phone to fund-raising.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.430
I want refund checks cut
for every donor he bundled.

24:39.490 --> 24:40.320
All right.

24:40.620 --> 24:43.140
-By the morning.
-Right.(music continues)

24:49.430 --> 24:50.550
you look horrible.

24:50.630 --> 24:51.870
Thanks.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.010
want me to get that?

24:53.090 --> 24:54.440
No,no.Let that go to voice mail.

24:54.510 --> 24:55.980
Why?
What is it,your drug dealer?

24:56.050 --> 24:56.960
Oh,give it to me.

24:57.220 --> 24:58.450
I'll put the fear of god in him.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.010
We don't need scarface coming over
with a couple of uzis.

25:01.060 --> 25:03.340
Okay,you know what?
His name is fred,and he's in a band.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.230
oh,my god.
I feel like a truck just ran me over.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.510
Tommy,do something.
Get him a wet towel or something.

25:08.580 --> 25:09.660
-Why don't you go get it?
-I did it last time!

25:09.740 --> 25:12.650
Stop shouting,okay?
My head is killing me.All right?

25:14.540 --> 25:15.710
it's his dealer again.Give it to me.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.000
Not unless he's calling you.

25:17.060 --> 25:18.800
what do you mean?
It's not...oh.

25:18.870 --> 25:20.460
Oh,it's me.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.510
Sorry.oh,it's sarah.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.930
-What?
-Mom wants an update.

25:26.000 --> 25:26.680
is that justin?

25:26.750 --> 25:28.680
No,freddy krueger just came through the window.

25:28.740 --> 25:29.700
Should we call the doctor?

25:29.740 --> 25:32.360
No,we're fi--
look,just tell mom everything's okay.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.270
Okay.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.240
why are you staring at me?

25:40.300 --> 25:41.640
you're sleeping with lena,aren't you?

25:41.700 --> 25:43.250
I'm not sleeping with le--

25:43.300 --> 25:44.830
the question is,are you sleeping with scotty?

25:44.890 --> 25:46.490
I'm in love with someone else.
You know what?

25:46.580 --> 25:49.590
I'm sick of this whole family assuming
I'm gonna screw it up.

25:49.910 --> 25:52.340
Jason's the one who went to malaysia,okay?
Not me.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.570
You know,yeah,I haven't talked
to him about scotty.

25:54.630 --> 25:55.620
You wanna know why?

25:55.980 --> 25:57.940
I never talk to him,ever.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.670
I call him twice a day.

25:59.720 --> 26:01.510
Never calls me back.

26:01.570 --> 26:04.150
Well,isn't he in some remote village somewhere?

26:04.220 --> 26:05.430
Oh,come on.

26:05.510 --> 26:08.370
If I was that important to him,
he'd call me back.

26:10.990 --> 26:13.210
-why didn't you say anything?
-Because I was embarrassed.

26:13.270 --> 26:14.350
Embarrassed?

26:14.820 --> 26:16.610
Well,my wife left me and took our child.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.860
Joe left sarah for his ex-wife,
and there's a drug addict in the bathroom

26:19.920 --> 26:21.940
so...be patient.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.200
-He'll call.
-I am patient.

26:24.510 --> 26:26.070
I wish you'd all acknowledge that.

26:27.030 --> 26:29.430
You know,he's not a saint
just 'cause he's a minister.

26:30.490 --> 26:33.340
-hey,you feeling any better?
-No.

26:33.420 --> 26:34.650
You wanna lie down?

26:34.700 --> 26:35.830
-No,I can'T.
-Why not?

26:35.900 --> 26:37.070
-I just can'T.
-It's okay,

26:37.140 --> 26:38.440
-let's just chill out.
-Everything's--

26:38.480 --> 26:39.930
look,don't touch me,okay?
I'm not kidding.

26:39.990 --> 26:41.690
Okay,calm down. Everything's fine.

26:41.760 --> 26:43.060
Look,I-I can't do this.

26:43.140 --> 26:43.900
-what?
-This isn't--

26:43.960 --> 26:44.650
where...hey,jus?

26:44.720 --> 26:47.100
-Where is he going?
-Justin.Justin!

26:50.290 --> 26:51.710
justin,what are you doing?

26:51.800 --> 26:54.120
Look,just calm--calm down.
You're not going anywhere.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.440
-Just let me out of the house,okay?
-It's not gonna happen.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.080
don't make me shoot you in the back.

27:00.460 --> 27:01.840
Justin.this is ridiculous.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.230
Where do you think you're gonna go?

27:03.300 --> 27:04.450
Justin!

27:04.590 --> 27:05.610
Tommy!

27:05.700 --> 27:07.070
Tommy!
Justin,stop it!

27:07.140 --> 27:08.900
-I can't breathe.I can't breathe.
-What's happening?What's happening to him?

27:08.920 --> 27:09.630
No,please,please,just let me go,

27:09.660 --> 27:10.760
-om,stop.No,he's fine.
-alm down.(ust let me go.)

27:10.820 --> 27:13.950
-you're hurting him.
-I can't breathe.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.470
-Tommy,he can't breathe.
-I can't breathe.

27:15.550 --> 27:16.680
There's something wrong with him.

27:16.750 --> 27:18.550
his drug dealer just called,mom.
That's what's wrong.

27:18.600 --> 27:19.670
No,that's not it,that's not it.

27:19.750 --> 27:20.750
Let me go.

27:20.860 --> 27:23.900
Look,mom,I swear,I need to go outside.

27:23.960 --> 27:25.400
For a couple minutes,I'm just gonna go outside.

27:25.470 --> 27:26.480
I can't breathe,okay?

27:26.540 --> 27:28.140
And I'll be right back in,I promise.mom.

27:28.210 --> 27:29.170
I just can't breathe.Let me go.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.850
No,mom,mom,don'T.

27:32.120 --> 27:36.900
Mom.please.

27:38.340 --> 27:41.340
Mom.mom.mom,don'T.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.330
please.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.220
Mom

27:49.260 --> 27:50.920
Stop it.

27:53.410 --> 27:55.200
You're not going anywhere.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.800
Kitty,call the doctor,please.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.030
All right.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.350
You're going back upstairs with your brothers.

28:02.220 --> 28:05.970
Tommy,kevin,take him back upstairs.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.390
What time is it?

28:33.690 --> 28:36.170
It's 4:00 in the morning.

28:37.000 --> 28:37.720
You want some?

28:37.790 --> 28:39.320
Be careful,mom made it.

28:39.380 --> 28:40.930
We may never sleep again.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.230
Thanks.

28:47.530 --> 28:48.900
I'm sorry I accused you.

28:50.010 --> 28:51.430
It's none of my business.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.710
You were right.

28:54.770 --> 28:56.450
Yeah,I figured.

28:56.550 --> 28:59.750
I feel guilty and terrible,

29:00.170 --> 29:02.140
-but I don't stop.
-Mm.

29:04.020 --> 29:06.470
You wanna know
why I'm letting scotty stay with me?

29:06.850 --> 29:07.850
He's cute?

29:07.930 --> 29:11.010
Yeah,and I'm lonely--
dangerous combination.

29:11.620 --> 29:13.430
-ame for you,huh?
-Exactly.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.610
-what is our problem?
-We're men.

29:15.980 --> 29:18.260
I mean,if history's any judge,
we've never been good at monogamy.

29:18.330 --> 29:20.430
I think it's our history.
That's the problem.

29:20.490 --> 29:23.150
Oh,nice try,but I think
we're this way all by ourselves.

29:23.200 --> 29:26.480
I mean,I didn't know dad was
cheating on mom till after he died.

29:26.550 --> 29:29.470
One thing I did know was
how much I admired him,

29:29.690 --> 29:33.810
and how much I felt like
this confused wimp in his eyes.

29:34.130 --> 29:36.930
-And I was queer,so...
-It doesn't make you special because you're gay.

29:37.000 --> 29:40.330
I felt exactly the same w--
mom.

29:40.390 --> 29:41.690
You're both wrong.

29:42.410 --> 29:45.390
Your father loved and respected you
both very much.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.290
He just had a hard time showing it.

29:47.340 --> 29:48.750
I don't know why.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.730
But get over it.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.880
You're both better men than your father.

29:53.670 --> 29:57.840
And you were as good a dad to justin today
as william walker ever was.

29:57.890 --> 30:00.500
I have never in my life
been so proud of you.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.680
okay.Sphie's sleeping.

30:12.750 --> 30:13.950
Oh,sorry.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.800
Well,everybody's getting their money back,

30:16.850 --> 30:18.020
so you can relax.

30:18.070 --> 30:20.640
This,uh,stuff happens.

30:21.670 --> 30:23.440
"stuff happens."

30:24.390 --> 30:25.830
That's your excuse?

30:26.430 --> 30:27.810
You should've known about this.

30:31.050 --> 30:32.440
You seen this?

30:35.490 --> 30:37.100
I'm gonna live to regret that photo,aren't I?

30:37.170 --> 30:38.250
We don't know that yet.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.570
He hasn't been indicted.

30:39.910 --> 30:42.180
Have you read this direct mailing
he's been sending out?

30:42.260 --> 30:44.040
Yeah.
Yeah,well,it's not just about the environment.

30:44.090 --> 30:46.610
In it,he claims that burgess
murdered a woman in his state

30:46.680 --> 30:48.200
because he let them take her off life support.

30:48.290 --> 30:49.450
Well,obviously,that's a bit of a stretch.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.720
No,it's a lie.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.630
The courts decided that woman's fate,not burgess.

30:52.690 --> 30:54.590
Those mailings were not produced by our campaign.

30:54.660 --> 30:55.880
But they support me.

30:55.940 --> 30:58.190
What are we doing hanging around these lowlifes?

30:58.260 --> 30:59.470
We need the money.

30:59.540 --> 31:01.780
These things are a fact of political life.

31:01.850 --> 31:03.270
I'm sorry if you're offended.

31:03.330 --> 31:06.230
-If you don't want to be in politics--
-Offended?I'm-'m not offended.

31:06.290 --> 31:07.480
Racism offends me.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.270
Wasteful government spending offends me.
This...

31:10.340 --> 31:11.890
well,this is just bad strategy.

31:11.940 --> 31:12.990
Oh.

31:13.480 --> 31:17.810
Look,there are 12 other guys
who do dirty better than I do.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.600
I need a different angle,and not because
I have some naive view of politics,

31:20.670 --> 31:22.850
but because otherwise,
I don't win this election.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.360
Okay.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.290
-I understand.
-Good.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.110
I'm firing your entire team.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.080
Oh,wait a minute,wait-- wait a minute.

31:33.160 --> 31:35.770
Robert,this is a fanttic team.

31:35.820 --> 31:37.360
You are not-- no,no,no.

31:37.430 --> 31:39.750
I'm not letting you or your staff get in my way.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.280
I have given up too much to do this--

31:41.350 --> 31:42.860
sophie's childhood.

31:42.930 --> 31:44.970
Robert,we had a bad day.

31:45.040 --> 31:46.720
You didn't have kitty with you.

31:46.790 --> 31:48.430
After everything that happened with the baby--

31:48.480 --> 31:52.170
it's not about that.I am relieved that
I'm not having a baby now.

31:54.610 --> 31:56.130
Get rid of 'em.

31:58.260 --> 32:00.260
fine.

32:03.270 --> 32:04.440
Why spare me?

32:04.490 --> 32:06.530
If I fired you,it would look like
the campaign's in trouble.

32:06.610 --> 32:09.000
Firing these others
won't even make the "drudge report".

32:09.260 --> 32:10.550
Look,I'm warning you.

32:10.600 --> 32:13.110
Don't mistake my kindness for weakness again.

32:13.550 --> 32:17.560
I am the most ambitious man you will ever meet.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.930
Wheels up in 45 minutes.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.740
I want to see a list of potential staff
replacements on the plane.

32:32.090 --> 32:33.640
I guess I should go.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.420
The doctor said
you should try and get some sleep.

32:36.490 --> 32:40.540
Yeah,unless he gave you some sleeping pills,
that's gonna be pretty tough to pull off.

32:40.610 --> 32:42.270
Yeah,well,you're out of luck.

32:43.950 --> 32:44.900
come on.

32:45.570 --> 32:47.020
-Kitty?
-Mm-hmm?

32:49.110 --> 32:50.980
I'm sorry about your baby.

32:51.570 --> 32:56.200
I should've said something earlier,but,
you know,I-I've been so messed up,and...

32:57.590 --> 33:00.290
I don't know,
sometimes I think it was for the best.

33:01.510 --> 33:04.240
I'm not sure I'm cut out for motherhood.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.320
Kitty,you're crazy.
You're gonna be a great mother.

33:06.380 --> 33:09.360
Well,that's what everybody says,but...

33:09.430 --> 33:12.500
I-I don't how do-- how do you know?

33:13.230 --> 33:15.050
Well,you know,
maybe you don't know yourself so well,

33:15.110 --> 33:17.430
because last night,you know,

33:17.660 --> 33:19.080
you took care of me so well.So you know what?

33:19.160 --> 33:20.630
Oh,please.Please,no.

33:20.700 --> 33:21.750
I-I--what?

33:21.820 --> 33:25.420
I-I was organizing,
making phone calls,making lists...

33:25.460 --> 33:27.640
Ordering everybody around,anD...

33:29.110 --> 33:30.210
you all right?

33:30.270 --> 33:31.700
Yeah,my head's hurting.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.330
Mm.here.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.010
Does that help?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.910
Yeah,thanks.

33:44.050 --> 33:46.250
Look,just keep talking.
I'm listening.

33:46.330 --> 33:49.020
Oh,it's just,you know,sarah...

33:49.090 --> 33:50.290
she's an amazing mother.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.960
She just oozes maternal.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.120
And--and mom,she's the same way.

33:54.180 --> 33:55.640
And I'm just not like that.I'M...

33:55.700 --> 33:58.670
I guess the cuddle gen just skipped me.

33:58.740 --> 34:01.750
You know,I'm all sharp points and--

34:01.810 --> 34:04.660
and tough talk and crankiness.

34:04.730 --> 34:08.210
And I-I mean,
I-I fight with people for a living.

34:09.020 --> 34:12.960
You know,what--
what if I'm not warm and maternal?

34:15.580 --> 34:17.199
Justin?

34:32.360 --> 34:33.469
Hey.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.190
-Saul.
-How's justin?

34:36.860 --> 34:38.210
He's fine.

34:38.280 --> 34:41.090
He's been asleep for a few hours,thank god.

34:41.739 --> 34:43.210
I've been more worried about you.

34:43.270 --> 34:44.210
Oh.

34:44.270 --> 34:46.250
-No,I'm fine.
-No,you're not fine.

34:46.760 --> 34:48.420
You ran out of here like a crazy person.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.420
You scared me to death.

34:49.469 --> 34:50.639
What do you mean,

34:50.730 --> 34:52.000
you "can't be this person anymore"?

34:52.060 --> 34:53.830
What person?
What are you talking about?

34:54.420 --> 34:57.250
Look,I shouldn't have said
what I did last night,

34:57.310 --> 34:59.960
and I'm sorry.
I came here to apologize.

35:00.020 --> 35:01.100
Well,that's lovely,

35:01.160 --> 35:03.790
but I still don't know what's going on.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.740
You don't have to know everything,nora.

35:09.540 --> 35:11.160
We all have secrets.

35:12.330 --> 35:15.870
Oh,saul,if you have some health issu
that you're hiding from me--

35:15.920 --> 35:18.830
there's nothing wrong with me physically.
I promise.I'm fine.

35:20.150 --> 35:21.570
It's just hard.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.820
You know,your kids are
the closest thing I have to a family.

35:27.890 --> 35:30.960
And it's not that I don't love
coming here for their birthdays

35:31.050 --> 35:33.420
andx holidays.And it'S...

35:35.630 --> 35:37.330
it's just not my family.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.860
I wish I had found someone that I could've--

35:40.920 --> 35:45.980
god,you know,I have always wanted you
desperately to find somebody to love.

35:46.050 --> 35:47.950
How do you know that I haven't?

35:47.990 --> 35:49.570
Stop talking in circles.

35:49.650 --> 35:51.360
Nora,I am not who you think I am.

35:51.420 --> 35:53.830
My husband was in love with another woman
for most of our marriage.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.450
Well,I was in love with a man.

35:58.830 --> 36:00.400
How about that?

36:02.600 --> 36:03.980
You were what?

36:04.500 --> 36:06.910
Oh,god,nora,it was so many years ago.

36:08.640 --> 36:10.090
I...why didn't you tell me?

36:10.140 --> 36:12.370
Because--because it was a different time.

36:12.430 --> 36:15.790
Different time?
I was there.I'm your sister.

36:16.860 --> 36:19.360
-See,I shouldn't have told you.
-Yes,you should have told me.

36:19.420 --> 36:23.120
You should havetold me a long time ago.

36:23.190 --> 36:24.460
Saul,I'm so con--

36:24.530 --> 36:28.300
I'm so confused.
I mean,the women you were with and...

36:28.380 --> 36:29.430
hello?

36:29.500 --> 36:30.910
Oh,no.

36:31.830 --> 36:33.760
Kev,could you just please give us a second?

36:33.830 --> 36:34.500
Why?What's wrong?

36:34.570 --> 36:35.790
Nothing.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.400
I'll see ya.I have to go.

36:37.460 --> 36:38.760
Saul,please don't go.

36:38.820 --> 36:41.320
-Please.Please don't go.
-Okay.Hi,kevin.Can I say something?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.730
Saul?

36:47.430 --> 36:48.870
Everything's fine.

36:48.940 --> 36:49.910
Is he all right?

36:49.960 --> 36:51.000
Who?

36:51.060 --> 36:52.120
Saul.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.560
Oh,yeah,he's fine.

36:54.460 --> 36:57.370
Why?
Is there something you're not telling me?

36:58.440 --> 36:59.620
no.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.360
No,as far as I know,he's fine.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.020
Oh.

37:03.100 --> 37:05.570
Well,fine.

37:05.620 --> 37:07.010
Just fine.

37:14.830 --> 37:16.030
Hello?

37:19.570 --> 37:22.460
I brought you bagels from iowa made of corn.

37:22.530 --> 37:24.810
-You want one?
-No,I just want you.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.310
How was your trip?

37:31.660 --> 37:33.260
-Productive.
-Really?

37:33.490 --> 37:36.680
I,um,fired a quarter of the staff.

37:36.750 --> 37:39.300
You did not.oh,no,you did not.

37:39.350 --> 37:40.360
Yeah.

37:40.430 --> 37:41.830
Yeah,it was time.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.150
Okay.

37:44.710 --> 37:47.890
Okay,I'm too exhausted to
be as mad at you as I should be.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.870
-did you get any sleep?
-Uh,no,no.

37:52.170 --> 37:54.940
But...don't ask.

37:58.500 --> 38:02.170
Robert,I don't want to wait to get married.

38:03.860 --> 38:06.810
I-I...I want to get married now.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.410
I mean,there's never gonna be a good time,

38:08.460 --> 38:11.070
and if you're president,
there's never gonna be any time.

38:11.990 --> 38:13.540
I like vegas.We could go tonight.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.320
Uh,we could,but it's not just that.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.770
I really want to have a baby.

38:21.730 --> 38:23.880
I really want to start trying.

38:27.530 --> 38:29.940
It's just that I-
I thought that we'd agreed that...

38:30.000 --> 38:32.280
you know,this wasn't the best time.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.500
Oh,I know.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.710
I know,we--we did,but,um...

38:41.470 --> 38:43.870
I guess I was kidding myself.

38:44.670 --> 38:47.600
I...I just really want this.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.660
you really want this,too,don't you?

38:56.540 --> 38:58.210
yes.x

38:58.990 --> 39:01.940
Or in the sun there's nothing
more important to me than you,

39:02.170 --> 39:04.320
not even this campaign.

39:09.830 --> 39:13.270
And unlike politics,trying to
have aaby might even be fun.

39:13.330 --> 39:15.680
Think globally,act locally...

39:16.490 --> 39:18.160
I always say.

39:19.390 --> 39:22.890
So what,this is,like,the...third time now?

39:24.150 --> 39:26.530
I can't do this to my family.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.870
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.470
I'm sorry it took you this long to figure it out.

39:35.270 --> 39:37.990
you know what?
Can you just--can you just go?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.010
Of course.Um...

39:40.810 --> 39:43.790
I promise I won't make this difficult at work.

39:43.850 --> 39:46.650
Yeah,I can't wait to see
how you're gonna pull that one off.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.000
scotty?

40:24.050 --> 40:25.400
Hi.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.120
You're up.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.270
You slept all day.

40:31.790 --> 40:33.520
I had a dream you locked me in the house.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.320
It wasn't a dream.I did.

40:37.320 --> 40:40.410
And you had superpowers,
but I was sure I knew how to beat you.

40:40.500 --> 40:41.270
How?

40:41.330 --> 40:42.880
Crying and whining,basically.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.600
Did you finally wake up?

40:46.340 --> 40:49.060
Yeah,I did.

40:49.850 --> 40:53.270
yes,so did I.

40:58.230 --> 41:01.320
things have to change,justin.

41:02.990 --> 41:04.240
I know.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.070
Look,I'm trying to be a man,mom.

41:08.140 --> 41:13.290
No,I mean,between us,the two of us.

41:14.070 --> 41:16.470
Are you breaking up with me?

41:19.490 --> 41:21.090
I'm holding you back.

41:24.580 --> 41:28.240
we got stuck,you andme,and...

41:29.310 --> 41:31.340
we have to let go.

41:33.700 --> 41:34.820
I know.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.920
changes,so many changes.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.280
it's nice out,huh?

41:46.330 --> 41:48.070
Yeah.

41:50.390 --> 41:52.150
I'm actually getting a little hungry.

41:52.210 --> 41:53.740
Good.

41:53.810 --> 41:55.440
That's progress.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.840
You feel like making me some oatmeal?

41:58.300 --> 42:00.180
You're a man.
Make it yourself.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.320
Wow,it a brave new world.

42:05.210 --> 42:06.610
I'll say.

42:08.870 --> 42:12.510
Maybe we should just stay out here
a little while longer.

42:15.340 --> 42:17.270
That sounds nice.

42:17.350 --> 42:21.410
