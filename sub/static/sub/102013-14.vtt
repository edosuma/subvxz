we start negotiating.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.732
Yeah. And we get
an ambulance for Tamura.
Mm.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.567

an accidental death.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.330
A missing woman

06:54.372 --> 06:55.998

07:10.847 --> 07:13.182
You were in the newspaper
for that.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.351
So Rose got all the attention,

07:15.393 --> 07:17.812
and Dolores fell by the wayside?

07:17.854 --> 07:19.480
FRASER:
Our resources were
stretched too thin

07:19.522 --> 07:20.940

07:20.982 --> 07:23.901
I hated that, so
I went into policy.

07:34.579 --> 07:38.416
Huh. No wonder
she wasn't found.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.630
Rose goes missing;

Okay, Aunt Mei,

07:51.304 --> 07:52.930
why are you communicating
through Ace?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.474
(old woman's voice):
Because I wanted to know

07:54.515 --> 07:56.225
what it's like
to be a tall white man,

07:56.267 --> 07:59.562
so when you called on me,
I thought, here's my chance.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.981
Now what do you
need from Aunt Mei?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.816
Okay, good. Okay.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.030
We need your help finding
a woman named "Mary Clarke"

08:09.071 --> 08:10.656
from the spirit world.

08:10.698 --> 08:12.700
Uh, she's from England,
dead for 200 years.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.535
All we have is
a letter from her.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.662
We were hoping that you
could, uh, track her scent,

08:16.704 --> 08:18.164
you know, like
a bloodhound.

08:18.206 --> 08:19.874
Like a dog?

08:19.916 --> 08:22.919
Do you think
that's how we work?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.087
Yeah.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.508
What do you want
with Mary Clarke?

08:28.549 --> 08:30.760
I have a very

08:30.801 --> 08:34.555
pushy ghost trapped inside
my body named Odette Lamar,

08:34.597 --> 08:36.641
and I agreed to
help her find Mary.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.100
See, Xiao Lan?
This is what happens

08:38.142 --> 08:39.602
when you don't go to college.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.395
I'm gone three years,

08:41.437 --> 08:42.813
and nothing's changed.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.190
And now you're housing a ghost.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.733
How did I fail you so badly?

08:45.775 --> 08:47.235
I have my own path.

08:47.276 --> 08:48.819
It's not a path
if it doesn't go anywhere.

08:48.861 --> 08:50.571
That's a hole in the ground.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.865
Okay, Aunt Mei... (laughs)
Let's take a breather.

08:52.907 --> 08:57.245
You're our only hope right now,
so please.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.748
Fine. But on one condition.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.377
Xiao Lan, you need
to bring me my reading glasses.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.087
Find my glasses,
I'll find Mary Clarke.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.964
See, I told you
she'd want something.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.132
I'll go check
lost and found.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.680
I'm a person of interest?

09:15.721 --> 09:17.181
According
to the file,

09:17.223 --> 09:19.809
you were the last person
to see Dolores alive.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.352
You want to get out of
here, you start talking.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.604
All right, okay,
yeah, I had dinner

09:23.646 --> 09:25.231
at the Blue Iris that night,

09:25.273 --> 09:27.108
and I'll tell you
what I told the cops then.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.485
I noticed Dolores because
she'd had quite a few drinks.

09:33.155 --> 09:35.241
She looked wasted.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.868
(keys jingling)

09:37.910 --> 09:39.620
And so, later, when I heard

09:39.662 --> 09:41.372
she'd driven off a ravine,
I mean,

09:41.414 --> 09:42.999
it kind of tracked.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.459
That's pretty cold.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.420
It is what it is.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.131
Voice on the speaker seems to
think there's more to the story.

09:50.172 --> 09:53.175
Yeah. He seems to think someone
here knows what happened to her.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.011
Yeah, because he's crazy.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.929
All right,
let's just wait him out.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.348
My wife knows where I am.
She's gonna notice

09:59.390 --> 10:00.891
when I don't come home.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.476
Uh, hey, guys, I think
we've got a leak here.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.020
(buzzer sounds)

10:04.061 --> 10:07.315
THE ARBITER:
Seems you need more motivation.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.318
(yelling, shrieking)

10:12.278 --> 10:14.864
If you don't figure out
what happened to Dolores

10:14.905 --> 10:17.241
in one hour, I send
the next electrical charge

10:17.283 --> 10:20.870
through the floor.
The clock starts now.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.251
Boss.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.878
You made your point!

10:28.919 --> 10:31.213
Turn off the water,
so we can work!
Please!

10:36.302 --> 10:38.804
Can you get him
to open the door?

10:38.846 --> 10:41.265
One step at a... time.
Boss!

10:41.307 --> 10:43.225
Hey, hey, we need to
get you some help.
What we need

10:43.267 --> 10:45.853
is a working theory
for when he calls back.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.022
Hampton, Fraser,
go over every step of this case,

10:48.064 --> 10:49.523
find out what you missed.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.651
Sure thing.
Nick, Nancy, with me.

10:51.692 --> 10:53.444
Let's go see if there's
anything in Evidence.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.237
GEORGE:
Found 'em, Aunt Mei.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.114
They were in
lost and found.
What else did you find?

10:57.156 --> 10:58.783
Your ambition?

10:58.824 --> 11:01.243
A husband? A future?

11:01.285 --> 11:03.287
Walked right
into that one.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.831
I always hoped
you would get out of this place,

11:05.873 --> 11:08.959
not end up
like your mother.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.587
(sighs)
Put them on me,

11:11.629 --> 11:14.340
like you used to.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.803
♪ ♪

11:26.227 --> 11:27.853
So...

11:27.895 --> 11:30.356
that's what you look like.
That's what you look like.

11:30.398 --> 11:32.066
(chuckles)
Every time.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.652
Aw. Better?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.946
Good. Great. Nice.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.407
Um, so now that you can see,
you can look for Mary Clarke.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.701
Ghosts don't need glasses.
I just didn't feel like myself

11:41.742 --> 11:43.828
without them.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.955
Give me this letter.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.338
Save those.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.965
(exhales)

11:56.006 --> 11:58.384
Items from her car
and her glove compartment.

11:58.426 --> 12:00.678
Photos of
the wreckage.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.640
What's that right there?
On her back fender.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.225
Nick's a car guy.
I get it.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.561
I'm just
an actual detective.
It looks like

12:08.602 --> 12:10.604
a transfer of red paint
from another vehicle.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.398
Maybe it was a hit-and-run.
HAMPTON:
If Nancy's right

12:12.440 --> 12:13.983
and we're all here for a reason,

12:14.024 --> 12:15.985
well, I started running
cross-checks on everyone.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.236
The night Dolores went missing,

12:17.278 --> 12:19.321
Ryan Hudson was arrested
for a DUI.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.407
What was he driving?

12:22.366 --> 12:23.951
Porsche.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.536
A red one.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.913
I don't, I don't think
I hit her.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.374
You don't think
you hit her?

12:30.416 --> 12:32.251
No, I...

12:32.293 --> 12:36.797
In 2013, I was...
I was drinking to...

12:36.839 --> 12:40.176
blackout levels,
and on occasion,

12:40.217 --> 12:42.219
I was dumb enough
to drive, so...

12:42.261 --> 12:44.597
NANCY:
Ryan, you were arrested
on Monday, March 11,

12:44.638 --> 12:47.933
at 6:15 p.m.
near Mill Road and Delowe.

12:47.975 --> 12:50.269
Do you remember
where you were coming from?

12:50.311 --> 12:53.773
Uh, if... well,
if it was a-a Monday,

12:53.814 --> 12:57.651
um, I had therapy
at 4:00, so...

12:57.693 --> 13:01.071
Hey, what about
if you skipped it that day?

13:01.113 --> 13:03.032
Couldn't have skipped it.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.075
It was mandatory.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.954
My father's brother Josiah
died of alcoholism,

13:08.996 --> 13:12.208
so he had a zero tolerance
for... for that,

13:12.249 --> 13:16.670
and... back then
I was way above zero.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.341
Look... to be honest,

13:20.382 --> 13:22.927
I don't, I don't even remember
getting pulled over.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.887
Okay? I...

13:24.929 --> 13:27.848
I remember I went to therapy,
and then after that,

13:27.890 --> 13:31.727
I went to happy hour
at the yacht club, and...

13:31.769 --> 13:34.146
next thing you know, I'm here,
I'm getting processed,

13:34.188 --> 13:37.733
and then it's fuzzy
from that point on.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.777
I remember they put me
in a freezing cell.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.863
The pipes were moaning,
and the toilets didn't work.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.241
When was Dolores
at the restaurant?

13:45.282 --> 13:47.034
Her credit card
was run at 6:08 p.m.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.452
NANCY:
Then Ryan couldn't
have killed her.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.831
BRANDON:
You sure about that?
Mm-hmm.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.250
Or is this like the time
you said Everett Hudson

13:54.291 --> 13:55.835
put a bomb
on a cargo ship,

13:55.876 --> 13:57.378
and then you recanted
your testimony?

13:57.419 --> 13:59.713
Ryan was coming
from therapy and a happy hour

13:59.755 --> 14:01.632
near the yacht club.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.885
Dolores, at 6:08 p.m.,
was at the Blue Iris.

14:04.927 --> 14:08.472
There is no way that Ryan
could have crossed paths

14:08.514 --> 14:10.558
with Dolores before
he got pulled over.

14:10.599 --> 14:11.767
She's right.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.228
That is a relief.
Yeah.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.480
For him, maybe.
But Rich and Drunk over here

14:16.522 --> 14:19.275
was our only lead, so now
how do we get out of here?

14:24.697 --> 14:28.742
You know, I'm-I'm not the guy
that I was back then.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.911
I know.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.998
What's their deal?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.833
Hudson and Drew.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.419
You think he's the reason
why she recanted her testimony

14:38.460 --> 14:42.089
and let Everett Hudson walk free
from 12 murder charges?

14:42.131 --> 14:45.050
Maybe get back to wondering
about the missing Black woman

14:45.092 --> 14:47.803
who's been ignored
for the last six years.

14:51.932 --> 14:55.227
You suggesting
I'm not?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.687
(chuckles)

14:56.729 --> 14:59.982
I'm suggesting that...

15:00.024 --> 15:03.986
crimes against Black women
are underreported...

15:04.028 --> 15:07.948
under-investigated
and under-solved.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.619
So maybe...

15:11.660 --> 15:14.038
if Dolores had been white,

15:14.079 --> 15:16.749
more people would have been...

15:16.790 --> 15:19.710
asking about her.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.712
Maybe...

15:21.754 --> 15:23.964
they could have found her.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.092
Maybe even
saved her.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.721
I wasn't here then.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.100
You're here now.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.356
You're on a mission.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.482
Yeah, well...

15:43.150 --> 15:45.361
It's because of me that
Bashiir and 12 other men

15:45.402 --> 15:47.279
on the Bonny Scot are
being denied justice.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.531
So the least I can do
is get it for Dolores.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.742
Didn't Brandon say
that Dolores looked drunk?

15:51.784 --> 15:52.993
Yeah. Why?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.412
Hey. Buried
at the bottom of the pile.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.040
This business card was
on the floor of Dolores's car.

15:58.082 --> 15:59.875
"Mitzi Channing
Realty"?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.627
Yeah. There's insurance info
on the back.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.129
Kind of stuff you write down
after an accident.

16:04.171 --> 16:08.550
And isn't that Mitzi
leaning up against a red car?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.721
I didn't kill Dolores Barrett.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.556
We all know that
there was an accident.

16:14.598 --> 16:16.392
So did you hit her
with your car?

16:16.433 --> 16:17.643
No!

16:17.685 --> 16:19.395
Then why'd she have
your card?

16:19.436 --> 16:21.480
I-I, um...

16:21.522 --> 16:23.107
(sighs, stammers)
Okay, look,

16:23.148 --> 16:24.858
look, she-she hit me.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.777
Okay? Okay. We were--
I mean, we were--

16:26.819 --> 16:28.112
we were coming out
of the restaurant

16:28.153 --> 16:29.446
at the same time, and then sh...

16:29.488 --> 16:31.323
she just backed her car
into mine.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.617
And then sh-she tried
to give me cash,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.537
and I said that I wanted
to do it the right way.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.539
And then she just got
really aggressive

16:38.580 --> 16:41.083
and she drove off.

16:41.125 --> 16:44.211
So you were the last one
to see Dolores alive.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.213
You didn't want to
mention that before?

16:46.255 --> 16:47.506
(buzzer sounds)

16:47.548 --> 16:49.717
THE ARBITER:
You have a problem.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.885
Carson Drew is outside.

16:51.927 --> 16:54.972
(thunder rumbling)

16:55.014 --> 16:56.807
If he makes it to the door,

16:56.849 --> 16:57.933
he'll die first.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.852
But he won't be the last.

16:59.893 --> 17:01.353
Make a call.

17:01.395 --> 17:02.688
(dial tone)

17:02.730 --> 17:05.232
(panting)

17:05.274 --> 17:06.984
(phone rings)
Carson Drew.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.153
Dad, it's me. Tamura says
you're in the parking lot.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.572
Yeah. I haven't heard back
from the judge yet.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.490
I'm so sorry. But I brought you
something to eat.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.909
I don't need you to white-knight
your way in here.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.911
I am not a child.

17:17.953 --> 17:21.248
I don't want a-a "Goldilocks and
the Three Bears" bedtime story.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.625
So take your misplaced concern

17:23.667 --> 17:26.712
and your birthday pie
and your twisted candles

17:26.754 --> 17:28.714
and go home!

17:34.845 --> 17:36.930
(thunder rumbling)
(beeps)

17:45.647 --> 17:47.733
(crickets chirping)

17:51.445 --> 17:53.322
Mm.

17:53.363 --> 17:54.573
(whispers):
Yeah, she's gone.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.660
(clears throat) So why does
she call you Xiao Lan?

17:58.702 --> 18:00.079
Is that your
Chinese name?

18:00.120 --> 18:02.164
No.
(inhales)

18:02.206 --> 18:04.166
It's her weird nickname for me.
(exhales)

18:04.208 --> 18:06.835
It means "Little Lazy."

18:06.877 --> 18:09.838
Anytime I did something slowly
or wrong,

18:09.880 --> 18:11.840
she thought
that would motivate me.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.468
That's not a very
motivational name.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.554
I mean, like, "Unyielding
Lioness" or "Spine of Steel,"

18:17.596 --> 18:19.681
that's motivational...
Mei thought
if she went easy on me,

18:19.723 --> 18:21.683
I would underachieve.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.894
She wanted me to succeed
and be reliable.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.813
Well, you are
massively reliable.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.189
I wasn't.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.358
Not when it counted.

18:29.399 --> 18:30.359
(door opens)

18:30.400 --> 18:32.528
(bell jingles)
Whoa.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.863
Nancy's being held hostage
at the police station,

18:34.905 --> 18:36.532
and we have to save her
without tipping anyone off.

18:36.573 --> 18:37.991
Can you help?

18:38.033 --> 18:39.118
That sounded like a question,

18:39.159 --> 18:41.078
but it was really a statement.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.919
(brakes squeak)

18:48.961 --> 18:50.337
BESS:
Okay,

18:50.379 --> 18:52.548
so, Mr. Drew,
you're absolutely 100% positive

18:52.589 --> 18:55.384
this is a hostage thing?
"Goldilocks" is
code name for a game

18:55.425 --> 18:57.302
that Nancy and I used to
play when she was a kid.

18:57.344 --> 19:01.348
It means, "Pay attention to the
third thing I'm about to say."

19:01.390 --> 19:03.934
The three bears. The third
thing was always "just right."

19:03.976 --> 19:07.938
Nice game. And "twisted candle"
is... an old case of hers?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.773
Robbery at a
department store.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.525
Mm.
The criminals
booby-trapped the exits,

19:11.567 --> 19:13.735
took hostages in
the home goods section

19:13.777 --> 19:15.028
and Nancy led the cops
through a secret basement,

19:15.070 --> 19:16.405
saved everyone.

19:16.446 --> 19:18.615
Okay, so the-the police station
exits are...

19:18.657 --> 19:20.284
Most likely electrified.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.369
Which is why I was hoping
Ace might be able to help me

19:22.411 --> 19:24.204
with the power grid and
maybe the security cameras.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.831
But you say
Ace is...

19:25.873 --> 19:27.499
Uh, he's soul-searching.
Jesse's with him.
Yeah.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.085
I was actually thinking we
could use the rubber floor mats

19:30.127 --> 19:32.004
in the car to insulate us
from the electric charge.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.006
That's a great idea.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.591
Great.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.010
Okay. And if
these don't work,

19:38.051 --> 19:40.220
maybe we can scale
the side of the building,

19:40.262 --> 19:42.472
hope to find a
trapdoor on the roof.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.141
Look at us. Who needs Ace?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.145
Scale the building?

19:51.607 --> 19:53.984
(sighs)

19:54.026 --> 19:56.737
He's in pretty rough shape
and getting worse.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.906
He needs a doctor.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.994
Tell them
what you just told me.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.829
I, um...

20:05.871 --> 20:07.664
I saw them fighting

20:07.706 --> 20:08.957
outside the restaurant
that night.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.959
D-Dolores.
(shudders)

20:11.001 --> 20:12.085
And Brandon.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.881
And I didn't tell you
earlier because I'm...

20:15.923 --> 20:17.049
I'm afraid of him.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.091
What?

20:18.133 --> 20:19.509
I mean, Dolores,

20:19.551 --> 20:20.928
she was furious.
And it was like they were--

20:20.969 --> 20:23.347
they were having, like,
a lovers' quarrel.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.890
I mean, you grabbed her arm,

20:24.932 --> 20:26.475
and she pulled away.
No, no, I--

20:26.516 --> 20:28.227
She was drunk.
I just-- I tried helping her.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.103
She freaked.
RYAN: Okay, I found
this earlier.

20:30.145 --> 20:34.942
This is a statement to the cops
from Dolores's mom, Linda.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.362
"My Dolores is a sweet
girl who loves flowers.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.364
She's never even
smoked or drank."

20:40.405 --> 20:41.907
BRANDON:
Okay. (chuckles)

20:41.949 --> 20:44.326
Guys, come on. Of course
her mother's gonna say that.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.702
Right? I mean...
(buzzer sounds)

20:45.744 --> 20:47.454
THE ARBITER:
Do you believe Brandon?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.248
No.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.833
Why-why would
you tell him that?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.919
I'm watching a pizza
get delivered

20:53.961 --> 20:56.380
to 404 Guilford Lane.

20:56.421 --> 20:57.714
FRASER:
Guilford Lane?

20:57.756 --> 20:59.841
He's watching
Brandon's house?

20:59.883 --> 21:00.801
That's not my house.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.178
It's mine. My family.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.763
He's threatening
my family

21:04.805 --> 21:06.223
because you
keep lying!
Hey, wait!

21:06.265 --> 21:08.058
Hey!
I swear to God,
if he hurts

21:08.100 --> 21:10.060
my family because
of your lies...
Listen!

21:10.102 --> 21:12.312
You were arguing with Dolores.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.897
You grabbed her arm.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.149
Because I didn't
want her to leave!

21:16.191 --> 21:17.943
You knew her,
didn't you?

21:17.985 --> 21:20.153
Didn't you?!
We dated!

21:20.195 --> 21:21.780
For a few months.

21:21.822 --> 21:23.782
Were you married back then, too?

21:23.824 --> 21:25.826
Is that why she came to town--
to break up with you?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.703
(sighs)

21:27.744 --> 21:29.871
She threatened
to tell my wife.

21:29.913 --> 21:32.207
I just... I wanted her
to see my point of view.

21:32.249 --> 21:34.334
I wanted her to hear me out.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.170
And then she left,
so I went inside,

21:37.212 --> 21:39.423
and I drank till last call.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.341
And then my wife picked me up.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.386
(panting)

21:44.428 --> 21:45.637
So I have an alibi.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.514

21:47.556 --> 21:50.267
Oh, my God.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.311
His skin's cold.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.105
Okay, he's got a pulse,
but just barely.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.444
CARSON:
Okay, George, Bess, here we go.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.946

Okay.

Wait, wait! Stop!

22:09.786 --> 22:11.413

Stop, stop! It's ripping.
It's ripping. It's ripping.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.499
No. What?

22:17.586 --> 22:20.714
Detective Tamura needs a doctor.

22:23.050 --> 22:27.012
Please! I will get justice
for Dolores.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.557
I want to balance the scales,
but I can't do that

22:30.599 --> 22:33.435
if another innocent person dies!

22:34.770 --> 22:36.521

22:36.563 --> 22:38.648

22:39.566 --> 22:41.443
Are you all right?
I don't know, but

22:41.485 --> 22:43.904
we have to hurry. He could turn
the power back on any second.

22:43.945 --> 22:45.405
Okay.
Hey!

22:45.447 --> 22:46.823
Bring Tamura! He goes
first. The door is open.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.200
Grab Tamura!
Come on, let's go!

22:48.241 --> 22:49.993

Uh, hey, there...

23:04.091 --> 23:06.843
There is a line.
The day after
Dolores disappeared,

23:06.885 --> 23:08.512
a flower-shaped
topaz earring

23:08.553 --> 23:10.847
was found here.
I've seen that earring before.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.225
We both have. Remember?

23:14.976 --> 23:17.104
Dolores was in this station
the night she went missing.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.022
CARSON:
Hurry up! We got
to get out of here! Come on.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.399
MITZI:
Wait your turn.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.858
Dad, here's what I want
for my birthday.

23:21.900 --> 23:23.652
Trust me one more time.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.696
Rearm the doors!

23:26.738 --> 23:28.657

(electrical whirring)

23:28.698 --> 23:30.117
What are you doing?!

23:30.158 --> 23:31.410
Somebody here
is still lying.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.912
Somebody knows
what happened to Dolores!

23:33.954 --> 23:36.873
And nobody is leaving until
we find out how she died.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.708
I'm the Arbiter now.

23:46.466 --> 23:48.427
This makes you
an accomplice.

23:48.468 --> 23:50.095
Arrest me.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.141
An earring

23:54.182 --> 23:56.143
identical to one
of Dolores Barrett's was found

23:56.184 --> 23:58.478
in the precinct the morning
after she disappeared.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.105
It was logged
as an unclaimed possession,

24:00.147 --> 24:01.606
and then someone
tore the page out.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.024
Why was she
in the precinct?

24:04.025 --> 24:06.027
Ryan, you were there that night.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.529
Do you remember
seeing her?

24:07.571 --> 24:09.489
Nah, I was wasted.

24:09.531 --> 24:12.242
I mean, I didn't sober up
until I walked home at midnight.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.953
At midnight?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.538
Yeah.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.584
Because this says

24:20.625 --> 24:22.752
that you were released
at 8:00 a.m. the next day.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.713
Okay, well, that's
definitely not true,

24:24.754 --> 24:27.466
because when I got out,
no buses were running,

24:27.507 --> 24:30.093
and my car was in the
impound so I had to walk.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.012
Plus, it was... it
was dark outside,

24:32.053 --> 24:33.513
like-like
midnight dark.

24:33.555 --> 24:35.098
BRANDON:
Why would you
release him

24:35.140 --> 24:37.058
ahead of schedule,
and then alter the records?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.060
Maybe they didn't want him
to see what happened

24:39.102 --> 24:41.188
after midnight.
(phone ringing)

24:43.106 --> 24:45.108
TAMURA:
Nancy, I just got Internet
back on my phone.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.611
Dolores was pulled over
the night she disappeared.

24:47.652 --> 24:50.197
I accessed the DMV database.
Her plates were run.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.491
Who pulled her over?

24:53.950 --> 24:55.952
It's not what you think.

24:55.994 --> 24:59.289
You arrested
Dolores. Why?
(Fraser sighs)

24:59.331 --> 25:01.416
Okay.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.214
Dispatch got a
call from Mitzi

25:07.255 --> 25:10.175
about a Black woman
driving erratically.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.552
She said Dolores
had a ton of cash

25:12.594 --> 25:15.514
and that she was
probably a drug dealer.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.057
No, no, I didn't.
I didn't. I said...

25:17.098 --> 25:19.267
I said possible drug dealer.

25:19.309 --> 25:22.187
I mean, every-everyone is
a possible drug dealer, right?

25:22.229 --> 25:23.772
FRASER:
So when I pulled
Dolores over,

25:23.813 --> 25:25.857
and I saw that wasn't
the case, I let her go.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.235

FRASER:
I didn't mention it
earlier because

25:33.240 --> 25:38.995

25:48.838 --> 25:50.674
'Cause why else
would Hampton

25:50.715 --> 25:52.509
have threatened me
earlier tonight?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.804
Yeah, she told me that if I said
I called the cops on Dolores,

25:55.845 --> 25:57.639
that it would get out

25:57.681 --> 26:01.643
that I weaponized the police
against a Black person.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.479
And then, it would be all over
the Internet, and that people--

26:04.521 --> 26:06.648

26:06.690 --> 26:08.066

was moaning pipes?

26:23.832 --> 26:26.376
I-I thought it was.

26:26.418 --> 26:29.963
It was this high-pitched...

26:30.005 --> 26:32.382
It sounded
like crying.

26:32.424 --> 26:34.175
That's because
it was crying.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.094
It was Dolores Barrett
crying, wasn't it?

26:39.764 --> 26:41.891
What'd you do to her?

26:41.933 --> 26:43.768
HAMPTON:
I didn't...

26:46.354 --> 26:48.440
Hey.

26:49.733 --> 26:53.361
Please, please,

26:53.403 --> 26:55.780
just tell us the truth.

26:57.657 --> 26:59.618
Fraser brought her in that way.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.620
Not another

27:01.661 --> 27:04.539
He said if I didn't
cover for him,

27:04.581 --> 27:06.207
he'd make sure
I never got backup again.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.792
She's lying.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.587
HAMPTON:
Dolores came in
holding her head,

27:10.629 --> 27:12.464
sobbing.

27:12.505 --> 27:14.799
(muffled):
Please.

27:14.841 --> 27:17.719
Please help me. Please.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.763
I wanted to call the doctor,

27:19.804 --> 27:22.724
but Fraser said,
"No. They all do that.

27:22.766 --> 27:26.227
They all call
for their mothers."

27:26.269 --> 27:28.563
Then Dolores
had a seizure!

27:28.605 --> 27:32.150
She was bleeding
inside of her head.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.986
She died in
front of us.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.447
We panicked.

27:38.740 --> 27:42.285
We threw her car
in the ravine and...

27:42.327 --> 27:44.871

insane story, really?

from that night.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.758
Even though
you told me not to.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.303

28:00.345 --> 28:01.930
The video shows it all.

28:05.517 --> 28:07.686
It was an accident!

28:07.727 --> 28:09.813
She was resisting!

28:11.106 --> 28:13.274
She pulled away.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.443
Probably because
she was terrified.

28:17.904 --> 28:21.991
Because we are
always terrified.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.662
Brandon,
you harassed her.

Hey.

Fraser,

as she cried out for help
in a holding cell.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.020

her murder,

31:34.976 --> 31:36.436
and the police department
back then.

31:36.477 --> 31:37.729
Someone who still does.

31:39.355 --> 31:43.484
On the phone tonight, I heard
the faintest ringing sound.

31:43.526 --> 31:45.778
THE ARBITER:
Tonight, I am the Arbiter.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.448
Someone here knows what happened

31:48.489 --> 31:50.033
to Dolores Barrett.

31:50.074 --> 31:52.160
(bell tolling)

31:55.538 --> 31:58.082
Church bells.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.627
Ringing on the hour.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.633
So, the same question goes
for you, Reverend.

32:06.674 --> 32:09.636
Do you have
a confession to make?

32:18.978 --> 32:21.940
How long do I have
before the authorities arrive?

32:21.981 --> 32:24.859
NANCY:
I didn't tell them about you.

32:35.328 --> 32:37.455
In 2013,

32:37.497 --> 32:39.624
after they published
Dolores's photo,

32:39.666 --> 32:42.210
I realized
it was her earring I found

32:42.251 --> 32:44.337
that morning
in the holding cell.

32:44.379 --> 32:46.714
And when I asked them about it,

32:46.756 --> 32:49.634
they insisted someone else
had claimed the earring.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.720
But I knew in my heart
that wasn't true.

32:52.762 --> 32:56.224
I could tell
they had done something to her.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.852
For years, I prayed for justice.

32:59.894 --> 33:02.146
And then Dolores's mother
died last week,

33:02.188 --> 33:05.817
and I decided to make
that justice happen myself.

33:05.858 --> 33:08.945
But I needed to make
sure they would confess.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.906
And for that to happen,
I needed pressure.

33:13.408 --> 33:17.120
When I heard Tamura and the D.A.
discussing your arrest warrant,

33:17.161 --> 33:19.664
I finally had my chance.

33:21.582 --> 33:24.961
I was a mechanical engineer
before I went to the seminary,

33:25.003 --> 33:28.715
so rigging up the water
and electrical was simple.

33:28.756 --> 33:30.842
Still...

33:31.926 --> 33:34.303
I'm sorry Tamura's hurt.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.514
Tamura's gonna be okay.

33:36.556 --> 33:38.683
(exhales)
Good.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.560
He's just about to head

33:40.601 --> 33:42.353
into surgery soon.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.775
I read you recanted
your testimony

33:47.817 --> 33:49.861
against Everett Hudson.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.363
Doesn't seem like you.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.409
I don't know who I am anymore.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.872
Matthew 7.

34:02.790 --> 34:06.210
"Every good tree
bringeth forth good fruit,

34:06.252 --> 34:09.756
but a corrupt tree
bringeth forth evil fruit."

34:09.797 --> 34:13.176
One's choices tell the
world who they are.

34:13.217 --> 34:16.304
What will yours
say about you?

34:24.854 --> 34:27.231
BESS:
Okay, what do you mean,

34:27.273 --> 34:28.649
you can't find Mary Clarke?

34:28.691 --> 34:30.193
Yeah, and why did you wait

34:30.234 --> 34:32.320
until after you ate the dessert
to tell us?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.407
(old woman's voice):
Mary Clarke moved on.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.827
The spirits who knew her
whispered her story to me.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.829
After Odette died,

34:41.871 --> 34:44.665
Mary grieved, healed,

34:44.707 --> 34:47.210
but eventually found love again.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.712
A great love.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.465
She had a full life

34:52.507 --> 34:56.844
and died in old age
surrounded by family.

34:56.886 --> 35:00.598
Odette was only a very small
part of Mary's long story.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.225
ODETTE:
Menteuse!

35:02.266 --> 35:03.976
She lies.

35:04.018 --> 35:08.064
I died with Mary's name
in my heart.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.900
She was waiting for me.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.528
Waiting for me to return.

35:13.569 --> 35:16.405
Oh, Odette.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.825
I'm sorry.

35:21.285 --> 35:23.621
BESS:
Yeah.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.499
(exhales)
Thank you

35:26.541 --> 35:28.584
for trying, Aunt Mei.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.017
Aunt Mei...

35:48.104 --> 35:50.690
I'm sorry that I didn't
come to visit you

35:50.731 --> 35:52.942
when you needed
me the most.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.820
I just... I didn't want
my last memory of you

35:55.862 --> 35:57.947
to be sick
and hooked up to IV tubes.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.449
It was... It was really selfish.

36:00.491 --> 36:01.868
Xiao Lan.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.996
Do you think
that's why I've come?

36:05.037 --> 36:06.455
To scold you?

36:06.497 --> 36:09.375
No, you do
plenty of that yourself.

36:09.417 --> 36:12.420
For better or worse,
my voice is in your head.

36:12.461 --> 36:15.840
Yeah. Sure is.

36:15.882 --> 36:19.051
Then hear me tell you this.

36:19.093 --> 36:20.678
Like Mary Clarke,

36:20.720 --> 36:24.348
I, too, died surrounded
by family and love.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.559
Your love.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.647
It lives with me,
and it always will.

36:36.110 --> 36:37.820
Give me your hand.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.363
(chuckles, sniffles)

36:39.405 --> 36:42.200
My palm hasn't changed.

36:42.241 --> 36:44.577
But you have.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.789
I read all the clippings
on the wall in here.

36:48.831 --> 36:52.168
Co-owner of this restaurant.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.921
And Ted is class president.

36:54.962 --> 36:59.508
You have done a very good
job raising your sisters.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.011
Really?

37:02.053 --> 37:04.847
Just because I never told
you I was proud of you

37:04.889 --> 37:06.390
doesn't mean I'm not.

37:06.432 --> 37:10.519
But, Xiao Lan, I'm
scared for you.

37:10.561 --> 37:14.690
You must find a way to untangle
Odette's soul from yours.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.984
Look.

37:17.026 --> 37:20.655
Your palm has changed.

37:20.696 --> 37:25.117
Your life line is beginning
to merge with Odette's.

37:25.159 --> 37:28.329
Your original line
had a rocky start

37:28.371 --> 37:31.165
but ended up
happy and long.

37:32.124 --> 37:34.669
Odette's life line

37:34.710 --> 37:37.213
is violent and brief.

37:38.881 --> 37:41.759
If you do not find a way
to sever your connection,

37:41.801 --> 37:44.428
your life line will
be greatly shortened.

37:45.805 --> 37:49.475
Reclaim your
destiny, George.

37:49.517 --> 37:51.560
I do not want
to see you again

37:51.602 --> 37:55.273
until you're an
old lady like me.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.363
(ghostly exhale echoes)

38:05.866 --> 38:08.411
(normal voice): Don't take this
the wrong way, but you...

38:08.452 --> 38:11.539
You don't have to keep
hugging me if you don't want to.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.748
Oh. (chuckles)

38:12.790 --> 38:13.958
Ooh. (sniffles)

38:14.000 --> 38:15.960
Sorry. Uh...

38:16.002 --> 38:17.586
Whoo.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.588

38:21.549 --> 38:23.175
You okay?

38:23.217 --> 38:25.219
Yeah.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.346
But you're not.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.808
I heard what
Aunt Mei said.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.688
Just do me a favor?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.732
Don't tell anyone.

38:39.108 --> 38:42.486
I don't want to ruin
Nancy's party later, okay?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.074
Just open the fridge
real quick. Awesome.

Why did you pick

40:01.023 --> 40:05.236
It's the anniversary of
the Gettysburg Address.

40:05.277 --> 40:09.323
Kate had a mild obsession
with Abraham Lincoln,

40:09.365 --> 40:14.120
so we named Nancy
after Lincoln's mother.

40:14.161 --> 40:16.872
And during his
first inaugural,

40:16.914 --> 40:18.416
he coined a phrase:

40:18.457 --> 40:21.043
"the better angels
of our nature."

40:21.085 --> 40:23.796
And that's who
Nancy was to us.
