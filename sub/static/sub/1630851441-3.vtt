WEBVTT

00:08.299 --> 00:09.718
Previously on
"The Lost Symbol"...

00:09.759 --> 00:11.302
This is breakthrough stuff.

00:11.344 --> 00:13.138
And we may only be
scratching the surface.

00:13.179 --> 00:15.181
BLAKE: Zachary Solomon died
in a prison riot in Turkey.

00:15.223 --> 00:17.225
-We need Langdon.
-What about Peter Solomon?

00:17.267 --> 00:19.436
MAL'AKH (recording):
Peter is in the borderland

00:19.477 --> 00:21.187
-between Heaven and Hell.
-He might already be dead.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.398
-LANGDON: It's a piece of rock.
-It's a map!

00:23.440 --> 00:24.733
The pyramid and the capstone

00:24.774 --> 00:26.651
will reveal the location
of the portal.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.112
The Hebrew... it's code.

00:29.154 --> 00:31.448
LANGDON (voice-over):
The ring could contain
some kind of decryption.

00:31.489 --> 00:32.866
I am doing what you wanted.

00:32.907 --> 00:33.867
MAL'AKH:
You were told to do it alone.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.160
Cut her loose.

00:39.664 --> 00:40.749
MAN:
Hey!

00:40.790 --> 00:42.667
Hey, you can't be in here, man.

00:42.709 --> 00:44.377
Park's closed.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.879
Let's see some ID.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.506
-Hey!
-(grunting)

00:51.468 --> 00:52.761
-(gunshot)
-(yells)

00:55.305 --> 00:57.349
(monitor beeping steadily)

01:03.521 --> 01:06.441
The doctors say his partner
should make a full recovery.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.278
What about him?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.364
SATO:
Too early to say.

01:14.324 --> 01:18.286
NUÑEZ:
I got sent 7,000 miles away
to fight extremists.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.165
This isn't your fight.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.378
I got a hole in my side
that says otherwise.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.923
Some evidence went missing
yesterday.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.549
Peter Solomon's ring.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.635
You happen to know anything
about that?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.804
What are you saying?

01:35.845 --> 01:37.514
I'm saying if--

01:37.555 --> 01:39.182
hypothetically--

01:39.224 --> 01:41.768
you were aiding
Langdon and Katherine,

01:41.810 --> 01:44.688
you'd only be putting them
in more danger.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.525
You can't protect them
from the guy who did this.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.487
You don't have to worry
about me.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.323
I'm done playing the hero.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.369
Made my wife a promise.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.414
Make sure you keep it.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.804
-Home sweet home.
-Hmm.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.806
Oh, you make tostones, babe?

02:19.848 --> 02:22.308
ZOE:
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.727
What?

02:23.768 --> 02:25.854
KATHERINE:
Welcome home.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.481
-Hey.
-How you feeling?

02:30.608 --> 02:31.901
Hungry.

02:31.943 --> 02:34.446
I said you guys
could set up here,

02:34.487 --> 02:36.656
-to crack your Bible code,
not eat all my food.
-Oh.

02:36.698 --> 02:39.743
I'll leave you
to your new friends.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.331
-Maybe we should go.
-No. She's fine.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.292
She's just worried about me.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.045
Besides, I wouldn't go anywhere
right now.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.338
We got a lurker.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.341
Three houses down, north side.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.723
-He's found us.
-No, it's Sato's people.

03:01.765 --> 03:03.558
She came to the hospital
looking for you two.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.060
And if you're wrong
and it's Mal'akh

03:05.101 --> 03:07.312
or someone he sent, what then?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.731
Why would he do that?
He needs you.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.318
What's going on with you?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.736
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.820
Don't bullshit me, Robert.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.911
There's something
I haven't told you.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.999
He called when we were
at the library.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.292
Who?

03:29.334 --> 03:31.419
Mal'akh.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.342
And he made it very clear
that he wants me doing this

03:37.384 --> 03:38.677
on my own.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.764
Without you.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.601
-And you didn't tell me this
before?
-I didn't want to scare you.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.937
Right.
Or maybe you agree with him.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.440
Maybe you think you'd be
better off doing this alone.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.776
-It's not about agreeing
with him.
-He has my father.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.528
-It's about acknowledging the
very real danger he presents.
-I'm not going anywhere.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.113
He has a literal assassin...

03:58.154 --> 04:00.657
And that's what it's going
to take to get me to stop.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.500
* *

04:30.687 --> 04:33.523
Mr. Bellamy, Ellison Blake,
Central Intelligence.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.442
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.360
Oh, I doubt that.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.656
Looks like you put
your time here to good use.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.867
Caught up on a little reading.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.828
Uh, I miss books.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.457
Sci-fi-- that was my first love.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.958
I know it's not high art,

04:52.000 --> 04:53.793
but the stakes--

04:53.835 --> 04:57.547
I mean, how can you beat a story
about the end of the world?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.967
I don't get much time
to read anymore.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.802
Not fiction.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.805
But that's okay,
because I've come to realize

05:05.847 --> 05:08.391
that the most
interesting stories...

05:09.184 --> 05:11.061
...are true.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.482
I don't know what that is.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.775
I do.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.821
That's the sign
for the Leviathan Group.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.991
It's a secret sect
within the Freemasons,

05:25.033 --> 05:27.535
to which you belong.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.497
I also know that their purpose
is to protect

05:30.538 --> 05:33.583
some very old,
very valuable information.

05:35.126 --> 05:38.546
So my question for you is:

05:38.588 --> 05:40.507
where is it?

05:40.548 --> 05:42.926
This portal
that I've heard about.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.057
I don't know
what you're talking about.

05:49.099 --> 05:53.186
But I do know
that you can't keep me here.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.481
No.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.191
Not here.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.656
Any word on Langdon?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.825
Not yet. Got people looking.

06:06.866 --> 06:10.120
-What about him?
-Mm, he's the quiet type.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.914
I think he could use
a change of scenery.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.626
Have him moved over
to Southwoods.

06:21.673 --> 06:24.259
LANGDON (quietly):
All right, where are we?

06:24.300 --> 06:27.679
Okay, it's an equation.
Maybe an equation.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.014
Maybe a...
Or coordinates?

06:29.055 --> 06:30.223
Maybe coordinates.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.850
No.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.226
So what else?

06:33.268 --> 06:35.937
(sighs) Ciphers...
A Hill cipher.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
Maybe a Hill cipher.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.483
It's right here.
It's right here.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.027
(pencil tip snaps)

06:42.068 --> 06:43.653
Damn it.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.239
(Langdon sighs)

06:46.281 --> 06:48.616
-Back to anagrams?
-Back to nowhere.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.119
Clearly, a cipher was used
to alter the Hebrew,

06:51.161 --> 06:52.954
likely one with...

06:52.996 --> 06:55.081
Masonic characteristics
or themes.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.168
I-I j... I just cannot
figure out what it is.

06:58.209 --> 07:00.628
Well, maybe it's related
to the Solomon story.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.630
When Dad talked
about the Masons,

07:02.672 --> 07:04.924
he always said it was
a beautiful system of morality

07:04.966 --> 07:06.926
-veiled in allegory.
-Veiled in allegory, yes.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.262
It's in there,
hiding in plain sight.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.099
-(pouring tea)
-I should be able to see it,
but I... can't think.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.518
I'm blocked.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.936
(sets teakettle down)

07:16.978 --> 07:19.147
(takes deep breath)

07:19.189 --> 07:20.899
Please reconsider.

07:20.940 --> 07:22.650
-No.
-My-my brain, it...

07:22.692 --> 07:25.195
it can't work if I'm
constantly worried about you.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.697
Well, that's very sweet,
but I'm not gonna let this guy

07:27.739 --> 07:29.991
tell me that I can't participate
in saving my own dad's life.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.703
But... we're not gonna save him
if I can't work this out.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.789
-We are going to work this out,
Langdon.
-Katherine...

07:35.830 --> 07:37.832
At some point,
you are going to realize

07:37.874 --> 07:39.918
-that you actually need me,
you know that?
-You have vast knowledge

07:39.959 --> 07:41.044
in-in many topics.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.672
Codebreaking isn't one of them.

07:46.049 --> 07:49.552
It's not my knowledge
that's important, it's yours.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.180
The key to decoding this
is buried in your mind...

07:52.222 --> 07:54.099
and I know how to dig it out.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.558
Uh...

07:57.894 --> 07:59.979
(water burbling)

08:13.785 --> 08:15.787
He's getting weaker.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.248
But we can't rush the process.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.917
You know that better
than anyone.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.133
This things belonged to his boy.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.303
They will find him in the Araf.

08:34.931 --> 08:39.019
Then he will see himself
for who he truly is.

08:45.650 --> 08:49.654
(echoing whisper):
What is the predominant wish
of your heart?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.077
Has his daughter surfaced?

08:56.119 --> 09:00.373
No. She's still off the grid,
as far as I can tell.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.709
If they've ignored my warning...

09:03.668 --> 09:06.338
...then they must be made
to understand.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.435
(dog barking in distance)

09:25.940 --> 09:27.776
(quietly):
Okay.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.916
Trish.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.168
Aw, that's so sweet.
You got me cannolis?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.920
That's my jam.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.004
Oh. Okay.

09:48.046 --> 09:49.381
(chuckles)
We're hugging.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.467
Come on inside.
Did you get a new EV?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.886
-Yeah.
-That looks great.
How many miles are you getting?

09:54.928 --> 09:57.263
-What?
-Yeah.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.141
Hang tight.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.727
(quietly):
Okay.

10:04.312 --> 10:07.232
Thank you so much for coming.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.525
Yeah.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.735
So, who was that?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.362
And why am I sneaking you
lab equipment

10:12.404 --> 10:14.989
-disguised as baked goods?
-I'll explain later.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.533
You're kidding, right?

10:16.574 --> 10:18.118
Listen, I know
how this is gonna sound,

10:18.159 --> 10:19.327
but the less you know
the better.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.204
Is everything okay?

10:21.246 --> 10:23.832
Everything's fine. I promise.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.875
Um, I'm just really pressed
for time,

10:25.917 --> 10:27.293
but I can't thank you enough
for coming

10:27.335 --> 10:28.795
-all the way out here.
-Mm.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.380
And I'll call you tomorrow.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.341
(sighs)
It's your name on the door.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
Hey, do me a favor?

10:35.427 --> 10:38.054
Say goodbye to the complete
stranger that just hugged me?

10:38.096 --> 10:40.265
(mouths)

10:48.898 --> 10:51.901
That's tight.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.238
So what's this thing do, anyway?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.449
It lets Katherine reprogram the
parts in me she doesn't like.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.284
Oh, no, that requires
much more equipment.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.913
With all the cryptographic data
you've absorbed over your life,

11:03.955 --> 11:05.915
it's not a question
of having the answer.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.584
We know it's in there.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.419
There's just
too much other noise.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.964
With auditory stimuli that
can boost neurological activity,

11:13.006 --> 11:15.133
we can elicit your
frequency following response,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.594
drown out that noise
and find it.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.596
Ah.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.431
It would be best
if we had a closed environment.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.475
Ah, yeah.
Sure, I'll leave y'all to it.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.435
(sighs)

11:25.477 --> 11:27.395
Lie back. Relax.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.161
Interconnecting our energies
will help you relax.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.125
Listen to the beats,

11:49.167 --> 11:51.169
to the sound of my voice.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.463
Inhale slowly.

11:55.507 --> 11:58.301
Good. And exhale.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.390
Concentrate on your feet.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.475
They're warm...

12:05.517 --> 12:06.434
heavy.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.523
Let that warmth flow up
through your body.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.859
And as it does...

12:14.901 --> 12:18.321
feel your body growing heavy
as well.

12:18.363 --> 12:22.075
And as you feel your body
become heavier

12:22.117 --> 12:24.452
and warmer,

12:24.494 --> 12:28.206
feel yourself sinking
into the floor...

12:30.208 --> 12:33.169
...being enveloped
by the warmth beneath...

12:35.588 --> 12:39.050
...being delivered
to a new place...

12:39.092 --> 12:44.139
where all of your knowledge
and experience reside.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.370
(inhales)

13:07.412 --> 13:08.913
(exhales)

13:10.248 --> 13:11.541
(sighs)

13:11.583 --> 13:13.668
(groans softly)

13:36.941 --> 13:39.027
* *

13:41.029 --> 13:43.365
(three echoing knocks)

13:43.406 --> 13:45.575
MAN (echoing):
Who asks for admission here?

13:45.617 --> 13:48.661
MAN 2:
A poor candidate
in a state of darkness.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.182
What is the predominant wish
of your heart?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.270
To see the light.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.153
Zachary?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.197
ZACH:
I solemnly promise

14:24.239 --> 14:27.200
and swear that I will
never reveal the secret arts

14:27.242 --> 14:28.618
and hidden mysteries belonging

14:28.660 --> 14:30.620
to Free and Accepted Masons.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.622
Should I knowingly violate
this oath,

14:32.664 --> 14:36.251
I expect no less penalty than
to have my throat cut across,

14:36.292 --> 14:38.378
my tongue torn out by its roots

14:38.420 --> 14:40.171
-No.
-and my body buried
in the rough...

14:40.213 --> 14:41.631
-No!
-(blood spatters)

14:42.632 --> 14:44.634
(faint gasping)

14:44.676 --> 14:45.677
Dad...

14:45.719 --> 14:47.220
(exhales)

14:48.388 --> 14:50.473
* *

15:07.532 --> 15:11.327
MAL'AKH (voice-over):
The secret is how to die.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.555
KATHERINE:
Tell me the words
as they come to you.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.726
Solomon.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.730
Amulet.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.067
Ring.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.653
Kings.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.782
Wise.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.785
Heart.

16:01.378 --> 16:03.129
Hey.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.715
Hey.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.550
How do you feel?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.386
Fine.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.389
You didn't make me do
anything embarrassing, like...

16:12.430 --> 16:14.391
bark like a dog or...

16:14.432 --> 16:15.558
rap?

16:15.600 --> 16:17.602
Close.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.784
"Lo, I have given thee
a wise and understanding heart."

16:33.576 --> 16:35.537
I-I need to see a Bible.

16:35.578 --> 16:36.746
(gasps) Careful.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.498
(indistinct chatter)

16:40.291 --> 16:41.793
(sighs)

16:46.673 --> 16:48.466
MAN:
Oh, excuse me.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.802
-Hmm?
-Would you mind watching
my stuff for a moment?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.679
-I have to...
-Oh, yeah, no problem.

16:52.721 --> 16:55.432
-Unless you're about to leave.
-No, it's fine.

16:55.473 --> 16:57.517
Um, I'm gonna be here
for a while.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.728
I was hoping you'd say that.

17:02.897 --> 17:05.316
-Thank you.
-Sure.

17:14.868 --> 17:19.330
Whoever altered the Bible text
replaced some of the words.

17:19.372 --> 17:23.960
In First Kings, God gave Solomon
a wise and understanding heart,

17:24.002 --> 17:27.005
making him
the legendary ruler of myth.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.841
But here
that script was changed.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.760
It no longer reads

17:31.801 --> 17:35.472
"wise and understanding heart."
It just reads "wisdom."

17:35.513 --> 17:37.849
So that's supposed to help you
unscramble the letters?

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
It's what's known
as a keyword cipher.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.603
It works like this. Here.

17:41.644 --> 17:43.688
You pull the letters of "wisdom"
out of the alphabet

17:43.730 --> 17:45.023
and place them at the beginning.

17:45.065 --> 17:47.275
The Hebrew transliteration
goes here,

17:47.317 --> 17:48.693
and then you translate.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.695
"I" becomes "B."

17:50.737 --> 17:52.447
"T" becomes "U."

17:52.489 --> 17:54.240
"P" is "R."

17:54.282 --> 17:55.992
(mumbling)

17:58.244 --> 17:59.996
"D."

18:05.335 --> 18:06.586
"D."

18:08.380 --> 18:11.007
KATHERINE:
"Buried... Ezra...

18:11.049 --> 18:12.384
Dove."

18:12.425 --> 18:14.052
Does that mean anything to you?

18:14.094 --> 18:17.472
-No.
-Sounds like a '90s grunge band.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.769
I know I haven't always been
the most supportive

18:22.811 --> 18:25.939
of you and your work,
but this was good.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.774
-It was...
-Science.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.360
I mean, like you said,
I had the...

18:30.402 --> 18:31.695
words all along...

18:31.736 --> 18:33.279
Quit while you're ahead.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.781
NUÑEZ:
So, big surprise,

18:34.823 --> 18:35.907
not a grunge band.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.284
Ezra Dove's a Freemason.

18:40.412 --> 18:41.996
LANGDON:
Ezra Dove.

18:42.038 --> 18:43.623
Died 1848.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.041
Buried at Oaken Hill...

18:45.083 --> 18:46.751
Cemetery.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.920
So maybe the capstone's buried
with him?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.340
(dogs barking in distance)

18:52.382 --> 18:53.967
(sighs)

18:58.805 --> 19:00.765
What's up, man? How you doing?

19:00.807 --> 19:02.475
You having fun?

19:02.517 --> 19:03.893
I'm sorry, what?

19:03.935 --> 19:06.730
Maybe instead of...
hanging outside my house,

19:06.771 --> 19:09.858
you should be out trying to find
the guy who shot up the Capitol?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.901
Killed one of your guys, man.

19:11.943 --> 19:13.778
Instead,
you're out here harassing me.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.447
-I'm not harassing you.
-Yes, you are.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.990
You're spying on me and my wife,

19:17.032 --> 19:18.700
and I'm making you
uncomfortable.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.119
I'm a cop, too. Yeah,
I fought for this country.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.580
I'm a victim here. Look at me.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.874
Check this out. Let me show you
something right here.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.917
It came through here
and here, okay?

19:27.959 --> 19:30.003
Now what that's called
is a through and through,

19:30.045 --> 19:32.756
and I got cream from the doctor.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.632
I can't get back there
sometimes. It's difficult.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.009
Maybe you could help me
rub it on.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.012
Maybe you
should go back inside, sir.

19:40.013 --> 19:41.681
Let me ask you a question.

19:41.723 --> 19:43.558
How do you go to the bathroom
in here, you know?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.478
Um, CIA give you
a special bottle or something?

19:48.104 --> 19:51.733
* *

20:04.954 --> 20:07.499
BLAKE:
He's keeping his vow of silence.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.584
TRISH:
He's Peter's good friend.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.920
If he knew where to find him,
don't you think he'd tell us?

20:11.961 --> 20:13.630
BLAKE:
No.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.508
I think that his group has
different priorities.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.510
You mean the Masons.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.012
A group within the Masons.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.681
Leviathan.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.016
Self-appointed guardians
of the wisdom.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.560
That is everything
that we know about them.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.691
I saw this symbol
in the Capitol basement.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.943
In the room Peter Solomon had
down there.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.197
This is why you had
his phone tapped.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.033
How long have you been looking
for this portal thing, exactly?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.993
Not long enough, apparently.

20:44.035 --> 20:46.037
Otherwise I'd have
more information than that.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.123
That's why
you're gonna go in there

20:48.164 --> 20:50.542
and you're gonna get more.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.544
With your keen eye
for pressure points

20:52.585 --> 20:55.046
and your mutual connections
to the Solomon offspring,

20:55.088 --> 20:57.966
I suspect that you're gonna
crack him without much trouble.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.594
So put aside regrets...

21:01.636 --> 21:03.930
and do what you do best.

21:09.060 --> 21:11.896
(loud, indistinct chatter)

21:11.938 --> 21:14.858
-(horn honks)
-I can't believe this.
It's bullshit.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.735
I don't understand
what you want from me.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.486
I was here the entire time.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.155
I didn't even know Ahmad
had left.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.574
(laughs):
None of this is my fault.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.994
From where I stand, I'm afraid
that's not entirely true.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.457
When you go on a three-day
bender with a Saudi prince

21:30.498 --> 21:32.751
and he drives his Ferrari
into a telephone pole,

21:32.792 --> 21:34.669
high on coke you provided,

21:34.711 --> 21:36.755
it doesn't really matter
where you were.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.590
Certainly not to his family.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.924
Where are you from?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.468
The embassy?

21:42.677 --> 21:45.055
I have an office there.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.973
-I'm here to help, Zach.
-Good.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.601
Then you can help me
get in touch with my dad.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.603
He has a lawyer
who can fix this.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.772
If he doesn't kill me first.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.232
What if there was a way
for you to take care of this

21:56.274 --> 21:57.650
without your father?

21:58.902 --> 22:00.612
You know...

22:02.572 --> 22:04.115
...help yourself.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.786
How?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.955
You made connections
that could be useful to us.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.708
Just means going
where I tell you for a bit

22:13.750 --> 22:15.627
and keeping a clean nose.

22:15.669 --> 22:16.961
Do that,

22:17.003 --> 22:18.963
and no one...

22:19.005 --> 22:23.593
including your father, needs
to know anything about this.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.933
It's kind of gotten to the point

22:29.974 --> 22:32.268
where I-I can't work
anywhere else.

22:32.310 --> 22:35.021
I guess I'm a bit superstitious.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.066
So, you're a writer?

22:38.108 --> 22:39.818
Guilty, yeah.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.945
Would I know
anything you've written?

22:41.986 --> 22:46.074
Well, if I told you my pen name,
you know, possibly.

22:46.116 --> 22:48.868
But I barely know you, so...

22:49.828 --> 22:51.705
I believe in superstition, too.

22:51.746 --> 22:52.914
Oh, you believe in superstition?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.791
Seriously,
there is a whole section

22:54.833 --> 22:57.043
-in my dissertation
dedicated to...
-Dissertation?

22:57.085 --> 22:59.129
-Oh, my God.
-In what field?

22:59.170 --> 23:01.715
Um, it's called noetic science.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.758
-Mm-hmm.
-I'm a research assistant,

23:03.800 --> 23:06.845
and we are looking for proof
of parapsychological phenomena.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.014
So that's
the mind-body connection,

23:09.055 --> 23:11.307
the whole spiritual healing
gamut.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.018
-Yeah.
-Are you serious?

23:13.059 --> 23:16.229
The book I'm writing
is all about parapsychology.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.857
-What?
-I swear to God.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.067
You-you wouldn't happen
to know Katharine Solomon

23:21.109 --> 23:22.902
by any chance, would you?

23:22.944 --> 23:23.987
Um...

23:24.029 --> 23:26.031
yes, actually-- she's my boss.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.157
-She's your boss?
-Yep.

23:27.198 --> 23:28.616
-Get out of town.
-(laughs)

23:28.658 --> 23:30.076
I saw her earlier today,
in fact.

23:30.118 --> 23:32.120
-You saw her today?
-(laughs): Yeah.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.830
Where?

23:37.125 --> 23:38.960
Oh, no, I... you know, I've just
read a lot of her work,

23:39.002 --> 23:41.046
-doing research
for my latest book.
-Right.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.007
She did this study
on indigo children.

23:44.049 --> 23:46.051
It was really fascinating.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.886
I assisted that study.

23:47.927 --> 23:50.138
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

23:51.097 --> 23:53.892
Could I buy you
another cup of coffee?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.603
-I mean, if you have time,
of course.
-Sure.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.730
Uh...

23:58.772 --> 24:01.274
how about a glass of wine
instead?

24:02.275 --> 24:05.070
-I'd love that. Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.738
-MAL'AKH: Oh, my...
-Oh!

24:06.780 --> 24:07.864
I cannot believe
I just did that.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.741
I'm... I am so sorry.

24:09.783 --> 24:11.284
Oh, it's nothing. I'll just...
I'm gonna go clean up quick.

24:11.326 --> 24:12.744
-I'll be right back.
-Needless to say,

24:12.786 --> 24:15.705
-the wine's on me.
-Okay. Deal.

24:37.852 --> 24:40.438
KATHERINE:
We're gonna need to find a map.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.857
This place is huge.
He could be buried anywhere.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.275
MAN:
Excuse me.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.736
Can I help you?

24:47.696 --> 24:49.906
Yes. We're looking
for someone.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.908
Someone... dead.

24:51.950 --> 24:53.159
Obviously.

24:53.201 --> 24:54.994
KATHERINE:
Our grandfather.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.831
We drove all the way
from Marblehead to see him.

24:57.872 --> 24:59.124
Right, Sean?

24:59.165 --> 25:02.377
Yes. I, Sean,
and, uh, my wonderful...

25:02.419 --> 25:04.170
Sister.

25:04.212 --> 25:08.174
...sister and I
w-would love to pay our respects

25:08.216 --> 25:10.677
to, um, Grandpa.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.263
It's still hard for him
to talk about it.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.931
Pain never leaves a person.

25:14.973 --> 25:17.308
It's why we build monuments
to it.

25:17.350 --> 25:20.061
If we didn't, you'd
be standing on a golf course.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.105
(chuckles):
Right.

25:22.147 --> 25:23.314
You'll find the directory
to the grounds

25:23.356 --> 25:25.900
off the path to the left.

25:25.942 --> 25:28.361
-Thank you. Thanks, Father.
-KATHERINE: Thanks.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.039
There he is. But hold on.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.041
-What?
-Uh, the code said "buried."

25:41.082 --> 25:44.210
This says he's in section Y09,
which is the columbarium.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.755
So he's not buried at all?

25:47.505 --> 25:49.049
No.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.899
* *

26:36.930 --> 26:39.891
(footsteps continue)

27:01.287 --> 27:03.289
What are you gonna do with that?

27:03.331 --> 27:06.084
I'm gonna push that button.

27:06.126 --> 27:09.045
Then you're gonna tell me
what I want to know.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.923
Your boss doesn't like getting
his hands dirty?

27:11.965 --> 27:13.967
So he leaves that to you?

27:14.009 --> 27:17.137
Essentially, yeah.

27:18.221 --> 27:21.016
But he and I don't always see
eye to eye.

27:24.519 --> 27:27.147
(low, rapid beeping)

27:27.188 --> 27:28.148
(beeping stops)

27:28.189 --> 27:31.234
(clicking)

27:33.945 --> 27:36.489
This is an A80
short-range EMP generator.

27:36.531 --> 27:38.992
I just shorted out the cameras.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.535
Pretty soon
they'll bring new ones,

27:40.577 --> 27:43.413
but whatever happens before then
is completely between us.

27:45.081 --> 27:48.084
Look, I don't care
about finding some portal.

27:48.126 --> 27:51.880
I just want to find
your friend Peter Solomon.

27:53.214 --> 27:57.427
CIA doesn't generally involve
itself in missing persons.

27:57.469 --> 28:00.096
I have a personal interest.

28:04.100 --> 28:08.104
His son Zachary was
one of our assets.

28:09.272 --> 28:11.941
I know because I recruited him.

28:13.902 --> 28:17.530
It was the first time I'd worked
with someone so young.

28:17.572 --> 28:19.491
And lost.

28:20.658 --> 28:23.203
I thought he could handle it.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.001
When he was thrown into prison
for trafficking,

28:30.043 --> 28:33.004
I was ordered to disavow
any knowledge of him.

28:33.046 --> 28:35.131
To burn him.

28:38.093 --> 28:40.178
So that's what I did.

28:41.596 --> 28:44.182
So what?

28:45.725 --> 28:49.270
You think finding Peter
will make everything all right?

28:51.064 --> 28:52.607
No.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.569
But it'd be a start.

29:00.240 --> 29:02.117
We're running out of time.

29:02.158 --> 29:05.704
Look, I don't know anything
about the man who took him.

29:05.745 --> 29:07.414
You know what he's after.

29:07.455 --> 29:10.500
If I understand that,
I can understand him,

29:10.542 --> 29:14.546
and that might be the difference
between Peter living and dying.

29:28.435 --> 29:30.311
Section Y.

29:33.398 --> 29:35.650
LANGDON:
There he is.

29:35.692 --> 29:38.486
-Make sure no one comes in.
-Whoa, whoa,

29:38.528 --> 29:40.739
-what are you doing?
-(chuckles): Don't worry,
I got it.

29:40.780 --> 29:44.409
Tight spaces are one thing;
heights I can handle.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.535
KATHERINE:
Why would somebody hide

29:45.577 --> 29:47.370
a capstone in an urn anyway?

29:47.412 --> 29:51.166
Many cultures have superstitions
about desecrating human remains.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.626
I don't believe in of them, of
course. But a strong deter...

29:53.668 --> 29:55.503
(both gasp)

29:58.256 --> 30:00.091
Nice catch.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.593
Saved us.

30:01.634 --> 30:04.054
And you want me to believe
you're not superstitious?

30:04.095 --> 30:06.765
I was worried about the noise.

30:06.806 --> 30:09.309
Well...

30:09.351 --> 30:11.561
prove it.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.156
We got a problem.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.200
There's nothing in here but ash.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.327
-(vehicle approaching)
-What?

30:32.290 --> 30:33.541
That's not our only problem.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.503
Someone knows we're here.

30:36.544 --> 30:38.672
-Who?
-Doesn't matter. We have to go.

30:38.713 --> 30:40.382
If someone's trying to stop us,
that means

30:40.423 --> 30:41.675
we're on the right track.

30:41.716 --> 30:44.094
The capstone
must be here somewhere.

30:47.138 --> 30:48.848
-What are you doing?
-Buying time.

30:48.890 --> 30:51.059
-(key clatters)
-Oh, my God.

30:51.101 --> 30:54.062
-Apologies again. I'm...
-Oh, my God. It's all good.

30:54.104 --> 30:56.272
-Thank you for the wine.
-Of course.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.444
To the mind-body connection.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.489
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

31:04.531 --> 31:06.366
(laughs softly)

31:14.124 --> 31:17.252
Well, I have
a confession to make.

31:17.293 --> 31:18.795
Hmm?

31:18.837 --> 31:23.591
I knew exactly who you were
when I sat down.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.471
(laughs):
I don't understand.

31:35.770 --> 31:37.814
Your finger...

31:42.277 --> 31:44.696
You should probably go now.

31:50.910 --> 31:52.662
(distorted, echoing exhale)

32:03.173 --> 32:05.258
(distorted, echoing voices)

32:18.355 --> 32:19.647
(distorted jingling of keys)

32:24.194 --> 32:27.322
(distorted, echoing breaths)

32:32.369 --> 32:34.329
(echoing):
Easy.

32:40.502 --> 32:42.587
* *

32:44.673 --> 32:46.341
(panting)

32:46.383 --> 32:48.426
There's got to be
something we're not seeing.

32:48.468 --> 32:51.930
Okay, um, buried, not buried.

32:51.971 --> 32:56.309
14 letters.
Wisdom. Kings. Heart.

32:56.351 --> 32:59.229
He's almost here,
and you locked us in!

32:59.270 --> 33:00.438
Yeah. Yeah.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.565
Yeah.

33:04.651 --> 33:05.944
Jonah.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.362
Langdon.

33:07.404 --> 33:09.197
Buried Dove.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.409
(door rattling)

33:14.452 --> 33:16.204
Langdon.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.959
In Hebrew, Jonah means "dove."

33:23.211 --> 33:24.421
Langdon!

33:25.380 --> 33:27.257
Come on!

33:28.341 --> 33:30.468
These reliefs tell the story
of Jonah and the Whale.

33:30.510 --> 33:32.470
-Get down!
-And what's another word
for "whale"?

33:32.512 --> 33:34.472
Leviathan.

33:34.514 --> 33:36.725
-(Langdon coughing)
-Look.

33:40.228 --> 33:42.313
(coughing):
There's something in here.

33:42.355 --> 33:44.899
-Oh. Oh, my God.
-(Katherine strains)

33:44.941 --> 33:46.609
Wait. Wait.

33:48.361 --> 33:49.863
(Katherine gasps, coughs)

33:49.904 --> 33:50.947
It's here.

33:54.909 --> 33:57.412
-It's not the capstone.
-Just take it and keep going.

33:57.454 --> 34:00.498
(both coughing)

34:02.625 --> 34:04.461
(gasping breaths)

34:04.502 --> 34:05.879
(coughing)

34:07.547 --> 34:09.591
(panting):
Here.

34:14.387 --> 34:15.472
No!

34:15.513 --> 34:17.599
(thuds, creaks)

34:21.936 --> 34:23.563
(Katherine strains,
coughs loudly)

34:23.605 --> 34:25.774
How did Jonah get out again?

34:25.815 --> 34:28.693
(panting):
God commanded it.

34:28.735 --> 34:31.738
Well, now would be a good time.

34:31.780 --> 34:32.906
(grunts loudly)

34:36.618 --> 34:38.703
* *

34:45.627 --> 34:47.003
(engine starts)

34:47.045 --> 34:49.005
(tires squeal)

34:58.515 --> 35:00.558
(insects trilling)

35:04.688 --> 35:06.815
(dialing)

35:07.816 --> 35:09.484
-(line ringing)
-(sighs)

35:09.526 --> 35:10.944
Hey, hey, Lace.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.570
What's up, man?

35:12.612 --> 35:14.823
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry. It's late.

35:14.864 --> 35:16.574
Yeah, yeah, no, all good.

35:16.616 --> 35:17.951
Yeah, I got out today.

35:17.992 --> 35:20.537
So, listen, um...

35:20.578 --> 35:23.832
you, uh,
you got anything on the shooter?

35:24.916 --> 35:27.919
Yeah, yeah, I know, the CIA got
some "eyes only" bullshit,

35:27.961 --> 35:31.006
but... we got him on camera,
right?

35:31.047 --> 35:35.010
So run him through Clearview,
get me a name.

35:35.051 --> 35:36.928
Yeah, tomorrow works fine.

35:36.970 --> 35:39.556
Thanks, man. I owe you one.

35:40.557 --> 35:41.850
(chuckles)
All right, man,

35:41.891 --> 35:43.184
go back to watching bowling
or whatever.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.644
(car engine starts)

35:44.686 --> 35:46.062
All right.

35:55.739 --> 35:57.115
(radio static)

35:57.157 --> 35:58.908
WOMAN (over scanner):
...all units in vicinity,

35:58.950 --> 36:00.785
Code 1, Adams Memorial.

36:00.827 --> 36:04.456
Nonresponsive female,
yet to be identified.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.875
Black and red SUV
found at scene.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.626
-Huh.
-Maryland license
plate number...

36:08.668 --> 36:09.836
(clicks off scanner)

36:14.924 --> 36:16.634
Peter...

36:16.676 --> 36:19.554
brought me
into the Leviathan Group.

36:19.596 --> 36:23.892
He was the one who revealed
its purpose.

36:23.933 --> 36:28.772
All Masons tell stories
about deeply held secrets.

36:28.813 --> 36:33.193
Most of them are tall tales
to intrigue new members.

36:34.152 --> 36:35.987
But this was different.

36:39.115 --> 36:41.201
(voice-over):
I saw in these men

36:41.242 --> 36:44.079
a belief...

36:44.120 --> 36:48.750
in something beyond possibility.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.710
A belief

36:50.752 --> 36:54.047
that the ancient wisdom
was not only real,

36:54.089 --> 36:57.467
but that it could
unlock consciousness,

36:57.509 --> 36:58.968
allowing man to access

36:59.010 --> 37:02.639
hidden reservoirs of power.

37:03.932 --> 37:06.559
The group was formed

37:06.601 --> 37:08.603
based on two questions:

37:08.645 --> 37:12.774
Could humanity handle
such an evolution?

37:12.816 --> 37:14.943
And what might happen

37:14.984 --> 37:18.655
if this power fell
into the wrong hands?

37:24.994 --> 37:27.288
(voice-over):
We made a pact

37:27.330 --> 37:30.625
to safeguard the clues.

37:33.962 --> 37:36.840
But the lure of the myth
was strong.

37:37.924 --> 37:40.010
* *

37:46.808 --> 37:48.977
There's a story

37:49.019 --> 37:52.147
of a member of the group

37:52.188 --> 37:54.149
from the beginning
of the last century

37:54.190 --> 37:57.569
for whom the lure was too great.

38:01.239 --> 38:03.241
He abandoned his oath.

38:03.283 --> 38:06.036
He sought the wisdom
for himself.

38:07.662 --> 38:08.997
And he found it.

38:10.707 --> 38:14.210
It is said that he learned
to control things,

38:14.252 --> 38:18.256
that he could bend
matter to his will.

38:18.298 --> 38:21.551
* *

38:47.243 --> 38:49.245
(gasps) Oh, God.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.753
(turns off projector)

39:02.175 --> 39:04.719
(takes deep breath)

39:24.280 --> 39:27.325
I did an EMP gambit
in Frankfurt in '09.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.744
I didn't have one of these.

39:29.786 --> 39:32.163
I'd use a garage door opener.

39:32.205 --> 39:34.791
(soft chuckle)

39:34.833 --> 39:37.335
SATO:
What do you want to do with him?

39:38.670 --> 39:40.714
BLAKE:
Cut him loose.

39:40.755 --> 39:43.383
Now that you've bonded,
you can use him as needed.

39:50.015 --> 39:51.933
(Langdon sighs)

39:56.396 --> 39:58.106
(phone buzzes)

40:00.316 --> 40:02.736
(sighs)

40:03.695 --> 40:05.655
Is it him?

40:08.324 --> 40:10.785
It's a quote from the Apocrypha.

40:12.203 --> 40:15.040
Fourth Book of the Maccabees.

40:18.418 --> 40:21.254
(voice-over):
"For if you dispose me to anger

40:21.296 --> 40:24.883
"by your disobedience...

40:24.924 --> 40:28.928
"you will compel me,
with dreadful punishments...

40:31.264 --> 40:34.392
"...to destroy

40:34.434 --> 40:36.811
every one of you."

40:36.853 --> 40:38.897
* *

41:02.379 --> 41:04.464
* *

41:34.452 --> 41:36.746
* *

42:06.526 --> 42:06.651
* *
