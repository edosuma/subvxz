[Shadowsan] Somewhere in my coat
lies a single dollar bill.

The coat has many pockets.

So, how come failing Shadowsan's final

03:07.979 --> 03:09.480
[sighs] I don't know.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.484
Maybe because I never got to see
where the dollar was hiding

03:13.568 --> 03:14.819
when the exam was over.

03:18.281 --> 03:22.076
I was the best pickpocket in Stealth 101,
way better than Tigress.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.871
Guess I just feel like
I still have something to prove.

03:26.497 --> 03:27.957

Pea soup.

[keyboard clicking]

03:31.419 --> 03:34.839
[Player] They don't call San Francisco,
California, "Fog City" for nothing.

03:35.590 --> 03:39.135
<i>The fog blows in so often</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:42.722
[Carmen] <i>But when the fog lifts,</i>

03:42.805 --> 03:46.851
<i>The Golden Gate Bridge</i>

03:46.935 --> 03:50.521

03:50.897 --> 03:53.191

<i>Chinatown in America,</i>

03:53.274 --> 03:57.695

[Player] <i>Too bad it hasn't been used</i>
<i>to jail criminals since 1963.</i>

04:01.449 --> 04:03.451
<i>Since VILE</i>

04:03.618 --> 04:05.662
it would've been the perfect place
to lock them up.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.539
Until that day comes,
I'm happy to keep stealing their money

04:08.623 --> 04:10.583

04:10.667 --> 04:13.544
like the Children's Foundation

04:13.711 --> 04:16.965
A foggy night seems like
perfect trench coat weather.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.759

04:40.363 --> 04:42.323
[auctioneer] Ladies and gentlemen,
this next item

04:42.407 --> 04:44.659
is what you've been waiting
all evening for:

04:44.867 --> 04:49.914
an extremely rare postage stamp,
donated by an anonymous private collector.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.418
"The One-Cent Black on Magenta."

04:53.501 --> 04:55.962
[chuckles] We can use it
to send a postcard to VILE.

04:56.254 --> 05:00.550
Whoa. It's actually really valuable,
to the tune of a cool ten million.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.844
Cents. Very funny, Player.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.054
<i>No, seriously, dollars.</i>

05:05.430 --> 05:08.308
How is a one-cent stamp
worth ten million dollars?

05:08.683 --> 05:11.811
[Player] Only a small number of these
black on magentas were ever printed,

05:11.894 --> 05:13.938
and this is the only one known to survive.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.690
I'm taking up stamp collecting.

05:15.898 --> 05:19.152
Great, I'll win it for you.
VILE can afford it.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.364

go to the Children's Foundation,

If one wishes to vanish

06:01.069 --> 06:03.112

Gah!

06:07.283 --> 06:08.785
[high heels clacking]

Yes. I am here and you are there,
Ms. Argent.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.015
But where on Earth is Carmen Sandiego?

06:34.685 --> 06:39.148
Stealing from a children's charity
makes very little sense for Ms. Sandiego,

06:39.232 --> 06:41.567
especially following the events in Mumbai

06:41.651 --> 06:43.778
when she left the stolen Magna Carta
for us to find.

06:43.861 --> 06:44.987
Mip, mip, mip!

06:49.617 --> 06:50.451
Aha!

06:51.744 --> 06:52.578
Ah!

06:54.789 --> 06:55.998
Go on, get out of here!

07:00.169 --> 07:02.964
-You let him go?
-What? He was merely a street clown.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.090
At city hall?

07:04.465 --> 07:08.761
Such performers are typically relegated
to tourist areas, like Fisherman's Wharf.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.556
Please remain on task, Agent Argent.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.684
Once again,
Carmen Sandiego has slipped away.

07:15.017 --> 07:19.355
<i>This time, with a ten-million-dollar stamp</i>
<i>in her little red hands.</i>

07:29.282 --> 07:32.034
[Maelstrom] Carmen Sandiego.
I see.

07:32.326 --> 07:33.870
Stand by, Mime Bomb.

07:33.953 --> 07:36.747
We will contact you with instructions
on how to proceed.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.130
If our former pride and joy
is on our snitch's trail,

07:44.380 --> 07:47.216
I would suggest
that a more suitable operative

07:47.300 --> 07:49.844
transport the stamp out of San Francisco.

07:50.219 --> 07:53.806
Mime Bomb's not exactly
what I would call the strong silent type.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.517
I would recommend Tigress.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.980
Would this be because she failed
to stop Carmen Sandiego in Indonesia?

08:01.063 --> 08:04.984
Tigress is my finest student
and the most vicious.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.861
You do not wish me to send her

08:06.944 --> 08:09.906
because you continue to be soft
on Black Sheep.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.995
Do I need to remind you
that we were all soft on Black Sheep

08:16.078 --> 08:18.372
before she betrayed us
and took a new name?

08:18.664 --> 08:22.084
Do I need to remind you
that I never thought she was fit

08:22.168 --> 08:25.379
to enroll in VILE's program
to begin with?

08:25.546 --> 08:29.926
Faculty, please, why squabble
when we can simply vote?

08:30.384 --> 08:33.846
All in favor of sending Tigress,
raise your hand.

Dr. Bellum, your participation
is mandatory for us to reach a decision.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.483
I happen to be preoccupied
at the moment, Professor.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.818
You do want me to hack into this keycard

08:47.902 --> 08:50.530
and learn what I can about ACME,
don't you?

08:52.573 --> 08:54.116
Fine, fine, send whomever.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.828
I shall notify Tigress.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.797

Your intel is impeccable, Player.

09:31.529 --> 09:35.366
Mime Bomb's here, hiding in plain sight
behind an invisible newspaper.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.410
-[Player] <i>Think he has the stamp?</i>

09:37.493 --> 09:39.287
He could be receiving or delivering.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.211
It's in the cat.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.555
I'll take the tchotchke.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.725
Or what? You'll claw my coat
into a bolero jacket?

10:43.142 --> 10:47.063
I didn't just ace that exam,
I shredded it,

10:47.271 --> 10:50.358
which is what
I'm about to do to your face.

Finders keepers.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.384

11:27.436 --> 11:29.063
[growls] Unlucky cat!

11:31.607 --> 11:32.441
Empty?

11:33.359 --> 11:34.610
Mime Bomb.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.158
ACME intel indicates

11:41.242 --> 11:44.412
there will be an exchange
of an unknown commodity here tonight.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.330
It could be the stolen stamp.

11:46.414 --> 11:50.543
Then perhaps today we shall catch
Carmen Sandiego red-handed.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.464
Do you find that suspicious?

11:55.923 --> 11:57.716
Another street clown.
So what?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.718
San Francisco is filled with them.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.929
I think it's the same one from last night.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.392
You there!

12:07.101 --> 12:08.102
[Devineaux] Stop!

12:09.103 --> 12:09.979
[thuds]

12:12.898 --> 12:14.984
Devineaux had better be good at charades.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.450
[Julia] Perhaps you left your keycard
in another jacket.

12:22.783 --> 12:24.994
I always wear my lucky coat
when I am working,

12:25.077 --> 12:27.079
and I only have one lucky coat.

12:27.163 --> 12:31.250
Sir, were you wearing this coat
when you drove into the Swiss lake?

12:31.333 --> 12:33.461
Or when you fell
onto the windshield of your c--

12:33.544 --> 12:34.712
Never mind that!

12:35.504 --> 12:38.340
Please just use your keycard, Ms. Argent.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.302
[beeping]

12:49.351 --> 12:51.729
What is your connection
to Carmen Sandiego, hmm?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.941
Speak up! You do not have the right
to remain silent!

12:58.611 --> 13:01.780
Perhaps we need to allow him
to answer in his own way.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.240
[groans] Go on.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.122
Three words, first syllable.

13:10.915 --> 13:11.790
An elephant?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.375
Getting a pedicure?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.336
Giving you a pedicure?

13:15.920 --> 13:18.506
While spreading cheese, on a baguette?

13:18.839 --> 13:20.049
On Bastille Day?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.386
This is ridiculous! What is he saying?

13:24.803 --> 13:27.264
He insists he was merely performing
on the street.

13:27.348 --> 13:29.517
He has never heard of any Carmen Sandiego.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.768
He says he is innocent.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.063
[growls] You are not innocent!

13:34.146 --> 13:36.732
Carmen Sandiego stole the stamp
and you are her courier!

13:37.858 --> 13:40.569
You are carrying the stamp, admit it!
Give it to me!

13:40.778 --> 13:42.571
[grunting]

13:44.406 --> 13:46.367
Perhaps he is working for VILE.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.166
Our sincerest apologies.
You are free to go.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.460
Uh, tell no one about this, please.

13:58.420 --> 14:03.092
Sir, an innocent mime does not evade
agents he encounters on the street.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.637
Which is precisely why I let him go,
Ms. Argent.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.224
I guarantee you that he will lead us
straight to Carmen Sandiego.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.476
[beeping]

14:20.192 --> 14:21.402
Where have you been?

14:25.364 --> 14:27.950
There, a street clown performing
at Fisherman's Wharf.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.118
Are you happy now?

14:29.827 --> 14:32.329
You're being followed.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.750
Bravo, Mime!
