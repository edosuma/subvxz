WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:04.935
I'm definitely putting
Middlebury on my list.

00:04.936 --> 00:07.237
Vermont is really cold in the winter.

00:07.238 --> 00:09.322
Which is why I also have UCLA on here.

00:09.323 --> 00:10.356
Hollywood, baby.

00:10.357 --> 00:11.658
For the first of,

00:11.659 --> 00:14.828
I'm sure many times over
the next couple of years,

00:14.829 --> 00:18.915
I have to ask, what is wrong with UVA?

00:18.916 --> 00:20.500
Yeah, you are a legacy... twice.

00:20.501 --> 00:23.670
Yeah, I got my degree and
met the love of my life.

00:23.671 --> 00:26.213
- See? Greatest twofer ever.
- Mm-hmm.

00:26.214 --> 00:27.625
You should consider Georgetown.

00:27.626 --> 00:28.733
I'm really happy there.

00:28.734 --> 00:30.376
Okay, thank you, McCords,

00:30.377 --> 00:33.129
but I would like to go out of
state and blaze a new trail.

00:33.130 --> 00:35.521
I know, but do you have to blaze

00:35.522 --> 00:37.133
all the way to California?

00:37.134 --> 00:38.768
Yeah. Hey, Jason,

00:38.769 --> 00:39.803
you'll consider UVA, right?

00:39.804 --> 00:41.438
We need another Wahoo in the family.

00:42.807 --> 00:45.308
Okay, the nickname itself is
reason to cross it off the list.

00:45.309 --> 00:46.860
I'm not going to college, so...

00:46.861 --> 00:49.795
And may I ask why?

00:50.815 --> 00:54.150
Academia's a shell game
that only rich kids can win.

00:54.151 --> 00:55.985
It's a student debt factory

00:55.986 --> 00:57.654
that imparts no real wisdom or skills.

00:57.655 --> 00:58.571
It's a racket.

00:58.572 --> 01:00.623
That's what I thought, too,

01:00.624 --> 01:02.792
until I actually got out in the real world.

01:02.793 --> 01:05.078
We already have a college
fund all set aside.

01:05.078 --> 01:08.164
College expenses will
outpace anything you've saved.

01:08.165 --> 01:09.883
Do you really want to
mortgage your retirement

01:09.884 --> 01:12.502
so I can extend my childhood for four years

01:12.503 --> 01:14.754
going to keggers and pledging a frat?

01:14.755 --> 01:16.339
- Now, that's a good point.
- When you put it that way.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.675
- How much is in the college fund?
- A lot.

01:18.676 --> 01:20.093
- Enough so that we could sail
around the world? - Heck yeah.

01:20.094 --> 01:21.427
Because I've always wanted
to see the Galapagos Islands.

01:21.428 --> 01:22.562
Yeah, heck, we could go on...

01:22.563 --> 01:23.813
- You're making fun of me.
- A little bit.

01:23.814 --> 01:25.148
You know what? I don't have to

01:25.149 --> 01:26.266
take advice from you, Professor.

01:26.267 --> 01:29.352
First, you were a puppet for big business,

01:29.353 --> 01:32.355
and now you're working for the
military-industrial complex.

01:32.356 --> 01:34.089
How's that for a twofer?

01:37.745 --> 01:39.946
Well, on the upside, if
he does change his mind,

01:39.947 --> 01:42.965
I think he's landed on a great
topic for his application essay.

01:46.514 --> 01:47.728
Oh, don't tell me.

01:47.729 --> 01:49.756
Is that the famous East
Africa corruption report?

01:49.757 --> 01:50.790
The one and only.

01:50.791 --> 01:51.758
It's finally finished?

01:51.759 --> 01:53.126
Well, it's finally printed out.

01:53.127 --> 01:57.046
454 pages of raw excitement.

01:57.047 --> 01:58.515
We've run the most recent changes

01:58.516 --> 02:00.884
by Treasury, Commerce and the CIA.

02:00.885 --> 02:03.720
All that's left is for the
White House to sign off.

02:03.721 --> 02:05.271
You know, these interdepartmental

02:05.272 --> 02:07.273
task forces seem like a good idea,

02:07.274 --> 02:09.142
until you realize how many people

02:09.143 --> 02:11.895
need to approve of it
before you're finished.

02:11.896 --> 02:13.146
Oh, I ordered pizza

02:13.147 --> 02:15.064
from Romano's last night,

02:15.065 --> 02:17.829
the delivery guy is
concerned about our reliance

02:17.830 --> 02:19.869
on anti-corruption agencies.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.455
I have concerns about their
crust being too doughy.

02:22.456 --> 02:25.208
Does this report have a title yet?

02:25.209 --> 02:27.827
"Corruption in East Africa
and its Negative Impact

02:27.828 --> 02:30.163
on U.S. Competitive
Advantage in the Region."

02:30.164 --> 02:31.748
That's catchy.

02:31.749 --> 02:35.218
See, I wanted, "China Wins
Because They Bribe Everyone,"

02:35.219 --> 02:36.920
but Treasury shot me down.

02:36.921 --> 02:39.923
Ma'am. I have Henry on the phone.

02:39.924 --> 02:41.641
He says it's about his father.

02:41.642 --> 02:43.760
It's important.

02:43.761 --> 02:45.494
Okay, thank you.

02:49.433 --> 02:53.368
Baby, I'm so sorry.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.155
What happened?

02:56.156 --> 03:00.076
I mean, the last time we
saw him, he-he seemed fine.

03:00.077 --> 03:01.578
Maureen found him this morning.

03:01.579 --> 03:04.614
At first she thought he just overslept.

03:04.615 --> 03:06.616
He must have died during the night.

03:06.617 --> 03:08.952
Probably a heart attack.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.672
He always said he wanted
to die in his sleep...

03:12.673 --> 03:14.207
quick and painless.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.459
Yeah, but not yet.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.628
He was too young.

03:18.629 --> 03:20.680
He called me about a week ago.

03:20.681 --> 03:22.215
Just to catch up.

03:22.216 --> 03:25.400
Had a nice long talk.

03:28.973 --> 03:30.822
I'm grateful for that.

03:32.000 --> 03:38.074

03:57.801 --> 03:59.085
Oh, look at you.

03:59.086 --> 04:00.637
Come here.

04:00.638 --> 04:02.771
Hey, Aunt Maureen.

04:04.341 --> 04:05.975
Good to see you, Elizabeth.

04:05.976 --> 04:07.010
Maureen, nice to see you.

04:07.011 --> 04:08.928
- I'm so sorry about Patrick.
- Thanks.

04:08.929 --> 04:10.346
Ah, it's been a rough morning,

04:10.347 --> 04:13.349
but you're a bright spot in a terrible day.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.500
Oh.

04:16.403 --> 04:17.904
Three SUVs, huh?

04:17.904 --> 04:19.522
I'll have to tell the mourners

04:19.523 --> 04:21.024
that parking is at a premium.

04:21.024 --> 04:23.109
Security protocol.

04:23.110 --> 04:25.460
You know, in case someone
wants to shoot her.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.915
Come on, kids, help me out, would you?

04:28.916 --> 04:31.284
Thanks, kid. Good to see you.

04:31.285 --> 04:33.301
All right.

04:34.038 --> 04:35.538
Can I get anybody anything?

04:35.539 --> 04:37.540
Oh, we're good, thanks.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.175
Kids, I can make sandwiches.

04:39.176 --> 04:41.210
We actually ate on the road.

04:41.211 --> 04:42.962
Maureen, will you come and sit down?

04:42.963 --> 04:44.729
You're just making everybody nervous.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.383
Dad, can we go watch TV?

04:47.384 --> 04:48.718
- Sure thing.
- No.

04:48.719 --> 04:49.719
Please?

04:49.720 --> 04:50.720
It's family time.

04:50.721 --> 04:52.821
They can be a family in the den.

04:57.611 --> 05:00.196
Erin, if you finally decide
to have kids of your own,

05:00.197 --> 05:01.564
you may find there's more to it

05:01.565 --> 05:03.316
than giving in to them all the time.

05:03.317 --> 05:05.318
I teach history to high schoolers.

05:05.319 --> 05:07.904
I'm an expert in knowing when
a teenager needs to get up

05:07.905 --> 05:09.655
and get the heck out of the room.

05:09.656 --> 05:10.573
Okay, go.

05:10.574 --> 05:11.708
Go, you guys. Go ahead.

05:11.709 --> 05:13.076
Um, I think I'm gonna take a walk.

05:13.077 --> 05:14.577
I'll come with you.

05:14.578 --> 05:16.579
Dad, I'll see you back at your place.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.580
Later.

05:17.581 --> 05:20.049
Well, now the grown-ups can talk freely.

05:20.050 --> 05:21.384
Henry and Elizabeth

05:21.385 --> 05:23.002
haven't heard your news.

05:23.003 --> 05:26.556
Oh, yeah. Um, me and Stacy are separated.

05:26.557 --> 05:29.008
Oh, gosh, Shane, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:29.009 --> 05:30.176
I really liked her.

05:30.177 --> 05:32.595
Me, too. We just jumped in too fast.

05:32.596 --> 05:33.763
Oh, that's what happens

05:33.764 --> 05:35.181
when you get married before the ink

05:35.182 --> 05:36.948
on your last divorce is even dry.

05:40.738 --> 05:43.156
Wait, who's this? I don't recognize her.

05:43.157 --> 05:45.742
That's Debra, Dad's new girlfriend.

05:45.743 --> 05:48.911
Wow. On the mantel. It must be serious.

05:48.912 --> 05:50.246
Oh, I wouldn't know.

05:50.247 --> 05:52.915
I didn't like to talk to
him about his lady friends.

05:52.916 --> 05:54.417
Not with Mom so recently gone.

05:54.418 --> 05:56.419
Maureen, Mom's been dead for four years.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.121
Well, I still feel her
presence in this house.

05:58.122 --> 06:00.757
Now they're together in heaven.

06:00.758 --> 06:03.009
Want to bet the old man's up there

06:03.010 --> 06:05.044
giving St. Peter a piece of his mind?

06:05.045 --> 06:07.380
Demanding better
conditions and overtime pay

06:07.381 --> 06:09.132
for those hardworking angels.

06:10.384 --> 06:12.802
Well, maybe we should try
and get in touch with her.

06:12.803 --> 06:14.470
Well, if by we, you mean me,

06:14.471 --> 06:16.439
I have got enough on my plate, thank you.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.474
Maureen, Henry and I can definitely help.

06:18.475 --> 06:19.642
What do you need?

06:19.643 --> 06:20.810
Um...

06:20.811 --> 06:22.979
there's the obituary to write,

06:22.980 --> 06:24.697
and, uh, I have an appointment tomorrow

06:24.698 --> 06:26.783
at O'Flynn and Sons to
prepare for the service.

06:26.784 --> 06:27.950
I can go with you to that.

06:27.951 --> 06:30.036
Somebody needs to go to the precinct today

06:30.037 --> 06:31.070
to sign the paperwork.

06:31.071 --> 06:32.238
I can take care of that.

06:32.239 --> 06:34.490
Oh, it's Detective Michael Swanstrom.

06:34.491 --> 06:35.958
He was here this morning.

06:35.959 --> 06:37.293
He knew Dad from church.

06:37.294 --> 06:39.045
Of course, Dad hadn't been in a while.

06:39.046 --> 06:40.329
He only went to make Mom happy.

06:41.331 --> 06:43.082
So, do you want me to pick up dinner?

06:43.083 --> 06:45.551
God, no. People are already
dropping off casseroles.

06:45.552 --> 06:47.170
We'll have more food than
we know what to do with.

06:47.171 --> 06:49.164
I'll help you clean out the
fridge, make some more room.

06:49.165 --> 06:51.174
- Oh, Elizabeth, would you do me a favor?
- Sure.

06:51.175 --> 06:53.843
Could you get Dad's navy
blue suit out of his room?

06:53.844 --> 06:55.845
I... just can't go in there.

06:55.846 --> 06:57.779
Of course.

06:58.682 --> 07:01.017
It's weird,

07:01.018 --> 07:03.868
all of us being here without him.

07:13.197 --> 07:15.781
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mr. McCord.

07:15.782 --> 07:17.215
Thank you.

07:21.171 --> 07:24.290
I have some information about your father.

07:24.291 --> 07:26.792
About the way he died.

07:26.793 --> 07:28.878
Wasn't it a heart attack?

07:28.879 --> 07:32.048
Um... based on evidence
I found at the house,

07:32.049 --> 07:34.316
I asked the M.E. to
run a toxicology screen.

07:36.937 --> 07:40.273
Your father died of a barbiturate overdose.

07:40.274 --> 07:42.608
What?

07:42.609 --> 07:44.395
He didn't take drugs.

07:45.112 --> 07:46.529
There was an empty prescription bottle

07:46.530 --> 07:49.464
of hydrocodone in the bathroom trash can.

07:50.234 --> 07:51.734
Hydrocodone is a painkiller.

07:51.735 --> 07:54.419
Yeah, for when his knee acted up.

07:55.072 --> 07:57.839
He refilled it yesterday morning.

08:02.329 --> 08:04.679
Are you saying he took all of them?

08:07.251 --> 08:10.002
Isn't there another explanation?

08:10.003 --> 08:12.103
I'm afraid not.

08:12.839 --> 08:14.939
Your father's death was a suicide.

08:18.095 --> 08:25.640
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

08:32.457 --> 08:35.106
I saw him every day. I
mean, he was never down.

08:35.107 --> 08:36.607
Never. He was just himself.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.443
Daddy'd never let on how
he was really feeling.

08:38.443 --> 08:40.660
That just wasn't his way.

08:40.662 --> 08:43.081
That's true. Even when he was
forced off the union board,

08:43.082 --> 08:45.700
it took him years to tell us about it.

08:45.701 --> 08:47.585
That... that broke his spirit.

08:47.586 --> 08:49.037
Maybe he was sick?

08:49.038 --> 08:50.455
I called Dr. Peterson.

08:50.456 --> 08:52.707
Other than the heart condition,
he was in good health.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.292
They made a mistake.

08:54.293 --> 08:57.295
Our dad would never do
this. It is a mortal sin.

08:57.296 --> 08:59.130
Maureen, it's the 21st century.

08:59.131 --> 09:00.465
Everybody knows about depression

09:00.466 --> 09:02.212
and what it can do to you,
even the Catholic Church.

09:02.213 --> 09:03.442
I'm sure Father Benedict...

09:03.443 --> 09:05.112
You will not tell Father
Benedict about this.

09:05.113 --> 09:07.455
No one outside this family is
to know anything about this.

09:07.456 --> 09:08.585
- You're being unreasonable.
- Am I?

09:08.586 --> 09:10.267
Forget about our friends
and family for a second.

09:10.268 --> 09:13.277
Dad was the father-in-law
to the Secretary of State.

09:13.278 --> 09:15.813
I mean, do you want all our
business all over the tabloids?

09:15.814 --> 09:17.398
Oh, no, I-I don't think that they would...

09:17.399 --> 09:18.900
What, it's not important enough

09:18.901 --> 09:20.451
to make the news? Oh...

09:20.452 --> 09:22.036
Forget it. Tom, let's go.

09:22.037 --> 09:23.488
I... Where are the kids? Geez.

09:23.489 --> 09:25.755
Walked home an hour ago.

09:26.492 --> 09:27.658
Good night, Tom.

09:27.659 --> 09:28.925
Night.

09:29.661 --> 09:31.329
I'm glad you're here.

09:31.330 --> 09:34.048
Someone has to put her in her
place every once in a while.

09:34.049 --> 09:35.083
We're all in shock.

09:36.752 --> 09:38.169
See you tomorrow, okay?

09:38.170 --> 09:39.420
Yeah, we'll be here.

09:39.421 --> 09:40.471
All right.

09:40.472 --> 09:41.556
Good night.

09:41.557 --> 09:43.508
Night.

09:49.598 --> 09:51.516
Sorry about Maureen.

09:51.517 --> 09:54.185
Babe, the first time you brought
me home to meet your family,

09:54.186 --> 09:56.988
you said, "I'm sorry about Maureen."

09:57.940 --> 10:00.024
Let's just take that as a given.

10:00.025 --> 10:02.743
She's just like my dad... no filter.

10:02.744 --> 10:06.531
Well, speaking your mind
is a McCord family trait

10:06.532 --> 10:08.181
that you all share.

10:08.867 --> 10:11.669
And our kids have inherited.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.371
How are they doing?

10:13.372 --> 10:16.007
Processing, like the rest of us.

10:16.008 --> 10:18.042
Except Maureen; she's firmly ensconced

10:18.043 --> 10:19.377
on her sofa of denial.

10:19.378 --> 10:20.711
Henry,

10:20.712 --> 10:22.263
her world has been rocked.

10:22.264 --> 10:24.981
They all need to lean on you a little.

10:25.717 --> 10:28.118
Check on the kids.

10:35.444 --> 10:37.111
I say again,

10:37.112 --> 10:39.113
what wrong with a fruit basket?

10:39.114 --> 10:40.537
No one wants fruit, ever.

10:40.538 --> 10:42.632
Arrange for bagels, lox,
cream cheese, the works,

10:42.633 --> 10:44.536
to be delivered for breakfast tomorrow.

10:44.537 --> 10:46.504
When we find out what Mr. McCord died from,

10:46.505 --> 10:48.418
we'll send a donation in remembrance.

10:48.419 --> 10:49.966
The best thing we can do right now

10:50.576 --> 10:52.353
is keep things running smoothly here

10:52.354 --> 10:54.912
so the Secretary has all
the time and energy she needs

10:54.913 --> 10:56.396
to take care of her family.

10:57.016 --> 10:58.749
Good evening, team.

10:59.435 --> 11:01.486
Are we your team?

11:01.487 --> 11:02.437
Well, you are now.

11:02.438 --> 11:04.155
I need you to get to work right away

11:04.156 --> 11:05.824
on a new interagency task force.

11:05.825 --> 11:07.909
We're not quite finished with the last one.

11:07.910 --> 11:08.788
Have you read

11:08.789 --> 11:10.161
the Africa report, by the way?

11:10.162 --> 11:11.196
I haven't had the time.

11:11.197 --> 11:12.947
I spent the day learning

11:12.948 --> 11:15.750
about invasive aquatic species.

11:15.751 --> 11:17.368
What are invasive aquatic...

11:17.369 --> 11:20.191
Little buggers coming
over from Asia and Europe,

11:20.192 --> 11:23.274
overrunning the North
American oceanic ecosystem.

11:23.275 --> 11:25.026
What do you mean, like squid?

11:25.027 --> 11:27.111
Are you mocking me, son?

11:27.112 --> 11:30.114
No, I would, I would never mock.

11:30.115 --> 11:32.986
You think terrorism is the only threat

11:32.987 --> 11:35.286
to our American way of life?

11:35.287 --> 11:38.956
Wait till the Australian mollusk
arrives and sets up house.

11:38.957 --> 11:41.516
With no natural predators,
all the river mouths

11:41.517 --> 11:44.937
in the Gulf of Mexico
will be completely clogged.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.989
Or when the poisonous
East Indian algae bloom

11:46.990 --> 11:48.490
covers the Pacific coastline,

11:48.491 --> 11:51.298
good-bye crab season.

11:51.578 --> 11:56.031
Coastal and marine fisheries
are a $70 billion business.

11:56.032 --> 11:58.583
Do you think we can afford to lose that?

11:58.584 --> 12:01.036
All right. Coordinate with EPA tonight.

12:01.037 --> 12:04.006
I want a report to Congress
before the weather turns warm.

12:04.007 --> 12:06.888
Most of these critters
thrive in a balmy climate.

12:06.889 --> 12:09.044
Well, the secretary is out of town.

12:09.045 --> 12:11.346
I heard, but there's no time to waste.

12:11.347 --> 12:13.215
EPA can deliver the science.

12:13.216 --> 12:14.883
State and Commerce

12:14.884 --> 12:17.469
need to jump on the
international maritime angle...

12:17.470 --> 12:18.687
crack down on smugglers,

12:18.688 --> 12:20.689
ramp up cargo and hull inspections.

12:20.690 --> 12:23.308
Otherwise, these invasive
species will just keep coming

12:23.309 --> 12:26.695
and the U.S. fishing
economy will grind to a halt.

12:26.696 --> 12:28.230
Okay, we're on it.

12:28.231 --> 12:30.949
I want an update in the morning.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.334
Should I call the secretary?

12:33.898 --> 12:35.219
Not yet.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.540
Found this in the garage.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.625
It's labeled "important papers."

12:40.626 --> 12:43.745
It's got the will in it,
this note that says, uh,

12:43.746 --> 12:45.213
he doesn't want a wake.

12:45.214 --> 12:46.248
What?

12:46.249 --> 12:48.800
Yeah, he says it's a waste of time

12:48.801 --> 12:50.252
and expensive alcohol.

12:50.253 --> 12:52.387
Good. Who wants to see
Grandpa laid out all...

12:53.840 --> 12:56.174
He's dead, John, not a zombie.

12:56.175 --> 12:58.226
Come on, guys.

12:58.227 --> 12:59.594
Um, the will just says

12:59.595 --> 13:01.980
everything's split evenly between us kids.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.566
Oh, here's the, uh, his
burial insurance policy

13:04.567 --> 13:06.018
he got from the union.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.771
I will get that obituary over to the paper.

13:09.772 --> 13:11.239
I'm j-just gonna say

13:11.240 --> 13:13.207
that he passed away.

13:14.577 --> 13:17.112
Father Benedict asked if, uh, someone

13:17.113 --> 13:18.780
was gonna speak at the service.

13:18.781 --> 13:19.581
Well, that's up to you.

13:19.582 --> 13:20.582
Well, I'd...

13:20.583 --> 13:21.867
be too emotional, too sappy.

13:21.868 --> 13:22.834
Dad would hate that.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.969
I thought you might like to do it.

13:26.589 --> 13:29.791
I don't think that I'm the guy
to get up and talk about Dad.

13:29.792 --> 13:30.876
Maybe Erin or Shane.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.294
If you change your mind...

13:32.295 --> 13:34.061
I won't.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.132
We're expected at the
mortuary at around 11:00.

13:37.133 --> 13:39.351
I'd offer to drive, but, um,

13:39.352 --> 13:41.303
I suppose your security detail

13:41.304 --> 13:43.344
will still want to follow us through town.

13:43.345 --> 13:46.775
For the last time, it's protocol.

13:46.776 --> 13:48.477
Well, it's fine.

13:48.478 --> 13:50.612
I mean, maybe everybody
will think Dad's funeral

13:50.613 --> 13:52.981
has started early and
fall into line behind us.

13:52.982 --> 13:55.233
It won't be so bad, Maureen, I promise.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.618
There's lots of legroom,

13:56.619 --> 13:59.538
and they've got bottles of
water and candy in the back.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.123
Not going to a prom.

14:01.124 --> 14:04.141
Going to find a coffin for my father.

14:05.828 --> 14:08.145
I'll come along, too.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.549
I'll get my coat.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.933
Thank you.

14:14.504 --> 14:18.423
20 gauge protective steel
with a poplar veneer.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.175
Gloss coffee finish,

14:20.176 --> 14:22.227
and an oyster crepe interior.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.646
Grandpa wouldn't want something showy

14:24.647 --> 14:25.680
and overpriced.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.233
My father-in-law was
a man of simple taste.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.184
He was cheap.

14:29.185 --> 14:31.520
Say what you're saying.

14:31.521 --> 14:33.438
This one is a gloss Cambridge finish,

14:33.439 --> 14:35.023
with swing bar hardware.

14:35.024 --> 14:37.591
It's $1,500.

14:39.362 --> 14:41.363
Maureen, what do you think?

14:41.364 --> 14:42.531
Mm.

14:42.532 --> 14:44.249
Let's talk about

14:44.250 --> 14:47.051
our life's glory package.

14:47.753 --> 14:49.504
Prayer cards, a memorial book.

14:49.505 --> 14:50.705
Uh, a word with you.

14:50.706 --> 14:52.640
Excuse me.

14:54.710 --> 14:56.795
Can we reconsider cremation?

14:56.796 --> 14:58.763
Absolutely not.

14:58.764 --> 15:01.266
It's just, he wouldn't want us
to spend all this money on him.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.685
Well, this isn't really for Grandpa, baby.

15:03.686 --> 15:04.941
It's for us.

15:04.942 --> 15:06.471
You know, so that we can feel

15:06.472 --> 15:08.390
like we've given him a proper good-bye.

15:08.391 --> 15:10.025
We have a bit of a problem.

15:10.026 --> 15:11.359
Uh, Mr. McCord

15:11.360 --> 15:14.211
allowed his insurance policy
to lapse four months ago.

15:14.897 --> 15:16.398
So none of this is covered.

15:16.399 --> 15:17.616
I'm afraid not.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.401
Yeah, you know what,

15:19.402 --> 15:21.570
let's just...

15:21.571 --> 15:23.738
...we'll put it on my card

15:23.739 --> 15:25.624
and we'll figure it out later.

15:30.379 --> 15:32.747
Hey, John wants to heat
up a cheeseburger casserole

15:32.748 --> 15:34.749
and contact Grandpa on the Ouija board.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.585
Oh, great, when you reach him,

15:36.586 --> 15:38.587
ask him what the password
is for his computer.

15:38.588 --> 15:41.438
Why are you trying to
go on Grandpa's computer?

15:42.091 --> 15:45.844
I was just thinking, you know.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.312
Why'd he do it?

15:47.313 --> 15:48.930
What made him so sad

15:48.931 --> 15:51.316
that he wanted to end it like that.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.151
Leave everything.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.119
Leave us.

15:57.607 --> 16:00.609
Mom said, uh, Debra was his girlfriend.

16:00.610 --> 16:02.944
I figured she might be
able to tell us something,

16:02.945 --> 16:04.362
so I did an image search on my phone

16:04.363 --> 16:06.164
to try and figure out her last name.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.666
And?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.118
Her name isn't Debra.

16:10.119 --> 16:11.453
It's Janet Nelson.

16:11.454 --> 16:13.288
She's not from Pittsburgh.

16:13.289 --> 16:14.789
She's an actress from L.A.

16:14.790 --> 16:17.459
This photo was pulled off of the Internet.

16:17.460 --> 16:20.045
Something isn't right.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.528
Okay.

16:26.102 --> 16:27.519
Here's his password.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.804
Classic old person trick.

16:29.805 --> 16:32.357
Mm.

16:32.358 --> 16:34.809
What a day, wow.

16:34.810 --> 16:37.395
So your dad's insurance policy lapsed,

16:37.396 --> 16:39.814
so I gave them my card, of course,

16:39.815 --> 16:42.913
which annoyed Maureen, holy smoke.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.486
Babe, the kids went through Dad's computer.

16:44.487 --> 16:45.620
They found something.

16:45.621 --> 16:47.921
What do you mean?

16:48.958 --> 16:52.043
About seven months ago,
he joined a dating site.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.795
A woman contacted him.

16:53.796 --> 16:54.796
Said her name was Debra.

16:54.797 --> 16:56.464
Said all the right things.

16:56.465 --> 16:57.666
They had all the same interests.

16:57.667 --> 16:59.417
He wanted to meet, but
she said she couldn't.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.169
She was out of town
working on some investments.

17:01.170 --> 17:02.170
Let me guess,

17:02.171 --> 17:03.471
she couldn't come home

17:03.472 --> 17:06.424
until all those issues were settled.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.644
So, he offered to help out with a loan.

17:09.645 --> 17:11.313
How much?

17:11.314 --> 17:12.896
I don't know the total yet,

17:12.897 --> 17:15.183
but there are e-mails
on here from the bank.

17:15.184 --> 17:17.652
First it was about cash
transfers, then about

17:17.653 --> 17:18.903
taking out a line of credit on the house.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.155
It was everything he had.

17:20.156 --> 17:22.406
50 years of hard work and doing without.

17:22.407 --> 17:23.924
It's all gone.

17:25.944 --> 17:29.012
He couldn't see a way out.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.950
We were a way out.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.434
We could have helped him.

17:34.170 --> 17:38.123
Your dad admit that he'd been swindled?

17:38.124 --> 17:40.425
Call his children and ask for money?

17:40.426 --> 17:42.510
Live out his life like a burden.

17:42.511 --> 17:43.878
It wouldn't be like that.

17:43.879 --> 17:45.880
No.

17:45.881 --> 17:47.766
But to him it would.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.802
I know, but...

17:50.803 --> 17:51.970
I never thought his pride

17:51.971 --> 17:55.205
would mean more to him than his family.

17:56.859 --> 18:00.661
More than watching our kids grow up.

18:11.470 --> 18:14.462
Okay, I'll say it, is there any
way we can get back the money?

18:14.907 --> 18:16.124
You're all thinking it.

18:16.125 --> 18:18.172
Maybe not Henry and Elizabeth,

18:18.173 --> 18:20.041
but I could sure use my share.

18:20.042 --> 18:21.656
Look, I spoke with Detective Swanstrom

18:21.657 --> 18:24.125
and you know, he was sympathetic,

18:24.126 --> 18:25.577
but...

18:25.578 --> 18:27.796
the truth is, most of these scams

18:27.797 --> 18:29.247
are perpetrated in other countries.

18:29.248 --> 18:30.887
Well, then you're talking
to the wrong person.

18:30.888 --> 18:31.967
I mean, hell, you're sitting next

18:31.968 --> 18:32.994
to the Secretary of State.

18:32.995 --> 18:34.085
Other countries is her business.

18:34.086 --> 18:35.887
Could you do anything, Elizabeth?

18:35.888 --> 18:37.255
Pull some strings?

18:37.256 --> 18:38.640
I wish it was that simple.

18:38.641 --> 18:39.724
Well, make it simple.

18:39.725 --> 18:41.426
Call the president. Say it's protocol.

18:41.427 --> 18:43.178
The thing is, that the State Department

18:43.179 --> 18:45.347
doesn't really handle
these kinds of things.

18:45.348 --> 18:47.399
What my wife is too polite to say

18:47.400 --> 18:48.984
is that what you're asking
her to do is unethical.

18:48.985 --> 18:50.936
Elizabeth is always
saying she wants to help.

18:50.937 --> 18:52.103
We need help.

18:52.104 --> 18:54.121
- Maureen... drop it.
- Why can't...!

18:57.026 --> 18:58.493
Well, like Shane was saying,

18:58.494 --> 19:00.510
you're not counting on that money, anyway.

19:06.752 --> 19:09.053
Hey, guys.

19:10.256 --> 19:11.339
Maureen.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.874
Oh, thank you.

19:12.875 --> 19:14.960
We're so sorry about Patrick.

19:14.961 --> 19:16.628
You remember Stan and Barry, right, guys?

19:16.629 --> 19:17.918
Oh, hey. Hey, guys.

19:17.919 --> 19:20.564
- They worked with Dad on the union board.
- Come on in.

19:22.351 --> 19:24.269
I'll send you the e-mail address

19:24.270 --> 19:25.804
that I want tracked

19:25.805 --> 19:29.608
and, I'm, uh,

19:29.609 --> 19:31.363
I'm hoping that Oliver Shaw

19:31.364 --> 19:33.248
can recommend someone.

19:33.249 --> 19:34.950
Are you sure there's nothing else

19:34.951 --> 19:36.868
I can do for you, or your family?

19:36.869 --> 19:38.203
Thanks for holding down the fort.

19:38.204 --> 19:39.838
I'll talk soon, okay?

19:42.375 --> 19:44.176
Any room left in here?

19:44.177 --> 19:45.093
No, um,

19:45.094 --> 19:46.962
but we can find some.

19:46.963 --> 19:48.046
And we were downtown,

19:48.047 --> 19:49.514
visiting the guys...

19:49.515 --> 19:50.882
Bar, was it Mellon Center?

19:50.883 --> 19:52.217
Sure was.

19:52.218 --> 19:54.803
Yeah, your dad sees a welder we knew,

19:54.804 --> 19:55.721
leaving for the day.

19:55.722 --> 19:57.689
The guy doesn't have a coat on.

19:57.690 --> 20:00.225
Says, he gave it to his kid,

20:00.226 --> 20:03.228
'cause he couldn't afford a new one.

20:03.229 --> 20:05.781
Your dad takes off his own coat...

20:05.782 --> 20:08.400
It was vicuna, I remember.

20:08.401 --> 20:11.570
...and he just gives it to the guy.

20:11.571 --> 20:14.623
That's so like him.

20:14.624 --> 20:16.575
Well, we aren't going

20:16.576 --> 20:18.126
to take up any more of your time.

20:18.127 --> 20:20.996
My wife has the same kind of
heart condition as your dad.

20:20.997 --> 20:24.132
They were always telling
each other to take good care,

20:24.133 --> 20:26.484
but I guess sometimes
there's nothing to be done.

20:31.140 --> 20:34.843
We just assumed he took a heart attack.

20:34.844 --> 20:36.395
Was it something else?

20:36.396 --> 20:39.765
The truth is...

20:39.766 --> 20:42.317
he was in a bad place, and he

20:42.318 --> 20:43.935
couldn't reach out for help.

20:43.936 --> 20:45.854
What Henry means is that
our dad was in a bad place

20:45.855 --> 20:47.155
because he was so sick.

20:47.156 --> 20:48.156
Maureen,

20:48.157 --> 20:49.941
if we can't talk about how he died,

20:49.942 --> 20:52.042
then we won't be able to mourn him.

20:54.197 --> 20:56.498
Our dad took his own life.

20:58.835 --> 21:00.669
I'm so sorry.

21:00.670 --> 21:03.422
Well, thank you. It's been very difficult.

21:03.423 --> 21:05.874
And I hope it doesn't
change how you remember him.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.343
No.

21:08.344 --> 21:11.111
Of course not.

21:11.848 --> 21:14.132
Thank you

21:14.133 --> 21:15.866
so much for coming.

21:22.308 --> 21:24.158
We agreed.

21:24.944 --> 21:26.812
No, Maureen, you insisted.

21:26.813 --> 21:29.614
I'm not gonna treat this
like some shameful secret.

21:29.615 --> 21:30.747
I'm not gonna lie about our father.

21:30.748 --> 21:32.534
Can't you keep your
high-and-mighty mouth shut

21:32.535 --> 21:33.702
for two seconds?

21:33.703 --> 21:36.007
But no, everything just
has to be done your way,

21:36.008 --> 21:37.089
like we don't count.

21:37.090 --> 21:39.604
Hey, pot, you and the kettle
are looking a little black there.

21:39.605 --> 21:40.844
- Stay out of this, Shane.
- No.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.670
You don't get to decide for the rest of us

21:42.671 --> 21:44.109
what we can feel or say.

21:44.110 --> 21:45.611
Yes, I do, because I was here every day,

21:45.612 --> 21:47.363
taking care of Mom, taking care of Dad.

21:47.364 --> 21:49.474
I live across town,
Erin's ten minutes away...

21:49.475 --> 21:50.641
Yeah, but you were never here.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.910
Maybe Sunday dinners,

21:51.911 --> 21:53.496
the Super Bowl. I cleaned the toilets.

21:53.497 --> 21:55.229
I cooked the meals. I took care of him.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.959
If you took such good care of him, Maureen,

21:56.960 --> 21:58.044
then why is he dead?

21:58.045 --> 21:59.777
- Erin, don't.
- No, I am sick of her

21:59.778 --> 22:01.080
lording everything over me!

22:01.081 --> 22:01.839
Can we get past this?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.259
No, you are already past this!

22:03.260 --> 22:05.011
You and Elizabeth breeze into town

22:05.012 --> 22:06.713
visiting us on your book tour,

22:06.714 --> 22:08.381
waving to us from the motorcade.

22:08.382 --> 22:10.012
Just don't think that
puts you in charge now,

22:10.013 --> 22:11.968
just because she can put the
funeral on her credit card!

22:11.969 --> 22:13.771
- What's this now?
- It was just a temporary fix.

22:13.772 --> 22:14.739
I'm just trying to help.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.265
Trying to one up all of us like usual.

22:16.266 --> 22:17.300
You know what we call her.

22:17.301 --> 22:18.135
Queen Elizabeth.

22:18.136 --> 22:19.657
Queen Elizabeth... like it's a big secret!

22:19.658 --> 22:20.741
We're not stupid, Maureen.

22:20.742 --> 22:22.969
- We're not deaf!
- I never called her that.

22:23.112 --> 22:24.612
- I didn't! I didn't!
- But she did!

22:24.613 --> 22:26.497
Nobody should be calling her that!

22:26.498 --> 22:28.708
When you took up with
Elizabeth, you changed!

22:28.709 --> 22:30.625
- That's enough!
- Turning up your nose at us "yinzers,"

22:30.626 --> 22:32.911
acting like a new man with a fancy degree

22:32.912 --> 22:34.127
and a rich wife!

22:34.128 --> 22:35.789
You are way over the line, Maureen!

22:35.790 --> 22:38.062
You guys are screaming so
loud we can't hear the TV.

22:38.063 --> 22:40.385
- What's going on?
- We're having a family discussion.

22:40.386 --> 22:42.170
Yeah, but it's over. Come on, kids.

22:42.171 --> 22:43.505
If it makes you feel better,

22:43.506 --> 22:44.756
we'll leave right after the funeral.

22:44.757 --> 22:45.696
Blow into town,

22:45.697 --> 22:47.081
turn everything upside down,

22:47.082 --> 22:48.583
then blow right back out again.

22:48.584 --> 22:49.750
What else is new?

22:49.751 --> 22:51.369
Oh, you...

23:02.740 --> 23:04.408
Got a minute?

23:04.409 --> 23:06.759
Not since 1992.

23:08.046 --> 23:09.663
Yeah, it's all right.

23:09.664 --> 23:11.048
Come in.

23:11.049 --> 23:14.718
I went through the East
Africa report again last night.

23:14.719 --> 23:17.143
There's been a change

23:17.266 --> 23:19.389
since we sent it to you for approval.

23:19.390 --> 23:22.726
The CIA redacted a few
lines, classified them.

23:22.727 --> 23:23.710
As is their wont.

23:23.711 --> 23:24.928
The redacted portion

23:24.929 --> 23:27.981
is a short paragraph
regarding Senator Marc Stone.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.933
He was part of a congressional

23:29.934 --> 23:33.604
fact-finding trip to China in 2013.

23:33.605 --> 23:34.988
They visited

23:34.989 --> 23:37.858
the Wudang Construction Company.

23:37.859 --> 23:40.713
Wudang is run by the Chinese government

23:40.714 --> 23:44.557
and is at the top of our
list of corrupt contractors.

23:44.558 --> 23:45.666
You don't say.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.117
Wudang also

23:47.118 --> 23:50.984
owns an American subsidiary
called KPT Building.

23:50.985 --> 23:53.152
It's based in Arizona.

23:53.153 --> 23:55.705
That's Stone's home state.

23:55.706 --> 23:58.803
CIA has been all over this report

23:58.804 --> 24:00.377
since we started compiling it.

24:00.378 --> 24:03.041
Why did they wait until the last minute

24:03.042 --> 24:05.073
to classify that paragraph?

24:05.074 --> 24:07.991
Are you asking me a
question or is this a setup

24:07.992 --> 24:10.043
for an accusation?

24:10.044 --> 24:11.078
I think you sent

24:11.079 --> 24:12.746
the State Department on an invasive

24:12.747 --> 24:14.414
aquatic snipe hunt.

24:14.415 --> 24:16.550
Then you convinced someone at the Agency

24:16.551 --> 24:19.169
to redact the report.

24:19.170 --> 24:21.054
What I do not understand is why.

24:21.055 --> 24:22.806
The CIA did it,

24:22.807 --> 24:25.592
so take it up with them.

24:25.593 --> 24:27.260
Or better yet,

24:27.261 --> 24:29.528
leave it alone.

24:30.598 --> 24:31.765
Is that an order?

24:31.766 --> 24:33.082
Yes.

24:36.738 --> 24:39.038
I don't take orders from you.

24:46.331 --> 24:48.415
Is that the office calling?

24:48.416 --> 24:51.785
Yeah, but not about State business.

24:51.786 --> 24:53.754
I asked Blake

24:53.755 --> 24:55.956
to trace the person who scammed your dad.

24:55.957 --> 24:57.507
You didn't have to do that.

24:57.508 --> 24:59.092
I know.

24:59.093 --> 25:01.294
But it worked.

25:01.295 --> 25:03.714
The scammer lives right here in Pittsburgh.

25:03.715 --> 25:05.981
It's his friend Stan.

25:16.561 --> 25:19.312
For what it's worth, he's pretty broken up.

25:19.313 --> 25:21.898
I got a full confession
in the car on the way over.

25:21.899 --> 25:24.368
Did he say why he did it?

25:24.369 --> 25:25.652
Well, short answer?

25:25.653 --> 25:27.070
He needed money.

25:27.071 --> 25:28.155
His sister's sick.

25:28.156 --> 25:29.406
They're drowning in bills.

25:29.407 --> 25:31.041
Says he read an article
about these scammers

25:31.042 --> 25:33.493
who were making thousands
ripping off older people.

25:33.494 --> 25:35.078
So he trolls the dating site,

25:35.079 --> 25:37.414
and happens to come
across your dad's profile.

25:37.415 --> 25:38.799
He knew how generous our dad was.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.667
Thought he'd be an easy mark.

25:40.668 --> 25:42.669
The DA will be in touch.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.820
I'm sorry, folks.

25:48.893 --> 25:50.310
That's that, then.

25:50.311 --> 25:52.062
Hey, Maureen?

25:52.063 --> 25:53.180
Wait.

25:54.399 --> 25:57.067
You're so angry at me.

25:57.068 --> 25:59.186
What can I do to make this right?

25:59.187 --> 26:01.104
Can you give me my father back?

26:01.105 --> 26:02.406
Can you make it like he never

26:02.407 --> 26:04.088
did this awful, awful thing?

26:04.089 --> 26:04.658
You know

26:04.659 --> 26:06.821
if he had reached out, I
would've done anything to help.

26:06.822 --> 26:07.444
Would you?

26:07.445 --> 26:08.361
Of course.

26:08.362 --> 26:10.113
Maureen, just let it go.

26:11.499 --> 26:13.849
I can't stop thinking why
he didn't call you, Henry.

26:13.918 --> 26:15.332
I mean, the rest of us, he knew

26:15.333 --> 26:16.870
we didn't have any room to take him in.

26:16.871 --> 26:18.955
God knows we don't have
any money, but you do.

26:18.956 --> 26:20.757
And then I remembered.

26:20.758 --> 26:22.676
A couple of years ago,

26:22.677 --> 26:24.344
I was helping him up the stairs

26:24.345 --> 26:25.629
after a few too many.

26:25.630 --> 26:27.047
It was, it was during that bad time

26:27.048 --> 26:28.432
when the union had kicked him to the curb.

26:28.433 --> 26:30.183
And he started talking about someone

26:30.184 --> 26:31.852
who turned their back on him.

26:31.853 --> 26:33.470
I figured it was a buddy of his.

26:33.471 --> 26:35.055
But no.

26:35.056 --> 26:36.857
He was talking about you.

26:36.858 --> 26:38.442
He said you rejected him.

26:38.443 --> 26:40.777
That you treated him like he was a failure.

26:40.778 --> 26:43.063
He said it was the worst
pain he'd ever felt.

26:43.064 --> 26:44.865
Maureen, that...

26:44.866 --> 26:46.319
that never happened.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.118
Are calling Patrick McCord a liar?

26:48.119 --> 26:49.703
No, I'm saying

26:49.704 --> 26:51.705
that maybe you misunderstood.

26:51.706 --> 26:53.707
No, he was very clear.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.742
It was a while ago.

26:55.743 --> 26:57.760
But it happened.

27:00.748 --> 27:02.013
And at the lowest point of his life,

27:02.014 --> 27:03.009
if he reached out to you

27:03.010 --> 27:05.085
and you turned your back on him again...

27:05.086 --> 27:07.504
that would be the worst thing.

27:07.505 --> 27:08.922
Worse than losing all his money.

27:08.923 --> 27:10.173
Worse than death.

27:10.174 --> 27:12.726
So he didn't even try.

27:12.727 --> 27:14.344
Instead he just...

27:14.345 --> 27:15.995
went to sleep.

27:16.931 --> 27:18.732
And we can all say that we would've done

27:18.733 --> 27:20.567
anything to help him, that
we couldn't see the signs.

27:20.568 --> 27:22.402
We can say whatever we want
now, because it's too late.

27:22.403 --> 27:25.272
But I say...

27:25.273 --> 27:27.840
I say he's dead because of you.

27:57.805 --> 28:00.706
You want to go for a walk?

28:06.614 --> 28:08.114
My first year at UVA,

28:08.115 --> 28:11.067
I was working so hard to fit in.

28:11.068 --> 28:14.454
I just did not feel like I belonged there.

28:14.455 --> 28:15.705
Well, you were 17,

28:15.706 --> 28:17.556
you'd never been away from home.

28:20.077 --> 28:22.394
My dad came to Parent's Weekend.

28:24.248 --> 28:26.416
I showed him the campus, my dorm.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.418
He was his typical self...

28:28.419 --> 28:29.719
the room's too small,

28:29.720 --> 28:31.805
the water pressure's too low,

28:31.806 --> 28:33.890
he wanted to know did they
give me a third-class berth

28:33.891 --> 28:35.342
'cause I was a scholarship kid?

28:35.343 --> 28:37.594
Well, your dad, never one to be

28:37.595 --> 28:39.995
stingy with his opinions.

28:41.349 --> 28:44.651
There was a big dinner that night,

28:44.652 --> 28:46.770
father and son thing.

28:46.771 --> 28:50.607
All the guys in my class were going.

28:50.608 --> 28:53.526
I didn't even tell him it was happening.

28:53.527 --> 28:56.413
That's how nervous I was he'd make a scene.

28:56.414 --> 28:58.949
He'd start quizzing the
big shots at my table

28:58.950 --> 29:02.419
about how badly they treated their workers.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.204
It seems crazy now,

29:04.205 --> 29:06.873
but being embarrassed at that dinner

29:06.874 --> 29:09.525
felt like it would end my world.

29:10.878 --> 29:12.629
So,

29:12.630 --> 29:15.682
we were walking off-campus
to grab dinner in town.

29:15.683 --> 29:17.900
I took a wrong turn.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.688
There we were at the hall.

29:21.689 --> 29:23.106
There was a big banner.

29:23.107 --> 29:25.025
All the guys were going in with their dads.

29:25.026 --> 29:27.560
And they looked like...

29:27.561 --> 29:29.896
what they were.

29:29.897 --> 29:32.232
Proper gentlemen.

29:32.233 --> 29:34.651
Young masters of the universe.

29:34.652 --> 29:35.819
I looked over.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.320
My dad had stopped walking.

29:37.321 --> 29:40.457
Looked up at the banner.

29:40.458 --> 29:43.543
All the boys with their fathers.

29:43.544 --> 29:46.562
And I'll never forget the look on his face.

29:50.801 --> 29:53.986
He knew I was ashamed of him.

29:56.924 --> 29:59.592
That's what he told Maureen.

29:59.593 --> 30:01.645
Did you ever talk to him about it?

30:01.646 --> 30:05.253
Yeah, I tried to apologize
a few times over the years.

30:05.254 --> 30:06.683
He acted like he didn't remember,

30:06.684 --> 30:08.234
but he did.

30:08.235 --> 30:11.036
I keep thinking...

30:13.274 --> 30:15.525
...maybe when he called last week,

30:15.526 --> 30:19.515
should I have tried again

30:19.516 --> 30:21.031
to say I was sorry

30:21.032 --> 30:23.583
and really made him listen?

30:23.584 --> 30:25.618
Do you think

30:25.619 --> 30:29.605
maybe that was the opening
he needed to ask for my help?

30:31.625 --> 30:34.594
I think he knew you loved him.

30:34.595 --> 30:38.431
And he knew that you'd grow
up to be a good man, Henry.

30:38.432 --> 30:41.601
So I think you have to forgive

30:41.602 --> 30:43.436
that 17-year-old boy,

30:43.437 --> 30:47.273
who was young and thoughtless.

30:47.274 --> 30:51.144
If for no other reason,

30:51.145 --> 30:54.230
you'll need the practice

30:54.231 --> 30:56.366
to forgive Jason someday

30:56.367 --> 30:58.750
when he does something like that.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.658
I think your dad did call for a reason.

31:05.659 --> 31:08.328
Not to ask for help.

31:08.329 --> 31:10.663
I think he needed to know

31:10.664 --> 31:14.099
that you two were ending on a good note.

31:17.722 --> 31:19.988
He was saying good-bye to me.

31:57.099 --> 31:58.232
Hey, Dad.

31:58.233 --> 31:59.817
Hi, Jace. You ready?

31:59.818 --> 32:01.450
Yeah, almost.

32:03.771 --> 32:06.657
I'm really sorry about the way
I talked to you the other day.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.609
It's okay.

32:08.610 --> 32:11.662
I'm sorry I made fun of you about college.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.614
I don't want to be like you.

32:14.949 --> 32:16.617
I didn't want to be like my old man either.

32:16.618 --> 32:17.618
I get it.

32:17.619 --> 32:20.587
I mean, like you and Grandpa.

32:20.588 --> 32:24.307
I don't want to be fighting
with you when you die.

32:26.294 --> 32:29.278
I'm not gonna let that happen, I promise.

32:31.299 --> 32:34.718
It's true, my dad and I weren't close.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.053
We didn't see eye to eye

32:36.054 --> 32:40.323
on... well, anything.

32:42.277 --> 32:44.910
But I want you to feel
like you can talk to me.

32:47.198 --> 32:49.749
And I'll listen.

32:51.452 --> 32:53.052
That's really the...

32:55.206 --> 32:56.839
...key to everything.

33:00.828 --> 33:03.497
The Lord bless you and keep you.

33:03.498 --> 33:07.301
The Lord let his face shine
upon you and be gracious to you.

33:07.302 --> 33:12.005
The Lord look upon you
kindly and give you peace.

33:12.006 --> 33:13.340
Amen.

33:13.341 --> 33:14.725
Amen.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.678
Before we begin the commendation,

33:17.679 --> 33:20.731
Patrick's son, Henry, has
asked to say a few words

33:20.732 --> 33:23.949
in remembrance of his father.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.418
The thing my dad hated
second most in the world

33:41.419 --> 33:43.003
was a restaurant.

33:43.004 --> 33:46.006
"Why drive to some place and
have a stranger cook you food

33:46.007 --> 33:48.458
when you can have it
better and cheaper at home?"

33:51.429 --> 33:54.715
The thing he hated most was a wedding.

33:54.716 --> 33:56.383
"Why would you spend all that money

33:56.384 --> 33:58.552
"when the marriage might not even work out?

33:58.553 --> 34:01.888
Stay married for ten years,
and then have a party."

34:01.889 --> 34:04.558
Maybe I'm giving you the
wrong idea about my dad.

34:04.559 --> 34:06.944
He hated restaurants and weddings,

34:06.945 --> 34:10.280
but he loved a good meal.

34:10.281 --> 34:12.282
And he believed in marriage.

34:12.283 --> 34:16.286
He just didn't see the
point in all the fanfare.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.371
So I think it's a pretty safe bet

34:18.373 --> 34:19.656
that he would not be too happy

34:19.657 --> 34:22.341
with what we're doing here today.

34:23.293 --> 34:26.246
My dad was a proud man.

34:26.246 --> 34:29.299
He didn't believe in showing

34:29.300 --> 34:32.552
any vulnerability to the world,

34:32.553 --> 34:35.922
and he passed that on to all of us.

34:35.922 --> 34:39.810
It mostly served us well,
but it robbed us, too.

34:39.811 --> 34:42.596
It robbed us of the gift of...

34:42.597 --> 34:45.315
letting someone else lend a hand,

34:45.315 --> 34:48.018
the gift of letting someone you love

34:48.018 --> 34:50.002
see you at-at your weakest.

34:51.739 --> 34:53.690
Made us hold onto grudges

34:53.690 --> 34:56.743
when all we really needed to do...

34:56.744 --> 35:00.030
was say...

35:00.031 --> 35:02.715
"I was wrong, and I'm sorry."

35:05.837 --> 35:07.788
I'm looking at my family now,

35:07.789 --> 35:12.459
and... I see how proud you are...

35:12.460 --> 35:15.128
and how strong you're all trying to be,

35:15.129 --> 35:19.132
but I think the best gift that we can give

35:19.133 --> 35:22.485
to our father now that he's gone...

35:28.893 --> 35:31.194
...is to admit that
our hearts are breaking.

35:31.195 --> 35:34.231
I think it would go better for us

35:34.232 --> 35:37.583
if we... could lean on each other...

35:40.655 --> 35:43.005
...and let our hearts break together.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.677
I think he would like that.

35:50.331 --> 35:53.333
And then shape up and
pull ourselves together

35:53.334 --> 35:56.420
and, Jiminy Christmas, quit that crying.

36:08.182 --> 36:10.851
"A song of ascents.

36:10.852 --> 36:14.237
"I raise my eyes toward the mountains.

36:14.238 --> 36:16.990
From whence shall come my help?"

36:34.625 --> 36:37.260
Henry, smiling like he doesn't have

36:37.261 --> 36:38.285
Oh, I was not smiling.

36:38.286 --> 36:39.262
...a care in the world.

36:39.263 --> 36:41.131
I was scared to death.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.133
Yeah, 'cause Dad's car
is sinking into the lake.

36:43.134 --> 36:46.052
And Dad says, "Son,
what the hell happened?"

36:46.053 --> 36:47.471
And Henry says...

36:47.472 --> 36:49.689
I said I swerved to
avoid a cow in the road.

36:49.690 --> 36:50.953
- What?
- Come on.

36:50.954 --> 36:52.225
- And, no, and Dad...
- That's true.

36:52.226 --> 36:54.277
- It's true.
- And Dad says, "Listen, kid, next time...

36:54.278 --> 36:56.530
there's a cow in the road,
don't crash the car just..."

36:56.531 --> 36:58.231
"Bring home the steak dinner."

36:58.232 --> 37:01.201
You were the reason he wouldn't
let me get a car till I was 18.

37:01.202 --> 37:03.236
No, pal, that was because
you stole Mom's car

37:03.237 --> 37:04.488
and blew the engine doing doughnuts

37:04.489 --> 37:05.489
in the parking lot of the A&P.

37:05.490 --> 37:06.706
- Okay, I did do that.
- Remember?

37:06.707 --> 37:08.959
- With me, unbuckled in the back seat.
- Yeah.

37:08.960 --> 37:12.629
I was just checking on
the progress with the EPA.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.381
The staff has been in meetings all day.

37:14.382 --> 37:19.169
While you've been in here,
checking up on Senator Stone?

37:19.170 --> 37:21.755
You called Marlene Creston,

37:21.756 --> 37:23.473
the head of the Senate
Select Committee on Ethics.

37:23.474 --> 37:25.809
She didn't find anything.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.394
And I still have no idea

37:27.395 --> 37:29.479
why you wanted that paragraph classified.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.932
You gonna let it go now?

37:31.933 --> 37:33.832
That's not in my nature.

37:36.571 --> 37:38.871
Okay then.

37:41.909 --> 37:45.829
Stone is an ally of Dalton's,

37:45.830 --> 37:48.865
running for reelection on
his record, which is spotless,

37:48.866 --> 37:51.585
but his challenger is well-funded.

37:51.586 --> 37:53.119
She's going negative,

37:53.120 --> 37:55.789
so Stone approved his super PAC

37:55.790 --> 37:58.458
and a dark money nonprofit
organization to fund it.

37:58.459 --> 38:03.346
KPT Building made a donation
to that nonprofit of $100,000.

38:03.347 --> 38:07.184
KPT Building, which is owned
by the Chinese government.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.970
KPT Building, which is
an American subsidiary

38:09.971 --> 38:11.388
of Wudang Construction,

38:11.389 --> 38:14.391
which is owned by the
Chinese government, yes.

38:14.392 --> 38:16.047
So is this a quid pro quo?

38:16.048 --> 38:16.974
Of course not.

38:16.975 --> 38:18.645
KPT just wants to defeat Stone's opponent,

38:18.646 --> 38:20.113
who's for stricter logging controls.

38:20.114 --> 38:21.698
But the Chinese government

38:21.699 --> 38:25.151
is still indirectly financing
an American election.

38:25.152 --> 38:27.237
And thanks to the vagaries
of Citizens United,

38:27.238 --> 38:29.239
it's all perfectly legal.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.825
Then why redact the paragraph?

38:31.826 --> 38:34.828
Because if someone with an ax to grind

38:34.829 --> 38:37.631
were to read the unredacted
East Africa report,

38:37.632 --> 38:40.417
they could possibly make a connection

38:40.418 --> 38:42.168
between Stone and Wudang Construction.

38:42.169 --> 38:43.386
They could make it look

38:43.387 --> 38:45.138
like Marc Stone is in bed with the Chinese.

38:45.139 --> 38:46.640
Isn't he?

38:46.641 --> 38:50.927
He's an honest politician who's
been forced to accept dark money

38:50.928 --> 38:54.514
so he can continue to play
on this new level field.

38:54.515 --> 38:55.849
Don't blame me, blame the Supreme Court

38:55.850 --> 38:56.933
for a bad decision.

38:56.934 --> 38:58.568
The president would love to put a stake

38:58.569 --> 39:00.570
through the heart of Citizens United,

39:00.571 --> 39:01.988
but you know he's not gonna get traction

39:01.989 --> 39:03.323
in congress anytime soon.

39:03.324 --> 39:05.575
He'll need a second term
and every bit of support

39:05.576 --> 39:08.945
in the senate that he can muster.

39:08.946 --> 39:13.250
So, yes, I asked a friend at the Agency

39:13.251 --> 39:15.201
to redact that section of the report.

39:15.202 --> 39:16.620
I didn't tell the president about it.

39:16.621 --> 39:20.624
If the contribution ever
does become public knowledge,

39:20.625 --> 39:22.926
Dalton can honestly say
he knows nothing about it.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.678
And what about the secretary?

39:24.679 --> 39:25.679
She's protected as well.

39:25.680 --> 39:26.930
That's our job.

39:26.931 --> 39:28.548
We take the hits so they don't have to.

39:28.549 --> 39:30.600
But you didn't bring me in beforehand,

39:30.601 --> 39:32.519
so now I have to tell her.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.888
Do what you want.

39:34.889 --> 39:36.439
Just make sure she knows

39:36.440 --> 39:39.442
we're saving American's
oceans while you're at it.

39:39.443 --> 39:42.896
Those invasive species really are a menace.

39:42.897 --> 39:44.864
Russell.

39:44.865 --> 39:46.149
In the future,

39:46.150 --> 39:48.985
you might consider being
more forthcoming with me.

39:48.986 --> 39:52.289
That's not really in my nature,

39:52.290 --> 39:56.091
but... noted.

40:02.383 --> 40:03.717
All our bags are downstairs.

40:03.718 --> 40:06.018
Then this is the last one.

40:07.722 --> 40:10.423
I bet you're glad to be getting home,

40:10.424 --> 40:12.392
get back to being yourself.

40:12.393 --> 40:14.427
What do you mean?

40:14.428 --> 40:17.847
I don't know, it's just...

40:17.848 --> 40:20.183
at home, you would never let anyone

40:20.184 --> 40:22.736
talk to you the way that Aunt Maureen does.

40:22.737 --> 40:24.437
Why don't you ever shut her down?

40:24.438 --> 40:27.824
Oh, Stevie, I was so
young when my parents died.

40:27.825 --> 40:30.827
Then it was just your Uncle Will and me.

40:30.828 --> 40:34.447
We were away at boarding
schools most of the year.

40:34.448 --> 40:38.168
Thanksgivings, just the two of us.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.003
Dinner in front of the TV.

40:40.004 --> 40:42.354
One Christmas, I just...

40:44.425 --> 40:46.358
...stayed at school.

40:47.461 --> 40:50.513
There was this huge snowstorm,

40:50.514 --> 40:54.134
and I got snowed in,

40:54.135 --> 40:59.121
and it was so... quiet.

41:00.441 --> 41:03.792
I didn't speak to another soul for days.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.449
And then I fell in love with your dad.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.652
And he took me home and introduced me

41:12.653 --> 41:17.407
to his big, messy, raucous family.

41:17.408 --> 41:20.043
At the McCord house,

41:20.044 --> 41:22.996
it was never quiet.

41:22.997 --> 41:27.717
Sometimes they're laughing,
sometimes fighting,

41:27.718 --> 41:32.505
but it's always loud and on fire.

41:32.506 --> 41:37.177
And if I shut Maureen down,

41:37.178 --> 41:39.229
I'd be putting out that fire.

41:39.230 --> 41:40.764
I don't want to do that.

41:40.765 --> 41:42.982
I just want to be a part of it.

41:42.983 --> 41:44.150
You know?

41:44.151 --> 41:45.784
Yeah.

41:47.021 --> 41:49.522
You need any help cleaning out the house...

41:49.523 --> 41:52.075
Erin and Shane and the
kids will be around, so...

41:52.076 --> 41:54.077
Well, maybe we'll get
lucky and find some cash

41:54.078 --> 41:55.361
after the bank takes their cut.

41:55.362 --> 41:57.614
Maybe. Either way, we'll be all right.

41:57.615 --> 41:58.865
I know we will.

41:58.866 --> 41:59.877
Easter?

41:59.878 --> 42:00.700
Oh.

42:00.701 --> 42:02.301
Bye.

42:05.005 --> 42:06.372
Bye.

42:10.010 --> 42:11.845
Bye!

42:14.131 --> 42:16.099
Later!

42:28.696 --> 42:30.563
_

42:30.564 --> 42:31.904
It is uncanny.

42:31.905 --> 42:34.784
I mean, Blake knows exactly when
it's the best time to get me.

42:34.785 --> 42:36.152
It's just...

42:36.153 --> 42:37.454
I called Uncle Will.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.905
Hey.

42:38.906 --> 42:40.373
- Hey, Will.
- Hi. Hey, Will.

42:40.374 --> 42:41.624
How are you?

42:41.625 --> 42:44.377
Well, I-I could use
another three hours sleep.

42:44.378 --> 42:47.046
Henry, I-I am so... so sorry

42:47.047 --> 42:49.165
that I couldn't make
it out for the funeral.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.551
You know how fond I was of your father.

42:51.552 --> 42:53.253
He was a tough old guy.

42:53.254 --> 42:54.587
Yeah, he was.

42:54.588 --> 42:55.805
Thanks, Will.

42:55.806 --> 42:57.474
- Hi, Uncle Will.
- Hi.

42:57.475 --> 42:58.686
There you go. Here you go.

42:58.687 --> 42:59.759
Hello, McCords.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.144
We miss you.

43:02.065 --> 43:04.086
Hey, what are you doing?

43:04.185 --> 43:05.648
Where are you?

43:05.649 --> 43:13.467
