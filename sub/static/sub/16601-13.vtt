WEBVTT

00:08.083 --> 00:09.917
You know we should be back
at the squad right now

00:09.919 --> 00:11.785
doing fives on
the Mendez murder.

00:11.787 --> 00:12.886
Yeah.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.421
But look at that view.

00:14.423 --> 00:16.723
Couple more minutes
won't hurt.

00:16.725 --> 00:19.393
It is pretty, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.

00:19.395 --> 00:22.296
Especially when you consider
all those who suffered for weeks

00:22.298 --> 00:24.965
on those coffin ships
just to see that face.

00:24.967 --> 00:26.233
It'd be nice

00:26.235 --> 00:28.368
if she had a smile, though,
I mean, even just a small one.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.270
I mean, think about it,
if you stood there all day

00:30.272 --> 00:32.706
welcoming people and
got no thanks for it,

00:32.708 --> 00:34.308
you might not smile
that much either.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.677
5-4 detectives

00:36.679 --> 00:38.178
respond to St. Daniels ER
to interview

00:38.180 --> 00:39.546
male assault complainant.

00:39.548 --> 00:41.982
5-4 detectives,
copy that.

00:41.984 --> 00:44.151
You know what else
I love about her?

00:44.153 --> 00:46.920
Despite all the bad stuff
she's seen, just like cops,

00:46.922 --> 00:48.388
she's still standing.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

01:03.606 --> 01:04.837
Nice 4-4-2.

01:04.840 --> 01:05.806
Thanks.

01:05.808 --> 01:07.541
Three speed or four?
Four.

01:07.543 --> 01:09.476
Oh, that's the way to go.
You?

01:09.478 --> 01:12.379
Oh, I got a hurt SS 396
sitting in my dad's garage.

01:12.381 --> 01:14.081
What are you
doing with it?

01:14.083 --> 01:15.616
Oh, I've been working on it
myself last couple years.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.050
I got a Chevelle guy
if you're interested.

01:17.052 --> 01:19.186
He's got a flatbed
and everything.

01:19.188 --> 01:21.188
Really? Good guy?
Oh, the best.

01:21.190 --> 01:22.422
No rip-off.

01:22.424 --> 01:23.957
We should be...
we should be going in.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.226
So, hey,
nice talking with you.

01:26.228 --> 01:27.694
Hey, you know, uh,
Eddie and I,

01:27.696 --> 01:29.162
we're taking my sister
out to dinner tonight.

01:29.164 --> 01:30.197
She came up from Virginia

01:30.199 --> 01:31.832
to go apartment hunting.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.833
Why don't you join us?

01:32.835 --> 01:34.001
Uh, well...

01:34.003 --> 01:35.836
You... um, being
put on the spot.

01:35.838 --> 01:38.438
He probably
has plans, right?

01:38.440 --> 01:39.673
Who has plans
on a Thursday night?

01:39.675 --> 01:40.741
Come on, it'll be great.

01:40.743 --> 01:42.409
Okay.

01:42.411 --> 01:44.778
Yeah? 7:00. Blue Smoke.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.780
All right.
Bye.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.850
I couldn't think of
an excuse fast enough.

01:49.852 --> 01:51.318
If you don't
want me to come...

01:51.320 --> 01:53.587
No, of course, come.

01:53.589 --> 01:54.955
Of course.

01:54.957 --> 01:56.390
It's gonna be great.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.394
Angela's here, sir.

02:06.936 --> 02:08.702
Angela.
Hi, Frank.

02:10.205 --> 02:11.405
Wow.

02:11.407 --> 02:14.141
Sight for sore eyes.
Mm.

02:14.143 --> 02:15.375
Sit with me.

02:15.377 --> 02:16.310
Yeah.

02:16.312 --> 02:17.778
Please.

02:19.548 --> 02:21.014
You look great.

02:21.016 --> 02:22.950
You too.

02:22.952 --> 02:24.451
So how is everybody?

02:24.453 --> 02:25.419
Oh, all good.

02:25.421 --> 02:27.187
I can't believe
it's been,

02:27.189 --> 02:28.789
what, seven years?

02:28.791 --> 02:29.660
At least.

02:29.684 --> 02:31.754
Almost nine years
since Joe...

02:32.828 --> 02:35.262
I go by there on his birthday.

02:35.264 --> 02:36.897
Feels good to remember him.

02:36.899 --> 02:40.801
Thank you for that, Angela.

02:40.803 --> 02:45.572
I wanted you to know
that I'm getting married.

02:45.574 --> 02:49.910
Well, that's wonderful.
Congratulations.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.546
I would love for you
to come to the wedding.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.381
When is it?

02:54.383 --> 02:56.883
A week from tomorrow.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.118
Oh.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.186
I know.

02:59.188 --> 03:01.288
It's short notice.
I, um...

03:01.290 --> 03:02.756
I've been
carrying this around,

03:02.758 --> 03:03.890
wondering should
I send it,

03:03.892 --> 03:07.127
should I drop it off?

03:07.129 --> 03:09.629
I'm glad you dropped it off
in person.

03:09.631 --> 03:11.264
The whole family is invited,

03:11.266 --> 03:13.567
if you want to extend
the invitation.

03:13.569 --> 03:15.569
I always loved that whole gang.

03:15.571 --> 03:19.573
And we love you
and we care about you,

03:19.575 --> 03:21.508
so this guy
better measure up.

03:21.510 --> 03:23.577
Does he have a name?
Steve Quinones.

03:23.579 --> 03:27.447
Detective Steve Quinones,
works narcotics.

03:28.684 --> 03:29.983
You're marrying a cop.

03:29.985 --> 03:33.220
Ugh. I swore I would never
date another one after Joe.

03:33.222 --> 03:37.190
You deserve happiness, Angela.

03:37.192 --> 03:39.059
I mean that.

03:40.529 --> 03:42.295
Thank you, Frank.

03:45.534 --> 03:47.834
I should let you
get back to work.

03:50.406 --> 03:52.572
And I will share
the good news

03:52.574 --> 03:54.674
and the invitation
with the family.

03:54.676 --> 03:56.209
Oh.

03:56.211 --> 03:58.779
I'm so glad
I came to see you.

03:58.781 --> 04:01.081
Oh.

04:01.083 --> 04:03.316
Me too.

04:15.664 --> 04:18.031
Excuse me, Doc.
Detective Reagan and Baez.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.533
We're here to see
the assault victim.

04:19.535 --> 04:20.767
Yeah, Malik Nejjari.

04:20.769 --> 04:22.402
He's right down here.

04:22.404 --> 04:25.105
He won't tell us what happened,
but he's got a fractured radius,

04:25.107 --> 04:29.009
fractured ulna, contusions on
his upper body, front and back,

04:29.011 --> 04:30.510
and two fractured ribs.

04:30.512 --> 04:31.945
This is him.

04:34.716 --> 04:35.916
Nine years old.

04:35.918 --> 04:37.484
And he has lots
of old injuries.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.052
This has been going
on for a while.

04:39.054 --> 04:40.287
You saying he's abused?

04:40.289 --> 04:42.289
There's no other
explanation.

04:42.291 --> 04:43.193
Who called it in?

04:43.217 --> 04:43.991
Third grade teacher.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.726
Noticed he was in so much pain,
he couldn't write his own name.

04:46.728 --> 04:48.228
School called 911.

04:48.964 --> 04:50.197
Yeah.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.999
Hey, Malik.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.936
Detective Reagan.
This is my partner,

04:55.938 --> 04:57.537
Detective Baez.

04:57.539 --> 04:59.239
The shield means that,

04:59.241 --> 05:01.942
if we ask you questions,
you can trust us, okay?

05:03.378 --> 05:05.312
You want to tell us
what happened?

05:07.216 --> 05:08.148
You play sports, Malik?

05:08.150 --> 05:10.283
Baseball.

05:10.285 --> 05:11.251
Second base.

05:11.253 --> 05:13.053
Wow.

05:13.055 --> 05:14.354
You Mets or Yankees?

05:14.356 --> 05:15.655
Mets.

05:15.657 --> 05:16.790
Even after they
choked season?

05:16.792 --> 05:18.658
You still not giving up
on them, huh?

05:18.660 --> 05:21.528
They'll come back.
Oh, okay.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.663
The doctor said
you broke some bones, Malik.

05:26.668 --> 05:28.368
Who's the best pitcher
on the Mets?

05:28.370 --> 05:30.170
Syndergard.

05:30.172 --> 05:31.705
And who's the best hitter
on the Mets?

05:31.707 --> 05:33.106
Cespedes.

05:33.108 --> 05:34.207
Oh, okay.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.209
And who gave you these
breaks and bruises?

05:37.946 --> 05:40.213
How about if you tell me
who did this to you,

05:40.215 --> 05:43.049
I'll tell you who my
favorite player is on the Mets.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.217
Deal?

05:46.788 --> 05:48.755
My dad hit me.

05:48.757 --> 05:50.090
What'd your dad hit you with?

05:51.627 --> 05:53.360
Malik, are you okay?

05:53.362 --> 05:54.561
Why is my son here?

05:54.563 --> 05:56.696
You're his father?
I am.

05:56.698 --> 05:58.532
Great. Why don't the both of you
come outside with us?

05:58.534 --> 05:59.499
I'm not leaving my son.

05:59.501 --> 06:01.168
I'll stay with her.
Good.

06:01.170 --> 06:02.502
Come on.

06:02.504 --> 06:03.470
You hit him?

06:03.472 --> 06:05.172
What's going...
Who are you?

06:05.174 --> 06:06.873
I'm a detective
with the NYPD.

06:06.875 --> 06:07.974
Did you hit your son?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.576
My son is
none of your business.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.644
Well, he is now.

06:10.646 --> 06:12.412
I don't need to
talk to you.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.580
Hey!

06:13.582 --> 06:15.549
What are you...
What are you doing?

06:15.551 --> 06:17.517
Placing you under arrest.
You can't arrest me.

06:17.519 --> 06:18.785
First degree assault...

06:18.787 --> 06:19.545
Ah!

06:19.569 --> 06:21.522
...and endangering
the welfare of a child.

06:21.523 --> 06:23.156
I have diplomatic immunity.

06:23.158 --> 06:24.858
Do you understand?

06:24.860 --> 06:27.093
Yeah, I understand.
Ah!

Hassan Nejjari
is a senior

06:52.365 --> 06:54.465
diplomatic attaché
from Morocco.

06:54.467 --> 06:56.000
I don't care.
Then don't care,

06:56.002 --> 06:57.468
but you do have to
recognize that...

06:57.470 --> 06:58.502
There's no mistaking this

06:58.504 --> 07:00.337
for a trip and fall.

07:00.339 --> 07:02.072
That much I recognize.

07:02.074 --> 07:03.374
Doc said the kid

07:03.376 --> 07:04.508
was hit with an object.

07:04.510 --> 07:06.119
And some of the injuries
are old ones.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.620
Look, the charges are correct.

07:08.622 --> 07:10.322
Assault and endangering
the welfare of a child.

07:10.324 --> 07:12.991
They would be correct if we had
the authority to charge him.

07:12.993 --> 07:14.259
I know how this works, Garrett.

07:14.261 --> 07:16.929
That doesn't mean it's the way
it should work.

07:16.931 --> 07:18.864
Sir, she's here.

07:18.866 --> 07:20.499
Conference room.

07:20.501 --> 07:21.967
Yeah, right on time.

07:21.969 --> 07:23.201
Tread lightly.

07:27.508 --> 07:29.408
Thank you.

07:29.410 --> 07:30.375
Hello.

07:30.377 --> 07:31.577
Commissioner.

07:31.579 --> 07:33.178
This is Christine Sanders,
Deputy Secretary of State.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.514
Garrett Moore,

07:35.516 --> 07:37.015
Deputy Commissioner of
Public Information

07:37.017 --> 07:38.050
and Sid Gormley,

07:38.052 --> 07:39.217
Special Assistant
to the Commissioner.

07:39.219 --> 07:41.653
Pleasure.
Please, sit down.

07:44.992 --> 07:46.925
Well, we know
why I'm here.

07:46.927 --> 07:48.393
You're here because
I asked you here.

07:48.395 --> 07:50.495
Is-Is that how
this is gonna go?

07:50.497 --> 07:52.965
This isn't parking tickets
or a nightclub brawl.

07:52.967 --> 07:55.467
We're talking about
the welfare of a child here.

07:55.469 --> 07:56.868
A child who is not
a U.S. citizen,

07:56.870 --> 07:59.805
and a child whose father
is a foreign diplomat.

07:59.807 --> 08:02.240
Have you looked
at the hospital report?

08:02.242 --> 08:03.809
Sadly, yes.

08:03.811 --> 08:06.078
But it doesn't matter
what the injuries are,

08:06.080 --> 08:08.614
we still have no jurisdiction
to charge this man.

08:08.616 --> 08:10.449
Diplomatic immunity
should not be

08:10.451 --> 08:12.384
a free pass for brutality.

08:12.386 --> 08:13.919
And I have asked
the Moroccan government

08:13.921 --> 08:15.854
to waive immunity.

08:15.856 --> 08:17.856
And if they do, and only then,

08:17.858 --> 08:20.158
can Mr. Nejjari be charged.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.627
Morocco doesn't have strict laws

08:21.629 --> 08:24.396
against corporal punishment.
No.

08:24.398 --> 08:26.732
And there is no “when in Rome”
clause, I'm guessing.

08:26.734 --> 08:28.000
No.

08:28.002 --> 08:29.134
Then what's the morning line

08:29.136 --> 08:30.502
on them handing him over?

08:30.504 --> 08:32.004
We're already getting
flooded with calls

08:32.006 --> 08:33.205
from the press on this case.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.774
We will handle
all press inquiries.

08:35.775 --> 08:37.442
What are the odds?

08:37.443 --> 08:39.811
They're slim, okay?

08:39.813 --> 08:41.947
Then I don't like 'em.

08:41.948 --> 08:46.251
And what you like and don't like
is not really the issue here.

08:46.253 --> 08:48.353
It is to me and the people
of this city. That counts.

08:48.355 --> 08:50.422
Commissioner, you must
release Mr. Nejjari

08:50.424 --> 08:53.525
and void this arrest.

08:53.527 --> 08:55.227
This case is not
your business.

08:55.229 --> 08:57.596
When a child is in danger
in my city,

08:57.598 --> 08:59.064
it is my business.

08:59.066 --> 09:00.699
It's not my fine print.

09:00.701 --> 09:02.300
It's international
policy as sanctioned

09:02.302 --> 09:04.336
by the United States
government.

09:04.338 --> 09:06.405
Now I have reached out
to Morocco

09:06.407 --> 09:09.074
and I am investigating
these charges.

09:09.076 --> 09:11.410
And I will let you know
what comes of it.

09:13.047 --> 09:16.114
How about I conduct my own
investigation

09:16.116 --> 09:19.918
and let you know
what comes of that?

09:30.297 --> 09:32.431
Really?

09:32.433 --> 09:34.499
You're breaking
the law right now.

09:34.501 --> 09:36.802
Oh, we're breaking the law?

09:36.804 --> 09:38.670
You did serious bodily
harm to a child.

09:38.672 --> 09:39.705
Your child!

09:39.707 --> 09:41.506
That's breaking the law.

09:41.508 --> 09:42.474
What did you
hit him with?

09:42.476 --> 09:44.176
I'd like to
speak to a lawyer,

09:44.178 --> 09:46.164
and I'd like the Moroccan
attaché notified immediately.

09:46.165 --> 09:47.914
Well. Well, I'd like to
beat the crap out of you,

09:47.915 --> 09:49.147
but guess what?

09:49.149 --> 09:51.283
Sometimes we don't always
get what we want, do we?

09:51.285 --> 09:52.651
You're going to cause an
international incident,

09:52.653 --> 09:53.852
Detective.

09:53.854 --> 09:56.655
And you're gonna cause
the death of a child!

09:56.657 --> 09:57.856
Write down the names
and numbers of who

09:57.858 --> 10:00.158
you want called
and we'll accommodate you.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.594
Finally, someone who understands
how things work.

10:02.596 --> 10:03.929
Make no mistake,

10:03.931 --> 10:06.465
I do agree with my partner
that you are a piece of crap.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.166
Charming.

10:08.168 --> 10:10.502
Mr. Nejjari, I'm Erin Reagan
with the DA's office.

10:10.504 --> 10:12.304
You will be released shortly.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.939
Thank you.

10:13.941 --> 10:16.908
Can I see you outside?

10:20.314 --> 10:21.546
What the hell
are you doing?

10:21.548 --> 10:23.181
What the hell
are <i>you</i> doing?

10:23.183 --> 10:24.783
You know the guy's
a diplomat.

10:24.785 --> 10:27.219
I know that that guy beat
the hell out of his own son

10:27.221 --> 10:29.921
and broke four bones, and
he's getting a free pass.

10:29.923 --> 10:31.189
My boss asked me
to come down here

10:31.191 --> 10:32.724
and put a lid on it,
personally.

10:32.726 --> 10:34.259
Your boss asked you
to come down

10:34.261 --> 10:35.994
and defend a child abuser.

10:35.996 --> 10:37.462
Come on, Danny, you think
I'm happy about it?

10:37.464 --> 10:38.930
You think I'm not
as mad as you are

10:38.932 --> 10:40.198
that we have to
let this guy go?

10:40.200 --> 10:43.835
D.A.'s office cannot
prosecute a diplomat.

10:43.837 --> 10:45.670
Really? You want I should
show you the pictures

10:45.672 --> 10:47.105
of what he did to his boy?

10:47.107 --> 10:49.875
No, I want you
to release him, now!

10:57.284 --> 11:00.051
You could just say
that you forgot that

11:00.053 --> 11:01.453
you have an appointment.

11:01.455 --> 11:02.888
At 7:00 on a Thursday?

11:02.890 --> 11:04.856
You just said
you don't want to go.

11:04.858 --> 11:06.158
I don't.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.859
Would you just come?

11:07.861 --> 11:09.394
Right, because
it won't be weird,

11:09.396 --> 11:11.663
me tagging along on a date
with you and your boyfriend?

11:11.665 --> 11:13.899
You and I both decided
that we are going to

11:13.901 --> 11:17.202
keep our relationship
professional.

11:17.204 --> 11:18.403
We did.

11:18.405 --> 11:20.205
Then it shouldn't
be weird.

11:20.207 --> 11:22.107
It won't be.
Good.

11:23.610 --> 11:26.545
But I am surprised you're
dating someone like him.

11:26.547 --> 11:28.780
“Someone like him”?
What does that mean?

11:28.782 --> 11:30.182
You know, I just thought
you'd go for someone

11:30.184 --> 11:32.684
more like...
You?

11:33.587 --> 11:34.653
A cop.

11:34.655 --> 11:37.622
Well, in the plus
and minuses,

11:37.624 --> 11:40.659
the fact that he's
not a cop is a plus.

11:40.661 --> 11:42.093
Because...

11:42.095 --> 11:45.363
Because, you know, he doesn't
even know what a “perp” is.

11:45.365 --> 11:47.332
Right. But he likes
you because...

11:47.334 --> 11:50.035
Because who wouldn't?

11:55.909 --> 11:58.443
You think it's a coincidence
they picked an A.D.A.

11:58.445 --> 12:00.078
with the last name
“Reagan” to handle this?

12:00.080 --> 12:01.947
No.
Well, it pisses me off.

12:01.949 --> 12:03.744
Well, that's just
a waste of time.

12:03.768 --> 12:04.483
Why?

12:04.484 --> 12:06.518
Because it's not very smart
to get pissed off

12:06.520 --> 12:08.720
about someone being
smart about something.

12:08.722 --> 12:10.655
I tell you what,
the D.A. expects you

12:10.657 --> 12:11.957
to reign in Danny and me,

12:11.959 --> 12:13.892
we'll just see to it
that you fail.

12:13.894 --> 12:14.860
Yep.

12:14.862 --> 12:17.562
So the only way
I can win is to fail?

12:17.564 --> 12:18.530
Exactly.

12:18.532 --> 12:20.298
Okay, well, guys, legally,

12:20.300 --> 12:23.068
Hassan Nejjari
cannot be charged.

12:23.070 --> 12:24.803
So, legally, we're just
supposed to sit back

12:24.805 --> 12:26.838
and allow a young boy
to get abused?

12:26.840 --> 12:27.873
Not on my watch.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.140
I always thought that

12:29.142 --> 12:31.810
diplomatic immunity
was a crock.

12:31.812 --> 12:33.678
Come on, Grandpa.
What?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.947
The whole Vienna Convention?

12:35.949 --> 12:38.717
Well, maybe not
the whole convention.

12:38.719 --> 12:39.918
Just the loopholes.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.453
Yeah, the loopholes.
I mean, just 'cause

12:41.455 --> 12:43.221
we can't touch the father
doesn't mean

12:43.223 --> 12:45.123
we can't save the boy.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.058
Yeah, but if the D.A.'s office
refuses to prosecute...

12:47.060 --> 12:49.628
“Refuses” implies a choice.

12:49.630 --> 12:51.029
Well?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.330
Our child-protective services

12:52.332 --> 12:55.200
are not bound
by international law.

12:55.202 --> 12:58.036
Is that true?
I'm not sure.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.404
Has it been tested?

12:59.406 --> 13:01.539
I don't know.
I'll find out.

13:01.541 --> 13:02.741
Good.

13:02.743 --> 13:04.876
Well, Ranger home game,
anyone?

13:04.878 --> 13:08.313
Hold on, wait, we've
got one more thing.

13:08.315 --> 13:09.814
Guess who stopped by
my office?

13:10.951 --> 13:12.617
Angela Ferraro.

13:12.619 --> 13:17.055
She asked us to her wedding
next weekend.

13:17.057 --> 13:18.256
Joe's Angela?

13:18.258 --> 13:19.958
Yeah. And you know what?

13:19.960 --> 13:21.293
She's marrying a cop.

13:21.295 --> 13:23.395
I'm so happy for her.

13:23.397 --> 13:24.596
Me, too.

13:24.598 --> 13:26.164
Such a nice girl.

13:26.166 --> 13:29.668
Next weekend, huh?
What?

13:29.670 --> 13:32.671
Well, it's just that
this invite, you know,

13:32.673 --> 13:35.140
it doesn't look like an invite
to a shotgun wedding, does it?

13:35.142 --> 13:36.508
Looks very well-planned.

13:36.510 --> 13:39.444
So why the last-second
invite for us?

13:39.446 --> 13:42.047
Maybe 'cause it's not her idea.

13:42.049 --> 13:43.815
Didn't exactly
wanna go there,

13:43.817 --> 13:45.450
but she is marrying a cop.

13:45.452 --> 13:47.852
So?
So...

13:47.854 --> 13:50.488
it would be a major coup
for a regular old cop

13:50.490 --> 13:52.257
to have the P.C. come
to his wedding.

13:52.259 --> 13:53.045
Well...

13:53.069 --> 13:54.684
I mean, he could
take photos

13:54.685 --> 13:56.562
with all the Reagans
and the P.C.,

13:56.563 --> 13:59.164
and post 'em online, looking
like we're all buddies.

13:59.166 --> 14:02.000
I'm sure his bosses would
sit up and take notice.

14:02.002 --> 14:03.034
You really think so?

14:03.036 --> 14:05.170
I kinda hate myself
for thinking it...

14:05.172 --> 14:06.705
No, it crossed my mind.

14:06.707 --> 14:08.006
It actually didn't just
cross it,

14:08.008 --> 14:10.241
it, uh, pretty well
stuck there.

14:11.278 --> 14:13.778
You really think
we're being played?

14:18.318 --> 14:20.612
What did your father
hit you with?

14:25.058 --> 14:28.626
Malik?

14:28.628 --> 14:29.961
You know, Malik,
I never did tell you

14:29.963 --> 14:31.830
who my favorite
Met player is, did I?

14:31.832 --> 14:33.064
No.

14:33.066 --> 14:34.699
It's David Wright.

14:34.701 --> 14:37.235
Me, too.
Yeah?

14:37.237 --> 14:40.338
You know, it's okay for you
to answer our questions.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.540
What did your father
hit you with?

14:44.611 --> 14:46.745
My baseball bat.

14:47.981 --> 14:50.382
And why
did he hit you?

14:50.384 --> 14:52.517
I forgot
to put the milk away.

14:52.519 --> 14:53.985
Am I in trouble?

14:53.987 --> 14:56.221
No.

14:56.223 --> 14:59.657
You're never in trouble
for telling the truth, buddy.

15:15.008 --> 15:16.608
Hello.
Good evening.

15:21.581 --> 15:23.581
Hi.
Right this way.

15:25.085 --> 15:27.218
Nice to see you.

15:27.220 --> 15:29.054
You, too.
Jamie.

15:29.056 --> 15:31.156
This is my sister,
Caroline.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.157
Hi.

15:32.159 --> 15:34.159
Caroline,
this is Eddie.

15:34.161 --> 15:35.593
It's so nice

15:35.595 --> 15:37.095
to finally meet you.
Eddie!

15:37.097 --> 15:38.563
Have a seat.

15:38.565 --> 15:40.511
Got appetizers,
drinks coming, all that.

15:40.535 --> 15:41.367
Nice.

15:41.368 --> 15:43.601
So, we, uh, we heard you're in
town looking for apartments.

15:43.603 --> 15:45.937
Yes. I cannot believe
how expensive it is.

15:45.939 --> 15:47.205
I could rent
a whole house in Virginia

15:47.207 --> 15:48.740
for what an apartment
here costs.

15:48.742 --> 15:50.475
Yeah, well, where
are you looking?

15:50.477 --> 15:52.911
Park Slope and Tribeca.

15:52.913 --> 15:54.145
Well, no wonder.

15:54.147 --> 15:56.514
Those are two
of the priciest neighborhoods.

15:56.516 --> 15:59.050
Okay, so where
should I look, then?

15:59.052 --> 16:00.718
I live in Brooklyn Heights.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.421
Ooh, that's, like, actually
also very expensive.

16:03.423 --> 16:05.890
You should maybe
think about, um, Jersey.

16:05.892 --> 16:07.659
Jersey?
Jersey?

16:07.661 --> 16:12.397
Okay, dump the whole
register into the bag, now!

16:14.668 --> 16:16.534
Shut up!

16:16.536 --> 16:20.271
Put it in the bag! Do it now!

16:20.273 --> 16:22.273
Get over there!
Move!

16:22.275 --> 16:23.308
Fill the bag!

16:23.310 --> 16:26.177
Stay down
and you won't get hurt!

16:26.179 --> 16:28.379
Come on, hurry up!

16:28.381 --> 16:30.415
Cell phones on the table!

16:30.417 --> 16:31.516
Eddie, you got your gun?

16:31.518 --> 16:33.318
I don't leave home
without it.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.653
I said cell phones on the table!

16:37.157 --> 16:38.590
Okay, you go left,
I'll go right.

16:38.592 --> 16:40.125
Go.
Get down, Eddie.

16:40.127 --> 16:42.393
Stay down.

16:42.395 --> 16:44.262
Put it in the bag!

16:44.264 --> 16:45.697
Don't look at me.

16:45.699 --> 16:49.000
We don't have all day!

16:49.002 --> 16:51.402
Come on!

16:51.404 --> 16:53.304
Hurry it up!

16:54.040 --> 16:55.140
Come on!

16:56.743 --> 16:58.343
Stop!

16:58.345 --> 17:00.512
Oh, my God!
Get back!

17:00.514 --> 17:01.479
Please don't kill me!

17:01.481 --> 17:03.381
I said get back!
Police. Don't move!

17:03.383 --> 17:05.450
Drop the gun
right now!

17:10.957 --> 17:12.056
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em!

17:12.058 --> 17:13.691
Behind your back!
Don't fight me.

17:13.693 --> 17:14.959
Why'd you do that?

17:14.961 --> 17:16.661
We just wanted some money.

17:16.663 --> 17:17.663
Jamie!

17:18.798 --> 17:20.298
Are you okay?

17:20.300 --> 17:21.366
You good?

17:21.367 --> 17:22.634
Yeah.

17:27.148 --> 17:30.284
30 innocent civilians
in a small area,

17:30.286 --> 17:32.152
two perps with loaded weapons,

17:32.154 --> 17:34.187
and you two
successfully apprehended them

17:34.189 --> 17:35.789
with no serious
injuries.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.157
You did everything right.

17:37.159 --> 17:39.526
Thank you, sir.
I'm gonna write this up.

17:39.528 --> 17:41.261
Recommend you both
for a commendation.

17:41.263 --> 17:42.462
Just doing our jobs, boss.

17:42.464 --> 17:44.865
Good work, officers.

17:44.867 --> 17:47.701
Yeah. Good, man.

17:50.039 --> 17:53.473
Oh, my God,
you guys were amazing.

17:53.475 --> 17:55.208
I mean, really,
really amazing.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.444
It was nothing, really.

17:57.446 --> 17:58.979
You took those two robbers
down like it was clockwork.

17:58.981 --> 18:00.714
I've never seen
anything like that.

18:00.716 --> 18:02.115
Are you guys okay?

18:02.117 --> 18:05.319
I mean, my hands are...
they're still shaking.

18:05.321 --> 18:06.687
I was... I was so scared.

18:06.689 --> 18:08.121
I had no idea
what was gonna happen.

18:08.123 --> 18:10.190
Hey, trust me,
we were scared, too.

18:10.192 --> 18:12.159
You would never know.

18:13.128 --> 18:15.762
Well, I feel like I could
use a drink.

18:15.764 --> 18:17.230
Me, too.

18:17.232 --> 18:19.366
I, uh, see, I got to be up
early for work tomorrow,

18:19.368 --> 18:20.801
so it's getting
kind of late.

18:20.803 --> 18:22.469
Sorry, I didn't mean,
like, right now.

18:22.471 --> 18:24.571
We actually have to stay
for a couple more hours

18:24.573 --> 18:25.839
and do some interviews...

18:25.841 --> 18:28.475
- Another time.
- Absolutely.

18:28.477 --> 18:29.843
All right.

18:29.845 --> 18:30.977
Okay.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.679
So I'll be talking to you.

18:34.616 --> 18:36.683
Oh...

18:36.685 --> 18:38.352
It was so nice
to meet you.

18:38.354 --> 18:41.121
- Take care. I mean, thank you.
- You, too.

18:41.123 --> 18:42.656
- And great job.
- Have a good night.

18:42.658 --> 18:43.957
You too.

18:43.959 --> 18:46.193
All right.

18:47.429 --> 18:49.062
Huh.

18:54.203 --> 18:57.571
Welcome back to One PP,
Deputy Secretary.

18:57.573 --> 18:58.772
What is this?

18:58.774 --> 19:01.108
Well, every so often,
I get off on the wrong foot,

19:01.110 --> 19:03.877
especially with my colleagues
from Washington... Please.

19:03.879 --> 19:05.278
I'm not your colleague.

19:05.280 --> 19:09.182
So I try to show
a little extra courtesy

19:09.184 --> 19:10.450
if and when
we meet again.

19:10.452 --> 19:12.085
And how much does that
actually work for you?

19:12.087 --> 19:13.653
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

19:13.655 --> 19:15.722
Thank you, Baker.

19:17.493 --> 19:18.458
I tried.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.227
What do you what?

19:20.229 --> 19:23.630
This case is not in your
jurisdiction, Commissioner.

19:23.632 --> 19:25.198
This city is my jurisdiction.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.333
I know that you were
behind the push

19:26.335 --> 19:27.768
to get Child Services
involved.

19:27.770 --> 19:29.669
To rescue a little boy.

19:29.671 --> 19:31.438
To interfere
in diplomatic protocol.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.073
For the sake of that boy.

19:33.075 --> 19:34.708
Cut the crap!

19:34.710 --> 19:36.843
It's not crap, Ms. Sanders.

19:36.845 --> 19:39.413
You remanded Malik
into foster care?

19:39.415 --> 19:41.481
No, our system did.

19:41.483 --> 19:43.350
And now State has a problem
with the Moroccan government.

19:43.352 --> 19:45.018
That's your business,
deal with it.

19:45.020 --> 19:46.153
Don't come crying to me.

19:46.155 --> 19:48.021
I am dealing with it.

19:48.023 --> 19:50.991
There is a hearing set up
for family court.

19:50.993 --> 19:52.726
They will never uphold
keeping the son

19:52.728 --> 19:53.794
of a foreign diplomat
in foster care,

19:53.796 --> 19:55.395
and you are going
to stay out of it.

19:55.397 --> 19:57.230
I don't take orders from you.

19:57.232 --> 19:58.265
These laws are in place
for a reason.

19:58.267 --> 20:00.300
I do not make the laws,
I uphold them.

20:00.302 --> 20:03.203
And that is exactly what
you are supposed to do, too.

20:03.205 --> 20:05.793
The NYPD Patrol Guide
is 2,200 pages.

20:05.817 --> 20:06.641
So?

20:06.642 --> 20:08.942
So it lays out
every single scenario

20:08.944 --> 20:10.911
that could possibly
happen on the job,

20:10.913 --> 20:12.012
to set protocol.

20:12.014 --> 20:13.480
This is not police business.

20:13.482 --> 20:15.515
That is <i>exactly</i> what it is.

20:15.517 --> 20:18.885
A minor in the confines
of our precincts

20:18.887 --> 20:21.755
is being serially abused
by an adult

20:21.757 --> 20:23.657
who is charged with his care.

20:23.659 --> 20:27.093
Is that as wide as your thinking
can go? Your precinct?

20:27.095 --> 20:31.398
Well, it is a much bigger world
out there, Commissioner Reagan.

20:32.267 --> 20:35.602
I think your work is done here.

20:35.604 --> 20:37.571
You're throwing me out?

20:37.573 --> 20:40.707
I'm asking you to leave.
This is one of those ones

20:40.709 --> 20:43.510
where we're going to have
to agree to disagree.

20:43.512 --> 20:46.947
Well, I'm not agreeing
to anything.

20:46.949 --> 20:49.783
Then please, just leave.

21:07.536 --> 21:09.369
Who keeps texting you?

21:11.206 --> 21:12.539
Uh, Caroline.

21:12.541 --> 21:14.708
Oh...

21:14.710 --> 21:15.976
She interested in you?

21:15.978 --> 21:18.778
I don't know. I haven't
known her that long yet.

21:18.780 --> 21:21.581
But I think
the incident last night

21:21.583 --> 21:23.216
really got to her.

21:23.218 --> 21:25.018
Got to her how?
Well, we deal with this stuff

21:25.020 --> 21:28.555
all the time, but people like
that, like, Josh and his sister,

21:28.557 --> 21:30.524
you know, they're pretty shocked
when they see someone

21:30.526 --> 21:32.192
pull out a gun
and threaten people.

21:32.194 --> 21:33.393
It's not like they saw anything.

21:33.395 --> 21:35.595
They were too busy cowering
under the table.

21:35.597 --> 21:37.063
What did Josh say about it?

21:37.065 --> 21:39.132
Gotten radio silence
from him since it happened.

21:39.134 --> 21:40.700
Did you reach out to him?

21:40.702 --> 21:41.935
Twice.

21:41.937 --> 21:43.270
Oh.

21:43.272 --> 21:44.738
Oh?

21:44.740 --> 21:45.972
What does that mean?

21:45.974 --> 21:48.108
Uh, maybe he's busy,
or maybe he's...

21:48.110 --> 21:50.277
just processing the whole thing.

21:50.279 --> 21:53.179
Caroline doesn't seem to be
having a problem processing.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.815
She just thinks
that you're a hero.

21:55.817 --> 21:58.485
I'm sure Josh
thinks you're a hero, too.

21:58.487 --> 22:01.655
Then why haven't
I heard from him?

22:04.526 --> 22:06.826
Because he's a guy.

22:06.828 --> 22:09.462
It's a little
intimidating, as a guy,

22:09.464 --> 22:11.431
to watch your date
pull out a gun

22:11.433 --> 22:13.833
and shoot an armed perp
right in front of you.

22:13.835 --> 22:15.535
It's not like
he was trying to help,

22:15.537 --> 22:18.271
or... or get involved
or anything.

22:18.273 --> 22:20.173
He had no gun
and no training, Eddie.

22:20.175 --> 22:21.508
What did you want him to do?

22:21.510 --> 22:24.077
Swoon over me,

22:24.079 --> 22:28.014
like Caroline seems
to be doing with you.

22:33.155 --> 22:35.422
There's a good chance
Child Services

22:35.424 --> 22:37.023
is gonna release him
back to his parents.

22:37.025 --> 22:39.092
Wait. Hold on.
You came all the way down here

22:39.094 --> 22:40.260
just to tell us that?

22:40.262 --> 22:41.528
Well, right now,

22:41.530 --> 22:43.997
the only person saying Malik
is being abused is Malik.

22:43.999 --> 22:46.433
Uh, hello.
And the history of injuries.

22:46.435 --> 22:48.368
A history of injuries can't
be attributed to the father

22:48.370 --> 22:49.736
without some corroboration.

22:49.738 --> 22:51.671
So, we got to find somebody
to confirm Malik's story?

22:51.673 --> 22:53.773
Otherwise the parents can say
he sustained those injuries

22:53.775 --> 22:55.809
in any number of ways, - I get it.
and because Child Services...

22:55.811 --> 22:57.911
...can't enter the apartment...
I get it!

22:58.714 --> 23:00.580
We could talk to the school.

23:00.582 --> 23:02.148
School's always gonna side
with Child Protective Services.

23:02.150 --> 23:04.618
The only person left
is the mother.

23:04.620 --> 23:05.719
Coming from
that culture,

23:05.721 --> 23:06.686
you really think

23:06.688 --> 23:07.854
she'll contradict her husband?

23:07.856 --> 23:10.490
No. But what other choice
do we have?

23:10.492 --> 23:11.992
Thanks.

23:15.397 --> 23:17.897
Excuse me. Detectives
Reagan and Baez.

23:17.899 --> 23:20.300
Need to ask you a few questions
about the Nejjari family.

23:20.302 --> 23:22.335
You know what makes
a good doorman?

23:22.337 --> 23:23.603
You hold the door?

23:23.605 --> 23:26.106
And hail cabs,
and collect packages.

23:26.108 --> 23:27.941
And keep your mouth shut.

23:27.943 --> 23:29.609
Well, you know what
makes a good cop?

23:29.611 --> 23:31.611
Getting people to talk
when they don't want want to.

23:31.613 --> 23:32.912
Look, I've only been here
six months,

23:32.914 --> 23:34.414
buddy, I don't
want to lose my job.

23:34.416 --> 23:36.750
Hey, <i>buddy.</i> We don't want
to lose the nine-year-old kid

23:36.752 --> 23:39.252
who was almost beaten to death
by his father.

23:39.254 --> 23:42.255
Malik's a nice kid.

23:42.257 --> 23:45.191
A nice kid with bruises, welts
and fractures all over his body.

23:45.193 --> 23:46.926
Hey, what do you want from me?
What do we want from you?

23:46.928 --> 23:49.429
We want you to stop obstructing

23:49.431 --> 23:51.231
our investigation.

23:51.233 --> 23:52.666
Now, have you
ever seen him

23:52.668 --> 23:54.267
abuse that boy?

23:54.269 --> 23:56.536
No.

23:56.538 --> 23:59.606
But the wife--
that's another story.

23:59.608 --> 24:01.274
He hits his wife?

24:01.276 --> 24:03.309
Look, I've seen her come home
all happy, and smiling,

24:03.311 --> 24:05.645
and come out of her apartment
an hour later with a shiner.

24:05.647 --> 24:07.047
There's always yelling
coming from their place.

24:07.049 --> 24:09.149
Anybody ever call the cops?

24:09.151 --> 24:11.451
Hell, yeah! Neighbors called.
Police came.

24:11.453 --> 24:12.752
Guess what happened.

24:12.754 --> 24:14.220
Nothing.

24:14.222 --> 24:17.257
'Cause we all know he's got
that get out of jail free card.

24:17.259 --> 24:18.491
Hey.

24:18.493 --> 24:20.360
Let me know
where I can get one of those.

24:20.362 --> 24:22.529
Buddy, you just got one.

24:24.199 --> 24:26.266
Well, I found out what the smell

24:26.268 --> 24:27.767
in the back of the car was.

24:27.769 --> 24:29.569
Turns out Maldonado picked
up a drunk last night.

24:29.571 --> 24:31.271
Don't even tell me anymore...
And then...

24:36.078 --> 24:37.410
I'll see you tomorrow?
Yeah.

24:37.412 --> 24:38.778
Okay.

24:42.084 --> 24:43.216
Well.

24:44.319 --> 24:46.019
Where've you been?

24:46.021 --> 24:50.123
Haven't responded to any
of my texts or calls...

24:50.125 --> 24:51.691
I, uh... I didn't know
what to say.

24:51.693 --> 24:53.760
About what happened
in the restaurant last night?

24:53.762 --> 24:57.163
Yeah. It just...
it really rocked me, Eddie.

24:57.165 --> 24:59.099
Yeah. It really rocked me, too.

24:59.101 --> 25:01.167
But it didn't make me
want to break off

25:01.169 --> 25:02.702
all communication with you.

25:02.704 --> 25:04.304
I didn't mean to break off
all communication,

25:04.306 --> 25:06.606
I just... I had to figure out
how I was feeling.

25:06.608 --> 25:08.274
Feeling...

25:08.276 --> 25:10.643
about what?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.848
I was doing my job, Josh.

25:14.850 --> 25:16.683
Right. Yeah. You shot someone,

25:16.685 --> 25:18.685
and you could've been shot.

25:18.687 --> 25:20.720
It's kind of how it works.

25:20.722 --> 25:22.822
Would you have preferred
if I had just done

25:22.824 --> 25:24.491
a little duck and cover?

25:24.493 --> 25:26.726
You mean like me?

25:26.728 --> 25:28.361
Whoa. That's...

25:28.363 --> 25:30.029
That is not
what I was gonna say.

25:30.031 --> 25:31.498
Yeah. But that's
what you're thinking.

25:31.500 --> 25:32.966
I didn't expect anything.

25:32.968 --> 25:35.168
I haven't been able to sleep.

25:35.170 --> 25:37.237
That's...

25:37.239 --> 25:38.366
normal.

25:38.367 --> 25:39.383
Nothing about
that's normal.

25:39.384 --> 25:41.609
Eddie, come on. Stop talking
about it like it was.

25:41.610 --> 25:43.610
You knew I was a cop
when you started dating me.

25:43.612 --> 25:46.045
Yeah, I knew, I guess I just...

25:46.047 --> 25:47.881
I didn't realize
what that meant.

25:47.883 --> 25:50.150
What does that mean?

25:50.152 --> 25:53.052
This isn't for me, Eddie.

25:53.054 --> 25:55.722
I don't understand.

25:55.724 --> 25:58.625
I don't, uh...

25:58.627 --> 26:01.161
I don't want to go out
with you anymore.

26:03.198 --> 26:05.365
I'm sorry.

26:20.992 --> 26:22.725
Hey, Sarge.

26:22.727 --> 26:24.861
Walked up on these
two slugging it out.

26:24.863 --> 26:26.796
This one pulled a knife,

26:26.798 --> 26:29.399
but, uh, he didn't use it.

26:29.401 --> 26:32.001
Whoa, hold it. The dynamic
duo are at it again.

26:32.003 --> 26:33.857
We have injuries
to both parties.

26:33.858 --> 26:34.368
All right.

26:34.372 --> 26:36.339
We'll do cross complaints on
the assaults, and hit this guy

26:36.341 --> 26:38.141
with additional menacing

26:38.143 --> 26:39.309
and criminal possession
of a weapon.

26:39.311 --> 26:41.978
Wow. Two felony collars
in the past two days.

26:41.980 --> 26:43.513
Look at you, Janko.

26:43.515 --> 26:45.381
You're a man-eater.

26:45.383 --> 26:46.716
Just shut your face, Maldonado.

26:46.718 --> 26:48.184
Hey, I'm... just kidding around.

26:48.186 --> 26:49.385
Yeah, well, don't.

26:49.387 --> 26:50.520
Take it easy, all right?

26:50.522 --> 26:52.021
Hey, you take it easy,
Maldonado.

26:52.023 --> 26:53.556
I don't need your help.

26:53.558 --> 26:54.724
Would you back off?

26:56.161 --> 26:58.361
Back off!

27:11.109 --> 27:13.042
Ms. Nejjari.

27:13.044 --> 27:14.277
Did something happen to Malik?

27:14.279 --> 27:16.546
Malik is fine. We just
came to talk to you.

27:16.548 --> 27:18.548
I don't think
I should be talking to you.

27:18.550 --> 27:21.284
Well, how about we talk
and you just listen, okay?

27:21.286 --> 27:22.852
Where did you get this?

27:22.854 --> 27:23.987
You called 911.

27:23.989 --> 27:25.188
That was voided.

27:25.190 --> 27:26.789
Yeah. But the record's
still there, which means

27:26.791 --> 27:28.891
we can open the case
any time we want.

27:28.893 --> 27:30.193
Why are you doing this?

27:30.195 --> 27:32.362
You know my husband
can't be charged.

27:32.364 --> 27:33.730
Maybe we could use it
to prove that Malik

27:33.732 --> 27:35.365
shouldn't be returned
to his father.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.967
I can't live without my son.
He's all I have.

27:37.969 --> 27:39.002
Well then, you could
seek asylum, and you

27:39.004 --> 27:40.370
and your son could
both stay here.

27:40.372 --> 27:41.871
You say that like it's so easy.

27:41.873 --> 27:43.306
It <i>can</i> be easy.

27:43.308 --> 27:45.541
Do you know what my husband
would do to me

27:45.543 --> 27:47.310
if I went against him
in this way?

27:47.312 --> 27:48.645
All the more reason.

27:48.647 --> 27:51.648
I tried once before,
to get away from him.

27:51.650 --> 27:53.249
We could protect you.

27:53.251 --> 27:54.217
Really?

27:54.219 --> 27:55.585
Yeah, really.

27:55.587 --> 27:56.986
You can't arrest
or charge my husband,

27:56.988 --> 27:58.655
but you're going to protect me?

28:22.347 --> 28:23.813
Gonna tell me what's going on?

28:23.815 --> 28:25.448
There's nothing going on.

28:25.450 --> 28:27.250
Usually when Maldonado
mouths off

28:27.252 --> 28:29.218
you put him in his place
with a wink and a smile.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.355
Is that what women are supposed
to do, Jamie? Wink and smile?

28:32.357 --> 28:34.724
No. It's... It's an expression.
I just mean,

28:34.726 --> 28:37.160
you can usually defuse
the situation without getting...

28:37.162 --> 28:39.128
Without getting emotional?
Is that what you were gonna say?

28:39.130 --> 28:40.730
I was gonna say
bent out of shape.

28:40.732 --> 28:42.732
Eddie, I'm just trying
to find a way to help.

28:42.734 --> 28:45.635
What is it, exactly, that
you want to help me with, Jamie?

28:45.637 --> 28:47.370
With whatever's bothering you.

28:47.372 --> 28:50.707
Well, you can't help me,
because apparently the problem

28:50.709 --> 28:52.942
is that I don't have a penis.

28:54.479 --> 28:55.945
Is that funny?

28:55.947 --> 28:57.980
No.

28:57.982 --> 28:59.749
Because if I had a penis,
it would be all right

28:59.751 --> 29:02.151
that I took out
two armed robbers.

29:02.153 --> 29:04.053
No. No, no. It wouldn't be
all right. It would be

29:04.055 --> 29:05.755
more than all right.
It would be applauded.

29:05.757 --> 29:08.758
And I would be getting phone
calls and texts from Josh,

29:08.760 --> 29:11.260
looking to hook up,
because he would be so turned on

29:11.262 --> 29:14.263
that I was so heroic
and brave and awesome.

29:14.265 --> 29:16.265
But I don't
have a penis,

29:16.267 --> 29:18.901
so when I take out
two armed perps,

29:18.903 --> 29:22.138
it's an assault
on my date's manhood.

29:24.209 --> 29:26.175
If it's any consolation,

29:26.177 --> 29:29.212
I think that
what you did was brave

29:29.214 --> 29:31.347
and heroic and awesome.

29:31.349 --> 29:33.816
Yeah. Because you're my partner.

29:33.818 --> 29:35.318
You're not my boyfriend.

29:35.320 --> 29:37.687
But if you were
my boyfriend,

29:37.689 --> 29:39.355
you would feel emasculated,

29:39.357 --> 29:42.325
because chicks, we're not
supposed to be the heroes,

29:42.327 --> 29:44.827
we're supposed
to be the damsels in distress,

29:44.829 --> 29:47.029
waiting to be rescued
by guys like you,

29:47.031 --> 29:48.464
not the ones doing the rescuing.

29:48.466 --> 29:51.801
Well, I think some guys would
be turned on by what you did.

29:53.805 --> 29:56.773
Look. Hey. Let's...

29:56.775 --> 29:59.075
go out for drinks,
we'll throw darts

29:59.077 --> 30:00.777
at his picture...

30:00.779 --> 30:03.212
...and we'll move on.
What do you say?

30:05.517 --> 30:07.016
No thanks.

30:08.052 --> 30:09.752
We can't keep being

30:09.754 --> 30:11.988
each other's consolation prize,
Jamie.

30:14.225 --> 30:17.427
I think I need to be alone.

30:29.340 --> 30:31.707
Mmm, the quiche
is delicious, Pop.

30:31.709 --> 30:32.875
Thank you.

30:32.877 --> 30:34.477
Thought real men
don't each quiche.

30:34.479 --> 30:37.046
You can call it bacon,
egg and cheese pie.

30:37.048 --> 30:39.849
Real men don't say,
“Real men don't eat quiche.”

30:39.851 --> 30:40.817
Oh, boy.

30:40.819 --> 30:42.185
Why? What's wrong with it?

30:42.187 --> 30:43.519
It's considered sexist.

30:43.521 --> 30:45.121
Hey.

30:45.123 --> 30:47.490
Save the name calling for
campus, not at this table.

30:47.492 --> 30:48.491
Thank you.

30:48.493 --> 30:50.493
You're welcome, and, actually,

30:50.495 --> 30:52.929
<i>Real Men Don't Eat Quiche</i>
is a title of a book

30:52.931 --> 30:56.365
that pokes fun at male
stereotypes like that one.

30:56.367 --> 30:58.468
So, Dad was
just being meta?

30:58.470 --> 31:00.670
Exactly.
Being what?

31:00.672 --> 31:02.405
Never mind.

31:02.407 --> 31:03.473
Yeah, well,
that book might be

31:03.475 --> 31:04.707
from the '80s,
but stereotypes

31:04.709 --> 31:06.542
like that, I think,
are alive and well.

31:06.544 --> 31:08.377
How's that?

31:08.379 --> 31:09.846
Eddie's new boyfriend
just broke up with her

31:09.848 --> 31:11.280
because of the takedown
at the restaurant.

31:11.282 --> 31:13.049
He couldn't handle the fact
that she was a cop.

31:13.051 --> 31:14.951
Didn't he already
know she was a cop?

31:14.953 --> 31:16.719
He knew, but it's more like

31:16.721 --> 31:18.821
she's a woman who carries a gun
and knows how to use it,

31:18.823 --> 31:21.791
and once he saw it
actually in action...

31:21.793 --> 31:23.726
it made him shrivel up.

31:23.728 --> 31:25.027
Hmm.

31:25.029 --> 31:26.529
Oh, but that wouldn't
bother you, you're saying?

31:26.531 --> 31:27.797
No.

31:27.799 --> 31:29.265
So, there's no line of
work that if the woman

31:29.267 --> 31:31.968
you were attracted to were in,
that would put you off her?

31:31.970 --> 31:34.871
Cesspool cleaner or undertaker.

31:34.873 --> 31:36.272
I'm serious.

31:36.274 --> 31:37.373
So am I.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.908
Ah, come on.

31:38.910 --> 31:39.942
What?

31:39.944 --> 31:40.943
You know, this actually

31:40.945 --> 31:43.012
already happened
to your Uncle Jamie...

31:43.014 --> 31:44.714
only in reverse.

31:44.716 --> 31:45.815
It did?
Yeah.

31:45.817 --> 31:47.149
With the...
Sidney.

31:47.151 --> 31:48.150
Sidney.

31:48.152 --> 31:49.218
Ah.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.087
No.
Yeah.

31:51.089 --> 31:53.155
Your fiancée?
I never said that...

31:53.157 --> 31:54.156
Oh, you did, too,

31:54.158 --> 31:55.191
after about five scotches

31:55.193 --> 31:56.626
at PJ Clarke's that night.

31:57.896 --> 32:00.763
Okay, can we just... move on?

32:00.765 --> 32:03.366
Okay. Your call,
but it goes to your point.

32:03.368 --> 32:06.569
Okay, yeah. Sidney had a problem
with it when I decided

32:06.571 --> 32:08.671
that I was gonna be a cop
instead of a lawyer.

32:08.673 --> 32:11.073
That's not about gender.

32:11.075 --> 32:12.942
It's about how you see
your reflection

32:12.944 --> 32:15.144
in the person you're with.

32:15.146 --> 32:16.412
But gender can be a trigger.

32:16.414 --> 32:18.414
Nicky,
have you ever been

32:18.416 --> 32:22.618
made to feel different
or less important in this family

32:22.620 --> 32:24.487
because you're female?

32:24.489 --> 32:26.255
Well... no.

32:26.257 --> 32:28.958
Good, 'cause this is
and always will be

32:28.960 --> 32:31.227
an equal-opportunity family,

32:31.229 --> 32:33.462
and I will throw quiche
and a hissy fit

32:33.464 --> 32:35.731
at anyone who says otherwise.

32:35.733 --> 32:38.434
Hear, hear.

32:46.010 --> 32:47.443
Anything?

32:47.445 --> 32:48.678
It's still going.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.047
Malik gave a
heartbreaking testimony.

32:52.216 --> 32:54.917
Ay, yai, yai.

32:54.919 --> 32:56.085
You know, when I
was Malik's age,

32:56.087 --> 32:57.186
the only thing
I was afraid of

32:57.188 --> 32:59.221
was striking out
in Little League.

32:59.223 --> 33:01.290
Makes you realize
how lucky we were.

33:01.292 --> 33:03.459
Yeah.

33:04.896 --> 33:09.365
So, what are your thoughts
about this whole wedding thing?

33:10.234 --> 33:11.701
Feels a little weird.

33:11.703 --> 33:14.403
Weird, yeah. I'll say.

33:14.405 --> 33:16.539
The what ifs.

33:16.541 --> 33:19.141
Joe told me he
wanted to get married

33:19.143 --> 33:20.843
at Saint Patrick's Cathedral,

33:20.845 --> 33:22.845
bagpipes and the
whole nine yards.

33:22.847 --> 33:24.547
He told you that?
Yeah.

33:24.549 --> 33:27.283
Wow. He was
always so low-key.

33:27.285 --> 33:29.819
Yeah, except
for celebrations.

33:29.821 --> 33:32.221
My birthday, he was always
the first one to call.

33:32.223 --> 33:33.389
Even before Mom and Dad?

33:33.391 --> 33:34.357
Yeah, at 6:00 a.m.

33:34.359 --> 33:36.158
He always wanted
to beat them to it.

33:36.160 --> 33:39.061
He used to always call me
at 5:00 a.m. on my birthday.

33:39.063 --> 33:41.631
I thought he was just
doing it to annoy me.

33:41.633 --> 33:43.566
Well, you guys were always
competing against each other.

33:43.568 --> 33:44.567
Yeah.

33:44.569 --> 33:45.968
But I still wake up

33:45.970 --> 33:49.205
at 5:00 a.m.
on every birthday.

33:49.207 --> 33:51.040
And that's why I
know the real reason

33:51.042 --> 33:53.943
you guys are being all cynical
about this wedding invite.

33:53.945 --> 33:56.445
Why?

33:56.447 --> 33:58.014
It's not just
that you're jaded.

33:58.016 --> 34:01.150
It's... that it's
a lot more painful

34:01.152 --> 34:03.719
if you believe it's
actually sincere.

34:03.721 --> 34:05.988
You're overthinking it.
Mm.

34:05.990 --> 34:07.523
Look, how much longer
do we got to wait

34:07.525 --> 34:08.491
on this thing, anyway?

34:08.493 --> 34:11.092
A psychologist is
on the stand,

34:11.094 --> 34:12.995
testifying that Malik
is too traumatized

34:12.996 --> 34:14.096
to return to his father.

34:26.143 --> 34:29.210
The judge ruled that Malik
is to stay in foster care

34:29.213 --> 34:32.415
until such time
as it is safe

34:32.417 --> 34:33.649
to be reunited with his parents.

34:33.650 --> 34:35.251
That's good.

34:35.253 --> 34:37.620
For who?

34:44.762 --> 34:46.661
You know I love you

34:46.664 --> 34:47.996
more than anything.

34:47.998 --> 34:50.331
Then stay with me, please.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.400
We can't, Malik.

34:53.237 --> 34:54.704
Hey.

34:54.706 --> 34:57.005
We'll be together soon.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.240
In the meantime,

34:58.242 --> 35:02.678
I want you to be
a very good boy for me. Okay?

35:12.623 --> 35:14.290
Okay.

35:21.966 --> 35:24.600
I hope you're happy.

35:44.826 --> 35:47.257
I'm so sorry
to bother you again.

35:47.258 --> 35:49.892
Oh, no. I-I'm sorry.
I haven't replied.

35:49.894 --> 35:53.062
N... no, I can only imagine
what you must have thought.

35:54.299 --> 35:56.999
I apologize for the invitation.

35:57.001 --> 35:58.434
Apologize?

35:58.436 --> 36:01.604
Yes. I really overstepped.

36:01.606 --> 36:03.406
I... Steve and I

36:03.408 --> 36:04.874
were going over
the final numbers,

36:04.876 --> 36:06.809
and I realized I hadn't
heard back from you,

36:06.811 --> 36:10.046
and when I told him, he blew up.

36:10.048 --> 36:11.581
About what?

36:11.583 --> 36:14.584
That I'd asked you
to the wedding.

36:15.720 --> 36:17.753
He said it would
look like you were invited

36:17.755 --> 36:19.422
to feather his nest,

36:19.424 --> 36:20.857
that you were smart,

36:20.859 --> 36:22.758
and you'd see
right through that.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.894
He said that?
I know you don't

36:24.896 --> 36:28.231
know Steve, but he would never
in a million years

36:28.233 --> 36:29.799
try to pull something like that.

36:29.801 --> 36:32.768
And never in a million years
would I think that.

36:32.770 --> 36:34.737
Thank you for being kind.

36:34.739 --> 36:36.239
I'm not being kind.

36:36.241 --> 36:39.742
You and your family
meant so much to me,

36:39.744 --> 36:43.579
and in an odd way, I guess I was
just looking for your blessing.

36:45.016 --> 36:46.916
And you have it, always.

36:46.918 --> 36:49.185
Well, you're off the hook.

36:49.187 --> 36:51.354
And I am so sorry

36:51.356 --> 36:53.189
to have put you
in that position.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.439
The car's just up here.

37:10.441 --> 37:11.507
Hey.

37:11.509 --> 37:13.242
What are you two doing here?

37:13.244 --> 37:14.777
Making sure he
gets on that plane,

37:14.779 --> 37:15.811
that's what we're doing here.

37:15.813 --> 37:16.913
That won't be necessary.

37:16.915 --> 37:17.914
This was our case.

37:17.916 --> 37:21.017
And now we'll
take it from here.

37:21.019 --> 37:22.685
Your flight
departs at 12:45 from...

37:22.687 --> 37:24.553
Hassan!

37:24.555 --> 37:26.222
Gun!

37:29.961 --> 37:32.194
- Grab her!
- 5-4 detectives to Central.

37:32.196 --> 37:34.730
Requesting a bus forthwith
to ACS. I've got a man shot.

37:34.732 --> 37:36.165
You're under arrest for...
You can't arrest me.

37:36.167 --> 37:37.633
What are you talking about?
She's right.

37:37.635 --> 37:38.968
She just shot this guy.

37:38.970 --> 37:40.836
He's DOA.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.340
I have diplomatic immunity.

37:44.342 --> 37:46.876
And that bag is
my diplomatic pouch.

37:46.878 --> 37:49.378
By law, you must
give it back to me.

37:49.380 --> 37:51.547
She's right.
Can't search the bag.

37:51.549 --> 37:53.749
Can't even charge her
with anything.

37:56.988 --> 37:59.355
You should've just
beat him with a bat.

38:10.535 --> 38:12.535
Yeah?

38:12.537 --> 38:14.837
Hey.

38:15.673 --> 38:18.607
Whoa, this is a first.

38:18.609 --> 38:19.942
Notice I knocked.

38:19.944 --> 38:21.210
Noted.

38:21.212 --> 38:24.180
Not as nice as
the men's locker room, right?

38:24.182 --> 38:25.781
Didn't this used to
be the broom closet?

38:25.783 --> 38:28.217
That figures.

38:30.221 --> 38:32.254
Eddie, I've been thinking
about what you said,

38:32.256 --> 38:33.422
and the thing is...

38:33.424 --> 38:36.392
you've never been
a consolation prize.

38:37.762 --> 38:39.562
Certainly not for me.

38:39.564 --> 38:43.532
Yeah, I know. I was just
really pissed and disappointed.

38:43.534 --> 38:45.801
And I think you're reading
this whole thing wrong.

38:45.803 --> 38:47.837
Really? You think I'm reading
this whole thing wrong?

38:47.839 --> 38:50.873
Yeah, Josh and Caroline
aren't the crazy ones.

38:50.875 --> 38:52.742
Thing is, we're the crazy ones.

38:52.744 --> 38:54.443
We're the ones that run

38:54.445 --> 38:57.980
into danger when everyone else,
all normal people, run away.

38:57.982 --> 39:01.250
And you don't need to make
apologies for who you are

39:01.252 --> 39:02.418
or what you do for a living

39:02.420 --> 39:05.888
because who you are
is really great,

39:05.890 --> 39:07.523
and if Josh doesn't
see that, then...

39:07.525 --> 39:10.326
he doesn't deserve you.

39:12.630 --> 39:14.897
You're right. He doesn't.

39:14.899 --> 39:16.565
I didn't like his car, anyway.

39:16.567 --> 39:17.900
I don't like his beard.

39:17.902 --> 39:19.402
Hipster written all over it.

39:19.404 --> 39:21.670
Who wants a hot hipster
with cool wheels?

39:21.672 --> 39:22.671
Not you.

39:22.673 --> 39:23.939
No.

39:23.941 --> 39:25.775
And that's why I got you...

39:26.611 --> 39:28.677
...a real consolation prize.

39:28.679 --> 39:31.180
Whoa.

39:35.453 --> 39:37.420
“I kick ass”?
You do,

39:37.422 --> 39:39.255
and you should be proud
that you do,

39:39.257 --> 39:42.358
and anyone who ends up being
your boyfriend should, too.

39:44.562 --> 39:45.661
Wow.

39:45.663 --> 39:47.163
You're never gonna wear that,
are you?

39:47.165 --> 39:48.898
No.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.433
Okay. Do you want to go
to the Fireside?

39:50.435 --> 39:52.501
Yes. It's, uh,
it's ladies night.

39:52.503 --> 39:55.137
Would the lady
like some company?

39:55.139 --> 39:57.206
She would.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.375
Hey, thank you.

39:59.377 --> 40:00.509
Ah, don't get
all girly on me.

40:00.511 --> 40:01.911
Oh, tough guy.

40:07.919 --> 40:09.151
We waiting for Pop?

40:09.153 --> 40:11.587
He's already here and
probably mad we're late.

40:11.589 --> 40:13.489
It's that whole theory
about this guy wanting us

40:13.491 --> 40:15.424
at his wedding
'cause he's a cop is...

40:15.426 --> 40:17.193
- You guys were all wrong.
- Yeah.

40:17.195 --> 40:19.028
You're so suspicious
of everyone.

40:19.030 --> 40:20.062
It's a cop thing.

40:20.064 --> 40:21.197
It's a Reagan thing.

40:21.199 --> 40:23.165
Here's an idea,
how about we just celebrate

40:23.167 --> 40:25.968
something good happening
to somebody we care about?

40:31.709 --> 40:34.643
Come on, let's go.
