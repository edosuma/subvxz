WEBVTT

00:00.542 --> 00:02.210
Chief Boden.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.629
Donna Robbins,
from the fire a few days ago?

00:05.381 --> 00:06.673
Thanks again for all that you did.

00:09.218 --> 00:11.219
I want to ask your sister out.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.430
- Do I have your permission?
- Sure.

00:15.474 --> 00:18.935
- What's your problem?
- Hey! Matt! Stop!

00:19.061 --> 00:21.771
That was not you, last night.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.609
If we're gonna do this,
you need to be honest with me.

00:26.735 --> 00:28.111
I'm fine.

00:44.294 --> 00:47.588
Hey, I, uh... I just got a text
from my guy down at the dock.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.716
Looks like those hinges
you ordered finally came in.

00:49.842 --> 00:52.760
- Should keep us on schedule.
- Great.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.805
Hey, how you feeling?

00:57.057 --> 01:00.059
I can honestly say
this is the first day I've felt 100%.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.311
Glad to hear it.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.738
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11.864 --> 01:14.866
I was hoping I could talk to you
for a second. Um, I need some advice.

01:14.992 --> 01:17.535
- What did Otis do?
- It's not that.

01:17.661 --> 01:18.828
Good.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.750
What's going on?

01:25.711 --> 01:30.131
Uh, so, my boss is opening
a new restaurant in New York

01:30.257 --> 01:33.885
and he wanted me
to go to help set it up.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.429
- Great.
- Permanently.

01:38.599 --> 01:39.766
Permanently?

01:41.643 --> 01:46.022
- Sounds like a great opportunity.
- It is. Yeah, it is. It's just...

01:47.566 --> 01:50.568
You and I are working
on this brother-sister thing.

01:50.694 --> 01:54.655
And I just started seeing Brian,
who is incredible to me.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.285
And if I want this...

02:00.621 --> 02:01.954
Am I being Benny?

02:03.248 --> 02:07.877
Katie, no. No! Hey. Not at all.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.593
Glad to see I can leave 51

02:15.719 --> 02:18.137
and everything's gonna be
just where I left it when I get back.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.765
- It has been a slow shift.
- We've only gone out twice.

02:20.933 --> 02:24.477
Be glad. It is cold as hell out there.
Uh, you guys seen Otis and Herrmann?

02:24.603 --> 02:26.687
Inside. Come on, dog.

02:29.942 --> 02:34.904
- Oh, my God. What is that smell?
- Impending gastric distress.

02:35.030 --> 02:38.241
- Ha, ha. Very funny.
- Cruz is cooking? Since when?

02:38.367 --> 02:41.869
Since Mills jumped to Squad and we
haven't gotten a replacement candidate.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.622
- We all drew straws.
- We all lost.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.208
Hey! This is authentic
Dominican cuisine, all right?

02:47.334 --> 02:49.418
Just because you can't
appreciate the aroma

02:49.545 --> 02:52.129
doesn't mean that the taste
isn't gonna blow your hair back, huh?

02:52.256 --> 02:53.923
Just gotta broaden
your horizons a little.

02:54.049 --> 02:57.009
Yeah, broaden them all the way
to Manny's for a Reuben sandwich.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.971
Ah? Authentic, right?

03:00.973 --> 03:03.057
It's definitely something.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.018
Ugh!

03:07.354 --> 03:09.021
Ah! So what's up?

03:10.190 --> 03:16.112
Well... Since we're gonna have
to be doing some repairs to Molly's,

03:16.238 --> 03:19.657
maybe now's the time to make
some modifications moving forward.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.785
Exactly! It's the perfect time
to add a little stage area

03:22.911 --> 03:24.620
and get some karaoke action going.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.330
I thought Molly's would benefit

03:26.456 --> 03:28.332
from a more intimate, upscale vibe,
right?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.626
Softer lighting,
maybe a few tapas on the menu.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.670
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

03:32.796 --> 03:35.298
- Why can't we mix things up?
- What's the point of changing...

03:35.424 --> 03:40.011
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are our manners?
We've got a fourth partner now.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.138
What do you think, Shay?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.101
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61...

03:47.227 --> 03:49.645
- You guys mind if I ride along?
- Of course not.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.023
Single car accident.
Vermont and 127th Street.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.078
- There's a guy still in there.
- Get back!

04:09.791 --> 04:12.376
That's gonna come down.
Everyone watch working underneath.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.715
He's pinned in. Pop the window.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.555
- Otis, get that crowd back.
- Ladies and gentlemen, let's move back.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.807
Somebody's hurt real bad over here!

04:26.934 --> 04:28.976
Shay! Rafferty! We got a victim!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.149
The driver must have hit her.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.444
Dispatch, we're gonna need another ambo
at Vermont and 127th.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.863
It was Jimmy Boylan!
He was drunk off his ass.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.823
Back up, sir. Back.

04:45.077 --> 04:48.162
- Pulse is strong.
- Mills! Grab the jaws.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.083
Everyone get clear!

05:23.115 --> 05:24.115
- Whoa!
- What?

05:24.241 --> 05:26.617
This guy's hammered. Come on.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.245
Capp, you got him?

05:35.168 --> 05:37.169
You know, maybe you
should check her Glasgow...

05:47.389 --> 05:48.848
The grid's out, Chief.

05:48.974 --> 05:52.768
Yeah, this weather, people without power
are people without heat.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.229
Not to mention the wolves come out
when the lights are off.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.690
Yeah. Stay with me.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.860
Have your attention, please.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.195
At this point, we have
no way of knowing how long

06:03.321 --> 06:05.531
it will take to get
the electricity back on.

06:05.657 --> 06:10.411
So anybody who needs a safe place
to ride out this blackout,

06:10.537 --> 06:13.289
you're more than welcome
to come join us at Firehouse 51.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.832
We have our own generator

06:14.958 --> 06:18.461
and we can provide hot food,
a warm place to stay, and safety.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.714
Thank you. Let's go.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.054
The generator's fine.
Something's wrong with the furnace.

06:28.180 --> 06:30.556
When it switched from regular power,
it might've shorted.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.141
We'll take a look.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.773
Hey, do you know
where I left my toolbox?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.028
Yeah, it's in your locker.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.739
It's where you've kept it
for the past five years.

06:47.616 --> 06:49.283
Right, right.

06:53.288 --> 06:57.083
Our Four News chopper was in the air
to capture the blackout as it happened.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.585
If you look in the upper right-hand
corner of the screen...

06:59.711 --> 07:01.212
Look, look, look!

07:01.338 --> 07:02.880
Authorities at Commonwealth Edison

07:03.006 --> 07:05.424
said this was likely the cause
of the blackout.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.968
A spokesperson at ComEd
said they don't know

07:08.095 --> 07:10.054
how long it will take
to restore the power.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.681
I expect everybody to pitch in.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.059
Show this neighborhood
how important they are to us.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.393
You got it, Chief.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.564
Hey, Chief, if you don't mind, I'd...
I'd like to stick around.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.635
Go right in there, guys.
There's some blankets.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.220
Everything you need, okay?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.056
Can I help you?

07:54.182 --> 07:56.976
Oh, I'm sorry.
We don't know where to go.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.894
Oh, of course. We'll get you set up.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.563
My husband has emphysema.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.898
- I told you, I'm fine.
- Hush, Sam.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.068
I don't know what she'd do
if she didn't have me to worry about.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.654
Well, now she has us
to do it for her, huh?

08:11.366 --> 08:13.200
Hey, the damn pilot went out,

08:13.326 --> 08:15.703
and every time I relight it,
the whole system shuts off.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.913
All right, let me take a look.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.005
The coupling is loose.
Hand me a, uh... thing.

08:26.131 --> 08:30.259
- What?
- The metal thingy.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.719
Yeah.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.056
- Screwdriver? Wrench?
- The crescent wrench. Yeah.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.727
Thank you.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.483
- Have you talked to Dawson?
- About?

08:46.610 --> 08:47.776
Your memory problem.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.113
Told you, I'm getting better.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.158
Doesn't look like it from here.

08:55.911 --> 08:57.328
You need to talk to someone.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.039
If you're uncomfortable with Dawson
because you two are dating...

09:00.165 --> 09:03.751
No offense, but the last thing I want
from you is relationship advice.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.879
I'm not talking about your relationship.
I'm talking about your head.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.130
There we go.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.968
Yep. Ta-da!

09:15.639 --> 09:16.889
Thanks for the help.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.937
Hey, that Rafferty sure is gruff, huh?

09:23.063 --> 09:26.148
Um, I didn't notice.
I'm pretty sure everybody likes her.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.816
She's been throwing me the stink eye.

09:27.943 --> 09:29.902
I mean, what does she want?
Half the city blacks out,

09:30.028 --> 09:31.946
I'm not supposed to pitch in?
That's what I do.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.906
I'm sure it'll be fine.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.085
Hey, guys, you can't be in here.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.921
- No sweat. We're leaving.
- Cool.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.927
I swear to you, Vince, he's here.
Boylan's brother Tommy is here.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.929
I wouldn't have called you
if I hadn't seen him.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.306
- He by himself?
- Looked it to me.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.309
- What are you gonna do?
- Say hello.

10:07.232 --> 10:10.734
- Did someone call in the cavalry?
- Oh, thank God.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.988
I'm about two boat loads
shy of not feeding anyone.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.739
Hey. You got my text!

10:15.865 --> 10:18.826
Yeah! Came right over.
Brought everything in my mom's pantry.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.453
- Nope.
- I didn't get to go to the store today.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.871
So we're a bit SOL.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.791
Unless your mom had, uh,
two fish and three loaves of bread.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.084
What are those?

10:27.210 --> 10:30.337
Oh, well, that's First Watch
and Third Watch, so we can't...

10:33.425 --> 10:36.218
- Right.
- I'll go grab the bolt cutters.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.014
Hey. Um... I need to talk to you later.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.392
- Okay. Everything all right?
- Yeah.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.939
Let's get all the chips
and dip out on the table.

10:49.065 --> 10:51.358
- People can graze.
- Boom, boom.

10:51.484 --> 10:56.530
And this is where we keep the pots and
pans and big old knives and what-not.

10:57.615 --> 11:00.200
- What're you doing?
- The kids are scared.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.786
I thought I'd give them the tour
and make them feel safer.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.121
Knives?

11:04.247 --> 11:06.457
I haven't done this in, like, 35 years.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.376
Okay, look. I'll tell you what. Just
take them out to the apparatus floor

11:09.502 --> 11:11.587
and have them play Cornhole
until I get Katie set up.

11:11.713 --> 11:15.674
And then, uh, I have something special
for everyone to see. Huh?

11:15.800 --> 11:17.051
Back the way we came.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.053
Through those doors.
Here we go. Who's with me?

11:22.349 --> 11:25.017
How's that pedestrian doing
you guys ran to Chicago Med?

11:25.143 --> 11:28.896
She coded twice along the way.
It's doubtful she'll survive the night.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.566
But in case you're wondering, the drunk
that hit her is gonna be just fine.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.984
Yeah.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.028
That's an ambulance.
Go to the front of it.

11:36.154 --> 11:39.948
I want to show you guys something.
You're gonna love it. Right this way.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.169
Can't get away from here,
can you, sis?

11:52.295 --> 11:53.587
Why would I want to?

11:56.341 --> 11:59.259
- You tell him yet?
- Later.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.226
Here you go.
Warm and toasty.

12:07.352 --> 12:08.352
You're still here.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.021
Yeah, I told the Chief I'd hang out
and help out a little bit.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.147
Great.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.109
Hey, you got any aspirin?

12:15.235 --> 12:18.070
- What? Why? Are you feeling the...
- It's a headache.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.738
People get them all the time.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.199
Right. Yeah.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.161
- Um, I actually do. In my purse.
- Cool.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.964
- How we looking?
- We're not gonna have enough.

12:37.090 --> 12:40.509
Oh, hey! You know Houk's Grocery,
up the road?

12:40.635 --> 12:42.761
51's been buying from there for years.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.264
- Old man Houk, he lives above it.
- Okay.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.393
See if he'll open, and get as much beef
and beans as you can.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.437
Oh. And he's not too good at hearing,

12:51.563 --> 12:54.022
so keep on knocking until he answers,
all right? He owes us.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.357
Yes, sir.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.198
Donna.

13:04.075 --> 13:06.243
Good to see you.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.079
I thought you might need
some extra blankets.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.957
Plus the power's out in my building,
no surprise.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.125
Sorry to hear that.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.128
It's nasty out there.
Kids are running wild.

13:16.254 --> 13:19.715
I saw people walking in and out
of that electronics shop on 136th,

13:19.841 --> 13:21.758
carrying out
whatever wasn't bolted down.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.178
- Stay here with us tonight.
- Yeah?

13:25.638 --> 13:30.350
- Definitely.
- Well, I promise not to distract you.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.394
Well, I hope that's a promise
you don't keep.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.364
Hey!

13:58.338 --> 14:00.380
- Put the knife down, buddy.
- No, you stay out of this!

14:03.051 --> 14:04.510
You stay the hell out of this.

14:05.553 --> 14:10.933
This kid's drunk brother
put my niece in a coma!

14:11.059 --> 14:13.519
Listen, listen!
I'll tell you one more time.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.605
Put the knife down
and get the hell out of here.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.083
You!

14:37.418 --> 14:38.835
You're a dead man.

14:48.471 --> 14:50.222
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.976
Um... I apologize for that.

14:54.102 --> 14:58.188
Rest assured that we will make sure
nothing like that ever happens again.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.067
You keep your eyes peeled.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.611
If anyone acts the least bit aggressive,

15:04.737 --> 15:07.489
you do what Kelly just did
and you throw their ass out in the snow.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.909
Good job.

15:12.453 --> 15:16.623
- Hey, you all right?
- Yeah. I'm just freaked.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.767
Mr. Houk?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.645
Mr. Houk?

15:40.648 --> 15:43.275
Hey, can you come to the door, please?
It's important, Mr. Houk.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.778
The power's out! We're closed!

15:46.904 --> 15:49.781
I'm from Firehouse 51.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.369
We got a bazillion people down there
and they're all looking for soup.

15:54.495 --> 15:56.913
Joe Cruz said you might be able
to help us out.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.585
Thank you, sir.

16:01.711 --> 16:05.589
That Joe Cruz uses guilt
better than any mom I ever met.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.800
I've given him more discounts
than I know what to do with.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.261
What do you need?

16:11.387 --> 16:14.139
Sir, we need some, uh...
We need some beef and some beans.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.184
I got a couple of cases of beans
you could take,

16:17.310 --> 16:18.685
back there in the store room.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.772
But you got to get them.
My back ain't so good no more.

16:21.898 --> 16:23.982
And I'll wrap up
some of this meat for you.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.942
Thank you, sir. Back here?

16:34.744 --> 16:40.248
- How'd you do on smoke drill today?
- Uh, 7:40.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.752
You fail the physical test, you can't
retake it until the next round, Dawson.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.630
- I know, I know.
- 7:40 won't cut it.

16:49.092 --> 16:53.136
- Hey, have you been around Casey today?
- Yeah. Why?

16:53.262 --> 16:56.014
Um, he was complaining
about a headache.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.308
Come on, if you know something,
you've got to tell me.

16:58.434 --> 17:03.021
He says he's fine. But I'm not so sure.
His memory's off.

17:03.147 --> 17:06.191
- Yeah.
- Oh, Miss? Miss?

17:06.317 --> 17:08.151
Something's not right.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.029
Even with the oxygen,
he doesn't sound good.

17:11.155 --> 17:13.448
I can hear you. And I'm fine.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.368
All right, Mr. Danvers. Um...

17:16.494 --> 17:18.245
I'm gonna take a look
just to be safe, okay?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.080
Can you sit up for me, please?

17:26.754 --> 17:29.214
- Thank you.
- I got you.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.678
Take a deep breath for me, please.

17:36.139 --> 17:37.347
And again.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.270
Well?

17:43.396 --> 17:46.231
Well, given his condition, his
respirations are in the normal range.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.234
I know that there's a lot
going on around here,

17:49.360 --> 17:51.862
but you guys get some rest.
Both of you.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.703
- Hey, Shay, wait up!
- Hey.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.622
- Hey. Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure. What's up?

18:02.749 --> 18:06.042
Okay. Well, first off,
I just want to thank you again,

18:06.169 --> 18:09.296
sincerely, for bailing Molly's out.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.340
- Without your help, we were goners.
- Yeah.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.926
I just want you to know
how much it means to me.

18:15.052 --> 18:18.889
I love that bar, Shay. I mean,
I really love it. You know?

18:19.015 --> 18:22.184
- Absolutely. No sweat.
- And there's just one more thing.

18:22.310 --> 18:26.396
Uh, I really want to stress to you
how important it is that,

18:26.522 --> 18:29.858
you know, Molly's remain
what she is, you know?

18:29.984 --> 18:32.736
A good, old-fashioned neighborhood bar.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.782
I think that trying to make her
into something that she's not

18:36.908 --> 18:38.825
would be a huge mistake.

18:38.951 --> 18:43.205
Right, yeah. But I'd prefer to be
a silent partner on this, so...

18:43.331 --> 18:45.749
But, uh, you're the deciding vote, okay?

18:45.875 --> 18:49.628
Oh. Mm-hmm. Okay.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.756
And you really like what I said, right?

18:52.882 --> 18:56.760
- Yeah. Yeah, it's good.
- Ah! Excellent, excellent.

18:56.886 --> 18:59.387
- Yeah.
- Hey, thanks for hearing me out.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.561
- Hey.
- I'm looking for Chief Boden.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.855
Yeah. Over here.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.941
It's a madhouse out there, trust me.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.151
We're calling in every
off-duty officer we've got.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.446
- The looting is out of control.
- We understand.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.615
That's actually not why I stopped by.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.326
We've got an informant
inside the Keeler family.

19:21.452 --> 19:24.788
A bunch of bad egg bruisers
that cause mayhem on the South Side.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.790
Apparently one of your guys
went toe-to-toe

19:26.916 --> 19:28.959
with Vince Keeler about an hour ago.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.126
Guilty.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.254
All right. Well, Vince is
the worst of the bunch.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.465
Twice called up on murder charges,
but the cases didn't make.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.843
He did a stint in Cook County
for assault and battery

19:37.969 --> 19:40.929
for breaking a guy's jaw, but that's
the only case that ever stuck.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.764
Great.

19:42.890 --> 19:45.809
I got word from my CI that Vince
came back huffing and puffing

19:45.935 --> 19:47.686
that he's gonna kill a fireman tonight.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.355
I'll take my chances.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.235
All the same, I'm gonna
have an officer parked outside.

19:55.361 --> 19:59.239
- Thank you.
- Absolutely. Chief, you have my number.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.491
Guys, if anything jumps off,
just call me.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.788
Now, which one's the kid
that he went after?

20:06.914 --> 20:07.914
There.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.250
All right, I'm gonna take him back
to the district with me,

20:10.376 --> 20:12.627
for safety concerns. Thank you.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.589
- You walk me out?
- Yeah, you got it.

20:18.426 --> 20:19.467
You okay?

20:22.430 --> 20:26.182
- My brother. He's the one that...
- I heard.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.812
But we don't know what happened,
and that's for other people to decide.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.024
And you had nothing to do with it. Okay?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.110
Hey, Tommy.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.779
I'm Detective Lindsay.
I'd like you to come with me.

20:39.906 --> 20:43.074
We'll go down to the district office
to keep you safe tonight.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.750
Listen, don't try to take
this guy on again...

20:52.710 --> 20:54.419
- Kelly.
- Kelly.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.088
From what I hear, you humiliated him.

20:57.214 --> 21:02.135
He's not gonna forget that
and he's not gonna fight fair.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.846
So if you see him again,
I want you to call me,

21:04.972 --> 21:06.640
or Antonio, or any of us.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.100
- I mean it.
- I will.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.605
All right. Let's go.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.737
Hey, guys, just post up here.

21:20.905 --> 21:23.573
Make sure nobody shady comes in. Thanks.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.840
We're closed.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.635
That's cool, pops.
We weren't planning on buying nothing.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.063
Why'd you make me do that, fool?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.191
Just grab the stuff and go!

21:59.902 --> 22:02.278
Hey! Hey!

22:16.377 --> 22:18.795
- Get out!
- Come on, man!

22:29.598 --> 22:32.767
It's gonna be all right.
Put some pressure on that wound, okay?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.981
Come on. Come on!

22:38.774 --> 22:39.774
Damn it!

22:43.696 --> 22:47.157
Good evening, ladies.
Welcome to Firehouse 51.

22:47.283 --> 22:51.286
- Thanks. Where the food at?
- One second, please.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.708
While we are more than happy to provide
you with food and shelter for the night,

22:56.834 --> 23:01.254
I want to make it perfectly clear
there is to be no business

23:01.380 --> 23:03.214
conducted in this firehouse.

23:03.340 --> 23:05.175
Are you outta your mind?

23:05.301 --> 23:07.719
Like we're really gonna do business
in a damn firehouse.

23:07.845 --> 23:11.806
- Uh-uh.
- Kitchen, through there.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.977
- The nerve.
- Okay!

23:23.778 --> 23:25.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:25.196 --> 23:26.362
- Doing okay?
- Yeah.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.282
I mean, it's never a dull moment
around here, right?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.576
Oh, yeah. Unless you're
talking to Mouch

23:31.702 --> 23:33.995
about parliamentary procedure
in union meetings.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.251
So, what'd you want to talk about?

23:42.088 --> 23:44.005
I just wanted to let you know...

23:50.054 --> 23:51.721
Tonight's the night.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.227
You mean...

23:57.353 --> 24:00.730
Truck 81,
Squad 3, Engine 51, Ambulance 61,

24:00.856 --> 24:05.193
Battalion 25. People down,
unknown causes, 4702 Hellman Street.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.154
Everyone, please move away
from the truck and the bay doors.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.533
We have to get these vehicles out!
Thank you.

24:51.699 --> 24:56.828
- Uh, where's the call?
- This is the address.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.664
Hey! We don't know
what happened to them.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.207
We tried knocking on their door.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.293
When no one answered,
we looked in the window.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.258
Dispatch, we've have four victims down.
Unknown causes.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.636
We're gonna need two additional
ambulance units at 4702 Hellman.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.722
Copy that, Battalion.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.231
Carbon Monoxide!
Almost 800 parts per million in here.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.733
Let's move!

25:38.579 --> 25:40.496
Check for a pulse,
then get them on O2 immediately.

25:40.623 --> 25:42.916
- Hey!
- Sorry. You weren't moving fast enough.

25:43.042 --> 25:46.377
If we're gonna have a problem
we can discuss it afterwards.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.470
Hey, Mr. Houk, look at me, look at me.
You got a first aid kit?

25:55.596 --> 25:56.804
No.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.443
You're okay.

26:12.363 --> 26:14.113
You're okay. I'm gonna take care of you.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.408
- I need you to push down, okay?
- Okay.

26:17.534 --> 26:20.078
Huh? You're doing great.
Here, put this on it.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.373
Take a breath. You're good, you're good.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.500
I need you to hold down nice and firm,
okay?

26:26.585 --> 26:29.128
All right, look at me. Look at me.

26:29.255 --> 26:30.838
Hold tight, hold tight.

26:33.175 --> 26:34.842
Okay. Put them on.

26:37.388 --> 26:40.098
This is gonna hurt.

26:40.224 --> 26:42.517
You're good, you're good.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.228
Hold it. Look right at me,
look right at me.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.146
You're doing good.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.860
Both breathing!

26:52.987 --> 26:54.028
How are Mom and Dad?

26:55.698 --> 26:57.532
They're gone.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.659
Carbon Monoxide readings
were off the charts.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.744
Kids must've come in
and found them afterwards.

27:01.870 --> 27:05.123
All right. There's nothing
we can do about that.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.667
Let's get these kids out of the cold
and to the hospital.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.878
- I'll stay here. Ride back with Truck.
- Good idea.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.845
She said tonight's the night.
Her words.

27:18.971 --> 27:19.887
Whoa!

27:20.014 --> 27:22.056
Have you ever done anything
in the firehouse?

27:22.182 --> 27:25.143
- You mean with someone?
- You're sick.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.519
Oh, wait. You haven't?

27:30.357 --> 27:33.443
Oh, all right. Okay. Guys?

27:38.198 --> 27:39.866
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.911
- How's it going in here?
- Folks are happy to be warm.

27:45.414 --> 27:49.250
- You have a nice house here, Wallace.
- Yeah.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.550
- I'm gonna go check on some things.
- I'm gonna pass out food.

27:57.676 --> 28:01.888
- Yeah. Um, thank you.
- Yeah.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.144
Is... this your card?

28:08.270 --> 28:10.480
Come on. How is that...

28:10.606 --> 28:12.565
Okay. He said he'd be here
in just a minute.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.317
Okay, kids!

28:14.443 --> 28:19.947
It is time for the amazing Joe Cruz

28:20.074 --> 28:24.160
and his animal friends!

28:29.249 --> 28:30.875
Well, let's see.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.925
Huh? Yeah?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.844
Just got to tie that right there,
and I'll just...

28:49.103 --> 28:52.271
Okay, tell you what, guys.
Mouch, maybe you could help me out...

28:52.398 --> 28:54.816
- You bet.
- You got to stretch it real good.

28:54.942 --> 28:57.944
- That's the only way they'll blow.
- Over here? A little further?

28:58.070 --> 28:59.112
Like that?

29:06.453 --> 29:08.121
Hey, listen.

29:09.248 --> 29:13.167
Olive branch fully extended.
You were right, I was wrong.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.798
You don't think I know
what shoes I gotta fill?

29:18.924 --> 29:21.551
The only one more loved around here
than that damn dog is you.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.887
And trust me,
I've heard it from everybody.

29:25.013 --> 29:28.015
But that's what I walked into,
and I'm dealing with it.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.685
But it isn't gonna help me
when you tag along on runs

29:30.811 --> 29:33.646
and you cross-examine my every move.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.774
No. Yeah. Done.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.201
Help! Help!

29:47.327 --> 29:48.578
Something's wrong.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.041
I don't know what happened.
She just collapsed!

29:54.168 --> 29:58.004
- You gotta help her, please.
- She's not breathing. Stay here!

29:59.256 --> 30:00.590
Watch out! Watch out!

30:03.177 --> 30:05.678
There's a woman coding in the bullpen!
I'm going for the monitor!

30:20.986 --> 30:22.361
Damn it.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.615
Hey, come on. Let's go.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.578
Clear a path!

30:32.247 --> 30:34.874
- Watch out, guys! Watch out, watch out.
- Clear out!

30:35.000 --> 30:37.293
Her breathing is agonal.
We gotta bag her.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.128
All right, let's back it up,
folks.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.922
Let's give them some room to work, okay?

30:41.048 --> 30:43.132
Hey, sir. Right here.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.092
How do you want to do this?

30:45.219 --> 30:47.678
Hand me the pads.
Take over chest compressions.

30:48.597 --> 30:51.224
I told her to rest.
I told her to stop fussing.

30:56.271 --> 30:59.482
She's in V-Fib. Okay, everybody clear!

31:00.651 --> 31:02.109
Shocking.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.489
She's still in V-Fib. Going again.

31:06.615 --> 31:08.699
No, Maggie, no.
You can't leave me. You can't...

31:08.825 --> 31:11.536
Everybody clear!
Shocking.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.873
Emergency lights kicked in.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.416
I've got a rhythm and a pulse.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.128
- Come on.
- Thank you.

31:24.258 --> 31:27.843
- What happened?
- Heart attack. Let's go!

31:30.764 --> 31:32.682
Hey, she's gonna be okay, Sam.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.434
Come on, let me drive you
to the hospital.

31:40.482 --> 31:43.568
Casey, grab your tools. Boden wants us
to check on the generator.

31:43.694 --> 31:45.152
Yeah.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.627
- Maggie?
- Oh, she's fine.

32:01.753 --> 32:05.590
Pulse rate's stable, blood pressure back
to normal. They have her in five.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.968
Thank you. Thank you so much.

32:09.094 --> 32:11.470
Oh, actually,
Rafferty should get the credit.

32:12.389 --> 32:13.806
She's a great paramedic.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.518
I can't thank you enough.

32:17.644 --> 32:20.104
It was my pleasure, sir.
Let me take you to her.

32:26.820 --> 32:27.987
That's nice.

32:28.822 --> 32:31.866
- Deserved.
- Yeah.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.203
Hey, uh, listen, while I got you.

32:36.330 --> 32:39.540
I just wanted to make sure that we're
on the same page about Molly's.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.709
I don't think I'm being unreasonable
by suggesting

32:41.835 --> 32:44.128
that we should consider
a more upscale crowd.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.922
I mean, it can't hurt to elevate
the beer and baseball crowd, right?

32:47.049 --> 32:50.259
- Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.
- Yeah.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.720
Looks good to me.
There's plenty of fuel.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.768
What?

32:58.894 --> 33:02.313
- My big crescent wrench is missing.
- Are you sure you put it back?

33:02.439 --> 33:06.776
Yes, I'm sure, Severide. I put it
right on top where it always is.

33:08.362 --> 33:10.196
Fuel filter's clogged.

33:13.825 --> 33:16.952
All right, fire it up.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.753
Yay!

33:48.360 --> 33:50.569
I thought I made myself very clear.

33:53.115 --> 33:56.617
I'm sorry. I thought... I thought...
Excuse me.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.288
Oh, God.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.542
Otis!

34:06.920 --> 34:10.339
- Oh, hey. Um, wait up.
- What's going on?

34:10.465 --> 34:12.758
While I got you.
I was wondering what you think

34:12.884 --> 34:15.219
about building a karaoke stage
at Molly's?

34:15.345 --> 34:17.054
What, so you can sing? Or...

34:17.180 --> 34:19.640
What? No. I mean...
Maybe to get things started.

34:19.766 --> 34:23.102
But listen, those things are supposed
to do, like, gangbusters.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.063
- Yeah.
- Anyway, just, uh, think about it.

34:26.898 --> 34:27.898
Cool.

34:38.660 --> 34:41.537
Listen, I think you're out of danger,
but I need to head back to the firehouse

34:41.663 --> 34:42.872
and get an ambulance over here.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.708
- Can you hold on without me?
- Yeah.

34:52.174 --> 34:55.301
Step aside, Mr. Fireman.
We're gonna get what's ours.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.053
All right, all of you need to go
right back where you came from!

34:58.180 --> 35:02.266
- I don't think so.
- What you gonna do? Take on all of us?

35:10.233 --> 35:11.317
You first.

35:15.655 --> 35:16.614
Come on!

35:21.119 --> 35:22.870
Hey, man! Let's go! Go, go!

35:30.587 --> 35:33.589
Hey! Everybody disperse
from this area immediately!

35:33.715 --> 35:36.383
We need an ambulance.
Stab wound, upper abdomen!

35:36.510 --> 35:39.887
Central, we need an ambulance.
1427 Racine, stab wound.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.055
You'll be all right.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.807
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.102
Sir, you're going to be all right.
Help is on the way.

35:47.229 --> 35:50.731
Thank you, son.
If it weren't for you...

35:50.857 --> 35:54.443
You just hang in there, Mr. Houk.
Everything's gonna be fine.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.243
It was a filter clog, Chief. My fault.

36:02.369 --> 36:05.955
I should've checked it when the weather
turned, but I had other stuff going on.

36:06.081 --> 36:07.790
Doesn't matter,
as long as it's working now.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.166
Right.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.502
Hey, Chief. I just heard chatter
from my CI

36:11.628 --> 36:14.421
that Vince Keeler sent somebody
over here to rough up Kelly.

36:22.973 --> 36:23.973
Okay.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.832
What's up, man! Come on!

37:17.736 --> 37:18.861
Hey!

37:28.872 --> 37:29.872
Drop it!

37:31.333 --> 37:34.043
Put it down or I swear
I will put you on the floor!

37:40.300 --> 37:41.967
Get up!

37:42.093 --> 37:44.178
Get up. Put your hands on the wall.

37:46.890 --> 37:49.683
- You okay?
- Yeah.

37:50.727 --> 37:52.853
Used up another one of my nine lives.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.939
I'm pretty sure you're in double digits,
man.

37:55.065 --> 37:56.398
- You got him?
- Yeah.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.990
- The grid's back on.
- God, what a night.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.868
Okay, let's help these people
out of here.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.703
Get them back to their homes.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.915
I'd like you to come down to the
district until we can snatch up Keeler.

38:13.041 --> 38:14.792
What's that gonna do?

38:14.918 --> 38:17.002
We've got ways of letting people know
when to back off.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.924
- Yeah.
- Great. You all right?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.092
Yeah. Yeah.

38:26.262 --> 38:29.223
- Hey, yours.
- Thank you.

38:29.349 --> 38:31.100
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.448
Chief, I just wanted to say I'm...

38:48.702 --> 38:50.911
Right. Um...

38:57.711 --> 38:58.711
I, uh...

38:59.587 --> 39:00.671
Yeah?

39:02.966 --> 39:05.759
I never thought I could have a chance
at something like this.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.941
My balloon animals, I'm telling you,
I got to work on them.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.484
No, they're as good as they need to be.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.361
Thanks so much for looking after
these two.

39:24.487 --> 39:26.572
They slept like babies
after you tired them out.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.656
Our pleasure.

39:27.782 --> 39:31.076
If I have to tell you "I'm fine" one
more time, it's not gonna be fine.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.996
Severide... He told me that you've been
forgetting things.

39:34.122 --> 39:38.459
I had a pounding headache.
I could barely remember my own name.

39:38.585 --> 39:39.543
What else do you want?

39:39.669 --> 39:41.503
I just... I want you to be honest
with me.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.299
Listen, if something serious is going
on, you'd be the first person I'd tell.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.470
Hey, Dawson, come here for a sec!

39:49.596 --> 39:51.221
- See you at home, okay?
- Yeah.

39:51.347 --> 39:56.018
Listen, we were just going over
our plan to do the whole...

39:56.144 --> 39:57.436
Wait, what plan?

39:57.562 --> 40:01.023
Nothing. We talked, and...

40:01.149 --> 40:05.027
No, no. We talked and Shay's on board.

40:05.153 --> 40:07.863
On board with what?
Your bad idea to have a karaoke night?

40:07.989 --> 40:10.115
- Hey...
- That's not any dumber than your idea

40:10.241 --> 40:12.743
to turn it into some hoity-toity
hipster bar.

40:12.869 --> 40:15.204
Okay, let's see how Herrmann's
status quo's gotten us.

40:15.330 --> 40:16.413
Deadbeats and jack-ups.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.209
Guys. Guys, guys!
Look, I do have a vote here, okay?

40:20.335 --> 40:26.215
And no one's bothered to ask what
my plan is, so I have two words for you.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.384
Lesbian night.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.685
All right.

41:02.168 --> 41:05.963
Hey, Brian. Where are you?
I thought you said 7:00.

41:06.089 --> 41:09.633
Oh, no, no, no. I'm sure you're right.

41:09.759 --> 41:12.678
Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.437
Go! Go, go, go!
