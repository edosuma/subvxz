WEBVTT

00:04.240 --> 00:06.607
Does Elena enjoy
having both of you worship her?

00:06.840 --> 00:10.447
I love you. Look me in the eye.
Tell me you don't feel something for him.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.402
- Drink it.
- I turned a hundred times...

00:14.600 --> 00:17.001
- ...in the Appalachian mountains.
- Broke his bond.

00:17.240 --> 00:18.321
Easier said than done.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.807
Klaus drew this?
Does Klaus have a thing for you?

00:21.040 --> 00:25.011
- I would know if I were killing people.
- You wear a ring that lets you cheat death.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.487
How many times can you die
before it changes you?

00:27.680 --> 00:29.887
You telling me
your alter ego has a stake...

00:30.080 --> 00:32.890
that can kill an entire line
of vampires, possibly mine?

00:33.080 --> 00:36.448
There's only one stake,
which means only one Original has to die.

00:36.720 --> 00:38.882
- I want them all to die.
- You're not Rebekah.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.448
My name is Esther.
And we have a great deal in common.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.644
- What took you so long?
- Alaric didn't want to hand over the stake.

00:56.280 --> 00:58.169
Luckily, I'm quite the charmer.

00:59.400 --> 01:00.447
That's it?

01:00.640 --> 01:03.723
The last of the white oak stakes
that can kill us.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.730
Do you want to do the honors,
or shall I?

01:12.720 --> 01:14.643
Well, that's that, then.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.768
Pack your bags. We're leaving.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.691
- Today?
"Why not?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.041
Nothing's keeping us here.

01:21.240 --> 01:24.244
- We'll grab the doppelgÃ¤nger and be off.
- Tonight's the dance.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.046
- So?
- I'm head of the committee. We have to go.

01:27.240 --> 01:28.651
I'm not going to any dance.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.964
Caroline will be there.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.086
That means nothing to me.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.891
Please? I have big plans for tonight.

01:38.120 --> 01:39.451
Just go for me.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.681
Okay, fine.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.769
One last hurrah.

01:49.480 --> 01:51.448
One last hurrah, Nik.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.930
I've been calling you all day.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.806
Yeah, sorry about that.
I just needed to get my head together.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.128
- I take it Rebekah got the stake?
- Don't know.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.641
I woke up alone. Uh, there's no sign of it.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.126
Lovely. What now?

02:05.320 --> 02:08.642
Well, I think I need to get out of town.
You know, somewhere secluded.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.842
I keep blacking out. I'm still a threat.

02:11.039 --> 02:14.601
I don't know if now's the best time
for you to be going on a spirit quest.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.327
Ah, just for a couple days. I'm stocked up
on Bonnie's herb. I should be fine.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.363
<i>Uh, I gotta go</i>

02:24.680 --> 02:25.841
Quite the cunning liar.

02:27.360 --> 02:30.807
Well, Damon's too arrogant
to think his only friend would betray him.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.489
<i>Just as Niklaus would blindly accept
an invitation from his beloved sister...</i>

02:35.680 --> 02:38.524
unaware that he is headed
to his own death.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.328
Did you give him the stake?

02:41.880 --> 02:45.009
- He burned it without hesitation.
- So where's the real one?

02:45.200 --> 02:49.046
You'll get it when it can no longer be used
against me in this body.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.611
- So how do you...?
- How do I return to my true form?

02:57.360 --> 03:01.843
With a little magic
and some help from a vampire hunter.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.880
So Alaric is trying to pull himself together.
Why is that a bad thing?

03:38.080 --> 03:41.050
I just... I wish there was something
I could do.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.931
- Where do you want me to hang this thing?
- Argh. You know what?

03:44.160 --> 03:49.087
If Rebekah wanted to hang this monstrosity,
she should've shown up to do it herself.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.090
Heh.
- Just no.

03:52.280 --> 03:53.327
What are you doing?

03:53.760 --> 03:57.845
You can't just hang them.
They're supposed to trickle down.

03:58.040 --> 03:59.405
â€œTrickle down."

03:59.600 --> 04:01.409
Look at them, all bromancey.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.762
Yeah, I asked Matt
to help Jeremy readjust.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.406
He got him his old job back at the Grill.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.411
That was nice of him.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.722
Mm-hm. Jeremy's got a lot on his mind.

04:10.920 --> 04:13.651
The whole thing with Alaric
has got him stressed out.

04:13.840 --> 04:16.844
You sure it had nothing to do
with witnessing you and Damon...

04:17.040 --> 04:19.850
getting hot and heavy
in a skeevy motel?

04:20.040 --> 04:23.362
- I didn't tell you so you could torture me.
- Ah, what are friends for?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.404
So who are you bringing to the dance?

04:26.600 --> 04:30.491
What do you mean? I thought you,
Bonnie and I were going as girl dates.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.125
Heh, Bonnie has a date.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.448
- What?
- Jamie called and wanted to see her...

04:34.640 --> 04:36.290
- ...so she asked him.
- Hmm.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.121
So here's a thought.
Why don't you ask Stefan?

04:41.840 --> 04:44.491
I can't ask him on a date.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.688
I just made out with his brother.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.168
All the more reason. You're supposed
to be figuring out what you want.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.522
That's what Stefan
wanted you to do, right?

04:52.720 --> 04:53.926
- Yeah, but...
- But nothing.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.646
I've watched The Bachelor.
Okay, fair is fair.

04:57.280 --> 05:02.320
- It is Stefan's turn.
- Heh, yeah. And you're not biased or anything.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.649
I'm sorry, but Stefan is your epic love.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.450
And I'm not going down without a fight.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.681
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

05:18.920 --> 05:22.322
- Uh, do you have a second?
- Yeah, everything all right?

05:22.520 --> 05:27.367
Yeah, yeah, I just, um, I wanted to, uh...

05:29.200 --> 05:33.205
Caroline and I were talking about
going to the dance and, um...

05:36.160 --> 05:37.525
Okay, look.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.008
<i>I know where we're at, you and I,
and I know it would be stupid...</i>

05:41.200 --> 05:44.409
<i>to even think that we could go back
to the way things were...</i>

05:46.040 --> 05:49.840
but I'm going to the dance
and I'd like to go with you.

05:50.640 --> 05:52.563
<i>Um...</i>

05:54.200 --> 05:55.247
<i>I'd love that.</i>

05:56.760 --> 05:58.569
Okay, great.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.607
Bye.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.166
I'm thinking gardenia corsage.
Wrist, obviously.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.206
You don't wanna stab her in the chest
with the pin. That could get messy.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.765
Damon, I...

06:25.600 --> 06:27.250
<i>Meredith.</i>

06:33.280 --> 06:36.568
- Don't do that. It's not funny.
- Oh, come on. It's a little funny.

06:36.760 --> 06:39.730
- What do you want, Damon?
- I need medical advice for a friend.

06:39.960 --> 06:44.090
Alaric, you remember him, right?
About 6'2", tried to hack you into pieces.

06:44.280 --> 06:45.725
How is he?

06:45.960 --> 06:48.486
Are those herbs
that Bonnie made for him working?

06:48.680 --> 06:51.445
I don't know.
Can they work if he doesn't take them?

06:54.240 --> 06:56.288
I found these in his loft, untouched.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.769
Why are we here?

07:01.960 --> 07:05.442
Long ago, on this spot,
my son tore my heart from my chest.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.368
The violence of my death
marked this ground for all time.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.607
I'll need your ring.

07:21.800 --> 07:25.247
Now, why would I give you the one thing
that protects me from death?

07:25.440 --> 07:27.442
I will give you
all the protection you need.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.042
However, the stake will burn up
in the body of its first victim.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.651
If you are to kill all of my children...

07:35.840 --> 07:40.164
I will need to bind the protective magic
in your ring to the stake...

07:40.360 --> 07:43.842
thus rendering the white oak
indestructible.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.323
<i>The ultimate weapon...</i>

08:44.840 --> 08:46.569
for the ultimate hunter.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.446
Wow.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.371
You look very dapper.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.770
You look, uh...

09:10.840 --> 09:12.080
very beautiful.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.767
Here, I, uh, got something for you.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.046
Thank you.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.928
So given our dangerous dance karma...

09:41.360 --> 09:42.600
you sure you're up for this?

09:42.800 --> 09:45.883
Getting out of bed
is dangerous these days, heh...

09:46.080 --> 09:47.445
but we have to live our lives.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.880
Hmm.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.570
Who gave you that horrible advice?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.843
Heh. Some guy I used to date
said it once or twice.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.405
Right.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.326
- Shall we?
- Please.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.167
<i>I'm in a little bit of trouble</i>

10:06.360 --> 10:07.725
<i>And I'm in real deep</i>

10:09.120 --> 10:11.646
<i>From the beginning to the end
He was no more than a friend to me</i>

10:11.880 --> 10:14.247
Have I told you
how amazingly awesome you are?

10:15.600 --> 10:18.444
Yeah, I'm one of the good ones. I know.

10:18.640 --> 10:21.007
Why the compliments?
What else do you want?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.886
I know that you and Elena
have been getting closer lately.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.445
And your point is...?

10:26.680 --> 10:30.207
One way or the other,
she's pretty much spoken for.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.649
Elena's my friend, Caroline.
I'm just looking out for her.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.490
And I'm just looking out for you.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.401
Because sometimes the people
who love her get caught in the crossfire.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.602
<i>Ooh, I wanna love that man</i>

10:42.600 --> 10:43.886
What's up?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.167
What's he doing here?

10:46.240 --> 10:48.208
<i>My only sin is I can't win</i>

10:49.600 --> 10:51.170
Are you crazy?

10:51.360 --> 10:53.488
- If Klaus sees you...
- What's he gonna do?

10:53.680 --> 10:54.886
Draw you another picture?

10:55.080 --> 10:58.846
- Tyler, this isn't a joke.
- I can pretend I'm sired if I have to.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.407
I'm not gonna hide
while he's macking all over you.

11:01.600 --> 11:07.289
Tyler, you do not need
to be jealous of Klaus.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.965
I am jealous.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.005
But I'm also competitive. So hang on.
I'm about to sweep you off your feet.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.204
<i>Someone calla doctor
Need some help to rescue me</i>

11:23.400 --> 11:24.447
Teach me some moves.

11:24.640 --> 11:29.407
Oh, no, no, no. I, uh, blacked out
for most of this decade, remember?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.409
Heh. Nice try.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.041
<i>My only sin is I can't win</i>

11:35.240 --> 11:37.368
<i>Ooh, I wanna love that man</i>

11:44.560 --> 11:47.803
<i>You do</i>

11:48.000 --> 11:52.244
<i>Something to me</i>

11:52.920 --> 11:54.285
Bonnie seems happy.

11:54.520 --> 11:58.809
<i>Something that simply mystifies me</i>

11:59.000 --> 12:02.004
- She's working on it.
- I've been meaning to talk to her.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.561
- Apologize.
- Yeah, you should.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.481
Although, I wouldn't expect her
to forgive you. Or Damon.

12:11.320 --> 12:16.451
Listen, Stefan, uh, about Damon, we should
probably talk about the trip to Denver.

12:16.640 --> 12:17.971
I don't need to know, Elena.

12:18.160 --> 12:22.324
When all this is over, if you and I
find our way back to each other...

12:22.520 --> 12:24.443
you can tell me if you want to.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.770
Otherwise, I don't need to know.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.962
I don't want to know.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.682
How can you be so fair about this?

12:32.880 --> 12:35.611
Because after everything
I've put you through...

12:38.000 --> 12:40.970
I'm just honored
to be your date tonight.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.291
<i>For you do</i>

12:46.480 --> 12:50.849
<i>Something to me</i>

12:51.760 --> 12:58.769
<i>That nobody else can do</i>

13:01.920 --> 13:03.160
We three need to talk.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.120
Sorry. Uh, hey. Bonnie.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.284
Uh...
- Why are you still wearing your ring'?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.603
- Didn't Elena tell you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know all about Alaric.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.122
When my sister stops hanging out
with vampires, I'll take it off.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.566
- A, uh, ex-boyfriend?
- Yep.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.046
That's not awkward at all.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.720
If Alaric's sick,
we need to find a cure. Something.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.930
- We tried medicine, magic.
- Why don't we get him off vervain?

13:39.120 --> 13:41.646
- Compel him.
- To do what? Pretend to be Alaric?

13:41.880 --> 13:45.362
The guy we know is gone. We're talking
about someone who hates vampires...

13:45.560 --> 13:49.929
vampire sympathizers. Which makes one
of his obvious targets, I don't know, you.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.886
- What, you think he'd go after Elena?
- Uh, so, what are you suggesting we do?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.003
I suggest we put him out of his misery.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.009
- What?
- No way in hell.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.851
Oh, come on. It's what he would want.
It's a mercy killing.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.929
- You are out of your mind.
- Jeremy.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.010
Jer, stop.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.083
This is Alaric we're talking about.
Now, he looked out for us.

14:21.280 --> 14:24.090
- We need to do the same for him.
- No one's gonna hurt him.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.645
Hey. Hey. Look at me.

14:27.880 --> 14:28.961
I promise.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.241
Elena.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.405
If you wish to help your friend Alaric,
I suggest you come with me.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.611
Jeremy, go inside
and get Stefan and Damon. Now.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.930
I mean you no harm.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.090
But willingly or not, you will come.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.123
Salt.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.448
It's a binding agent for a spell.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.006
We're trapped here.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.801
- You had all kinds of moves out there.
- Yeah?

15:17.000 --> 15:20.971
I mean, I was just, you know,
trying to make a good impression.

15:21.160 --> 15:26.883
- Well, consider me impressed.
- Your friends seem pretty cool.

15:27.080 --> 15:30.323
Yeah. They're the most important thing
in the world to me.

15:32.680 --> 15:35.889
Though, you gotta admit,
this circle of people, it's kind of crazy.

15:36.120 --> 15:40.409
I mean, there's vampires, werewolves,
ex-boyfriends with magic rings.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.321
I mean, I'm just a normal guy.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.003
A normal guy wouldn't have said yes
to a date with me.

15:49.520 --> 15:51.409
Yeah, that's true.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.526
Sorry to spoil
your seven minutes in heaven.

16:17.720 --> 16:18.881
We have a problem.

16:20.440 --> 16:24.240
You'll forgive me for taking you
from the dance this evening.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.842
That's the burden of being
the doppelganger, I'm afraid.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.203
Your blood is a potent binding agent
for a witch's spell.

16:31.400 --> 16:35.041
- Just please don't hurt Alaric.
- She's not hurting me.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.245
Ric.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.041
What's going on?

16:44.440 --> 16:47.683
- What are you doing with him?
- I'm going to remake him.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.688
- Remake him?
- Make him strong.

16:50.880 --> 16:54.248
Fast. Like my children.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.726
Indestructible.

16:56.280 --> 17:01.844
For one final time, I'm going to tap into
the dark magic I used a thousand years ago.

17:02.080 --> 17:06.563
Like my husband, Mikael, before him,
I will make Alaric into a true hunter.

17:07.200 --> 17:11.250
- The vampire to end all vampires.
- You can't create another Original.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.410
What if he turns out to be a bigger monster
than your children?

17:14.599 --> 17:19.049
He won't, now that he's embraced
his darkest aspect.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.403
His hatred for them will become
more pure and uncompromising.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.885
- In death, that hatred will be magnified.
- You don't know that.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.731
- You don't know anything about him.
- You're wrong.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.891
Each time he died with that ring,
during his brief journey into death...

17:34.080 --> 17:37.448
I was there, on the other side.

17:38.280 --> 17:40.726
I spoke to him, I nurtured him...

17:40.920 --> 17:44.766
knowing that every death
brought him closer to his true self.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.971
Vampires took everything from him.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.884
Now he's getting his vengeance.

17:56.280 --> 18:02.890
<i>Someday he'll come along
The man I love</i>

18:04.840 --> 18:06.649
What is it?

18:08.560 --> 18:09.800
Where have you been, mate?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.081
- I just got back in town.
- That's funny.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.802
I don't recall giving you permission
to leave in the first place.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.923
You don't mind if I cut in, do you?

18:19.120 --> 18:20.963
Yes, actually, we do.

18:23.960 --> 18:25.485
No.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.687
It's fine.

18:30.800 --> 18:33.007
Why do you always have to prove
you're the alpha male?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.202
I don't have to prove anything,
I'm the alpha male.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.400
Come on. One dance.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.126
I won't bite.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.402
<i>And though it seems absurd</i>

18:43.640 --> 18:46.644
<i>I know we both</i>

18:46.840 --> 18:53.485
<i>Won't say a word</i>

18:54.360 --> 18:59.605
<i>Maybe I shall meet him Sunday</i>

19:00.360 --> 19:02.966
You would have loved
the 1920s, Caroline.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.728
Girls were reckless, sexy, fun.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.843
They literally used to dance
until they dropped.

19:10.080 --> 19:13.402
Heh, I don't suppose that happened
to their dance partners.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.523
You should be nicer to me.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.210
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.204
I'd invite you to come with me, but we both
know you're not ready to accept my offer.

19:22.560 --> 19:27.361
Perhaps one day, in a year,
or even in a century...

19:27.600 --> 19:31.764
you'll turn up at my door and let me
show you what the world has to offer.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.884
<i>From which I'll never roam</i>

19:37.480 --> 19:40.245
<i>Who would? Would you?</i>

19:41.720 --> 19:46.647
You mark my words.
A small-town boy, a small-town life...

19:46.840 --> 19:48.490
it won't be enough for you.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.082
Rebekah, call me back immediately.

19:56.280 --> 20:01.127
I came to this dance because you begged
and now you're nowhere to be found.

20:06.680 --> 20:08.603
What is this?

20:10.440 --> 20:12.522
Your mother's back.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.967
- She does this all the time, right?
- What's taking so long?

20:29.200 --> 20:31.043
All boundary spells have a loophole.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.330
People are walking right out of the dance,
past the barrier.

20:37.520 --> 20:41.764
If Matt and I can leave, we can stop Esther
ourselves. We gotta find out where she is.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.610
Suicide, Jeremy.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.681
Suicide would be disappointing me.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.967
Now, work your magic, witch,
or I'll start killing people you fancy.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.731
- Let him go.
- Not until you get us out of here.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.446
Ah, don't be stupid.
Bonnie doesn't give a damn about us.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.928
The only reason she's helping right now
is to save Caroline and Tyler.

21:02.120 --> 21:05.329
Start killing people she cares about,
she'll tell us to go to hell.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.962
Ric, this isn't what you want.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.641
- It's not who you are.
- You don't know who I am, Elena.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.646
You only know the weakest parts of me...

21:25.880 --> 21:28.121
the man who lost his way...

21:28.320 --> 21:31.051
befriending vampires
instead of killing them.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.561
- You don't mean that.
- They're all monsters.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.003
The blood of their victims
is on my hands.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.842
Jenna's blood is on my hands.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.090
When you are ready.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.402
No, Ric, please, don't.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.684
Don't do this.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.685
I won't help you. I'm not gonna give you
my blood. You're gonna have to kill me.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.531
That won't be necessary.

22:19.760 --> 22:22.604
Drink. And let it be done.

22:23.920 --> 22:25.046
No, Ric, please, don't.

22:26.280 --> 22:27.406
No.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.771
- Is it finished?
- Not just yet.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.167
Here.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.727
Jeremy made a little blood donation
for your spell.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.287
I have to do this with you two
lurking over me?

22:55.480 --> 22:58.802
You're still mad at me for what happened
to Abby. Let me apologize.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.210
Sorry Elijah forced us to turn your mother
into a vampire to save Elena's life.

23:03.440 --> 23:06.171
- Didn't exactly have a choice.
- There's always a choice.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.448
Whenever you make one,
someone else suffers.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.086
Let's cut the dramatics and begin,
shall we?

23:26.440 --> 23:29.091
- Esther is fighting me.
- Esther couldn't possibly have...

23:29.280 --> 23:32.250
this much power
unless she's channeling something.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.169
A hot spot.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.247
Get the humans ready.
I know where she is.

23:38.440 --> 23:41.603
They're at the old cemetery.
Jeremy and Matt are headed there now.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.929
- You let them? They're gonna get killed.
- We didn't have a choice.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.566
We're useless right now stuck in here.

23:48.480 --> 23:49.970
Hey.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.729
She'll be fine. Elena always manages
to find her way through this stuff.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.446
Well, I'm just as worried
about what Esther's up to.

23:57.640 --> 24:00.610
She led Klaus here for a reason.
If she succeeds in whatever she's doing...

24:00.800 --> 24:03.007
Klaus could get killed.

24:03.520 --> 24:07.286
- And I die along with him.
- No one's gonna die. Okay?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.290
Bonnie's still looking for a way
around the boundary spell.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.641
It's not too late.

24:14.680 --> 24:19.129
So best-case scenario,
Bonnie gets us out of here...

24:19.320 --> 24:22.529
Klaus hauls ass to Timbuktu...

24:22.720 --> 24:27.009
and you and I, we're home free.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.841
Or we let Esther come and kill him.

24:30.880 --> 24:33.121
That's not a best-case scenario.

24:33.360 --> 24:38.400
That's not even
a remotely, heh, acceptable scenario.

24:38.600 --> 24:42.321
It would be an option if we knew he wasn't
the one who turned your bloodline.

24:42.520 --> 24:45.330
- You'd be safe. He'd be gone.
- How could you say that?

24:45.520 --> 24:48.490
Because I'm angry.
Because I hate him.

24:48.680 --> 24:52.162
- Should have never let him dance with you.
- What were you supposed to do?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.727
He can't know
that you're not sired anymore.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.570
Tyler, it doesn't matter how many times
I dance with him...

25:02.240 --> 25:04.129
I love you.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.691
He'll wake soon.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.850
When he does, he may, for a time,
be his old self.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.402
If so, you can say your goodbyes
before his transition is complete.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.687
You said you wanted to undo the evil
that you created, but this...

25:32.920 --> 25:34.206
This is just as evil.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.529
Alaric will never be
what my children became.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.321
I have granted him enough power
to complete his task.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.370
Then, when the time is right...

25:44.600 --> 25:47.080
- ...he will die.
- How? If he's immortal...

25:47.280 --> 25:50.966
All you need to know is when this is over,
we will have rid Earth of vampires...

25:51.160 --> 25:52.241
once and for all.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.609
Yeah, but you'll be killing the good
along with the bad.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.406
- You're no better than Klaus.
- Am I not?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.887
I desire a world where you
and your loved ones...

26:01.120 --> 26:05.603
will not suffer at the hands of
vampires, like your aunt Jenna did.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.204
Don't you dare use Jenna as an excuse
for what you've done.

26:11.600 --> 26:17.130
You may draw comfort knowing that your
aunt is not in the place that I was.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.565
She doesn't know the torment
of the other side.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.285
Though made a vampire,
she remained pure.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.485
And she knows peace.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.643
Which is all any of us can hope for.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.211
Don't move.

26:47.400 --> 26:48.811
Where's Elena?

26:49.040 --> 26:50.929
- Jeremy?
- Let her go.

26:53.360 --> 26:58.526
How foolish of you to risk your lives
in defense of those who will kill you.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.006
But if that is your choice.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.168
- Matt. Matt, drop your gun.
- I can't.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.721
- I'm not controlling it.
- Esther, stop it.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.521
Oh, my God.

27:34.440 --> 27:35.566
Where's my ring?

27:39.560 --> 27:41.050
Tell me what happened.

27:46.640 --> 27:48.847
You know, this is your fault.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.611
You set us on this path
when you released my mother.

27:52.440 --> 27:55.125
I wonder if revenge
will prove worth the cost.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.010
Oh, I'm done with revenge.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.770
As far as Esther...

27:58.960 --> 28:01.042
we've stopped her before.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.841
- We'll stop her again.
- We are strange bedfellows, you and I.

28:05.040 --> 28:08.010
All of this reminds me
of our time together in the '20s.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.685
You say that like I'm supposed to have
happy memories about it.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.402
Well, there were moments.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.645
Real friendship.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.042
- Brotherhood.
- Well, he already has a brother.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.010
Not to be, you know,
territorial or anything.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.808
Oh, no, of course.
The Salvatores and their unshakable bond.

28:31.240 --> 28:34.608
I wonder what will happen
when Elena finally makes her choice.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.724
Will we see you shake just a little bit?

28:46.160 --> 28:47.924
It's done.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.841
Esther's not fighting me anymore.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.571
The boundary spell is broken.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.723
Thank you, Bonnie.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.446
For everything.

29:02.560 --> 29:04.608
I didn't do it for you.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.644
Damon's here.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.241
And Klaus took Esther's body.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.164
- Does he know about the stake?
- No.

29:18.400 --> 29:21.085
Only that she tried to turn you
into a weapon and failed.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.165
- What's going on?
- Listen, Jeremy.

29:32.320 --> 29:34.163
I'm not gonna complete the transition.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.805
My dark side was dangerous enough
as a human.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.164
I can't be a vampire.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.045
So what? We're gonna lock you in here
and let you die?

29:50.600 --> 29:53.809
- No. No, we can't.
- Listen, Jeremy, it's the right thing to do.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.321
Okay? After everything
that's happened, after...

29:57.440 --> 29:58.885
After all that I've done...

30:01.520 --> 30:02.851
maybe I had it coming.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.646
Hey, wait, Jer.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.971
Alaric, this isn't your fault.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.443
Please, guys, let's not make this
any harder than it already is.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.685
You two should go.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.525
Damon's here.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.327
He'll make sure
it'll all go down the right way.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.169
- Hey. Hey.
- Don't.

30:31.680 --> 30:35.446
Don't give me some crap speech about
how I need to be the man of the house.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.325
Okay.

30:40.760 --> 30:42.444
I won't.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.569
This is all my fault.

31:02.480 --> 31:05.848
You moved out.
You gave me your ring back.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.726
You didn't want any part of this and I...

31:08.920 --> 31:12.641
- I forced you to stay and take care of us.
- Don't do that.

31:13.440 --> 31:18.571
Okay? Taking care of you and Jeremy
has been...

31:20.160 --> 31:24.006
It's been the closest I've ever come
to the life I always wanted.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.282
Elena, you should go.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.370
Your trap failed, Mother.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.846
I live, and I will go on living.

33:25.040 --> 33:28.726
Let your beloved spirits
try to preserve you again.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.686
I dare you to come after me.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.451
I will build an army so big...

33:35.640 --> 33:38.371
no one will ever touch me.

33:38.760 --> 33:43.163
My survival
will haunt you through eternity.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.001
You will never destroy me!

33:57.400 --> 34:00.324
- Thanks for the ride home.
- No problem.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.002
There's nothing you could have done.

34:04.200 --> 34:05.884
I know.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.483
That doesn't make it any easier.

34:10.600 --> 34:13.126
I should have said this before...

34:14.080 --> 34:16.650
but thank you for protecting me.

34:21.679 --> 34:24.411
Apparently, it's what I do.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.931
You really are pretty amazing.

34:30.280 --> 34:33.966
Sometimes I think I'd settle
for just ordinary.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.967
You said your dad's out of town, right?

34:38.880 --> 34:40.324
You gonna be okay by yourself?

34:44.159 --> 34:45.730
No.

34:47.199 --> 34:49.043
I don't think I am.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.204
Mr. Saltzman.

35:14.920 --> 35:16.285
Alaric.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.570
You can handle this later.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.603
No, I'd rather get it over with now...

35:39.800 --> 35:42.610
before some janitor comes to clean out
Alaric's stuff...

35:42.800 --> 35:45.804
and realizes the history teacher
was a vampire slayer.

35:46.720 --> 35:47.767
Elena.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.481
- Hey, Elena, please.
- I can't, Stefan, okay?

35:51.680 --> 35:55.526
I can't think about the fact
that Jeremy and I don't have anyone...

35:55.720 --> 35:57.529
to take care of us anymore.

35:57.720 --> 36:03.443
Or that we've lost another friend.
I just can't think about any of it.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.801
- I want you to come with me.
- I'm not done.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.240
Hey.

36:09.560 --> 36:10.800
Please.

36:25.160 --> 36:29.290
We were in this gym the night
Klaus compelled me to turn my feelings off.

36:31.040 --> 36:34.123
I thought I hit rock-bottom in the '20s...

36:35.280 --> 36:38.966
but after I bit you,
I never wanted to feel anything again.

36:42.480 --> 36:44.369
But someone...

36:45.400 --> 36:47.687
kept telling me that
it was okay to feel.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.646
No matter how much it hurt.

36:52.280 --> 36:55.602
That our emotions
are what make us human.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.242
Good or bad.

36:58.840 --> 37:00.569
And to never lose hope.

37:05.120 --> 37:08.363
Who gave you that horrible advice?

37:09.200 --> 37:11.601
Some girl I used to date.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.443
I don't have anyone anymore.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.485
You have me.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.402
I gave him a sedative.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.008
He'll fall asleep first.
He'll go comfortably.

37:50.960 --> 37:56.205
Well, I offered to snap his neck,
put him out of his misery...

37:56.400 --> 37:59.210
- ...but he didn't take me up on it.
- You seem surprised.

37:59.400 --> 38:03.530
Well, you'd just think a guy so used
to dying wouldn't wanna drag it out.

38:05.480 --> 38:08.802
Well, it was nice of you
to give him the option.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.161
Mm-hm

38:10.360 --> 38:14.365
Apparently, my choices have been
a little controversial lately.

38:15.240 --> 38:17.129
You shouldn't leave him alone in there.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.369
That's what he wants.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.842
Is that really what you think he wants?

38:40.720 --> 38:42.961
Oh, Ric.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.488
Is this the part
where you give me a dream?

38:48.200 --> 38:51.409
Rainbows and rolling green hills.

38:51.640 --> 38:52.971
I was drunk when I told you that.

38:54.800 --> 38:58.202
Yeah, and I told you I'd
use it against you.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.488
Damn you.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.967
I'm sorry I killed you.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.447
Twice.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.164
So I have to actually die
to get a real apology out of you.

39:18.760 --> 39:19.807
Drink?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.163
Actually, I've been thinking about
cutting back.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.329
Yeah.

39:27.760 --> 39:28.921
This stuff will kill you.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.971
There you go.

39:58.040 --> 40:02.011
Your sisters need you
to finish what I started, Bonnie.

40:03.440 --> 40:08.651
Bonnie. Hey. Hey.
I think you were having a bad dream.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.488
What are you doing here?

40:56.560 --> 40:58.642
Hey. Bonnie.

40:59.320 --> 41:02.005
What, are you sleepwalking
or something?

41:03.000 --> 41:04.570
Bonnie?

41:05.840 --> 41:06.887
Aah!

41:07.080 --> 41:08.127
No.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.441
Bonnie.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.449
No!
