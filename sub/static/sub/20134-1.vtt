00:19.160 --> 00:21.970
<i>So I'm telling you,
you should read comic books.</i>

00:22.120 --> 00:24.043
<i>It's modern American literature.</i>

00:24.320 --> 00:26.846
<i>There's this guy who has this crazy dog,
or whatnot...</i>

00:27.000 --> 00:30.482
<i>...that can do all kinds of crazy stuff
with all his robot parts.</i>

00:30.640 --> 00:36.044
<i>Like, he can open cans, stop trains,
and reach through fences to pick flowers--</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:39.522
<i>Oh, all that's a bunch of hoolarky.
Stay focused on your work.</i>

00:39.680 --> 00:42.206
<i>We're supposed to be guarding
this convention, not reading the--</i>

00:43.520 --> 00:44.521
<i>Huh?</i>

00:46.320 --> 00:47.321
<i>Somebody there?</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:56.525
<i>Yo, friend, the convention starts
tomorrow. You isnâ€™t supposed to be in here.</i>

01:01.520 --> 01:03.329
<i>Careful, Jimmy.</i>

01:07.600 --> 01:10.046
<i>Tommy? What?</i>

01:25.560 --> 01:26.641
<i>Ugh.</i>

01:26.800 --> 01:28.131
<i>NU.'</i>

02:57.640 --> 03:02.521
<i>I'm telling you, Scooby-Doo, buddy, old pal,
like, the Blue Falcon is the greatest. Ho, ho.</i>

03:02.680 --> 03:07.481
<i>And don't forget Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.
He-he-he.</i>

03:13.080 --> 03:15.811
<i>Okay, gang,
when Scooby, who we're using as bait...</i>

03:15.960 --> 03:19.407
<i>...leads the manic Minotaur
of Manesly Manor into the trap...</i>

03:19.560 --> 03:22.530
<i>...you girls pull the levers
while Shaggy and I pull the ropes.</i>

03:22.680 --> 03:23.806
<i>All set?</i>

03:23.960 --> 03:27.169
<i>All except for the fact
that your bait is busy reading comics.</i>

03:27.320 --> 03:28.446
<i>- Who's it?
- What's it?</i>

03:28.720 --> 03:31.405
<i>Come on, Scooby.
We need the Minotaur to chase you.</i>

03:31.560 --> 03:35.167
<i>Uh-uh. I don't want to be the bait again.</i>

03:35.320 --> 03:37.084
<i>Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?</i>

03:37.240 --> 03:38.969
<i>Uh-uh. No way.</i>

03:39.120 --> 03:41.851
<i>- Would you do it for two Scooby Snacks?
- Nope.</i>

03:42.000 --> 03:44.606
<i>Would you do it
if Velma called you Dog Wonder?</i>

03:44.760 --> 03:46.524
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.</i>

03:47.200 --> 03:48.770
<i>Huh?</i>

03:49.560 --> 03:51.164
<i>Ugh.</i>

03:52.680 --> 03:54.170
<i>Hmm?</i>

03:55.120 --> 03:56.121
<i>Come on, Velma.</i>

03:56.280 --> 03:58.851
<i>You want to solve this mystery,
or don't you?</i>

03:59.000 --> 04:00.650
<i>All right.</i>

04:00.800 --> 04:02.529
<i>Dog Wonder, please be the bait.</i>

04:02.680 --> 04:05.570
<i>What was that? I couldn't hear you.</i>

04:06.360 --> 04:09.967
<i>Please, Dog Wonder. Go do your job.</i>

04:10.120 --> 04:13.329
<i>I'm Scooby-Don, Dog Wonder.</i>

04:13.480 --> 04:15.960
<i>Dog Wonder, Wonder, Wonder.</i>

04:33.400 --> 04:37.724
<i>I'm Scooby-Don, Dog Wonder.
Wonder, Wonder, Wonder.</i>

05:17.800 --> 05:19.006
<i>Wait for it.</i>

05:19.320 --> 05:20.924
<i>And now.</i>

05:31.560 --> 05:34.882
<i>- Huh?
- It's okay, Scooby-Don. You're safe now.</i>

05:35.520 --> 05:38.091
<i>It is my greatest honour and privilege...</i>

05:38.240 --> 05:43.565
<i>...to award you fine young adults
an honorary appreciation degree...</i>

05:43.920 --> 05:48.369
<i>...for capturing the manic Minotaur
of Manesly Manor.</i>

05:51.040 --> 05:54.362
<i>Shaggy, enough with the comics.
Pay attention. We're getting an award.</i>

05:56.960 --> 05:58.724
<i>Blue Falcon.</i>

05:58.880 --> 06:00.211
<i>And Dynomutt.</i>

06:03.720 --> 06:06.644
<i>Yeah, do you guys think
you could unmask me now?</i>

06:06.800 --> 06:08.404
<i>I've been hanging up here all night.</i>

06:08.560 --> 06:10.927
<i>This net really chafes
in all the wrong places.</i>

06:11.080 --> 06:12.206
<i>Sorry there, Mr. Bad Guy.</i>

06:12.360 --> 06:15.762
<i>It takes a lot to plan these kind
of award ceremonies, apparently.</i>

06:15.920 --> 06:19.481
<i>Let's see who's really behind
all the computer thefts.</i>

06:19.640 --> 06:21.563
<i>Horten McGuggenhiem.</i>

06:21.720 --> 06:23.165
<i>Yeah, yeah, like, big surprise.</i>

06:23.320 --> 06:25.846
<i>The geek with the glasses
was stealing all the computers.</i>

06:26.000 --> 06:27.490
<i>Can we wrap this up now?</i>

06:27.640 --> 06:30.450
<i>I suppose you all want to know
why I did it.</i>

06:30.600 --> 06:33.206
<i>Well, it all started back in my childhood--</i>

06:33.360 --> 06:34.691
<i>Nope. No, we're good.</i>

06:34.840 --> 06:36.763
<i>Don't need to know why.</i>

06:36.920 --> 06:38.524
<i>Like, take him away, officers.</i>

06:39.480 --> 06:41.482
<i>Thanks for coming. Bye-bye.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:46.601
<i>- What's the big rush, Shaggy?
- We got things to do.</i>

06:46.760 --> 06:49.081
<i>- And places to go.
- Let me guess.</i>

06:49.240 --> 06:52.847
<i>Does this have something to do with you
being a comic-book geek and a TV addict?</i>

06:53.000 --> 06:54.001
<i>Absolutely.</i>

06:54.160 --> 06:57.482
<i>I mean, like, no. But we are going
to the Comic ConApalooza.</i>

06:57.680 --> 06:58.681
<i>Hon, hon.</i>

06:58.840 --> 07:00.171
<i>Held every July.</i>

07:00.320 --> 07:05.087
<i>In the heart of beautiful
downtown San De Pedro in California.</i>

07:05.240 --> 07:07.641
<i>So exciting.</i>

07:11.320 --> 07:13.971
<i>- Hoo-hoo-hoo. Hurry.
- Fred, grab the wheel...</i>

07:14.120 --> 07:15.610
<i>...and let's, like, hit the road.</i>

07:15.760 --> 07:18.206
<i>We can't be late, dude.</i>

07:30.800 --> 07:32.768
<i>Well, my trusty hound...</i>

07:32.920 --> 07:37.164
<i>...it appears that our art show
has been a resounding success</i>

07:38.520 --> 07:39.965
<i>It's the Falcon Flash.</i>

07:41.120 --> 07:44.442
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
something unexpected has come up.</i>

07:44.600 --> 07:48.400
<i>I'm afraid the an show is over.</i>

07:48.720 --> 07:52.441
<i>Not a moment to lose, Dog Wonder.
Quick, to the Falcon's Lair.</i>

07:52.600 --> 07:54.523
<i>You got it, BF.</i>

07:56.120 --> 07:58.009
<i>Here we go.</i>

08:05.600 --> 08:08.683
<i>Dynomutt, to the Falconcar.</i>

08:09.360 --> 08:11.124
<i>Blue Falcon.</i>

08:11.280 --> 08:13.248
<i>And Dog Wonder.</i>

08:13.600 --> 08:16.126
<i>Away.</i>

08:16.280 --> 08:18.362
<i>The Blue Falcon is just so cool.</i>

08:18.520 --> 08:21.091
<i>Played to perfection
by the one and only...</i>

08:21.240 --> 08:22.685
<i>...Owen Garrison.</i>

08:22.960 --> 08:25.531
<i>And Dynomutt is so amazing.</i>

08:25.680 --> 08:28.081
<i>And our costumes are, like, groovy.</i>

08:28.320 --> 08:29.401
<i>High four.</i>

08:31.360 --> 08:35.284
<i>Wow, you two, I've never seen you so
excited over something that wasn't edible.</i>

08:35.440 --> 08:37.522
<i>Oh, it's edible.</i>

08:37.679 --> 08:41.366
<i>Yeah. We made the costumes
out of string cheese and food colouring.</i>

08:42.799 --> 08:44.609
<i>We'll be the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt...</i>

08:44.760 --> 08:48.242
<i>...for Mega Mondo Pop! Comic
ConApalooza costume contest.</i>

08:48.400 --> 08:49.970
<i>And when it's over...</i>

08:50.120 --> 08:52.122
<i>We eat the costumes.</i>

08:52.280 --> 08:55.329
<i>- It's like two-for-one fun.
- It's something.</i>

08:55.880 --> 08:59.441
<i>We are going to win that costume contest,
buddy, old pal.</i>

09:03.160 --> 09:07.006
<i>I'm Dynomutt, Dog Wonder.</i>

09:18.360 --> 09:19.646
<i>I don't know, guys.</i>

09:19.800 --> 09:22.485
<i>That old Blue Falcon TV show
was pretty campy.</i>

09:22.640 --> 09:25.007
<i>But I got to say,
I'm really looking forward...</i>

09:25.160 --> 09:28.960
<i>...to the screening of the new, updated,
darker, edgier Blue Falcon movie...</i>

09:29.120 --> 09:31.964
<i>...featuring mega movie star,
Brad Adams.</i>

09:32.120 --> 09:34.646
<i>He's cute
in a dark, brooding kind of way.</i>

09:34.800 --> 09:37.724
<i>But you know what's even cuter?
Littlest Fuzziest.</i>

09:37.880 --> 09:40.611
<i>They're only the cutest collectibles
in the whole wide world.</i>

09:40.760 --> 09:42.649
<i>And I have an almost complete collection.</i>

09:43.160 --> 09:45.845
<i>I've printed a checklist
of all the various Fuzziest I own...</i>

09:46.000 --> 09:50.210
<i>...so I'll know exactly which ones to buy at
the Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.</i>

09:50.360 --> 09:51.407
<i>Please.</i>

09:51.560 --> 09:56.600
<i>Costume competitions, movie premieres,
obnoxiously cute collectibles. Ugh.</i>

09:56.760 --> 09:59.047
<i>I'm glad the convention
is supposed to be haunted...</i>

09:59.200 --> 10:01.089
<i>...by a horrible, mean, cruel monster-man.</i>

10:01.560 --> 10:02.925
<i>Monster-man?</i>

10:03.280 --> 10:04.520
<i>Yup. See?</i>

10:04.680 --> 10:07.889
<i>These two guards said
a crazy freak attacked them in the dark.</i>

10:08.040 --> 10:10.122
<i>- Smells like a mystery.
- No.</i>

10:10.280 --> 10:14.524
<i>It smells like a whole lot of Velma trying to
ruin the most important weekend of my life.</i>

10:14.680 --> 10:16.125
<i>But that's not happening.</i>

10:16.280 --> 10:18.203
<i>Nope. No way.</i>

10:19.320 --> 10:23.882
<i>You can use the laptop
after the convention. Hoo, hoo.</i>

10:24.600 --> 10:29.242
<i>Well, it looks like the world can rest easy
once again, Dynomutt.</i>

10:29.400 --> 10:30.890
<i>That's right, BF.</i>

10:31.040 --> 10:32.769
<i>And remember, kids...</i>

10:32.920 --> 10:37.209
<i>...it's the hero inside of you
that saves the day.</i>

10:39.960 --> 10:43.760
<i>Like, welcome to the Mega
Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.</i>

10:43.920 --> 10:50.121
<i>The greatest collection of comic books,
TV shows, movies, everything.</i>

10:55.920 --> 10:58.366
<i>Jinkies. The mystery's started already.</i>

11:03.320 --> 11:04.890
<i>It's the Crab Car.</i>

11:06.200 --> 11:08.202
<i>I love it. I love it.</i>

11:09.240 --> 11:10.287
<i>Hmm?</i>

11:10.440 --> 11:15.321
<i>I can see the only mystery around here
is why I'm even at this Mondo geek-a-thon.</i>

11:24.120 --> 11:25.531
<i>That's right, folks.</i>

11:26.840 --> 11:31.721
<i>This is the new and improved Blue Falcon,
starring Brad Adams.</i>

11:31.880 --> 11:37.887
<i>And a very new
and very dangerous Dynomutt.</i>

11:47.400 --> 11:50.210
<i>Like, Scooby, old buddy,
these guys are good.</i>

11:50.360 --> 11:53.204
<i>This costume competition
is going to be kind of stiff.</i>

11:54.520 --> 11:55.521
<i>I know.</i>

11:56.240 --> 11:58.322
<i>Like, you listen to me, Scooby-Don.</i>

11:58.480 --> 12:01.324
<i>You may not have
the best Dynomutt costume...</i>

12:01.760 --> 12:02.761
<i>No?</i>

12:02.920 --> 12:05.730
<i>...It may look and smell a little cheesy...</i>

12:05.880 --> 12:07.006
<i>It does?</i>

12:07.160 --> 12:09.447
<i>...but you have the heart
of a Dog Wonder...</i>

12:09.600 --> 12:13.082
<i>...and it's what's on the inside
that's most important.</i>

12:13.600 --> 12:17.730
<i>Yeah, the heart of a Dog Wonder.</i>

12:19.320 --> 12:22.369
<i>We'd like to enter the costume contest,
please.</i>

12:22.520 --> 12:27.447
<i>Yeah, he's the Blue Falcon
and I'm Dynomutt the Dog Wonder.</i>

12:36.280 --> 12:37.964
<i>Like, zoinks.</i>

12:40.360 --> 12:42.442
<i>Hey, Shaggy. Hey, Scooby.</i>

12:42.600 --> 12:44.648
<i>See you liked my Zorak mask.</i>

12:44.800 --> 12:47.963
<i>Special collectible,
complete with automated voice box.</i>

12:48.120 --> 12:50.521
<i>I didn't. I hate bugs.</i>

12:50.840 --> 12:54.606
<i>They go...and...and--</i>

12:54.760 --> 12:57.650
<i>We got it, Scooby-Don.
You don't like bugs.</i>

12:57.800 --> 13:01.566
<i>Gang, this is Hank Prince.
He owns my favourite comic-book store.</i>

13:01.720 --> 13:03.722
<i>I hang out there all the time.</i>

13:03.880 --> 13:06.531
<i>Even if Hank is a little creepy.</i>

13:06.680 --> 13:08.762
<i>Shaggy. Hey, Shaggy.</i>

13:08.920 --> 13:10.524
<i>Isn't this, like, the coolest?</i>

13:10.680 --> 13:14.127
<i>Yeah, Austin.
This place is, like, blowing my mind.</i>

13:14.280 --> 13:15.884
<i>What little there is of it.</i>

13:16.600 --> 13:18.125
<i>Shaggy, do me a favour.</i>

13:18.280 --> 13:21.727
<i>Can you and your groovy dog
watch my nephew here for a bit?</i>

13:21.880 --> 13:24.929
<i>I can't leave my booth
and he wants to walk the convention.</i>

13:25.080 --> 13:27.162
<i>Nada problemo, Hank.</i>

13:27.320 --> 13:30.529
<i>- Hey, what should we do first?
- I want to see the Blue Falcon.</i>

13:30.680 --> 13:33.729
<i>The big, mega-spectacular,
dark-and-brooding movie one?</i>

13:33.880 --> 13:34.881
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

13:35.040 --> 13:38.044
<i>I'm heading over there right now.
Come on, gang.</i>

13:38.200 --> 13:39.611
<i>Not that one.</i>

13:39.880 --> 13:43.043
<i>The original Blue Falcon.
Owen Garrison has a booth.</i>

13:43.200 --> 13:46.044
<i>Owen Garrison? Here? Where?</i>

13:46.200 --> 13:48.601
<i>Right over there.</i>

13:48.760 --> 13:52.401
<i>Owen Garrison, the original Blue Falcon.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:54.608
<i>And Dynomutt.</i>

13:55.160 --> 13:58.209
<i>Like, it's a dreamy dream come true.</i>

13:58.520 --> 14:02.206
<i>If you guys don't mind, I think I'll go look
for clues to this mystery about the--</i>

14:02.360 --> 14:07.127
<i>Uh-uh, shh. Like, what did I say about
ruining my fun? What did I say? What?</i>

14:07.280 --> 14:09.647
<i>That's a good Velma. Good Velma.</i>

14:09.800 --> 14:11.006
<i>Shh.</i>

14:12.440 --> 14:13.566
<i>I'll come with you, Vel.</i>

14:13.720 --> 14:17.520
<i>As long as you promise we can stop at the
Littlest Fuzziest booth I saw on the way in.</i>

14:17.680 --> 14:19.409
<i>Autograph.</i>

14:19.560 --> 14:21.085
<i>Autograph.</i>

14:21.680 --> 14:23.887
<i>Autograph.</i>

14:25.400 --> 14:27.164
<i>Hey, I'll take one.</i>

14:27.320 --> 14:29.800
<i>- Me too.
- Yeah, me too. Like, me too.</i>

14:29.960 --> 14:32.440
<i>We are your biggest fans.</i>

14:33.000 --> 14:35.571
<i>My biggest fans?</i>

14:35.720 --> 14:38.803
<i>Fans? I have no more fans.</i>

14:39.200 --> 14:40.201
<i>Uh-uh.</i>

14:40.360 --> 14:41.850
<i>We are your fans.</i>

14:42.000 --> 14:43.650
<i>Too late. Too late.</i>

14:43.800 --> 14:45.768
<i>It's over. Over, I say.</i>

14:45.920 --> 14:49.561
<i>Ever since they announced
that Blue Falcon movie's coming out...</i>

14:49.720 --> 14:54.681
<i>...the studio's done everything in its power
to downplay the old TV show.</i>

14:55.000 --> 14:57.651
<i>They even removed the reruns
from the air...</i>

14:57.800 --> 15:01.850
<i>...and they won't release my episodes
on DVD or Green-ray.</i>

15:02.160 --> 15:06.210
<i>Don't you see? No reruns, no residuals.</i>

15:06.520 --> 15:11.048
<i>Soon, no one will even remember
there was an original Blue Falcon.</i>

15:11.200 --> 15:13.089
<i>But I'll make them remember.</i>

15:13.240 --> 15:16.005
<i>I'll make them all remember.</i>

15:21.720 --> 15:23.802
<i>Hi there, kids. Want an autograph?</i>

15:24.400 --> 15:26.801
<i>- Uh, no thanks.
- What?</i>

15:26.960 --> 15:29.804
<i>Don't mind him, Mr. Garrison.
We still want your autograph.</i>

15:29.960 --> 15:33.885
<i>But, like, we'll come back later
when you're feeling better.</i>

15:35.320 --> 15:39.211
<i>Just walk away from the crazy man,
and smile.</i>

15:46.960 --> 15:49.406
<i>I didn't know collecting toys
was such hard work.</i>

15:49.560 --> 15:51.767
<i>They're not toys, Velma Dinkley.</i>

15:51.920 --> 15:53.604
<i>They're Littlest Fuzziest.</i>

15:53.760 --> 15:55.330
<i>This is very serious business.</i>

15:55.480 --> 15:57.482
<i>If you say so, Daphne Blake.</i>

15:57.640 --> 16:01.087
<i>But, you know, this whole
Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza...</i>

16:01.240 --> 16:02.651
<i>...confuses the heck out of me.</i>

16:02.800 --> 16:05.201
<i>In fact, comic books
and superheroes baffle me.</i>

16:05.360 --> 16:08.125
<i>They don't make logical sense.</i>

16:08.800 --> 16:11.326
<i>You wouldn't get powers
from a radioactive spider bite...</i>

16:11.480 --> 16:14.802
<i>...and wearing glasses wouldn't trick
anyone into not recognizing you.</i>

16:15.600 --> 16:19.161
<i>See? You'd have to be a complete idiot
not to know it was me.</i>

16:19.480 --> 16:22.643
<i>Daphne, quick, there's something going on
at the Blue Falcon booth.</i>

16:22.880 --> 16:25.087
<i>And bring your new friend.</i>

16:25.400 --> 16:28.131
<i>Really? Oy.</i>

16:29.160 --> 16:33.643
<i>Fans of Mega Mondo Pop!
Comic ConApalooza, welcome.</i>

16:33.800 --> 16:36.610
<i>My name is Jennifer Severing.</i>

16:36.760 --> 16:39.161
<i>You may know me as the writer,
producer and director...</i>

16:39.320 --> 16:41.687
<i>...of the Transmollyfier movies
1 through 5:</i>

16:41.840 --> 16:45.083
<i>Revenge First Strike,
Revenge Second Strike...</i>

16:45.240 --> 16:47.322
<i>...Revenge of the Revenge Seekers...</i>

16:47.480 --> 16:50.529
<i>...Seekers of Revenge
Against the Revenge Seekers...</i>

16:50.680 --> 16:55.208
<i>...and Big Robots Blow Things Up
to Gel the Ultimate Revenge.</i>

16:55.360 --> 16:56.930
<i>Hello.</i>

16:58.600 --> 17:02.605
<i>When the studio asked me
to put the Blue Falcon on the big screen...</i>

17:02.760 --> 17:05.161
<i>...I only had one question.</i>

17:05.319 --> 17:08.722
<i>Instead of a story,
can I just blow things up?</i>

17:08.880 --> 17:10.848
<i>And they said yes.</i>

17:14.280 --> 17:18.079
<i>So I give you, without further ado...</i>

17:18.240 --> 17:23.121
<i>Dynomutts Revenge...</i>

17:23.280 --> 17:25.009
<i>...Brad Adams.</i>

17:29.240 --> 17:31.163
<i>Greetings, everyone.</i>

17:31.320 --> 17:33.482
<i>As I've said in the press many times...</i>

17:33.640 --> 17:35.688
<i>...Blue Falcon has been very important
to me...</i>

17:35.840 --> 17:38.923
<i>...and it was an honour
to bring him to life on the screen.</i>

17:40.360 --> 17:42.601
<i>And I want to announce
that we will be screening...</i>

17:42.760 --> 17:46.685
<i>...the entire Blue Falcon movie
on the last day of the convention.</i>

17:46.840 --> 17:47.841
<i>Don't miss it.</i>

17:56.120 --> 17:58.487
<i>He's not so great.</i>

18:00.760 --> 18:02.205
<i>Over here.</i>

18:02.360 --> 18:04.727
<i>That guy up there is a fraud.</i>

18:04.880 --> 18:06.484
<i>A fraud, I tell you.</i>

18:06.640 --> 18:10.042
<i>I, and I alone, am the Blue Falcon.</i>

18:10.200 --> 18:11.326
<i>-Autograph?
-Aah!</i>

18:11.480 --> 18:13.562
<i>- Autograph? Anyone?
- Whatever.</i>

18:13.720 --> 18:17.008
<i>Take it. Take my autograph. Take it.</i>

18:19.720 --> 18:20.881
<i>Who's that guy?</i>

18:21.040 --> 18:23.520
<i>Poor Mr. Garrison.</i>

18:24.040 --> 18:26.407
<i>People, who wants to see the trailer...</i>

18:26.560 --> 18:29.166
<i>Dynomutt's Revenge?</i>

18:30.680 --> 18:32.330
<i>Yeah.</i>

18:35.440 --> 18:37.727
<i>Get that old fossil out of here, now.</i>

18:38.680 --> 18:40.523
<i>- Come on, Owen. You're making a scene.
- Aah!</i>

18:40.680 --> 18:42.330
<i>Okay, hold it right there.</i>

18:42.480 --> 18:43.970
<i>James Becker, head of security.</i>

18:44.120 --> 18:45.963
<i>I just want to make sure
there's no trouble.</i>

18:46.240 --> 18:47.810
<i>- I won't--
- No trouble, Mr. Becker.</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:50.201
<i>I'm Jack Rabble.
I share the booth with Owen here.</i>

18:50.360 --> 18:52.010
<i>I'll just take him back. No trouble.</i>

19:05.880 --> 19:09.089
<i>Looks like those criminals
finally got the message.</i>

19:09.240 --> 19:10.651
<i>That's right, BF.</i>

19:10.800 --> 19:14.009
<i>Crime always pays the ultimate price.</i>

19:16.960 --> 19:18.121
<i>Who's that?</i>

19:18.280 --> 19:21.045
<i>That's supposed to be
the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt.</i>

19:21.200 --> 19:23.487
<i>Like, that BF isn't even wearing a cape.</i>

19:30.080 --> 19:32.242
<i>Greetings, humans.</i>

19:32.400 --> 19:35.165
<i>lam Mr. Hyde.</i>

19:35.320 --> 19:40.201
<i>I was once like you,
but now I am so much more</i>

19:40.360 --> 19:42.203
<i>Let me show you.</i>

19:46.440 --> 19:50.525
<i>Like, that looks like Mr. Hyde,
Blue Falcon's worst enemy.</i>

19:50.840 --> 19:52.285
<i>That shot's not in the trailer.</i>

19:59.080 --> 20:01.651
<i>It is I, Mr. Hyde.</i>

20:01.800 --> 20:04.371
<i>And I am here in the flesh.</i>

20:05.560 --> 20:06.846
<i>It's me, Severing.</i>

20:07.000 --> 20:09.287
<i>Something weird is happening.</i>

20:09.440 --> 20:11.090
<i>No, good weird.</i>

20:11.760 --> 20:13.171
<i>This doesn't look right to me.</i>

20:13.320 --> 20:16.529
<i>Right. What are the chances
of this being part of the show?</i>

20:16.680 --> 20:20.446
<i>Like, somewhere between slim, none,
and let's get the heck out of here.</i>

20:20.600 --> 20:24.525
<i>Please pay attention
and watch very closely...</i>

20:24.680 --> 20:27.081
<i>...because I am here to teach you...</i>

20:27.240 --> 20:30.050
<i>...the meaning of fear.</i>

20:44.440 --> 20:46.522
<i>Fly, my children.</i>

20:46.680 --> 20:49.411
<i>Destroy everything you see.</i>

20:53.040 --> 20:54.644
<i>Look out!</i>

20:59.000 --> 21:01.048
<i>Look out, Scoob.</i>

21:03.360 --> 21:05.203
<i>In here.</i>

21:09.560 --> 21:11.767
<i>Like, good thinking, Scoob.</i>

21:13.160 --> 21:15.731
<i>-Aah!
- Aah! Run'</i>

21:31.000 --> 21:32.286
<i>That was close.</i>

21:32.440 --> 21:35.011
<i>Too close for the Blue Falcon booth.
Look.</i>

21:45.240 --> 21:46.890
<i>Those poor people will be crushed.</i>

21:47.040 --> 21:48.405
<i>Over there, the towers.</i>

21:48.560 --> 21:51.609
<i>Quick, you two take the one on the right.</i>

21:56.840 --> 21:58.205
<i>Nice save.</i>

21:58.360 --> 22:01.091
<i>But it won't spare you next time.</i>

22:01.240 --> 22:03.322
<i>Return, my lovelies.</i>

22:03.480 --> 22:06.211
<i>Return to your master.</i>

22:12.760 --> 22:14.808
<i>Everybody, stay calm.</i>

22:14.960 --> 22:19.329
<i>I have my security guards in there right now
searching for that freaky perp.</i>

22:19.480 --> 22:21.960
<i>Like, ow!</i>

22:23.200 --> 22:25.407
<i>You two, over here, now.</i>

22:25.560 --> 22:27.801
<i>I'm not going to stand by
while you wreck the place...</i>

22:27.960 --> 22:30.850
<i>...in the name of some crazy PR stunt
for your movie.</i>

22:31.000 --> 22:33.890
<i>Mr. Becker,
how dare you accuse us of this?</i>

22:34.040 --> 22:36.611
<i>Our fans are our most treasured asset.</i>

22:36.760 --> 22:39.047
<i>We would never do anything
to endanger them.</i>

22:39.200 --> 22:41.851
<i>No publicity is worth that.</i>

22:42.000 --> 22:43.490
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Becker...</i>

22:43.640 --> 22:47.326
<i>...but we're the Mystery Incorporated gang
and we'd love to look into this for you.</i>

22:47.480 --> 22:48.606
<i>It's what we do.</i>

22:48.760 --> 22:50.171
<i>We solve mysteries.</i>

22:50.320 --> 22:52.926
<i>- And run away a lot.
- And eat.</i>

22:53.080 --> 22:55.321
<i>So, what do you say, Mr. Becker?
Can we help?</i>

22:55.480 --> 23:00.247
<i>You kids were pretty impressive in there
with how you reacted to that emergency.</i>

23:00.400 --> 23:03.802
<i>Lives were saved.
But I can't let you get involved.</i>

23:03.960 --> 23:06.361
<i>Besides, I'm shutting
the whole convention down.</i>

23:06.520 --> 23:08.761
<i>I can't be responsible
for anyone getting hurt.</i>

23:08.920 --> 23:10.331
<i>It's just too dangerous.</i>

23:10.480 --> 23:13.484
<i>Don't you worry, folks.
As mayor of San De Pedro...</i>

23:13.640 --> 23:18.931
<i>...I would never let anything shutdown
the Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza.</i>

23:19.080 --> 23:22.562
<i>You listen to me, Becker. This convention
is the biggest money maker we have.</i>

23:22.720 --> 23:27.248
<i>But I can't ensure the safety of the people
with a maniac on the loose.</i>

23:27.400 --> 23:31.007
<i>If you need the help, why not take
these nice youngsters up on their offer?</i>

23:31.160 --> 23:33.561
<i>They've behaved so admirably already.</i>

23:33.720 --> 23:34.767
<i>And they're free.</i>

23:36.040 --> 23:37.724
<i>Because I believe in young heroes.
Ha, ha.</i>

23:40.240 --> 23:43.130
<i>All right, you can help.</i>

23:45.840 --> 23:47.205
<i>Fantastic.</i>

23:47.360 --> 23:51.684
<i>Gang, looks like we have another mystery
on our hands.</i>

23:54.240 --> 23:56.925
<i>All right, V.
What do we know about the monster?</i>

23:57.080 --> 23:59.321
<i>Don't look at me, Freddy.
Comics aren't my thing.</i>

23:59.480 --> 24:01.323
<i>Out of my area of expertise.</i>

24:01.480 --> 24:04.131
<i>Ask Geek-o-man
and his faithful sidekick, Hungry-mutt.</i>

24:05.120 --> 24:06.451
<i>She talking to us?</i>

24:06.600 --> 24:07.806
<i>I think so.</i>

24:07.960 --> 24:11.442
<i>- Do you two know anything about this?
- Uh-huh. A lot.</i>

24:11.600 --> 24:14.046
<i>That's right, Scooby-Don.
This Mr. Hyde character...</i>

24:14.200 --> 24:18.171
<i>...he's Blue Falcon and Dynomutt's
archnemesis in the old TV show.</i>

24:18.320 --> 24:21.369
<i>Willie the Weasel
was a small-time crook and inventor.</i>

24:21.520 --> 24:26.651
<i>He, like, created an experimental gas
that transformed him into a nightmare.</i>

24:26.800 --> 24:30.202
<i>Bringing out his terrible evil self.</i>

24:34.160 --> 24:37.209
<i>As Mr. Hyde,
he's a creature of pure chaos...</i>

24:37.360 --> 24:40.921
<i>...trying to turn the world
into a dark twisted place.</i>

24:41.080 --> 24:45.210
<i>If you two know so much about Mr. Hyde,
you should take the lead on this mystery.</i>

24:45.360 --> 24:48.842
<i>- Uh-uh.
- Yeah. Like, are you kidding? No way.</i>

24:49.000 --> 24:52.766
<i>Mr. Hyde is the monster that taught us
how to be scared of monsters.</i>

24:53.080 --> 24:57.244
<i>Regardless, I say our first lead would be
the movie producer, Jennifer Severing.</i>

24:57.400 --> 25:00.404
<i>She was acting a little too innocent,
if you ask me.</i>

25:00.560 --> 25:02.005
<i>Good call, Velma.</i>

25:02.160 --> 25:06.085
<i>She's having a party tonight.
Let's check it out.</i>

25:07.560 --> 25:10.404
<i>Hands off, you venal villains.</i>

25:10.560 --> 25:15.009
<i>I tell you, I don't need an invitation
to a Blue Falcon party.</i>

25:15.160 --> 25:18.687
<i>I am the Blue Falcon! Ugh.</i>

25:18.840 --> 25:21.161
<i>- Come on, old-timer.
- No. Let me go.</i>

25:21.320 --> 25:22.651
<i>That's twice now.</i>

25:22.800 --> 25:25.883
<i>I think that Garrison guy
is acting pretty darn suspicious.</i>

25:26.040 --> 25:28.168
<i>Ha! Like, no way, Fred.</i>

25:28.320 --> 25:30.163
<i>He can't be the bad guy.</i>

25:30.320 --> 25:31.890
<i>He's the Blue Falcon.</i>

25:32.040 --> 25:33.610
<i>Was the Blue Falcon.</i>

25:33.760 --> 25:35.171
<i>Motive enough right there.</i>

25:40.160 --> 25:43.050
<i>We're working for the mayor
and Mr. Becker.</i>

25:43.480 --> 25:45.323
<i>Split up and see what we can find out.</i>

25:53.120 --> 25:55.964
<i>- Anything you can tell us about Mr. Hyde?
- Who's that?</i>

25:56.120 --> 25:58.282
<i>The freaky freak
that attacked the convention?</i>

25:58.440 --> 26:00.442
<i>The Blue Falcon's archnemesis?</i>

26:00.960 --> 26:05.010
<i>Oh, I never studied the older Blue Falcon.
In fact, I've never even watched the show.</i>

26:05.160 --> 26:07.527
<i>Instead, I bring to the Blue Falcon
a clean slate...</i>

26:07.680 --> 26:10.126
<i>...seeing him as a divided soul
in an endless debate...</i>

26:10.280 --> 26:14.205
<i>...over the choices he's had to make
in a very real and dangerous world.</i>

26:14.520 --> 26:15.760
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

26:16.280 --> 26:18.123
<i>That the Blue Falcon is an enigma...</i>

26:18.280 --> 26:22.888
<i>...living a life trapped within
the impossibility of certainty.</i>

26:23.040 --> 26:25.202
<i>- Makes you think.
- You take that back.</i>

26:25.360 --> 26:27.681
<i>I don't have the slightest idea
what you just said...</i>

26:27.840 --> 26:30.366
<i>...but you'd better take it back, like, now.</i>

26:30.520 --> 26:32.887
<i>Come on, Shaggy.
Let's go see how the girls are doing.</i>

26:33.360 --> 26:36.125
<i>I don't have any idea
who this Mr. Hyde person might be...</i>

26:36.440 --> 26:39.649
<i>...but I think you should be questioning
Owen Garrison.</i>

26:39.800 --> 26:42.849
<i>It's no secret that he's threatened me
and the studio.</i>

26:43.000 --> 26:44.365
<i>He's quite insane, you know.</i>

26:45.080 --> 26:47.924
<i>Yeah, yo, the projects in turnaround
and Steven's interested.</i>

26:48.080 --> 26:49.206
<i>He loves the script, man.</i>

26:50.520 --> 26:52.284
<i>- Good.
- Oh, it's better than good.</i>

26:52.440 --> 26:56.411
<i>It's got cyborgs, dinosaurs and penguins.
Come on, everybody loves penguins.</i>

26:56.680 --> 27:00.287
<i>A $90-million opening weekend.
Yeah, a monster.</i>

27:00.440 --> 27:03.011
<i>Monster? Where?</i>

27:03.800 --> 27:07.009
<i>Oh, good grief. They're not showing
that awful trailer again?</i>

27:07.160 --> 27:08.446
<i>Hey.</i>

27:19.960 --> 27:23.328
<i>Like, where did that horrible actor guy go?
Brad Adams.</i>

27:23.480 --> 27:25.005
<i>And where's Jennifer Severing?</i>

27:25.160 --> 27:26.605
<i>Maybe security got them out.</i>

27:26.760 --> 27:29.001
<i>No time to worry about that. Look.</i>

27:31.960 --> 27:35.885
<i>Since my brutal bats were such a hit
at the convention...</i>

27:36.040 --> 27:40.443
<i>...I thought you pathetic people might enjoy
my Hideous Hyde Hound.</i>

27:49.000 --> 27:51.162
<i>Attack, my beauty.</i>

27:51.320 --> 27:55.006
<i>Teach them the true meaning of fear.</i>

28:04.920 --> 28:06.843
<i>Scooby-Don, run!</i>

28:07.000 --> 28:09.571
<i>Hey. He-he-he.</i>

28:27.920 --> 28:28.921
<i>Jeepers.</i>

28:34.000 --> 28:35.729
<i>Wait, where's Scooby-Don?</i>

28:35.880 --> 28:37.245
<i>He was right behind us.</i>

28:39.160 --> 28:41.401
<i>Scooby-Don, get out of there!</i>

28:55.080 --> 28:56.081
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

29:05.160 --> 29:06.810
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

29:10.920 --> 29:14.641
<i>Okay. That was a little strange.</i>

29:20.400 --> 29:23.404
<i>Did you see all those extra security guards
on the way in?</i>

29:23.560 --> 29:26.928
<i>Mr. Becker is clearly expecting
another Mr. Hyde attack.</i>

29:27.080 --> 29:28.570
<i>And why are we here?</i>

29:28.880 --> 29:31.087
<i>Because we're expecting it too, Shaggy.</i>

29:31.240 --> 29:34.323
<i>The best way to solve any mystery
is to be right in the middle of it.</i>

29:34.480 --> 29:37.086
<i>So, what's on the mystery-solving agenda
for today, Freddy?</i>

29:37.240 --> 29:39.811
<i>There's something I'd like to check out.
Come on, gang.</i>

29:43.480 --> 29:46.131
<i>Like, hold on a second, Frederick Jones.</i>

29:46.280 --> 29:48.681
<i>You're not thinking
what I think you're thinking.</i>

29:48.840 --> 29:51.810
<i>You think Owen Garrison
might be the bad guy.</i>

29:51.960 --> 29:53.724
<i>Like, you think he's Mr. Hyde.</i>

29:53.880 --> 29:56.645
<i>Shame on you, Frederick Jones.</i>

29:56.800 --> 29:59.565
<i>You have to admit,
he is acting very suspicious.</i>

29:59.720 --> 30:02.200
<i>I don't have to admit anything, ever.</i>

30:02.360 --> 30:03.805
<i>Oh, brother, here we go.</i>

30:04.720 --> 30:06.688
<i>Mr. Rabble, like, help me out here.</i>

30:06.840 --> 30:10.640
<i>They think Mr. Garrison is behind
this whole Mr. Hyde craziness.</i>

30:10.800 --> 30:14.202
<i>Owen? Not in a million years.
Please, don't think badly of Owen.</i>

30:14.360 --> 30:16.931
<i>He gets excitable sometimes,
but he would never hurt a fly.</i>

30:17.400 --> 30:19.562
<i>- There's no way he could be--
- Hold the phone.</i>

30:19.720 --> 30:23.725
<i>Jack Rabble? You're Jack Rabble?
I knew your name sounded familiar.</i>

30:23.880 --> 30:26.804
<i>You were the guy who used to build
those wicked amazing robots...</i>

30:26.960 --> 30:29.247
<i>...to compete on that game show,
Combat Bots.</i>

31:13.240 --> 31:15.641
<i>Thanks. It's nice to be recognized.</i>

31:16.040 --> 31:18.361
<i>These days,
I make my money signing autographs.</i>

31:18.520 --> 31:21.649
<i>The same with Garrison. In fact,
we've been sharing a booth for years.</i>

31:21.800 --> 31:24.963
<i>Not exactly glamorous,
but someday we'll be back in the limelight.</i>

31:25.120 --> 31:27.202
<i>Say, would you two like to buy...</i>

31:27.360 --> 31:30.204
<i>...a limited-edition
Jack Rabble Flame-o-Bot figure?</i>

31:30.360 --> 31:33.409
<i>It has custom robo-damage action.</i>

31:36.560 --> 31:38.130
<i>Um, nope.</i>

31:38.880 --> 31:41.850
<i>But does that remote-controlled
flying spy bot work?</i>

31:42.280 --> 31:43.645
<i>You bet it does.</i>

31:43.800 --> 31:44.847
<i>I'll take it.</i>

31:45.000 --> 31:48.129
<i>Come on, gang. I think it's time
we checked in with Mr. Becker.</i>

31:48.280 --> 31:51.568
<i>Go on ahead.
Like, Scooby and I have a little work to do.</i>

31:51.720 --> 31:53.085
<i>We do?</i>

31:53.240 --> 31:56.289
<i>I mean, we do.</i>

32:09.560 --> 32:11.403
<i>Want to share a doughnut?</i>

32:12.200 --> 32:14.328
<i>Like, this is serious, Scooby-Don.</i>

32:14.480 --> 32:17.927
<i>You know how important it is to you
to represent Dynomutt properly?</i>

32:18.080 --> 32:19.081
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

32:19.240 --> 32:22.084
<i>Well, it's the same with me
and Owen Garrison.</i>

32:22.240 --> 32:24.766
<i>He's the original Blue Falcon.</i>

32:24.920 --> 32:29.084
<i>When I think of watching those shows
as a kid and what they meant to me...</i>

32:29.240 --> 32:34.610
<i>...I can't imagine a world without Owensâ€™s
brave, heroic, honest Blue Falcon.</i>

32:34.880 --> 32:38.043
<i>And to think the others want to
investigate him in all this...</i>

32:38.200 --> 32:40.771
<i>...oh, man, it's just, like, too much.</i>

32:41.600 --> 32:43.489
<i>That's a good Shaggy.</i>

32:43.640 --> 32:45.404
<i>Come on, let's get to work.</i>

32:50.040 --> 32:52.202
<i>We've been over and over these.</i>

32:52.360 --> 32:53.566
<i>There's nothing.</i>

32:53.720 --> 32:56.485
<i>Sometimes there are clues
where you least expect them.</i>

32:56.640 --> 32:58.290
<i>Like right in front of you.</i>

32:58.520 --> 33:00.010
<i>We found clues.</i>

33:00.160 --> 33:03.482
<i>Namely, like, in the form
of some pretty obvious suspects.</i>

33:03.640 --> 33:05.881
<i>Your friends here were saying
that Owen Garrison...</i>

33:06.040 --> 33:07.769
<i>...was the most obvious suspect.</i>

33:07.920 --> 33:10.002
<i>Au contraire, mon frÃ©re...</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:13.363
<i>...which is, like, Italian for,
"Let me lay it on you."</i>

33:13.920 --> 33:16.764
<i>Observe what we observed
with our little friend here.</i>

33:16.920 --> 33:18.809
<i>Firstly, Jennifer Severing...</i>

33:18.960 --> 33:22.203
<i>...writer, producer and director
of the new Blue Falcon movie...</i>

33:22.480 --> 33:25.051
<i>...she has everything to gain by this.</i>

33:25.200 --> 33:27.009
<i>I know. I know, right?</i>

33:27.160 --> 33:30.289
<i>This whole Mr. Hyde thing
is working like gangbusters for us.</i>

33:30.440 --> 33:33.523
<i>Every media outlet is talking
about the movie now.</i>

33:33.680 --> 33:35.569
<i>We might have a strong opening after all.</i>

33:35.720 --> 33:39.088
<i>And if we do,
the studio will have me to thank.</i>

33:39.600 --> 33:41.602
<i>And then there's Brad Adams...</i>

33:41.760 --> 33:45.048
<i>...an actor stifled by a role
he doesn't want.</i>

33:45.200 --> 33:47.009
<i>This whole Mr. Hyde thing is a blessing.</i>

33:47.160 --> 33:51.006
<i>If it continues to draw attention away from
me, I can bow out of this stupid franchise.</i>

33:51.160 --> 33:53.242
<i>I'm an actor. An actor.</i>

33:53.400 --> 33:56.768
<i>I should be doing serious cinema,
not this lowbrow crud.</i>

33:56.920 --> 33:58.331
<i>I don'! even cry once.</i>

33:58.480 --> 34:00.642
<i>Last but not least, Hank Prince.</i>

34:00.800 --> 34:03.121
<i>His nephew mentioned
that Hank keeps sneaking off...</i>

34:03.280 --> 34:05.567
<i>...and acting very secretive
and suspicious.</i>

34:10.920 --> 34:15.164
<i>Like, he made three suspicious phone calls
in just the short time we spied on him.</i>

34:15.400 --> 34:18.051
<i>One right before the first attack.</i>

34:18.199 --> 34:19.929
<i>We checked the phone records.</i>

34:20.080 --> 34:22.367
<i>Wow, you guys, that's kind of disturbing.</i>

34:22.520 --> 34:24.920
<i>Impressive, but disturbing.</i>

34:25.080 --> 34:28.562
<i>Why don't you all wait outside?
There's something I want to ask Mr. Becker.</i>

34:31.639 --> 34:33.324
<i>Really nice work there, you two.</i>

34:33.480 --> 34:36.290
<i>You opened up this mystery
to all sorts of suspects.</i>

34:36.600 --> 34:38.806
<i>High four.</i>

34:38.960 --> 34:42.442
<i>I have to say, I kind of like it when
there's only one real suspect like Owen.</i>

34:42.600 --> 34:44.284
<i>Ixnay, Daph. Ahem.</i>

34:45.800 --> 34:49.327
<i>I asked Mr. Becker to give us
special all-access badges.</i>

34:49.480 --> 34:53.690
<i>Badges that'll let us into the green room,
for all the important guests.</i>

34:53.840 --> 34:56.206
<i>- Where they have...
- Catering?</i>

34:56.480 --> 34:59.324
<i>Well, yeah. I guess they do have catering.</i>

34:59.480 --> 35:01.642
<i>Big tables full of food.</i>

35:01.800 --> 35:05.168
<i>Food of all kinds.</i>

35:07.040 --> 35:10.362
<i>Velma, did you just intentionally get rid
of Shaggy and Scooby?</i>

35:10.520 --> 35:11.931
<i>In a word, yes.</i>

35:12.080 --> 35:14.731
<i>The prime suspect in all this
is still Owen Garrison.</i>

35:14.880 --> 35:16.450
<i>We really need to question him.</i>

35:16.600 --> 35:20.685
<i>I get it. Kind of hard to grill their hero
and accuse him of being Mr. Hyde...</i>

35:20.840 --> 35:22.205
<i>...with those two around.</i>

35:22.360 --> 35:23.486
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

35:24.320 --> 35:25.401
<i>Well, terrific.</i>

35:25.560 --> 35:28.131
<i>I mean, while you two do that,
I'll go look for clues...</i>

35:28.280 --> 35:30.169
<i>...over by the Littlest Fuzziest booth.</i>

35:30.320 --> 35:33.210
<i>See if this special badge
will get me a professional discount.</i>

35:34.000 --> 35:35.968
<i>Hey, get away from that table.</i>

35:36.400 --> 35:38.528
<i>- Those are mine. Mine. Mine.
- Hey.</i>

35:40.080 --> 35:43.163
<i>- Don't make me hurt you. I mean it. Let go!
- Aah!</i>

35:45.840 --> 35:48.286
<i>Take my identity, will you?</i>

35:48.440 --> 35:50.602
<i>I'll make you all pay, yes.</i>

35:51.320 --> 35:54.130
<i>Excuse us, Mr. Garrison.
- We were wondering if we could ask...</i>

35:54.280 --> 35:57.966
<i>...a few questions about Mr. Hyde, Severing,
and the new Blue Falcon movie.</i>

35:58.600 --> 36:02.127
<i>That Hollywood huckster, Severing,
and her boy toy Adams?</i>

36:02.280 --> 36:04.886
<i>Don't mention their names to me.</i>

36:05.040 --> 36:08.089
<i>I spent years trying to get
one of the movie studios interested...</i>

36:08.240 --> 36:12.564
<i>...in a Blue Falcon feature film,
but no one would even give me a meeting.</i>

36:12.720 --> 36:15.041
<i>Then Severing buys the rights
to the character...</i>

36:15.200 --> 36:17.009
<i>...and slaps me with an injunction...</i>

36:17.160 --> 36:20.050
<i>...forbidding me from ever wearing
the costume in public.</i>

36:20.200 --> 36:25.001
<i>And they're trying to make everyone forget
that my show even existed.</i>

36:25.160 --> 36:27.811
<i>Doing these lousy trade shows
in the Blue Falcon costume...</i>

36:27.960 --> 36:30.247
<i>...is the only income I have.</i>

36:30.400 --> 36:32.528
<i>Oh, but don't you worry.</i>

36:32.680 --> 36:35.251
<i>They'll get what's coming to them.</i>

36:35.400 --> 36:37.402
<i>Mark my words.</i>

36:37.560 --> 36:41.485
<i>Mark my words, they will pay!</i>

36:41.640 --> 36:43.802
<i>Well, that sure was borderline
incriminating.</i>

36:44.080 --> 36:48.005
<i>I'd say it was way south of the border
and deep in the heart of Guilty town.</i>

36:48.160 --> 36:50.367
<i>Scoob, old buddy, old pal...</i>

36:50.520 --> 36:54.047
<i>...some people want super-strength
or super-speed...</i>

36:54.200 --> 36:55.850
<i>...but not me, no, sir.</i>

36:56.000 --> 36:59.402
<i>Me? I just want a super-appetite.</i>

36:59.560 --> 37:03.451
<i>And you know what that means,
super starving sidekick?</i>

37:03.600 --> 37:05.090
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

37:06.200 --> 37:10.046
<i>Super-powered tag-team eating attack.</i>

37:27.680 --> 37:29.682
<i>All I'm saying is be ready.</i>

37:29.840 --> 37:32.161
<i>I want cameras rolling
for the next Mr. Hyde attack.</i>

37:32.320 --> 37:33.810
<i>And I want it all on film.</i>

37:33.960 --> 37:37.806
<i>It's perfect. Absolutely perfect.</i>

37:40.040 --> 37:41.041
<i>Hmm.</i>

37:42.360 --> 37:43.441
<i>The food's gone!</i>

37:43.600 --> 37:45.364
<i>All of it.</i>

37:45.520 --> 37:46.521
<i>You.</i>

37:46.880 --> 37:47.961
<i>You did this.</i>

37:48.760 --> 37:50.489
<i>Like, run, Scooby-Don.</i>

37:50.640 --> 37:51.801
<i>Get back here.</i>

37:59.880 --> 38:00.881
<i>Yikes!</i>

38:01.560 --> 38:03.449
<i>- Come on, Scoob.
- Shaggy.</i>

38:17.640 --> 38:20.086
<i>Like, it's locked.</i>

38:20.360 --> 38:22.681
<i>I'm scared, Shaggy-</i>

38:22.840 --> 38:24.365
<i>Like, me too, pal.</i>

38:24.520 --> 38:27.171
<i>Come on, let's find another way out.</i>

38:30.000 --> 38:31.001
<i>You won't believe it.</i>

38:31.160 --> 38:34.562
<i>I found a Sparkle light Bear
and a Bubble fun Hippo.</i>

38:34.720 --> 38:38.645
<i>I am on a Littlest Fuzzier roll. Aah!</i>

38:41.080 --> 38:45.529
<i>Aah!
Is that a Blue Falcon Littlest Fuzzier? It is.</i>

38:46.360 --> 38:48.931
<i>I've never seen one in person.
They're so incredibly rare.</i>

38:49.080 --> 38:52.084
<i>All this Mr. Hyde mayhem
may have everyone on edge...</i>

38:52.240 --> 38:54.242
<i>...but it's sure been good for business.</i>

38:54.400 --> 38:57.643
<i>Old Blue Falcon stuff
is selling like hotcakes.</i>

38:57.800 --> 39:02.761
<i>I've been able to raise
my already-raised prices even higher.</i>

39:03.040 --> 39:07.250
<i>You'd think since my uncle's doing so well
he'd give me a raise, but nothing.</i>

39:07.400 --> 39:09.323
<i>I'm working this booth harder than ever...</i>

39:09.480 --> 39:12.927
<i>...especially with Uncle Hank disappearing
to run errands all the time.</i>

39:13.080 --> 39:14.445
<i>Hmm.</i>

39:23.960 --> 39:29.330
<i>Daphne, put the credit card down
and walk away from the Littlest Fuzzier.</i>

39:29.480 --> 39:31.244
<i>There's something you need to see.</i>

39:31.400 --> 39:33.721
<i>This is episode one
of the old Blue Falcon show.</i>

39:34.000 --> 39:35.764
<i>Look familiar?</i>

39:35.920 --> 39:38.651
<i>That's exactly what happened
the night before the convention.</i>

39:38.800 --> 39:40.245
<i>And look at episode two.</i>

39:42.200 --> 39:44.680
<i>Austin, what happens in episode three?</i>

39:44.960 --> 39:47.804
<i>- What does Mr. Hyde do?
- That's the one where he unleashes...</i>

39:47.960 --> 39:50.930
<i>...his Hideous Hyde Hound of Basket Town
on Big City.</i>

39:51.080 --> 39:54.289
<i>Hideous Hyde Hound. You don't say.</i>

39:54.440 --> 39:59.765
<i>Yup. And then I think Mr. Hyde's
next appearance is in episode 22.</i>

39:59.920 --> 40:02.651
<i>In it, Mr. Hyde floods Big City
with green ooze...</i>

40:02.800 --> 40:05.724
<i>...and it transforms the townspeople
into monsters like him.</i>

40:05.880 --> 40:09.646
<i>It's titled
Blue Falcon Versus the Psycho-ooze.</i>

40:09.800 --> 40:12.929
<i>I own over 17 turtlenecks
of the exact same colour...</i>

40:13.080 --> 40:15.401
<i>...so I definitely know a pattern
when I see one.</i>

40:15.560 --> 40:16.925
<i>We got to tell Mr. Becker.</i>

40:17.080 --> 40:19.287
<i>Let's move out, gang.</i>

40:42.360 --> 40:44.601
<i>Like, zoinks.</i>

41:15.640 --> 41:17.404
<i>Hmm.</i>

41:17.560 --> 41:18.925
<i>Mr. Becker?
- Aah!</i>

41:19.080 --> 41:22.050
<i>I already gave you kids
the all-access passes.</i>

41:22.200 --> 41:24.202
<i>Why are you back here exactly?</i>

41:24.360 --> 41:27.648
<i>Because, Mr. Becker, this is very serious.</i>

41:30.600 --> 41:33.331
<i>Quite frankly, kids,
I don't have time to worry about...</i>

41:33.480 --> 41:35.926
<i>...some stupid slime
that turns people into monsters.</i>

41:36.080 --> 41:38.970
<i>I still got to catch the clowns
who ate all the press food.</i>

41:46.120 --> 41:47.326
<i>Hmm?</i>

41:56.280 --> 41:59.841
<i>Scooby, this must be Mr. Hyde's lair.</i>

42:00.000 --> 42:02.048
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

42:03.320 --> 42:07.166
<i>He's got all kinds of floor plans
of the convention, and street maps.</i>

42:07.320 --> 42:08.481
<i>But why?</i>

42:08.640 --> 42:10.608
<i>Like, I have no idea, Scooby-Don.</i>

42:10.760 --> 42:13.889
<i>And why is this one marked
"alternate emergency route"?</i>

42:14.520 --> 42:16.124
<i>Hmm?</i>

42:37.640 --> 42:41.122
<i>Zoinks.
That's the psycho-ooze, remember?</i>

42:41.280 --> 42:43.169
<i>Episode 22.</i>

42:43.320 --> 42:45.721
<i>It turns people into monsters.</i>

42:45.880 --> 42:48.201
<i>What? Spies.</i>

42:48.360 --> 42:50.044
<i>Interlopers.</i>

43:17.280 --> 43:19.089
<i>We're trapped.</i>

43:23.080 --> 43:26.880
<i>To those foolish enough to spy on me...</i>

43:27.040 --> 43:31.170
<i>...taste the oozing chaos of fear.</i>

43:36.600 --> 43:38.204
<i>Like, don't let it hit you, Scoob.</i>

43:38.360 --> 43:41.728
<i>Yeah.
I don't want to be turned into a monster.</i>

43:42.040 --> 43:44.327
<i>Please, Mr. Becker,
you have to listen to us.</i>

43:44.480 --> 43:45.891
<i>The threat is real.</i>

43:46.040 --> 43:49.089
<i>Too real. Look, it's Shaggy and Scooby.</i>

43:49.240 --> 43:50.890
<i>And Mr. Hyde.</i>

43:54.320 --> 43:55.765
<i>Come on.</i>

43:59.640 --> 44:02.962
<i>Scooby, that way. The big balloon.</i>

44:15.720 --> 44:18.610
<i>Like, we got to get to higher ground,
buddy, old pal.</i>

44:20.680 --> 44:22.284
<i>Hey, ugly.</i>

44:23.920 --> 44:26.526
<i>You leave those two alone.</i>

44:26.680 --> 44:29.729
<i>Fools. You cannot stop me.</i>

44:42.360 --> 44:44.283
<i>You cannot escape me.</i>

44:50.680 --> 44:56.767
<i>You shall watch as all of the
town is turned into hideous monsters.</i>

45:19.160 --> 45:22.528
<i>It's the end, Scoob.
They're all going to be monsterized.</i>

45:23.240 --> 45:24.366
<i>Huh?</i>

45:24.520 --> 45:25.646
<i>Over there.</i>

45:28.360 --> 45:29.407
<i>City hall.</i>

45:35.440 --> 45:37.761
<i>You can hide from view...</i>

45:37.920 --> 45:41.402
<i>...but you cannot hide from Mr. Hyde.</i>

45:41.560 --> 45:44.564
<i>Go, my lovelies. Seek them out.</i>

45:49.080 --> 45:51.287
<i>Like, he's gone batty.</i>

45:51.600 --> 45:55.002
<i>And now for the finishing touch.</i>

45:56.440 --> 45:59.011
<i>It's a psycho tsunami.</i>

46:11.640 --> 46:12.846
<i>Gangway.</i>

46:15.040 --> 46:16.121
<i>Open up!</i>

46:16.280 --> 46:18.248
<i>Ooze alert!</i>

46:19.560 --> 46:20.686
<i>Help!</i>

46:28.400 --> 46:29.845
<i>Hurry, Scoob!</i>

46:30.000 --> 46:32.287
<i>We're not fast enough. Quick, jump.</i>

46:35.240 --> 46:39.165
<i>Like, whatever happens,
don't let it touch you, Scooby-Don.</i>

46:39.320 --> 46:42.369
<i>Shaggy, it's rising-</i>

46:45.800 --> 46:47.245
<i>Have no doubt, my friends...</i>

46:47.400 --> 46:49.880
<i>...we will get to the bottom
of this Mr. Hyde nonsense.</i>

46:50.040 --> 46:54.409
<i>Until then, I assure you,
everything is under complete control.</i>

46:58.280 --> 46:59.327
<i>Yes?</i>

46:59.480 --> 47:01.562
<i>Hey, this is Becker, Mr. Mayor.</i>

47:01.720 --> 47:03.961
<i>Hyde was just sighted
flying over city hall.</i>

47:04.120 --> 47:06.521
<i>You may be under attack.</i>

47:06.920 --> 47:09.400
<i>Well, now, I wasn't expecting that.</i>

47:14.200 --> 47:15.929
<i>Maybe we can climb our way out of this.</i>

47:17.600 --> 47:19.011
<i>And maybe not.</i>

47:28.080 --> 47:31.482
<i>- Scooby!
- Shaggy, I've been oozed.</i>

47:31.640 --> 47:33.483
<i>Me too. I swallowed some.</i>

47:33.640 --> 47:35.449
<i>It tastes like...</i>

47:35.600 --> 47:37.090
<i>Like...</i>

47:37.240 --> 47:38.366
<i>Pistachio?</i>

47:38.520 --> 47:40.329
<i>Sorry to have to cut this short, folks...</i>

47:40.480 --> 47:42.847
<i>...but something's come up
and I have to go to, uh...</i>

47:43.000 --> 47:44.126
<i>To the bathroom.</i>

47:44.280 --> 47:45.964
<i>City hall under attack?</i>

47:46.760 --> 47:48.285
<i>What next?</i>

48:19.080 --> 48:21.048
<i>No, Scooby. No.</i>

48:21.200 --> 48:23.567
<i>You've turned into a hideous monster.</i>

48:23.720 --> 48:25.484
<i>NU.'</i>

48:25.640 --> 48:28.291
<i>In the name of ham on rye!</i>

48:28.440 --> 48:32.365
<i>My friend, you shall be avenged!
Hoo-hon.-hon.</i>

48:32.600 --> 48:36.924
<i>It's just-- It's too, too horrible.</i>

48:37.320 --> 48:38.321
<i>Shaggy?</i>

48:38.480 --> 48:40.209
<i>I'm sorry, Scooby-Don.</i>

48:40.360 --> 48:43.967
<i>I'm so sorry that you are so incredibly
hideous looking.</i>

48:44.120 --> 48:46.122
<i>- Shaggy, I'm right behind you.
- Huh?</i>

48:46.280 --> 48:47.281
<i>Scooby-Don?</i>

48:49.320 --> 48:50.526
<i>Like, you're all right.</i>

48:50.680 --> 48:53.251
<i>- We're not monsters.
- Uh-huh.</i>

48:53.400 --> 48:55.323
<i>Of course, you're not monsters.</i>

48:55.760 --> 48:56.886
<i>You're nitwits.</i>

48:57.040 --> 48:59.611
<i>But the psycho-ooze...?</i>

48:59.760 --> 49:03.128
<i>You Mystery Incorporated nimrods
are fired.</i>

49:09.920 --> 49:11.922
<i>In a quirky Mist of the Mr. Hyde story...</i>

49:12.080 --> 49:14.526
<i>...city hall was ?ooded
with a strange ooze...</i>

49:14.680 --> 49:18.287
<i>...that later turned out to be
a harmless pistachio-?avored foam</i>

49:18.440 --> 49:19.965
<i>It's just terrible what happened.</i>

49:20.120 --> 49:23.329
<i>And if this had taken place at the
Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza...</i>

49:23.480 --> 49:24.925
<i>...it would've ruined everything.</i>

49:25.080 --> 49:27.287
<i>That's why,
due to the increased danger levels...</i>

49:27.440 --> 49:29.761
<i>...not to mention
the increased demand for tickets...</i>

49:29.920 --> 49:33.527
<i>...the Blue Falcon movie screening
will not be held at the convention centre.</i>

49:33.680 --> 49:38.607
<i>It will be screened in the San De Pedro
baseball stadium across the street.</i>

49:38.760 --> 49:42.924
<i>On the lighter side of this story,
check out the two so-called investigators...</i>

49:43.080 --> 49:45.560
<i>...who actually thought
they were turning into monsters.</i>

49:45.720 --> 49:49.566
<i>We found this security footage posted
on ScoopTube.com.</i>

49:49.720 --> 49:50.926
<i>--monster.</i>

49:51.080 --> 49:54.050
<i>No, Scooby. No. You've turned-</i>

49:54.520 --> 49:56.284
<i>Everyone is laughing at us.</i>

49:56.440 --> 49:58.010
<i>It's only Scoop Tube.</i>

49:58.160 --> 50:00.208
<i>I mean, how many people really saw it?</i>

50:00.360 --> 50:02.044
<i>Forty-two million hits so far.</i>

50:02.200 --> 50:03.486
<i>Oh.</i>

50:03.760 --> 50:07.401
<i>And it's gotten 3 million LOLs,
1.5 million ROFLs...</i>

50:07.560 --> 50:11.121
<i>...and one "BRB. Got to clean litter box.
Mom is going crazy."</i>

50:12.040 --> 50:15.169
<i>We're the laughingstock
of the whole world.</i>

50:16.760 --> 50:18.842
<i>Hello? Mr. Rabble?</i>

50:19.000 --> 50:21.924
<i>I didn't know who else to call.
Have you kids seen Owen?</i>

50:22.080 --> 50:26.051
<i>No, Mr. Rabble. Not since before
Mr. Hyde's last attack. Why?</i>

50:26.200 --> 50:29.568
<i>Oh, it's probably nothing.
Owensâ€™s probably fine. He does this.</i>

50:29.720 --> 50:32.610
<i>Goes off on his own and all.
Probably on a rant someplace.</i>

50:32.760 --> 50:34.330
<i>Don't worry.</i>

50:34.480 --> 50:37.723
<i>Okay. That was weird.</i>

50:38.200 --> 50:40.965
<i>Come on, Shaggy.
We still have a mystery to solve.</i>

50:41.120 --> 50:42.531
<i>You can't hide in here forever.</i>

50:42.680 --> 50:44.569
<i>You have to be seen sometime.</i>

50:44.720 --> 50:46.882
<i>Not without this paper bag on my head.</i>

50:47.040 --> 50:48.610
<i>Like, it's never coming off.</i>

50:48.760 --> 50:51.764
<i>It's kind of peaceful under here.</i>

50:51.960 --> 50:53.246
<i>Ha, ha.</i>

50:53.400 --> 50:55.448
<i>Still working out some of the kinks.</i>

50:56.200 --> 50:57.486
<i>Where'd Scooby go?</i>

51:00.680 --> 51:02.569
<i>Listen to me, Scooby-Doo.</i>

51:02.720 --> 51:06.361
<i>You've got the hear! of a Dog Wonder,
and that's what's important.</i>

51:06.520 --> 51:08.045
<i>I don't think so.</i>

51:08.480 --> 51:11.848
<i>I'm no hero. I'm a joke.</i>

51:12.120 --> 51:15.169
<i>I will be Dynomutt no more.</i>

51:15.320 --> 51:16.560
<i>Forever.</i>

51:26.440 --> 51:29.762
<i>Okay, gang, first thing we've got to do
is find Mr. Hyde's secret room...</i>

51:29.920 --> 51:31.968
<i>...that Shaggy and Scooby
weâ€™re talking about.</i>

51:33.640 --> 51:36.928
<i>Hold it right there, you kids.
I have strict orders from the mayor...</i>

51:37.080 --> 51:39.811
<i>...not to let you into the convention
for any reason.</i>

51:39.960 --> 51:41.610
<i>- But, Mr. Becker--
- No buts.</i>

51:41.760 --> 51:45.162
<i>You made him look like a fool
and that makes me look like a fool.</i>

51:45.320 --> 51:47.163
<i>You're out. Banned.</i>

51:52.360 --> 51:55.921
<i>Boy, it really stinks being shut out
of a mystery like this.</i>

51:56.080 --> 51:57.570
<i>We have to get back inside.</i>

51:57.720 --> 52:00.803
<i>I still have five Littlest Fuzziest on hold
in there.</i>

52:00.960 --> 52:03.486
<i>I mean, we need to solve this mystery.</i>

52:03.640 --> 52:05.688
<i>Hey, guys, could you do me a favour?</i>

52:05.840 --> 52:09.401
<i>I can't find my uncle. Could you tell him
I'm sneaking into the tech rehearsal...</i>

52:09.560 --> 52:11.562
<i>...for the premiere
of the Blue Falcon movie?</i>

52:11.720 --> 52:14.690
<i>Sorry, Austin,
but we've been banned from going inside.</i>

52:14.840 --> 52:16.729
<i>Banned? Like, no way.</i>

52:16.880 --> 52:18.450
<i>Way.</i>

52:18.600 --> 52:21.171
<i>I bet I could fix that. Come on.</i>

52:26.240 --> 52:28.163
<i>Why do I have to be the Rock Ape?</i>

52:28.320 --> 52:29.731
<i>Just go with it, Vel.</i>

52:29.880 --> 52:31.769
<i>I think we look great.</i>

52:34.920 --> 52:36.968
<i>They're with me.</i>

52:44.240 --> 52:46.163
<i>Now we need to find
Mr. Hyde's secret lair.</i>

52:46.320 --> 52:48.482
<i>We got to figure out
what he's going to do next.</i>

52:48.640 --> 52:51.120
<i>That's easy.
If he's going by the episodes...</i>

52:51.280 --> 52:54.727
<i>...in his next appearance,
Mr. Hyde transforms into a huge monster...</i>

52:54.880 --> 52:56.120
<i>...and destroys the city.</i>

52:56.600 --> 52:57.726
<i>Oh, no.</i>

52:58.200 --> 53:01.249
<i>Okay, I'm heading to the stadium now.
Bye.</i>

53:01.960 --> 53:05.248
<i>Come on, gang.
W need to search Mr. Hyde's lair.</i>

53:05.400 --> 53:06.925
<i>Thanks for helping, Mr. Rabble.</i>

53:07.080 --> 53:09.651
<i>But it looks like Becker and his men
were already here.</i>

53:10.280 --> 53:11.964
<i>I'm getting out of this costume.</i>

53:12.120 --> 53:13.451
<i>Me too.</i>

53:13.600 --> 53:16.683
<i>I'm totally burning up in this thing.</i>

53:17.880 --> 53:19.405
<i>Hold the phone.</i>

53:24.200 --> 53:25.361
<i>Huh?</i>

53:36.760 --> 53:39.889
<i>Looks like Mr. Hyde hacked into
the convention centreâ€™s security.</i>

53:40.200 --> 53:42.202
<i>Wow, he could see everything.</i>

53:42.360 --> 53:43.566
<i>And control the alarms.</i>

53:48.840 --> 53:51.366
<i>I'm sad and hungry.</i>

53:51.520 --> 53:54.046
<i>Really, really hungry.</i>

53:54.200 --> 53:57.568
<i>Yeah. Moping all day
sure builds up an appetite.</i>

53:57.720 --> 54:01.327
<i>Maybe we should get something to eat,
but not be happy about it.</i>

54:01.480 --> 54:02.891
<i>Yeah.</i>

54:03.040 --> 54:04.883
<i>Not happy-</i>

54:06.040 --> 54:08.202
<i>Look, it's the baseball stadium.</i>

54:09.080 --> 54:12.209
<i>Why would Mr. Hyde have
a camera there?</i>

54:16.200 --> 54:18.680
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, stay in line.</i>

54:18.840 --> 54:20.410
<i>The gates will be open soon.</i>

54:32.080 --> 54:35.607
<i>Testing. One, two, three. Testing. Okay.</i>

54:35.760 --> 54:38.366
<i>Can we put up the video screen?</i>

54:38.520 --> 54:40.045
<i>Great.</i>

54:40.200 --> 54:43.886
<i>I'll start by presenting our star,
Brad Adams...</i>

54:44.040 --> 54:48.090
<i>...who will then introduce
the new Blue Falcon movie.</i>

54:48.240 --> 54:49.366
<i>- Roll the film.
- Yeah.</i>

54:53.720 --> 54:56.451
<i>I think maybe Mr. Hyde
had this all planned.</i>

54:56.600 --> 54:58.011
<i>Yeah, by creating chaos...</i>

54:58.160 --> 55:00.208
<i>...he made the convention centre
too dangerous.</i>

55:00.360 --> 55:03.170
<i>And got the screening moved
to the baseball stadium.</i>

55:03.320 --> 55:04.890
<i>But why?</i>

55:14.680 --> 55:16.170
<i>That's right, Dog Wonder.</i>

55:16.320 --> 55:19.324
<i>I didn't even know
a body could explode like that.</i>

55:19.480 --> 55:21.209
<i>With enough dynamite, BF...</i>

55:21.360 --> 55:23.408
<i>- ...anything can explode.
- Hey, who's that?</i>

55:23.560 --> 55:25.528
<i>- Who's back there?
- Ha-ha-ha. True.</i>

55:25.680 --> 55:27.648
<i>There. Look.</i>

55:41.560 --> 55:42.766
<i>Aah.</i>

55:42.920 --> 55:47.209
<i>Come on.
All this chaos is starting to make sense.</i>

55:48.120 --> 55:49.724
<i>Awesome.</i>

55:50.160 --> 55:52.288
<i>This show is over.</i>

55:52.440 --> 55:55.171
<i>No one will see this film.</i>

55:55.520 --> 55:59.445
<i>No one. So says Mr. Hyde.</i>

56:25.520 --> 56:27.761
<i>Like, maybe while everyone's
watching the movie...</i>

56:27.920 --> 56:30.844
<i>...we can get some hot dogs
without anyone seeing us.</i>

56:31.440 --> 56:33.090
<i>Run!</i>

56:35.320 --> 56:38.005
<i>Like, the crowd's leaving
before the movie's even started.</i>

56:38.840 --> 56:40.444
<i>More food for us.</i>

56:40.600 --> 56:44.571
<i>Scooby-Don, old pal,
I love the way you think.</i>

56:49.080 --> 56:51.321
<i>Uh, maybe this was a bad idea.</i>

57:09.720 --> 57:12.041
<i>Oh, no. Look, it's Austin.</i>

57:17.600 --> 57:19.762
<i>Like, where's a hero when you need him?</i>

57:19.920 --> 57:20.967
<i>Huh?</i>

57:21.120 --> 57:25.728
<i>Remember, Scooby, it's the hero
inside of you that saves the day.</i>

57:26.320 --> 57:28.766
<i>Yeah. I can do this.</i>

57:32.440 --> 57:35.330
<i>Who are you supposed to be?
Captain Necktie?</i>

57:35.560 --> 57:37.244
<i>NO.</i>

57:37.800 --> 57:39.768
<i>Dynomutt.</i>

57:41.160 --> 57:43.162
<i>Scooby!</i>

57:47.480 --> 57:48.720
<i>Mr. Hyde...</i>

57:48.880 --> 57:50.848
<i>...face me if you dare.</i>

57:51.280 --> 57:54.329
<i>This show is over.</i>

57:54.480 --> 57:56.801
<i>No one will see this film.</i>

57:56.960 --> 58:01.682
<i>No one. So says Mr. Hyde. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

58:31.160 --> 58:33.083
<i>Ha! This is going right on the Internet.</i>

58:33.240 --> 58:36.244
<i>Scoop Tube fame, here I come. Ha-ha-ha.</i>

58:37.080 --> 58:41.005
<i>It's paper bags for the rest of our lives.</i>

58:43.680 --> 58:45.762
<i>Where are Shaggy and Scooby?
They saved me.</i>

58:45.920 --> 58:49.402
<i>While that crazy giant Mr. Hyde
was kicking their butts, I got away.</i>

58:50.200 --> 58:51.884
<i>They're okay, Austin. Don't worry.</i>

58:52.040 --> 58:54.520
<i>But we need to stop
that monstrosity now.</i>

58:55.080 --> 58:57.208
<i>Come on, gang. I've got an idea.</i>

58:57.360 --> 58:59.806
<i>We got a serious situation
at the baseball stadium.</i>

58:59.960 --> 59:04.284
<i>Alert the local authorities.
We need to clear the area and fast.</i>

59:05.760 --> 59:08.206
<i>This show is over.</i>

59:08.360 --> 59:11.170
<i>No one will see this film.</i>

59:11.320 --> 59:16.167
<i>No one. So says Mr. Hyde.</i>

59:17.200 --> 59:18.804
<i>Hey, you.</i>

59:18.960 --> 59:22.442
<i>Why don't you sit down and be quiet?
Some of us still want to see the movie.</i>

59:27.800 --> 59:29.450
<i>Now.</i>

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.921
<i>This show is over.</i>

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:20.084
<i>No one will see this film.</i>

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.962
<i>No one. So says Mr. Hyde.</i>

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:32.130
<i>Now let's see who this Mr. Hyde really is.</i>

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.321
<i>Owen Garrison.</i>

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.766
<i>So it was him.</i>

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.847
<i>Sometimes, the most obvious bad guy
is the actual bad guy.</i>

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.365
<i>Arrest that man.</i>

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.688
<i>What? Where am I?</i>

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.123
<i>How did I get into this robot
and this Mr. Hyde costume?</i>

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:07.728
<i>It's a mess down here.
Set up a roadblock on Stadium Street.</i>

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:16.046
<i>Attention, Car 47,
traffic is blocked on Stadium Street.</i>

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.249
<i>Use the alternative emergency route.</i>

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.450
<i>I'm innocent, I tell you. I am innocent.</i>

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.726
<i>Hold on now.</i>

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.611
<i>Owen might be a deranged,
cranky old man...</i>

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.685
<i>...out of touch with what the public wants
these days, but he's a fellow actor.</i>

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.922
<i>He could never have endangered
all these people.</i>

01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:37.085
<i>That's right. You must have knocked me out
and put me in that robot.</i>

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:41.404
<i>You and that horrible
producer-slash-director of yours.</i>

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.690
<i>Like I said, he's a deranged, cranky old man
who's out of touch, and he probably did it.</i>

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:47.808
<i>Take him away, officers.</i>

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.123
<i>Something sure feels fishy about all this.</i>

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.724
<i>Zoinks! Mr. Hyde's here.</i>

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:21.961
<i>Shaggy, we have to stop him.</i>

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.771
<i>Let's ride, Dog Wonder.</i>

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.921
<i>Pull over.</i>

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.442
<i>Yeah. Like, pull over, please.</i>

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.524
<i>I don't think I can keep this up
for much longer.</i>

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.608
<i>Get off, you stupid dog.</i>

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.604
<i>Hideous Hyde Hound, destroy him.</i>

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.000
<i>Low bridge.</i>

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.442
<i>Get out of the way. I can't see.</i>

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.763
<i>Move. No. No!</i>

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.041
<i>You, dog.</i>

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.045
<i>You are going to pay with your life.</i>

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.885
<i>Hideous Hyde Hound, attack.</i>

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:23.006
<i>Climb aboard, Dog Wonder.</i>

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:26.285
<i>Don't mind if l do, BF.</i>

01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.646
<i>Dog Wonder.</i>

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.962
<i>And Blue Falcon.</i>

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.004
<i>Away.</i>

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.963
<i>This is not good.</i>

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.010
<i>Not so fast, you creepy crook.</i>

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.606
<i>Stick around, Mr. Hyde.</i>

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:08.609
<i>You did it, Scooby-Don.</i>

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.441
<i>You're a hero. A real hero.</i>

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.649
<i>- Good job, Dog Wonder.
- Aww.</i>

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:22.690
<i>Austin, you're all right.</i>

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.043
<i>I was incredibly worried.</i>

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:26.281
<i>Where have you been?</i>

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:28.841
<i>I'm sorry I've been so secretive lately.</i>

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.209
<i>It's just that I was courting
this wonderful woman.</i>

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.681
<i>Her name's Nora Spinkleton.</i>

01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.162
<i>But I know and love her
as Princess Garogflotach...</i>

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.129
<i>...of the Kloxnicht Nebula.</i>

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.127
<i>I love you too, sweetness.</i>

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.443
<i>No, Hank, in Kloxnichtian.</i>

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.931
<i>Oh, right.</i>

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.484
<i>Thank you, Mystery Incorporated.</i>

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.331
<i>Thank you for saving my nephew.</i>

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:04.289
<i>How can I ever repay you?</i>

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:07.001
<i>Well, there is a certain limited-edition...</i>

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.243
<i>...Blue Falcon Littlest Fuzzier
I wouldn't mind taking off your hands.</i>

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.371
<i>But first,
let's see who Mr. Hyde really, really is.</i>

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.966
<i>Jack Rabble?</i>

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.686
<i>- It all makes sense now.
- It does?</i>

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.808
<i>Don't be so thick, you flatfoot.</i>

01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:28.364
<i>It's simple really. It all started years ago
when I was permanently disqualified...</i>

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:31.364
<i>...from Combat Bots because my robots
were deemed too dangerous.</i>

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.441
<i>One of them actually destroyed
the studio.</i>

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.282
<i>So I was banned.</i>

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.681
<i>Deprived of the one thing I loved...</i>

01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:58.367
<i>...making robots
who destroy other robots.</i>

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:02.803
<i>I was forced to eke out a pathetic living
doing these conventions.</i>

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.170
<i>Times got so tough, I started sharing a
booth with Owen Garrison to save money.</i>

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:11.326
<i>After years and years and years
of hearing Garrison complain...</i>

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:14.211
<i>...about not being able
to revive Blue Falcon...</i>

01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:17.091
<i>...and then about Severing
giving the part to Adams...</i>

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.483
<i>...I finally came up with this brilliant plan.</i>

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.644
<i>Using my knowledge of robots
and special effects...</i>

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.643
<i>...I created Mr. Hyde.</i>

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.850
<i>And a bunch of remote-control bats
and a remote-control monster dog.</i>

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.765
<i>I rigged robotic legs
to give me super jumping abilities...</i>

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.527
<i>...and fitted them out with smoke machines
to disguise my comings and goings.</i>

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:40.446
<i>I used knockout gas on Owen,
and put him in the giant robot...</i>

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.444
<i>...which was remote-controlled
by yours truly...</i>

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.682
<i>...in a master stroke of genius.</i>

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.208
<i>So Mr. Garrison really was asleep
in there.</i>

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.046
<i>But all this?
All this was just for a simple robbery?</i>

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.363
<i>Nothing simple about it, hair-boy.
I needed to divert traffic...</i>

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.684
<i>...so that armoured car would go down
an empty side street where I could attack it.</i>

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.811
<i>That baby held the proceeds from all
the entrance fees for the convention.</i>

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.406
<i>It was over 5 million bucks.</i>

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:08.846
<i>Hey, you kids.</i>

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.923
<i>I demand to know what's going on.</i>

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:15.169
<i>And who to thank for stopping Mr. Hyde.</i>

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.881
<i>Your heroes are right here, Mr. Mayor.</i>

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:21.203
<i>Owen Garrison, the original Blue Falcon...</i>

01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:24.569
<i>...and his faithful canine companion.</i>

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:26.850
<i>I always knew you had it in you.</i>

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.288
<i>Glad I hired you and your friends.
See? I believe in young heroes.</i>

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:32.645
<i>Take some pictures, boys.</i>

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.447
<i>It's not fair. I was so close.</i>

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:38.648
<i>So close to all that money.</i>

01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.689
<i>And I would have gotten away
with it too...</i>

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.082
<i>...if it weren't for you meddling kids.</i>

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:52.131
<i>You know how I'm always wanting
better dramatic parts?</i>

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:55.603
<i>Well, this whole thing has taught me
a valuable lesson...</i>

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:58.524
<i>...in what storytelling is truly all about.</i>

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.203
<i>Maybe storytelling should be more
than explosions...</i>

01:09:02.359 --> 01:09:04.089
<i>...special effects and publicity.</i>

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.564
<i>Maybe it should be about
how Owen looks so good in that costume.</i>

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:12.006
<i>I think I've got an idea for the sequel.</i>

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.970
<i>I'm standing in from of the premiere
of the Blue Falcon sequel...</i>

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.885
<i>The Return Begins Again.</i>

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.486
<i>It's just about finished,
and I, for one, can'! wail...</i>

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.120
<i>...Io hear the reactions
of those lucky viewers inside.</i>

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.002
<i>You may have me outnumbered...</i>

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.925
<i>...but I'm taking almost all of you
with me.</i>

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.001
<i>Take that, evildoers.</i>

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.051
<i>Looks like we got here just in time,
eh, Dog Wonder?</i>

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.690
<i>Sure did, BF.</i>

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.405
<i>The original Blue Falcon.</i>

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.485
<i>It can't be. Unless...</i>

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.449
<i>That means you-- You're--</i>

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.886
<i>That's right.</i>

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.603
<i>I'm your father.</i>

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.247
<i>And that means that Dynomutt
is actually...</i>

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.846
<i>Scooby-Don.</i>

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.091
<i>Like, old buddy, you are a real hero...</i>

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.766
<i>...and a real movie star.</i>

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.365
<i>Take a bow.</i>

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:40.284
