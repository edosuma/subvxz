00:02.403 --> 00:05.039
- OKAY, SEE THIS RADISH?
THAT'S GOING TO BE MARS.

00:05.073 --> 00:06.540
THAT'S EARTH'S
NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR HERE.

00:06.574 --> 00:07.775

MARIE WASHED THESE

00:13.681 --> 00:17.118
OR IF THEY'RE STILL DAMP
FROM TUESDAY'S GAME.

00:17.151 --> 00:19.120

00:19.153 --> 00:20.121
OKAY, I'M SORRY, HONEY.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.289
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

00:21.322 --> 00:22.823

DO ME A FAVOR.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.725
I'M CALLING CHANNEL 11.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.660
ASK THE LADY WHICH

00:26.694 --> 00:28.529

00:28.562 --> 00:30.264

00:43.577 --> 00:46.080
LADY PICKS UP A HITCHHIKER
WHO TURNS OUT TO BE DEATH.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.115
- AH, THAT'S A GREAT ONE.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.816
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD THINK
DEATH IS A BIG GUY,

00:48.849 --> 00:52.120
BUT HE'S A LITTLE GUY.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.121
GENIUS.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.190
- MY SHORTS ARE RIDING ALONG

00:56.224 --> 00:59.627
WITH SOME
OF YOUR FINE WASHABLES.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.229

01:14.875 --> 01:17.278

01:17.311 --> 01:18.512
DAD, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

01:18.546 --> 01:19.647
- HE'S WAITING
FOR HIS SHORTS TO DRY.

01:31.492 --> 01:32.726
WHERE'S MY POT ROAST?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.395
- OH, WELL,
THAT'S OVER AT MY HOUSE.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.764
- WHAT?
WHAT'S IT DOING OVER THERE?

01:36.797 --> 01:40.601
- OH, WHEN I SMELLED IT EARLIER,
IT DEFINITELY NEEDED SOME WORK.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.236
- WHAT?
- SEE, I DRAINED IT.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.472
AND NOW I'M READJUSTING
THE SPICES.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.208
- WHAT, YOU GOT IT UP
ON THE LIFT OVER THERE, MA?

01:47.241 --> 01:49.510
- MARIE, I MADE THAT ROAST
FOR COMPANY TONIGHT.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.479
- BUT LISTEN, CALL ME
LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.247
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
HOW IT'S GOING.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.715
- YOU DON'T NEED TO GO
INTO MY REFRIGERATOR--

01:54.748 --> 01:56.317
[all talking at once]

01:56.350 --> 01:57.451
- NO, I THINK
IT'S TIME WE SHOULD--

01:57.485 --> 01:58.586
MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.321
FOLLOW ME.
- HEY, WHAT ABOUT MY SHORTS?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.922
- DAD, NOBODY'S
GOING TO TOUCH 'EM, ALL RIGHT?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.357
- WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.226
- HELP ME NOW, PLEASE.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.495

02:07.528 --> 02:08.496

02:08.529 --> 02:09.730
- YEAH, YEAH,
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

02:14.368 --> 02:17.205
- RAY, AM I A BAD PERSON?

02:17.238 --> 02:18.606
- NO.
NO.

02:18.639 --> 02:23.444
- BECAUSE I AM HAVING
SOME BAD THOUGHTS.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.213
- WELL,
THEY'LL DO THAT TO YOU.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.480
- MY GOD, I JUST CAN'T
TAKE ANY MORE.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.349
LET'S JUST MOVE, HUH?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.617
- BELIEVE ME,
I WOULD LOVE TO, OKAY?

02:29.650 --> 02:30.651
WE CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.819
- WELL, WHEN CAN WE?

02:31.852 --> 02:35.689
- FIVE SECONDS
AFTER WE CAN AFFORD IT.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.226
- I-I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT
THAT I WOULD MISS

02:38.259 --> 02:40.428
OUR LITTLE APARTMENT IN QUEENS.

02:40.461 --> 02:43.431
- COME ON, THAT APARTMENT
WAS TINY AND CRAMPED AND NOISY.

02:43.464 --> 02:47.201
- YEAH, AND YOUR PARENTS WOULD
ONLY VISIT EVERY OTHER MONTH.

02:47.235 --> 02:50.238
- I LOVED THAT PLACE.
- I KNOW.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.306
REMEMBER, WE JUST HAD
THAT LITTLE KITCHENETTE?

02:52.340 --> 02:54.842
- YEAH, REMEMBER
THE COZY LITTLE BEDROOM?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.610
- YEAH, AND WE HAD THAT
CUTE LITTLE LOVE SEAT.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.879
- YEAH, YEAH.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.448
- OH--
[sighs]

03:00.481 --> 03:02.616
WHY DID WE EVER LEAVE?

03:02.650 --> 03:03.617
- HMM.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.623
- YOU ALL DONE, ALLY?

03:09.657 --> 03:12.860
MOMMY WILL HELP YOU, OKAY?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.496
OH, THAT LOOKS NUMMY.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.265
YEAH--MMM!

03:19.333 --> 03:20.601

03:20.634 --> 03:22.202
HA, HA.

03:23.471 --> 03:25.373
COME ON,
IT'S MY LAST YEAR.

03:25.406 --> 03:27.975
YEAH, GRAB ME THE ICE CREAM,
WILL YOU?

03:30.678 --> 03:31.645
- ICE CREAM.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.247
- YEP.

03:33.281 --> 03:34.882
- WE ONLY GOT THREE MORE.

03:37.385 --> 03:40.721
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T NEED A BOWL.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.590
- WE COULD JUST TIE IT
AROUND YOUR NECK

03:42.623 --> 03:46.360
AND KEEP YOUR HANDS
FREE FOR COOKIES.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.995
- OKAY.

03:50.331 --> 03:51.665
SO, HEY.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.767
TOMORROW'S
THE BIG SONOGRAM.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.802
GOING TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.604
- NO, NO.
I TOLD YOU.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.971
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN THERE

03:58.005 --> 04:00.741
BESIDES THE ICE CREAM.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.410
- OKAY, FINE,
I WON'T TELL YOU,

04:02.443 --> 04:03.711
BUT I WANT TO KNOW
THIS TIME.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.846
- MY MOTHER SAID
YOU'RE HAVING A BOY, OKAY?

04:05.879 --> 04:09.350
YOU'RE CARRYING LOW,
AND YOUR NOSE IS BULBOUS.

04:09.383 --> 04:10.518
- YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY

04:10.551 --> 04:11.952
NO MATTER WHAT
WE HAVE, RAY, OKAY?

04:11.985 --> 04:13.687
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
ROOTING FOR A BOY.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.023
- I'M NOT ROOTING.
- OH.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.725
- I'M--WE HAVE A GIRL,

04:17.758 --> 04:20.394
WHICH IS THE GREATEST GIFT
IN THE WORLD.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.296
TO WANT ANOTHER ONE
WOULD BE GREEDY.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.564
- [chuckles]
YEP.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.765
[knock on door]

04:24.798 --> 04:27.801
YEP, YOU'RE SUCH
A PHILANTHROPIST, RAY.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.370
- THAT'S ME.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.306
- HEY.
- HEY.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.477
- HI, ROBERT.
HOW ARE YOU?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.612
- UH, DO YOU MIND IF I HANG
AROUND HERE FOR A WHILE?

04:38.646 --> 04:41.349
- OH, SURE.
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.888
- I TELL YOU, RAYMOND,
YOU GOT IT ALL:

04:47.921 --> 04:51.425
A KID,
ONE ON THE WAY,

04:51.459 --> 04:52.526
LOVE.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.627
- OH, BOY.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.329
YOU AND JOANNE
FIGHTING AGAIN?

04:55.363 --> 04:56.997
- "AGAIN" IMPLIES WE STOP.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.532
KNOW WHY SHE YELLED
AT ME TODAY?

04:58.566 --> 05:00.834
I WAS PLAYING PING-PONG
DURING LUNCH.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.403
- WHAT?
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

05:02.436 --> 05:05.906
- I HAD FUN WITHOUT HER.

05:05.939 --> 05:08.876
- YOU KNOW, YOU TWO
HAVE TO TALK THIS STUFF OUT.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.445
- I TRY.
I'M VERY BIG ON COMMUNICATION.

05:11.479 --> 05:12.546
I CAN TALK A GUY
OFF A BRIDGE,

05:12.580 --> 05:13.781
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO MY WIFE--

05:13.814 --> 05:15.349
[jabbering]

05:15.383 --> 05:17.351
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S BAD.
IT'S BAD; IT'S BAD.

05:17.385 --> 05:18.652
OKAY, ROBERT,
IT'S BAD.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.490
- ALL RIGHT.
NO, NO.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.692
ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO
LET IT DRAG ME DOWN.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.360
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT ME,
I'M SURE THERE ARE

05:26.394 --> 05:28.662
PLENTY OTHER WOMEN
OUT THERE WHO...

05:28.696 --> 05:31.865
MIGHT.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.667
- LISTEN, I'M SURE
IT'S ALL GOING TO WORK OUT.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.603
- YEAH, WELL,
I HOPE SO FOR HER SAKE.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.405
SHE COULD END UP
A DIVORCED 40-YEAR-OLD

05:37.438 --> 05:40.040
LIVING
IN HER PARENTS' BASEMENT.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.442
[laughs]

05:44.545 --> 05:45.546
HUH!

05:49.116 --> 05:50.584
- HERE, OH, COME ON,
THERE YOU GO.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.719
YOU EAT YOUR POTATOES.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.454
MMM, SEE HOW GOOD THEY ARE?

05:53.487 --> 05:55.423
COME ON,
THESE ARE YUMMY.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.557
WATCH.
WATCH ME.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.625
MMM.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.892

05:58.926 --> 06:00.428
- YEAH, THEY'RE GOOD.
THEY'RE YUMMY.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.095
COME ON,
YOU LIKE POTATOES.

06:02.129 --> 06:05.499
AND LOOK, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN
TOUCHED YOUR CORN, COME ON.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.805
- HI.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.607
- HI, DADDY.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.908
- HOW DID IT GO?

06:14.942 --> 06:17.978
AND PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP
TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

06:18.011 --> 06:20.147
HOW'D THE SONOGRAM GO?

06:20.180 --> 06:21.682
- RAY, YOU ARE NOT
GOING TO BELIEVE--

06:21.715 --> 06:24.618
- NO, NO,
TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT!

06:24.652 --> 06:26.520
YOU-YOU'RE GIVING IT AWAY
RIGHT THERE!

06:26.554 --> 06:27.921
- I DIDN'T EVEN
SAY ANYTHING.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.791
- YOU HAD THAT "IT'S A GIRL"
LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.426
- DID NOT.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.094
- SEE, NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT IT'S A BOY NOW.

06:34.127 --> 06:37.731
- STOP YELLING!
YOU'RE MAKING ME HUNGRY!

06:37.765 --> 06:39.533
- I'LL STOP YELLING
IF YOU STOP TELLING ME

06:39.567 --> 06:40.968
WHAT THE BABY IS.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.202
JUST TELL ME
IS IT HEALTHY?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.203
- YES.
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.473
- AND--
- BUP-BUP-BUH!

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
- FINE.
OKAY.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.480
YOU'LL FIND OUT
IN FOUR MONTHS.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.147
- THANK YOU.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.222
SO YOU'RE--YOU'RE THINKING
OF NAMES NOW?

07:02.255 --> 07:03.991
- YEAH, A LITTLE.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.496
- ARE YOU THINKING
OF NAMES LIKE GEOFFREY?

07:08.529 --> 07:09.630
- DO YOU WANT TO KNOW,
OR NOT?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.164
- NO.
NO.

07:11.198 --> 07:12.700
NO.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.234
UNLESS YOU CAN'T REST
UNTIL I KNOW.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.869
- OKAY, COME HERE, RAY,
COME ON.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.137
JUST--

07:17.170 --> 07:18.539

07:18.572 --> 07:19.707
- YES, COME ON.
SIT DOWN.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.808
- YOU KNOW ALREADY,

07:20.841 --> 07:22.075
- JUST--

07:22.109 --> 07:24.478
LOOK AT THIS, OKAY?

07:24.512 --> 07:25.479
[clears throat]

07:30.984 --> 07:33.554
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL
I'M LOOKING AT.

07:35.923 --> 07:39.793
- OKAY, LET ME SHOW YOU
YOUR HANDIWORK.

07:39.827 --> 07:41.662
[clears throat]

07:41.695 --> 07:42.830
THERE'S A LEG.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.131
- RIGHT.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.966
- THAT'S ANOTHER LEG.

07:45.999 --> 07:46.967
- UH-HUH.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.969
- AND, UH--OH!

07:49.002 --> 07:52.005
WHAT'S THAT IN BETWEEN?

07:52.039 --> 07:53.641
- IS THAT AN ARM?
- IT'S NOT AN ARM.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.943
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
IT'S NOT AN ARM!

07:55.976 --> 07:58.512
I KNEW IT!

07:58.546 --> 08:00.113
I KNEW
IT WAS A BOY!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.915
OH, YOU DID IT, BULBOUS.

08:01.949 --> 08:06.720
OH, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE!

08:06.754 --> 08:08.956
A GIRL WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT TOO,

08:08.989 --> 08:10.023
BUT IT'S A BOY!

08:10.057 --> 08:11.992
HA, HA, HA!

08:12.025 --> 08:13.794
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
COME HERE, COME HERE.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.995
I GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.196
- I'M DIZZY.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.698
- COME HERE.
LOOK.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.601
COME HERE.
OKAY.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.236
THERE'S HIS LITTLE...SOMETHING.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.705

08:30.978 --> 08:35.048
THERE....IS
ANOTHER LITTLE SOMETHING.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.719
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:38.752 --> 08:43.223
- RAY, IT'S--
IT'S TWINS, RAY.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.291
- WHAT?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.193
- TWO BOYS.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.663
- WHAT, RIGHT NOW?

08:49.697 --> 08:50.898
- MM-HMM.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.868
- IN HERE?
- YEAH.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.540
ARE YOU HAPPY?

09:02.009 --> 09:03.076
YEAH.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.615
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.985
THIS IS--
IT'S FANTASTIC.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.354
I--SOMEBODY HAS TO SHOW ME

09:14.387 --> 09:17.290
HOW TO DO A CARTWHEEL
RIGHT NOW.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.291
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.927
- BUT HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.895
TWINS DON'T RUN
IN OUR FAMILY.

09:21.929 --> 09:26.066
I'LL BET IT'S 'CAUSE
I SWITCHED TO BOXERS, HUH?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.234
OH, DID I KISS YOU
ALREADY?

09:27.267 --> 09:28.802
- YEAH, BUT YOU CAN--
- MMM.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.370
OH, SHOW ME AGAIN.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.939
- SEE?

09:31.972 --> 09:33.306
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING--
- UH-HUH.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.042
- AND THERE'S ANOTHER
LITTLE SOMETHING.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.245
- AM I A MAN, OR WHAT?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.749
UH!
OH!

09:41.782 --> 09:43.851
IN SCHOOL, THEY USED TO PLAY
KEEP-AWAY WITH MY HAT.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.719
LOOK AT ME NOW!

09:45.753 --> 09:47.220
- YOU SHOWED 'EM, BABY!

09:47.254 --> 09:50.758
- HUH?
HUH, OH.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.359
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SHOWED ME
TWO SOMETHINGS,

09:52.392 --> 09:54.628
TWINS DIDN'T POP
INTO MY HEAD.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.396
FOR A SECOND, I THOUGHT MY SON
WAS GOING TO MAKE A LIVING

09:56.429 --> 09:58.165
WINNING BAR BETS.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.234
OH, THIS IS GREAT!

10:01.268 --> 10:03.904
- OH, HONEY,
THIS IS SO WONDERFUL!

10:03.937 --> 10:05.873
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS WAY.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.241
- WELL, YOU'VE NEVER GIVEN ME
TWIN SONS BEFORE.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.744
OH, THIS THE GREATEST.
IT'S THE GREATEST!

10:10.778 --> 10:12.279
EVERYTHING
I'VE EVER WANTED.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.215
IT'S LIKE I'M NEVER GOING TO
WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING EVER AGAIN.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.818
OH, NO.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.319
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:19.352 --> 10:22.055
YOU JUST GOT EVERYTHING
YOU EVER WANTED.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.991
- YEAH, BUT WHERE
ARE WE GOING TO PUT IT?

10:29.162 --> 10:31.031
- HERE'S A TWO-BEDROOM
APARTMENT IN ELMONT.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.666
- ELMONT?
NO.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.069
TAKE A LOOK.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.038
HERE'S THE TRI-STATE AREA.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.841
NOW, HERE'S WHERE
MY MOM AND DAD LIVE,

10:40.874 --> 10:42.843
SO ANYTHING
WITHIN THIS CIRCLE

10:42.876 --> 10:44.377
IS TOO CLOSE
TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.046
- RAY, WOULD YOU PUT THAT AWAY?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.280
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HERE
ANY MINUTE!

10:47.314 --> 10:48.281
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.683
IF MY MOM CAN COOK SAUCE

10:49.717 --> 10:51.051
AND GET IT TO OUR HOUSE
BEFORE IT'S COLD,

10:51.084 --> 10:52.252
SHE'S GOING TO BE OVER
EVERY DAY.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.754
UH-UH.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.823
WE'LL CALL THIS
"THE HOT ZONE."

10:55.856 --> 10:56.890
- I LIKE HER SAUCE.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.091
- LET ME FINISH,
PLEASE.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.393
NOW, ANYTHING
WITHIN THIS ZONE

11:00.427 --> 11:02.930
IS GOING TO BE ABOUT
A ONCE-A-WEEK VISIT, OKAY?

11:02.963 --> 11:05.298
NOW, HERE,
FARTHEST AWAY--

11:05.332 --> 11:08.168
BEST ZONE, RIGHT?
WRONG!

11:08.201 --> 11:10.370
'CAUSE IF WE MOVE HERE
AND THEY VISIT,

11:10.403 --> 11:13.907
THEY BECOME
OVERNIGHT GUESTS.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.347
OKAY, SO THE MIDDLE ZONE
IS OUR TARGET AREA.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.215
IT'S TOO CLOSE
FOR AN OVERNIGHT,

11:22.249 --> 11:23.817
TOO FAR FOR SAUCE.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.318
- WELL, SPEAK FOR YOURSELF, RAY,

11:25.352 --> 11:28.021
'CAUSE I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH YOUR PARENTS.

11:30.123 --> 11:30.891
[knock on door]

11:30.924 --> 11:33.727
TAKE IT DOWN, OKAY?
PUT IT AWAY.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.496
HI!
- HI!

11:36.529 --> 11:38.298
OH--
- OH--

11:38.331 --> 11:39.733
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:39.767 --> 11:40.901
COME ON IN!

11:40.934 --> 11:42.836
FRANK, HI!
OH.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.871
- HI, SWEETHEART.
HOW ARE YOU?

11:43.904 --> 11:45.472
- COME ON IN.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.007
- I BROUGHT YOU
SOME WHOLE MILK.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.977
ALLY NEEDS MORE CALCIUM
NOW THAT SHE'S WALKING.

11:50.010 --> 11:53.413
- OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.815
HEY!

11:54.848 --> 11:56.283
- HI, SWEETHEART!
OOH--

11:56.316 --> 11:58.251
- OOH, THERE'S ALLY.

11:58.285 --> 12:01.154
LET ME GET A FEW WHIFFS
FROM THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.323
[sniffs]
THERE IT IS.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.926
I'M SUCKING IN THE YOUTH.
THERE'S THE MAGIC!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.895
- DAD, DAD, YOU'RE SLOBBERING.
STOP.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.529
- OH, COME ON,
LEAVE HIM ALONE.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.531
HE'S CUTE.
YEAH.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.767
[knock on door]

12:13.801 --> 12:16.770
- GET THE DOOR, CUTIE.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.071
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.139
- HEY, ROBERT.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.808
- WHERE'S JOANNE?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.542
- NOT COMING.
WE HAD A FIGHT.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.245
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
SHE CATCH YOU SMILING?

12:25.278 --> 12:27.447
[laughs]

12:27.480 --> 12:29.016
- WE'RE GLAD
YOU'RE HERE, ROBERT,

12:29.049 --> 12:30.417
'CAUSE WE HAVE
SOME NEWS.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.185
- HEY, LET ME TELL 'EM.
LET ME TELL 'EM.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.221
- WHAT, WHAT IS IT?
- SIT DOWN, SIT DOWN.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.789
DEBRA WENT FOR
HER SONOGRAM TODAY.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.190
- OOH!
REALLY?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.258
- WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

12:38.291 --> 12:39.827
- TAKE A GUESS.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.161
- WELL, YOU ALREADY
HAVE A GIRL,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.263
SO WITH RAYMOND'S LUCK,
I'M GUESSING...

12:43.296 --> 12:44.364
A BOY?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.299
- NO.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.036
- A GIRL?

12:49.069 --> 12:50.938
YOU'RE HAVING
ANOTHER GIRL?

12:50.971 --> 12:52.239
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TWO GIRLS.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.475
[laughs]

12:55.508 --> 12:58.378
- UH--IT'S, UH--

12:58.411 --> 12:59.880
IT'S TWIN BOYS.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.882
- OH, MY GOD!

13:01.915 --> 13:04.784
- TWO SONS!
IT'S A DYNASTY!

13:13.961 --> 13:18.098
- WELL...
LOOK AT RAYMOND GO.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.599
- IT'S INCREDIBLE.
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.902
- OH, INCREDIBLE.
OH, HONEY.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.103
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

13:23.136 --> 13:24.337
YOU HUNGRY?

13:24.371 --> 13:25.505
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
YOU SOMETHING?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.841
- NO, NO, I'M OKAY.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.376
- 'CAUSE YOU SHOULD EAT
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

13:29.409 --> 13:30.377
- OH, SHE IS,
BELIEVE ME.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.345
SHE IS, YEAH.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.214
- 'CAUSE IF A PREGNANT WOMAN
CRAVES SOMETHING

13:34.247 --> 13:35.282
AND DOESN'T GET IT,

13:35.315 --> 13:36.583
THE BABY'S BORN
WITH A BIRTHMARK

13:36.616 --> 13:38.185
SHAPED JUST LIKE
THAT FOOD.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.289
- THAT'S WHY RAY
HAS A BIG CANNOLI

13:42.322 --> 13:43.523
ON HIS ASS.

13:47.294 --> 13:51.164
- [laughs]

13:51.198 --> 13:53.633
I'LL BRING YOU OVER
A MEATLOAF TOMORROW.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.068
- OH, I WOULD
LOVE THAT, MARIE,

13:55.102 --> 13:56.636
BUT, YOU KNOW, RAY AND I
ARE GOING TO GO LOOK

13:56.669 --> 13:58.571
AT SOME BIGGER
APARTMENTS TOMORROW.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.573
- HEY, HEY, WHAT'S THAT,
YOU'RE MOVING?

14:00.607 --> 14:02.075
- WHY DON'T YOU USE
YOUR FATHER?

14:02.109 --> 14:03.977
HE STILL HAS
HIS BROKER'S LICENSE.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.178
- YEAH, I GOT
A LITTLE HOUSE

14:05.212 --> 14:06.914
THAT'D BE JUST
PERFECT FOR YOU.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.049
- A HOUSE?
- SURE, A HOUSE.

14:09.082 --> 14:12.019
PICKET FENCE,
TWIN BOYS--

14:12.052 --> 14:13.520
WHAT A PRETTY PICTURE.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.890
- I GOT A LITTLE EXCLUSIVE
THAT FELL RIGHT INTO MY LAP.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.625
- YEAH, DAD, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR HOUSES.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.993
- WELL, WHY NOT?

14:20.027 --> 14:21.128
- WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.162
- WHAT AFFORD?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.997
NO MONEY DOWN,
NO POINTS,

14:24.031 --> 14:25.432
BALLOON AT THE END.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.367
SIEGFRIED AND ROY
WILL BE OUT OF SCHOOL

14:27.400 --> 14:28.601
BEFORE YOU MAKE
YOUR FIRST PAYMENT.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.403
- WHERE IS IT?

14:30.437 --> 14:32.339
- IT'S IN A GREAT NEIGHBORHOOD
OUT ON THE ISLAND.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.441
- SIEGFRIED AND ROY?

14:34.474 --> 14:37.110
- IT'S A GREAT PLACE
TO RAISE KIDS.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.046
- OH, MY GOD, RAY,
WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.448
- YEAH, GOOD SCHOOLS,
EASY COMMUTE.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.216
- I GUESS IT WOULDN'T HURT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.918
- THAT'S WONDERFUL!

14:44.952 --> 14:46.619
AND YOU'LL NEVER FIND
BETTER NEIGHBORS,

14:46.653 --> 14:50.623
I MEAN, THAN THE COUPLE
THAT LIVE ACROSS THE STREET.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.925
- UH, WHO ARE THEY?

14:57.497 --> 14:58.531
YOU'RE KIDDING.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.532
- NO.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.268
- YEAH--

15:08.641 --> 15:10.110
- HOW ABOUT THAT YARD?

15:10.143 --> 15:13.046
- OH, IT'S NICE.
REALLY BIG, FRANK.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.414
- NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT
IN A KID'S LIFE

15:14.447 --> 15:16.316
THAN A BIG BACKYARD.

15:16.349 --> 15:20.320
PITCH A TENT,
BURY A CAT--

15:20.353 --> 15:21.488
REMEMBER WHISKERS?

15:21.521 --> 15:22.990
- YEAH, DAD.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.191
- STILL IN OUR YARD

15:24.224 --> 15:26.126
IF YOU WANT TO PAY
YOUR RESPECTS.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.597
- IT'S REALLY
A GREAT HOUSE, FRANK.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.332
- YEAH, AND WE'RE
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.401
YOU KNOW THE THREE RULES
OF REAL ESTATE--

15:34.434 --> 15:37.604
LOCATION, LOCATION,
LOCATION!

15:37.637 --> 15:39.406
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH,
GREAT LOCATION.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.174
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T I JUST
TALK TO DEBRA

15:41.208 --> 15:42.742
FOR A MINUTE OR TWO?

15:42.775 --> 15:44.477
- OKAY, OKAY,
YOU GO AHEAD.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.646
I'LL JUST GO UPSTAIRS
AND TURN THE LIGHTS OFF

15:46.679 --> 15:48.448
BEFORE WE LOCK UP.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.018
HELP YOURSELF
TO COFFEE AND DONUTS.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.053
THEY'RE COMPLIMENTARY.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.163
- YOU KNOW, WE--

16:03.196 --> 16:05.465
WE MIGHT NOT HAVE TO MOVE,
REALLY.

16:05.498 --> 16:06.466
- WHA--

16:06.499 --> 16:07.567
WE NEED A BIGGER PLACE, RAY.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.701
WE'RE HAVING TWINS.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.538
- WELL, HOW BIG A PLACE
DO THEY NEED?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.406
LOOK WHERE THEY LIVE NOW.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.709
- CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING?

16:16.743 --> 16:19.079
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO
GET OVER YOUR PARENTS?

16:19.112 --> 16:21.281
- DEBRA, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY'RE LIKE.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.749
THEY'RE GOING TO
GET YOU TOO.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.652
- I KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE LIKE, RAY.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.420
THEY'RE VERY NICE PEOPLE.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.790
- NO!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.225
YOU ONLY SEE THEM
EVERY OTHER MONTH.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.326
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.295
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.097
COMPLETELY OVERREACTING.

16:40.633 --> 16:42.469
- CLOSE YOUR EYES
FOR A SECOND.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.736
- WHY?
- JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.073
I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.440
BOINK!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:47.474 --> 16:49.609
- SEE? OKAY, THAT'S MY MOM
AND DAD RIGHT THERE.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.578
THEY'RE JUST
A LITTLE ANNOYING.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.446
NOW, IF I DON'T--

16:53.480 --> 16:55.715
IF I DON'T DO THAT
FOR ANOTHER TWO MONTHS--

16:55.748 --> 16:57.084
HEY, THAT'S NOT TOO BAD,

16:57.117 --> 16:59.386
I COULD ALMOST
LIVE WITH THAT.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.721
WE MOVE ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THEM--

17:01.754 --> 17:02.789
HOW DOES THIS FEEL?

17:02.822 --> 17:04.091
BOINK! BOINK! BOINK!
- OH, RAY!

17:04.124 --> 17:06.093
- BOINK! BOINK! BOINK!

17:07.794 --> 17:10.197
YOU SEE?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.631
THEY GET YOU.

17:11.664 --> 17:17.070
- LOOK, FIRST OF ALL,
YOUR PARENTS ARE NOT THIS, OKAY?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.673
SECONDLY,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.143
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE OVER
EVERY DAY.

17:23.176 --> 17:27.647
- OH, YOU POOR,
BLIND, FAT LADY.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.686
THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE FOR US;
THAT'S ALL.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.687
WE HAVE TO KEEP LOOKING.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.722
- I DON'T WANT TO KEEP LOOKING.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.324
- WHY?
WHY?

17:37.357 --> 17:39.659
WE CAN FIND SOMETHING ELSE
JUST LIKE THIS.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.730
- BUT THIS HOUSE
IS RIGHT BY YOUR PARENTS!

17:45.532 --> 17:46.799
- OH, MY GOD.

17:46.833 --> 17:51.271
OH, MY GOD, DO YOU HEAR
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.639
IT'S THE HORMONES.
THAT'S--THAT'S--

17:52.672 --> 17:53.740
TELL ME IT'S THE HORMONES.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.575
YOU GOT TWICE THE HORMONES
GOING NOW.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.776
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.611
- RAY, IN FOUR MONTHS,

17:58.645 --> 18:00.280
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
THREE KIDS, OKAY?

18:00.313 --> 18:01.648
I'M GOING TO NEED
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.683
WHO BETTER TO HELP US
THAN YOUR PARENTS?

18:03.716 --> 18:05.118
- THE DEVIL.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.490
- DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW MUCH WORK IT WAS

18:10.523 --> 18:11.758
WHEN ALLY WAS BORN?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.593
AND, YOU KNOW,
NO OFFENSE,

18:13.626 --> 18:15.428
BUT YOU WERE...

18:15.462 --> 18:17.430
YOU.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.831
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL QUIT SOFTBALL.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.367
- YOU DON'T GET IT, RAY.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.169
YOUR PARENTS
LIVING ACROSS THE STREET

18:22.202 --> 18:24.537
IS THE BIG
SELLING POINT HERE.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.376
LISTEN.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.578
YOU KNOW, I-I KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T SEE IT NOW,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.680
BUT IN TIME,
YOU WILL COME TO REALIZE

18:33.713 --> 18:37.617
WHAT A BLESSING IT IS
TO HAVE YOUR FAMILY SO CLOSE.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.622
COME ON, RAY.

18:42.655 --> 18:44.457
OUR TWO BOYS, HUH?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.659
DON'T WE WANT
TO GIVE THEM EVERYTHING?

18:46.693 --> 18:50.163
LET'S GIVE 'EM GRANDMA
AND GRANDPA, TOO, HUH?

18:52.699 --> 18:54.467
- HMM--
- OH, THANK YOU!

18:54.501 --> 18:57.304
OH, I LOVE YOU, RAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.639
OH, MY GOD!
WE BOUGHT A HOUSE!

18:59.672 --> 19:02.309
[laughs]

19:02.342 --> 19:04.611
HEY, GUESS WHAT.
WE'RE TAKING IT!

19:04.644 --> 19:06.246
- AH, THAT'S GREAT!
THAT'S GREAT!

19:06.279 --> 19:10.383
YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.420
I TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE
I JUST LEARNED ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

19:13.453 --> 19:16.389
THAT PLUMBING
CAN TAKE A PUNCH.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.596
- OH, MY GOD.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.698
WHAT DID I DO?
WHAT DID I DO?

19:25.732 --> 19:29.369
- PRETTY STUPID, HUH?
- OH, I'LL SAY.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.937
YOU KNOW,
THIS WAS ALL YOUR FAULT.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.472
- ME?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.507
- RAY, WHAT DID I KNOW?
I WAS CARRYING TWINS.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.577
I HAD NO BLOOD
IN MY BRAIN.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.647
- HEY, MY SHORTS DRY YET?

19:40.680 --> 19:43.583
- LISTEN, SWEETIE,
THE POT ROAST--

19:43.616 --> 19:45.618
I DID ALL I COULD.

19:45.652 --> 19:48.588
IT DIDN'T MAKE IT.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.590
BUT I BROUGHT YOU SOME ZITI
FOR YOUR COMPANY.

19:50.623 --> 19:51.924
YOU CAN TELL 'EM
THAT YOU MADE IT.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.460
- WHERE DO YOU WANT IT, MA?

19:53.493 --> 19:55.495
- RIGHT IN THERE, SWEETIE,
JUST MOVE THINGS AROUND.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.697
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
- OKAY.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.866
OH, THESE POTATOES
ARE NO GOOD.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.668
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WE LOVE THESE POTATOES.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.570
LOOK AT THIS.
THERE'S A POTATO FOR THE BOY.

20:03.603 --> 20:05.538
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
DON'T GIVE HIM THAT.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.440
I'LL MAKE HIM
SOME GOOD POTATOES.
