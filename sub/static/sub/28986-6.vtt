WEBVTT

00:00.062 --> 00:03.040
My esteemed partner,
Mr Joseph Merceron.

00:03.042 --> 00:05.266
Soon to be your esteemed partner,
gentleman.

00:05.268 --> 00:07.853
He was falsely accused by Hanson
himself because he tried

00:07.855 --> 00:10.238
to stamp out such greed and
brutality!

00:10.240 --> 00:13.158
My reputation within the House has
been utterly ruined.

00:13.160 --> 00:14.718
What exactly would you seek?

00:14.720 --> 00:15.758
Revenge.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.278
Forgery is a hanging offence.

00:17.280 --> 00:19.038
I'll be forced to name these
persons.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.118
I've considered our situation
and believe there's now

00:22.120 --> 00:23.358
only one solution.

00:23.360 --> 00:26.078
Ned was set up and will take down
all who stand by him.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.078
-I will stand by him.
-Stay where you are!
-I warned you what would happen

00:29.080 --> 00:31.038
if you failed to keep him out of
trouble.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.760
Now, if he falls, he takes you with
him.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.118
Friends!

01:18.120 --> 01:21.398
On behalf of Captain Poldark, who
sadly can't be with us

01:21.400 --> 01:24.318
here today, but who has gifted us
this land

01:24.320 --> 01:26.558
for the building of our school,

01:26.560 --> 01:29.398
it'd give me pleasure to lay the
first stone

01:29.400 --> 01:32.598
and to ask a blessing on our
mission

01:32.600 --> 01:35.758
which is to bring knowledge
and learning to all.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.718
Mr Speaker! Mr Speaker!

01:47.720 --> 01:52.838
Can any here give me reason why
a loyal, high-ranking servant

01:52.840 --> 01:56.678
of the Crown is being held, awaiting
trial, without redress

01:56.680 --> 01:58.998
in the most squalid of conditions?

01:59.000 --> 02:02.198
Is this how we reward devotion
to duty?

02:02.200 --> 02:06.638
These accusations are demonstrably
false!

02:06.640 --> 02:09.717
Colonel Despard is a devoted
patriot

02:09.720 --> 02:12.278
who is being grossly misused
by the Crown.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.838
My dearest Demelza, my hopes of a
swift release for Ned

02:21.840 --> 02:23.558
have come to naught.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.318
Indeed, there is no prospect of
release at all.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.238
Still, I will not give up his cause
without a fight.

02:31.240 --> 02:34.798
I've petitioned Pitt, Canning,
Addington!

02:34.800 --> 02:38.518
Does no-one comprehend there's no
grounds for Ned's arrest?

02:38.520 --> 02:41.398
Captain, could it be that I've
overestimated your capabilities?

02:41.400 --> 02:44.918
Essential for a covert role is the
ability to remain

02:44.920 --> 02:47.758
-silent and unseen.
-Is silence appropriate in the face of...?

02:47.760 --> 02:49.720
What is appropriate is detachment!

02:52.400 --> 02:56.318
To be invested in an outcome
or a friend is a threat

02:56.320 --> 02:57.518
to any mission.

02:57.520 --> 02:59.238
A mission I never sought!

02:59.240 --> 03:01.478
Yet you accepted the terms.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.598
And now, when the subject has run
his own head into a noose,

03:04.600 --> 03:06.200
you continue to champion him.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.358
Detach!

03:09.360 --> 03:10.680
For your own sake!

03:12.240 --> 03:13.720
Step away.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.318
Your maiden speech in the House has
not endeared you

03:22.320 --> 03:24.238
to the tender-hearted.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.078
Despite my saying
what everyone knows -

03:26.080 --> 03:28.358
that slavery is the foundation of
our empire.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.918
It's becoming less fashionable to
say so.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.238
But the success of our business
dealings with Merceron and Hanson

03:35.240 --> 03:36.718
rely on it.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.518
Yes, indeed.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.678
The irony is I've no opinion, one
way or the other.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.398
I was merely following instructions.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.158
Ah, good to see you, my Lord.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.960
Your Ladyship...

03:47.160 --> 03:49.080
On the matter of Miss Hanson...

03:50.320 --> 03:53.478
..does the connection
still serve us?

03:53.480 --> 03:56.958
It serves me to know that Ross and
Despard will be brought to heel.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.640
The girl is incidental.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.878
Papa.

04:09.880 --> 04:13.838
You must know that I did not wish
Mr Poldark to ask for my hand.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.398
That's very wise of you.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.680
I told him to wait.

04:18.279 --> 04:20.399
And I hope I can prevail upon you...

04:28.360 --> 04:31.400
In Honduras, do you recollect how
little you saw of me?

04:33.560 --> 04:38.318
I was building, with my bare hands,
the foundations of our fortune.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.718
YOUR fortune.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.558
Do you think that I would consent to
throw that all away

04:43.560 --> 04:46.238
on some disgraced and penniless boy?

04:46.240 --> 04:47.880
He was not disgraced!

04:52.320 --> 04:54.960
You know he was falsely accused.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.200
One day...

04:58.200 --> 05:00.678
..you will thank me...

05:00.680 --> 05:04.240
..for providing you with a mate that
matches your station.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.798
Jeremy? Clowance? Hurry up and
finish your breakfasts!

05:19.800 --> 05:22.118
Make haste! Morwenna will be
expecting you.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.638
Here, take an apple each.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.718
-Can Garrick come?
-No, he may not.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.198
Prudy! Coats!

05:27.200 --> 05:28.558
Jeremy, your books.

05:28.560 --> 05:31.358
-Clowance, you get your shoes on, please. Sit down.
-I'll take 'em.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.438
-No, I'd rather.
-Zacky Martin's here to see.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.838
-What?
-Morning.
-Zacky!

05:35.840 --> 05:38.558
Come in, come in, go through there.

05:38.560 --> 05:40.320
Make haste, my little chibbies!

05:52.600 --> 05:54.480
Must you be in such haste to escape?

05:56.040 --> 05:59.518
Were it up to I,
I would never leave this bed!

05:59.520 --> 06:01.080
Nor I.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.078
Having feared it for so long,

06:04.080 --> 06:05.800
I have much to make up for.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.238
Five minutes?

06:12.240 --> 06:13.680
Ten?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.880
I waited a while, mistress, to be
sure.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.878
But now there be no doubt.

06:21.880 --> 06:24.958
Ore comes up from the mine,
is stored as we've belong to do,

06:24.960 --> 06:27.518
but when it come to be processed,
only half remains.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.840
And the rest?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.678
How long have you known?

06:31.680 --> 06:33.878
Two months ago I first suspicioned.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.558
This past week, I've put men on the
weighing and measuring

06:36.560 --> 06:38.198
and now there be no doubt.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.120
Someone's stealing our ore.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.960
Look...

06:45.560 --> 06:48.438
..must it not be someone with
a knowledge of...

06:48.440 --> 06:50.680
..the workings and the movings of
the mine?

06:52.400 --> 06:53.720
One of our own?

06:54.960 --> 06:56.000
Sadly, yes.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.958
"My help...cometh even from the
Lord...

07:01.960 --> 07:05.360
"who hath made...heaven and Earth."

07:06.760 --> 07:07.800
Excellent.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.598
And thy health hath indeed come from
the Lord.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.318
That he may do greater good for the
school.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.038
Nay, Sam, I believe 'tis your
patience

07:17.040 --> 07:20.038
and kindness that have helped me
so far.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.120
You make learning a pleasure.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.318
Now I must attend to my flock.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.040
'Tis lucky they are, to have
such a preacher!

07:31.160 --> 07:33.280
'Tis a calling,
to be a servant of God.

07:35.320 --> 07:38.080
But do ye not find it some lonely?

07:41.920 --> 07:43.440
Sometimes.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.678
And I, though my own days be full,

07:47.680 --> 07:50.238
do oft' find that I lack someone

07:50.240 --> 07:52.000
to share 'em with.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.360
Shall we read again tomorrow?

08:02.000 --> 08:03.520
Gladly.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.918
Well, friend, am I not living proof
of the adage "a healthy mind

08:43.919 --> 08:45.280
"and a healthy body"?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.400
I think you've looked better!

08:51.080 --> 08:53.480
I'd look worse, were it not for my
wife...

08:55.880 --> 08:58.078
..whose acquaintance with this
palace

08:58.080 --> 08:59.838
has taught her who can be bribed

08:59.840 --> 09:03.678
in order to make my life faintly
less degrading.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.838
Most of the guards think I'm
a witch,

09:05.840 --> 09:08.638
so I can threaten them with spells
as well as coins.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.958
The dulcet tones of happy inmates

09:13.960 --> 09:16.958
helping to advance medical science.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.438
So far, I've been spared the
privilege.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.318
Excuse me while I, er,

09:21.320 --> 09:23.880
hex the guards into ensuring that
continues.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.478
Please do.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.720
Guards?

09:41.520 --> 09:42.680
The nights are long here...

09:44.080 --> 09:46.520
..and afford one ample time for
reflection.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.880
What do you reflect?

09:51.960 --> 09:53.680
How I should have played the game.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.560
Kept my head down and my mouth shut.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.760
One way or another...

10:06.120 --> 10:07.960
..I'll get you out of here, Colonel.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.400
Captain.

10:19.680 --> 10:23.598
Regarding Despard's impending trial,
Lord Ellenborough's the judge,

10:23.600 --> 10:25.718
Sir Spencer Percival the Crown.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.278
It seems the prosecution agree that,
while the due process of law

10:29.280 --> 10:31.398
-must be observed...
-Hm.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.478
Trial by 12 good men.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.318
True justice sometimes requires
a little assistance

10:36.320 --> 10:39.398
and, in this case, the names of 100
potential jurors

10:39.400 --> 10:43.158
have been circulated by the Crown
amongst their trusted associates

10:43.160 --> 10:46.758
in order to ascertain where their
sympathies might lie.

10:46.760 --> 10:50.118
And who has been entrusted with the
selection?

10:50.120 --> 10:51.640
Gentleman.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.600
Mr Merceron.

11:17.360 --> 11:18.760
He will not be swayed.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.478
So, now we have no choice!

11:21.480 --> 11:22.958
None.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.198
But how shall it be managed?

11:25.200 --> 11:27.278
Leave that to me.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.520
I'll send word.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.478
I fear the Crown grows weary of Ned.

11:49.480 --> 11:52.558
And may use this opportunity
to rid itself of him,

11:52.560 --> 11:54.438
once and for all.

11:54.440 --> 11:55.958
But he's no traitor.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.438
By today's reckoning, he is!

11:57.440 --> 12:00.598
Of course, Ross thinks he was simply
in the wrong place at the wrong time

12:00.600 --> 12:02.678
-with the wrong people.
-And you think?

12:02.680 --> 12:04.798
That whoever set him up has been
clever.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.640
Clearing him will be no easy matter.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.558
Well, if the Crown doesn't kill him,
prison will!

12:13.560 --> 12:16.558
Kitty's bribes may be all that saves
him from being tortured.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.238
Is this true?

12:18.240 --> 12:19.438
Oh, yes.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.878
And sanctioned by governors,
I'm sure.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.678
Who can prevent them?

12:23.680 --> 12:25.920
There might be someone who could
advise me.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.318
I've been documenting everything
concerning Ned's predicament.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.638
It appears the governors have turned
a blind eye to his plight.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.920
Whether through negligence or...
or in exchange for bribes...

12:42.480 --> 12:44.638
As magistrate, is it not in your
power to call

12:44.640 --> 12:46.120
the governors to account?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.838
Perhaps you think I'd do better
to petition parliament

12:49.840 --> 12:51.360
to force the governors to act?

12:52.360 --> 12:53.760
I would not advise it.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.278
Let me think on it.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.440
You were right to bring it to my
attention.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.360
May I keep the record?

13:05.400 --> 13:08.360
I think I would prefer to retain it,
sir.

13:10.520 --> 13:12.638
As you wish.

13:12.640 --> 13:13.840
Thank you.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.600
Slow down, Garrick! I can't catch up
with you.

13:37.920 --> 13:40.800
-Jeremy! Jeremy, can you get the stick for Garrick?
-Coming!

13:50.280 --> 13:52.478
You do know if folk see us walking
out together

13:52.480 --> 13:54.478
they'll think we're courting?

13:54.480 --> 13:56.358
I said that to Jake once.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.960
And see how that turned out.

14:00.520 --> 14:04.200
I shall always regret how things
ended twixt my brother and me.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.280
And yet, in the end...

14:10.360 --> 14:11.398
..maybe not.

14:11.400 --> 14:14.280
For it may yet all turn out for the
best.

14:26.560 --> 14:27.680
Oh!

14:28.720 --> 14:30.518
You're a quick learner!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.560
And you're a fine teacher.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.718
If I dared...

14:35.720 --> 14:37.960
..instruct thee on another matter?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.760
Rosina, she'd make a fine wife.

14:45.480 --> 14:47.798
Maybe I need no instructing there?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.840
So, will you ask her?

14:51.240 --> 14:52.440
Maybe.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.320
Preacher Carne?

15:00.560 --> 15:01.960
'Tis well met.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.918
May I ask you, be there any hope for
sinners?

15:07.920 --> 15:09.278
Surely.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.678
Can a body learn to live a good and
purer life?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.838
Anyone can do that.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.760
Could ye maybe teach me how?

15:19.320 --> 15:24.438
But perhaps I am too great a sinner
for thy God to forgive.

15:24.440 --> 15:28.678
The Lord would say there be no such
thing as a body beyond forgiveness.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.480
His mercy be praised.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.238
According to Joseph, the girl is
still consorting

16:05.240 --> 16:07.120
with my brat of a stepson.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.718
And does that distress you?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.118
Not in the least.

16:13.120 --> 16:16.400
The pain will be all the keener when
they come to be parted.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.760
I had it cleaned and mended.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.040
Oho! I hope it still fits.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.480
I think Erskine an excellent man.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.398
He got Hadfield acquitted.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.000
And Hadfield shot the king.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.598
So, tomorrow...

16:48.600 --> 16:50.080
..you'll be home for supper?

16:52.160 --> 16:53.718
Shall we have beef?

16:53.720 --> 16:56.880
Guinea fowl and four bottles of
canary...

16:58.040 --> 16:59.880
..followed by a gavotte!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.438
A small, private ceremony.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.318
I've scarce been widowed two years.

17:05.319 --> 17:07.518
A grand affair would be vulgar and
ostentatious.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.880
As you wish.

17:10.760 --> 17:13.599
I will leave you to communicate
arrangements to the happy bride.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.839
Cecily!

17:29.600 --> 17:32.000
Prepare yourself. It will be the day
after tomorrow.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.160
-Captain Poldark.
-How are we feeling?

17:49.800 --> 17:51.200
Get up.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.920
Turn around. Arms behind your back.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.878
A useful part of a gentleman's
education,

18:12.880 --> 18:14.798
to see a traitor condemned.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.680
Especially such a tiresome one.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.040
All rise.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.838
Gentlemen of the jury, we see before
us today one

18:55.840 --> 19:01.238
of the most heinous traitors this
country has ever known.

19:01.240 --> 19:06.678
Edward Despard was present
at an illegal political meeting.

19:06.680 --> 19:10.318
His fellow conspirators, including
disaffected members

19:10.320 --> 19:16.758
of the armed services, had illegal
oaths in their pockets.

19:16.760 --> 19:21.718
They were plotting nothing less than
the cold-blooded murder

19:21.720 --> 19:23.318
of the king.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.318
No! Shame!

19:25.320 --> 19:26.838
How would they achieve this?

19:26.840 --> 19:31.438
By turning a ceremonial cannon on
His Majesty's carriage

19:31.440 --> 19:35.158
as he passed on his way
to the House of Commons

19:35.160 --> 19:39.718
and the ultimate aim of this act
of terror?

19:39.720 --> 19:43.518
To signal the start of a revolt.

19:43.520 --> 19:46.598
To overthrow the Government
and Crown

19:46.600 --> 19:51.760
and to establish a republic to
emulate that of France.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.838
Outrageous!

19:57.680 --> 19:59.238
He'll be laughed out of court.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.438
-There's not one ounce of proof.
-No doubt.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.920
Order! Order!

20:04.680 --> 20:06.280
Sir.

20:14.360 --> 20:18.280
My love, we must act
immediately or we are lost.

20:19.600 --> 20:22.198
What other explanation could there
be for a gentleman

20:22.200 --> 20:25.118
of the prisoner's standing to be
consorting with

20:25.120 --> 20:27.598
the rags and tatters of society?

20:27.600 --> 20:30.318
Perhaps he did not consider them as
rags and tatters.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.718
Did he have a motive?

20:31.720 --> 20:33.958
This is nonsense! You have to do
something!

20:33.960 --> 20:35.918
How credible is it...

20:35.920 --> 20:39.438
..that a handful of rags and tatters
would seriously believe

20:39.440 --> 20:43.638
they could overthrow the Government
and Crown and single-handedly

20:43.640 --> 20:45.558
establish a republic?

20:45.560 --> 20:49.358
More to the point, is it likely that
an experienced

20:49.360 --> 20:53.760
and highly-decorated army colonel
would share that delusion?

20:55.320 --> 20:59.998
I invite you to consider not how
improbable its success appears

21:00.000 --> 21:04.518
to you but how probable its success
might appear to them.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.998
An English revolt?

21:06.000 --> 21:08.918
Headed by the man who had already
led a revolution

21:08.920 --> 21:13.158
in Honduras by making convicts,
rebels and slaves

21:13.160 --> 21:15.720
the equal of their masters.

21:18.160 --> 21:20.638
I keep thinking how it must be for
Kitty.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.758
And for Ross.

21:22.760 --> 21:24.518
I dearly wish I was there

21:24.520 --> 21:26.838
but, what, with this theft at the
mine...

21:26.840 --> 21:30.118
Well, here's where you're needed,
sister.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.918
Especially with such fainaigin's
afoot.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.440
He needs watching.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.958
I'll go.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.160
You have my forks fettled in time
for supper.

22:07.480 --> 22:10.478
-Can you, sir, please state your name to the court?
-John Stafford.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.878
I never once saw this man in the
Oakley Arms.

22:12.880 --> 22:14.878
I doubt many of these witnesses were
ever there.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.158
-So they perjure themselves?
-For a price, I imagine.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.998
"The King is our enemy."

22:19.000 --> 22:21.238
And how many times did you hear him
say this phrase?

22:21.240 --> 22:22.478
Multiple times.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.520
Multiple times. Thank you very much.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.318
And what were the precise words that
you heard the defendant speak

22:36.320 --> 22:37.798
in the Oakley Arms?

22:37.800 --> 22:40.398
-He said that we should kill the King.
-How do we refute this?

22:40.400 --> 22:41.518
We don't.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.998
-And how many times did you hear him say this?
-Enough of this...

22:44.000 --> 22:45.078
On numerous occasions.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.600
Call me to the stand!

23:04.200 --> 23:05.718
Over there!

23:05.720 --> 23:07.278
Someone's watching us!

23:07.280 --> 23:09.040
Clem! Ruben! Get her!

23:19.720 --> 23:21.358
You will not take the stand.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.678
That's absurd, who better to speak
for myself than I?

23:23.680 --> 23:26.360
Someone who can say of you what you
cannot say yourself.

23:44.520 --> 23:48.198
I served with Colonel Despard in the
American War.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.398
Even though it was a war we lost,

23:50.400 --> 23:52.918
his commitment to his country

23:52.920 --> 23:55.840
and fellow soldiers never wavered.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.360
If you lose this one,
you'll have me to answer to.

24:00.920 --> 24:01.958
Stich him up, Enys.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.200
This war is not over yet.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.718
After the war had ended
and I had returned home,

24:08.720 --> 24:13.920
he continued to the Spanish Main to
fight alongside Horatio Nelson.

24:15.040 --> 24:19.038
As a young officer in Jamaica he
dug ditches,

24:19.040 --> 24:25.080
built fortifications, risked his
life countless times in battle.

24:27.160 --> 24:30.478
In the diseased-riddled swamps of
Honduras,

24:30.480 --> 24:33.520
he learned that survival...

24:34.640 --> 24:40.078
..depended on working WITH the
so-called rags and tatters

24:40.080 --> 24:43.918
of society. Native Indians,
convicts, slaves.

24:43.920 --> 24:50.638
Giving to all, regardless of sex,
colour, class or creed,

24:50.640 --> 24:52.520
the right to have a say.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.678
He asked the question,

24:57.680 --> 25:04.400
"Should nations be ruled by force,
by an elite, or by consent?"

25:05.840 --> 25:07.998
Everything he has ever done

25:08.000 --> 25:10.560
has been in service to the Crown.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.798
To suggest now that he seeks to
murder his sovereign

25:15.800 --> 25:20.318
and overthrow the nation for which
he has laboured unswervingly

25:20.320 --> 25:21.920
is, frankly, risible.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.478
He is a patriot of the highest order

25:27.480 --> 25:29.398
and the Crown should honour him...

25:30.720 --> 25:33.598
..instead of attempting to cover up
its mistreatment of him

25:33.600 --> 25:35.798
by inventing crimes
he did not commit!

26:13.360 --> 26:15.720
We need to get Dwight Enys
on the stand.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.680
I suppose it's worth a try.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.478
And were you recognised?

26:21.480 --> 26:23.598
I don't think so, I was too far
away.

26:23.600 --> 26:26.118
Let's round up a passel of men and
head straight for Jacka's.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.398
Nay, I think we should wait.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.958
We've still no clue what them up to.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.038
Whether it is our ore they're
shipping away.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.318
Well, what else could it be?

26:32.320 --> 26:34.878
I've no wish to confront them
without just cause.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.558
It's better to watch and wait.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.238
And catch them in the act.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.518
Agreed.

26:39.520 --> 26:42.518
So, we give them no sign
we suspect them.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.160
No, especially not that one.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.918
That's if she is involved and,
so far, there's no proof of it.

26:50.920 --> 26:54.998
I served with Colonel Despard as
Army Surgeon

26:55.000 --> 26:57.078
during the American War.

26:57.080 --> 27:00.918
During that campaign, he sustained
a number of serious head injuries.

27:00.920 --> 27:04.398
Subsequent to tropical fevers and
further cerebral wounds,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.558
all sustained in the service
of the Crown,

27:06.560 --> 27:08.798
have taken their toll.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.318
And I believe that permanent

27:10.320 --> 27:12.758
and irreversible brain damage
has occurred.

27:12.760 --> 27:16.598
As in the case of James Hadfield,
the true character of insanity

27:16.600 --> 27:20.798
reveals itself not as wild frenzy
or raving madness

27:20.800 --> 27:22.560
but as delusion.

27:24.480 --> 27:28.558
There is no doubt in my mind that
Colonel Despard is delusional.

27:28.560 --> 27:34.238
His actions, his speech, his view of
himself and his place in the world

27:34.240 --> 27:36.638
clearly indicate that he is not of
sound mind.

27:36.640 --> 27:40.278
I therefore ask the court to release
him and allow him

27:40.280 --> 27:43.238
to receive the humane treatment
appropriate to his condition

27:43.240 --> 27:46.198
which I will personally undertake to
supervise.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.640
All rise.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.198
-Let's hope we're in for a lengthy wait.
-Yes.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.760
The longer they argue, the better
the chance of acquittal.

28:29.320 --> 28:31.760
My dearest Cecily,
we leave tonight.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.840
He has arranged it.

28:39.600 --> 28:40.798
Already?

28:40.800 --> 28:42.638
They took barely ten minutes.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.360
I know. It's a surprise to me.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.478
Excellent.

28:47.480 --> 28:48.520
Why?

28:49.840 --> 28:52.438
It means the jury agreed without
arguing.

28:52.440 --> 28:54.280
What did they agree?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.718
What should they have agreed?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.838
Uncle Ross's friend should go free.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.320
UNCLE Ross?

29:02.680 --> 29:05.040
He's no relation of yours, boy.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.200
All rise.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.798
Have you reach a verdict?

29:40.800 --> 29:42.360
We have, my Lord.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.158
Do you find the defendant guilty or
not guilty?

29:47.160 --> 29:48.638
We find him...

29:48.640 --> 29:50.118
..guilty, my Lord.

29:56.720 --> 29:59.798
My Lord, we do earnestly recommend
the prisoner to mercy,

29:59.800 --> 30:02.918
on account of the high testimonials
to his former good character

30:02.920 --> 30:04.758
and eminent services.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.438
It was not enough.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.680
Does the prisoner wish to make
a final statement?

30:12.440 --> 30:15.198
Innocence is its own statement,
my Lord.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.360
It now remains for me to
pronounce...

30:18.960 --> 30:23.200
..the dreadful sentence of the law,
which is...

30:24.520 --> 30:27.918
..that you be taken to a place of
execution,

30:27.920 --> 30:30.878
there to be hanged by the neck

30:30.880 --> 30:33.798
but not until you are dead.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.038
Then cut down and your bowels
taken out

30:38.040 --> 30:40.758
and cast into the fire before
your face,

30:40.760 --> 30:43.078
your head to be taken off

30:43.080 --> 30:47.398
and your body quartered.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.160
All rise.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.438
I'm amazed.

31:07.440 --> 31:09.998
Such a sentence has never been
pronounced in 50 years.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.718
Can we not appeal?

31:11.720 --> 31:14.680
I regret there's nothing more we can
do for him.

31:38.280 --> 31:40.118
Break him from the jail?

31:40.120 --> 31:42.440
I'll need you to get me into the
prison in the first place.

31:43.720 --> 31:47.838
I am known and always watched
like a hawk, whereas you...

31:47.840 --> 31:50.678
Caroline, help me knock some sense
into him.

31:50.680 --> 31:53.278
Doctor Enys will do whatever is
required.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.238
Caroline, are you mad?

31:55.240 --> 31:57.718
Because Doctor Enys recollects that
he himself has been

31:57.720 --> 31:59.278
the beneficiary of such an escape.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.758
Do you really compare the two?

32:00.760 --> 32:03.758
I was a prisoner of war, captured in
the service of my country.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.998
Kitty, you must pack.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.678
Ross will find you somewhere to hide

32:07.680 --> 32:09.958
until you can get safe passage to
Jamaica.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.758
Very well, I will join you.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.198
To make sure he doesn't break more
heads than he needs to.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.400
You're insane.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.798
Yeah?

32:29.800 --> 32:31.598
Dr Ransome to see the prisoner
Despard.

32:31.600 --> 32:34.118
-Who?
-Man sentenced to hang tomorrow?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.080
Been taken ill and I'm ordered to
attend on him.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.558
Be careful with that bag, fool.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.718
Drop it again and I'll have you
horsewhipped.

32:45.720 --> 32:48.200
Small token for your pains.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.198
A friend of yours sent a message.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.078
Kitty.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.358
You know Kitty?

33:14.360 --> 33:18.120
Asks if you would kindly leave the
door open in exchange for these.

33:27.400 --> 33:30.718
Don't stand there idling.
The guards change at midnight.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.238
Guards?

33:32.240 --> 33:33.958
Kitty's drawn us a map.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.398
It's basic but it gives us an idea.

33:35.400 --> 33:37.718
We've just under ten minutes to
reach the outside before

33:37.720 --> 33:39.998
-a new patrol comes past.
-You're breaking me out?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.318
Did you think this was
a social call?

33:42.320 --> 33:44.358
You are both magnificent.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.918
We are. Dwight, however, will not be
joining us.

33:46.920 --> 33:49.318
-What?
-He'll return to the main gate,

33:49.320 --> 33:51.798
-say he's attended a prisoner and then leave.
-Absolutely not.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.638
This is purely pragmatic.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.198
If one guard has told another guard
there's a physician here,

33:56.200 --> 33:58.158
that physician must be seen
to leave.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.278
It'll give Ned and I more time to
escape.

34:00.280 --> 34:02.158
Very well.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.320
First...

34:17.040 --> 34:18.480
Well, then, you madman.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.760
Best of luck.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.040
Shall we?

34:51.880 --> 34:53.199
Goodnight, Dr Ransome.

34:54.400 --> 34:55.719
Goodnight.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.478
Shall we breakfast together before
the execution?

35:03.480 --> 35:06.238
Er, no, I have another engagement.

35:06.240 --> 35:08.358
Ah, yes, that one.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.958
Hopefully not as bloody.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.760
Do we break the journey?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.320
Only to eat and change horses.

35:26.240 --> 35:29.000
So, we will not lie together till we
reach Gretna Green?

35:31.240 --> 35:34.158
We will not lie together until we
are man and wife.

35:36.720 --> 35:37.920
Lord save us!

35:39.280 --> 35:40.878
Is it highwaymen?

35:40.880 --> 35:42.120
Open the door.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.000
Quick!

36:16.640 --> 36:18.478
According to Kitty's map,

36:18.480 --> 36:20.200
this leads directly to the cellars.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.920
Sewers.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.798
Not my ideal mode of exit but...

36:43.800 --> 36:45.440
..beggars can't be choosers.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.240
This one can.

36:50.600 --> 36:52.478
And he chooses to stay.

36:52.480 --> 36:53.520
What?

36:55.640 --> 36:57.398
The moment I am missed...

36:57.400 --> 36:59.118
..where do you think they'll look?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.838
I've already arranged for a safe
house.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.038
Here in London.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.118
What about Cornwall?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.638
You think they won't come for your
wife? Your children?

37:05.640 --> 37:07.240
They cannot prove it was I.

37:08.920 --> 37:11.158
Who else would be mad enough?

37:11.160 --> 37:12.720
My friend...

37:15.240 --> 37:17.200
..a soldier must know when to
retreat.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.358
No, no, no, Ned! Not this time!

37:20.360 --> 37:22.320
Not when we've come this far!

37:23.720 --> 37:25.080
Have you ever seen me weep?

37:27.880 --> 37:29.118
No.

37:29.120 --> 37:30.998
In court today...

37:31.000 --> 37:32.040
..I did.

37:33.400 --> 37:35.478
Not when I heard the verdict

37:35.480 --> 37:40.120
but when I heard my friend describe
who he thought was me.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.198
But he was describing more than me.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.920
He was describing an ideal...

37:48.440 --> 37:50.440
..and he was describing himself.

37:54.800 --> 37:56.560
You are everything I have sought
to be...

37:57.800 --> 37:59.280
..but better.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.838
A soldier...

38:02.840 --> 38:04.520
..but also a statesman.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.798
You will make the world a stronger,
fairer, wiser place.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.000
So, leave me here...

38:20.440 --> 38:22.480
..and go finish what I could not.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.680
Get up!

38:55.040 --> 38:58.118
God Almighty, can a man not sleep in
peace

38:58.120 --> 39:00.080
on the eve of his execution?

39:14.000 --> 39:15.720
Can you not sleep, Mama?

39:17.480 --> 39:20.078
Too many thoughts keep me awake.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.400
Shall I sing to you?

39:22.400 --> 39:23.918
Would you?

39:23.920 --> 39:29.758
# When the moon is on the sea

39:29.760 --> 39:34.558
# Kosk yn tar, kosk yn tar

39:34.560 --> 39:40.518
# Silver pilchards call to thee

39:40.520 --> 39:44.078
# Kosk yn, kosk yn tar. #

40:05.280 --> 40:07.560
Uncle Cary said I am to
have a new mama.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.120
That's not true.

40:20.680 --> 40:23.440
No-one can replace your mama.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.280
For either of us.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.320
Will it do, do you think?

40:42.080 --> 40:43.718
I think it will.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.960
Come.

41:00.200 --> 41:01.520
Let me look at you.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.798
That first day you arrived at the
bay,

41:14.800 --> 41:16.240
you had a button loose.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.280
I asked you to mend it.

41:22.920 --> 41:27.440
And afterwards you asked me what you
could do for me in return.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.600
And you laughed and said...

41:34.360 --> 41:35.680
"Mend the world."

41:37.040 --> 41:38.880
I fear that's too great a task.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.398
But you DID mend the world.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.200
For so many of us.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.720
And for me especially.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.600
And now I must quit the world...

42:00.040 --> 42:02.640
..wishing I could leave you a better
legacy.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.440
But you have left me the best.

42:20.120 --> 42:21.280
Here.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.360
God.

43:12.040 --> 43:14.718
Sir, your daughter is blameless.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.278
It was my idea and I fully accept...

43:16.280 --> 43:17.558
Not true.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.958
I suggested it and Mr Poldark was
merely the agent of my...

43:19.960 --> 43:21.758
Why do some people fail to
understand

43:21.760 --> 43:23.280
where their best interests lie?

43:32.440 --> 43:34.080
Why is he here?

43:37.040 --> 43:39.480
I thought he might appreciate
the spectacle.

43:41.400 --> 43:42.800
Let us hope so.

43:48.160 --> 43:49.560
Why the despair?

43:50.520 --> 43:52.398
Miss Hanson is not altogether lost
to you.

43:52.400 --> 43:56.120
As wife to me, she will, in effect,
be your stepmother.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.560
Shall we begin?

44:12.480 --> 44:15.918
Did my mother ever tell you why she
married you?

44:15.920 --> 44:19.158
My father died with debts and there
you were,

44:19.160 --> 44:20.920
throwing your guineas at her feet.

44:22.960 --> 44:24.960
But her heart belonged to one man
only.

44:27.080 --> 44:29.158
It wasn't my father.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.480
And it wasn't you.

44:32.480 --> 44:33.918
Brave effort.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.440
Almost worked.

44:37.760 --> 44:39.240
Let us proceed.

44:45.680 --> 44:49.320
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
today...

45:44.240 --> 45:45.960
Would you like a blessing, my son?

45:48.560 --> 45:50.320
No, thank you, Father.

45:55.280 --> 45:59.038
If any of you can show just cause
why they may not

45:59.040 --> 46:03.720
be lawfully married, speak now or
forever hold your peace.

46:09.080 --> 46:11.280
I wish to declare...

46:12.520 --> 46:14.680
..that it's barely a day since...

46:19.040 --> 46:21.358
..I gave myself, body and soul,

46:21.360 --> 46:23.480
to Geoffrey Charles Francis Poldark.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.638
So, if you wed her, you will always
wonder...

46:28.640 --> 46:30.720
..is her first child mine or yours?

47:03.320 --> 47:06.280
You will live to regret this,
my dear.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.160
And so will he.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.680
My lord, may I have your permission
to address the people?

47:52.480 --> 47:56.518
Fellow citizens, I come here,

47:56.520 --> 47:59.798
having served my country faithfully
for 30 years,

47:59.800 --> 48:03.040
to suffer death for a crime I did
not commit.

48:08.320 --> 48:10.720
His Majesty's ministers know I am
innocent.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.838
Yet they choose to destroy a man
because he's been a friend to truth,

48:17.840 --> 48:19.638
liberty and justice.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.040
Shame! Shame!

48:29.160 --> 48:36.598
Nonetheless, I hope that falsehood,
greed and tyranny

48:36.600 --> 48:37.840
will be vanquished...

48:40.560 --> 48:41.840
..and this nation...

48:44.160 --> 48:45.680
..which I have loved...

48:48.680 --> 48:55.478
..will one day be a beacon of
democracy, freedom,

48:55.480 --> 48:59.480
justice and humanity.

49:01.440 --> 49:04.560
Reprieve! Let him go!

49:58.120 --> 49:59.760
Shall we have rain, do you think?

50:25.080 --> 50:27.320
Dear God, could he be pardoned?

50:43.080 --> 50:47.078
The Prime Minister has seen fit

50:47.080 --> 50:50.998
to remit part of the sentence.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.358
To wit...

50:52.360 --> 50:56.518
..the taking out and the burning of
the bowels,

50:56.520 --> 51:00.478
the dividing of the body into four
parts

51:00.480 --> 51:02.120
and the beheading.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.038
The prisoner...

51:07.040 --> 51:08.478
..will hang.

51:42.840 --> 51:45.558
It could be argued you had a narrow
escape.

51:45.560 --> 51:48.878
A more pliable female might better
suit.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.400
There will be no other female.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.400
So, justice has been done.

52:14.760 --> 52:16.118
Has it?

52:16.120 --> 52:17.440
And hell awaits.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.478
I imagine he'll find it
an improvement on this place.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.718
Oh, I trust not.

52:24.720 --> 52:26.758
The governor has his reputation to
consider.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.438
The governor should be strung up.

52:28.440 --> 52:29.480
You think?

52:31.760 --> 52:33.158
Oh, were you not aware?

52:33.160 --> 52:35.080
The governor of this prison...

52:36.280 --> 52:37.560
..is I.

52:48.200 --> 52:51.078
-This will be your world for the next month.
-And then?

52:51.080 --> 52:52.920
We travel to Honduras.

53:26.960 --> 53:30.038
Heaven...and...

53:30.040 --> 53:31.240
..Earth.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.718
I never knowed a quicker learner.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.518
We all know her game.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.598
Sam thinks if there's a soul to be
saved,

53:38.600 --> 53:40.598
then he must save it.

53:40.600 --> 53:42.118
Even if it's wicked.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.398
ESPECIALLY if it's wicked.

53:43.400 --> 53:44.800
And that one is.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.040
I took a long time learning it.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.758
So'll she.

53:53.760 --> 53:56.240
Though 'tis maybe not my place to
say it.

54:15.360 --> 54:17.438
Demelza.

54:17.440 --> 54:18.840
Ross.

54:31.240 --> 54:33.440
You have no idea how glad I am to be
home.

54:40.240 --> 54:41.918
Judas!

54:41.920 --> 54:43.440
I never thought that...

54:44.720 --> 54:46.000
Oh, poor Ned.

54:48.160 --> 54:49.280
Poor Kitty.

54:51.520 --> 54:53.158
And you...

54:53.160 --> 54:56.760
What do it mean for you that your
friend was declared traitor?

54:57.920 --> 54:59.518
Will your good name suffer?

54:59.520 --> 55:01.480
-Do I care?
-Well...

55:02.760 --> 55:04.278
..not now, perhaps, but...

55:04.280 --> 55:07.720
If I never see London again, it'll
be too soon.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.400
Did you weep...

55:23.720 --> 55:25.240
..when he died?

55:27.720 --> 55:29.800
What good would it have done?

55:35.640 --> 55:38.120
You should not stopper up tears,
Ross.

55:40.640 --> 55:42.360
You should weep for him.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.920
For the better part of him.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.320
It is the better part of you.

56:04.040 --> 56:06.560
I'll walk on and lay the table for
supper.

56:54.840 --> 56:55.878
My love?

57:10.840 --> 57:13.520
Compliments of Mr Merceron.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.638
Anything?

57:19.640 --> 57:21.758
It's like he's melted off the face
of the Earth.

57:21.760 --> 57:23.038
Poldark has vanished.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.238
Vanished?

57:24.240 --> 57:25.958
Am I not bound to help the wife of
a friend?

57:25.960 --> 57:27.798
Now the widow of a friend.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.518
Tess be up to some wickedness.

57:29.520 --> 57:30.798
And you know this because...?

57:30.800 --> 57:32.318
My father is, too.

57:32.320 --> 57:34.278
This document must be stopped.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.318
THEY must be stopped.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.478
The Hyde Park incident was not
sufficient.

57:38.480 --> 57:40.078
I must devise a worse deterrent.
