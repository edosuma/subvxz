WEBVTT

01:16.070 --> 01:18.410
[RuPaul] Previously
on RuPaul's Drag Race...

01:18.410 --> 01:20.540
You need to make over
one of the returning queens.

01:20.540 --> 01:24.180
[cheers and applause]

01:26.720 --> 01:29.580
Oh, no.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.520
Why do I feel like I'm about
to put somebody in drag

01:31.520 --> 01:33.260
for the first motherfucking time
in their life?

01:34.620 --> 01:37.290
[RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache

01:37.290 --> 01:39.130
and her sister Soju.

01:39.130 --> 01:42.200
It was more of a theme
instead of sisters.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.670
[RuPaul] Nina West
and Shuga Cain.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.200
[Michelle] This is a drag
family resemblance challenge,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.440
and there was no resemblance.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.410
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes
and Plastique.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.410
You took my breath away
when you guys walked out.

01:53.410 --> 01:55.080
Brooke Lynn Hytes,
you are the winner

01:55.080 --> 01:56.240
of this week's challenge.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.250
[applause]

01:57.250 --> 02:00.020
I've made my decision.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.480
Meh.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.750
Silky Nutmeg Ganache,
shantay, you stay.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.020
Nina West, sashay away.

02:18.330 --> 02:20.000
Whew.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.770
[Brooke Lynn]
I hate that Nina's gone.

02:21.770 --> 02:23.210
She's always been there for me.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.510
It just sucks seeing her go.

02:24.510 --> 02:26.880
[Silky] "I love each of you
so much.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.710
"Be kind. Go West.

02:28.710 --> 02:30.180
Love, Nina."

02:30.180 --> 02:31.850
[Brooke Lynn]
That was a hard one.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.950
Yeah, it gut-punched me,
honestly.

02:33.950 --> 02:36.250
[Brooke Lynn]
She's so loved by everybody.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.790
Go West.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.920
[Silky] I'm kind of shook
that I was in the bottom two.

02:40.920 --> 02:43.030
It was all a set-up.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.030
Miss Shady Brooke Lynn

02:45.030 --> 02:47.560
gave herself the easiest task
of the week,

02:47.560 --> 02:50.630
and she put me with Soju.

02:50.630 --> 02:52.170
She was trying
to get me to go home,

02:52.170 --> 02:55.300
but not today, shady,
not today.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.410
The two girls
that everybody said

02:57.410 --> 02:59.540
they felt like should go home
is still here.

02:59.540 --> 03:01.440
How do y'all feel?

03:01.440 --> 03:03.610
I'm really proud
of what I've put out there.

03:03.610 --> 03:07.920
It's what I represent
in context to this top five.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.190
I didn't expect Nina
to be in the bottom

03:10.190 --> 03:11.720
and to have to lip sync
for her.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.260
Then when we were done
and they called my name,

03:14.260 --> 03:15.420
and it was just like--

03:15.420 --> 03:16.490
Now, girl, I ain't gonna lie.

03:16.490 --> 03:19.030
When Mama Ru had said, meh...

03:19.030 --> 03:20.400
[Brooke Lynn]
I thought y'all both were gone.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.800
I was really underwhelmed
with Silky's lip sync

03:23.800 --> 03:25.370
after all the smack she talked.

03:25.370 --> 03:27.700
But I'm an entertainer
like day in and day out.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.470
That's not my genre of music.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.010
Silk, you done asked Mama Ru

03:32.010 --> 03:35.540
to put you in this bottom
all season long.

03:35.540 --> 03:38.280
Silky spilled the milk
on this lip sync.

03:38.280 --> 03:40.180
She just snatched off her wig
and just threw it.

03:40.180 --> 03:42.220
She just broke the people's
lights at the back.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.690
Heels like this.

03:43.690 --> 03:45.290
A lot of girls' bark
is bigger than their bite.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.020
[Silky] I think for me,

03:47.020 --> 03:48.820
I am truly blessed to be here.

03:48.820 --> 03:52.530
I was reminded
through the Lord up above

03:52.530 --> 03:54.730
that the greatest gift of God
is forgiveness,

03:54.730 --> 03:57.530
and I realized that
I never forgave Yvie.

03:59.230 --> 04:02.140
And like...like
you said something to me,

04:02.140 --> 04:03.710
and like I know
I'm a hard bitch

04:03.710 --> 04:05.670
and sometimes I get
really, really stubborn.

04:05.670 --> 04:08.440
And that's something
I have to work on myself.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.510
And I would like
to get to know Yvie

04:10.510 --> 04:13.150
after this competition,
but after this competition.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.820
[laughs]
After this competition, bitch.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.750
[all laugh]

04:16.750 --> 04:17.920
I love you, Yvie.

04:17.920 --> 04:19.550
[Vanjie]
I'm glad we all made up.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.320
We all cool and cordial.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.360
[Brooke Lynn]
Let's just take a moment.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.760
Top fucking five.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.130
-Ha ha!
-Aah!

04:27.130 --> 04:28.900
There are a lot of amazing
performers in this top five.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.030
We're all very different.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.030
We all want this really badly.

04:32.030 --> 04:33.600
We are all bringing our A game.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.000
We all know what
is at stake here at this point.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.210
Oh, my God!

04:40.210 --> 04:42.140
Wait, is that for real?
Was that actually like that?

04:42.140 --> 04:43.410
Bitch, yes.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.150
-Oh!
-The whole time!

04:46.150 --> 04:47.250
[Brooke Lynn] Aah!

04:49.120 --> 04:50.590

05:01.430 --> 05:04.700

05:07.100 --> 05:09.140

Warning, warning.

05:10.870 --> 05:13.540
Twerk that thing.
Twerk that thing.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.240
[A'Keria] It's a new day.
I am happy that I have made it

05:16.240 --> 05:18.750
through all them tests
and trials.

05:18.750 --> 05:20.750
It is top five, bitch.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.820
I'm still gagging.

05:21.820 --> 05:24.020
Babe, I'm finna ride

05:24.020 --> 05:25.750

05:25.750 --> 05:28.920
I need a win and I'm gonna do
anything I need to do to get it.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.030
We definitely
are a group of fighters.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.460
I know that for a fact.

05:32.460 --> 05:33.460
[alarm]

05:33.460 --> 05:35.000
[RuPaul] Oh, girl.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.600
She done already
done had herses.

05:38.600 --> 05:42.470
My queens,
it's time to prance and sing

05:42.470 --> 05:44.710
as if your life
depended on it,

05:44.710 --> 05:46.910
because believe me, it do.

05:46.910 --> 05:50.910
The only thing standing
between you and the crown

05:50.910 --> 05:54.620
are those bitches
standing right next to you.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.780
[laughs]

05:55.780 --> 05:58.790
Now let the music slay.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.620
[laughter and applause]

06:01.620 --> 06:04.290
Hello, hello, hello.

06:04.290 --> 06:05.890
[cheers]

06:05.890 --> 06:07.630
Yay, it's Michelle.

06:07.630 --> 06:09.860
Girl, she don't look mean when
she ain't behind that panel.

06:09.860 --> 06:13.340
All right,
our top five queens.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.070
[chuckles]

06:15.070 --> 06:16.610
For your final maxi challenge,

06:16.610 --> 06:19.870
you'll be adding your charisma,
uniqueness, nerve and talent

06:19.870 --> 06:24.710
to RuPaul's latest club track,
Queens Everywhere.

06:24.710 --> 06:25.810
[cheers]

06:25.810 --> 06:27.280
I see five queens.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.620
First, you'll need
to write and record

06:29.620 --> 06:31.190
a sickening solo.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.890
Then you'll be challenged with
the most ambitious choreography

06:34.890 --> 06:37.230
of the season.

06:38.530 --> 06:40.200
Here we go.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.330
And the incredibly talented
Todrick Hall

06:42.330 --> 06:44.270
will be here to guide you

06:44.270 --> 06:46.940
every high-heeled step
of the way.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.340
[Vanjie] Yes!

06:48.340 --> 06:51.770
And tomorrow you'll dance
your padded asses off

06:51.770 --> 06:54.340
in the world debut
of Queens Everywhere.

06:54.340 --> 06:58.080
[cheers]

06:58.080 --> 07:00.720
You'll also be
our extra-special guest

07:18.700 --> 07:19.830

07:19.830 --> 07:21.770
See, God is good.
He's good.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.070
Ladies, this is it,

07:23.070 --> 07:26.410
the final test
to see if you make it through

07:26.410 --> 07:29.680
to the grand finale
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.150
So...don't fuck it up.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.280
Bye-ee.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.280
-Bye-ee
-Bye-ee.

07:37.820 --> 07:39.290
Oh, somebody jacked my pen.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.620
Who's the klepto?
I need a pen.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.090
Thank you, baby.

07:42.090 --> 07:45.330
It's time for emcee [imitates
record scratch] A'Keria

07:45.330 --> 07:47.200
to write her lyrics
for our rap

07:47.200 --> 07:50.130
that will be featured
on RuPaul's new song, baby.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.530
It's for our final challenge,

07:51.530 --> 07:53.470
and these stakes
is high as hell.

07:53.470 --> 07:56.470
Oh, I wrote too much.

07:56.470 --> 07:57.670
They say write eight bars.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.270
I done wrote two pages.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.980
They can cut some out
if they need to,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.780
'cause I don't know
what eight bars is.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.110
What's y'all inspiration
for y'all tracks?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.050
I'm just basically
like bragging.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.220
'Cause that's what rap is.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.850
It's the art of like
telling your truth.

08:10.850 --> 08:12.590
But also like
you have to be confident

08:12.590 --> 08:13.860
about your truth.

08:13.860 --> 08:16.260
I feel like I rap
almost on a day to day basis.

08:16.260 --> 08:17.530
You do, girl.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.430
And if I had to rap,
I would be a little bit

08:19.430 --> 08:21.030
like a Little John hype man.

08:21.030 --> 08:23.030
I would be
a little bit of a dirty style.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.830
The people that be rapping
be brrr, dah-dah-dah-dah.

08:24.830 --> 08:25.930
Yeah.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.340
And I'm definitely

08:27.340 --> 08:30.040
gonna be channeling a little bit
of some ballroom in it.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.170
It's the last challenge.

08:31.170 --> 08:33.010
I get to rap and dance,

08:33.010 --> 08:34.910
something I feel confident in.

08:34.910 --> 08:36.410
I'm just excited.

08:36.410 --> 08:38.280
I've never rapped before,

08:38.280 --> 08:40.620
so this is a little bit
of a challenge for me.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.080
I definitely want to like
do a tribute to big girls.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.420
You know, I'm talking about me
and doing what I do.

08:45.420 --> 08:47.160
But I think
that I'm gonna like try to--

08:47.160 --> 08:48.160
What is it that you do?

08:48.160 --> 08:50.830
[all laugh]

08:50.830 --> 08:52.690
Apparently nothing good
as of lately.

08:52.690 --> 08:54.460
[all laugh]

08:54.460 --> 08:57.070
Mine's kind of like
a tribute to Canada.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.030
Talk about queen of the north.

08:59.030 --> 09:00.600
'Cause there's queens
everywhere,

09:00.600 --> 09:02.670
so I just want to
kind of represent my country.

09:02.670 --> 09:03.840
Henny.

09:03.840 --> 09:05.170
Are you going to sing
Oh, Canada?

09:05.170 --> 09:08.280
-No.
-[laughs]

09:08.280 --> 09:11.080
[Yvie] Brooke Lynn
seems legitimately excited

09:11.080 --> 09:13.010
for whatever rap she's writing.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.920
So either she got like
a really strong game face,

09:15.920 --> 09:18.420
or she's delusional.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.560
[laughs]

09:20.560 --> 09:22.660
[Silky] I know Brooke Lynn's
gonna have some shade in it

09:22.660 --> 09:23.990
'cause that bitch is shady.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.830
She set me up
last week, honey.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.100
[Brooke Lynn]
Y'all are so busy talking,

09:28.100 --> 09:30.500
I just save the talking
for when it counts.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.730
[Silky] Ooh. You know what?
I like shade.

09:32.730 --> 09:35.040
Throw all the shade
you can at me.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.470
[Vanjie] With that hair on,
it's very easy right now.

09:37.470 --> 09:40.280
I know I need to do good.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.340
-All righty.
-[Brooke Lynn] Good luck, boo.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.680
I don't need luck.
I'm about to slay this thing.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.380
And not just do good.
Rewind.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.220
I need to slay this challenge.

09:48.220 --> 09:52.090
I'll be back when I hit 'em
with a brrr-ca-ca-ca-ca.

09:54.160 --> 09:56.120
[Vanjie]
What's the Tee, Christine?

09:56.120 --> 09:57.390
What's the Tee?

09:57.390 --> 09:58.660
-Here she is.
-Hi.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.060
-Miss Vanjie, darling.
-Uh-huh.

10:01.060 --> 10:03.160
It's time for me to record
my track with Todrick,

10:03.160 --> 10:04.870
and I'm ready to rap, baby.

[Michelle] You know,
something interesting

11:02.490 --> 11:03.830
that we just learned about you

11:03.830 --> 11:05.530
is that you're raising
your brother's child.

11:05.530 --> 11:07.830
Yes. I'm raising
a two-year-old

11:07.830 --> 11:09.460
ever since he was nine months.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.900
He's my youngest brother's son,
but he's now my adopted son.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.470
-How did that happen?
-Yeah.

11:14.470 --> 11:16.400
[A'Keria] Well, some
legal issues took place,

11:16.400 --> 11:17.840
and it was
one of those situations

11:17.840 --> 11:20.510
where either someone's
going to have to get him,

11:20.510 --> 11:22.010
or he's going to go
to foster care.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.950
And once you're in the system,
baby, it's, you know...

11:24.950 --> 11:26.050
Yeah.

11:26.050 --> 11:29.280
It's so crazy,
because for years,

11:29.280 --> 11:31.150
I felt like since I was gay,

11:31.150 --> 11:36.090
I was a letdown
to my brothers and my family.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.830
I felt like I wasn't man enough

11:38.830 --> 11:41.560
to be the man in the household.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.500
And it's like now I have
legal custody of my nephew.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.070
As long as I'm around,
he'll never feel alone

11:47.070 --> 11:48.370
and he'll never want
for anything.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.770
[RuPaul]
And has he seen A'Keria?

11:49.770 --> 11:52.470
No. You know,
the whole transformation

11:52.470 --> 11:54.210
would be kind of confusing
at this point,

11:54.210 --> 11:56.110
because all he knows is uncle.

11:56.110 --> 11:57.480
Now, there will come a time

11:57.480 --> 11:59.610
where, you know, he will
have to know who A'Keria is.

asked to represent my college,

13:33.940 --> 13:35.310
which I went to
an all-male school.

-Mm-hmm.
-So you've got a BA.

13:52.730 --> 13:56.500
And I have also an MA
in organizational leadership.

Um, no, I ain't even
gonna lie, honey.

of the competition.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.540

I was still in the competition,

Um, when I hit my low places,
I definitely am.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.080

just get in your head

16:02.460 --> 16:04.790

at the end.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.500
And every time
I do hear those voices,

16:09.500 --> 16:11.230

have to wipe them away,

with the reasons I know
that I deserve to be here.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.440
[RuPaul] Last week,
there were some girls

16:18.440 --> 16:21.380
who said that
you should go home.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.640
How did that affect you?

16:22.640 --> 16:25.080
Some of the girls said
that I should go home

16:25.080 --> 16:28.220
based on the judges' critiques,
and so that's a fair point.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.520
And then I feel like
some of the girls

16:29.520 --> 16:32.390
have harbored our clashes
in their head

16:32.390 --> 16:35.620
and the feelings of thinking
that I hate them or something,

16:35.620 --> 16:37.790
despite like
me trying my hardest.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.590

16:39.590 --> 16:42.530
hindered any close friendships
we would have had.

16:42.530 --> 16:43.930
I'm gonna give you some advice.

16:43.930 --> 16:47.070

a little more open

17:58.570 --> 18:00.440
♪ Twirl, whirl,
drop it like it's hot ♪

18:00.440 --> 18:03.510
[Todrick] The emotion
and the swag is all there,

18:03.510 --> 18:05.650
but I don't fully understand
what words you're saying.

18:05.650 --> 18:08.420
You know what I mean?
You gotta say "rock."

18:08.420 --> 18:09.920
♪ I'm Big Silky
and I came to rock ♪

18:09.920 --> 18:11.820
♪ My personality
cannot be taught ♪

18:11.820 --> 18:13.550
That was more accurate,
but less fun.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.760
You gotta find a happy medium.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.790
Let's do the do one more time.

18:20.190 --> 18:22.600
Hi, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.400
-Hi.
-Come on over here.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.870
So now
throughout this competition,

18:26.870 --> 18:28.570
you've become very close
with Vanjie.

18:28.570 --> 18:29.800
Mm-hmm.

18:29.800 --> 18:31.910
Had you ever been more
than just friendly

18:31.910 --> 18:33.410
with another queen before?

18:33.410 --> 18:34.710
I have, yeah, a couple times.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.880
Nothing serious.
I've never even had a boyfriend.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.610
-Ever?
-No, never.

18:38.610 --> 18:41.720
Now here you are,
final five.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.380
Are you surprised that
you've gotten this far?

18:43.380 --> 18:44.420
[Brooke Lynn]
Yes and no.

18:44.420 --> 18:45.850
I felt confident coming in.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.460
I felt very confident with
the drag that I brought with me.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.060
But this competition
isn't all about looks.

18:50.060 --> 18:51.360
Yeah.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.430
So I've had moments
where I've felt stupid

18:52.430 --> 18:53.930
and I've fallen on my face.

18:53.930 --> 18:55.200
And I've always been so scared

18:55.200 --> 18:56.530
of looking stupid
or looking dumb.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.030
-Well, we encourage that.
-I know.

18:58.030 --> 19:00.600
And that's something that was
really hard for me to let go of.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.940
I just always wanted
to be perfect.

19:02.940 --> 19:04.870
Yeah, but, you know,
that's just kind of impossible,

19:04.870 --> 19:07.810
and it sort of cuts back
on the creative process.

19:07.810 --> 19:09.140
I think it's
my ballet background,

19:09.140 --> 19:11.150
because ballet is such
a structured art form.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.110
And then I went
from the world of ballet

19:13.110 --> 19:15.320
to the world of pageants,
which is the same,

19:15.320 --> 19:16.950
like, there's a right way
and a wrong way.

19:16.950 --> 19:20.960
There's not really a lot of room
for artistic interprement.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.720
In...

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
...terpretation?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.330
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.990
-I like interprement.
-Yes.

19:26.990 --> 19:28.500
-Artistic interprement.
-[laughs]

19:28.500 --> 19:31.570
Those moments where you do
come out rough around the edges

19:31.570 --> 19:33.200
and you get to see
those crunchy bits

19:33.200 --> 19:37.540
are the times where
we fall in love with you.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.070
So before you go,
will you take a selfie with us?

19:39.070 --> 19:40.470
-Hell, yeah, I will.
-Come on over.

19:40.470 --> 19:41.980
-All right.
-[laughs]

19:41.980 --> 19:43.710
That's the light, bitch.

19:43.710 --> 19:44.950
Come here, let me show you.

19:44.950 --> 19:46.610
See, this is the motherfucker
right here.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.480
See, look at that light.
See that.

19:48.480 --> 19:49.520
Is Brooke Lynn okay in there?

19:49.520 --> 19:50.520
-Yeah, she's fine.
-Okay.

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
We don't care about her anyway.

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
Here, now you do it.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.520
-Ready?
-Okay, you ready?

19:53.520 --> 19:55.820
Okay.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.130
[Todrick]
Why don't we put the music on

19:58.130 --> 19:59.560
and you show me
a little bit of what you got?

19:59.560 --> 20:01.600
♪ Body of a goddess,
face of Aphrodite ♪

20:01.600 --> 20:03.460
♪ She's a new bitch,

20:03.460 --> 20:05.300
♪ Davenport Diamond

20:05.300 --> 20:06.970
♪ She twerked her way
straight to the top ♪

20:06.970 --> 20:09.100
Okay.

20:09.100 --> 20:10.710
You're like writing
all these bad bitch-ass lyrics,

20:10.710 --> 20:12.170
but you're reading 'em

20:12.170 --> 20:15.710
like you're delivering an
Easter speech at church, okay?

20:15.710 --> 20:17.450
As opposed to be like,
yo, bitch, I'm A'Keria.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.280
I am here
to win this shit.

20:19.280 --> 20:20.750
-So let's try that again.
-Okay.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.180
Hit it, Mark.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.950
♪ She's a new bitch,

20:27.190 --> 20:28.590
When she twerked her way
straight to the top,

20:28.590 --> 20:30.060
you need to say it

20:30.060 --> 20:32.060
like she twerked her way
straight to the top.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.800
You want people
listening to this

20:34.800 --> 20:36.400
to want to start twerking
with you.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.030
If you say it the right way,
then I will want to twerk, too.

20:40.970 --> 20:42.440
Girl, I gotta breathe.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.670
-Hi.
-Hey, Miss Vanjie.

20:44.670 --> 20:45.940
[RuPaul] Look at you.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.640
Here you are first eliminated
in Season 10,

20:48.640 --> 20:52.580
and here you are as one of
the top five in Season 11.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.820
Child, a lot of people
do not get second chances,

20:54.820 --> 20:56.850
and it's a blessing.

20:56.850 --> 20:57.950
Before you did drag,
what were you doing?

20:57.950 --> 20:59.850
I was working
at a makeup counter.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.220
This is in Tampa.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.020
-Yeah, Tampa, Florida.
-Are you from Tampa?

21:03.020 --> 21:05.490
I was born in Puerto Rico.
My mom moved us to Orlando.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.860
Why is it you have
a New York accent?

21:07.860 --> 21:09.260
-My mom's from New York.
-Okay.

21:09.260 --> 21:10.560
Yeah, yeah,
she's a Nuyorican.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.770
Okay.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.170
You know, she's cool
with J-Lo allegedly.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.770
-Yes.
-[laughs]

21:14.770 --> 21:16.570
-What's your mom's name?
-Anabelle.

21:16.570 --> 21:18.170
And she's a young mother?

21:18.170 --> 21:19.710
My mom do not tell me--
I don't even know my mom's age.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.140
-She will lie to me.
-She looks like a baby.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.380
The majority of my drag
is inspired by my mom.

21:23.380 --> 21:26.480
My personality, my looks,
everything.

21:26.480 --> 21:28.120
Me and her is like yin and yang,

21:28.120 --> 21:32.490
and she thinks Vanessa Vanjie
Mateo is a replica of her.

21:32.490 --> 21:33.990
We are like BFFs.

21:33.990 --> 21:36.590
Now, we asked Brooke Lynn
about your relationship.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.690
Tell me how that came about.

21:38.690 --> 21:40.690
We were just like hanging out
and kiki-ing

21:40.690 --> 21:42.030
and one thing led to another.

21:42.030 --> 21:44.060
So a kiki lead to a kai kai?

21:44.060 --> 21:45.870
All those Ks, yeah.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.100
[Michelle]
And will it continue?

21:47.100 --> 21:48.640
I'm open to it.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.540
I don't know
what's going to happen.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.780
I hope he says the same shit
or I'll have to whoop his ass.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.140
So how has Drag Race
changed you?

21:57.140 --> 21:59.550
Like, at the beginning,
I was fresh off the nipple.

21:59.550 --> 22:01.320
I was still on Gerber baby,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.720
and now I've just become
such a stronger person.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.720
Well-roundedly
and all that jazz.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.760
Uh-huh.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.460
-And I stand before you...
-Uh-huh.

22:10.460 --> 22:12.160
[Vanjie] Looking at
the tic-tacs, looking at Mama,

22:12.160 --> 22:13.730
looking at Michelle,

22:13.730 --> 22:17.100
and I feel like, bitch,
I did something.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.700
[laughs]

22:18.700 --> 22:19.800
I don't know where
I'm going with it,

22:19.800 --> 22:21.300
but I'm trying
to make a good metaphor.

22:21.300 --> 22:23.200
It's not coming to me.
My haiku ain't hitting me right.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.710
And I keep on talking,
thinking it's gonna come,

22:25.710 --> 22:26.940
and it's not coming.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.380
I just want to make you guys
proud and my mom.

22:29.380 --> 22:30.740
You know, I want
to make the world proud.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.710
Yeah, and you have.

22:32.710 --> 22:35.480
They're not completely satisfied
with the appetizer I gave them.

22:35.480 --> 22:36.850
They want the entrée now.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.820
It's a lot of pressure.
I need to deliver.

22:38.820 --> 22:42.160
It's now... or never.

22:43.590 --> 22:45.060
Hi.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.060
Well, well, damn well.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.470
Hello. I see little old
Todrick standing there,

22:51.470 --> 22:52.970
smiling ear to ear,

22:52.970 --> 22:54.600
getting ready to teach us
this choreography,

22:54.600 --> 22:57.710
and I completely feel
in my element and I'm excited.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.710
How y'all doing?

22:58.710 --> 22:59.710
Killer!

22:59.710 --> 23:01.510
Scared.

23:01.510 --> 23:02.710
[laughs]

23:02.710 --> 23:04.480
All right, before we start,
this is Jenny T.

23:04.480 --> 23:05.510
Hi.

23:05.510 --> 23:06.980
-Hi, Jenny.
-Hi.

23:06.980 --> 23:08.320
Are you ready to dance?

23:08.320 --> 23:09.620
-Yes.
-Yes.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.320
With this challenge,
I just want them

23:11.320 --> 23:13.290
to be able to exude
their personalities

23:13.290 --> 23:14.590
while also making sure

23:14.590 --> 23:17.730
they deliver a very clean,
precise performance.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.260
Let's start learning
the choreography.

23:19.260 --> 23:22.930
One, two, three, four,

23:22.930 --> 23:27.840
and five, six, seven and eight.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.640
Let me see you guys
do it really quick.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.370
Five, six, seven, eight.

23:32.370 --> 23:35.780
Queens, bom, every da-da.

23:35.780 --> 23:39.650
Walk right, left and down,
up, down, up.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.020
You gotta drop that shit
all the way to the floor.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.220
Right now it just looks like
you're sitting on a toilet

23:45.220 --> 23:46.750
as opposed to being like
aow.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.160
Yeah, because
I keep getting mixed up.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.760
I get mixed up on the--
I'm still working with this.

23:50.760 --> 23:54.560
I'm sure at this point everybody
knows A'Keria is not a dancer.

23:54.560 --> 23:57.100
I'm gonna have to rent some legs
from somewhere,

23:57.100 --> 23:59.070
because I don't know how
the hell this is gonna go.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.870
We're gonna do each one
of these one by one.

24:01.870 --> 24:03.200
Let's go, Miss Vanjie.

24:03.200 --> 24:04.810
Let's get in formation.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.770
Let's hit it.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.440
Okay, pause, pause,
pause, pause, pause.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.010
Your face,
you've got to sell it.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.610
Like, when Beyoncé
is walking forward,

24:13.610 --> 24:15.480
she always looks
like she's charging

24:15.480 --> 24:16.920
with like a million people,

24:16.920 --> 24:18.290
even if it's just her
and two other girls.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.390
Stop looking at the floor.

24:19.390 --> 24:21.420
Look up
to the sold-out audiences.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.990
People paid money
for these tickets up there.

24:23.990 --> 24:26.490
They got the Groupon tickets,
but they still here.

24:26.490 --> 24:28.230
Right.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.330
Here we go, one more time.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.230
Five, six, seven,
where your fans at?

24:32.970 --> 24:34.940
Give some love to the people
in the cheap seats.

24:34.940 --> 24:36.400
Ba.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.400
Yeah.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.210
Whoo.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.540
[Todrick] That was better.

24:40.540 --> 24:42.080
As long as you keep
your face committed,

24:42.080 --> 24:43.540
it just makes
a huge difference.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.680
I think you got it.

24:44.680 --> 24:45.750
We gotta move on,
but that was awesome.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.150
Good job, baby.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.250
Yes.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.850
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.320
All right, playback.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.350
Five, six, seven, eight.
Queens.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.290
Ahh.

25:00.790 --> 25:02.530
Awesome.

25:02.530 --> 25:06.400
It was...
Yeah, it feels very, very--

25:06.400 --> 25:08.040
This is hip hop.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.410
[Todrick]
I love when you do this.

25:11.410 --> 25:12.910
It's like
you're at the royal wedding.

25:12.910 --> 25:14.540
She's like, "Darling, I'm here."

25:14.540 --> 25:17.640
"Darling, I'm doing hip hop."

25:17.640 --> 25:21.520
This choreography is bam, bam,
ba, ga, ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.490
I am giving you Julia Stiles
in Save the Last Dance.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.350
Doing that move.

25:26.350 --> 25:28.220
I'm here for it.
Work on it.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.160
Ah, I'm gonna die.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.860
-Can you say I?
-I...

25:31.860 --> 25:33.390
-Brooke Lynn Hytes...
-Brooke Lynn Hytes...

25:33.390 --> 25:35.200
-Do solemnly swear...
-Do solemnly swear..

25:35.200 --> 25:36.660
To put some damn stank on it.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.900
To put some damn stank on it.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.130
We gotta get it popping.

25:39.130 --> 25:40.500
We gotta get
these juices flowing.

25:40.500 --> 25:44.000
Right now, she is a very
prim and proper ballerina,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.140
and we need her to go to
the Cardi B School for Girls.

25:47.140 --> 25:49.140
Next victim up on the stage.

25:49.140 --> 25:50.480
Five, six, seven.

25:56.750 --> 25:58.150
Can we stop playback?

25:58.150 --> 26:02.260
Just make sure when you're
doing this, boomp, boomp,

26:02.260 --> 26:03.760
that it doesn't get spastic,

26:03.760 --> 26:06.560
because it starts to look
a little octopussy.

26:06.560 --> 26:07.760
Like you have
a bunch of tentacles going.

26:07.760 --> 26:08.760
You just have two arms.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.930
Boomp, bomp, bomp. Cool?

26:10.930 --> 26:14.300
I know I look like one of those
inflatable car salesmen,

26:14.300 --> 26:16.600
so I guess that's kind of bad.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.340
[laughs]

26:19.340 --> 26:20.840
Big Silky.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.740
And I'm ready.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.850
[both laugh]

26:24.850 --> 26:26.580
I love it.

26:26.580 --> 26:27.580
All right, you ready to do it?

26:27.580 --> 26:28.680
Come on,
let's do this shit.

26:28.680 --> 26:29.680
[Todrick]
Let's hit the playback.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.690
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.650
Queens.

26:33.650 --> 26:35.460
Six, seven and eight.

26:35.460 --> 26:37.120
Queens and left. Pop.

26:38.290 --> 26:40.030
-Mm-mm!
-[laughs]

26:43.230 --> 26:45.230
[Todrick]
Oh, Silky didn't come to play.

26:45.230 --> 26:47.530
Silky didn't come to play.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.770
The big bitch is back.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.310
Ooh, my weave.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.910
[Todrick] Now that I know
you got the confidence,

26:53.910 --> 26:55.040
whenever you do this part,

26:55.040 --> 26:56.680
it's gotta be boomp, boomp, da,

26:56.680 --> 26:58.910
like really precise and clean.

26:58.910 --> 27:00.810
Just think of a Rockette
when you do that part

27:00.810 --> 27:01.950
so it will be clean.

27:01.950 --> 27:03.520
Yeah.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.720
Yes, like that.

27:04.720 --> 27:05.720
-Okay, thank you.
-Great job, Silky.

27:05.720 --> 27:06.720
Next person.

27:06.720 --> 27:09.060
A'Keria.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.420
You got this, sis.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.960
[Todrick]
Are you ready?

27:11.960 --> 27:13.260
I'm gonna get there.

27:13.260 --> 27:14.390
[Todrick]
Okay. Let's do it.

27:14.390 --> 27:18.330
And five, six, seven
and crown. Boom.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.000
And five, six, seven and eight.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.900
Queen, three, four and five.

27:21.900 --> 27:24.100
Six, seven and queen.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.840
Okay. Can we stop playback?

27:26.840 --> 27:30.110
This is a couple of things
that you just gotta think about,

27:30.110 --> 27:31.810
because you're just
like hesitating.

27:31.810 --> 27:33.150
[A'Keria] I just have a hard
time picking up choreography.

27:33.150 --> 27:34.650
I know, but I'm just
letting you know,

27:34.650 --> 27:37.450
if you know in your head
that it takes you more time,

27:37.450 --> 27:39.420
you need to go more full-out
than all these other four girls

27:39.420 --> 27:40.920
every single time.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.220
Because if you kinda like
wait until you get it,

27:43.220 --> 27:44.420
you're not gonna
be able to do it,

27:44.420 --> 27:45.860
and that's just
point blank period.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.660
Even if it's wrong,
just try to hit something.

27:47.660 --> 27:48.860
Okay.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.470
Listen,
you see a girl trying.

27:51.470 --> 27:54.100
Don't keep calling me out
on these people's camera.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.470
I want confidence.

27:55.470 --> 27:57.640
I want you to commit,
even if every step is wrong.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.110
I don't want you to apologize.
I don't want any excuses.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.540
Let's do it again,
Miss Ass Almighty.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.010
Six, seven, eight.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.260
[Todrick]
A'Keria's in her head.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.520
It's like she's never stepped
into a dance rehearsal before

28:17.520 --> 28:19.090
in her life.

28:19.090 --> 28:21.130
["sobs"]

28:21.130 --> 28:22.560
I think that
you're actually a star,

28:22.560 --> 28:25.100
but you don't give me the energy

28:25.100 --> 28:26.630
that you actually believe
that you're a star,

28:26.630 --> 28:28.240
and I just want to see that.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.840
Now, I know y'all didn't think

28:31.840 --> 28:33.770
that we were just gonna let you
dance on this stage

28:33.770 --> 28:35.680
and that'd be all
you were going to be doing.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.010
Oh.

28:37.010 --> 28:38.580
This is only the beginning.

28:38.580 --> 28:39.750
Walk this way.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.590
No, really, walk this way.

28:46.590 --> 28:48.120
Oh.

28:49.720 --> 28:53.260
Yes, honey.

28:53.260 --> 28:55.200
[cheers]

28:55.200 --> 28:57.560
Y'all gonna get a music video
in this bitch.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.670
Ladies, welcome to the set
of your final challenge.

29:01.670 --> 29:04.040
This is going to be our club.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.710
There's a huge dance scene
at the bar

29:05.710 --> 29:07.010
where you'll be performing.

29:07.010 --> 29:09.080
Choreography in and out
in one camera take.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.250
It's one take.
That is all you get.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.820
And if you don't hit
every single mark,

29:15.820 --> 29:16.980
it could be catastrophic.

29:16.980 --> 29:19.120
Okay.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.290
This final performance

29:20.290 --> 29:22.560
will dictate
who goes on to the finale.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.630
I am scared.

29:24.630 --> 29:27.190
Porta Potty shitless scared.

29:27.190 --> 29:28.500
You got your night
cut out for you.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.930
[Yvie] Oh, yeah.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.370
-Yoo-hoo!
-Yeah!

29:34.370 --> 29:35.640
Last day.

29:35.640 --> 29:36.900
[cheers]

29:36.900 --> 29:39.440
-Oh, we got drinks.
-We got cocktails.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.280
Today is the last day
in the workroom.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.480
It's it.
It's the final day of school.

29:44.480 --> 29:48.020
And today's the day we find out
who's moving on to the finale.

29:48.020 --> 29:50.820
And there's fucking drinks
from Micky's here.

29:50.820 --> 29:51.920
[Silky]
Micky's West Hollywood.

29:51.920 --> 29:53.490
Thank you.

29:53.490 --> 29:54.520
[cheers]

29:54.520 --> 29:55.920
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.230
Maybe they can book us
all together.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.830
Oh, my God, it tastes
like West Hollywood.

30:00.830 --> 30:02.730
Mm-hmm. All right, all right,
clink, clink,

30:02.730 --> 30:03.930
I love you, I love you,
I love you,

30:03.930 --> 30:05.600
call me, write in my yearbook,
let's go.

30:07.870 --> 30:11.470
My inner peace rollercoastered
within this competition.

30:11.470 --> 30:13.740
Like, hell, this journey
was not easy for me.

30:13.740 --> 30:15.840
I am truly blessed
at this point.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.380
I just want to say
I know I'm very loud,

30:18.380 --> 30:20.450
I'm very overbearing at times.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.020
No, you?

30:22.020 --> 30:24.620
[Silky] You know, but I just
want to say thank you all.

30:24.620 --> 30:26.520
Like, we've had
like our ups and downs,

30:26.520 --> 30:28.720
but thank you overall
for like accepting who I am.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.960
As a plus girl,
like I literally sometimes

30:30.960 --> 30:33.230
have fights with myself
about things.

30:33.230 --> 30:36.660
And like to make it this far
is so beautiful for me.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.470
And thank y'all for bringing me
out of my shell.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.000
No, we didn't bring
out no shell.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.500
Her shade brought her
out of her shell.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.340
Thank you for bringing out
my inner shade.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.410
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

30:46.410 --> 30:49.840
I want to say thank y'all
so much for accepting me

30:49.840 --> 30:53.980
despite the fact that like
I do get gritty and nitty,

30:53.980 --> 30:56.380
and like cause a lot of shit.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.420
It really does mean a lot to me

30:58.420 --> 31:00.120
that you guys still found
some acceptance for me.

31:00.120 --> 31:02.990
At the end of the day,
these girls are my sisters.

31:02.990 --> 31:04.830
But also at the end of the day,

31:04.830 --> 31:06.490
if I don't make it
to the top four,

31:06.490 --> 31:08.500
I'm burning
this whole place down.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.860
[laughs]

31:10.860 --> 31:14.470
Y'all know my hair's been crazy
this entire season.

31:14.470 --> 31:17.570
And I have put on a special do
for y'all, just for tonight.

31:19.840 --> 31:21.210
Wha?

31:21.210 --> 31:22.640
Oh, yes.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.880
[Vanjie] Thank you.
We're gonna end on a high note.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.950
[A'Keria] Ooh. Girl,
that is some nappy hair.

31:26.950 --> 31:29.850
[laughs]

31:29.850 --> 31:32.020
[Brooke] What's been the most
memorable moment of the season

31:32.020 --> 31:33.220
for you guys?

31:33.220 --> 31:34.490
Like top moment
you'll always remember?

31:34.490 --> 31:36.060
[A'Keria]
My breakthrough moment

31:36.060 --> 31:38.990
was doing the Lady Pudding Pop
challenge with the cops.

31:38.990 --> 31:40.560
Me being Oprah.

31:40.560 --> 31:43.130
For me, it was
the organic challenge.

31:43.130 --> 31:46.830
Everybody over here talking
about who's winning what,

31:46.830 --> 31:48.070
and they think they all rabbits.

31:48.070 --> 31:49.440
But don't step on the turtle,

31:49.440 --> 31:51.240
'cause sometimes the turtle
will outdo the rabbit.

31:51.240 --> 31:52.840
While y'all over there
jackrabbiting

31:52.840 --> 31:54.540
and punching through
the competition

31:54.540 --> 31:55.710
thinking you slaying,

31:55.710 --> 31:57.780
that don't mean you can't fall.

31:57.780 --> 31:59.110
Don't sleep on the turtle.

31:59.110 --> 32:01.720
Sometimes the turtle
can win the race.

32:03.050 --> 32:04.150
-Branjie.
-[laughs]

32:04.150 --> 32:06.690
Is that gonna continue after?

32:06.690 --> 32:07.820
[Brooke Lynn]
Yeah, we're gonna--

32:07.820 --> 32:09.260
We were just
talking about it today.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.120
[Brooke Lynn] We were just
talking about it today.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.660
-Y'all really?
-Yeah.

32:11.660 --> 32:13.460
We're gonna see where it goes,
and see what happens.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.300
You're going to be
like so far apart

32:15.300 --> 32:16.900
and just constantly busy and--

32:16.900 --> 32:19.100
Whatever you--if you want it
to work, it'll work.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.500
If you don't want--
if you don't put effort into it,

32:20.500 --> 32:21.870
it's not gonna work.

32:21.870 --> 32:24.440
My hope for my relationship
with Vanjie after this

32:24.440 --> 32:29.040
is just to get to know each
other like two normal people.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.840
It could be nice.
We'll see what happens.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.350
[A'Keria] Yeah, because,
I mean, I think y'all should.

32:32.350 --> 32:33.480
I really do
enjoy y'all together,

32:33.480 --> 32:35.150
other than, you know,
the smacking.

32:35.150 --> 32:36.150
Yeah.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.320
I knew it was gonna go left.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.790
I can definitely
do without all of that.

32:40.790 --> 32:43.160
Other than that, you know,
for the most part...

32:43.160 --> 32:44.860
I'm so happy y'all approve.

32:55.970 --> 32:58.070

[RuPaul] And what?

33:11.890 --> 33:14.860
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.290
Tonight it's just family.

33:17.290 --> 33:19.760
Michelle Visage. Hey, cyst.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.360
Our drag tots have all grown up.

33:22.360 --> 33:24.530
They grow up so fast.

33:24.530 --> 33:27.200
The hilarious Ross Mathews.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.670
Now tell me the truth.

33:28.670 --> 33:31.500
Did you think you'd make it
this far in the competition?

33:31.500 --> 33:32.870
Oh, yeah, uh-huh.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.040
The trick is to listen
to everything Michelle says,

33:35.040 --> 33:36.280
and then ignore it.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.180
[all laugh]

33:38.180 --> 33:39.310

Style superstar Carson Kressley.

33:44.180 --> 33:45.620
Darling, we've missed you.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.490
I've missed you,
but I've been watching.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.560
I like to watch.

33:49.560 --> 33:50.720
[Michelle] Naughty.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.530
And the restraining order
expired.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.130
[all laugh]

33:54.130 --> 33:55.660
And they took
that ankle bracelet off,

33:55.660 --> 33:56.760
and I raced right over here.

33:56.760 --> 33:58.900

Fiddle dee dee.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.680
Darling, I cannot wait
to see the number.

34:09.680 --> 34:12.480
And I can't wait to see you
fly outta here on a bubble.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.410
[all laugh]

34:14.410 --> 34:16.950
This week,
we challenged our queens

34:16.950 --> 34:20.520
to write, record,
and perform sickening solos

34:20.520 --> 34:23.460

38:08.080 --> 38:10.420
to all of my years
as a ballerina.

38:10.420 --> 38:13.120
It really truly represents
where I've come from

[Silky] I am wearing
a nude illusion gown

38:32.870 --> 38:35.070

38:35.070 --> 38:37.610
I'm showing all of my body,

38:37.610 --> 38:39.750
and I'm embracing
every moment of it.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.880
I have my boobs pushed up,

38:41.880 --> 38:45.420
my waist tucked in,
and my ass pushed out.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.790
[Carson] I know
her middle name is Nutmeg,

38:46.790 --> 38:49.760
but I can see her
cumin and going.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.890
[Michelle] A kiss on the hand
may be quite continental,

38:51.890 --> 38:53.630
but corsets
are a girl's best friend.

What's the green Tee?

38:58.430 --> 39:01.570
[Michelle] Now, I know
for curtain that that's a gown.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.470
[Ross] Well, she saw it in
the window and had to have it.

39:04.470 --> 39:07.510
[Vanjie] So tonight,
I'm giving you Vivien Leigh,

39:10.040 --> 39:12.210
Big-ass green ballgown,

39:12.210 --> 39:16.120
and I'm looking rich
like a good old $100.000.

39:16.120 --> 39:18.420
Cut the check,
'cause I look good.

39:18.420 --> 39:20.220

39:29.830 --> 39:31.630

39:31.630 --> 39:33.070
[Ross] Oh, I see
what you did there.

39:33.070 --> 39:36.070
[RuPaul] Yeah.
My eyes are up here.

39:36.070 --> 39:37.300
[all laugh]

39:37.300 --> 39:38.400
[Yvie] Yvie is an oddball,

39:38.400 --> 39:40.840
so everything is in threes.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.040
Three eyes, three fingers,
three boobs.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.110
I want to show
all of the smashed beauty

39:47.110 --> 39:49.050
that the judges really want,

39:49.050 --> 39:52.920
but also stay authentic
and true to Yvie.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.520
[RuPaul] She's a triple threat.

40:09.570 --> 40:10.800
[A'Keria]
I want to give them

40:10.800 --> 40:13.610
the extravagance
that is A'Keria.

40:13.610 --> 40:18.280
This is a gown that I have put
my heart, soul, and blood into.

40:18.280 --> 40:20.280
Me and my lover actually
created it from scratch.

40:20.280 --> 40:22.220
The detail work
was done by myself.

40:22.220 --> 40:25.490
This is exactly who A'Keria is.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.690
I feel absolutely breathtaking.

40:28.690 --> 40:30.490
Now I just need my crown.

40:30.490 --> 40:31.720
[Michelle] Why chase waterfalls
when you can wear them?

40:31.720 --> 40:33.190
[RuPaul] Yeah.

40:33.190 --> 40:34.460
[Carson] Well, it's
a wonderful fringe benefit.

40:34.460 --> 40:35.830
[Ross] It sure is.
[Todrick] It is.

40:37.230 --> 40:39.070
[RuPaul] Welcome, ladies.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.470
After tonight, only four of you

40:41.470 --> 40:44.940
will be going through
to the grand finale.

40:46.910 --> 40:48.470
It's time
for the judges' critiques,

40:48.470 --> 40:52.050
starting with
A'Keria C. Davenport.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.380
This is beautiful.

40:53.380 --> 40:55.650
It's pageant,
but it's also modern.

40:55.650 --> 40:58.850
And what I love especially
is that detail at the hemline

40:58.850 --> 41:01.790
where the sapphire
turns into amethyst.

41:01.790 --> 41:03.320
I was the most worried about you

41:03.320 --> 41:05.660
for this part
of the competition,

41:05.660 --> 41:07.190
but you really, really
came to life.

41:07.190 --> 41:09.460
You were in it
from the head snaps

41:09.460 --> 41:11.860
to selling everything
that you were saying.

41:11.860 --> 41:16.240
By the way, Miss Ass Almighty,
copyright it.

41:16.240 --> 41:19.840
I loved Diahann Carroll
in Ru's dynasty.

41:19.840 --> 41:21.910
[all laugh]

41:21.910 --> 41:23.980
You did what I love to see,

41:23.980 --> 41:26.880
which is grow
each and every challenge,

41:26.880 --> 41:29.420
and then wind up
as an evolved queen.

41:29.420 --> 41:30.820
Congratulations.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.490
Thank you.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.450
Up next, Brooke Lynn Hytes.

41:34.450 --> 41:36.260
I love your look.
I think it's beautiful.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.690
It reminded me
of Sahara Davenport.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.190
[Carson]
The details are gorgeous,

41:40.190 --> 41:43.560
but I don't know if this is
the best version of your drag.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.830
You know,
from that first episode,

41:44.830 --> 41:46.330
you came out
and you were so edgy

41:46.330 --> 41:48.230
and so editorial.

41:48.230 --> 41:49.370
I was kind of looking for that.

41:49.370 --> 41:52.140
Your performance,
on the other hand,

41:52.140 --> 41:54.970
you hit your kicks,
you hit your splits.

41:54.970 --> 41:58.910
But, Brooke,
something was missing.

41:58.910 --> 42:03.750
There's just a little edge,
a passion missing.

42:03.750 --> 42:05.690
Just fuck it up a little bit.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.520
The lyrics in the performance,

42:07.520 --> 42:09.290
I was kind of waiting
for the punchline.

42:09.290 --> 42:11.290
I wanted the setup
and then I wanted some sass,

42:11.290 --> 42:12.860
and I wasn't getting that.

42:12.860 --> 42:14.690
I wish that you
could somehow find a way

42:14.690 --> 42:16.930
to bring the fun person
that I rehearsed with

42:16.930 --> 42:18.000
into the routine.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.070
I had so much fun
working with you.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.100
You were amazing.

42:20.100 --> 42:23.400
And...I'm sorry.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.670
Thank you.

42:24.670 --> 42:29.580
Up next, Dr. Reverend
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

42:29.580 --> 42:30.980
Silky, you are cinched.

42:30.980 --> 42:33.150
It's a built-in corset
in the gown,

42:33.150 --> 42:35.750
and it took like three people
to zip it up today.

42:35.750 --> 42:39.120
I always felt that internal
organs are really overrated.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.550
[all laugh]

42:40.550 --> 42:42.590
I loved working with you.

42:42.590 --> 42:43.720
You didn't make
a single excuse.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.090
You didn't ask
for any concession.

42:46.090 --> 42:48.690
It was really fun to record
in the studio with you.

42:48.690 --> 42:51.160
You came in,
brought all your energy.

42:51.160 --> 42:52.300
I think you did a great job.

42:52.300 --> 42:54.370
You threw your whole body
into this.

42:54.370 --> 42:56.870
[all laugh]

42:56.870 --> 42:58.700
Technically perfect? No.

42:58.700 --> 43:01.970
But filled with passion
and fun? Yes.

43:01.970 --> 43:06.410
But you flopped back, and we saw
a nude one with a black under.

43:06.410 --> 43:08.350
I just want you to think about

43:08.350 --> 43:11.180
being as pulled together as
you want us to believe you are.

43:11.180 --> 43:12.990
Although I have minor flaws,

43:12.990 --> 43:16.490
hopefully y'all can see that
I just try to be the example

43:16.490 --> 43:18.060
that anything
that you want in life,

43:18.060 --> 43:19.560
with hard work,
that you can get it.

43:19.560 --> 43:21.990
-Thank you, Silky.
-Thank you.

43:21.990 --> 43:26.670
Up next, Miss Vanjie.

43:26.670 --> 43:29.070
I appreciate this look
on the runway.

43:29.070 --> 43:31.700
It's kind of a foil
to what you gave us originally.

43:31.700 --> 43:35.070
You are that tough New York City
girl who will cut another bitch.

43:35.070 --> 43:37.110
This is the other side.

43:37.110 --> 43:40.580
This is a very 1940s
Vivien Leigh kind of glamour.

43:40.580 --> 43:41.810
I was excited to see you
in this music video

43:41.810 --> 43:43.850
because I thought
she's hilarious.

43:43.850 --> 43:45.220
I know you got moves.

43:45.220 --> 43:48.790
But it bummed me out
to see you not kill it.

43:48.790 --> 43:51.590
I'm sitting here trying
to figure out what's going on,

43:51.590 --> 43:53.930
because in rehearsal,
you were the best dancer.

43:53.930 --> 43:56.630
You had that edge, that grit,
that urban flair.

43:56.630 --> 43:59.470
But something happened
whenever it got on stage.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.570
It looked like
you were disconnected.

44:01.570 --> 44:05.440
The biggest problem
was you were barely lip syncing.

44:05.440 --> 44:09.010
You had your moves,
but your words weren't there.

44:09.010 --> 44:12.680
[RuPaul] Up next, Yvie Oddly.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.110
I don't think you've ever
looked more beautiful.

44:15.110 --> 44:18.150
Bitch, you are blended,
and the contouring.

44:18.150 --> 44:19.490
Michelle, do you see this?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.090
With three eyes, yes.

44:21.090 --> 44:22.260
[all laugh]

44:22.260 --> 44:24.890
-And my fourth eye.
-I bet you do.

44:24.890 --> 44:26.560
Drag is like usually
one of two things.

44:26.560 --> 44:28.790
It's either super glamorous
and pageanty,

44:28.790 --> 44:32.030
or it may be a little campy
and fun with a sense of humor.

44:32.030 --> 44:34.770
I love when a queen
combines the two.

44:34.770 --> 44:35.800
That's why it's one
of my favorite looks

44:35.800 --> 44:38.240
on the runway tonight.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.910
Your performance was remarkable.

44:40.910 --> 44:42.210
[Todrick]
I loved your creativity

44:42.210 --> 44:44.210
and your willingness
to try everything

44:44.210 --> 44:46.150
and to go so full out.

44:46.150 --> 44:47.750
You had my favorite lyrics.

44:47.750 --> 44:49.080
Your lyrics inspired us

44:49.080 --> 44:51.750
to make choreography
that went with your lyrics.

44:51.750 --> 44:55.190
You have never once sacrificed
the way you do drag,

44:55.190 --> 44:56.960
and it has hurt you sometimes.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.120
Yeah.

44:58.120 --> 45:00.490
But when it has worked,
it just sings.

45:00.490 --> 45:04.560
I loved how you finished
this phase of this competition.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.470
I think you had
a fantastic week.

45:06.470 --> 45:09.000
Thank you so much.

45:09.000 --> 45:13.970
It's been a real pleasure
watching you girls evolve.

45:13.970 --> 45:16.110
And I'm so proud of each of you.

45:16.110 --> 45:18.340
Final five of this competition.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.550
We know it's--it is not easy,

45:20.550 --> 45:22.420
and it's amazing to see

45:22.420 --> 45:25.820
and I'm...
I'm so proud of each of you.

45:28.890 --> 45:31.520
Ladies, so many
of our younger viewers

45:31.520 --> 45:34.060
watch this show
to find their tribe,

45:34.060 --> 45:36.600
and they look to you ladies
for guidance.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.400
So with that in mind, A'Keria,

45:39.400 --> 45:42.300
what advice
would you give to...

45:42.300 --> 45:45.070
10-year-old Gregory?

45:45.070 --> 45:46.970
Oh.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.580
[A'Keria] I would tell
10-year-old Gregory

45:49.580 --> 45:51.380
although you're scared,

45:51.380 --> 45:53.910
be true to who you are
and love yourself.

45:53.910 --> 45:55.880
It's not gonna be easy.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.350
There's gonna be tests

45:57.350 --> 46:00.190
and so many trials
and so many tribulations.

46:00.190 --> 46:04.690
But continue to fight, because
greatness is destined for you.

46:04.690 --> 46:08.660
You will be the strength
behind so many people

46:08.660 --> 46:12.030
that you didn't even think
would even turn to you.

46:12.030 --> 46:13.330
Continue to love yourself.

46:13.330 --> 46:15.130
Oh, look at that baby.

46:15.130 --> 46:17.740
Looking like New Edition.

46:17.740 --> 46:20.370
Thank you, A'Keria.

46:20.370 --> 46:22.410
Brooke Lynn,
what advice do you have

46:22.410 --> 46:24.480
for little two-year-old Brock?

46:24.480 --> 46:26.980
[Brooke Lynn] Aw.

46:26.980 --> 46:29.080
I would tell two-year-old Brock

46:29.080 --> 46:30.580
there are going to be
a lot of times in his life

46:30.580 --> 46:33.490
where he feels wrong
for being who he is.

46:33.490 --> 46:36.020
There are going to be voices
in his head every day

46:36.020 --> 46:38.120
that he has to fight against,

46:38.120 --> 46:41.130
telling him that
he's not worth anything

46:41.130 --> 46:43.600
and that he's not right.

46:43.600 --> 46:47.070
And I would just tell him
that he is.

46:47.070 --> 46:52.040
He's perfect and wonderful
just the way he is.

46:52.040 --> 46:54.310
And he has so much talent
and ability

46:54.310 --> 46:57.510
that he just needs to believe
in himself and love himself.

46:57.510 --> 47:00.310
And I would also tell him
to stop dying his hair so much

47:00.310 --> 47:02.620
and over-tweezing his eyebrows.

47:02.620 --> 47:05.450
Oh, my God, look at that.

47:05.450 --> 47:06.990
What shade of lipstick is that?

47:06.990 --> 47:08.350
[all laugh]

47:08.350 --> 47:10.790
-Thank you, Brooke Lynn.
-Thank you, Ru.

47:10.790 --> 47:13.790
Silky,
what advice do you have

47:13.790 --> 47:16.560
for six-year-old Reggie?

47:18.630 --> 47:19.830
You knew who you were
in that photo.

47:19.830 --> 47:23.040
Why did you hide
for so many years?

47:23.040 --> 47:27.110
It was so many times you danced,
kicked, and twirled as a kid,

47:27.110 --> 47:28.910
but you hid that you were gay.

47:28.910 --> 47:31.640
And part of that was because
I was a minister of music,

47:31.640 --> 47:33.450
and I just sheltered myself

47:33.450 --> 47:36.080
for protection
from judgment from people

47:36.080 --> 47:39.320
that at this point in my life
don't even matter.

47:39.320 --> 47:40.990
Let the world see your truth

47:40.990 --> 47:44.820
at a very young age and not
many, many, many years later.

47:44.820 --> 47:47.760
Child, live the life
that you want to live.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.430
And it starts
right then and there.

47:49.430 --> 47:51.360
One last question.

47:51.360 --> 47:54.670
Is that a baseball in your hand
or a boiled egg?

47:54.670 --> 47:57.740
That do look like
an Easter Sunday,

47:57.740 --> 48:00.210
so I'd say boiled egg, honey.

48:00.210 --> 48:01.570
[all laugh]

48:01.570 --> 48:03.110
-Thank you, Silky.
-Thank you.

48:03.110 --> 48:07.980
Miss Vanjie, what advice do
you have for six-year-old Jose?

48:07.980 --> 48:09.620
Oh.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.420
Child, you know I couldn't hide
shit back then.

48:12.420 --> 48:13.790
I was so flamboyant,

48:13.790 --> 48:15.290
even though
I was trying to look straight.

48:15.290 --> 48:18.020
I would probably tell him
I know at this point

48:18.020 --> 48:20.160
you're probably feeling
a little misunderstood

48:20.160 --> 48:22.230
and you're just like the
little princess in the house.

48:22.230 --> 48:23.730
Believe it or not,

48:23.730 --> 48:26.770
even though I'm, you know,
kind of rough around the edges,

48:26.770 --> 48:29.170
next to my brothers,
I look real feminine.

48:29.170 --> 48:31.500
But don't worry,
'cause it gets better.

48:31.500 --> 48:33.210
You could always
turn things around.

48:33.210 --> 48:34.970
Always like rely on my mother,

48:34.970 --> 48:37.580
because, you know,
she's gonna be your best friend.

48:37.580 --> 48:39.510
Bitch, take an acting class.

48:39.510 --> 48:41.480
Make sure you can channel all
that craziness into something.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.520
Get prepared, because
you're about to be on--

48:43.520 --> 48:46.790
you're about to do it big,
little Jose.

48:46.790 --> 48:49.620
-Thank you, Vanjie.
-Thank you.

48:49.620 --> 48:50.990
[RuPaul] Yvie, what advice
do you have

48:50.990 --> 48:53.960
for four-year-old little Jovan?

48:53.960 --> 48:56.860
Um, first of all,
smile for the camera.

48:56.860 --> 48:58.930
[laughs]

48:58.930 --> 49:00.900
But I'd tell him

49:00.900 --> 49:05.400
that you don't need to take it
as a personal attack

49:05.400 --> 49:07.670
any time
somebody calls you weird,

49:07.670 --> 49:10.580
'cause that's ultimately

49:10.580 --> 49:12.180
what's going to be
your greatest strength.

49:12.180 --> 49:16.080
I'd tell you not to build walls
at a young age,

49:16.080 --> 49:18.580
'cause it just makes them
harder to break down later.

49:18.580 --> 49:21.520
Keep being yourself.
Keep trying hard.

49:21.520 --> 49:23.720
And also,
green is not your color.

49:23.720 --> 49:25.690
[laughs]

49:25.690 --> 49:27.490
What was this?
This was Halloween?

49:27.490 --> 49:28.790
I dressed up all the time,

49:28.790 --> 49:30.300
so it could have been
any day of the year.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.760
[laughs]

49:31.760 --> 49:34.200
-Thank you, Yvie.
-Thank you.

49:34.200 --> 49:35.470
Here we are.

49:35.470 --> 49:38.740
Against all odds,
against every part of society

49:38.740 --> 49:43.180
who says we cannot do this,
here we are, looking gorgeous.

49:43.180 --> 49:44.980
We are successes.

49:44.980 --> 49:46.750
And there are people
around the word

49:46.750 --> 49:49.380
watching us do our thing

49:49.380 --> 49:51.680
who are inspired
by each of your stories.

49:51.680 --> 49:55.450
So each of you here tonight
are heroes.

49:55.450 --> 49:57.890
You're a hero to so many people

49:57.890 --> 50:00.460
and a hero to those children
in those pictures.

50:00.460 --> 50:04.600
Continue to spread the love

50:04.600 --> 50:07.300
and the courage to be yourself.

50:07.300 --> 50:10.670
It's really important work
you're doing.

50:10.670 --> 50:11.840
Thank you, ladies.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.840
Now, while you untuck backstage,

50:14.840 --> 50:16.610
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:18.380 --> 50:21.110
All right. Now, just between
us squirrel friends,

50:21.110 --> 50:22.310
what do you think?

50:22.310 --> 50:24.720
Give me the lowdown
on my girls.

50:24.720 --> 50:26.250
A'Keria.

50:26.250 --> 50:29.360
Listen, she was feeling
her flavor and her fantasy.

50:29.360 --> 50:30.660
You know,
sometimes I'm on Tinder,

50:30.660 --> 50:32.060
and I'm swiping right on people.

50:32.060 --> 50:34.190
And they show up
and they look nothing like

50:34.190 --> 50:35.590
what they said
that they looked like.

50:35.590 --> 50:38.560
But I feel like with A'Keria,
I swiped right on her

50:38.560 --> 50:40.670
and I got more
than what I bargained for.

50:40.670 --> 50:42.030
And you're on Tinder?

50:42.030 --> 50:43.400
-[laughs]
-Absolutely.

50:43.400 --> 50:44.870
-Wowza.
-Hold on.

50:44.870 --> 50:46.240
Is this you?

50:46.240 --> 50:48.440
It shows that you're inside me.

50:48.440 --> 50:49.680
[all laugh]

50:49.680 --> 50:51.310
Negative eight inches away.

50:51.310 --> 50:53.880
[all laugh]

50:53.880 --> 50:55.410
Interesting.

50:55.410 --> 50:56.980
She was fighting for this spot.

50:56.980 --> 51:00.720
She knew it was crunch time,
and she showed up.

51:00.720 --> 51:03.090
But she didn't make
a great first impression.

51:03.090 --> 51:05.860
She came to the party very late.

51:05.860 --> 51:08.530
-Brooke Lynn Hytes.
-In the performance,

51:08.530 --> 51:11.330
she knew every move
that she was supposed to do,

51:11.330 --> 51:14.070
and did it with zero passion.

51:14.070 --> 51:18.000
She has consistently been
a really wonderful performer.

51:18.000 --> 51:20.610
This challenge called for her
to step it up.

51:20.610 --> 51:23.040
Now, the rap, it could
have been really funny,

51:23.040 --> 51:24.880
but it didn't land.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.580
Tonight what we needed

51:26.580 --> 51:28.950
was her to scream
from the rooftops

51:28.950 --> 51:31.520
she deserved
to be in the top four,

51:31.520 --> 51:35.190
and what she did was politely
ask to be in the top four.

51:35.190 --> 51:37.760
[RuPaul] Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

51:37.760 --> 51:40.290
I love me
some Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

51:40.290 --> 51:42.230
[Michelle]
There's nothing Silky can do

51:42.230 --> 51:44.660
that I won't want
a ticket to watch.

51:44.660 --> 51:47.070
Even busting out of a bathroom
and knocking people out.

51:47.070 --> 51:50.000
It was a little sloppy,
but it was funny.

51:50.000 --> 51:52.940
There's a magic to Silky
that you can't deny.

51:52.940 --> 51:54.870
I understand it's not perfect,

51:54.870 --> 51:56.140
but where
there have been valleys,

51:56.140 --> 51:57.640
there have been big peaks
for Silky.

51:57.640 --> 51:59.880
If I need to think about
who I want to see in the finale,

51:59.880 --> 52:02.110
I'd like to see
what Silky can do.

52:02.110 --> 52:03.880
[RuPaul] Miss Vanjie.

52:03.880 --> 52:07.550
Her performance was really
disjointed, you guys.

52:07.550 --> 52:09.460
Her rap was fantastic.

52:09.460 --> 52:13.830
The performance of it when
we said action did not connect.

52:13.830 --> 52:15.130
She missed the ball.

52:15.130 --> 52:16.560
She didn't really quite deliver.

52:16.560 --> 52:19.030
But does that mean
she can't always deliver?

52:19.030 --> 52:22.070
Does that mean she gets another
chance to go to the next round?

52:22.070 --> 52:23.740
I would love
to see that happen for her.

52:23.740 --> 52:27.270
She's gotten chance
after chance after chance.

52:27.270 --> 52:29.480
Well, bitch, I want
one more chance, okay?

52:29.480 --> 52:31.510
I don't know if you can
look past it tonight.

52:31.510 --> 52:33.650
Listen, nobody would want
to see Vanjie in the finale

52:33.650 --> 52:34.910
more than me.

52:34.910 --> 52:36.980
Don't you want to live
in that kind of world?

52:36.980 --> 52:38.950
What if we lived in a world

52:38.950 --> 52:41.290
where Miss Vanjie
could win this whole thing?

52:41.290 --> 52:42.350
[RuPaul] Yvie Oddly.

52:42.350 --> 52:43.890
She, throughout
this competition,

52:43.890 --> 52:45.520
has been a pretty strong hitter.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.860
And tonight in the performance,

52:46.860 --> 52:48.560
I have to say, you guys,
I think she was my favorite.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.930
[Todrick]
Her ability to describe

52:49.930 --> 52:52.230
who she was musically
was amazing.

52:52.230 --> 52:55.930
This is such a big moment
for Yvie.

52:55.930 --> 52:57.570
She's taken the pressure
of this competition,

52:57.570 --> 52:58.640
which could crush people.

52:58.640 --> 53:00.570
-Yes.
-But instead, the pressure

53:00.570 --> 53:03.380
has turned her into
a diamond version of herself.

53:03.380 --> 53:05.680
A lot of these kids
are regional and they're raw,

53:05.680 --> 53:07.280
but they've got something.

53:07.280 --> 53:09.620
You know,
learning how to shape it

53:09.620 --> 53:12.650
and make it work in this context
is what it's all about,

53:12.650 --> 53:14.690
and she's definitely done it.

53:14.690 --> 53:16.560
Like friggin' a power hitter.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.460
All right. Silence.

53:19.460 --> 53:21.090
I've made my decision.

53:21.090 --> 53:23.830
Bring back my girls.

53:23.830 --> 53:25.030
Welcome back, ladies.

53:25.030 --> 53:28.600
You've all fought ferociously

53:28.600 --> 53:30.470
for your spot
on this stage tonight,

53:30.470 --> 53:32.400
but only four of you

53:32.400 --> 53:34.540
will make it through
to the grand finale.

53:34.540 --> 53:37.440
I've made some decisions.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.320
Yvie Oddly.

53:49.620 --> 53:50.920
Con-drag-ulations.

53:50.920 --> 53:54.260
You're moving on
to the grand finale.

53:54.260 --> 53:57.960
[applause]

53:57.960 --> 53:59.670
You may step
to the back of the stage.

53:59.670 --> 54:01.100
Thank you so much.

54:06.210 --> 54:08.840
A'Keria C. Davenport.

54:10.280 --> 54:11.610
Con-drag-ulations.

54:11.610 --> 54:13.850
You, too, are moving on
to the finale.

54:13.850 --> 54:16.880
[applause]

54:16.880 --> 54:18.220
Thank you so much.

54:19.890 --> 54:20.820
Love you.

54:27.030 --> 54:28.430
Miss Vanjie.

54:30.860 --> 54:34.870
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

54:36.170 --> 54:37.840
I feel like my heart

54:37.840 --> 54:39.810
has been like ripped
out of my chest.

54:39.810 --> 54:44.310
I've been trying so hard,
and I'm just...

54:44.310 --> 54:47.650
like, I'm...

54:50.980 --> 54:52.220
Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

54:55.390 --> 54:58.290
Con-drag-ulations.

54:58.290 --> 55:00.860
You're moving on
to the grand finale.

55:00.860 --> 55:02.930
[applause]

55:02.930 --> 55:04.700
Thank you.

55:06.170 --> 55:08.500
And not only
do I have to lip sync,

55:08.500 --> 55:10.300
now I have to lip sync
against Brooke Lynn.

55:10.300 --> 55:13.940
I would have felt better
against anybody but him.

55:13.940 --> 55:14.970
Anybody.

55:14.970 --> 55:16.380
[RuPaul] Brooke Lynn Hytes,

55:16.380 --> 55:19.850
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

55:19.850 --> 55:22.080
I don't think
I deserve to be in the bottom.

55:22.080 --> 55:24.620
Obviously I did something
to put myself here

55:24.620 --> 55:26.550
that the judges can see
that I cannot see.

55:26.550 --> 55:30.820
So I'm just gonna perform
the shit out of the song.

55:30.820 --> 55:33.930
Two queens stand before me.

55:33.930 --> 55:35.590
I've consulted with the judges,

55:35.590 --> 55:38.960
but the final decision
is mine to make.

55:38.960 --> 55:42.100
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

55:42.100 --> 55:45.000
and save yourself
from elimination.

55:46.770 --> 55:48.770
The time has come...
[thunder]

55:48.770 --> 55:51.580
for you to lip sync...

55:51.580 --> 55:54.580
[echoing] for your life!

55:57.020 --> 55:58.580
Obviously me and Brooke Lynn
are really close,

55:58.580 --> 56:01.650
but I don't care who's
on the other side of the stage.

56:01.650 --> 56:04.190
There's nothing I want more
than to be here.

56:04.190 --> 56:07.760
[Brooke] It is hard lip syncing
against someone I care about.

56:07.760 --> 56:09.530
Like one of us
is going home after this,

56:09.530 --> 56:11.030
and that sucks.

56:11.030 --> 56:12.870
But we're both going
to give this our best shot.

56:12.870 --> 56:15.730
I'm not throwing
anything away for anybody.

56:15.730 --> 56:19.940
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

is proud of what I've done.
