(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:10.404 --> 01:12.406
There we go. Nice and easy.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.507
-Good doggy!
-Hey, hey!

01:13.507 --> 01:15.342
-What are you doing, mate?
-|t's heavy!

01:15.342 --> 01:16.143
Hey...!

01:16.143 --> 01:18.045
Hey, careful, Bert.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.013
This is an expensive artifact.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.884
He wants it up here, right?

01:23.884 --> 01:26.352
BERT:
That's a boy.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.923
Easy now. It won't bite.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.059
Get on. Don't be too sure.

01:32.059 --> 01:33.661
Look at those teeth, eh?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.496
Like a bloody buzz saw.

01:35.496 --> 01:37.731
-(cart rolling)
-Here, let me give you a hand.

01:37.731 --> 01:40.367
Don't! Don't touch it.

01:40.367 --> 01:43.737
I can manage this... last one.

01:43.737 --> 01:44.829
(grunts)

01:47.408 --> 01:49.535
(grunts)

01:52.513 --> 01:54.214
You want us to open these crates
for you, governor?

01:54.214 --> 01:57.017
No, no, no, I can handle that.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.553
Eh, what about this
here coffin?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.822
Coffin?! Who told you that?

02:01.822 --> 02:04.391
I'm sorry, governor.
| just thought that maybe...

02:04.391 --> 02:05.759
Never mind.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.027
Right.

02:07.027 --> 02:09.697
Look, just clear out now,
both of you.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.686
Right.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.601
I know what I'm doing.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.003
It's not a coffin.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.868
Remember, there's not a coffin.

02:30.350 --> 02:31.942
(knocking on door)

02:32.953 --> 02:34.215
(knocking continues)

02:39.293 --> 02:41.061
(knocking continues)

02:41.061 --> 02:43.097
MAN (muffled):
Mr. Hartley?

02:43.097 --> 02:44.631
Arthur Hartley?

02:44.631 --> 02:46.734
Yes? Who is it?

02:46.734 --> 02:49.136
MAN:
I must talk to you.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.904
Listen, l-l'm very sorry.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.806
Uh, it's very late.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.641
Why don't you come back
tomorrow?

02:54.641 --> 02:56.877
MAN:
Tomorrow may be too late.

02:56.877 --> 02:59.402
I must see you... now.

03:01.415 --> 03:02.677
(sighs)

03:04.084 --> 03:06.019
All right, just a minute.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.121
(knocking continues)

03:07.121 --> 03:09.055
Yes, yes.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.725
(knocking continues)

03:11.725 --> 03:13.249
Yes, coming.

03:15.395 --> 03:16.396
May I come in?

03:16.396 --> 03:19.900
Well, it's very... Wait...
Just...

03:19.900 --> 03:21.800
Wait a minute, what do you think
you're doing?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.706
It is best we speak privately.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.442
Why?

03:28.442 --> 03:29.710
Now, who are you?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.577
My name is Hammid Bey.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.519
(chuckles)
Very impressive.

03:38.519 --> 03:42.156
You have a remarkable
collection, Mr. Hartley.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.957
How do you know my name?

03:43.957 --> 03:46.727
Oh, I know a great deal
about you, Mr. Hartley.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.964
You're an American,
an amateur archaeologist...

03:50.964 --> 03:52.800
and...

03:52.800 --> 03:55.302
a thief.

03:55.302 --> 03:57.237
Nowjust a minute!

03:57.237 --> 04:00.307
Every one of these pieces--
stolen,

04:00.307 --> 04:03.477
smuggled out of that sacred tomb

04:03.477 --> 04:05.846
you discovered in the desert
below Giza.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.347
Who sent you?

04:07.347 --> 04:09.683
Nobody sent me.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.675
I came here to warn you.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.422
Don't touch that.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.725
l have no intention of doing so.

04:18.725 --> 04:22.729
This is the seal of Khefra,
the beetle god of ancient Egypt.

04:22.729 --> 04:24.565
Do you know what that means?

04:24.565 --> 04:25.866
No, not yet.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.901
But that's why I'm here,

04:27.901 --> 04:31.171
to do research on my findings
at the British Museum.

04:31.171 --> 04:35.409
These inscriptions,
however, I... I can't read them.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.511
Then allow me.

04:37.511 --> 04:41.081
This case contains the body
of a temple virgin

04:41.081 --> 04:43.617
who violated her vows.

04:43.617 --> 04:48.455
She was put to death and cursed.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.257
And anyone who disturbs
her mummy

04:50.257 --> 04:51.992
will share the same curse.

04:51.992 --> 04:55.095
I came only to claim the case,
and return it back to

04:55.095 --> 04:58.065
its rightful resting place.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.601
Do you think I'm a fool?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.135
Is that what you think?

05:02.135 --> 05:05.672
Look, you know as well as I do
that mummies like this

05:05.672 --> 05:08.008
were buried
with their personal jewelry,

05:08.008 --> 05:10.043
and that's what
you're really after.

05:10.043 --> 05:14.414
Please, Mr. Hartley...

05:14.414 --> 05:17.184
And I'm warning you. Get out.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.119
And stay out!

05:19.119 --> 05:21.555
As you wish.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.817
HARTLEY:
Uh-huh.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.767
I'm staying in the village,
at the inn.

05:33.767 --> 05:38.005
If you change your mind,
you can reach me there.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.404
(firmly):
Out.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.170
Right, yeah.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.046
(sighs)

05:46.046 --> 05:48.139
Now...

06:01.094 --> 06:02.789
(lid creaking)

06:04.898 --> 06:06.066
(gasps softly)

06:06.066 --> 06:07.761
All right.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.620
(gasps)

06:31.491 --> 06:34.187
l was right.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.701
(whispering):
Oh, it's magnificent.

06:40.701 --> 06:44.102
Absolutely magnificent.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.266
Oh...

06:53.347 --> 06:55.549
(chuckles)

06:55.549 --> 06:57.540
Thanks, old girl.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.571
(gasping)

07:31.852 --> 07:34.047
(relieved sigh)

07:36.289 --> 07:37.654
(sighs)

07:42.029 --> 07:43.621
(sighs)

07:45.932 --> 07:47.832
(sighing)

07:49.369 --> 07:51.171
Nightmare.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.537
Just a nightmare.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.077
(birds chirping)

08:09.489 --> 08:10.478
Hmm.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.379
(birds chirping)

08:36.817 --> 08:39.342
(whistling)

08:50.363 --> 08:51.898
(gasps)

08:51.898 --> 08:55.493
(moaning)

08:56.703 --> 08:58.193
(yells)

09:03.477 --> 09:06.105
(birds chirping)

09:11.985 --> 09:14.283
Ah, it's nerves.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.565
(chuckles)

09:25.565 --> 09:27.123
Priceless.

09:36.443 --> 09:37.603
Oh!

09:38.678 --> 09:40.407
Ugh!

09:42.182 --> 09:43.308
(thud)

09:51.057 --> 09:53.924
(hand pump whooshing,
liquid hissing)

09:55.295 --> 09:58.398
(knocking at door)

09:58.398 --> 09:59.866
Go away!

09:59.866 --> 10:01.458
(knocking continues)

10:07.407 --> 10:09.476
I'm sorry to disturb you.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.944
Disturb me?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.747
You're not disturbing me.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.982
What's there
to be disturbed about?

10:15.982 --> 10:16.983
Here, come in.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.076
See for yourself.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.625
| see you chose
to disregard my warning.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
About the mummy?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.763
Yes, I opened it.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.299
What happened then?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.733
Nothing.

10:33.733 --> 10:34.734
Nothing?

10:34.734 --> 10:36.136
Well, what did you think?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.505
The mummy would come to life?

10:38.505 --> 10:41.808
The mummy is dead,
but the curse still alive!

10:41.808 --> 10:44.174
You're talking nonsense.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.717
Yes, I've been doing
some spraying.

10:50.717 --> 10:53.587
The cottage has been vacant
for more than a year.

10:53.587 --> 10:56.181
| just got rid of a few insects.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.260
What sort of insects,
Mr. Hartley?

11:00.260 --> 11:03.129
It doesn't matter.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.531
They're gone now.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.466
But they will return.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.767
Look, how do you know?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.537
The gods of ancient Egypt
have not vanished.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.038
That's superstition.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.232
Is it?

11:14.741 --> 11:18.378
The power of gods is real.

11:18.378 --> 11:22.916
That's why you must
give the mummy back to me.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.907
The mummy...

11:26.353 --> 11:28.218
...and the jewels.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.019
So that's it.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.197
So that's it.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.771
You were after these rubies
all along, weren't you?

11:44.771 --> 11:47.073
Playing your little tricks.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.175
Trying to scare me.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.278
Well, it didn't work.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.114
Please, Mr. Hartley,
you're making a mistake.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.383
No one can defy the gods.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.748
For the sake of your life...

11:59.786 --> 12:04.457
For the sake of yours,
get out and stay out.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.493
This is your last chance.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.723
And this is yours.

12:12.132 --> 12:15.302
Now, go!

12:15.302 --> 12:17.532
If you insist.

12:30.116 --> 12:32.819
Only one last word, Mr. Hartley.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.055
Whatever you do,

12:35.055 --> 12:37.757
if you value your life,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.817
don't touch that mummy again.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.927
(sighs)

12:49.569 --> 12:51.560
(deep sigh)

12:55.942 --> 12:58.978
(chuckles)

12:58.978 --> 13:01.981
The man's an idiot.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.983
Don't touch the mummy, he says.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.474
(scoffs):
Don't touch the mummy.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.920
Don't touch the mummy?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.693
So that's it.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.967
Sure, all right, so the rubies

13:20.967 --> 13:22.902
in the eyes
aren't the only ones.

13:22.902 --> 13:26.065
All right, old girl, let's see
what else you've got hiding.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.773
Damn.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.948
All right, sure,
you old girl...

13:34.948 --> 13:37.075
if that's the way you want it.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.845
(grunts)

13:47.594 --> 13:50.029
(gasping sigh)

13:50.029 --> 13:52.497
l was right.

14:05.145 --> 14:07.347
(gasps)

14:07.347 --> 14:09.338
(laughing)

14:13.186 --> 14:15.688
Look at this stuff.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.424
It's flawless.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.824
(exotic music playing)

14:23.129 --> 14:24.596
More tricks?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.558
We'll see about that.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.905
(music continues)

14:31.905 --> 14:33.973
Look, I know you're out here.

14:33.973 --> 14:36.601
Stop that damn noise
and go away.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.043
All right, I warned you.

14:45.051 --> 14:47.019
(music stops)

15:02.368 --> 15:04.097
Nobody there.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.841
l scared him off.

15:07.841 --> 15:10.143
(chuckles)

15:10.143 --> 15:11.811
Yeah.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.513
(chuckling)

15:13.513 --> 15:15.348
No more tricks.

15:15.348 --> 15:18.418
I'd say that this calls for

15:18.418 --> 15:22.121
a little, what, celebration,
don't you think?

15:22.121 --> 15:24.089
Ithink.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.728
Yeah.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.563
The jewels.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.700
What happened to my jewels?

15:33.700 --> 15:36.362
What happened
to my jewels?!

15:39.672 --> 15:41.572
Where are they?
How could they disappear?

15:48.081 --> 15:49.082
I saw them.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.718
I am not crazy. I saw them.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.052
You saw them. You saw them.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.587
You saw them!

15:54.587 --> 15:56.322
Tell me,
what became of my jewels?

15:56.322 --> 15:57.755
Tell me!

15:59.158 --> 16:01.027
What am I talking to you for?

16:01.027 --> 16:03.018
You're just a bunch
of silly statues.

16:04.364 --> 16:08.067
And I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.770
This is another one
of Hammid Bey's tricks.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.672
How did he do it?

16:12.672 --> 16:14.240
Think, think, think, think.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.176
There's got to be an answer;
there's got to be.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.713
0h, stop talking to yourself.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.578
What you need is a drink.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.583
Well, I'll be damned.

16:37.463 --> 16:40.466
They must have been here
all the time.

16:40.466 --> 16:41.797
They had to be.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.506
Hypnosis-- that's how he did it.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.207
Sure.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.710
(chuckles)

16:50.710 --> 16:52.879
Why, that old devil.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.682
Sure... he hypnotized me.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.884
(chuckles)

16:57.884 --> 17:01.087
Gentlemen... a toast.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.522
Because you're dead,

17:02.522 --> 17:05.389
you're dead and I'm alive!

17:09.762 --> 17:11.297
(sighs)

17:11.297 --> 17:13.166
Hear me, old girl?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.599
I'm alive.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.206
How about it?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.197
Want to drink to that, hmm?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.278
Party pooper.

17:25.278 --> 17:26.575
Who needs you?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.048
(sighs)

17:29.048 --> 17:31.684
Stop staring at me.

17:31.684 --> 17:34.244
Stop staring at me!

17:35.722 --> 17:37.090
There.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.559
You can stay in that case
and rot, for all I care.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.095
And I'm not afraid
of you anymore-- uh-uh.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.230
You or Hammid Bey.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.027
I'm not afraid of anybody.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.937
(lid creaks)

18:32.078 --> 18:35.343
(exotic music playing)

18:43.289 --> 18:45.450
(exotic music continues)

18:54.233 --> 18:56.030
J‘J‘

19:13.920 --> 19:15.649
(whimpers, gasps)

19:20.259 --> 19:21.851
No...

19:23.596 --> 19:25.029
(yelling)

19:26.766 --> 19:29.997
(screaming)

19:32.004 --> 19:33.369
(echoing scream fades)

19:35.475 --> 19:37.477
(birds chirping)

19:37.477 --> 19:38.967
CONSTABLE:
Detective Richards!

19:41.614 --> 19:43.616
-Constable Higsby, sir.
-Right.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.351
Have you spoken
to Mr. Hartley yet?

19:45.351 --> 19:46.352
Uh, not yet, sir.

19:46.352 --> 19:48.121
No, l was waiting for you,
like I said I would.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.655
You said a lot of things,
Constable,

19:49.655 --> 19:51.390
that didn't really add up.

19:51.390 --> 19:56.662
Statues, jewels, curses
involving bloody beetles.

19:56.662 --> 19:58.397
Well, sir, this Hammid Bey...

19:58.397 --> 19:59.799
Oh, yes!

19:59.799 --> 20:02.168
Where is this
mysterious Egyptian?

20:02.168 --> 20:03.836
I'm afraid he... he left the inn

20:03.836 --> 20:06.205
shortly after he rang me
this morning, sir.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.741
Perhaps Mr. Hartley
knows where he is.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.437
What do you say we find out?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.315
-But sir, we...
-I didn't make this trip

20:16.315 --> 20:18.749
to listen
to a lot of tall tales.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.290
Look, sir-- statues.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.958
Just like Hammid Bey said.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.495
Never mind the statues,
Constable.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.656
Mr. Hartley?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.865
Mr. Hartley?

20:41.007 --> 20:43.176
Look, sir, jewels.

20:43.176 --> 20:46.212
The man is dead.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.976
Statues, jewels...

20:50.349 --> 20:52.544
The only thing missing
is the beetles.

20:55.421 --> 20:56.888
(neck cracking)

21:19.145 --> 21:22.949
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.484
Waiting for us to enter.

21:25.484 --> 21:28.721
Waiting to enter us.

21:28.721 --> 21:35.320
Until next time, try
to enjoy the daylight.
