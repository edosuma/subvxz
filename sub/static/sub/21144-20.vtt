WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:03.877
Hey, guys! We're here
with Bernie to do the...

00:04.079 --> 00:05.504
We're gonna take these shirts,

00:05.581 --> 00:06.839
drench them in water,

00:06.915 --> 00:07.731
roll them into a ball,

00:07.733 --> 00:09.341
and freeze them.

00:09.418 --> 00:10.458
The first person to put on

00:10.494 --> 00:12.177
their frozen shirt wins.

00:12.254 --> 00:13.306
- Drench it in water first.
- All right.

00:13.330 --> 00:15.163
It's a little cold.

00:15.241 --> 00:16.240
- Ready?
- Now we gotta freeze them.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.850
(clock ticking, alarm dings)

00:17.926 --> 00:18.517
- Bernie: All right.
- Frankie: Here we go.

00:18.594 --> 00:19.259
You ready?

00:19.336 --> 00:20.427
Yup.

00:20.504 --> 00:22.104
- Three, two, one, go.
- (whistle trills)

00:24.083 --> 00:25.916
(grunts) Oh, it's so hard.

00:25.918 --> 00:27.751
Okay.

00:27.753 --> 00:30.845
- (laughing) Ah!
- (Bernie shouts)

00:30.923 --> 00:32.756
Haha! I'm... Ooh.

00:32.758 --> 00:34.258
- You almost...
- Ooh!

00:34.260 --> 00:35.517
- What the heck?
- Ah!

00:35.594 --> 00:36.777
- (screams)
- No!

00:36.853 --> 00:39.020
Go! Go, go, go!

00:39.098 --> 00:42.190
- No!
- That's a thumb! It's a thumb!

00:42.268 --> 00:44.117
Oh, it's so cold!
Come on, guys, hurry up,

00:44.194 --> 00:44.451
- so I can take it off.
- (grunts)

00:44.528 --> 00:46.286
Ah!

00:46.363 --> 00:49.048
- Oh! Oh! Oh! (Screaming)
- No! No! No! No!

00:49.124 --> 00:51.550
- (cheering)
- Yes! Yes!

00:51.627 --> 00:52.627
Oh, it's right here.

00:53.946 --> 00:55.203
Yeah!

00:55.281 --> 00:56.889
So, in conclusion,

00:56.965 --> 00:59.207
I am the reigning champ.

00:59.285 --> 01:00.686
I don't wanna put this on,
it's so cold.

01:00.710 --> 01:02.052
I did it.

01:57.526 --> 01:59.192
Welcome to Vuuugle!

02:01.680 --> 02:04.681
Paige, you know
how I feel about confetti.

02:04.683 --> 02:05.723
It's just fancy littering.

02:07.853 --> 02:09.853
Sorry, it wasn't for you.

02:09.855 --> 02:11.964
Uh, my cousin, Tessa,
just flew in

02:12.040 --> 02:13.540
and is gonna be here any minute.

02:13.617 --> 02:14.686
You're right. Jade,
that new girl at school,

02:14.710 --> 02:15.710
is awful.

02:17.787 --> 02:19.147
All right,
guess I'll stop talking.

02:19.214 --> 02:21.140
That would be nice.

02:21.216 --> 02:22.496
I was in the middle
of something.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.061
You wouldn't believe
what Jade did today.

02:38.550 --> 02:41.994
She stole all the water
in the school.

02:42.070 --> 02:44.329
I doubt she stole all the water.

02:44.406 --> 02:46.056
Are you accusing me
of exaggerating?

02:46.058 --> 02:47.741
You weren't there

02:47.817 --> 02:49.393
when thousands
of thirsty children

02:49.395 --> 02:50.669
marched through the school,

02:50.746 --> 02:54.748
begging and screaming
for even a single drop of water.

02:56.735 --> 03:00.253
So in this scenario,
you just stood by

03:00.330 --> 03:02.330
and watched thousands
of people die of thirst?

03:02.408 --> 03:04.568
You weren't there, you don't
know the things I've seen!

03:05.928 --> 03:07.168
Jade is a bad person.

03:07.246 --> 03:09.596
But how do you know?
Have you ever talked to her?

03:09.673 --> 03:11.248
I don't need to talk to her.

03:11.250 --> 03:12.530
Judging people is my superpower.

03:14.420 --> 03:15.343
Some heroes can fly,

03:15.421 --> 03:17.087
some are invisible.

03:17.089 --> 03:18.583
I can tell when someone
is a bad person.

03:18.607 --> 03:23.518
Oh, yeah. That's the superhero
movie everyone's dying to see.

03:23.595 --> 03:25.487
The Adventures
of Judgement Girl.

03:27.599 --> 03:29.093
Hey, you attach Emma Stone,
it's a hit.

03:29.117 --> 03:29.616
Well, you're right,
she is a national treasure.

03:29.693 --> 03:31.025
Mm-hmm.

03:31.103 --> 03:34.713
(sighs) Look, you shouldn't
judge a book by its cover.

03:34.790 --> 03:35.841
I guarantee if you give
this Jade girl a chance

03:35.865 --> 03:38.050
and actually talk to her,

03:38.126 --> 03:39.270
you'll see she's a good person.

03:39.294 --> 03:41.111
Ugh! Fine.

03:41.113 --> 03:42.446
But only to show you
how awful she is.

03:42.448 --> 03:45.873
Then I can hear you sing
the "I Was Wrong Song."

03:45.951 --> 03:47.595
- That's not a thing.
- Oh, it's a thing, sister.

03:47.619 --> 03:48.952
♪ I was wrong ♪

03:48.954 --> 03:50.971
♪ I was wrong ♪

03:51.047 --> 03:52.047
You figure out the rest.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.235
- Paige!
- Tessa!

03:56.311 --> 03:59.479
Oh, shoot. Um... Ha...

03:59.556 --> 04:01.523
Welcome to Vuuugle!

04:03.151 --> 04:04.317
Uh, Frankie ruined it.

04:06.321 --> 04:07.373
Ah, it's so nice to see you!

04:07.397 --> 04:08.638
Tessa!

04:08.640 --> 04:10.064
You ready for
your tour of Vuuugle?

04:10.142 --> 04:11.399
We, uh, have a slide,

04:11.477 --> 04:14.035
- a guy with a horse face...
- Where's Bernie Schotz?

04:15.905 --> 04:18.406
Uh... probably in his office.

04:18.484 --> 04:20.908
Take a left at the furnace,
go down to the basement,

04:20.986 --> 04:22.502
then follow the sound of crying.

04:24.323 --> 04:26.656
Sweet!

04:26.658 --> 04:29.138
I can't wait to meet the smartest,
most successful agent alive!

04:31.513 --> 04:32.753
She got the "alive" part right.

04:34.850 --> 04:37.258
Hey, you know who else would be
really good as Judgment Girl?

04:37.336 --> 04:38.518
- Hm? (Gasps)
- Anna Kendrick.

04:38.595 --> 04:39.595
She would be good.

04:45.511 --> 04:47.777
Aw. I thought
that would be cooler.

04:50.349 --> 04:53.199
Wow, Bernie Schotz!

04:53.276 --> 04:55.018
I'm Paige's cousin Tessa.

04:55.020 --> 04:56.853
I'm a huge fan.

04:56.855 --> 04:57.704
What?

04:57.781 --> 05:00.132
I mean, why?

05:00.208 --> 05:01.800
I mean, how?

05:01.877 --> 05:04.303
I mean, cool, cool.

05:06.031 --> 05:09.215
I watched your online commercial
for Bernie Schotz Entertainment

05:09.292 --> 05:11.143
like 20 times.

05:11.219 --> 05:13.979
Your confidence is inspiring.

05:14.056 --> 05:15.221
Yeah, I'm a pretty cool guy.

05:22.381 --> 05:24.806
I have so many questions.

05:24.883 --> 05:26.474
Like, what are your plans
for the future?

05:26.493 --> 05:29.986
Well, I was thinking about
having soup for lunch.

05:32.224 --> 05:35.575
Okay. That's... okay.

05:37.563 --> 05:41.173
I was actually talking about
the future of your company.

05:41.249 --> 05:42.507
It could be massive.

05:42.584 --> 05:45.569
Just think of all the stuff
you can put out there.

05:45.571 --> 05:49.089
Movies, TV, toy...

05:49.165 --> 05:50.240
Toilets!

05:50.242 --> 05:52.092
Toys.

05:52.168 --> 05:54.077
Pfft, obviously.

05:54.079 --> 05:55.670
That was a test.

05:55.747 --> 05:57.004
You passed.

05:57.082 --> 06:01.693
But it is time to take things
to the next level.

06:01.770 --> 06:04.921
Bernie Schotz Entertainment
is no more.

06:04.923 --> 06:07.774
Say hello to Bernie Schotz
Entertainment and Other Stuff!

06:09.595 --> 06:11.461
Or Bernie Schotz Enterprises...

06:11.463 --> 06:13.096
Enterprises! I said it first.

06:13.098 --> 06:15.599
Hey, you're a pretty smart kid

06:15.601 --> 06:17.450
and I could use some help
around here.

06:17.527 --> 06:19.603
How would you like to be
my assassin?

06:19.605 --> 06:21.880
You mean assistant?

06:21.957 --> 06:23.557
Yeah, sure,
I could use one of those too.

06:29.372 --> 06:31.556
Look at her,
completely hydrated.

06:31.633 --> 06:32.633
It's disgusting!

06:35.303 --> 06:37.137
Just go talk to her.

06:37.213 --> 06:38.713
I bet she's way nicer
than you think.

06:38.790 --> 06:41.733
Nah, not interested. And there's
nothing you can do to make...

06:41.810 --> 06:44.029
(in deep voice): Hey, Jade, it's
me, Frankie! I have glasses!

06:44.053 --> 06:45.720
No.

06:45.797 --> 06:47.237
Aah! That's
a really good impression.

06:48.391 --> 06:51.076
I'm sorry,
were you talking to me?

06:51.153 --> 06:53.245
Uh, yeah. I'm Frankie.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.414
So...

06:55.490 --> 06:56.542
you like a lot of water, huh?

06:56.566 --> 07:00.143
(giggles) I know, right?

07:00.145 --> 07:02.587
I'm so sorry about this
giant water bottle.

07:02.664 --> 07:04.481
The little girl I
mentor gave it to me.

07:04.483 --> 07:05.924
I feel like if I don't use it

07:06.001 --> 07:07.259
then I'm giving up on her.

07:07.335 --> 07:08.652
Paige: Aw.

07:08.654 --> 07:09.654
Aw! (Groans)

07:12.324 --> 07:14.507
Thanks for talking to me.

07:14.584 --> 07:16.935
I'm new here and haven't
made any friends yet.

07:17.012 --> 07:19.162
Oh, yeah, my first day
here was really hard too.

07:19.164 --> 07:20.439
Paige: Aw, they're bonding!

07:22.425 --> 07:23.558
Paige, just come out.

07:26.171 --> 07:29.339
Hey. Uh, I'm Paige.

07:29.341 --> 07:31.766
Just dropped something back here

07:31.843 --> 07:33.483
that took your whole
conversation to find.

07:35.030 --> 07:37.104
Oh, hey, I like your jacket.

07:37.182 --> 07:41.293
Thanks, I got it for like five bucks at a
thrift store and I zhushed it up myself.

07:41.369 --> 07:43.353
Ooh, zhushed.
I've never said "zhushed."

07:43.355 --> 07:44.871
I like it.
We should say that more.

07:44.948 --> 07:49.375
Paige Olvera, I zhush you to
seven years on the Planet Zhush.

07:49.452 --> 07:51.619
Not if I use this Zhush!

07:51.697 --> 07:53.805
Both: Zhush! Zhush!
Zhush! Zhush! Zhush!

07:53.882 --> 07:56.049
You guys are so funny!

07:56.125 --> 07:57.884
Hey, I know we just met,

07:57.961 --> 08:01.313
but do you guys wanna come over
to my house tomorrow and hang?

08:01.389 --> 08:03.297
Well, I'm free.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.983
How about you, Frankie?

08:05.060 --> 08:07.301
Sure, why not?

08:07.379 --> 08:08.619
Great, I'll see you guys later.

08:10.306 --> 08:12.157
Haha! I was right!

08:12.234 --> 08:13.492
You were wrong!

08:13.568 --> 08:15.719
Jade is nice.

08:15.721 --> 08:17.829
Hey.

08:17.906 --> 08:20.056
Remember when we said
we'd rob that house

08:20.058 --> 08:22.058
if we ever found two idiots
we could pin it on?

08:22.060 --> 08:24.077
Well, I found them.

08:24.153 --> 08:27.506
- Zhush!
- Both: Zhush! Zhush! Zhush! Zhush! Zhush! Zhush!

08:31.069 --> 08:32.752
What's up guys?
Paige and Frankie here.

08:32.829 --> 08:34.215
As you know,
doing things blindfolded

08:34.239 --> 08:35.997
can be tough.

08:36.074 --> 08:37.385
But not when you spend
all day practicing.

08:37.409 --> 08:38.742
High five, Paige.

08:38.744 --> 08:40.577
(buzzer)

08:40.579 --> 08:42.912
Well, that was a waste
of nine hours.

08:42.914 --> 08:44.514
Today, Frankie and I
are going to play...

08:45.008 --> 08:45.524
We're gonna take turns

08:45.600 --> 08:47.008
being blindfolded,

08:47.085 --> 08:49.085
and then we're gonna
try to make as many baskets

08:49.087 --> 08:49.677
as we can.

08:49.755 --> 08:51.588
Are you ready?

08:51.590 --> 08:52.605
This is gonna be a mess.

08:52.682 --> 08:53.682
Go!

08:55.427 --> 08:56.368
Close! Close, close.
Close. Lower.

08:56.444 --> 08:57.610
Shoot lower, lower.

08:57.687 --> 08:59.779
No! So close, so close.

08:59.856 --> 09:01.948
Um, a little bit, like, less.

09:02.025 --> 09:04.525
- (laughing)
- Follow the sound of my voice.

09:04.603 --> 09:06.163
- Ahh!
- You... I don't want to hit you.

09:07.939 --> 09:09.174
- Ye... (groans) Nope.
- Frankie: Yes! Yes.

09:09.198 --> 09:10.123
- So I completely failed.
- (buzzer)

09:10.199 --> 09:12.050
Let's see if Paige
does any better.

09:12.127 --> 09:13.718
To the left.

09:13.795 --> 09:15.779
Ooh! You hit the hoop this time.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.621
- I did? Okay.
- Just a little less aggravated.

09:17.783 --> 09:18.372
Both: Aww!

09:18.450 --> 09:19.724
(gasps, screams)

09:21.787 --> 09:23.061
Both: Whoo!

09:23.138 --> 09:24.138
(both screaming)

09:25.457 --> 09:26.547
Both: Whoo!

09:26.625 --> 09:28.066
- Nope.
- Both: Whoo!

09:28.143 --> 09:29.309
Woohoo. No.

09:29.385 --> 09:31.218
Woohoo! Oh!

09:31.296 --> 09:32.296
(screams)

09:34.800 --> 09:35.943
- Blindfolded!
- I'm ready to start

09:35.967 --> 09:37.317
my professional
basketball career

09:37.393 --> 09:38.818
with blindfolds on.

09:38.895 --> 09:40.820
I can play with my eyes open.

09:40.897 --> 09:42.488
- I'm the opposite.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh.

09:42.565 --> 09:45.566
- I can make a lot of baskets with my eyes open.
- Ohh! Mm-hmm.

09:45.644 --> 09:46.993
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:47.070 --> 09:49.646
- Nope.
- (laughs)

09:49.648 --> 09:51.248
- But not blindfolded.
- (Paige mouthing)

09:54.502 --> 09:59.155
(pre-alarm beeping)

09:59.157 --> 10:01.082
I feel like such a dork.

10:01.159 --> 10:03.084
Invite new friends over,
and I forget my key.

10:03.161 --> 10:04.161
Classic Jade.

10:06.164 --> 10:07.439
Nah, I think it's fun

10:07.515 --> 10:09.160
'cause it feels like
we're breaking the rules,

10:09.184 --> 10:10.850
but we're not.

10:10.927 --> 10:13.407
Oh, sorry, give me a sec. I'm
just gonna go turn off the alarm.

10:15.006 --> 10:16.939
(beeping continuing)

10:23.849 --> 10:24.849
(beeping stops)

10:26.442 --> 10:27.459
Make yourself at home.

10:27.535 --> 10:28.535
The kitchen is...

10:30.355 --> 10:31.355
downstairs.

10:32.524 --> 10:34.207
Wow!

10:34.283 --> 10:35.950
This house is so cool!

10:36.027 --> 10:38.378
I know, it's so fancy.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.287
- Huh!
- Hey, Jade, what should we do first?

10:40.365 --> 10:41.531
Jade: Uh, I have an idea.

10:41.533 --> 10:43.216
How about we play a game

10:43.292 --> 10:45.932
called "How much of my mom's jewelry
can I fit on my body at once?"

10:48.373 --> 10:49.373
Wait a minute.

10:51.726 --> 10:54.319
That's not fair!
You got a head start.

10:54.396 --> 10:56.713
(giggles) Well, then
jump in on the fun, guys.

10:56.715 --> 10:58.898
- (phone ringing)
- Oh, hang on a sec.

11:00.552 --> 11:01.552
Just gotta grab this.

11:03.889 --> 11:04.888
Yeah, I'm almost done.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.999
Have the car outside in five.

11:08.076 --> 11:09.796
Don't be late,
or I'll break your other arm.

11:10.912 --> 11:12.412
Aw, shucks!

11:12.488 --> 11:14.839
That was my mom.

11:14.916 --> 11:18.902
I forgot. My family's donating a bunch
of stuff to charity this weekend

11:18.904 --> 11:21.087
and I haven't
packed up anything.

11:21.164 --> 11:22.884
I guess we'll have
to hang out another time.

11:24.910 --> 11:26.926
Well... maybe we could help.

11:29.431 --> 11:32.023
You guys are so nice!

11:32.100 --> 11:33.416
Grab a suitcase
and start stuffing.

11:33.418 --> 11:34.418
It's all going.

11:39.257 --> 11:41.758
Hey, how about these books?

11:41.760 --> 11:43.600
You know, you can't judge them
by their covers.

11:45.447 --> 11:47.038
Nah, no books.

11:47.115 --> 11:49.766
This charity really wants gold.

11:49.768 --> 11:50.768
And laptops.

11:52.695 --> 11:54.055
Yeah, Paige,
you're donating wrong.

11:55.457 --> 11:57.342
Hey, can you guys go look out
the window for a sec?

11:57.366 --> 11:59.551
Why?

11:59.627 --> 12:02.203
(sighs) We're on our
phones all the time,

12:02.280 --> 12:06.224
when was the last time
appreciated nature?

12:06.301 --> 12:09.469
Wow, Jade. You are so deep.

12:15.293 --> 12:17.627
(sighs)

12:17.629 --> 12:20.855
I feel like we're a part of
something really special right now.

12:23.635 --> 12:25.151
Yeah.

12:25.228 --> 12:28.229
Hey!

12:28.306 --> 12:29.450
Jade, I'm gonna hit up
your kitchen real quick.

12:29.474 --> 12:30.573
Cool.

12:35.997 --> 12:37.830
Paige (thinking): That's weird.

12:37.907 --> 12:39.427
Jade's not in any
of her family photos.

12:41.987 --> 12:44.378
And there's a hole
where the TV used to be.

12:47.158 --> 12:48.558
And she's stuffing money
into her...

12:50.419 --> 12:52.495
Oh, my gosh!
She's robbing the house!

12:52.497 --> 12:53.997
Oh, my gosh!

12:53.999 --> 12:54.999
We're robbing the house!

12:56.184 --> 12:58.184
Aah!

12:58.261 --> 12:59.261
Oh...

13:01.339 --> 13:02.855
(shouting)

13:08.530 --> 13:09.530
(calculator whirs)

13:11.440 --> 13:12.440
(calculator whirs)

13:13.852 --> 13:15.535
And that's...

13:15.611 --> 13:16.611
how you draw a puppy.

13:18.706 --> 13:21.707
Yeah, that's great,
but I asked you about

13:21.784 --> 13:23.704
your business plan
for Bernie Schotz Enterprises?

13:24.195 --> 13:25.920
Tessa, come here.

13:30.201 --> 13:31.551
I wanna teach you something.

13:31.627 --> 13:35.129
What do all the greatest
companies have in common?

13:35.206 --> 13:36.389
A coherent plan of action

13:36.465 --> 13:39.375
that takes into account
current economic trends...

13:39.377 --> 13:40.543
I'm gonna stop you right there

13:40.545 --> 13:42.320
because you are
very, very wrong.

13:42.397 --> 13:47.141
It's that they all threw huge,
awesome launch parties!

13:47.218 --> 13:48.718
I really think
we should have a product

13:48.720 --> 13:51.162
before we spend a lot of
money to throw a party.

13:51.239 --> 13:52.813
Party.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.011
Glad we're on the same page.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.988
Jade's a bad person.
Frankie was right.

14:01.066 --> 14:03.249
She does have superpowers.

14:03.326 --> 14:04.825
What do I have?

14:04.903 --> 14:07.420
A braid and a small carbon footprint!
That's nothing!

14:10.575 --> 14:12.091
Hey, uh, Frankie,
I think we should

14:12.168 --> 14:13.000
- head home.
- Listen, Paige.

14:13.078 --> 14:14.519
I want to apologize.

14:14.596 --> 14:16.913
Oh, oh. No need.
I'm ready to move on.

14:16.915 --> 14:18.915
In fact, I think we should
move on out of here

14:18.917 --> 14:20.583
- and go home.
- No, no, no. Please, please, please.

14:20.585 --> 14:21.508
Don't rush me.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.144
I want to speak slowly, so I...

14:28.927 --> 14:30.151
choose the right words.

14:31.429 --> 14:33.371
Gah...

14:33.448 --> 14:34.909
You were right.
Jade is a good person,

14:34.933 --> 14:36.213
and the fact that
I didn't listen

14:36.284 --> 14:39.602
- to you about it is representative...
- Yup. Totally.

14:39.604 --> 14:40.770
- Of a bigger issue in our friendship.
- You're right! Hey...

14:40.772 --> 14:42.007
Yes, I think we should go home!

14:42.031 --> 14:46.033
Uh... I mean, she made us
feel so comfortable.

14:46.111 --> 14:48.553
Like her stuff is our stuff.

14:48.630 --> 14:49.946
Like, like this.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.631
And, and, and this.

14:51.707 --> 14:53.783
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:53.785 --> 14:55.952
Touching everything.

14:55.954 --> 14:58.304
Ooh! Have you seen
this craft table?

14:58.381 --> 15:00.547
You could see your
fingerprints in the clay.

15:00.625 --> 15:01.807
Gah!

15:04.129 --> 15:06.569
Or you can roll it up into a ball
and throw it out the window.

15:06.631 --> 15:09.315
(chuckles) Look, my point is,

15:09.392 --> 15:10.575
I need to listen to you more.

15:10.652 --> 15:13.653
And to remember this moment
of personal growth,

15:13.729 --> 15:15.580
let's post a photo
for all the world to see.

15:15.657 --> 15:16.657
- No!
- Oh.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.660
Sorry, I sneezed.

15:21.479 --> 15:22.812
Achoo!

15:22.814 --> 15:24.647
(door closes)

15:24.649 --> 15:26.129
Man: Oh, no.
Honey, we've been robbed!

15:29.988 --> 15:31.420
Thanks for your help, dummies.

15:33.158 --> 15:34.158
What?

15:39.180 --> 15:40.262
(clattering)

15:42.834 --> 15:43.834
Paige, what's going on?

15:45.428 --> 15:47.428
Jade's a bad person,

15:47.505 --> 15:49.614
and she was just using us
to rob this house.

15:49.691 --> 15:51.598
Haha! I was right!

15:51.676 --> 15:53.359
Oh, we're gonna be
in so much trouble.

15:54.862 --> 15:57.530
- I know.
- (sighs)

15:57.606 --> 15:59.849
(gasps) Oh, hey. You know who else would
be really good as Judgement Girl?

15:59.851 --> 16:01.292
- Hm?
- Scarlett Johansson.

16:01.369 --> 16:06.038
Ooh, Scar Jo! Yes! We should
start writing the script.

16:06.115 --> 16:08.035
We'll have a lot of time
to work on it in prison!

16:12.697 --> 16:14.714
Hey, guys! Have you ever
flung your shoe

16:14.790 --> 16:16.510
into a basket and yelled,
"Yes! 100 points!"?

16:16.534 --> 16:17.791
Nope, no one has.

16:17.869 --> 16:21.128
It's a really weird thing
to do out of context.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.686
Well, today we will.
We are playing...

16:23.132 --> 16:24.816
We are going to use our feet

16:24.892 --> 16:25.650
to fling as many shoes

16:25.727 --> 16:27.134
into these baskets

16:27.212 --> 16:28.060
- as we can.
- Each basket is worth

16:28.137 --> 16:29.395
a different amount of points,

16:29.472 --> 16:32.548
and the person with
the most points at the end wins.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.050
All right, let's get started.

16:34.052 --> 16:35.379
And for absolutely
no reason at all,

16:35.403 --> 16:37.553
we've invited Horse Face Guy
to cheer us on.

16:37.555 --> 16:38.755
- (horse neighs)
- (bell dings)

16:39.557 --> 16:41.057
Frankie: That's nice. Okay.

16:41.059 --> 16:42.059
Oh.

16:43.411 --> 16:44.910
Both: Oh!

16:44.987 --> 16:47.171
- So clo...
- Both: Oh... Oh!

16:47.248 --> 16:49.248
There we go. That's why
Horse Face Guy's here.

16:49.325 --> 16:51.303
- Oh! That makes so much more sense.
- To fix the baskets.

16:51.327 --> 16:51.825
- Frankie: Of course.
- (bells dinging)

16:51.903 --> 16:53.903
That's nice.

16:53.905 --> 16:55.496
Ohh!

16:55.573 --> 16:56.997
- 10!
- Yeah!

16:57.075 --> 16:58.349
Shoot for the stars.

16:58.426 --> 16:59.925
Both: (gasping) Oh!

17:00.002 --> 17:01.093
- So close!
- (shouting)

17:02.747 --> 17:04.080
Oh! Aw.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.306
(gasps) Ahh!

17:06.918 --> 17:08.100
Thank you, Horse Face!

17:08.177 --> 17:10.194
- You are my biggest fan.
- (horse neighs)

17:11.756 --> 17:13.847
Oh! Oh, oh!

17:13.925 --> 17:15.199
(both cheering)

17:16.427 --> 17:18.152
Both: Oh, oh! (Groaning)

17:20.265 --> 17:22.040
(cheering)

17:22.116 --> 17:24.950
If I could do a back flip
right now, I totally would.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.454
(laughs)

17:28.623 --> 17:29.789
Frankie: Whoo!

17:29.865 --> 17:31.457
Both: Oh!

17:31.534 --> 17:32.534
(Frankie laughs)

17:34.612 --> 17:36.629
Whoo!

17:36.705 --> 17:40.224
And when you dominate at Shoe Fly,
there's only one thing you can do.

17:40.301 --> 17:41.301
Dance!

17:48.309 --> 17:49.901
What are we gonna do?
We gotta hide!

17:49.977 --> 17:51.235
I think we should come clean.

17:51.312 --> 17:53.296
Are you crazy? They don't
even know we're up here.

17:53.298 --> 17:55.138
- Man: They're upstairs.
- No, you're upstairs!

17:56.317 --> 17:57.241
Sorry, bad habit.

17:57.318 --> 17:58.910
- I... Oh, no.
- (footsteps approaching)

17:58.986 --> 18:00.561
They're coming.

18:00.638 --> 18:03.322
Let's jump out that window and
hope the cactus garden moved.

18:03.399 --> 18:05.308
No, wait, Frankie!

18:05.310 --> 18:06.900
We're innocent.

18:06.978 --> 18:09.098
I'm sure if we tell them
the truth, they'll let us go.

18:10.315 --> 18:12.414
Hello? We're in here.

18:17.822 --> 18:20.080
It's okay,
we're not who you're after.

18:20.158 --> 18:21.841
But you're in our house.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.601
And you're wearing
my wife's pearls.

18:23.678 --> 18:24.769
(chuckles)

18:30.126 --> 18:32.335
I know how this looks.

18:32.337 --> 18:34.112
But this girl
tricked us into robbing you.

18:34.188 --> 18:36.339
As soon as we realized,
we stopped.

18:36.341 --> 18:37.857
Because we're good people.

18:39.510 --> 18:40.510
Like you.

18:44.015 --> 18:45.514
Well, thank you
for being honest with us.

18:45.516 --> 18:48.609
The truth is, all this stuff
is just material possessions.

18:48.686 --> 18:49.943
(sighs)

18:50.021 --> 18:53.539
The only thing in this house
that I can't replace

18:53.616 --> 18:55.541
is the clay made from
my grandmother's ashes.

19:01.366 --> 19:02.473
(handcuffs clicking)

19:02.550 --> 19:06.051
♪ I was wrong, I was wrong ♪

19:06.128 --> 19:06.886
Big finish, girlfriend.

19:06.962 --> 19:10.373
♪ I was wrong! ♪

19:10.375 --> 19:12.215
Can you please get these
girls out of my house?

19:16.381 --> 19:17.901
- (chattering)
- (upbeat music playing)

19:23.312 --> 19:25.830
This party is great, Tessa.

19:25.907 --> 19:27.331
Well, the party was your idea.

19:27.408 --> 19:29.241
I just took care of the...

19:31.078 --> 19:32.119
everything.

19:34.399 --> 19:36.340
Yeah, it was my idea.

19:36.417 --> 19:38.009
Hey, who are those people?

19:38.085 --> 19:41.995
Oh. I invited investors
from the business community.

19:42.073 --> 19:44.924
I wonder why they're not mingling
with the people I invited.

19:49.263 --> 19:50.521
Is one of them a mannequin?

19:53.584 --> 19:55.267
It's pronounced magician.

19:58.606 --> 20:01.774
Excuse me, what are these
crushed up chips in a bag?

20:01.850 --> 20:03.517
Those are snacks I made.

20:03.594 --> 20:07.354
I mean, who can eat a full size
chip without hurting themselves?

20:07.432 --> 20:08.832
Literally everyone
who's not a baby.

20:10.435 --> 20:11.709
And also, most babies.

20:11.786 --> 20:16.029
I'm sorry. I have a very
important magic show to watch,

20:16.107 --> 20:18.290
so... do you have a point?

20:18.367 --> 20:19.920
Well, your chip bags
are the only things here

20:19.944 --> 20:22.220
with the Bernie Schotz logo
on it,

20:22.296 --> 20:24.096
so I assume it's the product
you're launching?

20:25.541 --> 20:27.541
Uh... This isn't good.

20:27.618 --> 20:28.801
Or is it?

20:28.877 --> 20:31.229
It's not.

20:31.305 --> 20:35.474
I'm not looking to invest in a
company that sells broken chips.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.050
Seems like
a joke business to me.

20:37.128 --> 20:39.395
And the only jokes I like
are money.

20:41.148 --> 20:43.241
No! No, wait, I can fix this.

20:45.303 --> 20:47.820
(record scratches, music stops)

20:47.896 --> 20:49.247
Thank you for coming, everyone!

20:49.323 --> 20:52.324
I just wanted to clarify
that the broken chips

20:52.401 --> 20:55.086
are a smart, delicious,
and safe snack.

20:55.162 --> 20:57.571
But they are not what Bernie
Schotz Enterprises is all about.

20:57.648 --> 21:00.091
So what is your company about?

21:00.167 --> 21:01.425
Uh...

21:01.502 --> 21:05.671
Let me answer that question
with another question.

21:07.082 --> 21:08.082
Uh...

21:09.327 --> 21:10.509
Help?

21:10.586 --> 21:12.270
Come on.

21:12.346 --> 21:13.746
- (crowd groaning)
- I mean, what...

21:16.667 --> 21:19.426
What Mr. Schotz
meant to say was,

21:19.504 --> 21:22.446
he made a video to show
the potential of his company.

21:22.523 --> 21:23.839
I did?

21:23.841 --> 21:24.841
He did.

21:25.934 --> 21:26.934
Here it is.

21:28.696 --> 21:30.346
Tessa:
Bernie Schotz Entertainment

21:30.348 --> 21:32.031
used to just focus
on Vuuugle stars.

21:33.684 --> 21:38.037
But now, the company is taking
things to the next level

21:38.113 --> 21:40.298
with Bernie Schotz Enterprises.

21:42.618 --> 21:44.877
He will conquer sports,

21:44.953 --> 21:46.620
concerts,

21:46.697 --> 21:47.863
fashion...

21:47.865 --> 21:48.881
And toilets!

21:50.384 --> 21:51.809
Saved it.

21:53.704 --> 21:54.812
Tessa: Thank you, everyone.

21:54.889 --> 21:57.873
We hope you'll join
the Bernie Schotz team!

21:57.875 --> 21:58.932
Yeah.

22:05.399 --> 22:07.140
I had my doubts,

22:07.218 --> 22:11.570
but I am confident that Bernie Schotz
Enterprises has a bright future.

22:11.647 --> 22:17.168
And I must admit, your crushed
chips are a safer way to snack.

22:17.244 --> 22:18.494
I think we can do business.

22:19.897 --> 22:20.897
Ow!

22:22.917 --> 22:24.416
Tessa.

22:26.571 --> 22:27.639
I couldn't have
pulled this off without you.

22:27.663 --> 22:30.181
This party was a huge success.

22:30.257 --> 22:31.682
You really saved my butt.

22:31.759 --> 22:32.999
Thank you.

22:33.077 --> 22:34.352
You're welcome.

22:34.428 --> 22:38.097
So, you wanna keep working
for Bernie Schotz Enterprises?

22:38.173 --> 22:40.024
Bernie, come here.

22:43.270 --> 22:45.437
I'll be honest.

22:45.514 --> 22:47.154
You're not as smart
as I thought you were.

22:48.109 --> 22:53.946
But working for you will get me
out of violin lessons, so...

22:54.022 --> 22:57.691
I don't know, I guess let's grow a
business together or something?

22:57.768 --> 23:00.436
Your confidence in me

23:00.438 --> 23:02.204
is inspiring.

23:05.292 --> 23:06.384
Hey, man!

23:09.780 --> 23:11.889
Hey, coz.
Where have you two been?

23:11.966 --> 23:16.727
Let's just say you're looking at a
couple of straight-up criminals.

23:16.804 --> 23:20.881
'Cause we just did
some hard time in the slammer.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.734
Jail? How long
were you guys in there?

23:23.811 --> 23:26.731
15 minutes. Then they caught the real
criminal, my mom came to pick us up.

23:29.133 --> 23:33.152
But those prison guards
ain't gonna forget us.

23:33.228 --> 23:35.228
'Cause they all had kids
who were Bizaardvark fans.

23:36.140 --> 23:37.306
Oh, well.

23:37.308 --> 23:38.588
- Hey, wanna get a drink?
- Yeah.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.237
What's this party for, anyway?

23:44.315 --> 23:45.555
No idea. This is a weird place.

23:47.075 --> 23:48.575
Did you see that?

23:48.653 --> 23:50.428
She took the last drink

23:50.504 --> 23:51.654
right as I reached for it.

23:51.656 --> 23:53.597
What a terrible person.

23:53.674 --> 23:55.883
Frankie, I'm sure if
you got to know her, you...

23:57.828 --> 24:03.064
Eh, you're probably right.
