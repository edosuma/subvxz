WEBVTT

00:34.500 --> 00:35.583
Would you cut that out?

00:36.708 --> 00:38.167
Ben, you got your sunblock?
It's going to be hot.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.333
Yeah, I got it.

00:39.333 --> 00:41.208
- Lucy?
- I'm trying to tan.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.083
You don't tan, you burn.

00:45.083 --> 00:47.958
What? Don't blame me.
Blame your Scottish forefathers.

00:48.542 --> 00:50.458
- I blame you.
- Figures.

00:53.125 --> 00:54.625
He did not help.

00:54.625 --> 00:56.125
I blame that on your computer.

00:56.125 --> 00:56.958
You what?

00:56.958 --> 00:58.875
At the turn of the last century,

00:58.875 --> 01:00.917
children your age
worked in coal mines.

01:00.917 --> 01:03.000
I'm pretty sure
you can do the dishes.

01:17.042 --> 01:19.542
- Hi!
- Hi! Look at you!

01:30.625 --> 01:33.208
Here's my girls. Mm.

01:33.417 --> 01:35.292
The Moro sisters.

01:35.292 --> 01:37.417
God help the men
at the Department of Corrections

01:37.417 --> 01:40.292
- for trying to take you two on.
- We do what we can.

01:40.500 --> 01:41.875
Now, how about you?

01:42.333 --> 01:44.542
Two-thirds of a man
and halfway to handsome.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.042
Come on. I've got work for you.

01:47.958 --> 01:49.792
You know what's happening
tomorrow, Benjamin?

01:50.958 --> 01:54.542
The American Government is going
to kill a mentally disabled man.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.875
- What do you think about that?
- I think it's bad.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.292
<i>How much longer you got?</i>

02:27.292 --> 02:29.375
<i>- Next week.
- Next week?</i>

02:29.375 --> 02:30.583
<i>Murderer!</i>

02:31.292 --> 02:32.500
<i>Murderer!</i>

02:34.542 --> 02:35.458
Murderers!

02:36.333 --> 02:37.292
Go back to
where you came from.

02:40.458 --> 02:42.000
Murderer!

03:27.083 --> 03:29.333
<i>Keep to your side
of the fence, please.</i>

03:30.583 --> 03:35.583
<i>Keep to your side of the fence,
please. Stay in your groups.</i>

03:36.375 --> 03:38.167
<i>Stay in your area.</i>

03:38.167 --> 03:39.375
<i>It's been a long wait
for justice.</i>

03:40.375 --> 03:41.292
<i>It's taken its toll</i>

03:42.375 --> 03:43.083
<i>and we're just glad
it's coming to an end.</i>

03:44.417 --> 03:46.333
<i>Now, there's been
significant public backlash</i>

03:46.333 --> 03:49.292
<i>about a mentally disabled man
being put to death.</i>

03:49.917 --> 03:51.458
<i>Do you have any thoughts
on that?</i>

03:51.958 --> 03:54.333
<i>He had sense enough to point a
gun and pull the trigger.</i>

03:54.333 --> 03:56.417
<i>And now he's going
to have to pay for it.</i>

03:57.125 --> 03:59.542
<i>Hopefully, once he's gone
we can all start to move on.</i>

03:59.958 --> 04:01.583
<i>Tensions are expected tomorrow</i>

04:01.583 --> 04:04.167
<i>between two opposing sets of
protesters</i>

04:04.167 --> 04:07.250
<i>with a strong contingent
of anti-death penalty activists</i>

04:07.250 --> 04:08.458
<i>expected to clash with the</i>

04:08.458 --> 04:10.875
<i>American Institute
of Homicide Survivors.</i>

04:11.250 --> 04:13.917
<i>Mr. Bromage is a key member
of the American Institute</i>

04:13.917 --> 04:15.083
<i>of Homicide Survivors...</i>

04:50.917 --> 04:51.833
Hey.

04:53.375 --> 04:56.833
Sorry. Sorry.
I didn't mean to spook you.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.792
Mercy.

05:04.625 --> 05:05.792
What?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.500
I'm Mercy.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.042
That's a pretty fucking
ironic name, don't you think?

05:11.042 --> 05:12.500
Yeah, you got one of your own?

05:13.917 --> 05:14.792
Lucy.

05:17.292 --> 05:18.458
Well, that's pretty.

05:22.292 --> 05:25.083
How are things with the friends
of the gas chamber?

05:27.333 --> 05:30.417
How are things at the
cop killers' benevolent fund?

05:31.000 --> 05:32.958
- Didn't know he was a cop.
- Yeah.

05:33.542 --> 05:37.958
He was off duty, on vacation,
with his wife and kids.

05:41.958 --> 05:44.083
Was that your dad
getting interviewed on TV?

05:44.083 --> 05:45.583
I saw you guys arriving.

05:47.042 --> 05:49.083
Yeah, Mike was his partner at
the CPD.

05:50.917 --> 05:52.042
For 16 years.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.167
I'm sorry for your loss.

06:18.292 --> 06:19.167
Well...

06:20.917 --> 06:22.000
see you tomorrow?

06:23.167 --> 06:24.125
Yeah.

07:02.917 --> 07:03.875
Mom.

07:28.667 --> 07:32.958
<i>♪ And we gotta remember
The Pharaoh's army ♪</i>

07:33.625 --> 07:37.625
<i>♪ They got drowned
In the Red, Red Sea ♪</i>

07:37.667 --> 07:42.125
<i>♪ Oh, Mary don't you weep ♪</i>

07:44.083 --> 07:46.333
<i>♪ Tell your sister Martha</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
<i>♪ Tell Martha not to mourn</i>

08:13.375 --> 08:15.292
When we get back
you could try at The Grill.

08:18.125 --> 08:20.167
They're using my resume
as napkins now.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.208
That's how many times
I've been in there.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
- You need a job.
- I had a job.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.125
Note the past tense there.

08:30.958 --> 08:33.000
Shall we harvest his organs
while he sleeps?

08:34.125 --> 08:36.000
How much you think
we'd get for a kidney?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.083
- What?
- It's weird.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.500
You sleeping here.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.583
You're, like,
three sizes bigger than me.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.375
It's not my fault
you got tiny feet.

10:11.375 --> 10:13.333
It's not my fault
you've got flippers.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.292
Can we get a German Shepard?

10:15.292 --> 10:17.042
Why don't you play
with the neighbor's dog?

10:17.042 --> 10:18.167
The neighbor's dog is dead.

10:18.167 --> 10:19.167
Tough break.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.458
Just stuff some socks in there
or something. It'll be fine.

10:23.458 --> 10:25.542
- What time's your interview?
- In an hour.

10:25.542 --> 10:28.333
Okay, so you'll be home in time
to clean the house?

10:30.125 --> 10:31.250
I guess so. Why?

10:32.292 --> 10:33.333
Weldon's coming over
to talk about the case.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.375
Which bedroom
do you want me to tidy?

10:36.375 --> 10:38.292
Come on, Lucy.
Just help me out, all right?

10:38.292 --> 10:39.500
He said he's got big news.

10:43.042 --> 10:46.167
- Why do you want a dog, anyways?
- Protection, from intruders.

10:51.667 --> 10:54.292
Hey, you need protection?
You got me, all right?

11:24.167 --> 11:25.083
Hi.

11:25.500 --> 11:26.375
Hi.

11:29.292 --> 11:31.208
How was the public hanging?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.375
An affront to moral decency.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.292
How was your weekend?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.500
Likewise.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.333
Now, what's with the outfit?

11:41.667 --> 11:44.417
Just trying to make myself look
more employable.

11:44.958 --> 11:46.083
Is it working?

11:46.917 --> 11:48.083
I don't know. Is it?

11:54.042 --> 11:55.083
You want a drink?

11:56.875 --> 11:57.583
Beer.

12:00.208 --> 12:02.250
- And nuts.
- Hi.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.208
- Katlin.
- Lucy.

12:09.042 --> 12:09.958
Is that a resume?

12:13.125 --> 12:14.000
Yeah.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.583
You hear I'm leaving town?

12:16.583 --> 12:18.917
No, I must have
missed the announcement.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.292
I got a job in Toledo.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.417
Two weeks
and I'm out of this dump.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.542
Toledo.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.208
Being Homecoming Queen's
finally paying off, huh?

12:29.208 --> 12:31.000
Anyway, if I don't see you
between then and now,

12:31.000 --> 12:32.083
have a nice life.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.167
Thanks. It's on my to-do list.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.917
Do you remember
Al Newbury's Christmas party?

12:43.292 --> 12:44.833
I never told anyone, you know.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.042
Told them what?

12:49.333 --> 12:51.500
That you're a pervert.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.417
Good luck in the city.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.250
Say hi to your dad for me.

13:09.375 --> 13:10.625
How long do I have to sit here

13:10.625 --> 13:12.292
before you give me
a fucking job?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.542
I reckon
we're going to find out.

13:34.208 --> 13:37.167
So I have good news
and I have less good news.

13:42.542 --> 13:44.542
We knew it was coming.
It doesn't change anything.

13:49.958 --> 13:52.083
They set the date.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.083
At least now we know.

13:59.875 --> 14:01.000
Four months.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.875
So we got to move fast.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.917
Hey, listen. It'll be fine.

14:08.958 --> 14:10.333
This is what I do,
this is my thing.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.458
I'm good at this.
I promise. Okay?

14:15.083 --> 14:16.500
The good news is the witness.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.167
That's where we need
to be focusing our attention.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.333
You couldn't do it before.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.125
What makes you think
you can do it now?

14:22.125 --> 14:24.500
I've been digging around.
I found an old buddy of his

14:25.000 --> 14:27.292
who told me the guy got thrown
out of college

14:27.292 --> 14:29.833
for smoking too much pot
and missing class.

14:30.375 --> 14:31.417
That's it?

14:31.875 --> 14:33.167
- Lucy.
- That's it?

14:34.458 --> 14:35.917
- Cases have been won on less.
- Maybe in fucking Burma!

14:35.917 --> 14:37.250
- Lucy, shut up.
- No, it's okay.

14:38.542 --> 14:41.208
I'm not pretending this is video
evidence or a signed confession,

14:41.208 --> 14:42.458
but this is something.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.208
Look, the witness is an addict.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.292
He's hopelessly hooked on
marijuana.

14:47.583 --> 14:49.333
He saw the world
through a drug haze.

14:49.917 --> 14:52.417
How could he possibly be sure
he saw what he said he saw

14:53.083 --> 14:54.875
when it was dark,
and he was high?

14:56.958 --> 14:59.417
So you're not trying to prove
that our dad didn't do it?

15:00.083 --> 15:02.167
Discrediting the witness is
basically the same thing.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.458
No! It is not basically
the same thing!

15:04.458 --> 15:06.375
You said you'd prove
he was innocent!

15:06.375 --> 15:08.208
I got four months
before the judge

15:08.208 --> 15:09.625
sends your dad to the chamber.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.583
So I got to work
with what I got to work with.

15:11.583 --> 15:14.000
I'm sure you're going to spend
the time productively.

15:22.042 --> 15:24.500
Lucy, why don't you go check on
Ben and see if he's okay?

15:40.292 --> 15:41.417
<i>Well, I was right.</i>

15:45.500 --> 15:47.167
How'd it go with douchebag?

15:49.333 --> 15:51.083
<i>Well,
aren't you glad you didn't...</i>

15:51.083 --> 15:52.083
Great.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.375
<i>How is that the best...</i>

15:53.375 --> 15:55.583
We're really knocking it
out of the park.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.167
<i>That was the worst...</i>

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
<i>We could take you to the best
place to spin</i>

16:03.000 --> 16:04.083
<i>in the whole forest.</i>

16:05.167 --> 16:07.125
<i>I would very much like that.</i>

16:14.333 --> 16:16.458
How's the pro-boning?

16:18.167 --> 16:19.250
Well, anyway...

16:20.417 --> 16:22.917
when this is all over,
you'll thank me.

16:43.958 --> 16:45.292
I don't want to hear it, Lucy.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.583
You don't have to keep doing it.

16:48.583 --> 16:51.417
- I like Shane.
- He makes me feel ill.

16:51.417 --> 16:54.167
Well, you don't have to talk to
him. Just let me deal with it.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.375
Four months.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.958
A little gas money.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.875
- Aggie, no, no, no.
- No what?

17:43.875 --> 17:46.000
I don't get to spend my money
how I please?

17:46.625 --> 17:47.958
You got friends, girl.

17:48.625 --> 17:49.833
Let me help.

17:53.042 --> 17:54.083
Thanks.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.042
Whose daddy is that?

17:59.167 --> 18:00.000
- Hey, Mandy?
- Whose daddy is that?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.875
Can you make those letters
bigger?

18:03.167 --> 18:05.458
I want the cameras to be able to
read those signs. Okay, honey?

18:10.083 --> 18:11.375
You sound like me.

18:11.375 --> 18:13.000
Oh!

18:14.583 --> 18:16.208
It's funny, isn't it?

18:16.542 --> 18:18.958
- It's funny.
- Good job.

18:29.667 --> 18:30.583
Hi.

18:31.583 --> 18:32.542
Hi.

18:36.042 --> 18:37.958
One execution wasn't
enough for you, huh?

18:39.542 --> 18:42.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I crashing your party?

18:44.333 --> 18:46.083
Technically not a party.

18:47.958 --> 18:49.292
Hey, you got any beer
or anything?

18:49.542 --> 18:53.125
- Uh, got soda.
- I guess that'll have to do.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.042
Okay.

19:03.917 --> 19:05.333
- Here.
- Thanks.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.125
Nice RV.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.375
It's like a million years old.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.125
RV-saurus?

19:20.583 --> 19:22.208
Basically extinct, yeah.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.583
<i>That's it right there.
Real good.</i>

19:36.375 --> 19:37.542
I've got to get back.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.250
I stay in this den of iniquity
too long,

19:40.250 --> 19:42.167
and the good Lord's likely
to strike me down.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.167
Come on.
It's not that bad, is it?

19:44.208 --> 19:45.083
No.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.333
Hey, I was thinking about
walking into town later.

19:49.625 --> 19:50.958
Get a real drink.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.292
You want to come?

19:57.375 --> 19:59.625
- Sure.
- Well, don't sound too excited.

19:59.625 --> 20:03.250
No, it's just I didn't... I
don't think we're supposed to...

20:04.333 --> 20:06.125
- fraternize. I...
- Oh.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.292
Right.
Is there a law against it?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.375
An unwritten one.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
Those are the easiest ones to
break in my experience.

20:15.042 --> 20:17.083
So just go for a smoke
around eight. Okay?

20:18.375 --> 20:20.292
- Okay.
- Try and muster up

20:20.292 --> 20:22.000
- some enthusiasm by then.
- Well, I...

20:25.375 --> 20:27.250
Ben, stop picking
at it. Just eat your food.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.208
It's gross.

20:29.292 --> 20:31.167
I didn't ask
for a review, just eat it.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rewind.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.333
- What do you mean "gross"?
- I mean it's gross.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.000
This is barely food.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.458
Dude. I spent at least
ten minutes making this dish.

20:41.458 --> 20:45.083
I mean, this is my dish.
This is my specialty dish.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.417
- I always make this dish.
- And it always tastes like ass.

20:47.417 --> 20:48.417
Ben!

20:49.708 --> 20:52.583
I mean, I can't even believe
what I'm hearing right now.

20:53.667 --> 20:56.375
I mean, this is the entire
extent of my culinary oeuvre,

20:56.375 --> 20:58.208
and you're telling me
it doesn't even taste good?

20:58.208 --> 20:59.208
Yeah.

21:00.208 --> 21:02.542
It could be time for you
to learn a new recipe.

21:03.042 --> 21:05.292
<i>- Et fucking tu, Martha?
- Lucy.</i>

21:08.250 --> 21:09.458
Mom taught me this.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.250
I'm pretty sure it's the only
dish she could make.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.500
I'm pretty sure it's the only
thing Dad would eat.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.542
She could burn in drive-through,
that woman.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.958
- You used to get drive-through?
- Sometimes.

21:19.958 --> 21:21.375
Anyway, I like it. So...

21:25.250 --> 21:26.542
I'm probably going to be
out late.

21:29.417 --> 21:30.417
For what?

21:31.542 --> 21:32.542
I'm meeting a friend.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.042
You don't have any friends
in Virginia.

21:37.083 --> 21:39.458
Actually, the state motto
for a while, I think.

21:41.292 --> 21:43.000
Can we just get pizza instead?

21:44.167 --> 21:46.208
Oh, my God,
this kid is breaking my heart.

21:46.208 --> 21:48.208
Just eat your ass and cheese.

21:49.417 --> 21:51.500
I mean mac and cheese. God.

22:04.042 --> 22:06.250
- Hi.
- Jesus!

22:21.042 --> 22:23.333
So, you got a boyfriend,
or whatever?

22:24.208 --> 22:25.417
Um, I'm single.

22:27.042 --> 22:30.042
What is wrong with the citizens
of Ohio?

22:32.375 --> 22:35.458
I don't think we have enough
time to answer that question.

22:36.042 --> 22:37.583
Well, it's their loss.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.042
They seem to be coping okay.

22:41.375 --> 22:43.292
They don't appreciate a vision
of perfection when they see one.

22:48.917 --> 22:51.375
Uh, do you have a boyfriend,
or whatever?

22:52.625 --> 22:54.167
I'm between boyfriends.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.583
- That sounds uncomfortable.
- Yeah, it is.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.000
- Well, I am seeing this guy.
- He sounds like a jerk.

23:04.458 --> 23:07.375
Ohio.
It has a nice ring to it.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.042
Spoken like someone
who's never been there.

23:10.917 --> 23:13.375
- What about you?
- Bastogne, Illinois.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.083
They don't have the death
penalty in Illinois.

23:16.958 --> 23:19.542
You can imagine the letters
my mother has written.

23:21.542 --> 23:24.083
- What do you do there?
- I work in a law firm.

23:24.917 --> 23:27.208
- Like, as a lawyer?
- Junior lawyer.

23:28.167 --> 23:29.208
I hate lawyers.

23:30.125 --> 23:31.292
Thanks!

23:32.042 --> 23:33.000
You seem okay.

23:36.042 --> 23:37.083
Two beers.

23:56.542 --> 23:57.542
So why'd you come back?

23:59.042 --> 24:02.375
Um, I don't know, having
those people there for us.

24:02.375 --> 24:03.542
It made a difference.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.542
I guess I just wanted to give
something back.

24:10.542 --> 24:12.500
How come you didn't go
in and watch too?

24:13.167 --> 24:17.000
Wow. You really do just
spy on me at these things, huh?

24:17.208 --> 24:20.208
Well, you come all that way and
you missed the big show. I...

24:21.250 --> 24:23.125
just figure that's the best bit
for you.

24:25.042 --> 24:27.125
I'm glad he's dead. How's that?

24:28.125 --> 24:29.208
Kind of scary.

24:30.500 --> 24:32.083
My dad will never be the same.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.208
Everything will always be
a little bit worse.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.125
My dad will always be a little
bit worse.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.458
That man destroyed my world.

24:39.667 --> 24:42.250
Now he's dead. I move on.
So fuck him.

24:43.542 --> 24:44.958
Lady Vengeance.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.375
That was intense.

24:51.625 --> 24:53.042
So how'd you get into it then?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.125
Your mom make you?

24:56.042 --> 24:58.333
Martha's not my mom.
She's my sister.

25:00.292 --> 25:01.542
And that was
your little brother?

25:01.542 --> 25:02.417
Yeah.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.208
You're a little troupe
of sibling activists.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.125
Where's the parents?

25:09.958 --> 25:10.958
My mom's dead.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.208
Shit. I'm so sorry.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.417
Where'd you get your parents
from anyway? A catalog?

25:21.208 --> 25:22.375
Hey, now.

25:37.583 --> 25:40.000
That's nice.
Really.

25:49.375 --> 25:52.375
I reckon you're drunk enough
to tell me your sad story.

25:55.042 --> 25:57.042
What makes you think
I have a sad story?

25:57.333 --> 25:59.167
You're way too interesting
not to.

26:10.417 --> 26:11.875
So where's your dad?

26:18.208 --> 26:20.458
He's in the state pen.

26:26.542 --> 26:27.917
What's he serving?

26:34.875 --> 26:36.583
He's on H wing.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.250
Sandusky Wood.

26:47.208 --> 26:48.333
H isn't...

26:49.625 --> 26:51.583
the wing that
you want to be on...

26:52.917 --> 26:54.042
if you know what I mean.

26:59.042 --> 27:00.042
Your mom?

27:07.875 --> 27:08.875
When?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Eight years ago.

27:14.500 --> 27:17.875
I came home from a friend's
house and I, uh...

27:23.000 --> 27:24.417
I found her in the living room.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.917
She had been stabbed and, um...

27:33.042 --> 27:35.125
Uh, my dad,
he was supposed to be

27:35.125 --> 27:37.000
across town that night,
but someone...

27:37.583 --> 27:39.417
They saw some guy
that looked like him,

27:39.417 --> 27:42.208
like, a few blocks away,
throw something in a bush.

27:46.542 --> 27:47.542
A weapon?

27:49.208 --> 27:50.083
Yeah.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.542
But, you know, there's, like...
There's holes in the case.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.458
You don't think he did it?

27:58.333 --> 27:59.458
He says he didn't.

28:01.292 --> 28:04.542
I mean, we have this lawyer
and he's got, like, three guys

28:04.542 --> 28:06.250
off death row and...

28:09.125 --> 28:13.542
But we can't afford him,
so Martha's like fucking... Shit!

28:26.333 --> 28:27.375
It's okay.

28:28.542 --> 28:32.375
And we go to all these, like,
stupid fucking protests,

28:32.417 --> 28:35.292
like it's going to make
a fucking difference.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.208
- Hey.
- Hi!

30:43.375 --> 30:44.375
I'm hungover.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.583
I'm sorry. I didn't, uh...

30:48.917 --> 30:51.917
mean for last night
to turn into such a...

30:52.625 --> 30:54.042
counseling session.

30:54.417 --> 30:55.208
It's just...

30:57.167 --> 30:59.417
booze. I should
probably never drink it.

31:04.625 --> 31:06.208
So, are you all right?

31:06.917 --> 31:10.125
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

31:10.417 --> 31:11.583
Okay, 'cause...

31:13.083 --> 31:14.417
we got to go.

31:29.042 --> 31:31.083
I'll be thinking about you,
Lucy Moro.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.292
Lucy.
It's my turn on the laptop.

31:59.667 --> 32:00.917
I'm on it.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.208
What are you doing?

32:06.417 --> 32:08.333
I'm writing
the Great American Novel.

32:09.958 --> 32:11.042
What?

32:13.167 --> 32:15.208
I'm looking at porn, okay?
Go away.

33:05.375 --> 33:07.417
- You look good.
- Yeah?

33:07.958 --> 33:08.875
Yeah.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.083
You look happy.

33:11.583 --> 33:13.208
Did I tell you we were on TV?

33:13.417 --> 33:15.917
- No. Get out of here.
- Yeah.

33:15.917 --> 33:17.417
A news report in Virginia.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.000
And you can see
Ben in the background

33:19.000 --> 33:21.417
with signs and everything.
It's on YouTube.

33:21.917 --> 33:23.583
- YouTube?
- Yeah.

33:25.417 --> 33:28.083
Oh. I brought this.

33:29.125 --> 33:31.167
He's basically
my height already.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.417
Martha was saying

33:33.417 --> 33:35.583
that she thinks there's
a model in the family.

33:35.583 --> 33:39.542
I was assuming it was me,
but I'm beginning to wonder.

33:39.917 --> 33:41.083
He's not giving you any trouble?

33:41.083 --> 33:42.917
No. He's a good kid.

33:45.250 --> 33:48.250
- He'd love to come visit soon.
- Yeah, I know.

33:51.083 --> 33:53.833
You know, it's just
been a while and, uh...

33:54.542 --> 33:56.917
The lawyer was here.

33:57.583 --> 33:59.042
He told me about the witness.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.167
He seems to think
it's good news.

34:03.292 --> 34:04.375
Yeah.

34:06.042 --> 34:08.292
What? You don't think so?

34:09.083 --> 34:10.833
There's got to be
something, right?

34:12.417 --> 34:15.500
I mean, that proves it,
that proves you weren't there.

34:17.125 --> 34:18.833
He's just covering
all the angles.

34:19.333 --> 34:21.417
I just thought you wanted
your name cleared is all.

34:21.417 --> 34:22.583
I wanna get out of here.

34:27.292 --> 34:29.042
Hey. How's the house?

34:31.208 --> 34:32.250
It's okay.

34:32.958 --> 34:34.125
And the garden?

34:34.958 --> 34:35.875
Fine.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.083
Your mother loved that garden.

34:38.583 --> 34:40.833
She could have planted a cherry
tree in the desert.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.250
How about that boiler?
Did you get it checked?

34:44.250 --> 34:45.250
I will.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.458
You wait for it to pack
in, they'll charge you double

34:47.458 --> 34:49.417
because they know
you're desperate.

34:49.417 --> 34:51.000
You've got two girls
living alone...

34:51.000 --> 34:52.625
It's not cheap is the thing.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.250
People take advantage.

34:58.417 --> 35:01.083
In these protests,
there's guys there, right?

35:01.083 --> 35:01.958
Yeah.

35:02.917 --> 35:03.667
'Cause you need to
tell your sister

35:03.667 --> 35:04.667
to hurry up
and meet someone.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.667
'Cause I know
I'm not going to be able to

35:06.667 --> 35:08.417
meet my grandchildren, so...

35:09.625 --> 35:12.417
I want to know that there are
some on the way at least.

35:13.625 --> 35:15.958
Well, I'll tell her to put
herself around more.

35:15.958 --> 35:18.292
That's not what I mean.
And you neither.

35:18.292 --> 35:19.958
You don't have to
worry about me.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.583
Of course I worry.
I'm your father.

35:23.417 --> 35:24.333
Hey.

35:25.208 --> 35:28.208
Small hands...
give me some affection.

35:49.583 --> 35:52.167
- I miss you, darling.
- You too, Dad.

36:36.542 --> 36:38.417
Hey! What are you doing?

37:14.000 --> 37:14.750
Okay.

37:18.083 --> 37:19.000
Fuck!

37:28.583 --> 37:29.958
<i>- Hi!
- Hi.</i>

37:30.208 --> 37:31.542
Hi, hey, hello.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.208
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

37:33.583 --> 37:35.625
I'm sorry. I said that already,
I guess, yeah.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.500
<i>Yeah. A few times.</i>

37:37.500 --> 37:38.500
Hi.

37:40.417 --> 37:42.333
<i>So? What's up?</i>

37:43.375 --> 37:45.917
Um, nothing. Nothing.
I'm just, um...

37:47.458 --> 37:50.167
I...
What's up with you?

37:51.625 --> 37:53.417
<i>Sorry. I hope it's not weird
that I called.</i>

37:53.417 --> 37:56.917
It's super weird.
It's... It's extremely weird.

37:56.917 --> 37:58.583
I...
I think you're...

37:59.417 --> 38:01.083
a freak.

38:01.417 --> 38:03.417
No! It's fine! It's fine!
It's fine!

38:03.667 --> 38:06.917
Um, is that your office, or...

38:07.667 --> 38:10.958
<i>Yeah. It's my boss's,
but he's at lunch, so...</i>

38:11.333 --> 38:13.083
You law types are so fancy.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.458
<i>Yeah. I know, right? With our
sandwiches and everything.</i>

38:17.458 --> 38:19.458
Lucy, I want to use the laptop.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.083
I'm on it.

38:22.292 --> 38:25.125
<i>I'm playing Warcraft!
Everyone's waiting for me.</i>

38:25.125 --> 38:27.583
- You said I could have it.
- Your dumb game can wait, Benny.

38:27.583 --> 38:30.542
It's not dumb! I'm a healer now,
shithead! People need me!

38:31.042 --> 38:32.083
No!

38:43.417 --> 38:44.583
<i>Open the door!</i>

38:46.417 --> 38:47.583
Fucking hell!

38:49.667 --> 38:51.208
<i>I always wanted
a little brother.</i>

38:51.458 --> 38:55.000
Well, send me your address.
I'll FedEx him over.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.583
<i>No, just send yourself.</i>

38:58.458 --> 39:00.292
Right. Yeah, I'll just...

39:01.000 --> 39:04.417
hop in a crate and wait for you
to open it?

39:05.250 --> 39:06.458
<i>Better yet,
I'll get in with you,</i>

39:06.458 --> 39:08.583
<i>we could post ourselves away.</i>

39:09.333 --> 39:11.333
I'll get some stamps?

39:14.458 --> 39:15.833
<i>Where do you want to go?</i>

39:21.250 --> 39:22.583
Well, everywhere, I guess.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.250
<i>Look, I was actually calling
'cause I spoke to my boss.</i>

39:29.917 --> 39:32.000
<i>He's like a proper lawyer,
not like me.</i>

39:32.000 --> 39:32.917
<i>And, um...</i>

39:34.083 --> 39:35.083
<i>I hope this isn't too forward,</i>

39:35.083 --> 39:38.292
<i>but, uh, we work
with this lab in Chicago,</i>

39:38.500 --> 39:41.292
<i>and they have
this new chemical process.</i>

39:41.292 --> 39:43.292
<i>And the technology has
improved so much</i>

39:43.292 --> 39:47.292
<i>that you can sometimes find
new stuff on old evidence.</i>

39:48.167 --> 39:49.125
<i>And they owe us a favor,</i>

39:49.125 --> 39:51.208
<i>so I could put you
in touch with them.</i>

39:52.083 --> 39:53.250
<i>If you wanted.</i>

39:54.375 --> 39:55.292
Wow.

39:57.583 --> 40:00.208
Th... Thank you so much.
I don't know what to say.

40:00.542 --> 40:02.083
<i>You don't have to say anything.</i>

40:03.458 --> 40:04.458
Look at you...

40:05.250 --> 40:06.542
fighting the death penalty.

40:08.958 --> 40:10.250
<i>Only for the innocent ones.</i>

40:14.542 --> 40:16.125
Why aren't we doing Indiana?

40:17.125 --> 40:20.083
Forty-year-old guy shot his
business partner. Who cares?

40:20.083 --> 40:22.042
No. We're going to
Missouri next month.

40:22.042 --> 40:24.917
Fuck yeah! There's that great
barbecue place on the way.

40:26.167 --> 40:27.583
I do love barbecue.

40:33.917 --> 40:35.417
You talk to Weldon
about the tests?

40:35.625 --> 40:37.417
Yeah. He doesn't think
they're a good idea.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.042
- Why?
- I don't know,

40:39.042 --> 40:40.917
he's probably annoyed
somebody else is helping out.

40:40.958 --> 40:42.417
I told him to get them, though.

40:50.292 --> 40:51.375
Should we ask Dad...

40:53.292 --> 40:54.583
if he thinks it's a good idea?

40:54.583 --> 40:56.250
Why wouldn't he think
it's a good idea?

40:57.667 --> 40:58.958
Yeah. I guess...

41:00.125 --> 41:01.500
I guess if something comes up
then that's good, right?

41:01.500 --> 41:02.833
Well, obviously.

41:03.458 --> 41:05.250
Well, Mercy seems
pretty confident

41:05.292 --> 41:08.000
that something could come up,
and she works at a law firm.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.292
Does she work at a law firm?

41:10.917 --> 41:14.083
I don't think I've heard you
mention that before.

41:17.917 --> 41:20.167
So, I guess your boyfriend
will come back again then?

41:20.375 --> 41:21.458
I guess so.

41:24.000 --> 41:26.542
That's good 'cause you like him
so, so much.

41:26.958 --> 41:28.042
Uh-huh.

41:29.333 --> 41:31.083
Dad asked
why you haven't had kids yet.

41:31.292 --> 41:33.125
Because I'm still
looking after his.

41:45.167 --> 41:46.375
How you feeling, dude?

41:47.250 --> 41:48.250
Not good.

41:49.125 --> 41:50.417
Try to get some rest, buddy.

41:57.375 --> 42:00.542
Remember the terms. You gotta
kill him before he bites you.

42:00.542 --> 42:01.958
Doesn't matter
if he's our brother.

42:01.958 --> 42:03.125
Shut up, Lucy.

42:04.375 --> 42:06.042
He can't go to Missouri
like this.

42:06.042 --> 42:08.417
Will you be okay to stay home
and take care of him?

42:08.417 --> 42:10.375
Why do I have to stay? I can go.

42:10.375 --> 42:13.000
You want to go all the way to
Missouri on your own?

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
You've never gone to one of
these by yourself.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.583
- So? I can't start now?
- I know why you want to go.

42:17.583 --> 42:20.083
- It's what Dad wants.
- It is not what Dad wants.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.000
- Martha, come on.
- No! End of the discussion.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.167
You're not going!

42:51.667 --> 42:52.625
Fuck.

42:56.833 --> 42:59.958

42:59.958 --> 43:01.958

43:32.167 --> 43:34.958
Don't kill for me!

43:48.250 --> 43:49.458
It's our duty to win!

43:49.458 --> 43:50.917
It's our duty to win!

43:50.917 --> 43:52.917
We must love
and support one another!

43:52.917 --> 43:54.625
We must love
and support one another.

43:54.625 --> 43:56.500
We have nothing to lose
but our chains!

43:56.500 --> 43:58.208
We have nothing to lose
but our chains!

43:58.208 --> 44:00.125
It is our duty
to fight for our freedom!

44:51.417 --> 44:53.583
I just hitched a ride
with a guy from the group.

44:54.000 --> 44:54.958
My dad had a thing,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.250
and my mom's choir
is singing in competition.

44:58.250 --> 45:00.167
Your mom sings
competitive choir?

45:00.375 --> 45:04.125
Yeah. Mom thinks that God
hasn't created anything

45:04.125 --> 45:06.458
that can't be improved
by a judging panel.

45:13.000 --> 45:15.083
So you must have really wanted
to see this one, huh?

45:17.917 --> 45:18.958
Sure did.

45:28.917 --> 45:30.208
What are you thinking about?

45:31.458 --> 45:32.583
It's stupid.

45:33.083 --> 45:34.542
Well, obviously.

45:37.208 --> 45:38.458
Seriously, what?

45:40.458 --> 45:42.375
I used to go to
the river with my Dad.

45:46.208 --> 45:48.667
You see, he loved fishing,
but Martha and my mom hated it.

45:48.667 --> 45:51.292
So, you know,
I'd end up going on my own.

45:55.083 --> 45:56.625
But then, like,
a few hours later,

45:56.625 --> 45:58.917
they would, like,
show up and be like,

45:58.917 --> 46:01.125
"Oh, we just went for a walk,"
you know?

46:01.458 --> 46:02.458
And then...

46:06.458 --> 46:07.958
Martha and I would end up, like,

46:07.958 --> 46:10.375
playing in the water or whatever
and then we'd...

46:11.375 --> 46:14.208
look and see my dad
and mom kissing.

46:14.208 --> 46:15.833
You know,
and we'd just, like...

46:17.292 --> 46:20.167
scream and freak out,
and they're, like, laughing.

46:23.667 --> 46:26.292
You know, I think
that only happened once.

46:33.667 --> 46:36.542
I think we only went to the
river one single time.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.917
But it feels like more,
you know.

46:45.958 --> 46:47.292
We should probably go, huh?

46:49.333 --> 46:50.958
Yeah, I guess so.

47:11.625 --> 47:13.083
You falling asleep?

47:13.583 --> 47:14.625
No.

47:15.667 --> 47:16.875
Liar.

47:17.667 --> 47:19.292
Yeah.

47:28.417 --> 47:31.833
You can stay, you know.
Like, if you wanted... to.

47:33.125 --> 47:34.375
Like, you could...

47:38.125 --> 47:39.583
I should probably get back.

47:51.083 --> 47:53.167
I met with the victim's mom.
She was...

47:55.125 --> 47:56.250
so broken.

47:57.125 --> 47:58.125
So sad.

48:01.083 --> 48:02.917
How do you ever
come back from that?

48:07.125 --> 48:08.125
Maybe you don't.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.333
You think you ever will?

48:25.083 --> 48:26.917
When Mike's killer was executed,

48:26.917 --> 48:29.500
my parents felt
this massive weight lifted.

48:30.458 --> 48:32.292
Like they could
finally breathe again.

48:36.042 --> 48:37.417
That's what I want for you.

48:44.667 --> 48:46.333
We're not the same, you know?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.542
I know.

48:50.917 --> 48:54.458
I'm sorry your dad's partner got
himself shot, but it was my mom.

48:55.958 --> 48:58.083
That's my fucking dad
that you're talking about.

48:59.083 --> 49:00.542
I'll feel better
if they kill him?

49:00.542 --> 49:01.958
No. That's not what I meant.

49:01.958 --> 49:03.292
I mean, it's so great...

49:04.083 --> 49:06.958
that lethally injecting
a mentally disabled man

49:06.958 --> 49:08.500
is the key
to solving your grief.

49:09.000 --> 49:11.125
But my shit's
a little more complicated.

49:12.250 --> 49:13.833
- Lucy, I...
- Can you go?

49:14.292 --> 49:16.042
- Hold on.
- Can you just go?

49:19.625 --> 49:20.583
Okay.

49:39.083 --> 49:40.125
<i>Lucy?</i>

49:45.208 --> 49:46.417
<i>You in there, honey?</i>

50:14.625 --> 50:15.875
You okay?

50:22.625 --> 50:23.958
He didn't do it.

50:27.583 --> 50:29.958
- I know.
- No, you don't.

50:32.917 --> 50:33.917
You don't know.

50:35.542 --> 50:36.542
No one does.

50:39.583 --> 50:41.125
But I still don't
give you permission

50:41.125 --> 50:42.625
to stick a needle in his arm
and kill him.

50:42.625 --> 50:44.250
I don't fucking give you that!

50:50.667 --> 50:52.000
What are you doing?

50:55.417 --> 50:56.375
I'm driving you home.

51:31.583 --> 51:33.125
How are you going to get home?

51:34.333 --> 51:35.500
Don't worry about it.

51:40.417 --> 51:42.625
You're splitting gas money
though, right?

51:45.625 --> 51:47.125
<i>And he hits it.</i>

51:47.125 --> 51:48.458
<i>Out there at third.</i>

51:48.500 --> 51:50.250
<i>- No.
- Out at second...</i>

51:51.583 --> 51:52.917
Who's your team?

51:53.458 --> 51:55.000
The Schaumburg Boomers.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.250
Were they named by Dr. Seuss?

51:57.250 --> 51:59.125
A boomer is a type of
prairie chicken.

51:59.333 --> 52:02.250
Oh, okay. Well, that's not
ridiculous at all then.

52:02.250 --> 52:05.125
Just be quiet.
Let me listen to this, dude.

52:05.333 --> 52:06.958
<i>So the ball flies...</i>

52:07.292 --> 52:09.833
The Gulfside Prison
for Women in Alabama.

52:10.667 --> 52:12.500
Delmarva Correctional.

52:12.500 --> 52:16.250
Uh, the George Reed Facility.
That's in Delaware.

52:16.500 --> 52:18.333
Uh, Tulsa Penitentiary.

52:18.667 --> 52:21.542
And then the Hunters Creek unit
in Texas.

52:21.542 --> 52:23.875
I've been there a lot obviously.

52:24.583 --> 52:27.292
The South Fork
Branch Facility...

52:27.292 --> 52:29.875
Maybe just list prisons
you haven't been to.

52:31.667 --> 52:32.917
Yeah?

52:34.417 --> 52:36.125
- Grieve?
- No.

52:36.667 --> 52:38.292
- Girder?
- No.

52:38.292 --> 52:39.625
Girls?

52:40.625 --> 52:41.500
I give up.

52:42.500 --> 52:43.250
Well, we have
five hours of driving left,

52:43.250 --> 52:45.375
so I'm confident you'll get it.

52:47.667 --> 52:49.167
- Gas meter!
- No.

52:50.667 --> 52:52.625
- Grit.
- Did you say grass?

52:53.917 --> 52:55.125
- Grit.
- Oh, no.

52:55.667 --> 52:57.500
- Grass.
- No.

53:03.042 --> 53:05.000
Okay, so tell me
about your love life.

53:08.167 --> 53:10.583
Um, well, there was, like,

53:10.583 --> 53:13.250
a brief relationship
back in school. Toby.

53:13.458 --> 53:16.583
- Oh. Sounds nice.
- Yeah, he's okay.

53:17.500 --> 53:20.125
- Still heartbroken.
- Well, naturally.

53:20.167 --> 53:21.292
Yeah, God, no.

53:21.333 --> 53:24.917
I don't know about that,
but we went to prom together...

53:26.583 --> 53:28.000
- ...and it didn't go well.
- What happened?

53:29.458 --> 53:30.667
Not my scene, I guess.

53:30.667 --> 53:33.625
I would love to see you
in a prom dress.

53:34.250 --> 53:35.458
I wore a tuxedo.

53:37.583 --> 53:38.667
Okay.

53:38.667 --> 53:40.917
And then there was another guy.
Gary.

53:41.417 --> 53:43.500
That was a little bit later.

53:44.333 --> 53:45.292
Um, but we only...

53:46.083 --> 53:50.125
That was just, you know,
like, sex, only once.

53:50.125 --> 53:53.542
- And I'm still not sure why.
- Did you like him?

53:53.958 --> 53:56.000
Uh, well,
all the girls liked him.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.333
No, but did you like him?

53:57.667 --> 53:58.583
Uh...

53:59.583 --> 54:01.333
He had a really cool guitar.

54:01.333 --> 54:05.042
And he had a really nice English
Bulldog named Betty.

54:05.042 --> 54:07.333
That is not the
same thing as liking someone.

54:07.333 --> 54:10.167
- Turns out it's not, no.
- Okay, so, Toby, Gary

54:10.167 --> 54:12.667
and the Bull Terrier.
That's your whole love life?

54:12.667 --> 54:14.500
Well, Betty, but...
And, uh...

54:15.292 --> 54:16.458
No, I, um...

54:17.250 --> 54:19.208
There were, like, a few people
here and there.

54:19.417 --> 54:21.042
When was the last time
you were laid?

54:21.500 --> 54:25.625
Oh, my God.
That is none of your business.

54:29.250 --> 54:30.875
Like, two years?

54:31.500 --> 54:34.542
Are... Are you telling me?
Or are you asking a question?

54:35.583 --> 54:36.917
I'm telling you.

54:37.375 --> 54:39.500
- You're stating a fact.
- Yeah.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.167
- Two years!
- What?

54:42.958 --> 54:46.917
Don't yell at me! I haven't had
time for a relationship!

54:46.917 --> 54:50.500
Who is talking about a
relationship? Two years!

54:50.500 --> 54:52.958
- I've been busy!
- Doing what?

54:53.167 --> 54:55.083
You go on a lot of
long bike rides?

54:55.083 --> 54:57.250
I don't even... I don't, come on.
I...

54:58.000 --> 55:01.417
That's enough.
We can stop talking about me.

55:02.292 --> 55:05.542
I'm assuming by your horrified
rant that you sex a lot?

55:05.542 --> 55:06.542
What?

55:07.333 --> 55:09.667
Oh, my God, it's been so long

55:09.667 --> 55:12.958
that you've actually changed the
word to a verb!

55:13.250 --> 55:16.958
Did you sex her?
Do you like to sex each other?

55:17.167 --> 55:19.333
No! No, no.
You're better than this.

55:19.333 --> 55:21.208
- Well, I'm not.
- Well, you should be.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.083
Just fucking drive.

55:32.333 --> 55:33.500
No.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.083
No!

55:36.458 --> 55:38.333
- What?
- This is my song.

55:38.667 --> 55:40.417
This is my song. Pull over!

55:41.292 --> 55:42.500
Pull over! Pull over! Pull over!

55:42.500 --> 55:43.375
Okay.

55:52.208 --> 55:54.042
<i>♪ You got me begging
you for mercy ♪</i>

58:48.417 --> 58:49.875
How old are you here?

58:52.208 --> 58:56.292
- Uh, thirteen.
- Who took the photo?

58:57.333 --> 58:58.250
Uh...

59:00.167 --> 59:02.167
I don't know.
I don't remember that day.

59:09.958 --> 59:11.917
Is this the room that you found
her in?

59:23.167 --> 59:24.917
She was there.

59:29.375 --> 59:31.875
We moved the TV cabinet

59:32.208 --> 59:34.500
because we couldn't get
the bloodstain up.

59:38.208 --> 59:39.583
I guess it's still there, maybe.

59:41.667 --> 59:43.000
You were by yourself?

59:45.042 --> 59:47.333
Well, Ben was in his cot,
screaming.

59:48.167 --> 59:49.500
Martha was at college,

59:49.500 --> 59:52.375
so it took her an hour or so
to drive back.

59:56.125 --> 59:57.917
Were there any defense wounds?

59:58.458 --> 59:59.958
Or any other marks?

01:00:03.125 --> 01:00:04.125
Yeah.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.250
And the doors and the windows?

01:00:09.167 --> 01:00:10.375
Undamaged.

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:14.250
So it wasn't a break in.

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:24.167
No. Whoever it was,
she let them in. Or...

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:25.958
Or they had a key?

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:30.208
Was anything taken?

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.333
Yeah, some jewelry,
but they, uh...

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:37.417
They found it with the knife.

01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:39.917
And the knife was?

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.875
From the kitchen.

01:00:42.667 --> 01:00:44.333
No prints or anything.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:48.000
You want to ask
if she was raped?

01:00:52.375 --> 01:00:54.125
Some people
don't like to ask that.

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:59.292
She wasn't, if that helps
your investigation.

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:01.167
- Sorry, I didn't...
- No. It's fine.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:08.000
There were marks by the door.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.333
Something had happened there.

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:12.458
She hit her head.

01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:15.625
So the doorbell had rung.

01:01:16.958 --> 01:01:18.167
So she opened it.

01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:22.500
Her attacker came in,
knocked her to the ground...

01:01:23.667 --> 01:01:26.000
went inside to find something
to steal.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:31.167
She got up, went to the kitchen.
Maybe grabbed a knife.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:32.917
Followed him in here.

01:01:34.083 --> 01:01:36.542
He grabbed the knife from her,
stabbed her...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.833
ran out and closed the door
behind him.

01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:43.292
Why didn't she run out?

01:01:45.375 --> 01:01:47.625
If she was knocked down by a guy
by the front door,

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:48.625
why didn't she run out

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:50.875
- to try and get help?
- Her baby was upstairs.

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:53.500
Would you leave your baby?

01:01:57.917 --> 01:01:59.125
Well, that's good to know.

01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:01.917
How was Missouri?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Fine.

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:08.417
- And you? You enjoy yourself?
- I don't go there for that.

01:02:08.417 --> 01:02:11.500
- No? You just go there to gloat?
- Martha...

01:02:13.292 --> 01:02:15.375
Ben's still sick
and I have to work.

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.958
Can I trust you to stay here
and take care of him tomorrow?

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.625
Did you believe it?

01:02:40.542 --> 01:02:42.417
What Martha said
about the intruder

01:02:42.417 --> 01:02:44.500
and my mom running back in?

01:02:47.042 --> 01:02:48.208
Do you believe it?

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:16.292
Oh, fuck.

01:04:25.708 --> 01:04:28.958
No, no. No.

01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:35.167
- No.
- I really have to leave.

01:04:35.167 --> 01:04:38.292
No, no, no.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.208
Oh, hi.

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:48.583
Who are you?

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.292
I'm Mercy. I'm Lucy's friend.

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:55.042
Okay.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.500
You must be Benjamin.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:01.083
Do you want anything?

01:05:02.125 --> 01:05:03.917
I just threw up in the hallway.

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:06.292
I'm going back to bed.

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:08.083
Okay.

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:10.083
I'm going to
leave you with that.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:11.083
Thanks.

01:05:11.458 --> 01:05:13.542
Um, I'll see you soon.

01:05:16.917 --> 01:05:18.083
Feel better, Ben!

01:05:35.208 --> 01:05:36.375
Oh, man!

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:46.625
So you'll be in Georgia?

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:49.875
<i>Out in strength.</i>

01:05:50.458 --> 01:05:52.667
You guys are the worst.

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:56.083
<i>Really?
Well, maybe I won't come then.</i>

01:05:56.083 --> 01:05:58.292
No! No! I didn't mean it.

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.583
<i>I got to go.</i>

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:03.417
<i>I've got a hot date</i>

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:07.125
<i>at a reasonably priced Italian
chain restaurant with my boss.</i>

01:06:07.375 --> 01:06:09.458
<i>- Lucky.
- I know, right?</i>

01:06:11.208 --> 01:06:12.958
Wait, where are you going?

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.875
<i>I told you. I got to go get
ready. I'll see you in Georgia.</i>

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:24.542
Oh, come on.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.542
Skip dinner!

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:05.500
Is Martha around?

01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:06.875
She's out.

01:07:09.167 --> 01:07:10.292
Do you know where?

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:13.042
With a guy from work.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:16.458
Is there something you wanted?

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:21.958
Got some news about the case.

01:07:22.458 --> 01:07:23.583
What is it?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.875
- Maybe it can wait.
- I was joking!

01:07:28.542 --> 01:07:30.042
She's out with Ben.

01:07:31.375 --> 01:07:33.375
You're too sensitive.
You know that?

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:43.875
Twenty-two years old.

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:46.375
You're living like
a middle-aged divorcee.

01:07:47.542 --> 01:07:49.125
Well, yeah. You'd know.

01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:57.542
I know she probably
sees other people.

01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:01.583
I can't actually figure out
whether she likes me or not.

01:08:03.292 --> 01:08:04.292
But you,

01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.250
I know you don't like me.
You think I'm the bad guy.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.083
You like your hippie friends.

01:08:12.083 --> 01:08:14.125
How many people have they got
off death row?

01:08:15.375 --> 01:08:16.917
None. Me?

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:20.125
I've saved lives. Three of them.
But I'm the asshole?

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It was Martha
who started whatever this is.

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:28.207
Now, I'm driving three hours
to tell you something

01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:30.542
that could have been done
over a five-minute phone call.

01:08:31.042 --> 01:08:34.082
I'm so sorry this has fucked up
your life so much.

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:40.042
Think she'll still want to see
me when it's over?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.875
It might depend on the outcome.

01:08:54.417 --> 01:08:57.167
I always thought he did it.
Your dad.

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.375
Don't make a difference to me.
Just...

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:02.957
can't help having an opinion,
I guess.

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.417
You come all the way here
just to tell me that?

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.332
I came to tell you
the results of the test

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:10.917
came back from Chicago.

01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.250
One of the hairs they got off
the crime scene

01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:14.542
matched a known criminal.

01:09:15.582 --> 01:09:17.957
Some guy up in Jersey
doing a bit for assault.

01:09:20.125 --> 01:09:21.332
He could be the killer?

01:09:22.417 --> 01:09:24.207
Your father might actually
be the victim

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:26.042
of a miscarriage of justice.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.250
How's that make you feel?

01:09:32.125 --> 01:09:33.375
She's relieved!

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.207
Shame on you.
I thought you were a believer.

01:09:36.207 --> 01:09:37.292
I am.

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:40.042
Well, anyway,
I just came to tell you that.

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:42.582
But I guess Martha's busy, so...

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:46.082
She really doesn't see
other people. She's loyal.

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.917
What happens now?

01:09:50.542 --> 01:09:52.000
If you girls want...

01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.125
I'll go get
some more tests done.

01:09:54.542 --> 01:09:56.708
Take a trip to Jersey,
speak to this son-of-a-bitch

01:09:56.708 --> 01:09:58.167
and see what's what.

01:10:00.042 --> 01:10:02.500
You could actually prove
that he didn't do it?

01:10:16.417 --> 01:10:18.042
Get your sister to call me.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.708

01:10:59.375 --> 01:11:01.208
Remember when the AC worked?

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:04.083
God, I think of those
as the halcyon days.

01:11:05.292 --> 01:11:08.000
Like, you know how your body is
supposed to be 70 percent water?

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.917
I'm pretty sure mine's, like,
70 percent butt crack sweat.

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:13.167
We could have some quiet time
if you want.

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:16.042
No. I want to talk to you some
more about my butt sweat.

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:18.542
Remember when you were
a teenager

01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:20.542
and sometimes you would
get so mad

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:23.125
at me that you wouldn't speak to
me for weeks?

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:27.250
I think of those
as the halcyon days.

01:11:29.125 --> 01:11:32.125
That's a very cruel thing to
say, and I'm ashamed of you.

01:11:51.375 --> 01:11:53.417
Hey! Where are you going?
Limpy? Limpy?

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.000
Crap! That hurts!

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.500
Well, it's going to hurt
a lot more

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.375
when you get an infection,
and I got to cut your leg off.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.250
Well, I'll get a wheelchair.

01:12:59.542 --> 01:13:02.208
No. You'll get a wooden leg,
and they'll call you Limpy,

01:13:02.208 --> 01:13:04.500
- and they'll throw trash at you.
- Shut up.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.292
You sure you just fell over?

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:12.542
Yeah.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:16.417
- No one pushed you?
- No.

01:13:20.042 --> 01:13:22.417
When Dad comes back is he going
to want me to move out?

01:13:24.417 --> 01:13:25.500
No.

01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.375
No, why would you think that?

01:13:28.625 --> 01:13:31.250
Well, 'cause he never
wanted me to visit.

01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:38.958
He just didn't think it was
right, with the prison...

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.875
Well, that's bullshit, ain't it?

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.625
You have nothing to worry about.

01:13:50.625 --> 01:13:51.583
'Cause the only person

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:54.083
that can kick you out
of this house is me.

01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:55.917
You got that? Huh?

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.542
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:14:01.292 --> 01:14:02.208
Ben?

01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:10.042
These are ruined.
Do you have another pair?

01:14:10.667 --> 01:14:12.042
You bought me another pair?

01:14:13.125 --> 01:14:14.250
No.

01:14:14.250 --> 01:14:16.250
Oh, then I don't got
another pair.

01:15:49.542 --> 01:15:50.917
What's he doing here?

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:53.083
I don't know. Just sent me out.

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:37.375
There couldn't be a mistake?

01:16:38.250 --> 01:16:39.250
No mistake.

01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:41.417
They went over it all again,

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:43.917
found a spot of blood
on your father's shirt

01:16:43.917 --> 01:16:45.167
they missed last time.

01:16:47.083 --> 01:16:48.292
It was your mother's.

01:16:50.708 --> 01:16:52.542
What about the guy in Jersey?

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:54.083
Moving guy.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:55.625
Delivered your couch.

01:16:56.833 --> 01:16:59.208
He was in a bar in Tulsa that
night. They got witnesses.

01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:01.083
So these tests are the reason

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.875
that they're going to
kill my dad?

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.625
Stabbing your mother
is the reason

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:07.125
why they're going to kill
your dad.

01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:22.917
At least now we know.

01:17:49.583 --> 01:17:50.583
Hey...

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:06.000
He didn't do it.

01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:10.500
Just because this happened
this doesn't mean anything.

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:13.375
It doesn't prove that he did it.
It doesn't.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.667
- It's exactly what it proves.
- No.

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:19.000
She could have had a nosebleed.
She could have cut her finger.

01:18:26.417 --> 01:18:27.583
I think he killed her.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:29.208
No, don't say that.
Don't say that.

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.042
Listen, tomorrow we are going
to the prison.

01:18:31.042 --> 01:18:32.292
We're going to go.
Me, you and Ben.

01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:33.958
- No.
- And we're going to talk to him.

01:18:33.958 --> 01:18:35.417
- Yes, yes, yes.
- No, no.

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:38.417
- This is our family, Lucy!
- This isn't a family!

01:18:38.417 --> 01:18:41.417
No, no, no, please, Lucy?
Please, do not give up!

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:43.292
Why? Why?

01:18:44.042 --> 01:18:47.125
I've been doing this
since I was 14!

01:18:48.083 --> 01:18:49.542
I was a kid!

01:18:50.250 --> 01:18:53.292
And you told me!
You told me he didn't do it!

01:18:53.292 --> 01:18:56.375
And I believed you.
And you promised me!

01:18:57.042 --> 01:19:01.125
I followed you and I would've
done anything for you,

01:19:01.125 --> 01:19:02.250
and you let me!

01:19:02.583 --> 01:19:07.167
No, Lucy, please?
He's our dad. Please?

01:19:09.417 --> 01:19:12.083
No! No! I'm done!

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:05.250
Can I help you?

01:21:08.125 --> 01:21:09.375
Come and take a seat.

01:21:10.583 --> 01:21:12.958
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Absolutely.

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:22.167
Honey, you look pale.
Are you okay?

01:21:22.167 --> 01:21:23.125
I'm fine.

01:21:23.417 --> 01:21:24.458
Okay.

01:21:28.125 --> 01:21:30.250
Are you one
of Mercy's college friends?

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:32.583
Uh, no, actually, I...

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:35.208
Well,
I know her from the protests.

01:21:35.708 --> 01:21:39.292
- Really. I didn't recognize you.
- She's from the other side.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:40.500
The other side?

01:21:40.708 --> 01:21:42.583
I'm home, guys! I've got...

01:21:44.542 --> 01:21:45.625
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:48.167 --> 01:21:49.292
What are you doing here?

01:21:51.333 --> 01:21:52.500
I'm not really sure.

01:21:52.708 --> 01:21:55.000
Honey, let me help you
with that there.

01:21:57.583 --> 01:22:00.125
Mercy? Aren't you
going to introduce everyone?

01:22:00.125 --> 01:22:01.083
Yeah, um...

01:22:02.333 --> 01:22:06.625
This is my sister, Sandy.
And that's her fiancé, Pete.

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:09.375
And this is Grandma.

01:22:09.583 --> 01:22:14.167
And Mom and Dad.
And this is Ian. He's my boss.

01:22:15.583 --> 01:22:17.292
That's a little formal, Merce.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.208
She's the boss of me at home.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:21.625
God only knows how anything

01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:22.875
gets done in that office.

01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:24.917
Have a seat, Merce.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:29.042
It's nice to meet you all.

01:22:30.708 --> 01:22:33.125
So, Lucy,

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:35.375
uh, what brings you
out this time of night?

01:22:36.042 --> 01:22:37.542
I'm just passing through.

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:40.875
Where are you from?

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:43.625
Ohio.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:46.250
Wow, that's a long way to come.

01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.917
You were in Kentucky.

01:22:54.583 --> 01:22:57.000
You know that guy
killed my partner.

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:01.250
I'm incredibly sorry about that.

01:23:02.917 --> 01:23:03.917
Sure.

01:23:06.125 --> 01:23:10.167
So, you two made friends.
That's nice.

01:23:11.417 --> 01:23:13.375
A tad unusual, but nice.

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.417
Yeah.
Mercy's been really kind to me.

01:23:17.417 --> 01:23:19.333
Hey, can we talk for a second,
Lucy?

01:23:54.458 --> 01:23:55.625
You have a boyfriend?

01:23:59.417 --> 01:24:00.458
That's great.

01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:05.500
And, what? You live with your
parents or something?

01:24:08.167 --> 01:24:09.250
It's temporary.

01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:13.125
Maybe you and Ian
can move in together.

01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:16.958
Why'd you come here?

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.292
Because you're here.

01:24:19.583 --> 01:24:22.125
It's just complicated, isn't it?

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:23.042
Why?

01:24:24.208 --> 01:24:25.125
You know why.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.042
Because you're not
some fucking dyke?

01:24:27.042 --> 01:24:29.375
- This is my life, Lucy.
- No, it's not!

01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:32.583
- This isn't you!
- How do you know that?

01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:35.583
You spent a couple of days
with me in the year?

01:24:35.583 --> 01:24:37.917
But this is who I am
the rest of the time.

01:24:37.917 --> 01:24:40.125
Well, who you are the rest of
the time fucking sucks.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.375
I just met you.
I wasn't planning on...

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.333
I'm just trying to go through it
on my own time, okay?

01:24:51.333 --> 01:24:53.250
You don't get to
choose that for me.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:24:58.042
Tell your lawyer boyfriend

01:24:58.042 --> 01:25:00.208
that his advice
fucking sucks by the way.

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:14.250
Thanks.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.333
You did everything you could.

01:26:25.125 --> 01:26:26.417
You can appeal it again.

01:26:26.417 --> 01:26:28.208
- No.
- We can get more tests.

01:26:29.167 --> 01:26:31.000
Ain't no tests
going to change that.

01:26:32.542 --> 01:26:34.458
- These guys made their minds up.
- No.

01:26:34.458 --> 01:26:37.000
No. No. We can try.

01:26:38.167 --> 01:26:39.417
We can fight it.

01:26:41.458 --> 01:26:43.375
You're a smart girl, Martha.

01:26:44.625 --> 01:26:46.125
Always have been.

01:26:49.125 --> 01:26:51.208
I thought you'd do amazing
things with your life.

01:26:51.625 --> 01:26:53.125
'cause you're so smart.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:59.958
That lawyer seemed so sure that
he could get me off this thing.

01:27:02.125 --> 01:27:05.042
Save my worthless life.

01:27:08.542 --> 01:27:10.125
Give me another chance with you.

01:27:14.542 --> 01:27:16.958
- You need to hear this.
- No, don't say it.

01:27:17.292 --> 01:27:19.875
You need to hear this, Martha.
You need to hear it.

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:21.375
- I need to say it.
- Don't!

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:46.958
- Do you know what a boomer is?
- No.

01:27:47.667 --> 01:27:49.333
It's a type of prairie chicken.

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:52.875
- That's good to know.
- I think so.

01:27:55.708 --> 01:27:57.417
There's a baseball team
named after them,

01:27:57.417 --> 01:27:59.292
and they're my least
favorite team.

01:28:03.458 --> 01:28:05.542
My least favorite team
is the Miami Dolphins.

01:28:06.167 --> 01:28:07.167
Why?

01:28:08.125 --> 01:28:09.625
Because how could a dolphin
play football?

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.125
Great point.

01:28:13.458 --> 01:28:15.417
- You should write them.
- I will.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:19.708
And the Broncos
and the Seahawks and, well,

01:28:19.708 --> 01:28:21.208
pretty much everyone else.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:25.125
- A Bronco could kick a football.
- True, yeah.

01:28:25.458 --> 01:28:27.042
Yeah,
we should leave them out of it.

01:28:38.542 --> 01:28:39.625
Come on.

01:28:40.958 --> 01:28:42.958
- Why?
- Go get Ben.

01:28:48.292 --> 01:28:49.458
So where you want to go?

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.958
- What do you mean?
- Where do you want to live?

01:28:53.167 --> 01:28:54.167
We're moving.

01:28:56.458 --> 01:28:58.083
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:28:58.292 --> 01:29:00.958
We're going. We can go anywhere
we want to go.

01:29:00.958 --> 01:29:03.083
Nothing's stopping us.
Just our imaginations.

01:29:17.958 --> 01:29:20.542
- Somewhere by the sea.
- Somewhere by the sea. Okay.

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:24.167
East coast? West coast?
Gulf coast?

01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:25.667
West coast.

01:29:25.667 --> 01:29:27.500
- West coast.
- West coast.

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:31.458
We've got California. Oregon.
Washington.

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:34.625
- California!
- California!

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:37.958
California! Okay.
California it is!

01:29:38.958 --> 01:29:40.375
- Okay?
- Okay!

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.375
- Okay?
- Okay!

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:43.708
- Okay?
- Okay!

01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:45.208
- Okay!
- Okay!

01:29:51.458 --> 01:29:53.208
Okay, buddy. Just a little bit.

01:29:55.125 --> 01:29:56.375
To California!

01:29:56.375 --> 01:29:57.542
- California!
- California!

01:31:31.958 --> 01:31:32.917
Hey.

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:41.458
I just wanted to be here
for you.

01:31:51.958 --> 01:31:53.250
Well, let's go in then.

01:36:07.958 --> 01:36:12.000
I love you. I fucking love you.
You know that, right?

01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.500
Was he scared?

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:18.500
Yeah.

01:36:21.583 --> 01:36:24.625
Did he say anything about me?

01:36:27.375 --> 01:36:28.542
He said he was sorry.

01:36:33.458 --> 01:36:35.500
I would have told him
it was okay.

01:36:40.083 --> 01:36:41.083
Thank you.

01:36:45.583 --> 01:36:46.958
I'm going to take you home.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:53.167
See you on the bus, okay?

01:37:00.417 --> 01:37:01.542
Oh, my God.

01:37:05.458 --> 01:37:07.083
Thank you for coming today.

01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:10.167
I'm so sorry.

01:38:45.542 --> 01:38:46.917
So how'd you find me?

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.292
Hired a private investigator.

01:38:52.167 --> 01:38:53.042
Smart.

01:38:54.625 --> 01:38:56.542
Told him to look for
a small Ohian.

01:38:57.667 --> 01:38:59.500
It's Ohioan, actually.

01:39:11.542 --> 01:39:12.542
I quit my job.

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.292
And I broke up with Ian.

01:39:22.375 --> 01:39:24.167
Did you tell your mom
where you were going?

01:39:25.333 --> 01:39:26.292
Yeah.

01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:29.333
What'd she say?

01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:32.542
She said, "I'll be here
when you get back."

01:39:36.333 --> 01:39:38.125
That's not a bad thing
to say to someone.

01:39:40.083 --> 01:39:41.083
I guess it isn't.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.208
How is Martha? And Ben?

01:39:49.167 --> 01:39:50.167
Good. Yeah.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:53.250
Yeah, everyone's fine.

01:39:57.167 --> 01:39:58.250
And you?

01:40:02.667 --> 01:40:04.000
I can't.

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:08.917
It's a normal fucking day
and you just show up?

01:40:11.667 --> 01:40:13.583
Lu? You okay?

01:40:14.208 --> 01:40:16.250
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Just, like, five minutes?

01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:17.292
No problem.

01:40:17.958 --> 01:40:19.375
I'm taking lunch orders.

01:40:20.125 --> 01:40:21.333
You want your
veggie burger again?

01:40:21.333 --> 01:40:22.208
Yeah, thanks.

01:40:23.167 --> 01:40:24.167
- Pickles, relish and everything?
- Sounds great.

01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:26.583
Don't rush.

01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:38.167
I am so sorry.

01:40:46.292 --> 01:40:48.000
I got to get back. Sorry.

01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:32.417
I just don't think
you can come back

01:41:32.417 --> 01:41:33.625
into someone's life like this.

01:41:41.667 --> 01:41:43.625
I'm going to stick around
for a few more days.

01:41:43.625 --> 01:41:45.417
So you don't have to see me,
but...

01:41:46.958 --> 01:41:47.958
I'll be here.

01:42:03.292 --> 01:42:04.500
I get off at six.

01:42:07.333 --> 01:42:09.958
If you want to get out of here?
Do something?

01:42:11.292 --> 01:42:13.292
Yeah, yeah, that would be nice.

01:42:15.083 --> 01:42:16.292
Where do you want to go?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.167
I don't know.

01:42:22.458 --> 01:42:23.917
Everywhere, I guess.
