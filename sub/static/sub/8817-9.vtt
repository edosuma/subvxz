WEBVTT

00:07.550 --> 00:10.053
Previously on "Billions"...

00:10.053 --> 00:11.971
I told Donnie we've always
known we can trust him.

00:11.971 --> 00:14.140
Get started with 200,000 shares
of Rubinex.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.559
So we've been profiling
all the players,

00:16.559 --> 00:18.519
and we see this Donnie Caan.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.480
Suddenly, he loads up
on Rubinex.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.941
He couldn't provide
the research on the trade.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.985
He agreed to cooperate
right away.

00:25.985 --> 00:28.779
When Axe takes a big position
on Kemlot, long,

00:28.779 --> 00:31.199
that audit is going to be
a key piece of evidence

00:31.199 --> 00:32.908
proving he went
against the numbers

00:32.908 --> 00:34.743
because he knew something.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.204
I'm not gonna be part
of the case going forward.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.831
I've recused myself.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.208
I want you to keep me
in the loop about

00:40.208 --> 00:42.751
-what you're doing.
-But you're recusing yourself.

00:42.751 --> 00:46.505
The gloves are off.
We do whatever it takes.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.216
I came across a job that I think
might be your Shangri-La.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.968
I know it's yours
if you're interested.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.846
Now the Axelrod name
will be forever affixed

00:53.846 --> 00:56.140
to this building for all time.

00:56.140 --> 00:59.102
Axe is a folk hero
in this town.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.060
[Chuck] The guy gave

01:00.060 --> 01:01.645
the New York City
Firefighter's Foundation

01:01.645 --> 01:03.689
100 million dollars
last year.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.524
The police gave him a plaque
at Ground Zero

01:05.524 --> 01:06.901
with his goddamn name
on it.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.944
You just need to read
this thing I found.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.238
It'll make your day.

01:10.238 --> 01:12.240
-Who should we give it to?
-Dimonda.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.116
September 11, 2001 --

01:14.116 --> 01:16.202
a plane crashes into
the North Tower.

01:16.202 --> 01:18.996
You short aviation stocks
in the European markets

01:18.996 --> 01:21.123
making hundreds of millions
of dollars.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.791
And you take that money,

01:22.791 --> 01:24.210
and you call it Axe Capital.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.544
Taking on the Police Fund
as a client

01:25.544 --> 01:27.129
was one of the proudest
moments of my life.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.632
Last thing I wanna do
is pull the money, but I will.

01:29.632 --> 01:32.384
-When do we give them Kemlot?
-Soon.

[door squeaks]

01:53.197 --> 01:55.824
Okay, best baseball team,
all-time?

01:55.824 --> 01:56.909
'27 Yankees?

01:56.909 --> 01:59.370
Justify it.
Why were they the best?

01:59.370 --> 02:01.622
-Murder's Row.
-Murderer's.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.123
And that's not an argument,
Dean.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.627
I know. Gehrig hit .373.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.712
Hey. Kids, you wanna get
some ice cream?

02:08.712 --> 02:10.464
-[Gordon and Dean] Yeah.
-School night?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.467
Yeah. Let's get some anyway.
Run in. We'll see you in there.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.927
Okay.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.012
â™ª tense music â™ª

02:17.012 --> 02:18.180
[bus hydraulics hiss]

02:18.180 --> 02:19.598
Will you catch up
with the kids?

02:19.598 --> 02:22.893
I'll call George to bring
the Range Rover around.

02:22.893 --> 02:24.895
[door opens]
-It's getting worse.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.233
Yep. It's just starting.

02:28.233 --> 02:31.277
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:37.908 --> 02:41.120
[crickets chirping]

02:41.120 --> 02:43.789
[ball clacks, thuds]

02:49.837 --> 02:53.341
Three ball, side pocket.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.551
[ball clacks, thuds]

02:55.551 --> 02:57.928
When you're alone,
do you always call 'em out loud?

02:57.928 --> 03:01.266
No. Just in my head.

03:01.266 --> 03:03.851
But I keep myself honest.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.853
Only counts if it goes
where I tell it to.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.771
How many?

03:07.771 --> 03:08.939
Forty-two in a row.

03:08.939 --> 03:12.234
Fifth rack almost dead.
Haven't missed yet.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.903
You don't usually even think
about missing.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.363
Don't read anything into it.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.491
[sets down cue]

03:19.491 --> 03:21.702
Kids asleep?

03:21.702 --> 03:24.496
Yeah.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.957
I'm glad you saw it
and reacted the way you did.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.293
Hey, give yourself credit.

03:29.293 --> 03:32.338
You got with it
pretty quick.

03:32.338 --> 03:33.631
We protected them.

03:33.631 --> 03:36.967
Yep. Haven't missed yet.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.427
I told you
not to read into it.

03:38.427 --> 03:40.054
My job is to read
into everything

03:40.054 --> 03:41.263
when it comes
to you and them.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.057
[exhales]

03:43.057 --> 03:45.309
That was
really, really scary.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.354
And I don't scare.

03:48.354 --> 03:50.773
There's hatred.
I can feel it.

03:50.773 --> 03:52.316
I know.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.527
Maybe we should think
about moving away,

03:55.527 --> 03:57.696
just for a while,
somewhere far away from here.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.574
No. No way.

04:00.574 --> 04:04.036
No one is chasing us
from our home or my work.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.621
â™ª pensive music â™ª

04:05.621 --> 04:07.414

Towers down, profits up!
Towers down, profits up!

04:26.684 --> 04:28.811
[man] Axe Capital is profiting

04:28.811 --> 04:31.313
from the deaths of 9/11!

04:31.313 --> 04:34.316
[crowd continues chanting]

[indistinct conversations]

04:39.697 --> 04:40.948
[door closes]

04:40.948 --> 04:42.325
I'm surprised you let
those protesters out there

04:42.325 --> 04:43.493
beat you to it, Sean.

04:43.493 --> 04:46.245
Huh. So you've been
expecting me?

04:46.245 --> 04:47.538
-[Sean] Good.
-Yep.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.207
The vultures and the hyenas
always share the carcass meal.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.710
[chuckles]

04:54.462 --> 04:56.381
[sighs]

04:56.381 --> 04:59.384
As you know,
I'm not just a fund-raiser

04:59.384 --> 05:01.135
for the symphony hall
and the grounds.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.762
I am also a custodian

05:03.762 --> 05:06.306
of the legacy of the arts...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.475
which requires some
difficult conversations.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.939
Since the Yuletide season
is down the road,

05:13.939 --> 05:18.193
I couldn't help thinking about
the real life Saint Nicholas.

05:18.193 --> 05:21.489
That's Nikolaos, the fourth
century bishop of Myra

05:21.489 --> 05:25.909
who was famed
for his anonymous donations

05:25.909 --> 05:28.746
to the poor children,
sailors.

05:28.746 --> 05:30.622
If he was anonymous,
how do you know he did it?

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
[chuckles]

05:33.459 --> 05:35.252
We need to rename
the building.

05:35.252 --> 05:39.424
Sure. That's 100 mil
at 3.3% for three months,

05:39.424 --> 05:42.509
which makes 100,825,000 dollars
you pay me back,

05:42.509 --> 05:44.428
and we part as friends.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.680
And hey, I won't even
charge you any interest

05:46.680 --> 05:48.515
on what I paid
the Eads family.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.601
That's comped.

05:50.601 --> 05:55.398
We're not in a position
to give the money back.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.399
So...

05:57.399 --> 06:00.652
A name change to...

06:00.652 --> 06:05.282
Freedom Hall
or Enterprise Hall.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.701
Majestic titles that would
bespeak a general --

06:07.701 --> 06:09.495
Oh, yeah, I know.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.458
Yeah.

06:13.458 --> 06:14.958
[clicks teeth]

06:14.958 --> 06:16.460
Keep going down this road,

06:16.460 --> 06:19.379
and my lawyers won't stop
until I own the goddamn place.

06:19.379 --> 06:23.175
So it's either Axelrod Hall
or Go Fuck Yourself Hall.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.176
You choose.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.351
[door opens]

06:32.351 --> 06:34.394
[indistinct conversations
in distance]

06:34.394 --> 06:35.813
[door closes]

06:37.606 --> 06:40.234
And the sad thing is,
it's so competitive now.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.236
Half the Chinese are
applying to the Ivies.

06:42.236 --> 06:44.863
All our kids are gonna end up
in second-tier schools.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.032
Not Eva.
She's going to Yale.

06:47.032 --> 06:49.159
-Like I said...
-[laughs]

06:49.159 --> 06:51.370
Oh, you fucking Harvard guys.

06:51.370 --> 06:52.913
[laughs]

06:52.913 --> 06:55.541
You sure? Nothing for you?

06:55.541 --> 06:57.084
Not hydrating today.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.502
[lowered voice]
So I'm thrilled

06:58.502 --> 07:00.504
you got someone
on the inside at Axe Cap.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.006
[dishes clink]

07:03.006 --> 07:05.050
Who looped you in?

07:05.050 --> 07:06.594
I'm tracking so many
of these things,

07:06.594 --> 07:07.886
I don't even notice
who's briefing me.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.638
Just the bars on the uni's,
you know?

07:09.638 --> 07:11.056
â™ª mid-tempo song playing
over speakers â™ª

07:11.056 --> 07:13.225
Anyway, it's all good, man.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.728
This 9/11 shit --
God smiled down on you.

07:16.728 --> 07:17.980
Axelrod magically became

07:17.980 --> 07:20.274
the poster child
for Wall Street malfeasance

07:20.274 --> 07:22.818
and  profiteering off
terrorism.

07:22.818 --> 07:25.654
Or maybe not so magically.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.072
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

07:27.072 --> 07:28.615
In any case,

07:28.615 --> 07:32.077
a big takedown makes
all of Justice look good.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.580
And that's what
you care about, huh?

07:34.580 --> 07:35.747
Don't kid yourself, Chaz.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.667
Perception has to be managed
for the good of the country.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.836
Yeah, I employed the phrase,
and I meant it.

07:40.836 --> 07:42.547
Optics matter.

07:42.547 --> 07:44.715
None of us -- not the AG,
not you, not me --

07:44.715 --> 07:46.551
none of us took down
a single fucking giant

07:46.551 --> 07:47.801
in the shadow
of the crash of '08.

07:47.801 --> 07:51.179
I mean, maybe one or two
mortgage brokers got kneecapped.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.850
Axelrod's the chance
to cement shoe a big one,

07:54.850 --> 07:56.059
for all  of us.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.395
Well, I can't really think
about any of that

07:58.395 --> 08:01.481
because as you damn well know,
I've recused myself.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.027
Yeah. Like you said.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.904
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

08:06.904 --> 08:09.699
All eyes are on you, Chuck.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.283
Land it safely.

08:11.283 --> 08:14.036
We will get you
any  resources you need.

08:14.036 --> 08:15.705
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

08:15.705 --> 08:16.705
Thank you.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.708
Maybe the Attorney General
will grace you

08:18.708 --> 08:21.043
with a presence on the podium,
class the thing up.

08:21.043 --> 08:24.546
[scoffs]

08:24.546 --> 08:28.508
When the jungle was thick,
you hid in the hills.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.676
And now that
I've bushwhacked through

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
and I have El Dorado
in my sights,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.556
you wanna sack the city
with me?

08:33.556 --> 08:36.558
"With me"?

08:36.558 --> 08:38.769
Huh.

08:38.769 --> 08:40.730
I thought
you recused yourself.

This is bad.

Hey, I don't show up at your job
screaming and waving signs

08:55.369 --> 08:57.287
about how much you suck.
-[crowd] Hey, ho! must go!

08:57.287 --> 08:59.665
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You don't have fucking jobs!

-[man] Fuck you!

-I wouldn't throw gas on it.

09:04.127 --> 09:06.631
Yeah, I would.
We're different.

09:06.631 --> 09:08.632
You probably also
make your bed every day.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.050
He wants to see you
in four minutes.

-Don't throw gas on it.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.682
-I'd never.
-[crowd] ...must go! Hey, ho...

09:16.682 --> 09:18.643
Call Bryan Connerty
right now.

09:18.643 --> 09:19.768
Tell him Donnie's about
to meet with Axe.

Are you sure?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.174
I'm not uncertain.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.343
Mind if I ask
why you're certain?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.636
Let's go
for a little walk.

09:54.636 --> 09:58.181

[door closes,

10:12.654 --> 10:14.656
Wait. What happened?

10:14.656 --> 10:16.825
-Fuck!
-[Bryan sighs]

10:16.825 --> 10:18.452
Get a tech in here.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.288
I don't know how
you do it, man.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.331
I appreciate it.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.042
[Bobby] You gotta learn
to trust me, Donnie.

10:25.042 --> 10:26.669
Audio's kicking back in.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.588
Okay. Let's get it done.

â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

11:06.249 --> 11:08.627
You have  lost weight.
I can see it.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.546
Uh, the benefit
of an all-stress diet.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.759
You're all bearing the burden
of his actions.

11:14.759 --> 11:18.136
It's really...
this new level I'm at.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.138
[whispers]
It's so much money.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.474
It's just capital.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.768
That's how you have to
think about it.

11:23.768 --> 11:24.976
Like professional
poker players.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.394
Once the cash has turned
into chips, that's all it is.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.647
Ammo. Bullets in the clip.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.399
Discharge 'em when the target
presents. You know that.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.737
I'm haunted by this image.

11:34.737 --> 11:37.030
It keeps coming
into my head.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.868
Train tracks.
I've fallen on them.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.453
I'm tied up in a web
or something.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.790
There's this knife that I can
reach to cut myself free.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.709
The engine is bearing down,
but I...

11:49.709 --> 11:52.712
For some reason,
my hands won't work.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.172
I can't make them
use the knife

11:54.172 --> 11:56.133
until the damn thing
is going to crush me,

11:56.133 --> 11:58.718
and I'll never see
my kids again.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.180
-You feel trapped.
-[breathes unevenly]

12:02.180 --> 12:04.808
You refuse
to save yourself

12:04.808 --> 12:06.143
because you think

12:06.143 --> 12:07.602
you deserve
whatever's coming,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.814
but...you don't.

12:09.814 --> 12:13.358
Thank you for saying that,
but I do.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.485
It's too late.
I've lied to people.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.781
I've lived my whole life
trying to tell the truth,

12:18.781 --> 12:20.407
and I've been
lying every day.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.784
Who are you lying to?

12:21.784 --> 12:24.369
This business makes liars
out of all of us eventually.

12:24.369 --> 12:27.122
Donnie, I know you
to be a good person.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.958
You can talk to me
as you always have.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.965
Thanks, but we both know
who you answer to.

12:36.965 --> 12:40.010
There is a Chinese Wall
between me and my husband.

12:40.010 --> 12:43.138
[Donnie] That's not
who I'm talking about.

12:43.138 --> 12:44.849
[static]

12:44.849 --> 12:46.183
[whispers] I can't.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.187
[normal voice] I gotta go.

12:53.148 --> 12:55.692
Shit. He's folding on us.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.737
No. It's the last gasp of
conscience. He's gonna do it.

13:12.792 --> 13:17.422
Kemlot. I just placed an order
for 1.8 million shares.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.008
Kaboom!

13:19.008 --> 13:20.967
There's another 800,000 shares
on this ticket.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.302
Can you get 'em in for me?

13:22.302 --> 13:23.720
You know I will.
Give me some ups.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.723
Thanks.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.309
He did it.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.019
He fucking did it.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.646
We need to source
the information.

13:32.646 --> 13:33.939
[Terri] Yeah, we need the part
that dropped out.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.106
-[Bryan] Yeah.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.109
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

13:45.951 --> 13:49.329
[telephone rings in distance]

13:49.329 --> 13:50.956
He was definitely recording.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.083
The data flow itself
is uninterrupted.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.503
My bet is that Axelrod
built an enclosure

13:56.503 --> 13:58.505
that blocks
external electric fields,

13:58.505 --> 14:01.258
making electronic surveillance
impossible.
-[sighs]

14:01.258 --> 14:02.717
It's really smart, actually,
if you think about --

14:02.717 --> 14:05.845
Just clean up the audio file
best you can.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.013
Donnie wasn't right.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.224
I think he's got the yips
or something.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.475
We need to make sure
he's not crashing.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.643
-We'll go scoop him up.

14:20.069 --> 14:21.945
[door creaks]

14:21.945 --> 14:23.947
DeGiulio knows about
our informant.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.740
Of course he does.
I told him.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.284
Why the fuck did you --

14:27.284 --> 14:29.244
I-I-I heard from some guys
in his office

14:29.244 --> 14:31.997
that he was still considering
pulling the thing from us.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.957
He was wondering about
our ability to close.

14:33.957 --> 14:37.419
So I let it leak that we were
closer than anyone knew.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.754
Nice kikashi.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.756
How the fuck do you know
what a kikashi  --

14:41.756 --> 14:44.551
You don't have to live in Asia
to play a little Go.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.344
Okay.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.929
Okay, this we can work with.

14:47.929 --> 14:50.849
The AG wants to be on
that podium in the worst way.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.101
We won't let her,

14:52.101 --> 14:54.352
but we can use her enthusiasm
at the right time.

14:54.352 --> 14:58.023
Here's what I didn't tell 'em --
we just had a breakthrough.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.609
Donnie made a substantial move
based on inside information.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.738
Direct ties to Axelrod.
I'm waiting on details.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.991
Excellent. Finally.

15:06.991 --> 15:08.033
-I got some news.
[door creaks]

15:08.033 --> 15:09.868
Judge on the "Dollar" Bill case
is going to be

-...Whit fucking Wilcox.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.207

the ground for the trial.

Great. [sighs]

-Sean.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.149
Because you need it.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.069
I got this.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.612
Yeah, we knew
you were gonna say that.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.155
You always just wanna
handle it on your own.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.658
But this isn't just about you.
This is about Dean.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.578
What would he think? What would
he say if he'd made it through?

15:53.578 --> 15:56.498
If you think I would do
anything,

15:56.498 --> 16:00.502
anything  to tarnish
our brother's memory...

16:00.502 --> 16:03.671
Bobby and I made it a point
to do the opposite.

to the fire department,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.967

Oh, yeah? Who's talking

Look, Lar,
we just want to make a plan.

Walk away from the shame.
Divorce his ass.

There's no prenup
so you'll be rich,

that blood money.

Mm.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.364
I have an extra.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.076
Sure. I'll have half.
Have you seen Donnie Caan?

earlier.

He say anything about

-No.
-So why are you so worried?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.738
Well, I can't break
confidentiality,

19:15.738 --> 19:18.575

have to write you up.

Faulty.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.415
Really? Is this the way
it's gonna go down?

20:07.415 --> 20:08.875
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

20:08.875 --> 20:10.168
[water hissing]

20:10.168 --> 20:11.461
Good-looking meat.

20:11.461 --> 20:14.381
-[Lu mutters]
-A damn shame.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.966
We are clearing this restaurant
for violations

20:16.966 --> 20:18.718
of fire safety code.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.178
Everybody out.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.512
Let's go! Everybody out!

[patrons murmuring]

20:30.521 --> 20:33.858
[dramatic music plays]

20:33.858 --> 20:36.402
They turned down the coffee
and the doughnuts outside.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.447
Said they don't want
your poison.

20:38.447 --> 20:41.574
Mm. As predictable
as they are annoying.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.743
It's private property.
We could throw them off.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.703
Call in the strike breakers.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.372
No.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.123
Let 'em do their thing.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.418
[door opens]

20:52.418 --> 20:54.379
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:54.379 --> 20:55.505
[indistinct conversations
in distance]

20:55.505 --> 20:57.548
I told you I'd get to you
when we had him in hand.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.343
We're good, Mauricio.
Thank you.

21:00.344 --> 21:01.345
[door closes]

21:01.345 --> 21:02.637
You still haven't
found him?

21:02.637 --> 21:04.347
Like I said, we will.

21:04.347 --> 21:07.016
I just...want to know
what's up.

21:08.310 --> 21:11.104
You sure it's you that
wants to know?

21:12.772 --> 21:15.441
I've just been noticing this
thing this last little while.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.694
Your boss's body language
isn't matching his words.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.237
Fuck is that
supposed to mean?

21:19.237 --> 21:20.321
There's a lack of synthesis

21:20.321 --> 21:21.989
between what Chuck
is saying and presenting

21:21.989 --> 21:23.574
and what's inside of him.

21:23.574 --> 21:25.410
Okay.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.452
That's the kind of thing

21:26.452 --> 21:28.287
that can come back
and bite you in the ass.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.289
What's next? Phrenology?

21:32.250 --> 21:33.543
[chuckles] Hmm.

21:33.543 --> 21:37.004
I'm just trying
to look out for you.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.507
You should check
your own body language

21:38.507 --> 21:40.049
while you're at it.

21:41.676 --> 21:44.429
-I'll get a full-length mirror.
-Well, if you did,

21:44.429 --> 21:46.264
you'd see who you lean into
every time she comes by.

21:46.264 --> 21:48.808
Whoa. Whoa. If this thing
between us is gonna...

21:48.808 --> 21:50.059
Nah. It's done.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.310
It was
a hell of a lot of fun,

21:51.310 --> 21:52.979
but it's run its course,
hasn't it?

21:54.939 --> 21:58.025
Sure. Good call.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.071
Uh, let me know when you've
recovered the witness?

22:02.071 --> 22:04.031
You know, you are
a nice guy, Bryan,

22:04.031 --> 22:07.243
but you'll do a hell of a lot
better when you're your own man.

[Carly] Get everything
you might possibly need

22:18.588 --> 22:20.381
because they will destroy
anything left behind.

22:20.381 --> 22:21.966
Kinda it feels like
jumping ship

22:21.966 --> 22:23.843
at exactly the moment
the ship is gonna sink.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.470
That is the time to do it.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.764
I guess, but I kind of feel bad
for all those other people

22:27.764 --> 22:30.683
who are gonna drown.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.019
If we're doing this together,
do me a favor?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.312
Stop feeling.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.433
You should try it.

23:12.433 --> 23:16.562
Yeah. I've never seen
a 65-year-old look so fresh.

23:16.562 --> 23:19.315
[inhales deeply]
What do you know?

23:21.192 --> 23:23.487
-They're gone for sure.
[door opens]

23:23.487 --> 23:26.322
Channing, Carly,
and fucking  Hlasa.

23:26.322 --> 23:28.366
They grabbed
a few analysts, too.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.619
-[Wags] Security...
[touchscreen clicks]

23:30.619 --> 23:31.661
...pulled this.

23:31.661 --> 23:34.581
[inhales and exhales deeply]

23:34.581 --> 23:35.873
They'll start
their capital raise soon,

23:35.873 --> 23:39.544
-...if they haven't already.
-Meetings are being set.

23:39.544 --> 23:40.670
-[exhales]
-I've gotten a few calls

23:40.670 --> 23:42.505
from folks poking around,

23:42.505 --> 23:45.550
see how pissed we'd be
if they kicked in.

23:45.550 --> 23:49.095
I brought this on, Wags,
15 years ago.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.388
All of it.

23:50.388 --> 23:53.057
I might as well have spoken
a fucking incantation.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.478
If you feel that way,
what do you want me to do?

23:56.478 --> 23:59.146
Keep listening.
Find out what they're up to.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.606
Then I'm gonna
fucking hobble them.

24:00.606 --> 24:04.026
-Like in Misery.
-Hm.

24:04.026 --> 24:05.069
[door creaks]

24:05.069 --> 24:07.822
Hello, Whit.
Thank you for seeing me.

24:07.822 --> 24:09.740
-Oh, no. I'm honored.
[door closes]

24:09.740 --> 24:11.033
It's an uncommon day

24:11.033 --> 24:13.870
when the U.S. Attorney himself
comes by. Sit down.

24:13.870 --> 24:15.413
You know, I just, uh,

24:15.413 --> 24:18.625
wanted to throw a few blades
of grass in the air,

24:18.625 --> 24:20.669
see what kind of environment
my office can expect

24:20.669 --> 24:23.087
on "Dollar" Bill Stern's
pre-trial hearing.

24:23.087 --> 24:24.714
We are not having
this conversation.

24:24.714 --> 24:25.923
We never would.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.467
You know well the environment
of my courtroom.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.595
-Tough, but fair.
-Always.

24:30.595 --> 24:33.097
Fair as in
fair market, too.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.766
Both sides
have to toe the line.

24:35.766 --> 24:38.019
If I find an illegal benefit
was had,

24:38.019 --> 24:39.729
I will steer a jury there.

24:39.729 --> 24:41.981
But if it's
a personal relationship

24:41.981 --> 24:43.357
separate of business,

24:43.357 --> 24:45.818
I'll drive sympathies
the other way.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.654
Tough, but fair.

24:47.654 --> 24:48.905
-Good.
[palm slaps leg]

24:48.905 --> 24:51.908
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

24:53.034 --> 24:55.620
You know, I'm not, uh,
really hands-on,

24:55.620 --> 24:58.831
but...while I'm here,

24:58.831 --> 25:02.209
I wonder if we
re-presented a warrant

25:02.209 --> 25:03.794
for bugging
the Axelrod home.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.046
-No.
[glasses thud]

25:05.046 --> 25:06.213
Asked and answered.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.216
He uses the home
to conduct business.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.344
It's the locust
of a criminal conspiracy.

25:11.344 --> 25:14.388
Should we bug the other
employees' homes, too?

25:14.388 --> 25:16.140
That would include your home,
wouldn't it?

25:17.600 --> 25:19.644
The audio of one's home
would contain

25:19.644 --> 25:21.395
the most intimate
of conversations --

25:21.395 --> 25:23.564
a fight with a spouse,

25:23.564 --> 25:26.776
crying baby, lovemaking.

25:26.776 --> 25:30.112
It is not just a question
of civil liberties.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.323
It's a question
of decency, too.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.411
Thank you.

Kemlot Bio-chem is getting
acquired by Far East P&C

25:50.007 --> 25:53.260
at over a hundred dollars
a share in cash and stock.

25:53.260 --> 25:56.055
Holy shit.
Axe is gonna make --

25:56.055 --> 25:59.850
Close to 100 million profit
on a dirty as shit trade.

25:59.850 --> 26:01.477
You have confirmation
of the source?

26:01.477 --> 26:02.770
We will when
they bring Donnie in.

26:02.770 --> 26:04.146
Yeah,
where the fuck is Donnie?

26:04.146 --> 26:06.650
-Waiting on word. Soon.
-Well...

26:06.650 --> 26:09.110
then it's a lock.

Jesus, we -- we...
we gotta celebrate.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.369
We should...
You know, we should, uh --

26:18.369 --> 26:19.829
We should, um...

26:19.829 --> 26:21.163
What? Get dinner?

26:21.163 --> 26:22.581
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.209
A real one? Or should I bring
my dad again?

26:25.209 --> 26:26.752
-Oh. [scoffs]
-Mnh-mnh?

26:26.752 --> 26:28.587
-Oh, okay. [laughs]

26:33.092 --> 26:35.386
-Terri.

26:35.386 --> 26:38.305
-It's just business.
[cellphone continues vibrating]

26:38.305 --> 26:39.808
Yeah?

26:42.811 --> 26:45.689

27:06.500 --> 27:08.502
She's good. [clicks teeth]

27:08.502 --> 27:10.796
She's not that stoked
about you dropping by.

27:10.796 --> 27:13.716
Come on. This isn't that.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.509
You know what this is.

27:15.509 --> 27:18.847
Hey, you married the guy,
you know?

27:18.847 --> 27:22.726
You wanted the big life --
bigger than I could give ya.

27:22.726 --> 27:25.352
You got the ups.
Now you get the downs.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.690
You and me were all but done
when I met him.

27:28.690 --> 27:32.151
You know, just making sure
lines aren't blurred,

27:32.151 --> 27:35.112
that you're not maybe helping
the guys be pissed off.

27:35.112 --> 27:39.200
Nah. No, everything's clear,
not blurred.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.659
And I don't need any help.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.245
The whole department's
pretty bent, matter of fact.

27:43.245 --> 27:45.832
After all the support?
I mean, all the money that

27:45.832 --> 27:48.084
Bobby's poured into
the Firefighters Foundation?

27:48.084 --> 27:51.212
I guess the sentiment is
his money's cheap...

27:51.212 --> 27:52.421
and dirty.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.216
Quarter of a billion dollars
cheap?

27:55.216 --> 27:58.344
-Over the past dozen years?
-I don't give a fuck.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.722

28:00.722 --> 28:03.140
Nobody did anything
to hurt you guys.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.810
It's just circumstance.

28:05.810 --> 28:07.812
I'm hoping you can
carry that message.

28:07.812 --> 28:10.231
Nah, I don't see it
like that.

28:10.231 --> 28:13.317
And I'm not carrying that...
[scoffs] anywhere.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.278
Then you're
a fucking simpleton,

28:16.278 --> 28:18.739
and that  is why it didn't
work out between us.

28:28.582 --> 28:30.417
Donnie Caan still MIA.

28:30.417 --> 28:31.877
Overnight?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.712
We've got the arrest warrant
almost baked

28:33.712 --> 28:34.881
and no chief witness.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.674
-Fucking find him!
-I'm on it.

28:36.674 --> 28:37.800
They've got
physical surveillance

28:37.800 --> 28:39.385
up on his home
and relatives,

28:39.385 --> 28:42.179
tracking his credit cards,
his phones, his E-ZPass.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.682
We put a-a red notice
on his passport file.

28:44.682 --> 28:46.559
We're also following
social media.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.768
Haven't gotten anything yet,
but --

28:47.768 --> 28:50.855
Really? He's not
live tweeting his escape?

28:50.855 --> 28:52.314

I'll get these
violations cleared.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.410
I'll have my guys talk
to the fire marshal.
[kisses]

29:04.410 --> 29:05.787
It's bigger than that.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.413
Something else happen?

29:07.413 --> 29:10.207
No. It's just...

29:10.207 --> 29:12.918
I just don't think the local
captain's gonna stop on his own.

29:12.918 --> 29:16.965
What's your family saying?

29:16.965 --> 29:18.799
They're behind you 100%.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.928
But the New York firehouses,
you know, the ones who lost

29:21.928 --> 29:23.596
-...their guys in 9/11?
-Mm-hmm.

29:23.596 --> 29:26.682
-They're calling the shots.
-Mm.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.852
Everything will smooth out
if they're satisfied.

29:28.852 --> 29:32.981
I get the message.
I'll fix this.

29:32.981 --> 29:34.773
[knock on door]
-It's open.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.442
[typing on laptop,
door latch clicks]

29:36.442 --> 29:37.651
You have time
for an old friend?

29:37.651 --> 29:38.987
Chase.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.404
[door closes]
-Hi.

29:43.741 --> 29:44.992
Bold move.

29:44.992 --> 29:47.328
I'm not here to headhunt you
at your place of work.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.705
I was just pitching some
of my best clients to Wags.

29:49.705 --> 29:52.208
I've got a dozen young traders
and PMs all dying to work here,

29:52.208 --> 29:54.878
and no one seems to give a shit
about the reputational damage.

29:54.878 --> 29:56.003
Uh-huh.

29:56.003 --> 29:58.339
[chuckles] One of my favorite
things about you --

29:58.339 --> 29:59.715
you're smarter than me.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.885
You're right.
I have an ulterior motive.

30:01.885 --> 30:03.594
I'm wondering why you
turned down your dream job.

30:03.594 --> 30:04.888
That company
I told you about,

30:04.888 --> 30:06.138
they said they'd
follow it up with --

30:06.138 --> 30:07.848
I can't bail on this place
right now,

30:07.848 --> 30:11.393
not with Occupy Westport
in the parking lot.

30:11.393 --> 30:13.520
This is when my guys
actually need me the most.

30:13.520 --> 30:16.941
If the company needs
to fill the spot this week,

30:16.941 --> 30:18.567
let it go.

30:18.567 --> 30:20.027
Okay.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.113
All right, you're not ready
for a new life. How 'bout this?

30:23.113 --> 30:25.241
There is a bar
opening on Bowery.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.659
A speakeasy, it says.

30:26.659 --> 30:29.703
Apparently they're not aware
that Prohibition has ended.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.706
I'm hoping I can cadge us
some cheap drinks.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.251
[sighs] There is so much about
that invitation I like.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.336
The taste of bathtub gin.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.546
Yes.

30:42.466 --> 30:43.759
I think you better get going

30:43.759 --> 30:45.344
before this starts
to look weird.

30:45.344 --> 30:47.596
[knock on door]

30:47.596 --> 30:48.973
Come in.

30:48.973 --> 30:50.307
[door latch clicks]

30:50.307 --> 30:52.894
Lara, hi.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.688
Uh...this is Chase.
He was just --

30:55.688 --> 30:58.524
I was just heading out.

30:58.524 --> 30:59.943
Nice to meet you, Lara.

31:06.115 --> 31:07.741
[door closes]

31:07.741 --> 31:08.909
Can I sit?

31:08.909 --> 31:10.703
Of course.

31:12.621 --> 31:13.957
-[clears throat]
-Is everything okay?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.126
Not really.

31:17.126 --> 31:19.962
[chair shifts]
-This feels like a session.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.423
Call it what you want.

31:22.423 --> 31:23.841
I need advice.

31:23.841 --> 31:25.217
Shoot.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.887
That hatchet job on Bobby...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.723
They're coming after
my restaurant.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.976
[sighs] I am so sorry.

31:32.976 --> 31:36.312
Yeah. Well,
doesn't just hurt me.

31:36.312 --> 31:38.731
You know, my sister,
all my people --

31:38.731 --> 31:40.774
they count on that place.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.068
It's all they have.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.778
I'm not sure
what kind of advice --

31:44.778 --> 31:46.864
Just tell me, if you were
in my situation,

31:46.864 --> 31:48.240
what would you do?

31:48.240 --> 31:50.784
You know, if you hadn't
done anything wrong,

31:50.784 --> 31:52.745
but you were targeted
anyway.

31:52.745 --> 31:54.455
Collateral damage.

31:54.455 --> 31:57.666
And not just you,
anyone you love --

31:57.666 --> 32:00.002
your friends, employees,

32:00.002 --> 32:03.297
your family, your children.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.758
Does that feel right
to you?

32:05.758 --> 32:07.217
Does that feel like
justice?

32:07.217 --> 32:12.140
You want me to pressure
my husband to back off.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.140
You know I can't do that.

32:13.140 --> 32:15.559
Why not?

32:15.559 --> 32:17.102
First of all,
Chuck is recused.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.979
[laughs] Yeah,
I know what he says.

32:18.979 --> 32:23.151
Let me be clear.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.985
This is my job.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.404
My husband's job is his.

32:27.404 --> 32:28.781
I've drawn a line.

32:28.781 --> 32:31.117
Well, then you're
really, really lucky

32:31.117 --> 32:33.077
'cause I sure as fuck can't.

32:33.077 --> 32:36.246
â™ª tense music â™ª

32:36.246 --> 32:39.000
[heels clack on floor]

32:41.460 --> 32:43.962
[heels clack, pen scribbling]

32:43.962 --> 32:45.255
[paper rips]

32:45.255 --> 32:46.465
Therapist I went
to school with,

32:46.465 --> 32:48.009
if you really need
someone to talk to.

32:48.009 --> 32:51.012
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

32:53.680 --> 32:55.682
[footsteps depart]

32:55.682 --> 32:58.102
[door opens]

32:58.102 --> 33:00.270
[door closes]
-[exhales deeply]

33:00.270 --> 33:03.190
[indistinct conversations]

33:06.069 --> 33:08.570
[door latch clicks]

33:08.570 --> 33:11.365
[Wags] I figured this would be
a good place to talk.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.785
I usually get full bars.

33:14.785 --> 33:16.703
Now...nothing.

33:16.703 --> 33:20.374
Imagine that.
When do you come in here?

33:20.374 --> 33:23.211
It's a great place to jerk off
when you're not around.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.881
A few things -- Kemlot popped
on the acquisition news.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.049
Three-run homer.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.926
Maybe a grand slam
by the time it's done.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.052
-Good.
-Yeah.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.720
Now ask me what
you really wanna know.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.056
Where the fuck is Donnie?

33:36.056 --> 33:38.225
-[sighs]
-I was on board
with the rest of it.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.727
But where did you
stash him...and why?

33:40.727 --> 33:42.855
I didn't,
and I don't know.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.066
So this isn't like
what happened with the Pouch?

33:45.066 --> 33:47.193
You're not just disinforming me
to be thorough?

33:47.193 --> 33:49.778
Not this time.
He's really gone.

33:49.778 --> 33:52.823
Even Hall hasn't been
able to find him.

33:52.823 --> 33:54.324
Fuck.

33:54.324 --> 33:56.535
Well, what now?

33:56.535 --> 33:59.121
I don't know.

34:01.874 --> 34:03.167
Ay.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.211
[vehicle passing,
dog barking in distance]

34:06.211 --> 34:09.298
You should've seen Spencer's
father at back to school night.

34:09.298 --> 34:12.759
He was grilling the teacher
about AP English prep.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.136
These are fourth graders.

34:14.136 --> 34:16.097
[smacks lips]
Well, the douchebag apple

34:16.097 --> 34:18.099
doesn't fall far
from the douchebag tree.

34:18.099 --> 34:20.559
[cellphone vibrating,
utensils clatter]

34:20.559 --> 34:22.644
[chewing] Yeah?

34:22.644 --> 34:25.856
[Bryan] We got a hit
on Donnie's E-ZPass.

34:25.856 --> 34:26.982
[chair squeaks]
-Uh-huh.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.276
The Mass Pike.

34:28.276 --> 34:29.902
State trooper's waiting
in the next tollbooth.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.112
Should be soon now.

34:31.112 --> 34:33.281
Got it. Thanks.
[clicks teeth]

34:33.281 --> 34:34.114
[cellphone thuds]

34:34.114 --> 34:35.282
[sighs]

34:35.282 --> 34:38.076
I'm so sorry.
I gotta get to the office.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.121
-Everything okay?
-Mm-hmm.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.206
[chair wheels rattle]
-[kisses]

34:42.206 --> 34:43.999

34:57.304 --> 35:00.724
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:02.226 --> 35:04.228
This is it. All units go.

[sirens wailing]

35:09.192 --> 35:10.318
[brakes squeal,

35:10.318 --> 35:11.693
[man] Let's go. Move, move!

35:11.693 --> 35:13.279
[female officer
shouts indistinctly]

35:15.323 --> 35:17.158
Put your hands on
the fucking steering wheel!

35:17.158 --> 35:18.325
Get 'em up!

35:18.325 --> 35:20.953
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:20.953 --> 35:23.330
[indistinct radio chatter,
horn honks in distance]

35:23.330 --> 35:26.750
Sarge, I think
we got a problem.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.794
It isn't even
the subject's car.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.421
Well, then why the fuck
did your alert go off?

35:31.421 --> 35:33.257
It is  Caan's E-ZPass.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.842
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:35.842 --> 35:37.553
Did this guy stop anywhere?

35:37.553 --> 35:39.054
Rest stop in Jersey.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.224
Motherfucker

35:41.224 --> 35:43.934
swapped it out.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.400
-Fuck! Fuck! I...
[receiver clatters]

35:51.400 --> 35:52.568
Fuck!

35:52.568 --> 35:53.860
[receiver thuds]

35:53.860 --> 35:55.529
[sighs]

35:55.529 --> 35:58.490
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

35:58.490 --> 36:00.951
Mm.

36:00.951 --> 36:05.373
Oh, they are, to a person,
clever motherfuckers.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.874
Scheming.

36:07.874 --> 36:11.837
Well, you gotta salute it
in a way. [laughs and sighs]

36:11.837 --> 36:14.339
I'm sorry
to have pulled you in.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.384
No, no, no.

36:16.384 --> 36:19.303
That's the problem here.

36:19.303 --> 36:22.055
Well, you're apologizing
because the lion next door

36:22.055 --> 36:24.392
ate our schnauzer.

36:24.392 --> 36:26.352
I mean, we really shouldn't
be surprised.

36:26.352 --> 36:28.312
Maybe we should've thought
of that possibility

36:28.312 --> 36:30.188
before we moved in
and let the dog out.

36:30.188 --> 36:32.816
Their entire industry

36:32.816 --> 36:35.694
is built on going long
and short

36:35.694 --> 36:39.365
at the same time.

36:39.365 --> 36:42.618
Both employing risk
for its asymmetrical upside

36:42.618 --> 36:46.413
and laying off risk

36:46.413 --> 36:49.666
as a hedge against
the inevitable downward turns.

36:49.666 --> 36:52.878
[scoffs]

36:52.878 --> 36:55.088
No, it's time we stop
appreciating it

36:55.088 --> 36:57.215
and start to mirror it.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.598
[door opens]

37:04.598 --> 37:06.892
[door closes]

37:08.352 --> 37:10.271
[Chuck] Thanks for agreeing
to see me.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.272
Sorry it's so late.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.231
[door closes]

37:13.231 --> 37:16.360
Thank you. [sighs]

37:16.360 --> 37:17.736

[footsteps depart]

37:24.993 --> 37:27.079
[clears throat]

37:27.079 --> 37:28.456
What's this about?

37:28.456 --> 37:30.332
Well, this is
your make-up call.

37:30.332 --> 37:34.169
Judge Wilcox --
you had a problem with him.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.463
-Yeah, US vs. Tritter.
-Mm-hmm.

37:36.463 --> 37:39.841
I asked for seven years
on gun trafficking.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.344
Some kid in the projects.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.346
Wilcox gave him 35 years.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.474
[sighs]

37:46.474 --> 37:50.060
It's fucking
frontier justice.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.104
It nagged at me.

37:52.104 --> 37:53.522
I asked you if I could do

37:53.522 --> 37:57.025
an off-book investigation
on Wilcox, but you shut me down.

37:57.025 --> 37:58.235
Do you remember
what you told me?

37:58.235 --> 37:59.319
No.

37:59.319 --> 38:02.406
"At least he's
a prosecutor's judge."

38:02.406 --> 38:04.157
[clicks teeth]
I've reconsidered.

38:04.157 --> 38:05.368
[scoffs softly] Why?

38:05.368 --> 38:07.828
Like Keynes said,

38:07.828 --> 38:10.288
"When the facts change..."

38:10.288 --> 38:12.040
[sighs]

38:12.040 --> 38:14.334
Look into Wilcox.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.919
Go wherever it leads.

38:15.919 --> 38:20.757
You're making a move
on a federal judge.

38:20.757 --> 38:23.511
Is he in your way?
What's your beef with him?

38:23.511 --> 38:26.389
-If he's clean, none at all.
[footsteps approach]

38:26.389 --> 38:29.641
[sighs heavily]
My practice time, Lon.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.226
Carnegie Hall, you know?

38:31.226 --> 38:33.437
Honey, this is
the US Attorney.

38:33.437 --> 38:34.646
No, no, no, no.

38:34.646 --> 38:37.399
I used to get the same way
before a big closing statement.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.818
I admire it,
and I will be on my way.

38:44.448 --> 38:45.991
[sighs]

38:45.991 --> 38:47.784
I may need some help
with the judge thing.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.370
[piano playing classical piece]
-You'll get it.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.496
And you know Eastern's gonna
have to be involved now.

38:51.496 --> 38:56.126
Credit's not important when
true justice is involved.

38:56.126 --> 38:58.503
[whispers] Of course.

38:58.503 --> 38:59.796
[palm slaps, hands shake]

38:59.796 --> 39:03.551
[slaps shoulder,
piano continues playing]

39:03.551 --> 39:06.136
Where the fuck  is Donnie?

39:06.136 --> 39:08.472
[vehicles passing]

39:08.472 --> 39:11.433
He's not just soaking
in some isolation tank.

39:11.433 --> 39:13.393
He's thinking.

39:13.393 --> 39:15.896
And at the end of this, he could
decide to walk into their office

39:15.896 --> 39:18.441
-...and tell 'em everything.
[train whistle blows]

39:18.441 --> 39:20.734
-[sighs]
-They'll pull up the timetable,
and we are over.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.944
Well, I can tell you
that hasn't happened yet.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.613
He is not
in Federal custody.

39:24.613 --> 39:26.198
You get that from your janitor?

39:26.198 --> 39:29.576
Also from Washington.
I've confirmed.

39:29.576 --> 39:31.995
You knew the risk when you put
this thing in motion.

39:31.995 --> 39:35.207
Yeah. Yeah, this part wasn't
hedged. It was straight risk.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.542
You said the hedge was that
you read your guy.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.378
If that was your read, then you
were right and still are.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.838
Yeah, well, it sounds good
when you say it.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.381
Doesn't make it true.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.551
[sighs]

39:49.888 --> 39:52.516
-Get something to eat?
-No.

settle down.

[siren wailing in distance]

40:31.597 --> 40:33.474
[inhales deeply]

40:40.981 --> 40:43.567
You hate me.

40:43.567 --> 40:46.654
I don't blame you.

40:46.654 --> 40:50.407
You lost more than I could
ever imagine that day --

40:50.407 --> 40:52.242
colleagues, friends,

40:52.242 --> 40:54.160
including
Lara's brother, Dean.

40:55.954 --> 40:58.373
I met Lara in an aid tent.

40:58.373 --> 41:02.085
She was just
out of nursing school.

41:02.085 --> 41:05.797
I didn't know she lost
her brother in the Towers.

41:05.797 --> 41:09.467
But when I found out...

41:09.467 --> 41:12.137
I realized what I'd done.

41:12.137 --> 41:14.557
It brought it home.

41:17.643 --> 41:21.438
And I want you to know this...

41:21.438 --> 41:25.191
that when I started donating to
the Firefighters Foundation...

41:27.402 --> 41:29.988
It wasn't calculated.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.407
It was out of real admiration.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.909
[scoffs]

41:33.909 --> 41:36.912
[murmuring]
-[man] Total BS.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.331
[murmuring continues]

41:39.331 --> 41:42.751
Paul. Talk to me.

41:42.751 --> 41:44.628
You sound like
a fucking politician.

41:44.628 --> 41:47.088
[Mikey]
You gonna buy us, too, Axe?

41:47.088 --> 41:48.590
How much do I cost?

41:48.590 --> 41:52.093
Really, Mikey? Try to show
a tiny bit of restraint.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.390
They're entitled
to their anger. Mikey, too.

41:57.390 --> 42:00.310
[vehicles passing in distance]

42:02.646 --> 42:04.105
You all read the articles.

42:04.105 --> 42:07.233
You know I made those trades
after the first tower was hit,

42:07.233 --> 42:09.069
before we knew
it was terrorism,

42:09.069 --> 42:11.821
before I knew my whole firm
was gonna die.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.574
That's your fucking excuse?

42:13.574 --> 42:15.992
No.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.119
What the papers didn't say

42:18.119 --> 42:20.914
is that I kept trading after
the South Tower was hit, too.

42:20.914 --> 42:22.999
In fact, that's when
I stepped on the gas.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.751
[man scoffs] Oh, man.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.462
[murmuring]

42:27.462 --> 42:29.589
Am I a politician now?

42:29.589 --> 42:32.592
â™ª tense music â™ª

42:35.596 --> 42:37.555
I'm not running and hiding.

42:37.555 --> 42:42.268
I am standing right here,
telling you,

42:42.268 --> 42:45.438
I didn't do it for me.

42:45.438 --> 42:48.566
I have plenty of time left
to make myself some money.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.904
I did it because even though
I knew my  colleagues,

42:52.904 --> 42:54.906
my  friends would all be gone,

42:54.906 --> 42:56.574
their families
would still be here,

42:56.574 --> 42:58.868
and they would be
my responsibility.

42:58.868 --> 43:01.830
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:01.830 --> 43:04.082
Was it coldhearted?

43:04.082 --> 43:06.794
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:06.794 --> 43:08.294
Yes.

43:08.294 --> 43:10.213
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:10.213 --> 43:13.008
I thought I had to be.
Maybe I was wrong.

43:13.008 --> 43:16.177
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:16.177 --> 43:19.222
Look, the reason I'm here

43:19.222 --> 43:21.516
is because I value you guys --

43:21.516 --> 43:24.060
my relationship
with the department,

43:24.060 --> 43:25.562
but especially with this house.

43:25.562 --> 43:28.982
We drank together
on the anniversary.

43:28.982 --> 43:32.444
You matter to me.

43:32.444 --> 43:35.613
And even if
I don't matter to you,

43:35.613 --> 43:37.824
I wanted you to hear it.

43:37.824 --> 43:40.035
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

43:40.035 --> 43:42.287
-[man sighs]
-[man] Hmm.

43:42.287 --> 43:45.248
So thanks for giving me
the chance.

44:29.710 --> 44:30.710
Yes?

44:30.710 --> 44:32.713
Do you know the rules?

44:32.713 --> 44:34.757
No.

44:34.757 --> 44:37.258
He'll know your name.

44:37.258 --> 44:39.636
You'll have two minutes.

44:39.636 --> 44:41.889
You can ask questions.

44:41.889 --> 44:44.057
He might give you a gift.

44:44.057 --> 44:46.309
And he can touch you,

44:46.309 --> 44:48.854
but you can't touch him.

Donnie Caan finally used
his credit card

46:16.649 --> 46:18.234
at Trapper Lodge.

46:18.234 --> 46:20.737
Some shitty restaurant
in downtown Cleveland.

46:20.737 --> 46:22.822
-Mm-hmm. Did you send in locals?

-Gone when they got there,

46:24.240 --> 46:26.618

before we wrap him up now.

He'll be coming back home.

-Who will be?
-Uh...

-Fugitive.

Which one?

-I know what you're implying.

47:07.992 --> 47:11.913
We agreed with Decker, you
wouldn't ask me about Axelrod.

47:11.913 --> 47:14.040
That's when you were on the
case. You told me you were off.

we shouldn't be talking

49:16.079 --> 49:18.081
I'll be back in the office
tomorrow.

49:18.081 --> 49:20.042
You scared the shit
out of me.

I know. I'm sorry.

That stuff you said...

What's there?

The bus is being towed.
[door closes]

51:10.526 --> 51:13.196
They actually accepted
limo rides home?

51:13.196 --> 51:15.406
Well, no one turns down a limo.

51:15.406 --> 51:18.409
[wind blowing]

51:20.495 --> 51:22.079
Hey.

51:22.079 --> 51:23.706
[footsteps]

51:23.706 --> 51:25.374
Sorry.
I was at the restaurant.

51:25.374 --> 51:27.418
[sweater drops]

51:27.418 --> 51:28.920
[sighs]

51:28.920 --> 51:30.713
Made some decisions.

51:30.713 --> 51:33.799
[boots unzip]
-You shuttered it.

51:33.799 --> 51:36.719
I'm selling the farm, too.

51:41.308 --> 51:43.100
[pulls boots off, boots thud]

[mattress thuds]

51:52.860 --> 51:55.238
Why didn't you tell me?

51:55.238 --> 51:56.989
I'm telling you now.

51:56.989 --> 51:59.825
We could've held on,
the restaurant and  the farm.

51:59.825 --> 52:03.079
-How?
-By not letting go.

52:03.079 --> 52:08.918
I don't give a shit if people
didn't show up for ten years.

52:08.918 --> 52:12.214
People forget.
Things change.

52:12.214 --> 52:16.467
-We could've fought.
-This is  me fighting.

52:16.467 --> 52:19.679
I come from a long line
of scrappers.

52:19.679 --> 52:21.430
We learn to get rid
of our weaknesses

52:21.430 --> 52:23.266
so we can fight better.

52:23.266 --> 52:24.183

52:33.526 --> 52:35.945
[sighs]

52:43.286 --> 52:46.872
When things
get really bad,

52:46.872 --> 52:49.292
I shut down.

52:49.292 --> 52:52.044
I go on autopilot.
I know.

52:52.044 --> 52:54.171
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

52:54.171 --> 52:58.718
I did it on 9/11.
I did it here.

52:58.718 --> 53:02.263
That's the only way
I know.

53:02.263 --> 53:04.515
You gotta find another way.

53:04.515 --> 53:07.518
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

53:12.898 --> 53:15.776
It was...

53:15.776 --> 53:19.655
I don't know. Like a long,
dark night of the soul.

53:19.655 --> 53:23.534
Don't fucking toss
clichÃ©s at me.

53:23.534 --> 53:25.328
You had some crisis?
Fine. See a shrink.

53:25.328 --> 53:27.955
But you -- you were
having fun jerking us around.

53:27.955 --> 53:31.751
[filtered voice] Look,
the E-ZPass...I was scared.

53:31.751 --> 53:33.711
I came back on my own,
didn't I?

53:33.711 --> 53:37.423
Plus, I got you Axe ordering
the Kemlot trade.

53:37.423 --> 53:38.549
Everything you asked for.

53:38.549 --> 53:40.676
No, not everything.

53:40.676 --> 53:42.928
We don't have the source
of the inside information,

53:42.928 --> 53:45.097
which you know is
a key fucking element

53:45.097 --> 53:46.308
in this prosecution,

53:46.308 --> 53:48.309
because he gave it to you
in the blocked room.

53:48.309 --> 53:50.770
I can tell you
everything Axe said.

53:50.770 --> 53:54.274
The insider source --
he's a high-ranking FDA guy.

53:54.274 --> 53:56.609
-Name?
-Uh, Glenn...

53:56.609 --> 53:58.986
Gilmartin, I think.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.323
-[typing]
-I'm sorry. I assumed
you had it on tape.

54:08.455 --> 54:11.374
[Dale] Guy's legit.
Works for the FDA.

54:12.833 --> 54:15.461
-What else did he say?
-[coughs]

54:15.461 --> 54:18.381
Uh, Axe paid him off,
didn't say how much.

54:18.381 --> 54:21.258
But I get the feeling...

54:21.258 --> 54:23.427
I get the...

54:23.427 --> 54:25.472
uh, get the...

54:25.472 --> 54:27.848
[exhales]

54:27.848 --> 54:30.309
I'm really tired.
Can we do this tomorrow?

54:30.309 --> 54:32.728
No, we fucking cannot.
Sit the fuck back down.

54:32.728 --> 54:34.772
Listen, I feel really sick.
You -- you're right.

54:34.772 --> 54:37.274
I did think about
not coming back.

54:37.274 --> 54:41.112
But I decided --
I'll give you what you need.

54:41.112 --> 54:43.072
I'll testify against Axe.

54:43.072 --> 54:45.199
But right now I need...
[coughs]

54:45.199 --> 54:47.494
-[Dale] Aah!
-Holy shit. Donnie!

54:47.494 --> 54:49.745
No. Donnie.

54:49.745 --> 54:51.205
[Terri, filtered voice]
Oh, fuck!

54:51.205 --> 54:52.289
[Bryan, filtered voice]
Donnie.

54:52.289 --> 54:54.542
Can you hear me? Donnie?

54:54.542 --> 54:56.168
I'll go get somebody.

54:56.168 --> 54:57.420
[Bryan] Get him
on his side over here.

54:57.420 --> 54:58.546
[door opens, closes]

54:58.546 --> 55:00.589
Goddamn it, Donnie.

55:00.589 --> 55:02.925
Donnie. Donnie!
Can you hear me?

55:02.925 --> 55:04.511
-[Bryan] Donnie?
-[Dale speaks indistinctly]

55:04.511 --> 55:07.179
Donnie. Goddamn it.

Donnie. Donnie!
