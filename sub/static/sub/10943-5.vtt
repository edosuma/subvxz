00:01.767 --> 00:03.200
I mean,
it's not just a break.

00:03.268 --> 00:05.001
We've been fighting
an awful lot lately.

00:05.069 --> 00:06.002
Well,
you guys always have.

00:06.070 --> 00:07.303
But like you said,

00:07.371 --> 00:08.404
you start fresh
in the morning, right?

00:08.473 --> 00:10.006
That whole reset
button thing?

00:10.074 --> 00:11.475
Not really working
anymore.

00:11.542 --> 00:12.943
(Baby cries,

00:13.010 --> 00:14.611
Shhh!
She needs some bouncing.

00:14.679 --> 00:15.712
She needs the constant movement.

(Baby cries,

00:20.851 --> 00:22.785
You've gotta be kidding.

No crying baby,

00:25.789 --> 00:26.956
just peace and quiet.

Caleb! Some of us have to work!

01:10.898 --> 01:12.197
Is he still in there?

01:12.265 --> 01:13.866
Yeah. If he uses all
of the hot water,

01:13.934 --> 01:15.401
I'm gonna kill him.

Is something wrong
with the shower at your house?

Are you kidding?

Good morning.

01:50.569 --> 01:52.002
Hey, good morning.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.606
So, um, I was thinking
since Soraya's back in town

01:55.674 --> 01:57.640
and Caleb could use
some cheering up,

01:57.708 --> 01:59.508
what do you say
we all go out tomorrow night?

01:59.577 --> 02:01.077
'Kay. What were you thinkin'?

02:01.144 --> 02:03.479
Well, um...

02:03.547 --> 02:04.814
I know this sounds crazy,

02:04.882 --> 02:07.483
but there's this
luau night thing at K.O.'s.

02:07.551 --> 02:08.751
Luau night...

02:08.818 --> 02:11.187
Like Hawaiian shirts
and hula dancing?

02:11.254 --> 02:12.421
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:12.489 --> 02:13.421
Caleb's gonna hate that.

02:13.489 --> 02:14.990
I know.

02:15.058 --> 02:16.491
But, see, it'll be good for him
to get his mind off

02:16.559 --> 02:18.560
that whole Ashley situation,
you know?

02:18.628 --> 02:20.462
I guess it could be fun.

02:20.529 --> 02:21.529
And it's not like
we have to dress up

02:21.598 --> 02:23.098
or anything, right?
So...

02:23.165 --> 02:25.667
Oh no, you're not getting
out of it that easy.

02:25.735 --> 02:27.368
If we're going to luau night,
then we're dressing up.

02:27.436 --> 02:28.536
Amy, we don't have-

02:28.604 --> 02:30.370
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>This is your idea.</i>

02:30.438 --> 02:32.573
Well, maybe I just changed
my mind, then.

02:32.641 --> 02:34.308
(Chuckles)
No, too late.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.877
Okay, well, I'm thinking
matching couples costumes.

02:36.945 --> 02:38.145
<i>Ty: What?!</i>
<i>Amy: Bye.</i>

02:38.213 --> 02:39.847
Ty: Amy, wai- (Amy hangs up)

02:39.915 --> 02:41.582
(Groans)

02:41.650 --> 02:43.818
Hey, Sandra,
I am sorry I'm late.

02:43.885 --> 02:45.384
It's been kind of
a crazy morning.

02:45.452 --> 02:46.753
It's okay.
But now I'm late,

02:46.821 --> 02:48.354
and you'd be surprised
how vicious

02:48.422 --> 02:50.991
a room full of nine-year-old's
in pink tutu's can be.

02:52.359 --> 02:55.095
I teach ballet at
the Hudson dance school.

02:55.162 --> 02:57.263
I took a dance class there
when I was a kid,

02:57.331 --> 02:59.699
but I guess horses sort
of won out.

02:59.767 --> 03:00.566
Who's this guy?

03:00.634 --> 03:02.400
Oh, Chaplin.

03:02.468 --> 03:04.369
I've had him
since I was a teenager.

03:04.437 --> 03:05.971
He's a great horse.

03:06.039 --> 03:07.339
I just don't have the time
to take care of him anymore.

03:07.406 --> 03:08.707
So you want me
to get him in shape,

03:08.775 --> 03:10.175
re-home him?

03:10.243 --> 03:11.677
Yeah. I've been trying
to sell him for awhile,

03:11.745 --> 03:15.347
but Chaplin's not great
with riders he isn't used to.

03:15.414 --> 03:17.181
Well, he looks like
a pretty smart guy.

03:17.249 --> 03:18.683
<i>Sandra:</i>
<i>He is.</i>

03:18.751 --> 03:21.318
He'll make somebody
a really great pleasure horse.

03:21.386 --> 03:22.620
(Sadly)
Won't you, boy?

03:25.223 --> 03:26.557
Um...

03:26.625 --> 03:28.760
So thanks for your help.
I have to go.

03:28.827 --> 03:30.028
Oh, wait.

03:30.095 --> 03:31.428
I don't know anything
about Chaplin.

03:31.496 --> 03:33.130
Did you compete on him,
or...?

03:33.197 --> 03:35.198
Just find him
a good home, okay?

03:35.266 --> 03:36.366
'Kay.

sports section there, Jack?

03:47.078 --> 03:48.678
It's all yours.

03:48.745 --> 03:49.879
Are you sure?

03:49.946 --> 03:51.547
Oh, is that today's
paper?

03:51.614 --> 03:52.648
Yeah. You looking
for business?

03:52.716 --> 03:53.649
No. Travel.

03:53.717 --> 03:55.117
I just want to make sure

03:55.185 --> 03:56.852
Lisa put in that ad
for the dude ranch on time.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.987
Oh, right.

04:00.290 --> 04:01.356
Caleb:
Is that today's paper?

04:01.424 --> 04:02.524
That's right;

04:02.592 --> 04:04.493
The paper I paid
the subscription for.

04:04.561 --> 04:06.861
The same one I rode out
to the mailbox

04:06.929 --> 04:08.129
to pick up this morning.

04:08.197 --> 04:09.597
Hit me up
with the comics.

04:09.665 --> 04:12.333
(Grumbling) You know what?
Just take the whole thing.

04:12.401 --> 04:13.467
Thanks.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.672
Mallory: Hey, Jack,
before you leave,

04:17.740 --> 04:19.640
there's something
I need to talk to you about.

04:19.709 --> 04:20.841
I didn't want
to say anything,

04:20.909 --> 04:22.309
but a certain co-worker
of mine

04:22.376 --> 04:24.377
isn't pulling his weight
around here.

04:24.445 --> 04:25.879
The truth is,

04:25.947 --> 04:28.015
Caleb's been moping around
ever since he got back.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.117
Now I have to do
all the heavy-lifting.

04:30.185 --> 04:31.251
Where are we going?

04:31.319 --> 04:32.652
I'm looking for
the perfect spot.

04:32.721 --> 04:34.287
For what?

04:34.355 --> 04:38.091
A man needs a quiet place
to read a newspaper...

04:38.158 --> 04:39.158
And when I was a kid,

04:39.226 --> 04:40.860
we had four rooms
and a path.

04:40.928 --> 04:42.061
A path to where?

04:42.129 --> 04:43.562
Jack:
The outhouse.

04:43.630 --> 04:44.897
In case you haven't noticed,

04:44.965 --> 04:46.465
there are six people living
on this ranch

04:46.533 --> 04:48.567
and only one bathroom.

04:48.635 --> 04:51.604
I tore one down
a few years ago,

04:52.539 --> 04:54.840
but I'm aimin'
to rebuild.

04:54.907 --> 04:57.408

No, Chaplin!

06:21.522 --> 06:23.156
Come on, I just want you
to go the other way.

06:24.959 --> 06:26.059
Hey.

06:27.528 --> 06:28.561
One of these days,

06:28.629 --> 06:30.395
a horse is gonna
talk back to you.

06:30.463 --> 06:32.031
Soraya!

06:32.098 --> 06:33.398
How was your trip?

06:33.466 --> 06:35.201
Well, after spending
a few weeks in London,

06:35.268 --> 06:37.803
I have a new-found appreciation
for fresh air,

06:37.871 --> 06:40.005
and driving on the right-hand
side of the road.

06:40.073 --> 06:41.740
I totally can't wait
to hear about your trip.

06:41.808 --> 06:43.042
I should probably
wait though

06:43.109 --> 06:44.676
till I put him back out
in the paddock first.

06:44.777 --> 06:46.811
Yeah, no, he's a pretty
good looking horse.

06:46.812 --> 06:48.847
He's quite the character.

06:48.914 --> 06:50.081
Brought him in the ring,

06:50.149 --> 06:51.515
he's all excited
to start loping around,

06:51.583 --> 06:53.184
but he only goes
counter-clockwise.

06:53.252 --> 06:54.185
As soon as I went
to turn him,

06:54.253 --> 06:55.220
he didn't wanna go.

06:55.287 --> 06:56.454
It's just
the weirdest thing.

06:56.521 --> 06:58.022
What'd his owner say?

06:58.090 --> 06:59.991
Nothing;
That's the problem.

07:01.860 --> 07:02.893
(Snorts)

07:06.797 --> 07:09.667
Get that thing
out of my face.

07:09.735 --> 07:12.236
I'm documenting your slow
descent into madness.

07:12.303 --> 07:14.304
I'm not going mad,
I'm solving a problem.

07:14.372 --> 07:16.173
Now help me unload
this lumber.

07:16.241 --> 07:18.207
- So Jack...
- Or don't.

07:18.275 --> 07:19.876
Why did you pick
this particular spot

07:19.943 --> 07:21.344
for your make-work
project?

07:22.312 --> 07:24.446
Well, it's not too far
from the house

07:24.514 --> 07:28.217
and it's downhill
for a nice, easy walk.

07:28.285 --> 07:29.485
I don't know much
about outhouses,

07:29.552 --> 07:31.187
but when it comes
to location,

07:31.255 --> 07:33.355
I'm pretty sure downhill
isn't nearly as important

07:33.422 --> 07:34.722
as downwind.

07:34.790 --> 07:36.491
What's going on here?

07:36.558 --> 07:37.859
Jack has bought
a one-way ticket

07:37.927 --> 07:39.460
on the cuckoo train
to stinksville.

07:43.900 --> 07:44.966
(Rope whooshes)

07:46.769 --> 07:49.069
Hey, does Jack know
you're out here?

07:49.137 --> 07:50.070
Well, Mallory said
something

07:50.138 --> 07:51.906
about Jack
digging a hole.

07:51.973 --> 07:54.341
The last time him and I
decided to do that,

07:54.409 --> 07:56.243
he nearly buried me
in it, so...

07:56.311 --> 07:57.677
I'm out here
laying low today.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.613
That's a good idea.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.416
So, uh, tomorrow night,

08:02.483 --> 08:04.118
you, me, Amy and Soraya--

08:04.185 --> 08:06.019
luau night at K.O.'s.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.753
What do you say?

08:07.821 --> 08:08.888
Uh, well...

08:09.823 --> 08:11.190
I don't know, man.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.825
Normally, watching drunk girls
in grass skirts

08:12.893 --> 08:13.993
would be a no-brainer,

08:14.061 --> 08:16.195
but...
not really in the mood.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.465
Well, that's why you need
to come with us.

08:19.533 --> 08:20.566
And it'll be good for you.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.401
You know,
get your mind off...

08:22.468 --> 08:23.868
<i>Things.</i>

08:23.937 --> 08:26.371
You mean, me and Ashley's
train wreck of a marriage.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.573
I wouldn't say
train wreck, man.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.042
I would.

08:30.109 --> 08:33.145
You know,
she threw her ring at me.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.380
I thought only people on TV
did stuff that.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.381
Well, maybe she just lost
her temper, man, you know?

08:38.450 --> 08:39.917
She'll cool down.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.921
That's why you guys are
on a break for, right?

08:43.989 --> 08:46.357
Nah! Let's just call
a spade a spade.

08:47.325 --> 08:49.692
Ashley and I are separated.

08:49.760 --> 08:50.860
Things aren't looking good.

08:53.764 --> 08:54.931
You know what?

08:54.999 --> 08:56.899
This luau night thing...
count me in.

08:56.968 --> 08:58.301
All right.

08:58.369 --> 08:59.635
Well, I won't let you down,
man,

08:59.703 --> 09:00.837
it'll be good.

09:00.904 --> 09:04.006
Ukuleles, mahi mahi,
mai tais, eh?

09:04.941 --> 09:06.708
There's a reason why
everyone's happy in Hawaii.

09:06.776 --> 09:10.112
Yeah, well, I mean,
I sure do like Tequila.

09:10.180 --> 09:13.415
That's the wrong country,
but who cares.

09:13.483 --> 09:15.117
(Laughing)

09:15.185 --> 09:17.286
Sandra:
Okay, sparkle princesses,

09:17.354 --> 09:18.287
we'll see you all
next week.

09:18.355 --> 09:20.488
And don't forget to put
your fairy wings at the front desk

09:20.555 --> 09:21.956
on your way out, okay?

09:22.024 --> 09:23.224
Okay, come on.

09:23.292 --> 09:24.959
Good, good, good.
(Laughs)

09:29.231 --> 09:30.164
Amy.

09:30.232 --> 09:31.765
Hey, I was just in town.

09:31.833 --> 09:33.401
I was wondering if you wanted
to grab a quick coffee?

09:33.469 --> 09:34.768
I'm sorry,
I have another class.

09:34.836 --> 09:36.303
<i>Well, I just-</i>

09:36.371 --> 09:37.737
I wanted to ask you a couple
questions about Chaplin

09:37.805 --> 09:39.706
'cause we didn't really
get a chance this morning.

09:39.773 --> 09:42.009
My classes are pretty much
back-to-back.

09:42.076 --> 09:44.311
Well, I just wanted to know
what you did with him?

09:44.379 --> 09:46.313
You know, barrel racing?
Another event?

09:48.449 --> 09:52.184
Um, everyone,
let's get warmed up.

09:52.252 --> 09:54.320
Look, he's a good horse.

09:54.388 --> 09:56.355
All you have to do is
get him used to new riders.

09:56.423 --> 09:57.589
It would just...

09:57.657 --> 09:58.957
It would really make my job
a lot easier

09:59.026 --> 10:00.092
if I knew the type
of relationship

10:00.160 --> 10:01.827
that you had with him.

10:01.895 --> 10:03.029
You know, for example,

10:03.096 --> 10:04.130
why did you train him
to just go

10:04.197 --> 10:06.098
in a counter-clockwise
pattern?

10:06.166 --> 10:08.133
I've only ever seen that
with trick-riding horses.

10:10.169 --> 10:11.469
Um, everyone,
let's take our places

10:11.537 --> 10:12.770
at the barre.

10:12.838 --> 10:15.606
I'd like to see some nice
and controlled plies and releves.

10:15.674 --> 10:17.142
Impress me.

10:18.344 --> 10:20.678
Look, I can't talk
about this right now.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.147
I'm sorry.

10:25.616 --> 10:27.051
Very good, girls.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.822
(Crickets chirp,
owl hoots)

10:32.890 --> 10:34.091
Lou:
It's a message.

10:34.159 --> 10:35.492
- What is?
- The outhouse.

10:35.560 --> 10:38.662
Grandpa thinks the house
is too crowded.

10:38.729 --> 10:40.129
Yeah, well,
maybe it's time

10:40.197 --> 10:42.031
we started thinking about
getting our own place.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.099
Yeah, right.

10:43.167 --> 10:45.168
Like we can afford
that.

10:47.237 --> 10:49.472
Actually, I um...

10:49.540 --> 10:50.473
I already talked
to my parents

10:50.541 --> 10:52.108
about getting a loan.

10:52.176 --> 10:53.642
- You what?
- Yeah.

10:54.578 --> 10:55.877
I know it's not ideal,

10:55.945 --> 10:57.011
but it's the only way
we're gonna come up

10:57.080 --> 10:59.347
with a decent down payment.

10:59.415 --> 11:01.049
You're serious.
You wanna buy a house?

11:01.117 --> 11:02.184
Absolutely.

11:03.086 --> 11:04.319
I mean,
it's either that,

11:04.387 --> 11:05.187
or we get used to
using the outhouse

11:05.254 --> 11:07.456
when it's minus 40 out.

11:07.523 --> 11:08.957
Okay... okay.

11:09.992 --> 11:11.559
All right.

11:11.626 --> 11:13.327
<i>What time should</i>
<i>we get up at?</i>

11:13.395 --> 11:14.861
Hey, you know what?

11:14.929 --> 11:17.831
Why don't we set
that later.

11:20.068 --> 11:21.268
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:25.907 --> 11:28.975
(Catherine cries)

11:29.042 --> 11:30.376
(Frustrated sigh)
It's okay.

11:30.444 --> 11:32.112
It's my turn,
I'll go.

11:32.179 --> 11:33.746
Right. Just go in,
make an appearance,

11:33.814 --> 11:34.981
and then leave.

11:35.048 --> 11:36.549
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the drill.

11:38.719 --> 11:40.253
<i>(Catherine wails)</i>

11:42.789 --> 11:44.256
Oh, thank God
you're back.

11:44.324 --> 11:45.324
The food has just
not been the same

11:45.391 --> 11:46.425
since you left.

11:46.493 --> 11:47.726
You do realize
it's the same cook

11:47.793 --> 11:48.860
in the kitchen.

11:48.928 --> 11:50.129
I just deliver the plates,
right?

11:50.196 --> 11:51.296
Yeah, but when it comes
to that smile of yours,

11:51.364 --> 11:53.132
it's like
ten times better.

11:53.199 --> 11:54.366
Yeah! See?

11:54.434 --> 11:55.734
That's the one
I'm talking about.

11:55.801 --> 11:56.968
I'm just glad Europe
didn't change you

11:57.036 --> 11:58.937
the way it changes
some people.

11:59.005 --> 12:01.672
How's Ashley,
by the way?

12:03.142 --> 12:04.208
Amy didn't tell you?

12:04.276 --> 12:05.343
Tell me what?

12:06.545 --> 12:07.778
Oh, man...

12:09.948 --> 12:11.616
Ashley and I decided
to call it quits.

12:11.683 --> 12:13.684
We've separated.

12:13.752 --> 12:15.218
Oh... um...

12:16.187 --> 12:17.487
Caleb, I-I'm so sorry.

12:17.555 --> 12:19.523
I mean, Amy told me you guys
were having trouble.

12:19.590 --> 12:20.624
I didn't know.

12:20.691 --> 12:23.226
It's okay.
Really, it is.

12:23.294 --> 12:24.994
Is she still in B.C.?

12:25.062 --> 12:26.796
Yeah,
Ashley's still there.

12:26.864 --> 12:28.265
Loves school.

12:28.332 --> 12:30.467
Especially since I'm not
cramping her style now.

12:30.535 --> 12:31.967
Well, um...

12:32.035 --> 12:32.968
If you were one
of my girlfriends,

12:33.036 --> 12:34.303
I'd make you a milkshake,

12:34.371 --> 12:36.405
but how about an extra side
of bacon instead?

12:36.473 --> 12:38.840
You do know the way
to a man's heart.

12:38.908 --> 12:41.310
'Course, I wouldn't say no
to a milkshake either.

12:41.378 --> 12:42.478
Coming right up.

12:50.886 --> 12:52.753
<i>(Blender whirs)</i>

12:53.389 --> 12:54.322
<i>Ty:</i> <i>I thought you were
supposed</i> <i>to be getting Chaplin</i>

12:54.390 --> 12:55.690
<i>used to new riders.</i>

12:55.757 --> 12:56.891
Amy: Well, I am.
But I can't do that

12:56.958 --> 12:59.694
unless I know what kind
of horse he is.

12:59.761 --> 13:02.197
Are you sure
he's a trick-riding horse?

13:02.264 --> 13:03.763
Yesterday, I was riding him
out in the round pen

13:03.831 --> 13:06.200
and he would only go
counter-clockwise,

13:06.267 --> 13:07.401
and that's something
that trick-riding horses

13:07.468 --> 13:08.535
are trained to do.

13:08.603 --> 13:10.136
And then,
I go and talk to Sandra,

13:10.205 --> 13:11.405
and when I mentioned it

13:11.472 --> 13:13.574
she just had
this weird reaction.

13:13.641 --> 13:15.041
And you know,
when you look at him,

13:15.109 --> 13:16.276
he is nice and solid,

13:16.344 --> 13:18.712
and he's got
a well-built neck.

13:18.779 --> 13:20.145
Ty: Well, I guess,
for any trick rider

13:20.214 --> 13:22.348
it'd be hard to balance
on a long, wobbly one.

13:22.416 --> 13:23.816
(Both chuckle)

13:23.883 --> 13:25.184
And coupled with a nice,
high set of withers...

13:25.252 --> 13:27.353
Makes him the perfect
trick-riding horse.

13:27.421 --> 13:29.555
Well, there's only one way
to find out.

13:32.459 --> 13:34.126
All right,
it's your job to call 911

13:34.194 --> 13:35.760
if this goes horribly wrong.

13:35.828 --> 13:37.562
Ty: So there's no way I can
talk you out of this then?

13:37.630 --> 13:39.931
Amy:
Uh, what do you think?

13:39.998 --> 13:41.199
(Amy chuckles)

13:43.969 --> 13:45.370
(Hoofbeats thud)

13:53.645 --> 13:55.245
♪

14:05.123 --> 14:06.624
whoa!

14:06.691 --> 14:08.190
That was incredible!

14:08.259 --> 14:09.759
Ha! Hey, not bad!

14:10.728 --> 14:12.395
Wow! He knew exactly
what to do

14:12.463 --> 14:14.530
when I was going in and out
of that trick.

14:14.598 --> 14:16.299
Chaplin's the real deal.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.635
Someone must have spent
a lot of time training him.

14:18.702 --> 14:20.002
Yeah.

14:20.070 --> 14:21.203
But what I don't get is

14:21.272 --> 14:23.705
why Sandra would keep that
from me.

14:28.177 --> 14:29.878
Lou:
It's perfect.

14:29.945 --> 14:31.513
It's only a few miles away
from here,

14:31.581 --> 14:32.648
it's a three-bedroom,

14:32.715 --> 14:35.083
and it's exactly
in our price range.

14:35.151 --> 14:37.486
(Chuckles) Yes,
it is perfect, honey.

14:37.553 --> 14:39.687
Which probably means
it's too good to be true.

14:39.755 --> 14:41.322
I thought you might
say that,

14:41.390 --> 14:43.457
so I set up an appointment
with our real estate agent

14:43.525 --> 14:44.858
in fifteen minutes.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.294
Fifteen minutes?

14:46.361 --> 14:48.861
We won't be able to pack
a diaper bag in that time.

14:49.230 --> 14:50.731
I got your text.

14:50.799 --> 14:52.866
Last minute babysitting
does cost extra.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.335
Lou: Mallory, you
are a lifesaver.

14:54.403 --> 14:55.935
Honey, let's go.

14:56.003 --> 14:57.537
Thanks.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.906
Five, four, three, two...

14:59.973 --> 15:01.474
Oh! I almost forgot.

15:01.542 --> 15:02.809
Just make sure you use
the bottles in the cupboard,

15:02.876 --> 15:04.277
not the ones
in the dish rack.

15:04.345 --> 15:06.913
And when she wakes up,
set the humidifier to 35.

15:06.980 --> 15:08.147
Oh, but if she doesn't
wake up,

15:08.215 --> 15:09.982
just leave it at 42
for like an hour

15:10.050 --> 15:11.250
and then lower it to 40,
okay?

15:11.318 --> 15:13.552
Peter: She's got it. Thanks.

15:15.422 --> 15:16.689
You know,
I can't believe

15:16.756 --> 15:18.156
there wouldn't be anything
on Sandra Martin?

15:18.224 --> 15:19.525
If she was a trick rider,

15:19.592 --> 15:21.293
you'd think there'd be
an article or something.

15:21.361 --> 15:22.861
Hey, guys,
heading into town.

15:22.929 --> 15:23.895
You need anything?

15:23.963 --> 15:25.130
No thanks, Caleb.

15:25.198 --> 15:26.565
Oh, actually,

15:26.633 --> 15:27.699
did you ever come across
a trick rider

15:27.766 --> 15:29.600
by the name
of Sandra Martin?

15:29.668 --> 15:30.802
Doesn't ring a bell,

15:30.869 --> 15:32.203
but I've met a lot
of trick riders.

15:32.270 --> 15:34.639
Well, she would be
about my height,

15:34.707 --> 15:36.674
kind of reddish,
curly hair.

15:36.742 --> 15:38.676
(Chuckles)
I know a lot of red-heads, too.

15:40.813 --> 15:42.613
You know, there were
these two trick riders

15:42.681 --> 15:43.947
you used to see a lot.

15:44.014 --> 15:46.450
One of them had long,
curly, red hair...

15:46.517 --> 15:47.884
Summerset sisters.

15:47.952 --> 15:49.018
Summerset.

15:49.086 --> 15:51.187
Could be a stage name
or something.

15:51.255 --> 15:52.489
Bingo.

15:52.557 --> 15:54.658
<i>Yeah. Yeah,</i>
<i>that's her right there.</i>

15:55.593 --> 15:57.594
Oh yeah! You know,
they were a pretty good act,

15:57.662 --> 15:59.595
<i>but I haven't seen them</i>
<i>on the circuit in long time.</i>

15:59.663 --> 16:00.929
They just sort
of disappeared.

16:00.997 --> 16:03.198
Well, there is contact
information here

16:03.266 --> 16:05.735
for her manager,
Nancy Summerset.

16:05.802 --> 16:06.802
Yeah, I'm seeing
if it's working right now.

16:06.870 --> 16:07.936
Caleb:
Best of luck, guys.

16:08.004 --> 16:09.004
- See you.
- See you, man.

16:09.072 --> 16:10.239
'Kay, it's ringing.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.076
Hi. Mrs. Summerset?

16:15.178 --> 16:16.444
I'm not surprised Sandra
didn't tell you

16:16.512 --> 16:18.212
about her trick-riding.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.014
That was a different life.

16:20.082 --> 16:21.282
How do you mean?

16:23.252 --> 16:24.886
Sandra and her sister,
Diana,

16:24.953 --> 16:26.254
were the best act
on the circuit.

16:27.923 --> 16:29.991
They were always so close.

16:30.058 --> 16:33.126
Not just as sisters,
but as riding partners.

16:33.194 --> 16:35.362
Then uh...

16:35.430 --> 16:36.463
Three years ago
in November,

16:36.531 --> 16:38.298
Diana was driving
to Saskatoon

16:38.366 --> 16:39.533
to visit her boyfriend

16:39.601 --> 16:42.469
and she lost control
of the truck.

16:42.537 --> 16:44.671
She was only 22.

16:46.207 --> 16:48.040
I'm so sorry.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.142
After Diana passed away,

16:51.311 --> 16:53.780
Sandra never really rode again.

16:54.715 --> 16:56.516
For a while there,
she didn't do much of anything.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.317
I don't blame her.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.685
And then two years ago,

16:59.753 --> 17:02.588
Sandra started to get
her life together.

17:02.656 --> 17:04.155
She got a job teaching
at the dance studio,

17:04.223 --> 17:05.424
she met a great guy.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.592
They were married
last year.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.827
For the first time
in a long while,

17:08.895 --> 17:11.563
things have been sort of...
happy.

17:13.098 --> 17:17.602
So why do you think that Sandra
waited until now to sell Chaplin?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.002
I wouldn't know.

17:19.070 --> 17:21.739
There are two things Sandra
refuses to talk about:

17:21.807 --> 17:24.207
Her sister and riding.

17:31.879 --> 17:33.913
I can't believe
we just put in an offer.

17:33.980 --> 17:35.715
Peter: Honey, we would
have been crazy not to.

17:35.783 --> 17:36.883
I mean, not only is it
move-in ready,

17:36.950 --> 17:38.350
but it's exactly
what we want.

17:38.419 --> 17:39.485
I don't know
what I loved more--

17:39.553 --> 17:40.820
the checkerboard tiles
in the kitchen

17:40.888 --> 17:42.721
or the exposed wood
in the dining room.

17:42.789 --> 17:44.756
I know! And that tree house
in the backyard?!

17:44.824 --> 17:46.925
I know! Katie's gonna have
so much fun playing in that!

17:46.992 --> 17:48.326
Katie?

17:48.394 --> 17:49.594
I mean, I'm gonna have fun
playing in that.

17:49.662 --> 17:51.329
I've already picked out
the paint colours:

17:51.397 --> 17:53.064
Dark gray
for the guest room,

17:53.132 --> 17:55.066
a warm yellow
for the kitchen,

17:55.134 --> 17:56.200
a light green
for the a nursery--

17:56.268 --> 17:58.302
Okay, okay. But...

17:58.369 --> 18:00.571
We cannot get our hopes up
too high here, okay?

18:00.639 --> 18:01.872
I mean, we just--
we have an offer in.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.206
We have no idea
what's gonna happen.

18:03.274 --> 18:04.207
I know,

18:04.275 --> 18:05.876
but I really want
this house.

18:05.944 --> 18:07.545
So do I.

18:07.612 --> 18:09.112
So did you guys buy a house
or what?

18:09.180 --> 18:10.848
Maybe, but we are
most definitely

18:10.916 --> 18:12.182
not getting our hopes up.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.583
(Phone rings)
That's right.

18:13.651 --> 18:15.217
Oh wow!
It's the real estate agent.

18:15.285 --> 18:17.821
- Al... already?
- Yeah. Agh!

18:18.756 --> 18:21.458
Hi, Barbara.
Um, good, good.

18:21.525 --> 18:22.859
<i>A little nervous, actually.</i>

18:22.927 --> 18:25.261
I didn't expect you
to get back to me this soon.

18:25.329 --> 18:27.196
Um...

18:27.264 --> 18:31.366
Right. Okay.
No, I understand. Yeah.

18:31.434 --> 18:34.269
Okay.
Thanks for calling. Bye.

18:35.237 --> 18:38.406
So they didn't accept
the offer.

18:38.475 --> 18:40.075
And not only that,

18:40.142 --> 18:41.643
but our offer was so low

18:41.711 --> 18:43.144
that they didn't even
bother to counter.

18:43.212 --> 18:44.980
What does that mean?

18:45.047 --> 18:47.882
It means we didn't
get the house.

18:47.950 --> 18:50.985
Hey, at least we didn't
get our hopes up, eh?

18:51.052 --> 18:52.520
(Scoffs)

18:54.222 --> 18:57.391
Which one of these say,
"I'm single and ready to party?"

18:57.459 --> 18:59.961
Um... I don't know.
They both kinda say,

19:00.028 --> 19:02.228
"I'm retired
and live in Palm Springs."

19:02.296 --> 19:04.364
Well, it's not really
what I was going for.

19:04.431 --> 19:05.866
Don't worry, I'll be off
in a few minutes.

19:05.933 --> 19:07.166
We will go back
to the thrift store

19:07.234 --> 19:09.636
and pick out something
perfect for tonight.

19:09.704 --> 19:10.737
You'd do that for me?

19:10.805 --> 19:12.672
Yeah. Sure.
It'll-it'll be fun.

19:12.740 --> 19:13.974
Think of me
as your personal stylist.

19:14.041 --> 19:16.209
Um, just give me ten,
okay?

19:16.276 --> 19:18.310
I'll wait right here.

19:19.779 --> 19:22.180
(Birds chirp,
leaves rustle)

19:24.784 --> 19:26.785
Peter: Jack?
<i>Jack: (Muffled) Peter!</i>

19:27.721 --> 19:29.388
Peter: Jack?
Jack: Peter!

19:29.455 --> 19:32.124
Unnggh!
How the heck are ya?

19:32.191 --> 19:34.091
I'm fine, thanks.
Good.

19:34.159 --> 19:35.760
So what do you think?

19:35.828 --> 19:36.961
Yeah, wow...

19:37.029 --> 19:38.863
You got yourself
a great big hole there.

19:39.798 --> 19:40.999
Geez,
you know, Jack,

19:41.066 --> 19:42.466
you could always put
a bathroom in the barn

19:42.535 --> 19:43.902
or another one in the house,
you know.

19:43.969 --> 19:45.570
What am I,
made out of money?

19:45.638 --> 19:48.806
Besides,
outhouses are Western tradition.

19:49.707 --> 19:51.508
Well, look,
I just uh...

19:52.410 --> 19:53.544
I hope me and Lou
aren't the reason

19:53.611 --> 19:55.045
you're doing all this.

19:55.112 --> 19:56.747
Oh, don't be silly.

19:57.949 --> 20:00.551
It's something I should've done
a long time ago.

20:01.485 --> 20:03.053
Right.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.956
Well,
hypothetically speaking then,

20:07.024 --> 20:08.357
um, if you were feeling
that it was getting

20:08.425 --> 20:09.825
a bit too crowded
in the house,

20:09.893 --> 20:11.060
I just wanted
to let you know

20:11.127 --> 20:13.162
that it is only temporary.

20:13.229 --> 20:16.632
You know, I do plan on
making a home for my family,

20:16.700 --> 20:17.967
eventually.

20:18.035 --> 20:21.136
Well, if that's the case,
hypothetically,

20:21.204 --> 20:24.338
I want you to know that,
temporary or not,

20:24.406 --> 20:26.541
you are welcome here
no matter how crowded

20:26.609 --> 20:28.043
the house might be.

20:28.110 --> 20:29.444
All right.

20:29.511 --> 20:32.581
Well, good.
Thank you, Jack. Thanks.

20:33.515 --> 20:35.550
Listen, why don't we
get going here.

20:35.618 --> 20:36.818
You want me
to give you a hand?

20:36.886 --> 20:39.119
Well, you wanna build
or you wanna dig?

20:41.255 --> 20:42.355
Uh...
(Sighs)

20:44.358 --> 20:45.559
(Laughing)

20:45.627 --> 20:47.494
Measure twice,
cut once.

20:47.562 --> 20:48.629
You got it.

20:51.299 --> 20:53.067
(Scrubbing sound)

20:55.803 --> 20:56.970
What's this?

20:57.037 --> 20:58.270
Sparkling apple juice,

20:58.338 --> 21:00.473
dark chocolate
roasted cashews...

21:00.540 --> 21:02.642
It's basically romance
in a basket.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.644
Okay,
and who's it for?

21:04.712 --> 21:07.080
It's a gift from me
to you and Peter.

21:07.147 --> 21:09.281
And I'm also offering
my babysitting services

21:09.349 --> 21:11.282
for the entire night -
for my usual fee.

21:11.350 --> 21:13.251
<i>And I looked into the bookings</i>
<i>at the dude ranch</i>

21:13.319 --> 21:14.786
and cabin "C" is vacant.

21:14.854 --> 21:17.089
So are "A" and "B",
so you'll have total privacy.

21:17.156 --> 21:19.124
And before you think
of a million reasons

21:19.191 --> 21:20.626
why this is a bad idea,

21:20.693 --> 21:22.393
just remember you're minutes
away from the baby

21:22.461 --> 21:23.962
in case anything bad
would happen -

21:24.030 --> 21:25.730
which it won't,

21:25.797 --> 21:29.566
because I'm the best babysitter
in the history of babysitters.

21:29.635 --> 21:30.935
So what's in it
for you?

21:31.003 --> 21:32.837
Can't I do something nice
for my favourite couple?

21:32.904 --> 21:34.404
Something to take
their mind off

21:34.472 --> 21:36.240
losing their dream home

21:36.307 --> 21:38.575
and the prospect of living
with Jack

21:38.644 --> 21:41.045
for the foreseeable future?

21:41.113 --> 21:42.245
You know what?

21:42.312 --> 21:43.346
I'm not gonna
over-think this.

21:43.413 --> 21:44.748
It's a nice offer,
you know?

21:44.815 --> 21:47.017
And Peter and I could use
a night alone.

21:47.084 --> 21:48.718
I'm gonna go start packing.

21:48.786 --> 21:49.819
Thank you.

21:51.055 --> 21:53.690
Five, four, three, two...

21:54.591 --> 21:56.492
Oh, before I forget,

21:56.560 --> 21:58.093
I'm gonna leave out
two sleepers for the baby,

21:58.161 --> 21:59.762
just in case it gets cold.

21:59.829 --> 22:01.429
And I'd prefer if you feed her
using the leather bib

22:01.497 --> 22:02.631
so you can just
wipe it off.

22:02.699 --> 22:04.232
'Cause that way
I have way less laundry.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.534
And one more thing,

22:05.601 --> 22:07.069
give her al least 10 minutes
of tummy time.

22:07.137 --> 22:08.103
There's no way my baby's

22:08.171 --> 22:09.504
gonna end up
with a flat head.

22:09.572 --> 22:11.840
Did I mention my rates
double after midnight?

22:11.908 --> 22:12.975
Right.

22:20.415 --> 22:21.448
Amy:
Sandra!

22:23.652 --> 22:25.419
You had no right
to talk to my mom.

22:25.487 --> 22:27.922
What? I was just trying
to help Chaplin.

22:27.990 --> 22:29.190
Prying into
my personal life

22:29.257 --> 22:30.691
has nothing to do
with selling a horse.

22:30.758 --> 22:31.992
Amy: 'Kay, well maybe if
you'd told me the truth

22:32.060 --> 22:33.259
in the first place,

22:33.327 --> 22:34.627
I wouldn't have had
to go through your mom.

22:34.696 --> 22:35.829
Sandra, she was just
trying to find

22:35.897 --> 22:37.030
the right kind
of owner for him.

22:37.098 --> 22:38.765
That's exactly
why I didn't tell you.

22:38.833 --> 22:40.100
There's no way
you're selling Chaplin

22:40.168 --> 22:42.035
to another trick rider.

22:42.103 --> 22:43.036
That makes
the most sense.

22:43.104 --> 22:44.237
Why not?

22:44.305 --> 22:45.371
You're not selling him
to anyone.

22:45.439 --> 22:47.006
I'm taking him home.

22:47.074 --> 22:48.174
Sandra, just hold on
a second okay?

22:48.241 --> 22:49.541
Hold on.

22:49.609 --> 22:50.843
Maybe Amy shouldn't have
talked to your mom.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.244
Maybe?

22:52.312 --> 22:53.645
You're right.
But if she did cross the line,

22:53.714 --> 22:54.747
it's because she thought
she was doing

22:54.815 --> 22:56.348
what's best for Chaplin.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.783
I'm really sorry.

22:57.851 --> 22:59.484
Look, please don't go.
Can we just talk about this?

22:59.552 --> 23:00.953
There's nothing
to talk about.

23:01.021 --> 23:02.754
Chaplin and I retired
from trick-riding

23:02.822 --> 23:04.255
a long time ago.

23:04.323 --> 23:06.324
The last thing I need
is you dredging up the past.

23:06.391 --> 23:08.626
Okay, wait.
Maybe you quit trick-riding,

23:08.694 --> 23:10.461
- Amy.
- But Chaplin didn't.

23:10.529 --> 23:11.696
Okay,
he's a trick-riding horse;

23:11.764 --> 23:13.264
That's what
he's trained to do.

23:13.332 --> 23:14.733
<i>And maybe the reason</i>
<i>he's not good with new riders</i>

23:14.800 --> 23:16.801
<i>is because he doesn't want</i>
<i>to just be ridden.</i>

23:16.869 --> 23:19.569
He wants to perform
like he used to.

23:19.637 --> 23:21.205
Chaplin is my horse,

23:21.272 --> 23:24.674
and I get to decide
what happens to him.

23:26.310 --> 23:27.377
(Truck engine starts)

23:40.295 --> 23:41.562
This was a great idea.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.297
Yeah, it was.

23:44.399 --> 23:45.565
And you know, honey,

23:45.633 --> 23:47.133
don't worry about the house,
okay?

23:47.201 --> 23:48.268
We just have to be patient

23:48.336 --> 23:49.636
and the right one
will come along.

23:49.704 --> 23:53.039
I know, but being patient
and not worrying

23:53.107 --> 23:54.974
aren't exactly
my strong suits.

23:55.042 --> 23:56.343
Well, you've been
pretty good

23:56.410 --> 23:58.211
about spending the night
away from the baby.

23:58.279 --> 23:59.646
It's been like 20 minutes

23:59.714 --> 24:01.013
and you haven't called
to check on her once.

24:01.081 --> 24:03.582
Yeah, well, that's kinda
because I made Mallory

24:03.650 --> 24:05.016
promise to text me
every 10 minutes

24:05.084 --> 24:06.985
with updates.

24:07.053 --> 24:08.086
See?

24:09.389 --> 24:10.489
Right.

24:11.691 --> 24:14.326
"7:30 pm:
The baby is sleeping."

24:14.394 --> 24:17.195
"7:40 pm:
Still sleeping."

24:17.263 --> 24:18.296
"Stop worrying, Lou.

24:18.364 --> 24:19.631
I rock this
babysitting thing."

24:19.698 --> 24:20.898
Unreal.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.134
(Low hum of chatter,
pool balls clack)

24:23.201 --> 24:25.270
Aloha!

24:25.337 --> 24:26.704
(Everyone stops talking)

24:27.373 --> 24:29.173
Amy: Are you sure we're
in the right place?

24:31.910 --> 24:34.311
Hey, what the hell happened
to luau night?

24:34.379 --> 24:36.246
Luau night?

24:36.314 --> 24:38.081
Where'd you get
that idea?

24:38.149 --> 24:40.284
It was on your website.

24:40.351 --> 24:43.553
I haven't updated that site
since 1998.

24:43.621 --> 24:46.856
But a luau...
that's not a bad idea.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.627
All right, guys,
minor glitch.

24:51.695 --> 24:53.262
That doesn't mean we still
can't have fun, right?

24:53.830 --> 24:55.331
- Mm-hm.
- Absolutely.

24:55.399 --> 24:57.099
Caleb: I'm just glad I
didn't go with the sarong.

24:58.635 --> 25:00.002
(Fire crackles)

25:05.275 --> 25:07.575
Jack: Don't your
thumbs ever get tired?

25:07.643 --> 25:09.911
Mallory: I promised to text
Lou updates on the baby,

25:09.978 --> 25:12.380
so it's strictly
work-related.

25:13.316 --> 25:15.517
Sounds like you're going
the extra mile.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.452
(Sighs) Well,
if I don't mess up tonight,

25:17.520 --> 25:21.355
I'll cement my status
as Lou's go-to babysitter.

25:22.290 --> 25:24.358
The plan is to have enough money
in my bank account

25:24.426 --> 25:27.394
so I can buy a super sweet car
for when I turn sixteen.

25:27.462 --> 25:28.862
I see.

25:28.930 --> 25:31.097
Offering to babysit
overnight,

25:31.165 --> 25:32.466
that's a little above
and beyond,

25:32.534 --> 25:33.500
don't you think?

25:33.568 --> 25:35.669
What is your real
angle here?

25:35.737 --> 25:36.737
The truth is,

25:36.805 --> 25:38.270
my grandma is still
at my place.

25:38.339 --> 25:40.573
I love her,
but she won't stop talking

25:40.641 --> 25:42.074
and she's always minding
everyone else's business

25:42.142 --> 25:44.176
and she won't go home.

25:44.244 --> 25:45.878
You have no idea
what it's like, Jack.

25:45.946 --> 25:47.447
Oh! You'd be surprised...

25:48.382 --> 25:51.217
(Under his breath)
at how I relate to that.

25:52.953 --> 25:55.654
Soraya: So that's what happened
with Chase in a nutshell.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.589
I'm filing him under
"hottie but a naughty"

25:57.657 --> 25:58.724
and moving right along.

25:58.791 --> 25:59.658
Well, he couldn't
have been all bad

25:59.726 --> 26:00.859
if you were with him.

26:00.926 --> 26:02.527
But, yeah,
tell you the truth,

26:02.595 --> 26:04.863
Chase was not good enough
for you.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.665
Well,
to being single.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.500
To being single...
Sorta.

26:12.036 --> 26:14.872
You know, I had a lot of fun
hanging out with you today.

26:14.939 --> 26:16.273
Me too.

26:16.341 --> 26:18.275
You being gone,
it just...

26:18.343 --> 26:20.244
It reminded me
how much I missed you

26:20.311 --> 26:21.779
when I was gone,

26:21.847 --> 26:23.814
and makes me wonder
why I ever left.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.115
Uh, I missed you too.

26:26.183 --> 26:27.650
There are very few girls

26:27.718 --> 26:29.719
that I feel like
I can be myself around.

26:29.787 --> 26:30.820
Even with Ashley,

26:30.888 --> 26:32.288
it was like
I'd get to thinking...

26:32.356 --> 26:34.557
Sit up straight,
or tuck in my shirt.

26:37.495 --> 26:39.295
With you,
it's just different.

26:39.363 --> 26:40.797
Well, of course
it's different.

26:40.865 --> 26:42.898
We're... we're pals.

26:42.965 --> 26:46.067
You know,
really good friends.

26:47.504 --> 26:51.373
Yeah, that's (Clears throat)
totally what I meant.

26:51.441 --> 26:53.108
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna get another drink,

26:53.175 --> 26:54.276
did you want one?

26:54.343 --> 26:56.745
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

Ty: Hey.
Caleb: Hey.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.083

to the bar in a swimsuit?

in the loft.

31:24.199 --> 31:25.232
You sleep in the loft?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.700
Yup.

- The baby.

Why didn't you
wake me up?

33:15.503 --> 33:16.769
I tried to,

33:16.837 --> 33:18.438
but you smacked me
in the jaw actually.

33:18.506 --> 33:19.439
You should think
about a career

the baby's older.

We didn't even touch
Mallory's gift basket.

33:26.481 --> 33:28.014
I know, but...

33:30.117 --> 33:31.883
We were kind of busy.

33:31.951 --> 33:34.086
Maybe we can have some cashews
for breakfast.

33:34.154 --> 33:36.388
That sounds wonderful.

33:36.456 --> 33:39.225
But first, I wanna
show you something.

33:39.292 --> 33:41.227
- What?
- C'mon. It's outside.

33:41.294 --> 33:42.461
- Outside?
- Just never mind.

taking me?

33:46.232 --> 33:48.099
Just come on.

33:49.801 --> 33:52.536
So...
What do you see?

33:54.306 --> 33:57.175
A lot of wasted space
badly in need of landscaping?

33:57.743 --> 33:59.344
Just look closer.
What do you...

33:59.411 --> 34:01.044
You're right.
Caleb forgot to mow the lawn.

34:01.112 --> 34:03.046
I am going to call him
right now.

34:03.114 --> 34:04.814
Okay,
you know what I see?

34:04.882 --> 34:06.316

big stone fire place,
gourmet kitchen,

with an enormous walk-in closet.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.326
What are you
talking about?

34:17.393 --> 34:19.661
You know, when I was
helping Jack yesterday, right?

34:19.728 --> 34:23.098
I kept thing about the time
that I spent with my dad

34:23.167 --> 34:25.568
helping him put the extension
to our house.

34:25.636 --> 34:26.869
I've actually done
a lot of renos

34:26.936 --> 34:27.870
over the years, Lou,

34:27.937 --> 34:29.172
and I'm pretty good at it.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.406
So, I figured instead
of waiting

34:30.474 --> 34:32.440
for the right place
to come along,

34:32.507 --> 34:33.408
why not build it?

34:33.476 --> 34:34.742
You mean,
do it yourself?

34:34.810 --> 34:36.545
Yeah, design and build
our own place--

34:36.612 --> 34:38.480
Yeah, exactly the way
we want it.

34:38.547 --> 34:40.248
Wow...

34:40.315 --> 34:42.150

get the okay

34:42.217 --> 34:43.552
from Jack and Lisa first,

34:43.619 --> 34:46.655
but I think we can
get them on board.

34:46.722 --> 34:48.556
What do you think?

34:49.491 --> 34:51.792

a granite countertop?

36:06.897 --> 36:08.397
I was thinking...

36:08.465 --> 36:11.333
back when we used
to perform on the circuit,

36:11.401 --> 36:13.401
just before
they'd announce our names

36:13.469 --> 36:15.671
over the loudspeaker,

36:15.739 --> 36:17.139
Chaplin...

36:18.408 --> 36:20.609
He'd raise his head up
so high.

36:20.677 --> 36:22.745
He was so proud.

36:22.812 --> 36:23.779
He just wanted
to go out there

36:23.846 --> 36:26.281
and entertain the crowd.

36:26.348 --> 36:27.348
You were right;

36:27.416 --> 36:29.717
I can't take that away
from him.

36:29.785 --> 36:31.386
Well, if that's what
you want me to do,

36:31.453 --> 36:33.254
I'll make some calls.

36:34.690 --> 36:35.790
But Sandra,
I think that Chaplin

36:35.857 --> 36:38.426
already has
the perfect owner.

36:38.494 --> 36:40.194
I told you,
I can't.

36:40.262 --> 36:41.328
It's been three years

36:41.396 --> 36:44.698
since I've done
any trick riding.

36:44.766 --> 36:46.132
I've never done it alone.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.402
But you're not gonna
be alone.

36:48.469 --> 36:49.670
This whole time,

36:49.737 --> 36:52.372
Chaplin's been right there
with you.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.841
You guys need each other.

36:55.810 --> 36:59.211
Come on, Sandra,
don't let him go.

37:04.050 --> 37:05.150
(Hammering)

37:12.625 --> 37:15.760
Tell me again why you're putting
a lock on the outside, Jack?

37:15.828 --> 37:18.630
Well, keeps the critters out
when nobody's using it.

37:18.698 --> 37:20.564
The last thing you want
is an angry badger

37:20.632 --> 37:22.333
growling at you
in the middle of the night,

37:22.400 --> 37:24.267
especially
if you really gotta go.

37:24.336 --> 37:26.603
(Laughs)
I guess so.

37:26.671 --> 37:28.439
Thanks for all your help.

37:28.506 --> 37:30.240
You're pretty handy
with the tools.

37:30.308 --> 37:31.809
Yeah, my pleasure.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.711
I, uh, have to be honest
with you,

37:33.778 --> 37:36.079
it's uh...
It was good practice

37:36.147 --> 37:37.647
'cause...

37:37.715 --> 37:40.616
Well, Lou and I are thinking
about building our own place,

37:40.684 --> 37:44.119
um, possibly out
by the dude ranch.

37:44.187 --> 37:45.355
Is that a fact?

37:45.422 --> 37:47.289
Yeah, now, now...
only if you're on board.

37:47.358 --> 37:48.624
Obviously.

37:48.692 --> 37:50.693
I mean, it's your call,
I understand.

37:50.761 --> 37:53.127
It's your property.

37:53.195 --> 37:55.397
It is now,
but it won't be forever.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.101
So uh...

38:00.169 --> 38:02.337
What do you think?

38:02.405 --> 38:06.040
I think it's... inevitable.

38:06.108 --> 38:07.776
You and Lou need
your own space,

38:07.844 --> 38:09.009
and if that's your dream,

38:09.077 --> 38:11.211
I won't stand in your way.

38:11.279 --> 38:12.680
(Laughs)

38:14.048 --> 38:15.783
That is great news
thanks.

38:15.851 --> 38:17.117
Thank you.

38:17.185 --> 38:18.519
Thank you very much,
Jack, man.

38:18.587 --> 38:21.422
Wow! I mean we're real
excited about it.

38:21.490 --> 38:23.858
We got a nice little space
picked out there.

38:23.925 --> 38:24.991
It's gonna be perfect.

38:25.058 --> 38:26.893
Oh, I'm sure it will be.

38:26.960 --> 38:28.060
New baby,

38:28.128 --> 38:29.863
a huge do-it-yourself
project,

38:29.930 --> 38:31.798
a wife with extremely
high expectations...

38:31.866 --> 38:35.034
What could possibly
go wrong?

38:35.102 --> 38:36.302
(Laughing)

38:37.337 --> 38:38.405
Right.
(Laughing)

38:46.513 --> 38:47.780
Amy:
Well, you ready?

38:47.847 --> 38:49.648
Sandra:
As ready as I'll ever gonna be.

38:51.885 --> 38:53.218
All right Chaplin.

38:53.319 --> 38:56.487
Let's do this
before I change my mind.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.294

39:07.900 --> 39:09.967

39:28.820 --> 39:31.387
Amy: That was absolutely
unbelievable!

39:31.455 --> 39:33.356
You guys are amazing.

for a shower,

42:05.711 --> 42:07.612
don't you think?

42:07.680 --> 42:09.814
Well, it was kind of
a late night.

42:09.882 --> 42:11.082
Yes, it was.

42:11.150 --> 42:12.683
Which, by the way,
will never happen again.

42:12.751 --> 42:14.285
No, it won't.

42:14.353 --> 42:15.420
I promise.

42:15.487 --> 42:17.688
And you've been
slacking off.

42:17.756 --> 42:19.190
So get your ducks in a row,

42:19.258 --> 42:22.026
starting with a double
shift today.

42:22.961 --> 42:24.028
Yes, sir.

42:25.431 --> 42:27.397
And a new rule:

42:27.465 --> 42:30.500
Anyone staying in the loft,
namely you,

42:30.568 --> 42:31.935
showers outdoors.

42:32.002 --> 42:34.671
There's a perfectly
good garden hose.

42:34.738 --> 42:36.206
Come on, Jack.

42:36.274 --> 42:39.543
Or there's always the pond
if you can stomach the leeches.

42:39.610 --> 42:40.743
And, for everything else,

42:40.811 --> 42:41.878
the facilities
you're looking for

42:41.946 --> 42:44.947
are located just past
the garden.

42:45.014 --> 42:46.915
I get it,
you're punishing me.

42:46.983 --> 42:49.151
(Laughs)
Oh... no.

42:49.219 --> 42:51.720
No, I haven't started
to punish you yet.

42:57.527 --> 43:00.161
Okay, my girl,
what do you think?

43:00.229 --> 43:01.829
This is where
you're gonna live.

43:01.897 --> 43:04.232
Daddy's gonna build you
a house.

43:04.300 --> 43:07.235
You sure daddy knows
what he's doing?

43:07.303 --> 43:08.769
What?

43:08.837 --> 43:10.271
I thought you were
excited about this?

43:10.339 --> 43:11.272
I am.

43:11.340 --> 43:12.873
But six months from now

43:12.941 --> 43:14.576
I don't want to have
to call Mike Holmes.

43:14.643 --> 43:16.543

43:16.611 --> 43:18.678

Famous last words.

43:20.448 --> 43:23.217
You have to imagine it

43:23.284 --> 43:24.851
