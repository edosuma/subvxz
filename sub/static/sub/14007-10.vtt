00:01.230 --> 00:03.030
Previously on damages...

00:03.070 --> 00:05.100
The firm is being
investigated by the fbi?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.200
I'm afraid so.

00:06.230 --> 00:07.810
The bureau's putting together a case.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.910
We'll use you to monitor
it from the inside.

00:09.940 --> 00:12.340
Why is there no record of all
the reports we've submitted?

00:12.370 --> 00:14.530
The investigation is
strictly need-to-know.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.560
Pam, you can't do this.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.760
His wife's leaving him.

00:17.790 --> 00:20.750
Energy secretary has a heart
attack at his own wedding.

00:20.780 --> 00:21.780
Install an ally.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.530
We're leaning in a
different direction now.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.640
- More conservative?
- More you.

00:25.650 --> 00:30.400
Finn garrety devices formulas
for speculating on energy futures.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.380
Kendrick could be using him to
manipulate the energy market.

00:34.410 --> 00:38.560
Our firm was hired to do
toxicity studies on aracite.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.320
- Is it toxic?
- Extremely.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.770
Claire maddox--
I've heard of her.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.340
She's head counsel of the world's
third largest energy provider.

00:45.370 --> 00:48.560
You need to decide. Are
you going to settle or not?

00:48.570 --> 00:52.350
I'm concerned about what's
going on between you and wes.

00:53.450 --> 00:56.620
Ellen parsons is getting
closer. Take her out.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.260
Thanks for meeting me. I...

01:09.300 --> 01:12.670
I'm sorry to leave
without saying good-bye.

01:16.930 --> 01:20.710
I've seen that look
before. That's regret.

01:21.330 --> 01:25.700
No. No, no. I don't
regret anything. I just...

01:26.540 --> 01:29.050
it's just all a little confusing.

01:29.070 --> 01:30.840
Yeah.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.990
It's hard to know...

01:35.020 --> 01:37.320
what I...

01:38.510 --> 01:39.740
owe david.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.150
And what you owe yourself.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.700
Yeah.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.510
You, um...

01:51.000 --> 01:53.320
you want to get away from here?

01:53.340 --> 01:56.060
My buddy-- he's
got a cabin upstate.

01:56.090 --> 01:58.820
We could go this weekend.

02:00.710 --> 02:04.040
I think I need to sort
a few things out first.

02:10.150 --> 02:12.680
Take as much time as you need.

02:13.010 --> 02:15.880
You know where to find me.

02:19.460 --> 02:21.570
Thanks, wes.

02:25.550 --> 02:28.860
The bureau has been on
patty hewes's ass for years.

02:29.210 --> 02:31.990
Why can't we find one
goddamned thing she did wrong?

02:32.020 --> 02:35.150
And how did we drop the ball
on the infant mortality case?

02:35.470 --> 02:37.570
We didn'T.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.230
Someone must have tipped him off.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.780
Oh, shit. It's pam.

02:46.580 --> 02:49.010
- What?
- are you alone?

02:49.020 --> 02:50.280
No.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.790
Well, we need to meet.

02:51.830 --> 02:56.740
Well, so, choose a day next
week, and let's be done with it.

02:56.750 --> 03:01.350
- How about tuesday?
- Fine. We'll meet tuesday.

03:05.530 --> 03:06.370
bitch.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.590
I'm worried about you, bro.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.340
It should not take that long
to wrap up a divorce settlement.

03:12.350 --> 03:16.560
You gave her the car, the kid, the
apartment. What else does she want?

03:18.180 --> 03:21.830
Hey, you're welcome to stay
here as long as you need to.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.890
But for your own sanity... listen to me.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.320
For your own sanity,
handle your business.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.810
Get this thing over with. You
deserve to start your life again.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.290
********

03:39.730 --> 03:44.640
So, it's just the two
of us... face-to-face.

03:46.410 --> 03:48.900
Just the two of us.

03:51.180 --> 03:54.630
It looks like you're not going
to tell me the truth after all.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.160
You'd better not screw this shit up.

03:58.870 --> 04:01.120
That's okay.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.640
I lied, too.

04:52.530 --> 04:55.920
What's happening with the
ultima national case right now?

04:55.950 --> 05:00.200
Patty's suing on behalf of the shareholders,
but she's not really interested in that.

05:00.210 --> 05:01.850
Why not?

05:01.900 --> 05:05.780
She thinks the unr merger is
about an energy trading scheme.

05:05.790 --> 05:06.930
What does that mean?

05:06.960 --> 05:12.460
It means that unr is using their consolidated
power to manipulate energy prices for profit.

05:12.470 --> 05:14.390
Well, can patty prove that?

05:14.430 --> 05:17.780
- No, but that's a a good thing.
- Why?

05:18.960 --> 05:22.120
Because I think she's getting desperate.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.540
You're being considered
for energy secretary?

05:25.600 --> 05:27.310
Well, I'm on the short list.

05:27.340 --> 05:29.920
Don't get too excited.
He still has to be vetted.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.940
out come the skeletons.

05:32.950 --> 05:34.950
Well, I should know
by the end of the week.

05:34.970 --> 05:37.320
So, when are you expecting
to hear back from colleges?

05:37.350 --> 05:40.240
Bill whittington heard
from harvard yesterday.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.820
- And?
- Rejected.

05:42.830 --> 05:46.910
Class valedictorian.
All fives on six aps.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.400
And he volunteers at a homeless
shelter on the weekends.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.420
Why haven't you heard back yet?

05:52.440 --> 05:56.330
The-the letters just started coming
out. I should be getting one any day.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.900
Cory, sit.

05:59.910 --> 06:03.040
How about this girlfriend of yours?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.980
Has she been accepted anywhere?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.850
What difference does it make?

06:07.880 --> 06:09.740
I was just asking.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.680
When are we finally
going to get to meet her?

06:11.690 --> 06:13.560
Yeah. Why all the secrecy?

06:13.840 --> 06:19.810
No secrecy. I just didn't want you guys
to meet her until I knew we were serious.

06:19.820 --> 06:24.340
That's fair enough.
Whenever you're ready.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.080
You know what? I think I'm ready.

06:28.090 --> 06:31.110
Good. How's dinner friday?

06:31.480 --> 06:34.250
Great.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.900
Do we have an energy secretary yet?

06:39.930 --> 06:44.560
Yes, but we want to vet him
before we announce it in the press.

06:44.580 --> 06:47.700
- Who is he?
- Phil grey.

06:49.180 --> 06:50.690
Patty hewes' husband?

06:50.740 --> 06:55.460
I thought it would be to our advantage to
create a conflict of interest in her household.

06:56.730 --> 07:00.280
you have one set of swinging hog
balls, dave. I got to hand it to you.

07:00.290 --> 07:03.030
Don't hand me anything yet.

07:03.070 --> 07:07.650
This lawsuit with patty hewes
has been going on way too long.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.520
I tried to get her to back off, but
I think she needs a bigger incentive.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.430
Meaning what exactly?

07:13.460 --> 07:15.370
Settle the case.

07:15.420 --> 07:18.560
A big lump of cash may chase her away.

07:18.810 --> 07:20.760
I'm not settling.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.280
This is my company we're talking about.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.380
Is it?

07:27.650 --> 07:30.380
settle the case, walt.

07:33.320 --> 07:39.440
I remember the very day I brought claire in
to meet then ceo alan dupree for his approval.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.390
Mind you, these were the days
when I still needed approval.

07:44.510 --> 07:47.790
claire comes in and dazzles.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.880
It was the best
interview I've ever seen.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.950
But I'll never forget what the
old bastard said after she left.

07:52.990 --> 07:57.160
He turned to me and said,
"walt, she's a woman."

07:57.170 --> 08:01.730
I said, "shit, alan, is
that what they call it?"

08:02.230 --> 08:07.960
and I told him, "alan, i guarantee, if
we make her an offer today, in 20 years,

08:08.000 --> 08:11.060
we'll be taking marching
orders from her."

08:11.110 --> 08:14.540
And here we are, claire, 20 years later.

08:14.550 --> 08:19.810
Alan dupree is living off a golden parachute
in scottsdale, and you're still flying high.

08:19.820 --> 08:22.940
To claire.

08:25.740 --> 08:28.480
well, I just want to thank
everybody for coming out tonight.

08:28.540 --> 08:33.789
I love this company, and, uh,
I've loved my last 20 years,

08:33.799 --> 08:36.830
and I'm looking forward to another 20.

08:37.299 --> 08:40.679
We know that I'm only here
because of your belief in me, walt,

08:40.720 --> 08:44.169
and, uh, I think all of us know that.

08:44.210 --> 08:48.130
That your belief in us and the company
and your integrity is just astounding.

08:48.170 --> 08:51.210
So, let's hear it for walt.

08:57.060 --> 08:59.460
James Claire, it was a nice party.

08:59.490 --> 09:02.400
Dad, you're leaving already?

09:02.440 --> 09:06.540
Yeah. I made plans to meet any old
army pal. I never get to see him.

09:07.850 --> 09:11.580
Okay. well, how are you getting there?

09:12.030 --> 09:13.920
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.710
My driver can take you, james.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.960
I'd like to walk a bit.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.600
Thanks for coming, dad.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.110
At least he showed. That says something.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.450
Really? What's that?

09:33.690 --> 09:36.440
- You mind a bit of business?
- Please.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.950
About this patty hewes case--
I think it's time to settle.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.630
I don't understand. The stocks are
recovering. Her case has no merit.

09:44.640 --> 09:48.140
Ah, just settle it. You can
go as high as 50 million.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.690
But you said there was going
to be an influx of capital.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.910
There's no reason why
the company or your...

09:51.960 --> 09:56.010
Claire, I've made my decision.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.640
Man's inconsolable loneliness.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.440
Bereft. Forsaken. Wretched.

10:07.450 --> 10:10.880
Uh, speaking of retching,
I think I may have to.

10:11.490 --> 10:13.140
This guy's a complete fraud.

10:13.190 --> 10:14.590
Tanya, I need your help.

10:14.630 --> 10:17.220
- Yeah, okay.
- Now!

10:18.160 --> 10:19.920
I got to go.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.890
Hey, did you hear from any colleges yet?

10:21.930 --> 10:24.420
Nope, not yet.

10:24.430 --> 10:27.060
Do you want to hit up
delaney's party tonight?

10:27.080 --> 10:28.890
Absolutely.

10:28.930 --> 10:30.800
Uh, did you bring those
sketches you were working on?

10:30.880 --> 10:33.510
I want you to see them, but
they're not finished yet.

10:33.520 --> 10:34.900
Why not?

10:34.940 --> 10:39.280
In order to make sense, they
need tire tracks over them.

10:39.310 --> 10:42.210
Preferably from my mom's stretch limo.

10:42.220 --> 10:45.730
- Can I drive it?
- Yeah, sure.

10:50.870 --> 10:53.760
Here, take this, and stop socializing.

10:55.150 --> 10:58.310
So, you going to keep up with
the brother of steel today?

10:58.320 --> 11:00.480
Probably not.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.990
I forgot my I.D.

11:17.110 --> 11:21.830
Hey, pam, you got to cut this shit
out now. You're the one that left him.

11:22.370 --> 11:25.190
Who is this?

11:30.090 --> 11:33.120
1010 wins said the upper
level of the gw was jammed,

11:33.160 --> 11:34.450
so I breezed right
through the lincoln tunnel.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.600
Mom, leave it. There's maid service.

11:36.610 --> 11:40.050
I'm halfway done. Hospital
corners are my specialty.

11:40.960 --> 11:43.480
I saw mrs. Moran at pathmark yesterday.

11:43.530 --> 11:44.820
Oh, yeah? You two still at war?

11:44.830 --> 11:47.270
No, we buried the hatchet a month ago.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.910
- She asked me what sort of case you were working on.
- Mom.

11:49.920 --> 11:52.250
And, of course, i didn't
know what to tell her.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.830
You don't have to tell her anythinG.

11:53.870 --> 11:56.690
People ask me about your
work, and I can't answer.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.240
It's embarrassing.

11:58.280 --> 11:59.850
Work is work. It's fine.

11:59.860 --> 12:03.130
Well, your sister works hard.
She comes by every sunday.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.020
- Yeah, I know.
- Don't take a tone.

12:05.030 --> 12:06.900
I'm not taking a tone.

12:09.010 --> 12:10.850
Look, I don't want to fight, ellie.

12:10.890 --> 12:12.170
I'm just worried about you.

12:12.200 --> 12:15.230
Mom, why don't we talk about this at
breakfast? 'Cause I'm going to be late.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.700
- Ellen, look at me.
- What? I'm fine.

12:22.390 --> 12:24.800
David was your best friend.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.930
How can you be fine without him?

12:26.970 --> 12:28.240
I mean, who do you confide in now?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.940
Because you're certainly not
sharing with your father and me.

12:30.980 --> 12:35.020
I... I... I go to counseling sometimes.

12:35.520 --> 12:38.430
You think I don't understand you.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.970
Ever since you were a kid, everyone thought
you had the world in the palm of your hand.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.630
Smart, pretty. Straight a'S.

12:46.640 --> 12:51.270
But I could always see when you weren't
happy, when you were holding something inside.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.990
I can see that now.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.040
You wanted to see me?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.240
You were late again today.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.000
I know, I'm sorry. It
was breakfast with my mom.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.790
It's hard to get her to stop talking.

13:04.820 --> 13:08.320
Live your life on your
own time, not mine.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.450
It won't happen again. Anything else?

13:11.460 --> 13:14.400
Are you close to your mother?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.660
Not really.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.340
She has a hard time
understanding my life.

13:22.370 --> 13:25.550
Well, you can always talk to me, ellen.

13:26.270 --> 13:29.340
- Thanks, patty.
- Hold on a minute.

13:30.240 --> 13:33.220
Shut the door. Sit down.

13:42.170 --> 13:48.330
I know that michael likes talking
to you when he comes to the office.

13:49.580 --> 13:52.800
Yeah, we've chatted a few times.

13:52.830 --> 13:55.720
Has he mentioned his girlfriend?

13:56.250 --> 14:00.150
No. Never. Why?

14:00.760 --> 14:05.530
He'S... he's been so secretive.

14:06.450 --> 14:12.950
We're finally going to meet her, but I was
thinking, if he talked to you about her or...

14:12.980 --> 14:15.950
No, he hasn't mentioned her, but...

14:15.990 --> 14:19.870
I mean, he's a teenager. He's probably
more nervous about it than you are.

14:21.570 --> 14:24.430
When did you introduce
david to your parents?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.720
- Oh, that was easy.
- Why?

14:27.270 --> 14:31.450
He was premed, responsible, honest.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.430
Yeah, my parents were thrilled.

14:37.820 --> 14:40.820
I got to get back to work.

14:43.750 --> 14:49.370
So, what are we thinking?
Schizoid? Skinhead? Scientologist?

14:49.380 --> 14:53.800
Well, if she has piercings
or a tattoo, I'm walking out.

14:55.180 --> 15:00.080
Mom, phil... I'd like
you to meet jill burnham.

15:00.090 --> 15:02.200
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

15:02.210 --> 15:06.200
Michael's told me so much about you.
I'm so glad we could finally meet.

15:06.490 --> 15:09.100
It's my pleasure.

15:09.320 --> 15:12.250
Have a seat, please.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.400
This place was a great choice.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.600
I used to come here all the
time in my teaching days.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.620
Jill taught art history at columbia.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.320
And when was that?

15:26.350 --> 15:31.180
It was right after i got my
phd, so, uh... it was '88 to '92.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.950
You okay over by the window?

15:35.000 --> 15:38.500
- Jill's just getting over a cold.
- I'm fine. Thank you.

15:41.410 --> 15:44.350
So, how did you two meet?

15:44.380 --> 15:47.010
Jill owns a gallery in chelsea.

15:47.060 --> 15:49.450
Some really interesting work.

15:49.610 --> 15:52.300
You two should come
down and check it out.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.090
We'd love to.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.050
We still have that wall
to fill in the guest room.

16:06.080 --> 16:09.050
You know what I love on a
chilly night is a nice barolo.

16:09.080 --> 16:13.100
Excuse me. Could we have a
bottle of the '99 reserve?

16:13.110 --> 16:14.040
Four glasses.

16:14.050 --> 16:18.040
Absolutely not. You are 18.

16:22.650 --> 16:26.230
So, jill... do you have children?

16:33.980 --> 16:36.470
How has retirement been?

16:37.090 --> 16:38.900
Quiet.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.820
Quiet's good.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.640
Most of the time.

16:45.380 --> 16:49.990
Of course, it wouldn't be so
quiet if I had some grandchildren.

16:51.900 --> 16:56.680
You know, if you wanted grandkids, dad, you
should have had more than one kid yourself.

16:56.720 --> 17:00.190
It was a bad idea to put
all your eggs in one basket.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.610
Your mother didn't want any more.

17:02.650 --> 17:05.210
- That's 'cause she was depressed.
- That's nonsense.

17:05.220 --> 17:07.520
What do you know? You were
overseas most of the time.

17:07.530 --> 17:09.890
I knew her, claire.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.800
Don't try to tell me I didn't know her.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.920
Well, I had to live with her,
and she was depressed, because,

17:15.950 --> 17:19.589
instead of going out into the world and
accomplishing something, she had to raise me.

17:34.370 --> 17:37.630
I'm sorry you don't
have grandchildren, dad.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.820
I truly am.

17:41.870 --> 17:44.270
I guess there just wasn't enough time.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.380
Time?

17:45.440 --> 17:49.240
You know, the irony of this is that you're
the one who pushed me to go to law school.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.410
Time doesn't have anything to do with
it. Either you want kids or you don'T.

17:52.420 --> 17:56.650
I'm the lead counsel for one of the
biggest energy companies in the world.

17:56.690 --> 17:59.000
You know how many women can say that?

17:59.010 --> 18:01.530
One. Me.

18:04.470 --> 18:06.720
Yeah.

18:08.870 --> 18:12.650
But what do you have to
look forward to, claire?

18:18.260 --> 18:21.110
I have to get back to work.

18:21.380 --> 18:24.390
thank you for coming
in town for my party.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.620
You're leaving?

18:25.680 --> 18:30.090
Yes, dad, and please don't
have another glass of wine.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.990
See you, dad.

18:41.890 --> 18:44.460
Since when did you start smoking?

18:46.000 --> 18:49.320
Try getting a divorce.

18:51.800 --> 18:54.620
I answered your phone the other day.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.080
Why did you do that?

18:56.140 --> 18:59.160
Caller id said pam
werner was on the phone.

18:59.170 --> 19:01.870
I wanted to get her to back off for you.

19:01.940 --> 19:05.800
Imagine my surprise when i picked it
up and there was a man on the line.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.870
It's probably the new guy she's seeing.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.300
Some real estate douche bag.

19:11.330 --> 19:14.440
Keeps threatening me
about pam's alimony.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.630
I spoke to pam.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.100
She's not seeing anyone.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.850
She told me she was.

19:27.650 --> 19:29.970
Stop lying.

19:30.030 --> 19:32.990
Pam said she hadn't
spoken to you in months.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.180
Now, why don't you just tell
me what the hell is going on.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.140
Come on, randy.

19:43.170 --> 19:45.560
Don't give me that shit.

19:45.590 --> 19:48.370
Who was on the goddamned phone?

19:55.840 --> 19:58.950
I... I don't know his name.

19:59.610 --> 20:02.190
Is he from the bureau?

20:02.200 --> 20:07.400
Look, he'S... it's just some guy
who has an interest in our case.

20:07.410 --> 20:10.820
He wants patty hewes taken
down as badly as we do.

20:11.690 --> 20:13.170
What's your arrangement?

20:13.200 --> 20:15.710
From time to time, he...

20:15.740 --> 20:20.380
he pays me a little something just to let
him know where the investigation stands.

20:21.130 --> 20:25.920
I'm broke, randy. I have
alimony. I have child support.

20:26.550 --> 20:29.470
Okay, hang on, hang on, hang on.

20:30.950 --> 20:34.050
I'll talk to him. I'll
have him cut you in.

20:34.060 --> 20:37.330
All right, I'll get you
the same deal that I got.

20:39.160 --> 20:43.540
It's just more money to do
exactly what we're doing anyway.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.700
- He hasn't asked you for anything else?
- Nothing.

20:52.350 --> 20:56.160
Think about it. Please.

21:09.780 --> 21:12.680
I got some of the oolong
you like from mcnulty'S.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.130
No, thanks.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.960
Last night meant a lot to me.

21:28.350 --> 21:31.540
Of course, I was
surprised at first, but...

21:31.550 --> 21:35.970
I'm glad you felt comfortable
enough to introduce us to jill.

21:35.980 --> 21:39.990
She's become a big part of my life.

21:44.830 --> 21:50.430
When I was growing up, parents rarely had
that kind of relationship with their kids.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.930
My...

21:52.980 --> 21:55.380
I am sure my father would never...

21:55.400 --> 21:57.860
It was a different era.

21:59.330 --> 22:04.290
Well, I hope you know if there's anything
you want to share with me, I'm here.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.020
Thanks.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.330
This isn't the tea I like.

22:21.990 --> 22:25.390
I'm authorized to offer a settlement.

22:26.940 --> 22:28.580
Are you amenable?

22:28.640 --> 22:30.500
Throw out a number. We'll see.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.500
Oh, no, i don't work that
way. It's a waste of time.

22:33.510 --> 22:37.800
I offer a number, you reject it, you offer a
number, I reject it, and on and on and on and on.

22:37.830 --> 22:40.040
It's so boring.

22:40.090 --> 22:44.180
Well, no one says it has
to be boring. Surprise me.

22:44.190 --> 22:48.310
Let's talk about why you're
really trying this case.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.270
You don't care about
our wounded shareholders.

22:51.330 --> 22:54.650
I don't? What do you think I care about?

22:54.660 --> 22:57.030
Daniel purcell.

22:57.060 --> 23:02.170
He embarrassed you. He flipped
on the stand. You want revenge.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.360
My boss doesn't understand that.

23:04.420 --> 23:09.750
He thinks that you're motivated by greed
like the rest of the world, but I get it.

23:10.150 --> 23:15.010
I get revenge, so I know that you don't
want to settle no matter what the price.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.840
That's very astute.

23:16.880 --> 23:20.370
Good, because I don't
want to settle either.

23:20.410 --> 23:23.120
See you in court.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.650
Can I ask you a question?

23:26.660 --> 23:28.380
Please.

23:28.430 --> 23:32.720
Why were you defending a
hooker on a cocaine charge?

23:33.360 --> 23:35.420
Because she needed a lawyer.

23:35.430 --> 23:38.060
Why didn't finn garrety need a lawyer?

23:38.110 --> 23:42.180
Finn garrety? I don't
believe I know who that is.

23:42.930 --> 23:46.950
Well, mention that name to your boss,

23:46.960 --> 23:51.520
and whatever settlement figure he's
authorized, tell him to triple it.

23:54.040 --> 23:57.750
And we'll start boring
each other from there.

23:59.410 --> 24:01.630
So what happened with patty hewes?

24:01.680 --> 24:04.780
She told me to triple the offer.

24:06.360 --> 24:10.170
Don't bother countering.
She'll come back to us.

24:10.180 --> 24:14.530
No, walt, she's not going to settle.

24:16.900 --> 24:23.620
She asked me about the
prostitute that you had me defend.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.650
We have nothing to worry about.
She can't hurt me with that.

24:26.660 --> 24:30.330
Can she hurt you with finn garrety?

24:31.640 --> 24:34.480
Who is he, walt?

24:35.930 --> 24:38.850
No one important.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.210
It wasn't your prostitute, was it?

24:50.370 --> 24:52.100
you compromised me.

24:52.180 --> 24:55.010
You had me go into patty hewes'
office without all the facts.

24:55.050 --> 24:56.760
- Claire...
- No.

24:56.770 --> 24:59.370
I want to know what's going on.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.750
Otherwise I'll go right back to my office
and I will type up a letter of resignation.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.680
Take it easy, okay?

25:05.730 --> 25:07.390
Your father's in town; the
stress is getting to you.

25:07.450 --> 25:10.170
There's no reason to be paranoid.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.650
Tell me.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.030
Finn garrety is the son of a friend.

25:21.060 --> 25:24.000
He made a stupid mistake
and got himself into trouble.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.850
So you lied to me.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.620
I'm sorry, claire.

25:30.570 --> 25:34.040
I was just trying to protect a
friend. That's all there is to it.

25:47.660 --> 25:50.860
You have one new message.

25:50.870 --> 25:52.740
Hey, it's katie.

25:52.750 --> 25:56.600
You're probably alone in your
hotel, working or just going to bed.

25:56.630 --> 26:00.670
So why don't you come out for
a change? I'll buy you a drink.

26:07.590 --> 26:11.290
Ellen. I thought there was no
way that you were going to come.

26:11.300 --> 26:13.720
Well, here I am.

26:29.650 --> 26:32.050
The staring has got to stop.

26:32.060 --> 26:35.640
If you're going to look at me all
night, at least you can talk to me.

26:35.940 --> 26:39.730
do you have something to say
or are you just window-shopping?

26:39.740 --> 26:42.840
Um, I'm moving to
chicago in the morning.

26:42.860 --> 26:45.300
This is a big night for you, huh?

26:45.320 --> 26:47.770
Last night in new york-- you
want to make it memorable?

26:47.790 --> 26:48.960
Sure, why not?

26:49.010 --> 26:53.410
If I asked you back to
my hotel with me tonight,

26:53.420 --> 26:56.430
would that be something
that you might remember?

26:57.240 --> 26:59.210
Probably.

26:59.230 --> 27:02.300
This is what people do, right?

27:02.340 --> 27:07.130
They go out, they get
drunk, they hook up.

27:07.140 --> 27:11.790
So what do you say? Would
you like another round?

27:11.800 --> 27:14.030
Sure.

27:26.550 --> 27:30.620
Thank you for meeting me so late.

27:31.130 --> 27:33.520
You said you needed my help.

27:33.550 --> 27:39.650
A couple weeks ago, walter kendrick asks me
to defend a prostitute on cocaine charges.

27:41.730 --> 27:45.260
the john's name was finn garrety.

27:45.270 --> 27:46.440
I don't know that name.

27:46.480 --> 27:50.730
I did some research. Turns out
he's a big player on wall street.

27:50.740 --> 27:53.990
He trades energy futures.

27:57.090 --> 28:02.470
Since the merger...
I've been watching unr.

28:02.890 --> 28:04.230
And?

28:04.280 --> 28:08.970
They've had some unusual power
outages across the country.

28:08.980 --> 28:13.330
I was told that too much energy demand
was placing a strain on the grid.

28:13.340 --> 28:18.700
Maybe. But what if someone at unr
was purposely shutting off the supply?

28:18.710 --> 28:21.480
The price of energy would go right up.

28:23.640 --> 28:28.600
If walter kendrick is leaking information
about the timing of the shutdown,

28:28.650 --> 28:31.480
an energy trader would know
exactly when to place a bet.

28:31.550 --> 28:34.110
They'd make a fortune.

28:34.820 --> 28:39.100
If kendrick got caught, he'd go to
prison. He-he'd lose the company.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.950
He'd never do it.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.280
It's way too big a risk.

28:45.340 --> 28:49.410
I know how you feel about him.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.350
He has been good to you.

28:52.370 --> 28:56.540
He made your career, but he
is not the man you think he is.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.530
Whatever happened that night in
your house with your wife is over.

29:01.570 --> 29:06.650
It's done with. This
is a partnership now.

29:06.660 --> 29:09.600
You have my word.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.520
What are you talking about?

29:14.530 --> 29:16.880
Aracite is toxic.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.500
The final report said that it was safe.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.440
Kendrick had the report doctored.

29:20.470 --> 29:21.860
Then why'd you testify on his behalf?

29:21.910 --> 29:24.790
Because I cut a deal with him.

29:26.130 --> 29:32.210
If I certified that aracite was harmless,
kendrick promised he would clean it up.

29:34.050 --> 29:37.720
I have nothing to gain
by lying to you, claire.

29:37.730 --> 29:40.450
Ask kendrick...

29:40.500 --> 29:46.890
if aracite is toxic. If he denies
it, you know you can't trust him.

29:57.880 --> 30:00.110
You want another drink?

30:00.140 --> 30:01.870
'Cause I have a minibar.

30:01.900 --> 30:06.440
No, no, no, I-i think-- uh-uh--
I think you have had enough.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.610
No, come on, just one more.

30:09.630 --> 30:13.370
Nope, go to bed. I'm
gonna get you some water.

30:18.790 --> 30:22.030
- Ellen, what is it?
- I'm so sorry.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.900
It's okay, it's, it's
okay. Lay down, sweetie.

30:28.330 --> 30:32.320
I can'T... I can't
talk to anyone, katie.

30:33.060 --> 30:36.700
You can. You can talk to me.

30:36.710 --> 30:39.940
You don't understand.

30:39.950 --> 30:44.630
Ellen, I think you need to
take some time to yourself.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.980
I can'T.

30:47.030 --> 30:50.640
Maybe you shouldn't be
working for patty right now.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.250
I'm not really working for patty.

30:57.960 --> 31:00.670
What?

31:00.710 --> 31:05.910
Ellen, you're drunk. Go to sleep.

31:11.110 --> 31:13.570
I'm sorry I pushed you the other day.

31:13.580 --> 31:15.100
Don't worry about it.

31:15.160 --> 31:19.650
All I care about is being able to
protect the company and protect you.

31:19.700 --> 31:21.580
I get it, claire.

31:23.020 --> 31:26.740
Good, because there's something
else we need to talk about.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.790
- What's that?
- Aracite.

31:29.800 --> 31:35.300
I was looking over the documents that
daniel purcell leaked to patty hewes.

31:35.310 --> 31:36.640
What for?

31:36.670 --> 31:40.270
Well, it always bothered me
that he flipped on the stand.

31:40.280 --> 31:45.740
His original research states

31:45.750 --> 31:48.490
that aracite is highly toxic.

31:49.420 --> 31:52.440
He was wrong and he admitted it.

31:52.450 --> 31:55.840
So there's nothing we
need to worry about.

31:56.980 --> 32:00.710
There's nothing we need to
clean up in west virginia?

32:00.720 --> 32:03.810
I'm telling you aracite is safe.

32:03.820 --> 32:08.640
Okay, because if there's anything in this that
can come back to haunt us ever, I need to know.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.480
No, you don'T.

32:10.530 --> 32:16.460
You just need to do your job and be my
goddamned lawyer and stop asking questions.

32:26.420 --> 32:29.100
What do you think?

32:29.540 --> 32:32.720
It's all right if you hate
it. It's not for everyone.

32:32.730 --> 32:35.330
No, it isn'T.

32:37.500 --> 32:40.340
I appreciate you making
time to come see me.

32:40.370 --> 32:43.950
I, I called because I
felt like we should talk.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.330
- May I ask you a question?
- Sure.

32:47.650 --> 32:51.620
You appear to be an
intelligent, attractive woman.

32:51.650 --> 32:54.480
Why are you dating a child?

32:54.490 --> 32:57.840
We both know that
michael is not a child.

32:57.850 --> 33:00.450
Are you mentally ill?

33:02.170 --> 33:05.090
I really think I understand
what's going on here.

33:05.140 --> 33:07.740
And, uh, it's not about me and michael.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.210
No?

33:09.250 --> 33:12.370
You're facing the
prospect of an empty nest,

33:12.380 --> 33:16.310
so you're clinging to this notion
that michael still needs you.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.890
And, I mean, I can
assure you he doesn'T.

33:22.640 --> 33:25.680
But you'll see--
that's a good thing.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.320
You will break his heart.

33:30.360 --> 33:34.650
And when you do--
I'll rip your face off.

33:37.530 --> 33:40.930
I have to get back to
work, but feel free to stay.

33:40.940 --> 33:46.480
And, uh, if you see anything you like,
I'll give you the family discount.

33:51.890 --> 33:54.360
He lied.

33:55.020 --> 33:59.390
thanks for these. I compared them.

33:59.400 --> 34:02.810
It's clear the final
report was doctored.

34:04.300 --> 34:06.050
I'm sorry, claire.

34:06.060 --> 34:11.179
He told me there was no reason to clean
up aracite, because aracite wasn't toxic.

34:11.190 --> 34:14.080
So he lied to both of us.

34:16.659 --> 34:21.110
I gave half of my life to
this man and his company.

34:21.120 --> 34:23.989
And it turns out he's a criminal.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.870
What are you going to do?

34:27.929 --> 34:31.100
I don't want to think
about it right now.

34:32.330 --> 34:34.770
I miss you.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.449
- You've been drinking.
- What do you care?

34:55.960 --> 34:58.740
I'm heading out.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.450
****

35:03.390 --> 35:05.870
- What?
- I think I want in.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.600
Oh, good.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.120
I'm going to want to
meet this guy first.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.490
I will set that up.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.950
All right.

35:17.390 --> 35:20.010
What, you-you-- you're going
out with the stewardess?

35:20.020 --> 35:21.860
Yeah, don't tell pam.

35:21.870 --> 35:25.660
Oh, shit, I won'T. Have fun, baby!

35:42.760 --> 35:45.220
Can I come in?

36:02.540 --> 36:05.470
That's not good--
you're back already?

36:18.790 --> 36:21.140
You leaving?

36:36.440 --> 36:39.790
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

36:40.270 --> 36:43.050
I have to tell you something.

36:43.060 --> 36:47.440
The first time we went
to the firing range, I...

36:48.170 --> 36:51.050
I told you something I
probably shouldn't have.

36:51.070 --> 36:53.560
You said someone tried to kill you.

36:53.860 --> 36:58.620
Yeah. It was my boss.

37:00.570 --> 37:03.260
Patty hewes?

37:03.270 --> 37:06.110
I knew...

37:06.130 --> 37:07.530
some things about her.

37:07.560 --> 37:13.420
And she got paranoid and
tried to get rid of me.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.110
That's insane.

37:18.140 --> 37:21.150
Why the hell are you
still working for her?

37:21.750 --> 37:24.410
I'm not.

37:24.420 --> 37:27.080
You lost me.

37:27.090 --> 37:28.530
I'm crazy to be telling you this.

37:28.570 --> 37:32.770
But I just feel like if
I don't talk about it,

37:32.780 --> 37:35.450
- I'm going to lose my mind.
- Tell me.

37:39.730 --> 37:43.290
Five months ago, i was
approached by the fbi.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.430
*******

37:47.170 --> 37:50.090
- Ellen.
- Mr. Nye.

37:50.100 --> 37:52.020
Get in the car.

37:52.030 --> 37:54.140
I'm agent harrison.
This is agent werner.

37:54.150 --> 37:58.080
They said they were investigating
patty hewes, and they...

37:59.140 --> 38:02.010
they asked me to be an informant.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.410
- And-and you
said... - Yes.

38:04.420 --> 38:06.520
Jesus.

38:06.530 --> 38:08.940
Thanks for the chat.

38:14.190 --> 38:17.090
How's that been for you?

38:19.860 --> 38:24.050
You can't imagine the toll it
takes when everyday is a lie.

38:38.660 --> 38:41.420
She met with someone in a limo.

38:43.150 --> 38:44.400
You got it.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.130
No. No, I can'T.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.750
Why is parsons still alive?

39:08.780 --> 39:11.160
Because I found out why she's
been meeting with the feds.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.010
What the hell is she doing?

39:13.080 --> 39:18.310
The fbi is using her as a cooperating
witness against patty hewes.

39:18.320 --> 39:20.940
That's all parsons
cares about right now.

39:20.980 --> 39:23.480
Taking down patty.

39:24.180 --> 39:26.210
Frobisher doesn't need protecting.

39:26.250 --> 39:30.420
This has got nothing to do with
protecting frobisher. You understand?

39:30.840 --> 39:33.930
This is about me.
Parsons knows too much.

39:33.940 --> 39:36.530
You're safe, rick.

39:36.550 --> 39:38.380
You have nothing to worry about.

39:38.420 --> 39:41.670
That's right. I don'T.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.950
'Cause you're going to do it.

39:44.970 --> 39:46.740
Or I call your old lieutenant.

39:46.750 --> 39:48.980
I tell him what I know.

39:49.020 --> 39:52.600
And I send you to prison for life.

40:00.930 --> 40:04.270
********

40:49.520 --> 40:53.120
You killed him, didn't you?

40:53.530 --> 40:57.210
From what I hear, the man was
a drug addict. It's a tragedy.

40:57.220 --> 41:00.410
You didn't have to do that, asshole.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.860
- He was going to play along.
- No.

41:02.870 --> 41:04.190
He was playing you.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.970
That is... that is bullshit,
and you know that's bullshit.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.540
He made a call to the deputy
director of the bureau.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.750
No. No, he wouldn't have done that.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.160
He reported you to the higher-ups.

41:19.640 --> 41:22.350
you don't have to worry.

41:22.380 --> 41:26.060
The deputy director knows i
have an interest in this case.

41:29.730 --> 41:32.590
Is my... my supervisor in on this?

41:32.600 --> 41:36.510
Of course he is. Now,
get me patty hewes.

41:42.840 --> 41:46.410
******

41:50.810 --> 41:54.430
So it seems like you're not going
to tell me the truth after all?

41:55.240 --> 41:58.100
You'd better not screw this shit up.

41:58.110 --> 42:00.290
That's okay.

42:01.630 --> 42:03.780
I lied, too.
