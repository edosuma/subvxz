00:33.701 --> 00:35.994
The aim could not be more true.

00:37.580 --> 00:42.418
If the tree line is the wall
and we are two arrow flights scarce,

00:42.501 --> 00:45.003
true aim does not matter, does it?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.798
We need to bring the engine closer.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.843
Bring it closer,
we will become pin cushions.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.056
We need a longer arm.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.308
Longer arm is bigger frame.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.186
Bigger frame is giant wheel.
Bigger rocks.

01:01.104 --> 01:03.522
You are making me to build a monster.

01:03.606 --> 01:06.192
You were the finest
engine builder in Damascus, no?

01:06.275 --> 01:07.318
Yes.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.027
Then build me a monster.

03:15.488 --> 03:18.324
The Cricket Minister
comes this way.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.826
His troops are mobilizing.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.705
War is upon us once again.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.001
Speak your decree, cousin.
It will be done.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.512
There's no need for decrees.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.681
Or sermons to rouse.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.643
We march...

03:46.644 --> 03:47.770
before they do.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.481
Go.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.441
By your will, Sire.

03:52.525 --> 03:56.404
And by the House of Ögödei,
I will lead your tumens.

03:56.487 --> 03:57.946
Praises, cousin.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.909
You will ride with
our tumens and my sons.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.996
I name you commander of 1,000 men.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.582
But I lead this assault.

04:08.666 --> 04:11.752
You ride with the House of Kublai.

04:15.631 --> 04:18.466
I am grateful for the honor, Khagan.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.556
But hear me, please, cousin.

04:24.723 --> 04:28.477
Twice my men and horses
have ridden under your banner.

04:28.561 --> 04:30.020
Twice my men...

04:31.397 --> 04:34.733
and two sons
have fallen to the Chinese.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.363
If I do not lead this next assault...

04:40.614 --> 04:43.116
my men will return north,
and I with them.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.412
Lord Kaidu, there's no need to rush.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.581
Let him rush.

04:48.664 --> 04:52.585
Let him rush home
to be king of his ger village.

04:53.586 --> 04:56.589
King of nomads and sheep.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.174
You mock nomads?

05:01.802 --> 05:03.261
You mock Genghis?

05:03.346 --> 05:06.349
I mock cowards, no one else.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.229
Confer with your astrologers, cousin.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.816
Confer with your Chinese monks,
your Taoist priests.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.194
Look to your Muslim imams
and all your prophets.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.990
How goes the Latin's
construction project?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.575
My understanding
from our engineers...

05:24.658 --> 05:26.118
My engineers!

05:28.078 --> 05:32.290
My understanding from
your engineers is that it is a gamble.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.835
- A fool's gamble!
- Mind your treason!

05:34.918 --> 05:36.169
Know this!

05:44.011 --> 05:49.057
As you lead your sons
back into the jaws of Sidao's China...

05:50.726 --> 05:55.689
I will march north to Karakorum
to defend the true Mongol capital.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.150
No one asked you to make a decree,

05:59.109 --> 06:03.781
yet you do so here
before the throne of the Khan of Khans?

06:03.864 --> 06:06.742
I do not need your horses, Kaidu!

06:08.160 --> 06:11.246
I do not need your House of Ögödei!

06:18.754 --> 06:20.589
Leave here.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.925
You are forever banished.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.291
Come with me.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.920
When I have avenged my father,
I will come and honor yours.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.673
Look for me, Khutulun.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.425
I will ride back
with many captured horses.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.602
Don't ride back with captured horses.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.395
Just ride back.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.496
Rise.

07:39.752 --> 07:44.297
Great Emperor, Triumphant Chancellor.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.885
The men of Suzhou are saddened
by the passing of the Empress.

07:47.968 --> 07:52.681
In honor of her memory,
I pledge 5,000 men to the Song army.

07:54.016 --> 07:58.103
The Governor of Suzhou.
Very important man.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.898
Richer in swordsmen
than he is in porcelain.

08:00.981 --> 08:05.443
And he has presented us
with much porcelain in recent years.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.321
Will 5,000 troops suffice?

08:09.907 --> 08:10.908
No!

08:12.075 --> 08:15.037
I will pledge 10,000 men,
my Sovereign.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.372
Ten thousand to
the great Song dynasty.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.959
His Benevolence
is most pleased, Governor.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.337
We thank you and pledge
expansion of your domain

08:24.421 --> 08:27.049
when the Mongol plague is removed.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.977
Pillow low, quilt is warm,

08:39.061 --> 08:42.147
body smooth and peaceful.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.109
Sun shines on the door,

08:46.193 --> 08:49.446
curtain not yet open.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.576
Before bonds and agreements
can be duly made,

08:53.659 --> 08:56.369
a test of virtue must be witnessed.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.332
If these royal matrons

09:00.415 --> 09:04.377
witness no blood
upon entry of the pigeon's egg,

09:04.461 --> 09:08.381
it is deemed that the prospective bride
has been defiled.

09:10.467 --> 09:14.304
Pillow low, quilt is warm,

09:14.387 --> 09:18.183
body smooth and peaceful.

09:18.266 --> 09:22.479
The water flows,
mind of its own.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.649
The birds return to perch.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.454
And when the test
has been made, if the chosen has...

09:39.537 --> 09:40.581
Enough, Judar.

10:14.865 --> 10:18.451
Thus... when the blood
is of proper nature,

10:18.535 --> 10:22.039
the bride is proclaimed a virgin,

10:22.122 --> 10:25.042
the pending marriage valid.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.252
So be it.

10:28.879 --> 10:33.050
Sorrow and happiness
are the heresies of virtue, child.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.970
As royalty,
you understand such formality.

11:08.877 --> 11:10.754
Meditation?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.008
I can sit for a count of 10

11:15.092 --> 11:18.470
before I start thinking of
all the things yet undone.

11:20.055 --> 11:23.350
How do Mongols
raise their girl children?

11:25.769 --> 11:28.772
You will never find
a more civilized queen,

11:28.856 --> 11:30.899
nor a more compassionate mother.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.195
But she is still a Mongol.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.742
And when it comes to
protecting her Khan and empire,

11:39.825 --> 11:41.952
she will do what needs to be done.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.746
As will I...

11:45.122 --> 11:47.916
for kindness shown to my child.

11:52.963 --> 11:55.215
It is said that a nobleman
once drowned himself

11:55.298 --> 11:57.300
after a night in your bedchamber,

11:57.384 --> 12:00.428
because there was
nothing left to live for.

12:02.014 --> 12:05.142
Tea house songs
have a way of growing into fables.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.645
There will be new songs
sung about you, Mei Lin.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.605
I hope not.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.483
You now long for anonymity?

12:15.360 --> 12:17.487
I think most do.

12:20.532 --> 12:22.284
The drums would disagree.

12:24.161 --> 12:28.791
Every set of beats
tells of the Khan's mandate.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.709
And what do they say this night?

12:33.003 --> 12:34.171
War.

12:44.306 --> 12:48.852
"Those skilled in warfare move
the enemy, and are not moved by the enemy.

12:51.354 --> 12:54.316
Get the enemy to approach
by his own accord.

12:55.233 --> 12:58.278
If he's at ease, exhaust him.

12:58.361 --> 13:02.365
Well fed, starve him.
Settled, move him."

13:03.867 --> 13:09.206
I never knew you gave much merit
to Sun Tzu's treatise on war.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.958
I don't.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.668
But the fat Mongol
is trying to become Chinese.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.087
Do not think for one moment

13:15.170 --> 13:17.214
that he will not
be consulting Sun Tzu's manual.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.675
So, if he expects us to attack,
why mobilize?

13:20.758 --> 13:24.179
To draw the Mongols out.
Kublai is sick with defeat.

13:24.262 --> 13:29.017
When he hears we are mobilizing,
he will return, weakened in numbers,

13:29.101 --> 13:30.894
and by pride.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.445
Will they work?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.197
Every day we find
the engines getting stronger...

13:42.280 --> 13:44.116
Will they work?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.409
By your will, Sire.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.412
And I will be ready to stand with them.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.831
We march whether
they are ready or not.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.252
Vice Regent Yusuf gave his life

13:55.335 --> 13:57.504
to give you this opportunity.
Remember that.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.343
I will avenge my brothers
who fell at Xiangyang.

14:03.426 --> 14:04.427
And should I fail...

14:04.511 --> 14:09.057
Should you fail, I will leave you
as carrion on the battlefield.

15:05.363 --> 15:09.159
I don't have much time
before Judar finds me missing.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.079
I need to know if you will follow me.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.663
Follow you?

15:16.166 --> 15:18.543
I am to be Prince Jingim's wife.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.465
We must run. Now.

15:29.179 --> 15:31.181
I cannot.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.559
Is leaving here with me not your wish?

15:47.948 --> 15:50.158
We run, as you say.

15:52.410 --> 15:57.290
We make it past the guards,
the gate, the mountains...

15:58.375 --> 16:01.378
and praise our good fortune
every day we awaken.

16:02.920 --> 16:08.385
Because there will not be a single night
in which we are fully certain

16:08.468 --> 16:11.763
that a Mongol blade
will not find us in our sleep.

16:13.015 --> 16:17.852
There is nothing beyond those walls
but doubt and fear.

16:17.935 --> 16:22.649
All we can change is here...
in this place.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.735
And how do you propose to do that?

16:25.818 --> 16:28.821
I must win this war for the Khan.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.824
And you think he will give me to you?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.411
Just like that?

16:36.329 --> 16:37.914
It's the only way.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.675
Do you desire a sip?
I believe you need one.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.097
I just need your good words.

17:40.935 --> 17:46.191
In one of my darkest hours,
cold and lost in the Wudang Mountains,

17:47.650 --> 17:52.072
my life was saved
by a small yellow bird.

17:54.282 --> 17:55.450
How?

17:55.533 --> 17:57.952
I caught it and ate it.

17:58.035 --> 18:02.207
That is a terrible story, Sifu,
in which I find no wisdom.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.337
Your destiny is sealed
by those machines.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.631
When you march south,

18:09.714 --> 18:12.300
if you take the wall,
you will be lauded.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.261
Should you fail,

18:15.052 --> 18:18.973
there is no other soul
to sacrifice in your place.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.058
There will be no such march, Sifu.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.646
Not for the Latin.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.565
And when I return from Xiangyang,

18:27.649 --> 18:30.402
he will be well on his way home
to his thief father.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.074
Defeat me now
and you can fight in this war.

18:37.159 --> 18:41.663
Lose... and you will ride
for Venice at first light.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.368
Enough.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.799
Avoid me on the field.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.979
Do you now desire that sip?

20:51.167 --> 20:53.670
The Empress has
warned me about you.

20:53.753 --> 20:56.548
I am certain she has.

20:58.633 --> 21:02.178
Do you think I would grant you
an audience with the Blue Princess?

21:02.262 --> 21:05.932
No. I have learned that lesson well.

21:06.849 --> 21:07.975
Clearly not.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.563
I leave tonight with the army.

21:12.814 --> 21:14.231
But I will return.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.196
I do not ask to see her.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.616
All I ask is that you deliver
something to her from me.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.704
This...

21:28.871 --> 21:30.290
is from the Silk Road...

21:31.333 --> 21:34.126
a place I hope to show her one day.

21:43.886 --> 21:46.097
The I Ching says this:

21:46.180 --> 21:50.768
"Attempt to seize all of China
and destruction will follow.

21:50.852 --> 21:52.812
The Silk Road you once opened

21:52.895 --> 21:56.399
will be overtaken by
a black cloud from the West,

21:56.483 --> 21:59.944
leaving nothing but weeds and nettles."

22:00.027 --> 22:02.071
You speak any more poetry, Priest,

22:02.154 --> 22:04.949
you'll be growing weeds and nettles
out of your dung hole.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.951
Mind your nature, husband.

22:08.160 --> 22:13.791
Your Most Benevolent and Holy Khan,
the I Ching tells no lies.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.377
Return war to the South

22:15.460 --> 22:18.087
and there may never be harmony

22:18.170 --> 22:22.133
between the heavenly and primal.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.944
You observe that?

22:42.028 --> 22:44.363
He looked at you
when he said "the heavenly."

22:44.447 --> 22:47.617
Why conscript these priests
and prophets into service

22:47.700 --> 22:48.910
if you do not heed their words?

22:48.993 --> 22:51.287
That priest is from South China.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.330
How do we know
he does not have grandchildren

22:53.415 --> 22:55.124
behind those walls down there?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.959
Hear me, Kublai.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.962
You have only half the men and horses
you had on the last march.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.213
Kaidu has gone north.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.674
Banished north.

23:02.757 --> 23:05.802
Your men are tired, uncertain.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.556
Another defeat will destroy the empire.

23:10.807 --> 23:14.268
Proclaiming peace will not only
preserve men, it will preserve face.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.187
I care not about preserving face.

23:16.270 --> 23:20.733
Preserving life, then.
My husband's life, my son's life.

23:20.817 --> 23:25.404
My war is with South China,
not with my wife and Empress.

23:25.488 --> 23:29.200
You know I heed your wisdom,
but there's no more waiting!

23:29.283 --> 23:33.830
This wall must break before me
or I die trying!

23:33.913 --> 23:35.707
There's nothing else!

24:27.759 --> 24:28.843
Hyah!

25:45.002 --> 25:46.128
Have you lit a fire?

25:46.212 --> 25:49.131
- I have.
- Light four more.

25:49.215 --> 25:52.594
Each of us ignites five fires,
every one man becomes many.

25:54.095 --> 25:56.555
An art of my great-grandfather's.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.183
War against the enemy's mind.

26:01.518 --> 26:05.607
I fear my father is desperate to believe
in your European war machines.

26:05.690 --> 26:07.024
As am I.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.527
- Will they work?
- They must.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.990
Is that how life works?

26:19.746 --> 26:22.206
Kaidu did not ride with the Khan.

26:24.667 --> 26:28.212
If we lose tomorrow,
he will become Khan.

26:28.295 --> 26:29.338
Of what?

26:29.421 --> 26:33.635
There will be nothing left to rule
when Chinese loyalty returns to Jia Sidao.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.681
In truth, I fear what may happen
should we win.

27:04.373 --> 27:06.668
Please, sit.

27:39.533 --> 27:44.706
What you did... defending me
in front of your father and brother...

27:46.248 --> 27:48.084
I can never repay you.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.836
I simply spoke the truth.

27:49.919 --> 27:53.547
The man you must truly repay
can never collect his debt.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.302
I must light my fires.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.142
Set my trebuchets.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.562
And test the Song wall.

29:07.789 --> 29:11.375
Catapults. Tried and failed.

29:12.001 --> 29:14.128
No, it's something else.

29:14.211 --> 29:16.923
- Are the men prepared?
- They are.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.551
Then let the war begin.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.562
Do you wish to give the order, Sire?

30:38.880 --> 30:40.256
Fire!

30:59.984 --> 31:01.443
More counterweight, Talib.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.695
- Any more weight, the axle will...
- More counterweight!

31:20.963 --> 31:21.964
Enough!

32:07.801 --> 32:10.096
- Again!
- Again!

32:37.206 --> 32:39.625
Take him to the tunnels.
Wait for me there.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.507
Teacher, I'm scared.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.595
Do not fear the wolves of the steppe.

32:51.678 --> 32:55.474
They are but wind
howling in the night, rattling doors.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.809
An emperor does not fear the thunder.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.603
All you need is this.

33:00.937 --> 33:03.690
I will come for you very soon.

33:38.517 --> 33:39.810
Speak, boy.

33:39.893 --> 33:43.647
It is going to be a long night.
A long day will follow.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.317
But it will be well worth it in the end.

33:48.652 --> 33:50.529
It doesn't feel as it should.

33:51.447 --> 33:52.614
Sire?

33:52.698 --> 33:55.034
I should feel more joy.

33:55.117 --> 33:59.496
When you are triumphant,
happiness will come.

34:00.289 --> 34:01.873
You're certain?

34:01.957 --> 34:03.250
I am.

34:04.793 --> 34:08.297
You will take the wall
and open the gate to all China.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.217
The dreams of your fathers
will be realized.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.929
As will your own.

34:17.681 --> 34:20.266
I must return to the line.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.206
Right, ready?

34:45.376 --> 34:46.418
Left, ready?

34:57.429 --> 34:58.430
Fire.

35:27.126 --> 35:30.045
They've broken through, Chancellor.

35:34.175 --> 35:38.429
All walls are built by men's hands
and they crumble by them as well.

35:40.431 --> 35:44.351
I will commend the Khan
just prior to taking his head.

35:45.894 --> 35:48.730
- Where is the breach?
- East of the gate tower.

35:51.733 --> 35:55.946
They will charge in their
Mongol formations by units of 10.

35:56.029 --> 35:59.533
Six of every 10 will be light archers.

35:59.616 --> 36:02.203
The remaining four
will be heavy lancers.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.206
Are the fire lancers ready?

36:05.289 --> 36:08.167
At your word, I give the command.

36:13.964 --> 36:16.258
All horses to the breach.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.373
Hyah!

38:13.041 --> 38:14.167
Now.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.212
Black powder!
Sidao has black powder!

39:42.213 --> 39:45.050
They've blocked the breach
with spears of fire.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.718
They're slaughtering our men!

39:46.802 --> 39:47.969
Push through.

39:49.513 --> 39:52.599
Prince Jingim has fallen, Great Khan.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.459
Surround the Prince!

43:13.299 --> 43:15.802
A round-eye?

43:17.428 --> 43:21.057
What stake do you have in this fight?

43:25.687 --> 43:28.982
Come down and surrender to your Khan.

43:33.319 --> 43:35.405
Surrender the Song dynasty...

43:37.032 --> 43:38.408
to a Mongol...

43:41.828 --> 43:45.707
by order of a European.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.681
Hmm.

44:19.407 --> 44:22.703
You white devils...
on the Silk Road...

44:23.662 --> 44:27.040
grovel for the Khan's favor.

44:27.123 --> 44:28.709
You have much to learn.

44:28.792 --> 44:30.877
Chancellor.

44:30.961 --> 44:35.131
Even a blind man can see that it is over.

46:28.203 --> 46:32.290
May Song dynasty
endure 10,000 more years.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.765
Where's the boy?

47:33.894 --> 47:35.603
Find him.

49:13.243 --> 49:17.872
Auspicious that I didn't defeat you
with my sword back in Cambulac.

49:17.955 --> 49:19.540
Prince.

49:23.419 --> 49:26.381
Our Khan will want to
hear your account, Polo.

49:27.840 --> 49:32.053
Then he will hear that his son fought
like his great-grandfather, Genghis.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.555
A Khan worthy of the throne.

49:46.442 --> 49:48.319
Peace to you...

49:48.403 --> 49:49.779
brother.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.461
Kokachin.

53:28.373 --> 53:30.040
Do you like it?

53:33.753 --> 53:37.340
Liu Guandao,
esteemed Song dynasty painter.

53:38.841 --> 53:42.303
If you do not like it,
you do not have to say so.

53:44.179 --> 53:46.474
I find it...

53:49.352 --> 53:51.228
exquisite.
