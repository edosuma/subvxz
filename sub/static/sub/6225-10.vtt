WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.881
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:04.964 --> 00:10.094
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.972
His name, Merlin.

00:15.308 --> 00:17.268
(TRUMPETS BLOWING)

00:20.104 --> 00:23.858
Father, we're not going into battle.
You don't have to look so somber.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.819
Never before
have the rulers of the five kingdoms

00:26.903 --> 00:28.237
come together in this way.

00:28.321 --> 00:31.991
Never before have we all worked towards
the same aim, towards peace.

00:34.452 --> 00:35.912
If these talks are successful,

00:35.995 --> 00:38.247
Camelot will enter a new era
of prosperity.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.211
If they fail,
it will almost certainly mean war.

00:51.344 --> 00:56.974
Boy, is it too much to ask
that you might anticipate my needs?

00:57.058 --> 00:59.644
-Sorry, Master. I was...
-Stop whinging.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.145
Sorry, Master.

01:01.896 --> 01:06.692
Alined, you are most welcome
on this momentous occasion.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.821
Momentous? Let us hope so.

01:16.619 --> 01:19.914
Uther may think that we are
gathered here for peace,

01:19.997 --> 01:22.750
but that is far from my mind.

01:24.001 --> 01:27.672
Am I to take it
that Lady Vivian is part of our plan?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.590
She is very lovely.

01:29.674 --> 01:34.011
Don't let her father hear you say that.
Not if you value your head.

01:34.095 --> 01:37.348
Indeed I do,
it is my prettiest feature.

01:40.059 --> 01:43.312
Olaf is the most over-protective buffoon
I've ever met.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.523
It would surely
end the peace talks

01:45.606 --> 01:48.109
if anyone were
to lay a finger on her.

01:48.192 --> 01:52.571
TRICKLER: But nobody in their
right mind would do that.

01:52.697 --> 01:58.703
But Arthur won't be
in his right mind, will he?

02:02.248 --> 02:03.666
(LAUGHING)

02:39.076 --> 02:40.911
What kind of welcome is this?

02:40.995 --> 02:43.873
You have us hanging around
like the last swallows of summer.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.083
You are welcome indeed, Olaf.

02:47.585 --> 02:48.753
(LAUGHING)

02:50.171 --> 02:53.049
May I present my daughter,
the Lady Vivian.

02:53.132 --> 02:57.428
Lady Vivian.
How like your mother you are.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.139
ARTHUR: I hope everything
is to your satisfaction?

03:00.264 --> 03:02.933
It is adequate.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.520
Most of our guests are
extremely happy here.

03:06.604 --> 03:10.566
-I am sure you will be, too.
-I am not most of your guests.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.943
Indeed.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.782
May I present Guinevere.

03:17.865 --> 03:20.910
She'll be looking after you
for the duration of your stay.

03:20.993 --> 03:24.538
You will want for nothing.
She is truly one of Camelot's finest.

03:24.622 --> 03:27.249
(LAUGHS)
Then I fear for Camelot.

03:34.465 --> 03:36.175
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:37.051 --> 03:39.011
-Good luck with that one.
-Mmm.

03:44.850 --> 03:47.520
| need to
prepare for the feast.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.360
Merlin?

03:56.404 --> 03:59.740
What kind of impression
do you think this gives?

04:00.449 --> 04:03.369
-That we have moths.
-Fetch me another.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.581
And who might you be
trying to impress, Sire?

04:07.665 --> 04:12.670
Let me see, perhaps the five kings
sitting in the banquet hall below.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.004
Oh!

04:14.922 --> 04:17.007
Not the King's daughter then?

04:17.091 --> 04:18.926
The Lady Vivian,
she is very beautiful.

04:19.009 --> 04:23.097
Anyone trying to impress the Lady Vivian
does so at extreme peril.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.516
Olaf would have their
head in a vat of hot oill

04:25.599 --> 04:28.018
before they'd had a chance
to say hello.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.688
Besides, she's not my type.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.441
She may be beautiful,
but she's incredibly rude.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.484
You should have heard
what she said to Gwen.

04:35.734 --> 04:39.029
And anyone insulting Gwen
should do so at extreme peril.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.824
-What?
-Nothing.

04:42.575 --> 04:45.619
| just know how you feel
about her, that's all.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.080
That is if your feelings
haven't changed,

04:48.164 --> 04:49.248
as I presume they haven't.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.208
| do have my own vat
of hot oil, you know?

04:51.292 --> 04:52.460
(LAUGHS)

04:52.543 --> 04:55.421
-You're blushing.
-No, I'm not.

04:55.504 --> 04:57.590
-What's wrong with Gwen?
-Nothing.

04:57.673 --> 04:59.550
| think she's very worthy
of your love.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.344
Indeed. Were it so.

05:02.887 --> 05:07.099
-Which it is.
-Merlin?

05:07.183 --> 05:09.435
-Yes, Arthur.
-Get out.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.729
Yes, Sire.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.775
(DOOR CLOSING)

05:49.391 --> 05:53.354
But it is not enough to just please
the gentlemen of the court.

05:53.437 --> 05:57.441
Now, I have a spectacle
for the ladies.

06:05.616 --> 06:08.244
-It is skill indeed.
-We aim to please.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.370
(GASPS)

06:10.538 --> 06:13.290
But what is this?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.584
Lady Vivian.

06:22.466 --> 06:26.053
It has mistaken you
for a beautiful flower.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.067
(TRICKLER CHANTING)

06:59.920 --> 07:03.215
Sleep well, Prince Arthur,
and when you wake,

07:03.299 --> 07:07.011
may your thoughts
be only of Vivian.

07:13.392 --> 07:14.685
Oh!

07:17.021 --> 07:18.314
(CHANTS)

07:23.485 --> 07:26.405
Sweet dreams.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.414
MERLIN: Good morning, Sire.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.125
Never have you been
more right, Merlin.

07:38.208 --> 07:41.045
It is the sunniest,
the most fragrant,

07:41.128 --> 07:44.632
the most beautiful morning
| have ever seen in my life.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.426
-You're dressed.
-I am the future King of Camelot,

07:47.509 --> 07:50.596
-I do have some skills, you know?
-Indeed, you are very skilled

07:50.679 --> 07:52.306
at getting people
to do things for you.

07:52.389 --> 07:58.646
It is your job.
But today my job is to woo.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.315
-To what?
-To woo.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.860
| wish to make
a proclamation of love.

08:05.944 --> 08:09.698
Really? I thought you wanted
to keep your feelings secret.

08:09.782 --> 08:12.117
Why would I want to do that?

08:12.201 --> 08:15.663
By the end of today,
| will have won my Lady.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.666
Right.

08:18.749 --> 08:21.877
-What will you tell your father?
-What does my father matter?

08:21.960 --> 08:23.796
That's one way of
approaching things.

08:24.505 --> 08:29.510
So, I need your help
in expressing my feelings.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.011
Of course.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.268
-How do I express my feelings?
-Oh! I see.

08:39.102 --> 08:42.481
-Feelings, girls.
-Feelings, girls.

08:42.563 --> 08:46.527
-Flowers.
-Excellent. Find some.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.238
-Perhaps you should also send a note.
-Brilliant idea.

08:49.321 --> 08:54.785
Something moving.
Something from the heart.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.162
Something...

08:58.247 --> 09:00.541
You'll think of something.

09:08.549 --> 09:09.633
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

Gwen? Gwen?

Your demands are
noted and will be

09:44.918 --> 09:47.337
taken into consideration
in due course.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.466
In the meantime, is there anyone else
who has any other comments

09:50.549 --> 09:53.093
about the Northern territories?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.888
-Did you do it?
- I left them in her room.

09:55.971 --> 09:57.598
| hope that was better
than a public display.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.308
You sure she got them?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.685
-I'm sure she will get them.
-Good.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.146
All we can do now is wait.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.942
But heaven has blessed me.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.487
She's even more beautiful than before.
Don't you agree?

10:11.570 --> 10:12.613
Yeah.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.073
I'm surprised to hear
you talk so openly.

10:15.157 --> 10:18.452
Nonsense.
| want to tell the world.

10:18.535 --> 10:22.039
| want to shout it across
the Kingdom.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.333
(INDISTINCT)

10:24.416 --> 10:25.959
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

10:26.043 --> 10:29.463
| understand your feelings,
but other people may object.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.716
Object? To what?

10:32.800 --> 10:35.636
You're the future King of Camelot,
and she's just a serving girl.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.679
Albeit a very
nice serving girl.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.056
(GROANS)

10:39.139 --> 10:42.184
Lady Vivian is of royal blood,
a future queen.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.771
I'll have your head if I hear
such insolence again.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.025
Lady Vivian?

10:51.527 --> 10:53.237
Oh, no.

10:57.199 --> 11:00.118
-Merlin. Can't you knock?
-Rats.

11:00.202 --> 11:02.412
What?

11:02.496 --> 11:07.376
Big, hairy, sharp teeth.
Yeah, definitely, under here.

11:07.793 --> 11:08.836
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

11:10.295 --> 11:14.007
-Are you feeling all right?
-Me. Never better.

11:15.467 --> 11:19.304
-You?
-I am having a very surprising day.

11:19.888 --> 11:22.140
-Really?
-You know one of those occasions

11:22.224 --> 11:24.518
when you've lost all hope
and then out of the blue

11:24.601 --> 11:26.728
something happens
to restore your faith?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.605
Sort of.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.400
Well, that's what's
happened to me today.

11:32.901 --> 11:37.489
| may have caused a problem.
Although it wasn't entirely my doing.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.075
-What now, Merlin?
-Arthur's in love.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.161
-And how did you cause that?
-That bit isn't my fault.

11:43.245 --> 11:45.747
The other bit is.
| can't tell you about that bit.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.375
-Clear as mud.
-Arthur's completely besotted.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.002
He can't
concentrate on anything.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.671
All he thinks about,
all he talks about is...

11:56.300 --> 11:59.845
-Is the Lady Vivian.
-The Lady Vivian?

11:59.928 --> 12:02.097
How could that have happened
SO suddenly?

12:02.180 --> 12:06.101
| don't know.
Something doesn't feel right.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.270
Only yesterday
he dismissed her as rude.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.938
If Arthur professes
his love for Vivian,

12:10.022 --> 12:11.523
Olaf will be furious.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.858
Surely Arthur knows that?

12:14.526 --> 12:19.239
He said it was his job to woo
his lady by the end of the day.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.991
Then it's your
job to stop him.

12:27.956 --> 12:31.209
-Who is it?
-It is destiny, my love.

12:34.004 --> 12:39.968
Destiny and chicken.
What a beautiful combination, eh?

12:44.598 --> 12:47.643
The beans are a little cold,
but the meat is very good.

12:47.726 --> 12:50.437
-Go away.
-My love, I do not know

12:50.520 --> 12:54.024
-what I have done to offended you.
-Your love? Not now, nor ever.

12:54.483 --> 12:55.442
Come now.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.861
My father will kill you
if he finds you here.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.530
-Your father does not worry me.
-You won't be saying that

13:00.614 --> 13:02.282
when he's running at you with
a knife in his hand.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.909
I've seen it before.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.036
-Really?
-Yes.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.499
-Just five minutes?
-My Lord,

13:10.832 --> 13:13.085
| don't think
your advances are welcome.

13:13.168 --> 13:16.672
VIVIAN: Go away,
and take your chicken with you.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.758
| don't know what gives you
that impression.

13:29.559 --> 13:35.357
Damn it! Every woman in the land
is attracted to this boy.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.319
I'm almost
attracted to him myself.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.737
(LAUGHS)

13:43.782 --> 13:45.325
Not Lady Vivian, my Lord.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.035
We have until
the end of tomorrow

13:47.119 --> 13:48.954
to scupper these talks.

13:49.037 --> 13:55.168
-I need war, do you understand?
-Yes, I do. I do.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.754
Peace will make me poor.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.466
And you know what happens
to poor kings.

14:02.384 --> 14:07.931
They cannot afford castles,
or knights,

14:09.391 --> 14:12.853
-or jesters.
-But, Master...

14:12.936 --> 14:15.897
Enough.
There will be time for sniveling

14:15.981 --> 14:21.445
when the axe is over your head.
Now, there is work to be done.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.031
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.705
-Go on, Merlin, say it.
-What?

14:33.331 --> 14:35.876
You do not think
| should pursue my love.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.044
Well, seeing as you asked,

14:37.127 --> 14:38.295
| think a number of things
stand in the way

14:38.378 --> 14:40.380
of a happy union
between you and the Lady Vivian.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.174
Her blood-thirsty father,
for one.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.342
Her complete
lack of interest for another.

14:46.636 --> 14:50.223
Might it be worthwhile
returning to your old love?

14:50.307 --> 14:52.684
| have my reservations
about that, as well.

14:52.768 --> 14:56.605
What are you talking about, Merlin?
| don't have an old love.

15:00.776 --> 15:04.196
What on Earth?

15:06.573 --> 15:07.824
You really need to

15:07.908 --> 15:09.951
start paying attention
to the details.

15:11.661 --> 15:13.955
| knew something wasn't right.

15:14.039 --> 15:17.084
-Arthur's enchanted.
- Ishould've realized he had magic.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.503
No one can make butterflies
appear from thin air.

15:19.961 --> 15:20.962
Trickier.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.839
Why would he want Arthur
to fall in love with Vivian?

15:23.173 --> 15:25.425
An advance by Arthur
would be a sure fire way

15:25.509 --> 15:27.594
to ruin the peace conference.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.806
-Maybe Alined wants war.
-Without creating it himself.

15:30.889 --> 15:34.184
It's the sort of cowardly behavior
you would expect from him.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.728
Cowardly, but clever.

15:36.812 --> 15:40.524
We need to find a way
of turning Arthur back to normal.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.858
Before it's too late.

15:52.869 --> 15:57.624
Lady Vivian... My love...

16:21.731 --> 16:22.983
GAIUS: Breakfast.

16:25.902 --> 16:30.240
There are over 636 love spells
in these books

16:30.323 --> 16:34.494
and over 150 of them
involve a lock of hair.

16:36.872 --> 16:39.416
Is there no way we can
narrow them down a bit?

16:39.541 --> 16:45.338
| have,
but if I choose this one and it's wrong,

16:45.422 --> 16:47.591
Arthur will end up as a toad.

16:47.716 --> 16:51.261
And if this one's wrong,
Vivian will lose all her hair.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.180
Olaf might not
declare war for that,

16:53.263 --> 16:55.098
but she certainly would!

16:58.602 --> 16:59.936
(CHANTS)

17:01.605 --> 17:02.939
(SHRIEKS)

17:04.107 --> 17:05.275
Whoops!

17:08.778 --> 17:10.446
Gwen has been detained.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.116
| thought you might
appreciate breakfast.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.536
Thank you, how kind.
| am so happy this morning,

17:16.619 --> 17:19.039
| could almost forget to eat.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.876
But that looks wonderful.
Really wonderful.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.546
Pray, my Lady,
what has caused such happiness?

17:26.630 --> 17:28.715
| cannot tell, so do not ask.

17:28.798 --> 17:34.930
Intriguing. You know,
another meaning of jester is

17:35.096 --> 17:38.558
-keeper of secrets.
-Really?

17:38.642 --> 17:42.145
-No.
-Trickier, you mustn't tell.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.314
Not a soul.
Especially not my father.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.150
-Go on.
-I am in love.

17:47.234 --> 17:48.318
(GASPS)

17:48.401 --> 17:51.154
How wonderful. With me?

17:51.279 --> 17:52.322
(LAUGHS)

17:53.156 --> 17:55.909
With a man more courageous
than a lion,

17:55.992 --> 17:58.411
stronger than an ox,
and so perfectly formed

17:58.495 --> 18:01.665
it is as if he had been
sculpted by the gods themselves.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.416
But it must be me?

18:03.500 --> 18:06.836
Just to speak his name
brings me pleasure indeed.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.674
-Then speak it you should.
-Arthur.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.177
There, I have said it.
My heart belongs to Arthur.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.305
Excellent.

18:17.681 --> 18:21.685
-In fact, I am going to tell him now.
-Oh! A brilliant idea.

18:21.768 --> 18:27.357
-Where is Gwen? I must dress.
-But you look so beautiful, my Lady.

18:27.482 --> 18:32.195
-How could he refuse you like this?
-In my night gown?

18:32.279 --> 18:34.531
Why not?

18:34.864 --> 18:36.032
Hmm.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.879
What is it, Arthur?

18:49.963 --> 18:53.008
You look like
you have something on your mind.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.511
You read me like a book.

18:58.221 --> 19:03.393
| have made a fool of myself,
that's all. That's everything.

19:03.727 --> 19:06.229
I'm sure that is not true.

19:06.563 --> 19:10.150
You have a good heart,
Guinevere, but I'm afraid it is.

19:10.233 --> 19:16.031
| have made a gesture.
And it was not well received.

19:16.406 --> 19:18.992
-You're sure?
-Pretty sure.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.244
Then you are wrong.

19:23.038 --> 19:25.707
You are very close
to the lady in question.

19:27.417 --> 19:31.755
Your token was much appreciated,
but the situation is delicate.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.843
And it is not always easy to express
what is really in one's heart.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.095
You think there's hope?

19:39.512 --> 19:41.598
There is always hope.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.394
If only I had
some way of knowing.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.773
Indeed, my Lord.

19:59.532 --> 20:03.870
| wish to see Arthur.
Your master. My Lord.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.748
-Your what?
-My heart's delight.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.209
-Oh, no.
-Where is he?

20:09.292 --> 20:11.961
He's not here.
Which is a very good thing, I believe.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.881
-Then I shall wait.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

20:14.964 --> 20:18.134
-You're not even dressed.
-My love does not care what I wear,

20:18.259 --> 20:21.638
-only that I am near. Now fetch him.
-I cannot.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.139
-You will.
-I shan't.

20:23.264 --> 20:27.644
-As he commands you, I command you.
-I am asking you to leave.

20:27.727 --> 20:32.732
| want my love,
| need my love. I want to see him now.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.158
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)

20:45.620 --> 20:49.749
And so moving on
to our final point for discussion,

20:49.833 --> 20:52.085
the boundaries of the
Eastern territories.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.922
This is a point
that I am willing to concede.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.174
-That is very generous.
-Excuse me, Sire?

20:58.258 --> 21:00.510
-One moment.
-(WHISPERING)

21:02.137 --> 21:04.305
What?

21:06.516 --> 21:09.144
-Where is she?
-What's that?

21:13.356 --> 21:15.692
Oh, no. Oh, no.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.780
Okay, you need to go.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.950
You cannot keep us apart.
It is written in the stars.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.619
Vivian and Arthur,
a love for all time.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.122
A love stronger
than time, a love...

21:29.205 --> 21:30.206
(CHANTING)

21:38.173 --> 21:40.133
Why are you hanging around
like a bad smell?

21:40.216 --> 21:44.053
It's me who needs to bathe.
I'm not going to win my love

21:44.179 --> 21:46.890
-stinking like an old kipper.
-No, my Lord.

21:46.973 --> 21:50.685
Where is she?
| know she's in here, Arthur.

21:51.561 --> 21:54.481
Hand her over,
or feel my wrath.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.817
-What's he talking about?
-She wasn't even dressed.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.986
If I have
dishonored you in some way

22:00.069 --> 22:02.739
then by all means
provide me with proof and

22:02.864 --> 22:05.492
-I'll face the consequences.
-Trickier here has told me

22:05.575 --> 22:08.578
that the Lady Vivian
is in your chambers.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.747
If only that were true.

22:10.872 --> 22:14.584
If only that were true,
you would not look so foolish.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.759
Search the room.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.595
You'd better hope
| don't find her.

22:28.431 --> 22:29.724
(CHANTING)

22:34.771 --> 22:35.772
Mmm.

22:37.774 --> 22:39.275
(HUMMING)

22:49.452 --> 22:51.663
That hasn't opened in years.

22:55.792 --> 23:00.088
Buffoon!
You've made an idiot out of me.

23:02.924 --> 23:08.805
| am so terribly sorry, Arthur,
to have disturbed you.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.433
| do hope that
you will forgive me.

23:18.398 --> 23:22.986
Check on the Lady Vivian,
and remain outside her room.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.823
If only the Lady Vivian
were in my room.

23:27.073 --> 23:32.662
How delightful that would be,
eh, Merlin?

23:37.125 --> 23:39.335
Merlin?

23:41.546 --> 23:43.756
Merlin?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.260
(EXHALES)

23:52.974 --> 23:55.852
It's that meddlesome Merlin.
He's on to us, my Lord.

23:57.270 --> 24:01.608
There was nothing I could do.
You do understand, Master?

24:02.525 --> 24:04.944
So you forgive your boy?

24:05.028 --> 24:09.866
You have a matter of hours
before the peace treaty is signed.

24:09.991 --> 24:13.286
That is time enough, Master.
Time enough.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.955
It's less time
than you've had already,

24:16.039 --> 24:19.375
and you haven't
managed it so far.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.712
But the enchantment is strong,
my Lord.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.007
Sooner or later the two
will be drawn together.

24:27.467 --> 24:30.803
For the sake of
your prettiest feature,

24:30.887 --> 24:34.641
you had better believe
that to be the case.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.142
(GRUNTING)

24:48.196 --> 24:49.572
(ALL LAUGHING)

24:51.074 --> 24:54.160
This is indeed a momentous day
for the five kingdoms.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.829
This peace treaty
has been long in the making.

24:56.913 --> 24:59.332
| know you must all be keen
to return to your families,

24:59.415 --> 25:02.752
so we will make preparations for the
signing ceremony immediately.

25:02.835 --> 25:09.092
-I am pleased, friends. Very pleased.
-As are we all.

25:09.217 --> 25:10.593
(LAUGHS)

25:13.096 --> 25:15.598
-That's it. I've got it!
-Are you sure?

25:15.682 --> 25:17.934
You're not going to turn Arthur
into a hunchback camel,

25:18.017 --> 25:21.104
-or a horny-eyed toad?
-I'll save that for another day.

25:29.779 --> 25:32.615
"A second chance.

25:32.699 --> 25:37.537
"Sunset.
| will await your presence."

(INAUDIBLE)

(SNORING)

26:52.195 --> 26:55.031
Arthur? Arthur?

27:16.385 --> 27:18.554
(SOFTLY) We can't find Arthur.

27:19.388 --> 27:22.391
-Is there a problem, Uther?
-No, not at all.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.977
Arthur is just
running a little late, that's all.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.395
Ah!

27:26.646 --> 27:29.023
As is the Lady Vivian.

27:37.865 --> 27:42.245
-My love.
-Always. Forever.

(CHANTING)

(REPEATING CHANT)

28:04.767 --> 28:07.687
-I knew it!
-I don't believe it.

28:07.770 --> 28:10.106
Father, we've got something
to tell you.

28:10.189 --> 28:13.276
-Arthur!
-Father?

28:13.359 --> 28:16.362
You once said that if you
ever truly offended my honor,

28:16.445 --> 28:18.531
then you would
happily pay the price.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.868
-What say you now, Prince Arthur?
-How have I offended your honor?

28:21.951 --> 28:24.620
-Surely not with my love alone.
-Love?

28:24.745 --> 28:26.873
You don't know the first thing
about love.

28:26.956 --> 28:29.375
You are taking advantage
of an innocent girl.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.043
-Father...
-Arthur!

28:31.127 --> 28:33.713
| assure you
my feelings for your daughter

28:33.796 --> 28:35.214
are as real as they are strong.

28:35.298 --> 28:37.717
Unhand her,
or suffer the consequences.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.052
Is this really worth
risking your life for?

28:40.136 --> 28:42.305
-Arthur?
-Indeed it is.

28:42.430 --> 28:45.892
| would rather die,
than deny my feelings.

28:45.975 --> 28:50.104
| love your daughter
with all my heart.

29:23.804 --> 29:25.097
(BELL TOLLING)

29:25.181 --> 29:26.682
It's no good.
I've spoken to Olaf.

29:26.766 --> 29:30.937
He will not rescind the challenge.
He says his honor has been tainted.

29:31.020 --> 29:34.357
-He demands recompense.
-You didn't have to do that, Father.

29:34.482 --> 29:38.277
The fight is to the death.
What did you think you were doing?

29:38.361 --> 29:40.780
You cannot help
who you fall in love with.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.740
You do you realize
that your actions

29:42.823 --> 29:44.283
threaten the peace talks,

29:44.367 --> 29:47.119
and that it may yet
bring war to Camelot?

29:47.203 --> 29:50.206
| am happy to fight
for what I believe in.

29:50.331 --> 29:54.710
-What's happened to him?
-Lady Vivian. Nothing more.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.339
And yet,
who could wish for more?

30:08.849 --> 30:11.978
| don't understand it.
Trickler's magic's strong,

30:12.061 --> 30:14.063
but surely it can't be
stronger than mine?

30:14.146 --> 30:17.316
These love potions
are strange things.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.819
-You need to go to Uther.
-No!

30:19.902 --> 30:22.405
-It's a fight to the death!
-If Uther realizes

30:22.488 --> 30:26.742
that one of the kings is using magic,
there will certainly be a war.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.536
The only way out
of this situation

30:28.619 --> 30:30.997
is to un-enchant Arthur.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.001
And un-enchant him fast!

30:41.298 --> 30:44.093
-Anything interesting?
-Haven't you heard?

30:45.136 --> 30:47.930
Arthur was discovered
in Lady Vivian's chambers.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.641
-What?
-King Olaf has demanded recompense.

30:50.725 --> 30:55.396
They are to fight to the death.
All for the love of a woman.

30:55.813 --> 31:00.651
And Lady Vivian, at that.
You look more shocked than I did.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.572
-It is very surprising.
- I don't know why

31:04.655 --> 31:07.324
-he couldn't control his feelings.
-Indeed.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.537
| will miss the tourney
if you don't mind.

31:11.620 --> 31:15.708
-There is so much to organize here.
-But of course.

31:17.501 --> 31:20.838
-Guinevere, you will wish me luck?
-Will I?

31:20.921 --> 31:25.217
-Haven't you heard?
-Oh yes, I've heard.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.846
Though sadly not
from your lips.

31:28.929 --> 31:32.641
| wish you could've been
more honest with me, Arthur.

31:32.725 --> 31:36.020
-What is she talking about?
-No idea.

31:38.606 --> 31:43.527
You are pleased, my Lord?
Do I get to keep my fingers?

31:44.820 --> 31:49.825
Trickier, I shall cast
your fingers in gold.

my Lord.

31:57.374 --> 32:01.045
If Olaf kills Arthur,
then Uther will start a war.

32:01.128 --> 32:04.840
If Arthur kills Olaf,
then his men will start a war.

We cannot lose! No!

32:13.641 --> 32:17.019
King Olaf has
demanded recompense

32:17.103 --> 32:20.773
and by the ancient laws of Camelot,
the matter will be settled

32:20.856 --> 32:24.235
by a tourney in three stages.

32:25.361 --> 32:29.532
The weapons chosen are
quarter staff, mace and sword.

32:30.366 --> 32:33.202
The fight will be by
the Knights rules and to the death.

32:39.083 --> 32:41.252

Love really can conquer all,

is in the clouds.

-I don't know what to do.
-Then find someone who does.

This is magic indeed.

34:32.446 --> 34:35.114

tried has failed.

From what you tell me,
the spell has captured his heart.

34:39.036 --> 34:41.205
And his heart is
controlling his brain.

34:41.288 --> 34:44.917
There is no magic
that can break this enchantment.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.920
-There must be.
-It has too great a hold.

34:48.003 --> 34:52.591
-I cannot let Arthur die!
-Patience, young warlock.

34:52.675 --> 34:59.223
The solution lies in a force
greater than you or I can understand.

34:59.306 --> 35:02.518
A force that has
puzzled many minds.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.437
-Please, I have very little time.
-A force...

35:05.521 --> 35:07.690
-Just tell me!
-(LAUGHING)

35:11.151 --> 35:14.905
Why, it is the greatest force of all.

35:16.407 --> 35:19.493
-Love.
-Love?

35:19.576 --> 35:22.913
You must find the person
Arthur truly loves.

35:23.831 --> 35:26.542
-And then what?
-One kiss from her,

35:26.625 --> 35:32.339
will break the enchantment
and he will desire Vivian no more.

35:34.591 --> 35:35.801
(EXHALES)

35:37.970 --> 35:40.139
GAIUS: Are you sure
you can carry on, Sire?

35:40.222 --> 35:44.184
As long as I have Vivian to gaze at,
| can conquer the world.

35:44.268 --> 35:48.522
Besides, the mace is my forte.
You'll see.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.649
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

36:11.253 --> 36:17.051
-Rats again, Merlin?
-What? No, no. I need your help.

36:17.134 --> 36:21.388
-Arthur needs your help.
- I do not think that Arthur needs me.

36:21.472 --> 36:25.017
Gwen, don't worry, I know.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.603
-You know what?
-Everything.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.104
Anyone who spends
five minutes you

36:29.188 --> 36:30.522
can see how you
feel about each other.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.566
Look, I do not have
a lot of time to explain.

36:32.649 --> 36:34.151
You're gonna
have to trust me.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.820
-Arthur does love you.
-No, he doesn't.

36:36.904 --> 36:39.907
If you don't trust me,
trust your feelings.

36:39.990 --> 36:41.533
I'm never trusting
my feelings again.

36:41.617 --> 36:44.328
-He's enchanted.
-Yes, with Lady Vivian,

36:44.411 --> 36:47.373
-I can see that.
-I mean literally enchanted

36:47.456 --> 36:51.543
with magic, potions, love juice.
None of his feelings are genuine.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.587
How can you be sure?

36:53.670 --> 36:56.256
When I saw him,
his feelings seemed real enough.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.176
Gwen, none of his feelings
for Vivian are real.

36:59.259 --> 37:02.304
But if you do not break the spell,
his death will be.

37:02.388 --> 37:05.099
Search your heart,
you know who he loves.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.165
(GROANS)

37:44.680 --> 37:46.306
(CROWD EXCLAIM)

37:56.817 --> 37:58.444
(GONG CLANGING)

37:58.902 --> 38:00.487
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

38:19.590 --> 38:21.967
Ahl Have you finally come
to wish me good luck?

38:22.050 --> 38:24.136
"Cause I really don't think
| need it anymore.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.889
No, Arthur, I have not
come to wish you luck.

38:27.973 --> 38:32.019
-Honestly, that is rather rude.
-Then let me make amends.

38:59.588 --> 39:01.298
(GRUNTING IN PAIN)

39:04.801 --> 39:08.096
-What am I doing?
-You're in a fight.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.975
To the death. You're losing.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.272
-But...
-There is no time to explain.

39:17.356 --> 39:20.692
Just live for me, Arthur.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.363
That's all I ask right now.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.159
(CROWD CHEERING)

39:38.961 --> 39:42.673
Merlin, if anything should happen to me,
look after Gwen.

39:42.798 --> 39:46.301
The world may think
she is just a servant, dispensable.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.972
But she's not
dispensable to me.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.685
(GROANING)

40:57.539 --> 41:00.208
This is no way
to achieve peace.

41:37.287 --> 41:40.749
| thought I better deliver it
myself this time.

41:42.918 --> 41:47.464
I'm sorry.
For what I put you through.

41:47.798 --> 41:51.301
No.
You have nothing to apologize for.

41:52.803 --> 41:55.597
| too have caused
my fair share of hurt.

41:57.599 --> 42:00.268
You must believe
that my feelings for

42:02.562 --> 42:05.732
Vivian were not real.

42:09.111 --> 42:10.612
| have never loved another.

42:12.781 --> 42:15.617
But one day you will.

42:15.742 --> 42:19.830
One day you will find
your real princess.

42:19.955 --> 42:22.582
One day you will
be King of Camelot.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.752
And I cannot be your queen.

42:29.464 --> 42:33.260
-You don't know that.
-I am as sure of that as you are.

42:36.263 --> 42:39.766
-Things may change.
-Well, until they do...

42:42.060 --> 42:44.312
My Lord.

42:58.452 --> 43:01.663
Your boy has a very wise head
on his shoulders.

43:01.788 --> 43:05.083
No doubt he gets that from you.

43:05.167 --> 43:08.754
| hope these events
will not harm our peace treaty.

43:08.837 --> 43:12.507
| believe that Vivian
was as much to blame as Arthuir.

43:13.175 --> 43:15.927
I'll take her
away from temptation.

43:16.011 --> 43:19.264
She is far too young
to encounter such things.

43:19.347 --> 43:22.267
Yes, I go in peace.

43:23.185 --> 43:25.103
| am very
pleased to hear that.

43:25.187 --> 43:30.525
This is more than you deserve, boy.
You will run all the way home.

43:30.609 --> 43:33.862
-That's not possible, Master.
-Make it possible.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.114
Why so cross, Alined?

43:36.198 --> 43:38.283
Anyone would think
you didn't want peace?

43:38.366 --> 43:42.621
But of course I do.
Peace, love it.

43:43.163 --> 43:46.374
You may return any time
to view the treaty.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.627
You are very kind.

43:56.176 --> 43:57.385
We may return, too?

43:58.929 --> 44:02.474
-You are always welcome.
-My heart will remain,

44:02.557 --> 44:04.100
and I hope to join it soon.

44:09.439 --> 44:11.399
Not too soon.

44:11.483 --> 44:14.569
No, it might conflict
with your one true love.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.072
-My what?
-You heard me. I have proof.

44:17.155 --> 44:20.575
-Proof?
-You kissed her in the tent.

44:21.827 --> 44:24.579
-Merlin?
-Yes.

44:24.704 --> 44:27.249
-What happened in the tent...
-Mmm-hmm?

44:27.332 --> 44:32.087
-Speak of it again and I'll kill you.
-Okay.

44:34.256 --> 44:35.841
DRAGON: Merlin.

44:36.925 --> 44:38.385
The ancient prophecies

44:38.468 --> 44:42.931
speak of an alliance
of Mordred and Morgana

44:43.181 --> 44:45.809
united in evil.

44:45.892 --> 44:48.353
This crystal cannot fall
into enemy hands.

44:49.062 --> 44:51.147
Is it some kind of weapon?

44:51.231 --> 44:52.732
Mordred will
master the crystal

44:52.816 --> 44:55.902
and when he does,
we will strike Uther down.

44:55.986 --> 45:00.448
DRAGON: This union must be stopped,
whatever the cost.
