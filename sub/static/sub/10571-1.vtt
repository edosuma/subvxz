WEBVTT

00:20.132 --> 00:21.292
Stay back!

00:32.777 --> 00:34.676
He should've said "heel".

00:57.401 --> 00:58.765
Slag it!

01:01.972 --> 01:06.034
- He's got a delicate touch, Dee Dee.
- Delicate like a moose, Dee Dee.

01:09.212 --> 01:13.239
I hate ripping this heavy junk.
Give me cash cards any day.

01:14.552 --> 01:18.578
Zip it, Bonk.
Plan is get in and get out fast.

01:21.257 --> 01:24.715
It's a school night, boys and girls.
I'm gonna have to call your folks.

01:50.587 --> 01:52.316
Bonk! Don't!

01:52.790 --> 01:54.257
Yeah, Bonk.
Don't.

03:22.056 --> 03:24.150
Let's go! Dee Dee,
open the door.

03:24.359 --> 03:25.792
On the double.

03:55.657 --> 03:56.954
Incoming!

04:06.602 --> 04:08.536
Bonk! You moron!
Get back here!

04:52.648 --> 04:54.377
You got a death wish, Bats!

04:54.615 --> 04:57.209
And I thought I was just
being a good citizen.

05:02.290 --> 05:03.348
Got you, sis!

05:12.995 --> 05:14.427
Flagpole.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.956
What did you say?

05:16.165 --> 05:17.632
Flagpole.

05:32.348 --> 05:33.576
Come on!

06:02.446 --> 06:04.812
That ain't coming
out of my allowance.

08:25.918 --> 08:27.579
Still got it.

08:39.432 --> 08:41.297
How did it go with the Jokerz?

08:42.033 --> 08:44.764
I broke up the robbery,
but it was weird.

08:45.703 --> 08:49.303
Third time this month that particulary gang was
trying to gintercepted high-tech machinery.

08:49.341 --> 08:50.740
Jokerz don't use that stuff.

08:51.177 --> 08:54.634
They're probably fencing it.
Corporate espionage is big business.

08:55.179 --> 08:58.206
I may as well sit tight until
I can get another shot at them.

08:59.418 --> 09:00.644
Hey, lookie here.

09:00.951 --> 09:01.951
That's right, Tom.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.179
Today, Gotham billionaire Bruce Wayne
stunned the financial world...

09:05.389 --> 09:08.918
with his plan to resume active
leadership of Wayne Enterprises.

09:09.126 --> 09:12.028
While shareholders have generally
welcomed Wayne's return...

09:12.230 --> 09:15.995
support from some key members of the
Wayne board has been oddly lukewarm.

09:16.201 --> 09:19.727
Company operations manager,
Jordan Pryce, offered this comment:

09:19.938 --> 09:22.600
I, of course, join the rest of our
Wayne Enterprises family...

09:22.807 --> 09:27.143
in welcoming back our most valuable
senior resource, Bruce Wayne.

09:27.346 --> 09:30.610
I'm sure we'll all profit
from his years of experience.

09:30.817 --> 09:34.480
Still, the day to day rigors of running
a vast, multinational conglomerate...

09:34.687 --> 09:36.846
would be stressful,
even for a young man.

09:37.056 --> 09:39.250
I hope Mr. Wayne is up
to the challenge.

09:39.557 --> 09:41.254
He's not bitter, much.

09:41.659 --> 09:43.993
Pryce was next in line
for the top spot.

09:44.428 --> 09:47.422
My return torpedoed any dreams
he had of succession.

09:48.167 --> 09:51.192
- You gonna keep him around?
- If he'll stay on my terms.

09:51.403 --> 09:55.100
I've worked long and hard to regain
control of my family's company.

09:55.307 --> 09:56.865
And I won't hand it over again.

09:57.076 --> 10:01.010
Pryce can either get with that program
or start e-mailing his résumé.

10:01.346 --> 10:03.859
With all the long hours you'll planning
on putting in at the office...

10:03.883 --> 10:06.442
does this mean
you'll have less time for....

10:06.851 --> 10:08.341
Who sleeps anymore?

10:11.856 --> 10:12.856
You okay?

10:13.057 --> 10:15.152
You know the Jokerz are going
in for splicing now.

10:15.360 --> 10:19.625
Crazy hyena-boy nearly took a bite out of
me. No way I could explain that to Dana.

10:19.831 --> 10:21.129
You're not going out now?

10:21.332 --> 10:22.961
The night is young and so am I.

10:23.168 --> 10:25.831
I think a good night's rest
might be more beneficial.

10:26.138 --> 10:28.798
Like you said,
who sleeps anymore?

10:36.981 --> 10:38.711
Up and at them, Terry.

10:41.019 --> 10:44.283
You can doze on Bruce Wayne's time,
not mine.

10:44.523 --> 10:45.922
Sorry, Dane.

11:12.384 --> 11:14.046
Great song, huh?

11:15.452 --> 11:18.753
Did you see the squid Blade's with?
P.U.!

11:20.826 --> 11:22.918
Ter, my head's on fire.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.695
You look good.

11:25.230 --> 11:26.389
McGinnis!

11:31.604 --> 11:34.971
Sorry, babe. Guess the day
was longer than I thought.

11:37.710 --> 11:39.677
Let's sit this one out.

11:40.879 --> 11:43.211
Coffee.
And leave the pot.

11:47.885 --> 11:49.912
Batman showed up
and we had to ditch.

11:50.120 --> 11:54.081
We were able to save this:
the console's memory board.

11:55.394 --> 11:56.759
I know it's not much but...

11:57.296 --> 12:00.561
It's not much?
It's nothing.

12:03.201 --> 12:04.668
Losers.

12:05.471 --> 12:06.495
All of you.

12:06.706 --> 12:10.767
A disgrace to the name Joker.
Why, in my day...

12:10.975 --> 12:12.341
In your day?!

12:12.543 --> 12:14.774
Ever since you cone
your way into this gang...

12:14.980 --> 12:17.916
it's been "your day" this
and "your day" that.

12:18.115 --> 12:19.115
Bonk.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.014
Your day is over, old man.

12:21.220 --> 12:25.279
Even if you are who you say you are.
And personally, I think you're a fake.

12:25.490 --> 12:28.221
Ah, brave new world...

12:28.427 --> 12:30.691
that has such putzes in it.

12:31.096 --> 12:34.863
He's got us running around ripping
a lot of geek junk, but no cash!

12:35.432 --> 12:38.460
He won't tell us what his plan is,
if he even has one.

12:38.671 --> 12:40.605
I want out!

12:40.873 --> 12:42.465
If you insist.

12:46.144 --> 12:49.979
Hey, man. Take it easy.
I was just kidding.

12:53.152 --> 12:54.913
So was I.

13:04.864 --> 13:07.524
Oops. No,
I wasn't.

13:09.368 --> 13:12.201
That's also how we
did it in my day.

13:14.441 --> 13:18.466
You know, kids, a lot has changed
while your old Uncle Joker's been away.

13:18.677 --> 13:21.009
New Gotham, new rules...

13:21.215 --> 13:23.541
even a new Batman.

13:25.785 --> 13:28.184
But now I'm tanned,
I'm rested...

13:28.687 --> 13:32.552
and I'm ready to give
this old town a wedgie again!

13:33.225 --> 13:34.692
I have to know you're with me.

13:35.363 --> 13:38.759
- Will you say it for me one time?
- We're with you.

13:39.267 --> 13:41.792
- Little louder.
- We're with you!

13:42.003 --> 13:43.197
Dee Dee?

13:43.538 --> 13:45.836
- We're with you!
- Boys?

13:46.038 --> 13:48.941
- We're with you.
- Bonk?

13:50.208 --> 13:51.243
Oh, right.

13:51.652 --> 13:52.652
Dead.

13:53.312 --> 13:55.740
Dee Dee, be lam
and sweap out the trash.

13:56.217 --> 13:57.349
There's good girls.

14:01.726 --> 14:05.392
Your renewed faith puts
a smile in my heart.

14:05.662 --> 14:08.629
What's if we forget tonight
mishappened and start over...

14:09.427 --> 14:10.894
Great, boss.

14:11.163 --> 14:14.860
Ghoul, my boy, we're going
to need another systems scanner.

14:15.067 --> 14:17.591
Who's got one
they'd be willing to donate?

14:17.802 --> 14:18.996
Checking.

14:19.337 --> 14:21.635
What we're after
is cutting-edge.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.740
These are the only other places
we'd find one.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.543
Nope.

14:26.912 --> 14:28.004
No.

14:29.114 --> 14:32.105
What, there?
Security's gonna be tight!

14:32.717 --> 14:35.948
Oh, yes.
But think of the fun.

14:41.826 --> 14:43.192
Good evening,
Mr. Wayne.

14:43.461 --> 14:46.431
Ms. Carr. You remember
my assistant, Terry McGinnis?

14:46.631 --> 14:49.032
Of course. I'm glad
you could join us, Terry.

14:49.967 --> 14:54.268
Everyone is here. Well, everyone
except Mr. Pryce, unfortunately.

14:54.472 --> 14:56.030
That's no surprise.

14:57.208 --> 14:59.039
May I have your attention,
please?

14:59.244 --> 15:03.577
It's my pleasure to welcome back
the guiding light of this company:

15:04.515 --> 15:06.211
Bruce Wayne.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.682
Thank you, Joyce.

15:14.893 --> 15:19.023
It's a pleasure to see you all again.
In the future, I hope to...

15:26.404 --> 15:29.635
spend time getting to know
each member of our company...

15:29.841 --> 15:32.365
learning about you individually.

15:53.432 --> 15:54.432
Security!

15:54.466 --> 15:56.592
Emergency on terrace level.

16:01.373 --> 16:03.033
Hey!
Look out!

16:18.490 --> 16:20.957
- You gonna be okay?
- Go to work.

16:23.595 --> 16:25.653
Well,
if it isn't old Mr. Wayne.

16:26.498 --> 16:27.725
So debonair.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.024
So dapper.

16:31.736 --> 16:32.999
So decrepit.

16:46.717 --> 16:47.980
Hello, Gotham!

16:48.186 --> 16:50.177
Joker's back in town!

16:53.225 --> 16:54.692
It can't be.

16:54.893 --> 16:59.091
Oh, no, your old eyes
do not deceive you, Brucie!

16:59.297 --> 17:02.095
After all, who'd know me
better than you?

17:04.867 --> 17:06.028
Back off, gruesome.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.141
Ah, the new boy.

17:12.343 --> 17:14.538
Ears are too long
and I miss the cape...

17:14.743 --> 17:17.577
but not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.

17:17.781 --> 17:18.875
Woof!

17:30.728 --> 17:33.821
- How's it coming, boys?
- We're home free.

17:34.030 --> 17:35.520
Then I'll see you there.

17:40.372 --> 17:42.338
Time to go, Dee Dee.

18:19.276 --> 18:21.574
Well?
What's it gonna be, Batfake?

18:51.674 --> 18:54.576
I know what you're thinking.
I messed up.

18:54.778 --> 18:56.972
I let the clown go
to save those people.

18:57.347 --> 18:58.712
You did the right thing.

18:59.282 --> 19:04.049
So, the Joker, huh? Looks pretty spry
for a guy who's gotta be, what?

19:04.255 --> 19:05.518
Mid-eighties?

19:07.259 --> 19:09.020
Any theories on that?

19:09.292 --> 19:10.384
Clone?

19:10.760 --> 19:11.854
Robot?

19:12.061 --> 19:15.624
Suspended animation due to floating
around frozen in a block of ice?

19:15.834 --> 19:17.323
Shut up and drive.

19:19.068 --> 19:20.068
Yes, sir.

19:27.345 --> 19:31.748
This was the scene three hours ago, as a
man claiming to be the legendary Joker...

19:31.950 --> 19:35.851
disrupted a ceremony at the newly
opened Wayne Enterprises building.

19:36.053 --> 19:37.576
Honey, what're you watching?

19:37.788 --> 19:41.587
Adding to the drama was the appearance of
another legendary Gotham icon, the Batman...

19:41.791 --> 19:45.192
who engaged his one-time foe
in a stunning aerial battle.

19:45.563 --> 19:46.654
Honey?

19:46.865 --> 19:48.262
It's nothing, sweetheart.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.233
Nothing.

20:01.613 --> 20:02.613
Go away.

20:02.946 --> 20:03.946
Morning, commish.

20:04.147 --> 20:06.809
You understand English, McGinnis?
Scram.

20:07.018 --> 20:10.213
Love to. But first, what can you
tell me about clowns?

20:10.587 --> 20:12.782
In this town
they're never funny.

20:12.990 --> 20:14.513
I noticed that.

20:17.361 --> 20:19.557
- Now, this Joker...
- Drop it, kid.

20:19.762 --> 20:22.731
- That's what the old man's been saying.
- Listen to him.

20:22.932 --> 20:26.993
Hey look, I know this fruitcake was a big,
bad guy from the cape and cowl days.

20:27.203 --> 20:28.568
He was more than that.

20:28.771 --> 20:30.967
What? A wacko
who threatened people...

20:31.174 --> 20:33.576
with whoopee cushions
and squirting flowers?

20:33.876 --> 20:35.903
- Big deal. I'm shaking.
- McGinnis!

20:40.451 --> 20:43.578
The Joker, the real Joker, was unlike
anyone you've ever faced.

20:43.788 --> 20:45.721
For your sake,
I hope you never do.

20:45.923 --> 20:48.288
If Bruce wants you to drop it,
then drop it.

20:49.961 --> 20:53.259
- Commissioner, your 9 o'clock is here.
- Send him in.

20:53.565 --> 20:54.565
You were leaving?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.490
Figure I was.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.880
- Thanks for seeing me, Barb.
- That's what I'm here for.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.500
JOKER
DECEASED

21:29.040 --> 21:30.040
VOICE ID

21:32.236 --> 21:35.000
a countdown of victims
that will end at midnight...

21:35.204 --> 21:38.935
unless our dear Dark Knight
stops me first!

21:42.614 --> 21:45.646
Hello, Gotham.
Joker's back in town!

21:48.181 --> 21:49.340
VOICE MATCH
IDENTICAL

21:54.459 --> 21:55.653
It's funny.

21:55.894 --> 21:59.453
I know about all of your other major
enemies but you never mention him.

21:59.798 --> 22:03.926
- He was the biggest, wasn't he?
- It wasn't a popularity contest.

22:04.134 --> 22:06.797
He was a psychopath.
A monster.

22:07.371 --> 22:10.364
So how is it possible he could still
be around after all this time?

22:10.840 --> 22:12.365
It's not possible.

22:12.576 --> 22:14.544
He died years ago.

22:14.744 --> 22:15.744
You're sure?

22:16.012 --> 22:17.445
I was there.

22:21.586 --> 22:23.246
You killed him, didn't you?

22:25.490 --> 22:28.459
He was gonna do something so terrible,
you had no other choice.

22:28.659 --> 22:31.058
- Terry...
- That was it, wasn't it?

22:35.098 --> 22:37.567
I want you to give back
the Batman suit.

22:37.902 --> 22:40.061
What? Why?

22:40.269 --> 22:42.897
There is no reason for you
to continue.

22:43.106 --> 22:45.576
You've made your father's killers
pay for his murder.

22:45.909 --> 22:50.073
Then put your own needs aside to help
the city when it most needed a hero.

22:50.780 --> 22:55.080
You've honored the reputation of Batman
many times over and for that I thank you.

22:55.353 --> 22:56.353
Then why?

22:56.953 --> 23:00.753
I had no right to force this life
on you or anyone else.

23:00.990 --> 23:04.018
I was the one who broke in
and swiped the suit, remember?

23:04.694 --> 23:08.757
Yes, there was my dad's murder, but we
come from two different worlds, Mr. Wayne.

23:08.965 --> 23:11.263
I wasn't like you
or the kids you took in.

23:12.803 --> 23:14.999
I was a pretty bad kid once.

23:15.204 --> 23:18.935
Ran with a rough crowd, broke a lot of
laws and say nothing to my folks' hearts.

23:19.542 --> 23:22.705
The kind of punk you wouldn't have wasted
a second punch on back in that day.

23:23.047 --> 23:24.047
Your point?

23:24.816 --> 23:27.214
I'm trying to make
up for past sins.

23:27.984 --> 23:31.615
The state says my 3 months in juvie wiped
me clean, but my soul tells me different.

23:32.257 --> 23:36.125
Every time I put on that suit is my
chance to help people who are in trouble.

23:37.162 --> 23:39.221
I guess on a personal level...

23:39.431 --> 23:42.662
it's a chance to look like
a worthwhile human being again.

23:42.865 --> 23:44.799
In my eyes, no one else's.

23:46.769 --> 23:48.396
It's what I want, Bruce.

23:50.973 --> 23:52.067
Stupid kid.

23:52.576 --> 23:56.240
You don't know what you want.
None of you ever did.

24:29.712 --> 24:33.047
Mom, come quick!
Some weirdo broke into our house!

24:33.317 --> 24:37.584
- Matty? What are you yelling about?
- There's a stranger's sitting at our table!

24:37.788 --> 24:40.654
- Ha, ha.
- That's your brother.

24:42.358 --> 24:44.292
I've never seen him
before in my life.

24:44.494 --> 24:48.364
It is rare that you're up before noon,
Terry what with your job and all.

24:48.700 --> 24:51.166
I'm not working for Mr.
Wayne anymore.

24:53.569 --> 24:56.971
Well, it will be nice to have you home
for a change. Right, Matt?

24:57.173 --> 25:00.871
Sure. Great. Just when I was
getting used to being an only child.

25:03.279 --> 25:04.373
Mom!

25:10.953 --> 25:14.980
Once in a while, we have to do it, Dane.
Ditch the guys and go out by ourselves.

25:15.192 --> 25:19.288
It may be a change for you, Chelsea. I don't
see enough of Terry to know the difference.

25:19.496 --> 25:23.297
Terry's sweet and all, but who says
you can't make friends with someone new?

25:23.500 --> 25:24.557
Not a chance.

25:24.867 --> 25:26.130
Terry!

25:27.238 --> 25:29.536
I thought you'd be
working as usual.

25:30.508 --> 25:33.807
The bad news is, for the time being,
I'm not gonna have much money coming in.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.570
The good news is,
you have me all to yourself.

25:37.181 --> 25:38.875
I can live with that.

25:53.029 --> 25:54.259
Cutting in.

25:58.801 --> 25:59.894
Hey!

26:06.344 --> 26:07.366
Dana?

26:22.092 --> 26:23.092
What is it, boy?

26:25.328 --> 26:26.328
Ace.

26:29.901 --> 26:31.059
Ace!

26:59.364 --> 27:03.992
Don't get up, Bruce. It's just
an old friend come by to say hello.

27:11.907 --> 27:13.204
Hello...

27:13.609 --> 27:15.009
Batman.

27:20.451 --> 27:21.678
Dana!

27:24.954 --> 27:26.444
It was her.

27:48.176 --> 27:48.676
Don't know why the boss

27:49.025 --> 27:50.846
wants a dreg like you
outta the way, but...

27:50.847 --> 27:52.778
hey, as long as it's fun...

27:56.777 --> 27:57.835
Terry!

27:59.443 --> 28:00.443
Dana!

28:03.448 --> 28:05.678
- Let me go!
- Sure, cutes.

28:12.789 --> 28:14.222
Slag him!

28:28.772 --> 28:31.105
- Dana?
- Stay out of sight!

28:50.392 --> 28:51.392
There!

29:05.038 --> 29:06.132
What's he doing?

29:06.340 --> 29:07.740
You got me.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.538
Just finish him!

29:29.964 --> 29:32.832
Ah, you made a mess, dreg.

29:43.942 --> 29:44.942
Dana!

29:44.979 --> 29:48.436
She's got a bad bump and some cuts,
but she's gonna be okay.

29:48.914 --> 29:51.851
- Why were those guys after you?
- I don't know.

29:52.053 --> 29:54.544
Look I'm gonna talk to the cops.
Stay with her, okay, Chels?

29:54.755 --> 29:57.347
- I'll come as soon as I can.
- Sure.

30:13.673 --> 30:15.005
Leave a message.

30:15.209 --> 30:17.871
Hey, the Joker's little playmates
were after me tonight.

30:18.077 --> 30:19.635
Me, not Batman.

30:19.846 --> 30:21.972
This whole thing stinks, Wayne,
and you know why.

30:22.182 --> 30:26.983
I need some straight answers from...
Wait, it's night. Where does he go?

30:48.173 --> 30:49.173
Wayne?

30:49.509 --> 30:50.602
Wayne!

30:55.648 --> 30:56.673
Ace.

31:11.464 --> 31:13.365
Please, God, no.

31:42.028 --> 31:43.028
Floor...

31:46.967 --> 31:48.457
under...

31:50.871 --> 31:52.065
table.

32:27.407 --> 32:28.407
How is he?

32:28.776 --> 32:32.268
The anti-toxin's done all it can.
It's up to him now.

32:32.479 --> 32:35.003
Thanks for coming.
I didn't know who else to call.

32:35.215 --> 32:36.215
Who else is there?

32:36.784 --> 32:40.015
That reminds me. I'd better
check on our other patient.

32:42.756 --> 32:44.690
What have I done?

32:45.358 --> 32:48.351
I killed the little rabbit.

32:48.760 --> 32:52.095
I don't deserve to live!

32:58.403 --> 33:00.167
How you doing, killer?

33:03.611 --> 33:05.806
Yeah, rough night for me too.

33:06.346 --> 33:08.644
Sad news from the financial world
this morning.

33:08.847 --> 33:13.250
The return of Bruce Wayne to his family
company has been delayed due to an accident.

33:13.452 --> 33:16.388
Wayne Enterprises' Jordan Pryce
had this to say:

33:16.589 --> 33:19.787
We received a call from
Mr. Wayne's houseboy this morning...

33:19.993 --> 33:22.484
saying Mr. Wayne
had taken a bad fall.

33:23.096 --> 33:26.826
Everyone at the Wayne Enterprises' family
sends their prayers and good wishes...

33:27.034 --> 33:30.433
to our senior member
for his speedy recovery.

33:31.372 --> 33:34.864
I'll bet. Not every creep in Gotham
wears a purple suit.

33:35.075 --> 33:37.009
It'd make my job
simpler if they did.

33:37.377 --> 33:41.314
The Joker knew about Bruce, about me,
probably about you too.

33:41.847 --> 33:43.476
Someone knows,
I'll give you that.

33:43.851 --> 33:46.580
But it's not the Joker.
Not the real one.

33:47.221 --> 33:48.846
Bruce said he was dead.

33:50.257 --> 33:51.257
And?

33:51.525 --> 33:52.719
That's it.

33:52.926 --> 33:54.690
I know there's more.

33:54.894 --> 33:57.989
Barbara, I'm part of this. I need
the answers Bruce can't give me.

33:58.766 --> 34:00.163
I deserve them.

34:06.406 --> 34:09.103
I thought talking about it
would get easier over time...

34:09.309 --> 34:11.210
but some hurts never go away.

34:12.643 --> 34:14.840
Dick Grayson,
Nightwing, had left...

34:15.047 --> 34:17.710
to establish himself
in another city.

34:18.217 --> 34:22.621
There were three of us then:
Bruce, myself and Robin, Tim Drake.

34:32.231 --> 34:35.929
Robin was alone when
he came upon a woman in trouble.

34:36.469 --> 34:38.460
Help!
Help!

34:38.739 --> 34:40.931
Somebody, please, help!

34:43.610 --> 34:45.009
Hero time.

34:51.451 --> 34:55.411
- That evens things up a little.
- Not really, bird-boy!

35:03.262 --> 35:05.025
A bird in the hand.

35:07.967 --> 35:09.958
We soon realized
Tim was missing.

35:12.072 --> 35:16.132
Night after night we scoured the city,
running down every lead...

35:16.342 --> 35:18.708
pressing every
underworld connection.

35:22.382 --> 35:25.317
But no one had seen
any sign of Robin.

35:25.853 --> 35:29.152
For three agonizing weeks
there was nothing.

35:29.355 --> 35:32.951
Then one night,
we were sent an invitation.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.422
Arkham.

36:06.326 --> 36:09.657
The asylum had been moved
to a newer, high-security building.

36:09.862 --> 36:12.489
The old building had been
partially demolished...

36:12.697 --> 36:15.326
and hung open
like a rotting wound.

36:22.541 --> 36:26.342
Hush, little baby,
don't say a word

36:26.547 --> 36:31.039
Mama's gonna buy
you a mocking bird

36:31.250 --> 36:35.550
And if that
mocking bird don't sing

36:35.755 --> 36:40.250
Mama's gonna buy
you a diamond ring

36:40.460 --> 36:45.396
And if that diamond
ring turns brass

36:45.664 --> 36:50.471
Mama's gonna buy
you a looking glass

36:50.472 --> 36:56.072
And if that looking
glass gets broke

36:57.543 --> 36:59.476
Pudding, company!

37:02.248 --> 37:06.184
Hello there!
Welcome to our happy home.

37:10.523 --> 37:11.648
Where's Robin?

37:12.657 --> 37:13.715
Robin?

37:14.092 --> 37:15.527
There's no Robin here.

37:15.728 --> 37:17.820
Maybe he means our little J.

37:18.197 --> 37:19.893
Of course!
That's it!

37:26.005 --> 37:27.701
No peeking.

37:36.548 --> 37:38.380
Mommy's little helper.

37:41.454 --> 37:45.481
You know, Bats, we've been doing this
little runaround of ours for years.

37:45.724 --> 37:48.818
It's been loads of laughs,
but the sad fact is...

37:49.027 --> 37:50.961
none of us are
getting any younger.

37:51.164 --> 37:53.155
That old clock's a-ticking.

37:53.365 --> 37:54.889
Quite right, pooh.

37:55.268 --> 37:58.704
And Harley and I were thinking
it was time to start a family.

37:58.905 --> 38:02.068
Add a Joker Junior
to our merry brood.

38:02.474 --> 38:05.409
But rather than go through
all the joy of childbirth...

38:05.710 --> 38:08.077
we decided to adopt.

38:09.949 --> 38:11.746
We couldn't do it legally...

38:11.951 --> 38:16.182
but then we remembered you always
had a few spare kids hanging around.

38:16.389 --> 38:18.550
So we borrowed one.

38:22.596 --> 38:23.596
No.

38:23.797 --> 38:25.422
My God!

38:25.731 --> 38:30.192
He needed a little molding of course.
What kid doesn't?

38:30.402 --> 38:33.599
But in time we came
to love him as our own.

38:33.873 --> 38:36.273
Say hello, J.J.

39:08.838 --> 39:10.237
Robin!
Robin!

39:13.543 --> 39:17.411
Tim, it's Barbara.
Can you hear me?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.385
Robin!
Stop!

39:33.463 --> 39:35.157
Hands off,
Brat-girl!

39:35.532 --> 39:38.467
Sweetie, get Mommy's bazooka.

40:06.626 --> 40:08.559
How could you help
Joker do it, Harley?

40:08.994 --> 40:12.452
Okay, so he roughed the kid up
a little, but I'll make it right.

40:13.065 --> 40:15.659
Yeah, you're mother
of the stinking year.

40:15.867 --> 40:17.061
Ha! You'll see.

40:19.338 --> 40:22.568
We'll be one big, happy family.

40:28.648 --> 40:29.648
Good boy!

41:20.365 --> 41:21.856
What's the matter, Batman?

41:23.001 --> 41:25.025
No witty comeback?
No threat?

41:25.599 --> 41:27.804
Then I'll provide the narration.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.000
OUR FAMILY MEMORIES

41:39.748 --> 41:44.686
I'll begin with how I peeled
back the layers of the boy's mind.

41:45.755 --> 41:48.655
Though, he bravely tried
to fight it at first.

42:00.125 --> 42:03.152
You would have been proud
to see him so strong!

42:06.197 --> 42:07.231
But all too soon...

42:07.232 --> 42:10.240
the serums and the shocks
took their toll.

42:10.931 --> 42:15.063
The dear lad began
to share such secrets with me.

42:15.471 --> 42:18.905
Secrets that are
mine alone to know...

42:19.173 --> 42:20.641
Bruce.

42:21.110 --> 42:24.306
It's true, Batsy.
I know everything.

42:24.514 --> 42:27.606
And like the kid who peeks
at his Christmas presents...

42:27.817 --> 42:31.307
I must admit,
it's sadly anticlimactic.

42:31.519 --> 42:34.318
Behind all the Sturm
and batarangs...

42:34.523 --> 42:39.152
you're just a little boy in a
playsuit, crying for Mommy and Daddy.

42:39.527 --> 42:41.929
It'd be funny,
if it weren't so pathetic.

42:43.664 --> 42:46.827
Oh, what the heck!
I'll laugh anyway.

43:00.949 --> 43:04.146
If you don't like the movie,
I've got slides.

43:16.030 --> 43:18.556
I'll break you in two.

43:18.768 --> 43:20.257
Oh, Batman.

43:20.469 --> 43:24.268
If you had the guts for that kind
of fun, you'd have done it years ago.

43:24.472 --> 43:26.668
I, on the other hand...

43:37.516 --> 43:39.246
You've lost, Batman.

43:39.751 --> 43:41.309
Robin is mine.

43:41.519 --> 43:45.355
The last sound you hear
will be our laughter.

43:47.992 --> 43:49.518
Here you go,
sonny-boy.

43:52.831 --> 43:56.898
Make daddy proud.
Deliver the punch line.

44:04.773 --> 44:05.773
Tim.

44:12.568 --> 44:13.568
Do it!

44:19.900 --> 44:23.000
That's not funny.
That's not...

44:48.809 --> 44:51.778
It's okay, Tim.
It's okay.

44:51.914 --> 44:53.849
We buried the Joker
deep beneath Arkham.

44:54.315 --> 44:58.809
The only other person who knew what happened that
night was my father, the first commissioner Gordon.

44:59.820 --> 45:01.318
He promissed to keep our secret.

45:03.423 --> 45:05.324
With his last act of cruelty...

45:05.527 --> 45:10.362
the Joker had tainted us all
with compromise and deception.

45:13.568 --> 45:16.001
I suppose he had
the last laugh after all.

45:16.204 --> 45:18.001
I'm assuming his girlfriend
bought it too.

45:18.306 --> 45:22.298
We never found her body, but I doubt
she'd be starting trouble now.

45:24.313 --> 45:25.313
And Tim?

45:25.514 --> 45:28.175
We had a trusted friend,
Dr. Leslie Thompkins.

45:28.382 --> 45:31.943
It took her a year, but she was able
to help Tim back to sanity.

45:32.152 --> 45:34.679
Still, things were never
really the same.

45:34.989 --> 45:37.355
Bruce forbade Tim
to be Robin again.

45:37.692 --> 45:42.186
He blamed himself for what happened and swore
he'd never endanger another young partner.

45:42.663 --> 45:45.860
Tim left us soon after that,
determined to make it on his own.

45:46.735 --> 45:47.735
Did they patch it up?

45:48.237 --> 45:52.605
Tim tried once or twice, but you
know Bruce. I check up on Tim now and then.

45:52.974 --> 45:56.706
He's a top-level communications
engineer, married, couple kids.

45:57.179 --> 45:59.112
Not too bad,
all things concerned.

45:59.313 --> 46:00.871
He deserved a happy ending.

46:01.516 --> 46:04.485
But he still has the most likely
connection to that night.

46:14.061 --> 46:17.326
It looks okay on this side.
I'm going up to the dish.

46:28.777 --> 46:32.336
You might as well show yourself.
I heard you a mile away.

46:33.280 --> 46:36.876
I'm no Boy Wonder anymore,
but that old training never goes away.

46:37.085 --> 46:38.746
Even at my age.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
Tim Drake.

46:40.788 --> 46:41.981
You heard about Bruce?

46:42.657 --> 46:45.092
Barbara told me.
That was too bad.

46:45.427 --> 46:46.916
You're not too broken up.

46:47.128 --> 46:49.927
I had nothing to do with it,
despite what you might be thinking.

46:50.132 --> 46:53.431
When the Joker reappeared,
I was just as surprised as anyone.

46:53.634 --> 46:55.760
Barb told you the gory details?

46:56.269 --> 46:57.601
More or less.

46:57.806 --> 47:00.000
Look, it's been almost 40 years.

47:00.208 --> 47:03.768
It wasn't easy, but I managed to put
it to bed and go on with my life.

47:03.978 --> 47:08.005
You'll have to do it yourself one day.
We all did.

47:08.215 --> 47:11.844
We gave our best, but in the end that
wasn't good enough for the old man.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.612
Regrets,
Mr. Drake?

47:14.989 --> 47:18.981
When I was younger, part of me thought
I would go on and on and someday....

47:19.827 --> 47:23.286
Capes, costumes, playing hero.
It was kids' stuff.

47:23.498 --> 47:25.260
Bruce probably did me a favor.

47:25.467 --> 47:29.994
In the end I was so sick of it, I never
wanted to see that stupid Robin suit again.

47:32.507 --> 47:34.304
Some things never change.

47:36.376 --> 47:38.346
Were all of you
bitter when you left?

47:38.778 --> 47:40.336
Comes with the territory,
McGinnis.

47:40.847 --> 47:43.077
Look up Nightwing, someday.
He has he got stories!

47:43.384 --> 47:46.318
Drake's clean. I've got
one more lead to check out.

47:46.519 --> 47:48.920
Someone with a definite grudge
against Bruce Wayne.

48:05.684 --> 48:09.253
Caviar, soft music and
charming company.

48:09.599 --> 48:12.149
Amy, my dear,
I can't think of any better way

48:12.150 --> 48:15.192
to celebrate my ascension to
CEO of Wayne Enterprises.

48:15.550 --> 48:17.849
- Me neither.
- Me neither.

48:22.701 --> 48:25.538
You?
Where's Amy?

48:25.539 --> 48:27.063
Missed the boat, I'm afraid.

48:31.277 --> 48:32.505
Turn the yacht around!

48:32.713 --> 48:36.409
Detox, boss man.
We're here to talk business.

48:36.617 --> 48:39.983
We'll be quick.
Woof gets seasick easy.

48:42.489 --> 48:44.581
Our business is concluded.

48:52.398 --> 48:53.989
You've got the equipment
you wanted.

48:54.201 --> 48:57.659
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

48:57.871 --> 49:00.737
while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

49:01.074 --> 49:03.599
Word is Wayne's terminal anyhow.

49:05.143 --> 49:07.510
That means you get
to stay top dog.

49:07.713 --> 49:09.045
And everyone's happy.

49:09.715 --> 49:11.047
So why are you here?

49:11.418 --> 49:16.150
The big guy who originally put us
in contact just decided you're a loose end.

49:16.356 --> 49:18.550
And loose ends
should be tied up.

49:26.199 --> 49:27.632
Let me go!

49:28.001 --> 49:29.228
Got him.

49:29.469 --> 49:32.405
Then amscray pronto, kiddies.

49:35.742 --> 49:37.835
Things are going
to start popping.

49:38.277 --> 49:39.643
Let's go!

49:41.514 --> 49:43.675
No one's leaving
until I get answers.

49:48.021 --> 49:50.420
No, you idiot!
Not now!

49:59.666 --> 50:01.030
They're getting away!

50:02.068 --> 50:03.788
Yeah, and I think they've
got a good reason!

50:07.206 --> 50:09.697
- What's happening?
- Hang on!

50:52.818 --> 50:53.978
We saw the explosion.

50:54.420 --> 50:56.445
You can ask Mr. Pryce
about that.

50:56.657 --> 50:58.851
Me?
I had nothing to do with it.

50:59.059 --> 51:00.253
That right?

51:01.061 --> 51:04.496
I gave you the security codes
so you could ransack the lab...

51:04.697 --> 51:07.291
while those bunglers tried
to kill Wayne.

51:07.501 --> 51:08.695
I want my lawyer.

51:08.902 --> 51:12.735
I think the commissioner would like
to hear this too. Night.

51:29.389 --> 51:30.878
I'm spent.

51:31.324 --> 51:34.817
Every lead I had has gone face-down,
and the Joker's still out there.

51:35.027 --> 51:36.393
What have you got?

51:37.264 --> 51:38.697
I don't know, pup.

51:38.931 --> 51:42.197
If I was the Batman I was supposed
to be, I'd have cracked this...

51:42.402 --> 51:45.371
would have punched the right data
into the computer...

51:45.572 --> 51:48.335
or remembered that one clue
everyone else overlooked.

51:48.675 --> 51:50.302
It's rarely that simple.

51:57.284 --> 51:59.878
- How are you feeling?
- Lousy.

52:02.054 --> 52:03.715
Gordon told me what happened
to Tim Drake.

52:04.523 --> 52:07.925
That's why I didn't want you
going up against the Joker...

52:08.128 --> 52:09.492
impostor or not.

52:09.829 --> 52:13.458
Nothing against your old partners,
but I'm a completely different Batman.

52:13.666 --> 52:15.327
I was never a Robin, I never...

52:19.005 --> 52:20.199
Wait.

52:21.172 --> 52:22.936
Joker smashed up the cases...

52:23.143 --> 52:26.010
but why was this the only costume
he went out of his way to destroy?

52:26.413 --> 52:27.744
Robin did shoot him.

52:28.014 --> 52:31.507
A ghost out for revenge?
I don't buy it. I talked to Drake.

52:31.717 --> 52:34.481
He's got less love
for that costume than the Joker.

52:34.688 --> 52:36.918
I think somehow
he's behind this.

52:37.123 --> 52:38.181
That's crazy.

52:38.391 --> 52:40.451
So was Drake, once.

52:40.661 --> 52:44.563
Look, here's the readout of everything
we know the Jokerz have stolen.

52:47.166 --> 52:50.534
Now let's combine those into something that
would be used by a communications expert.

52:50.971 --> 52:52.699
Someone of Tim Drake's caliber.

52:55.541 --> 52:57.271
Satellite jamming system.

52:57.677 --> 53:00.612
Whoever uses this can access
satellite defense systems...

53:00.813 --> 53:02.179
and fire them at will.

53:02.382 --> 53:03.610
Someone already has.

53:03.949 --> 53:06.077
I suspected Jordan Pryce
might be the Joker...

53:06.286 --> 53:09.380
but the Jokerz were on your
company yacht trying to slag Pryce.

53:09.588 --> 53:12.114
I got him off before
it was blasted to splinters.

53:15.393 --> 53:18.956
I think your little Robin's
turned into a bitter old crow.

53:19.166 --> 53:21.259
He's gotta be the brains
behind this new Joker.

53:21.467 --> 53:23.902
It's harsh,
but who else is there?

53:26.505 --> 53:27.905
Suit up.

53:28.175 --> 53:31.940
Take the car and check it out.
I'll monitor you from here.

53:33.045 --> 53:35.239
What happened to
leaving it to the cops?

53:35.882 --> 53:36.974
Not their game.

53:37.483 --> 53:39.884
There's something else
I want to take with me.

54:04.344 --> 54:07.108
Drake, I know you're
the connection to the Joker.

54:09.815 --> 54:11.909
Don't pretend you
didn't hear me.

54:12.552 --> 54:13.710
Hologram.

54:28.068 --> 54:30.092
You guessed it, Batfake!

54:30.302 --> 54:33.760
The disgruntled Mr. Drake
is indeed in my employ.

54:34.407 --> 54:39.344
Took him a few years, but he figured
out who ran the real winning team.

54:39.579 --> 54:43.106
This is one of Uncle Sam's
orbiting defense satellites.

54:43.315 --> 54:45.784
Hyperion class,
laser-armed.

54:45.985 --> 54:48.920
Handy litlle gadget for shooting down
unfriendly missiles...

54:49.121 --> 54:51.521
or giving someone
a world-class hotfoot.

54:53.960 --> 54:57.224
Think of it as urban tagging
on a grand scale...

54:57.431 --> 55:02.333
reminding all and sundry
that this is Joker territory.

55:02.536 --> 55:04.594
You're welcome to
try and stop us...

55:04.804 --> 55:08.900
but I'm not taking bets on that
happening anytime soon. Toodles.

56:02.762 --> 56:03.956
Miss me?

56:13.106 --> 56:15.402
Computer, search for
the name Jolly Jack.

56:21.081 --> 56:24.244
Abandoned candy factory.
Just his style.

56:24.451 --> 56:26.077
Wayne,
I think I've got something.

56:26.353 --> 56:29.447
Download this transmition and tell Gordon
to have her men at that address.

56:29.655 --> 56:32.590
- I'm gonna...
- Aren't you the nasty tattletale?

56:32.791 --> 56:36.056
Ratting me out
before I have my fun.

56:36.262 --> 56:37.992
Papa spank.

56:56.949 --> 56:57.949
Yeah, I know!

57:42.927 --> 57:45.896
I'd better sit down
before I bust a gut!

57:46.563 --> 57:48.690
Catch you later, kiddo!

57:52.670 --> 57:55.297
It's stopped.
I'm going after him.

58:17.527 --> 58:18.755
Gotcha!

58:42.085 --> 58:43.313
Ace.

58:55.431 --> 58:56.989
Good bat-dog.

59:07.242 --> 59:08.471
Where'd he go?

59:13.248 --> 59:14.409
Watch it!

59:14.617 --> 59:15.947
You watch it!

59:18.121 --> 59:19.418
It's him!

59:38.840 --> 59:40.239
Double down.

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.327
Lovely playroom.
You getting this, Wayne?

01:00:00.762 --> 01:00:03.664
I see it. You keep
your eyes open for the Joker.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:15.277
Tim.

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.603
Get up, Drake.

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.873
What?
Who is it?

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:22.516
Where's the Joker?

01:00:22.818 --> 01:00:23.818
Joker?

01:00:24.018 --> 01:00:26.853
Drop the act.
I know you're working with him.

01:00:27.222 --> 01:00:30.681
No, Joker's gone.
I don't know where he is, really.

01:00:31.293 --> 01:00:34.286
Suit sensors aren't picking up
any pulse fluctuations.

01:00:34.664 --> 01:00:35.789
It's the truth.

01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:39.530
I don't do this anymore.
I have a home and family.

01:00:39.735 --> 01:00:43.467
I gave this up years ago.
Kids' stuff. That's all it was.

01:00:44.306 --> 01:00:46.867
It may be the truth,
but he's still whacked.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.646
Fun and games.
Boy Wonder playing the hero.

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:53.838
Fighting the bad guys
and no one ever gets....

01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:56.146
Oh, God.

01:00:56.686 --> 01:00:58.313
I killed him.

01:00:58.788 --> 01:01:00.516
I didn't mean to.

01:01:00.722 --> 01:01:02.485
I tried so hard to forget.

01:01:02.791 --> 01:01:06.818
But I still hear the shot,
still see his dead smile.

01:01:07.530 --> 01:01:09.360
Every night the
dreams get stronger.

01:01:09.565 --> 01:01:12.159
He's there when I sleep,
whispering, laughing...

01:01:12.367 --> 01:01:15.335
telling me I'm just as bad
as he is, we're both the same.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.434
I'm calling an ambulance.

01:01:17.639 --> 01:01:20.130
No, I'm all right.
Forgive me, Terry.

01:01:20.342 --> 01:01:24.143
Old, nasty memories twisting
inside me like bad oysters.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.347
Nothing really.

01:01:25.847 --> 01:01:27.679
I'm perfectly fine now.

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:29.181
How do you know my name?

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.121
There's nothing about you
I don't know, Batfake.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.222
Terry!

01:01:40.963 --> 01:01:42.692
Have a time-out,
kid.

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:45.492
Can't let you spoil
the party too soon.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:50.297
And Bruce, I'm sure you've got
your monkey-boy wired somehow.

01:01:51.007 --> 01:01:55.034
That's just peachy, because I want you
to see every minute of this.

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.541
It's a killer.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:16.224
My God.

01:02:20.135 --> 01:02:23.400
Oh, I never get tired of that!

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:24.773
Drake?

01:02:25.306 --> 01:02:27.172
You're the Joker?

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:31.811
That flabby oaf doesn't even realize
I'm using him as a time-share.

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:36.246
Beneath this puckish exterior
lies the mind of a genius...

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:38.010
years ahead of my time.

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:41.221
In the weeks young Robin
was under my tutelage...

01:02:41.422 --> 01:02:45.952
l used him as the subject
of my greatest experiment.

01:02:46.161 --> 01:02:49.152
Utilizing cutting-edge
genetics technology...

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:51.264
which I had pinched
here and there...

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:54.833
l encoded my DNA
on a microchip...

01:02:55.036 --> 01:02:57.938
and set it
into bird-boy's birdbrain.

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.898
Here.

01:03:00.108 --> 01:03:04.704
Everything that was me has been
a-sleeping all comfy and cozy...

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:07.780
inside Tim Drake's subconscious.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:12.043
At first, I had to limit the time
I spent in Drake's body.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:13.949
He's not aware of what I do...

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:17.056
chalking up any lingering memories
to bad dreams.

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:20.590
If his family misses him,
I simply call wifey and tell her:

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.958
"l'm working late,
honey."

01:03:23.231 --> 01:03:25.199
The changes come at will now...

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.599
and soon I'll be strong enough
to live in this body permanently.

01:03:29.806 --> 01:03:32.672
Mr. J's on the rebound,
baby!

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:36.902
My comeback party's gonna set
the whole town on fire!

01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:01.934
So where should I
make ground zero?

01:04:02.137 --> 01:04:06.369
Gotham General, where our hero's
dear little Dana is recuperating?

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:11.036
Or here, in the happy garden
of Mrs. Mary McGinnis?

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:16.280
I always think it adds resonance
to a hero's mission...

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:19.648
to have some defining element
of tragedy in his background...

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.221
don't you?

01:04:22.224 --> 01:04:25.592
Ah, but the one and only
kick off point...

01:04:25.795 --> 01:04:28.628
must be stately Wayne Manor.

01:04:28.998 --> 01:04:30.056
Gone in a flash...

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:34.668
before Brucie can hobble to safety
or mount a rescue.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.132
Don't worry, though.

01:04:39.074 --> 01:04:42.373
I'll be hitting
those other spots soon enough.

01:04:43.378 --> 01:04:44.936
Adiós, Brucie.

01:04:45.146 --> 01:04:48.514
I guess I should salute you
as a worthy adversary and all that...

01:04:48.717 --> 01:04:53.018
but the truth is,
I really did hate your guts.

01:04:54.824 --> 01:04:59.318
What about it, kid?
Any last words for the old Batfart?

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:02.056
Yeah. Sic him.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.728
Ace, here!

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:14.670
Attaboy!

01:05:27.489 --> 01:05:30.186
End of the line, Snoopy.

01:05:36.364 --> 01:05:37.364
No!

01:05:52.514 --> 01:05:54.039
Oh, good.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:55.911
The beam's headed here.

01:05:56.117 --> 01:05:58.677
Now I'll have
to start all over again.

01:05:58.887 --> 01:06:02.085
Thanks for wrecking everything, kid.
See you around.

01:06:02.592 --> 01:06:03.889
Hold it.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.291
Oh, wise up, junior.

01:06:06.494 --> 01:06:07.893
Game's over!

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:10.621
- I'm taking you in.
- Right.

01:06:17.405 --> 01:06:19.465
You're out of your league,
McGinnis.

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:24.237
I know every trick the original
Batman and Robin knew at their peak.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.643
Maybe, but you don't know
a thing about me.

01:06:27.882 --> 01:06:28.907
You?

01:06:29.117 --> 01:06:31.052
What's to know?
You're a punk.

01:06:31.253 --> 01:06:32.844
A rank amateur.

01:06:33.054 --> 01:06:37.320
A costumed errand boy taking orders
from a senile old man.

01:06:37.525 --> 01:06:40.619
Still, if it's a whooping
you're wanting....

01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:45.331
That's right.
Better to run and save yourself.

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:47.831
That's about your speed.

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.632
Let's dance, bozo.

01:07:07.222 --> 01:07:09.248
He's tough.
Any suggestions, boss?

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:12.791
Joker is vain and likes to talk and try
to distract you, but don't listen.

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:14.690
Block it out and power through.

01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:15.920
Wait.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.565
I like to talk too.

01:07:20.869 --> 01:07:23.202
- What are you doing?
- Fighting dirty.

01:07:23.405 --> 01:07:25.670
The real Batman would never...

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:28.235
Told you, you didn't know me.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.574
Funny guy.

01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:34.347
Can't say the same for you.

01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:39.913
Impudent brat.
Who do you think you're talking to?

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:42.018
Not a comedian,
I'll tell ya that.

01:07:43.425 --> 01:07:44.518
Shut your mouth!

01:07:46.061 --> 01:07:48.860
The real Batman never
talked to you much, did he?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.362
That's why you were
so fixated on him.

01:07:52.867 --> 01:07:55.893
Don't play psychoanalyst
with me, boy!

01:07:56.271 --> 01:07:58.900
Oh, I don't need a degree
to figure you out.

01:08:01.777 --> 01:08:03.300
The real reason
you kept coming back...

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:06.208
was you never got a laugh
out of the old man.

01:08:06.547 --> 01:08:08.380
I'm not hearing this.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.451
Get a clue, clownie.
He's got no sense of humor.

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:14.349
He wouldn't know a good joke
if it bit him in the cape.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:18.216
- Not that you ever had a good joke.
- Shut up. Shut up!

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.020
I mean, joy buzzers,
squirting flowers? Lame!

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:25.163
Where's the A material? Make a
face, drop your pants, something!

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:26.729
Show yourself!

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:30.804
You make me laugh, but only because
I think you're kind of pathetic.

01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:34.529
Stop that!

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:38.773
You fell in a tank of acid,
got your skin bleached...

01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:40.948
then decided
to become a super villain.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.175
What? You couldn't get work
as a rodeo clown?

01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:49.117
Don't you dare laugh at me!

01:08:51.725 --> 01:08:54.957
Why? I thought the Joker always
wanted to make Batman laugh.

01:08:55.395 --> 01:08:56.886
You're not Batman!

01:09:23.657 --> 01:09:25.145
Come on, McGinnis!

01:09:25.358 --> 01:09:28.792
Laugh it up now,
you miserable little punk! Laugh!

01:09:30.162 --> 01:09:33.096
I can't hear you!

01:10:04.564 --> 01:10:05.860
Easy, I've got you.

01:10:16.042 --> 01:10:17.100
Way ahead of you.

01:11:10.195 --> 01:11:13.529
Delia and Deidre Dennis,
your grandmother's paid your bail.

01:11:13.733 --> 01:11:16.064
You're being released to her custody,
pending your trial.

01:11:16.269 --> 01:11:18.463
- Oh.
- Joy.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.471
You rotten little scamps!

01:11:23.676 --> 01:11:28.170
I struggle to make a good home for you
and this is the thanks I get!

01:11:29.314 --> 01:11:30.838
Break a grandmother's heart!

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:35.487
- I hope they throw the book at you!
- Oh, shut up, Nana Harley.

01:11:39.658 --> 01:11:41.627
You didn't have
to cover up for me, Barbara.

01:11:41.961 --> 01:11:45.828
The Joker's gone, Tim.
You were just along for the ride.

01:11:47.466 --> 01:11:48.661
How are you doing,
Mr. Drake?

01:11:48.868 --> 01:11:50.859
Tim, this is Terry McGinnis.

01:11:51.069 --> 01:11:53.698
- We met the other night.
- We did?

01:11:56.542 --> 01:11:58.033
I owe you big time.

01:11:58.578 --> 01:11:59.636
Forget it.

01:11:59.845 --> 01:12:04.043
For what it's worth, Bruce couldn't have
chosen anyone better to put on the mask.

01:12:05.083 --> 01:12:07.644
Coming from you,
that means everything.

01:12:08.488 --> 01:12:11.650
Sometimes the important things
go unsaid.

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:15.350
If there's one thing I've learned you've got
to appreciate the people in your life...

01:12:15.494 --> 01:12:16.984
while you have the chance.

01:12:17.463 --> 01:12:20.228
Not everyone is capable
of expressing that, Tim.

01:12:20.432 --> 01:12:23.230
No matter how much
they might feel it in their heart.

01:12:23.703 --> 01:12:25.000
I know.

01:12:29.274 --> 01:12:30.332
What are you doing here?

01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:32.337
It's where I should be.

01:12:35.747 --> 01:12:36.747
Terry.

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:41.012
I've been thinking about
what you once told me.

01:12:41.954 --> 01:12:43.081
You were wrong.

01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:46.354
It's not Batman
that makes you worthwhile.

01:12:47.594 --> 01:12:49.528
It's the other way around.

01:12:49.929 --> 01:12:52.261
Never tell yourself
anything different.

01:12:53.432 --> 01:12:54.729
Thanks.

01:13:02.574 --> 01:13:03.974
Hello, Tim.

01:13:05.278 --> 01:13:07.006
Hi, old man.
