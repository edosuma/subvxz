WEBVTT

00:04.602 --> 00:05.876
So we're agreed?

00:05.882 --> 00:07.119
Totally agreed.

00:07.125 --> 00:09.391
- You and I can never have sex again.
- Right.

00:10.554 --> 00:12.476
- [sighs]
- Starting when?

00:13.148 --> 00:14.476
Now!

00:14.482 --> 00:17.640
I mean, yeah, the sex was,
like, the best I've ever had,

00:17.646 --> 00:19.874
but doing it again will
lead to doing it again,

00:19.880 --> 00:21.399
which will lead to one or
both of us having feelings,

00:21.404 --> 00:22.756
which will lead to a
relationship, which will

00:22.761 --> 00:24.685
lead to us breaking up, which will
lead to you not being able to focus

00:24.690 --> 00:26.387
on work which means you
won't be making any new apps

00:26.392 --> 00:27.593
which will lead to the economy tanking,

00:27.598 --> 00:29.297
causing the world to
completely fall apart!

00:32.503 --> 00:34.598
- Best you've ever had, huh?
- Josh!

00:34.793 --> 00:36.455
Look, I get it.

00:36.461 --> 00:38.723
You and I in a relationship don't work.

00:38.729 --> 00:40.740
We've tried... and failed.

00:40.746 --> 00:43.066
Exactly, so you have
to get out of here now.

00:43.072 --> 00:46.535
Okay? If Sofia walks in and she
sees this, she's gonna kill me.

00:46.541 --> 00:48.935
- Because we broke a lamp?
- We broke a lamp?

00:48.941 --> 00:50.453
- Up top.
- No.

00:50.459 --> 00:52.279
No, no, no. You don't understand, okay?

00:52.285 --> 00:53.825
Sofia has spent so many hours

00:53.831 --> 00:56.399
and texts and tequila shots
counseling me about you,

00:56.405 --> 00:57.882
and she can't find out about this!

00:57.888 --> 00:59.872
Relax. She won't find out from me.

00:59.878 --> 01:02.137
She will if she comes in
here and you're all nakedy!

01:02.143 --> 01:03.847
- [door unlocking]
- Oh, my God, she's here!

01:03.852 --> 01:05.535
Uh... go out the window,
go out the window!

01:05.541 --> 01:07.025
Go out... No! Go out the window!

01:13.055 --> 01:14.750
What are you doing?

01:15.038 --> 01:16.256
Naked cleaning.

01:16.437 --> 01:17.852
I should take a picture.

01:18.258 --> 01:20.483
Why? 'Cause I look so sexy?

01:21.674 --> 01:23.362
- No, 'cause you're cleaning.
- Oh.

01:23.368 --> 01:24.926
- Oh, my God! Spider!
- Where?

01:24.932 --> 01:26.582
- Turn around! It's over there!
- [wails]

01:26.588 --> 01:27.791
I got it!

01:28.075 --> 01:29.275
[clattering]

01:29.973 --> 01:31.173
Spider guts.

01:31.870 --> 01:33.642
Okay, well, you just have fun cleaning.

01:33.648 --> 01:36.074
I'm gonna try to get some
sleep before my boss calls me.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.987
- [phone rings]
- Ugh. Dammit!

01:38.184 --> 01:39.389
[sighs]

01:39.395 --> 01:40.764
Hi, Logan.

01:40.770 --> 01:43.082
No, of course I'm not in bed.

01:45.753 --> 01:47.143
Here, take this. Go.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.378
This is your shirt.

01:48.384 --> 01:50.457
Yeah, it's San Francisco.
No one will notice.

01:52.383 --> 01:53.583

02:14.164 --> 02:16.829
So, ah, our first day
after [whispers] the sex

02:16.835 --> 02:18.795
[normal voice] went pretty
well, wouldn't you say?

02:19.511 --> 02:21.420
- Haven't thought about it once.
- Me either.

02:21.426 --> 02:23.221
- You lying? Yep.
- Yep. You?

02:23.894 --> 02:26.607
But the important thing is it's
the weekend. I don't have to see you

02:26.613 --> 02:28.701
'cause I will be here and
you will be at your apartment.

02:28.706 --> 02:30.315
- [door opening]
- Get this.

02:30.321 --> 02:32.372
We are kicked out of our
apartment for the weekend.

02:32.378 --> 02:33.581
- No!
- What?

02:34.070 --> 02:35.978
Our building has termites.

02:35.984 --> 02:38.692
[Yolanda laughs] Sucks for you guys!

02:39.855 --> 02:41.973
Wait a minute, that's my building too!

02:43.184 --> 02:45.720
Yeah. Our building is
getting tented tomorrow

02:45.726 --> 02:48.005
and the landlord is
putting us up at a hotel.

02:48.011 --> 02:50.019
The Pacific Resort.

02:50.499 --> 02:52.357
More like The Last Resort!

02:53.419 --> 02:55.716
That place got fake crab in the buffet

02:55.722 --> 02:57.230
and real crabs in the bed!

02:59.048 --> 03:00.743
Wait, how would you know?

03:01.428 --> 03:03.582
Remember when I had that
affair with the senator?

03:03.588 --> 03:05.221
[chuckles]

03:05.748 --> 03:07.718
Yeah, well, you guys,
we don't have a choice.

03:07.724 --> 03:08.995
We have nowhere else to stay.

03:09.783 --> 03:10.986
Josh!

03:10.992 --> 03:12.722
You got a lot of extra rooms here.

03:12.728 --> 03:14.205
That I do, that I do!

03:15.075 --> 03:19.499
In fact, you've got rooms I've
never even been in! [chuckles]

03:19.505 --> 03:21.216
But I've cleaned somehow!

03:22.184 --> 03:24.725
The point is, how about
giving us some of those rooms?

03:24.731 --> 03:25.931
No!

03:26.184 --> 03:30.098
I just feel like that hotel
sounds like so much fun!

03:30.518 --> 03:32.558
Yeah! It's an exciting adventure!

03:33.010 --> 03:36.018
An adventure that ends with
a trip to the free clinic!

03:38.064 --> 03:40.861
Josh, is there some reason
you don't want us to stay here?

03:40.867 --> 03:43.990
Pfft. [high-pitched] No, no, no.

03:43.996 --> 03:45.967
I mean, look, I don't
know what the big deal is.

03:45.973 --> 03:47.585
I think you guys are blowing
this way out of proportion.

03:47.590 --> 03:50.404
There is absolutely no reason
whatsoever why you can't sleep with me.

03:52.992 --> 03:54.470
- All of you.
- Huh?

03:54.476 --> 03:55.676
In my home.

03:56.658 --> 03:59.376
Well... well, great. It's settled then.

04:00.768 --> 04:04.439
Gabi, is it gonna be a problem
for you to sleep at Josh's?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.649
[high-pitched] No, no, no.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.149
Why... why would it be?

04:08.155 --> 04:10.032
Well, because you finally
got to a good place with him

04:10.037 --> 04:12.975
and I don't want the situation
turning into a big, dramatic nightmare.

04:12.981 --> 04:14.699
Sofia, it's gonna be fine.

04:14.705 --> 04:16.070
I meant for me.

04:17.180 --> 04:20.081
Look, there's gonna be
no drama for anybody.

04:20.087 --> 04:21.921
Definitely not from
me. I'm happy to help.

04:21.927 --> 04:23.312
[chuckles] Hey...

04:23.318 --> 04:25.099
what if I bought everybody houses?

04:31.568 --> 04:32.769

04:38.744 --> 04:41.401

04:45.001 --> 04:46.713
[sobs]

04:46.719 --> 04:49.417
Elliot, I know you're hurt,

04:49.423 --> 04:51.867
but we knew this could
happen with a foster child.

04:51.873 --> 04:54.946
You should be happy.
Keisha's with her family now.

04:55.764 --> 04:58.865
What does some third
cousin have that we don't?

04:58.871 --> 05:00.865
Legal rights and a ranch in Victorville.

05:01.573 --> 05:03.142
Keisha will be fine.

05:03.148 --> 05:04.695
It's you I'm worried about.

05:04.701 --> 05:06.796
Please don't say her name.

05:06.802 --> 05:09.770
It makes my head pound
and my heart ache.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.849
From now on, let's
just refer to her as...

05:13.239 --> 05:14.563
Pineapple.

05:15.056 --> 05:16.794
Okay, okay.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.533
Why Pineapple?

05:19.257 --> 05:21.524
'Cause I love...

05:21.530 --> 05:23.576
[sobs] pineapple!

05:24.094 --> 05:25.571
All right, that's it.

05:25.577 --> 05:26.777
We gotta get out of here.

05:26.783 --> 05:28.883
We're spending the next
few days in a luxury hotel

05:28.889 --> 05:31.377
with a jacuzzi tub and a
beautiful view of the city.

05:31.383 --> 05:34.584
[muffled dialog]

05:35.330 --> 05:36.665
You're right!

05:36.671 --> 05:39.142
Why spend the money when
Josh has a beautiful view?

05:39.148 --> 05:41.947
But wait, the girls are already
there. He doesn't need us there too.

05:41.953 --> 05:45.101
[muffled dialog]

05:45.107 --> 05:46.312
You're right!

05:46.318 --> 05:49.252
We'll let him know you're
in tears and devastated.

05:49.258 --> 05:50.590
We'll guilt him into it.

05:50.869 --> 05:53.071
How did the Jewish guy
not come up with that?

05:58.777 --> 06:01.294
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I get to sleep in a house

06:01.300 --> 06:04.081
where the oven and the heater
are two separate things.

06:05.246 --> 06:09.191
I can't wait to sleep on
one of Josh's king size beds!

06:09.197 --> 06:12.322
[inhales] Don't you need
a King Kong size bed?

06:13.718 --> 06:15.154
See, Elliot?

06:15.160 --> 06:17.396
You sound like your old self again!

06:17.402 --> 06:19.458
[chuckles] Okay, I made
breakfast for everybody.

06:19.464 --> 06:22.155
Waffles with bananas,
strawberries, and pineapple.

06:22.161 --> 06:25.091
[sobbing] Pineapple!

06:27.074 --> 06:28.457
Hey!

06:28.463 --> 06:30.068
Look at us.

on your laptop.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.821
Yeah, we can... we can
definitely do this for a few days.

06:37.827 --> 06:39.343
Absolutely.

06:39.349 --> 06:40.823
Oh, shoot.

You're rich. Buy new pants.

- Hi.

07:41.047 --> 07:43.175

07:43.234 --> 07:46.736
Yeah, me neither. But not because
anything is on my mind. [scoffs]

Yeah. Me neither. [chuckles]

07:49.387 --> 07:51.441
Hey, ah, you know what helps? Hot cocoa.

07:51.447 --> 07:52.972
- I'll get the marshmallows.
- Okay.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.064
Gah!

07:57.660 --> 07:59.154
Why is there duct tape on the fridge?

07:59.160 --> 08:02.067
Oh, Yolanda sleepwalk eats,
so she taped it closed.

08:02.889 --> 08:04.094
What?

08:04.100 --> 08:06.377
She eats in her sleep,
so she taped it...

08:06.383 --> 08:07.583
It's a whole thing.

08:11.483 --> 08:13.772
- So this is nice.
- [loudly] So nice.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.669
You know, in the old days,

08:16.675 --> 08:19.408
this would have been awkward,
but now that we're just friends...

08:19.414 --> 08:20.887
- Great friends.
- Amazing friends.

08:20.893 --> 08:22.449
In fact, we should watch <i>Friends.</i>

[Gabi giggling] Oh, my
God, we did it again.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.130
(Josh) Yeah, we did.

08:56.634 --> 08:58.687
Yeah, but we said
we'd never do it again.

09:00.138 --> 09:01.338
But we did.

09:02.286 --> 09:03.730
- [thump]
- [gasps] What was that?

09:03.736 --> 09:04.936
(Josh) I don't know.

09:07.052 --> 09:08.252
[Gabi gasps]

09:08.825 --> 09:10.747
Yolanda, it's not what it looks like.

09:10.753 --> 09:12.085
It didn't look like
anything until you just said,

09:12.090 --> 09:13.290
"It's not what it looks like."

09:13.957 --> 09:16.284

09:17.588 --> 09:18.940

09:18.947 --> 09:20.150
- Is she sleeping?
- [snoring]

09:20.156 --> 09:22.127
Oh, my God, she's sleepwalk eating!

09:22.133 --> 09:23.916
- That's really a thing?
- Yes!

09:23.922 --> 09:25.237
Oh, my God, this is great!

09:25.243 --> 09:26.713
Now she won't even remember this!

09:26.719 --> 09:28.161
Here you go.

09:28.575 --> 09:30.597
There ya go.

09:31.005 --> 09:34.201
I don't know. Okay, we gotta get out
of here before anybody catches us.

09:34.207 --> 09:35.857
Yes, Logan, hi.

09:35.863 --> 09:37.863
[sighs] No, of course I'm up.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.441
[chuckles wryly] Who isn't up
at 4:00 in the morning? [sighs]

09:40.447 --> 09:44.158
Oh, of course I remembered
your ice-cold kombucha.

09:44.164 --> 09:45.759
[panting]

09:45.765 --> 09:47.316
[whispers] What is kombucha?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.369
Please have kombucha!

09:50.068 --> 09:51.833
Yes! Kombucha!

09:51.839 --> 09:53.039
Okay.

09:53.165 --> 09:54.837
This is your dream job.

09:54.843 --> 09:56.334
This is my stepping stone.

09:56.703 --> 09:59.397
And one day, I'm gonna wake
assistants up at 4:00 in the morning

09:59.403 --> 10:01.875
and ask them to hand-deliver
dirt-colored drinks made of...

10:02.024 --> 10:04.227
yeast and bacteria. Ugh.

10:12.071 --> 10:13.719
This is not funny, okay?

10:13.725 --> 10:14.995
Do you understand how close we came

10:15.000 --> 10:16.403
- to getting...

Why isn't Elliot sleeping with Alan?

much, sweet Pineapple!

10:24.599 --> 10:26.226
Thank God he's out.

10:26.232 --> 10:28.645
Oh, my God, I can't believe
we almost got caught again.

10:28.652 --> 10:31.385
- But we weren't.
- Yeah, but we could be the next time.

10:32.187 --> 10:34.179
- There's gonna be a next time?
- Yes!

10:34.304 --> 10:35.509
No!

10:35.515 --> 10:37.249
I mean, maybe a little hand stuff...

10:37.255 --> 10:39.426
No! Nothing! Okay? We need help!

10:43.464 --> 10:45.167
Okay, there you are.

10:46.268 --> 10:48.544
- Alan, we have a huge problem.
- Yeah.

10:48.550 --> 10:50.748
And you can't tell
anybody, especially Sofia.

10:50.753 --> 10:53.842
Well, my hands are beyond full
with Elliot's grieving process.

10:53.848 --> 10:56.529
But you are letting us stay
here for free, so talk to me.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.374
- We're having sex.
- Together?

11:00.380 --> 11:02.397
I thought you two decided
to be just friends.

11:02.403 --> 11:04.896
Yeah, we did, but our parts didn't.

11:05.224 --> 11:08.192
So then what's the
problem? Is the sex bad?

11:08.198 --> 11:10.460
- No, it's good.
- Mm-hmm.

11:10.466 --> 11:13.242
Yeah, but if we keep doing it,
it's gonna lead to a relationship,

11:13.248 --> 11:14.950
and you saw what
happens when we try that.

11:14.956 --> 11:17.934
So, just stop the sex before
you start having feelings.

11:17.940 --> 11:21.059
Okay, but how are we gonna know
which sex time that's gonna be?

11:21.065 --> 11:23.458
Well, how many times do you
two think you could do it

11:23.464 --> 11:24.787
before all the emotions kick in?

11:24.793 --> 11:26.343
- Um, 11?
- A hundred?

11:27.115 --> 11:28.427
A hundred?

11:28.433 --> 11:30.537
I have a lot of walls up.

11:31.295 --> 11:32.917
Let's just play it safe and go with 10.

11:32.923 --> 11:33.996
That sounds fair.

11:34.002 --> 11:36.306
But the important thing
is you can't go over.

11:36.311 --> 11:39.156
Would you like me to keep track? You
can text me right after you do it.

11:39.162 --> 11:40.509
- Uh...
- No.

11:40.844 --> 11:42.044
[knocking]

11:42.050 --> 11:44.613
Knock, knock! Who's up for Froyo?

11:44.806 --> 11:46.647
Josh, will you pay? My treat.

11:47.994 --> 11:49.408
How is that your treat?

11:49.603 --> 11:52.025
My treat is that I
get the fifth one free

11:52.031 --> 11:53.890
thanks to my punch card.

11:53.896 --> 11:55.498
Oh... hey!

11:55.897 --> 11:57.198
A punch card.

11:57.204 --> 11:59.770
- Th-Th-that's my card. Get your own.
- Yeah.

11:59.776 --> 12:01.870
Josh, we should get our own.

12:01.876 --> 12:04.876
Here, give them some money. You guys,
go to Froyo. Get as much as you want,

12:04.882 --> 12:06.838
but bring us back two new punch cards.

12:06.844 --> 12:08.044
[chuckles]

12:09.812 --> 12:11.931
- Sex punch cards. That's genius.
- Mm-hmm.

12:11.937 --> 12:15.132
Yeah! Okay, so each
card has five punches,

12:15.138 --> 12:17.009
and one punch equals one...
[makes clicking sound]

12:17.014 --> 12:20.568
so 10 punches equals 10...
[makes clicking sound]

12:20.745 --> 12:22.675
It is so hot when you add like that.

12:22.681 --> 12:25.509
Mm-hmm. So, uh, do you want
to use one of your punches now?

12:25.515 --> 12:27.310
I do. Wait...

12:27.365 --> 12:28.720
We only get five each.

12:28.726 --> 12:30.345
Maybe we should save it for a rainy day.

12:30.351 --> 12:31.577
- Really?
- Check the weather.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.444
- It's gonna rain later, baby.
- Yay!

12:34.935 --> 12:36.135
[makes clicking sound]

12:43.239 --> 12:45.473
[slurring] There's my man.

12:46.244 --> 12:49.011
Where have you been
all day? I missed you.

12:49.017 --> 12:51.347
Well, someone's in a better mood.

12:51.541 --> 12:52.947
What put that beautiful

12:52.953 --> 12:55.763
- purple smile on your face?
- [chuckles]

12:56.099 --> 12:57.968
Did you drink a whole bottle of wine?

12:57.974 --> 12:59.395
Nope.

12:59.401 --> 13:00.974
One and a half!

13:02.795 --> 13:05.258
Can I offer you some...

13:05.264 --> 13:07.277
Oh, my God, where did you get this?

13:07.283 --> 13:08.772
Sweetie, you got that.

13:08.778 --> 13:09.978
[gasps]

13:11.045 --> 13:13.746
This is a $4,000 bottle of wine.

13:14.058 --> 13:17.388
Elon Musk saved it from a shipwreck

13:17.394 --> 13:21.013
and gave it to Josh to
make him feel inadequate.

13:21.019 --> 13:24.111
You drank a $4,000 bottle of wine?

13:24.117 --> 13:25.983
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh,
my God. We gotta replace it.

13:25.988 --> 13:28.043
Replace it? With whose money?

13:28.049 --> 13:29.849
We'll just have to
tell Joshua the truth.

13:29.855 --> 13:32.881
Or we can get a cheap bottle of wine,

13:32.887 --> 13:34.737
a funnel, and a candle.

13:34.743 --> 13:37.433
Darling, sex isn't the
solution to everything.

13:37.439 --> 13:39.825
[groans] Just... just come with me.

13:43.894 --> 13:45.619
- [door opens]
- Hi, Gabi.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.277
Hey, is it raining yet?

13:48.802 --> 13:50.609
I don't know. [sighs]

13:50.615 --> 13:53.343
I'm so tired. I've had my eyes
closed since Market Street.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.007
All I want is a hot
shower and a wide bed.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.613
- Oh!
- Oh, God! I'm so sorry!

13:57.619 --> 13:59.240
- No, it's okay.
- I'm so sorry.

13:59.246 --> 14:01.310
It's all right. It's okay.
Just go take your shower.

14:01.316 --> 14:02.516
Okay.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.039
You know you're not at home, right?

14:10.629 --> 14:13.631
Yolanda, which one's the hottest,
steamiest shower in the house?

14:13.727 --> 14:15.627
Josh's master bath.

14:15.633 --> 14:18.525
It has an amazing pulsing shower head.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.798
Hey, Yolanda, where's the stain stick?

14:21.804 --> 14:23.168
- [thunder crashing]
- [gasps]

14:23.174 --> 14:24.619
Ooh, rain! Hurry!

14:25.579 --> 14:28.752
Gabi! Gabi, it's...

14:28.758 --> 14:30.300
raining. Oh.

14:30.446 --> 14:32.664
She is one step ahead of me.

14:34.581 --> 14:35.840
Fah!

14:36.245 --> 14:39.449
One punch coming right up.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.993
[Sofia and Josh scream]

14:49.390 --> 14:52.076
Why the hell would you walk
in on someone in the shower?

14:52.082 --> 14:53.205
[gasps]

14:53.211 --> 14:56.046
I thought that was you in the shower.

14:56.289 --> 14:58.392
You just walked in?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.316
Josh, that's sick!

15:01.636 --> 15:04.761
Just cut it out, you two.
I'm tired. I'm not an idiot.

15:05.050 --> 15:06.349
Wait, Sofia.

15:06.355 --> 15:08.553
I can't believe you
guys are at it again.

15:08.559 --> 15:11.701
Gabi, you-you-you... you're
with him, you're without him,

15:11.707 --> 15:13.082
you love him, you hate him,

15:13.088 --> 15:15.081
you're over him, you're under him.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.741
I just can't... I can't take it anymore.

15:17.747 --> 15:20.212
Yeah, well, see, Sofia, this is
exactly why I didn't tell you.

15:20.218 --> 15:22.243
You know, you're just...
you're not very sensitive.

15:22.249 --> 15:24.745
You... Do you understand
how many hours of my life

15:24.751 --> 15:27.018
I've spent on your drama? I'm done.

15:27.781 --> 15:30.162
No, no, no. Listen, Sofia,
you don't understand, okay?

15:30.168 --> 15:31.623
This time is gonna be different.

15:31.629 --> 15:34.294
Josh and I figured out a way so
we don't end up in a relationship.

15:34.300 --> 15:36.346
A sex punch card.

15:36.460 --> 15:37.660
What?

15:37.666 --> 15:39.877
No, we can only have
sex 10 times so that way,

15:39.883 --> 15:41.288
- we don't fall for each other.
- [elevator dings]

15:41.293 --> 15:44.893
Gabi, that is the stupidest
idea I've ever heard.

15:45.460 --> 15:50.146
Yeah, well, it's not as stupid as
leaving in a towel. [fake gasps]

15:54.289 --> 15:56.307
Great news. It's still raining.

15:56.313 --> 15:57.696
What happened with Sofia?

15:57.702 --> 15:59.697
I don't want to talk about
it. I want to use a punch.

15:59.702 --> 16:02.366
Right now? But I thought you
guys... Okay, we'll talk after.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.655
Stupid Sofia acting all judgy just
'cause you and I are sleeping together.

16:09.274 --> 16:10.759
Yeah, we are.

16:11.761 --> 16:13.954
I mean, it's not like I
never listen to her problems.

16:13.960 --> 16:15.629
I'm there for her every
single time she needs me.

16:15.634 --> 16:17.994
- Am I wrong? Am I wrong?
- You are right. You are so right.

16:18.795 --> 16:20.498
I mean, I expect her to be a little

16:20.504 --> 16:21.945
annoyed, but once I
explained everything,

16:21.950 --> 16:24.232
I thought she'd be a
little more understating.

16:24.695 --> 16:28.227
Okay, I can't believe I'm about to say
this, but can you please get off of me?

16:29.219 --> 16:30.835
You don't want to have sex with me?

16:31.180 --> 16:33.485
No, I very much want
to have sex with you,

16:33.491 --> 16:34.953
but not when you're
preoccupied with Sofia

16:34.958 --> 16:36.582
because then it's like I'm
having sex with both of you,

16:36.587 --> 16:38.051
which is exactly what I don't want.

16:38.057 --> 16:39.990
[emphatically] I don't want.

16:40.157 --> 16:42.250
Okay, so do you want
to use a punch or not?

16:42.382 --> 16:45.663
Gabi, the punch card is
supposed to be fun. Is this fun?

16:45.669 --> 16:48.293
No, of course it's not fun! I'm upset!

16:48.299 --> 16:50.051
I can't believe how much
she overreacted. I mean,

16:50.056 --> 16:52.886
just because she has this new
job working for a crazy woman who

16:52.892 --> 16:55.129
runs her ragged day and night,
I mean, that's not my fault.

16:55.134 --> 16:57.490
[gasps] Oh, my God, that is so my fault.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.996
I didn't even ask her about
her new job. I'm so selfish!

17:01.002 --> 17:03.963
Hey, you're not selfish.

17:03.969 --> 17:05.278
I get it.

17:05.431 --> 17:07.656
Sometimes it's hard to resist this.

17:09.845 --> 17:11.278
Yeah, I gotta go talk to Sofia.

17:11.284 --> 17:12.619
Okay, you go. Hey, you know what?

17:12.626 --> 17:14.933
Run like the wind. Hurry up.
Take the Porsche. Hurry back.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.069
Good as new. I can't
even tell the difference.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.692
Josh will never be the wiser.

17:24.698 --> 17:26.284
You're brilliant, Elliot.

17:29.263 --> 17:30.506
What?

17:30.778 --> 17:33.935
Do you realize it's been like three
hours since you mentioned her name?

17:33.941 --> 17:35.803
[gasps] Oh, my God. Keisha.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.209
You didn't say "Pineapple"!

17:37.215 --> 17:39.775
And I'm not in hysterics.

17:39.781 --> 17:41.381
- Why do you think?
- Why do you think?

17:41.680 --> 17:43.680
Drinking made me forget?

17:44.075 --> 17:47.786
Or maybe you just needed
a little time to process,

17:47.792 --> 17:50.081
to realize that Keisha's
happy with her family...

17:50.087 --> 17:52.310
on a farm. They have an emu.

17:52.987 --> 17:55.768
Which is a kind of... goat?

17:55.774 --> 17:57.168
Flightless bird.

17:57.268 --> 18:00.363
Oh. Flightless bird sounds fun, too.

18:00.369 --> 18:01.745
You know what else sounds fun?

18:02.461 --> 18:04.163
Taking down the swing
we bought for Keisha

18:04.169 --> 18:06.475
and putting up the one we bought for us?

18:07.054 --> 18:09.021
- He's back!
- [chuckles]

18:13.596 --> 18:14.801
Sofia?

18:16.044 --> 18:17.329
Is it safe to be in here?

18:17.512 --> 18:19.533
Well, the rat in the
hallway looked fine.

18:21.961 --> 18:23.299
(Both) I'm sorry.

18:23.305 --> 18:25.078
Wait, why are you sorry?

18:25.084 --> 18:27.759
Oh, because you overreacted
about me and Josh

18:27.765 --> 18:29.588
because you're overwhelmed
about your new job

18:29.594 --> 18:31.399
that I'm so sorry I
never asked you about?

18:32.280 --> 18:33.572
No, it's okay, Gabi.

18:33.578 --> 18:35.650
I-I know that when it
comes to you and Josh,

18:35.656 --> 18:37.822
you get a little crazy,
and it happened to me too.

18:37.828 --> 18:40.814
You know, at this new job,
I have to be so professional

18:40.820 --> 18:42.486
and-and stuff all my feelings down,

18:42.492 --> 18:44.831
and I guess I just took
it out on you and Josh.

18:44.837 --> 18:46.165
It felt so good!

18:46.171 --> 18:49.469
Aww. Well, listen, you
can vent to me anytime.

18:49.475 --> 18:51.672
Well, you can tell me the
truth about you and Josh.

18:51.945 --> 18:54.251
Okay, good, because
there's one more thing.

18:54.257 --> 18:56.868
Um, do you remember
that lamp that you love?

18:58.860 --> 19:00.902
Josh broke it.

19:04.653 --> 19:07.657
Well, you know, now
that I have this new job,

19:07.746 --> 19:11.121
- maybe I can steal one from work.
- Oh, there you go! That's my girl.

19:11.127 --> 19:13.025
And listen, you were so
right about this punch card.

19:13.030 --> 19:14.982
It's so stupid. I know I
shouldn't be sleeping with Josh.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.735
It messes everything up, even us.

19:17.145 --> 19:19.627
So, you know what? It ends right now.

19:22.496 --> 19:23.932
Aww.

19:23.938 --> 19:25.799
You ripped up your
sex punch card for me.

19:25.804 --> 19:27.771
Mm-hmm. Because you are my best friend.

19:27.777 --> 19:29.044
And you are mine.

19:29.050 --> 19:32.147
You know, all this punch card
talk makes me want some Froyo.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.671
Oh, okay.

19:33.677 --> 19:35.844
Well, my treat to congratulate you

19:35.850 --> 19:37.741
on your new job as...

19:40.031 --> 19:43.330
- Assistant to Logan Rawlings. Yeah.
- Assistant to Logan Rawlings!

19:43.844 --> 19:46.556
Yes! That is such a cool job!

19:50.046 --> 19:53.845
(Gabi) Um, you know what? I actually...
I think I forgot my... wallet.

20:01.657 --> 20:04.180
(Sofia) Scotch tape's
on top of the fridge!

20:06.540 --> 20:08.278
You're the best!

20:10.570 --> 20:13.436
See, sweetie? This is
the perfect distraction.

20:13.590 --> 20:14.918
You're right.

20:14.924 --> 20:16.926
Haven't cried about
Keisha leaving in days.

20:16.932 --> 20:19.025
And nothing will ever replace her,

20:19.031 --> 20:21.563
but it does help to have
another little girl to love.

20:23.312 --> 20:25.437
Isn't that right, Yentl?

20:27.648 --> 20:31.124
And look, Josh sent us a gift
to congratulate us on the puppy.

20:31.335 --> 20:34.617
Oh, my God, it's the
$4,000 bottle of wine.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.744
You know what we're gonna do with that.
