00:19.292 --> 00:23.917
- Here comes my sweet guitar solo!
- Ooh, yeah!

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Now all this show needs
is a little pyrotechnics!

00:31.833 --> 00:35.167
Ooh, looks like you guys are all warmed up
for the Skylands Music Festival.

00:35.250 --> 00:38.000
Oh, yeah! And who doesn't love
a team mission that involves

00:38.083 --> 00:41.042
saving the Skylands
and some serious rock and roll?

00:41.125 --> 00:44.042
All right, Skylanders,
we're deep undercover on this one.

00:44.125 --> 00:46.083
Our intelligence says that Wolfgang

00:46.167 --> 00:47.958
could be targeting the festival
for an attack.

00:48.042 --> 00:51.542
So, we'll need to blend into the crowd
to keep our eyes peeled for him.

00:51.625 --> 00:55.292
Which is why I've been practicing
my own sweet rock and roll moves!

00:55.375 --> 01:01.708
Whoo-hoo!
Yeah! Yeah!

01:01.792 --> 01:03.125
Uh, what is he doing?

01:03.208 --> 01:05.125
No idea.
But I hope he doesn't pull something.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.208
Yeah!

01:06.292 --> 01:09.792
Oh! Ooh, ooh,
I think I just pulled something.

01:41.875 --> 01:46.958
Oh! Oh, that's the stuff.
Right, now, before we head to the show,

01:47.042 --> 01:48.667
let's make sure we have the essentials.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.958
-Sunscreen?
-Check.

01:50.042 --> 01:51.583
-First aid kit?
-Check.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.917
- Earplugs?
- Check.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.125
Ah, suit yourself.
They're your ears.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.125
But one day,
I'm going to have to tell you,

01:57.208 --> 01:58.958
"I told you so!"

01:59.750 --> 02:00.792
Point made.

02:00.875 --> 02:05.208
Yo, Pop. Are you stoked about
the Skylands Music Festival, too?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.750
Absolutely! I'm just perfecting a potion

02:07.833 --> 02:11.167
that'll keep the crowd from falling under
Wolfgang's hypnotic spell,

02:11.250 --> 02:13.292
and then I'll be ready to go!

02:13.375 --> 02:16.917
Oh, man, I hate that guy!

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
Why does Pop hate Wolfgang so much?

02:19.583 --> 02:20.833
I mean, you know, beyond the obvious

02:20.917 --> 02:22.292
"we're the good guys,
he's the bad guy" thing?

02:22.375 --> 02:25.958
Ah, of course, you have no idea about
Pop's history with Wolfgang, do you?

02:26.042 --> 02:28.125
-Uh, no?
-What history?

02:28.208 --> 02:31.958
Tell us, JV, we're all ears.
Well, they are at least.

02:32.042 --> 02:35.333
Right then. So, you see,
once upon a couple decades ago,

02:35.417 --> 02:37.708
Pop Fizz was in a rock duo with Wolfgang.

02:37.792 --> 02:40.375
Wolfgang, the Doom Raider?

02:40.458 --> 02:42.958
Believe it or not,
Wolfgang wasn't always a villain.

02:43.042 --> 02:45.000
Before he and Pop
were cadets at the academy,

02:45.083 --> 02:47.042
they had aspirations of fame and fortune,

02:47.125 --> 02:50.125
and went by the stage name of
Pop and the Gang.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.708
Originally,
they had an acoustic, folksy vibe,

02:52.792 --> 02:55.417
but like most versatile musical acts,
they evolved.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.708
They were destined for greatness,

02:57.792 --> 03:00.125
until Wolfgang decided
he wanted to be the star of the show.

03:00.208 --> 03:05.542
Well, Pop tried talking sense into
Wolfgang, but his ego was out of control.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.958
And the darkness within
began to take over,

03:08.042 --> 03:11.083
leading him to use his instrument
to force crowds to adore him,

03:11.167 --> 03:13.542
instead of earning it
with actual good music.

03:13.625 --> 03:16.583
Pop realized Wolfgang had succumbed
to the temptation of evil

03:16.667 --> 03:18.542
and there was no going back.

03:19.625 --> 03:23.292
From that day forth,
Wolfgang and Pop became mortal enemies.

03:23.375 --> 03:26.250
Wolfgang continued
to spread disorder and anarchy,

03:26.333 --> 03:30.250
while Pop chose to become a Skylander.
And Pop and the Gang were no more.

03:30.333 --> 03:32.625
Wow. That is one crazy story.

03:32.708 --> 03:36.417
Indeed. But fortunately,
it's a little slice of insanity

03:36.500 --> 03:40.083
we can use to our advantage on the mission
if Pop's new potion works.

03:40.167 --> 03:44.292
Wow, so Professor Pop
is an old-school rock star! Who knew?

03:44.375 --> 03:45.833
I did.
That's why I just told you.

03:47.125 --> 03:51.208
So let's go there! As soon as Pop Fizz
is done with the potion.

03:54.167 --> 03:58.500
Yeah! Skylands Music Festival,

03:58.583 --> 04:01.792
it's time to shred you up
with my bone harp.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.250
Yes, what a cool instrument!

04:04.333 --> 04:08.208
But I've been meaning to ask, Wolfgang,
what exactly is a bone harp?

04:08.292 --> 04:12.208
The bone harp is far from
the most unusual musical instrument, sir.

04:12.292 --> 04:14.375
There's the theremin,
the glass harmonica...

04:14.458 --> 04:16.375
I've dabbled with the dulcimer
from time to time--

04:16.458 --> 04:17.458
Dabble with this, Glumshanks!

04:17.541 --> 04:21.041
Now listen up, you two.
I'm the star of the show, understand?

04:21.125 --> 04:23.708
When I get up there on that stage
and start jamming,

04:23.792 --> 04:27.792
I'll be able to turn everyone
in the audience into a zombie army...

04:27.875 --> 04:29.917
...to be ruled by the Golden Queen.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.583
Your job is to make sure
nobody gets in my way.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.167
So you want us to be your roadies?

04:34.250 --> 04:37.667
Bingo.
And if my set goes off without a hitch,

04:37.750 --> 04:42.792
maybe, just maybe, Golden Queen
will let you join the Doom Raiders.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.625
What?

04:50.708 --> 04:52.917
You? A member of the Doom Raiders?

04:53.000 --> 04:57.667
Yeah, right. Man, sometimes I slay myself.
Now, come on.

04:57.750 --> 05:00.375
It's time to put on our disguises!
Man bun?

05:00.458 --> 05:03.167
Uh, I'll pass.

05:03.250 --> 05:05.500
But... how will you
get past the Skylanders?

05:05.583 --> 05:08.958
My bone harp.
It's all I need to handle those fools.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.542
Hmm?

05:16.208 --> 05:21.875
Wolfgang? You're a wanted criminal!
Also, no ticket, no entry.

05:21.958 --> 05:23.917
Easy, man, it's cool.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.792
I got my ticket right here!

05:27.875 --> 05:32.500
Yes. That is the ticket.
Have a good time, sir.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.667
And remember to hydrate.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.500
He did it, Glummy!
Wolfgang's plan worked!

05:37.583 --> 05:39.958
Hooray...
Let's follow him in.

05:40.042 --> 05:41.375
Nothing I look forward to more

05:41.458 --> 05:44.417
than spending my time
with a bunch of smelly Gen-Y Mabus

05:44.500 --> 05:46.333
who have been baking in the sun all day.

05:51.208 --> 05:52.500
Hey!
No ticket, no entry!

05:52.583 --> 05:54.875
But, but, but, but!

05:54.958 --> 06:00.167
No buts! Also, man buns are so last year!
Back of the line, hipsters!

06:06.250 --> 06:07.875
Well, too bad we couldn't get in, sir,

06:07.958 --> 06:11.375
and, as you've often told me,
anything requiring effort is not worth it.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.917
So, let's just... I don't know,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.583
continue adapting your memoirs
into a Broadway musical?

06:16.667 --> 06:19.333
Oh, no, Glum-ball.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.750
These horrible disguises obviously prove

06:21.833 --> 06:24.542
I will do whatever it takes
to get into this show.

06:24.625 --> 06:28.583
You see, my evil plan is that
once Wolfgang does the dirty work

06:28.667 --> 06:32.125
of turning this crowd
into a zombie army with his music,

06:32.208 --> 06:37.583
that's the moment when I will take
his instrument so I can control everyone!

06:37.667 --> 06:40.125
Oh, the old double-cross.
I like it.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.667
And with all these people
under your control,

06:41.750 --> 06:43.458
no one will be able to stop you, sir.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.583
Including that howling,
has-been rock star.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.833
Exactamundo.
Now let's go.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.417
Pop, finally!
Did you create your anti-hypnotism potion?

06:58.500 --> 06:59.625
Of course I did!

06:59.708 --> 07:01.667
Great! How do we know if it'll work?

07:01.750 --> 07:06.208
I'll use the same
test subject I always do. Me!

07:06.292 --> 07:09.917
Ah! Poppy and fizzy.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.750
Now I just need to create a huge batch
of this stuff, and then we can...

07:17.750 --> 07:18.917
Whoa...

07:19.000 --> 07:20.417
Pop? Are you okay, mate?

07:20.500 --> 07:22.208
Sure. Never better!

07:24.417 --> 07:25.583
Who are all of you?

07:26.417 --> 07:30.833
Oh, and do you know of any good concerts
coming up? I'm a huge music fan.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.083
Oh, good grief.

07:34.292 --> 07:36.083
Hello! The name's Pop Fizz!

07:36.167 --> 07:37.458
I... know.

07:37.542 --> 07:41.083
Whoa!
So my reputation precedes me.

07:41.167 --> 07:42.625
Yeah. It does that sometimes.

07:42.708 --> 07:46.917
Nice to meet you. How's it going?
Sweet bandana, dude.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.042
Now then, Pop, you truly have no idea
who any of us are?

07:52.375 --> 07:54.625
Nope. But I love a good meet and greet.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.917
I host those all the time
after my concerts.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.167
Wait, do you think
you're a musician right now?

07:59.250 --> 08:04.333
Um, I'm only one half of the greatest
folk duo of all time, Pop and the Gang?

08:04.417 --> 08:06.000
You've probably heard of us.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.833
Within the last half hour I have.

08:07.917 --> 08:09.333
It seems as if Pop's potion

08:09.417 --> 08:12.125
has not only made him immune
to Wolfgang's musical spells,

08:12.208 --> 08:15.375
but also reverted his memory
back to their days as a duet.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.625
If it made him immune, you mean.

08:17.708 --> 08:19.625
Right.
Well, there's only one way to find--

08:19.708 --> 08:21.500
What you stealthily whispering about?

08:21.583 --> 08:23.417
Oh, not much, Pop.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.917
It's just that, uh,
we Skylanders are on our mission today

08:27.000 --> 08:30.917
of protecting the Skylands Music Festival,
and we need your help.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.417
So what do you say, buddy?
Up for the challenge?

08:33.500 --> 08:37.417
Wow! I have always wondered
what it'd be like to be a Skylander

08:37.500 --> 08:38.875
- instead of a rock god.
- Well, then!

08:38.957 --> 08:41.332
Consider yourself an honorary member.

08:41.417 --> 08:45.125
But you have to keep your
secret identity just that. Secret.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.292
Can do!

08:46.375 --> 08:48.208
So do you guys want an autograph?

08:48.292 --> 08:51.542
Probably best just to get to the show
and do our job, old sport.

08:53.125 --> 08:56.875
Okay, team, we need eyes everywhere,
on the lookout for anyone up to no good,

08:56.958 --> 08:58.125
but specifically Wolfgang.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.375
My bandmate!

09:00.000 --> 09:04.417
Listen, Pop, Wolfgang isn't who
you think he is and cannot be trusted.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.917
If he's here,
it's because he wants to do harm.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.875
So if you see him, you need to give us
a shout so we can take him down, okay?

09:10.958 --> 09:13.500
-Uh... if you say so.
-Great.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.083
Now, Eruptor, Elf, and I
will go and blend in with the audience

09:16.167 --> 09:19.875
while you use your old-school music cred
to go backstage and patrol there.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.917
Spyro, you will be our eyes in the sky
to guard the perimeter.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.167
Oh, come on, JV, I've never been
to the Skylands Music Festival.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.208
Can't I go in and you take perimeter duty?

09:28.292 --> 09:30.333
Fine, fine, I'll do it.

09:30.417 --> 09:32.667
Just get your ticket out
and let's do this thing already.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.750
Okay. Wait, ticket? What ticket?

09:34.833 --> 09:36.917
Dude, you can't get in without a ticket.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.708
They're pretty serious about it.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.500
Yeah. No ticket, no entry.

09:41.458 --> 09:44.167
Oh, come on, Ka-Boom,
can't you make an exception this one time?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.917
Yeah... no.
No ticket. No entry.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.875
How could you not get a ticket?

09:49.958 --> 09:52.208
I told you that
was imperative to the mission!

09:52.292 --> 09:54.667
I even sent you a calendar reminder
for the ticket on sale.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.625
I told you I never check those things!

09:56.708 --> 09:58.792
Sorry, lad...
but it's perimeter duty for you.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.125
Whoever that dude is,
he should have got a ticket.

10:02.208 --> 10:03.750
Rookie mistake.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.542
Welcome, concertgoers!

10:10.625 --> 10:14.958
Remember, all money spent today
goes back to Skylander Academy,

10:15.042 --> 10:17.583
so open up
those wallets and purses, people.

10:18.292 --> 10:21.667
Now, a few important announcements
before we begin.

10:21.750 --> 10:27.250
First, I'm told the brown funnel cake
that is circulating is a bit dodgy.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.708
It's suggested you stay away from that.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.667
Glumshanks! You call that
being a disaffected hipster?

10:35.750 --> 10:39.792
You can do better than that.
Disaffect, man! Disaffect like the wind!

10:39.875 --> 10:42.958
Well, being a miserable shoegazer
won't be hard.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.125
Ugh, this is going to be the worst.

10:45.208 --> 10:49.542
Hey, bro, we were just saying how we
thought this show was gonna be the worst.

10:49.625 --> 10:53.333
Duh, that's why we bought tickets.
Here, have one.

10:53.417 --> 10:56.458
It's way more fun
to unfairly judge music together.

10:56.542 --> 11:01.208
I... I know I'm supposed to be disaffected
so... I... I guess, I don't care?

11:01.292 --> 11:02.583
Right on, bro.

11:02.667 --> 11:06.583
You're totally the kind of millennial
we can barely tolerate spending time with.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.000
Now remember, Glummy,
when we get to the front of the line,

11:09.083 --> 11:12.667
you take your time pulling out your ID
while I blast Ka-Boom with a shot of...

11:12.750 --> 11:16.208
Hey!
You don't get to befriend my servant!

11:16.292 --> 11:18.333
Only I get to do that!
And... and I would never do that!

11:18.417 --> 11:20.000
But I still reserve the right!

11:20.083 --> 11:21.208
Let me guess...

11:21.292 --> 11:25.833
Something about a lack of a ticket
being related to my prospects for entry?

11:25.917 --> 11:28.250
Boom. Also, Ka-Boom!

11:34.625 --> 11:36.708
My man bun!

11:37.542 --> 11:38.542
You?

11:38.625 --> 11:41.667
I'm gonna crack that big head of yours
open like a giant egg!

11:41.750 --> 11:45.167
Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm gonna... I'll just...

11:45.250 --> 11:48.125
I'm planning on... Look,
I'm not good with on-the-fly one-liners.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.958
Let's just fight!

11:54.375 --> 11:55.958
Stupid Kaos.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.583
Man bun...

12:05.667 --> 12:08.333
I gotta find my teammates
and let them know Kaos is here.

12:08.417 --> 12:11.167
Hey! Gate jumper!
No ticket, no entry!

12:17.958 --> 12:22.708
Hey! You have to have a backstage pass
to be back here... Whoa!

12:22.792 --> 12:25.875
You're that criminal
who used to be a rock star!

12:25.958 --> 12:27.875
Check this out!

12:29.083 --> 12:33.125
Oh, yeah. Totally cool.

12:33.208 --> 12:35.292
Sucker.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.625
Okay, dudes, I'll use my rock star status

12:37.708 --> 12:40.083
to get backstage
and poke around for bad guys.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.625
Maybe I'll run into
some of my old music pals,

12:42.708 --> 12:44.958
like the Bowling Scones, or Jimi Matrix,

12:45.042 --> 12:49.917
or... other band names that are protected
under First Amendment parody rights.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.333
Later!

12:54.292 --> 12:55.417
Wait...

12:55.500 --> 12:58.750
what was the name of the bad guy
I'm supposed to be worried about?

12:58.833 --> 13:02.208
Whoa... Whoa...
What happened?

13:02.292 --> 13:05.125
No idea, but I heard
the brown funnel cake was funky.

13:05.208 --> 13:07.875
Hey, you're Pop Fizz!
From Pop and the Gang!

13:07.958 --> 13:09.000
You got it!

13:09.083 --> 13:11.667
Are you, uh... are you playing today?

13:11.750 --> 13:15.750
I'm not allowed to tell you.
Also... I totally forget.

13:15.833 --> 13:20.708
Well, why else would you be here?
Right this way, sir. You are rock royalty.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.417
Attention, Elliot.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.542
The hitchhikers you picked up
need their medicine out of your ship.

13:25.625 --> 13:28.708
Also, I've been told
no one should eat the nachos.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.833
Something was spotted
drowning in the cheese vat.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.792
Wolfgang?

13:38.875 --> 13:42.708
Pop Fizz!
Hmm, what are you doing here?

13:45.958 --> 13:50.958
Well, if you and I are both here,
the only reasonable explanation can be...

13:51.042 --> 13:53.833
We're about to play
this show together! Right?

13:54.542 --> 13:59.750
Hmm, right you are, brother.
Right. You. Are.

14:02.708 --> 14:08.125
Hmm... Feeling a little rusty,
like I haven't practiced in ten years!

14:08.208 --> 14:10.333
- More like 20.
- Come again?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.333
Nothing. Nothing.
You sound great, man.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.833
Finally, some silence.
Am I right?

14:19.917 --> 14:22.375
I'm still waiting for something
that speaks to me.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.125
Are there no Beat poets on this bill?

14:25.208 --> 14:29.542
"A rat done bit my sister Nell,
but Eon's on the moon!"

14:29.625 --> 14:31.625
Um... what's he talking about?

14:31.708 --> 14:37.125
Dude... I have no idea.
Which must mean it's amazing.

14:37.208 --> 14:42.208
Everyone, an announcement. Don't eat
the soft pretzels. Bad Breath made them.

14:42.292 --> 14:47.375
Oh, hi, Master Eon!

14:47.458 --> 14:50.125
Finally!
I didn't eat a pretzel!

14:50.208 --> 14:55.292
Oh, and no one eat the hot dogs, ever.
Here or anywhere else really.

14:55.375 --> 14:58.500
You have no idea what's in them.
Seriously, don't be gross, people.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.125
Okay, Fizz-man!
It's show time!

15:02.208 --> 15:04.083
Let's go melt some faces!

15:04.167 --> 15:05.208
Wait.

15:05.292 --> 15:10.167
You didn't really think I was gonna
let you come out onto this stage...

15:10.250 --> 15:15.542
without us doing our pre-concert ritual
chest bump? Up high, dude!

15:29.625 --> 15:32.792
Whoa! Is that Pop Fizz?
With Wolfgang?

15:32.875 --> 15:34.250
Oh, no!

15:34.333 --> 15:38.667
Pop's totally forgotten that Wolfgang
is the evil threat we're looking for.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.500
Let's get to the stage, team.

15:42.250 --> 15:46.208
Hey, man, I'll, uh, just start our set by
playing the Skylands national anthem.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.333
-Cool?
-Way cool!

16:04.000 --> 16:07.042
Oh, my eyes are glazing over.

16:07.125 --> 16:12.875
I forgot to wear earplugs
so Wolfgang couldn't entrance me.

16:27.708 --> 16:31.375
Dude, are you seriously adding
a bone harp solo to our national anthem?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.917
Aggressive... but okay!

16:34.833 --> 16:37.250
What a chump!

16:37.333 --> 16:41.333
As soon as I'm done turning everyone else
into a mindless army of drones...

16:41.417 --> 16:42.917
you're next!

16:46.458 --> 16:50.167
Oh, no! Wolfgang!
Now I remember...

16:50.250 --> 16:53.000
You're the bad guy
the Skylanders are looking for!

16:53.083 --> 16:55.250
And I'm a Skylander!
That's it!

16:55.333 --> 16:57.042
I'm not letting you turn this audience

16:57.125 --> 16:59.583
into an army of zombies
with your awful music!

16:59.667 --> 17:03.875
Aw... looks like somebody needs
a little musical therapy.

17:27.291 --> 17:31.417
I knew you'd quit. Just like
you did on our band all those years ago.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.625
We could've been
the biggest band in the world, but no!

17:34.708 --> 17:40.833
You couldn't take my killer solos, so you
gave it all away to be a stupid Skylander.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.000
Well, congrats, Plop Fizz,

17:43.083 --> 17:46.375
'cause now you get to be
a mindless drone like the rest of 'em.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.542
Think again, fang boy!

17:53.917 --> 17:56.958
Tuba solo!

18:03.417 --> 18:07.250
What?
No!

18:07.333 --> 18:09.750
Now for the big finish!

18:10.917 --> 18:12.208
Ha-yah!

18:17.292 --> 18:20.333
Whoa...
What happened?

18:20.417 --> 18:22.833
Everyone... you're okay.

18:22.917 --> 18:26.708
Wolfgang turned you all into an army
of drones with his awful music.

18:26.792 --> 18:30.583
But I somehow ended up here on stage
and was able to stop him.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.917
Should we go get Wolfgang?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.333
Capital idea!

18:39.417 --> 18:42.000
-Whoa! What the--
-Well, what's wrong, Wolfy?

18:42.083 --> 18:44.125
Not sticking around
for the encore?

18:59.875 --> 19:02.292
Oh, I know you don't have a ticket.

19:09.875 --> 19:14.792
Whoa! What a rush! I have
literally zero idea of how I got here.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.083
But still... Whoo-hoo!

19:21.875 --> 19:26.125
Oh, yeah, Pop!
You are the man! Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

19:26.208 --> 19:27.708
Rock it!

19:29.417 --> 19:30.750
-I got you, buddy.
-Oh, pulled it again. Ow!

19:30.833 --> 19:32.125
Ow!

19:32.208 --> 19:34.875
Oh...

19:39.833 --> 19:41.208
Whoo-hoo!
You did it, Pop!

19:41.292 --> 19:44.667
I sure did!
Whatever it was.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.500
Anyone actually know how I ended up here?

19:47.583 --> 19:50.542
You were testing a potion that was
supposed to protect everyone

19:50.625 --> 19:55.500
from Wolfgang's bone harp...
but it erased your memory instead.

19:55.583 --> 19:59.250
Yo, yo, yo!
Sweet tunes, Pop Fizz.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.167
And you are not
messing around with that tuba.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.708
Or is that a...
is that a sousaphone?

20:02.792 --> 20:05.208
Spyro! You finally got in?

20:05.292 --> 20:08.458
Yep, and you are not going to believe how.
You see, there I was patrolling the skies,

20:08.542 --> 20:10.958
and who slams into me mid-air but Kaos!

20:11.042 --> 20:13.750
Anyway, we hit the ground
and the fight was on.

20:13.833 --> 20:16.167
So first, he tries to grab me, right?
Well, he tries to, you know,

20:16.250 --> 20:18.875
'cause he does the Kaos thing,
so he like, he... he thinks I'm not--

20:18.958 --> 20:20.375
You again?

20:21.500 --> 20:22.958
Hey!

20:23.042 --> 20:25.625
Broke the number one rule
of any concert.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.083
What, don't eat the hot dogs?

20:27.167 --> 20:28.875
No!

20:28.958 --> 20:31.708
No ticket, no entry!

20:33.583 --> 20:36.333
Easy, Ka-Boom.
Spyro and the rest of the team

20:36.417 --> 20:38.500
were deep undercover
to stop a threat to the festival,

20:38.583 --> 20:41.917
which they did
in the form of Wolfgang and Kaos.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.083
You can let Spyro go.

20:45.625 --> 20:50.375
So... can you just hurry up and take us
away so I can start plotting my escape?

20:50.458 --> 20:52.292
Right, my bad.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.875
So, Pop, you defeated
your nemesis, Wolfgang,

20:54.958 --> 20:58.292
you're on stage for the first time
in years, and you've got your tuba.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.250
How about an encore?
For old time's sake?

21:01.333 --> 21:05.042
Well... I've always wondered
what would've been,

21:05.125 --> 21:08.958
if I had continued my music career
instead of becoming a Skylander.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.250
So... let's blow!

21:16.167 --> 21:20.208
Wow. He has no idea
how to play that thing, does he?

21:20.292 --> 21:24.167
No. But Pop Fizz
being on that stage proved integral

21:24.250 --> 21:28.208
to stopping Wolfgang and saving
the Skylands from his evil spell.

21:28.292 --> 21:32.000
Even if he is apparently tone deaf.
And that's the important thing.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.250
You're right, Eon.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.542
Earplugs then?

21:36.542 --> 21:38.333
- Oh, yeah, I'll take those.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:38.417 --> 21:40.208
-Oh, yeah, definitely.
-Good. Good. Thank you.
