10:12.068 --> 10:13.551
- Yes.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.310
You just have to publish
with the right place.

10:15.379 --> 10:16.482
And, of course,
that's Empirical.

10:16.551 --> 10:18.137
- Or Millennial.

10:18.206 --> 10:20.724
We have a great track record.

10:20.793 --> 10:23.689
Our goal is to publish authors
with original voices.

10:23.758 --> 10:25.586
We also just signed
a first-look deal

10:25.655 --> 10:27.793
with Reese Witherspoon's
production company,

10:27.862 --> 10:30.413
which puts us
in a very unique position.

10:30.482 --> 10:32.655
- And one of the benefits
of going with Empirical

10:32.724 --> 10:34.310
there is no big, splashy,
