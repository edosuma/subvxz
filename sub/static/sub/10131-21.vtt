16:39.666 --> 16:40.750
- Ah.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.003
Adorably cute.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.003
Take your money.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.506
- Will you stop it, Joey?

16:44.044 --> 16:46.506
- Take the money.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.882
Can't believe you're still

16:46.547 --> 16:47.882
doing this. Knock it off.

16:47.924 --> 16:50.259
I can't believe

16:47.924 --> 16:50.259
you won't take it.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.928
Hello, boys.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.932
Hi.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.142
- Hello.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.603
Guys, I'd like you

16:58.184 --> 17:00.603
to meet, uh..

17:00.645 --> 17:02.021
I'm sorry,

17:00.645 --> 17:02.021
I didn't catch your real name.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.189
Marilyn.

17:03.230 --> 17:04.983
There's a coincidence

17:03.230 --> 17:04.983
for you.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.818
Marilyn, this is Larry,

17:05.024 --> 17:06.818
this is Moe

17:06.860 --> 17:08.903
'and the little one's curly.'

17:11.656 --> 17:13.783
Get this, the show offered me

17:11.656 --> 17:13.783
the job as Elvis

17:13.825 --> 17:15.326
for as long as I want

17:13.825 --> 17:15.326
or until I..

17:15.368 --> 17:17.453
[imitating Elvis]

17:15.368 --> 17:17.453
Dislocate my hips.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.205
- Hey, congratulations.

17:17.495 --> 17:19.205
- Great.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.375
- Congratulations.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.375
- Thank you. Thanks.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.378
I don't know what

17:22.416 --> 17:25.378
I'm going to do, though, guys.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
I mean, uh...

17:25.419 --> 17:27.046
tell me something, Marilyn.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.506
I mean, doesn't it ever

17:27.087 --> 17:28.506
get to you, you know

17:28.548 --> 17:30.717
pretending to be

17:28.548 --> 17:30.717
Marilyn Monroe?

17:30.758 --> 17:31.885
Pretending?

17:31.926 --> 17:34.679
I am Marilyn Monroe, silly.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.644
- Yeah.

17:40.184 --> 17:41.644
- Fine.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.270
Sure. Yeah.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.523
Uh, if you'll excuse us..

17:45.565 --> 17:46.983
...Ms. Monroe..

17:47.025 --> 17:48.860
...we have to put

17:47.025 --> 17:48.860
the baby to bed.

17:48.902 --> 17:52.071
By the way, I loved your work

17:48.902 --> 17:52.071
in "Some Like It Hot."

17:53.698 --> 17:56.242
Guess they're funny, huh?

17:59.871 --> 18:01.789
Will you stop

17:59.871 --> 18:01.789
bothering me?

18:01.831 --> 18:04.500
I am trying

18:01.831 --> 18:04.500
to make a sandwich.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.086
I need a knife.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.089
Knife, kn..

18:07.127 --> 18:10.089
Ah! Knife.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.303
Joey, allow me

18:13.968 --> 18:16.303
to demonstrate

18:16.345 --> 18:18.848
how a mature adult

18:16.345 --> 18:18.848
constructs a sandwich.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.475
Okay. Go for it,

18:18.890 --> 18:21.475
Mr. Adult.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.728
First, my friend, we start

18:23.770 --> 18:25.312
with a clean knife.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.024
We take two slices of bread.

18:28.066 --> 18:31.444
On the left slice,

18:28.066 --> 18:31.444
mayonnaise. Hmm.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.864
And on the right slice,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.864
mustard.

18:34.906 --> 18:36.866
I'll bet you get

18:34.906 --> 18:36.866
another knife.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.242
Have to.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.871
Another clean knife.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.539
And then the mustard

18:43.581 --> 18:45.583
we paint it on.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.085
Hmm.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.253
Now it's time

18:47.126 --> 18:49.253
for the ham and cheese

18:49.295 --> 18:52.131
and we alternate

18:49.295 --> 18:52.131
ham, cheese

18:52.172 --> 18:53.841
'ham, cheese.'

18:53.883 --> 18:55.802
So that in every bite

18:55.843 --> 18:56.844
we have an equal amount

18:56.886 --> 18:58.763
of ham and cheese.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.516
You don't need

18:59.973 --> 19:02.516
therapy, do you?

19:02.558 --> 19:03.601
Is that supposed

19:02.558 --> 19:03.601
to be funny?

19:03.643 --> 19:04.811
I knew you'd say that.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.981
"I knew you'd say that?"

19:08.022 --> 19:09.857
What is that

19:08.022 --> 19:09.857
supposed to mean?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.109
It means that you

19:11.150 --> 19:12.860
are the most

19:11.150 --> 19:12.860
predictable person

19:12.902 --> 19:14.821
on the face

19:12.902 --> 19:14.821
of this earth.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.363
I know everything

19:14.862 --> 19:16.363
you're gonna say

19:16.405 --> 19:17.949
even before you say it.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.159
- Oh, do you?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.536
See? You are so

19:20.200 --> 19:22.536
paint-by-the-numbers

19:22.578 --> 19:25.832
that, even if the slightest

19:22.578 --> 19:25.832
little thing falls out of place

19:25.873 --> 19:27.333
you can't handle it.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.584
- That's not true.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.422
Well, let's just see

19:30.169 --> 19:33.422
how true it is.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.926
[humming]

19:41.848 --> 19:44.183
Look at that crumb.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.769
'It's driving you nuts,

19:45.351 --> 19:46.769
isn't it?'

19:48.437 --> 19:49.480
Doesn't bother me.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.858
Oh, no.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.484
Doesn't bother you?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.986
[laughing]

19:55.028 --> 19:56.654
But what if..

19:56.696 --> 19:58.614
[gasp]

20:01.575 --> 20:03.828
There's two crumbs!

20:05.496 --> 20:09.083
'They're getting bigger

20:05.496 --> 20:09.083
and bigger and bigger.'

20:09.125 --> 20:11.127
'Don't touch them.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.127
They're alive!'

20:12.252 --> 20:14.005
This place is a pigsty.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.715
[imitating a pig]

20:15.756 --> 20:18.425
Oh, sure.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.425
Sure, make jokes.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.302
Because everything

20:18.467 --> 20:20.302
is a joke to you.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.805
Mr. Comedian.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.932
That's right.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.932
You only go around once.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.894
You might as well get

20:24.974 --> 20:27.894
all the smiles in you can.

20:27.935 --> 20:29.562
Smiles are great.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.899
But you are almost 30-years-old

20:29.603 --> 20:32.899
and you still watch cartoons.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.692
It's like living

20:32.940 --> 20:34.692
with Pee-Wee Herman.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.111
[imitates Pee-Wee]

20:34.734 --> 20:37.111
Well, sticks and stones

20:34.734 --> 20:37.111
may break my bones

20:37.153 --> 20:39.279
but names will never

20:37.153 --> 20:39.279
hurt me.

20:41.032 --> 20:42.616
[screaming]

20:49.874 --> 20:52.960
[screaming]

20:54.128 --> 20:56.172
Joey!

20:57.757 --> 20:59.341
Take this.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.301
[screaming]

21:02.929 --> 21:04.638
You are such a baby.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.307
I know you are,

21:04.680 --> 21:07.307
but what am I?

21:07.349 --> 21:09.268
Okay. Let's settle this

21:07.349 --> 21:09.268
like we used to

21:09.309 --> 21:10.519
in the old days.

21:10.561 --> 21:11.771
- Arm wrestling.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.898
See? I know everything

21:11.812 --> 21:13.898
you're gonna say.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.734
Fine. Whoever loses

21:13.940 --> 21:16.734
has to keeps the $800.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.986
Sounds fair to me.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.986
Okay.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.530
- One, two three.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.616
I can't even remember

21:21.572 --> 21:23.616
the last time we did this.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.410
June 22, 1979.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.495
Why do you remember

21:26.452 --> 21:28.495
all this stuff?

21:28.537 --> 21:29.830
I don't want

21:28.537 --> 21:29.830
the money back.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.249
- Guys.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.249
- Stop it, I've had it with you.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.374
- Joey, I don't want the money.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.374
- Guys..

21:32.416 --> 21:34.334
Guys! Fellas!

21:35.544 --> 21:36.963
There's something

21:35.544 --> 21:36.963
a little more important

21:37.004 --> 21:38.631
than what you're

21:37.004 --> 21:38.631
arguing about.

21:38.672 --> 21:40.758
Me.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.427
Fellas, I'm confused.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.304
I don't know whether or not

21:43.469 --> 21:45.304
to take this Elvis gig or not.

21:45.345 --> 21:47.098
I mean...I think

21:45.345 --> 21:47.098
I should probably be

21:47.140 --> 21:49.934
concentrating on my own music,

21:47.140 --> 21:49.934
don't you?

21:49.976 --> 21:51.685
I think you should

21:49.976 --> 21:51.685
take the job.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.272
You need the money

21:51.727 --> 21:54.272
for your demo tape.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.940
Jess, the only reason

21:54.313 --> 21:55.940
you should listen to him

21:55.982 --> 21:58.776
is if you lost a mitten

21:55.982 --> 21:58.776
when you were four.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.320
As for the job, hey,

21:58.818 --> 22:01.320
I saw you out there tonight.

22:01.361 --> 22:03.156
You were singing

22:01.361 --> 22:03.156
songs that you love

22:03.197 --> 22:04.865
just having a blast.

22:04.907 --> 22:06.075
That's why

22:04.907 --> 22:06.075
you should do it.

22:06.117 --> 22:07.201
For fun.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.494
- He needs the money!

22:07.243 --> 22:08.494
- For fun.

22:08.535 --> 22:09.745
- For money!

22:08.535 --> 22:09.745
- For fun!

22:09.787 --> 22:12.665
- For money!

22:09.787 --> 22:12.665
- For fun and money.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.208
Thank you, guys.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.208
That's good advice.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.501
I think I'm gonna

22:14.250 --> 22:15.501
take the job.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.502
Thanks.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.171
(both)

22:16.543 --> 22:18.171
You're welcome.

22:18.212 --> 22:19.421
- Don't say you're welcome.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.300
You know, I don't know what

22:22.341 --> 22:23.926
I'd do without you guys..

22:23.968 --> 22:26.053
...but I'm gonna look into it.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.313
You know, that was, uh,

22:32.643 --> 22:35.313
good advice you gave Jesse.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.857
Thanks. I, uh, thought

22:35.353 --> 22:37.857
yours was great, too.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.651
I think we really helped him.

22:40.693 --> 22:43.654
Well, yes. That's 'cause

22:40.693 --> 22:43.654
we make a great team.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.240
I guess that's why

22:44.822 --> 22:46.240
we've stayed friends

22:46.282 --> 22:48.492
For 19 years..

22:48.534 --> 22:50.452
...four months

22:48.534 --> 22:50.452
and three days.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.498
'Cause maybe

22:51.495 --> 22:54.498
I'm a little...square.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.209
And I'm a little goofy.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.544
You know what?

22:58.585 --> 23:00.004
Between the two of us..

23:00.046 --> 23:02.256
...we make

23:00.046 --> 23:02.256
one hell of a guy.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.716
That makes sense, I mean..

23:03.757 --> 23:05.218
We've always been there

23:03.757 --> 23:05.218
for each other, I mean

23:05.259 --> 23:07.385
you were there when

23:05.259 --> 23:07.385
I needed that 800 bucks.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.013
And you were there

23:07.427 --> 23:09.013
when I needed to have somebody

23:09.055 --> 23:11.224
help me take care

23:09.055 --> 23:11.224
of my kids.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.433
I can never repay you

23:11.265 --> 23:13.433
for that.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.020
You never need to.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.604
Danny, look,

23:16.062 --> 23:17.604
a debt is a debt.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.065
I just want to clear

23:17.646 --> 23:19.065
ours up, so here.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.359
Please take the money.

23:21.399 --> 23:23.027
Okay.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.653
Thank you.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.366
But I'm buying you a savings

23:26.697 --> 23:28.366
bond and a closet organizer.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.742
- No, you're not.

23:28.406 --> 23:29.742
- Yes, I am.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.451
- No, you're not.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.451
- It's my money now.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.995
- Make your bed.
