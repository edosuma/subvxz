[theme music continues]

00:42.083 --> 00:45.462
[roars]

00:55.555 --> 00:57.640
[epic music]

01:15.450 --> 01:18.912
Are we really off the island
or is this a dream?

01:18.995 --> 01:20.205
If it were a dream,

01:20.288 --> 01:22.457
I'm thinking we'd have a change
of clothes.

01:22.540 --> 01:23.666
Ha! What do you mean?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.710
I've always wanted a signature look.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.629
[chuckles]

01:27.712 --> 01:30.298
[laughter]

01:35.136 --> 01:38.348
[laughter continues]

01:56.157 --> 01:58.118
Hey, Captain. It's lunchtime.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.787
[Kenji] Can't leave my post
till we're docked in Costa Rica.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.373
I'm the only one of us
who's ever sailed before.

02:03.456 --> 02:05.333
[scoffs]
How hard can it be?

02:05.416 --> 02:06.751
"Iceberg! Iceberg!"

02:06.835 --> 02:08.086
[laughs]

02:08.169 --> 02:10.171
Hilarious. I'm not leaving.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.257
Come on, Kenji, just cut the engine.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.716
Ten minutes won't kill you.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.761
[Brooklynn]
It might be our last meal together.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.723
[engine turns off]

02:39.742 --> 02:42.495
And now, for the main course,

02:42.579 --> 02:45.707
-the plumpest and the juiciest…
-[Sammy gasps]

02:46.583 --> 02:48.543
Nublar grubs!

02:48.626 --> 02:51.629
-Ugh! Ew!
-[Ben] Hand-selected by yours truly.

02:53.923 --> 02:56.259
Thank you for your sacrifice.

02:56.342 --> 02:57.427
-[Ben munching]
-Ugh!

02:57.510 --> 02:58.344
-Ew!
-Ugh!

02:58.428 --> 03:00.138
-[Yaz] Come on.
-Do you have to do that here?

03:00.221 --> 03:01.139
Why?

03:01.222 --> 03:02.098
[clicks tongue]
Ah!

03:05.018 --> 03:06.352
[gulps]

03:06.436 --> 03:10.106
Well, I guess the least I can do
is keep an open mind.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.275
[gulps]

03:13.067 --> 03:14.152
[Sammy grunts]

03:14.235 --> 03:16.237

03:17.113 --> 03:18.197
[gasps]

03:18.865 --> 03:19.824
[gasps]

03:20.783 --> 03:21.826
Do it.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.663
[yelps]
Uh-uh.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.415
-[screams]
-[grunts]

03:27.498 --> 03:29.250
[panicked screaming]

03:29.334 --> 03:31.002
[shouts]

03:31.085 --> 03:33.796
-[panting]
-How you all survived, I'll never know.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.090
[munching]

03:37.425 --> 03:38.384
[Sammy sighs]

03:38.927 --> 03:42.722
Okay. No tears or goodbyes
until we're sittin' on the plane,

03:42.805 --> 03:45.767
but can I just say, look at us.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.937
We started as campers, and now, we're--

03:49.020 --> 03:50.146
-Immortal.
-Survivors?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.189
Exhausted.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.982
I was gonna say soulmates.

03:53.483 --> 03:56.861
Still doesn't feel real.
We finally made it off the island.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.404
Go us.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.074
I'm gonna miss you guys so much!

04:01.574 --> 04:02.450
[sighs]

04:03.159 --> 04:04.535
Before we get off this boat,

04:04.619 --> 04:06.871
I'll need everyone to write down
their e-mail addresses,

04:06.955 --> 04:09.999
social media handles, and weekly
availabilities for a group check-in.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.501
Also, your favorite kind of cake

04:11.584 --> 04:13.711
and the best time of day
to receive packages.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.756
And maybe, I don't know, for fun,
your favorite memory of the two of us.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.759
Hey, who took my food?

04:19.842 --> 04:22.720
I had a bunch of berries
sitting right there.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.181
Wasn't me.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.268
Maybe the boat is haunted.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.520
-Oh, Yaz, no!
-[Yaz laughs]

04:30.603 --> 04:32.939
-[Sammy] Don't even joke.
-[laughter]

04:33.022 --> 04:37.819
No sea sickness anymore, Ben?
What, did the island beat it out of you?

04:37.902 --> 04:39.946
When you've seen the things I've seen,

04:40.029 --> 04:43.199
a little thing
like motion sickness can't… Oh!

04:43.700 --> 04:45.326
[Ben] Who ate all the grubs?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.453
-[Brooklynn] Not if you paid me.
-[Yaz] Truly, no one.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.163
-[faint clicking]
-[gasps]

04:50.164 --> 04:50.999
[clicking]

04:54.002 --> 04:55.878
[squeaking]

04:55.962 --> 04:57.088
[relieved sighs]

04:57.797 --> 05:00.174
Of course. A stowaway.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.136
The last thing we need is it chewing
on some wires or something.

05:03.219 --> 05:04.846
[snorts, squeaks]

05:07.348 --> 05:10.435
What do you say we catch one last Compy?
For old times' sake.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.145
-[giggling]
-Let's go! Yeah, Compy!

05:12.228 --> 05:13.229
Woohoo!

05:15.064 --> 05:18.776
-Listen, man, about what happened--
-I should be at the controls.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.903
I'm trying to get us all home.

05:22.655 --> 05:26.784
Seriously? I only did what Brooklynn
asked me to do. What's your problem?

05:26.868 --> 05:29.746
For once, when you have to do
the right thing,

05:29.829 --> 05:32.915
I'd like to see you put
this group first. Just once!

05:32.999 --> 05:33.958
Kenji!

05:43.468 --> 05:44.761
[grumbles]

05:44.844 --> 05:47.638
Hey. You and I know
you didn't do anything wrong.

05:47.722 --> 05:49.390
Down deep, he knows it, too.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.434
There's gotta be another reason
he's so upset.

05:51.517 --> 05:55.146
Yeah, well, maybe it's because
he's such a… such a…

05:55.229 --> 05:56.773
kind of… kind of a…

05:57.315 --> 05:59.692
[sighs]
I'm not good at insults.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.820
You have other qualities.
Just let me handle it.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.405
I speak Kenji.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.866
It involves me saying "bro"
more than I care to,

06:06.949 --> 06:08.743
but I'll find out what's up.

06:11.913 --> 06:13.247
-[Compy screeching]
-[Ben] Dang it!

06:13.331 --> 06:14.248
-[screams]
-Whoa!

06:14.332 --> 06:15.416
I got it!

06:15.500 --> 06:16.959
-[grunts]
-Whoa!

06:17.043 --> 06:18.795
[grunts]

06:18.878 --> 06:22.006
-[grunting]
-[screeching]

06:23.800 --> 06:25.093
[grunts]

06:26.385 --> 06:29.430
-[groans]
-[grunts]

06:29.514 --> 06:30.640
[Yaz] Ah!

06:31.224 --> 06:32.975
[panting]

06:33.059 --> 06:35.019
[Sammy] Okay, where'd it go?

06:47.073 --> 06:49.408
[whispers]
Ben, you stay and guard the food.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.870
Sammy and Yaz, you search the cabins.
I'll check the rest of the boat.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.210
[Kenji] That stupid dinosaur's
had bust literally everything.

06:59.293 --> 07:00.128
[sighs]

07:00.211 --> 07:02.421
What are they,
anti-technology or something?

07:02.505 --> 07:05.341
[Brooklynn] Hey, bro, stop stressing.

07:05.424 --> 07:09.220
Check it, smooth sailing
to Costa Rica, ka-ching!

07:09.303 --> 07:12.723
There's nothing out here
that could be worse than Dino Island.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.435
I mean, you could just chillax.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.354
Chillax? What about sharks, or storms,

07:18.438 --> 07:21.732
or the lunch tray covering the hole
and the boat falling off?

07:21.816 --> 07:25.278
Lots of things could happen, Brooklynn,
and without SONAR or a radio,

07:25.361 --> 07:26.779
I'm not chillaxing.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.158
So, you freaked out on Darius
because you're worried?

07:30.241 --> 07:31.909
What? No! He…

07:32.952 --> 07:34.120
You could have been killed.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.289
He did what I told him to.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.499
If there's anyone
you should be mad at, it's me.

07:40.418 --> 07:43.713
I need to get the comm working,
and captaining is kind of a solo job,

07:43.796 --> 07:44.964
so if you don't mind.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.216
Nice use of "comm".

07:47.300 --> 07:50.511
Also, if you're looking for
the reset switch on the comm panel,

07:50.595 --> 07:51.929
you may want to use the panel

07:52.013 --> 07:55.850
that's, um, actually attached
to the comm system.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.103
Just saying.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.396
-[rumbling]
-Whoa!

08:00.480 --> 08:01.856
[breathes heavily]
What was that?

08:03.232 --> 08:06.569
-If we had working SONAR, we'd know.
-[Ben] Did you guys feel that?

08:07.820 --> 08:09.655
[Kenji] Probably just
a swell or something!

08:09.739 --> 08:12.742
Captain K's got it under control.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.495
[foreboding music]

08:18.289 --> 08:23.252
-Okay. Let's see. What's next?
-Just to be safe,

08:23.336 --> 08:29.509
what if I stay and fix that SONAR
for you, bro?

08:40.436 --> 08:41.646
[metal clanking]

08:46.692 --> 08:49.362
[Brooklynn] They used a real
old-school fuse holding.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.739
No wonder it came loose. Pliers?

08:59.205 --> 09:00.164
[chuckles]

09:04.001 --> 09:05.002
[clears throat]

09:05.086 --> 09:08.130
So, uh, how do you know so much
about this stuff?

09:08.214 --> 09:10.424
Did you unbox the Titanic or something?
[chuckles]

09:10.508 --> 09:15.054
Har-har. My dad's taught me, actually.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.431
-Really?
-Yeah. Tape?

09:18.015 --> 09:20.560
When we moved to London,
I had a hard time making friends,

09:20.643 --> 09:23.271
so I spent a lot of Saturdays
helping them in the garage.

09:23.354 --> 09:28.067
I get it. Kids my age were super judgy
about how rich I…

09:28.150 --> 09:32.321
I mostly hung out with the adults, too.
Not my dad so much, but…

09:32.405 --> 09:35.658
Is that why you freaked out on Darius?
You don't wanna go home?

09:35.741 --> 09:36.951
[laughs]
What?

09:37.034 --> 09:40.079
No, no, I was just trying to say
I could relate.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.789
You learned how to fix stuff.

09:41.872 --> 09:45.084
I learned how to look awesome
and drive a boat.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.252
[chuckles]

09:48.796 --> 09:49.672
What?

09:50.631 --> 09:55.469
When I first met you,
you did not make a good impression.

09:55.553 --> 09:59.974
I was like, "That guy and I
will never be friends."

10:00.057 --> 10:05.104
But now, out of all of us, I…
I think you and I might be the most alike.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.066
I'm gonna miss you, Kenj.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.531
[Brooklynn] Screwdriver?

10:16.240 --> 10:18.451
[tools clanking]

10:28.127 --> 10:29.128
[Sammy shudders]

10:30.087 --> 10:32.006
Here, Compy, Compy.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.593
Please don't make me stay in this room
a second longer than I have to.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.306
Welp, not in here. Where to next?

10:40.389 --> 10:44.769
Uh, just a sec. I know you're having
a hard time saying goodbye,

10:44.852 --> 10:48.272
and I, uh, wanted to make it easier.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.651
I drew a picture of all of us
from day one on the ferry ride over.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.612
I couldn't remember everything
and it could be better, but here.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.739
[chuckles]
[Sammy] Oh!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.491
Yaz!

10:59.075 --> 11:01.160
You can get everyone
to put their deets on it.

11:02.161 --> 11:06.165
Speed, strength, brains,
a bright artistic future?

11:06.248 --> 11:08.334
What doesn't this girl have?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.419
-[Darius] Compy's headed for the deck!
-[Sammy gasps]

11:11.003 --> 11:13.089
It's here somewhere. Anyone see it?

11:13.172 --> 11:15.841
I figured I'd pack everything up
before it could get to it.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.927
We'll find it. Fan out.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.011
Oh, real quick, guys.

11:19.095 --> 11:21.597
I know we're in the middle
of a dino chase, but if I could just

11:21.680 --> 11:24.392
get all of you to put your info
on Yaz's incredible drawin'…

11:26.018 --> 11:28.229
Later. Got it. Cool, cool, cool.

11:30.314 --> 11:31.816
Let's see if that did it.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.362
[whirring]

11:36.445 --> 11:37.780
-[Kenji chuckles]
-[Brooklynn] Yes!

11:37.863 --> 11:39.365
-[laughter]
-Yes!

11:39.448 --> 11:44.662
I can't believe you got that to work.
What… Ah! You're so amazing!

11:45.204 --> 11:48.249
At tech! I mean, you know,
tech… technology.

11:50.709 --> 11:52.670
Kenji, listen.

11:53.754 --> 11:55.714
We're all gonna go our separate ways soon.

11:55.798 --> 12:00.886
This is kinda hard to admit, but…

12:01.595 --> 12:04.014
this is probably
the first group of real friends

12:04.098 --> 12:07.143
that you and I have ever had,

12:07.226 --> 12:08.853
and the thought of saying goodbye

12:08.936 --> 12:11.313
to someone you're not ready
to let go of is scary.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.942
Maybe that's why
you're so upset with Darius.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.069
[Brooklynn] You're gonna miss him.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.790
You're right! That's…

12:30.624 --> 12:32.501
That's why I've been weird.

12:32.585 --> 12:37.006
I knew it! Brooklynn unboxes Kenji.
My greatest challenge yet.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.634
Promise me you'll talk to him
before we leave?

12:44.138 --> 12:45.473
[engine starts]

12:45.556 --> 12:47.558

12:51.020 --> 12:52.521
[high-pitched squeal]

12:53.522 --> 12:55.399
[Darius whispers]
Ben, distract it.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.214
[both grunting]

13:19.131 --> 13:22.301
-What is happening?
-Shoot. Shoot, no!

13:24.303 --> 13:25.137
[gasps]

13:25.846 --> 13:27.932
I don't think it's a mechanical failure.

13:28.015 --> 13:30.476
We might be stuck
in a kelp bed or something.

13:30.559 --> 13:31.727
[beeps]

13:31.810 --> 13:34.396
[Kenji] Dang it! I must have missed that
when I turning the boat.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.274
[Ben] Uh, guys, what's happening?

13:37.775 --> 13:39.151
Propeller's jammed.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.986
Someone's gotta go under and check it out.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.696
Cap thinks we're stuck in kelp.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.075
And where there's a kelp forest,
there are usually sharks.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.370
Sharks? I'll pass.

13:49.453 --> 13:52.706
Saw this movie as a kid
that really messed me up for life.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.086
[ominous music]

13:57.711 --> 13:58.754
I'll do it.

14:04.468 --> 14:05.719
[grunts]

14:05.803 --> 14:07.596
You sure you're okay to go alone?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.890
I'll be fine. Just be ready to pull me up.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.568
[Darius inhales]

14:33.497 --> 14:37.626
[beeping]

14:40.004 --> 14:41.630

[exhales]

15:03.277 --> 15:06.363
-He's up!
-The propeller was stuck in kelp.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.534
Tell Kenji to try it now.
I'll stay in the water just in case.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.744
Yeah, on it!

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
Darius got it. Try moving forward.

15:15.706 --> 15:16.790
[engine rumbles]

15:23.255 --> 15:25.799
[beeping]

15:26.926 --> 15:28.385
We're all-clear!

15:28.469 --> 15:30.846
-[Darius] Whoo!
-Yeah, all right!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.014

15:46.487 --> 15:47.655
What is that?

15:49.156 --> 15:51.158
-[Brooklynn] It looks big.
-[Kenji] Uh…

15:52.076 --> 15:55.245
-Must be a school of fish?
-Given our luck?

15:55.955 --> 15:56.997
[both gasp]

15:57.081 --> 15:58.332
Tell them to hurry!

15:58.415 --> 15:59.833
There's something in the water!

15:59.917 --> 16:01.001
It's headed this way!

16:02.836 --> 16:03.671
Huh?

[both grunt]

16:12.513 --> 16:13.973
Back up the boat!

16:15.057 --> 16:16.350
It's not working!

16:16.934 --> 16:18.143
Darius!

16:18.227 --> 16:19.645
[panting]

16:24.191 --> 16:27.403
-[Kenji] No, no, no, no!
-[Brooklynn] What is it?

16:27.486 --> 16:28.946
-Shark!
-[gasps]

16:29.029 --> 16:30.030
Shark?

16:30.531 --> 16:32.950
[Yaz] There. It's heading right
for Darius.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
Where'd it go?

16:36.829 --> 16:39.456
[beeping]

16:39.540 --> 16:40.541
It's right on us!

16:40.624 --> 16:43.627
[shudders, yelps]

16:43.711 --> 16:45.713
Pull him in faster! The boat's drifting!

[beeping]

17:18.954 --> 17:20.372
We gotta get him outta there!

17:20.456 --> 17:23.083
Is there a life preserver?
Or another rope?

17:23.167 --> 17:26.336
[beeping]

17:26.420 --> 17:27.838
[both gasp]

17:28.547 --> 17:31.550

Is… Is that the Mosasaurus?

17:46.398 --> 17:50.944
-How the heck did it get out here?
-We gotta get Darius out! Now!

17:51.028 --> 17:54.448
Brooklynn, you stay at the wheel,
the rest of you, be ready to pull us up!

17:59.036 --> 18:01.538

You saved me.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.861
Of course, I saved you.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.822
We got each other's backs
for life, junior.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.097
[Sammy] Maybe we shouldn't go in there.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.099
Can't be worse than where we've been.
